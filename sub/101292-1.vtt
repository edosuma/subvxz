01:16.814 --> 01:18.484
<i>Love is a wonderful thing.</i>

01:20.588 --> 01:24.897
<i>You meet, you fall in love and
you get married. In that order.</i>

01:29.807 --> 01:34.482
<i>But love, like life,
is never perfectly arranged.</i>

01:52.552 --> 01:55.024
Sorry, Jeff,
we have to go visiting.

01:55.057 --> 01:57.896
- Always?
- Come on, Robert.

01:57.930 --> 01:59.934
My dad says we have
to show respect.

02:06.079 --> 02:07.515
- Good to go?
- Yep.

02:28.992 --> 02:30.594
Go and sit with the men.

02:30.628 --> 02:31.630
Oh, I can't play cards.

02:49.934 --> 02:50.969
Mama.

03:03.694 --> 03:05.631
<i>There was a time
when arranged marriages</i>

03:05.664 --> 03:07.168
<i>were not uncommon
in our community.</i>

03:09.639 --> 03:10.774
<i>Someone knew someone</i>

03:10.809 --> 03:12.178
<i>who was suitable to someone.</i>

03:14.682 --> 03:15.551
Them two?

03:18.958 --> 03:20.527
What do you think, <i>compare?</i>

03:20.561 --> 03:21.931
<i>It was the way it was.</i>

03:26.006 --> 03:28.845
<i>We even had a word</i>
<i>for it,</i> combinare.

03:30.180 --> 03:31.116
<i>To arrange.</i>

03:39.098 --> 03:42.873
<i>But the world was
changing and so were we.</i>

03:42.906 --> 03:44.709
<i>Some of us sooner than others.</i>

04:09.826 --> 04:11.864
Is <i>Compare</i> Joe the Godfather?

04:12.999 --> 04:16.206
Well, yes,
he is your godfather.

04:16.238 --> 04:17.141
You know what I mean.

04:19.678 --> 04:20.613
I've read the book.

04:21.683 --> 04:24.423
Look, Angela,
<i>Compare</i> Joe's family,

04:24.456 --> 04:27.294
like your dad's,
have been here a long time.

04:27.328 --> 04:29.699
Helped lots of people
in business.

04:29.732 --> 04:30.667
Look at me.

04:32.338 --> 04:33.707
<i>Grazie,</i> I'll take those.

04:36.947 --> 04:38.316
Think big, Joe.

04:52.044 --> 04:53.213
Falla.

04:53.246 --> 04:55.217
You know what
they say about you?

04:55.250 --> 04:56.219
Yes, I do.

05:18.330 --> 05:20.834
He said,
"The only thing more nauseating

05:20.867 --> 05:22.037
than my romantic clichés

05:22.071 --> 05:24.108
was my two dimensional heroine."

05:24.141 --> 05:25.844
He hated it.

05:25.877 --> 05:27.348
I'm sure he didn't hate it.

05:27.382 --> 05:28.551
He hated it.

05:28.584 --> 05:30.354
Oh, yeah.

05:30.388 --> 05:31.823
I finished it this morning.

05:31.856 --> 05:33.860
I feel both empowered
and helpless now.

05:34.596 --> 05:36.533
Try being Italian.

05:44.081 --> 05:45.083
Tom!

05:46.420 --> 05:48.256
- What are you doing here?
- Hey, babe.

05:48.290 --> 05:50.093
I'm taking you to lunch.

05:50.127 --> 05:51.362
Hey, Emma.

05:51.397 --> 05:54.835
So, just got these printed.

05:54.869 --> 05:57.908
One for you, a couple for you.

05:57.941 --> 05:59.980
Tom Bell Entertainment.

06:00.013 --> 06:01.316
It's very professional.

06:01.349 --> 06:02.986
It is professional, isn't it?

06:04.188 --> 06:07.227
If my Nonno saw me
eating with these chopsticks,

06:07.261 --> 06:08.431
she'd have kittens.

06:08.464 --> 06:10.535
Ah, <i>bravo.</i>

06:10.568 --> 06:11.403
Thank you.

06:19.653 --> 06:20.621
Got you something.

06:21.623 --> 06:24.128
- What's that?
- It's not a ring, don't worry.

06:28.970 --> 06:30.475
Tom, it's beautiful.

06:31.510 --> 06:32.911
- But...
- You don't like it?

06:32.945 --> 06:34.115
No, I love it.

06:35.183 --> 06:37.187
It's too expensive,
you can't afford it.

06:37.221 --> 06:38.524
Shh, it's too late.

06:38.557 --> 06:40.961
I already got it
engraved anyways.

06:40.994 --> 06:43.099
Came in to a bit
of money recently,

06:43.133 --> 06:44.469
and I wanted
to get you something.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.511
Wow, that's very nice.

06:48.544 --> 06:49.646
Thanks.

06:52.251 --> 06:53.319
You like it?

07:00.401 --> 07:01.703
Do you have to go?

07:01.737 --> 07:04.443
I'm working in the shop
this afternoon.

07:04.476 --> 07:05.378
I can take you.

07:09.386 --> 07:11.523
Or I can just drop you off
on the corner, it's fine.

07:12.659 --> 07:14.696
I want you to meet them, Tom,
it's just...

07:15.665 --> 07:16.999
It's just what?

07:17.033 --> 07:18.671
Complicated at the moment.

07:27.655 --> 07:29.693
Robert's going to love these.

07:29.726 --> 07:32.164
- You must be counting the hours now.
- Mhm.

07:33.801 --> 07:35.705
- Angela.
- Hi, <i>comare.</i>

07:37.274 --> 07:39.078
Hi, everyone. Hi, Francesca.

07:39.111 --> 07:41.450
- Hey, Angela.
- Angela, Robert's coming home.

07:42.351 --> 07:43.821
Oh, that's good.

07:43.854 --> 07:45.357
Yeah, we're having a little

07:45.391 --> 07:46.693
welcome home party
for him on Sunday.

07:46.727 --> 07:47.662
You have to come.

07:49.566 --> 07:50.635
I have a lot of studying.

07:50.668 --> 07:51.637
Of course she'll come.

07:52.505 --> 07:54.576
- Huh?
- He'll be so happy to see you.

08:00.253 --> 08:02.692
She gets more
beautiful every day.

08:02.725 --> 08:04.462
Mhm.

08:06.198 --> 08:07.535
Promised?

08:07.569 --> 08:08.804
What does that even mean?

08:09.839 --> 08:11.877
It's like an arranged
marriage sort of thing.

08:11.910 --> 08:13.714
I thought they only
did that in India.

08:14.649 --> 08:15.785
My dad is so old-fashioned.

08:16.687 --> 08:19.224
Does Tom know
about your fiancée?

08:20.327 --> 08:22.498
I've never really
taken it seriously.

08:22.532 --> 08:23.601
I'm guessing that's a no.

08:24.803 --> 08:26.406
Tom doesn't know about Robert,

08:26.440 --> 08:29.211
and my parents
don't know about Tom.

08:29.244 --> 08:30.881
I'm Italian. The boy you bring

08:30.915 --> 08:32.485
to the door
is the boy you marry.

08:33.486 --> 08:34.456
What's he like?

08:35.424 --> 08:36.559
- Robert?
- Yeah.

08:39.432 --> 08:40.568
I don't really know.

08:41.703 --> 08:43.506
He's five years older than me.

08:43.539 --> 08:48.282
Sort of witty but distant
all at the same time.

08:48.316 --> 08:49.351
You like him.

08:50.353 --> 08:52.692
I had a serious
schoolgirl crush on him.

08:54.596 --> 08:56.767
Angela. Darling,
why don't you go and say

08:56.800 --> 08:58.804
goodbye to Robert
before he goes?

08:58.837 --> 09:00.675
Mom.

09:00.708 --> 09:02.845
Go, darling, go.

09:14.402 --> 09:15.838
Angela, hey.

09:17.274 --> 09:18.377
You look really nice.

09:18.410 --> 09:20.313
Thanks, Robert.

09:24.756 --> 09:26.460
You must be excited
about Oxford.

09:27.495 --> 09:29.799
If by excited,
you mean totally terrified,

09:29.833 --> 09:32.370
then, then, yeah.

09:32.405 --> 09:35.511
I haven't even made
my own bed before.

09:39.486 --> 09:41.021
I want to go to uni too one day.

09:42.492 --> 09:43.660
Then you should.

09:43.694 --> 09:44.963
Yeah, my dad wants me to work

09:44.996 --> 09:45.965
in the shop.

09:45.998 --> 09:48.504
Oh, I'm sure he won't stop you.

09:48.537 --> 09:50.741
Your dad,
he got me a real cool pen set.

09:50.775 --> 09:52.612
- Really?
- Yeah, for uni.

09:52.645 --> 09:53.680
It's, it's really nice.

09:57.588 --> 09:59.392
Why don't you
ask her to dance?

10:00.461 --> 10:01.563
She's just a kid, Dad.

10:29.586 --> 10:31.690
He was never into me.

10:31.723 --> 10:33.961
And his sister tells me he has
a girlfriend in England, so.

10:35.598 --> 10:37.435
Your life is so complicated.

10:38.704 --> 10:39.772
Tell me about it.

11:16.980 --> 11:18.984
You've got visitors?

11:19.017 --> 11:21.221
Just some family
and friend, Rob.

11:21.255 --> 11:22.458
And <i>compare?</i>

11:23.560 --> 11:24.529
Wait until you see Angela.

11:33.647 --> 11:35.985
Oh, Aunt Sia.
I didn't see you before.

11:38.991 --> 11:40.995
Roberto, you're too skinny.

11:43.600 --> 11:44.936
Of course.

11:44.969 --> 11:45.904
Whatever you need.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.042
What could
this man possibly need?

11:48.075 --> 11:49.277
Ah, Falla!

11:50.714 --> 11:51.850
Welcome home, Robert.

11:51.883 --> 11:53.653
Thank you, thank you.

11:53.687 --> 11:55.991
Hey, excuse me!

11:56.025 --> 11:57.328
- Bruno!
- Hi, Robert.

11:57.361 --> 11:59.131
You're a teenager,
what's going on?

11:59.164 --> 12:00.299
Hey,
is your sister here as well?

12:00.334 --> 12:01.936
She had to study.

12:01.970 --> 12:03.840
- But she'll be here.
- Yeah, cool.

12:05.978 --> 12:07.581
I'll, I'll be right back, okay?

12:11.990 --> 12:13.225
Okay.

12:13.259 --> 12:14.695
Hey.

12:14.729 --> 12:16.098
Look at you.

12:16.131 --> 12:17.368
Huh?

12:17.402 --> 12:18.970
He's a man now, he's a man.

12:19.004 --> 12:20.974
- I don't know about that.
- Are you back for good?

12:21.008 --> 12:22.778
Yeah. You think Maria

12:22.812 --> 12:24.281
would let him leave again?

12:24.314 --> 12:25.651
Yeah, I think so.

12:25.684 --> 12:26.653
It's good to be home.

12:30.226 --> 12:31.261
Three keys?

12:32.965 --> 12:34.669
One is for the car.

12:34.702 --> 12:35.804
One is for the office.

12:36.840 --> 12:38.242
And the third one is...

12:41.148 --> 12:42.283
A surprise?

12:43.854 --> 12:45.757
Uh, thank you.

12:49.097 --> 12:51.034
Some kind of surprise.

12:51.068 --> 12:53.172
What,
someone's chastity belt?

12:53.205 --> 12:54.409
Roberto.

12:56.145 --> 12:57.781
I want that key.

12:57.815 --> 12:59.251
You remember Diana, don't you?

13:02.090 --> 13:03.058
Hi.

13:04.060 --> 13:07.267
Yeah, but I don't think
I've seen you since...

13:07.300 --> 13:10.774
I think it was, um,
at my confirmation.

13:10.807 --> 13:12.445
Yeah, that's it, I think.

13:12.479 --> 13:14.882
She's going to be
your secretary.

13:14.916 --> 13:16.487
- My secretary?
- Mhm.

13:16.520 --> 13:17.988
Oh, you don't have
to give me the job.

13:18.022 --> 13:19.992
No, no, no, uh,
that's okay, I just...

13:20.026 --> 13:22.297
She's already set up
the office, Roberto.

13:22.330 --> 13:23.400
Done a great job too.

13:24.936 --> 13:26.205
Well, uh, thank you.

13:26.238 --> 13:27.409
Hi.

13:27.442 --> 13:29.946
Um, I'm Jeff,
Robert's best mate.

13:29.979 --> 13:31.816
And successful
sports journalist.

13:32.985 --> 13:35.089
Diana just moved in
from the country.

13:35.122 --> 13:36.392
Her father and I go
back a long way.

13:36.427 --> 13:38.763
I'd be happy to show you
around if you want.

13:39.899 --> 13:41.001
Someone ball?

13:43.940 --> 13:45.877
- Let's go back in.
- Lovely to see you again.

13:50.420 --> 13:52.257
Oh my.

13:54.094 --> 13:55.531
What's wrong?

13:55.565 --> 13:56.432
Nothing.

13:58.837 --> 14:00.440
It's just this welcome
home barbecue.

14:00.475 --> 14:02.243
The one I'm not invited to?

14:02.277 --> 14:03.980
Yeah.

14:04.014 --> 14:06.886
This boy Robert, he... well...

14:06.919 --> 14:07.988
He's what?

14:09.090 --> 14:11.863
His father and my father
have this stupid expectation

14:11.896 --> 14:12.998
that we're going to get married.

14:13.032 --> 14:15.036
It's not funny.

14:16.939 --> 14:18.943
But no one can convince
you to marry anyone

14:18.977 --> 14:20.414
you don't want to.

14:20.447 --> 14:22.350
They just don't do that anymore.

14:22.384 --> 14:23.820
You don't know my father.

14:24.656 --> 14:27.160
And he feels indebted
to Robert's dad.

14:32.337 --> 14:33.541
My dad was on a delivery.

14:36.580 --> 14:37.881
Papa!

14:39.553 --> 14:42.424
- Oh, my God, oh, my God.
- She's having a baby!

14:42.458 --> 14:43.494
- I'll get the car.
- It's okay.

14:43.527 --> 14:45.129
- Just stay here.
- Okay.

14:45.162 --> 14:47.033
Shh, shh.

14:47.066 --> 14:49.304
It's okay, breathe, breathe,
breathe.

14:49.337 --> 14:51.141
It's okay, shh.

14:51.174 --> 14:53.446
He was the one that
drove my mom to the hospital,

14:53.480 --> 14:55.349
and I was born just in time.

14:56.318 --> 15:00.092
And Robert's dad
isn't just my godfather.

15:00.126 --> 15:01.361
What does that mean?

15:02.699 --> 15:04.033
He's connected.

15:16.660 --> 15:17.729
You're out!

15:17.762 --> 15:19.264
Hey, grab that.

15:29.017 --> 15:30.319
Angela, hey.

15:30.352 --> 15:31.188
Hi.

15:32.391 --> 15:33.627
Hey, Angie,
look what Robert

15:33.661 --> 15:35.362
brought me back, isn't it grass?

15:35.397 --> 15:37.468
Look, he's bought us all
some beautiful gifts.

15:37.501 --> 15:38.436
Have a look.

15:38.470 --> 15:39.505
I've got a grandfather watch.

15:39.538 --> 15:40.608
It's called a fog watch.

15:40.641 --> 15:42.210
Francesca.

15:42.243 --> 15:44.649
Well, looks like
a grandfather watch to me.

15:44.683 --> 15:47.589
All we need now is
some grandchildren.

15:47.622 --> 15:48.490
Right, Sal?

15:53.131 --> 15:56.071
I actually got you
a gift as well.

15:56.104 --> 15:57.675
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

15:59.411 --> 16:01.750
Why don't you two go out,
get some fresh air?

16:02.752 --> 16:03.621
Yeah.

16:12.605 --> 16:14.475
Our families, huh?

16:14.508 --> 16:16.379
The subtlety of an atomic bomb.

16:16.412 --> 16:20.152
I know,
this whole promise thing.

16:20.185 --> 16:22.290
It's just so silly and awkward.

16:22.323 --> 16:24.193
- It is definitely awkward.
- Hm.

16:25.497 --> 16:26.800
You know, not so long ago,
arranged marriages

16:26.833 --> 16:27.802
were common in our community,

16:27.835 --> 16:29.639
they even had a word for it.

16:29.673 --> 16:31.610
Look, we're both educated,
Robert.

16:31.643 --> 16:34.616
Yes. Oh, um,

16:34.649 --> 16:36.217
English Literature
at Melbourne Uni.

16:36.251 --> 16:37.822
That's, that's really great.

16:37.855 --> 16:39.525
Thank you.

16:39.558 --> 16:40.493
Done all right yourself?

16:43.332 --> 16:46.271
No, I never, uh,
never doubted you'd get there.

16:53.352 --> 16:56.727
My Nonno used to plant
tomatoes in this very spot.

16:59.230 --> 17:01.201
It's where I started out.

17:01.234 --> 17:02.672
Now I grow my own,
my own family.

17:05.209 --> 17:06.277
I'm seeing someone.

17:07.547 --> 17:09.150
- Really?
- Mhm.

17:10.487 --> 17:13.526
Uh, right, uh, congratulations.

17:13.559 --> 17:15.362
My father doesn't
know though, so.

17:22.276 --> 17:24.347
- I should go see if they need any help in the kitchen.
- Yeah.

17:24.381 --> 17:25.885
I mean,
you know what they are like.

17:26.887 --> 17:28.724
I'll be in in a minute.

17:28.757 --> 17:29.625
Okay.

17:36.807 --> 17:38.944
And this is the bit
I don't like.

17:51.367 --> 17:52.772
Ah, it's fine.

17:52.805 --> 17:53.741
Tell her, Angela.

17:53.774 --> 17:55.678
Gianna's moved in down the road.

17:55.711 --> 17:57.514
Yeah, Mom told me.

17:57.547 --> 17:58.951
I haven't seen you since...

18:00.453 --> 18:01.321
well,

18:03.358 --> 18:04.729
Oh, don't worry.

18:09.571 --> 18:11.743
Hey, Angie,
don't forget your present.

18:24.067 --> 18:25.871
An old book?

18:25.905 --> 18:29.779
No, it's...
it's a first edition.

18:29.813 --> 18:30.714
I should thank him.

18:35.089 --> 18:37.460
A list of all
your appointments.

18:37.494 --> 18:38.764
Ah, right.

18:44.408 --> 18:47.714
Italian, Italian and Italian.

18:47.748 --> 18:49.685
Your father organized
most of them.

18:49.718 --> 18:51.756
- Well, I guess I'll see you at work.
- Yeah.

18:54.428 --> 18:56.031
It's good, child,
it's good, what.

18:56.065 --> 18:57.500
- You happy?
- No, I'm happy but...

18:57.534 --> 18:59.037
Dad?

18:59.071 --> 19:00.006
Can we go now?

19:01.475 --> 19:02.444
So early?

19:02.477 --> 19:03.747
I have to study, <i>compare.</i>

19:04.883 --> 19:06.085
Did you have a good
chat to Robert?

19:07.087 --> 19:07.955
Yeah.

19:10.593 --> 19:11.562
We'll stay a little longer.

19:16.505 --> 19:18.476
Your father made it
specially for Roberto.

19:19.244 --> 19:20.113
We cut the cake.

19:42.223 --> 19:43.492
Come to bed.

19:45.931 --> 19:47.000
What's wrong with her?

19:47.969 --> 19:49.504
She's stressed with her studies,
that's all.

19:49.538 --> 19:51.575
Well, she wanted to go
to university.

19:54.081 --> 19:56.118
I think she's seeing someone.

19:56.151 --> 19:57.520
A boyfriend?

19:57.554 --> 19:58.222
Who?

19:59.091 --> 20:00.861
I don't know,
I just saw something.

20:00.894 --> 20:02.063
Well, he's wrong for her.

20:03.165 --> 20:05.670
- You don't know him.
- What do I need to know him for?

20:10.213 --> 20:12.217
You were wrong for me once,
remember?

20:13.152 --> 20:14.956
Do you honestly think
my father was happy

20:14.989 --> 20:17.093
about me marrying a Sicilian?

20:17.127 --> 20:19.798
I made a promise to <i>Compare</i> Joe.

20:19.832 --> 20:21.735
- We owe him.
- The world's totally

20:21.769 --> 20:23.739
changed, Sal.

20:23.773 --> 20:25.944
Joe and Maria
would understand it.

20:25.978 --> 20:27.614
Robert's not like our daughter.

20:27.647 --> 20:28.749
He listens to his parents.

20:31.923 --> 20:32.958
Let's go to bed.

20:59.678 --> 21:00.881
Wait until you see inside.

21:02.717 --> 21:04.354
Oh, wow.

21:06.358 --> 21:07.794
Looks amazing, Dad.

21:09.097 --> 21:10.233
It's better than new.

21:12.370 --> 21:13.706
I've always liked this house.

21:14.976 --> 21:15.978
Well?

21:16.946 --> 21:17.847
It's yours.

21:19.818 --> 21:20.686
It's mine?

21:22.157 --> 21:23.927
Thought you and Mom
wanted me at home.

21:23.960 --> 21:26.331
Yes, but after the wedding.

21:30.039 --> 21:31.341
I don't think things
are going to work out

21:31.376 --> 21:32.310
the way you think, Dad.

21:34.347 --> 21:35.216
Why not?

21:38.924 --> 21:40.394
What happened
to my tomato patch?

21:41.762 --> 21:42.864
You don't have time for that.

21:49.478 --> 21:50.880
Marriage is once, Robert.

21:54.054 --> 21:55.189
Angela is the one for you.

22:06.011 --> 22:07.414
So, what's this one about then,
huh?

22:09.851 --> 22:11.522
It's about a girl.

22:11.556 --> 22:13.058
Who falls in love?

22:13.092 --> 22:14.127
Ow!

22:17.568 --> 22:19.337
What are you going to do
when I actually have my novel

22:19.371 --> 22:21.542
published and it becomes
an instant classic?

22:21.576 --> 22:24.147
I'm going to live off
your royalties, obviously.

22:24.180 --> 22:25.584
You're going to have to read it.

22:25.617 --> 22:28.355
No, I can just go see the film

22:28.390 --> 22:30.026
because it's going
to be that good.

22:37.541 --> 22:39.277
My parents know about us.

22:43.118 --> 22:44.287
Did you tell them?

22:44.321 --> 22:45.490
Not exactly.

22:46.958 --> 22:47.995
But they know,

22:48.997 --> 22:50.333
and we need to do
something before they do.

23:05.296 --> 23:06.432
- Angela, hi.
- Hi.

23:07.501 --> 23:08.369
Do you have a minute?

23:09.371 --> 23:11.108
Ah, do you have an appointment?

23:14.147 --> 23:16.184
I'm kidding. Of course,
come on in.

23:20.326 --> 23:22.029
Sorry, take a seat.

23:22.063 --> 23:22.930
Thank you.

23:24.300 --> 23:26.371
Welcome to the office
of Prima Partners.

23:27.373 --> 23:29.678
Need help getting out
of a parking ticket recently?

23:29.712 --> 23:32.049
No.

23:32.083 --> 23:35.189
I want you to do something
for me, for us.

23:36.626 --> 23:38.596
Yeah, of course, anything.

23:38.630 --> 23:41.034
I was hoping
you'd talk to your father

23:41.067 --> 23:42.236
and my father actually.

23:43.406 --> 23:46.646
Get this whole silly promise
thing out of their heads.

23:46.679 --> 23:48.115
This whole promise thing.

23:50.085 --> 23:51.622
I don't suppose your
boyfriend likes the idea

23:51.656 --> 23:54.026
of you being betrothed
to another man, huh?

23:54.060 --> 23:56.097
Actually,
he's been surprisingly...

23:57.401 --> 23:59.370
fine about the whole thing.

23:59.405 --> 24:01.174
He just started
his own business.

24:02.644 --> 24:04.515
Ah, cool.

24:06.452 --> 24:07.320
On his own.

24:10.059 --> 24:11.529
Well,
he sounds like a decent man.

24:11.562 --> 24:12.531
He is.

24:14.300 --> 24:16.238
Look, I'd talk to them myself,
but...

24:17.741 --> 24:19.478
well, you know our fathers.

24:19.512 --> 24:20.380
Yeah.

24:21.248 --> 24:24.153
Besides,
I hear you're a great lawyer.

24:24.187 --> 24:26.392
You should be good at getting
out of those contracts.

24:29.130 --> 24:31.268
You do want to get out of this,
don't you?

24:31.301 --> 24:33.406
You remember
my Nonno's old place?

24:33.439 --> 24:35.410
The one, uh, not far from here?

24:35.443 --> 24:36.311
Yeah.

24:38.115 --> 24:39.217
My dad gave it to us.

24:40.620 --> 24:42.290
What?

24:42.323 --> 24:43.526
Yeah,
you could say it's renovated.

24:43.560 --> 24:44.795
It's real modern and classy.

24:44.828 --> 24:46.264
- It looks really nice.
- I'm sorry,

24:46.298 --> 24:47.868
did you just say us?

24:47.901 --> 24:50.574
Did you say he gave us a house?

24:50.607 --> 24:52.477
For after we're married.

24:54.280 --> 24:55.550
People don't usually get married

24:55.584 --> 24:57.621
because they are given a house,
Robert.

24:57.654 --> 25:00.560
People usually get married
because they are in love.

25:03.900 --> 25:05.101
Look, Angela.

25:06.171 --> 25:07.441
Coffee, anyone?

25:08.376 --> 25:09.243
That's okay.

25:10.212 --> 25:11.181
I should go.

25:14.320 --> 25:15.322
Okay.

25:16.291 --> 25:17.360
So, you'll talk to them?

25:18.396 --> 25:19.398
Yeah, of course.

25:34.528 --> 25:36.264
Jeez, are you even chewing it?

25:36.297 --> 25:37.701
- Mhm.
- Leave him alone.

25:38.870 --> 25:40.874
He hasn't eaten probably
in five years.

25:41.842 --> 25:42.678
You know,

25:43.513 --> 25:44.715
a couple things I miss most,
I reckon

25:44.748 --> 25:45.950
your lasagna was right up there

25:45.984 --> 25:47.654
- apart from you.
- Mhm.

25:47.688 --> 25:49.290
I fell in love with your mother

25:49.323 --> 25:50.460
because of that lasagna.

25:54.835 --> 25:55.704
Did you see the house?

25:57.306 --> 25:59.411
If he doesn't like it,
I'll take it.

25:59.445 --> 26:00.814
You think Angela will like it?

26:03.486 --> 26:04.755
Talk about Angela.

26:04.788 --> 26:05.790
What about her?

26:08.295 --> 26:09.832
What if she doesn't
want to marry me?

26:11.034 --> 26:13.473
She'd be crazy to say no to you.

26:13.506 --> 26:14.408
Did you talk to her?

26:16.044 --> 26:17.614
But last time I checked,
marriage was between

26:17.647 --> 26:19.418
two consenting adults, Mom.

26:19.451 --> 26:20.820
Sal and Dad are adults,

26:20.854 --> 26:22.724
they consented, that's two.

26:22.758 --> 26:23.860
What's the problem?

26:30.740 --> 26:32.978
I just don't think I need
to rush things with Angela,

26:33.011 --> 26:33.913
that's all I'm saying.

26:33.946 --> 26:35.450
What rush?

26:35.483 --> 26:37.621
They made the promise
20 years ago.

26:37.654 --> 26:38.790
Yeah, she's got you there, Rob.

26:38.823 --> 26:40.058
And she's not even a lawyer.

26:41.094 --> 26:42.631
And just,
I don't even know her anymore.

26:42.664 --> 26:44.701
We need time to get
to know each other again.

26:44.735 --> 26:46.037
Why are you talking like this?

26:46.070 --> 26:47.641
We've known her
and her family all her life.

26:48.676 --> 26:49.611
What do you need to know?

26:52.149 --> 26:53.351
She has a boyfriend.

26:57.861 --> 26:58.763
Who?

27:00.967 --> 27:01.869
What's it matter?

27:22.477 --> 27:23.946
That horse is the closest thing

27:23.980 --> 27:25.850
they have to a saint
in this country.

27:27.454 --> 27:28.823
Thanks for coming.

27:28.856 --> 27:29.858
Take a seat, Tom.

27:42.817 --> 27:45.122
We've never met,
but I believe you know

27:45.155 --> 27:47.627
my goddaughter, Angela.

27:47.661 --> 27:48.529
Yes, I do.

27:50.132 --> 27:51.000
Do you know who I am?

27:51.936 --> 27:53.138
I've heard, yeah.

27:54.073 --> 27:55.944
And I can assure you
that my intentions

27:55.977 --> 27:57.847
for Angela are
completely honorable.

27:59.116 --> 28:00.586
And I'm going to ask her father

28:00.620 --> 28:02.724
for her hand in marriage.

28:03.693 --> 28:05.028
Marriage is a big commitment.

28:06.030 --> 28:08.769
Are you sure you're
in a position to get married?

28:08.803 --> 28:10.473
We'll make it work, yeah.

28:14.581 --> 28:15.883
I like your confidence.

28:17.252 --> 28:19.090
You ever bet on the races, Tom?

28:21.795 --> 28:24.166
I have a feeling
you're going to give me a tip.

28:24.200 --> 28:25.202
Think big in business,

28:26.605 --> 28:27.907
think small when gambling.

28:31.047 --> 28:33.719
But you don't think small,
do you, Tom?

28:33.753 --> 28:35.556
You want to get rich quick.

28:35.590 --> 28:36.892
Well, I want to get ahead.

28:38.329 --> 28:41.167
I've started my own
business actually.

28:41.200 --> 28:42.236
Um.

28:43.372 --> 28:44.708
Tom Bell Entertainment.

28:45.877 --> 28:47.680
Yes, I know.

28:49.250 --> 28:51.187
I also know you are...

28:51.220 --> 28:52.957
over ten grand in the red...

28:53.993 --> 28:55.095
with bookies.

28:56.665 --> 28:57.834
It's not nearly that much.

29:00.105 --> 29:02.076
It was just a bit of bad luck,
that's all.

29:03.413 --> 29:04.848
But I'm getting ahead now.

29:10.860 --> 29:11.728
What are you doing?

29:20.880 --> 29:21.949
Settle your debts...

29:23.051 --> 29:24.688
and get out of town for a while.

29:25.857 --> 29:27.694
Take a holiday
for a couple of months.

29:28.396 --> 29:30.098
I hear the Greek islands
are a good place

29:30.132 --> 29:31.768
for a young man
to clear his head.

29:33.706 --> 29:34.373
I can't be bought.

29:36.144 --> 29:37.012
Then tear it up.

29:38.483 --> 29:40.218
I love her.

29:40.252 --> 29:41.120
Then tear it up.

29:42.957 --> 29:44.360
What would happen
if I did tear it up?

29:46.364 --> 29:48.802
In my world,
debt needs to be repaid

29:49.771 --> 29:50.806
one way or the other.

30:00.494 --> 30:02.964
He's Italian, Tom.

30:02.997 --> 30:04.834
Oh, we know, we know.

30:04.868 --> 30:05.736
How?

30:06.939 --> 30:09.911
Your father's really
worried about you, you know?

30:09.945 --> 30:11.080
He doesn't need to be.

30:13.953 --> 30:14.988
Do you love him?

30:16.157 --> 30:17.025
Yes.

30:18.963 --> 30:21.167
Oh, this is going to break
your father's heart.

30:25.810 --> 30:27.112
We just want the best for you.

30:29.316 --> 30:30.318
That's all.

31:02.082 --> 31:03.017
Dino.

31:03.051 --> 31:04.153
Joe.

31:04.186 --> 31:05.524
I want you to organize a wedding

31:05.557 --> 31:06.892
for Robert and Angela.

31:06.925 --> 31:09.196
Did Robert propose?

31:09.229 --> 31:11.233
Four weeks, my anniversary.

31:11.267 --> 31:12.504
But we're booked.

31:12.538 --> 31:14.306
I'll take care of that.

31:14.340 --> 31:16.110
You take care
of everything else.

31:16.143 --> 31:17.413
But, Joe...

31:17.447 --> 31:18.415
The best of everything.

31:23.926 --> 31:25.896
<i>♪ I beg your pardon ♪</i>

31:27.332 --> 31:31.040
<i>♪ I never promised you
a rose garden ♪</i>

31:32.944 --> 31:34.046
Working?

31:35.449 --> 31:36.918
What did <i>Compare</i> Joe want?

31:36.952 --> 31:39.256
Well, he... had good news.

31:39.289 --> 31:41.093
There's been a cancellation
at the ballroom,

31:41.127 --> 31:43.331
and we can have
the wedding in four weeks.

31:45.268 --> 31:47.473
- What?
- He said it's a great honor

31:47.507 --> 31:49.276
for both our families,
what could I say?

31:52.182 --> 31:53.184
Was Robert there?

32:03.070 --> 32:05.409
What's the matter?

32:05.443 --> 32:09.183
- Hey!
- They told me I can't see you anymore.

32:09.216 --> 32:11.722
- Who?
- My parents.

32:11.756 --> 32:12.624
Hey.

32:15.429 --> 32:17.500
- It's okay.
- I don't know what to do, Tom.

32:24.046 --> 32:25.382
It's okay, baby.

32:25.416 --> 32:27.252
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay, let me help.

32:35.436 --> 32:36.303
What is it, Bruno?

32:37.172 --> 32:38.140
Why can't you just
go along with it?

32:39.645 --> 32:41.749
Is it because it's not how
it happens in those books?

32:45.154 --> 32:46.626
Don't you want me to be happy?

32:46.659 --> 32:47.628
Robert's cool.

32:49.296 --> 32:52.202
What kind of man lets
his parents choose his wife?

32:52.235 --> 32:54.206
He knows what he wants,
that's all.

32:55.341 --> 32:56.343
And what is that?

32:57.279 --> 32:59.249
A good Italian girl
from a good family.

33:00.251 --> 33:02.255
A girl who can cook,
take care of the kids,

33:02.289 --> 33:03.525
and you know,

33:03.559 --> 33:05.128
a girl who hasn't slept around.

33:05.864 --> 33:06.732
You told her that?

33:07.701 --> 33:08.836
She thinks you're being
forced to marry her

33:08.870 --> 33:09.805
to keep your parents happy.

33:11.541 --> 33:12.543
What do you think?

33:17.754 --> 33:19.858
- Bullseye.
- Nice one, mate.

33:32.550 --> 33:33.786
Hey.

33:33.820 --> 33:34.788
Come in.

33:43.405 --> 33:44.675
This room hasn't changed much.

33:51.722 --> 33:52.858
What are you working on?

33:52.891 --> 33:53.893
Nothing.

33:56.799 --> 33:58.200
A short story for uni.

34:00.406 --> 34:01.273
Cool.

34:05.950 --> 34:06.952
Can I read it?

34:11.393 --> 34:12.362
Yeah.

34:15.402 --> 34:16.438
- This?
- Mhm.

34:21.547 --> 34:22.918
No title.

34:22.951 --> 34:24.020
It's not finished.

34:41.054 --> 34:42.824
People will think
she's pregnant, Sal.

34:42.858 --> 34:45.462
Let them think
what they want.

34:45.496 --> 34:46.664
Yeah, but she's our daughter.

34:47.565 --> 34:49.437
She wants to marry for love.

34:49.469 --> 34:50.672
Like you and me did.

34:50.706 --> 34:52.308
Roberto, he loves her.

34:53.078 --> 34:54.547
Yeah, but she doesn't love him.

34:54.580 --> 34:55.850
Oh, she doesn't know
what she wants.

34:55.884 --> 34:57.620
She's young, Sal.

34:59.690 --> 35:01.060
Talk to <i>Compare</i> Joe.

35:02.563 --> 35:03.598
And say what to him?

35:04.600 --> 35:06.303
That his son's not good
enough for our daughter?

35:07.606 --> 35:08.976
She's my daughter too.

35:18.094 --> 35:21.401
So, I like it, it's nice.

35:21.434 --> 35:23.806
Nice, that's it?

35:23.840 --> 35:28.048
I, I mean it's, uh, it's
well written and everything.

35:28.081 --> 35:31.154
Just, I don't know,
it doesn't sound like you.

35:31.187 --> 35:33.425
And what exactly
do I sound like?

35:34.594 --> 35:37.399
I don't know,
just not like that, I guess.

35:37.433 --> 35:39.036
You were supposed
to talk to them.

35:40.807 --> 35:43.378
But you didn't have the guts
to stand up to them, did you?

35:45.549 --> 35:46.684
Maybe we could be happy.

35:46.718 --> 35:49.523
I can't make you happy, Robert.

35:49.557 --> 35:52.029
Marriage isn't some
business arrangement.

35:52.062 --> 35:53.164
I know, I know.

35:54.600 --> 35:55.904
Then why did you agree to it?

36:01.782 --> 36:04.020
Uncle Dino wants to see
both of you at the ballroom.

36:04.053 --> 36:05.990
He needs to go
over the wedding plans.

36:12.269 --> 36:15.142
Um, it's getting late, I should,
I should probably go.

36:27.032 --> 36:31.541
What would happen...
if I ran away, eloped?

36:31.574 --> 36:34.747
It'd be shame, embarrassment,

36:34.780 --> 36:36.751
especially for your parents.

36:36.784 --> 36:38.889
But these things
have happened before,

36:38.923 --> 36:40.525
and I guess life will go on.

36:42.696 --> 36:43.899
When could I come back home?

36:45.202 --> 36:47.039
Probably a few months.

36:47.072 --> 36:48.041
I'd let you know.

36:49.343 --> 36:50.245
Angela.

36:51.114 --> 36:53.651
You can rebel
against your parents,

36:53.685 --> 36:55.288
you can rebel against the world,

36:55.322 --> 36:57.192
but love will find a way.

36:59.196 --> 37:01.267
- Hey.
- Robert.

37:01.300 --> 37:02.904
- Sorry.
- Take a seat.

37:02.937 --> 37:04.140
Hey,
did I miss anything?

37:05.342 --> 37:07.312
No, well, we'll get started.

37:07.346 --> 37:09.316
- Okay.
- I thought we'd start off

37:09.350 --> 37:12.122
with a traditional antipasto.

37:12.156 --> 37:14.093
And then a pasta.

37:14.126 --> 37:16.030
- Lasagna.
- Ravioli.

37:16.064 --> 37:17.332
We'll alternate.

37:17.366 --> 37:19.737
I've been wanting to do that,
excellent.

37:22.009 --> 37:24.113
Uh, right, mains.

37:24.146 --> 37:25.682
Honestly, Uncle Dino,
whatever you think is best

37:25.715 --> 37:26.784
is totally fine with me.

37:27.653 --> 37:28.755
Uh...

37:29.824 --> 37:32.596
So, when was the last time
you two danced together?

37:35.368 --> 37:36.704
What about a practice?

37:53.472 --> 37:55.675
Uncle Dino just wants everything
to be perfect, doesn't he?

37:55.709 --> 37:58.148
Hm. Don't you?

37:58.181 --> 38:00.252
Ah, more of a Sicilian thing,
I think.

38:04.427 --> 38:05.963
I got so many memories
of this place.

38:07.400 --> 38:08.268
Yeah.

38:09.136 --> 38:10.872
Like when you refused
to dance with me

38:10.907 --> 38:12.209
because I was just a kid?

38:14.146 --> 38:16.250
Wow, you remember that?

38:16.284 --> 38:17.319
I do.

38:18.455 --> 38:20.025
- What about a Bombe Alaska?
- No.

38:26.304 --> 38:27.773
I was going away.

38:28.509 --> 38:31.147
Can you imagine what
everyone would have said?

38:31.180 --> 38:33.385
And you really were just a kid,
we both were.

38:35.188 --> 38:37.059
You still haven't
answered my question.

38:38.963 --> 38:40.198
Why are you doing this?

38:41.901 --> 38:44.240
I can understand them
wanting this, but you?

38:45.443 --> 38:47.179
Can you please
just give me a chance?

38:49.216 --> 38:53.024
Marriage is built on love,
not chance.

38:53.057 --> 38:54.461
She has a point, mate.

38:59.003 --> 39:00.171
She's perfect for me.

39:01.575 --> 39:02.944
She doesn't love you.

39:04.079 --> 39:05.282
It's complicated.

39:10.325 --> 39:11.995
Rob.

39:12.029 --> 39:14.133
You're a cool guy, a good guy,

39:14.166 --> 39:16.471
but if you force
this girl to marry you...

39:16.505 --> 39:18.274
- you're a real...
- Asshole.

39:20.278 --> 39:22.249
Angela, this is the 70s,

39:22.282 --> 39:24.587
and to be clear,
this is the 1970s,

39:24.621 --> 39:25.922
not the 1870s.

39:26.924 --> 39:27.826
Nobody can make you marry
against your will.

39:27.859 --> 39:29.897
- Oh, my God.
- My family's not like yours.

39:29.930 --> 39:31.000
Yeah,
but you still have choices.

39:31.033 --> 39:33.505
Yeah, choices with consequences.

39:33.539 --> 39:34.873
There has to be
something we can do

39:34.907 --> 39:36.310
to get out
of this stupid promise.

40:26.243 --> 40:28.515
We were supposed to meet, Tom.

40:30.185 --> 40:31.621
Don't freak, it's not that bad.

40:31.655 --> 40:34.059
Not that bad?
You have to get to a hospital!

40:36.063 --> 40:38.502
My godfather did this
to you, didn't he?

40:38.535 --> 40:39.704
There's no way out, Ange.

40:41.741 --> 40:42.677
I'm sorry.

41:04.821 --> 41:06.625
They really hurt him, Mom.

41:07.627 --> 41:09.631
It wasn't <i>Compare</i> Joe.

41:09.664 --> 41:11.267
He owed money to other people.

41:11.300 --> 41:12.637
They were gambling debts.

41:12.670 --> 41:14.641
Darling,
they were trying to protect you.

41:14.674 --> 41:17.145
You believe anything
they tell you!

41:17.178 --> 41:19.116
- Angela!
- They've won, Mom.

41:22.657 --> 41:24.326
What's going
to happen to him now?

41:25.863 --> 41:26.831
That's up to him.

41:28.535 --> 41:30.639
Do you mean it's up to me?

42:03.237 --> 42:05.509
Robert and Angela,
have you come here freely

42:05.542 --> 42:06.745
and without reservation

42:06.778 --> 42:09.517
to give yourself to each
other in marriage?

42:13.925 --> 42:16.363
I, Angela, take you Robert,

42:16.398 --> 42:18.669
as my lawful husband.

42:18.702 --> 42:20.606
To have and to hold,

42:20.639 --> 42:22.777
for better, for worse,

42:22.810 --> 42:24.246
for richer, for poorer,

42:25.248 --> 42:27.318
in sickness and in health,

42:27.352 --> 42:28.655
until death do us part.

42:30.626 --> 42:32.295
Angela, I give you this ring

42:32.328 --> 42:35.469
as a symbol of my love
and faithfulness.

42:36.838 --> 42:38.775
I pledge to you all that I am,

42:38.809 --> 42:41.548
and all I ever will be
as your husband.

42:44.052 --> 42:47.593
I promise to love
and respect and honor you.

43:31.013 --> 43:32.516
Champagne?

43:32.550 --> 43:33.451
No.

43:35.054 --> 43:35.923
Hey.

43:39.530 --> 43:41.701
We're husband and wife now.

43:41.734 --> 43:42.603
On paper.

43:45.475 --> 43:46.511
Angela.

43:47.913 --> 43:48.915
Angela.

43:52.021 --> 43:54.460
I'll never force you to do
anything you don't want to do.

44:47.165 --> 44:48.468
We have a plane to catch.

44:52.275 --> 44:53.979
Around the city of love, huh?

45:01.126 --> 45:02.629
Do you get drunk often?

45:08.775 --> 45:09.977
Only when I drink a lot.

45:10.011 --> 45:11.981
Oh, Angela, please, don't.

45:15.287 --> 45:16.591
Well, get ready then.

46:10.765 --> 46:12.736
I think I'm supposed
to carry you over there.

46:23.257 --> 46:24.660
I've got that.

46:26.931 --> 46:27.833
Thanks.

46:51.415 --> 46:52.983
The counsel's just saying that

46:53.016 --> 46:54.185
you've got too many chickens.

46:56.089 --> 46:58.394
No, two or three?

46:59.396 --> 47:00.865
A dozen, a dozen.

47:00.899 --> 47:02.068
Free country!

47:04.406 --> 47:05.476
I'll write to them, okay?

47:08.213 --> 47:09.082
Oh.

47:10.284 --> 47:11.219
Thank you.

47:13.424 --> 47:15.327
Our best to your father, eh?

47:15.361 --> 47:16.229
Of course.

47:33.096 --> 47:35.402
- These are nice.
- I made them last night.

47:37.439 --> 47:38.475
Why don't you bring them in?

47:46.424 --> 47:48.126
How come your wife never goes?

47:51.501 --> 47:53.572
Uh, she's busy with studies, eh.

48:24.967 --> 48:26.538
You're not responsible
for your nephew's debts,

48:26.571 --> 48:27.973
Mr. Bellucci.

48:28.006 --> 48:28.975
I want to help him.

48:29.910 --> 48:32.482
Well, if he doesn't
pay within 14 days,

48:32.517 --> 48:34.587
they'll bankrupt him
and after interest,

48:34.621 --> 48:37.057
he owes just
under 20,000 dollars.

48:37.091 --> 48:39.328
You can buy a house
with that money.

48:39.362 --> 48:40.699
He's had some bad luck.

48:42.001 --> 48:44.607
We could not have children.

48:44.641 --> 48:46.342
All we have is this one nephew.

48:48.514 --> 48:49.717
like my husband,

48:50.786 --> 48:53.356
See if he goes bankrupt,
he has no future.

48:53.391 --> 48:54.761
We have some savings.

48:54.794 --> 48:57.999
If we could manage
to settle his debts with that.

48:58.033 --> 48:59.235
His debt's unsecured.
There's a very

48:59.268 --> 49:00.606
good chance that I can

49:00.639 --> 49:03.009
settle for half, anyway.

49:03.043 --> 49:03.679
Do your best.

49:04.681 --> 49:05.583
Um.

49:06.585 --> 49:08.789
One more thing.
What business is Tommasino in?

49:08.822 --> 49:10.357
The music business.

49:14.332 --> 49:16.169
He's young, do you understand?

49:18.709 --> 49:19.577
Thank you.

49:23.149 --> 49:25.087
Uh, when he gets back,
tell Tommasino

49:25.120 --> 49:27.124
- to come and see me, okay?
- Okay.

50:01.326 --> 50:02.697
Ah,
you're not in your room.

50:13.652 --> 50:15.656
Not working on a cookbook,
are we?

50:15.689 --> 50:16.658
I can't cook.

50:17.660 --> 50:18.662
You want to help me?

50:21.768 --> 50:23.236
Sure.

50:23.269 --> 50:24.171
Yeah.

50:31.855 --> 50:33.659
That's quite enough garlic,
that's good.

50:35.227 --> 50:36.698
I'm not going to be kissing you,
aren't I?

50:38.233 --> 50:39.704
Or anyone else for that matter.

50:44.345 --> 50:45.381
Voila.

50:46.851 --> 50:48.353
Who taught you how to cook?

50:49.288 --> 50:51.493
I lived on my own
for five years, so.

50:52.629 --> 50:54.399
"There's no virtue
like necessity."

50:55.367 --> 50:56.403
Shakespeare.

50:57.740 --> 50:59.777
A good wife maketh lasagna.

50:59.811 --> 51:00.979
My old man.

51:06.056 --> 51:07.893
I like cooking.
I was thinking one day I might

51:08.862 --> 51:10.866
open a restaurant or something.

51:10.899 --> 51:12.737
What about your practice?

51:12.770 --> 51:14.371
I like what I do but I,

51:14.406 --> 51:15.541
I don't know, this would be a...

51:15.575 --> 51:17.344
side business or something.

51:17.378 --> 51:19.516
Side business is
a family trait then?

51:22.455 --> 51:23.859
Well, we've got good partners

51:23.892 --> 51:25.360
like your Uncle Dino.

51:27.532 --> 51:29.569
He's the only one that never
gave me money as gifts.

51:29.603 --> 51:30.706
Only books.

51:30.739 --> 51:31.908
Yeah, me too.

51:32.877 --> 51:33.912
He's different.

51:33.945 --> 51:34.747
No woman, though.

51:36.349 --> 51:37.685
He's just waiting
for the right one.

51:41.393 --> 51:42.294
Try this.

51:49.911 --> 51:51.547
- Good?
- But good, yeah.

51:56.891 --> 51:57.993
Pass me that.

52:02.435 --> 52:03.604
What do you expect from me?

52:04.974 --> 52:06.410
What do you mean?

52:06.443 --> 52:08.380
None of this is real.

52:08.414 --> 52:10.451
It's all been arranged for us.

52:10.484 --> 52:12.823
It doesn't matter
how we got together.

52:12.857 --> 52:13.925
Can't you see that?

52:15.963 --> 52:17.098
Are you expecting someone?

52:24.079 --> 52:26.483
- How are you?
- Good, come on in, hey.

52:28.120 --> 52:29.991
- I thought I'd surprise you.
- Yeah.

52:31.526 --> 52:33.731
Ah, cool!

52:33.765 --> 52:34.699
Tony!

52:35.635 --> 52:37.138
- Hey, Angela.
- He had his first single.

52:37.171 --> 52:38.741
Oh, wow.

52:38.775 --> 52:40.745
Proud of you, man,
that's awesome.

52:44.887 --> 52:47.492
Thank you, Angela,
it was lovely.

52:47.525 --> 52:48.627
It's a collaboration.

52:49.729 --> 52:51.199
- That's a good word for it.
- It's fresh eggs, Tony,

52:51.233 --> 52:52.235
the secret.

52:56.844 --> 52:58.747
I'll go and get the coffee.

52:58.782 --> 52:59.784
I'll give you a hand.

52:59.817 --> 53:00.953
No, I've got it.

53:06.596 --> 53:09.536
Hey, do people ever talk
about Angela and I?

53:13.812 --> 53:16.249
So, anyway, I've, uh, got
a little bit of news for you.

53:16.283 --> 53:17.251
Mhm.

53:17.285 --> 53:18.554
So, yesterday I went down

53:18.587 --> 53:20.091
to the ballroom
for a house show.

53:20.124 --> 53:21.660
And I got there
early and I spied

53:21.693 --> 53:23.197
Dino and Gianna
dancing together.

53:24.632 --> 53:25.501
Really?

53:26.471 --> 53:27.538
They were on
their own in the dark

53:27.572 --> 53:28.540
without music.

53:28.574 --> 53:30.611
There was no one around.

53:30.644 --> 53:31.948
She wasn't wearing black and,

53:31.981 --> 53:33.550
yeah,
he wasn't wearing a bowtie.

53:33.584 --> 53:34.586
Cool.

53:34.619 --> 53:35.588
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

53:35.621 --> 53:37.291
- Angela will be thrilled.
- Yeah, well, just

53:37.325 --> 53:38.794
keep hush about it
because I don't believe

53:38.828 --> 53:41.800
it's public yet,
so...

53:43.203 --> 53:45.708
Yeah, anyway,
how's the honeymoon?

53:47.211 --> 53:49.816
Yeah, no, it's, uh, it's good.
Rome was great.

53:52.221 --> 53:53.791
I'm not talking about Italy.

53:53.824 --> 53:55.027
I was talking
about <i>the</i> honeymoon.

53:56.830 --> 53:58.333
Uh.

53:58.367 --> 53:59.736
It was magical.

54:05.314 --> 54:07.351
You know, I've always wondered
what's in one of these things.

54:07.386 --> 54:09.022
Oh, it's just the glory box.

54:10.024 --> 54:12.628
You have to wait for your
wedding night to find out.

54:12.662 --> 54:14.199
Not very funny, Robert.

54:16.203 --> 54:17.238
Thank you, Angela.

55:12.416 --> 55:14.252
Your secretary, Diana.

55:15.922 --> 55:17.191
Yeah, what about her?

55:17.225 --> 55:18.293
Mate, I'm smitten.

55:20.498 --> 55:22.268
She is not a family
you want to mess with.

55:22.301 --> 55:24.038
I can't get her out of my head.

55:26.876 --> 55:27.980
Whenever I talk
to her the subject

55:28.013 --> 55:29.082
always comes back to you.

55:31.186 --> 55:33.257
Oh, she's just an impressionable
girl from the country,

55:33.290 --> 55:34.125
what can I say?

56:23.691 --> 56:25.628
We're going to back
the filly next.

56:26.564 --> 56:29.102
Nah, no chance
against the colts?

56:29.135 --> 56:30.672
Yeah, but she's well-bred.
I think she might

56:30.705 --> 56:32.108
improve over the distance.

56:34.380 --> 56:35.280
You all right, mate?

56:43.230 --> 56:45.300
Look, I always knew I wanted
to be a lawyer, right?

56:47.606 --> 56:49.007
My dad told me, when you...

56:50.244 --> 56:51.514
you're going to be a lawyer
before I even started school.

56:53.584 --> 56:55.087
That I would I have
my own practice,

56:55.120 --> 56:57.224
that I would have a nice house,

56:57.258 --> 56:59.095
and that one day my wife
would be Angela.

56:59.996 --> 57:01.700
Is that what you wanted?

57:01.734 --> 57:03.236
Always been what I wanted.

57:06.377 --> 57:07.978
She's not happy, Jeff.

57:08.012 --> 57:09.416
Mate, what did you expect?

57:10.385 --> 57:11.387
I didn't expect us
to be sleeping

57:11.420 --> 57:13.123
in different bedrooms.

57:13.156 --> 57:14.992
Yeah,
that's not supposed to happen

57:15.026 --> 57:16.630
in the first year of marriage.

57:16.664 --> 57:19.168
She's still reaching
out to him, Tom.

57:19.202 --> 57:20.738
- How do you know?
- I know.

57:23.411 --> 57:25.515
I already thought I'd win her
over by now, seriously, I did.

57:25.548 --> 57:27.084
Have you told her
how you feel about her?

57:27.117 --> 57:28.253
It's not that easy
to talk to her.

57:28.286 --> 57:31.092
Then spell it out to her,

57:31.125 --> 57:32.361
how you feel about her.

57:36.069 --> 57:38.240
What if she doesn't come around?

57:38.273 --> 57:40.411
You're the lawyer.

57:44.620 --> 57:46.757
Did you even propose?

57:49.463 --> 57:51.366
No, he didn't.

57:51.400 --> 57:53.370
I guess his father
never told him to.

57:53.404 --> 57:54.606
There's more to him.

57:56.209 --> 57:57.812
Are you softening towards him?

57:59.583 --> 58:00.685
I can't fault him.

58:01.754 --> 58:03.189
But there's something else.

58:04.560 --> 58:06.530
I found out
about Tom by accident.

58:07.499 --> 58:08.366
Tom?

58:09.168 --> 58:10.838
- How?
- One minute he has money.

58:10.872 --> 58:13.411
Next minute nothing,
he's completely broke,

58:13.444 --> 58:15.815
and I don't think
he lost it in business.

58:15.848 --> 58:16.817
Gambling?

58:19.423 --> 58:21.259
My mom told me
it wasn't my godfather

58:21.292 --> 58:23.831
who assaulted him, and I think
she was telling the truth.

58:24.800 --> 58:27.137
I trusted him, Em!

58:27.171 --> 58:28.808
I only married Robert
to protect him.

58:28.841 --> 58:29.776
Am I that naive?

58:29.810 --> 58:32.147
You were in love, and...

58:32.181 --> 58:33.551
love dumbs people down.

58:33.584 --> 58:35.388
You can quote me on that one.

58:35.421 --> 58:36.724
You know what
my mother calls me?

58:38.761 --> 58:40.431
What does that mean?

58:40.465 --> 58:41.567
Stubborn.

58:41.600 --> 58:42.469
Funny that.

58:45.675 --> 58:46.810
Supposed to be easy.

58:48.514 --> 58:51.252
You meet, you fall in love,

58:51.285 --> 58:52.756
and you get married
in that order.

58:52.789 --> 58:54.926
Maybe you should start dating.

58:54.960 --> 58:57.231
I've already made enough
mistakes to last me a lifetime.

58:57.264 --> 58:58.299
Not going to make another one.

58:58.333 --> 59:00.772
Not other people, your husband.

59:00.805 --> 59:02.442
See, when normal people meet,

59:02.475 --> 59:05.280
they go out on dates,
and they get to know each other.

59:06.249 --> 59:07.819
I don't know,
you did like him once.

59:09.690 --> 59:11.427
Tell you what.

59:11.460 --> 59:13.397
We can start tonight.

59:13.431 --> 59:15.768
But definitely not
in that dress.

59:15.802 --> 59:17.672
- I like it.
- It's disgusting.

59:21.547 --> 59:23.651
So, Robbie.

59:23.684 --> 59:26.022
Emma tells me that
you studied at Oxford.

59:26.055 --> 59:27.992
Yeah, I did, I did.

59:28.026 --> 59:30.465
Well, how was it over there?

59:30.498 --> 59:31.700
It was good. I,

59:31.734 --> 59:33.303
I worked in a law firm
in my final year

59:33.336 --> 59:35.708
on top of my studies
which was pretty tough.

59:35.742 --> 59:38.647
Uh, but I loved it over there,

59:38.681 --> 59:41.553
alone, much to my mom's
annoyance at me.

59:41.587 --> 59:42.589
She didn't want you to go?

59:43.557 --> 59:44.760
Oh, no, she, she did,
I just didn't think

59:44.793 --> 59:45.561
she thought I'd survive.

59:46.630 --> 59:49.636
Um, but it was too good
of an opportunity to miss.

59:50.538 --> 59:52.408
Pretty posh over there too,
I imagine.

59:53.109 --> 59:56.817
Personally, I prefer to keep,
uh, one foot on the ground.

59:56.850 --> 59:59.823
Then again I do pride myself
on being progressive.

01:00:00.925 --> 01:00:03.798
Still, it is good to go
out on one's own,

01:00:03.831 --> 01:00:04.699
is it not?

01:00:07.505 --> 01:00:08.373
How about you, Angela?

01:00:09.308 --> 01:00:11.413
Did you ever plan
to get out on your own?

01:00:11.446 --> 01:00:14.753
Ah, it's a little hard
for an Italian girl.

01:00:14.786 --> 01:00:15.655
Why?

01:00:16.757 --> 01:00:19.696
If we leave before we're
married it upsets everyone.

01:00:19.729 --> 01:00:21.433
It's hard to explain.

01:00:22.468 --> 01:00:25.675
So, you leave the safety
of one man's arms

01:00:25.708 --> 01:00:27.712
to go into the safety
of another's?

01:00:27.745 --> 01:00:30.585
No offense, Robbie.

01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:32.722
None taken.

01:00:38.199 --> 01:00:40.638
Don't you regret
not experiencing life

01:00:40.671 --> 01:00:42.909
more before you... settled?

01:00:44.512 --> 01:00:46.015
I don't think my life is over.

01:00:49.556 --> 01:00:50.958
How'd the two of you meet,
by the way?

01:00:53.096 --> 01:00:55.100
Uh, well, we've known each
other since we were kids.

01:00:56.603 --> 01:00:58.507
Childhood sweethearts.

01:00:58.540 --> 01:00:59.442
How charming.

01:00:59.476 --> 01:01:00.511
Not exactly. Uh, We were,

01:01:00.544 --> 01:01:02.749
an arranged marriage.

01:01:08.594 --> 01:01:09.529
You're not joking?

01:01:09.562 --> 01:01:10.631
No.

01:01:13.537 --> 01:01:14.606
Arranged by who?

01:01:15.541 --> 01:01:16.944
Our fathers.

01:01:18.046 --> 01:01:20.183
And you both just accepted that?

01:01:20.216 --> 01:01:23.958
Oh, well, if you ask me,
my father's a got perfect taste.

01:01:25.895 --> 01:01:27.230
You know,
change for the sake of change

01:01:27.264 --> 01:01:29.869
isn't necessarily progress, eh.

01:01:39.054 --> 01:01:40.056
Cheers.

01:01:43.062 --> 01:01:44.264
Cheers.

01:01:46.202 --> 01:01:48.574
Hey, thanks for playing along.

01:01:48.607 --> 01:01:49.676
He deserved it.

01:01:51.045 --> 01:01:53.751
So patronizing.

01:01:53.784 --> 01:01:57.190
Where did Emma find such
a testy dickhead?

01:01:57.224 --> 01:01:58.126
Uni.

01:01:58.994 --> 01:02:01.666
Let me guess,
he's studying politics.

01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:04.004
I don't know
what she sees in him.

01:02:05.173 --> 01:02:06.810
Love is mesmerizing.

01:02:06.843 --> 01:02:09.248
Mysterious and dumb.

01:02:11.318 --> 01:02:13.289
Hey, you want to get
something real to eat?

01:02:13.322 --> 01:02:14.692
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:02:14.726 --> 01:02:15.728
I do.

01:02:17.698 --> 01:02:19.803
How can you not
like <i>Gone with the Wind?</i>

01:02:19.836 --> 01:02:21.272
It's a classic.

01:02:21.305 --> 01:02:22.775
It's, uh, it's a masterpiece.

01:02:22.809 --> 01:02:24.612
What is there
to like about Scarlett?

01:02:25.347 --> 01:02:26.783
She's complex.

01:02:28.821 --> 01:02:30.090
I call that crazy, she's crazy.

01:02:31.292 --> 01:02:33.831
I suppose you prefer your women
obliging and subordinate.

01:02:33.864 --> 01:02:35.868
Ooh, the rest exist for that.

01:02:35.901 --> 01:02:37.705
Ah, thank you.

01:02:37.738 --> 01:02:39.676
Your table's been taken care of.

01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:43.149
Johnny Fresco.

01:02:45.153 --> 01:02:47.658
So, we don't like
the same books.

01:02:47.692 --> 01:02:49.194
Or films.

01:02:49.228 --> 01:02:50.898
Do we have anything in common?

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.438
Pizza.

01:02:53.471 --> 01:02:55.106
Half the world likes pizza.

01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:56.843
At least
you're in the right half.

01:02:57.812 --> 01:02:58.780
- Chili?
- Mm-hm.

01:02:59.883 --> 01:03:01.720
Yeah, that
significantly increases the odds

01:03:01.753 --> 01:03:02.456
to my favor.

01:03:02.489 --> 01:03:04.792
Marginally.

01:03:13.777 --> 01:03:15.915
That look,
it's like I'm a puzzle

01:03:15.948 --> 01:03:17.317
that needs to be solved.

01:03:18.454 --> 01:03:20.492
I just can't seem

01:03:20.525 --> 01:03:21.826
to like you back, that's all.

01:03:23.095 --> 01:03:24.799
You know, what we should do,
we should...

01:03:24.832 --> 01:03:26.836
ask each other
one question a day

01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:28.974
and commit to giving
an honest answer.

01:03:29.007 --> 01:03:30.412
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:03:31.414 --> 01:03:32.949
I'll go first.

01:03:32.982 --> 01:03:34.017
Okay.

01:03:35.788 --> 01:03:37.758
You're a good looking guy.

01:03:37.792 --> 01:03:38.894
Thank you.

01:03:38.927 --> 01:03:40.330
You're successful.

01:03:40.363 --> 01:03:41.967
Mm, don't know about that.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.336
It's only a one man practice.
I've been paid with

01:03:43.369 --> 01:03:44.772
too many chickens.

01:03:45.575 --> 01:03:47.479
You're charming when
you put your mind to it.

01:03:48.514 --> 01:03:50.518
I can see how girls,

01:03:50.552 --> 01:03:52.989
some girls might like you.

01:03:53.022 --> 01:03:54.892
Some girls, huh?

01:03:54.926 --> 01:03:56.396
- Not all girls?
- Mm-mm.

01:03:57.865 --> 01:03:58.800
So, why me?

01:03:59.902 --> 01:04:01.305
Was it just
to please your parents?

01:04:04.244 --> 01:04:07.317
Ah, well, that was part
of the reason, sure,

01:04:07.350 --> 01:04:09.187
but on... only a small part.

01:04:09.221 --> 01:04:10.858
And the other part?

01:04:10.891 --> 01:04:13.296
Were you looking for a project?

01:04:13.329 --> 01:04:15.333
What is there
not to like about you?

01:04:15.366 --> 01:04:18.440
Is that
the best you got?

01:04:19.643 --> 01:04:21.379
Well... it's actually,

01:04:21.413 --> 01:04:23.518
well, it's a question
that my father asked me.

01:04:25.253 --> 01:04:26.389
And?

01:04:27.458 --> 01:04:29.027
Well, truth be told,
I'm still thinking about it.

01:04:30.532 --> 01:04:32.167
I think about you a lot,
you know.

01:04:33.403 --> 01:04:35.206
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

01:04:36.544 --> 01:04:38.413
You know there are probably

01:04:38.447 --> 01:04:40.652
six people that I write
birthday cards to.

01:04:40.685 --> 01:04:43.122
Wow, flattering,
I'm one of the six.

01:04:43.155 --> 01:04:45.126
No, no,
you didn't let me finish.

01:04:45.159 --> 01:04:46.664
But your birthday
is the only one

01:04:46.697 --> 01:04:49.636
that I never needed to make
an effort to remember.

01:04:52.576 --> 01:04:55.012
And... you've got a nice smile.

01:04:55.046 --> 01:04:58.219
I could see how...
some men might,

01:04:58.252 --> 01:05:00.022
might find you attractive.

01:05:00.056 --> 01:05:01.325
Reverse psychology.

01:05:01.358 --> 01:05:04.097
- Working?
- No.

01:05:04.131 --> 01:05:05.602
I didn't realize
how persistent you are.

01:05:05.635 --> 01:05:07.070
I didn't realize
you were so stubborn.

01:05:07.103 --> 01:05:09.274
Mhm. Like an ox.

01:05:09.307 --> 01:05:10.309
Like a mule.

01:05:15.119 --> 01:05:16.557
What's your question?

01:05:16.590 --> 01:05:18.125
I don't know, okay.

01:05:19.227 --> 01:05:21.634
Let me think about it,
any one, huh?

01:05:21.667 --> 01:05:23.738
Okay, um.

01:05:23.771 --> 01:05:25.675
- What do you think?
- About what?

01:05:25.708 --> 01:05:28.012
About tonight, our first date?

01:05:31.151 --> 01:05:32.988
- Yeah?
- Mm.

01:05:33.022 --> 01:05:34.726
What do you think
about sex on the first date?

01:05:35.762 --> 01:05:37.632
You've had three questions.

01:05:37.666 --> 01:05:39.000
- Okay.
- I thought it was one.

01:05:40.136 --> 01:05:41.439
Fair enough.

01:06:56.422 --> 01:06:58.158
Mom.

01:06:58.192 --> 01:06:59.796
Buy something for the house.

01:07:01.331 --> 01:07:02.534
Thank you.

01:07:07.578 --> 01:07:08.914
Look, look, look, look.

01:07:11.654 --> 01:07:13.623
I found these in your bedroom.

01:07:13.658 --> 01:07:14.660
They are from Robert.

01:07:15.594 --> 01:07:18.734
You've kept them
all these years.

01:07:18.768 --> 01:07:19.635
Yeah.

01:07:22.608 --> 01:07:24.913
What happened with Tom, Mom?

01:07:25.915 --> 01:07:27.819
I know he isn't
who he says he is.

01:07:30.557 --> 01:07:32.862
Your father asked <i>Compare</i> Joe
to check him out.

01:07:33.798 --> 01:07:35.366
He had gambling debts.

01:07:37.004 --> 01:07:39.475
So, your godfather
gave him a check

01:07:39.508 --> 01:07:41.714
to cancel all those debts.

01:07:41.747 --> 01:07:43.984
But in exchange
for leaving you alone.

01:07:46.288 --> 01:07:48.225
And honey,
it was your father's money.

01:07:49.428 --> 01:07:51.532
He banked the check, didn't he?

01:07:51.566 --> 01:07:52.601
He did.

01:07:54.773 --> 01:07:57.879
And Uncle Pat was there
to keep an eye on things.

01:07:59.381 --> 01:08:01.284
And Robert went along with it
because Robert

01:08:01.318 --> 01:08:03.656
listens to his parents.

01:08:03.691 --> 01:08:04.592
Am I right?

01:08:05.427 --> 01:08:06.864
He does love you, you know,
Angela.

01:08:08.099 --> 01:08:09.770
He's not a silly boy, darling.

01:08:50.716 --> 01:08:51.586
Um.

01:08:52.554 --> 01:08:53.723
If you're going to be
professional writer,

01:08:53.756 --> 01:08:55.828
you can't work from the kitchen.

01:08:55.862 --> 01:08:57.832
It's beautiful, thank you.

01:08:57.866 --> 01:08:58.968
Chair.

01:09:00.170 --> 01:09:02.441
Uh, and here.

01:09:08.185 --> 01:09:10.423
You can put it on if you like.

01:09:10.457 --> 01:09:11.725
- Yeah?
- Mhm.

01:09:32.234 --> 01:09:33.904
How's it look?

01:09:33.938 --> 01:09:35.006
It's beautiful.

01:09:36.542 --> 01:09:37.946
Happy birthday.

01:09:37.979 --> 01:09:39.081
Thank you.

01:09:42.988 --> 01:09:44.960
<i>Oh, I have a secret.</i>

01:09:44.993 --> 01:09:46.162
<i>I like secrets.</i>

01:09:46.194 --> 01:09:47.663
Oh, yeah, you,
you have to promise

01:09:47.698 --> 01:09:48.968
not to tell anybody, eh.

01:09:51.939 --> 01:09:54.678
Uncle Dino... and Gianna.

01:09:57.784 --> 01:09:59.121
You knew?

01:09:59.154 --> 01:10:00.724
- Yeah, I did.
- Seriously?

01:10:00.757 --> 01:10:01.860
Oh, come on, Robert.

01:10:02.862 --> 01:10:04.198
You don't see the way
they look at each other?

01:10:05.266 --> 01:10:07.270
The stolen glances,
the way their eyes light up

01:10:07.304 --> 01:10:08.841
when they are in the same room?

01:10:10.176 --> 01:10:11.312
No. God,

01:10:11.345 --> 01:10:12.781
I guess I've been away too long.

01:10:13.884 --> 01:10:15.587
I'm happy for them though.

01:10:15.620 --> 01:10:16.589
Specially after Rocco.

01:10:16.622 --> 01:10:17.825
It's, it's good.

01:10:21.967 --> 01:10:23.703
Does my father's
reputation bother you?

01:10:24.638 --> 01:10:25.740
Does it bother you?

01:10:28.046 --> 01:10:29.048
He's my father.

01:10:31.853 --> 01:10:33.156
I get the pressure.

01:10:34.291 --> 01:10:36.062
I know it's not easy
to say no to him.

01:10:38.666 --> 01:10:40.136
Look, I know you, you blame him,

01:10:40.170 --> 01:10:41.705
or both our fathers
for pushing you into...

01:10:41.739 --> 01:10:44.078
I just don't want them
running our lives.

01:10:44.111 --> 01:10:44.979
That's all.

01:10:45.948 --> 01:10:47.651
Look, there's something
you should know, um.

01:10:53.362 --> 01:10:54.631
I think you're beautiful.

01:11:01.812 --> 01:11:03.649
I thought of my question.

01:11:03.683 --> 01:11:05.153
- Oh, yeah?
- Mhm.

01:11:05.186 --> 01:11:06.822
Tell me about your girlfriend.

01:11:06.856 --> 01:11:07.791
The one in England.

01:11:09.228 --> 01:11:10.296
Who told you?

01:11:11.732 --> 01:11:13.236
Word got around.

01:11:13.269 --> 01:11:14.304
My sister tell you?

01:11:14.338 --> 01:11:15.773
Yes.

01:11:15.807 --> 01:11:17.411
She met her when, uh,
she came to visit.

01:11:18.713 --> 01:11:20.850
Um, I don't know, it wasn't a,
it wasn't a big deal.

01:11:20.885 --> 01:11:21.953
It was a big deal to me...

01:11:22.854 --> 01:11:23.823
at the time.

01:11:26.463 --> 01:11:28.366
Okay, well, her name was Carol.

01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:32.073
And... and we liked each
other a lot but, um,

01:11:32.107 --> 01:11:33.209
we didn't love each other.

01:11:34.244 --> 01:11:35.280
How do you know?

01:11:38.252 --> 01:11:41.426
I guess you just got to know
what to look for.

01:11:41.459 --> 01:11:43.729
You stole that
from my short story.

01:11:43.763 --> 01:11:45.033
I did, I liked that one.

01:11:45.066 --> 01:11:46.001
It's not yours.

01:11:48.239 --> 01:11:49.475
Okay, uh.

01:11:50.544 --> 01:11:53.383
In law, when something
new is established,

01:11:53.417 --> 01:11:54.751
we call that a precedent.

01:11:55.988 --> 01:11:58.527
And you are the only
one that has ever set

01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:00.897
a precedent with my feelings.

01:12:02.935 --> 01:12:03.803
How was that?

01:12:04.939 --> 01:12:05.941
Stick to law.

01:12:05.975 --> 01:12:07.344
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:12:15.260 --> 01:12:16.128
Dance with me.

01:12:29.087 --> 01:12:30.991
Tell me about Tom.

01:12:31.025 --> 01:12:32.127
Don't you already know him?

01:12:33.397 --> 01:12:35.501
I'm doing some work
for his Uncle, but,

01:12:35.534 --> 01:12:36.403
never met Tom.

01:12:38.139 --> 01:12:39.341
I met him at uni.

01:12:40.343 --> 01:12:42.881
He swept you off your feet?

01:12:42.914 --> 01:12:44.217
Just as I had imagined.

01:12:46.456 --> 01:12:47.425
You're in love with him?

01:12:48.359 --> 01:12:52.535
I think I loved the idea
of being in love.

01:12:54.639 --> 01:12:57.043
Love was easy enough
to write about, I guess.

01:13:26.736 --> 01:13:28.172
There's something
I need to tell you.

01:13:28.205 --> 01:13:29.141
Yeah, what?

01:13:30.076 --> 01:13:31.479
It didn't happen, hey, hey,

01:13:31.513 --> 01:13:34.017
it didn't happen like you think.
It...

01:13:36.188 --> 01:13:38.292
Our fathers left the decision...
to marry up to me and,

01:13:38.325 --> 01:13:39.562
and it should have been
ours to make.

01:13:43.603 --> 01:13:45.541
You tell me this
after you marry me?

01:13:45.574 --> 01:13:47.177
I'm not proud of myself. I...

01:13:47.210 --> 01:13:49.415
You must think I'm a fool.

01:13:50.451 --> 01:13:52.320
Hey, look, I understand how,
how this looks, but it really

01:13:52.353 --> 01:13:53.523
doesn't change
how I feel about you.

01:13:53.557 --> 01:13:55.326
You were there, weren't you?

01:13:55.359 --> 01:13:56.629
At the meeting to discuss

01:13:56.663 --> 01:13:58.467
my future, what was best for me?

01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:00.136
Is that how it happened, Robert?

01:14:03.175 --> 01:14:06.148
Tom had his issues,
we both know that but you,

01:14:06.181 --> 01:14:07.384
your actions are far worse.

01:14:07.418 --> 01:14:08.787
You took advantage,

01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:10.323
- and for what?
- For you.

01:14:10.356 --> 01:14:11.191
Oh!

01:14:11.992 --> 01:14:13.430
Any interest I may
have had of you

01:14:13.463 --> 01:14:16.335
has been completely
erased by your deception.

01:14:16.368 --> 01:14:18.037
Listen to yourself. First,
you rejected me because

01:14:18.072 --> 01:14:19.575
you thought I was forced
to marry you by my father,

01:14:19.609 --> 01:14:21.311
and now you reject me
because I wasn't.

01:14:22.414 --> 01:14:24.217
Your father must be
so proud of you.

01:14:27.323 --> 01:14:29.059
If I'm guilty of anything,
it's that I've taken

01:14:29.094 --> 01:14:31.231
every opportunity I've ever
been given with open hands.

01:14:31.265 --> 01:14:34.472
- Unlike Tom.
- So, that's what I am, hm?

01:14:34.505 --> 01:14:35.507
An opportunity?

01:14:36.543 --> 01:14:37.645
And how was this opportunity
going to play out

01:14:37.678 --> 01:14:41.318
for you, Robert? In time I would
meekly surrender to you?

01:14:41.351 --> 01:14:44.257
Your charm, your status,
your gifts?

01:14:44.291 --> 01:14:45.861
And I would become
an obliging wife

01:14:45.894 --> 01:14:48.332
that you take for granted
like your mother?

01:14:48.365 --> 01:14:50.537
Is she my precedent?

01:14:50.571 --> 01:14:52.106
My father is fair game

01:14:52.140 --> 01:14:55.146
but do not disparage my mother.

01:14:55.179 --> 01:14:57.350
I've never taken
anyone for granted.

01:14:57.384 --> 01:14:59.622
You took me all
the way to the altar.

01:14:59.655 --> 01:15:01.158
You should look at it
as a compliment! Well,

01:15:01.191 --> 01:15:02.494
what should I have done,
meekly surrendered you

01:15:02.528 --> 01:15:03.228
to him as you so eloquently

01:15:03.262 --> 01:15:04.465
- put it?
- It wasn't up to you.

01:15:04.498 --> 01:15:05.867
You still don't get it!

01:15:05.901 --> 01:15:07.337
He didn't deserve you, Angela,
he kept secrets!

01:15:07.370 --> 01:15:09.675
- How can you be with some...
- So did you!

01:15:13.783 --> 01:15:16.154
You're impossible
to take for granted.

01:15:16.856 --> 01:15:18.893
Okay, the only secret
I've ever kept from you

01:15:18.927 --> 01:15:20.731
is not telling you
that I love you.

01:15:21.699 --> 01:15:23.369
I have always loved you.

01:15:26.208 --> 01:15:27.511
Get out, Robert.

01:15:27.544 --> 01:15:29.382
Angela, please.

01:15:50.557 --> 01:15:51.659
Can I come in for a sec?

01:15:58.272 --> 01:15:58.973
What's this?

01:15:59.975 --> 01:16:01.211
It's an annulment.

01:16:03.783 --> 01:16:05.854
I know you still pine for him.
I saw the letter.

01:16:08.393 --> 01:16:09.260
I tore it up.

01:16:12.333 --> 01:16:13.803
Why?

01:16:13.837 --> 01:16:15.339
Why haven't you signed this?

01:16:16.341 --> 01:16:17.978
I was hoping that in time

01:16:18.011 --> 01:16:19.715
you'd realize that
I was the man for you.

01:16:22.053 --> 01:16:24.859
I was ready
to give you a chance.

01:16:24.892 --> 01:16:26.462
A chance you didn't give me.

01:16:28.633 --> 01:16:29.935
Yeah, love is dumb, eh?

01:16:29.969 --> 01:16:31.104
You were dumb.

01:16:34.979 --> 01:16:36.649
You did give me
your hand in marriage.

01:16:44.999 --> 01:16:45.867
You know?

01:16:49.007 --> 01:16:50.042
It was your father.

01:16:51.512 --> 01:16:53.015
He was the one that told me
not to tell you

01:16:53.048 --> 01:16:54.350
before we got married.

01:16:55.052 --> 01:16:56.054
As for my father,

01:16:57.123 --> 01:16:58.960
don't blame him. He, uh,

01:16:58.993 --> 01:17:00.564
he washed his hands
of the arrangement.

01:17:03.837 --> 01:17:04.705
Anyway.

01:18:04.223 --> 01:18:05.760
Your ten o'clock is here.

01:18:07.029 --> 01:18:08.131
Thanks, Diana.

01:18:10.202 --> 01:18:11.572
Just send him in.

01:18:13.108 --> 01:18:14.611
Tomassino.

01:18:14.645 --> 01:18:15.814
Just Tom's fine.

01:18:15.847 --> 01:18:17.183
I figured if I cut it down

01:18:17.216 --> 01:18:18.619
to Tom from Tomassino I'd save

01:18:18.653 --> 01:18:19.989
about four years of my life.

01:18:24.097 --> 01:18:25.032
Take a seat.

01:18:30.944 --> 01:18:33.015
I've been told you've got
something for me to sign.

01:18:33.048 --> 01:18:33.983
Yeah.

01:18:38.826 --> 01:18:40.129
When'd you get back?

01:18:40.162 --> 01:18:41.297
Last week.

01:18:45.340 --> 01:18:47.209
Robert Prima, the lawyer, huh?

01:18:49.982 --> 01:18:52.019
You made quite
an impression on my uncle.

01:18:52.053 --> 01:18:53.055
He was a good man.

01:18:54.323 --> 01:18:55.259
Is that right?

01:18:56.396 --> 01:18:58.098
He did save you from bankruptcy,
mate.

01:19:01.939 --> 01:19:03.709
Yeah, well,
he could have settled for less.

01:19:05.713 --> 01:19:07.350
I think you should show
him some respect.

01:19:11.659 --> 01:19:12.727
My wife.

01:19:15.667 --> 01:19:17.236
You're a lucky man.

01:20:06.802 --> 01:20:08.004
What are you doing here, Tom?

01:20:09.207 --> 01:20:10.843
I went away for a while.
I had a couple

01:20:10.877 --> 01:20:12.515
of problems to sort through.

01:20:12.548 --> 01:20:14.083
You couldn't discuss
them with me?

01:20:15.887 --> 01:20:17.122
You left me in the dark.

01:20:18.024 --> 01:20:19.928
You let me believe
it was my godfather.

01:20:19.962 --> 01:20:21.231
You let me marry him.

01:20:22.199 --> 01:20:23.402
I came to the church.

01:20:25.474 --> 01:20:27.209
I, I was scared, Angela.

01:20:28.879 --> 01:20:30.451
What's changed?

01:20:30.484 --> 01:20:31.519
I've changed.

01:20:33.054 --> 01:20:35.827
I know about the gambling debts.

01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:39.033
The bookies... the check.

01:20:44.479 --> 01:20:45.813
I'm going to Sydney.

01:20:49.622 --> 01:20:51.726
I'm leaving tomorrow
and here's the address.

01:20:55.601 --> 01:20:57.069
Are you really happy with him?

01:22:00.228 --> 01:22:01.498
His secretary?

01:22:01.533 --> 01:22:03.268
Why would he go
near his secretary

01:22:03.301 --> 01:22:05.071
when he's got you waiting
at home for him?

01:22:05.105 --> 01:22:07.276
Robert wouldn't do that.

01:22:07.309 --> 01:22:08.344
He's not like that.

01:22:08.379 --> 01:22:10.416
I saw it, Bruno.

01:22:10.450 --> 01:22:12.052
And it wouldn't be
the first time.

01:22:12.085 --> 01:22:13.489
What's that supposed to mean?

01:22:13.522 --> 01:22:16.563
- Right, I'm calling Maria.
- No, Mom.

01:22:16.596 --> 01:22:19.166
Please, don't call, please.

01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:20.970
Wait until your father
finds out, Ange.

01:22:28.051 --> 01:22:29.086
What's going on?

01:22:37.705 --> 01:22:38.607
Hello?

01:23:16.582 --> 01:23:18.184
Your grandfather didn't like me.

01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:21.525
Didn't like Sicilians,
not for his only daughter.

01:23:22.661 --> 01:23:25.399
I had to work real hard
to win him over.

01:23:29.507 --> 01:23:30.877
I remember thinking to myself...

01:23:32.915 --> 01:23:34.785
how could someone be
so wrong about me?

01:23:35.754 --> 01:23:37.557
How could someone be so blind?

01:23:41.899 --> 01:23:44.437
That I was going to prove him
and everyone wrong.

01:23:45.641 --> 01:23:46.876
That sounds familiar.

01:23:50.315 --> 01:23:53.455
All that boy had to do
was tear up that check

01:23:53.489 --> 01:23:56.528
and face his problems like a man
and he would have been yours.

01:23:59.902 --> 01:24:01.773
A man who can't take
care of his problems,

01:24:01.806 --> 01:24:03.274
he can't take care
of his family.

01:24:09.353 --> 01:24:11.558
When you were born,
there were complications.

01:24:11.591 --> 01:24:12.961
If <i>Compare</i> Joe wasn't there...

01:24:12.995 --> 01:24:14.296
I know, Dad.

01:24:15.032 --> 01:24:16.401
But what you don't know...

01:24:19.373 --> 01:24:22.647
...is I wasn't out...
making deliveries

01:24:22.681 --> 01:24:25.419
when your mother went
into labor like I told you.

01:24:27.423 --> 01:24:28.693
Like I told everyone.

01:24:33.737 --> 01:24:34.671
I was playing cards.

01:24:37.945 --> 01:24:40.951
I left your mother
on her own to play cards.

01:24:42.921 --> 01:24:44.424
Oh, I never forgave myself.

01:24:47.096 --> 01:24:51.605
But from that moment on I swore
I would protect my family.

01:24:51.638 --> 01:24:53.609
You can't protect me from life,
Dad.

01:24:57.918 --> 01:24:59.722
I'm ashamed, Angela.

01:25:02.426 --> 01:25:03.428
And I'm sorry.

01:25:08.639 --> 01:25:09.942
I didn't even know
why he married you.

01:25:09.975 --> 01:25:10.944
He didn't have to.

01:25:12.446 --> 01:25:13.716
He told me he loved you.

01:25:20.931 --> 01:25:22.935
That was Rosalba
on the phone.

01:25:22.968 --> 01:25:24.738
She's in tears.

01:25:24.772 --> 01:25:27.076
She said...
Robert's been sleeping

01:25:27.109 --> 01:25:28.579
with his secretary.

01:25:29.714 --> 01:25:30.649
What?

01:25:30.683 --> 01:25:32.486
Roberto, what's going on?

01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:33.756
I haven't slept with anyone.

01:25:33.790 --> 01:25:35.059
Why would Angela lie?

01:25:35.092 --> 01:25:37.463
Because she's in
love with that other guy, Tom.

01:25:38.131 --> 01:25:39.067
He's back.

01:25:43.542 --> 01:25:45.479
If she told her family
that I cheated on her

01:25:45.512 --> 01:25:47.550
then maybe they'd understand
and let her out of

01:25:47.583 --> 01:25:49.587
this thing with an annulment,
I don't know.

01:25:49.621 --> 01:25:50.656
You want me to talk to Sal?

01:25:50.689 --> 01:25:51.792
No, I don't want...

01:25:56.034 --> 01:25:57.804
She was forced
into this thing once,

01:25:57.838 --> 01:25:58.840
I won't force her again.

01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:04.717
It's what she wants, it's,
this is what I want, Dad.

01:26:34.210 --> 01:26:36.916
Rob, that night,
Angela didn't give me

01:26:36.949 --> 01:26:38.585
the impression
that she was unhappy.

01:26:39.989 --> 01:26:42.560
I don't know, something
just doesn't sit right.

01:27:07.176 --> 01:27:08.211
Diana?

01:27:14.791 --> 01:27:16.027
Has someone been in here?

01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:36.301
Put those up.

01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:44.217
This belongs to my wife.

01:27:52.434 --> 01:27:54.203
Everyone
deserves a second chance.

01:28:14.777 --> 01:28:15.679
Where is she?

01:28:18.051 --> 01:28:19.220
Listen, I don't know
what you're playing at,

01:28:19.253 --> 01:28:21.090
- but she is my wife.
- She's not here.

01:28:23.028 --> 01:28:23.895
It's over.

01:28:37.089 --> 01:28:37.958
Good luck.

01:28:40.028 --> 01:28:40.964
Thanks.

01:28:55.460 --> 01:28:56.361
Hi.

01:28:57.296 --> 01:28:58.798
I'm making lasagna.

01:29:01.170 --> 01:29:02.339
You hate me that much?

01:29:07.517 --> 01:29:09.120
Angela, I know you think that I,

01:29:09.153 --> 01:29:10.856
- I did, I wouldn't...
- I know.

01:29:10.889 --> 01:29:13.328
Diana called me, I was at Mom's.

01:29:13.361 --> 01:29:15.198
We deserve a second chance.

01:29:18.872 --> 01:29:19.975
I want you to be my wife.

01:29:22.079 --> 01:29:23.214
It was always you.

01:29:37.577 --> 01:29:39.280
<i>You can rebel
against your parents,</i>

01:29:39.313 --> 01:29:41.150
<i>and you can rebel
against the world.</i>

01:29:42.554 --> 01:29:45.393
<i>But in the end,
you can't fight destiny,</i>

01:29:45.426 --> 01:29:47.630
<i>and you can't change fate.</i>

01:30:53.369 --> 01:30:58.369
