WEBVTT

00:03.303 --> 00:05.203
A thousand Hail Marys
or your life.

00:05.271 --> 00:07.432
Get down! Get down!

00:09.309 --> 00:12.506
You got access to some of the best
automatic assault rifles around.

00:12.579 --> 00:14.672
You got anything
particular in mind?

00:15.682 --> 00:18.276
This weapon is to what
KITTis to conventional cars.

00:20.153 --> 00:22.246
Come on in.
Make yourselves comfortable.

00:22.322 --> 00:25.086
Roberto!

00:26.593 --> 00:28.686
Hang on to your fenders, pal.
This could be tough.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.074

00:41.708 --> 00:46.805
Knight Rider, a shadowy flight
into the dangerous world of a man...

00:46.880 --> 00:48.905
who does not exist.

00:59.959 --> 01:01.950
Michael Knight, a young loner...

01:02.028 --> 01:04.553
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent,

01:04.631 --> 01:07.657
the helpless,
the powerless,

01:07.734 --> 01:11.295
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

02:23.376 --> 02:26.470
Excuse me. Father Carlos Laguna? Yes?

02:26.546 --> 02:28.776
I'm Michael Knight.

02:35.622 --> 02:37.613
Thank you for coming.

02:40.527 --> 02:43.655
Devon Miles told me
you might have a name for me.

02:43.730 --> 02:48.565
A contact. Yes. I'll be seeing
someone after the 1:00 Mass.

02:48.635 --> 02:50.569
He'll have the contact's name.

02:50.637 --> 02:54.368
I'll be going straight to my sister's
wedding reception. Could you meet me there?

02:54.440 --> 02:58.672
Yeah. Father, I'm on my way back
from New Orleans.

02:58.745 --> 03:01.043
I haven't had a chance to
get together with Devon yet.

03:01.114 --> 03:04.880
But from what he told me, it sounds
like something the police should handle.

03:04.951 --> 03:08.250
The attacks are hit-and-run.

03:08.321 --> 03:11.620
The police?

03:11.691 --> 03:16.390
They ask questions. They, uh, take
pictures. They count bullet holes.

03:17.797 --> 03:20.595
Tuesday afternoon,
they shot my brother Miguel.

03:21.668 --> 03:24.432
Two men in a car
with automatic assault rifles.

03:24.504 --> 03:28.270
He was standing in the middle
of a gas station in South Houston.

03:30.343 --> 03:32.641
You know, innocent people
could have been killed.

03:32.712 --> 03:36.204
But they don't care,
these, um, corazones de piedras.

03:36.282 --> 03:38.773
Corazones... It's what
my family calls them.

03:38.851 --> 03:43.413
Corazones de piedras
means, um, "hearts of stone."

03:45.959 --> 03:48.894
Michael, what do you think
of my new voice modulator?

03:48.962 --> 03:51.123
Nice, KITT. Real nice.

04:04.978 --> 04:07.674
As you see, no one knows
who these new people are.

04:07.747 --> 04:11.012
There are six of them,
at least four of whom are veterans,

04:11.084 --> 04:15.748
either Special Forces
or crack troops at any rate.

04:15.822 --> 04:20.656
Now the Laguna family are proud,
fiercely loyal and tough,

04:20.726 --> 04:22.888
but these gentlemen,
oh, they're different.

04:22.962 --> 04:24.930
They don't play by the old rules.

04:24.998 --> 04:30.026
They've got guns to sell, and in order to
do that, the Lagunas have got to move over.

04:30.103 --> 04:33.937
Well, the Lagunas resisted.

04:34.007 --> 04:38.000
As you see,
it's becoming a war in the streets.

04:38.077 --> 04:40.068
This is what it's over.

04:40.146 --> 04:45.015
Looks like something out of Buck Rogers
or Star Wars. It's called the Nunn X-19.

04:45.084 --> 04:47.814
Legally manufactured
in Lexington, Kentucky...

04:47.887 --> 04:52.256
and advertised as the most efficient
automatic assault rifle in the world today.

04:53.860 --> 04:57.921
It features as standard equipment
a rocket launcher.

04:57.997 --> 05:02.024
Rate of fire...
850 rounds per minute.

05:02.101 --> 05:04.968
So you see, it's much
more efficient than the Uzi...

05:05.038 --> 05:08.496
and anything the U.S. Army
is producing today.

05:08.574 --> 05:12.066
In other words,
a superior weapon in every respect.

05:12.145 --> 05:15.672
You said "legally manufactured."
Oh, it's legally manufactured.

05:15.748 --> 05:20.276
Diverted into the world of
black market arms in various ways.

05:20.353 --> 05:24.346
Weapons stolen, shipments lost,
records incomplete.

05:24.424 --> 05:28.019
Its primary market is
the turmoil in Central America.

05:28.094 --> 05:31.154
Here, I want you to get
the feel of it. Well...

05:31.230 --> 05:33.494
there's only one way to do that.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.775
Wow!

05:43.843 --> 05:46.277
Would you like to have
a go at the rocket?

05:46.346 --> 05:48.837
Oh, please do.

05:51.584 --> 05:53.882
Ready?

05:59.292 --> 06:02.455
Devon, just what is it you're looking
for from me? Find these people.

06:02.528 --> 06:06.589
Convince them that you're a black
market arms dealer, arrange a buy.

06:06.666 --> 06:09.499
If we could catch them dirty...
That is, with the guns...

06:09.569 --> 06:12.299
we can cut the pipeline
into Mexico,

06:12.372 --> 06:15.102
and we can save lives
on both sides of the border.

06:15.174 --> 06:19.634
It's gonna take more than a name from Father
Carlos Laguna to sell me as an arms dealer.

06:19.712 --> 06:22.806
Well, we've arranged for some help
in that area, Michael.

06:22.882 --> 06:26.374
Specialized data banks
on Texas, Mexico,

06:26.452 --> 06:29.012
ex-Special Forces
and Green Beret personnel,

06:29.088 --> 06:32.455
major and minor figures
in international arms smuggling.

06:32.525 --> 06:34.652
Is KITT ready?

06:34.727 --> 06:38.094
KITT's got it all. We've honed it
to the final contingency, my boy.

06:38.164 --> 06:41.156
In that case, you'd better let me get
out of here before I change my mind.

06:46.339 --> 06:48.569
Adios, mis amigos.

07:49.569 --> 07:53.005
Hey, dude. You're lookin' at
the fastest car in Houston.

07:53.072 --> 07:56.633
The mean machine. Blow that
black bucket right off the road.

07:56.709 --> 07:59.371
Yeah. Maybe some other time, huh?

07:59.445 --> 08:03.711
Yeah, sure.

08:05.251 --> 08:10.245
KITT, don't fall in love with one of these
beautiful cars and run off on me, huh?

08:10.323 --> 08:14.521
I wouldn't dream of it. Michael, have
you finished reviewing my new data banks?

08:14.594 --> 08:17.028
- Something I should know?
- Don't drink the water.

08:17.096 --> 08:21.760
- KITT, we're not in Mexico. We're just outside of Houston, Texas.
- I hear "marachis."

08:21.834 --> 08:26.533
I'm gonna have to get Bonnie to
reprogram your Spanish. It's mariachis.

08:28.841 --> 08:30.934
Hi, guys.

08:32.378 --> 08:35.347
Buenos dias.
Que pasa?

08:38.150 --> 08:41.210
- Michael!
- Hello, Father.

08:41.287 --> 08:44.313
Con permiso.
Excuse us.

08:47.393 --> 08:49.725
Did you get the name, Father?

08:49.795 --> 08:53.856
Our contact is Angie.
Angie? I expected a man.

08:53.933 --> 08:57.892
Yeah, well, in this business, it
pays to, uh, expect the unexpected.

08:57.970 --> 08:59.904
Where is she?

08:59.972 --> 09:04.705
All I know is she's a cocktail waitress at a
place called The Embers in downtown Houston.

09:04.777 --> 09:07.109
This is hard for you,
isn't it, Father?

09:07.179 --> 09:10.876
A thousand Hail Marys or your life.

09:15.788 --> 09:17.722
Roberto?
Yes?

09:17.790 --> 09:22.284
I want you to meet a friend of
mine, Michael Knight. How do you do?

09:22.361 --> 09:24.454
Thank you for coming.
Hello, Roberto.

09:24.530 --> 09:28.523
Roberto here is my youngest brother.
The youngest and the craziest.

09:28.601 --> 09:31.570
Vato loco.
To be Catholic is hard enough.

09:31.637 --> 09:34.572
But with a brother
that's a priest...

09:34.640 --> 09:36.631
Come on.

09:45.685 --> 09:47.243
- Michael?
- Yeah, KITT?

09:47.320 --> 09:49.515
There's a truck approaching
with men hidden in the bed.

09:53.326 --> 09:56.159
All right, get over here right away
and get in between us and them.

10:04.070 --> 10:06.436
Get down! Get down!

10:23.356 --> 10:25.153
Michael!

10:25.224 --> 10:29.024
Roberto's been hit. He's bleeding bad.
We've got to get him to a hospital.

10:42.475 --> 10:46.036
Well, it looks like the bullet
severed an artery in his leg,

10:46.112 --> 10:49.548
but they said with a little rest and
care he's gonna be all right. That's good.

10:49.615 --> 10:51.776
Yeah.
I'll be in touch, huh?

10:51.851 --> 10:55.082
Michael, be careful.

10:55.154 --> 10:57.247
Thank you, Father.
Yeah.

11:13.139 --> 11:16.666
What'll it be? A bottle of
beer, please. Whatever's coldest.

11:27.987 --> 11:31.115
- Keep the change, huh?
- Thank you, pardner.

11:31.190 --> 11:35.286
Looking for a cocktail waitress.
Maybe you know her. Name's Angie.

11:35.361 --> 11:38.421
Who wants her?
A friend of a friend.

12:07.827 --> 12:11.092
Are you lookin' for me?
You Angie?

12:12.398 --> 12:17.131
I'm whoever you want me to be. You want
me to be Angie, I'll be Angie. Who are you?

12:17.203 --> 12:21.139
Name's Michael. Well,
Michael, what can I do for you?

12:21.207 --> 12:23.141
Angie, I'm a gun collector.

12:23.209 --> 12:26.110
An acquaintance of mine told me you might
be able to steer me in the right direction.

12:26.178 --> 12:31.081
What direction is that? Well,
Angie, I'm looking for some rifles.

12:32.351 --> 12:36.845
Automatic assault weapons.
I don't know what you're talking about.

12:36.922 --> 12:39.186
Look, Angie, I, uh,

12:40.459 --> 12:43.053
I'll make it worth your while.

12:43.129 --> 12:45.290
Excuse me.
I don't know you.

12:45.364 --> 12:47.696
Well, let me just tell you
I'm a businessman.

12:47.767 --> 12:50.429
My business just happens
to be weapons.

12:50.503 --> 12:53.802
- Who gave you my name?
- A man you never heard of.

12:53.873 --> 12:56.865
A man who used to do business
with the Lagunas.

12:56.942 --> 12:59.035
Angie, he told me the Lagunas
are on their way out,

12:59.111 --> 13:02.376
and you might be able to introduce me
to the people who are on their way in.

13:02.448 --> 13:05.884
All I'm asking from you
is an introduction.

13:05.951 --> 13:09.352
If I'm not for real,
your people will know.

13:09.421 --> 13:11.719
I mean, that's their job,
not yours.

13:11.791 --> 13:14.225
I usually give
a five percent commission.

13:14.293 --> 13:16.955
In your case, I'll make it 10.

13:20.299 --> 13:22.324
Take it or leave it.

13:24.904 --> 13:26.872
I'll make a call.

13:26.939 --> 13:29.601
If the answer's yes,
I'll meet you in front in five minutes.

13:32.044 --> 13:35.138
If the answer's no,
I never want to see you again.

13:36.215 --> 13:39.707
You mind if I turn on this radio?
Go ahead.

13:39.785 --> 13:43.687
This is a weird-looking dash. Doesn't this
radio play anything besides Mexican music?

13:43.756 --> 13:46.589
It's a weird radio.
It goes with the dash.

13:54.300 --> 13:59.237
These people are bad. I sure
hope you're who you say you are.

13:59.305 --> 14:01.239
You always this suspicious?

14:01.307 --> 14:04.538
Mm-mmm. Just when it comes
to this kind of business.

14:07.046 --> 14:10.209
I hate it.

14:10.282 --> 14:12.750
Then why are you in it, Angie?

14:13.819 --> 14:17.949
I'm not in it. I just happen
to know these people, that's all.

14:34.340 --> 14:36.706
I'll be right there.
I just got to lock up.

14:41.213 --> 14:44.080
KITT, get the license plate number
on every car here.

14:44.149 --> 14:47.448
I don't have a strange-looking dash.
I'm proud of my dash.

14:47.519 --> 14:49.749
Don't take it personally.

14:49.822 --> 14:52.484
I just hope the name you gave me
is gonna work in there.

14:52.558 --> 14:57.052
I simply selected the name least likely to be
traceable with the information Bonnie added to...

14:57.129 --> 14:59.996
Okay. Okay.
I'm sorry I mentioned it.

15:00.065 --> 15:02.090
De nada. How's that?

15:02.167 --> 15:05.000
Not bad. Not bad.

15:06.071 --> 15:08.835
Tell them to bring water.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.737
Hey, R.J. How you doin'?

15:29.895 --> 15:31.886
I'll tell Ricky we're here.

15:44.376 --> 15:48.506
Howdy.
What brings you out this way?

15:49.848 --> 15:51.839
A little bit of this
and a little bit of that.

15:53.419 --> 15:56.582
How about you?
Same thing.

15:56.655 --> 16:00.216
A whole lot of this
and a whole lot of that.

16:02.027 --> 16:06.521
Well, I hope to see you later.
Don't you run off now, you hear?

16:17.710 --> 16:19.837
Michael.

16:31.256 --> 16:34.589
Blink and I'll put your brains
all over this wall, boy.

16:42.267 --> 16:45.395
Angie tells me you're
looking for some guns.

16:45.471 --> 16:49.271
- Well, who said we had 'em?
- A fella named Pavlon.

16:51.810 --> 16:54.870
Emile Pavlon told me
to look you guys up.

16:55.981 --> 16:58.006
Go get us a couple of cold beers.

17:02.154 --> 17:04.213
You know Emile, huh?

17:06.425 --> 17:11.954
- How's he doin' these days?
- He's not doing too good. He's in Torreon Federal Prison in Guatemala.

17:12.031 --> 17:15.522
Yeah, we heard about that.
Too bad. Is that where you met him?

17:15.601 --> 17:19.731
No. I met him in a little town called
Sabana Grande in Puerto Rico in 1979.

17:19.805 --> 17:24.002
He was running Thompsons
by the thousands down there to Belize.

17:24.076 --> 17:26.704
Did some business.
He told me to look you guys up.

17:26.779 --> 17:29.270
What'd he say about us?

17:29.348 --> 17:31.373
He said your prices are too high.

17:36.088 --> 17:40.752
He also told me you got access to some
of the best automatic assault rifles around.

17:40.826 --> 17:44.284
Now tell me somethin'. Does Emile
still have that tattoo on his arm?

17:44.363 --> 17:48.322
Which arm?
He's got 'em on both.

17:49.468 --> 17:51.459
You got anythin' particular in mind?

17:51.537 --> 17:55.633
The Nunn X-19. Hey, that's
a real good choice. Good gun.

17:55.707 --> 17:57.675
How many you lookin' for?
How many you got?

17:57.743 --> 18:00.109
- Twenty boxes, eight to a box.
- How much?

18:00.179 --> 18:03.012
- Fifteen hundred a copy. You want 'em all?
- Yeah.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.846
- Two hundred and forty thousand, cash.
- When can we do it?

18:05.918 --> 18:07.647
Well, when can you have the money?

18:09.822 --> 18:12.620
Tomorrow.
We'll be ready.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.917
When you're ready,
contact Angie.

18:17.963 --> 18:19.954
Thanks.

18:24.503 --> 18:26.937
See if you can get a line
on Emile Pavlon.

18:27.005 --> 18:29.735
I want to know if this guy
is who he says he is.

18:31.543 --> 18:33.943
The wages of sin is death.

18:34.012 --> 18:36.105
I know what the Bible says, Carlos.

18:36.181 --> 18:40.083
Mi hermano, if you want to talk to me,
talk to me as a brother, not as a priest.

18:40.152 --> 18:43.918
I can't separate the two, Roberto.
No Christian can.

18:48.060 --> 18:51.086
You can't go on living
with one foot in each world.

18:51.163 --> 18:53.723
Church on Sunday,
business as usual on Monday.

18:53.799 --> 18:56.199
Why not?
The rest of the world does.

18:59.271 --> 19:01.205
Roberto,

19:02.341 --> 19:04.332
you listen to me.

19:05.577 --> 19:09.035
You're the youngest.
You can change.

19:09.114 --> 19:11.048
You can leave all
this craziness behind you.

19:11.116 --> 19:13.846
How? By becoming
a priest like you?

19:15.454 --> 19:19.049
One priest is enough in any
family. Someone has to fight. Why?

19:19.124 --> 19:22.821
Because if we don't fight,
we'll be killed. You know that.

19:22.895 --> 19:27.730
It's one thing to sit in church and talk
about violence and death and how it must end.

19:27.799 --> 19:31.860
But it's another thing when you can't drive down
the street without wondering if they're behind you.

19:31.937 --> 19:35.896
It's another thing when you can't even go to
your own sister's wedding without being shot.

19:37.075 --> 19:40.670
You talk about me changing, leaving.

19:40.746 --> 19:43.306
What about the family?

19:43.382 --> 19:47.341
What should I do, turn my back
while they shoot my brothers?

19:47.419 --> 19:50.980
They're my brothers, too, you know.

19:51.056 --> 19:54.685
Because I don't fight and shoot and kill,
does that mean I've turned my back?

19:54.760 --> 19:58.560
Not to my family.
To violence, yes.

19:58.630 --> 20:01.656
To sin and death,
yes, I've turned my back.

20:02.668 --> 20:04.898
They're different things,
Roberto.

20:06.972 --> 20:11.068
Don't turn away from me.

20:56.588 --> 20:59.284
You never cease to amaze me.

20:59.358 --> 21:01.792
You almost made a liar
out of me on this one, Michael.

21:01.860 --> 21:04.658
I believe I told you that
I had every contingency covered.

21:04.730 --> 21:06.823
Looks to me like you do.

21:06.898 --> 21:09.423
By the skin of my teeth.

21:09.501 --> 21:14.097
Two hundred and forty thousand dollars is
a large sum of money to raise overnight.

21:14.172 --> 21:16.538
I had to borrow
from several accounts.

21:16.608 --> 21:20.237
One of them being
the annual charity benefit fund.

21:20.312 --> 21:22.746
Oh, you're telling me to be
careful, right? Please do.

21:22.814 --> 21:25.044
What's that?
A receipt for the money.

21:25.117 --> 21:29.076
You don't trust me? My dear
fellow, a mere formality.

21:32.891 --> 21:35.382
Thank you.
Good. I can read it.

21:38.597 --> 21:42.294
How's KITT? Practicing
Spanish every chance he gets.

21:42.367 --> 21:45.700
I had him run a make on all the cars
that were there last night.

21:45.771 --> 21:47.739
Interesting collection
of people, Devon.

21:47.806 --> 21:51.708
There's a couple from Canada,
people from Florida, a couple from Peru.

21:51.777 --> 21:55.269
I'm not surprised.
The Stones are nomads.

21:55.347 --> 21:59.044
They have no home, no permanent
address, no families, no roots.

22:00.485 --> 22:04.251
They will rent a house, live in it for a
couple of weeks, then suddenly disappear.

22:04.323 --> 22:08.487
They seem to have adopted techniques of
modern guerrilla warfare and brought it home.

22:08.560 --> 22:11.495
The Lagunas are sitting ducks.

22:13.598 --> 22:17.227
When will you know if it's
on? When the phone rings.

22:17.302 --> 22:19.998
Michael, don't take any chances.

22:21.506 --> 22:25.738
The serial numbers on these bills
have been recorded.

22:25.811 --> 22:29.247
When you take possession
of the weapons, call me.

22:29.314 --> 22:33.114
You got it.

22:36.021 --> 22:40.424
We meeting them at the house?
- Uh-uh. Somewhere else.

22:40.492 --> 22:44.121
I'm sorry about last night.
I mean, the way they treated you.

22:44.196 --> 22:46.528
That's all in a day's work.

22:46.598 --> 22:50.762
- You seem different.
- From what?

22:50.836 --> 22:53.100
The other people in this business.

22:55.841 --> 22:58.366
So do you.

23:00.145 --> 23:03.444
It's just up ahead.
There it is.

23:03.515 --> 23:05.710
Turn left on that little road.

23:20.365 --> 23:25.064
What's that? It's a
computerized burglar alarm.

23:25.137 --> 23:27.162
I just got it the other day.

23:29.708 --> 23:32.438
I thought you said they'd supply
transportation for the guns.

23:32.511 --> 23:35.105
They did.
It's probably in the warehouse.

23:38.316 --> 23:41.149
Go ahead.
They're waitin' on you.

23:41.219 --> 23:43.881
I like company.

23:43.955 --> 23:45.946
They don't.

24:01.873 --> 24:03.966
Drop the briefcase!

24:06.878 --> 24:10.314
Drop it or so help me
I'll shoot you where you stand.

24:21.293 --> 24:23.352
Is this how the Stones do business?

24:23.428 --> 24:26.693
They don't know
anything about this.

24:26.765 --> 24:31.031
If you try and follow me,
so help me, I'll shoot.

24:44.349 --> 24:46.340
I'm sorry, Michael.

24:47.486 --> 24:50.478
I am really sorry.

24:56.761 --> 24:59.252
KITT, check your scanners.
You got a car out there?

24:59.331 --> 25:03.165
- No, Michael. But there is a helicopter.
- All right, get in here fast!

25:17.549 --> 25:19.540
Let's get that chopper.

25:33.198 --> 25:37.362
KITT, I'm activating ground-to-air
surveillance and the electrical jammer.

25:37.435 --> 25:41.269
- Michael, she's got
Devon's money, doesn't she?

25:41.339 --> 25:43.603
Yes, she does.

25:50.482 --> 25:53.940
Do you know who the Foundation's
annual charity benefit is for?

25:54.019 --> 25:56.487
- I don't want to know.
- Widows and orphans.

25:56.555 --> 26:00.787
Well, like I said,
let's get that chopper.

26:00.859 --> 26:03.726
Give me everything
you got on the jammer.

26:08.867 --> 26:12.598
Hey, I can't get this thing to climb.
What the hell's goin' on here?

26:12.671 --> 26:14.468
She just won't climb.

26:22.647 --> 26:27.516
Pull enough juice from that coil to bring her down
and I swear to you I'll erect a monument in your name.

26:27.586 --> 26:30.180
I'll do my best, Michael.

26:33.224 --> 26:36.591
It's working, KITT. She's gonna
have trouble clearing that peak.

26:37.662 --> 26:39.789
All right, keep her steady.

26:58.183 --> 27:02.017
- What happened? - I was forced
to activate my retro-rockets. Look.

27:08.960 --> 27:12.361
- Ohh!
- Widows and orphans, Michael.

27:12.430 --> 27:13.897
- KITT?
- Yes, Michael?

27:13.965 --> 27:15.489
No monument.

27:26.911 --> 27:30.244
I don't know anything about her.
But, Father, you gave me her name.

27:30.315 --> 27:32.249
It was given to me.
By whom?

27:32.317 --> 27:35.150
I can't tell you that. What do you mean you
can't tell me that? You got to tell me that.

27:35.220 --> 27:38.656
She's robbed me of $240,000
that I'm responsible for.

27:38.723 --> 27:42.215
It was given to me
in the sanctity of the confessional.

27:42.293 --> 27:45.990
I'd be violating my vows if I told
you. Just please try to understand.

27:48.066 --> 27:51.229
Michael, Roberto's disappeared.

27:51.302 --> 27:53.600
What do you mean Roberto's
disappeared? He was in the hospital.

27:53.672 --> 27:57.438
He checked out an hour ago
against medical advice.

27:57.509 --> 28:01.001
No one's heard from him. Father, you
don't... You don't think it's the Stones?

28:01.079 --> 28:05.573
I don't know what else to
think. Do you? I'll let you know.

28:16.795 --> 28:19.093
I'm sorry. Visiting hours
are over. I'm not visiting.

28:19.164 --> 28:22.133
I'm here to see about a patient that
was in this room... Roberto Laguna?

28:22.200 --> 28:25.897
You'll have to check with admissions. I've
checked with admissions. They don't know.

28:25.970 --> 28:30.907
Where you on duty when he left the room? I'm
really not authorized to answer these questions.

28:30.975 --> 28:34.069
Miss, it's a matter of life and death.

28:36.181 --> 28:40.117
Come here. I want you to take a look at
something. KITT, I need a visual on Angie.

28:40.185 --> 28:42.119
Right away.

28:42.187 --> 28:45.315
What's going on here?
Wh-What kind of car is this?

28:45.390 --> 28:47.119
Is that the girl?

28:47.192 --> 28:50.753
- Oh, my God. That's amazing.
- Is that the girl?

28:50.829 --> 28:53.127
Yes.
Thank you very much.

28:55.433 --> 28:57.560
It is amazing.

29:10.048 --> 29:13.643
KITT, give me all you got on Angie.
Full name... Angeline Martin.

29:13.718 --> 29:16.516
- Devon is calling.
- Tell him I'm in transit.

29:18.189 --> 29:22.683
Angeline Martin,
Texas driver's license number... F10762B.

29:22.761 --> 29:27.789
No registered vehicle, no current address,
father deceased, mother's whereabouts unknown.

29:27.866 --> 29:29.800
- Great.
- I'm not finished.

29:29.868 --> 29:31.631
Well, I'm sorry.

29:31.703 --> 29:34.001
Sister... Monica Johnson, divorced.

29:34.072 --> 29:36.939
Angie used her address for mail
until two months ago.

29:37.008 --> 29:41.308
Well, if they're looking to lay low for a couple
of days, it's worth a shot. Where does she live?

29:41.379 --> 29:45.042
Gatesville, Texas.
Thirty-nine miles west-southwest of Waco.

29:45.116 --> 29:48.017
KITT, plot me the most likely course
from here to Gatesville.

29:48.086 --> 29:50.316
Get me the sister's address.

29:55.827 --> 29:57.920
Devon's calling again.
Tell him...

29:57.996 --> 30:01.363
Michael, I'm not constitutionally
constructed to lie.

30:01.432 --> 30:05.926
None of us are, KITT. Think of it as
a temporary condition for a good cause.

30:06.004 --> 30:08.666
What cause?
My hide.

30:49.881 --> 30:53.681
Buenos dias, mis amigos.

30:53.751 --> 30:56.276
- How did you find us?
- What do you want?

30:56.354 --> 30:59.118
To start with, how about the money.
Come on in.

30:59.190 --> 31:01.920
Make yourselves comfortable.

31:01.993 --> 31:04.223
I'll take that.

31:08.700 --> 31:12.761
Great. How much is gone?

31:12.837 --> 31:14.862
Four hundred dollars
and some change.

31:14.939 --> 31:19.933
- Helicopters aren't cheap, you know.
- Yeah, I know. Not much is these days, except maybe promises.

31:20.011 --> 31:24.038
- You got your money back. What do you want from us?
- For a change of pace how about the truth?

31:25.984 --> 31:28.612
- Why'd you set me up?
- I had no other choice.

31:28.686 --> 31:30.950
Oh, I don't know what that means.

31:32.056 --> 31:35.150
All right, you want the truth?

31:37.929 --> 31:42.491
Roberto and I met in The Embers
three months ago.

31:42.567 --> 31:45.559
We fell in love.
We didn't mean to.

31:45.637 --> 31:48.231
It just happened.

31:50.041 --> 31:52.032
And then we realized...

31:54.946 --> 32:00.748
we couldn't be in love,
not in Houston, not in Texas...

32:02.553 --> 32:05.078
where the Lagunas
and the Stones are at war.

32:06.991 --> 32:10.654
We wanted to leave,
but we didn't have enough money.

32:12.330 --> 32:16.096
And then you came along
with a briefcase full of money.

32:17.368 --> 32:21.930
- It seemed like... like Providence.
- It wasn't.

32:22.006 --> 32:26.670
Who are you to talk, to judge?
You deal in illegal weapons.

32:26.744 --> 32:31.511
No, Roberto, I say I deal in illegal
weapons. There's a big difference.

32:31.582 --> 32:34.346
Wh-Who are you?
That doesn't matter.

32:34.419 --> 32:37.582
What matters is I'm here
to stop this warfare,

32:37.655 --> 32:42.752
to stop the illegal sale of X-19s
to Central America or anyplace else.

32:42.827 --> 32:45.557
I'm telling you, Angie,
I still need your help.

32:45.630 --> 32:50.465
- Y-You mean you'd trust me, after all
that's happened? - I didn't say that.

32:53.538 --> 32:56.837
- Well, what do you want me to do?
- Come back to Houston with me.

32:56.908 --> 33:00.503
Why? If you said you did
what you did on your own...

33:00.578 --> 33:05.743
if that's true... Ricky and D.D.
still got 20 cases of X-19s for sale.

33:07.185 --> 33:09.983
But this is our chance.
If we don't get out now...

33:10.054 --> 33:12.284
There's more to it than
you and Roberto at stake here.

33:12.357 --> 33:14.985
There are other people,
other lives.

33:15.059 --> 33:17.687
You can't make a new start...

33:17.762 --> 33:20.629
until you clean this one up first.

33:20.698 --> 33:24.225
Now I'm telling you, Angie,
I need your help. Please.

33:42.253 --> 33:44.847
Devon, it's all right now.

33:44.922 --> 33:48.585
Michael, don't tell me.
You lost the money.

33:48.659 --> 33:51.628
- I didn't lose the money.
- Then why have you been avoiding me?

33:51.696 --> 33:54.790
- I ran into a few problems.
- You lost the money.

33:54.866 --> 33:57.699
Well, I-I misplaced the money,
but I got it back.

33:57.769 --> 34:00.602
I knew it. Michael,

34:00.671 --> 34:05.836
that charity money was for... I know,
Devon, I know... Widows and orphans.

34:05.910 --> 34:09.641
Listen, I gotta go. I'll call you
as soon as I know what's happening.

34:09.714 --> 34:11.773
Give my love to Bonnie, huh?

34:15.253 --> 34:19.690
What'd you tell them? I told them we were
delayed, but everything was all right now.

34:19.757 --> 34:21.690
Are we on?

34:21.759 --> 34:26.219
Because we didn't show up today, they want
to see the money first this time, in person.

34:49.320 --> 34:52.346
Eduardo, es Roberto.

34:52.422 --> 34:54.755
Como estas? Si, si, si.

34:54.826 --> 34:59.092
Mira, Edward, something's happened.

35:01.199 --> 35:04.862
I know how we can find
el corazones de piedras.

35:29.193 --> 35:31.684
It's all here.
What happened today?

35:31.762 --> 35:34.322
Sorry, guys.
I ran into a few problems.

35:34.398 --> 35:36.559
Yeah, but you don't expect
any problems tomorrow, do you?

35:36.634 --> 35:39.603
Nope. I'll be here with the money.
You be here with the guns.

35:39.670 --> 35:42.400
12:00 noon.
That's fine by me.

35:42.473 --> 35:44.441
This is your last chance, boy.

35:44.509 --> 35:48.275
You screw up tomorrow and you
find somebody else, if you can.

35:48.346 --> 35:50.644
I'll be here.
Hey, hold on a minute.

35:50.715 --> 35:53.343
I forgot to tell you.
This fella stopped by.

35:53.417 --> 35:57.183
Says he knows
an old friend of yours.

36:00.024 --> 36:02.424
My friends here tell me
you know Emile Pavlon.

36:02.493 --> 36:04.961
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

36:06.597 --> 36:09.361
You know Emile?
He's one of my closest friends.

36:09.433 --> 36:13.267
Then he went to Guatemala
and voila.

36:13.337 --> 36:15.999
I'd visit him, but I have
an aversion to prison.

36:16.073 --> 36:18.064
Yeah, I know what you mean.

36:18.142 --> 36:21.600
Well, it's nice to meet
a friend of Emile's.

36:23.314 --> 36:27.114
Good luck. Yeah, thanks. Take it easy.

36:33.357 --> 36:36.224
You know him?

36:36.294 --> 36:40.560
I've never seen him before.
Do you think he's with the Lagunas?

36:40.631 --> 36:44.067
That'd be my guess. They've been
trying to get a fix on us for months.

36:44.135 --> 36:46.899
Well, we'll have a big surprise
for them tomorrow.

36:46.971 --> 36:50.429
Three, four, five thousand.

36:50.508 --> 36:53.568
It's always a pleasure
doing business with you, Emile.

37:09.660 --> 37:11.924
Don't be too mad at me.

37:11.996 --> 37:14.726
Right now, I'm more concerned
with who that guy was back there.

37:14.799 --> 37:18.098
- Who do you think he was?
- I don't know. That's the problem.

37:18.169 --> 37:20.660
You know him?
Uh-uh.

37:24.508 --> 37:26.601
I know I lied to you, Michael.

37:26.677 --> 37:29.168
I'm not askin' you to excuse it.

37:29.247 --> 37:32.341
Just try and understand it.

37:32.416 --> 37:34.407
It won't happen again.

37:35.987 --> 37:38.956
- I'd like to believe that.
- You can.

37:41.125 --> 37:43.855
I just hope Roberto
stays where he is.

37:43.928 --> 37:46.158
Well, he's waitin' for me.
Why wouldn't he stay?

37:47.665 --> 37:50.793
- He loves me.
- Oh, I don't doubt that.

37:50.868 --> 37:54.463
- Then what do you mean?
- Angie, he's been in love with you for months.

37:55.940 --> 37:57.931
He's been a Laguna all his life.

38:20.064 --> 38:22.589
Yeah, who is it?

38:22.667 --> 38:24.726
Devon.

38:29.740 --> 38:33.039
- Hello. Going dancing?
- Don't I wish.

38:33.110 --> 38:35.874
What's up? I happened to
be in the neighborhood.

38:35.946 --> 38:39.643
Yeah, and I happen to be a high-wire
walker on my way to a circus.

38:41.452 --> 38:45.513
- What is it?
- I've been in touch with the Guatemalan authorities.

38:46.624 --> 38:49.593
Yeah. I appreciate that.

38:49.660 --> 38:53.426
Emile Pavlon escaped from
Torreon Prison the day before yesterday.

38:57.835 --> 39:00.531
Michael, I want you
to cancel that buy tomorrow.

39:00.604 --> 39:03.004
Why?
Because he had help.

39:03.074 --> 39:06.202
Somebody paid off the guards. It may
have been someone working with the Stones.

39:06.277 --> 39:08.211
It could have been
someone else, too, you know.

39:08.279 --> 39:11.612
Look, Emile Pavlon was in jail
for over two years.

39:11.682 --> 39:16.381
Doesn't it strike you as peculiar that he should
escape the day after you use his name for cover?

39:19.323 --> 39:23.350
Michael, I admire your dedication.

39:24.895 --> 39:27.125
I love your courage.

39:27.198 --> 39:30.395
But I do not, however,
want to mourn your death.

39:32.470 --> 39:35.462
What about the other deaths, Devon?

39:35.539 --> 39:39.100
You know, what about the people
in Central America?

39:39.176 --> 39:41.440
What about the innocent people
in Houston?

39:43.914 --> 39:47.042
As usual, the decision is yours.

39:47.118 --> 39:51.145
If you decide not to
take the chance, call me.

39:51.222 --> 39:53.486
What happens
if I don't make that call?

39:54.959 --> 39:57.792
Then I shall be waiting
on standby as agreed.

39:57.862 --> 40:03.562
Michael, whatever you decide to do,
I'm behind you all the way.

40:10.007 --> 40:15.502
Michael, I don't know what it is.
What?

40:18.349 --> 40:20.340
I'm so scared.

40:21.719 --> 40:23.744
I have this awful feelin'.

40:26.056 --> 40:28.923
It's gonna be okay, isn't it?

40:30.461 --> 40:32.452
It'll be okay.

41:05.930 --> 41:08.524
- What are you doin' now?
- I'll explain later.

41:08.599 --> 41:11.500
- There's no one inside.
- What's that, that voice?

41:11.569 --> 41:15.061
- Michael, there are three cars approaching.
- Where are they? How far away?

41:15.139 --> 41:20.008
Two hundred yards and closing fast. I've also
detected movement in the ravine by the road.

41:24.381 --> 41:28.010
- It's an ambush. Notify Devon.
- Michael, over the rise.

41:32.923 --> 41:34.686
Roberto.

41:34.758 --> 41:36.749
Oh, God, no.

41:38.762 --> 41:41.754
He'll be killed.
They'll all be killed.

41:41.832 --> 41:43.993
Angie!

41:50.841 --> 41:54.208
Roberto!
Roberto!

41:56.146 --> 41:59.877
All right, get ready.
Open the door!

42:01.085 --> 42:03.076
Now!

42:21.372 --> 42:24.170
Let's hit 'em with a little tear gas.

42:51.135 --> 42:53.626
Good ol' Devon.

42:56.073 --> 42:59.565
This is the police. Cease firing
and throw down your weapons.

42:59.643 --> 43:03.306
I repeat, cease firing
and throw down your weapons.

43:28.572 --> 43:31.769
- Michael, Ricky's gettin' away.
- Hang on, Angie.

44:04.575 --> 44:07.043
Here we go.

44:59.029 --> 45:03.659
It's over.
You're free now, you and Roberto.

45:26.990 --> 45:31.950
Devon, Roberto wouldn't be here
if I hadn't brought Angie back.

45:32.029 --> 45:36.762
I'll see what I can do. Captain, I rather
think in this case an exception is in order.

45:49.947 --> 45:52.575
Need a lift? Well, you don't
think I'm gonna hoof it, do you?

45:52.649 --> 45:54.844
Oh, I see you're picking up
on the local vernacular.

45:54.918 --> 45:57.478
All I need to learn now
is the Texas two-step.

45:57.554 --> 45:59.886
I would have thought the
Viennese waltz is more your style.

45:59.957 --> 46:03.017
Dear fella, the fox-trot
is as far back as I can go.

46:22.346 --> 46:24.405
Why, thank you, KITT.

46:24.481 --> 46:26.779
Show-off.

46:33.190 --> 46:36.648
Howdy. Well, lookee who's here.

46:36.727 --> 46:40.857
Now you did say "some other time,"
didn't you, dude?

46:40.931 --> 46:42.865
Michael, I believe those were
your exact words.

46:42.933 --> 46:46.528
Okay, mean machine,
pedal to the metal.

47:39.489 --> 47:43.448
Michael Knight, a lone crusader
in a dangerous world,

47:43.527 --> 47:46.553
the world of the Knight Rider.
