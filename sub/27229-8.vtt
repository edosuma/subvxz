This award is such an honor;
Vet of the Year.

01:04.106 --> 01:06.984
Thank you,
Bay Area Small Business Association.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.068
Boring.

01:10.904 --> 01:14.366
Next time, fall on your face
like Jennifer Lawrence at the Oscars.

01:15.450 --> 01:18.954
Oh, no one's gonna hear
this acceptance speech, anyway.

01:19.037 --> 01:21.582
That Dr. Jeffries wins every year.

01:21.665 --> 01:24.668
He's always cuddling
baby hedgehogs on Instagram.

01:26.336 --> 01:27.838
I can't compete with that.

01:29.047 --> 01:31.508
Mom, I finished all my homework.

01:31.592 --> 01:32.884
So, can I go?

01:32.968 --> 01:35.887
Yes, you can. You can go.
Where are you going?

01:37.306 --> 01:39.933
Our kids are going to
their first high-school party.

01:40.017 --> 01:42.894
Party? Whose house is it?

01:42.978 --> 01:45.230
Will there be parents? How many kids?

01:45.939 --> 01:47.524
Will there be a theme?

01:48.775 --> 01:52.279
What? I'm a party planner. I'm always
looking for new ideas to steal.

01:54.239 --> 01:58.035
Guys, it's not even a party. It's a bunch
of ninth-graders playing Mario Kart.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.412
Should I hook 'em up
to the lie detector, Mom?

02:02.748 --> 02:06.376
I don't need a lie detector. I'm a mother.

02:08.253 --> 02:11.089
Okay, home by ten,
cell phones on at all times,

02:11.173 --> 02:12.758
and make good choices.

02:12.841 --> 02:15.052
And if a theme breaks out, let me know.

02:16.553 --> 02:18.430
-Bye.
-See you, guys. Bye.

02:18.513 --> 02:20.140
Okay, thanks again. No kisses.

02:21.099 --> 02:22.934
Oh, good job. Come in.

02:26.938 --> 02:30.025
Hey. I'm so glad you guys are here.

02:30.108 --> 02:32.569
Yeah, I was just practicing
my acceptance speech

02:32.653 --> 02:34.946
for the BAASBA award
that I'm never gonna win.

02:36.239 --> 02:38.659
Well, if you do win, don't thank me,

02:38.742 --> 02:42.412
because with Jesse and I co-hosting
the award ceremony, it'll look rigged.

02:43.413 --> 02:44.581
Which it's not.

02:45.791 --> 02:47.125
Unless it is.

02:48.919 --> 02:49.920
It is, isn't it?

02:51.630 --> 02:52.631
I was never here.

02:54.049 --> 02:55.050
I'm here. I'm here.

03:04.518 --> 03:06.978
Hey, don't I recognize you
from our wedding?

03:07.062 --> 03:09.272
Ha ha ha ha ha. Very funny.

03:09.648 --> 03:11.149
Our schedules have been crazy.

03:11.233 --> 03:14.152
With me working mornings
and Jesse at the Smash Club all night,

03:14.236 --> 03:17.614
-we barely see each other.
-The only time I see her is in my dreams.

03:18.365 --> 03:21.243
Although occasionally
she morphs into Abe Lincoln.

03:22.119 --> 03:24.329
Sort of hot.
I've never been with a bearded lady.

03:25.997 --> 03:27.791
All right, tick-tock. Here's Pamela.

03:29.334 --> 03:32.671
Don't be late for the pick-up.
I have a four o'clock facial appointment.

03:32.754 --> 03:35.298
These pores don't tighten themselves,
you know.

03:35.757 --> 03:38.427
D.J., thank you for letting us host
Mommy and Me here.

03:38.510 --> 03:40.887
-All right. Love you.
-Love you, too.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.434
Easier kissing Abe Lincoln.

03:47.894 --> 03:49.479
Fine, we're out of practice.

03:49.563 --> 03:52.649
Oh, and FYI; those mommies,

03:52.733 --> 03:56.319
they are snobs in yoga pants,
and they never let me lead the sing-along.

03:58.447 --> 04:02.117
Sing-along? Over my dead body.

Thank you. But, you know,
I've sang all over the world,

04:12.502 --> 04:16.047
from ramen houses
to international pancake houses, but...

04:16.715 --> 04:19.092
nothing compares
to singing to my little girl

04:19.176 --> 04:21.344
right here in the good ol' US of A.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.180
[others] Aw!

04:23.263 --> 04:26.516
Ladies, not only did we get
our first daddy at Mommy and Me,

04:26.600 --> 04:31.688
-but we got the best one ever.
-Aw, I'm sure your baby daddies are great.

04:31.772 --> 04:32.814
Are they here?

04:34.232 --> 04:35.984
No, they are not. I am the best.

04:37.444 --> 04:41.156
It's refreshing to see a father take
such a hands-on interest in his child.

04:41.239 --> 04:45.076
I'm cuckoo about this little munchkin,
and, you know, I feel it's important

04:45.160 --> 04:47.537
for both parents to contribute equally,
you know?

04:47.621 --> 04:50.081
Did you just drop in from Planet Perfect?

04:51.958 --> 04:54.586
All right, who wants a cookie?
Cookie time.

04:54.669 --> 04:57.589
Come on. All the kids come over here.
All the kids-- hi, mothers.

04:57.672 --> 05:00.717
If you're interested,
a few of us moms do an after-party.

05:00.801 --> 05:04.554
The kids get a little more playtime,
and we have adult time.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.181
You know what I mean?

05:07.516 --> 05:09.684
Oh, wine in a sippy cup, right?

05:10.685 --> 05:12.604
Mommies, we got a keeper.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.690
-I thought of that right off the--
-Ahem!

05:18.568 --> 05:22.072
Uh, ma'am, we usually ask the nannies
to stay in the car.

05:24.157 --> 05:29.162
No, no. This is Becky, my wife Becky.
See? Not in yoga pants.

05:30.705 --> 05:33.416
Yep, that's me. Becky with the good pants.

05:36.628 --> 05:37.629
Because I work.

05:39.005 --> 05:42.843
Work? Oh, you poor thing.
I used to have to do that.

05:42.926 --> 05:46.304
-You little--
-All right. Okay, okay.

05:47.305 --> 05:50.058
-See? Snobs in yoga pants.
-Oh, come on.

05:50.141 --> 05:52.185
These mothers have been
warm and welcoming.

05:52.269 --> 05:54.563
Oh, please. More like hot and bothered.

05:54.688 --> 05:57.107
What? They've been very friendly,

05:57.190 --> 05:59.401
and they wanted to see
how soft my hair was.

05:59.484 --> 06:02.445
-I didn't let them touch it, did I, Pammy?
-Yes, you did.

06:06.074 --> 06:09.578
Okay. Well, I think it is time to find
a new Mommy and Me class.

06:09.661 --> 06:11.246
Come on, Pammy loves this class.

06:11.329 --> 06:12.831
Apparently so does Daddy.

06:14.666 --> 06:18.169

You never know when you have a vet

I'm not sure they take strapping
into consideration.

08:24.671 --> 08:27.173
Jackson, it appears to me
you are drunk as a stunk.

08:29.342 --> 08:30.510
Don't you mean skunk?

08:30.593 --> 08:34.305
No, stunk. Eduardo Stunk
was our town drunk.

08:36.016 --> 08:37.308
How did this happen?

08:38.101 --> 08:40.562
Dad, we were just hanging,
playing video games,

08:40.645 --> 08:43.857
and then every senior jock
showed up with beers and was chanting,

08:43.940 --> 08:45.692
"Yo, grab a beer, Golden Toe."

08:45.775 --> 08:47.235
Golden Toe!

this was weak and a bad choice.

08:59.914 --> 09:01.499
D.J. is going to be so furious.

09:01.583 --> 09:03.835
Oh. Please don't tell my mom.

09:03.918 --> 09:06.087
I've learned my lesson, Formando.

09:08.048 --> 09:11.217

and butchering my name.

09:14.471 --> 09:17.098
You're a Fuller.
You should know better than this.

Papa, didn't you always say
that it's better to call an adult

with some drunk kid?

I can't believe that Matt won.

10:00.391 --> 10:03.186
His clinic was only open
for, like, three weeks.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.188

Wait. What?

10:14.906 --> 10:16.324
He didn't even thank you.

10:16.407 --> 10:18.201
Oh, you guys are being ridiculous.

10:18.284 --> 10:21.412
He didn't thank a lot of people.
I'm sure he just forgot.

10:21.496 --> 10:23.790
He thanked his barista.

10:26.042 --> 10:29.212
Yeah, I know that barista, too.
He wrote "Schpepanie"<i></i>on my cup.

10:31.047 --> 10:34.300
I saw him wipe his brow with a biscotti,
and he still got thanked.

10:37.554 --> 10:39.055
-Little help here, please.
-Oh.

10:40.723 --> 10:42.308
[D.J.] Got to lift your foot.

10:45.520 --> 10:48.439
Wow. Kimmy, I think your foot is pregnant.

10:50.441 --> 10:54.445
You know what? Maybe you took
the actual Schpepanie's drink.

10:55.530 --> 10:58.116

now you're defending the barista.

Matt is not a better vet than you.

11:44.245 --> 11:47.373
I think there was a little payoff,
a little palm-schmearing.

11:48.625 --> 11:50.376
Who'd schmear for a BAASBA?

11:51.127 --> 11:54.464
Gia. She works in PR.
She knows how to schmear.

11:56.132 --> 11:57.967
Plus, she interned in a bagel shop.

11:59.761 --> 12:02.639
Oh, please. Nobody's schmearing anybody.

12:03.431 --> 12:05.767
And I'm glad.
At least one of us won, you know?

12:05.850 --> 12:07.101
It's good for the clinic.

12:07.936 --> 12:11.356
It's not like I made space on the mantle
for my BAASBA.

Everything is fine.

Why would you say otherwise?

12:28.748 --> 12:29.874
Is he acting strange?

12:31.793 --> 12:33.628
It's Fernando. Who can tell?

Didn't see you behind Matt's trophy,

was more than just a pretty face.

13:13.584 --> 13:17.922

and he totally deserves that award.

maybe she's  more comfortable
with an award-winning vet.

13:50.413 --> 13:52.790
I don't see your name on that banner.

13:55.084 --> 13:58.880
Yeah. Well, Janet, be a love
and bring me Truffle's chart.

13:58.963 --> 14:01.090
Anything for the Vet of the Year.

14:02.258 --> 14:05.136
Dr. Fuller, be a dear
and answer the phones.

14:06.137 --> 14:08.765
Hey, I am not answering the phone.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.850
[telephone rings]

14:17.648 --> 14:20.485
[Jamaican accent]
Harmon-Fuller Pet Care. Janet speaking.

14:22.487 --> 14:24.822
No, the Vet of the Year is booked.

14:25.948 --> 14:27.825
But you can see Dr. Fuller.

14:27.909 --> 14:32.080
She's very good and easy on the peepers.

14:33.748 --> 14:36.084
Hello? [normal voice] Hello?

14:52.517 --> 14:54.060
Did you know Truffles is a boy?

14:56.104 --> 14:57.563
I was not expecting that.

14:59.607 --> 15:00.983
Hey, where's my BAASBA?

15:02.360 --> 15:04.487
It was blocking the phone, so I moved it.

15:05.071 --> 15:08.324
Oh. Someone a little jealous?

15:10.118 --> 15:14.372
What? Why would I be jealous
of Vet of the Schmear?

15:16.666 --> 15:19.168
-What does that mean?
-You know what?

15:19.252 --> 15:22.839
Maybe we were naive to think we could
jump back into business together.

15:23.339 --> 15:25.425
Mm. Finally something that we agree on.

15:30.763 --> 15:31.973
Here's your BAASBA.

15:32.974 --> 15:34.559
You know where to put it.

15:38.980 --> 15:41.691
Hello, mommies and me.

15:41.774 --> 15:45.069
Well, I didn't get the... memo
on no yoga pants.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.866
Ladies, our daddy's back,
and it's a good thing,

15:49.949 --> 15:53.161
because I made you a moussaka.

15:53.244 --> 15:56.706
Aw, thanks, Renee. That's so sweet.
Becky and I never have time to cook.

15:56.789 --> 15:59.000
-That's so nice.
-Who's Becky?

16:01.085 --> 16:02.003
Still my wife.

16:03.212 --> 16:04.380
These are her pants.

16:08.551 --> 16:09.969
Lucky pants.

16:11.679 --> 16:12.972
-What'd you say?
-Nothing.

16:13.764 --> 16:16.350
Okay, everybody,
let's get into our activity circle.

16:16.434 --> 16:18.060
That means you, Zoe and Maya.

16:18.144 --> 16:20.271
Come on, everybody, activity circle.

16:20.396 --> 16:21.898
Okay. Today, we're going--

16:22.648 --> 16:26.694
Today, we're gonna work on our right
and our left with the Hokey Pokey.

16:26.777 --> 16:29.030
We love the Hokey Pokey, right?
Here we go.

Ho, I think you're using
the wrong hand.

16:37.955 --> 16:41.792
Oh, am I? I guess I don't know
my right from my wrong.

16:48.966 --> 16:50.551
Ho ho. Whoa.

16:51.844 --> 16:54.138
I was expecting more hokey and less pokey.

16:55.890 --> 16:58.142
All right, ladies, playtime's over. Out.

16:58.226 --> 17:00.436
But-- you heard the man, everybody out.

17:00.520 --> 17:03.564
Whoa, whoa. I'm talking to you,
Fatal Attraction.

17:05.942 --> 17:08.194
So does this mean
you don't want my moussaka?

17:09.820 --> 17:11.864
The only moussaka I want is Becky's.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.038
Mm-mmm.

17:23.084 --> 17:25.002
-[knock on door]
-Aah.

17:26.796 --> 17:29.131
Yeech, I hope you feel better
than you look.

17:30.841 --> 17:32.677
Can you please stop spinning my bed?

17:34.345 --> 17:38.307
I feel like I got off a Tilt-A-Whirl after
eating a churro dipped in clam sauce.

17:40.851 --> 17:44.939
You were really out of control last night.
You ran around the party naked.

17:47.024 --> 17:48.192
I did what?

17:49.485 --> 17:50.486
Okay, you didn't.

17:52.947 --> 17:55.741
But that was only because
I dragged you out of there.

17:55.825 --> 17:57.660
What was I supposed to do?

17:57.743 --> 18:01.289
You saw them. The whole football team
was chanting, "Chug, chug, chug."

18:01.372 --> 18:04.041
And I was chanting, "No, no, no."

18:04.834 --> 18:08.254
-I should've just walked away.
-Hey, don't beat yourself up.

18:09.422 --> 18:10.923
Now I gotta lie to my mom.

18:12.258 --> 18:17.138
If she finds out, she's gonna ground me,
like dig a hole and bury me under ground.

18:18.931 --> 18:21.350
And I need the sun.
I have seasonal sadness.

18:23.060 --> 18:24.061
<i>♪ Ooh-ooh-ooh ♪</i>

18:25.146 --> 18:28.065
I can't believe Matt.
You know, I can work with anyone.

18:28.149 --> 18:30.985
I'm fair, I'm honest, I'm giving.

18:35.156 --> 18:36.407
And calm.

18:38.659 --> 18:40.995
I just so misjudged his character.

18:41.078 --> 18:43.873
I am dismayed, disturbed,

18:43.956 --> 18:45.458
and dismayed.

18:47.793 --> 18:49.795
Because I can't think of another word.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.675
I am shocked by his behavior.

18:54.759 --> 18:57.470
I thought I really knew him,
but I guess I don't.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.639
I can't trust him ever again.

18:59.722 --> 19:02.933
I'm sorry. It's just
everyone on the team was yelling,

19:03.017 --> 19:04.977
"Chug, chug, chug, Golden Toe." So--

19:05.811 --> 19:09.148
I chugged a beer.
Or two, which is a lot less than...

19:10.608 --> 19:12.151
everyone else had.

19:19.450 --> 19:20.534
You drank beer?

19:20.993 --> 19:23.245
No, no. He chugged.
Weren't you listening?

19:27.083 --> 19:29.335
I can't believe you were drinking.

19:29.877 --> 19:31.921
Uh, Fernando didn't tell you?

19:32.588 --> 19:34.590
No, that's what [waves] meant.

19:36.926 --> 19:37.927
Fernando knew?

19:39.136 --> 19:42.139
Uh, yeah. He picked us up at the party.

19:42.473 --> 19:45.643
He wanted to tell you,
but Jackson begged him not to.

19:45.726 --> 19:48.145
Plus, my dad took really good care of him.

19:49.271 --> 19:53.776
Oh, I am so disappointed in you, Jackson.
This is exactly what I thought

19:53.859 --> 19:57.238
when you started hanging out with
those older football players.

19:57.321 --> 20:01.367
Mom, my head is pounding,
so, please, if you're gonna yell at me,

20:01.450 --> 20:02.451
yell at me quietly.

20:05.037 --> 20:07.206
-I'll deal with you later!
-Okay.

20:09.500 --> 20:10.751
Fernando.

20:13.879 --> 20:14.880
Fernando?

20:17.383 --> 20:19.301
Fernando can leave a room discreetly.

20:25.599 --> 20:26.809
Stop.

20:28.269 --> 20:30.271
Oh, hello, D.J.

20:31.647 --> 20:33.190
I was fleeing from your wrath.

20:34.734 --> 20:37.153
I figured by the time
you finished berating Jackson,

20:37.236 --> 20:38.612
I'd be across the bridge.

20:40.823 --> 20:43.909
You knew about my son drinking
and didn't tell me?

20:45.286 --> 20:47.663
Yes, but I made him a vow not to tell.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.623
But I'm Jackson's mother.

20:49.707 --> 20:52.501
It is my right to know
so I can parent him my way.

20:54.503 --> 20:55.796
Got to say, I agree.

20:57.840 --> 20:59.675
But then Jackson would not trust me.

20:59.759 --> 21:02.970
I want him to feel comfortable
so he can come to me in the future.

21:03.554 --> 21:04.930
He makes a good point, too.

21:06.891 --> 21:10.728
Oh, so in the future, Jackson can drink,
and you can keep it from me?

21:11.020 --> 21:13.439
No. He can come to me for other things.

21:14.690 --> 21:18.360
Not that there will be other things,
but there will be other things.

21:20.529 --> 21:23.783
Teenage boys don't always
want to confide in their mothers.

21:24.742 --> 21:26.202
Good points all around.

21:27.328 --> 21:29.413
This would make a great talk show.

21:30.623 --> 21:31.582
So keep talking.

21:34.668 --> 21:37.129
If Jackson didn't confess,
I would've never known.

21:37.880 --> 21:41.675
I was not trying to betray you, D.J.
I was just trying to help Jackson.

21:41.842 --> 21:43.135
He's like my family.

21:43.219 --> 21:45.429
-Jackson is my family.
-[cell phone ringtone]

21:48.724 --> 21:50.476
It's Matt. There's an emergency.

21:51.519 --> 21:54.980
Look, from now on,
just stay out of my parenting, okay?

21:57.817 --> 21:58.818
As you wish.

22:00.986 --> 22:02.321
[door closes]

22:08.410 --> 22:11.831
This is the after-party?
I don't see any mommies.

22:13.123 --> 22:16.043
Or mes. Or our daughter.

22:16.126 --> 22:19.630
She's with Stephanie.
Listen, Beck, full disclosure -

22:19.713 --> 22:21.841
one of the moms hit on me
during the Hokey Pokey.

22:21.924 --> 22:23.425
Is nothing sacred?

22:25.553 --> 22:26.679
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

22:26.762 --> 22:28.389
Let me guess.

22:28.472 --> 22:29.849
-Renee?
-Yes.

22:31.725 --> 22:36.063
You were right. I did sort of
really enjoy the mommy attention.

22:36.730 --> 22:39.733
But if I'm being honest,
I'd rather have it from you.

22:40.693 --> 22:41.861
Jess, I'm sorry.

22:42.903 --> 22:46.448
I think life has gotten so busy,
we forgot to make time for each other.

22:47.032 --> 22:49.577
-I miss you.
-I miss you, too.

22:50.327 --> 22:52.788
I can't remember the last time
we sat down and talked.

22:52.872 --> 22:55.291
I know. We're taking our relationship
for granted,

22:55.374 --> 22:58.127
but we've got to make time for each other.
And you know what?

22:58.210 --> 23:03.007
-Let's make a schedule right here and now.
-Okay, um, good idea.

23:03.090 --> 23:04.842
-Friday night is date night.
-Yes.

23:04.925 --> 23:07.887
-And Sunday morning, breakfast in bed.
-Yes.

23:07.970 --> 23:10.180
-Tuesdays, we can try those ballroom--
-No!

23:13.767 --> 23:15.352
I forgot how beautiful you are.

23:23.027 --> 23:24.278
Nothing? Nothing for me?

23:26.030 --> 23:27.448
I forgot how needy you are.

23:28.824 --> 23:30.200
How could you forget that?

23:31.327 --> 23:36.206
If haven't told you lately, I think
you're the most handsome man in the world.

23:36.540 --> 23:40.419
Really? You're not just saying that
because I am handsome?

23:47.718 --> 23:49.929
Are you in the mood
for a little Hokey Pokey?

23:52.640 --> 23:54.266
I could shake it all about, sure.

23:55.893 --> 23:58.771
Hey, uh... are those my yoga pants?

24:01.440 --> 24:03.776
Don't question. Just enjoy.

24:05.319 --> 24:08.697
Didn't we talk about you
wearing my clothes outside of the house?

24:09.406 --> 24:11.116
You said nothing about yoga pants.

24:17.748 --> 24:21.001
Oh, Shelliot's listless.
His eyelids are swollen.

24:24.254 --> 24:26.006
He'll need a drip and a shot of "A."

24:27.216 --> 24:29.426
Would the Vet of the Year mind if I do it?

24:29.510 --> 24:31.679
Please. You are the reptile expert.

24:32.429 --> 24:33.389
Am I?

24:33.472 --> 24:37.559
And cats, and dogs, and asses.

24:39.561 --> 24:40.854
Which I was.

24:42.773 --> 24:44.358
D.J., I am really sorry.

24:44.441 --> 24:48.737
That silly award
made me feel better about myself,

24:49.071 --> 24:52.491
but you are the amazing vet;
I always feel like I'm in your shadow.

24:52.574 --> 24:57.538
Matt, I wouldn't be partners with you
if I didn't think you are a great vet.

24:59.164 --> 25:01.333
And thank you for calling me
about Shelliot.

25:02.251 --> 25:05.129
Yeah, well, what matters
is that Shelliot is okay.

25:07.589 --> 25:10.009
Oh, my land animal.

25:12.720 --> 25:15.180
What matters is that SheIliot's okay,

25:15.514 --> 25:18.851
not who he confided in
or who picked him up from the party.

25:19.601 --> 25:21.020
I'm not following.

25:23.230 --> 25:25.441
Matt, this tortoise is a teenager now,

25:25.733 --> 25:29.028
and he has questions
and anxiety about girls

25:29.236 --> 25:33.615
and SATs and body hair
and... he needs all of our help.

25:34.074 --> 25:36.618
Wow, I still have a lot to learn
about tortoises.

25:38.620 --> 25:40.873
-You've got this, right?
-Yeah.

25:45.711 --> 25:47.379

25:53.010 --> 25:55.095
D.J., I have left your house.

25:55.179 --> 25:59.224
You did not ask me to, but I felt it was
strictly an oversight on your part.

26:00.350 --> 26:04.438
Actually, I'm glad that you're here.
See, the turtle was fine

26:04.521 --> 26:08.025
because the right person
treated his hypovitaminosis.

26:08.776 --> 26:12.821
I do not understand your turtle metaphors,
but I assume you're apologizing?

26:15.240 --> 26:17.284
Thank you for taking care of Jackson.

26:19.369 --> 26:21.997
Fernando, being the mother
of a high-schooler is...

26:23.123 --> 26:25.292
really hard and scary.

26:27.044 --> 26:28.796
But I am glad that Jackson has you.

26:29.630 --> 26:31.799
You know,
when he doesn't wanna talk to me.

26:32.633 --> 26:34.551
I know you'll always be there for him.

26:37.221 --> 26:40.015
Do not make me cry, D.J. Do not do it.

26:41.391 --> 26:45.729
I trust you,
and I'm sorry that I ever doubted you.

26:46.480 --> 26:47.773
You're doing it.

26:49.233 --> 26:50.400
But I'm holding it in.

26:51.443 --> 26:53.695
Aw, you're a good man, Fernando.

26:54.446 --> 26:56.615
And I love you like family.

Here come the waterworks.

27:03.288 --> 27:05.165
Aw, now you're getting me started.

27:10.003 --> 27:11.004
Oh, dear.

27:13.674 --> 27:17.719
Max, if you're ever in trouble
and you don't wanna call me,

27:17.803 --> 27:20.514
just know that Fernando
will always be there for you.

27:21.890 --> 27:24.560
Uh, I can get my Zappos package later.

27:28.522 --> 27:31.150
Okay, so, in the future,
here's what you're gonna do.

27:31.233 --> 27:32.609
I'm gonna be in the future?

27:39.032 --> 27:42.035
You wake up, you're hung over,
you're put on some sunglasses,

27:42.119 --> 27:44.621
hightail it to Denny's
and get a pot of coffee.

27:44.705 --> 27:46.540
That'll cure the pounding headache?

27:46.623 --> 27:48.125
Well, it'll help, but mostly,

27:48.208 --> 27:50.669
you'll not be stuck at home
talking to your mom.

27:53.922 --> 27:54.923
Good luck, Jackson.

27:58.302 --> 27:59.386
Here it is, Jackson.

28:00.596 --> 28:03.557
Sit down. I can't discipline you
when you're taller than me.

28:09.938 --> 28:12.065
You're grounded for two weeks.

28:12.149 --> 28:16.069
And no cell phone, no <i>Fortnite,</i>
no devices, nothing.

28:17.613 --> 28:21.950
I trusted you, you betrayed my trust,
It's gonna take a while to earn it back.

28:23.160 --> 28:25.662
Jackson, I'm not naive.
I was a teenager, too.

28:27.331 --> 28:28.707
Well, Stephanie was.

28:34.254 --> 28:35.631
I just have to ask.

28:36.673 --> 28:38.675
Why did you call Fernando and not me?

28:39.927 --> 28:40.928
Honestly...

28:42.179 --> 28:43.805
I didn't wanna disappoint you.

28:45.891 --> 28:47.309
Well, unfortunately you did.

28:48.518 --> 28:52.105
Look, I know that there are gonna be
certain guy issues

28:52.189 --> 28:55.317
you're not gonna feel comfortable
talking to me about, but

28:55.400 --> 28:59.196
that doesn't excuse the fact
that you made a very poor choice.

29:00.030 --> 29:01.490
I know, Mom, I know.

29:01.949 --> 29:04.409
You cannot be drinking at your age.

29:04.701 --> 29:07.704
It's illegal, and it's dangerous.

29:08.580 --> 29:12.918
I know it's gonna be hard for you
because your friends will be doing it,

29:13.001 --> 29:15.379
but I expect you to be stronger than that.

29:15.754 --> 29:18.799
And I'm telling you these things
because I love you.

29:18.882 --> 29:22.219
Okay?
And I want you to live a very long life.

29:23.804 --> 29:25.430
I love you, too, Mom.

29:29.768 --> 29:33.313
Hey, uh, I know I'm grounded,
but can we go to Denny's?

29:42.406 --> 29:43.532
Denny's? Why?

29:43.615 --> 29:46.576
Oh, well, Stephanie said it was
the best hangover cure.

29:49.037 --> 29:50.038
Did she now?

29:55.043 --> 29:56.044
Schpepanie?
