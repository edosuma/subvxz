WEBVTT

00:03.717 --> 00:07.304
- Peter Parker. Are you Spider-Man?
- No!

00:07.471 --> 00:11.058
- For the Godzillionth time, no.
- That guy in black said different.

00:11.225 --> 00:13.018
You mean the guy calling
himself Venom?

00:13.185 --> 00:14.520
Does that name inspire trust?

00:14.686 --> 00:17.064
Then how is it you're the only
photographer getting pictures...

00:17.231 --> 00:18.524
...of the web-slinger in action?

00:18.690 --> 00:23.028
Look, he rings my cell to tip me off
when he's about to fight a baddie.

00:23.195 --> 00:25.864
- Guy's kind of a glory hound.
- I knew it!

00:26.031 --> 00:29.368
I knew that headline hog
was using me for free publicity!

00:29.535 --> 00:30.619
But a buck's a buck.

00:30.786 --> 00:33.914
So, Lee, interview everyone
that wall-crawling weasel's ever met.

00:34.081 --> 00:36.083
Heck, interview everyone,
Parker's ever met!

00:36.250 --> 00:37.876
- I'm on it.
- Wait.

00:38.043 --> 00:39.962
- You can't really think--
- Go home, Peter.

00:40.128 --> 00:42.089
Get a good night's sleep.

00:42.631 --> 00:45.801
<i>With my world about to end?
Sure.</i>

00:45.968 --> 00:49.638
- Well?
- He's a kid, not Spider-Man.

00:49.805 --> 00:53.850
Yeah. Butjust in case...

00:54.226 --> 00:55.769
We're ready to run with this.

02:04.796 --> 02:07.758
You were one of the first individuals
rescued by the Spider-Man.

02:07.924 --> 02:09.884
And Peter Parker
is a friend of your son's.

02:10.051 --> 02:13.472
Any chance Pete and Spidey
are one and the same?

02:15.515 --> 02:17.225
No.

02:20.187 --> 02:21.688
Pete.

02:21.855 --> 02:24.941
A Bugle reporter asked
my dad if you're Spider-Man.

02:25.108 --> 02:27.861
- Come on, what's that about?
- Nothing!

02:28.028 --> 02:30.072
I mean, no idea.

02:30.238 --> 02:32.783
Sha Shan. Hey.

02:33.533 --> 02:34.826
Wait up!

02:37.746 --> 02:39.873
Really, Flash, there's no point.

02:40.040 --> 02:42.834
I'm not going outwith you.

02:45.379 --> 02:48.757
Yo! Mr. Devereaux!

02:48.924 --> 02:50.008
Yo.

02:50.175 --> 02:54.304
Okay, so you didn't cast me
in the school play. No hard feelings.

02:54.471 --> 02:59.893
But guy to guy, a part would really
get me in good with a certain girl, see'?

03:00.769 --> 03:02.270
I see.

03:02.437 --> 03:09.027
Unfortunately, I'm directing a play,
not managing a dating service.

03:12.572 --> 03:15.117
If this special seminar
teaches you kids anything...

03:15.283 --> 03:17.202
...at least you'll
learn the importance...

03:17.369 --> 03:20.539
...of keeping your personal
information private.

03:23.834 --> 03:26.878
Yes, Mr. Brown? A question?

03:27.045 --> 03:29.548
Guess it will have to wait
till next week.

03:45.355 --> 03:47.733
Peter Parker? Spider-Man?

03:50.694 --> 03:53.363
- That's...
- You have got to be kidding.

03:55.824 --> 03:59.578
Although, it would
explain a few things.

03:59.745 --> 04:01.204
- Like when--
- You don't mean--

04:01.371 --> 04:03.790
- And what about--?
- That's pretty far-fetched.

04:03.957 --> 04:06.585
- And yet, no comment.
- No comment.

04:14.176 --> 04:17.471
Ladies and gentlemen,
the prodigal son returns.

04:18.012 --> 04:19.973
Eddie?

04:22.684 --> 04:25.353
- Great to see you again.
- Where have you been, mister?

04:25.520 --> 04:28.690
Took some downtime
after the downsizing.

04:28.857 --> 04:31.485
Eddie, what really happened?

04:31.651 --> 04:34.529
You were right behind me
when that monster grabbed me.

04:34.696 --> 04:37.324
- I was afraid you--
- Why don't we catch up over coffee...

04:37.491 --> 04:39.075
-...just the two of us.
- No.

04:39.576 --> 04:41.578
I mean,
Gwen and I promised to meet...

04:41.745 --> 04:44.706
...Harry and Liz
at the Silver Spoon, like, now.

04:44.873 --> 04:46.041
Rain cheque then.

04:46.208 --> 04:48.877
Don't suppose
you'd like your job back?

04:49.044 --> 04:51.546
You kidding? Just give us a minute.

04:51.713 --> 04:54.216
Been so missing my bro.

04:54.382 --> 04:56.843
We're quite unimpressed
with the Bugle.

04:57.010 --> 05:01.556
They haven't run
our big scoop yet, so...

05:01.723 --> 05:06.102
I don't really care what impresses
you these days, bro.

05:09.231 --> 05:11.733
But you will.

05:11.900 --> 05:14.778
- So bus or subway--
- There he is.

05:14.945 --> 05:16.446
- Hey, smile, Spidey.
- Is it true?

05:16.613 --> 05:18.907
- Are you Spider-Man?
- Hey, sling us a web, Pete.

05:19.074 --> 05:21.868
They think you're Spider-Man?

05:23.245 --> 05:25.330
- I'm sorry.
- Can you prove you're not Spidey?

05:25.497 --> 05:26.915
He)', Spidey, that your girl?

05:27.082 --> 05:29.292
Yo, babe, what's it
like kissing a freak?

05:29.459 --> 05:31.837
- Let go of me.
- Back off.

05:32.003 --> 05:34.714
Hey, come on.
Just a few more shots.

05:34.881 --> 05:35.924
This way.

05:36.091 --> 05:37.384
Hey, we might catch
him webbing away.

05:37.551 --> 05:38.718
Hey! Where'd they go?

05:38.885 --> 05:41.054
- I know they came this way.
- Keep looking.

05:41.596 --> 05:43.849
They can't have gotten far.

05:44.307 --> 05:47.310
Hey, does Spidey do invisible?

05:48.687 --> 05:50.564
Maybe they went
in the student store.

05:50.730 --> 05:53.608
- Yeah.
- Or the swim gym.

06:02.409 --> 06:05.287
Hello? Hey, Harry.

06:05.745 --> 06:07.038
Liz is there too?

06:07.205 --> 06:10.041
Yeah, sure, sure,
we'll be there in a few minutes.

06:10.208 --> 06:11.835
Bye.

06:12.002 --> 06:13.503
I think they're gone.

06:13.670 --> 06:19.259
But given the circumstances,
I'd better pass on the Spoon.

06:19.426 --> 06:23.763
Tell Liz that I'm sorry.
And Harry.

06:23.930 --> 06:28.476
Yeah, me too. I mean, I will.

06:45.285 --> 06:47.120
Bro, I get why you're doing
this to me...

06:47.287 --> 06:49.247
...but don't you get how many
other people you'll hurt?

06:49.915 --> 06:54.669
We know exactly how many people
your secrets will hurt.

07:01.593 --> 07:05.597
And we can't wait to watch them
all turn against you.

07:31.289 --> 07:33.416
- Who are you?
- How many Spideys are there?

07:33.583 --> 07:37.128
- What are you doing to him?
- Call us Venom.

07:37.295 --> 07:42.968
And all we want is to take off
Spider-Man's mask.

07:45.303 --> 07:49.474
Is your nephew Spider-Man?

07:51.142 --> 07:52.978
Am I being punked?

07:53.979 --> 07:58.149
- And now, the moment of truth.
- Sure.

07:58.316 --> 08:00.485
What say we get a close-up?

08:05.490 --> 08:06.825
That proves it.

08:06.992 --> 08:10.495
If he wasn't Parker,
would he resist this much?

08:10.662 --> 08:11.788
Hey, the creep's got a point.

08:11.955 --> 08:14.082
- Yeah, show us your face.
- Prove you're not Parker.

08:14.249 --> 08:15.959
Come on.
Just because I'm not Parker...

08:16.126 --> 08:18.753
...doesn't mean I'll reveal who I am.
It's called a secret identity.

08:23.049 --> 08:25.093
Besides, Smiley here's
a half-alien Symbiote!

08:25.260 --> 08:26.886
You can't trust those things.

08:27.053 --> 08:31.766
The spider doth protest
too much, we thinks.

08:34.269 --> 08:37.856
Whoops, too hard.
But stay tuned.

08:38.023 --> 08:41.650
We'll be right back
with the unmasking!

08:45.697 --> 08:48.867
All right, all right,
leave the boy alone.

08:49.034 --> 08:51.161
There he is.
Do you think he's really Spidey?

08:51.327 --> 08:53.371
No, I do not.

08:59.252 --> 09:02.922
Perfect. Like you never left.

09:10.305 --> 09:12.515
Good to be home.

09:13.683 --> 09:17.270
Look, I've known Puny Parker
since nursery school.

09:17.437 --> 09:20.148
Man, the dweeb spent sophomore year
stuffed in his locker.

09:20.315 --> 09:23.234
Several students saw him
in a Spider-Man costume.

09:23.401 --> 09:25.278
At the Halloween carnival.

09:25.445 --> 09:27.906
And he looked like a geek
in footie pyjamas!

09:28.073 --> 09:31.993
Anyone can suit up
and pretend to be Spidey.

09:33.411 --> 09:35.580
And I can prove it.

09:37.749 --> 09:39.959
Hey, news losers. Here I am.

09:40.126 --> 09:41.711
- There he is.
- What's with the crutches?

09:41.878 --> 09:43.588
Maybe that Venom injured him.

09:43.755 --> 09:46.382
I'm ready to reveal
my true identity as...

09:46.549 --> 09:48.051
Not Parker.

09:48.426 --> 09:51.137
Hey, hey.
web-head walking here.

09:51.304 --> 09:55.475
- You thinking what I'm thinking?
- Yeah. Spidey's gimped up.

09:55.642 --> 09:58.186
We'll never have a better chance
to take him down.

10:02.315 --> 10:03.942
<i>Every time I swear
I'm not Spidey...</i>

10:04.109 --> 10:06.319
<i>...I'm lying to people
I care about.</i>

10:06.486 --> 10:09.531
<i>Maybe I should just admit the truth.</i>

10:16.037 --> 10:18.998
You've fought Spidey.
Any insight on his identity?

10:19.165 --> 10:22.252
Nah, but I hope the Parker kid
is Spider-Man.

10:22.418 --> 10:28.716
Believe me, every guy in the joint
would know what to do with that info.

10:29.634 --> 10:31.094
Back off!

10:35.265 --> 10:37.934
Should've stood in bed,
web-stinker.

10:39.936 --> 10:42.689
Web-stinker? Really?
That's your A material?

10:43.439 --> 10:46.568
This guy's a fake.
That's the real Spidey.

10:47.152 --> 10:49.445
The brains of the outfit.

10:50.113 --> 10:51.281
Hold this for me, genius.

10:52.198 --> 10:53.783
Hey!

11:03.710 --> 11:05.420
Man.

11:07.797 --> 11:10.258
See? Anyone can pretend
to be Spidey...

11:10.425 --> 11:11.885
...and you guys will eat it up.

11:12.051 --> 11:14.387
But there's only one genuine article.

11:14.554 --> 11:18.349
- You mean Peter Parker?
- Yeah. No! This guy!

11:18.516 --> 11:21.811
He's my biggest fan.
Which is sad, really.

11:21.978 --> 11:23.521
We'll show you sad.

11:27.275 --> 11:31.321
A sad little masked superhero...

11:31.487 --> 11:35.950
...soon to have no mask
and no super.

11:36.117 --> 11:39.787
Recognise this? Gene cleanser.

11:39.954 --> 11:44.918
After your identity's revealed,
we'll pour it down your throat.

11:45.084 --> 11:47.295
Then we'll sit back and laugh...

11:47.462 --> 11:52.008
...while all your enemies
attack Peter Parker.

11:53.092 --> 11:56.971
Leaving you powerless
to defend yourself...

11:57.138 --> 11:59.515
...or the ones you love.

12:03.019 --> 12:05.772
So they tell me you and Pete
go way back.

12:05.939 --> 12:08.650
Yeah, we're like brothers.

12:08.816 --> 12:14.906
Should've seen it sooner,
Peter Parker is Spider-Man.

12:26.751 --> 12:28.711
This is gold.

13:23.141 --> 13:25.476
What are those supposed to do?

13:25.643 --> 13:30.023
- Well, they're supposed to hurt.
- Right idea. Wrong calibre.

14:34.170 --> 14:35.421
No.

14:35.588 --> 14:37.048
Well, well.

14:37.590 --> 14:40.301
All our favourite playthings
are here.

14:45.181 --> 14:48.518
- One word, evacuate!
- Move along, girls.

14:49.310 --> 14:50.353
Now, Miss Stacy.

14:54.816 --> 14:56.567
Tasty.

15:30.518 --> 15:32.478
Proceed quickly.

15:40.361 --> 15:43.197
You really think you can hurt
us with that?

15:43.364 --> 15:44.574
Kind of.

15:54.167 --> 15:57.962
That was unpleasant.

15:58.129 --> 15:59.422
<i>Oh, great. Now he's mad.</i>

16:07.180 --> 16:08.973
Thanks. I'll get out of your way now.

16:51.933 --> 16:54.519
You never could score a basket
to save your life.

16:54.685 --> 16:56.187
Just not used to being the ball.

16:59.857 --> 17:03.945
Stupid reporters still think
Puny Parker's Spidey.

17:15.998 --> 17:18.960
Open wide.

17:19.710 --> 17:21.337
Don't be a baby.

17:21.503 --> 17:23.964
It's time to take your medicine.

17:24.131 --> 17:27.260
Hey, dufus!
You got the wrong spider!

17:27.425 --> 17:29.387
Please, you're not fooling--

17:33.516 --> 17:37.353
- Thanks. You did good. Now, book.
- Right. Booking.

17:40.690 --> 17:43.859
We'll take that cleanser now.

17:44.026 --> 17:45.987
Whatever you say, bro.

18:09.135 --> 18:10.177
No!

18:15.600 --> 18:18.311
You can't reject me now.

18:30.698 --> 18:32.325
Don't leave me.

18:36.621 --> 18:37.663
It got away.

18:39.457 --> 18:42.043
Help me get it back. Please!

18:42.209 --> 18:44.211
Eddie, Eddie, it's over.

18:44.378 --> 18:46.505
You're free. You can stop this.

18:46.672 --> 18:50.009
- Stop hating.
- Can't.

18:50.676 --> 18:55.598
It only loves me for the hate.

19:02.146 --> 19:04.231
It'll come back.

19:04.398 --> 19:07.818
You'll see. We're Venom!

19:07.985 --> 19:11.864
- And we'll destroy Spider-Man yet!
- Brock's lost it.

19:12.031 --> 19:13.949
Venom's like twice his size.

19:14.116 --> 19:15.159
Hey, did I mention...

19:15.326 --> 19:17.995
...I received a personal thank you
from Spidey himself?

19:18.162 --> 19:20.039
- You mean, Pete?
- Yeah. No.

19:20.206 --> 19:21.415
Mr. Thompson.

19:21.582 --> 19:23.959
I was having a spot of tea
in the faculty lounge...

19:24.126 --> 19:25.961
...when who should appear
on the telly...

19:26.128 --> 19:30.216
...but a young man in a spidery
sort of costume and crutches.

19:32.009 --> 19:34.845
- Yeah?
- I had no idea...

19:35.012 --> 19:39.642
...you had such hidden talents.
So I have reconsidered your request.

19:39.809 --> 19:44.355
I'd like to offer you the part
of Nick Bottom in our play.

19:44.522 --> 19:46.691
Nick? He's the hero, right?

19:46.857 --> 19:49.777
Oh, he's quite essential, to be sure.

19:49.944 --> 19:53.155
Coach, you got yourself a star.

19:54.281 --> 19:58.703
So maybe now, we can score
some private rehearsal time.

19:58.869 --> 20:01.539
I don't think you'll be needing
much rehearsal.

20:01.706 --> 20:05.710
<i>You just agreed</i> to <i>play Nick Bottom
in A Midsummer Night's Dream.</i>

20:05.876 --> 20:08.337
Trust me, you have that role nailed.

20:09.130 --> 20:11.215
You know I do.

20:15.052 --> 20:16.929
We're missing
a vial of gene cleanser.

20:18.222 --> 20:21.851
I feel I have no choice.
Security has been...

20:22.017 --> 20:24.520
Well, abysmal under your watch.

20:24.687 --> 20:26.272
I'm asking the university board...

20:26.439 --> 20:28.983
...to turn over day-to-day
management of the lab to me.

20:29.150 --> 20:30.985
But Curt built this lab.

20:31.152 --> 20:33.696
- You can't--
- I'm sorry. But I can.

20:38.409 --> 20:40.286
I just have two questions
for you, Betty.

20:40.453 --> 20:42.371
Do you think Peter Parker
is Spider-Man?

20:42.538 --> 20:45.875
And would you go outwith me
Saturday night?

20:46.041 --> 20:47.877
Lee! You've got
exactly eight seconds...

20:48.043 --> 20:49.503
...to show me what you've got
on the web-head!

20:50.337 --> 20:53.257
So that Thompson kid told me about
Pete being at the Halloween carnival.

20:53.424 --> 20:56.093
So I dug up the security footage.
Okay, pause.

20:56.260 --> 20:57.845
This is where the rumour
must have started...

20:58.012 --> 20:59.847
...but come on.
I mean, would the real Spidey...

21:00.014 --> 21:02.308
-...ever show his face in public?
- Thank you.

21:02.808 --> 21:07.605
<i>And thank you, Flash.
That's two I owe you.</i>

21:13.444 --> 21:17.823
<i>Innocent, but still at large.
Guess you can't win them all.</i>

21:28.209 --> 21:32.588
I once thought his whole masked
vigilante thing was problematic.

21:32.755 --> 21:34.006
But I've come to realise...

21:34.173 --> 21:36.926
...that if Spider-Man's true identity
was revealed...

21:37.092 --> 21:40.596
...everyone he cared about
would be in constant danger.

21:40.763 --> 21:43.808
Maybe a man in a mask
doesn't have something to hide...

21:43.974 --> 21:46.268
...but something to protect.

21:46.435 --> 21:47.686
Wouldn't you agree?

21:49.980 --> 21:51.023
Yes, sir.
