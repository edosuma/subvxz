[Crying]

20:14.053 --> 20:15.442
Why?!

20:15.443 --> 20:18.106
No! [Sobbing]

20:18.129 --> 20:19.899
- Eh, sorry, Pork.

20:26.740 --> 20:29.042
- W-would you like to dance?

20:29.110 --> 20:31.010
- [High-pitched voice] I'd l-love to.

20:31.078 --> 20:33.713
[Giggling]

20:39.186 --> 20:40.520
- Lola?

20:40.588 --> 20:41.853
- Hi, Bugs!

20:41.869 --> 20:42.549
Oof!

20:42.550 --> 20:43.189
[Thud]

20:47.461 --> 20:49.606
I'm OK.

20:49.607 --> 20:51.343
The cupcake broke my fall.

20:51.398 --> 20:52.367
Mm.

20:52.368 --> 20:53.437
It's still good.

21:00.241 --> 21:03.309
- Here you go,
your new business cards.

21:06.313 --> 21:09.977
It pretty cool to be dating
a licensed cosmetologist.

21:10.008 --> 21:12.206
- Well, it's pretty cool
for me to be dating

21:12.214 --> 21:14.854
the Junior Assistant
Manager of Copy Place.

21:14.922 --> 21:17.466
Doesn't quite roll off the tongue

21:17.497 --> 21:20.960
like "Licensed
cosmetologist," does it?

21:29.436 --> 21:31.371
- OK, can I get you anything else?

21:31.438 --> 21:34.207
- Nah, we're good.

21:34.275 --> 21:36.298
- More iced tea...

21:36.299 --> 21:37.478
For the lady?

21:37.501 --> 21:40.213
[Laughing]

21:40.281 --> 21:42.782
I miss her so much.

21:42.850 --> 21:43.804
- Hi, guys.

21:43.805 --> 21:45.318
This is my friend Nancy.

21:45.386 --> 21:47.487
- Nice to meet you.

21:49.323 --> 21:50.339
- Call me

21:50.340 --> 21:52.091

21:52.159 --> 21:54.327
Do something with that.
