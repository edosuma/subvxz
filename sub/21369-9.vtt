00:06.120 --> 00:07.170
Raven:
Raven's Home was filmed

00:07.170 --> 00:09.380
in front
of a live studio audience.

00:09.380 --> 00:11.120
Levi:
Hey, Tess.
Bad news.

00:11.120 --> 00:12.620
Looks like we're taking
the bus home.

00:12.620 --> 00:15.500
Yeah.
Aunt Chelsea's at the dentist,
and my mom's at work

00:15.500 --> 00:18.830
wondering...
where it all went wrong.

00:18.830 --> 00:21.000
Yeah, you guys head
on home without me.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.420
You know, since Nia's
out of town, I'm gonna
hang back

00:23.420 --> 00:24.920
and shoot some hoops.

00:24.920 --> 00:26.880
-With who?
-Just a bunch of random kids
from other schools.

00:26.880 --> 00:28.250
No one special.
You wouldn't know them.

00:28.250 --> 00:30.750
Why are you asking
so many questions?

00:30.750 --> 00:33.120
Whoa, take it easy.

00:33.120 --> 00:35.000
Hey, if you're gonna
shoot some hoops,

00:35.000 --> 00:37.250
we'll play, too.
Levi, you in?

00:37.250 --> 00:39.420
Oh, no.

00:39.420 --> 00:42.500
I avoid balls and gyms
at all costs.

00:42.500 --> 00:43.670
We have history.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.830
Sorry, Booker,
you can't come.

00:46.830 --> 00:49.500
-Why not?
-'Cause we're afraid
you'll dominate.

00:49.500 --> 00:51.750
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, we're afraid
of you raw talent.

00:51.750 --> 00:52.880
Later!

00:54.460 --> 00:56.210
Was Tess acting weird?

00:56.210 --> 00:58.420
Nah, makes perfect sense.

00:58.420 --> 01:02.380
I mean, even kids
at other schools
know about my game.

01:02.380 --> 01:04.710
I'm just too good.

Ladies and ladies,
prepare yourself
for the Amazing Levi!

02:04.290 --> 02:05.670
Chelsea:
Ohh!

02:05.670 --> 02:09.330
Thank you.
And a hand
for my assistant, Booker.

02:09.330 --> 02:11.500
(clearing throat)

02:12.540 --> 02:14.460
My lovely assistant, Booker.

02:14.460 --> 02:16.500
(applauding)

02:16.500 --> 02:20.750
Behold!
An ordinary grapefruit.

02:20.750 --> 02:24.420
I will now... (struggling)
make it...

02:26.500 --> 02:29.210
disappear.

02:29.210 --> 02:36.170
I wave my magic wand
and say "magic words
of your choice"!

02:38.080 --> 02:40.880
And the grapefruit is gone.

02:40.880 --> 02:42.040
Chelsea:
Ooh.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.330
(Chelsea gasps)

02:48.250 --> 02:49.580
Oh, sweetheart,
that was a great trick.

02:51.380 --> 02:53.580
All I did was make
grapefruit juice.

02:53.580 --> 02:56.210
Yeah, well,
magical grapefruit juice.

02:57.460 --> 02:59.620
Hey, why don't make
a magic paper towel appear

02:59.620 --> 03:01.000
and clean up my coffee table.

03:02.380 --> 03:04.620
No, I'll get it for you.

03:04.620 --> 03:07.790
It's kind of my job.
I am his lovely assistant.

03:13.080 --> 03:14.750
Booker?
Are you okay?

03:14.750 --> 03:16.580
Yeah, he's probably
just in shock

03:16.580 --> 03:18.710
that he actually volunteered
to clean somethin' up.

03:18.710 --> 03:21.250
(Chelsea and Raven laugh)

03:22.500 --> 03:24.830
That was funny, right?

03:24.830 --> 03:28.500
Oh-- No, I was-- I was
actually laughing
at something else.

03:28.500 --> 03:31.460
-(laughs)
-It was still funny, though.

03:33.290 --> 03:35.500
Booker!
Did you just have a vision?

03:35.500 --> 03:36.790
Yeah, did my mom notice?

03:36.790 --> 03:39.080
Nah, she was pretty
into her own joke.

03:40.380 --> 03:42.380
So what'd you see
that was so funny?

03:42.380 --> 03:45.620
It was Tess coming home
from basketball today.

03:45.620 --> 03:47.620
I-- I can't-- I can't,
you gotta see it for yourself.

03:50.620 --> 03:52.920
Shh!
This is it, get ready.

03:53.920 --> 03:56.120
I don't know,
it might be me,

03:56.120 --> 03:58.670
but your cheek
this close to my cheek,

03:58.670 --> 04:00.250
(whispers)
just feels right.

04:00.250 --> 04:04.620
-(both laughing)
-That was it.
That was my vision.

04:04.620 --> 04:05.920
What are you guys doing?

04:05.920 --> 04:08.040
Watching you snuggle
with your basketball.

04:08.040 --> 04:11.670
I wasn't snuggling,
I was checking the air pressure.

04:11.670 --> 04:13.210
Yeah, it's low.

04:14.880 --> 04:20.040
It was funny in my vision,
and even funnier in person.

04:20.040 --> 04:23.670
So, who's the lucky basketball?

04:23.670 --> 04:24.620
Nobody!

04:24.620 --> 04:28.210
I can't believe you used
your visions to spy on me!

04:28.210 --> 04:31.540
It wasn't on purpose.
You know I can't
control my power.

04:31.540 --> 04:34.170
-Maybe you should learn.
-What are you getting
so upset about?

04:34.170 --> 04:35.580
It's none of your business.

04:35.580 --> 04:37.880
Just keep your visions
out of my life, okay?

04:41.210 --> 04:43.670
Man, she was mad!

04:43.670 --> 04:47.380
Yeah.
That basketball's gonna
get an earful.

04:54.750 --> 04:56.120
-Morning, Rae.
-Hey.

04:56.120 --> 04:57.460
You makin' Booker's lunch?

04:57.460 --> 04:59.670
Oh, what gave it away,
the bread, the peanut butter,

04:59.670 --> 05:01.710
or the fact that I do this
every single day?

05:02.620 --> 05:04.540
Gosh, I think it's the bread.

05:06.120 --> 05:09.880
Man, I can't believe Booker
eats a PB and J sandwich
every day.

05:09.880 --> 05:11.290
You'd think he want
some variety.

05:11.290 --> 05:12.580
Oh no, no, no,
I switch it up.

05:12.580 --> 05:14.790
Now sometimes he gets creamy,
sometimes he gets chunky,

05:14.790 --> 05:17.080
and sometimes he gets
like two dollars 'cause
I oversleep.

05:18.330 --> 05:20.960
Man, I wish I could give Levi
the same thing every day.

05:20.960 --> 05:24.250
Oh, you can.
You just have to stop askin' him
what he wants.

05:24.250 --> 05:28.620
Yeah, but I think it's important
to, you know, give Levi
the freedom to choose.

05:28.620 --> 05:31.290
Really show him I care.

05:31.290 --> 05:32.580
Are you saying I don't care?

05:32.580 --> 05:33.710
Of course not, Rae.

05:33.710 --> 05:35.620
-Oh.
-Morning.

05:35.620 --> 05:39.670
Well, there's
the most talented magician
in the whole wide world.

05:39.670 --> 05:41.080
Did we watch
the same trick?

05:42.710 --> 05:44.580
Honey, what's wrong?

05:44.580 --> 05:46.080
I can't make my trick work.

05:46.080 --> 05:47.500
What are you talking about?

05:47.500 --> 05:51.000
You made a wonderful,
flat grapefruit.

05:52.170 --> 05:54.250
It was supposed
to disappear.

05:54.250 --> 05:55.710
I'm never gonna
get this right.

05:55.710 --> 05:59.830
Honey, yes, you will.
It just takes practice.

05:59.830 --> 06:01.420
Why don't you go
get dressed for school, hm?

06:01.420 --> 06:02.460
In a minute, Mom.

06:03.710 --> 06:06.620
-Wow.
-Oh. Okay, honey,

06:06.620 --> 06:08.620
just pack up your stuff,
and then do what Mommy said.

06:08.620 --> 06:12.330
-I said in a minute.
-Ooh. He said.

06:14.330 --> 06:17.880
Just one minute,
and then that's it, okay?

06:17.880 --> 06:20.290
Rae, can you just
keep out of it?

06:20.290 --> 06:21.380
It's fine.

06:22.750 --> 06:26.250
Levi, Levi, now your mama
told you to put the magic trick
down and go do

06:26.250 --> 06:28.920
what you gotta do.
Listen to your Mom.
I'm not gonna tell you again.

06:28.920 --> 06:31.290
-Okay, Auntie Rae.
-All right.
Good job.

06:31.290 --> 06:35.170
(clears throat)
I know what you're thinking,
and you're welcome.

06:42.920 --> 06:45.710
Six in a row?
You're on fire!

06:45.710 --> 06:47.540
Ha! That was nothing.

06:49.210 --> 06:51.580
Booker, what are we
doing here?

06:51.580 --> 06:55.960
Look, Tess has a crush
on somebody, and I wanna
find out who it is.

06:55.960 --> 06:58.380
But she told us
not to spy on her.

06:58.380 --> 07:02.170
What? Pfft! No!
No, we're not spying.

07:02.170 --> 07:05.040
We just happen to be
standing behind this door,

07:05.040 --> 07:06.790
watching without
her knowing.

07:10.540 --> 07:13.080
Ha-ha!
That's what's up!

07:13.080 --> 07:15.330
You know,
we make a good team!

07:15.330 --> 07:16.790
You think it's that guy?

07:16.790 --> 07:18.500
If you drive the lane
with your left hand,

07:18.500 --> 07:19.580
it'll make it harder to block.

07:19.580 --> 07:20.830
Thanks, Jordan.

07:23.580 --> 07:25.170
There you go.

07:25.170 --> 07:29.500
He just told her how
to do something, and she
didn't punch him in the face.

07:29.500 --> 07:32.710
Oh, it's definitely
that guy.

07:32.710 --> 07:34.710
They're actually
pretty cute together.

07:34.710 --> 07:36.330
You know what?
I'll say it.

07:36.330 --> 07:38.040
I think I'm Team Jordan.

07:39.290 --> 07:41.540
All right.
I gotta get home.
I'll see you around.

07:41.540 --> 07:43.120
Jordan, wait.

07:43.120 --> 07:44.920
Do you wanna play
one-on-one tomorrow?

07:44.920 --> 07:48.120
Tomorrow, like Saturday?

07:48.120 --> 07:51.790
I'm volunteering
at the Golden Meadows
Senior Center in the afternoon.

07:51.790 --> 07:52.920
But you wanna play after?

07:52.920 --> 07:54.170
Like, 3:00?

07:54.170 --> 07:56.290
Yes, yes, great!
It's a date!

07:56.290 --> 08:01.000
-You mean game, right?
-Uh, yeah, that's what I meant.
It's a game. Of course.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.120
Yeah, right, game.

08:03.540 --> 08:06.670
He volunteers
at an old folks' home.

08:08.710 --> 08:12.000
Guess I just joined
Team Jordan.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.210
Come on.
Let's get out of here
before she sees us.

08:19.750 --> 08:24.880
Tess, I think you're cool,
but I don't really like you
that way.

08:26.670 --> 08:27.670
Oh.

08:30.290 --> 08:31.830
Booker?

08:31.830 --> 08:33.620
I just had another vision.

08:33.620 --> 08:35.960
Jordan's gonna break
Tess' heart.

08:35.960 --> 08:38.000
Jordan?

08:38.000 --> 08:39.830
Like, our Jordan?

08:44.500 --> 08:47.000
-(both laughing)
-Booker: Poor Tess.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.170
What are we gonna do?

09:00.210 --> 09:02.880
Tess:
Ma, get back in the tub,
I'll get it!

09:05.460 --> 09:06.960
Hey, Booker, what's up?

09:06.960 --> 09:10.250
Listen, I know you don't
wanna hear it, but I had
another vision!

09:10.250 --> 09:13.040
It was about you and... Jordan.

09:13.040 --> 09:15.620
-There is no me and Jordan.
-But I saw Jordan
about to break--

09:15.620 --> 09:18.960
I don't care what you saw.
I told you to keep your visions
out of my life.

09:18.960 --> 09:20.210
I'm just trying to help you.

09:20.210 --> 09:22.920
If I want your help,
I'll ask for it.

09:27.460 --> 09:29.040
So that's a no, then.

09:35.080 --> 09:36.540
(sighs)

09:39.790 --> 09:41.210
(sighs)

09:44.460 --> 09:45.880
(sighs)

09:45.880 --> 09:47.080
What do you want?
What do you want?

09:47.080 --> 09:49.080
What do you want?
What do you want?

09:49.080 --> 09:51.880
What if you knew
somethin' bad was gonna
happen to your friend?

09:51.880 --> 09:53.540
How do you know
somethin' bad is gonna happen?

09:53.540 --> 09:56.750
-I saw it.
-You-- you saw it, but you said
it hasn't happened yet.

09:56.750 --> 09:58.790
It-- it hasn't.

09:58.790 --> 10:01.960
You know how sometimes
you know something's gonna
happen before it happens?

10:01.960 --> 10:05.080
No, I don't-- I don't know
what's gonna happen
before it happens.

10:05.080 --> 10:06.500
No, I'm not psychic.

10:07.670 --> 10:10.420
Psychic?
Who said anything
about psychic?

10:10.420 --> 10:11.670
You know psychics
aren't real.

10:11.670 --> 10:14.500
They're not!
They're not real!
They don't live here!

10:14.500 --> 10:18.000
Psychics? Bein' real
in this house? What?
(laughs)

10:19.000 --> 10:20.210
(both sigh)

10:21.500 --> 10:24.210
S-- so... about my problem.

10:24.210 --> 10:26.920
-Mm-hm?
-I know somebody's gonna
hurt Tess' feelings.

10:26.920 --> 10:28.710
Well, then, you need
to get involved, sweetheart.

10:28.710 --> 10:29.880
But she told me
to stay out of it.

10:29.880 --> 10:33.000
I think you definitely
need to get involved.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.500
Actually, Booker, if Tess
asked you not to get involved,

10:36.500 --> 10:39.120
then you should probably
respect her wishes. Hm?

10:39.120 --> 10:41.960
Hey, Chels.
What you doin'?

10:41.960 --> 10:44.500
Oh, I'm just giving Booker
a different perspective.

10:44.500 --> 10:47.330
-That's all.
-Thank you, but he doesn't
need a different perspective.

10:47.330 --> 10:49.170
He's good, right?
You gonna go in there,

10:49.170 --> 10:50.620
you gonna handle
your business.

10:50.620 --> 10:52.670
Okay, honey, I really think
you should stay out of it.

10:52.670 --> 10:54.670
-I really think you
should stay out of it, Chels.
-Really?

10:54.670 --> 10:56.920
-Oh, are you guys fighting?
-Both: No.

10:56.920 --> 11:00.120
-We're not fighting, no.
-No, we're not fighting,
we're just having

11:00.120 --> 11:01.540
-a difference of opinion...
-Yes.

11:01.540 --> 11:03.420
...and your Aunt Chels
is wrong.

11:03.420 --> 11:07.460
No, I'm not wrong, no.
Your mother and I, we just
agree to disagree.

11:07.460 --> 11:09.120
I never agreed to that.

11:13.580 --> 11:16.710
I hate knowing
that Tess is gonna get hurt.

11:16.710 --> 11:19.540
What's the point
of being psychic
if I can't help my friends?

11:19.540 --> 11:21.710
I know, but Tess
won't talk to you.

11:21.710 --> 11:27.210
Maybe she won't talk
to me, but she didn't say
I couldn't talk to Jordan.

11:27.210 --> 11:29.790
I feel like it was implied.

11:31.170 --> 11:34.210
We're gonna go down
to the senior center
and talk Tess up.

11:34.210 --> 11:37.040
Jordan won't break her heart
if he knows how cool she is.

11:37.040 --> 11:38.540
Senior Center, huh?

11:38.540 --> 11:40.920
I do like hearing
about the good old days.

11:42.290 --> 11:43.960
How are we gonna
get down there?

11:43.960 --> 11:46.960
Allow me to call
my car service.

11:46.960 --> 11:49.000
Mama, we need a ride!

11:54.250 --> 11:58.080
Okay, remember the plan:
Find Jordan and tell him
how great Tess is

11:58.080 --> 12:00.670
-before he meets her
at 3:00.
-Got it.

12:00.670 --> 12:05.080
Well, Rae, you talked the boys
into getting involved when they
were specifically told not to.

12:05.080 --> 12:07.750
-I hope you're happy.
-I am happy.
Thanks, Chels.

12:09.210 --> 12:12.380
Hi, I'm Lawrence.
Lawrence, not Larry.

12:12.380 --> 12:14.500
We have a Larry,
but we don't like him.

12:14.500 --> 12:17.040
He knows what he did.

12:17.040 --> 12:19.500
Are you family
or volunteers?

12:19.500 --> 12:22.460
Oh, no, we're just tryin'
to find Jordan.

12:22.460 --> 12:24.170
-We need to talk to him.
-Yeah, and we're their ride.

12:24.170 --> 12:29.080
Well, you can't just hang out
in an old folks' home.
It's creepy.

12:29.080 --> 12:31.250
If you're here,
you're volunteering.

12:31.250 --> 12:34.620
Okay, new plan:
We're gonna bring joy
to old people,

12:34.620 --> 12:36.250
and then we'll talk
to Jordan.

12:36.250 --> 12:38.080
Looks like we're volunteers.

12:38.080 --> 12:41.330
Larry, do your job
and take this young man
to Mrs. Carlson

12:41.330 --> 12:43.420
and him to Mrs. Kotecki.

12:43.420 --> 12:47.000
Don't side-eye me.
You know what you did.

12:49.040 --> 12:50.290
Look at our children,
look at 'em.

12:50.290 --> 12:52.380
Ahh! Gettin' involved.

12:52.380 --> 12:54.250
Helpin' out the old people
and friends.

12:54.250 --> 12:57.290
-Do you wanna volunteer?
-Nah, I'm good.

12:57.290 --> 13:00.620
That's not like you, Rae.
You love to get involved,

13:00.620 --> 13:03.080
even when people
don't want you to.

13:04.290 --> 13:06.580
Come on, I've got
the perfect senior for you.

13:06.580 --> 13:09.210
He loves to dance,
but do not let him
outta your sight.

13:09.210 --> 13:11.210
His name is Commando Joe.

13:11.210 --> 13:12.210
Ooh.

13:15.960 --> 13:18.500
-So, you're Commando Joe.
-Yeah.

13:18.500 --> 13:21.880
-We're you in the military or--
-I was not!

13:23.540 --> 13:25.580
-This guy doesn't seem like
such a handful.
-(both laugh)

13:25.580 --> 13:27.500
All right, Joe, we heard
you like to dance,

13:27.500 --> 13:30.380
so I'm gonna
teach you how to pop, lock,
and drop it, you ready?

13:30.380 --> 13:35.920
-Okay.
-Okay, s-- so, one, two,
three and a half...

13:35.920 --> 13:39.380
-Oh...
-Very good.
Right there.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.120
Pop and drop,
now pop it!

13:42.120 --> 13:44.830
Okay, let's stop,
let's stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop.

13:44.830 --> 13:48.040
Rae, we're here for Joe.
We should let him decide.

13:48.040 --> 13:49.830
Joe, what do you want to do?

13:49.830 --> 13:53.580
I wanna bust outta here.
I wanna get a tattoo my mother
wouldn't approve of.

13:55.330 --> 13:58.460
-Okay.
-That's why you don't
give people choices.

14:05.290 --> 14:07.380
(whimpers)

14:07.380 --> 14:09.620
You take it easy,
Mrs. Kotecki.

14:11.790 --> 14:15.000
(nervously laughing)

14:19.250 --> 14:23.830
(chuckles)
You know I let you win, right?

14:23.830 --> 14:24.830
Ha!

14:28.170 --> 14:29.830
Hey, Jordan, what's up?

14:29.830 --> 14:31.880
Uh, hey, do--
do I know you?

14:31.880 --> 14:33.380
Booker, nice to meet you.

14:33.380 --> 14:35.540
So listen, I need to talk to you
about a friend of mine.

14:35.540 --> 14:38.420
Done already?
Let's get you over
to Mr. Gomez.

14:38.420 --> 14:40.290
I just need to talk
to Jordan real quick.

14:40.290 --> 14:44.210
Unless Jordan is a 96-year-old
Cuban man who cheats
at checkers,

14:44.210 --> 14:45.880
you're not talkin' to him!

14:45.880 --> 14:47.250
Um-mm.

14:56.380 --> 14:59.040
-Jordan?
-Um-mm.

15:06.380 --> 15:07.790
(coughing)

15:10.000 --> 15:12.080
I should not
have done that.

15:19.880 --> 15:21.540
Have you talked to Jordan
about Tess?

15:21.540 --> 15:23.290
I couldn't even get close
to him.

15:23.290 --> 15:26.420
I know.
Every time I tried,
Lawrence stopped me.

15:26.420 --> 15:29.540
All right!
Everybody say goodbye
to your volunteers,

15:29.540 --> 15:31.290
activity hour is over.

15:31.290 --> 15:32.460
(groans)

15:32.460 --> 15:36.120
It's almost 3:00.
Time to get ready for bed.

15:38.380 --> 15:41.750
Oh no, Jordan's gonna
go break Tess' heart.

15:41.750 --> 15:44.000
Unless we keep him here.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.420
A new, new plan...

15:45.420 --> 15:48.290
Levi, I need you to do
your disappearing box trick.

15:48.290 --> 15:49.830
But it doesn't work.

15:49.830 --> 15:51.790
I couldn't make
the grapefruit disappear.

15:51.790 --> 15:54.330
You don't need to make
anything disappear.

15:54.330 --> 15:56.670
We're gonna get Jordan
in the trunk so he can't
meet up with Tess.

15:56.670 --> 16:01.170
Ohh, the Amazing Levi
can definitely lock a kid
in trunk.

16:02.830 --> 16:05.830
Ladies and gentlemen,
you're in for a special treat,

16:05.830 --> 16:08.330
'cause we're extending
activity hour.

16:08.330 --> 16:10.460
Extended activity hour?

16:10.460 --> 16:12.290
Larry, did you do this?

16:12.290 --> 16:15.080
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, today
is your last day.

16:16.500 --> 16:21.420
Prepare yourselves
for the Amazing Levi
and his disappearing box trick!

16:21.420 --> 16:22.380
(applause)

16:22.380 --> 16:27.920
Thank you!
I will need a volunteer
from the audience.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.920
Why, Jordan,
why don't you come on up?

16:29.920 --> 16:32.420
(laughs)
I'm actually gettin' outta here
to meet somebody, so--

16:32.420 --> 16:34.750
Oh, don't worry,
it'll be real quick.

16:36.420 --> 16:41.040
As you can see,
an ordinary empty trunk.

16:41.040 --> 16:42.420
Please climb in.

16:42.420 --> 16:44.670
How long is this gonna take?
'Cause I really gotta--

16:44.670 --> 16:47.620
Can you just get in the box?

16:51.500 --> 16:54.330
Okay.
Now we just gotta keep him
in there for a while.

16:54.330 --> 16:57.040
Tess will think he flaked,
and she won't get hurt.

16:57.040 --> 17:01.080
But how are we gonna stall
a roomful of old people
that long?

17:01.080 --> 17:05.170
Uhhh... easy, I got this.

17:05.170 --> 17:08.380
Who wants to show us pictures
of their grandkids?

17:14.330 --> 17:17.330
(tango music playing)

17:17.330 --> 17:20.880
Amazing, Joe!
You're a real natural
at the tango.

17:20.880 --> 17:23.710
That's not even
how you do the tango.

17:23.710 --> 17:27.330
Chels, you have to take the lead
so he knows how to dance right.

17:27.330 --> 17:29.460
Rae, is there really
a wrong way to dance?

17:29.460 --> 17:32.170
Yes!
And you're doing it!

17:32.170 --> 17:35.420
Joe, listen to me, okay?
You go slow, slow,
quick, quick, slow.

17:35.420 --> 17:38.670
No, no, no, slow, slow--
Joe, you're slow.
You're slow, Joe!

17:38.670 --> 17:41.330
-Come on.
-I mean, come on--
This is unbelievable!

17:41.330 --> 17:42.880
-Oh, really, Chels?
-Yeah!

17:42.880 --> 17:44.380
Do you have something
to say about the way
I'm teaching Joe?

17:44.380 --> 17:46.750
It wouldn't really matter
because you would just
step right in

17:46.750 --> 17:48.330
and teach Joe for me.

17:48.330 --> 17:51.540
I feel like
you ladies aren't talking
about dancing anymore.

17:51.540 --> 17:54.830
-Ooh--
-Oh! What?

17:54.830 --> 17:57.080
Chels, if you have something
to say, just say it.

17:57.080 --> 18:01.120
Well! All I'm saying is,
maybe Joe wants the freedom
to make his own choices.

18:01.120 --> 18:03.830
All I'm saying is
Joe's a little young
to be doing what he wants,

18:03.830 --> 18:06.290
right?
You have to show him
who's boss,

18:06.290 --> 18:09.210
so that he doesn't
become a smart-mouth Joe!

18:09.210 --> 18:11.500
I do like a strong woman!

18:13.040 --> 18:15.710
You don't have to worry
about your smart-mouth Joes,

18:15.710 --> 18:18.210
because your Joes
are afraid of you.

18:18.210 --> 18:21.380
(gasps)
My Joes respect me!

18:23.250 --> 18:25.880
What are you two
talking about?

18:25.880 --> 18:28.620
Just admit it, Rae.
You think I'm a bad mom.

18:28.620 --> 18:32.580
(gasp)
Chels!
I think you're a great mom.

18:32.580 --> 18:35.290
Well, I think you're
a great mom, too!

18:36.620 --> 18:40.000
Listen, we parent differently
because we have different kids.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.710
Yeah, we do, Rae,
you're right.

18:42.710 --> 18:44.580
Maybe I could be
more stern with Levi.

18:47.920 --> 18:50.250
And I need to learn
to let go.

18:50.250 --> 18:51.330
And I will!

18:51.330 --> 18:52.710
When they turn 21.

19:00.290 --> 19:02.580
Our Joes are pretty lucky
to have us, Rae.

19:02.580 --> 19:03.580
Yeah.

19:04.670 --> 19:06.580
Where is Joe, anyway?

19:06.580 --> 19:08.960
-(gasp)
Joe's gone!
-What?

19:10.120 --> 19:11.670
My bad, my bad!

19:11.670 --> 19:14.710
Oh, no.
I think this is Joe's shirt.

19:14.710 --> 19:16.500
And it doesn't look like
he's in it.

19:19.830 --> 19:22.540
And then you hit send...

19:22.540 --> 19:25.290
and that's how you text
an emoji!

19:25.290 --> 19:27.500
(applause)

19:27.500 --> 19:30.040
It's 3:15.
You think we can
let Jordan out?

19:30.040 --> 19:33.250
Yeah.
There's no way Tess
is still at the gym.

19:35.040 --> 19:37.620
Excuse me.
Hi, have you--
have you seen Joe?

19:37.620 --> 19:38.960
You were supposed to be
watching him.

19:38.960 --> 19:42.500
I know, but we can't find him,
but we did find his sweater
and his shirt!

19:42.500 --> 19:44.330
-Yeah, and his pants!
-Yeah!

19:44.330 --> 19:46.250
Oh no, not again.

19:46.250 --> 19:48.540
Open the box!

19:51.330 --> 19:52.960
Ta-da!

19:55.670 --> 19:57.670
(chuckles)

19:59.420 --> 20:01.250
I think I'm done
with magic.

20:02.750 --> 20:05.790
We have a runner.
Of course it's Joe!

20:07.500 --> 20:09.750
That old guy must've let
Jordan out.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.830
We gotta get down to the gym!

20:11.830 --> 20:15.460
-Mama! We need a ride!
-Okay! Okay!

20:21.040 --> 20:24.210
(laugh) Oh...

20:24.210 --> 20:26.920
I'm really glad I came
before you left.

20:26.920 --> 20:28.380
I really like hangin' out
with you.

20:28.380 --> 20:30.380
I like hanging out
with you, too.

20:31.420 --> 20:32.750
Jordan?

20:32.750 --> 20:34.420
There's something I need
to tell you.

20:36.120 --> 20:38.120
I like you.

20:38.120 --> 20:39.540
I like you a lot.

20:40.670 --> 20:44.080
Ohh. Um...

20:44.080 --> 20:48.920
Tess, I think you're cool,
but I don't really like you
that way.

20:50.920 --> 20:52.620
Oh.

20:52.620 --> 20:54.670
Yeah, that was--
that was stupid.

20:54.670 --> 20:57.120
Just forget I--
Just forget I ever
said anything.

20:59.170 --> 21:02.040
I'm sorry.
Are-- are we cool?

21:02.040 --> 21:04.540
Yeah.
Yeah, we're cool.

21:04.540 --> 21:05.960
I'll see you around.

21:16.170 --> 21:20.000
What's the point of being able
to see the future if you can't
change it?

21:20.000 --> 21:22.540
Maybe you weren't supposed
to change it.

21:27.540 --> 21:29.790
What are you doing?

21:29.790 --> 21:34.750
Tess doesn't need
a psychic right now.
She needs a friend.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.040
Hey.

21:42.790 --> 21:44.500
What are you doing here?

21:44.500 --> 21:47.420
I thought I told you
to stay outta my business.

21:47.420 --> 21:50.880
Uh-- I'm not here for you.

21:50.880 --> 21:52.540
I'm just here to play
a little ball.

21:54.330 --> 21:57.120
Hoo! One-nothing.

21:57.120 --> 21:59.460
You're losin' to me.
That must hurt.

22:01.750 --> 22:04.620
Please.
I've never lost to you
in my life.

22:10.380 --> 22:12.290
Two-nothing.

22:12.290 --> 22:14.250
You're gonna have to work
harder than that.

22:19.540 --> 22:21.710

22:38.750 --> 22:42.790
Tess, your mom is terrible
at parallel parking.

22:42.790 --> 22:45.790
Yeah, how'd she pass
the driver's test?

22:45.790 --> 22:47.670
Who says she did?

22:52.210 --> 22:53.580
Hey, Booker.

22:57.750 --> 22:58.620
Anytime.
