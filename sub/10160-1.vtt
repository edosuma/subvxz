00:02.377 --> 00:04.630
[Elizabeth] Isn't life
the most peculiar thing?

00:04.630 --> 00:06.590
The twists and turns...

00:06.590 --> 00:08.801
the triumphs and failures...

00:08.801 --> 00:11.178
they all lead us
on the most unexpected journey.

00:11.178 --> 00:14.055
I came to Hope Valley
to become a teacher,

00:14.055 --> 00:17.225
but what I found
was so much more.

00:17.225 --> 00:21.188
This town and the people here
have changed me.

00:21.188 --> 00:22.481
They've opened my eyes

00:22.481 --> 00:24.900
to things I couldn't
have imagined before.

00:24.900 --> 00:26.443
I found true love here...

00:28.069 --> 00:30.071
I've made
wonderful friends here,

00:30.071 --> 00:32.407
some of whom
have found love themselves.

00:32.407 --> 00:33.993
And while our little town

00:33.993 --> 00:35.744
can neither spare us
from misfortune,

00:35.744 --> 00:38.664
nor shelter us
from the past

00:38.664 --> 00:41.082
and the complications
it brings,

00:41.082 --> 00:43.084
Hope Valley is my home now--

00:43.084 --> 00:45.963
my present and my future.

00:47.088 --> 00:50.009
I've been looking
everywhere for you!

00:50.926 --> 00:53.094
The church
is low on firewood.

00:53.094 --> 00:55.806
I thought we were going
for a ride after school.

00:55.806 --> 00:58.433
Well, we were...
but you had company.

00:59.727 --> 01:01.269
-How did--
-I came to pick you up

01:01.269 --> 01:04.023
but Charles was there,
on bended knee.

01:05.399 --> 01:06.650
How much did you hear?

01:06.650 --> 01:07.818
Well, enough

01:07.818 --> 01:09.486
to know
that I shouldn't be listening,

01:09.486 --> 01:11.030
so I left.

01:11.030 --> 01:12.072
I told him no, Jack.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.114
But he wouldn't
have been there

01:13.114 --> 01:15.116
if he didn't think
he had a chance.

01:15.116 --> 01:17.995
I never gave him any reason
to believe that.

01:19.120 --> 01:21.122
Why is it that every time
I think the past is the past,

01:21.122 --> 01:22.123
something like this happens?

01:22.123 --> 01:23.959
I don't know.

01:23.959 --> 01:25.920
Because life is messy?

01:25.920 --> 01:28.547
Because people are messy?

01:28.547 --> 01:30.382
Maybe some things
just aren't meant to be.

01:32.676 --> 01:34.678
You don't mean that.

01:34.678 --> 01:37.138
I don't know
what I mean right now.

01:37.138 --> 01:38.223
Jack!

01:38.223 --> 01:39.433
We can't go back,

01:39.433 --> 01:42.101
not when we've come this far.

01:43.604 --> 01:46.147
It's over with Charles,

01:46.147 --> 01:47.816
once and for all.

01:47.816 --> 01:50.277
I don't know
if I believe that.

01:50.277 --> 01:52.487
Then let me convince you.

01:53.572 --> 01:56.157
[♪♪♪]

02:14.969 --> 02:17.512
[♪♪♪]

02:24.895 --> 02:27.397
[♪♪♪]

02:43.789 --> 02:46.207
[Elizabeth] They say
time heals all wounds,

02:46.207 --> 02:49.003
but will that be enough?

02:49.003 --> 02:52.213
I wish we could go back
and do everything differently,

02:52.213 --> 02:53.590
but here we are.

02:53.590 --> 02:58.386
As we say goodbye to Christmas,
a new year is upon us.

02:58.386 --> 03:01.974
I can only hope the past
stays in the past,

03:01.974 --> 03:05.310
and the future
is something we cherish...

03:05.310 --> 03:06.561
together.

03:07.270 --> 03:10.065
[♪♪♪]

03:16.947 --> 03:20.117
Well, have you and Mr. Coulter
made any big plans

03:20.117 --> 03:21.076
for New Year's Eve yet?

03:21.076 --> 03:22.285
No.

03:22.285 --> 03:24.788
It's going to be a quiet
little evening, I'm afraid.

03:24.788 --> 03:26.247
I'll take this one.

03:26.247 --> 03:28.416
Very good.
That's 10 cents.

03:28.416 --> 03:30.585
Oh! I almost forgot.

03:31.503 --> 03:33.755
This came for you this morning.

03:33.755 --> 03:36.257
[gasping] Oh!

03:36.257 --> 03:37.926
I've been
waiting for this.

03:39.594 --> 03:42.848
[gasps and giggles]
I can't believe it!

03:42.848 --> 03:44.265
Is everything all right?

03:44.265 --> 03:45.433
All right?
It's incredible!

03:45.433 --> 03:47.019
This is going to be
the best New Year's Eve

03:47.019 --> 03:48.478
in the history
of Hope Valley!

03:48.478 --> 03:50.480
Oh, Mr. Yost! Mm!
Thank you.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.607
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

03:55.069 --> 03:56.820
What was that about?

03:56.820 --> 03:58.279
Beats me,

03:58.279 --> 03:59.907
but I am
not complaining.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.449
[chuckles]

04:02.325 --> 04:04.285
Charles proposed?

04:04.285 --> 04:05.579
I was totally shocked.

04:05.579 --> 04:06.621
He didn't
look too happy

04:06.621 --> 04:08.415
when he got on
that stage coach.

04:08.415 --> 04:09.583
That's because
he isn't used to

04:09.583 --> 04:11.168
hearing the word
"no" very often.

04:11.168 --> 04:14.129
He'll make some lucky woman
very happy one of these days.

04:14.129 --> 04:15.296
Just won't be me.

04:15.296 --> 04:16.590
Does Jack know
what happened?

04:16.590 --> 04:19.676
[sighing]
Jack overheard most of it.

04:19.676 --> 04:20.761
No!

04:20.761 --> 04:22.054
Yes.

04:22.054 --> 04:24.848
Okay, you and I need to
sit down and catch up.

04:24.848 --> 04:26.100
Was Jack upset?

04:26.641 --> 04:28.309
He thinks
I gave Charles hope.

04:28.309 --> 04:31.063
Well, I suppose
that's a natural reaction.

04:31.063 --> 04:32.397
After all, he did propose.

04:32.397 --> 04:34.315
Charles is a dear friend.

04:34.315 --> 04:35.692
I knew his feelings
were stronger,

04:35.692 --> 04:37.986
but I was always
honest with him.

04:37.986 --> 04:38.987
Well, it's not your fault

04:38.987 --> 04:41.156
that Charles
misread your friendship

04:41.156 --> 04:42.157
as something more.

04:42.157 --> 04:43.491
I know.

04:43.491 --> 04:46.161
Jack just needs
a little bit of time.

04:46.161 --> 04:47.328
I don't blame him.

04:47.328 --> 04:49.330
And you're smart
to give it to him.

04:49.330 --> 04:51.332
Thank you.

04:55.963 --> 04:56.964
You've changed

04:56.964 --> 04:58.548
since you've come
back from Hamilton.

04:58.548 --> 04:59.424
How?

04:59.424 --> 05:01.093
You know who you are now.

05:02.177 --> 05:03.887
And who I'm not.

05:03.887 --> 05:06.098
And now that
I have it figured out...

05:06.098 --> 05:07.182
Look out, Hope Valley.

05:07.182 --> 05:08.934
Look out, world.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.272
Well, that's strange.

05:13.272 --> 05:15.356
I baked a pie,
and now it's gone.

05:15.356 --> 05:18.068
You probably
served it at lunch.

05:18.068 --> 05:19.987
I guess I must have.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.488
[chuckles]

05:21.488 --> 05:23.406
Anyway, who needs pie when
there's so much to talk about?

05:25.826 --> 05:28.036
There is nothing
more to talk about.

05:28.036 --> 05:29.370
Well, honestly...

05:29.370 --> 05:31.372
if it were me,
I would've decked the guy.

05:31.372 --> 05:33.374
It wouldn't have
solved the problem.

05:33.374 --> 05:34.918
Charles is like
a bad penny.

05:34.918 --> 05:36.461
He keeps showing up
where he's not wanted.

05:36.461 --> 05:37.462
He's still got
some business

05:37.462 --> 05:38.630
with the sawmill,

05:38.630 --> 05:40.381
but if he ever
proposes to me,

05:40.381 --> 05:42.301
then I really
will deck him.

05:42.301 --> 05:44.594
I'm not convinced he's ever
gonna stay away from Elizabeth.

05:44.594 --> 05:46.596
Aw, Jack.
It doesn't matter.

05:46.596 --> 05:49.141
Elizabeth only has eyes for you.
Everyone knows that.

05:49.141 --> 05:50.267
I hope you're right.

05:50.267 --> 05:51.226
Trust me
on this one.

05:51.226 --> 05:52.811
Have a good day.

06:08.409 --> 06:10.829
[♪♪♪]

06:13.665 --> 06:16.126
You've already decided
I'm guilty, haven't you?

06:16.126 --> 06:17.376
I know what I saw.

06:17.376 --> 06:18.419
It's not what you think.

06:18.419 --> 06:19.838
What else can
I think, Bill?

06:19.838 --> 06:22.423
You had counterfeit money
and printing plates

06:22.423 --> 06:23.675
in your hotel room,

06:23.675 --> 06:25.426
and that was after
you were pulled off the case.

06:25.426 --> 06:27.137
I did it for good reason.

06:27.137 --> 06:28.096
I wired Inspector Houston.

06:28.096 --> 06:29.514
He's gonna be here
on the next stage,

06:29.514 --> 06:31.725
to take you back for trial.

06:33.434 --> 06:35.937
You're making
a mistake, Jack!

06:35.937 --> 06:37.480
[sighs]

06:37.480 --> 06:39.482
I wish
I could believe that.

06:40.483 --> 06:42.277
Well, I think
we'll have to add another shift

06:42.277 --> 06:44.445
if we're going to make delivery
before the first of the year.

06:44.445 --> 06:47.324
Lee! I won.
[giggles] I won!

06:47.324 --> 06:49.659
Uh, give us a minute,
all right, fellas? Thank you.

06:49.659 --> 06:50.911
[Rosemary giggles]

06:52.829 --> 06:55.707
Okay. I'll bite.
What did you win?

06:55.707 --> 06:57.709
The San Francisco Herald
wants to do a story

06:57.709 --> 07:00.461
on how people celebrate
New Year's Eve on the frontier.

07:00.461 --> 07:02.463
Something that really
captures the spirit

07:02.463 --> 07:05.633
of hard-working people,
fighting obstacles,

07:05.633 --> 07:07.094
standing up
for their families,

07:07.094 --> 07:09.470
creating new bonds
and forging into--

07:09.470 --> 07:10.471
Rosemary?

07:11.514 --> 07:13.433
So they ran a contest.

07:13.433 --> 07:14.475
Ah.

07:14.475 --> 07:15.602
-And?
-I wrote an essay

07:15.602 --> 07:18.105
about our dear little town,
and...

07:18.105 --> 07:19.231
I won.

07:19.231 --> 07:21.358
Well! Congratulations.

07:21.358 --> 07:23.818
So what does that mean?
You win a prize or something?

07:23.818 --> 07:25.195
Better.

07:25.195 --> 07:27.364
They're sending a reporter--
here, to Hope Valley--

07:27.364 --> 07:28.823
to do a story on New Year's Eve

07:28.823 --> 07:30.825
that is going to run
on the front page

07:30.825 --> 07:33.494
of the biggest newspaper
on the entire west coast.

07:33.494 --> 07:35.914
Featuring... let me guess.

07:35.914 --> 07:37.082
You?

07:37.082 --> 07:38.417
Hmm! How did you know?

07:38.417 --> 07:39.834
What can I say?
Lucky guess.

07:39.834 --> 07:41.502
Well, there is so much to do.

07:41.502 --> 07:43.463
I need to get started
right away,

07:43.463 --> 07:45.299
and I can
count on you to pitch in?

07:45.299 --> 07:46.507
Pitch in with what?

07:46.507 --> 07:48.385
I made a list.

07:48.385 --> 07:50.929
Of course you did.

07:50.929 --> 07:53.514
This is not
a list, Rosemary.

07:53.514 --> 07:55.058
This is the Magna Carta.

07:55.058 --> 07:56.517
Oh, Lee. Come on!

07:56.517 --> 07:57.602
It'll be fun.

07:57.602 --> 07:59.646
A project for us
to do together.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.440
We've always
made a great team.

08:01.440 --> 08:03.191
Yay, us!

08:03.191 --> 08:04.401
[laughs]
Take a look.

08:04.401 --> 08:06.069
We can talk
about it tomorrow.

08:06.069 --> 08:07.112
I can hardly wait.

08:07.112 --> 08:08.280
What is this?

08:08.280 --> 08:10.490
Fireworks. Champagne.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.659
A marching band?

08:12.659 --> 08:14.619
[laughing]
A marching band!

08:14.619 --> 08:17.164
Where am I
gonna get a marching band?

08:19.874 --> 08:21.168
Elizabeth.

08:25.297 --> 08:27.548
I've been thinking
about our conversation.

08:27.548 --> 08:28.967
And?

08:28.967 --> 08:31.386
And I don't understand
how Charles could've shown up

08:31.386 --> 08:32.429
if you hadn't encouraged him.

08:33.763 --> 08:36.224
Jack, I was very clear
with Charles,

08:36.224 --> 08:39.186
and I was just as surprised
to see him here as you were.

08:41.562 --> 08:43.648
Can we talk
about this tonight?

08:43.648 --> 08:45.817
Whenever you're ready.

08:47.361 --> 08:49.070
And, Elizabeth...

08:49.070 --> 08:51.990
you were
very convincing before.

08:53.074 --> 08:55.452
[♪♪♪]

08:59.580 --> 09:01.624
Inspector Houston.

09:01.624 --> 09:03.710
You must be
Constable Thornton.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.586
Yes, sir. Welcome.

09:05.586 --> 09:07.588
Let me help you
get settled.

09:07.588 --> 09:08.589
Thanks!

09:08.589 --> 09:10.591
Congratulations
on a job well done.

09:10.591 --> 09:12.344
Well, it's never
a happy day

09:12.344 --> 09:14.595
when we have to arrest
one of our own, sir.

09:14.595 --> 09:15.596
Well, I had
my suspicions

09:15.596 --> 09:17.140
about Bill Avery
for a long time now,

09:17.140 --> 09:18.975
but you were the one
who caught him red-handed.

09:18.975 --> 09:20.227
They set
a trial date yet?

09:20.227 --> 09:22.479
Not yet, but they'll
expect you to testify.

09:23.604 --> 09:25.148
-Good day.
-Good day.

09:25.148 --> 09:27.567
A reporter from
the San Francisco Herald

09:27.567 --> 09:28.568
is coming here,

09:28.568 --> 09:29.610
to Hope Valley?

09:29.610 --> 09:30.695
Yes, indeed.

09:30.695 --> 09:31.821
To enlighten the world

09:31.821 --> 09:34.615
on how we celebrate
New Year's Eve.

09:34.615 --> 09:36.493
But we don't
really do anything

09:36.493 --> 09:37.744
for New Year's here.

09:37.744 --> 09:39.162
It's a pretty
boring holiday.

09:39.162 --> 09:40.539
I'm asleep by 10:00.

09:40.539 --> 09:43.833
Well, this year we are
going to celebrate in style.

09:43.833 --> 09:45.126
How?

09:45.126 --> 09:46.086
[deep breath]

09:46.086 --> 09:49.339
A grand ceremony
in front of the church,

09:49.339 --> 09:50.590
with fireworks

09:50.590 --> 09:52.592
and a dedication
for the memory box.

09:52.592 --> 09:53.634
Oh, a memory box?

09:53.634 --> 09:55.636
You mean like
a time capsule?

09:55.636 --> 09:57.514
It's a wonderful way

09:57.514 --> 09:59.224
to commemorate
the year gone by.

09:59.224 --> 10:01.017
The memory box committee

10:01.017 --> 10:03.437
collects important items
from everyone in the town,

10:03.437 --> 10:04.645
seals them up,

10:04.645 --> 10:07.774
to be opened
100 years from now.

10:07.774 --> 10:10.110
I would love to be
in charge of that committee!

10:10.110 --> 10:10.944
Done!

10:10.944 --> 10:12.404
We'll also have an art contest,

10:12.404 --> 10:15.823
and the piece that best embodies
the spirit of the New Year's

10:15.823 --> 10:17.992
will be placed
in the memory box,

10:17.992 --> 10:19.286
along with
the other memorabilia.

10:19.286 --> 10:20.912
What about...

10:20.912 --> 10:23.498
planting a tree
as part of the ceremony?

10:23.498 --> 10:24.665
Yes! Dottie,

10:24.665 --> 10:26.418
that is an excellent idea!

10:26.418 --> 10:28.669
And of course, we must have
a program for the children.

10:28.669 --> 10:30.755
Yes, a program--
something simple.

10:30.755 --> 10:32.673
A recitation, perhaps.

10:32.673 --> 10:33.674
I'll be sure

10:33.674 --> 10:34.801
to let Miss Thatcher know

10:34.801 --> 10:36.803
so she can get started
right away.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.513
Miss Thatcher?

10:38.513 --> 10:39.556
Well, won't she be

10:39.556 --> 10:40.681
directing the children?

10:40.681 --> 10:42.350
You'll be
far too busy,

10:42.350 --> 10:44.060
with all of
your other responsibilities.

10:44.060 --> 10:46.020
Oh... dear.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.608
Do you think
she can handle it?

10:49.608 --> 10:51.692
The sign
of a true leader

10:51.692 --> 10:54.529
is the ability to delegate.

10:54.529 --> 10:57.198
Of course it is.

10:57.198 --> 10:59.159
Yes, indeed.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.535
I'll make sure
to tell her.

11:00.535 --> 11:01.702
[Rosemary]
You do that.

11:01.702 --> 11:03.413
Well, this is
just so much fun!

11:03.413 --> 11:05.373
Delegating.

11:13.756 --> 11:14.799
So have you made

11:14.799 --> 11:17.135
any New Year's
resolutions yet?

11:17.135 --> 11:18.136
Have you?

11:18.136 --> 11:19.678
Mm-hmm.

11:19.678 --> 11:22.599
To be patient,
to be kind.

11:22.599 --> 11:24.809
Not to envy,
but to trust.

11:24.809 --> 11:25.810
First Corinthians.

11:25.810 --> 11:27.228
My favorite passage.

11:27.228 --> 11:29.772
It's not that
I don't trust you.

11:29.772 --> 11:32.733
Well, then
what is it?

11:32.733 --> 11:34.944
Charles is
everything I'm not.

11:34.944 --> 11:36.821
High society,
social status...

11:36.821 --> 11:38.739
I mean, you and he
have a lot in common.

11:38.739 --> 11:40.867
Only on
the surface.

11:42.785 --> 11:44.621
Jack, you said

11:44.621 --> 11:45.955
things could
be hard for us,

11:45.955 --> 11:47.957
because we come from
different worlds,

11:47.957 --> 11:49.750
but you also said
we could face anything,

11:49.750 --> 11:51.294
if we do it together.

11:52.546 --> 11:54.047
I did.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.757
Do you still
feel that way?

11:57.758 --> 11:58.552
Do you?

12:00.845 --> 12:03.014
With all of my heart.

12:03.014 --> 12:04.891
It will be
a new year.

12:04.891 --> 12:07.602
This could be
a new start for us.

12:07.602 --> 12:09.354
Not to rush...

12:09.354 --> 12:11.648
to get things right.

12:12.815 --> 12:14.775
Yeah, that's probably
a good idea--

12:14.775 --> 12:15.776
not to rush.

12:15.776 --> 12:16.861
I think so.

12:16.861 --> 12:19.822
To proceed cautiously.

12:21.408 --> 12:23.243
Not too cautiously.

12:25.453 --> 12:27.080
To take our time.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.708
And enjoy
the time we take.

12:29.708 --> 12:32.544
Well, I'm all
for enjoying things.

12:42.679 --> 12:44.805
You sweeping the sun
off the sidewalk?

12:44.805 --> 12:45.806
Just getting the cafe ready

12:45.806 --> 12:47.808
for the big
New Year's Eve festivities.

12:47.808 --> 12:48.851
Those boys from the mill

12:48.851 --> 12:51.812
have a talent
for tracking mud onto my floors.

12:51.812 --> 12:52.855
Ah, they're just in a hurry

12:52.855 --> 12:54.399
to dig into
your sweet potato casserole.

12:54.399 --> 12:56.735
Well, it'll still be there, even
if they wipe their feet.

12:56.735 --> 12:59.070
Think I could convince them
to take their shoes off?

12:59.070 --> 13:00.238
[laughs]

13:00.238 --> 13:03.575
I don't think their socks
would be much cleaner.

13:03.575 --> 13:04.825
[chuckles]

13:04.825 --> 13:07.078
I had a really nice time
at dinner the other night.

13:07.078 --> 13:08.455
I'm sorry
if I asked

13:08.455 --> 13:10.290
too many
personal questions.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.459
I think it was my answers
that were the problem.

13:12.459 --> 13:13.834
I was
wondering, um,

13:13.834 --> 13:16.337
if you'd like to have dinner
with me Friday.

13:16.337 --> 13:17.880
There's more to the story.

13:17.880 --> 13:21.134
I'm taking dinner
to the Hendersons on Friday.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.843
Jason's mother is sick.

13:22.843 --> 13:24.929
Sorry to hear that.

13:24.929 --> 13:27.432
Well, perhaps
another time, then?

13:27.432 --> 13:28.891
Abigail!

13:28.891 --> 13:31.852
It is so nice to see you
sweeping and tidying up.

13:31.852 --> 13:32.895
I wish some of
the other merchants

13:32.895 --> 13:35.523
would have the same sense
of civic pride that you do.

13:35.523 --> 13:36.941
We want to look
our absolute best

13:36.941 --> 13:38.859
for the reporter
from the Herald.

13:38.859 --> 13:39.902
[laughs]

13:39.902 --> 13:44.073
Well, I'll leave you
two ladies to your work.

13:44.073 --> 13:45.866
Now, I trust
the church is going to be

13:45.866 --> 13:47.826
in tip-top shape
for New Year's?

13:47.826 --> 13:49.537
I'll let God know
there's gonna be an inspection.

13:49.537 --> 13:50.829
[Abigail] Frank?

13:53.416 --> 13:55.376
Let's grab that dinner soon.

13:56.628 --> 13:58.755
Great.

14:00.881 --> 14:01.966
Dinner?

14:01.966 --> 14:04.427
Don't you have
somewhere to be?

14:04.427 --> 14:05.886
As a matter of fact,

14:05.886 --> 14:07.764
there is a decorations
committee meeting

14:07.764 --> 14:08.889
for the New Year's Eve party,

14:08.889 --> 14:11.017
and then one for
the tree dedication ceremony,

14:11.017 --> 14:12.893
and then there's
the refreshment committee.

14:12.893 --> 14:15.188
So many committees,
so little time.

14:15.188 --> 14:17.148
There's only so much of me
to go around.

14:17.148 --> 14:18.857
Such a shame.

14:18.857 --> 14:20.318
It is, isn't it?

14:20.318 --> 14:22.403
[giggling]

14:23.655 --> 14:24.905
Clara,

14:24.905 --> 14:27.283
did Ned deliver those extra
bottles of milk I ordered?

14:27.283 --> 14:29.327
They were on the back porch
when I left this morning.

14:29.327 --> 14:30.870
I didn't see them.

14:38.419 --> 14:41.381
[♪♪♪]

14:43.424 --> 14:45.885
That's odd.

14:48.054 --> 14:52.809
[♪♪♪]

15:05.488 --> 15:08.199
[Elizabeth] As you all know,
we have a big holiday coming up.

15:08.199 --> 15:09.116
Even though New Year's

15:09.116 --> 15:10.951
is celebrated
all over the world,

15:10.951 --> 15:12.620
what some of you may not know

15:12.620 --> 15:13.913
is that the new year

15:13.913 --> 15:15.456
doesn't start at the same time
for everyone.

15:15.456 --> 15:17.709
If you want to be the first
to celebrate New Year's,

15:17.709 --> 15:20.461
you have to go to a place
in the Pacific Ocean

15:20.461 --> 15:23.464
called Christmas Island.

15:23.464 --> 15:25.383
And if you want to be the last,

15:25.383 --> 15:30.263
you have to go
all the way...

15:30.263 --> 15:31.972
to the Cook Islands.

15:31.972 --> 15:34.684
Now, in New York City,

15:34.684 --> 15:35.976
in 1907,

15:35.976 --> 15:38.979
they built a giant ball...

15:38.979 --> 15:40.981
and when the clock
strikes 12:00,

15:40.981 --> 15:43.735
it slides down a giant flagpole,

15:43.735 --> 15:45.528
and everyone cheers.

15:45.528 --> 15:46.863
Mm-hmm?

15:46.863 --> 15:47.988
Are we going to
have a giant ball

15:47.988 --> 15:49.616
slide down
the flagpole here?

15:49.616 --> 15:50.867
No, Emily,

15:50.867 --> 15:53.119
but our class is going to put on

15:53.119 --> 15:54.995
a special
New Year's Eve program,

15:54.995 --> 15:56.873
and there's going to be
an art contest.

15:56.873 --> 15:58.792
Yes, Laura?

15:58.792 --> 16:01.085
Does everyone have to
be in the art contest?

16:01.085 --> 16:02.754
It a lot of fun.

16:02.754 --> 16:05.005
And there's gonna be a prize
for the winner.

16:05.005 --> 16:08.008
But we won't get started
on that until tomorrow.

16:08.008 --> 16:12.012
Today, we're going to learn
arithmetic!

16:12.012 --> 16:13.180
[moaning]

16:14.599 --> 16:16.976
Shall we have
some cookies first?

16:16.976 --> 16:18.978
[class agreeing happily]

16:21.355 --> 16:23.524
Miss Thatcher...

16:23.524 --> 16:25.985
there's a boy outside.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.361
I've never seen him before.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.908
[♪♪♪]

16:31.908 --> 16:33.993
I don't see anyone.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.286
He went around back.

16:39.206 --> 16:41.709
All right, everyone.
Please, stay in your seats.

16:41.709 --> 16:43.127
Thank you.

16:46.631 --> 16:47.966
[exhales]

16:50.551 --> 16:53.972
[♪♪♪]

16:55.515 --> 16:56.808
Hello.

16:56.808 --> 16:58.977
I'm Miss Thatcher.

16:58.977 --> 17:01.020
Would you like to join us
for some cookies?

17:02.104 --> 17:04.273
You can meet some of
the other children.

17:06.359 --> 17:09.028
[♪♪♪]

17:15.075 --> 17:17.036
[school cow-bell clangs]

17:19.664 --> 17:21.081
Have a good day!

17:21.081 --> 17:22.709
And don't forget
to work on your lines

17:22.709 --> 17:24.251
for the New Year's program!

17:24.251 --> 17:25.378
Miss Thatcher,

17:25.378 --> 17:27.547
I don't think I can
be in the art contest.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.007
Why not?

17:29.007 --> 17:30.132
Time to go, Laura.

17:30.132 --> 17:31.091
Coming.

17:42.896 --> 17:44.271
I thought you
might need

17:44.271 --> 17:46.106
some help carrying your books
home from school.

17:46.106 --> 17:48.651
That's the best offer
I've had all day.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.112
Oh, I wanted
to ask you--

17:52.112 --> 17:53.990
there was a young boy
who was outside

17:53.990 --> 17:55.742
the back of
the schoolhouse earlier.

17:55.742 --> 17:57.117
Light hair.
About 10.

17:57.117 --> 17:58.578
I've never
seen him before.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.120
Any idea
who he might be?

18:00.120 --> 18:01.998
He's probably just
one of the new settlers

18:01.998 --> 18:03.624
in the valley.

18:03.624 --> 18:05.084
I asked him inside,

18:05.084 --> 18:06.126
but I think I might
have scared him off.

18:06.126 --> 18:08.462
Oh, well, I was
scared of my teachers

18:08.462 --> 18:10.089
when I was a boy, too.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.966
Yes, but I'm not
a scary teacher.

18:11.966 --> 18:14.844
I don't know, I've seen
your "scary teacher" face.

18:14.844 --> 18:15.970
Jack Thornton,

18:15.970 --> 18:17.471
I do not have
a "scary teacher face."

18:19.807 --> 18:20.975
You better be careful,

18:20.975 --> 18:22.476
or your face
might freeze like that.

18:22.476 --> 18:25.980
Well, I-I know one way
to make sure it doesn't.

18:25.980 --> 18:27.356
What's that?

18:30.150 --> 18:32.236
[Rip growls and barks]

18:32.236 --> 18:34.030
Calm down, boy.

18:34.030 --> 18:35.489

18:36.449 --> 18:38.158
What, did you forget
to feed him today?

18:38.158 --> 18:40.119
No, I don't think that's it.

18:41.955 --> 18:43.414

18:43.414 --> 18:44.707

18:44.707 --> 18:46.042

What are you doing?

18:46.042 --> 18:48.753
I'm testing a theory!
I think he's jealous.

18:48.753 --> 18:50.170
Excuse me?

18:50.170 --> 18:51.297
I've seen it before.

18:51.297 --> 18:53.173
When I joined the Mounties,
Tom got a dog,

18:53.173 --> 18:54.383
and when I came back
for a visit,

18:54.383 --> 18:56.594
he wouldn't let me near him
without barking up a storm.

18:56.594 --> 18:57.845
You can't be serious.

18:57.845 --> 19:00.180
Rip and I go way back.

19:00.180 --> 19:01.724
[Elizabeth]
Well, animals love me.

19:01.724 --> 19:03.142
Remember, at the homestead?

19:03.142 --> 19:05.144
They named a cow after me.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.521
I don't know
if I'd be bragging about that.

19:08.606 --> 19:09.482
Well, Rip and I

19:09.482 --> 19:12.485
are just gonna have
to work things out.

19:12.485 --> 19:13.569
I know.

19:13.569 --> 19:15.237
Why don't I take him
with me for a few days?

19:15.237 --> 19:17.615
We'll be best friends
before you know it.

19:17.615 --> 19:19.033

19:19.033 --> 19:21.201
It might not be
as easy as you think.

19:21.201 --> 19:22.870
He can be a tough customer.

19:22.870 --> 19:25.164
Well, I can be tough, too.

19:27.541 --> 19:28.167
Okay.

19:28.375 --> 19:29.502
He's all yours.

19:31.295 --> 19:32.505
Come on, boy.

19:32.505 --> 19:35.466
How about you and me
go get a nice yummy snack?

19:36.634 --> 19:39.303
Come on, boy!

19:39.303 --> 19:42.181
Come on!

19:43.516 --> 19:45.059
[whispers] Go on.

19:45.059 --> 19:47.186
[♪♪♪]

19:57.321 --> 19:59.532
[door opens]

19:59.532 --> 20:01.492
[door shuts]

20:04.037 --> 20:07.247
Well, if it isn't
the great Inspector Avery.

20:07.247 --> 20:09.500
Should've listened
to me, Bill,

20:09.500 --> 20:11.210
but you couldn't stay
away, could you?

20:11.210 --> 20:13.253
The case wasn't closed.

20:13.253 --> 20:15.965
You disobeyed
a direct order.

20:15.965 --> 20:17.967
And if I were you,
I'd start thinking

20:17.967 --> 20:19.385
about getting the best
lawyer I could afford.

20:19.385 --> 20:21.595
Not that it's gonna
do you any good.

20:28.602 --> 20:31.522
We both know who's guilty.

20:34.316 --> 20:37.528
You're a crook,
and you're gonna pay.

20:39.405 --> 20:41.448
[♪♪♪]

20:43.409 --> 20:46.245
I'm going to enjoy
watching you rot.

20:47.872 --> 20:50.249
[♪♪♪]

21:01.677 --> 21:03.179
Excuse me.

21:03.179 --> 21:04.555
I'm looking
for a friend of mine.

21:04.555 --> 21:06.057
Matt Landry.

21:06.057 --> 21:08.059
Landry...
I'm not familiar with the name.

21:08.059 --> 21:10.310
Heard he moved to Hope Valley.

21:10.310 --> 21:12.146
Well, maybe check over yonder,
by the river.

21:12.146 --> 21:13.689
There're some squatters
down there.

21:13.689 --> 21:15.191
Thanks.

21:15.191 --> 21:16.275
I'll do that.

21:16.275 --> 21:17.484
Now, is there a hotel in town?

21:17.484 --> 21:18.819
It's above
the saloon.

21:18.819 --> 21:20.863
Much obliged.

21:24.242 --> 21:25.659
Come across this Landry,

21:25.659 --> 21:27.411
you want me
to give him a message?

21:29.329 --> 21:31.331
Rather deliver that in person.

21:31.331 --> 21:32.875
Thanks for the offer, though.

21:47.347 --> 21:48.348
If you were hungry,

21:48.348 --> 21:49.934
you should have
just asked.

21:49.934 --> 21:51.894
I'll put everything back.
Just let me go.

21:51.894 --> 21:53.479
Whoa, hold on,
young man.

21:55.982 --> 21:58.484
Why don't I get you
some fried chicken instead?

22:00.360 --> 22:02.947
I didn't hear a "Yes, please."

22:04.240 --> 22:05.365
Yes, please.

22:05.365 --> 22:07.493
Much better.

22:09.495 --> 22:12.873
You're the boy I saw outside
the schoolhouse, aren't you?

22:16.294 --> 22:18.004
What's your name?

22:21.048 --> 22:22.382
Thomas Edison?

22:22.382 --> 22:24.343
Huckleberry Finn?

22:25.385 --> 22:27.721
No, you must be
Napoleon Bonaparte.

22:27.721 --> 22:28.722
[chuckles]

22:28.722 --> 22:30.599
No. Cody.

22:30.599 --> 22:32.643
Where are you
from, Cody?

22:32.643 --> 22:33.769
[footsteps]

22:33.769 --> 22:35.896
Can I have
some potatoes, too?

22:37.439 --> 22:38.774
Please?

22:45.239 --> 22:46.406
This is good.

22:46.406 --> 22:48.159
I bet your mom
makes cobbler

22:48.159 --> 22:49.409
that's pretty good, too.

22:49.409 --> 22:51.411
When you finish,
why don't I take you home,

22:51.411 --> 22:52.412
and we'll ask her?

22:52.412 --> 22:54.414
I'd better go.

22:54.414 --> 22:55.457
[Jack] Oh, hold on
there, buddy.

22:55.457 --> 22:58.002
Cody... we need
to know where you live.

22:58.002 --> 23:00.171
Your parents
must be worried about you.

23:00.171 --> 23:01.421
I can take care of myself.

23:01.421 --> 23:02.506
[Jack]
Oh, I know you can,

23:02.506 --> 23:04.967
but it's not safe for you
to be out alone this late.

23:04.967 --> 23:06.052
I'm not telling.

23:06.052 --> 23:08.428
Then I guess you're just
gonna have to come back

23:08.428 --> 23:09.722
to the jail for the night.

23:09.722 --> 23:11.974
What? No, I can't go to jail.
Becky won't know where I am.

23:13.309 --> 23:15.393
Is Becky your sister?

23:17.271 --> 23:19.232
She's sick.

23:19.232 --> 23:21.399
Honey, you need
to take us to her

23:21.399 --> 23:22.442
so we can help her.

23:22.442 --> 23:24.528
-I can't.
-Well, why not, Cody?

23:24.528 --> 23:26.280
She says
if I tell anyone about us,

23:26.280 --> 23:27.740
they'll send us back.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.783
Did you run away from home?

23:31.451 --> 23:33.287
I don't have a home.

23:33.287 --> 23:35.831
I'm guessing you don't have
a mom or a dad either, do you?

23:38.334 --> 23:39.501
[Abigail] Please, Cody...

23:39.501 --> 23:43.881
I bet Becky is as hungry
as you were.

23:43.881 --> 23:46.926
A hot meal
would do her a lot of good.

23:49.803 --> 23:52.306
[♪♪♪]

23:54.267 --> 23:56.227
This way.

23:59.272 --> 24:00.231
What are they
doing here?

24:00.231 --> 24:01.357
[coughs deeply]

24:01.357 --> 24:02.691
We just
want to help.

24:02.691 --> 24:04.318
We don't
need your help.

24:04.318 --> 24:05.485
It's okay,
Becky.

24:05.485 --> 24:07.321
No, it's not.

24:07.321 --> 24:08.488
Oh...

24:08.488 --> 24:10.283
She's burning up
with fever.

24:10.283 --> 24:13.160
Okay, let's get
you out of here.

24:18.498 --> 24:20.834
I saw some other ones
this way.

24:20.834 --> 24:21.710
What was wrong

24:21.710 --> 24:23.503
with the last five
we looked at?

24:23.503 --> 24:25.172
Lee, the tree that we plant
in front of the church

24:25.172 --> 24:28.384
is going to be the centerpiece
of all the festivities!

24:28.384 --> 24:30.510
It has to be picture-perfect.

24:30.510 --> 24:31.511
You do realize,
of course,

24:31.511 --> 24:33.513
that these guys
are on the clock?

24:33.513 --> 24:37.393
Do you realize what
this story will do for us?

24:37.393 --> 24:38.727
People will read this story
and think

24:38.727 --> 24:41.230
what a wonderful community
we have,

24:41.230 --> 24:42.522
they will want to move here,

24:42.522 --> 24:44.524
and build homes
and open businesses.

24:44.524 --> 24:47.527
We're ensuring our town
has a future.

24:47.527 --> 24:49.238
Miss LeVeaux has a point
there, Mr. Coulter.

24:49.238 --> 24:51.531
Do not encourage
her, please.

24:51.531 --> 24:53.117
Thank you, Hickam.

24:53.117 --> 24:54.201
And who do you think

24:54.201 --> 24:55.786
they will buy lumber from
when they are

24:55.786 --> 24:57.997
building their houses
and opening their businesses?

24:57.997 --> 25:01.375
I do like when
you talk dollars and cents.

25:01.375 --> 25:02.542
Follow me, boys!

25:02.542 --> 25:04.295
Right behind you.

25:04.295 --> 25:05.545
You heard her.
Let's go.

25:05.545 --> 25:08.215
Let's get this
over with.

25:12.845 --> 25:14.763
See if you can
get some rest.

25:14.763 --> 25:16.890
Make sure she drinks
plenty of water.

25:16.890 --> 25:17.933
Yes, ma'am.

25:17.933 --> 25:21.020
I'll be downstairs
if you need anything.

25:22.562 --> 25:24.606
She seems nice.

25:24.606 --> 25:26.775
[coughing]

25:28.068 --> 25:29.695
It's okay.

25:31.864 --> 25:32.781
How is she?

25:32.781 --> 25:35.533
I'd feel better
if she saw a doctor.

25:35.533 --> 25:36.534
But Dr. Wilkins
doesn't make his rounds

25:36.534 --> 25:37.535
till after New Year's.

25:38.620 --> 25:41.581
Ned Yost said there's
a new hospital in Union City.

25:41.581 --> 25:43.042
I'm heading
to the mercantile now.

25:43.042 --> 25:43.834
I'll wire the hospital

25:43.834 --> 25:45.211
and see if
they can send someone.

25:45.211 --> 25:47.171
Thank you.

25:49.131 --> 25:50.757
Cody?

25:50.757 --> 25:52.926
Where
are you going?

25:52.926 --> 25:53.927
Back to the camp,

25:53.927 --> 25:55.971
but I'll come to see Becky
before dark.

25:55.971 --> 25:57.973
Well, it's awfully cold
out in the forest.

25:57.973 --> 25:59.599
Wouldn't you rather stay here
with your sister,

25:59.599 --> 26:01.185
where it's nice and warm?

26:04.188 --> 26:06.648
I only have
three pennies.

26:06.648 --> 26:08.192
How much
would it cost?

26:08.192 --> 26:10.069
Well, I'm a businesswoman,

26:10.069 --> 26:13.155
so maybe we could figure out
some kind of arrangement.

26:13.155 --> 26:14.907
I'm pretty good at chores!

26:14.907 --> 26:16.534
Oh! Maybe you could
do some chores,

26:16.534 --> 26:17.617
in exchange
for room and board?

26:17.617 --> 26:19.745
Could I earn enough
for apple pie at dinner?

26:19.745 --> 26:20.996
Can you make your bed?

26:20.996 --> 26:22.248
Sure can.

26:22.248 --> 26:23.707
Then pie is possible.

26:23.707 --> 26:25.501
Do we have a deal?

26:25.501 --> 26:27.378
Yes, ma'am!

26:27.378 --> 26:28.003
Deal!

26:30.630 --> 26:32.632
Good morning,
Miss Thatcher.

26:32.632 --> 26:34.592
Good morning,
Constable Thornton.

26:34.592 --> 26:35.719
Whatcha got
in the bag?

26:37.096 --> 26:38.638
Nothing.

26:38.638 --> 26:41.641
Just something I need to have
repaired at the mercantile.

26:41.641 --> 26:42.768
Oh, something
I can fix?

26:42.768 --> 26:43.852
No.

26:44.728 --> 26:46.313
It's nothing, really.

26:46.313 --> 26:49.066
Ah, it wouldn't have anything
to do with Rip, would it?

26:50.359 --> 26:52.778
[bag rustles]

26:54.654 --> 26:56.323
[chuckling]

26:56.323 --> 26:58.158
Your shoe.

26:58.158 --> 26:59.617
I think it's time
that he came home.

26:59.617 --> 27:01.454
No! That would be
admitting defeat.

27:01.454 --> 27:03.663
Oh, and Thatchers
never admit defeat.

27:03.663 --> 27:05.707
Never!

27:09.669 --> 27:11.671
What do you know
about Laura Campbell?

27:11.671 --> 27:13.673
I know she lost
her mother a few years back.

27:13.673 --> 27:14.674
It's been hard
for 'em.

27:14.674 --> 27:16.260
I can tell.

27:16.260 --> 27:17.677
Jed's a good man.

27:17.677 --> 27:19.679
He works from sun-up
to sundown,

27:19.679 --> 27:23.142
but I don't think there's
a lot of joy in that family.

27:24.268 --> 27:26.479
[♪♪♪]

27:29.273 --> 27:31.191
[door opens]

27:31.191 --> 27:33.277
[door closes]

27:38.532 --> 27:41.285
Abigail sent over
breakfast for you.

27:41.285 --> 27:42.744
That's very kind.

27:42.744 --> 27:44.955
Make sure
you thank her for me.

27:50.752 --> 27:53.005
Houston's the one
who's dirty.

27:53.005 --> 27:54.298
Not me.

27:54.298 --> 27:56.842
Houston has been a Mountie
for over 20 years, Bill.

27:56.842 --> 27:58.718
My father knew him.

27:58.718 --> 27:59.970
Doesn't mean he's clean.

27:59.970 --> 28:01.721
It just means he's gotten away
with it till now.

28:03.932 --> 28:05.725
I'm telling you
the truth, Jack.

28:05.725 --> 28:07.394
If you let him
take me tomorrow,

28:07.394 --> 28:08.646
there's not gonna be a trial.

28:08.646 --> 28:09.729
He'll put a bullet
in my back

28:09.729 --> 28:11.607
and convince everyone
I tried to run for it.

28:11.607 --> 28:13.400
Jack!

28:14.527 --> 28:16.320
I'm asking you to trust me.

28:22.201 --> 28:23.701
[Elizabeth] So the idea
for the art contest

28:23.701 --> 28:25.996
is to create a drawing
or painting

28:25.996 --> 28:28.499
that captures
the spirit of New Year's.

28:28.499 --> 28:29.707
What do you mean,
the "spirit"?

28:29.707 --> 28:31.210
How are you supposed
to draw something

28:31.210 --> 28:32.710
that you can't see?

28:32.710 --> 28:33.795
Well, it's not about
what you see,

28:33.795 --> 28:35.422
it's about what you feel.

28:35.422 --> 28:36.674
When I think
about New Year's,

28:36.674 --> 28:38.467
I think
about fireworks.

28:38.467 --> 28:40.010
It makes me
feel happy inside.

28:40.010 --> 28:42.388
Good. So I want you
to take those happy feelings

28:42.388 --> 28:44.097
and put them down
on paper.

28:44.097 --> 28:45.932
That picture
of Times Square

28:45.932 --> 28:47.184
makes me feel like
there's something

28:47.184 --> 28:49.645
big and exciting
gonna happen next year.

28:49.645 --> 28:52.105
Then draw "big and exciting".

28:54.358 --> 28:56.985
[♪♪♪]

28:56.985 --> 28:59.071
I don't know anyone
by the name of Landry.

28:59.071 --> 29:02.074
Well, Matt wrote and told me
he was in Hope Valley, but...

29:02.074 --> 29:04.910
doesn't seem like
anyone's ever heard of him.

29:04.910 --> 29:06.370
Is this Mr. Landry
a friend of yours?

29:06.370 --> 29:07.162
More than a friend.

29:07.162 --> 29:09.623
My dad took off
when I was 15.

29:09.623 --> 29:12.710
Left me to take care of my mom
and my little brother.

29:12.710 --> 29:14.127
That must've been difficult
for you.

29:14.127 --> 29:15.546
It was.

29:15.546 --> 29:17.839
But Matt loaned us some money
to get back on our feet,

29:17.839 --> 29:19.550
and, well, now
that the crop's come in,

29:19.550 --> 29:20.926
I wanted to pay him back.

29:20.926 --> 29:23.803
Start the New Year
with a clean slate.

29:23.803 --> 29:25.598
Maybe our constable
might know your friend.

29:25.598 --> 29:27.641
Have you met Jack Thornton?

29:27.641 --> 29:30.644
I don't think
I've had the pleasure.

29:30.644 --> 29:32.312
He usually comes in
around noon.

29:32.312 --> 29:34.147
Well, no sense
waiting.

29:34.147 --> 29:36.358
I'll go see
if I can find him.

29:36.358 --> 29:38.277
Thank you.

29:38.277 --> 29:40.279
Thank you.

29:42.822 --> 29:44.408
Who was
that young man?

29:44.408 --> 29:45.825
His name is Jesse.

29:45.825 --> 29:47.911
He's in town
looking for a friend.

29:47.911 --> 29:49.747
He's very handsome.

29:49.747 --> 29:51.665
Maybe Clara--

29:51.665 --> 29:54.376
Clara doesn't need us meddling
in her personal life, Florence.

29:54.376 --> 29:55.835
Everyone's personal life

29:55.835 --> 29:59.131
could use a little meddling
now and then.

30:00.507 --> 30:02.342
[laughs]

30:02.342 --> 30:04.595
[♪♪♪]

30:09.349 --> 30:10.559
Miss Thatcher,

30:10.559 --> 30:13.771
is there really gonna
be a war on New Year's?

30:13.771 --> 30:15.314
I don't
think so. Why?

30:15.314 --> 30:16.482
Someone said

30:16.482 --> 30:18.484
there was gonna be
a New Year's revolution.

30:18.484 --> 30:20.611
I think you mean "resolution."

30:20.611 --> 30:21.945
What's a resolution?

30:21.945 --> 30:24.406
A "resolution" is a promise
we make to ourselves

30:24.406 --> 30:27.242
to do something different
in the new year.

30:27.242 --> 30:28.285
I'm going to make

30:28.285 --> 30:29.119
a New Year's resolution
to read...

30:29.119 --> 30:30.287
That's a good one!

30:30.287 --> 30:31.371
...more Captain Billy

30:31.371 --> 30:33.540
and his
Bloody Pirate Adventures.

30:33.540 --> 30:34.874
[class laughing]

30:34.874 --> 30:36.502
How about

30:36.502 --> 30:39.546
a New Year's resolution to read
more Dickens or Shakespeare?

30:39.546 --> 30:41.298
[class groaning]

30:41.298 --> 30:43.883
All right, we can talk
more about that later,

30:43.883 --> 30:45.594
but, for now...

30:45.594 --> 30:46.886
class dismissed.

30:46.886 --> 30:47.929
[cow bell clanging]

30:47.929 --> 30:50.140
I'll see you after lunch.

30:52.267 --> 30:53.893
Laura?

30:53.893 --> 30:55.395
Why don't you take

30:55.395 --> 30:57.356
your assignment home with you
so you can work on it there?

30:58.940 --> 31:01.234
I can't.

31:06.573 --> 31:08.325
Mr. Campbell?

31:09.493 --> 31:12.204
May I speak with you
for a moment, about Laura?

31:14.289 --> 31:15.666
What about her?

31:15.666 --> 31:17.209
Oh, no, no, it's all right.

31:17.209 --> 31:19.919
She just doesn't seem
to want to do the art project

31:19.919 --> 31:21.672
I assigned in class today.

31:23.507 --> 31:26.426
I send my daughter
to school to learn.

31:26.426 --> 31:29.221
Well, there's more to learning
than just reading and writing.

31:29.221 --> 31:31.931
Pardon me for speaking plainly,
Miss Thatcher,

31:31.931 --> 31:32.932
but you don't understand

31:32.932 --> 31:35.977
what life is like
for people like us.

31:36.770 --> 31:39.981
We work for a living.

31:39.981 --> 31:41.316
Yes, but...

31:41.316 --> 31:44.944
being creative
is part of "work" for children.

31:44.944 --> 31:46.946
It teaches them
how to communicate

31:46.946 --> 31:48.948
and express themselves.

31:48.948 --> 31:51.410
That's your opinion.

31:52.952 --> 31:55.664
[♪♪♪]

32:00.960 --> 32:02.962
Avery says there's
two more sets of plates

32:02.962 --> 32:04.673
buried on
the north side of town.

32:04.673 --> 32:05.965
Oh?

32:05.965 --> 32:06.966
He'll show us
where they are,

32:06.966 --> 32:08.218
if the judge
grants him leniency.

32:08.218 --> 32:09.678
Well, personally,
I'd throw the book at him,

32:09.678 --> 32:12.347
but it's
up to the judge.

32:16.643 --> 32:18.019
Where is he?

32:25.277 --> 32:26.986
[sighing]

32:26.986 --> 32:28.906
I don't know,

32:28.906 --> 32:31.116
but I can guess
where he's headed.

32:36.705 --> 32:38.582
He's armed!

32:38.582 --> 32:40.500
Better take this.

32:40.500 --> 32:42.419
[♪♪♪]

32:56.015 --> 32:59.352
Her lungs are clear,
but her pulse is weak.

32:59.352 --> 33:02.188
I'll arrange for something
to get the fever down.

33:02.188 --> 33:03.690
Is she going to be okay?

33:03.690 --> 33:06.526
I'm fine, Cody.
Don't you worry.

33:06.526 --> 33:09.028
The best thing right now
for her is rest.

33:09.028 --> 33:11.030
I'll be back later
to check on her.

33:11.030 --> 33:12.950
Thank you, Doctor.

33:16.578 --> 33:19.122
Well... Cody?

33:19.122 --> 33:21.875
Would you like to come
with me to school?

33:21.875 --> 33:23.209
No.

33:23.209 --> 33:25.044
All children who stay
in my house go to school,

33:25.044 --> 33:26.797
and they take a bath
before they go.

33:26.797 --> 33:28.047
I hate baths.

33:28.047 --> 33:30.300
I'll heat the water.

33:30.300 --> 33:32.302
I hate school.

33:32.302 --> 33:34.053
We're rehearsing
a special program

33:34.053 --> 33:36.097
for the New Year's Eve
celebration.

33:36.097 --> 33:37.140
Could Cody be in it?

33:37.140 --> 33:39.058
He sings really good.

33:39.058 --> 33:40.727
I'm not that good.

33:40.727 --> 33:42.855
Well, I'm sure
we could find you something.

33:42.855 --> 33:45.106
And when you're feeling better,
you can come and see him.

33:45.106 --> 33:47.526
I wouldn't miss it
for anything.

33:51.613 --> 33:54.992
Set it down
and step away.

33:57.703 --> 33:59.454
Don't let him do this, Jack.
I told you--

33:59.454 --> 34:01.331
Do what he says, Bill.

34:05.502 --> 34:06.378

34:20.684 --> 34:22.060
Over there.

34:24.437 --> 34:27.691
It's a shame Avery killed you
before I could shoot him.

34:27.691 --> 34:29.568
Let him go.
I'm the one you want.

34:29.568 --> 34:30.903
Sorry. I can't leave
any loose ends,

34:30.903 --> 34:31.695
but not to worry, Jack--

34:31.695 --> 34:34.031
I'll tell everyone
you died a hero.

34:36.115 --> 34:37.450
But not you.

to pull the trigger.

No problem, Miss LeVeaux.

34:59.681 --> 35:00.974
Yes! There.
That's good. Now...

35:00.974 --> 35:02.976
A tad more towards me?

You heard the lady.

Yes! There!

-It's perfect.
-Okay.

There we go. Oh.

35:16.155 --> 35:18.116
Hmm.

35:19.492 --> 35:21.828
[exhales] Ah!

35:23.204 --> 35:25.082
What's wrong now?

The sun...

35:26.374 --> 35:28.961
I don't want the tree
to be backlit.

35:28.961 --> 35:31.671
Well... can't move
the sun, Rosemary.

That's why we need
to move the tree.

Where would
you like it?

Not so fast.

35:37.761 --> 35:39.345
Every time we move the tree,

35:39.345 --> 35:41.180
you give us another reason
to move it again.

35:41.180 --> 35:42.348
But trust me...

35:42.348 --> 35:45.184
This is it.
This is beautiful!

is a photograph
of you and your husband.

Yes, Ma'am.

a "Frontier Family New Year"

the two of you, now, can I?

your mind yet?

Nice to meet you.

36:53.586 --> 36:56.048
If you're a pastor,
shouldn't you be in church?

36:56.048 --> 36:57.549
Oh, Miss Thatcher
uses the church

36:57.549 --> 36:59.425
as her schoolroom
during the week.

36:59.425 --> 37:01.136
So where do you go?

37:01.136 --> 37:03.096
Anywhere I'm needed.

How does God know
where to find you?

he found his way

37:29.247 --> 37:31.290
A lot of people
wouldn't be so generous.

Well, you're supposed
to be in class.

38:23.093 --> 38:24.677
My dad needs help
pulling the weeds.

38:24.677 --> 38:27.139
I'm sure that can wait
until after school.

Do you really think

38:50.495 --> 38:51.997
It says right here
in the rules.

38:51.997 --> 38:53.665
On the back page,
in fine print.

38:53.665 --> 38:55.000
Who reads
the fine print?

38:55.000 --> 38:56.793
It's usually
a pretty good idea.

38:56.793 --> 38:59.378
This whole marriage thing
is just a small technicality.

38:59.378 --> 39:01.131
"Technicality"?

39:01.131 --> 39:02.381
We just have to
pretend to be married

39:02.381 --> 39:03.549
for a couple of days.

39:03.549 --> 39:04.676
Mr. Ward won't even
know the difference.

39:04.676 --> 39:06.344
I'll know the difference.

39:07.595 --> 39:11.891
This New Year's Eve celebration
is so important to the town.

39:11.891 --> 39:12.976

a dozen items
for the memory box.

39:18.397 --> 39:20.399
Oh, and they're so excited
about the fireworks!

39:20.399 --> 39:21.693
You wouldn't want to
disappoint the children,

39:21.693 --> 39:23.361
now, would you, Lee?

39:23.361 --> 39:25.404
"The children"? Really?

39:30.409 --> 39:32.662
You are going to owe me.

39:32.662 --> 39:34.497
Is that a yes?

39:34.497 --> 39:36.541
I suppose so. Yes.

39:36.541 --> 39:38.084
Now, just don't be late
for the interview.

Whoa! Whoa.

39:38.835 --> 39:40.212
What interview?

39:40.212 --> 39:42.172
Well, Mr. Ward wants
to know all about us.

39:42.172 --> 39:43.298
Not to worry.

39:43.298 --> 39:44.465
I'll take the lead.

39:44.465 --> 39:46.968
You just agree
with everything I say.

39:46.968 --> 39:48.720
Great.
What else is new?

39:51.014 --> 39:53.016
Oh, boy.

39:55.685 --> 39:58.063
"Pastor Frank Hogan."

39:58.063 --> 40:00.398
[laughs] I never
would've figured that.

40:04.443 --> 40:05.987
Oh, don't look

40:05.987 --> 40:08.323
so surprised
to see me, Matt.

40:08.323 --> 40:09.824
I did my time.

40:09.824 --> 40:11.450
How'd you find me?

40:11.450 --> 40:12.535
Almost sounds as if

40:12.535 --> 40:13.995
you didn't want
to be found.

40:13.995 --> 40:15.454
What do you want, Jesse?

40:15.454 --> 40:17.749
Can't I look up
an old friend?

40:17.749 --> 40:20.877
Heck, you were like
a father to me.

40:20.877 --> 40:23.462
Didn't set
much of an example.

40:23.462 --> 40:25.631
You kidding me?

40:25.631 --> 40:28.718
Everybody wanted
to be like you.

40:28.718 --> 40:31.596
The legendary Matt Landry.

40:31.596 --> 40:33.472
Matt Landry's
dead and buried.

40:33.472 --> 40:35.474
And I got work to do.

40:35.474 --> 40:36.768
You don't really
think I'm buying

40:36.768 --> 40:39.478
this holier-than-thou
act, do you?

40:39.478 --> 40:40.939
Whatever you got
going on here,

40:40.939 --> 40:42.565
I want a piece of it.

40:42.565 --> 40:43.983
The only thing I got going on

40:43.983 --> 40:46.485
is serving the people
of Hope Valley as their pastor.

40:46.485 --> 40:47.695
Can't fool me, Matt.

40:47.695 --> 40:49.281
Good try, though.

40:49.281 --> 40:50.365
It's not a bad
way of life, Jesse.

40:50.365 --> 40:52.491
Maybe it's time
you turned over a new leaf.

40:52.491 --> 40:53.659
[laughs]

40:53.659 --> 40:55.453
That's a good one.

40:56.495 --> 40:59.249
[♪♪♪]

41:00.208 --> 41:03.461
Or maybe it's time
you got out of town.

41:04.503 --> 41:07.173
Well, that's not
a very friendly attitude.

41:07.173 --> 41:08.716
These are good people
here, Jesse.

41:08.716 --> 41:09.926
I don't want any trouble.

41:09.926 --> 41:12.511
[♪♪♪]

41:15.473 --> 41:16.849
You know,

41:16.849 --> 41:19.060
I think I'll be sticking
around for a while.

41:19.060 --> 41:22.188
Kinda like the scenery.

41:23.315 --> 41:25.483
