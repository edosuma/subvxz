WEBVTT

00:05.005 --> 00:08.507
I AM CALM.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.042
I AM RELAXED.

00:10.044 --> 00:13.145
I AM A HAPPY TREE.

00:13.147 --> 00:14.680
( thuds loudly )

00:14.682 --> 00:19.818
YOU ARE MAKING IT VERY HARD
TO BE A HAPPY TREE!

00:19.820 --> 00:22.921
SORRY, LIV, I'M JUST--
I'M LOSING MY MIND

00:22.923 --> 00:24.857
WAITING FOR THIS LETTER
THAT WILL TELL ME

00:24.859 --> 00:26.558
IF I MADE TRYOUTS
FOR THE JUNIOR OLYMPICS.

00:26.560 --> 00:28.260
JUNIOR OLYMPICS.

00:28.262 --> 00:30.129
IT'S JUST THE CHANCE
TO PLAY BASKETBALL

00:30.131 --> 00:33.065
FOR MY COUNTRY AND TRAVEL
THE WORLD FOR A YEAR

00:33.067 --> 00:36.068
AND SCORE A BANGIN'
TEAM USA DUFFEL BAG.

00:36.070 --> 00:38.537
YOU KNOW WHAT--
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

00:38.539 --> 00:40.172
IT'S THE BIGGEST DEAL EVER.

00:40.174 --> 00:42.274
BAM.  WHAT?!

00:42.276 --> 00:44.943
I JUST GOT HOME
AND NOW SHE MIGHT BE LEAVING

00:44.945 --> 00:47.012
FOR SOME ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME
OPPORTUNITY

00:47.014 --> 00:49.615
TO REPRESENT OUR COUNTRY
AS A JUNIOR OLYMPIAN?

00:49.617 --> 00:50.282
( scoffs )

00:50.284 --> 00:51.917
HOW SELFISH CAN SHE BE?

00:52.852 --> 00:54.319
MADDIE, I TOTALLY HOPE

00:54.321 --> 00:55.654
YOU DO GET TO DO
YOUR BASKETBALL AUDITION.

00:55.656 --> 00:56.789
( chuckles, snorts )

00:56.791 --> 00:58.557
OKAY, WELL,
IT'S CALLED A TRYOUT.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.225
WELL, WHATEVER
IT IS CALLED,

01:00.227 --> 01:01.693
I HOPE YOU BREAK A LEG.

01:01.695 --> 01:02.895
( laughs )

01:02.897 --> 01:04.930
MADDIE.

01:04.932 --> 01:06.131
THIS WAS ON THE PORCH.

01:06.133 --> 01:07.666
( exclaims )
MY LETTER!

01:07.668 --> 01:09.568
I'M GOING TO THROW UP.
OKAY.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.303
OKAY... YOU OPEN IT.

01:11.305 --> 01:13.105
DON'T TOUCH IT!
OKAY.

01:13.107 --> 01:17.042
OKAY.
READY?

01:17.044 --> 01:20.579
SOCKS?

01:20.581 --> 01:23.649
"YOU HAVE BEEN PRANKED
BY JOEY."

01:24.918 --> 01:26.585
( laughing )

01:26.587 --> 01:28.187
BOOYAH!

01:29.889 --> 01:33.292
( chuckling )
SHOULD BE BOOYAH.

02:34.355 --> 02:36.688
WHERE'S YOUR DEFENSE,
LITTLE MAN?

02:38.191 --> 02:41.426
IT IS THREE FEET
BELOW YOUR SHOULDERS,

02:41.428 --> 02:43.929
THAT'S WHERE.

02:43.931 --> 02:46.198
HOW IS THIS EVEN
FUN FOR YOU?

02:46.200 --> 02:47.266
I'M DONE HERE.

02:47.268 --> 02:49.067
OH, COME ON.
ONE MORE?

02:49.069 --> 02:50.335
I'M JUST TRYING TO KEEP
MY MIND OFF MADDIE

02:50.337 --> 02:51.403
AND THE JUNIOR OLYMPICS.

02:51.405 --> 02:52.971
I REALLY DON'T WANT HER
TO LEAVE.

02:52.973 --> 02:54.173
HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING?

02:54.175 --> 02:56.341
I KEEP MY NOSE
OUT OF SUCH AFFAIRS.

02:57.844 --> 02:59.111
COME ON.
ONE MORE GAME?

02:59.113 --> 03:01.413
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GET
JOEY TO PLAY WITH YOU?

03:01.415 --> 03:03.315
HE'S NOT LEAVING
FOR HIS POTTERY CLASS

03:03.317 --> 03:05.250
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

03:05.252 --> 03:07.786
WAIT A MINUTE--
POTTERY CLASS?

03:07.788 --> 03:12.057
HE TOLD ME HE WAS
MEETING WITH HIS ZOMBIE
APPRECIATION SOCIETY.

03:12.059 --> 03:14.092
WAIT, HE'S LYING TO US?

03:14.094 --> 03:17.963
WHY WOULD YOU LIE ABOUT
DOING EITHER OF THOSE THINGS?

03:17.965 --> 03:20.766
UNLESS YOU'RE DOING
SOMETHING EVEN MORE PATHETIC.

03:20.768 --> 03:23.402
WHAT DO YOU THINK
HE'S UP TO?

03:23.404 --> 03:27.105
JUST WHEN YOU THINK YOU HAVE
A MUNCH ALL FIGURED OUT,

03:27.107 --> 03:29.408
HE THROWS YOU A CURVEBALL.

03:29.410 --> 03:33.345
MAYBE HE HAS
A SECRET GIRLFRIEND.

03:33.347 --> 03:35.747
( both laughing )

03:37.717 --> 03:39.318
OKAY, LOOK--
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT

03:39.320 --> 03:40.452
WHAT JOEY'S HIDING.

03:40.454 --> 03:42.254
LAST TIME
HE HAD A SECRET,

03:42.256 --> 03:45.857
I WOKE UP WITH
64 WHITE MICE IN MY BED.

03:45.859 --> 03:47.960
WAIT, SO ARE YOU SAYING
THIS IS AN AFFAIR

03:47.962 --> 03:49.361
YOU WOULD
STICK YOUR NOSE IN?

03:49.363 --> 03:51.363
AH, DIGGIE--

03:51.365 --> 03:53.131
MY NOSE GOES
WHERE IT'S NEEDED.

03:57.437 --> 03:59.738
HEY, ROONEY.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.506
DID YOU HEAR ANYTHING FROM
THE JUNIOR OLYMPICS PEOPLE?

04:01.508 --> 04:03.508
AH, NO.
STILL NO LETTER.

04:03.510 --> 04:05.377
- WOW, SERIOUSLY?
- I SAID NO LETTER!

04:08.348 --> 04:10.349
I'M SORRY,
I WAS JUST HOPING

04:10.351 --> 04:11.450
FOR GOOD NEWS
ABOUT THE TRYOUTS.

04:11.452 --> 04:15.187
OKAY, SO YOU'RE SAYING YOU WANT
ME TO MOVE AWAY FOR A YEAR?

04:15.189 --> 04:17.389
THAT'S NOT WHAT
I'M SAYING AT ALL.

04:17.391 --> 04:18.857
OH, OKAY.

04:18.859 --> 04:20.158
SO THEN YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO MAKE THE TEAM?

04:20.160 --> 04:24.463
OH, WOW.  NO.
I WANT WHAT YOU WANT.

04:24.465 --> 04:25.797
MM-HMM.

04:25.799 --> 04:28.400
EXACTLY AS MUCH
AS YOU WANT IT.

04:30.503 --> 04:32.104
HEY, MADDIE.

04:32.106 --> 04:33.272
HEAR ANYTHING
FROM JUNIOR OLYMPICS?

04:33.274 --> 04:36.308
NO!  I SWEAR,
IF ONE MORE PERSON...

04:36.310 --> 04:37.809
HEY, MADDIE!

04:37.811 --> 04:39.077
DID YOU HEAR--

04:43.883 --> 04:46.218
<i>( loud thuds )</i>

04:47.820 --> 04:49.121
YES.

04:49.123 --> 04:51.189
THANK YOU FOR TAKING
THE BOUNCING UPSTAIRS, MADDIE.

04:51.191 --> 04:53.091
IT IS SO MUCH BETTER!

04:54.327 --> 04:55.527
Maddie:  <i>SORRY.</i>

04:55.529 --> 04:57.829
ANY SIGN OF THE MAIL?

04:57.831 --> 05:00.499
- NO.
-   <i>( loud thuds resume )</i>

05:00.501 --> 05:02.901
YOU KNOW WHAT--
I'LL CHECK AGAIN.

05:02.903 --> 05:05.504
EVEN THOUGH IT'S ONLY
BEEN EIGHT MINUTES

05:05.506 --> 05:07.906
SINCE THE LAST TIME.

05:07.908 --> 05:10.375
I'M SURE THE MAILMAN
IS STANDING RIGHT THERE

05:10.377 --> 05:12.978
ABOUT TO KNOCK.

05:14.347 --> 05:16.948
GOT A CERTIFIED LETTER
FOR MADDIE ROONEY.

05:16.950 --> 05:18.216
OKAY.

05:18.218 --> 05:20.185
HAVE A GOOD DAY.
BYE.

05:22.121 --> 05:24.323
JUNIOR OLYMPICS.

05:24.325 --> 05:25.857
Maddie:  <i>DID IT COME?</i>

05:25.859 --> 05:28.860
UM...

05:28.862 --> 05:31.396
DID YOU SEE THAT MOMENT
OF HESITATION

05:31.398 --> 05:33.465
WHERE I ALMOST DID
THE RIGHT THING?

05:33.467 --> 05:35.167
NO.

05:35.169 --> 05:37.302
NO MAIL HERE.

05:37.304 --> 05:39.037
IT WAS BRIEF.

05:39.039 --> 05:41.239
BUT IT WAS THERE.

05:46.412 --> 05:48.146
DUDE,
WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?

05:49.449 --> 05:51.383
WE ARE NOT FOLLOWING
JOEY INTO THE JUNGLE.

05:51.385 --> 05:53.885
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

05:53.887 --> 05:56.288
SO MADDIE MIGHT MOVE AWAY

05:56.290 --> 05:58.490
AND NOW YOU'RE DRESSED
LIKE A SHRUB.

06:00.293 --> 06:03.495
I GOT BIG PROBLEMS, KID.

06:03.497 --> 06:05.964
LEAVE THEM AT THE DOOR.

06:05.966 --> 06:07.399
WE HAVE WORK TO DO.

06:07.401 --> 06:10.369
I INSTALLED
A GPS TRACKING APP

06:10.371 --> 06:13.905
WOULD YOU BELIEVE
HIS PASSWORD WAS "1234"?

06:13.907 --> 06:15.307
WHAT A MUNCH.

06:15.309 --> 06:18.410
TOTAL MUNCH.

06:18.412 --> 06:21.012
HEY, CAN YOU TEACH ME
HOW TO CHANGE THE PASSWORD

06:21.014 --> 06:22.547
ON MY PHONE?

06:33.593 --> 06:36.161
<i>( beeping )</i>

06:36.163 --> 06:39.564
MY GPS APP JUST SAID
JOEY ENTERED THE SCHOOL.

06:40.933 --> 06:43.168
WE JUST SAW JOEY
ENTER THE SCHOOL.

06:43.170 --> 06:44.603
I KNOW.

06:44.605 --> 06:46.338
THIS THING'S GOOD, HUH?

06:53.213 --> 06:56.348
WHO WOULD MYSTERIOUSLY
SNEAK OUT AT NIGHT

06:56.350 --> 06:57.549
JUST TO COME BACK
TO SCHOOL?

06:57.551 --> 07:00.285
A TEENAGE SUPERHERO
WHO USES RIDGEWOOD HIGH

07:00.287 --> 07:03.088
AS HIS BAT CAVE.

07:03.090 --> 07:05.490
I KNEW HIS DORKINESS
WAS JUST TOO DORKY

07:05.492 --> 07:07.292
TO BE ANYTHING
BUT A SECRET IDENTITY.

07:07.294 --> 07:10.495
DUDE, I CAN'T BELIEVE
I HAVE TO SAY THIS OUT LOUD,

07:10.497 --> 07:12.397
BUT JOEY IS NOT
A SUPERHERO.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.301
NOW I'M EMBARRASSED
I BROUGHT IT UP.

07:19.439 --> 07:20.439
SOMEONE'S COMING.

07:20.441 --> 07:22.140
HIDE!  HIDE!

07:31.951 --> 07:34.219
BOOM!  JUNGLE.

07:35.354 --> 07:37.456
YOU'RE WELCOME.

08:01.247 --> 08:02.547
WHAT ARE YOU TWO
DOING HERE?

08:02.549 --> 08:06.585
WE'RE SUPERHEROES
AND THIS IS OUR BAT CAVE?

08:11.357 --> 08:13.358
I DIDN'T OPEN
MADDIE'S LETTER,

08:13.360 --> 08:16.461
BUT I STRUGGLED FOR HOURS
ABOUT WHAT TO DO WITH IT.

08:16.463 --> 08:17.729
IN THE END, I DECIDED

08:17.731 --> 08:20.198
THERE REALLY ONLY WAS
ONE RIGHT THING TO DO.

08:20.200 --> 08:23.502
HIDE IT LONG ENOUGH
FOR HER TO MISS TRYOUTS.

08:23.504 --> 08:25.337
YEAH, IT TURNS OUT
THAT THE TOILET TANK

08:25.339 --> 08:27.405
IS NOT A GREAT HIDING PLACE.

08:31.210 --> 08:34.145
MM, AND...

08:34.147 --> 08:35.413
THERE.

08:35.415 --> 08:37.048
OH, HAIR DRYER.

08:37.050 --> 08:39.284
IS THERE ANY PROBLEM
YOU CAN'T SOLVE?

08:41.454 --> 08:43.288
<i>F-Y-INFORMATION,</i>

08:43.290 --> 08:45.156
LIFE IS GOING TO GET
A LOT MORE COMPLICATED

FOR YOU BOTH
WHEN YOU GROW UP.

08:47.094 --> 08:48.627
<i>( knocking at door )</i>

08:48.629 --> 08:50.395
Karen:  <i>LIV, HONEY,</i>

UH...

08:53.467 --> 08:57.035
( murmuring )

09:02.675 --> 09:04.276
OKAY, YEAH.
COME ON IN.

09:04.278 --> 09:07.145
HEY.

09:07.147 --> 09:08.647
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

09:08.649 --> 09:10.682
OH!  SO GOOD.
I AM PHENOMENAL.

09:10.684 --> 09:12.517
I AM JUST GREAT.

09:12.519 --> 09:13.818
<i>( loud thuds )</i>

09:13.820 --> 09:16.388

POOR MADDIE HAS BEEN

09:16.390 --> 09:18.523
OUT ON THAT BASKETBALL COURT
ALL NIGHT.

09:18.525 --> 09:21.526
SHE IS SO ANXIOUS WAITING
FOR THIS LETTER TO ARRIVE.

09:21.528 --> 09:23.562
IT'S JUST CRUEL THAT
THEY MAKE HER WAIT SO LONG.

09:23.564 --> 09:25.764
IT IS SO CRUEL.

09:25.766 --> 09:27.732
<i>( louder thuds )</i>

09:29.335 --> 09:31.102
( sighs )

09:31.104 --> 09:33.438
I HAVE JUST BEEN
A NERVOUS WRECK

09:33.440 --> 09:35.473
THINKING ABOUT
ANOTHER ONE OF MY BABIES

09:35.475 --> 09:36.675
LEAVING THE NEST.

09:36.677 --> 09:38.476
BUT YOU,
YOU'RE RIGHT THERE.

09:38.478 --> 09:40.345
SUPPORTING YOUR SISTER.

09:40.347 --> 09:42.347
IT'S JUST LIKE THIS
PICTURE YOU TWO MADE.

09:42.349 --> 09:45.417
"SISTERS BY CHANCE,
FRIENDS BY CHOICE."

09:45.419 --> 09:49.120
YOU KNOW... YOU GIRLS
LIVE THAT EVERY DAY.

09:49.122 --> 09:50.622
EVERY DAY?

09:50.624 --> 09:54.192
HA HA!
TWICE ON SUNDAYS.

09:54.194 --> 09:56.428
OH, I REMEMBER THE NIGHT

09:56.430 --> 09:58.597
YOU WERE LEAVING
FOR HOLLYWOOD.

10:04.337 --> 10:07.172
( sighing )

10:07.174 --> 10:09.274
MOM, MOM,
GUESS WHAT.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.442
WHAT IS IT, MADDIE?

10:10.444 --> 10:12.410
WE PLAYED BASKETBALL
AT RECESS TODAY

10:12.412 --> 10:14.212
AND I WAS BETTER
THAN EVERYONE.

10:14.214 --> 10:15.614
EVEN THE BOYS.
BAM!

10:15.616 --> 10:16.748
- WHAT?
- BAM!

10:16.750 --> 10:18.750
WHAT?

10:18.752 --> 10:20.819
OOH, I LIKE THAT.

10:20.821 --> 10:22.387
BAM!  WHAT?!

10:28.861 --> 10:31.630
WHAT IS HAPPENING?

10:31.632 --> 10:35.166
JOEY, PARKER JUST
FOLLOWS YOU AROUND

10:35.168 --> 10:36.768
BECAUSE HE WORSHIPS
THE GROUND YOU WALK ON.

10:36.770 --> 10:39.304
IT IS CUTE THAT HE CAN'T
TAKE HIS EYES OFF OF YOU.

10:39.306 --> 10:42.707
SO THAT'S WHY HE POOPS
WITH THE DOOR OPEN.

10:42.709 --> 10:45.510
HE'LL GROW OUT OF THAT.

10:47.813 --> 10:49.414
APPRECIATE THE OFFER.

10:49.416 --> 10:50.415
WHAT OFFER?

10:50.417 --> 10:52.817
BLUETOOTHIN', BABE

10:54.454 --> 10:57.155

AUNT DINA'S NUMBER

10:57.157 --> 10:59.457
IN CASE YOU NEED
TO GET AHOLD OF US IN L.A.

10:59.459 --> 11:00.458
KEEP IT SOMEPLACE SAFE.

11:00.460 --> 11:03.294
GOT IT.

11:03.296 --> 11:05.897
THERE SHE IS.
LOOK OUT, HOLLYWOOD.

11:05.899 --> 11:09.401
IT IS LIV ROONEY.

11:09.403 --> 11:11.569
I HAD THE MOST
AMAZE-A-LICIOUS IDEA.

11:11.571 --> 11:13.738
INSTEAD OF SAYING
THE NAME OF MY SHOW,

11:13.740 --> 11:15.473
I SHOULD ALWAYS SING IT.

11:15.475 --> 11:18.376
♪ SING IT LOUD!

11:19.912 --> 11:22.614
THAT'S GONNA GET OLD.

11:22.616 --> 11:24.382
GONNA?

11:24.384 --> 11:26.351
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.386
TIME TO TAKE MOM
AND LIV TO THE AIRPORT.

11:28.388 --> 11:31.423
WAIT.
I NEED A TWIN MOMENT.

11:31.425 --> 11:32.657
ARE THEY GONNA HUG
OR FIGHT?

11:32.659 --> 11:34.392
I NEVER KNOW.

11:34.394 --> 11:37.462
LOOK, I COULD BE GONE
FOR A LONG TIME.

11:37.464 --> 11:39.397
YOU SAY THE WORD
AND I WON'T LEAVE.

11:39.399 --> 11:40.832
YOU HAVE TO GO, LIV.

11:40.834 --> 11:42.500
I'M GOING TO MISS YOU.

11:42.502 --> 11:44.469
BUT THIS IS YOUR DREAM.

11:46.372 --> 11:48.740
THANKS.  THAT MEANS
EVERYTHING TO ME.

11:48.742 --> 11:50.842
NOW GO OUT
AND SHOW HOLLYWOOD

11:50.844 --> 11:52.711
HOW WE DO IT
IN STEVENS POINT.

11:52.713 --> 11:55.547
BAM!  WHAT?!

11:55.549 --> 11:57.682
YEAH, DON'T DO THAT.

11:58.851 --> 12:00.518
( both chuckle )

12:02.855 --> 12:04.456
WOW.
( laughs )

12:04.458 --> 12:06.324
THANK YOU, MOM.

12:06.326 --> 12:08.860
REALLY NEEDED THAT REMINDER
OF HOW SELFLESS MY SISTER WAS.

12:08.862 --> 12:12.263
I WOULD BE A MONSTER NOT
TO DO THE SAME THING FOR HER.

12:12.265 --> 12:14.799
OH, A HIDEOUS MONSTER.

12:18.604 --> 12:19.838
ALL RIGHTY.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.372
YOU FIGURED OUT
MY SECRET.

12:21.374 --> 12:22.907
I'M IN A DRUM CIRCLE.

12:22.909 --> 12:25.543
WE'RE CALLED
THE BUCKETSTREET BOYS.

12:26.645 --> 12:29.414
GO AHEAD.
MAKE FUN.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.583
JOEY, THAT WAS AWESOME.

12:31.585 --> 12:34.519
AND YOU KNOW I DIE
A LITTLE INSIDE

12:34.521 --> 12:36.020
EVERY TIME I COMPLIMENT YOU.

12:37.690 --> 12:39.524
I WAS REALLY
IMPRESSED TOO, JOE.

12:39.526 --> 12:41.626
YEAH, NO ONE'S TAKING YOU
SERIOUSLY RIGHT NOW, DIGGIE.

12:42.428 --> 12:44.496
STAND DOWN, SOLDIER.

12:44.498 --> 12:46.931
STAND DOWN.

12:46.933 --> 12:50.368
SO WHAT'S WITH
THE SNEAKING AROUND?

12:50.370 --> 12:52.904
WELL, YOU KNOW, SOME OF
MY GUYS ARE A LITTLE SHY.

12:55.474 --> 12:57.509
A LOT SHY.

12:58.511 --> 13:00.712
SO WE'VE BEEN REHEARSING
IN PRIVATE.

13:00.714 --> 13:02.847
BUT WE'RE GOING PUBLIC
TOMORROW

13:02.849 --> 13:05.550
BETWEEN FIFTH
AND SIXTH PERIOD.

13:05.552 --> 13:08.052
WHOA-- THAT'S HALLWAY
RUSH HOUR.

13:08.054 --> 13:09.521
THAT'S THE POINT.

13:09.523 --> 13:11.856
WE'RE GONNA STOP TRAFFIC
WITH OUR INSTA-JAM

13:11.858 --> 13:15.627
AND PICK UP
SOME INSTA-HALLWAY CRED.

13:16.662 --> 13:19.364
THAT'S COOL.
I MEAN, YOU JUST BECAME

13:19.366 --> 13:21.366
SLIGHTLY LESS MUNCHY.

13:22.701 --> 13:24.402
I JUST DON'T GET
WHY YOU KEEP

13:24.404 --> 13:25.570
THE ONE THING
YOU DO WELL A SECRET.

13:25.572 --> 13:27.739
( scoffs )
ONE THING.

13:27.741 --> 13:30.508
CLEARLY YOU HAVE NEVER
SEEN ME GIVE MEDICINE

13:30.510 --> 13:32.544
TO A CAT.

13:34.914 --> 13:37.549
<i>( loud thuds )</i>

13:44.356 --> 13:46.324
MADDIE COULDN'T SLEEP SO SHE
WAS PRACTICING FREE THROWS.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.826
WHATEVER THOSE ARE.

13:47.828 --> 13:50.495
AND HAVE YOU EVER NOTICED
HOW A BOUNCING BASKETBALL

13:50.497 --> 13:52.530
SOUNDS LIKE GUILTY SECRETS
TRYING TO POUND

13:52.532 --> 13:54.499
THEIR WAY
OUT OF YOUR SKULL?

13:54.501 --> 13:55.667
<i>( thuds continue )</i>

13:55.669 --> 13:58.369
Young Liv:
<i>SISTERS BY CHANCE...</i>

13:58.371 --> 13:59.637
Young Maddie:
<i>FRIENDS BY CHOICE.</i>

13:59.639 --> 14:01.840
Young Liv:
<i>SISTERS BY CHANCE...</i>

14:01.842 --> 14:03.741
Young Maddie:
<i>FRIENDS BY CHOICE.</i>

14:03.743 --> 14:07.512
WHAT... IS... HAPPENING?

14:08.514 --> 14:10.548
SISTERS BY CHANCE...

14:10.550 --> 14:11.950
FRIENDS BY CHOICE.

14:11.952 --> 14:13.751
<i>SISTERS BY CHANCE...</i>

14:13.753 --> 14:15.119
<i>FRIENDS BY CHOICE.</i>

14:15.121 --> 14:19.023
Both: SISTERS BY CHANCE,
FRIENDS BY CHOICE.

14:20.426 --> 14:21.626
I FELT LIKE THE PICTURE

14:21.628 --> 14:23.528
WAS TRYING
TO TELL ME SOMETHING.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.096
AND IT SEEMS TO ME

14:25.098 --> 14:26.698
THAT IF A PICTURE
COMES TO LIFE,

14:26.700 --> 14:28.600
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
LISTEN TO IT.

14:29.568 --> 14:31.502
Both: GIVE HER THE LETTER!

14:31.504 --> 14:33.771
FINE.

14:33.773 --> 14:35.106
BUT YOU HAD BETTER
BE ASLEEP

14:35.108 --> 14:37.375
BY THE TIME I GET BACK,
YOUNG LADIES.

14:41.413 --> 14:42.647
MADDIE!

14:42.649 --> 14:43.982
<i>LOOK WHAT JUST CAME.</i>
<i>( squeals )</i>

14:43.984 --> 14:45.650
IT'S YOUR LETTER
FROM THE JUNIOR OLYMPICS.

14:45.652 --> 14:47.418
OH, FINALLY!

14:47.420 --> 14:49.554
( laughs )

14:51.457 --> 14:52.757
WAIT, THIS JUST GOT HERE?

14:52.759 --> 14:54.158
IT'S MIDNIGHT.

14:54.160 --> 14:57.528
YEAH.  YEAH.

14:57.530 --> 14:59.497
YEAH, IT'S THIS NEW FEATURE

14:59.499 --> 15:01.032
THAT THE POST OFFICE HAS

15:01.034 --> 15:02.767
WHERE THEY WAIT
UNTIL THE LAST SECOND

15:02.769 --> 15:05.470
TO DELIVER SOMETHING IMPORTANT
TO BUILD EXCITEMENT.

15:05.472 --> 15:06.704
IT'S CALLED...

15:06.706 --> 15:09.641
IT'S CALLED "ANTICI-POST."

15:09.643 --> 15:11.175
LIV...

15:11.177 --> 15:14.412
WHEN DID THIS LETTER
REALLY GET HERE?

15:14.414 --> 15:16.147
OKAY, SO IT GOT HERE
THIS MORNING.

15:16.149 --> 15:17.615
WHAT?!

15:17.617 --> 15:18.917
YOU HAD THIS ALL DAY?

15:18.919 --> 15:22.020
HEY!  YOU CANNOT BLAME
THE MESSENGER.

15:22.022 --> 15:23.454
WELL, I CAN
IF THE MESSENGER

15:23.456 --> 15:25.523
NEVER GAVE ME
THE MESSAGE.

15:25.525 --> 15:27.992
NOW, WHAT IS GOING ON
OUT HERE?

15:27.994 --> 15:30.528
LIV HID MY JUNIOR OLYMPICS
LETTER ALL DAY!

15:30.530 --> 15:33.197
WHAT?!
OLIVIA ROONEY.

15:33.199 --> 15:34.866
YEAH, YOU SEE THAT--

15:34.868 --> 15:36.868
THAT IS THE FACE
OF AN APPALLED MOTHER.

15:36.870 --> 15:40.438
YOU APPALLED HER
BECAUSE YOU ARE APPALLING.

15:41.640 --> 15:43.808
I WOULDN'T SAY
MOM LOOKED APPALLED.

15:43.810 --> 15:45.143
SHE JUST LOOKS KIND OF
WORN OUT.

15:45.145 --> 15:46.644
( sputters )

15:46.646 --> 15:49.480
LIV, YOU TRIED
TO SABOTAGE ME.

15:49.482 --> 15:52.116
I WOULD NEVER SABOTAGE
YOUR DREAM LIKE THAT.

15:53.552 --> 15:55.653
WELL, NOW, MADISON,
THAT'S NOT TOTALLY TRUE.

15:56.989 --> 15:59.090
DO YOU REMEMBER
FIVE YEARS AGO?

15:59.092 --> 16:00.758
LIV'S AUDITION DVD?

16:00.760 --> 16:03.995
WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT
FIVE YEARS AGO, KAREN.

16:05.464 --> 16:09.200
NO, I THINK I'D LIKE
TO HEAR KAREN'S STORY.

16:12.504 --> 16:15.239
SAY GOODBYE
TO HOLLYWOOD, LIV.

16:15.241 --> 16:17.642
MADDIE, STOP.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:17.644 --> 16:20.111
I'M DESTROYING
LIV'S AUDITION VIDEO.

16:20.113 --> 16:21.779
I DON'T WANT HER
TO LEAVE.

16:21.781 --> 16:23.581
HONEY, NO.

16:23.583 --> 16:25.850
NO, I KNOW THIS
IS GOING TO BE HARD,

16:25.852 --> 16:27.719
BUT THIS IS LIV'S DREAM.

16:27.721 --> 16:29.187
WE HAVE TO LET HER TRY.

16:29.189 --> 16:32.256
SHE WILL ALWAYS WONDER
WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED.

16:32.258 --> 16:33.825
YOU'RE RIGHT, MOM.

16:33.827 --> 16:36.027
I ONCE PASSED UP
A CHANCE

16:36.029 --> 16:37.895
TO MOVE TO INDIANAPOLIS

16:37.897 --> 16:40.565
TO FILL A COVETED SPOT
IN A REGIONAL PRODUCTION

16:40.567 --> 16:41.733
OF "OLIVER"

16:41.735 --> 16:44.669
AS STREET URCHIN #3.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.704
( with British accent )
I CARRY THAT REGRET WITH ME

16:46.706 --> 16:49.273
EVERY SINGLE DAY
OF ME LIFE.

16:52.544 --> 16:55.813
YOU ALMOST DESTROYED
MY AUDITION DVD?

16:55.815 --> 16:57.248
- LIV, I--
- NO, NO.

16:57.250 --> 16:59.017
HA!  IT'S COOL.

16:59.019 --> 17:01.986
WOW, FOR A WHILE THERE,
I THOUGHT I WAS THE EVIL TWIN.

17:01.988 --> 17:03.721
BUT IT TURNS OUT
WE'RE BOTH EVIL.

17:03.723 --> 17:06.057
SAMESIES!

17:06.059 --> 17:08.693
YOU CAN'T CALL SAMESIES.

17:08.695 --> 17:10.061
I WAS LIKE 10.

17:10.063 --> 17:11.829
OKAY.

17:11.831 --> 17:14.732
I THINK WE SHOULD FOCUS LESS
ON THE EVIL THAT YOU SHARE

17:14.734 --> 17:16.034
AND MORE ON THE LOVE.

17:16.036 --> 17:18.803
NEITHER ONE OF YOU WANTED
THE OTHER ONE TO LEAVE.

17:18.805 --> 17:21.572
( sighs )
MADDIE, SHE'S RIGHT.

17:21.574 --> 17:24.242
I MEAN, I MOVED BACK
TO WISCONSIN TO BE WITH YOU.

17:24.244 --> 17:25.977
I'M NOT READY
TO LET YOU GO.

17:27.546 --> 17:30.615
SO YEAH.
I HID YOUR LETTER.

17:30.617 --> 17:31.716
I'M SORRY.

17:33.552 --> 17:35.153
WELL, I MEAN--

17:35.155 --> 17:38.289
I GET IT.  YOUR HEART
WAS IN THE RIGHT PLACE.

17:38.291 --> 17:42.593
LIV, JUST KNOW THAT WHATEVER
IS IN THIS LETTER--

17:42.595 --> 17:44.295
WE'RE NEVER GOING
TO LOSE WHAT WE HAVE.

17:44.297 --> 17:45.696
THAT'S RIGHT.

17:45.698 --> 17:48.232
YOU'LL ALWAYS BE
SISTERS BY CHANCE,

17:48.234 --> 17:49.834
FRIENDS BY CHOICE.

17:49.836 --> 17:52.837
YEAH, SO LET'S NOT SAY THAT
OUT LOUD ANYMORE.

17:52.839 --> 17:55.640
( sighs )
OPEN YOUR LETTER.

17:55.642 --> 17:56.808
OPEN THE LETTER.

17:56.810 --> 17:58.576
Diggie:  <i>YEAH,</i>
<i>OPEN THE LETTER.</i>

17:58.578 --> 18:00.078
OKAY, FINE, I WILL--

18:00.080 --> 18:01.412
DIGGIE?

18:03.383 --> 18:06.584
JUST WALKING BY.
THOUGHT I'D SAY HELLO.

18:07.719 --> 18:10.988
OH. ( chuckles )
WEIRD. BUT SWEET.

18:10.990 --> 18:14.759
All: OPEN THE LETTER.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.260
( clears throat )

18:16.262 --> 18:18.129
I MADE TRYOUTS.

18:18.131 --> 18:19.597
I MADE TRYOUTS!

18:19.599 --> 18:22.633
( exclaiming )

18:22.635 --> 18:24.735
THIS IS HUGE.

18:24.737 --> 18:26.637
I AM SO PROUD OF YOU.

18:26.639 --> 18:29.273
WAIT, I HAVE
TO BE IN CHICAGO

18:29.275 --> 18:31.309
FOR TRYOUTS IN SIX HOURS?

18:32.244 --> 18:33.744
I'M NEVER GONNA MAKE THAT.

18:33.746 --> 18:34.946
SIX HOURS?

18:34.948 --> 18:36.781
OH!  SIX HOURS.

18:36.783 --> 18:38.616
WHAT HAVE I DONE?
OKAY.

18:38.618 --> 18:39.817
UM, NO NO NO.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:39.819 --> 18:42.787
I CAN HELP.  I CAN
HAVE YOU PACKED IN 5 1/2.

18:42.789 --> 18:44.622
WHOO!

18:44.624 --> 18:46.390
HUH.

18:46.392 --> 18:48.626
THIS SAYS TRYOUTS
ARE NEXT WEEKEND.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.661
( laughs, snorts )

18:50.663 --> 18:52.363
I KNOW.

18:52.365 --> 18:54.699
OH, BUT DID YOU
SEE HER JUMP?

18:55.901 --> 18:59.270
( laughs )
MAYBE I AM THE EVIL TWIN.

19:05.911 --> 19:07.111
( quiet chatter )

19:07.113 --> 19:09.313
AM I TOO LATE
FOR THE INSTA-JAM?

19:09.315 --> 19:11.215
I GOT A BATHROOM
HALL PASS FROM MY TEACHER,

19:11.217 --> 19:13.718
BUT I DIDN'T TELL HER
WHAT BATHROOM.

19:14.653 --> 19:17.188
GUYS, YOU MADE IT.

19:17.190 --> 19:19.223
BY THE TIME
SIXTH PERIOD STARTS,

19:19.225 --> 19:21.392
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SAY,
"JOEY ROONEY--

19:21.394 --> 19:23.294
I KNEW HIM WHEN."

19:23.296 --> 19:27.298
<i>( bell rings )</i>

19:27.300 --> 19:30.401
ATTENTION, RIDGEWOOD!

19:30.403 --> 19:34.138
GET READY
TO GET RHYTHM!

19:36.441 --> 19:38.976
1, 2, 3, 4.

19:41.146 --> 19:42.413
REALLY?

19:44.116 --> 19:47.018
SERIOUSLY, NOW IS NOT
THE TIME TO BE SHY.

19:48.787 --> 19:50.254
OH, MAN,
THIS IS TERRIBLE.

19:50.256 --> 19:51.289
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

19:51.291 --> 19:52.690
YOU'RE RIGHT.

19:52.692 --> 19:55.426
I HAVE AN IMMOBILIZING
DART GUN IN MY POCKET.

19:55.428 --> 19:57.128
WE CAN SAY
HE WAS DEHYDRATED.

19:59.298 --> 20:00.431
I THINK I HAVE
A BETTER IDEA.

20:04.970 --> 20:07.271
THANKS, MAN.

20:17.149 --> 20:18.749
NOW, ARE YOU GUYS DRUMMERS?

20:18.751 --> 20:21.352
OR ARE YOU BUMMERS?

20:23.222 --> 20:24.488
WELL, THE JOKE IS ON YOU.

20:24.490 --> 20:26.924
BECAUSE JOEY'S OUT THERE
WITH THE CAPTAIN

20:26.926 --> 20:28.226
OF THE BASKETBALL TEAM.

20:28.228 --> 20:30.261
AND YOU GUYS
ARE JUST STANDING HERE,

20:30.263 --> 20:32.863
GETTING LECTURED
BY A FIFTH GRADER.

20:37.035 --> 20:39.403
HEY, JOEY, WE GOT
THE BAND BACK TOGETHER.

20:39.405 --> 20:41.339
OH HO HO!

20:42.941 --> 20:44.875
ALL RIGHTY.

20:44.877 --> 20:46.911
1, 2, 3, 4.

20:50.382 --> 20:52.416
( inaudible
over drumming )

21:00.092 --> 21:02.827
( cheering )

21:05.097 --> 21:07.398
- WAY TO GO, JOEY!
- NOT NOW, DIGGIE.

21:07.400 --> 21:09.333
THEY LOVE ME.

21:13.805 --> 21:16.440
( gasps )
OH.

21:16.442 --> 21:18.976
SO HOW'D IT GO?

21:18.978 --> 21:20.077
DID YOU MAKE THE TEAM?

21:20.079 --> 21:22.079
WELL, THEY SAID

21:22.081 --> 21:23.514
SHE HAD
A LOT OF POTENTIAL.

21:23.516 --> 21:26.050
AND SHE WAS ONE OF ONLY
THREE SOPHOMORES

21:26.052 --> 21:27.385
INVITED TO TRY OUT.

21:27.387 --> 21:30.154
YEAH, THEY-- THEY SAID
I DID A REALLY GREAT JOB

21:30.156 --> 21:33.124
AND THEY SAID FOR ME
TO KEEP PRACTICING.

21:33.126 --> 21:36.360
- OH, MADDIE.
- I'M SO SORRY.

21:36.362 --> 21:39.196
YEAH, BECAUSE WE START
IN TEN WEEKS.

21:39.198 --> 21:40.464
I MADE THE TEAM!

21:40.466 --> 21:42.967
BAM!  WHAT?!

21:42.969 --> 21:44.368
DID YOU SEE THEIR FACES?

21:44.370 --> 21:47.371
I DIDN'T GIVE IT AWAY.
I DIDN'T GIVE IT AWAY!

21:48.340 --> 21:51.542
OH, MADDIE,
I AM SO PROUD OF YOU.

21:51.544 --> 21:54.945
THANKS, MOM.

21:54.947 --> 21:57.548
WOW, I'M REALLY GOING
TO MISS YOU, ROONEY.

21:57.550 --> 22:01.285
BUT I'LL BE HERE WAITING
FOR YOU WHEN YOU COME BACK.

22:01.287 --> 22:02.987
( chuckles )
THANKS, DIGGIE.

22:02.989 --> 22:05.022
( mockingly clears throat )
NO WAY.

22:05.024 --> 22:06.824
AHEM!

22:09.194 --> 22:11.362
SO, UM...

22:11.364 --> 22:13.831
I COULD BE GONE
FOR A REALLY LONG TIME.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.066
YOU JUST SAY THE WORD--

22:15.068 --> 22:16.500
DON'T GO!
FORGET YOUR DREAMS.

22:17.302 --> 22:19.870
WHAT?

22:19.872 --> 22:21.472
I'M TOTALLY KIDDING.
YOU HAVE TO GO.

22:21.474 --> 22:23.407
I ALREADY MADE PLANS
FOR YOUR HALF OF THE ROOM.

22:29.414 --> 22:31.615
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
MY AUDITION VIDEO.

22:31.617 --> 22:34.385
I WOULD LOVE TO BE
YOUR STEPHANIE EINSTEIN

22:34.387 --> 22:35.953
ON "SING IT LOUD."

22:35.955 --> 22:37.521
( laughing )

22:37.523 --> 22:39.390
THAT WAS GREAT, HONEY.

22:39.392 --> 22:41.425
NOW YOU GO ON
UP TO BED

22:41.427 --> 22:42.893
AND WE WILL MAIL THIS
OUT TOMORROW.

22:42.895 --> 22:44.061
THANKS, MOM.

22:44.063 --> 22:45.329
( chuckling )
OKAY.

22:45.331 --> 22:47.598
SLEEP WELL, HONEY.

22:47.600 --> 22:49.533
HELLO, HOLLYWOOD.

22:51.269 --> 22:53.504
HOPE YOU ENJOYED LIV.
SHE'S ADORABLE.

22:53.506 --> 22:55.072
BUT WHILE WE HAVE YOU HERE,

22:55.074 --> 22:57.141
I'D LOVE TO THROW
MY HAT IN THE RING

22:57.143 --> 23:00.311
FOR STEPHANIE'S MOM,
ALBERTA EINSTEIN.

23:00.313 --> 23:02.246
NOW, I DON'T HAVE
A SCRIPT,

23:02.248 --> 23:05.182
BUT HERE'S HOW I IMAGINE
THE CHARACTER WOULD BE.

23:06.651 --> 23:09.253
( sighs )

23:09.255 --> 23:11.355
( with British accent )
'ELLO.

23:11.357 --> 23:13.324
WELL, I DIDN'T
SEE YOU THERE.

23:13.326 --> 23:15.126
THE NAME'S EINSTEIN.

23:15.128 --> 23:17.628
( chuckles )
ALBERTA EINSTEIN.

23:17.630 --> 23:20.131
Pete:  <i>HEY, HONEY,</i>
<i>YOU WANT SOME POPCORN?</i>

23:20.133 --> 23:22.166
YEAH, SURE.
THAT'D BE GREAT.

23:23.935 --> 23:26.137
AGAIN, I HOPE YOU'LL
CONSIDER KAREN ROONEY

23:26.139 --> 23:27.438
FOR THE ROLE
OF ALBERTA EINSTEIN.

23:27.440 --> 23:28.606
THANKS.

23:28.608 --> 23:30.474
( with British accent )
CHEERS!
