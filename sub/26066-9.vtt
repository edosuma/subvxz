Purging any of you is my right.

her tormentor...

32:51.317 --> 32:54.450
which is her right.

the same privilege, Jane?

33:06.767 --> 33:09.030
It doesn't heal

It just makes the worst
of us worse

33:10.945 --> 33:12.903

just a little less than.

of The Purge tonight.

33:24.045 --> 33:26.221
No, Joe,
it was something else.

33:26.265 --> 33:30.269

for myself, for others,

33:35.100 --> 33:37.580
I earned my opportunities.

33:37.624 --> 33:40.757
Even when some people said
that I should use other...

33:40.801 --> 33:44.283
attributes to sweeten the deal,
I said no.

33:44.326 --> 33:47.503
Then I got into the real world
and I found out that being

33:47.547 --> 33:49.114
a professional woman,

33:49.157 --> 33:52.334
the real job
is to be a good sport,

33:52.378 --> 33:56.077

for half the opportunity,

33:56.121 --> 33:58.601

dangle advancement

33:58.645 --> 34:01.604

that the cost of success

34:01.648 --> 34:06.609
is enduring a few more harmless
jokes about my nice ass.

34:06.653 --> 34:09.264
But The Purge is
the equalizer, right?

34:09.308 --> 34:12.833
My chance to take
the brass ring at gunpoint.

34:12.876 --> 34:16.271
It can't be immoral...

34:16.315 --> 34:19.579

34:21.624 --> 34:25.802
I'll give you a confession.
I Purged.

34:26.890 --> 34:29.154

34:29.197 --> 34:30.981
Do you know what it
made me feel?

34:31.025 --> 34:32.809
Nothing but shame.

34:32.853 --> 34:36.030
I compromised who I am

34:36.074 --> 34:38.424
and what I've worked
a lifetime to be

34:38.467 --> 34:42.471
for a sexual predator.

34:42.515 --> 34:45.300
What a thing to live with.

34:45.344 --> 34:47.998

with it for very much longer.

34:48.042 --> 34:51.524
