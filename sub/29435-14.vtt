[woman speaking indistinctly

01:37.184 --> 01:39.708
Boss. Boss.
Hey. McGee.

01:39.751 --> 01:41.492
Give me a sitrep.I-I-I just got here.

01:41.536 --> 01:43.407
You don't know anything?No, I got the same text you did.

01:43.451 --> 01:44.539
It sounds bad.

01:44.582 --> 01:45.583
Come on.
There.

01:47.281 --> 01:48.630
Hey, hey. Are you okay?Hey.

01:48.673 --> 01:50.501
Uh, the vehicle was
a gray Lamborghini

01:50.545 --> 01:53.156
with black exhaust tips and a
rear carbon fiber spoiler wing.

01:53.200 --> 01:55.071
How's Torres?I canvassed the area
for cameras,

01:55.115 --> 01:56.986
but I didn't see any that had
a view of the accident.

01:57.029 --> 01:58.422
But what about, what about Nick?

01:58.466 --> 02:00.163
I was able to get a partial
plate, so between that

02:00.207 --> 02:01.512
and the vehicle type...Bishop!

02:01.556 --> 02:02.513
Bishop.

02:02.557 --> 02:03.949
What about Torres?

02:03.993 --> 02:06.169
Um...

02:06.213 --> 02:08.432
He shoved me out of the way.

02:08.476 --> 02:11.609
I knew he was strong,
but not, not that strong.

02:11.653 --> 02:13.220
And then he-he, like,

02:13.263 --> 02:18.399
ran to the car, uh, like some
kind of freaking action hero,

02:18.442 --> 02:20.966
like he was gonna-- I
don't know, I don't know,

02:21.010 --> 02:24.144
like, leap over it
as it passed by?

02:24.187 --> 02:26.189
[exhales]
And, um...

02:26.233 --> 02:29.540
He almost made it. Um...

02:31.847 --> 02:33.849
It's bad.

02:35.546 --> 02:38.854
Okay. Okay.

02:46.688 --> 02:48.168
[woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.]

02:56.393 --> 02:59.701
Excuse me.
I need to take his vitals.

03:01.703 --> 03:02.834
How is he?

03:02.878 --> 03:04.184
You family?

03:04.227 --> 03:06.621
Close enough.Well, if you're
not actually

03:06.664 --> 03:09.145
a blood relative, I'm afraid I'm
gonna have to ask you to leave.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.712
Special Agent Gibbs.

03:10.755 --> 03:13.018
NCIS.

03:13.062 --> 03:15.804
Right.

03:15.847 --> 03:17.458
I heard this was a hit-and-run.

03:17.501 --> 03:20.243
Well, your investigation
is gonna have to wait.

03:20.287 --> 03:22.245
As you can see,
our patient is in no condition

03:22.289 --> 03:23.638
to answer any questions.

03:23.681 --> 03:25.161
I don't care about
the investigation.

03:27.076 --> 03:29.034
So, family after all.

03:29.078 --> 03:30.601
How is he?

03:30.645 --> 03:34.997
I mean, no broken bones,
minimal abrasions.

03:35.040 --> 03:36.999
Uh, but apparently
he hit his head

03:37.042 --> 03:38.479
and hasn't regained
consciousness.

03:38.522 --> 03:39.567
You know, the doctor
really needs

03:39.610 --> 03:41.090
to be the one
to fill you in,

03:41.133 --> 03:43.092
but we have him listed
in critical condition

03:43.135 --> 03:46.138
with an unspecified
cardiac anomaly.

03:59.413 --> 04:02.242
You hang in there, amigo.

04:07.377 --> 04:08.770
NURSE:
Hey, don't worry.

04:08.813 --> 04:10.685
He's in good hands.

04:11.860 --> 04:13.470
We got the best neurosurgeon
on the East Coast

04:13.514 --> 04:15.559
being choppered in from
Baltimore as we speak.

04:15.603 --> 04:18.258
And I hear
she's a miracle worker.

04:18.301 --> 04:20.956
[monitor beeping rapidly]

04:24.307 --> 04:26.701
What's happening?Uh, I don't know.
I think he's crashing.

04:32.489 --> 04:34.839
Call a code!
Call a code!

04:34.883 --> 04:36.493
Out. Now.

04:36.537 --> 04:39.148
Uh, stop the antibiotic,
infuse normal saline.

04:39.191 --> 04:41.019
I got chest.Keep fighting, Nick.

04:41.063 --> 04:42.325
Where's the damn
attending?!

04:42.369 --> 04:43.413
You fight, Torres!

04:43.457 --> 04:44.936
Doctor, patient
heart rate is 72.

04:44.980 --> 04:48.113
Torres, you fight!
You keep fighting! You hear me?

04:48.157 --> 04:49.463
You hear me?!

04:49.506 --> 04:52.074
[overlapping chatter]

05:01.083 --> 05:03.868
[elevator bell dings]

05:03.912 --> 05:05.392
GIBBS:
Eat.

05:05.435 --> 05:08.438
Uh... No, uh-- I'm not hungry.

05:08.482 --> 05:11.267
I didn't ask you
if you were hungry.

05:14.488 --> 05:16.316
Eat.

05:22.017 --> 05:23.453
Hey.

05:23.497 --> 05:24.846
Hey. He out of surgery yet?

05:24.889 --> 05:26.369
No. Not yet.

05:26.413 --> 05:28.023
Any word on the driver?

05:28.066 --> 05:30.242
Well, we got a ton
of witnesses, but, uh,

05:30.286 --> 05:33.637
Bishop has more info than
all of them put together.

05:33.681 --> 05:36.336
You know, apparently this guy
has been using that area

05:36.379 --> 05:39.339
as his own personal drag strip
for the last week or so.

05:39.382 --> 05:41.341
We got to find the guy
before he kills somebody.

05:41.384 --> 05:44.039
Well, unfortunately, there's
more than 50 Lamborghinis

05:44.082 --> 05:45.997
registered in a
100-mile radius.

05:46.041 --> 05:48.478
And most of them are gray,
believe it or not.BISHOP: Excuse me.

05:48.522 --> 05:50.567
Is there any more news?So we don't have more to go on.

05:50.611 --> 05:53.004
Well, somebody must
know something.We'll let you know

05:53.048 --> 05:54.354
as soon as we know.[Bishop sighs]

05:54.397 --> 05:56.399
Please have a seat.

05:56.443 --> 05:59.402
Okay. Thank you.

06:00.447 --> 06:03.188
Boss, she should go home.

06:03.232 --> 06:05.190
Hey. I already tried.

06:05.234 --> 06:07.236
Want to give it
a shot? Go ahead.

06:07.279 --> 06:09.107
Well, maybe we should
call in Sloane?

06:10.282 --> 06:11.458
Agent Gibbs?

06:11.501 --> 06:13.373
Dr. Romero.

06:13.416 --> 06:15.026
Hi.Please tell us you
got good news.

06:15.070 --> 06:16.550
Actually, I do.

06:16.593 --> 06:19.335
We tracked Agent Torres's
cardiac dysfunction

06:19.379 --> 06:21.816
to a small puncture wound
in his cervical spine.

06:21.859 --> 06:23.252
From what?

06:23.295 --> 06:25.907
It appeared to be
a sliver of carbon fiber

06:25.950 --> 06:27.430
from the vehicle that hit him.

06:27.474 --> 06:30.172
The surgery to remove it
was actually quite minor.

06:30.215 --> 06:31.652
So he's gonna be okay?

06:31.695 --> 06:34.263
He's out of immediate danger,
but the prognosis

06:34.306 --> 06:37.745
in these situations
is difficult to predict.

06:37.788 --> 06:38.876
Give it a try.

06:38.920 --> 06:41.096
For now, Agent Torres

06:41.139 --> 06:44.142
is in a medically induced coma
to keep the swelling down.

06:44.186 --> 06:46.318
All we can do
at this point

06:46.362 --> 06:47.494
is hope.

06:47.537 --> 06:49.191
We can do better than that.

06:49.234 --> 06:51.149
Carbon fiber.

06:51.193 --> 06:52.542
Excuse me?

06:52.586 --> 06:55.371
The sliver? I want it.

06:59.244 --> 07:01.595
McGEE:
Hey.

07:01.638 --> 07:03.727
So, this was inside
Torres's skull, huh?

07:03.771 --> 07:05.990
Imagine the stories
it could tell.

07:06.034 --> 07:08.079
Actually, it was in his neck.

07:08.123 --> 07:10.473
The doctor says
it splintered off the car

07:10.517 --> 07:12.214
when Torres landed on it.

07:12.257 --> 07:15.043
He's, um, gonna
be okay, right?

07:15.086 --> 07:18.089
Any heads at the hospital need
busting? 'Cause I know a guy.

07:18.133 --> 07:19.917
I think Bishop's
got it covered.

07:19.961 --> 07:22.964
The entire nursing staff
has a code word they use

07:23.007 --> 07:24.444
when they see her coming.

07:25.009 --> 07:27.708
Forrest. As in "run."

07:27.751 --> 07:29.884
She's really taking it hard.
I mean, we all are.

07:29.927 --> 07:33.714
But she's, you know, maybe
taking it a little differently?

07:33.757 --> 07:35.933
I don't know what
you're talking about.

07:35.977 --> 07:37.282
Oh, come on.

07:37.326 --> 07:39.241
Look, Kasie, Bishop

07:39.284 --> 07:40.808
is like a sister to me, okay?

07:40.851 --> 07:42.287
And Torres is like a brother.

07:43.680 --> 07:44.768
You see where
I'm going with this?

07:44.812 --> 07:46.553
Yes. We are all going
to need therapy

07:46.596 --> 07:48.990
if those two ever hook up.
Okay, moving on.

07:49.033 --> 07:50.905
I think the best thing to do
for the both of them

07:50.948 --> 07:53.298
is for us to find
the driver of that car.

07:53.342 --> 07:54.778
Besides, Bishop needs
the distraction.

07:54.822 --> 07:57.172
And we'll never hear the end
of it if Torres wakes up

07:57.215 --> 07:58.956
before that guy
is behind bars.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.436
Yeah. So talk to me.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.785
Well, so I started with a list

08:01.829 --> 08:04.614
of all the gray Lambos
registered in the area.

08:04.658 --> 08:06.442
50 and some change.
Unfortunately,

08:06.486 --> 08:10.141
Bishop's partial plate only
narrowed the list down to 30.

08:10.185 --> 08:12.753
Isn't this the part
where you say "however"?

08:12.796 --> 08:15.538
Ooh. It feels good to be known.

08:15.582 --> 08:17.540
However, the doc was right.

08:17.584 --> 08:19.803
I was able to trace
the carbon fiber sliver

08:19.847 --> 08:21.849
to a specific
aftermarket spoiler.

08:21.892 --> 08:23.503
If you cross-reference
the spoiler buyer list

08:23.546 --> 08:27.594
with the remaining vehicles,
you get a winner.

08:28.856 --> 08:31.336
Xavier Zolotov.

08:31.380 --> 08:32.816
I hate him already.

08:32.860 --> 08:34.557
KASIE:
Oh, you and everybody else.

08:34.601 --> 08:36.733
Apparently, he's a spoiled brat
trust fund baby

08:36.777 --> 08:40.258
famous for being, well,
a spoiled brat trust fund baby.

08:40.302 --> 08:41.477
Take a look.

08:41.521 --> 08:43.087
KASIE:
Ooh.

08:43.131 --> 08:45.916
Nice gold-plated
AK-47, brah.

08:45.960 --> 08:48.266
You know, they say money
doesn't buy happiness, but...

08:48.310 --> 08:51.269
looked pretty stoked eating
caviar on his private jet.

08:51.313 --> 08:54.229
Barefoot, I might add.You got an address?

08:54.272 --> 08:55.839
I do, but first
you have to do me two favors.

08:55.883 --> 08:57.058
What?
One,

08:57.101 --> 08:58.320
watch your back.

08:58.363 --> 09:00.191
Apparently, this guy
travels with his own

09:00.235 --> 09:02.193
private security force.

09:02.237 --> 09:04.021
And number two?

09:04.065 --> 09:07.242
Show Gibbs these photos before
he goes to arrest this tool.

09:07.285 --> 09:08.548
[McGee chuckles]

09:08.591 --> 09:11.246
Yeah. Definitely.

09:14.292 --> 09:16.294
[elevator bell dings]

09:27.218 --> 09:29.090
What's going on?Back inside.

09:29.133 --> 09:30.700
What?

09:30.744 --> 09:32.833
Promised you'd behave yourself.Yeah, that was before I knew

09:32.876 --> 09:35.662
our suspect's wife kept
a baby tiger as a pet.

09:35.705 --> 09:37.533
Think about armed bodyguards.I know.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.491
This guy's not gonna go
down without a fight.

09:40.492 --> 09:42.103
NCIS! Open the door!

09:42.146 --> 09:44.453
We have a warrant
for the arrest...

09:44.496 --> 09:46.586
of Xavier Zolotov.

09:46.629 --> 09:50.198
LAYLA:
Don't mind him,
he's just hungover.

09:50.241 --> 09:51.721
[Russian pop music playing]

09:57.945 --> 09:59.947
[Layla speaking Russian]

10:04.168 --> 10:05.561
[laughs]

10:05.605 --> 10:08.216
So, what did Xavier do now?

10:08.259 --> 10:09.565
Where is he?

10:09.609 --> 10:11.132
More to the point,
who am I writing a check to

10:11.175 --> 10:12.742
this time?
[laughs]

10:12.786 --> 10:14.178
[laughter]

10:16.006 --> 10:18.226
Hey. Bishop.

10:18.269 --> 10:21.142
XAVIER:
What are you crying for, huh?

10:21.185 --> 10:22.796
That's literally
the worst massage

10:22.839 --> 10:24.624
I've ever had in my life!

10:24.667 --> 10:25.625
[speaks Russian]

10:25.668 --> 10:27.365
[laughter]

10:31.500 --> 10:33.458
What has my wife done now?

10:35.939 --> 10:37.245
More to the point...

10:37.288 --> 10:39.813
[laughter]

10:39.856 --> 10:42.163
Who am I writing
a check to, huh?

10:42.206 --> 10:43.294
[giggling]

10:50.562 --> 10:53.348
Interesting man.

10:53.391 --> 10:56.177
His social media profile
alone is enough to warrant

10:56.220 --> 10:58.483
a diagnosis of histrionic
and narcissistic

10:58.527 --> 10:59.789
personality disorder.

10:59.833 --> 11:01.312
They all look
that way to me.

11:01.356 --> 11:03.314
Yeah, but he takes it
to a whole new level.

11:03.358 --> 11:05.708
He's wildly irresponsible.Yeah, I noticed.

11:05.752 --> 11:06.840
To the point where

11:06.883 --> 11:09.059
people around him get hurt.You think?

11:09.103 --> 11:11.627
Okay, he's listed
in multiple police reports.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.542
Last year
a 15-year-old girl

11:13.585 --> 11:16.545
died after she was drugged
at a party of his.

11:16.588 --> 11:18.199
And just last month
he was accused of

11:18.242 --> 11:20.027
shooting a bouncer on his way
out of a nightclub.

11:20.070 --> 11:22.377
Left the guy
partially paralyzed.

11:22.420 --> 11:24.248
Somehow he always
gets away with it.

11:28.426 --> 11:30.951
Not this time.

11:30.994 --> 11:33.867
Uh, are you sure that Bishop
should be handling

11:33.910 --> 11:35.303
the interrogation?

11:35.346 --> 11:36.478
I've noticed she
seems a little...

11:36.521 --> 11:38.045
Seems a little what, Jack?

11:38.088 --> 11:40.395
Never mind.

11:40.438 --> 11:42.832
I have a feeling that's exactly
why you picked her.

11:45.095 --> 11:47.141
Is this your vehicle?

11:47.184 --> 11:51.754
Look, I think you and I
got off on the wrong foot.

11:51.798 --> 11:53.756
I was just messing around.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.497
Were you just
messing around

11:55.540 --> 11:57.760
when you were driving
90 miles per hour

11:57.804 --> 11:59.457
down a residential street?

11:59.501 --> 12:02.025
That was a mistake.

12:03.374 --> 12:06.160
One that I'm truly sorry for.

12:08.162 --> 12:11.382
If I had known
how hard it would be

12:11.426 --> 12:13.515
to find someone in the area

12:13.558 --> 12:16.083
that did good body work
on exotic cars,

12:16.126 --> 12:17.954
I would have been
much more careful.

12:17.998 --> 12:19.695
[laughs]

12:19.739 --> 12:20.957
Oh, boy.

12:21.001 --> 12:22.872
BISHOP:
You trying to piss me off?

12:22.916 --> 12:24.569
Is that how you get your kicks?

12:24.613 --> 12:28.399
No. If I was trying to get
my kicks off with you,

12:28.443 --> 12:30.662
I would be much more creative.

12:30.706 --> 12:32.490
Well, you'd have to be,

12:32.534 --> 12:34.666
after what I saw
under that towel.

12:34.710 --> 12:37.974
Are you aware that fleeing
the scene of an accident

12:38.018 --> 12:39.019
is a crime?

12:39.062 --> 12:40.977
I'm sorry for that, too.

12:41.021 --> 12:44.502
You know, to be honest with you,
I was so drunk...

12:44.546 --> 12:45.634
[makes popping sound]

12:45.677 --> 12:48.419
I don't even know
what way was up.

12:50.204 --> 12:53.076
Yeah?
You want to write it down?

12:54.904 --> 12:56.427
What is he doing?

12:56.471 --> 12:58.734
Burying himself.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.171
Okay, I think we're
done here, yeah?

13:01.215 --> 13:03.695
How about you go
and call my lawyer

13:03.739 --> 13:05.567
so I can get out of here, huh?

13:05.610 --> 13:07.003
You're not going anywhere.

13:07.047 --> 13:10.311
You just admitted
to multiple felonies.

13:10.354 --> 13:12.139
A lawyer can't help you now.

13:12.182 --> 13:14.010
I don't need help.

13:14.054 --> 13:17.274
What I need is a ride home.

13:17.318 --> 13:19.015
Because I have flight,

13:19.059 --> 13:21.539
and I need to pack for it.

13:23.759 --> 13:25.717
[laughs]

13:27.545 --> 13:28.851
McGEE:
A flight?

13:28.895 --> 13:30.853
Wait, so he confessed
to being the driver?

13:30.897 --> 13:32.986
Yep.
And fleeing the scene
of an accident.

13:33.029 --> 13:33.987
Yep.I don't get it.

13:34.030 --> 13:35.553
He must be covering for someone.

13:35.597 --> 13:36.859
Kasie checked the car.
His fingerprints are

13:36.903 --> 13:38.121
all over the steering wheel,

13:38.165 --> 13:40.167
and his boot prints are
all over the pedals.

13:40.210 --> 13:41.516
He was driving.

13:41.559 --> 13:42.691
Then, how does this guy think
he's going anywhere

13:42.734 --> 13:44.301
other than a jail cell?

13:44.345 --> 13:45.520
Because we're letting him go.

13:46.564 --> 13:47.522
Excuse me?

13:47.565 --> 13:50.525
[Xavier exclaims
in Russian]

13:51.526 --> 13:53.528
[laughs]

13:53.571 --> 13:54.659
No.

13:54.703 --> 13:55.922
XAVIER:
Uh-oh.

13:57.619 --> 14:00.361
Agent Bishop, stand down.

14:00.404 --> 14:02.058
No, there's no way
you made bail,

14:02.102 --> 14:03.581
not this quickly

14:03.625 --> 14:05.235
and not with fleeing the scene.
You're going to jail.

14:05.279 --> 14:08.151
Agent Bishop, I said stand down.

14:08.935 --> 14:10.806
If you don't listen
to your boss,

14:10.850 --> 14:13.200
I'm going to file
assault charges.

14:13.243 --> 14:15.767
And it will be you
who goes to jail.

14:15.811 --> 14:18.161
[elevator bell dings]

14:18.205 --> 14:19.641
[laughs]

14:24.689 --> 14:26.648
[elevator bell dings]

14:26.691 --> 14:28.302
[laughs]

14:31.914 --> 14:34.438
Director, what is going on?

14:42.446 --> 14:44.884
The Russians are
claiming immunity.

14:44.927 --> 14:45.972
That guy ain't no diplomat.

14:46.015 --> 14:47.930
I didn't say
diplomatic immunity.

14:47.974 --> 14:49.671
It's something called
sovereign immunity.

14:49.714 --> 14:50.846
That's for royal families.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.066
Yeah, well,
apparently Xavier has

14:53.109 --> 14:55.764
some old-school
royal blood in him.

14:55.807 --> 14:58.071
Russia doesn't even have
a monarchy anymore. That's bull.

14:58.114 --> 14:59.681
I couldn't agree more,
Agent Bishop,

14:59.724 --> 15:02.292
but apparently the family has
some friends in high places.

15:02.336 --> 15:05.339
State Department doesn't want
to contest the immunity claim.

15:05.382 --> 15:07.950
God forbid we upset
the Russians.

15:07.994 --> 15:10.170
So that's it, he just walks?

15:10.213 --> 15:11.954
Flies, actually.

15:11.998 --> 15:14.261
I'm told he's gonna be leaving
the country tomorrow.

15:14.304 --> 15:16.263
Leon...No, Torres is lying
in a hospital bed

15:16.306 --> 15:17.481
and may never get out.

15:17.525 --> 15:19.440
I'm very aware of
Agent Torres's condition.

15:19.483 --> 15:23.313
Okay, what if that was your kid
lying in the ICU, Director?

15:26.012 --> 15:27.448
Give us a minute.

15:35.325 --> 15:37.066
You need to get control
of your agent.

15:37.110 --> 15:38.459
I think you need to
answer her question.

15:38.502 --> 15:39.982
I don't appreciate
the insinuation

15:40.026 --> 15:41.810
that I don't look out
for my people.

15:41.853 --> 15:42.898
That what you're doing here?

15:42.942 --> 15:44.552
So what if Agent Torres
isn't my kid?

15:44.595 --> 15:45.814
Hell, he's not yours either.

15:45.857 --> 15:48.599
These are the only kids
I have left!

15:49.774 --> 15:51.124
Come on, Leon.

15:51.167 --> 15:53.430
Have you read Interpol's
report on that guy?

15:53.474 --> 15:54.997
Of course I did.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.827
Agent Torres is hardly
his first victim.

15:58.870 --> 16:01.830
He's left broken bodies
or worse on five continents.

16:01.873 --> 16:05.312
And Torres won't be his
last. I'm surprised.

16:05.355 --> 16:07.923
Not like you to roll over.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.317
Who said I rolled over?

16:10.360 --> 16:12.014
You and Bishop just wouldn't
give me a chance

16:12.058 --> 16:14.147
to get a word in edgewise.

16:14.190 --> 16:16.323
Gibbs, I told my superiors
that they don't get to decide

16:16.366 --> 16:18.673
who NCIS investigates.

16:18.716 --> 16:21.763
The director of NCIS does,
and last I checked, that's me.

16:21.806 --> 16:23.243
So if they don't like
my choices,

16:23.286 --> 16:25.245
they can ask me to resign.And?

16:25.288 --> 16:28.204
They asked me to resign. Here.

16:30.076 --> 16:32.034
I was halfway through
a rather spirited

16:32.078 --> 16:34.167
letter of resignation
when I realized something.

16:34.210 --> 16:35.864
What?

16:35.907 --> 16:38.606
I have friends
in high places, too.

16:38.649 --> 16:40.912
I just need you to
buy me some time.

16:46.831 --> 16:49.704
I cannot believe that Vance was
ordered to let this guy walk.

16:49.747 --> 16:51.053
And for the Russians?

16:51.097 --> 16:52.881
Yeah, well, State wants
the story to go away

16:52.924 --> 16:54.187
as quietly as possible.

16:54.230 --> 16:56.276
I have a feeling
we're gonna make some noise.

16:56.319 --> 16:58.713
Not us. Vance.Is he gonna push back?

16:58.756 --> 16:59.888
He'd better do it quickly.

16:59.931 --> 17:01.542
Xavier leaves the
country tomorrow.

17:01.585 --> 17:02.804
Yeah, once he's out
of our jurisdiction,

17:02.847 --> 17:04.066
we've lost him for good.

17:04.110 --> 17:05.111
That's why we need
to keep him here.

17:05.154 --> 17:06.721
Buy Vance some time.

17:06.764 --> 17:09.898
Okay, well, how are we supposed
to keep Xavier here

17:09.941 --> 17:11.726
when we aren't even allowed
to detain him?

17:11.769 --> 17:14.772
Find a way to trick him
into staying here on his own.

17:15.817 --> 17:17.775
Huh.

17:17.819 --> 17:19.081
All right, well,
what do you get the guy

17:19.125 --> 17:21.083
that's got everything?

17:21.127 --> 17:23.781
Maybe we get the Kardashians
to invite him over for dinner.

17:23.825 --> 17:25.174
Who?

17:25.218 --> 17:28.090
Look, let's dig deeper into
Xavier's Instagram feed.

17:28.134 --> 17:29.309
There's got to be
something there.

17:29.352 --> 17:31.485
Yeah, go. Do it.[phone rings]

17:31.528 --> 17:33.400
Yeah, it's Gibbs.

17:34.662 --> 17:36.403
Uh-huh. When?

17:36.446 --> 17:40.450
Oh, wow. It's been staring
at us right in the face.

17:41.495 --> 17:42.670
How bad?

17:44.454 --> 17:46.152
Right.

17:47.109 --> 17:48.110
All right.

17:48.154 --> 17:50.547
Thank you.

17:50.591 --> 17:52.375
Is it Nick?

17:52.419 --> 17:54.247
Uh, yeah.

17:54.290 --> 17:56.336
Doctor said Torres
is going back into surgery.

17:59.861 --> 18:00.905
Bishop, go.

18:01.950 --> 18:03.647
Go, he should have
someone with him.

18:03.691 --> 18:05.562
Yeah, we can handle things here.

18:05.606 --> 18:06.911
Besides, uh,
I think

18:06.955 --> 18:08.522
I may have a lead
to go on, so...

18:17.879 --> 18:19.489
You think he's
gonna be all right?

18:19.533 --> 18:22.144
Yeah, he's a fighter.

18:22.188 --> 18:23.450
So is Bishop.

18:25.887 --> 18:27.802
Yeah.

18:27.845 --> 18:30.021
The lead-- what do we got?

18:30.065 --> 18:31.762
Well, nothing
on Xavier,

18:31.806 --> 18:35.157
but I think this is exactly
what we're looking for.

18:40.162 --> 18:43.513
NCIS.

18:43.557 --> 18:44.819
Seriously?

18:44.862 --> 18:47.648
Don't you people have,
like, day jobs?

18:47.691 --> 18:51.042
Really? It's 11:00 a.m., you're
carrying a yoga mat and a latte.

18:52.653 --> 18:55.699
NCIS! Open up!

18:55.743 --> 18:56.700
Step aside.

18:56.744 --> 18:57.658
We've got a warrant.

18:57.701 --> 19:00.051

19:01.227 --> 19:02.837
Got a license
for that?

but you knew that.

isn't here.

Remember, fold
the sleeves first.

last game before we left.

19:23.858 --> 19:25.425
You're not going anywhere.Oh?

19:25.468 --> 19:28.776
I think we are. Your government
has been very accommodating.

19:28.819 --> 19:30.256
Yeah, to Xavier, sure.

19:30.299 --> 19:31.779
Yeah, he's more than free to go.

19:31.822 --> 19:33.041
Sovereign immunity and all.

19:33.084 --> 19:34.825
Unfortunately,
that does not apply to you.

19:34.869 --> 19:37.393
You're not going anywhere.

19:37.437 --> 19:39.134
No, you don't need
a license for a handgun

of Virginia.

one for a tiger.

had nothing
to do with that.

Okay.

20:23.918 --> 20:26.268
So, you guys here for a reason?

20:26.312 --> 20:28.052
Or, uh, did you come here
to play referee? Hmm?

20:28.096 --> 20:29.271

We're here to tell you

20:29.315 --> 20:31.360
your flight home
has been delayed.

20:31.404 --> 20:34.058
We're flying private.Then you're
flying alone.

20:34.102 --> 20:36.539
We just arrested your wife.

20:40.630 --> 20:41.849
What for?

20:41.892 --> 20:43.372
Possession of an exotic animal.

20:43.416 --> 20:45.940
Violation of the Endangered
Species Act.

20:45.983 --> 20:49.030
Not to mention
a few animal cruelty statutes.

20:49.073 --> 20:51.467
You have got to be kidding me.GIBBS:
No.

20:51.511 --> 20:53.556
No. She's looking
at seven years.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.210
McGEE:
And since she's
an obvious flight risk,

20:55.254 --> 20:57.952
you can all but guarantee
the judge is gonna

20:57.995 --> 20:59.910
deny her bail.

21:04.524 --> 21:06.308
That is a real problem...

21:07.396 --> 21:09.355
...for her.

21:09.398 --> 21:11.139
Okay, is that all
you guys need?

21:11.182 --> 21:13.576
Because I'm going to try
to squeeze in another game.

21:13.620 --> 21:15.622
And then I'm going
to do the clubbing.Xavier!

21:15.665 --> 21:18.973
And then I'm going to tell
my pilots to fire up the PJ.

Come on!

21:33.292 --> 21:34.728
How is he?

21:34.771 --> 21:37.470
Your friend has
fluid on his lungs.

21:37.513 --> 21:39.994
And as a result, his breathing
is severely strained.

21:40.037 --> 21:41.735
But you can fix it?

21:41.778 --> 21:43.432
We can drain the fluid, yes.

21:43.476 --> 21:45.391
But if this happens again,

we're gonna
have a problem.

of problem?

21:50.178 --> 21:53.703
only cross that bridge
if we have to, Agent Bishop.

21:57.403 --> 21:59.361
McGEE:
That didn't sound so good.

21:59.405 --> 22:01.015
Please tell me
Xavier cried

22:01.058 --> 22:02.495
when you told him
you arrested his wife.

22:02.538 --> 22:04.801
Actually, not even close.

22:04.845 --> 22:07.238
The guy almost seemed
happy about it.

22:07.282 --> 22:09.023
He's still leaving?Yeah.

22:09.066 --> 22:10.677
Do you think he's bluffing?No.

22:10.720 --> 22:12.200
Neither does Gibbs.

22:12.243 --> 22:13.897
I mean, we've been
racking our brains,

22:13.941 --> 22:16.073
but we're pretty much
out of options at this point.

22:16.117 --> 22:18.206
I hate to say
it, but...

22:18.249 --> 22:20.121
I think this guy's
gonna get away.

22:36.137 --> 22:38.879
All right, I'm gonna call
Gibbs, update him on our boy.

22:38.922 --> 22:41.360
Yeah, you do that.

22:42.926 --> 22:44.537
You going back to the office?

22:44.580 --> 22:45.712
Nope.

22:45.755 --> 22:47.409
Well, where are
you going?

22:47.453 --> 22:49.585
I'm going to find Xavier.

22:49.629 --> 22:51.326
Bishop, we've already
been through this.

22:51.370 --> 22:52.545
We can't arrest him.

22:52.588 --> 22:54.503
I don't plan on arresting him.

22:54.547 --> 22:55.896
Well, then what's the plan?

22:57.071 --> 22:59.421
I'm gonna kill him.

23:00.553 --> 23:02.555
[scoffs]

23:15.524 --> 23:17.744
Hey, you can't be serious.

23:17.787 --> 23:19.310
Oh, yeah, why's that?

23:19.354 --> 23:20.399
Because assassinating
the bad guy

23:20.442 --> 23:21.487
is sort of a no-no.

23:21.530 --> 23:22.705
So is letting him walk away

23:22.749 --> 23:24.228
and live his life
happily ever after.

23:24.272 --> 23:26.361
Bishop, you were in
a car accident, okay?

23:26.405 --> 23:28.232
You're not thinking straight.

23:28.276 --> 23:29.756
Now, listen, I want
to get this guy

23:29.799 --> 23:31.322
as much as you do.Then move.

23:31.366 --> 23:32.498
But I don't want
to spend the next 40 years

23:32.541 --> 23:33.890
of my life in Leavenworth.

23:33.934 --> 23:35.109
Why are you assuming
I would get caught?

23:35.152 --> 23:36.980
Why are we even having
this conversation?

23:37.024 --> 23:40.070
Look... I just can't let Xavier
leave this country, Tim.

23:40.114 --> 23:42.203
I just can't.

23:42.246 --> 23:43.639
I understand that.
We will find a way

23:43.683 --> 23:45.554
to keep him here.
Vance just needs...

23:45.598 --> 23:47.469
No, we are all out of options.

23:47.513 --> 23:49.428
You just said it yourself
two minutes ago.That was before

23:49.471 --> 23:51.255
you flipped out and said
you were gonna kill a guy.

23:51.299 --> 23:53.214
Could you say it
a little louder?

23:55.216 --> 23:57.436
You think Torres would be happy
with you doing this?

23:57.479 --> 24:00.787
I don't think Torres
gets a vote.

24:00.830 --> 24:01.875
Well, what about
when he wakes up?

24:01.918 --> 24:04.268
You mean ifhe wakes up?

24:04.312 --> 24:06.749
[sighs]

24:06.793 --> 24:08.795
Okay, Xavier's jet
isn't scheduled

24:08.838 --> 24:10.623
to leave
until tomorrow.

24:10.666 --> 24:13.495
Now, that gives us some time
to figure out how to stall him

24:13.539 --> 24:16.324
before you commit
premeditated murder.

24:16.367 --> 24:18.587
Now, Ellie, you
need a break.

24:18.631 --> 24:21.503
Go home. I will call Sloane,
and we'll get started on Xavier.

24:21.547 --> 24:23.026
I-I'm not going home.

24:23.070 --> 24:25.507
Bishop!I... am going to the office.

24:25.551 --> 24:27.466
Okay? If there's something
we haven't thought of,

24:27.509 --> 24:28.684
I will find it there.

24:30.033 --> 24:31.339
Need a ride?

24:31.382 --> 24:32.862
No, I can manage.

24:32.906 --> 24:35.169
Just... need you to stay here

24:35.212 --> 24:37.301
until Torres
gets out of surgery.

24:37.345 --> 24:39.390
Call me the second
he does, okay?

24:39.434 --> 24:41.218
Okay.

24:45.571 --> 24:47.834
[door opens]

24:47.877 --> 24:49.662
[door closes]

24:50.924 --> 24:53.840
Oh!

24:53.883 --> 24:55.885
Not bad.

24:55.929 --> 24:57.321
Thanks.

24:57.365 --> 25:00.324
Helps to clear my mind.

25:00.368 --> 25:02.152
Kind of like my version
of building a boat,

25:02.196 --> 25:03.545
but not in a basement.

25:03.589 --> 25:06.592
I heard you got
something on Xavier.

25:06.635 --> 25:08.898
What's the word on Torres?

25:08.942 --> 25:11.335
Surgery went well.

25:11.379 --> 25:14.382
Doctors say he's stable,
still not awake.

25:14.425 --> 25:15.775
And Bishop?

25:15.818 --> 25:16.906
What about her?

25:16.950 --> 25:18.517
Well, McGee called me
last night.

25:18.560 --> 25:19.779
He didn't go into detail,

25:19.822 --> 25:21.694
but something she said
had him rattled.

25:21.737 --> 25:23.391
He called you?

25:23.434 --> 25:25.741
Uh, yeah.

25:25.785 --> 25:28.701
He was concerned about
his friend's mental well-being,

25:28.744 --> 25:31.225
so he called a psychologist--
is that a problem?

25:31.268 --> 25:32.835
No.

25:32.879 --> 25:34.010
He didn't tell me anything

25:34.054 --> 25:35.534
I hadn't already suspected.

25:35.577 --> 25:36.709
Mm-hmm.
Listen,
traumatic events

25:36.752 --> 25:38.275
can often trigger

25:38.319 --> 25:40.495
periods of mental
instability.

25:40.539 --> 25:43.454
It sounds like Bishop is
suffering from some form

25:43.498 --> 25:46.675
of PTSD, and from
the little McGee told me,

25:46.719 --> 25:48.547
it sounds like
she's having trouble

25:48.590 --> 25:51.462
regulating
her emotional responses.

25:51.506 --> 25:52.681
Yeah, well,
she'll pull out of it.

25:52.725 --> 25:53.769
She always does.

25:53.813 --> 25:55.162
I don't think so.

25:55.205 --> 25:56.946
I think it's different
this time.

25:56.990 --> 26:00.254
Maybe you should consider
taking her off duty for a while.

26:00.297 --> 26:04.519
Well, maybe, Jack, you should
let me handle my own team.

26:04.563 --> 26:06.434
You know what?

26:06.477 --> 26:08.088
Bishop is
spiraling.

26:08.131 --> 26:09.829
And you're not far behind.

26:09.872 --> 26:10.917
Me?!

26:10.960 --> 26:12.396
Yeah, you.

26:12.440 --> 26:13.833
Sure, you've had
your share of tragedy,

26:13.876 --> 26:16.444
and it's given you
some really thick skin.

26:16.487 --> 26:18.098
But what always
gets you through the day

26:18.141 --> 26:20.404
is that someone always pays.

26:20.448 --> 26:22.624
But now the bad guy's
gonna get away.

26:22.668 --> 26:24.887
And that must be
unbearable for you...

26:24.931 --> 26:26.454
You got something
on Xavier or not?

26:26.497 --> 26:28.282
[stammers]
Really?

26:29.500 --> 26:31.198
Yes.

26:31.241 --> 26:34.549
I have had
the displeasure of digging

26:34.593 --> 26:36.638
through all of his
social media accounts.

26:36.682 --> 26:40.033
This guy is
your typical chauvinistic

26:40.076 --> 26:42.252
jackass.Tell me something I don't know.

26:42.296 --> 26:44.298
Okay.

26:44.341 --> 26:46.866
I'll tell you how you can stop
him from leaving the country.

26:46.909 --> 26:48.171
How about that?

26:49.520 --> 26:52.306
A man like that has
an excessive need

26:52.349 --> 26:54.047
for admiration
and praise, right?

26:54.090 --> 26:56.789
Mm-hmm.
So, he requires
a partner who will

26:56.832 --> 26:59.705
constantly feed
his narcissistic ego

26:59.748 --> 27:01.228
and sexual appetite.

27:01.271 --> 27:02.664
And since his wife
is clearly not

27:02.708 --> 27:04.797
doing any of that,
I would bet...

27:04.840 --> 27:05.798
Oh, he's got a girlfriend.

27:05.841 --> 27:07.800
Reel her in, you get your man.

27:07.843 --> 27:09.236
That's really good.

27:09.279 --> 27:10.585
Thank you.

27:10.629 --> 27:12.152
Pleasure.

27:12.195 --> 27:13.762
[phone line ringing]

27:15.851 --> 27:18.332
Come on, Bishop, pick up.

27:18.375 --> 27:20.726
BISHOP [on recording]:
Hey, this is Ellie.
Leave a message.

27:21.857 --> 27:23.250
Where's Bishop?

27:23.293 --> 27:24.686
Well, I was hoping
she was with you.

27:24.730 --> 27:25.992
Call her.

27:26.035 --> 27:28.995
I did-- I, uh,
I only got voice mail.

27:29.038 --> 27:30.997
There a problem?

27:31.040 --> 27:32.694
Yeah.

27:32.738 --> 27:34.348
When Bishop
left the hospital

27:34.391 --> 27:36.872
last night, she said she was
coming back to the office.

27:36.916 --> 27:39.396
Well, her name is
not on the night logs

27:39.440 --> 27:40.528
downstairs.

27:40.571 --> 27:41.834
Well, where is she now?

27:41.877 --> 27:43.270
Boss, that's what I'm saying.

27:43.313 --> 27:44.837
Look, we all want

27:44.880 --> 27:47.361
to get this guy-- Bishop
more than any of us.

27:47.404 --> 27:50.581
So, why isn't she here,
helping us find him?

27:50.625 --> 27:51.887
BISHOP:
I'm here now.

27:53.759 --> 27:54.716
Where were you?

27:55.761 --> 27:58.502
I was at the gym, Dad.

27:59.590 --> 28:00.374
Last night.

28:00.417 --> 28:01.984
I worked from home.

28:03.246 --> 28:05.205
What'd I miss?

28:09.209 --> 28:10.819
Xavier has a girlfriend.

28:10.863 --> 28:12.342
[scoffs] Of course he does.The kind that

28:12.386 --> 28:14.649
Sloane said he would
not leave behind.

28:14.693 --> 28:15.650
Oh.

28:15.694 --> 28:16.782
We have a name?

28:16.825 --> 28:18.479
Not yet.Well, we need

28:18.522 --> 28:20.133
to run facial recognition on his
social media accounts.

28:20.176 --> 28:21.264
I bet you she's there.

28:23.484 --> 28:24.877
McGee can handle it.

28:24.920 --> 28:26.835
With me.

28:31.535 --> 28:33.494
Is there a problem?

28:33.537 --> 28:35.670
You tell me.

28:35.714 --> 28:37.193
You're worrying people.

28:37.237 --> 28:40.022
McGee?And Sloane.

28:40.066 --> 28:42.895
What did he tell her?What'd you tell him?

28:44.723 --> 28:47.073
I thought so.

28:47.116 --> 28:49.553
I didn't answer your question.

28:49.597 --> 28:51.773
Sure, you did.

28:51.817 --> 28:53.819
Did you do it?

28:54.994 --> 28:56.256
Take him out?

28:56.299 --> 28:58.606
[laughs]

28:58.649 --> 28:59.868
Really?

28:59.912 --> 29:01.696
McGee thought
I was being serious?

29:01.740 --> 29:03.654
Were you?
I--

29:03.698 --> 29:05.395
I was venting, Gibbs.

29:05.439 --> 29:07.136
Mm-hmm.You really think
that I would...?

29:07.180 --> 29:08.094
Stop.

29:08.137 --> 29:09.791
I can't let you do

29:09.835 --> 29:11.401
something stupid, Bishop.

29:11.445 --> 29:12.620
And since when have you
become the arbiter

29:12.663 --> 29:14.404
on doing something stupid?

29:14.448 --> 29:16.102
Seriously?

29:16.145 --> 29:17.756
A-After all the bad guys

29:17.799 --> 29:19.627
you've handled off the books...

29:19.670 --> 29:22.412
you're gonna protect
Xavier Zolotov?

29:22.456 --> 29:24.110
I'm not protecting him.Then what are you doing?

29:24.153 --> 29:25.502
Protecting you.
From what?

29:25.546 --> 29:26.808
Getting caught?

29:26.852 --> 29:28.505
This is the kind of thing

29:28.549 --> 29:30.638
you never recover from.

29:30.681 --> 29:32.901
You manage.

29:32.945 --> 29:36.687
Do I look happy to you, Bishop?

29:39.038 --> 29:41.083
You do the kind
of things I've done,

29:41.127 --> 29:43.564
you get the kind of things
I've got.

29:45.566 --> 29:48.134
Bourbon and a boat
in the basement.

29:50.310 --> 29:52.355
You don't want to become me.

29:54.053 --> 29:56.055
Too late.

29:59.536 --> 30:02.017
[phone ringing]

30:07.544 --> 30:09.459
Yeah. Gibbs.

30:09.503 --> 30:11.461
All right, Kasie,
time to fire up

30:11.505 --> 30:13.855
that facial recognition
software.

30:13.899 --> 30:16.466
What's up?

30:16.510 --> 30:18.512
Well, we think that
Xavier's mystery girlfriend

30:18.555 --> 30:21.210
is one of the girls
on his social media site.

30:21.254 --> 30:22.342
That's amazing.

30:22.385 --> 30:23.517
Well, not really.

30:23.560 --> 30:24.735
I mean, we've got
hundreds of photos

30:24.779 --> 30:25.954
of women here,
and we need to put

30:25.998 --> 30:27.173
names to the faces.

30:27.216 --> 30:29.044
Oh, that's great news.

30:29.088 --> 30:30.524
What are you talking about?

30:30.567 --> 30:32.221
The clock's ticking.
We got to do this.

30:32.265 --> 30:34.006
I could kiss
you right now.

30:34.049 --> 30:34.963
[laughs]

30:35.007 --> 30:36.356
Ciao.

30:36.399 --> 30:37.618
That was Gibbs.

30:37.661 --> 30:39.925
Torres is awake.

30:39.968 --> 30:41.100
That's great!

30:41.143 --> 30:42.666
He's on his way
there right now.

30:42.710 --> 30:43.972
Oh, he wants to know
if you found the mystery

30:44.016 --> 30:45.756
girlfriend yet?
Clock's ticking, McGee.

30:45.800 --> 30:47.106
Yeah, I've heard.
Look, we need to run

30:47.149 --> 30:48.237
facial recognition

30:48.281 --> 30:49.848
on all of these photos.

30:49.891 --> 30:52.111
Wow, that's a
lot of photos.

30:52.154 --> 30:53.634
That's gonna take a lot of time.

30:53.677 --> 30:55.288
Well, it's the only lead
we have on the girlfriend.

30:55.331 --> 30:56.811
Or is it?

30:56.855 --> 30:58.291
Hey, you like it when
I do the cryptic thing?

30:58.334 --> 31:00.467
Okay, so, as it turns
out, this morning

31:00.510 --> 31:02.077
I went back to the
scene of the crime,

31:02.121 --> 31:04.819
hoping to find a little...
forensical inspiration.

31:04.863 --> 31:07.387
Instead, I found
Brandon Baldwin.

31:07.430 --> 31:08.823
Who's Brandon Baldwin?Brandon Baldwin

31:08.867 --> 31:11.521
was riding a Ducati
in a polo and khakis.

31:11.565 --> 31:13.219
You know, I said to myself,
only a commuter

31:13.262 --> 31:15.351
rides a Ducati
in a polo and khakis.

31:15.395 --> 31:17.832
He also drives past the spot
where Torres was hit

31:17.876 --> 31:19.442
every single day.

31:19.486 --> 31:20.791
Did he see anything?

31:20.835 --> 31:22.402
Not the actual accident itself,

31:22.445 --> 31:23.882
but he did recall Xavier's car,

31:23.925 --> 31:25.709
like, blowing past him.

31:25.753 --> 31:28.669
And was more than happy to share
his helmet-cam footage with me.

31:28.712 --> 31:30.671
Hence, the e-mail
I just received.

31:30.714 --> 31:32.499
Nice.

31:33.979 --> 31:35.502
Okay, this is where

31:35.545 --> 31:37.547
the cryptic thing starts
to get a little annoying.

31:37.591 --> 31:39.201
Oh, yeah, no.
I-I'm-I'm getting there.Thanks.

31:40.376 --> 31:41.682
Ooh!

31:41.725 --> 31:43.075
There's Xavier.

31:43.118 --> 31:46.165
Okay, first
a little "backy-uppy,"

31:46.208 --> 31:47.906
then a little "freezy-wheezy."

31:48.950 --> 31:50.909
McGEE:
His wife's not blonde.

31:50.952 --> 31:52.693
That's got to be the girlfriend.

31:52.736 --> 31:56.697
Then a little "framey-forwardy."

31:56.740 --> 31:59.178
Yeah, I think that's more than
enough for facial recognition.

31:59.221 --> 32:01.528
Don't bother.

32:04.487 --> 32:06.881
McGEE:
The rental agreement
lists her as Colleen Kennedy.

32:06.925 --> 32:10.102
Overdue on her rent and now
looking at up to five years

32:10.145 --> 32:12.191
for leaving the scene
of an accident.

32:12.234 --> 32:14.541
Now, if Sloane's right,
there is no way Xavier

32:14.584 --> 32:17.109
is gonna get on that plane
with her locked up.

32:17.152 --> 32:19.024
[sighs]

32:19.067 --> 32:20.634
You okay?

32:20.677 --> 32:23.202
I was, until about the sixth
time you asked me that.

32:23.245 --> 32:24.812
Hey. Are we ready?

32:24.855 --> 32:26.727
I thought you were
at the hospital.

32:26.770 --> 32:29.121
Thought you could use
the backup.

32:29.164 --> 32:30.818
Okay-- I didn't even need
McGee. What is she gonna do?

32:30.861 --> 32:32.515
Beat me with her yoga mat?

32:32.559 --> 32:34.387
How's Torres?Hungry.

32:34.430 --> 32:36.389
That's a good sign, right?

32:36.432 --> 32:38.173
Is he talking?
Too much.

32:38.217 --> 32:39.740
Keeps asking if you're okay.

32:41.263 --> 32:42.438
Are you okay?

32:50.707 --> 32:52.927
Well, that's an impressive
lack of shame.

32:52.971 --> 32:55.756
Yeah. She and Xavier
are the perfect match.

32:55.799 --> 32:57.279
Spread out. Watch your back.

33:12.294 --> 33:13.426
Kitchen's clear.

33:13.469 --> 33:14.949
BISHOP:
Bedroom's clear!

33:14.993 --> 33:16.385
McGEE:
Bathroom, not clear!

33:16.429 --> 33:17.996
Got a body here.

33:20.085 --> 33:23.088
It's not her.

33:44.109 --> 33:45.371
JIMMY:
I have to get him back

33:45.414 --> 33:47.547
to autopsy for a full analysis,
but I'd say

33:47.590 --> 33:49.114
that the cause of death

33:49.157 --> 33:51.116
is rather obvious.
I'm gonna say

33:51.159 --> 33:53.727
it was the single bullet that
went straight through his head.

33:53.770 --> 33:55.990
While he was
in a bathtub.

33:56.034 --> 33:58.210
I mean, someone couldn't
wait to kill this guy.

33:58.253 --> 34:00.560
I'm sure that's
a pretty long list.

34:00.603 --> 34:02.301
Bishop.

34:03.650 --> 34:05.695
I know you won't be shedding
any tears over him.

34:08.916 --> 34:10.091
Time of death, Palmer.

34:10.135 --> 34:11.397
Stand by

34:11.440 --> 34:13.355
while Mr. Liver Probe
does his thing.

34:14.965 --> 34:16.402
Come on, you really think
that I would...?

34:16.445 --> 34:17.838
Bishop, I'd rather not.

34:17.881 --> 34:19.057
You'd rather not what?I would rather not

34:19.100 --> 34:20.710
have this discussion.

34:20.754 --> 34:22.234
Because whatever
you're about to say,

34:22.277 --> 34:23.844
you're gonna say it
regardless of what happened.

34:23.887 --> 34:25.063
JIMMY:
Got a time of death.

34:25.106 --> 34:26.238
Bathwater
made it difficult

34:26.281 --> 34:28.196
to be precise,
but it's sometime in the last

34:28.240 --> 34:30.764
five hours.

34:30.807 --> 34:34.681
You know, there are no gunpowder
burns on the back of his head.

34:35.725 --> 34:38.685
And that shot is dead center.

34:38.728 --> 34:42.123
The killer must have had
some weapons experience.

34:42.167 --> 34:43.733
Just a guess.

34:43.777 --> 34:45.735
Jimmy, any idea who
that killer might be?

34:45.779 --> 34:46.736
Okay.
BISHOP:
Yeah, Jimmy.

34:46.780 --> 34:47.781
Any idea?

34:47.824 --> 34:50.175
Well, there's no casings around,

34:50.218 --> 34:52.220
which means either
it was a revolver

34:52.264 --> 34:53.830
or the killer policed his brass.

34:53.874 --> 34:57.269
I mean, they even took
the bullet home with them. I...

34:57.312 --> 34:58.487
Whoever did this

34:58.531 --> 35:01.708
is gonna be
incredibly hard to find.

35:01.751 --> 35:03.492
E-- Except...

35:03.536 --> 35:05.581
Hold on.

35:05.625 --> 35:07.148
Something here.

35:08.323 --> 35:12.284
That is a hair.

35:12.327 --> 35:15.635
That is long and
that is blonde.

35:15.678 --> 35:18.681
And not Xavier's.

35:18.725 --> 35:19.987
Might be
the killer's.

35:25.514 --> 35:28.082
Well, I know who my number one
suspect would be.

35:32.869 --> 35:34.088
Her.

35:37.874 --> 35:41.356
The body was in her bathtub,
after all.

35:44.881 --> 35:46.840
BISHOP:
And Kasie said it isher hair,

35:46.883 --> 35:48.842
but it doesn't prove anything.

35:48.885 --> 35:50.844
I mean, my hair is everywhere
in my apartment.

35:50.887 --> 35:52.846
We need a motive.

35:52.889 --> 35:56.328
Unfortunately, the only one
to have one right now is you.

35:57.764 --> 35:58.808
Gibbs.

35:58.852 --> 35:59.853
I know you didn't do it.

35:59.896 --> 36:01.855
How do you know that?

36:01.898 --> 36:03.509
Okay.

36:03.552 --> 36:04.858
Did you?

36:06.903 --> 36:09.428
In my head, a hundred times.

36:09.471 --> 36:12.866
I planned it down
to the last detail.

36:12.909 --> 36:16.826
The only problem was,
besides getting caught,

36:16.870 --> 36:19.829
like you said,
I am the only one with motive.

36:19.873 --> 36:21.657
Actually, not really.

36:21.701 --> 36:24.007
We did some digging into
Colleen's background.

36:24.051 --> 36:27.228
Turns out, a few years
ago, her parents died.

36:27.272 --> 36:29.796
Left her and her baby sister
a boatload of cash.

36:29.839 --> 36:32.059
Except her sister never got it.

36:32.102 --> 36:34.714
She OD'd on heroin
before they had a chance

36:34.757 --> 36:35.932
to settle the estate.

36:35.976 --> 36:37.020
Sounds like Colleen
had the worst luck

36:37.064 --> 36:38.761
in the world, right? Wrong.

36:38.805 --> 36:41.547
McGEE:
Local law enforcement
suspected foul play.

36:41.590 --> 36:42.983
They think that Colleen killed
her sister so she wouldn't

36:43.026 --> 36:44.724
have to share
the inheritance.

36:44.767 --> 36:48.118
NCIS Great Lakes sent an agent
undercover to make a case.

36:49.294 --> 36:51.252
Torres.

36:52.297 --> 36:54.168
He didn't think

36:54.212 --> 36:55.300
it was an overdose either.

36:55.343 --> 36:56.344
The report says

36:56.388 --> 36:57.911
Colleen injected
her sister

36:57.954 --> 37:00.174
with dirty heroin
while she was sleeping.

37:00.218 --> 37:02.785
Except Great Lakes
couldn't prove it,

37:02.829 --> 37:04.222
and the case ended there.

37:04.265 --> 37:06.528
Except it didn't end, did it?

37:06.572 --> 37:09.270
SLOANE:
Nope. I just got off
the phone with the JAG lawyer

37:09.314 --> 37:11.316
who's handling
the prosecution.

37:11.359 --> 37:14.057
New evidence has come to light,
and they're reopening the case.

37:14.101 --> 37:17.539
And guess who their
star witness is gonna be.

37:19.628 --> 37:23.502
Our accident wasn't an accident.

37:23.545 --> 37:25.112
It was a hit.

37:25.155 --> 37:27.636
Now, Colleen was trying to stop
Torres from testifying.

37:28.811 --> 37:31.292
Hey! He's still a target.

38:01.366 --> 38:03.585
â™ª

38:28.697 --> 38:30.699
â™ª

38:41.231 --> 38:42.929
GIBBS:
NCIS. Don't move.

38:44.060 --> 38:45.671
BISHOP:
That's not very creative.

38:45.714 --> 38:48.021
You kill all your victims
with bad heroin?

38:48.064 --> 38:50.023
I-- Wait, I
th-thought you said

38:50.066 --> 38:53.113
that she had, uh, shot her
new boyfriend in the head.

38:55.811 --> 38:59.293
Hey, Colleen.
It's been a while, girl.

38:59.337 --> 39:01.687
This is a setup.
You guys are setting me up.

39:01.730 --> 39:04.907
You're literally holding
the murder weapon in your hand.

39:06.387 --> 39:07.823
[exhales]

39:07.867 --> 39:10.783
You were the worst boyfriend
I've ever had.

39:10.826 --> 39:12.262
No, I was not.

39:12.306 --> 39:14.874
See you in
court, Collie.

39:18.791 --> 39:22.925
You are also the worst
pretend sleeper I've ever seen.

39:22.969 --> 39:24.405
Bishop, please.

39:24.449 --> 39:25.798
You know, I'm so badass,

39:25.841 --> 39:28.148
I can catch bad guys
from a hospital bed.

39:28.191 --> 39:30.193
Okay, Mr. Badass.

39:30.237 --> 39:31.804
How about jumping
out of the way of the car

39:31.847 --> 39:33.022
the next time it comes at you?

39:33.066 --> 39:34.415
Like I did.

39:34.459 --> 39:36.896
[laughs]

39:36.939 --> 39:38.288
Don't even.

39:38.332 --> 39:39.638
[stifled laugh]

39:42.162 --> 39:45.426
'Cause you know I risked my life
to save yours.

39:52.172 --> 39:54.566
I know.

40:00.136 --> 40:01.442
McGEE:
Colleen must
have gotten wind

40:01.486 --> 40:03.139
that her case was
heating up again.

40:03.183 --> 40:06.142
Yeah, but she knew it was dead
in the water without Torres.

40:06.186 --> 40:09.581
So she talked her boyfriend into
mowing him down with his car.

40:09.624 --> 40:10.799
Young love.

40:10.843 --> 40:12.148
Kind of sweet.BISHOP:
But she must have

40:12.192 --> 40:13.672
gotten nervous when
she found out Xavier

40:13.715 --> 40:15.935
got caught and decided
to take him out.

40:15.978 --> 40:17.371
Maybe not so sweet.

40:17.415 --> 40:19.112
McGEE:
Yeah, she denies
killing Xavier,

40:19.155 --> 40:20.809
still claims that
she was set up,

40:20.853 --> 40:22.942
but we've got her red-handed
on the attempt with Torres.

40:22.985 --> 40:25.205
So I think she's going away
for a long time.

40:25.248 --> 40:26.728
Hmm. Works for me.

40:26.772 --> 40:28.469
All right. Have a good one.Uh, excuse me, Director.

40:28.513 --> 40:29.688
Yeah.
I just...

40:30.732 --> 40:32.038
I, um...

40:32.081 --> 40:34.170
About what
I said before,

40:34.214 --> 40:35.650
I just wanted to...

40:35.694 --> 40:36.912
I know.

40:36.956 --> 40:38.653
Okay.

40:40.263 --> 40:41.743
McGEE: Hey, boss, is it
true you ordered Torres

40:41.787 --> 40:44.703
to sleep on your couch when
he gets out of the hospital?

40:44.746 --> 40:46.835
He has to stay someplace.

40:46.879 --> 40:49.229
Uh, yeah, but hasn't he been
through enough already?

40:49.272 --> 40:50.622
Yeah, I mean,
he just got out of a coma.

40:50.665 --> 40:52.275
Now he's got to eat
from your fireplace?

40:54.669 --> 40:56.062
[chuckles]:
Well, he...

40:56.105 --> 40:58.107
He likes my fireplace.

40:58.151 --> 40:59.892
Okay.

41:00.936 --> 41:02.938
[chuckles]

41:14.776 --> 41:16.778
What?

41:16.822 --> 41:18.563
You know, Colleen
was really adamant

41:18.606 --> 41:20.434
about not killing Xavier.

41:20.478 --> 41:22.523
I heard.And, uh,

41:22.567 --> 41:25.221
the evidence we have against her
is all circumstantial.

41:25.265 --> 41:26.440
All of it.

41:26.484 --> 41:27.920
What's your point?

41:27.963 --> 41:31.140
Where'd you go when
you left the hospital?

41:33.926 --> 41:35.275
[exhales]

41:35.318 --> 41:36.450
It wasn't me, McGee.

41:36.494 --> 41:38.757
Bishop, I know it wasn't you.

41:38.800 --> 41:40.541
Look, I just, I, um...

41:40.585 --> 41:43.109
I have this feeling. I can't
quite put my finger on it.

41:43.152 --> 41:45.067
Look,

41:45.111 --> 41:46.895
if you didn't kill Xavier,

41:46.939 --> 41:51.204
Colleen says she didn't
kill him, who did?
