01:00.147 --> 01:02.018
Come on, Red. Giddyup.

01:02.018 --> 01:04.020
Giddyup, come on.
Ride 'em, cowboy.

01:04.020 --> 01:06.762
Let's get those outlaws.

01:06.762 --> 01:08.111
We're almost there.
Come on!

01:08.111 --> 01:11.027
Got it. We got it.
We're almost there.

01:11.027 --> 01:12.681
Come on.

01:25.694 --> 01:27.087
Hey, Boyd.

01:28.088 --> 01:31.047
How long were you out
in the corn?

01:31.047 --> 01:34.137
Not all night again,
I hope.

01:53.896 --> 01:56.768
I don't want you
to cry anymore, Eden.

02:11.609 --> 02:13.611
Don't worry, Eden.

02:13.611 --> 02:16.048
Nothing ever really dies
in the corn.

02:25.710 --> 02:28.757
Boyd! Damn it.
Where the hell you been?

02:33.979 --> 02:35.503
Boyd...

02:36.852 --> 02:38.419
Boyd, no!

02:47.123 --> 02:50.387
<i>All units be advised,
there is a hostage situation</i>

02:50.387 --> 02:51.997
<i>at the
Rylstone Children's Home.</i>

02:51.997 --> 02:53.999
<i>The local sheriff
and his farmer buddies</i>

02:53.999 --> 02:56.001
<i>have used some kind of
animal sedative gas</i>

02:56.001 --> 02:57.742
<i>to try and solve it.</i>

02:57.742 --> 03:00.919
<i>By all reports, it sounds like
a total disaster.</i>

03:00.919 --> 03:02.617
<i>Yeah, I'm here now.</i>

03:02.617 --> 03:04.488
<i>These idiots are literally
pumping halothane in</i>

03:04.488 --> 03:06.011
<i>to try to take this kid down.</i>

03:55.452 --> 03:58.325
Well, there goes
my reelection.

03:58.325 --> 04:01.763
The only silver lining is that
goddamn space cadet in there.

04:01.763 --> 04:04.853
That little runt was wandering
around the corn for four days

04:04.853 --> 04:07.290
before anybody realized
she wasn't one of the casualties

04:07.290 --> 04:08.857
from the goddamn gas.

04:08.857 --> 04:11.338
Pastor, try and find out
if that boy said anything

04:11.338 --> 04:13.035
that would explain
why he snapped

04:13.035 --> 04:15.037
and killed all those people.

04:25.482 --> 04:26.614
So...

04:29.660 --> 04:33.795
I guess it follows that, uh,

04:33.795 --> 04:37.538
you'll need a place to live
after all this, huh?

04:40.192 --> 04:42.194
Who knows?

04:42.194 --> 04:43.631
If you're a good girl,

04:43.631 --> 04:47.112
then maybe
we could manage it

04:47.112 --> 04:49.506
for you to come and live
with me.

04:51.029 --> 04:54.511
I have a stable with
a couple of old nags in it.

04:54.511 --> 04:57.340
You can pick one out
and ride it.

04:57.340 --> 04:59.211
How's that sound?

04:59.211 --> 05:01.823
God dang it!

05:01.823 --> 05:04.173
This one piece
is driving me nuts!

05:11.311 --> 05:12.747
Oh.

05:17.534 --> 05:20.668
There she is.
The Red Queen.

05:21.625 --> 05:24.324
You like the Red Queen?

05:24.324 --> 05:27.718
The Red Queen makes the world
the way she wants it to be.

05:29.329 --> 05:32.506
E-Eden, I'm-- I'm really sorry
about what happened

05:32.506 --> 05:34.246
to all your little friends
in the home.

05:34.246 --> 05:36.379
I really am.

05:36.379 --> 05:39.948
It was
an unfortunate accident.

05:39.948 --> 05:43.255
I-I have to ask you--

05:43.255 --> 05:47.869
That boy,
did he say anything?

05:50.567 --> 05:52.308
No.
Not really.

05:54.136 --> 05:58.880
Oh, uh, except just to say
he was sorry.

06:00.229 --> 06:03.014
Sorry?

06:03.014 --> 06:06.278
Sorry for killing every adult
in the facility?

06:06.278 --> 06:07.932
No.

06:07.932 --> 06:10.805
I think he was sorry
for not killing all of you.

06:36.483 --> 06:38.920
Hey! Get back!

06:38.920 --> 06:40.182
Hey, what's wrong with you?!

06:40.182 --> 06:41.488
That should be public!

07:15.696 --> 07:17.001
Cool.

07:23.094 --> 07:25.183
Look at this stuff.

07:25.183 --> 07:30.493
How many times
did I try and warn them?

07:30.493 --> 07:32.495
The stuff that they put
into this ground

07:32.495 --> 07:36.281
without even barely
reading a label.

07:36.281 --> 07:38.980
Ever notice how the words
"maize" and "maze"--

07:38.980 --> 07:42.287
like a corn maize
and a puzzle-- are the same?

07:42.287 --> 07:45.116
A maze of maize.

07:45.116 --> 07:46.161
Weird, huh?

07:46.161 --> 07:48.076
Sure. "Amazing."

07:48.076 --> 07:49.860
Har-dee-har.
Bite me.

07:50.992 --> 07:53.124
Hey!

07:53.124 --> 07:56.519
Toxins grow on the stalks
and leaves of rotting crops.

07:56.519 --> 07:58.347
It's a fungus.

07:58.347 --> 08:02.612
It can make you sick
or even die.

08:06.050 --> 08:07.182
Yeah.

08:07.182 --> 08:09.619
And, uh, hallucinations.

08:09.619 --> 08:12.796
- Whatever you say, Bo.
- What? It's true.

08:12.796 --> 08:14.624
You know, some people say
it was responsible

08:14.624 --> 08:16.539
for the Salem witch trials.

08:16.539 --> 08:18.062
Fun talking to you too, sis.

08:20.587 --> 08:22.502
Ahh!

08:22.502 --> 08:27.028
Mmm! Smell those toxins.
Velvety and delicious.

08:27.028 --> 08:28.551
- So good.
- Ceece, stop.

08:28.551 --> 08:30.031
Think I'll have
a second helping.

08:30.031 --> 08:31.989
Cut it out. Stop playing
with that stuff, okay?

08:31.989 --> 08:35.297
Now, listen to me. I...

08:35.297 --> 08:38.909
That's not why
I brought you out here, okay?

08:38.909 --> 08:40.345
<i>This</i> is.

08:41.346 --> 08:46.047
I literally haven't been able
to sleep for a month

08:46.047 --> 08:47.831
because I...

08:51.531 --> 08:53.054
Here.

09:01.366 --> 09:04.021
I leave next week.

09:04.021 --> 09:08.983
Look, it's an undergraduate
degree in microbiology.

09:08.983 --> 09:11.812
All right?
It's not an eternity.

09:11.812 --> 09:13.596
It is.

09:16.077 --> 09:18.035
It is!
Why would you ever come back?

09:18.035 --> 09:20.168
I know you hate it here.

09:20.168 --> 09:22.039
Because.

09:23.127 --> 09:27.262
Because of you.
Because of Dad.

09:27.262 --> 09:33.790
And look, Ceece, you know,
you'll leave here one day too.

09:33.790 --> 09:35.923
With <i>my</i> cruddy grades?

09:37.011 --> 09:39.056
I'll be stuck here forever.

09:40.057 --> 09:43.278
In this creepy, dying place.

09:43.278 --> 09:45.585
No.
Rylstone's not dying.

09:47.238 --> 09:49.763
It's been a hard couple years.
You know?

09:49.763 --> 09:51.286
A lot of mistakes
have been made.

09:51.286 --> 09:54.158
A lot of
shitty, shitty decisions.

09:54.158 --> 09:57.684
But with-- with a little time
and care,

09:57.684 --> 10:00.425
then all this...

10:01.818 --> 10:03.777
...it can be fixed.

10:05.822 --> 10:06.910
Yeah.

10:08.695 --> 10:10.784
Sounds awesome, Bo.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.573
Eden! God, you scared
the shit out of us.

10:17.573 --> 10:19.053
Seriously.

10:20.010 --> 10:21.011
What's with the wig?

10:21.011 --> 10:26.713
Today I am the Red Queen.

19:02.750 --> 19:04.926
- Walk the plank!
- God!

19:05.883 --> 19:07.363
Jesus, what...

19:07.363 --> 19:09.974
So are the Salem witch trials
over already?

19:09.974 --> 19:12.673
It was pretty sweet.
Wally was freaking out.

19:12.673 --> 19:15.850
Everybody was screaming
and yelling and shouting

19:15.850 --> 19:17.504
and dancing through the corn.

19:17.504 --> 19:19.201
It was pretty dope.

19:19.201 --> 19:21.116
Mom?

19:22.987 --> 19:24.946
Ceece.
Let's go. Come on.

19:30.299 --> 19:33.737
Ceece, that's between
Mom and Dad.

19:33.737 --> 19:36.740
Okay? Ceece.
Come on.

19:36.740 --> 19:39.352
Bo, you are so blind.

19:39.352 --> 19:40.701
It's not about Mom.

19:40.701 --> 19:43.182
It's not about Dad.

19:44.922 --> 19:46.881
It's about Rylstone.

19:46.881 --> 19:51.364
It's about this place
that's so broken

19:51.364 --> 19:54.105
that nobody even gives
a damn enough to try to fix it.

19:54.105 --> 19:57.631
But, then, I guess that's not
your problem anymore, is it, Bo?

19:59.198 --> 20:00.895
Enjoy Boston.

20:20.131 --> 20:23.396
Corn-- our corn--
is dying.

20:23.396 --> 20:24.962
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:24.962 --> 20:27.313
In the fields
not 500 yards from here,

20:27.313 --> 20:32.100
as far as the eye can see,
is a sea of dying brown.

20:32.100 --> 20:34.668
What happened
to the glorious golden grain

20:34.668 --> 20:35.973
that we grew up with,

20:35.973 --> 20:38.367
that our forefathers
planted here?

20:38.367 --> 20:39.977
Well, we know what happened.

20:39.977 --> 20:42.284
We voted, and a majority--

20:42.284 --> 20:44.721
a majority you know
I disagreed with-- ruled.

20:44.721 --> 20:47.768
So we invited Big Corn, GrowSynth,

20:47.768 --> 20:49.335
right into our fields

20:49.335 --> 20:52.425
with their arsenal
of herbicides and GMOs.

20:52.425 --> 20:54.427
And look what happened
to the corn.

20:54.427 --> 20:55.645
Just didn't even know.

20:57.168 --> 20:58.605
That's what happened
to my corn.

20:58.605 --> 21:01.216
- That's right.
- That's what happened.

21:05.742 --> 21:07.440
There's no sense
pointing fingers

21:07.440 --> 21:09.137
because what's done is done.

21:09.137 --> 21:12.488
But what that means is
we have to face a new reality.

21:12.488 --> 21:16.753
Or maybe, just maybe,

21:16.753 --> 21:20.322
all those fingers are pointing
the wrong way anyhow.

21:22.542 --> 21:26.633
That blight
that struck our corn,

21:26.633 --> 21:30.463
maybe it's got a lot less to do
with GrowSynth

21:30.463 --> 21:33.248
or any GMOs
we put in our soil

21:33.248 --> 21:37.208
and more to do with us,
more to do with you.

21:38.471 --> 21:40.473
Sit down, old man.

21:40.473 --> 21:45.129
Maybe what's happening
out there in our corn

21:45.129 --> 21:48.481
is less about
an agricultural calamity

21:48.481 --> 21:52.702
and more about a moral
and spiritual abomination

21:52.702 --> 21:55.226
that has engulfed this town!

21:55.226 --> 21:57.794
Okay, now that
we're done listening

21:57.794 --> 22:01.929
to that sanctimonious,
Holy Rolling horse crap.

22:01.929 --> 22:04.018
It isn't about any of the
cheating or the backstabbing

22:04.018 --> 22:05.411
that's been going on.

22:05.411 --> 22:07.978
It's about one thing
and one thing only.

22:07.978 --> 22:10.024
Now, we was sold
a hill of beans.

22:10.024 --> 22:11.112
- That's right.
- Yeah!

22:11.112 --> 22:12.374
All we had to do,
they said,

22:12.374 --> 22:14.028
was put this
put that in the soil

22:14.028 --> 22:16.552
and alter our corn
so we could sell more soda

22:16.552 --> 22:18.293
to the poor kids
in the Third World.

22:18.293 --> 22:20.339
Do that, they said,
and we'd be rich.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.341
Richer than we could dream.

22:22.341 --> 22:24.430
But instead,
look at what happened.

22:24.430 --> 22:26.736
Sick corn
and economic disaster.

22:26.736 --> 22:30.000
And that's why Rylstone
has to leave corn behind.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.785
This is how we can do it.

22:31.785 --> 22:33.177
Subsidies.

22:33.177 --> 22:34.701
Subsidies?

22:34.701 --> 22:37.443
Federal government
will subsidize-- pay us--

22:37.443 --> 22:39.270
not to grow corn.

22:39.270 --> 22:42.317
But this program's fiscal year
ends in less than two days,

22:42.317 --> 22:45.015
so we got to say yes
and we got to do it now.

22:45.015 --> 22:47.844
We got earthmovers
right at the edge of town

22:47.844 --> 22:52.327
ready to dig the trench
to bury our corn.

22:52.327 --> 22:54.677
And I don't want this
any more than you do.

22:54.677 --> 22:58.072
And look, it's not ideal,
I admit that,

22:58.072 --> 23:02.381
but I don't think
we have a choice.

23:02.381 --> 23:05.079
Yeah, well,
I disagree, Dad.

23:08.604 --> 23:10.911
You all should be ashamed.

23:10.911 --> 23:14.001
Instead of being the adults
when we needed you to be,

23:14.001 --> 23:17.874
you helped yourselves and left
the rest of us traumatized.

23:17.874 --> 23:20.442
Rylstone sold its soul
once already.

23:20.442 --> 23:22.183
And all you're doing
to solve the problem,

23:22.183 --> 23:25.491
instead of trying
to repair the soil,

23:25.491 --> 23:27.188
is infighting.

23:27.188 --> 23:31.410
Infighting and selling
all our souls all over again

23:31.410 --> 23:35.501
as fast as you can,
just to a different master.

23:35.501 --> 23:38.895
But you do have a choice.

23:38.895 --> 23:42.159
Trust me,
it's not the one you're making.

23:45.641 --> 23:47.687
My beautiful daughter, Bo.

23:49.384 --> 23:50.733
Thank you.

23:50.733 --> 23:53.301
Most heartfelt and passionate,
as always.

23:53.301 --> 23:56.478
And I wish
I shared your optimism.

23:56.478 --> 24:00.569
But trying to restore the soil
could take years.

24:00.569 --> 24:02.832
We're simply out of time.

24:02.832 --> 24:05.792
If you try to fix this,
something this broken...

24:07.141 --> 24:09.752
...you mark my words, you're
just going to make it worse.

24:12.538 --> 24:14.148
So let's put it to a vote.

24:14.148 --> 24:16.629
No, Robert,
I-I really must--

24:16.629 --> 24:19.370
Sit down, Pastor.
No one cares.

24:19.370 --> 24:22.635
I say aye.
Let those threshers roll.

24:22.635 --> 24:24.637
Let them big boys go!

24:24.637 --> 24:27.770
Yeah. Florida time-share,
here I come.

24:27.770 --> 24:29.816
Corn economy can kiss my ass.

24:29.816 --> 24:30.947
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

24:30.947 --> 24:32.688
See a show of hands?

24:36.518 --> 24:39.869
All right. We're doing this.
Everyone's voted.

24:40.653 --> 24:42.872
Except everyone hasn't voted.

24:46.963 --> 24:49.052
Not us.

24:49.052 --> 24:51.446
The children.

24:51.446 --> 24:53.274
They're right.

24:53.274 --> 24:55.624
It's the little ones'
futures too.

24:55.624 --> 24:58.322
Yeah, they don't even get
a vote, a say.

24:58.322 --> 25:00.977
'Cause Bo is right.
We have a choice.

25:00.977 --> 25:02.805
All right, enough horseshit.

25:04.328 --> 25:06.722
Children?
Having a say?

25:08.115 --> 25:11.553
I thought 17-year-olds
mouthing off was bad enough.

25:11.553 --> 25:14.556
- Stupid kids.

25:14.556 --> 25:15.949
Hear, hear.

25:18.429 --> 25:19.561
Little kids!

25:20.954 --> 25:22.259
Voting!

25:25.393 --> 25:27.874
Yeah, well, I vote you go home
and play with your toys.

25:27.874 --> 25:29.528
Okay, little girl?

25:29.528 --> 25:33.314
How does that sound?
Yeah?

25:33.314 --> 25:36.099
You too, boy.
You just wait till I get home.

25:36.099 --> 25:37.840
You just wait, boy.

25:39.059 --> 25:41.452
Hey, come on!
Hey! Hey!

25:45.065 --> 25:46.849
That's a child,
for Christ's sake.

25:54.988 --> 25:56.555
- Hey!
- You're gonna be fine.

25:56.555 --> 25:59.601
All right, knock it off.
That's enough. Knock it off!

26:01.298 --> 26:03.213
What is wrong with you?

26:03.213 --> 26:05.346
Okay.
It's settled.

26:05.346 --> 26:07.261
In less than 48 hours,

26:07.261 --> 26:10.743
corn will be dead
in Rylstone forever.

26:10.743 --> 26:13.354
Yes. Thank you.

26:13.354 --> 26:15.486
You're saying
what we've been thinking.

28:11.080 --> 28:12.821
Dad.

28:15.998 --> 28:21.438
Listen, it doesn't
have to be like this.

28:21.438 --> 28:25.878
It's not too late
to do something.

28:25.878 --> 28:28.315
Give it a rest, Bo.
It's done.

28:41.458 --> 28:45.724
Since when do you ever,
ever run from a fight?

28:45.724 --> 28:48.335
I distinguish, Bo,

28:48.335 --> 28:50.729
between fighting for
and fighting with.

28:52.818 --> 28:55.777
Are you talking about Rylstone
or Mom?

28:56.386 --> 28:58.519
What?
It's just...

28:58.519 --> 29:01.043
It's done, Bo.
It's over.

29:05.656 --> 29:07.354
It's done.

29:11.619 --> 29:13.360
What happened to you?

29:17.451 --> 29:22.108
You used to be
so different.

29:41.388 --> 29:43.520
I have had enough of you!

29:43.520 --> 29:46.872
You need to get out of
this house!

29:46.872 --> 29:48.699
Get out of this house!

30:01.930 --> 30:03.192
The adults.

30:03.192 --> 30:05.238
I know.

30:06.326 --> 30:08.545
It sucks.

30:08.545 --> 30:11.244
It's so hard sometimes
you can hardly breathe.

30:14.508 --> 30:16.815
But I can help.

30:16.815 --> 30:18.599
With your pain.

My father thinks
if we try to fix this,

31:47.296 --> 31:48.907
it'll only make things worse.

31:48.907 --> 31:51.910
But he's wrong.
We can fix this.

31:51.910 --> 31:55.696
And this is how--
public humiliation.

31:55.696 --> 31:57.437
Okay?

31:57.437 --> 32:01.310
We graphically show the world
what they did to Rylstone,

32:01.310 --> 32:05.227
to us, to the corn.

32:05.227 --> 32:07.229
Sheila Boyce.

32:07.229 --> 32:10.102
Omaha.
Reporter for NowCloud.

32:10.102 --> 32:12.539
I DM'd her and told her
about our situation,

32:12.539 --> 32:15.498
that maybe she could cover
the story, and she responded.

32:15.498 --> 32:16.978
- What?
- Yeah.

32:16.978 --> 32:18.545
So are you with me?

32:18.545 --> 32:20.764
We doing this?

32:20.764 --> 32:23.202
You in or out?

32:26.292 --> 32:27.249
Let's do it.

32:27.249 --> 32:28.772
- Yeah.
- Are you kidding?

32:28.772 --> 32:30.949
- What are we waiting for?
- Okay.

32:30.949 --> 32:32.428
Here goes.

32:40.045 --> 32:42.003
<i>Hello? Hi.</i>

32:42.003 --> 32:43.004
<i>Boleyn Williams?</i>

32:43.004 --> 32:44.919
Yeah, yes!

32:44.919 --> 32:48.575
Miss Boyce, thank you so much
for taking my call.

33:00.717 --> 33:02.328
Eden?

33:02.328 --> 33:06.158
Jesus, what--
what is all that?

33:06.158 --> 33:07.637
Blood.

33:07.637 --> 33:09.596
What blood?

33:11.772 --> 33:13.208
From Dylan's pop's hog.

33:13.208 --> 33:15.123
We're painting
the corn roots red.

33:16.907 --> 33:18.735
Like the Red Queen.

33:18.735 --> 33:20.433
"Alice in Wonderland."

33:22.957 --> 33:24.654
Got to feed the corn somehow.

33:38.581 --> 33:41.367
Okay, so you really
you want to heal the corn, huh?

33:41.367 --> 33:43.586
You want to save the corn?
All right.

33:43.586 --> 33:46.372
As the, uh, queen,
I need your help.

33:46.372 --> 33:49.940
I need you and all your little
army of friends to go out,

33:49.940 --> 33:52.856
tell Pastor Penny,
tell your parents, everyone,

33:52.856 --> 33:54.075
all the adults.

33:54.075 --> 33:55.990
Kind of fib, okay?

33:55.990 --> 33:59.385
You tell them that my father
is calling an emergency meeting

33:59.385 --> 34:01.126
about that corn
they're gonna plow under.

34:01.126 --> 34:02.823
And I need you
to make absolutely sure

34:02.823 --> 34:06.261
they're at the community hall
by 10:00 p.m. tonight.

34:06.261 --> 34:09.482
Think you can do that?

34:09.482 --> 34:12.572
Yeah. Okay.
I'll help you do this, Bo.

34:12.572 --> 34:15.401
But why the community hall?

34:15.401 --> 34:20.101
Oh, 'cause we are gonna
have us a trial.

34:20.101 --> 34:24.018
And you know, you can't have
a trial without a courthouse.

34:24.018 --> 34:27.369
Plus, we got this big-time
newswoman coming in from Omaha.

34:27.369 --> 34:29.023
So I need you to meet her
on the road in,

34:29.023 --> 34:30.503
bring her
to the community hall too.

34:30.503 --> 34:34.072
Don't forget--
10:00 p.m. sharp.

34:42.819 --> 34:44.517
I'll see you later.

34:46.823 --> 34:47.911
Come on.

34:48.869 --> 34:50.436
<i>You murderer.</i>

34:50.436 --> 34:53.265
<i>Sneak up behind you
and lay something heavy</i>

34:53.265 --> 34:57.269
<i>across your skull
and end this once and for all.</i>

34:57.269 --> 35:02.100
<i>You're a bad man.
You're a very bad man!</i>

35:02.100 --> 35:06.495
<i>You think that.
Go ahead, Anthony.</i>

35:06.495 --> 35:09.933
<i>I'm a very bad man.
Keep thinking that.</i>

35:11.413 --> 35:13.502
<i>Somebody sneak up
behind him.</i>

35:13.502 --> 35:18.420
<i>Somebody end this now
while he's thinking about me!</i>

35:32.478 --> 35:33.522
Aah!

35:45.882 --> 35:47.754
<i>Wish it
into the cornfield.</i>

35:47.754 --> 35:49.930
<i>Please, son, wish it
into the cornfield, please.</i>

35:49.930 --> 35:53.629
Well, beddy-bye for me.

35:53.629 --> 35:55.327
Yeah.
I'm beat.

35:57.590 --> 35:59.505
How about you, Dad?

35:59.505 --> 36:02.595
<i>A jack-in-the-box
that still had his bad face.</i>

36:02.595 --> 36:04.771
<i>You mustn't think
bad thoughts...</i>

36:04.771 --> 36:06.773
Don't stay up too late, okay?

36:07.643 --> 36:10.777
<i>Or I'll do the same thing
to you.</i>

36:46.160 --> 36:49.294
Are we making
a childish mistake, Ceece?

36:49.294 --> 36:53.428
It's never a mistake to try
and change the world, Bo.

37:28.811 --> 37:30.639
What are you guys doing?

37:30.639 --> 37:32.815
Dad, you know
how you told me

37:32.815 --> 37:34.904
some things
are worth fighting for?

37:34.904 --> 37:37.733
Well, I guess
you raised me right,

37:37.733 --> 37:39.735
because that's what's happening.

37:39.735 --> 37:43.043
We're holding a mock trial,
and you're the guest of honor.

37:43.043 --> 37:44.784
Don't wake Mom.

37:44.784 --> 37:49.571
Come quietly, and I promise you
this will be over soon.

38:17.512 --> 38:19.688
You sure about this, Bo?

38:19.688 --> 38:21.864
Yeah, come on, Calder.
We're already late.

38:37.402 --> 38:39.360
Where is everyone?

39:07.867 --> 39:10.565
No, it's okay.
Trust me.

39:33.893 --> 39:35.285
Hi, Bo.

39:35.721 --> 39:37.418
Eden.

39:39.377 --> 39:42.467
Where's everybody?
Where's the reporter?

39:42.467 --> 39:44.860
Sheila Boyce.

39:44.860 --> 39:46.122
Who?

39:47.167 --> 39:51.476
The reporter.
From Omaha.

39:51.476 --> 39:54.783
You were supposed to
pick her up.

39:54.783 --> 39:56.698
She never showed.

39:58.221 --> 40:00.789
Guess something more important
must have come up.

40:03.749 --> 40:05.794
Did she...

40:08.101 --> 40:11.147
Doesn't really
matter anymore, Bo.

40:11.147 --> 40:12.497
It's over.

40:15.282 --> 40:16.936
What is?
What's over?

40:16.936 --> 40:18.851
You were late.

40:18.851 --> 40:20.635
So we just went ahead
and did it.

40:20.635 --> 40:22.376
You did what?

40:23.551 --> 40:24.944
The trial.

40:35.563 --> 40:37.739
Where are the parents?

40:37.739 --> 40:39.698
Where is everyone?

40:41.787 --> 40:42.701
Cam.

40:44.703 --> 40:46.748
Where's Dad?

40:48.358 --> 40:50.273
What the hell is going on?

40:55.888 --> 40:57.803
Want to see something, Bo?

41:38.365 --> 41:40.541
Didn't agree with the verdict,
I guess.

41:42.151 --> 41:45.241
It was always gonna take more
with these kind of people, Bo.

41:46.591 --> 41:47.679
A lot more.

41:49.028 --> 41:50.986
Calder!

41:52.118 --> 41:54.033
Dad?
Dad!

41:54.033 --> 41:56.470
Help me!
- Lift him! Lift him up!

41:57.558 --> 41:59.386
Lift! Lift him!

42:02.476 --> 42:04.173
Let's go.

42:04.173 --> 42:06.219
Dad!

42:06.219 --> 42:07.568
Dad.

42:11.398 --> 42:14.444
No! No! No! No!

42:28.371 --> 42:30.199
He's not laughing now.

43:25.733 --> 43:27.996
Check us out!

43:31.521 --> 43:33.088
Yeah!

43:40.008 --> 43:41.749
Come on!
Come on!

43:49.235 --> 43:50.497
This is outrageous!

43:52.107 --> 43:54.719
I swear, it's gonna
rain down with hellfire.

43:57.591 --> 43:59.506
I'm talking to you, Eden.

44:04.380 --> 44:06.382
Eden, honey...

44:06.382 --> 44:08.471
It's not too late
to turn back.

44:08.471 --> 44:11.692
- You're my daughter now.

44:11.692 --> 44:14.216
Do you think this is
how you should behave?

44:16.610 --> 44:17.611
God damn!

44:17.611 --> 44:19.395
Any more questions?

44:20.745 --> 44:22.007
I didn't think so.

44:25.053 --> 44:26.881
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

44:37.152 --> 44:41.200
This is insanity.
This is completely insane.

44:41.200 --> 44:43.506
Did you see what it was like
out there?

44:43.506 --> 44:45.421
All the dead bodies.

44:45.421 --> 44:46.727
I don't know
where my parents are.

44:46.727 --> 44:48.250
I don't know
what happened to them.

44:48.250 --> 44:50.209
Let's tear this place
to the ground!

44:50.209 --> 44:53.908
My phone.
My phone doesn't work.

44:53.908 --> 44:55.431
Mine either.

44:55.431 --> 44:57.172
Could these little freaks
have done something

44:57.172 --> 44:58.260
to the cell tower?

44:58.260 --> 45:00.045
Jesus.

45:00.045 --> 45:02.569
My brother is with them now.

45:05.572 --> 45:07.008
Rip 'em up!

45:07.008 --> 45:08.836
Bo. Bo.

45:10.359 --> 45:11.926
Do something.

45:13.014 --> 45:14.712
Help us if you can.

45:18.890 --> 45:20.152
Hit 'em!

45:20.152 --> 45:22.894
We have to. We...

45:22.894 --> 45:25.157
We can do something.

45:26.114 --> 45:28.856
Look at this!

45:28.856 --> 45:30.075
Yes, Bo.

45:31.250 --> 45:34.819
You're right.
We have to stop this.

45:39.824 --> 45:41.608
- Aaaah!
- No!

45:51.879 --> 45:53.925
My God.

46:08.374 --> 46:09.810
Eden.

46:09.810 --> 46:13.118
Jesus Christ. What is it
you intend to do here?

46:15.685 --> 46:17.383
Well...

46:23.171 --> 46:25.739
If you really want to know.

46:26.914 --> 46:30.831
I hope you can hold your breath
better than Timmy Cain,

46:30.831 --> 46:33.878
Ava Foster, Boyd Bowden,

46:33.878 --> 46:36.576
or any of my other
delinquent friends.

46:41.363 --> 46:43.235
No!

46:45.977 --> 46:47.195
It's halothane!

46:48.893 --> 46:50.459
Cover your mouths!

46:50.459 --> 46:53.462
Eden, no!

46:54.899 --> 46:56.248
Eden!

46:57.640 --> 47:00.643
This is for my friends.
How does it feel?

47:02.820 --> 47:03.821
How do you like it?

48:01.182 --> 48:03.054
Heya, Sheriff Gebler.

48:14.804 --> 48:15.936
Mom?

48:22.987 --> 48:28.818
What in God's name
do you think you're doing?

48:28.818 --> 48:30.995
Rendering the verdict.

48:30.995 --> 48:33.519
You just wait till I get
my hands on you.

48:33.519 --> 48:34.694
You little, bitch.

48:34.694 --> 48:36.914
Oh! Really?

48:36.914 --> 48:38.567
You want to mess with me?

48:38.567 --> 48:41.179
Yeah. Okay, fine.
Yeah. Let's play.

48:41.179 --> 48:43.833
Steve! Joe!
Let's go!

48:43.833 --> 48:45.444
Eden.

48:45.444 --> 48:47.489
- Eden, no, please.
- You don't have to do this.

48:59.501 --> 49:01.503
No!
You can't do this!

49:03.984 --> 49:05.464
Eden. Eden!

49:05.464 --> 49:06.987
Let us out!

49:12.732 --> 49:13.820
Stop!

49:19.913 --> 49:20.958
Bo, no!

49:20.958 --> 49:24.135
Mom!

49:30.750 --> 49:32.012
No!

49:36.625 --> 49:38.105
What are you doing?!

49:39.672 --> 49:41.543
No, no!

49:41.543 --> 49:42.631
Stop!

49:48.768 --> 49:50.770
No, don't do it!

49:50.770 --> 49:53.077
Stop! No!

49:53.077 --> 49:54.208
No!

50:05.176 --> 50:08.005
Mom! Mom!

50:54.877 --> 50:56.053
Cecil.

51:17.813 --> 51:19.337
Feed.

51:31.262 --> 51:33.046
Mom.

51:36.354 --> 51:38.095
I am sorry.

52:14.392 --> 52:16.307
My dad was right.

52:18.570 --> 52:20.789
He warned me
if I tried to fix this

52:20.789 --> 52:22.487
I'd only make it worse.

52:24.315 --> 52:26.534
So get out if you can.

52:27.883 --> 52:29.407
Save yourselves.

52:33.933 --> 52:37.676
But my dad is still alive.

52:37.676 --> 52:40.592
So I'm gonna stay

52:40.592 --> 52:44.552
and stop Eden
from killing him too.

52:44.552 --> 52:46.250
Yeah.

52:46.250 --> 52:47.990
Okay.

52:47.990 --> 52:50.515
Okay, Bo.

52:50.515 --> 52:53.474
Well, go to Candlestick.

52:53.474 --> 52:55.476
And get help.

53:54.100 --> 53:55.319
Hi, Bo.

53:57.321 --> 54:00.106
Eden, you can't.

54:00.106 --> 54:02.500
You cannot do this.

54:05.416 --> 54:10.116
They kill
everything they touch.

54:11.639 --> 54:15.426
Putting them on trial
was your idea.

54:15.426 --> 54:17.341
What did you think
would happen?

54:19.647 --> 54:22.171
Not this.

54:23.695 --> 54:26.132
It's us against them.

54:26.132 --> 54:28.003
Whose side are you on?

54:36.490 --> 54:39.711
What are you gonna do
with my father and the others?

54:39.711 --> 54:42.627
I'm gonna send them out
to the corn, Bo.

54:45.673 --> 54:50.069
He's sick.
He needs to feed.

54:50.635 --> 54:52.071
He?

54:52.071 --> 54:54.769
He Who Walks.

54:57.946 --> 54:59.644
That week I was out there...

55:01.994 --> 55:05.389
...wandering alone
in the corn...

55:06.477 --> 55:07.695
...he talked to me.

55:07.695 --> 55:11.743
He took care of me.

55:15.747 --> 55:19.141
No adult in Rylstone
ever did that for me.

55:20.969 --> 55:24.059
So now I'm going to
take care of him.

55:27.411 --> 55:30.718
By killing all the adults?

55:32.416 --> 55:34.679
For starters.

55:34.679 --> 55:38.335
They ate the seed-corn, Bo.

55:38.335 --> 55:40.337
Now it's time
to pay the price.

55:42.643 --> 55:44.384
If one of us can just
get out of here,

55:44.384 --> 55:46.343
make it to Candlestick,
we can get help, all right?

55:46.343 --> 55:48.823
Check this out!

55:49.998 --> 55:51.739
This is insanity.
- Dad, I need you to trust me.

55:51.739 --> 55:53.393
Right now, they want to know
who's side I'm on,

55:53.393 --> 55:55.700
so I need you to do
exactly what I say.

55:55.700 --> 55:59.268
Listen, they want to take you
all out into the corn.

55:59.268 --> 56:00.748
- What? What for?
- Go! Go!

56:00.748 --> 56:02.707
You'll be safe.
You can get help.

56:10.845 --> 56:15.415
If that creature wants us
to go into the corn,

56:15.415 --> 56:19.985
then we should be doing
the exact opposite!

56:19.985 --> 56:21.726
I wouldn't worry about it.

56:21.726 --> 56:25.599
You were never going
into the corn anyway.

56:25.599 --> 56:27.427
Because <i>you</i>
stood up for it.

56:27.427 --> 56:29.821
Yes.
That's right, Eden.

56:29.821 --> 56:32.432
I never had a thing to do
with killing the corn.

56:32.432 --> 56:36.131
In fact, I-I spoke out strongly
against it!

56:36.131 --> 56:39.700
Eden, remember that thing that
happened in the foster home?

56:39.700 --> 56:43.617
Ohh.
Who took you in, hmm?

56:46.925 --> 56:49.797
It was you, Pastor.
You did.

56:49.797 --> 56:52.583
You took me in.

56:52.583 --> 56:55.934
You never sinned against
the corn like all the rest.

57:05.422 --> 57:07.728
But, come on, Pastor.

57:07.728 --> 57:09.600
You did sin.

57:09.600 --> 57:10.992
Didn't you?

57:16.998 --> 57:20.175
- Enough!
- Shut up.

57:20.175 --> 57:22.308
No!

57:25.137 --> 57:28.140
No, Eden!
No, please, no!

57:28.140 --> 57:29.533
No, Eden, no!

57:29.533 --> 57:33.928
No, no, no, no!

57:33.928 --> 57:36.322
No, Eden, no!

57:37.454 --> 57:39.499
God!
Oh, God, no!

57:39.499 --> 57:40.631
- Please!

57:40.631 --> 57:43.024
No, Eden!

57:47.202 --> 57:49.204
No, no!

57:50.336 --> 57:54.558
God, no, no!

58:02.696 --> 58:04.437
Oh, Eden...

58:29.897 --> 58:31.508
Bo, where is she?

58:31.508 --> 58:33.074
Please, don't ask me that.
Don't ask me about Mom.

58:33.074 --> 58:34.336
I need to know
where my wife is!

58:34.336 --> 58:35.599
Stop!

58:35.599 --> 58:37.470
Listen, you need to go
out to the corn.

58:37.470 --> 58:39.603
That's it.
This is our chance to get help.

58:39.603 --> 58:41.561
Okay?
This is it.

58:44.390 --> 58:46.000
Okay.
I'll go.

58:47.088 --> 58:49.830
But you fight.
All right?

58:49.830 --> 58:50.918
Yes.

58:50.918 --> 58:52.398
I love you.

58:54.748 --> 58:56.097
I love you too.

59:04.192 --> 59:06.455
You did good.

59:06.455 --> 59:08.022
He'll feed well tonight.

59:09.371 --> 59:10.459
Drop it, Cam.

59:12.287 --> 59:14.420
She's not a threat.

59:23.516 --> 59:25.605
Okay, Dad.

59:25.605 --> 59:27.607
I will.

59:27.607 --> 59:29.391
I will fight.

59:53.677 --> 59:55.635
And guess what else.

59:55.635 --> 59:59.726
From now on, no one in Rylstone
and no one out!

59:59.726 --> 1:00:01.728
And if anyone cares
to stop here,

1:00:01.728 --> 1:00:03.208
guess what we're gonna do.

1:00:03.208 --> 1:00:05.645
Take them!
Take them into the corn!

1:00:05.645 --> 1:00:08.169
That's right.
Get them into the corn.

1:00:08.169 --> 1:00:09.954
Because we don't need
a single thing

1:00:09.954 --> 1:00:11.608
they have to offer!

1:00:11.608 --> 1:00:15.002
Everything we've ever needed
is right here,

1:00:15.002 --> 1:00:17.265
right out there
in those fields.

1:00:17.265 --> 1:00:21.661
The corn, the earth, will take
care of its children.

1:00:21.661 --> 1:00:24.751
This is our world now,
and we're gonna run it

1:00:24.751 --> 1:00:27.188
the way we want for a change.

1:00:27.188 --> 1:00:28.581
And we're gonna run it right!

1:00:28.581 --> 1:00:29.887
Right!

1:00:29.887 --> 1:00:32.541
And isn't
just gonna be Rylstone either.

1:00:32.541 --> 1:00:35.109
We're gonna spread the word
all across this country.

1:00:35.109 --> 1:00:37.416
You think there aren't
others like us?

1:00:37.416 --> 1:00:41.681
Kids seeing their world and
future just being traded away?

1:00:41.681 --> 1:00:43.465
Well, they're gonna take
their towns, too,

1:00:43.465 --> 1:00:45.685
and make this whole world
right again!

1:00:45.685 --> 1:00:51.952
- Right!
- Right!

1:00:56.478 --> 1:00:57.741
Like this thing.

1:01:03.834 --> 1:01:08.360
It was going to use us,
was going to sell our future.

1:01:08.360 --> 1:01:11.189
So we should cut her head off,
right, Bo?

1:01:11.189 --> 1:01:12.407
No!

1:01:16.107 --> 1:01:17.717
I mean, yes.

1:01:17.717 --> 1:01:18.849
Yes.

1:01:20.502 --> 1:01:21.721
She sinned.

1:01:21.721 --> 1:01:25.029
She sinned against you.

1:01:25.029 --> 1:01:27.074
Against all of us.

1:01:29.642 --> 1:01:34.168
And that's why we shouldn't
waste her blood here.

1:01:35.300 --> 1:01:40.218
Not when I can send her
into the corn.

1:01:41.262 --> 1:01:43.351
That's a pretty good idea, Bo.

1:02:24.392 --> 1:02:26.090
But, Bo...

1:02:30.834 --> 1:02:35.752
An even better idea would be
to take her straight to him.

1:02:43.368 --> 1:02:45.065
This way.

1:05:16.825 --> 1:05:18.175
That's it.

1:05:21.091 --> 1:05:22.135
Take her up.

1:05:42.939 --> 1:05:44.592
Doors.

1:05:55.647 --> 1:05:57.301
He Who Walks!

1:05:59.216 --> 1:06:00.347
Come!

1:06:01.609 --> 1:06:03.481
Come to us!

1:06:35.861 --> 1:06:38.168
Eden.

1:06:38.168 --> 1:06:40.779
He Who Walks,

1:06:40.779 --> 1:06:43.956
he doesn't exist.

1:06:43.956 --> 1:06:46.524
Don't you dare say that!

1:07:05.847 --> 1:07:06.979
Stay back.

1:08:07.866 --> 1:08:09.998
It can't be real.

1:08:39.506 --> 1:08:40.768
Aah!

1:08:51.170 --> 1:08:54.913
Help me!

1:08:59.613 --> 1:09:01.615
You can't hurt me, Bo.

1:09:31.210 --> 1:09:33.821
God, you idiots!
You're goddamn little idiots!

1:09:33.821 --> 1:09:35.345
Brace yourself.

1:09:35.997 --> 1:09:39.131
Are you--
Are you crazy?!

1:09:41.220 --> 1:09:43.483
Grain dust.

1:09:43.483 --> 1:09:44.789
Remember?

1:09:44.789 --> 1:09:47.270
This place is full of it.

1:09:47.270 --> 1:09:51.622
You light a fire, this whole
place will blow sky high.

1:09:51.622 --> 1:09:56.975
The corn
and everything in it

1:09:56.975 --> 1:09:58.629
will burn.

1:10:08.769 --> 1:10:09.901
Fine.

1:10:12.773 --> 1:10:14.340
Let's chop her up.

1:10:18.692 --> 1:10:20.607
Go on.
Get her.

1:10:40.975 --> 1:10:43.021
Come on!

1:10:43.021 --> 1:10:44.544
Let's go!

1:10:44.544 --> 1:10:46.416
Into the corn!

1:10:53.161 --> 1:10:54.293
Come on!

1:11:02.910 --> 1:11:04.999
Come on!

1:11:52.003 --> 1:11:53.483
Dad.

1:11:53.483 --> 1:11:55.398
I'm so sorry.

1:12:23.121 --> 1:12:25.341
Help me.

1:15:15.685 --> 1:15:18.165
Car! Yes!

1:15:24.258 --> 1:15:25.869
Keys, keys, keys.

1:17:01.007 --> 1:17:02.922
Fuck that shit.

1:17:15.239 --> 1:17:16.414
No. No.

1:17:25.466 --> 1:17:27.338
No, no, no, no.

1:17:37.827 --> 1:17:40.003
Oh, thank you.
Oh, thank God.

1:17:42.875 --> 1:17:44.442
- Hi, Bo.

1:17:47.314 --> 1:17:48.664
Eden.

1:17:50.753 --> 1:17:52.929
Eden, Eden.

1:17:54.234 --> 1:17:55.496
Jesus.

1:17:58.021 --> 1:17:59.370
T-This...

1:18:01.328 --> 1:18:04.462
This is madness.

1:18:04.462 --> 1:18:07.291
Craziness, insanity.

1:18:10.686 --> 1:18:11.948
You know?

1:18:13.993 --> 1:18:16.953
Yeah.
It's pretty crazy.

1:18:16.953 --> 1:18:18.345
I'll give you that.

1:18:33.709 --> 1:18:35.449
What is that, Eden?

1:18:40.803 --> 1:18:42.065
Oh.

1:18:43.370 --> 1:18:44.589
This.

1:18:46.591 --> 1:18:48.201
Depositive bolt, Bo.

1:18:49.028 --> 1:18:51.248
You know, a cattle gun.

1:18:53.337 --> 1:18:55.078
I know what you're thinking.

1:18:57.080 --> 1:18:59.343
Forget it.

1:18:59.343 --> 1:19:01.780
You know I'm not the only one
out here.

1:19:21.931 --> 1:19:23.933
It's past my bedtime.

1:19:25.630 --> 1:19:26.762
Let's go.

1:19:29.025 --> 1:19:31.070
A l-last cigarette at least?

1:19:32.985 --> 1:19:34.247
You smoke?

1:19:38.295 --> 1:19:40.427
Bad habit. I...

1:19:41.907 --> 1:19:44.518
...was about to quit.

1:20:38.137 --> 1:20:39.660
Come on.

1:20:53.109 --> 1:20:54.850
Get down on your knees.

1:21:16.784 --> 1:21:18.699
Don't be scared, Bo.

1:21:20.788 --> 1:21:22.573
Hey, Eden?

1:21:24.880 --> 1:21:26.707
You really think

1:21:26.707 --> 1:21:31.147
the second you soaked me
in all that tractor fuel,

1:21:31.147 --> 1:21:33.889
that I wasn't
gonna make sure

1:21:33.889 --> 1:21:36.935
I ended up right...

1:21:42.375 --> 1:21:43.681
...here?

1:21:51.297 --> 1:21:52.864
Burn.

1:22:31.120 --> 1:22:32.382
No.

1:22:51.140 --> 1:22:53.446
No, no, no!

1:23:19.211 --> 1:23:23.520
Candlestick and everyone else
for miles around

1:23:23.520 --> 1:23:25.000
will be here soon.

1:23:26.175 --> 1:23:29.352
Face it.

1:23:29.352 --> 1:23:31.615
It's done.

1:23:51.417 --> 1:23:54.203
Your fantasy's finished, Eden.

1:24:37.289 --> 1:24:38.595
I'm sorry.

1:24:44.992 --> 1:24:46.646
Eden.

1:26:41.108 --> 1:26:42.632
Don't worry, Bo.

1:26:44.111 --> 1:26:46.505
Nothing ever really dies
in the corn.
