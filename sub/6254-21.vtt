with lunatics.

That’s around the time
Dr. Brennan said Rebecca
was hit in the face.

20:39.406 --> 20:44.070
Right. Now, look at
the admitting doctor’s note
for cause of injury.

20:44.160 --> 20:45.661
[ Sweets ]
“Accidental fall in home.”

20:45.745 --> 20:47.736
So here’s where
Mr. Shrinky comes into play.

20:47.872 --> 20:51.490
lf Gordon Rand attacked her,
why didn’t Rebecca report him?
Uh, fear?

20:51.584 --> 20:53.540
She probably thought that
by reporting him,

20:53.628 --> 20:55.914
she would incite him
and make matters worse.

20:56.005 --> 20:58.997
She had a restraining order.
One call, and the cops would
have picked him up.

20:59.092 --> 21:00.582
Yeah, but she knew
the justice system.

21:00.677 --> 21:03.965
She knew that it didn’t always work.
So her survival skills kicked in.

21:04.055 --> 21:06.671
Was there any additional contact
after this, uh, incident?

21:06.766 --> 21:09.803
Yeah. He sent her these
a week before she disappeared.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.515
That’s... creepy.

21:19.696 --> 21:23.188
So, what can you tell me
about Rebecca Pearce?

21:23.283 --> 21:26.275
Uh, nothing to tell.
Things got complicated,
so I broke it off.

21:26.369 --> 21:29.532
Did they get complicated around
the time that you started making
naked videos of her?

21:29.664 --> 21:32.576
She was totally into it, man.
She was playing to the camera.
You’re delusional.

21:32.667 --> 21:34.703
You know what?
You are a stalker.

21:36.671 --> 21:38.878
You delude yourself into thinking
that there’s a real relationship.

21:38.965 --> 21:40.421
No.

21:40.508 --> 21:43.796
Then it finally sinks in after hundreds
of phone calls and letters.

21:43.887 --> 21:47.846
Romance is a dance—
You move forward,
they move back and vice versa.

21:47.932 --> 21:49.433
A dance? Really? Okay.

21:49.517 --> 21:51.929
Give me one example when she
moved forward to you, just once.

21:52.896 --> 21:54.352
It’s a— It’s a subtle thing, man.

21:54.481 --> 21:58.440
What are these?
Love tokens?
Yeah.

21:58.526 --> 22:00.562
She liked
the Halloween movies.

22:02.989 --> 22:05.480
It was on her profile.
So if you guys were
so right for each other,

22:05.575 --> 22:07.657
why’d she take out
a restraining order
against you?

22:07.744 --> 22:10.235
Well, all respect to Rebecca,
that’s when she took it too far.

22:10.330 --> 22:11.786
And then you smacked her
in the face.

22:11.873 --> 22:13.454
I would never do that.
I loved her.

22:13.541 --> 22:15.623
And I followed every rule
of that order.

22:15.752 --> 22:20.041
Where were you
on the 17th?
l was at—at home, I think.

22:20.131 --> 22:22.417
You think?
Do you have someone who
can back up your story?

22:24.469 --> 22:26.005
My mom.
Your mom?

22:26.095 --> 22:30.088
You live with your mom?
I bet Rebecca
found that hot.

22:35.396 --> 22:38.183
I need your help with something,
but it must remain between us.

22:38.274 --> 22:39.889
Yeah. For you, anything.

22:39.984 --> 22:43.602
Christine has been accused
of something based on
the word of a two—year-old...

22:43.696 --> 22:45.812
whose neural connections
haven’t fully formed yet.

22:45.907 --> 22:48.114
I heard.
She bit a kid.

22:48.201 --> 22:51.910
No— Allegedly.
A child was bitten, but—
[ Scoffs ]

22:51.996 --> 22:54.328
there’s no definitive evidence
that it was Christine.

22:54.415 --> 22:57.873
You don’t accuse anyone,
even a child, without proof—

22:57.961 --> 23:00.919
photographs or measurement
of the alleged bite mark.

23:01.005 --> 23:02.996
What do you need?

23:03.091 --> 23:05.332
I need you to access some records
from Christine’s day care.

23:06.386 --> 23:08.047
You want me
to hack their server?

23:08.137 --> 23:09.752
I need you to pull
Emma Carter’s records...

23:09.847 --> 23:12.463
and see if there’s
any visual evidence
of the alleged bite.

23:12.559 --> 23:14.390
You know this is
pretty extreme, right?

23:14.477 --> 23:17.264
Motherhood makes demands
that you can’t ignore.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.808
[Sighs]

23:21.693 --> 23:25.026
Did you identify
the fiber particulate
I found under the victim’s nail?

23:25.113 --> 23:28.526
Copolymer of a BC diamine
and a 12C diacid.

23:28.616 --> 23:30.777
Copolymer?
It’s a synthetic fabric?

23:30.868 --> 23:33.029
Nylon—based velvet
treated with purple dye.

23:33.162 --> 23:35.653
l’ve e-mailed you
the results.
Okay.

23:37.166 --> 23:38.622
[ Saroyan ]
Did you find something?

23:38.710 --> 23:40.496
When I was examining the feet,
lnoﬂced,uh,

23:40.587 --> 23:46.503
perimortem hairline fractures
to the talus, calcaneus
and distal fibula.

23:46.593 --> 23:49.926
Could that result
from the victim
kicking her assailant?

23:50.013 --> 23:54.052
Well, that’s more consistent
with damage by a jump down
onto a hard surface.

23:54.142 --> 23:57.760
But in that case,
we would expect to see
the tibias and fibulas...

23:57.854 --> 24:00.186
pierce directly through
the inferior portion of the feet.

24:00.273 --> 24:04.232
And there are no
compression fractures
to the lumbar vertebrae.

24:04.319 --> 24:07.061
So a jump, but not
from a great height.

24:07.155 --> 24:10.192
Well, maybe she was dropped
from the top of the stairs
to the cellar floor.

24:10.283 --> 24:14.447
Now, that’s a distance
of approximately 10 feet
orjust over three meters.

24:14.537 --> 24:17.574
So not high enough
to kill her, but it sure
would’ve slowed her down.

24:17.665 --> 24:19.326
Yeah.

24:25.548 --> 24:30.292
/ find for the plaintiff
in the full amount of $243.

24:32.430 --> 24:35.422
— You said /’d win, bitch!
— Why didn’t you arrest this man?

24:35.516 --> 24:38.804
Well, because he was in county
on a solicitation charge
the night of the murder.

24:38.895 --> 24:39.884
[ Griff]
All rise.

24:42.899 --> 24:45.185
[ Booth ]
Oh, wow.

24:45.276 --> 24:47.688
Weebles, wobbles and— Ow!
[Audience Snickering /

24:47.779 --> 24:49.815
Wow. Okay, so what
do you think, Bones?

24:49.906 --> 24:52.864
The judge might suffer
from a neuromuscular
disorder.

24:54.077 --> 24:56.568
She’s sloshed!
Drunk.

24:57.705 --> 24:58.945
Oh, that.

24:59.082 --> 25:01.619
Yes.
Who ’s talking in my courtroom .7

25:01.751 --> 25:03.616
[ Booth ]
Oh!
[Audience Laughs /

25:03.711 --> 25:06.703
From the looks of it,
she is a mean drunk.

25:12.679 --> 25:16.137
Who ’s talking
in my courtroom .7

25:16.224 --> 25:18.681
Okay, that definitely looks like
felony assault to me.

25:18.768 --> 25:22.602
[ Scoffs ]
You don’t have a good grasp of
the law, do you, Agent Booth?

25:22.689 --> 25:25.180
Since no charges were filed,
legally, that looks like nothing at all.

25:25.316 --> 25:26.817
Wow.
Ah, pretty cold.

25:26.901 --> 25:30.189
Yeah, I get that way
when I’m falsely
accused of assault.

25:30.279 --> 25:33.112
Rebecca knew it was an accident
and signed documents
to confirm that.

25:33.199 --> 25:34.700
The way you stumbled
and missed the steps—

25:34.784 --> 25:36.240
You had been drinking there,
hadn’t you?

25:36.327 --> 25:40.491
[ Scoffs ]
I had come back from
a business lunch,

25:40.581 --> 25:42.867
probably had some wine.

25:42.959 --> 25:45.496
This line of questioning
is absurd.

25:45.586 --> 25:49.875
— Move on with it.
- This is not your fake
courtroom, Trudy.

25:49.966 --> 25:53.083
I call the shots here.
You’re more than
a social drinker, aren’t you?

25:53.177 --> 25:55.463
I can tell by the way
your hand is shaking.

25:58.099 --> 26:01.466
l have an occasional drink.
Occasional.
Right.

26:02.645 --> 26:05.102
Like you had
the occasional D.U.l.

26:05.189 --> 26:07.646
For me, it was gambling.
For my father,
it was drinking.

26:07.734 --> 26:09.850
I know a problem
when I see one.

26:15.074 --> 26:17.531
[ Chuckles ]

26:17.618 --> 26:21.611
The Trudy you see on TV—
that’s a performance.

26:21.706 --> 26:23.571
Some days I need help
getting there.

26:23.666 --> 26:25.577
Okay. So it must have been
difficult, then,

26:25.668 --> 26:27.374
when Rebecca banned alcohol
from the set.

26:27.462 --> 26:30.078
Nothing was banned
from the set.

26:30.173 --> 26:31.754
According to
this production letter,

26:31.841 --> 26:34.332
you would’ve lost
the insurance on your show
if you didn’t stop drinking.

26:34.427 --> 26:37.965
- But you’re still drinking.
— Addiction is tough, even
when your career is at stake.

26:38.055 --> 26:40.762
Yourjudgment’s impaired,
you make impulsive
and rash decisions.

26:40.850 --> 26:44.638
Like getting rid of the people
standing between you
and that drink that you need.

26:45.730 --> 26:47.311
I didn’t kill Rebecca.

26:47.398 --> 26:49.605
But you did find someone to
bring your booze to the set, right?

26:49.692 --> 26:53.025
Maybe someone
to get on your good side,
edge out Rebecca.

26:53.112 --> 26:56.775
[ Scoffs ]
I’m not answering
any more questions.

26:56.866 --> 26:59.858
And that’s your right.
But can you see
the headlines now?

26:59.952 --> 27:02.614
“TV’s Judge Trudy Obstructs
Murder Investigation.”

27:02.705 --> 27:05.447
Now, that is bad publicity.

27:12.381 --> 27:14.337
So, these are from
the little girl’s file.

27:14.467 --> 27:16.753
You can see the bite marks.
Excellent.

27:16.844 --> 27:20.086
Now we can
discount the validity
of their allegations,

27:20.181 --> 27:23.969
and I will be able
to submit evidence
to Christine’s day care director.

27:24.894 --> 27:26.475
Here.
What is this?

27:26.562 --> 27:29.599
We’ll need to
compare the injuries
with Christine.

27:29.690 --> 27:33.353
You actually
took an impression
of Christine’s teeth?

27:33.444 --> 27:37.528
Yes. l—l had her
bite into an apple, and then
I constructed the model.

27:37.615 --> 27:39.731
It was actually
quite simple.

27:39.826 --> 27:42.283
- And she loves apples.
- Okay.

27:56.342 --> 27:59.084
[ Brennan ]
Oh. Aha. There is
a laceration here,

27:59.178 --> 28:01.920
in the area where Christine’s tooth
hasn’t yet fully erupted.

28:02.014 --> 28:03.845
Do you concur?

28:03.933 --> 28:06.345
Uh, well, since
the flesh is malleable,

28:06.435 --> 28:09.472
the computer can’t confirm or deny
if Christine did this.

28:09.564 --> 28:13.148
Well, that is absurd.
We can re—create
entire crime scenes,

28:13.276 --> 28:15.813
complete assault
scenarios.
Sorry, sweetie.

28:15.903 --> 28:18.440
The best that I can do
is give you odds.

28:20.032 --> 28:21.533
Okay.

28:21.617 --> 28:23.118
And you’re not
gonna like them.

28:23.202 --> 28:25.363
Why?
What do you mean?

28:25.454 --> 28:29.743
Odds are 78 to 21 that
Christine bit the kid.

28:29.834 --> 28:32.951
Twenty—one percent
plus my knowledge of her.

28:33.045 --> 28:36.708
I am satisfied that
Christine is innocent.

28:36.799 --> 28:40.257
- Really?
— Of course. Thank you.

28:40.344 --> 28:44.053
Oh, are we still on for
Christine and Michael Vincent’s
playdate on Saturday?

28:44.140 --> 28:46.506
Uh, sure, yeah.

28:46.601 --> 28:48.091
Great.

28:58.487 --> 29:01.695
I hope this is important.
I’m trying to find
cause of death.

29:01.824 --> 29:05.658
What’s that smell?
It is catfish, Opie.

29:06.913 --> 29:09.905
Oh. That wasn’t necessary,
Thurston.

29:09.999 --> 29:12.706
But it was.
Come here, sit down.

29:15.922 --> 29:20.006
And this?
This is the hot sauce.

29:21.427 --> 29:23.509
Taste it.
You are gonna love it.

29:25.389 --> 29:28.301
Uh, this is—
[Sighs]

29:34.482 --> 29:36.768
Oh, my God.

29:36.859 --> 29:39.646
- How did you do that?
- Aframomum me/egueta.

29:39.737 --> 29:41.693
It’s more commonly known
as Guinea grain.

29:41.781 --> 29:45.114
lt’s native to
swampy habitats along
the West African coast.

29:45.201 --> 29:47.192
l have no idea
how your granny
got ahold of it, but—

29:47.286 --> 29:48.992
She used to trade with
an herbalist in the woods.

29:49.080 --> 29:52.948
Damn, if you haven’t brought
my granny back from the dead!
[Laughs]

29:53.042 --> 29:54.828
Hey, I told you
I’d find it, right?

29:54.919 --> 29:57.752
And you were right.
The secret ingredient was love.

29:57.838 --> 30:00.966
That’s the only explanation
for Hodgins spending
so much time and—

30:01.050 --> 30:02.540
and effort to do this.

30:05.680 --> 30:07.136
Eat. Go. Eat.

30:07.223 --> 30:09.305
Eat.

30:09.392 --> 30:11.053
Hey, we shouldn’t keep
this stuff a secret.

30:11.143 --> 30:14.601
— I mean, the world would love this.
— Oh, very true, very true.

30:14.730 --> 30:18.939
You should slow down a little bit, Finn.
You don’t want to get a bone
stuck in your throat.

30:19.026 --> 30:20.937
Not from a baby catfish.

30:24.657 --> 30:25.897
— That’s it.
— What?

30:25.992 --> 30:28.153
Cause of death.

30:28.244 --> 30:30.360
Th—Thank you.

30:35.543 --> 30:38.580
You see these micro—fractures
on the transverse processes
of the C4 and 5?

30:38.713 --> 30:41.921
Yes.
Well, they appear to be
consistent with strangulation.

30:42.008 --> 30:45.000
Which is unlikely since
the hyoid bone
remains intact.

30:45.094 --> 30:47.050
Unlikely, yes,
but not impossible.

30:47.138 --> 30:49.299
The victim was
in her mid—20s, yes?

30:49.390 --> 30:52.553
At that age, the hyoid bone
is still very flexible.

30:52.643 --> 30:55.885
If the conditions were right,
she could’ve been strangled
without breaking her hyoid.

30:55.980 --> 30:59.939
The flexibility of the young,
semi—cartilaginous hyoid,

31:00.026 --> 31:04.861
combined with a wide ligature,
could very well have caused
these micro—fractures.

31:04.947 --> 31:06.403
Well done,
Mr. Abernathy.

31:06.490 --> 31:09.448
Well, you should be
thanking my granny.
[ Chuckles ]

31:12.872 --> 31:15.705
Rebecca made it clear
if there was any booze
on set, I’d be fired.

31:15.791 --> 31:18.282
Then Trudy said
if I didn’t figure out a way
to get her some vodka,

31:18.419 --> 31:20.876
she’d fire me too.
So you picked the judge.

31:20.963 --> 31:24.956
It was just a matter of time
before Trudy fired Rebecca.
This job meant a lot to me.

31:25.051 --> 31:28.464
I’d say it worked out
pretty well for you.
The show is still going on.

31:28.554 --> 31:30.761
You got Rebecca’s job.
Sounds like a motive to me.

31:30.890 --> 31:33.256
Rebecca was my mentor.
Oh, right, yeah.

31:33.350 --> 31:37.389
She treated you like crap.
You got paid next to nothing,
and she took all the credit.

31:37.480 --> 31:39.061
That’s how everyone
starts out.

31:39.148 --> 31:41.059
Trudy said that you and Rebecca
used to fight all the time...

31:41.150 --> 31:42.936
because she wouldn’t
give you a promotion.

31:44.653 --> 31:46.609
Sometimes
I have a temper.

31:46.739 --> 31:50.823
I can... get impatient.
That’s all.
I think you ran out of patience.

31:50.910 --> 31:54.118
I think you told her
to go to this abandoned building
to interview this fake guest,

31:54.205 --> 31:57.038
and... you strangled her
with this.

31:58.542 --> 32:00.749
Where—
Where did you get this?

32:00.836 --> 32:02.212
Got a search warrant
for your apartment.

32:02.296 --> 32:05.083
The team at
the Jeffersonian said that
Rebecca was strangled.

32:05.216 --> 32:07.878
We found a fiber
underneath her fingernail.
No.

32:07.968 --> 32:09.378
No, you—you’ve got this
all wrong.

32:09.512 --> 32:11.844
Rebecca lent me this scarf.
That’s—
Oh.

32:11.931 --> 32:14.422
That’s Rebecca’s scarf.

32:14.517 --> 32:16.098
Oh, I didn’t know that.
Thanks for that.

32:16.185 --> 32:19.803
Wow, this is looking
worse and worse for you,
isn’t it, Jill?

32:29.073 --> 32:31.189
[ Booth ]
Look, Jill Roberts
has motive and opportunity.

32:31.283 --> 32:33.945
Hell, she even
got her promotion
courtesy of Rebecca’s death.

32:34.036 --> 32:37.745
I believe our killer
acted on impulse
and obsession.

32:37.873 --> 32:40.740
Jill Roberts is methodical
and calculating.
Okay.

32:40.835 --> 32:43.918
You’re saying that she’s innocent
because her desk is neat?

32:44.004 --> 32:47.747
No, I’m saying that Jill is only
aggressive professionally.

32:47.842 --> 32:49.548
She didn’t try to hide
her feelings.

32:49.635 --> 32:51.546
She seemed genuinely upset
about Rebecca’s death.

32:51.637 --> 32:54.754
Hodgins identified
the fiber that was under
the victim’s fingernails.

32:54.849 --> 32:58.558
Some kind of a nylon, okay?
This scarf probably matches it.

32:59.562 --> 33:01.052
No, see, this is wool.

33:01.147 --> 33:03.559
This is South American vicuna.
It’s very expensive.

33:03.691 --> 33:06.524
What?
It’s not a crime to
appreciate nice things.

33:07.945 --> 33:10.311
Okay. Doesn’t mean that
she’s not the murderer, okay?

33:10.406 --> 33:12.067
It just means that
she didn’t use this.

33:13.826 --> 33:15.782
I think you’re reaching,
Booth.

33:20.708 --> 33:23.825
[ Brennan] Our assumption was
that the victim was strangled
at the top of the stairs...

33:23.919 --> 33:25.500
and then tossed over the railing.

33:25.588 --> 33:28.295
But Finn and I tried that
every possible way.

33:28.382 --> 33:32.842
The yellow fractures
show the injuries
from the simulated falls,

33:32.928 --> 33:36.591
and the red show
the actual fractures
to your victim.

33:36.682 --> 33:38.889
[Finn ] We couldn’t match
the same fracture pattern
that we found.

33:38.976 --> 33:41.843
What if the body dropped
at a 90—degree angle?

33:41.979 --> 33:45.016
Well, how could that be possible
if she was thrown over the side?
It wouldn’t.

33:45.107 --> 33:49.476
The calcaneal fractures
indicate that her feet
hit the ground first...

33:49.570 --> 33:51.106
and absorbed
most of the impact.

33:51.197 --> 33:53.904
So if I adjust
the direction of her body...

33:53.991 --> 33:56.107
and adjust
for the dead weight.

33:56.202 --> 33:57.658
Add a ligature
around her neck.

34:04.251 --> 34:06.537
Well, I’ll be damned.
She was hanged
over that rail.

34:06.629 --> 34:08.540
And then cut down
after she died.

34:08.631 --> 34:10.462
Hairline fracturing
matches.

34:10.549 --> 34:12.460
But the victim’s neck
wasn’t broken.

34:12.551 --> 34:14.837
Wouldn’t your neck break
if you were hanged?

34:14.929 --> 34:17.386
It depends on the length
of the ligature.

34:17.473 --> 34:19.509
And if the noose was
wide enough, like so,

34:19.600 --> 34:21.966
it wouldn’t break
Rebecca’s neck.

34:22.061 --> 34:23.597
But...

34:23.687 --> 34:27.976
it would cause
tremendous impact
to the jawline.

34:37.910 --> 34:38.899
Look.

34:38.994 --> 34:40.404
What are those?

34:40.496 --> 34:43.909
Three small nicks on
the anteroinferior aspect
of the mandible.

34:43.999 --> 34:46.706
Uniform and equidistant.
Small spikes.

34:46.794 --> 34:49.786
This could tell us
how she was strangled.
[Finn ] And by what.

34:49.880 --> 34:52.257
thave
Dr. Hodgins swab.

34:57.054 --> 35:01.138
[Angela ]
They do seem to be spikes.
Like maybe from a bracelet.

35:01.225 --> 35:03.386
Like a punk would wear.
Exactly.

35:03.477 --> 35:08.096
So you think the victim was
struck in the throat by someone
wearing a bracelet?

35:08.190 --> 35:12.149
Impossible.
There would be scraping,
as well as the indentations.

35:12.236 --> 35:14.943
These marks were made
by applying
consistent pressure.

35:15.030 --> 35:16.190
Got it!

35:16.282 --> 35:19.194
So, I swabbed
Rebecca’s mandible.
I found dander.

35:19.285 --> 35:21.526
— Dander, like from a dog?
— Yeah, exactly.

35:21.662 --> 35:23.198
It’s a dog collar.
[Hodgins]
Mm—hmm.

35:23.289 --> 35:24.904
Angie, can you call up
the file that I sent?

35:24.999 --> 35:28.082
— So, I even found the breed.
— It was a leopard hound.

35:28.168 --> 35:31.706
Yeah. lt’s a Catahoula leopard hound,
to be exact. How did you—

35:34.550 --> 35:36.256
That look familiar?

35:37.594 --> 35:39.130
What are you doing
with lris’s collar?

35:39.221 --> 35:40.631
We got a search warrant
for your home.

35:40.723 --> 35:42.964
I’m telling you.
You’ve got quite
a shrine for your dog.

35:43.058 --> 35:45.140
The purple velvet
matches perfectly...

35:45.227 --> 35:47.513
with the fibers we found
under Rebecca’s fingernails.

35:47.646 --> 35:50.479
Well, so?
She was her dog too.
[ Booth ] That’s true.

35:50.607 --> 35:54.771
So where’s lris?
She... died.

35:54.862 --> 35:57.729
— Before Rebecca was killed?
- Look, we know you had
a palimony agreement...

35:57.823 --> 36:00.064
which gave you
joint custody of the dog.

36:00.159 --> 36:01.569
How did the dog die?

36:03.579 --> 36:05.194
Rebecca was always working,

36:05.289 --> 36:08.781
so the dog that you loved
so much probably died
of neglect, am I right?

36:08.876 --> 36:14.291
There’s a tribe in Southern India
that felt that a man’s animal
was a part of him.

36:14.381 --> 36:16.246
Like his arm or his heart.

36:16.342 --> 36:18.298
If another man
killed his animal,

36:18.385 --> 36:21.502
he was put to death
in the same manner
as that animal.

36:21.597 --> 36:26.387
Our F.B.|. shrink agrees.
lris was hanged, wasn’t she?

36:26.477 --> 36:28.468
That’s why
you hanged Rebecca.

36:29.730 --> 36:31.891
We found the grave
in your backyard.

36:31.982 --> 36:37.102
We can dig up the dog,
and it’ll be easy to determine
cause of death.

36:41.325 --> 36:42.815
I’ll do that.

36:42.910 --> 36:44.741
Don’t.

36:44.828 --> 36:46.739
Don’t what?

36:49.083 --> 36:51.825
Don’t... dig up lris.

36:52.628 --> 36:54.289
Please.

36:56.465 --> 37:00.799
I went to pick her up...
one Saturday, and...

37:02.304 --> 37:05.888
nobody answered the door,
so I went around back.

37:05.974 --> 37:08.226
Rebecca was working,
like usual.

37:08.310 --> 37:11.928
Sheleﬁlns
chained to the porch.

37:13.982 --> 37:16.815
Who would leave a dog
tied up like that?

37:17.903 --> 37:19.768
I told her
that I would take her.

37:21.156 --> 37:26.276
But she said
the custody agreement
was a legal contract,

37:26.370 --> 37:28.235
that the law was the law.

37:28.330 --> 37:32.323
Everything always
went back to that
stupid show.

37:34.670 --> 37:37.787
lris was—

37:37.881 --> 37:39.837
She was more than
an agreement.

37:41.468 --> 37:44.050
She was all I had left.

37:46.598 --> 37:52.138
And there she was,
hanging off
the patio railing...

37:54.273 --> 37:56.514
dangling by her collar.

37:58.986 --> 38:03.195
Probably went after a squirrel—
[Sniffles ] or something.

38:06.660 --> 38:10.198
I couldn’t... let Rebecca
get away with that.

38:11.373 --> 38:13.785

is all about, right?

would have set up this meeting

that he is actually the best of
what this country has to offer.

Did he kill bin Laden?
Wow, you are a tough sell.

Relax, it’s just a hot sauce
we’re talking about.

39:33.789 --> 39:35.825
No, it’s not
just a hot sauce.

and tell me...

39:45.759 --> 39:48.796
that you think this is
the most amazing hot sauce
I’ll ever taste...

39:48.887 --> 39:50.798
and I should make
an exception.

39:50.889 --> 39:53.266
Ma’am, I promise you,

39:53.350 --> 39:57.719
to my everlasting surprise,
that this sauce tastes
every bit as good...

as when my grandmother
made it for me.

when it comes to settling conflicts,
it’s always better to be rational.

41:21.104 --> 41:23.971
And the abundance
of forensic evidence
against Christine...

41:24.066 --> 41:26.978
was clearly tainted
by multiple sources.

41:27.069 --> 41:30.402
Yeah, but the part where
it became the OJ. trial
was a bit much.

Yeah.
