00:01.233 --> 00:01.433
.

00:06.033 --> 00:07.600
(cheering)

00:07.667 --> 00:09.333
Hello, youse!

00:09.400 --> 00:11.667
My bitch is back in the house!

00:14.200 --> 00:16.967
It's Kyle! Fucking yay!

00:17.033 --> 00:21.233
Oh, my God. My fucking ex, Kyle,
has just walked through the
door.

00:21.300 --> 00:23.333
What the fuck is he doing with
them?

00:24.567 --> 00:27.900
I might have forgotten to
mention
Holly was in the house.

00:27.967 --> 00:31.467
Come to think of it, I did that
on purpose, and I don't give a
fuck.

00:31.533 --> 00:33.433
I lost myself in the
relationship.

00:33.500 --> 00:36.333
I lost a lot of myself in you.
Oh, my God...

00:36.400 --> 00:38.233
Aussie, Aussie, Aussie!

00:38.300 --> 00:42.567
Oh, my God! It's Alex,
my holiday romance from
Australia.

00:46.100 --> 00:48.100
Remember, you've got a clitoris.

00:49.700 --> 00:51.867
I am loving having Alex here!

00:51.933 --> 00:53.500
Sophie is so focused on him,

00:53.567 --> 00:57.000
she's forgot about butting in
on mine and Chloe's business.

01:00.267 --> 01:01.467
Is he fuck hurting me!

01:02.267 --> 01:04.900
Not only have I fucked things up
with Sophie...

01:04.967 --> 01:06.367
(shouts)

01:06.433 --> 01:09.267
...but I think the house
is turning against me.

01:09.333 --> 01:14.200
Sophie likes a man. Not a person
who gets ravioli on them!

01:14.267 --> 01:16.533
I'm happy we're cosying up
together,

01:16.600 --> 01:19.367
but I'm gonna make him wait
a little bit longer.

01:19.433 --> 01:21.233
(fart)
(groans)

01:24.433 --> 01:26.633
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

01:26.700 --> 01:28.600
I'm preened to perfection.

01:28.667 --> 01:31.467
I'm tanned, toned
and ready to tash on.

01:31.533 --> 01:34.467
I'm a lad who's got more cheek
than a girl with fillers.

01:34.533 --> 01:37.267
I can talk the back legs
off a donkey.

01:37.333 --> 01:40.300
I'm happy-go-lucky,
a Jack-the-lad. That's me to a
T.

01:40.367 --> 01:43.067
I'm fake, I'm flirty
and I've got double Fs.

01:43.133 --> 01:46.300
I don't go on the pull,
the girls just love the guns.

01:46.367 --> 01:48.900
What you see is what you get.
Bags of fun.

01:48.967 --> 01:51.833
I cannot believe anyone
would put me in charge.

01:51.900 --> 01:54.067
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:07.967 --> 02:09.866
(Sam) Look at that. Wow.

02:12.767 --> 02:15.100
(Holly) My head is fuckin'
banging.

02:15.167 --> 02:17.500
(Nathan) Last night was a lot,
wasn't it?

02:17.567 --> 02:19.100
Like, just a lot.

02:19.167 --> 02:22.633
Last night was crazy.
A proper Geordie night.

02:22.700 --> 02:26.133
(Chloe) Who's that man in my
bed?
(all) Happy birthday!

02:26.200 --> 02:28.600
Hey! It's all about me.

02:28.667 --> 02:33.800
You only turn 21 once, so I'm
gonna
be the biggest birthday diva.

02:33.867 --> 02:36.933
How you feeling, Holly?
Kyle was in this house.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.433
I know. It was strange.
(Nathan) It was weird he came
back.

02:40.500 --> 02:44.933
Seeing Kyle last night was
weird,
but it wasn't as bad as I
thought.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.367
Kyle clearly needed to speak to
me,
and maybe now he'll move on.

02:49.433 --> 02:51.733
I have nothing to be angry
about,
you know?

02:51.800 --> 02:54.300
I feel like today is all about
you,
Abbie.

02:54.367 --> 02:58.067
I'm just gonna let youse all
know
that I'm gonna be rinsing this
dry.

02:58.133 --> 03:01.800
So you should make me breakfast.
Howay, then.

03:08.233 --> 03:10.533
Right, so there's your cake.
Ew.

03:10.600 --> 03:12.467
I cooked it myself.

03:12.533 --> 03:14.633
You need to take this
more seriously.

03:14.700 --> 03:17.967
I would love... a house party.
(all cheer)

03:18.033 --> 03:21.467
There is only one thing
that I love more than house
parties,

03:21.533 --> 03:23.500
and that is festivals.

03:23.567 --> 03:25.033
And as it's my birthday,

03:25.100 --> 03:28.633
I am gonna get these lot to
throw me
a Geordie Fest house party.

03:28.700 --> 03:32.333
I'm really excited now.
I'm gonna take you out.

03:32.400 --> 03:34.733
It's gonna be so fucking
amazing...
Is it?

03:34.800 --> 03:37.200
...you are literally gonna shit
yourself.

03:37.267 --> 03:39.600
Literally?
Who wants to shit themselves?

03:39.667 --> 03:42.100
Shit yourself with excitement.
Jesus.

03:42.167 --> 03:45.067
Nathan is taking me out
for a birthday surprise,

03:45.133 --> 03:47.633
and I know that this will be
a day to remember.

03:47.700 --> 03:49.067
I can feel it.

03:49.133 --> 03:51.267
Alex. Why don't we go on a day
date?

03:51.333 --> 03:53.833
(all) Ooh!

03:53.900 --> 03:57.900
Me and Sophie have so little
time,
so the more I see her, the
better.

03:57.967 --> 04:00.867
Have I gone red?
You actually are.

04:01.800 --> 04:03.433
While I take Alex on a date,

04:03.500 --> 04:07.433
the others are gonna get the
house
ready for Abbie's festival
party.

04:07.500 --> 04:10.667
It's gonna be like
the Geordie version of
Glastonbury.

04:10.733 --> 04:12.600
But with worse toilets.

04:12.667 --> 04:14.367
Who's farted?
Probably me.

04:14.433 --> 04:18.600
Well, since everything's going
on,
I think we should all get ready.

04:18.666 --> 04:20.300
(cheering)

04:32.867 --> 04:35.133
Wearing that on a date?
That, to me, says,

04:35.200 --> 04:38.333
"Hi, I can't be arsed with you,
with this date."

04:38.400 --> 04:41.133
"Not showered,
I'm gonna make minimal effort."

04:41.200 --> 04:44.200
Right, so what do you think?
You should wear a nice top.

04:44.267 --> 04:46.600
That might be high fashion
in Australia,

04:46.667 --> 04:49.200
but not for a classy girl
like Sophie.

04:49.267 --> 04:51.033
She's from Newcastle, after all.

04:51.100 --> 04:54.133
Try it over the top.
We'll iron it before you go.

04:54.200 --> 04:56.500
(Sam) Look at that.
That is actually nice.

05:02.333 --> 05:04.700
Before our date,
I thought I'd surprise Alex

05:04.767 --> 05:06.700
and take him to my dad's
restaurant.

05:15.833 --> 05:18.167
Out of all the places in
Newcastle...

05:18.233 --> 05:21.700
You know I tell you about
my dad's restaurant? This is it.

05:21.767 --> 05:23.300
No way... It's beautiful.

05:23.367 --> 05:26.800
I can't believe Sophie's brought
me
to her dad's restaurant.

05:26.867 --> 05:29.600
Lucky he isn't here,
cos nothing says cock-block

05:29.667 --> 05:31.333
like a dad on a dinner date.

05:31.400 --> 05:34.767
Have a cheers. To being in
Newcastle.
That looks nice.

05:34.833 --> 05:38.033
When we were living down under,
there were sparks flying.

05:38.100 --> 05:42.433
But now that he's here in
Newcastle,
I can feel sparks down under.

05:42.500 --> 05:46.033
I love who you are. I just love
Alex.
Yeah.

05:46.100 --> 05:48.167
I don't want a dog,
a house or anything.

05:48.233 --> 05:51.100
Don't need to be scared.
Oh, OK. I'll put the ring back.

05:51.167 --> 05:52.667
(laughs) Fuck off.

05:52.733 --> 05:55.267
Ooh... look at that!

05:58.200 --> 06:00.600
This prawn kebab looks ripper.

06:00.667 --> 06:03.733
Now I just need to get Sophie
some more wine. Garcon!

06:03.800 --> 06:06.100
Bring your best bottle of rose!

06:06.167 --> 06:07.867
Hi, how are you?
How are you?

06:07.933 --> 06:09.900
You all right?
Hang on a mo!

06:09.967 --> 06:12.633
Why's this waiter dude
kissing my bird?

06:12.700 --> 06:14.333
This is my dad.

06:14.400 --> 06:16.000
What. The. Fuck?

06:16.067 --> 06:17.533
All right...

06:17.600 --> 06:19.000
Pleased to meet you. OK?

06:19.067 --> 06:21.233
The bill's on him.
(laughs)

06:21.300 --> 06:22.667
You OK?
Yeah, I'm fine.

06:22.733 --> 06:25.067
Put your hand out. You're
shaking.

06:25.133 --> 06:26.900
No, I'm not!
You are.

06:27.867 --> 06:30.700
That was awkward.
I did not know what to say.

06:30.767 --> 06:34.567
"Nice to meet you, sir.
Your daughter gives great
blowjobs."

06:35.367 --> 06:36.700
You've been a lucky man.

06:36.767 --> 06:39.933
Think of all the things
I've done with you.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.833
So, I think I deserve something.

06:42.767 --> 06:44.233
Do I get the pleasure?

06:44.300 --> 06:47.933
The prawn kebabs were bonza.
But I've lost my appetite.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.100
I think it's time
to get out of here.

06:58.300 --> 07:02.600
I cannot wait to see where
Nathan
is taking me for my birthday
treat.

07:02.667 --> 07:06.067
He definitely knows his shit
when it comes to surprises.

07:07.667 --> 07:09.733
You're gonna feel so refreshed.

07:09.800 --> 07:11.467
You're gonna feel so light.

07:11.533 --> 07:13.667
You're gonna feel, like,
detoxified.

07:13.733 --> 07:16.000
You're gonna feel like
pure cotton wool.

07:19.500 --> 07:20.600
What is going on?

07:20.667 --> 07:23.833
All of Newcastle' fanciest spas
are back in that direction.

07:23.900 --> 07:27.000
Nathan must be taking me
somewhere amazing.

07:28.533 --> 07:29.900
Here we are!

07:31.033 --> 07:32.800
What the fuck?

07:32.867 --> 07:34.967
We're having a massage?
Nope.

07:35.033 --> 07:37.233
Turning 21 is a rite of passage.

07:37.300 --> 07:41.267
So I've arranged for Abbie to
get
a pipe shoved up her passage.

07:41.333 --> 07:43.333
Think... Think...
Is it a colonic?

07:43.400 --> 07:45.867
Yes.
Oh, for fuck's sake...

07:45.933 --> 07:48.567
Nathan's birthday present
turns out to be

07:48.633 --> 07:51.033
me shitting myself
in front of a stranger.

07:51.100 --> 07:52.800
What a great friend.

07:52.867 --> 07:55.800
Come on, then. Get yourself in,
spread your legs.

08:00.100 --> 08:02.033
(both laugh)

08:02.100 --> 08:04.667
(shrieks)

08:04.733 --> 08:07.900
You wanted a bonding experience,
this is what you get.

08:07.967 --> 08:09.067
It feels like a dick!

08:09.133 --> 08:13.000
Come on, Abbie. You've shoved
things up my arse in the past.

08:13.067 --> 08:14.700
Just lay there and enjoy it.

08:14.767 --> 08:17.067
Ow!
Breathe! Breathe! You're in.

08:17.133 --> 08:20.167
Ah, no, I don't like it.
It's OK, it's in now. It's in.

08:20.233 --> 08:21.333
Take a deep breath.

08:21.400 --> 08:23.333
I never thought in a million
years

08:23.400 --> 08:26.233
that it would be Nathan
taking my anal virginity.

08:31.400 --> 08:34.732
Oh, my God, it's getting dark.
Look at the tube... Fuck me!

08:34.799 --> 08:38.100
Oh! What the hell is that?
(groans)

08:38.167 --> 08:40.832
That's potato skin. Jacket
potatoes?

08:40.900 --> 08:44.100
She had a potato today.
I had a potato for me lunch.

08:44.167 --> 08:48.467
Shit a brick. That potato went
through me like a Ferrari.

08:48.533 --> 08:49.900
(shrieks)

08:50.700 --> 08:53.533
What? Has it come out?
I think you pushed it out.

08:53.600 --> 08:56.000
Looks like Abbie's pooped.
We better go.

08:56.067 --> 08:59.433
I just hope the others have
started prepping for the party.

09:09.033 --> 09:12.900
Come on, Sam. Get on the leaves.
I'll put the wellies by the
door.

09:14.067 --> 09:15.767
Adam, you get on them.

09:17.567 --> 09:19.933
(cheering)

09:20.000 --> 09:23.600
All right, youse lot. Nathan
and Abbie are gonna be back
soon.

09:23.667 --> 09:25.333
Geordie Fest needs to be ready.

09:25.400 --> 09:27.467
Everybody get your festival
bands on.

09:27.533 --> 09:29.700
Otherwise,
you're not allowed to come.

09:29.767 --> 09:31.867
(Sam) How much?
Oh, that's so mint!

09:35.367 --> 09:38.767
There's no way I'm letting my
rat
babies see me get rat-arsed,

09:38.833 --> 09:41.933
so Donald and Theresa are
spending
the night at me ma's.

09:46.300 --> 09:48.033
Oh, where? Whereabouts?

09:49.067 --> 09:52.733
Sophie took Alex to meet her
dad?
She must want to marry him.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.067
So, how do you feel now?

09:54.133 --> 09:56.600
Are you together?
Are you in a relationship?

09:56.667 --> 09:59.100
I don't want to complicate it
at all.

09:59.167 --> 10:00.900
I don't want to put a label on
it.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.600
I'm having a good time,
that's all that matters.

10:06.267 --> 10:10.333
We're back, and I don't want
Abbie
to see what the others have
done,

10:10.400 --> 10:12.200
so I'm taking her upstairs.

10:12.267 --> 10:13.267
(shrieks)
Shit.

10:13.333 --> 10:15.000
Abbie, no peeking.

10:15.067 --> 10:17.867
Everyone stand the fuck back...

10:17.933 --> 10:20.400
Right.
...because she's just had a
colonic.

10:20.467 --> 10:22.767
She could blow at any given
moment.

10:22.833 --> 10:25.033
With friends like that,
who needs enemas?

10:25.100 --> 10:27.200
Don't poo on the floor like me!

10:27.267 --> 10:29.433
She screamed like a bitch.
Awful.

10:29.500 --> 10:31.933
Hello! Hiya!

10:32.000 --> 10:33.867
This is my friend, everyone!

10:33.933 --> 10:36.767
My friend's arrived to help
everyone
get tarted up.

10:36.833 --> 10:40.600
Us girls are gonna look
incredible.
Let's get the glitter on.

10:40.667 --> 10:44.100
Come on, everybody!
Glitter tits! Glitter tits!

10:58.300 --> 11:01.533
(Faith) I'm so excited for this.
It's your first one.

11:01.600 --> 11:02.733
A house party.

11:02.800 --> 11:04.767
Tonight is my first house party,

11:04.833 --> 11:06.733
and I can't wait to see my
friends.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.300
It's gonna be amazing.

11:08.367 --> 11:10.733
Abbie, today is all about you.

11:10.800 --> 11:13.367
It is...
No, sorry, tonight is all about
you.

11:23.667 --> 11:26.767
I think, right, this is gonna be
the best house party ever.

11:26.833 --> 11:29.100
I feel like we've made
a really good effort.

11:29.167 --> 11:32.300
How was your date today?
We turn up to this nice
restaurant,

11:32.367 --> 11:35.733
I'm thinking we're gonna have
a lovely lunch, her dad turns
up.

11:35.800 --> 11:37.533
It's her dad's.
No way!

11:37.600 --> 11:40.833
That's a bit cheap.
She gets her food there for
free!

11:40.900 --> 11:44.333
You met her dad on the first
date?
Who does that?!

11:44.400 --> 11:47.200
I think I made a good
impression.
Alex. You know what?

11:47.267 --> 11:49.100
Could be worse, mate.
How?

11:49.167 --> 11:51.133
I don't know.
(laughter)

11:51.200 --> 11:53.400
Howay, let's get down there.

11:53.467 --> 11:56.233
To the festival!
(all) To the festival!

12:02.967 --> 12:04.633
I'm no fashionista,

12:04.700 --> 12:08.600
but this glittery tit trend,
I could get on board with.

12:08.667 --> 12:10.700
Ready! Drumroll for Abbie...

12:10.767 --> 12:13.433
(all drum hands, shout)

12:13.500 --> 12:15.100
Surprise!

12:15.167 --> 12:17.467
(cheering)
Oh, my God!

12:18.700 --> 12:23.600
This is amazing. I have got
my very own Geordie festival.

12:23.667 --> 12:25.600
Tonight is gonna be mint.

12:25.667 --> 12:27.900
(all) Happy birthday!

12:28.933 --> 12:30.033
(cheering)

12:33.467 --> 12:36.167
Everybody's here
having a belter of a time.

12:36.233 --> 12:39.233
Even fit Geordie lasses,
who are canny shaggers.

12:39.300 --> 12:42.333
Tonight has definitely ended
with a bang.

12:43.300 --> 12:45.733
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

12:48.000 --> 12:48.200
.

12:50.733 --> 12:50.900
.

13:02.633 --> 13:04.600
(all chant) Down it! Down it!

13:04.667 --> 13:08.500
It's my 21st birthday, and these
lot
have pulled out all the stops.

13:08.567 --> 13:09.867
Bring it on.

13:09.933 --> 13:13.500
(all) Five, four, three, two,
one...

13:13.567 --> 13:14.833
(cheering)

13:14.900 --> 13:17.933
I wanna make sure Abbie has
the best night of her life.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.667
So I've invited
a very special VIP guest.

13:20.733 --> 13:23.933
I just hope she didn't
get the glittery tits memo.

13:24.833 --> 13:28.967
(cheering)

13:29.033 --> 13:30.333
That's a relief.

13:30.400 --> 13:33.667
I think that dress suits Nana
better than glitter would.

13:36.900 --> 13:40.367
Fucking Nana! She's an absolute
legend on the Gold Coast.

13:40.433 --> 13:43.600
All my mates keep on talking
about her still to this day.

13:43.667 --> 13:45.200
Abbie!
(shrieks)

13:45.267 --> 13:47.333
It's your birthday!
I know!

13:48.533 --> 13:51.300
(cheering)

13:51.367 --> 13:56.067
I'm so happy to see Abbie
on her birthday. This is
champion.

13:56.133 --> 13:58.900
(cheering)

14:01.400 --> 14:02.867
(screaming)

14:03.700 --> 14:06.367
All of my friends
have just turned up.

14:06.433 --> 14:08.133
I am in birthday heaven.

14:16.033 --> 14:18.400
(cheering)

14:20.500 --> 14:24.900
Holy shit, it's Laura. Last time
I
seen her, it didn't end well for
me.

14:24.967 --> 14:27.533
Abbie cock-blocked us
and she ended up leaving.

14:38.033 --> 14:39.933
Now my old friends have arrived,

14:40.000 --> 14:42.433
let's show them
how we do things in this house.

14:47.967 --> 14:50.900
Everybody's here,
having a belter of a time.

15:02.667 --> 15:03.767
Give it a few weeks,

15:03.833 --> 15:07.267
I bet all the girls down the
Bigg
Market will be rocking glitter.

15:16.633 --> 15:19.367
I hope that me and Alex
are on the same wavelength,

15:19.433 --> 15:21.167
and just up for having some fun.

15:21.233 --> 15:25.400
Maybe tonight, he'll be going
down
under sooner than he expected.

15:40.267 --> 15:43.667
I don't get why Sophie doesn't
shag his brains out and enjoy
it.

15:44.667 --> 15:48.733
(dance music)

15:56.333 --> 16:00.400
In a funny way, Sophie smacking
me
in Benidorm has cleared the air,

16:00.467 --> 16:01.900
and we've became friends.

16:27.967 --> 16:31.500
I used to think I'd always be
an outsider in this house,

16:31.567 --> 16:35.600
but look at us now! Totally
buckled,
covered in glitter, loving my
life.

16:43.200 --> 16:45.700
I am having the best night ever.

16:45.767 --> 16:49.033
The family is proper going for
it,
Chloe looks fit as fuck.

16:49.100 --> 16:51.033
Geordie Fest is the best.

16:57.300 --> 17:01.067
It's nearly time to head home,
and me and Sam couldn't be
closer.

17:01.133 --> 17:03.100
I just love him so much.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.532
(Adam) I've learned me lesson.

17:15.599 --> 17:18.133
From now on, friends first
instead of lasses.

17:18.200 --> 17:21.032
Even fit Geordie lasses
who are canny shaggers.

17:22.800 --> 17:25.800
(laughs) Oh, I love this!

17:25.867 --> 17:28.000
I'm having a lovely time!

17:28.067 --> 17:30.533
(laughs) Do you know what it is,
Holly, right?

17:30.600 --> 17:32.700
I feel we're on the same
wavelength.

17:32.767 --> 17:35.500
I feel like you're not thick.
I hate thick people.

17:35.567 --> 17:38.067
Holly has been amazing
since she's came in.

17:38.133 --> 17:42.233
She's really boosted my
confidence
and brought us closer.

17:42.300 --> 17:44.233
(shrieks)
I wanna play!

17:44.300 --> 17:46.867
I wanna be five. (yells)

17:46.933 --> 17:48.967
No, the drink!
Where's your drink?

17:56.267 --> 18:00.433
I love candy floss, me. This is
the best party I've ever been
to!

18:17.300 --> 18:20.467
Nana is mortal,
so it's time for her to go.

18:20.533 --> 18:21.833
Come on!

18:23.833 --> 18:25.433
Nana!

18:26.233 --> 18:29.233
Nana's refusing to leave.
Have to call the old bill.

18:29.300 --> 18:31.467
Or, in Nana's case,
the very old bill.

18:31.533 --> 18:32.900
Say bye to Nana!

18:34.200 --> 18:36.467
No!

18:37.600 --> 18:39.900
Come on, Abbie.
Let me have another drink.

18:39.967 --> 18:41.867
Remember, I have wiped your
arse!

18:41.933 --> 18:43.667
Nana, no!

18:43.733 --> 18:45.567
Nana, no, come on. Get out.

18:47.333 --> 18:48.733
Get out!

18:48.800 --> 18:51.833
Nana is finally leaving.
Thank fuck for that.

18:51.900 --> 18:54.933
She is getting far too
comfortable
in this house.

19:03.800 --> 19:07.733
I am pretty hammered, and Alex
looks
like a god through these
glasses.

19:07.800 --> 19:10.533
I need to get him alone pretty
soon.

19:14.700 --> 19:17.900
It's hard for me to show my
emotion.
You know that.

19:17.967 --> 19:23.300
I really like you. Like, more
than
I've liked anyone in a long
time.

19:23.367 --> 19:27.433
Sophie's trying to get deep and
meaningful, but I'm too
plastered.

19:27.500 --> 19:31.600
I enjoy spending time with you,
and
I'd like to spend more time with
you.

19:31.667 --> 19:36.467
I think I mean I want to spend
more
time with Alex in the shag pad.

19:40.267 --> 19:42.533
Love you, baby!
Aw, thank you for coming.

19:47.167 --> 19:50.900
I have drank far too much
tonight.
Time for me to get to bed.

20:07.400 --> 20:10.200
Hey, you actually having a wee?
No, babe, I'm good.

20:10.267 --> 20:12.600
(laughs) Don't wee.

20:12.667 --> 20:15.000
(Chloe) I am absolutely
balingoed.

20:15.067 --> 20:17.967
I need to go to bed.
But that party was amazing!

20:33.000 --> 20:35.767
I was so happy
when Alex turned up in
Newcastle.

20:35.833 --> 20:38.700
I just didn't want to
jump into bed straight away.

20:38.767 --> 20:41.700
But I've had such a good time
on our date,

20:41.767 --> 20:44.433
and tonight has definitely ended
with a bang.

20:47.333 --> 20:50.133
Last night was incredible.
Thank you very much.

20:50.200 --> 20:53.200
I've been sick all morning.
That's a good birthday.

20:53.267 --> 20:55.400
Unfortunately,
we do it again tonight.

20:55.467 --> 20:57.933
Sophie's riding Alex
like a racehorse!

20:58.000 --> 21:00.433
Like the Grand National in here!
(cheering)

21:00.500 --> 21:02.867
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

21:05.433 --> 21:05.633
.

21:08.200 --> 21:08.400
.

21:24.033 --> 21:26.667
(Nathan) We throw
the best house parties ever.

21:26.733 --> 21:29.067
Oh, my God...
I'm done.

21:29.133 --> 21:34.233
(yawns) That party was
the best house party ever.

21:34.300 --> 21:37.100
The only problem is,
I'm hanging out my back tit.

21:37.167 --> 21:39.433
This is what my day's
going to consist of.

21:39.500 --> 21:42.167
I'm gonna go for a piss and a
shit...
(retches)

21:42.233 --> 21:43.600
(retches)
Get out.

21:43.667 --> 21:45.033
Out.

21:47.033 --> 21:51.567
What a house party. I will
remember
that for the rest of my life.

21:51.633 --> 21:54.000
After I stop feeling so rank.

21:54.067 --> 21:56.100
(vomits)

21:59.933 --> 22:01.567
(Holly) Youse, I'm not well.

22:01.633 --> 22:05.400
Oh, same. Fucking hell, man,
I feel like I've been hit by a
bus.

22:05.467 --> 22:10.467
Last night was a hundred times
better than I could have
imagined.

22:10.533 --> 22:14.267
My first house party was
amazing.
Don't know why these lot feel
shit.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.800
Must have forgot
to line their stomachs.

22:16.867 --> 22:19.100
All I want is a sausage sandwich
and bed.

22:19.167 --> 22:22.700
I could murder
a veggie sausage sandwich.

22:22.767 --> 22:24.733
(laughs)
Bye.

22:24.800 --> 22:26.867
Simple as that. (laughs)

22:29.833 --> 22:31.367
Can I just say...

22:32.267 --> 22:34.467
...I took your shag pad
virginity.

22:34.533 --> 22:36.100
Thank you very much.

22:36.167 --> 22:38.200
It feels so good
to wake up with Alex.

22:38.267 --> 22:41.033
I'm gonna make the most
out of our remaining time.

22:41.100 --> 22:44.000
Preferably with some
top-quality shagging.

22:44.067 --> 22:49.000
We've woke up on the last day in
the
shag pad with Alex from
Australia.

22:49.067 --> 22:52.600
Well, I didn't expect to be
here,
either, but I'm here now.

22:52.667 --> 22:55.500
Feeling pretty smug,
waking up next to Sophie.

22:55.567 --> 22:58.767
We had a great night,
and I'm well up for another
shag.

22:58.833 --> 23:01.367
Come on, I hate morning sex.
(groans)

23:01.433 --> 23:03.033
Go on. Brush your teeth.

23:11.967 --> 23:13.500
Did you have a good birthday?

23:13.567 --> 23:16.667
I've been sick all morning.
That's a good birthday.

23:16.733 --> 23:19.267
That's proper festival shit.
Proper festival.

23:19.333 --> 23:22.367
We are all feeling destroyed,
and unfortunately,

23:22.433 --> 23:24.467
we've gotta do it all again
tonight,

23:24.533 --> 23:27.700
for our last night out in the
Toon
together.

23:27.767 --> 23:30.833
(sighs) I just can't...

23:30.900 --> 23:33.433
We're just all fucked, aren't
we?
Look at we.

23:33.500 --> 23:35.000
We're so fucked.

23:35.067 --> 23:37.233
What's this "I feel fucked"
talk?

23:37.300 --> 23:40.267
We've got one last night
of serious drinking,

23:40.333 --> 23:43.867
so I'm gonna cook up a storm
so everyone is back on top form.

23:43.933 --> 23:45.867
Chloe, have you seen my spatula?

23:45.933 --> 23:48.133
The only way I know
how tired you are.

23:48.200 --> 23:51.833
Has that been on the floor since
last night? It'll be fine.

23:51.900 --> 23:53.900
Waste not, want not!

24:06.067 --> 24:08.567
Ooh, spag bol!

24:08.633 --> 24:10.933
First time we have
made a meal together.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.200
I'm always making food for you,
you never make food for me.

24:14.267 --> 24:17.167
Shows I'm the boss.
I just take you out more often.

24:19.600 --> 24:21.000
(bubbles)
Ready?

24:21.067 --> 24:22.533
My mam is an expert cook,

24:22.600 --> 24:26.400
and she taught me a tip on how
to know if your spaghetti is
ready.

24:29.233 --> 24:30.300
(cheers)

24:30.367 --> 24:32.900
You should see her kitchen wall.
It's a mess.

24:34.067 --> 24:37.833
That's ready, take it off.
Keep it on! Turn the knob down.

24:37.900 --> 24:39.733
It's time to get everybody down

24:39.800 --> 24:42.533
for a meal they will never
forget.

24:42.600 --> 24:44.600
Me and you are good in the
kitchen.

24:49.067 --> 24:50.700
What'd you do to your dress?

24:50.767 --> 24:53.033
Had a bit of a cum fight.

24:53.100 --> 24:54.867
(Nathan) Bit dry.
Bit more, sir?

24:54.933 --> 24:56.200
(Alex) Yes, please.

24:56.267 --> 24:57.833
All you do is put water in it.

24:57.900 --> 25:01.433
It's actually really nice.
It's really nice. Lot of
flavour.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.767
I think you're taking the piss.
I'm not.

25:03.833 --> 25:05.800
D'you know what is nice, though?

25:05.867 --> 25:09.800
For our final night in the
house,
we can have a sit-down meal.

25:09.867 --> 25:13.033
(Holly) Cheers, everyone.
(all) Cheers!

25:13.100 --> 25:16.200
Gotta forget the hangover,
give themselves a makeover

25:16.267 --> 25:18.067
and get ready for the last
night.

25:18.133 --> 25:19.433
It is gonna be big.

25:24.133 --> 25:26.233
(fart)
Who trumped?

25:26.300 --> 25:27.933
Who just Donald Trumped?
You.

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
Less than 24 hours after getting
her arse washed out,

25:31.067 --> 25:32.767
Abbie is back to her old ways.

25:32.833 --> 25:34.367
To the girls!

25:34.433 --> 25:36.333
(all) To the girls!

25:38.433 --> 25:41.767
Boys, it's the final night.
I can't believe it.

25:41.833 --> 25:43.367
It's been a pleasure.

25:43.433 --> 25:45.867
I'm gonna miss these Geordie
boys.

25:45.933 --> 25:49.033
So, let's smash the arse
out of this night. Yee-haw!

26:02.200 --> 26:05.300
Girls! It's our last night!

26:05.367 --> 26:08.100
(yells)

26:10.333 --> 26:12.667
Why's Faith come as
the Little Mermaid?

26:16.267 --> 26:18.100
Fuck me, Sophie looks ripper.

26:18.167 --> 26:21.400
I can't believe a flaming galah
like me managed to pull her.

26:21.467 --> 26:24.200
It's the final night,
which I'm quite sad about.

26:24.267 --> 26:26.800
But let's make this
the one night to remember.

26:26.867 --> 26:29.433
To the family!
(all cheer)

26:29.500 --> 26:32.100
Now, let's go to the fucking
club!

26:32.167 --> 26:36.200
I am well up for tonight!
It's time to get absolutely
twatted!

26:47.467 --> 26:50.033
We've arrived at the club.
It's bouncing.

26:50.100 --> 26:52.633
I wanna have a good night
with me lad and besties.

27:04.667 --> 27:05.800
(all cheer)

27:05.867 --> 27:09.500
It's been amazing to see
how much Faith has changed.

27:09.567 --> 27:12.833
I look at her now, and I think
of her like my little sister.

27:17.967 --> 27:20.300
Alex is on one tonight!

27:20.367 --> 27:24.167
Not to be outdone, I'm gonna
match
him, drink for drink. Let's go.

27:36.333 --> 27:38.533
I might only work part-time
these days,

27:38.600 --> 27:40.933
but it has been amazing being
back.

27:56.967 --> 27:59.333
We're all having a wicked night,

27:59.400 --> 28:02.300
and Sam and Chloe's spag bol
has done the trick.

28:06.267 --> 28:09.367
Me and Adam are starting
from a different place.

28:09.433 --> 28:12.733
We've learned to respect each
other
as people and friends,

28:12.800 --> 28:14.667
and I really appreciate that.

28:26.567 --> 28:30.167
Abbie's the only girl I've had
a friendship with, besides me
mam.

28:30.233 --> 28:32.633
It's been a pleasure
getting to know her.

28:32.700 --> 28:35.300
Though unlike me mam,
I would like to fuck her.

28:56.000 --> 28:59.767
Hair extensions up the nostril
is not ideal in a social
situation.

28:59.833 --> 29:01.867
I wonder if this happens
to the Queen?

29:07.100 --> 29:11.533
I am so happy that mine and
Sam's
relationship is stronger than
ever.

29:33.233 --> 29:34.967
We're all having a belter,

29:35.033 --> 29:37.500
but it looks like Sam is
a few bevvies ahead.

29:37.567 --> 29:40.800
At this rate,
it'll be me putting him to bed!

30:07.700 --> 30:10.400
I know there was one time in Oz
I got whiskey dick,

30:10.467 --> 30:13.467
but not this time.
Not when Sophie's looking this
fit.

30:24.633 --> 30:26.667
I have no idea
what Chloe's on about.

30:26.733 --> 30:30.800
All I know is, I love this crazy
girl. She'll always be my day
one.

30:35.767 --> 30:37.933
(cheering)

30:48.100 --> 30:50.333
I've definitely had
some ups and downs,

30:50.400 --> 30:53.900
but with girls like Holly and
Abbie,
I've made amazing friends,

30:53.967 --> 30:55.267
and I'm loving my life.

30:55.333 --> 30:57.367
(yells)

31:09.000 --> 31:11.267
I'm glad me and Faith
are good friends.

31:11.333 --> 31:14.833
I can't believe I got angry
she wouldn't nosh off a dildo!

31:25.833 --> 31:29.633
This has been a mint night,
and everyone is mortal.

31:29.700 --> 31:32.500
It's time to head home
for one last time.

31:40.133 --> 31:43.500
Last time for feeding time
at the zoo!

31:43.567 --> 31:47.367
We've arrived back, and call me
Marvin, cos I'm fuckin'
starving.

31:47.433 --> 31:50.600
(babbles) Fuckin' chicken
nuggets.

31:50.667 --> 31:53.600
Cheesy at the bar.
They're all so cheesy!

31:53.667 --> 31:55.200
(chatter)

31:58.467 --> 32:01.800
This time tomorrow, Alex is
gonna be
on a plane to Australia.

32:01.867 --> 32:04.333
So he's coming with me, right
now.

32:10.667 --> 32:12.500
It's our last night in the
house,

32:12.567 --> 32:14.233
and what better way to spend it

32:14.300 --> 32:16.967
than us lot sleeping together
on the floor!

32:17.033 --> 32:19.200
C'mon.
(mumbles)

32:19.267 --> 32:23.700
Sam is completely mortal.
I need to get him to bed ASAP.

32:30.300 --> 32:34.133
Fuckin' hell! Sophie and Alex
are shagging. Get the popcorn.

32:37.067 --> 32:39.933
Damn right, it's in.
No whiskey dick here.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.267
(all chanting) Go! Go!

32:42.333 --> 32:43.533
(cheering)

32:43.600 --> 32:47.333
Sophie's riding Alex like a
horse.
It's the Grand National in here!

32:47.400 --> 32:51.467
(cheering)

32:51.533 --> 32:55.533
These radgies are watching me
and
Alex have a not-so-sneaky
bunk-up.

32:55.600 --> 32:59.333
I should've went to the shag
pad,
but with the risk of a whiskey
dick,

32:59.400 --> 33:01.733
you've got to hop on when it's
ready.

33:01.800 --> 33:02.800
(laughs)

33:02.867 --> 33:04.567
No, but...
Right, I can't.

33:04.633 --> 33:05.967
Why you sweating?

33:09.767 --> 33:11.667
Night, everyone!
G'night.

33:11.733 --> 33:12.867
Night.

33:16.967 --> 33:18.067
I'm gonna miss you.

33:18.133 --> 33:20.033
Once again, we're saying
goodbye.

33:20.100 --> 33:23.900
So much has happened. Falling
out
with Chloe, making up with
Chloe.

33:23.967 --> 33:25.733
Bye, guys!

33:25.800 --> 33:28.333
I really love these crazy
bastards.

33:28.400 --> 33:30.800
I'm glad I shagged him when I
could.

33:30.867 --> 33:33.133
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

33:35.933 --> 33:36.133
.

33:38.667 --> 33:38.867
.

33:58.167 --> 34:00.900
(Faith) Good morning!

34:00.967 --> 34:03.400
(all cheer weakly)

34:03.467 --> 34:07.533
I have never been so squished.
I feel like a fuckin' sardine.

34:07.600 --> 34:09.766
Tin o' mackerel, tin o'
mackerel.

34:09.833 --> 34:12.833
What a lovely way to spend
our last night together.

34:12.900 --> 34:15.167
All snuggled together in one
room.

34:15.233 --> 34:19.067
Who was spooning who?
Tried to touch Holly with my
toes.

34:19.132 --> 34:21.600
What was going on with youse two
last night?

34:21.667 --> 34:23.467
Fuck all.
Fuck all, huh?

34:23.533 --> 34:25.667
I seen it going
deep inside the vagina.

34:25.733 --> 34:28.167
Yeah, I shagged him.
I even smelled it.

34:28.233 --> 34:32.367
It was Abbie's idea we all
"slept together" in the same
room.

34:32.433 --> 34:34.967
I just took it one step further.

34:36.467 --> 34:38.667
Alex, I love you.

34:38.733 --> 34:40.667
Ew!
(laughs)

34:44.933 --> 34:47.699
I am so excited
to go home with Sam today.

35:00.833 --> 35:03.400
(groaning)
Oh, my God.

35:03.467 --> 35:05.467
Smell that.
(Holly) Nah, I can't...

35:06.800 --> 35:10.000
I have just found a pasty in my
bag
from Benidorm,

35:10.067 --> 35:12.767
and it absolutely stinks.

35:12.833 --> 35:15.600
This whole time,
I thought it was Chloe's feet.

35:15.667 --> 35:18.267
How have we been living like
this?

35:28.933 --> 35:30.700
Come on, then!
Let's go!

35:35.567 --> 35:37.467
I can't believe it's our final
day.

35:37.533 --> 35:39.767
It's gonna be so hard
saying goodbye.

35:39.833 --> 35:41.833
They're all fucking brilliant.

35:41.900 --> 35:46.333
Let this motherfucking party
begin!

35:48.100 --> 35:50.700
I cannot wait to get fucking
mortal!

35:53.067 --> 35:54.833
(Faith) Hello!

35:54.900 --> 35:56.833
Who the hell is she?

35:56.900 --> 36:00.833
I can't put words on it,
how excited I am. (laughs)

36:00.900 --> 36:02.467
I like to talk to Jesus.

36:02.533 --> 36:05.133
Oh, my God. I wasn't expecting
that.

36:05.200 --> 36:07.367
(Alex) Aussie, Aussie, Aussie!

36:07.433 --> 36:08.767
Oh, my God!

36:09.600 --> 36:11.733
Feels like I've never been away.

36:11.800 --> 36:13.700
Hello, youse!

36:13.767 --> 36:15.300
Yoo-hoo!
Nana!

36:15.367 --> 36:18.567
Let's hit the strip.
Benny isn't going to drink
itself.

36:20.267 --> 36:22.333
Kyle has walked through the
door.

36:22.400 --> 36:24.600
I've grown up a lot.
I hope you have.

36:24.667 --> 36:25.900
I'm trying to be nice.

36:25.967 --> 36:27.433
Oh, my God...

36:27.500 --> 36:30.567
(Scotty) Long time no fuckin'
see!

36:30.633 --> 36:33.433
Newcastle's biggest arsehole
is back in the mix,

36:33.500 --> 36:35.167
and he's landed a promotion!

36:36.133 --> 36:37.533
Ah!

36:37.600 --> 36:39.900
Everybody's going to fuckin'
work.
Yay!

36:39.967 --> 36:42.567
He's always happy, and
good-looking.

36:42.633 --> 36:45.533
Oh!
(Nathan) He is a full man-child.

36:45.600 --> 36:49.200
Say bye-bye to Scotty T,
and hello to Scotty Tree.

36:49.267 --> 36:52.367
(Sophie) Girls' trip!

36:52.433 --> 36:54.433
I am shitting myself.

36:54.500 --> 36:56.500
(screaming)

36:59.667 --> 37:02.000
It's a good job
I've had me crack waxed.

37:02.067 --> 37:03.800
(farts)
(laughter)

37:03.867 --> 37:05.367
Cor, fuckin' hell!

37:05.433 --> 37:08.067
He definitely got a semi
off my pirouette.

37:09.467 --> 37:12.100
(laughs)
Get off me, I can't swim!

37:13.233 --> 37:15.167
We're gonna tear Benny a new
one!

37:15.233 --> 37:17.800
(shouting)

37:20.400 --> 37:22.033
(Sam) Dirty bastard!

37:22.100 --> 37:23.867
(retching)

37:26.533 --> 37:29.033
Jealous?
What have I got to be jealous
about?

37:29.100 --> 37:30.667
Not fucking jealous of you!

37:30.733 --> 37:32.467
Sophie's actually lost it.

37:32.533 --> 37:35.100
I dare you... deep-throat.

37:35.167 --> 37:37.900
Fuck youse all.
I feel like I just can't win.

37:37.967 --> 37:39.100
Fuck off!

37:39.167 --> 37:40.533
But you were...
No!

37:43.067 --> 37:45.733
Tonight has definitely ended
with a bang.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.067
Hello!

37:50.233 --> 37:51.567
Why not?

37:53.200 --> 37:55.700
(cheering)

37:58.633 --> 38:00.767
We came, we saw, we conquered,

38:00.833 --> 38:04.067
and once again, we tore the
fuckin'
back end off the Toon.

38:04.133 --> 38:06.767
To the family!
(all cheer)

38:08.967 --> 38:10.833
And she strikes again!

38:13.300 --> 38:16.100
Are you gonna miss your bed
you've hardly slept in?

38:16.167 --> 38:19.700
I loved having Alex around.
Once again, we're saying
goodbye.

38:19.767 --> 38:23.767
When I left Australia, I said,
you've helped us so much, thank
you.

38:23.833 --> 38:25.967
I'm a stronger person now.

38:26.033 --> 38:28.733
You can probably tell, I've
changed.
Definitely.

38:28.800 --> 38:32.100
I feel like I've broken down
those walls, finally.

38:32.167 --> 38:34.600
Doesn't matter where
me and Sophie are,

38:34.667 --> 38:36.600
we'll always have that
connection.

38:36.667 --> 38:38.967
As long as she's happy,
that's all I want.

38:39.033 --> 38:41.600
It's been really, really good
having you here.

38:41.667 --> 38:43.433
You've helped us get through it.

38:43.500 --> 38:45.267
Gimme a kiss.
I'm gonna miss you.

38:45.333 --> 38:47.867
Who knows what's gonna happen
in the future?

38:49.700 --> 38:52.900
I'm glad I took Holly's advice
and shagged him when I could.

38:58.867 --> 39:01.733
Sam has done a good job looking
after the rat babies.

39:01.800 --> 39:04.600
I hope he's just as good looking
after actual babies.

39:04.667 --> 39:07.233
Right, youse, before I go,
I need to do summat.

39:07.300 --> 39:11.533
Howay, there's a load of paint
left over, and I've got an idea.

39:11.600 --> 39:14.300
I'm gonna tag me name,
we should all do it.

39:17.733 --> 39:20.633
OK, I wanna get it over
and done with and get going.

39:20.700 --> 39:21.700
Bye, gorge.

39:21.767 --> 39:24.633
Amongst all the craziness,
so much has happened.

39:24.700 --> 39:28.767
Falling out with Chloe, making
up,
becoming close with Abbie.

39:28.833 --> 39:31.900
The only thing that hasn't
happened
is sucking a dildo.

39:31.967 --> 39:34.100
Bye, guys!
(all) Bye!

39:36.600 --> 39:39.233
Come here, you!
Give her a kiss, go on.

39:39.300 --> 39:41.733
I really love these bunch of
crazy bastards.

39:41.800 --> 39:43.133
For now, it's time to go.

39:43.200 --> 39:45.400
See youse in a bit! See youse
later!

39:45.467 --> 39:47.933
Love youse all!
Bye!

39:48.767 --> 39:51.300
Howay, some fucker's nicked me
bike!

39:51.367 --> 39:53.267
Thieving Geordie bastards!

39:57.967 --> 40:00.300
It's been quite hard
this time round,

40:00.367 --> 40:03.167
because Sophie and Sam
argued like cat and dog.

40:03.233 --> 40:06.633
Me and Sophie are still best
friends, and that's all I want.

40:06.700 --> 40:07.733
I love her.

40:07.800 --> 40:09.600
See you soon, yeah?

40:09.667 --> 40:10.833
Bye!

40:10.900 --> 40:13.133
I've learned a lot this time
round.

40:13.200 --> 40:17.633
I've realised I need to listen
to
my friends, cos they also love
Chloe,

40:17.700 --> 40:20.433
and I need to take their advice
more seriously.

40:20.500 --> 40:21.933
Bye, guys!

40:22.900 --> 40:25.867
Some people might think
Donald Trump and Theresa May

40:25.933 --> 40:29.400
are filthy and disgusting.
But they're coming home with me!

40:34.933 --> 40:36.600
Anyway...
Have a safe flight!

40:36.667 --> 40:38.367
Love you, but I leave you!

40:38.433 --> 40:39.633
Thanks for coming.

40:39.700 --> 40:43.700
Who knows what could happen?
I've got a long journey ahead,

40:43.767 --> 40:46.167
but nothing like the journey
I've had here.

40:46.233 --> 40:50.133
I'm so glad I popped in to see
the family before I head back.

40:51.667 --> 40:53.600
I don't know where me and Alex
stand.

40:53.667 --> 40:58.067
We're not in a relationship,
but in this house we so are?

40:58.133 --> 41:01.300
Just gotta figure it out.
Don't know how things are gonna
go.

41:01.367 --> 41:05.200
The last 24 hours have been
better
than I could have imagined.

41:05.267 --> 41:09.367
Who knows what's gonna happen
between us? Only time will tell.

41:09.433 --> 41:11.900
Well, listen.
As much as I wanna hang about,

41:11.967 --> 41:14.733
I wanna go actually
see my fucking boyfriend.

41:14.800 --> 41:16.467
So I'll write my name.

41:21.867 --> 41:23.233
Hello!
Oh, Nana!

41:23.300 --> 41:24.333
Here she is!

41:24.400 --> 41:26.667
Hello! Hiya!

41:26.733 --> 41:29.900
I'm so happy
that Nana's come to take us
home.

41:29.967 --> 41:32.533
Nana, put your name on the wall.
Anywhere.

41:35.900 --> 41:37.267
(cheering)

41:37.333 --> 41:41.667
I'm on the wall of fame
with all the other living
legends.

41:41.733 --> 41:44.800
On the cheesy ones!
(laughter)

41:44.867 --> 41:48.400
Every time I leave this house,
it reminds me how grateful I am

41:48.467 --> 41:50.967
that these people came in my
life.
Love youse.

41:51.033 --> 41:53.433
Bye, girls!
Bye, I'll miss you!

41:53.500 --> 41:54.833
Miss you already!

41:54.900 --> 41:57.733
I've loved being in here,
but I feel like the dad.

41:57.800 --> 42:00.233
I'm always dealing with
people's problems.

42:00.300 --> 42:03.633
Can't wait to put my problems
on someone else!

42:03.700 --> 42:06.400
Craig, I'm coming home, baby!

42:08.567 --> 42:10.100
Look up there, at the top.

42:10.167 --> 42:12.733
How many arguments
happened over that balcony?

42:12.800 --> 42:14.633
Me and Charlotte have stood
there

42:14.700 --> 42:17.300
and screamed up
and called Marnie a slag.

42:17.367 --> 42:18.733
I remember screaming.

42:18.800 --> 42:21.433
I remember James,
I went mad at James one time...

42:21.500 --> 42:24.300
And he called us fat.
And he called us fat.

42:24.367 --> 42:26.667
And Martin, like,
everybody in this house

42:26.733 --> 42:29.433
has just had mad brawls,
but then you make up.

42:29.500 --> 42:33.367
I feel like, no matter what
happens,
people come and go...

42:33.433 --> 42:36.467
And nothing ever changes,
apart from the people.

42:36.533 --> 42:38.267
I think we need to sign the
wall.

42:38.333 --> 42:41.600
Because we're day ones...
let's add everyone from Day One.

42:41.667 --> 42:42.800
Let's.

42:42.867 --> 42:46.000
It wouldn't be fair
to leave the old house legends
off.

42:58.300 --> 42:59.767
That's it.

42:59.833 --> 43:02.533
Well, let's fucking go home,
Hols.

43:02.600 --> 43:04.533
Until next time.

43:04.600 --> 43:06.200
Bye, house.

43:06.267 --> 43:08.267
Being the last to leave with
Sophie

43:08.333 --> 43:12.033
is making me think of all the
flirting, fighting,
fornicating...

43:12.100 --> 43:15.067
You will never find a more
passionate group of radgies

43:15.133 --> 43:16.800
than right here in Newcastle.

43:32.500 --> 43:36.267
(Scott) 'What about Scotty T?
Bunch of arseholes.'

44:03.433 --> 44:03.633
.
