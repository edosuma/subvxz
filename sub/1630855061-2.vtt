WEBVTT

00:06.131 --> 00:08.425
<i>We interrupt this static
with breaking news.</i>

00:09.884 --> 00:13.221
<i>Langley's arena football team,
the Bazooka Sharks, have announced</i>

00:13.221 --> 00:14.931
<i>they are leaving Langley Falls.</i>

00:14.931 --> 00:16.141
No.

00:16.141 --> 00:19.894
I poured so much love into the Sharks.
What will I do now?

00:19.894 --> 00:22.063
No, no, no!

00:22.063 --> 00:25.108
We must do something.
We must write a rap.

00:25.900 --> 00:27.235
Out of my way, babe.

00:27.235 --> 00:29.988
I gotta write a rap
to save the Bazooka Sharks.

00:30.155 --> 00:32.198
Cool beans, babe. I'm off to class.

00:32.198 --> 00:33.992
See you dicklicks later.

00:33.992 --> 00:37.162
Wait a minute. Why are you so happy?
You hate school.

00:37.162 --> 00:41.166
I used to, but I have this new
creative writing professor,

00:41.166 --> 00:43.835
and he is so inspiring.

00:43.835 --> 00:46.379
It's like he lit a fire inside me.

00:46.379 --> 00:48.631
- They're banging, right?
- For sure.

00:48.631 --> 00:49.716
That or it's Roger.

00:53.720 --> 00:57.057
Well, I'm off to shape
the soft clay minds of our youth.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.349
Told you it was Roger.

00:58.349 --> 01:00.185
I'll see you in class, Hayley.

01:00.935 --> 01:05.023
Your inspiring professor is Roger?
Are you serious?

01:05.023 --> 01:08.860
I was skeptical too. But there's
something different about this persona.

01:08.860 --> 01:12.697
He's passionate and engaged.
You know, it sounds crazy,

01:12.697 --> 01:16.409
but I think Roger is his best self
when he's Professor Longbottom.

01:16.409 --> 01:18.286
Hey, is Mom okay?

01:19.329 --> 01:22.332
She's just bugging out
because the Sharks are leaving town.

01:22.332 --> 01:25.418
Oh, wait, I think her twitch
is saying something in Morse code.

01:25.919 --> 01:29.422
Never... gonna...

01:29.422 --> 01:31.091
give you up?

01:38.556 --> 01:41.476
<i>Good morning, USA</i>

01:41.476 --> 01:44.979
<i>I got a feeling
That it's gonna be a wonderful day</i>

01:44.979 --> 01:48.024
<i>The sun in the sky
Has a smile on his face</i>

01:48.024 --> 01:51.694
<i>And he's shining a salute
To the American race</i>

01:54.531 --> 01:56.991
<i>Oh, boy, it's swell to say</i>

01:58.326 --> 02:01.037
I can't make you crash today, Stan.
I've got class.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.166
Football, huh?

02:05.166 --> 02:07.752
Well, I was only going to work
to hit the flagpole.

02:11.256 --> 02:14.384
Does anyone know why
we're having class outside today?

02:15.009 --> 02:16.845
What does every classroom have?

02:16.845 --> 02:18.346
- Desks.
- A pet hamster?

02:18.346 --> 02:20.348
Posters of Abraham Lincoln.

02:20.348 --> 02:23.184
Correct. But also completely wrong.

02:23.184 --> 02:26.646
The correct answer
I'm looking for is "walls."

02:26.646 --> 02:28.398
Ah!

02:28.523 --> 02:29.732
I hate walls.

02:29.732 --> 02:34.279
Walls are the physical manifestation
of the walls we put up inside our minds

02:34.279 --> 02:36.656
that stop us from becoming writers.

02:36.656 --> 02:38.533
Me, writers?

02:38.533 --> 02:41.035
I'd like to talk today
about Old Faithful,

02:41.035 --> 02:42.745
the geyser in Wyoming.

02:42.745 --> 02:45.498
Old Faithful fills with boiling water,

02:45.498 --> 02:48.835
the same way your mind fills
with ideas for writing.

02:49.335 --> 02:52.755
Like Old Faithful,
you have to erupt onto the page.

02:52.755 --> 02:53.965
Speaking of erupting,

02:53.965 --> 02:56.801
Hayley Smith is getting
her short story published

02:56.801 --> 02:58.428
in Groff's literary zine.

02:58.428 --> 03:00.221
I got into <i>Soul Puddles?</i>

03:00.221 --> 03:04.642
Yes. Your piece, <i>An Alien in My Attic,</i>
will be out Friday.

03:04.642 --> 03:08.646
An irresponsible story to write,
but I am very, very proud of you.

03:08.646 --> 03:11.065
Damn. Professor LB loves you.

03:11.774 --> 03:14.485
I can't get over
what a good teacher you are.

03:14.485 --> 03:16.070
And I can't get over the fact

03:16.070 --> 03:18.865
that I'm riding a bike this speed
and not falling over.

03:18.865 --> 03:20.200
You walk slow.

03:20.950 --> 03:22.619
Dad? What are you doing here?

03:22.619 --> 03:25.246
I found something
to replace the Bazooka Sharks.

03:25.246 --> 03:27.540
I'm a Groff football booster now.

03:27.540 --> 03:30.084
Hey, we're all doing Groff stuff.
That's great.

03:30.084 --> 03:33.504
It would be, except the team
hasn't won a game in three years.

03:33.504 --> 03:35.423
We need a new offensive line.

03:35.423 --> 03:38.843
Hey, isn't Steve always
hanging around with a big boy?

03:38.843 --> 03:40.011
I gotta go.

03:40.011 --> 03:41.971
Stan in a polo shirt.

03:41.971 --> 03:45.433
His gut sticks out,
but his arms look like pythons.

03:45.433 --> 03:47.268
Break some off for me.

03:48.519 --> 03:50.146
Not that I would. He's family.

03:57.403 --> 03:59.113
Roger, I want to say thank you.

03:59.113 --> 04:02.533
Your inspiration gave me the courage
to write that story.

04:02.533 --> 04:04.827
I just did what
any great professor does.

04:04.827 --> 04:07.664
Nurse a red wine hangover
while pretending to care about

04:07.664 --> 04:10.041
whatever my hottest student
was talking about.

04:10.041 --> 04:11.960
Not you, obviously. You're family.

04:13.169 --> 04:16.422
<i>Old Faithful,</i> a novel
by Dickens Longbottom.

04:16.422 --> 04:18.508
- You're writing a novel?
- It's nothing.

04:18.508 --> 04:21.844
Just your basic sci-fi noir,
with elements of dark fantasy

04:21.844 --> 04:24.389
and staged realism
centered around Old Faithful.

04:24.389 --> 04:26.432
- Can I read it?
- Not till it's finished.

04:26.432 --> 04:28.393
I'm having trouble with the ending.

04:28.393 --> 04:29.644
And middle.

04:29.644 --> 04:32.647
The beginning has been pretty elusive.
Writing is hard.

04:32.647 --> 04:36.401
Well, maybe I can be your writing buddy.
Help keep you on task.

04:36.401 --> 04:39.362
Support your writing
the way you supported mine.

04:39.362 --> 04:41.781
I was incredibly helpful to you.

04:41.781 --> 04:44.075
Okay, let's meet tomorrow
at the coffee shop.

04:44.075 --> 04:45.410
I like to write in public

04:45.410 --> 04:47.578
so other people
can see that I'm writing.

04:47.578 --> 04:49.872
It's a very important
part of my process.

04:53.710 --> 04:56.546
Hey, Mr. Smith. Are you here
to have sex with my parents?

04:56.546 --> 04:58.214
If that's what you want, Barry.

04:58.214 --> 05:00.758
Because from now on,
you get everything you want.

05:00.758 --> 05:04.721
Because I'm recruiting you to play
football at Groff Community College.

05:04.721 --> 05:06.347
I'm in ninth grade.

05:06.347 --> 05:09.517
And that's why community college
is the perfect place for you.

05:09.517 --> 05:11.769
Let's go for a drive.
We'll take your car.

05:11.769 --> 05:13.313
I don't have a car.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.898
Then whose keys to a seven-year-old SUV

05:15.898 --> 05:19.360
with 120,000 miles on it are these?

05:20.069 --> 05:21.487
You like prostitutes, Barry?

05:24.824 --> 05:27.535
Okay, Roger. Let's write that book.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.331
What is it?

05:31.331 --> 05:34.042
It's just that table seems
a lot better for writing.

05:34.042 --> 05:36.586
But that's the only other table
with people at it.

05:36.586 --> 05:38.921
Must be writers too. Show-offs.

05:38.921 --> 05:40.506
Wait, I think they're leaving.

05:41.215 --> 05:43.343
They're not leaving, but maybe soon.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.094
No rush. I'm a writer too.

05:47.555 --> 05:50.391
They sure didn't like me
flicking their ears like that.

05:50.391 --> 05:51.726
Okay, time to write.

05:52.894 --> 05:55.063
This computer feels a little small.

05:55.813 --> 05:57.774
Look at this behemoth.

05:57.774 --> 06:00.485
This is a computer. I'm ready.

06:01.486 --> 06:03.363
- My chair is too low.
- Ugh.

06:05.239 --> 06:06.741
You got a really nice lap.

06:09.786 --> 06:12.955
I'm starting to think
this computer might be too big.

06:12.955 --> 06:14.749
Roger, what's going on?

06:14.749 --> 06:16.751
Do you even want to finish this novel?

06:16.751 --> 06:19.045
Of course. But I'm afraid.

06:19.045 --> 06:21.214
What if it's not universally beloved?

06:21.214 --> 06:23.174
What if it's merely a cult classic?

06:23.174 --> 06:25.676
You have to power through that fear.
Dive in.

06:25.676 --> 06:27.929
- Dive on in.
- And just write.

06:27.929 --> 06:29.972
You're right. Let's do this.

06:39.315 --> 06:42.193
Listen to me clacking away, Hayley.
I'm writing.

06:43.444 --> 06:46.280
I can't focus with this noise.
What's happening?

06:46.280 --> 06:48.366
If anyone is wondering what's happening,

06:48.366 --> 06:51.744
the dean is having a pep rally
to announce our new football coach.

06:51.744 --> 06:52.829
Woo!

06:53.371 --> 06:55.206
I mean, we've got to check that out.

06:55.206 --> 06:56.290
Do we?

06:56.290 --> 06:59.377
Welcome. I'm Dean Barkov.

07:00.545 --> 07:04.966
Oh, yeah, that's a sick reaction.

07:04.966 --> 07:08.594
I'd like to introduce
our new football coach.

07:08.594 --> 07:12.682
Please welcome Burton Grundy.

07:12.682 --> 07:14.934
Whoa! Burton Grundy?

07:14.934 --> 07:17.895
The God-fearing family man
who treats his players

07:17.895 --> 07:20.273
with respect and wins wherever he goes.

07:20.273 --> 07:21.983
How do you know so much about...

07:22.650 --> 07:24.068
This better not be you.

07:24.068 --> 07:27.321
Plus, check out this unique specific.
He never curses.

07:27.321 --> 07:28.614
Just go.

07:30.700 --> 07:33.327
I'd like to thank you
for welcoming me to Groff.

07:33.327 --> 07:36.205
Me and my Christian wife
have prayed for this day.

07:36.205 --> 07:39.667
And I promise you,
I will stop at Jiminy Glick-ing nothing

07:39.667 --> 07:41.127
to win a championship.

07:44.005 --> 07:46.382
I avoided COVID for three years,

07:46.549 --> 07:50.887
and now I've caught writer's block
and football fever on the same day.

07:52.597 --> 07:54.432
Oh, nevermind. I have COVID.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.856
- Hey, can I talk to you?
- Sure.

08:01.856 --> 08:04.609
I can take a break from turning losers
into champions.

08:04.609 --> 08:06.903
Roger, I'm worried that Coach Grundy

08:06.903 --> 08:09.572
is just a distraction to keep you
from writing your book.

08:09.572 --> 08:12.992
Coach Grundy is not
a distraction, Hayley. Listen.

08:13.117 --> 08:15.077
Inside everyone, there are two sides.

08:15.077 --> 08:17.371
A coach and a professor.

08:17.371 --> 08:20.958
Like an offense and a defense,
they share the field and...

08:20.958 --> 08:23.377
Honestly, I'm not sure
where this analogy goes.

08:23.377 --> 08:25.630
I'm too distracted
by these super-squeaky markers.

08:26.756 --> 08:30.593
So, Professor Longbottom is still going
to buckle down and write this thing?

08:30.718 --> 08:33.596
He needs to share his unique voice
with the world.

08:33.721 --> 08:36.766
Yes.

08:36.766 --> 08:37.934
Now, if you'll excuse me,

08:37.934 --> 08:40.603
I've got some young boys
to turn into men.

08:40.603 --> 08:44.941
That sounds sexual but in this case,
this one particular case, it's not.

08:45.441 --> 08:47.026
This field.

08:47.026 --> 08:50.071
This field is where you'll bleed
with your brothers.

08:50.071 --> 08:52.031
Did you say "bleed"?

08:52.031 --> 08:53.157
I did.

08:53.157 --> 08:56.285
Barry, you may have also heard me
say the word "brothers."

08:56.285 --> 08:58.246
That's because football is a family.

08:58.246 --> 09:00.206
I already have a family.

09:00.206 --> 09:03.292
Parents aren't a family, Barry.
They're a distraction.

09:03.292 --> 09:04.377
Close your eyes.

09:04.377 --> 09:09.006
Imagine thousands, nay, hundreds of fans
chanting your name.

09:10.007 --> 09:14.053
Barry! Barry! Barry! Barry!

09:15.304 --> 09:16.305
You in or what?

09:17.640 --> 09:19.141
Check it out. Wheelie!

09:19.141 --> 09:22.562
Hey, it's been two weeks
since your last writing session.

09:23.062 --> 09:26.023
Yeah, football season has been
making it tough to find time,

09:26.023 --> 09:28.943
mainly because I'm going to a ton
of the practices and games.

09:28.943 --> 09:30.486
Are you sure about this

09:30.486 --> 09:32.822
"professor and a coach
inside all of us" theory?

09:32.822 --> 09:33.990
Never heard that one.

09:33.990 --> 09:35.825
But we're right by the coffee shop,

09:35.825 --> 09:38.411
the one place in the world
where I'm able to write.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.371
Want to stop in, bang out some pages?

09:40.371 --> 09:43.291
Sounds... Grundy's Chophouse?

09:44.083 --> 09:45.876
What happened to the coffee shop?

09:48.504 --> 09:51.507
Any time I take a job
in a new city, I open a Grundy's.

09:51.507 --> 09:53.175
It's a place for me to get plastered

09:53.175 --> 09:55.720
away from the prying eyes
of my Christian wife.

09:55.720 --> 09:58.139
Plus, it's a great way to bilk
a little extra money

09:58.139 --> 09:59.473
off any local rubes.

09:59.473 --> 10:00.600
Hayley!

10:01.475 --> 10:03.644
I didn't know you grubbed at Grundy's.

10:03.644 --> 10:07.315
I came here to help Professor Longbottom
do some writing, but...

10:07.315 --> 10:10.318
I told you not to take Roger seriously.

10:10.318 --> 10:14.030
Professor Longbottom is
Roger's sensitive side, and it's real.

10:14.572 --> 10:17.950
He's just manifesting Coach Grundy
to protect himself from failing.

10:18.451 --> 10:19.744
I need to get rid of him.

10:19.744 --> 10:22.830
Listen. I've followed
Grundy's entire career.

10:22.997 --> 10:27.418
If Longbottom is the best of Roger,
Grundy is the absolute worst.

10:28.294 --> 10:31.505
Oh, baby, I love how much
you're not my wife.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.468
He goes through a cycle.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.928
He comes to town,
gets into some scandal.

10:38.054 --> 10:41.974
Then he steps away from football
to "focus on family."

10:42.224 --> 10:44.018
It usually takes a couple seasons.

10:44.018 --> 10:46.687
Hmm. Maybe I could speed up the process.

10:47.271 --> 10:50.316
My actions have no consequences!

10:57.573 --> 10:58.699
Barry!

11:01.285 --> 11:02.286
You!

11:02.620 --> 11:04.705
How would you like to play
Groff football

11:04.705 --> 11:06.207
and have a family for life?

11:06.207 --> 11:09.210
Please, help Barry.

11:10.169 --> 11:11.837
What's your take on prostitutes?

11:12.672 --> 11:15.132
One week following Coach Grundy around,

11:15.132 --> 11:18.010
and I've got enough dirt
to take him down for good.

11:18.803 --> 11:20.471
Here. Play this on the Jumbotron.

11:21.722 --> 11:23.307
Hey, I'm talking to you.

11:25.017 --> 11:27.186
He was a balloon!

11:30.106 --> 11:31.107
<i>Groff fans.</i>

11:31.107 --> 11:35.778
<i>You probably know me as Hayley Smith,
recently published in</i> Soul Puddles.

11:37.363 --> 11:40.700
<i>Thank you. But I'm not here
to talk about my accomplishments.</i>

11:40.825 --> 11:43.703
<i>I'm here to show you
the real Coach Grundy.</i>

11:43.994 --> 11:46.163
<i>This'll teach you to stop fumbling.</i>

11:47.873 --> 11:51.544
<i>Oh, shit! Shit! That douchebag
Dean Barkov is eating at table four.</i>

11:51.669 --> 11:54.755
<i>I'm going to slap my schlong
on his New York strip real quick.</i>

11:57.425 --> 12:01.178
<i>Ecstasy for you. Ecstasy for you.
Ecstasy for you.</i>

12:01.178 --> 12:03.931
<i>Lithium for you, Terry,
you have problems. And...</i>

12:03.931 --> 12:05.975
<i>Ecstasy and lithium for me.</i>

12:06.642 --> 12:09.270
<i>Now, who wants sex
from a football coach?</i>

12:14.024 --> 12:15.067
Groff fans,

12:15.067 --> 12:19.780
since this video came out, my family
and I have been in constant prayer.

12:19.780 --> 12:21.532
And we've decided that I am going

12:21.532 --> 12:24.493
to step away from football
to focus on what's important.

12:24.493 --> 12:25.578
Family.

12:26.912 --> 12:29.248
But don't worry, I will be back...

12:29.790 --> 12:31.083
for the third quarter.

12:31.083 --> 12:32.668
Y'all have the Gatorade ready,

12:32.668 --> 12:35.671
'cause I'm winning
this Jiminy Glick-ing game.

12:44.013 --> 12:45.222
Hayley. There you are.

12:45.222 --> 12:47.600
I want you to know
I'm leaving the university.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.686
It's like the whole school is obsessed
with football,

12:50.686 --> 12:51.979
including me!

12:51.979 --> 12:53.606
I'll never finish my book.

12:53.606 --> 12:56.317
But the only thing stopping you
is you, like...

12:56.317 --> 12:58.110
Like, literally you.

12:58.110 --> 13:01.572
Roger, don't you see
that Grundy is just a wall

13:01.572 --> 13:04.658
you're putting up between you
and your fear of rejection?

13:04.658 --> 13:08.412
Mr. Longbottom, tear down this wall.

13:08.412 --> 13:10.831
Terrible Reagan, Hayley.
Absolutely brutal.

13:10.831 --> 13:12.917
But how am I supposed to finish my book?

13:12.917 --> 13:14.627
You're a writer.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.254
All you need is pen and paper.

13:17.254 --> 13:19.340
- And Adderall?
- Of course, Adderall.

13:19.340 --> 13:20.841
You're not a magician.

13:54.416 --> 13:58.587
I'd like to thank you all for joining me
to celebrate the release of my book.

13:58.587 --> 14:00.548
After spending years writing it,

14:00.548 --> 14:04.677
I feel fortunate to have gotten it
published immediately upon completion.

14:04.677 --> 14:09.181
Luckily, I'm acquainted with famed
publisher Roger T. Publishing Persona.

14:10.599 --> 14:11.976
First reviews are in.

14:13.561 --> 14:17.356
Is there a good way to interpret
the phrase "literary abortion"?

14:17.356 --> 14:20.025
- It's just one review.
- This is your fault!

14:20.025 --> 14:22.820
You made me expose myself
to the whole world,

14:22.820 --> 14:25.114
which is something
I ordinarily enjoy doing,

14:25.114 --> 14:26.407
but not in this case.

14:26.407 --> 14:28.409
Not in this one particular case.

14:36.500 --> 14:39.295
Roger, it's been weeks.
Can I talk to Longbottom?

14:39.295 --> 14:41.297
You can't. He's gone for good.

14:41.297 --> 14:44.550
You think he'd show his face
after that embarrassment of a book?

14:44.550 --> 14:47.386
It wasn't even that many pages.
Not like my book.

14:47.386 --> 14:49.972
It's half memoir,
half chophouse recipe book,

14:49.972 --> 14:51.473
and half football playbook.

14:51.473 --> 14:53.893
This thing's heavy as .
Just try and catch it.

14:55.019 --> 14:57.646
Mmm. Nice hands.
But could you do it over the middle

14:57.646 --> 15:00.983
with a linebacker bearing down on you
ready to take your head off?

15:01.358 --> 15:02.610
I bet you could.

15:05.613 --> 15:06.989
I'm worried about Roger.

15:06.989 --> 15:10.618
He hasn't been anybody but that
stupid football coach for weeks.

15:10.618 --> 15:13.871
He said he was going full Grundy.
No other personas.

15:13.871 --> 15:16.749
Well, that's bad news.
He came into my room this morning

15:16.749 --> 15:19.168
and said I had to wake up
for two-a-days.

15:19.168 --> 15:22.004
And the only thing I want to do
twice a day is whack it.

15:22.004 --> 15:23.964
- You know what I mean?
- Nice.

15:23.964 --> 15:27.343
- Ew.
- I mean, ew!

15:27.343 --> 15:31.096
This is my fault.
I convinced Roger to take a risk.

15:31.096 --> 15:34.642
He got hurt, and now he'll never let
the good part of himself out again.

15:34.642 --> 15:35.726
You're crazy.

15:35.726 --> 15:38.520
He let the good part of himself out
all over this book.

15:38.687 --> 15:41.815
Ooh! <i>Old Faithful.</i>
This is my all-time favorite play.

15:41.815 --> 15:43.859
He has a play called <i>Old Faithful?</i>

15:44.443 --> 15:45.444
Klaus, look at this.

15:45.444 --> 15:48.280
The receiver runs out of bounds
and onto the next page.

15:48.280 --> 15:52.117
A recipe for Wyoming-style potato skins.

15:52.117 --> 15:55.663
Do you think Longbottom
is somewhere inside Roger,

15:55.663 --> 15:57.957
leaving clues wanting us to find him?

15:57.957 --> 15:59.166
That's crazy, Hayley.

15:59.833 --> 16:04.463
But devil's advocate,
do you think this could be anything?

16:04.463 --> 16:07.549
Professor Longbottom is at Old Faithful.

16:07.549 --> 16:11.136
I'm not saying you're right,
but if you are, I better come with you.

16:12.262 --> 16:13.639
<i>Chapter six.</i>

16:13.639 --> 16:17.017
<i>We were down 21-7 to Lanceton
and we were cooked,</i>

16:17.017 --> 16:19.812
<i>just like my famous
Grundy's Chophouse wings,</i>

16:19.812 --> 16:24.191
<i>available in piles of 25, 75, or 175.</i>

16:24.191 --> 16:26.402
<i>Return the bones for discounted drinks.</i>

16:26.402 --> 16:28.362
<i>Please stop taking the bones home.</i>

16:28.362 --> 16:31.031
Roger, why is so much of Grundy's book
about chicken bones?

16:31.031 --> 16:33.075
They're buying the meat,
not the bones.

16:34.785 --> 16:39.039
I, uh, need to run ahead because...
I have to pee?

16:39.039 --> 16:40.499
Yes. Yes. Good enough.

16:43.877 --> 16:46.005
Hayley, my prized pupil.

16:48.465 --> 16:51.135
Roger, I came to bring
the professor home.

16:51.135 --> 16:52.678
Why would you wanna do that?

16:52.678 --> 16:56.181
Professor Longbottom is
a passionate, inspiring soul.

16:56.181 --> 16:58.475
Grundy is just trying
to hold you inside,

16:58.475 --> 17:02.062
- but you need to burst out like...
- Old Faithful.

17:05.065 --> 17:07.234
You led me right to him.

17:07.234 --> 17:10.404
Wait, what's happening?
I led you to you?

17:10.404 --> 17:13.073
And now it's time
for the old ether-cut-to-black.

17:19.163 --> 17:20.497
Oh, good, you're awake.

17:20.497 --> 17:22.082
Roger, what's going on?

17:22.082 --> 17:24.585
We're both gonna die
when this geyser erupts.

17:24.585 --> 17:26.670
What? Why are you doing this?

17:26.670 --> 17:30.257
It's not me, it's Grundy.
I'm Roger's vulnerable side.

17:30.257 --> 17:34.595
As long as I exist, being all weak
and shit, his feelings can get hurt.

17:34.595 --> 17:37.806
This is stupid. Klaus was right.
You're a maniac. Untie me.

17:37.806 --> 17:41.769
I can't. I'm just as tied up as you.
Grundy is at the cabin now.

17:41.769 --> 17:46.565
He's gonna burn it down, along with all
the many, many unsold copies of my book.

17:46.565 --> 17:47.941
I'll be erased forever.

17:47.941 --> 17:50.027
You're at the cabin right now.

17:50.027 --> 17:52.488
Hayley, you know what I mean. It's over.

17:52.488 --> 17:54.490
There's nothing we can do to stop him.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.492
Okay, I should get going.

17:57.826 --> 17:59.328
Don't leave me here alone.

17:59.912 --> 18:02.331
You're not alone.
You're with the professor.

18:03.624 --> 18:04.917
S'up, dude?

18:11.757 --> 18:13.842
"They called her Old Faithful,

18:13.842 --> 18:18.263
"but me, I was young
and couldn't be faithful for a second."

18:18.889 --> 18:19.890
Yikes.

18:23.477 --> 18:25.646
As soon as I sign this contract,

18:25.646 --> 18:28.190
the Bazooka Sharks will officially be
moving to Ottawa.

18:28.190 --> 18:30.109
Don't sign that paper.

18:30.109 --> 18:33.153
Maybe you forgot,
but I've been writing a rap.

18:40.619 --> 18:42.538
<i>Before you move the 'Zooka Sharks</i>

18:43.122 --> 18:45.165
<i>Jeff Fischer's got a few remarks</i>

18:46.041 --> 18:48.127
<i>The Sharks belong in Langley</i>

18:48.460 --> 18:50.587
<i>Where they got mad history</i>

18:51.463 --> 18:53.507
<i>Like the time we lost by 63</i>

18:54.007 --> 18:55.759
<i>An all-time Sharks memory</i>

18:55.759 --> 18:57.094
<i>'Zooka 'Zooka Sharks</i>

18:57.094 --> 18:58.595
<i>'Zooka Sharks</i>

19:01.723 --> 19:02.724

19:12.734 --> 19:15.737
<i>There's just one more reason
to keep the sharks in Langley</i>

19:15.737 --> 19:18.991
<i>Let the memory of that little girl
who died in the stands</i>

19:18.991 --> 19:23.370
<i>RIP always and forever
Our youngest fan</i>

19:34.965 --> 19:36.175
<i>'Zooka Sharks</i>

19:43.807 --> 19:46.560
<i>Don't tarnish the legacy
of Johnny Concussion</i>

19:46.560 --> 19:48.520
<i>Sharks all-time leader in rushin'</i>

19:48.520 --> 19:51.857
<i>- Thirty yards!
- So move the Sharks at your discretion</i>

19:51.857 --> 19:54.151
<i>But if you do, I'mma send you to heaven</i>

19:54.151 --> 19:55.861
<i>Introduce your ass to God</i>

19:56.195 --> 19:59.072
<i>Rest in peace, Lisa Jenkis</i>

20:01.950 --> 20:03.827
Who cares about money?

20:03.827 --> 20:07.372
The Sharks belong in Langley Falls!

20:09.208 --> 20:12.502
You did it, Jeff. You saved the Sharks!

20:13.128 --> 20:16.965
By the way, whoever put me
in an adult diaper, thank you.

20:22.679 --> 20:24.723
Don't worry.
I'm gonna get you out of there.

20:24.723 --> 20:26.934
- Great!
- Starting with the professor.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.061
What?

20:29.728 --> 20:31.813
Ah! Ahhh!

20:31.980 --> 20:33.023
Roger!

20:33.023 --> 20:35.025
Oh, fine. You're such a baby.

20:40.614 --> 20:43.033
- What the hell changed your mind?
- This book.

20:43.033 --> 20:44.660
I read it and loved it.

20:44.660 --> 20:48.372
And I realized if a piece of art
touches even one person,

20:48.372 --> 20:49.957
it's worthwhile.

20:50.123 --> 20:51.750
And it did touch one person.

20:52.334 --> 20:54.878
Me. I touched myself, Hayley.

20:56.046 --> 20:58.298
- Jiminy Glick.
- Hayley, wait.

20:58.298 --> 21:01.718
Just so you know, I was the professor
and the coach the whole time.
