00:01.929 --> 00:02.939
Previously on Angel:

00:03.729 --> 00:07.379
I've done things, questionable things.
You're all fired.

00:07.929 --> 00:09.300
Officer, wait!

00:15.250 --> 00:17.039
- What are you?
- A vampire.

00:17.649 --> 00:20.629
It's called a moment
of clarity, You've just had one,

00:21.250 --> 00:23.640
You might not be able to fix this.

00:24.250 --> 00:25.789
- Angel.
- You okay?

00:26.050 --> 00:27.350
No.

00:27.850 --> 00:29.390
Sorry.
I wanna work for you.

00:29.649 --> 00:31.929
How do we know we can trust you?

00:36.850 --> 00:38.670
This won't be easy, Angel,

00:39.250 --> 00:41.390
You have to change your behavior,

00:41.649 --> 00:45.759
Engage your coworkers. Be sensitive
to their feelings and opinions.

00:46.450 --> 00:49.219
Especially before you
take some action...

00:50.049 --> 00:52.329
...one might construe as--
Let's say, insane.

00:52.450 --> 00:56.350
It goes a long way to show you
appreciate and respect them.

00:57.850 --> 01:00.020
- This is torture, isn't it?
- Yes.

01:00.850 --> 01:01.829
Good.

01:03.250 --> 01:04.120
That's all.

01:04.450 --> 01:07.680
I'll just, you know,
sit and absorb it all.

01:12.250 --> 01:15.019
Somewhere else. Not here.
I mean, this is...

01:16.450 --> 01:18.700
...your office now.

01:19.450 --> 01:22.010
I'll just-- I'll get out of your hair.

01:22.450 --> 01:24.730
- You're sure about this?
- Absolutely.

01:25.450 --> 01:27.480
I work for you. I just need to--

01:30.250 --> 01:33.549
I've provided you
with a new working space.

01:35.650 --> 01:37.819
- Great.
- And I'd love a cup of coffee.

01:38.650 --> 01:40.900
That's very funny.

01:42.250 --> 01:43.579
Two sugars in mine.

01:44.049 --> 01:45.769
Mocha cappuccino here.

01:47.650 --> 01:50.180
Man, atonement's a bitch.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:31.930 --> 03:33.189
- Don't.
- Don't?

03:33.729 --> 03:37.060
You're gonna try to make
small talk, get all stammery.

03:37.330 --> 03:38.800
You might strain yourself.

03:40.930 --> 03:42.930
Just wanted to know how you were.

03:43.330 --> 03:46.000
I mean, we really haven't
had a chance--

03:46.330 --> 03:47.490
- Let me--
- It's okay.

03:48.129 --> 03:49.500
- I can--
- I've got it.

03:54.729 --> 03:55.849
Okay.

03:57.729 --> 03:59.340
You want to know how I am?

04:01.330 --> 04:05.159
Tired, mostly, with sweaty
running a close second.

04:06.129 --> 04:07.210
I'm also jazzed.

04:07.930 --> 04:10.030
Can't wait to start business again.

04:10.930 --> 04:12.439
Ready to help the helpless.

04:14.530 --> 04:18.009
But just so we understand each other,
you and I...

04:21.730 --> 04:23.269
...we're not friends.

04:39.810 --> 04:40.930
Wesley!

04:49.410 --> 04:52.009
She's screaming.
Pulling her from a car.

04:53.009 --> 04:54.379
Guys in blue robes.

04:58.410 --> 04:59.459
They're...

04:59.610 --> 05:03.329
...taking people and--

05:04.410 --> 05:05.279
Whoa.

05:06.209 --> 05:07.720
- Big bird.
- Big Bird?

05:07.529 --> 05:09.000
Not the Muppet, dumbass.

05:10.529 --> 05:12.389
Where's the car, Cordelia?

05:14.129 --> 05:15.920
Lafayette Park, the fountain.

05:15.930 --> 05:17.120
Right. Let's move.

05:18.930 --> 05:19.910
- Are you--?
- Fine.

05:20.730 --> 05:21.990
You should take off.

05:24.329 --> 05:27.769
I mean, the rest of the night.
Go home.

05:31.529 --> 05:32.790
Order Chinese.

05:57.370 --> 05:58.350
Hello?

06:00.970 --> 06:02.199
Hello?

06:06.970 --> 06:08.860
That's how you greet a friend?

06:10.569 --> 06:13.339
Harmony? Harmony, I don't believe it!

06:14.170 --> 06:16.800
- Yes. It's me.
- I haven't seen you since--

06:17.170 --> 06:20.399
- Our school blew up.
- Seems like a lifetime ago.

06:20.769 --> 06:22.629
Oh, for me too. Totally.

06:23.769 --> 06:25.730
Wow. Look at you.

06:26.769 --> 06:27.750
You look...

06:28.569 --> 06:29.269
...different.

06:29.769 --> 06:32.720
I'm not the same as I was
back at Sunnydale High.

06:34.569 --> 06:36.250
And you. You...

06:38.170 --> 06:38.939
...cut your hair.

06:38.769 --> 06:40.449
Oh. Yeah.

06:41.170 --> 06:43.839
I think it looks adorable,
off your neck.

06:44.769 --> 06:48.629
Thanks. I was just, you know,
looking for a change.

06:49.569 --> 06:52.129
Sure. Change. Change is good.

06:52.569 --> 06:53.939
Sometimes.

06:54.970 --> 06:58.300
So, this is where you do...

06:59.170 --> 07:00.540
...whatever it is you do?

07:00.970 --> 07:04.589
- Detective agency.
- Right. But you're not a detective.

07:05.769 --> 07:06.819
Well, not me.

07:08.170 --> 07:09.850
Technically. I'm--

07:12.370 --> 07:15.110
Mostly I manage things. The office.

07:15.970 --> 07:17.509
Sounds rewarding.

07:18.970 --> 07:20.620
Are you in town on business?

07:21.370 --> 07:23.050
No. No business.

07:23.170 --> 07:24.889
Play, play, play.

07:27.970 --> 07:30.810
I just got out of
a smothering relationship.

07:31.569 --> 07:34.379
You know when they
can't live without you?

07:35.170 --> 07:36.430
Sure. That one.

07:38.170 --> 07:39.959
Hate that.

07:40.569 --> 07:43.800
I thought it would be a good time
to check out L.A.

07:44.170 --> 07:45.290
See old friends.

07:45.970 --> 07:48.569
- Got a place to stay?
- You offering?

07:48.970 --> 07:50.759
- Do I have to say it?
- Yeah.

07:51.370 --> 07:54.000
Stay with me. Hope you
don't mind the couch.

08:02.490 --> 08:03.649
Now what?

08:05.490 --> 08:07.839
Gunn, search the area
near the fountain.

08:08.490 --> 08:10.279
I'll take this path. Angel--

08:11.490 --> 08:13.350
Follow the screaming woman?

08:28.290 --> 08:30.779
Why you wanna hide
such a pretty face?

08:42.090 --> 08:44.899
It's over now. You'll be safe here.

08:45.690 --> 08:47.509
Didn't Cordelia say blue robes?

08:49.289 --> 08:50.590
Perhaps she was wrong.

08:51.090 --> 08:54.879
I think we should give her
the benefit of the doubt, don't you?

08:57.690 --> 09:00.779
I'll check. See if those
blue boys are still around.

09:04.889 --> 09:06.850
- Religious sect?
- I don't know.

09:07.289 --> 09:08.940
I'll put Cordelia onto it.

09:10.289 --> 09:13.200
- I gave her the night off.
- Did you?

09:14.490 --> 09:17.899
Well, I thought, you know,
she looked so tired--

09:18.090 --> 09:19.879
The vision got to her.

09:20.490 --> 09:24.039
Do you think I should send
her something? Like flowers?

09:24.690 --> 09:25.879
- Flowers?
- Yeah.

09:26.490 --> 09:30.110
To say, "Thanks.
I'm sorry about the migraines."

09:30.690 --> 09:33.009
You know, "I appreciate you."

09:34.289 --> 09:37.590
Yes. And while you're at it,
pick me up one of those...

09:37.889 --> 09:40.350
..."Sorry you were shot in the gut"
bouquets.

09:41.490 --> 09:43.700
Right. Sorry.

09:45.690 --> 09:47.940
You can't buy back her trust, Angel.

09:48.090 --> 09:49.809
Or her affections.

09:51.090 --> 09:52.279
She said--

09:54.090 --> 09:55.980
She said we're not friends.

10:00.090 --> 10:01.740
I know.

10:03.090 --> 10:07.159
There's only one thing you can
give her, Angel. That's time.

10:07.889 --> 10:09.500
She has a lot of pain.

10:11.210 --> 10:12.750
Oh, your cackle.

10:14.210 --> 10:15.580
And then, remember...

10:16.009 --> 10:19.769
...in ninth grade remedial Spanish,
Donnie something?

10:20.809 --> 10:22.000
Donnie Wray. Yes.

10:22.610 --> 10:26.090
That's him! He followed me everywhere.

10:26.809 --> 10:29.549
Oh, and he wrote that
love song to you.

10:29.809 --> 10:31.070
How did it go?

10:32.809 --> 10:35.830
Oh, Cordelia

10:36.409 --> 10:39.889
How I long to feel ya

10:44.210 --> 10:46.909
Oh, God. We totally ruled.

10:49.009 --> 10:50.309
Yeah. That we did.

10:50.809 --> 10:52.559
We were powerful...

10:53.210 --> 10:55.490
...rich, popular.

10:56.809 --> 10:58.840
None of that's changed for me.

10:59.809 --> 11:03.220
Apart from the powerful,
rich and popular.

11:04.009 --> 11:07.129
- But I am happier now than I was then.
- Get out.

11:07.610 --> 11:10.940
It's hard to explain.
I'm telling you, it's like--

11:11.809 --> 11:14.299
I had these air pockets inside of me.

11:15.409 --> 11:17.580
And the work I'm doing--

11:18.409 --> 11:22.690
We're doing, it's like
the pockets keep getting filled...

11:23.809 --> 11:25.600
...and I'm becoming me and--

11:28.610 --> 11:31.169
Me has had way too much to drink.

11:31.610 --> 11:33.399
And me shut up.

11:34.610 --> 11:37.590
You, now. You've barely
told me anything.

11:39.409 --> 11:41.690
Well, what can I say?

11:42.409 --> 11:44.899
Things are fabu. I'm having a ball.

11:45.409 --> 11:48.990
I did just get out of that
really unhealthy relationship.

11:49.610 --> 11:53.370
And just, you know, feeling
really good about me in general.

11:56.809 --> 11:58.350
Well, good for you.

11:59.210 --> 12:00.220
In general.

12:02.210 --> 12:05.899
Well, you must be doing something
right, because you look...

12:06.409 --> 12:08.059
...crampy.

12:08.809 --> 12:10.110
Are you okay?

12:11.210 --> 12:12.539
Yeah, just...

12:14.210 --> 12:16.350
...hungry, I guess.

12:16.610 --> 12:17.980
Got the cure for that.

12:19.610 --> 12:20.870
Pizza.

12:22.610 --> 12:24.889
I know just the place. My favorite.

12:25.610 --> 12:28.210
Thin crust. Heavy on the sauce.

12:28.610 --> 12:31.100
Do you like pineapple
and tandoori chicken?

12:31.610 --> 12:34.169
Oh, yeah. It's all good.

13:25.450 --> 13:26.679
I didn't do that.

13:27.250 --> 13:28.409
Harmony?

13:32.649 --> 13:34.509
I have a ghost.

13:36.850 --> 13:38.179
- What are--?
- Nothing.

13:39.250 --> 13:40.440
Harmony?

13:41.049 --> 13:44.950
I'm sorry. I thought
I could control myself.

13:47.049 --> 13:50.210
- I thought I could resist my urges.
- Urges?

13:50.649 --> 13:54.509
You have no idea how hard it is
to stay away from you.

13:54.850 --> 13:58.149
I mean, seeing you there, looking so...

14:00.250 --> 14:01.860
...luscious.

14:05.049 --> 14:07.889
- Oh, you're a--
- I should have told you.

14:09.250 --> 14:11.039
I was scared.

14:12.250 --> 14:16.110
Scared that if you found out
what I was, you'd kill me.

14:17.049 --> 14:19.220
Oh, no. Harmony.

14:19.450 --> 14:22.190
You really think
I'm that narrow-minded?

14:23.049 --> 14:24.519
I don't care about that.

14:26.049 --> 14:29.070
- You don't?
- No. Not as long as you're happy.

14:30.850 --> 14:32.710
Happy. What's that?

14:33.850 --> 14:36.970
The last time I was happy
was back in school with you.

14:39.250 --> 14:42.659
- Now, I'm taking advantage of you.
- No.

14:43.450 --> 14:45.519
It's just--

14:45.850 --> 14:49.179
It's just that I had no idea
that you...

14:51.250 --> 14:55.600
- ...thought of me that way.
- I don't, I swear. It's just--

14:56.049 --> 14:58.259
Well, I haven't had any
for a while--

15:00.250 --> 15:01.690
Forget it.

15:02.049 --> 15:05.559
This is stupid. I'll just
go back to the couch.

15:06.250 --> 15:08.419
I'm really sorry.

15:08.649 --> 15:11.809
Don't be. If you wanna
stay and talk--

15:12.850 --> 15:13.830
No, I better--

15:16.450 --> 15:20.419
You know, I'd appreciate it if you
didn't mention this to anyone.

15:21.850 --> 15:23.149
It's our secret.

15:25.649 --> 15:28.179
How come you didn't tell me
about Harmony?

15:28.649 --> 15:31.389
You couldn't afford
a little phone call?

15:32.250 --> 15:33.330
Harmony?

15:35.250 --> 15:36.620
What about Harmony?

15:37.049 --> 15:38.590
She's here, in L.A.

15:38.850 --> 15:42.539
Yikes. Big yikes. What happened?
Did she come after you?

15:43.049 --> 15:47.509
Yeah. She practically attacked me
in my bedroom last night.

15:48.450 --> 15:50.909
- Your bedroom?
- While I was sleeping,

15:51.450 --> 15:55.240
Good thing I woke up too. She was
ready to jump me right there.

15:56.250 --> 16:00.360
But I think she understood me
when I shot her down.

16:01.049 --> 16:02.980
- You wounded her?
- She'll survive.

16:03.450 --> 16:05.940
I shouldn't have invited her to stay.

16:06.450 --> 16:09.009
- Say what?
- Yeah, I know. Awkward much?

16:09.450 --> 16:10.360
Cordelia!

16:11.250 --> 16:14.940
We're all clear on the fact
that Harmony's a vampire, right?

16:17.850 --> 16:19.779
Harmony's a vampire?

16:20.850 --> 16:21.759
That's why--

16:22.649 --> 16:26.090
Oh, my God, I'm so embarrassed.

16:28.049 --> 16:31.029
All this time I thought she was
a great big lesbo.

16:34.049 --> 16:35.129
Oh, yeah?

16:35.850 --> 16:37.009
Really?

16:38.250 --> 16:40.669
Well, that's great. Good for you.

16:41.250 --> 16:42.440
Thanks for affirming.

16:43.049 --> 16:47.019
Cordelia, Harmony's very dangerous.
You have to get out of there.

16:47.850 --> 16:50.100
I'll call when I get somewhere safe.

16:50.850 --> 16:52.250
Where are you going?

16:55.330 --> 16:57.429
Maybe I can find the manufacturer.

16:57.730 --> 17:00.259
Already looked into it.
No listing anywhere.

17:00.730 --> 17:03.120
Maybe I'll find something
on the street.

17:03.730 --> 17:06.569
The street bathed in morning sunlight?

17:07.329 --> 17:09.720
Relax. Gunn's contacting his sources.

17:12.130 --> 17:14.549
- Well, what can I do?
- Answer that.

17:19.930 --> 17:21.329
Angel Invest--

17:21.730 --> 17:22.809
Willow?

17:24.130 --> 17:25.529
Willow, what--?

17:25.930 --> 17:27.539
Slow down. Hold on.

17:29.529 --> 17:31.039
Get away from her...

17:31.930 --> 17:32.910
...foot.

17:33.130 --> 17:35.230
- What are you doing?
- We're--

17:35.529 --> 17:36.970
Willow called and told us.

17:37.329 --> 17:40.279
- Your friend Harmony is a--
- Vampire. I know.

17:42.130 --> 17:45.039
- An evil vampire.
- Yeah, we covered that too.

17:49.329 --> 17:51.190
You thought you'd kill her...

17:51.130 --> 17:54.039
...without giving her a chance
to explain herself?

17:55.329 --> 17:56.700
- Pretty much.
- That's it.

17:57.130 --> 18:00.319
Holster your guns, boys.
She came to me for help.

18:02.529 --> 18:04.529
That's what we do, right? Help?

18:05.529 --> 18:09.920
That thing may have your friend's
memories, her appearances...

18:10.930 --> 18:13.839
...but it's a filthy demon,
an unholy monster.

18:15.730 --> 18:17.029
- No offense.
- About what?

18:18.730 --> 18:20.309
Wes, you can't.

18:20.529 --> 18:22.920
Cordelia feels her friend
isn't a threat.

18:23.529 --> 18:25.809
I think we should respect her wishes.

18:29.529 --> 18:31.039
I'm just saying.

18:33.730 --> 18:35.589
Cordelia, we need you.

18:38.529 --> 18:40.069
Let me get my coat.

18:43.329 --> 18:46.589
So you're just going to
leave her here?

18:46.930 --> 18:49.910
A vampire, risking your
neighbors' lives?

18:50.529 --> 18:54.009
Harmony's my friend,
and I trust her completely.

18:54.730 --> 18:55.960
Harmony can stay.

18:56.529 --> 18:58.920
I don't wanna be alone with the ghost.

19:01.769 --> 19:03.839
Triangles evoke
pyramidal imagery...

19:04.769 --> 19:08.319
...but there's nothing with both
a serpent and a pyramid.

19:10.769 --> 19:13.160
Doesn't appear to be--
Do you mind?

19:15.569 --> 19:17.990
Well, I'm kind of bored, but go ahead.

19:19.170 --> 19:20.849
The red bird sculpture you saw--

19:21.569 --> 19:24.130
Was it an eagle? A hawk? A falcon?

19:24.569 --> 19:26.359
Am I the Bird Lady of Alcatraz?

19:26.970 --> 19:31.150
It had wings and a beak. For all
I know, it was a big red duck.

19:31.769 --> 19:35.529
Perhaps it's an idol, a totem
the cult uses in its rituals for--

19:37.170 --> 19:38.779
Duck worshippers?

19:40.170 --> 19:42.980
It could be a landmark
at their hiding place.

19:43.170 --> 19:46.119
I'm unaware of any bird
statuary in downtown L.A.

19:46.769 --> 19:48.140
So unless you are--

19:48.569 --> 19:50.430
Put a stake through her heart...

19:50.970 --> 19:52.930
...if she persists in popping gum!

19:53.369 --> 19:55.160
Harmony, lose the gum.

19:55.769 --> 19:59.140
Sorry. I thought it would
help with the cravings.

20:01.170 --> 20:04.680
You'd think I'd get thanked
for not biting any of you.

20:05.369 --> 20:08.740
What are you doing?
This book is 12 centuries old!

20:08.970 --> 20:11.990
It's not like I messed up a new one.

20:14.970 --> 20:16.690
She didn't do it on purpose.

20:17.369 --> 20:18.349
That's right.

20:18.569 --> 20:21.480
And I could have
because, you know, I am evil.

20:24.569 --> 20:25.579
Wesley! Wesley!

20:25.769 --> 20:27.349
There's blood in here.

20:27.569 --> 20:29.920
Let's get you some
and let everyone work.

20:32.970 --> 20:34.930
Here you go. That's it.

20:35.970 --> 20:37.200
Drink up.

20:40.170 --> 20:41.079
Tastes funky.

20:41.970 --> 20:42.980
It's pig's blood.

20:43.170 --> 20:45.559
That's gonna go
straight to my hips.

20:47.970 --> 20:50.039
- How can you?
- You get used to it.

20:50.369 --> 20:52.789
I mean, how do you stand everything?

20:53.369 --> 20:57.789
Being what you are. How can you
deprive yourself of the taste?

20:58.769 --> 21:02.559
The sensation of rich,
warm, human blood...

21:03.569 --> 21:07.750
...flowing into your mouth?
Bathing your tongue...

21:08.369 --> 21:11.849
...caressing your throat
with its sweet, sticky--

21:12.569 --> 21:13.619
- I'm back.
- Me too.

21:18.569 --> 21:20.150
I see we have company.

21:24.569 --> 21:26.640
That's Harmony. She's visiting.

21:26.970 --> 21:30.450
It's okay to speak freely
in front of her. She's a vampire.

21:34.769 --> 21:36.980
- Don't we kill them?
- What did you find?

21:37.170 --> 21:39.980
Robed vampires been getting
people for a month.

21:40.769 --> 21:43.960
- Why didn't we know?
- We've been distracted lately.

21:44.369 --> 21:47.559
Or we haven't heard because
the bodies aren't turning up.

21:49.170 --> 21:51.240
They're turning them.

21:52.170 --> 21:53.039
Into vampires?

21:53.369 --> 21:55.119
They're building an army.

21:55.769 --> 21:57.660
Question is, for what?

21:59.849 --> 22:01.640
The time is here.

22:02.250 --> 22:03.859
The time is now.

22:04.650 --> 22:07.349
The question is, are you ready?

22:07.650 --> 22:09.930
I said, are you ready?!

22:10.650 --> 22:13.349
It's time. Take a seat.

22:14.849 --> 22:17.900
It's time to actualize your potential.

22:18.450 --> 22:20.450
Time to maximize your input...

22:21.450 --> 22:24.259
...and get the most
out of your afterlife.

22:24.450 --> 22:26.839
To those of you who are new,
I wanna say:

22:27.450 --> 22:28.609
Hi.

22:31.650 --> 22:33.160
You're special.

22:34.049 --> 22:36.890
You each have it in you
to be the best vampire.

22:37.650 --> 22:40.279
Not just any vampire, but a master.

22:40.650 --> 22:43.069
How? I'll show you.

22:44.849 --> 22:47.339
Through my personally devised
multi-level...

22:47.849 --> 22:50.170
...exponential flow co-operative.

22:50.849 --> 22:54.960
I know what some of you are saying,
"Hey, Doug, speak English, man."

22:55.650 --> 22:58.250
Okay, don't stake me, guys, all right?

22:59.849 --> 23:01.529
Here's how it works.

23:02.849 --> 23:06.220
One vampire turns two humans
into vampires.

23:08.250 --> 23:10.599
They each turn two more humans.

23:11.250 --> 23:13.210
And they turn two more.

23:13.650 --> 23:15.259
And so on, and so on.

23:16.049 --> 23:19.630
All it takes for each vampire
to buy their way...

23:20.849 --> 23:23.480
...into our co-op is one human,
to be deposited...

23:25.650 --> 23:27.509
...in our very own food bank.

23:31.049 --> 23:32.799
How about that, huh?

23:34.049 --> 23:36.150
You turn two into vampires...

23:36.450 --> 23:38.700
...and you bring one
for the food bank.

23:39.450 --> 23:42.500
Turn two, and the rest is food.
Say it.

23:43.049 --> 23:45.369
Turn two, the rest is food.

23:45.450 --> 23:47.519
Turn two, the rest is food!

23:48.450 --> 23:49.150
Next.

23:49.049 --> 23:52.490
Two students grabbed in a parking
garage on Figueroa.

23:53.250 --> 23:54.900
Got it. Next.

23:55.650 --> 23:58.809
- Guy snatched two blocks over.
- When was this?

23:59.849 --> 24:02.130
Last night. Heard it
from one of my guys.

24:04.049 --> 24:06.509
- What?
- Nothing. Just--

24:07.049 --> 24:09.220
I can't believe this
is what you do.

24:10.049 --> 24:13.000
We always said we'd do
something cool. Look at us.

24:13.650 --> 24:15.089
You work here, I'm dead.

24:15.450 --> 24:18.329
Life takes some funny turns sometimes.

24:19.650 --> 24:22.559
I'm not where I thought I'd be,
but still--

24:23.849 --> 24:26.339
Hey. Hello, guys?
Found something.

24:26.849 --> 24:28.880
There's nothing mystical
about it.

24:29.849 --> 24:33.400
Department of Justice.
A logo for a defunct pyramid scheme.

24:34.049 --> 24:36.049
Vamps running money scams now?

24:36.450 --> 24:40.240
This particular one was run
by a motivational speaker and--

24:41.250 --> 24:44.440
Oh, Lord, help me,
self-described "Life Coach"...

24:44.849 --> 24:46.920
...named Doug Sanders.

24:47.849 --> 24:50.480
Held meetings until
the feds caught him.

24:50.849 --> 24:54.109
- He was arrested?
- He disappeared. Still at large.

24:54.450 --> 24:57.569
- Has the makings of a cult leader.
- Here's something.

24:58.650 --> 25:00.329
His known meeting sites.

25:02.250 --> 25:03.549
- A picture!
- Now we're talking.

25:03.450 --> 25:05.099
Let me see.

25:08.849 --> 25:11.099
Okay, that was my fault.

25:11.250 --> 25:12.619
Get her out of here.

25:13.049 --> 25:14.099
Now.

25:14.849 --> 25:16.180
Come on, Harm.

25:17.250 --> 25:19.069
Such a fitting nickname.

25:20.849 --> 25:21.970
Bloody hell.

25:24.450 --> 25:26.799
This was a mistake.
I shouldn't have come.

25:27.450 --> 25:29.519
I'm just getting in the way.

25:29.849 --> 25:32.519
- Don't talk like that.
- Easy for you to say.

25:33.450 --> 25:35.309
You've got friends.

25:35.849 --> 25:38.690
I don't have anyone
who understands me.

25:43.049 --> 25:46.599
I know someone who understands
a little about pain.

25:48.450 --> 25:49.779
We're going out!

25:58.730 --> 26:01.849
Memories

26:02.930 --> 26:07.529
May be beautiful and yet

26:10.730 --> 26:14.940
What's too painful to remember

26:22.130 --> 26:25.500
So, what do you think?

26:25.730 --> 26:28.569
Your friend should reconsider
the name Harmony.

26:30.529 --> 26:34.710
The way we were

26:37.130 --> 26:40.750
The way we were

26:49.130 --> 26:52.569
That was so fun!
I can't believe I did that.

26:53.329 --> 26:55.049
Color us incredulous.

26:55.730 --> 26:57.519
Harmony's looking for guidance.

26:57.529 --> 27:00.859
I'm picking up on the
"Gotta find my corner of the sky"...

27:01.730 --> 27:02.990
...vibe loud and clear.

27:03.529 --> 27:04.789
- You can help?
- No.

27:06.529 --> 27:09.059
But I can treat you
to a carafe of plasma.

27:09.529 --> 27:12.269
AB-negative here is superb.
Or so I'm told.

27:13.130 --> 27:14.109
That's it?

27:14.329 --> 27:17.279
You were supposed to do
some mojo. Show me my path.

27:17.930 --> 27:19.930
You're on it, my cacophony.

27:20.329 --> 27:23.660
I'm not your travel agent
for this trip. Brown eyes is.

27:25.130 --> 27:27.940
Stick with her.
Let your pal be your guide.

27:29.930 --> 27:32.000
Cacophony. That's pretty.

27:33.529 --> 27:34.859
What's it mean?

27:37.130 --> 27:38.109
Cordy!

27:41.930 --> 27:45.759
I see you have other concerns
at the moment, but we need you.

27:46.130 --> 27:48.519
- Why?
- The attacks are in a 10-block area.

27:49.130 --> 27:51.059
The cult must be around there.

27:51.529 --> 27:55.039
We'll drive around the area.
Maybe you'll see something.

27:55.730 --> 27:58.500
- Like a red bird.
- For instance.

27:59.930 --> 28:00.799
Okay.

28:01.730 --> 28:04.750
Harmony, I have to go.
Work stuff. You okay here?

28:05.329 --> 28:07.930
You kidding? Free blood, potato skins.

28:08.329 --> 28:11.140
Hey, I'm thinking about
doing another number.

28:11.930 --> 28:14.180
Do you think,
"Candle in the Wind"...

28:14.329 --> 28:16.750
...or the Princess Di
"Candle in the Wind"?

28:18.529 --> 28:19.900
Go nuts. Do both.

28:21.529 --> 28:24.650
Okay. Like the green guy said,
you're my guide.

28:27.529 --> 28:30.690
So we're on the same page,
when we find this cult...

28:31.730 --> 28:32.809
...we kill them.

28:33.529 --> 28:34.509
Let's do it.

28:46.730 --> 28:49.779
- Harmony?
- I got it. He said stick with you.

28:50.329 --> 28:53.099
- I understand where my place is.
- Where?

28:55.130 --> 28:57.730
With you.
I'm one of the good guys now.

29:11.690 --> 29:14.740
This is gonna be great.
I am an evil-fighter.

29:15.890 --> 29:18.799
I suck at being evil because
I'm meant to fight it.

29:19.490 --> 29:23.349
It's so clear now. Is this what
it feels like to have purpose?

29:24.289 --> 29:25.160
I mean, wow!

29:25.490 --> 29:29.599
Look at us, we're working together.
I never had a job before.

29:30.289 --> 29:32.359
We can gossip at the water cooler.

29:33.049 --> 29:35.150
Harm, I'm trying to concentrate.

29:36.049 --> 29:37.450
Oh. Sorry.

29:39.049 --> 29:41.220
How long have you been fighting evil?

29:42.049 --> 29:44.369
I just started, but I got some moves.

29:44.450 --> 29:46.269
- Angel!
- You have to tell her.

29:47.450 --> 29:48.990
She won't listen to me.

29:49.250 --> 29:50.549
Welcome to my world.

29:51.049 --> 29:52.519
That would be so funny.

29:53.450 --> 29:56.220
- Oh, do we get paid vacations?
- Stop!

29:57.049 --> 29:58.059
Pull over here!

30:07.250 --> 30:08.579
- Is that--?
- I don't--

30:09.049 --> 30:10.210
I'm not sure.

30:16.849 --> 30:18.640
The bird you saw was red.

30:19.250 --> 30:21.109
It is. I mean, it was.

30:21.650 --> 30:24.140
- Looks like puke green.
- Not like a duck.

30:24.650 --> 30:26.400
There's something familiar.

30:27.049 --> 30:29.049
We passed this place before.

30:30.049 --> 30:31.380
Cordelia?

30:32.450 --> 30:34.450
No. No, I guess it isn't it.

30:34.849 --> 30:35.789
Right.

30:36.049 --> 30:37.349
In the car. We'll--

30:37.849 --> 30:38.900
Where's Angel?

30:45.049 --> 30:46.839
Forgot to turn on the lights.

30:47.450 --> 30:49.450
- I told you this was it.
- Right.

30:49.849 --> 30:52.130
Angel and Cordelia, cover the front.

30:55.250 --> 30:57.349
We'll see if there's another way in.

30:57.650 --> 30:59.509
What about me? What's my job?

31:03.650 --> 31:05.190
- Guard the car.
- You got it.

31:05.450 --> 31:08.009
Anyone comes near,
I'll rip his throat out.

31:08.450 --> 31:09.609
No. No killing.

31:10.250 --> 31:12.210
- Okay, maiming only.
- No!

31:12.650 --> 31:15.420
Yell louder, they didn't hear us.

31:16.250 --> 31:17.480
Go. I'll talk to her.

31:20.450 --> 31:22.450
Touching. With the hands.

31:23.450 --> 31:26.609
You know, I've tried not
to say anything.

31:27.049 --> 31:29.539
I tried to let things
sort themselves out.

31:30.049 --> 31:32.299
But Harmony cannot work with us.

31:33.049 --> 31:35.079
I know. It was just temporary.

31:35.450 --> 31:38.359
Look. She loves this.
Gives her a reason to go on.

31:39.049 --> 31:41.960
I don't want her going on.
Neither should you.

31:42.650 --> 31:43.730
She's the enemy.

31:45.650 --> 31:48.390
- You sound like Wesley.
- Because he's right.

31:49.250 --> 31:50.930
Harmony will turn on you.

31:53.450 --> 31:55.339
Why? Because you did?

31:56.450 --> 31:58.519
- She's a vampire.
- So are you.

31:59.450 --> 32:02.359
- She doesn't have a soul.
- That's it, is it?

32:03.049 --> 32:05.579
- You're better because you do?
- Yeah.

32:06.650 --> 32:09.250
Yours didn't stop you
from betraying us.

32:09.650 --> 32:10.730
We cared about you.

32:11.450 --> 32:13.910
And you didn't
just betray me, Angel.

32:14.450 --> 32:17.779
You didn't just hurt me.
You gave away my clothes.

32:18.650 --> 32:20.750
- To the needy.
- I am the needy.

32:22.849 --> 32:26.180
I was afraid you were
becoming Angelus again.

32:27.049 --> 32:30.380
Imagine what could have happened
if you'd slept with Darla.

32:31.250 --> 32:33.210
You know I would never do that.

32:33.650 --> 32:35.789
- No way to see inside.
- Or how many.

32:36.049 --> 32:39.980
Okay, I'll go in, pretend I want
to join up, get a headcount.

32:40.849 --> 32:43.730
Too many nightcrawlers know your face.

32:44.450 --> 32:46.589
- Some can sense your soul.
- Right.

32:48.650 --> 32:49.519
Harmony!

32:51.650 --> 32:52.519
Yeah?

32:52.849 --> 32:55.619
She doesn't have a soul.
Nobody knows her.

32:55.849 --> 32:58.130
She can be a spy.
Tell us what's what.

32:58.849 --> 32:59.720
- Me?
- No way.

33:00.049 --> 33:02.859
- I got a bad feeling.
- I know she can do it.

33:04.250 --> 33:05.829
You can do this, right?

33:06.049 --> 33:09.880
I kind of thought I'd start out
with light typing, car-guarding.

33:10.849 --> 33:12.430
Something low pressure.

33:15.650 --> 33:18.809
This is the chance you needed
to find a purpose.

33:19.250 --> 33:21.710
But I thought I had purpose
guarding the--

33:24.650 --> 33:25.519
Yeah.

33:25.849 --> 33:27.740
Okay. I wanna do this.

33:30.049 --> 33:31.799
All right, Harmony, you're on.

33:33.650 --> 33:35.019
Watch out, evil.

33:36.650 --> 33:38.019
Here comes Harmony.

33:39.650 --> 33:41.440
Hey, we'll meet you out back.

33:45.329 --> 33:49.230
You may be thinking, "I'm not
like you. I don't have what it takes."

33:50.130 --> 33:53.960
That's just your inner human,
the neuroses of your past life.

33:56.130 --> 33:59.539
Ignore it. Instead, say,
"I'm in control of my un-life."

34:00.329 --> 34:04.190
A nice big hand for Tibor,
graduating to the yellow level.

34:09.929 --> 34:13.480
Now, with each level ascension
there are rewards.

34:15.329 --> 34:17.500
Grab yourself a nice juicy one.

34:22.530 --> 34:24.599
Come on, let's hear it!

34:28.530 --> 34:29.400
Let's hear it!

34:35.130 --> 34:37.340
- She should be back.
- Maybe she's stuck.

34:37.530 --> 34:39.070
Give her a minute.

34:40.530 --> 34:43.090
- This was a bad idea.
- We can rescue her.

34:43.530 --> 34:47.010
Now we're saving a vampire
from vampires? No way.

34:47.730 --> 34:49.309
That is so-- Harmony!

34:51.329 --> 34:54.280
- Are you okay?
- Fine. There's maybe 100 of them.

34:54.929 --> 34:56.610
And a cage full of people.

34:57.329 --> 34:59.119
You did it. You so rule!

34:59.130 --> 35:01.760
I know! I left the
back door open. Come on.

35:02.730 --> 35:06.280
I have to thank you again
for giving me this opportunity.

35:07.530 --> 35:10.940
You could have totally staked me
in Cordelia's apartment.

35:11.730 --> 35:15.659
And who would have blamed you?
One more vampire turned to dust.

35:16.530 --> 35:20.250
But you helped me find my destiny.
I really appreciate it.

35:21.329 --> 35:23.190
I've never belonged anywhere.

35:23.130 --> 35:24.989
Yes, yes. You're welcome.

35:27.929 --> 35:30.000
The vampires, where are they?

35:30.929 --> 35:32.539
Oh, right behind you.

35:44.730 --> 35:46.059
I belong with them.

35:54.409 --> 35:57.960
That is an impressive display
of potential actualization.

35:58.610 --> 36:00.710
A member of us for 20 minutes...

36:01.010 --> 36:03.150
...and look what she's delivered.

36:03.409 --> 36:05.940
Two to turn, and one for food.

36:07.010 --> 36:08.940
As a bonus, the infamous Angel.

36:13.010 --> 36:15.329
Someone made the ascension
to blue robe.

36:15.409 --> 36:17.659
- Oh, goody.
- Congratulations, Harmony.

36:18.409 --> 36:22.309
Taking the first steps to mastering
my destiny. Like you said.

36:23.809 --> 36:24.750
Well, Harmony...

36:25.010 --> 36:28.630
...aren't you just the most
weak-willed, soft-brained--

36:29.210 --> 36:31.460
Those comments are growth inhibitors.

36:32.210 --> 36:34.280
I tune out mental roadblocks.

36:38.809 --> 36:41.550
You can all put your weapons down now.

36:43.610 --> 36:47.400
Really, Angel, you don't want
all your friends to die horribly.

36:49.010 --> 36:50.690
No, I don't.

36:53.210 --> 36:54.260
Wesley?

36:55.010 --> 36:55.989
Kill them all!

37:20.530 --> 37:21.539
- You okay?
- Yeah.

37:21.730 --> 37:23.340
Get those people out.

37:23.530 --> 37:25.739
It's all right, we'll get you out.

37:34.329 --> 37:37.840
Why are you working with humans?
Maximize your potential.

37:38.530 --> 37:40.420
Empower your vampire self.

37:53.530 --> 37:57.039
- What's so funny?
- Your crossbow is aimed at my throat.

37:57.929 --> 38:00.070
You're stupid.
That won't kill me.

38:00.929 --> 38:04.409
No, it'll hurt like hell.
This is the one that'll kill you.

38:22.530 --> 38:25.690
Okay, you're angry. I don't blame you.

38:26.730 --> 38:29.710
Just, you know, it's nothing personal.

38:30.929 --> 38:32.440
I'm evil.

38:33.329 --> 38:35.190
We're still friends, right?

38:41.050 --> 38:42.590
This way, quickly.

39:05.050 --> 39:07.960
- We're still friends?
- No, we're not friends.

39:09.849 --> 39:11.429
- Get out of here.
- Really?

39:11.650 --> 39:14.420
Not just here.
I want you out of my city.

39:15.250 --> 39:17.250
You'll want to be far away.

39:17.650 --> 39:20.389
But I left a few things at the-- Bye.

39:27.409 --> 39:30.739
Don't say anything. Not a word.

39:43.889 --> 39:48.389
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes. Please, come in. Close the door.

39:52.289 --> 39:53.159
I just--

39:56.489 --> 39:59.329
I thought we'd meet
before Cordelia arrived.

40:00.090 --> 40:04.059
I know things have been strained
between the two of you.

40:04.889 --> 40:06.610
Working in such close quarters--

40:06.690 --> 40:08.300
It's okay, Wesley, really.

40:09.090 --> 40:13.760
She has a right to feel that way.
I'm willing to give her room.

40:15.690 --> 40:16.849
Good.

40:17.489 --> 40:18.539
Good!

40:19.289 --> 40:22.409
That's just the right attitude.
Time and space...

40:22.889 --> 40:25.380
...are really the only things
one can give.

40:25.889 --> 40:28.659
As long as we understand that,
the healing--

40:30.690 --> 40:32.860
Oh, my God, these are gorgeous!

40:33.090 --> 40:35.440
You have the most amazing taste.

40:36.090 --> 40:38.260
You have like a gay man's taste.

40:38.489 --> 40:42.840
That's saying something.
I love them so much!

40:43.889 --> 40:47.079
Thank you, thank you, thank you!
You're the best!

40:49.889 --> 40:53.469
I have to go try these on.
La-la-la-la-la!

40:54.090 --> 40:55.599
I have new clothes!

40:56.489 --> 40:58.099
I have new clothes!

40:59.489 --> 41:00.889
I got her clothes.

41:01.889 --> 41:03.400
New clothes!

41:03.690 --> 41:05.300
New clothes, new clothes.

41:43.889 --> 41:45.639
Thank you, thank you very much,

41:46.305 --> 41:52.781
