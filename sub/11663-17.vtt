(mellow music playing)

01:06.567 --> 01:08.533
Everybody, listen to this.

01:09.700 --> 01:14.734
Alex Trebek and the <i>Jeopardy!</i> people
are auditioning contestants in Miami.

01:14.800 --> 01:15.934
They're coming here.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.467
<i>Jeopardy!</i> Oh, it's my favorite show.
Wowee!

01:21.066 --> 01:22.066
Oh!

01:22.133 --> 01:25.333
Yes, pussycat.
<i>Jeopardy!</i> is your favorite show.

01:25.400 --> 01:29.467
-I watch it every night.
-We know. We missed the entire Gulf War.

01:30.900 --> 01:33.166
I like to play along. Sometimes I win.

01:33.233 --> 01:35.133
Yes. Yes, you do, pussycat.

01:35.200 --> 01:37.633
You win a lot.
You've got a wonderful life.

01:39.667 --> 01:42.900
I'm going to do it, Ma. This is my shot.

01:42.967 --> 01:45.633
They're taking applications
beginning Monday morning.

01:45.700 --> 01:48.567
-I'm going to be the first in line.
-Make that second.

01:48.633 --> 01:51.967
What, Blanche?
You've never cared about <i>Jeopardy!</i>

01:52.033 --> 01:54.300
But I do care for Alex Trebek.

01:55.667 --> 01:58.834
See, I've never had a Canadian
who wasn't on skates.

02:03.633 --> 02:05.533
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

02:06.500 --> 02:11.700
I have this recurring fantasy.
"Take me, Alex. Take me now," I tell him.

02:12.033 --> 02:15.800
Then he says, "uh-uh-uh, Blanche.
In the form of a question."

02:20.734 --> 02:25.533
Wow. What a tough day.
I really need somebody to talk to.

02:25.600 --> 02:26.867
Got to go.

02:28.734 --> 02:31.667
Rose, honey, come here
and sit down a minute.

02:31.734 --> 02:35.800
Dorothy and I've been noticing
how down you've been lately.

02:35.867 --> 02:37.734
We're very concerned.

02:37.800 --> 02:39.867
Oh, it's my work at the hospital.

02:39.934 --> 02:42.800
I know. I volunteered...

02:43.100 --> 02:45.834
but it's not easy spending that much time

02:45.900 --> 02:49.233
with people who are
old and sick and frail.

02:49.300 --> 02:51.633
That reminds me.
I got mah jong tomorrow.

02:54.033 --> 02:56.166
Anyway, we wanted to pick up
your spirits, Rose,

02:56.233 --> 02:58.700
so close your eyes. Close your eyes.

03:03.467 --> 03:06.233
Very funny, Blanche.
Just give me the gift.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.567
Rose, Rose, open your eyes.

03:14.834 --> 03:19.633
Oh, my God. It's a dog!
Oh, you gave me a dog!

03:19.700 --> 03:23.066
We got him from the shelter.
His name is Jake.

03:23.133 --> 03:27.266
Oh, he's adorable.
Oh, I love you already.

03:27.333 --> 03:30.333
In fact, I haven't felt this way
about a dog since...

03:30.734 --> 03:35.200
-since Rusty.
-Oh, God, not the Rusty story again.

03:37.200 --> 03:41.000
Charlie brought him home after our first
child was born.

03:41.066 --> 03:44.567
If we had a doggie door,
I'd push your head through it.

03:45.333 --> 03:50.166
Oh, he was the best,
trustworthy, loyal, smart as a whip.

03:50.233 --> 03:53.533
I thought Rusty was going to be
with our family forever.

03:53.600 --> 03:57.433
Do we have any candles?
I'd like to drip some hot wax in my ears.

03:58.100 --> 04:02.133
Then one horrible, horrible night,
our house caught on fire.

04:02.200 --> 04:06.867
It was Rusty who awakened everybody.
Rusty pulled us all to safety.

04:07.266 --> 04:11.900
He even dashed back in the burning
building to rescue Scruffy, our cat,

04:11.967 --> 04:14.533
-whom he never whom he never really liked.
-Really liked.

04:15.700 --> 04:18.233
Yes, sir. He was a real hero.

04:18.834 --> 04:22.367
Oh, if only he hadn't gone
back in for the TV.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.500
He was a dachshund, for God's sake.
What made him think he could carry a TV?

04:29.533 --> 04:32.000
You know how pig-headed
the Germans are.

04:32.800 --> 04:36.133
Oh, Jake, you're never
going to leave my side.

04:36.533 --> 04:40.600
In fact, I'll get you a job with me
at the hospital.

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
They have a program where animals visit
the elderly patients and cheer them up.

04:46.867 --> 04:48.133
Hey!

04:48.200 --> 04:51.533
That slipper's from the Mamie Van Doren
collection!

04:52.667 --> 04:54.233
Will you look at that?

04:54.300 --> 04:55.967
Man's best friend...

04:56.633 --> 04:58.900
chasing man's best friend.

05:00.667 --> 05:04.900
(serene music playing)

05:06.633 --> 05:09.500
-Mr. Hubbard, Mrs. Hubbard.
-Hello, Rose.

05:09.767 --> 05:12.367
I see you brought along
the hospital chef.

05:13.700 --> 05:18.100
-Jake, don't be pushy.
-What a cute little guy this is.

05:18.166 --> 05:19.500
How about that?

05:19.567 --> 05:22.900
I haven't seen Grace with such spirit
since she came.

05:22.967 --> 05:26.500
-That's Jake's job, cheering up patients.
-It's working.

05:26.567 --> 05:30.433
-Grace loves animals. Always has.
-Everybody does, Mr. Hubbard.

05:30.500 --> 05:33.000
That's why ancient man,
when he needed pets,

05:33.066 --> 05:34.734
turned to the animal kingdom.

05:37.800 --> 05:39.000
I see.

05:40.934 --> 05:47.700
-What a good boy. Yes, you are.
-Oh, he reminds me of my old dog Rusty.

05:49.166 --> 05:54.100
Rose, please, Grace isn't feeling well.
Can we skip the Rusty story today?

05:55.433 --> 05:59.200
(calm music playing)

05:59.266 --> 06:01.333
Okay, everybody, please take a seat.

06:03.100 --> 06:04.834
There's not much to explain.

06:05.233 --> 06:08.700
The questions we've selected
will test your general knowledge.

06:08.767 --> 06:10.166
It's not an easy exam.

06:10.533 --> 06:12.333
History tells us that only ten percent
of you

06:12.400 --> 06:14.367
will score high enough
to be asked back.

06:14.433 --> 06:18.633
Wow. Ten percent.
I mean, one out of five.

06:24.100 --> 06:25.433
All right, everybody set?

06:25.500 --> 06:28.233
Oh, uh, excuse me,
but where is Mr. Trebek?

06:28.300 --> 06:30.633
Lady, I've worked here 11 years,
and I haven't met him.

06:33.166 --> 06:35.900
Okay, if there's nothing else,
let's begin.

06:44.633 --> 06:45.734
Dorothy.

06:46.934 --> 06:48.600
Where are the Ural Mountains?

06:48.934 --> 06:50.467
Well, well, well, Blanche.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.467
A pot of lip gloss
and a tube of Maybelline

06:53.533 --> 06:55.834
can't help you now, can they, Blanche?

07:00.834 --> 07:02.400
Who needs you, anyway?

07:03.066 --> 07:04.133
Hey.

07:07.066 --> 07:09.066
I'll show you mine if you show me yours.

07:10.734 --> 07:14.500
(serene music playing)

07:14.567 --> 07:18.100
It's been two days.
Why haven't those <i>Jeopardy! </i>people called?

07:18.166 --> 07:20.567
Dorothy, I'm surprised at this reaction.

07:20.934 --> 07:22.867
God knows you've had your share
of experience

07:22.934 --> 07:24.800
sitting by a phone that doesn't ring.

07:27.233 --> 07:30.834
Girls, you wouldn't believe the progress
Mrs. Hubbard is making.

07:30.900 --> 07:31.967
Is she feeling better?

07:32.033 --> 07:36.767
It's like a miracle. She's laughing
and talking, and all because of Jake.

07:37.033 --> 07:39.867
Oh, I cannot thank you enough.

07:39.934 --> 07:42.433
That dog's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

07:42.500 --> 07:44.033
Here comes our hero now.

07:44.100 --> 07:49.000
And he has my slipper again.
I do not believe this.

07:49.066 --> 07:52.066
I hid this in the closet behind
three suitcases.

07:52.133 --> 07:55.266
Isn't this dog amazing?
He can find anything.

07:55.333 --> 07:56.400
Anything?

07:56.467 --> 07:59.300
A viable democrat for president. Go!

08:04.600 --> 08:07.166
(telephone rings)

08:08.567 --> 08:09.700
Hello?

08:10.033 --> 08:12.734
Yes, this is she.
My God, it's them. It's <i>Jeopardy!</i>

08:13.934 --> 08:15.200
I did?

08:15.533 --> 08:19.333
Oh, this is wonderful. Wonderful.

08:19.400 --> 08:20.400
What?

08:20.467 --> 08:22.633
Yes. Yes, she's my roommate.

08:23.600 --> 08:30.600
Oh, that is fabulous news, too.
Oh, sure, sure. I'll be happy to tell her.

08:30.667 --> 08:31.900
Blanche,
you flunked.

08:38.600 --> 08:43.233
(calm music playing)

08:44.033 --> 08:48.100
(mellow music playing)

08:49.000 --> 08:52.033
Don't tell me you've
been studying all night.

08:52.100 --> 08:54.533
That's just downright unhealthy.

08:54.600 --> 08:57.400
Please. I am exhausted,
but I have to keep going.

08:57.667 --> 09:00.333
If I survive the trial run, I'm on.

09:00.400 --> 09:04.400
Besides, in college,
we'd pull all-nighters all the time.

09:04.467 --> 09:06.100
That sounds so hard.

09:06.367 --> 09:07.800
Thank God I was pretty.

09:12.467 --> 09:16.300
Dorothy, sorry I can't quiz you.
Jake's due at the Hubbard's.

09:16.367 --> 09:19.767
But this book should help you prepare
for your tryout.

09:19.834 --> 09:22.567
"The St. Olaf high school yearbook"?

09:23.100 --> 09:26.100
Thanks, anyway, Rose.
I don't think I'll be needing it.

09:26.734 --> 09:28.767
Well, ok, miss know-it-all.

09:29.934 --> 09:31.533
But if Alex Trebek asks you

09:31.600 --> 09:35.200
what years Ulf Horvald was on the student
council back-to-back,

09:35.266 --> 09:37.166
don't come crying to me.

09:37.233 --> 09:39.567
1946 and '47.

09:40.900 --> 09:42.567
I intend to win this.

09:48.900 --> 09:51.367
Dorothy, get some sleep.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.567
You're being too intense here.

09:54.300 --> 09:56.767
Don't you remember that spelling bee
in second grade?

09:56.834 --> 10:00.834
You beat everyone so bad, they wouldn't
invite you to any birthday parties.

10:00.900 --> 10:03.200
That wasn't because of the spelling bee.

10:03.266 --> 10:06.533
The kids were just jealous of me.
Jealous.

10:06.600 --> 10:09.333
-J-e-a-l--
-All right, all right.

10:09.800 --> 10:14.066
-Besides, all that studying paid off.
-Oh, yeah. Paid off.

10:14.133 --> 10:15.934
You got knocked up in high school.

10:16.934 --> 10:19.000
Ma, I'm 60 years old.

10:19.066 --> 10:22.667
Why must you bring this up
every day of my life?

10:22.734 --> 10:24.667
So it won't happen again.

10:28.333 --> 10:33.000
"Potsdam conference... July 1945.

10:33.633 --> 10:37.533
Present were Truman, Stalin...

10:38.266 --> 10:39.834
Trebek..."

10:42.633 --> 10:48.033
<i>And now, from Miami, Florida,</i>
<i>this is</i> Jeopardy!

10:48.567 --> 10:50.633
<i>Let's bring out today's contestants.</i>

10:50.700 --> 10:54.700
<i>First, a substitute high school teacher,</i>
<i>Dorothy Zbornak.</i>

10:54.767 --> 10:58.367
<i>Next, cruise ship purser</i>
<i>Charlie Dietz.</i>

10:58.433 --> 11:00.033
Welcome aboard.

11:01.300 --> 11:05.367
For you babes who
didn't think I had a mind, I cry, too.

11:06.834 --> 11:08.700
<i>Wow. You are sensitive.</i>

11:10.333 --> 11:16.066
<i>And finally, our four-time</i>

11:16.133 --> 11:20.066
<i>attempting today to set an all-time</i>

11:20.133 --> 11:24.133
<i>television associate producer,</i>
<i>Rose Nylund.</i>

11:26.900 --> 11:30.734
Four-time champion?
How? This woman is an idiot.

11:33.333 --> 11:34.333
<i>Oh, really?</i>

11:34.400 --> 11:36.600
She <i>didn't get knocked up in high school.</i>

11:43.400 --> 11:48.767
<i>And now, the host of</i> Jeopardy!
<i>Alex Trebek!</i>

11:49.200 --> 11:51.767
Thank you, Johnny Gilbert.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

11:51.834 --> 11:56.033
Welcome to another of our special programs
coming to you from Florida.

11:56.100 --> 12:00.300
You've just met our three contestants.
They're all very eager to get under way.

12:00.367 --> 12:01.834
The categories are...

12:02.333 --> 12:03.600
cows...

12:04.367 --> 12:05.500
babes...

12:06.633 --> 12:07.633
chickens...

12:08.233 --> 12:09.567
more babes...

12:09.900 --> 12:10.967
chicken babes...

12:12.667 --> 12:14.900
and finally... baby chickens.

12:17.600 --> 12:21.200
Rose, you're the returning champion.
That means you make the first selection.

12:21.266 --> 12:24.667
Alex, as you know,
I was raised in a rural community.

12:25.333 --> 12:28.200
I'm proud to take cows for $300.

12:29.633 --> 12:30.900
The answer is...

12:33.000 --> 12:34.734
-Rose?
-What is a heifer?

12:34.800 --> 12:36.600
Right. Select again.

12:36.667 --> 12:38.066
Cows for $400.

12:38.133 --> 12:39.433
Answer this time...

12:44.000 --> 12:46.867
-Charlie?
-What is <i>The Farmer's Daughter?</i>

12:46.934 --> 12:48.066
You are right.

12:49.166 --> 12:51.300
I thought it was a different kind of
movie.

12:53.967 --> 12:57.367
-Let's go to babes for $100.
-Babes it is.

12:57.433 --> 13:03.500
The answer... Charlie?

13:03.567 --> 13:06.533
What are miss July's
all-time favorite films?

13:07.700 --> 13:08.867
You're right once again.

13:08.934 --> 13:12.533
I believe she's taken up windsurfing
since her magazine appearance.

13:14.233 --> 13:16.900
<i>-That's correct, Alex.</i>
-Thank you, Johnny. Charlie?

13:16.967 --> 13:19.767
I'm on a roll.
Give me more babes for $500.

13:19.834 --> 13:23.066
Wait a minute. This is ridiculous.
This isn't <i>Jeopardy!</i>

13:23.133 --> 13:27.266
It's a dream, Dorothy. Go along with it.
Anything can happen in a dream.

13:29.066 --> 13:32.133
So let's move on to double <i>Jeopardy!</i>

13:32.200 --> 13:35.400
The categories for this more difficult
round of play are...

13:53.400 --> 13:55.567
Rose, again you select first.

13:56.066 --> 14:00.967
-Uh... uh... gum for $200.
-The answer is...

14:07.033 --> 14:09.033
-Rose.
-What is juicy fruit?

14:12.667 --> 14:15.300
-No, I'm sorry. That is incorrect.
-Charlie. You rang in.

14:16.266 --> 14:19.834
I didn't mean to buzz,
I was just scratching myself.

14:22.600 --> 14:25.767
That's going to be a very costly itch.
Dorothy, you want to try?

14:25.834 --> 14:29.000
-What is cummi?
-Absolutely right. Where next?

14:29.066 --> 14:34.700
Uh, Alex, structural engineering
for... I'm going to go for it... $1,000.

14:34.767 --> 14:37.867
In fact, give me every category for
$1,000.

14:37.934 --> 14:41.200
That's what I call real <i>Jeopardy!</i>
Dorothy, proceed.

14:42.100 --> 14:44.767
Uh, what is the Verrazano narrows?

14:45.166 --> 14:47.000
What is a foot-candle?

14:47.066 --> 14:49.400
What is the Theodosia code?

14:49.467 --> 14:51.467
What is the speed of light?

14:52.200 --> 14:57.333
What's the point of any of this, Alex?
I am humiliating these two.

14:59.200 --> 15:02.834
Rose, Charlie, I'm afraid Dorothy's
absolutely right about that, too.

15:02.900 --> 15:05.834
Why don't we go on to final <i>Jeopardy!</i>

15:05.900 --> 15:09.300
Today, our final <i>Jeopardy!</i>
category is this...

15:09.700 --> 15:13.367
-US history.
-My major in college!

15:15.133 --> 15:17.233
Players, make your wagers.

15:17.300 --> 15:19.800
Today's final <i>Jeopardy! </i>answer is...

15:25.934 --> 15:32.900
(tense theme playing)

15:34.000 --> 15:36.867
All right, contestants, time's up.
We'll begin with Charlie.

15:36.934 --> 15:38.800
What did you put down?

15:44.300 --> 15:45.734
What is that?

15:45.800 --> 15:48.300
I didn't know the answer,
so I drew a little man.

15:49.600 --> 15:50.934
Is it this guy?

15:52.400 --> 15:54.600
No, I'm afraid
it's not. Let's go to Rose.

15:54.667 --> 15:58.066
Her response to "American hero buried
in Grant's tomb" was...

15:58.133 --> 16:00.467
"Who is Cary Grant?"

16:03.934 --> 16:08.100
This shouldn't surprise anyone.
Our champion is right again.

16:08.166 --> 16:10.500
-Right?
-Your wager?

16:10.567 --> 16:15.500
You didn't wager anything. Very close
to the vest, Rose. Very slick, indeed.

16:15.567 --> 16:18.433
-Dorothy?
-W... w... wait a minute.

16:18.500 --> 16:21.500
Cary is not the Grant buried
in Grant's tomb.

16:21.567 --> 16:23.767
Ulysses S. is.

16:23.834 --> 16:29.166
Ulysses s. was a Grant, but he is not
the correct response. Sorry.

16:29.500 --> 16:32.900
But I bet everything. I demand a ruling.

16:32.967 --> 16:34.200
You're in luck.

16:34.266 --> 16:39.333
In the wings is the only man alive who
knows more than me about this subject,

16:39.400 --> 16:41.934
the creator of our show, Merv Griffin.

16:44.667 --> 16:47.133
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Alex.

16:47.200 --> 16:52.066
Dorothy, this is my show, and I say
the correct answer is Cary Grant,

16:52.133 --> 16:54.667
just like you see in that fine portrait
there.

16:57.800 --> 17:00.033
Mr. Griffin, please.

17:00.100 --> 17:02.367
You are the most beloved man in America.

17:02.433 --> 17:06.734
You're bright, you're charming,
you are the anti-Trump.

17:09.000 --> 17:13.400
Excuse me, Dorothy. Mr. Griffin really
hates it when people kiss up to him.

17:13.467 --> 17:16.166
-Right, Excellency?
-Absolutely right.

17:16.233 --> 17:18.900
-And just for that, no parting gifts.
-All right!

17:18.967 --> 17:21.900
-Ha ha!
-But I won.

17:21.967 --> 17:23.433
I won.

17:24.166 --> 17:26.700
I won! I won!

17:26.767 --> 17:28.233
I won!

17:28.300 --> 17:29.834
Ohh, I won!

17:29.900 --> 17:31.433
I won!

17:31.900 --> 17:33.567
I won.

17:34.266 --> 17:38.734
I won! I won!

17:39.967 --> 17:42.166
She must be having the shot put dream
again.

17:43.834 --> 17:48.367
(mellow music playing)

17:49.266 --> 17:52.600
Hello. Anybody home?
Welcome wagon. Come and get it.

17:53.867 --> 17:55.066
Hello, Rose.

17:55.133 --> 17:58.700
-Mr. Hubbard, I didn't expect--
-Grace took a turn for the worse,

17:58.767 --> 18:01.433
and, well, she's out of pain now.

18:01.934 --> 18:03.800
Oh, I'm so sorry.

18:03.867 --> 18:06.734
We're going to miss her,
aren't we, Jake?

18:07.166 --> 18:10.000
We're going to miss her, aren't we, boy?

18:10.633 --> 18:12.066
Mr. Hubbard...

18:14.934 --> 18:17.600
I know it's a lot to ask
at a time like this,

18:17.667 --> 18:23.867
but I've been finding it a bit much,
morning walks and all...

18:24.367 --> 18:28.166
I wonder, would there be any chance
you'd consider...

18:28.834 --> 18:30.300
Jake's coming to live with you?

18:30.367 --> 18:34.233
Well, if he's too much trouble...
are you sure?

18:34.300 --> 18:37.300
You'd be doing me a favor.

18:38.033 --> 18:41.300
-Thank you, Mr. Hubbard.
-Rose, thank you.

18:46.500 --> 18:47.500
Listen...

18:47.934 --> 18:49.266
you be a good boy.

18:49.700 --> 18:54.266
Don't chase. Always remember,
cats are people, too.

18:58.834 --> 19:00.367
I'm going to miss you, Jake.

19:02.000 --> 19:06.734
(calm music playing)

19:07.367 --> 19:11.367
Ok, players, prepare to play today's
final simulated game.

19:11.800 --> 19:13.266
Our contestants,

19:13.333 --> 19:18.000
professor Reginald Bradley of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration...

19:19.066 --> 19:21.066
Dr. Julie Steever,

19:21.133 --> 19:23.867
chief of neurosurgery,
Victory Memorial hospital...

19:24.734 --> 19:29.233
and Dorothy Zbornak,
a substitute teacher.

19:31.433 --> 19:35.700
All right.
Our first category is English history.

19:36.333 --> 19:40.233
"Shared command with Cromwell in victory
at Naseby."

19:41.967 --> 19:44.233
-Uh, who's Baron Fairfax?
-That's correct.

19:44.300 --> 19:47.567
Yahoo! Ooh, that was a snap.

19:47.633 --> 19:52.033
I expected a challenge,
but I've always been a student of history.

19:52.100 --> 19:55.500
-Maybe history has never--
-Uh, miss Zbornak?

19:56.133 --> 19:57.166
Can we continue?

19:57.633 --> 20:01.500
This is the point where Alex would
tell you to shut up.

20:02.033 --> 20:06.066
He would and he should.
He is the moderator, and his function--

20:06.133 --> 20:07.467
Shut up.

20:08.500 --> 20:09.600
Sorry.

20:09.667 --> 20:11.600
Continuing with English history...

20:12.333 --> 20:14.867
"fifth wife of Henry VIII."

20:14.934 --> 20:16.667
-Who was Catherine Howard?
-Correct.

20:16.734 --> 20:21.467
The first one was a fluke,
but that one I knew.

20:22.100 --> 20:26.333
Ok, switching categories
to the <i>Book of Genesis...</i>

20:26.400 --> 20:31.000
Hey, doc, I bet you wish you hadn't wasted
all that time on Darwin now, huh?

20:33.333 --> 20:35.100
"Along with Torah,

20:35.166 --> 20:39.100
another name for the first five books
of the old testament."

20:40.033 --> 20:42.500
-What is Pentecost?
-I'm sorry.

20:42.567 --> 20:44.500
-What's <i>Pentateuch</i>?
-Correct.

20:44.567 --> 20:48.500
Pentecost... please.
Somebody stop the bleeding.

20:51.367 --> 20:54.100
Pussycat, leave some scraps
for the other nudnicks.

20:54.166 --> 20:58.700
-I might need a neurosurgeon sometime.
-Ma, these people aren't nudnicks.

20:58.967 --> 21:01.166
They're brilliant, accomplished
scientists,

21:01.233 --> 21:03.000
and I'm wiping the floor with them.

21:04.700 --> 21:07.433
Thank you, players.
I've seen all I need to.

21:08.066 --> 21:11.867
-Miss Zbornak, that was quite impressive.
-It was, wasn't it?

21:12.400 --> 21:15.533
No hard feelings.
Watch me if you're at home.

21:16.367 --> 21:18.433
That concludes our run-through.

21:18.500 --> 21:21.033
We'll give some of you
directions to the studio.

21:21.100 --> 21:24.166
Those not receiving a flyer,
thank you for playing,

21:24.233 --> 21:26.066
and better luck next time.

21:32.900 --> 21:34.033
Uh...

21:34.500 --> 21:37.367
listen, I don't want anybody
to lose his job over this,

21:37.433 --> 21:40.300
-but I didn't get a flyer.
-I realize that.

21:41.333 --> 21:43.734
But I was good. I was brilliant.

21:44.166 --> 21:47.500
I was quite impressive,
you said so yourself.

21:47.567 --> 21:49.567
How could I not be on?

21:50.467 --> 21:53.133
If you really want to know, I'll tell you.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.066
On <i>Jeopardy!,</i>

21:55.133 --> 21:58.500
we don't have any celebrity stars
as contestants.

21:58.567 --> 22:00.700
Everyday citizens, those are our stars.

22:00.767 --> 22:06.367
Those are the people our viewers care
about, identify with, root for.

22:07.700 --> 22:11.166
We don't believe anyone would root for
you. Thank you very much for coming.

22:16.233 --> 22:19.033
He said America wouldn't root for me.

22:20.033 --> 22:23.400
Sweetheart, he's wrong.
How can America not root for you?

22:23.467 --> 22:26.000
You're what this country's all about,
the daughter of immigrants,

22:26.066 --> 22:28.467
the first member of her family
to go to college.

22:28.533 --> 22:31.700
-You made something of yourself.
-Thanks, Ma.

22:32.133 --> 22:35.133
Until you got knocked up in a back seat
by a nobody.

22:38.200 --> 22:42.266
People didn't want you at their
birthday parties or in their living rooms.

22:43.033 --> 22:45.734
I thought this was supposed
to make me feel better.

22:45.800 --> 22:48.533
We did that. Now we're up to the part
where I feel better.

22:49.500 --> 22:50.834
Come on. Let's go home.

22:55.100 --> 22:57.100
-Lifesaver?
-Ah, go to hell, Ma.

22:58.233 --> 23:03.333
(serene music playing)

23:04.100 --> 23:07.834
Hi. I'm your sunshine volunteer.

23:07.900 --> 23:10.900
I have magazines and newspapers...

23:11.500 --> 23:16.834
Oh, newspapers. Every time I see one,
I think of my old dog Jake.

23:21.166 --> 23:26.266
Of course, every time I think of him,
it reminds me of my first dog, Rusty.

23:27.000 --> 23:34.000
Oh, he was the best.
I mean, he was so good...
