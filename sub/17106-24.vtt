TARA NARRATING: Previously
on "Dance Academy."

00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
MISS RAINE (OFFSCREEN): The
world's most prestigious

00:06.040 --> 00:08.279
ballet competition, the
Prix de Fonteyn,

00:08.320 --> 00:09.720
will be held in Sydney.

00:09.759 --> 00:11.320
FEMALE ANNOUNCER (OFFSCREEN):
Australia, these are your

00:11.359 --> 00:12.720
representatives.

00:12.759 --> 00:14.560
-Grace, Tara came to
me because she was

00:14.599 --> 00:16.079
worried about you.

00:16.120 --> 00:18.160
About what you said happened
with Zach.

00:18.199 --> 00:19.839
-How could you take his side?

00:19.879 --> 00:21.239
I trusted you!

00:21.280 --> 00:22.800
Just talked to Dad.

00:22.839 --> 00:25.800
In 38 hours, he'll be picking
me up from Heathrow.

00:25.839 --> 00:27.760
Oh and um, at the Nationals?

00:27.800 --> 00:29.199
I let you win.

00:29.239 --> 00:30.640
-It's over.

00:30.679 --> 00:32.840
'Cause you're still in love
with someone else.

00:32.880 --> 00:35.439
-Kat, I'm not still--

00:35.479 --> 00:39.159
I don't want to be with--

00:39.200 --> 00:46.119
[theme song]

00:46.159 --> 00:49.479
-Whoa-oh, whoa.

00:49.520 --> 00:53.079
Whoa-oh, oh.

00:53.119 --> 00:58.479
Take a breath, close
your eyes.

00:58.520 --> 01:02.439
Take a leap of faith and
lead the way tonight.

01:06.840 --> 01:08.799
This is my chance.

01:08.840 --> 01:10.799
This is my chance.

01:10.840 --> 01:13.799
My chance to feel alive.

01:13.840 --> 01:18.359
Whoa-oh, whoa.

01:18.400 --> 01:20.359
Whoa-oh, whoa.

01:44.239 --> 01:45.200
[phone ringing]

01:45.239 --> 01:46.599
TARA (ON VOICEMAIL):
Hi, it's Tara.

01:46.640 --> 01:47.519
Sorry I missed you.

01:47.560 --> 01:48.400
Leave a message.

01:48.439 --> 01:49.319
[beep]

01:49.359 --> 01:51.400
-Miss Webster?

01:51.439 --> 01:52.560
Can you believe that
this momentous

01:52.599 --> 01:55.120
day has finally arrived?

01:55.159 --> 01:57.159
It's just me and you.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.519
Prix de Fonteyn, baby!

01:59.560 --> 02:03.319
[smack]

02:03.359 --> 02:04.719
-Josie Mason, 16.

02:04.760 --> 02:06.280
Royal Ballet School.

02:06.319 --> 02:09.758
Gold medal and audience choice
at last year's Genee.

02:09.800 --> 02:10.520
-Good.

02:10.560 --> 02:11.319
And how will you beat her?

02:11.360 --> 02:12.400
-She--

02:12.439 --> 02:13.319
I don't know.

02:13.360 --> 02:16.199
Um, pirouettes en dedans.

02:16.240 --> 02:16.759
She can't turn from fifth.

02:16.800 --> 02:18.319
-But you can.

02:18.360 --> 02:20.639
Very good.

02:20.680 --> 02:22.159
Um--

02:22.199 --> 02:23.520
-[laughs]

02:23.560 --> 02:25.719
Benjamin Tickle, boyfriend.

02:25.759 --> 02:26.919
-And does he get a score?

02:26.960 --> 02:28.599
-The judges are still
considering, but he's

02:28.639 --> 02:30.840
definitely one to watch.

02:30.879 --> 02:36.800
-Hey uh, Miss Raine's
ready for us, T.

02:36.840 --> 02:38.759
[music playing]

02:38.800 --> 02:39.759
-Keep your neck long.

02:39.800 --> 02:40.800
You're straining it
just a little.

02:46.319 --> 02:47.039
Good, Sammy.

02:47.080 --> 02:48.199
Now try and get inside it.

02:59.840 --> 03:00.759
Good.

03:00.800 --> 03:02.360
That was technically
very strong.

03:02.400 --> 03:03.319
-But yeah, you're right.

03:03.360 --> 03:05.439
I just, I'm not getting
inside it.

03:05.479 --> 03:06.639
So it just feels like steps.

03:06.680 --> 03:07.719
-OK Sammy.

03:07.759 --> 03:08.680
Tara, come here.

03:08.719 --> 03:10.199
You need to hear this too.

03:14.520 --> 03:19.159
I struggle to believe I'm saying
it, but all you need

03:19.199 --> 03:20.639
now is rest and mental--

03:20.680 --> 03:21.479
-Miss Raine, I need
a new solo.

03:21.520 --> 03:22.240
-But Josie Mason never rests!

03:22.280 --> 03:23.439
She sleeps in the splits!

03:23.479 --> 03:24.280
-If I see either of you
two dancing before the

03:24.319 --> 03:25.479
competition, you'll be sorry.

03:43.800 --> 03:45.199
-Why are you awake?

03:47.840 --> 03:49.680
-I was the candidate who should
never have made it

03:49.719 --> 03:51.599
through to the Internationals.

03:51.639 --> 03:52.800
-Pants.

03:54.840 --> 03:57.280
-My contemporary solo means
absolutely nothing.

03:57.319 --> 03:59.120
That's why I'm not
connecting to it.

03:59.159 --> 04:01.599
-You're gonna need a
cardigan as well.

04:01.639 --> 04:02.479
-Well, where are we going?

04:02.520 --> 04:03.159
It's like 5:00 AM.

04:03.199 --> 04:03.759
-Shh.

04:03.800 --> 04:06.280
Not him, only us.

04:06.319 --> 04:07.479
Get changed.

04:14.360 --> 04:15.319
-There's a greater
philosophical

04:15.360 --> 04:16.800
point at work here.

04:16.839 --> 04:18.399
Why have I chosen this solo?

04:18.439 --> 04:19.639
Ergo, why do I dance at all?

04:19.680 --> 04:21.199
TARA (OFFSCREEN): To win
the Prix de Fonteyn.

04:21.240 --> 04:23.279
KAT (OFFSCREEN): No petal!

04:23.319 --> 04:24.720
You dance to fly.

04:24.759 --> 04:26.240
And you dance because---

04:29.279 --> 04:30.600
-See?

04:30.639 --> 04:33.800
'Cause I'm not doing to rebel
against Dad any more.

04:33.839 --> 04:34.600
-OK look, guys.

04:34.639 --> 04:35.600
As of tomorrow, you are both

04:35.639 --> 04:37.680
representing the entire country.

04:37.720 --> 04:41.399
And I'm one very proud leg of
this friendship tripod.

04:41.439 --> 04:44.319
So please, stop talking
and just soak it up.

05:06.360 --> 05:07.079
-Oh, come on!

05:07.120 --> 05:08.399
Seriously late, people.

05:12.240 --> 05:13.720
-Tara Webster!

05:13.759 --> 05:15.279
Congratulations.

05:15.319 --> 05:16.279
-Thank you, Mr. Heathcote.

05:16.319 --> 05:17.800
I feel honored to be here.

05:17.839 --> 05:19.120
-Mm hmm.

05:19.160 --> 05:20.519
Look, I'd better not let the
other judges think I'm

05:20.560 --> 05:21.360
favoring the home side.

05:21.399 --> 05:22.560
-[laughs]

05:27.160 --> 05:29.319
-Ah, Team UK.

05:29.360 --> 05:31.079
-I bet that's Josie Mason.

05:31.120 --> 05:32.279
-Mmm.

05:38.319 --> 05:39.279
-Grace.

05:39.319 --> 05:40.399
When did you--

05:40.439 --> 05:42.800
-I was wondering when
I'd see you guys.

05:42.839 --> 05:44.160
Hey!

05:44.199 --> 05:44.959
-What happened?

05:45.000 --> 05:47.639
You just disappeared on us.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.160
-Uh, big family drama
back in London.

05:50.199 --> 05:51.240
-Ah.

05:51.279 --> 05:52.480
-I hate goodbyes.

05:52.519 --> 05:53.480
-So you're competing
for England?

05:53.519 --> 05:54.480
-They need us.

05:54.519 --> 05:55.439
You know, nothing big.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.800
Just the official
team photograph.

05:56.839 --> 05:58.360
-Um, come by later?

05:58.399 --> 05:59.759
I'm getting everyone together
for this thing.

05:59.800 --> 06:01.120
-Oh, mysterious.

06:03.600 --> 06:07.160
He doesn't know about
Zach or why I left?

06:07.199 --> 06:09.680
-I would never tell anybody
about that.

06:09.720 --> 06:11.199
Um, how are you now?

06:11.240 --> 06:14.079
I called and wrote.

06:14.120 --> 06:15.439
-It's really good to know you're
still looking out for

06:15.480 --> 06:27.399
me, T.

06:27.439 --> 06:30.160
-OK, so now that I've
got you all here--

06:30.199 --> 06:31.720
-Dude, you're not coming
out again, are you?

06:31.759 --> 06:33.120
-[laughs]

06:33.160 --> 06:34.360
No.

06:34.399 --> 06:37.519
Um OK, I've realized that
I dance my best when

06:37.560 --> 06:38.920
I'm with you guys.

06:38.959 --> 06:44.279
So for my contemporary song,
I, I want you all onstage

06:44.319 --> 06:45.360
doing it with me.

06:45.399 --> 06:46.720
-Uh, hold on.

06:46.759 --> 06:49.480
So you want to make your Prix
solo a group activity?

06:49.519 --> 06:50.040
-Yes.

06:50.079 --> 06:51.240
Yes, I do.

06:51.279 --> 06:52.759
-Well, what about the rules?

06:52.800 --> 06:54.839
-Well I'm, I'm not gonna change
the choreography.

06:54.879 --> 06:56.439
I'll be at the front, you guys
will just be up there with me

06:56.480 --> 06:57.800
making me look good.

06:57.839 --> 06:59.240
-No Sammy, there's a reason why
we didn't cut it at the

06:59.279 --> 07:00.800
Nationals, all right?

07:00.839 --> 07:01.720
-It's just a gimmick.

07:01.759 --> 07:03.120
You're self-sabotaging.

07:06.240 --> 07:07.600
-You haven't said a word.

07:10.319 --> 07:12.600
I know it's Christian, but I
don't want you to feel like

07:12.639 --> 07:14.319
you can't talk to me
about the breakup.

07:14.360 --> 07:18.240
-And I, I totally would, but
uh, it, it's boring.

07:18.279 --> 07:21.439
They're just, whatever,
ballet boys.

07:21.480 --> 07:22.600
-T?

07:22.639 --> 07:25.079
Hey um, I know we're technically
rivals now.

07:25.120 --> 07:28.480
But this all got sprung on me
so last minute and I was

07:28.519 --> 07:29.519
wondering if you could--

07:29.560 --> 07:31.240
TARA (OFFSCREEN): How
did that happen?

07:31.279 --> 07:33.800
What happened to Josie Mason?

07:33.839 --> 07:35.240
-What?

07:35.279 --> 07:36.639
After I pushed her down the
stairs and broke her ankle?

07:36.680 --> 07:38.360
[laughs]

07:38.399 --> 07:41.120
Seriously, can you just
watch my rehearsal?

07:41.160 --> 07:42.319
I need your feedback.

07:47.519 --> 07:48.399
Bear with me.

07:48.439 --> 07:49.639
I'm a little nervous.

07:57.519 --> 08:09.279
[music playing]

08:09.319 --> 08:11.279
-Abigail, Wendy's in a battle,
but she's still Wendy.

08:11.319 --> 08:12.759
I want to see that
sweetness, yeah?

08:12.800 --> 08:15.600
The vulnerability.

08:15.639 --> 08:17.160
Sammy, I was told you're
not meant to be

08:17.199 --> 08:18.079
anywhere near a studio.

08:18.120 --> 08:19.319
What's going on?

08:19.360 --> 08:20.519
SAMMY (OFFSCREEN): Just
feeling adrift, sir.

08:20.560 --> 08:22.319
-All right, well make
yourself useful.

08:22.360 --> 08:24.519
Grab that camera and
film this for me.

08:24.560 --> 08:28.480
[thud]

08:28.519 --> 08:30.480
[beep]

08:30.519 --> 08:40.480
[music playing]

08:40.519 --> 08:51.279
[music playing]

08:51.320 --> 08:54.799
-So what do you think?

08:54.840 --> 08:56.799
The look on your face, T!

08:56.840 --> 08:57.919
[laughs]

08:57.960 --> 09:00.200
-You know how much that
solo means to me.

09:00.240 --> 09:04.200
-So why aren't you performing
it in the Internationals?

09:04.240 --> 09:05.799
Oh right.

09:05.840 --> 09:07.679
Because you could never
do it properly.

09:07.720 --> 09:09.320
-Why are you doing this?

09:09.360 --> 09:11.600
-Don't be that naive.

09:11.639 --> 09:14.399
I was there for you through
Saskia, through Kat.

09:14.440 --> 09:17.480
And you betrayed me!

09:17.519 --> 09:19.159
Feel special.

09:19.200 --> 09:21.480
I had to move mountains so that
I could come back and

09:21.519 --> 09:23.399
take away what you want most.

09:23.440 --> 09:24.759
-Which is?

09:24.799 --> 09:28.559
-I'm going to win the Prix de
Fonteyn doing your solo.

09:28.600 --> 09:31.159
And you're going to watch.

09:39.120 --> 09:43.039
[music playing]

09:43.080 --> 09:45.440
-Ugh!

09:45.480 --> 09:47.679
ZACH (OFFSCREEN): It's curtain
up in three days.

09:47.720 --> 09:49.799
That is not where
it should be.

09:49.840 --> 09:56.600
[music playing]

09:56.639 --> 09:59.080
-A bit of tension
is interesting.

09:59.120 --> 10:01.519
You two are slipping
into dysfunctional.

10:01.559 --> 10:02.799
Take it outside and
sort it out.

10:06.840 --> 10:09.600
-I don't want to be jealous
of Tara, OK?

10:09.639 --> 10:11.720
And I'm not gonna let this
affect my friendship with her.

10:11.759 --> 10:12.799
Oh wait, whoa!

10:12.840 --> 10:13.600
That's right!

10:13.639 --> 10:14.720
I invented that.

10:14.759 --> 10:15.200
You don't care she's with
Ben now, do you?

10:15.240 --> 10:15.679
-I--

10:15.720 --> 10:16.320
no, I don't.

10:16.360 --> 10:17.320
-Good!

10:17.360 --> 10:19.159
Because she's happy.

10:19.200 --> 10:20.799
She's really happy and
she's over you!

10:23.720 --> 10:24.440
[sighs]

10:24.480 --> 10:25.799
You know what, Christian?

10:25.840 --> 10:26.799
Stop lying to yourself and
admit you're in love with

10:26.840 --> 10:29.639
someone who doesn't
love you back.

10:29.679 --> 10:32.799
Trust me, it's character
building.

10:36.279 --> 10:38.399
-Hey Zach, do you want
me to upload this?

10:38.440 --> 10:39.679
-Sure, if you really need
the distraction.

10:39.720 --> 10:41.200
Uh, but be careful.

10:41.240 --> 10:42.480
I've got the whole year
saved on there.

10:48.840 --> 10:50.639
-Grace has manipulated
me this entire year.

10:50.679 --> 10:52.440
And now she expects me to
lie down and just--

10:52.480 --> 10:52.799
-Whoa, whoa!

10:52.840 --> 10:53.559
Hang on!

10:53.600 --> 10:54.600
You and Grace are friends.

10:54.639 --> 10:56.000
You don't know if she
did anything.

10:56.039 --> 10:56.840
-Grace got expelled from the
Royal for giving a girl a

10:56.879 --> 10:59.039
nervous breakdown.

10:59.080 --> 11:01.320
She's more than capable.

11:01.360 --> 11:02.759
-So I should go to the
judges, right?

11:02.799 --> 11:04.480
I should say that she hurt
someone to get on the team?

11:04.519 --> 11:05.679
-How badly do you want to win?

11:21.440 --> 11:23.360
-Mr. Heathcote?

11:23.399 --> 11:25.799
I need to speak to you
about a competitor.

11:25.840 --> 11:27.519
Confidentially.

11:27.559 --> 11:28.759
-OK.

11:34.519 --> 11:35.840
ABIGAIL (OFFSCREEN): Can you
take whatever that is

11:35.879 --> 11:38.240
somewhere else?

11:38.279 --> 11:42.559
I have to find Wendy's
sweet side.

11:42.600 --> 11:45.320
-It's not a gimmick.

11:45.360 --> 11:46.639
Wanting you on stage with me.

11:46.679 --> 11:49.279
-You're just trying to
distract the judges.

11:49.320 --> 11:50.799
Because you don't think you
deserve to be there.

11:50.840 --> 11:51.320
-[laughs]

11:51.360 --> 11:52.480
No.

11:52.519 --> 11:55.360
This is my chance to be
on the world stage.

11:55.399 --> 11:56.679
I'm showing them who
I really am.

11:56.720 --> 11:57.840
It's the only way I'm gonna
be good enough to win.

12:00.799 --> 12:02.480
Why don't you come and watch
my tech rehearsal?

12:02.519 --> 12:03.600
If you still think
I'm sabotaging,

12:03.639 --> 12:04.799
then I won't do it.

12:09.320 --> 12:09.960
OK.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.480
So be brutally honest.

12:12.519 --> 12:13.799
-I won't hold back.

12:19.759 --> 12:21.440
SAMMY (ON RECORDING): Every
dancer knows that being

12:21.480 --> 12:24.159
technically perfect
isn't enough.

12:24.200 --> 12:25.320
We need to know why we dance.

12:25.360 --> 12:35.440
[music playing]

12:35.480 --> 12:38.159
SAMMY (ON RECORDING): For me,
it's to be connected.

-Oh!

13:35.799 --> 13:37.279
Lieberman, you're not seriously
still fishing for

13:37.320 --> 13:38.240
compliments?

13:38.279 --> 13:39.639
-No, it's good though,
isn't it?

13:39.679 --> 13:40.639
-Yeah, it's good!

13:40.679 --> 13:41.240
-Isn't it?

13:41.279 --> 13:41.759
-Yeah, it's good!

13:41.799 --> 13:42.279
[giggles]

13:42.320 --> 13:42.639
Stop it!

13:42.679 --> 13:43.240
Don't!

13:43.279 --> 13:44.399
Put me down!

14:08.360 --> 14:09.320
-I better g--

14:09.360 --> 14:09.919
I've got rehearsals
in the morning.

14:09.960 --> 14:10.559
So I've gotta go.

14:10.600 --> 14:11.240
-Yeah.

14:11.279 --> 14:12.399
Yeah, me, me too.

14:12.440 --> 14:14.720
I've got uh, the competition.

14:14.759 --> 14:16.120
Not rehearsals, obviously.

14:19.279 --> 14:24.600
-[laughs]

14:24.639 --> 14:27.639
BEN (OFFSCREEN):
Leotard choice.

14:27.679 --> 14:29.320
Class section.

14:29.360 --> 14:31.759
And well, I am prepared
to model these

14:31.799 --> 14:33.720
for you if it helps.

14:33.759 --> 14:37.200
-I am calling your
bluff, Tickle.

14:37.240 --> 14:40.240
-Reed-o, you in uh,
for Team Tara?

14:40.279 --> 14:41.200
-I'll pass.

14:41.240 --> 14:42.399
Thanks.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.480
-So, when you win--

14:49.519 --> 14:50.120
-If I win.

14:50.159 --> 14:52.600
It's a big if.

14:52.639 --> 14:53.799
-You still choosing Moscow?

14:56.360 --> 14:57.480
-I think so.

14:57.519 --> 14:58.480
Can you imagine?

14:58.519 --> 15:00.720
A, a whole year living
overseas.

15:04.440 --> 15:05.600
You're gonna miss me.

15:19.840 --> 15:22.799
-Didn't we sign off on
a run this morning?

15:22.840 --> 15:24.799
It's a crucial part of my whole
mental clarity routine.

15:24.840 --> 15:25.759
-Yeah, I know.

15:25.799 --> 15:27.799
I have to go see Tara.

15:27.840 --> 15:30.080
-Oh, she's at the theater.

15:30.120 --> 15:31.480
I can give her a message.

15:31.519 --> 15:32.519
-No.

15:32.559 --> 15:36.159
It's um, I have to tell
her something.

15:36.200 --> 15:38.600
-Don't.

15:38.639 --> 15:39.559
-What?

15:39.600 --> 15:42.200
-Don't tell her anything.

15:42.240 --> 15:43.399
Not today.

15:46.639 --> 15:48.279
She's with Ben, dude!

15:48.320 --> 15:49.720
-I know.

15:49.759 --> 15:51.799
And if she wants to be with Ben,
she'll still be with Ben.

15:51.840 --> 15:54.519
-OK, forgetting the fact that
you and Ben are friends, we've

15:54.559 --> 15:58.840
all lived through, "Tara, I love
you." "No Kat, it's you."

15:58.879 --> 16:00.159
Those girls are my sisters.

16:00.200 --> 16:01.399
-I know that!

16:01.440 --> 16:03.720
But if she wins the Prix,
then she can leave.

16:03.759 --> 16:05.279
And I wouldn't have told her.

16:06.159 --> 16:07.360
You're gonna do what you want.

16:07.399 --> 16:10.320
-Yeah, I am.

16:10.360 --> 16:11.639
-You don't go with
my blessing.

16:25.159 --> 16:26.480
Of, of course.

16:26.519 --> 16:29.440
-The Royal Ballet School
contacted Josie's parents, who

16:29.480 --> 16:32.399
confirmed that she
was in hospital.

16:32.440 --> 16:34.480
With appendicitis.

16:34.519 --> 16:37.039
Grace Whitney auditioned
for Josie's place

16:37.080 --> 16:39.039

16:39.080 --> 16:40.639
-It's just me and you.

Look, I think Christian's
on his way to see you.

16:46.240 --> 16:49.799
But um, ignore him, OK?

16:49.840 --> 16:53.799
This is your day, T. Don't
get distracted.

16:53.840 --> 16:55.120
-I honestly thought that--

16:55.159 --> 16:56.799
-You thought that you would
try and undermine the

16:56.840 --> 16:59.320
competition.

16:59.360 --> 17:00.159
Which is not only

17:00.200 --> 17:01.559
unsportsmanlike, it's deceitful.

17:45.200 --> 17:50.279
-Um, could you call him and tell
him that I don't want to

17:50.319 --> 17:54.200
mess with his prep, but I would
really like him here?

17:54.240 --> 17:54.640
-Yeah.

17:54.680 --> 17:55.599
Sure.

17:55.640 --> 17:56.799

No, why?

19:31.200 --> 19:32.480
No, just tell me
