00:19.119 --> 00:21.019
It's alive!

00:35.769 --> 00:36.827
Aah!

00:42.876 --> 00:45.902
That better not be poo.

00:48.815 --> 00:51.409
Ha ha ha ha ha!

00:51.451 --> 00:53.544
That'll teach you to vote for Nader!

00:53.586 --> 00:55.645
Ha ha ha ha... huh?

00:55.688 --> 00:57.451
What the hell?

00:59.626 --> 01:04.154
I got laid! I got laid! I got laid!

01:04.197 --> 01:06.529
What can I say? Nerds are hot.

01:06.566 --> 01:08.431
Gonna tell the internet.
Laid! Laid! Laid!

01:08.468 --> 01:09.799
L-a-y-e-d!

01:09.836 --> 01:10.962
Laid, laid, laid, laid,
laid, laid, laid, laid!

01:11.004 --> 01:13.063
Mmm. Hot.

01:13.106 --> 01:16.269
Simon says... go play in traffic.

01:16.309 --> 01:18.072
- Yay!
- Yay!

01:18.111 --> 01:20.375
You know, movie producer Dean Devlin...

01:20.413 --> 01:23.576
I always felt bad about screwing
millions of moviegoers...

01:23.616 --> 01:25.015
out of their hard-earned money...

01:25.051 --> 01:27.576
with that steaming pile of crap
we made called <i>Godzilla.</i>

01:27.620 --> 01:30.384
I know, Roland Emmerich.
We should totally remake it.

01:30.423 --> 01:32.584
A remake of a remake?

01:32.625 --> 01:33.649
Brilliant!

01:36.563 --> 01:38.190
The eggs, they're hatching!

01:38.231 --> 01:40.392
Run! Run!

01:43.136 --> 01:44.330
Aah!

01:50.677 --> 01:52.406
Whew.

02:23.309 --> 02:27.075
We gave you jerks $150 million
to remake <i>Godzilla...</i>

02:27.113 --> 02:30.549
and you gave us a steaming pile of crap!
Again!

02:32.352 --> 02:34.582
- Yes!
- Yes!

02:34.621 --> 02:39.115
The only thing we have to fear
is fear itself.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.649
And spiders.

02:40.693 --> 02:45.027
Well, yes, and spiders.
That goes without saying.

02:45.064 --> 02:47.897
- And snakes.
- Yes, snakes, too.

02:47.934 --> 02:49.367
And don't forget werewolves.

02:49.402 --> 02:51.393
There is no such thing.

02:54.607 --> 03:01.035
Ooh! Yeah! Fun! Yeah! Aha!

03:03.650 --> 03:07.142
Aah!

04:44.517 --> 04:49.181
That's right, folks. We've got a whole lot
of 2005 vehicles that must be sold...

04:49.222 --> 04:52.714
thanks to Crazy Davy's
chapter 11 debt restructuring.

04:54.794 --> 04:57.661
Yep, there go my wife and kids.
I won't be seeing them again.

04:57.697 --> 05:00.393
Crazy Davy's circling the bowl, folks.

05:00.433 --> 05:04.369
Hell, just bend Crazy Davy
over the hood of this fine luxury sedan...

05:04.404 --> 05:06.463
and cornhole him till you're satisfied.

05:06.506 --> 05:07.768
And as a special bonus...

05:07.807 --> 05:09.968
if you find my brains
on your windshield...

05:10.009 --> 05:11.806
you can have my dog!

05:13.379 --> 05:15.506
Well, better luck next time.

05:15.548 --> 05:19.882
OK, so the only things
we have to fear...

05:19.919 --> 05:25.380
are spiders, snakes, werewolves,
sharks, dying alone...

05:25.425 --> 05:27.086
zombies, clowns, heights...

05:27.126 --> 05:29.651
big dogs, robots with human brains...

05:29.696 --> 05:34.224
Johnson's wife, and fear itself.

05:34.267 --> 05:35.894
Man, my life sucks.

05:35.935 --> 05:38.460
I hate working
at the stupid archery range.

05:40.573 --> 05:43.098
Oh, what... where am I?

05:43.142 --> 05:45.372
You're in purgatory, Doug.

05:45.411 --> 05:48.812
Spin the wheel of reincarnation.

05:48.848 --> 05:52.443
Oh, boy. I hope I land
on Keira Knightley's underwear.

05:52.485 --> 05:54.953
Everyone wishes for that one.

05:59.525 --> 06:01.584
Huggytime Bear?

06:03.663 --> 06:05.631
Where am I?

06:05.665 --> 06:07.656
Holy ass crackers!

06:07.700 --> 06:10.863
Welcome!
We're the Huggytime Bears...

06:10.903 --> 06:14.566
and we shall call you Doug-a-lot Bear.

06:14.607 --> 06:16.598
What is a Huggytime Bear?

06:16.642 --> 06:21.375
We spread peace and love
with our special powers.

06:21.414 --> 06:22.904
Ah...

06:22.949 --> 06:25.315
Let's go spread joy to children!

06:25.351 --> 06:28.548
Oh, man, I wish I landed
on Keira Knightley's underwear.

06:28.588 --> 06:30.681
Uh, please don't mention that
around the children.

06:30.723 --> 06:31.883
I feel sad.

06:31.924 --> 06:33.619
Yeah, but at least we're not gay.

06:33.659 --> 06:35.559
Maybe we can help!

06:35.595 --> 06:37.187
The Huggytime Bears!

06:37.230 --> 06:40.791
Get ready
for some fun and love, every... aah!

06:43.603 --> 06:45.833
Uhh!

06:45.872 --> 06:48.238
What?
His name was Shamrock Bear.

06:48.274 --> 06:51.209
He was obviously Irish
and, therefore, drunk.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.871
Am I right, or am I right?

06:52.912 --> 06:54.345
This is unforgivable.

06:54.380 --> 06:56.109
Bring out the gimp! Hee hee!

06:57.216 --> 07:01.016
No, don't!

07:01.053 --> 07:03.521
- No!
- Oh, my gosh, I've shot you.

07:03.556 --> 07:04.784
Keira Knightley?

07:04.824 --> 07:08.089
Shh. Don't worry about a thing.
The paramedics will be here soon.

07:08.127 --> 07:11.290
Ha ha.
I was almost your underwear, you know.

07:13.766 --> 07:15.631
Ha ha, jerk ass!

07:15.668 --> 07:18.136
I got you, Timmy.

07:18.171 --> 07:20.571
L... I can't feel my arms and legs.

07:22.108 --> 07:23.336
Previously on <i>Big Brother...</i>

07:23.376 --> 07:26.243
a practical joke war
resulted in hurt feelings.

07:26.279 --> 07:27.712
Oh!

07:27.747 --> 07:31.410
Ghostface's laundry debacle
earned him the wrath of Freddy.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.316
Aw, where the hell's my sweater?

07:33.352 --> 07:35.445
Chill out. It's in the dryer.

07:35.488 --> 07:39.185
You fool! The label clearly says
permanent press.

07:40.927 --> 07:47.457
It says, whoever reaches the kitten first
will win the golden power of Veto.

07:52.972 --> 07:54.200
Competition was fierce...

07:54.240 --> 07:56.765
but it was Leatherface
who stood victorious.

07:56.809 --> 07:59.300
As a result,
it was Michael and Ghostface...

07:59.345 --> 08:01.472
who found themselves on the block.

08:01.514 --> 08:02.776
Ohh!

08:02.815 --> 08:06.273
Who will be evicted?
Find out live tonight.

08:06.319 --> 08:09.254
If Ghostface got voted out,
take it from Freddy:

08:09.288 --> 08:11.654
That would be a dream come true.

08:12.658 --> 08:15.149
You get it? A dream?

08:16.162 --> 08:18.790
I kill people in their nightmares, man.
That's what I do. It's my thing.

08:18.831 --> 08:20.958
Last week, America voted online...

08:21.000 --> 08:23.525
to decide which houseguest
would get to call home...

08:23.569 --> 08:25.002
on a T-mobile cell phone.

08:25.037 --> 08:27.096
Tonight, we have the results.

08:27.139 --> 08:30.233
And the winner is... Ghostface!

08:30.276 --> 08:34.337
America made the right choice,
giving the call to Ghostface.

08:34.380 --> 08:37.246
Of course, I would've called my mum.

08:37.283 --> 08:41.150
Today's her birthday.
I love you, Mum.

08:41.187 --> 08:43.815
- Hello?
- I see you making popcorn.

08:43.856 --> 08:47.348
- Who is this?
- I saw the <i>Charlie's Angels</i> sequel.

08:47.393 --> 08:49.293
- That was a piece of crap!
- I'm hanging up!

08:50.463 --> 08:54.331
Fighting boredom is the hardest part
of living in the <i>Big Brother</i> house.

09:06.979 --> 09:10.847
In case you were wondering,
the answer was <i>The Da Vinci Code.</i>

09:10.883 --> 09:14.114
It's time to decide
which houseguest gets evicted.

09:14.153 --> 09:17.316
Michael, Ghostface,
you may now plead your case.

09:17.356 --> 09:19.620
You know, I'm just trying to keep it real...

09:19.659 --> 09:22.253
and I will treasure
the friendships I have made...

09:22.295 --> 09:25.162
in this house my whole life.

09:25.197 --> 09:29.327
But if it's my time to go,
hey, no hard feelings. L...

09:29.368 --> 09:30.801
Your turn, Michael.

09:33.773 --> 09:36.037
Stop that. Stop it!

09:36.075 --> 09:37.667
The votes have been cast...

09:37.710 --> 09:42.306
and the next houseguest
evicted from <i>Big Brother</i> is... Michael.

09:54.694 --> 09:57.754
Michael Myers.
They just kicked you out of the house.

09:57.797 --> 09:58.855
How do you feel?

09:59.865 --> 10:03.892
I feel randy, baby, yeah!

10:03.936 --> 10:05.836
<i>- Wayne's World!</i> Party time!
- Ow!

10:05.871 --> 10:07.031
- Excellent!
- Ow!

10:07.073 --> 10:09.871
Stop stabbing me! Ow!

10:22.521 --> 10:24.318
- Ba-gawk!
- Bock.

10:28.160 --> 10:29.525
Stupid monkey.
