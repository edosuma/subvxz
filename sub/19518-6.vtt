Before Maggie OD'd,

01:39.153 --> 01:42.008

killed as retribution

01:42.033 --> 01:44.172

01:44.197 --> 01:46.093

01:50.970 --> 01:52.299
She has an alibi.

She did something.

02:04.058 --> 02:05.934
she wouldn't hurt her son.

02:05.968 --> 02:07.925
I know. What else?

02:09.058 --> 02:10.979
She's smart.

02:28.784 --> 02:30.566

when he was investigating?

02:33.629 --> 02:35.339

about Sandy is in there.

Peter said I didn't wanna be
