00:20.103 --> 00:22.731
<i>Once every 70.6 years,</i>

00:22.814 --> 00:26.568
<i>a comet sweeps through</i>
<i>our inner solar system.</i>

00:27.360 --> 00:31.823
<i>For a few exhilarating weeks,</i>
<i>it is visible from Planet Earth.</i>

00:32.699 --> 00:34.075
<i>Then it wanes,</i>

00:34.159 --> 00:38.204
<i>disappearing into</i>
<i>the great deep dark of space.</i>

00:40.040 --> 00:41.875
<i>A comet called Kharon,</i>

00:41.958 --> 00:44.210
<i>named for the ferryman of Hades,</i>

00:44.294 --> 00:48.173
<i>who carries souls of the dead</i>
<i>across the river Styx.</i>

00:49.215 --> 00:53.470
<i>Comet Kharon was discovered in 1784,</i>

00:53.553 --> 00:56.139
<i>but geological evidence suggests</i>

00:56.222 --> 01:00.477
<i>it may have once been</i>
<i>one half of a cosmic pair.</i>

01:00.560 --> 01:01.770
<i>Its companion</i>

01:01.853 --> 01:04.939
<i>is believed to have crashed to the surface</i>

01:05.023 --> 01:06.733
<i>millions of years ago,</i>

01:06.816 --> 01:08.359
<i>leaving in its wake</i>

01:08.443 --> 01:10.987
<i>a coveted and rare gemstone</i>

01:11.071 --> 01:13.198
<i>called Kharonite.</i>

01:51.861 --> 01:56.991
<i>Please help. Please find me.</i>
<i>Please help. Please find me.</i>

03:10.481 --> 03:12.025
Come on. Come on.

03:18.114 --> 03:19.365
I need to borrow your phone.

03:23.411 --> 03:26.581
<i>LMG.</i>
<i>Your call cannot be completed.</i>

03:26.664 --> 03:27.498
<i>Thank you.</i>

03:49.854 --> 03:50.897
Where is he?

03:50.980 --> 03:53.900
Please, have a seat.
Mr. Davenport will be right with you.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.241
<i>Hey, Dan.</i>

04:02.909 --> 04:05.536
<i>Let me start by thanking you</i>

04:06.120 --> 04:08.122
<i>for your excellent work.</i>

04:08.206 --> 04:11.417
What happened to me?
Why the fuck am I in the city?

04:11.501 --> 04:14.837
<i>Well, I'm afraid you, uh, pushed yourself</i>
<i>a little too hard there, Dan.</i>

04:14.921 --> 04:16.589
<i>You collapsed from exhaustion.</i>

04:16.673 --> 04:18.591
<i>We provided you with medical attention</i>

04:18.675 --> 04:21.261
<i>and we got you back home safely.</i>

04:21.344 --> 04:22.679
That's a fucking lie.

04:22.762 --> 04:25.223
You knocked me out and drugged me.

04:25.306 --> 04:27.600
<i>Well, I have your patient file right here.</i>

04:27.684 --> 04:29.352
<i>It says you had a complete workup.</i>

04:29.435 --> 04:33.648
<i>Physical exam, tox screen,</i>
<i>psych evaluation, blood work.</i>

04:33.731 --> 04:35.650
<i>They wanted to keep you under observation,</i>

04:35.733 --> 04:38.611
<i>but I thought sleeping in your own bed</i>
<i>would do you more good.</i>

04:38.695 --> 04:40.822
What the fuck was that place?

04:40.905 --> 04:42.573
That underground chamber that I found.

04:42.657 --> 04:46.077
It was the exact same room that
was found in the basement at the Visser.

04:46.160 --> 04:48.454
It's the exact same room
that your brother was planning

04:48.538 --> 04:50.915
some kind of fucked-up human sacrifice.

04:50.999 --> 04:54.919
<i>The doctors did say you were hallucinating</i>
<i>when they found you.</i>

04:55.003 --> 04:56.421
What was I doing there?

04:57.005 --> 04:59.132
What was Thomas Bellows doing there?

04:59.215 --> 05:01.217
Why were we digitizing those tapes?

05:01.301 --> 05:02.635
What do you think is on 'em?

05:03.136 --> 05:05.555
<i>Dan, are you listening to yourself?</i>

05:05.638 --> 05:08.808
You want to know
what your brother was up to, don't you?

05:08.891 --> 05:10.768
So you can see
how to follow in his footsteps?

05:10.852 --> 05:12.645
<i>Do you know how you sound,</i>

05:13.313 --> 05:16.107
<i>accusing the owner</i>
<i>of a Fortune 500 company</i>

05:16.190 --> 05:19.110
<i>of being some kind of occultist?</i>

05:19.986 --> 05:23.698
<i>You purposely destroyed</i>
<i>a lot of very expensive equipment</i>

05:23.781 --> 05:25.491
<i>at my compound, Dan.</i>

05:26.242 --> 05:28.244
<i>You may think we didn't get it on camera,</i>

05:28.328 --> 05:29.662
<i>but you'd be wrong.</i>

05:32.123 --> 05:33.291
<i>Take the money.</i>

05:34.167 --> 05:35.460
<i>Go back to your life.</i>

05:36.836 --> 05:39.088
<i>If you continue pursuing</i>
<i>these accusations,</i>

05:39.172 --> 05:40.506
<i>I'll press charges.</i>

05:49.057 --> 05:51.517
Fuck! Fuck!

06:47.407 --> 06:48.491
Mark?

06:50.910 --> 06:51.911
Holy shit.

06:53.454 --> 06:54.455
You're home.

06:55.665 --> 06:58.251
Hey. Whoa, hey, what are you doing here?

06:59.627 --> 07:00.920
I had to get…

07:01.546 --> 07:02.713
this.

07:02.797 --> 07:06.259
-Wait till you see what the fuck I got.
-Okay, did you get my message?

07:06.342 --> 07:08.511
When I drove all the way
to Camp Crystal Lake

07:08.594 --> 07:10.763
and you told me to go fuck myself?
That message?

07:10.847 --> 07:13.433
No, a message about Thomas Bellows,
about the tapes.

07:13.516 --> 07:14.517
I didn't get it.

07:18.855 --> 07:20.106
Need to show you something.

07:20.189 --> 07:22.817
<i>There is a face</i>

07:23.526 --> 07:24.527
<i>in the screen.</i>

07:25.153 --> 07:26.195
<i>Do you see it?</i>

07:27.447 --> 07:28.614
<i>You see it?</i>

07:28.698 --> 07:29.657
<i>It's in there.</i>

07:30.324 --> 07:31.868
<i>It's watching me.</i>

07:31.951 --> 07:35.455
<i>Fuck you and your tapes, Patricia.</i>

07:36.372 --> 07:37.748
<i>What did you get up to?</i>

07:39.292 --> 07:41.252
<i>What did you get up to?</i>

07:41.878 --> 07:44.088
His girlfriend undersold it.

07:44.172 --> 07:46.090
That guy went off the fucking deep end.

07:46.174 --> 07:47.175
Not sure he did.

07:48.801 --> 07:50.887
I thought I saw something
in those tapes too.

07:51.846 --> 07:54.932
I thought I was imagining it,
but now I'm not… I'm not sure.

07:55.850 --> 07:57.143
What did you see?

07:57.226 --> 07:58.728
I don't know.

08:01.105 --> 08:02.064
Wasn't human.

08:06.360 --> 08:09.947
People used to believe that film
could capture all kinds of shit that the…

08:10.031 --> 08:11.157
human eye couldn't see.

08:11.240 --> 08:13.576
You know, ghosts, spirits, fairies,

08:15.077 --> 08:15.912
demons.

08:19.874 --> 08:21.792
Now I need to show <i>you</i> something.

08:31.802 --> 08:33.679
The William Crest collection.

08:40.853 --> 08:42.271
Where did you get all this?

08:42.355 --> 08:46.567
Sorry to be the one to break this to you,
but Evie Crest died a couple weeks ago.

08:47.276 --> 08:49.529
Probably after
she sent you that first tape.

08:50.696 --> 08:51.739
Shit.

08:52.365 --> 08:56.410
Uh, William Crest was obsessed
with a cult called the Vos Society.

08:56.494 --> 08:58.412
It sprung up in New York
after World War I.

08:58.496 --> 09:01.457
Founded by Jonah, Lukas, and Iris Vos.

09:02.166 --> 09:04.293
They were into some seriously dark shit.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.963
Like human sacrifice, dark magic,

09:07.046 --> 09:10.174
an instruction manual from
a coven of witches called the Baldung.

09:12.260 --> 09:13.427
And get this.

09:13.511 --> 09:16.347
The supreme being they were trying
to raise from an alternate dimension

09:16.430 --> 09:18.975
went by the name of Kaelego.

09:23.854 --> 09:26.440
Remember that snuff film
Samuel was trying to find?

09:27.942 --> 09:29.193
Holy shit.

09:30.861 --> 09:32.613
Crest did find a copy.

09:33.948 --> 09:36.993
So, the Vos headquarters
goes up in flames in 1924,

09:37.076 --> 09:40.329
cult vanishes without a trace,
but somehow this film manages to survive.

09:40.413 --> 09:45.042
William Crest sees it at a stag party,
then he spends years tracking down, like,

09:45.126 --> 09:47.295
every piece of information
about the Vos family.

09:47.920 --> 09:51.007
I read all the scripts.
They tell the whole crazy story.

09:53.968 --> 09:56.220
And what about the pictures
you wanted to show me?

09:56.971 --> 09:58.556
Spirit photographs.

09:58.639 --> 10:01.892
The Vos family was obsessed with these.
They took hundreds of them.

10:01.976 --> 10:05.271
Most people were hoping to see a ghost,
a son or father lost in the war,

10:05.354 --> 10:08.441
but I think the Vos family
was trying to see something else.

10:11.777 --> 10:15.906
I don't know if it's a hoax or not,
but, I mean, there's something there.

10:15.990 --> 10:17.742
Is that what you've been seeing?

10:18.743 --> 10:20.119
Maybe. I'm not sure.

10:21.329 --> 10:22.288
Wait a minute.

10:28.002 --> 10:29.128
I know her.

10:29.211 --> 10:32.131
Yeah, that's Iris Vos,
owner and operator of the Vos Society.

10:33.382 --> 10:34.216
No.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.053
<i> Who is this?</i>

10:37.136 --> 10:38.346
<i> I don't know.</i>

10:40.556 --> 10:42.600
This is the woman Anabelle was painting.

11:11.045 --> 11:12.254
Are you Rose?

11:12.922 --> 11:13.798
Yes.

11:15.299 --> 11:16.592
Give me your coat.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.141
Miss Vos will see you now.

11:34.860 --> 11:36.612
-You must be Rose.
-Yes, miss.

11:37.405 --> 11:38.656
I'm Iris Vos.

11:39.240 --> 11:42.118
So, what did they tell you about the job?

11:42.743 --> 11:44.662
That you were looking for a lady's maid.

11:44.745 --> 11:47.540
That your family was very generous.

11:48.082 --> 11:50.334
-Very rich.
-Very odd?

11:50.960 --> 11:51.877
No.

11:51.961 --> 11:52.795
Not at all.

11:52.878 --> 11:53.963
It's all right.

11:54.505 --> 11:56.841
America has been good to us.

11:58.217 --> 11:59.218
What about you?

12:00.052 --> 12:03.055
I came here
with my parents and my sisters.

12:03.931 --> 12:05.224
Four years now.

12:06.350 --> 12:08.477
Uh, they all died on the ship.

12:09.145 --> 12:10.563
The typhoid fever.

12:11.355 --> 12:12.773
Oh, I'm so sorry.

12:13.691 --> 12:15.359
So you're very much alone.

12:16.694 --> 12:17.611
Yes.

12:18.529 --> 12:21.323
Well, my last maid, Anna,
disappeared a few weeks ago.

12:21.866 --> 12:23.117
We think she eloped.

12:23.200 --> 12:25.536
I'm happy for her, of course, but…

12:25.619 --> 12:27.913
I'm afraid I'm very much lost without her.

12:30.666 --> 12:32.710
Father gave me that when I was a girl.

12:34.503 --> 12:35.671
Go ahead, open it.

12:43.345 --> 12:44.597
What's the tune?

12:46.766 --> 12:48.100
It's an old folk song.

13:01.947 --> 13:03.574
Do you have religion, Rose?

13:08.996 --> 13:11.457
It's hard for me to believe in a god

13:11.540 --> 13:13.751
who would let my family die like that.

13:15.294 --> 13:17.963
It was such a terrible death, miss.

13:18.047 --> 13:20.216
Yes, I know what it's like to lose family.

13:22.468 --> 13:24.678
Sometimes I wish I died with them.

13:26.222 --> 13:27.640
So we'd all be together.

13:27.723 --> 13:29.016
Don't say that.

13:29.558 --> 13:30.684
Never say that.

13:30.768 --> 13:32.478
You <i>will</i> see them again.

13:39.693 --> 13:41.487
Now tell me, and be honest,

13:42.571 --> 13:43.823
do you like babies?

13:43.906 --> 13:46.867
Because I've been hoping for a child
for a very long time.

13:47.451 --> 13:50.538
Oh, I didn't realize you were married.

13:52.748 --> 13:56.001
My husband died in the war,
but I took back the family name.

13:57.044 --> 13:59.964
And why shouldn't I have it?
Something so dear?

14:01.131 --> 14:02.508
I don't know.

14:05.469 --> 14:07.721
I think you're very special, Rose.

14:10.474 --> 14:13.978
I think you're capable of holding
a whole new world inside of you.

14:16.146 --> 14:17.106
Don't you?

14:18.399 --> 14:20.734
I hope so, miss.

14:22.945 --> 14:23.779
Iris!

14:24.363 --> 14:26.407
Iris. It's here.

14:26.490 --> 14:27.575
Shall we go see?

14:36.542 --> 14:38.669
It's all right.
Rose is part of the family now.

14:38.752 --> 14:39.587
She's my new girl.

14:39.670 --> 14:42.256
Rose, these are my brothers,
Lukas and Jonah.

14:42.339 --> 14:43.173
Hello.

14:44.633 --> 14:45.634
Well, go on.

15:07.239 --> 15:08.324
Look at it.

15:13.787 --> 15:14.788
What is it?

15:17.666 --> 15:19.710
Everything I've ever dreamed of.

15:27.885 --> 15:28.844
Thank you.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.269
Unusual, isn't it?

15:39.396 --> 15:41.190
They say it came from a comet.

15:43.108 --> 15:44.652
Do you know what a comet is?

15:46.320 --> 15:49.907
It's the most beautiful and powerful
of all the celestial bodies.

15:49.990 --> 15:53.994
A blazing light in the night sky that can
reveal all the secrets of the universe.

16:01.710 --> 16:03.295
Come. Here, sit.

16:10.344 --> 16:12.972
Very soon, the comet will pass
so close to the Earth

16:13.055 --> 16:15.641
that you'll be able to see it
with your very own eyes.

16:20.062 --> 16:23.399
We'll have a grand party to celebrate
the good luck and fortune it will bring.

16:25.734 --> 16:28.404
Not to mention the thinning of the veil
between the worlds.

16:29.530 --> 16:30.948
What worlds, miss?

16:34.660 --> 16:36.954
Come. Let's go greet our guests.

16:41.125 --> 16:42.167
Cheers.

16:55.639 --> 16:58.726
Yes, I appreciate it. Of course.

17:04.982 --> 17:06.859
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

17:06.942 --> 17:08.318
Yes, same to you.

17:19.788 --> 17:21.081
I don't believe we've met.

17:22.082 --> 17:23.709
Ah. Emma Trillay.

17:24.835 --> 17:27.838
Oh, goodness. Don't tell me Lukas
forgot to say I was coming.

17:27.921 --> 17:29.465
He assured me I'd be quite welcome.

17:29.548 --> 17:32.760
Of course you're more than welcome.
Remind me about yourself again?

17:32.843 --> 17:34.970
I'm afraid I'm a poet.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.263
-Scandalous.
-Mm.

17:36.847 --> 17:39.349
-Published, though.
-Oh, that's something, isn't it?

17:40.517 --> 17:41.685
I must confess,

17:42.519 --> 17:45.731
I've desperately wanted
to be a part of your society for years.

17:49.735 --> 17:51.570
I want to be here for the return.

17:54.531 --> 17:55.908
And so you shall.

18:15.469 --> 18:17.888
-Why do we have to leave?
-It's not our business.

18:26.188 --> 18:28.107
I've something to show you tonight.

18:41.662 --> 18:44.998
Lukas has put every ounce
of his body and soul into finding this.

18:45.082 --> 18:47.709
Our father would've been so very proud.

18:49.378 --> 18:50.963
We're so close now.

18:51.630 --> 18:54.800
I hope you're all ready to help
bring forth a whole new world.

18:54.883 --> 18:57.302
Yes. I'm ready.

18:57.386 --> 18:58.428
Yes, I'm ready.

18:58.512 --> 19:01.849
Jonah, shall we call forth
our devotion to the Otherworld?

19:08.063 --> 19:10.524


19:55.194 --> 19:57.487
I said it's not our business.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.056
-Oh. Do you see that?
-I see it.

20:43.492 --> 20:44.868
It's working.

20:45.452 --> 20:46.536
He's with us.

20:50.666 --> 20:53.460
Imagine what we might see
with a motion-picture camera.

21:03.303 --> 21:04.846
Miss!

21:06.348 --> 21:08.850
Oh, no. Oh, no.

21:11.812 --> 21:12.938
Help!

21:17.651 --> 21:19.152
The doctor's gone home.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.576
Can I get you anything?

21:27.327 --> 21:28.537
A drop of brandy?

21:30.205 --> 21:32.416
He says if I keep trying, I'll die.

21:34.293 --> 21:35.627
Please, miss.

21:36.878 --> 21:38.922
You have to take care of yourself.

21:39.756 --> 21:40.799
I thought…

21:42.759 --> 21:43.760
My devotion…

21:43.844 --> 21:46.138
I thought he'd grant me
this one small thing.

21:47.764 --> 21:49.933
Devotion to what, miss?

21:52.894 --> 21:55.230
What if I told you there's another world…

21:57.941 --> 21:59.443
different from this one,

21:59.985 --> 22:02.529
and the being that ruled that world is…

22:02.612 --> 22:05.490
more powerful than any being
you've ever imagined?

22:07.159 --> 22:09.286
A god who can grant eternal life,

22:09.369 --> 22:10.704
eternal wealth,

22:10.787 --> 22:12.414
eternal peace.

22:13.248 --> 22:16.918
A god who can see into the future
as easily as if it were the past.

22:18.795 --> 22:21.548
Who can bend the will of any man or beast.

22:22.174 --> 22:25.635
Who can reunite us
with the people we've lost.

22:29.973 --> 22:31.141
Who can heal,

22:32.267 --> 22:33.393
destroy.

22:36.688 --> 22:38.607
Give me the child I want.

22:43.820 --> 22:45.280
The child I need.

22:52.662 --> 22:56.333
What if I told you that was the world
I had devoted my life to?

22:58.377 --> 23:00.545
Not just another world…

23:02.839 --> 23:04.174
another god?

23:06.009 --> 23:06.885
Yes.

23:09.721 --> 23:11.807
I would say it sounds like a dream.

23:23.735 --> 23:27.239
I hope that when she arrives,
she'll be a daughter like you.

23:44.464 --> 23:45.590
What are you doing?

23:47.217 --> 23:48.844
I was cleaning up the…

23:49.636 --> 23:52.597
And I found all this mold

23:52.681 --> 23:54.683
growing through the tiles.

23:54.766 --> 23:57.102
In the basement, in the pantry.

23:57.185 --> 24:00.522
Such strange patterns, miss.

24:02.649 --> 24:03.608
It's everywhere.

24:03.692 --> 24:05.110
Stop. Stop.

24:11.741 --> 24:14.035
This is what proves it's not a dream.

24:17.247 --> 24:20.083
This is the fruit
of our faith and devotion.

24:23.086 --> 24:24.629
His body and blood,

24:25.672 --> 24:28.717
they're pushing through the veil
that separates us.

24:29.551 --> 24:31.052
He's calling to us.

24:35.432 --> 24:36.850
Isn't it beautiful?

25:47.295 --> 25:48.380
What are you doing?

25:49.589 --> 25:51.216
That's Miss Iris's book.

25:52.133 --> 25:53.510
It is not her book.

25:55.679 --> 25:58.306
What has she told you about this book?

25:58.974 --> 26:00.642
About her society?

26:02.102 --> 26:04.020
Has she made you great promises?

26:05.939 --> 26:10.318
Did she promise you could hold
a whole new world inside of you?

26:13.154 --> 26:15.532
You must come with me.
Before it's too late.

26:18.952 --> 26:20.579
Oh, Emma, isn't it?

26:24.416 --> 26:25.750
I see.

26:26.668 --> 26:28.211
This doesn't belong to you.

26:29.170 --> 26:31.423
It doesn't belong to you either, Baldung.

26:31.506 --> 26:34.175
Your kind threw it away
like a piece of garbage.

26:35.093 --> 26:36.720
To keep humanity safe.

26:36.803 --> 26:40.390
No. To keep them small and servile.

26:41.308 --> 26:44.936
Do you really understand
what you're about to do?

26:46.771 --> 26:48.815
Tearing a hole between these worlds?

26:48.898 --> 26:51.610
I'm going to save humanity from itself.

26:52.360 --> 26:55.113
From war, from poverty, from sickness.

26:55.196 --> 26:56.239
No.

26:56.823 --> 27:00.827
Whatever that thing is in there,
it's not a god.

27:00.910 --> 27:02.746
It's not a savior. It's…

27:03.371 --> 27:07.542
a force of complete and total destruction.

27:07.626 --> 27:08.835
Maybe for the unfaithful.

27:08.918 --> 27:10.045
For everyone.

27:14.799 --> 27:16.551
We made a terrible mistake.

27:17.886 --> 27:21.306
We set it free
and nearly destroyed everything.

27:21.389 --> 27:22.682
And now,

27:24.017 --> 27:26.061
the handful of us that are left,

27:26.770 --> 27:29.522
we have to make sure
no one makes that mistake again.

27:31.816 --> 27:33.234
-Put it down.

27:33.860 --> 27:34.986
Jonah.

27:36.196 --> 27:37.072
Jonah.

27:39.449 --> 27:40.659
-No!

27:40.742 --> 27:42.535
-What have you done?

27:42.619 --> 27:45.038
-She was going to burn it.

27:45.121 --> 27:46.289
It doesn't burn, Jonah!

27:49.542 --> 27:51.378
We needed her.
We'll never find another in time.

27:51.461 --> 27:53.088
Should Rose fetch the doctor?

27:59.928 --> 28:00.970
I'm sorry.

28:01.513 --> 28:03.556
It's no use. She's gone.

28:06.434 --> 28:09.229
We'll take her to the bathtub,
collect all the blood we can.

28:23.118 --> 28:24.828
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

28:24.911 --> 28:25.745
No.

28:25.829 --> 28:27.205
Thank goodness.

28:28.957 --> 28:30.083
What did she say to you?

28:30.875 --> 28:32.001
I don't remember.

28:34.254 --> 28:36.840
It's all right. Everything's all right.

28:37.424 --> 28:39.968
I'd never let anything happen to you.
You know that, right?

28:41.136 --> 28:42.846
-Yes, miss.
-Okay.

28:43.471 --> 28:44.723
Go to bed.

28:44.806 --> 28:46.641
Put this all out of your head.

29:31.895 --> 29:33.313
…watch over my life.

29:34.689 --> 29:36.816
You will protect me from all harm.

29:37.567 --> 29:39.486
-You will watch over--
-What are you doing?

29:40.278 --> 29:41.529
I'm sorry, miss.

29:41.613 --> 29:43.615
I'm very much looking forward to…

29:46.951 --> 29:50.789
Well… I just thought
we could use some protection.

29:52.832 --> 29:54.083
From what?

29:54.167 --> 29:55.210
A false god?

29:56.377 --> 29:57.212
I don't know.

29:57.295 --> 29:59.631
I thought you wanted this, Rose.

30:00.298 --> 30:04.844
I thought you understood you must renounce
your allegiance to old superstitions.

30:04.928 --> 30:05.970
I do.

30:06.054 --> 30:07.055
I have.

30:08.348 --> 30:10.475
Don't you want to see your family again?

30:11.267 --> 30:12.227
Yes.

30:12.936 --> 30:14.103
Please.

30:14.187 --> 30:15.230
More than anything.

30:16.606 --> 30:17.982
We are explorers.

30:20.777 --> 30:22.153
We are seers.

30:26.950 --> 30:28.076
This is for you.

30:30.161 --> 30:30.995
For me?

30:32.664 --> 30:33.498
Miss…

30:38.044 --> 30:39.337
Now let's get your dress on.

31:14.038 --> 31:15.540
Hello there.

31:16.457 --> 31:17.542
Hello.

31:20.336 --> 31:21.212
Good evening.

31:37.812 --> 31:38.897
Can you see it?

31:45.069 --> 31:45.945
Yes.

31:58.291 --> 31:59.500
Lukas.

32:03.171 --> 32:04.088
Lukas!

32:05.757 --> 32:06.883
Lukas.

32:08.718 --> 32:11.179
Lukas, where are you going?

32:11.262 --> 32:14.724
I'm not stupid enough to think
I can stop you going through with it.

32:14.807 --> 32:16.184
But I can walk away.

32:17.393 --> 32:18.645
What are you talking about?

32:18.728 --> 32:23.650
All the blood, the death. All those people
in there you're planning to sacrifice--

32:23.733 --> 32:25.193
For a greater good.

32:25.276 --> 32:27.570
They think they're at a party, Iris.

32:27.654 --> 32:30.406
Not being used as human batteries
for your fucking jailbreak!

32:35.411 --> 32:36.412
I'm sorry.

32:39.207 --> 32:40.333
Please…

32:40.416 --> 32:41.417
Please stay.

32:42.377 --> 32:44.212
You've already given up so much.

32:45.254 --> 32:47.173
All of this for a child?

32:48.216 --> 32:49.133
No.

32:49.676 --> 32:50.760
Of course not.

32:51.386 --> 32:55.098
This is what Father wanted for all of us.

32:55.723 --> 32:58.810
He spent his whole life searching
for a way to bring a new world

32:58.893 --> 33:00.561
-into this one--
-He's dead, Iris.

33:05.733 --> 33:07.193
We'll all be together again.

33:07.276 --> 33:08.695
That's not natural.

33:10.071 --> 33:11.823
Lives end, Iris.

33:11.906 --> 33:13.241
People die.

33:13.908 --> 33:16.536
And there is war, poverty,
famine, and injustice.

33:16.619 --> 33:19.163
And humanity must
find its own way through it.

33:21.874 --> 33:23.334
Please… Please stay.

33:24.043 --> 33:26.254
I can't be a part of this.

33:35.805 --> 33:37.306
Are you all right, miss?

33:42.311 --> 33:43.438
Yes, of course.

34:07.420 --> 34:10.965
Thank you all for being here tonight
to celebrate the great comet Kharon.

34:14.177 --> 34:17.638
To the heavens and the great night sky
and all that lies within it.

34:17.722 --> 34:20.558
-Hear! Hear!
-Hear! Hear!

35:22.995 --> 35:23.996
Are you ready?

35:24.080 --> 35:25.248
Yes, of course.

35:36.008 --> 35:37.343
Where's Lukas?

35:38.678 --> 35:39.846
Lukas is gone.

36:05.288 --> 36:08.124


37:47.223 --> 37:50.226


38:51.329 --> 38:53.080
Come here, darling girl.

38:59.337 --> 39:00.671


39:08.012 --> 39:09.472


40:13.869 --> 40:16.997
So, the Vos mansion
was destroyed in a fire,

40:17.748 --> 40:19.291
just like the Visser.

40:19.375 --> 40:22.503
Iris Vos tried to raise
an all-powerful demon

40:22.586 --> 40:25.589
from another dimension
using some kind of fucked-up ritual.

40:25.673 --> 40:28.592
At some point,
Samuel must have tried the same thing.

40:28.676 --> 40:31.095
But it's not in Melody's tapes, right?
The ritual?

40:32.555 --> 40:34.598
No. The whole story just ended.

40:34.682 --> 40:37.601
No idea what happened to her
after my dad took her to Rockland.

40:37.685 --> 40:39.645
It's possible Samuel grabbed her back and…

40:40.354 --> 40:41.439
slit her throat.

40:41.522 --> 40:43.482
No, that wasn't part of his plan.

40:45.443 --> 40:47.069
He needed her. Or thought he did.

40:47.153 --> 40:48.446
He thought he needed a witch.

40:48.529 --> 40:51.115
There's gotta be someone else,
someone who knows what happened.

40:51.198 --> 40:54.326
-They can't all be dead, right?
-Someone still alive from the Visser?

40:54.410 --> 40:56.620
I ran every single
name you gave me. I got nothing.

40:56.704 --> 40:59.999
It's like they never fucking existed,
been scrubbed off the face of the earth.

41:00.082 --> 41:01.584
What about Anabelle?

41:01.667 --> 41:03.419
-The best friend?
-Yeah.

41:03.502 --> 41:04.670
She'd only be 50 now.

41:04.753 --> 41:07.339
Maybe she's still alive.
Maybe she can tell us what happened.

41:07.423 --> 41:08.841
Maybe we just leave it.

41:09.967 --> 41:11.051
What?

41:11.135 --> 41:14.597
Look, the way I see it,
this whole fucking thing is cursed.

41:14.680 --> 41:18.893
The Vos Society, fuckin' LMG,
Davenport and his fucked-up brother.

41:18.976 --> 41:21.479
-I need to know what happened to her.
-I hear you, I do.

41:21.562 --> 41:24.231
But, you know, knowing what happened, it…

41:25.232 --> 41:27.067
it's not gonna bring Melody back.

41:27.151 --> 41:28.903
My father was a part of this.

41:30.154 --> 41:32.031
He led Samuel right to her.

41:32.114 --> 41:35.534
Melody was just trying to find out
who she was and where she belonged,

41:35.618 --> 41:37.244
and they stole her life.

41:37.328 --> 41:40.206
The least I can do
is give her death an ounce of meaning.

41:43.709 --> 41:46.504
So, does, uh,
Anabelle have a last name?

41:49.465 --> 41:50.299
Cho.

41:52.426 --> 41:54.053
Let's go find Anabelle Cho.

42:00.643 --> 42:03.687
Are you fucking kidding me?
She's been in Rockland all these years?

42:04.647 --> 42:06.607
Hi. I'm Dan Turner. Uh…

42:06.690 --> 42:08.192
We called about Anabelle Cho.

42:11.195 --> 42:12.196
Anabelle?

42:15.950 --> 42:17.034
Okay.

42:31.507 --> 42:32.841
Are you Dan?

42:35.469 --> 42:36.679
Do you know me?

42:39.682 --> 42:41.517
What the fuck took you so long?

42:57.074 --> 42:58.701
She's been waiting for you.

43:00.035 --> 43:01.745
What are you talking about?

43:02.663 --> 43:03.664
Melody.

43:04.623 --> 43:05.833
She's been waiting.

43:09.837 --> 43:11.005
Where?

43:11.088 --> 43:12.298
The Otherworld.

43:14.174 --> 43:15.426
She's in there,

43:15.509 --> 43:17.011
just like Iris was.

43:23.058 --> 43:24.393
You need to get her out.
