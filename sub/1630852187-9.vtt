WEBVTT

00:07.000 --> 00:09.240
Stop the machines and erase the logs.

00:09.920 --> 00:12.120
Remove the hard drives, we're taking them.

00:12.200 --> 00:14.280
There's little left
to reach one billion.

00:14.360 --> 00:16.280
We just need to print and cut some sheets.

00:16.360 --> 00:18.120
How much time do we need, Mr. Torres?

00:18.200 --> 00:19.480
Eleven minutes.

00:19.560 --> 00:21.440
You're rounding off the numbers, Nairobi.

00:21.520 --> 00:22.840
What do you think this is?

00:23.360 --> 00:24.320
A TV game show?

00:24.440 --> 00:26.600
Go pack your bags,
I'll take care of the money.

00:26.680 --> 00:28.280
I say I'm leaving with a billion,

00:28.360 --> 00:31.080
-so I'm leaving with a billion!
-I say "stop", so you stop!

00:32.840 --> 00:34.760
Do you know why I'm in charge?

00:35.600 --> 00:37.960
Because you've got shit for brains.

00:38.400 --> 00:42.240
You want to stay in this mousetrap
to reach the billion?

00:42.320 --> 00:44.440
You know
who that reminds me of?

00:46.960 --> 00:47.920
Of a mother

00:48.840 --> 00:51.000
who leaves her child,

00:51.960 --> 00:54.440
a baby, to go sell pills.

00:56.120 --> 00:58.320
Of course, she gets caught
and loses the child.

00:58.400 --> 01:01.240
Under my command
those things don't happen, Nairobi!

01:06.080 --> 01:07.840
No, of course not.

01:07.920 --> 01:11.040
Under your command
we plan weddings with hostages.

01:11.880 --> 01:14.880
Will you get married
on the beach dressed in white?

01:15.440 --> 01:17.360
Since you know everything,

01:17.440 --> 01:19.520
do you know what she feels for you?

01:22.400 --> 01:23.600
You make her sick!

01:23.920 --> 01:25.240
I heard her in the bathroom.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.600
The only consolation she has left

01:27.800 --> 01:29.520
is that she'll keep your money.

01:30.280 --> 01:32.640
To put up with you until you drop.

01:33.320 --> 01:34.760
And when you're dying,

01:35.040 --> 01:36.080
say to your face

01:36.480 --> 01:38.120
how every time you raped her,

01:39.200 --> 01:40.680
because you're raping her,

01:41.520 --> 01:43.440
she would go to the bathroom to throw up.

01:44.960 --> 01:46.120
That's all she has left.

01:46.440 --> 01:49.120
To spit on you upon your deathbed.

01:51.080 --> 01:52.840
That's what you have turned her into.

01:56.480 --> 01:57.400
Torres,

01:58.600 --> 01:59.920
shut down the machines.

02:01.520 --> 02:02.560
Miss Nairobi?

02:07.640 --> 02:09.400
Shut down the machines, Torres.

02:09.480 --> 02:10.440
Alright.

02:22.840 --> 02:23.760
Colonel,

02:25.200 --> 02:27.040
We have the phone call made to Raquel.

02:28.400 --> 02:30.000
It was made from Angel's phone.

02:30.720 --> 02:32.680
-What?
-Deputy Inspector Rubio.

02:40.440 --> 02:42.840
Call the hospital and find out
if he woke up.

02:43.120 --> 02:45.400
If so, send three men quick.

02:46.040 --> 02:48.360
That bitch could show up there any minute.

03:58.840 --> 03:59.760
Done.

04:00.200 --> 04:01.840
Timers and cells set.

04:02.880 --> 04:04.840
This will keep the police
busy for a while.

04:04.920 --> 04:06.960
They'll have to deactivate them
one by one.

04:10.200 --> 04:11.800
What's your plan tomorrow?

04:14.560 --> 04:15.440
Tomorrow?

04:17.000 --> 04:20.280
Tomorrow I'm going to be sailing
on a cargo ship.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.480
Sunbathing with my titties out.

04:23.640 --> 04:25.000
With your titties out?

04:27.000 --> 04:28.040
To avoid tan lines.

04:29.840 --> 04:31.960
So you'll be there with your titties out

04:32.200 --> 04:33.680
with all those lonely sailors

04:34.320 --> 04:36.240
who haven't seen a woman in three months?

04:38.440 --> 04:40.920
You think I can't defend myself?

04:42.320 --> 04:44.760
Or do you want
to defend me from the peeping Toms?

04:44.920 --> 04:45.880
It's not that.

04:47.200 --> 04:48.920
That journey will be our last one.

04:50.200 --> 04:53.000
And I don't know what
you're going to do at the end.

04:53.440 --> 04:56.440
I don't know if you'll take off
on a jet ski with guns blazing

04:56.520 --> 04:58.080
or what you're going to do.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.520
So I want you to stay put.

05:01.240 --> 05:02.160
With me.

05:02.960 --> 05:03.840
In my cabin.

05:05.600 --> 05:06.480
Hey.

05:07.920 --> 05:09.680
We just hit a brick wall.

05:12.000 --> 05:12.880
Hold this.

05:24.720 --> 05:26.160
Make an opening in that wall.

05:26.240 --> 05:27.440
It leads to the sewer.

05:27.800 --> 05:29.840
That's where we'll exit through.

05:30.040 --> 05:30.920
Move.

05:34.320 --> 05:35.240
Here.

05:36.520 --> 05:37.960
Did you see all those bombs?

05:39.960 --> 05:40.840
Fuck.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.120
Twenty years of my life.

05:46.120 --> 05:47.080
Twenty years.

05:51.520 --> 05:52.360
Jesus,

05:52.560 --> 05:53.760
give me the sledgehammer.

05:56.560 --> 05:59.720
We're 200 meters from the outlet.
Estimated time, six minutes.

06:00.080 --> 06:00.960
Let's go.

06:02.200 --> 06:04.560
Copy that.
We'll report any seismic movement.

06:16.080 --> 06:16.960
Berlin,

06:17.680 --> 06:18.880
stop the chain right now.

06:19.280 --> 06:20.800
Nairobi, we're leaving.

06:20.880 --> 06:24.120
-There's still money left to pack.
-We've got excess baggage. People,

06:24.200 --> 06:26.120
it's been a pleasure robbing you,

06:26.640 --> 06:29.720
but it is time to enjoy
a well-deserved vacation.

06:32.240 --> 06:34.760
Doctor Sanchez requested in room seven.

07:00.320 --> 07:01.240
Raquel.

07:07.240 --> 07:09.440
-How are you doing?
-Well, here I am.

07:10.480 --> 07:12.440
I'm glad you pulled through.

07:14.320 --> 07:15.960
I think I owe you an apology.

07:16.160 --> 07:17.480
You don't need to apologize.

07:18.720 --> 07:22.200
Although you did call me a schmuck
and a clown.

07:22.320 --> 07:25.480
It's the most humiliating thing
I've been called in my damn life.

07:26.200 --> 07:29.040
I haven't been able
to rest peacefully in the coma.

07:31.160 --> 07:32.160
I'm really sorry.

07:35.800 --> 07:37.960
Why did they discharge you from the case?

07:41.040 --> 07:43.480
Because they think I'm with the heist men.

07:45.320 --> 07:46.360
And are you?

07:47.600 --> 07:48.440
No.

07:48.520 --> 07:50.840
But you had a relationship
with that guy.

07:53.360 --> 07:54.200
Yes.

07:54.680 --> 07:56.080
And are you in love with him?

08:09.920 --> 08:12.440
I'll give you the hangar's location.

08:13.760 --> 08:16.160
It's where he controls the operation from.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
In case you want to clear your reputation,

08:21.080 --> 08:22.680
solve the case and beat them.

08:28.720 --> 08:30.040
I know where the hangar is.

08:31.720 --> 08:33.400
But I won't tell them.

08:36.760 --> 08:37.720
Why not?

08:37.800 --> 08:39.760
Because I don't know who are the good guys

08:39.840 --> 08:41.400
or the bad guys are anymore.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.680
-Don't move!
-Hands up!

08:56.160 --> 08:57.400
Put your hands up.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.120
Lopez.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.040
Arenas.

09:08.800 --> 09:09.680
Gomez.

09:19.880 --> 09:20.920
Fuck.

09:52.560 --> 09:54.680
There will be laws on our island,
you know?

09:54.760 --> 09:56.120
We'll have to be nudist.

09:56.240 --> 09:57.840
Except me, I can wear a loincloth.

09:59.480 --> 10:01.720
Go set explosives in the warehouse,
will you?

10:23.840 --> 10:25.040
Tokyo!

10:42.960 --> 10:44.200
Move!

10:45.760 --> 10:46.840
Move!

10:47.800 --> 10:48.680
My gun!

10:48.800 --> 10:50.280
Take this one, dammit!

11:10.440 --> 11:11.760
What the fuck do we do?

11:19.000 --> 11:20.240
Fucking riot shields!

11:21.240 --> 11:22.720
We must hoot at their feet!

11:27.880 --> 11:28.760
Cover me!

11:35.120 --> 11:36.760
Sons of bitches!

11:37.880 --> 11:38.920
Lobo, damage report!

11:40.160 --> 11:42.040
They've hit several agents, sir!

11:42.120 --> 11:43.400
I'll cover you!

11:48.800 --> 11:50.200
Evacuate the wounded!

11:50.280 --> 11:51.800
Evacuate the wounded and go on!

11:54.120 --> 11:56.160
If we get out
I'll put down my weapon.

11:56.240 --> 11:57.080
I swear.

11:57.160 --> 11:58.240
You mean it?

11:58.320 --> 12:00.080
Not even an air rifle at the fair.

12:06.800 --> 12:08.680
Come on, get them!

12:11.600 --> 12:12.840
Besides,

12:12.920 --> 12:14.960
we have to get things for our island,
right?

12:16.880 --> 12:17.880
Curtains,

12:18.320 --> 12:19.160
couches...

12:19.280 --> 12:20.120
Our island?

12:22.000 --> 12:23.400
Sons of bitches!

12:25.240 --> 12:27.520
Go, go, go, give them hell!

12:29.680 --> 12:31.320
-Fuck!
-Lobo, now!

12:32.720 --> 12:34.760
They're coming! Let's go!

12:34.840 --> 12:36.280
-Fuck!
-Let's go!

12:37.400 --> 12:38.360
Let's go!

12:38.640 --> 12:39.560
Go!

12:42.360 --> 12:43.560
Go, go, go.

12:44.280 --> 12:45.440
Fuck!

12:45.520 --> 12:46.920
-Move!
-Let's go.

12:48.520 --> 12:50.800
-Hold your ground.
-We have to reach that door!

12:53.000 --> 12:54.720
Hold your fire! Don't shoot!

12:54.800 --> 12:55.880
-Anibal.
-What?

12:57.360 --> 12:58.200
Stay covered.

12:58.280 --> 12:59.240
Give me your badge.

13:00.120 --> 13:01.120
The engagement badge?

13:02.400 --> 13:03.440
Now!

13:05.480 --> 13:06.480
Hold your ground!

13:12.880 --> 13:14.000
Hold your ground!

13:16.600 --> 13:17.760
-I love you!
-I love you!

13:21.920 --> 13:22.760
Here I go!

13:23.080 --> 13:23.920
Now!

13:28.640 --> 13:29.640
Tokyo!

13:33.200 --> 13:34.280
Tokyo!

13:36.440 --> 13:37.280
Tokyo!

13:39.800 --> 13:41.400
-Tokyo.
-You're under arrest!

13:41.760 --> 13:42.600
Don't move!

13:43.760 --> 13:44.800
-Rio!
-Don't move!

13:45.280 --> 13:46.840
-Rio.
-No, don't shoot!

13:46.920 --> 13:48.080
Move away from her!

13:48.320 --> 13:49.840
-Hands up!
-Rio, get down!

13:58.240 --> 13:59.200
Shit!

14:00.240 --> 14:01.160
Shit!

14:24.000 --> 14:25.040
Run, run!

14:25.600 --> 14:27.080
Lobo, Ruiz! Are you holding up?

14:27.760 --> 14:28.800
Ruiz, fuck!

14:29.440 --> 14:30.440
Evacuate Ruiz!

14:31.640 --> 14:32.680
Rio!

14:33.320 --> 14:34.240
-Denver!
-What?

14:34.320 --> 14:36.440
Go get the Browning.
Meet us in the vault!

14:36.520 --> 14:37.360
Okay.

14:37.840 --> 14:39.240
-Go!
-Let's move!

14:41.440 --> 14:42.640
We're under attack!

14:43.480 --> 14:46.400
Get in formation and move!
Let's get them!

14:49.720 --> 14:50.600
Yes, sir.

14:52.720 --> 14:53.760
I'll put him on.

14:56.600 --> 14:58.080
The CNI has taken over.

14:58.560 --> 14:59.760
It's Colonel Prieto.

15:01.080 --> 15:02.120
Angel, how are you?

15:02.920 --> 15:05.880
Well, I've seen better days, to be honest.

15:06.240 --> 15:07.800
Hey, I'm curious,

15:08.000 --> 15:10.840
why did you call Inspector Murillo first?

15:11.800 --> 15:13.160
Because we're friends.

15:14.880 --> 15:15.960
Don't screw with me.

15:16.280 --> 15:17.960
Why did she come to see you?

15:18.400 --> 15:20.320
She came because we're friends.

15:21.880 --> 15:24.000
She humiliated you
in front of the team,

15:24.080 --> 15:25.960
almost ended your career
and your life.

15:26.040 --> 15:28.760
So drop this fucking friendship bullshit.

15:31.600 --> 15:33.440
I'll repeat the question, Angel.

15:34.920 --> 15:36.720
Why did you call Inspector Murillo?

15:38.000 --> 15:39.600
Because she's my friend.

15:40.360 --> 15:42.840
You were at the hideout
of the Professor.

15:42.920 --> 15:44.880
I know you took a teaspoon

15:44.960 --> 15:47.360
and turned it over
to forensics for analysis.

15:47.840 --> 15:48.960
Give us the address.

15:50.480 --> 15:51.800
I don't remember anything.

15:53.160 --> 15:55.600
-I don't remember a fucking thing.
-Right.

15:57.600 --> 16:02.000
You know that hiding information
is an offense of concealment.

16:02.320 --> 16:04.960
You may end up sharing a cell
with the heist men,

16:05.360 --> 16:07.520
or with your friend.

16:10.160 --> 16:11.320
Give us the address.

16:15.000 --> 16:15.920
Prieto...

16:20.320 --> 16:23.960
you sure know how to treat a guy
who just came out of a coma.

16:39.600 --> 16:41.920
Let's go! Nobody stays behind!

16:42.120 --> 16:42.960
Let's go!

16:48.400 --> 16:49.840
Everyone put your masks on!

16:51.360 --> 16:53.920
-They're inside.
-Take the Browning to vault three!

16:54.440 --> 16:55.360
Denver's on it.

16:55.520 --> 16:56.880
What about the hostages?

16:56.960 --> 16:58.600
-We hand them over.
-Everyone mix!

16:58.920 --> 17:00.920
Mix, scramble and on your knees!

17:01.520 --> 17:02.480
Let's go!

17:05.480 --> 17:06.440
Well, not everyone.

17:07.800 --> 17:09.360
Ariadna is coming with me.

17:10.720 --> 17:12.000
Let's go, Helsinki!

17:19.240 --> 17:20.600
They're in the museum.

17:24.200 --> 17:27.840
Hands up where I can see them.
All of you, hands up!

17:27.920 --> 17:29.920
-Don't shoot.
-Don't shoot, we're hostages!

17:30.000 --> 17:31.200
Everyone, masks off!

17:36.400 --> 17:37.480
They're hostages.

17:38.240 --> 17:40.080
They're hostages, get them out. Now!

17:40.920 --> 17:42.520
Prepared for rescue protocol.

17:43.600 --> 17:45.200
-We're freeing hostages.
- Suarez,

17:45.280 --> 17:46.800
we're sticking to the plan.

17:47.120 --> 17:48.560
Go to the basement.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.640
We must get them out
through the tunnel.

17:50.720 --> 17:54.000
You, with them. The rest with me,
to the basement. Let's go!

18:50.400 --> 18:51.640
We've got Parker.

18:54.480 --> 18:55.960
Get me the ambassador.

18:56.040 --> 18:58.600
Do a headcount
and identity check of the hostages.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.240
Colonel, we're making
our way down the sewer.

19:07.000 --> 19:07.840
Move.

19:14.600 --> 19:16.000
What the hell is that?

19:16.200 --> 19:17.360
Move in the TEDAX unit.

19:18.320 --> 19:20.160
The basement is full of explosives.

19:20.240 --> 19:21.240
Motherfuckers.

19:29.880 --> 19:31.080
Can you defuse it?

19:33.720 --> 19:35.480
Yes, but I'll need time, sir.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.760
The detonator could be
close to the RDX.

19:38.880 --> 19:40.120
There may be tripwires.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.720
We are detecting
movement in the tunnel, sir.

19:46.360 --> 19:47.680
Closing in on the target.

20:01.400 --> 20:04.680
-They're on the other side of the wall.
-Five of the robbers.

20:06.440 --> 20:07.320
Wait.

20:08.240 --> 20:09.360
There are six of them.

20:09.880 --> 20:10.840
It's them.

20:11.440 --> 20:13.960
They're about to exit the hole
into the sewer.

20:15.680 --> 20:17.280
Underground agents ready.

20:17.760 --> 20:19.640
-They're closing in on you.
- Copy that.

20:20.400 --> 20:22.480
We've got you, motherfuckers.

20:23.120 --> 20:24.040
In six seconds,

20:24.920 --> 20:25.760
five,

20:25.880 --> 20:26.720
four,

20:27.720 --> 20:28.720
three,

20:29.400 --> 20:30.240
two,

20:30.920 --> 20:31.760
one.

20:32.640 --> 20:33.480
Don't move.

20:33.960 --> 20:35.080
Hold your ground.

20:36.560 --> 20:37.480
Hold it.

20:41.280 --> 20:42.280
Hands up!

20:42.360 --> 20:43.440
-Down!
-Don't shoot!

20:44.000 --> 20:45.680
-Don't shoot!
-Turn off the light!

20:47.480 --> 20:48.560
Don't shoot!

20:48.800 --> 20:49.880
I'm Arturo Roman!

20:50.640 --> 20:52.240
They're hostages, hold your fire!

20:53.320 --> 20:55.000
Confirmed, they're hostages.

20:55.720 --> 20:56.600
No!

20:59.120 --> 21:01.680
I may not have always
been able to read women.

21:01.800 --> 21:04.200
Maybe because of my ego.
But with you it's different.

21:04.360 --> 21:05.960
I know exactly what you feel.

21:06.040 --> 21:07.840
I know that even without money,

21:07.920 --> 21:11.120
you'd come with me anywhere
because you're madly in love.

21:11.200 --> 21:12.960
-Isn't that right?
-Yes, of course.

21:13.400 --> 21:15.960
That's why I want you to know
that I love you too.

21:16.800 --> 21:18.040
Berlin, hurry!

21:18.160 --> 21:19.720
And the little time we have left

21:20.280 --> 21:22.920
is going to be like fireworks.

21:40.520 --> 21:41.920
A wonderful toy.

21:44.120 --> 21:46.200
Wonderful toy, Helsinki!

21:46.400 --> 21:47.640
Nairobi, how's that going?

21:47.720 --> 21:50.560
The trench is in place,
just the last batch of money left.

21:50.640 --> 21:51.520
Helsinki!

21:52.080 --> 21:52.920
Let's go!

21:53.520 --> 21:54.520
Let's go, hurry.

21:55.920 --> 21:56.800
Colonel,

21:57.400 --> 21:58.800
they have another tunnel.

22:01.800 --> 22:02.680
What?

22:02.800 --> 22:04.960
They're taking the money to the vault.

22:05.400 --> 22:06.320
We saw them.

22:06.600 --> 22:09.600
They made a hole in the ground
and they'll take it out through it.

22:09.720 --> 22:10.720
Come here.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.160
There are four vaults,
two on each side of the corridor.

22:17.280 --> 22:20.320
Can you tell me which one it is,
or point it out on the map?

22:24.480 --> 22:25.920
Vault number three.

22:27.480 --> 22:28.840
Are you sure, Alison?

22:32.240 --> 22:33.120
Yes.

22:33.400 --> 22:34.280
Suarez.

22:34.440 --> 22:35.320
Do you copy?

22:35.400 --> 22:36.960
-Copy, sir.
-Change of plans.

22:37.040 --> 22:38.960
Vault 3. Top priority.

22:39.040 --> 22:41.360
Repeat, top priority.
That's where their tunnel is.

22:41.440 --> 22:42.560
Roger that, Colonel.

22:42.840 --> 22:45.040
To vault 3! Go, go, go!

22:45.520 --> 22:47.480
Do you know
where that tunnel leads?

22:47.560 --> 22:48.920
They don't know, but I do.

22:50.240 --> 22:53.560
To the hangar
where the fucking Professor works.

22:54.400 --> 22:55.760
That's their escape route.

22:58.200 --> 23:00.520
Bring in Inspector Murillo, now!

23:02.760 --> 23:06.040
Gomez, get Inspector Murillo here,
immediately!

23:11.320 --> 23:13.360
Will you get your son when you get out?

23:13.440 --> 23:14.320
No.

23:14.920 --> 23:15.920
Not for now.

23:17.680 --> 23:18.760
I'm out of a plan.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.240
We can share a flat.

23:25.600 --> 23:26.440
Helsinki.

23:29.400 --> 23:30.800
Let's get out of here. Now!

23:30.880 --> 23:33.400
-They're in the basement.
-Let's go!

23:33.480 --> 23:34.360
Get out now.

23:34.440 --> 23:37.080
-What about Denver?
-On his way to the hangar. Get out!

23:39.000 --> 23:40.200
That's an order.

23:51.200 --> 23:52.120
Berlin!

23:52.440 --> 23:53.320
Let's go!

24:09.240 --> 24:11.720
They're coming down the stairs.
They're almost there.

24:11.800 --> 24:13.080
Okay, copy that.

24:13.280 --> 24:14.480
They know where we are.

24:14.560 --> 24:15.600
Get out of here.

24:15.880 --> 24:18.640
-It's now or never.
-Helsinki, take Nairobi.

24:18.720 --> 24:20.960
-I'll hold the fort.
-What do you mean?

24:21.040 --> 24:21.960
I said go!

24:22.040 --> 24:24.000
If they enter the tunnel, we're all dead!

24:27.880 --> 24:29.080
What are you doing?

24:29.160 --> 24:31.320
Someone has to stay in the trench.

24:31.400 --> 24:33.840
-No.
-Yes, they're hot on our heels!

24:33.920 --> 24:36.680
-Well, we're all leaving together!
-Nairobi,

24:39.720 --> 24:41.560
You said I was sexist, right?

24:45.040 --> 24:46.840
Well then, women and queers first.

24:47.320 --> 24:48.560
-Let's go.
-I hate you!

24:48.640 --> 24:49.560
Come on!

24:50.720 --> 24:52.120
-I hate you!
-Come on!

24:55.200 --> 24:57.680
Come on.
Everyone at their stations.

25:01.720 --> 25:02.640
Wait!

25:05.320 --> 25:06.200
Hey.

25:07.400 --> 25:08.720
Where are you going, honey?

25:10.160 --> 25:13.040
We had agreed that we
would stay together to the end.

25:13.120 --> 25:13.960
No!

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
Berlin, please.

25:18.480 --> 25:20.400
No! Let me out!

25:20.480 --> 25:22.240
Let me out, damn it!

25:22.920 --> 25:24.800
-Stay still!
-Fuck you, bastard!

25:25.080 --> 25:26.040
Bastard!

25:26.120 --> 25:27.280
You son of a bitch!

25:31.600 --> 25:33.360
You and I are the resistance.

25:52.680 --> 25:54.040
You're a sorry sight.

25:58.120 --> 25:59.440
Where's the hangar?

26:03.320 --> 26:04.200
I don't know.

26:05.560 --> 26:06.880
Not only do you know,

26:06.960 --> 26:09.040
but you know
that I know you know,

26:09.120 --> 26:10.840
so let's spare ourselves this part.

26:33.960 --> 26:35.480
Heavy fire, take cover!

26:43.520 --> 26:44.440
We must go back.

26:44.600 --> 26:45.920
No, Nairobi. No.

26:46.200 --> 26:48.040
There's no time. Let's go.

26:49.680 --> 26:50.840
Ariadna, load it!

26:51.320 --> 26:52.240
Load it!

26:52.320 --> 26:53.280
Now!

26:57.360 --> 26:58.720
Load it, come on!

27:11.120 --> 27:13.280
This is a lawsuit for legal custody.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.040
And it was presented
by the hero of the case,

27:19.160 --> 27:22.400
the officer who identified
the leader of the operation.

27:23.320 --> 27:24.200
Your ex-husband.

27:27.080 --> 27:28.800
Hang in there!

27:32.000 --> 27:33.280
-Load!
-Now!

27:37.480 --> 27:38.960
We're Romeo and Juliet!

27:39.240 --> 27:40.600
We're Bonnie and Clyde!

27:40.880 --> 27:41.760
We are

27:42.120 --> 27:43.480
the Lovers of Teruel!

27:47.440 --> 27:49.480
He's requests full custody
of your daughter.

27:49.560 --> 27:54.400
And if a judge finds you guilty
of the charges held against you,

27:55.320 --> 27:57.240
it will be automatically granted.

27:57.520 --> 28:00.880
And if he is indeed
the abuser you say he is,

28:01.320 --> 28:03.000
your daughter will be in trouble.

28:08.720 --> 28:09.600
Load!

28:09.720 --> 28:10.600
Now!

28:15.520 --> 28:17.600
You son of a bitch, motherfucker,

28:18.120 --> 28:19.240
fucking bastard.

28:20.400 --> 28:22.840
Intelligence can drop all charges.

28:23.760 --> 28:27.680
I'm Intelligence. But don't ask
for more guarantees than my word

28:27.800 --> 28:31.320
because the offer will be gone
if the kidnappers get away.

28:32.360 --> 28:35.080
And that could happen in a few minutes.

28:35.560 --> 28:36.440
Let's go.

28:45.000 --> 28:45.920
So choose,

28:46.640 --> 28:47.520
your daughter

28:48.240 --> 28:50.680
or a guy you didn't know just last week.

28:56.520 --> 28:59.160
Lobo, we can't contain that machine gun!

28:59.320 --> 29:00.720
We have to take it out!

29:02.040 --> 29:03.360
Hand grenade!

29:07.080 --> 29:07.960
Load!

29:08.040 --> 29:08.880
Now!

29:10.120 --> 29:11.080
Take cover!

29:13.840 --> 29:14.760
Look out, let's go!

29:15.480 --> 29:18.360
Come on, take cover! Go!

29:19.680 --> 29:20.560
Take cover!

29:31.560 --> 29:32.480
You're here.

29:32.800 --> 29:33.960
You're finally here.

29:35.320 --> 29:36.280
Where's Berlin?

29:36.520 --> 29:37.560
He stayed inside.

29:41.560 --> 29:44.080
-What do you mean?
-The GEO's were on us

29:44.400 --> 29:46.480
and he was determined to cover the tunnel.

29:48.400 --> 29:49.520
He saved our lives.

29:55.040 --> 29:56.080
Clear. Formation!

30:18.680 --> 30:19.960
Surprise!

30:23.320 --> 30:24.480
It's him, get down!

30:38.120 --> 30:39.680
You don't have much time left.

30:40.400 --> 30:42.480
Not only will you lose your daughter,

30:42.560 --> 30:44.360
you'll be throwing your life away.

30:44.680 --> 30:45.640
Give me that address.

30:49.320 --> 30:50.640
Give me that address!

30:53.520 --> 30:54.960
33 Alcantara.

30:58.960 --> 31:01.360
33 Alcantara, everyone over there!

31:12.680 --> 31:13.640
Andres!

31:17.200 --> 31:18.040
Andres!

31:18.520 --> 31:19.440
Professor?

31:19.880 --> 31:20.760
Fire!

31:22.600 --> 31:24.440
I'm a little busy now!

31:29.240 --> 31:30.080
Enter the tunnel.

31:32.600 --> 31:33.600
Negative!

31:35.840 --> 31:36.880
Andres,

31:37.520 --> 31:39.840
we're going to blow the tunnel.
Get out.

31:40.720 --> 31:42.320
They're closing in, it's too late.

31:42.400 --> 31:43.320
Move forward!

31:44.600 --> 31:45.800
Leave now!

31:48.680 --> 31:50.760
I'm not leaving without you,
you know that.

31:51.200 --> 31:52.200
Clip!

31:52.680 --> 31:53.600
Move forward!

31:57.200 --> 31:58.520
Old age isn't for me.

32:02.200 --> 32:05.600
Imagine me drooling
or losing sphincter control?

32:06.440 --> 32:07.600
No.

32:07.960 --> 32:09.960
That takes courage. I prefer this.

32:13.800 --> 32:14.920
Get out, please.

32:15.120 --> 32:15.960
Sergio!

32:16.440 --> 32:17.400
Don't give me that.

32:17.640 --> 32:21.080
You promised to not stick around
if things got ugly, and they did.

32:23.040 --> 32:24.000
Helsinki,

32:25.480 --> 32:26.520
blow the tunnel.

32:28.040 --> 32:29.200
No, no.

32:32.880 --> 32:33.720
Get down!

32:34.480 --> 32:36.960
Helsinki, it's an order.
Soldier, blow it!

32:37.560 --> 32:39.000
No. Don't do it!

32:39.480 --> 32:42.160
Helsinki, it's an order.
Soldier, blow the tunnel!

32:42.840 --> 32:44.680
-Professor...
-No, Helsinki!

32:45.040 --> 32:47.640
I love you, little brother.
Don't forget it.

32:47.720 --> 32:49.160
Professor!

32:52.240 --> 32:53.160
Helsinki!

32:53.240 --> 32:54.080
Andres!

32:58.960 --> 33:00.440
Andres, please!

33:00.520 --> 33:03.400
I've spent my life being
a bit of an asshole, but today...

33:07.240 --> 33:09.080
I think I feel like dying with dignity.

33:11.200 --> 33:12.400
No!

33:17.120 --> 33:18.280
Let's go, give him hell!

33:32.040 --> 33:32.920
Professor.

33:48.240 --> 33:49.120
Open!

34:03.560 --> 34:04.640
Fonollosa is down.

34:05.120 --> 34:06.800
I repeat, Fonollosa is down.

34:27.600 --> 34:28.480
Professor,

34:29.440 --> 34:30.440
listen.

34:32.760 --> 34:33.920
We must keep going.

34:35.600 --> 34:36.640
We must keep going.

34:39.400 --> 34:40.480
We must keep going.

34:45.080 --> 34:47.040
Colonel, units headed to 33 Alcantara.

34:47.320 --> 34:48.960
300 meters from the target.

34:55.800 --> 34:56.960
Change your clothes.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.560
Turning onto Alcantara street.

35:12.640 --> 35:14.160
We've reached the target.

35:35.640 --> 35:36.880
We're inside the hangar.

35:37.640 --> 35:40.560
Search the area.
Melero, Sanz to the left. Ribero, with me.

35:43.080 --> 35:43.920
Melero?

35:44.040 --> 35:44.960
It's clear.

35:48.120 --> 35:49.760
-Sanz?
-It's clear.

35:52.920 --> 35:54.960
-Ribero?
-Clear!

36:03.400 --> 36:04.440
Confirmed, Colonel.

36:05.400 --> 36:06.640
There's no one here.

36:07.760 --> 36:08.960
The hangar is empty.

36:34.560 --> 36:36.480
WEDNESDAY 06:28 PM

36:40.840 --> 36:42.760
128 HOURS

36:45.280 --> 36:47.320
END OF THE HEIST

36:57.000 --> 36:58.880
1 MINUTE EARLIER

37:21.640 --> 37:23.520
2 MINUTES EARLIER

37:38.120 --> 37:40.000
5 MINUTES EARLIER

37:58.080 --> 37:59.960

38:26.320 --> 38:27.440

38:30.440 --> 38:33.120
Professor!

38:42.440 --> 38:44.520
365 DAYS SINCE THE HEIST

38:44.600 --> 38:47.680
It's been one year since the heist
at the Royal Mint of Spain.

38:47.880 --> 38:50.480
Considered the greatest robbery
of all times

38:50.760 --> 38:52.120
remains unsolved.

38:52.200 --> 38:55.120
Just like the unknown
whereabouts of the heist men,

38:55.400 --> 38:58.560
who got away with over one billion euros.

38:58.840 --> 39:02.000
Although the authorities
condemned the heist,

39:02.280 --> 39:06.080
the public still thinks
their actions were legitimate

39:06.760 --> 39:09.320
a protest against
the established order,

39:09.840 --> 39:12.240
which generated polemic
on social media.

39:12.400 --> 39:13.880
The most well-known case

39:13.960 --> 39:16.000
was that of Chief Police Inspector then,

39:16.080 --> 39:19.840
Raquel Murillo, who left the force after
controversial statements to the media,

39:20.480 --> 39:22.080
in which she disapproved

39:22.160 --> 39:25.760
of the way the National Intelligence Corp
handled the crisis.

39:28.600 --> 39:29.440
Let's leave.

39:30.440 --> 39:32.640
Let's take off to some country
in the Caribbean.

39:32.720 --> 39:33.640
It's just that,

39:34.120 --> 39:35.160
it's so crazy that...

39:36.440 --> 39:38.280
I can't see myself
doing anything else.

39:41.200 --> 39:42.200
Pick one.

39:44.160 --> 39:45.120
Palawan.

42:14.040 --> 42:15.320
If it's important,

42:20.040 --> 42:21.480
you can use mine.

44:04.520 --> 44:06.480
