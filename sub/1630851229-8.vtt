Winston's recovering.
You saved his life.

-Congrats on the book.

00:15.499 --> 00:17.924
No. No.
Too busy operating.

00:18.077 --> 00:19.351
Just gearing up
to be chief again.

00:19.578 --> 00:22.187
Well, I hear Kit is still
considering candidates.

00:22.414 --> 00:24.857
-Mm.
-I would know. I am one.

00:25.084 --> 00:26.083
I know you're both eager

00:26.101 --> 00:28.343
who our next
chief of surgery will be,

00:28.362 --> 00:30.937

It won't be either of you.

Randolph, you remember
the mantra.

Dr. Sutton can have that job.

The phone calls, the paperwork,

check in with triage?

04:24.172 --> 04:25.931
that he wants a playdate,
by the way.

04:26.158 --> 04:27.248
Ah, right, yeah.
We're supposed to do those.

04:27.268 --> 04:30.176
Kids social calendars are crazy.

gets a date of her own first?

04:33.015 --> 04:34.273
-(laughs)
-Yeah, sure, sure.

04:34.424 --> 04:37.943
Alec just told me that his mommy

04:38.094 --> 04:40.595
is a nurse,
like my mommy, right?

04:40.689 --> 04:41.838
Yeah. That's right.

04:41.931 --> 04:45.266
Do you take blood?
And do the squeezy thing?

04:45.286 --> 04:47.602
She means the
blood pressure cuff.

04:47.621 --> 04:48.678
Oh.

04:48.697 --> 04:50.847
I sure do.

04:50.940 --> 04:54.184
You know, you should come visit
the nurse's station today.

04:54.277 --> 04:56.036
See us in action, hm?

04:56.188 --> 04:58.797
Maybe you could both stop by?

04:58.948 --> 05:01.191
Can we, Daddy? Can we?

05:01.284 --> 05:03.376
Yeah, I guess we can do a bring
your daughter to work day.

05:03.529 --> 05:04.803
Yes!

05:05.030 --> 05:07.121
Fabulous! I can't wait.

05:07.141 --> 05:10.884
It is so great to have
you back, Dr. Hawkins.

05:11.036 --> 05:12.811
Should I call you Conrad?

05:12.962 --> 05:14.462
I mean, now that
our kids are friends.

05:14.481 --> 05:16.982
Uh, Conrad's fine.

05:17.133 --> 05:19.526
See you both later.
Right?

05:20.970 --> 05:23.137
(chuckles)

05:23.231 --> 05:24.881
She was super nice.

05:24.974 --> 05:26.533
Yeah, she was.

05:31.648 --> 05:34.240
Oh, good, you're both here.

05:34.393 --> 05:36.150
I'd like to introduce you

05:36.170 --> 05:38.895
to Dr. Sofia DeSoto,

05:38.988 --> 05:40.914
double board certified in trauma

05:41.066 --> 05:43.900
and cardiothoracic surgery.
Also,

05:43.993 --> 05:45.326
a full professor at Emory.

05:45.346 --> 05:47.179
Wow. Well, welcome to Chastain.

05:47.330 --> 05:49.406
Are you joining our department?

05:49.499 --> 05:52.500
No. Dr. DeSoto
is a surgical coach,

05:52.519 --> 05:55.837
and you two
are her first students.

05:55.931 --> 05:58.415
Excuse me?

05:58.433 --> 06:01.342
Top athletes and artists
all have coaches.

06:01.436 --> 06:03.920
Roger Federer, Michael Phelps,
even Beyoncé has one.

06:04.013 --> 06:05.605
So why not surgeons?

06:05.699 --> 06:07.941
-Well...
-KIT: Atul Gawande,
a primary force

06:08.093 --> 06:11.203
in the patient safety movement,
thinks it's key.

06:11.430 --> 06:13.597
Well, when I run into Atul,
I'll let him know

06:13.690 --> 06:16.708
that my triple board certified
skills remain as sharp as ever.

06:16.935 --> 06:19.360
I have the lowest complication
rate here at Chastain.

06:19.380 --> 06:22.439
I know, and your rate
used to go down every month,

06:22.457 --> 06:24.441
but, lately,
it's been inching up.

06:24.534 --> 06:28.111
Well, it's understandable, given
your recent brush with fame.

06:28.130 --> 06:30.872
-Book signings...
-No, no, that's not fair, Kit.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.874
I take on complicated patients

06:32.893 --> 06:33.967
lesser surgeons won't.

06:34.136 --> 06:36.970
We both take risky cases,
and I'm-I'm sorry,

06:37.064 --> 06:38.880
but she's... (chuckles)

06:38.899 --> 06:40.974
clearly less experienced
than we are.

06:41.068 --> 06:42.308
Dr. Bell.

06:42.461 --> 06:43.568
Hi.

06:43.795 --> 06:44.978
Dr. Austin.

06:45.072 --> 06:47.313
It's a pleasure
to meet you both.

06:47.466 --> 06:49.315
My job here is to watch you two

06:49.468 --> 06:51.301
in ways you can't
watch yourselves,

06:51.394 --> 06:53.987
to point out tiny flaws
before they become big ones.

06:54.139 --> 06:56.306
Surely neither of you
thinks you're perfect?

06:56.399 --> 06:58.083
Probably the wrong question
for this crowd.

06:58.234 --> 06:59.918
DeSOTO:
How would each of you rate

07:00.145 --> 07:01.144
your performance
in this morning's

07:01.163 --> 07:03.146
pancreatic mass resection?

07:03.165 --> 07:05.148
Hey, that patient will be fine.

07:05.167 --> 07:08.409
"Fine" hardly seems like a goal
worthy of the illustrious

07:08.429 --> 07:09.836
Dr. AJ Austin.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.988
Does the back of your book
say you're just

07:12.007 --> 07:13.932
an okay doctor
at Chastain Memorial?

07:14.159 --> 07:16.009
When you're ready,

07:16.161 --> 07:17.418
let's meet in the conference
room to review footage

07:17.438 --> 07:18.437
of your latest surgery.

07:18.588 --> 07:21.014
Well, wait, that tape
gets deleted.

07:21.166 --> 07:23.925
Not today, Dr. Bell.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.593
Cheer up,

07:25.612 --> 07:27.654
this'll be fun.

07:29.508 --> 07:32.433
I always love
the first day of school.

07:32.527 --> 07:35.537
Make sure to get a seat
right up front.

07:40.185 --> 07:42.109
DEVON:
Mr. Crisforth.

07:42.129 --> 07:44.020
Looks like you had
a stroke last year.

07:44.039 --> 07:46.372
A small one.
I'm working my way back.

07:46.525 --> 07:48.374
Look here.

07:48.469 --> 07:51.695
Your wife says it's been
difficult to care for you.

07:51.713 --> 07:54.806
She said that? Celeste?

07:55.033 --> 07:57.033
(sighs) Your balance
never recovered.

07:57.126 --> 07:58.368
We have to use the wheelchair,

07:58.386 --> 08:00.812
otherwise you fall.
And when you do,

08:01.039 --> 08:02.314
I can't lift you anymore.

08:02.541 --> 08:06.376
She's exaggerating.
I can walk fine when I have to.

08:06.394 --> 08:08.545
-Whoa, whoa. I got you.
-Oh, George.

08:08.563 --> 08:10.197
-George.
-George.

08:11.550 --> 08:13.216
(winces)

08:13.235 --> 08:15.160
DEVON:
George.

08:15.311 --> 08:17.570
Tell me, how is your appetite?

08:17.664 --> 08:19.331
I eat when the food is good.

08:19.558 --> 08:21.891
I cook him everything
he used to like.

08:21.985 --> 08:23.059
He doesn't want it.

08:23.152 --> 08:25.003
And he doesn't sleep.
He's up,

08:25.154 --> 08:26.838
he's down,
every hour around the clock.

08:27.065 --> 08:28.507
Which means you are, too.

08:30.235 --> 08:32.177
His vitals are normal.

08:32.328 --> 08:34.161
I told you I was fine.

08:34.256 --> 08:36.014
All right, what kind of help
do you guys have at home?

08:36.165 --> 08:37.240
CELESTE:
None.

08:37.259 --> 08:38.925
I tried to get
a home health aide,

08:39.077 --> 08:41.002
but Medicare
wouldn't pay for it,

08:41.096 --> 08:42.187
only for hospitalization,

08:42.414 --> 08:44.189
and we've gone through
our savings.

08:44.382 --> 08:46.674
GEORGE:
That's what we get for
dedicating our lives to the

08:46.768 --> 08:49.176
American justice system.
You know the ACLU had us

08:49.196 --> 08:50.754
on speed dial?
We defended

08:50.772 --> 08:54.015
every anti-war protestor
in a thousand-mile radius.

08:54.034 --> 08:57.035
You're both lawyers?
That's impressive.

08:57.262 --> 08:58.945
We'll be right back.

08:59.097 --> 09:00.947
Hang tight, George.

09:01.099 --> 09:03.933
(sighs)

09:04.027 --> 09:06.027
(sighs)
This happens way too often--

09:06.121 --> 09:08.621
elderly couples are bankrupt
by health care bills,

09:08.774 --> 09:11.216
and one spouse is forced
to do everything for the other.

09:11.443 --> 09:13.534
Medicare's no help
unless they're hospitalized.

09:13.554 --> 09:14.961
Exactly.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.613
And George is stable.

09:16.706 --> 09:18.281
I know.

09:18.374 --> 09:20.617
Celeste is the one
hanging on by a thread,

09:20.710 --> 09:22.209
and stats show that

09:22.229 --> 09:23.970
the burden of caregiving
falls on women.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.212
Nothing you're saying is wrong.

09:25.381 --> 09:28.641
-She needs our help.
-Except that. She needs

09:28.735 --> 09:30.735
someone's help, but we
treat people who are sick.

09:30.962 --> 09:34.647
As of now, there's no medical
reason to admit her husband.

09:34.800 --> 09:36.466
I mean, you're right.

09:36.484 --> 09:39.160
I often am.

09:40.396 --> 09:43.898
Let's call in a social worker.

09:43.992 --> 09:45.491
-(beep)
-AMBER: See those lines?

09:45.644 --> 09:46.567
-Yeah.
-There you go.

09:46.661 --> 09:47.994
-And see those bars?
-Yeah.

09:48.237 --> 09:51.648
So, that is how I can tell
how fast your heart is beating.

09:51.741 --> 09:53.499
I think my heart is very strong.

09:53.652 --> 09:56.152
(laughs) So strong.

09:56.171 --> 09:57.837
Just like your daddy's.

09:57.989 --> 10:00.432
(chuckles)

10:03.495 --> 10:04.603
Gigi, honey,

10:04.754 --> 10:08.164
next stop on the nurses tour,

10:08.183 --> 10:11.610
come and see how we examine
a patient. (laughs)

10:11.761 --> 10:13.353
-Thank you.
-No worries.

10:13.447 --> 10:17.173
Bay Two, abdominal pain,
says she's cool with kids.

10:17.266 --> 10:19.175
-Hello.
-Hi.

10:19.194 --> 10:20.601
I'm Dr. Hawkins.

10:20.695 --> 10:22.436
This is my intern for the day,

10:22.530 --> 10:24.605
Gigi Hawkins,
and you've already met

10:24.625 --> 10:25.606
the most important person

10:25.700 --> 10:27.200
in the ER, Nurse Hundley.

10:27.294 --> 10:28.368
-(whoops)
-(laughs)

10:28.611 --> 10:31.187
Wow, Gigi, you graduated
med school way young.

10:31.206 --> 10:33.206
-You must be a genius.
-(giggles)

10:33.358 --> 10:34.916
Tell me, what happened?

10:34.968 --> 10:37.802
Oh, I bailed off
a frontside 180.

10:38.029 --> 10:39.954
Okay.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.455
Goofy foot rail grind?

10:41.475 --> 10:42.807
How can you tell?

10:43.034 --> 10:44.625
You braced your fall
with your left hand.

10:44.719 --> 10:45.869
You wearing a helmet?

10:45.962 --> 10:48.146
Duh. My hand's fine.

10:48.297 --> 10:50.464
What really hurts is in here.

10:50.558 --> 10:52.192
Let's take a look.

10:54.988 --> 10:57.380
(laughs) Sorry.

10:57.399 --> 11:00.550
Daddy, I think you found
her tickle spot.

11:00.568 --> 11:02.327
(laughs)

11:02.478 --> 11:04.979
You. Uh,

11:04.998 --> 11:07.073
-try to relax.
-(laughs)

11:07.225 --> 11:09.409
Allow me, Dr. Hawkins.

11:09.561 --> 11:10.502
This little trick,

11:10.729 --> 11:13.229
it fools the patient's body

11:13.248 --> 11:15.173
into thinking the pressure's
coming from their own hand,

11:15.400 --> 11:17.550
which takes away the tickle.

11:19.921 --> 11:20.995
Look at that.

11:21.089 --> 11:23.239
You are a magician.

11:23.258 --> 11:26.242
-(laughs)
-No, Daddy, she's a nurse.

11:26.261 --> 11:28.261
Same thing, little one.
(mouth pops)

11:28.355 --> 11:31.338
Your abdominal exam's fine.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.599
X-ray does show a fractured rib,
but with a little time

11:33.694 --> 11:34.842
and some rest,
it should heal on its own.

11:34.861 --> 11:37.420
Nurse Hundley
can give you 650 milligrams

11:37.439 --> 11:38.363
of acetaminophen
to help you with the pain.

11:38.514 --> 11:41.199
-You're good to go.
-Cool. Thanks.

11:41.350 --> 11:42.942
Think you're going
to get better soon.

11:43.036 --> 11:46.429
-(laughs)
-Okay, you. Next patient.

11:46.448 --> 11:48.415
(growls)

11:51.102 --> 11:53.453
George and Celeste,

11:53.547 --> 11:55.196
this is Winston Robards.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.882
He is Chastain's
best social worker.

11:58.034 --> 12:00.051
He was actually a patient here
himself a few years ago.

12:00.278 --> 12:02.128
Dr. Pravesh and I
almost died together.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.279
Great way to meet someone.

12:03.372 --> 12:05.372
DEVON:
And Winston had every right

12:05.467 --> 12:07.283
to sue Chastain
for what happened, but instead,

12:07.376 --> 12:08.952
he told our CEO
how we could make

12:09.045 --> 12:11.304
the hospital experience better
for people with disabilities,

12:11.456 --> 12:13.898
and it turns out
we needed a new social worker

12:14.050 --> 12:14.974
and she hired him on the spot.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.067
Well, it was a few months later,

12:16.294 --> 12:17.460
but I like the way
you tell the story.

12:17.479 --> 12:19.479
-(chuckles)
-(Winston clears throat) Now,

12:19.631 --> 12:21.722
it is my job to ensure

12:21.742 --> 12:23.983
that the both of you get
the best possible care.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.134
So, we will come up with a plan

12:25.153 --> 12:26.469
to make sure
that the two of you...

12:26.580 --> 12:29.080
I don't want anyone but Celeste
taking care of me, okay?

12:29.232 --> 12:31.249
So, if that's not your plan,

12:31.400 --> 12:32.976
I can tell you right now
to forget it.

12:32.994 --> 12:34.477
-Right, Celeste?
-WINSTON: Well, the plan

12:34.496 --> 12:35.587
will be for you both.

12:35.814 --> 12:37.905
So, I would like to get
a thorough history.

12:37.999 --> 12:39.406
Dr. Pravesh, you can leave us

12:39.426 --> 12:41.317
and go doctor elsewhere.
Shoo.

12:41.410 --> 12:43.261
He's gonna take
good care of you.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.640
(indistinct announcement
over P.A)

12:51.663 --> 12:52.687
Here you go, sweetheart.

12:54.165 --> 12:55.756
You must be Gigi.

12:55.776 --> 12:57.091
I'm nurse Valerie.

12:57.335 --> 13:01.004
I heard you were visiting today,
so I brought some cookies

13:01.022 --> 13:02.171
for you...

13:02.265 --> 13:04.598
and for your daddy.

13:04.618 --> 13:06.359
Can I have a cookie,

13:06.453 --> 13:09.103
-Daddy, please?
-Just one.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.955
-Thanks.
-VALERIE: Okay if I take her

13:11.107 --> 13:12.957
on a little tour?
To the break room?

13:13.184 --> 13:15.368
-Kids love that.
-Can I go, Daddy?

13:15.520 --> 13:18.279
-Okay.
-You can pick her up anytime,

13:18.298 --> 13:20.690
and stay as long as you want.

13:20.708 --> 13:21.949
Come on.

13:21.968 --> 13:24.427
-Have fun.
-GIGI: Thanks, Daddy.

13:25.880 --> 13:29.123
I bet nurses are really hovering
around Gigi today, huh?

13:29.142 --> 13:31.367
-Yeah.
-And you.

13:31.460 --> 13:32.626
(groans)

13:32.720 --> 13:34.203
Wonder what that's about.

13:34.297 --> 13:36.889
Well, you're a really great
diagnostician,

13:37.042 --> 13:38.465
so I'm sure you'll

13:38.485 --> 13:41.302
-make sense of it.
-(chuckles)

13:41.396 --> 13:42.970
Winston.

13:43.064 --> 13:44.397
You're gonna tell me
to admit him,

13:44.716 --> 13:47.233
but his labs just came back
normal, and he doesn't have any

13:47.327 --> 13:49.886
-medical reasons
to warrant an admission.
-So find one.

13:49.904 --> 13:51.162
My man.

13:51.314 --> 13:53.239
Winston always
cuts to the chase.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.982
Good to hear your voice,
Dr. Hawkins.

13:55.001 --> 13:56.334
Would you please
tell my friend here that,

13:56.485 --> 13:58.169
ironically, Medicare will pay

13:58.396 --> 14:01.414
tens of thousands of dollars
for a hospital admission,

14:01.566 --> 14:02.990
but not hundreds

14:03.009 --> 14:04.175
for a home health aide,
and without one,

14:04.402 --> 14:06.903
we cannot send this couple home.

14:06.996 --> 14:08.404
George is a fall risk.

14:08.497 --> 14:11.683
Celeste is suffering
from exhaustion and depression.

14:11.834 --> 14:13.409
-Winston says that you need...
-I heard. I heard.

14:13.502 --> 14:16.170
-And I agree, but we...
-Every admission

14:16.189 --> 14:18.690
takes resources
from other needier patients.

14:18.841 --> 14:21.842
We can't just help every
old person who walks in here.

14:21.936 --> 14:24.437
We have to discharge George.

14:24.589 --> 14:25.605
No.

14:25.773 --> 14:27.940
No. (stammers) You can't.
If you send us home,

14:28.034 --> 14:30.535
what will I do?

14:30.686 --> 14:32.537
You have to please take him.

14:32.688 --> 14:34.097
I mean, I am begging you.

14:34.115 --> 14:35.189
Please, take him.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.600
Celeste, would you
like to have a seat?

14:37.619 --> 14:40.295
We're gonna take care
of you, okay?

14:41.882 --> 14:43.197
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.133
What can you admit George for?

14:48.463 --> 14:50.296
Well, we know
he's prone to falls.

14:50.448 --> 14:54.208
That could speak
to a neurologic issue.

14:54.227 --> 14:55.968
He might need a CT scan.

14:56.121 --> 14:58.045
That's a grand idea.

14:58.064 --> 15:00.064
The magic box.
Everyone gets a CT scan.

15:00.291 --> 15:01.715
Medicare never questions that.

15:01.809 --> 15:04.551
That should buy us some time.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.571
Okay, let's do it.

15:20.328 --> 15:22.086
What do you think
she's writing back there?

15:24.315 --> 15:27.150
At four minutes,
Dr. Austin performs a textbook

15:27.243 --> 15:30.094
-lymph node dissection. (laughs)
-(Bell laugh)

15:31.431 --> 15:32.321
Okay.

15:32.415 --> 15:35.174
I think we've seen enough.

15:35.326 --> 15:37.343
We haven't even come
to the complication.

15:37.495 --> 15:39.586
Yeah, he's right.
E-Everything up to this point

15:39.681 --> 15:40.772
has been technically flawless.

15:40.999 --> 15:43.566
Hm. Not technically.

15:44.686 --> 15:45.944
Dr. Bell,

15:46.171 --> 15:47.336
I noticed you're ambidextrous,

15:47.430 --> 15:49.430
but you favor your left hand
while you operate.

15:49.524 --> 15:52.133
If you learn to switch,
you'd move faster, which could

15:52.193 --> 15:54.435
save a life in a crisis.

15:54.454 --> 15:57.104
And you both just take
the instruments you want

15:57.123 --> 15:59.106
off the table,
instead of asking for them.

15:59.125 --> 16:01.108
That costs precious seconds,

16:01.202 --> 16:03.369
and nurses hate it.

16:03.521 --> 16:04.353
Uh, Dr. Austin,

16:04.372 --> 16:06.447
when you need better retraction,

16:06.541 --> 16:07.948
you tend to stop
what you're doing

16:07.968 --> 16:10.026
and reposition
the retractor yourself.

16:10.044 --> 16:11.285
Instead, you should
ask for help.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.212
You let an organ
drift out of the field...

16:13.306 --> 16:15.548
-No, I did not.
-You did,

16:15.700 --> 16:17.308
but you didn't notice
because you were reaching.

16:17.460 --> 16:19.218
Next time,
ask the anesthesiologist

16:19.370 --> 16:20.478
to turn the patient
left side up.

16:20.629 --> 16:22.129
It's small things,

16:22.148 --> 16:24.315
like bed positioning, that can
make all the difference.

16:24.467 --> 16:26.359
Is that all?

16:29.230 --> 16:30.321
What I've found is

16:30.548 --> 16:32.824
what most often stands
between a solid doctor

16:33.051 --> 16:35.234
and a spectacular one...

16:35.328 --> 16:37.386
is ego.

16:37.480 --> 16:38.663
(scoffs)

16:40.000 --> 16:41.240
And no, it's not all.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.292
We've got a page
and a half to go.

16:49.492 --> 16:51.901
See? Right there.

16:51.994 --> 16:55.179
Your grumpy civil rights lawyer
has a small subdural hematoma.

16:55.331 --> 16:57.348
Great. Something we can fix.

16:57.575 --> 16:59.575
That can help George
and his wife.

16:59.594 --> 17:00.667
It's a small brain bleed,

17:00.762 --> 17:02.002
likely not the cause
of George's issues,

17:02.096 --> 17:04.522
nor does it justify
cracking open his skull.

17:04.673 --> 17:06.173
Come on.

17:06.267 --> 17:07.358
Another hospital would operate

17:07.585 --> 17:10.010
and cash that fat
Medicare reimbursement, but

17:10.030 --> 17:12.012
he's, what, 78?

17:12.106 --> 17:13.756
The bleed could resorb
on its own.

17:13.775 --> 17:16.850
If we take him to surgery, he
might not make it off the table.

17:16.870 --> 17:18.202
Is that what you want?

17:18.429 --> 17:20.279
Wild guess,
that question was rhetorical.

17:20.373 --> 17:23.857
When the air hits your brain,
you're never the same.

17:23.877 --> 17:26.544
We don't cut in my OR
unless we have to.

17:28.623 --> 17:30.122
Man, I hate this case.

17:30.216 --> 17:33.051
George's conditions are chronic.
I can't cure old age.

17:33.278 --> 17:35.628
I'm a doctor who can't doctor.

17:35.780 --> 17:38.181
You must see patients like this
all the time in the ER.

17:39.450 --> 17:41.041
Far too often.

17:42.120 --> 17:44.228
There are days
that leave me yearning for...

17:44.380 --> 17:45.955
A scalpel?

17:45.973 --> 17:47.957
Spreadsheets.

17:47.975 --> 17:50.476
-Data.
-Oh, right.

17:50.628 --> 17:51.903
I forgot you're a nerd.

17:52.054 --> 17:54.197
-(both chuckle)
-It's not just that.

17:55.300 --> 17:58.301
I miss the hunt for new cures.

17:58.394 --> 18:00.894
Do you remember my patient
with sickle cell, Rose?

18:00.988 --> 18:02.822
She made me want
to pursue clinical trials,

18:02.916 --> 18:04.916
but I...

18:05.067 --> 18:06.642
-(sighs)
-But what?

18:06.735 --> 18:09.587
You can still have your wish.

18:09.738 --> 18:11.071
Do research.

18:11.091 --> 18:14.150
You know, just because
you landed in the ER

18:14.243 --> 18:16.177
doesn't mean you have to stay.

18:18.656 --> 18:20.431
(sighs)

18:20.658 --> 18:22.141
(typing)

18:25.438 --> 18:27.438
Here you go.

18:30.017 --> 18:32.276
<i> Et tu,</i> Kit?

18:32.428 --> 18:34.112
Having a tough day, darling?

18:34.263 --> 18:36.280
No.
Now, AJ, I understand.

18:36.432 --> 18:39.266
I mean, he can be taken down
a couple of pegs with his book

18:39.285 --> 18:42.603
and the TV appearances,
but do I really need this?

18:42.697 --> 18:43.788
Randolph,

18:44.015 --> 18:46.773
this isn't personal, I swear.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.367
Hospitals around the country
are bringing in coaches,

18:48.519 --> 18:50.035
and I want
to be on the forefront.

18:50.188 --> 18:54.023
I get that, I do, but

18:54.041 --> 18:55.708
we're in a relationship,

18:55.802 --> 18:59.362
so maybe talk things through
with me before I get blindsided

18:59.455 --> 19:01.455
-next to a colleague.
-You made me promise

19:01.474 --> 19:04.458
I wouldn't let you go the way
of your old friend Kranepool.

19:04.477 --> 19:08.295
Fade away
into surgical oblivion.

19:08.389 --> 19:11.390
If other doctors see the great
Dr. Bell being coached,

19:11.484 --> 19:14.377
they'll be more open
to the possibility, and Chastain

19:14.395 --> 19:17.155
will become a better
hospital for it.

19:17.306 --> 19:20.974
So, anyway, how was her advice?

19:20.994 --> 19:22.493
Helpful?

19:24.664 --> 19:28.557
Oh, so it was good advice.

19:28.576 --> 19:30.835

(laughing):
I'm telling you,

20:23.297 --> 20:25.965
-every nurse...
-Of course.

20:26.117 --> 20:27.874
-Where's Gigi?
-(gasps)

20:27.969 --> 20:29.543
Gigi's back in preschool.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.395
She had a ball.
Didn't want to leave.

20:34.792 --> 20:36.567
What was so funny just now?

20:38.813 --> 20:42.240
Hundley was just filling me in
on the adventures of Chastain's

20:42.391 --> 20:44.633
-most eligible bachelor.
-HUNDLEY: It's like
when they put chum

20:44.727 --> 20:46.077
in the water to attract sharks.

20:46.304 --> 20:49.080
Yeah, a nurse feeding frenzy.
(laughs)

20:49.307 --> 20:51.323
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's not like that.

20:51.476 --> 20:54.310
Oh, the nurses
are swiping right on you,

20:54.403 --> 20:56.645
Dr. Hawkins, except for me,
that is. (laughing)

20:56.664 --> 20:58.647
Hey, I'm right here.

20:58.741 --> 21:00.983
I'm just saying,
watch your back.

21:00.985 --> 21:03.335
(Hundley laughs)

21:03.488 --> 21:05.429
Oh, come on,
you must have noticed.

21:05.656 --> 21:06.505
(chuckling): Maybe.

21:06.657 --> 21:08.307
(chuckles)

21:13.164 --> 21:15.180
I'm not ready for it.

21:15.333 --> 21:17.525
It's uncomfortable.

21:20.262 --> 21:22.338
Well, look, there's no rush.

21:22.356 --> 21:25.783
But it's been a few years,
you're allowed.

21:26.010 --> 21:27.118
If you want.

21:27.269 --> 21:28.344
I don't even know
where to begin.

21:28.362 --> 21:30.137
How does this even work anymore?

21:30.139 --> 21:32.790
Okay, Grandpa, how old are you?

21:32.941 --> 21:35.942
(both laugh)

21:35.962 --> 21:37.870
Yeah, do I ask her
to the town dance, or do I

21:37.964 --> 21:40.298
take her to a soda fountain?
I don't know.

21:41.950 --> 21:45.803
All I know is that Nic wouldn't
want you to be alone forever.

21:46.030 --> 21:48.431
For your sake, and for Gigi's.

21:50.384 --> 21:53.352
-You deserve to be happy.
-Thank you.

21:54.647 --> 21:57.398
That means a lot
coming from you.

22:05.716 --> 22:07.900
Very nice.

22:08.052 --> 22:09.401
That's me, that's my dog,

22:09.554 --> 22:12.479
even though Daddy says
no dog right now.

22:12.498 --> 22:14.073
(laughs)

22:14.167 --> 22:16.149
-And who's that?
-That...

22:16.169 --> 22:18.002
-Mm-hmm.
-...is Mommy.

22:18.229 --> 22:20.713
Oh, she's beautiful.
I bet you miss her.

22:22.583 --> 22:25.634
-Daddy says she watches over us.
-Yeah.

22:27.329 --> 22:30.330
Hey, baby.
Just checking in.

22:30.350 --> 22:31.849
Mwah.

22:32.076 --> 22:34.259
Look, Daddy, it's Marion.

22:34.354 --> 22:35.502
Yeah.

22:35.596 --> 22:38.189
-(chuckles)
-You come up a lot in our house.

22:38.340 --> 22:40.082
-Aw.
-She doesn't get why
you can't be

22:40.101 --> 22:41.174
her teacher forever.

22:41.268 --> 22:43.176
I'm still with the babies
in the daycare,

22:43.196 --> 22:46.072
but I promise to come visit
the big kids.

22:46.257 --> 22:48.348
Like today, this has been
a real treat.

22:48.368 --> 22:50.593
-(chuckles)
-(pager beeping)

22:50.686 --> 22:52.595
Mm, yeah,

22:52.688 --> 22:54.705
look at that.

22:54.932 --> 22:57.041
I got to go, sweetheart.

22:57.268 --> 22:59.192
Wait, Daddy, this is for you.

22:59.212 --> 23:00.285
Oh.

23:00.380 --> 23:02.195
Oh, you should frame that one.

23:02.289 --> 23:04.273
I don't know.
I look a little purple.

23:04.291 --> 23:05.791
(laughs)

23:05.943 --> 23:08.293
It's been great having Gigi.
Let me know if there's anything

23:08.446 --> 23:11.280
I can do to help
with the transition.

23:11.298 --> 23:12.631
Looks like you're
already doing it.

23:12.725 --> 23:14.207
(Marion chuckles)

23:14.301 --> 23:15.893
-Should we do another one?
-GIGI: Yeah.

23:16.120 --> 23:17.603
Okay.

23:26.130 --> 23:28.072
Ah, Dr. DeSoto.

23:28.299 --> 23:30.315
Uh, you mind if I take
a moment of your time?

23:30.410 --> 23:32.484
I'd like to go over
your morning thoughts.

23:32.637 --> 23:34.970
-Of course, how can I help?
-Well, you can't,

23:35.063 --> 23:36.747
and that's my first note.

23:36.974 --> 23:38.140
You see, I have

23:38.251 --> 23:41.160
made a rebuttal to each one
of your recommendations.

23:41.312 --> 23:43.996
Dr. Austin, today wasn't meant
to be punishment,

23:44.148 --> 23:46.315
and it shouldn't make you
defensive. It was--

23:46.333 --> 23:48.551
now, brace yourself--
just advice.

23:50.337 --> 23:54.098
Benjamin Franklin once said,
"Wise men don't need advice."

23:54.249 --> 23:56.082
"And fools won't take it."

23:56.177 --> 23:59.562
You thought I wouldn't know the
rest of that quote, didn't you?

24:02.833 --> 24:05.000
Who hurt you, Dr. DeSoto?

24:05.093 --> 24:06.502
I have a radical prediction.

24:06.520 --> 24:08.671
I think, when this is
all said and done,

24:08.689 --> 24:10.172
you're going to thank me.

24:10.265 --> 24:13.266
And I think you relish tearing
down accomplished surgeons.

24:13.286 --> 24:16.954
Maybe we should examine why.

24:17.105 --> 24:19.105
No need, I'm happy to tell you.

24:19.200 --> 24:21.350
I realized early on
that I'm a good surgeon,

24:21.368 --> 24:23.443
but not a great one.
What I am great at

24:23.463 --> 24:27.039
is making talented people
even better. That fulfills me.

24:27.133 --> 24:29.208
Brings me joy.

24:29.360 --> 24:30.876
Now, Dr. Voss suggested I work

24:31.028 --> 24:32.377
with you for the next two weeks.

24:32.530 --> 24:34.120
I could extend that time
another two weeks.

24:34.140 --> 24:37.032
Make it a month, total.

24:37.051 --> 24:40.227
Or you could just
let me eat my muffin.

24:47.987 --> 24:49.378
(sighs)

24:49.396 --> 24:51.380
What... How about
we go back to this one?

24:51.473 --> 24:53.398
No, no. That one's even lumpier.

24:53.493 --> 24:56.218
CLARA:
You know what? You are right.

24:56.237 --> 24:58.537
I will go find another.

25:00.057 --> 25:01.223
-How are you, George?
-(groans)

25:01.283 --> 25:04.076
Aside from our
unsatisfactory bed linens.

25:04.228 --> 25:07.563
I'm as fine as I was three hours
ago. I should be at home.

25:07.581 --> 25:10.174
-George, you have a brain bleed.
-Yeah, which is

25:10.401 --> 25:11.917
going nowhere
and doing nothing.

25:12.011 --> 25:13.660
That's what the doctor
said, right?

25:13.679 --> 25:15.179
There's no reason to be here.

25:15.330 --> 25:18.164
In fact, I'm leaving.

25:18.259 --> 25:20.476
Wait a second, George.

25:22.580 --> 25:24.004
See?

25:24.023 --> 25:25.481
I can walk just fine.

25:27.009 --> 25:28.508
Can you walk in the hall for me?

25:28.528 --> 25:30.194
GEORGE:
Okay.

25:35.368 --> 25:38.160
Okay, George,
come on back for me.

25:42.099 --> 25:43.541
All right, sit down.

25:47.529 --> 25:49.547
(sighs)

25:49.698 --> 25:51.131
Okay, stand up.

25:53.535 --> 25:56.445
George, do you find it difficult
to get moving

25:56.538 --> 25:57.704
after you stand up?

25:57.798 --> 26:00.299
Yes.

26:00.451 --> 26:01.708
And your muscles--
do they feel rigid?

26:01.727 --> 26:03.952
All the damn time.

26:04.046 --> 26:06.230
What is it?
What does that mean?

26:08.067 --> 26:11.293
Parkinson's?
Are you sure?

26:11.312 --> 26:14.146
Irregular arm swing
first tipped me off,

26:14.298 --> 26:16.982
but he also has
bradykinesia, rigidity.

26:17.134 --> 26:18.576
It's early, and we can help him
with medication,

26:18.803 --> 26:20.319
-but it's...
-It's progressive.

26:20.413 --> 26:21.970
Here I was,
looking for a problem

26:22.064 --> 26:24.397
to fix, and now all I've got

26:24.417 --> 26:26.584
-is a much bigger problem.
-Oh, that poor woman.

26:28.996 --> 26:30.421
All right,
let's divide and conquer.

26:30.648 --> 26:32.481
I'll stay with George,
get him an MRI.

26:32.574 --> 26:34.316
We'll see if we can
rule out anything else.

26:34.318 --> 26:35.467
I'll tag in with Celeste
and try to

26:35.653 --> 26:38.345
-figure out how we can help her.
-Okay.

26:40.099 --> 26:42.991
Dr. DeSoto.

26:43.085 --> 26:44.417
Oh, glad I found you.
Do you have a minute?

26:44.437 --> 26:45.436
Of course.

26:45.663 --> 26:47.179
I just wanted
a quick progress report

26:47.331 --> 26:49.273
on our two favorite pupils.

26:49.500 --> 26:51.591
Did I tell you that,
before I went to med school,

26:51.611 --> 26:53.018
I did Teach for America?

26:53.112 --> 26:55.020
Taught kindergarten
for two years,

26:55.114 --> 26:57.356
and I learned that,
when a child throws a tantrum,

26:57.508 --> 26:59.508
you have to let them
wear themselves out.

26:59.601 --> 27:01.935
Then they come around
in the end. (chuckles)

27:01.954 --> 27:04.437
An eerily apt metaphor.

27:04.531 --> 27:06.123
Um...

27:06.274 --> 27:08.350
If you don't mind my asking,
is it true

27:08.443 --> 27:11.019
you're in a relationship
with Dr. Bell?

27:11.038 --> 27:12.521
I am.

27:12.539 --> 27:15.040
But not to worry,
it's all on the up and up.

27:15.192 --> 27:17.876
HR is fully aware,
and we're both adults.

27:17.970 --> 27:19.044
Of course. It's just...

27:19.196 --> 27:21.955
in my experience,
a workplace romance

27:22.049 --> 27:25.200
between a CEO and a surgeon
can be a recipe for dysfunction

27:25.293 --> 27:27.202
-and I'm...
-Oh, I'm sorry.

27:27.221 --> 27:31.707
I wasn't aware you were also
board certified in psychiatry.

27:31.800 --> 27:33.709
Forgive me.

27:33.802 --> 27:36.061
I was afraid Dr. Bell might come
to you after meeting with me.

27:36.155 --> 27:37.971
Try to use your relationship

27:38.065 --> 27:39.715
to request special treatment.

27:39.733 --> 27:42.142
I wouldn't let that happen.

27:42.161 --> 27:44.903
As you can see,
advice is often not welcome,

27:44.997 --> 27:46.497
but it is well-intentioned.

27:51.319 --> 27:54.171
-(door knock)
-Celeste?

27:56.583 --> 27:58.467
-(wheezing)
-Celeste?

28:05.333 --> 28:06.666
Celeste?

28:06.760 --> 28:08.852
Celeste!

28:09.004 --> 28:11.647
Hey, I need some help in here!

28:17.512 --> 28:20.439
Brent Porter. 22-year-old
with abdominal trauma.

28:20.533 --> 28:23.592
Yeah, I can see that.
Put him in Bay Ten.

28:23.610 --> 28:27.187
What's the old saying?
"Kids in frat houses

28:27.206 --> 28:28.354
shouldn't throw each other
into glass tables"?

28:28.374 --> 28:30.523
Hard to believe,
but his vitals are stable.

28:30.617 --> 28:34.378
Okay, on my count,
slowly and very carefully.

28:34.605 --> 28:36.380
One, two, three.

28:36.531 --> 28:37.697
Good.

28:37.791 --> 28:39.032
(monitors beeping)

28:39.126 --> 28:42.110
So, two questions:
What happened?

28:42.204 --> 28:43.536
-And what are you on?
-JOSH: Nothing, dude.

28:43.630 --> 28:45.038
-We swear.
-Yeah, uh,

28:45.057 --> 28:46.782
we were just wrestling
to blow off some steam

28:46.842 --> 28:49.209
-before finals.
-That's what video games
are for.

28:49.228 --> 28:51.636
It's not their fault.
I should've moved the furniture.

28:51.731 --> 28:53.638
And I feel pretty okay.

28:53.791 --> 28:54.806
Is that weird?

28:55.017 --> 28:56.400
Well, you're either
very lucky or in shock,

28:56.551 --> 28:58.218
so let's find out which.
What's...

28:58.312 --> 29:01.221
-on you? It's sticky.
-That's just the suds.

29:01.315 --> 29:03.389
-Don't act like that's normal.
-JOSH: There was this baby pool

29:03.409 --> 29:06.059
-of soapy suds.
-It's like slippery wrestling.

29:06.078 --> 29:08.061
Okay, everyone
who doesn't work here

29:08.080 --> 29:09.654
or have glass in them, leave.

29:09.807 --> 29:12.140
So...

29:12.234 --> 29:13.308
-Brent? Hey.
-(monitors beeping quickly)

29:13.401 --> 29:15.143
-Brent.
-HUNDLEY: His heart's racing.

29:15.162 --> 29:17.087
-BP's dropping.
-Damn it.

29:17.239 --> 29:19.506
Not lucky, I guess.

29:20.818 --> 29:23.177
I hear breath sounds.

29:24.488 --> 29:26.079
And bowel sounds.

29:26.173 --> 29:27.506
He's got a ruptured diaphragm.

29:27.658 --> 29:29.600
Page trauma surgery now.

29:29.751 --> 29:31.351
All right, let's go.

29:34.164 --> 29:35.397
(groans softly)

29:36.683 --> 29:39.109
How we doing here?

29:39.261 --> 29:41.278
She's just coming around.

29:41.429 --> 29:43.505
Celeste, I'm Dr. Hawkins.
We met in the ER.

29:43.598 --> 29:45.357
Dr. Pravesh asked me
to work with you

29:45.451 --> 29:47.433
while he's helping
with your husband, okay?

29:47.453 --> 29:48.601
How you feeling?

29:48.695 --> 29:50.195
Eh, woozy.

29:50.347 --> 29:51.771
What-what happened?

29:51.791 --> 29:54.440
-You fainted.
-CONRAD: Blood and oxygen
stats were low.

29:54.460 --> 29:56.460
When did you last
visit the doctor?

29:56.687 --> 30:00.339
-Oh, we go all the time.
-Not we, you.

30:02.802 --> 30:04.635
I d... I-I don't remember.

30:06.363 --> 30:09.197
We're gonna get you a chest
X-ray and do some cardiac tests.

30:09.216 --> 30:11.716
Clara, could you send off
a troponin, and a CK-MB,

30:11.869 --> 30:14.460
and let's do
a 12-lead EKG as well.

30:14.555 --> 30:16.296
I'm on it.

30:16.315 --> 30:19.207
Uh, George will want me
to be with him.

30:19.226 --> 30:22.210
Um, are you gonna
transfer me to his room?

30:22.229 --> 30:24.613
You need to rest.

30:26.325 --> 30:29.326
You can't help George
if you aren't well, right?

30:29.477 --> 30:31.069
Um...

30:31.163 --> 30:34.206
(whispers):
Please don't put me in there.

30:37.837 --> 30:39.394
We weren't planning on it.

30:39.413 --> 30:42.989
It's... it's always
been the two of us.

30:43.083 --> 30:45.342
At home, in the office.

30:45.493 --> 30:48.679
We didn't have kids,
we just had each other.

30:50.090 --> 30:52.349
And now, I...

30:52.576 --> 30:54.000
I have no one. I...

30:54.019 --> 30:57.503
dress him, I feed him,
I clean him, and...

30:57.523 --> 31:01.507
(sighs) It's constant.
It just...

31:01.527 --> 31:02.675
it just never ends.

31:02.769 --> 31:05.195
CONRAD:
We hear you.

31:05.422 --> 31:07.698
I can't imagine
how hard that's been.

31:09.426 --> 31:12.870
Sometimes, when I wake up
in the morning...

31:13.097 --> 31:16.098
I look over, and I wish,

31:16.116 --> 31:19.618
just-just for a second,

31:19.770 --> 31:22.362
that he was gone.

31:22.497 --> 31:26.124
(sniffles) That he passed
peacefully in his sleep.

31:26.276 --> 31:28.552
And I could remember him

31:28.703 --> 31:30.703
how he used to be,

31:30.797 --> 31:33.473
when he cared about me.

31:35.469 --> 31:38.604
Does that make me
a terrible person?

31:41.458 --> 31:43.792
No.

31:43.885 --> 31:47.321
-That makes you human.
-(crying)

31:49.057 --> 31:50.324
Oh...

31:53.153 --> 31:54.912
We're gonna take care
of you both.

31:55.063 --> 31:57.664
-Promise.
-Thank you.

32:07.334 --> 32:09.742
BRENT:
I think I passed out.
Did I almost die?

32:09.836 --> 32:12.429
-No, you're still here.
-I-I don't understand. What...

32:12.580 --> 32:13.672
-What are you...
-Your guts are in your chest.

32:13.824 --> 32:15.006
<i> No bueno.</i>

32:15.159 --> 32:16.992
BELL:
But that's why we are
the best surgeons

32:17.085 --> 32:18.160
for this job.

32:18.253 --> 32:19.269
I'm an expert
in abdominal surgery.

32:19.496 --> 32:20.495
And I specialize

32:20.514 --> 32:22.347
in complicated heart
and lung cases.

32:22.499 --> 32:23.682
BELL:
So any abdominal organs
that have made

32:23.776 --> 32:24.975
their way into the chest...

32:25.127 --> 32:26.518
It's our bread and butter, baby.

32:26.670 --> 32:27.611
Dr. DeSoto.

32:27.762 --> 32:29.521
Doctors.

32:29.673 --> 32:30.739
Who's she?

32:32.785 --> 32:33.692
She's just an observer.

32:33.786 --> 32:36.453
She's a surgical coach.

32:37.364 --> 32:39.998
Wait.
You guys need a coach?

32:41.685 --> 32:43.335
-(grunts softly)
-Um...

32:45.522 --> 32:47.780
There's no definitive test
for Parkinson's,

32:47.800 --> 32:50.358
but I've ruled out similar
neurological conditions.

32:50.377 --> 32:52.302
And he has all
the cardinal signs.

32:52.529 --> 32:55.046
The tremor isn't pronounced yet,
but it's appreciable.

32:55.199 --> 32:56.531
Okay, so what's the next step?

32:56.624 --> 32:58.049
I'd like to start him
on levodopa,

32:58.202 --> 33:00.051
which should improve
his symptoms in a few weeks.

33:00.204 --> 33:02.704
Okay, well, that might
make it easier for his wife

33:02.723 --> 33:04.372
-to take care of him.
-Mm-hmm.

33:04.466 --> 33:07.467
Just got the results back
from Celeste's EKG and echo.

33:07.561 --> 33:11.046
She has stress cardiomyopathy.
Broken heart syndrome.

33:11.064 --> 33:12.214
Oh, my God.

33:12.232 --> 33:13.991
BILLIE:
I remember that from med school.

33:14.142 --> 33:15.066
I always thought
it sounded made up.

33:15.160 --> 33:16.901
Unfortunately, it's very real.

33:16.996 --> 33:19.979
It's when the body faces extreme
physical and emotional stress.

33:19.999 --> 33:24.501
Like in the form of an ailing
and intensely difficult husband.

33:24.652 --> 33:28.255
Taking care of her husband
is literally killing Celeste.

33:34.588 --> 33:36.421
I know you don't complain,

33:36.573 --> 33:37.514
but handling
your husband's health

33:37.665 --> 33:40.242
is taking a physical toll
on you.

33:40.335 --> 33:42.335
We've started you on meds
to manage your heart failure,

33:42.429 --> 33:46.023
but the only cure
is to relieve you

33:46.250 --> 33:47.340
of the underlying stressor.

33:47.434 --> 33:49.251
Now, hold on.
You don't mean that...

33:49.344 --> 33:51.677
George, we think the best option
is to get you

33:51.772 --> 33:54.105
into a skilled nursing facility.

33:54.199 --> 33:56.258
Um, physical therapists
will work with you

33:56.351 --> 33:57.350
to regain your strength

33:57.444 --> 33:59.261
and Celeste can
recuperate at home.

33:59.354 --> 34:00.520
It's not a permanent solution,

34:00.614 --> 34:02.522
but it is the best plan
we have for now.

34:02.616 --> 34:05.208
Are you kidding?
That's a terrible plan.

34:05.435 --> 34:07.419
Celeste and I are a team.

34:08.288 --> 34:10.063
All we need is each other

34:10.065 --> 34:12.198
and our comfy chair at home,
right, honey?

34:12.217 --> 34:14.718
Tell them that's what's best
for both of us.

34:20.041 --> 34:21.558
It's not.

34:23.470 --> 34:26.379
You're going to go
to a nursing facility, George,

34:26.398 --> 34:29.307
and I'm gonna sit
in the comfy chair at home.

34:29.459 --> 34:31.717
And if you love me at all...

34:31.812 --> 34:33.236
Well, of course
I love you, but...

34:33.388 --> 34:34.696
Well, then it's time
you listened.

34:36.300 --> 34:39.651
I used to have a voice, George.

34:39.803 --> 34:42.245
I miss that.

34:42.397 --> 34:45.248
All you need is somebody
to take care of you.

34:46.143 --> 34:47.992
Is that what you think?

34:48.145 --> 34:51.146
Honey, I-I want you safe.

34:51.164 --> 34:53.090
I hate that...

34:54.334 --> 34:57.910
I hate that you're sick
because of me. I...

34:57.930 --> 35:01.181
I just can't imagine living
without you. I can't do it.

35:03.009 --> 35:05.751
Yes, you can.

35:05.771 --> 35:07.996
We'll adapt.

35:08.089 --> 35:10.348
We've done it before.

35:10.442 --> 35:13.351
(chuckles) Remember that time
we lost our first nest egg

35:13.445 --> 35:16.187
to bail out a hundred students
in Wisconsin

35:16.281 --> 35:18.264
when the war started?

35:18.358 --> 35:20.675
Which war?
There have been so many.

35:20.694 --> 35:22.694
(chuckles)

35:22.788 --> 35:24.538
Oh, I love you, George.

35:26.125 --> 35:28.683
It'll always be us against
the world, I promise.

35:28.702 --> 35:30.293
It's just...

35:30.445 --> 35:31.444
(exhales)

35:31.463 --> 35:33.964
...you need to let me
get better.

35:35.801 --> 35:39.469
The truth is, you have always
been the secret to our success.

35:39.696 --> 35:43.047
A heart big enough
for both of us together.

35:43.142 --> 35:46.393
I've known that for 40 years.

35:57.397 --> 36:00.064
The way she looks at us--
like my mother

36:00.217 --> 36:03.493
when I spill juice
on her favorite sofa cushion.

36:03.645 --> 36:05.069
Still on DeSoto, I see.

36:05.164 --> 36:06.646
Don't drink the Kool-Aid, Bell.

36:06.665 --> 36:08.072
We are the O.G. kings,

36:08.167 --> 36:11.168
This newfangled coaching thing
is just a fad.

36:11.395 --> 36:12.394
Careful, you're starting
to sound like my father

36:12.487 --> 36:14.171
talking about
cordless telephones.

36:14.398 --> 36:18.008
She can blow her hurricane
my way, but I will not bend.

36:18.159 --> 36:20.343
And neither should you.

36:20.495 --> 36:21.595
Stay strong, Bell.

36:22.664 --> 36:24.598

36:36.420 --> 36:38.528

Heart rate is on the rise.
He's going into shock.

37:00.277 --> 37:01.125
BELL:
Yeah, the bowel
is going ischemic.

37:01.278 --> 37:03.111
Strangulation due
to the diaphragm.

37:03.129 --> 37:03.795
CHU:
Pressure's still falling,

37:03.889 --> 37:05.296
despite IV pressors.

37:05.390 --> 37:07.373
-Pulse up to 130.
-BELL: These adhesions
are so severe,

37:07.467 --> 37:09.392
it's compromising
blood supply to the bowel.

37:09.544 --> 37:11.394
AUSTIN:
It's time to extend
the diaphragmatic defect.

37:11.546 --> 37:13.980

Yeah, I just, I can't
seem to get the angle.

Oh, yeah.

I can't believe we got George

38:24.619 --> 38:26.469
-to agree to go a nursing home.
-Eh, that was all Celeste.

38:26.696 --> 38:27.862
You guys can declare victory
if you want. I'm staying angry.

38:27.955 --> 38:29.455
Medicare will only pay
for the first 100 days.

38:29.549 --> 38:32.534
After that, there's no good
answer for a couple like them.

38:32.627 --> 38:34.477
-I hate it.
-You're speaking our language,
Winston.

38:34.704 --> 38:36.646
-We love people like you.
-Even if you manipulate me

38:36.873 --> 38:38.556
into breaking the rules.

38:38.650 --> 38:41.709
Hey, I've been trying to get him
to do that for years.

38:41.728 --> 38:43.211
Keep trying.

38:43.229 --> 38:45.063
You know, I've been thinking.

38:45.157 --> 38:46.972
When George's symptoms progress,

38:46.992 --> 38:48.566
we should enroll him
in a clinical trial.

38:48.660 --> 38:50.309
There's new drugs.

38:50.329 --> 38:51.719
You know, I was reading
about one in Baltimore

38:51.888 --> 38:53.721
that's investigating biomarkers
into basically how...

38:53.856 --> 38:55.073
Eh, hold-hold up.

38:55.167 --> 38:56.333
You follow clinical trials

38:56.560 --> 38:58.335
the way most people
play fantasy football.

38:58.486 --> 39:00.170
-(laughs)
-Tell me why you aren't
a scientist yet.

39:00.321 --> 39:02.672
This is obviously your future.
You just got to go for it.

39:02.824 --> 39:05.066
I don't know,
I just feel like it's too late.

39:05.085 --> 39:06.492
If there's one thing
we have learned today,

39:06.586 --> 39:09.471
it's that it's never
too late to change.

39:11.741 --> 39:12.682
BELL:
Not bad, right?

39:12.834 --> 39:14.017
Think so.

-Uh-oh.
-Doctor.

39:16.188 --> 39:17.687
The surgery went well today.

39:17.839 --> 39:21.416
Uh, a thank you is forthcoming,
but I'm still working on it.

39:21.434 --> 39:23.026
Uh, your advice
was extremely helpful.

39:23.177 --> 39:24.361
AUSTIN:
Uh, "extremely"

39:24.512 --> 39:26.421
is gilding the lily a bit,
but we are grateful.

39:26.439 --> 39:28.013
And humbled.

39:29.259 --> 39:31.776
No, I've cleaned my plate,
believe me.

39:31.870 --> 39:33.185
Well, thanks.

39:33.354 --> 39:36.264
I know I said you'd both need
two weeks of coaching,

39:36.282 --> 39:38.208
but I think you're good to go
from here on in.

39:40.361 --> 39:42.604
Okay, well, that's good news.

39:42.622 --> 39:43.713
Indeed.

39:43.865 --> 39:45.882
All right, well, good night.

39:46.109 --> 39:47.258
-Good night.
-Good night.

39:50.371 --> 39:51.888
AUSTIN:
Uh, hey, hey, wait.

39:52.115 --> 39:53.965
Was there something else?

39:54.059 --> 39:56.784
It's just that you shut it down
so quickly.

39:56.803 --> 39:59.712
You know, uh, I'm still proud.

39:59.731 --> 40:02.899
Right?
I-I'm full of hubris.

40:03.050 --> 40:04.308
And that could...

40:04.461 --> 40:07.145
that could stand in the way
of my progress, right?

40:07.297 --> 40:09.555
It could block my ascent
to the Mount Olympus

40:09.574 --> 40:12.150
of surgical greatness,
which is, as everybody knows,

40:12.244 --> 40:13.410
where I belong.

40:13.637 --> 40:15.653
You haven't even judged
my VATS technique yet.

40:15.805 --> 40:18.156
You've been enjoying this.

40:18.308 --> 40:20.083
No, absolutely not.

40:20.234 --> 40:22.234
The adrenaline you get
from learning new skills,

40:22.254 --> 40:23.953
constantly improving.

40:24.105 --> 40:25.422
You were missing that
in your life.

40:25.573 --> 40:28.332
Now that you've tasted it,
you want more.

40:28.485 --> 40:30.985
Knowledge is exhilarating.

40:31.078 --> 40:34.347
A, uh, pleasure stimulant.

40:35.341 --> 40:37.642
10:00 a.m. tomorrow,
your office.

40:46.761 --> 40:48.486
Okay, I know this is a big ask,

40:48.596 --> 40:50.613
but I would like to start
shifting my professional focus

40:50.765 --> 40:52.006
to clinical trials.

40:52.099 --> 40:53.950
I would need to go part-time
in the ER

40:54.101 --> 40:55.285
and you would need
to find a new ER doctor,

40:55.512 --> 40:57.269
but think of all the worthy
people we could help.

40:57.289 --> 40:58.179
Like my patient today.

40:58.198 --> 41:00.290
Not to mention the money

41:00.441 --> 41:03.293
and the prestige
that it would bring Chastain.

41:04.020 --> 41:05.277
What do you think?

41:05.446 --> 41:08.614
I think you should stop putting
Red Bull in your coffee.

41:08.633 --> 41:10.300
(laughs)

41:10.451 --> 41:13.544
But I also think
it's a wonderful idea.

41:13.638 --> 41:15.287
You do?

41:15.381 --> 41:16.556
I do.

41:17.642 --> 41:19.701
Have a proposal
on my desk by Monday.

41:19.794 --> 41:21.978
(chuckles)

41:24.224 --> 41:27.391
-CONRAD: Ah, hey, Bubble.
-Dad!

41:27.486 --> 41:29.377
(grunts)

41:29.395 --> 41:31.729
-Good day at school?
-Billie told Luca

41:31.881 --> 41:33.531
to stop talking.

41:34.493 --> 41:36.050
Kid wouldn't shut up
about dinosaurs.

41:36.069 --> 41:37.218
It was time to go.

41:37.237 --> 41:38.328
(laughs)

41:38.555 --> 41:42.056
Good, I'm glad I caught you guys
before you left.

41:42.075 --> 41:43.500
Hey, Gigi.

41:43.727 --> 41:44.742
-This is for you.
-(gasps)

41:44.894 --> 41:47.245
My own stethoscope.
Awesome!

41:47.397 --> 41:49.397
MARION:
Since you had so much fun
at the hospital today,

41:49.490 --> 41:51.733
I thought you could practice
your nursing skills at home.

41:51.826 --> 41:53.084
Uh, that's really sweet,
thank you.

41:53.327 --> 41:56.161
Yeah, she told me she wants
to be a nurse when she grows up.

41:56.181 --> 41:58.330
Oh. She's getting
more practical.

41:58.350 --> 42:00.332
Uh, last week,
it was a firefighter farmer.

42:00.352 --> 42:02.927
The week before,
it was a professional octopus.

42:03.021 --> 42:04.187
MARION:
I'm sure she'll go through
a few more jobs

42:04.414 --> 42:07.190
before she finds the right one.
(chuckles)

42:07.341 --> 42:10.935
All right,
I will see you guys later.

42:11.029 --> 42:12.612
See you.

42:16.517 --> 42:18.993
Hey...

42:20.597 --> 42:22.497
...what you said earlier.

42:24.617 --> 42:25.708

42:28.271 --> 42:29.287
