00:01.418 --> 00:04.630
<i>It seems today that all you see</i>

00:04.713 --> 00:08.008
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

00:08.217 --> 00:11.637
<i>But where are those</i>
<i>good old-fashioned values</i>

00:11.845 --> 00:14.264
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

00:14.848 --> 00:17.559
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

00:18.185 --> 00:21.438
<i>Lucky there's a man who</i>
<i>positively can do</i>

00:21.605 --> 00:23.106
<i>All the things that make us</i>

00:23.273 --> 00:24.650
<i>Laugh and cry</i>

00:24.858 --> 00:30.072
<i>He's a family guy</i>

00:35.160 --> 00:37.412
<i>We now return to</i> The Terminator.

00:39.414 --> 00:41.375
<i>I've been sent here from the future.</i>

00:41.458 --> 00:44.586
<i>I've to have sex with your housekeeper</i>
<i>to save humanity.</i>

00:44.670 --> 00:46.588
<i>- What?</i>
<i>- Bring me your housekeeper.</i>

00:46.672 --> 00:49.675
<i>I've to have sex with her now.</i>
<i>I'm the Terminator.</i>

00:49.758 --> 00:50.968
<i>I don't have a housekeeper,</i>

00:51.051 --> 00:53.846
<i>and I think you're just</i>
<i>present-day Arnold Schwarzenegger.</i>

00:53.929 --> 00:55.472
<i>No, I'm a machine.</i>

00:55.556 --> 00:58.475
<i>Every second I'm not having sex</i>
<i>with a housekeeper,</i>

00:58.559 --> 01:01.103
<i>robots are killing people in the future.</i>

01:01.186 --> 01:03.146
<i>Okay, I finish for the day.</i>

01:03.230 --> 01:06.024
<i>You lied to me. You do have a housekeeper.</i>

01:06.108 --> 01:08.360
<i>Let's go make a large-faced boy.</i>

01:11.029 --> 01:12.489
Whoa, whoa, whoa, cop, cop, cop.

01:12.698 --> 01:13.699
Peter, it's me,

01:13.782 --> 01:15.701
and you're an adult man drinkin' in a bar.

01:15.784 --> 01:16.994
Anyway, sorry I'm late.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.413
The pantry down at the station
needed new shelf paper.

01:19.496 --> 01:21.081
That's what they got you doin' down there?

01:21.164 --> 01:23.584
Well, that and I'm also in charge
of the office gerbil.

01:23.667 --> 01:26.628
And let me tell you,
Lieutenant Nibbles is quite a handful.

01:26.712 --> 01:29.006
He'll only eat real cheese, not processed.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.300
You buy special cheese for a gerbil?

01:31.383 --> 01:32.885
Yeah, I have to. He outranks me.

01:33.177 --> 01:34.803
Jeez, Joe, what the hell happened?

01:34.887 --> 01:37.389
You used to be this badass cop
out there on the street,

01:37.472 --> 01:39.057
bustin' heads and keepin' us safe.

01:39.224 --> 01:42.352
Well, it may not sound exciting,
but I play an important role.

01:42.436 --> 01:44.188
I go through all the body cam footage

01:44.271 --> 01:46.481
and take out all the parts
where the cops go pee-pee.

01:46.732 --> 01:49.443
So, you're just erasin'
cop wieners all day?

01:49.651 --> 01:51.695
Eh, not erasing,
sort of cuttin' them together

01:51.778 --> 01:53.989
into a funny montage
we show on birthdays.

01:54.072 --> 01:55.073
Speakin' of which,

01:55.157 --> 01:57.451
Flannigan's got the big four-oh
comin' up. Gotta go.

01:58.827 --> 02:01.705
Man, you guys think Joe's
as happy as he says he is

02:01.788 --> 02:03.373
just doin' all that desk work?

02:03.457 --> 02:05.792
No way. He's just puttin'
lipstick on a pig.

02:06.418 --> 02:09.254
This is called Crimson Sky.
What do you think?

02:09.379 --> 02:10.380
Hmm.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.382
- Harold?
- Get this off of me!

02:12.674 --> 02:14.510
What are you doing
in the women's department?

02:14.676 --> 02:16.094
Eh... Waiting for you.

02:16.178 --> 02:17.763
Well, I'm ready. Let's go.

02:20.265 --> 02:22.059
Who are you?

02:28.065 --> 02:30.901
Ugh, she just put her tampons
on top of the bread.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.070
Take the groceries out.
We gotta start over.

02:33.320 --> 02:36.448
Mom, can I go bare-hand raisins
from the bulk aisle?

02:36.532 --> 02:40.244
Okay, but if you get caught, just say,
"Oopsie-poopsie" like a simpleton.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.746
Hey, watch your fat arms.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.039
Excuse me, ma'am,

02:44.122 --> 02:45.624
your little girl dropped her teddy bear.

02:45.707 --> 02:48.043
What? Little girl?

02:48.168 --> 02:51.046
Yeah, she hates it
when she drops that.

02:51.129 --> 02:53.841
He's actually a little boy
but thank you very much.

02:54.174 --> 02:57.177
Did she just think I was a girl?
Why would she think that?

02:57.261 --> 02:58.720
I don't know.
Maybe she saw you try to throw

02:58.804 --> 03:00.472
that feather in the yard yesterday.

03:00.556 --> 03:02.724
Hey, don't watch me when I'm doin' stuff.

03:03.058 --> 03:05.310
What are you doing, kid?
Those aren't free.

03:05.394 --> 03:07.354
Oopsie-poopsie!

03:07.437 --> 03:09.857
Oh, God bless you.
Help yourself.

03:21.118 --> 03:23.287
- Car trouble?
- Ah! Son of a bitch, Joe,

03:23.370 --> 03:24.371
didn't even hear you comin'.

03:24.454 --> 03:26.373
Yeah, I'm kind of quiet on grass.

03:30.085 --> 03:31.545
Thanks for givin' me a ride, Joe.

03:31.628 --> 03:33.046
Hey, since we're in a cop car,

03:33.130 --> 03:35.883
let's talk about our hunches
and how somethin' doesn't add up.

03:35.966 --> 03:36.967
All right.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.386
I have a hunch Madea's not really a girl.

03:39.469 --> 03:41.805
Yeah, somethin' doesn't add up about that.

03:41.889 --> 03:43.599
<i>All units, report to a drug deal</i>

03:43.682 --> 03:45.184
<i>in progress at Fifth and Maple.</i>

03:45.267 --> 03:47.603
<i>Shots fired. Suspect possibly armed.</i>

03:48.061 --> 03:50.898
<i>Well, shots fired, </i>
<i>so definitely armed. Duh!</i>

03:51.023 --> 03:53.108
- <i>Dispatch much?</i>
- <i>Sorry, guys.</i>

03:53.734 --> 03:56.153
Fifth and Maple?
That's right near here. We gotta go.

03:56.236 --> 03:59.823
No can do. I gotta go to the station
and tidy up the bulletin board.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.867
No one's bitin' on those guitar lessons.

04:01.950 --> 04:04.161
What are you talkin' about?
There's a drug deal goin' down.

04:04.244 --> 04:07.080
Peter, there's a lot you don't
understand about police work.

04:07.164 --> 04:09.041
What's to understand? I watch TV.

04:09.124 --> 04:10.876
Come on, Joe. Let's put this '70s siren

04:10.959 --> 04:12.085
on your car and go.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.339
Did you just wipe a booger on my roof?

04:15.422 --> 04:16.507
Let's go! Let's go!

04:20.052 --> 04:22.095
- Oh, crap! Cops!

04:22.596 --> 04:23.597
That's the house.

04:25.057 --> 04:27.893
Hold on, Peter. We can't go in there.
We gotta wait for backup.

04:28.101 --> 04:29.394
The hell we do.

04:29.895 --> 04:30.896
Peter!

04:31.104 --> 04:32.773
Reach for the stars.

04:33.023 --> 04:34.024
What?

04:34.107 --> 04:36.360
I think he's telling us
to follow our dreams.

04:36.568 --> 04:38.362
- Where are the drugs?
- What are you doin'?

04:38.445 --> 04:40.781
You're violatin' all kinds of procedures.

04:40.864 --> 04:42.407
There's no drugs here, pig.

04:45.452 --> 04:48.455
A-ha! No drugs, huh?
What do you call this?

04:48.580 --> 04:50.290
And I bet there's more
where that came from?

04:50.374 --> 04:52.793
- They're tryin' to flush their stash.

04:54.336 --> 04:55.712
Nice try, scumbag,

04:55.796 --> 04:58.090
but I got your squishy drugs right here.

04:58.173 --> 04:59.258
Oh-oh!

04:59.341 --> 05:01.009
Peter, hand me my gun and get out of here.

05:01.093 --> 05:02.594
I could get fired for this.

05:02.761 --> 05:06.014
And I can't go back to my job
as a magician's assistant.

05:08.517 --> 05:11.645
And now to pull the two sides apart.

05:12.479 --> 05:15.649
- And wiggle your toes.

05:16.650 --> 05:19.278
I said wiggle your toes.

05:19.444 --> 05:22.865
Yeah, that's why I wanted
to talk to you before the show.

05:29.079 --> 05:31.415
- What's up, dudes?
- Stewie, what the hell is all this?

05:31.498 --> 05:33.876
Oh, only the most manly thing ever.

05:34.001 --> 05:36.837
A little somethin' called
American football.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.922
Is that a Michael Sam jersey?

05:39.006 --> 05:41.717
Yep, two boy names. Doubly masculine.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.510
- Like, George Michael?
- Shut up!

05:43.594 --> 05:45.554
Come on, Stewie.
You still hung up about the woman

05:45.637 --> 05:47.306
at the grocery store
thinkin' you were a girl?

05:47.389 --> 05:49.558
Elton John is another.

05:49.641 --> 05:51.393
It has nothing to do with that, Brian.

05:51.476 --> 05:53.854
I just thought it'd be good
to take up a sport.

05:53.937 --> 05:55.105
You know, like boys do.

05:55.189 --> 05:57.399
You don't have to play football
to prove you're a boy.

05:57.482 --> 06:00.611
Barney Frank is yet another one.

06:00.694 --> 06:01.695
Chris, please.

06:01.778 --> 06:02.905
Actually, you know what? Ricky Martin.

06:02.988 --> 06:03.989
There's a bunch of these.

06:04.072 --> 06:05.782
Anyway, they're not gonna let
you play football, Stewie.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.618
- You're too little.
- Oh, don't worry.

06:07.701 --> 06:10.037
I'm gonna be bad news for the other team.

06:10.120 --> 06:12.164
And nobody likes bad news.

06:12.247 --> 06:14.750
Except for Larry the Self-Loathing Idiot.

06:15.209 --> 06:18.504
Larry, I'm afraid you only have
three months to live.

06:25.844 --> 06:28.805
Swanson! I need to see you right now.

06:32.017 --> 06:33.727
Captain. Lieutenant.

06:34.186 --> 06:37.523
You had no business participating
in that raid at Fifth and Maple.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.233
I know that, Captain. I'm sorry that I...

06:39.316 --> 06:40.901
But I'm glad you did.

06:40.984 --> 06:41.985
Excuse me?

06:42.069 --> 06:44.696
You brought down one of the biggest
drug rings in Quahog.

06:44.780 --> 06:46.573
Above and beyond, Swanson.

06:47.074 --> 06:49.993
Well, sir, I'm just like any other cop.

06:50.077 --> 06:52.454
My wife puts on my pants
one leg at a time.

06:52.704 --> 06:54.915
I appreciate your modesty, but nice work.

06:55.249 --> 06:57.209
It's hard to believe
you did that all by yourself.

06:57.709 --> 07:00.003
Yep, did it all by myself, I did.

07:00.087 --> 07:03.173
I did. My little lonesome, says I.

07:03.590 --> 07:05.884
That's weird phrasing,
but I'll tell you this, Swanson,

07:05.968 --> 07:07.261
you keep up this kind of work,

07:07.344 --> 07:09.263
there'll be no more grocery runs for you.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.265
You'll be back on the street full time.

07:11.348 --> 07:12.391
Thank you, Captain.

07:13.684 --> 07:14.935
- Sir.

07:15.227 --> 07:16.270
Thank you, sir.

07:25.070 --> 07:26.947
Hey, Peter. You know,
I was just thinkin' about

07:27.030 --> 07:28.866
how much fun we had the other day

07:28.949 --> 07:32.411
and wondered if you'd wanna join me
for another ride along.

07:32.619 --> 07:34.621
Well, yeah, but I thought
you said I couldn't do that

07:34.705 --> 07:35.706
'cause you'd get in trouble.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.082
It'll be our little secret.

07:37.332 --> 07:39.418
All right. Hey, can I drive the car?

07:39.501 --> 07:40.919
Yeah, I guess I can let you drive.

07:41.003 --> 07:43.755
Awesome! Hey, and can we go slow
up to a homeless guy

07:43.839 --> 07:45.799
and go, "Yip, yip" and see what he does?

07:45.883 --> 07:46.925
That's half the job!

07:47.009 --> 07:48.427
So what do you say?
You think you're up to it?

07:48.510 --> 07:51.180
You bet I am.
I'm in the best shape of my life.

07:51.430 --> 07:53.765
I've been workin'
my Dave Matthews punchin' bag.

07:54.183 --> 07:56.185
Thank you very much for using me today.

07:59.021 --> 08:01.982
This isn't annoying enough.
I need my David Lee Roth bag.

08:11.992 --> 08:15.245
Wow! So these are
the wife beaters of tomorrow.

08:15.329 --> 08:16.997
Which team is Stewie gonna to be on?

08:17.080 --> 08:18.373
He's not gonna be on any team.

08:18.457 --> 08:21.001
He's just overcompensating
because he was called a girl.

08:21.293 --> 08:23.795
But once he sees how big
the other kids are, he'll back out.

08:24.630 --> 08:26.924
Ooh, my shoes have 12 little heels.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.008
They're cleats.

08:28.300 --> 08:30.427
Okay, kids, let's start practice.

08:30.594 --> 08:32.429
Yeah, football. Boy stuff.

08:32.513 --> 08:34.389
Hittin' the shower. Gettin' embarrassed.

08:34.473 --> 08:35.641
Goin' home to shower.

08:35.891 --> 08:38.685
Okay, Stewie, enough is enough.
All right, let's get you out of here.

08:38.936 --> 08:40.646
Yeah, you probably
should get him out of there

08:40.729 --> 08:42.189
'cause he's just a little shrimp.

08:42.397 --> 08:43.982
Um, okay, thank you.

08:44.066 --> 08:46.860
I mean, look at him.
My Tyler would kill him out there.

08:47.027 --> 08:49.404
Okay, well, believe me,
there's more to him than you think.

08:49.488 --> 08:52.115
- Come on, Stewie.
- You know, ballet is great exercise.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.243
Maybe you should put
short stack in a tutu.

08:54.785 --> 08:57.371
No, you know what, Stewie?
Get the hell out on that field.

08:57.704 --> 08:59.665
And if you see that Tyler,
take his knee out.

08:59.748 --> 09:01.708
All right, let's do it. Football game.

09:01.792 --> 09:03.627
Then reminder, showering at home.

09:04.711 --> 09:07.631
Okay, I guess we'll see
who's got the toughest kid here.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.049
Yeah, I guess we will.

09:11.426 --> 09:14.012
- Hey!
- Oopsie-poopsie.

09:14.513 --> 09:15.514

10:06.648 --> 10:09.193
<i>Another plane, another train</i>
<i>another bottle in the brain</i>

10:09.276 --> 10:11.945
<i>Another girl, another fight</i>
<i>another drive all night</i>

10:12.196 --> 10:14.489
<i>Our manager's crazy</i>
<i>he always smokes dust</i>

10:14.573 --> 10:17.034
<i>He's got his own room</i>
<i>at the back of the bus</i>

10:17.284 --> 10:19.536
<i>- Tour around the world</i>
<i>- You rock around the clock</i>

10:19.620 --> 10:21.788
<i>Plane to hotel, girls on the jock</i>

10:21.997 --> 10:24.208
<i>We're thrashin' hotels</i>
<i>like it's goin' out of style</i>

10:28.462 --> 10:31.089
<i>Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.</i>
<i>Our top story tonight,</i>

10:31.173 --> 10:33.884
<i>local news anchor,</i>
<i>too professional to laugh at penis</i>

10:33.967 --> 10:35.594
<i>poked through hole in cue card.</i>

10:35.677 --> 10:38.096
<i>But first, earlier today at City Hall,</i>

10:38.180 --> 10:39.932
<i>the mayor honored a hero cop</i>

10:40.015 --> 10:42.142
<i>who has foiled a string of recent crimes.</i>

10:42.392 --> 10:45.479
<i>Good afternoon.</i>
<i>We had a budget meeting that ran long,</i>

10:45.562 --> 10:49.316
<i>so I'm gonna eat my lunch</i>
<i>while I hold this press conference.</i>

10:50.609 --> 10:54.821
<i>Oh, my favorite.</i>
<i>Loose cop salad in a lunch box.</i>

10:55.864 --> 10:59.368
<i>I'm gonna now shake this up</i>
<i>like a lady in your office.</i>

11:01.119 --> 11:03.747
<i>Okay, while the dressing does its magic,</i>

11:03.830 --> 11:06.124
<i>let's honor Officer Joe Swanson,</i>

11:06.208 --> 11:10.671
<i>who single-handedly cut crime</i>
<i>in Quahog by 75%.</i>

11:12.297 --> 11:14.466
What? Single-handedly?

11:14.633 --> 11:18.095
<i>Officer Swanson,</i>
<i>as thanks from a grateful city,</i>

11:18.178 --> 11:20.597
<i>please accept this certificate of merit.</i>

11:20.681 --> 11:24.810
<i>And with that, I hereby declare</i>
<i>this hero cop open.</i>

11:25.853 --> 11:28.647
<i>Whoa, sweet bod. You lift, bro?</i>

11:29.189 --> 11:31.608
Damn it, I can't believe
Joe's hoggin' all the credit.

11:31.692 --> 11:34.278
That bastard's just gettin' famous
by trickin' people.

11:34.528 --> 11:35.737
Like Orson Welles.

11:36.196 --> 11:41.118
So, the aliens have come to Earth
to destroy all mankind.

11:42.035 --> 11:45.747
And they're going to start at McDonald's.

11:45.831 --> 11:48.208
So, if you're in line there,
you better run!

11:49.459 --> 11:51.503
Whoa, whoa, not the workers though.

11:51.587 --> 11:53.714
They've already said the workers are safe.

11:57.885 --> 12:00.137
Excuse me, Coach Hara... Harar...

12:00.220 --> 12:01.889
Harar... Rarara...

12:01.972 --> 12:03.974
- It's Herrera.
- Okay, that's a lot of R's,

12:04.057 --> 12:06.602
but listen, I noticed
you're not starting Stewie.

12:06.685 --> 12:07.978
No, I can't put him in.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.646
I mean, he can come out
for limp handshakes

12:09.730 --> 12:11.315
at the end of the game,
but I can't play him.

12:11.398 --> 12:12.900
- He's too little.
- Little?

12:13.150 --> 12:14.693
Oh, like that car you drive over there.

12:14.776 --> 12:17.154
Let's see if it looks bigger
when I throw a Sprite at it.

12:19.573 --> 12:21.867
Well, it's not my car, but I don't care.

12:21.950 --> 12:23.243
I'm just a volunteer.

12:23.577 --> 12:24.953
All right, Griffin, get in there.

12:28.999 --> 12:31.418
Come on, Stewie, give your dog
somethin' to post on Facebook.

12:31.960 --> 12:33.587
Somethin' to post on Facebook. Let's go.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.842
All right! And nobody's blocking...

12:40.594 --> 12:42.554
- Oh, my God, Stewie!

12:44.056 --> 12:45.057
Are you okay?

12:45.265 --> 12:46.934
Back off! He may have a concussion.

12:47.017 --> 12:48.018
A concussion?

12:48.101 --> 12:52.648
You do me an honor, lieutenant,
but my dance card is full.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.072
Officer Swanson, as requested,

13:00.155 --> 13:02.324
here's a big stack of the
cases you cracked.

13:02.407 --> 13:05.786
Oh, great. Now I'm gonna go ahead
and brood over a photo of the girl

13:05.869 --> 13:08.038
whose case was the one I couldn't solve.

13:08.997 --> 13:13.293
Your '70s sweater and feathered hair
let people know this is a cold case.

13:14.253 --> 13:17.130
Well, hello, Officer Swanson.

13:17.798 --> 13:20.467
Peter, what are you doin'?
You're not supposed to be here.

13:20.551 --> 13:21.885
I saw you on TV,

13:21.969 --> 13:24.054
hoggin' all the credit for my police work.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.974
Look, I told you I need you
to be a silent partner on this.

13:27.057 --> 13:29.059
The truth is,
I could get into a lot of trouble.

13:29.309 --> 13:32.563
Oh, I see. You need me to be
the bad cop who kicks all the ass,

13:32.646 --> 13:34.398
and then I'm supposed to be
quiet about it?

13:34.481 --> 13:36.483
Well, my silence is gonna cost you.

13:36.567 --> 13:37.568
What are you sayin'?

13:37.651 --> 13:40.070
I'm sayin' you get stuff, I want stuff.

13:40.153 --> 13:43.407
I've seen that evidence locker.
I know you've got Discmans in there.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.492
I want a murdered jogger's Discman.

13:45.576 --> 13:47.119
Peter, you know I can't do that.

13:47.202 --> 13:49.788
Yeah, well, maybe I accidentally reveal

13:49.872 --> 13:51.999
that you're not the hero
everyone thinks you are

13:52.082 --> 13:54.585
and that you've been lettin' your neighbor
do all kinds of cop stuff.

13:54.668 --> 13:56.587
You wouldn't do that, would you?

13:56.670 --> 13:59.006
You bet I would. And one more thing.

14:00.507 --> 14:03.594
Peter asked me to do this.
He said it's somethin' from before.

14:03.677 --> 14:05.345
I don't know. I hope it's funny.

14:13.520 --> 14:16.523
All right, I'm here,
but why did you want me to bring this?

14:16.607 --> 14:17.608
I'll tell you why.

14:17.691 --> 14:19.610
You're gettin' all the credit
for my police work,

14:19.693 --> 14:21.195
so I want stuff from you.

14:21.278 --> 14:23.780
I want a minute in your house
with this shopping cart

14:23.864 --> 14:26.241
like <i>Supermarket Sweep.</i> Here, time me.

14:26.325 --> 14:28.952
Peter, you expect me
to let you ransack my house?

14:29.036 --> 14:31.580
Well, unless you'd rather
I spill the beans to the chief

14:31.663 --> 14:33.290
about who's been doin' your dirty work.

14:34.166 --> 14:35.375
Okay, go.

14:38.045 --> 14:39.796
Ah! Sweet, board games.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.673
I'm takin' the cannon from your <i>Monopoly.</i>

14:41.757 --> 14:43.842
Why is Peter in the house?

14:43.926 --> 14:45.761
It's a police matter, Bonnie.

14:46.345 --> 14:48.096
Hey, how come
Kevin's room is locked?

14:48.180 --> 14:49.806
He just wants some privacy.

14:49.890 --> 14:51.433
It's locked from the outside.

14:51.517 --> 14:53.310
Don't open it, Peter.

14:55.229 --> 14:57.147
Hi, baby. Hi, baby.

14:57.231 --> 14:58.690
Get out of Susie's room!

15:00.901 --> 15:03.028
Your stuff sucks.
I didn't need the full minute.

15:08.242 --> 15:11.203
Hey, Stewie,
how's our little concussion guy?

15:14.164 --> 15:16.625
Oh, my God. Can you... Can you see me?

15:16.708 --> 15:18.836
Yeah. No, I'm fine, I'm fine.

15:18.919 --> 15:21.296
Is... Is anybody gonna
answer that telephone?

15:21.380 --> 15:23.715
He keeps thinking
the phone is ringing, Brian.

15:23.799 --> 15:25.217
Well, at least he's talking again.

15:25.300 --> 15:26.635
I think that means he's getting better.

15:26.718 --> 15:28.345
Is it day or night?

15:28.428 --> 15:30.430
I don't... I don't care.
I just wanna know.

15:30.514 --> 15:31.932
Lois, answer the bloody phone!

15:32.015 --> 15:33.976
No, no, we don't need Lois.

15:34.059 --> 15:35.394
Chris, pretend to answer the phone.

15:35.519 --> 15:39.773
Hello. Okay. Yes, one second.

15:39.857 --> 15:41.441
Mom, it's for you.

15:41.525 --> 15:42.985
What? No, damn it, Chris.

15:43.068 --> 15:46.655
I'll... I'll take that.
Hello, this is Brian Griffin.

15:46.947 --> 15:49.324
Actually, I already receive
<i>The New York Times,</i>

15:49.408 --> 15:52.661
and I always enjoy finishing
the crossword puzzle.

15:52.744 --> 15:54.454
You're bragging to nobody?

15:54.538 --> 15:55.664
Phone's still ringin'.

15:55.747 --> 15:57.791
Crap, Chris,
he's worse off than I thought.

15:57.875 --> 15:58.876
We have to do something.

15:58.959 --> 16:01.170
Well, on TV if somebody
gets hit on the head,

16:01.253 --> 16:04.590
you hit him a second time,
and that gets him back to normal.

16:04.673 --> 16:06.425
No, no, Chris, this is very serious.

16:06.508 --> 16:09.219
You see, what a concussion is,
is the impact of brain matter

16:09.303 --> 16:11.013
on the inside of the skull.

16:11.096 --> 16:12.556
That's why you
sometimes hear this nonsense

16:12.639 --> 16:14.516
about, "Oh, let's just give
'em better helmets."

16:14.600 --> 16:16.602
But you can't make a helmet
for the inside...

16:16.685 --> 16:18.770
- Chris, are you crazy?

16:18.854 --> 16:21.148
Shh! Let's just let him sleep this off.

16:22.107 --> 16:23.692
Look how peaceful he is.

16:23.775 --> 16:26.320
I wonder what's goin' on
in that little head of his.

16:29.281 --> 16:32.284
<i>The world</i>
<i>looks mighty good to me</i>

16:32.618 --> 16:35.662
<i>'Cause Tootsie Rolls are all I see</i>

16:35.746 --> 16:38.957
<i>Whatever it is I think I see</i>

16:39.291 --> 16:42.211
<i>Becomes a Tootsie Roll to me</i>

16:47.549 --> 16:49.593
Joe, is something wrong?

16:49.676 --> 16:52.888
I didn't hear you crying
in the shower this morning.

16:52.971 --> 16:54.723
I'm just dealin' with some stuff at work.

16:54.806 --> 16:56.725
But everything is going so well.

16:56.808 --> 16:58.560
You've been getting
all those commendations,

16:58.644 --> 17:00.896
and my online handmade lip balm business

17:00.979 --> 17:02.689
is really taking off.

17:02.773 --> 17:04.233
I don't even know
what you're talkin' about.

17:04.316 --> 17:08.362
Well, I'm proud of you,
and you should be proud of yourself.

17:12.115 --> 17:13.116
I want these.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.661
Rechargeable heated mittens.
Write it down.

17:16.828 --> 17:17.829
Forget it, Peter.

17:17.913 --> 17:19.748
I'm done being blackmailed by you.

17:19.831 --> 17:21.333
Oh, yeah? Well, fine.

17:21.416 --> 17:23.752
But remember,
you're nothin' without your muscle.

17:24.253 --> 17:25.254
<i>Any available unit.</i>

17:25.337 --> 17:27.631
<i>We have a report</i>
<i>of an armed robbery in progress.</i>

17:28.257 --> 17:30.676
Go on, hero cop. You don't need me.

17:31.301 --> 17:36.223
Well, maybe you and I can do
one last bust for old time's sake.

17:36.306 --> 17:37.432
Yes! All right, let's do it.

17:37.516 --> 17:39.726
Let's go be heroes,
like the designated driver.

17:40.853 --> 17:44.273
Is there a skeleton with a wig
that can drive me home?

17:44.565 --> 17:45.607
I can.

17:45.691 --> 17:48.861
Look at this mess.
Where is the housekeeper?

17:55.450 --> 17:58.161
Well, you already look better.
The doctor should be in any minute.

17:59.538 --> 18:01.164
- Chris, what the hell?

18:01.248 --> 18:04.543
There is a room where you can
go in and just get free people.

18:04.626 --> 18:06.003
Yeah, you should give that back.

18:07.421 --> 18:10.299
Look, I'm really sorry
I let you get hurt, Stewie.

18:10.382 --> 18:12.217
I never should have pushed you
into that game.

18:12.467 --> 18:13.719
Well, it's not your fault.

18:14.219 --> 18:16.471
I just have to accept that I'm not a man,

18:16.555 --> 18:17.890
and I'm never going to be one.

18:18.098 --> 18:20.142
That's ridiculous.
You can't let what one woman

18:20.225 --> 18:22.644
says in a grocery store
define who you are.

18:22.728 --> 18:25.898
Mom and Dad said it, too.
I heard it through a vent in the wall.

18:26.565 --> 18:28.025
Hey, knock knock.

18:28.108 --> 18:30.694
Coach Herrera? You came to see Stewie?

18:30.777 --> 18:33.572
Yeah, I wanted to check in
on this tough little guy.

18:33.864 --> 18:35.407
Tough little guy?

18:35.741 --> 18:38.160
It takes a real man to take
a hit like that.

18:38.243 --> 18:39.244
Feel better, sport.

18:40.245 --> 18:41.872
How about that?

18:42.080 --> 18:43.332
Real man.

18:43.415 --> 18:46.418
See, I told you, Stewie.
You're a big, tough boy.

18:46.502 --> 18:48.086
Yes, I guess I am.

18:48.170 --> 18:49.379
That may be, Stewie,

18:49.463 --> 18:51.757
but if I were you, I'd stay off the field.

18:51.840 --> 18:54.760
Concussions are the number one problem
in football today.

18:54.843 --> 18:56.845
Recent brain scan studies have shown...

18:58.680 --> 19:01.350
That brain injuries are directly linked

19:01.433 --> 19:04.478
to dementia and suicides
in former players.

19:04.645 --> 19:06.396
- Yet the league...

19:06.939 --> 19:10.651
You can play the music louder,
but you can't silence the truth.

19:13.820 --> 19:14.988
Peter, slow down.

19:15.072 --> 19:18.617
No can do, Joe. I'm all hopped up
'cause I Vicks Vapo'd my sack.

19:20.827 --> 19:22.621
I also got some of it in my eyes.

19:24.581 --> 19:26.959
Am I getting 'em?
Am I getting the robbers?

19:27.167 --> 19:28.794
Peter, put the gun down.

19:31.129 --> 19:33.632
On the floor, punks. Everybody dies.

19:34.424 --> 19:36.969
My already irritated eyes.

19:41.014 --> 19:42.641
Oh, damn it, Peter.

19:42.850 --> 19:45.102
This is Officer Swanson.
I need backup at...

19:46.270 --> 19:48.021
They're beatin' me with
vapin' accessories.

19:48.105 --> 19:49.606
Forget it. There's no time.

19:52.484 --> 19:53.610
Freeze! Police!

19:53.777 --> 19:56.154
Too late, Joe. I already identify
with my captors.

19:56.238 --> 19:57.656
Don't hurt Max and Ken.

20:18.260 --> 20:20.888
Holy crap, Joe, that was freakin' amazin'.

20:20.971 --> 20:22.181
You kicked their ass.

20:22.264 --> 20:24.224
You're right. I guess I did.

20:24.308 --> 20:27.686
And without my help.
See, this is the Joe I remember.

20:28.228 --> 20:31.023
You know,
maybe you had it in you all along.

20:31.356 --> 20:33.859
Wow. I guess I just got ground down

20:33.942 --> 20:36.612
by years of people
treatin' me like an errand boy,

20:36.695 --> 20:38.947
and I just let 'em walk all over me.

20:39.531 --> 20:41.783
You know, you were a real pain
in the butt as a partner

20:41.867 --> 20:44.036
but you helped me find myself again.

20:44.536 --> 20:46.496
- Thanks, Peter.
- You're welcome, Joe.

20:47.497 --> 20:48.498
Excuse me.

20:48.582 --> 20:51.502
Do you have any TaB soda
I can bring back to the sex dungeon
