WEBVTT

00:03.217 --> 00:06.986
Okay, I'm zeroing out the
electro-osmotic flow rate

00:06.988 --> 00:09.255
in the micro-fluidic channel.

00:09.257 --> 00:11.323
Nicely done, Howard.

00:11.325 --> 00:13.893
Well, my wife is four-foot-ten
and sexually satisfied,

00:13.895 --> 00:16.829
so clearly I know my way
around tiny things.

00:16.831 --> 00:19.798
Good for you, on the cutting
edge of new technology

00:19.800 --> 00:21.634
and still making
inappropriate comments

00:21.636 --> 00:23.969
about the mother of your child.

00:23.971 --> 00:27.773
Those are just the things
I say out loud.

00:27.775 --> 00:29.909
Gentlemen, we need to stop
immediately.

00:29.911 --> 00:30.976
What's wrong?

00:30.978 --> 00:32.110
I'm looking at the math,

00:32.113 --> 00:33.579
and I think we can
make the device

00:33.581 --> 00:36.682
between eight and
ten percent smaller.

00:36.684 --> 00:39.618
That's great, but the
Air Force approved the specs.

00:39.620 --> 00:40.686
We're good to go.

00:40.688 --> 00:42.288
Yeah. It doesn't
need to be smaller.

00:42.290 --> 00:44.056
Shame on you.

00:45.226 --> 00:48.227
Where would we be if poodle
breeders had that attitude?

00:48.229 --> 00:50.095
I'll tell you.

00:50.097 --> 00:52.031
We would have the standard
and the miniature poodle,

00:52.033 --> 00:53.299
but no toy or teacup.

00:53.301 --> 00:54.733
Which by the way,

00:54.735 --> 00:56.902
is not an officially
recognized breed,

00:56.904 --> 00:58.671
but that's just poodle politics.

00:58.673 --> 01:01.573
Can we please stop
talking about poodles?

01:01.575 --> 01:04.108
Fine. Candy bars.

01:04.111 --> 01:06.879
Now, do you enjoy a fun size?
I know you do.

01:06.881 --> 01:09.315
Sheldon, we don't need
to make this smaller.

01:09.317 --> 01:10.983
Your work is done.
Go home.

01:10.985 --> 01:12.851
I don't want to go home.

01:12.853 --> 01:14.320
Fine, go for a little walk.

01:14.322 --> 01:15.487
Then what?

01:15.489 --> 01:17.323
Just keep walking.

01:47.355 --> 01:51.057
At least it's quiet
when he takes bathroom breaks.

01:51.059 --> 01:52.625
I know.

01:52.627 --> 01:56.495
That's why I keep refilling
his water when he's not looking.

01:56.497 --> 01:58.564
You're kidding.

01:58.566 --> 02:00.933
I don't care if we're in
a drought, it's worth it.

02:02.737 --> 02:06.605
You know, I-I do have a way
to get him out of our hair.

02:06.607 --> 02:09.041
I've been holding onto this
for a few years,

02:09.043 --> 02:11.009
but maybe now's the time.

02:11.012 --> 02:14.980
W-We can just lock the door;
you don't have to kill him.

02:14.982 --> 02:19.151
You can't kill him; he'll just
respawn at the last save point.

02:20.288 --> 02:24.056
Oh, that was my sixth trip
to the bathroom.

02:24.058 --> 02:26.358
As long as that's not
a urinary tract infection,

02:26.360 --> 02:28.894
that's a personal best.

02:28.896 --> 02:31.263
Hey, uh, buddy,
I got you a little present.

02:31.265 --> 02:32.631
Really?

02:32.633 --> 02:34.166
Yeah. Go ahead, open it.

02:37.004 --> 02:38.904
"Congratulations.

02:38.906 --> 02:41.841
"The bearer of this
certificate is entitled

02:41.843 --> 02:45.277
"to the ultimate
train experience

02:45.279 --> 02:47.947
"at The Nevada
Northern Railway.

02:47.949 --> 02:49.949
"You are at the throttle.

02:49.951 --> 02:52.785
"You are the engineer.

02:52.787 --> 02:55.287
You are running
the locomotive."

02:58.426 --> 03:00.693
This doesn't
happen very often,

03:00.695 --> 03:02.561
but here comes a hug.

03:06.501 --> 03:08.968
Oh, dear! I have
to tinkle again!

03:14.242 --> 03:17.009
Okay. Where were we?

03:18.279 --> 03:20.379
For Howie's occupation,

03:20.381 --> 03:22.548
should I include
that he was an astronaut?

03:22.550 --> 03:25.551
Well, he mentioned it in
his mother's eulogy, so why not?

03:26.454 --> 03:27.853
I can't believe you
have to fill out

03:27.855 --> 03:29.555
a preschool application
for an infant.

03:29.557 --> 03:31.790
Uh, the one at Caltech
has a crazy wait list.

03:31.792 --> 03:33.592
I warned you,
a lot of people apply

03:33.594 --> 03:35.394
when they're still pregnant.
Well, I didn't.

03:35.396 --> 03:39.732
I also skipped a birthing class
to see <i>Zootopia,</i> so back off.

03:39.734 --> 03:41.333
Whoa. Just trying to help.

03:41.335 --> 03:44.570
Sorry. Howie's back at work and
there's just so much going on.

03:44.572 --> 03:46.405
Is there anything
we can do?

03:46.407 --> 03:48.240
Sure. Open up a college fund,

03:48.242 --> 03:50.543
shop for life insurance,
and in the laundry room,

03:50.545 --> 03:52.311
there's a mountain
of dirty laundry.

03:52.313 --> 03:55.147
Wash it or burn in, your choice.

03:56.150 --> 03:58.184
(Halley crying over monitor)
Ugh, be right back.

03:58.186 --> 04:00.352
No, no. I will
take care of it.

04:00.354 --> 04:01.520
Oh, thank you.

04:01.522 --> 04:03.022
While I'm gone,
you can think about

04:03.024 --> 04:04.623
how mean you were to me.

04:04.625 --> 04:06.592
All right,
you know what you need?

04:06.594 --> 04:08.127
A night away from all of this.

04:08.129 --> 04:10.329
You know, where you can just
kind of relax and...

04:10.331 --> 04:11.797
(Halley continues crying
over monitor)

04:11.799 --> 04:14.433
I'm just gonna... turn this off.

04:14.435 --> 04:15.968
(Halley continues crying nearby)

04:18.372 --> 04:20.839
Much better. (clears throat)

04:21.742 --> 04:22.808
Seriously, let's plan a night,

04:22.810 --> 04:24.076
you know, give you a break.

04:24.078 --> 04:25.177
We could go dancing.

04:25.179 --> 04:27.613
That sounds really nice.
AMY: Oh.

04:27.615 --> 04:30.282
All this week, the Early
Music Society of Pasadena

04:30.284 --> 04:31.684
is doing a joint concert

04:31.686 --> 04:34.653
with the San Gabriel
Renaissance Choir.

04:35.623 --> 04:37.823
Okay, that's
the one to beat.

04:37.825 --> 04:39.692
Good luck.

04:39.694 --> 04:42.761
People have been saying that
for 600 years.

04:47.335 --> 04:48.534
Hey, you're home early.

04:48.536 --> 04:50.369
You'll never believe it.

04:50.371 --> 04:52.471
Leonard gave me
the most incredible gift,

04:52.473 --> 04:54.440
a trip to a historic railway,

04:54.442 --> 04:57.977
and I get to operate
an actual locomotive.

04:57.979 --> 05:00.779
Wow. He finally used it.

05:00.781 --> 05:03.249
What'd you do?

05:03.251 --> 05:04.617
No idea.

05:04.619 --> 05:07.052
All I know is I'm gonna be
working on the railroad

05:07.054 --> 05:09.021
all the livelong day.

05:09.023 --> 05:11.523
Well, I'm really happy for you.

05:11.525 --> 05:12.858
Oh, no. It's not just me. No.

05:12.860 --> 05:15.661
The railway is four hours
from the nearest airport,

05:15.663 --> 05:17.162
and guess who gets to drive me.

05:17.164 --> 05:18.597
I give up.

05:18.599 --> 05:19.498
You!

05:19.500 --> 05:21.433
No. I really give up.

05:21.435 --> 05:24.203
Oh, oh. And guess
where we get to sleep?

05:24.205 --> 05:25.971
Our choice of
a turn-of-the-century

05:25.973 --> 05:27.239
railway bunkhouse

05:27.241 --> 05:29.308
or a working caboose.

05:29.310 --> 05:31.810
Now, the problem with a caboose
is there's no bathroom,

05:31.812 --> 05:35.547
but the problem with the
bunkhouse is it's not a caboose.

05:36.350 --> 05:38.017
On the first day,

05:38.019 --> 05:40.085
I get to drive
a steam engine.

05:40.087 --> 05:42.521
Oh, and the second day,
a diesel engine.

05:42.523 --> 05:43.555
Oh, and

05:43.557 --> 05:45.491
if I volunteer to do
track maintenance

05:45.493 --> 05:48.360
and paperwork, they'll let me
stay as long as I want.

05:49.096 --> 05:50.329
So you might want to pack

05:50.331 --> 05:52.431
enough clothes
for the rest of our lives.

05:53.534 --> 05:56.368
Can I pee now?

05:56.370 --> 05:59.471
Oh, get this!

05:59.473 --> 06:04.109
I get to take a test
based on a 125-page manual.

06:04.111 --> 06:07.146
I get to learn things
like hand signals. Ooh.

06:07.148 --> 06:09.982
There's forward, uh, reverse,

06:09.984 --> 06:11.583
set the brakes.

06:11.585 --> 06:12.951
Are you done yet?

06:12.953 --> 06:15.888
You're missing
some great stuff out here.

06:15.890 --> 06:18.457
Oh, this is good.

06:19.727 --> 06:21.827
There are dozens of
railroad crossings

06:21.829 --> 06:23.796
you have to blow
the whistle for.

06:23.798 --> 06:26.231
But that is the figurative
you, not the literal you.

06:26.233 --> 06:28.100
I'll be blowing
the whistle.

06:29.036 --> 06:32.604
Amy, get up. It's
time to go to work.

06:32.606 --> 06:33.872
(groans)

06:35.042 --> 06:37.476
This train thing worked out
better than I thought.

06:37.478 --> 06:39.545
He's home studying
the engineer's manual.

06:39.547 --> 06:41.447
(sighs)

06:41.449 --> 06:43.349
It's so peaceful
without him here.

06:43.351 --> 06:45.417
Can I ask you
how much that cost?

06:45.419 --> 06:47.820
$4,000-- worth every penny.

06:47.822 --> 06:48.787
(knock on door)

06:48.789 --> 06:50.255
Gentlemen.

06:50.257 --> 06:51.323
Colonel Williams.
Sir.

06:51.325 --> 06:52.424
Just wanted to see how

06:52.426 --> 06:53.659
the guidance system's
coming along.

06:53.661 --> 06:54.960
Great. We found
a cooling solution

06:54.962 --> 06:57.196
that allowed us to get
the size of the prototype

06:57.198 --> 06:59.164
down to the target specs.

06:59.166 --> 07:01.633
As a cooling solution,
it's pretty cool.

07:01.635 --> 07:02.835
(chuckles)

07:02.837 --> 07:04.770
Don't do that.

07:07.141 --> 07:08.307
What's this?

07:08.309 --> 07:10.342
Oh, nothing.
Just some math we don't need.

07:10.344 --> 07:11.744
This is a different approach.

07:11.746 --> 07:14.747
Are you trying to get the
guidance system even smaller?

07:14.749 --> 07:16.782
It's just a theory.

07:16.784 --> 07:18.450
Uh, it's not even worked out.

07:18.452 --> 07:20.619
Oh. (chuckles)

07:20.621 --> 07:22.354
I want this.

07:23.324 --> 07:26.325
But we've already met
the agreed upon specs.

07:26.327 --> 07:28.794
Going smaller would
require weeks' worth

07:28.796 --> 07:30.262
of new computations.

07:30.264 --> 07:33.565
So get the kid with
the two shirts to do it.

07:34.969 --> 07:37.870
Sir, uh, i-if I may,
uh, we've put a lot

07:37.872 --> 07:41.039
of thought and effort into
this current prototype.

07:41.041 --> 07:42.908
It's a really
elegant solution,

07:42.910 --> 07:44.777
and most importantly,
it works.

07:45.579 --> 07:47.112
Yeah, I want this.

07:48.516 --> 07:49.848
But that's just a theory.

07:49.850 --> 07:51.350
It's not even a
complete thought.

07:51.352 --> 07:53.419
You both make excellent points.

07:53.421 --> 07:55.220
And thank you for
presenting it so articulately.

07:55.222 --> 07:57.456
(chuckles) Make this.

08:00.728 --> 08:02.561
(door closes)

08:02.563 --> 08:06.131
The kid with the two
shirts screwed us again.

08:07.234 --> 08:10.436
All right. You guys
ready to get crazy?

08:10.438 --> 08:13.305
Well, the bra
under here ain't beige.

08:13.307 --> 08:15.174
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Okay.

08:15.176 --> 08:17.309
You ladies
have fun tonight.

08:17.311 --> 08:19.745
Don't worry about Halley.
Uncle Stuart's on the job.

08:19.747 --> 08:22.781
Under the careful supervision
of her godfather.

08:22.783 --> 08:26.618
My apologies. I didn't mean
to offend you, Don Corleone.

08:26.620 --> 08:29.087
Like I said,
you ladies have fun.

08:29.089 --> 08:31.490
We will. Got my dancing shoes,
got my breast pump.

08:31.492 --> 08:33.091
Let's party.

08:33.092 --> 08:34.927
You know, if you
pump at the bar,

08:34.929 --> 08:37.095
I promise we'll
get free drinks.

08:37.097 --> 08:38.797
Call if there's any problems.

08:38.799 --> 08:40.466
No. She's busy.
You call Howard.

08:40.467 --> 08:41.332
Got it.

08:41.335 --> 08:44.001
Call me. Don't call Howard.

08:44.004 --> 08:46.104
I would never call Howard.

08:48.008 --> 08:50.375
Okay, instead of
arguing all night,

08:50.377 --> 08:52.044
let's just split up
the baby chores.

08:52.046 --> 08:54.480
Yeah, great. Um, I'll put
food in her top half,

08:54.482 --> 08:56.815
you deal with whatever
comes out the bottom.

08:59.787 --> 09:02.187
I can't believe we
have to ask Sheldon

09:02.189 --> 09:03.755
to come back
and help us.

09:03.757 --> 09:04.756
Oh, boo-hoo.

09:04.758 --> 09:06.391
I spent four grand on a gift

09:06.393 --> 09:09.194
that only got rid of him
for an afternoon.

09:10.631 --> 09:12.831
(electrical crackling)

09:15.903 --> 09:17.436
What is that?

09:17.438 --> 09:19.171
I don't know,
but if he yells,

09:19.173 --> 09:22.040
"It's alive," we run.

09:28.649 --> 09:30.015
Oh, hey.

09:30.017 --> 09:31.783
If you knocked,
I couldn't hear you.

09:31.785 --> 09:33.719
I'm welding
this locomotive engine.

09:35.589 --> 09:38.590
And if you didn't knock,
how about some manners?

09:40.027 --> 09:42.394
How'd you even get
that up the stairs?

09:42.396 --> 09:45.564
I said to myself,
"I think I can, I think I can."

09:47.334 --> 09:49.902
And then I couldn't, so...

09:49.904 --> 09:53.872
I paid two men who promised
not to come rob us later.

09:53.874 --> 09:56.008
Okay, look, Sheldon,
the Colonel wants us

09:56.010 --> 09:57.643
to make the guidance system
smaller,

09:57.645 --> 09:59.444
and we can't
do it without you.

09:59.446 --> 10:01.246
Interesting.

10:01.248 --> 10:03.215
Well, so I was right.

10:03.217 --> 10:06.418
Open a window. It's about
to get smug in here.

10:07.922 --> 10:09.354
Well, I would love to help you,

10:09.356 --> 10:11.290
but since I discovered
the satisfaction

10:11.292 --> 10:13.792
of working with my hands
on a train engine,

10:13.794 --> 10:15.894
I don't think
I can go back to theory.

10:16.497 --> 10:18.697
I'm an engineer now.

10:19.533 --> 10:21.166
And, hey,
just to be clear,

10:21.168 --> 10:23.435
a train engineer.

10:24.738 --> 10:27.272
Not that goofy kind you are.

10:29.000 --> 10:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:36.945 --> 10:39.379
Sheldon, you can still go
on the trip in a few weeks.

10:39.381 --> 10:40.580
Just help us out.

10:40.582 --> 10:42.382
Sorry. I need to work
on this engine

10:42.384 --> 10:45.685
so when I get to the train yard
I won't look foolish.

10:45.687 --> 10:46.819
(laughs)

10:46.821 --> 10:48.287
He's worried about
looking foolish.

10:48.289 --> 10:50.957
That's a heapin' helping
of irony right there.

10:52.560 --> 10:54.293
Come on, you know
you're not leaving physics.

10:54.295 --> 10:55.428
Why are you doing this?

10:55.430 --> 10:59.766
Leonard, in the world
of theoretical physics,

10:59.768 --> 11:02.535
you never finish;
so much is unprovable.

11:02.537 --> 11:03.770
But when I was studying

11:03.772 --> 11:06.739
that railway guide,
it was so tangible

11:06.741 --> 11:10.443
and so satisfying
that something just clicked.

11:10.445 --> 11:12.478
Then it clacked.

11:12.480 --> 11:13.813
Then it clicked,

11:13.815 --> 11:16.816
then it clacked, click-clack
clickety-clack, and here we are.

11:16.818 --> 11:19.519
(imitates train whistle):
Whoo-whoo!

11:22.157 --> 11:24.757
Did you hear anything back
from the Caltech preschool?

11:24.759 --> 11:27.427
Not yet, but we're gonna apply
to a bunch of others

11:27.429 --> 11:28.861
just to keep our options open.

11:28.863 --> 11:30.596
Okay, stop that!
No more preschool talk.

11:30.598 --> 11:31.931
Tonight is about
having fun.

11:31.933 --> 11:34.901
Nothing says fun
like being scolded.

11:34.903 --> 11:37.870
(ringtone playing)

11:37.872 --> 11:39.439
It's Raj.

11:39.441 --> 11:40.973
Everything okay?

11:40.975 --> 11:44.343
Don't worry. Everything's fine.

11:44.345 --> 11:46.846
Hang up!
We don't need help.

11:46.848 --> 11:49.215
I don't need your help
deciding when we need help!

11:51.086 --> 11:52.385
Raj, what's going on?

11:52.387 --> 11:53.653
Yes, so,

11:53.655 --> 11:56.289
I was just warming up
some milk for Halley,

11:56.291 --> 11:58.291
and I-I thought
it smelled a little funky,

11:58.293 --> 12:01.094
so I checked the date
that you wrote on the bottle,

12:01.096 --> 12:02.995
and it says "Flerbsday."

12:02.997 --> 12:05.431
It says "Tuesday."

12:05.433 --> 12:07.333
How is that a "T"?!

12:08.536 --> 12:10.903
I'm sure it's fine,
but if you're worried,

12:10.905 --> 12:12.371
there's extra milk
in the freezer.

12:12.373 --> 12:13.673
Okay, yes,

12:13.675 --> 12:15.742
I will err
on the side of caution

12:15.744 --> 12:17.877
and defrost a fresh batch.

12:17.879 --> 12:19.879
You're wasting
perfectly good milk.

12:19.881 --> 12:22.148
Fine, you drink it.
It's just milk.

12:22.150 --> 12:24.016
Stuart, don't you drink my milk!

12:25.653 --> 12:26.886
Okay, give--

12:26.888 --> 12:28.755
Can you guys
handle this or not?

12:28.757 --> 12:31.891
Oh, of course we can.
Uh, you girls have a good time.

12:31.893 --> 12:32.892
(chuckles)

12:32.894 --> 12:35.595
She said I was in charge.

12:36.464 --> 12:38.898
Hmm.

12:38.900 --> 12:40.399
So we just
throw this away?

12:40.401 --> 12:42.068
What else are you
gonna do with it?

12:42.070 --> 12:43.136
Put it in your coffee?

12:43.138 --> 12:45.404
Well, I don't take it black.

12:48.710 --> 12:51.277
Okay. This is everything
he had on the board.

12:51.279 --> 12:53.112
I'm sure we can
figure the rest out.

12:53.114 --> 12:54.847
All right.
(clears throat)

12:54.849 --> 12:57.016
Hmm.

12:58.953 --> 13:00.620
Feel free to jump in.

13:00.622 --> 13:03.689
"Hmm" is all I got.

13:03.691 --> 13:05.892
Oh, we can get this.

13:07.328 --> 13:09.762
Is there any chance
it's upside-down?

13:11.833 --> 13:12.965
Maybe we can find

13:12.967 --> 13:14.600
another theoretical
physicist to help us.

13:14.602 --> 13:17.537
It's classified. If we tell
anyone, we'd get in trouble.

13:17.539 --> 13:19.105
Hey, I came up with
that and "hmm."

13:19.107 --> 13:20.173
You haven't
pitched anything.

13:20.175 --> 13:22.241
Just keep thinking.

13:25.280 --> 13:27.013
I got it.

13:29.951 --> 13:32.418
You really figured it out?

13:32.420 --> 13:36.622
No, but when we show
this nonsense to Sheldon,

13:36.624 --> 13:40.726
it will make him crazy,
and he'll have to fix it.

13:40.728 --> 13:42.395
Oh, you're a genius.

13:42.397 --> 13:44.096
Yeah, I know.

13:44.098 --> 13:45.498
That's not even a math symbol.

13:45.500 --> 13:47.300
That's just
Charlie Brown's hair.

13:50.872 --> 13:52.171
Sorry, guys.

13:52.173 --> 13:53.439
This club was so great.

13:53.441 --> 13:55.441
How could they turn
it into a bookstore?

13:55.443 --> 13:58.277
I thought
we got rid of all those.

13:58.279 --> 14:01.781
Renaissance Choir's looking
pretty good right now, huh?

14:01.783 --> 14:03.683
(ringtone playing)

14:03.685 --> 14:06.018
Hello?

14:06.020 --> 14:08.020
(Halley crying)
Nothing to worry about.

14:08.022 --> 14:09.422
She's just been

14:09.424 --> 14:11.490
crying for a little while,
and I was wondering

14:11.492 --> 14:13.826
if you had any tricks
to get her to sleep.

14:13.828 --> 14:17.463
She was sleeping just fine
till you took a selfie with her!

14:17.465 --> 14:20.499
She was blowing a spit bubble.
It was adorable!

14:22.337 --> 14:24.570
You guys got this?
Do you need me to come home?

14:24.572 --> 14:26.539
(whispers):
Wait.

14:26.541 --> 14:28.074
She's settling down.
(Halley quiets)

14:28.076 --> 14:29.842
Oh, okay, false alarm.

14:29.844 --> 14:31.310
Little parenting tip:

14:31.312 --> 14:33.412
sleeping babies
hate flash photography.

14:34.816 --> 14:36.849
Is everything okay?

14:36.851 --> 14:37.950
Yeah.

14:37.952 --> 14:40.019
I may have just left
my infant daughter

14:40.021 --> 14:42.521
with Patrick and SpongeBob.

14:43.558 --> 14:46.058
Hey, there's another
dance club nearby.

14:46.060 --> 14:49.028
I mean, I don't know how
you feel about Latin music,

14:49.030 --> 14:53.132
but according to their <i>horas</i>
of <i>operación,</i> they're open.

14:53.134 --> 14:55.201
Maybe we should just
call it a night.

14:55.203 --> 14:57.436
You sure?
They're open till <i>dos.</i>

14:57.438 --> 14:59.739
Yeah, we're all
dressed up.

14:59.741 --> 15:01.040
Why go home?

15:01.042 --> 15:03.276
I'm just not really
in the mood anymore.

15:03.278 --> 15:04.477
What's going on with you?

15:04.479 --> 15:06.379
I don't know.
This is all starting to feel

15:06.381 --> 15:08.514
like a sad attempt
to recapture our youth.

15:08.516 --> 15:09.949
I'm not sad.

15:09.951 --> 15:12.919
I just wanted to get drunk
and not wear sweatpants.

15:14.122 --> 15:15.154
I'm not sad.

15:15.156 --> 15:17.924
I mean, hello.

15:20.128 --> 15:21.594
Okay, maybe I'm the one
who's sad.

15:21.596 --> 15:23.329
What are you sad about?

15:23.331 --> 15:25.932
Maybe the fact that you
went and had a baby.

15:25.934 --> 15:27.700
You're upset I had a baby?

15:27.702 --> 15:29.235
No, of course not. I just...

15:29.237 --> 15:31.737
I didn't think it would make me
have all these feelings.

15:31.739 --> 15:33.406
What feelings?

15:33.408 --> 15:34.707
Pressure!

15:34.709 --> 15:36.108
I mean, she's looking
at preschools,

15:36.110 --> 15:37.944
she has a minivan,
she has a 401(k).

15:37.946 --> 15:41.580
Before she talked about it,
I just thought that was a race.

15:41.582 --> 15:43.649
You think that stuff is fun?

15:43.651 --> 15:45.484
Being a parent is terrifying.

15:45.486 --> 15:48.387
I'm constantly worried,
I'm always tired,

15:48.389 --> 15:50.656
and in a few minutes,
I'm gonna milk myself

15:50.658 --> 15:52.792
in a bookstore parking lot.

15:52.794 --> 15:54.260
I get that, okay?

15:54.262 --> 15:56.462
It's just, Leonard and I have
been married for two years,

15:56.464 --> 15:58.664
and we're no further along
than when we were dating.

15:58.666 --> 15:59.799
AMY:
Come on.

15:59.801 --> 16:01.634
You've got so much
to feel good about.

16:01.636 --> 16:03.069
You've got a
great job now.

16:03.071 --> 16:05.838
Yeah, I guess
I am making decent money.

16:05.840 --> 16:07.640
You make more than I do.

16:07.642 --> 16:10.309
You may not have a house yet,
but your apartment's great.

16:10.311 --> 16:12.011
It's bigger than mine.

16:12.013 --> 16:14.513
And Leonard loves you so much,
he married you twice.

16:15.516 --> 16:17.516
I'm not even engaged once.

16:17.518 --> 16:20.086
I don't even know if Sheldon
thinks about marriage.

16:20.088 --> 16:21.387
I'm not getting any younger.

16:21.389 --> 16:23.556
Honestly,
I kind of thought by now,

16:23.558 --> 16:25.257
we might have had
some sort of...

16:25.259 --> 16:28.995
Careful. The sound of crying
can make me lactate.

16:28.997 --> 16:30.529
I'm sorry. I can't help it.

16:30.531 --> 16:31.530
(crying)

16:31.532 --> 16:33.666
Oh, that's gonna make me cry.

16:33.668 --> 16:34.834
(crying)

16:34.836 --> 16:37.636
And there they go.

16:39.273 --> 16:41.707
Ew.

16:45.546 --> 16:49.248
Well, Sheldon, turns out
we didn't need you after all.

16:49.250 --> 16:52.685
That's right. We figured
it out all by ourselves.

16:52.687 --> 16:55.021
Wasn't even that hard.
No.

16:55.023 --> 16:56.822
Well, good for you guys.

16:56.824 --> 17:00.760
Look, I have a grease smudge on
my hand, and I'm okay with it.

17:00.762 --> 17:04.329
Aren't you gonna look at the
board to see how right we are?

17:04.332 --> 17:07.333
No, thanks. I'm busy trying
to fix this fuel pump.

17:07.335 --> 17:08.166
It's a manifold.

17:08.169 --> 17:10.236
Oh.

17:10.238 --> 17:12.003
Well, I guess it's fixed.

17:13.307 --> 17:15.340
Just look at
the board.

17:15.343 --> 17:16.175
That's wrong.

17:16.176 --> 17:18.978
Oh, no!

17:21.148 --> 17:24.215
What should we have
done differently?

17:24.218 --> 17:26.952
Well, first of all,
you can't use relativistic

17:26.954 --> 17:29.688
and non-relativistic vectors
in the same equation.

17:29.690 --> 17:31.524
Told ya. (scoffs)

17:32.727 --> 17:34.260
Can you fix it for us?

17:34.262 --> 17:35.728
(sighs)

17:35.730 --> 17:38.097
Okay, but this is
the last time.

17:54.515 --> 17:56.348
Nice try, blockheads.

17:58.119 --> 18:00.920
Come on, Sheldon. You can't
turn your back on physics.

18:00.922 --> 18:02.888
Besides, you have no idea what
you're doing with this stuff.

18:02.890 --> 18:05.124
But if you really want
to learn the mechanical side,

18:05.126 --> 18:06.892
I can teach you anything
you want to know.

18:06.894 --> 18:08.594
LEONARD: And instead of
standing around watching,

18:08.596 --> 18:11.263
you can help us build your
smaller guidance system.

18:11.265 --> 18:12.698
And with all these new skills,

18:12.700 --> 18:14.533
you'd be able
to fix any model train.

18:14.535 --> 18:17.169
You'd be the king
of the train store!

18:17.171 --> 18:18.771
Excuse me. I have a girlfriend.

18:18.773 --> 18:21.240
I'm already king
of the train store.

18:22.977 --> 18:24.877
So, what do you say?

18:24.879 --> 18:27.480
Oh, what choice do I have?
You need me.

18:27.482 --> 18:30.216
I'm like the crankshaft
of this team.

18:30.218 --> 18:32.551
That's a turbo.

18:32.553 --> 18:33.786
Well, whatever it is,
it looks heavy.

18:33.788 --> 18:35.521
I'm gonna need you two
to get it downstairs

18:35.523 --> 18:36.722
before Amy comes home.

18:47.369 --> 18:49.602
(train chugging,
steam hissing)

18:49.604 --> 18:53.039
(train whistle blows)

18:58.880 --> 19:02.282
I apologize
that it's so warm in here.

19:02.284 --> 19:04.851
It <i>is</i> warm in here.

19:10.993 --> 19:13.426
I've worked up a bit of a sweat.

19:13.428 --> 19:16.463
Me, too.

19:19.067 --> 19:21.401
May I borrow your water?

Sorry.

GPS says we'll be at the railway
in three hours.

19:54.598 --> 19:56.278
I can get us there in two.
