WEBVTT

00:11.261 --> 00:12.041
Okay.

00:13.611 --> 00:14.501
Ready?

00:14.501 --> 00:16.481
Give me a second!

00:17.351 --> 00:19.101
- Ready. - Stare!

00:27.431 --> 00:29.921
Ooh, I think you gonna blink!

00:29.921 --> 00:31.071
Yeah, right.

00:38.821 --> 00:41.871
Hey, no laser pointers! That's not regulation!

00:41.871 --> 00:43.381
Street rules, man!

00:43.381 --> 00:44.271
What are you doing?

00:44.271 --> 00:47.221
I asked you to wash the truck 20 minutes ago!

00:47.261 --> 00:49.731
I can't trust you guys to do anything!

00:50.531 --> 00:52.231
We were just taking a break!

01:00.711 --> 01:01.921
- I-- - Bosses!

01:01.961 --> 01:04.331
- Are you sick of slackers? - Yeah.

01:04.331 --> 01:06.071
Is this a familiar sight?

01:06.881 --> 01:09.101
Well, turn this... to this!

01:09.101 --> 01:11.971
Peeps! Get your workers to work harder!

01:12.061 --> 01:13.041
Thanks, Peeps!

01:13.041 --> 01:14.761
Now with 4 different levels!

01:14.761 --> 01:17.401
Level 1, Level 2, Level 3,

01:17.411 --> 01:19.811
and for the ultimate in worker productivity...

01:19.811 --> 01:22.061
Jeepers Peepers X-Infinity,

01:22.071 --> 01:24.231
with a Peeps lifetime guarantee!

01:24.231 --> 01:26.611
Act now and get the Peeps lens cleaning kit,

01:26.671 --> 01:27.391
free!

01:27.421 --> 01:28.331
Call now!

01:28.331 --> 01:30.541
Cleaning can be extremely flammable. Offer not valid or void.

01:30.541 --> 01:33.011
Peeps may be illegal in your country or province. Requires sign...

01:34.501 --> 01:35.601
Hey, you two!

01:37.441 --> 01:39.611
Hey Benson. We were just getting back to work.

01:39.611 --> 01:41.611
It's okay, Mordecai. I trust you.

01:42.321 --> 01:43.291
Really?

01:43.541 --> 01:44.521
Of course I do,

01:44.521 --> 01:46.041
because now I have this!

01:49.401 --> 01:52.331
Say hello to Peeps. It's a surveillance system.

01:52.461 --> 01:55.551
Now I'll be able to see what you're up to all the time,

01:55.581 --> 01:59.541
24/7, 365. Isn't that great?

02:00.111 --> 02:03.401
Well, I'll let you guys finish your work. And remember,

02:03.891 --> 02:05.021
I'm watching you!

02:09.621 --> 02:12.011
Dude, I don't think Benson trusts us at all.

02:12.011 --> 02:13.071
Of course he doesn't.

02:13.091 --> 02:14.981
He just put a camera in front of us.

02:14.981 --> 02:16.251
What's the big deal, anyway?

02:16.251 --> 02:18.511
I mean, we were working. We're gonna get it done.

02:18.561 --> 02:21.411
Come on. We'll show him. We'll get this done in no time.

02:29.151 --> 02:31.851
Dude, forget this. Let's just finish our staring contest.

02:31.851 --> 02:34.421
We can't. Benson's watching us.

02:37.971 --> 02:39.491
You gotta check this out, Skips.

02:39.491 --> 02:41.661
Those slackers are finally working.

02:41.801 --> 02:44.301
Yep, Peeps is working like a charm.

02:44.871 --> 02:47.771
- Why is there a jet outside? - Huh?

02:49.151 --> 02:50.101
What?!

02:53.031 --> 02:54.301
Oh! Benson, uh--

02:54.301 --> 02:56.561
Get back to work! Now!

02:57.731 --> 03:00.471
I'm gonna take those slackers to level 2.

03:00.561 --> 03:03.091
You have reached Peeps. Please hold.

03:09.001 --> 03:11.151
This sucks.

03:11.161 --> 03:13.841
I know! Mine's really chaffing me.

03:14.001 --> 03:17.791
Well, at least we're on break. We can finish our staring contest.

03:17.841 --> 03:19.551
Yeah, it's on.

03:22.981 --> 03:25.411
- Ugh, this is lame. - Next.

03:25.411 --> 03:27.941
Hey guys! What's with the cameras?

03:27.971 --> 03:29.371
These? Um,

03:29.591 --> 03:31.491
we're making an Indie documentary.

03:31.491 --> 03:33.191
Whoa, that's cool!

03:33.231 --> 03:36.131
Yeah, it's pretty obscure arthouse stuff.

03:36.271 --> 03:38.811
It's so Indie, only one dude's gonna see it.

03:38.811 --> 03:39.911
What's it called?

03:39.921 --> 03:41.881
It's called Slackers II!

03:41.971 --> 03:45.721
The Return of Mordecai and Rigby To Their Jobs".

03:45.821 --> 03:47.291
Break's over!

03:47.341 --> 03:49.331
Uh, I guess we'll take two lattes.

03:49.331 --> 03:50.271
To go!

03:55.991 --> 03:59.611
Ooh! What a fancy new fangled giga!

03:59.731 --> 04:01.221
How does it work?

04:01.341 --> 04:02.781
Pops, come here and I'll show you.

04:02.831 --> 04:04.291
It's called Peeps.

04:04.301 --> 04:07.551
This window here is hooked up to a camera on Rigby

04:07.671 --> 04:10.371
and this one is hooked up to Mordecai.

04:10.531 --> 04:13.111
It's foolproof. They'll never slack off again!

04:13.801 --> 04:15.421
Oh, I meant that!

04:17.810 --> 04:21.130
I can't believe they've been working for 3 hours!

04:21.130 --> 04:24.491
3 hours? They deserve an award!

04:25.271 --> 04:26.061
Good idea.

04:26.091 --> 04:28.691
Time to bust out the Employee Incentives.

04:28.871 --> 04:31.011
I hope these babies are still good.

04:31.811 --> 04:37.611
Luigi's One Free Personal Pizza with purchase of equal or greater pizza!

04:37.651 --> 04:38.441
Let's go!

04:39.011 --> 04:41.861
Mordecai and Rigby, we've got coupons!

04:41.861 --> 04:42.911
What the?

04:47.891 --> 04:51.371
World Dishwashing Championship 1982?!

04:51.371 --> 04:53.341
- You blinked! - You wish!

04:53.421 --> 04:55.651
That's it! I gotta make a phone call.

05:02.891 --> 05:03.721
Rigby!

05:05.461 --> 05:06.661
What the?

05:11.371 --> 05:12.271
Crap!.

05:23.581 --> 05:26.301
Dude, this has to stop.

05:31.441 --> 05:33.471
Did you bring the hacking device?

05:44.721 --> 05:46.241
Huh? What the?!

05:52.131 --> 05:54.091
Peeps Surveillance Systems.

05:54.091 --> 05:59.051
Yeah. Upgrade me to Jeepers Peepers X-Infinity! NOW!

05:59.051 --> 06:00.321
I'm sorry, sir,

06:00.341 --> 06:04.311
but that requires a signature on our lifetime contract.

06:05.931 --> 06:08.461
All right, whatever! Just make it happen!

06:08.461 --> 06:09.891
One moment, please.

06:13.011 --> 06:13.561
There!

06:13.561 --> 06:16.571
Thank you for choosing Peeps Surveillance Systems.

06:16.571 --> 06:17.951
Have a nice day.

06:31.291 --> 06:32.461
What are you?!

06:32.581 --> 06:34.061
I'm Peeps.

07:08.931 --> 07:11.021
Benson! This has gone too far!

07:11.021 --> 07:13.051
Yeah. I can't work.

07:13.051 --> 07:15.991
I haven't been able to sleep in a fortnight!

07:15.991 --> 07:20.211
I've been so stressed that I'm losing muscle mass!

07:20.211 --> 07:21.131
I know guys.

07:21.151 --> 07:22.811
I'm gonna take care of this mess.

07:22.981 --> 07:25.001
Peeps! Hey Peeps!

07:26.771 --> 07:27.741
Yes?

07:27.891 --> 07:30.191
Listen, Peeps. You're creeping everybody out.

07:30.221 --> 07:31.091
You've got to go.

07:31.131 --> 07:32.761
I'm here to stay.

07:32.801 --> 07:35.881
If you've read the lifetime guarantee that you signed,

07:35.931 --> 07:43.261
I'm going to watch you 24/7, 365, until you die.

07:44.471 --> 07:47.001
That's cool. I made copies!

07:47.041 --> 07:49.801
Peeps? We've got a proposition for you.

07:49.801 --> 07:51.471
Oh yeah, what?

07:51.471 --> 07:53.471
A staring contest.

07:54.741 --> 07:57.151
If we win you have to leave the park.

07:57.181 --> 07:57.891
What?

07:59.131 --> 08:03.051
Are you kidding me? You don't stand a chance.

08:03.051 --> 08:05.941
You're the one that doesn't have a chance, you giant eyesack!

08:06.511 --> 08:08.811
Fine. But if I win,

08:08.851 --> 08:13.461
I'm taking your eyes. All of your eyes.

08:14.191 --> 08:15.341
Accepted.

08:15.381 --> 08:16.051
Wait a minute!

08:16.051 --> 08:18.061
You guys can't even do the dishes.

08:18.071 --> 08:19.621
How can I trust you to win?

08:19.651 --> 08:20.941
It's true, Benson.

08:20.981 --> 08:23.881
You can't trust us to do the dishes or wash the truck.

08:23.881 --> 08:26.841
And you also can't trust us not to fart in your coffee when you're not looking.

08:26.841 --> 08:28.081
- What? - Nothing.

08:28.081 --> 08:30.141
But what you can trust us is at

08:30.181 --> 08:32.510
pointless skills during work time.

08:32.910 --> 08:35.410
I really can't argue with that.

08:35.591 --> 08:37.351
I guess it's our only chance.

08:37.390 --> 08:39.721
So, which one of you is it gonna be then?

08:39.721 --> 08:41.361
Mordecai, you should do it.

08:41.361 --> 08:44.140
You're a way better starer than me. Ice this fool!

08:44.140 --> 08:47.931
Mordecai, your eyeballs are mine.

08:50.741 --> 08:51.851
Ready,

08:52.311 --> 08:53.101
set,

08:53.231 --> 08:54.941
stare!

09:11.081 --> 09:13.831
Peeps is gonna blink! You got this, Mordecai!

09:19.171 --> 09:20.461
Hey, that's cheating!

09:20.461 --> 09:22.461
I'm not blinking, am I?

09:23.431 --> 09:30.371
Don't blink! Don't blink, don't blink...

09:32.181 --> 09:34.961
- Hey, that's cheating! - You cheated first!

09:35.041 --> 09:38.731
Now it's time to kiss your greasy eye sacks good night!

09:56.151 --> 09:59.201
My retinas! They burn!

09:59.201 --> 10:02.431
Hey, Peeps! Don't blink!

10:12.741 --> 10:14.921
This isn't a regulation, you know.

10:14.921 --> 10:16.331
Street rules, man!

10:27.961 --> 10:30.411
All I see is darkness.

10:34.401 --> 10:36.981
Get out and stay out!

10:37.021 --> 10:40.301
And you two, I hope you learned something from all this.

10:40.301 --> 10:42.091
Yeah, make sure we do our chores

10:42.091 --> 10:44.161
so you don't nark on us to a giant eyeball.

10:44.161 --> 10:47.121
I learned that Mordecai can go for a really long time

10:47.121 --> 10:48.271
for a really long time without blinking.

10:48.381 --> 10:50.901
Actually, my eyes won't blink anymore.

10:52.811 --> 10:55.311
Uh... does anybody have any eyedrops?

10:59.041 --> 11:00.341
Take me to the hospital.
