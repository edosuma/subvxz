00:36.150 --> 00:38.277
At the beginning of
the 21st century

00:38.485 --> 00:40.529
the Umbrella Corporation
had become

00:40.696 --> 00:42.781
the largest commercial entity
in the U.S.

00:43.157 --> 00:45.951
Nine out of every ten homes
contain its products.

00:46.118 --> 00:49.705
Its political and financial
influence is felt everywhere.

00:50.456 --> 00:53.167
In public, it is the world's
leading supplier of...

00:53.334 --> 00:56.962
computer technology, medical
products and healthcare.

00:57.212 --> 00:59.173
Unknown even to
its own employees,

00:59.340 --> 01:01.383
its massive profíts
are generated by...

01:01.550 --> 01:02.927
military technology,

01:03.093 --> 01:06.096
genetic experimentation
and viral weaponry.

02:52.995 --> 02:56.415
All Umbrella staff must
wear their identity tags...

02:56.582 --> 02:58.751
at all times.

02:59.043 --> 03:00.377
All radiation badges...

03:00.544 --> 03:03.672
will be collected
at 5 this afternoon.

03:04.048 --> 03:05.132
Thank you!

03:05.674 --> 03:06.634
God!

03:09.261 --> 03:10.429
Some people.

03:41.669 --> 03:43.379
- Don't show me.
- Why not?

03:43.546 --> 03:45.339
Because I'm busy.

03:51.804 --> 03:53.806
It's nothing. Fire drill.

04:04.483 --> 04:06.819
- What is that?
- Fire drill.

04:11.699 --> 04:13.242
- Shit!
- What's going on?

04:13.409 --> 04:16.245
- Get the computers covered! Move it!
- I'm trying!

04:16.411 --> 04:18.329
Move the experiments!

04:27.965 --> 04:31.176
Shouldn't the doors open
or something?

04:31.468 --> 04:33.888
It's supposed to take us
to the nearest floor.

04:39.435 --> 04:40.227
Hello?

04:41.687 --> 04:42.479
Hello?

04:42.938 --> 04:44.356
What's happening?

04:47.318 --> 04:48.611
Line's dead.

04:49.153 --> 04:51.655
Is that a drill? Come on!

04:51.822 --> 04:54.074
- What's the problem?
- The doors won't open.

04:54.241 --> 04:56.702
- The ones at the back?
- Locked as well.

04:57.119 --> 04:59.663
There's no fire here!
No fire!

05:01.624 --> 05:04.335
- There's no fire here! No fire!
- The code doesn't work!

05:04.627 --> 05:06.503
- What's wrong with you?
- The door won't open!

05:06.670 --> 05:08.714
- And this water isn't going anywhere.
- What?

05:09.256 --> 05:10.633
It's a sealed room.

05:10.883 --> 05:13.302
- Help me with the door!
- Fuck the doors!

05:22.519 --> 05:24.104
We have to get out of here.

05:24.897 --> 05:26.190
What's going on?

05:26.732 --> 05:30.736
Has this happened before?
We have to get out of here.

05:30.903 --> 05:32.863
- Take it easy.
- You take it easy!

05:33.030 --> 05:33.906
Quiet!

05:35.866 --> 05:36.784
Quiet.

05:38.077 --> 05:39.370
What is that?

05:54.635 --> 05:55.886
Oh, my God!

06:27.501 --> 06:28.335
Halon!

06:32.923 --> 06:34.300
Stop it!

06:35.342 --> 06:37.636
Stop it! Stop!

07:13.839 --> 07:14.965
Let me see.

07:21.388 --> 07:24.892
We have to get out of here.
We have to get out of this building.

07:25.351 --> 07:26.894
Here, give me a hand.

07:28.145 --> 07:31.106
That's as far as they'll go.
They're caught on something.

07:31.357 --> 07:33.776
That's wide enough.
I can squeeze through.

07:34.526 --> 07:35.611
I'll get help.

07:42.201 --> 07:44.954
I'm stuck. You'll have to push.

07:46.580 --> 07:49.041
That's it. A bit more.

07:51.418 --> 07:52.461
What was that?

07:54.338 --> 07:56.632
Oh, Christ!
It's the brakes!

07:56.840 --> 07:59.927
- Get out! We have to get out!
- I can't move!

08:00.427 --> 08:02.221
I can't move!

08:08.102 --> 08:09.061
Oh, my God!

08:09.228 --> 08:11.939
- Push her out of the way!
- Pull me back inside!

08:12.731 --> 08:14.191
Pull me back inside!

08:15.442 --> 08:18.028
Pull me back inside!

10:24.697 --> 10:26.699
Today all your dreams come true.

10:31.829 --> 10:33.247
Today all your...

11:44.735 --> 11:45.778
Hello?

12:39.873 --> 12:40.541
Hello?

13:04.023 --> 13:05.232
Who are you?

13:05.566 --> 13:08.235
Don't touch me.
Get away from me!

13:08.402 --> 13:09.320
Down!

13:21.332 --> 13:23.292
What are you doing? I'm a cop!

13:24.627 --> 13:26.212
I told you. I'm a cop.

13:32.885 --> 13:34.470
You're breaking my arm.

13:42.311 --> 13:43.270
Report.

13:47.483 --> 13:48.567
Report now.

13:48.943 --> 13:49.944
What?

13:51.695 --> 13:53.489
I want your report, soldier.

13:53.656 --> 13:55.658
I don't know
what you're talking about.

13:55.824 --> 13:59.078
Sir, the house's primary
defenses were activated.

13:59.370 --> 14:01.789
She's probably suffering
side effects.

14:02.122 --> 14:05.042
- What are you doing with us?
- What about the cop?

14:05.209 --> 14:08.045
Matthew Addison.
I'm not getting a match.

14:09.088 --> 14:10.172
Who are you?

14:10.339 --> 14:13.425
I just transferred. They probably
don't have me on file yet.

14:13.592 --> 14:15.636
The locals are inefficient.
It's possible.

14:16.345 --> 14:17.846
Should I secure him here?

14:22.184 --> 14:24.019
No. We take him with us.

14:26.105 --> 14:27.606
You can't do this.

14:30.985 --> 14:32.152
Blow me.

14:34.572 --> 14:36.240
Prep for entry to the Hive.

15:44.934 --> 15:46.769
- Power's down.
- So fix it.

15:46.936 --> 15:48.103
I'm on it.

16:44.827 --> 16:46.245
Are you done yet?

16:46.996 --> 16:48.163
Jumpy!

17:00.426 --> 17:01.677
Stand clear!

17:31.999 --> 17:34.835
- You got a pro blem?
- How's that door?

17:35.002 --> 17:36.962
- Sealed shut.
- Let me.

17:52.728 --> 17:54.063
Jumpy?

18:25.970 --> 18:27.096
Lie still.

18:27.930 --> 18:29.181
Lie still!

18:30.307 --> 18:31.934
Watch this light.

18:32.560 --> 18:33.769
Follow it.

18:36.897 --> 18:39.567
- How many fingers?
- Three.

18:40.150 --> 18:42.111
Good. Tell me your name.

18:47.324 --> 18:49.159
I don't know.

18:50.077 --> 18:53.247
He's fine.
Memory loss, like the other one.

19:33.621 --> 19:35.539
Let's open that door.

19:57.603 --> 20:01.190
I want to know who you people are
and what's going on here.

20:04.610 --> 20:05.653
Now!

20:07.947 --> 20:12.076
You and I have the same employer.
We work for the Umbrella Corporation.

20:12.243 --> 20:15.412
The mansion above is an
emergency entrance to the Hive.

20:15.621 --> 20:19.291
You were security operatives
placed there to protect that entrance.

20:20.167 --> 20:21.460
What a bout this?

20:22.419 --> 20:24.296
Your marriage is a fake.

20:24.672 --> 20:27.716
Just your cover to protect
the secrecy of the Hive.

20:28.050 --> 20:29.635
And what is the Hive?

20:30.302 --> 20:31.428
Show them.

20:33.389 --> 20:35.766
Accessing schematic
of the Hive.

20:35.933 --> 20:38.394
Raccoon City,
nearest urban center.

20:38.602 --> 20:42.773
The mansion, where we found you
and gained access to the train...

20:43.190 --> 20:46.402
which, in turn,
brought us to the Hive.

20:47.820 --> 20:50.447
The Hive is located underground...

20:50.614 --> 20:53.367
deep beneath the streets
of Raccoon City.

20:55.244 --> 20:57.872
A secret research facility
owned and operated

20:58.038 --> 20:59.665
by the Umbrella Corporation...

20:59.874 --> 21:04.044
The Hive houses over 500 technicians,
scientists and support staff.

21:04.837 --> 21:07.631
They live and work underground.

21:07.923 --> 21:10.509
Their research is of
the highest importance.

21:10.801 --> 21:12.845
Its nature is classifíed.

21:14.305 --> 21:17.600
Our position on the map
is indicated by heat signature.

21:31.280 --> 21:33.365
Why can't I remember anything?

21:33.866 --> 21:37.411
The Hive has its own defense
mechanisms, all computer-controlled.

21:38.746 --> 21:41.540
A nerve gas was released
into the house.

21:44.793 --> 21:46.503
Primary effect of the gas:

21:46.670 --> 21:49.673
Complete unconsciousness
lasting up to four hours.

21:50.090 --> 21:53.385
Secondary effects can include
acute memory loss.

21:53.844 --> 21:57.389
- For how long?
- Subjective. An hour, day, week.

21:58.057 --> 21:59.850
So, this place was attacked?

22:00.434 --> 22:03.979
I'm afraid things are a little
more complicated than that.

22:04.897 --> 22:07.233
Sir, we've breached the Hive.

22:17.409 --> 22:18.577
J.D.

22:46.564 --> 22:47.940
Got it.

23:00.452 --> 23:02.288
Halon has dissipated.

23:21.557 --> 23:25.185
Easier to work underground,
thinking there's a view.

23:46.540 --> 23:48.751
Looks like we're taking the stairs.

23:59.011 --> 24:00.137
Status.

24:00.721 --> 24:04.141
Red Queen's locked on to us.
She knows we're here.

24:05.476 --> 24:07.102
Who's the Red Queen?

24:07.269 --> 24:09.271
State-of-the-art
artificial intelligence.

24:09.438 --> 24:12.316
The computer
that controls the Hive.

24:25.871 --> 24:27.873
This will slow us down.

24:28.958 --> 24:31.835
Our route to the Queen takes us
straight through these labs.

24:32.253 --> 24:35.297
Rain, J.D.,
see how bad the flooding is.

24:35.839 --> 24:38.050
Kaplan, find an alternate route.

24:41.470 --> 24:43.389
What happened here?

24:47.393 --> 24:49.603
Five hours ago,
Red Queen went homicidal.

24:49.770 --> 24:51.772
Sealed the Hive
and killed everyone here.

24:51.939 --> 24:52.648
Jesus.

24:52.815 --> 24:56.110
When we realized what happened,
we were dispatched to shut her down.

24:56.610 --> 24:59.613
- Why did she do it?
- We don't know.

25:00.656 --> 25:03.200
But outside interference
is a possibility.

25:03.909 --> 25:04.827
Jesus!

25:20.676 --> 25:21.886
You okay?

25:26.640 --> 25:27.683
Here.

25:27.850 --> 25:30.603
- No, I'm fine.
- It's cold in here.

25:40.154 --> 25:40.905
Are you...?

25:43.991 --> 25:46.702
Do you remember anything from...

25:47.286 --> 25:49.038
before this?

25:52.416 --> 25:55.419
No, nothing before the train.

25:57.755 --> 25:58.923
And you?

26:02.843 --> 26:04.053
Nothing.

26:04.386 --> 26:07.181
I found an alternate route
but it will cost us time.

26:07.932 --> 26:12.561
If we double back, cut through
Dining Hall B, we're right on track.

26:28.202 --> 26:31.163
Sir, no go.
The whole level's flooded.

26:31.664 --> 26:32.998
All right,
we're behind schedule.

26:34.291 --> 26:35.626
So let's move it.

26:42.091 --> 26:43.175
Come on.

26:50.599 --> 26:51.934
Poor bastards.

27:38.898 --> 27:39.857
Kaplan?

27:40.024 --> 27:42.902
Dining Hall B.
That's what's on the map.

27:43.944 --> 27:45.613
Maybe you're reading it wrong.

27:46.363 --> 27:48.449
May be the Corporation
keeps secrets here,

27:48.616 --> 27:51.201
something you're not
supposed to see.

27:52.786 --> 27:55.706
J.D., you and Rain keep the prisoner
here and secure the exit.

27:56.373 --> 28:00.878
Halon levels are nonexistent.
I think the system malfunctioned.

28:01.462 --> 28:05.674
There may be survivors. Give me
a search line but keep it tight.

28:09.803 --> 28:10.971
Move it.

29:02.356 --> 29:05.859
- I said keep it tight.
- Sorry.

29:08.028 --> 29:11.198
I'm not sure I want to remember
what went on down here.

29:15.077 --> 29:16.829
I don't blame you.

29:17.621 --> 29:21.166
- What the hell do they keep in these?
- How do I know?

29:47.234 --> 29:48.986
What's taking so long?

29:49.153 --> 29:53.240
Red Queen's defenses are in place.
She's making it difficult.

29:57.953 --> 29:59.121
Let's pack it up.

30:11.967 --> 30:13.719
You. Stay here.

30:46.919 --> 30:50.339
The lights are automated.
Nothing to worry about.

31:09.984 --> 31:11.860
- Transmitter in position.
- Roger.

31:12.278 --> 31:14.113
Running a bypass.

31:33.757 --> 31:35.092
Checkmate.

31:44.560 --> 31:45.561
Move up.

31:50.524 --> 31:52.151
What is that?

31:52.610 --> 31:56.655
That will shut the Queen down.
Delivers a massive electrical charge.

31:56.822 --> 31:58.866
Forces the mainframe to re boot.

32:03.412 --> 32:04.455
Kaplan!

32:08.751 --> 32:12.338
A dormant defense mechanism.
We must've tripped it.

32:12.504 --> 32:14.757
- Put it back to sleep.
- Working on it.

32:18.552 --> 32:20.804
- Open that door.
- I'm trying.

32:20.971 --> 32:23.057
Hold your positions.
Stay calm.

32:23.641 --> 32:24.391
What's that?

32:27.061 --> 32:29.647
- Get them out!
- Something's happening in there.

32:29.813 --> 32:31.273
- Come on.
- Help them!

32:32.191 --> 32:33.525
Down! Get down!

32:35.736 --> 32:38.948
- Something's killing them!
- Don't do this!

32:41.200 --> 32:42.952
Medic! Medic!

32:52.002 --> 32:54.547
- Open the door!
- I'm trying!

32:54.755 --> 32:58.092
You're going into shock.
Stay awake!

32:58.592 --> 32:59.635
Almost there.

32:59.802 --> 33:01.929
It's coming back!

33:02.137 --> 33:03.639
- Open it!
- I'm trying!

33:03.806 --> 33:05.015
Try harder!

33:05.808 --> 33:07.768
It's coming back!

33:16.277 --> 33:16.902
Oh, God!

33:18.195 --> 33:19.572
- Do it!
- Almost there.

33:20.739 --> 33:21.907
Come on!

33:24.618 --> 33:25.953
- Shit.
- Got it.

33:51.520 --> 33:52.938
All right.

33:53.606 --> 33:55.190
Let's do it.

33:56.442 --> 33:59.820
- Do what?
- We have to complete the mission.

34:00.070 --> 34:02.031
No way I'll go down there.

34:03.574 --> 34:05.492
Her defenses are down.

34:05.910 --> 34:07.745
Déja vu, anyone?

35:09.848 --> 35:11.267
Keep going.

35:45.551 --> 35:47.344
Give me a hand.

36:02.693 --> 36:05.154
Get out!
You can't be in here.

36:05.362 --> 36:09.241
Don't listen. She's a holographic
representation of the Red Queen.

36:09.450 --> 36:10.659
Get out!

36:11.118 --> 36:12.703
Modeled after
the programmer's daughter.

36:12.870 --> 36:15.539
She'll deceive us, confuse us.

36:15.706 --> 36:17.208
I wouldn't advise this.

36:17.374 --> 36:20.211
Disabling me will result
in loss of primary power.

36:20.377 --> 36:22.838
She'll say anything to stop us
from shutting her down.

36:23.797 --> 36:25.716
I implore you.

36:26.342 --> 36:28.761
- Implore away.
- Please?

36:30.638 --> 36:31.680
Please?

36:33.849 --> 36:36.393
You're all going to die down here.

37:36.954 --> 37:38.789
That pulse forces
the circuit breaker

37:38.956 --> 37:40.791
to shut down her mainframe
for 30 seconds.

37:41.584 --> 37:43.878
After that, if I don't have
her boards, he can re boot.

37:53.929 --> 37:55.347
They're late.

38:04.565 --> 38:05.900
I'm on it.

38:53.822 --> 38:55.824
J.D., we got a survivor!

38:56.659 --> 38:58.619
We're here to help.

39:00.746 --> 39:02.623
You seem to be in some sort of...

39:06.293 --> 39:07.461
Get off!

39:08.254 --> 39:09.213
Get off of me!

39:11.257 --> 39:13.676
Get her off me
before I stab her ass.

39:17.054 --> 39:18.347
You okay?

39:19.265 --> 39:22.935
She bit me, man.
She took a chunk right out of me.

39:25.187 --> 39:28.857
Stay back.
I'm warning you, stay down!

39:29.024 --> 39:29.984
She's crazy.

39:32.403 --> 39:34.488
Come any closer and I'll fire.

39:36.532 --> 39:37.867
I mean it!

39:40.119 --> 39:41.203
Damn you!

40:01.015 --> 40:04.768
I shot her five times.
How was she still standing?

40:05.311 --> 40:07.062
Bitch isn't standing now.

40:11.692 --> 40:15.446
- What was all the shooting?
- We found a survivor.

40:15.905 --> 40:19.950
- And you shot him?
- She was crazed. She bit me.

40:21.660 --> 40:23.996
She's gone.
She's gone!

40:25.539 --> 40:26.790
Bullshit!

40:27.082 --> 40:29.293
She fell right here
but she's gone!

40:31.587 --> 40:35.841
Look at this.
There's blood, but it's not much.

40:37.635 --> 40:39.386
Looks coagulated.

40:40.012 --> 40:40.971
Yeah.

40:41.972 --> 40:43.557
It's not possi ble.

40:43.766 --> 40:45.309
Why not?

40:46.685 --> 40:49.772
Blood doesn't do that
till after you're dead.

40:50.189 --> 40:51.148
Can we go now?

40:51.315 --> 40:53.901
Not till the rest of
the team get here.

41:00.074 --> 41:01.951
There's no one else coming.

41:02.785 --> 41:05.412
- What the fuck you talking about?
- Wait.

41:06.330 --> 41:07.164
Quiet.

41:44.159 --> 41:46.370
- Fuck!
- Don't come any closer!

41:46.704 --> 41:47.955
They're behind us!

41:48.205 --> 41:49.039
Jesus!

41:52.418 --> 41:53.502
They're everywhere.

41:54.336 --> 41:57.006
They're everywhere.
They're all around us.

42:19.737 --> 42:21.113
I said stay back!

42:30.748 --> 42:32.458
Why aren't they dying?

42:41.217 --> 42:44.011
Watch the tank!
The tank!

42:51.727 --> 42:53.854
- Let's go!
- Hurry up!

42:54.063 --> 42:56.273
- Wait!
- Come on! Move!

42:56.482 --> 42:57.358
Come on!

43:02.196 --> 43:03.197
Move.

43:15.668 --> 43:19.213
I can help you get the virus.
I have security codes...

43:19.380 --> 43:21.757
surveillance plans, the works.

43:39.775 --> 43:40.776
Shit.

43:48.409 --> 43:50.536
- We lost the others.
- Keep moving.

43:59.670 --> 44:01.964
- You waited?
- Didn't know the code.

44:02.506 --> 44:03.507
Come on.

44:03.799 --> 44:05.467
- Shit!
- Come on!

44:19.857 --> 44:21.066
- Hurry up.
- Shit!

44:21.233 --> 44:22.818
- Come on.
- Shit!

44:24.570 --> 44:26.989
- What's taking so long?
- I'm trying!

44:44.089 --> 44:45.174
Come on.

44:48.177 --> 44:51.597
- Move! What's the code?
- Hurry, I'm running out of ammo!

44:51.805 --> 44:53.849
0-43-2... No, fuck!

44:55.017 --> 44:57.144
- What?!
- 0-43...

44:57.311 --> 44:59.563
- What is the code?
- 0-4...

44:59.897 --> 45:02.191
0-3-1...

45:02.358 --> 45:03.984
9-6-5.

45:05.027 --> 45:07.821
- Got it?
- See how easy that was?

45:09.240 --> 45:09.949
Shit!

45:14.537 --> 45:16.038
Grab my hand, man!

45:16.747 --> 45:18.249
Don't let go!

46:19.310 --> 46:22.521
Where are the bodies?
Where did they go? Fuck!

46:26.108 --> 46:28.360
Whatever they are,
there's too many.

46:28.569 --> 46:32.031
Whatever they are?
It's pretty obvious what they are.

46:32.823 --> 46:35.993
La b coats, badges...
Those people used to work here.

46:36.160 --> 46:38.329
All the people
working here are dead.

46:39.413 --> 46:41.624
That isn't stopping them
from walking around.

46:41.916 --> 46:45.211
Where did they come from?
Why didn't we see them on the way in?

46:45.794 --> 46:49.590
When you cut the power, you unlocked
the doors. You let them out.

46:59.850 --> 47:02.186
We're never gonna make it
to the surface.

49:03.891 --> 49:06.352
You are security operatives...

49:06.602 --> 49:08.604
placed there to protect
that entrance.

51:36.001 --> 51:37.253
Lisa.

52:03.988 --> 52:07.992
I've got one in the breech.
And an extra mag.

53:03.339 --> 53:06.842
I can help you get the virus.
I have access to security codes...

53:07.009 --> 53:09.637
surveillance plans, the works.

53:10.054 --> 53:11.263
But?

53:11.680 --> 53:14.183
- But there will be a price.
- Name it

53:21.106 --> 53:23.359
- Who was she?
- My sister.

53:32.535 --> 53:35.412
Corporations like Umbrella...

53:36.163 --> 53:37.998
think they're above the law.

53:38.916 --> 53:40.292
But they're not.

53:44.046 --> 53:48.676
There are hundreds of thousands of us
who think the same all over the world.

53:52.346 --> 53:54.640
Some of us provide information.

53:55.724 --> 53:57.643
Others give their support.

53:59.186 --> 54:01.230
Some take more direct action.

54:02.439 --> 54:03.607
Like you.

54:05.776 --> 54:08.070
If your friends had been
more thorough,

54:08.237 --> 54:10.364
they would've seen
through my false I.D.

54:13.117 --> 54:15.286
Then all the red flags
would've gone off.

54:15.578 --> 54:19.373
Quantico, NSA, ViCAP,
all the rest.

54:20.833 --> 54:24.169
There's no way I could've
infiltrated the Hive.

54:25.296 --> 54:27.047
So you sent your sister.

54:31.260 --> 54:33.429
We needed something concrete,

54:33.596 --> 54:36.265
anything to expose Um brella
to the press.

54:36.724 --> 54:39.435
Proof of the research
going on down here.

54:40.477 --> 54:42.187
What kind of research?

54:42.730 --> 54:44.315
The illegal kind.

54:45.816 --> 54:46.942
Genetic.

54:48.235 --> 54:49.528
Viral.

54:53.449 --> 54:55.117
My sister was going to
smuggle out

54:55.284 --> 54:58.037
a sample of the virus
they were developing.

55:00.539 --> 55:03.000
How was she going to
make it out?

55:04.001 --> 55:08.380
She had a contact within the Hive,
someone I never met.

55:08.797 --> 55:13.302
They had access to security codes,
surveillance, everything she needed.

55:14.136 --> 55:16.055
So why didn't she make it?

55:18.098 --> 55:20.392
Maybe she trusted the wrong person.

55:21.644 --> 55:23.312
Maybe they set her up.

55:24.104 --> 55:26.065
Kept the virus for themselves.

55:28.234 --> 55:32.321
Do you have any idea what the T-virus
would be worth on the open market?

55:33.364 --> 55:34.740
Worth all this?

55:35.074 --> 55:36.408
Yeah.

55:36.951 --> 55:38.327
To someone.

55:46.293 --> 55:48.587
- Don't shoot!
- Close that door!

55:48.754 --> 55:51.215
- They're right behind us!
- Close that door!

55:53.634 --> 55:54.969
Get off!

55:58.806 --> 56:00.015
Son of a bitch!

56:01.100 --> 56:02.309
You okay?

56:02.643 --> 56:03.686
Yeah.

56:04.144 --> 56:07.147
Right behind us.
What about this door?

56:07.523 --> 56:09.191
They're waiting there too.

56:10.234 --> 56:11.569
And that way?

56:12.152 --> 56:15.155
Dead end. There's no way
out of the Queen's chamber.

56:15.739 --> 56:18.659
So we wait.
Someone doesn't hear from you...

56:18.826 --> 56:21.704
they'll send backup or something.
Right?

56:25.541 --> 56:28.127
What? What's wrong?

56:28.794 --> 56:32.798
- We don't have much time.
- Those blast doors we passed...

56:33.215 --> 56:36.719
on the way in from the mansion,
they seal shut in under an hour.

56:38.095 --> 56:40.931
If we're not out by then,
we're not getting out.

56:41.098 --> 56:42.474
What are you talking about?

56:42.641 --> 56:45.477
They can't just bury us
alive down here.

56:48.814 --> 56:52.902
Containing the incident is
the only fail-safe plan they had...

56:53.944 --> 56:56.447
against possible contamination.

56:58.324 --> 57:01.452
And you're telling us this now,
when we're trapped...

57:01.619 --> 57:03.287
half a mile underground?

57:03.454 --> 57:06.040
We have to find a way
out of this room.

57:09.335 --> 57:10.961
What are you doing?

57:14.465 --> 57:17.259
- Where are you taking those?
- I'm turning her back on.

57:17.426 --> 57:20.137
- That's not a good idea.
- She'll know a way out of here.

57:25.726 --> 57:27.436
That homicidal bitch killed my team.

57:27.603 --> 57:31.065
That homicidal bitch may be
our only way out of here.

57:31.232 --> 57:33.150
Considering the way
she's been treated,

57:33.317 --> 57:35.194
I'm sure she's real happy
to help us out.

57:35.361 --> 57:38.572
That circuit breaker you were
talking about. Can you bypass it?

57:38.781 --> 57:40.282
- Yeah?
- So do it.

57:47.081 --> 57:48.958
Circuit breaker's disabled.

57:49.291 --> 57:53.921
This time, if I hit the switch,
she won't shut down. She'll fry.

57:59.635 --> 58:01.887
The charge must've damaged
her boards.

58:02.054 --> 58:03.430
There you are.

58:03.597 --> 58:07.351
Things, I gather,
have gone out of control.

58:07.601 --> 58:10.646
Give me that switch right now.
I'll fry your ass!

58:11.355 --> 58:13.357
I did warn you, didn't I?

58:13.941 --> 58:17.903
- Tell us what's going on down here.
- Research and development.

58:18.070 --> 58:19.572
What a bout the T-virus?

58:19.738 --> 58:22.616
The T-virus was a major
medical breakthrough.

58:22.783 --> 58:24.869
Although it clearly
also possessed...

58:25.119 --> 58:28.205
highly profitable
military applications.

58:28.789 --> 58:30.416
How does it explain
those things out there?

58:30.624 --> 58:33.460
Even in death, the human body
remains active.

58:33.627 --> 58:35.880
Hair and fingernails
continue to grow.

58:36.046 --> 58:38.257
New cells are produced.

58:38.549 --> 58:41.427
And the brain holds
a small electrical charge

58:41.594 --> 58:43.721
that takes months to dissipate.

58:44.680 --> 58:48.976
The T-virus provides a massive jolt,
both to cellular growth...

58:49.184 --> 58:52.187
and to those trace
electrical impulses.

58:52.354 --> 58:56.108
Put quite simply,
it reanimates the body.

58:56.734 --> 58:58.819
It brings the dead back to life?

58:59.111 --> 59:03.532
Not fully. The subjects have
the simplest of motor functions.

59:03.908 --> 59:07.953
Perhaps a little memory.
Virtually no intelligence.

59:08.245 --> 59:13.042
They are driven by the basest of
impulses, the most basic of needs.

59:13.626 --> 59:16.086
- Which is?
- The need to feed.

59:21.467 --> 59:22.801
How do you kill them?

59:22.968 --> 59:25.095
Severing the top of
the spinal column...

59:25.262 --> 59:28.724
or massive trauma to the brain
are the most effective methods.

59:29.600 --> 59:31.518
You mean shoot them
in the head.

59:31.685 --> 59:33.896
Why did you kill
everybody down here?

59:34.313 --> 59:37.691
The T-virus escaped
into the air conditioning system.

59:38.108 --> 59:41.403
And an uncontrolled pattern
of infection began.

59:41.695 --> 59:43.364
The virus is protean,

59:43.531 --> 59:46.909
changing from liquid to airborne
to blood transmission...

59:47.326 --> 59:51.956
depending on its environment
It's almost impossible to kill.

59:52.248 --> 59:54.792
I couldn't allow it to escape
from the Hive.

59:55.626 --> 59:58.045
So, I took steps.

59:59.046 --> 01:00:01.465
- Steps?
- You must understand...

01:00:01.632 --> 01:00:05.803
those who become infected,
I can't allow you to leave.

01:00:06.178 --> 01:00:08.430
- We're not infected.
- Just one bite...

01:00:08.597 --> 01:00:11.850
one scratch from these creatures
is sufficient...

01:00:12.351 --> 01:00:14.770
and then you become one of them.

01:00:17.022 --> 01:00:21.235
A check of my systems indicates
my main drive circuit breaker...

01:00:21.402 --> 01:00:23.112
has been disabled.

01:00:23.445 --> 01:00:25.322
May I ask why?

01:00:25.531 --> 01:00:28.117
Insurance.
We need a way out of here.

01:00:28.325 --> 01:00:30.744
If you refuse to help,
we flip the switch.

01:00:31.412 --> 01:00:32.621
Understand?

01:00:43.716 --> 01:00:45.050
After you.

01:00:54.602 --> 01:00:56.395
What the hell is this place?

01:00:56.562 --> 01:00:57.855
The utility tunnels.

01:00:58.022 --> 01:01:01.066
They run underneath the Hive
for water, gas and power lines.

01:01:14.622 --> 01:01:16.916
- Been in here before.
- Keep moving!

01:01:17.082 --> 01:01:19.960
- Going round in circles.
- This is the route the computer gave.

01:01:20.127 --> 01:01:22.213
- I don't know why you listen to her.
- Enough!

01:01:22.379 --> 01:01:24.089
We have no choice
but to keep moving

01:01:24.256 --> 01:01:25.799
because those things
are behind us, got it?

01:01:32.723 --> 01:01:34.767
That mesh won't hold.
Keep moving.

01:01:38.604 --> 01:01:39.438
Jesus Christ!

01:01:39.605 --> 01:01:41.815
- Hold it!
- There's too many of them!

01:01:45.069 --> 01:01:46.028
Fuck!

01:01:59.375 --> 01:02:01.544
Up on the pipes.
Up on the pipes!

01:02:02.711 --> 01:02:04.505
Quickly, everyone, up on the pipes!

01:02:04.672 --> 01:02:06.799
- Let's go!
- Come on, there's a way up!

01:02:07.132 --> 01:02:08.759
Keep them back!

01:02:10.594 --> 01:02:12.221
Go on up, move it!

01:02:18.644 --> 01:02:19.853
Look out!

01:02:27.570 --> 01:02:29.864
Get over here.
There's too many of them!

01:02:30.948 --> 01:02:32.241
Go, go, go!

01:02:32.575 --> 01:02:33.701
Go on!

01:02:35.911 --> 01:02:37.621
I can manage!

01:02:39.123 --> 01:02:40.124
Go!

01:02:57.641 --> 01:02:58.726
JD?

01:03:24.210 --> 01:03:25.252
What?

01:03:25.669 --> 01:03:28.047
We have to do something
a bout your wounds.

01:03:29.256 --> 01:03:30.549
I'm fine.

01:03:32.468 --> 01:03:33.928
I said I'm fine.

01:03:41.435 --> 01:03:43.187
You like that, don't you?

01:03:45.397 --> 01:03:47.399
You like the way it tastes,
don't you?

01:03:49.944 --> 01:03:51.737
Like the taste of that?

01:03:59.912 --> 01:04:01.413
She was right.

01:04:04.750 --> 01:04:07.336
- We're all going to die down here.
- No.

01:04:07.503 --> 01:04:09.046
We're getting out.

01:04:09.964 --> 01:04:11.465
All of us.

01:04:55.259 --> 01:04:56.677
You okay?

01:05:13.194 --> 01:05:14.195
God!

01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:23.078
Get away!

01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:26.290
- Hold on!
- Come on!

01:05:38.469 --> 01:05:39.637
Help him.

01:05:40.554 --> 01:05:42.890
- I can't.
- What are you waiting for?

01:05:43.265 --> 01:05:44.808
I can't focus.

01:05:48.479 --> 01:05:49.939
I can't see!

01:05:55.361 --> 01:05:57.947
- Go up!
- Clim b up there!

01:05:59.031 --> 01:06:00.449
You gotta keep going!

01:06:00.741 --> 01:06:02.576
- Come on!
- Go!

01:06:02.743 --> 01:06:05.746
- You can do it! Move!
- You got it!

01:06:08.165 --> 01:06:11.085
- Stay there.
- We'll get you.

01:06:11.252 --> 01:06:14.838
We need to cut this wire and throw it
to him. Then we'll get him.

01:06:15.297 --> 01:06:16.382
Hold on.

01:06:22.721 --> 01:06:23.889
That's lucky.

01:06:27.393 --> 01:06:28.936
I want you to go.

01:06:34.191 --> 01:06:36.527
- I'm not leaving you.
- Yes, you are.

01:06:37.945 --> 01:06:39.780
You can't kill all of them.

01:06:41.115 --> 01:06:43.033
I'm not going anywhere.

01:06:43.993 --> 01:06:46.120
I want you to go, now!

01:06:46.787 --> 01:06:48.998
Please, just do it.

01:06:51.458 --> 01:06:53.210
Just do it now!

01:06:53.711 --> 01:06:54.628
Please!

01:06:55.921 --> 01:06:57.590
Go!

01:07:25.534 --> 01:07:27.828
You'll have to work
for your meal!

01:08:00.152 --> 01:08:01.445
Come on.

01:08:10.704 --> 01:08:13.541
Give me your arm, okay?
Over my shoulder.

01:08:13.791 --> 01:08:15.876
Ready?
Here we go.

01:08:57.585 --> 01:08:59.377
When I get out of here...

01:09:00.921 --> 01:09:02.756
I think I'll get laid.

01:09:04.091 --> 01:09:06.385
You might want to clean up first.

01:09:15.144 --> 01:09:16.395
Wait.

01:09:22.193 --> 01:09:23.319
Are you okay?

01:10:10.366 --> 01:10:12.493
Blue for the virus,
green forthe antivirus.

01:10:13.827 --> 01:10:16.539
Blue for the virus,
green forthe antivirus.

01:10:18.290 --> 01:10:20.709
- There's a cure.
- What are you talking a bout?

01:10:21.460 --> 01:10:22.920
There's a cure.

01:10:24.672 --> 01:10:26.549
The process can be reversed.

01:10:28.175 --> 01:10:30.219
There's a cure!
You'll be okay.

01:10:32.471 --> 01:10:34.390
I was beginning to worry.

01:10:42.439 --> 01:10:44.775
This is where they kept
the T-virus.

01:10:46.569 --> 01:10:48.487
How do you know all this?

01:10:51.490 --> 01:10:53.492
Because I was going to steal it.

01:10:56.412 --> 01:10:58.080
I was your sister's contact.

01:11:00.749 --> 01:11:02.585
- You betrayed her.
- I don't know.

01:11:02.751 --> 01:11:04.795
- You caused all this.
- I can't remem ber.

01:11:06.171 --> 01:11:09.216
- The truth.
- I don't remember the truth.

01:11:44.043 --> 01:11:45.586
I don't understand.

01:11:48.714 --> 01:11:50.049
It's gone.

01:11:50.716 --> 01:11:52.468
It's gone. It's not there.

01:11:54.011 --> 01:11:55.304
I can't.

01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:58.682
I just can't. It's over.

01:12:07.816 --> 01:12:11.278
I can help you get the virus.
I have access to security codes...

01:12:11.445 --> 01:12:13.614
surveillance plans, the works.

01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:15.908
But there's a price.

01:12:17.826 --> 01:12:19.119
Name it

01:12:19.328 --> 01:12:23.666
You have to guarantee me that
you'll bring this corporation down.

01:12:31.924 --> 01:12:33.884
Today all your dreams
come true...

01:12:42.017 --> 01:12:42.768
Spence?

01:12:44.311 --> 01:12:45.354
Spence?

01:13:03.163 --> 01:13:04.373
Thank you!

01:13:15.259 --> 01:13:15.926
Spence?

01:13:41.660 --> 01:13:43.579
We can still make it out of here.

01:13:44.163 --> 01:13:45.497
Come with me.

01:13:47.541 --> 01:13:50.211
We can have everything
we've ever wanted.

01:13:50.878 --> 01:13:52.630
Money's out there waiting.

01:13:53.464 --> 01:13:56.008
You wouldn't believe how much.

01:13:56.592 --> 01:13:59.887
Is that how you thought
all my dreams would come true?

01:14:01.722 --> 01:14:02.806
Please.

01:14:03.057 --> 01:14:04.975
I wouldn't want to shoot you.

01:14:05.643 --> 01:14:07.603
Might need the bullets.

01:14:09.813 --> 01:14:11.148
Back off!

01:14:16.195 --> 01:14:18.197
I won't take any part in this.

01:14:18.489 --> 01:14:22.576
Okay, but you can't just
wash your hands of this.

01:14:23.536 --> 01:14:26.247
We work for the same company.
You knew what they did.

01:14:26.413 --> 01:14:28.499
I was trying to stop them.

01:14:29.583 --> 01:14:31.835
You really believe that...

01:14:33.587 --> 01:14:36.507
people like him will ever
change anything?

01:14:39.969 --> 01:14:41.971
Nothing ever...

01:14:42.513 --> 01:14:43.639
changes.

01:14:44.515 --> 01:14:45.683
Where...

01:14:46.016 --> 01:14:47.434
Where is...

01:14:48.727 --> 01:14:50.020
the antivirus?

01:14:50.646 --> 01:14:51.939
It's on the train...

01:14:53.399 --> 01:14:54.984
where you found me.

01:14:57.444 --> 01:15:00.030
Couldn't have been standing
more than three feet from it.

01:15:01.949 --> 01:15:03.868
I so nearly made it out.

01:15:06.328 --> 01:15:08.747
I didn't realize that
bitch of a computer...

01:15:08.914 --> 01:15:11.208
had defense systems outside the Hive.

01:15:13.252 --> 01:15:14.503
In or out?

01:15:16.297 --> 01:15:17.298
In?

01:15:17.590 --> 01:15:18.841
Or out?

01:15:19.592 --> 01:15:21.468
I don't know what we had.

01:15:22.303 --> 01:15:23.637
But it's over.

01:15:30.519 --> 01:15:31.604
Back...

01:15:33.689 --> 01:15:35.316
the fuck off!

01:15:46.994 --> 01:15:48.913
I'm missing you already.

01:15:58.297 --> 01:16:00.299
Your boyfriend's a real asshole.

01:16:00.883 --> 01:16:03.344
He shot the locking mechanism out.

01:16:04.178 --> 01:16:07.514
I can't believe that son of a bitch
is going to get away with this.

01:16:07.890 --> 01:16:09.475
I don't think so.

01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:15.356
I've been a bad, bad girl.

01:17:15.499 --> 01:17:16.917
Oh, my God.

01:17:32.266 --> 01:17:34.602
What the fuck is that?

01:17:35.019 --> 01:17:37.396
One of the Hive's
early experiments.

01:17:37.605 --> 01:17:41.483
Produced by injecting the virus
directly into living tissue.

01:17:41.859 --> 01:17:44.153
The results were unstable.

01:17:44.862 --> 01:17:47.114
Now that it has fed on fresh DNA...

01:17:47.281 --> 01:17:48.657
it will mutate...

01:17:56.165 --> 01:17:59.293
becoming a stronger,
faster hunter.

01:17:59.919 --> 01:18:00.836
Great.

01:18:02.129 --> 01:18:04.715
If you knew it was loose,
why didn't you warn us?

01:18:06.050 --> 01:18:07.968
Because she was saving it.

01:18:08.469 --> 01:18:11.305
For us.
Isn't that right?

01:18:11.513 --> 01:18:14.642
I didn't think any of you
would make it this far.

01:18:14.975 --> 01:18:16.352
Not without infection.

01:18:16.810 --> 01:18:19.855
Why didn't you tell us
about the antivirus?

01:18:20.356 --> 01:18:24.235
This long after infection,
there's no guarantee it would work.

01:18:26.153 --> 01:18:27.821
But there's a chance.

01:18:28.822 --> 01:18:29.823
Right?

01:18:29.990 --> 01:18:32.159
I don't deal in chance.

01:18:40.209 --> 01:18:41.460
Fuck it.

01:18:52.930 --> 01:18:54.557
No pressure, guys.

01:18:54.765 --> 01:18:57.726
You require
the four-digit access code.

01:18:57.893 --> 01:19:02.815
I can give you the code. But fírst,
you must do something for me.

01:19:03.023 --> 01:19:04.191
What do you want?

01:19:04.358 --> 01:19:09.238
One of your group is infected.
I require her life for the code.

01:19:09.446 --> 01:19:12.908
The antivirus is right there
on the platform!

01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:16.787
I'm sorry,
but it's a risk I cannot take.

01:19:20.457 --> 01:19:22.835
She's right. It's the only way.

01:19:23.544 --> 01:19:25.421
You'll have to kill me.

01:19:28.757 --> 01:19:31.385
Otherwise,
we all die down here.

01:19:38.809 --> 01:19:42.229
The glass is reinforced,
but it won't hold forever.

01:19:46.901 --> 01:19:48.152
Do it.

01:19:48.569 --> 01:19:50.446
- Get up.
- Just do it.

01:19:50.613 --> 01:19:52.156
- Please.
- Do it!

01:19:52.323 --> 01:19:53.949
You don't have long to decide.

01:19:54.116 --> 01:19:57.578
- You have no choice.
- Kill her now!

01:19:57.745 --> 01:19:59.914
- Get off!
- You don't have any choice.

01:20:00.414 --> 01:20:02.208
- Just do it now!
- I can't!

01:20:02.374 --> 01:20:04.543
- Kill her now. Do it.
- Please.

01:20:04.835 --> 01:20:07.796
- Kill her. Kill her now!
- Just do it.

01:20:10.925 --> 01:20:11.926
Kill her!

01:20:39.411 --> 01:20:40.120
Kap?

01:20:42.164 --> 01:20:45.167
The bitch wouldn't open the door,
so I had to fry her.

01:20:47.670 --> 01:20:48.546
Move!

01:20:56.929 --> 01:20:58.681
What the fuck was that?

01:20:58.973 --> 01:21:00.808
It's a long story.

01:21:20.286 --> 01:21:21.620
Start it up.

01:21:22.580 --> 01:21:23.998
I'll get the virus.

01:22:00.701 --> 01:22:02.453
I'm missing you already.

01:22:07.875 --> 01:22:09.627
We're in business.

01:22:10.878 --> 01:22:12.171
Full power!

01:22:12.421 --> 01:22:13.672
We're leaving!

01:22:31.190 --> 01:22:34.068
I don't want to be
one of those things...

01:22:36.862 --> 01:22:40.199
walking around without a soul.

01:22:41.242 --> 01:22:42.826
You won't.

01:22:43.911 --> 01:22:45.746
When the time comes...

01:22:47.039 --> 01:22:48.999
you'll take care of it.

01:22:51.418 --> 01:22:53.504
No one else is going to die.

01:23:05.391 --> 01:23:06.433
Here.

01:23:16.652 --> 01:23:17.736
Rain.

01:23:20.239 --> 01:23:21.407
Rain.

01:23:24.410 --> 01:23:25.369
Rain.

01:24:10.456 --> 01:24:11.999
I'm not dead yet.

01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:15.669
I think I'll have that back.

01:24:19.089 --> 01:24:21.258
I could kiss you, you bitch.

01:24:26.013 --> 01:24:27.515
What the hell's going
on back there?

01:24:39.652 --> 01:24:43.197
- Get us the fuck out of here.
- Any faster, we'll come off the rails.

01:26:00.316 --> 01:26:02.109
Open the doors!

01:26:25.341 --> 01:26:28.260
Open the doors!
Now!

01:28:13.449 --> 01:28:15.784
I failed all of them.

01:28:18.746 --> 01:28:20.039
I failed.

01:28:21.874 --> 01:28:25.336
Listen to me. There is
nothing else you could've done.

01:28:26.212 --> 01:28:28.464
The Corporation's guilty here,
not you.

01:28:29.256 --> 01:28:31.175
And we finally have the proof.

01:28:31.634 --> 01:28:33.761
And that way,
Umbrella can't get...

01:28:34.762 --> 01:28:36.055
away with this.

01:28:37.515 --> 01:28:39.350
I mean, we can...

01:28:39.934 --> 01:28:41.101
What is it?

01:28:43.979 --> 01:28:47.733
You're infected, but you'll be okay.
I'm not losing you.

01:28:56.408 --> 01:28:59.537
- Help!
- Help him! What are you doing?

01:29:14.176 --> 01:29:15.469
He's mutating.

01:29:17.513 --> 01:29:19.598
I want him in the Nemesis Program.

01:29:24.270 --> 01:29:25.187
Get off!

01:29:26.355 --> 01:29:27.648
What's happening?

01:29:53.382 --> 01:29:55.759
I want her quarantined.
Close observation...

01:29:55.926 --> 01:29:57.845
and a full series of blood tests.

01:29:59.930 --> 01:30:01.849
Let's see if she's infected.

01:30:02.558 --> 01:30:04.852
