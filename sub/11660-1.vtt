(serene music playing)

00:55.867 --> 00:57.633
Girls. Girls, guess what? I've got--

00:57.700 --> 00:59.700
Wait a minute!

00:59.767 --> 01:02.100
Why do you always say,
"girls, girls"?

01:02.166 --> 01:04.800
Do you see Molly Ringwald
sitting here?

01:06.600 --> 01:08.533
You're awfully cranky today.

01:08.600 --> 01:09.567
Well, forgive me.

01:09.633 --> 01:13.266
My arthritis is bothering me,
my social security check was late,

01:13.333 --> 01:16.900
and I realized today I haven't
showered with a man in 22 years.

01:18.633 --> 01:22.133
Mom, pop's been dead 27 years.

01:22.200 --> 01:23.533
What's your point?

01:25.500 --> 01:26.900
What are you saying?

01:26.967 --> 01:28.300
Isn't it obvious, Dorothy?

01:28.367 --> 01:31.200
She showered with a dead man
for five years.

01:32.900 --> 01:34.233
Rose, what did you want?

01:34.300 --> 01:38.166
I got two tickets to the hottest
Norwegian musical in town.

01:38.233 --> 01:41.266
It's tempting,
but I have other plans.

01:41.333 --> 01:43.000
You have a date?

01:45.533 --> 01:47.667
Never say that while I'm eating.

01:48.667 --> 01:52.667
I'm teaching history
for an adult education program.

01:52.734 --> 01:55.433
It's for people who never
got their high school diplomas.

01:55.500 --> 01:56.500
What else do they teach?

01:56.567 --> 01:58.467
The usual high school subjects.

01:58.533 --> 02:02.133
You mean the three R's, reading,
writing, and rooster inseminating?

02:04.467 --> 02:08.066
No. We just teach
the first two R's, Rose.

02:08.133 --> 02:11.166
You're sending people
into the world

02:11.233 --> 02:14.100
who don't know you can
get a nasty rooster bite

02:14.166 --> 02:16.100
if you don't warm
your hands up first.

02:18.834 --> 02:21.233
Girls, is this dress me?

02:21.300 --> 02:25.934
It's too tight, it's too short,
and shows too much cleavage.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.867
Yes, Blanche, it's you.

02:29.934 --> 02:32.033
Another date with your mystery man?

02:32.100 --> 02:33.967
He's no mystery man.

02:34.033 --> 02:36.500
You've dated him four times.

02:36.567 --> 02:38.500
We don't know
anything about him.

02:38.567 --> 02:40.934
There is one little thing.

02:41.000 --> 02:41.867
(doorbell rings)

02:41.934 --> 02:44.233
That must be him.
Get the door, please.

02:47.266 --> 02:48.166
Hello.

02:48.233 --> 02:50.834
Hello. We thought
you were Blanche's date,

02:50.900 --> 02:52.533
but you're way too old.

02:53.700 --> 02:55.400
<i>Hola,</i> Blanche!

02:55.467 --> 02:58.300
Hello, sweetheart.
Come in.

02:58.367 --> 03:00.367
I want you to meet
all my friends.

03:00.433 --> 03:03.033
Please forgive me.
It wasn't my fault.

03:03.100 --> 03:05.600
My cousins have been marrying
each other for generations.

03:09.200 --> 03:13.934
-Everybody, this is Fidel Santiago.
-How do you do?

03:14.000 --> 03:15.400
It is always a pleasure

03:15.467 --> 03:18.233
to meet beautiful ladies
such as yourselves.

03:18.734 --> 03:21.633
With that accent,
you could almost buy it.

03:22.133 --> 03:24.667
And you must be Sophia.

03:24.734 --> 03:26.667
Your face looks awfully familiar.

03:26.734 --> 03:29.734
Was your picture ever
on a cigar box?

03:29.800 --> 03:30.900
Ma...

03:30.967 --> 03:33.734
She's right.
That was my father.

03:33.800 --> 03:36.066
May we continue, commandant?

03:37.600 --> 03:41.367
My family owned the largest tobacco
plantation in Cuba.

03:41.433 --> 03:43.066
At one time,

03:43.133 --> 03:47.166
I was the most famous Fidel
in the entire country

03:47.233 --> 03:50.567
until you-know-who
showed up.

03:50.633 --> 03:52.233
Who?

03:54.266 --> 03:56.633
Rex the wonder horse,
Rose.

03:56.700 --> 03:59.500
How did you know about
Santiago cigars?

03:59.567 --> 04:03.166
My husband was a fan,
not of the cigars, the boxes.

04:03.233 --> 04:05.934
We kept all our fine cutlery in one.

04:06.433 --> 04:07.700
Blanche was right.

04:07.767 --> 04:10.100
She said you were incorrigible.

04:10.166 --> 04:12.967
I guess I deserve it.
I always say she's a cheap slut.

04:16.600 --> 04:18.100
Maybe we'd better be going.

04:18.166 --> 04:21.233
Yes. It was a pleasure
meeting you all.

04:21.300 --> 04:22.500
Good night.

04:23.867 --> 04:27.133
Well,
I guess that solves the mystery.

04:27.200 --> 04:30.300
Blanche was dating someone
that long in the tooth?

04:30.367 --> 04:31.667
I thought his teeth were nice.

04:31.734 --> 04:34.200
What I couldn't believe
was how old he was.

04:35.767 --> 04:38.800
Sometimes I really
cannot believe my ears.

04:38.867 --> 04:41.867
I know. I should have taped them
back when you were 7.

04:44.166 --> 04:48.500
(serene music playing)

04:48.567 --> 04:51.700
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Please take your seats.

04:55.266 --> 04:56.567
Jorge Vega?

04:57.900 --> 04:59.233
Michael Fetchick?

05:00.200 --> 05:01.633
Jim Shu.

05:02.533 --> 05:05.066
Jim Shu?

05:05.133 --> 05:08.133
Oh, I get it.
Gym shoe. Very funny.

05:09.166 --> 05:09.900
Excuse me.

05:09.967 --> 05:11.967
I am Jim Shu.

05:17.100 --> 05:18.667
I'm terribly sorry.

05:18.734 --> 05:21.767
I thought you were pulling my leg.

05:21.834 --> 05:25.033
I don't think I could drink
that much sake.

05:25.100 --> 05:26.400
Sit down, Shu.

05:29.934 --> 05:32.467
Maria Gianelli?

05:32.533 --> 05:37.367
Rose Nyl... Rose Ny...?

05:37.433 --> 05:40.367
Rose, what are you doing here?

05:40.433 --> 05:42.333
I have a confession to make.

05:42.400 --> 05:46.033
I slipped through the cracks
of the St. Olaf school system.

05:46.100 --> 05:47.333
That's very hard to believe.

05:47.400 --> 05:51.567
I've seen you almost complete
<i>TV Guide</i> crossword puzzles.

05:51.633 --> 05:54.667
You're looking at a woman
without a sheepskin.

05:54.734 --> 05:57.233
I've got an extra in my wallet
I could give you.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.233
No, thanks. I'd rather earn it.

06:07.667 --> 06:09.667
Meet you at Benihana after class?

06:11.734 --> 06:13.667
Rose... Rose!

06:15.800 --> 06:18.967
You never graduated
from high school?

06:19.033 --> 06:20.533
-Not officially.
-I can't--

06:20.600 --> 06:22.266
Three weeks before graduation,

06:22.333 --> 06:26.066
I was asked to be in the kissing
booth at the founder's day fair.

06:26.133 --> 06:30.400
Unfortunately,
the first boy I kissed had mono.

06:30.467 --> 06:34.100
That afternoon I passed it along
to 50 young men...

06:36.066 --> 06:40.633
and one very confused female P.E.
Teacher who smelled of old spice.

06:42.600 --> 06:44.934
We slept day and night
for the next six months.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.834
When I finally woke up,
I'd missed my graduation

06:47.900 --> 06:50.233
and the integration
of major league baseball.

06:51.633 --> 06:53.500
Rose, I'm very sorry,

06:53.567 --> 06:56.100
but, honey,
you cannot stay in this class.

06:56.166 --> 06:57.400
Oh, please, Dorothy.

06:57.467 --> 07:00.934
I've dreamt of getting
a diploma for years,

07:00.967 --> 07:03.100
but I never had the courage
to do it.

07:03.166 --> 07:04.734
Now with you teaching,

07:04.800 --> 07:07.500
I finally feel comfortable enough
to give it a try.

07:08.600 --> 07:12.000
Oh, all right, all right.
You can stay.

07:12.066 --> 07:13.200
Thank you.

07:17.066 --> 07:20.667
All right, everybody,
if you'll turn to page five,

07:20.734 --> 07:22.934
-yes, Rose?
-Aren't you forgetting something?

07:23.000 --> 07:23.767
What?

07:26.300 --> 07:31.834
I pledge allegiance to the flag
of the United States of America

07:31.900 --> 07:35.867
and to the republic for
which it stands, one nation...

07:35.934 --> 07:39.834
(mellow music playing)

07:40.333 --> 07:42.233
Hi, Dorothy. What are you doing?

07:42.300 --> 07:44.033
I'm grading the history test.

07:44.100 --> 07:45.233
How did I do?

07:45.300 --> 07:46.500
You'll find out in class tomorrow.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.066
-Can you give me a hint?
-No.

07:51.066 --> 07:52.934
Did I do better than Boris Yushenko?

07:53.000 --> 07:57.467
Oh, Rose, Boris Yushenko
doesn't speak a word of English.

07:57.533 --> 08:01.066
And he was hit in the forward
with a mortar during World War two.

08:02.467 --> 08:04.300
-Did I do better than him?
-No.

08:05.967 --> 08:07.166
I'm a failure.

08:07.233 --> 08:08.333
Rose, you are not.

08:08.400 --> 08:09.934
Now, come on,
you are doing very well

08:10.000 --> 08:12.400
in every subject except history.

08:12.467 --> 08:14.333
Well, I'm not surprised.

08:14.400 --> 08:16.467
It's all because of
my high school history teacher

08:16.533 --> 08:19.500
Mr. Shticklemeyer.
He was a Nazi.

08:19.567 --> 08:21.433
Oh, come on, now.

08:21.500 --> 08:23.800
Rose, a lot of students don't
like their teachers--

08:23.867 --> 08:25.900
No, I mean it.

08:25.967 --> 08:27.734
He was part of a nefarious plot

08:27.800 --> 08:30.066
by the Germans
to teach misinformation

08:30.133 --> 08:32.900
so America's youth
would be really stupid

08:32.967 --> 08:34.633
when the Germans invaded.

08:36.367 --> 08:39.266
St. Olaf was the first town
chosen for their experiment.

08:40.967 --> 08:43.967
I guess they figured
they had a leg up there.

08:44.033 --> 08:46.633
His orders came
right from the top.

08:46.700 --> 08:47.900
You mean, Hitler?

08:47.967 --> 08:49.233
Who's Hitler?

08:52.500 --> 08:55.533
You are bad at history.

08:56.033 --> 08:58.767
Girls, I'm just beside myself.

08:58.834 --> 09:00.367
Fidel's seeing another woman.

09:00.433 --> 09:02.233
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

09:02.300 --> 09:03.867
We were seeing each other
constantly.

09:03.934 --> 09:06.133
Now I see him twice a week.

09:06.200 --> 09:09.166
What else could it be?

09:09.233 --> 09:11.300
Maybe he paints,
like Red Skelton.

09:13.100 --> 09:15.300
Rose, would you please hand me
my grade book?

09:15.367 --> 09:17.233
-Sure.
-Thank you.

09:24.200 --> 09:27.900
-You were saying, Blanche?
-I'm heartbroken.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.266
I've never cared for a man
as much as Fidel Santadomingo.

09:31.333 --> 09:33.433
-Santiago.
-Oh, whatever.

09:35.900 --> 09:38.166
The point is he's rich,
he's handsome,

09:38.233 --> 09:41.533
and we're made for each other,
even if I don't speak Mexican.

09:41.600 --> 09:42.500
Spanish.

09:42.567 --> 09:44.800
Whatever.

09:44.867 --> 09:46.266
I don't know what
I'm going to do.

09:46.333 --> 09:48.400
Calm down, Blanche.

09:48.467 --> 09:51.000
There's probably a very
logical explanation.

09:52.100 --> 09:54.500
You know,
you're probably right.

09:54.567 --> 09:57.433
Why would Fidel
want another woman?

09:57.500 --> 10:02.467
After all, he's dipped his toes
in the lake known as Blanche.

10:07.200 --> 10:09.633
That wasn't stupid enough
to deserve a hit?

10:16.500 --> 10:20.700
You know what I'm going to do?
Put your hands down, Rose.

10:20.767 --> 10:23.734
We've all had a bad day.

10:23.800 --> 10:26.133
Let's all go out for dinner.
It's on me.

10:26.200 --> 10:28.834
-That sounds great!
-I'll get my purse.

10:28.900 --> 10:31.600
Dinner out with the girls!

10:31.667 --> 10:33.133
Let's really get crazy.

10:33.200 --> 10:36.767
We'll eat Chinese and use forks.

10:36.834 --> 10:37.934
I know, I know.

10:38.033 --> 10:39.600
We'll pretend
it's one of our birthdays

10:39.667 --> 10:41.233
and screw them out of a cake.

10:43.033 --> 10:46.033
If I wasn't going,
I'd really be jealous of me.

10:46.100 --> 10:48.066
But I am going,
so that's all irrelevant--

10:48.133 --> 10:52.066
Did I hit you too hard before?

10:52.133 --> 10:53.266
No, not at all.

10:53.333 --> 10:56.533
I'm trying a new hairspray,
and it absorbs most of the impact.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.500
(serene music playing)

11:04.367 --> 11:06.333
-Dinner was delicious, Dorothy.
-My pleasure.

11:06.400 --> 11:08.133
I really enjoyed it too.

11:08.200 --> 11:12.166
I forgot all about
old what's-his-name.

11:12.233 --> 11:13.100
Fidel.

11:13.166 --> 11:15.033
Honey, I know his name.

11:15.100 --> 11:16.333
No, there he is,

11:16.400 --> 11:20.200
and he has his arms around
another woman.

11:20.266 --> 11:23.967
Fidel Santiago!
My papers are in order!

11:24.033 --> 11:25.533
Oh, hello, Blanche.

11:25.600 --> 11:27.700
What in hell is going on here?

11:27.767 --> 11:30.033
-Blanche!
-How can you be so deceitful?

11:30.100 --> 11:33.500
Is she younger, more attractive,
more desirable?

11:33.567 --> 11:35.433
You got two out of three,
Blanche.

11:42.400 --> 11:44.934
Sophia, what is going on?

11:45.033 --> 11:49.400
I've got what it takes,
and he knows how to use it.

11:50.800 --> 11:53.300
I think I'm going to lose my lunch.

11:53.367 --> 11:56.667
-Blanche, listen--
-Don't sugarcoat it for her.

11:56.734 --> 11:58.500
We happen to be an item.

11:58.567 --> 12:01.567
I'm wearing
his medic-alert bracelet.

12:01.633 --> 12:03.333
When did this start?

12:03.400 --> 12:05.633
I've been allergic
to penicillin since--

12:05.700 --> 12:07.734
Oh, not that.

12:07.800 --> 12:10.133
I mean this sick relationship.

12:10.200 --> 12:11.500
<i>Por favor.</i>

12:11.567 --> 12:12.834
Let me explain.

12:12.900 --> 12:15.600
I still care for you deeply.

12:15.667 --> 12:17.934
I did not mean
for this to happen.

12:18.033 --> 12:19.734
When I'd pick you up,

12:19.800 --> 12:23.166
I'd always talk to Sophia
while I was waiting.

12:23.233 --> 12:25.967
To my delight,
I found her to be very--

12:26.033 --> 12:27.100
Hot.

12:28.266 --> 12:30.200
Interesting.

12:30.266 --> 12:35.133
Look, ladies, I am so glad
this is all out in the open.

12:35.200 --> 12:37.166
You are both wonderful women,

12:37.233 --> 12:40.367
and I want to continue
seeing both of you.

12:40.433 --> 12:43.700
Of course, that's a decision
you'll have to make.

12:43.767 --> 12:45.367
If you'll excuse me,

12:45.433 --> 12:48.934
it's time for me to change into
my third linen suit of the day.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.767
In this heat,
I go through them like Kleenex.

12:54.800 --> 12:55.600
Oh!

12:55.667 --> 12:57.333
Of all the nerve!

12:57.400 --> 12:59.867
How could he think
I'd continue seeing him?

12:59.934 --> 13:02.734
Blanche Devereaux
has never shared a man.

13:02.800 --> 13:04.100
Or a pizza.

13:05.934 --> 13:09.266
What does that mean,
you wrinkled old crow?

13:09.333 --> 13:12.400
It means Fidel's interested
in more than just a cheap thrill.

13:12.467 --> 13:13.967
He also wants a mind.

13:14.033 --> 13:15.033
Oh, yeah?

13:15.100 --> 13:18.533
-We'll see about that.
-You're on, baby.

13:18.600 --> 13:21.900
(retro music playing)

13:25.200 --> 13:29.633
Fidel, stop. Even surgical stockings
only have so much elastic.

13:31.033 --> 13:35.033
Hello. I thought you two
would be asleep by now.

13:38.066 --> 13:40.100
Girls, this nightgown is so sheer,

13:40.166 --> 13:42.166
I believe you can
see right through it.

13:43.367 --> 13:45.333
Oh! Hello, Fidel.

13:45.400 --> 13:47.500
Hello, Blanche. How are you?

13:47.567 --> 13:49.800
You don't have cataracts.
You tell me.

13:53.767 --> 13:56.066
Beat it, you 50-year-old mattress.

13:58.033 --> 14:01.934
Oh! Why, you...
you miserable old...

14:02.000 --> 14:04.500
Blanche, you know the rules.

14:04.567 --> 14:07.467
When one's out with Fidel,
the other doesn't interfere.

14:08.500 --> 14:10.367
My apologies.

14:10.433 --> 14:11.834
Now, if you'll excuse me,

14:11.900 --> 14:16.000
I'll take a long, hot, steamy bath

14:16.066 --> 14:21.800
with just enough water
to barely cover my perky bosoms.

14:24.934 --> 14:27.033
You're only going to sit
in an inch of water?

14:29.834 --> 14:32.633
Oh, that does it!
That does it!

14:32.700 --> 14:35.734
-Let me at her!
-No! No! No!

14:35.800 --> 14:37.200
Ladies! Ladies!

14:37.266 --> 14:40.633
Let us behave
in a more civilized manner.

14:41.734 --> 14:43.000
You're right.

14:43.066 --> 14:44.700
I apologize, Fidel.

14:44.767 --> 14:46.033
So do I.

14:46.100 --> 14:47.834
Well... good night.

14:47.900 --> 14:49.967
-Good night...
-Lunch at noon.

14:50.033 --> 14:51.200
6 for dinner.

14:51.266 --> 14:52.166
10:00 for dancing.

14:52.233 --> 14:54.467
Midnight... for dessert.

14:56.934 --> 14:58.734
Dessert at midnight?

15:00.467 --> 15:02.533
There's always room for Jell-O.

15:08.834 --> 15:11.367
I just hate you.

15:11.433 --> 15:13.467
I regret the day you ever
moved in here.

15:13.533 --> 15:15.633
And I regret the day
I gave birth to you.

15:16.767 --> 15:20.533
Ma! Ma!
I'm your daughter.

15:20.600 --> 15:21.967
Oh, yeah.

15:24.333 --> 15:25.934
I need a bromo seltzer.

15:27.367 --> 15:29.600
I need a cheesecake.

15:35.100 --> 15:38.333
Blanche, I hate to see you and
Sophia fighting like that.

15:38.400 --> 15:40.467
She's trying to steal my man.

15:40.533 --> 15:42.000
And no one ever--

15:42.066 --> 15:44.967
(all) Steals a man from
Blanche Devereaux.

15:47.633 --> 15:50.367
Blanche, this all
about your ego, isn't it?

15:50.867 --> 15:52.500
Ego?

15:52.567 --> 15:55.400
Dorothy, I have no ego.

15:55.900 --> 15:57.867
And you can ask
the hundreds of men

15:57.934 --> 16:02.000
who will gladly cut off their
right arm to sleep with me.

16:02.066 --> 16:05.567
I agree with Dorothy I don't think
you'd even still be dating Fidel

16:05.633 --> 16:07.166
if another woman wasn't
interested in him.

16:07.233 --> 16:09.166
Girls, look,
I know it seems strange

16:09.233 --> 16:12.467
but I happen to have strong
feelings for Fidel.

16:12.533 --> 16:14.467
I can't explain it.

16:14.533 --> 16:17.533
Some things in life
defy explanation.

16:17.600 --> 16:20.133
Yeah, like Bruce Willis' hair.

16:24.667 --> 16:26.133
Blanche, let's talk.

16:26.200 --> 16:27.767
I'm in no mood to fight.

16:27.834 --> 16:30.000
That's what I want to talk about.

16:30.066 --> 16:32.600
We've been at each other's
throats for weeks.

16:32.667 --> 16:35.467
We're running each other ragged.

16:35.533 --> 16:36.600
It has to stop.

16:36.667 --> 16:38.734
I'm not giving Fidel up, Sophia.

16:38.800 --> 16:40.166
I am.

16:40.233 --> 16:42.000
I'm fighting a losing battle.

16:42.066 --> 16:43.400
You're younger, you're prettier.

16:43.467 --> 16:46.533
He'll choose you,
and it'll break my heart.

16:46.600 --> 16:48.300
He's yours, Blanche.

16:48.367 --> 16:49.867
No hard feelings.

16:50.367 --> 16:54.533
Oh, Sophia, wait.

16:54.600 --> 16:57.900
Why don't you take Fidel?
I have all those other boyfriends.

16:57.967 --> 16:59.900
Ok. Good night!

17:06.934 --> 17:08.867
Sophia!

17:08.934 --> 17:10.467
Sophia!

17:10.934 --> 17:14.100
(serene music playing)

17:16.233 --> 17:19.867
Rose,
I have a little a surprise for you.

17:19.934 --> 17:22.333
Cookies and milk.

17:22.400 --> 17:25.100
-Oh, my God, what's wrong?
-Nothing's wrong.

17:25.166 --> 17:28.133
You only do nice things when
something terrible has happened.

17:28.200 --> 17:31.467
-You failed the history test.
-What does that mean?

17:31.533 --> 17:34.567
It means you got more wrong
than right.

17:34.633 --> 17:36.700
I know that. I didn't fail math.

17:36.767 --> 17:38.266
I was talking about
the bigger picture.

17:38.333 --> 17:41.233
It means
you won't get your diploma.

17:42.500 --> 17:44.100
Yeah?

17:44.166 --> 17:46.100
Well, you have a big behind.

17:48.233 --> 17:50.433
Oh, Rose, Rose, please.

17:50.500 --> 17:52.867
Let's try to keep
this on an adult level

17:52.934 --> 17:54.266
and if you want to talk behinds,

17:54.333 --> 17:56.867
they could show
<i>How the West was Won </i>on yours.

17:59.400 --> 18:00.533
I can't believe this.

18:00.600 --> 18:05.100
I'm sorry, but I have to grade you
like everybody else.

18:05.166 --> 18:07.367
Well, look, Dorothy,
you made a mistake.

18:07.433 --> 18:09.200
I got that question right.

18:09.266 --> 18:13.166
"Who was the leader
of the third Reich?"

18:13.233 --> 18:17.266
You wrote "Fritz Shticklemeyer,"
your high school history teacher.

18:17.333 --> 18:21.033
The correct answer is Adolf Hitler.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.333
Where's my history book?

18:28.033 --> 18:29.233
Is this the man we're talking about?

18:29.300 --> 18:31.100
Yes. That is Adolf Hitler.

18:31.166 --> 18:33.300
You can call him
whatever you want,

18:33.367 --> 18:35.467
but that's Fritz Shticklemeyer.

18:37.200 --> 18:38.367
I'm as sure of that

18:38.433 --> 18:42.567
as I am that's Eva Braun
standing next to him.

18:42.633 --> 18:44.867
You recognize Eva Braun?

18:45.767 --> 18:48.967
Sure. She was our high school
P.E. teacher.

18:50.934 --> 18:54.166
It was rumored she used to date
Mr. Shticklemeyer.

18:55.700 --> 18:59.600
Rose, that's it.
I just can't take any more.

18:59.667 --> 19:03.500
With this question right,
you have a D-minus.

19:03.567 --> 19:06.467
Rose, you're a high
school graduate.

19:06.533 --> 19:08.967
Oh, boy!

19:10.433 --> 19:11.800
Sophia!

19:11.867 --> 19:14.734
Sophia,
I'm a high school graduate!

19:14.800 --> 19:18.500
Congratulations. Now you can get
any job involving a cardboard hat.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.533
Well, how do I look?

19:22.600 --> 19:24.767
Hey, terrific.

19:24.834 --> 19:26.033
Where are you going tonight?

19:26.100 --> 19:28.567
Fidel is taking me to
the Burt Reynolds dinner theater

19:28.633 --> 19:30.367
to see Ruth Buzzi in <i>Evita.</i>

19:31.867 --> 19:34.734
Dorothy, how do I,
where are you going?

19:34.800 --> 19:36.967
To the theater with Fidel.

19:37.033 --> 19:40.734
That's impossible. He invited
me yesterday after the movies.

19:40.800 --> 19:42.667
He invited me
yesterday after dinner.

19:42.734 --> 19:47.100
You've been running
that man ragged for weeks.

19:47.166 --> 19:48.934
It's no wonder
he got confused.

19:48.967 --> 19:50.867
(telephone rings)

19:51.367 --> 19:53.200
-Hello.
-Confused?

19:53.266 --> 19:57.000
How could he possibly confuse
this young, nubile body

19:57.066 --> 19:59.633
with that raisin in sneakers?

20:02.033 --> 20:03.700
There's only one way
to settle this.

20:03.767 --> 20:04.800
I'm going.

20:04.867 --> 20:06.300
Like hell!
I'm going!

20:06.367 --> 20:08.967
Neither one of you is going.

20:09.033 --> 20:10.000
Fidel isn't coming.

20:10.066 --> 20:11.300
Where is he?

20:11.800 --> 20:13.033
We killed him.

20:13.100 --> 20:14.867
I know.

20:14.934 --> 20:17.867
We might as well have put a gun
to poor Fidel's head.

20:17.934 --> 20:19.934
We were too much woman for him.

20:21.767 --> 20:25.300
His spirit was willing
but his poor heart couldn't take it.

20:25.367 --> 20:28.700
It's all our fault. Our silly
competitiveness did this.

20:28.767 --> 20:30.033
Oh, come on, you two.

20:30.100 --> 20:31.667
The man was in his seventies.

20:31.734 --> 20:33.367
These things just happen.

20:33.433 --> 20:36.400
You had nothing to do
with his heart giving out.

20:37.800 --> 20:40.600
Dorothy,
everyone here is a woman.

20:42.100 --> 20:46.133
We are gathered here today
to honor the memory of a man

20:46.200 --> 20:48.467
who has suddenly
been taken from us.

20:48.533 --> 20:50.867
What are you looking at me for?
Just keep talking.

20:52.567 --> 20:55.967
Fidel Santiago
was a very special man.

20:56.033 --> 20:58.367
He was kind, caring, and loving.

20:58.433 --> 21:02.667
He was a man who brought joy
into the lives of all he touched.

21:02.734 --> 21:05.800
-(sobbing)
-(sobbing)

21:07.400 --> 21:10.633
I have the feeling he touched
every behind in the room.

21:12.133 --> 21:15.066
Fidel Santiago lived life.

21:15.133 --> 21:18.433
Excuse me, father.
Hold that thought.

21:18.500 --> 21:21.333
Which of you was
Fidel's girlfriend?

21:21.400 --> 21:22.900
Oh!

21:24.066 --> 21:25.233
My God!

21:25.300 --> 21:28.500
He had his burro hitched
to every bedpost in town.

21:30.066 --> 21:32.066
But that's good news, girls.

21:32.133 --> 21:34.100
That means your cheap,
animal-like lust

21:34.166 --> 21:36.500
didn't have anything to do
with killing Fidel.

21:38.266 --> 21:40.900
I'm leaving. I won't mourn a man

21:40.967 --> 21:43.100
who's been with every woman
in this room.

21:43.166 --> 21:44.633
He wasn't with me.

21:45.166 --> 21:48.300
I guess even he
had his standards.

21:51.934 --> 21:54.567
Hold it. Stay where you are.

21:54.633 --> 21:56.100
Father, if you don't
mind my saying so,

21:56.166 --> 21:57.900
I think you lost
control of the room.

21:59.767 --> 22:00.500
Excuse me.

22:01.567 --> 22:05.100
The man in that box
was a bum,

22:05.166 --> 22:06.700
a scoundrel, a cheat, and a liar.

22:06.767 --> 22:08.100
You got that right.

22:08.166 --> 22:09.967
Quiet. I work alone.

22:12.900 --> 22:15.200
But there was
another side to him,

22:15.266 --> 22:16.633
and it was beautiful.

22:16.700 --> 22:22.066
He awakened feelings in me
I haven't felt in 35 years.

22:22.133 --> 22:25.633
We used to hug
and kiss and hold hands,

22:25.700 --> 22:27.066
and it was nice.

22:28.166 --> 22:31.567
He made me feel attractive
and desirable again.

22:31.633 --> 22:35.266
He probably made the rest of you
feel that way too,

22:35.333 --> 22:38.667
and looking out at this kennel club,
that was no small accomplishment.

22:42.433 --> 22:45.166
You may all hate
Fidel right now,

22:45.233 --> 22:51.100
but I know the next time
I'm sitting in the park

22:51.166 --> 22:55.033
and I smell the aroma
of a cheap cigar,

22:55.100 --> 23:00.333
I'll think of Fidel Santiago,
and I'll smile.

23:03.300 --> 23:07.100
-Oh, Ma, that was very sweet.
-Just lovely, Sophia.

23:07.166 --> 23:11.233
Can you ever forgive me
for all those ugly things I said?

23:11.300 --> 23:13.266
Of course I can.

23:13.333 --> 23:16.266
If I could, I'd let you have Fidel.

23:16.767 --> 23:19.333
Oh, you're so generous.

23:19.400 --> 23:22.266
The man's packing material.
Now you're letting me have him?

23:22.333 --> 23:24.834
I have coat racks livelier than him.

23:24.900 --> 23:26.533
She's giving him to me.

23:26.600 --> 23:30.266
There's more powder
on his face than Ann Miller's.

23:30.333 --> 23:33.133
Some lumber would make
a better dancing partner.

23:33.200 --> 23:35.734
(Sophia) Thanks for the Edsel!

23:43.900 --> 23:47.433
(theme music playing)
