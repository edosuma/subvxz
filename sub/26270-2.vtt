WEBVTT

00:01.902 --> 00:03.171
-9-1-1. What's your emergency?
-(siren wailing)

00:03.204 --> 00:05.206
Let's get him out of here
before this thing blows!

00:05.239 --> 00:07.041
Catch all-new episodes Mondays,

00:07.075 --> 00:08.842
and check out
our other Fox programs--

00:08.876 --> 00:12.012
Empire, The Resident,
and The Gifted.

00:12.046 --> 00:14.582
We are going to show you
the dawn of a new age.

00:14.615 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.992
(indistinct chatter)

00:25.025 --> 00:26.560
TEENAGE MAN:
(whistles softly) Wow.

00:26.594 --> 00:29.997
This is way nicer than the place
we stayed at last night.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.066
FATHER: And it's central to
everything we're here to see.

00:32.100 --> 00:34.001
-GIRL: Disneyland?
-That's a little bit further,

00:34.034 --> 00:35.403
but Harry Potter's
right over that hill.

00:35.436 --> 00:37.004
Yay! I want a wand.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.539
MOTHER:
Can we afford this?

00:38.572 --> 00:40.174
I'm using reward points
we've been saving

00:40.208 --> 00:42.276
since before Kat was born.
We're good.

00:48.282 --> 00:50.684
She's my emotional support dog.

00:50.718 --> 00:54.255
And by refusing me entry,
you are violating federal law

00:54.288 --> 00:57.024
and risking me
having a panic attack.

00:57.057 --> 00:59.293
-(barks)
-That's a baby.

00:59.327 --> 01:00.961
So, the prize
for winning the tournament

01:00.994 --> 01:02.963
was a trip to the regional
championship in Reno.

01:02.996 --> 01:05.599
The prize for losing
in the first round

01:05.633 --> 01:08.269
is all the pancakes
you guys can possibly eat.

01:08.302 --> 01:10.037
-(laughter)
-All right, so why don't you
head on down

01:10.070 --> 01:11.272
to the restaurant
while I get us checked out?

01:11.305 --> 01:14.074
-Yup.
-Pickens, you come with me.

01:16.076 --> 01:19.046
A recruiter from Duke is coming
to see you when we get back.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.415
North Carolina? I don't know.

01:21.449 --> 01:23.484
After seeing that campus
at UCLA...

01:23.517 --> 01:25.886
Oh, you mean the California
girls all over it?

01:25.919 --> 01:28.989
Look, it can't hurt to listen
to what Duke and Stanford

01:29.022 --> 01:30.491
and what every other top school
who's gonna try

01:30.524 --> 01:31.892
and recruit you has to say.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.894
-Whatever you say, Coach.
-All right.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.396
That's my guy. What's our motto?

01:35.429 --> 01:37.165
-Heart of a champion.
-That's right.

01:37.198 --> 01:39.433
(laughs)

01:39.467 --> 01:41.235
Still cleaning the rooms.

01:41.269 --> 01:42.603
I guess that's what we get
for arriving at checkout.

01:42.636 --> 01:44.004
Who's hungry?

01:44.037 --> 01:45.773
-Me.
-(laughs)

01:45.806 --> 01:46.940
Come here.

01:46.974 --> 01:48.942
Ooh.

01:48.976 --> 01:50.811
*

01:53.714 --> 01:55.649
(cell phone chimes)

02:08.862 --> 02:10.864
(elevator bell dings)

02:16.136 --> 02:18.539
*

02:27.248 --> 02:31.018
Ali. Come on in, hon.

02:31.051 --> 02:33.354
Can't apologize enough

02:33.387 --> 02:35.223
for making you cool your heels
in the lobby.

02:35.256 --> 02:36.857
Been a crazy morning.

02:36.890 --> 02:38.459
You know, I had to close
the Miami deal,

02:38.492 --> 02:41.329
conference call
with the money boys in Dubai

02:41.362 --> 02:44.398
and I'm still operating
on Dallas time. (laughs)

02:44.432 --> 02:48.135
I swear, sometimes
I forget where I am.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.137
Every city starts
to look the same to me.

02:50.170 --> 02:54.275
You know, the inside
of another luxury hotel suite.

02:56.377 --> 02:58.546
So show me what you got.

02:58.579 --> 03:01.515
Okay.

03:01.549 --> 03:06.086
So, based on what we discussed,

03:06.119 --> 03:11.158
I have gone back
to a more Mediterranean vibe

03:11.191 --> 03:12.693
for the townhouses.

03:12.726 --> 03:14.762
Oh, yeah.

03:14.795 --> 03:17.331
-(cell phone ringing)
-Oh, yeah, this is...

03:17.365 --> 03:18.899
this is terrific work.

03:18.932 --> 03:20.668
Do you need to get that?

03:20.701 --> 03:23.070
Nah, it's just my wife.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.176
MOTHER:
There's a walking tour

03:29.209 --> 03:31.612
that shows where
they filmed old movies.

03:31.645 --> 03:33.347
That'll pack them in.

03:33.381 --> 03:35.783
-I need to pee.
-Oh, you know
where it is, honey?

03:35.816 --> 03:38.151
-Yeah, I can find it.
-Okay.

03:40.153 --> 03:43.056
-She okay?
-Yeah, yeah. I can see her.

03:43.090 --> 03:44.958
She likes feeling grown up.

03:44.992 --> 03:46.527
WOMAN:
The toast is touching the eggs.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.863
Now there's gluten in my eggs.
This is all wrong.

03:49.897 --> 03:51.365
Paisley.

03:51.399 --> 03:52.900
Now see? You've upset her.

03:52.933 --> 03:54.802
She's gluten intolerant, too.

03:54.835 --> 03:56.970
Ugh. Paisley.

03:57.004 --> 03:59.573
Paisley! Oh.

04:00.641 --> 04:02.276
Would you like some coffee?

04:02.310 --> 04:05.045
Oh, no. No thanks.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.014
How about a mimosa?

04:08.148 --> 04:09.950
In the shower?

04:09.983 --> 04:12.420
-What? No.
-What?

04:12.453 --> 04:14.121
Are you out of your mind?

04:14.154 --> 04:16.457
You are blowing this
way out of proportion.

04:16.490 --> 04:18.492
There is no
proportional response

04:18.526 --> 04:20.994
to being asked by your boss
to shower with him.

04:21.028 --> 04:23.997
I'm reporting this to HR
and the board.

04:24.031 --> 04:25.633
We're a publically traded
company, you pig.

04:25.666 --> 04:27.401
HR is terrified of me

04:27.435 --> 04:31.004
and I handpicked every member
of that board.

04:31.038 --> 04:32.640
I'll invite them all
to Sardinia on my boat

04:32.673 --> 04:35.242
and they will forget
they ever heard of you.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.844
I will destroy you.

04:39.012 --> 04:41.749
-Hi. It's okay.
-(whimpering)

04:41.782 --> 04:43.183
Don't be afraid.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.655
(rumbling)

04:49.857 --> 04:51.959
Kat.

04:51.992 --> 04:54.862
-(people screaming)
-Kat!

04:56.964 --> 04:58.766
Whoa!

04:58.799 --> 05:00.534
-What the hell?
-Earthquake.

05:00.568 --> 05:03.036
(people screaming)

05:04.037 --> 05:05.839
-Go!
-Kat!

05:05.873 --> 05:07.741
-(whining)
-Dad!

05:09.377 --> 05:10.844
Watch out!

05:11.979 --> 05:14.047
Kat! Kat!

05:14.081 --> 05:16.216
-Kat!
-Dad!

05:16.249 --> 05:18.051
-Paisley!
-(barks)

05:21.555 --> 05:23.190
Oh, God!

05:23.223 --> 05:24.392
Dad!

05:31.599 --> 05:33.367
(screaming)

05:40.073 --> 05:42.576
Dad! Dad!

05:42.610 --> 05:45.045
-Pickens!
-Coach!

05:45.078 --> 05:46.780
(people screaming)

05:55.756 --> 05:57.024
(grunts)

05:57.057 --> 05:59.059
Kat!

06:01.962 --> 06:04.732
-Kat!
-(electricity buzzing)

06:04.765 --> 06:06.767
Kat.

06:09.903 --> 06:12.573
Kat!

06:27.755 --> 06:29.757
(car alarms wailing)

06:38.398 --> 06:40.400
*

06:54.347 --> 06:56.784
-Hey, Dad.
-Yeah?

06:56.817 --> 07:01.789
Hey, Dad, do you think
dogs know they're dogs?

07:01.822 --> 07:03.991
What do you mean?

07:04.024 --> 07:06.660
You-you know,
like, I'm a person

07:06.694 --> 07:09.963
-and a dog is a dog.
-Mm-hmm.

07:09.997 --> 07:12.265
But do dogs just think
we're bigger,

07:12.299 --> 07:17.304
less hairier, smarter dogs
that walk funny?

07:17.337 --> 07:20.140
Thank God for you, kid.

07:20.173 --> 07:23.176
-(bell rings)
-All right.
You got to hustle up.

07:23.210 --> 07:24.612
All right?

07:24.645 --> 07:26.580
-Love you.
-Oh.

07:26.614 --> 07:28.916
I love you, too, son.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.951
Go to school, buddy.

07:46.233 --> 07:48.201
You ever feel like
you missed your calling, Cap?

07:48.235 --> 07:49.603
What are you thinking?

07:49.637 --> 07:50.938
Michelin-rated restaurant
or short order cook?

07:50.971 --> 07:52.472
CHIMNEY:
I was thinking TV chef.

07:52.506 --> 07:54.542
I mean, what you do,
it's like performance art.

07:54.575 --> 07:56.109
Mm-hmm, and much like
watching cooking on TV,

07:56.143 --> 07:57.878
we never get to taste anything.

07:57.911 --> 08:00.047
Usually by the time it hits
the table, the bell goes off.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.015
BOBBY:
All right, speed round.

08:02.049 --> 08:04.217
If you weren't doing this,
what would you be doing?

08:04.251 --> 08:07.454
Fighter pilot. Topgun.
Call sign: Shogun.

08:07.487 --> 08:10.023
-(laughs)
-What about you, Hen?

08:10.057 --> 08:12.893
Editorial cartoonist,
The New Yorker.

08:14.762 --> 08:17.330
-I have a lot to say.
-You draw?

08:17.364 --> 08:19.466
No, it's a dream. It's not
supposed to be attainable.

08:19.499 --> 08:22.903
-Topgun? You can barely drive,
you rebar head.
-Hey.

08:22.936 --> 08:24.404
All right, Buckaroo.

08:24.437 --> 08:26.139
If you were not a member
of the LAFD,

08:26.173 --> 08:27.708
what would you be doing?

08:27.741 --> 08:29.577
Uh, I don't know.

08:29.610 --> 08:31.478
I'm not getting fired, am I?

08:31.511 --> 08:34.848
-That's inevitable.
-He'd be a golden retriever.

08:34.882 --> 08:37.517
No, a bartender. No, no, no,
bouncer at a bar.

08:37.551 --> 08:40.253
-A bouncer at a strip club.
-CHIMNEY: What.

08:40.287 --> 08:41.421
HEN:
What.

08:41.454 --> 08:43.223
What's going on with you, kid?

08:43.256 --> 08:45.392
Just traffic sucks in this town

08:45.425 --> 08:47.928
unless you're driving ten tons
of engine with sirens.

08:47.961 --> 08:51.098
It took me almost two hours
to get from Abby's place

08:51.131 --> 08:53.000
to the call center downtown,
then back over here.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.569
Just told Maddie she needs
to start Ubering.

08:55.603 --> 08:57.337
How's your sister
settling in down there?

08:57.370 --> 08:59.539
Well, she's a Buckley.

08:59.573 --> 09:02.409
Practically running the place.

09:08.616 --> 09:10.684
Here's how shadowing works.

09:10.718 --> 09:13.220
I talk, you listen and
hopefully you learn something

09:13.253 --> 09:14.855
about being a dispatcher.

09:14.888 --> 09:17.557
Questions? Save them
for after my state-mandated,

09:17.591 --> 09:21.394
ten-minute break which will be
in three hours and 12 minutes.

09:21.428 --> 09:24.231
First thing, everybody lies.

09:24.264 --> 09:26.900
Dr. Gregory House
was right about that.

09:26.934 --> 09:28.201
Sometimes they know
that they're lying.

09:28.235 --> 09:30.537
"Oh, I had no idea
that this would happen.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.039
I just slipped and fell
on that cucumber."

09:32.072 --> 09:34.074
Other times, whatever
they're experiencing

09:34.107 --> 09:35.609
in the moment
is scrambling their brains.

09:35.643 --> 09:37.778
They are the ultimate
unreliable narrators.

09:37.811 --> 09:40.580
-Uh, who's Dr. House?
-You're one of those,
aren't you?

09:40.614 --> 09:43.150
A reader.

09:43.183 --> 09:46.086
The point is you can't
trust people, only yourself.

09:46.119 --> 09:47.454
-If it sounds like bull,
it probably is.
-(phone ringing)

09:47.487 --> 09:49.256
911, what is your emergency?

09:49.289 --> 09:50.724
WOMAN (over phone):
I'm having chest pains.

09:50.758 --> 09:52.726
When did the pain start?

09:52.760 --> 09:54.094
911, what is your emergency?

09:54.127 --> 09:56.063
MAN: I was playing pinfinger
and I really messed up.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.497
There's a knife
impaled in my hand.

09:57.530 --> 09:59.066
I-I got to get it out.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.600
No, don't pull it out.
Just leave it right there.

10:00.634 --> 10:02.502
You would think after
14 seasons of Grey's Anatomy

10:02.535 --> 10:03.503
that people
would know this stuff.

10:03.536 --> 10:05.105
How bad is it bleeding?

10:05.138 --> 10:06.339
MAN:
It's gushing.

10:06.373 --> 10:08.408
Okay, the EMTs are on their way.

10:08.441 --> 10:11.178
So, questions? No?

10:11.211 --> 10:12.345
Good, then it's your turn.

10:12.379 --> 10:15.115
Wait, my turn to take a call?

10:15.148 --> 10:17.484
See one, do one, teach one.

10:17.517 --> 10:19.319
FYI, this is the middle part.

10:19.352 --> 10:22.489
I'll be here
like training wheels.

10:22.522 --> 10:25.058
(exhales)

10:26.493 --> 10:28.361
(phone ringing)

10:28.395 --> 10:30.363
911, what is your emergency?

10:30.397 --> 10:32.365
MAN 2: Help, please.
Can't breathe.

10:32.399 --> 10:34.001
What is your location, sir?

10:34.034 --> 10:36.136
Ocean Park and Lincoln
by the sushi place.

10:36.169 --> 10:37.805
(under breath): Sushi restaurant
at Ocean Park Boulevard

10:37.838 --> 10:39.673
and Lincoln Boulevard.

10:39.707 --> 10:42.142
Um, are you having
tightness in your chest,

10:42.175 --> 10:44.277
-pain in your arms?
-N-No.

10:44.311 --> 10:45.779
Throat's swollen.

10:45.813 --> 10:48.448
-Do you have any allergies?
-Shellfish.

10:48.481 --> 10:49.482
-I told them.
-Okay, it sounds like

10:49.516 --> 10:50.984
you're having
an allergic reaction.

10:51.018 --> 10:52.519
Help is on the way now.

10:52.552 --> 10:53.821
-Can you elevate your legs?
-(car engine revs)

10:53.854 --> 10:55.155
Uh, no.

10:55.188 --> 10:56.724
Sir, are you out on a street?

10:56.757 --> 10:58.291
Parking lot, in my car.

10:58.325 --> 10:59.492
Okay, what kind of car
are we looking for?

10:59.526 --> 11:00.861
Gray Challenger.

11:00.894 --> 11:03.831
Help is on the way.
Can I see that?

11:08.501 --> 11:11.338
He could have been unconscious
by the time the EMTs arrived

11:11.371 --> 11:14.207
because they would have had
no idea where to find him.

11:14.241 --> 11:16.176
Because you were so busy
with your checklist,

11:16.209 --> 11:19.512
you didn't hear the sound
of the engine running.

11:19.546 --> 11:21.849
I understand.
I've been an ER nurse

11:21.882 --> 11:23.183
for the last eight years.

11:23.216 --> 11:24.551
People out there
are in crisis,

11:24.584 --> 11:26.720
and we need to see it all,

11:26.754 --> 11:28.756
no matter what their
panicked minds are telling us.

11:28.789 --> 11:30.090
Because the only sense

11:30.123 --> 11:32.025
that we get to use
to solve this problem

11:32.059 --> 11:33.861
is our listening.

11:33.894 --> 11:36.129
I'm sorry,
did you say something?

11:38.065 --> 11:40.367
-Listening. Oh...
-Funny?

11:40.400 --> 11:42.669
-Yeah, so funny. Yeah.
-I'm glad.

11:42.702 --> 11:45.238
(sirens wailing)

11:45.272 --> 11:48.541
*

11:54.081 --> 11:56.383
* What you think about me

11:56.416 --> 11:58.185
* I won't try to argue

11:58.218 --> 12:00.253
* Or hold it against you

12:00.287 --> 12:04.691
* I know that you're leaving,
you must have your reasons *

12:04.724 --> 12:07.127
* The season is calling

12:07.160 --> 12:10.063
-* Your pictures are
falling down *
-Hold it right there!

12:10.097 --> 12:11.631
*

12:11.664 --> 12:13.934
* Well, I guess this is
growing up *

12:16.136 --> 12:18.438
-Hey!
-* Well, I guess this is
growing up. *

12:45.665 --> 12:47.434
Where you planning
on running, Marvin?

12:47.467 --> 12:49.536
This is your house.

12:54.007 --> 12:56.676
You know, if you're going
to keep stealing cars,

12:56.709 --> 12:58.812
you might want to consider
a less memorable hair color.

12:58.846 --> 13:00.447
When I hear a felonious act,

13:00.480 --> 13:02.482
the suspect matches
your description,

13:02.515 --> 13:04.351
I know where to find you.

13:04.384 --> 13:06.854
This is the third time I've had
to arrest you this year.

13:06.887 --> 13:09.189
The hair is my signature.

13:09.222 --> 13:10.958
All master criminals have one.

13:10.991 --> 13:12.459
Yeah, all stupid ones.

13:12.492 --> 13:14.027
I'm just getting
all of my stealing done

13:14.061 --> 13:15.262
before I turn 18.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.663
I'm joyriding, which is like

13:16.696 --> 13:18.198
borrowing the car
without asking.

13:18.231 --> 13:19.532
Only thing I steal

13:19.566 --> 13:20.700
is some gas from a tank,
if you think about it.

13:20.733 --> 13:21.869
Well, you're not going

13:21.902 --> 13:22.870
to juvie court
this time, Marvin.

13:22.903 --> 13:24.371
Ran from the police.

13:24.404 --> 13:26.173
It's serious now.

13:36.016 --> 13:38.085
Am I really going to jail?

13:39.586 --> 13:41.488
Like, real jail?

13:41.521 --> 13:43.891
You committed grown-up crimes.

13:43.924 --> 13:46.493
Grand theft auto,
evading the police,

13:46.526 --> 13:48.128
reckless driving.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.997
You're lucky
you didn't hurt anyone.

13:51.031 --> 13:53.533
I'm not gonna make it to jail.

13:53.566 --> 13:56.937
My mom's gonna kill me first.

14:05.712 --> 14:07.714
-(rumbling)
-(tires squealing)

14:07.747 --> 14:10.217
-The hell?
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.787
(gasps) Oh, my God.

14:17.724 --> 14:19.927
(people screaming)

14:22.295 --> 14:24.864
-Okay, that's at least a six.
-Seven.

14:29.636 --> 14:31.604
HEN:
Get out! Get out, guys!

14:31.638 --> 14:33.173
-Come on!
-CHIMNEY: Get out.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.774
Get out. Get out. Go. Go.

14:41.481 --> 14:44.284
Go, go, go, go!

14:48.956 --> 14:51.558
-Anybody else back there?
-No.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.593
(shouting over each other)

15:04.337 --> 15:05.405
Oh, my God!

15:05.438 --> 15:07.407
Whoa, whoa. Hold on, hold on.

15:21.188 --> 15:23.190
(car alarms wailing)

15:50.617 --> 15:52.485
(exhales)

15:52.519 --> 15:54.187
Brace for impact.

15:54.221 --> 15:55.822
(phones ringing)

15:55.855 --> 15:57.524
911. What's your emergency?

15:57.557 --> 16:00.127
-911. What's your emergency?
-911. What's your emergency?

16:06.733 --> 16:09.136
(siren wailing)

16:17.844 --> 16:19.846
(electricity crackling)

16:27.320 --> 16:29.856
Is everything okay?

16:29.889 --> 16:31.691
Yeah. There's no service.

16:31.724 --> 16:34.361
Texts won't even get through.

16:34.394 --> 16:36.529
Who you trying to get ahold of?

16:39.566 --> 16:42.735
My son.
I'm trying to reach my son.

16:42.769 --> 16:45.372
BUCK:
Whoa, you got a kid?

16:45.405 --> 16:47.207
Christopher.

16:47.240 --> 16:49.076
He's seven.

16:49.109 --> 16:52.212
And super adorable.
I, uh, I love kids.

16:52.245 --> 16:54.847
I love this one.

16:54.881 --> 16:56.849
I'm all he's got.

16:56.883 --> 16:58.851
His mother's not in the picture.

16:59.886 --> 17:02.389
He's at school?

17:03.423 --> 17:05.392
Yeah.

17:05.425 --> 17:08.461
Hey, I'm sure he's fine.

17:10.930 --> 17:13.433
(horn honking)

17:33.286 --> 17:36.523
-You guys ever deal
with anything like this before?
-No.

17:36.556 --> 17:39.259
(woman shouting)

17:39.292 --> 17:41.027
I have to get back in there.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.929
No, you have to let me back
in there!

17:42.962 --> 17:45.132
-My baby's in there!
-Please, our daughter is
still inside!

17:45.165 --> 17:46.733
-She's eight years old!
-No, my daughter's inside!

17:46.766 --> 17:48.801
Kat. Her name is Kat!

17:48.835 --> 17:51.238
FATHER:
You have to let me in there!

17:51.271 --> 17:53.806
She's all alone! Stop it!

17:53.840 --> 17:56.909
They seriously think
that's gonna hold it up?

17:56.943 --> 17:58.911
Let's go find
the incident commander.

18:01.148 --> 18:03.082
Any word from Athena?

18:03.116 --> 18:04.584
Haven't been able
to get ahold of her.

18:04.617 --> 18:07.086
-What about you? Karen? Denny?
-Same.

18:07.120 --> 18:08.655
Cell phones are toast
everywhere.

18:08.688 --> 18:11.824
The system must be overloaded.

18:11.858 --> 18:15.595
Captain. Chief Williams,
incident commander.

18:15.628 --> 18:17.230
Captain Bobby Nash.
How can we help you?

18:17.264 --> 18:18.898
Hotel manager said
they were between checkout

18:18.931 --> 18:20.300
and check-in when the quake hit,

18:20.333 --> 18:21.934
so they were light on guests.

18:21.968 --> 18:24.070
We've made contact
with most of those.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.005
Multiple evac operations
in progress.

18:26.038 --> 18:28.741
All but 12 of the 68 staff
have been accounted for.

18:28.775 --> 18:29.976
-It's been pretty chaotic.
-The family back there

18:30.009 --> 18:31.744
said their little girl
is still missing.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.246
As long as it's still safe
to do so,

18:33.280 --> 18:34.681
we'll be looking
for any survivors.

18:34.714 --> 18:36.115
What do your engineers
have to say?

18:36.149 --> 18:37.484
Looks like we had
a brittle failure

18:37.517 --> 18:38.985
in the prestressed
concrete section

18:39.018 --> 18:40.320
of the building's
underground parking garage,

18:40.353 --> 18:42.689
causing it to pancake
at an angle.

18:44.291 --> 18:46.759
Right now the reinforced steel
is the only thing keeping it

18:46.793 --> 18:48.961
from completely collapsing.
One good aftershock...

18:48.995 --> 18:51.498
And the whole thing
could come down.

18:51.531 --> 18:52.932
A high-rise is supposed to be
the safest place to be

18:52.965 --> 18:54.667
when an earthquake hits.

18:54.701 --> 18:57.304
Not when you're built
right on top of a fault line.

18:57.337 --> 18:58.538
This quake was a 7.1.

18:58.571 --> 19:00.473
Northridge was just a 6.7.

19:00.507 --> 19:02.709
7.1-- that makes the largest
in SoCal in 20 years.

19:02.742 --> 19:04.644
And the last one
was in Joshua Tree.

19:04.677 --> 19:06.979
-BOBBY: How many crews
do you have in there?
-Not enough.

19:07.013 --> 19:08.548
We've put in a request
for Heavy Rescue 3,

19:08.581 --> 19:10.049
but they're on their way
to a freeway collapse.

19:10.082 --> 19:11.718
We can use every hand
we can get.

19:11.751 --> 19:14.654
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

19:14.687 --> 19:16.656
Okay, listen up.

19:16.689 --> 19:18.658
Here's how you make it
to the end of the day.

19:18.691 --> 19:20.059
You don't worry about the things

19:20.092 --> 19:21.328
that you can't
do anything about.

19:21.361 --> 19:23.330
Focus on one task at a time.

19:23.363 --> 19:25.832
I can't order you guys
to go inside that building,

19:25.865 --> 19:28.568
and I'm not gonna judge you
if you decide not to.

19:30.603 --> 19:33.039
-Hen, you got a kid, so...
-Yeah.

19:33.072 --> 19:34.674
And I'd hope if someone
whose job it was to save him

19:34.707 --> 19:35.842
had the chance, they'd do it.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.810
No matter what.

19:37.844 --> 19:39.879
Where do you want us?

19:39.912 --> 19:41.548
POLICE OFFICER:
Hey.

19:41.581 --> 19:43.850
You guys will want to see this.

19:51.758 --> 19:53.893
CHIMNEY: We could
set up a bag street-side

19:53.926 --> 19:55.328
in case that window gives.

19:55.362 --> 19:57.564
Nobody works under that side
of the building.

19:57.597 --> 19:59.699
Somebody's gonna have
to get him from the inside.

19:59.732 --> 20:02.168
Buck, you say
that's the 11th floor?

20:02.201 --> 20:05.071
BUCK:
I would.

20:05.104 --> 20:06.839
I bet we could take the ladder
to that fourth floor.

20:06.873 --> 20:09.942
Cut the distance in half.

20:09.976 --> 20:11.944
Head on up.

20:38.671 --> 20:42.442
After Northridge,
FEMA spent $200 million

20:42.475 --> 20:45.077
retrofitting every school
in the LAUSD.

20:45.111 --> 20:48.147
Ceiling tiles,
lighting fixtures...

20:48.180 --> 20:50.383
Eddie, your kid is
in the safest place he can be.

20:50.417 --> 20:52.619
Thought that was a high-rise.

21:05.465 --> 21:07.266
MAY:
I still don't have service.

21:07.300 --> 21:09.602
MICHAEL: Neither does
half of the people in L.A.

21:09.636 --> 21:12.271
We can try your mom again later.

21:12.305 --> 21:14.273
(horns honking)

21:14.307 --> 21:16.476
Come on.

21:16.509 --> 21:17.910
MICHAEL:
E-Excuse me.

21:17.944 --> 21:19.346
Excuse me,
I'm looking for my son.

21:19.379 --> 21:20.847
The reunion gate station
is located

21:20.880 --> 21:22.515
-at the gymnasium, sir.
-Okay.

21:22.549 --> 21:23.783
MAY:
Dad, I see him.

21:23.816 --> 21:25.818
I see him, I see him!

21:26.853 --> 21:28.455
MICHAEL:
Harry!

21:28.488 --> 21:29.856
Hey, Dad.

21:31.157 --> 21:33.159
(panting, laughs)

21:35.194 --> 21:37.364
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

21:37.397 --> 21:39.332
-Dad, did you see the school?
-Yeah.

21:39.366 --> 21:41.100
We probably won't come back
for another month.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.168
Isn't that awesome?

21:42.201 --> 21:45.137
No, Harry, it's not awesome.

21:45.171 --> 21:46.606
A lot of people got hurt.

21:46.639 --> 21:48.341
And there's still
some people missing.

21:48.375 --> 21:50.109
MAY:
You should try Mom again.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.277
She'd want to know
we have Harry.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.112
Give me your phone.

21:53.145 --> 21:55.782
Uh, still no service.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.684
Wait, where's Mom?

21:57.717 --> 22:01.153
She's working.

22:01.187 --> 22:02.722
(indistinct police
radio chatter)

22:02.755 --> 22:05.392
If you can drive,

22:05.425 --> 22:07.059
move your car to the shoulder!

22:07.093 --> 22:09.529
Clear a path
for emergency vehicles!

22:09.562 --> 22:11.230
All your guys accounted for?

22:11.263 --> 22:13.566
-Fire and rescue's on the way.
-Yeah, thank God.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.868
All right, you need to get
people out of their cars

22:15.902 --> 22:17.704
before the rest of this overpass
comes down.

22:17.737 --> 22:19.171
If they can be moved, move them.

22:19.205 --> 22:21.040
If you're not sure,
come and find me.

22:21.073 --> 22:23.042
But mind yourself first.
You want to be a hero,

22:23.075 --> 22:25.945
be the one who lives
to tell the tale.

22:27.013 --> 22:28.448
(man coughs)

22:30.282 --> 22:33.820
(man groaning)

22:33.853 --> 22:37.424
Sir. Sir, can you hear me?

22:37.457 --> 22:39.826
-Can you tell me your name?
-Dean.

22:39.859 --> 22:42.361
Dean? I'm Sergeant Grant.

22:42.395 --> 22:44.230
There was an earthquake.
You were in an accident.

22:44.263 --> 22:46.733
But help is on the way.

22:46.766 --> 22:48.501
Ah! I can't move, I...

22:48.535 --> 22:50.102
I can't get out!

22:50.136 --> 22:51.771
All right,
enhance your calm, Dean.

22:51.804 --> 22:54.206
We're gonna get you out of here
as fast as we can.

22:54.240 --> 22:55.241
(sniffs)

22:55.274 --> 22:57.677
DEAN:
I smell gas.

22:57.710 --> 22:58.845
Okay.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.680
I smell gas.

23:00.713 --> 23:03.149
(phone buzzing)

23:05.952 --> 23:08.688
Michael, Michael,
are the kids with you?

23:08.721 --> 23:10.189
-Michael, you're breaking up!
-MARVIN: Let me out!

23:10.222 --> 23:11.257
You wouldn't treat
a dog this way.

23:11.290 --> 23:12.592
A dog would be
more help right now.

23:12.625 --> 23:13.860
Michael, Michael,

23:13.893 --> 23:16.228
are you with...
Michael, you're breaking up.

23:16.262 --> 23:18.064
Just tell me the kids
are with you.

23:18.097 --> 23:19.766
(phone beeps off)

23:19.799 --> 23:21.167
DEAN:
Ah! Hey!

23:22.301 --> 23:24.871
Hey! Help!

23:24.904 --> 23:27.239
(Dean continues shouting)

23:28.508 --> 23:30.677
Ah!

23:37.817 --> 23:40.286
How you doing, Dean?

23:40.319 --> 23:42.689
I feel dizzy,
and it's getting hot.

23:46.793 --> 23:48.127
It's so hot.

23:59.806 --> 24:01.273
Are those all the extinguishers
you could find?

24:01.307 --> 24:03.275
Underground gas line
must have ruptured

24:03.309 --> 24:05.678
-when the car hit the pavement.
-We can't put the fire out

24:05.712 --> 24:08.147
with a constant energy source
keeping it going.

24:08.180 --> 24:10.650
It's like this car
is sitting on top of a stovetop.

24:10.683 --> 24:12.919
DEAN:
Help!

24:12.952 --> 24:14.521
Oh, God, please!

24:14.554 --> 24:15.755
I don't want to burn.

24:15.788 --> 24:17.323
Can't we cut him out?

24:17.356 --> 24:18.825
He's jammed in there.

24:18.858 --> 24:20.493
I need something bigger
to cool this thing down.

24:24.631 --> 24:26.165
(crying)

24:27.466 --> 24:28.801
The cement truck.

24:28.835 --> 24:30.770
-Who has the keys?
-Miguel.

24:30.803 --> 24:33.806
But-but he's helping people
on the other side.

24:33.840 --> 24:35.374
DEAN:
Help!

24:35.407 --> 24:37.376
Help!

24:39.712 --> 24:42.649
Can you hot-wire
that cement truck?

24:42.682 --> 24:44.884
That's a 2004 Peterbilt
357 MTM...

24:44.917 --> 24:47.186
I don't need the review
from Car and Dumbass.

24:47.219 --> 24:49.288
I need you to bring it over
to that fire.

24:49.321 --> 24:51.290
Can you?

24:51.323 --> 24:54.026
I can hot-wire that bad boy
with my eyes closed.

24:54.060 --> 24:56.462
I'm giving you the authority
to commandeer that truck

24:56.495 --> 24:58.330
and that truck only
for official police business.

24:58.364 --> 25:00.733
But if you run away, Marvin,
and that man dies,

25:00.767 --> 25:03.803
your life as you know it
will be over.

25:03.836 --> 25:06.673
My life's already over.

25:06.706 --> 25:10.610
You will wish you were in jail
if you piss me off.

25:17.617 --> 25:20.052
RESCUE WORKER:
All right, we have to clear out!

25:40.406 --> 25:42.842
DEAN:
Please, God!

25:42.875 --> 25:44.543
(crying)

25:47.580 --> 25:49.348
(grunts)

25:49.381 --> 25:50.817
Marvin!

25:57.256 --> 26:01.227
(engine starts)

26:01.260 --> 26:02.595
Yeah!

26:02.629 --> 26:04.631
I'm the king!

26:22.815 --> 26:24.884
Push, push.

26:24.917 --> 26:26.753
Push it.

26:26.786 --> 26:29.521
Okay, hit it.

26:36.262 --> 26:39.832
(sizzling)

26:39.866 --> 26:42.234
Come on, come on.

26:42.268 --> 26:44.704
-(Marvin grunts)
-All right, hold.

26:51.210 --> 26:52.511
Passenger side.

26:56.015 --> 26:58.017
You cooling down?

26:58.050 --> 27:00.019
Yeah. Thank you.

27:00.052 --> 27:02.021
All right.
You hang in there, Dean.

27:02.054 --> 27:04.023
Help's coming.

27:04.056 --> 27:06.826
(panting)

27:06.859 --> 27:08.494
PARAMEDIC: Hey.
Sir, we're gonna get you out,

27:08.527 --> 27:10.863
-all right? Just stay calm.
-DEAN: Okay.

27:10.897 --> 27:12.431
MARVIN:
Look at me,

27:12.464 --> 27:14.100
using my superpowers for good.

27:14.133 --> 27:15.935
I feel like the Dark Knight.

27:15.968 --> 27:17.804
Don't get carried away.

27:17.837 --> 27:20.006
So we good? Can I go home?

27:20.039 --> 27:22.842
-That's up to the judge.
-I just saved the day.

27:22.875 --> 27:24.677
Doesn't that make up for the bad
I did this morning?

27:24.711 --> 27:29.148
Listen, I'll write a nice letter
on your behalf to the judge.

27:29.181 --> 27:31.150
Good deeds may get you
into heaven,

27:31.183 --> 27:33.152
but the law is the law, honey,
and once I put you

27:33.185 --> 27:35.888
in the back of my squad car,
there's no getting out.

27:35.922 --> 27:39.058
Thank you for helping me
and that man today.

27:52.004 --> 27:56.575
The next time you get
a chance to do the wrong thing,

27:56.608 --> 27:58.878
think about how bad
you feel right now,

27:58.911 --> 28:02.949
and how good it felt
to do the right thing.

28:14.593 --> 28:16.328
BOBBY:
Watch your step, guys.

28:16.362 --> 28:17.764
L.A. Fire and Rescue!

28:19.231 --> 28:20.466
MAN (faintly):
Can you hear me?

28:22.401 --> 28:24.837
CHIMNEY:
Is anybody down here?

28:24.871 --> 28:27.006
-Hello?
-HEN: Bobby.

28:27.039 --> 28:29.041
Yeah?

28:37.416 --> 28:38.985
All right.

28:42.588 --> 28:45.557
All right, guys,
let's keep going.

28:45.591 --> 28:47.593
L.A. Fire and Rescue.

28:47.626 --> 28:51.297
-CHIMNEY: Anybody down here?
-COACH: Right here!

28:51.330 --> 28:53.032
All right, we got a voice
over there, guys. Let's go.

28:53.065 --> 28:54.901
-You need any help?
-All good.

28:54.934 --> 28:57.269
There's a kid
maybe 50 feet back.

28:57.303 --> 28:59.605
-Needs EMTs bad.
-HEN: Is it a little girl?

28:59.638 --> 29:01.073
No, a young
African-American kid.

29:03.575 --> 29:05.912
Fire and Rescue. Hello?

29:05.945 --> 29:08.047
COACH:
Yeah. Right here!

29:08.080 --> 29:10.049
Thank God, man, he's stuck!

29:10.082 --> 29:12.418
BOBBY:
All right, we're coming.

29:15.121 --> 29:17.790
All right, guys,
the floor is out.

29:17.824 --> 29:19.325
It's stable.

29:26.132 --> 29:27.366
(young man groans)

29:30.502 --> 29:32.438
Hey, he's stuck. Right here.

29:32.471 --> 29:34.006
BOBBY:
All right, help is on the way.

29:34.040 --> 29:35.607
-(groans)
-They're here, man.

29:39.812 --> 29:41.013
Stick with me, right here.

29:41.047 --> 29:42.815
What's your name, son?

29:42.849 --> 29:45.918
-Jeff.
-Jeff? Hold on.

29:45.952 --> 29:48.620
Hang tight.
Jeff, we're right here.

29:48.654 --> 29:50.656
BOBBY:
Listen, you already try

29:50.689 --> 29:52.524
and move some debris,
see if you can pull him free?

29:52.558 --> 29:54.593
FIREFIGHTER:
The second we touched the beam,

29:54.626 --> 29:55.995
the whole megillah above
started shifting.

29:56.028 --> 29:57.363
BOBBY:
That's what I was afraid of.

29:57.396 --> 29:59.031
All right, guys,
this debris is holding up

29:59.065 --> 30:00.466
this section of ceiling.

30:00.499 --> 30:02.835
If we try and pull this
out of the way,

30:02.869 --> 30:04.670
this whole area could cave in.

30:04.703 --> 30:06.472
(Jeff groans)

30:06.505 --> 30:07.706
HEN:
You're gonna be all right.

30:07.739 --> 30:09.475
Gonna be all right.

30:09.508 --> 30:10.977
HEN:
Just gonna stabilize you.

30:11.010 --> 30:13.145
I-I can't move it, Coach.

30:13.179 --> 30:15.147
-How bad is it?
-COACH:
Hey, bones heal. All right?

30:15.181 --> 30:18.450
You'll be all right. All right?
Just a little setback.

30:18.484 --> 30:20.352
You remember Paul George?
Gordon Hayward? Huh?

30:20.386 --> 30:23.622
I'm starting to think different
about this California school.

30:23.655 --> 30:25.557
Maybe it's not the place for me.

30:25.591 --> 30:28.027
Yeah, Jeff has every
division one college

30:28.060 --> 30:29.695
in the country
recruiting him right now.

30:29.728 --> 30:32.198
Sir, this firefighter is gonna
lead you out of here.

30:32.231 --> 30:33.732
No, screw that,
I'm staying, all right?

30:33.765 --> 30:35.701
This kid is a son to me.

30:35.734 --> 30:37.736
-All right? He's in my charge.
-BOBBY: Okay, we need to focus

30:37.769 --> 30:39.805
all of our attention on Jeff
right now.

30:39.838 --> 30:41.707
We can't be worried about
your safety, too. Now go.

30:43.009 --> 30:46.012
I'm good, Coach.

30:46.045 --> 30:48.580
Heart of a champion.

30:51.683 --> 30:53.685
I love you, kid.

31:00.226 --> 31:02.962
He's coming home with us.

31:07.033 --> 31:08.700
(grunts)

31:08.734 --> 31:11.270
-Easy, easy.
-(Jeff groans)

31:21.047 --> 31:23.049
BOBBY:
What do we got, Hen?

31:23.082 --> 31:26.685
Tibia and fibula are crushed.
Don't think the debris cut

31:26.718 --> 31:29.788
through
any major arteries, though.

31:29.821 --> 31:32.724
Okay, kid, I'm not gonna
sugarcoat it.

31:32.758 --> 31:34.126
You're in a bad spot here.

31:34.160 --> 31:36.295
We have two choices.

31:36.328 --> 31:38.264
The first guarantees
you get out of here,

31:38.297 --> 31:39.765
the second carries more risk.

31:39.798 --> 31:41.633
What's the guaranteed way?

31:44.270 --> 31:46.772
We get a trauma surgeon in here
and we cut you free.

31:46.805 --> 31:50.209
Free?
You mean from my leg?

31:50.242 --> 31:51.577
Yeah.

31:51.610 --> 31:54.246
Listen.

31:54.280 --> 31:56.882
We'd put you out.
You wouldn't feel any pain.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.284
You'd wake up in the hospital
safe and sound.

31:58.317 --> 32:00.452
Without my leg. No way.

32:00.486 --> 32:02.254
I'd rather die here.
What's the other option?

32:02.288 --> 32:03.990
Well, we shore up
this pocket we're in

32:04.023 --> 32:07.126
and then we get an air bag
to lift up

32:07.159 --> 32:09.328
that beam that's pinning
you down and we pull you free.

32:09.361 --> 32:11.397
Yeah, yeah, do that.
Air bags and all that.

32:11.430 --> 32:13.565
All right, listen, I know that
sounds simple, but it's not

32:13.599 --> 32:15.501
because this debris
is holding up this ceiling

32:15.534 --> 32:17.269
and if it starts to give way,

32:17.303 --> 32:19.938
this whole side of the
restaurant could collapse.

32:19.972 --> 32:22.908
Me and my team, we're gonna
be able to get out of here.

32:22.941 --> 32:25.111
I don't think you will.

32:25.144 --> 32:28.981
All right, man, you got parents,
a girlfriend.

32:29.015 --> 32:30.316
And they're gonna love you

32:30.349 --> 32:31.917
whether you play basketball
or not.

32:31.950 --> 32:36.488
I know. I know they do,
but I worked so hard.

32:36.522 --> 32:39.325
(cries)

32:39.358 --> 32:42.161
This is my dream, my whole life.

32:44.963 --> 32:50.202
Look... I may be able
to live without my leg,

32:50.236 --> 32:52.038
but I don't know if I can live

32:52.071 --> 32:53.939
knowing I could have
saved it and didn't.

32:53.972 --> 32:56.542
All right. We're committed.

32:56.575 --> 32:58.810
We're gonna get him out of here.

32:58.844 --> 33:00.946
Let's shore this up.
Get an air bag.

33:00.979 --> 33:02.348
Copy that.

33:10.489 --> 33:11.957
As first responders
continue the painstaking task

33:11.990 --> 33:14.526
of searching every floor
of the hotel's 14 stories,

33:14.560 --> 33:16.728
experts fear that
a significant aftershock

33:16.762 --> 33:18.964
could result
in a sudden collapse.

33:18.997 --> 33:21.533
ANCHOR: Well, we all remember
how many brave first responders

33:21.567 --> 33:24.803
lost their lives on 9/11 when
those buildings came down.

33:24.836 --> 33:26.705
And that's the image that haunts
the scene today, Martha,

33:26.738 --> 33:28.740
but that's not stopping
the brave firefighters

33:28.774 --> 33:32.211
and rescue workers who continue
to comb for survivors.

33:32.244 --> 33:33.545
So much for the little
training cruise.

33:33.579 --> 33:35.047
Ladies and gents,
listen up, please.

33:35.081 --> 33:37.883
You've all completed
a significant portion

33:37.916 --> 33:39.085
of your training.

33:39.118 --> 33:40.319
The rest is gonna be
a crash course.

33:40.352 --> 33:42.388
All we're gonna be asking
from you today

33:42.421 --> 33:43.922
is to basically roll calls.

33:43.955 --> 33:46.192
More than 50% of what
we're getting right now

33:46.225 --> 33:48.994
is nuisance calls,
nonemergencies.

33:49.027 --> 33:51.263
People telling us that
they felt an earthquake,

33:51.297 --> 33:53.232
wanting to know when
their power will be restored.

33:53.265 --> 33:56.735
Your job today will be
to keep the lines clear.

33:56.768 --> 33:58.704
What if it's a real emergency?

33:58.737 --> 34:00.406
If you think you can help,
then do it.

34:00.439 --> 34:02.541
If not, send it up the chain
and one of us will.

34:02.574 --> 34:04.276
All right?

34:06.745 --> 34:08.347
My brother is a firefighter

34:08.380 --> 34:10.182
and I think he might be
in that building.

34:10.216 --> 34:12.618
We all have people
we love out there.

34:12.651 --> 34:17.456
The best thing we can do
for them right now is our job.

34:36.275 --> 34:38.644
(metal creaks and groans)

34:42.648 --> 34:45.050
EDDIE:
It's only six flights.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.653
Not exactly Mount Everest.

34:47.686 --> 34:50.289
(panting): Yeah,
except Everest might not

34:50.322 --> 34:52.791
tip over and crush you
like a bug.

34:54.493 --> 34:57.563
You good, Buck?

34:57.596 --> 35:00.932
-Yeah.
-Let's keep going.

35:11.510 --> 35:13.845
If you're not essential,
get clear.

35:20.519 --> 35:23.922
Okay. As soon as this thing
inflates enough

35:23.955 --> 35:26.258
to pull him out,
let's get him out of here.

35:26.292 --> 35:29.661
-You ready, Jeff?
-JEFF: Yeah.

35:29.695 --> 35:33.599
But if things go wrong,
leave me and save yourselves.

35:33.632 --> 35:36.502
This is my choice to try this.

35:36.535 --> 35:39.205
All four of us
are getting out of here.

35:39.238 --> 35:41.273
That's right,
with all eight of our legs.

35:41.307 --> 35:43.509
Now, Jeff, Hen gave you
some morphine,

35:43.542 --> 35:45.611
but when we move you it's still
gonna hurt like hell.

35:45.644 --> 35:46.678
Are you ready?

35:46.712 --> 35:48.747
I'm ready.

35:50.349 --> 35:52.484
Come on, we got this.

35:52.518 --> 35:54.786
Yeah, come on, we the champs.

35:54.820 --> 35:57.055
Yeah, we can do this, a'ight?

35:57.088 --> 35:58.624
Let's go. We the champs.
Heart of a champion.

35:58.657 --> 36:00.125
-We got this, we got this.
-Heart of a champion.

36:00.158 --> 36:01.460
-Heart of a champion.
-Let's do it!
-All right.

36:01.493 --> 36:03.161
-Just like that. We got it.
-Let's go.

36:03.195 --> 36:06.064
In three... two...

36:06.097 --> 36:11.303
one.

36:11.337 --> 36:12.704
* Wading in the water

36:12.738 --> 36:14.573
* Just trying not to crack...

36:16.208 --> 36:18.277
(Jeff groaning)

36:19.611 --> 36:22.248
He's not moving.

36:22.281 --> 36:24.283
* Yeah, that's where we are,
babe... *

36:26.585 --> 36:29.821
All right. Cap.
Cap, it's not gonna hold.

36:29.855 --> 36:31.357
-It's not gonna hold.
-Just a little bit more.

36:31.390 --> 36:32.924
Just a little bit more.
See if you can get him out.

36:32.958 --> 36:34.059
Can you get him out?

36:34.092 --> 36:35.827
(indistinct shouting)

36:35.861 --> 36:37.195
-Go! -Go!

36:37.229 --> 36:38.430
I got him! I got him!

36:38.464 --> 36:41.433
(Jeff groaning)

36:41.467 --> 36:43.435
BOBBY: Get me dual grade.
Watch the tip.

36:43.469 --> 36:44.570
You're doing great.

36:44.603 --> 36:45.904
Good job, champ, come on.

36:45.937 --> 36:47.506
Heart of a champion, right?
You're doing great.

36:47.539 --> 36:49.708
You're doing great.

36:49.741 --> 36:50.876
HEN:
Come on, guys, get him up.

36:50.909 --> 36:53.178
And on me, on three.
One, two, three.

36:53.211 --> 36:55.681
-(Jeff groans)
-All right, easy.

36:55.714 --> 36:58.216
You're doing great, champ,
doing great.

36:58.250 --> 36:59.618
-Thank you.
-All right.

36:59.651 --> 37:01.787
-Easy. Easy.
-All right, easy.

37:01.820 --> 37:04.089
-All right, Chim, you follow.
-Copy.

37:04.122 --> 37:05.624
HEN:
Hang in there, Jeff!

37:05.657 --> 37:07.559
-You got him?
-BOBBY: All right, Trauma,

37:07.593 --> 37:09.595
he's coming your way,
make sure he keeps that leg.

37:11.897 --> 37:13.532
HEN:
Come on.

37:13.565 --> 37:15.301
BOBBY:
Come on, Hen.

37:18.337 --> 37:20.439
(grunts)

37:20.472 --> 37:22.474
Kat!

37:24.109 --> 37:25.511
Kat!

37:32.150 --> 37:34.152
*

37:37.656 --> 37:40.326
(grunts)

37:42.594 --> 37:44.229
All right.

37:44.262 --> 37:45.731
You ready?

37:45.764 --> 37:47.098
Yeah, on three.

37:47.132 --> 37:50.536
One, two, three.

37:53.972 --> 37:57.142
(grunting)

37:57.175 --> 38:00.512
EDDIE:
Hello! Hello!

38:00.546 --> 38:02.180
LAFD!

38:02.213 --> 38:04.616
-ALI: In here! In here!
-HARLOW: In here!

38:04.650 --> 38:06.352
-ALI: Please.
-This one here.

38:06.385 --> 38:09.321
(grunting)

38:09.355 --> 38:11.357
(grunts)

38:17.729 --> 38:19.598
All right.

38:19.631 --> 38:22.534
In you go.

38:24.403 --> 38:27.272
Hello! LAFD!

38:27.305 --> 38:29.341
-We're in here!
-In here!

38:36.515 --> 38:39.385
-(Ali whimpers) Oh, God.
-(grunts)

38:39.418 --> 38:40.952
Thank God. Please, please,
get me out of here.

38:40.986 --> 38:43.154
Whoa, whoa, ma'am, I-I need you
to just sit tight.

38:43.188 --> 38:44.289
I will come and I will get you.

38:44.322 --> 38:46.558
-Okay?
-Okay.

38:46.592 --> 38:49.194
HARLOW: Uh, no offense, but I
think this might be a situation

38:49.227 --> 38:52.030
where "women and children first"
does not apply.

38:52.063 --> 38:53.565
Did you just say "no offense"?

38:53.599 --> 38:55.467
Everything about you
is offensive.

38:55.501 --> 38:57.536
-First date?
-Yeah, God, he wishes.

38:57.569 --> 39:00.305
Amazingly, that sweaty, fat,
pock-marked pig

39:00.338 --> 39:02.140
is married with five kids.

39:02.173 --> 39:04.309
Didn't stop him from asking me
to shower with him.

39:04.342 --> 39:07.145
Man, have you not watched the
news at all over the past year?

39:07.178 --> 39:08.980
-EDDIE: All right, you're good.
-BUCK: All right.

39:09.014 --> 39:10.348
Seriously,
catch up with the times.

39:10.382 --> 39:12.818
HARLOW: All right, fine,
so I'm a dinosaur.

39:12.851 --> 39:14.920
A forgotten relic
of a forgotten age.

39:14.953 --> 39:17.723
For God's sake, just get me
the hell out of here.

39:17.756 --> 39:19.558
Hurry.

39:19.591 --> 39:21.693
-I'm gonna throw you a rope,
okay?
-Okay.

39:21.727 --> 39:22.894
I'm gonna need you to try
and secure yourself.

39:22.928 --> 39:23.995
-Okay.
-You ready?

39:24.029 --> 39:25.030
-Yeah.
-All right.

39:27.899 --> 39:30.502
-(glass creaking)
-Don't move!

39:30.536 --> 39:32.704
-(grunts)
-Don't breathe.

39:37.375 --> 39:39.511
(indistinct chatter)

39:39.545 --> 39:41.346
Wait a second. I remember him.
I remember him.

39:41.379 --> 39:43.048
He was in the restaurant.

39:43.081 --> 39:45.917
-I remember him. Go ask.
-Did you find our daughter?

39:45.951 --> 39:47.753
Did you find Kat? She was
on the same floor as him.

39:47.786 --> 39:49.054
We've still got people in there.

39:49.087 --> 39:50.956
They're looking for her
right now.

39:50.989 --> 39:52.257
-Somebody has to have seen her.
-She was on
the same floor as him.

39:52.290 --> 39:53.592
Can you tell me
what she was wearing?

39:53.625 --> 39:54.760
-She was wearing a pink shirt.
-Pink.

39:54.793 --> 39:56.462
-It has ruffles on it.
-Yes.

39:56.495 --> 39:57.929
-She has light blue jeans on.
-Okay, sir, what kind of shirt?

39:57.963 --> 39:59.431
-Um, I don't know.
-Button up?

39:59.465 --> 40:00.766
-It was like a, like a neck.
-Yes.

40:00.799 --> 40:02.267
Okay, what color were her shoes?

40:02.300 --> 40:03.602
-Uh, purple shoes.
-Pink.

40:03.635 --> 40:05.904
-Pink? Were they pink?
-Purple-pink.

40:07.338 --> 40:09.575
All right, thanks.
That is her shoe.

40:09.608 --> 40:10.742
Parents said she was on her way
to the restroom

40:10.776 --> 40:11.877
when the quake hit.

40:11.910 --> 40:13.144
Restrooms are cleared, Cap.

40:13.178 --> 40:14.913
HEN: Oh, my God.
She could be anywhere.

40:14.946 --> 40:17.082
She could be wandering about,
trapped under this debris.

40:17.115 --> 40:20.218
BOBBY: Let's get USAR back
in here with thermal cams.

40:20.251 --> 40:22.253
-Hurry.
-(glass cracking)

40:22.287 --> 40:26.658
Hurry, it's starting to crack.

40:26.692 --> 40:29.160
All right,
I'm gonna come around to you.

40:29.194 --> 40:32.631
You need to stay totally still,
sir.

40:32.664 --> 40:34.265
Don't even talk.

40:36.935 --> 40:39.270
*

40:45.844 --> 40:46.945
221, you're far from home.

40:46.978 --> 40:49.014
Well, all hands on deck, right?

40:49.047 --> 40:51.517
(Hen chuckles)

40:51.550 --> 40:53.184
Anything?

40:53.218 --> 40:54.953
FIREFIGHTER:
No, not yet.

40:54.986 --> 40:56.955
HEN:
Kat!

40:56.988 --> 40:58.924
Kat!

40:58.957 --> 41:00.826
Oh, God.

41:00.859 --> 41:02.928
Please don't let this be
the end.

41:02.961 --> 41:06.665
All right. I'm gonna tie this
webbing around you,

41:06.698 --> 41:08.534
and we're gonna get you away
from the glass.

41:08.567 --> 41:10.035
(whimpers)

41:10.068 --> 41:11.970
Okay. Okay.

41:12.003 --> 41:14.706
-(rumbling)
-Oh! Oh, God!
-(Ali screams)

41:14.740 --> 41:16.007
Aftershock! Aftershock!

41:16.041 --> 41:18.810
-Help me!
-HARLOW: Oh, God! Oh, God!

41:18.844 --> 41:20.311
BOBBY:
Chim, get outta there!

41:20.345 --> 41:21.446
Get back! Get back! Fall back!

41:21.479 --> 41:23.849
Chim, come on, Chim.

41:23.882 --> 41:27.719
-Hen, get clear!
-(Hen screams)

41:27.753 --> 41:28.754
Hen!

41:30.856 --> 41:33.859
(Hen screaming)

41:33.892 --> 41:35.627
-Hen!
-Hen! Hen!

41:35.661 --> 41:37.529
-Hen!
-Hen!

41:38.730 --> 41:40.699
ALI:
Oh, no, my God!

41:40.732 --> 41:43.201
-Oh, God.
-Hold on! Hold on!

41:45.604 --> 41:48.807
-No, don't!
-(Harlow screams)

41:48.840 --> 41:50.408
(gasps)

41:50.441 --> 41:51.476
(heavy thud)

41:51.509 --> 41:53.011

41:54.212 --> 41:55.380
Hey! Hey! Hey!

41:56.181 --> 41:58.183
(panting)

42:00.719 --> 42:03.388
(Ali screaming)

42:06.124 --> 42:07.392
Give me your other hand.

42:12.230 --> 42:14.399
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

42:56.507 --> 42:58.009
You've answered the call
on 9-1-1.

42:58.043 --> 43:00.278
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

43:02.347 --> 43:04.650
I think my favorite scenes--

43:04.683 --> 43:08.319
Well, the ones I'm most proud of
are probably the medical scenes.

43:08.353 --> 43:10.756
MAN: Two of my favorite scenes
take place in the OR,

43:10.789 --> 43:12.557
'cause the OR's such a great
place to shoot.

43:12.590 --> 43:14.192
My favorite scene
in season one.

43:16.427 --> 43:19.264
One of the patients we've been
following throughout the course
of the season,

43:19.297 --> 43:21.432
-she codes.
-(monitor beeping)

43:21.466 --> 43:25.403
-Lily.
-Conrad goes to save her
and is unable to save her.

43:25.436 --> 43:27.338
Ready. Clear.

43:27.372 --> 43:30.341
CZUCHRY: It really kind of
culminates the beginning
of the first half

43:30.375 --> 43:31.542
of the season,

43:31.576 --> 43:34.746
with Conrad
and that loss of Lily,

43:34.780 --> 43:37.749
of Conrad failing
and being unable
to save that patient,

43:37.783 --> 43:41.953
that pushes us emotionally
into the end of season one.

43:41.987 --> 43:43.288
One of my favorite scenes

43:43.321 --> 43:45.223
was the central line scene
that we did in the pilot,

43:45.256 --> 43:49.094
because it was the first scene
that all of us were 100 percent
working together

43:49.127 --> 43:50.896
to save this one patient.

43:50.929 --> 43:54.800
Okay. Keep going.
So far you haven't killed her.

43:54.833 --> 43:57.435
When we're doing
these choreographies,

43:57.468 --> 44:00.739
having to say these crazy words,
doing this dance together,

44:00.772 --> 44:03.975
I guess they're the most
difficult, but probably
the most rewarding

44:04.009 --> 44:05.543
when we accomplish them.

44:05.576 --> 44:07.545
What next?

44:07.578 --> 44:10.315
When her pressure levels out,
wean her off the Norepi

44:10.348 --> 44:12.250
and then drown her in fluids.

44:13.451 --> 44:16.221
Congratulations.
We just busted your cherry.

44:16.254 --> 44:18.790
WARNER:
I think the very first episode,

44:18.824 --> 44:21.059
when the Raptor comes in
to just observe,

44:21.092 --> 44:24.395
and he ends up
taking over the surgery.

44:24.429 --> 44:26.564
Hey, let's get him
on cardiac bypass.

44:26.597 --> 44:30.769
Whoa. Bypass?
I guess that's the way
a trauma surgeon thinks.

44:30.802 --> 44:34.305
You know, you wouldn't need
a bypass if you knew how to
do heart surgery like me.

44:34.339 --> 44:38.109
It was just fun because
I get to be as obnoxious
as I want to be,

44:38.143 --> 44:40.846
which I don't get a chance
to be very often in real life.

44:40.879 --> 44:42.580
Mina, do you have
an opinion on this?

44:42.613 --> 44:45.516
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You're asking your resident
for confirmation?

44:45.550 --> 44:47.685
(chuckling)
Dawg, you are the attending.

44:47.719 --> 44:49.988
Definitely, one of my favorite
scenes

44:50.021 --> 44:52.290
is from episode five
of season one.

44:52.323 --> 44:55.460
Literally, me running around
to all the different OR's

44:55.493 --> 44:57.863
and checking in
on the different procedures

44:57.896 --> 44:59.597
and sweating.

44:59.630 --> 45:02.868
It was really exciting
to see Mina kind of
under pressure that way.

45:05.536 --> 45:07.105
Yeah, it was a lot of fun.

45:07.138 --> 45:09.674
Christine's crashing here
in OR 3.

45:09.707 --> 45:11.309
-You're kidding.
-I don't do that.
