WEBVTT

01:16.813 --> 01:18.975
- My turn.
- No, give it to me.

01:19.248 --> 01:22.116
- No, it's mine!
- It's mine, give it to me.

01:32.995 --> 01:34.554
- Hey!
- Run, Jimmy!

01:34.797 --> 01:39.030
What the hell are you doing,
you little vermin? Look at my door!

01:39.335 --> 01:42.328
Get the hell out of here,
you little bastards!

01:44.107 --> 01:46.201
My, oh, my.

02:03.192 --> 02:05.286
Hey, killer, what's the count now?

02:05.528 --> 02:09.727
You'll be happy to know
that I have slain 73--

02:10.333 --> 02:13.735
Seventy-four of the enemy
thus far today...

02:13.970 --> 02:17.805
...besting my record by this time
of day yesterday by four.

02:19.609 --> 02:22.238
- You got another swatter?
- No, sir.

02:22.478 --> 02:25.642
And I refuse any offers of help.

02:25.882 --> 02:28.044
This is a private feud.

02:29.552 --> 02:32.750
Thanks for the pull, Bob.
Here you are.

02:32.989 --> 02:35.458
Good as new.
Use it on the next one.

02:41.664 --> 02:43.758
What can I do for you, friend?

02:44.000 --> 02:47.630
I thought you might know of a job,
even a temporary job.

02:47.870 --> 02:49.839
Let me let you in on a little secret.

02:50.072 --> 02:55.204
I did know of a job one time around here.
That was about eight months ago.

02:55.444 --> 03:00.712
- Seven men lined up to get it.
- I should have stayed on that train.

03:01.150 --> 03:05.645
- When's the next one?
- They've got a very scientific schedule.

03:05.888 --> 03:10.553
It's figured in terms of miles
and weight and steam pressures...

03:10.793 --> 03:16.164
...and circumference of the wheel and
revolutions per minute. It's very precise.

03:16.532 --> 03:19.297
Can't you just tell me
when the train comes in?

03:19.569 --> 03:23.028
- That is one secret I do not know.
- Oh, hell.

03:35.384 --> 03:39.321
How'd you like to make $3.10?

03:39.555 --> 03:41.387
$3.10?

03:43.426 --> 03:48.592
- What do I have to do?
- That place over there belongs to me...

03:48.831 --> 03:52.632
...and I'm thinking it don't look right.
That door...

03:52.868 --> 03:56.669
...sticks out like a sore thumb.
I want you to repaint it.

03:56.973 --> 03:59.670
I'd do it myself,
but I'm feeling plumb lazy.

03:59.976 --> 04:03.037
All I gotta do is paint that door
and you'll pay me $3?

04:03.279 --> 04:04.474
Yes, sir.

04:04.714 --> 04:08.617
There is one thing.
The fella I'm renting that place to...

04:08.851 --> 04:11.480
...he's kind of peculiar,
off in the head.

04:12.188 --> 04:16.091
He might complain.
Thinks he owns the place.

04:16.591 --> 04:20.392
- You just pay him no mind.
- I ain't looking for no trouble.

04:20.663 --> 04:23.963
How about I give you the money now?

04:24.367 --> 04:26.302
Now, that's a different story.

04:26.569 --> 04:28.333
There you go.

04:32.608 --> 04:37.410
I ain't heard a word.
I was in the back the whole time.

05:06.876 --> 05:10.472
- Monte.
- Shorty. Chet.

05:12.915 --> 05:15.851
- What are you doing?
- I'm painting the door.

05:16.085 --> 05:19.522
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Look at my door!

05:19.889 --> 05:24.190
- I got a job to do, mister.
- Get out! Get out! It's my door!

05:24.427 --> 05:26.896
- I'm a lawyer!
- You're a lunatic!

05:27.730 --> 05:30.928
Get off my porch, you stupid clod!

05:31.167 --> 05:34.399
Who you calling a clod, pig-face?

05:35.805 --> 05:37.433
No, no!

05:42.311 --> 05:43.677
Stop!

05:44.447 --> 05:46.848
This is your doing, ain't it?

07:37.493 --> 07:39.462
You could break a leg doing that.

07:39.929 --> 07:42.194
I got two.

08:17.233 --> 08:19.031
Let's go get paid.

08:19.335 --> 08:20.462
Yes, sir.

08:43.092 --> 08:46.494
- Can you do that, Monte?
- Yep.

08:49.732 --> 08:51.598
Well, let's see you do it.

08:51.867 --> 08:53.836
- I just did.
- What you talking about?

08:54.103 --> 08:56.629
You got off your horse,
I got off mine.

08:56.906 --> 09:01.276
You're standing on the ground,
I'm standing too. Ain't that right, Chet?

09:01.544 --> 09:03.012
Yep.

09:06.482 --> 09:09.008
Looks like we all did it, Shorty.

09:23.532 --> 09:27.128
- Afternoon, Mr. Rollins.
- Afternoon, Mrs. Wilder.

09:34.209 --> 09:35.472
The hardware widow.

09:38.080 --> 09:41.073
- What a lovely caboose.
- I'd like to hammer a nail in there.

09:41.317 --> 09:42.717
Mind your tongue!

09:43.052 --> 09:46.147
- What'd I say?
- Ain't you never read the Bible?

09:46.388 --> 09:49.358
I don't remember nothing about
no hardware ladies in it.

09:49.625 --> 09:51.651
I'm going for a drink.

09:52.394 --> 09:56.195
- What does the Bible say about widows?
- To treat them kindly.

09:56.432 --> 10:00.802
Hammering a nail into her might be
the kindest thing in the world for her.

10:01.036 --> 10:03.972
Says something about being respectful too.

10:07.309 --> 10:09.710
- Hey. Howdy.
- Hey there.

10:10.679 --> 10:12.705
How you doing here?

10:16.151 --> 10:17.312
I'm buying.

10:18.120 --> 10:19.418
Thanks, Chet.

10:19.688 --> 10:21.680
Yeah, thanks, Chet.

10:23.292 --> 10:25.921
- Monte.
- Henry.

10:26.929 --> 10:31.697
Here's $2. Keep it for me.
I want to be able to eat while I'm in town.

10:31.934 --> 10:34.460
Don't give it back even when
you're begging for it?

10:34.770 --> 10:36.204
I never beg, Henry.

10:36.472 --> 10:40.204
Even when you threaten to climb
across and twist my head off?

10:40.876 --> 10:42.208
Especially then.

10:46.615 --> 10:49.107
- I sure feel the chill.
- Winter's coming.

10:49.385 --> 10:51.911
What do you miss most in winter, Shorty?

10:52.187 --> 10:53.655
- The ladies.
- Ladies?

10:53.889 --> 10:56.654
- Yeah.
- I heard you had such a fast fuse...

10:56.892 --> 10:59.293
...they hardly knew you came to call.

11:00.729 --> 11:03.289
They're all chipping in
to return your money.

11:03.532 --> 11:05.125
That's it.

11:07.369 --> 11:11.067
Why did you do that? Especially since
we won't see him all winter.

11:11.373 --> 11:14.172
- You know how he is.
- Too short-fused is how he is.

11:14.410 --> 11:19.110
- You don't have to keep needling him.
- Needling people's what I do.

11:28.791 --> 11:33.161
- I guess I'll go back to the saloon.
- You know where I'll be.

11:56.919 --> 11:59.013
You had your hair cut.

11:59.254 --> 12:01.689
I didn't want to waste any time.

12:32.087 --> 12:36.525
- Good evening, Mr. Rollins.
- Evening to you, Mrs. Wilder.

12:39.428 --> 12:41.590
Such pretty flowers.

12:41.830 --> 12:43.924
Please, come in.

12:54.676 --> 12:57.805
You really love this life. Don't you, Monte?

12:58.347 --> 13:00.111
Yes, I do.

13:01.250 --> 13:03.810
I dislike winter very much.

13:04.586 --> 13:06.748
They didn't have winters
where you grew up?

13:06.989 --> 13:10.153
Sure, they had winter,
big, cold, snowy winter.

13:10.526 --> 13:13.894
But I was a little girl then.
It was fun to play in the snow.

13:14.129 --> 13:16.826
- And now?
- I still like playing in the snow...

13:17.132 --> 13:21.035
...but around here when there is snow,
there is no one to play with.

13:21.904 --> 13:24.373
Now, that's a sad story.

13:24.973 --> 13:27.238
It is a sad story.

14:06.081 --> 14:09.813
- What are we doing here, Monte?
- We're cowboying, Chet.

14:10.052 --> 14:11.748
It's a hell of a life.

14:12.054 --> 14:16.651
A cowboy can ride down to Texas
and up to Canada and back again...

14:16.892 --> 14:19.919
...and get paid for it. Hell of a life.

14:20.162 --> 14:22.722
Yeah. A hell of a life.

14:22.965 --> 14:25.833
And this ain't a good stove.

14:27.236 --> 14:31.867
And there ain't any more strays gonna
get past here because they're all frozen.

14:32.174 --> 14:35.872
- Worst winter I can remember.
- I seen worse.

14:36.511 --> 14:38.707
You'll feel different in the spring.

14:39.014 --> 14:42.212
I'll be happy if I can feel
anything in the spring.

14:42.885 --> 14:46.720
This heifer ain't gonna last long
unless we mother her up.

15:26.328 --> 15:30.493
- You ever been in love, Monte?
- Nope.

15:31.767 --> 15:34.202
I've been a cowboy all my life.

15:38.974 --> 15:41.102
It might be kind of nice.

15:41.410 --> 15:44.471
Good bottle of whiskey
might be kind of nice too.

15:46.882 --> 15:48.817
I take it back.

15:49.251 --> 15:53.552
I was in love once with this
lovely gal in El Paso.

15:53.855 --> 15:57.656
I met her in a cantina.
She brought me food...

15:57.893 --> 16:01.728
...and when I looked up into her eyes,
I just knew.

16:01.964 --> 16:06.402
You know what I'm saying?
I just knew that it was gonna be my night.

16:06.668 --> 16:08.933
You've been telling me this all winter.

16:09.171 --> 16:12.164
- You brought it up.
- I brung up love three months ago...

16:12.407 --> 16:14.467
...and all you've talked about is sex!

16:15.010 --> 16:17.309
- Same thing.
- No, it ain't.

16:17.546 --> 16:22.314
You're certainly entitled to your opinion,
but I happen to see it different.

16:42.371 --> 16:44.431
Can you do that, Chet?

16:45.774 --> 16:47.242
Yeah.

16:48.243 --> 16:50.906
But give me a little time to get dumber.

16:53.648 --> 16:55.082
Chet. Monte.

16:55.350 --> 16:57.216
- Brennan.
- Howdy, Mr. Brennan.

16:57.452 --> 16:58.681
What's going on here?

16:58.920 --> 17:02.550
These boys looking for work.
Winter wiped out most of the ranches.

17:03.091 --> 17:04.992
Including the Cross Bar?

17:05.727 --> 17:07.319
Yes, sir.

17:07.729 --> 17:10.425
Old man Hendricks left that for you.

17:10.732 --> 17:14.635
This is a month's pay.
We were up there all winter.

17:14.903 --> 17:19.272
- Plus we got $15 coming for three wolves.
- He could've left us nothing.

17:19.508 --> 17:22.876
- What happened to Slash Y, Mr. Brennan?
- It's gone.

17:23.111 --> 17:27.070
A company called Consolidated Cattle
bought me out, along with the rest.

17:27.549 --> 17:31.281
- Who are they?
- A pack of accountants, as far as I can tell.

17:31.520 --> 17:34.752
Big Eastern money.
They asked me to stay on and run it.

17:34.990 --> 17:38.722
- Range manager is what they call me.
- Accountants.

17:38.960 --> 17:43.421
They want to keep the Slash Y running
until they know what to do with...

17:43.732 --> 17:46.566
...the other holdings.
They're gonna put up the money.

17:46.802 --> 17:48.862
Capital is what they call that.

17:49.771 --> 17:52.866
- Cowhands are a dime a dozen right now.
- Yes, sir.

17:53.175 --> 17:57.909
But I'm fixing to build something
real special. I'm only hiring the very best.

17:58.213 --> 18:00.682
How many horses you need broke?

18:02.284 --> 18:04.810
Already got a bronc stomper, Monte.

18:06.555 --> 18:11.493
I'm in a position to offer you boys
what you might call a regular job.

18:11.927 --> 18:15.193
- How's that sound?
- Awful.

18:16.965 --> 18:20.231
Bronc stomping's
a young man's game, Monte.

18:20.469 --> 18:23.132
You ought to think real hard on this one.

18:24.606 --> 18:28.407
It don't take real hard thinking
on my part. Count me in.

18:31.480 --> 18:32.470
Who's cook?

18:33.048 --> 18:35.643
Skimpy Eagens from the Flying O.

18:37.119 --> 18:41.113
- Hear he can cook.
- Yes, sir, he can cook.

18:45.093 --> 18:48.359
I ain't doing nothing I can't do
from a horse.

18:48.730 --> 18:50.961
I'm not asking you to, Monte.

18:55.604 --> 18:57.800
I'll be looking for you.

19:16.124 --> 19:17.990
Damn winter.

19:30.772 --> 19:33.367
- Henry.
- Monte.

19:43.952 --> 19:45.511
You need a haircut.

19:49.090 --> 19:51.787
Don't be messing with my hair in here.

19:56.531 --> 19:58.124
Well?

19:59.167 --> 20:00.726
Well?

20:03.838 --> 20:05.431
Let's go.

20:06.408 --> 20:10.004
What is it exactly
that you have in mind?

20:10.612 --> 20:12.376
I don't know.

20:13.682 --> 20:15.241
Dinner?

20:17.085 --> 20:20.112
- Well, hell, countess--
- Don't call me countess.

20:20.555 --> 20:23.150
I thought all you foreign ladies
was countesses.

20:23.425 --> 20:28.557
Just because a woman is a foreigner
doesn't make her a countess.

20:29.965 --> 20:31.228
Anyway...

20:31.800 --> 20:34.326
...I have an appointment.

20:34.569 --> 20:36.003
I have to leave.

20:36.805 --> 20:38.034
Oh.

20:45.680 --> 20:47.774
Perhaps...

20:48.049 --> 20:50.609
...I will cancel my appointment.

22:04.025 --> 22:07.723
- I do believe we're ready.
- I do believe you're right.

22:33.288 --> 22:35.348
Let's ease up a little.

22:37.692 --> 22:41.424
It wouldn't do to have old Cal
think we was too anxious.

22:42.130 --> 22:43.598
Yeah.

22:45.834 --> 22:47.166
Who's that?

22:47.402 --> 22:48.927
Monte Walsh.

22:49.371 --> 22:51.431
Chet Rollins.

22:52.807 --> 22:56.244
Nobody sits a horse like Monte Walsh.

22:57.545 --> 23:00.709
You used to sit one pretty good yourself.

23:01.015 --> 23:04.816
- I used to do a lot of things pretty good.
- You still do.

23:05.053 --> 23:07.113
You should know, Sairy.

23:07.355 --> 23:08.721
I do.

23:11.426 --> 23:13.190
- Howdy, Mr. Brennan.
- Mrs. Brennan.

23:13.428 --> 23:15.522
- Morning, boys.
- Fellas...

23:15.764 --> 23:18.757
...I heard about what happened
to the Cross Bar.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.559
Yes, ma'am. Rough winter.

23:21.236 --> 23:24.729
For us all, Monte. For us all.

23:26.007 --> 23:29.444
Chet and Monte, I want to introduce
you two boys to the future.

23:30.211 --> 23:33.113
Twentieth century in person,
Robert Slocumb.

23:33.348 --> 23:36.807
- This is Chet Rollins and Monte Walsh.
- Pleased, I'm sure.

23:37.252 --> 23:38.880
Same.

23:39.120 --> 23:42.113
- Robert.
- Robert's from Consolidated Cattle.

23:42.357 --> 23:45.850
- He's here two weeks learning cowboying.
- Two weeks?

23:46.094 --> 23:48.427
What'll he do the second week?

23:49.063 --> 23:52.522
A couple of the boys
are out castrating calves.

23:52.767 --> 23:56.135
Chet, maybe you and Monte
would like to put Robert to work.

23:56.371 --> 24:00.467
Oh, no, no. That's fine.
I'm more interested in the business part.

24:00.775 --> 24:02.710
That is the business part.

24:03.244 --> 24:05.770
Well, I meant the numbers and such.

24:06.014 --> 24:07.915
Robert's a great one for the numbers.

24:08.149 --> 24:13.019
- How about turning a herd in a thunderstorm?
- Robert's a great one for the numbers.

24:13.254 --> 24:17.692
- I could tell that. Couldn't you, Chet?
- I could tell that.

24:30.572 --> 24:32.973
- Looky here.
- Hey, Sunfish.

24:33.208 --> 24:35.575
Haven't seen you boys in a while.

24:36.211 --> 24:39.045
Hi, Monte. Chet.

24:39.514 --> 24:40.812
How's the grub?

24:41.916 --> 24:44.750
Good. It's good.

24:48.122 --> 24:50.318
- Hey, Joe.
- Hey, Chet. Monte.

25:12.447 --> 25:15.144
- Hi.
- Who's got what?

25:16.050 --> 25:18.519
Those two don't belong to no one.

25:27.729 --> 25:29.561
You play that thing much?

25:30.131 --> 25:33.397
- Yeah, unless people object.
- I object.

25:33.635 --> 25:35.627
You don't like music?

25:37.305 --> 25:38.796
I do.

25:41.442 --> 25:42.501
How's the grub?

25:43.611 --> 25:46.103
Good. It's good.

25:48.850 --> 25:52.844
- Who's the foreman of this outfit now?
- Hat Henderson. You know him?

25:53.087 --> 25:54.521
Know of.

25:54.756 --> 25:56.156
He's all right.

25:56.424 --> 26:00.520
Name's Sug. Sugar Wyman.
I got throwed.

26:00.929 --> 26:02.591
Monte Walsh.

26:02.997 --> 26:04.590
Chet Rollins.

26:06.568 --> 26:08.366
I heard about you.

26:08.636 --> 26:09.831
Anything good?

26:10.104 --> 26:13.632
Heard you used to be the best
bronc rider south of Snake River.

26:14.208 --> 26:15.904
North of the Snake too.

26:16.311 --> 26:19.804
Mr. Brennan reckons he has the best
bronc stomper in the territory.

26:20.048 --> 26:21.414
What do you say?

26:21.649 --> 26:23.948
He better take good care of him.
Who is it?

26:24.185 --> 26:26.654
Why, Shorty Austin, of course.

26:28.790 --> 26:30.782
My, oh, my.

26:34.762 --> 26:36.993
Come and get it!

26:39.434 --> 26:40.993
- Howdy.
- Hey, boys.

26:41.536 --> 26:43.437
Hat Henderson. I'm foreman here.

26:43.705 --> 26:45.867
- Chet Rollins.
- Monte Walsh. How you doing?

26:46.174 --> 26:48.871
Better, since I gave up hope.
Dally Johnson.

26:49.143 --> 26:51.874
- Nice to meet you.
- Dally.

26:53.481 --> 26:55.609
Well, I'll be damned.

26:55.850 --> 26:57.910
You already are.

26:58.853 --> 27:01.880
- Monte. Chet.
- Hey, Shorty.

27:28.383 --> 27:32.252
- Ain't you hungry?
- Too tired to eat, I guess.

27:32.487 --> 27:35.150
Not eating makes you tired.

27:41.295 --> 27:43.161
- Smart dog.
- So, Monte...

27:43.398 --> 27:45.629
...Sugar down there tells me you...

27:45.867 --> 27:48.598
...don't agree with Brennan
about Shorty here.

27:50.638 --> 27:54.040
Well, that depends on your
definition of bronc stomping.

27:54.275 --> 27:57.643
God allow as I seen Shorty
kill a few in his day...

27:57.879 --> 28:02.908
...there are some people who see it kinder
to shoot a horse than to ride it to death.

28:10.024 --> 28:13.893
That smell ain't something you get
entirely used to, that's for sure.

28:14.128 --> 28:17.121
If you're starving, you'll eat.

28:17.398 --> 28:18.991
Can't somebody tell him?

28:19.233 --> 28:21.759
Tell the cook?
You know better than that.

28:26.808 --> 28:30.006
- Where was you last?
- Cross Bar.

28:30.244 --> 28:31.507
How's the cook?

28:31.746 --> 28:33.442
Nothing like you.

28:33.681 --> 28:36.150
- Amen.
- Ain't that the truth?

28:56.871 --> 28:59.363
- What are you doing?!
- I got his leg!

29:01.042 --> 29:02.908
Come over here!

29:16.324 --> 29:17.952
My leg!

29:51.726 --> 29:53.194
Giddap.

30:01.669 --> 30:04.434
Easy. Easy. Steady, now.

30:17.685 --> 30:19.483
Playful, ain't he?

30:20.288 --> 30:23.952
- Watch him, Shorty.
- I got him, I got him. That's it.

30:26.427 --> 30:29.420
I busted everything so far...

30:30.131 --> 30:33.624
...except this bay horse. You can
have him for a pet when I'm done.

30:33.935 --> 30:35.801
Think I'll live that long?

30:36.037 --> 30:37.528
Watch...

30:38.840 --> 30:40.468
...and learn.

30:45.880 --> 30:47.041
Turn him loose!

30:50.251 --> 30:51.310
Stay on him, Shorty!

30:56.390 --> 30:57.881
Stay with him!

31:03.798 --> 31:06.165
He don't even want the saddle.

31:07.635 --> 31:09.228
He's something, huh?

31:09.470 --> 31:13.407
It's still a horse, ain't it?
Think maybe he's too much for you?

31:13.641 --> 31:16.668
Well, I'm the only one
gonna find that out.

31:19.313 --> 31:20.713
Giddap.

31:24.685 --> 31:25.880
Hey, Monte.

31:26.654 --> 31:29.556
If that old wagon's
too tough for you to ride...

31:29.824 --> 31:32.760
...I can get old man Brennan's
rocking chair for you!

31:40.334 --> 31:42.803
- Something on your mind?
- Yep.

31:43.571 --> 31:45.233
Wanna tell me?

31:45.506 --> 31:50.001
Till just now, I didn't think there was
a horse foaled that I couldn't ride.

31:50.244 --> 31:52.236
Now what do you think?

31:52.480 --> 31:54.881
He's Shorty's worry, not mine.

32:14.936 --> 32:15.869
Howdy.

32:16.170 --> 32:17.968
Good morning.

32:18.773 --> 32:21.641
- Where you want it?
- You can drop it right there.

32:25.212 --> 32:28.580
Don't you boys be feeling sorry
for me fixing fence.

32:30.851 --> 32:33.286
Boys say you rode with
General Hooker in the war.

32:33.988 --> 32:36.958
That's right. Took his name too.

32:37.224 --> 32:40.251
Fighting Joe Hooker, that's me.

32:40.494 --> 32:43.157
I was charging alongside of him in '63...

32:43.397 --> 32:46.561
...when he led the army of the
Cumberland at Missionary Ridge.

32:46.801 --> 32:50.329
We was all young on Missionary Ridge.

32:51.572 --> 32:54.007
Thought we'd always be that way...

32:54.241 --> 32:55.641
...or die young.

32:58.946 --> 33:01.415
I've had a good life.

33:03.284 --> 33:05.446
General Hooker's pipe.

33:06.187 --> 33:08.622
His missis gave it to me.

33:14.729 --> 33:17.198
Anything else we can do for you, Joe?

33:19.400 --> 33:24.031
You can bring me two women
and a fine bottle of whiskey.

33:27.608 --> 33:29.236
So long, Joe.

33:39.854 --> 33:42.255
Talks like his life is over with.

33:42.490 --> 33:45.722
Might as well be, riding fence.

33:56.170 --> 33:57.229
Mr. Brennan.

33:57.505 --> 33:59.667
Have a good time, boys.

34:11.485 --> 34:14.353
I should charge you for haircuts.

34:14.588 --> 34:16.681
I should charge you for something.

34:16.924 --> 34:18.916
How much you've cost me
all these years.

34:19.159 --> 34:22.619
Don't complain,
or I'll start charging you.

34:22.929 --> 34:25.195
You don't think
I'm worth paying?

34:25.966 --> 34:27.297
Oh, yes.

34:28.069 --> 34:29.799
You're worth it.

34:33.641 --> 34:37.510
Are all you foreign ladies
so interested in a man's hair?

34:40.246 --> 34:41.681
I don't know.

34:50.324 --> 34:51.348
Finished.

34:51.625 --> 34:53.594
How do I look?

35:01.535 --> 35:03.731
The light is better over here.

36:45.072 --> 36:47.200
It's mine, Sunfish! It's mine!

36:48.008 --> 36:49.772
Goddang it! Hey!

37:17.171 --> 37:19.470
Them's Brennan's mustangs.

37:20.507 --> 37:21.998
They belong to them accountants.

37:22.243 --> 37:23.973
Makes no difference
who owns them...

37:24.211 --> 37:26.646
...'cause we never done it
for the owner anyway.

37:26.880 --> 37:29.907
- Monte, you cowboy for the money?
- Not likely.

37:30.184 --> 37:34.918
- Me, I like the hours.
- Me too. I love sleeping late.

37:35.155 --> 37:38.319
These horses are going to the railhead.
Then they're army property.

37:38.559 --> 37:40.050
Let's get at it.

38:22.670 --> 38:23.603
Move!

38:36.917 --> 38:38.943
I'll turn them, Monte!

38:47.561 --> 38:48.551
Giddap!

38:57.671 --> 38:59.469
What kept you, Shorty?

39:35.042 --> 39:36.442
There they are.

39:39.279 --> 39:40.770
There they are.

40:09.410 --> 40:11.879
Let's have a little fun.

40:34.168 --> 40:35.192
That's it!

40:35.469 --> 40:36.630
Sons of bitches.

40:36.904 --> 40:39.271
- That's it.
- Hold on. Let's not get too hasty.

40:39.506 --> 40:42.442
Hasty? I'm fixing to rip
someone's arms off.

40:42.676 --> 40:45.908
I'm gonna rip somebody's head off!
Come on, Joe!

40:46.146 --> 40:47.808
What the hell.

40:48.649 --> 40:52.313
This is gonna be one hell of a mess.
Let's get out of here.

40:56.490 --> 40:58.789
We'll come back
and pick up these nags later.

41:25.719 --> 41:27.278
Let's pull, boys!

41:28.088 --> 41:30.148
Keep it tight, boys! Pull!

41:30.958 --> 41:32.688
Son of a bitch!

41:32.926 --> 41:35.657
- Tear it off of there!
- Come on, guys, come on!

42:23.277 --> 42:24.677
Come on!

42:24.945 --> 42:27.005
Damn sons of bitches!

42:53.774 --> 42:56.676
Sons of bitches!
You stinking coward!

43:57.037 --> 43:59.233
No call for gunplay.

44:00.474 --> 44:02.067
No call for this thing, neither.

44:04.211 --> 44:06.510
No. No call.

44:07.648 --> 44:09.674
This was a nice, simple fistfight,
Newley.

44:09.950 --> 44:12.920
No reason to be hitting
someone with a wrench.

44:13.153 --> 44:15.122
Yeah, well, I thought it was a holdup.

44:15.389 --> 44:17.790
They would've had their
guns out, stupid.

44:18.692 --> 44:21.958
And what in holy hell am I gonna do
about this train now?

44:22.195 --> 44:24.221
Can't get any decent draft
with no stack.

44:24.531 --> 44:27.899
- I can't budge the damn thing!
- What's your name?

44:28.869 --> 44:29.859
Rudy.

44:31.872 --> 44:35.968
Rudy, you can't have
no idea how little I care.

44:36.943 --> 44:38.309
Come on, let's go.

44:38.545 --> 44:40.411
Forget these bastards.

44:41.448 --> 44:43.076
Joe, how's your head?

44:43.316 --> 44:46.514
I sure know I got one,
but that won't bother my riding.

44:46.753 --> 44:49.518
- How's that leg?
- My ankle doesn't feel too good...

44:49.756 --> 44:51.691
...but it won't be nothing on a horse.

44:51.925 --> 44:55.259
Sugar! Dally!
Get them horses over here.

44:55.529 --> 44:58.089
We got 43 foal critters to find!

45:07.774 --> 45:10.710
I see that they had provocation.
I even sympathize.

45:11.011 --> 45:13.173
But the company would never
approve payment.

45:13.413 --> 45:16.850
Those men are personally responsible.
They're gonna have to pay.

45:18.685 --> 45:21.519
The company will require them to pay.

45:21.755 --> 45:24.850
The company doesn't know
anything about horses.

45:25.092 --> 45:26.788
It doesn't know
anything about men.

45:27.094 --> 45:29.393
Are you saying the rail road
shouldn't get paid?

45:29.663 --> 45:32.223
No, sir, that's not what I'm saying.

45:32.532 --> 45:35.229
Our boys stomped on
that rail road crew pretty good.

45:35.469 --> 45:38.405
Tore up their rig. Railroad's got a right.

45:38.638 --> 45:40.197
Then?

45:40.507 --> 45:45.502
Our boys make $25 a month,
buy their own gear.

45:45.812 --> 45:48.509
They are not going to pay.

45:59.526 --> 46:01.552
I'm ordering you to make them pay.

46:05.832 --> 46:08.233
I can fire you, you know.

46:15.075 --> 46:17.635
You'd lose your job for them?

46:19.646 --> 46:24.107
I'd lose my life for them,
and they would for me.

46:27.788 --> 46:29.780
Who are you people?

46:38.398 --> 46:42.529
Maybe the company will pick up part of it.
That's the best I can do.

46:45.105 --> 46:49.372
See, these boys have no home
except for a horse and a cook shack.

46:49.609 --> 46:52.977
They got no property
but a saddle and a gun.

46:53.480 --> 46:56.882
They don't earn any money.
Got no wife, got no kids.

46:57.150 --> 47:01.611
They spend their entire life pushing cattle
around to where they don't want to go.

47:01.855 --> 47:04.120
Sounds like a terrible job.

47:04.391 --> 47:08.487
Yes, sir, it is a terrible job,
but it's their job.

47:08.728 --> 47:11.220
All they got is freedom and pride...

47:11.464 --> 47:15.026
...keeping their word
and looking out for one another.

47:15.268 --> 47:17.999
All they got is their rules.

47:19.039 --> 47:21.873
And where are these rules written down?

47:22.108 --> 47:24.805
They're not written down,
you damn fool.

47:25.045 --> 47:27.014
They're lived.

47:27.280 --> 47:29.306
But they work for us.

47:30.250 --> 47:33.846
They don't work for anybody.
They work for the life.

47:34.120 --> 47:35.884
How do you know
all of this?

47:39.392 --> 47:41.384
'Cause that's how you are.

47:43.263 --> 47:46.427
Which is why the company
has to pay the rail road.

47:47.434 --> 47:49.926
And if we don't, you'll quit?

47:50.637 --> 47:52.970
Every last one of us.

47:55.041 --> 47:58.808
Well, Mr. Brennan,
there aren't any other jobs.

48:01.915 --> 48:06.649
And before I go,
I will kick your ass.

48:08.488 --> 48:10.081
The company will pay.

48:29.876 --> 48:31.845
You ain't eating, countess.

48:33.280 --> 48:34.680
No, I'm not.

48:34.915 --> 48:37.407
Is something bothering you?

48:39.286 --> 48:42.051
- Yes.
- You wanna tell me about it?

48:44.124 --> 48:45.183
No.

48:46.326 --> 48:49.296
- You gonna eat them potatoes?
- You can take them.

48:49.529 --> 48:51.361
- You sure?
- Yes.

48:52.332 --> 48:54.164
I like to see you eat.

49:03.510 --> 49:06.241
How come you ain't sleeping?

49:09.549 --> 49:11.643
This is our last night.

49:13.153 --> 49:15.918
I'm moving to Antelope Junction.

49:17.791 --> 49:19.919
That ain't no place.

49:20.560 --> 49:21.528
I know...

49:21.795 --> 49:26.733
...but I operate in a profession
of diminishing returns.

49:27.634 --> 49:29.535
What's that mean?

49:31.771 --> 49:35.367
It means that things change.
There's no one left here...

49:35.608 --> 49:37.770
...except town people and a few farmers.

49:38.011 --> 49:39.707
Well, you can do better than that.

49:39.946 --> 49:43.405
Antelope Junction has a rail road spur.

49:47.754 --> 49:49.746
There's nothing else I can do.

49:52.292 --> 49:55.353
- Things don't have to change.
- Monte...

49:55.595 --> 49:59.965
...as time goes by, we all have to
take the best we can get.

50:00.200 --> 50:05.138
Perhaps, one day, you'll find
that the same applies to you.

50:08.608 --> 50:10.440
I ain't changing.

50:11.611 --> 50:14.775
Oh, God, I hope not.

50:26.993 --> 50:30.555
Antelope Junction's 20 miles away.

50:47.614 --> 50:50.140
- It's better part of a month's pay.
- No.

50:50.383 --> 50:53.683
- To help settle in.
- No, I've never taken any money from you.

50:53.920 --> 50:56.913
It ain't money, it's capital.

50:57.891 --> 51:01.191
That's what they call it these days.
Go on.

51:25.885 --> 51:27.683
Come on, now.

51:29.789 --> 51:32.122
It ain't like I don't have a horse.

51:35.495 --> 51:36.428
Hey.

52:44.998 --> 52:46.728
- How is it with the herd?
- Good.

52:47.000 --> 52:48.525
It's good.

53:02.015 --> 53:05.144
You serve up some of your revenge
for breakfast, Skimpy?

53:05.385 --> 53:09.152
Don't have to be for breakfast.
Could be anytime.

53:20.333 --> 53:22.632
Ain't much of a herd so far.

53:29.042 --> 53:31.978
- Well, if it ain't Rufus Brady.
- Powder.

53:33.213 --> 53:35.205
Can you all feed
another couple of mouths?

53:35.448 --> 53:37.314
Sure we can, Rufus.

53:37.550 --> 53:39.143
Monte.

53:40.353 --> 53:41.946
Powder.

53:48.561 --> 53:51.326
I don't suppose there's
any work around here.

53:54.033 --> 53:56.127
I didn't think so.

53:58.238 --> 53:59.968
How'd it go in Charleyville?

54:00.206 --> 54:03.233
I tried working on the rail road,
but it ain't for me.

54:03.509 --> 54:05.375
I like horses.

54:05.612 --> 54:08.013
Ain't like it used to be, hey, Rufus?

54:09.749 --> 54:12.412
Ain't never gonna be
like it used to be.

54:12.652 --> 54:15.247
Don't have to be.
Gonna be better.

54:32.372 --> 54:35.638
- Ain't that Fighting Joe?
- That fool.

54:37.410 --> 54:40.312
He ain't gonna be worth
a bent nickel he don't slow down.

54:40.546 --> 54:42.105
What's he doing?

54:45.151 --> 54:47.211
Coming down Missionary Ridge.

54:50.423 --> 54:52.449
He'll never make it.

54:52.692 --> 54:54.058
He don't want to.

55:24.791 --> 55:26.760
Must have all caught up with him.

55:27.794 --> 55:30.696
Do you suppose he felt anything?

55:32.532 --> 55:35.525
Mostly, he felt it before he jumped.

55:51.250 --> 55:53.446
Sure is nice of Brennan
to send these over.

55:54.354 --> 55:57.051
Hard to bury somebody without it.

55:58.925 --> 56:03.420
Told me he was charging Consolidated
for six quarts of wolf poison.

56:04.197 --> 56:06.564
Consolidated's getting off cheap.

56:08.835 --> 56:11.395
- What was his name?
- Whose name, Dally?

56:13.206 --> 56:14.606
Fighting Joe Hooker.

56:17.510 --> 56:21.242
I'm gonna carve a marker for his grave.
I ought to use his real name.

56:21.614 --> 56:22.843
Yes, sir.

56:23.750 --> 56:26.117
This here bag's got his belongings.

56:39.832 --> 56:41.095
Albert Miller.

56:45.004 --> 56:47.599
What's your first name, Shorty?

56:51.711 --> 56:53.179
Frank.

56:53.913 --> 56:57.247
What's yours, Dally? In case you
go first, I'll make your marker.

56:58.751 --> 57:00.151
It's Wallace.

57:02.488 --> 57:05.458
My name's Henry.
Got a middle name too.

57:05.725 --> 57:07.921
I want them both on my marker.

57:08.694 --> 57:10.720
Henry Lewis Wyman.

57:12.031 --> 57:14.364
What's your real name, Skimpy?

57:15.368 --> 57:16.529
Skimpy!

57:18.805 --> 57:21.604
Why y'all fussing so
about your real names?

57:21.841 --> 57:24.367
Nobody got family
to visit their graves.

57:30.450 --> 57:31.679
Hey, Monte.

57:32.485 --> 57:34.613
What's your real name?

57:37.089 --> 57:38.887
Don't Monte sound real?

57:39.125 --> 57:41.924
Ain't never sound real to me.

57:44.263 --> 57:45.697
What is it?

58:00.213 --> 58:01.841
Montelius.

58:10.223 --> 58:13.284
What the hell was that for?

58:14.293 --> 58:16.353
To prevent smiling.

58:16.596 --> 58:19.225
Well, you just better
make your own marker.

58:19.465 --> 58:22.902
Nobody could spell your name, anyway.

58:29.442 --> 58:33.174
I figured on a small herd,
but not as small as we have.

58:33.412 --> 58:37.406
Consolidated won't spend
any money on cows.

58:39.352 --> 58:41.218
I gotta let four of you go.

58:42.889 --> 58:45.791
Joe Hooker's dead,
so that leaves three.

58:46.826 --> 58:48.192
Sugar.

58:49.161 --> 58:50.493
Shorty.

58:51.163 --> 58:53.132
Joe Joslin.

58:54.767 --> 58:56.599
The three youngest.

58:58.871 --> 59:01.397
That's as fair as I could figure it.

59:04.710 --> 59:07.578
One of you can stay on
if you want to ride fence.

59:09.448 --> 59:11.076
Good luck to you, boys.

59:22.795 --> 59:24.593
What are you gonna do, Shorty?

59:27.033 --> 59:28.592
I don't know.

59:35.841 --> 59:37.833
One thing's for sure.

59:38.110 --> 59:40.238
I ain't gonna ride fence.

01:00:09.642 --> 01:00:11.634
- Good luck, Shorty.
- See you.

01:00:13.846 --> 01:00:16.213
- Monte and me have a couple extra--
- Better keep it...

01:00:16.449 --> 01:00:19.476
- ...the way things been going.
- Go on. Take it, Shorty.

01:00:19.752 --> 01:00:23.780
It ain't gonna make no difference to us.
We're getting our three squares.

01:00:25.491 --> 01:00:26.686
Thanks.

01:00:26.926 --> 01:00:28.258
Besides...

01:00:28.494 --> 01:00:31.157
...I can always get it back
from you in a poker game.

01:00:41.107 --> 01:00:43.633
Wish I knew something
besides cowboying.

01:00:44.910 --> 01:00:46.435
Shorty.

01:01:00.393 --> 01:01:02.589
Well, I ain't gonna ride you now.

01:01:03.763 --> 01:01:05.823
Bay's all yours now, Monte.

01:01:06.532 --> 01:01:08.023
So long.

01:01:36.896 --> 01:01:38.762
Why did Brennan have to let them go?

01:01:40.566 --> 01:01:41.534
What?

01:01:41.767 --> 01:01:43.759
Why did Brennan have to let them go?

01:01:44.036 --> 01:01:45.800
Brennan had no choice.

01:01:46.072 --> 01:01:49.804
Consolidated sends word,
that's the way it's gotta be.

01:01:50.176 --> 01:01:51.974
I never thought about it like that.

01:01:52.211 --> 01:01:55.079
Well, you think wrong
too damn much, Dally.

01:01:57.049 --> 01:01:59.450
Well, yes. By God, I do.

01:02:10.596 --> 01:02:12.929
Come on, Montelius! Come on!

01:02:13.165 --> 01:02:14.963
All right. Now, that's enough.

01:02:15.234 --> 01:02:18.136
Break it up! I said, break it up!

01:02:23.743 --> 01:02:26.770
Damn it, Hat, that was a good hand.

01:02:28.247 --> 01:02:30.648
- Just calm down, Sunfish.
- All right.

01:02:32.852 --> 01:02:34.548
His was too.

01:02:46.031 --> 01:02:47.966
My, oh, my.

01:02:54.673 --> 01:02:56.642
Stop hitting me.

01:02:57.042 --> 01:03:00.843
My leg. Get off my leg.

01:03:03.315 --> 01:03:04.681
Stop it.

01:03:04.950 --> 01:03:08.512
- What's going on, boys?
- Get off my leg. You're crushing me.

01:03:12.158 --> 01:03:14.184
What's this all about?

01:03:19.532 --> 01:03:21.364
I plumb forgot.

01:03:37.349 --> 01:03:39.045
Well, what do you know?

01:03:39.985 --> 01:03:42.318
I ain't felt so good in months.

01:03:43.589 --> 01:03:45.785
You know, maybe I was wrong.

01:03:46.492 --> 01:03:52.022
No, you weren't wrong, Dally. It's just
ain't nothing been right these days.

01:04:37.309 --> 01:04:40.438
- Monte.
- Yeah?

01:04:41.647 --> 01:04:43.616
Mary and I are gonna get married.

01:04:49.922 --> 01:04:51.857
How's that gonna work?

01:04:52.391 --> 01:04:55.953
- What do you mean?
- You being a cowboy.

01:04:57.830 --> 01:05:00.095
I ain't gonna be much longer.

01:05:01.867 --> 01:05:03.563
What you gonna be?

01:05:04.436 --> 01:05:06.371
A hardware man.

01:05:08.707 --> 01:05:11.233
- In a store?
- In a store.

01:05:16.916 --> 01:05:19.647
- So you're gonna live in town?
- Look, Monte...

01:05:19.885 --> 01:05:24.687
...you have any idea how many
cowhands there were 10, 15 years ago?

01:05:24.957 --> 01:05:29.588
There's a hell of a lot fewer now.
Pretty soon there won't be hardly any.

01:05:29.828 --> 01:05:35.165
- Come on. It ain't that bad.
- Yes, it is, Monte.

01:05:35.434 --> 01:05:39.667
You can ride down to Texas and up into
Canada and back, and that's fine.

01:05:39.905 --> 01:05:42.932
But there ain't no one that's
gonna pay you for doing it.

01:05:43.175 --> 01:05:47.875
Anyway, I figure if folks like us
and Cal Brennan and even Shorty...

01:05:48.113 --> 01:05:50.514
...are gonna be pushed around
by accountants...

01:05:51.850 --> 01:05:55.685
...then some of us might as well get
in on it and do a little pushing.

01:05:58.157 --> 01:06:01.127
Well, it ain't my idea of how to live.

01:06:07.633 --> 01:06:10.330
Nobody gets to be a cowboy
forever, Monte.

01:07:12.231 --> 01:07:14.496
Turn around slow, Brady.

01:07:19.271 --> 01:07:23.208
- There's a gun on you, Rufus.
- You stay out of this, sonny.

01:07:52.004 --> 01:07:54.235
Maybe we should get a doctor.

01:07:56.275 --> 01:07:58.039
Ain't no need.

01:08:04.783 --> 01:08:06.615
Let's get out of here!

01:08:29.374 --> 01:08:33.812
Brady and Powder is wanted for
robbing a bank in Charleyville.

01:08:34.712 --> 01:08:37.615
- I don't know what to do.
- Rufus robbing a bank?

01:08:37.850 --> 01:08:41.309
- It's more Powder's style.
- $500 reward out for him.

01:08:41.553 --> 01:08:44.113
- He must be getting mean.
- I never been in a bank.

01:08:44.389 --> 01:08:46.483
Soon as word's out,
they'll send for help.

01:08:46.758 --> 01:08:48.783
If he'd told me he was a marshal,
then--

01:08:49.027 --> 01:08:51.553
When this settles down
you can tell it your way.

01:08:51.830 --> 01:08:53.765
Climb aboard.
You don't have much time.

01:08:54.032 --> 01:08:58.527
If I was you, I'd ride south. If you
make a fortune there, send us some.

01:08:58.804 --> 01:09:03.868
- Things look pretty good around Laramie.
- If there ain't no work, try the banks.

01:09:05.444 --> 01:09:08.073
I ain't never killed a man before.

01:09:08.313 --> 01:09:09.508
Get going.

01:09:16.388 --> 01:09:19.586
I'm gonna miss that short-fused
son of a bitch.

01:10:02.467 --> 01:10:05.027
- Nice store.
- Sure is.

01:10:05.637 --> 01:10:08.266
- Nice wedding.
- Sure is.

01:10:10.209 --> 01:10:13.441
- You boys ever been to a wedding?
- Nope.

01:10:13.712 --> 01:10:16.409
Then how the hell do you know
if it's a nice one?

01:10:16.648 --> 01:10:19.117
- Seems nice.
- It do.

01:10:24.890 --> 01:10:27.257
Ain't you gonna eat, boys?

01:10:27.492 --> 01:10:29.120
Sure we are.

01:10:30.028 --> 01:10:32.520
Would you like to dance with me,
Monte?

01:10:33.865 --> 01:10:36.733
- Well, thank you, ma'am.
- Mary.

01:10:37.035 --> 01:10:40.164
Mary, I don't know how to dance.

01:10:40.405 --> 01:10:44.069
Hell, Monte, neither do I.
Mary'll show you.

01:10:47.913 --> 01:10:50.508
I would like to kiss the bride.

01:11:00.525 --> 01:11:02.517
I know how to dance, Mary.

01:11:03.328 --> 01:11:06.162
I'd be delighted to dance
with you, Hat.

01:11:12.437 --> 01:11:14.201
Sorry we're late.

01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:17.337
- Mrs. Brennan, Mr. Brennan.
- Congratulations, Chet.

01:11:17.576 --> 01:11:18.771
- Thank you.
- Monte.

01:11:19.011 --> 01:11:20.206
Heard you sold the bay.

01:11:20.479 --> 01:11:23.506
Yes, sir, to a Wild West show.
Didn't earn his keep.

01:11:23.749 --> 01:11:26.412
- Chet, how about a drink?
- How about a few?

01:11:26.652 --> 01:11:28.712
Looks like a two-quart wedding to me.

01:11:28.954 --> 01:11:32.891
I've seen you at two-quart weddings.
You better dance while you still can.

01:11:33.158 --> 01:11:38.790
- I been dancing with you for 40 years.
- Sooner or later I'll teach you to lead.

01:11:51.910 --> 01:11:54.607
This mean I gotta buy my own tobacco?

01:11:56.148 --> 01:11:58.242
You'll be alone
in that shack this winter.

01:11:58.517 --> 01:12:01.248
The hell I will. I'll have a horse
and a mule with me.

01:12:01.486 --> 01:12:02.886
So you won't even miss me.

01:12:03.155 --> 01:12:07.286
Well, as long as I got that mule with
me, I won't even know you're gone.

01:12:09.428 --> 01:12:11.021
Lot of miles, Monte.

01:12:12.998 --> 01:12:15.229
And some pretty good ones too.

01:12:19.438 --> 01:12:20.770
Yeah.

01:15:06.171 --> 01:15:08.402
This ain't no place.

01:15:09.241 --> 01:15:11.005
No place at all.

01:15:17.015 --> 01:15:20.076
- Since when?
- Since I got here.

01:15:29.227 --> 01:15:32.288
- You all right?
- Sure.

01:15:36.268 --> 01:15:38.737
Was your mother and father married?

01:15:39.404 --> 01:15:44.900
- Probably. I don't really know.
- How come we never got married?

01:15:46.077 --> 01:15:48.273
You never asked me.

01:15:50.515 --> 01:15:55.317
Well, I never thought of it.
Cowboys don't get married...

01:15:55.787 --> 01:15:58.347
...unless they stop being cowboys.

01:16:00.025 --> 01:16:02.085
Chet's gotten married.

01:16:04.829 --> 01:16:08.163
Did you ride 20 miles to tell me that?

01:16:15.774 --> 01:16:20.439
I came here thinking I should get
myself a job and get us married.

01:16:20.745 --> 01:16:22.407
What do you think?

01:16:27.085 --> 01:16:28.485
I like it.

01:16:30.155 --> 01:16:35.321
Marriage is a common ambition
in my profession.

01:16:36.595 --> 01:16:41.499
- You want to think on it?
- No. The idea always appealed to me.

01:16:42.233 --> 01:16:44.600
Well, yeah, I guess it might at that.

01:16:49.107 --> 01:16:54.205
The way things are going, a cowboy
don't make enough to live right.

01:16:58.850 --> 01:17:01.547
I don't know what else I could do.

01:17:07.392 --> 01:17:12.524
- I don't belong in no hardware store.
- I know you don't.

01:17:17.435 --> 01:17:20.030
I don't know much about love, Martine.

01:17:22.841 --> 01:17:27.609
That's all right.
I know enough for both of us.

01:18:14.292 --> 01:18:16.193
My, oh, my.

01:18:25.403 --> 01:18:29.272
So you gonna be ornery
for a Wild West show now, huh?

01:18:34.512 --> 01:18:36.640
You know what I'm gonna do for you?

01:18:36.915 --> 01:18:40.147
I'm gonna teach you some
manners before you leave.

01:18:52.130 --> 01:18:53.359
Easy.

01:19:05.343 --> 01:19:06.572
Whoa.

01:19:09.147 --> 01:19:15.212
This ain't Shorty you're talking to here.
This is a master bronc stomper.

01:19:21.326 --> 01:19:22.487
Easy.

01:19:40.111 --> 01:19:44.845
When we get through,
you're gonna want to take a nap...

01:19:45.116 --> 01:19:49.816
...sit on the porch and wait
for the mares to come calling.

01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:31.322
You'll have to do better than that.

01:21:48.306 --> 01:21:51.367
Now, let's go back real peaceful-like.

01:22:00.718 --> 01:22:05.656
Well, well. I have seen riding
in my day, young man...

01:22:06.124 --> 01:22:09.094
...and I take my hat off to you.

01:22:09.394 --> 01:22:14.094
Now, I hope you don't mind my speaking
to you, but you are riding my horse.

01:22:14.332 --> 01:22:16.324
- Excuse me, cowboy.
- Don't worry.

01:22:16.601 --> 01:22:19.435
I'll pay for all of the damages.

01:22:22.373 --> 01:22:25.901
- Colonel Wilson's my name.
- Monte Walsh.

01:22:27.345 --> 01:22:32.249
Well, why don't you come on inside,
Mr. Walsh, and have a snort?

01:22:32.951 --> 01:22:34.214
Thanks.

01:22:40.725 --> 01:22:44.457
Hell of a ride, son. Hell of a ride.

01:22:45.596 --> 01:22:49.829
I've been looking for someone to take
over for my bronco rider.

01:22:50.068 --> 01:22:53.561
He's getting a little moss-grown.

01:22:54.605 --> 01:23:00.306
Now, I pay 30 a week,
plus all expenses.

01:23:00.545 --> 01:23:05.108
You'll have enough put away to get a
place of your own in a couple years.

01:23:08.353 --> 01:23:13.690
How'd you like to be
Texas Jack Butler?

01:23:13.925 --> 01:23:16.554
Star cowboy, bronc buster...

01:23:16.794 --> 01:23:20.424
...and all around wild man of the West.

01:23:22.767 --> 01:23:25.566
Just plain Monte Walsh'll do fine.

01:23:25.837 --> 01:23:30.866
But, you see, it won't do. Texas
Jack Butler is a long-established name.

01:23:31.109 --> 01:23:37.413
It's a name with history and pedigree.
Now, who knows you, Monte?

01:23:37.849 --> 01:23:42.617
Maybe here in Antelope Junction they
do. But we're just passing through.

01:23:42.854 --> 01:23:45.255
Back East's where the people see us...

01:23:45.523 --> 01:23:50.962
...and back East, well, people want
Texas Jack Butler. Savvy?

01:23:52.430 --> 01:23:56.891
So who is this Texas Jack Butler?

01:23:57.135 --> 01:24:01.539
The first one was a real nice fellow,
born in Joplin, Missouri.

01:24:01.806 --> 01:24:06.005
Got runned over by a streetcar in
Chicago about 6 years ago.

01:24:06.511 --> 01:24:12.644
Couldn't ride a horse worth a damn,
but he put on a real good show.

01:24:13.584 --> 01:24:16.918
I been Monte Walsh for a long time.

01:24:29.367 --> 01:24:35.603
- So I'm Texas Jack Butler.
- Fine. Good. It's a deal.

01:24:35.873 --> 01:24:40.368
Now, that's what a new century cowboy
ought to look like, Monte.

01:24:40.912 --> 01:24:44.212
Times change, men change with them.

01:24:44.615 --> 01:24:47.642
Otherwise, you get left behind.

01:24:48.686 --> 01:24:53.522
No more small operators.
Everything amalgamates.

01:24:53.758 --> 01:24:59.561
Business is big, getting bigger.
Machines do all the work.

01:24:59.831 --> 01:25:05.168
Another 20 years, we'll all be sitting
on cushions and eating ice cream.

01:25:05.670 --> 01:25:07.070
What's ice cream?

01:25:07.305 --> 01:25:13.108
Monte, you ain't keeping up. It's all
about seeing things you never seen.

01:25:13.344 --> 01:25:17.645
And making new friends.
And sleeping with new women.

01:25:17.882 --> 01:25:23.685
And living high up on the hog. And
all for a couple hours work a night.

01:25:23.921 --> 01:25:26.322
It's the 20th century.

01:25:42.974 --> 01:25:46.069
I ain't spitting on my whole life.

01:25:55.052 --> 01:25:57.851
So this fellow...

01:26:00.324 --> 01:26:03.351
...offers me a job in one of them
Wild West shows.

01:26:03.594 --> 01:26:07.827
And it would mean that I could quit
cowboying and get married.

01:26:11.335 --> 01:26:14.464
I don't want to stop cowboying,
Martine.

01:26:15.072 --> 01:26:16.665
You told him no.

01:26:17.408 --> 01:26:19.206
Yes, I did.

01:26:23.447 --> 01:26:27.646
You can't be something different than
you are, or you won't be.

01:26:27.985 --> 01:26:29.886
It comes to the same thing.

01:26:30.555 --> 01:26:35.493
- I'm sorry, Martine.
- I'm glad you didn't take it.

01:26:36.394 --> 01:26:37.657
You are?

01:26:40.131 --> 01:26:46.128
They trap cougars, put them in a cage
and drag them around the country...

01:26:46.404 --> 01:26:50.341
...to show them to people with vests
and straw hats.

01:26:50.575 --> 01:26:55.604
And the people think they're seeing a
wild cougar, but they're not.

01:26:56.547 --> 01:26:59.244
That's not a wild cougar anymore.

01:27:00.384 --> 01:27:03.013
You know, I was just thinking...

01:27:03.254 --> 01:27:07.282
...if I go back to the Slash Y, I
could maybe start saving my money.

01:27:07.525 --> 01:27:13.157
Maybe even ask Cal Brennan for a raise.
I don't want to lose you, Martine.

01:27:21.772 --> 01:27:23.934
I'll be right here, Monte.

01:27:47.231 --> 01:27:49.564
I'm telling you, Monte,
maybe they was rustled.

01:27:49.834 --> 01:27:52.565
And maybe they just moved
away from the herd.

01:27:52.837 --> 01:27:55.272
Sure don't look that way to me, Monte.

01:27:55.706 --> 01:27:57.402
Over here!

01:28:12.890 --> 01:28:14.882
Them's ours, all right.

01:28:37.415 --> 01:28:38.678
Afternoon.

01:28:39.684 --> 01:28:42.711
- Where'd you get them black cows?
- Bought them.

01:28:43.154 --> 01:28:45.385
- When?
- Week ago.

01:28:45.723 --> 01:28:48.192
- Who from?
- Three cowboys.

01:28:49.093 --> 01:28:50.686
Said their ranch was finished.

01:28:50.961 --> 01:28:54.363
- One of them riding a paint horse?
- That's right.

01:28:56.033 --> 01:28:59.470
- I got a bill of sale.
- It ain't worth nothing.

01:28:59.704 --> 01:29:01.764
Them cattle was rustled.

01:29:23.561 --> 01:29:26.690
I couldn't sleep if I rustled cattle.

01:29:31.635 --> 01:29:35.595
Where's Powder?
Out stealing or out selling?

01:29:35.873 --> 01:29:38.399
It ain't like we're rustling
from anybody we know.

01:29:38.676 --> 01:29:41.407
They all belong to a bunch
of fat-bellies back East.

01:29:41.645 --> 01:29:45.047
I thought robbing banks
was your style, Brady.

01:29:46.150 --> 01:29:47.618
We couldn't get work, Monte.

01:29:48.285 --> 01:29:52.723
A lot of good boys can't get work.
If I was starving I wouldn't rustle.

01:29:52.990 --> 01:29:56.586
Yeah? Well, you ain't. You're getting
your three squares a day.

01:29:56.827 --> 01:29:59.490
- Ain't no use talking to him.
- Brennan's a good man.

01:29:59.730 --> 01:30:01.756
- They ain't his!
- Makes no difference.

01:30:02.032 --> 01:30:04.627
- They belong to the Slash Y.
- The Slash Y?

01:30:04.869 --> 01:30:07.964
The life you're talking about's dead.
Snow buried it.

01:30:08.239 --> 01:30:13.473
It ain't dead! As long as there's one
cowboy taking care of one cow.

01:30:13.711 --> 01:30:16.647
- You go to hell, Monte.
- You shut your mouth.

01:30:28.125 --> 01:30:29.593
Get out of here, Shorty.

01:30:32.596 --> 01:30:34.428
And put that thing away!

01:30:58.989 --> 01:31:00.321
What happened here, Monte?

01:31:02.693 --> 01:31:04.321
Shorty got away.

01:31:32.523 --> 01:31:34.754
- It ain't gonna happen.
- He'll stake us.

01:31:34.992 --> 01:31:40.363
- More than likely, he's gonna turn us in.
- Hey, Monte didn't and neither will Chet.

01:31:43.968 --> 01:31:45.368
Shorty.

01:31:46.170 --> 01:31:47.399
What are you doing here?

01:31:47.671 --> 01:31:49.936
Well, things been pretty tough for us, Chet.

01:31:51.709 --> 01:31:54.440
Thought you might be able
to give us a little cash.

01:31:54.712 --> 01:31:58.012
So as you can run?
You gonna run your whole life now?

01:31:58.249 --> 01:32:00.445
A stake will get me
where nobody knows me.

01:32:00.684 --> 01:32:02.846
Ain't never happens that way.

01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:04.748
Give yourself up, Shorty.

01:32:04.989 --> 01:32:07.458
- Just what I figured.
- Stay out of this.

01:32:08.893 --> 01:32:12.227
Sugar'll tell how the marshal drawed
without showing his badge.

01:32:13.831 --> 01:32:15.129
We ain't getting nothing.

01:32:15.366 --> 01:32:17.961
- I told you to stay out of this!
- Unless we take it!

01:32:21.005 --> 01:32:24.669
- Hand over what you got.
- The hell I will.

01:32:29.747 --> 01:32:32.114
You want to widow your woman twice?

01:32:59.209 --> 01:33:00.108
Shorty--

01:33:08.919 --> 01:33:10.751
Oh, my God, no.

01:33:14.191 --> 01:33:15.489
No.

01:33:16.794 --> 01:33:17.887
No!

01:33:27.705 --> 01:33:30.004
Not going to Chet's funeral?

01:33:31.241 --> 01:33:33.005
To me, Chet ain't dead yet.

01:33:34.712 --> 01:33:37.648
- I got word from Consolidated--
- I ain't interested.

01:33:39.283 --> 01:33:40.615
Well...

01:33:40.851 --> 01:33:42.513
...you need to be interested.

01:33:42.753 --> 01:33:45.723
Consolidated's giving up on the Slash Y...

01:33:45.990 --> 01:33:47.686
...for the time being.

01:33:47.925 --> 01:33:50.918
Seems they're fixing to fence in
all their land...

01:33:51.195 --> 01:33:52.686
...and that's all.

01:33:55.933 --> 01:33:57.834
Gonna be a lot of fence.

01:34:01.271 --> 01:34:05.868
I'll be telling the boys after the funeral.
I figured I'd square with you now.

01:34:06.744 --> 01:34:07.768
Thanks.

01:34:10.147 --> 01:34:13.606
Will you tell Dally to put
"Chester Rollins" on his marker...

01:34:14.518 --> 01:34:18.421
...and that he was from Illinois.
Chet was proud of that.

01:34:19.023 --> 01:34:20.355
Yes, sir.

01:34:21.191 --> 01:34:23.683
And tell Mary why I'm not there.

01:35:34.031 --> 01:35:36.398
- Hey, Monte.
- Hello, Sugar.

01:35:37.468 --> 01:35:39.403
You'll never guess
who come by earlier.

01:35:39.670 --> 01:35:41.468
- Shorty.
- Yeah.

01:35:42.773 --> 01:35:43.934
I'm after him.

01:35:44.641 --> 01:35:47.167
Since when you been doing
the law's work, Monte?

01:35:47.411 --> 01:35:50.813
Since Shorty blew Chet in half
with a shotgun.

01:35:52.015 --> 01:35:53.244
God, no.

01:35:55.552 --> 01:35:56.451
Why?

01:35:57.755 --> 01:36:00.156
Chet couldn't say.

01:36:02.192 --> 01:36:04.684
What a short-fused bastard.

01:36:07.965 --> 01:36:09.957
How long you been working here, Sugar?

01:36:11.769 --> 01:36:14.967
- You like it?
- It's a job.

01:36:15.606 --> 01:36:19.407
I figure I'll stay through winter.
It's got a good stove.

01:36:20.110 --> 01:36:24.377
Last winter, Chet and me was in
a line shack for the Cross Bar.

01:36:24.615 --> 01:36:27.483
I was punching for the Double Six.

01:36:35.192 --> 01:36:36.751
Hey, Monte?

01:36:39.463 --> 01:36:41.523
I hate to be the one to tell.

01:36:42.232 --> 01:36:44.929
I heard Martine's in a real bad way.

01:37:18.068 --> 01:37:20.003
You're too late, mister.

01:37:21.438 --> 01:37:23.737
Just before sundown.

01:37:24.107 --> 01:37:26.770
She didn't want to hold on any longer.

01:37:27.010 --> 01:37:28.842
Pneumonia.

01:37:32.049 --> 01:37:33.847
You must be Walsh.

01:37:34.751 --> 01:37:37.152
She said you'd be around.

01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:44.724
This box is for you.

01:37:47.164 --> 01:37:51.158
It's funny. She held on to it
right to the last.

01:37:56.006 --> 01:37:57.804
I did everything I could.

01:37:58.075 --> 01:37:59.805
Believe me, I did.

01:38:00.077 --> 01:38:02.876
I want her to have a proper funeral.

01:38:05.082 --> 01:38:07.017
I got some cash.

01:38:07.451 --> 01:38:09.317
It's all fixed up.

01:38:10.454 --> 01:38:12.320
Funny thing, that.

01:38:12.589 --> 01:38:15.559
Seemed like she was real
particular about some things.

01:38:16.393 --> 01:38:19.830
Had enough set aside
to give herself a real nice one.

01:38:20.631 --> 01:38:22.759
Plain, but nice.

01:38:23.033 --> 01:38:25.025
Foreign girl, wasn't she?

01:38:26.637 --> 01:38:28.799
She was a countess.

01:38:29.473 --> 01:38:32.602
Girls like that sure do get
some strange notions.

01:38:32.843 --> 01:38:36.644
The whole time she was here
she held on to that old box.

01:40:45.275 --> 01:40:47.210
Ain't you ever coming out?

01:41:40.630 --> 01:41:42.326
I knew you'd be coming for me, Monte.

01:41:44.534 --> 01:41:46.935
No sense wearing out good horses chasing.

01:41:47.771 --> 01:41:51.173
I figured you'd be here when
Sugar told you about Martine.

01:41:52.909 --> 01:41:54.400
I'm sorry.

01:41:56.012 --> 01:41:58.641
You should've told Sugar about Chet.

01:41:58.915 --> 01:42:00.474
Sorry about that too?

01:42:02.352 --> 01:42:04.480
There's no use talking, I suppose.

01:42:06.523 --> 01:42:08.185
No use.

01:42:32.949 --> 01:42:34.315
Turn around.

01:42:35.485 --> 01:42:37.147
Turn around, damn it!

01:43:01.511 --> 01:43:02.570
Get on. Get on!

01:43:07.551 --> 01:43:08.951
Get on.

01:45:31.394 --> 01:45:33.761
I'm here, Shorty.

01:46:36.192 --> 01:46:38.684
I rode down the bay.

01:46:42.432 --> 01:46:44.799
You had to sit him high.

01:46:48.471 --> 01:46:51.566
Well, that's what it was.

01:46:55.879 --> 01:46:57.677
That figures.

01:48:20.330 --> 01:48:22.492
Well, I'll vow.

01:48:23.233 --> 01:48:24.565
That's Monte Walsh.

01:48:28.438 --> 01:48:31.374
Ain't nobody sits a horse
like Monte Walsh.

01:48:55.999 --> 01:48:57.592
This ought to be good.

01:49:05.074 --> 01:49:08.203
It's a shame everyone's
not gifted with proper manners.

01:49:09.812 --> 01:49:13.681
Say, I know you.
You're Walsh from the Slash Y.

01:49:13.950 --> 01:49:15.680
I'm Slocumb.

01:49:16.152 --> 01:49:17.484
The accountant.

01:49:17.720 --> 01:49:21.282
Range manager now.
That's all my land.

01:49:23.793 --> 01:49:24.954
Your land.

01:49:26.763 --> 01:49:29.392
Well, Consolidated's land.

01:49:31.367 --> 01:49:34.166
This fella's a cowboy, Annie.
The real thing.

01:49:34.437 --> 01:49:36.463
I've never seen a real cowboy before.

01:49:36.706 --> 01:49:38.140
Ma'am.

01:49:38.875 --> 01:49:42.403
Well, why don't you move your nag
out of the road so's I can get by.

01:49:42.645 --> 01:49:46.241
Won't be long before no horses
will be allowed on these roads.

01:49:53.723 --> 01:49:57.990
Would you mind moving out
of the road so that I might pass?

01:50:19.949 --> 01:50:21.110
Ma'am.

01:50:26.255 --> 01:50:30.158
It's the 20th century, Walsh.
Stay out of the way of progress.

01:50:31.527 --> 01:50:33.325
I believe I will.

01:50:33.997 --> 01:50:35.989
Damn thing stinks worse than goats.

01:50:49.646 --> 01:50:52.172
Damn near gave up hope
of ever seeing you again.

01:50:52.415 --> 01:50:54.816
How long's it been, five years?

01:50:55.084 --> 01:50:57.053
More like seven.

01:50:57.387 --> 01:50:59.219
Where you been?

01:50:59.689 --> 01:51:01.055
Well...

01:51:01.691 --> 01:51:05.093
...rode down to Texas
and up to Canada and back again.

01:51:05.361 --> 01:51:07.762
Trick was seeing if I could get paid for it.

01:51:08.031 --> 01:51:09.556
And did you?

01:51:10.066 --> 01:51:11.932
Some of the time.

01:51:18.508 --> 01:51:22.809
- You wiped out them flies yet, killer?
- The battle's changed, Monte.

01:51:23.046 --> 01:51:26.847
We've made significant
progress in the technology.

01:51:28.951 --> 01:51:31.750
Sure seen a lot of
fenced-in land around here.

01:51:32.555 --> 01:51:35.354
- Consolidated.
- Figures.

01:51:36.492 --> 01:51:38.290
What are they doing with it?

01:51:38.528 --> 01:51:42.363
Nothing, but those accountants
don't buy things for nothing.

01:51:43.199 --> 01:51:46.363
- What are they doing with you?
- Nothing.

01:51:46.602 --> 01:51:48.628
They fired me.

01:51:51.674 --> 01:51:52.972
Figures.

01:51:53.209 --> 01:51:56.907
- What do I owe you?
- Those are a nickel now, Monte.

01:52:02.485 --> 01:52:03.612
Here.

01:52:04.854 --> 01:52:06.516
Might wanna take this along.

01:52:06.789 --> 01:52:08.655
Snakebite.

01:52:10.193 --> 01:52:11.286
Thanks, Bob.

01:52:20.436 --> 01:52:23.372
- Ain't fixing to stay?
- Too many fences.

01:52:24.273 --> 01:52:26.469
Too many automobiles.

01:52:27.610 --> 01:52:31.274
Figured I'd stop by Harmony,
pay Chet a visit.

01:52:32.115 --> 01:52:36.143
There ain't no Harmony anymore.
Just a ghost town now.

01:52:36.385 --> 01:52:38.820
It's only a ghost I care about.

01:52:43.893 --> 01:52:45.122
Hey, mister!

01:52:45.595 --> 01:52:47.621
Are you a real cowboy?

01:52:51.667 --> 01:52:53.363
Yes, I am.

01:52:53.603 --> 01:52:56.368
Could you teach me how to rope?

01:52:56.606 --> 01:52:58.734
Well, son, I'm fixing to leave...

01:52:58.975 --> 01:53:00.705
...but that man there...

01:53:00.943 --> 01:53:03.276
...he can teach you to rope.

01:53:05.114 --> 01:53:07.049
He's a cowboy too.

01:53:08.551 --> 01:53:10.042
Cal.

01:54:06.175 --> 01:54:07.905
There's that cowboy.

01:54:09.879 --> 01:54:13.008
Monte! Hey, Monte!

01:54:17.753 --> 01:54:19.619
My, oh, my.

01:54:21.591 --> 01:54:24.083
You could think about
helping us out of this mess.

01:54:24.360 --> 01:54:25.760
I could.

01:54:26.529 --> 01:54:28.794
Well, maybe you could pull us out.

01:54:29.031 --> 01:54:30.829
I could.

01:54:33.402 --> 01:54:38.170
How about it? We've got to get into town
before dark. I can't budge this damn thing!

01:54:38.407 --> 01:54:39.807
You know something?

01:54:40.076 --> 01:54:43.604
I seem to have forgotten
your first name, Mr. Slocumb.

01:54:44.680 --> 01:54:47.616
- It's Robert.
- Robert.

01:54:49.151 --> 01:54:52.815
You can't have no idea
how little I care.

01:56:43.666 --> 01:56:44.599
