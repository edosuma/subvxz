Courtney's right.
We've got to lay low until
we're trained and ready.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.411
Courtney's right.
We've got to lay low until
we're trained and ready.

17:53.443 --> 17:54.000
-Do we suit up, or--
-Not yet, Rick.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.547
-Do we suit up, or--
-Not yet, Rick.

17:55.579 --> 17:56.000
I've been working all day
on something special for
you guys.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000

17:58.516 --> 18:00.000
We need to go over
two crucial categories.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.751
We need to go over
two crucial categories.

18:01.785 --> 18:02.000
One, what you guys can do,

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
One, what you guys can do,

18:04.000 --> 18:04.388
One, what you guys can do,

18:04.422 --> 18:06.000
and two,
what the bad guys can do.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.791
and two,
what the bad guys can do.

18:07.826 --> 18:08.000
We know what we can do.
I can hit things hard.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
We know what we can do.
I can hit things hard.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.528
We know what we can do.
I can hit things hard.

Beth can talk.
About everything.

18:16.000 --> 18:16.799
Beth can talk.
About everything.

18:16.834 --> 18:17.935
Happy to!

18:17.969 --> 18:18.000
And Courtney has a glow stick
that blows things up.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
And Courtney has a glow stick
that blows things up.

18:20.000 --> 18:20.337
And Courtney has a glow stick
that blows things up.

18:20.371 --> 18:22.000
But you still don't know how
to work together as a team.

18:22.000 --> 18:22.773
But you still don't know how
to work together as a team.

18:22.807 --> 18:24.000
Teamwork is what made

to become great.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
But it took time for them
to become great.

18:30.000 --> 18:30.448
But it took time for them
to become great.

18:30.480 --> 18:32.000
And still, with all that
skill and talent,

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
And still, with all that
skill and talent,

18:34.000 --> 18:34.951
And still, with all that
skill and talent,

18:34.984 --> 18:36.000
they weren't able to survive.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.954
they weren't able to survive.

18:37.988 --> 18:38.000
So I just want you kids

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
So I just want you kids

18:40.000 --> 18:40.324
So I just want you kids

18:40.357 --> 18:42.000

19:24.000 --> 19:24.035
[Crusher] So,
our man comes out the door,

19:24.068 --> 19:26.000
I hit him with three baseballs
in quick succession,

19:26.000 --> 19:27.900
I hit him with three baseballs
in quick succession,

19:27.900 --> 19:28.000
and he goes down.

19:28.000 --> 19:28.772
and he goes down.

19:28.772 --> 19:30.000
[man] Thanks for
the play-by-play,

19:30.000 --> 19:30.374
[man] Thanks for
the play-by-play,

19:30.407 --> 19:31.442
but who are they?

19:31.442 --> 19:32.000
They can't just come
from nowhere.

19:32.000 --> 19:32.509
They can't just come
from nowhere.

19:32.509 --> 19:33.911
They have to come
from somewhere.

19:33.943 --> 19:34.000
I'm telling you,

19:34.000 --> 19:35.480
I'm telling you,

19:35.512 --> 19:36.000
I think they were all
just kids.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.914
I think they were all
just kids.

19:37.948 --> 19:38.000
They were kids.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.651
They were kids.

19:39.683 --> 19:40.000
Except maybe that big robot.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.384
Except maybe that big robot.

19:41.419 --> 19:42.000
Then we should bring
our children into this.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.186
Then we should bring
our children into this.

19:43.220 --> 19:44.000
-They could help us find them.
-No.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.089
-They could help us find them.
-No.

19:45.123 --> 19:46.000
We agreed to keep our sons
and daughters in the dark.

You coddle him.
That's your problem, not his.

19:55.132 --> 19:56.000
How can you not be worried?

19:56.000 --> 19:57.434
How can you not be worried?

19:57.468 --> 19:58.000
This new JSA could already know
who we are.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.671
This new JSA could already know
who we are.

19:59.703 --> 20:00.000
No, if they knew
our true identity,

20:00.000 --> 20:01.172
No, if they knew
our true identity,

20:01.204 --> 20:02.000
then they'd come
for us already.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.173
then they'd come
for us already.

20:03.207 --> 20:04.000
Keep looking for them
while I'm gone.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.042
Keep looking for them
while I'm gone.

20:05.042 --> 20:06.000
I have facial recognition
programs working overtime.

But his days are numbered.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.330
But his days are numbered.

20:27.330 --> 20:28.000
The staff and I
went after him before,

20:28.000 --> 20:28.799
The staff and I
went after him before,

20:28.799 --> 20:30.000
and that's when I barely knew
how to use it.

20:30.000 --> 20:30.500
and that's when I barely knew
how to use it.

20:30.500 --> 20:32.000
But you still have
a lot to learn.

20:32.000 --> 20:32.569
But you still have

21:00.431 --> 21:02.000
Okay. Let's talk about
some of our, uh,

more eccentric opponents.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.001
more eccentric opponents.

21:05.035 --> 21:06.000
Like the Gambler.

Well, can we speed this up?

21:28.000 --> 21:28.492
Well, can we speed this up?

21:28.492 --> 21:29.960
Who knows how many people
are being hurt

21:29.961 --> 21:30.000
because we're not out there
right this second.

if they still control him.

21:42.339 --> 21:43.907
My point is,

21:43.942 --> 21:44.000
rushing to confront them again
is too risky.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
rushing to confront them again
is too risky.

21:46.000 --> 21:46.443
rushing to confront them again

Darn it, Court,

22:11.903 --> 22:12.000
this exercise
wasn't just for you.

I just don't know
how to ask her.

27:42.900 --> 27:44.000
When you really like someone,
it's never easy.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
When you really like someone,

28:16.233 --> 28:18.000
When I finally got the courage
to speak with her,

28:18.000 --> 28:18.469
When I finally got the courage
