-Oh, I just got
a text from Jane.

00:18.718 --> 00:22.154
But I can't read it.
It's, like, super tiny.

00:22.189 --> 00:25.390
Why in the world would Jane be
sending you a super tiny text?

00:25.425 --> 00:29.027
Jane:
Help! Somebody help us!

00:29.062 --> 00:31.997
Okay, I refuse
to wait any longer.

00:32.032 --> 00:33.665
The Jewel-bilee must begin.

00:33.700 --> 00:36.401
And more importantly,
my big number must go on.

00:36.436 --> 00:38.837

-Aah!

01:14.341 --> 01:16.708
Hello, Auradon.

01:16.743 --> 01:18.810
What is the meaning of this?

01:18.845 --> 01:21.413
Do you know how long
I worked on this number?

01:21.448 --> 01:23.048
Oh, I didn't realize.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.217
It's so hard
to see from outside.

01:25.252 --> 01:28.386
You know, time it just right.
It's really just
a roll of the dice.

01:28.421 --> 01:30.155
I'm sure it's gonna be
a great little song and dance.

01:30.190 --> 01:31.323
Your folks will be proud.

01:31.358 --> 01:32.924
Aww, thanks.

01:32.959 --> 01:34.326
The good news, however,

01:34.361 --> 01:36.161
is that you all
have a front row seat

01:36.196 --> 01:38.463
for the coming
Revolt-olution!

01:38.498 --> 01:40.966
Okay, that's far enough.

01:41.001 --> 01:42.734
Pa-pow!

01:42.769 --> 01:44.836
(groaning)

01:44.871 --> 01:46.872
Let's agree to disagree.

01:51.111 --> 01:53.512
(gasps)
No! Not the jewels!

01:53.547 --> 01:55.447
Haha!

01:58.385 --> 02:00.485
For those of you
who are still confused,

02:00.520 --> 02:03.255
I don't mind making
this crystal clear.

02:03.290 --> 02:06.191
Once I fuse
all the stones together,

02:06.226 --> 02:09.528
this staff will be
more powerful than a magic wand.

02:09.563 --> 02:11.096
Then that's
not gonna happen.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.464
Ka-blooey!

02:12.499 --> 02:13.966
Whoa!

02:15.302 --> 02:16.301
Ba-bam!

02:17.971 --> 02:19.938
-(screaming)
-(laughing)

02:19.973 --> 02:21.673
That's just one jewel.

02:21.708 --> 02:23.475
Once I've combined them all,

02:23.510 --> 02:25.644
I will rule
all of Auradon.

02:25.679 --> 02:26.678
(all gasp)

02:26.713 --> 02:28.046
Oh, no!

02:28.081 --> 02:30.148
(laughing)

02:30.183 --> 02:31.483
Buh-bye!
