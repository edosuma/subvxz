00:38.160 --> 00:39.120
[LESLIE] CHRISTIAN'S TOX SCREEN

[BARTENDER] THERE WAS ONE.

00:46.130 --> 00:47.170
[JAKE] DID THEY HIT IT OFF?

00:47.170 --> 00:49.090

HUSBAND IS TOMMY WINDSOR, OF THE

01:08.520 --> 01:10.190

01:16.360 --> 01:18.820

01:20.740 --> 01:21.700

05:26.740 --> 05:27.570
[JAKE] WE'VE GOT A SLIGHTLY

05:27.570 --> 05:28.530
BIGGER PROBLEM RIGHT NOW, LIKE

05:28.530 --> 05:29.910
WHO KILLED TOMMY WINDSOR.

05:29.910 --> 05:30.910
[MAL] WELL IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN

05:30.910 --> 05:31.780
CHRISTIAN.

05:31.790 --> 05:32.580
[ROSE] TOMMY WINDSOR HAD HIS

05:32.580 --> 05:33.450
SHARE OF ENEMIES, LIKE THERE'S

05:33.450 --> 05:34.500
DESTINY, THE WORKING GIRL.

05:34.500 --> 05:35.460
[MAL] SHE HELPED FRAME

05:38.380 --> 05:39.500
[ROSE] YEAH, AND THAT PROBABLY

05:39.500 --> 05:40.670
TURNED SOUR.

05:40.670 --> 05:41.630
[MAL] AND THEN THERE'S A WHOLE

05:41.630 --> 05:42.500
SLEW OF INVESTORS WHO TOMMY

05:42.510 --> 05:43.500
RIPPED OFF IN HIS LAND DEALS,

05:43.510 --> 05:44.380
SOMEONE IN THERE COULD BE

05:44.380 --> 05:45.550
LOOKING FOR BLOOD.

05:45.550 --> 05:46.550
[ROSE] WHAT ABOUT BARTLETT AND

05:46.550 --> 05:47.430
MORGAN, HIS OLD LAW FIRM, I

05:47.430 --> 05:49.090

05:49.100 --> 05:50.010
HIM.
[MAL] WHAT DID HE SAY TO YOU,

05:50.010 --> 05:50.970
WHEN YOU SAW HIM?

05:50.970 --> 05:51.930
[JAKE] HE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT A

05:51.930 --> 05:53.180
SILENT PARTNER, BUT HONESTLY, HE

05:53.180 --> 05:54.720
WAS ACTING LIKE A CRAZY PERSON.

05:54.730 --> 05:55.770
HE WAS DIGGING THROUGH TOMMY

[JAKE] YEAH, HE SAID THE SILENT

06:01.230 --> 06:02.270
PARTNER COULD CLEAR HIS NAME.
[MAL] IF THERE'S A SILENT

06:02.280 --> 06:03.400
PARTNER, TOMMY WINDSOR WOULD

06:03.400 --> 06:04.530
HAVE BEEN THE ONLY ONE WHO KNEW

06:04.530 --> 06:05.570
WHO THEY WERE.

06:05.570 --> 06:06.440
[JAKE] WELL, WE ALL KNOW WHAT

06:06.450 --> 06:07.360
HAPPENED TO HIM.

06:07.360 --> 06:08.280

06:12.370 --> 06:15.450
JAKE, DO YOU THINK CHRISTIAN

06:15.460 --> 06:17.080
COULD HAVE DONE THIS? COULD HE

06:17.080 --> 06:19.580

39:56.600 --> 39:58.270

39:58.270 --> 39:59.520
AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF

39:59.520 --> 40:00.980
PEOPLE GET CAUGHT BECAUSE THEY

40:00.980 --> 40:02.440
ACTUALLY THROW THE MURDER WEAPON

40:02.440 --> 40:04.650
IN THEIR OWN GARBAGE. 260

40:04.650 --> 40:06.020
THOUSAND DOLLARS, THAT'S A LOT

40:06.030 --> 40:07.360
OF MONEY. MUST HAVE BEEN QUITE A

40:07.360 --> 40:08.570
STING WHEN TOMMY WINDSOR RIPPED

40:08.570 --> 40:10.190
OFF YOUR NEST EGG. PRETTY SURE

40:19.790 --> 40:20.870
[TRUDY SPENCER] I DIDN'T GO

40:20.870 --> 40:22.000
THERE TO KILL HIM. I REALLY

40:22.000 --> 40:23.040
THOUGHT HE'D GIVE ME MY MONEY

40:23.040 --> 40:24.120
BACK.

40:24.130 --> 40:25.250
[JAKE] YOU EARNED THAT MONEY THE

40:25.250 --> 40:33.630
HARD WAY, HUH?

40:33.640 --> 40:34.760
[TRUDY SPENCER] TOMMY SAID HE

40:34.760 --> 40:35.720
WAS TRYING TO GET IT BACK, BUT I

40:35.720 --> 40:37.720
KNEW HE WAS LYING. IN THE

40:37.720 --> 40:39.310
MEANTIME, HE SAID "HERE'S 250

40:39.310 --> 40:40.560
DOLLARS" AND HE SLID IT ACROSS

40:40.560 --> 40:41.930
THE DESK TO ME FOR OLD TIME'S

40:41.940 --> 40:43.440
SAKE.

40:43.440 --> 40:44.520
[JAKE] HE'S A CLASS ACT, THAT

40:44.520 --> 40:46.900
TOMMY WINDSOR.

40:46.900 --> 40:48.070
[TRUDY SPENCER] I HIT HIM BEFORE

40:48.070 --> 40:49.320
I KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING. HE

40:49.320 --> 40:50.440
THREW THE CHAIR AT ME AND IT

40:50.440 --> 40:51.650
WENT OUT THE WINDOW, AND THEN HE

40:51.650 --> 40:52.700
LUNGED AT ME AGAIN, AND I HIT

40:52.700 --> 40:54.490
HIM AGAIN, AND HE STUMBLED BACK,

40:54.490 --> 40:56.570
AND HE JUST FELL OUT.

40:56.580 --> 41:02.710
[JAKE] UM, TRUDY, YOU DON'T HAVE

41:02.710 --> 41:04.670
A LOT OF OPTIONS HERE. I'M

41:04.670 --> 41:05.880

41:08.170 --> 41:09.750
