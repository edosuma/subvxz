00:03.003 --> 00:04.796
Amy: Previously on "Heartland":

00:04.838 --> 00:05.880
- What kind of person
would kill one of these

00:05.922 --> 00:07.298
just for sport?

00:07.340 --> 00:09.259
- Dumbass people
with too much money.

00:09.300 --> 00:10.468
- I called this guy
I used to work for.

00:10.510 --> 00:12.012
He works with Veterinarians
Without Borders.

00:12.053 --> 00:15.348
This Gobi bear, she's become
a top priority for them,
especially now.

00:15.390 --> 00:17.851
He says he can send us there
in a heartbeat, me and you.

00:17.892 --> 00:19.728
- So you could actually
go over there

00:19.769 --> 00:21.271
and help save their lives?

00:21.312 --> 00:22.564
- Yeah.

00:26.192 --> 00:27.360
(Brochure rustles)

00:27.402 --> 00:29.612
- What's this?
- Oh, that's nothing.

00:29.654 --> 00:33.241
- Um, have you talked to her
about Mongolia yet?

00:37.078 --> 00:39.497
- No, I haven't talked to her,
'cause I'm not going.

00:42.542 --> 00:43.626
(Insects buzz)

00:43.668 --> 00:45.503
Amy: We don't have to do this
yet, Grandpa.

00:45.545 --> 00:47.672
We won't even need a new truck
for months.

00:47.714 --> 00:49.007
Ty: No, we should go and look.

00:49.049 --> 00:51.384
I'm hearing it from all sides,
Amy.

00:51.426 --> 00:53.470
Amy: Don't listen to everyone.
This is your decision.

00:53.511 --> 00:55.138
This is OUR decision.

00:55.180 --> 00:58.558
Jack: Let's just have a look.
It's not gonna hurt anything.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.810
Amy: Grandpa, you have to stop.
Jack: Stop what?

01:00.852 --> 01:02.854
Amy: You have to stop
the truck.

01:02.896 --> 01:04.397
Stop the truck.

01:05.815 --> 01:07.776
(Truck rumbles to a halt,
engine idles)

01:07.817 --> 01:10.987
(Door opens,
Amy blows out her breath)

01:11.029 --> 01:12.614
(Breathing heavily)

01:14.074 --> 01:17.702
- (Exhales sharply) I still
feel sick when we drive.

01:17.744 --> 01:20.330
When is that gonna stop?

01:20.372 --> 01:22.082
- Do you want uh...

01:22.123 --> 01:23.875
Do you want some candies
to suck on or ginger ale?

01:23.917 --> 01:26.044
- Um... Ginger ale would be
great.

01:26.086 --> 01:27.629
- Are you okay?
- Yup, I'm good.

01:29.714 --> 01:30.799
All good.
(Pop tab snaps)

01:32.425 --> 01:34.219
(Exhales forcefully)
Ugh...

01:36.721 --> 01:39.432
- Table 4? Burgers? Burgers.

01:39.474 --> 01:40.975
They're not getting any hotter.
Thanks.

01:41.017 --> 01:44.354
Jade: Tim! If you'll just
listen to us for one second.

01:44.396 --> 01:45.855
Lou's away, we know
you're going crazy,

01:45.897 --> 01:48.650
and we can help you.
- And you can help us!

01:48.692 --> 01:50.485
We wanna make some money
and we've got the schedule
right here.

01:50.527 --> 01:51.695
We planned it all out.

01:51.736 --> 01:53.113
- Yeah, I'm sure you have,
but I don't have time

01:53.154 --> 01:54.906
to babysit you
and teach you the ropes.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.449
- I have worked at Maggie's
before.

01:56.491 --> 01:58.410
- Well, I can't afford
what you want.

01:58.451 --> 01:59.828
- It's not even minimum wage!

01:59.869 --> 02:01.079
- You've got rodeo school.

02:01.121 --> 02:02.664
You've got Extreme Team
and school.

02:02.706 --> 02:03.832
How're you gonna fit that in?

02:03.873 --> 02:05.667
- If you'd just look
at the schedule,

02:05.709 --> 02:06.584
you'll see how it all fits.

02:06.626 --> 02:08.169
- I'm not gonna look at
your schedule.

02:08.211 --> 02:09.795
I don't have time to look
at your schedule--
- (Bell dings) Order up!

02:09.838 --> 02:11.381
- I'm too busy to look
at your schedule.

02:11.423 --> 02:12.882
- And that's why you need us!

02:12.924 --> 02:14.467
We'll make your life easier.

02:14.509 --> 02:15.927
- No, you'll make my life
harder.

02:15.969 --> 02:18.471
(Cell phone rings, Tim grunts)

02:19.639 --> 02:22.475
- Oh. Casey, yeah. What is it?

02:22.517 --> 02:25.353
I mean, hi. No, no, no,
I'm fi--

02:25.395 --> 02:27.856
What attitude? I...

02:27.897 --> 02:30.275
Is everything all right?

02:30.316 --> 02:32.193
(Truck rumbles)

02:37.032 --> 02:38.199
(Engine shuts off)

02:39.492 --> 02:40.994
- You know, Jack, you really
didn't have to come.

02:41.036 --> 02:44.039
- (Laughs) Oh yes, I did.
(Doors bang shut)

02:44.080 --> 02:47.125
No offence, Ty, but...
you're a bit green,

02:47.167 --> 02:50.837
so promise you'll take my lead
on this.

02:50.879 --> 02:53.548
You have to walk away
from these guys,

02:53.590 --> 02:54.966
no matter what they say.

02:55.008 --> 02:57.177
Woman over PA:
Call on line 2. Line 2.

02:57.218 --> 03:00.055
- You okay? (Phone rings)
- Yeah, I'm good.

03:00.096 --> 03:03.183
Bob again? Are you not gonna
answer it?

03:03.224 --> 03:05.518
- Ah, I'll just call him back.
- Oh, uh, I forgot to tell you.

03:05.560 --> 03:06.895
He came by this morning
looking for you.

03:06.936 --> 03:09.314
I... Baby brain.

03:09.356 --> 03:11.107
- That's okay.

03:11.149 --> 03:13.443
- Are you avoiding him?

03:13.485 --> 03:14.819
- No, I'm not avoiding him.

03:14.861 --> 03:17.113
- Ty, I think you are.
It's been days now.

03:17.155 --> 03:19.449
- I've just had... other things
on my mind, that's all.

03:19.491 --> 03:21.201
- 'Kay.

03:21.242 --> 03:23.286
Salesman: Well, that truck
of yours,

03:23.328 --> 03:26.790
now there's a relic you don't
see on the road very often.

03:26.831 --> 03:28.708
Thinking about upgrading
to something new,

03:28.750 --> 03:30.877
like maybe a 1990's model?
(Chuckles)

03:32.754 --> 03:34.506
So... what can I show you
nice folks?

03:35.840 --> 03:38.093
(Plate clanks)
- There you go.

03:38.134 --> 03:40.929
Hey. Guys, I-I have to leave.

03:40.970 --> 03:42.681
Something's come up with one
of Casey's horses.

03:42.722 --> 03:44.349
I-I'm very sorry.

03:46.017 --> 03:47.811
- We can take over for you.

03:47.852 --> 03:49.729
- Yeah, then you'll totally see
that we can handle it.

03:51.356 --> 03:55.568
- Okay. Only for an hour, and
that doesn't mean you're hired.

03:55.610 --> 03:56.945
(Music plays quietly,
diners chatter)

03:56.986 --> 03:57.987
(Truck rumbles)

03:58.029 --> 04:00.990
Salesman: So you're expecting.
Congrats!

04:01.032 --> 04:04.869
Well, this is the most reliable
truck you could ever want.

04:04.911 --> 04:07.455
Amy: Ty, just... stop the truck,
please.

04:07.497 --> 04:09.249
Ugh. I... I gotta get out.

04:09.290 --> 04:12.627
(Truck rumbles to a stop,
Door clicks open)

04:14.045 --> 04:15.547
Ugh!

04:16.755 --> 04:18.841
(Unzips cooler)
- Just breathe, Amy.

04:18.882 --> 04:21.678
Just breathe.
Here, have a sip of this.

04:21.720 --> 04:22.929
(Door shuts, pop tab snaps)

04:22.971 --> 04:24.055
- Thanks.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.016
Salesman: Lots of space, right?

04:26.057 --> 04:28.476
Jack: No more space than
any other truck.

04:28.518 --> 04:29.728
- Now, that's where
you're wrong, sir.

04:29.769 --> 04:31.354
I can show you a comparison
sheet.

04:31.396 --> 04:32.981
- (Gagging)

04:33.023 --> 04:34.816
- Uh... t-take your time.

04:35.984 --> 04:38.403
No need to hurry back
to the truck.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.155
No need to hurry at all.

04:40.196 --> 04:42.615
- (Sighs)
- It's okay.

04:42.657 --> 04:44.576
(Truck rumbles to a stop)

04:46.036 --> 04:48.496
(Doors click open)

04:50.874 --> 04:52.208
(Doors bang shut)

04:52.250 --> 04:54.878
Salesman: Now, this looks like
a brand new truck, right?

04:54.919 --> 04:57.756
Well, I'm not gonna lie to you,
it's not.

04:57.797 --> 05:00.467
It's about a year old, but it's
got hardly any mileage on it.

05:00.508 --> 05:02.802
It was a weekend cowboy
that owned it -

05:02.844 --> 05:04.971
that is until the oil slump
came along

05:05.013 --> 05:07.807
and he had to give up
that nice little hobby.

05:07.849 --> 05:09.768
Well, I don't think you're
gonna find a better deal.

05:09.809 --> 05:11.394
I promise you.

05:11.436 --> 05:13.396
(Paper rustles)
Woman over PA: Tom, you got
a call on line 3.

05:13.438 --> 05:14.689
Line 3.

05:14.731 --> 05:16.191
- You know, to sweeten
the deal,

05:16.232 --> 05:18.151
I might be able to give you
something for that truck.

05:18.193 --> 05:20.153
Maybe it's a collector's item,
right?

05:20.195 --> 05:22.364
- Not interested.
(Paper rustles)

05:23.656 --> 05:25.784
- Well, let's see how she runs.

05:25.825 --> 05:27.744
- She runs just fine.

05:27.786 --> 05:28.953
Let's go! (Door bangs shut)

05:28.995 --> 05:30.288
- Thanks for your time.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.332
(Engine stutters
and won't start)

05:39.631 --> 05:42.384
(Truck rumbles,
Cell phone rings)

05:47.514 --> 05:49.140
(Snorts)

05:49.182 --> 05:51.559
- Ty, yeah. What's up?

05:51.601 --> 05:53.645
What do you mean?

05:53.687 --> 05:55.021
Yeah, I'm busy.

05:56.940 --> 05:59.567
No. No, I'm on my way
to Casey's.

05:59.609 --> 06:01.903
Wha-What?
You gotta be kidding me.

06:03.154 --> 06:05.699
Well... where are you?

06:05.740 --> 06:07.951
(Truck rumbles by)

06:07.992 --> 06:10.662
Ty: We were test-driving
a truck just like you said.

06:10.704 --> 06:11.996
- Oh, so this is my fault now.

06:12.038 --> 06:13.623
- We wouldn't have called you,

06:13.665 --> 06:15.834
but these dummies
can't find any cables.

06:15.875 --> 06:18.003
What kind of a car lot doesn't
have jumper cables?!

06:18.044 --> 06:19.879
- What're you doing here anyway?

06:19.921 --> 06:21.673
I'm the one that knows how
to drive a hard bargain.

06:21.715 --> 06:24.300
- Oh really? Well, I'm probably
the one who taught you.

06:24.342 --> 06:25.385
(Door slams shut)
- Okay. You know what?

06:25.427 --> 06:27.470
This is why we wanted
to do this on our own

06:27.512 --> 06:28.805
in the first place.

06:28.847 --> 06:31.182
- Okay, fine,
so you don't need my help.

06:31.224 --> 06:32.392
- It's the blind leading
the blind here.

06:32.434 --> 06:35.145
I told you guys, get rid
of your trucks. Trade 'em in!

06:35.186 --> 06:37.522
- My truck is perfectly
all right!

06:37.564 --> 06:39.315
- Let's see.
(Engine turns)

06:39.357 --> 06:41.151
- See? Perfectly all right.

06:41.192 --> 06:43.820
And you can put those cables
somewhere else.

06:43.862 --> 06:45.405
(Hood bangs shut)
- Fantastic. Let's go.

06:45.447 --> 06:47.365
Casey's waiting for me.
I'm gonna be in trouble.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.743
- Hey, we better go get this
battery checked.

06:49.784 --> 06:51.619
- Ugh! I cannot drive around
any more.

06:51.661 --> 06:53.079
Dad, can I come with you?

06:53.121 --> 06:54.706
- Yeah. You're not gonna throw
up in my truck though, right?

06:54.748 --> 06:56.791
- Got my ginger ale.
- I'm gonna go with Amy.

06:56.833 --> 06:59.627
(Engine starts,
Truck rumbles away)

07:01.838 --> 07:04.591
- Hey! You forgot to take
my card!

07:04.632 --> 07:14.684
**

07:14.684 --> 07:20.190
**

07:20.231 --> 07:25.987
* And at the break of day
you sank into your dream *

07:27.238 --> 07:28.782
* You dreamer... *

07:28.823 --> 07:30.158
* Oh, oh, oh, oh... *

07:31.368 --> 07:33.495
* You dreamer... *

07:35.580 --> 07:38.833
* You dreamer... *

07:46.049 --> 07:49.511
(Truck rumbles to a stop)

07:55.392 --> 07:56.643
(Doors bang shut)

07:56.685 --> 07:59.688
Tim: Thanks for driving over.
- What took you so long?

07:59.729 --> 08:01.981
- Mm. Don't ask. I'm here.

08:02.023 --> 08:05.026
You okay?
- (Sighs) Not really.

08:05.068 --> 08:07.070
Thanks you, guys. Tim said
you'd take a look at my horse.

08:07.112 --> 08:09.489
- Oh!
- Do you mind?

08:09.531 --> 08:12.117
- Uh, no, we don't mind. Yeah,
it's the first we heard of it.

08:12.158 --> 08:13.910
What seems to be the problem?

08:13.952 --> 08:16.371
- Uh, he's, uh, just suddenly
stopped eating.

08:16.413 --> 08:19.290
It's been three days and...
he loves his food.

08:19.332 --> 08:20.834
I took him to my vet,

08:20.875 --> 08:23.378
but they couldn't find anything
wrong with him.

08:23.420 --> 08:25.213
He's just not acting like
himself, not by a long shot,

08:25.255 --> 08:26.464
and I'm really worried.

08:26.506 --> 08:27.716
- Okay, well,
we can check him out.

08:27.757 --> 08:29.926
- Yeah? Okay.

08:29.968 --> 08:32.261
All right, I'm sorry,
I gotta get back to Maggie's.

08:32.303 --> 08:34.179
You're welcome.
- Thanks, Dad.

08:34.222 --> 08:36.015
- Next time you go to buy
a truck, take an expert!

08:37.100 --> 08:38.559
(Door clicks open)

08:39.936 --> 08:42.147
(Cody exhales sharply)

08:42.188 --> 08:45.233
Ty: There's nothing visibly
wrong,

08:45.275 --> 08:48.570
There's no lumps on his neck,
no swelling.

08:50.989 --> 08:53.992
Hmm. I'm gonna have some
X-rays done.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.744
- I'll help you.

08:55.785 --> 08:57.370
- No way, Amy. You're pregnant.

08:57.412 --> 08:59.080
You can't go anywhere near
an X-ray machine.

08:59.122 --> 09:00.373
- (Sighs) Right.

09:00.415 --> 09:02.459
- I'll call Scott,
he'll give me a hand.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.753
- My vet did an X-ray,
but like I said,

09:04.794 --> 09:06.212
he didn't find anything.

09:06.254 --> 09:09.924
- Well, it doesn't hurt
to double check.

09:09.966 --> 09:11.760
Do you think he can stay here
overnight?

09:13.053 --> 09:14.596
- (Hesitant) Yeah, I guess so.

09:16.097 --> 09:17.140
Georgie: Awesome.
Jade: We'll see you soon.

09:17.182 --> 09:19.392
Man: Uh-huh.
Georgie: Enjoy.

09:19.434 --> 09:21.186
Man: Hey, Tim.
- Hi.

09:22.562 --> 09:26.316
(Music plays in diner,
diners chatter)

09:26.358 --> 09:27.942
- Are you impressed?

09:27.984 --> 09:29.694
- I'm surprised.

09:30.820 --> 09:33.031
Jade: So...? Are we hired?

09:36.201 --> 09:38.161
- No floods, no fires,
no poisoned customers -

09:38.203 --> 09:39.829
that's a good sign.

09:39.871 --> 09:43.041
- What we bring to this place
is fresh eyes.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.876
- You're hired.

09:44.918 --> 09:47.837
But if you screw up
in any way...

09:47.879 --> 09:49.881
you're gone.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.841
(Girls giggle, pleased)

09:51.883 --> 09:55.053
Amy: Safe to come in?
Ty: Yeah, we're all done.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.305
- So what's going on?

09:57.347 --> 09:59.849
- Well, I guess my biggest fear
is that Casey's vet missed
something.

09:59.891 --> 10:02.519
- Like what?
Scott: Like a tumor.

10:02.560 --> 10:03.853
- It's like he can't swallow,

10:03.895 --> 10:05.647
and that's probably why
he's not eating.

10:05.689 --> 10:07.190
A tumor is the only thing
that we can think of

10:07.232 --> 10:09.150
that would cause that kind
of obstruction.

10:09.192 --> 10:12.529
- I sure hope it's not that.
Casey would be devastated.

10:12.570 --> 10:15.073
- I know.
- Well, let's take those back
to the clinic, look at them.

10:15.115 --> 10:16.950
- Okay. I'll follow you.

10:16.991 --> 10:18.034
- I'll go through my mom's
journals,

10:18.076 --> 10:19.327
see if there's anything
I can find.

10:19.369 --> 10:21.371
- Okay, thanks, Amy.
- Oh, Ty.

10:21.413 --> 10:23.456
(Phone buzzes and dings)

10:23.498 --> 10:25.458
Bob, again.

10:25.500 --> 10:27.752
Are you guys okay?

10:27.794 --> 10:29.254
- Yeah, yeah.

10:29.295 --> 10:30.547
- Maybe you should answer it.

10:30.588 --> 10:32.507
It might be important.

10:32.549 --> 10:34.926
- I'll just uh...
I'll talk to him later.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.012
- 'Kay.
- I'll be back as soon as
I can, all right?

10:40.974 --> 10:42.392
- Hey...

10:42.434 --> 10:45.103
You're gonna be okay.

10:46.229 --> 10:48.523
Scott: No sign of a tumor.

10:48.565 --> 10:50.483
- That's the good news.

10:50.525 --> 10:52.902
But there's obviously
something else going on.

10:52.944 --> 10:55.196
(Phone rings)
- I better get that.

10:56.448 --> 10:59.784
Bob. How's it going?
- It's going, brother.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.036
- Hey...

11:02.245 --> 11:03.955
What're you doing here?

11:03.997 --> 11:05.498
I told you I made up my mind.

11:05.540 --> 11:08.835
- I need to talk to you
and you're ignoring my calls.

11:08.877 --> 11:10.503
- Look, I got your texts,
all right?

11:10.545 --> 11:12.922
I know you want me to meet
with the Veterinarians Without
Borders guy,

11:12.964 --> 11:15.216
but there's no point.
- Yeah, there is.

11:15.258 --> 11:16.468
Look, I just got a call
from Gavin.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.178
Another bear was murdered
this week.

11:18.219 --> 11:21.306
That's two bears, man.
Two bears in two weeks,

11:21.348 --> 11:24.142
and she was pregnant.

11:24.184 --> 11:26.144
(Sighs) Look,
I know you said no,

11:26.186 --> 11:28.146
but you can't lose perspective.

11:28.188 --> 11:30.398
Gavin's pumped, and we're ideal
candidates for this.

11:30.440 --> 11:33.526
We're young, we don't mind
long hours, crappy conditions.

11:33.568 --> 11:36.279
He's coming into town tomorrow
especially to talk to us.

11:36.321 --> 11:38.990
You can't turn your back
on this.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.700
Have you talked to Amy?

11:40.742 --> 11:42.911
- No, I haven't,
'cause I'm not going.

11:42.952 --> 11:44.496
She needs me here.

11:44.537 --> 11:45.538
- So what are you gonna do?
Stay home,

11:45.580 --> 11:48.124
put in your hours here,
and wait for the baby?

11:48.166 --> 11:50.126
- Yeah. That's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

11:50.168 --> 11:51.461
And I'm gonna buy a new truck

11:51.503 --> 11:53.672
and I'm gonna be a responsible
father. Amy deserves that.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.382
- A new truck.
- Yes, a new truck.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.010
If... if I can afford it.

12:00.303 --> 12:02.555
And if I can't even afford
to buy a new truck,

12:02.597 --> 12:05.183
how can I afford to leave this
good paying job

12:05.225 --> 12:07.394
to head off to Mongolia
for months?

12:07.435 --> 12:10.355
I need all the money I can get
before this baby arrives.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.273
- You're going around
in circles.

12:12.315 --> 12:15.026
You gotta get it together.

12:15.068 --> 12:17.487
- Thanks for that advice, Bob.

12:17.529 --> 12:20.198
- Just talk to Amy. Please?

12:20.240 --> 12:21.408
If anyone in this whole world

12:21.449 --> 12:24.619
would understand
why you need to do this,

12:24.661 --> 12:26.788
she would.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.797
(Horse snorts)

12:37.590 --> 12:39.134
(Hooves clop)

12:40.552 --> 12:43.304
(Keyboard key clacks,
horse grunts)

12:45.432 --> 12:47.225
(Keyboard key clacks)

12:47.267 --> 12:49.144
(Approaching footsteps)

12:50.437 --> 12:52.480
- Guess what? Tim hired Jade
and I to come work at Maggie's!

12:52.522 --> 12:54.065
Isn't that great?

12:54.107 --> 12:55.275
(Birds chirp outside)

12:55.316 --> 12:57.402
Oh, so you know!
That's awesome!

12:57.444 --> 12:58.903
It was so hard to keep it
a secret!

12:58.945 --> 13:00.613
When did Ty tell you?

13:00.655 --> 13:02.282
- When did Ty tell me what?

13:04.242 --> 13:05.994
- Uh...

13:07.370 --> 13:09.164
(Duck quacks, birds chirp)

13:12.083 --> 13:14.419
Come on, Cody,
you've got to eat.

13:16.046 --> 13:18.006
No? We'll try later.

13:19.549 --> 13:21.968
(Gate creaks open,
bucket thunks)

13:23.970 --> 13:26.181
- So the X-rays,

13:27.307 --> 13:29.184
they're fine.

13:29.225 --> 13:30.393
There's no tumor,
the throat's clear,

13:30.435 --> 13:31.978
just like Casey's vet said.

13:32.020 --> 13:33.521
- Well, that's good news.

13:33.563 --> 13:34.731
- Yeah, it is great news.

13:34.773 --> 13:36.858
Um, how's he doing?

13:36.900 --> 13:39.611
- Well, much the same.
A little bit more relaxed.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.154
- Yeah?

13:41.196 --> 13:44.407
- Hey, Ty, is there something
that you wanna talk to me about?

13:44.449 --> 13:46.868
Something to do with Mongolia?

13:49.371 --> 13:51.373
- (Sighs) Bob didn't call you,
did he?

13:51.414 --> 13:52.874
- No.

13:54.626 --> 13:56.670
- Georgie told you.

13:56.711 --> 13:59.798
- Yeah, and I'm glad she did.
She filled me in on everything.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.216
- Well, I can't go, Amy.
I don't wanna leave you.

14:01.257 --> 14:02.217
I won't leave you.

14:02.258 --> 14:04.344
- We should at least talk
about this.

14:04.386 --> 14:06.262
- We don't need to 'cause
it's not happening.

14:06.304 --> 14:08.640
- Ty, we promised to tell each
other what was on our mind;

14:08.682 --> 14:10.684
to not keep secrets
from one another.

14:10.725 --> 14:12.519
You can't tell me that you
haven't been acting weird

14:12.560 --> 14:14.312
the last few days.
Avoiding Bob...

14:14.354 --> 14:15.605
- Of course I'm avoiding Bob.

14:15.647 --> 14:18.233
He wants me to go with him!
That's all he'll talk about!

14:18.274 --> 14:20.276
And now he's set up a meeting
with this Gavin guy

14:20.318 --> 14:22.320
from Veterinarians
Without Borders.

14:22.362 --> 14:23.822
Look, I can't go, Amy.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.365
It's the last thing
I should be doing!

14:25.407 --> 14:28.451
- Ty, this sounds like
an amazing opportunity.

14:28.493 --> 14:30.120
- It is, I know.

14:30.161 --> 14:31.830
And they need guys
like Bob and I.

14:31.871 --> 14:34.791
Believe me, I would be on a
plane like yesterday if I could.

14:34.833 --> 14:36.668
This trophy hunting crap
makes me crazy.

14:36.710 --> 14:38.378
- If this is something
you really wanna do,

14:38.420 --> 14:40.463
you should do it!

14:40.505 --> 14:43.174
- (Laughs) Amy, I can't go!

14:43.216 --> 14:44.676
You're pregnant! I'm not gonna
leave you here alone.

14:44.718 --> 14:46.011
What kind of guy would do that?

14:46.052 --> 14:48.138
- I'll be fine.

14:48.179 --> 14:51.307
- Amy, we both know things
that can happen,

14:51.349 --> 14:52.767
things that aren't planned.

14:52.809 --> 14:55.478
- I know. But I've got a lot
of people here

14:55.520 --> 14:57.689
who can help me out.

14:57.731 --> 14:59.607
If this is something
you wanna do,

14:59.649 --> 15:01.276
you should do it.

15:03.361 --> 15:05.155
- You're saying I should go?

15:05.196 --> 15:08.158
- You've supported
my dreams 100%.

15:08.199 --> 15:10.118
Why wouldn't I do the same
for you?

15:20.545 --> 15:21.463
(Birds chirp)

15:23.423 --> 15:26.092
(Rooster crows in the distance)

15:26.885 --> 15:28.636
(Ty sighs, bedding rustles)

15:30.597 --> 15:32.724
- Hey.

15:32.766 --> 15:34.392
Good morning.

15:34.434 --> 15:35.977
- Good morning.

15:38.355 --> 15:41.316
- Look, I know what we said
last night,

15:43.860 --> 15:46.196
- Ty--
- but I can't do it, Amy.

15:46.237 --> 15:47.947
Listen, okay?

15:49.282 --> 15:52.577
When I first heard about this,
honestly, I wanted to do it.

15:52.619 --> 15:55.246
I mean, how could I
just stand back

15:55.288 --> 15:57.082
and watch something
like this happen

15:57.123 --> 15:59.417
and not do anything about it?

16:00.877 --> 16:02.420
And I appreciate your support,
Amy,

16:02.462 --> 16:04.547
but I can't leave you.

16:04.589 --> 16:06.424
I don't wanna miss this.

16:08.635 --> 16:11.304
- Well... okay.

16:13.098 --> 16:16.893
But I don't think you should
make the decision that quick.

16:16.935 --> 16:19.437
I think you should, at least,
go and meet with that guy.

16:19.479 --> 16:20.980
- Who, Gavin?

16:22.023 --> 16:25.902
- Yeah, just...
see what he has to say.

16:25.944 --> 16:28.697
It might make the situation
a whole lot clearer.

16:31.241 --> 16:32.742
- (Sighs)

16:32.784 --> 16:34.369
(Harsh whinny)

16:35.453 --> 16:37.497
(Hard thud)

16:38.998 --> 16:41.543
(Thudding footsteps,
forced grunts)

16:45.463 --> 16:47.424
(Latch clicks)

16:47.465 --> 16:49.467
- Amy!

16:49.509 --> 16:51.052
Easy now, easy.

16:52.846 --> 16:54.431
Okay...

16:54.472 --> 16:55.807
This is bad.

16:55.849 --> 16:57.058
(Harsh whinny)

17:00.520 --> 17:02.731
- Here you go, sir.
- Thanks.

17:04.190 --> 17:05.567
This is deadly.

17:05.608 --> 17:06.776
If we're gonna be running
this place,

17:06.818 --> 17:07.944
we need to make it more fun.

17:07.986 --> 17:09.945
- We're not actually
running it.

17:09.988 --> 17:11.948
- Yeah, but we need
to make it cool.

17:11.990 --> 17:12.906
A place where our friends
wanna hang out.

17:12.949 --> 17:16.327
We need to change the music,
give it a vibe.

17:16.368 --> 17:18.413
- I don't think Tim's up
for a vibe.

17:18.454 --> 17:21.458
- Tim wouldn't realize what
a vibe was if he felt one.

17:21.499 --> 17:24.419
Remember what he said?
Fresh eyes.

17:24.461 --> 17:26.921
- Actually, you said that.

17:26.963 --> 17:28.882
- And I was right.

17:28.923 --> 17:32.010
(Country music plays,
diners chatter)

17:32.052 --> 17:35.305
- Ugh! Look at all this,
stuck in his throat.

17:35.347 --> 17:36.848
There's definitely a blockage.

17:36.890 --> 17:38.600
Casey: Hey! How's my boy doing?

17:38.641 --> 17:40.101
(Approaching footsteps)

17:41.353 --> 17:43.063
Oh my God. What's happening?

17:43.104 --> 17:44.689
- We looked for a tumor
in the X-ray.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.775
- A tumor?!
- No, there's no tumor!

17:46.816 --> 17:48.401
But there's something
definitely going on

17:48.443 --> 17:50.320
because there was a ton
of grass and hay

17:50.362 --> 17:51.863
stuck in his throat,
literally choking him.

17:51.905 --> 17:53.865
I got most of it out,
but he still can't swallow.

17:53.907 --> 17:55.325
- Can we do something?

17:55.367 --> 17:56.659
We can't have him choke
to death.

17:56.701 --> 17:58.495
- I promise that won't happen,
Casey, okay?

17:58.536 --> 17:59.537
I'm gonna give him
some antibiotics

17:59.579 --> 18:01.664
in case there's a risk
of aspiration pneumonia,

18:01.706 --> 18:02.540
and I'm gonna make sure
his throat is clear.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.501
But right now I need
to keep him calm.

18:04.542 --> 18:07.212
- C'mon, Casey.
Let's leave him to it.

18:07.253 --> 18:08.838
- (Worried sigh)

18:08.880 --> 18:10.882
(Cody groans)

18:10.924 --> 18:12.801
(Harness jingles, Cody grunts)

18:15.470 --> 18:17.847
I can't lose Cody.

18:17.889 --> 18:20.475
That horse has seen me
through everything.

18:21.935 --> 18:23.895
I was shy, he was shy.

18:23.937 --> 18:26.147
We gave each other confidence.

18:27.357 --> 18:29.567
Once I started riding him,

18:29.609 --> 18:31.903
I became top ranked
in the country,

18:31.945 --> 18:33.446
in the money at all
the big events.

18:33.488 --> 18:35.573
- That's amazing.
- It was.

18:36.908 --> 18:39.577
And he was as excited
about it as I was.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.871
He couldn't wait to race.

18:41.913 --> 18:44.249
Only thing we didn't compete
in was the Stampede,

18:44.290 --> 18:46.167
that was next.

18:47.752 --> 18:50.463
And then I met Hank.
We got married.

18:50.505 --> 18:53.508
I decided to help him
follow his dream

18:53.550 --> 18:55.176
of running his own rodeos.

18:56.428 --> 18:58.930
- So you gave up your dream.

18:58.972 --> 19:00.932
- No, I just...

19:00.974 --> 19:03.727
decided to quit barrel racing,
that's all.

19:03.768 --> 19:05.687
(Birds chirp)

19:13.486 --> 19:15.530
- You never made it to Stampede.

19:15.572 --> 19:16.865
- Nope.

19:18.867 --> 19:22.203
- Do you have... any regrets
about giving it up?

19:24.831 --> 19:27.792
- No... not really... I guess.

19:31.463 --> 19:34.382
It's a funny thing
about regrets.

19:34.424 --> 19:36.593
They just... pop into your head

19:36.634 --> 19:38.887
after years of not even
thinking about it at all.

19:40.430 --> 19:42.932
And those regrets usually
just...

19:42.974 --> 19:45.560
get bigger than they actually
were at the start.

19:47.812 --> 19:50.398
It's the one thing Hank and I
fought about years later.

19:52.067 --> 19:54.235
(Chuckles softly)
It's funny.

19:55.987 --> 19:59.741
(Birds chirp,
grass crunches underfoot)

20:03.828 --> 20:06.414
(Plastic tubing thunks,
Ty grunts)

20:08.625 --> 20:10.752
(Inhales and sighs)

20:10.794 --> 20:12.337
He's all clear now.

20:12.379 --> 20:13.963
- I can see that.

20:14.005 --> 20:15.256
You look exhausted.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.385
- (Sighs heavily) Yeah, I am.

20:20.512 --> 20:23.723
- Ty, I think we both got
cold feet this morning.

20:23.765 --> 20:25.850
If you don't follow your heart,
you are gonna regret it,

20:25.892 --> 20:28.478
and so will I
for holding you back.

20:28.520 --> 20:29.896
We will be fine.

20:29.938 --> 20:32.732
- Okay, Amy, can we just
drop it, okay?

20:32.774 --> 20:34.776
- No. Ty, think about it.

20:34.818 --> 20:36.528
Once this baby is born,

20:36.569 --> 20:38.196
you are not gonna be able
to go and do stuff like this

20:38.238 --> 20:40.448
because then I really
won't let you.

20:42.033 --> 20:44.953
So now is the time to do it.

20:46.037 --> 20:47.622
- (Chuckles softly)

20:52.419 --> 20:54.295
(Sighs heavily)

20:55.588 --> 20:56.631
(Birds Chirp)

20:57.966 --> 20:59.676
- So, Tim, tell everyone
how great

20:59.718 --> 21:01.177
Jade and I did at Maggie's
today.

21:01.219 --> 21:04.806
- Well, you didn't screw up.
(Jack chuckles)

21:04.848 --> 21:06.891
- It was fun.
- Yeah, well, we'll see
how much fun it is

21:06.933 --> 21:08.143
when you do it every day
of the week,

21:08.184 --> 21:09.936
every week of the summer.

21:09.978 --> 21:12.147
- It'll still be fun.
- Well, we'll see about that.

21:12.188 --> 21:14.733
- (Clears throat)
So, everyone, um...

21:14.774 --> 21:18.278
Ty and I have something
that we... want to tell you.

21:19.654 --> 21:22.490
- (Deep breath)
Yes. Um... So...

21:23.908 --> 21:28.038
I've been seriously considering
going to Mongolia.

21:28.079 --> 21:30.248
- Wow, Ty!
You're really doing it!

21:30.290 --> 21:32.876
- There are these bears,
uh, Gobi bears.

21:32.917 --> 21:34.878
Um, I'm gonna sign up with
an organization

21:34.919 --> 21:37.255
that's working to help
save them from extinction.

21:37.297 --> 21:40.675
I'm not too sure exactly
how long it'll be--

21:40.717 --> 21:42.510
- Probably just a few months.

21:42.552 --> 21:44.095
- This is amazing!

21:44.137 --> 21:46.097
- It is, except for the fact
that these bears

21:46.139 --> 21:48.016
are being slaughtered for sport

21:48.058 --> 21:49.059
and there'll be none
of them left

21:49.100 --> 21:51.102
if something isn't done
about it.

21:51.144 --> 21:53.355
So Bob and I,
we can do something.

21:54.564 --> 21:56.274
We can make a difference.

21:56.316 --> 21:57.817
And it's not just about
the bears, actually.

21:57.859 --> 21:59.861
Their nomadic culture
is also under threat,

21:59.903 --> 22:03.948
so we'd be dealing with herd
health and breeding techniques.

22:03.990 --> 22:06.951
So not only would we be helping
a nearly extinct animal,

22:06.993 --> 22:09.329
but potentially saving
people's livelihoods.

22:10.288 --> 22:12.540
- I'm so proud of you!
- So am I.

22:13.792 --> 22:15.377
- (Clapping)

22:25.011 --> 22:28.348
- Gobi bears? Mongolia?

22:30.642 --> 22:32.686
Have you completely lost
your mind?

22:32.727 --> 22:33.770
- Dad, just listen.

22:33.812 --> 22:37.023
- No. I don't wanna hear
anymore about this!

22:37.065 --> 22:39.984
What kind of a husband
leaves his pregnant wife

22:40.026 --> 22:43.279
to run off to some insanely
remote country

22:43.321 --> 22:47.659
on an idealistic fantasy
to "save the Gobi bears"?

22:47.701 --> 22:48.785
Give me a break!

22:48.827 --> 22:51.162
- They're in danger!
He's going to save them!

22:51.204 --> 22:53.915
- Ty should concentrate on what
he needs to do around here!

22:53.957 --> 22:55.166
Wake up, you two!

22:55.208 --> 22:57.252
You're having a child!

22:57.293 --> 22:59.629
That's something you should
take a whole lot more seriously

22:59.671 --> 23:02.590
than the plight of
the goddamn Gobi bear!

23:03.800 --> 23:06.177
(Irritated huff)
And, Amy,

23:06.219 --> 23:08.805
you are in no state, obviously,

23:08.847 --> 23:11.016
to make a rational decision!

23:11.057 --> 23:12.308
- What is that supposed
to mean?

23:12.350 --> 23:14.310
- I can't believe this!

23:14.352 --> 23:17.772
I mean, now I have two idiot
son-in-laws

23:17.814 --> 23:20.316
abandoning their wives
at the worst possible times.

23:20.358 --> 23:22.819
- Okay, everybody,
just calm down.

23:22.861 --> 23:25.572
- Okay, I'm not abandoning
anyone, all right?

23:25.613 --> 23:26.823
And you know what?

23:26.865 --> 23:28.533
I don't need to take
relationship advice from you!

23:28.575 --> 23:29.701
My marriage is strong.

23:29.743 --> 23:31.244
Amy and I have talked
about this.

23:31.286 --> 23:33.121
I love her and she loves me,
and we're gonna make it
through this.

23:33.163 --> 23:35.915
- Oh, please! I don't even know
why I talk to you,

23:35.957 --> 23:37.792
because you don't listen to me
anyway.

23:37.834 --> 23:39.878
This is the worst decision

23:41.921 --> 23:44.841
that you have ever made!

23:44.883 --> 23:46.843
I'd damn well re-think it
if I were you!

23:46.885 --> 23:48.887
- Tim... Tim!

23:48.928 --> 23:51.139
- Dad, this is not just Ty's
decision, okay?

23:51.181 --> 23:52.349
Th-- (Door opens)

23:52.390 --> 23:55.477
This is... this is our decision.
(Doors bang shut)

23:56.853 --> 23:58.772
(Crickets chirp)

24:03.151 --> 24:04.652
(Ty sighs)

24:05.904 --> 24:07.781
(Cody grunts restlessly)

24:11.284 --> 24:13.661
(Hooves clop restlessly)

24:15.205 --> 24:17.123
(Covers shift)

24:22.003 --> 24:24.339
(Approaching footsteps,
Cody huffs restlessly)

24:24.381 --> 24:27.801
- Hey, boy. How're you doing?

24:27.842 --> 24:31.596
(Light switch clicks on,
crickets chirp outside)

24:36.643 --> 24:38.603
Hey, Jack.

24:43.983 --> 24:45.735
Look, I um...

24:45.777 --> 24:48.988
I'm sure you have an opinion
about this decision.

24:50.865 --> 24:54.285
You were pretty quiet
at, uh, dinner there.

24:54.327 --> 24:55.704
I'd like to know your thoughts.

24:57.747 --> 24:59.749
- (Sighs heavily)

24:59.791 --> 25:01.793
(Crickets chirp outside)

25:01.835 --> 25:03.962
- I get it if you're not happy
about me leaving

25:04.004 --> 25:05.797
while Amy's pregnant.

25:05.839 --> 25:09.009
- That's part of it.
Not all of it.

25:10.802 --> 25:14.222
I can see that this whole thing
means an awful lot to you.

25:15.890 --> 25:20.353
It's obvious that you thought
about it long and hard.

25:20.395 --> 25:23.398
And I know you and Amy didn't
come to this decision lightly,

25:23.440 --> 25:25.859
'cause it wouldn't be like
you guys if you did.

25:27.360 --> 25:29.863
I also know that
you'll have regrets

25:31.114 --> 25:32.741
if you don't go on this...

25:33.867 --> 25:34.909
this mission.

25:37.328 --> 25:39.914
But you'll have regrets
if you do.

25:42.500 --> 25:43.626
You know, it makes me proud

25:43.668 --> 25:46.838
that you and Amy are able
to share this office.

25:48.131 --> 25:50.091
It's good to share things.

25:51.551 --> 25:54.346
I probably should've shared
a lot more with Lyndy.

25:54.387 --> 25:57.182
I was off on the rodeo circuit

25:57.223 --> 25:58.892
for months at a time.

26:01.144 --> 26:03.605
I left her on her own, Ty,

26:05.023 --> 26:06.775
when she was pregnant, so...

26:07.901 --> 26:10.070
You wanna talk about regrets?

26:13.823 --> 26:14.866
- But if I don't do this--

26:14.908 --> 26:16.910
- I know. You'll never do it.

26:18.161 --> 26:19.746
- It's not just that.

26:21.373 --> 26:23.625
I have never felt so...

26:24.918 --> 26:26.378
(Sighs)

26:26.419 --> 26:27.962
I don't know how to say it.
Um...

26:30.757 --> 26:33.259
I've never felt so compelled,

26:33.301 --> 26:35.303
so driven, about anything.

26:36.471 --> 26:38.306
About the bigger picture.

26:39.432 --> 26:41.643
About injustice.

26:44.354 --> 26:46.231
And maybe...

26:46.272 --> 26:49.484
I don't know -
maybe that's why...

26:49.526 --> 26:53.279
I don't want my child,
our child,

26:53.321 --> 26:56.366
to grow up in this
kind of world.

26:56.408 --> 26:57.951
I need to go there.

26:59.285 --> 27:01.788
I need to help do something
about it.

27:03.289 --> 27:04.833
- Okay.

27:06.459 --> 27:08.336
I get what you're saying,

27:11.381 --> 27:14.134
but the other part is this:

27:15.468 --> 27:16.845
for me,

27:18.430 --> 27:21.307
it's like having a son
go off to war,

27:23.309 --> 27:25.353
for all I know about Mongolia.

27:29.357 --> 27:31.109
- I promise I'll come back safe,
Jack,

27:31.151 --> 27:32.360
in one piece.

27:32.402 --> 27:34.362
- You can't promise that,

27:35.989 --> 27:38.867
and that's what's troubling me.

27:40.827 --> 27:41.953
You know, in the end,

27:41.995 --> 27:44.330
it's you and Amy that
have to figure this out.

27:44.372 --> 27:47.542
It's not up to me or Tim
or anyone else

27:47.584 --> 27:50.462
to tell you what you should
and shouldn't do.

27:50.503 --> 27:52.380
The decision's yours.

27:55.342 --> 27:57.677
Just make the right one.

28:04.267 --> 28:05.935
- Poor Ty.

28:05.977 --> 28:08.104
There was a complete family
meltdown last night.

28:08.146 --> 28:10.440
Tim really tore a strip off him.

28:10.482 --> 28:11.733
So just a heads up,

28:11.775 --> 28:14.027
our boss is gonna be in a
horrible mood this morning,

28:14.069 --> 28:17.238
so can we just lay low
with our ideas?

28:17.280 --> 28:19.616
- Um, no. I think we need
to tell Tim

28:19.657 --> 28:22.702
that we could give Maggie's
a much needed new image.

28:22.744 --> 28:25.038
- You don't even know
his current state of mind.

28:25.080 --> 28:27.248
We could be completely
overstepping our bounds.

28:27.290 --> 28:28.541
- Bounds. Shmounds.

28:28.583 --> 28:31.211
I've been posting and telling
all my friends on-line

28:31.252 --> 28:32.253
that they need to come
spend time

28:32.295 --> 28:34.172
at the new hip spot in town.

28:34.214 --> 28:37.217
And, this morning, I woke up
with a fabulous idea.

28:38.968 --> 28:40.970
- (Sighs heavily)

28:41.012 --> 28:43.264
(Footsteps thud, rooster crows,
Amy sighs)

28:43.306 --> 28:46.726
- Did you get any sleep
last night?

28:46.768 --> 28:50.188
- No. But I finally figured out
what's going on.

28:50.230 --> 28:52.399
I kept thinking that
I was missing something,

28:52.440 --> 28:56.111
so I enlarged the X-ray
and had another look.

28:56.152 --> 28:57.696
You see that right there?

28:57.737 --> 28:59.739
That's an abscess
in his back molar.

28:59.781 --> 29:01.366
Half the tooth has
just fallen away,

29:01.408 --> 29:03.410
leaving this really jagged edge.

29:03.451 --> 29:06.079
And that's what's caused
a massive laceration
in his tongue.

29:06.121 --> 29:08.415
- (Sighs)
- Both the abscess and the cut

29:08.456 --> 29:10.000
are so far back in his mouth

29:10.041 --> 29:11.835
that the initial X-ray
missed it.

29:11.876 --> 29:13.586
- Poor guy.

29:13.628 --> 29:17.048
Geez, he must be in an
incredible amount of pain.

29:17.090 --> 29:19.050
Probably why he can't swallow.

29:19.092 --> 29:22.053
- Or chew.
- So what're you gonna do?

29:22.095 --> 29:23.179
- Well, the abscessed tooth
is pretty loose,

29:23.221 --> 29:26.808
so I'm gonna remove it
and stitch up his tongue.

29:26.850 --> 29:27.934
- (Sighs)

29:27.976 --> 29:31.062
(Rock music plays,
diners chatter loudly)

29:31.104 --> 29:32.272
- Sorry.

29:36.192 --> 29:37.902
- Word gets around fast, huh?

29:37.944 --> 29:39.320
(Loud chatter)

29:39.362 --> 29:40.572
Isn't it awesome?
(Door opens)

29:40.613 --> 29:42.490
- Huh.

29:42.532 --> 29:45.201
Man: Aw, forget it, too noisy!

29:45.243 --> 29:48.079
(Music blares)

29:54.336 --> 29:55.545
(Tim sighs heavily)

29:55.587 --> 29:56.796
(Rock music plays,
diners chatter loudly)

29:58.590 --> 30:01.718
- You're supposed to be working
with me, not against me.

30:01.760 --> 30:02.761
- I don't get why
you're so upset.

30:02.802 --> 30:05.180
The diner has never been
a more fun place to be.

30:05.221 --> 30:07.265
- My friends love hanging
out here now.

30:07.307 --> 30:09.726
- Oh yeah! Sure they love
hanging out here!

30:09.768 --> 30:12.395
What's not to love? They can
sit around and talk for hours

30:12.437 --> 30:15.440
over a plate of fries
and endless soda refills.

30:15.482 --> 30:17.442
And free wifi?!

30:17.484 --> 30:20.570
Come on, it costs them
next to nothing to be here.

30:20.612 --> 30:22.197
It's costing me everything!

30:23.490 --> 30:25.116
I want this place
back to normal...

30:25.158 --> 30:27.202
(Jar clunks) Now!

30:28.328 --> 30:30.121
- That's that.

30:30.163 --> 30:31.373
- No it's not. (Sighs)

30:31.414 --> 30:34.084
We need to show Tim how
successful our ideas can be.

30:34.125 --> 30:36.586
- We should just quit
while we still have jobs.

30:36.628 --> 30:39.506
(Rock music plays,
diners chatter loudly)

30:41.257 --> 30:43.802
(Bird chirps,
Stethoscope clunks)

30:43.843 --> 30:45.637
- So how did it go?
(Gloves snap)

30:45.679 --> 30:47.055
- Good.

30:47.097 --> 30:49.057
It's gonna take some time
for the sedation to wear off,

30:49.099 --> 30:50.809
but it went really well.

30:50.850 --> 30:55.021
I removed the abscessed tooth
and stitched up his tongue.

30:55.063 --> 30:57.023
- I'm so glad you found it.

30:57.065 --> 30:58.066
- Yeah, it was easy to miss.

30:58.108 --> 31:00.068
I'm sorry we didn't find it
sooner, Casey.

31:00.110 --> 31:02.278
- So when can I take him home?

31:02.320 --> 31:03.863
- Uh, I'd say give him
'til tomorrow.

31:03.905 --> 31:07.200
Um, I wanna make sure
everything starts to heal
the way it should.

31:07.242 --> 31:09.536
- Oh... You're gonna be...

31:09.577 --> 31:12.622
back to your old self
in no time, aren't ya?

31:12.664 --> 31:15.000
So just... call me anytime.

31:15.041 --> 31:16.626
- We will.

31:16.668 --> 31:18.586
- And... don't let Tim
get you down.

31:18.628 --> 31:21.172
I mean... we all know him.

31:21.214 --> 31:22.632
He gets super stressed out
about things

31:22.674 --> 31:25.176
and then he sees reason...
usually.

31:26.302 --> 31:28.013
So don't give up.

31:28.054 --> 31:29.639
- Thanks, Casey.

31:29.681 --> 31:31.558
- See ya.
- Bye.

31:35.353 --> 31:36.813
Gavin: It's great that you guys
got in touch.

31:36.855 --> 31:38.523
This is a program that depends
completely

31:38.565 --> 31:40.608
on that kind of passion.

31:40.650 --> 31:42.610
Everyone involved
from the assistants,

31:42.652 --> 31:44.654
to the interpreters,
to the vets

31:44.696 --> 31:46.364
donate their time and skills.
- Mm-hmm.

31:46.406 --> 31:47.699
- It's the only way
we can exist.

31:47.741 --> 31:50.160
- I... And I totally respect
that.

31:50.201 --> 31:53.163
I do have to say though
that, um,

31:53.204 --> 31:54.581
Amy and I, we're expecting
a baby, so...

31:54.622 --> 31:56.833
- Oh wow! Congratulations!
- Thanks.

31:56.875 --> 31:59.377
- Thank you.
It begs the question,

31:59.419 --> 32:02.130
if Amy were to need me, or if
there were any complications...

32:02.172 --> 32:04.424
- There won't be.

32:04.466 --> 32:06.384
- But if there were...
- You'll be on the next
flight home.

32:06.426 --> 32:07.677
I promise you.

32:07.719 --> 32:09.387
Bob: Well, sounds fair,
right, man?

32:09.429 --> 32:10.472
(Birds chirp)

32:12.307 --> 32:15.810
- Yeah, it does.
- Well, come on, let's sign up!

32:15.852 --> 32:17.729
- There's one more thing
I gotta do

32:17.771 --> 32:19.481
and then I'll get right
back to you.

32:19.522 --> 32:22.192
(Clipboard clunks)
- Mongolia.

32:22.233 --> 32:24.277
Wow!
(Cat meows)

32:24.319 --> 32:25.862
- Yeah. Look, Scott.

32:25.904 --> 32:28.365
This is something that
I really wanna do,

32:28.406 --> 32:31.201
It'll only be for a few months,

32:31.242 --> 32:33.161
and I fully intend to come back

32:33.203 --> 32:34.829
and take my position
at the clinic,

32:34.871 --> 32:37.499
if you agree, of course.

32:37.540 --> 32:39.209
- I understand.

32:39.250 --> 32:42.629
This is a passion project
for you.

32:42.671 --> 32:45.048
And I'm sorry I-I never got to
do something like this myself.

32:45.090 --> 32:46.299
I...

32:47.550 --> 32:49.135
I don't know what to say.

32:50.929 --> 32:53.807
Are you okay with all of this?
I mean...

32:53.848 --> 32:56.017
- Yeah. This is the one time

32:56.059 --> 32:58.687
that Ty's gonna be able
to do something like this.

32:58.728 --> 33:00.021
I'm fine with it.

33:03.316 --> 33:05.443
- Okay.

33:05.485 --> 33:08.488
I'm probably gonna regret this,

33:08.530 --> 33:10.198
but I think the benefits
from this trip

33:10.240 --> 33:12.575
will make you a better vet.

33:12.617 --> 33:15.370
So... your job
and your partnership

33:15.412 --> 33:17.622
will be here waiting for you
when you get back.

33:19.457 --> 33:20.583
(Hands clap)

33:20.625 --> 33:23.128
- Thanks, Scott.
- Of course.

33:23.169 --> 33:24.337
(Truck rumbles)

33:24.379 --> 33:26.506
Ty: I'm still worried
about your dad and Jack.

33:26.548 --> 33:28.466
Amy: I think we have to ignore
all the outside noise

33:28.508 --> 33:29.592
from my family.

33:29.634 --> 33:31.177
(Truck accelerates)

33:31.219 --> 33:33.430
Ty, stop the truck.

33:33.471 --> 33:35.223
- Okay, hold on. Just a sec.

33:36.433 --> 33:39.227
(Truck rumbles to a halt)

33:40.603 --> 33:42.522
(Doors open)

33:45.775 --> 33:47.444
(Door bangs shut)

33:47.485 --> 33:49.279
(Gravel crunches underfoot)

33:49.320 --> 33:51.823
- Here.
- I don't need it.

33:51.865 --> 33:53.742
I'm not the least bit nauseous.

33:55.452 --> 33:57.078
(Kissing)

33:59.956 --> 34:02.542
I just wanted to kiss you

34:02.584 --> 34:04.753
and I couldn't do that
while we were in the truck

34:04.794 --> 34:07.047
in case you drove off the road.
(Chuckling)

34:07.088 --> 34:10.592
We both know that we have
precious cargo on board.

34:10.632 --> 34:12.092
Ty, I am so proud of you.

34:13.344 --> 34:15.764
You're gonna do an amazing job.

34:17.556 --> 34:20.435
(Kissing)

34:23.980 --> 34:26.524
- So it's only for a few months.

34:26.565 --> 34:27.942
- Bob and I are exactly
the type of guys

34:27.984 --> 34:30.445
that they need right now.

34:30.487 --> 34:32.697
And I believe that if no one
steps up to these situations
that--

34:32.739 --> 34:35.909
Tim: The world as we know it
will fall apart.

34:35.949 --> 34:38.078
- This is a great opportunity
to do something.

34:38.119 --> 34:40.371
- Dad, if he doesn't do this,
he'll regret it,

34:40.413 --> 34:42.748
just like Casey does.

34:42.791 --> 34:44.458
- What? What about Casey?

34:45.710 --> 34:47.379
- She never told you?

34:47.420 --> 34:49.005
She gave up her rodeo career.

34:49.047 --> 34:51.757
She used to be one of the top
barrel racers in the country.

34:51.800 --> 34:54.719
- She quit
'cause she got tired of it.

34:54.761 --> 34:57.263
- No. I think you should
probably ask her

34:57.305 --> 34:58.848
why she gave it up.

34:58.890 --> 35:01.476
She still wishes she hadn't.

35:01.518 --> 35:04.104
And I'm not gonna be the one
to stand in Ty's way.

35:05.480 --> 35:07.607
Grandpa, you should understand
that.

35:07.649 --> 35:09.567
Grandma Lyndy wasn't one
to bubble wrap herself.

35:09.609 --> 35:10.944
I mean,

35:10.985 --> 35:12.612
she enjoyed her freedom
when you were on the circuit.

35:12.654 --> 35:14.030
- That is not true.

35:14.072 --> 35:16.741
She was miserable
when I was away.

35:16.783 --> 35:19.035
- Yeah, so miserable
that she toured

35:19.077 --> 35:22.080
and wrote songs
and recorded them?

35:22.122 --> 35:24.624
- Yes, okay, she did do that.

35:24.666 --> 35:26.459
- (Chuckles)

35:26.501 --> 35:29.671
- Well, it's funny that you say
that because...

35:29.713 --> 35:32.882
Lyndy wrote a song when she
was pregnant with your mom

35:32.924 --> 35:35.510
and it was such
a beautiful song.

35:35.552 --> 35:37.887
I wanted to give it to you,
but I couldn't find it.

35:37.929 --> 35:40.765
- I know exactly where it is.

35:42.100 --> 35:44.519
(Chuckles) This one?

35:46.229 --> 35:50.150
You used to play this for me
all the time when I was a kid.

35:50.191 --> 35:52.068
- Yeah, see, there it is.
"When to Let Go."

35:52.110 --> 35:53.528
Th-that's the song.

35:53.570 --> 35:54.779
- (Chuckles)

35:54.821 --> 35:57.782
- Yeah, one of the prettiest
songs she ever wrote.

35:57.824 --> 36:00.702
- Except she wasn't exactly
sitting around,

36:00.744 --> 36:03.121
waiting for you to come home
from the circuit.

36:03.163 --> 36:05.415
She was probably happy
to have her freedom.

36:05.457 --> 36:07.834
- (Chuckling) Yeah,
you're probably right.

36:07.876 --> 36:10.962
I was a pain in the butt
when I wasn't on the road.

36:11.004 --> 36:12.881
- I really want Ty to do this.

36:14.632 --> 36:16.926
- I know you two will look
after her while I'm gone.

36:16.968 --> 36:18.887
(Cell phone buzzes)

36:22.640 --> 36:24.559
- What's this about?

36:26.978 --> 36:28.605
Open Mic Night tonight,

36:28.646 --> 36:30.565
at Maggie's.

36:30.607 --> 36:32.609
I'm gonna kill those kids.

36:32.650 --> 36:35.737
Singer: * Already had
complete control *

36:36.905 --> 36:39.657
* But you were something of... *

36:39.699 --> 36:43.161
- When this is done,
you can both go look for jobs.

36:43.203 --> 36:45.789
- (Sighs) Come on, Tim,
this is a good idea.

36:45.830 --> 36:47.916
- And it's not just kids
drinking refills of soda.

36:47.957 --> 36:49.125
We've built on the clientele.

36:49.167 --> 36:50.794
Look, even all the oldies
are back.

36:50.835 --> 36:52.754
- And look how much money
we're making.

36:52.796 --> 36:54.464
- Don't be such a stick
in the mud.

36:54.506 --> 36:56.675
Admit it, this is a lot of fun.
(Coins clink)

36:56.716 --> 37:00.929
Singer: * Took a whole lot of
rolling back up that hill *

37:00.970 --> 37:03.932
* To find you a way
back to me *

37:03.973 --> 37:06.434
- Okay, I'll make you a deal.

37:06.476 --> 37:09.270
I want this place operating
as usual,

37:10.605 --> 37:13.525
and then you can run
your little open mic thing...

37:13.566 --> 37:15.026
on the weekends,
every other week.

37:15.068 --> 37:17.112
- Every week.
- Don't push it.

37:17.153 --> 37:18.905
(Singer strums last chords)

37:18.947 --> 37:21.950
(Patrons clap and cheer)
- Thank you, thank you.

37:21.991 --> 37:23.952
- Amy, you should go sing.

37:23.993 --> 37:25.120
- Yeah, do it!

37:25.161 --> 37:26.663
Georgie: Come on!

37:26.705 --> 37:29.916
- Okay. Only if Grandpa
comes with me.

37:29.958 --> 37:32.377
- Excuse me, do you think
I could borrow your guitar?

37:32.419 --> 37:34.671
- Sure.
- Thank you.

37:34.713 --> 37:37.716
Man: Oh, here we go!
Man 2: All right, Amy!

37:37.757 --> 37:38.967
(Patrons chatter)
Singer: Thank you.

37:39.009 --> 37:40.844
- Okay.

37:40.885 --> 37:44.556
This is a song that
my Grandma Lyndy wrote

37:44.597 --> 37:46.182
when she was pregnant
with my mom.

37:46.224 --> 37:48.768
Patrons: Aww...
- It's called "When to Let Go".

37:48.810 --> 37:50.979
(Jack plays guitar)

37:52.647 --> 37:55.483
Amy: * Seasons turn,
winter's gone *

37:57.777 --> 37:59.654
* The rain can finally fall *

38:00.864 --> 38:02.657
* Springtime's got it all *

38:04.743 --> 38:06.953
* It brings a new song
everyday *

38:09.998 --> 38:12.959
* The cow jumped over the moon *

38:13.001 --> 38:15.670
* but I have the sliver spoon *

38:15.712 --> 38:18.006
* I dream of holding you
one day *

38:21.801 --> 38:25.472
* But I can hear
my mama say... *

38:28.266 --> 38:30.810
Jack and Amy: * Love that child
with all of your soul *

38:30.852 --> 38:34.105
* But there's one hard thing
that you need to know *

38:34.147 --> 38:36.608
* If you really want
your love to show *

38:36.649 --> 38:39.235
* Know when to hold on *

38:39.277 --> 38:41.905
* And when to let go *

38:41.946 --> 38:44.074
(Guitar plays)

38:44.115 --> 38:51.539
**

38:51.581 --> 38:51.873
(Jack strums final chord)

38:57.962 --> 39:00.256
- So remember, soft foods
for the next two weeks

39:00.298 --> 39:03.009
and keep him on those anti
inflammatories as well.

39:03.051 --> 39:04.636
- He's gonna be just fine.
(Truck rumbles to a stop)

39:04.678 --> 39:06.012
- I can't think you guys enough.

39:06.054 --> 39:08.098
(Door bangs shut)
- Hey!

39:08.139 --> 39:10.183
- Okay, your son-in-law
is amazing!

39:10.225 --> 39:12.143
He found something that
my vet totally missed.

39:12.185 --> 39:13.728
And if it hadn't been for him,

39:13.770 --> 39:15.021
my beautiful boy wouldn't
have stood a chance.

39:15.063 --> 39:18.024
- Yeah, yeah, he really knows
what he's doing. Usually.

39:18.066 --> 39:19.567
(Receding footsteps)

39:22.320 --> 39:23.905
- I hear you miss barrel racing.

39:25.240 --> 39:27.659
- (Taken aback, laughs)
It's nothing.

39:28.993 --> 39:31.121
- Take it up again.
- No... I'm out of practice.

39:31.162 --> 39:32.831
- It's never too late.
- I'm too old for that.

39:32.872 --> 39:35.208
- No you're not.

39:35.250 --> 39:38.003
You can do it. Just try it.

39:39.713 --> 39:41.589
I promise I won't stand
in your way.

39:43.049 --> 39:44.926
- I'm glad you said that.

39:47.595 --> 39:49.514
(Kissing)

39:55.228 --> 39:56.938
(Elk grunts)
Bob: So I checked up on our guy
this morning.

39:56.980 --> 39:59.107
He's totally ready to go.
He wants to go!

39:59.149 --> 40:01.443
- Let's do it!
- Right on!

40:01.484 --> 40:04.320
Hey, wrapping up loose ends,
before the big trek, right?

40:04.362 --> 40:06.156
- You know it, man!
(Fists thud, Giddy laughter)

40:06.197 --> 40:07.824
- How old are you guys?

40:07.866 --> 40:10.452
(Pen door latch clicks)

40:10.493 --> 40:13.913
Bob: My friend, you ready
to taste some freedom?

40:13.955 --> 40:15.165
(Clucks his tongue)
Ty: Come on, buddy.

40:15.206 --> 40:16.666
Bob: (Clucks tongue)
(Elk grunts)

40:16.708 --> 40:19.044
Ty: There you go!
Bob: (Whistling)

40:19.085 --> 40:21.921
(Grass crunches under hooves)

40:23.006 --> 40:24.049
- Thanks.

40:28.595 --> 40:29.721
(Grass crunches under hooves)

40:31.264 --> 40:32.891
(Birds chirp)

40:36.936 --> 40:38.855
(Door clinks)

40:38.897 --> 40:39.898
(Light kiss)

40:41.399 --> 40:44.486
(Birds chirp, Amy sighs)

40:47.947 --> 40:49.074
(Bird chirps)

40:50.742 --> 40:53.745
(Case rattles,
trunk bangs shut)

40:53.787 --> 40:55.747
- Promise me you'll do a blog
with lots of photos!

40:55.789 --> 40:59.000
I wanna know everything
you're doing. Every detail!

40:59.042 --> 41:00.335
If there's a chance for me
to come and help out

41:00.377 --> 41:02.879
I'll-I'll quit school
immediately.

41:02.921 --> 41:04.714
- Well, thanks, Georgie, but...

41:04.756 --> 41:06.883
I think Amy needs you here more.

41:06.925 --> 41:08.301
- I'll miss you.

41:08.343 --> 41:10.011
- I'm gonna miss you too.
Come here.

41:11.638 --> 41:13.181
- Bye.

41:13.223 --> 41:15.850
- You know, I could've driven
you to the airport.

41:15.892 --> 41:17.894
(Hands clap)
- I know, Jack, but...

41:17.936 --> 41:19.688
I kinda wanted to say
my goodbyes here.

41:19.729 --> 41:21.398
- Yeah, I get that.

41:21.439 --> 41:22.857
So uh... you be safe.

41:24.317 --> 41:25.944
- I will.

41:27.278 --> 41:30.490
- Okay. (Hard pats)

41:32.325 --> 41:34.202
- Thanks for understanding, Tim.

41:34.244 --> 41:36.121
- I don't.

41:36.162 --> 41:39.124
Just... take care of yourself,
huh?

41:39.165 --> 41:41.251
Amy needs you.

41:41.292 --> 41:42.794
We need you. (Light pat)

41:46.131 --> 41:48.216
- You call me as soon as
you get on the plane.

41:48.258 --> 41:49.759
- I will.

41:49.801 --> 41:51.428
- And when you get to Beijing.

41:51.469 --> 41:53.805
- Absolutely. And I promise,

41:53.847 --> 41:56.266
I'll be back at a moments
notice, if anything happens.

41:56.307 --> 41:58.518
- We'll be fine.

42:01.104 --> 42:02.731
- Take care of the nugget, okay?

42:02.772 --> 42:04.441
- I will.

42:04.482 --> 42:06.901
- I love you.
- I love you too.

42:06.943 --> 42:10.822
* Generations one-by-one *
(Kissing)

42:12.824 --> 42:14.909
* I will sing you *

42:16.828 --> 42:17.954
* Home... *

42:17.996 --> 42:25.253
**

42:25.295 --> 42:26.921
(Ty sighs)

42:28.548 --> 42:31.760
(Door opens, engine starts,
door bangs shut)

42:32.844 --> 42:35.764
(Taxi rumbles away)

42:37.098 --> 42:39.559
* This is my prayer for you *

42:41.436 --> 42:44.022
* Maybe someday I will know *

42:47.400 --> 42:50.612
* If it helped
your journey home *

42:52.238 --> 42:55.575
* Or if it helped me
let you go *

42:59.204 --> 43:01.956
* I'll sing for you
because I need to *

43:02.874 --> 43:04.959
* Right now this is all I know *

43:06.461 --> 43:10.298
* You always said
you wanted me to *

43:12.342 --> 43:14.135
* So I will sing you home *

43:16.471 --> 43:18.056
* I will sing you home *

43:20.433 --> 43:22.811
* I will sing you home *

43:26.439 --> 43:29.150
* I will sing you *

43:30.443 --> 43:33.988
* Home... *
