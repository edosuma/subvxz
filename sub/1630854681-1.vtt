I mean, why did you bring me all
the way down here, Detective?

36:40.612 --> 36:43.373
Well, I was hoping
that you could help us identify

36:43.408 --> 36:45.617
the intruder
who broke into your penthouse.

36:46.480 --> 36:51.692
Um, does this man
look familiar to you?

36:55.074 --> 36:57.801
No. No.

36:59.631 --> 37:01.426
Okay.

37:01.460 --> 37:05.809
Um, why exactly do you
have that penthouse, Dr. Logan?

37:06.707 --> 37:07.846
Excuse me?

37:07.880 --> 37:10.711
Well, a man that you don't know

37:10.745 --> 37:13.817
breaks into your penthouse
and ends up dead.

37:15.716 --> 37:18.684
It's just unusual.
