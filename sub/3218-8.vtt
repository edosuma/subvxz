00:13.671 --> 00:17.585
- Merry Christmas, Grandpa.
- Oh, Merry Christmas to you, Stevey.

00:18.968 --> 00:20.427
Did you bring me any presents?

00:20.595 --> 00:22.089
Now, why would I wanna do that?

00:22.263 --> 00:23.508
Because it's Christmas.

00:23.681 --> 00:27.809
Oh. I thought Santa Claus
brought the presents at Christmas.

00:27.977 --> 00:30.016
You have been a good boy this year?

00:30.187 --> 00:31.350
I have, I swear.

00:31.522 --> 00:34.013
Well, then. Who knows?
Maybe he'll come.

01:10.062 --> 01:11.556
Santa.

01:20.364 --> 01:21.822
Reindeer.

02:07.870 --> 02:09.032
Santa?

02:26.973 --> 02:29.131
My daughter and I were in our beds.

02:30.018 --> 02:32.094
Mike was downstairs
decorating the tree.

02:32.604 --> 02:36.732
And I heard a thump on the roof
and then I heard Mike scream...

02:37.483 --> 02:39.690
...and now I'm talking to the FBI.

02:39.861 --> 02:41.189
You didn't see any of it?

02:41.362 --> 02:43.271
No, he was...

02:43.448 --> 02:44.562
He was just gone.

02:45.033 --> 02:47.654
- The doors were locked, no forced entry?
- That's right.

02:47.827 --> 02:49.985
- Does anybody else have a key?
- My parents.

02:50.163 --> 02:52.286
- Where do they live?
- Florida.

02:52.457 --> 02:54.284
Thanks for letting me have a look.

02:54.459 --> 02:56.997
I think we got just about
everything we need.

02:57.503 --> 02:59.046
We're all set.

02:59.213 --> 03:00.293
We'll be in touch.

03:05.219 --> 03:06.927
Agents.

03:07.555 --> 03:10.011
The police said my husband
might've been kidnapped.

03:10.725 --> 03:12.100
Could be.

03:12.268 --> 03:14.142
Then why haven't
the kidnappers called?

03:14.312 --> 03:16.389
Or demanded a ransom?

03:16.565 --> 03:18.973
It's three days until Christmas.

03:19.151 --> 03:21.191
What am I supposed to tell
our daughter?

03:21.737 --> 03:23.148
We're very sorry.

03:31.872 --> 03:32.903
Find anything?

03:33.082 --> 03:36.415
Stockings, mistletoe, this.

03:36.585 --> 03:37.914
A tooth? Where was this?

03:38.087 --> 03:40.838
In the chimney.
- No way a man fits up a chimney...

03:41.006 --> 03:43.497
...it's too narrow.
- No way he fits up in one piece.

03:43.676 --> 03:45.336
So if dad went up the chimney...

03:45.511 --> 03:48.084
We need to find out
what dragged him up there.

03:56.230 --> 03:57.605
So was I right?

03:58.107 --> 04:00.348
Is it the serial killing chimney sweep?

04:00.526 --> 04:03.942
Yup, it's actually Dick Van Dyke.

04:04.446 --> 04:05.905
<i>- Who?
- Mary Poppins...</i>

04:06.073 --> 04:08.066
- Who's that?
- Oh, come on... Engh. Never mind.

04:08.993 --> 04:11.947
Walsh is the second guy
grabbed out of his house this month.

04:12.121 --> 04:13.152
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

04:13.330 --> 04:15.122
Did he get dragged up
the chimney too?

04:15.290 --> 04:18.410
Don't know. Witnesses said they heard
a thump on the roof.

04:18.961 --> 04:20.206
What are we dealing with?

04:20.379 --> 04:22.502
- Actually, I have an idea.
- Yeah?

04:22.673 --> 04:24.215
It's gonna sound crazy.

04:24.383 --> 04:27.337
What could you possibly say
that sounds crazy to me?

04:27.553 --> 04:30.470
Um... Evil Santa.

04:31.932 --> 04:33.973
- Yeah, that's crazy.
- Yeah.

04:34.144 --> 04:38.806
I'm just saying that there's some version
of the Anti-Claus in every culture.

04:38.982 --> 04:41.520
You got Belsnickel,
Krampus, Black Peter.

04:41.693 --> 04:44.314
- Whatever you wanna call it.
- Saying what?

04:44.487 --> 04:46.978
Saying, back in the day,
Santa's brother went rogue.

04:47.157 --> 04:50.573
Now he shows up around Christmas,
but instead he punishes the wicked.

04:50.744 --> 04:53.495
- By hauling their ass up chimneys?
- For starters, yeah.

04:53.663 --> 04:56.450
So this is your theory, huh?
Santa's shady brother?

04:56.624 --> 04:59.412
Well, I... Just saying,
that's what the lore says.

04:59.586 --> 05:01.875
Santa doesn't have a brother.
There is no Santa.

05:02.047 --> 05:05.665
Yeah, I know. You're the one who told
me that in the first place, remember?

05:10.972 --> 05:13.380
Yeah, you know what,
I could be wrong, I...

05:14.809 --> 05:15.972
Gotta be wrong.

05:16.144 --> 05:17.887
Maybe, maybe not.

05:18.063 --> 05:20.554
- What?
- I did a little digging.

05:20.732 --> 05:22.559
Both victims visited the same place...

05:22.734 --> 05:24.810
...before they got snatched.
- Where?

05:30.241 --> 05:32.649
Hurry up. Ha-ha.

05:32.827 --> 05:34.571
Hurry.

05:36.039 --> 05:37.581
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:37.749 --> 05:39.955
It does kind of lend credence
to the theory.

05:40.126 --> 05:43.495
Yeah, but Anti-Claus? Couldn't be.

05:43.671 --> 05:47.716
It's a Christmas miracle. Speaking of,
we should have one this year.

05:48.259 --> 05:49.919
- Have one what?
- A Christmas.

05:50.095 --> 05:52.634
- Ha. No, thanks.
- No, we'll get a tree...

05:52.807 --> 05:55.724
...a little Boston Market,
just like when we were little.

05:55.893 --> 05:58.384
Dean, those weren't exactly
Hallmark memories for me.

05:58.896 --> 06:00.604
We had some great Christmases.

06:00.773 --> 06:03.346
- Who's childhood are you talking about?
- Come on, Sam.

06:03.526 --> 06:05.435
No, just...

06:05.695 --> 06:06.774
No.

06:08.531 --> 06:10.523
All right, grinch.

06:29.593 --> 06:31.171
What is that?

06:32.138 --> 06:33.217
Present for dad.

06:33.973 --> 06:37.009
Yeah, right. Where did you
get the money? Steal it?

06:37.184 --> 06:39.806
No. Uncle Bobby gave it to me
to give to him.

06:39.979 --> 06:41.390
Said it was real special.

06:41.564 --> 06:42.643
What is it?

06:43.274 --> 06:44.982
- A pony.
- Heh.

06:45.317 --> 06:47.144
Very funny.

06:51.615 --> 06:52.991
Dad's gonna be here, right?

06:53.659 --> 06:56.150
- He'll be here.
- But it's Christmas.

06:56.662 --> 06:57.693
He knows.

06:57.872 --> 06:59.698
And he'll be here. Promise.

06:59.874 --> 07:02.329
- Where is he anyway?
- On business.

07:02.501 --> 07:05.123
- What kind of business?
- You know that.

07:05.880 --> 07:07.873
- He sells stuff.
- What kind of stuff?

07:08.050 --> 07:09.295
Stuff.

07:09.468 --> 07:11.092
Nobody ever tells me anything.

07:12.304 --> 07:14.427
Then quit asking.

07:22.439 --> 07:23.602
Is dad a spy?

07:23.857 --> 07:27.522
- Mm-hm. He's James Bond.
- Why do we move around so much?

07:27.694 --> 07:31.229
Because everywhere we go,
they get sick of your face.

07:34.117 --> 07:36.573
I'm old enough, Dean.
You can tell me the truth.

07:36.745 --> 07:39.995
You don't wanna know the truth.
Believe me.

07:40.165 --> 07:42.917
Is that why we never talk about mom?

07:43.418 --> 07:47.083
Shut up!
Don't you ever talk about mom, ever!

07:50.550 --> 07:52.342
Wait, where are you going?

07:52.511 --> 07:54.135
Out.

08:03.313 --> 08:05.685
You'd think for the 10 bucks
it costs to get in...

08:05.857 --> 08:08.064
...Santa could scrounge up
a little snow.

08:10.153 --> 08:11.529
What?

08:11.905 --> 08:14.574
Nothing.
What are we looking for again?

08:15.659 --> 08:17.367
Um...

08:17.911 --> 08:21.362
Lore says that the Anti-Claus
will walk with a limp...

08:21.540 --> 08:23.947
...and smell like sweets.

08:24.292 --> 08:27.959
Great, so we're looking for
a pimp Santa. Why the sweets?

08:28.131 --> 08:32.128
Think about it. If you smell like candy,
the kids will come closer, you know?

08:33.260 --> 08:35.134
- That's creepy.
- Heh.

08:35.346 --> 08:38.513
How does this thing know who's been
naughty and who's been nice?

08:39.225 --> 08:40.423
I don't know.

08:42.645 --> 08:45.599
So, Ronny, come sit on Santa's knee.
Augh.

08:45.773 --> 08:47.102
There you go.

08:47.275 --> 08:49.647
- You've been a good boy this year?
Yeah.

08:49.819 --> 08:51.194
Good.

08:51.362 --> 08:53.983
Santa's got a special gift for you.

08:56.909 --> 08:57.941
Maybe we do.

08:59.120 --> 09:00.151
Come on, honey.

09:00.329 --> 09:01.610
- All right.
- Let's go.

09:02.248 --> 09:05.165
Welcome to Santa's Court.
Can I escort your child to Santa?

09:05.835 --> 09:07.163
No, no.

09:07.336 --> 09:10.752
But actually, my brother here,
it's been a lifelong dream of his.

09:12.383 --> 09:16.251
- Sorry. No kids over 12.
- No, he's just kidding.

09:16.429 --> 09:17.923
We only came here to watch.

09:21.517 --> 09:23.011
Ew.

09:24.061 --> 09:26.220
I didn't mean that we came here to... Y...

09:28.191 --> 09:29.815
Thanks a lot, Dean. Thanks for that.

09:31.903 --> 09:33.563
Check it out.

09:38.618 --> 09:40.527
It's all right.

09:43.957 --> 09:45.286
Are you seeing this?

09:45.834 --> 09:47.376
A lot of people walk with limps.

09:47.544 --> 09:52.420
- You didn't smell that? That was candy.
- That was ripple. I think. Had to be.

09:54.718 --> 09:56.675
Maybe.
We willing to take that chance?

10:00.682 --> 10:02.509
What time is it?

10:02.684 --> 10:04.843
Same as the last time you asked.

10:05.813 --> 10:07.473
Here.

10:07.648 --> 10:09.190
Caffeinate.

10:17.282 --> 10:18.480
Wonderful.

10:22.454 --> 10:24.246
Hey, Sam.

10:24.873 --> 10:25.952
Yeah?

10:26.458 --> 10:28.498
Why are you the boy
that hates Christmas?

10:29.545 --> 10:31.039
- Dean.
- I mean, I admit it.

10:31.213 --> 10:33.371
We had a few bumpy holidays
when we were kids.

10:33.549 --> 10:35.043
- Bumpy?
- But that was then.

10:35.217 --> 10:36.592
We'll do it right this year.

10:37.469 --> 10:40.387
Look, Dean, if you wanna
have Christmas, knock yourself out.

10:40.556 --> 10:42.216
Just don't involve me.

10:44.768 --> 10:48.102
Oh, yeah. That would be great.
Me and myself making cranberry molds.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.323
What's up with Saint Nicotine?

11:06.833 --> 11:08.208
Oh, my God!

11:15.884 --> 11:17.342
Ha.

11:17.552 --> 11:19.212
- What?
- Nothing.

11:19.387 --> 11:20.550
It's just that...

11:20.722 --> 11:24.850
Well, you know, Mr. Gung-Ho Christmas
might have to blow away Santa.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.315
The hell you doing here, huh?

11:34.611 --> 11:36.650
<i>I'm really not interested, okay?</i>

11:36.821 --> 11:38.196
<i>Mistle my toe.</i>

11:38.823 --> 11:39.902
<i>Roast my chestnut.</i>

11:40.492 --> 11:42.069
L...

11:43.453 --> 11:44.698
<i>Jingle my bell.</i>

12:05.225 --> 12:07.098
Let's go.

12:35.881 --> 12:38.004
Santa, you're early.

14:14.481 --> 14:16.936
So that's how your son
described the attack?

14:17.108 --> 14:18.852
Santa took daddy up the chimney?

14:19.027 --> 14:20.901
That's what he says, yes.

14:21.071 --> 14:23.110
- And where were you?
- I was asleep.

14:23.740 --> 14:29.079
And all of a sudden, Al was being
dragged out of bed, screaming.

14:29.246 --> 14:30.740
Did you see the attacker?

14:32.374 --> 14:34.781
It was dark and he hit me.

14:34.960 --> 14:36.039
He knocked me out.

14:37.128 --> 14:38.623
I'm sorry. I know this is hard.

14:39.130 --> 14:40.375
Yeah. Uh...

14:41.258 --> 14:45.302
Mrs. Caldwell, where did you get
that wreath above the fireplace?

14:51.351 --> 14:52.596
Excuse me?

14:56.983 --> 14:59.189
Just curious, you know?

15:02.446 --> 15:05.483
Wreaths, huh? Sure you didn't
wanna ask her about her shoes?

15:05.658 --> 15:07.651
I saw some nice handbags
in the foyer.

15:07.827 --> 15:09.985
- We've seen that wreath before, Dean.
- Where?

15:10.162 --> 15:13.199
The Walsh's. Yesterday.

15:13.374 --> 15:15.331
I know. I was just testing you.

15:19.213 --> 15:20.588
Yeah. All right.

15:20.756 --> 15:22.998
Well, keep looking, would you?

15:23.175 --> 15:24.504
Thanks, Bobby.

15:24.677 --> 15:28.509
Well, we're not dealing
with the Anti-Claus.

15:28.681 --> 15:29.796
What did Bobby say?

15:30.641 --> 15:31.756
That we're morons.

15:32.435 --> 15:35.886
He also said that it was probably
meadowsweet in those wreaths.

15:36.397 --> 15:39.766
Wow. Amazing.
What the hell is meadowsweet?

15:39.942 --> 15:43.145
It's pretty rare and it's the most
powerful plant in pagan lore.

15:43.654 --> 15:45.314
- Pagan lore?
- Yeah.

15:45.906 --> 15:48.029
They'd use meadowsweet
for human sacrifices.

15:48.200 --> 15:50.407
It was kind of like a chum
for their gods.

15:50.578 --> 15:54.077
Gods were drawn to it, they'd stop by
and snack on the nearest human.

15:54.248 --> 15:56.704
Why would somebody use that
for Christmas wreaths?

15:57.209 --> 15:59.001
It's not so crazy as it sounds, Dean.

15:59.170 --> 16:01.412
Pretty much every
Christmas tradition is pagan.

16:01.922 --> 16:03.333
Christmas is Jesus' birthday.

16:03.841 --> 16:08.170
Jesus' birthday was probably in the fall.
It was the winter solstice festival...

16:08.346 --> 16:10.587
...that was co-opted by the Church
and renamed.

16:10.765 --> 16:14.300
The yule log, Santa's red suit,
that's all remnants of pagan worship.

16:14.478 --> 16:16.221
How do you know that?

16:16.396 --> 16:19.563
What will you tell me next?
Easter bunny's Jewish?

16:21.151 --> 16:22.894
Think we're dealing with a pagan god?

16:23.070 --> 16:25.027
Yeah, probably Holdenacar...

16:25.197 --> 16:27.522
...god of the winter solstice.

16:28.450 --> 16:32.199
And all these Martha Stewart wannabes
buying these fancy wreaths.

16:32.371 --> 16:35.288
Yup, it's like putting a neon sign
on your front door saying:

16:35.457 --> 16:37.663
- "Come kill us. "
- Great.

16:38.669 --> 16:39.831
Huh.

16:40.003 --> 16:42.790
When you sacrifice to Holdenacar,
guess what he gives you?

16:42.965 --> 16:45.502
- Lap dances, hopefully.
- Mild weather.

16:48.220 --> 16:50.925
Like no snow in the middle
of December in Michigan.

16:51.098 --> 16:53.090
- For instance.
- Do we know how to kill it?

16:53.266 --> 16:54.809
No, Bobby's working on that now.

16:54.977 --> 16:57.812
We gotta figure out
where they're selling those wreaths.

16:57.980 --> 16:59.604
They're selling them on purpose?

16:59.773 --> 17:02.015
Feeding the victims to this thing?

17:03.735 --> 17:04.766
Let's find out.

17:13.996 --> 17:16.866
- Can I help you, boys?
- I hope so.

17:17.040 --> 17:20.242
We were playing Jenga over
at the Walsh's the other night and...

17:20.419 --> 17:22.874
Well, he hasn't shut up since
about this wreath.

17:23.046 --> 17:26.000
- I don't know. You tell him.
- Sure.

17:27.843 --> 17:29.337
It was yummy.

17:33.558 --> 17:35.716
I sell a lot of wreaths, guys.

17:35.893 --> 17:39.476
Right, right, but you see,
this one would have been really special.

17:39.647 --> 17:43.941
It had... It had green leaves,
white buds on it.

17:44.110 --> 17:46.316
Might have been made
of meadowsweet?

17:46.487 --> 17:48.978
Well, aren't you a fussy one?

17:49.157 --> 17:50.485
N...

17:50.825 --> 17:52.485
He is. Heh-heh.

17:52.660 --> 17:55.946
Anyway, I know the one
you're talking about. I'm all out.

17:56.122 --> 17:58.909
Huh. Seems like this meadowsweet
stuff's rare and expensive.

17:59.083 --> 18:01.408
- Why make wreaths out of it?
- I didn't make them.

18:02.086 --> 18:03.995
- Who did?
- Madge Carrigan, a local lady.

18:04.172 --> 18:06.841
Said they were so special,
she gave them to me for free.

18:07.008 --> 18:08.835
- She didn't charge you.
- Nope.

18:09.010 --> 18:10.837
- Sell them for free?
- It's Christmas...

18:11.012 --> 18:14.547
...people pay a butt-load for this crap.
- That's the spirit.

18:17.852 --> 18:20.770
How much do you think
a meadowsweet wreath would cost?

18:21.189 --> 18:24.723
- Couple hundred dollars, at least.
- This lady's giving them away for free?

18:24.901 --> 18:26.311
What do you think about that?

18:26.486 --> 18:29.652
Well, I'd say it's pretty suspicious.

18:31.741 --> 18:34.658
Remember that wreath
Dad brought home that one year?

18:36.329 --> 18:39.449
You mean, the one he stole from,
like, a liquor store?

18:39.624 --> 18:42.162
Yeah, it was a bunch
of empty beer cans.

18:42.335 --> 18:44.043
That thing was great.

18:44.212 --> 18:48.257
I bet if I looked around hard enough,
I could probably find one just like it.

18:48.425 --> 18:49.884
All right.

18:50.302 --> 18:53.885
- Dude, what's going on with you?
- What?

18:54.056 --> 18:58.433
Since when are you Bing Crosby?
Why do you wanna do Christmas so bad?

18:58.811 --> 19:02.227
Why are you so against it? Were your
childhood memories that traumatic?

19:02.398 --> 19:04.474
- That has nothing to do with it.
- Then what?

19:04.650 --> 19:07.651
I mean, I just... I don't get it.

19:07.820 --> 19:10.690
You haven't talked about Christmas
in years.

19:12.991 --> 19:14.106
Well, yeah.

19:15.786 --> 19:16.984
This is my last year.

19:24.753 --> 19:26.295
I know.

19:28.215 --> 19:29.757
That's why I can't.

19:31.927 --> 19:33.635
What do you mean?

19:36.640 --> 19:41.385
I mean, I can't just sit around
drinking eggnog...

19:41.562 --> 19:43.969
...pretending everything's okay...

19:44.148 --> 19:47.065
...when I know next Christmas
you'll be dead.

19:51.655 --> 19:53.564
I just can't.

20:08.006 --> 20:11.838
- Thought you went out?
- Yeah, and I got you dinner.

20:13.053 --> 20:15.129
Don't forget your vegetables.

20:25.023 --> 20:27.644
I know why you keep a gun
under your pillow.

20:31.029 --> 20:32.191
No, you don't.

20:32.363 --> 20:33.608
Stay out of my stuff.

20:34.032 --> 20:36.357
And I know why we lay salt down
everywhere we go.

20:36.534 --> 20:39.025
No, you don't. Shut up.

20:46.044 --> 20:47.918
Where did you get that? That's dad's.

20:48.088 --> 20:50.164
He's gonna kick your ass
for reading that.

20:50.840 --> 20:52.667
- Are monsters real?
- What?

20:52.842 --> 20:54.716
- You're crazy.
- Tell me.

21:05.939 --> 21:11.146
I swear, if you ever tell dad
I told you any of this, I will end you.

21:11.319 --> 21:12.778
Promise.

21:21.121 --> 21:25.914
First thing you have to know is
we have the coolest dad in the world.

21:26.419 --> 21:28.625
- He's a superhero.
- He is?

21:28.796 --> 21:30.290
Yeah.

21:31.090 --> 21:32.204
Monsters are real.

21:33.634 --> 21:35.425
Dad fights them.

21:35.594 --> 21:37.219
He's fighting them right now.

21:37.388 --> 21:40.140
But dad said the monsters under my bed
weren't real.

21:41.684 --> 21:44.471
That's because he'd already checked
under there.

21:45.688 --> 21:47.016
But, yeah, they're real.

21:48.357 --> 21:49.555
Almost everything's real.

21:50.151 --> 21:52.060
Is Santa real?

21:52.319 --> 21:53.517
No.

21:57.366 --> 22:00.901
If monsters are real, then they
could get us. They could get me.

22:01.078 --> 22:03.996
- Dad's not gonna let them get you.
- But what if they get him?

22:04.665 --> 22:06.492
They aren't gonna get dad.

22:06.667 --> 22:08.458
Dad's, like, the best.

22:10.212 --> 22:12.537
I read in dad's book
that they got mom.

22:16.552 --> 22:17.963
It's complicated, Sam.

22:18.137 --> 22:21.636
If they got mom, they can get dad.
If they can get dad, they can get us.

22:22.975 --> 22:24.255
It's not like that.

22:26.687 --> 22:27.932
Okay, dad's fine.

22:28.105 --> 22:29.849
We're fine.

22:30.441 --> 22:32.101
Trust me.

22:37.823 --> 22:41.276
- You okay?
- Yeah.

22:45.248 --> 22:47.739
You know, dad's gonna be here
for Christmas.

22:48.251 --> 22:49.449
Just like he always is.

22:53.423 --> 22:54.965
I just wanna go to sleep, okay?

22:59.846 --> 23:01.554
Yeah, okay.

23:06.645 --> 23:08.436
It'll all be better when you wake up.

23:12.067 --> 23:13.442
You'll see.

23:17.531 --> 23:19.155
Promise.

23:37.091 --> 23:39.499
So this is where Mrs. Wreath lives,
huh?

23:41.012 --> 23:44.215
Boy, can't you just feel the evil,
pagan vibe?

23:51.606 --> 23:54.097
- Yes?
- Tell me you're the Madge Carrigan...

23:54.275 --> 23:56.813
...who makes the wreaths.
- Why, yes I am.

23:56.986 --> 23:58.445
- Hah. Bingo.
- Yeah.

23:58.613 --> 24:02.612
We were just admiring your wreaths
at Mr. Silar's place the other day.

24:02.785 --> 24:03.816
You were?

24:04.286 --> 24:07.453
Isn't that meadowsweet the finest
smelling thing you ever smelled?

24:07.623 --> 24:08.702
It is. It sure is.

24:08.874 --> 24:11.792
But seem the problem is that
all your wreaths had sold out...

24:11.960 --> 24:14.452
...before we got the chance to buy one.
- Oh, fudge.

24:14.630 --> 24:17.121
You wouldn't happen to have
another one.

24:17.299 --> 24:21.048
Oh, no. I'm afraid those were
the only ones I had for this season.

24:21.220 --> 24:23.545
Why'd you decide to make them
out of meadowsweet?

24:23.722 --> 24:25.631
Why, the smell, of course.

24:25.808 --> 24:27.884
I don't think I've smelled
anything finer.

24:28.060 --> 24:31.144
- Yeah. You mentioned that.
- What's going on, honey?

24:31.313 --> 24:34.267
Well, just some nice boys,
asking about my wreaths, dear.

24:34.441 --> 24:36.767
Oh, the wreaths are fine.
Fine wreaths.

24:37.277 --> 24:39.982
Oh. Care for some peanut brittle?

24:40.364 --> 24:41.988
Ooh... Mm. Heh.

24:42.199 --> 24:43.479
We're okay.

24:49.456 --> 24:51.947
I knew it.
Something was off with those two.

24:52.126 --> 24:54.747
- What did you find?
- They lived in Seattle last year...

24:54.920 --> 24:56.829
...where two abductions took place.

24:57.005 --> 24:58.713
They moved here in January.

24:58.882 --> 25:02.168
The Christmas crap wasn't boughs
of holly, it was vervain and mint.

25:02.344 --> 25:04.384
- Pagan stuff?
- Serious pagan stuff.

25:04.555 --> 25:07.971
Ozzie and Harriett are keeping a god
hidden underneath their couch?

25:08.142 --> 25:10.514
All I know is
we gotta check them out.

25:11.186 --> 25:15.101
What about Bobby? He's sure evergreen
stakes will kill this thing, right?

25:15.441 --> 25:17.434
Yeah, he's sure.

25:43.428 --> 25:45.753
See, plastic.

26:23.301 --> 26:24.332
Hey, Dean.

27:05.302 --> 27:06.761
Oh.

27:52.976 --> 27:54.174
Aah!
- Sam!

28:07.657 --> 28:11.821
Gosh, I wish you boys
hadn't come down here.

28:34.851 --> 28:36.262
Dean?

28:37.187 --> 28:38.847
Are you okay?

28:39.648 --> 28:41.605
Yeah, I think so.

28:42.442 --> 28:46.025
So I guess we're dealing
with Mr. And Mrs. God.

28:46.363 --> 28:48.521
- Nice to know.
- Yeah.

28:48.698 --> 28:51.368
Oh, and here we thought
you two lazybones...

28:51.535 --> 28:54.322
...were gonna sleep straight through
all the fun stuff. Ha-ha.

28:54.496 --> 28:58.576
- And miss all this? No, we're partiers.
- Isn't he a kick in the pants, honey?

28:58.750 --> 29:00.826
You're hunters, is what you are.

29:01.002 --> 29:02.331
Yeah, and you're pagan gods.

29:02.504 --> 29:05.077
So why don't we call it even
and go our separate ways?

29:05.257 --> 29:08.756
What, so you can bring back more
hunters and kill us? I don't think so.

29:08.927 --> 29:12.012
You should have thought that
before you went snacking on humans.

29:12.181 --> 29:13.592
- Oh, now, don't get all wet.
- Ho.

29:13.766 --> 29:17.301
Why, we used to take over
a hundred tributes a year.

29:17.478 --> 29:19.720
And that's a fact.

29:19.897 --> 29:22.898
Now, what do we take,
what, two, three?

29:23.442 --> 29:25.898
- Uhn.
- Hardy Boys here make five.

29:27.864 --> 29:29.856
Now, that's not so bad, is it?

29:30.032 --> 29:32.191
You say it like that,
you are the Cunninghams.

29:32.368 --> 29:34.325
You better show us a little respect.

29:34.495 --> 29:35.610
Or what?

29:36.122 --> 29:38.245
- You'll eat us?
Not so fast.

29:38.416 --> 29:42.200
- There's rituals to be followed first.
- Oh, we're just sticklers for ritual.

29:43.296 --> 29:45.122
You know what kicks off
the shebang?

29:45.298 --> 29:47.041
Let me guess. Meadowsweet.

29:47.216 --> 29:49.173
Oh, shucks, you're all out of wreaths.

29:49.343 --> 29:51.502
I guess we'll have
to cancel the sacrifice.

29:52.346 --> 29:54.672
Don't be such a gloomy Gus.

29:55.308 --> 29:56.766
There.

29:57.101 --> 29:58.975
Oh.

29:59.312 --> 30:01.600
Don't they just look darling?

30:01.772 --> 30:03.148
Good enough to eat.

30:05.067 --> 30:08.816
Alrighty-roo, step number two.

30:13.201 --> 30:14.944
- Sammy.
No.

30:15.119 --> 30:16.494
- Sammy?
No, no, don't.

30:16.662 --> 30:19.367
- Aah!
- Leave him alone, you son of a bitch!

30:19.832 --> 30:22.750
You hear how they talk to us?
Ha-ha. To gods?

30:22.919 --> 30:25.919
Listen, pal, back in the day,
we were worshipped by millions.

30:26.088 --> 30:28.378
- Times have changed.
- Ha. Tell me about it.

30:28.550 --> 30:31.753
All of a sudden, this Jesus character's
the hot, new thing in town.

30:31.929 --> 30:35.843
Our altars are being burned down and
we're being hunted down like monsters.

30:36.016 --> 30:40.345
But did we say peep?
Oh, no, no, no, we did not.

30:40.521 --> 30:42.394
Two millennium.

30:42.564 --> 30:46.432
We kept a low profile,
we got jobs, a mortgage.

30:46.944 --> 30:49.435
- We... What was that word, dear?
- We assimilated.

30:49.613 --> 30:51.356
Yeah, we assimilated.

30:51.532 --> 30:54.153
Why, we play bridge on Tuesdays
and Fridays.

30:54.326 --> 30:55.904
We're just like everybody else.

30:56.078 --> 30:58.035
You're not blending like you think,
lady.

30:58.205 --> 31:00.778
This might pinch a bit, dear.

31:01.041 --> 31:02.998
Aah! You bitch!

31:03.502 --> 31:05.079
Oh, my goodness, me.

31:05.254 --> 31:07.211
Somebody owes a nickel
to the swear jar.

31:07.965 --> 31:11.749
Oh, do you know what I say
when I feel like swearing? Fudge.

31:12.678 --> 31:14.006
I'll try and remember that.

31:14.179 --> 31:16.753
You boys have no idea
how lucky you are.

31:16.932 --> 31:19.553
There was a time when
kids came from miles around...

31:19.726 --> 31:23.060
...just to be sitting where you are.
- What do you think you're doing?

31:23.855 --> 31:26.477
You fudging touch me again,
I'll fudging kill you!

31:26.650 --> 31:28.025
Very good.

31:29.987 --> 31:31.695
Aah!

31:36.201 --> 31:38.194
No. No, don't.

31:47.338 --> 31:49.295
Oh-ho. We've got a winner.

32:03.146 --> 32:05.851
- What else, dear?
Well, let's see.

32:06.024 --> 32:08.100
Fingernail, blood. Oh!

32:08.276 --> 32:11.443
Sweet Peter on a Popsicle stick.
Heh. I forgot the tooth.

32:11.654 --> 32:13.730
- Ha-ha-ha.
Oh, dear.

32:14.949 --> 32:16.776
- Merry Christmas, Sam.
- Mm.

32:22.206 --> 32:24.780
- Open wide and say: Aah.
- Ach!

32:25.460 --> 32:26.740
Aah!

32:30.131 --> 32:31.506
So are you gonna get that?

32:33.468 --> 32:35.092
You should get that.

32:38.932 --> 32:40.639
Come on.

32:43.937 --> 32:45.514
Merry Christmas.

32:45.688 --> 32:48.179
- I told you I smelled fruitcake.
- You shouldn't have.

32:48.358 --> 32:50.979
- Oh. Bite your tongue. It's my pleasure.
- Looks scrumptious.

32:51.152 --> 32:53.145
We're going caroling, care to join?

32:53.321 --> 32:54.400
You know we would...

32:54.572 --> 32:57.359
It's my back.
Darn thing's giving me fits.

32:57.533 --> 32:59.028
That's a shame.

32:59.202 --> 33:01.360
- Oh, well, Merry Christmas.
- And to you too.

33:01.537 --> 33:04.160
- Are we still on for bridge tomorrow?
- With bells on.

33:04.333 --> 33:06.326
- Yes. Okay, bye.
- Bye-bye.

33:15.386 --> 33:17.877
Ah. Where were we?

33:32.194 --> 33:34.602
What do we do now?
The stakes are in the basement.

33:34.780 --> 33:37.318
Well, we need more evergreen, Dean.

33:38.784 --> 33:41.109
I think I just found us some more.

33:41.287 --> 33:43.113
Help me get this.

34:15.654 --> 34:18.228
You little thing.

34:18.699 --> 34:20.857
I loved that tree.

34:31.963 --> 34:33.373
Madge!

35:04.788 --> 35:06.448
Merry Christmas.

35:27.702 --> 35:29.659
Sam, wake up.

35:31.706 --> 35:33.912
Dad was here. Look what he brought.

35:34.083 --> 35:36.574
- Dad was here?
- Yeah.

35:36.753 --> 35:38.579
Look at this. We made a killing.

35:40.174 --> 35:41.716
Why didn't he try to wake me up?

35:43.260 --> 35:45.004
He tried to, like, a thousand times.

35:46.013 --> 35:47.092
He did?

35:47.598 --> 35:50.883
Yeah. Did I tell you he would
give us Christmas or what?

35:52.311 --> 35:53.342
Go on. Dive in.

36:08.243 --> 36:09.821
What is it?

36:10.496 --> 36:11.906
Sapphire Barbie?

36:12.956 --> 36:16.160
- Heh. Dad probably thinks you're a girl.
- Shut up.

36:16.335 --> 36:17.580
Open that one.

36:27.304 --> 36:29.842
- Dad never showed, did he?
- Yeah, he did. I swear.

36:30.891 --> 36:32.931
Dean, where did you get all this stuff?

36:38.524 --> 36:39.852
Nice house up the block.

36:42.194 --> 36:45.693
I swear, I didn't know
they were chick presents.

36:47.991 --> 36:50.482
Look, I'm sure dad
would have been here if he could.

36:51.286 --> 36:53.445
- Lf he's alive.
- Don't say that.

36:53.997 --> 36:55.955
Of course he's alive.

36:56.125 --> 36:57.750
He's dad.

37:05.510 --> 37:06.708
Here.

37:06.928 --> 37:09.217
- Take this.
- No.

37:09.389 --> 37:11.180
No, that's for dad.

37:11.349 --> 37:13.342
Dad lied to me.

37:13.601 --> 37:14.882
I want you to have it.

37:19.023 --> 37:20.683
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

37:38.501 --> 37:40.541
Thank you, Sam. L...

37:40.712 --> 37:42.455
I love it.

38:00.899 --> 38:02.975
Hey, you get the beer?

38:03.485 --> 38:05.109
What's all this?

38:05.445 --> 38:06.690
What do you think it is?

38:06.863 --> 38:08.026
It's Christmas.

38:13.953 --> 38:15.698
What made you change your mind?

38:18.834 --> 38:23.164
Here, try the eggnog.

38:24.340 --> 38:26.665
Let me know
if it needs some more kick.

38:31.347 --> 38:32.378
- No, we're good.
- Yeah?

38:32.556 --> 38:33.754
- Yeah.
- Good.

38:33.933 --> 38:39.389
Well, have a seat.
Let's do Christmas stuff or whatever.

38:39.730 --> 38:41.557
All right, first thing's first.

38:50.407 --> 38:52.365
Merry Christmas, Sam.

38:54.537 --> 38:57.158
- Where did you get these?
- Someplace special.

38:57.873 --> 38:59.451
- Gas mart down the street.
- Ha-ha-ha.

38:59.625 --> 39:00.656
Open them up.

39:01.252 --> 39:02.497
Yeah.

39:02.711 --> 39:05.796
- Great minds think alike, Dean.
- Really?

39:05.965 --> 39:07.340
Here you go.

39:07.508 --> 39:09.547
Oh, come on.

39:10.636 --> 39:12.130
Yeah.

39:12.638 --> 39:14.465

39:16.475 --> 39:17.554

39:17.726 --> 39:19.269
You like?

Well, look at this.
Fuel for me and fuel for my baby.
