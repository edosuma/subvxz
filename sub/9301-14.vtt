WEBVTT

00:00.953 --> 00:02.178
He-Man.

00:02.220 --> 00:06.478
And the Masters of the Universe.

00:06.520 --> 00:08.378
I am Adam, Prince of Eternia.

00:08.420 --> 00:09.539
Defender of the

00:09.564 --> 00:11.778
secrets of Castle Grayskull.

00:11.820 --> 00:15.943
This is Cringer, my fearless friend.

00:15.986 --> 00:17.844
Fabulous secret powers were revealed

00:17.869 --> 00:19.978
to me the day I held aloft

00:20.020 --> 00:22.154
my magic sword and said,

00:22.179 --> 00:24.668
by the power of Grayskull.

00:27.420 --> 00:31.578
I have the power!

00:38.786 --> 00:39.913
Cringer became the

00:39.938 --> 00:41.978
mighty Battle Cat, and I became

00:42.020 --> 00:43.876
He-Man, the most

00:43.901 --> 00:46.402
powerful man in the universe.

00:49.286 --> 00:51.778
Only three others share this secret:

00:52.620 --> 00:54.851
Our friends the Sorceress,

00:54.876 --> 00:56.911
Man-at-Arms, and Orko.

00:56.935 --> 00:59.588
Together we defend Castle Grayskull from,

00:59.613 --> 01:02.117
the evil forces of Skeletor.

01:44.443 --> 01:46.604
Hm... You called?

01:47.446 --> 01:49.744
Yes, you lazy creature.

01:49.981 --> 01:53.246
While you were sleeping,
I finished my greatest creation.

01:53.618 --> 01:54.983
The Collector!

01:58.924 --> 02:01.484
With the huge energy converter
built into this ship...

02:01.693 --> 02:05.424
I can carry out my plan,
to rule all of Eternia.

02:17.743 --> 02:19.370
Checkmate!

02:20.378 --> 02:22.812
Well, looks like he's got you
this time, Orko.

02:23.648 --> 02:25.047
Looks aren't everything!

02:43.301 --> 02:45.504
What in Eternia is going on?

02:45.504 --> 02:47.495
Better take cover, Your Highness.

02:49.207 --> 02:51.471
Come on, Cringer.  We're needed.

02:52.444 --> 02:55.277
B-b-but we could t-turn to stone.

03:07.959 --> 03:10.894
Wh-wh-wh-why don't you
go on ahead without me,

03:11.196 --> 03:13.790
I-I-I I make a lousy statue.

03:14.199 --> 03:16.690
By the power of Grayskull.

03:24.042 --> 03:28.172
I have the power!

03:43.395 --> 03:45.989
You don't scare me!

03:51.169 --> 03:52.169
Father!

03:59.277 --> 04:00.369
Look out, Teela.

04:06.151 --> 04:07.243
Are you alright, Teela?

04:07.485 --> 04:08.679
Yes, but my father...

04:08.987 --> 04:10.955
We must find a way to change him back.

04:11.156 --> 04:13.556
If there's a way, we'll find it.

04:18.329 --> 04:22.857
Amazing! You turned him to stone.

04:23.701 --> 04:25.760
Of course I did, fur brain,

04:25.804 --> 04:28.864
and if you think that's
impressive, watch this.

04:32.010 --> 04:34.808
How about bringing stone to life!

04:55.901 --> 04:58.426
Boy, am I glad to see you guys.

04:58.770 --> 05:01.102
It's a good thing we were
in the neighbourhood.

05:19.891 --> 05:21.859
Catch me if you can, pebble brain.

05:34.205 --> 05:36.833
He-Man's allies are more clever...

05:37.042 --> 05:39.476
than you thought, Skeletor.

05:40.578 --> 05:42.603
Not half as clever as you think.

05:48.186 --> 05:49.881
Wait here, Battle Cat.

05:56.428 --> 05:59.261
Whoever that is,
an ion blast should scare him off.

06:04.035 --> 06:05.332
Oh really?

06:07.038 --> 06:09.563
He-Man, I'll take care of you.

06:11.543 --> 06:14.603
Danger, emergency override.

06:14.879 --> 06:19.009
Automatic pilot engaged, beginning landing.

07:06.664 --> 07:08.689
Teela, what happened?

07:08.933 --> 07:10.901
My father's been turned to stone.

07:11.136 --> 07:14.196
We'll find the answer to this, my friend.

07:14.372 --> 07:16.699
I don't understand all of
Man-At-Arms' inventions, but...

07:16.775 --> 07:19.573
my Earth science training should help us.

07:27.452 --> 07:29.420
Isn't there anything you can
do, Mother?

07:29.587 --> 07:31.145
I'm afraid, not.

07:31.222 --> 07:34.487
As far as I can tell, this will be
permanent at sundown.

07:34.626 --> 07:36.359
Then there are only only a few hours left.

07:36.361 --> 07:37.589
Come, my friend.

07:38.029 --> 07:40.122
I know, someone who could help us.

07:50.408 --> 07:53.741
Follow me, Beast,
and don't drop the energizer.

07:53.978 --> 07:58.176
Someday you won't
order me around, Skeletor.

08:09.194 --> 08:10.821
A little more energy
should be enough...

08:11.029 --> 08:13.054
to bring the Colossor to life.

08:19.704 --> 08:22.935
Soon, Eternia will be all mine!

08:24.342 --> 08:25.832
Can you help us, Sorceress?

08:26.044 --> 08:28.103
We must find the answer before nightfall,

08:28.413 --> 08:30.677
or it will be too late to save Man-At-Arms.

08:31.116 --> 08:33.346
This menace is larger than you imagine.

08:33.551 --> 08:35.815
You will walk through
fire before it is over.

08:36.154 --> 08:38.280
Seek the fire-jewels, He-Man.

08:38.690 --> 08:41.488
Only they can save Man-At-Arms.

08:41.726 --> 08:44.695
I will need help, on this quest.

09:00.545 --> 09:01.978
Evil-Lyn, what do you want?

09:02.180 --> 09:03.977
Your power, Skeletor.

09:08.653 --> 09:11.520
You try my patience, witch.

09:11.890 --> 09:13.517
He-Man has been to see the Sorceress.

09:13.725 --> 09:16.421
He must be on his way
to get the Fire Jewels...

09:16.761 --> 09:19.924
and you think he's not clever?

09:22.500 --> 09:24.900
You better be twice as clever...

09:25.170 --> 09:28.401
or I'll make a rug out of you.
Stop He-Man!

09:47.959 --> 09:52.521
One more tankful of energy,
and Colossor will live.

10:06.711 --> 10:09.202
No luck.
I can't find those equations.

10:09.414 --> 10:12.747
We better find them soon.
The Sun is almost down.

10:19.791 --> 10:20.587
Orko!

10:22.227 --> 10:23.216
What an awful place.

10:23.394 --> 10:26.295
Well it's gloomy, Teela,
but at least it's not dangerous.

10:30.401 --> 10:32.170
Not dangerous, you say?

10:32.170 --> 10:34.105
Well, Swamp Bats are nasty...

10:34.105 --> 10:36.232
but they don't usually attack
if you leave them alone.

10:37.308 --> 10:40.835
Swamp Bat, attack them!

10:41.045 --> 10:41.704
Beast Man!

10:42.213 --> 10:45.182
So, Skeletor's behind this.

10:45.383 --> 10:48.318
Maybe a Flashball will lighten our problem,

10:55.059 --> 10:56.993
and as for you, Beast Man...

10:59.530 --> 11:02.260
I'll deal with you later. Let's go!

11:04.702 --> 11:07.637
The Fire Jewels are the
only things that can help us,

11:07.972 --> 11:09.266
and we're running out of time.

11:09.774 --> 11:13.505
Wait here and stand guard.
This shouldn't take too long.

11:49.314 --> 11:50.508
He-Man, look out!

12:01.692 --> 12:04.354
Well, did you take care of
He-Man, Beastie?

12:04.729 --> 12:07.220
I'm afraid, Skeletor...

12:07.699 --> 12:10.964
that He-Man is smarter
than you thought.

12:11.069 --> 12:12.036
What?

12:20.545 --> 12:23.742
At last, nothing can stop me now...

12:23.981 --> 12:26.108
not even He-Man!

12:40.698 --> 12:41.926
Teela, catch!

12:57.849 --> 12:59.942
Let's get these back to the Sorceress.

13:00.318 --> 13:02.149
Time is running out.

13:04.989 --> 13:08.186
Who has awakened me?

13:08.426 --> 13:12.362
I, Skeletor, Master of the
Universe, have awakened you,

13:13.264 --> 13:17.325
and I command you,
capture Castle Grayskull.

13:17.869 --> 13:21.396
Capture Castle Grayskull.

13:23.274 --> 13:27.404
At last,
The secrets of Grayskull will be mine!

13:32.216 --> 13:34.650
With these we can defeat Skeletor.

13:35.252 --> 13:40.212
Now, the Fire Jewels have to be
crushed, into fine powder.

13:40.324 --> 13:42.224
I think that can be arranged.

13:53.271 --> 13:56.297
Contact with this Ray Fuser will
cause Skeletor's two rays...

13:56.441 --> 13:57.703
to fuse into one.

13:58.042 --> 14:01.375
The new ray will give
life back to our friends.

14:01.579 --> 14:02.876
-Contact?.

14:03.181 --> 14:06.284
The Ray Fuser will have to touch
the controls for both rays...

14:06.284 --> 14:07.581
to fuse them into one.

14:07.919 --> 14:09.614
We'll make sure it does.

14:10.288 --> 14:11.346
Let's go.

14:20.097 --> 14:22.190
You two stand guard here,

14:22.500 --> 14:25.094
while I pay a visit to the Skeletor.

14:30.475 --> 14:32.943
Well, I guess it's just, you and me.

14:37.482 --> 14:40.383
That sounds like big trouble. Let's go!

15:01.706 --> 15:03.908
Are we flying backwards, Beastie?

15:03.908 --> 15:06.468
Why haven't we reached Castle Grayskull?

15:07.178 --> 15:09.976
Let's go back to Snake Mountain.

15:10.181 --> 15:13.082
Colossor can capture
Grayskull without our help.

15:13.351 --> 15:16.548
Colossor will capture Grayskull...

15:17.421 --> 15:19.582
and I'll be there to watch.

15:25.129 --> 15:26.096
He-Man!

15:45.883 --> 15:46.907
Take him!

15:47.418 --> 15:49.443
It won't be that easy, Skeletor.

16:08.072 --> 16:08.970
He-Man...

16:09.574 --> 16:13.135
There is trouble in Grayskull.
Come quickly!

16:17.281 --> 16:20.580
You can't survive a fall from this
height, He-Man.

16:21.118 --> 16:23.712
I won't have to, Skeletor.

16:37.401 --> 16:38.925
Out of my way, Beast.

16:58.022 --> 16:59.785
This is our last chance.

17:00.024 --> 17:02.925
The Sun's almost down.
It's now or never!

17:03.995 --> 17:04.962
Take cover.

17:09.700 --> 17:11.724
Now I've got you all.

17:18.409 --> 17:22.209
A green ray?
You will pay for this, He-Man.

17:26.884 --> 17:29.079
That's the longest
I've ever stayed still.

17:31.255 --> 17:33.086
There's trouble at Grayskull.

17:33.157 --> 17:35.455
Teela and Battle Cat
are there with the Sorceress.

17:35.660 --> 17:36.627
Let's go!

17:54.779 --> 17:57.646
And I thought nothing could
be worse than the volcano.

18:07.758 --> 18:08.884
He-Man!

18:26.177 --> 18:28.543
Time for some magic, I hope.

18:28.779 --> 18:30.884
Powerful sun,
lend me your might,

18:30.909 --> 18:33.870
slow down the giant
with flashes of light.

18:37.855 --> 18:39.049
It worked!

18:45.796 --> 18:47.195
Now, Stratos.

18:57.241 --> 18:59.573
Colossor's down,

19:00.144 --> 19:01.839
but not out.

19:14.592 --> 19:15.923
He-Man!

19:20.831 --> 19:22.594
Alright!

19:27.438 --> 19:29.599
It's not over yet.  Look!

19:34.945 --> 19:37.846
Now, He-Man, I will have my revenge.

19:45.456 --> 19:47.720
Why do I have the
feeling, he'll be back?

19:47.925 --> 19:49.392
Oh, he'll be back alright...

19:50.060 --> 19:52.221
but we'll be waiting for him.

20:02.506 --> 20:05.532
...and then I used my magic
to knock Colossor over,

20:05.776 --> 20:08.939
and then I took care of the Skeletor,
and then...

20:11.782 --> 20:13.215
Colossor is back!

20:15.419 --> 20:17.250
It's only me.

20:17.588 --> 20:20.751
I knew it was you, I knew it all the time.

20:28.399 --> 20:30.333
I love running at this time of day.

20:30.534 --> 20:33.002
Yeah, me too.
Makes me feel close to nature.

20:33.204 --> 20:35.866
The best part is that
it's wonderful exercise.

20:36.040 --> 20:37.007
It's the best.

20:37.208 --> 20:38.577
Of course, one should check with a

20:38.602 --> 20:40.165
doctor before doing any heavy exercise.

20:40.411 --> 20:43.278
Right, and then start off
just a little each day.

20:43.514 --> 20:45.277
I sure wish we could
tell that to everybody.

20:45.482 --> 20:46.972
I think we just did.
We did?

20:47.284 --> 20:48.273
See for your self.

20:48.485 --> 20:52.216
Remember, be good to your
body and it'll be good to you.

20:52.423 --> 20:53.481
Well said, He-Man.

20:53.724 --> 20:55.817
Now, I'll race you to the tree!
