(SNIFFING)

10:41.107 --> 10:44.109
Oh, my!
Did someone go boom-boom?

10:44.111 --> 10:46.411
What is your father
feeding you?

10:46.413 --> 10:48.246
(BABY GIGGLING)

11:01.894 --> 11:04.629
<i>We have a winner!</i>

11:05.898 --> 11:09.634
Why would she touch it?
And what are they saving
them for?

11:09.636 --> 11:14.205
I don't know.
And I don't ever
want to know either!

11:14.207 --> 11:15.807
We must never
speak of this again.

11:15.809 --> 11:19.511
MAVIS: (STAMMERING)
It's a deal, Aunt Lydia.

11:20.546 --> 11:22.614

11:29.955 --> 11:31.289
Hey!

11:31.291 --> 11:32.924
(GRUNTING)

11:33.526 --> 11:37.462
Boom! You just got Pedro'd!

11:38.097 --> 11:43.268
My mother said
"Sheldon, why not become
a doctor or a lawyer?"

11:43.270 --> 11:47.038
But, no, I had to weave nets.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.708
Mavis, Mavis, over here!

11:49.710 --> 11:51.309
My turn!

11:53.746 --> 11:56.014
Rats! I thought I had it!

11:56.016 --> 11:56.948
It's okay, man.

11:56.950 --> 11:58.316
You're good at
doing other stuff,

11:58.318 --> 12:01.252
like watching me do
my victory dance! Kick it!

12:01.254 --> 12:03.054
(GRUNTING)

12:03.389 --> 12:04.756
Oh, man.

12:04.758 --> 12:06.157
(GRUNTING)

12:08.461 --> 12:12.297
And that's how
you play basketball!

12:12.299 --> 12:13.932
Boom-Drac-alakca!

12:13.934 --> 12:15.500
I got this!

12:15.502 --> 12:17.102
Yeah, right.

12:17.104 --> 12:21.473
Would it kill you
to at least pretend
he's going to score?

12:21.807 --> 12:23.475
(GRUNTING)

12:24.777 --> 12:26.144
Ah!

12:28.748 --> 12:30.815
Oh, stitches!

12:30.817 --> 12:35.420
Poor guy, too bad he's just...
How do I say this?

12:35.422 --> 12:38.423
Really good
at being not very great.

12:38.425 --> 12:43.194
If only there was
a way to give him
the gift of basketball.

12:43.196 --> 12:45.530
(GASP) Wait a sec.
That's it.

12:45.532 --> 12:48.066
I'll give him
the gift of basketball!

12:48.068 --> 12:49.167
You and gifts? No.

12:49.169 --> 12:52.670
What are you talking about?
I'm an amazing gift giver.

12:52.672 --> 12:53.838
Right, Wendy?

12:53.840 --> 12:54.906
Okay, how do I say this?

12:54.908 --> 13:00.245
Some of your presents
are really good at being
not very great!

13:00.247 --> 13:01.780
Name one.

13:02.548 --> 13:05.950
Uncle Archie?
Is that you?

13:06.786 --> 13:09.888
Great, an invisible tie.

13:11.323 --> 13:13.024
(SCREAMING)

13:13.026 --> 13:15.727
This time,
it's going to be different.

13:15.729 --> 13:18.029
I know just what Hank needs.

13:18.031 --> 13:19.531
HANK: Help.

13:21.700 --> 13:23.168
Whoa!

13:24.837 --> 13:26.771
Two points!
Yay!

13:26.773 --> 13:28.840
No, no, no, no, no, no.

13:28.842 --> 13:30.141
Ah!

Famous Igors,
wicked step-monsters,

faceless henchmen.
Ooh, there it is, athletes!

13:41.086 --> 13:44.189
Hmm, is this the one?

13:45.157 --> 13:47.125
(GRUNTING)

13:48.794 --> 13:51.062
Only one way to find out.

13:52.298 --> 13:54.199
(RUMBLING)

13:55.134 --> 13:55.667
Boom!

13:55.669 --> 13:57.936
Guess whose gravestone's
going to say

13:57.938 --> 14:00.438
"here lies
an amazing gift giver!"

14:00.440 --> 14:02.106
(THUNDERING)

14:02.108 --> 14:04.809
Hmm, got any fours?

14:05.444 --> 14:08.246
No. Go fish.

14:10.149 --> 14:11.549
(SCREAMING)

14:11.551 --> 14:12.817
Ha! Fished my wish!

14:12.819 --> 14:14.786
Did someone say "Wish"?

14:14.788 --> 14:17.722
No need for those
when you've got Mavis,

14:17.724 --> 14:20.758
the greatest
gift giver around!

14:21.026 --> 14:23.428
For me? Wait a sec.

14:23.430 --> 14:26.164
It's not going to
try to kill me, is it?

14:27.299 --> 14:28.700
As if!

14:29.668 --> 14:30.869
Ooh! Antlers!

14:30.871 --> 14:34.272
What's he going to do
with extra hands? Clap more?

14:34.274 --> 14:35.373
Oh, oh, I don't know,

14:35.375 --> 14:39.744
maybe play basketball
super awesomely?

14:41.080 --> 14:43.514
Whoa! Cool!

14:43.516 --> 14:45.350
(SPITTING)

14:45.851 --> 14:48.219
Look! I'm already
clapping more!

14:48.221 --> 14:49.954
Fits like a gloves!

14:49.956 --> 14:53.024
I got to take these puppies
for a test drive.

14:57.062 --> 14:57.862
(WHIMPERING)

14:57.864 --> 15:00.331
Oh, yeah, who's got
two thumbs pointing at her

15:00.333 --> 15:04.369
and is the
best gift giver ever?
This vampire!

15:09.141 --> 15:13.177
Yes! Mama,
there goes that man!

15:13.479 --> 15:18.316
And that's a slam-dunk
for Mavis's gift-giving!

15:18.517 --> 15:20.785
Oh, also, yay, Hank!

15:35.668 --> 15:37.869
Okay, that's it. I quit!

15:37.871 --> 15:42.340
Mavis, I'll never, ever forget
who gave me these hands.

15:42.342 --> 15:46.377
I can't wait to see
what else these guys can do!

15:46.478 --> 15:49.914
Whoa, way to stay in shape,
new hands!

15:49.916 --> 15:54.385
Old hands used to take breaks
all the time, so lazy.

16:03.095 --> 16:04.329
(TOILET FLUSHING)

16:04.331 --> 16:08.099
Uh, guys,
it's been a lot of fun.

16:08.101 --> 16:09.167
But believe it or not,

16:09.169 --> 16:11.769
there's more to life
than just basketball.

16:11.771 --> 16:14.339
I'm not saying balling
isn't super important.

16:14.341 --> 16:19.677
But maybe we could, you know,
try brushing my teeth?

16:20.145 --> 16:22.780
Nice. Thanks, guys.

16:22.782 --> 16:23.581
Ow!

16:23.583 --> 16:27.151
Hey, uh, easy or you'll
hit my brain.

16:27.353 --> 16:28.987
(GROANING)

16:32.257 --> 16:35.660
Ow. Ow. Ow.

16:36.295 --> 16:37.462
Oh, good, you're up.

16:37.464 --> 16:39.664
Remind me to
never give you a job

16:39.666 --> 16:41.733
in the wake-up
call department.

16:41.735 --> 16:43.134
Mavis, you got to help me.

16:43.136 --> 16:47.538
Sorry. The gift-giving
help desk is closed for sleep.

16:47.540 --> 16:49.841
But this is
a gift-giving complaint!

16:49.843 --> 16:52.777
A gift-giving who-what-now?

16:52.978 --> 16:55.713
I can't eat. I can't sleep.

16:55.715 --> 16:57.015
And you don't even
want to know

16:57.017 --> 16:59.450
what going to the bathroom
is like, okay?

16:59.452 --> 17:01.786
Um, maybe don't touch
anything, okay?

17:01.788 --> 17:05.957
They're awesome
at basketball and terrible
at everything else!

17:05.959 --> 17:08.226
Um, have you tried
taking them off?

17:08.228 --> 17:11.529
Oh, you know,
I never thought of that.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.531
Of course I thought of that!

17:13.898 --> 17:15.133
Ow!

17:18.537 --> 17:21.638
Holy rabies, this is a job
for a professional,

17:21.641 --> 17:24.442
or something close to one.

17:24.444 --> 17:29.514
Mm-hmm, uh-huh,
just as I suspected.

17:29.715 --> 17:32.784
These are definitely hands.

17:32.786 --> 17:37.922
We know what they are!
We need to know how
to get them off!

17:40.392 --> 17:43.027
Classic case
of reverse limb rejection.

17:43.029 --> 17:45.730
They're too comfy cozy
on Hank's arms.

17:45.732 --> 17:50.134
The only cure is to have your
old hands reclaim their spot.

17:50.136 --> 17:52.403
Hopefully, you've put them
somewhere safe.

17:52.405 --> 17:56.641
What if, by accident,
Hank threw away his old hands

17:56.643 --> 17:59.077
like they were
totally worthless?

18:01.947 --> 18:07.118
I have just the prescription.
You've got to woo 'em.

18:07.120 --> 18:10.655
Uhh, "Woo"? How do we woo?

18:11.490 --> 18:12.390
If I knew that,

18:12.392 --> 18:17.028
I'd still have
my old girlfriend
and my ex-dog!

18:17.030 --> 18:19.097
Gone! Gone!

18:19.099 --> 18:23.434
Don't worry. I have a plan.
And it involves wooing gifts.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.036
You know how to "Woo"?

18:25.038 --> 18:26.637
You don't get to be 114

18:26.639 --> 18:29.273
without reading a few
Teen Fang Magazines.

18:29.275 --> 18:31.742
We need flowers
and grand gestures!

18:31.744 --> 18:34.512
What about, uh,
you know who?

18:35.047 --> 18:36.314
Oh!

18:36.548 --> 18:37.548
They're staying here.

18:37.550 --> 18:40.918
I have just the body-sitters
for the job.

18:41.386 --> 18:44.255
Uhh, we're not flying high,
are we?

18:44.257 --> 18:46.457
Oh, no, no, not at all.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.960
What's tickling my chin?

18:49.228 --> 18:51.262
Uh, blades of grass.

18:51.264 --> 18:55.166
Ooh, roses for wooing!
Open wide.

18:56.869 --> 18:58.903
Hank! I see your hands!

19:01.006 --> 19:03.474
(MUFFLED)
Here, these are for you.

19:03.476 --> 19:07.278
He says
"Here, these are for you."

19:07.280 --> 19:08.579
Huh?

19:13.886 --> 19:16.487
This next song
goes out to Hank's hands,

19:16.489 --> 19:19.223
from his head and his heart.

19:37.710 --> 19:39.610
Think of the good times,
like, uh,

19:39.612 --> 19:43.447
when we'd play pull my finger
to freak out the wolf pups!

19:43.449 --> 19:47.618
Or how you'd clean dandruff
off my shoulder
and pretend it's snow?

19:47.620 --> 19:49.954
Aww, happy memories,
good times!

19:49.956 --> 19:54.592
It's working!
It's totally disgusting.
But it's working.

19:54.594 --> 19:57.828
It's just not the same
without you!

20:01.333 --> 20:05.069
Aww, I missed you so much too!
