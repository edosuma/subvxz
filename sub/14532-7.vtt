WEBVTT

00:04.421 --> 00:05.798
Previously on "Power"...

00:05.964 --> 00:08.683
- We got to kill Lobos.
- What you gonna do about an alibi?

00:08.842 --> 00:09.934
I can use Karen.

00:10.093 --> 00:12.529
I just wanted to know if you were willing
to move our meeting tomorrow

00:12.554 --> 00:14.994
- to the Odette on the Hudson.
- You must be Mrs. St. Patrick.

00:15.098 --> 00:16.270
Call me Tasha.

00:16.433 --> 00:19.027
We transfer Lobos to D.C.
and this is all behind us, right?

00:19.186 --> 00:21.386
Once I have all the info
you can contact your associates

00:21.411 --> 00:22.811
on the outside
to make arrangements.

00:27.361 --> 00:29.841
After I got popped, they went
straight for Lobos's GPS tracker,

00:29.866 --> 00:31.953
which means we've got
a big fucking leak.

00:32.115 --> 00:33.458
Fuck, is that a phone?

00:33.617 --> 00:36.461
- Ghost, we said no phones!
- I need to end this now, Tommy.

00:38.330 --> 00:39.798
You picked Ghost over me.

00:39.957 --> 00:42.277
Trust me, I promise you,
I'm right where you want me to be.

00:42.302 --> 00:45.296
You get a card like that,
it means you're in trouble.

00:45.462 --> 00:47.715
Good evening, sir.
I'm here to visit a friend,

00:47.881 --> 00:49.303
Tatiana Boriskaya.

00:49.466 --> 00:51.639
- Did you get my message?
- Milan.

00:51.802 --> 00:53.099
Nice to meet you.

00:53.262 --> 00:55.062
Yo, he's been working for you
this whole time?

00:55.180 --> 00:58.104
That motherfucker say we're going back
to work for him, to pay him back.

00:58.267 --> 01:00.315
Angela, she's a liability.

01:00.477 --> 01:03.447
You can't even tell her
that the Serbians are after her.

01:03.605 --> 01:06.199
We can't be together, Angie.

That this was all a fantasy,

that we were letting
our 15-year-old selves dictate our future.

I'll never let them.

He was still married.

04:40.572 --> 04:42.745
He showed me his separation papers.

04:42.908 --> 04:44.501
Were they signed?

05:00.175 --> 05:02.052
How could he do this to me?

Come in.

05:27.369 --> 05:29.417
What are you doing here?

05:29.579 --> 05:30.956
This is my sister, Paz.

05:31.122 --> 05:33.250
- Hi, Tim.
- Hello.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.587
Valdes, I need you to come with me.

05:36.753 --> 05:39.302
- Why?
- I can't say.

05:39.464 --> 05:41.387
I really can't.

05:41.550 --> 05:44.178
Get your laptop and your phone.
Let's go.

06:02.445 --> 06:03.788
Who are they?

06:03.947 --> 06:06.291
Did they find Lobos?

06:08.118 --> 06:10.166
Tim, how many favors
have I done for you?

06:10.328 --> 06:12.171
You owe me.

06:12.330 --> 06:15.209
Office of Professional Responsibility.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.127
Shit.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.662
You'll have
the total amount for the buy-in

06:47.824 --> 06:49.576
wired to you
by the end of the day today.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.370
I'd be lying if I said
that your ability

06:51.536 --> 06:54.005
to scrape together the cash
so quickly wasn't a factor

06:54.164 --> 06:55.884
in my father's decision
to partner with you.

06:56.041 --> 06:59.081
I've sacrificed way too much, Karen,
to let some little money get in the way.

06:59.106 --> 07:01.450
Cheers.

07:03.173 --> 07:05.392
And I got a feeling
I'll make it back in record time.

07:05.550 --> 07:07.678
I bet you he won't be
making copies

07:07.844 --> 07:09.892
for much longer
once this deal goes through.

07:10.055 --> 07:11.932
- You think so?
- Have you seen you?

07:12.098 --> 07:14.567
We can't afford to just have you
pushing papers in the back.

07:14.726 --> 07:15.943
Well, thank you, Karen.

07:16.102 --> 07:17.582
That's definitely
my vision for Andre.

07:17.607 --> 07:20.076
- Kid's got a lot of potential.
- I got to run.

07:21.024 --> 07:23.305
I'll see you later on for
the final walk-through with Dad?

07:23.443 --> 07:25.195
Wouldn't miss it for the world.

07:41.378 --> 07:43.881
You have our full support in
your breach-of-duty investigation

07:44.047 --> 07:45.799
<i>of my Lobos task force, NU.</i>

07:45.966 --> 07:49.220
If someone leaked details accidentally,
I guarantee they're gonna cooperate.

07:49.386 --> 07:51.559
We have no reason to believe

07:51.721 --> 07:54.224
the Lobos escape
was a breach of duty.

07:54.391 --> 07:56.894
This was a purposeful
leak of information.

07:57.060 --> 08:00.405
We're here to investigate
criminal conspiracy.

08:00.563 --> 08:02.440
Mr. Sandoval,
if you'll excuse us.

08:02.607 --> 08:03.967
We'll be interviewing you shortly.

08:04.901 --> 08:07.074
I thought I'd be part of
the debrief of the task force.

08:07.237 --> 08:09.490
Everybody on the task force
is on the suspect list.

08:09.656 --> 08:12.876
Only way to get off that list
is to talk with us.

08:13.034 --> 08:14.752
It's not personal.

08:14.911 --> 08:16.913
Mike, go on ahead.
I'll take it from here.

08:27.924 --> 08:31.349
Lobos escaped, and he got himself
killed by a traitor in his own ranks.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.933
I admit someone on our side
had to be sloppy,

08:34.097 --> 08:35.440
but it's a far cry from intent.

08:35.597 --> 08:37.600
It's breach of duty at best.

08:37.767 --> 08:39.360
No, actually,

08:39.519 --> 08:41.692
it's criminal conspiracy
to commit murder.

08:41.855 --> 08:44.028
Lobos is dead,
and the cell phone

08:44.190 --> 08:46.864
found on his person
links us to this office.

08:47.027 --> 08:50.782
Lobos's burner cell received
its very first and very last call

08:50.947 --> 08:53.120
just moments before
his estimated time of death

08:53.283 --> 08:55.627
from a number ending in 6453.

08:55.785 --> 08:57.378
We pulled the records
for that phone.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.790
Turns out that that number
made multiple calls

08:59.956 --> 09:02.175
to only one other number
ending in 0148.

09:02.333 --> 09:05.963
These are prepaid burner cells,
but we're able to follow the call pattern.

09:06.129 --> 09:09.133
The 0148 number
pinged a cell tower near Teterboro.

09:09.299 --> 09:12.894
Can you guess which tower
pinged the 6453 number?

09:13.053 --> 09:15.476
The one right on top of
this building.

09:15.638 --> 09:17.356
Shit.

09:17.515 --> 09:18.983
My thoughts exactly.

09:19.142 --> 09:22.316
Someone in this building
was involved with the Lobos escape,

09:22.479 --> 09:26.325
and the only people with relevant
information were on this task force.

09:26.483 --> 09:29.157
One of your people is dirty, David,

09:29.319 --> 09:31.287
and I'm gonna find out which one.

09:32.322 --> 09:34.482
We get a new connect,
and now fucking Ghost is back in?

09:34.532 --> 09:36.500
What's that mean for me?

09:36.659 --> 09:38.206
It means you still got a job.

09:38.369 --> 09:40.121
Give me a fucking break, J.

09:41.498 --> 09:43.717
It's been a minute, man.

09:43.875 --> 09:45.673
Yeah, I wonder why.

09:45.835 --> 09:47.678
Look, man, I was just doing
what I had to do.

09:49.631 --> 09:52.510
All right, playboy.

09:55.845 --> 09:57.438
Julito.

09:58.348 --> 10:01.852
I ain't working with that
Tony the Tiger-lookin' motherfucker Dre.

10:02.018 --> 10:04.112
No Dre, got it.

10:04.270 --> 10:07.114
We can't talk here, Tommy.
Let's rap outside, all right?

10:11.027 --> 10:12.825
Stay here, J. We good.

10:19.202 --> 10:21.204
- What's up, man?
- It's good.

10:21.371 --> 10:23.920
- Ghost get you off the streets?
- Shit, hell, yeah, man.

10:24.082 --> 10:25.834
You back in, too?

10:28.711 --> 10:30.679
It's not looking like it.

10:33.341 --> 10:35.093
So you take care of it?

10:39.139 --> 10:40.579
You never came back
to the warehouse.

10:41.766 --> 10:43.564
Guess you didn't need
any help with Angela?

10:43.726 --> 10:45.979
- I handled it.
- She still breathing?

10:46.146 --> 10:49.070
Tommy, I ain't under her roof,
which means I ain't under her radar.

10:49.232 --> 10:51.075
- It's over.
- So you dumped

10:51.234 --> 10:52.736
a female government agent.

10:52.902 --> 10:55.702
Why don't you give me a little warning
before I get arrested this time?

10:56.823 --> 10:59.076
Tommy, Angela's
not coming after us, man.

10:59.242 --> 11:01.916
- The Lobos task force is over.
- Yeah, till they find the body,

11:02.078 --> 11:05.238
but we'll probably be chunks in Milan's
shit by then, so it don't matter anyway.

11:05.263 --> 11:07.258
Would you please
check your attitude, man?

11:07.417 --> 11:09.590
I'm serious.
You're gonna get us both killed.

11:15.091 --> 11:16.513
Tommy, Milan should've killed us.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.556
We don't even know
what game we're playing here.

11:18.719 --> 11:20.919
We got to stick together,
until we know how to play him,

11:20.971 --> 11:23.312
or until he slips up,
then we get him.

11:23.474 --> 11:25.351
What if he don't slip up?

11:25.518 --> 11:28.067
Everyone does eventually.

11:34.110 --> 11:36.270
Hey, you need me to go along
for whatever's going down?

11:36.321 --> 11:38.870
No, you good, Andre.
Just hang back, all right?

11:39.699 --> 11:42.043
Fuck.

11:46.372 --> 11:47.965
Inside.

11:48.124 --> 11:49.842
Not him.

11:50.001 --> 11:52.299
- You good, T?
- Just go back to the spot.

11:52.462 --> 11:53.634
Check out the new product.

11:53.796 --> 11:55.890
I'll meet you there,
after all this bullshit.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.034
Tariq, come on!

12:18.196 --> 12:21.700
- Let's go.
- Oh, my God.

12:21.866 --> 12:24.244
All Dr. Hong wants to do
is talk about my feelings.

12:24.410 --> 12:25.753
- It's so stupid.
- I know, baby.

12:25.912 --> 12:27.712
But you only have
two more sessions to finish,

12:27.872 --> 12:29.340
and you can go back to school.

12:29.499 --> 12:31.379
Don't you want to see
your father at Career Day?

12:31.404 --> 12:33.827
No. And you hate him, too,
so why do you even care?

12:37.465 --> 12:39.843
'Riq, come here.

12:40.760 --> 12:44.014
- I do not hate your father.
- Yes, you do.

12:44.180 --> 12:46.274
God, you're such a fucking liar,
just like him.

12:51.020 --> 12:55.526
Boy, you better get your black ass
to your room right now!

12:55.692 --> 12:57.444
You lost your goddamn mind!

13:07.203 --> 13:10.707
Ghost, I need you to call me back
as soon as you get this message.

13:10.873 --> 13:12.753
You better come over here
and talk to your child

13:12.875 --> 13:14.252
before I kill him my damn self!

13:19.215 --> 13:22.594
You've been interviewed
by the OPR before, haven't you?

13:22.760 --> 13:25.889
When Lobos's California distro
was murdered in your custody,

13:26.055 --> 13:28.399
along with two marshals?

13:28.558 --> 13:31.812
I was investigated,
as a formality, and cleared.

13:31.978 --> 13:33.571
But I was never a suspect.

13:33.730 --> 13:35.949
There was no indication
I was involved.

13:36.107 --> 13:38.235
I had none of the markers of
being compromised...

13:38.401 --> 13:40.321
No sudden increase in wealth,
points of pressure,

13:40.403 --> 13:42.576
or connections to criminals
or criminal activity.

13:42.739 --> 13:44.582
So you know nothing
about the cell phone

13:44.741 --> 13:46.789
found at the Lobos murder scene?

13:46.951 --> 13:49.170
No, I don't know about the phone.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.289
I don't know anything
about what happened to Lobos

13:51.414 --> 13:52.666
after the caravan was hit.

13:52.832 --> 13:55.756
Let's talk about that,
the logistics of Lobos's transfer.

13:55.918 --> 13:59.138
It says here that after Lobos agreed
to flip on the Jimenez,

13:59.297 --> 14:01.971
you got the official request
from D.C.

14:02.133 --> 14:05.433
I got the request,
but Valdes filed the paperwork.

14:05.595 --> 14:08.098
Yes, Mike told me
about the transfer request

14:08.264 --> 14:10.312
and asked me to file the paperwork.

14:10.475 --> 14:13.604
It's only your signature
on the documents.

14:13.770 --> 14:17.195
Did you keep a copy of
the transfer order for your own records,

14:17.357 --> 14:18.950
take it home maybe?

14:19.108 --> 14:23.033
I filed the paperwork
and left all copies here, ma'am.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.619
We were under strict orders
that all documents

14:25.782 --> 14:28.126
associated with the John Doe
prosecution of Lobos

14:28.284 --> 14:29.627
were not to leave the building.

14:29.786 --> 14:32.630
But you're not a big fan
of the rules, right, Valdes?

14:32.789 --> 14:36.794
I mean, using a minor to identify
a dangerous narcotics suspect?

14:36.959 --> 14:39.803
Turning a sex offender
into a criminal informant?

14:39.962 --> 14:42.215
You break the rules all the time.

14:42.382 --> 14:45.727
Where were you when you learned
that Lobos had escaped?

14:46.719 --> 14:49.347
I was in the van with Felipe Lobos
when we were ambushed.

14:49.514 --> 14:52.313
- You survived a shot to the chest.
- Two, Agent Donovan.

14:52.475 --> 14:54.569
Your vest protected you,
but I've been thinking,

14:54.727 --> 14:56.207
why didn't they shoot you
in the head?

14:56.232 --> 15:00.150
You claimed in your report that
the Lobos escape was an inside job.

15:00.316 --> 15:02.676
- There's not a doubt in my mind.
- What makes you say that?

15:02.701 --> 15:05.826
Agent Knox reported that Lobos
anticipated the hit on the caravan

15:05.988 --> 15:09.162
and that the men that helped him to escape
knew where to find the GPS tracker.

15:09.325 --> 15:11.925
Agent Donovan, you weren't originally
assigned to this task force.

15:11.994 --> 15:13.712
Why were you brought on the case?

15:13.871 --> 15:16.499
Did you request
more involvement with Lobos?

15:16.666 --> 15:18.168
No, Agent Donovan,

15:18.334 --> 15:22.259
there was an incident between
Knox and an AUSA on the task force.

15:22.422 --> 15:25.050
Angela and Greg
had a romantic relationship.

15:25.216 --> 15:27.514
They thought it was a secret,
but everybody knew.

15:27.677 --> 15:30.351
It ended.
I don't know, I don't care.

15:30.513 --> 15:32.857
I can't really speak to
their interpersonal problems.

15:33.015 --> 15:35.518
Probably because
you're too distracted

15:35.685 --> 15:37.608
with interpersonal
problems of your own.

15:39.814 --> 15:42.613
I-I-I never bring my issues
to the office.

15:42.775 --> 15:46.496
I'm not sure there's enough space
in here for what you're into.

15:49.574 --> 15:51.918
W... You... you guys...

15:52.076 --> 15:54.374
- you keep a file on that?
- We keep a file on everything.

15:54.537 --> 15:58.383
Tell us what happened
with Knox and Valdes, Mr. Saxe.

15:59.876 --> 16:01.924
All I know is Greg was suspended

16:02.086 --> 16:04.054
because Angela accused him
of stalking her.

16:04.213 --> 16:06.716
Then one day Greg's
waltzing in with Vibora Ruiz,

16:06.883 --> 16:09.227
and he's back on the task force
like he never left.

16:09.385 --> 16:12.104
Valdes had no objection
to Knox's return to the task force,

16:12.263 --> 16:15.062
and Ruiz was a valuable asset
for the Lobos case.

16:15.224 --> 16:17.264
He would only work with Agent Knox.
I had no choice.

16:17.289 --> 16:20.063
Did you ever speak of
the John Doe prosecution

16:20.229 --> 16:22.732
of Felipe Lobos
outside of the task force?

16:22.899 --> 16:24.446
- No.
- No.

16:24.609 --> 16:25.861
- No.
- No.

16:27.737 --> 16:30.581
I was in communication

16:30.740 --> 16:32.458
with Agent Knox
while he was suspended,

16:32.617 --> 16:34.995
but I never told him
about our John Doe prosecution.

16:35.161 --> 16:38.756
I follow protocol.
I was being a nice guy.

16:38.915 --> 16:41.759
Knox was a little fucked up,
over-focused on the case.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.755
On Valdes, really,
but it was on the case.

16:44.921 --> 16:48.516
Can you tell me why you were
so eager to obtain Mr. Ruiz,

16:48.674 --> 16:52.474
- even though you were suspended?
- I wanted justice.

16:52.637 --> 16:54.105
- For?
- Myself.

16:54.263 --> 16:55.765
I had a theory,

16:55.932 --> 16:59.012
and Ruiz could prove that I was right
and that I didn't deserve my suspension.

16:59.037 --> 17:03.106
So you weren't following
AUSA Valdes during your suspension?

17:03.272 --> 17:04.819
Oh, no, I was.

17:04.982 --> 17:07.155
I was following her,
but only because I thought

17:07.318 --> 17:09.945
she was involved with our suspects.

17:10.112 --> 17:13.286
I mean, how the hell else did she have
the right address for the Lobos meet?

17:13.449 --> 17:15.827
- An anonymous tip.
- You initially reported

17:15.992 --> 17:18.165
that you had an unofficial tail
placed on him.

17:18.329 --> 17:21.299
An anonymous tip
would've seemed unreliable.

17:21.457 --> 17:24.631
I needed to convince Mike to move
the team in a short amount of time.

17:24.794 --> 17:26.296
- So you lied.
- I lied.

17:26.462 --> 17:28.715
- We got our guy.
- Back to your rules problem again.

17:28.881 --> 17:31.134
Shouldn't we be talking about
how to find Lobos?

17:31.300 --> 17:34.144
- If we could extradite him...
- We know where Lobos is.

17:34.303 --> 17:36.806
That's not the problem.

17:38.808 --> 17:41.186
Felipe Lobos is dead.

17:41.352 --> 17:43.525
- Oh, fuck.
- Fuck.

17:43.688 --> 17:46.316
Lobos had many enemies.
I'm not at all surprised.

17:46.482 --> 17:48.655
- He was killed.
- Murdered, yes.

17:48.818 --> 17:51.537
- You seem upset.
- Of course I'm upset.

17:51.696 --> 17:55.417
I had hopes for the future...

17:55.575 --> 17:57.703
that we would find Lobos and try him,

17:57.868 --> 18:00.337
but now that's completely fucked.

18:07.503 --> 18:09.050
Can I have a break?

18:21.684 --> 18:24.187
You sold drugs,
saved your money,

18:24.353 --> 18:26.822
started a family,
moved to Manhattan,

18:26.981 --> 18:29.200
and made investments.

18:29.358 --> 18:31.861
This is the American dream, no?

18:32.028 --> 18:34.076
Then you took from me,

18:34.238 --> 18:36.866
and you killed the head of my network,
and now you are here,

18:37.033 --> 18:39.161
enslaved to me.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.714
Yeah, Chefe.

18:43.873 --> 18:46.001
Motherfucker Googled
the shit out of you.

18:47.043 --> 18:48.966
Yo, "This ls Your Life,"
you gonna do me next?

18:49.128 --> 18:51.631
Duse, you will distribute
to your high-end clientele

18:51.797 --> 18:54.550
as well as oversee
your deputy's distribution

18:54.717 --> 18:56.560
to Shin, Cristobal, and Poncho.

18:56.719 --> 18:59.222
- I look like a deputy to you?
- Yes, Chefe.

18:59.388 --> 19:01.390
- Any questions?
- I got one.

19:01.557 --> 19:03.559
You really eat people?

19:06.896 --> 19:09.274
You gonna answer my question?

19:09.440 --> 19:12.319
Vladimir said you were simple,

19:12.485 --> 19:14.487
but he liked you anyway.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.577
I cannot comprehend why.

19:38.260 --> 19:40.433
Used to having the bathroom
to yourself?

19:40.596 --> 19:43.099
I guess so.
Never thought about it.

19:43.265 --> 19:46.815
I had my own bathroom when I worked
criminal at Georgia Northern.

19:46.977 --> 19:48.854
The ladies' was my refuge

19:49.021 --> 19:51.115
from all the eye-fucking
and ass-grabbing.

19:52.066 --> 19:54.160
It's not so bad here.

19:54.777 --> 19:56.575
Believe it or not...

19:57.530 --> 19:59.282
I kind of miss those days.

19:59.448 --> 20:02.292
You still got that
certain set of skills

20:02.451 --> 20:05.125
that makes them
listen to you when you talk.

20:05.287 --> 20:07.540
Turn 40,

20:07.707 --> 20:09.960
they turn into Helen Keller.

20:12.461 --> 20:13.883
A word of advice...

20:14.046 --> 20:16.674
take that ass to General Crimes
and make a case.

20:16.841 --> 20:19.594
Get a bench before
you turn into a pumpkin.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.143
I was thinking...

20:23.305 --> 20:25.148
the Jimenez tried to kill Lobos

20:25.307 --> 20:27.856
before when he was
in lockdown but failed.

20:29.145 --> 20:31.318
Do you think they finally
finished the task?

20:31.480 --> 20:33.824
Lobos's murder investigation

20:33.983 --> 20:35.485
is not my problem.

20:35.651 --> 20:37.073
And it's not yours either,

20:37.236 --> 20:39.159
but you'll get your answer
soon enough.

20:39.321 --> 20:42.450
Eastern District's been assigned
to figure out who pulled the trigger.

20:42.616 --> 20:44.243
And when they do,

20:44.410 --> 20:46.833
it's gonna lead them
right back here.

21:01.510 --> 21:03.512
So how the fuck he know
about this place?

21:03.679 --> 21:05.522
I know about everything.

21:06.724 --> 21:09.318
What the motherfuck is this?

21:11.187 --> 21:15.158
There you will find the product
for your primeras as we discussed.

21:15.858 --> 21:17.531
No more Father Callahan.

21:17.693 --> 21:18.694
He runs guns for the...

21:20.362 --> 21:21.784
Fuck the guns.

21:21.947 --> 21:26.043
His kids move a shit-ton of product,
undetected on account of their uniforms.

21:26.202 --> 21:28.125
Getting rid of Callahan
is bad for business.

21:31.999 --> 21:33.592
You're right, Tommy.

21:33.751 --> 21:35.298
This is business.

21:35.461 --> 21:37.384
Do not fire Callahan.

21:37.880 --> 21:39.223
Kill him.

21:41.550 --> 21:44.224
I ain't gonna kill the motherfucker
just 'cause you say so.

21:44.386 --> 21:45.666
We also have your product, Duse.

21:45.721 --> 21:47.769
I will require you to sell it
in your nightclubs.

21:47.932 --> 21:49.855
Surely there's another way
to punish him.

21:55.231 --> 21:58.235
What I'm saying is I can push
just as much product on the street,

21:58.400 --> 22:00.528
with fewer consequences.

22:22.466 --> 22:25.310
He did not follow my instructions.

22:25.469 --> 22:27.517
I will require a cashier's check

22:27.680 --> 22:31.560
made out to my security company
for the full cost of the product...

22:33.102 --> 22:35.230
by the end of the day.

22:36.063 --> 22:38.942
Chefe, you got to let us
pay you double next delivery.

22:39.108 --> 22:40.530
All of our clean money's tied up.

22:41.443 --> 22:43.537
Karen Bassett will wait, right, James?

22:45.364 --> 22:47.287
Get your men to work.

22:58.752 --> 23:00.675
He knows everything
about our business.

23:00.838 --> 23:03.078
He's forcing us to run it
instead of just taking it, man.

23:03.103 --> 23:05.105
To what end?

23:05.801 --> 23:07.394
So he don't have to do it.

23:07.553 --> 23:09.976
You heard him. We're his slaves.

23:10.139 --> 23:12.358
Listen, Tommy,
all my clean money's tied up.

23:12.516 --> 23:14.393
You got enough to float us?

23:15.311 --> 23:17.484
Nah, but you can have my share.

23:17.646 --> 23:20.240
I ain't paying up front
for an untested product.

23:20.399 --> 23:22.367
Milan will have to deal.

23:22.526 --> 23:25.655
Tommy, a man like that
doesn't fucking deal.

23:25.821 --> 23:28.540
You see what he just did
to his boy?

23:28.699 --> 23:31.999
Once upon a time, you were the one
warning me not to cross him.

23:32.161 --> 23:33.641
Now all of a sudden,
you all about it?

23:33.746 --> 23:36.875
- What the fuck is up with you?
- What the fuck is up with you,

23:37.041 --> 23:39.794
rolling over like a little bitch?
You really gonna deal in your club?

23:41.337 --> 23:43.681
All I'm saying is, for now,
we got to do what he says.

23:43.839 --> 23:46.342
We wet Callahan, we go to the bank,
we pay the motherfucker,

23:46.508 --> 23:49.603
then we sit back, and we wait to see
what our next move is gonna be.

23:49.762 --> 23:52.106
Look, man,
I can't get out of this shit alone.

23:53.307 --> 23:55.776
I don't care what the Serbian
Hannibal Lecter says, Ghost,

23:55.935 --> 23:58.358
you ain't my fucking boss.

23:59.021 --> 24:00.773
I've been running things
since you left.

24:00.940 --> 24:03.193
I'll handle this my own way.

24:11.533 --> 24:13.911
First the gun, now this.

24:14.870 --> 24:16.588
He's just getting worse, Ghost.

24:16.747 --> 24:19.421
If he'll raise a hand to me,
the worst is yet to come.

24:19.583 --> 24:22.211
Okay, Tasha, as soon as the boy
gets back from therapy,

24:22.378 --> 24:23.938
I'll talk to him, all right?
I'll get him straight.

24:23.963 --> 24:26.603
Yeah, well, good thing, 'cause
you're the one that got him crooked.

24:26.628 --> 24:29.427
You know, he's still torn up
over the Knicks game you took away.

24:29.593 --> 24:31.266
I told you, something came up.

24:31.428 --> 24:33.021
Something more important
than your son?

24:34.807 --> 24:37.481
I know you ain't gonna tell me
what it was.

24:37.643 --> 24:39.566
Do you even know
how to tell the truth anymore?

24:42.189 --> 24:44.487
Okay, Tasha. You want the truth?

24:44.650 --> 24:46.243
Please.

24:46.402 --> 24:48.780
Here it is. I need your help.

24:48.946 --> 24:50.744
I got the Karen Bassett contract.

24:50.906 --> 24:52.283
The problem is,
I'm short on money.

24:52.449 --> 24:55.449
Did you not just brag to me about having
the cash when we were at her hotel?

24:55.474 --> 24:57.630
- What happened?
- Some unexpected bills.

24:57.788 --> 25:00.257
So, look, I just need a short-term loan

25:00.416 --> 25:02.339
from the IRA and the kids' trust,

25:02.501 --> 25:05.501
but I can't do it until I get your
permission since you're the co-signatory.

25:05.526 --> 25:06.092
- No.
- What?

25:06.255 --> 25:07.757
- I'm not doing it.
- Look, Tasha,

25:07.923 --> 25:09.846
you know I will have it
back to you right away.

25:10.009 --> 25:12.933
Tasha, I would not be standing here
in front of you pleading

25:13.095 --> 25:15.018
if I had another option.

25:17.599 --> 25:19.772
Seems to me
you got another option.

25:19.935 --> 25:22.529
Shouldn't you be asking
that other woman for help?

25:22.688 --> 25:24.235
All that lawyer money she got?

25:27.860 --> 25:30.488
I can't...
I can't ask Angela, okay?

25:30.654 --> 25:32.452
We-we're no longer together.

25:32.614 --> 25:33.831
I ended it.

25:33.991 --> 25:36.210
I don't want to get into it right now.
I'm asking you.

25:36.368 --> 25:37.540
I need the money.

25:39.288 --> 25:41.882
- The tax penalties will be ridiculous.
- No, 'cause we...

25:42.041 --> 25:43.964
The club shit is speculative.

25:44.126 --> 25:45.844
And I know you, Ghost.

25:46.003 --> 25:48.802
Things go south with the clubs,
you're gonna put all the Lobos cash

25:48.964 --> 25:50.807
right into them,
and the kids take a hit.

25:50.966 --> 25:52.609
You'll forget all about
putting the money back.

25:52.634 --> 25:54.352
Tasha, I would never steal
from the kids.

25:54.511 --> 25:56.479
- Those are our kids, all right?
- I'm sorry.

25:56.638 --> 25:58.982
I'm not betting their future on yours.

25:59.141 --> 26:01.360
Find another way.

26:01.518 --> 26:03.566
Tariq will be back this afternoon.

26:16.658 --> 26:19.582
Oh, fuck, man!

26:22.101 --> 26:24.141
- You lied to me.
- What the fuck you talking about?

26:24.166 --> 26:26.393
You said Ghost was out
and not fucking with Tommy no more.

26:26.418 --> 26:28.312
What was that I saw out front
this morning, then?

26:28.337 --> 26:31.297
Yo, I just found out my own self, man.
I swear to God, I'm not playing you.

26:31.322 --> 26:33.183
You know this nigga,
he always keeps a secret.

26:33.342 --> 26:36.812
I'm out in the cold just like you.
Swear to God.

26:39.014 --> 26:42.735
It's time for you to get inside,
find out what it is he's up to, fast.

26:42.893 --> 26:44.853
I don't know how much longer
I can lay in the cut.

26:45.687 --> 26:47.327
You need to get
the fuck out of here, man.

26:47.439 --> 26:49.199
There's all kind of eyes watching,
all right?

26:49.224 --> 26:50.784
I'll call you.

26:50.943 --> 26:52.695
I'll call you.

27:02.204 --> 27:05.629
- What do you think, Daddy?
- I think the "Stern-vanquisher"

27:05.791 --> 27:09.045
- is going to make a fantastic partner.
- Thank you, sir.

27:09.211 --> 27:11.760
Hopefully I can parlay
that high esteem into a favor.

27:11.922 --> 27:13.640
What is it, James?

27:13.799 --> 27:16.723
I had a misunderstanding
with another associate, Karen,

27:16.885 --> 27:18.887
so, unfortunately,
I'm gonna need a few more weeks

27:19.054 --> 27:20.854
to come up with the money,
but not a big deal.

27:20.973 --> 27:24.568
I will then bring you a wheelbarrow
full of cash, plus the penalty, sir.

27:24.726 --> 27:26.526
What happened?
You had the money this morning.

27:26.551 --> 27:27.946
An unforeseeable reversal.

27:28.105 --> 27:31.075
James, my stockholders
are expecting to hear certain numbers

27:31.233 --> 27:33.327
on my earnings report
at the end of the quarter,

27:33.485 --> 27:36.455
and I can't deliver it
without your cash investment.

27:36.613 --> 27:39.332
It's clear to me you're in
no financial shape to join our group.

27:40.576 --> 27:42.920
He's got till the end of the day, Dad.

27:49.168 --> 27:51.262
I know this means
a lot to you, James.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.172
Get the money.

27:58.760 --> 28:00.808
What is this for?

28:00.971 --> 28:03.599
It's for... I'll tell you later.

28:03.765 --> 28:05.358
Thank you, T.

28:10.606 --> 28:12.358
Tommy, Why'd you do that to Holly?

28:14.443 --> 28:16.195
Ghost told me what happened.

28:17.446 --> 28:19.289
He did?

28:19.448 --> 28:21.792
I thought you would've
done better than that.

28:21.950 --> 28:24.078
I feel responsible.
I told her to tell you.

28:25.621 --> 28:27.999
You knew?

28:28.165 --> 28:30.839
I thought you would've been cool,
but you flipped out, right?

28:31.001 --> 28:33.504
Now she's out there, alone,
pregnant with your child.

28:33.670 --> 28:36.640
- Pregnant.
- Probably already halfway to Ohio by now.

28:36.798 --> 28:39.392
Are you gonna at least try
to find her?

28:40.260 --> 28:43.480
Listen, if you wait too long,
it'll probably be too late.

28:43.639 --> 28:45.357
I got to get out of here.

28:45.515 --> 28:47.984
You gonna go find her?

28:49.645 --> 28:51.647
Yeah, maybe.
I got to deliver this.

28:51.813 --> 28:53.315
Tommy, are you okay?

28:53.482 --> 28:55.484
Call me, okay?

29:14.836 --> 29:17.680
You've accused Valdes of
interfering with the Lobos case

29:17.839 --> 29:21.639
to help St. Patrick
save his friend Egan from prison.

29:22.928 --> 29:28.025
But that argument doesn't
really apply to Lobos's escape.

29:28.183 --> 29:29.685
Egan's already in the clear.

29:29.851 --> 29:31.728
Right, but she's fucking
James St. Patrick.

29:31.895 --> 29:33.021
Maybe he wanted Lobos dead.

29:33.188 --> 29:35.236
Why would St. Patrick want that,
Agent Knox?

29:35.399 --> 29:38.528
We have no proof that St. Patrick
is directly involved with Lobos.

29:38.694 --> 29:41.072
And there's no law against
AUSA Valdes

29:41.238 --> 29:42.865
having a relationship with him.

29:43.031 --> 29:44.624
So she's just gonna get away with it.

29:44.783 --> 29:47.536
Valdes didn't break the law,
Agent Knox.

29:49.204 --> 29:51.206
She broke your heart.

29:51.373 --> 29:53.973
Isn't that why you wanted back
on the task force, to catch Valdes?

29:54.042 --> 29:57.091
And then when you couldn't,
maybe you snapped.

29:57.254 --> 29:59.632
Maybe you set up Lobos's murder,

29:59.798 --> 30:01.800
thinking you could
pin all this on her,

30:01.967 --> 30:03.810
get back at her
for ruining your career,

30:03.969 --> 30:06.313
for falling in love
with somebody else.

30:06.471 --> 30:09.395
You keep saying
there's an inside man.

30:09.558 --> 30:12.482
- Maybe it's you.
- That's ridiculous.

30:14.229 --> 30:16.482
Yeah, maybe...

30:17.232 --> 30:19.192
maybe Mike shouldn't have
let me back on the team.

30:19.276 --> 30:21.449
Maybe I was a little too intense.

30:21.611 --> 30:23.739
But that doesn't mean I'm wrong.

30:23.905 --> 30:26.829
Look into Angela.
You'll find the proof.

30:26.992 --> 30:28.835
She's involved.

30:57.856 --> 30:59.950
I want back in, Ghost.

31:00.108 --> 31:01.668
I know you're back in,
so don't deny it.

31:04.279 --> 31:06.498
I didn't want to bring you
into all of this.

31:11.787 --> 31:13.039
I wanted more for you, Andre.

31:13.205 --> 31:15.299
What about what I want for me?

31:28.804 --> 31:30.226
Let's take a walk.

31:45.070 --> 31:47.323
Look, I lied to you about
the La Arafia card, all right?

31:47.489 --> 31:49.583
I thought it was Lobos,
but it was actually Dean.

31:49.741 --> 31:52.085
- The security dude?
- Yeah, he's been posing as security

31:52.244 --> 31:54.747
this whole time, turns out to be
Vladimir's old connect, Milan.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.415
Hold on, wait, hold on.

31:57.332 --> 31:59.084
The nigga that eats people?

31:59.251 --> 32:01.754
Yeah, look, we robbed him.
He's pissed.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.093
He's forcing me and Tommy
to replace Vladimir.

32:04.256 --> 32:07.385
We got to come up with legit cash up
front, which is why I can't pay Karen.

32:07.551 --> 32:09.849
- So that's why you're back in.
- But I'm not staying.

32:10.470 --> 32:12.222
I need your help.

32:12.389 --> 32:15.229
If you help me get rid of Milan,
I'll give you half the street business.

32:15.350 --> 32:17.398
Along with Tommy.
I can't do it alone.

32:17.561 --> 32:19.689
- You in, or you not?
- Look, man, you know Tommy

32:19.855 --> 32:21.732
- not fucking with me, man.
- Fuck all that.

32:21.898 --> 32:24.026
You let me take care of that.

32:24.192 --> 32:25.364
Are you in?

32:28.780 --> 32:30.578
What's our next move, man?

32:30.740 --> 32:33.710
I need you to make an anonymous tip
about a missing person,

32:33.869 --> 32:35.963
Tatiana Boriskaya.

32:36.121 --> 32:38.499
I'll get the cops to handle the rest.

32:41.460 --> 32:43.053
You're right.

32:43.211 --> 32:46.251
You're the only one on your task force
who has none of the markers of a mole.

32:46.276 --> 32:47.599
So why am I still sitting here?

32:47.757 --> 32:51.387
All day I've been racking my brain
with that very question.

32:51.553 --> 32:53.753
I think I've come up with a reason.
You want to hear it?

32:55.724 --> 33:00.104
Whoever helped escape Lobos
had a history with him.

33:00.270 --> 33:03.490
Did you know that
you have worked the Lobos case

33:03.648 --> 33:07.903
longer than any AUSA or agent
in the entire Department of Justice?

33:08.069 --> 33:09.821
If I had a working relationship
with Lobos,

33:09.988 --> 33:12.992
wouldn't that mean I'd want
to see him escaped and alive?

33:13.158 --> 33:16.412
In my experience,
familiarity breeds contempt.

33:16.578 --> 33:18.797
MJ, you're a lawyer.
I'm a lawyer.

33:18.955 --> 33:21.754
We're trained to evaluate risk,
the worst-case scenario.

33:21.917 --> 33:24.420
If I planned to have Lobos killed
and it went wrong,

33:24.586 --> 33:26.714
how long would I survive?

33:28.173 --> 33:29.595
How long would my family survive?

33:29.758 --> 33:32.432
Someone on this task force
took exactly that risk.

33:32.594 --> 33:35.689
- If not you, who?
- You must have a thought, an instinct.

33:37.265 --> 33:39.438
I'm not going to throw
my people under the bus.

33:44.105 --> 33:45.778
You want to be
on this side of the table?

33:45.941 --> 33:48.285
You want to get cleared?
Help us.

33:48.443 --> 33:51.663
I'll see that Main Justice
hears about your cooperation.

33:51.821 --> 33:54.540
Agent Knox
thinks Valdes is involved.

33:54.699 --> 33:56.701
He's got an axe to grind with her,
but you don't.

33:57.744 --> 33:59.417
Could he be right?

34:10.549 --> 34:14.304
How much do you know about Angela's
relationship with James St. Patrick?

34:20.641 --> 34:22.268
Angela?

34:29.734 --> 34:31.485
I just came to pick up some things.

34:31.652 --> 34:33.655
I was just packing them for you.

34:43.915 --> 34:46.009
You really fucked up.
You know that.

34:47.335 --> 34:49.588
Paz, your sister will soon see

34:49.754 --> 34:51.523
that I was just trying to
take care of her, all right?

34:51.547 --> 34:53.308
- I was trying to protect her.
- Protect her?

34:53.341 --> 34:55.184
Who teaches you men that bullshit?

34:55.342 --> 34:57.812
She loved you.
She would have done anything for you.

34:58.680 --> 34:59.681
Yeah, I know.

34:59.848 --> 35:01.448
You know she's always
been the smart one,

35:01.614 --> 35:04.574
and now because of you, she's doubting
herself about everything, even work.

35:04.599 --> 35:07.364
She's being questioned there
as we speak over some fuck-up.

35:07.522 --> 35:10.867
They practically dragged her
out of here by her hair this morning.

35:11.026 --> 35:13.028
Look, Paz,
I ain't a bad man, all right?

35:13.194 --> 35:14.195
- I'm just...
- A man.

35:14.362 --> 35:15.864
You got enough pussy.

35:16.031 --> 35:18.033
You got bored. You moved on.

35:18.199 --> 35:20.452
I get it.

35:23.872 --> 35:25.624
Get out.

35:32.047 --> 35:35.722
If I ever catch you near my sister again,
I'll kill you with my bare hands.

35:52.150 --> 35:55.529
"I wish I were there, too.
Love you, Jamie."

35:56.488 --> 35:59.833
Agent Knox would kill
to read those texts.

36:00.867 --> 36:04.838
You know he thinks you helped
St. Patrick to escape Lobos.

36:04.996 --> 36:07.419
He also said the men
that attacked the transfer

36:07.582 --> 36:09.926
knew about Lobos's GPS tracker.

36:10.085 --> 36:12.087
I couldn't have told
anyone about that.

36:12.253 --> 36:14.534
I didn't know about the tracker
until after they were hit.

36:14.589 --> 36:16.637
- Can you prove you didn't know?
- No, but...

36:16.800 --> 36:19.849
Yeah, it's kind of hard
to prove a negative.

36:20.011 --> 36:22.013
But it's all right.

36:22.180 --> 36:25.434
I think Agent Knox
is dead wrong about you.

36:26.559 --> 36:29.483
- Thank you.
- I think St. Patrick used you,

36:29.646 --> 36:32.195
- just like he did before.
- I did not leak, lose,

36:32.357 --> 36:36.157
or transmit any information
regarding Lobos's trial or transfer.

36:36.319 --> 36:40.040
He put your career at risk
to help Egan walk.

36:40.198 --> 36:43.623
You forgave him, took him back,
and now Lobos is dead.

36:43.785 --> 36:46.664
You got duped again, sweetie.

36:46.830 --> 36:50.130
- Love will do that to you.
- This has nothing to do with love.

36:50.291 --> 36:52.293
It has everything to do with love.

36:54.546 --> 36:56.719
We are as strong as they are.

36:56.881 --> 37:00.181
Hell, stronger,
till we fall in love and lose focus.

37:00.343 --> 37:03.062
Then we fuck shit up,
and they know it.

37:03.221 --> 37:04.973
When St. Patrick looked at you,

37:05.140 --> 37:08.690
he didn't see a future judge,
future Attorney General.

37:08.852 --> 37:10.729
He saw a typical woman...

37:10.895 --> 37:12.317
a sucker.

37:16.651 --> 37:19.495
He's the sucker, not me.

37:21.281 --> 37:24.285
He didn't play me. I played him.

37:24.451 --> 37:26.499
I knew he was in touch with Egan,

37:26.661 --> 37:29.756
so I cloned his phone
while he slept in our hotel room.

37:29.914 --> 37:31.211
That's a federal offense.

37:31.374 --> 37:34.924
You're saying you slept with
St. Patrick to get Lobos?

37:35.086 --> 37:38.010
Lobos would've slipped
right through our fingers again

37:38.173 --> 37:39.766
if it weren't for me using

37:39.924 --> 37:43.349
my "special set of skills"
to track Egan.

37:43.511 --> 37:45.263
Agent Knox couldn't find Lobos,

37:45.430 --> 37:47.353
Mike was sure he had
the right location,

37:47.515 --> 37:49.734
and Saxe was just along for the ride.

37:49.893 --> 37:52.112
They got it wrong.
I got it right.

37:52.270 --> 37:55.194
Every action I've ever taken,
ethical or in the gray,

37:55.356 --> 37:57.950
has been to mount
Lobos's head on a wall,

37:58.109 --> 38:00.988
and I dare you to find
any evidence to the contrary.

38:03.198 --> 38:06.168
I'll have to admit,
I'm impressed.

38:08.119 --> 38:10.213
Thank you for
your cooperation, Angela.

38:10.371 --> 38:13.215
You're free to go.

38:23.468 --> 38:25.891
We need to talk
to James St. Patrick.

38:37.065 --> 38:38.157
Tommy?

38:38.316 --> 38:40.489
We didn't have a meeting
scheduled today, did we?

38:43.363 --> 38:46.958
This about that thing
you were worried about before?

38:47.826 --> 38:49.578
I found a way around it.

38:49.744 --> 38:52.418
See? Prayer works.

38:53.581 --> 38:56.334
My life was good...

38:57.418 --> 38:59.216
real good.

39:01.714 --> 39:04.217
And then everything got fucked up.

39:05.093 --> 39:08.097
All I wanted was for everything
to go back to the way it was.

39:08.263 --> 39:11.858
And I don't know if I prayed,
but I wished.

39:12.016 --> 39:14.064
And it came true...

39:15.061 --> 39:16.984
but not the way I wanted.

39:19.065 --> 39:21.193
I want to take it all back.

39:21.693 --> 39:24.133
I made a huge mistake,
and there's nothing I can do to fix it.

39:24.279 --> 39:26.953
We can't receive God's forgiveness

39:27.115 --> 39:28.583
unless we forgive ourselves.

39:31.202 --> 39:33.455
Why would I ever
want to forgive myself?

39:39.002 --> 39:42.222
My new connect don't want you
running guns for the Albanians no more.

39:42.380 --> 39:44.132
Those guns paid
for the soup kitchen.

39:44.299 --> 39:45.596
Then have a fucking bake sale.

39:45.758 --> 39:47.852
He's a crazy motherfucker,
and he's gonna kill you

39:48.011 --> 39:49.558
if you don't stop
running them guns.

39:49.721 --> 39:52.645
- Tommy, I can't just stop...
- Let me save your life, Father.

39:52.807 --> 39:55.481
Let me do this one good thing.

40:02.483 --> 40:03.905
Okay, no more guns.

40:58.289 --> 41:00.166
Gracias, Paz.

41:22.563 --> 41:23.564
Good evening.

41:23.731 --> 41:25.984
I'm calling on behalf
of Mr. St. Patrick.

41:32.490 --> 41:34.834
You live uptown.
This ain't uptown.

41:34.993 --> 41:37.473
I don't know why you think
you can keep showing up at my place.

41:37.498 --> 41:39.831
Were you with Jamie
at the Odette Hotel night before last?

41:39.998 --> 41:41.466
That's none of your business.

41:41.624 --> 41:43.501
If you are covering for him,

41:43.668 --> 41:47.298
you could be charged as an accomplice
in a conspiracy to commit murder.

41:47.463 --> 41:50.512
If you are found guilty,
you will lose your kids.

41:50.675 --> 41:53.770
You will lose your home.
You will lose everything.

41:53.928 --> 41:56.602
If you lie, I can't protect you.

41:56.764 --> 41:58.357
What's it gonna be?

42:08.443 --> 42:10.366
No, you're right.

42:10.528 --> 42:12.280
My husband did murder something

42:12.447 --> 42:14.449
when we were at the Odette
the other night.

42:14.615 --> 42:16.655
Shoot, who am I telling?
You know how he is with it.

42:16.680 --> 42:18.286
Nearly broke my damn back.

42:18.453 --> 42:21.127
That's not true.

42:21.289 --> 42:22.962
He wasn't there.

42:23.124 --> 42:24.876
He was killing Felipe Lobos,

42:25.043 --> 42:27.137
and don't pretend
you don't know who that is.

42:27.295 --> 42:30.549
Ghost and I fucked,
sweetie, all night.

42:30.715 --> 42:32.717
Matter of fact,
he's upstairs right now.

42:32.884 --> 42:34.807
You want to call him
and ask him for yourself?

42:38.222 --> 42:40.270
How could you take him back?

42:40.433 --> 42:42.310
I am his wife

42:42.477 --> 42:44.650
and the mother of his children,
I never lost him.

42:44.812 --> 42:48.157
So, whatever you think he did
the other night, he was with me.

42:48.316 --> 42:51.536
You were a midlife crisis, Angela.

42:51.694 --> 42:53.287
Crisis over.

43:04.499 --> 43:08.254
You used to live in
my apartment when you was young?

43:08.419 --> 43:10.421
A friend of mines did.
I was a block over.

43:12.006 --> 43:13.849
One second, sweetie.

43:14.008 --> 43:15.681
Take all the time you need.

43:20.473 --> 43:22.692
- What you got?
- Yo, G's crazy, dog.

43:22.850 --> 43:24.852
Got me calling in
anonymous tips and shit.

43:25.019 --> 43:26.271
Sounds familiar.

43:26.437 --> 43:28.197
So you know Vladimir's connect,
Milan, right?

43:28.364 --> 43:31.164
Yeah, the motherfucker took over
Ghost's business right under his nose.

43:31.189 --> 43:33.194
He needs my help
to get out from under.

43:33.361 --> 43:36.365
- I think he's scared, B.
- Yo, I seen him scared before.

43:36.531 --> 43:38.875
That ain't good for nobody.
Watch your back.

43:39.033 --> 43:40.535
Here we go.

43:42.370 --> 43:43.713
Hold on.

43:43.871 --> 43:46.215
I sure do appreciate you helping me.

43:53.881 --> 43:55.133
What are you doing to me?

43:55.299 --> 43:58.052
You no good piece of shit!

44:16.863 --> 44:18.160
I'm back.

44:18.322 --> 44:20.495
- Yo, what's the plan, man?
- It's already in motion.

44:20.658 --> 44:22.911
I'm gonna give this nigga
a history lesson,

44:23.077 --> 44:25.626
take him back in time.

44:36.424 --> 44:37.926
I wasn't even trying to hit her, Dad.

44:38.092 --> 44:39.892
I was just trying to stop her
from hitting me.

44:39.927 --> 44:42.021
Sit up.

44:44.432 --> 44:45.854
Listen to me.

44:46.017 --> 44:48.861
You do not have the right to put hands
on your mother, no matter what.

44:49.020 --> 44:51.523
You owe her an apology
for your behavior.

44:51.689 --> 44:53.657
Remember, we talked about it.

44:53.816 --> 44:55.113
Real men apologize.

44:55.276 --> 44:58.621
So you want me to apologize to her
like I did to your side bitch, right?

45:01.365 --> 45:04.539
What the fuck did you just say to me,
little motherfucker?

45:05.369 --> 45:06.962
Say it!

45:17.423 --> 45:19.642
'Riq. 'Riq!

45:30.186 --> 45:33.986
You made dinner plans
in my house without telling me?

45:45.451 --> 45:47.169
Tasha, you've already been introduced.

45:47.328 --> 45:50.548
James, you remember Tatiana.
She used to work at Truth.

45:50.706 --> 45:53.084
- Good to see you again, Tatiana.
- Yes.

45:53.251 --> 45:54.548
It's nice to see you, too.

45:54.710 --> 45:56.178
Let me help you with those.

45:56.337 --> 45:58.840
- Kids, dinner!
- Just the adults, Tash.

45:59.006 --> 46:00.486
No, I brought enough
for the children.

46:00.652 --> 46:01.904
Tatiana, you can come with me.

46:02.070 --> 46:03.515
Da.

46:03.678 --> 46:06.147
- You have a beautiful home.
- Thank you.

46:10.017 --> 46:12.019
- Why are you here?
- You were looking

46:12.186 --> 46:13.529
for Tatiana, were you not?

46:13.688 --> 46:16.282
I considered it an invitation
to bring her to dinner.

46:18.442 --> 46:22.117
It was very smart,
but I warned you.

46:22.280 --> 46:24.703
You must be Raina.

46:24.865 --> 46:26.742
I'm Dean.
I work for your father.

46:26.909 --> 46:28.629
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

46:28.654 --> 46:31.407
- Hey, Tariq. How you doing?
- Hi, Dean.

46:32.540 --> 46:34.133
Come on, children,
let's have a meal.

46:34.292 --> 46:38.672
I told James I wanted to meet
the family of my most important client.

46:40.256 --> 46:42.634
Family's important to him,

46:42.800 --> 46:46.521
and what's important to him
is important to me.

46:55.646 --> 46:56.738
James.

46:56.897 --> 46:58.490
James.

46:58.649 --> 47:00.401
Please, join us.

47:01.986 --> 47:04.034
Come on.

47:08.326 --> 47:11.125
And how you rolled ov...

47:11.287 --> 47:14.757
And that shit with the cinnamon
was so bad that you made.

47:35.770 --> 47:38.114
What's up, big boy?
You want a piece of this?

48:10.638 --> 48:13.232
You made the right choice,
paying me instead of Karen.

48:13.391 --> 48:17.066
But I still need you to find a way
to make the deal work.

48:17.228 --> 48:18.821
Karen called it off.
Deal's over.

48:18.979 --> 48:21.983
No, she likes you
and your three clubs.

48:22.149 --> 48:23.321
Find a way.

48:23.484 --> 48:26.658
I'm looking forward to having you
selling my product in her hotels.

48:26.821 --> 48:29.324
I'm not gonna sell drugs in my clubs.
It's too risky.

48:29.490 --> 48:31.834
I'm in your home,
with your family.

48:31.992 --> 48:33.460
That is risk.

48:38.833 --> 48:41.336
You have too many attachments.

48:41.502 --> 48:43.175
Attachments make you vulnerable,

48:43.337 --> 48:46.682
but you have made vulnerability
your strength.

48:51.512 --> 48:54.982
Think of them the next time
you want to betray me.

49:01.021 --> 49:03.319
He really thought I was dead.

49:06.360 --> 49:08.988
You have everything to lose, Duse.

49:12.116 --> 49:13.868
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure to meet you.

49:14.034 --> 49:16.002
- Take care.
- Thank you.

49:20.791 --> 49:22.839
What the fuck is going on, Ghost?

49:30.384 --> 49:32.227
What a fucking day.

49:32.386 --> 49:34.138
I mean, first your bitch comes by...

49:34.305 --> 49:35.306
- Angela came here?
- Yes.

49:35.473 --> 49:37.817
- I alibied you. She knows about Lobos.
- Shit.

49:37.975 --> 49:39.869
- Is that why you got us up here?
- No, I got us up here

49:39.894 --> 49:41.494
because fucking Milan
might be listening.

49:41.562 --> 49:43.564
- Milan? Who the fuck is Milan?
- Dean.

49:43.731 --> 49:45.779
Dean, who we just
had dinner with, Tasha.

49:45.941 --> 49:47.818
He might be the most
dangerous man I ever met.

49:47.985 --> 49:49.737
More dangerous than Kanan?

49:49.904 --> 49:51.872
Kanan was a street thug.

49:52.698 --> 49:54.120
Milan's a whole nother level.

50:15.095 --> 50:16.768
All of you, motherfuckers!
Come on!

50:16.931 --> 50:18.933
Kill him.

50:52.967 --> 50:54.469
Come on.

51:05.729 --> 51:08.323
So you're telling me that
he hovered over you this whole time

51:08.482 --> 51:09.859
just 'cause you killed Vladimir?

51:10.025 --> 51:12.244
Why didn't he just kill you?
What the fuck does he want?

51:12.403 --> 51:14.451
He wants me to suffer.

51:15.823 --> 51:19.418
- What are we gonna do?
- I think Milan made a mistake today.

51:20.244 --> 51:21.746
I'm gonna use it to get us out.

51:35.509 --> 51:37.853
Callahan called off the Albanians.

51:38.012 --> 51:41.607
A tolerable compromise,
but not what I asked.

51:42.308 --> 51:43.901
Vladimir was mistaken.

51:44.059 --> 51:46.107
You are not simple...

51:46.270 --> 51:47.692
but you are disobedient.

51:55.946 --> 51:57.698
Why do you want to die, Tommy?

51:59.366 --> 52:02.791
This is about the girl.

52:09.543 --> 52:11.261
Just fucking do it.

52:11.420 --> 52:15.050
I was wrong.
You have immense value.

52:15.215 --> 52:18.219
You have nothing to lose, Tommy.

52:18.927 --> 52:21.521
This is the best time to be alive.

52:46.747 --> 52:49.500
- Angela.
- I can't stay long.

52:49.667 --> 52:51.510
I might have been followed.

52:55.756 --> 52:58.680
Yeah, Paz told me that
they brought you in for questioning.

52:59.927 --> 53:02.271
You want to know if I gave you up.

53:02.429 --> 53:04.602
No, I want to know if you're okay.

53:06.684 --> 53:09.107
No, Jamie. I'm not okay.

53:10.020 --> 53:13.274
You killed Lobos,
and the DOJ thinks I participated.

53:13.440 --> 53:15.943
I need you to help me prove
that I'm innocent.

53:16.110 --> 53:19.284
- What are you talking about?
- Someone gave you information

53:19.446 --> 53:23.121
about Lobos's transfer so that
you could hit the caravan and kill him.

53:23.283 --> 53:25.877
I need to know who that was.

53:26.036 --> 53:29.711
I need to know who told you
where he would be.

53:32.376 --> 53:34.629
You used me.

53:37.297 --> 53:39.720
As soon as you got rid of him,
you got rid of me.

53:39.883 --> 53:41.726
Admit it.

53:46.473 --> 53:49.272
Get... Don't...
Get the fuck off me!

53:50.227 --> 53:53.027
- I'm not wearing a fucking wire.
- And how am I supposed to know that?

53:53.147 --> 53:56.321
Because if you go down,
I go down.

54:02.781 --> 54:04.658
I told you Lobos was alive.

54:04.825 --> 54:07.328
That makes me technically
part of the criminal conspiracy

54:07.494 --> 54:09.167
to commit this murder.

54:09.329 --> 54:11.172
I didn't tell you where he would be.

54:11.331 --> 54:13.049
I didn't know.

54:13.208 --> 54:16.382
That's why you have to help me
find who the real leak is.

54:16.545 --> 54:17.967
Who was it?

54:23.844 --> 54:26.063
I don't know
what you're talking about, Angela.

54:26.221 --> 54:28.849
Eastern District is
investigating the murder.

54:29.016 --> 54:31.690
If they figure out it was you,
it's gonna trace back to me.

54:39.610 --> 54:43.035
You're gonna let me get the death penalty
for something I didn't do.

54:44.448 --> 54:45.950
Angie, don't say that.

54:51.622 --> 54:54.296
You told me
you didn't love me anymore...

54:55.209 --> 54:57.303
but you lied.

54:57.461 --> 54:59.008
You never loved me.

55:01.507 --> 55:03.555
Angie, I do love you.
You know I love you.

55:03.717 --> 55:04.934
Don't.

55:05.093 --> 55:06.219
I'll fix this.

55:06.386 --> 55:08.730
The only way to fix this

55:08.889 --> 55:10.937
is to tell me who helped you.

55:11.099 --> 55:12.726
Who helped you, Jamie?

55:12.893 --> 55:14.816
Who told you
where Lobos would be?

55:18.565 --> 55:21.910
If whoever murdered Lobos
had inside information,

55:22.069 --> 55:24.413
I don't know
who he or she got it from.

55:25.489 --> 55:28.083
- Find out.
