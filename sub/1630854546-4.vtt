Additionally,</i>

03:08.542 --> 03:10.500
<i>recent core-drilling nearby</i>

03:10.625 --> 03:13.875
<i>has revealed a tunnel
some 103 feet deep</i>

03:14.042 --> 03:17.083
<i>that appears to be leading
toward the shaft, as well.</i>

03:17.208 --> 03:20.875
STEVE G.:
It does point just west
a few feet of the Garden Shaft.

03:22.375 --> 03:24.208
This is the Garden Shaft.

03:25.375 --> 03:29.000
So, Scott, you can tell the guys
why the shaft is of interest.

03:29.167 --> 03:30.583
SCOTT:
Well, one of the big reasons,

03:30.708 --> 03:32.958
we started a program
last year, water testing.

03:33.083 --> 03:35.958
As you can see, it's always
had a body of water in it,

03:36.083 --> 03:37.917
so we captured
some of that water,

03:38.042 --> 03:39.792
and it tested high for gold.

03:39.875 --> 03:42.000
-All right.
-SCOTT: So, it's definitely
worth exploring.

03:42.125 --> 03:46.167
RICK:
To me, the most interesting
thing about this shaft is

03:46.292 --> 03:49.458
that there very possibly
could be a tunnel at the bottom

03:49.542 --> 03:54.542
of that shaft, which still
might be available to enter.

03:54.667 --> 03:57.333
So, there's some
information down that hole,

03:57.500 --> 04:01.042
and we would like you
to provide access to it

04:01.167 --> 04:02.542
because we really think

04:02.708 --> 04:04.167
that there's gonna be
some answers there,

04:04.333 --> 04:06.708
but what we need
to understand is

04:06.875 --> 04:08.792
what's the plan here?
How do we approach this?

04:08.875 --> 04:10.333
How do you approach this?

04:10.417 --> 04:12.667
I think, right now,
we're-- we've got a bunch

04:12.792 --> 04:14.458

done up here to

04:14.583 --> 04:18.125
make a-a cap on top and-and
start from the top down,

04:18.208 --> 04:20.875
and we can start moving,
uh, some of the dirt

04:21.042 --> 04:22.792
and, uh, rehabbing the shaft,

04:22.917 --> 04:24.708

<i>and then install a new,

What's happening?

06:35.875 --> 06:39.125
We're down about 108, and when
we were just reviewing the core,

06:39.250 --> 06:41.125
just a normal logging,
we came across

06:41.250 --> 06:44.458
-a little chunk of wood,
just kind of unexpectedly.
-All right.

06:44.542 --> 06:46.625
RICK:
What was the depth of this?

06:46.750 --> 06:49.625
106.5 to 107. Right in there.

06:49.750 --> 06:53.292
It was in situ ground above,
and in situ ground below.

06:53.417 --> 06:55.625
At this point,
we're thinking another tunnel.

06:55.750 --> 06:56.833
(chuckles)

-RICK: There you go.
<i>-NARRATOR: Wood?</i>

06:58.500 --> 07:00.208
<i>Discovered in situ,</i>

<i>meaning in undisturbed ground,</i>

07:02.583 --> 07:06.208
<i>at a depth of
approximately 106 feet?</i>

07:06.333 --> 07:08.000
<i>If so, is it possible</i>

07:08.083 --> 07:10.833
<i>that the team has
encountered another section</i>

07:11.000 --> 07:13.167
<i>of the tunnel
they recently discovered,</i>

07:13.292 --> 07:16.958
<i>which may potentially lead
toward the Garden Shaft?</i>

07:17.042 --> 07:19.792
Almost every time we drill
anywhere near the Money Pit,

07:19.875 --> 07:21.917
<i>something pops up
that we didn't expect.</i>

07:22.042 --> 07:23.958
<i>And here it happened again,
part of the tunnel.</i>

07:24.042 --> 07:27.458
So, what it means
has to be figured out.

07:27.583 --> 07:30.667
Not only is it
at-at the depth, but

07:30.833 --> 07:33.625
we're in a fairly
under-investigated

07:33.750 --> 07:35.042
-area of the Money Pit.
-TERRY: Absolutely.

07:35.208 --> 07:37.333
And because of that,

07:37.417 --> 07:39.250
it's a prime candidate
for C-14 testing.

07:39.375 --> 07:40.375
-Oh, for sure.
-RICK: 100%

You know, to have

07:41.667 --> 07:43.000
a small chunk of wood

07:43.167 --> 07:44.167

-Absolutely.
-Yep.

<i>RICK:

very early activity, if not
original depositional work.

09:52.875 --> 09:55.333
Ian, you've been kind enough
to review the data,

09:55.500 --> 09:56.833
so what've you got?

09:56.958 --> 09:58.667
IAN:
So, I took a look at the LIDAR,

09:58.750 --> 10:02.208
and, in particular, Lot 30,
uh, jumped out, a feature there,

10:02.333 --> 10:03.958
and, uh, that

10:04.042 --> 10:05.750
I think Steve's gonna
take us to right now

10:05.875 --> 10:07.333
and see what people think.

10:07.417 --> 10:09.167
STEVE G.:
Sure.

10:09.292 --> 10:11.667
So, I brought this up first.

10:11.792 --> 10:14.917
So, this was supplied to
us from a LIDAR that they ran.

10:15.042 --> 10:18.167
Uh, you'll notice down here,
so it's right in here.

10:18.292 --> 10:21.833
There's the anomaly on Lot 30.

10:21.958 --> 10:24.667
It's about 100 by 150 feet.

10:24.750 --> 10:26.458
IAN:
Yeah, I'm pretty
excited by this.

10:26.583 --> 10:28.417
This is very geometric.

10:28.542 --> 10:31.167
It's not some natural feature.

10:31.292 --> 10:33.875
So, the question is, what is it?

10:41.958 --> 10:42.833
RICK:
That's incredibly interesting.

<i>RICK:
Every one of the experts
has said to us,</i>

11:09.375 --> 11:12.667
look for rectangular features

11:12.792 --> 11:14.750
does not do
right angles very well.

<i>Here, we have in front of us
a very rectangular feature.</i>

11:18.875 --> 11:22.000

that's a man-made construct.</i>

11:22.167 --> 11:25.750
<i>Anything man-made on this island
should be investigated.</i>

11:25.875 --> 11:27.917

what it may represent.

-Yeah.
-GARY: I like that area

11:33.750 --> 11:35.917
'cause it was kind of opposite

11:36.042 --> 11:39.708
where the wharf
would've been on Lot 32,

11:39.833 --> 11:43.583

of metal finds.

-Mm-hmm.
-STEVE G.: I'm gonna turn off

can see the image.

11:50.917 --> 11:52.625

Maybe this is

11:52.708 --> 11:54.667
the camp that the wharf
we're looking for

-Mm-hmm.

Two big areas,
where we've recovered artifacts,

and then just inland.

12:35.417 --> 12:36.917
STEVE G.:
Yeah.

12:37.042 --> 12:39.083
Makes sense that it could be
some kind of camp.

12:39.208 --> 12:40.792
Yeah. Connects.

12:40.875 --> 12:43.000
GARY:
We just got to find out
when they were

12:43.167 --> 12:44.333
using that area.

12:44.417 --> 12:45.625
Yeah.

12:45.708 --> 12:46.958
JACK:
If this feature's from

12:47.042 --> 12:49.208
the depositors
that were using a wharf,

12:49.333 --> 12:51.833
then I'd say we're the first
people that ever came across it.

12:51.958 --> 12:55.000
Surprises abound,
and this might be one of them.

12:55.125 --> 12:56.667
Yeah.

12:56.792 --> 12:57.708
RICK:
Everything that we talked about

12:57.833 --> 12:59.667
indicates that that area

12:59.833 --> 13:01.375
should have an explanation
for it, right?

13:01.500 --> 13:02.958
-Yeah.
-RICK: So, Laird,

13:03.083 --> 13:04.333
-not to put you on the spot...

13:07.708 --> 13:09.333
LAIRD:
I think we come in and do

13:09.500 --> 13:10.750
a small test trench by hand

13:10.875 --> 13:13.208
across one of the intersections.

It might be sharp.

a part of a fire grate.

16:37.042 --> 16:40.125
Whenever you see any pieces
of flat iron like this,

16:40.208 --> 16:42.375
and it's got those ridges.

16:42.542 --> 16:43.625
Yeah.

16:43.750 --> 16:45.292
I mean, this could be old, mate.

16:45.375 --> 16:48.250

some more pieces in there.

-or maybe a lot older.
-'Cause the wharf

17:54.542 --> 17:56.542

out there, is where we suspect.
-Yeah.

17:56.708 --> 17:58.333
Yup.

17:58.458 --> 18:00.167
The deeper we're digging
in this hole,

19:20.458 --> 19:23.208
I'm not sure if it's a tool
or a wharf pin.

19:23.333 --> 19:25.708
-To me, this reminds me
of a wharf pin.
-Oh.

19:25.833 --> 19:28.000
It's got that flat head.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.125
It looks like it was made

19:30.250 --> 19:32.208
to be driven into wood.

19:32.333 --> 19:35.375
So, a wharf pin, you mean,
to stick two pieces of

19:35.542 --> 19:37.458
-wharf wood together
and hold them? Yeah.
-Yeah, exactly.

19:37.542 --> 19:41.042
-I've seen how deep
you've been digging, mate.
-Definitely.

19:41.167 --> 19:43.125
That's been there
one very long time.

19:43.250 --> 19:45.500

20:05.042 --> 20:09.208
This is different kinds
of artifacts in one small area.

20:09.375 --> 20:10.958
Typically,
when you find things

20:11.083 --> 20:12.958
close together,
what-what do you think?

20:13.042 --> 20:14.500
-Are they related?
-Yeah.

20:14.667 --> 20:17.792
Normally,
I think activity, mate. Work.

20:17.875 --> 20:20.583
'Cause this could be
a-a loading and unloading zone.

20:20.708 --> 20:22.083
Yeah. Exactly.

20:22.208 --> 20:25.542
This could be, like,
a staging point, inland.

20:25.708 --> 20:28.625
Potentially, we could be
in an area, there could be

20:28.750 --> 20:30.333
a little encampment here.

20:30.458 --> 20:33.167

that tells me,

20:33.333 --> 20:35.667
it's a place where people

20:35.833 --> 20:37.333
would've spent some time.

20:37.500 --> 20:39.500
This might be the start

20:39.583 --> 20:42.333
of something really, really big.

20:42.417 --> 20:44.542
We just might be at the tip
of the iceberg.

20:44.708 --> 20:46.958
There could be so much more
deeper down,

TERRY:
We've got some
interesting stuff in an area

21:41.625 --> 21:42.833
that we've never found things.

21:42.958 --> 21:45.083
D-17,

21:45.208 --> 21:47.708
from 70 to 71.5,

21:47.833 --> 21:48.917
intersected some wood.

21:49.042 --> 21:50.667
Oh.

21:50.750 --> 21:52.708
-TERRY: Relatively shallow.
-CHARLES: Unusually shallow.

21:52.833 --> 21:54.833
It's odd that
it's at that depth.

21:54.917 --> 21:56.792
So, it's spread out
over quite a bit, and

21:56.917 --> 21:58.750
you can see there's more than
just those few little chunks.

21:58.875 --> 22:01.417
We clipped the edge of--
and broke up a beam,

22:01.542 --> 22:04.167
I would say.
It seemed to break into

22:04.333 --> 22:05.875
six blocks that
looked just about

22:06.000 --> 22:08.583
like what you have
in your hand there, Marty.

22:08.708 --> 22:11.208
MARTY:
That looks like an old,
broken edge.

22:11.333 --> 22:12.875
CRAIG:
Like they caught it, an end

22:13.042 --> 22:14.375
of a beam or something.

22:14.500 --> 22:17.208
TERRY:
This is 68 to 72.

22:17.333 --> 22:18.917
That's that section
we have there.

22:19.042 --> 22:22.083
Below that, in that same hole,
very soft material.

22:22.208 --> 22:24.333
There was no wood
left or right of it.

22:24.458 --> 22:26.833
I think we're into
another tunnel.

22:27.917 --> 22:30.083
RICK:
This might be
completely unknown.

22:30.208 --> 22:31.292
CRAIG:
Yeah.

22:31.417 --> 22:33.042
Well, this is a new find.

22:33.167 --> 22:35.542
It's a good indication that

22:35.667 --> 22:38.125
we've got, you know,
something going on in this area.

22:38.250 --> 22:39.667
Right.

22:39.792 --> 22:42.500
This presents another
unique opportunity,

22:42.583 --> 22:45.125
and that is that if we find

22:45.250 --> 22:47.417
a tunnel, and we get
a bearing off of it,

22:47.542 --> 22:49.375
and it leads uphill,

22:49.542 --> 22:52.292
then that presents
a very unique opportunity

22:52.375 --> 22:54.875
to run a series of holes
with the sonic drill.

22:55.042 --> 22:56.542
That's the idea.

22:56.667 --> 22:58.250
MARTY:
If you find a tunnel
going upwards,

22:58.375 --> 22:59.958
it almost has to be
an offset chamber.

23:00.042 --> 23:01.500
There's no point in having
an upward-facing

23:01.625 --> 23:03.167
-tunnel, is there?
-No.

23:03.292 --> 23:04.333
So, yeah.

23:04.458 --> 23:05.875
I-I would want to follow that.

23:34.542 --> 23:36.750

23:36.875 --> 23:38.708
an offset chamber

in an offset chamber,</i>

23:41.833 --> 23:45.333

24:05.042 --> 24:08.667

promise in the Garden Shaft,

24:08.792 --> 24:10.917
once we get to the bottom
of that Garden Shaft,

24:11.042 --> 24:13.958
we can do vertical
and horizontal probing.

If we find this

24:16.792 --> 24:19.708
at the bottom of that shaft
as we probe out,

24:19.833 --> 24:23.333
there may be a way to tunnel
to it and find out what it is.

24:23.458 --> 24:25.667
Is it your upward chamber?

24:25.792 --> 24:28.083
From that perspective,
it's incredibly exciting.

24:28.208 --> 24:29.667
Yeah.

24:29.792 --> 24:31.333

-Yeah, that's where we went.
-Oh, that's cool.

25:33.167 --> 25:34.625
Probably part of a stove.

-MARTY: All right.
-And it was quite deep.

25:36.792 --> 25:38.542

digging deeper.

MARTY:
Hmm.

25:41.375 --> 25:42.833
And we found these two pieces.

25:42.958 --> 25:45.375
-Very similar.
-Pins of some sort.

25:45.500 --> 25:47.042
What do you guess?

25:47.167 --> 25:51.458
Some kind of fasteners,
unless they're chisels.

25:51.583 --> 25:54.500
So, if they were fasteners,
that's where

25:54.625 --> 25:55.792
they broke off.

25:55.875 --> 25:57.375
-Yeah.
-Well, they're massive,

25:57.500 --> 25:59.375
whatever they are.

25:59.500 --> 26:01.958
And we found this.

26:03.625 --> 26:05.542
This is my favorite.

26:05.667 --> 26:07.250
-Look at that.
-(chuckles)

26:07.375 --> 26:09.000
That's beautiful.

26:09.125 --> 26:10.667
Gary thought that
it could be a wharf pin.

26:10.750 --> 26:12.583
Yeah, but based on what
Carmen Legge has told us

26:12.708 --> 26:14.167
previously, I think
that's too thick

26:14.250 --> 26:16.083
and not long enough.

26:16.208 --> 26:17.667
-I think this is one
of those rock chisels.
-GARY: Yeah.

26:17.750 --> 26:19.042
MARTY:
I'm hoping.
It's been pounded on.

26:19.167 --> 26:20.708
Begs the question,
what were they doing

26:20.833 --> 26:22.208
inland from the beach?

26:22.333 --> 26:24.792
We've got so many iron objects.

26:24.875 --> 26:27.500
Finding them is one thing,

26:27.625 --> 26:29.333
having them tell a story
is quite another.

26:29.500 --> 26:31.833
<i>MARTY:

26:31.958 --> 26:35.208
<i>over here with some very
significant finds from Lot 32.</i>

26:35.333 --> 26:37.417
<i>And it's very intriguing because</i>

26:37.542 --> 26:39.208
there's an awful lot of stuff,

26:39.375 --> 26:40.958
metal stuff in this one spot.

26:41.042 --> 26:43.125
And these all came out
of one hole?

26:43.208 --> 26:44.542
Like how big? Like a big,
giant hole or how big?

26:44.708 --> 26:46.583
Uh, it was deep,

26:46.708 --> 26:49.000
it was maybe a few feet wide.

26:49.125 --> 26:50.625
And we need probably

26:50.750 --> 26:52.833
mechanical means
of digging it up.

28:30.125 --> 28:32.042
JACK:
Are you getting any other hits?

28:32.208 --> 28:35.500
Nothing worth investigating
at the moment.

28:35.625 --> 28:38.292
We do know there's
some older stuff deeper.

28:38.417 --> 28:42.333
Marty, around like here
is the original grade.

28:43.292 --> 28:45.542
MARTY:
More? Do you want
to get in the hole?

28:45.708 --> 28:47.083
RICK:
Do you want to jump in there?

28:47.208 --> 28:48.042
Yep.

28:48.208 --> 28:50.250
Coming in.

28:54.250 --> 28:56.167
MARTY:
I think there's all kinds of
stuff in there. (laughs)

28:56.292 --> 28:57.583
Yeah, there is.

28:57.708 --> 28:59.708
(detector beeping)

28:59.875 --> 29:01.250

GARY:
Two-way repeatable.

29:11.583 --> 29:13.750
Yep, we're on it.

29:14.917 --> 29:17.917
That is lead sheathing.

29:18.042 --> 29:20.625
-Is it really?
-GARY: Yeah,
that's lead sheathing.

29:20.708 --> 29:22.500
MARTY:
300-year-old duct tape.

29:22.625 --> 29:24.000
-GARY: Yep.
-LAIRD: Yep.

29:24.125 --> 29:26.208
-Or older.
-GARY: Yeah.

29:26.375 --> 29:28.667
I think the lead's got something
to do with shipping.

29:28.792 --> 29:30.000
-Me, too.
-GARY: Yeah.

29:30.125 --> 29:33.000
<i>NARRATOR:
Lead sheathing? Found in an area</i>

29:33.167 --> 29:36.250
<i>where the team has previously
discovered evidence of a wharf?</i>

29:36.375 --> 29:41.125
<i>Dating back to the 3rd
century BC in ancient Greece,</i>

29:41.250 --> 29:44.667
<i>lead was commonly used
in the construction and repair</i>

29:44.750 --> 29:47.833
<i>of sailing vessels due to
its versatility and resistance</i>

29:47.958 --> 29:50.417
<i>to corrosion during
long journeys at sea.</i>

29:51.333 --> 29:53.333
Yeah, that's
a nice piece of lead.

29:53.458 --> 29:55.042
Mm-hmm.

29:55.167 --> 29:57.167
They used to line
the hulls of old

29:57.333 --> 29:59.333
sailing ships
with lead sheathing.

29:59.500 --> 30:01.042
JACK:
So, it might actually be

30:01.167 --> 30:02.833
-a really significant find.
-GARY: Yeah.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.917
<i>NARRATOR:
Could this piece
of lead sheathing</i>

30:05.042 --> 30:06.917

<i>might the team find
to explain just who was here?</i>

30:16.375 --> 30:20.208
<i>When? And what else
they may have left behind?</i>

30:21.167 --> 30:23.042
Oh, ho, ho, what is that?

30:24.208 --> 30:25.333
Any ideas?

30:27.708 --> 30:30.000
LAIRD:
That almost looks like a handle.

30:30.083 --> 30:33.667
GARY:
Flat iron.
Some kind of ridge on it.

30:33.792 --> 30:36.458
Could be off, like,
a little ship's stove.

30:36.542 --> 30:37.583
LAIRD:
Yeah.

30:37.708 --> 30:39.958
MARTY:
I'd keep digging.

30:40.083 --> 30:41.583
There could be more down here.

-Yeah.
-Okay, coming out.

30:44.875 --> 30:46.667
<i>RICK:
We know that</i>

30:46.833 --> 30:49.000
a number of finds on Lot 32

have been associated
with maritime activity.

30:52.542 --> 30:54.792
<i>I.E., the lead bag seal,</i>

30:54.875 --> 30:57.750

That's the hope.

31:09.250 --> 31:11.292
-Oh.
-It looks like
some kind of tool.

31:11.417 --> 31:13.875
-JACK: Look at this, Laird.
-Any ideas, Laird?

31:15.583 --> 31:17.875
I think it's hand-forged.

31:18.042 --> 31:19.792
That's just got
an old feel about it.

31:19.917 --> 31:22.167
-Yeah.
-GARY: All of these
artifacts we're

31:22.250 --> 31:24.667
pulling out of this hole,
totally different.

31:24.792 --> 31:27.167
-If you wanted to prove
that something went on...
-Yeah.

31:27.292 --> 31:28.667
...this is the way to do it.

31:28.750 --> 31:29.625
I'm sure we're
gonna find some more.

31:31.167 --> 31:33.375
<i>MARTY:
One encouraging sign
with this pile of metal</i>

31:33.500 --> 31:36.792
<i>that we're finding on Lot 32
is that Lot 32 is very close</i>

31:36.917 --> 31:39.375
<i>to Lot 30 where there
is some sort of anomaly.</i>

31:39.500 --> 31:41.792
Why are all these
artifacts showing up?

31:41.917 --> 31:43.542
(chuckles)

31:43.708 --> 31:45.917
A big chunk of iron.

31:46.042 --> 31:47.833
But there's
still more down there.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.333

You'd do this all day and all

31:58.542 --> 32:00.333
Yeah, I could.

32:00.500 --> 32:02.208
<i>MARTY:
The hope is that these
are puzzle pieces</i>

32:02.375 --> 32:03.417
<i>that help explain what happened
on this island.</i>

32:03.542 --> 32:04.500
<i>That's the hope.</i>

32:06.375 --> 32:07.708
What is that?

32:07.875 --> 32:10.583
It's a smorgasbord of artifacts.

32:10.708 --> 32:12.417
That what it is, mate.

32:12.542 --> 32:14.958

-for the rest of your life.
-Yeah.

32:17.292 --> 32:19.167

shovel-full out of there?

32:19.333 --> 32:21.125
-I vote yes.
-(chuckles)

<i>GARY:
This has been
an amazing experience.</i>

the more we find.

32:30.708 --> 32:33.833
<i>It's painting a clear picture</i>

32:41.708 --> 32:43.125
Probably a piece
off a fireplace.

32:43.208 --> 32:45.917
-JACK: Nice.
-GARY: Just so many pieces.

32:46.042 --> 32:49.708

be a very important site.

GARY:
It's tough to tell on this.

RICK:
Sounded good.

33:11.375 --> 33:14.375
GARY:
Something wedged
underneath here.

This might be
something really cool.

<i>GARY: Do you want to

33:57.750 --> 33:58.750
Yeah. Probably.

34:27.917 --> 34:31.042
Oh, look at that! That's nice.

That's like an old strap.

34:33.042 --> 34:35.208

Wow.

34:37.208 --> 34:41.458
What is that? A strap?
Look at this.

34:43.708 --> 34:47.458
What do you think that's
a strap to, Laird? Any idea?

34:47.542 --> 34:49.083
LAIRD:
No.

34:50.750 --> 34:52.208
It could be to a chest.

34:52.375 --> 34:53.667
LAIRD:
Quite possible.

34:53.792 --> 34:56.292
<i>RICK: Are these
maritime-related objects?</i>

34:56.375 --> 34:59.042
This is a possible
strap to a chest.

34:59.167 --> 35:03.000
Well, it certainly
fits into the treasure story.

35:03.125 --> 35:05.958
<i>The facts are we've
made significant finds</i>

35:06.042 --> 35:09.333
<i>at a very specific location,

35:09.458 --> 35:12.375
<i>necessary to try to understand
what these items are.</i>

35:12.500 --> 35:15.208
And then you can speculate.

35:15.333 --> 35:18.042
-There was probably
a wharf here.
-RICK: Exactly.

35:18.167 --> 35:19.833
Might help explain
some of these finds.

35:19.958 --> 35:21.625
Everything is tied together.

35:21.708 --> 35:24.333
You just have to keep
layering things to derive

35:24.458 --> 35:26.333
all the information
possible from a site.

35:26.458 --> 35:30.792
This has been
a pretty successful dig, eh?

35:30.875 --> 35:33.500
I think I'd like to take some
of the artifacts back, get Emma

35:33.625 --> 35:37.250
to CT scan them and kind
of evaluate what's going on.

35:37.375 --> 35:42.208
What interests us about Lot 32
is really the number of finds

35:42.333 --> 35:45.250
that Gary was getting
from one particular spot.

35:45.375 --> 35:47.417
There's an incredible variety.

35:47.542 --> 35:49.667
-No doubt about that.
-Yep.

<i>LAIRD:
The agreement we have
with the province</i>

35:51.750 --> 35:54.583
<i>is that if Gary finds
a concentration of artifacts,</i>

35:54.708 --> 35:57.917
<i>we'll go in and set up
a test unit in that area</i>

35:58.042 --> 36:01.458

those finds are significant.

the loose...

I'll try not to dig any deeper.
I'll just clean this.

36:07.333 --> 36:08.958
Yup. Yeah,
and then we'll come back

36:09.042 --> 36:11.708

and set up a unit.

36:11.833 --> 36:13.083
Good. All right.

<i>21.8% from 1648 to 1695.</i>

37:27.375 --> 37:30.500
We can eliminate the 1900s

because we know historically
there wasn't any

37:41.667 --> 37:43.583
Correct. More
than that I would say.

<i>from two different boreholes
that may date back</i>

38:43.875 --> 38:48.458
<i>approximately a century before
the discovery of the Money Pit.</i>

38:48.583 --> 38:51.250
I mean, the really odd thing
about this is the 70-foot depth.

38:51.375 --> 38:54.667
You know, why was
anybody at that depth?

38:54.750 --> 38:56.625
DOUG: At that depth, it doesn't
seem to correlate

38:56.750 --> 39:00.375
with a searcher's effort to
get to the treasure chamber.

39:00.542 --> 39:02.333
-Yeah.
<i>-NARRATOR: Could
the test results</i>

39:02.458 --> 39:04.542
<i>from borehole L-16</i>

39:04.708 --> 39:07.792
<i>and borehole D-17,
which sets just 20 feet</i>

39:07.917 --> 39:09.792
<i>from the Garden Shaft</i>

39:09.917 --> 39:12.500
<i>and a possible
vast deposit of gold,</i>

39:12.625 --> 39:15.500
<i>mean that the team is
close to a major breakthrough</i>

39:15.667 --> 39:19.500
<i>in solving
the 227-year-old mystery?</i>

39:19.625 --> 39:22.583
<i>We don't have anybody
looking at 70 feet, do we?</i>

39:22.708 --> 39:24.958
<i>Anywhere in the historical
record. Do we?</i>

39:25.083 --> 39:26.625
-CRAIG: Correct.
-That is correct.

39:26.750 --> 39:27.500
STEVE G.: Could be related
to the Garden Shaft

39:27.667 --> 39:29.167
just strictly based on depth.

39:29.292 --> 39:31.667
We know the Garden Shaft bottoms
out at 77 and a half feet.

39:31.833 --> 39:33.417
It would make sense
to tunnel out.

39:33.542 --> 39:34.375
<i>MARTY:
That's great.</i>

39:34.542 --> 39:35.458
I think that's the most

39:35.542 --> 39:37.167
interesting result of all,

39:37.292 --> 39:39.917
because at 70 feet it almost
has to be an offset chamber.

39:40.042 --> 39:41.167
That's right.

39:41.292 --> 39:42.750
<i>RICK:
D-17 may lead</i>

39:42.875 --> 39:44.667
<i>to what my brother has
often described</i>

39:44.750 --> 39:47.000
<i>as an offset chamber
where treasure is deposited.</i>

39:47.083 --> 39:48.333
<i>Is it exciting?</i>

39:48.458 --> 39:49.667
Absolutely.

39:49.833 --> 39:51.667
Marty's offset chamber within

39:51.833 --> 39:54.417
20 feet of the Garden Shaft?
Could be.

39:54.542 --> 39:58.708
<i>Because of the indications
of some human activity</i>

39:58.875 --> 40:01.333
<i>at a depth and an area
previously unknown to us,</i>

40:01.458 --> 40:04.333
<i>there's obviously the chance
that you'll find the one thing.</i>

40:04.458 --> 40:06.500
<i>I mean, nothing would be
better than that.</i>

40:06.667 --> 40:08.000
<i>But that's what this island is.</i>

40:08.167 --> 40:10.500
It's an island of
what-ifs and possibilities,

40:10.667 --> 40:12.542
and you have to chase them all.

40:13.583 --> 40:15.792
What's interesting is
we continue to be

40:15.875 --> 40:17.708
mesmerized by
the Oak Island mystery.

40:17.875 --> 40:19.750
It's complex.
It's difficult.

40:19.875 --> 40:22.250
And we just
have to follow the data.

40:22.375 --> 40:23.792
Yes. Exactly.

40:23.875 --> 40:27.417
And the data continues
to be quite provocative.

40:27.542 --> 40:28.417
-Yeah.
-Yep.

40:28.542 --> 40:30.625
So, let's start

40:30.750 --> 40:32.542
getting some real answers.
(chuckles)

40:33.333 --> 40:35.875
-Yep.
-So, thank you, guys.

40:36.042 --> 40:37.250
We'll see you later.

40:37.375 --> 40:38.667
<i>MARTY:
Cheers, guys. Good job.</i>

40:38.792 --> 40:40.625
<i>-DOUG: See you.
-MARTY: Carry on.</i>

40:40.750 --> 40:43.167
<i>NARRATOR:
As another incredible week</i>

40:43.333 --> 40:44.958
<i>comes to an end on Oak Island,</i>

40:45.042 --> 40:49.167
<i>Rick, Marty, Craig
and their team have collected</i>

40:49.292 --> 40:53.000
<i>more key pieces to help
complete the Oak Island puzzle.</i>

40:53.125 --> 40:55.958
<i>With meaningful new discoveries
in the Money Pit area,</i>

40:56.042 --> 40:58.667
<i>and on the western
side of the island,</i>

40:58.833 --> 41:01.833
<i>could they now be on
the verge of identifying</i>

41:01.958 --> 41:06.083
<i>just who was behind
the 227-year-old mystery?</i>

41:06.208 --> 41:10.583
<i>And as they prepare for
their most ambitious dig yet,</i>

41:10.708 --> 41:14.500
<i>will a fabled vault of
riches that were left behind</i>

41:14.625 --> 41:18.125
<i>soon be within their reach?</i>

41:19.833 --> 41:22.375
<i>Next time on</i>
The Curse of Oak Island...

41:22.542 --> 41:23.500
-JACK: Oh, there we go.
-GARY: Wow.

41:23.583 --> 41:25.458
The heck is that?

41:25.542 --> 41:27.750
It was very common
during the middle 1700s.

41:27.875 --> 41:31.000
<i>CORJAN: In 1746,
King Louis XV sent two ships</i>

41:31.125 --> 41:34.042
<i>to Oak Island, where they
later created the Money Pit.</i>

41:34.208 --> 41:37.708
<i>RICK:
If we can find original
works at the base of this shaft,</i>

41:37.833 --> 41:39.667
<i>it may solve the mystery.</i>

41:39.750 --> 41:40.958
Oh, what's that?
Whoa. Whoa. What's that?

41:41.083 --> 41:42.583
STEVE G.:
That's a view down the tunnel.

41:42.708 --> 41:44.167
Is it possible that
this tunnel could lead to

41:44.292 --> 41:45.417
finding the treasure?

41:45.542 --> 41:46.833
The answer is
unequivocally yes.
