01:28.254 --> 01:29.839
{\an8}- You took me out on two dates

01:29.923 --> 01:31.090
{\an8}and then never called me again?

01:31.174 --> 01:33.301
{\an8}- Yes yes, I remember.

01:33.384 --> 01:36.513
{\an8}- Good. So uh,
what's going on back there?

01:36.596 --> 01:39.474
{\an8}- Well, we got a report
that there were two thugs

01:39.557 --> 01:42.769
{\an8}in the park,
vandalizing bushes and shrubs,

01:42.852 --> 01:44.604
{\an8}you know
intimidating squirrels...

01:44.687 --> 01:45.980
{\an8}Is that an engagement ring?

01:46.064 --> 01:48.566
{\an8}- Oh this?
Sure is.

01:50.235 --> 01:52.529
{\an8}- Wh...what, did you
buy that for yourself?

01:52.612 --> 01:54.531
{\an8}- No. A man gave it to me.

01:54.614 --> 01:56.908
{\an8}- Hey dude, dude!
I really need your help!

01:56.991 --> 01:59.202
{\an8}- Just just just a second...
- No these guys are big man.

01:59.285 --> 02:02.872
They're big! They're bigger
than we've ever aaaaa--

02:02.956 --> 02:06.042
{\an8}- Who asked you to marry him?

02:06.125 --> 02:09.294
{\an8}- My camera man, right there.

02:09.378 --> 02:11.714
{\an8}- What, this guy?!?
- Hey!

02:13.508 --> 02:17.554
{\an8}- So you went from
Captain Man to "camera" man?!?

02:17.637 --> 02:19.681
{\an8}Oh that's good.

02:19.764 --> 02:21.391
{\an8}- Shouldn't you be
helping Kid Danger?

02:21.474 --> 02:23.184
{\an8}- Nah, he's fine.
- I'm not fine!

02:23.268 --> 02:27.897
{\an8}- Y'see uh, Kid Danger has
hyper-motility, so, y'know.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.357
{\an8}- I'm sorry, he has what?

02:29.440 --> 02:32.569
{\an8}- Uh, hyper-motility.
He has that.

02:32.652 --> 02:34.863
{\an8}- Oh. Uh...
And is it serious?

02:34.946 --> 02:37.448
{\an8}- Pfft, yeah, really serious.

02:37.532 --> 02:40.410
{\an8}- Well, is hyper-motility
deadly?

02:40.493 --> 02:44.247
{\an8}- Uh, it can be!
A-heh heh.

02:44.330 --> 02:46.457
{\an8}Y'know, I took her out
on two dates.

02:46.541 --> 02:48.084
{\an8}- Yeah?
Why don't you shut up.

02:48.167 --> 02:49.586
- You shut up.

02:51.129 --> 02:53.715
- Captain Man! Can you
come here right now please?

02:53.798 --> 02:56.050
{\an8}- Ulch.
You're lucky he needs me.

03:00.513 --> 03:02.056
{\an8}- You heard it here first.

03:02.140 --> 03:04.392
{\an8}Kid Danger has hyper-motility.

03:07.979 --> 03:09.898
- How's it goin'?

03:09.981 --> 03:11.107
- Do you have any water?

03:11.190 --> 03:12.901
- Oh, yeah.

What are you guys watching?

03:33.338 --> 03:35.423
- SHHHHHHH!!!
It's a news report about you!

03:35.506 --> 03:39.218
- Yeah, they're talkin' about--
- SHHHHHHH!!!

03:39.302 --> 03:40.887
{\an8}- According to
Captain Man himself,

03:40.970 --> 03:43.473
{\an8}Kid Danger has been stricken
with a serious, rare disease,

03:43.556 --> 03:44.974
{\an8}known as "hyper-motility."

03:45.058 --> 03:47.310
- Wait...what disease?
What are they talking about--

03:47.393 --> 03:48.978
- Shhhhh!
- Shush!

03:49.062 --> 03:50.396

Doctor Andrew Skurvy.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.609
{\an8}- Good afternoon Trent.

03:54.692 --> 03:58.029
{\an8}- What can you tell us about
this disease, hyper-motility?

03:58.112 --> 03:59.864
{\an8}- I've never heard of it.

04:01.032 --> 04:03.076
- Interesting.

04:03.159 --> 04:04.786
{\an8}- But I will say,
diseases, in general,

04:04.869 --> 04:07.372
{\an8}can cause big problems.

04:07.455 --> 04:08.957
{\an8}- I see.
And in what ways do you feel

04:09.040 --> 04:11.501
{\an8}that hyper-motility
might affect Kid Danger?

04:11.584 --> 04:13.461
{\an8}- Well, it could lead
to an increase,

04:13.544 --> 04:15.838
{\an8}or decrease
in his appetite...

04:15.922 --> 04:19.175
{\an8}high or low blood pressure...

04:19.257 --> 04:20.426
{\an8}uh, it could
cause weight gain...

04:20.510 --> 04:22.011
{\an8}- Or weight loss?
- Possibly.

04:22.095 --> 04:25.014
- Ulch okay you know what?
I'm turning this off.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.725

05:32.999 --> 05:34.500
I wanted an after-school job.

05:34.584 --> 05:36.085
But then,
an indestructible superhero

05:36.169 --> 05:37.837
hired me to be his sidekick.

05:37.920 --> 05:38.796

06:16.334 --> 06:17.293
- What are you doin'?

06:17.376 --> 06:18.419
- I'm trying to count rocks,

06:18.503 --> 06:21.214
{\an8}which isn't easy
when you have a dumb brother

06:21.297 --> 06:23.966

Okay, why are you

06:35.728 --> 06:37.522
- The ro--What is?
What is the rock box dump?

06:37.605 --> 06:41.317
- The rock box dump
is what people are doing

06:41.400 --> 06:42.777
to help raise money
for Kid Danger

06:42.860 --> 06:45.363
and increase awareness
of hypermotility.

06:45.446 --> 06:48.241
- Oh my god. Listen to me.
Kid Danger isn't sick. Okay?

06:48.324 --> 06:50.326

I guess that's a positive
way of looking at it.

07:06.050 --> 07:07.760
- Hehehehe...

07:07.844 --> 07:10.179
- Look, Piper,

07:10.263 --> 07:12.765
all that stuff about
Kid Danger being sick

07:12.849 --> 07:14.308
is fake news.

07:14.392 --> 07:16.936
- If Kid Danger isn't sick,
then why are people

07:17.019 --> 07:19.355
doing the rock box dump
to raise money to help him?

07:19.438 --> 07:22.024
- No one's doing
the "rock box dump."

07:22.108 --> 07:23.401

It's me, Oliver.

07:28.698 --> 07:30.533
And to help raise money
for hypermotility awareness,

07:30.616 --> 07:34.704
I'm gonna' dump a box
of rocks on my head.

07:34.787 --> 07:36.664
One, two...

07:38.207 --> 07:40.376
Owwwwie!

07:40.459 --> 07:42.670
- Well...Oliver
doesn't know anything. Okay?

07:42.753 --> 07:46.465
- Okay, then let's take a look
at one of your teachers.

07:46.549 --> 07:49.051
- My teach--
- Look!

07:49.135 --> 07:50.595

07:53.764 --> 07:56.058
And I'm gonna take
two boxes of rocks

07:56.142 --> 07:58.144
to show my support
for Kid Danger,

07:58.227 --> 08:01.022
and the fight against
hyper-motility.

08:01.105 --> 08:03.774
Give it to me!

08:03.858 --> 08:06.986
Ohhhh...

08:07.069 --> 08:08.404
- 'Kay well...

08:08.487 --> 08:11.574

doing the "rock box dump."

08:11.657 --> 08:13.117
- M'kay...

08:13.201 --> 08:14.911
how 'bout this guy?

08:14.994 --> 08:16.495
- Hey guys.

08:16.579 --> 08:20.291
Now, I don't know
Kid Danger personally...

08:20.374 --> 08:21.584
Heh...Eh...
But anyways...

08:21.667 --> 08:24.462
this is to help him
get well soon.

08:27.590 --> 08:31.761
Ah! Ah!
Cheese-n-rice!

08:34.722 --> 08:37.390
I want my community
to think I'm caring!

08:37.475 --> 08:40.186
- Ooo yes!
It's working!

08:40.269 --> 08:41.437
- What's working?

08:41.520 --> 08:44.148
- Uh, I want to raise money
for hypermotility,

08:44.232 --> 08:45.650
so I set up
a Beg-U-To-FundMe page.

08:45.733 --> 08:48.444
See? For every dollar
that people donate,

08:48.527 --> 08:50.529
I'm gonna add one
rock to this pile

08:50.613 --> 08:52.573
that I'm gonna dump
on my own head.

08:52.657 --> 08:56.452
- What?!?
- And I'm already up to $794!

08:56.535 --> 08:58.663
- Piper...
- Don't touch me!

09:01.040 --> 09:03.834
- Well, I-I-I-I think it's great
that you wanna raise money

09:03.918 --> 09:05.294
to help fight diseases,
y'know but...

09:05.378 --> 09:07.296
- Then why are you whining?

09:07.380 --> 09:10.967
- 'Cuz hyper-motility
isn't a disease!

09:11.050 --> 09:13.344
- You're so dumb.

09:13.427 --> 09:15.304
- Well, I'm smart enough to know

09:15.388 --> 09:17.348
that if you dump 794 rocks
on your head,

09:17.431 --> 09:19.308
you're gonna end up
in the Swellview Hospital.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.060
- Ulch, no I won't.
- Piper...

09:21.143 --> 09:22.395
- I'm gonna wear a hat.

09:22.478 --> 09:26.315
- Wha-Wait, Piper...Piper!

09:26.399 --> 09:28.150

09:59.348 --> 10:01.726
Hey...

10:01.809 --> 10:04.186

tried to escape...

10:04.270 --> 10:08.357
Well? Aw...

10:08.441 --> 10:11.527
No more room in me.

10:11.610 --> 10:14.864
- What is going on?
What happened here?

21:16.525 --> 21:18.193
that really says
"super fast reflexes."

21:18.276 --> 21:20.904

21:20.988 --> 21:23.865
