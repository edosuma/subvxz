No. It's a break-break.
A break-up, Priya.

03:21.040 --> 03:22.480
He's blocked me on everything

03:22.560 --> 03:24.080
and I went to his house
this morning

03:24.160 --> 03:26.280
and his mum said that
he doesn't want to see me

03:26.360 --> 03:28.160
and I shouldn't have
any contact with him.

03:28.240 --> 03:31.360
And I just found out that he's
doing his exams at Marrickville

03:31.440 --> 03:34.640
so I will actually
never see him again.

03:34.720 --> 03:36.560
Oh, I cannot believe
he'd do that to you.

03:36.640 --> 03:38.040

Um, rude!

Brendan just broke up with him
and basically ghosted him

03:50.400 --> 03:51.520

put into question

introduced to my family,

talk to him, but nothing.

So, I got dressed up, went to
his family new year's lunch

04:15.040 --> 04:16.360
because that's what
we always did -

04:16.440 --> 04:18.600
new year's lunch at his,
dinner at mine -

04:18.680 --> 04:20.560
and it was obvious
they weren't expecting me

04:20.640 --> 04:24.040
and he did nothing
to stop it being awkward.

"What a psycho!"

with someone like that

were really nice about it,

I'd have a plus one,

and I have to go on my own.

26:25.080 --> 26:26.880
that you will be really good.

26:26.960 --> 26:28.960
You've just gotta...

26:29.760 --> 26:31.160
Not do dumb shit?

26:31.240 --> 26:33.240
-Pretty much.
-(LAUGHS)

26:35.720 --> 26:37.720
So, things really can
be different?

26:37.800 --> 26:39.800
Yeah.

26:41.120 --> 26:42.640
By the way, sorry.

26:42.720 --> 26:45.080
I appreciate that.

26:45.160 --> 26:47.160
I actually made it, not my nan.

26:48.280 --> 26:50.960
-I'm very touched, mate.
-Good.

26:51.040 --> 26:52.640
(BOWIE LAUGHS)

26:52.720 --> 26:54.720
Oh...

27:02.160 --> 27:05.360

27:09.280 --> 27:11.040
OPHELIA: Why are you even here?!

27:11.120 --> 27:12.720
TRISTAN:
Because your histrionics

27:12.800 --> 27:15.600
suck everything into it
like a vortex!

27:15.680 --> 27:17.520
OPHELIA: Well, I learned
from the fucking best...

27:17.600 --> 27:18.800
GUS: Everything good?

27:18.880 --> 27:20.640
OPHELIA: ..because you are
a master of histrionics!

27:20.720 --> 27:22.640
-Do you want me to go?
-TRISTAN: Stupid slut!

27:22.720 --> 27:24.760
No.

27:24.840 --> 27:26.840
OPHELIA: Don't you dare
call me that!

27:36.840 --> 27:38.840
What happened?

27:39.360 --> 27:41.360
Just the same.

27:45.200 --> 27:48.000
You know how sometimes you think
things could be different?

27:50.720 --> 27:52.120
I feel so stupid

27:52.200 --> 27:56.160
because I sometimes think
things will actually be better.

27:59.640 --> 28:01.000
I'm sorry.

28:01.080 --> 28:03.080
It's not your fault.

28:05.280 --> 28:08.040
Some things just go wrong.
It's the way it is.

28:12.280 --> 28:14.800
No, but what if
we could change that?

28:14.880 --> 28:16.920
What if we can
make it different?

28:18.960 --> 28:20.960
How would it be different?

28:22.560 --> 28:25.320
I mean,
you make me feel awesome

28:25.400 --> 28:27.400
because you're awesome.

28:31.560 --> 28:33.560
See?

28:48.880 --> 28:50.880
But feelings
don't change things.

28:53.080 --> 28:55.080
You saw what happened.
It's a mess.

29:00.520 --> 29:02.520
So, that's it, then.
