To get all the way to the final and
then to lose to that bunch of...

01:55.400 --> 01:57.870
Would you please slow down?

01:57.920 --> 01:59.830
This vehicle is in need
of a jolly good clean.

01:59.880 --> 02:03.150
I should never have given
Sid any time off.

02:03.200 --> 02:06.070
For the last time,
will you slow down?

02:06.120 --> 02:08.229
Urgh, vile.

02:08.280 --> 02:10.669
If he thinks he's getting a tip...

02:10.720 --> 02:14.120
I've got a good mind
to get out and walk!

02:15.880 --> 02:17.750
Beastly little man.

02:17.800 --> 02:19.940
Good riddance, I say.

02:20.080 --> 02:22.430
Where exactly are we?

02:22.480 --> 02:24.550
Miles from anywhere.

02:42.040 --> 02:43.840
Salam.

02:50.360 --> 02:52.790
~ A naked man.
~ Really?

02:52.840 --> 02:54.390
Over there.

02:54.440 --> 02:57.540
He walked straight
out in front of me.

02:57.840 --> 02:59.790
Well, he's not there now.

02:59.840 --> 03:01.910
How much wine have you actually had?

03:01.960 --> 03:05.270
Evesham is just over that hill.

03:05.320 --> 03:08.470
Oh, Lord Delcott lives there.
He'll arrange a lift.

03:08.520 --> 03:10.310
Right.

03:10.360 --> 03:11.960
Come along.

03:19.880 --> 03:22.020
And where is Evesham?

03:23.160 --> 03:24.350
Ah.

03:24.400 --> 03:26.600
These heels are murder.

03:28.680 --> 03:30.310
Oh. Ugh.

03:30.360 --> 03:32.110
Is that blood?

03:32.160 --> 03:34.190
Probably animal.

03:34.240 --> 03:36.470
There's a lot of traps about.

03:36.520 --> 03:38.670
Diabolical contraptions.

LADIES GASP

03:46.080 --> 03:49.380
Let's head for that
building over there.

03:54.840 --> 03:58.910
If I had known you were invited,
I'd never have come.

03:58.960 --> 04:00.360
Deviant.

04:02.760 --> 04:04.630
You're no different to me.

04:04.680 --> 04:06.630
In fact, you're worse.

04:06.680 --> 04:09.420
Nothing but a whining hypocrite.

04:10.800 --> 04:13.340
Not fighting over me, I hope?

04:14.880 --> 04:17.420
Forgive my behaviour, madame.

04:19.399 --> 04:22.950
Why, Dr Barashi,

04:23.000 --> 04:25.360
your pipe has gone out.

04:26.360 --> 04:30.360
If you need a refill, there's
more in the lounge.

04:30.720 --> 04:32.670
So...

04:32.720 --> 04:35.630
have my two little tarts arrived yet?

04:35.680 --> 04:37.070
No.

04:37.120 --> 04:38.710
But forget about them.

04:38.760 --> 04:42.520
Tomorrow evening, you will have
all the pleasure you desire.

04:43.560 --> 04:45.470
Tomorrow!

04:45.520 --> 04:49.220
I should have stayed
in London another night.

04:54.560 --> 04:56.630
You madman!

04:56.680 --> 04:58.990
It was an accident.

04:59.040 --> 05:00.670
No.

05:00.720 --> 05:02.870
It's because I beat him at poker.

05:02.920 --> 05:06.110
Syrus, watch where
you're pointing that.

05:06.160 --> 05:07.990
She means the pistol.

05:08.040 --> 05:10.950
Madame Chania, I will
not be an object of fun!

05:11.000 --> 05:12.510
Please, calm down.

05:12.560 --> 05:14.990
You have mocked me for the last time.

05:15.040 --> 05:17.190
~ It's always the same.
~ Syrus...

05:17.240 --> 05:19.150
Insults whenever we meet.

05:19.200 --> 05:21.270
London, Paris, Rome.

05:47.800 --> 05:49.350
Still not working.

05:49.400 --> 05:53.070
And my guests arrived by taxi, so
there's no-one here to drive you.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.510
Are there no vehicles?

05:54.560 --> 05:55.870
No.

05:55.920 --> 05:58.390
Well, it's getting very late.
We'll have to stay the night.

05:58.440 --> 05:59.870
In Sodom and Gomorrah?

05:59.920 --> 06:01.710
Sorry, we're fully booked.

06:01.760 --> 06:04.030
Surely you can find them somewhere.

06:04.080 --> 06:06.030
Thank heavens he's dressed.

06:06.080 --> 06:09.200
~ Perhaps the maid could give
up her room for the lady?
~ Er...

06:10.960 --> 06:13.190
I can sleep in the attic, madame.

06:13.240 --> 06:16.270
Very well. And the good Father
can stay in the cottage...

06:16.320 --> 06:18.470
with your servant.

06:18.520 --> 06:21.600
~ Servant?
~ What a splendid idea. Problem solved.

06:25.680 --> 06:27.000
Fork!

06:30.320 --> 06:31.860
Apologies.

06:35.760 --> 06:37.110
Feed me.

06:37.160 --> 06:39.270
Scusi?

06:39.320 --> 06:40.880
Feed me.

06:52.600 --> 06:56.270
Please, help yourself
to food and drink.

06:56.320 --> 06:59.360
Mimi, could you pour the wine?

07:04.720 --> 07:07.910
So, have you owned this place long?

07:07.960 --> 07:09.910
I am only leasing it.

07:09.960 --> 07:14.950
A little venture of mine while
staying in your beautiful country.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.590
So...

07:16.640 --> 07:19.070
the priest is staying the night?

07:19.120 --> 07:22.870
Yes. May be fun watching
his halo slip, no?

07:22.920 --> 07:25.120
You are very honoured.

07:25.720 --> 07:28.990
Madame Chania's guests
are invitation only.

07:29.040 --> 07:31.830
How do you all know each other?

07:31.880 --> 07:34.430
Actually, I only know
my guests by reputation.

07:34.480 --> 07:37.830
International playboys,
very notorious.

07:37.880 --> 07:39.830
Really?

07:39.880 --> 07:42.830
When I heard they were in London
for a poker tournament,

07:42.880 --> 07:45.510
I just had to invite
them for the weekend.

07:45.560 --> 07:47.550
An offer we could not resist.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.030
Really?

07:49.080 --> 07:50.350
Tomorrow night,

07:50.400 --> 07:54.790
we have a touring entourage
of genuine Japanese geishas,

07:54.840 --> 07:59.270
all willing to fulfil any whim

07:59.320 --> 08:02.110
or any desire of my guests.

08:02.160 --> 08:03.270
Oh.

08:03.320 --> 08:04.950
We'll be gone by then.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.800
Do you partake in the, er...

08:09.720 --> 08:11.710
.. entertainment?

08:11.760 --> 08:15.470
~ I am not attracted to women,
if that's what you mean.
~ Oh, no...

08:15.520 --> 08:19.280
My passion is providing
pleasure for others.

08:21.240 --> 08:24.200
~ You do not approve, Father?
~ Well...

08:26.520 --> 08:30.950
We all have passionate
desires we should embrace,

08:31.000 --> 08:34.630
whether it be fine food, alcohol...

08:34.679 --> 08:36.110
Sex.

08:36.159 --> 08:37.950
Naturism.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.360
Or even religion.

08:42.240 --> 08:46.140
We cannot, should not,
deny what makes us happy.

08:48.160 --> 08:50.110
Mmm...

08:50.160 --> 08:52.230
but there's the paradox.

08:52.280 --> 08:53.750
Paradox?

08:53.800 --> 08:56.900
Well, happiness is
an unexpected gift.

08:57.440 --> 08:59.180
It is evasive.

09:00.160 --> 09:03.560
If we pursue it, we
will never achieve it.

09:04.600 --> 09:06.390
Utter nonsense.

09:06.440 --> 09:09.150
No, the Father has a point.

09:09.200 --> 09:12.240
I've spent years
overindulging, and for what?

09:13.760 --> 09:16.550
I'm not even sure what
it is to be happy.

09:16.600 --> 09:22.030
Oh, Count, not thinking of retiring
and settling down, are we?

09:22.080 --> 09:23.800
Who knows?

09:40.520 --> 09:42.920
Isn't that for the guests?

09:46.080 --> 09:48.790
Still no sign of the girls I ordered.

09:48.840 --> 09:50.640
Sorry, no.

09:52.480 --> 09:54.150
Well...

09:54.200 --> 09:55.910
I can't wait.

09:55.960 --> 09:58.190
Name your price.

09:58.240 --> 10:00.960
Please do not ask me that.

10:02.560 --> 10:04.390
Oh, sorry.

10:04.440 --> 10:06.910
I didn't mean to offend you.

10:10.000 --> 10:14.310
I'm frightfully sorry, but
my head is simply splitting.

10:14.360 --> 10:16.790
The first left at the
top of the stairs.

10:16.840 --> 10:19.710
Thank you. Good night.

10:19.760 --> 10:21.360
Good night.

10:23.160 --> 10:26.310
You've had more helpings
than me, Father.

10:26.360 --> 10:29.150
Lovely. Really lovely.

10:29.200 --> 10:32.310
"A weekend of unbridled excess."

10:32.360 --> 10:34.870
More like a child's party.

10:34.920 --> 10:37.880
Patience, Doctor. Patience.

10:42.680 --> 10:45.550
Most here are dreadful bores.

10:45.600 --> 10:49.230
If it were not for you, I would
have retired to my room.

10:49.280 --> 10:50.830
Oh.

10:50.880 --> 10:53.760
Mrs McCarthy, may I speak freely?

10:55.200 --> 10:56.870
If you must.

10:57.720 --> 11:04.190
The moment I saw you, I knew
there was something very...

11:04.240 --> 11:05.910
simple about you.

11:05.960 --> 11:08.710
Simple?

11:08.760 --> 11:10.590
Forgive my English.

11:10.640 --> 11:14.470
Wholesome. Homely.

11:14.520 --> 11:18.880
In my circles, that is
a breath of fresh air.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.990
Oh...

11:23.040 --> 11:24.800
Father Brown.

11:25.880 --> 11:30.310
Looks like your whisky infused cake
does not agree with the Father.

11:30.360 --> 11:34.030
It's more likely to be
the infusion of opium.

11:34.080 --> 11:35.750
You didn't?

11:35.800 --> 11:37.240
I did.

11:41.400 --> 11:42.550
KNOCKING

11:42.600 --> 11:44.960
Come in.

11:47.280 --> 11:50.990
Lady Felicia, please,
may I get my things?

11:51.040 --> 11:52.580
Of course.

11:54.400 --> 11:56.910
Shiatsu is very good for headaches.

11:56.960 --> 11:59.390
Is that Russian?

11:59.440 --> 12:02.030
Allow me to demonstrate.

12:02.080 --> 12:04.120
Very kind.

12:06.080 --> 12:08.600
Please. Close your eyes.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.070
~ Mm.
~ That's it.

12:17.120 --> 12:19.080
Just relax.

12:20.520 --> 12:22.060
Wonderful.

12:23.840 --> 12:26.750
We all have pressure points
throughout our bodies.

12:26.800 --> 12:30.470
Some dull the senses.

12:30.520 --> 12:35.630
And others arouse them.

12:35.680 --> 12:37.950
I really must go to bed.

12:39.880 --> 12:43.480
I'm afraid the cottage
only has one bedroom.

12:44.560 --> 12:46.430
I'll sleep here.

12:48.680 --> 12:49.990
Are you all right?

12:50.040 --> 12:51.510
Mm.

12:51.560 --> 12:54.310
Are you in pain?

12:54.360 --> 12:55.830
Pain, pleasure...

12:55.880 --> 12:58.750
As a hedonist, I choose the latter.

13:00.400 --> 13:02.230
Can't have one without the other.

13:02.280 --> 13:06.510
Who says I can't, you big meanie?

13:06.560 --> 13:08.880
It's getting very late.

13:11.240 --> 13:16.350
We all have passionate
desires we should embrace,

13:16.400 --> 13:22.160
like food, embrace, alcohol,
or even religion.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.590
It was near her body.

13:47.640 --> 13:51.630
Pixie's Palace. Tibb Street, Evesham.

13:51.680 --> 13:54.070
The two tarts I hired.

13:54.120 --> 13:57.550
The doctor could not wait
for tonight's geishas,

13:57.600 --> 14:00.630
so yesterday booked two girls
from a local bordello.

14:00.680 --> 14:03.880
They never arrived. Or so we thought.

14:05.760 --> 14:07.110
So where's the other girl?

14:07.160 --> 14:09.360
The blood on the hill.

14:10.560 --> 14:13.030
Madame Chania, I cannot
call the police.

14:13.080 --> 14:14.750
The line is still dead.

14:14.800 --> 14:17.480
Yes, it's been cut.

14:20.240 --> 14:23.910
May I get you a drink, Mrs McCarthy?

14:23.960 --> 14:25.230
No. You may not.

14:25.280 --> 14:28.510
The sooner I am away from
this hotel, the better.

14:28.560 --> 14:32.110
Perhaps when we have left here,
you would allow me to call on you?

14:32.160 --> 14:34.830
And take you for English tea?

14:34.880 --> 14:36.680
I'm afraid not.

14:37.760 --> 14:41.230
It was foolish of me to accept
Madame Chania's invitation.

14:41.280 --> 14:45.590
Meeting you has made me realise that.

14:45.640 --> 14:48.150
You barely know me.

14:48.200 --> 14:53.400
It's strange, but it does
not feel like that to me.

14:55.640 --> 14:59.340
It was hidden in the
bushes near the cottage.

15:02.080 --> 15:03.430
Must be the girl's.

15:03.480 --> 15:05.670
~ Is it working?
~ It won't start.

15:05.720 --> 15:07.590
So we're still stuck here.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.630
I'm sure it's fixable.

15:09.680 --> 15:12.070
I've covered the body.

15:12.120 --> 15:13.950
Thank you.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.470
That's very decent of you.

15:15.520 --> 15:19.430
You know, Father, there is
only one man in this hotel

15:19.480 --> 15:22.420
who hates women enough to kill them.

15:27.040 --> 15:31.190
I shall be taking all my meals
in my room from now on.

15:31.240 --> 15:32.910
It's the safest place.

15:32.960 --> 15:34.350
Very good, sir.

15:34.400 --> 15:39.910
You know, after death, it's
an instinct to procreate.

15:39.960 --> 15:44.030
It's a biological urge.

15:44.080 --> 15:45.680
Dr Barashi.

15:46.840 --> 15:49.350
Do not touch her again.

15:49.400 --> 15:52.070
Why would you care?

15:52.120 --> 15:55.510
I heard you last night in
your room, slapping her.

15:55.560 --> 15:58.910
How I discipline her
is no concern of yours.

15:58.960 --> 16:00.900
She is my servant.

16:12.880 --> 16:14.870
Are you all right?

16:14.920 --> 16:17.270
I am a servant.

16:17.320 --> 16:20.550
As are you, Father.

16:20.600 --> 16:24.630
Fulfilling Madame Chania's
wishes is what pleases me.

16:24.680 --> 16:27.220
I do it willingly and gladly.

16:29.680 --> 16:32.920
But you are so much more
than just a servant.

16:35.400 --> 16:38.520
Forgive me, Father, but
I have things to do.

16:57.600 --> 17:00.750
Come with me on one
of my naturist walks.

17:00.800 --> 17:01.830
Oh, Syrus.

17:01.880 --> 17:04.430
It will make you feel alive.

17:04.480 --> 17:08.910
You know, you remind me
of a puppy I once had.

17:08.960 --> 17:11.150
A puppy?

17:11.200 --> 17:13.230
Always licking.

17:13.280 --> 17:17.720
Lick, lick, lick.

17:21.920 --> 17:23.790
Have you fixed it?

17:23.839 --> 17:26.910
Yes, it was just an oil leak.

17:26.960 --> 17:29.230
Well, you should go
immediately to the police.

17:29.280 --> 17:31.630
Ladies, I think you
should go with him.

17:31.680 --> 17:33.510
~ On that thing?
~ It's not safe to stay.

17:33.560 --> 17:35.150
But what about you, Father?

17:35.200 --> 17:36.830
I'll be fine until the police arrive.

17:36.880 --> 17:40.640
I thought I might go back up the
hill, where we found the blood.

17:44.320 --> 17:45.800
GUNSHOTS

17:48.880 --> 17:51.630
Pity that's not all
he has his sights on.

17:51.680 --> 17:55.910
You mean Mimi. Poor girl.

17:55.960 --> 17:59.990
Strange how people think they
can treat her as they please.

18:00.040 --> 18:02.950
Forget what the doctor said, Father.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.550
The occasional slap
keeps her in line.

18:05.600 --> 18:07.830
You said your passion
was giving pleasure.

18:07.880 --> 18:12.000
Why then would you
want to hurt someone?

18:17.000 --> 18:19.910
Getting some practice in, Father.

18:19.960 --> 18:22.190
The killer could strike again.

18:22.240 --> 18:23.430
Indeed.

18:23.480 --> 18:24.950
Care to join me?

18:25.000 --> 18:27.440
No, thank you.

18:28.880 --> 18:30.790
Drive carefully.

18:30.840 --> 18:33.310
I am not going on the back.

18:34.760 --> 18:38.350
Well, I can't get my legs that wide.

18:38.400 --> 18:41.000
Oh, you really are impossible.

18:56.920 --> 18:59.320
Can you tell me your name?

19:00.720 --> 19:02.720
Where are you from?

19:05.560 --> 19:07.320
Cuba.

19:23.440 --> 19:25.830
Oh, damn.

19:25.880 --> 19:28.680
Sorry, ladies.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.350
I'll check the garage for petrol.

19:33.400 --> 19:35.840
Won't be a moment.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.320
I am perfectly capable, thank you.

20:01.920 --> 20:03.350
Lady Felicia!

20:03.400 --> 20:05.080
Lady Felicia!

20:13.200 --> 20:15.550
Fire! Fire!

20:15.600 --> 20:17.030
Oh, hello!

20:17.080 --> 20:19.840
Fire! Fire! Fire!

20:21.520 --> 20:23.430
~ Fire.
~ What?

20:23.480 --> 20:25.040
Fire!

20:43.600 --> 20:46.750
We could have been killed.

20:46.800 --> 20:48.590
Yes.

20:48.640 --> 20:51.200
Thank you for saving my life!

20:54.960 --> 20:56.670
Are you all right?

20:56.720 --> 20:58.870
I think so.

20:58.920 --> 21:00.630
What happened?

21:00.680 --> 21:02.470
A leak in the petrol tank.

21:02.520 --> 21:04.910
Didn't you notice when
you repaired it?

21:04.960 --> 21:08.870
Someone must have punctured it
when I left it outside the hotel.

21:08.920 --> 21:12.910
It looks like the killer
doesn't want us to leave,

21:12.960 --> 21:15.680
until they're finished with us.

21:24.480 --> 21:26.550
Barashi is behind this!

21:26.600 --> 21:29.590
He hasn't even come out to
see what caused the explosion.

21:29.640 --> 21:32.190
~ That's just how he is.
~ No.

21:32.240 --> 21:34.980
I'm so pleased you're all right.

21:44.160 --> 21:45.960
Hey, Barashi.

21:50.560 --> 21:52.150
Take cover.

21:52.200 --> 21:53.750
Lord and his Holy Saints!

21:53.800 --> 21:55.630
~ Father!
~ The killer's out there.

21:55.680 --> 21:58.150
Get down.

21:58.200 --> 22:00.740
He was killed by his own gun.

22:06.640 --> 22:09.110
But the pistol was pointing
away from him.

22:09.160 --> 22:11.670
He wasn't killed by a bullet.

22:11.720 --> 22:16.070
The firing pin went backwards
into his forehead.

22:16.120 --> 22:17.710
So it was tampered with.

22:17.760 --> 22:19.110
Modified.

22:19.160 --> 22:23.000
Yes. The safety catch
has been removed.

22:24.600 --> 22:29.120
But how did the killer know Dr
Barashi would choose that pistol?

22:31.720 --> 22:35.070
They didn't. The killer
doesn't care who dies.

22:35.120 --> 22:37.790
So any one of us could be next.

22:40.360 --> 22:43.590
I think until the killer is caught,
we should stay together.

22:43.640 --> 22:46.430
Yes.

22:46.480 --> 22:48.670
I wonder who's doing it?

22:48.720 --> 22:52.750
I don't know, but I'm
sure it's not the Count.

22:52.800 --> 22:55.510
He seems very gentle.

22:55.560 --> 22:57.630
He's very taken with you.

22:57.680 --> 22:59.710
Nonsense.

22:59.760 --> 23:04.640
He's also very rich with
a title. You could do worse.

23:08.760 --> 23:12.190
Madame Chania, come away. The
killer could be out there.

23:12.240 --> 23:14.630
So you don't think it's one of us?

23:14.680 --> 23:17.420
Who knows? But better to be safe.

23:20.160 --> 23:22.430
Mimi told me to come up.

23:22.480 --> 23:26.470
All this killing has unnerved me.

23:26.520 --> 23:29.560
I'm scared to be alone.

23:43.160 --> 23:44.750
The Count, madame.

23:44.800 --> 23:46.940
You wanted to see me?

23:50.640 --> 23:52.550
I do not understand.

23:52.600 --> 23:54.030
I need to feel safe.

23:54.080 --> 23:58.440
And I've always found, well,
two men are better than one.

24:01.680 --> 24:02.950
Please!

24:03.000 --> 24:06.500
Syrus does not share
his women with anyone!

24:18.680 --> 24:20.800
"The Unholy Virgin".

24:22.760 --> 24:25.670
And "Vixens on Horseback".

24:25.720 --> 24:28.870
And "Hellcats of the Night".

24:28.920 --> 24:31.430
Father.

24:31.480 --> 24:32.990
Syrus.

24:33.040 --> 24:36.440
So what do you think
we should do, Father?

24:37.640 --> 24:40.990
Perhaps I should hike up
to the road, hitch a lift.

24:41.040 --> 24:42.350
Are you mad?

24:42.400 --> 24:45.070
Out in the open, the killer
could pick you off like that.

24:45.120 --> 24:47.200
Yes.

24:51.640 --> 24:53.990
Sounds like someone's
enjoying themselves.

24:54.040 --> 24:55.720
Indeed.

24:57.880 --> 25:00.620
I think I'll get some fresh air.

25:14.280 --> 25:17.230
Oh, thank goodness, you're here.

25:17.280 --> 25:18.590
Are you the proprietor?

25:18.640 --> 25:21.470
Yes, but how did you know to come?

25:21.520 --> 25:24.230
There's a young woman
with a gunshot wound.

25:24.280 --> 25:26.110
We thought she was from Cuba,

25:26.160 --> 25:27.750
but then I remembered this place.

25:27.800 --> 25:30.430
Actually, sir, it was my
idea. Local knowledge.

25:30.480 --> 25:32.150
Don't interrupt, Sergeant.

25:32.200 --> 25:33.950
As I was saying...

25:34.000 --> 25:35.470
Morning, Inspector.

25:35.520 --> 25:37.840
No, it can't be.

25:40.400 --> 25:42.520
Hmm, it is.

25:45.400 --> 25:46.950
The girl was local.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.630
And there's another
one by the cottage.

25:49.680 --> 25:51.710
~ Sorry?
~ But she's dead.

25:51.760 --> 25:52.950
There's a body?

25:53.000 --> 25:56.120
Actually, there's two.

26:04.280 --> 26:06.550
WHIMPERING

26:06.600 --> 26:08.910
What's that noise?

26:08.960 --> 26:12.040
It sounds like whimpering.

26:22.720 --> 26:25.520
SHE SCREAMS

26:29.560 --> 26:32.510
Oh, Inspector, thank heavens!

26:32.560 --> 26:34.390
What's happened?

26:34.440 --> 26:38.080
The maid. She's killed the Count.

26:43.800 --> 26:47.070
I just found him on the floor.

26:47.120 --> 26:48.950
Don't touch the weapon.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.270
Mimi.

26:50.320 --> 26:51.390
Your hands.

26:51.440 --> 26:54.030
I shook him to see if he was alive.

26:54.080 --> 26:55.310
Arrest her.

26:55.360 --> 26:57.150
But she is not capable!

26:57.200 --> 27:00.600
Father, please, they're
making a mistake.

27:02.800 --> 27:06.040
Straight down. It will help.

27:09.880 --> 27:11.630
Oh, the poor Count.

27:11.680 --> 27:13.070
Mrs McCarthy.

27:13.120 --> 27:17.280
Father, you must help her.
Mimi would not hurt a soul.

27:18.560 --> 27:21.350
Right. I need to take
statements from everyone.

27:21.400 --> 27:24.520
Let's start with you, Father.

27:26.200 --> 27:27.880
Silly me.

27:29.200 --> 27:31.340
Where are you off to?

27:37.840 --> 27:40.030
Is this your room, Father?

27:40.080 --> 27:41.950
Madame Chania's.

27:43.760 --> 27:48.200
The chandelier directly below shook
several times before you arrived.

27:52.840 --> 27:55.110
Have you gone barking mad?

27:55.160 --> 27:57.910
Drag marks.

27:57.960 --> 28:01.460
To the door that connects
with Mimi's room.

28:01.680 --> 28:04.470
So you think the Count
was murdered here,

28:04.520 --> 28:07.270
then his body was dragged
through there?

28:07.320 --> 28:09.000
Precisely.

28:16.640 --> 28:18.040
Blood?

28:22.680 --> 28:24.080
Father?

28:25.240 --> 28:28.150
Madame Chania, may I have
the key to this door?

28:28.200 --> 28:29.760
Of course.

28:33.840 --> 28:36.800
Must be in here somewhere.

28:38.720 --> 28:40.390
What's that?

28:45.320 --> 28:46.990
Safety catch.

28:48.200 --> 28:51.310
Like the one missing from the
pistol which killed the doctor.

28:51.360 --> 28:53.350
I've no idea how it got in there.

28:53.400 --> 28:56.030
I don't suppose you know
anything about this, do you?

28:56.080 --> 28:57.230
My lighter.

28:57.280 --> 28:58.870
I was wondering whose it was.

28:58.920 --> 29:03.430
I found it on the driveway
after the explosion.

29:03.480 --> 29:05.310
It doesn't make any sense.

29:05.360 --> 29:09.150
Madame Chania, I'm arresting
you on suspicion of murder.

29:09.200 --> 29:10.590
No!

29:10.640 --> 29:14.320
You're not obliged to
say... Madame Chania!

29:18.120 --> 29:19.630
Stop her, Sergeant!

29:19.680 --> 29:21.710
~ What are you doing?
~ Leave her alone.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.710
~ Mimi!
~ Let her go!

29:23.760 --> 29:25.760
Put her in the car.

29:27.360 --> 29:31.280
I'm releasing you without charge.
Don't leave the premises.

29:33.080 --> 29:37.070
I'll get you out. I promise.
I'll get you out.

29:37.120 --> 29:39.080
Come on.

29:41.200 --> 29:43.000
Come on.

29:48.640 --> 29:50.110
Sit down.

29:54.640 --> 29:56.870
I don't understand.

29:56.920 --> 29:59.400
I owe her everything.

30:01.480 --> 30:02.710
She used you.

30:02.760 --> 30:03.950
No!

30:04.000 --> 30:08.960
She gave me a life, took me off
the streets when I had nothing.

30:10.840 --> 30:16.320
~ Mimi...
~ And like you, I'd give up
my life for the one I serve.

30:18.000 --> 30:21.310
Father, I've arranged
a car to take you back.

30:21.360 --> 30:22.470
Thank you.

30:22.520 --> 30:24.750
But in the meantime, I
still need that statement.

30:24.800 --> 30:26.000
Now.

30:39.800 --> 30:43.600
I know, it's very upsetting.

30:45.600 --> 30:50.350
But Father Brown is right. Madame
Chania treated you appallingly.

30:50.400 --> 30:52.710
But what am I going
to do without her?

30:52.760 --> 30:55.190
You don't need her. You'll cope.

30:55.240 --> 30:56.470
No.

30:56.520 --> 30:58.310
Trust me, you will.

30:58.360 --> 31:00.830
But you mustn't blame yourself.

31:00.880 --> 31:03.350
You're worth more than that.

31:05.680 --> 31:07.390
You really think so?

31:07.440 --> 31:10.080
Yes, I do.

31:21.320 --> 31:23.190
Forgive me, I...

31:25.720 --> 31:27.470
She's just upset,

31:27.520 --> 31:30.960
and like all of us, has been
bewitched by Madame Chania.

31:54.040 --> 31:57.590
Those roses have been pruned
within an inch of their life.

31:57.640 --> 31:59.830
What would you know
about pruning roses?

31:59.880 --> 32:02.620
I know your mind's on the Count.

32:03.240 --> 32:04.710
He was just a stranger.

32:04.760 --> 32:08.230
Strangers can sometimes have
the deepest effect on us.

32:08.280 --> 32:11.790
The thrill of the
unknown. The danger.

32:11.840 --> 32:13.790
Nonsense.

32:13.840 --> 32:17.070
Well, it seems to me you can
look at this in one of two ways.

32:17.120 --> 32:19.710
You can either dwell
on what might have been,

32:19.760 --> 32:22.030
or you can cherish the memory.

32:22.080 --> 32:27.190
For a brief moment, somebody
made you feel special.

32:27.240 --> 32:29.200
Alive.

32:32.760 --> 32:35.080
I know that look.

32:36.600 --> 32:40.030
I have been racking my brains to
find a motive for the murders.

32:40.080 --> 32:42.150
Has Madame Chania confessed?

32:42.200 --> 32:45.830
Insists she's innocent,
but won't say any more.

32:45.880 --> 32:48.630
Well, I'm just glad to
be away from that hotel.

32:48.680 --> 32:52.790
Even before the murders, there
was so much ungodly behaviour.

32:52.840 --> 32:56.270
Indeed. That maid was...

32:56.320 --> 32:58.520
far too tactile.

33:00.360 --> 33:01.950
Oh!

33:02.000 --> 33:04.870
Madame Chania is the killer.

33:04.920 --> 33:06.630
But we already know that.

33:06.680 --> 33:08.470
Where are you off to?

33:08.520 --> 33:10.480
To hitch a ride!

33:44.600 --> 33:46.190
Father Brown.

33:46.240 --> 33:49.720
Ah. There you are.

33:51.400 --> 33:52.590
Going somewhere?

33:52.640 --> 33:54.840
I cannot bear to stay.

33:55.720 --> 33:58.910
But what brings you back, Father?

33:58.960 --> 34:00.840
Books.

34:03.680 --> 34:05.030
Books?

34:05.080 --> 34:07.830
Madame Chania said she
wasn't attracted to women,

34:07.880 --> 34:11.190
yet most of her novels appear
to be lesbian erotica.

34:11.239 --> 34:13.190
Rather odd.

34:13.239 --> 34:17.550
Unless you are the
real Madame Chania.

34:17.600 --> 34:19.989
What?

34:20.040 --> 34:23.429
You changed roles with your maid
before the guests arrived.

34:23.480 --> 34:25.830
You're not serious?

34:25.880 --> 34:28.469
Thus relinquishing
your hostess duties,

34:28.520 --> 34:31.469
you were free to roam the hotel

34:31.520 --> 34:35.120
at will, killing when
the opportunity arose.

34:35.600 --> 34:36.870
That's absurd.

34:36.920 --> 34:40.949
No doubt you told your maid
that the swap was some...

34:41.000 --> 34:43.630
hedonistic game.

34:43.679 --> 34:46.790
Father, you said yourself,
I was set up.

34:46.840 --> 34:51.750
In retrospect, it seemed too obvious.

34:51.800 --> 34:53.670
You were set up,

34:53.719 --> 34:55.389
by yourself.

34:57.600 --> 35:01.310
But you knew that someone was
bound to spot the glaring clues

35:01.360 --> 35:03.920
you had laid.

35:06.360 --> 35:10.640
And that they'd assume you were
framed by "Madame Chania."

35:11.720 --> 35:14.190
Making you above suspicion.

35:15.840 --> 35:18.750
You used her lighter
to start the fire

35:18.800 --> 35:22.190
and then planted the
safety catch in her bag.

35:22.240 --> 35:24.390
So I killed everyone?

35:24.440 --> 35:27.310
The Count, Dr Barashi,

35:27.360 --> 35:29.870
even the girl he hired?

35:29.920 --> 35:34.030
If the police hadn't arrived,
you'd have killed us all.

35:34.080 --> 35:39.070
Myself and my companions were,
like the girls, unwanted visitors,

35:39.120 --> 35:41.270
who had to be dealt with.

35:41.320 --> 35:44.000
But one of them got away.

35:49.600 --> 35:52.310
If all this were true, Father,

35:52.360 --> 35:56.150
don't you think the "real maid"
would have told the police

35:56.200 --> 35:58.140
her true identity?

36:02.480 --> 36:04.950
Not if you told her not to.

36:07.160 --> 36:12.120
Dr Barashi said he heard
Madame Chania slapping you.

36:13.640 --> 36:17.040
But it was the other
way round. Wasn't it?

36:18.720 --> 36:21.750
And when you said you'd give
your life for the one you serve,

36:21.800 --> 36:24.990
you were actually referring
to the way your maid

36:25.040 --> 36:26.920
felt about you.

36:29.240 --> 36:31.710
If only she knew the truth.

36:32.960 --> 36:34.500
The truth.

36:37.840 --> 36:40.230
The truth...

36:40.280 --> 36:43.600
is that I am not Madame Chania.

36:45.080 --> 36:48.080
Yes. I believe you.

36:52.560 --> 36:56.270
I expect Madame Chania
was a made-up name.

36:56.320 --> 36:58.750
Used to rent this hotel.

36:58.800 --> 37:01.270
So that after your killing spree,

37:01.320 --> 37:05.430
you could return to your
travels and your real name.

37:05.480 --> 37:11.430
So, if I am not Madame
Chania, who am I?

37:11.480 --> 37:13.910
Reading matter for the journey?

37:13.960 --> 37:16.310
German erotica,

37:16.360 --> 37:18.510
Lulu and Lucia,

37:18.560 --> 37:21.200
Business as Usual...

37:22.640 --> 37:25.040
African Safari.

37:26.440 --> 37:28.430
Big game hunter?

37:28.480 --> 37:31.480
Ah, but that's a man's sport, Father.

37:34.360 --> 37:39.070
I remember reading some time ago
in the National Geographic magazine

37:39.120 --> 37:43.190
about a white woman killing
things in Africa.

37:43.240 --> 37:45.670
What was her name?

37:45.720 --> 37:48.200
Madame Chania...

37:49.800 --> 37:52.350
.. is an anagram,

37:52.400 --> 37:55.750
of Ana Demiachia,

37:55.800 --> 37:58.470
the Italian huntress who has shot

37:58.520 --> 38:01.760
almost every living
creature on Earth.

38:10.600 --> 38:15.150
Finally! I just couldn't
resist a little clue.

38:15.200 --> 38:20.040
So, all your victims are trophies?

38:32.760 --> 38:34.520
Syrus.

39:05.400 --> 39:08.950
I'm going to give you a
sporting chance, Father,

39:09.000 --> 39:12.470
although you may be a little sluggish

39:12.520 --> 39:14.660
after the opium cake.

39:17.280 --> 39:20.670
Does killing give you pleasure?

39:20.720 --> 39:23.070
Ever since I was a child.

39:23.120 --> 39:24.870
So this was all planned?

39:24.920 --> 39:29.950
Meticulously. To lure strangers
to an isolated place.

39:30.000 --> 39:35.190
Multiple deaths, all
by my hand. Such power!

39:35.240 --> 39:37.390
But why pick those three men?

39:37.440 --> 39:42.550
I had to choose someone. Their
lack of ambition repulsed me.

39:42.600 --> 39:43.630
Ambition?

39:43.680 --> 39:47.310
They were obsessed by cheap,
meaningless thrills,

39:47.360 --> 39:49.110
lechery, gluttony.

39:49.160 --> 39:53.990
A true hedonist puts pleasure
before everything.

39:54.040 --> 39:56.950
Before another's pain.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.230
Another's life.

39:59.280 --> 40:01.710
People are just animals.

40:01.760 --> 40:03.830
And you're a different
kind of animal?

40:03.880 --> 40:08.270
Technically. I'm a
hedonistic existentialist.

40:08.320 --> 40:09.430
A what?

40:09.480 --> 40:15.200
I cope with the nightmare of
living with the joy of killing.

40:17.280 --> 40:21.350
When I load the last
bullet, the hunt begins,

40:21.400 --> 40:24.640
so you'd better run, Father.

40:27.200 --> 40:30.040
But watch out for my traps.

40:31.800 --> 40:36.520
Last one, Father, then I shoot you.

40:38.960 --> 40:43.000
Yes. I believe you will.

40:44.360 --> 40:46.510
Father Brown!

40:46.560 --> 40:48.630
Father Brown!

40:48.680 --> 40:50.880
I'm going to find you!

40:57.160 --> 40:58.880
Father!

41:01.440 --> 41:03.030
Father Brown!

41:03.080 --> 41:04.960
Father Brown!

41:09.360 --> 41:13.150
'You may be a little sluggish
after the opium cake.'

41:13.200 --> 41:14.470
Father!

41:14.520 --> 41:15.950
'Ana Demiachia.'

41:16.000 --> 41:17.510
Where are you hiding, Father?

41:17.560 --> 41:19.190
'Every living creature...'

41:19.240 --> 41:21.190
'Trophies.'

41:21.240 --> 41:22.590
I will find you, Father!

41:22.640 --> 41:24.870
'She's dead.'

41:24.920 --> 41:26.230
'People are just animals.'

41:26.280 --> 41:28.630
'Multiple deaths, all by my hand.'

41:28.680 --> 41:30.590
~ 'She's dead.'
~ 'Such power!'

41:30.640 --> 41:33.230
'But watch out for my traps.'

41:33.280 --> 41:34.830
SHE SCREAMS

41:34.880 --> 41:36.790
Help me!

41:36.840 --> 41:38.670
Father Brown!

41:38.720 --> 41:41.400
Help me, Father Brown!

42:06.600 --> 42:11.790
God said, "Let the Earth bring forth

42:11.840 --> 42:15.350
"the living creature in its kind,

42:15.400 --> 42:18.990
"the cattle, the creeping things,

42:19.040 --> 42:22.110
"and the beasts of the Earth,

42:22.160 --> 42:25.910
"each according to its kind."

42:25.960 --> 42:27.960
And it was so done.
