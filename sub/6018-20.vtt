00:02.369 --> 00:03.734
These pest-control companies...

00:05.071 --> 00:07.835
...call themselves exterminators,
but they can't really do it.

00:08.007 --> 00:11.774
The best they can do is get the bugs
to go to somebody else's house.

00:11.945 --> 00:13.936
They just relocate them.
You know what I mean?

00:14.114 --> 00:17.049
They're bug realtors
is what they are.

00:17.217 --> 00:20.778
"l think you'll be happy here. There's
a lot of crumbs, not much light.

00:21.221 --> 00:24.952
They usually sleep through the night,
so you'll have your run of the place."

00:25.291 --> 00:28.522
Nobody cares about killing insects.
Even animal-rights people don't care.

00:28.695 --> 00:31.323
You could probably walk
into an animal-rights meeting...

00:31.498 --> 00:32.726
...and hear a speech like:

00:32.899 --> 00:37.427
"The only way to stop the cruelty
of the scientific testing on animals--

00:37.604 --> 00:38.832
Got him.

00:39.005 --> 00:41.803
--is to boycott these companies."

00:48.148 --> 00:49.206
Anyway, it's funny.

00:49.382 --> 00:51.714
Paula and I actually met
because of Elaine.

00:51.885 --> 00:53.477
Elaine is in my drawing class.

00:53.653 --> 00:56.713
-And I went there one day to see--
-A nude model.

00:57.190 --> 00:59.556
--if Elaine wanted
to go get some coffee.

00:59.726 --> 01:02.058
You know, I once went out
with a nude model.

01:02.228 --> 01:04.458
Never let me see her naked.

01:04.631 --> 01:08.089
Hundreds of people see her naked
every week except me.

01:08.268 --> 01:10.099
Needless to say, it was quite vexing.

01:13.206 --> 01:14.798
-Are you through?
-Yeah.

01:16.676 --> 01:19.304
So I started to compliment Elaine
on her sketches...

01:19.479 --> 01:21.276
...and it turns out they're Paula's.

01:21.614 --> 01:23.946
George, I just like to doodle.

01:24.350 --> 01:26.580
Dropped my napkin.

01:26.753 --> 01:27.845
-Jerry.
-What?

01:28.021 --> 01:29.648
-What are you doing?
-What?

01:29.823 --> 01:32.587
She had those nuts in her mouth.
She just spit them out.

01:38.364 --> 01:40.594
You-- You ate these?

01:40.767 --> 01:43.167
You sucked on these
and then put them on the plate?

01:43.336 --> 01:45.395
Well, I didn't know
you were gonna eat them.

01:45.572 --> 01:47.233
Still.

01:47.807 --> 01:50.401
I'm sorry you find me so repulsive.

01:50.577 --> 01:53.603
No, no, I don't.
I mean, don't be silly.

01:53.780 --> 01:55.270
-Yeah.
-It's just....

01:55.448 --> 01:59.384
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I think I'll just go to the ladies' room.

01:59.552 --> 02:01.110
I'll join you.

02:02.355 --> 02:04.448
Oh, man, did you see that?

02:04.624 --> 02:07.320
I ate discarded food.

02:07.494 --> 02:10.793
-Well, I've done that.
-Yeah, but with you it's intentional.

02:11.197 --> 02:13.324
-Haven't you kissed her?
-But this is different.

02:13.500 --> 02:16.594
This is like semi-digested foodstuff.

02:16.769 --> 02:19.465
The next stop is the stomach,
and you can take it from there.

02:20.573 --> 02:21.972
Oh, excuse me. Just a second.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.406
Yeah, that's it.

02:24.844 --> 02:26.641
Yeah, that's gonna make
a big difference.

02:26.813 --> 02:29.714
Hey, this is dating.
You can't leave anything to chance.

02:29.883 --> 02:32.852
You think Shelly's upset that I made
a big deal about the pecan?

02:34.354 --> 02:35.343
Yeah.

02:35.822 --> 02:38.017
-Thanks.
-No problem.

02:38.191 --> 02:40.853
Well, Jerry, I guess
we should get going.

02:41.127 --> 02:42.116
Oh, boy.

02:42.295 --> 02:44.786
Well, it was very nice
meeting you, Shelly.

02:44.964 --> 02:48.331
And, Jerry, be careful,
there's a lot of nuts out there.

02:51.738 --> 02:52.864
Do you have everything?

02:53.039 --> 02:55.337
-Can you grab my purse?
-Yeah.

02:57.000 --> 03:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:06.152 --> 03:07.517
Yeah, so?

03:07.687 --> 03:09.712
-Don't you see what this is?
-It's a doodle.

03:09.889 --> 03:12.221
Yeah. A doodle of me.

03:12.392 --> 03:15.725
Look at the size of the nose, the ears.
All my features are distorted.

03:15.895 --> 03:18.193
Oh, it's an affectionate caricature.

03:18.998 --> 03:21.159
I'm grotesque.

03:21.334 --> 03:24.167
-I look like a troll.
-It's just a drawing.

03:24.571 --> 03:25.970
Don't you see what this says?

03:26.139 --> 03:29.438
How could you possibly like somebody
if you think they look like this?

03:30.743 --> 03:32.836
Hello!

03:33.780 --> 03:36.977
-What is with him?
-Usual.

03:37.317 --> 03:38.545
So you know what?

03:38.718 --> 03:42.313
My friend Judy recommended me
for a job at Viking Press.

03:42.488 --> 03:44.979
-Hey, good for you.
-Yeah, but get this:

03:45.158 --> 03:46.853
Viking has a deal
with the Plaza Hotel.

03:47.026 --> 03:49.859
They've got a two-bedroom suite there
for out-of-town clients.

03:50.029 --> 03:53.465
-So guess what I did?
-Oh, come on.

03:53.633 --> 03:56.568
You told them you were from
out of town just to stay in the hotel?

03:56.736 --> 03:59.864
I know. I know, Jerry,
but it's the Plaza.

04:00.039 --> 04:02.371
I've never stayed there.
It'll be like a vacation.

04:02.575 --> 04:05.669
Be sure to catch a Broadway show
while you're in town.

04:06.913 --> 04:09.279
Listen, I used your parents' address
in Florida.

04:09.449 --> 04:11.508
They're coming
into town tomorrow, by the way.

04:12.018 --> 04:15.419
-Hey, what's this?
-Don't ask.

04:16.055 --> 04:18.716
What, is it a drawing of Mr. Magoo?

04:20.226 --> 04:22.091
No, it's George.

04:27.467 --> 04:29.458
It is.

04:31.170 --> 04:33.434
Are you enjoying yourself?

04:33.773 --> 04:36.207
-I'm sorry.
-You see? You see?

04:36.376 --> 04:38.844
Listen, when is your next
drawing class?

04:39.012 --> 04:40.001
Tomorrow.

04:40.179 --> 04:42.409
-I want you to do me a favor.
-What?

04:42.582 --> 04:44.812
I want you to find out
if she likes me.

04:44.984 --> 04:47.612
Find out if she likes you?
What, are you in high school?

04:48.021 --> 04:50.888
George, come on. Can't you just,
like, talk to her yourself?

04:51.057 --> 04:54.458
Then she's gonna know that I like her
more than she likes me.

04:54.627 --> 04:56.686
My parents are coming,
and I've gotta clean up.

04:56.863 --> 04:59.491
So if you and Potsie
are done scheming....

05:06.039 --> 05:08.030
Well, they're in.

05:08.207 --> 05:11.005
-What's in?
-The Mackinaw peaches, Jerry.

05:11.177 --> 05:13.975
The Mackinaw peaches!

05:15.081 --> 05:18.812
Right, the ones from Oregon that are
only ripe for two weeks a year?

05:18.985 --> 05:21.215
Yeah, that's right.
I split a case with Newman.

05:21.387 --> 05:23.014
I wait all year for these.

05:23.189 --> 05:25.919
Oh, this is fantastic.

05:26.359 --> 05:27.951
Makes your taste buds come alive.

05:28.127 --> 05:29.924
It's like having a circus
in your mouth.

05:31.097 --> 05:32.291
-Take a taste.
-No.

05:32.465 --> 05:33.830
-Take a taste.
-I don't want it.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.299
-Come on, just take a taste.
-I don't want it!

05:38.604 --> 05:40.037
I'm not gonna taste your peach.

05:40.206 --> 05:42.868
I ate someone's pecan last night.
I'm not eating your peach.

05:43.042 --> 05:46.978
Jerry, this is a miracle of nature
that exists for a brief period.

05:47.146 --> 05:50.274
It's like the aurora borealis.

05:53.853 --> 05:55.787
-Holy cow, what is this?
-What?

05:55.955 --> 05:58.856
-I think I got flea bites.
-Flea bites?

05:59.025 --> 06:01.619
Yeah. Look at this.
My ankle's all bitten up.

06:02.628 --> 06:04.755
You got a dog?

06:05.798 --> 06:07.095
No.

06:08.334 --> 06:10.097
Well, that is strange.

06:10.670 --> 06:11.932
How can I have fleas?

06:12.305 --> 06:14.796
Don't sweat it, buddy.
I used to have fleas.

06:14.974 --> 06:18.273
-What did you do about them?
-What do you mean?

06:18.444 --> 06:20.810
-Hey, Jerry. How you doing?
-Hey!

06:20.980 --> 06:23.505
-Kramer.
-Hi, Jerry.

06:23.850 --> 06:25.943
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

06:26.119 --> 06:28.212
Jerry, I'm your mother.
Now, what is it?

06:28.388 --> 06:30.049
Mom, Dad...

06:30.223 --> 06:32.248
...I have fleas.

06:34.127 --> 06:36.721
Paula, I hear you've been going out
with George Costanza.

06:37.296 --> 06:40.595
-How did you know?
-Everybody knows.

06:40.767 --> 06:43.736
George told me he thinks
you're totally cute and everything.

06:43.903 --> 06:45.928
He said that?

06:46.739 --> 06:50.368
-Do you like George?
-Yeah. He's cool.

06:52.011 --> 06:55.811
No, I mean, do you like him
or do you "like him" like him?

06:56.949 --> 07:00.476
"Like" like. Looks aren't
that important to me, you know?

07:00.653 --> 07:03.713
Ms. Benes, are you chewing gum?

07:16.769 --> 07:19.932
Yep. They're in your bedroom too,
Mr. Seinfeld.

07:20.106 --> 07:23.269
You got a full-blown outbreak of fleas
on your hands.

07:23.543 --> 07:26.273
I don't get it. How did this happen?
I don't have a dog.

07:26.446 --> 07:31.110
I don't explain them, Mr. Seinfeld.
I just exterminate them.

07:31.551 --> 07:33.018
I don't understand this.

07:33.186 --> 07:35.848
I'm gonna have to seal the place up
for 48 hours and fog it.

07:36.022 --> 07:37.319
Only way to get rid of them.

07:37.824 --> 07:40.520
Nobody can be in here for 48 hours?
I got my parents in town.

07:41.294 --> 07:44.024
Well, unless you wanna kill them...

07:44.197 --> 07:46.256
...they can't stay in here.

07:46.432 --> 07:48.525
This stuff is pretty toxic.

07:48.701 --> 07:52.330
-I'll go get my stuff. It's in the truck.
-Okay.

07:52.872 --> 07:55.602
-How you doing?
-Hi.

07:56.209 --> 07:58.074
Bug guy.

07:58.244 --> 08:00.804
-Why do you have a bug guy?
-I have fleas.

08:01.914 --> 08:03.279
Fleas?

08:03.449 --> 08:05.314
-How did you get fleas?
-I don't know.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.680
Everyone's gotta clear
the apartment for two days.

08:07.854 --> 08:09.651
I don't know what to do
with my parents.

08:09.822 --> 08:11.517
They'll never let me pay for a hotel.

08:11.691 --> 08:14.489
If they go someplace on their own,
it'll be some awful dump.

08:15.194 --> 08:16.991
Have you checked
into the Plaza yet?

08:17.163 --> 08:18.687
No.

08:18.865 --> 08:19.889
Oh, no.

08:20.066 --> 08:22.193
-Come on, come on, come on.
-Oh, no, no, no.

08:22.368 --> 08:24.996
-My parents, my parents.
-No, no, no-- Okay!

08:25.171 --> 08:27.002
Good.

08:28.541 --> 08:29.530
-Yeah.
-<i>Yeah.</i>

08:29.709 --> 08:30.903
Come up.

08:31.077 --> 08:33.341
What about you?
Where are you gonna stay?

08:33.513 --> 08:35.879
I'm gonna ask Shelly,
but she still might be upset...

08:36.048 --> 08:38.448
...about the masticated
pecan incident.

08:38.885 --> 08:41.785
Hey, I found out from Paula,
she likes George.

08:41.953 --> 08:45.947
-I bet he'll be relieved.
-When he's dead, he'll be relieved.

08:46.559 --> 08:49.221
By the way, Viking Press sent
a FedEx for you to my parents.

08:49.395 --> 08:50.555
They brought it with them.

08:50.730 --> 08:53.460
Yeah, that's just some stuff
about the company.

08:55.234 --> 08:57.759
-Hey, did you talk to Paula?
-Yeah.

08:57.937 --> 09:01.930
-So, what did she say?
-She likes you.

09:02.575 --> 09:03.769
She said she liked me?

09:03.943 --> 09:05.410
-She said that?
-Yep.

09:05.578 --> 09:08.012
Those were her exact words,
"l like George"?

09:08.180 --> 09:09.943
Yep.

09:10.116 --> 09:12.016
How do you like that?
How do you like that?

09:12.184 --> 09:16.211
You see, I get myself into a tizzy,
I'm all worked up, and for what?

09:16.422 --> 09:17.548
For nothing.

09:17.723 --> 09:19.782
In fact, she said looks
weren't that important.

09:19.959 --> 09:22.120
You see-- What?

09:28.668 --> 09:30.158
She said...?

09:30.336 --> 09:33.134
She said looks aren't
that important to her?

09:34.006 --> 09:37.464
-Let me rephrase that. She--
-She thinks I'm ugly.

09:37.643 --> 09:39.270
I knew it.

09:40.580 --> 09:41.808
See, the thing of it is...

09:42.148 --> 09:44.742
...there's a lot of ugly people
out there walking around...

09:44.917 --> 09:48.250
...but they don't know they're ugly
because nobody actually tells them.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.015
So, what's your point?

09:52.191 --> 09:53.522
-I don't-- I don't know.
-Okay.

09:53.693 --> 09:58.096
The point, George, is she likes you.

09:58.264 --> 09:59.663
Oh, so what?

09:59.832 --> 10:02.426
I'd rather she hate me
and thought I was good-looking.

10:02.602 --> 10:05.503
Then at least I could get
somebody else.

10:06.305 --> 10:09.570
-What is this? Why am I itching?
-That would be the fleas.

10:14.280 --> 10:17.909
-Hey.
-Hey, how do you like this?

10:18.551 --> 10:20.382
Oh, my God.

10:20.553 --> 10:22.680
Morty, let's go. This is too nice.

10:22.855 --> 10:26.450
Hey, this is the kind of room
Sinatra stays in.

10:26.626 --> 10:30.289
Hey, look, macadamia nuts.

10:30.463 --> 10:31.862
-Macadamia nuts?
-Yeah.

10:32.031 --> 10:34.659
You know what these cost?
They're like 80 cents a nut.

10:35.334 --> 10:38.599
-Are you sure this is all right?
-Yeah. It's all taken care of.

10:38.771 --> 10:42.537
Hey, they got a phone
in the john here.

10:45.578 --> 10:46.567
Judy.

10:46.746 --> 10:47.974
-Hey.
-Hi.

10:48.147 --> 10:50.240
Thank you for recommending me
to Viking Press.

10:50.416 --> 10:54.147
It is my pleasure. Just make sure
you give that manuscript a good read.

10:54.320 --> 10:55.412
Manuscript?

10:55.755 --> 10:58.019
Yeah, I'm sure they FedExed you
a manuscript.

10:58.190 --> 11:00.317
They want to see you read
an unpublished work...

11:00.493 --> 11:03.018
...and give insightful criticism.

11:03.195 --> 11:04.628
Read it twice if you have to.

11:04.797 --> 11:08.995
-This is a big step in your career.
-Yeah, I gotta go.

11:09.168 --> 11:11.432
-Hey, what about lunch?
-I gotta go.

11:13.305 --> 11:15.432
-Thank God I found you.
-Oh, hey.

11:15.608 --> 11:17.041
Do you still have that FedEx?

11:17.209 --> 11:19.973
In the apartment. But we can't go in.
It's being fumigated.

11:20.146 --> 11:23.013
I'll take my chances.
Come on, come on.

11:25.351 --> 11:28.184
-You see?
-Jerry, I need that FedEx right now.

11:28.354 --> 11:29.685
I told you to take it.

11:29.855 --> 11:32.585
I didn't know that it was a manuscript
that I had to read.

11:32.758 --> 11:36.057
Well, you can't go in there.
It's like a gas chamber in there.

11:36.829 --> 11:38.820
Hey, buddy.

11:38.998 --> 11:41.057
I left a Mackinaw peach
in your refrigerator.

11:41.267 --> 11:44.202
Kramer, they're fumigating.
There's toxic gas in there.

11:44.770 --> 11:47.330
-Toxic gas?
-Oh, you'll be fine.

11:47.506 --> 11:50.771
-You were there a couple minutes?
-An hour and a half.

11:51.043 --> 11:53.534
I was reading a manuscript.
I just couldn't put it down.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.704
-My manuscript?
-How do you feel?

11:55.881 --> 11:58.907
Well, now that you mention it,
a little woozy.

11:59.085 --> 12:01.178
You've gotta go back in
and grab my manuscript.

12:01.353 --> 12:03.753
-I'm not going back.
-All right, then where is it?

12:03.923 --> 12:06.949
I left it on the coffee table
or something.

12:07.226 --> 12:09.319
-What are you doing?
-I'm going in.

12:10.463 --> 12:12.021
Didn't you see the sign
on the door?

12:12.198 --> 12:14.496
I thought it was so your parents
wouldn't walk in...

12:14.667 --> 12:16.259
...while you were with a girl.

12:44.230 --> 12:47.097
It's not on any table, Kramer.
Where is it?

12:47.266 --> 12:49.757
I don't know.
I was in the bathroom, the kitchen.

12:49.935 --> 12:52.096
Okay, bathroom, kitchen.

12:52.271 --> 12:54.171
Could you get me a soda?

12:55.674 --> 12:58.609
Jerry, I had some milk.
I made a sandwich.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.144
I gotta get out of the building.

13:19.298 --> 13:21.892
I couldn't find it anywhere.

13:22.067 --> 13:24.763
-How did you get fleas anyway?
-I don't know.

13:24.937 --> 13:26.632
Who could have been
in my apartment?

13:26.806 --> 13:27.898
I looked everywhere...

13:28.073 --> 13:30.871
...but all I could find were these
stupid Chunky wrappers.

13:31.043 --> 13:33.534
Wait a second.
Did you say Chunky wrappers?

13:33.712 --> 13:35.145
-Yeah.
-Let me see those.

13:38.217 --> 13:43.245
Oh, I know the chunky
that left these Chunkys.

13:43.489 --> 13:45.184
Newman!

13:45.357 --> 13:47.689
I've got him.

13:52.698 --> 13:56.429
Newman! Open the door, Newman.
I know you're in there.

13:58.003 --> 14:00.198
Hello, Jerry.

14:00.773 --> 14:02.331
What a pleasant surprise.

14:02.508 --> 14:04.874
There's nothing pleasant about it.
Just cut the crap.

14:05.044 --> 14:07.706
You gave me fleas.
I know it and you know it.

14:07.880 --> 14:10.144
Fleas?

14:10.316 --> 14:14.514
That's preposterous.
How could I give you fleas?

14:14.687 --> 14:18.020
-Now, if you don't mind--
-Oh, but I do.

14:18.190 --> 14:22.456
There's probably fleas
crawling all over your little snack bar.

14:25.598 --> 14:27.862
So you have fleas.

14:28.033 --> 14:30.900
Maybe you keep your house
in a state of disrepair.

14:31.070 --> 14:33.095
Maybe you live in squalor.

14:33.272 --> 14:35.968
You know, Newman,
the thing about fleas...

14:36.141 --> 14:39.838
...is that they irritate the skin.

14:40.012 --> 14:42.003
And they start to itch.

14:42.181 --> 14:45.378
Oh, maybe you can hold out
five seconds or 10.

14:45.551 --> 14:47.951
Maybe 15 or 20.

14:48.120 --> 14:49.883
But after a while...

14:50.055 --> 14:52.990
...no matter how much willpower
a person may have...

14:53.158 --> 14:54.216
...it won't matter...

14:54.393 --> 14:58.329
...because they're crawling,
crawling on your skin.

14:58.497 --> 15:01.227
Up your legs, up your spine,
up your back--

15:01.400 --> 15:04.961
All right, I've got them!
I'm rife with fleas!

15:07.973 --> 15:09.304
Oh, that feels good.

15:09.475 --> 15:11.875
Hey, this guy charges
100 bucks an hour...

15:12.044 --> 15:14.774
...but I'm telling you,
he's worth every penny.

15:14.947 --> 15:16.107
I'm next.

15:16.282 --> 15:19.740
Hey, Leo, get this.
I'm watching four movies at once.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.853
Pay-per-view.

15:22.021 --> 15:23.852
I love these nuts.

15:24.023 --> 15:27.220
This champagne's gone flat.

15:28.327 --> 15:30.727
Nana.

15:30.963 --> 15:34.160
Let the chambermaid clean it up.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.998
-Hello.
-What's the matter?

15:39.505 --> 15:42.099
-Well, I spoke to Elaine--
-Hey, look, no shave.

15:42.274 --> 15:44.765
No. Why should that make
any difference to you?

15:44.944 --> 15:45.968
It doesn't.

15:46.145 --> 15:48.272
Of course not.
You don't care what I look like.

15:48.614 --> 15:50.138
That's right, I don't.

15:50.316 --> 15:53.012
I suppose I could pull this out
and walk around like this...

15:53.185 --> 15:54.413
...and you wouldn't care.

15:54.586 --> 15:56.281
Not a whit.

15:57.389 --> 15:59.220
I suppose we could go
to Lincoln Center...

15:59.391 --> 16:01.382
...and I could wear
sneakers and jeans.

16:01.560 --> 16:04.427
-You could wear sweatpants.
-I could?

16:04.596 --> 16:09.158
You could drape yourself in velvet
for all I care.

16:11.003 --> 16:12.834
Velvet?

16:15.874 --> 16:17.671
-Did you read the whole thing?
-Oh, yeah.

16:17.843 --> 16:19.367
Yeah? So, what's it about?

16:19.545 --> 16:21.410
Well, it's a story...

16:21.580 --> 16:25.573
...about love, deception,
greed, lust...

16:25.751 --> 16:28.686
...and unbridled enthusiasm.

16:29.355 --> 16:31.186
Unbridled enthusiasm?

16:31.357 --> 16:33.655
That's what led
to Billy Mumphrey's downfall.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.020
Oh, boy.

16:35.194 --> 16:39.028
You see, Elaine,
Billy was a simple country boy...

16:39.198 --> 16:42.361
...you might say
a cockeyed optimist...

16:42.534 --> 16:44.968
...who got himself mixed up
in the high-stakes game...

16:45.137 --> 16:47.503
...of world diplomacy
and international intrigue.

16:48.707 --> 16:50.937
-Oh, my God.
-Well, here we go.

16:51.110 --> 16:53.772
Could I have a Scotch on the rocks?

16:54.179 --> 16:55.441
-May l?
-Yeah, go ahead.

16:55.614 --> 16:57.104
All right.

16:57.449 --> 16:58.848
What is this?

16:59.018 --> 17:02.181
-What? What are you--?
-I can't taste this.

17:02.354 --> 17:05.721
-What are you talking about?
-Well, this food, it has no taste.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.357
Nothing. I'm getting nothing.

17:08.527 --> 17:10.256
What?

17:10.829 --> 17:13.627
It must be the toxic gas
from the fumigation.

17:13.799 --> 17:15.232
What?

17:22.641 --> 17:25.804
-Thanks for letting me stay here.
-I don't keep pecans in the house...

17:25.978 --> 17:28.242
...so I didn't think there would
be a problem.

17:28.414 --> 17:29.574
Oh, damn.

17:29.748 --> 17:32.114
-What's the matter?
-I forgot my toothbrush.

17:32.284 --> 17:34.184
Oh, no problem.

17:34.353 --> 17:35.547
You can use mine.

17:36.088 --> 17:37.817
Yours?

17:37.990 --> 17:39.582
You know what? I'll brush later.

17:39.758 --> 17:42.226
Brush now.

17:45.164 --> 17:46.825
Sure.

17:56.575 --> 17:58.907
Newman, let me have a bite
of your Mackinaw.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.876
-What for, you got your own.
-Come on, I need to taste it.

18:02.047 --> 18:03.742
Yeah.

18:05.918 --> 18:08.751
Nothing. I can't even taste
a Mackinaw.

18:08.921 --> 18:11.890
-Well, that's a shame.
-Wait all year, and I can't taste them.

18:12.057 --> 18:14.150
You can't taste them,
why waste them?

18:14.326 --> 18:16.692
Why not give them all to me?

18:18.464 --> 18:22.833
It's a story about love, deception...

18:23.001 --> 18:26.835
...greed, lust...

18:27.172 --> 18:30.539
...and unbridled enthusiasm.

18:30.709 --> 18:33.200
Unbridled enthusiasm?

18:33.378 --> 18:35.710
Yeah, yeah. That's right.

18:35.881 --> 18:41.478
That's what led to
Billy Mumphrey's downfall.

18:42.588 --> 18:44.579
Interesting take.

18:44.756 --> 18:47.384
So you believe that
had he not been so enthusiastic...

18:47.559 --> 18:49.959
...he could have averted disaster.

18:50.562 --> 18:53.053
Yes. Yes, that's right.

18:53.232 --> 18:54.563
You see....

18:54.733 --> 18:57.964
You see, Billy Mumphrey
was a simple country boy...

18:58.137 --> 19:00.697
...some might say
a cockeyed optimist...

19:00.873 --> 19:03.899
...who got caught
up in the dirty game...

19:04.076 --> 19:07.842
...of world diplomacy
and international intrigue.

19:08.013 --> 19:11.813
So it was more a question of attitude
than politics.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.452
Yes. Yes, Mr. Mandel.

19:16.722 --> 19:19.316
Hey, <i>Under Siege</i> is on again.

19:19.491 --> 19:21.049
Who's up for it?

19:22.494 --> 19:24.826
No more nuts.

19:36.542 --> 19:38.874
Oh, my God.

19:39.044 --> 19:42.036
What the hell is this?

19:42.848 --> 19:46.477
Don't tell me. Velvet?

19:46.752 --> 19:49.220
It's the real deal.

19:49.655 --> 19:51.520
She's seen you in this thing?

19:51.690 --> 19:55.251
That's right. We just had sex.

19:57.162 --> 20:01.292
You know, Jerry, I've been searching
for someone a long time.

20:01.466 --> 20:03.559
Well, the search is over.

20:03.735 --> 20:06.727
And now the search
for the right psychiatrist begins.

20:08.674 --> 20:10.369
So, what's with the suitcase?

20:11.210 --> 20:12.404
She threw me out.

20:12.578 --> 20:15.547
-Why?
-I wouldn't use her toothbrush.

20:16.148 --> 20:21.176
-So where you staying?
-I guess I'm stuck with the Velvet Fog.

20:22.754 --> 20:27.157
Three hours of massage time,
12 in-room movies...

20:27.326 --> 20:30.784
...including several adult features...

20:31.129 --> 20:33.495
...five shoeshines...

20:33.665 --> 20:36.031
...and $400 worth of snacks.

20:36.201 --> 20:38.567
Not to mention the damage
to the room.

20:38.737 --> 20:42.434
Mr. Mandel, you don't understand.
My friend had fleas.

20:42.608 --> 20:44.838
I ran into the gas.
It could have killed me.

20:45.010 --> 20:47.410
My other friend couldn't taste
his peaches.

20:47.579 --> 20:49.843
They're only good for two weeks.

20:50.549 --> 20:55.009
I think you've read one too many
Billy Mumphrey stories.

20:55.187 --> 20:58.418
-Good day, Ms. Benes.
-Okay, good day.

21:07.132 --> 21:08.759
-Hi, George.
-Hi.

21:08.934 --> 21:11.061
This is fantastic.

21:12.137 --> 21:14.697
-Ever had a Mackinaw peach?
-Oh, yeah. I love those.

21:14.873 --> 21:18.001
Well, too bad. It's all done.

21:34.159 --> 21:37.526
Yes. Yes, it's back.
I can taste again.

21:37.696 --> 21:38.993
-What's the date?
-Fifteenth.

21:39.164 --> 21:42.827
Fifteenth. Yes! Last day for
the Mackinaws. I can still make it.

21:43.268 --> 21:45.759
Wait, Newman. Newman, wait.

21:45.937 --> 21:48.337
Sorry. Last one.

21:48.507 --> 21:50.168
But if you want to suck the pit....

21:54.112 --> 21:57.138
Look, Beauford. It's the mailman.

21:57.949 --> 21:59.849
You remember the mailman,
don't you?

22:00.018 --> 22:02.179
-Kramer, don't.
-Get him!

22:24.343 --> 22:26.504
Hello? Is anybody here--?

22:33.018 --> 22:35.316
They said they were sending over
an Asian woman.

22:36.088 --> 22:38.283
Oh, my God.
