WEBVTT

00:14.275 --> 00:17.060
Nuh-uh.
No, no, no.

00:17.060 --> 00:19.193
10 minutes, okay?
And then we're going up.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.993
Mom?

00:40.518 --> 00:42.042
Mom?

00:47.569 --> 00:52.313
Adam!

00:52.313 --> 00:54.054
Mack, I want you
to do me a favor.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.359
You go get your mom a glass
of water

00:55.359 --> 00:57.187
in the kitchen, right now.
Go, go, go.

01:02.801 --> 01:04.194
Kim?
Kim?

01:08.372 --> 01:09.939
Kim, can you look at me?

01:09.939 --> 01:11.506
Kim.

01:11.506 --> 01:13.551
Please.
- Hey, look at me.

01:13.551 --> 01:14.900
Look at me. Look at me.
Look at me.

01:14.900 --> 01:15.901
What's going on?
Talk to me.

01:15.901 --> 01:16.902
There's a shot, Adam.

01:16.902 --> 01:18.121
I heard a shot.

01:18.121 --> 01:19.775
That was a car backfiring.

01:19.775 --> 01:21.081
It's a car outside.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.691
I heard the same thing.

01:22.691 --> 01:23.996
Just take a breath.
Take a breath.

01:23.996 --> 01:26.129
You're okay.

01:26.129 --> 01:27.739
Can you breathe?
Can you take a breath?

01:27.739 --> 01:29.132
Take a deep breath.
You're here with me.

01:29.132 --> 01:31.047
It's okay.

01:31.047 --> 01:32.179
Thanks, kiddo.

01:32.179 --> 01:33.876
Everything's fine.

01:33.876 --> 01:35.138
Mom's just not feeling well.

01:35.138 --> 01:36.226
Why don't you go
get ready for bed?

01:36.226 --> 01:37.445
I'm gonna be up
in a minute, okay?

01:37.445 --> 01:38.968
All right.
Go on, now.

01:40.883 --> 01:41.840
What is happening?

01:48.151 --> 01:50.414
Kim, just keep
breathing, now.

01:58.727 --> 02:00.468
It does sound
like your partner had a point.

02:00.468 --> 02:04.559
That sounds very scary.

02:04.559 --> 02:06.648
Yeah.

02:06.648 --> 02:10.739
I don't want to scare
my daughter, or him.

02:10.739 --> 02:13.698
So I'm here.

02:13.698 --> 02:16.136
And how long have you
been having these episodes?

02:22.664 --> 02:24.622
Um...

02:27.799 --> 02:32.804
Look, uh, I've been a cop
for ten years now.

02:32.804 --> 02:37.287
And, uh, I mean,
I've been through a lot.

02:37.287 --> 02:41.248
I was shot about a year ago,
almost bled out.

02:41.248 --> 02:44.468
It was six hours of my life.

02:44.468 --> 02:46.601
I've had--I've had
so many hours since then.

02:46.601 --> 02:49.212
And I've--I've dealt with it.

02:49.212 --> 02:51.388
I've been fine.
I have been.

02:51.388 --> 02:53.173
You don't need
to convince me of anything.

02:53.173 --> 02:54.478
I'm not.

02:54.478 --> 02:56.306
I'm just saying that
I've been all right.

02:56.306 --> 02:59.831
Um, I think a case a while back

02:59.831 --> 03:03.008
brought the shooting back up
for me, in some way.

03:03.008 --> 03:05.054
And, um, I'm here,

03:05.054 --> 03:08.231
and I wanna deal with it
and go back to being fine.

03:08.231 --> 03:10.059
Hmm.

03:18.328 --> 03:20.461
Am I supposed to fill
the silence?

03:22.898 --> 03:25.509
What do you know
about post-traumatic stress?

03:29.252 --> 03:31.341
CPD requires us
to know a certain amount.

03:31.341 --> 03:33.256
And my daughter has been
through trauma.

03:33.256 --> 03:35.476
So...

03:35.476 --> 03:37.782
But like I said,
I've been fine.

03:37.782 --> 03:39.523
The thing is,
post-traumatic stress

03:39.523 --> 03:42.091
isn't always shaking
on the ground, panicking,

03:42.091 --> 03:43.788
because a car backfired.
- Mm-hmm.

03:43.788 --> 03:46.226
Oftentimes, it's
the narrowing of a life.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.445
It can be making
your life small,

03:48.445 --> 03:50.273
making your life manageable,

03:50.273 --> 03:53.711
making decisions out of a fear
you don't even know is there.

03:53.711 --> 03:56.366
It can be the pushing away
of people you love,

03:56.366 --> 03:59.761
a feeling of numbness,
the absence of joy.

03:59.761 --> 04:02.329
Feeling cut off from the world.

04:02.329 --> 04:04.983
Trauma has a way of trapping
you without you even knowing

04:04.983 --> 04:07.812
it's sitting there,
right on top of your body,

04:07.812 --> 04:10.902
weighing you down until
something makes you notice,

04:10.902 --> 04:12.164
until a car backfires,

04:12.164 --> 04:13.775
and you're shaking
on the ground, panicking,

04:13.775 --> 04:15.777
because you feel like you've
just been shot again.

04:19.607 --> 04:21.391
Is that what happened?

04:32.184 --> 04:34.883
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:34.883 --> 04:36.145
What are you doing here?

04:36.145 --> 04:38.539
Thought I'd give you a ride.
How'd it go?

04:38.539 --> 04:40.105
Oh, it was fine.

04:40.105 --> 04:41.106
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

04:41.106 --> 04:42.282
Do you like her?

04:42.282 --> 04:44.109
Sure.
She's nice enough.

04:44.109 --> 04:46.242
Did she think it was,
like, some sort of flashback,

04:46.242 --> 04:49.289
something like that?

04:49.289 --> 04:50.507
Don't look at me like that.

04:50.507 --> 04:53.031
I'm not trying to press you.

04:53.031 --> 04:54.337
I need you to talk to me.

04:54.337 --> 04:56.165
I need to understand
what's going on.

04:56.165 --> 04:57.514
Kim, that was scary.

04:57.514 --> 05:00.735
It happened right
in front of Mack, okay?

05:00.735 --> 05:03.303
Just don't push me
away, please.

05:15.184 --> 05:16.577
CPD, move out of the way.

05:16.577 --> 05:19.580
- He's got a gun!
- Where?

05:19.580 --> 05:21.408
I didn't see his face,
but he's got a black jacket.

05:21.408 --> 05:23.888
Is everyone okay?

05:23.888 --> 05:25.499
Anybody hit?

05:47.259 --> 05:48.478
Excuse me. Sorry.

05:50.741 --> 05:51.742
Excuse me.

05:51.742 --> 05:52.961
Sorry.

06:00.534 --> 06:03.188
Sir!
Sir, are you injured?

06:03.188 --> 06:04.451
Sir!

06:04.451 --> 06:05.669
Adam, get on the train!
<i>- Doors closing.</i>

06:05.669 --> 06:08.063
On the train!
On the train!

06:22.425 --> 06:24.035
Hey.
Victim got on the train.

06:24.035 --> 06:25.036
He's a kid.

06:25.036 --> 06:26.168
He can't be more
than, like, 18.

06:26.168 --> 06:27.299
Think I saw a GSW to the chest.

06:27.299 --> 06:28.388
Did the offender
get on the train?

06:28.388 --> 06:29.432
No, I don't have eyes on him.

06:29.432 --> 06:31.478
All right, me neither. Okay.

06:31.478 --> 06:32.696
You go help the kid.

06:32.696 --> 06:34.698
I'll call 911,
go talk to the conductor,

06:34.698 --> 06:36.483
make sure he stays
at the next stop, all right?

06:44.316 --> 06:45.883
Hi.
Excuse me.

06:45.883 --> 06:47.363
You see a guy who was injured?

06:47.363 --> 06:49.583
No, no.
I didn't.

06:49.583 --> 06:51.628
Yeah, that's right.
Headed northbound.

06:51.628 --> 06:54.414
Advise any CTA personnel
to get to that platform.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.546
Roll an ambo.
Hold on one sec.

07:01.986 --> 07:02.987
Chicago PD.

07:02.987 --> 07:04.380
Anybody see a kid
who was injured?

07:04.380 --> 07:06.077
He just got on.
- Yeah, over here.

07:09.341 --> 07:10.255
He had blood on his shirt.

07:10.255 --> 07:11.256
He didn't seem okay.

07:11.256 --> 07:15.086
What--what's going on?

07:15.086 --> 07:16.436
Hey!

07:16.436 --> 07:18.307
Chicago Police.

07:18.307 --> 07:20.309
I'm gonna help you, okay?

07:20.309 --> 07:21.484
Buddy.
Buddy, you're hurt.

07:23.355 --> 07:24.661
Come on, come on.
Hey, look at me.

07:24.661 --> 07:25.880
We're going inside, okay?

07:25.880 --> 07:28.665
Please, I--
I need police.

07:28.665 --> 07:29.971
Please, I--
- I got you.

07:29.971 --> 07:31.755
- I need police.
- I got you.

07:31.755 --> 07:32.887
I--I--

07:32.887 --> 07:34.497
You've got me, buddy.
Come on.

07:34.497 --> 07:36.630
- I need--
- Oh, my God, is he shot?

07:36.630 --> 07:38.109
Hey, hey.

07:41.635 --> 07:44.464
You're all right.

07:44.464 --> 07:47.249
He's here.

07:47.249 --> 07:48.598
He's here?

07:48.598 --> 07:49.599
Hey, hey.
The man who shot you.

07:49.599 --> 07:50.687
He's on the train?

08:23.503 --> 08:24.504
Hey, hey.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.941
Who shot you?

08:26.941 --> 08:28.420
Oh, my God,
he's on the train?

08:28.420 --> 08:30.379
Okay.
Okay.

08:30.379 --> 08:31.772
Hey, hey, hey.
What's going on?

08:31.772 --> 08:32.903
Who shot you?

08:32.903 --> 08:34.078
- This kid--he got shot.
- Hey, no.

08:34.078 --> 08:35.253
Hey, no.

08:35.253 --> 08:36.777
Take a breath.

08:36.777 --> 08:38.387
Keep them calm so I can help
this man, you got me?

08:38.387 --> 08:39.388
- Okay.
- Can you do that?

08:39.388 --> 08:40.520
- Okay.
- You can.

08:40.520 --> 08:43.566
You can do it.
You can do it. Go.

08:43.566 --> 08:44.698
Yeah, he's here.
I know.

08:44.698 --> 08:45.960
I know that he's here.

08:45.960 --> 08:47.178
Can you tell me
what he looked like?

08:47.178 --> 08:48.310
What was he wearing?

08:48.310 --> 08:49.529
Can you describe him at all?

08:49.529 --> 08:51.095
They lied.

08:51.095 --> 08:53.010
They said he went
to California.

08:53.010 --> 08:54.708
California?
They're in California.

08:54.708 --> 08:56.361
Who's in California?
- They were lying.

08:56.361 --> 08:58.189
He isn't gone.

08:58.189 --> 08:59.234
They're not gone?

08:59.234 --> 09:00.322
Who's not gone?

09:06.807 --> 09:08.678
- He's got a gun!
- Drop the weapon!

09:10.593 --> 09:12.639
Move, move, move!

09:12.639 --> 09:13.988
Come on, man.
Move!

09:13.988 --> 09:15.816
- Don't shoot!
- Out of the way!

09:17.948 --> 09:18.993
Hey.

09:18.993 --> 09:21.169
I'm gonna put this
on you, okay?

09:24.128 --> 09:28.219
Damn it.

09:28.219 --> 09:29.612
What's happening?

09:29.612 --> 09:32.397
I need something
to stop the blood.

09:32.397 --> 09:34.704
Scarf.
Give me your scarf!

09:34.704 --> 09:37.794
Yeah.

09:42.843 --> 09:44.192
What the hell was that?

09:44.192 --> 09:47.717
What's going on?
Why are we stopped?

09:47.717 --> 09:48.762
Oh, my God,
we gotta get out of here.

09:48.762 --> 09:49.980
Let's go.

09:49.980 --> 09:51.373
I don't know!
I don't know!

09:54.463 --> 09:56.639
Okay?

09:56.639 --> 09:58.423
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

10:03.603 --> 10:04.821
What just happened?

10:11.741 --> 10:13.830
All right, we're okay.
Everyone stay calm.

10:13.830 --> 10:15.440
All right, everyone stay calm.

10:15.440 --> 10:16.746
All right.
Move past me.

10:16.746 --> 10:18.095
Move behind me.
Come on.

10:18.095 --> 10:19.488
Move, move, move.
Back of the train.

10:19.488 --> 10:21.359
Come on.
Come on, everybody.

10:21.359 --> 10:22.534
I'm CPD.

10:22.534 --> 10:24.058
Move to the back
of the train, if you can.

10:33.197 --> 10:36.287
Sir, I'm police.
Are you all right?

10:36.287 --> 10:37.941
He was gonna hurt somebody.

10:37.941 --> 10:38.986
I stopped the train.

10:38.986 --> 10:40.117
He went right out there.

10:43.686 --> 10:44.687
Go.
Go help them.

10:44.687 --> 10:45.775
Then get on the horn.

10:45.775 --> 10:47.124
Tell them to stop all trains.

10:47.124 --> 10:48.430
We're evacuating,
and the offender's fleeing.

10:48.430 --> 10:49.910
You understand?
- Got you.

10:49.910 --> 10:52.173
- All right.
- Use the platform.

11:20.854 --> 11:22.246
Yeah.

11:22.246 --> 11:24.161
Follow the platform
all the way to the station.

11:38.132 --> 11:39.611
Hey, it's okay.
I'm not leaving.

11:39.611 --> 11:40.830
I won't leave you.

11:40.830 --> 11:43.877
Find... him.

11:43.877 --> 11:47.228
- What?
- Find him.

11:47.228 --> 11:49.186
I will find him.

11:49.186 --> 11:50.535
Hey.
Breathe.

11:50.535 --> 11:52.668
Can you breathe?
Can you breathe?

11:52.668 --> 11:54.191
Yeah, that's good.

11:56.846 --> 11:58.195
You tell me later, okay?

11:58.195 --> 12:00.763
We'll--tell me when
we're both out of this.

12:03.287 --> 12:05.725
Oh, God.

12:14.255 --> 12:16.257
Get back.
Get back.

13:04.044 --> 13:07.438
This is Officer Adam Ruzek,
badge 59054, in foot pursuit,

13:07.438 --> 13:09.658
underground El between
Wabash and Wells.

13:09.658 --> 13:11.399
No!

13:11.399 --> 13:14.532
No, no, no, no, no.

13:16.230 --> 13:20.060
No. No.

13:20.060 --> 13:21.322
Offender just fired upon me.

13:21.322 --> 13:23.628
Last seen headed
eastbound down the tunnel.

13:23.628 --> 13:29.069
Male, Black, 6 foot,
jeans, black jacket.

13:29.069 --> 13:31.680
<i>No!</i>

13:31.680 --> 13:32.986
Kim?

13:49.741 --> 13:51.613
Jesus, Kim.
Talk to me, now.

13:51.613 --> 13:52.919
Are you hurt?
- Help him.

13:52.919 --> 13:54.050
No.
Listen to me.

13:54.050 --> 13:55.312
Help him.

13:55.312 --> 13:56.444
Kim, listen to me.

13:56.444 --> 13:57.706
He's dead.
- Help him.

13:57.706 --> 13:58.968
He's dead.

13:58.968 --> 14:00.404
Look, just--I need to check.
I need to check.

14:00.404 --> 14:01.841
Listen.
Hey, hey.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.799
Listen.
Look, he's dead, Kim.

14:03.799 --> 14:05.279
Stop, stop, stop.
Just calm down.

14:05.279 --> 14:07.585
Calm down.
Are you injured?

14:08.586 --> 14:09.631
Look at me.
Hey, hey.

14:09.631 --> 14:10.806
Look at me.
Look at me.

14:10.806 --> 14:11.763
Hey.

14:11.763 --> 14:12.677
Come here.

14:12.677 --> 14:14.157
You're okay.

14:14.157 --> 14:16.507
You're not shot.
You're not shot.

14:16.507 --> 14:18.553
You're here with me.
It's okay.

14:18.553 --> 14:19.771
Shh.

14:19.771 --> 14:21.164
Just breathe, breathe, breathe.
- Yeah.

14:21.164 --> 14:22.383
Good.
Breathe.

14:22.383 --> 14:24.124
Breathe, breathe.

14:24.124 --> 14:25.342
Okay.

14:25.342 --> 14:26.953
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

14:54.415 --> 14:56.547
Hey.

14:56.547 --> 14:58.332
Kim?

14:58.332 --> 15:00.160
The team's here.

15:00.160 --> 15:01.161
They're at the platform.

15:01.161 --> 15:02.597
Rails are off now.

15:07.994 --> 15:10.213
Any sign of the offender?

15:10.213 --> 15:11.388
No.

15:11.388 --> 15:12.912
CTA is pulling their cameras.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.739
He must have escaped
at the next platform,

15:14.739 --> 15:17.046
so they should have
a good image.

15:17.046 --> 15:18.178
But listen.

15:18.178 --> 15:20.528
I think you need
to take some time.

15:20.528 --> 15:21.746
You want to sit in the squad,

15:21.746 --> 15:23.052
if you need to call
the therapist--

15:23.052 --> 15:25.315
I need to find the man
that killed that kid.

15:33.367 --> 15:34.498
Are you all right?

15:34.498 --> 15:36.152
I'm fine.

15:42.289 --> 15:43.943
Okay.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.335
All right.
So what do we know?

15:45.335 --> 15:46.467
Uh, single shooter.

15:46.467 --> 15:47.990
Male, Black, 40s.

15:47.990 --> 15:50.210
Uh, fired
one shot on the street.

15:50.210 --> 15:51.646
The victim ran.

15:51.646 --> 15:53.126
Offender followed him
onto the train.

15:53.126 --> 15:56.042
Think he wanted to finish
the job, until he ran into me.

15:56.042 --> 15:58.522
Guess when he realized
I was police, he fled.

15:58.522 --> 16:00.394
- Huh.
- No ID on the victim?

16:00.394 --> 16:02.091
No.
No wallet.

16:02.091 --> 16:04.006
He was beaten
before he was shot.

16:04.006 --> 16:07.531
He had a blunt-force trauma
to the head.

16:07.531 --> 16:10.230
Kept saying, uh, "They lied.

16:10.230 --> 16:11.753
"He wasn't in California.

16:11.753 --> 16:13.102
Find him."

16:17.106 --> 16:20.370
I don't know what it means.

16:20.370 --> 16:21.676
None of it felt planned.

16:21.676 --> 16:23.591
- Yeah.
- The offender was panicked.

16:23.591 --> 16:25.506
He was running on adrenaline.

16:25.506 --> 16:27.116
It--it all felt erratic.

16:28.988 --> 16:33.035
Sergeants, we got
clean photos off the CTA cam--

16:33.035 --> 16:34.471
the offender and the victim.

16:34.471 --> 16:36.256
No facial rec on either.

16:36.256 --> 16:38.171
Intelligence
is running with this.

16:38.171 --> 16:39.955
Will do.

16:39.955 --> 16:40.956
All right.
You heard him.

16:40.956 --> 16:42.697
Let's move, get to 21.

16:42.697 --> 16:44.133
Remember, we're a man down.

16:44.133 --> 16:46.875
Torres is detailed
to mandatory training all week.

16:46.875 --> 16:48.877
If we need bodies,
we'll pull them.

16:50.487 --> 16:51.662
Let's go.

16:51.662 --> 16:52.750
I'm gonna go with the body

16:52.750 --> 16:54.187
back to the morgue.

17:26.697 --> 17:28.699
I'm ready for you.

17:28.699 --> 17:31.137
Good.

17:36.403 --> 17:39.623
He's got bruising
around his ribs, collarbone,

17:39.623 --> 17:42.017
back of the head,
and his jawline.

17:42.017 --> 17:44.498
Scans show evidence
of a traumatic brain injury.

17:44.498 --> 17:47.370
Someone or something hit him
very hard in the head,

17:47.370 --> 17:49.372
hours before his death.

17:49.372 --> 17:50.808
He fought back.

17:50.808 --> 17:52.158
He's got plenty
of defensive wounds,

17:52.158 --> 17:55.465
but the bullet killed him.

17:55.465 --> 17:57.206
He didn't stand a chance.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.516
Anything to give you an ID?

18:02.516 --> 18:03.908
No.

18:03.908 --> 18:06.346
No heavy dental work,
no tattoos, no surgeries.

18:06.346 --> 18:07.564
Nothing easy, right?

18:07.564 --> 18:09.088
So nothing quick.

18:13.657 --> 18:14.919
Do you mind if I--

18:14.919 --> 18:17.270
- Go ahead.
- Yeah.

18:58.441 --> 19:01.792
You have a pen?

19:01.792 --> 19:03.490
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

19:05.405 --> 19:08.712
2189.

19:08.712 --> 19:10.236
Yeah.
Thanks, thanks, thanks.

19:13.630 --> 19:14.588
Uh-huh.

19:14.588 --> 19:16.851
Yeah.

19:16.851 --> 19:18.113
That's right.
That's what I'm saying.

19:18.113 --> 19:19.158
That's--that's what I meant.

19:19.158 --> 19:22.204
All incoming flights. Exactly.

19:22.204 --> 19:24.250
Our John Doe was on a plane,
and he checked a bag.

19:24.250 --> 19:25.468
Okay.

19:25.468 --> 19:28.645
Last four digits of the bag tag
are 2189.

19:28.645 --> 19:30.560
Yeah.
Yeah, that's right.

19:30.560 --> 19:31.866
Rush it.
Call me back.

19:31.866 --> 19:33.824
Okay, so he ran
through that tunnel,

19:33.824 --> 19:35.043
and then to the next platform,

19:35.043 --> 19:36.610
and escaped
to the street above.

19:40.570 --> 19:43.747
We tracked him
on PODs to Wicker Park

19:43.747 --> 19:45.488
and then lost him on foot.

19:46.750 --> 19:48.665
No offender yet.

19:49.405 --> 19:50.972
It is possible
he could have hopped on a bus

19:50.972 --> 19:52.800
or train nearby.
We've got to track it all.

19:54.671 --> 19:56.369
Burgess.

19:56.369 --> 19:58.197
Yeah, 2189.
That's what I said.

20:00.024 --> 20:02.331
Yeah, give it to me.
I'm at one right now.

20:02.331 --> 20:03.985
B-A-G-L-E-Y?

20:03.985 --> 20:05.291
Thanks.

20:06.988 --> 20:08.903
Jamie Bagley.

20:08.903 --> 20:10.992
18 years old,
Minnesota native.

20:10.992 --> 20:12.036
That's the kid from the train.

20:12.036 --> 20:13.603
But what was he doing here?

20:16.998 --> 20:19.000
- Right there.
- Aaron Bagley.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.654
That's our offender.

20:20.654 --> 20:22.699
Jesus, that's Jamie's uncle.

20:41.892 --> 20:43.154
Move up.

21:02.348 --> 21:03.436
Kevin.

21:42.301 --> 21:43.606
Chicago PD.
Get up.

21:43.606 --> 21:45.347
- What's happening?
- You're all right.

21:45.347 --> 21:47.306
I'm gonna check you
for a weapon now, all right?

21:47.306 --> 21:48.829
Where's your husband,
Aaron Bagley?

21:48.829 --> 21:50.961
He's not here.

21:50.961 --> 21:52.833
Where is he?

21:52.833 --> 21:54.138
I don't know.

21:54.138 --> 21:56.358
Don't lie.
It won't help.

21:56.358 --> 21:57.620
Oh, my baby's down--

21:57.620 --> 21:59.405
Your baby is okay.
Your baby is sleeping.

21:59.405 --> 22:01.320
Where's Aaron?
Answer the question.

22:03.887 --> 22:06.063
Where is he?

22:06.063 --> 22:07.978
I have no idea.

22:16.465 --> 22:17.945
Please, my son
doesn't like strangers.

22:17.945 --> 22:19.033
I need to be holding him.

22:19.033 --> 22:20.687
Tell me where
your husband is.

22:20.687 --> 22:22.993
He shot your nephew
in broad daylight.

22:22.993 --> 22:24.473
Now, where is he?

22:24.473 --> 22:25.735
He left
before I went to sleep.

22:25.735 --> 22:27.084
Left for where?

22:27.084 --> 22:28.085
I don't know.

22:28.085 --> 22:30.087
He didn't tell me.

22:30.087 --> 22:32.220
Sarge, Aaron's truck is gone.

22:32.220 --> 22:34.918
Please, let me
just hold my son.

22:34.918 --> 22:36.137
Your nephew, Jamie.

22:36.137 --> 22:39.053
He ever stay here?

22:39.053 --> 22:41.969
No.

22:41.969 --> 22:44.798
That boy never came here.

22:50.804 --> 22:54.155
Suitcase belonged to Jamie.

22:54.155 --> 22:56.984
And she didn't even bother
to hide it?

22:56.984 --> 22:59.682
And Jamie's jacket
under the bed.

22:59.682 --> 23:03.860
Wallet, phone, keys.

23:03.860 --> 23:05.732
I mean, no doubt he was here.

23:15.829 --> 23:17.700
Why is this room so empty?

23:17.700 --> 23:19.093
I don't know.

23:19.093 --> 23:20.399
There's hardly any clothes
in here, either.

23:25.316 --> 23:28.537
Where is Aaron?

23:28.537 --> 23:31.192
Look, I am going to keep
asking you the same question.

23:31.192 --> 23:33.716
Where's your other son?

23:33.716 --> 23:34.804
Lucas isn't here.

23:34.804 --> 23:36.806
He slept away.
I already said that.

23:36.806 --> 23:38.199
Away where?

23:38.199 --> 23:39.330
He's on vacation.

23:39.330 --> 23:40.593
He's with family.

23:40.593 --> 23:43.813
Vacation where?

23:43.813 --> 23:45.467
In California.

23:51.778 --> 23:54.433
This is what Jamie was
talking about on the train.

23:54.433 --> 23:57.087
He said "they" lied, and that
"he" wasn't in California.

23:57.087 --> 23:59.786
Jamie was talking about Lucas.

23:59.786 --> 24:01.265
They did something
to their son.

24:01.265 --> 24:02.832
Yeah.

24:02.832 --> 24:04.747
That bed hasn't been slept in
in weeks--the whole room.

24:04.747 --> 24:07.271
Jamie must have found out
when he visited.

24:07.271 --> 24:09.491
This is what it's about, Sarge.

24:09.491 --> 24:10.710
They did something
to their son.

24:10.710 --> 24:12.320
Jamie found out.

24:12.320 --> 24:13.930
So Aaron beat him and chased
him out on the street,

24:13.930 --> 24:15.889
and shot him, and tried
to finish the job on the train.

24:15.889 --> 24:17.499
This is it.

24:17.499 --> 24:19.849
All right.
Let's move.

24:19.849 --> 24:21.285
Let's get out an AMBER alert,

24:21.285 --> 24:22.591
get calls out to every
family member

24:22.591 --> 24:24.332
that woman has in California.

24:24.332 --> 24:26.116
And I want
this entire property searched.

24:26.116 --> 24:28.162
Get the dogs in.
Let's go.

24:40.522 --> 24:42.045
Anything?

24:42.045 --> 24:44.091
No, ma'am.

24:44.091 --> 24:46.310
Nothing so far.

24:46.310 --> 24:47.616
I mean, the yard looks clear.

24:47.616 --> 24:49.313
No signs of anything
freshly dug.

24:49.313 --> 24:52.621
There's nothing
in the house we can move on.

24:52.621 --> 24:56.277
Marlene's not
giving us anything.

24:56.277 --> 24:57.887
Any family in California?

24:57.887 --> 24:59.628
No.
Platt hasn't found

24:59.628 --> 25:01.195
a single family member there yet.

25:09.246 --> 25:11.118
What did you clear so far?

25:11.118 --> 25:12.685
Started in this corner.

25:12.685 --> 25:14.861
- I got this side.
- I got this side.

26:02.430 --> 26:04.563
Burge, you good?

26:04.563 --> 26:06.086
Yeah.

26:34.984 --> 26:36.943
Ruz.

26:45.038 --> 26:46.909
Oh, my God.

26:48.650 --> 26:51.392
They kept him here.

26:54.134 --> 26:57.180
That's not enough blood
for a death.

26:57.180 --> 27:00.270
And it's still wet.
Aaron must have just moved him.

27:14.110 --> 27:15.938
That woman's never gonna say
a damn thing.

27:15.938 --> 27:17.940
No, she knows
that kind of child abuse,

27:17.940 --> 27:20.073
she's going away
for the rest of her life.

27:20.073 --> 27:21.814
Right, any hints on Aaron?
- Not yet.

27:21.814 --> 27:23.598
No pops on his truck
or his credit card,

27:23.598 --> 27:24.860
but we got alerts
out everywhere.

27:24.860 --> 27:26.340
On Lucas, on Aaron--

27:26.340 --> 27:27.689
whole city's on alert.

27:27.689 --> 27:29.299
All right.
She lawyered up.

27:29.299 --> 27:30.474
So what else we got?

27:30.474 --> 27:32.128
The Bagleys have
no priors with DCFS,

27:32.128 --> 27:33.956
but the neighbors said
they haven't seen Lucas

27:33.956 --> 27:35.610
since the new baby was born.

27:35.610 --> 27:37.438
It was around that time when
Lucas was taken out of school.

27:37.438 --> 27:39.483
Marlene told the school that
he was going to California

27:39.483 --> 27:40.833
to live with family.

27:40.833 --> 27:42.486
We have zero evidence
that there's any family

27:42.486 --> 27:43.792
in California, Sarge.

27:43.792 --> 27:45.968
All right.
But how does Jamie fit in?

27:45.968 --> 27:47.840
- He loved his cousin.
- Huh?

27:47.840 --> 27:49.537
Jamie's phone records indicate

27:49.537 --> 27:51.017
he was texting
Marlene and Aaron

27:51.017 --> 27:53.454
repeatedly for two months,
trying to talk to Lucas.

27:53.454 --> 27:55.804
Jamie must have suspected
something was wrong,

27:55.804 --> 27:58.851
flew out without telling them,
and discovered they were lying.

27:58.851 --> 28:00.722
We confirm
with Jamie's parents?

28:00.722 --> 28:01.941
Still haven't found them.

28:01.941 --> 28:03.638
Local police are
hunting them down.

28:03.638 --> 28:05.031
Okay.
I think we got something.

28:05.031 --> 28:06.728
Traffic cam
just picked up Aaron's truck

28:06.728 --> 28:08.687
exiting 294 at Beck Lake.

28:08.687 --> 28:11.341
5021 en route.
Keep eyes.

28:11.341 --> 28:13.648
<i>Park staff
has Aaron's truck on video</i>

28:13.648 --> 28:14.997
<i>entering ten minutes ago.</i>

28:14.997 --> 28:17.173
<i>No sign of Lucas
on the footage.</i>

28:17.173 --> 28:19.132
Copy. Do we know
where Aaron's truck is parked?

28:19.132 --> 28:20.394
<i>No.
Surveillance has him</i>

28:20.394 --> 28:21.700
<i>entering the park.</i>

28:21.700 --> 28:23.440
<i>We gotta split up
and do a grid search.</i>

28:23.440 --> 28:24.833
Copy.
We'll take the service road

28:24.833 --> 28:26.269
on the south side of the park.

28:38.020 --> 28:39.935
I'll go east.
You go west.

29:33.510 --> 29:34.947
I've got Aaron's truck.

29:34.947 --> 29:37.514
East side of the river,
20 meters out.

29:37.514 --> 29:39.386
<i>Yeah, copy you.
Coming that way.</i>

30:18.817 --> 30:21.297
Truck's empty.
Engine's still warm.

30:21.297 --> 30:23.212
They gotta be around
here somewhere.

30:23.212 --> 30:24.561
Lucas!

30:24.561 --> 30:25.824
<i>Copy you.</i>

30:39.925 --> 30:41.404
Lucas, come back.

30:43.972 --> 30:48.803
Lucas!

31:02.991 --> 31:07.169
Lucas.

31:15.830 --> 31:17.701
Lucas?

31:17.701 --> 31:20.008
Lucas, I'm police.

31:20.008 --> 31:21.880
Lucas, I'll help you.

31:23.969 --> 31:26.319
I can hear Lucas.

31:26.319 --> 31:27.929
East side of the park.
I can hear Lucas.

31:27.929 --> 31:29.452
I can hear Aaron,
but I don't have eyes.

31:29.452 --> 31:30.714
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

31:35.502 --> 31:37.330
Oh, my God.

31:37.330 --> 31:39.723
No, no, no.

31:39.723 --> 31:41.160
Lucas!

31:43.075 --> 31:43.989
Oh, my God.

31:43.989 --> 31:45.642
Help.

31:48.558 --> 31:52.214
Lucas is in a well.
I'm going in.

32:06.359 --> 32:08.274
Lucas, hi.

32:10.711 --> 32:12.060
I'm police.

32:12.060 --> 32:13.932
I'm gonna help you, okay?

32:13.932 --> 32:15.629
Are you hurt?

32:15.629 --> 32:17.500
Yeah.

32:17.500 --> 32:19.589
Okay.
Um, can you move your legs?

32:19.589 --> 32:20.939
- Yes.
- Yes.

32:20.939 --> 32:24.246
Okay.

32:24.246 --> 32:26.422
I'm going to help you climb up,
'cause we have to get

32:26.422 --> 32:28.468
out of this water, all right?

32:28.468 --> 32:31.166
Come on.

33:55.294 --> 33:57.818
Okay.
You're okay.

33:57.818 --> 33:59.428
Breathe.

34:19.318 --> 34:21.015
Come on.

34:21.885 --> 34:25.237
Come on.

34:26.325 --> 34:28.849
Come on.

34:37.249 --> 34:40.121
Guys, I'm--I'm in the well.

34:40.121 --> 34:44.821
We're trapped,
and Lucas is hurt.

34:46.345 --> 34:47.998
It's cold.

34:52.307 --> 34:53.395
Oh, God.

34:59.314 --> 35:01.186
Breathe.

35:06.930 --> 35:09.542
Breathe.

35:09.542 --> 35:11.979
Please...

35:17.115 --> 35:20.944
Get him out.

35:38.397 --> 35:43.010
Come with me.

35:43.010 --> 35:45.360
Don't be scared.

35:45.360 --> 35:50.365
Okay.

35:50.365 --> 35:52.759
Don't--don't be scared.

35:56.241 --> 35:58.417
- Ow, my arm.
- Okay, okay.

36:11.256 --> 36:12.822
Move.

36:25.444 --> 36:26.749
Look at me.

36:26.749 --> 36:29.839
You're okay, all right?

36:29.839 --> 36:32.581
Can you hold onto this?

36:32.581 --> 36:35.018
Stay against the wall.

36:55.213 --> 36:58.564
Move.

37:51.138 --> 37:52.618
Lucas.

37:52.618 --> 37:54.141
Hang on, Lucas.

37:54.141 --> 37:55.360
Okay.

37:59.189 --> 38:00.016
Help.

38:00.016 --> 38:01.496
Lucas is in the well.

38:01.496 --> 38:04.325
He's--he's injured,
and he needs an extraction.

38:04.325 --> 38:05.674
<i>Copy that.
We hear you.</i>

38:05.674 --> 38:07.154
<i>We're coming.</i>

38:10.200 --> 38:11.550
Kim?

38:11.550 --> 38:12.725
Where's Aaron?
Where's Aaron?

38:12.725 --> 38:13.900
He's dead.

38:13.900 --> 38:15.641
He fired on Upton.
He's dead.

38:15.641 --> 38:17.077
You gotta get in there.

38:17.077 --> 38:18.687
You gotta--
- I got it.

38:18.687 --> 38:19.819
He's going to be hypothermic.

38:19.819 --> 38:20.820
I'm coming, kid.

38:50.458 --> 38:52.199
Kim?

38:52.199 --> 38:55.942
Yeah.
I'm coming.

38:55.942 --> 38:58.423
<i>I can't feel this.</i>

38:58.423 --> 39:00.381
Feel what?

39:00.381 --> 39:05.255
Like I'm getting shot
all over again.

39:05.255 --> 39:08.911
Like I'm bleeding out,
every time I--

39:08.911 --> 39:12.001
I hear a gun go off.

39:12.001 --> 39:13.394
I almost lost that boy.

39:13.394 --> 39:15.483
You didn't lose him.
You saved him.

39:15.483 --> 39:17.485
You told me he was
going to be just fine.

39:17.485 --> 39:21.359
I can't be who I wanna be
with this.

39:21.359 --> 39:25.363
Not for my daughter,
and not for Adam.

39:31.630 --> 39:33.545
And I can't be a cop.

39:36.591 --> 39:40.682
They bench cops for this.

39:40.682 --> 39:46.949
I can't--I can't
not do this job.

39:46.949 --> 39:49.169
I don't ever wanna not do
this job.

39:58.047 --> 40:02.182
You said I'm trapped,
but I can't be trapped.

40:04.924 --> 40:06.447
Okay.

40:06.447 --> 40:08.406
Then we work
on getting you free.
