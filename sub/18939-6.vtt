part TWO

01:15.013 --> 01:17.013
Violet, Klaus and Sunny,

01:17.817 --> 01:21.733
By the time you read this note,
my life will be at it's end.

01:22.733 --> 01:26.025
My heart is as cold as Ike,
and I find my life inbearable.

01:27.025 --> 01:30.525
I know your children may not understand
the sad life of a dowadger,

01:30.608 --> 01:31.983
or what would have lead...

01:32.442 --> 01:34.317
leadled me to this desperate akt...

01:35.400 --> 01:38.025
but please know
that I am much happier this way.

01:38.108 --> 01:39.775
As my last will and testament,

01:39.858 --> 01:42.067
I leave you three in the care
of Captain Sham,

01:42.650 --> 01:44.150
a kind and honorable men.

01:45.192 --> 01:48.358
Please think of me kindly,
even though I'd done this terrible thing.

01:48.983 --> 01:50.567
Josephine Anwhistle."

01:50.650 --> 01:53.025
- It can't be.
- Can't be.

01:54.317 --> 01:56.650
When you lose someone important to you,

01:56.733 --> 02:00.608
"it can't be" are often the words
that run through your saddened head.

02:00.692 --> 02:03.025
It can't be that I've lost
someone so important.

02:03.108 --> 02:05.317
It can't be that I will never
see them again.

02:05.400 --> 02:07.233
It can't be, it can't be...

02:08.483 --> 02:09.317
it can't be.

02:11.442 --> 02:12.775
My name is Lemony Snicket,

02:12.858 --> 02:15.442
and it is my job to report the history
of the Baudelaire orphans,

02:15.525 --> 02:17.692
but it can't be that you have
nothing better to do.

02:18.608 --> 02:20.358
The Baudelaires believed, incorrectly,

02:20.442 --> 02:22.483
that they would never see
their Aunt Josephine again,

02:22.567 --> 02:25.900
but it can't be that you are interested
in watching them suffer

02:25.983 --> 02:31.275
as her last words echo again and again
throughout her empty and doomed house.

02:33.108 --> 02:34.150
It can't be.

02:34.233 --> 02:35.567
<i>"As my last will and testament,</i>

02:35.650 --> 02:38.192
I leave you three in the care
of Captain Sham,

02:38.275 --> 02:39.858
a kind and honorable men.

02:39.942 --> 02:43.483
Please think of me kindly
even though I'd done this terrible thing."

02:43.567 --> 02:46.900
Yes, yes.
I understand. I'll tell them.

02:46.983 --> 02:50.108
Of course, I'll tell them.
I promise I'll tell them.

02:50.733 --> 02:51.692
Goodbye.

02:53.150 --> 02:56.567
Mr. Poe says we can always rely
on Mulctuary Money Management.

02:56.650 --> 02:57.733
I just can't believe it.

02:57.817 --> 02:59.525
It's all there in ink
and shaky handwriting.

02:59.608 --> 03:02.442
Aunt Josephine is dead and she's left us
in the care of Count Olaf.

03:02.525 --> 03:04.567
It's not right.
There's something funny about this note.

03:04.650 --> 03:07.192
There's nothing funny about
a woman throwing herself out a window.

03:07.275 --> 03:10.442
Not funny as in a funny joke.
Funny as in a funny... smell.

03:11.608 --> 03:12.983
Let me show you.

03:16.358 --> 03:19.150
In the very first sentence, she says,
"My life will be at it's end."

03:19.233 --> 03:21.650
- And now it is.
- That's not what I mean.

03:21.733 --> 03:26.192
She says "it's," I-T-apostrophe-S,
meaning "it is."

03:26.775 --> 03:28.942
She means I-T-S.
That's a sizable grammatical error.

03:29.025 --> 03:31.858
Who cares about grammatical errors
when she jumped out a window?

03:31.942 --> 03:33.775
Aunt Josephine would've cared.

03:33.858 --> 03:35.525
She said grammar
was the greatest joy in life.

03:35.608 --> 03:36.608
That's not enough.

03:36.692 --> 03:39.900
No matter how much she liked grammar,
she says she found her life unbearable.

03:39.983 --> 03:43.608
That's another error. She didn't say she
found her life unbearable, with a U.

03:43.692 --> 03:46.775
She said she found her life inbearable,
with an I.

03:46.858 --> 03:47.983
That's not a word.

03:48.067 --> 03:50.858
Our situation isn't inbearable.
It's unbearable.

03:50.942 --> 03:52.775
Aunt Josephine left us
in the care of Captain Sham,

03:52.858 --> 03:54.233
and I don't know what we can do about it.

03:54.317 --> 03:56.483
I wish we'd never read Mr. Poe that note.

03:56.567 --> 03:59.400
Then we could've torn it up
and forged a new one in her handwriting

03:59.483 --> 04:01.858
that didn't mention... Captain Sham.

04:01.942 --> 04:04.483
Wouldn't it be difficult
to imitate her handwriting?

04:05.108 --> 04:07.150
Maybe it's not her handwriting at all.

04:07.925 --> 04:09.925
Olaf.

04:30.067 --> 04:31.983
Forgery? That's a very serious charge.

04:32.067 --> 04:34.525
- Not as serious as murder.
- Which is what Count Olaf did.

04:34.608 --> 04:37.358
He murdered Aunt Josephine
and forged a note.

04:37.442 --> 04:39.400
Again with Count Olaf. I must say,

04:39.483 --> 04:41.900
other than a gaping, middle-aged
woman-shaped hole in the window,

04:41.983 --> 04:44.483
I can see no sign of a struggle
or a break-in.

04:44.567 --> 04:48.317
We told you. Count Olaf didn't have
to break into Aunt Josephine's house.

04:48.400 --> 04:50.983
He was in disguise and Aunt Josephine
fell for it, hook, line and sinker.

04:51.067 --> 04:52.567
Please, there's no time for fishing jokes.

04:52.650 --> 04:54.567
There's a very simple way
to tell who wrote this note.

04:54.650 --> 04:58.108
We simply have to compare it
to your Aunt Josephine's handwriting.

04:58.192 --> 05:01.567
That's... actually an excellent idea.

05:01.650 --> 05:03.400
You are very intelligent children,

05:03.483 --> 05:06.317
but even the most intelligent people
sometimes need the help of a banker.

05:08.983 --> 05:10.358
Wait right here.

05:13.067 --> 05:16.108
Here's Aunt Josephine's shopping list.
We can use this to compare.

05:16.192 --> 05:17.317
Oh, look here.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.025
Look at the V
in "Several gallons of Vinegar,"

05:19.108 --> 05:21.692
and how it matches the V in "Violet"
she wrote in the note.

05:21.775 --> 05:23.692
And look at the C
in "Cold Soup Ingredients,"

05:23.775 --> 05:25.483
and how it matches
the C in "Captain Sham."

05:25.567 --> 05:28.317
And look where she writes "I think
shopping is terribly dangerous"

05:28.400 --> 05:32.192
and how it matches "think of me kindly,
even though I'd done this terrible thing."

05:32.275 --> 05:34.567
It should be
"I've done this terrible thing."

05:34.650 --> 05:37.150
Yes, it is a terrible thing,
and I'm sure it's very upsetting to read.

05:37.233 --> 05:39.233
But once and for all,
we can see the note is not a forgery.

05:39.317 --> 05:40.442
You're right.

05:40.525 --> 05:42.192
But why would this Captain Sham person

05:42.275 --> 05:44.317
go through so much trouble
just to place you under his care?

05:44.400 --> 05:47.733
We've already told you,
Captain Sham is Count Olaf in disguise.

05:47.817 --> 05:50.567
Now then, I know you three
have had some terrible experiences,

05:50.650 --> 05:53.442
but you mustn't start letting
your imaginations get the best of you.

05:53.525 --> 05:55.317
Remember when you were staying
with Uncle Monty?

05:55.400 --> 05:57.692
You were convinced
that his assistant, Stephano,

05:57.775 --> 06:00.067
was actually Count Olaf in disguise.

06:00.650 --> 06:03.025
Stephano was actually
Count Olaf in disguise.

06:03.108 --> 06:05.942
The point is that you can't
just start jumping to conclusions.

06:06.025 --> 06:08.483
You've jumped to the conclusion
that this note was a forgery,

06:08.567 --> 06:10.025
and now you're jumping to the conclusion

06:10.108 --> 06:12.025
that a villainous man
who swore he'd stop at nothing

06:12.108 --> 06:13.942
until he got ahold
of your parents' enormous fortune

06:14.025 --> 06:16.900
is involved in some plot to get ahold
of your parents' enormous fortune.

06:16.983 --> 06:19.400
You don't have to believe us.
See for yourself.

06:20.858 --> 06:23.692
His troupe has been camped outside
all night keeping an eye on us.

06:27.067 --> 06:29.442
Ah, I see an approaching hurricane,
but no theatrical troupe.

06:30.354 --> 06:30.826
Awkward.

06:31.150 --> 06:32.358
It's like I said, Baudelaires.

06:32.442 --> 06:34.983
You're letting your imagination
get the best of you.

06:35.067 --> 06:36.567
Imagination's all well and good

06:36.650 --> 06:38.650
for children's books
or digital entertainment,

06:38.733 --> 06:40.025
but this is real life.

06:40.108 --> 06:41.775
Mr. Poe, you have to believe us

06:41.858 --> 06:44.525
when we tell you that Captain Sham
is really Count Olaf.

06:44.608 --> 06:46.400
Aunt Josephine's note
might not have been forged,

06:46.483 --> 06:47.900
but there's something suspicious going on.

06:47.983 --> 06:49.817
It's full of grammatical errors.

06:49.900 --> 06:51.650
Children, disguises
and grammatical errors,

06:51.733 --> 06:54.650
these are dire accusations,
but they're easily investigated.

06:54.733 --> 06:56.692
We can settle the whole matter
over brunch.

06:56.775 --> 06:57.775
Brunch?

06:57.858 --> 07:00.067
Yes, it's a word for the combination
of breakfast and lunch.

07:00.150 --> 07:01.317
We know what brunch means.

07:01.400 --> 07:03.525
Oh, good, then you'll have
an easy time with the menu.

07:03.608 --> 07:05.858
Captain Sham's invited us all
to a restaurant to talk this over.

07:05.942 --> 07:07.942
You've already spoken with Captain Sham?

07:08.025 --> 07:10.858
Yes, by some strange coincidence,
he called me accidentally,

07:10.942 --> 07:14.400
trying to reach a knife store to buy
a surprise for some children he knows.

07:14.483 --> 07:16.775
He was shocked to hear
about Josephine's death,

07:16.858 --> 07:19.025
but overjoyed at the prospect
of raising you children.

07:19.108 --> 07:20.608
What sailor wouldn't be?

07:20.692 --> 07:22.775
We're not going to brunch
with that villain.

07:22.858 --> 07:26.025
- We'll stay here and examine the note.
- Oh, no, no, Baudelaires.

07:26.108 --> 07:28.358
I want to settle this matter
once and for all.

07:28.442 --> 07:31.567
They tell me Hurricane Herman
is going to be so enormous and menacing

07:31.650 --> 07:34.442
it'll most likely shut down
all electric power in the city.

07:34.525 --> 07:35.692
So I want to settle this quickly,

07:35.775 --> 07:37.942
put you in the hands of a sailor
I just met on the phone,

07:38.025 --> 07:41.150
before returning safe and sound
to the city.

07:46.608 --> 07:49.317
Children, I promise to investigate
this man Captain Sham

07:49.400 --> 07:51.775
to the fullest extent
of my ability as a banker.

07:51.858 --> 07:56.983
If he's in disguise as you claim,
the eyes of Poe will catch it immediately.

07:57.060 --> 07:59.060
You missed the turn.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
Anxious Clown Restaurant

08:19.733 --> 08:22.608
You probably know of a plant
called the Venus flytrap

08:22.692 --> 08:23.900
which grows in the tropics

08:23.983 --> 08:26.817
and in the apartments
of certain lonely people.

08:27.483 --> 08:30.067
The top of the plant is shaped
like an open mouth

08:30.150 --> 08:31.983
with toothlike spines around the edges.

08:32.067 --> 08:34.942
When a fly
attracted to the smell of the flower

08:35.025 --> 08:37.357
lands on the Venus flytrap,

08:37.442 --> 08:41.525
the mouth of the plant begins to close,
trapping the terrified fly

08:41.607 --> 08:44.692
who slowly, slowly, slowly...

08:44.775 --> 08:46.233
dissolves into nothing.

08:47.983 --> 08:50.942
As Violet, Klaus and Sunny arrived
at their brunch with Count Olaf,

08:51.025 --> 08:54.025
a few minutes late
because Mr. Poe missed the turn...

09:00.108 --> 09:01.817
they felt as helpless as a fly

09:01.900 --> 09:05.817
as Count Olaf's evil scheme
closed around them.

09:06.192 --> 09:08.275
Sadly, they would not learn
for a long time

09:08.358 --> 09:11.525
that someone was there,
desperately trying to help them.

09:11.608 --> 09:14.442
Uh, hello, I'm Larry, your waiter.
Welcome to the Anxious Clown Restaurant,

09:14.525 --> 09:16.400
where everybody has a good time
whether they like it or not.

09:16.483 --> 09:18.233
I can see we have a whole family
lunching together,

09:18.317 --> 09:21.025
so allow me to recommend
the Extra Fun Special Family Appetizer.

09:21.108 --> 09:23.400
It's a bunch of things fried up together
and served with a sauce.

09:23.900 --> 09:25.775
Well, that sounds wonderful!

09:25.858 --> 09:30.942
Extra Special Family Fun Appetizer
for an extra special family.

09:31.525 --> 09:32.608
Mine.

09:32.692 --> 09:34.692
I'll just have a glass of water,
thank you.

09:34.775 --> 09:38.275
Same for me. And a glass of ice cubes
for my baby sister, please.

09:38.358 --> 09:40.608
I'll have a cup of coffee
with nondairy creamer, please.

09:40.692 --> 09:44.400
Oh, no, Poe. Let's, uh, share
a nice bottle of red wine.

09:44.483 --> 09:47.692
Oh, no, thanks, Captain Sham.
I don't drink during banking hours.

09:47.775 --> 09:50.358
Yeah, but it's a celebratory brunch.
We should drink a toast.

09:50.442 --> 09:53.692
After all, it's not every day that
a man becomes a father of three children.

09:54.275 --> 09:56.650
Please, Sham.
It's heartening to know that

09:56.733 --> 09:58.858
you're glad to raise the children,
but you must understand,

09:58.942 --> 10:01.358
the children lost their Aunt Josephine.
They're rather upset.

10:01.442 --> 10:03.358
I'm upset, too. I'm...

10:03.442 --> 10:05.442
I'm probably more upset.

10:05.942 --> 10:08.233
Josephine was my, uh...

10:08.317 --> 10:09.858
uh...

10:09.942 --> 10:13.733
Josephine was my oldest
and dearest friend. Thank you.

10:16.067 --> 10:18.233
You met her yesterday
at the town market and petting zoo.

10:19.608 --> 10:23.400
It really does seem like yesterday,
but actually it was many years ago.

10:24.275 --> 10:26.192
She and I met at cooking school.

10:26.275 --> 10:29.150
We were oven partners
in the Advanced Baking Course.

10:29.233 --> 10:30.817
You weren't oven partners.

10:30.900 --> 10:33.817
Aunt Josephine was desperately afraid
of turning on an oven.

10:33.900 --> 10:36.983
Soon we became fast friends,
and then one day she said to me,

10:37.067 --> 10:41.442
"If I ever adopt some orphans
and then meet an untimely death,

10:41.525 --> 10:44.733
promise me that you will raise them
as if they were your own."

10:45.025 --> 10:48.608
Of course, I agreed, but I had no idea
I would have to keep that promise.

10:49.692 --> 10:50.983
Josephine is dead?

10:53.692 --> 10:54.525
Yes.

10:55.233 --> 10:58.067
Josephine jumped
out of the window

10:58.150 --> 11:00.317
of her own home late last night.

11:00.983 --> 11:02.025
Didn't you hear?

11:03.858 --> 11:06.400
I didn't realize this was a sad occasion.
In that case,

11:06.483 --> 11:09.025
allow me to recommend
the Cheer-Up Cheeseburgers.

11:09.108 --> 11:12.900
The pickles, mustard and ketchup make
a little smiley face on top of the burger,

11:12.983 --> 11:15.567
which is guaranteed
to get ya smilin', too.

11:15.650 --> 11:19.483
So make sure you look inside
before you eat it.

11:21.775 --> 11:23.817
Well, that's a wonderful idea.

11:23.900 --> 11:26.692
Cheer-Up Cheeseburgers
for everyone, Larry!

11:32.483 --> 11:34.608
Odd service, here.

11:34.692 --> 11:36.608
- It's the off-season.
- Ah.

11:38.650 --> 11:39.900
Nice performance out there.

11:39.983 --> 11:41.858
Stick to the script and we won't
throw you to the leeches.

11:41.942 --> 11:43.567
Yeah, no funny business, clown.

11:43.650 --> 11:45.775
It's Larry.
I told you my name is Larry.

11:45.858 --> 11:48.483
- We don't care what your name is.
- Or what gender you are.

11:48.567 --> 11:49.817
Or whether that hair is real.

11:49.900 --> 11:51.442
- It's a clown wig.
- We don't care!

11:51.525 --> 11:53.525
Make sure you don't blow this.

11:53.608 --> 11:55.400
- So if you want to make it out of here...
- Alive.

11:55.483 --> 11:58.400
- With both hands.
- you better do exactly what we say.

11:58.483 --> 12:00.192
You're gonna fix a nice lunch
for everybody.

12:00.275 --> 12:02.567
- With no tricks.
- No knockout drugs.

12:02.650 --> 12:04.317
- No poison.
- And no secret messages written in...

12:04.400 --> 12:05.650
- Ketchup.
- Mustard.

12:05.733 --> 12:08.192
Or wasabi mayo
in the Cheer-Up Cheeseburgers!

12:09.775 --> 12:11.317
You'll never defeat us.

12:11.400 --> 12:13.858
You can surround us.
You can throw us out of windows.

12:13.942 --> 12:15.733
You can threaten us
and make us cook for you...

12:15.817 --> 12:18.025
Sorry to interrupt,
but what's the soup of the day?

12:19.525 --> 12:22.400
I want to emphasize straightaway
that the Baudelaire fortune

12:22.483 --> 12:25.608
will still be under my supervision
until Violet comes of age.

12:25.692 --> 12:28.067
What fortune?
I don't know about any fortune.

12:28.311 --> 12:29.126
Sham!

12:29.150 --> 12:31.400
MR. - The Baudelaire parents, uh,

12:31.483 --> 12:32.942
have left behind an enormous fortune

12:33.025 --> 12:35.067
that the children will inherit
when Violet comes of age.

12:35.150 --> 12:37.442
Oh, I have no interest in a fortune.

12:37.525 --> 12:38.900
I've got my sailboats.

12:39.134 --> 12:40.001
Ugh!

12:40.025 --> 12:43.733
Mr. Poe,Sunny's right.
Surely you can finally see that this man...

12:43.817 --> 12:45.150
Beverages!

12:45.233 --> 12:46.942
- Coffee for the gentleman.
- Thank you.

12:47.025 --> 12:49.067
A Fuzzy Navel for the sailor.

12:49.150 --> 12:51.400
- What?
- A gift from someone in the kitchen.

12:51.900 --> 12:55.858
- And water and ice for the Baudelaires.
- You know our names?

12:56.608 --> 12:59.358
Of course I don't know your names.

13:03.192 --> 13:06.192
I've completely forgotten what
we were saying. Don't you hate that?

13:06.275 --> 13:07.567
We were saying that is Count Olaf.

13:07.650 --> 13:11.650
- What, the waiter? He did seem odd.
- No, not the waiter. You!

13:11.733 --> 13:13.900
You've done something terrible
to Aunt Josephine

13:13.983 --> 13:15.733
and you're scheming to get our fortune.

13:15.817 --> 13:17.317
Why would Captain Sham

13:17.400 --> 13:19.150
do something terrible
to his closest friend?

13:19.233 --> 13:20.317
Good point, Poe.

13:20.400 --> 13:23.275
- He isn't Captain Sham.
- He's Count Olaf.

13:33.775 --> 13:36.733
Baudelaires, I've been
more than patient with you.

13:36.817 --> 13:41.733
I understand that losing your parents
and your home has had an emotional effect,

13:41.817 --> 13:43.858
as I imagine it would have on many people.

13:43.942 --> 13:46.733
I've done the best I can
to find a suitable home for you,

13:46.817 --> 13:48.567
but nothing I do seems to be good enough.

13:48.650 --> 13:52.567
And now, faced with a perfectly legal
last will and testament

13:52.650 --> 13:55.108
that will place you in the care
of a sailor you met yesterday,

13:55.192 --> 14:00.983
you start to spout these wild,
McCarthyesque accusations.

14:01.067 --> 14:02.233
What he said.

14:02.317 --> 14:04.775
But if you insist...

14:05.525 --> 14:08.608
I will prove to you
that Captain Sham and Count Olaf

14:08.692 --> 14:11.733
are two completely different people,
step by step,

14:11.817 --> 14:13.233
as if you were babies.

14:14.001 --> 14:14.543
That's offensive.

14:15.067 --> 14:16.900
Here are your Cheer-Up Cheeseburgers!

14:16.983 --> 14:19.775
- Count Olaf has one long eyebrow.
- I meant to ask...

14:19.858 --> 14:23.983
- While Captain Sham has one eyepatch.
- During damp weather, I can hardly wink.

14:24.067 --> 14:25.692
if any of you had any food allergies...

14:25.775 --> 14:28.067
Count Olaf has a tattoo
of an eye on his left ankle.

14:28.150 --> 14:29.483
so I might've informed the chef...

14:29.567 --> 14:32.608
While Captain Sham has half a broomstick
where his left ankle should've been.

14:32.692 --> 14:33.983
We prefer the term "peg leg."

14:34.067 --> 14:37.400
who certainly would not want anyone
to have an allergic reaction...

14:37.483 --> 14:39.317
Count Olaf would have
just met Josephine...

14:39.400 --> 14:41.858
that would force them
to leave the restaurant.

14:41.942 --> 14:43.733
while Captain Sham
has known her for many years.

14:43.817 --> 14:45.608
Along with her husband, what's-his-name.

14:45.692 --> 14:48.525
Count Olaf is a murderous man who's only
interested in your parents' money,

14:48.608 --> 14:51.483
while Captain Sham has expressed
great interest in raising you children

14:51.567 --> 14:53.733
- without touching a single penny.
- We'll see.

14:54.317 --> 14:56.608
- We're allergic to peppermints.
- What?

14:56.692 --> 14:59.192
We'll see. Get me another navel!

15:00.483 --> 15:03.942
So, can we all agree that Captain Sham
has none of the hallmarks,

15:04.025 --> 15:07.025
- earmarks or benchmarks of Count Olaf?
- Agreed.

15:07.108 --> 15:09.025
If we could just go back
to Aunt Josephine's house.

15:09.108 --> 15:10.650
There's something strange about that note.

15:10.733 --> 15:13.858
We've already been over the note,
Baudelaires. It's not a forgery.

15:13.942 --> 15:16.233
And the grammatical mistakes
are merely the nervousness

15:16.317 --> 15:18.567
of any woman who was
about to throw herself out a window.

15:18.650 --> 15:19.858
Hear, hear.

15:20.650 --> 15:23.150
Now, Captain Sham,
I have some papers in my briefcase

15:23.233 --> 15:24.608
that I need you to sign.

15:24.692 --> 15:26.650
And then the children will be mine?

15:26.733 --> 15:28.400
You'll be caring for them, yes.

15:28.483 --> 15:31.108
And there's nothing in the world
that can stop me?

15:31.192 --> 15:34.608
Well, that...
A peculiar way of saying it, but, yes.

15:34.692 --> 15:36.650
I brought the bill. Take your time.

15:36.733 --> 15:39.025
I'm sure none of you are
in any particular hurry.

15:39.108 --> 15:40.400
The banker's buying.

15:40.483 --> 15:42.817
Oh, oh!
Well, okay, that... that's fine.

15:42.900 --> 15:46.567
Uh, Sham, I need to have a few words
with you about the children's education.

15:46.650 --> 15:49.942
Oh, I've always been a big supporter
of the school voucher system.

15:50.025 --> 15:51.900
- Have you indeed? Tell me more.
- Yeah.

15:51.983 --> 15:53.733
Everyone is allergic to something.

15:54.775 --> 15:57.567
Whether it is gluten, injustice,
dark chocolate,

15:57.650 --> 16:01.567
corruption, pollen... or common decency.

16:01.650 --> 16:04.525
And you'll do all the dishes.

16:10.400 --> 16:12.983
The Baudelaire orphans
were allergic to peppermint.

16:13.067 --> 16:16.525
Their allergies were notoriously
quick-acting and powerful.

16:16.608 --> 16:18.400
Of course, if you are allergic to a thing,

16:18.483 --> 16:21.317
it is best not to put that thing
in your mouth,

16:21.400 --> 16:24.025
particularly if the thing is cats.

16:26.692 --> 16:30.108
But Violet, Klaus and Sunny
knew that this was an emergency.

16:30.192 --> 16:33.525
The strange message they had received
seemed to indicate

16:33.608 --> 16:35.567
there was more for the Baudelaires
to investigate,

16:35.650 --> 16:39.400
but not until after they got away
from Count Olaf and his miserable lunch.

16:39.483 --> 16:42.942
So while Mr. Poe began to tell
a very boring story...

16:44.775 --> 16:47.650
That reminds me of a time
I bought a carton of milk.

16:47.733 --> 16:49.608
Well, the clerk asked me
what kind of milk...

16:49.692 --> 16:51.817
the children unwrapped
their peppermints...

16:52.983 --> 16:54.150
and placed them into their mouths.

16:54.233 --> 16:57.858
...almond milk, whole milk.
And so I said, "Low fat, please."

16:57.942 --> 17:00.525
And then the clerk leads me
to the dairy section

17:00.608 --> 17:05.108
where the milk is kept,
and then he said to me, proud as can be...

17:05.192 --> 17:06.525
You look terrible!

17:07.025 --> 17:08.608
We're having allergic reactions.

17:09.442 --> 17:12.567
I feel... I feel quite terrible.

17:13.001 --> 17:14.284
As do I.

17:14.608 --> 17:18.233
Goodness gracious, Violet, you have
huge, ugly, red patches on your skin.

17:18.317 --> 17:20.108
Klaus, your tongue is swelling.

17:20.192 --> 17:21.525
Sunny, both things are happening to you.

17:21.608 --> 17:23.650
- I'm sure it's nothing.
- Nothing?

17:23.733 --> 17:26.817
Violet has a hive on her face
the size of a hard-boiled egg.

17:26.900 --> 17:28.817
They just need to take some deep breaths.

17:28.900 --> 17:31.733
- I think we should go home and rest.
- An excellent idea.

17:31.817 --> 17:34.733
Poe, it's in the middle of brunch.
Just lean back in your seat.

17:34.817 --> 17:37.108
Captain Sham, the children are quite ill.

17:37.192 --> 17:39.442
Let's pay the bill
and take the children home.

17:39.525 --> 17:41.358
No, no. We can go home by ourselves.

17:41.442 --> 17:44.442
I wouldn't dream of leaving you alone.

17:44.525 --> 17:47.233
Well, there is the matter
of the paperwork to go over

17:47.317 --> 17:48.858
to make the, uh, adoption official,

17:48.942 --> 17:51.942
and, frankly, I would like
to take advantage

17:52.025 --> 17:55.567
of the Fickle Ferry's, uh, prehurricane
special reduced ticket prices.

17:55.650 --> 17:57.108
Yes, finish the paperwork

17:57.192 --> 17:58.483
and have a relaxing lunch.

17:58.567 --> 18:01.525
Captain Sham can come fetch us
at Aunt Josephine's house.

18:03.275 --> 18:05.567
I'll see you very soon.

18:07.692 --> 18:09.567
Save the fish heads!

18:09.650 --> 18:12.400
Storm's comin'!

18:14.317 --> 18:15.983
I can't understand what you're saying,

18:16.067 --> 18:18.983
but I assume that you think
we ought to decode Aunt Josephine's note

18:19.067 --> 18:21.733
before Count Olaf and Mr. Poe
finish the paperwork.

18:21.817 --> 18:24.775
But how are we gonna get all the way
back up to Aunt Josephine's house?

18:25.900 --> 18:28.275
Does anybody need a ride someplace
for a reasonable fee?

18:29.983 --> 18:33.275
Believe me, I've had
this conversation a million times.

18:33.358 --> 18:36.192
If you look at the white whale
in terms of postcolonialism...

18:36.275 --> 18:37.608
Thank you, sir.

18:38.692 --> 18:39.858
Call me Ishmael.

18:39.942 --> 18:43.150
We don't have much time
before Hurricane Herman arrives.

18:43.233 --> 18:45.983
- The library.
- Good idea. The library.

18:58.518 --> 18:59.043
Whuh?

18:59.567 --> 19:02.692
Got it. Sunny and I will take
baking soda baths to treat our hives,

19:02.775 --> 19:04.692
while you begin your research.

19:04.775 --> 19:07.108
Exactly. Nouns and verbs.

19:10.525 --> 19:12.858
And those moneys
are locked into the tuition fund.

19:12.942 --> 19:15.358
So the tuition fund cannot be spent,
for example,

19:15.442 --> 19:17.275
on a pair of diamond cufflinks?

19:19.108 --> 19:20.275
Just asking.

19:20.358 --> 19:23.525
All you do is saute
garlic and onions in a pot,

19:23.608 --> 19:27.567
then add onions, capers, anchovies,
diced parsley and tomatoes...

19:27.650 --> 19:29.108
Stop being friendly to him!

19:35.942 --> 19:38.650
Oa?e?aieyown Restaurant.
This is Larry, your waiter.

19:41.025 --> 19:43.442
Alive? Where?

19:44.483 --> 19:45.608
Peru?

19:46.317 --> 19:48.567
Secure for the moment,
but you need to know...

19:49.442 --> 19:50.733
Who is this?

19:57.317 --> 19:58.483
Hello?

20:01.108 --> 20:02.150
Hello?

20:02.942 --> 20:05.067
How does it work? Hello?

20:06.650 --> 20:10.192
- The restaurant's been compromised.
- We can't wait for the weather to clear.

20:10.275 --> 20:12.983
It's gonna take more than a hurricane
to keep us from our children.

20:13.067 --> 20:14.817
- Hurricane?
- Buckle up, darling.

20:14.900 --> 20:16.150
It's gonna be a bumpy flight.

20:26.025 --> 20:28.858
You were right, Klaus. A baking soda bath
did wonders for our hives.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.506
And it's relaxing.

20:30.525 --> 20:32.233
How's your swollen tongue?
And how's your research?

20:32.317 --> 20:33.900
My tongue is improving.

20:33.983 --> 20:36.650
- As for my research, see for yourselves.
- What is all this?

20:36.733 --> 20:38.650
It's Aunt Josephine's note.

20:38.733 --> 20:40.733
- Look, I-T-apostrophe-S.
- I remember.

20:40.817 --> 20:42.650
Aunt Josephine wrote "it's" as in "it is,"

20:42.733 --> 20:44.775
when she meant "its"
as in "belonging to it."

20:44.858 --> 20:47.525
That was just to get our attention.
But look at the second sentence.

20:47.608 --> 20:49.108
"My heart is as cold as Ike."

20:49.192 --> 20:52.275
But Aunt Josephine said she liked
to think of her husband someplace hot.

20:52.358 --> 20:54.067
"As cold as ice"
would make a lot more sense.

20:54.150 --> 20:56.983
Exactly! Unless these aren't
grammatical mistakes at all.

20:57.067 --> 21:00.358
They're a message. Aunt Josephine said
she and Ike developed secret codes.

21:00.442 --> 21:02.775
C for "ice" instead of "Ike."

21:02.858 --> 21:05.692
U for "unbearable"
instead of "inbearable."

21:05.775 --> 21:07.983
- R-D...
- L-E-D.

21:08.067 --> 21:10.275
Curdled Cave.

21:11.192 --> 21:12.317
That's where I got, too.

21:12.400 --> 21:14.942
But why would her last words
be about some cave?

21:15.025 --> 21:16.442
Maybe they're not her last words.

21:16.525 --> 21:19.192
What if she only wants
people to think that she's dead?

21:19.275 --> 21:21.025
People who don't care about
grammatical errors.

21:21.108 --> 21:22.442
- Like Count Olaf.
- Exactly.

21:22.525 --> 21:25.275
What if she's alive
and wants us to know where she's hiding?

21:25.358 --> 21:26.692
Curdled Cave.

21:27.317 --> 21:28.942
We have to find her.

21:29.525 --> 21:32.608
- How are we gonna get to the Curdled Cave?
- Look at the dotted line.

21:32.692 --> 21:35.067
It looks like the <i>Fickle Ferry</i>
goes to the Lavender Lighthouse,

21:35.150 --> 21:36.483
which is right next to the cave.

21:36.567 --> 21:39.650
I saw the schedule
when we arrived at Damocles Dock.

21:39.733 --> 21:41.817
The <i>Fickle Ferry</i> leaves every 17 minutes.

21:41.900 --> 21:43.275
Let's gather everything we might need.

21:44.608 --> 21:46.817
Klaus!

22:34.067 --> 22:35.192
Klaus!

22:46.650 --> 22:47.900
Klaus!

24:01.317 --> 24:06.567
And, finally, there is still the matter
of Aunt Josephine's house to take care of.

24:06.650 --> 24:07.733
- Right.
- Those forms

24:07.817 --> 24:10.608
need to be filled out in quintuplicate.

24:12.858 --> 24:13.942
Mmm!

24:17.608 --> 24:19.025
And then we can treat ourselves

24:19.108 --> 24:22.358
to my second favorite candy
when I was a boy, peppermints.

24:22.942 --> 24:24.650
During tourist season at Lake Lachrymose,

24:24.733 --> 24:27.400
the <i>Fickle Ferry</i> brings visitors
from all over the world

24:27.483 --> 24:28.608
to enjoy sunshine...

24:30.358 --> 24:31.358
fresh air...

24:32.400 --> 24:34.775
smoked mackerel. Mmm.

24:35.775 --> 24:38.567
The ferry leaves every 17 minutes
to the Lavender Lighthouse,

24:38.650 --> 24:40.525
where tourists can walk to Curdled Cave

24:40.608 --> 24:44.400
or they could bask in the lighthouse's
pale purple glow.

24:44.483 --> 24:46.025
But that's only when the weather is warm.

24:46.108 --> 24:49.525
During the off-season,
Lake Lachrymose has very few visitors,

24:49.608 --> 24:51.525
which is why the ferry company
has added two words

24:51.608 --> 24:53.442
to the bottom of their schedule
in fine print,

24:53.525 --> 24:54.650
a phrase which here means

24:54.733 --> 24:57.358
"you might miss reading it
until it was too late."

24:59.025 --> 25:00.983
- "Weather permitting."
- What does that mean?

25:01.067 --> 25:03.817
It means the Fickle Ferry isn't
running at all.

25:03.900 --> 25:06.317
Then how are we gonna get to Curdled Cave?

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
Pirate style.

25:11.775 --> 25:14.525
There is also fine print attached
to this sad tale.

25:14.608 --> 25:16.483
A number of concerned people are worried

25:16.567 --> 25:18.983
that if you watch the Baudelaire orphans
steal a sailboat

25:19.067 --> 25:22.442
and sail across Lake Lachrymose
in the middle of Hurricane Herman...

25:23.150 --> 25:24.483
We're gonna steal a sailboat,

25:24.567 --> 25:27.025
sail across Lake Lachrymose
in the middle of Hurricane Herman.

25:27.525 --> 25:30.067
you might be tempted
to do such a thing yourself.

25:32.942 --> 25:35.025
We're stealing these, too.

25:35.108 --> 25:37.192
So allow me to offer you
a piece of advice,

25:37.275 --> 25:39.150
even though
I don't know anything about you.

25:42.150 --> 25:44.858
Do not take a sailboat
that does not belong to you.

25:44.942 --> 25:47.275
We're just borrowing it.
We'll bring it back.

25:47.358 --> 25:49.233
And nobody will even know
what we're doing.

25:54.650 --> 25:57.692
And do not attempt to sail that sailboat
during a hurricane.

26:07.650 --> 26:09.192
Especially if, like the Baudelaires,

26:09.275 --> 26:11.983
you only have a vague idea
of how a sailboat works.

26:12.067 --> 26:14.150
I've read some aquatic literature.

26:14.233 --> 26:17.233
All we've got to do is use the sail
to catch the wind.

26:17.317 --> 26:19.483
I've seen this lever in naval blueprints.

26:19.567 --> 26:22.150
It's called the tiller.
It steers the ship.

26:22.233 --> 26:23.983
Now all we have to do
is sail across Lake LachrymoseÑúëçëèâîòî  åçåðî

26:24.067 --> 26:25.192
in the middle of a hurricane.

26:30.025 --> 26:32.150
Sailing across Lake Lachrymose
in a hurricane

26:32.233 --> 26:33.733
offers a plethora of challenges.

26:33.817 --> 26:37.442
"Plethora" is a word which here means
"too many to list," but I will try.

26:37.525 --> 26:39.858
Your boat might be tossed
into the Wicked Whirlpool...

26:39.942 --> 26:41.442
Mind the whirlpool!

26:42.442 --> 26:44.692
or dashed to bits
on the Rancorous Rocks.

26:44.775 --> 26:46.817
Watch out for the rocks!

26:46.900 --> 26:48.567
And even if you were lucky enough

26:48.650 --> 26:51.775
to spy the faint purple beam
of the Lavender Lighthouse...

26:53.851 --> 26:54.959
Look!

26:54.983 --> 26:56.400
It's the Lavender house.

26:57.567 --> 26:59.733
it would be an outright miracle
if your boat were not destroyed

26:59.817 --> 27:02.108
at the craggy entrance of Curdled Cave.

27:02.192 --> 27:04.108
Fortunately, the Baudelaires
were about to learn

27:04.192 --> 27:06.150
what any local weatherperson can tell you.

27:07.442 --> 27:09.483
All storms eventually break.

27:10.067 --> 27:11.525
Even Hurricane Herman.

27:21.525 --> 27:23.733
Lake Lachrymose is actually very pretty.

27:25.942 --> 27:27.442
I never noticed it before.

27:27.525 --> 27:30.442
I guess we got used to looking at it
through Aunt Josephine's eyes.

27:35.192 --> 27:37.233
Êèñåëàòàave is for sale.

27:37.317 --> 27:40.067
Who would want to live
in such a phantasmagorical place?

27:40.942 --> 27:43.650
What is that sound?

27:43.733 --> 27:45.858
Just the wind... probably.

27:46.442 --> 27:49.192
I read that when wind passes
through small spaces, like caves,

27:49.275 --> 27:52.817
it can make strange noises.
It's nothing to be afraid of.

27:52.900 --> 27:54.275
I'm afraid of it anyway.

27:55.775 --> 27:56.858
Me, too.

27:57.401 --> 27:59.401
Man up.

28:09.192 --> 28:11.567
Aunt Josephine?

28:11.650 --> 28:13.442
Are you...

28:13.525 --> 28:14.358
okay?

28:16.400 --> 28:21.567
You figured it out!
I knew you could figure it out.

28:21.650 --> 28:25.317
I knew you would decode my message.

28:25.442 --> 28:28.900
- Klaus really did it.
- But Violet knew how to work the sailboat.

28:28.983 --> 28:30.400
Without Violet,
we never would've made it here.

28:30.483 --> 28:31.775
Sunny spotted the lighthouse.

28:31.858 --> 28:35.192
Well, I am so glad to see all of you.

28:35.275 --> 28:39.442
Just let me catch my breath
and I'll help you bring in your things.

28:39.525 --> 28:42.483
- What things?
- Your luggage, of course.

28:43.192 --> 28:46.025
I hope you brought food. I'm out.

28:48.317 --> 28:50.858
- We didn't bring any food.
- No food?

28:50.942 --> 28:54.983
How in the world did you expect
to live with me in this cave

28:55.067 --> 28:56.858
if you didn't bring any food?

28:56.942 --> 28:58.733
We didn't come here to live with you.

28:58.817 --> 29:00.233
Then why did you come?

29:00.845 --> 29:02.126
Here we go again.

29:02.150 --> 29:05.442
Whatever word that was, Sunny,
it was grammatically incorrect.

29:05.525 --> 29:07.567
But maybe one of your siblings

29:07.650 --> 29:11.192
will explain in correct English
why you're here.

29:11.275 --> 29:13.733
Because Captain Sham
almost had us in his clutches.

29:13.817 --> 29:16.608
Everyone thought you were dead,
and in your will and testament,

29:16.692 --> 29:19.442
you wrote that we should be placed
in the care of Captain Sham.

29:19.525 --> 29:21.025
He forced me to do that.

29:23.650 --> 29:27.817
<i>We were only halfway through
our fried-egg sandwiches</i>

29:27.900 --> 29:31.317
<i>when Captain Sham told me
that he was really...</i>

29:32.317 --> 29:34.275
- Count Olaf.
<i>- Count Olaf.</i>

29:42.525 --> 29:47.858
<i>He said I had to write out a will saying
you children would be left in his care,</i>

29:47.942 --> 29:50.483
<i>or he would drown me in the lake.</i>

29:50.567 --> 29:53.692
<i>I was so frightened
that I agreed immediately,</i>

29:53.775 --> 29:58.108
<i>but hid a secret message
I hoped you children would find.</i>

30:00.525 --> 30:04.942
<i>Of course,
then I knew my life was truly in danger.</i>

30:05.692 --> 30:07.275
<i>I waited for my opportunity...</i>

30:16.900 --> 30:18.817
Come on.

30:25.442 --> 30:27.692
Here's Shammy!

30:36.692 --> 30:39.192
<i>And faked my own death.</i>

30:50.692 --> 30:53.275
Well, that... worked out.

31:15.692 --> 31:18.733
<i>It's a good thing</i>
<i>I remembered to put gas</i>

31:18.817 --> 31:22.025
<i>in my recreational watercraft.</i>

31:53.067 --> 31:54.692
- Aunt Josephine?
- Aunt Josephine?

31:54.775 --> 31:56.150
Why didn't you take us with you?

31:56.233 --> 31:58.650
Why did you leave us
all alone by ourselves?

31:58.733 --> 32:00.775
Why didn't you protect us
from Count Olaf?

32:00.858 --> 32:02.025
Oh, Violet...

32:03.192 --> 32:08.358
it is not grammatically correct
to say "leave us all alone by ourselves."

32:08.442 --> 32:13.442
You can say "leave us all alone,"
or "leave us by ourselves,"

32:13.525 --> 32:16.108
but not both. Do you understand?

32:16.645 --> 32:18.126
She's loony.

32:18.150 --> 32:22.942
That didn't sound grammatical either,
but we'll say no more about it.

32:23.025 --> 32:26.525
We have all had a very trying day,

32:26.608 --> 32:31.483
but I don't think Captain Sham
will ever find us here.

32:31.567 --> 32:35.442
We can share Curdled Cave
for the rest of our lives.

32:35.525 --> 32:36.650
We're not staying here.

32:36.733 --> 32:38.525
We're taking the sailboat
back to the town,

32:38.608 --> 32:39.942
and we're taking you with us.

32:40.025 --> 32:42.358
No way, Jose.

32:42.442 --> 32:45.733
I am too frightened of Count Olaf
to face him.

32:45.817 --> 32:48.067
But if you tell Mr. Poe what happened,

32:48.150 --> 32:51.775
then Count Olaf will be locked away
and we'll be safe, all of us.

32:51.858 --> 32:55.692
You can tell him that if you want.
I am staying here.

32:55.775 --> 32:59.400
He won't believe us unless you come along
and prove you're alive.

32:59.483 --> 33:05.442
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

33:05.525 --> 33:07.567
I am too afraid.

33:07.650 --> 33:09.317
We're all afraid.

33:09.400 --> 33:11.442
We were afraid
when you brought home Count Olaf.

33:11.525 --> 33:13.983
We were afraid when we thought
you had jumped out a window.

33:14.067 --> 33:16.650
We were afraid to give ourselves
allergic reactions,

33:16.733 --> 33:18.317
we were afraid to steal a sailboat,

33:18.400 --> 33:20.775
and we were afraid to make our way
across Lake Lachrymose

33:20.858 --> 33:22.108
in the middle of a hurricane.

33:22.192 --> 33:23.608
But that didn't stop us!

33:23.692 --> 33:26.983
I can't help it
if you are braver than I am.

33:27.067 --> 33:28.192
I can't do it.

33:28.775 --> 33:32.108
I am going to live here
for the rest of my life,

33:32.192 --> 33:35.942
and there is nothing you can say
that will change my mind.

33:40.775 --> 33:42.442
You know Curdled Cave is for sale.

33:44.442 --> 33:45.775
So what?

33:45.858 --> 33:49.900
Well, that just means that before long,

33:49.983 --> 33:53.317
certain people are going to want
to look at it.

33:54.233 --> 33:55.817
And some of those people...

33:57.608 --> 33:59.400
will be real estate agents.

34:01.650 --> 34:02.900
Okay, let's go.

34:10.608 --> 34:11.858
Uh-oh.

34:16.608 --> 34:17.692
Uh-oh.

34:21.067 --> 34:22.692
Uh-oh.

34:22.775 --> 34:25.317
Aunt Josephine, I really do wish
you'd stop saying that.

34:25.400 --> 34:27.775
Hurricane Herman is over,
the sailboat is working perfectly

34:27.858 --> 34:29.733
and we'll be back to Damocles Dock
by morning.

34:30.317 --> 34:32.150
We're as safe as can possibly be expected.

34:32.233 --> 34:33.317
Maybe...

34:34.525 --> 34:36.858
maybe you could think back to a time

34:36.942 --> 34:41.483
when you were a little more
fierce and formidable.

34:43.692 --> 34:46.608
- Where did you find this?
- In the library.

34:46.692 --> 34:49.525
I haven't seen this photograph in years.

34:50.233 --> 34:54.108
Lucky Smells Lumbermill.
Ah, it's not far from here.

34:54.525 --> 34:56.567
Oh, look at Ike.

34:56.650 --> 34:58.775
Look how handsome he looks in that hat.

34:58.858 --> 35:00.692
Oh, and look at Monty!

35:00.775 --> 35:02.775
- And our parents.
- Yes.

35:03.650 --> 35:05.025
And your parents.

35:06.025 --> 35:07.775
Such brave and noble people.

35:07.858 --> 35:11.817
- Oh, how I miss them.
- We miss them, too.

35:11.900 --> 35:14.567
But we have questions about them.

35:14.650 --> 35:17.400
They never told us about you.
They never told us about Uncle Monty.

35:17.483 --> 35:19.733
I have a feeling there's lots of things
they never told us about.

35:19.817 --> 35:25.733
Your parents, Baudelaires,
wanted to raise you in a quiet world,

35:25.817 --> 35:30.650
far away from the fiery injustices
that were threatening all of us.

35:30.733 --> 35:32.900
They were trying to keep you safe.

35:32.983 --> 35:35.942
- It didn't work.
- No. No, it didn't.

35:36.025 --> 35:38.983
Not long after this photograph was taken,

35:39.067 --> 35:42.525
your parents and I had to make
a vastly frightening decision.

35:42.608 --> 35:45.317
I remember that day so well, Klaus.

35:45.942 --> 35:49.983
Your mother had just wrestled
one of our enemies to the ground,

35:50.067 --> 35:52.817
when she turned to me and said...

35:53.317 --> 35:54.650
- Uh-oh.
- What?

35:55.233 --> 35:59.442
- Uh-oh. And I mean it this time.
- What's wrong?

35:59.525 --> 36:02.900
We are now entering the territory
of the Lachrymose Leeches.

36:02.983 --> 36:04.692
Oh, my poor Ike!

36:04.775 --> 36:10.650
He always loved shredded beef tamales,
and they ended up sealing his doom.

36:10.733 --> 36:11.817
I'm sure we'll be all right.

36:11.900 --> 36:14.025
You said that the leeches
were usually harmless.

36:14.108 --> 36:16.483
Unless you have recently eaten.

36:16.567 --> 36:20.525
We haven't eaten anything since those
peppermints at the Anxious Clown.

36:20.608 --> 36:23.317
That was brunch,
and it's almost morning now.

36:23.400 --> 36:25.858
You didn't eat anything recently,
did you, Aunt Josephine?

36:29.358 --> 36:30.400
Aunt Josephine?

36:31.233 --> 36:32.275
Banana.

36:33.192 --> 36:36.233
I ate a banana
just before you arrived.

36:37.650 --> 36:40.275
- Uh-oh.
- I'm sure there's nothing to worry about.

36:40.358 --> 36:41.817
Leeches are very small animals.

36:41.900 --> 36:43.983
If we were in the water,
we might have reason to fear,

36:44.067 --> 36:45.733
but I doubt they'd attack a sailboat.

36:45.817 --> 36:48.733
Hurricane Herman might have even
scared them out of the territory.

36:51.442 --> 36:52.442
Uh-oh.

37:03.525 --> 37:05.817
You see? We're perfectly safe.

37:05.900 --> 37:10.275
Yeah. Perfectly safe.
See? They're leaving.

37:15.233 --> 37:16.692
Whoa!

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
Uh oh.

37:21.525 --> 37:23.275
We're gonna need to sail
much, much faster,

37:23.358 --> 37:25.525
or this boat will be in pieces in no time.

37:25.608 --> 37:28.067
But sailing relies on wind.
We can't make the wind go any faster.

37:28.150 --> 37:31.942
Please don't throw me overboard!
I'm too frightened!

37:36.817 --> 37:38.817
Nobody's gonna throw you overboard.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
Dramatic irony?

37:57.400 --> 37:59.733
- Well, rowing's not gonna work.
- Rowing won't help anyway.

37:59.817 --> 38:01.525
This boat is sinking. We need help.

38:01.608 --> 38:03.233
How are we gonna get help
in the middle of a lake?

38:03.317 --> 38:04.983
We just need a signal.

38:12.400 --> 38:14.817
That's right, darling.
Close your eyes.

38:14.900 --> 38:16.733
That's what I do when I'm afraid.

38:16.817 --> 38:20.192
It always makes me feel better
to block out the fear.

38:20.275 --> 38:22.692
Let's all close our eyes,

38:22.775 --> 38:25.275
as if we're watching
some on-screen entertainment

38:25.358 --> 38:28.067
that's too scary for people our age.

38:28.150 --> 38:30.358
Violet's not blocking out anything.

38:30.900 --> 38:32.400
That's how she concentrates.

38:32.483 --> 38:33.525
Fire alarms.

38:34.567 --> 38:36.192
- What?
- Fire alarms.

38:36.275 --> 38:38.900
Oh, please don't say
any more scary things.

38:38.983 --> 38:40.108
I'm frightened enough.

38:40.192 --> 38:42.525
Fire alarms are an excellent way
to signal for assistance.

38:42.608 --> 38:44.692
We need noise, we need light.

38:49.108 --> 38:51.775
- We need to start a fire.
- Won't that get us in more danger?

38:51.858 --> 38:54.108
If we start a fire for light
and hit the bucket for noise,

38:54.192 --> 38:55.442
we can attract attention.

38:55.525 --> 38:57.567
It'll be hard to start a fire.
Everything here is...

38:59.775 --> 39:01.442
wet from the storm!

39:02.775 --> 39:05.733
Not everything.
Aunt Josephine, I need your scarf.

39:05.817 --> 39:09.358
No! I need it more.
I need it to protect my neck.

39:09.442 --> 39:12.067
I don't have time to argue with you.
I'm trying to save each of our lives!

39:12.150 --> 39:15.817
The expression is
"saving all of our lives"

39:15.900 --> 39:17.400
not "saving each of our... "

39:17.483 --> 39:19.775
Sit down!

39:21.025 --> 39:23.233
Oh, my God! Oh! Oh!

39:24.733 --> 39:26.150
How do we light this?

39:26.817 --> 39:30.650
Well, there's friction, but that requires
technique, patience and dry conditions.

39:30.733 --> 39:32.525
There has to be another way.

39:33.192 --> 39:35.650
The scientific principle of the divergence
and refraction of light.

39:35.733 --> 39:38.275
The scientific principle of the divergence
and refraction of light?

39:38.358 --> 39:40.858
The scientific principle of the divergence
and refraction of light.

39:40.942 --> 39:44.317
You know, when horrible people
use a magnifying glass to burn ants.

39:44.400 --> 39:45.567
Olaf used to do that.

39:46.150 --> 39:48.817
Theoretically, if I can catch
enough light from the lighthouse beam...

39:49.567 --> 39:51.525
- That seems unlikely.
- Just try your best.

39:51.608 --> 39:54.483
It doesn't matter if I try my best.
What matters is what happens.

39:56.108 --> 39:57.567
It won't work! The angle's wrong.

39:58.317 --> 40:00.983
The light just needs to refract off
of something else to reach us.

40:01.067 --> 40:02.858
There is nothing else. We're all alone.

40:19.400 --> 40:22.567
- I think I see something down there!
- If only we brought the spyglass.

40:24.108 --> 40:25.317
These will have to do.

40:33.525 --> 40:35.567
- You did it.
- We did it.

40:36.692 --> 40:37.983
It's a plane.

40:39.567 --> 40:41.733
Klaus, lower the sail.

40:47.567 --> 40:48.400
Help!

40:51.608 --> 40:53.025
Save me!

40:53.465 --> 40:54.584
Mayday!

40:54.608 --> 40:56.900
Save me!

40:56.983 --> 40:59.358
- Help! Help!
- Save me!

41:01.192 --> 41:02.650
It's a small boat in distress.

41:02.733 --> 41:06.025
Why would anybody be on the lake
so soon after a hurricane?

41:06.108 --> 41:08.067
Maybe they're trying
to reach their family, too.

41:08.150 --> 41:10.067
- They'll never make it.
- Unless we help them.

41:10.150 --> 41:12.400
I could fly low,
reduce our speed to 80 knots.

41:12.483 --> 41:13.817
We need to find a way to extract them.

41:13.900 --> 41:16.733
- I wish we had that grappling hook.
- Wait, ferry approaching.

41:16.817 --> 41:18.525
- Can it make it?
- Pulling up now!

41:19.692 --> 41:21.650
They'll be okay.

41:21.733 --> 41:24.067
Which might be
more than I can say about us.

41:28.650 --> 41:31.400
This might be a bit of a rough landing.
Brace yourself.

41:31.483 --> 41:32.692
I always do.

41:45.442 --> 41:46.525
We're saved!

41:46.608 --> 41:49.775
We are saved!

41:49.858 --> 41:52.358
Oh, my! Oh!

42:00.525 --> 42:03.525
Oh, my goodness.
What a relief.

42:03.608 --> 42:04.692
Oh!

42:04.775 --> 42:07.775
We don't know how to thank you.

42:09.650 --> 42:11.400
I can think of a way.

42:13.775 --> 42:14.900
Oh, no!

42:15.358 --> 42:20.567
You can stop faking your death
and running away and rescuing each other

42:20.650 --> 42:25.025
and making me ferry around
this godforsaken lake searching for you.

42:25.108 --> 42:27.067
Parenting is exhausting.

42:27.150 --> 42:29.400
You're not our parent
and you never will be.

42:29.983 --> 42:31.275
On the contrary,

42:31.358 --> 42:35.942
Mr. Poe is putting the finishing touches
on your adoption papers this very moment.

42:36.025 --> 42:40.150
In a few hours, you will be Violet,
Klaus and Sunny Sham.

42:40.233 --> 42:42.817
When we explain that you forced
Aunt Josephine to write that note,

42:42.900 --> 42:45.567
Mr. Poe will tear those adoption papers
into a thousand pieces.

42:45.650 --> 42:47.817
And who is Mr. Poe going to believe?

42:47.900 --> 42:51.817
The owner of a respectable
lakeside rental agency,

42:51.900 --> 42:56.400
or three runaway pip-squeaks
who go around stealing boats?

42:56.483 --> 42:59.358
We only stole that boat to retrieve
Aunt Josephine from her hiding spot

42:59.442 --> 43:01.858
so she could tell everybody
about your terrible plan.

43:05.442 --> 43:06.692
Is this true?

43:07.567 --> 43:08.733
Uh-huh.

43:08.817 --> 43:10.733
You were going to betray me?

43:10.817 --> 43:14.567
- Mmm.
- After all the years we spent together?

43:14.650 --> 43:17.192
After all of those picnics by the shore?

43:18.067 --> 43:22.942
After all of those shredded beef tamales
I served to your husband?

43:23.483 --> 43:27.317
After all the secrets we had shared?

43:31.775 --> 43:34.525
Yes! I was going to betray you,

43:34.608 --> 43:38.233
and these three children
gave me the courage to do so.

43:38.317 --> 43:42.317
Ever since their parents were killed,
they have been so fierce and formidable,

43:42.400 --> 43:45.275
again and again
escaping from your clutches.

43:45.358 --> 43:47.483
And what have I done all these years?

43:47.567 --> 43:51.233
Nothing but hide in my house.
Well, enough of that.

43:51.317 --> 43:55.358
My house can topple off a cliff
for all I care.

43:55.983 --> 43:56.858
Later.

43:56.942 --> 44:00.108
I am ready to be fierce
and formidable again myself,

44:00.192 --> 44:03.067
and to face you, Count Olaf!

44:04.900 --> 44:08.983
I have had enough of your schemes!
I have had enough of your plots!

44:09.067 --> 44:11.983
I have had enough
of your greed and your betrayal.

44:12.608 --> 44:16.275
Listen to me, Olaf,
you villain, you wretch,

44:16.858 --> 44:19.983
you vastly untalented actor!

44:21.317 --> 44:22.608
Ooh.

44:22.692 --> 44:25.692
I'm going to tell you something
I should've told you a long time ago.

44:25.775 --> 44:27.567
And what might that be?

44:27.650 --> 44:29.775
It's "have"!

44:30.650 --> 44:31.650
What?

44:31.733 --> 44:34.900
You said,
"After all the secrets we had shared."

44:34.983 --> 44:39.108
You should have said,
"After all the secrets we have shared."

44:39.192 --> 44:43.692
You made a serious grammatical error!

44:48.358 --> 44:51.025
Let me make sure I understand.

44:53.192 --> 44:54.900
You would not say,

44:54.983 --> 44:58.983
"Josephine Anwhistle had been
thrown overboard to the leeches,"

44:59.067 --> 45:01.067
because that would be incorrect.

45:01.150 --> 45:07.608
But if you said, "Josephine Anwhistle
has been thrown overboard to the leeches,"

45:07.692 --> 45:09.483
you would be all right with that?

45:09.567 --> 45:10.858
Yes.

45:11.358 --> 45:12.442
I mean...

45:12.942 --> 45:14.150
No!

45:15.442 --> 45:18.400
- I mean...
- I think I finally understand the lesson.

45:21.608 --> 45:23.358
Aunt Josephine!

45:23.442 --> 45:25.150
Fiends! All of you!

45:25.233 --> 45:27.358
Aunt Josephine!

45:30.150 --> 45:32.733
This does actually seem, like, a little...

45:32.817 --> 45:35.275
Take the boat to Damocles Dock!
Our work here is done.

45:35.775 --> 45:36.983
But Josephine?

45:37.067 --> 45:39.150
Josephine, Schmosephine.

45:40.233 --> 45:42.067
As I'm sure you know,
one way to demonstrate

45:42.150 --> 45:43.858
you don't care about something
is to say the word

45:43.942 --> 45:46.442
and then repeat the word
with the letters S-C-H-M

45:46.525 --> 45:48.150
replacing the real first letters.

45:50.775 --> 45:53.233
If you didn't care about
truth and justice, for example,

45:53.317 --> 45:56.275
you might say "truth, schmuth"
or "justice, schmustice."

45:56.775 --> 46:00.483
But as Count Olaf steered the Baudelaire
orphans away from the Leeches,

46:00.567 --> 46:03.442
their feelings about Aunt Josephine
were far more complicated.

46:03.525 --> 46:06.650
She had given them a home, even if it was
cold and not hurricane-proof.

46:06.733 --> 46:09.733
She had tried to teach them, even if
it wasn't what they wanted to learn.

46:09.817 --> 46:13.108
And like the Baudelaires,
she had experienced great loss.

46:13.192 --> 46:15.108
And while that doesn't make
a good guardian,

46:15.192 --> 46:17.192
it didn't make her a bad person.

46:17.275 --> 46:20.775
For this reason, the Baudelaires
did not think, "Josephine, Schmosephine."

46:20.858 --> 46:23.942
They thought...
"We hope Aunt Josephine is safe."

46:41.233 --> 46:42.608
Everybody off!

46:46.775 --> 46:48.692
- Klaus?
- Look.

46:57.025 --> 46:58.900
Lucky Smells Lumbermill.

46:58.983 --> 47:00.900
Aunt Josephine said it wasn't far.

47:01.858 --> 47:03.567
Come on. We don't have all day.

47:10.817 --> 47:12.567
What am I supposed to do with you?

47:12.650 --> 47:14.192
You said you were going
to go home and rest,

47:14.275 --> 47:17.483
but instead you steal a sailboat
and push Josephine's house down a hill?

47:17.567 --> 47:20.608
I missed the prehurricane discount
tickets and had to spend the night

47:20.692 --> 47:24.567
in a bed and breakfast
that uses powdered eggs!

47:24.650 --> 47:26.108
I wouldn't be surprised if Captain Sham

47:26.192 --> 47:28.733
was no longer interested
in serving as your guardian,

47:28.817 --> 47:30.983
even though I filled out
these forms in triplicate

47:31.067 --> 47:33.775
while he boated around Lake Lachrymose
looking for you on a hunch.

47:33.858 --> 47:34.692
I don't have a hunch.

47:35.275 --> 47:38.858
Well, I'll admit the children's behavior
did make me have second thoughts.

47:38.942 --> 47:40.400
But then I also had third thoughts,

47:40.483 --> 47:42.442
which are how empty
my wallet and my heart are.

47:43.025 --> 47:46.483
I truly think that the Baudelaires can be

47:46.567 --> 47:49.775
an enormous, enormous fortune in my life.

47:49.858 --> 47:53.817
And so...
as I used to say to my dearest friend,

47:53.900 --> 47:56.650
the late Josephine What's-her-name...

47:57.692 --> 48:00.483
- get in the car.
- We're not going anywhere with you.

48:00.567 --> 48:03.608
Mr. Poe, this man is really
Count Olaf in disguise.

48:03.692 --> 48:06.067
He murdered Aunt Josephine in cold blood.

48:06.150 --> 48:07.483
Uh, actually, cold water.

48:07.567 --> 48:10.525
Klaus, we've been through this.
There's absolutely nothing at this point

48:10.608 --> 48:12.775
that will convince me
that this man is actually Count Olaf.

48:12.858 --> 48:15.608
And you have no evidence
to support these wild accusations,

48:15.692 --> 48:17.900
and I cannot, on behalf
of Mulctuary Money Management,

48:17.983 --> 48:20.483
merely take the word of a single child.

48:20.567 --> 48:23.150
You don't have to take the word
of a single child.

48:23.233 --> 48:25.025
You can take the word of all three of us.

48:25.108 --> 48:28.317
Uh, actually, it's more like two.
The baby doesn't really count. I mean...

48:33.442 --> 48:34.900
My leg!

48:34.983 --> 48:38.108
My leg has grown back! It's amazing!

48:38.192 --> 48:40.108
It's incredible!

48:40.192 --> 48:42.608
It's wonderful! It's a medical miracle!

48:42.692 --> 48:44.233
It's a mitzvah!

48:44.317 --> 48:45.400
Oh, come now, that won't work.

48:45.483 --> 48:47.608
Even a child can see
that peg leg was false.

48:47.692 --> 48:49.900
A child did see
that the peg leg was false.

48:49.983 --> 48:52.775
- Three children, in fact.
- But you didn't listen.

48:52.858 --> 48:53.942
You never listen.

48:54.025 --> 48:56.983
Well, perhaps the peg leg was false.

48:57.067 --> 48:59.733
But I have never seen
this tattoo in my life.

48:59.817 --> 49:00.983
Oh, come now, that won't work either.

49:01.067 --> 49:02.983
You tried to hide the tattoo
with the peg leg.

49:04.942 --> 49:07.817
Maybe the tattoo is real.

49:07.900 --> 49:11.150
- But I am not this Count Olaf person.
- Look.

49:11.233 --> 49:12.650
Lucky Smells Lumbermill.

49:14.983 --> 49:16.817
- Let's go.
- My name is Captain Sham.

49:16.900 --> 49:18.192
It says so on my business card.

49:18.275 --> 49:20.317
Oh, oh, come now,
that won't work either again.

49:20.400 --> 49:21.817
Business cards don't prove anything.

49:21.900 --> 49:25.733
Anyone can go to a print shop and have
cards made up that say anything they like.

49:25.817 --> 49:32.817
Well, maybe I'm not Captain Sham,
but the children still belong to me.

49:33.108 --> 49:35.650
Josephine told me so.

49:35.733 --> 49:38.358
Oh, come now,
that won't work for the final time.

49:38.442 --> 49:41.858
Josephine left the children
to Captain Sham, not Count Olaf.

49:41.942 --> 49:45.067
You are Count Olaf and not Captain Sham.

49:45.150 --> 49:46.733
You are going to jail,

49:46.817 --> 49:49.317
and the children will come with me and
we'll settle this once and for...

49:50.483 --> 49:51.358
Baudelaires?

49:53.108 --> 49:54.442
Baudelaires?

49:55.733 --> 49:56.942
Baudelaire...

49:59.358 --> 50:01.025
Baudelaires!

50:02.317 --> 50:03.483
Baudelaires?

50:04.192 --> 50:05.108
Baudelaire...

50:06.650 --> 50:09.858
Baudelaires?
Well, I'll find them in a minute.

50:09.942 --> 50:12.900
You will stay here, Count Olaf,
and I'll finally contact the...

50:14.733 --> 50:15.775
Count Olaf!

50:16.358 --> 50:18.025
Count Olaf!

50:22.192 --> 50:23.483
I'm all alone.

50:27.150 --> 50:29.400
What's that thing Haruki Murakami said?

50:30.858 --> 50:31.942
"When you come out of the storm,

50:32.025 --> 50:34.233
you won't be the same person
who walked in."

50:34.317 --> 50:35.608
Before that part.

50:35.692 --> 50:38.025
"You won't even be sure, in fact...

50:38.608 --> 50:40.983
whether the storm is really over."

50:43.733 --> 50:45.692
Do you think we made the right choice?

50:45.775 --> 50:48.317
Doesn't matter
if we made the right choice.
