YOU USED TO DESCRIBE MY

46:19.540 --> 46:21.974
WORK--"PERFECT."

46:21.980 --> 46:24.244
YOU DONT SAY IT OUT LOUD BUT

46:24.250 --> 46:25.308
SOMETIMES YOU MUST THINK TO

46:25.310 --> 46:26.948
YOURSELF THAT CONNOR IS SO

46:26.950 --> 46:27.905
IMPERFECT.

46:27.910 --> 46:28.899

TENDER THINGS WITHOUT FEELING

46:47.530 --> 46:50.260
THE PAINFUL THINGS, TOO.

46:50.270 --> 46:51.874
YOU CANT HAVE ONE THING WITHOUT

46:51.880 --> 46:53.279
THE OTHER.

46:58.880 --> 47:00.438
MY MOTHER TOLD ME ONCE THAT SHE

47:00.440 --> 47:06.379
WISHED SHE HAD ABORTED ME.

47:06.390 --> 47:07.914
NATURALLY I WAS A PRETTY ANGRY

47:07.920 --> 47:11.890
KID...NOT UNLIKE YOUR SON.

47:18.960 --> 47:19.892

47:19.900 --> 47:24.837
CLINIC, SEAN AND I.

47:24.840 --> 47:30.267
CONNOR WAS A MISTAKE.

47:30.270 --> 47:32.909
WE WERE SEPARATED AT THE TIME,

47:32.920 --> 47:38.415
AND, UH, WE JUST GOT LONELY.

47:38.420 --> 47:42.254
I NEVER KNEW WHAT HAPPENED,

47:42.260 --> 47:43.284
BUT WE WERE SITTING THERE,

47:43.290 --> 47:48.387
AND WE JUST GOT UP AND LEFT.

47:48.390 --> 47:50.051
WE NEVER SAID IT TO EACH OTHER,

47:50.060 --> 47:55.134
BUT WE KNEW THAT THIS BABY WAS

47:55.140 --> 47:56.289
OUR LAST HOPE OF MAKING IT

47:56.300 --> 48:02.978
TOGETHER. GOD FORGIVE ME.

48:02.980 --> 48:04.072
I SHOULD HAVE GONE THROUGH WITH

48:04.080 --> 48:05.604
IT.

48:05.610 --> 48:08.078
I WISH I HAD.

48:13.390 --> 48:15.358
SEAN CANT HANDLE IT EITHER.

48:15.360 --> 48:17.658
YOU KNOW, HE ACTS LIKE HE CAN,

48:17.660 --> 48:19.309
BUT HE FEELS THE SAME WAY I DO.

48:19.320 --> 48:22.892
I KNOW IT. WE BLEW IT WITH OUR

48:22.900 --> 48:24.629
NORMAL, HEALTHY CHILD. WHAT HOPE
