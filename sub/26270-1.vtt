WEBVTT

00:01.369 --> 00:03.171
-9-1-1. What's your emergency?
-(siren wailing)

00:03.204 --> 00:05.206
Let's get him out of here
before this thing blows!

00:05.239 --> 00:07.041
Catch all-new episodes Mondays,

00:07.075 --> 00:08.842
and check out
our other Fox programs--

00:08.876 --> 00:12.012
Empire, The Resident,
and The Gifted.

00:12.046 --> 00:14.582
We are going to show you
the dawn of a new age.

00:14.615 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:20.521 --> 00:21.989
HOST (over radio): Hey, L.A.,
it's another scorcher here,

00:22.022 --> 00:23.524
and you know
what that means--

00:23.557 --> 00:25.059
earthquake weather.

00:25.093 --> 00:26.660
TOUR GUIDE:
Mulholland Drive named

00:26.694 --> 00:28.196
for William Mulholland,

00:28.229 --> 00:29.597
the man who brought water to

00:29.630 --> 00:31.165
-a thirsty desert.
-(horns honking)

00:31.199 --> 00:33.767
HOST (over radio):
It'll be 98 downtown,

00:33.801 --> 00:35.069
113 in the Valley.

00:35.103 --> 00:38.206
-Three more fiesta combos!
-* Pressure...

00:38.239 --> 00:40.007
HOST (over radio):
And in the Inland Empire,

00:40.040 --> 00:42.743
a million degrees,
give or take.

00:42.776 --> 00:44.678
-* Pressure...
-(sighs)

00:44.712 --> 00:46.080
So keep cool, stay inside,

00:46.114 --> 00:47.581
unless you're one of
the thousands

00:47.615 --> 00:49.350
without power right now,

00:49.383 --> 00:51.752
in which case,
have you thought about moving?

00:51.785 --> 00:53.787
Think I picked the wrong week
to be trained.

00:53.821 --> 00:55.523
Everything after this
will be a cakewalk.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.024
Get the cones set up.

00:57.057 --> 00:59.693
* Where the only thing you feel
are loaded guns *

00:59.727 --> 01:01.929
-* In your face
-(horn blares)

01:01.962 --> 01:03.564
* And you'll have to deal *

01:03.597 --> 01:05.533
-Go, ass wipe!
-* With pressure...

01:05.566 --> 01:07.368
(engine revving,
tires squealing)

01:07.401 --> 01:11.139
-(people gasp)
-Seriously?

01:11.172 --> 01:12.640
(engine revving)

01:13.907 --> 01:16.910
(church bells chiming)

01:16.944 --> 01:20.047
* You used to call me

01:20.080 --> 01:21.549
-* Paranoid
-(whistling)

01:21.582 --> 01:23.984
* Pressure

01:24.017 --> 01:27.087
I said it's gonna be at least
24 hours, all right?

01:27.121 --> 01:28.256
-(horn honking)
-Hey, and if you look

01:28.289 --> 01:31.625
to your right,
there's a real L.A. douchebag!

01:31.659 --> 01:33.761
(tires squealing)

01:33.794 --> 01:36.930
Andy! You bastard!

01:36.964 --> 01:39.233
-(cans clinking)
-* Now here you are

01:39.267 --> 01:42.636
-* With your faith...
-Hey, guys, I need that order.

01:42.670 --> 01:44.838
* You have no scars...

01:44.872 --> 01:46.140
(overlapping chatter)

01:46.174 --> 01:47.641
-(horn honks)
-MAN: Get out of the road!

01:47.675 --> 01:48.942
Let me over, man!

01:48.976 --> 01:50.911
-(horn honking)
-(screaming)

01:50.944 --> 01:53.347
(people screaming)

01:53.381 --> 01:54.582
Mikey, wait!

01:54.615 --> 01:56.717
(people gasp)

01:59.320 --> 02:02.055
(screaming)

02:09.730 --> 02:13.267
(siren wailing)

02:13.301 --> 02:15.503
* What do you know?

02:15.536 --> 02:21.442
* All your life is Channel 13

02:21.475 --> 02:23.644
* Sesame Street

02:23.677 --> 02:26.214
-(horn blaring)
-* What does it mean?

02:26.247 --> 02:28.616
(loud, overlapping
crowd chatter)

02:28.649 --> 02:30.184
(dog barking)

02:30.218 --> 02:31.485
Was I speeding, Officer?

02:31.519 --> 02:34.488
Hell yeah, you were speeding,
and in a stolen car.

02:34.522 --> 02:36.357
What? No, this is a rental.

02:36.390 --> 02:39.193
-Yeah, sure it is.
-(car horn honking)

02:39.227 --> 02:41.229
(honking continues)

02:41.262 --> 02:42.996
Take me to jail... now.

02:43.030 --> 02:46.066
* You're all alone,
pressure... *

02:46.099 --> 02:47.701
Oh, God. Please.

02:47.735 --> 02:51.805
* You'll have to answer
to your own *

02:51.839 --> 02:53.474
* Pressure...

02:53.507 --> 02:57.144
Excuse me. Do you know
if anyone famous lives here?

02:57.177 --> 02:59.313
Ma'am, I'm going to ask you
to keep your distance.

02:59.347 --> 03:01.215
But you don't know
what he did to me!

03:01.249 --> 03:03.984
Actually, I'm getting a pretty
good idea. You're the one

03:04.017 --> 03:05.519
who reported
this vehicle stolen?

03:05.553 --> 03:07.488
Why?

03:07.521 --> 03:08.889
* Nowhere to look

03:08.922 --> 03:10.824
* But inside

03:10.858 --> 03:15.363
* Where we all respond
to pressure... *

03:16.864 --> 03:18.532
Oh, God, it burns.

03:18.566 --> 03:21.435
I imagine it does.

03:21.469 --> 03:23.704
(crowd chatter)

03:27.375 --> 03:29.343
(man groans)

03:29.377 --> 03:30.844
I got it.

03:30.878 --> 03:33.146
(sighing)

03:34.415 --> 03:36.016
I need ice.

03:36.049 --> 03:39.219
(crowd murmuring)

03:41.789 --> 03:43.223
* Pressure!

03:43.257 --> 03:48.962
* I'm sure you'll have
some cosmic rationale *

03:48.996 --> 03:52.866
* But here you are
with your faith *

03:52.900 --> 03:55.369
* And your Peter Pan advice...

03:55.403 --> 03:59.239
A DWP worker says the likely
cause was frayed cables.

03:59.273 --> 04:02.710
Day like this,
they get overheated,

04:02.743 --> 04:05.078
-start to smolder.
-Yeah, they do.

04:05.112 --> 04:07.315
And with the buildup
of combustibles getting

04:07.348 --> 04:10.718
trapped underground, when
that manhole cover got pulled...

04:10.751 --> 04:12.486
Oxygen rushed in, and boom.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.988
(laughs)
Yeah, boom.

04:18.191 --> 04:21.194
* One, two, three, four,
pressure... *

04:25.466 --> 04:26.934
Looking good, Sam.

04:26.967 --> 04:29.503
You make that shine, Tanika.

04:29.537 --> 04:31.605
Outstanding haircut, Martin.

04:31.639 --> 04:33.407
You are cheery.

04:33.441 --> 04:35.108
-Why shouldn't I be?
-I don't know.

04:35.142 --> 04:36.577
Maybe 'cause you've been
like this for weeks,

04:36.610 --> 04:38.011
and it's starting
to get on my nerves.

04:38.045 --> 04:39.246
What's going on with you?

04:39.279 --> 04:41.081
BUCK:
I got another DXA scan,

04:41.114 --> 04:43.617
and guess who dropped
another half percent.

04:43.651 --> 04:46.687
-What?
-A DXA scan measures
your body fat.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.589
You can see your percentage
in every part of your body.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.591
Oh, yeah? They measure
the fat in your head?

04:50.624 --> 04:54.161
Ah, see, that would be funny,
but we're about a week away

04:54.194 --> 04:57.331
from submissions being due for
the Hot Days, Smoldering Nights:

04:57.365 --> 05:00.033
Men of the LAFD wall calendar,
and I'm already

05:00.067 --> 05:01.869
at my goal weight,
so it seems like

05:01.902 --> 05:03.937
my head is clearly
working perfectly.

05:03.971 --> 05:06.340
Do you really need
to use that whole title?

05:06.374 --> 05:08.342
You could just just say
"that idiotic, reductive,

05:08.376 --> 05:10.944
"sexist calendar that insults
the dignity of this organization

05:10.978 --> 05:13.246
and furthers the myth
that all firefighters are male."

05:14.582 --> 05:17.518
Yeah, that's not any less words.

05:17.551 --> 05:18.952
Hen, come on, it's for charity.

05:18.986 --> 05:21.121
-No. Bobby, you, too?
-Well, why not?

05:21.154 --> 05:23.691
They say a man is at his sexiest
when he reaches 50.

05:23.724 --> 05:25.292
Is that what they say?
That's what they say?

05:25.325 --> 05:26.827
CHIMNEY:
Okay, you're both wrong.

05:26.860 --> 05:28.496
All right? You see,
I think sorority houses

05:28.529 --> 05:30.564
all across
this great nation are ready

05:30.598 --> 05:32.866
for a new Asian sex symbol.

05:32.900 --> 05:35.302
-It's our time.
-I think it's great.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.505
You know? I like that
you're both going up for it.

05:37.538 --> 05:40.508
Oh, because you don't think
that we have a chance.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.209
Whoa, did I say that?

05:42.242 --> 05:43.811
I mean, sure, let's be real.

05:43.844 --> 05:47.648
They are only picking one
candidate from each station.

05:47.681 --> 05:50.317
Okay. That is a beautiful man.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.985
Where's the lie?

05:52.019 --> 05:54.822
And I like girls.

05:54.855 --> 05:58.191
* What a man, what a man, what
a man, what a mighty good man *

05:58.225 --> 05:59.727
* You got to say it
again now... *

05:59.760 --> 06:01.328
Who the hell is that?

06:01.361 --> 06:03.063
It's Eddie Diaz. New recruit.

06:03.096 --> 06:05.433
Graduated top of his class
just this week.

06:05.466 --> 06:07.234
Guys over at Station Six
were dying to have him,

06:07.267 --> 06:08.936
but I convinced him to join us.

06:08.969 --> 06:11.004
-What do we need him for? Um...
-(laughter)

06:11.038 --> 06:13.006
He served multiple tours
in Afghanistan as an Army medic.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.508
Guy's got a Silver Star.

06:14.542 --> 06:16.009
It's not like
he's wet behind the ears.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.377
Come on,
I'll introduce you to him.

06:17.411 --> 06:19.079
He likes to be called
Eight Pack.

06:19.112 --> 06:21.048
Wow. Silver Star.

06:21.081 --> 06:23.216
Better drop some more
body fat there, butch.

06:24.785 --> 06:26.854
-HEN: Hi.
-Hey.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.021
BOBBY:
Eddie, this is Hen. Hen, Eddie.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.189
EDDIE:
Nice to meet you.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.424
I'm short-staffed today.

06:30.458 --> 06:32.192
MAN (over phone):
It's not my fault

06:32.225 --> 06:33.727
-you can't run your business.
-Look, I'm not saying

06:33.761 --> 06:34.895
that it's your fault.

06:34.928 --> 06:36.396
All right?
It's no one's fault.

06:36.430 --> 06:38.198
-Actually, it's your fault.
-Okay, it is my fault.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.033
-You know what?
I'm going on Yelp,
-But I did say...

06:40.067 --> 06:42.035
-and trashing
your little tire shop.
-...Wednesday or Thursday.

06:42.069 --> 06:43.370
Please do not do that, sir.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.405
We rely on Yelp
for new business.

06:45.439 --> 06:47.274
-Whatever. I'm going on Yelp
right now.
-I understand

06:47.307 --> 06:49.543
that you are upset, and I'm
gonna do everything in my power

06:49.577 --> 06:51.712
to make sure I have it for you
by the end of the day today

06:51.745 --> 06:52.880
Damn right you will.

06:52.913 --> 06:55.716
-Yes, sir.
-My car better be ready.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.585
You have a good day.

06:58.819 --> 07:01.288
Dick.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.761
(screams)

07:07.795 --> 07:11.098
EMPLOYEE:
Hector! Aw, geez.

07:11.131 --> 07:12.633
Somebody help us!

07:20.874 --> 07:23.611
(siren wailing)

07:23.644 --> 07:25.946
So, Silver Star, huh?

07:25.979 --> 07:28.949
Yeah.

07:28.982 --> 07:31.284
You save a platoon
or something?

07:31.318 --> 07:32.820
No, no, nothing like that.

07:32.853 --> 07:34.755
Uh, just a convoy.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.356
(siren wailing, horn blaring)

07:36.389 --> 07:39.493
Eddie, uh, you heard about
the hot firefighter calendar?

07:42.029 --> 07:44.264
-Sorry, the what?
-It's for charity.

07:44.297 --> 07:45.499
(laughs)

07:46.867 --> 07:50.170
-So is your full name "Eduardo"?
-No.

07:50.203 --> 07:52.272
People ever call you "Diaz"?

07:52.305 --> 07:54.341
Not if they want me to respond.

07:54.374 --> 07:56.610
Something's got to give.
We got... we got Cap, Hen,

07:56.644 --> 07:59.446
Chimney, Buck.
We can't just call you "Eddie."

07:59.479 --> 08:01.448
Can't tell if he's being
serious or not.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.150
I like to always operate
under the assumption

08:03.183 --> 08:05.385
that nothing he says is serious.

08:05.418 --> 08:07.287
EMPLOYEE:
The air nozzle

08:07.320 --> 08:08.689
is embedded in his ass cheek.

08:08.722 --> 08:11.058
I shut it off,
but I was afraid to move him.

08:11.091 --> 08:13.126
Okay, Hector, can you hear me?

08:13.160 --> 08:14.461
All right, hang in there, buddy.

08:14.494 --> 08:15.963
All right,
let's get him on his side.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.164
Maintain pressure on the wound.

08:17.197 --> 08:18.832
On three. One, two, three.

08:18.866 --> 08:21.301
-(screaming)
-Okay. Easy, easy.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.136
It's a hundred pounds
per square inch of air

08:23.170 --> 08:24.504
pumped through his entire body.

08:24.538 --> 08:26.674
Breathing's shallow,
heart's racing.

08:26.707 --> 08:30.578
Air's filled his stomach, his
chest, even behind his eyelids.

08:30.611 --> 08:31.879
I'm more concerned
about the space

08:31.912 --> 08:33.146
around his heart and lungs.

08:33.180 --> 08:34.548
Okay, Eddie,
start a nasal cannula.

08:34.582 --> 08:37.184
-Chimney, get him some morphine.
-I'm on it.

08:38.886 --> 08:41.221
It's like trying to inject
a needle into stone.

08:41.254 --> 08:43.557
EDDIE: The pressure's
pushing everything out.

08:43.591 --> 08:45.693
I can't even get air
through the nostril.

08:45.726 --> 08:48.328
Jugular venous distention,
tachycardia, hypotension,

08:48.361 --> 08:50.564
diminished breath, we're looking
at tension pneumothorax.

08:50.598 --> 08:51.732
The air pressure
is collapsing his organs.

08:51.765 --> 08:53.400
We need to get in there
and drain the fluid.

08:53.433 --> 08:55.335
Buck, I need you to get
a 14-gauge angiocath.

08:55.368 --> 08:57.337
We need to start decompressing
the pleural cavity.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.172
All right, all right.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.875
-EDDIE: Want me to help?
-I got it.

09:01.909 --> 09:03.577
Hang in there, Hector.

09:03.611 --> 09:05.278
I'd go lower.

09:05.312 --> 09:07.948
What? Um, no.
Second intercostal space.

09:07.981 --> 09:09.382
Midclavicular line.

09:09.416 --> 09:11.051
The chest wall is thinner
at the fifth intercostal

09:11.084 --> 09:12.686
at the anterior axillary line.

09:12.720 --> 09:14.521
There's a decreased chance
of injuring any vital organs.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.890
I've-I've treated guys
with collapsed lungs in combat.

09:16.924 --> 09:18.792
-Do it.
-Please.

09:18.826 --> 09:20.293
Thank you.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.330
Can you help me out
with the shirt?

09:40.981 --> 09:43.684
(air escaping)

09:46.787 --> 09:50.057
-(gasps)
-BOBBY: That's it, Hector.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.059
Breathe, nice and slow.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.526
(panting)

10:02.435 --> 10:03.771
I mean, he swelled up.

10:03.804 --> 10:05.773
How you doing, Hector?

10:05.806 --> 10:08.441
(passing gas)

10:08.475 --> 10:11.078
Pressure's got to go somewhere.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.246
It always does.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.448
(continues passing gas)

10:17.617 --> 10:19.252
That was a good call, Eddie.

10:19.286 --> 10:21.789
-Thanks, Cap.
-Nice job.

10:23.891 --> 10:25.926
Yeah. Good call.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.128
(siren wailing in distance)

10:32.632 --> 10:34.735
(shower running)

10:49.582 --> 10:51.518
(laughs softly)

11:07.067 --> 11:08.635
-(screaming)
-Oh!

11:08.668 --> 11:09.636
Maddie?

11:09.669 --> 11:10.838
Damn it, Evan! Don't you knock?

11:10.871 --> 11:13.073
Me? What-what are you
even doing here?

11:13.106 --> 11:16.243
Well, I was in town, and I
wanted to see my little brother.

11:16.276 --> 11:19.179
-Well, you did.
-Yeah.

11:19.212 --> 11:21.081
(laughs)
I should probably...

11:21.114 --> 11:22.850
-Okay.
-Okay, I'm gonna...

11:22.883 --> 11:24.584
Uh-huh. Yep. Yep. Yeah.

11:24.617 --> 11:26.253
(sighs)

11:32.092 --> 11:35.328
BUCK: You think there
is any way we can unsee that?

11:35.362 --> 11:37.831
Oh, come on.
I used to give you baths.

11:37.865 --> 11:39.399
Yeah, when I was two.

11:39.432 --> 11:41.869
Hey, how did you even
get in here?

11:41.902 --> 11:44.337
I told the building manager
I was your sister.

11:44.371 --> 11:45.705
And he just believed you.

11:45.739 --> 11:49.009
Well, having boobs doesn't hurt.

11:49.042 --> 11:51.444
How'd you know where I live?

11:51.478 --> 11:53.680
Well, first,
I went to the address

11:53.713 --> 11:55.115
the Christmas cards keep
coming from,

11:55.148 --> 11:56.750
and the guy said you were here.

11:56.784 --> 12:00.020
Wait. So you did get
those Christmas cards?

12:00.053 --> 12:03.456
I'm sorry I haven't been
in touch much lately.

12:03.490 --> 12:05.525
Three years, Maddie.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.727
I haven't heard from you
in three years.

12:07.761 --> 12:09.062
Yeah, I know.

12:09.096 --> 12:10.630
And it's not what I wanted.

12:11.832 --> 12:13.967
Where is Doug?

12:14.001 --> 12:16.736
Don't know, don't care.

12:16.770 --> 12:18.906
You left him?

12:18.939 --> 12:20.073
Finally.

12:20.107 --> 12:21.541
Geez, Madds.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.576
Come on, what took you so long?

12:23.610 --> 12:25.645
What can I say? Mom was right.

12:25.678 --> 12:27.781
-Do they know?
-No one knows.

12:27.815 --> 12:29.749
And please don't tell them
if they call.

12:29.783 --> 12:31.484
I don't want anyone to know
that I'm here.

12:31.518 --> 12:33.153
Kind of sounds like
you're hiding out.

12:33.186 --> 12:35.889
No. More like laying low.

12:35.923 --> 12:37.590
So what happened to you?

12:37.624 --> 12:40.560
Because this place is nice,
and clean,

12:40.593 --> 12:43.263
and you just cooked me food,
actual food.

12:43.296 --> 12:44.731
Is there a shallot in here?

12:44.764 --> 12:48.335
Yeah, my, uh... my boss at work
is like Guy Fieri.

12:48.368 --> 12:49.669
He's been teaching me.

12:49.702 --> 12:52.439
Uh, we have not made it
past breakfast, though.

12:52.472 --> 12:54.241
And this is, uh--
let me show you--

12:54.274 --> 12:55.943
this is my girlfriend's place.

12:55.976 --> 12:57.845
I'm, uh... I'm looking after it
while she's out of town

12:57.878 --> 13:00.981
for a couple months, but, uh,
she-she should be back soon.

13:01.014 --> 13:02.983
-This is her.
-Aw.

13:03.016 --> 13:04.117
How soon?

13:04.151 --> 13:05.652
Uh, I'm not really sure.

13:05.685 --> 13:08.822
Um, she was in Ireland,
and now she's in Italy.

13:08.856 --> 13:11.358
Said she's looking to have
an Eat, Pray, Love experience.

13:11.391 --> 13:14.461
Uh, to be honest, I don't
really know what that means.

13:14.494 --> 13:15.829
But you're still together?

13:15.863 --> 13:17.865
Yeah. I mean, I mean,
she said I should,

13:17.898 --> 13:21.268
you know, do whatever I wanted
while she was away, but...

13:21.301 --> 13:23.370
what I want is for her
to come back.

13:23.403 --> 13:25.638
I like the me
that I am with her.

13:26.573 --> 13:28.108
She's banging other guys.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.277
-I mean, that's the "love" part
of her trip.
-Whoa!

13:30.310 --> 13:31.711
(laughs) Come on.

13:31.744 --> 13:34.347
So you did come all the way
from Pennsylvania to just

13:34.381 --> 13:35.615
crap on my life?
That's a thing?

13:35.648 --> 13:38.318
No, I'm sorry.
I'm just being protective.

13:38.351 --> 13:40.353
-Okay.
-(laughs)

13:40.387 --> 13:42.822
Anyway, uh, this is your
first time here in L.A.

13:42.856 --> 13:45.292
Gonna see the sights,
hang around for a little bit?

13:45.325 --> 13:47.660
I'm just passing through.

13:50.097 --> 13:54.334
Listen, even if you are
just here for a few days,

13:54.367 --> 13:57.804
uh, welcome to L.A.

13:57.837 --> 14:00.040
It was getting pretty lonely
around here.

14:05.946 --> 14:07.480
ATHENA:
That's right, Desna.

14:07.514 --> 14:10.483
Show Uncle Daddy
who the real daddy is.

14:10.517 --> 14:13.320
(laughs)
Ooh, I got to tweet that.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.155
-What?
-Oh, oh.

14:15.188 --> 14:16.356
Can we just watch the show?

14:16.389 --> 14:17.991
That's your fourth tweet
this episode.

14:18.025 --> 14:21.728
Mm-hmm. Me and my girls,
we always live-tweet Claws.

14:21.761 --> 14:23.363
Mm-hmm. These are
your friends, huh?

14:23.396 --> 14:26.499
Ah, my Twitter Claws
friends-friends.

14:26.533 --> 14:27.867
-Huh.
-(chuckles)

14:32.139 --> 14:34.174
-What?
-I've just never known anybody

14:34.207 --> 14:36.343
who's so engaged
in the viewing experience.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.611
(chuckles)
That's 'cause you've never been

14:38.645 --> 14:40.680
out to the movies in Crenshaw.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.215
Well, let's do that then.

14:42.249 --> 14:43.550
Do what?

14:43.583 --> 14:45.785
Let's go out into the world
as a couple.

14:45.818 --> 14:48.688
(scoffs) Have you been
outside lately?

14:48.721 --> 14:51.524
We are out in that world
all day.

14:51.558 --> 14:54.127
I want to keep it
on the other side of that door

14:54.161 --> 14:55.628
for a little while.

14:55.662 --> 14:59.432
(sighs) Just enjoy this
while we can,

14:59.466 --> 15:04.037
just the two of us.
(moans) No pressure.

15:04.071 --> 15:08.208
Ooh, Niecy Nash should be
on Mount Rushmore.

15:08.241 --> 15:12.212
Mm. (laughs)

15:12.245 --> 15:15.482
* I don't know
what you've been told *

15:15.515 --> 15:18.551
* But this here
is not your home *

15:18.585 --> 15:22.055
* If you want some trouble

15:22.089 --> 15:23.991
* You want some

15:24.024 --> 15:27.927
* Come on in
and I'll take hold *

15:27.961 --> 15:31.398
* These hands
will break your bones *

15:31.431 --> 15:36.303
* If you want some trouble,
you... *

15:36.336 --> 15:39.606
* When I see you

15:39.639 --> 15:42.409
* I see, I see

15:42.442 --> 15:45.345
* Blood in the water, ooh

15:45.378 --> 15:46.746
* Run deep

15:46.779 --> 15:49.849
-* Ooh...
-(panting)

15:51.351 --> 15:52.585
(camera clicks)

15:52.619 --> 15:54.187
You're in the wrong light, man.

15:54.221 --> 15:56.956
Some of us don't need
lighting to look good.

15:58.291 --> 15:59.826
(grunts)

15:59.859 --> 16:02.195
Hey, Eddie, what'd you mean
by "the wrong light"?

16:02.229 --> 16:04.597
The light in this room
is flat and blue.

16:04.631 --> 16:05.999
Makes you look soft.

16:06.033 --> 16:08.301
If you want to look lean
and muscles to pop,

16:08.335 --> 16:11.171
you need warm side light.
I'll show you.

16:12.739 --> 16:15.342
These are the ones I sent in
for the calendar.

16:15.375 --> 16:18.045
CHIMNEY:
Whoa.

16:18.078 --> 16:19.879
BUCK:
It's, uh, kind of cheating

16:19.912 --> 16:22.982
submitting pictures by
a professional photographer.

16:23.016 --> 16:26.119
(chuckles)
The photographer's 12.

16:26.153 --> 16:27.220
She's my niece.

16:27.254 --> 16:29.022
She's a master
at the iPhone filters.

16:29.056 --> 16:30.857
-CHIMNEY: Your niece did this?
-EDDIE: Yeah.

16:30.890 --> 16:33.360
You think she'd be willing to
take my submission pics for me?

16:33.393 --> 16:36.696
I'm told I photograph
like a Asian Fabio.

16:36.729 --> 16:38.631
-Sure she would, yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah?

16:38.665 --> 16:39.966
BUCK:
Ah, you know, you really

16:39.999 --> 16:41.701
shouldn't get his hopes up
like that.

16:41.734 --> 16:43.570
(Buck grunts)

16:43.603 --> 16:44.804
No offense, Chim.

16:44.837 --> 16:47.207
No offense taken, Evan.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.977
BUCK:
Yeah, come on.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.046
What's your problem, man?

16:57.184 --> 16:58.951
Okay. You.

17:00.253 --> 17:02.989
You're my problem.
Your comfort level.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.325
You're-you're not supposed
to just walk in here

17:05.358 --> 17:06.826
like you've been here for years.

17:06.859 --> 17:09.829
It's meant-meant to be
a getting-to-know-you period.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.831
You're meant
to respect your elders.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.633
You're not his elder, Buck.

17:14.901 --> 17:18.605
Look, I in no way meant
to, uh, be too familiar

17:18.638 --> 17:20.440
or step on anybody's toes.

17:20.473 --> 17:22.875
I know you're going through
some personal stuff right now.

17:22.909 --> 17:24.944
-What personal stuff?
-I know your girlfriend

17:24.977 --> 17:26.012
recently broke up with you

17:26.045 --> 17:28.248
and you're coming
to terms with that.

17:28.281 --> 17:30.350
No, I'm not.
And she didn't break up with me.

17:30.383 --> 17:31.351
Who told you that?

17:31.384 --> 17:34.020
(grunting): 21.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.223
I'm just saying I hear
you're a good guy, and...

17:36.256 --> 17:38.091
I'm sorry you're going
through pain, but...

17:38.125 --> 17:39.726
you don't need
to take it out on me

17:39.759 --> 17:41.694
or-or be threatened by me.
We're on the same team.

17:41.728 --> 17:44.030
Why would I be
threatened by you?

17:44.063 --> 17:47.634
Exactly. There's no need to be.

17:47.667 --> 17:50.137
We do the same thing.

17:50.170 --> 17:53.840
I've just done it while people
are shooting at me is all.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.709
We're not broken up.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.545
All right.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.913
(laughs)

18:18.165 --> 18:19.966
Fire and Rescue. Hello.

18:19.999 --> 18:22.569
CHARLIE (muffled):
I'm back here. Help me.

18:22.602 --> 18:23.736
BUCK:
Some kind of militia nut?

18:23.770 --> 18:25.172
CHARLIE (muffled):
I'm back...

18:25.205 --> 18:26.739
BOBBY: Can't tell where
that voice is coming from.

18:26.773 --> 18:27.907
CHARLIE (muffled):
Back here.

18:27.940 --> 18:31.244
-Oh, thank God.
-Hey.

18:31.278 --> 18:34.247
-What's your name, sir?
-Charlie.

18:34.281 --> 18:36.149
All right, tell us
what happened, Charlie.

18:36.183 --> 18:38.585
Damn grenade went off
while I was taking it apart.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.287
Why are you taking apart
a grenade?

18:40.320 --> 18:42.289
I was cleaning it.
I'm a collector.

18:42.322 --> 18:43.523
No kidding.

18:43.556 --> 18:44.924
You pulled the pin?

18:44.957 --> 18:46.326
Oh, it ain't that kind
of grenade.

18:46.359 --> 18:48.094
It's a 40-mike-mike.

18:48.127 --> 18:51.964
A practice round
for an M203 grenade launcher.

18:51.998 --> 18:54.501
I picked it up
at a flea market in Brea,

18:54.534 --> 18:56.102
part of my 'Nam collection.

18:56.135 --> 18:59.372
My screwdriver must have touched
the propelling charge. I...

18:59.406 --> 19:01.608
All right, I see metal.
A lot of shrapnel.

19:01.641 --> 19:02.675
Femoral artery has been nicked.

19:02.709 --> 19:04.211
We got to get him
transported now.

19:04.244 --> 19:06.779
(siren wailing)

19:06.813 --> 19:08.281
I've got an adult male, age 65,

19:08.315 --> 19:10.717
with a large piece of shrapnel
in his right thigh.

19:10.750 --> 19:13.119
Femoral artery damage
with profuse bleeding,

19:13.152 --> 19:14.254
ten minutes out.

19:14.287 --> 19:16.723
Buck, I want you to travel
with him to the hospital,

19:16.756 --> 19:18.625
keep him stable.

19:18.658 --> 19:21.394
Copy that, Cap.

19:21.428 --> 19:23.463
Hey. You got to learn
how to play nice.

19:23.496 --> 19:24.631
It's one team, Buck.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.966
Hey, Nash, am I gonna be
all right?

19:26.999 --> 19:28.301
BOBBY:
My boys have got you.

19:28.335 --> 19:30.136
But you might want
to consider switching

19:30.169 --> 19:32.772
to collecting baseball cards
after this.

19:35.242 --> 19:38.345
(siren wailing)

19:38.378 --> 19:40.647
I guess you've seen
a lot of shrapnel wounds.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.014
My share.

19:42.048 --> 19:43.650
You ever seen a guy
with a length of rebar

19:43.683 --> 19:44.884
stuck through his skull?

19:44.917 --> 19:47.153
What are we
measuring here, Buck?

19:47.186 --> 19:48.988
(Charlie groans)

19:49.021 --> 19:52.325
Need to change those dressings.
They're soaking through.

19:52.359 --> 19:54.927
Hang in there, Charlie.
Almost there.

19:54.961 --> 19:57.697
I'm just saying,
working the streets of L.A.

19:57.730 --> 19:59.599
is not exactly stress free.

19:59.632 --> 20:01.401
May not be the same kind
of pressure

20:01.434 --> 20:03.035
you have in a war zone, but...

20:04.371 --> 20:06.005
Oh, come on. Hold on.

20:06.038 --> 20:08.441
I thought you said
this was a practice round.

20:08.475 --> 20:09.942
It is.

20:09.976 --> 20:12.512
Uh, what-what-what's going on?

20:12.545 --> 20:13.846
You see that cap?

20:13.880 --> 20:16.616
Practice rounds have blue caps.

20:16.649 --> 20:18.184
Gold caps are live.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.519
Pull over!

20:19.552 --> 20:21.588
JIM:
Yup. There she is.

20:21.621 --> 20:24.223
BOBBY: He's got a live round
embedded in his thigh.

20:24.257 --> 20:26.025
Uh, I thought this thing
already went off.

20:26.058 --> 20:27.560
The launch grenade
has two components:

20:27.594 --> 20:28.928
gunpowder which makes it travel

20:28.961 --> 20:30.930
and an explosive charge
that makes it go boom.

20:30.963 --> 20:33.032
Okay, so why didn't
this one go boom?

20:33.065 --> 20:34.601
It's fitted
with a proximity fuse.

20:34.634 --> 20:37.370
It's a little smart sensor
that tells the cap it's traveled

20:37.404 --> 20:39.406
a safe enough distance
from the shooter to explode.

20:39.439 --> 20:42.275
From his hand to his leg
probably wasn't far enough.

20:42.309 --> 20:45.378
Well, we can't bring him inside
a hospital full of people,

20:45.412 --> 20:47.046
not with that still
stuck inside him.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.481
We called the military for help.

20:48.515 --> 20:50.417
The military?
Uh, can't you do it?

20:50.450 --> 20:51.718
You're the bomb squad.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.386
You can't diffuse a grenade.
We need to find someone

20:53.420 --> 20:55.388
who knows how
to pull that thing out of him

20:55.422 --> 20:56.456
without setting it off.

20:56.489 --> 20:57.924
They're sending someone up
from Pendleton.

20:57.957 --> 20:59.459
Should be here within the hour.

20:59.492 --> 21:01.628
He doesn't have an hour.

21:01.661 --> 21:02.962
I can do it.

21:02.995 --> 21:05.998
If he doesn't go
to surgery soon, he'll die.

21:06.032 --> 21:07.133
You've done this before?

21:07.166 --> 21:08.568
Well, none of the guys
I served with

21:08.601 --> 21:10.737
were dumb enough to shoot
a live round in themselves,

21:10.770 --> 21:13.740
but I'm familiar
with the ordnance.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.875
I'm in.

21:18.378 --> 21:21.748
You get that thing out of him,
put it in here

21:21.781 --> 21:23.583
and get the hell away from it.

21:23.616 --> 21:24.751
Let us deal with it.

21:24.784 --> 21:26.419
Copy that.

21:26.453 --> 21:28.455
See you inside.

21:28.488 --> 21:31.257
All right, listen, Buck,
you don't have to do this.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.926
You think I'm gonna let
the new guy have all the fun?

21:33.960 --> 21:35.695
Besides, you wanted us to bond.

21:35.728 --> 21:38.230
We might end up real close.

21:43.803 --> 21:45.204
How you feeling there, Charlie?

21:45.237 --> 21:47.474
Like a world-class idiot.

21:47.507 --> 21:50.643
My wife, if she was still alive,
she'd be here now

21:50.677 --> 21:52.278
saying, "I told you so."

21:52.311 --> 21:55.715
Well, maybe she'll be able
to tell me in person

21:55.748 --> 21:57.149
in about a minute.

21:57.183 --> 21:59.218
Well, that conversation's
gonna have to wait.

21:59.251 --> 22:01.654
Nobody's leaving
this life tonight.

22:01.688 --> 22:04.491
Start the drip.

22:06.359 --> 22:08.361
What branch did you say
you were in, Charlie?

22:08.395 --> 22:11.631
I didn't. I always wanted
to be a Marine.

22:11.664 --> 22:16.503
I tried to enlist during 'Nam,
but I was 4F, an enlarged heart.

22:16.536 --> 22:20.807
So instead, I spent the last
40 years teaching seventh grade.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.409
See there, Charlie?

22:22.442 --> 22:25.077
Not all heroes
serve on the battlefield.

22:26.178 --> 22:29.015
That's very kind of you
to say that.

22:30.016 --> 22:31.350
You ready?

22:32.419 --> 22:34.421
Yeah.

22:38.224 --> 22:39.926
He's losing a lot of blood.

22:39.959 --> 22:41.694
Keep pressure on it.

22:41.728 --> 22:43.195
Not-not too much pressure.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.267
-There it is.
-All right, so-so pull it out.

22:48.300 --> 22:51.337
-Come on.
-I got to... be careful.

22:51.370 --> 22:54.240
The sensor measures
the distance traveled

22:54.273 --> 22:58.545
based on how many rotations
the shell made

22:58.578 --> 23:01.448
after the launch.

23:01.481 --> 23:06.285
The key is not to turn the shell
while we pull it out.

23:06.318 --> 23:08.187
Okay, yeah, so don't turn it.

23:08.220 --> 23:10.022
-(straining)
-You got this.

23:10.056 --> 23:13.192
Gonna have to just...

23:13.225 --> 23:16.696
a bit...

23:16.729 --> 23:19.031
(groans)

23:19.065 --> 23:20.600
Get the box.

23:31.010 --> 23:33.145
(relieved breaths)

23:42.254 --> 23:43.590
Let's get the robot in there.

23:52.031 --> 23:54.033
You're badass under pressure,
brother.

23:55.301 --> 23:56.669
Me?

23:56.703 --> 23:58.838
Hell yeah.
You can have my back any day.

23:58.871 --> 24:03.075
Yeah.
Or, you know, you could...

24:03.109 --> 24:04.176
you could have mine.

24:04.210 --> 24:06.813
(laughs)
Deal.

24:06.846 --> 24:08.981
Nice work, fellas. I'm glad
you both made it out of there.

24:09.015 --> 24:10.983
The guy's a professional, Cap.

24:11.017 --> 24:12.985
I was never really worried.

24:20.126 --> 24:23.062
-(sirens wailing)
-Cancel the robot.

24:24.631 --> 24:25.965
You guys hungry?

24:33.806 --> 24:36.308
So, what do you think?

24:36.342 --> 24:38.144
I didn't want to overwhelm them

24:38.177 --> 24:40.379
-with too many choices, so...
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

24:40.412 --> 24:45.484
Um, I think that it's, um,
a little...

24:45.518 --> 24:48.988
overwhelming.

24:49.989 --> 24:51.624
You think it's ridiculous.

24:51.658 --> 24:54.527
No, no, I mean...

24:54.561 --> 24:57.530
(sighs) Chim, I kind of think
the whole thing is ridiculous.

24:57.564 --> 25:00.533
You don't think I have a shot.

25:00.567 --> 25:02.168
The pictures are cool.
I-I just...

25:02.201 --> 25:03.903
I don't have these answers
for you, Chim.

25:03.936 --> 25:05.672
I'm not into beefcake calendars.

25:05.705 --> 25:06.806
I know, I know.

25:06.839 --> 25:08.174
Why is this so important to you?

25:08.207 --> 25:10.309
Because growing up,
I never saw any heroes

25:10.342 --> 25:11.578
who looked like me.

25:11.611 --> 25:13.212
I can understand that.

25:13.245 --> 25:15.815
I mean, not on TV,
not in movies.

25:15.848 --> 25:18.484
We're always the computer geek
who hacks into the system

25:18.517 --> 25:20.687
for the white guy
or the evil Tong drug lord.

25:20.720 --> 25:23.656
Or the guy in the dry cleaners
in a fabric softener commercial.

25:23.690 --> 25:27.026
I mean, you know, when a kid
thinks of a firefighter,

25:27.059 --> 25:28.995
do they think of me?

25:29.028 --> 25:30.496
Do they think of you?

25:30.529 --> 25:36.335
Yeah, but I'm not taking
my shirt off for that calendar.

25:36.368 --> 25:39.672
Yeah.
You know what?

25:39.706 --> 25:42.208
(sighs)
Me, either.

25:43.576 --> 25:44.543
Chim...

25:44.577 --> 25:46.178
No, I don't know
what I was thinking.

25:46.212 --> 25:47.680
I can't compete
with these guys.

25:47.714 --> 25:49.215
Maybe ten years ago.

25:49.248 --> 25:51.250
And that's only because
they'd be 12.

25:59.892 --> 26:01.761
(siren wailing)

26:05.732 --> 26:07.600
Hmm...

26:07.634 --> 26:09.135
You just coming in
from somewhere?

26:09.168 --> 26:10.770
I was just going somewhere.

26:10.803 --> 26:14.774
Look, we can stop by your house
on the way so you can change.

26:14.807 --> 26:16.275
We're gonna get
some Korean barbecue.

26:16.308 --> 26:18.044
-Come on.
-(laughs) No, no.

26:18.077 --> 26:20.412
I just got Thai food.

26:21.814 --> 26:25.718
Hey, I would like to take you
out on a proper date.

26:25.752 --> 26:27.553
Aw, that's sweet.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.321
But you got to give me
fair warning

26:29.355 --> 26:31.457
so I can get all done up
for you.

26:31.490 --> 26:33.893
I've tried that many times,
but you always say

26:33.926 --> 26:35.027
you want to stay in instead.

26:35.061 --> 26:36.996
And we've only been out together
as a couple twice,

26:37.029 --> 26:37.997
on our first two dates.

26:38.030 --> 26:39.966
Well, I like when
it's just the two of us.

26:39.999 --> 26:43.102
-It's romantic.
-It is.

26:46.172 --> 26:48.007
Hey, who you hiding from?

26:48.040 --> 26:51.077
It's been almost four months.

26:51.110 --> 26:52.679
This just...
it feels serious to me.

26:52.712 --> 26:53.946
It feels real.

26:53.980 --> 26:56.749
You know? What?

26:56.783 --> 26:58.584
All right, what-what is it?
What's going on?

26:58.617 --> 27:00.653
I don't like being pressured.

27:00.687 --> 27:02.121
Into going out for dinner?
I'm...

27:02.154 --> 27:05.858
This is not the same
for you and me.

27:05.892 --> 27:07.960
Like it's a black/white thing?
I don't...

27:07.994 --> 27:10.830
-Are you crazy?
-All right.

27:12.899 --> 27:16.703
For you, this is a sign
of you coming back to life

27:16.736 --> 27:18.104
after a tragic loss.

27:18.137 --> 27:19.438
It's a redemption.
For me,

27:19.471 --> 27:21.373
it's more complicated than that.

27:21.407 --> 27:24.310
Okay, how is this
not a redemption for you?

27:24.343 --> 27:26.846
Because it's proof
you can love again,

27:26.879 --> 27:28.280
you can trust again.

27:28.314 --> 27:31.183
No one in my family
has ever gotten divorced.

27:31.217 --> 27:33.552
I am the first failure.

27:36.388 --> 27:40.526
Hey, divorce is not a failure.

27:40.559 --> 27:42.895
What do you know about it?
Are you a woman?

27:42.929 --> 27:45.297
Are you a black woman
who can't keep her man?

27:45.331 --> 27:46.532
The stigma of that.

27:46.565 --> 27:48.667
Now you want me
to go out on the town

27:48.701 --> 27:51.537
like a peacock, showing you off
like nothing ever happened.

27:51.570 --> 27:53.572
How's that gonna make me look?

27:53.605 --> 27:55.474
Like a survivor.

27:55.507 --> 27:57.643
-Like a tramp.
-Come on, Athena, that's crazy.

27:57.676 --> 28:00.512
Nobody's gonna think that,
and even if they do, who cares?

28:00.546 --> 28:03.215
Well, you have the luxury
of not caring.

28:03.249 --> 28:04.917
I'm trying to do right by us.

28:04.951 --> 28:08.487
How long are we supposed to
sneak around like this?

28:08.520 --> 28:11.057
Because I'm not gonna be
satisfied with stolen kisses

28:11.090 --> 28:12.258
and take-out containers.

28:12.291 --> 28:13.860
I don't like
keeping us a secret.

28:13.893 --> 28:15.094
It feels like lying.

28:15.127 --> 28:16.662
You kept your secret
about your past

28:16.695 --> 28:19.298
from everyone else for years.

28:24.737 --> 28:27.840
Yeah, I did because
I was ashamed of myself,

28:27.874 --> 28:29.341
and I still am.

28:29.375 --> 28:30.576
Well, then, you of anyone
should understand

28:30.609 --> 28:32.278
why I want to keep this quiet.

28:32.311 --> 28:34.046
What are you ashamed of?
Are you ashamed of me?

28:34.080 --> 28:36.348
No! But yes.

28:36.382 --> 28:37.950
-Yeah?
-Yes!

28:37.984 --> 28:41.020
I'm ashamed!
I'm ashamed of us.

28:41.053 --> 28:45.758
I'm ashamed of you.
I'm ashamed of being happy.

28:45.792 --> 28:49.395
I told you, it's complicated.
(scoffs)

28:51.563 --> 28:54.266
Well, I'm sorry
it's so complicated.

28:55.734 --> 28:57.636
Please leave.

29:03.242 --> 29:04.543
SHAY:
What up, fam!

29:04.576 --> 29:06.245
We got this savage young man

29:06.278 --> 29:10.649
who is about to join the ranks
of Shay's Army of Mayhem.

29:10.682 --> 29:13.986
Jessie has agreed to let us
cement his head

29:14.020 --> 29:16.422
inside this microwave oven!

29:16.455 --> 29:18.791
So random, so awesome!

29:18.825 --> 29:21.928
We have the concrete.
(coughing)

29:23.595 --> 29:26.398
-I need eye protection.
-Copy.

29:26.432 --> 29:28.434
-(mixer whirring)
-(whooping)

29:28.467 --> 29:30.937
* A loaded God complex,
cock it and pull it *

29:30.970 --> 29:34.573
* We're going down, down
in an earlier round *

29:34.606 --> 29:35.674
* And, sugar,
we're going down swinging... *

29:35.707 --> 29:38.344
Breathing tube.
Don't bite it, bro.

29:39.545 --> 29:40.679
No pressure, Jess.

29:40.712 --> 29:43.482
Are you ready to join the ranks
of the legendary?

29:43.515 --> 29:46.018
(muffled):
I don't know.

29:46.052 --> 29:48.855
(laughing, whooping)

29:48.888 --> 29:50.389
Yeah!

29:59.131 --> 30:01.033
(sirens wailing)

30:04.470 --> 30:05.437
Quick. They're in the back.

30:05.471 --> 30:06.772
We put a tube in
so he could breathe.

30:06.805 --> 30:07.974
I think the cement smushed it.

30:08.007 --> 30:10.142
-What is it, a YouTube prank?
-Don't judge.

30:10.176 --> 30:11.677
Followers equals cash.

30:17.683 --> 30:19.018
-BOBBY: What's his name?
-MITCH: Jessie.

30:19.051 --> 30:22.788
Jessie, this is Captain Nash,
LAFD. Can you hear me?

30:22.821 --> 30:24.290
All right, he is totally
cut off in this thing.

30:24.323 --> 30:27.326
Let's get some screwdrivers,
try to get this frame off.

30:29.095 --> 30:32.131
(screwdriver whirring)

30:32.164 --> 30:35.868
-What do you got, Hen?
-Pulse 120, BP 150/110.

30:35.902 --> 30:37.236
-He's panicking.
-All right,
he's starting to choke.

30:37.269 --> 30:39.705
HEN: Saliva's probably aspirated
through the breathing tube.

30:39.738 --> 30:41.140
-Hold on one second.
-Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

30:41.173 --> 30:42.641
-Relax.
-Calm down.
-Okay, calm down.

30:42.674 --> 30:43.775
-Hey, hey!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!

30:57.689 --> 30:58.991
Let's go, let's go.

30:59.025 --> 30:59.992
Come on.

31:00.026 --> 31:02.628
All right, step.

31:05.031 --> 31:07.466
Easy.

31:08.367 --> 31:09.535
All right, watch his neck.

31:11.737 --> 31:13.672
-His pulse is weak.
-I have no respiration.

31:13.705 --> 31:15.074
Is there a plastic bag
in there or something?

31:15.107 --> 31:17.509
Yeah, we put it on his head
before we poured the concrete.

31:17.543 --> 31:18.577
Please don't let him die.

31:18.610 --> 31:19.845
He's my best friend
since kindergarten.

31:19.878 --> 31:21.213
-I can't get in there.
-BOBBY: Yeah, we had

31:21.247 --> 31:22.214
30 minutes
to get him out of there.

31:22.248 --> 31:23.615
Now we got 30 seconds.

31:23.649 --> 31:25.784
No response to sternal rub.

31:25.817 --> 31:27.219
Pulse is fading.
Still no respiration.

31:27.253 --> 31:29.555
BOBBY: All right, Buck,
once we get this frame off,

31:29.588 --> 31:31.457
you and I are gonna go
hammer and chisel on that block.

31:31.490 --> 31:33.425
-All right.
-Starting compressions.

31:36.128 --> 31:37.129
All right, got it.

31:37.163 --> 31:38.897
All right, Buck,

31:38.931 --> 31:41.200
I'm hammer, you're chisel.
Let's go.

31:41.233 --> 31:42.534
I can do this.

31:42.568 --> 31:44.770
All right.

31:49.241 --> 31:50.476
(grunts)

31:52.478 --> 31:53.879
Again.

31:53.912 --> 31:55.747
-(cement cracking)
-All right.

32:05.591 --> 32:08.294
-(coughing)
-HEN: Good job.

32:08.327 --> 32:10.396
(exhales sharply)

32:10.429 --> 32:12.564
-(coughing)
-All right...

32:12.598 --> 32:14.433
Hold still, hold still.

32:14.466 --> 32:15.601
Shay Reed here, fans.

32:15.634 --> 32:17.103
And today's Shay-nanigan
is maybe

32:17.136 --> 32:18.737
our most intense yet!

32:18.770 --> 32:20.239
Are you filming this?

32:20.272 --> 32:22.641
Yeah, bro. If we didn't film it,
it didn't happen.

32:22.674 --> 32:24.576
You were just crying
like two minutes ago.

32:24.610 --> 32:26.145
Yeah, two minutes ago,
he was gonna die.

32:26.178 --> 32:28.747
Now he's gonna live
and be a legend.

32:28.780 --> 32:30.416
Say hello, Shay's Army.

32:30.449 --> 32:31.750
Hello, Shay's army.

32:31.783 --> 32:33.919
Wait, what the... what the
hell, man? What are you do...

32:33.952 --> 32:35.554
-Good-bye, Shay Army!
-SHAY: Dude!

32:45.397 --> 32:47.599
Ah-ha-ha, I found it.

32:47.633 --> 32:50.869
I swear, we need to put
GPS trackers

32:50.902 --> 32:53.005
on everything that boy owns.

32:53.039 --> 32:57.443
Oh, you made waffles...
for dinner?

32:57.476 --> 32:58.577
What's wrong?

32:59.711 --> 33:02.281
I-I don't know
what the rules are here.

33:02.314 --> 33:05.951
Like, if this is something
we can discuss with each other.

33:05.984 --> 33:08.954
Listen, whatever you have
to say to me

33:08.987 --> 33:11.823
can't be as intense
as what I said to you.

33:11.857 --> 33:12.858
Right?

33:15.927 --> 33:18.530
I've been seeing someone
for the last few months.

33:18.564 --> 33:20.166
Oh.

33:20.199 --> 33:21.467
A firefighter.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.335
-Uh-huh.
-No one else knows.

33:23.369 --> 33:24.836
Not even Henrietta.

33:24.870 --> 33:26.572
We've been keeping it
on the down-low

33:26.605 --> 33:28.507
because we didn't know
what it was

33:28.540 --> 33:30.142
or how long it was gonna last.

33:30.176 --> 33:33.179
But now he wants
to tell the world.

33:33.212 --> 33:34.513
And you don't?

33:34.546 --> 33:36.182
No.

33:36.215 --> 33:37.483
Okay.

33:37.516 --> 33:39.017
But he started to push,

33:39.051 --> 33:41.653
and I felt pressure,
so I pushed back hard.

33:41.687 --> 33:44.390
Ooh. Ouch.

33:44.423 --> 33:47.259
What? I've been on the receiving
end of your hard pushes.

33:49.228 --> 33:51.163
And you care about him.

33:51.197 --> 33:52.998
I can tell.

33:53.031 --> 33:54.933
(laughs)

33:54.966 --> 33:57.503
So where's the harm
in telling everybody?

33:57.536 --> 33:59.671
I don't want to be embarrassed.

33:59.705 --> 34:02.441
I mean, our divorce
was enough of a failure.

34:02.474 --> 34:04.176
I can't go through that again.

34:04.210 --> 34:07.045
Oh, I get it. Okay.

34:07.079 --> 34:09.781
You don't want to invest 'cause
you're afraid of being hurt.

34:10.982 --> 34:12.851
Which you might.

34:12.884 --> 34:16.722
But what is
the other alternative?

34:18.657 --> 34:20.392
Being alone?

34:20.426 --> 34:23.229
Hmm. Maybe. It's safer.

34:25.397 --> 34:27.866
You know, fear

34:27.899 --> 34:32.271
trapped me
in a closet my whole life.

34:32.304 --> 34:36.308
Embarrassment kept me
from admitting the truth to you

34:36.342 --> 34:38.610
every day of our marriage.

34:38.644 --> 34:40.379
It was eating me up inside.

34:40.412 --> 34:44.583
Until I stopped trying
to control it, and stepped out.

34:44.616 --> 34:46.252
Had faith and let it happen.

34:46.285 --> 34:50.456
It was hard and sad,
but, baby, look at us now.

34:50.489 --> 34:52.791
Hmm?

34:52.824 --> 34:56.061
Our divorce wasn't
a failure, Athena.

34:56.094 --> 34:58.930
We're still family, baby.

35:01.300 --> 35:03.135
And listen, if this thing
doesn't work out

35:03.169 --> 35:06.205
with this firefighter,
you'll move on.

35:07.639 --> 35:10.742
In the meantime,
if he makes you happy,

35:10.776 --> 35:12.244
then why not be happy?

35:12.278 --> 35:14.180
You deserve it.

35:17.216 --> 35:19.651
(chiming,
miniature siren wailing)

35:19.685 --> 35:21.753
BUCK:
Okay, what about "G.I.?"

35:21.787 --> 35:23.622
Like G.I. Joe. "Hey, G.I."

35:23.655 --> 35:25.090
You know,
that's a great nickname.

35:25.123 --> 35:26.992
Sounds like gastrointestinal.

35:27.025 --> 35:29.295
Yeah, I don't think so.

35:29.328 --> 35:30.796
BOBBY:
All right, everybody, listen up.

35:30.829 --> 35:32.164
I've got an announcement
to make.

35:32.198 --> 35:34.433
I just got off the phone with
the people from the calendar,

35:34.466 --> 35:36.101
and they have made their choice.

35:36.134 --> 35:39.305
Well, no hard feelings,
no matter who won.

35:39.338 --> 35:41.807
That's good, Buck,
'cause they didn't pick you.

35:41.840 --> 35:43.108
Well, it's obviously a fix.

35:43.141 --> 35:45.477
No, congratulations anyway,
G.I.!

35:45.511 --> 35:46.812
(chuckles)

35:46.845 --> 35:48.380
They didn't pick him, either.

35:48.414 --> 35:50.616
No? You?

35:50.649 --> 35:52.818
-No.
-(celery crunching)

35:55.254 --> 35:57.289
No way.
You got to be kidding me.

35:57.323 --> 36:00.058
No. Congratulations, Chim.

36:00.091 --> 36:02.228
Or should I say Mr. April?

36:02.261 --> 36:04.296
-No way. Are you serious?
-BUCK: Chimney!

36:04.330 --> 36:05.731
-You're a calendar boy, now.
-You serious?

36:05.764 --> 36:07.399
Mr. April, buddy.

36:07.433 --> 36:10.702
-30 days of Chimney.
-Congratulations.

36:10.736 --> 36:13.472
-You did it.
-Thank you.

36:13.505 --> 36:16.342
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

36:19.578 --> 36:23.014
Hey. I'm sorry.

36:25.584 --> 36:26.852
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

36:32.424 --> 36:34.360
All right.

36:38.029 --> 36:39.931
What are you all looking at?

36:39.965 --> 36:41.700
There's no more announcements.

36:41.733 --> 36:44.236
-Pay up.
-(all groaning)

36:44.270 --> 36:46.238
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
you knew?

36:46.272 --> 36:50.909
Sir, first you two were
happy at the same time,

36:50.942 --> 36:52.611
then you were both pissed off
at the same time.

36:52.644 --> 36:55.213
-It wasn't hard to figure out.
-And, uh, you good with this?

36:55.247 --> 36:57.949
Girl, I'm just mad at myself

36:57.983 --> 36:59.851
for not fixing you up
in the first place.

36:59.885 --> 37:03.355
(both laugh)

37:03.389 --> 37:04.590
Staying for dinner?

37:04.623 --> 37:06.091
I don't know. Are you cooking?

37:06.124 --> 37:08.059
Yeah.

37:13.899 --> 37:16.034
-Thank you.
-CHIMNEY: Hen.

37:16.067 --> 37:19.705
So, uh, you want to tell me
how you managed this?

37:19.738 --> 37:23.208
(scoffs) I think they've been
seeing each other for months.

37:23.241 --> 37:26.077
Hen, you know
what I'm talking about.

37:26.111 --> 37:28.914
I never submitted myself
for that calendar.

37:30.749 --> 37:32.250
But I deleted
all those pictures.

37:32.284 --> 37:34.085
How'd you get a hold of them?

37:35.321 --> 37:39.057
I didn't use
any of those pictures.

37:39.090 --> 37:42.394
Last year, the school bus
accident on the 710,

37:42.428 --> 37:45.997
an AP photographer
got a photo of you

37:46.031 --> 37:49.435
carrying a little girl
across the freeway.

37:49.468 --> 37:50.802
That's what I sent in.

37:50.836 --> 37:52.237
Not some picture of you

37:52.270 --> 37:54.239
pretending to be
a big damn hero,

37:54.272 --> 37:58.009
but an actual picture
of you being a damn hero.

37:58.043 --> 38:00.746
Because that's
what you are, Chim.

38:00.779 --> 38:03.782
And that's what
a hero looks like.

38:03.815 --> 38:05.951
You.

38:14.626 --> 38:17.796
-Mr. April. Yes!
-(claps)

38:21.700 --> 38:22.934
(knuckles cracking)

38:22.968 --> 38:25.437
(phone vibrating)

38:25.471 --> 38:27.005
Laurie?

38:27.038 --> 38:28.874
DOUG (over phone):
No. It's not your boss.

38:28.907 --> 38:30.308
I'm in her office.

38:30.342 --> 38:32.844
And evidently,
she's not your boss anymore

38:32.878 --> 38:34.813
because you quit.

38:35.847 --> 38:38.083
Where are you, Maddie?

38:39.150 --> 38:41.286
It doesn't matter.

38:41.319 --> 38:42.788
It doesn't matter
'cause we're done.

38:42.821 --> 38:46.124
You don't get to decide
when we're done. I decide!

38:46.157 --> 38:48.093
Tell me where you are!

38:49.428 --> 38:52.698
Then I guess I'm gonna
have to come find you.

38:52.731 --> 38:57.369
And you'd better hope that
when I do, I'm in a better mood.

38:57.403 --> 38:58.937
(grunts)

39:04.576 --> 39:08.514
(door opens, closes)

39:08.547 --> 39:10.181
(keys jingle)

39:16.555 --> 39:18.690
Leaving already?

39:18.724 --> 39:20.692
Road ahead awaits.

39:20.726 --> 39:24.229
I'm more concerned
with the road behind you.

39:26.465 --> 39:28.033
Maddie, what really
happened with Doug?

39:28.066 --> 39:30.101
Why are you running away
from him?

39:30.135 --> 39:34.172
No. I'm not gonna bring
my little brother into this.

39:34.205 --> 39:35.507
Standing in between you

39:35.541 --> 39:37.242
and anyone who thinks
they can hurt you

39:37.275 --> 39:39.545
is exactly where
I want to be standing.

39:50.121 --> 39:53.258
Maddie, are you
in some kind of danger?

39:57.929 --> 40:01.032
The stuff that Mom and Dad
hated about him,

40:01.066 --> 40:05.571
that you picked up on
even as a teenager,

40:05.604 --> 40:07.906
it all got worse.

40:09.608 --> 40:11.877
Much worse
over the last year or so.

40:11.910 --> 40:16.948
And when I threatened to leave,
he threatened to kill me.

40:18.950 --> 40:21.419
(voice breaking):
And he meant it.

40:25.123 --> 40:28.159
You know, when women
in abusive relationships

40:28.193 --> 40:30.596
used to come into the hospital,
I got to be honest,

40:30.629 --> 40:31.897
I would pass judgment.

40:31.930 --> 40:34.633
Like, "Why don't you
just leave him?"

40:34.666 --> 40:36.434
Now I get it.

40:36.468 --> 40:40.105
It's like, you can't even
believe it's happening.

40:41.807 --> 40:43.441
But you broke free.

40:45.310 --> 40:48.547
And I'm proud of you.

40:50.048 --> 40:52.584
But now is not the time
to be alone, all right?

40:52.618 --> 40:55.153
So-so-so you...
you should stay here.

40:55.186 --> 40:57.088
All right? I-I got...
I got plenty of room,

40:57.122 --> 41:00.425
and-and, hey,
if Doug comes looking, then...

41:00.458 --> 41:02.761
-I know a lot of cops.
-He won't.

41:02.794 --> 41:04.763
He doesn't know you live here.
He doesn't know what you do.

41:04.796 --> 41:07.766
It's a real benefit
to being married to somebody

41:07.799 --> 41:10.201
who doesn't ask any questions.

41:11.336 --> 41:13.138
Okay, well, that's perfect.

41:13.171 --> 41:16.808
You can start over.

41:16.842 --> 41:19.110
I can help you. I can help you
get a great nursing job

41:19.144 --> 41:20.612
at one of the hospitals.

41:20.646 --> 41:22.781
No.

41:22.814 --> 41:25.483
I really miss helping people,

41:25.517 --> 41:28.787
but I can't do that job
every day,

41:28.820 --> 41:30.155
looking over my shoulder,

41:30.188 --> 41:33.825
wondering who's walking
in the front door.

41:33.859 --> 41:38.129
Okay. So you want to help people

41:38.163 --> 41:40.899
but not deal with them
face-to-face.

41:40.932 --> 41:43.401
Yeah.

41:43.434 --> 41:46.504
I think I might have an idea.

41:46.538 --> 41:49.507
MADDIE:
We all feel pressure,

41:49.541 --> 41:51.710
but it's how we respond
that matters.

41:51.743 --> 41:57.082
Being a 911 dispatcher will be
challenging and exhausting

41:57.115 --> 42:00.085
and can take an emotional toll.

42:00.118 --> 42:02.487
The people who call in
are scared,

42:02.520 --> 42:06.091
in need,
and we are their lifeline.

42:06.124 --> 42:08.493
But it can also be rewarding.

42:08.526 --> 42:12.831
Calling us is probably the
scariest moment of their lives.

42:12.864 --> 42:16.067
But if we do our jobs right
and help arrives in time

42:16.101 --> 42:18.169
and we get a little lucky,

42:18.203 --> 42:21.607
then maybe it doesn't have to be
the worst moment of their lives.

42:23.909 --> 42:25.844
Sounds like a lot of pressure.

42:25.877 --> 42:28.513
I don't know
if I'm up for that. You?

42:28.546 --> 42:30.448
MADDIE: Pressure doesn't have
to break us down.

42:30.481 --> 42:32.784
It can show us who we
really are. And that's good.

42:32.818 --> 42:34.219
911 OPERATOR:
You're gonna be fine.

42:34.252 --> 42:35.520
When did the pain start?

42:35.553 --> 42:37.022
911. What is your emergency?

42:37.055 --> 42:39.390
MADDIE: Because in the end,
it's always there.

42:39.424 --> 42:41.727
-Help is on the way.
-MADDIE: The pressure.

42:41.760 --> 42:44.763
And eventually,
it has to be released.

42:45.964 --> 42:48.199
* Rock steady, baby

42:48.233 --> 42:50.268
* That's what I feel now *

42:50.301 --> 42:53.639
* Just call the song
exactly what it is *

42:53.672 --> 42:55.641

42:55.674 --> 42:57.876
-(tires screeching)
-* Just move your hips
with a feeling *

42:57.909 --> 42:59.477
* From side to side

42:59.510 --> 43:01.647
* Sit yourself down
in your car *

43:01.680 --> 43:03.248
* And take a ride

43:03.281 --> 43:06.151
* While you're moving,
rock steady *

43:06.184 --> 43:08.887
* Rock steady, baby

43:08.920 --> 43:11.757
* Let's call this song
exactly what it is *

43:11.790 --> 43:13.491
* What it is, what it is,
what it is *

43:13.524 --> 43:14.726
* It's a funky
and lowdown feeling... *

43:14.760 --> 43:16.327
(horns honking,
car alarms blaring)

43:16.361 --> 43:18.163
* In the hips
from left to right... *

43:18.196 --> 43:19.397
