00:55.250 --> 00:58.750
<i>Christmas, huh,
the chicken wing of holidays.</i>

00:59.125 --> 01:00.416
<i>Yeah, I said it.</i>

01:00.416 --> 01:02.916
<i>A lot of work and definitely overrated.</i>

01:02.916 --> 01:06.208
<i>Don't get me wrong, I like a day off
just like the next guy.</i>

01:06.541 --> 01:09.333
<i>But give me Juneteenth
or the Fourth of July.</i>

01:09.333 --> 01:11.458
<i>Heck, I even get down
with Arbor Day.</i>

01:11.458 --> 01:15.291
<i>At least then you plant a tree
instead of chopping one down.</i>

01:15.291 --> 01:19.250
<i>And before you go calling me a hater,
you gotta know I have another big reason</i>

01:19.250 --> 01:20.916
<i>for not messing with Christmas.</i>

01:20.916 --> 01:23.458
<i>On this day,
everybody's expecting many gifts</i>

01:23.458 --> 01:25.583
<i>but not me, all I needed was one thing.</i>

01:25.583 --> 01:28.083
<i>So, I went all the way to the top,
to the one guy</i>

01:28.083 --> 01:30.375
<i>that I knew could help
with this one request.</i>

01:30.375 --> 01:31.708
Oh!

01:31.708 --> 01:34.041
What do you want for Christmas, pally?

01:34.041 --> 01:36.416
I already sent you a letter
to the North Pole.

01:36.416 --> 01:39.916
I'm a little behind on my letter-reading,
so, what'll it be?

01:39.916 --> 01:42.708
I want my parents to not fight.
Can you do that, Santa?

01:43.375 --> 01:44.833
I don't know. Maybe.

01:44.833 --> 01:47.291
My dad wants a collapsible fishing rod.

01:47.291 --> 01:49.125
He loves to fish.

01:49.125 --> 01:52.583
So, if you could bring him the rod
and he thinks it's from my mom,

01:52.583 --> 01:55.291
well, that'll solve everything.

01:55.291 --> 01:56.416
Is that your mom?

01:56.416 --> 01:57.958
Yeah, that's her.

01:58.916 --> 02:02.125
She look a little sad because
my dad's been gone for a few days.

02:02.125 --> 02:04.625
So, Santa, can you do that?

02:05.166 --> 02:06.708
Where do you live?

02:07.666 --> 02:10.833
<i>I thought it was a little weird
that Santa asked where I lived,</i>

02:10.833 --> 02:14.041
<i>but look, the guy has so much
to worry about on Christmas.</i>

02:14.916 --> 02:17.416
T<i>hings were going exactly
the way I wanted them to.</i>

02:17.416 --> 02:19.375
<i>My dad had come off his business trip</i>

02:19.375 --> 02:21.500
<i>and made it home
just in time for Christmas.</i>

02:21.500 --> 02:22.958
What's all this?

02:22.958 --> 02:26.875
Eddie asked if we could have
a proper Christmas.

02:26.875 --> 02:28.208
It's beautiful.

02:28.208 --> 02:31.083
<i>My family was finally together
for Christmas.</i>

02:31.083 --> 02:32.500
First time in forever.

02:32.500 --> 02:36.208
Yeah, it's been a long time.

02:37.625 --> 02:40.083
So we can make it all nice for Santa.

02:40.083 --> 02:41.166
Right, Dad?

02:44.083 --> 02:47.375
Yeah, because we wanna make it
nice for Santa, son.

02:47.375 --> 02:50.125
<i>Little old me had high hopes
for that night.</i>

02:50.125 --> 02:53.916
<i>I mean, if you can't count on Santa Claus,
who can you really count on?</i>

02:57.291 --> 02:59.333
<i>So, I bet on old Saint Nick.</i>

03:02.166 --> 03:04.833
<i>And for a moment,
I thought I rolled sevens.</i>

03:04.833 --> 03:06.875
Hey, you stealing our stuff?

03:06.875 --> 03:09.041
<i>But instead, I crapped out.</i>

03:13.250 --> 03:14.291
No, Dad, no!

03:14.291 --> 03:15.375
<i>But nope.</i>

03:15.375 --> 03:16.708
He's come to help!

03:16.708 --> 03:18.166
<i>It wasn't Santa at all.</i>

03:18.166 --> 03:20.625
<i>It was just that mall dude
in a rented suit</i>

03:20.625 --> 03:22.541
<i>there to take instead of give.</i>

03:22.541 --> 03:25.541
<i>While my pops was deckin' Santa's halls.</i>

03:25.541 --> 03:29.166
<i>Because of him,
that was the last Christmas</i>

03:29.166 --> 03:31.125
<i>we ever spent together as a family.</i>

03:31.125 --> 03:32.208
Stop!

03:32.208 --> 03:34.958
<i>That's when I learned
not to count on Christmas.</i>

03:34.958 --> 03:37.125
O<i>h, yeah, and by the way,
if he ever asks,</i>

03:37.125 --> 03:39.083
<i>don't give Santa your home address.</i>

03:44.500 --> 03:47.625

04:06.333 --> 04:09.958

04:16.083 --> 04:19.000
Well, hello, Baby Girl,
how are you today?

04:19.000 --> 04:21.916
So good, because it's Christmas Eve.

04:21.916 --> 04:23.000
Oh, yeah, that.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.416
It's so dumb how you don't like Christmas.

04:25.416 --> 04:27.625
Now, come on,
you know I like it just fine.

04:27.625 --> 04:30.416
I just don't like the music,
decorations, ornaments,

04:30.416 --> 04:32.541
the lights or the trees or the cookies,

04:32.541 --> 04:34.166
and the excessive shopping.

04:34.166 --> 04:36.583
You're a dodo.
Are you gonna come by later?

04:36.583 --> 04:38.500
Of course I'm gonna come by later.

04:38.500 --> 04:40.083
- I wouldn't miss it for the world.

04:40.083 --> 04:41.958
Hey, Baby Girl, I got another call.

04:41.958 --> 04:43.541
Okay, then I'll see you later.

04:44.208 --> 04:46.000
- <i>Bye, Grumpus.</i>
- Bye.

04:47.333 --> 04:50.083
- Moke, what up?
- <i>Hey, Merry Christmas from Atlanta PD.</i>

04:50.083 --> 04:52.166
<i>We need our favorite crisis counselor.</i>

04:52.166 --> 04:55.750
<i>- Can you get down to the arts center now?</i>
- Yep, I got you. I'm on the way.

05:13.833 --> 05:15.791
Moke, talk to me, what's going on?

05:15.791 --> 05:16.875
Check it out.

05:18.541 --> 05:20.833
Do I even wanna know
what he's doing up there?

05:21.500 --> 05:23.166
- Did you get a name?
- Nope.

05:23.166 --> 05:24.625
You can take the ladder up.

05:27.416 --> 05:28.625
Nah, I got this.

05:28.625 --> 05:31.125
I'll tell you when
to send it up for us, alright?

05:43.916 --> 05:45.916
Hey, good day to you.

05:45.916 --> 05:47.416
That's a nice beard, man.

05:47.416 --> 05:49.208
I've been trying to grow mine out

05:49.208 --> 05:51.333
and it just doesn't work
for some reason.

05:51.458 --> 05:54.708
- How you doing? You got a name?
- I'm Luther.

05:55.125 --> 05:57.916
Luther, I'm Eddie.
And it's a pleasure to meet you.

05:57.916 --> 06:01.375
- You police, Eddie?
- No, no, no, I'm a clinician.

06:02.541 --> 06:05.083
Social worker. I work with the police.

06:05.083 --> 06:07.416
I help people that might be
in some trouble

06:07.416 --> 06:09.916
but not the police-needing
kind of trouble.

06:09.916 --> 06:12.708
So tell me, Luther,
what are you doing up here?

06:12.708 --> 06:14.791
I just wanna be up here on my own.

06:14.791 --> 06:17.833
Okay, I get that,
but let me tell you something, Luther.

06:17.833 --> 06:21.875
My job, okay,
the most important part of my job

06:21.875 --> 06:24.375
is to never let someone
who feels sad and alone

06:24.375 --> 06:26.416
keep on feeling sad and alone.

06:27.125 --> 06:29.666
Yeah, well, I do feel
sad and alone today.

06:31.083 --> 06:32.791
Yeah, Christmas can be tough.

06:34.125 --> 06:35.125
That's right.

06:35.125 --> 06:37.500
Did you have good Christmases growing up?

06:38.291 --> 06:39.958
They were... they were the best.

06:39.958 --> 06:42.083
- Did your mom do the cooking?
- Yeah.

06:42.083 --> 06:44.916
My mom made the biggest darn roast
that you ever seen.

06:44.916 --> 06:46.541
Yeah, mine did too, man.

06:46.541 --> 06:49.041
- Did the meat fall off the bone?
- Straight off.

06:49.041 --> 06:51.291
- What about the baby carrots.
- And molasses.

06:51.291 --> 06:53.125
- Of course, yeah.

06:53.125 --> 06:56.291
- And red potatoes.
- Red potatoes, I love red potatoes.

06:56.291 --> 06:57.875
- Skin on or skin off?
- Skin on.

06:57.875 --> 07:00.666
What do you take me as,
a savage, Luther? Come on, man.

07:00.666 --> 07:02.916
You got a sense of humor, my man.

07:03.375 --> 07:05.250
What do you say we head on down, huh?

07:05.250 --> 07:07.625
I'll get you a bed
at Moonlight Mission, okay?

07:07.625 --> 07:09.958
Maybe Christmas
doesn't have to be so tricky.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.041
You believe that?

07:12.708 --> 07:15.875
I believe in baby carrots
and red potatoes.

07:16.583 --> 07:18.000
With the skin on.

07:26.791 --> 07:28.583
Hey, everybody, this is Luther.

07:28.583 --> 07:31.333
He's thinking about
heading to the Moonlight Mission.

07:31.333 --> 07:33.625
Let's send Doc Frawley by
to take a look at him.

07:33.625 --> 07:37.041
Call our girl Naomi over there
at Finnegan's Chop House too,

07:37.041 --> 07:40.583
tell them we'll need a few slices
of their finest roast.

07:40.583 --> 07:42.208
With all the fixings, right?

07:43.916 --> 07:45.125
My man.

07:48.208 --> 07:50.583
I'll be by tomorrow to check on him, okay?

07:50.583 --> 07:51.833
- Okay.
- Alright.

07:51.833 --> 07:53.958
You have a very Merry Christmas, Eddie.

07:53.958 --> 07:56.500
I don't know what that is
but it sounds awful.

Hey, Luther, my man.

08:29.708 --> 08:31.875
Go on, get you that roast.

08:31.875 --> 08:36.875
A Christmas tree is like a pair
of warm open hands

08:37.416 --> 08:41.125
welcoming all to the season
of love and sharing.

08:41.666 --> 08:45.000
For me, the true wonder
of Christmas Eve

08:45.000 --> 08:49.208
is how it makes each of us,
no matter our age

08:49.916 --> 08:51.916
feel like little children.

08:51.916 --> 08:54.666
We are all one big family of man

08:54.666 --> 08:56.958
and the very best gift we can give

08:57.458 --> 09:00.208
is to help those who have the least.

09:02.041 --> 09:03.333
I mean that.

<i>Always remember to be there

09:18.333 --> 09:19.625
Hey...

09:19.625 --> 09:21.916
Hi. You look so shocked.

09:21.916 --> 09:24.958
What do you see, ghosts
from your past, present and future?

09:27.166 --> 09:29.750
Very funny. Hey, Baby Girl.

09:29.750 --> 09:33.250
Hi, Dad! We brought you Christmas dinner.

09:33.250 --> 09:36.875
Wow. You are dressed up
in red and green.

09:36.875 --> 09:38.958
In case you bring me
somewhere special.

09:38.958 --> 09:40.291
I have to look the part.

09:40.291 --> 09:42.458
Take this for me. Thank you.

09:42.458 --> 09:44.291
Hold it up. Okay.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
What's this about?

09:47.000 --> 09:49.916
This is about me having
a high degree of confidence

09:49.916 --> 09:52.041
that you were not gonna come by tonight.

09:52.041 --> 09:55.083
I didn't want you
to disappoint our child on Christmas Eve.

09:55.083 --> 09:58.250
Okay, so let me ask you,
what's the point of us doing therapy

09:58.250 --> 10:01.708
if you're not gonna let me
try and prove to you that it's working.

10:01.708 --> 10:04.791
Oh, Eddie, I was just giving you
a head start.

10:04.791 --> 10:07.125
The ham is the kind you like.

10:07.125 --> 10:11.750
- With the pineapple loops in it?
- And that brown sugar glaze.

10:12.416 --> 10:14.500
You know what? Forget about the therapy.

10:14.500 --> 10:16.750
Why don't we just go dancing tonight?

10:16.750 --> 10:18.125
Hmm.

10:19.250 --> 10:22.000
As tempting as that sounds, hmm, no.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.958
I have some last-minute shopping to do,
but please have my child home by 8:30.

10:25.958 --> 10:27.708
Wait, wait. You're leaving?

10:27.708 --> 10:32.166
Uh, yeah. I mean, it's the first time
in what, almost a decade

10:32.166 --> 10:35.125
that Daddy is not working on Christmas.

10:35.833 --> 10:38.666
Sounds like some
daddy-daughter fun time to me.

10:39.208 --> 10:41.916
- Daddy-daughter fun time?
- Your child loves Christmas.

10:41.916 --> 10:43.333
- Yeah?
- I know, I know...

10:43.333 --> 10:44.791
- Just have fun.
- I got it.

10:44.791 --> 10:46.083
- You know me.
- Okay.

10:46.083 --> 10:48.125
- I'm Mr. Fun.
- Alright.

10:48.125 --> 10:50.000
Bye, baby, I'll see you later!

10:50.000 --> 10:51.791
- Bye, Mom!
-  Have a good time.

10:51.791 --> 10:55.416
Put that food in the fridge,
your daddy'll leave it out on the counter.

10:55.416 --> 10:56.500
Oh, hold up.

10:58.000 --> 11:02.125
I still don't understand why
we have to wear these dopey things.

11:02.125 --> 11:03.875
It's called blending in.

11:03.875 --> 11:06.833
It's Christmas Eve,
which is the genius of the plan

11:06.833 --> 11:08.625
and also its inherent flaw.

11:08.625 --> 11:10.875
You can't just show up
at people's homes.

11:10.875 --> 11:13.416
This way, you look like
a bunch of happy carolers,

11:13.416 --> 11:15.458
but you're actually
collecting money for me.

11:15.458 --> 11:17.583
Yeah, call it Christmas camouflage.

11:17.583 --> 11:20.000
- That's a good one.
-  No, no, it's...

11:20.000 --> 11:21.750
I was just about to say that, so...

11:22.833 --> 11:23.875
Thank you.

11:25.583 --> 11:28.541
Here's a list of the people
you'll be collecting money from.

11:28.541 --> 11:30.375
Protect that iPad with your lives.

11:30.375 --> 11:32.833
Think of it as a bribery menu.

11:37.041 --> 11:38.416
Hey, so...

11:39.250 --> 11:42.291
Does your mother have any new friends
I should know about?

11:42.291 --> 11:44.375
- Really?
- You know, the type of friends

11:44.375 --> 11:46.291
that might take her for meals

11:46.291 --> 11:49.083
and put their arms around her
while watching <i>Black-ish.</i>

11:49.750 --> 11:51.333
Oh, you mean like Roger?

11:52.250 --> 11:54.791
- Um, do you have a green...
- No, no, no.

11:54.791 --> 11:56.666
Did you say Roger? Who's Roger?

11:56.666 --> 11:58.708
He wears a fur coat
and has tiny eyes,

11:58.708 --> 12:00.708
but still looks like Bruno Mars.

12:01.541 --> 12:03.875
Yeah, well, Roger sounds like a real jerk.

12:04.666 --> 12:06.875
Roger's my hamster, Dad.

12:09.083 --> 12:11.416
You messing with me of all people?

12:13.708 --> 12:16.250
You doing the dishes tonight,
you know that, right?

12:19.416 --> 12:22.500
<i>♪ Oh Christmas tree, Oh Christmas tree ♪</i>

12:22.958 --> 12:24.833
Dad, come look at this!

12:26.458 --> 12:28.333
Isn't that nice?

12:29.083 --> 12:31.708
They sound like a bunch of wounded ducks.

12:31.708 --> 12:34.458
Baby, I gotta go next door
and feed the Mannings' cat.

12:34.458 --> 12:35.666
They're in Cancun.

12:35.666 --> 12:39.166
- You wanna come?
- I would but Gabriel and Taniya

12:39.166 --> 12:41.041
are doing a routine.

12:41.041 --> 12:42.875
Okay, well, I'll be right back.

12:42.875 --> 12:45.291
- Don't go anywhere.
- Be nice to Pudding Foots.

12:45.291 --> 12:47.291
Or she won't come out of her hiding place.

12:47.291 --> 12:49.500
Her name's Pudding Foots,
I'm a grown man,

12:49.500 --> 12:52.208
- I'mma call her cat.
-  That's a cute name!

12:52.583 --> 12:55.041
I can't believe
you let him steal the iPad.

12:55.041 --> 12:56.708
Are we sure it's even in there?

12:56.708 --> 12:59.458
Of course it's in there.
We tracked it here.

12:59.458 --> 13:02.500
- Alright, let's go in there and get it.
- Wait, who is that?

13:02.500 --> 13:04.500
I dunno, kinda looks like John Legend.

13:12.833 --> 13:14.833
Pudding Foots.

13:14.833 --> 13:16.916
Oh, Pudding Foots.

13:16.916 --> 13:19.500
Here, kitty, kitty.

13:19.500 --> 13:21.208
Cat! Where you at?

13:21.208 --> 13:23.416
If my name was Pudding Foots,
I'd hide too.

13:23.416 --> 13:24.791
Where you at?

13:29.916 --> 13:33.083
I knew I should've started
CrossFit after Thanksgiving.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.833
Mm-hmm, I got those hippo hips.

13:39.833 --> 13:42.916
Got the baboon butt.
Now, look at me, I'm stuck.

13:44.000 --> 13:48.041
Excuse me, do you mind telling me what
you're doing in my neighbor's chimney?

13:48.041 --> 13:50.333
- Can you see me?
- Yeah, I can see you.

13:51.458 --> 13:53.583
What am I doing here, uh...

13:53.875 --> 13:56.125
I'm just... I'm just hanging out, you know?

13:56.125 --> 13:58.500
Doing an impersonation of a bat.

13:58.500 --> 14:01.166
If the bat was Prince.
You know, the singer.

14:01.166 --> 14:04.708
- So we call him Prince bat.
- I have no idea what you're talking about.

14:04.708 --> 14:07.958
But you gotta go, you in a lot of trouble
but I'mma get you out.

14:07.958 --> 14:11.750
- That'll be blissful.
- You ready? One, two...

14:11.750 --> 14:14.250
- Three!

14:16.875 --> 14:20.083
Wow,
I was really stuck in there.

14:20.083 --> 14:22.291
It's not because I gained weight,
you know?

14:23.125 --> 14:25.000
Anywho, can we forget all about this?

14:25.000 --> 14:28.083
Can we not tell nobody
about me trapped in the chimney?

14:28.083 --> 14:29.750
Plus, I got a long night ahead.

14:29.750 --> 14:32.166
I got things to do, as you can see.
Excuse me.

14:32.166 --> 14:35.125
Excuse...
Hey, do you hear me talking to you?

14:36.000 --> 14:37.958
Hey, that's not your fridge.

14:37.958 --> 14:39.083
I mean, seriously?

14:39.083 --> 14:42.333
Simple dictums, tainted,
traditional, time-honored customs.

14:42.333 --> 14:43.875
What?

14:43.875 --> 14:45.458
Capers?

14:45.458 --> 14:47.708
So they got capers but no bagels, no lox.

14:47.708 --> 14:50.083
- No green onion shmears?
- What are you doing?

14:50.083 --> 14:52.500
I'm looking for cookies and milk.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.708
And they don't have either.

14:55.458 --> 14:57.625
They don't have neither... either.

14:57.625 --> 15:01.625
I've never been clear on the difference
between neither and either, are you?

15:02.083 --> 15:04.500
Neither matters right now because it seems

15:04.500 --> 15:06.958
as if you've broken
into my neighbor's home.

15:07.500 --> 15:10.000
Now, you seem a little confused.

15:12.125 --> 15:13.166
Are you confused?

15:16.125 --> 15:19.500
- Now, do you mind if I frisk you?
- Whoa, whoa, Hands McGee, okay?

15:20.083 --> 15:22.166
- Are you the police?
- No.

15:22.166 --> 15:23.791
But I work with the police.

15:23.791 --> 15:27.791
If I can be honest with you, you don't
really look like you work for the cops.

15:27.791 --> 15:31.625
You look like you sell copy machines
to people who don't want copy machines.

15:31.625 --> 15:33.333
- Bang.

15:33.333 --> 15:35.541
Official. You see that?

15:35.541 --> 15:38.166
- Atlanta Police.
- I can barely see that.

15:38.166 --> 15:40.333
Thought I left my glasses in the sleigh.

15:40.333 --> 15:42.250
Oh, they're right here.

15:42.250 --> 15:45.791
- In the sleigh?
- Yep, I have a sleigh.

15:47.333 --> 15:48.791
That's not obvious?

15:49.250 --> 15:51.833
- Sleigh?
- Okay, maybe this will jog your memory.

15:52.416 --> 15:56.000
"He sprang to his sleigh,
to his team gave a whistle,

15:57.166 --> 16:00.833
"and away they all flew
like the down of a thistle."

16:00.833 --> 16:03.041
S... Stop! Stop talking.

16:03.583 --> 16:05.708
What are you doing in my neighbor's house?

16:05.708 --> 16:09.250
I am here to drop off gifts
to the Mannings.

16:09.250 --> 16:10.916
You know the Mannings?

16:10.916 --> 16:13.875
Of course, they're on vacation
right now in Cancun, right?

16:13.875 --> 16:16.791
They're about to come back
with these embarrassing cornrows

16:16.791 --> 16:18.875
which is really weird to see,
but it is what it is.

16:18.875 --> 16:21.750
Look, I've had a long night, I had
a mishap at another client's house

16:21.750 --> 16:24.833
and I'm over here having
another mishap with another client.

16:24.833 --> 16:27.541
Just a little fun fact about me,
I call them clients.

16:27.541 --> 16:29.958
Excuse me.
I got stuff to do, gifts to give.

16:29.958 --> 16:31.166
Hey.

16:33.291 --> 16:35.250
My man, you gotta stop.

16:35.250 --> 16:37.958
Alright, I'm gonna frisk you
just to be safe.

16:38.375 --> 16:41.583
You know something?
Have at it, frisk away.

16:41.583 --> 16:44.333
Now, watch out, though, I'm ticklish.

16:44.333 --> 16:45.583
- Turn around.
- Alright.

16:46.250 --> 16:49.208
You know, going around the globe,
giving out gifts,

16:49.208 --> 16:51.750
no creatures stirring, not even a...

16:53.208 --> 16:54.208
What is this?

16:55.000 --> 16:56.125
Those are carrots.

16:56.125 --> 16:57.875
Those are apparently my snacks.

16:57.875 --> 17:01.708
The missus said I need to eat healthier
so she decided to give me carrots.

17:01.708 --> 17:04.000
She thinks this will wean me
off the cookies.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.791
Hasn't worked so far.

17:06.875 --> 17:08.250
This is sad.

17:09.375 --> 17:12.125
- What's your name?
- My name is Nicholas Sinter-Claus.

17:12.125 --> 17:13.916
Nicholas Sinter-Claus?

17:14.458 --> 17:16.041
I'll slow it down for you.

17:17.208 --> 17:18.625
Sinter...

17:18.625 --> 17:20.833
Claus.

17:20.833 --> 17:23.500
Sinter-Claus.

17:23.958 --> 17:26.541
Oh, like Santa Claus.

17:26.541 --> 17:28.333
- Yes!
- That's cute.

17:28.333 --> 17:30.958
Wow, that was like pulling teeth.

17:30.958 --> 17:33.875
- And what's that for?
- This is my naughty and nice list.

17:33.875 --> 17:35.208
An iPad?

17:35.208 --> 17:38.666
That's right, we've modernized it
by still keeping it traditional.

17:38.666 --> 17:40.875
If I can get this thing unlocked.

17:42.250 --> 17:43.291
Wait...

17:46.333 --> 17:47.958
I can't unlock it.

17:47.958 --> 17:50.375
Somebody else
must've did the face recognition.

17:50.375 --> 17:52.708
Try your face. Okay, your face don't work.

17:52.708 --> 17:53.875
Well...

17:54.416 --> 17:56.375
Looks like I'm gonna have to freestyle.

17:56.875 --> 17:58.375
Oh, man, am I behind.

17:58.375 --> 18:01.875
If I don't make it back for sunrise yoga,
Mrs. Claus is gonna be mad.

18:01.875 --> 18:04.916
- She loves my flexibility.
-  So, we'll get you looked at

18:04.916 --> 18:07.000
and then we'll talk
about things from there.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.291
- Oh no, I gotta call the boss.
- No, I will call the boss.

18:14.708 --> 18:16.458
Dad, is everything okay?

18:16.458 --> 18:20.416
Everything is fine, I just need to take
this nice man here to the doctor.

18:20.416 --> 18:23.166
I'm gonna call your mom
and tell her to come get you.

18:23.166 --> 18:24.625
What? Now?

18:24.625 --> 18:27.500
I know, it's just that this man
really needs help, okay?

18:27.500 --> 18:29.208
Umm, hey, how you doing?

18:29.208 --> 18:31.958
Your name is Charlotte, right?

18:31.958 --> 18:34.583
- How do you know her name?
- Yes, who are you?

18:34.583 --> 18:38.083
Come on, when you see all this,
you can't tell who I am?

18:38.083 --> 18:40.250
- What about the white beard?
- Yeah.

18:40.250 --> 18:42.250
Don't you think
if you gonna claim to be Santa,

18:42.250 --> 18:44.125
that you should include
his signature attribute?

18:44.125 --> 18:47.291
Okay, look, the whole
white beard thing is a myth.

18:47.291 --> 18:48.833
Started by the Scandinavians.

18:48.833 --> 18:52.625
As soon as they said I had a big
white beard and a little curly mustache,

18:52.625 --> 18:54.041
everybody believed it.

18:55.458 --> 18:59.458
Okay, fine, I dyed it, alright?
I'm going through a midlife crisis.

18:59.458 --> 19:03.000
I am 1,462 years old.

19:03.000 --> 19:07.125
If I wanna look younger
for at least three years, I deserve that.

19:07.583 --> 19:10.416
So, you're Santa, huh?
When were you born?

19:10.875 --> 19:12.916
A lot of questions, little Oprah.

19:12.916 --> 19:15.291
- I was born in 200 AD.
- And where?

19:15.875 --> 19:18.166
- Alright, uh, Anatolia.
- What's Anatolia?

19:18.625 --> 19:19.875
And you're Gayle, too.

19:21.125 --> 19:23.208
Anatolia is what Turkey is now.

19:23.208 --> 19:26.750
You speak pretty good English
for a guy who was born in Turkey.

19:26.750 --> 19:27.875
I'm very diverse.

19:27.875 --> 19:31.291
I speak 172 languages and dialects.

19:31.291 --> 19:33.833
Baby, I'mma take you home first, alright?

19:33.833 --> 19:36.625
And then I'll deal with Mr. Sinter...

19:38.083 --> 19:39.083
Nick.

19:39.083 --> 19:40.958
You know something, I do need help.

19:40.958 --> 19:42.041
Luring my reindeer.

19:42.041 --> 19:44.166
The reindeer.

19:44.166 --> 19:45.916
How do you do that?

19:45.916 --> 19:47.875
Now, Prancer has separation anxiety,

19:47.875 --> 19:49.750
and Dancer hasn't been eating well.

19:49.750 --> 19:51.875
Yeah, he's got somebody with him.

19:51.875 --> 19:53.875
So, what do you want us to do?

19:53.875 --> 19:56.916
Dr. Galoshes said it could be
a stomach flu, I don't know.

19:56.916 --> 19:59.458
- Dr. Galoshes?
- Yeah, Dr. Galoshes.

19:59.458 --> 20:02.708
Dr. Galoshes is the best
penguin doctor in the North Pole.

20:02.708 --> 20:05.083
And see,
it's not because he treats penguins,

20:05.083 --> 20:08.458
it's because he's a penguin
that's actually a doctor.

20:10.125 --> 20:11.666
Now, check this out.

20:11.666 --> 20:14.208
This little clicker
is powered by Christmas spirit.

20:14.208 --> 20:15.666
Look at the sky right now.

20:16.875 --> 20:20.166
What you're about to witness
is a sleigh being pulled

20:20.166 --> 20:24.041
by eight bold and beautiful reindeer.

20:31.625 --> 20:33.416
Must have mis-paired the Bluetooth.

20:33.416 --> 20:37.416
Baby, as you can see, this guy
definitely needs some help, okay?

20:37.416 --> 20:40.083
He's trying to call reindeer
out of the sky.

20:40.083 --> 20:43.791
I'm gonna drop you off first
and take this man where he needs to go.

20:43.791 --> 20:46.708
You know something,
I definitely need to be checked out.

20:46.708 --> 20:49.083
I'll check on these reindeer later,
you know?

20:49.083 --> 20:51.125
Yeah, we should do that.

20:51.125 --> 20:52.333
Like I've been saying.

20:59.291 --> 21:00.291
What?

21:01.083 --> 21:02.750
Santa fun fact number two,

21:02.750 --> 21:04.833
- I sweat glitter.

21:04.833 --> 21:06.416
That is so cool!

21:06.416 --> 21:07.791
Here we are...

21:09.708 --> 21:11.375
Comet, Vixen...

21:11.375 --> 21:14.041
Bro, you doing way too much.

21:17.291 --> 21:19.333
- You know my friend, David Banks?
- Yeah?

21:19.333 --> 21:21.208
His dad said that Santa is Black.

21:21.208 --> 21:23.333
They just changed all the history books.

21:23.333 --> 21:25.500
First of all,
I love little Davie Banks.

21:25.500 --> 21:27.041
He is having an amazing year,

21:27.041 --> 21:30.208
that's one kid who won't be getting
cauliflower this year.

21:31.208 --> 21:34.625
- Cauliflower?
- Yeah, we phased out coal a few years ago

21:34.625 --> 21:37.583
'cause of the whole ecological,
you know, stuff going on.

21:37.583 --> 21:39.416
Burning coal, there's a lot of it.

21:39.416 --> 21:42.458
So, if you're naughty, you get a lump
of cauliflower in your stocking.

21:42.458 --> 21:44.250
Dad, he is really Santa!

21:44.875 --> 21:47.291
My real name is Nicholas Sinter-Claus.

21:47.916 --> 21:49.500
Hyphenated, Santo.

21:49.500 --> 21:51.541
You know, I took Mrs. Claus' last name.

21:51.541 --> 21:54.208
We're progressive up there,
you gotta move with the times.

21:54.208 --> 21:58.541
But I also got a few nicknames,
we got K Cringe, we got S Clau,

21:58.541 --> 22:00.541
we got Ro-ho-ho.

22:00.541 --> 22:03.416
Oh, my favorite, Gifty McPresents.

22:03.958 --> 22:05.041
The Third.

22:05.041 --> 22:07.583
Okay, so, if you're really Santa Claus,

22:07.583 --> 22:10.333
then tell me
what Charlotte wants for Christmas.

22:10.750 --> 22:14.291
First of all, she wants
a <i>Rise Up, Sing Out</i> t-shirt, right?

22:14.291 --> 22:17.208
Number two, she wants
the Anna and Elsa dolls,

22:17.208 --> 22:19.083
'cause she loves <i>Frozen.</i>

22:19.083 --> 22:21.375
She wants a pretend make-up kit

22:21.375 --> 22:24.791
and lastly, she wants a pink scooter.

22:24.791 --> 22:27.583
He's right! Oh my gosh, see Dad?

22:28.125 --> 22:32.000
I've never met an eight-year-old girl
that did not want a pretend make-up set.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.666
Eddie, would you happen
to have some cookies

22:35.666 --> 22:38.000
or other affiliated baked goods?

22:38.000 --> 22:40.875
I'd take a Girl Scout cookie,
a vanilla wafer,

22:40.875 --> 22:43.125
I'd do oatmeal raisin,
I just need a cookie.

22:43.125 --> 22:45.500
Oh and look,
I got a doctor's note right here

22:45.500 --> 22:47.500
that says I can have the snacks.

22:47.500 --> 22:49.500
Let me guess, from a penguin?

22:49.500 --> 22:51.958
No, from my other doctor,
Dr. Buttons.

22:51.958 --> 22:56.875
Look, I'm sorry for the penmanship.
Dr. Buttons is a cat that paints.

22:56.875 --> 23:00.250
- W... Where did you get this?
- My secret Santa pocket.

23:01.666 --> 23:03.250
I checked all your pockets.

23:03.708 --> 23:06.958
Yeah, that's why it's called
a secret pocket.

23:06.958 --> 23:08.958
I keep all types of things in there.

23:08.958 --> 23:11.791
I got reindeer food in there,
uh, I keep yak repellent.

23:11.791 --> 23:13.708
Oh, I got tinsel, like, removers,

23:13.708 --> 23:17.125
a little brush, you knock
the tinsel right off, comes off easily.

23:17.125 --> 23:20.166
Also, do you understand
that I'm missing work right now?

23:20.166 --> 23:22.125
This is the first time
in thousands of years.

23:22.125 --> 23:24.000
I've never missed a night.

23:24.000 --> 23:27.041
Sorry, Nick, my dad
sort of hates Christmas.

23:28.333 --> 23:31.125
That's okay, Charlotte,
he has his reasons.

23:32.458 --> 23:35.041
Hey, what are you talking about,
I have my reasons?

23:35.041 --> 23:36.333
What does that mean?

23:36.333 --> 23:39.083
Eddie, I know everything.

23:39.083 --> 23:42.083
I know everything,
that's not just like a slogan.

23:42.083 --> 23:44.291
- No, it is a fact.
- I'm sorry, wait, wait.

23:45.291 --> 23:47.666
What's that smell? Do y'all smell that?

23:48.583 --> 23:50.875
-  What is that?
- What smell?

23:50.875 --> 23:53.666
I don't know, it kinda smells like...
Like cinnamon.

23:55.583 --> 23:57.291
That would be me.

23:57.291 --> 24:00.458
- What would be you?
- Santa fun fact, it's number three.

24:01.708 --> 24:04.500
Santa farts smell like cinnamon.

24:04.500 --> 24:06.458
- I'm sorry, what?

24:09.000 --> 24:10.458
Oh, there he is.

24:19.916 --> 24:21.916
- Pull over.

24:21.916 --> 24:23.791
- What?
-  Pull over!

24:23.791 --> 24:25.125
No.

24:27.375 --> 24:28.916
What are they, nuts?

24:30.250 --> 24:31.250
Oh no!

24:32.666 --> 24:35.833
- Man, who are they?
- It looks like a snowman and an elf...

24:35.833 --> 24:38.375
And a nutcracker,
AKA every Tuesday at my house.

24:40.208 --> 24:41.791
Are you kidding me? Go!

24:52.541 --> 24:55.833
- Oh... Oh no!

25:00.541 --> 25:01.791
I think we lost them.

25:01.791 --> 25:03.791
- Are you okay, baby?
- Yeah.

25:03.791 --> 25:05.000
What was that?

25:05.000 --> 25:07.458
Man, you know people
get crazy on Christmas Eve.

25:07.458 --> 25:10.291
- This stuff happens all the time.
- Come on, come on.

25:10.291 --> 25:13.166
No, no, don't do this to me now.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.583
Unbelievable.

25:27.291 --> 25:29.041
-  Hello?
- We lost him.

25:29.041 --> 25:30.666
How is that possible?

25:30.666 --> 25:33.291
I don't know, it's been a long night, sir.

25:33.291 --> 25:35.791
- You know what else is long, Mary?
- <i>What's that?</i>

25:35.791 --> 25:38.125
- Prison sentences.
- Oh, Congressman...

25:38.125 --> 25:41.583
But let's not torture ourselves
thinking about what can happen to us

25:41.583 --> 25:43.750
if that thing falls into the wrong hands.

25:43.750 --> 25:44.875
My house is a wreck!

25:44.875 --> 25:47.291
- I know, I'm sorry, sir.
<i>- Bologna soup.</i>

25:47.291 --> 25:49.583
Fish patties. Turkey-fried turkey.

25:49.583 --> 25:52.125
These are some of the things
they serve in prison.

25:52.125 --> 25:55.125

25:55.500 --> 25:56.625

26:58.291 --> 27:01.208
I don't need a cell phone.
If I need to message somebody,

27:01.208 --> 27:03.208
all I gotta do
is call my flock of puffins.

27:03.208 --> 27:04.291

27:14.958 --> 27:16.375
P... Puffins?

27:19.125 --> 27:21.041
You know something, I forgot.

27:21.041 --> 27:22.875
I gave them the holidays off.

27:24.500 --> 27:27.541
This is what I'm gonna go,
I'mma take you down to Atlanta PD.

27:27.541 --> 27:29.708
See, I got a friend named Bobby Carlotta.

27:29.708 --> 27:32.250
I went to high school with him,
now he's a detective

27:32.250 --> 27:35.541
and he can get you to the hospital,
get you the help that you need.

27:35.541 --> 27:37.000
Simple as that.

27:37.000 --> 27:40.375
Then you and I, Baby Girl,
we can go to your mom's and wait.

27:40.375 --> 27:42.791
I can't believe she's still out shopping.

27:42.791 --> 27:44.625
Oh, she loves last-minute shopping.

27:44.625 --> 27:47.625
Which is fine by me. Shop, mamma, shop!

27:47.625 --> 27:49.708
Ooh, I love that. Shop, mamma, shop.

27:49.708 --> 27:51.625
- Shop, mamma, shop!
- Shop, mamma, shop!

27:51.625 --> 27:53.916
- Please don't stop.
- Please don't stop.

27:53.916 --> 27:56.250
- Go to all the stores.
- By them gifts galore.

27:56.250 --> 27:57.916
Shop, mamma, shop!

27:59.125 --> 28:02.250
- Wow, that was fun.
- Y'all make such a great little team.

28:02.250 --> 28:04.625
- She's amazing.
-  I love it. Um...

28:06.125 --> 28:08.833
When I bring you in,
I'mma do you a little solid, okay?

28:08.833 --> 28:11.750
When I talk to Bobby,
I won't mention the breaking and entering.

28:11.750 --> 28:15.125
Okay? I'm just gonna let him know
that you might be an individual

28:15.125 --> 28:17.250
that is going through a bit of a crisis.

28:17.250 --> 28:19.500
- And needs an evaluation.
- Mm-hmm.

28:19.500 --> 28:21.166
You get where I'm coming from?

28:21.166 --> 28:22.583
- Oh, I got you.
- Okay.

28:22.583 --> 28:24.416
But you know who you need to help?

28:24.875 --> 28:27.708
Bobby Carlotta, your classmate.

28:28.375 --> 28:31.250
Loves Union Pacific train sets,
that's right.

28:31.958 --> 28:33.833
I've given him one every Christmas.

28:33.833 --> 28:36.875
But he doesn't want nobody
in the precinct to know

28:36.875 --> 28:41.500
that he loves to sit at home
and play with train sets.

28:41.500 --> 28:42.833
Got me?

28:43.416 --> 28:45.708
Yeah, got you.

28:46.208 --> 28:49.375
Just like you're a grown man
acting like Santa.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.291
Kinda like that?

28:58.375 --> 29:01.208
- Anything?
- No, we lost him.

29:01.666 --> 29:03.791
Oh, wait, there he is. We got him.

29:03.791 --> 29:06.416
-  Where?
- Up here, make a left at the light.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.291
Hey, how's it going?

29:20.291 --> 29:24.416
- I'm just checking on y'all.
- Listen, she is having a ball.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.833
Oh, really? Well, that is amazing.

29:27.833 --> 29:32.083
Well, I was hoping that maybe
once you drop her off,

29:32.541 --> 29:36.500
<i>we could have a drink,
'cause I found this really cute recipe</i>

29:36.500 --> 29:39.250
for peppermintinis
where you coat the glass

29:39.250 --> 29:40.875
with crushed candy cane and...

29:40.875 --> 29:43.458
Wow, that definitely sounds great.

29:43.458 --> 29:45.708
- <i>We might be just a little late.</i>
- Wait, why?

29:45.708 --> 29:46.791
<i>Um...</i>

29:47.833 --> 29:50.583
Daddy-daughter fun times,
just like you said.

29:50.583 --> 29:52.875
<i>Daddy-daughter fun time. [chuckles]</i>

29:52.875 --> 29:56.458
Okay, well, I'm finishing up
this last-minute shopping

29:56.458 --> 29:59.666
and I'll see you soon for peppermintinis.

29:59.666 --> 30:01.500
Yeah, can't wait.

30:01.500 --> 30:03.041
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

30:05.625 --> 30:07.625
We really need to get home.

30:07.625 --> 30:10.083
Mom and Dad are separated,
they see a therapist.

30:10.083 --> 30:12.833
- Charlotte.
- It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

30:12.833 --> 30:16.166
Therapy's a good thing.
Me and Mrs. Claus see a therapist too.

30:16.166 --> 30:17.875
Let me guess, another penguin?

30:17.875 --> 30:20.500
No, our therapist is not a penguin, Eddie.

30:20.500 --> 30:22.291
He's a walrus.

30:22.291 --> 30:24.208
That's right, Arturio Tuskanini.

30:24.208 --> 30:27.625
- Tuskanini?
- Mm-hmm. Dr. Arturio Tuskanini.

30:28.708 --> 30:31.375
Look, Eddie, me and the missus
have rough patches too.

30:31.375 --> 30:33.250
We've been married for centuries.

30:33.250 --> 30:36.333
- Every couple has problems.
- Centuries...

30:36.333 --> 30:37.791
So, what's triggering you?

30:37.791 --> 30:40.041
Hey, that's really none of your business.

30:40.041 --> 30:41.416
I would like to know too.

30:41.416 --> 30:43.125
Why don't you and Mom get along?

30:43.125 --> 30:45.916
Hey, hey, we get along just fine.

30:45.916 --> 30:50.000
It's just sometimes, people,
they... they stop fitting together.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.166
Alright?

30:54.375 --> 30:55.833
I will admit, I...

30:56.833 --> 30:58.916
I don't like when she gets sad either.

31:02.458 --> 31:06.000
I think that there's some things
about tonight we can just leave out.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.125
I mean, like us being downtown.

31:09.500 --> 31:10.875
-  Gotta dash.
- Nick!

31:11.541 --> 31:12.541
Nick!

31:16.708 --> 31:18.000
Nick!

31:22.250 --> 31:23.416
We got you!

31:23.416 --> 31:25.625
- Come on, Charlotte.
- What about his bag?

31:25.625 --> 31:28.083
Don't worry about it,
this man needs our help.

31:34.125 --> 31:35.125
Let's go.

31:35.750 --> 31:39.500
Okay, listen baby,
whatever you do, do not let go of my hand.

31:39.500 --> 31:41.750
Don't worry, I'll protect you.

31:43.750 --> 31:45.125
There's too many of them.

31:46.791 --> 31:47.791

35:50.416 --> 35:51.750
Go, go!

35:52.291 --> 35:54.250
When is this night gonna be over?

35:57.875 --> 35:59.416
He couldn't have gone too far.

35:59.416 --> 36:01.000
Can't we just let him go?

36:01.000 --> 36:03.541
Baby, I want to let him go
and get you home to your mom,

36:03.541 --> 36:05.291
- but I just can't, okay?
- Why?

36:05.291 --> 36:07.708
Because the most important part
of Daddy's job

36:07.708 --> 36:10.333
is to never let someone
who feels sad and alone

36:10.333 --> 36:12.625
keep on feeling sad and alone, okay?

36:12.625 --> 36:14.583
I don't think he feels sad and alone.

36:14.583 --> 36:17.791
I actually think he's one
of the jolliest people I've ever met.

36:17.791 --> 36:20.333
And that's because
you're too young to understand.

36:20.333 --> 36:22.000
No I am not!

36:22.000 --> 36:24.083
You just don't like him
because he's Santa Claus

36:24.083 --> 36:25.541
and you hate Christmas.

36:25.541 --> 36:29.791
He's not Santa Claus
because there's no such thing...

36:34.041 --> 36:35.125
Let's get you home.

36:35.125 --> 36:37.375
Something we should've done
a long time ago.

36:37.375 --> 36:38.750
Look, Dad!

36:39.958 --> 36:42.083
Remember, he sweats glitter.

36:59.375 --> 37:02.083
Nick, that was so cool,
you were incredible!

37:02.083 --> 37:03.833
Oh, thank you!

37:03.833 --> 37:07.041
I would say I missed you,
but it's only been, like 10 minutes.

37:08.291 --> 37:09.541
Hello, Edward.

37:09.541 --> 37:11.875
You mind telling me
what that was back there?

37:11.875 --> 37:14.583
You mean that amazing performance?
I had so much fun.

37:14.583 --> 37:16.083
I never pass up an open mic.

37:16.083 --> 37:18.875
I can do any genre, too.
I can do R&B, I can do jazz...

37:18.875 --> 37:21.583
Yeah, I'm not talking
about the little performance,

37:21.583 --> 37:24.416
I'm talking about you jumping
out of a moving cab.

37:24.416 --> 37:27.000
- Who were you running from?
- Oh, that.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.416
That was nothing.
Charlotte, check this out.

37:29.416 --> 37:30.791
They really got it right.

37:30.791 --> 37:33.875
- So, is this how the North Pole really is?
- It is.

37:33.875 --> 37:37.625
They even depicted
the candy cane department.

37:37.625 --> 37:39.125
That looks amazing but...

37:39.125 --> 37:42.791
Hmm, the only thing missing
is Ms. Paloma Sharp.

37:42.791 --> 37:44.000
Who's she?

37:44.000 --> 37:46.666
She invented the candy cane.

37:46.666 --> 37:50.250
So, her dad was really old,
really elderly, right?

37:50.250 --> 37:53.541
And he broke his ankles,
so she created crutches out of caramel

37:53.541 --> 37:55.625
but they really wasn't sturdy, so...

37:55.625 --> 37:58.458
So instead of crutches,
she gave him a cane.

37:58.458 --> 38:01.208
- That's right, they called it the...
-  Candy cane!

38:02.333 --> 38:04.500
Can I have a word with you
for a second, please?

38:04.500 --> 38:06.708
You can have a whole paragraph
if you want to.

38:06.708 --> 38:08.958
Okay, listen, I'm trying to be
as compassionate as I can be.

38:08.958 --> 38:12.250
I wanna help you, but you gotta
stop messing with my kid's head.

38:12.250 --> 38:15.166
She's a sweet girl
who's just overly trusting

38:15.166 --> 38:17.125
with this wild imagination.

38:17.125 --> 38:18.375
Let me get this straight,

38:18.375 --> 38:20.875
you don't think that's great
characteristics for a person to have?

38:20.875 --> 38:23.125
Not if it's gonna set her up
for disappointment.

38:23.125 --> 38:26.375
Life is hard and as her father,
I have to protect her.

38:27.291 --> 38:28.416
You understand?

38:28.958 --> 38:29.958
Yeah.

38:31.250 --> 38:33.750
I understand that you need
a puppy for Christmas.

38:33.750 --> 38:35.083
- That's right.
- A puppy?

38:35.083 --> 38:37.958
- Mm-hmm.
- I don't want a puppy for Christmas.

38:37.958 --> 38:40.375
Oh, yes, you do 'cause puppies are loving

38:40.375 --> 38:44.333
and soft and when you're mad,
they just knock down the walls with love.

38:44.333 --> 38:46.333
Love is like a bulldozer...

38:48.500 --> 38:50.916
Bulldozer is a perfect name for a puppy!

38:50.916 --> 38:52.250
Yeah!

38:52.250 --> 38:55.166
I don't want a puppy
named Bulldozer for Christmas!

38:55.166 --> 38:57.666
- I want you to have a puppy, Dad.
- Char, please...

38:58.708 --> 39:00.291
- Nick!
- Come on.

39:00.291 --> 39:01.916
- Come on.
- Nick!

39:01.916 --> 39:04.250
Wait. Nick. Nick!

39:05.125 --> 39:08.625
Listen, I know in your world
you don't like to give straight answers,

39:08.625 --> 39:10.458
but who is that following us?

39:10.458 --> 39:12.125
I don't know, I really don't.

39:12.125 --> 39:15.708
But what I do know is there's
two billion children all over the world

39:15.708 --> 39:18.291
expecting me to deliver
Christmas gifts tonight.

39:18.291 --> 39:21.000
Whatever, fine,
but we need to call an Uber, okay?

39:21.000 --> 39:22.750
Maybe my phone is working again...

39:23.458 --> 39:26.083
I bedazzled it. You're welcome.

39:26.083 --> 39:27.875
- When did you do this?

39:27.875 --> 39:31.583
I did it in the cab while we were
being chased by those bad guys.

39:32.666 --> 39:35.500
Don't bling anything else
of mine, or else.

39:35.833 --> 39:38.625
- Do you hear me?

39:38.625 --> 39:41.333
Saint Nick! Hello!

39:44.833 --> 39:47.500
- Nick, where you going?
- Our ride is here.

39:47.500 --> 39:49.541
Dad, our ride is here!

39:49.541 --> 39:51.125
What ride, what're y'all...

39:51.125 --> 39:52.375
Hey, hey!

39:53.708 --> 39:55.625
Hey! Hey!

39:56.541 --> 39:57.583
What are you doing?

39:57.583 --> 40:00.291
These people 'bout to take us
to safety and there's room for us all.

40:00.291 --> 40:01.875
- Charlotte, come on.
- Hey, hey.

40:01.875 --> 40:04.125
We are not getting in a van
with strangers.

40:04.125 --> 40:05.958
Oh, Eddie, they're not strangers.

40:05.958 --> 40:07.458
I know exactly who they are.

40:07.458 --> 40:09.625
- See, he knows who they are.
-  There!

40:09.625 --> 40:12.625
Come on, Eddie, time's a-wastin',
we gotta get out of here.

40:12.625 --> 40:15.458
- Come on, get in. Yes!

40:28.458 --> 40:31.083
- It is really you?
- Yep, it's me in the flesh.

40:31.083 --> 40:33.291
This is a dream come true.
It's incredible.

40:33.291 --> 40:35.875
-  And he's in our van.
- Where'd you get those boots?

40:35.875 --> 40:37.041
This is unbelievable!

40:37.041 --> 40:38.625
- Santa.
- I know!

40:38.625 --> 40:41.666
I'm sorry, can you take us
to the Atlanta Police Department?

40:41.666 --> 40:44.541
- 1045 Young Boulevard.
- Absolutely not.

40:44.541 --> 40:47.333
We're the Truckles.
I'm Sonia, that's Kayleigh,

40:47.333 --> 40:50.208
and Diego and up here
at the wheel is Martin.

40:50.208 --> 40:52.125
Holly jolly, Señor Claus.

40:52.125 --> 40:53.625
Holly jolly it is.

40:53.625 --> 40:56.041
Let me tell you,
I am so happy to meet y'all.

40:56.041 --> 40:57.916
What? I thought you knew them.

40:57.916 --> 41:00.666
I do know who they are.
They are my fans.

41:00.666 --> 41:02.708
- The biggest fans.
-  Number one.

41:02.708 --> 41:04.125
- Ever.
- Super fans!

41:04.125 --> 41:05.333
I love it!

41:05.333 --> 41:07.583
- Truckle gang, give me an H.
-  H!

41:07.583 --> 41:08.916
- Give me an O.
-  O!

41:08.916 --> 41:12.333
That's the flow, now run that back for me
three times, what do ya get?

41:12.333 --> 41:13.708
Ho-ho-ho!

41:13.708 --> 41:15.083
We do Christmas!

41:15.083 --> 41:16.875
- Oh my God, okay.

41:16.875 --> 41:19.125
- Honey, please. Keep us safe.
- Holly jolly.

41:19.125 --> 41:22.333
- We are not gonna crash tonight.
- Not with our precious cargo.

41:22.333 --> 41:23.416
And the kids.

41:23.416 --> 41:26.000
Yeah, okay, you do Christmas,
but what's your job?

41:26.000 --> 41:27.541
What do you do for a living?

41:27.541 --> 41:30.208
- We're the Santa Seekers.
- The Santa Seekers?

41:30.208 --> 41:31.666
- We seek Santa.
- Whoa, whoa...

41:31.666 --> 41:34.000
So I'm looking at all this equipment here.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.875
- This is how you found me?
- Yeah.

41:35.875 --> 41:38.083
- I made all this.
- Our Kayleigh is a whizz

41:38.083 --> 41:39.375
with the computer stuff.

41:39.375 --> 41:41.166
Every Christmas, Kayleigh hacks

41:41.166 --> 41:43.500
into NORAD systems
so we can track on our own.

41:43.500 --> 41:46.833
We discovered Santa was just
a few blocks away from where we were.

41:46.833 --> 41:50.583
At Tommy Tom-Tom's All Night Greek eating
our traditional Christmas Spanakopeeta.

41:50.583 --> 41:51.666
Spanakopita, honey.

41:51.666 --> 41:52.958
Tommy Tom-Tom's!

41:52.958 --> 41:55.166
On Elm Street, that's right, Tommy wanted

41:55.166 --> 41:59.916
a kebab slicer for Christmas
and a vertical broiler

41:59.916 --> 42:02.166
because his old one's pretty much broken.

42:02.166 --> 42:05.000
- Those get really hot, too.
- That's the Santa Signature.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.666
- See how it moves as we move?
-  That's so neat!

42:07.666 --> 42:10.833
Sorry, does anybody have a phone?
I need to call the police.

42:10.833 --> 42:13.416
- And mine is, uh...
- What happened to it?

42:13.416 --> 42:14.750
He happened to it.

42:14.750 --> 42:16.083
Guilty as charged.

42:16.083 --> 42:18.625
- It's beautiful.
-  Amazing.

42:18.625 --> 42:20.375
Please do not encourage him.

42:20.375 --> 42:22.041
Oh, this is the perfect time

42:22.041 --> 42:25.666
for my "Songs for when I finally
find Santa" Spotify playlist.

42:25.666 --> 42:29.458
- No, you don't have to do that for us.
- Yes, hit it, Kayleigh!

42:29.458 --> 42:31.791
No, no, don't do that.
There's no need.

42:31.791 --> 42:33.958
Tell us something about the reindeer
that no one knows.

42:33.958 --> 42:37.958
Well, check this out, here's
a little known Santa fun fact number four.

42:37.958 --> 42:40.416
- Come on.
- We know reindeer love to fly.

42:40.416 --> 42:43.625
But they have other skillsets
like they're good at giftwrapping,

42:43.625 --> 42:45.750
they can make pasta from scratch.

42:45.750 --> 42:48.000
Matter of fact,
they make a mean pot roast.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.958
The meat comes off the bone!

42:51.000 --> 42:54.291
But, what they're most skilled at
is protecting Santa Claus.

42:55.291 --> 42:58.041
That's right,
they all got a bunch of special skills.

42:58.916 --> 43:02.166
So if you mess with Santa,
you messing with the reindeer.

43:02.166 --> 43:05.250
-  Really? Wow.
-  Oh, and another one.

43:05.250 --> 43:07.208
They do not like Christmas music.

43:07.208 --> 43:08.458
No way.

43:08.458 --> 43:11.000
Matter of fact, their favorite song
is the theme from <i>Rocky.</i>

43:11.000 --> 43:13.416
-  Who doesn't?
- That's ludicrous.

43:13.416 --> 43:15.250
It's true. Well, this is my stop.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.333
Not again.
What's up with this guy?

43:23.541 --> 43:25.500
The turtle dove
has flown the coop, honey.

43:25.500 --> 43:27.416
The partridge left the pear tree.

43:27.416 --> 43:30.916
Hey, listen, did we offend Saint Nicholas
with all of our questions?

43:30.916 --> 43:32.291
Char, come on.

43:32.291 --> 43:35.250
Listen, I already told you,
he's not Saint Nicholas, okay?

43:35.250 --> 43:37.333
- Of course he is.
- Of course he is.

43:37.333 --> 43:39.833
Buddy, 1045 Young Boulevard,
I'll take you there.

43:39.833 --> 43:42.625
- We're good, just keep doing Christmas...
-  Don't slam the door.

43:42.625 --> 43:44.500
You just made the naughty list.

43:44.500 --> 43:47.083
I can't believe
he just jumped out of the van.

43:47.083 --> 43:49.166
Dad, aren't we going to find Nick?

43:49.166 --> 43:52.208
Nah, I think maybe you were right.
Maybe we just let him go.

43:52.208 --> 43:55.166
I mean, if he wants to keep playing Santa
all night, let him play.

43:55.166 --> 43:56.958
It's not like he's hurting anybody.

43:56.958 --> 43:59.458
What about you saying
the most important part of your job

43:59.458 --> 44:02.291
was to never let someone
who was feeling sad and alone

44:02.291 --> 44:04.000
keep on feeling sad and alone?

44:04.000 --> 44:07.416
What about you saying
he was the jolliest person ever?

44:07.416 --> 44:10.750
- Remember that, huh?
- I just think he might need our help, Dad.

44:10.750 --> 44:12.375
Whether he's Santa or not.

44:18.916 --> 44:21.166
Come on, Dad!

44:25.750 --> 44:26.750
Nick.

44:27.458 --> 44:30.250
- What is going on?
- Look, I recognized the neighborhood.

44:30.250 --> 44:32.250
And I was like, wait a minute,
I got some associates here.

44:32.250 --> 44:34.500
So I figured we go in,
you call your police

44:34.500 --> 44:36.333
and I get some supplies.

44:36.333 --> 44:37.708
<i>Who is it?</i>

44:38.375 --> 44:41.041
- It's me, Boss Tinsel.
- <i>Oh my God, Nick?</i>

44:41.041 --> 44:43.708
Come on, Dad, can't we just go inside

44:43.708 --> 44:46.166
and use the phone
to get him the help he needs?

44:47.458 --> 44:50.083
These associates of yours,
they better not make any trouble.

44:50.083 --> 44:53.000
Oh, come on,
my associates don't make trouble.

44:53.500 --> 44:57.041
- My associates make toys.
- Dad, come on!

44:57.041 --> 44:59.000
He said they make toys.

44:59.583 --> 45:03.583
Okay, look Eddie, I get it, right?
You don't believe I am who I am.

45:04.000 --> 45:05.000
Fine.

45:05.000 --> 45:08.000
But let me show you something
that'll completely change your mind.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.083
Come with me.

45:12.416 --> 45:16.625
<i>♪ On the first day of Christmas
my true love gave to me ♪</i>

45:19.375 --> 45:20.625

45:44.958 --> 45:46.458
What up? It is Christmas.

45:46.458 --> 45:48.958
I mean, the most magical time
of the year, Eddie.

45:48.958 --> 45:51.541
I get it, you're a doubter,
you don't believe in anything.

45:51.541 --> 45:54.291
But I ran into my fair share
of doubters in my time.

45:54.291 --> 45:58.125
But once I show them
this wonderful workshop full of toys,

45:58.125 --> 46:00.500
everybody's converted, check this out.

46:03.291 --> 46:07.083
I mean, when you see all these toys,
your mind is gonna be blown.

46:13.666 --> 46:17.041
Um, Nick, where are all the toys?

46:17.041 --> 46:19.375
Yeah, Nick, where are all the toys?

46:19.375 --> 46:21.083
Yes, the toys.

46:22.458 --> 46:26.208
You know what, the elves,
the elves took it on the road

46:26.208 --> 46:29.000
because it's already Christmas morning
in Australia.

46:29.000 --> 46:30.916
Or maybe Christmas afternoon.

46:30.916 --> 46:33.916
Maybe Christmas evening.
I'm not really good at time zones.

46:33.916 --> 46:36.208
You would think I would be,
but I'm terrible.

46:36.583 --> 46:38.833
You know, Gerald and Lucille
will explain everything.

46:38.833 --> 46:40.666
Let's go inside and meet the crew.

46:42.791 --> 46:44.416
There he is, my man.

46:44.416 --> 46:47.750
Sorry skip, we finished the work early
so we started the party.

46:47.750 --> 46:50.833
Of course you did,
that explains why there's no toys.

46:50.833 --> 46:53.958
Hello, Nick.
And who is this cuteness?

46:53.958 --> 46:57.666
This little pepper right here
is Charlotte and that's her father, Eddie.

46:58.541 --> 47:00.250
Eddie's a non-believer.

47:00.250 --> 47:02.375
Really? Oh, Claustrophobic.

47:03.000 --> 47:06.750
- I'm sorry, what?
- Claustrophobic, fear of Santa Claus.

47:06.750 --> 47:08.625
I'm just gonna ask one more time.

47:08.625 --> 47:10.625
- What is this place?
- Look here, Eddie.

47:10.625 --> 47:13.541
There are two billion families
in over 160 countries

47:13.541 --> 47:15.041
that celebrate Christmas.

47:15.041 --> 47:16.375
Yeah, so?

47:16.375 --> 47:18.916
At an average
of 1.8 children per household,

47:18.916 --> 47:21.583
Nick here delivers gifts
to a bazillion kids.

47:21.583 --> 47:24.000
- A bazillion?
- It's crazy, right?

47:24.000 --> 47:27.166
Yeah, that is.
It's not the only thing crazy.

47:27.166 --> 47:30.541
Look, I can't produce all those toys
at the No' Po' like that.

47:30.541 --> 47:32.250
- So, I outsource.
- That's right.

47:32.250 --> 47:34.375
With satellite operations in every city.

47:34.375 --> 47:36.875
- Did you say No' Po'?
-  Yes, the North Pole.

47:36.875 --> 47:40.291
Oh, Lucille,
please tell me you have some cookies.

47:40.291 --> 47:43.833
I got a test for the quest and found out
that my blood sugar was pretty low.

47:43.833 --> 47:45.125
So, I need some cookies.

47:45.125 --> 47:47.291
Do I have some cookies? Of course!

47:47.291 --> 47:50.291
- Yes!
- To the kitchen, for some cookies.

47:50.291 --> 47:51.458
Dad, cookies!

47:52.541 --> 47:55.500
Gerald and Lucille,
y'all outdid yourselves this Christmas.

47:55.500 --> 47:57.833
Look at these Christmas cookies!

47:58.291 --> 48:00.750
All this deliciousness.

48:01.625 --> 48:05.041
Now, I'm only supposed to have
two cookies, but I might cheat today.

48:05.041 --> 48:08.000
But if I cheat, I gotta call
my weight coach, Dr. Parnis

48:08.000 --> 48:11.041
and Dr. Parnis is a lemming
so if he hears the bad news...

48:11.041 --> 48:13.208
- He might jump off a cliff?
- Exactly.

48:14.958 --> 48:17.875
Oh, Charlotte, look how beautiful
these cookies are.

48:17.875 --> 48:19.875
Hey, would you like to cookie up?

48:20.458 --> 48:22.833
- Dad, can I cookie up?
- No.

48:22.833 --> 48:25.166
- What even is that?
- I'm glad you asked.

48:25.166 --> 48:28.750
See, what you do is you grab
one of these freshly baked cookies

48:28.750 --> 48:31.833
and you put it towards your mouth
like this and then you...

48:31.833 --> 48:33.333
Cookie up, y'all.

48:35.916 --> 48:37.291
Mmm.

48:37.291 --> 48:39.833
It's just eating cookies, I don't see...

48:39.833 --> 48:43.000
Listen, do you have a phone
that I could use, please?

48:43.000 --> 48:45.041
Mm-hmm. It's right over there.

48:54.083 --> 48:56.208
Bet you've never seen one of these before.

49:02.125 --> 49:03.666
- Hello?
- Alli, it's me.

49:03.666 --> 49:06.000
Hi. Where are you guys?

49:06.000 --> 49:07.583
Where are we?

49:07.583 --> 49:09.333
<i>You were supposed
to have her home by 8:30.</i>

49:09.333 --> 49:12.583
Listen, we'll be home soon,
we just got a little sidetracked.

49:12.583 --> 49:13.666
Sidetracked?

49:13.666 --> 49:16.416
- No, no, we're gonna be home soon.
- Where are you guys?

49:16.416 --> 49:18.750
Um... we're downtown.

49:18.750 --> 49:21.333
<i>At this time of night?
What are you doing downtown?</i>

49:21.333 --> 49:22.625
Where is Charlotte?

49:22.625 --> 49:26.041
She's right here by me.
It's a work thing.

49:27.166 --> 49:30.250
Oh my gosh, you actually
found a way to go to work tonight.

49:30.250 --> 49:32.666
- No, no, it's not like that.
- <i>It was one night, Eddie.</i>

49:32.666 --> 49:34.750
I can understand you
maybe disappointing me.

49:34.750 --> 49:36.958
<i>- But to disappoint Charlotte?</i>
- Disappoint?

49:36.958 --> 49:40.541
She is having the time of her life.
Hold on, lemme let you talk to her.

49:40.541 --> 49:43.666
Tell your mom that you're good
and safe and not disappointed.

49:43.666 --> 49:45.416
- Tell her.
- Hi, Mom.

49:45.416 --> 49:48.500
- Baby, hi. Are you okay?
<i>- We're with Santa Claus...</i>

49:48.500 --> 49:51.833
And he has a penguin doctor
and he sweats glitter.

49:51.833 --> 49:54.083
And there's these people,
Lucille and Gerald

49:54.083 --> 49:55.666
and they aren't actually elves...

49:55.666 --> 49:57.041
Oh, okay.

49:57.625 --> 50:00.208
Okay, put your father
back on the phone, please.

50:00.791 --> 50:03.500
- Everything's fine, I told you.
- Bring my child home.

50:03.500 --> 50:04.875
- I will.
<i>- And you know what?</i>

50:04.875 --> 50:08.291
- You can forget about the peppermintinis.
- Alright, I got you.

50:12.416 --> 50:15.416
Problem here is that you've got
some brandy fruitcake crumbs

50:15.416 --> 50:17.208
in the transmitter circuit.

50:17.208 --> 50:19.833
But technically,
I don't see anything wrong.

50:20.375 --> 50:22.625
So, how'd you end up
hanging out with this dude?

50:22.625 --> 50:26.000
Look, the night...
The night started pretty normal.

50:26.000 --> 50:28.625
You know, I was getting
all my out-of-towners out the way,

50:28.625 --> 50:31.500
visiting all the homes
of the folks who are away, right?

50:33.041 --> 50:36.041
<i>The Harf family was supposed
to be in Florida, West Palm.</i>

50:36.916 --> 50:38.708
<i>Or so I thought.</i>

50:39.250 --> 50:42.208
Here's a list of the people
you'll be collecting money from.

50:42.208 --> 50:45.333
<i>What I didn't realize was I was about
to interrupt a crooked congressman</i>

50:45.333 --> 50:48.333
who was being bribed to shut down
the Moonlight Mission.

50:48.333 --> 50:50.541
Password is 4273.

50:50.541 --> 50:52.000
It's my name, Harf.

50:52.000 --> 50:54.333
Oh, one of the stops
is the homeless shelter

50:54.333 --> 50:56.958
that you did the candle-lighting
ceremony at this morning.

50:56.958 --> 50:58.958
That's right, the Moonlight Mission.

50:58.958 --> 51:02.208
Mr. Marty Plaseck is going to pay me
to get his hands on that land.

51:02.208 --> 51:04.458
Yeah, but, what's he want
with a homeless shelter?

51:04.458 --> 51:06.708
He's gonna tear it down
to build a tire store.

51:06.708 --> 51:09.125
What can I say? I'm a bad guy.

51:09.125 --> 51:11.250
<i>Yeah, this guy
was a real carbuncle.</i>

51:14.083 --> 51:16.333
<i>♪ What you gonna get her for Christmas? ♪</i>

51:16.333 --> 51:20.250

51:43.458 --> 51:44.458
Hello?

51:46.208 --> 51:47.208
Excuse me?

51:49.750 --> 51:50.750
You can see me?

51:51.291 --> 51:52.291
Yes.

51:52.291 --> 51:53.750
Um...

51:54.541 --> 51:56.958
- What are you doing here?

51:56.958 --> 51:59.458
What am I doing... this is my house.

51:59.458 --> 52:01.083
This is your house?

52:01.083 --> 52:03.541
Oh, you know something?

52:03.541 --> 52:05.333
I'm with the gas company.

52:06.291 --> 52:07.750
Dressed as Santa?

52:07.750 --> 52:11.375
B... Because we are...
We're rebranding.

52:12.625 --> 52:14.708
We're trying to be more family-friendly.

52:14.708 --> 52:18.250
We've decided to dress according
to the season, so, you know,

52:18.250 --> 52:20.791
on Easter, I am an Easter bunny.

52:20.791 --> 52:23.750
Halloween, I'm Dracula,
the old-school version

52:23.750 --> 52:26.791
with the v-neck hairstyle
and the fangs.

52:27.333 --> 52:31.791
It's all about the children growing up
'cause they're the future bill payers.

52:31.791 --> 52:35.000
And because of that,
the children are the future!

52:38.750 --> 52:40.250
Ow!

52:41.250 --> 52:42.458
Ah!

52:59.000 --> 53:00.833
Alright, that's it! Ah!

53:06.541 --> 53:07.541
Yes.

53:08.416 --> 53:10.375
Hope you and your friends
like cauliflower.

53:10.375 --> 53:11.458
Get him!

53:13.333 --> 53:15.541
And ever since,
these goons have been chasing me.

53:15.541 --> 53:18.125
Wow, you gotta be kidding me.

53:18.666 --> 53:21.583
You put me and my daughter
through this terrible night

53:21.583 --> 53:23.166
all for some bungled burglary?

53:23.166 --> 53:25.500
Eddie, look, it wasn't
some bungling burglary.

53:25.500 --> 53:28.291
All this time,
I thought you really needed help.

53:28.291 --> 53:30.458
I thought you had real issues.

53:30.458 --> 53:32.416
Come to find out
you're just a common crook!

53:32.416 --> 53:34.500
Okay, whoa, take it easy, fella.

53:34.500 --> 53:36.708
- He doesn't mean that.
- Of course I mean it.

53:37.625 --> 53:40.375
So, that's who they were, huh?
The people that tried to run us over.

53:40.375 --> 53:42.375
The ones that's been chasing us all night.

53:42.375 --> 53:44.458
- Is that who you tried to rob?
- He didn't rob anybody.

53:44.458 --> 53:46.541
Zip it, Willy Wonka.

53:46.916 --> 53:50.333
Hey, hey, hey, bring it down.
That's the total opposite of me, okay?

53:50.333 --> 53:52.833
I'm a leaver, not a taker.

53:52.833 --> 53:55.416
All the charades this whole night,
all of the games.

53:55.416 --> 53:57.375
Over! The whole night. Let's go, baby.

53:57.375 --> 53:59.208
You are not gonna
take away everything.

53:59.208 --> 54:01.083
Everything. Even the cookies.

54:01.083 --> 54:02.333
-  No!
-  Yes.

54:06.875 --> 54:07.875
Yes!

54:09.666 --> 54:11.791
Yes! Exactly what I was looking for.

54:11.791 --> 54:14.583
- The night is not over yet.
- It's all fixed.

54:14.583 --> 54:15.791
Thank you.

54:15.791 --> 54:18.208
Bobby, this whole night
is just out of control.

54:18.208 --> 54:19.791
It's been a complete nightmare!

54:19.791 --> 54:21.041
Yeah, you need the address?

54:21.041 --> 54:22.833
- Don't do this, Dad.
- Charlotte, please.

54:22.833 --> 54:24.708
- No.
- 259 Perry Street.

54:24.708 --> 54:27.333
Atlanta, Georgia, 30316.

54:28.750 --> 54:30.333
Alright, everybody, this has been real.

54:30.333 --> 54:32.083
But I'm shutting the circus down.

54:32.083 --> 54:34.083
I'mma get everybody
the help that they need.

54:34.083 --> 54:37.125
That means you, ladies, stop dancing.
Moulin Rouge is over.

54:37.666 --> 54:41.166
Would you like some Christmas caroler
caramel confection?

54:41.166 --> 54:43.875
- Where's Nick?
- On the roof retrieving the reindeer.

54:43.875 --> 54:47.458
Gerald is seeing him out because
Nick has to deliver the gifts tonight.

54:47.458 --> 54:50.000
Oh, he asked me to give you this.

54:56.000 --> 54:59.750
Gerald, thanks for everything,
especially the cookies.

54:59.750 --> 55:01.250
I'll be out your hair
in a minute, okay?

55:01.250 --> 55:02.958
Anything for you, Nick,
you know that.

55:02.958 --> 55:06.000
- Hopefully this thing works.
- It should work.

55:08.541 --> 55:11.541
You know something, Gerald,
I know exactly why it's not working.

55:11.541 --> 55:13.875
It's not working
'cause Eddie doesn't believe.

55:15.333 --> 55:16.333
Nick!

55:17.791 --> 55:19.833
The fun is over. That's it.

55:20.375 --> 55:22.875
You got to stop
with this ridiculous show.

55:22.875 --> 55:27.125
- Wow, you really are a non-believer.
- Enough. Please don't start with that.

55:27.125 --> 55:30.500
- And you're an old-fashioned thinker.
- Bro, you own a fax machine.

55:30.958 --> 55:32.208
And a rotary payphone.

55:32.791 --> 55:35.166
Okay, everyone,
let's be nice and cooperative.

55:36.583 --> 55:38.958
You know, a whole bunch of people
are gonna wake up tomorrow

55:38.958 --> 55:40.791
to discover Christmas is canceled.

55:41.166 --> 55:42.958
- That's on you.
- I'll have to own that.

55:42.958 --> 55:47.416
You know why? 'Cause I actually
prefer Thanksgiving a lot better.

55:47.416 --> 55:48.666
Let's go, sir.

55:49.583 --> 55:51.958
-  What do we do now?
- We improvise.

55:57.708 --> 56:00.000
We'll put out an All Units
on that SUV

56:00.000 --> 56:02.375
but without a license number,
it's gonna be tricky.

56:02.875 --> 56:05.916
If you could just hold him
until Atlanta PD can bring full charges

56:05.916 --> 56:08.875
so I can get Charlotte home to her mother
I would greatly appreciate it.

56:08.875 --> 56:10.708
I don't think you're gonna have to wait.

56:10.708 --> 56:12.708
We got a call
about 10 minutes after yours.

56:12.708 --> 56:15.208
Eddie, this is detectives Jack Finer
and Zachary Strome.

56:15.208 --> 56:17.458
- Nice to meet you.
- With the DeKalb County warrants division.

56:17.458 --> 56:20.583
Turns out your perp's wanted in connection
with a whole spate of B&E's up there.

56:20.583 --> 56:22.250
It's time for Ron to face the music.

56:22.250 --> 56:24.416
- Ron?
- Ron Campbell.

56:25.000 --> 56:27.291
AKA the chimney thief.

56:28.666 --> 56:31.250
- He have any personal items?
- Just this.

56:31.666 --> 56:32.666
What's that?

56:33.333 --> 56:34.625
That's the reindeer clicker.

56:43.333 --> 56:45.041
Eddie, what's going on?

56:45.041 --> 56:47.208
What's going on
is you're not Santa Claus.

56:47.208 --> 56:48.458
You're Ron Campbell.

56:48.458 --> 56:50.416
A burglar from Atlanta.

56:50.416 --> 56:53.041
- But you knew that, right?
- I have a bunch of aliases,

56:53.041 --> 56:54.375
and that's not one of them.

56:54.375 --> 56:57.166
Sometimes I go by Victor Van Vitch,
you got Freddy Cougar.

56:57.166 --> 57:00.041
Mellencamp, that's a good one,
or my new favorite,

57:00.041 --> 57:01.791
Lil Baby Claus.

57:01.791 --> 57:04.000
All the rappers
got Lil and Baby in their names,

57:04.000 --> 57:05.541
so I thought I'd try it too.

57:05.541 --> 57:08.250
Please don't make this
more difficult than it has to be.

57:08.250 --> 57:10.208
Eddie, listen to me.

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
These men are not who they say they are.

57:13.000 --> 57:14.541
That's it, Nick.

57:14.541 --> 57:16.458
Next time, come up with a better story

57:16.916 --> 57:19.000
'cause there's no such thing
as penguin doctors

57:19.000 --> 57:21.625
and reindeer who like to fight
to movie themes.

57:21.625 --> 57:24.458
There's only honest people
and dishonest people.

57:24.458 --> 57:26.458
And you know which one you are, right?

57:29.041 --> 57:30.625
You really don't believe.

57:40.708 --> 57:42.333
Nick, where are you going?

57:44.041 --> 57:46.875
Honestly, I don't even know.

57:48.333 --> 57:50.416
Take care of your dad, okay, Charlotte?

57:52.250 --> 57:53.458
So long.

57:58.541 --> 58:00.875
- Little Bobby Carlotta.
-  Mm-hmm.

58:01.333 --> 58:03.166
No train set for you this Christmas.

58:03.166 --> 58:05.541
I've given you 35 of them.

58:05.541 --> 58:07.041
Play with the old ones.

58:08.583 --> 58:09.833
No choo-choo for you!

58:13.500 --> 58:15.333
No idea what he's talking about.

58:16.208 --> 58:18.125
Dad, don't let them take Nick.

58:18.125 --> 58:19.958
Charlotte, he was being untruthful.

58:19.958 --> 58:21.791
Lying to us the whole night.

58:21.791 --> 58:23.625
Okay? He's not Santa Claus.

58:23.625 --> 58:26.208
I could actually use a snack,
I'm a little hungry.

58:26.208 --> 58:28.750
Can we stop so I can get
some cookies or something?

58:29.458 --> 58:30.458
Where is it?

58:30.958 --> 58:32.833
- The tablet.
- I knew it!

58:32.833 --> 58:34.375
I knew y'all were bad guys.

58:34.375 --> 58:36.000
I had a feeling, right?

58:36.000 --> 58:38.083
I'm supposed to know, it's part of my job.

58:38.083 --> 58:40.166
- To know who's naughty or nice...
- Shut up!

58:40.166 --> 58:42.416
Where is the tablet?

58:42.416 --> 58:45.541
Well, I usually keep the tablet
in my secret Santa pocket,

58:45.541 --> 58:47.833
but guess what,
it's not in there.

58:47.833 --> 58:49.000
Right, right.

58:51.333 --> 58:53.208
You're welcome for us doing your job.

58:53.208 --> 58:55.000
- Did you get it?
- No.

58:55.000 --> 58:58.625
It's gonna take come persuading.
Harf is at the mayor's Christmas party.

58:58.625 --> 58:59.875
See you there.

59:02.500 --> 59:03.500
Yo, Eddie.

59:04.750 --> 59:06.333
Found this in your guy's cell.

59:06.333 --> 59:08.375
He didn't have it
when he was being processed.

59:08.375 --> 59:11.875
Yeah, he has this thing where
he makes stuff disappear somehow.

59:11.875 --> 59:13.375
I can't figure out how he does it.

59:14.000 --> 59:16.333
- Think you could get me an Uber?
- Yeah, I got you.

59:16.708 --> 59:18.041
- I owe you.
- Yeah, you do.

59:39.250 --> 59:40.250
Harf.

59:40.250 --> 59:41.791
H-A-R-F.

59:42.833 --> 59:45.041
Oh, I can't believe it was that easy.

59:45.833 --> 59:46.833
Oh, wow.

59:47.458 --> 59:48.583
What?

59:48.583 --> 59:51.208
Can you believe
this is how they've been tracking us?

59:51.208 --> 59:54.458
- The iPad?
- Yes, these are very bad people, Char.

59:54.958 --> 59:57.000
Doing very bad things.

01:00:11.583 --> 01:00:13.083
Anyone smell cinnamon?

01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:19.958
You know, feelers out there, and if...

01:00:24.083 --> 01:00:25.333
Excuse me, gentlemen.

01:00:26.125 --> 01:00:28.750
Oh my God, he's even trying
to shut down the Moonlight Mission.

01:00:28.750 --> 01:00:31.333
<i>A Christmas tree is like a pair...</i>

01:00:31.333 --> 01:00:33.208
Can you believe that?

01:00:33.208 --> 01:00:35.625
He stands out there popping off
about all the good things

01:00:35.625 --> 01:00:37.500
he's gonna do to that place.

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:41.333
Dad, look, those are
the guys who took Nick.

01:00:41.333 --> 01:00:43.083
We need to help him.

01:00:43.083 --> 01:00:45.916
He may be different
than who we thought he was, Dad,

01:00:45.916 --> 01:00:48.041
but he's not a bad person.

01:00:48.041 --> 01:00:49.291
Okay.

01:00:49.291 --> 01:00:52.333
I'll call my guy, Bobby, at the station
and let him know, okay?

01:00:53.708 --> 01:00:55.708
I gotta un-bedazzle this phone somehow.

01:01:01.041 --> 01:01:03.375
- What's that?
- Remember, Lucille gave it to me.

01:01:03.375 --> 01:01:06.000
Said it was from Nick. Let me see.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.291
<i>Dear Santa, instead of toys this year,</i>

01:01:11.291 --> 01:01:14.000
<i>I would like my parents
to not fight so much</i>

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.333
<i>and to not get a divorce.</i>

01:01:16.333 --> 01:01:18.791
<i>They are Theo and Brenda Garrick.</i>

01:01:18.791 --> 01:01:20.916
<i>I have an idea for you.</i>

01:01:20.916 --> 01:01:23.500
<i>My dad wants a collapsible fishing rod.</i>

01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:26.041
<i>He loves to fish.</i>

01:01:26.041 --> 01:01:29.250
<i>He catches bass and trout and shad,</i>

01:01:29.250 --> 01:01:32.833
<i>so if you could bring him the rod
and he thinks it's from my mom,</i>

01:01:32.833 --> 01:01:34.541
<i>everyone would be happy.</i>

01:01:35.333 --> 01:01:38.000
<i>Thanks and safe travels
this Christmas Eve.</i>

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.083
Your friend, Eddie Garrick.

01:01:44.666 --> 01:01:45.833
We do have to help him.

01:01:46.291 --> 01:01:48.000
- We do?
- Yes, we do.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.333
- But we don't know how to find him.
- Look!

01:01:52.041 --> 01:01:55.958
- Gimme an H, gimme an O...
- You're the smartest girl I know.

01:01:56.625 --> 01:01:58.916
Alright, if you don't want a bad rating,
change of plan.

01:01:58.916 --> 01:02:00.125
New address.

01:02:00.125 --> 01:02:01.208
Whoa.

01:02:02.833 --> 01:02:04.500
Hey, bud, you haven't touched
your chicken.

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:06.625
Oh, honey, don't be disappointed.

01:02:06.625 --> 01:02:08.625
I get it, Santa jumped
out the back of our van

01:02:08.625 --> 01:02:10.375
but at least we got to meet him.

01:02:10.375 --> 01:02:12.083
And he knew who we were.

01:02:12.083 --> 01:02:14.666
He knew who we were,
he knew who you were.

01:02:14.666 --> 01:02:16.083
We need your help.

01:02:16.083 --> 01:02:17.708
-  Oh, hey.
- What's going on?

01:02:17.708 --> 01:02:20.000
- Oh, you.
- What do you need our help for?

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.541
- To find Nick.
- Alright.

01:02:22.541 --> 01:02:24.416
Damn this thing!

01:02:24.416 --> 01:02:27.125
Tony, how many times I tell you, huh?
How many times?

01:02:27.125 --> 01:02:28.666
We need to get a new machine.

01:02:28.666 --> 01:02:30.166
I can't work like this.

01:02:31.708 --> 01:02:32.708
Where is he now?

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000
He's right here!

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.041
- Right where?
- Uptown.

01:02:37.041 --> 01:02:39.375
- Uptown where?
- Looks like the mayor's mansion.

01:02:39.375 --> 01:02:41.666
- Then that's where we have to go.
- What for?

01:02:41.666 --> 01:02:43.000
To save Santa Claus!

01:02:47.083 --> 01:02:49.000
Somebody wants to do Christmas.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.791
No, no, no...

01:02:54.250 --> 01:02:55.500
Okay, let's just go.

01:02:56.291 --> 01:02:58.583
- What do we do?
-  We do Christmas!

01:03:01.416 --> 01:03:03.958
<i>♪ It's Christmas time
and we got the spirit ♪</i>

01:03:03.958 --> 01:03:08.958
<i>♪ Jack Frost chillin</i>', <i>the hawk is out

01:03:08.958 --> 01:03:11.791
Wow, is that snow?

01:03:11.791 --> 01:03:14.875
We haven't had snow on Christmas Eve
in maybe 30 years.

01:03:14.875 --> 01:03:17.958
Not maybe. It's been exactly 30 years.

01:03:17.958 --> 01:03:20.583
<i>♪ We wanna say Merry Christmas
and Happy New Year ♪</i>

01:03:34.041 --> 01:03:36.375
- Where's he at now?
- Just outside the mansion.

01:03:44.666 --> 01:03:47.333
- Are you okay, honey?
- Two months worth of CrossFit, honey.

01:03:47.333 --> 01:03:49.125
-  Alright.

01:03:50.916 --> 01:03:52.750
- Be careful.
- I got this.

01:03:56.541 --> 01:03:58.416
Dad, I wanna go with you.

01:03:58.416 --> 01:04:01.458
Not a chance, you stay here.
You guys keep an eye on her, okay?

01:04:01.958 --> 01:04:04.083
Eddie, don't forget this.

01:04:04.833 --> 01:04:05.833
Hey, Eddie!

01:04:05.833 --> 01:04:07.833
- Huh?
-  Do Christmas.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Yeah.

01:04:17.083 --> 01:04:19.875
Here's what I'm thinking,
I'm thinking you brought me here

01:04:19.875 --> 01:04:22.125
to get the naughty
and nice list, of course,

01:04:22.125 --> 01:04:24.833
but it's not the naughty and nice list
'cause you already have that.

01:04:24.833 --> 01:04:27.500
So, when you're done with the list,
just give it back to me

01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:29.375
so I can finish my deliveries
for the night.

01:04:29.375 --> 01:04:30.833
- Hello.

01:04:30.833 --> 01:04:32.291
<i>Let me see him.</i>

01:04:34.291 --> 01:04:35.500
<i>Where's my tablet?</i>

01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:38.416
Like I told your associates,
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:04:38.416 --> 01:04:40.291
<i>You were in my house looking for it.</i>

01:04:40.291 --> 01:04:42.916
<i>- Who do you work for?</i>
- That's been a debate for generations.

01:04:42.916 --> 01:04:45.791
You know? Some people think
I work for Mother Nature,

01:04:45.791 --> 01:04:47.250
or Father Time,

01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:49.750
and recently everybody thinks
I work for Beyoncé.

01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:52.083
But no, every married man
would understand this.

01:04:52.083 --> 01:04:53.500
I work for Mrs. Claus.

01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:56.708
Mrs. Claus is running everything,
whatever she tells me to do,

01:04:56.708 --> 01:04:58.958
that is what I do.

01:04:58.958 --> 01:05:00.833
<i>As soon as I get out of this event,</i>

01:05:00.833 --> 01:05:03.208

01:05:03.208 --> 01:05:06.916
<i>and I'm not going to lie,
it will be painful for you.</i>

01:05:07.291 --> 01:05:08.416
<i>- Mary?
- </i>  Yes, sir.

01:05:08.416 --> 01:05:10.666
<i>I'll meet you at the place
next to the thing</i>

01:05:10.666 --> 01:05:12.750
<i>and we will get
this information out of him.</i>

01:05:12.750 --> 01:05:14.250
Copy that, boss.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.375
- Let's get this over with.

01:05:18.375 --> 01:05:21.875
It's probably the boss to clear up
where the place by the thing is.

01:05:21.875 --> 01:05:24.250
- Good, 'cause I had no idea.
- Yeah, boss?

01:05:36.916 --> 01:05:37.916
Nick!

01:05:37.916 --> 01:05:39.666
Go get him!

01:05:39.791 --> 01:05:41.375
Hey, Eddie, how you doing?

01:05:43.541 --> 01:05:45.333
What is going on in there?

01:05:45.333 --> 01:05:48.083
Guess they heard
one too many Christmas songs.

01:05:50.416 --> 01:05:52.750
Looks like it's wearing off now,
let's get out of here.

01:05:52.750 --> 01:05:54.500
Claus! Right there.

01:05:55.166 --> 01:05:56.208
Get him!

01:06:00.250 --> 01:06:01.416
Madam Mayor.

01:06:01.833 --> 01:06:03.250
What a lovely party.

01:06:03.250 --> 01:06:05.750
Thank you so much, Conrad,
that's so nice of you.

01:06:06.250 --> 01:06:07.416
Now, what do you want?

01:06:07.416 --> 01:06:09.208
What're you doing here?

01:06:09.208 --> 01:06:11.583
- I came here for you.
- What do you mean you...

01:06:11.583 --> 01:06:14.041
- Did the Truckles track me here?
- Yeah, they did.

01:06:14.041 --> 01:06:16.125
You know what? I love that family.

01:06:16.125 --> 01:06:18.791
Look, there's one more thing
I gotta tell you, but...

01:06:18.791 --> 01:06:20.875
Let's just get out of here.
I'll tell you later.

01:06:20.875 --> 01:06:22.166
They can't guard him

01:06:22.166 --> 01:06:23.916
and I'm the loud soccer mom.

01:06:23.916 --> 01:06:26.958
I'm sorry, excuse me,
Madam Mayor, just a moment.

01:06:32.416 --> 01:06:33.416
They got away.

01:06:33.416 --> 01:06:36.375
You know, those bad guys
are after my naughty and nice list.

01:06:36.375 --> 01:06:38.125
- Oh, macaroons.
- Yes, I know.

01:06:38.125 --> 01:06:41.083
Harf is a congressman
on the House of Appropriations Committee.

01:06:41.083 --> 01:06:43.166
He's been accepting bribes
and he's basically using it

01:06:43.166 --> 01:06:44.666
like his own private piggy bank.

01:06:44.666 --> 01:06:46.208
Those are a lot of words.

01:06:48.291 --> 01:06:49.875
Come on, come on, man.

01:06:50.791 --> 01:06:52.250
So, the tablet that you took

01:06:52.250 --> 01:06:55.125
contains a list of all the pay-offs
he intends to collect tonight.

01:06:55.125 --> 01:06:56.500
You believe that, Eddie?

01:07:11.083 --> 01:07:12.375
Stop!

01:07:16.458 --> 01:07:19.708
- You okay, boss? You look tired.

01:07:22.541 --> 01:07:23.750
Where's my tablet?

01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:25.833
Like I said, I don't know.

01:07:25.833 --> 01:07:31.750
Look, Santa,
I have no problem destroying this...

01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:34.083
for every kid in America.

01:07:34.083 --> 01:07:35.625
Oh, sorry.

01:07:36.541 --> 01:07:38.750
He thinks I'm just local, no, I'm...

01:07:38.750 --> 01:07:40.750
I'm global.

01:07:40.750 --> 01:07:42.166
Okay.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.708
- What about you?
- What about me?

01:07:44.708 --> 01:07:46.916
What's your involvement in all of this?

01:07:46.916 --> 01:07:49.083
I'm just Santa's helper, that's it.

01:07:50.166 --> 01:07:51.833
Eddie, did you just say...

01:07:52.708 --> 01:07:55.166
- Did you just say that out loud?
- Don't do that.

01:07:55.166 --> 01:07:57.000
That you're Santa's helper.

01:07:57.750 --> 01:08:00.083
- You've come such a long way, Eddie.
- Don't...

01:08:00.083 --> 01:08:01.500
Y'all heard that!

01:08:02.208 --> 01:08:04.250
He said he's Santa's helper!

01:08:04.250 --> 01:08:06.208
- Alright.
- That is partnership!

01:08:06.208 --> 01:08:07.958
Okay, okay, alright, alright.

01:08:07.958 --> 01:08:09.250
Okay, don't go too far.

01:08:09.250 --> 01:08:11.791
-  Calm down.
- What is happening here?

01:08:12.250 --> 01:08:14.041
How can these two rob us,

01:08:14.041 --> 01:08:16.166
outfox us, outrun us?

01:08:16.166 --> 01:08:17.541
These two!

01:08:17.541 --> 01:08:19.916
Man, you are not Santa Claus.

01:08:19.916 --> 01:08:22.625
And you, you're not whoever it is
you think you are.

01:08:22.625 --> 01:08:24.541
Why you messin' with me?
I didn't do anything.

01:08:24.541 --> 01:08:27.375
Take them to the spot
and use everything we learned

01:08:27.375 --> 01:08:29.500
on Google on how to extract information

01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:32.083
from those who don't want
information extracted from them.

01:08:32.083 --> 01:08:33.458
Yes, Conrad Harf!

01:08:34.916 --> 01:08:38.708
When you were nine years old,
you wanted the Action Arthur ninja doll.

01:08:38.708 --> 01:08:41.083
With the kung fu grip...
Yes you did, yes you did.

01:08:41.083 --> 01:08:43.750
- Yes you did.
- I don't know what you're talking...

01:08:43.750 --> 01:08:45.000
about.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.500
It had the little button in the back
and the foot and the arm would come up.

01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:51.291
The right foot and the left hand
and it would do a karate thing.

01:08:51.291 --> 01:08:53.625
But you wanted it.
It was tricky, we couldn't get it

01:08:53.625 --> 01:08:56.208
because the gingerbread men
decided to go on a strike.

01:08:56.208 --> 01:08:59.875
I know you really wanted that action doll
and I'm sorry I couldn't get it for you.

01:08:59.875 --> 01:09:01.500
But it all makes sense now

01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:05.583
which is why you probably got this weird
origin villain story right now.

01:09:05.583 --> 01:09:06.958
Shut up!

01:09:08.875 --> 01:09:11.250
You guys take care of this.

01:09:13.125 --> 01:09:14.166
I got it.

01:09:18.875 --> 01:09:20.166
Give me this.

01:09:24.375 --> 01:09:26.708
Very good.

01:09:27.541 --> 01:09:29.958
-  Now...
- Eddie, you gotta believe.

01:09:30.666 --> 01:09:35.083
- Believe and magic happens.
- What shall we do about these two?

01:09:35.083 --> 01:09:38.541
- What is that?
- Little known Santa fact number four.

01:09:38.541 --> 01:09:40.583
Reindeer can do more than just fly.

01:09:40.583 --> 01:09:43.916
They're great at gift wrapping,
making pasta from scratch,

01:09:43.916 --> 01:09:47.541
and protecting Santa
against anybody that messes with him.

01:10:01.833 --> 01:10:04.083
Eddie, open your eyes.

01:10:38.458 --> 01:10:40.666
Man, where have they been all night?

01:10:41.041 --> 01:10:43.458
They've just been circling the sky
waiting on you.

01:10:43.458 --> 01:10:45.208
Just waiting on you to have faith.

01:11:20.708 --> 01:11:23.833

01:12:26.083 --> 01:12:27.583
Mommy!

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.750
- You see the reindeer?
- Yeah!

01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:41.416
- You wanna go pet them?
- Mm-hmm.

01:12:43.750 --> 01:12:44.750
Hi!

01:12:44.750 --> 01:12:46.375
You're so fluffy.

01:12:46.833 --> 01:12:48.250
Good job.

01:12:48.250 --> 01:12:51.166
I missed you so much,
great job tonight, ladies.

01:12:52.416 --> 01:12:54.791
Alright,
let's get out of here.

01:12:54.791 --> 01:12:55.875
Hey, Nick.

01:12:56.791 --> 01:12:59.041
- You're forgetting something.

01:13:00.083 --> 01:13:02.125
Can't forget this.

01:13:02.125 --> 01:13:03.541
Thank you.

01:13:04.416 --> 01:13:05.416
Hey.

01:13:08.791 --> 01:13:12.375
You know, this whole time you've been
trying to get me to believe in you.

01:13:14.291 --> 01:13:15.875
I want you to know that

01:13:16.625 --> 01:13:19.708
I wouldn't have got there
if you didn't believe in me first.

01:13:19.708 --> 01:13:23.333
Look, Eddie, I would love
to take the credit for this, but...

01:13:24.750 --> 01:13:26.875
It wasn't about me believing in you.

01:13:26.875 --> 01:13:30.250
You know who truly believed in you
to make all this happen?

01:13:30.250 --> 01:13:32.791
That amazing little girl
right over there.

01:13:35.791 --> 01:13:37.375
Can you smile for me?

01:13:38.916 --> 01:13:40.291
Hi!

01:13:40.291 --> 01:13:43.041
So, are these your brothers
or your sisters, or... ?

01:13:43.041 --> 01:13:44.416
Look, Eddie,

01:13:44.958 --> 01:13:48.041
all I wanna do
is have you start believing again.

01:13:48.708 --> 01:13:50.666
<i>Like you once did, you know?</i>

01:13:51.583 --> 01:13:53.041
<i>When eight-year-old Eddie</i>

01:13:54.458 --> 01:13:58.416
<i>thought that a fishing rod
would solve all of his problems.</i>

01:14:02.375 --> 01:14:04.625
You know,
things aren't so bad, Nick.

01:14:05.083 --> 01:14:06.500
Things aren't so bad at all.

01:14:14.166 --> 01:14:15.291
Oh, before I forget.

01:14:15.291 --> 01:14:17.125
Could you give this to Harf for me?

01:14:18.375 --> 01:14:21.208
- Got it.
- Tell him it's from Santa.

01:14:32.208 --> 01:14:33.416
Bye, Nick!

01:14:34.875 --> 01:14:38.125
You really pulled out all the stops
this year, Madam Mayor.

01:14:46.833 --> 01:14:48.375
He's on the move!

01:14:52.666 --> 01:14:55.000
So, my dad pressed
the reindeer clicker, right?

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:56.416
And that called the reindeer.

01:14:56.416 --> 01:14:59.000
Are you getting this?
Should I start over?

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.916
Everything you need to know
about the crooked congressman

01:15:01.916 --> 01:15:04.791
and his three stooges
is on there, alright?

01:15:04.791 --> 01:15:07.333
Harf, before you go...

01:15:07.333 --> 01:15:09.791
- He wanted you to have this.
- What is it?

01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:12.916
- Guess you gotta open it and see.

01:15:15.541 --> 01:15:17.583
No... No...

01:15:17.583 --> 01:15:20.500
Action Arthur! Action Arthur!

01:15:21.458 --> 01:15:22.958
I'm a good boy now!

01:15:22.958 --> 01:15:25.625
- Hi-yah! Hi-yah!
- Yeah, okay...

01:15:25.625 --> 01:15:28.125
- Get him in.
- Action Arthur, officer!

01:15:28.125 --> 01:15:30.166
Action Arthur.

01:15:30.166 --> 01:15:32.208
Maybe he really was Santa.

01:15:32.208 --> 01:15:34.375
I told you the entire time.

01:15:34.375 --> 01:15:36.500
He's magic!

01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:38.375
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:15:39.583 --> 01:15:43.333
Aren't you guys a little old
to be believing in Santa Claus?

01:15:43.333 --> 01:15:45.083
I'm 42.

01:15:51.541 --> 01:15:54.875
Hello? Nick! You okay?

01:15:56.583 --> 01:15:57.958
You got it, brother.

01:15:59.875 --> 01:16:02.333
We are back, people! We are back!

01:16:06.458 --> 01:16:08.291
Merry Christmas!

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.958
One, two, three...
We saved Christmas!

01:16:12.666 --> 01:16:13.958
Alright, let's roll.

01:16:13.958 --> 01:16:15.458
Time to keep on trucking.

01:16:33.458 --> 01:16:35.625
It's okay, Dad, you'll do great.

01:16:44.541 --> 01:16:46.000
Are you okay? Oh!

01:16:46.625 --> 01:16:50.000
- I'm fine, we had the best night.
- Where were you?

01:16:50.458 --> 01:16:53.708
I know you're not gonna believe me,
but we were with Santa Claus.

01:16:53.708 --> 01:16:56.916
Okay, you know what, Eddie?
Now is not the time to mess with me.

01:16:56.916 --> 01:16:59.500
No, no, baby, we were.
We were with Santa Claus.

01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:02.208
I promise. Charlotte,
you gonna leave me out to dry?

01:17:02.208 --> 01:17:05.000
- Back me up.
- Mom, Dad's telling the truth.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.083
We were!

01:17:06.083 --> 01:17:08.125
Now you've enlisted
our 8-year-old daughter

01:17:08.125 --> 01:17:09.666
to go along with your shenanigans?

01:17:09.666 --> 01:17:11.916
No, I would never do that,
I'm telling you.

01:17:11.916 --> 01:17:14.000
Just listen for a second.

01:17:16.250 --> 01:17:17.250
What was that?

01:17:21.416 --> 01:17:22.791
What are y'all looking at?

01:17:26.666 --> 01:17:28.375
What are you doing here?

01:17:28.375 --> 01:17:32.583
See, I knew your story wouldn't fly,
so, I decided to help you out a bit.

01:17:32.583 --> 01:17:34.958
Yeah, it crashed right into the ocean.

01:17:34.958 --> 01:17:36.916
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:17:36.916 --> 01:17:39.333
You're the Santa Claus...

01:17:39.333 --> 01:17:41.958
Yes, I am The Santa Claus.

01:17:42.750 --> 01:17:44.916
Okay, well...

01:17:44.916 --> 01:17:47.083
What's up with the hombre beard?

01:17:47.083 --> 01:17:50.291
He dyed it because of his midlife crisis.

01:17:51.083 --> 01:17:53.625
You, you...
This is all quite unbelievable.

01:17:53.625 --> 01:17:55.750
You know what's unbelievable?

01:17:56.291 --> 01:17:58.916
The look on your seven-year-old face

01:17:58.916 --> 01:18:03.208
when you got
your Mr. and Mrs. Seahorse family playset.

01:18:03.958 --> 01:18:06.208
You were so excited to have that.

01:18:06.208 --> 01:18:08.625
You didn't think
you'd get a gift that year because...

01:18:08.625 --> 01:18:10.750
My dad had lost his job.

01:18:12.416 --> 01:18:14.833
I don't remember telling you about that.

01:18:14.833 --> 01:18:16.708
You didn't, that's what I'm saying.

01:18:16.708 --> 01:18:18.916
This is what I've been
dealing with all night.

01:18:19.625 --> 01:18:21.541
Okay, goodnight.

01:18:21.541 --> 01:18:23.458
Wait, don't leave just yet.

01:18:23.458 --> 01:18:26.875
Eddie here has something
he wants to tell you.

01:18:26.875 --> 01:18:30.166
- I do?
-  He knows what you are thinking.

01:18:30.166 --> 01:18:32.708
I know what you're thinking,
so you gonna say it.

01:18:32.708 --> 01:18:33.791
You gonna say it.

01:18:33.791 --> 01:18:35.375
- Yes, I do, I do.
- He does.

01:18:35.375 --> 01:18:38.583
- There you go, go ahead, do your thing.
- I... I'm going.

01:18:38.583 --> 01:18:40.708
Okay, gimme some space.

01:18:40.708 --> 01:18:41.916
Okay.

01:18:45.041 --> 01:18:46.750
- Allison...
- Allison...

01:18:48.166 --> 01:18:49.541
You know something?

01:18:50.333 --> 01:18:51.458
I'll be over here.

01:18:55.125 --> 01:18:58.041
Allison, I think I've always been afraid.

01:18:58.041 --> 01:19:01.958
Ever since I was eight years old,
I've been terrified

01:19:01.958 --> 01:19:04.625
because on Christmas,
my parents split up.

01:19:05.125 --> 01:19:08.416
So, when Charlotte turned eight,
it just all came flooding back.

01:19:08.916 --> 01:19:11.791
And I figured it's safer to,
as you say, detach.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.208
But that's not being safe, I know.

01:19:15.708 --> 01:19:17.208
That's just being afraid.

01:19:19.083 --> 01:19:22.041
Now I realize
none of that makes any sense.

01:19:22.458 --> 01:19:25.875
Not when you have something
that you really believe in.

01:19:26.416 --> 01:19:29.208
And for me, that's you.

01:19:31.916 --> 01:19:33.791
And my beautiful daughter, Charlotte.

01:19:36.541 --> 01:19:38.583
I guess what I'm trying to say is that

01:19:39.125 --> 01:19:41.041
you two are my Christmas.

01:19:42.416 --> 01:19:43.708
Every day of the year.

01:19:44.541 --> 01:19:45.750
And I love you.

01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:51.458
It took your buddy, Santa,
to help you figure out all of this?

01:19:52.208 --> 01:19:55.375
He did a little bit, yes.
I'll give him a little credit.

01:19:56.208 --> 01:19:58.708
Man, you gonna make me cry.

01:20:03.458 --> 01:20:04.791
So, what did you think?

01:20:05.708 --> 01:20:06.916
About what I said?

01:20:10.333 --> 01:20:11.333
I think...

01:20:13.833 --> 01:20:15.666
- It was alright.
-  What?

01:20:16.333 --> 01:20:18.708
I think I like it.

01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:26.125
Santa, why is your bag moving?

01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:30.000
I'm glad you asked.
I got a surprise for you.

01:20:30.958 --> 01:20:33.541
Say hello to Bulldozer.

01:20:35.750 --> 01:20:36.958
No.

01:20:36.958 --> 01:20:38.375
No, no, no.

01:20:38.375 --> 01:20:40.083
Hello, Bulldozer.

01:20:40.083 --> 01:20:42.083
No, no, we do not need a dog, okay?

01:20:42.083 --> 01:20:43.500
Yes we do.

01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:45.250
We need a dog.

01:20:47.250 --> 01:20:50.250
If I'd known 30 years ago,
we could've saved your dad...

01:20:50.250 --> 01:20:52.416
I'm so glad you agree, baby.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.041
Charlotte, look.

01:21:00.208 --> 01:21:01.833
Christmas magic.

01:21:02.708 --> 01:21:04.041
You're the man, Santa.

01:21:10.791 --> 01:21:13.291
Look at this big boy.

01:21:13.833 --> 01:21:15.041
My work here is done.

01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:19.625
Thank you.

01:21:24.458 --> 01:21:25.750
Alright, Garricks.

01:21:27.125 --> 01:21:28.416
Have a Merry Christmas.

01:21:31.708 --> 01:21:32.750
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:42.125
Are we expecting someone else?

01:21:45.458 --> 01:21:48.583
Hey, guys, you wanna come in
and meet Bulldozer?

01:21:49.083 --> 01:21:51.208
-  Absolutely.
-  Absolutely.

01:21:51.208 --> 01:21:52.625
Look, oh my...

01:21:55.208 --> 01:21:58.291
Alright, ladies,
we got a long night to go.

01:21:58.291 --> 01:22:00.583
And a lot of catching up to do.

01:22:16.083 --> 01:22:17.166
Santa!

01:22:21.458 --> 01:22:22.458
Bye, Santa!
