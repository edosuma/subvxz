00:05.605 --> 00:06.873
Are you worried?

00:06.939 --> 00:08.074
If I wasn't worried,
would I be drinking water

00:08.141 --> 00:09.542
{\an8}with this expression
on my face?

00:13.213 --> 00:14.414

One we like to call...

00:38.004 --> 00:40.407
{\an8}"Who's that weirdo
in my neighborhood?"

00:44.844 --> 00:45.812
You see, Freddie...

00:45.879 --> 00:46.813
Our technical weenie...

00:46.880 --> 00:48.348
Producer!

00:48.415 --> 00:49.849
He mounts
a secret little camera

00:49.916 --> 00:51.217
right outside this building...

00:51.284 --> 00:53.153
Then aims it at the bus stop
across the street.

00:53.219 --> 00:55.555
And this week, we found
the biggest weirdo yet.

00:55.622 --> 00:56.589
Go, Freddie.

00:56.656 --> 00:57.991
Playback.

00:58.958 --> 01:01.928
There he is, peeling a banana
while he waits for the bus.

01:01.995 --> 01:03.797
Now, you think he's gonna
eat the banana, right?

01:03.863 --> 01:05.063
Well, think again!

01:06.733 --> 01:07.967
Yep, there he goes.

01:08.034 --> 01:09.202
Chewin' the peel.
What a freak.

01:10.970 --> 01:12.272
And that's why
the new champion of...

01:12.338 --> 01:14.507

03:06.185 --> 03:07.954
Hey, little sister
and her two friends...

03:08.021 --> 03:09.522
Who never seem to hang out
at their own homes?

03:10.590 --> 03:11.791
What's you cooking there,
handsome?

Everything.

03:13.259 --> 03:14.727
my friend Socko's having
a birthday party Next week,

03:14.794 --> 03:19.499
and I'm in charge of all things

03:19.566 --> 03:20.533
[doorbell chimes]
I'll get it.

03:20.600 --> 03:21.935
Freddie, hold these egg yolks.

03:22.001 --> 03:23.002
But...no, no, wait!

03:29.275 --> 03:30.610
-Hi.
-Hi.

03:30.677 --> 03:32.679
I'm detective Tragg,
Seattle police department.

03:32.745 --> 03:33.846
Freddie, take my backpack.

03:36.215 --> 03:37.317
Uh, what can I do for ya?

03:37.383 --> 03:38.551
I'd like to talk with the kids.

03:38.618 --> 03:39.919
You can't prove anything!

03:42.288 --> 03:43.623
Relax.

03:43.690 --> 03:45.725
you guys aren't in
any kind of trouble, okay?

03:45.792 --> 03:48.061
My daughter's a big fan
of your webshow, iCarly.

03:48.127 --> 03:49.395
Oh!

03:49.462 --> 03:50.463
I was watching the show
with her last night,

03:50.530 --> 03:51.631
And we noticed a man,

03:51.698 --> 03:52.966
a suspect
we've been trying to catch.

03:53.032 --> 03:53.967
Crazy fruit dude?

03:55.301 --> 03:56.436
No, we're actually after a guy

03:56.502 --> 03:59.138
who walked
behind Crazy fruit dude...

03:59.205 --> 04:01.507
Into that convenience store
across the street.

04:01.574 --> 04:02.742
You guys record
all of your web shows?

04:02.809 --> 04:04.777
Yeah.
Everything's archived.

04:04.844 --> 04:06.112
Do you want me to bring you
and mpeg of it?

04:06.179 --> 04:07.947
-What's an mpeg?
-It's a computer video file.

04:08.014 --> 04:08.982
Yeah.

04:09.048 --> 04:10.116
mpeg stands for

04:10.183 --> 04:11.951
"mega-pixel
electronic gallery."

04:12.018 --> 04:13.353
Wrong!

04:13.419 --> 04:15.588
mpeg stands for
"moving picture experts group."

04:15.655 --> 04:17.624
"mega-pixel
electronic gallery."

04:17.690 --> 04:19.591
Moving picture
experts group."

04:19.659 --> 04:20.793
Can't we just say
mpeg stands for

04:20.860 --> 04:22.060
"most pimples enjoy gravy"

04:22.128 --> 04:23.096
and move on?

04:24.464 --> 04:25.398
May I look out your window?

04:25.465 --> 04:26.799
I was hoping you'd ask.

04:28.234 --> 04:29.869
Sorry, but I'm right.

04:29.936 --> 04:31.738
-Sam, stop it.
-You wanna bet?

04:31.804 --> 04:33.539
-No, she doesn't.
-Yeah, I wanna bet.

04:33.606 --> 04:34.807
How come I can hear me?

04:36.342 --> 04:38.511
Okay, it's a bet.

04:38.578 --> 04:40.780
And...

04:40.847 --> 04:44.984
loser has to get a tattoo
of the winner's face.

04:45.051 --> 04:46.686
Oh, you're on!

04:47.987 --> 04:49.322
But you're gonna
be pretty upset

04:49.389 --> 04:51.858
When you have to get
a tattoo of my face on you.

04:54.227 --> 04:56.162
You're right. I lost.

04:58.064 --> 05:01.634
And now, my face will forever
become a part of your skin.

05:04.637 --> 05:05.605
Yeah,
this window has a good view

05:05.672 --> 05:07.240
of that convenience store.

05:07.306 --> 05:08.641
You know, my partner and I
would like to set up

05:08.708 --> 05:10.343
a stakeout Here for a few days.

05:10.410 --> 05:12.545
Oh, iCarly helps
catch a criminal.

05:12.612 --> 05:13.680
Uh, sure.

05:13.746 --> 05:15.014
who are you guys
trying to catch?

05:15.081 --> 05:16.949
The clerk
in that convenience store.

05:17.016 --> 05:19.652
We have knowledge
that he's selling pirated DVDs

05:19.719 --> 05:21.688
Illegal copies of hit movies.

05:21.754 --> 05:23.322
Tragg! This is Stimbler!

05:23.389 --> 05:25.425
Which apartment is it?

05:25.491 --> 05:27.093
Hey, Stu, I'm in 8-c.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.394
My partner.

05:28.461 --> 05:30.129
Wait, wait.

05:30.196 --> 05:33.266
Your partner's name
is Stu Stimbler?

05:33.332 --> 05:35.134
Detective Stuart Stimbler.
I'll go get him.

05:35.201 --> 05:36.269
Oh!

05:38.337 --> 05:39.272
Oh, no.

05:40.373 --> 05:41.808
What's wrong?

05:41.874 --> 05:44.410
I went to sleep-away camp
with a kid named Stu Stimbler.

05:44.477 --> 05:45.812
He was the meanest,

05:45.878 --> 05:47.814
most obnoxious bully
in my whole cabin.

05:47.880 --> 05:49.916
His nickname was
"spanky."

05:49.982 --> 05:51.350
Well, it's probably
not the same guy.

05:51.417 --> 05:52.585
Yeah.

05:52.652 --> 05:53.920
what are the odds
that it would be...

05:55.054 --> 05:57.090
Oh! Spencer!

05:57.156 --> 05:58.891
Oh, no!

05:58.958 --> 06:01.160
It's me, Spanky Stimbler!

06:01.227 --> 06:02.829
-I see you!
-Ha!

06:02.895 --> 06:04.230
Why do they call him Spanky?

06:04.297 --> 06:06.032
I'll show you why.

06:06.099 --> 06:08.267
-No. No, no, no, no!
-Spence!

06:08.334 --> 06:09.902
-Come on!
- No!

06:09.969 --> 06:12.405
-Quit it!
-Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

06:12.472 --> 06:13.639
Thanks for asking!

06:18.244 --> 06:20.313
Okay, I don't see
any criminal activity,

06:20.379 --> 06:21.447
But I do see a jogger

06:21.514 --> 06:22.982
who really
should be wearing a bra.

06:24.250 --> 06:25.218
Poor guy.

06:27.620 --> 06:29.322
"Moving picture experts group"!

06:30.957 --> 06:32.225
Do you really think

06:32.291 --> 06:34.327
Sam's gonna make me
get a tattoo of her face?

06:34.393 --> 06:36.963
I don't know, but if she does,
won't your mom freak?

06:37.029 --> 06:39.565
She freaked when I spilled
one tiny drop of mustard

06:39.632 --> 06:40.733
On my church pants.

06:41.701 --> 06:43.169
What?
"Church pants."

06:48.574 --> 06:49.909
What up, party people?

06:49.976 --> 06:52.011
Say hello to my cousin, Annie.

06:52.078 --> 06:53.112
Hi.

06:53.179 --> 06:54.313
I thought you said
she was in jail.

06:54.380 --> 06:56.015
Oh, parole, baby.

06:58.351 --> 07:00.186
Ready, Freddie?

07:00.253 --> 07:01.721
Ready for what?

07:01.788 --> 07:03.389
Annie's a tattoo artist.

07:11.531 --> 07:13.166
You made a bet and you lost.

07:13.232 --> 07:14.300
Right, Carly?

07:14.367 --> 07:15.601
I want no part of this.

07:15.668 --> 07:17.103
I'm just gonna watch
the bouncy jogger man.

07:19.205 --> 07:20.773
Sam, please!

07:20.840 --> 07:22.542
I'll do anything else.

07:22.608 --> 07:24.343
The deal was you get a tattoo.

07:24.410 --> 07:25.678
-I know, but...
-Sit.

07:26.712 --> 07:28.080
Sam!

07:28.147 --> 07:30.483
Quit whining, kid.
Getting a tattoo ain't so bad.

07:30.550 --> 07:31.951
-It's not?
-No.

07:32.018 --> 07:34.020
It just hurts a lot
and lasts forever.

07:40.159 --> 07:41.060
Oh, my God!

07:41.127 --> 07:42.728
Now he's doing jumping jacks!

07:54.774 --> 07:56.242
Oh!

07:57.076 --> 08:00.346
Please, don't spank me
with my own cucumber!

08:01.614 --> 08:02.782
You...

08:04.617 --> 08:05.952
Oh!

08:06.018 --> 08:07.720
Tragg, they got peppy-cola!

08:07.787 --> 08:08.855
Those are Carly's.
You shouldn't take...

08:08.921 --> 08:10.823
Hey, yo, grab me one,
would you?

08:24.871 --> 08:27.306
Sam, in tattoo form!

08:28.808 --> 08:30.877
So awful.

08:30.943 --> 08:32.678
How are you hiding that
from your mom?

08:32.745 --> 08:33.946
It's not easy.
Yeah.

08:34.013 --> 08:35.047
Doesn't she still give you

08:35.114 --> 08:36.948
those bi-weekly
Body inspections?

08:38.116 --> 08:39.418
No!

08:39.485 --> 08:41.554
I told her I was too old
for those a long time ago.

08:41.621 --> 08:42.755
-Yesterday?
-Maybe.

08:44.256 --> 08:46.759
Hey.

08:46.826 --> 08:47.760
I had a pork pot pie
in your fridge

08:47.827 --> 08:49.061
from last weekend

08:49.128 --> 08:50.229
And one of those cops
downstairs ate it.

08:52.198 --> 08:53.799
Well, they drank my peppy-cola.

08:53.866 --> 08:55.101
-They did?
-Do I seem peppy?

08:55.167 --> 08:56.269
-Not really.
-Well.

08:58.838 --> 08:59.972
How much longer
Are they gonna be here?

09:00.039 --> 09:01.407
-It's been like days.
-I know.

09:01.474 --> 09:03.009
They haven't gotten
any good evidence

09:03.075 --> 09:05.578
on the guy They thinks'
selling those pirated DVDs.

09:05.645 --> 09:06.812
Okay, guys, 10 seconds.

09:06.879 --> 09:08.014
Showtime, kid.

09:08.080 --> 09:12.184
In five, four, three, two...

09:12.251 --> 09:15.621
Hello.

A cop ate it!

09:24.196 --> 09:25.064
Okay.

Now, if you've ever wondered

Um...

09:30.069 --> 09:31.337
What are you guys doing?

09:31.404 --> 09:33.072
We got suspicious activity
across the street.

09:33.139 --> 09:34.440
The view
from the downstairs window

09:34.507 --> 09:35.841
got blocked by a truck.

09:35.908 --> 09:37.243
Okay, iCarly fans,

09:37.310 --> 09:38.110
This may look like
we're Trying to do a comedy...

09:38.177 --> 09:39.478
Shut that camera down!

09:39.545 --> 09:40.613
We got a police investigation
going on here.

09:40.680 --> 09:42.014
-Turn that off.
-Yeah?

09:42.081 --> 09:43.382
Well, maybe you should shut
your investigation down.

09:43.449 --> 09:45.351
-We got a web show here.
-Not right now, you don't.

09:45.418 --> 09:46.919
-Turn off the camera.
-No, no, no, no, no!

09:54.593 --> 09:55.928
Somebody call a congressman!

09:55.995 --> 09:57.430
-I am starving!
-Hey!

09:57.496 --> 09:58.431
Turn that off!

10:02.969 --> 10:04.203
Stupid cops,

10:04.270 --> 10:06.072
not cleaning up
after themselves,

10:06.138 --> 10:08.574
Interrupting our web show,
Making me grumble to myself.

10:10.543 --> 10:12.578
Some people
just have no manners.

10:17.383 --> 10:19.318
Any idea when the cops
are gonna arrest that guy

10:19.385 --> 10:20.653
and leave?

10:20.720 --> 10:22.888
No, but it better be soon,
Cause I've had it.

10:22.955 --> 10:24.857
-You think you've had it?
-Yes, I know I've had it.

10:25.791 --> 10:27.326
Me, too!

10:27.393 --> 10:29.762
I thought I was rid Of that
jerky Stu Stimbler years ago.

10:29.829 --> 10:31.797
He ruined camp for me!

10:31.864 --> 10:32.932
Do you know what it's like

10:32.999 --> 10:35.267
To be harassed every day
by some kid?

10:39.905 --> 10:41.307
Where are those cops anyway?

10:41.374 --> 10:43.342
They've been upstairs all day.

10:43.409 --> 10:44.877
Whoa, Spencer.

10:44.944 --> 10:46.512
-Did you make this cake?
-Yeah.

10:46.579 --> 10:47.880
It's for Socko.

10:47.947 --> 10:49.648
See, since he owns
his own sock company,

10:49.715 --> 10:54.020
I made his birthday cake
in the shape of a sock.

10:54.086 --> 10:55.421
This is incredible.

10:55.488 --> 10:56.622
How'd you do this?

10:56.689 --> 10:58.557
I just combined
my sculpting skills

10:58.624 --> 10:59.925
with my cakery skills,

10:59.992 --> 11:01.961
And, boom, sock cake.
Shall we applaud?

11:06.098 --> 11:07.133
May I come in?

11:07.199 --> 11:08.300
Whoops, already in.

11:08.367 --> 11:10.403
Freddie, come on.
It's time for our class.

11:10.469 --> 11:12.705
Spencer,
you have a stain on your shirt.

11:12.772 --> 11:14.440
Go put on a fresh one.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.575
-But you're not my mother.
-Mm!

11:16.642 --> 11:17.510
I'll put on a clean shirt.

11:19.979 --> 11:22.515
-Man, I totally forgot.
-What?

11:22.581 --> 11:23.816
My mom signed us up

11:23.883 --> 11:25.351
for mother-son synchronized
swimming classes.

11:27.620 --> 11:29.155
Stop laughing!

11:29.221 --> 11:30.689
When I take off my shirt
to get in the pool,

11:30.756 --> 11:32.258
She's gonna see my tattoo.

11:32.324 --> 11:33.392
I'm dead.

11:33.459 --> 11:34.460
Freddie?

11:35.928 --> 11:38.230
Mom, I don't have a swimsuit.

11:38.297 --> 11:39.832
Which is why
I just stopped at mall-mart

11:39.899 --> 11:41.000
And bought you this.

11:47.373 --> 11:49.241
-Look, mom...
-Let's go.

11:54.513 --> 11:55.514
Have fun.

11:55.581 --> 11:57.016
Swimming simultaneously.

12:00.052 --> 12:01.854
Dad, I'm bored!

12:01.921 --> 12:03.589
What am I supposed to do?

12:03.656 --> 12:05.491
You think I'm irritating!

12:06.559 --> 12:09.028
I have never said that
out loud.

12:11.063 --> 12:12.998
Uh, why do you guys
have a child with you?

12:13.065 --> 12:14.233
That's his son.

12:15.267 --> 12:17.036
This bottle's empty.

12:21.006 --> 12:23.309
His nanny
had a nervous breakdown.

12:25.444 --> 12:26.512
Go in the kitchen

12:26.579 --> 12:28.814
and get yourself
a can of peppy-cola.

12:28.881 --> 12:29.949
-Did you buy more?
-Yes.

12:30.015 --> 12:31.884
-Okay, go.
-Yeah, go ahead.

12:31.951 --> 12:33.986
Okay...oh, boy!

12:35.621 --> 12:38.023
So have you geniuses
gotten your evidence yet?

12:38.090 --> 12:39.325
You know, so you can leave?

12:39.391 --> 12:40.593
Not yet.

12:40.659 --> 12:42.661
This stakeout could take
two or three more weeks.

12:42.728 --> 12:44.230
-What?
-Weeks?

12:44.296 --> 12:45.664
Why can't you
just go across the street

12:45.731 --> 12:47.166
and arrest the guy right now?

12:47.233 --> 12:48.501
Cause we don't have proof yet

12:48.567 --> 12:50.302
that he's selling
the illegal DVDs.

12:51.871 --> 12:53.339
Hey, did Mrs. Benson leave?

12:53.405 --> 12:54.573
Yeah.

12:54.640 --> 12:56.008
Why'd she tell me to
go put on a new...

13:03.782 --> 13:04.850
Spencer.

13:04.917 --> 13:06.252
You ate my sock cake.

13:06.318 --> 13:08.587
What's this big spoon for?

13:08.654 --> 13:10.222
You ate my sock cake.

13:10.289 --> 13:12.625
Why would you eat my sock cake?
I don't even Know who you are.

13:12.691 --> 13:13.692
How could you...oh!

13:16.128 --> 13:18.397
You're out of peppy-cola.

13:32.578 --> 13:34.079
Okay,
you're not gonna believe this.

13:34.146 --> 13:35.948
Those cops have gone too far.

13:36.015 --> 13:37.149
Spanky let his obnoxious kid

13:37.216 --> 13:39.051
Use my pear-pod
without asking me.

13:39.118 --> 13:40.186
-No way.
-Yes.

13:40.252 --> 13:41.554
He erased half my songs

13:41.620 --> 13:43.289
And left it covered
in little boy spit.

13:46.091 --> 13:47.493
Hey, Freddie.

13:47.560 --> 13:48.894
What happened in your
synchronized swimming class?

13:48.961 --> 13:50.796
-Did your mom see your tattoo?
-No.

13:50.863 --> 13:52.565
I kept my shirt on
the whole time.

13:52.631 --> 13:54.733
I told her I was afraid
of getting a cloud burn.

13:56.168 --> 13:57.903
-"Cloud burn," good one.
-Yeah.

13:57.970 --> 13:59.939
Till she drove me
to seven different drugstores

14:00.005 --> 14:01.006
Looking for cloud block.

14:02.541 --> 14:05.044
You guys, help me get rid
of those annoying cops.

14:05.110 --> 14:06.579
Why's it taking so long?

14:06.645 --> 14:07.947
They say
they need solid evidence

14:08.013 --> 14:10.549
that the guy's Selling
pirated DVDs.

14:10.616 --> 14:11.717
I bet we could get evidence

14:11.784 --> 14:14.186
quicker than
those doof-butt cops.

14:14.253 --> 14:15.421
Yeah.

14:15.487 --> 14:16.555
How hard can it be
to catch a guy?

14:16.622 --> 14:18.424
Selling pirated DVDs?

14:18.490 --> 14:20.759
We go into the store undercover
and get the evidence ourselves.

14:20.826 --> 14:23.395
Wait,
what if the guy's dangerous?

14:23.462 --> 14:24.897
Half my family's dangerous.

14:24.964 --> 14:25.898
So?

14:27.399 --> 14:29.535
Freddie! Freddie!

14:31.270 --> 14:32.371
Mom, what are you doing here?

14:32.438 --> 14:33.739
I found cloud block.

14:43.449 --> 14:45.150
I never went undercover before.

14:45.217 --> 14:46.352
What are you supposed to wear?

14:46.418 --> 14:47.820
I don't know.

14:47.886 --> 14:49.888
Freddie's wearing
a robot costume.

14:51.090 --> 14:52.891
I'm gonna wear a shirt
to hide all this.

14:52.958 --> 14:55.294
The idea is just to look normal
and blend in.

14:55.361 --> 14:56.562
What is all that stuff?

14:56.629 --> 14:58.397
Well, these are microphones,

14:58.464 --> 15:00.599
This is the laptop
that'll record it all,

15:00.666 --> 15:02.468
And these things
are wireless receivers

15:02.534 --> 15:03.636
that'll pick up The signal

15:03.702 --> 15:04.770
from the cameras
you two'll be wearing.

15:04.837 --> 15:06.105
What cameras?

15:06.171 --> 15:07.673
I brought the cap-cam
and the eyeglass-cam.

15:19.051 --> 15:19.985
-Better.
-Way.

15:21.220 --> 15:22.254
There.

15:22.321 --> 15:23.255
How do I look?

15:23.322 --> 15:25.357
Chunky and lumpy.

15:25.424 --> 15:28.127
Ha, just like my aunt Judy
before she got that operation.

15:32.431 --> 15:34.400
Well...oh,
This could be our guy!

15:34.466 --> 15:35.701
Yeah, look, he's got the bag.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.236
-I see the bag!
-You think that's our guy?

15:37.303 --> 15:39.171
That is definitely our guy.

15:39.238 --> 15:40.606
You got the illegal DVD guy?

15:40.673 --> 15:44.143
No, the pizza guy.

15:44.209 --> 15:45.878
We ordered one a half-hour ago.

15:47.212 --> 15:48.981
Hope you don't mind, man.
We used your credit card.

15:51.183 --> 15:52.284
No.

15:52.351 --> 15:54.119
That's good news.

15:54.186 --> 15:55.587
Oh, hey,

15:55.654 --> 15:58.190
I think somebody Dropped
a contact lens Right there.

15:58.257 --> 15:59.291
Where? Right over here?

15:59.358 --> 16:00.626
Right there.

16:04.396 --> 16:06.231
Spanky strikes again!

16:06.298 --> 16:07.833
Yeah, he does!

16:15.040 --> 16:16.775
Hey, we're gonna go out
for a little bit.

16:16.842 --> 16:17.609
Okay.

16:17.676 --> 16:19.511
So what's with the, Uh...

16:22.047 --> 16:22.981
Bless you.

16:24.316 --> 16:25.451
I didn't sneeze.

Hey,

16:26.985 --> 16:28.087
Yeah.

16:28.153 --> 16:29.588
So far,
it's coming out All right.

16:29.655 --> 16:31.123
What about that
horrible little boy?

16:31.190 --> 16:32.691
Oh, I worked that out
with his dad.

16:32.758 --> 16:34.159
He's over there
In a large plastic tube.

16:38.864 --> 16:40.232
Nice.

16:40.299 --> 16:42.034
So where you guys going?

16:42.101 --> 16:47.473
Uh, we're just gonna run out

16:47.539 --> 16:48.540
Stuff.

Oh, uh, I need some stuff.

16:49.908 --> 16:51.210
-Yeah, not that kind of stuff.
-Bye.

16:53.011 --> 16:54.480
Bye. Have fun.

16:57.249 --> 16:58.517
You're dumb!

17:18.103 --> 17:20.839
Wow,
this store is so convenient.

17:29.114 --> 17:30.349
Can I help you?

17:30.416 --> 17:32.217
Well, you know that movie,
Scarlett's web?

17:33.986 --> 17:35.154
The spider thing?

17:35.220 --> 17:36.688
Yeah, I love that movie,

17:36.755 --> 17:38.590
but
it's really expensive To buy

17:38.657 --> 17:40.192
at well-known retail stores.

17:41.560 --> 17:42.628
So?

17:42.694 --> 17:43.962

17:44.029 --> 17:46.865
know where a girl might find
A cheaper copy?

So you do sell movies.

Sure.

19:07.179 --> 19:09.081
Guess the word's
getting around, huh?

19:09.147 --> 19:13.118
Yeah, the word that you sell
pirated movies, right?

19:13.185 --> 19:14.286
Pirate.

19:14.353 --> 19:16.955
Yeah, pirated,
like illegal copies.

19:17.022 --> 19:19.691
No, no, no,
I sell pirate movies.

19:20.659 --> 19:22.661
Movies about pirates.

19:23.829 --> 19:26.298
I make them myself
with my buddies.

19:26.365 --> 19:28.166
This is the first one
we ever made...

19:28.233 --> 19:30.168
Shiver me booty.

19:30.235 --> 19:31.436
And, uh...

19:31.503 --> 19:33.205
Oh, we made this one last year.

19:33.272 --> 19:38.076
It's called
Pirates of the Lima bee-an.

19:40.445 --> 19:41.813
And, uh,

19:41.880 --> 19:43.649
this is our
most recent release...

19:43.715 --> 19:44.883
It's called

19:46.184 --> 19:47.185
aaarrrg!

19:49.054 --> 19:50.322
Aaarrrg?

19:50.389 --> 19:51.390
That's a pirate word.

19:52.925 --> 19:56.061
It means, hello,
goodbye, Peace.

19:56.128 --> 19:58.764
It's like shalom,
only for pirates.

19:58.830 --> 20:00.232
-Interesting.
-Mm, yeah.

20:00.299 --> 20:02.834
Well, you see, You learn
something new every day.

20:02.901 --> 20:04.670
Yes, today we learned
the meaning of "arrgggg, "

20:04.736 --> 20:05.971
And that the two cops
in my apartment

20:06.038 --> 20:07.839
are even bigger Morons
than we thought.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.108
Arrrggg!

20:11.543 --> 20:13.679
Who wants to make a movie?

20:25.390 --> 20:26.458
Walk the plank!

20:26.525 --> 20:28.293
No!

20:33.532 --> 20:35.067
Sing me a ditty!

20:35.133 --> 20:36.234
No!

20:42.107 --> 20:43.141
Dance!

20:45.377 --> 20:47.179
Well, there's nothing illegal
about bad acting.

20:48.880 --> 20:51.016
I guess
we should pack up our stuff.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.451
I'll go pull our car
around front.

20:55.587 --> 20:56.888
Knock knock, enter, enter.

20:56.955 --> 20:58.924
Oh, I didn't realize
you had company.

20:58.991 --> 21:00.258
Freddie, it's time for...

21:01.727 --> 21:03.228
Fredward Benson!

21:03.295 --> 21:05.097
You got a tattoo?

21:05.163 --> 21:06.498
Uh...

21:06.565 --> 21:07.833
We told him it was wrong.

21:09.267 --> 21:10.736
"Fredward"?

21:10.802 --> 21:12.004
Mom, I...

21:12.070 --> 21:13.939
-You come with me right now.
-Where?

21:14.006 --> 21:16.208
To a doctor
to have that blemish removed!

21:16.274 --> 21:17.376
No!

21:17.442 --> 21:19.344
Removing tattoos
is extremely painful.

21:19.411 --> 21:21.847
So is being the mother
of a delinquent!

21:23.081 --> 21:24.750
-Mom, you're scaring me!
-You got a tattoo?

21:27.419 --> 21:29.921
So, when are you gonna tell him
it's a fake tattoo?

21:31.223 --> 21:33.025
Aw,
the doctor'll figure it out.

21:33.091 --> 21:34.359
-Your cousin faked it?
-Yep.

21:34.426 --> 21:37.629
Temporary, but all
the pain of a real tattoo.

21:37.696 --> 21:38.964
Mean!

21:40.666 --> 21:41.667
Come on.

21:41.733 --> 21:42.768
Let's go upstairs

21:42.834 --> 21:44.569
and start planning
the next iCarly.

21:44.636 --> 21:45.904
Aw, I don't wanna work.

21:45.971 --> 21:47.372
-Beef jerky.
-I'm coming.

21:56.882 --> 21:59.685
So, pretty cool,
you being a cop and all.

21:59.751 --> 22:00.952
Thanks.

22:01.019 --> 22:02.421
Got your own handcuffs
and everything.

22:02.487 --> 22:04.256
Oh, yeah.

22:04.322 --> 22:06.124
You know, there's an easy trick
to getting out of those.

22:06.191 --> 22:07.125
What?

22:07.192 --> 22:09.394
-No, there's not.
-Yeah?

22:09.461 --> 22:10.495
Want me to teach you?

22:10.562 --> 22:11.763
You can try.

22:11.830 --> 22:13.365
All right, come over here.

22:13.432 --> 22:14.966
All right.

22:15.033 --> 22:18.303
Now, the trick
is to stay totally relaxed

22:18.370 --> 22:20.238
Bend over this.

22:20.305 --> 22:21.339
Sure, okay.

22:22.974 --> 22:25.777
Now we just attach these
to your wrist.

22:25.844 --> 22:27.012
All right.

22:28.480 --> 22:30.482
Oh, that's tight.

22:30.549 --> 22:32.384
-There.
-Wow.

22:32.451 --> 22:33.952
All right, now, uh...

22:34.019 --> 22:35.153
How do I get out?

22:36.922 --> 22:38.023
Oh, you don't.

22:38.090 --> 22:40.859
Oh, wait, what's going' on?

22:40.926 --> 22:42.861
Payback, Spanky!

22:42.928 --> 22:44.930
No! No!

22:44.996 --> 22:46.498
-Spencer, come on!
-Yeah!

22:47.699 --> 22:49.267
-Ow!
-Yeah!

22:52.738 --> 22:54.906
Watch me spank your daddy!

22:56.007 --> 22:58.076
Close your eyes! Don't look!

23:15.527 --> 23:16.762
- Hi, my name's Will,

23:16.828 --> 23:21.066
and I want to show you
my little friends.

23:21.133 --> 23:23.835
Ahhhhhh! Ahhh!

23:23.902 --> 23:27.506
Ahhh! Ahhh! Ahhh!

23:27.572 --> 23:30.075
Ahhhhh!

23:30.142 --> 23:31.810
Ahhhhh!

23:31.877 --> 23:33.712
Ahhhhh!

23:33.779 --> 23:35.547
Ahh! "iCarly" rules.
