00:31.660 --> 00:35.420
So this Irish guy knocks on
this lady's door and says,

00:35.520 --> 00:38.340
you know, "Have you
got any, uh... Any, uh...

00:38.440 --> 00:39.541
work for me?"

00:40.000 --> 00:42.180
And she says, "Um, well, you know,

00:42.280 --> 00:44.747
as a matter of fact,
you could paint the porch."

00:48.680 --> 00:50.669
But two hours later,
the guy comes back and says,

00:51.280 --> 00:52.740
"I'm already finished, ma'am,

00:52.840 --> 00:57.025
but just for your information,
it's not a Porsche, it's a BMW."

01:46.320 --> 01:47.831
OK, asshole.

01:48.840 --> 01:49.987
Giddyap.

01:55.200 --> 01:57.740
The female lemur is a better jumper

01:57.840 --> 02:01.060
and more efficient forager
than her male counterpart.

02:01.160 --> 02:04.150
She has dominance over the male...

02:05.000 --> 02:08.020
Oh, my God... feel this.

02:08.120 --> 02:09.580
Baby's kicking. Feel.

02:09.680 --> 02:12.020
Touch it. No, not my boob.

02:12.120 --> 02:14.220
Here.

02:14.320 --> 02:16.468
Sorry we woke you up.

02:19.600 --> 02:21.828
It was him, this asshole.

02:32.200 --> 02:34.951
- What's this?
- I'm a little tight right now.

02:35.600 --> 02:38.300
My shit is not layaway.
I'm not JCPenney.

02:38.400 --> 02:40.020
You know I'm good for it.

02:40.120 --> 02:43.702
I don't make like before, Vin.
Only a few freaks like the belly.

02:44.440 --> 02:47.066
I have to save for maternity leave.

02:47.640 --> 02:49.504
Hey, I like the belly, OK?

02:50.240 --> 02:52.180
I'll see you next Tuesday.

02:52.280 --> 02:54.826
Extra when you do, OK? Double.

02:56.880 --> 02:58.940
This one here says the line is frozen.

02:59.040 --> 03:03.180
Yes, with these reverse mortgages,
you can only borrow a percentage

03:03.280 --> 03:06.260
of the equity you have in the house.
That's called the loan-to-value.

03:06.360 --> 03:09.300
But now, since you've been
getting monthly payments from us

03:09.400 --> 03:12.180
for the last... eight years,

03:12.280 --> 03:13.900
you've reached the cash-out limit.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.580
That's that loan-to-value thing
I just mentioned.

03:16.680 --> 03:19.220
- The house is worth...
- It was worth.

03:19.320 --> 03:21.661
Whatever it was worth.

03:22.600 --> 03:23.747
I need that money.

03:24.320 --> 03:27.060
I'm sorry, Mr. MacKenna,
but there's really nothing I can do.

03:28.680 --> 03:31.980
- It is what it is.
- "It is what it is"?

03:32.080 --> 03:34.860
Everyone's saying that now.
You know what it means?

03:34.960 --> 03:39.224
"You're screwed,
and you shall remain screwed."

03:59.440 --> 04:01.060
I want to close this account.

04:01.160 --> 04:03.580
I'm so sorry to hear that, sir.
May I ask why?

04:03.680 --> 04:05.740
Lady, you're just a spoke on a wheel,

04:05.840 --> 04:08.540
trying to make a living
like the rest of us schmucks.

04:08.640 --> 04:11.820
I do not want to tell you
to go fuck yourself, so let's...

04:11.920 --> 04:14.340
I'm closing it, OK?
Let's just leave it at that, please.

04:14.440 --> 04:16.144
OK.

04:19.640 --> 04:22.425
$112.14.

04:23.560 --> 04:26.140
- All right, small bills.
- No, sir.

04:26.240 --> 04:27.500
You're overdrawn that much.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.020
What does that mean?

04:29.120 --> 04:32.420
You took out more money
than you actually have in your account.

04:32.520 --> 04:34.860
Here's zero. You went below zero.

04:34.960 --> 04:38.220
So I... can't close this account?

04:38.320 --> 04:39.700
You can.

04:39.800 --> 04:41.584
Once you get it back to zero.

04:45.280 --> 04:47.064
Hey, you taking care of yourself, Vin?

04:48.040 --> 04:49.471
Yeah, blurry eyes.

04:50.240 --> 04:52.540
I'm doing aerobics, can't you tell?

04:52.640 --> 04:55.780
I'm doing the Jane Fonda workout.

04:55.880 --> 04:59.940
A one, two, three, and stretch.

05:00.040 --> 05:02.420
Janie's still looking good.

05:02.920 --> 05:06.140
Roger, is there any chance
you could ever make one of these

05:06.240 --> 05:09.980
that's strong enough for someone
that's not... your sister?

05:10.080 --> 05:11.860
Why don't we give it a break
for a minute.

05:11.960 --> 05:14.180
- Give what a break?
- The liquor.

05:14.280 --> 05:16.420
You're not gonna serve me?

05:16.520 --> 05:18.140
Don't be like that.

05:18.240 --> 05:19.860
I'm watching out for you here.

05:19.960 --> 05:21.860
You watching out for me?

05:21.960 --> 05:26.100
You serve poison all day to all these
people that don't know no better.

05:26.200 --> 05:28.540
So they can die while they're living.

05:28.640 --> 05:32.140
And you're watching out for me.
You phony.

06:57.840 --> 07:02.264
Oh, Blanche, these are my friends,
Rose and Dorothy.

07:07.680 --> 07:09.020
Come here.

08:13.880 --> 08:15.820
Shut up!

08:15.920 --> 08:17.226
People are sleeping!

08:23.080 --> 08:24.261
Piss.

08:34.640 --> 08:36.860
Hey! What's going on?

08:36.960 --> 08:39.059
You habla English?

08:39.159 --> 08:40.740
Yes, we speak English, seÃ±or.

08:40.840 --> 08:43.102
Then what the hell are you doing here?

08:44.159 --> 08:47.150
That's my tree you assholes hit.

08:48.080 --> 08:49.750
And my fence.

08:50.440 --> 08:51.587
And my damn car.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.180
Do you speak English?

08:54.280 --> 08:56.906
- Stay here.
- Yes, sir.

08:58.120 --> 09:00.020
I'm calling the cops.

09:00.120 --> 09:02.580
- Is everybody OK?
- What do you want?

09:02.680 --> 09:05.545
- I'm Maggie. I'm your new neighbor.
- So?

09:06.520 --> 09:08.020
Well, we're moving in.

09:08.120 --> 09:11.340
I can see that, yeah.
Are these dipshits with you?

09:11.440 --> 09:15.386
Yes, they're the men I hired
from the moving company.

09:16.720 --> 09:18.100
Oh, boy.

09:18.200 --> 09:20.300
"Oh, boy"? No.
"Oh, shit" is more like it.

09:20.400 --> 09:21.860
This fence is 20 years old.

09:21.960 --> 09:23.780
The car's 30.

09:23.880 --> 09:27.268
The tree is older than I am.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.100
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm not sure what I'm...

09:32.200 --> 09:34.380
This is not how I wanted
to meet, either.

09:34.480 --> 09:36.780
- Did you do this?
- Of course they did it.

09:36.880 --> 09:39.100
What are you, stupid?
Look at the crime scene.

09:39.200 --> 09:42.060
OK, you don't have to be rude to me!
I'm just trying to move in here.

09:42.160 --> 09:45.150
I hired these guys to do it.
And accidents happen.

09:47.800 --> 09:51.340
Well, the car is an antique, missy.
I mean, it's worth a lot.

09:51.440 --> 09:54.020
- Then I'll take care of it.
- You?

09:54.120 --> 09:55.580
You don't got no money.

09:55.680 --> 09:59.140
What? I mean, no offense, but you just
don't look like you do. OK?

09:59.240 --> 10:01.468
And I'm sure Chico and the Man here
are off the books.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.671
No, I will sue the moving company.

10:05.560 --> 10:08.140
You can buck up for the fence
and the tree.

10:10.760 --> 10:12.021
Fine.

10:14.320 --> 10:15.460
Toodles.

10:15.560 --> 10:17.020
Is that our new neighbor?

10:17.120 --> 10:18.500
Yep.

10:19.200 --> 10:21.240
It's gonna be a long life.

10:22.640 --> 10:23.980
"'Well,' said the tree,

10:24.080 --> 10:26.340
straightening herself up
as much as she could,

10:26.440 --> 10:28.980
'An old stump is good
for sitting and resting.

10:29.080 --> 10:31.700
Come, boy, sit down. Sit down and rest.'

10:31.800 --> 10:35.940
And the boy did.
And the tree was happy."

10:36.040 --> 10:37.460
God, that's depressing.

10:37.560 --> 10:39.020
No, it's not.

10:39.120 --> 10:40.380
The tree was meant to give,

10:40.480 --> 10:43.340
so to be able to give everything
and have nothing left

10:43.440 --> 10:45.269
is the best life
the tree could ever have.

10:46.520 --> 10:48.300
Well, your father must think I'm a tree.

10:48.400 --> 10:50.980
- Why would he think that?
- Nothing. Nothing.

10:51.080 --> 10:53.580
It's good you think good things.
Come on.

10:53.680 --> 10:55.066
Get in there.

10:55.920 --> 10:57.580
All right, big day tomorrow.

10:57.680 --> 10:59.380
Yeah, I know, first day.

10:59.480 --> 11:00.980
Yeah, for me, too.

11:01.080 --> 11:03.780
And I can't be late, all right?
It's just me and you now.

11:03.880 --> 11:06.060
- I know.
- Set your alarm

11:06.160 --> 11:09.469
and make sure I don't oversleep.
Good night.

11:11.120 --> 11:13.380
All right. Here, I made you
peanut butter and banana.

11:13.480 --> 11:14.580
- Thanks, Mom.
- OK.

11:14.680 --> 11:16.340
Do you have your snack money
in your pocket?

11:16.440 --> 11:18.260
- And your keys?
- Yep.

11:18.360 --> 11:20.380
You got your phone? Map?

11:20.480 --> 11:22.900
- Yep, on the phone.
- OK, what time do you get out?

11:23.000 --> 11:25.660
- 2:45.
- All right, come straight home,

11:25.760 --> 11:27.860
start your homework, and I'll be home
a couple hours after that.

11:29.080 --> 11:31.340
Wait, Ma, you're not gonna
pick me up or anything?

11:31.440 --> 11:35.147
I'm in the bus lane! I'm not gonna get
another ticket, Oliver! Bye, be good!

12:12.240 --> 12:13.580
OK, settle down!

12:13.680 --> 12:16.300
Settle down! Settle down!
Settle down! Settle down!

12:16.400 --> 12:19.980
I know it's hard to contain yourselves
when you're so, so young

12:20.080 --> 12:22.460
and full of sugar juice,

12:22.560 --> 12:25.580
but we must concentrate on our studies
or we will what?

12:25.680 --> 12:26.860
We will die dumb.

12:26.960 --> 12:29.980
Yes, we will, and dumbness
does not play well in Heaven.

12:30.080 --> 12:31.500
This is Oliver.

12:31.600 --> 12:34.100
Oliver is joining us midstream
here at St. Patrick,

12:34.200 --> 12:36.900
and we are very happy to have him,
are we not?

12:37.000 --> 12:40.060
Welcome to St. Patrick, Oliver.

12:41.560 --> 12:43.660
Such genuine caring. Thank you.

12:43.760 --> 12:46.860
I think you feel touched? Right?
You feel touched by that?

12:46.960 --> 12:50.906
Maybe as a thank you,
you can lead us all in morning prayer.

12:58.560 --> 13:01.700
I think... I think I'm Jewish.

13:01.800 --> 13:03.100
OK.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.950
Good to know.

13:05.720 --> 13:07.660
Oliver thinks he's Jewish.

13:07.760 --> 13:09.500
- So am I.
- I'm Buddhist.

13:09.600 --> 13:10.740
There is no God.

13:12.440 --> 13:13.940
Yes. You get the idea.

13:14.040 --> 13:17.060
We celebrate all the religions
of the world in this room, Oliver.

13:17.160 --> 13:21.220
I'm a Catholic, which is the best
of all the religions, really,

13:21.320 --> 13:23.100
because we have the most rules

13:23.200 --> 13:24.700
and the best clothes,

13:24.800 --> 13:27.820
but among us there is also
a Buddhist, agnostic.

13:27.920 --> 13:31.620
We have a Baptist,
and we have an "I don't know,"

13:31.720 --> 13:34.340
which seems to be the fastest
growing religion in the world.

13:34.440 --> 13:36.460
And now we have "I think I'm Jewish,"

13:36.560 --> 13:39.980
which is a new one for the class,
Oliver, so thanks for that,

13:40.080 --> 13:44.020
but it does not preclude you
from giving us a morning prayer.

13:44.120 --> 13:46.746
Let us bow our heads and pray.

13:47.880 --> 13:49.425
Dear...

13:50.800 --> 13:52.106
God, et cetera.

13:54.440 --> 13:58.909
Dear... Dear God... thank you?

14:02.040 --> 14:03.260
- Amen.
- Amen.

14:03.360 --> 14:05.740
- Amen! Amen, thanks be to God.
- Amen.

14:05.840 --> 14:07.940
All right, stirring stuff.

14:08.040 --> 14:10.380
Well done, Oliver.
Go grab yourself a seat.

14:10.480 --> 14:13.380
And everybody else
dust off those textbooks

14:13.480 --> 14:15.100
and go to chapter 12.

14:15.200 --> 14:18.668
That's chapter 12, Catholic saints.

14:32.480 --> 14:34.264
All right, I'm here.

14:36.920 --> 14:39.102
I'm here. I'm ready. I'm able.

14:39.320 --> 14:41.787
Let's get this. Come on.

14:48.160 --> 14:51.300
Look at that, it's Ground Pepper
sprinting ahead on the inside!

14:51.400 --> 14:53.220
Come on, dig in.

14:53.320 --> 14:54.785
Come on.

14:57.280 --> 14:58.381
Come on!

15:00.520 --> 15:01.781
One time!

15:03.480 --> 15:05.070
One damn time!

15:06.240 --> 15:08.308
You son of a bitch!

15:11.200 --> 15:15.100
I don't know why you get
so pissy, Vinny.

15:16.120 --> 15:18.791
You always lose. It seems like
you'd be comfortable by now.

15:21.920 --> 15:23.510
Yeah, tough day.

15:28.720 --> 15:30.231
Help yourself.

15:31.960 --> 15:34.940
I'm thirsty. And you owe me money, Vin.

15:35.040 --> 15:37.180
I got a situation I'm working out.

15:37.280 --> 15:39.940
You know, I'm not
the sole proprietor here.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.660
I've got other people to answer to.

15:41.760 --> 15:43.620
I just need a little time, that's all.

15:43.720 --> 15:45.185
So what do I tell them?

15:46.280 --> 15:47.381
A month.

15:49.840 --> 15:51.590
We'll split the difference.

15:52.920 --> 15:54.021
Make it two weeks.

16:17.320 --> 16:19.024
Watch out!

16:30.360 --> 16:32.383
All right, how many?

16:34.040 --> 16:35.340
And time!

16:36.720 --> 16:38.940
You can let go now.

16:39.040 --> 16:42.540
Did they have physical education
in the last school you went to?

16:42.640 --> 16:44.020
- Yes.
- Did you take it?

16:44.120 --> 16:45.745
Yes, sir.

16:51.560 --> 16:53.140
Look who it is. There's the strong man.

16:53.240 --> 16:54.620
"I think I'm Jewish."

16:54.720 --> 16:56.151
My name's Oliver, by the way.

16:57.440 --> 16:58.860
"My name's Oliver."

16:58.960 --> 17:00.540
You little turd.

17:00.640 --> 17:02.700
- Where'd you come from, anyway?
- Hello.

17:02.800 --> 17:04.500
Did you guys hear the bell?

17:04.599 --> 17:06.540
That means to move, go to class.

17:06.640 --> 17:08.424
Come on, let's go.

17:10.880 --> 17:13.186
Can't even do a sit-up.

17:13.599 --> 17:15.619
- Do you need a map?
- No, sir.

17:15.720 --> 17:18.630
Well, you better double-time it,
or you're gonna be late. Let's go.

17:22.960 --> 17:24.585
Shit.

17:32.920 --> 17:35.261
Who took his clothes?

17:41.800 --> 17:42.981
Nice shorts.

19:18.160 --> 19:19.830
Sir?

19:22.120 --> 19:23.820
Take me, God. Don't play with me.

19:23.920 --> 19:25.351
It's me, sir.

19:28.840 --> 19:29.900
Yeah, what?

19:30.000 --> 19:31.940
I was wondering
if I could use your phone?

19:32.040 --> 19:34.142
- My phone?
- Yes.

19:35.200 --> 19:37.100
- In my house?
- Yes, sir.

19:37.200 --> 19:39.500
I need to call my mom.
I'm locked out of the house,

19:39.600 --> 19:42.540
'cause these guys in gym class
took my keys and my phone

19:42.640 --> 19:44.580
and I can't get in.
And they also took my wallet.

19:44.680 --> 19:47.300
I don't need to hear
the whole story, OK?

19:47.400 --> 19:49.104
One call.

19:49.720 --> 19:52.140
Hi. It's Maggie.
Can't take your call right now.

19:52.240 --> 19:53.220
Please leave a message.

19:54.400 --> 19:57.700
Oh, hey, Mom. I, lost my keys
for the house and my wallet

19:57.800 --> 19:59.860
and my phone, and I'm at the...

19:59.960 --> 20:02.260
old guy's next-door.

20:02.360 --> 20:04.300
Sir, what's your name?

20:04.400 --> 20:08.061
- Vincent, the old guy.
- Vincent, the old guy.

20:10.360 --> 20:12.303
The mean one.

20:34.120 --> 20:36.180
What's your name?

20:36.280 --> 20:38.269
It's Oliver, sir.

20:40.120 --> 20:42.180
They let you wear
those shorts to school?

20:42.280 --> 20:45.620
Well, it's a long story, sir.

20:45.720 --> 20:47.822
I'm sure it is.

21:00.080 --> 21:01.580
Yeah?

21:01.680 --> 21:05.380
Hi. This is Maggie, Oliver's mom.

21:05.480 --> 21:07.180
Your kid's here.

21:07.280 --> 21:09.460
Yeah, I know. I got his message.
I hope that's all right.

21:09.560 --> 21:10.980
Is what all right?

21:11.080 --> 21:13.980
- That he stays there.
- Stays here?

21:14.080 --> 21:16.500
- Like what, stays here?
- I'm at work.

21:16.600 --> 21:19.220
I've got three or four more cases, and
I'm not gonna be home for a few hours,

21:19.320 --> 21:21.260
so I'm kind of in a jam here.

21:21.360 --> 21:23.020
You want me to babysit?

21:23.120 --> 21:26.660
Well, it's not...
It's not like he's a baby.

21:26.760 --> 21:29.500
I mean, he's just probably gonna
sit quietly and do his homework.

21:29.600 --> 21:31.260
He's... he's really easy.

21:31.360 --> 21:32.746
Sir, is that...

21:33.920 --> 21:35.980
- How much you paying?
- What?

21:36.080 --> 21:37.340
You want me to babysit.

21:37.440 --> 21:39.620
I'm not a philanthropy.

21:39.720 --> 21:42.630
- I don't... Ten dollars an hour?
- Twelve.

21:44.320 --> 21:47.660
OK, $12 an hour. Can I talk to him?

21:47.760 --> 21:49.589
It's for you.

21:52.080 --> 21:54.300
...I said, sit up!

21:54.400 --> 21:55.945
Up!

21:58.320 --> 22:00.300
He doesn't like many people.

22:00.400 --> 22:02.540
I'm good with animals, sir.

22:02.640 --> 22:05.903
Yeah. He doesn't usually like people
who say they're good with animals.

22:10.040 --> 22:11.060
OK, pal...

22:12.280 --> 22:14.020
You never seen Abbott and Costello?

22:14.120 --> 22:15.940
No, sir. Are they old?

22:16.040 --> 22:17.260
No.

22:17.360 --> 22:19.100
They're dead.

22:19.200 --> 22:21.620
That's the oldest you can be.

22:21.720 --> 22:23.948
Or the youngest.
Time freezes when you're dead.

22:25.560 --> 22:26.900
Where'd you learn that?

22:27.000 --> 22:28.180
A book.

22:28.280 --> 22:29.740
What book?

22:29.840 --> 22:33.023
A kids book, sir. I doubt you'd know it.

22:35.120 --> 22:36.301
It's dinnertime.

22:38.280 --> 22:41.300
- You hungry or something?
- A little, sir.

22:41.400 --> 22:42.380
That figures.

22:45.000 --> 22:48.104
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

23:11.680 --> 23:14.101
You're getting sushi.

23:17.400 --> 23:19.025
You see, your troubles are all over.

23:26.280 --> 23:27.580
That's probably your mother.

23:27.680 --> 23:29.460
Probably, sir.

23:29.760 --> 23:31.669
- Don't get up.
- OK.

23:32.680 --> 23:34.225
Hi. I...

23:36.200 --> 23:38.700
- Hi. Vincent?
- Yep.

23:38.800 --> 23:40.900
Maggie. I...

23:41.000 --> 23:42.900
Thank you for watching him.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.260
You know, with the new job and...
my boss, you know...

23:46.360 --> 23:48.827
- I don't need to hear the whole story.
- OK.

23:50.040 --> 23:51.540
Oh...

23:51.640 --> 23:52.901
Here.

23:53.680 --> 23:55.540
What'd we say? Was that...

23:55.840 --> 23:58.260
...that three hours at... at $12...

23:58.360 --> 24:00.827
- $36.
- Yeah. Yeah, I know that.

24:01.320 --> 24:04.105
- I've got two twenties.
- I don't have change.

24:05.440 --> 24:06.540
That's fine.

24:06.640 --> 24:09.060
How come you don't have anyone
to watch this kid after school?

24:09.160 --> 24:10.220
We just moved in.

24:10.320 --> 24:11.620
Where's the father?

24:11.720 --> 24:14.020
We met in college,
and it turns out that...

24:14.120 --> 24:17.300
- he had been seeing someone...
- Don't need to tell it, then.

24:17.400 --> 24:19.100
You gonna pay for my fence?

24:19.200 --> 24:20.700
Yeah, I... yes,

24:20.800 --> 24:22.900
- I said I was going to.
- And my tree?

24:23.000 --> 24:26.183
I'm not sure how...
I can pay for a branch.

24:27.160 --> 24:29.627
Everything has a price.
You're an adult, you should know that.

24:30.600 --> 24:32.500
All right. Let me know.

24:32.600 --> 24:35.220
I can watch the kid after school,
a few hours.

24:36.255 --> 24:37.660
Same price.

24:37.760 --> 24:40.181
I can do $11 an hour,
you pay the snacks.

24:41.280 --> 24:43.906
Your kid ate my last can of sardines.

24:44.440 --> 24:45.541
Really?

24:47.200 --> 24:49.223
- Smell his breath.
- They have those options...

24:51.240 --> 24:53.220
I thought you ate at Vincent's house.

24:53.320 --> 24:54.500
We had sushi.

24:54.600 --> 24:55.860
You had sushi?

24:55.960 --> 24:59.020
Well, sardines. He calls it sushi.
Didn't want to hurt his feelings.

24:59.120 --> 25:00.506
So, you like him?

25:02.000 --> 25:03.625
Well, he's interesting.

25:04.600 --> 25:06.540
Sort of cool, in a grouchy sort of way.

25:06.640 --> 25:08.629
Yeah, I'll bet he is.

25:10.760 --> 25:13.260
He has a cool cat, though, Felix.

25:13.360 --> 25:15.100
You know, he...

25:15.200 --> 25:17.380
offered to watch you after school.

25:17.480 --> 25:19.947
- He did?
- That's a horrible idea, right?

25:20.960 --> 25:22.660
Well...

25:22.760 --> 25:25.460
he lives right next door.
You can't get closer than that.

25:25.560 --> 25:28.140
Yeah, I had thought about that.

25:28.240 --> 25:32.390
You know, it would save me
from having to find a babysitter.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.780
You'll be home, though, right?

25:35.880 --> 25:38.940
Yeah, I'm gonna come home,
but sometimes late.

25:39.040 --> 25:42.260
You know, I'm the one that has to work
now. Your father's not helping.

25:42.360 --> 25:45.740
I don't know if he ever is going to.
And your school's not exactly cheap.

25:45.840 --> 25:48.500
I guess he's too old to be dangerous,

25:48.600 --> 25:50.820
and not too old to be
too dangerous, either.

25:50.920 --> 25:52.704
If you know what I mean.

26:19.160 --> 26:20.700
Stupid place.

26:20.800 --> 26:22.743
Who pissed in your Cheerios?

26:24.080 --> 26:25.260
I can't dance no more.

26:25.360 --> 26:26.740
Oh, that's a surprise.

26:26.840 --> 26:28.669
We need the money, Vin!

26:29.720 --> 26:32.180
The quality of mercy
is suddenly strained.

26:32.280 --> 26:34.700
I should sue these assholes!

26:34.800 --> 26:36.180
What's the word?

26:36.280 --> 26:38.620
Discrimination against
pregnant woman! Yes?

26:38.720 --> 26:41.580
I think you got a real good case.

26:41.680 --> 26:43.420
This stupid bump
is costing me much money.

26:43.520 --> 26:46.220
Well, he's gonna cost you
a lot more pretty soon.

26:46.320 --> 26:47.980
It's not "he."

26:48.080 --> 26:49.380
it's a she?

26:49.480 --> 26:51.420
How I know this?

26:51.520 --> 26:53.180
I look like psychic to you?

26:53.280 --> 26:55.780
No, you don't. But they have technology.

26:55.880 --> 26:57.220
Yeah, I know what they have.

26:58.503 --> 27:00.300
Well, maybe I call stripper employer

27:00.400 --> 27:02.940
and ask them to fax insurance card
to pay ultrasound.

27:03.040 --> 27:05.260
Yes?

27:05.360 --> 27:07.827
So, the question I suppose is...

27:08.760 --> 27:11.140
what is a saint? What is a saint?

27:11.240 --> 27:12.980
Does anybody know what a saint is?

27:13.080 --> 27:14.740
I don't think they do. Ooh, Rachel.

27:14.840 --> 27:18.620
Individuals who display and act
out of exceptional holiness.

27:18.720 --> 27:20.580
That's pretty perfect.
Thank you, Rachel.

27:20.680 --> 27:22.380
Who can name a saint?

27:22.480 --> 27:24.220
- Jeremiah.
- Saint Jude?

27:24.320 --> 27:26.500
Saint Jude, yes.
And what is Saint Jude known for?

27:26.600 --> 27:29.380
I think he owns a hospital, right?

27:30.600 --> 27:33.380
And a golf tournament, right?
That's what... Yeah, OK.

27:33.480 --> 27:35.980
Anyone know any modern-day saints?

27:36.080 --> 27:37.300
Bridgette.

27:37.400 --> 27:39.340
- Mother Teresa.
- Mother Teresa, yes.

27:39.440 --> 27:41.220
The big MT is a modern-day saint.

27:41.320 --> 27:43.940
So, a saint is a human being

27:44.040 --> 27:47.340
we celebrate for their commitment
and dedication

27:47.440 --> 27:49.020
to other human beings,

27:49.120 --> 27:51.980
for the sacrifices that they make,
for their hard work

27:52.080 --> 27:55.500
in making the world a better place
for those around us

27:55.600 --> 27:58.180
and for those who will follow them.

28:01.920 --> 28:03.021
Good night.

28:06.900 --> 28:08.940
- Maggie Bronstein?
- Hi.

28:09.040 --> 28:11.420
Robin called in sick.
Got six cases backed up.

28:11.520 --> 28:13.740
Yeah, I have to go
pick up my son, though, so...

28:13.840 --> 28:16.460
Sorry, can't let you clock out
without the shift being covered.

28:16.560 --> 28:17.741
Hospital policy.

28:17.880 --> 28:18.981
Oh...

28:30.080 --> 28:32.706
Come on, coward,
try to sell me something.

28:53.120 --> 28:54.500
Yeah?

28:54.600 --> 28:56.820
- Vincent?
- You evil witch.

28:56.920 --> 28:59.940
I'm gonna listen to your whole
goddamn spiel,

29:00.040 --> 29:02.500
and then I'm gonna hang up.

29:02.600 --> 29:05.860
- Vincent, it's Maggie.
- Maggie? That's a good one.

29:05.960 --> 29:09.620
Wait, is it Maggie from Calcutta,
or is it Maggie from New Delhi?

29:09.720 --> 29:11.780
No, it's your neighbor, Maggie.

29:11.880 --> 29:14.221
What the hell do you want?

29:24.240 --> 29:25.466
Let's go!

29:38.480 --> 29:40.582
You better buckle up.

29:41.280 --> 29:42.340
You're not buckled.

29:42.440 --> 29:44.588
My life is my problem.

29:47.440 --> 29:49.542
- This the way home?
- No.

29:50.480 --> 29:52.260
Hey, let's lay down some S.O. P.

29:52.360 --> 29:54.580
I don't know what S.O.P. means, sir.

29:54.680 --> 29:56.820
Standard operating procedure.

29:56.920 --> 30:00.060
You go where I go, you do what I say,

30:00.160 --> 30:03.380
get your homework done somewhere
along the way, but most importantly,

30:03.480 --> 30:05.420
you don't annoy me.

30:05.520 --> 30:07.100
I am not happy when I'm annoyed.

30:07.200 --> 30:09.507
Are you annoyed right now?

30:11.000 --> 30:13.023
Not particularly.

30:14.200 --> 30:16.507
Really?

30:22.200 --> 30:23.460
Here's a dime.

30:23.560 --> 30:26.061
Call your mom,
tell her you're wearing your seat belt.

30:27.160 --> 30:28.380
It costs more than a dime.

30:28.480 --> 30:30.020
Since when?

30:30.120 --> 30:31.984
Since before I was born.

30:33.720 --> 30:35.940
What is this country coming to?

30:36.040 --> 30:37.585
Right here.

30:39.240 --> 30:42.549
If it costs more than that,
call collect.

31:07.480 --> 31:10.620
- Hey, look. It's dipshit.
- You live in this neighborhood?

31:10.720 --> 31:13.180
I probably got detention
'cause of you, asshole.

31:13.280 --> 31:15.060
You got detention
'cause you took my stuff.

31:15.160 --> 31:18.150
How do you know I took it, you narc?

31:19.040 --> 31:20.426
Oh, yeah!

31:22.800 --> 31:24.026
He just slapped you!

31:25.440 --> 31:26.620
Stop!

31:31.600 --> 31:33.025
You got him.

31:35.520 --> 31:37.380
Listen, the next time the teachers
ask you what happened,

31:37.480 --> 31:38.940
you don't say anything! You got me?

31:39.040 --> 31:41.420
- Get off me!
- No! I don't care!

31:41.520 --> 31:43.980
So you can go crying
to your mommy! Cry...

31:44.080 --> 31:46.340
What are you little shit heels doing?

31:46.440 --> 31:48.060
Is that you, Robert Ocinski?

31:48.160 --> 31:50.060
No, sir. My name's John.

31:50.160 --> 31:51.700
Bullshit, you little prick.

31:51.800 --> 31:53.020
You're Briana's kid.

31:53.120 --> 31:56.020
Only Puerto Rican Polack in Brooklyn.

31:56.120 --> 31:59.100
Well, I got a deal
for you little bully shit heels.

31:59.200 --> 32:00.860
Whatever you do to this guy here,

32:00.960 --> 32:02.820
I'm gonna do to your mothers.

32:02.920 --> 32:05.500
You understand? And in the meantime...

32:06.120 --> 32:07.220
ride this.

32:07.320 --> 32:10.180
- What the...
- Run!

32:10.280 --> 32:11.900
- Come on, let's get out, man!
- Run, you little...

32:12.000 --> 32:13.060
Get out of here!

32:13.160 --> 32:14.780
Get moving, you little shits!

32:14.880 --> 32:17.267
Let's get out of here!
The old man's crazy!

32:21.680 --> 32:24.545
What, you waiting
for a paper invitation?

32:34.680 --> 32:36.500
Who taught you to slap?

32:36.600 --> 32:38.700
I don't know, sir.
Just an instinct, I guess.

32:38.800 --> 32:41.426
Yeah, well, you need to unlearn that.

32:43.640 --> 32:44.820
I'm allergic, sir.

32:44.920 --> 32:46.704
To what?

32:47.760 --> 32:49.703
Cigarette smoke.

32:50.880 --> 32:53.860
Your father never taught you
to defend yourself?

32:53.960 --> 32:55.940
No, sir. He's a pacifist.

32:56.040 --> 32:59.340
Well, this country wasn't founded by
tree huggers, that's for sure.

32:59.440 --> 33:01.940
No, you need to defend yourself,
or you get mowed down.

33:02.040 --> 33:04.300
I'm small, if you haven't noticed.

33:04.400 --> 33:07.780
- Yeah, so was Hitler.
- That's a horrible comparison.

33:07.880 --> 33:10.380
Indeed. Making a point, though.

33:10.480 --> 33:11.581
Small means nothing.

33:12.520 --> 33:13.906
It's what's in here.

33:16.200 --> 33:17.665
Or here, sir.

33:44.520 --> 33:47.020
OK, powerhouse.

33:47.120 --> 33:49.461
Grab the basket.

34:05.240 --> 34:07.707
- Hey.
- Hey, Vin.

34:08.880 --> 34:11.420
This place is like a mansion.

34:11.520 --> 34:14.219
OK, when we get in there, no talking.

34:14.320 --> 34:16.219
Where are we going?

34:16.320 --> 34:20.391
You know, this is a great chance
for you to practice no talking.

34:21.520 --> 34:23.429
Come on.

34:24.800 --> 34:26.739
Sorry I'm late.

34:26.840 --> 34:28.820
There you are, Doctor.

34:28.920 --> 34:30.500
Nice to see you, Sandy.

34:30.600 --> 34:32.100
How you feeling?

34:32.199 --> 34:34.060
Today is my birthday.

34:34.159 --> 34:35.460
OK.

34:35.560 --> 34:37.460
Happy birthday.

34:37.560 --> 34:39.503
What are you, 17?

34:41.159 --> 34:43.228
Oh, will you put those things
in those drawers?

34:46.760 --> 34:48.862
All right, Sandy.

34:49.920 --> 34:52.591
Let's see how the old ticker's working.

34:55.639 --> 34:58.740
Can you... tell them I don't like...

34:58.840 --> 35:01.300
the green beans

35:01.400 --> 35:04.100
when they put the bacon bits

35:04.200 --> 35:05.711
chopped up in there with them?

35:07.360 --> 35:09.110
It's too greasy for me.

35:13.200 --> 35:14.665
Will do, Sandy.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.228
Well, as near as I can tell...

35:18.960 --> 35:20.983
you're still beautiful.

35:23.200 --> 35:26.747
Perhaps you require a second opinion
from my associate.

35:27.800 --> 35:29.231
Beautiful.

35:36.640 --> 35:38.500
You know, we can do
the laundry here, Vin.

35:38.600 --> 35:40.380
- We have a service.
- Thanks.

35:40.480 --> 35:42.060
It gives me something to do.

35:42.160 --> 35:43.180
Who's your helper?

35:43.280 --> 35:45.620
He's 11 bucks an hour.

35:45.720 --> 35:47.820
It's Oliver, actually.

35:47.920 --> 35:49.740
Nice to meet you, Oliver. I'm Ana.

35:49.840 --> 35:51.300
- Hi.
- Hi.

35:51.400 --> 35:52.500
OK, thanks.

35:52.600 --> 35:53.700
OK.

35:53.800 --> 35:55.220
Oh, wait.

35:56.680 --> 35:58.380
She don't like the string beans.

35:58.480 --> 36:01.700
- I'll make a note. What's she prefer?
- Broccoli.

36:01.800 --> 36:04.020
Broccoli's good.

36:04.120 --> 36:07.224
- OK, thanks.
- Take care, Vin.

36:11.920 --> 36:13.749
And time.

36:15.640 --> 36:18.620
OK. Well, that's just gonna
get you beat up pretty bad.

36:18.720 --> 36:20.540
I don't want to fight, anyway.

36:20.640 --> 36:23.940
Well, nobody wants to fight. You know?
You think I wanted to go to war?

36:24.040 --> 36:26.740
You think an 18-year-old kid wants
to sit in a rice paddy

36:26.840 --> 36:29.380
- with bullets whizzing by his head?
- When was that?

36:29.480 --> 36:31.420
- Vietnam.
- You were there?

36:31.520 --> 36:33.060
I think I'm imagining it.

36:33.160 --> 36:36.940
All right, I'm gonna show you one thing,
and it's probably your best shot.

36:37.040 --> 36:39.420
If you do it right,
you can break the guy's nose.

36:39.520 --> 36:42.180
- Break his nose?
- Relax. You're not gonna get it right.

36:42.280 --> 36:43.940
All right. OK.

36:44.040 --> 36:46.780
He's bigger than you,
so you get down below him like this,

36:46.880 --> 36:48.460
you squat like this...

36:48.560 --> 36:50.100
just crouch...

36:50.200 --> 36:52.100
and you stand up real hard,

36:52.200 --> 36:54.500
and you push all the way
through your legs,

36:54.600 --> 36:58.340
all the way up, your shoulders,
your butt, everything pushes up,

36:58.440 --> 37:02.340
and you push all the way up through that
arm and go whack, right in the snoot.

37:03.120 --> 37:05.063
Right? Try it on me. Ready?

37:11.520 --> 37:13.463
OK, but you got to do it
faster than that, right?

37:16.160 --> 37:17.860
OK. All right, now...

37:28.720 --> 37:30.380
Maggie Bronstein?

37:30.480 --> 37:32.460
- I have Mace!
- OK.

37:32.560 --> 37:36.140
I've got papers.
Kings County Family Court.

37:36.240 --> 37:38.263
As they say, you've been served.

37:57.440 --> 38:00.420
Yeah, I know you worked
some extra hours, so...

38:00.520 --> 38:02.622
I'm gonna cover it.

38:03.240 --> 38:04.785
I wasn't offering a discount.

38:08.760 --> 38:10.820
So, what have you been crying about?

38:10.920 --> 38:13.340
- It's a long story.
- OK.

38:13.440 --> 38:16.271
What's the punch line?

38:17.600 --> 38:19.145
My ex wants custody.

38:25.440 --> 38:27.941
There goes my job security.

38:34.520 --> 38:36.827
Thanks, you asshole.

38:38.520 --> 38:40.660
That could've gone either way.

38:40.760 --> 38:43.740
It's gonna be cold for a second, OK?

38:43.840 --> 38:46.625
See there? That's the baby's head.

38:48.120 --> 38:50.060
This is very big head.

38:50.160 --> 38:52.220
Maybe good, no?

38:52.320 --> 38:54.580
It's the biggest part at this age.

38:54.680 --> 38:58.466
And these... are her little legs.

38:59.960 --> 39:02.100
She?

39:02.200 --> 39:03.540
You didn't know?

39:03.640 --> 39:05.663
Sorry. Did you not want to know?

39:07.120 --> 39:09.541
No. It's good to know.

39:16.080 --> 39:18.300
I couldn't verify with your insurance,
Mr. MacKenna.

39:18.400 --> 39:20.100
We are just married.

39:20.200 --> 39:21.860
- That happened.
- Really?

39:21.960 --> 39:24.620
Yeah, I told insurance.
You know how slow they are.

39:24.720 --> 39:28.300
I mean, the bureaucracy
and the paperwork.

39:28.400 --> 39:31.709
I mean, what is a co-pay running,
anyway?

39:32.840 --> 39:33.987
Twenty dollars.

39:34.880 --> 39:36.100
This is good price, no?

39:36.200 --> 39:38.740
For you, only the best.

39:38.840 --> 39:40.940
You're worth it.

39:41.040 --> 39:42.580
Thank you, sugarplum.

39:42.680 --> 39:44.860
You owe me, lady.

39:44.960 --> 39:46.471
Here.

39:47.600 --> 39:49.907
- See you later.
- OK. Take care of yourselves.

40:14.840 --> 40:16.140
Hey!

40:16.240 --> 40:19.100
- Hi, Ma.
- What are you doing?

40:19.200 --> 40:20.380
I'm mowing Vin's lawn.

40:20.480 --> 40:23.151
Well... Hey, Vin!

40:24.680 --> 40:26.660
I was sleeping. Thanks for that.

40:26.760 --> 40:29.180
Why is he mowing your dirt patch?

40:29.280 --> 40:30.940
Oh, yeah, he's paying me hourly.

40:31.040 --> 40:33.260
I'm showing him how the world works.

40:33.360 --> 40:35.940
You work, you get paid, you drink.

40:36.040 --> 40:38.029
Are you drinking alcohol?

40:41.240 --> 40:42.380
I honestly don't remember.

40:42.480 --> 40:44.900
All right, let's go.
I'm gonna make dinner.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.980
- You can do homework.
- I already ate.

40:47.080 --> 40:49.420
Stop mow... You're mowing dirt.
Let's go.

40:49.520 --> 40:53.700
He's fed, the homework's checked,
I've done my job, I'm taking a break.

40:55.040 --> 40:58.020
- Payday tomorrow.
- OK. Come on, let's... Leave it.

40:58.120 --> 40:59.710
There's no grass.

41:01.240 --> 41:02.690
Bye, Vin.

41:06.480 --> 41:07.911
Come on, come on.

41:11.280 --> 41:13.020
- You're out!
- Good luck.

41:13.120 --> 41:15.780
Get ready for a red ass,
you little shit bag.

41:15.880 --> 41:18.108
- All right, we got him.
- Come on, come on.

41:23.320 --> 41:25.122
Missed it!

41:26.640 --> 41:28.265
Say your prayers, you little pussy.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.340
- What happened? What happened here?
- I don't know.

41:38.440 --> 41:39.780
- You don't know?
- It's not my fault.

41:39.880 --> 41:41.186
Let me see.

41:44.200 --> 41:46.940
You asshole, dick bag, son of a whore!

41:47.040 --> 41:48.141
Whoa! Bronstein!

42:25.320 --> 42:27.420
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

42:27.520 --> 42:29.460
I am Daka.

42:29.560 --> 42:31.060
Who are you?

42:31.160 --> 42:34.389
- I'm Oliver.
- Oliver.

42:36.080 --> 42:38.260
Why you bang this door so much?

42:38.360 --> 42:39.940
He's hard of hearing!

42:40.040 --> 42:41.580
Let him in!

42:41.680 --> 42:43.703
Don't yell at me!

42:52.880 --> 42:55.300
You broke his nose?

42:55.400 --> 42:57.460
Yes, sir, I think so.
There was blood everywhere.

42:57.560 --> 43:00.100
- You should've seen it.
- I wish I had.

43:00.200 --> 43:03.060
You must have got him
just right. Show me.

43:03.160 --> 43:04.261
OK.

43:04.480 --> 43:05.627
Ha-yah!

43:07.680 --> 43:09.500
You teach him fighting?

43:09.600 --> 43:10.980
He's a little runt, you know?

43:11.080 --> 43:13.148
He's got to learn how to defend himself.

43:14.600 --> 43:16.304
Fighting is for assholes.

43:17.840 --> 43:19.908
Where's my money?

43:20.920 --> 43:22.260
It's on the dresser.

43:23.800 --> 43:25.300
Minus the co-pay.

43:25.400 --> 43:27.580
You don't teach children.

43:27.680 --> 43:28.781
Yah!

43:30.960 --> 43:32.107
Look at you.

43:37.680 --> 43:39.623
Breaking his nose!

43:41.240 --> 43:43.342
Who is she?

43:44.520 --> 43:46.780
A lady of the night.

43:46.880 --> 43:48.940
What's that?

43:49.040 --> 43:55.500
It's one of the more honest ways
to make a living.

44:05.280 --> 44:07.340
The board tells you
the action for the day,

44:07.440 --> 44:09.540
race number, who's running,

44:09.640 --> 44:11.660
who's riding, and so forth.

44:11.760 --> 44:13.380
What's 20-slash-one?

44:13.480 --> 44:14.980
That's odds.

44:15.080 --> 44:16.660
Some bookie out of Vegas thinks

44:16.760 --> 44:19.100
that that horse has
a one-in-20 chance of winning.

44:19.200 --> 44:20.500
What do you get if he does?

44:20.600 --> 44:21.980
20 times your money.

44:22.080 --> 44:23.380
That's a good deal.

44:23.480 --> 44:25.389
If you win, sure.

44:27.760 --> 44:29.900
That one with the wraps is a dog.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.740
Doesn't sound like a compliment.

44:31.840 --> 44:35.420
Not for a horse. No, the odds
of him winning are astronomical.

44:35.520 --> 44:37.220
Long odds, bigger payout.

44:37.320 --> 44:39.787
We should take him across the board.

44:41.280 --> 44:43.986
Well, don't get ahead of yourself, kid.

44:51.080 --> 44:53.220
- Are you praying?
- Praying?

44:53.320 --> 44:54.500
That's what it looks like.

44:54.600 --> 44:56.580
I thought we talked about
you not talking.

44:56.680 --> 44:58.589
What's a trifecta?

45:02.480 --> 45:05.660
You pick, three horses: one, two, three,

45:05.760 --> 45:10.420
in the order they finish,
and it's a high risk, high reward.

45:10.520 --> 45:11.985
Sounds improbable.

45:13.120 --> 45:17.066
Well, if you're gonna gamble, you might
as well have a chance to win big.

45:17.800 --> 45:19.660
Harvey Knows Best, Sweeter Lady,

45:19.760 --> 45:21.460
Champagne Flute.

45:21.560 --> 45:23.300
One, two, three.

45:23.400 --> 45:26.100
800-to-1.

45:26.200 --> 45:28.020
You got any money?

45:28.120 --> 45:29.346
Sure.

45:34.880 --> 45:37.380
- Seven dollars.
- What is that, lunch money?

45:37.480 --> 45:38.740
Yes, sir.

45:38.840 --> 45:41.022
Well, you might as well
learn the hard way.

45:41.840 --> 45:44.705
I'll throw in some, too.
That's called mitigation.

45:45.920 --> 45:48.220
What's... mitigation?

45:48.320 --> 45:51.549
That's where you throw in seven
and I throw in three.

45:55.920 --> 45:57.860
And they're off!

45:57.960 --> 46:01.060
Sweeter Lady takes the lead
by a length and a half...

46:01.160 --> 46:03.300
Come on. Come on.

46:03.400 --> 46:05.070
...and here comes Harvey Knows Best!

46:06.640 --> 46:11.220
Harvey Knows Best making a final surge
as they come around for the line!

46:11.320 --> 46:12.581
This is ridiculous!

46:14.160 --> 46:16.060
This is really happening! Don't stop!

46:16.160 --> 46:18.100
Don't stop!

46:18.200 --> 46:20.500
Don't stop! Don't stop!

46:20.600 --> 46:21.940
This is ridiculous!

46:22.040 --> 46:23.380
- Yeah! Yeah!
- This is ridiculous!

46:23.480 --> 46:25.060
- Go! Go!
- Yeah!

46:25.160 --> 46:27.820
Don't stop! Just hang on, please!

46:28.320 --> 46:30.683
And it will be Harvey Knows Best

46:30.783 --> 46:33.780
followed by Sweeter Lady
and Champagne Flute.

46:33.880 --> 46:38.260
- This isn't fair! It's not fair!
- We won, didn't we?

46:38.360 --> 46:40.340
Just roll with this,
just roll with this, man.

46:40.440 --> 46:43.540
Just roll with this,
and act like you didn't win it.

46:43.640 --> 46:47.380
- Shit!
- No, no, it didn't work for us.

46:47.480 --> 46:48.940
Do you understand me?

46:49.040 --> 46:51.580
It didn't happen. We didn't win at all.

46:51.680 --> 46:53.460
We didn't win anything, OK?

46:55.680 --> 46:58.181
Thank you.

47:41.320 --> 47:46.220
Good afternoon... Mr. MacKenna.

47:46.320 --> 47:48.660
I need to open up
a savings account for my grandson.

47:48.760 --> 47:49.780
Oh...

47:49.880 --> 47:52.740
And this'll get my account up to zero.

47:52.840 --> 47:55.147
Close me out
while you're tapping away over there.

47:56.680 --> 47:58.540
Don't ever become a pencil pusher, kid.

47:58.640 --> 48:00.708
They're spineless.

48:39.880 --> 48:40.940
Hello, Mrs. Bronstein.

48:41.040 --> 48:45.907
This is Dan O'Brien,
principal here at St. Patrick.

48:47.400 --> 48:52.780
A few days ago, your son, Oliver,
was involved in a fight at school.

48:52.880 --> 48:55.500
- We've tried to reach you...
- What?

48:57.640 --> 48:59.220
If you're a telemarketer,

48:59.320 --> 49:02.060
please leave a message
so I can not return your call.

49:03.480 --> 49:05.140
Vin.

49:05.240 --> 49:07.263
Vin? Oliver?

49:07.960 --> 49:10.188
Oliver, it's Mom. Pick up.

49:11.000 --> 49:12.670
Hello?

49:15.760 --> 49:17.703
You want another?

49:18.400 --> 49:19.540
Yes, please.

49:19.640 --> 49:21.788
Go for it. We're living today.

49:23.560 --> 49:24.940
Excuse me, sir?

49:26.160 --> 49:28.661
You kids. Damn small talkers.

49:29.360 --> 49:32.020
There's no point in yapping
if no one's listening.

49:32.120 --> 49:35.700
- Let's hear it.
- Excuse me, sir!

49:35.800 --> 49:38.380
You can't get nothing in this world
without being heard.

49:40.280 --> 49:41.940
Another Coke, please.

49:42.040 --> 49:43.540
And you can hit me, too, Rog.

49:43.640 --> 49:45.180
We're out of your bourbon.

49:45.280 --> 49:47.030
You cleaned me out.

49:48.560 --> 49:52.660
Rog... don't lie to me. Be a man.

49:52.760 --> 49:55.860
Vin. And he's not supposed
to be sitting at the bar.

49:55.960 --> 49:58.980
You're right. We're gonna go
somewhere else to spend our money.

49:59.080 --> 50:02.900
Hey, he's only doing his job there, Vin.

50:03.000 --> 50:04.020
Be nice.

50:04.120 --> 50:05.380
Oh!

50:05.480 --> 50:06.786
Damn!

50:08.800 --> 50:10.900
- Amber, get the first-aid kit.
- OK.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.220
But it's just a cut. I got lots of 'em.

50:13.320 --> 50:15.620
Here, here.

50:15.720 --> 50:18.180
Man, you're bleeding all over the bar.

50:18.280 --> 50:20.860
That's fine. Kid's got to do homework.

50:20.960 --> 50:22.346
Come on, let's go.

50:46.920 --> 50:49.140
- Hi, Mom.
- Where were you?

50:49.240 --> 50:50.860
Where the hell is your car, Vin?

50:50.960 --> 50:52.860
- It broke down.
- Broke down.

50:52.960 --> 50:54.903
Oh, it broke down? Really?

50:55.520 --> 50:58.942
I don't appreciate you
taking him anywhere without asking me.

50:59.680 --> 51:00.900
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

51:01.000 --> 51:04.140
Could you not be a smart-ass,
just for once? OK?

51:04.240 --> 51:07.540
I want to know where my son is
at all times, OK?

51:07.640 --> 51:10.180
- We just went to... eat.
- He should starve?

51:10.280 --> 51:11.860
Go in the house, Oliver.

51:11.960 --> 51:14.740
- Mom...
- Go in the house, Oliver.

51:14.840 --> 51:16.540
Good night, Vin.

51:16.640 --> 51:18.742
Yeah, we'll see about that.

51:20.080 --> 51:22.420
You know, he's getting in fights
at school. Did you know that?

51:22.520 --> 51:24.060
Yeah, he mentioned something like that.

51:24.160 --> 51:26.100
Yeah? Well, he didn't mention
anything to me about it.

51:26.200 --> 51:29.900
Oh, well, maybe you haven't noticed,
but you haven't been home much.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.980
It's difficult to have a conversation
with someone that's not here.

51:33.080 --> 51:34.341
Oh, we're gonna do that?

51:35.240 --> 51:37.980
God, I love when somebody like you
tells somebody like me advice,

51:38.080 --> 51:39.180
especially on parenting.

51:39.280 --> 51:40.940
I didn't sign on for the hormones,
dearie,

51:41.040 --> 51:43.260
so that's gonna cost you
15 bucks an hour.

51:43.360 --> 51:44.980
You know why you never had kids?

51:45.080 --> 51:48.540
Because you don't want to think
about anybody other than yourself.

51:48.640 --> 51:51.630
What do you know about me, really?

51:52.600 --> 51:54.190
Tell me. I'd love it.

51:55.360 --> 51:58.140
Nothing. I don't know a thing about you,
just the way you want it.

51:58.240 --> 52:01.150
Then you can act like a prick
and it keeps everybody away.

52:02.520 --> 52:03.980
If it ain't broken...

52:04.080 --> 52:06.180
it is broken, Vin. Take a look at it.

52:06.280 --> 52:08.660
All right, I'm at 40 hours
for this week.

52:08.760 --> 52:11.147
At 41, I go to time and a half.

52:13.240 --> 52:15.308
Excuse me, is someone gonna pay me?

52:17.960 --> 52:20.984
You've got to be kidding me.

52:23.000 --> 52:25.100
I can't even say these words.

52:25.200 --> 52:26.745
They're creative.

52:27.400 --> 52:30.380
- Yes.
- That's one way to put it.

52:31.180 --> 52:34.940
Well... adjusting to a new school

52:35.040 --> 52:36.980
- is tough on children at this age.
- Yep.

52:37.080 --> 52:39.380
At any age, really,
and I don't want to minimize that.

52:39.480 --> 52:45.340
But is there anything else going on
that we should be aware of?

52:45.440 --> 52:48.220
Oh, I wouldn't even know where to start.

52:48.320 --> 52:50.340
- How about his father?
- Well,

52:50.440 --> 52:51.860
I don't want to take up all your time.

52:53.040 --> 52:54.869
We have loads of time.

52:57.920 --> 53:00.420
We're in the middle of a divorce.

53:00.520 --> 53:03.940
Oliver's father was having
an affair with his assistant,

53:04.040 --> 53:05.580
and our accountant,

53:05.680 --> 53:09.100
and my hairdresser,
while she was still doing my hair,

53:09.200 --> 53:10.820
so that was fun.

53:10.920 --> 53:13.260
And now he's filed for custody
of Oliver,

53:13.360 --> 53:15.180
full custody.

53:15.280 --> 53:17.740
And he won't pay any support
until he gets what he wants.

53:17.840 --> 53:19.980
- Plus, he's a lawyer.
- Shit.

53:20.080 --> 53:22.900
So I just had to get out of there
as fast as I could,

53:23.000 --> 53:24.420
and I took Oliver with me,

53:24.520 --> 53:26.100
and I got a job at Mission Hills.

53:26.200 --> 53:28.060
I'm a CAT scan tech.

53:28.160 --> 53:32.620
So I just see...
really rough stuff all day.

53:32.720 --> 53:35.060
You know, cancer and tumors

53:35.160 --> 53:38.380
and cysts and clots,
and I see what I'm looking at,

53:38.480 --> 53:40.900
but I can't tell, you know, the people

53:41.000 --> 53:44.420
that are laying there,
so that's... miserable all day.

53:44.520 --> 53:45.780
And I work really late,

53:45.880 --> 53:50.668
because I'm trying
to get our act together.

53:52.360 --> 53:55.940
That's why he's here,
so he can have a good education,

53:56.040 --> 54:00.060
and I'm trying to just give him
a semi-normal life,

54:00.160 --> 54:04.980
and I'm dealing with this shit
from David and... custody.

54:05.080 --> 54:07.182
I'm sorry about swearing.

54:09.200 --> 54:12.940
I know he didn't even want kids.

54:13.040 --> 54:14.220
He didn't want them.

54:14.320 --> 54:16.740
He's just doing this so I'm not happy.

54:16.840 --> 54:18.700
You know Oliver's adopted.

54:18.800 --> 54:20.500
- Did you know that?
- I didn't.

54:20.600 --> 54:21.980
I don't know how you would, but he is.

54:22.080 --> 54:27.220
And... I cannot have... kids.

54:27.320 --> 54:30.060
You know, something about
my fallopian tubes being twisted.

54:30.160 --> 54:32.500
I think, what I really think,

54:32.600 --> 54:35.909
is that they were just recoiling
from David's sperm.

54:37.160 --> 54:39.860
Can I... Can I just have one?

54:39.960 --> 54:41.740
Thank you. Thank you for that.

54:41.840 --> 54:47.300
So I just think that all of this
has kind of permeated, you know,

54:47.400 --> 54:49.820
Oliver's whole little being, right?

54:49.920 --> 54:51.820
I mean, it has to.

54:51.920 --> 54:54.180
He's like a little,
like a little sponge.

54:54.280 --> 54:56.740
My real name's Robert.

54:56.840 --> 54:58.180
Ocinski's my last name.

54:59.240 --> 55:01.900
People call me that ever since Geraghty
called me that last year.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.820
Now everyone calls me that.

55:04.920 --> 55:07.380
It's not like I can
go around and tell them,

55:07.480 --> 55:09.580
"Hey, dickwad, don't call me Ocinski.

55:09.680 --> 55:11.500
My name's Robert."

55:11.600 --> 55:14.340
'Cause I would spend
my whole life doing that.

55:14.440 --> 55:16.140
You taking a wiz?

55:16.240 --> 55:18.183
Sorry, can't hold it.

55:19.600 --> 55:21.260
Robert was my dad's name.

55:21.360 --> 55:23.540
So I'm a junior.

55:23.640 --> 55:25.020
He's not around, though.

55:25.120 --> 55:28.064
I don't really know him,
'cause he left when I was a baby.

55:29.520 --> 55:31.460
Yeah, my dad's not around, either.

55:31.560 --> 55:34.700
He did some bad things to my mom,
so we left him.

55:34.800 --> 55:37.141
Haven't seen him in a while.

55:38.560 --> 55:42.187
I kind of miss him, though.
My mom's being a jerk.

55:43.360 --> 55:44.461
They do that, man.

55:57.800 --> 56:01.620
Hey, your dad the one
that taught you how to fight?

56:01.720 --> 56:03.788
No, my babysitter.

56:05.480 --> 56:08.345
Tide comes in twice a day, Doctor.

56:08.800 --> 56:12.109
Yeah, that's the tide, comes and goes.

56:13.880 --> 56:15.740
I can't wait for autumn.

56:16.960 --> 56:19.260
They plant the most beautiful mums
all around the water.

56:19.360 --> 56:22.380
- Yeah?
- Every color you can imagine.

56:22.480 --> 56:24.708
I don't know where they get them all.

56:25.880 --> 56:27.664
At the garden store.

56:30.440 --> 56:32.907
You've always been so funny, Vin.

56:34.040 --> 56:35.980
Vin?

56:36.080 --> 56:38.547
Vin, it's Vin, Sandy.

56:43.560 --> 56:44.707
The ducks eat them, though.

56:46.600 --> 56:48.460
We have to shoo them away.

56:48.560 --> 56:51.105
It's such a shame.

56:52.920 --> 56:54.988
It's a shame.

57:00.680 --> 57:04.260
There's plenty of affordable
health care options, Vin.

57:04.360 --> 57:06.100
I'm sure you know that.

57:06.200 --> 57:07.340
Sunnyside is pricey.

57:07.440 --> 57:09.941
Not for everyone.

57:10.760 --> 57:13.620
Well, my Sandy gets the best.

57:13.720 --> 57:16.100
I just, I'll just have to figure it out.

57:16.200 --> 57:18.060
I understand that,
but you're months behind,

57:18.160 --> 57:21.140
and we are not in the credit business,
as you know.

57:21.240 --> 57:24.820
- What's that mean?
- We need payment in full

57:24.920 --> 57:26.460
and three months in advance.

57:26.560 --> 57:27.820
Got it.

57:27.920 --> 57:29.060
By next week.

57:29.160 --> 57:31.866
- Next week?
- Yeah, next week.

57:35.320 --> 57:37.991
Well, I can give you 20 percent...

57:39.400 --> 57:43.141
- ...in good faith?
- Vin, we're past good faith. I'm sorry.

57:43.840 --> 57:46.500
We will transfer Sandy
wherever you want to put her.

57:46.600 --> 57:48.420
Put her?

57:48.520 --> 57:51.146
That's it or we get the boot?

57:51.880 --> 57:55.020
I don't think that's the best way
to phrase what's happening.

57:55.120 --> 57:58.030
OK, what's the best way to phrase it?

57:58.840 --> 58:00.544
It is what it is.

58:03.080 --> 58:05.740
Let's get some new plants
for the room, OK?

58:05.840 --> 58:08.300
I can have the desk order something.

58:08.400 --> 58:10.980
Well, I was hoping maybe for mums.

58:11.080 --> 58:12.980
Sure.

58:13.080 --> 58:15.700
And here's a little something
for your trouble.

58:15.800 --> 58:18.620
Oh, no. Vin, this is my job.
I take care of people. Please.

58:18.720 --> 58:21.980
- You go way beyond your job, Ana.
- Oh!

58:22.080 --> 58:24.660
You've been an angel to my Sandy.

58:24.760 --> 58:26.700
OK, Vin. We don't make a habit now, OK?

58:26.800 --> 58:29.187
It can't happen, I'm shit broke.

58:31.320 --> 58:32.540
You got a nice smile.

58:32.640 --> 58:34.300
You should do it more often.

58:34.400 --> 58:35.581
I'll get the laundry.

58:52.360 --> 58:53.746
There you go.

58:57.280 --> 58:58.381
It's a lot lighter.

58:59.440 --> 59:01.349
She didn't change much this week.

59:02.760 --> 59:05.386
Well... easy on my back.

59:06.920 --> 59:09.830
- Thanks.
- Behave yourself, Vin.

59:21.680 --> 59:23.340
He'll pay hundred dollars.

59:23.440 --> 59:26.380
$100? I pay more than that
for one prescription.

59:26.480 --> 59:29.860
He said this is for epilepsy,

59:29.960 --> 59:31.420
for prostate flaring,

59:31.520 --> 59:33.940
and to soften the shitting.

59:34.040 --> 59:35.860
That should have some value.

59:35.960 --> 59:37.744
For who? You?

59:39.120 --> 59:40.904
We need the... I need the dough.

59:41.800 --> 59:43.420
I... 500 bucks!

59:43.520 --> 59:45.180
This is all high-dollar shit.

59:45.280 --> 59:47.060
He said 100, Vin.

59:47.160 --> 59:48.220
You take it or leave this.

59:48.320 --> 59:50.422
You can't sell this to get high.

59:52.680 --> 59:55.021
I'll take a hundred.

59:57.480 --> 59:58.860
Oh, you'll take a hundred?

59:58.960 --> 01:00:00.710
Stupid...

01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:17.540
Hello there.

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:20.420
- Your account's closed, Mr. MacKenna.
- Yeah, I know that.

01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:24.022
This withdraw is on my grandson's
account. I think I'm on it.

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:27.421
How much, sir?

01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:29.980
What's the balance?

01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:34.947
$2,700.

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:40.940
I'll take all that.

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:42.500
How would you like that?

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:44.623
Hundreds, please.

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:51.780
It's $2,700, Larry.

01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:55.420
I want a $450 trifecta box
in the third, OK?

01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:56.780
I want one, two, three:

01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:59.580
Lucky Lincoln, New Dime, Sammy's Savior.

01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:02.980
Thank you, sir.

01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:04.580
This is gonna make it all better.

01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:05.827
OK.

01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:10.940
New Dime drops back to sixth,
while back on the rail,

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:13.380
Lucky Lincoln trails well behind,

01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:15.660
five lengths behind the rest
of the pack.

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:37.783
You all right, hon?

01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:42.071
No, I'm not.

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:44.462
You must think I'm not
a very serious person, Vinny.

01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:46.660
You have no right to be here.

01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:48.140
You find anything good?

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:51.300
No, some old jewelry. Not worth much.

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:54.340
That's my wife's, you son of a bitch.

01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:55.871
You owe me money.

01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:01.620
Come on, Vinny!

01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:04.980
Why do you always
have to do things the hard way?

01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:06.700
It's more interesting.

01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:08.380
And a lot more painful.

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:12.346
All right, let's do.

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:15.140
Son of a bitch is crazy.

01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:18.423
Don't kill him,
but bring him close to it.

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:21.386
What the... Oh!

01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:26.949
What are you doing, old man?

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:29.260
He's dying, dude.

01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:31.383
No, he's not. He's...

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:41.670
Don't touch nothing, let's just go.

01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:43.585
Let's just go.

01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:27.424
Vin?

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:30.425
Vin?

01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:36.980
Vin, it's Maggie.

01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:38.900
We're gonna put you in this machine,

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.940
and we're gonna take some tests,
and it's not gonna hurt a bit.

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:43.221
He can't understand you, Maggie.

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:49.987
OK, there he is. There he is. OK.
It's just gonna be a couple minutes.

01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:15.580
Hey, there's my brave little man.

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:18.700
Is he OK? I thought he was dead.

01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:20.180
He was just lying there.

01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:22.580
Yeah, that's what it looks like.

01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:25.300
Well, he looks like that
when he's drunk, too, so...

01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:28.660
I don't even know
what you're doing anymore.

01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:32.460
I know what I'm doing, and your father's
gonna have a field day with this.

01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:35.180
I wouldn't be here instead of with you
if it wasn't for him,

01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:37.260
- yet I'm gonna get...
- Mom. Mom. We're doing good.

01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:40.140
You're working hard every day,
and we need the money.

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:41.660
It's all right.

01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:43.703
OK.

01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:48.142
What's wrong with him, anyway?

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:53.584
Think he's had a stroke.

01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:58.900
Slowly.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.540
Down, down, down, down, down.

01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:02.185
Good, good, bend the knees.

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:05.587
Flat back. Good, good.

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:07.550
Bend the knees. Little bit, little bit.

01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:09.740
All right, all right, good.

01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:11.660
I chose Saint William of Rochester,

01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:14.380
the patron saint of adopted children.

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:16.260
It's a pretty interesting story.

01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:18.827
All the other saints
I looked at were all so...

01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:20.900
saintly, I guess.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.980
What does saintly mean to you?

01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:24.540
I don't know.

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:27.140
I don't really believe in saints
and all that.

01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:29.900
I feel like Saint William
just got to be a saint

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.940
'cause he was killed
by the boy he adopted.

01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:35.660
These days, people get killed
all the time,

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:37.740
and they don't get to be a saint for it.

01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:39.942
All right, well, thanks, Oliver.

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:43.940
Despite young Oliver's resistance,

01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:48.460
I do happen to believe that there are
saints all around us today.

01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:51.500
They may never be considered
as such by religion,

01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:54.580
but they are just as important
as the ones in your textbooks.

01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:59.580
Thus, you are going to research
someone you know, or know of,

01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:03.990
and determine if they have
the qualities fit for sainthood.

01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:09.500
Where is he? His car is here.

01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:11.020
He's in the hospital.

01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:13.140
For what?

01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:15.547
So, how do you and Vincent
know each other?

01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:18.460
I'm working for this man.

01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:20.583
Oh, doing what?

01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:23.703
Working.

01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:25.786
I'm also dancer.

01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:30.864
Wow, that... sounds exciting.

01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:34.900
Try to sound it out.

01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:39.183
Not quite.

01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:41.184
Well, you didn't lose
your sense of humor.

01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:44.700
Hey, Vincent, you've got some visitors.

01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:46.540
I stay five minutes only.

01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:48.940
Hospital is shit place.

01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:50.744
You look a lot better, Vin.

01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:53.789
Get this...

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:57.380
dipshit out of here.

01:07:57.480 --> 01:07:58.866
What'd you say?

01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:03.540
Get...

01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:05.663
Get this...

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:08.390
All right.

01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:13.500
How about we just
give Vin some time to do his therapy?

01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:15.020
Thank you. We'll be about an hour.

01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:16.700
Go to hell!

01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:19.540
- An hour.
- Maybe less.

01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:22.180
Why you so mean?
You could stop breathing.

01:08:22.279 --> 01:08:24.420
- Asshole.
- OK, how about we get...

01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:26.420
Hey, we're getting a snack.
Want a snack?

01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:29.145
- Yes, I'm starving.
- Let's get a snack.

01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:34.899
You know, they do think that his muscles
in his mouth will respond to therapy,

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.300
so that's good.

01:08:36.399 --> 01:08:39.819
- He sounds...
- Like the retard.

01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:42.340
Well, he's stupid man anyway.

01:08:42.439 --> 01:08:44.819
So the retard is not far from.

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:46.859
Do you have dollar?

01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:49.631
I'm starving. I ate nothing today.

01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:54.661
Yeah, I probably have... something.

01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:00.264
Maybe dollar-half is better.

01:09:02.279 --> 01:09:03.745
All right.

01:09:10.359 --> 01:09:12.420
Is that Vin's...

01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:14.100
- Baby?
- Yeah.

01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:16.779
I like to stay away
from the whole situation.

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:21.779
It's not polite to ask a woman
if she's pregnant.

01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:25.340
Well, I think it's pretty obvious
that she's pregnant.

01:09:25.439 --> 01:09:28.220
Vin's, like, 90-something, Mom.
That would be inappropriate.

01:09:28.319 --> 01:09:30.420
Hey, if you hit this machine
as first candy drops,

01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:33.620
you can get two to come down.
It's good, no?

01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:35.743
Thank you.

01:09:39.439 --> 01:09:41.144
Oh, OK.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.988
Hold on second.

01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:59.102
Don't eat fast, stupid cat.

01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:02.104
I...

01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:07.310
I want fresh crap.

01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:11.660
Crab.

01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:13.820
Not crap.

01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:16.740
Crab.

01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:19.022
Not crap.

01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:43.820
OK.

01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:45.670
Money.

01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:50.026
No, it's a... it's a T.

01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:53.300
- Tree. Tree.
- You owe me money.

01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:55.741
- It's a tree. All right.
- Yeah, you broke my tree.

01:10:56.240 --> 01:10:58.786
- I know.
- Yeah, you broke my fence, too.

01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:02.460
OK, what, are you planting these?

01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:04.180
Here, this should be familiar.

01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:05.660
Cactus.

01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:08.300
No, prick.

01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:10.264
Big prick.

01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:41.903
Wonderful, wonderful.

01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:51.270
Daka...

01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:54.309
is beautiful.

01:11:56.680 --> 01:12:01.060
I know you just want special massage
or something, a dance later.

01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:04.821
Don't try charming. It doesn't work.

01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:09.660
Don't worry, OK?

01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:11.703
It's going to get better.

01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:22.191
Still there?

01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:26.949
- Wait.
- Sucker!

01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:34.741
Down the stretch they come!

01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:40.469
I'm sorry.

01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:04.111
Where's... all my dirt?

01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:23.546
My name's Regina.

01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:26.226
Keep clean this house.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.340
What's all that?

01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:31.500
Vegetables.

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:33.270
Get out of that!

01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:36.748
You don't know this, vegetables?

01:13:38.454 --> 01:13:40.108
I do, but...

01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:44.180
I don't eat them.

01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:48.620
You do now. And you pay me
for the hours now, Papa, OK?

01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:50.940
What... for?

01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:52.540
I take care of you.

01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:55.500
And we don't bump the ugly parts
no more, OK? So don't ask.

01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:57.300
You're too old for this.

01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:59.300
And I'm too fat.

01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:01.660
$15 for the hours.

01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:03.828
Plus room and food.

01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:06.463
I'll get my secret pickles.

01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:10.308
OK.

01:14:11.255 --> 01:14:13.181
Who is Vincent MacKenna?

01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:16.220
- You know him?
- Yes, he's my neighbor.

01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:18.260
And he sometimes watches Oliver.

01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:20.900
Your Honor, he's my client's neighbor.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.660
He occasionally watches Oliver,
sometimes.

01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:25.350
He's your babysitter?

01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:28.620
Yeah, I mean, sort of.

01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:30.340
I pay him.

01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:33.660
Oliver, you know, goes over there
for a few hours after school

01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:35.300
when I'm still at work.

01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:38.580
He's the babysitter, Your Honor,
of sorts. A paid position.

01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:39.940
May I ask why this is relevant?

01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:42.180
Is your client aware that Mr. MacKenna

01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:45.740
takes her son to the racetrack,
and they gamble?

01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:48.227
He also takes him to a local bar.

01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:52.700
We went to the horses a few times.

01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:54.789
A few times? Was that fun?

01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:57.471
- Well, a little.
- Yeah, good.

01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:03.820
This is completely news to me.
I've never heard this before.

01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:06.500
My client is unaware of these events,
as am I,

01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:10.220
which is a big surprise right now.

01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:13.100
I'll bet there are quite a few surprises
in this folder, then.

01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:15.667
- Oh, God.
- Daka Parimova?

01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:18.988
Are you aware of her occupation?

01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:22.300
She works for Vin.

01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:24.468
She works for Vince, right?

01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:30.300
- She's a lady of the night.
- What?

01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:32.309
Do you know what that means?

01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:34.949
She works at night?

01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:43.300
She may be a prostitute.

01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:50.060
Your Honor, I need a few minutes to...
confer with my client.

01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:51.910
I imagine you do.

01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:57.660
I guess gambling and a racetrack
is like a math class?

01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:00.020
- You got to learn how to bet?
- The odds.

01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:03.060
The bar. Guess that could fall
under current events, right?

01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:05.262
More like social studies.

01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:10.708
It's the strip club hooker
that I can't seem to get my head around.

01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:13.031
Commerce?

01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:14.781
Biology?

01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:18.351
Just stop talking. Don't talk.

01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:26.389
Vin!

01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:29.421
Vin!

01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:36.500
Why do you people think
my people can't hear?

01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:40.260
What kind of a man takes a child
to a bar and to the racetrack?

01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:43.460
And has him hanging out
with a prostitute?

01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:45.420
What kind of mother

01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:47.820
lets her son hang out

01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:51.100
with a man l-l-l-like that?

01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:53.140
You're an asshole, Vin.

01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:56.620
50-50 custody with his asshole dad,
and I have you to thank for that.

01:16:56.720 --> 01:17:02.100
You have no one
but yourself to blame for that.

01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:04.143
He needs more than...

01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:07.864
a deadbeat mother.

01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:12.260
Good one, and maybe I deserve that.

01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:14.500
I don't know what I was thinking
letting him hang out with you.

01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:16.700
My sentiments exactly.

01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:19.660
Well, he's not coming over there
anymore. That's a given.

01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:22.540
I'll get you your money
for your stupid tree.

01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:24.780
There'll be some interest.

01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:26.311
Yeah, good luck with that.

01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:30.823
Oh, I'm sorry! Sorry!

01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:35.380
My reaction time is much slower
these days.

01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:37.070
Yeah, you were never fast, just stupid.

01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:50.064
You have seven new messages.

01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:55.980
Hello, Vin.
This is Ana here at Sunnyside.

01:17:56.080 --> 01:18:00.500
I'm afraid we have some bad
news regarding your wife, Sandy, sir.

01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:03.385
Please call us as soon as you get this.

01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:10.860
Vin, hello, it's Ana again at Sunnyside.

01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:13.900
We haven't heard back from you
regarding Sandy.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.626
Please call us right away.

01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:25.620
Vincent, we've left a few messages
for you. We haven't heard back.

01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:27.460
We really need to hear from you
about Sandy.

01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:29.583
Please call or come by
as soon as possible.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:44.700
Feeling OK?

01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:47.380
- It's a bit chilly.
- Yes, it is.

01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:01.420
OK.

01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:03.190
Here we go, Vin.

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:07.305
All of Sandy's personal items
are in there.

01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:11.820
My wife, where is she?

01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:14.060
She died, Vin.

01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:16.220
I know that.

01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:17.940
Where is she?

01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:20.029
She's in there.

01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:23.980
Where?

01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:26.060
In the box.

01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:27.705
Her remains, Vin.

01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:32.420
She died a few weeks ago.

01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:34.660
We tried contacting you several times.

01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:36.540
And when we didn't hear back from you,

01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:39.260
we decided to go ahead
with your death directives.

01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:40.541
You wanted her cremated.

01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:44.220
She's in that box?

01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:47.660
Her remains are, Vin, yes.

01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:51.182
In a box inside that box.

01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:55.543
I am sorry for your loss, Vin.

01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:04.180
This place is peace.

01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:09.748
It... w-w-w-was.

01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:20.820
Nah, I didn't study. I never study.

01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:22.590
- OK, see you later.
- See you around, man.

01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:24.420
- All right.
- Later, Oliver.

01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:26.380
- Hey, you got a lot of homework?
- Hey.

01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:28.100
Art, some math.

01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:29.381
OK.

01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:32.660
Is she with us?

01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:36.140
Yeah, she's your father's idea
of safer child care.

01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:37.300
What's her name?

01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:38.980
You have a voice, you ask her.

01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:40.740
Excuse me, what's your name?

01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:42.100
Amelda.

01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:43.580
Hi, Amelda.

01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:44.900
Hola, Mr. Oliver.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:46.580
Is she every day?

01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:49.500
And every other weekend
when you're gonna go to your dad's.

01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:50.980
That's what it's gonna be now, bub.

01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:53.660
You're gonna get shuffled back
and forth between me and him.

01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:57.140
Well, he is my dad.

01:20:57.240 --> 01:21:01.260
I know he cheated on you
a bunch of times, and...

01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:02.740
that's why we left him.

01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:05.102
Really?

01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:08.220
How do you know that?

01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:09.820
You'll tell anybody who'll listen.

01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:12.620
Grandma, Aunt Judy, all the cousins.

01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:14.948
It's also your Facebook status.

01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:20.390
I know. I've been meaning
to change that.

01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:23.500
I should just say I'm single.

01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:25.190
Yeah, that's better.

01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:37.271
Hey, Vin.

01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:39.940
M-My replacement?

01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:41.660
Yeah, I guess so.

01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:46.940
I'd hate to have to report your mother
to immigration and Natur...

01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:48.551
I am a citizen.

01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:54.024
Mr. Oliver, one minute.

01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:57.140
What's in the box?

01:21:57.240 --> 01:21:59.308
My wife.

01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:02.220
She died?

01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:03.940
No.

01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:05.260
Sh...

01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:06.900
She shrunk herself.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:08.943
She's living in there now.

01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:11.151
Rent-free.

01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:15.630
Sorry, Vin, for your loss.

01:22:16.854 --> 01:22:18.744
Never understood...

01:22:19.300 --> 01:22:22.986
wh-wh-why people say that.

01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:26.220
They don't know what else to say.

01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:29.620
How about, "What was she like?

01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:34.269
Do you miss her?"
Or "What are you gonna do now?"

01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:39.860
Do yourself a favor.

01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:42.260
Get a life.

01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:44.906
Stop living mine.

01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:49.180
Take my word.

01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:52.020
It's not working for shit for me.

01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:54.260
That's not true.

01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:56.462
What the he...

01:22:58.040 --> 01:23:00.063
hell do you know about me?

01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:04.547
You don't know me.

01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:07.548
You're just stupid.

01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:12.781
Of course I'm stupid.

01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:16.060
Mostly for thinking

01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:20.424
you're more than just
a drunk, mean old man.

01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:23.861
Guess that's goodbye.

01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:30.060
You're a sad...

01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:32.149
sad man.

01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:49.629
I loved you to the moon there, Sandy.

01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:53.223
I loved you to the moon.

01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:55.020
All right, two weeks.

01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:57.260
Two weeks to
our Saints Among Us assembly.

01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:03.100
The grand culmination of your sizable
efforts on one great stage.

01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:06.660
Don't forget to invite your parents,
significant others, et cetera.

01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:09.460
Wives, girlfriends,
and enjoy yourselves.

01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:12.820
And no expletives in your presentation,
please, Ocinski.

01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:15.500
He doesn't like Ocinski,
Brother Geraghty, never has.

01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:18.144
The name's Robert, sir.

01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:33.940
He didn't tell you he was a soldier?

01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:35.380
No, sir.

01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:38.789
A sergeant major, of all things.
He's famous.

01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:43.660
But it's too expensive.

01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:45.660
I don't know how to buy this crib

01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:49.260
that looks nice
and is cheap enough. I...

01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:51.500
Oh, this one? This is good.

01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:53.060
Ma'am, I'm sorry,
this is the wrong price.

01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:54.380
I like this.

01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:55.860
No, no, no, I like this.

01:25:55.960 --> 01:25:57.860
- This is great. I love this.
- I take it.

01:25:57.960 --> 01:25:59.420
- This is fantastic.
- Can we get this?

01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:00.580
We can afford this.

01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:02.180
- Ma'am...
- This is nice.

01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:03.700
I like this. I want this.

01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:04.940
This is great.

01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:06.471
OK, I'll take it.

01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:16.180
That's the old guy?

01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:18.340
Yeah, he was in Vietnam.

01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:19.620
Did I study the states?

01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:20.940
It's a country.

01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:23.420
States are inside countries.

01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:26.460
"Do not place items
with string around child's neck,

01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:29.140
such as hoods strings or pacifier cords.

01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:31.820
Strings can cause strangulation."

01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:34.420
I don't want this crib.

01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:41.907
Hey, Dad.

01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:44.340
- Good day?
- Yeah.

01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:45.980
All right, seat belt, please.

01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:49.300
How long has Vin
been doing Sandy's laundry?

01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:52.980
Oh, geez, every week for eight years.

01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:54.540
That's a long time.

01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:56.260
It is a long time.

01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:58.269
He's a good guy, Vin.

01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:09.180
What's Vin like when I'm not around?

01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:10.860
He don't like people.

01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:12.700
People don't like him.

01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:14.900
Except cat and you.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:16.340
Why you like him?

01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:27.100
That'll be straight.

01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:32.823
Oliver, come on!

01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:36.869
Breakfast is ready!

01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:39.149
Gonna get cold!

01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:42.466
Let's go!

01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:49.940
- Hi, Mom.
- Don't look so surprised. Sit down.

01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:53.462
You need some fuel
for your big day, right? Sit.

01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:56.100
- You made all this?
- Yes, I made it all.

01:27:56.200 --> 01:27:57.300
I know how to cook.

01:27:57.400 --> 01:27:58.540
I took the day off.

01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:01.860
- Thanks.
- Well, you're welcome, bub.

01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:03.940
This giving you trouble?

01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:05.949
Come here, I'll show you the trick.

01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:08.589
You got to pop this up.

01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:12.540
OK.

01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:15.266
Like that, it's like magic.

01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:17.420
I love you, Mom.

01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:20.550
Me, too.

01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:22.220
Sit down.

01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:24.070
OK, coffee or juice?

01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:27.062
- Latte?
- Nice try.

01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:39.740
Oh! My water is broken!

01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:41.180
Call a plumber.

01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:42.825
Let's go.

01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:45.141
Get up!

01:28:57.480 --> 01:28:59.940
Hello. Sit down, children, thank you.

01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:03.140
Good morning. Welcome to
our Saints Among Us assembly

01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:04.940
here at St. Patrick.

01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:08.500
And the children have been working very
hard, and it'll be interesting to see

01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:10.980
which parents they have chosen
as saints.

01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:12.540
I'm sure you're all very nervous.

01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:17.621
Our first speaker is Keesha Demorcy.

01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:26.220
For my real-life saint,

01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:28.900
I picked Mother Teresa of Calcutta.

01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:35.590
- OK, OK.
- Stop anywhere! Anywhere!

01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:41.106
When will you become like man?

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.060
Jesus, my manhood!

01:29:48.160 --> 01:29:50.786
Saint Nicholas of Sunnyside, everybody.

01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:57.020
All right, next up we have
Oliver Bronstein.

01:29:57.120 --> 01:29:59.220
Oliver Bronstein.

01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:08.580
Saints are human beings
we celebrate for their commitment

01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:10.740
and dedication to other human beings.

01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:14.340
Brother Geraghty, circa around March.

01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:22.580
This isn't the hospital.

01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:26.387
So now you are rocket surgeon.
Come on, get inside.

01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:28.380
For my modern day saint,

01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:30.860
I chose a man who shares
many of the same qualities

01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:32.740
as Saint William of Rochester.

01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:35.620
On the surface, one might think my saint

01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:38.260
is the least likely candidate
for sainthood.

01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:40.460
He's not a happy person.

01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:44.260
He doesn't like people,
and not many people like him.

01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:46.220
He's grumpy, angry,

01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:48.741
mad at the world,
and I'm sure full of regrets.

01:30:50.120 --> 01:30:51.860
He drinks too much, smokes.

01:30:51.960 --> 01:30:54.460
He gambles, curses, lies and cheats.

01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:57.630
And he spends a lot of time
with a lady of the night.

01:30:59.960 --> 01:31:03.900
- That's what you see at first glance.
- After you.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.501
If you dig deeper, you'll see
a man beyond his flaws.

01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:11.340
Mr. Vincent MacKenna was born in 1946

01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:13.020
in Sheepshead Bay,

01:31:13.120 --> 01:31:16.144
the son of first-generation
Irish immigrants.

01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:20.940
Growing up poor
on the streets of Brooklyn,

01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:24.260
Vincent learned all the things
that kids shouldn't need to know:

01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:27.860
fighting, cursing and gambling.

01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:32.860
In 1965, as a member of the
United States Army's Fifth Regiment,

01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:35.900
Vincent was among the 450 soldiers

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:39.220
dropped into the La Drang Valley
and immediately ambushed

01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:41.020
by 2,000 enemy troops.

01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:44.860
There he heroically saved the lives
of two wounded officers

01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:48.780
pinned down by enemy fire
and carried them to safety.

01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:52.540
He was awarded the Bronze Star
for his bravery.

01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:54.420
I imagine the best way I can tell you

01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:56.260
who Mr. Vincent MacKenna is

01:31:56.360 --> 01:31:59.500
is to tell you what he's done for me.

01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:02.700
When me and my mom first moved here,
we knew no one,

01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:06.460
and Mr. MacKenna took me in
when he didn't have to,

01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:08.300
and most likely didn't want to.

01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:11.231
But he did it anyhow,
'cause that's what saints do.

01:32:12.920 --> 01:32:16.980
We visited his wife, Sandy,
of 40 years, who recently passed away.

01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:20.420
Vin's done her laundry every week
for the past eight years,

01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:22.380
long after she no longer recognized him.

01:32:22.480 --> 01:32:25.340
Because saints never give up.

01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:26.980
He taught me how to fight,

01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:29.060
how to stand my ground and be brave,

01:32:29.160 --> 01:32:31.180
how to speak up and be bold.

01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:33.780
Because saints fight
for themselves and others,

01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:35.780
so that they might be heard.

01:32:35.880 --> 01:32:38.540
He taught me how to gamble,
horse racing,

01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:40.620
Keno, the over and under,

01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:43.740
which is a big reason
why I'm grounded till I'm 18.

01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:48.660
But in that, I learned how to take risks

01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:49.940
and go for broke.

01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:53.700
Because in life,
the odds can be stacked against you.

01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:55.540
This is Vin's cat, Felix,

01:32:55.640 --> 01:32:58.580
who eats gourmet cat food
while Vin eats sardines.

01:32:58.680 --> 01:33:02.260
'Cause saints make sacrifices.

01:33:02.360 --> 01:33:04.620
Yes, Mr. Vincent MacKenna is flawed,

01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:09.220
seriously flawed, but just like
all the other saints we studied.

01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:12.420
Because after all,
saints are human beings,

01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:14.380
very human beings.

01:33:14.480 --> 01:33:17.300
Courage, sacrifice,
compassion, humanity.

01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:19.460
These are the markings of a saint,

01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:22.620
and what makes Mr. Vincent MacKenna
not so far removed

01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:24.580
from Saint William of Rochester.

01:33:24.680 --> 01:33:27.820
And with that, I'd like to present
my friend and babysitter,

01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:30.580
Mr. Vincent MacKenna, for sainthood,

01:33:30.680 --> 01:33:32.540
and hereby proclaim him

01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:35.710
St. Vincent of Sheepshead Bay.

01:34:21.648 --> 01:34:23.382
Thank you, sir.

01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:25.831
Thank you, kid.

01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:44.225
Saint Vincent of Sheepshead Bay.

01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:49.580
All right, I got it.
I owe you money anyhow.

01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:51.191
- Thanks.
- What are you looking at?

01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:54.540
- Hard pretzels.
- That's just what I was looking at.

01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:57.420
If you do it just right,

01:34:57.520 --> 01:34:59.300
you can end up with...

01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:02.390
two... for the price of one.

01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:04.420
Pretty cool.

01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:06.180
That's pretty good, kiddo.

01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:08.420
I might have to adopt that.

01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:10.740
Mr. MacKenna, it's about that time.

01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:12.430
All right, hold your horses.

01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:15.588
Although, technically, that's stealing.

01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:26.980
Oh, it's OK, it's OK. Don't cry.

01:35:27.080 --> 01:35:28.820
It's OK.

01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:30.060
So what is it?

01:35:30.160 --> 01:35:33.260
Black, white, ugly?

01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:34.780
Get out of here.

01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:37.108
I like this baby.

01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:41.302
Do you like this baby?

01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:44.020
Yeah, so far.

01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:46.951
I'm so happy.

01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:55.260
I'll teach you someday.

01:35:55.360 --> 01:35:56.660
- You'll like it.
- Boys, come on.

01:35:56.760 --> 01:35:59.140
It's not Russian, but... Oh, sorry, cat.

01:35:59.240 --> 01:36:00.380
OK, you must eat vegetables.

01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:02.500
It's colorful.

01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:03.700
I'll say that.

01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:06.380
- I like the green beans.
- You do?

01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:09.340
Yeah, I don't think you ever get
enough spaghetti and green beans.

01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:11.300
My mom makes them out of a can.

01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:12.740
That's how your brain got stilted.

01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:14.860
Oh, you have stilted brain.

01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:17.300
- That's probably good.
- Like the retard.

01:36:17.400 --> 01:36:19.180
Hey, the "R" word's not cool.

01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:21.020
It's not politically correct.

01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:23.260
- Why is this?
- It's like when you say "midget."

01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:24.900
"Midget"?

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:26.704
Why not "midget"?

01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:30.187
This food beats hunger.

01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:32.865
By a hair.

01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:36.700
Don't you want to say something?

01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:37.860
Like what?

01:36:37.960 --> 01:36:40.381
Like a blessing or a prayer?

01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:52.900
No, I'd better not.

01:36:58.040 --> 01:37:00.220
Baby is hungry.

01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:03.185
All this delicious food,
and where's yours?

01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:08.309
It's not fair for everyone
to have a big meal except you?

01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:10.740
Oh!

01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:14.220
Hey, wow, it's chill...

01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:15.945
it's getting chilly in here.

01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:31.420
<i>One of toil and blood</i>

01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:33.580
<i>When blackness was a virtue</i>

01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:35.623
<i>The road was full of mud</i>

01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:38.060
<i>Came in from the wilderness</i>

01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:40.060
<i>A creature void of form</i>

01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:42.580
<i>Come in, she said, I'll give you</i>

01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:44.703
<i>Shelter from the storm</i>

01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:55.420
<i>Pass this way again</i>

01:37:55.520 --> 01:37:57.065
<i>You can rest assured</i>

01:37:57.920 --> 01:37:59.620
<i>I'll always do my best for her</i>

01:37:59.720 --> 01:38:01.540
<i>On that I give my word</i>

01:38:01.640 --> 01:38:04.740
I smell the cigarette, asshole!

01:38:04.840 --> 01:38:06.540
<i>Fight to be won</i>

01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:08.740
<i>Come in, she said, I'll give you</i>

01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:10.430
<i>Shelter from the storm</i>

01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:17.340
<i>Not a word was spoke between us</i>

01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:20.020
<i>There was little risk involved</i>

01:38:20.120 --> 01:38:21.700
<i>Everything up to that point</i>

01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:24.420
<i>Had been left unresolved</i>

01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:26.620
<i>Try imagining a place</i>

01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:28.740
<i>Where it's always safe and warm</i>

01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:30.740
<i>Come in, she said, I'll give you</i>

01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:32.863
<i>Shelter from the storm</i>

01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:45.340
<i>I was burned out from exhaustion</i>

01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:47.020
<i>Buried in the hay</i>

01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:48.860
<i>Poisoned in the bushes</i>

01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:51.300
<i>And blown out on the trail</i>

01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:53.380
<i>Hunted like a crocodile</i>

01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:56.020
<i>Ravaged in the corn</i>

01:38:56.120 --> 01:38:58.180
<i>Come in, she said, I'll give you</i>

01:38:58.280 --> 01:39:00.542
<i>Shelter from the storm</i>

01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:10.300
<i>Suddenly I turned around</i>

01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:12.540
<i>And she was standing there</i>

01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:14.940
<i>With silver bracelets on her wrists</i>

01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:17.060
<i>And flowers in her hair</i>

01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:19.340
<i>She walked up to me so gracefully</i>

01:39:19.440 --> 01:39:21.580
<i>And took my crown of thorns</i>

01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:23.620
<i>Come in, she said, I'll give you</i>

01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:26.061
<i>Shelter from the storm</i>

01:39:33.680 --> 01:39:35.260
<i>Now there's a wall between us</i>

01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:37.300
<i>Something has been lost</i>

01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:39.900
<i>I took too much for granted</i>

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:41.540
<i>I got my signals crossed</i>

01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:44.140
<i>Just to think it all began</i>

01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:46.980
<i>On a non-eventful morn</i>

01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:49.380
<i>Come in, she said, I'll give you</i>

01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:51.389
<i>Shelter from the storm</i>

01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:01.820
<i>Well, the deputy walks on hard nails</i>

01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:03.780
<i>And the preacher rides a mount</i>

01:40:03.880 --> 01:40:05.940
<i>But nothing really matters much</i>

01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:07.620
<i>It's doom alone that counts</i>

01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:09.420
<i>And the one-eyed undertaker</i>

01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:12.300
<i>He blows a futile horn</i>

01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:13.940
<i>Come in, she said, I'll give you</i>

01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:16.427
<i>Shelter from the storm</i>

01:40:24.360 --> 01:40:27.740
<i>I've heard newborn babies wailing</i>

01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:29.660
<i>Like a morning dove</i>

01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:31.700
<i>And old men with broken teeth</i>

01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:33.740
<i>Stranded without love</i>

01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:35.580
<i>Do I understand your question, man</i>

01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:37.300
<i>Is it hopeless, forlorn</i>

01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:39.820
<i>Come in, she said, I'll give you</i>

01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:42.546
<i>Shelter from the storm</i>

01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:52.220
<i>In a little hilltop village</i>

01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:54.420
<i>They gambled for my clothes</i>

01:40:54.520 --> 01:40:56.420
<i>I bargained for salvation</i>

01:40:56.520 --> 01:40:58.540
<i>And they gave me a lethal dose</i>

01:40:58.640 --> 01:41:01.180
<i>I offered up my innocence</i>

01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:03.220
<i>And got repaid with scorn</i>

01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:05.180
<i>Come in, she said, I'll give you</i>

01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:07.667
<i>Shelter from the storm</i>

01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:17.580
<i>Well, I'm living in a foreign country</i>

01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:20.780
<i>But I'm bound to cross the line</i>

01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:22.660
<i>Beauty walks on razor's edge</i>

01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:25.220
<i>Someday I'll make it mine</i>

01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:27.060
<i>If I could only turn back the clock</i>

01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:28.900
<i>To when God and her were born</i>

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:30.386
<i>Come in, she said, I'll give you</i>

01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:33.231
<i>Shelter from the storm</i>

01:41:34.305 --> 01:41:40.762
