01:16.200 --> 01:21.433
Okay. Time for breakfast.

01:23.200 --> 01:26.112
It's one for you...

01:26.320 --> 01:29.949
...one for you, and one for me.

01:30.160 --> 01:32.754
I got an orange star.

01:32.960 --> 01:36.350
Hey, my yellow moon's
nothing to scoff at.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.073
- No milk?
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

01:41.280 --> 01:45.796
What is breakfast
without some nice, cold milk?

01:49.640 --> 01:51.312
Milk residue.

01:52.080 --> 01:53.308
Why hold back?

01:53.520 --> 01:57.957
Breakfast is the most
important meal of the day.

01:58.160 --> 02:00.515
Let us give thanks.

02:03.560 --> 02:06.120
The pancakes, eggs and steak
were delicious.

02:06.320 --> 02:07.799
But I couldn't finish my bacon.

02:10.880 --> 02:13.678
Yours looks delicious.

02:15.280 --> 02:20.274
You know, it's really a shame to waste
this nice, beautiful piece of bacon.

02:20.480 --> 02:23.552
I love you both so much
I'm not sure who to give it to.

02:23.760 --> 02:26.911
- Please, Peg, give it to me. Please.
- Give it to me. Me. Me.

02:27.120 --> 02:30.829
I know who I love the best.

02:33.640 --> 02:35.949
Come here, baby.

02:45.920 --> 02:47.638
Well, gee, what was that for, honey?

02:47.840 --> 02:49.956
I want that damn bacon.

02:50.840 --> 02:52.831
Now, open your mouth. I'm going in.

02:54.040 --> 02:56.554
- It's mine, now.
- No, it's magically delicious, Daddy.

02:56.760 --> 02:58.478
It's lucky. I need luck. I'm starving.

02:58.680 --> 03:01.433
- Yeah, but you just ate Mom's breath.
- I don't care.

03:02.120 --> 03:04.839
- Hey, breakfast.
- Bud.

03:07.640 --> 03:10.154
<i>Very nice.
I know what you're all thinking.</i>

03:10.360 --> 03:12.590
Bud got all the brains
and looks in the family.

03:12.800 --> 03:14.153
What does he need food for?

03:14.360 --> 03:15.918
Well, when I get my degree...

03:16.120 --> 03:19.874
...from an accredited
community college, I might add...

03:20.240 --> 03:22.708
...I'll be the one with the Lucky Charms,
my friends...

03:22.920 --> 03:26.708
...and I'll be eating them
out of Miss January's bra cups.

03:27.520 --> 03:29.988
Here's to the future.

03:31.400 --> 03:33.152
How many times do I
have to tell you?

03:33.360 --> 03:35.749
When you're through with the milk,
fill it up again.

03:38.280 --> 03:40.953
Did they ever find this Lindbergh kid?

03:46.480 --> 03:49.358
See, how hard is that?
Now we have milk for tomorrow.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.753
You'd starve if it wasn't for me.

03:55.640 --> 03:58.313
Did something die in here?

03:58.520 --> 04:00.715
That would be me.

04:01.280 --> 04:04.556
It's my new cologne.
My own secret little recipe.

04:04.760 --> 04:07.320
I call it A Touch of Bud.

04:08.480 --> 04:11.790
Well, if anyone knew what a touch
of Bud was, it could only be you.

04:20.079 --> 04:22.594
And nobody does it better.

04:24.880 --> 04:27.917
Sniff it, baby. Drink it in.

04:28.720 --> 04:30.199
I went to the school library...

04:30.400 --> 04:35.155
<i>...I got Vogue, Sassy, Seventeen, Lear's
and several other fine periodicals...</i>

04:35.360 --> 04:39.399
...and I cut out those
little fragrance inserts, and voilÃ .

04:39.600 --> 04:41.511
Bud, those are women's scents.

04:42.240 --> 04:45.915
That's why I feel bold,
sassy, yet feminine.

04:47.360 --> 04:49.635
This year I'm gonna get me a babe.

04:53.400 --> 04:55.356
All right now, that's enough.

04:55.560 --> 04:57.915
Soon he'll know we're laughing at him,
not with him.

05:04.600 --> 05:06.795
Why does no one believe
this year's different?

05:07.000 --> 05:09.958
Oh, come on, Bud. Every year
you come up with a different plan.

05:10.160 --> 05:12.515
And every plan ends up
with you going to the prom...

05:12.720 --> 05:15.188
...with a sweater,
putting it on the back of a chair...

05:15.400 --> 05:18.073
...and telling people,
" My date's in the bathroom. "

05:19.640 --> 05:23.872
I know that sweater. I used to see it
sitting next to him at the movies.

05:24.840 --> 05:27.832
You remember that one time he brought
the sweater home for dinner?

05:28.040 --> 05:32.431
Daddy kept getting so angry because
it wouldn't come out of the bathroom.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.399
<i>Very nice.</i>

05:38.600 --> 05:40.909
Now you two have made him feel bad.

05:41.120 --> 05:44.749
Well, all right, I'll take him out
for some ice cream.

05:44.960 --> 05:47.235
This is not a boo-boo.

05:47.840 --> 05:50.559
Ice cream won't do it.
I want a woman.

05:50.760 --> 05:54.150
And "taking him for ice cream" does
not mean going to Baskin Robbins...

05:54.360 --> 05:57.830
...letting me look at all the flavours
and then taking me home.

06:00.760 --> 06:05.595
This time maybe I'll get you some free
samples with that little plastic spoon.

06:05.800 --> 06:08.633
I want a cone, damn it.

06:09.120 --> 06:10.348
And a girl.

06:10.560 --> 06:12.869
You hear? A girl, a girl!

06:13.080 --> 06:17.119
That's right,
Bud's starting his sophomore year.

06:17.400 --> 06:19.118
<i>Then it must be time for him to say:</i>

06:19.320 --> 06:23.359
"This year's gonna be different,"
eh, Bud?

06:24.560 --> 06:26.391
It is. As God is my witness...

06:26.600 --> 06:30.115
...this year there will be
a real girl in the bathroom.

06:30.360 --> 06:33.397
And her sweater will smell
like real girl too.

06:33.600 --> 06:36.239
Not Grandma.

06:37.960 --> 06:40.713
Well, Peggy, I see that
your son is having a crisis.

06:40.920 --> 06:42.672
But do you have a second
to help me out?

06:42.880 --> 06:43.949
Sure.

06:44.160 --> 06:47.118
Would you let Al go away
on a fraternity reunion?

06:47.320 --> 06:51.233
You know, there is a question
that comes up every day.

06:51.440 --> 06:55.035
Why, so many of Al's college clubs
and professional societies...

06:55.240 --> 06:59.358
...call him up to lecture,
or just inspire the young.

06:59.560 --> 07:03.109
So when Phi Beta Crapper calls...

07:03.960 --> 07:06.076
Oh, you know what? That's right...

07:06.280 --> 07:08.635
...Al didn't go to college.

07:08.840 --> 07:10.592
What was it
you chose instead, honey?

07:10.800 --> 07:13.268
Selling shoes.

07:13.480 --> 07:15.789
And nobody does it better, baby.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.878
Except everyone else who does it.

07:19.400 --> 07:21.630
Gee, I don't regret
not having gone to college...

07:21.840 --> 07:24.434
...because after all,
then I might not have married you.

07:24.640 --> 07:26.232
Then what would've
become of me?

07:26.440 --> 07:29.671
I would probably just lived a-
An empty, meaningless existence...

07:29.880 --> 07:33.668
...ordering hookers and pizza
till I dropped dead...

07:33.880 --> 07:38.715
...with a slice in my mouth
and a greasy hooter in my hand.

07:43.760 --> 07:44.988
Hey, that's amazing.

07:45.200 --> 07:48.636
You just described the theme
of our frat reunion party.

07:48.840 --> 07:50.159
You're not going.

07:50.360 --> 07:52.669
Oh, come on, Marcie.
It's just good, clean fun.

07:52.880 --> 07:55.314
A bunch of drunken guys
looking at strippers.

07:57.720 --> 08:00.359
And thinking of our wives.

08:01.880 --> 08:03.233
Please.

08:03.440 --> 08:08.070
Save your lies for those who think
you're a natural blond.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.434
Don't you think I know anything
about fraternities?

08:12.200 --> 08:14.668
Desperate girls,
coming from everywhere...

08:14.880 --> 08:18.555
...trying anything to land a college man
before he becomes successful...

08:18.760 --> 08:22.389
...and realizes he can get
a much better and bustier girl.

08:22.600 --> 08:25.194
Not that it wasn't fun for me.

08:25.680 --> 08:28.148
Doing anything with anybody.

08:28.360 --> 08:32.558
My once demure dress
lying ripped and forgotten.

08:33.240 --> 08:35.833
As forgotten as I was
when the sun came up.

08:36.039 --> 08:39.554
Jim, you bastard!
Why don't you return my calls?

08:44.520 --> 08:48.593
That was just a composite
of other women's stories.

08:48.800 --> 08:50.916
Well, your girlfriends
are pretty accurate.

08:51.120 --> 08:56.114
There is not a girl on earth
that wouldn't do it for a fraternity guy.

08:56.320 --> 08:58.550
Oh, and then after
an incredible night...

08:58.760 --> 09:00.716
...go back to
your high school sweetheart...

09:00.920 --> 09:04.708
...tell him he's the only one
and plan the wedding.

09:07.240 --> 09:10.198
Al, I was talking about my friends.

09:10.400 --> 09:13.039
You're the only one, baby.

09:13.240 --> 09:16.152
You too, baby.

09:17.120 --> 09:18.712
All right, sure. There were girls...

09:18.920 --> 09:21.275
...but that wasn't the only part
of a fraternity.

09:21.480 --> 09:24.074
There's so much more.

09:24.280 --> 09:26.748
No, actually, that was it.

09:27.560 --> 09:30.028
That's it. That's what I'm gonna do.

09:30.240 --> 09:32.754
What? Get a picture of Mr. D'Arcy
pasted to your face...

09:32.960 --> 09:35.315
...and wear it to school?

09:36.440 --> 09:39.159
No, human hand wash.

09:40.560 --> 09:42.516
I'm gonna start me a fraternity.

09:42.720 --> 09:44.278
And not just any fraternity.

09:44.480 --> 09:47.711
The coolest fraternity
any community college has ever seen.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.512
We'll have so many college girls...

09:49.720 --> 09:52.792
...Woody Allen will
be knocking down our door.

09:55.440 --> 09:57.271
Yeah. A fraternity.

09:57.480 --> 09:59.869
And we're just gonna take
the cream of the school.

10:00.960 --> 10:03.679
Well, we're all here.

10:03.880 --> 10:05.438
Cream of the school, right, guys?

10:09.000 --> 10:11.673
I'd like to welcome all you members
to the first meeting...

10:11.880 --> 10:14.440
...of Alpha Gonna Get 'Em fraternity.

10:15.800 --> 10:17.358
<i>Remember our motto:</i>

10:17.560 --> 10:22.315
Looky, looky,
we're gonna get some nookie.

10:28.360 --> 10:33.229
We'll do good on our tests
so we'll feel some breasts.

10:33.920 --> 10:35.512
Now, if we can all join hands...

10:35.720 --> 10:38.917
...for the Alpha Gonna Get 'Em
secret salute.

10:45.160 --> 10:46.798
Honk, honk.

11:09.160 --> 11:10.593
Hi, Dad.

11:11.200 --> 11:13.270
We're having sort of
a secret ceremony here.

11:18.080 --> 11:20.992
Not secret enough, son.

11:22.560 --> 11:24.391
Now, Bud...

11:24.600 --> 11:28.513
...remember when I told you
that if you ever had any problem...

11:28.720 --> 11:31.678
...you could come
to your mother and I and talk about it?

11:32.680 --> 11:33.999
Well, now please don't.

11:37.240 --> 11:40.789
- It's a Greek thing, Dad.
- Yeah, I know all about that.

11:42.800 --> 11:45.439
The old guy knocked over
our frat table.

11:45.640 --> 11:48.359
I have seen him in
my neighbourhood convenience store...

11:48.560 --> 11:51.199
...looking at nudie magazines.

11:51.400 --> 11:56.076
He howls like a wolf
and pinches the paper bazoombas.

11:58.200 --> 12:01.476
Gee, I don't know if there's gonna be
much room for us and the babes...

12:01.680 --> 12:04.148
...with your father's car
in our frat house.

12:04.360 --> 12:09.514
Mr. President, you promised us
we would be cool in a cool place.

12:09.720 --> 12:10.948
Well, I'll tell you this.

12:11.720 --> 12:14.678
I don't feel cool, my friend.

12:14.880 --> 12:16.598
<i>I think I speak for us all when I say:</i>

12:16.800 --> 12:19.155
I feel like pulling up my pants
and going home.

12:21.880 --> 12:23.950
Maybe we should all
forget this fraternity...

12:24.160 --> 12:25.434
<i>...and do what my Dad does:</i>

12:25.640 --> 12:29.713
Stand underneath escalators
and look up the dresses of fat women.

12:31.400 --> 12:33.277
Nobody goes anywhere.

12:33.480 --> 12:36.313
You know why?
Because I'm gonna get us chicks.

12:36.520 --> 12:40.274
How? Toga party, baby.

12:40.480 --> 12:42.038
If you think we look cool now...

12:42.240 --> 12:45.277
...wait till the chicks
get a load of us in sheets.

12:45.480 --> 12:51.715
We will be as attractive to women
as my idol, the great Barry Manilow.

12:52.240 --> 12:56.153
Now, that's the spirit that made
our convenience stores great, Ahmed.

12:56.360 --> 13:01.434
Guys, you can bet your virginity this
is the last time you'll be honking air.

13:02.520 --> 13:03.748
Honk, honk.

13:03.960 --> 13:06.110
Honk, honk.

13:10.440 --> 13:12.396
So, what movie would we like to see?

13:12.600 --> 13:14.591
Why do we have to go out, Peg?

13:15.120 --> 13:16.997
Isn't it enough I know
I'm married to you?

13:17.200 --> 13:19.919
Do we have to tell the whole world?

13:20.640 --> 13:22.517
Oh, here's something
we could all enjoy.

13:22.720 --> 13:25.996
A fine foreign film
about a young Peruvian girl...

13:26.200 --> 13:30.591
...who lives in the rain forest
and dreams of having a bicycle.

13:34.400 --> 13:36.470
Any hooters?

13:42.960 --> 13:45.428
It is a Francois Lu Max film.

13:45.640 --> 13:47.517
He explores the mind.

13:47.720 --> 13:50.029
Well, I prefer
the Joseph Zipper production...

13:50.240 --> 13:53.437
<i>...of They Exploded
Out Of Their Bras.</i>

13:57.000 --> 14:01.039
Now, Marcie, you might like that one.
It's a film about women.

14:02.320 --> 14:05.756
I wanna see a movie
with Mel Gibson's butt.

14:05.960 --> 14:07.518
I want sensitivity.

14:07.720 --> 14:09.517
- I want killing.
- I want boobies.

14:10.440 --> 14:14.274
- Boobies, boobies, boobies.
- Sensitivity, sensitivity.

14:14.480 --> 14:18.712
Boobies, boobies, boobies.

14:23.560 --> 14:25.471
Hi, pumpkin.

14:26.440 --> 14:28.317
I haven't heard anybody
chant that word...

14:28.520 --> 14:30.909
...since me and my girlfriends
were standing around...

14:31.120 --> 14:33.953
...and this old guy in this Dodge
drove by and-

14:34.600 --> 14:36.511
Daddy.

14:39.680 --> 14:45.312
Well, that must have been the time
when Bud borrowed the car.

14:56.360 --> 15:00.990
<i>Hey, look, everyone,
it's Dorf on Golf.</i>

15:03.440 --> 15:05.192
How's the party going, honey?

15:06.000 --> 15:07.718
<i>Let me put this way:</i>

15:07.920 --> 15:12.994
Mom, Mrs. D'Arcy, would you guys
like to be the girls at my party?

15:13.560 --> 15:16.358
If you do go,
I won't call you Mom, okay?

15:16.560 --> 15:18.710
I'll call you Red.

15:23.160 --> 15:25.720
Well, I guess they've heard
the legends.

15:25.920 --> 15:28.753
- They might as well see the real thing.
- Yeah.

15:28.960 --> 15:32.748
Let's give them a thrill.
How bad could it be?

15:48.000 --> 15:50.275
They rejected you, huh?

15:50.760 --> 15:52.478
- How about you, Kel?
- You know what?

15:52.680 --> 15:54.796
I'd be delighted to help.

15:55.840 --> 16:00.152
Okay. For those of you who have never
actually been this close to one...

16:00.360 --> 16:02.874
...I am a girl.

16:07.240 --> 16:08.639
Indeed.

16:08.840 --> 16:13.516
Now, all girls want men,
but before you get your hopes up...

16:13.720 --> 16:15.676
...this is a man.

16:18.080 --> 16:22.517
Now, can anyone tell me
what this man has that you don't have?

16:22.720 --> 16:24.551
- Ahmed?
- Large ear lobes...

16:24.760 --> 16:29.550
...which denote an enormous
pleasure-giving masculine force?

16:31.720 --> 16:35.269
- That's one.
- What about caring and sensitivity?

16:35.480 --> 16:38.153
Not in a guy, no.

16:39.600 --> 16:42.239
Now, to continue the lesson.

16:42.440 --> 16:44.396
Man.

16:44.600 --> 16:46.113
Boys.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.309
Kel, I think that'll be
just quite enough.

16:58.520 --> 17:01.512
No. Wait. One second.
I'm not finished yet.

17:06.160 --> 17:08.958
I'm Kelly Bundy, that's my opinion.
Call me.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.758
Thank you, Kelly Bundy.

17:16.960 --> 17:20.669
As the song goes,
she goes "duh" for the money.

17:21.240 --> 17:24.117
Now, look, guys. Now, I may not know
much about girls...

17:24.319 --> 17:25.594
<i>...but I do know this much:</i>

17:25.800 --> 17:28.678
If you put on a sheet,
even one with horsies-

17:28.880 --> 17:32.759
Which, by the way, Francis,
looks just terrific on you.

17:33.160 --> 17:34.479
girls will come.

17:34.680 --> 17:36.671
They will? They will.

17:36.880 --> 17:38.552
Wait a second. I hear people now.

17:38.760 --> 17:42.389
Guys, quick, look cool,
assume honk positions.

17:46.960 --> 17:50.316
Quite a grotesque little tableau,
eh, Peg?

17:50.520 --> 17:53.432
Yes, but at least they've got
their pants up this time.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.551
Is this what your frat was like?

17:55.760 --> 17:56.988
Sure was.

17:57.200 --> 18:00.670
Except there was girls,
booze and a lot of fun.

18:02.160 --> 18:04.276
Bud, honey.

18:05.200 --> 18:06.872
I want you to look after Seven.

18:07.080 --> 18:09.275
That is, of course,
unless he'd cramp your style.

18:13.240 --> 18:15.913
Come on, let's go.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.798
Party hearty, guys.

18:39.560 --> 18:43.109
I'd love to hang with you guys,
but I got a date.

18:43.320 --> 18:45.675
Later, gators.

18:49.800 --> 18:52.553
Oh, come on, guys.
Don't be down.

18:52.760 --> 18:55.274
They say that there is a girl
for every guy.

18:55.480 --> 18:57.038
Of course, they just say that.

18:59.080 --> 19:00.877
Look, let me help you
the best I can.

19:01.680 --> 19:05.719
Guys, there's no shame in being gay.

19:11.880 --> 19:13.791
Come on, guys.
She was only kidding.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.877
If we were gay,
the food would be better...

19:16.080 --> 19:19.959
...and there'd be plenty of girls here
making us dance against our will.

19:20.440 --> 19:22.715
I am tragically disappointed.

19:22.920 --> 19:26.037
This is supposed to be a party,
but still no large heinies...

19:26.240 --> 19:29.391
...have presented themselves
to our honking hands.

19:29.600 --> 19:34.151
Yeah. I joined this fraternity
to relive my youth.

19:34.360 --> 19:38.592
Well, I am.
I wasn't getting anything then either.

19:39.640 --> 19:45.431
Why, I could've gotten more tail playing
bingo with Mom and her friends.

19:45.640 --> 19:47.232
Do they play as we speak?

19:47.440 --> 19:49.032
I have found that an old woman...

19:49.240 --> 19:52.835
...is as grateful as a small dog
when you pet it.

19:55.160 --> 19:58.357
Just let me change my clothes
and I'll give you something to pet.

20:00.880 --> 20:02.871
Not me, you ninnies.

20:03.080 --> 20:05.833
I'm talking about girls.

20:06.160 --> 20:08.116
My dad may have taken the chips...

20:08.320 --> 20:10.038
...but we still have the dip.

20:10.240 --> 20:12.993
And I'm gonna go get us
the hooters to go with it.

20:19.240 --> 20:22.550
Double word score.

20:22.760 --> 20:25.433
" NBC" is not a word.

20:27.360 --> 20:31.558
It's a word. It's just not a network.

20:35.760 --> 20:38.115
- Where is everybody?
- They went home.

20:38.320 --> 20:40.038
Ahmed and Francis were bored...

20:40.240 --> 20:43.676
...and Gus said his prostrate
was flaring up.

20:43.880 --> 20:46.997
I can't believe this.
I got girls. Great ones.

20:47.200 --> 20:49.395
But they're expecting fraternity guys.

20:49.600 --> 20:51.556
I can't lose these girls, I just can't.

20:52.160 --> 20:54.799
Oh, Bud? Where are the guys?

20:55.000 --> 20:57.275
We wanna dance.

20:58.400 --> 21:00.834
They'll be right there.

21:03.960 --> 21:07.111
And they'll be
some dancing fools too.

21:22.040 --> 21:23.598
Hey, Bud?

21:23.800 --> 21:25.392
How did you get these girls to come?

21:26.120 --> 21:29.999
I took your advice, Kel.
I told them we were gay.

21:31.560 --> 21:32.993
Did you tell Dad and Mr. D'Arcy?

21:34.120 --> 21:37.556
That's something for each man
to discover on his own.

21:47.720 --> 21:50.632
It's sweet that they found each other.

21:50.840 --> 21:52.159
I'm warning you.

21:52.360 --> 21:54.669
I'm gonna show you
all it takes is a good woman.

21:55.480 --> 21:57.471
Well, I've tried.

21:57.680 --> 22:00.672
I could never find a girl
who could excite me.

22:00.880 --> 22:04.634
Although you do, a little.

22:06.960 --> 22:09.394
Well, how can we make it a lot?

22:10.400 --> 22:13.233
I don't know. I'll think about it.
