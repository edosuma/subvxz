00:08.885 --> 00:10.512
<i>Previously on</i> Nurse <i>Jackie...</i>

00:10.595 --> 00:12.555
Dr. Roman, you might want to throw
a little stitch in there.

00:12.639 --> 00:14.432
Just looking out for your breasts... Blouse.

00:16.726 --> 00:19.813
Dr. Roman has had every bump in the road
smoothed over

00:19.896 --> 00:20.897
-because she's...
- Hot?

00:20.980 --> 00:22.023
Expecting it.

00:22.107 --> 00:24.484
Next time she's not cutting it,
say something.

00:24.567 --> 00:25.819
- Who wants morphine?
- Yeah, that's me.

00:25.902 --> 00:27.904
<i>This is a lawsuit waiting to bite my butt.</i>

00:28.029 --> 00:29.030
You're not even an employee.

00:29.114 --> 00:30.824
Which is why I have no choice

00:30.907 --> 00:32.075
but to hire you back.

00:32.242 --> 00:33.368
Who is that?

00:33.493 --> 00:36.496
New trauma guy. Some big shot army doc.

00:36.579 --> 00:40.458
I'm thinking it's time that I moved out
and got my own place.

00:40.542 --> 00:41.793
Where are you going?

00:41.876 --> 00:43.586
I want to be with my baby all the time.

00:43.920 --> 00:45.171
When are you leaving?

00:45.255 --> 00:46.506
Today's my last day.

00:46.589 --> 00:49.759
Really? The day before my birthday?

00:51.428 --> 00:52.804
See you on the outside?

00:52.887 --> 00:53.888
Charlie, this is Jackie.

00:53.972 --> 00:57.267
Listen, I am calling you
and you have to call me back.

00:57.392 --> 00:58.643
Charlie?

01:00.645 --> 01:03.314
Look, I know this isn't part of our deal,

01:03.398 --> 01:06.359
but is there any way I can get the girls
for my birthday tomorrow?

01:06.443 --> 01:07.610
I'll think about it.

01:07.819 --> 01:09.028
<i>Hey, Jackie, it's Kevin.</i>

01:09.112 --> 01:10.321
<i>I know it's your birthday tomorrow,</i>

01:10.405 --> 01:12.449
<i>but I'm gonna keep the girls.</i>

02:12.675 --> 02:15.720
Come on. We've managed to mediate
every other issue in your divorce.

02:15.845 --> 02:18.139
Can't we find a compromise
on this last one?

02:20.058 --> 02:23.061
I need primary custody. Period.

02:23.144 --> 02:24.479
Nice.

02:24.562 --> 02:26.523
Can you meet in the middle, Jackie?

02:26.606 --> 02:28.566
What about shared custody?

02:28.650 --> 02:31.569
I'll do that. Shared custody is fair.
Fair is all I want.

02:31.694 --> 02:34.364
Here's what I want.
I wanna go back in a fucking time machine

02:34.447 --> 02:35.865
before you were a drug addict,

02:35.949 --> 02:38.117
and ruined our marriage
and fucked up our kids.

02:38.201 --> 02:40.286
- That's what I want.
- Can we keep this on the issue, please?

02:40.370 --> 02:42.664
Okay. Here's my issue.

02:43.164 --> 02:44.833
Her work hours are nuts,

02:45.041 --> 02:48.795
shared custody when her schedule
is all over the place is crazy for me,

02:48.878 --> 02:50.880
and unfair to the girls.

02:50.964 --> 02:53.883
It's funny. You had no problem with my
hours when they were paying for your bar.

02:53.967 --> 02:55.343
Enough. Someone needs to give here.

02:55.552 --> 02:57.303
Kevin, Jackie has met you halfway.

02:57.387 --> 03:01.558
If she can make her hours more predictable,
would you agree to share custody?

03:02.517 --> 03:05.228
Yeah. Okay. I'll agree to it.

03:05.562 --> 03:09.649
- But if she can't fix her hours, I get primary.
- Stop.

03:09.732 --> 03:11.025
Nobody say another word.

03:12.068 --> 03:15.405
You have 24 hours to work this out
or I toss it to the judge.

03:20.368 --> 03:23.496
So, maybe you'll also change your mind
about tonight?

03:23.580 --> 03:25.206
Let me have the girls for my birthday?

03:25.874 --> 03:27.208
Sorry. it sets a precedent.

03:27.292 --> 03:30.003
A precedent? Jesus...

03:30.086 --> 03:32.839
What if I promised to have
no more birthdays?

03:32.922 --> 03:34.132
I kind of like that idea.

03:34.716 --> 03:37.468
Yeah. Good luck with that.

03:55.069 --> 03:58.031
Hey. Been a while. Good to see you back.

03:58.114 --> 04:00.617
Yeah, I missed the coffee.

04:04.287 --> 04:06.664
It's been a rough 24 hours.

04:07.707 --> 04:12.211
My best friend is leaving the country,
my ex is trying to get custody of my kids,

04:12.295 --> 04:13.630
you know, it's just a lot.

04:16.049 --> 04:18.092
Anyway, it's good to see you.

04:18.176 --> 04:21.179
- I'm gonna... I'm gonna sit down.
- Yeah.

04:21.262 --> 04:24.307
Hey, you might wanna get your hand up.

04:26.976 --> 04:32.315
If you can't see your higher power,
how do you know it's out there?

04:32.649 --> 04:35.485
Today, I prayed for a parking spot,

04:35.568 --> 04:38.947
and then when I got here,
boom, parking spot.

04:39.030 --> 04:41.866
That's how I know
my higher power is out there.

04:42.492 --> 04:44.243
It's gonna give you hope.

04:44.327 --> 04:46.746
Okay. We got time for one more share.

04:46.829 --> 04:48.331
Anybody?

04:53.461 --> 04:57.131
Okay, sweetie.
We're gonna make this all better, okay?

04:57.507 --> 04:58.841
Aren't we, Doctor?

04:58.925 --> 05:00.677
Can you tell me where it hurts?

05:00.760 --> 05:01.928
Did you check his ears?

05:02.011 --> 05:03.179
- Not yet.
- Okay.

05:03.262 --> 05:05.807
Just gonna take a little look in your ear.

05:07.016 --> 05:09.519
Just a little light. Look, see?

05:09.852 --> 05:11.312
Easy, easy, easy-

05:11.396 --> 05:13.690
- I am your doctor.
- Dr. Cooper.

05:14.357 --> 05:16.901
- Here we go.
- Let me take a quick peek.

05:17.902 --> 05:19.904
Oh, lookie there.

05:20.363 --> 05:22.490
S-P-I-D-E-R.

05:23.241 --> 05:24.617
It's gonna be okay.

05:24.701 --> 05:27.203
He's nine. He can S-P-E-L-L.

05:28.371 --> 05:32.792
I see it. And... Gone.

05:32.875 --> 05:34.752
You're actually scaring it away, Doctor.

05:34.877 --> 05:36.546
My patient, Doctor.

05:37.839 --> 05:40.466
Maybe Dr. Prentiss has another way.

05:46.431 --> 05:47.724
You're doing great, Jake.

05:47.807 --> 05:49.517
How many beers you got on the wall?

05:49.600 --> 05:52.270
I'm down to 43.

05:52.353 --> 05:55.398
Come on, Spidey, where are you?

05:55.773 --> 05:58.860
See, when bugs get lost,
they always come to the light.

05:59.318 --> 06:01.070
Kind of like people.

06:02.905 --> 06:04.866
Did you learn that serving in Iraq?

06:04.949 --> 06:08.286
No, serving in Rikers, for dealing.

06:09.829 --> 06:11.706
All right. Here we go.

06:12.915 --> 06:15.418
A curious creature.

06:15.793 --> 06:18.671
A spider emerges to investigate.

06:18.755 --> 06:21.007
Is it friend or is it foe?

06:21.382 --> 06:23.176
Got him.

06:24.802 --> 06:26.679
I'm gonna go with foe.

06:29.348 --> 06:34.020
- Good morning and may I wish you a very...
- Stop.

06:34.103 --> 06:36.522
...happy workday.

06:38.274 --> 06:39.692
Hey, what's that?

06:39.776 --> 06:42.070
Looks like our master schedule.

06:44.363 --> 06:48.034
An apt phrase I heard
might help you with your struggles.

06:48.618 --> 06:51.037
"You're only as sick as your secrets."

06:51.120 --> 06:52.205
Here's a secret.

06:52.288 --> 06:55.541
You wanna help me with my struggles?
Back off.

07:01.672 --> 07:03.382
Hannah, what's up?

07:03.466 --> 07:06.344
You missed the smell so much,
you had to come back?

07:06.427 --> 07:08.387
No, it's pretty much the people.

07:08.471 --> 07:09.764
Hi, I'm Dr. Roman.

07:09.847 --> 07:12.058
This is Hannah Cohen, a return customer.

07:12.308 --> 07:15.353
It's my lower back. it really aches.

07:15.686 --> 07:17.688
Can you roll over for me?

07:24.445 --> 07:27.073
Well, there's no swelling,

07:28.032 --> 07:32.370
but it is possible to get day-after back pain.

07:32.453 --> 07:35.873
You like, what, Vicodin? Percocet?

07:35.957 --> 07:37.208
Hey, it really does hurt.

07:38.751 --> 07:41.963
Jackie, get some film.
I'll write up a prescription.

07:44.382 --> 07:46.509
Not to worry, honey. I'll take care of you.

07:51.597 --> 07:53.349
Nothing.

07:54.517 --> 07:56.227
Unless you see anything.

07:57.979 --> 07:59.313
Maybe there's something else going on.

08:00.189 --> 08:01.774
You think?

08:01.858 --> 08:02.900
She's surfing meds.

08:03.442 --> 08:04.902
You don't know that.

08:04.986 --> 08:06.404
Hey, I go clubbing.

08:06.487 --> 08:08.447
I can so spot an addict when I see one.

08:11.075 --> 08:12.076
What?

08:13.661 --> 08:16.372
God, you're so weird.

08:27.175 --> 08:31.512
Yes, I'd like to order
some lab work for a patient.

08:31.596 --> 08:35.558
I'm Dr. Roman. Dr. Carrie Roman.

08:35.641 --> 08:38.477
When the back X-ray came up clean,
I ran urine and a blood culture.

08:38.561 --> 08:40.563
Her white count is through the roof.

08:40.646 --> 08:42.356
You're a nurse, how did you order these?

08:42.440 --> 08:44.525
Isn't this Dr. Roman's patient?

08:44.650 --> 08:46.736
This is my patient. She trusts me.

08:58.331 --> 08:59.916
She's a little tachy at 110.

08:59.999 --> 09:02.251
BP's low. 100 over 65.

09:02.335 --> 09:03.878
I should go to the hospital.

09:03.961 --> 09:06.464
You're in the hospital, sweetie.
This is Jackie.

09:06.589 --> 09:08.216
Is this rash new?

09:08.299 --> 09:11.928
- Uh, yeah.
- All right. Get her admitted to the ICU.

09:20.686 --> 09:22.563
Zoey.

09:22.647 --> 09:25.608
If they were from me, they'd be pink.

09:43.542 --> 09:46.337
You threw away a card from your dad?

09:49.131 --> 09:51.884
I wish my dad would send me flowers,

09:51.968 --> 09:54.095
but he's in prison.

09:54.178 --> 09:56.180
Enough about my dad. Tell me about yours.

09:56.264 --> 09:58.349
You have a dad?

09:58.432 --> 10:01.018
She worked here 10 years
before we even knew she had a husband.

10:01.143 --> 10:02.895
Okay. From this point on,

10:02.979 --> 10:06.190
could you all assume that I have
all the normal components of a family

10:06.274 --> 10:08.484
and they're all fucked up?

10:09.360 --> 10:11.487
You can't. It's a gift.

10:12.154 --> 10:13.656
It's a gift I don't want.

10:13.739 --> 10:17.910
Today is a gift when you're sober.
That's why we call it the present.

10:30.631 --> 10:33.968
<i>All available personnel,
please assemble in the old hallway.</i>

10:40.641 --> 10:41.934
People, people.

10:43.394 --> 10:46.439
A patient who came here to get better
got sicker.

10:46.522 --> 10:49.567
All Saints is responsible
for this patient's sepsis.

10:49.650 --> 10:53.529
Our 10th case in the last year.
It should be zero.

10:53.612 --> 10:56.032
Hand hygiene is the biggest culprit.

10:56.157 --> 10:58.617
You wash your hands, but not enough.

10:58.701 --> 11:01.871
So, I'm looking for a volunteer
who will be my

11:03.122 --> 11:06.292
-hand hygiene monitor. Zoey.
- Honored.

11:06.375 --> 11:10.171
So honored to take on this sacred mission
to save lives.

11:10.296 --> 11:12.298
Yes.

11:12.381 --> 11:15.718
Over in Landstuhl, we cultured wounds
to ID patients at risk for sepsis.

11:15.801 --> 11:17.678
I mean, maybe we can start that here.

11:17.762 --> 11:19.805
Why ask me? You're the new chief of the ER.

11:19.972 --> 11:21.015
I am?

11:26.354 --> 11:30.733
People, our new chief of the ER,
Dr. Ike Prentiss.

11:35.571 --> 11:37.323
Back to work now.

11:39.325 --> 11:40.785
What the fuck was that?

11:40.868 --> 11:42.661
First, O'Hara gets the chief job over me,

11:42.745 --> 11:46.207
she goes, and then Akalitus gives it
to some guy who started yesterday?

11:46.290 --> 11:48.417
I mean, what is it about me?

11:48.626 --> 11:49.752
Really?

11:50.961 --> 11:53.672
You know what? Screw it. I'm quitting.

11:53.756 --> 11:56.258
Why, so you can go someplace else
and have the same thing happen?

11:56.342 --> 11:59.512
You want respect? Man the fuck up.
Cut the goofy shit.

11:59.595 --> 12:00.679
What goofy shit?

12:00.763 --> 12:02.681
Two words, air pistols.

12:07.770 --> 12:08.854
Come in.

12:11.524 --> 12:12.775
How's your sepsis patient?

12:13.651 --> 12:15.778
Poor thing. Lucky she has you.

12:15.945 --> 12:17.196
Keep me posted.

12:23.119 --> 12:24.620
Is there something else?

12:24.995 --> 12:27.832
Yeah. I said I needed to talk to you.

12:28.582 --> 12:29.583
You did?

12:31.710 --> 12:33.879
Oh, right. The schedule.

12:37.925 --> 12:39.343
Well, it's not gonna work.

12:39.427 --> 12:43.305
Jackie, your schedule's fine except that
it tumbles into 10 other people's schedules.

12:43.389 --> 12:45.391
I do this for you,
I have to do it for everybody.

12:45.474 --> 12:48.060
Gloria, you understand
this is my one shot at custody.

12:48.144 --> 12:50.563
You just have to sign it.
Nobody has to know.

12:51.272 --> 12:53.149
I'm sorry. I can't.

13:07.329 --> 13:10.875
Congrats on the new promotion.

13:10.958 --> 13:14.336
And I heard how you got the bug
out of that kid's ear.

13:14.420 --> 13:16.338
I think I'm gonna learn a lot from you.

13:16.422 --> 13:17.882
Yeah, you know, I think you will.

13:17.965 --> 13:21.427
Like not dismissing a sepsis patient's
complaints as drug trolling.

13:21.510 --> 13:24.346
And to aid in your learning,
I have a job for you.

13:25.222 --> 13:30.102
We have a patient in three
who is suffering from impacted bowels.

13:30.186 --> 13:31.562
Dis-impact them.

13:38.027 --> 13:39.695
It's good to be chief.

13:41.947 --> 13:45.451
She can go all hoochie,
but the big man is saving it. Just saying.

13:46.452 --> 13:49.330
I gave those flowers away, Thor.
Bring them back.

13:49.413 --> 13:51.373
Oh, darn. He's allergic.

13:51.457 --> 13:54.960
Probably to "tacky,"
but you can enjoy them.

13:57.546 --> 14:01.050
Congratulations. Our one millionth dog bite.

14:04.094 --> 14:06.138
Freeze!

14:06.222 --> 14:07.598
Wash 'em, cowboy.

14:16.565 --> 14:18.484
I want my mom.

14:18.567 --> 14:21.070
I already called her.
She booked the next flight out.

14:25.574 --> 14:27.910
There's something
you need to know, Hannah.

14:28.244 --> 14:33.290
This is my house, and in my house,
the odds are in your favor. You got it?

14:48.639 --> 14:49.807
You paged?

14:49.890 --> 14:52.643
I have to talk to you. It's Prentiss.

14:52.726 --> 14:53.811
What about him?

14:53.894 --> 14:56.647
Bad enough he took your job away.
Now he's on my ass.

14:56.730 --> 14:57.898
He's giving me extra work.

14:57.982 --> 14:59.984
I was being so nice to him,
and then he was like,

15:00.067 --> 15:02.152
"Go give an enema to Mr..."

15:02.278 --> 15:04.238
Worthington.

15:05.114 --> 15:07.116
I'm sorry. I just...

15:07.491 --> 15:08.951
Can you...

15:12.955 --> 15:15.207
I can give him the enema for you.

15:15.291 --> 15:17.293
For real?

15:17.376 --> 15:19.253
You're so awesome.

15:23.299 --> 15:27.094
- On your side, sir.
- On your side.

15:27.177 --> 15:29.513
I feel like I'm gonna learn a lot from you.

15:33.726 --> 15:35.894
What are you doing Saturday?

15:35.978 --> 15:37.771
- Free all day. Yup.
- You are?

15:37.896 --> 15:41.400
That's... That's great.
Can you cover my shift?

15:42.359 --> 15:43.611
Sure.

15:43.694 --> 15:44.903
Oh, my God.

15:44.987 --> 15:48.657
I would so totally hug you
if your hand wasn't in his ass.

15:49.700 --> 15:51.035
Hello?

15:53.495 --> 15:55.205
Here it comes.

15:58.667 --> 16:00.878
People, I have an announcement to make.

16:02.504 --> 16:06.008
The new chief of ER will be Dr. Ike Prentiss.

16:07.384 --> 16:09.178
That is all.

16:17.144 --> 16:20.022
Gloria, here it is.

16:21.857 --> 16:23.776
What's this?

16:23.859 --> 16:25.944
These are my new hours we just worked out.

16:26.028 --> 16:28.864
You told me to bring it to you
so you could sign it.

16:30.491 --> 16:32.451
You don't remember?

16:38.540 --> 16:39.541
Hey, what's up?

16:39.625 --> 16:40.626
<i>Breaking news.</i>

16:40.709 --> 16:44.421
My hours are now officially custody friendly.

16:44.546 --> 16:47.549
<i>Akalitus signed off on a new schedule.</i>

16:49.802 --> 16:51.136
Kevin?

16:51.220 --> 16:53.055
<i>Yeah, I'm here.</i>

16:53.138 --> 16:56.350
<i>My lawyer decided to petition the court
for psychological tests on the kids.</i>

16:56.433 --> 16:58.519
<i>We're going for primary custody.</i>

17:00.020 --> 17:03.232
You... Your lawyer? We're mediating.

17:03.315 --> 17:06.318
- It's called a forensic evaluation and...
- What the <i>hell, Kevin?</i>

17:06.443 --> 17:09.154
We made a deal.
I fixed my hours like you asked me to.

17:09.238 --> 17:10.989
Now you're gonna fucking change
the rules on me?

17:11.073 --> 17:13.033
<i>You're talking to me about following rules?</i>

17:13.158 --> 17:15.244
Seriously?

17:15.327 --> 17:18.330
I never thought I'd ever find
any part of this funny.

17:38.308 --> 17:41.895
Don't take this the wrong way,
but you look like shit.

17:44.231 --> 17:47.401
Kevin wants psych tests for the girls.

17:47.484 --> 17:49.069
That sucks.

17:49.153 --> 17:50.404
And you know what?

17:50.487 --> 17:54.241
I think Kevin is engaging
in anger behavior towards you

17:54.324 --> 17:57.369
for changing the relationship dynamic
when you got sober.

17:57.453 --> 18:01.039
No, I think he's pretty much
just being an asshole.

18:01.123 --> 18:03.208
Why do you sound like a self-help book?

18:03.292 --> 18:05.836
I've been going to Al-Anon meetings.

18:07.671 --> 18:10.507
I am learning so much about you.

18:12.509 --> 18:16.013
Now I'm going to detach with love.

18:35.199 --> 18:37.493
Oh, damn it.

18:38.827 --> 18:41.789
<i>Dr. Roman, please answer your page to ICU.</i>

18:46.877 --> 18:49.004
Her sepsis is causing renal failure.

19:04.061 --> 19:07.356
Thanks for coming, Doctor,
after I've already stabilized your patient.

19:08.190 --> 19:10.400
Put the phone down, Dr. Roman.

19:26.041 --> 19:27.543
Anyone seen my phone?

19:28.961 --> 19:30.212
Jackie, did you...

19:35.425 --> 19:38.637
Yup, it's a bitch without the pills.

19:39.263 --> 19:43.225
Especially with Kevin
kicking my ass over the girls.

19:43.308 --> 19:44.893
Some birthday.

19:46.395 --> 19:47.563
Yeah, I just keep wondering

19:47.646 --> 19:50.190
when it is I'm supposed
to get to the happy part, right?

19:50.274 --> 19:52.025
Jesus Christ.

19:52.901 --> 19:55.404
I just need to get something.

20:22.055 --> 20:24.308
-Hey.
-Hey.

20:24.391 --> 20:26.685
I thought for your birthday
I'd give you a ride home.

20:27.936 --> 20:30.188
Oh, Eddie. Thanks, that's sweet.
Can I take a rain check?

20:30.272 --> 20:32.441
I've just had one of those days.

20:33.734 --> 20:35.694
Sure.

20:35.777 --> 20:37.321
You wanna talk about it?

20:37.487 --> 20:40.532
No, it's Kevin. It's custody stuff.

20:40.616 --> 20:43.285
Except, now, he wants the girls
to have psych testing.

20:44.119 --> 20:45.329
That's hardball.

20:45.996 --> 20:47.497
What the hell am I supposed to do?

20:47.998 --> 20:50.292
What can you do?

20:52.002 --> 20:56.048
Maybe I can catch somebody in psych.
Find out what this test is all about.

20:56.131 --> 20:59.384
Try Dr. Saltzman. She's the best.

20:59.468 --> 21:01.553
Tell her I sent you.

21:01.637 --> 21:05.140
And I'm around if you need anything.

21:06.850 --> 21:09.186
Now this is a nice birthday present.

21:10.270 --> 21:12.356
Just this. You and me like this.

21:13.690 --> 21:17.736
It's just... I don't even know what I'm saying.
Thank you.

21:18.946 --> 21:20.989
It's what I'm here for.

21:38.966 --> 21:40.968
Where's the lady?

21:42.719 --> 21:44.513
Change of plans.

21:49.017 --> 21:51.144
- Thanks anyway, Chief.
- All right.

22:06.785 --> 22:08.036
I thought you were working late.

22:08.829 --> 22:10.247
Surprise!

22:10.330 --> 22:13.125
-Happy birthday, Mom!
-Oh, my gosh, you guys!

22:13.208 --> 22:14.793
Oh, my...

22:14.876 --> 22:16.044
I thought you were at Dad's!

22:16.128 --> 22:17.504
We were till Zoey came over.

22:17.587 --> 22:21.091
She and Dad went for a walk
and then he said we could come see you.

22:21.174 --> 22:23.760
- We brought a pifiata and cake.
- Yeah.

22:24.886 --> 22:28.015
Live from London.

22:28.765 --> 22:30.308
<i>Surprise!</i>

22:30.684 --> 22:32.477
No way! No.

22:32.561 --> 22:35.272
<i>I missed you so much!</i>

22:35.647 --> 22:38.525
<i>Cheers, birthday girl!</i>

22:39.109 --> 22:40.736
What happened?

22:46.783 --> 22:50.162
- Yay! Got her back!
<i>- Yay!</i>

22:51.913 --> 22:53.123
Are you kidding?

22:53.206 --> 22:55.417
- Next batter. Fi, you're up.
- Strike.

22:55.667 --> 22:57.044
Give it all you got.

22:57.127 --> 22:59.755
- One, two, three...
- Two, three...

23:00.088 --> 23:02.090
Go.

23:02.174 --> 23:03.967
- Honey, nice try.
- Yeah!

23:04.051 --> 23:05.886
Show 'em how it's done.

23:05.969 --> 23:08.180
- Come on, Grace.
-It's against the ropes.

23:09.473 --> 23:11.183
<i>Yeah, come on!</i>

23:11.266 --> 23:12.684
- Very nice.
- Nice, nice.

23:12.768 --> 23:14.728
Very, very good.

23:14.811 --> 23:18.315
One shot, sweetie. You only get one.

23:53.725 --> 23:56.561
You know what I'd really like
for my birthday?

23:56.728 --> 23:58.605
How about you draw me a picture?

23:58.688 --> 24:01.024
Of what?

24:01.108 --> 24:04.402
I would love a picture of our family.

24:04.486 --> 24:06.154
Okay.

24:07.948 --> 24:09.741
Is that me or Grace?

24:09.825 --> 24:12.244
You. See the smile?

24:12.327 --> 24:15.831
Oh, yes. It's my birthday smile.

24:16.665 --> 24:20.043
- Now Daddy.
- Yes, we can't forget Daddy.

24:20.127 --> 24:22.587
But where do you think Daddy is?
Is he at work maybe?

24:22.671 --> 24:25.507
Or maybe he's at his apartment?

24:39.187 --> 24:40.772
Hey.

24:43.650 --> 24:46.987
I'm... I just wanted to say thank you
for the surprise.

24:47.112 --> 24:49.781
The nice surprise. The girls. Thank you.

24:50.740 --> 24:53.702
Enjoy 'em while you can.

24:56.663 --> 25:00.083
I got another surprise today.
You ready for this?

25:00.167 --> 25:01.793
Flowers from my father.

25:01.877 --> 25:03.461
No shit.

25:03.545 --> 25:06.256
From Hank? Jesus.

25:06.631 --> 25:08.800
It's hard growing up with just one parent.

25:09.092 --> 25:10.343
You made your bed.

25:10.427 --> 25:12.012
Come on,
can you give me a break, Kevin, please?

25:12.095 --> 25:15.098
I know you're angry at me. I'm angry at you.

25:15.182 --> 25:16.808
This is about the girls.

25:16.892 --> 25:19.811
This psych test, just a really shitty move.

25:19.978 --> 25:22.564
Grace is already filled with rage.

25:22.647 --> 25:24.941
Fi is struggling in school.
Why do you think that is?

25:25.025 --> 25:27.652
Who's sweating the test? Them or you?

25:28.653 --> 25:32.616
Look, so I talked to a child psychologist
at work to find out about this test.

25:32.699 --> 25:34.993
Do you know what she told me?

25:35.076 --> 25:38.205
They ask the kids
to draw a picture of their family

25:38.288 --> 25:40.457
and then they tell them to start erasing.

25:42.751 --> 25:46.254
So, guess what Fi
drew for me for my birthday.

25:49.382 --> 25:51.968
Take a look at this. First of all,

25:52.052 --> 25:53.803
look how little she made herself.

25:56.014 --> 25:57.641
You're only making my case.

25:57.724 --> 26:00.435
Second of all, look at you, Kev.

26:00.769 --> 26:03.230
Way over here off to the side.

26:04.272 --> 26:05.899
So I'm just saying,

26:07.275 --> 26:10.737
once these girls start erasing,

26:10.820 --> 26:12.864
who do you think is gonna go first?
