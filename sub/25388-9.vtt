WEBVTT

00:02.547 --> 00:04.114
Okay, I'm seriously intrigued.

00:04.149 --> 00:06.333
Has Christine called you
to a crime scene before?

00:06.367 --> 00:07.466
Well, it's the first time

00:07.500 --> 00:09.019
I've been officially called
to a crime scene

00:09.053 --> 00:10.388
since leaving the force.

00:10.422 --> 00:11.989
Coroner's van.

00:12.023 --> 00:14.491
- This has to be a murder case.
- Yeah, high-profile, too.

00:14.526 --> 00:16.827
The guys from Robbery-Homicide
are on here.

00:16.861 --> 00:18.195
Sorry, police only.

00:18.962 --> 00:21.046
It's okay. They're with me.

00:21.833 --> 00:23.033
Come on through, guys.

00:25.103 --> 00:26.802
What's this about, Chris?

00:27.505 --> 00:29.473
I need your eyes on something.

00:29.507 --> 00:32.543
We've got a homicide. It's the
third victim of a serial killer.

00:32.577 --> 00:34.211
Serial killer?

00:34.245 --> 00:36.437
He's dropping a body
every three months...

00:36.471 --> 00:38.482
two women, now a man.

00:38.516 --> 00:40.417
Are you sure it wasn't
two different perps?

00:40.451 --> 00:42.653
Well, most serial killers
target one gender.

00:43.588 --> 00:45.822
We did, like, 20 serial-killer
episodes on my show.

00:45.857 --> 00:47.858
Well, this guy likes to vary his diet.

00:47.892 --> 00:50.160
All three victims
were killed the same way

00:50.195 --> 00:52.696
and then dropped in the woods
within a mile of here.

00:52.730 --> 00:54.031
And then there's this.

00:54.899 --> 00:57.201
He draws it on the victim's eyelids.

00:57.235 --> 01:00.006
Looks weird. Looks like
some sort of math symbol.

01:00.041 --> 01:02.072
A math symbol, stick figure,

01:02.106 --> 01:04.541
some kind of weird iconography.

01:04.575 --> 01:06.877
The Behavioral Science Unit is
trying to figure out what it means.

01:06.911 --> 01:08.278
Any witnesses?

01:08.313 --> 01:09.680
A park ranger saw a white RV driving away

01:09.714 --> 01:12.128
about an hour before the body was
found, but we're not sure it's related.

01:12.162 --> 01:14.851
- Any other leads?
- Enough with the questions, Valetik.

01:14.886 --> 01:16.787
You're not a cop anymore.

01:16.821 --> 01:18.859
Eddie, you remember Detective Elder.

01:18.893 --> 01:19.907
Jay.

01:19.941 --> 01:21.058
And this is Sam Swift.

01:21.092 --> 01:22.726
Oh, right. The actor.

01:22.760 --> 01:25.062
And private investigator.
I'm a hyphenate.

01:25.096 --> 01:27.297
Well, don't go thinking we
called you in to crack the case.

01:27.332 --> 01:28.699
Then why did you call us?

01:28.733 --> 01:30.467
'Cause of this.

01:33.437 --> 01:35.705
Your business card was found
in the victim's pocket.

01:41.479 --> 01:42.941
Oh!

01:42.976 --> 01:44.514
Eddie, Sam.

01:45.483 --> 01:46.750
Lovely to see you.

01:46.784 --> 01:48.051
Mick. The body.

01:48.086 --> 01:49.119
Yeah, right, yes.

01:49.153 --> 01:51.121
Um, okay, so,

01:51.155 --> 01:53.520
as with all of the, uh, previous victims,

01:53.555 --> 01:55.792
this gentlemen was killed elsewhere

01:55.827 --> 01:57.628
and... and then deposited here.

01:57.662 --> 01:59.815
Uh, the cause of death is strangulation

01:59.850 --> 02:02.339
by way of a very thin wire.

02:02.373 --> 02:03.500
The killer used a garrote?

02:03.534 --> 02:04.859
That's so old-school.

02:04.893 --> 02:06.871
Yes, it's very old-school, yes.

02:06.905 --> 02:08.463
It was first used by the Romans

02:08.497 --> 02:10.107
in the first century B.C., actually.

02:10.140 --> 02:11.808
It's v...

02:11.843 --> 02:14.578
Whoever did this, uh, applied great force

02:14.612 --> 02:16.096
and... and... and produced

02:16.130 --> 02:19.950
some rather, um, gruesome injuries.

02:25.456 --> 02:26.990
That's Ken Hopkins.

02:27.025 --> 02:28.458
So you do know him.

02:28.493 --> 02:30.661
Yeah, he's a client... or was.

02:30.695 --> 02:32.829
He just hired us to find his wife.

02:32.864 --> 02:35.032
He's been missing for three months.

02:37.802 --> 02:39.703
The L.A.P.D. have gotten nowhere.

02:39.737 --> 02:41.872
I didn't know where else to turn.

02:41.906 --> 02:43.807
The police keep implying
that she left me,

02:43.841 --> 02:45.509
but Alison wouldn't do that.

02:45.543 --> 02:47.811
- She couldn't.
- Are you sure, Mr. Hopkins?

02:47.845 --> 02:49.680
Sometimes people keep secrets
from each other.

02:49.714 --> 02:50.981
You don't understand.

02:51.357 --> 02:53.058
Alison has a blood condition.

02:53.092 --> 02:54.226
She's on medication.

02:54.260 --> 02:56.814
I don't even know how long
she can survive without it.

02:56.848 --> 02:59.845
And then this turned up in a pawn shop.

02:59.846 --> 03:01.113
Is that Alison's laptop?

03:01.148 --> 03:02.615
She had it with her
when she went missing.

03:02.649 --> 03:04.350
Someone erased the drive,

03:04.384 --> 03:06.519
but I hired a data-recovery company.

03:06.553 --> 03:09.456
They salvaged a few files,
including a video.

03:09.490 --> 03:10.676
What kind of video?

03:10.711 --> 03:12.024
It's a video call...

03:12.058 --> 03:13.389
or part of one.

03:13.424 --> 03:15.193
Alison's talking to some guy.

03:15.227 --> 03:17.451
She's wearing earrings
I had just given her,

03:17.485 --> 03:19.620
so I know it's close
to when she disappeared.

03:19.654 --> 03:22.344
This man, I think he's
got something to do

03:22.369 --> 03:23.469
with what happened to her.

03:23.503 --> 03:24.621
Let's take a look.

03:25.706 --> 03:28.007
<i>You can see me, but I can't see you.</i>

03:28.041 --> 03:29.508
It's not fair.

03:29.543 --> 03:32.078
I prefer it that way.

03:32.112 --> 03:34.013
<i>There are things I want to to say to you,</i>

03:34.047 --> 03:35.615
<i>in-person.</i>

03:35.649 --> 03:37.149
<i>Then maybe we should meet.</i>

03:37.184 --> 03:39.161
She's agreeing to meet with someone.

03:39.686 --> 03:41.420
Did you find out who Alison's talking to?

03:41.455 --> 03:43.189
No, we just started investigating,

03:43.223 --> 03:44.390
running background on her.

03:44.425 --> 03:45.858
So the wife video-chats with this creep,

03:45.892 --> 03:47.660
goes missing. A few months
later, hubby gets iced.

03:47.694 --> 03:50.262
They're either
the world's unluckiest couple

03:50.297 --> 03:52.098
or the cases are connected.

03:52.132 --> 03:53.299
Your client's dead.

03:53.333 --> 03:55.601
Does that mean his case is dead, too?

03:57.337 --> 04:00.206
If Ken wanted us to find Alison,

04:00.240 --> 04:02.041
this gives us all the more reason to.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.396
In fact, our investigation
might intersect with yours,

04:04.430 --> 04:07.146
so I'm happy to share intel
if you do the same.

04:07.180 --> 04:09.148
We're not bringing you on board, Valetik.

04:09.182 --> 04:11.026
You're a civilian.

04:11.652 --> 04:12.852
Worse.

04:14.170 --> 04:15.888
Jay, he's looking for
the wife of our victim.

04:15.922 --> 04:16.970
It's another set of eyes.

04:17.005 --> 04:19.125
We're not outsourcing this investigation.

04:19.159 --> 04:20.526
How's that working for you, Jay?

04:20.560 --> 04:22.895
You got three dead bodies
and counting, no leads.

04:24.698 --> 04:27.166
What have we got to lose?
He's on a parallel track.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.734
It may not connect with our case,

04:28.769 --> 04:29.802
but what if it does?

04:34.568 --> 04:35.702
Okay.

04:35.737 --> 04:37.595
All right, we need
L.A.P.D.'s case file on Alison

04:37.630 --> 04:39.209
and a copy of the Murder Book.

04:39.243 --> 04:40.579
Keep Detective Rollins in the loop.

04:40.614 --> 04:42.048
Stay in your lane, Valetik.

04:45.025 --> 04:46.218
We'll be in touch.

04:48.188 --> 04:50.856
Detective Elder... not your biggest fan.

04:50.891 --> 04:52.658
Ah, he has his reasons.

04:54.094 --> 04:55.761
This is just so surreal, Eddie.

04:55.796 --> 04:58.330
I mean, we were just talking
to Ken Hopkins the other day.

04:58.365 --> 05:00.499
How many serial-killer cases
have you worked?

05:00.534 --> 05:01.660
Too many.

05:02.055 --> 05:03.856
But it's been a while.

05:04.104 --> 05:05.371
Look, we find Alison,

05:05.405 --> 05:07.540
maybe it'll lead us to the killer.

05:09.776 --> 05:11.505

Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

05:19.586 --> 05:20.977
Just got to say,

05:21.012 --> 05:22.811
it's pretty weird trying
to find a serial killer.

05:22.836 --> 05:24.290
Weird as in fascinating.

05:24.324 --> 05:26.425
I've read numerous articles
on psychopathy.

05:26.460 --> 05:28.494
Actually, what we're trying
to do is find Alison Hopkins.

05:28.528 --> 05:30.129
She's still a missing person.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.297
And what we're looking for

05:31.331 --> 05:33.365
is anything that connects her
to the other victims...

05:33.400 --> 05:36.068
Marsha Roberts and Cathy Avillard.

05:36.103 --> 05:37.803
I see something that connects them.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.206
- They all look alike.
- Yeah.

05:40.240 --> 05:41.417
The killer may have a type,

05:41.451 --> 05:43.209
which means we can't
rule out the possibility

05:43.243 --> 05:44.610
that he took Alison, too.

05:44.644 --> 05:46.220
But then why hasn't anyone
found her body yet?

05:46.245 --> 05:47.279
It's true.

05:47.314 --> 05:48.834
The killer left the bodies in the woods

05:48.868 --> 05:49.949
but not Alison's.

05:49.983 --> 05:51.383
Which means she might still be alive.

05:51.418 --> 05:52.785
Or it's an anomaly,

05:52.819 --> 05:54.220
like targeting two women then a man.

05:55.622 --> 05:56.922
All cases have anomalies.

05:56.957 --> 05:58.591
We can't always read into them.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.206
You guys keep digging.

06:01.240 --> 06:02.428
Where are you going?

06:02.462 --> 06:04.163
Pick up where we left off
on Alison's case...

06:04.197 --> 06:06.265
talk to her only family, her brother.

06:08.168 --> 06:10.236
What does the file say about him?

06:10.270 --> 06:11.873
Tim Stepansky.

06:11.907 --> 06:13.625
Looks like he's a tech investor,

06:13.626 --> 06:15.861
launched a bunch of
Silicon Beach start-ups.

06:19.632 --> 06:21.066
What are you thinking?

06:21.100 --> 06:23.101
I can't get Alison off my mind.

06:23.136 --> 06:24.970
I want her to still be alive.

06:25.004 --> 06:27.105
Do you think it's even possible?

06:28.474 --> 06:29.875
There's always a chance.

06:33.823 --> 06:36.081
Alison's been gone for three months.

06:36.115 --> 06:38.884
After all this time, I'd given up hope,

06:38.918 --> 06:40.452
and now a serial killer?

06:40.486 --> 06:43.055
With Ken dead,
- does that mean my sister...

06:43.089 --> 06:45.123
Well, there's no evidence of that.

06:45.158 --> 06:46.886
Right now, she's just missing.

06:46.920 --> 06:48.683
Then there's still hope.

06:49.696 --> 06:51.763
Alison... she had a rough childhood.

06:51.798 --> 06:53.071
We both did.

06:53.105 --> 06:55.968
Our mom ran off,
dad was a drunk, abusive.

06:56.002 --> 06:59.504
If she survived that,
she could survive this, too.

06:59.539 --> 07:01.106
Did Ken mention the video?

07:01.140 --> 07:02.320
He showed it to me.

07:02.354 --> 07:04.276
I don't know who Alison was talking to.

07:04.310 --> 07:05.508
I wish I did.

07:05.542 --> 07:07.579
Did she chat with people online?

07:07.614 --> 07:09.147
Was she social like that?

07:09.182 --> 07:10.816
Not that she ever said,

07:10.850 --> 07:13.576
but she's very trusting, Alison...

07:13.610 --> 07:15.153
- too trusting.
- In what way?

07:15.188 --> 07:17.589
She sees the best in everyone.

07:17.624 --> 07:20.125
It's why she teaches at a school
with high-risk kids,

07:20.159 --> 07:22.494
why she volunteers
serving meals on Skid Row.

07:22.528 --> 07:24.863
Did she ever have any problems
with anyone there?

07:24.897 --> 07:27.532
If she did, she kept them to herself.

07:27.567 --> 07:29.134
What about enemies?

07:32.005 --> 07:35.040
There was one man,

07:35.074 --> 07:36.375
but I already told the police.

07:36.409 --> 07:38.010
Why don't you tell us?

07:38.044 --> 07:40.846
Alison rented out a basement apartment

07:40.880 --> 07:42.214
to this grad student.

07:42.248 --> 07:43.925
A few weeks before she disappeared,

07:43.959 --> 07:45.050
she had to evict him.

07:45.084 --> 07:46.652
Drugs were involved.

07:46.686 --> 07:49.121
He threatened her. It got pretty ugly.

07:50.056 --> 07:52.190
Of course I was angry at Alison.

07:52.225 --> 07:53.959
But I didn't do anything to her.

07:53.993 --> 07:55.661
So why'd she give you the boot?

07:55.695 --> 07:57.162
She found drugs in my place.

07:57.196 --> 07:58.730
Well, that seems like a good reason.

07:58.765 --> 08:00.165
They weren't mine.

08:00.199 --> 08:02.768
She planted them there to break
the lease and kick me out.

08:02.802 --> 08:03.969
Why would she do that?

08:04.003 --> 08:05.837
I didn't understand.

08:05.872 --> 08:07.806
Then I ran into her contractor.

08:07.840 --> 08:09.641
He said Alison wanted me out

08:09.676 --> 08:11.543
so she could build a safe room
down there.

08:11.577 --> 08:13.211
I think she was afraid of something,

08:13.245 --> 08:14.746
but it wasn't me.

08:14.781 --> 08:16.214
Where were you last night?

08:16.249 --> 08:17.549
You mean do I have alibi?

08:17.583 --> 08:18.641
For what?

08:18.675 --> 08:20.218
Ken Hopkins' murder.

08:20.253 --> 08:22.054
Ken's dead?

08:22.088 --> 08:24.022
It wasn't me, all right?

08:24.057 --> 08:25.157
I've got nothing more to say.

08:27.000 --> 08:33.073

08:37.203 --> 08:40.038
His DNA, just case we need it.

08:42.741 --> 08:44.176
A text from Christine.

08:46.279 --> 08:47.713
They found another body.

08:51.725 --> 08:53.559
If the killer only kills
every three months,

08:53.593 --> 08:54.614
how is there a new body?

08:54.649 --> 08:56.542
- Do you think they found Alison?
- Hope not.

08:56.576 --> 08:57.920
What have we got?

08:57.954 --> 08:59.739
New victim, sadly.

08:59.774 --> 09:01.534
I'm just commencing the autopsy.

09:01.568 --> 09:03.153
Michael Pedraza.

09:03.187 --> 09:04.359
Do you recognize him?

09:04.393 --> 09:06.072
Has he shown up in your investigation?

09:06.106 --> 09:07.215
No, afraid not.

09:07.249 --> 09:09.208
Those are bruises on his knuckles.

09:09.242 --> 09:10.628
Signs of a struggle,

09:10.662 --> 09:12.688
- like he fought off his attacker.
- He did.

09:12.722 --> 09:15.414
Same cause of death,
same symbol, same woods,

09:15.449 --> 09:16.715
but this time,

09:16.749 --> 09:18.384
the victim was attacked while jogging.

09:18.418 --> 09:20.621
- The guy's escalating.
- Hello.

09:20.661 --> 09:23.263
What have we here?

09:23.297 --> 09:26.199
It's a hair, brown,

09:26.233 --> 09:28.940
unlike Mr. Pedraza's,
which is decidedly black.

09:28.974 --> 09:30.147
From the killer?

09:30.181 --> 09:31.771
Uh, quite possibly, yes.

09:31.805 --> 09:35.208
It perhaps transferred
during the struggle.

09:35.242 --> 09:37.510
Run tests on that hair, Mick. I
need everything you can tell me

09:37.545 --> 09:38.751
about who it came from.

09:38.785 --> 09:41.147
With all due haste.

09:41.181 --> 09:43.383
First Ken, now Michael Pedraza.

09:43.417 --> 09:44.717
Well, maybe there's some kind of tie

09:44.752 --> 09:46.686
between him, Alison,
and the other victims

09:46.720 --> 09:48.388
we're not seeing.

09:48.422 --> 09:49.989
Three murders, months apart.

09:50.024 --> 09:51.824
But now another one a day later?

09:51.859 --> 09:53.893
The relief he gets from the act
isn't lasting.

09:53.928 --> 09:56.180
Yeah, which means
he's gonna kill again soon.

09:56.215 --> 09:58.631
Did you get anywhere on Alison's video?

09:58.666 --> 10:00.133
The voice is too crushed to ID,

10:00.167 --> 10:01.668
but I'm working on cleaning up the image

10:01.702 --> 10:04.054
so that maybe I could figure out where
she was when she took that call.

10:04.615 --> 10:07.173
But I have been looking into
Michael Pedraza's social media.

10:07.207 --> 10:09.042
Look at this.

10:09.076 --> 10:11.644
Wait, is that Michael Pedraza
at L.A. Outreach?

10:11.679 --> 10:12.879
That's how he tagged it.

10:12.913 --> 10:14.981
Eddie, that's the homeless shelter

10:15.015 --> 10:16.883
where Alison volunteered.

10:16.917 --> 10:19.151
Yeah, and so did Ken Hopkins.

10:19.186 --> 10:21.554
He posted this just a week ago.

10:21.589 --> 10:22.922
There's Ken volunteering

10:22.957 --> 10:24.824
at the L.A. Outreach soup kitchen.

10:24.858 --> 10:26.426
L.A. Outreach.

10:26.460 --> 10:28.194
Maybe that's the connection
we've been looking for.

10:29.518 --> 10:31.564
Maybe the killer is another volunteer,

10:31.599 --> 10:33.366
someone who the victims knew,

10:33.400 --> 10:34.867
you know, who gained their trust.

10:34.902 --> 10:36.402
Or one of the homeless.

10:36.437 --> 10:37.670
Do you see what I see?

10:37.705 --> 10:38.838
Yeah, RVs.

10:38.872 --> 10:40.006
Christine said a white RV

10:40.040 --> 10:41.507
was seen leaving the area
where Ken's body was found.

10:44.778 --> 10:46.679
- Valetik.
<i>- Hey, Eddie?</i>

10:46.714 --> 10:48.348
<i>I have news on our possible killer.</i>

10:48.382 --> 10:49.601
The hair Mick found

10:49.636 --> 10:51.284
is from a white male, northern European,

10:51.318 --> 10:53.519
likely to be in his 30s or 40s.

10:53.554 --> 10:55.388
Well, that doesn't exactly
narrow it down.

10:55.422 --> 10:57.486
She's not got to the good part yet.

10:57.521 --> 10:58.791
So quick to denigrate.

10:58.826 --> 11:01.194
Analysis of the hair
shows he took anti-psychotics

11:01.228 --> 11:02.895
and then transitioned to street drugs.

11:02.930 --> 11:04.864
So he's mentally ill and off his meds.

11:04.898 --> 11:07.300
You know, Chris, the guy we're
looking for could be homeless

11:07.334 --> 11:08.468
<i>or living on the edge.</i>

11:08.502 --> 11:10.735
- Based on?
- It's just a theory for now,

11:10.770 --> 11:12.372
but if it turns solid,
I'll call you back.

11:13.741 --> 11:15.875
When Alison went missing,
we were devastated.

11:15.909 --> 11:18.620
And now Ken and Mike Pedraza...

11:19.780 --> 11:21.005
it's just a tragedy.

11:21.039 --> 11:23.983
Yeah, did, uh...
did Mike know Ken and Alison?

11:24.018 --> 11:25.151
Maybe casually.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.920
I'm sure he met them. They
probably had shifts together.

11:27.955 --> 11:29.722
Did they ever report having any problems

11:29.757 --> 11:31.290
with any, uh, of the men here?

11:31.325 --> 11:33.793
Maybe someone who was mentally ill?

11:33.827 --> 11:36.619
A lot of our clients
fit into that category,

11:36.654 --> 11:38.731
but nobody comes to mind.

11:38.766 --> 11:41.401
Alison, Ken, Mike... they're
all excellent volunteers.

11:41.435 --> 11:43.119
No conflicts at all with the folks here.

11:43.154 --> 11:45.004
Then maybe it wasn't about conflict.

11:45.039 --> 11:47.240
There any client who took
special interest in them?

11:47.274 --> 11:50.410
Uh, well, I do remember this one
guy used to leave Alison notes.

11:50.444 --> 11:51.744
And what kind of notes?

11:51.779 --> 11:53.980
- Poems that he would write.
- Like love poems?

11:54.014 --> 11:55.682
Nothing over the line.

11:55.716 --> 11:57.483
She would've told me.

11:57.518 --> 12:00.186
She, uh... she actually
said they were very good.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.954
This man, does he drive a white RV?

12:01.989 --> 12:03.256
Uh, yeah.

12:03.290 --> 12:04.924
As a matter of fact, he does.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.699
We need his name.

12:06.734 --> 12:08.059
Phillip H. Neal.

12:08.094 --> 12:09.429
N-E-A-L.

12:09.463 --> 12:11.998
Date of birth 10/13/1984.

12:12.032 --> 12:13.866
He was infatuated with Alison Hopkins,

12:13.901 --> 12:19.005
and he drives a white RV,
California plates HAL-1031.

12:19.039 --> 12:20.215
We'll run it down.

12:20.250 --> 12:22.208
All right, look, if he has a
record, would you send it my way?

12:22.242 --> 12:23.976
<i>We got this, Eddie.</i>

12:24.011 --> 12:26.279
I... I can't have you
chasing after a suspect.

12:26.313 --> 12:28.948
<i>I put myself out there to keep
you inside this investigation.</i>

12:28.982 --> 12:30.349
Yeah, because you know I get results,

12:30.384 --> 12:31.884
and we both want to catch this guy.

12:31.919 --> 12:33.119
I just need his background

12:33.153 --> 12:35.154
<i>to see how else he connects to Alison.</i>

12:35.189 --> 12:37.736
- Am I gonna regret this?
- Come on, Chris, it's me.

12:37.771 --> 12:38.858
<i>That's why I'm asking.</i>

12:38.892 --> 12:41.360
- I'm just gonna...
- Actually, don't tell me.

12:41.395 --> 12:42.995
The less I know, the better.

12:43.030 --> 12:45.064
<i>I'll send whatever files
we have to Berto.</i>

12:46.900 --> 12:48.656
We're gonna try to find
Phillip Neal, aren't we?

12:48.690 --> 12:51.037
Oh, yeah, starting with the woods
where the bodies were found.

12:51.071 --> 12:53.906
Finding him is our best shot
at finding Alison.

12:56.176 --> 12:58.311
Phillip Neal, numerous arrests...

12:58.345 --> 13:00.213
assaults, disorderly conduct.

13:00.247 --> 13:03.049
He was a computer-science major
at Cal State

13:03.083 --> 13:05.051
till he got diagnosed with schizophrenia.

13:05.085 --> 13:06.819
Well, that explains his use
of anti-psychotics, right?

13:06.854 --> 13:09.222
And why he started spiraling
when he stopped taking them.

13:09.256 --> 13:10.723
It's classic.

13:10.758 --> 13:11.882
Hey, check this out.

13:11.917 --> 13:14.378
He was institutionalized
and released a year ago,

13:14.412 --> 13:15.991
right before the killings started.

13:16.025 --> 13:17.864
At Sunshine Hills Clinic.

13:17.898 --> 13:19.446
I know that place.

13:19.481 --> 13:21.567
It's a super high-end
psychiatric facility.

13:21.602 --> 13:23.369
One of my professors works there.

13:23.403 --> 13:25.538
Uh, where are you going?

13:25.572 --> 13:27.006
Sunshine Hills.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.241
Without me?

13:33.113 --> 13:35.515
Dr. Santos,
thank you for meeting with me.

13:35.549 --> 13:36.849
Monica.

13:36.884 --> 13:38.251
This is unexpected.

13:38.285 --> 13:40.219
What brings you to my door?

13:40.254 --> 13:41.888
A patient, Dr. Santos...

13:41.922 --> 13:43.334
Phillip Neal.

13:44.028 --> 13:45.858
I'm not sure I understand.

13:46.451 --> 13:48.060
You know me as a psych student,

13:48.095 --> 13:49.436
but I do a bunch of other stuff,

13:49.470 --> 13:51.697
like work with a private investigator.

13:51.732 --> 13:52.965
We're trying to find him.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.967
I'd like to speak to whoever treated him.

13:55.002 --> 13:57.036
That's highly inappropriate.

13:57.528 --> 13:59.105
You took my ethics class,

13:59.139 --> 14:00.940
so you know full well

14:00.974 --> 14:02.809
patient information is confidential.

14:02.843 --> 14:06.112
Unless that patient poses a
threat to himself or others,

14:06.146 --> 14:07.814
which Phillip Neal does.

14:09.683 --> 14:11.784
We think Neal may have killed
at least four people,

14:11.819 --> 14:14.287
and we're trying to stop him
before he hurts someone else.

14:15.189 --> 14:16.509
Professor, please.

14:16.543 --> 14:20.159
If I can't speak to his doctor, is
there anyone here who knew him,

14:20.194 --> 14:21.894
who he might have confided in?

14:27.501 --> 14:29.836
Did you and Christine
work together in Homicide?

14:29.870 --> 14:32.071
Well, she was still in uniform
when I was there.

14:32.105 --> 14:34.407
She worked her way up the ladder
after I left.

14:34.441 --> 14:36.142
She's formidable.

14:36.176 --> 14:37.860
Yeah, I've noticed.

14:38.712 --> 14:41.514
I've also noticed that every
time we're at crime scene,

14:41.548 --> 14:42.648
you're in your element.

14:42.683 --> 14:44.851
- How so?
- You go on point.

14:44.885 --> 14:46.152
You take everything in.

14:46.186 --> 14:47.820
You ask all the right questions.

14:47.855 --> 14:49.322
I bet you were a great cop.

14:49.356 --> 14:51.190
Well, I had my moments.

14:52.860 --> 14:55.094
I see the way the other cops look at you,

14:55.128 --> 14:56.409
how Elder treats you.

14:56.444 --> 14:58.197
I know that feeling.

14:58.232 --> 14:59.966
It's not easy to live with...

15:00.000 --> 15:01.934
for me, at least.

15:01.969 --> 15:04.036
It's the consequences of being me

15:04.071 --> 15:06.539
and the decisions I made back then.

15:06.573 --> 15:09.308
I broke the Blue Code. It is what it is.

15:12.646 --> 15:14.480
Hey, Monica. Any news?

15:14.514 --> 15:15.982
Just breaking.

15:16.016 --> 15:18.117
I talked to a clinic patient
who knew Phillip Neal.

15:18.151 --> 15:20.152
- Well, how'd you manage that?
<i>- Doesn't matter,</i>

15:20.187 --> 15:21.721
<i>but I asked if she might have known</i>

15:21.755 --> 15:23.122
where he'd like to go or hang out.

15:23.156 --> 15:24.156
She did.

15:24.191 --> 15:25.157
Where?

15:25.192 --> 15:27.493
<i>The contact said Phillip
liked being in the woods.</i>

15:27.527 --> 15:29.128
It was his special place.

15:29.162 --> 15:30.357
Did she pinpoint where?

15:30.392 --> 15:31.998
Was it Griffith Park where
the bodies were found?

15:32.032 --> 15:33.032
No.

15:33.066 --> 15:35.067
The woods at Stone Canyon Park.

15:41.708 --> 15:43.175
Eddie, there.

15:49.216 --> 15:51.550
That's the same plate number.

15:52.435 --> 15:54.186
That's his RV.

15:54.221 --> 15:56.155
Stay behind me.

17:04.238 --> 17:05.828
So, this thing between you and Elder,

17:05.863 --> 17:07.729
is it professional or personal,

17:07.730 --> 17:09.597
because it looks personal.

17:09.632 --> 17:11.532
You know those dirty cops
I blew the whistle on?

17:11.567 --> 17:13.209
- One of them was his brother.
- Mm.

17:13.242 --> 17:14.935
Hey, Valetik!

17:14.970 --> 17:16.905
You went after him

17:16.939 --> 17:18.618
when I specifically asked you not to.

17:18.654 --> 17:19.854
I thought we had an understanding.

17:19.888 --> 17:21.442
I had a lead. I couldn't risk losing him.

17:21.477 --> 17:22.877
Was it Phillip Neal?

17:22.912 --> 17:23.877
Is he the killer?

17:24.960 --> 17:28.215
We found the murder weapon
along with trophies.

17:28.250 --> 17:31.186
He took personal items
from all the victims...

17:31.220 --> 17:32.506
jewelry mostly.

17:32.927 --> 17:35.223
There's the murder weapon,

17:35.257 --> 17:38.259
a necklace and rings
from the first two women,

17:38.294 --> 17:39.761
Ken Hopkins' money clip,

17:39.795 --> 17:41.963
Michael Pedraza's exercise watch.

17:41.997 --> 17:43.340
What about Alison?

17:43.374 --> 17:44.799
You find anything of hers?

17:44.834 --> 17:46.234
I'm afraid so.

17:49.391 --> 17:51.674
Those are the earrings
she was wearing in that video.

17:52.341 --> 17:53.741
I was hoping we'd find her.

17:53.776 --> 17:54.976
I know.

17:55.010 --> 17:57.412
But Phillip Neal won't hurt
anyone else because of you.

17:57.446 --> 17:58.600
That's a win.

18:02.518 --> 18:04.319
I'm sorry.

18:04.353 --> 18:06.821
Yeah. Me, too.

18:22.705 --> 18:25.006
I feel like we're missing something.

18:25.040 --> 18:26.474
I still don't understand

18:26.508 --> 18:28.910
why Phillip Neal went after Ken Hopkins.

18:28.944 --> 18:30.665
It fits no conventional profile.

18:30.700 --> 18:33.514
I mean, why kill Alison's husband
three months after killing Alison?

18:33.549 --> 18:36.818
Maybe he was coming unraveled,
decompensating.

18:36.852 --> 18:38.486
Or maybe it's like you said.

18:38.520 --> 18:40.321
Every case has anomalies.

18:44.793 --> 18:46.108
I got something to run past you.

18:47.830 --> 18:48.963
I cleaned up the picture

18:48.998 --> 18:50.946
and got a better view out
the window behind Alison.

18:51.901 --> 18:53.915
That's a high-rise building,
looks like downtown.

18:53.949 --> 18:56.037
It is downtown. That building
is at Flower and 7th,

18:56.071 --> 18:59.284
which means the video was taken from
the office building across the street.

18:59.318 --> 19:00.778
I can probably figure out exactly where,

19:00.812 --> 19:03.044
but since the case is done...

19:03.078 --> 19:04.345
Do you still want me to?

19:06.248 --> 19:08.483
- Chase it down.
- Got it.

19:10.519 --> 19:13.054
<i>We now know that, without question,</i>

19:13.088 --> 19:14.555
<i>Phillip Neal is the man</i>

19:14.590 --> 19:17.225
<i>responsible for these brutal murders.</i>

19:17.259 --> 19:19.060
I'd like to give special thanks

19:19.094 --> 19:21.796
to Detectives Elder and Rollins
<i>and their team</i>

19:21.830 --> 19:24.032
<i>for bringing this case to a close.</i>

19:24.066 --> 19:25.800
<i>We will continue to bring you more</i>

19:25.834 --> 19:27.168
<i>as this unfolds.</i>

19:27.202 --> 19:28.169
Hey.

19:28.203 --> 19:29.871
What are you doing back here?

19:29.905 --> 19:31.142
I couldn't sleep.

19:31.176 --> 19:33.908
My mind's still going 100 miles an hour.

19:33.943 --> 19:35.243
How do you shut it off?

19:36.200 --> 19:38.577
Well, if I knew that, I wouldn't be here.

19:39.114 --> 19:40.815
What's this?

19:40.849 --> 19:42.498
I thought we were done.

19:46.088 --> 19:48.356
You don't think
Phillip Neal's the killer.

19:48.390 --> 19:50.825
Something about it... it's too easy.

19:50.859 --> 19:52.427
But we tied him
to the last three victims.

19:52.461 --> 19:53.728
Yeah, but not the first two.

19:53.762 --> 19:55.592
And what about this?

19:55.626 --> 19:57.832
We still don't know what it means.

19:57.866 --> 19:59.100
But we were there.

19:59.134 --> 20:00.068
We found him.

20:00.102 --> 20:01.936
We saw the evidence.

20:03.018 --> 20:05.419
Are you sure this is about the case?

20:05.454 --> 20:07.786
- What do you mean?
- Being at a crime scene,

20:07.821 --> 20:09.911
working a high-profile investigation.

20:09.945 --> 20:12.647
Oh, what, you think I don't
want this to be over?

20:15.117 --> 20:17.485
What I want is to make sure
that we have the right guy.

20:18.654 --> 20:19.921
Okay.

20:20.327 --> 20:22.037
Then let's make sure.

20:22.458 --> 20:24.625
If you're right, Phillip Neal was framed.

20:24.660 --> 20:26.894
I want to check his autopsy
in the morning.

20:26.929 --> 20:29.230
I want to make sure
it really was suicide.

20:32.267 --> 20:33.701
According to the angle of view,

20:33.736 --> 20:35.269
Alison was here on the 27th floor

20:35.304 --> 20:36.371
when she made that call.

20:36.405 --> 20:38.492
A lawyer's office.
Why would she come here?

20:38.527 --> 20:41.109
I don't know, but this is the place.

20:41.143 --> 20:42.710
Same office building.

20:42.745 --> 20:44.379
Same bad art.

20:44.413 --> 20:46.114
I'm sorry. May I help you?

20:46.148 --> 20:47.548
Uh, yes.

20:47.583 --> 20:48.823
I'm Roberto Vasquez.

20:48.858 --> 20:50.251
We're with Valetik Investigations.

20:50.285 --> 20:52.320
Did you see this woman here?

20:52.354 --> 20:54.422
Yes, Alison Hopkins.

20:54.456 --> 20:56.457
I saw on the news she was
killed by that awful man.

20:56.492 --> 20:58.159
Do you know why she came here?

20:58.193 --> 20:59.594
To meet about a legal matter.

20:59.628 --> 21:01.024
What kind of legal matter?

21:01.058 --> 21:04.399
I can't reveal that, but our firm
specializes in criminal defense.

21:05.122 --> 21:07.500
Can you tell us what day that was?

21:08.937 --> 21:11.005
I guess there's no harm.

21:11.040 --> 21:12.473
Uh, let's see...

21:14.977 --> 21:16.305
May 3rd.

21:17.026 --> 21:18.646
May 3rd. That's the day she went missing.

21:18.680 --> 21:21.015
So, right after talking to
that guy, she disappeared.

21:21.680 --> 21:24.252
Do you recall Alison
video-chatting with someone?

21:24.286 --> 21:26.120
Yeah, on her computer.

21:26.155 --> 21:27.522
She stepped away to take the call.

21:27.556 --> 21:28.990
Did you hear the conversation?

21:29.024 --> 21:30.925
No, but afterward,

21:30.959 --> 21:33.027
she asked for directions
to the Willis Hotel.

21:33.062 --> 21:35.096
That must be where she met him.

21:35.130 --> 21:36.364
Thanks.

21:39.134 --> 21:40.935
Look, I'm sorry, Eddie,

21:40.969 --> 21:43.204
but everything here
points to suicide, right?

21:43.238 --> 21:44.705
The ligature marks on his neck

21:44.740 --> 21:47.508
are consistent with hanging
rather than strangulation,

21:47.543 --> 21:48.876
and his blood tests show

21:48.911 --> 21:50.611
near-fatal levels of fentanyl.

21:50.646 --> 21:53.032
So then it's possible that he
was drugged and then strung up.

21:53.586 --> 21:56.117
You and I both know
that victims of suicide

21:56.151 --> 21:57.819
are often highly intoxicated beforehand

21:57.853 --> 21:59.020
to work up the nerve,

21:59.054 --> 22:00.388
or in Phillip Neal's case,

22:00.422 --> 22:03.191
to make sure he actually
ended up dead this time.

22:03.225 --> 22:04.459
So this wasn't his first attempt?

22:04.493 --> 22:05.893
See for yourself.

22:05.928 --> 22:07.361
Both wrists.

22:07.396 --> 22:10.231
I sincerely doubt he cut himself shaving.

22:10.265 --> 22:11.593
Yeah, those are deep cuts.

22:11.627 --> 22:13.167
They would've severed the tendons, right?

22:13.566 --> 22:15.069
Undoubtedly, yeah.

22:15.104 --> 22:16.370
And you said that the victims

22:16.405 --> 22:17.705
were garroted with great force.

22:17.739 --> 22:19.173
So if the tendons were severed,

22:19.208 --> 22:21.242
how did he have
that kind of grip strength?

22:26.515 --> 22:27.648
Hey, Berto, what's up?

22:27.683 --> 22:29.750
<i>I'm at the office.
I got a lead off that video.</i>

22:29.785 --> 22:31.085
You need to come see.

22:32.524 --> 22:35.452
So, we figured out that Alison
took the video call at the law office

22:35.486 --> 22:36.657
the day she vanished.

22:36.692 --> 22:38.726
Where she was meeting a lawyer about
some kind of criminal matter.

22:38.760 --> 22:39.727
Right after the call,

22:39.761 --> 22:42.029
she went to the Willis Hotel
to meet someone.

22:42.064 --> 22:44.165
- The man from the video?
- That's what we're thinking.

22:44.199 --> 22:45.566
Well, does the Willis
have security cameras?

22:45.601 --> 22:47.902
They do. I know a girl who works I.T.
there,

22:47.936 --> 22:49.103
so it took some serious begging

22:49.138 --> 22:50.204
to get her to give me the footage.

22:50.239 --> 22:51.753
Which was very entertaining.

22:51.787 --> 22:54.175
So, watch this.

22:55.811 --> 22:57.745
This is the lobby of the Willis Hotel

22:57.779 --> 22:59.180
the day Alison disappeared.

23:01.250 --> 23:02.409
That's Alison.

23:04.720 --> 23:06.220
Eddie, you were right.

23:06.255 --> 23:08.122
That guy doesn't look like Phillip Neal.

23:08.157 --> 23:09.357
Who is he?

23:09.391 --> 23:11.125
Keep watching.

23:15.164 --> 23:17.465
That's Tim, Alison's brother.

23:24.490 --> 23:26.291
So, what am I looking at here?

23:26.325 --> 23:28.893
Alison Hopkins being led away
the day she vanished

23:28.928 --> 23:30.628
by her brother.

23:31.204 --> 23:32.290
So?

23:32.324 --> 23:34.365
So he never mentioned
seeing Alison that day,

23:34.400 --> 23:35.967
not to me, not to the L.A.P.D.

23:36.001 --> 23:37.702
So you think her brother killed her?

23:37.736 --> 23:39.270
We think he killed all of them.

23:39.305 --> 23:42.473
Based on your many years as a TV cop.

23:42.508 --> 23:44.309
What are you doing to me, Chris?

23:44.343 --> 23:45.908
Making you listen.

23:47.279 --> 23:48.746
Phillip Neal had a history of violence

23:48.781 --> 23:50.118
and mental illness.

23:50.152 --> 23:51.916
Why would Phillip Neal kill Alison

23:51.951 --> 23:54.190
and then kill her husband, Ken,
three months later?

23:54.224 --> 23:55.653
Who knows why, but he did.

23:55.688 --> 23:57.542
Now, we found the trophies
he took off his victims.

23:57.576 --> 23:58.887
They were put there for us to find.

23:58.922 --> 24:01.626
By master criminal Tim Stepansky,

24:01.660 --> 24:02.827
who's never had a speeding ticket?

24:02.861 --> 24:04.896
Stepansky is a donor and board member

24:04.930 --> 24:06.464
at the Sunshine Hills Clinic.

24:06.498 --> 24:08.266
That's how he knew about Phillip Neal,

24:08.300 --> 24:09.834
knew he'd be the perfect fall guy.

24:09.868 --> 24:12.136
Ken found the video of Alison.

24:12.171 --> 24:14.072
Tim knew that it could lead back to him,

24:14.106 --> 24:16.240
so he killed Ken to try to shut it down.

24:16.275 --> 24:17.575
And I think he killed Mike Pedraza

24:17.609 --> 24:19.177
so Ken's murder wouldn't stand out.

24:19.942 --> 24:21.982
You trying to embarrass
the department again?

24:22.017 --> 24:24.816
You know, get us to bite on
this weak-ass theory of yours

24:24.850 --> 24:26.484
so we all look like a bunch of idiots?

24:26.518 --> 24:27.713
Is that your angle?

24:27.747 --> 24:29.654
No, his angle is trying
to stop the real killer.

24:32.024 --> 24:34.396
Always the hero, Valetik.

24:41.245 --> 24:43.055
Come on, Chris.

24:43.089 --> 24:44.469
You know something's off.

24:44.503 --> 24:46.080
I have to tread lightly.

24:46.115 --> 24:47.538
The Chief already made the announcement.

24:47.573 --> 24:49.507
Then at least have Forensics
test the trophies,

24:49.541 --> 24:52.891
see if any trace evidence or DNA
points back to Tim.

24:53.579 --> 24:54.946
That I can do.

24:58.851 --> 25:01.452
I bet Tim was too careful
to leave evidence behind.

25:01.487 --> 25:03.488
Yeah, so do I, but it's a place to start.

25:04.723 --> 25:06.357
Alison's video.

25:06.392 --> 25:07.792
Maybe she somehow realized

25:07.826 --> 25:09.727
that Tim killed those two women.

25:09.762 --> 25:11.029
The call was her wanting to confront him.

25:11.063 --> 25:12.497
But she was afraid of what he might do,

25:12.531 --> 25:15.104
what might happen to him, so she
consulted a criminal lawyer.

25:15.139 --> 25:16.834
How could he kill his own sister?

25:16.869 --> 25:18.500
He's a sociopath.

25:19.338 --> 25:21.539
They're about as close
as you get to pure evil.

25:27.112 --> 25:29.234
There you are, Mr. Valetik.

25:29.269 --> 25:31.649
I apologize for just dropping in.

25:31.683 --> 25:33.851
Mr. Stepansky, what can I do for you?

25:33.886 --> 25:36.754
You've already done
all you could to find Alison.

25:36.789 --> 25:41.246
Now she's gone because of
that monster, Phillip Neal.

25:41.280 --> 25:44.640
Hey, Berto, can you get Mr.
Stepansky some water, please?

25:45.951 --> 25:47.481
Thank you. That's very kind.

25:47.506 --> 25:51.042
Of course. This must be
terribly upsetting for you.

25:51.964 --> 25:53.622
It was Ken who hired you, of course,

25:53.657 --> 25:55.500
but I wanted to pay you for your efforts.

25:55.534 --> 25:56.768
It's the least I can do.

25:56.802 --> 25:58.369
Oh, we can't take your money.

25:58.404 --> 25:59.837
But I insist.

25:59.872 --> 26:01.973
We haven't wrapped up the case yet.

26:02.007 --> 26:04.084
You think someone else is involved?

26:04.118 --> 26:05.839
We haven't ruled it out.

26:08.955 --> 26:11.723
And who would this someone be?

26:12.217 --> 26:14.485
We're still gathering evidence.

26:16.489 --> 26:18.268
Such commitment.

26:19.164 --> 26:21.499
That's what distinguishes you,
Mr. Valetik.

26:22.728 --> 26:24.335
I have been searching

26:24.369 --> 26:25.655
for someone with those qualities

26:25.689 --> 26:26.988
to head up my corporate security.

26:27.023 --> 26:28.800
I think I finally found him.

26:28.834 --> 26:31.090
There could be a position
for you as well, Ms. Swift.

26:31.091 --> 26:32.258
No thanks, I'm good.

26:32.293 --> 26:33.993
Salary in the six figures,

26:34.028 --> 26:36.262
pension, health, car allowance.

26:36.297 --> 26:39.165
Of course, you'd have to drop
all other investigations

26:39.200 --> 26:42.635
so you could truly focus on the job.

26:42.670 --> 26:44.003
What do you say?

26:44.038 --> 26:45.738
I say that's a lot to take in.

26:45.773 --> 26:47.640
Think about it, Mr. Valetik.

26:47.675 --> 26:49.007
I'll be in touch.

26:49.312 --> 26:50.910
Oh, here, I can take
care of that for you.

26:50.945 --> 26:52.078
That's okay.

26:53.781 --> 26:55.448
I'm still thirsty.

27:00.688 --> 27:02.396
Nice try.

27:03.123 --> 27:04.791
He's too smart for that.

27:04.825 --> 27:06.593
He came here to buy you off.

27:06.627 --> 27:08.495
And to see what we knew.

27:08.529 --> 27:11.071
We need to nail that son of a bitch.

27:11.999 --> 27:13.275
We put the board back up

27:13.309 --> 27:15.682
and built it around
Tim Stepansky as the killer.

27:15.717 --> 27:17.604
We got a hold of one
of Alison's photo albums

27:17.638 --> 27:18.771
and pulled more photos.

27:18.806 --> 27:20.747
We also dug deeper on Stepansky.

27:21.342 --> 27:24.010
Wait, is that another victim?

27:24.293 --> 27:26.045
That's actually Tim's mom.

27:26.080 --> 27:27.912
She abandoned the family when Tim was 12,

27:27.947 --> 27:30.116
leaving him and Alison
to be raised by their father,

27:30.150 --> 27:32.685
a drunk who knocked him around so much

27:32.720 --> 27:36.022
that Family Services eventually
placed him and Alison with relatives.

27:40.692 --> 27:43.296
He kills women that look like his mother

27:43.330 --> 27:45.231
because he hated her for abandoning him.

27:45.266 --> 27:47.400
An untrained but astute observation.

27:47.434 --> 27:49.869
How'd he find these women,
women that look like his mom?

27:49.904 --> 27:51.971
- I'll try and figure that out.
- And where'd he kill them,

27:52.006 --> 27:54.107
'cause he didn't kill them
in the back of that RV.

27:56.076 --> 27:58.878
Eddie, look at this.

28:03.617 --> 28:05.459
Look at the sidewalk.

28:06.220 --> 28:08.221
It's the same symbol.

28:08.255 --> 28:10.156
Yeah, look, and he's holding
a piece of chalk,

28:10.190 --> 28:12.158
which means he drew it.

28:13.961 --> 28:16.162
You said that Alison and Tim
went through Family Services.

28:16.196 --> 28:17.564
Who was their case worker?

28:19.967 --> 28:22.235
There they are, Tim and Alison.

28:22.269 --> 28:24.837
Sometimes I use these old tapes
for training.

28:24.872 --> 28:26.739
How well do you remember them?

28:26.774 --> 28:28.608
Some kids you never forget.

28:28.642 --> 28:29.876
Their dad beat them.

28:29.910 --> 28:31.293
They were so afraid of him,

28:31.328 --> 28:33.580
they made up their own language
using symbols.

28:33.987 --> 28:35.682
It's coming up right here.

28:35.716 --> 28:37.366
<i>What are you drawing there, Tim?</i>

28:38.205 --> 28:40.105
<i>Would you like to share it with me?</i>

28:47.728 --> 28:49.596
<i>Is that a person, Tim?</i>

28:50.440 --> 28:52.565
It looks like what we've been seeing,

28:52.600 --> 28:54.341
except it's a stick figure.

28:54.634 --> 28:55.901
<i>Who is it?</i>

28:56.843 --> 29:00.206
<i>It's Dad when he's mad.</i>

29:03.510 --> 29:05.519
Dad is the man he was afraid of.

29:06.347 --> 29:07.947
Now it's the man he's become.

29:13.476 --> 29:14.510
Watching that video,

29:14.544 --> 29:17.513
I think I know why no one
ever found Alison's body.

29:18.515 --> 29:20.883
It was Tim and Alison against their dad,

29:20.917 --> 29:22.418
against the world.

29:22.452 --> 29:25.254
Tim loved her. He couldn't kill his
sister and leave her in the woods.

29:25.288 --> 29:26.522
So what did he do with her?

29:27.924 --> 29:29.134
Valetik.

29:29.168 --> 29:31.827
<i>Hey, Eddie, it's Tim Stepansky.</i>

29:33.897 --> 29:35.331
How'd you get this number?

29:35.365 --> 29:38.434
<i>I was wondering
if you've considered my offer.</i>

29:38.468 --> 29:40.035
I have. I'm not interested.

29:40.070 --> 29:41.003
<i>Come on.</i>

29:41.037 --> 29:43.239
<i>Sam, make him see reason.</i>

29:43.273 --> 29:44.907
<i>This is a crossroads moment, Eddie,</i>

29:44.941 --> 29:47.343
<i>and I'm not someone
who takes "no" for an answer.</i>

29:47.377 --> 29:49.632
<i>So don't make a decision you'll regret.</i>

29:49.633 --> 29:51.210
<i>I'd hate to think this is the end.</i>

29:51.244 --> 29:52.778
Oh, you'll be seeing me again.

29:52.812 --> 29:54.766
Next time, I'll be coming to you.

29:54.800 --> 29:57.616
Where did he get your private number,
and how did he know I was here?

29:57.650 --> 29:59.618
- He's just trying to scare us.
- Well, it's working.

29:59.652 --> 30:01.553
- He's not after us, Sam.
- No?

30:01.588 --> 30:04.156
Look at me. Long, dark hair, petite...

30:04.190 --> 30:05.590
I'm totally his type.

30:05.624 --> 30:08.195
He could just be waiting
for me to be alone to strike.

30:08.230 --> 30:10.162
He could be lying in wait
inside of my house.

30:10.196 --> 30:11.463
We'll make sure he's not.

30:20.707 --> 30:23.442
That's a nice bat there, slugger.

30:23.476 --> 30:25.277
Well, a girl's got to protect herself.

30:25.311 --> 30:27.946
All right, look, all the doors and
the windows down here are locked.

30:27.981 --> 30:29.681
All the ones upstairs are, too.

30:29.716 --> 30:32.451
I just don't see sleep
in my immediate future.

30:32.485 --> 30:34.286
Eddie.

30:34.320 --> 30:36.655
- Look, did you see that?
- See what?

30:36.689 --> 30:38.023
In the backyard. I thought...

30:38.057 --> 30:39.658
You thought what? What did you see?

30:39.692 --> 30:41.660
A shadow. Human-sized.

30:45.632 --> 30:47.266
I'll cover you.

31:10.223 --> 31:12.958
Nothing.

31:12.992 --> 31:15.894
It was probably just
the shadow of a car going by.

31:17.864 --> 31:19.698
Yeah, probably.

31:21.901 --> 31:24.503
You gonna be okay?

31:24.537 --> 31:26.451
Y-Yeah, I'll... I'll be fine.

31:28.208 --> 31:29.741
Maybe I should stay.

31:38.952 --> 31:41.220
News flash... you're gonna blink first.

31:41.254 --> 31:43.088
I figured out how he found his victims.

31:43.122 --> 31:45.924
Mike Pedraza tracked his runs
with a sports watch.

31:45.959 --> 31:47.392
That's what killed him.

31:47.427 --> 31:50.062
I'm no expert, but I'm
pretty sure his sports watch

31:50.096 --> 31:51.363
didn't strangle him.

31:51.397 --> 31:53.895
Tim monitored the watch's GPS data.

31:54.400 --> 31:55.901
That's how he knew Mike
was jogging in those woods.

31:55.935 --> 31:57.612
Running stats are private.

31:57.646 --> 31:59.157
Are you saying Tim's a hacker?

31:59.192 --> 32:00.739
He doesn't need to be.

32:01.403 --> 32:02.975
One of his companies does data mining.

32:04.878 --> 32:07.779
With in-depth profiles
on millions of people,

32:07.814 --> 32:09.320
that's how he found his victims.

32:09.354 --> 32:11.079
I should've seen it.

32:11.584 --> 32:13.185
The signs pointed to Phillip Neal.

32:13.219 --> 32:14.786
Not all of them.

32:16.890 --> 32:18.496
I was too busy thinking
that I cracked the case

32:18.530 --> 32:20.025
when I got on to L.A. Outreach.

32:21.895 --> 32:24.596
I was just following the
breadcrumbs that Tim left for me.

32:26.633 --> 32:28.555
You weren't the only one.

32:32.906 --> 32:35.240
All that time you spent in Homicide,

32:36.104 --> 32:38.076
cases like this,

32:38.111 --> 32:41.113
how'd you keep the darkness
from getting to you?

32:41.147 --> 32:42.381
Well, sometimes you can't.

32:42.415 --> 32:44.082
It's why so many murder cops drink,

32:44.117 --> 32:45.951
get divorced.

32:45.985 --> 32:48.033
How did you protect yourself?

32:49.455 --> 32:51.657
By reminding myself
I was making a difference.

32:52.120 --> 32:54.459
What made you want to be a cop anyway?

32:55.582 --> 32:58.063
Um... my parents.

32:58.097 --> 32:59.898
- They were on the job?
- No, no.

32:59.933 --> 33:01.800
They were, um... they were immigrants.

33:01.834 --> 33:04.132
My dad had a store in Echo Park.

33:05.171 --> 33:07.839
And there were these guys
in the neighborhood

33:07.874 --> 33:09.608
that kept pushing him around.

33:09.642 --> 33:11.556
Yeah, and one night, they...

33:12.045 --> 33:13.679
they burned down his store.

33:13.713 --> 33:16.114
I was 7 years old.

33:16.149 --> 33:17.983
I remember watching the flames

33:18.017 --> 33:20.440
and the tears in his eyes.

33:22.388 --> 33:24.589
My dad was my hero.

33:27.794 --> 33:29.361
That's why I became a cop...

33:30.158 --> 33:31.496
to stand up for the people

33:31.531 --> 33:34.299
who can't stand up for themselves.

33:34.996 --> 33:36.702
And, you know,
when I saw those dirty cops

33:36.736 --> 33:39.438
do the same thing
that those guys did to my dad...

33:42.075 --> 33:45.544
You miss it, though, being a cop.

33:49.215 --> 33:50.762
Well, I miss...

33:51.584 --> 33:53.681
what being a cop should have been.

34:03.563 --> 34:05.797
It's Mick. He says it's urgent.

34:08.234 --> 34:10.969
Ah, good. You two are here.

34:11.004 --> 34:13.007
You'd asked for those
additional forensic tests.

34:13.041 --> 34:15.728
Well, the lab results from
the killer's trophies came in.

34:15.763 --> 34:17.862
Yeah, did they find any DNA
from Stepansky?

34:17.897 --> 34:20.411
No. No DNA or forensic evidence

34:20.446 --> 34:22.313
that implicates him in any way.

34:22.348 --> 34:24.216
They did, however,

34:24.250 --> 34:26.818
recover skin cells from the earring

34:26.853 --> 34:30.022
that is a match to Alison Hopkins.

34:30.056 --> 34:31.422
That doesn't sound like it helps us.

34:31.456 --> 34:33.891
Well, I didn't think so either, at first.

34:33.926 --> 34:36.328
But note the image on the left.

34:36.362 --> 34:38.386
Those are the cells found on her earring.

34:38.420 --> 34:39.898
And on the right,

34:39.931 --> 34:41.666
we have a slide with a random skin sample

34:41.701 --> 34:43.068
that's roughly three months old.

34:43.101 --> 34:44.438
Do you see the difference?

34:44.473 --> 34:46.838
The left looks pillowy, less dried up.

34:46.873 --> 34:49.608
Correct. That's because
Alison Hopkins' skin cells

34:49.641 --> 34:52.110
are no more than 48 hours old.

34:52.145 --> 34:53.745
That means that, when those earrings

34:53.780 --> 34:55.231
were removed from her ears,

34:55.266 --> 34:56.915
Alison was still alive.

34:59.059 --> 35:01.991
The skin cells prove that Alison's alive.

35:02.016 --> 35:03.706
Tim must be keeping her someplace, right?

35:03.740 --> 35:05.284
Just got to figure out where.

35:05.319 --> 35:08.121
He has a condo in Palm Springs
and a house in Malibu.

35:08.754 --> 35:11.190
Wait, if she's alive,

35:11.225 --> 35:13.659
that must mean that he's giving
her the medication she needs.

35:13.694 --> 35:15.183
Maybe we could track the prescription.

35:15.217 --> 35:17.040
I already have Berto and Monica on that.

35:17.074 --> 35:18.297
According to Zillow,

35:18.332 --> 35:20.512
the house in Malibu's
on 10 acres and it's gated.

35:20.546 --> 35:22.105
So it's secure, remote.

35:22.139 --> 35:24.037
- That's our best bet.
- Let's go check it out.

35:24.071 --> 35:25.271
I'll call Christine on the way,

35:25.305 --> 35:26.453
see if she can get a warrant.

35:26.454 --> 35:28.888
- Well, what if she can't?
- We'll go in anyway.

35:28.923 --> 35:30.090
Wait, we just got something.

35:30.124 --> 35:31.758
Alison's prescription ran out

35:31.792 --> 35:33.293
a few weeks after she vanished,

35:33.327 --> 35:35.762
turns out the drug
she's taking is super rare.

35:35.796 --> 35:38.398
So Berto hacked into
the distributor's database,

35:38.432 --> 35:40.467
and we found a new prescription
that started

35:40.501 --> 35:42.348
around the same time
that Alison's lapsed.

35:42.382 --> 35:43.528
Who wrote the prescription?

35:43.562 --> 35:45.472
Doctor at the clinic
where Tim is a donor.

35:45.506 --> 35:46.906
Sunshine Hills.

35:54.978 --> 35:56.471
Alison?

35:57.051 --> 35:58.818
Alison, we have to leave.

35:58.853 --> 36:00.587
Where?

36:00.621 --> 36:03.623
That island I told you about.

36:03.657 --> 36:06.326
It's warm, beautiful.

36:06.360 --> 36:07.982
You'll love it.

36:08.662 --> 36:10.864
I have your passport.

36:10.898 --> 36:12.699
I have your medicine.

36:12.733 --> 36:15.602
They found out what you did, didn't they?

36:15.636 --> 36:17.534
We just need a fresh start.

36:18.806 --> 36:21.439
I'll be better there.
We'll both be better.

36:21.473 --> 36:23.543
I won't go unless you tell me the truth.

36:23.577 --> 36:26.012
How many women did you kill?

36:28.849 --> 36:30.213
Alison.

36:31.218 --> 36:32.619
What can I say?

36:33.854 --> 36:35.321
I'm good with voices.

36:41.162 --> 36:43.463
Told you next time I'd come to you.

36:43.497 --> 36:47.200
Tim Stepansky, you're under arrest.

36:47.234 --> 36:48.701
For what?

36:48.736 --> 36:51.471
Let's start with kidnapping
and false imprisonment.

36:52.026 --> 36:53.907
Alison chose to be here.

36:53.941 --> 36:55.742
She knew she needed help.

36:56.447 --> 36:58.578
Just ask her, Mr. Valetik.

36:58.612 --> 36:59.993
She'll tell you.

37:00.581 --> 37:02.715
I'll be out by this afternoon.

37:07.254 --> 37:09.823
He can't just walk away
after all this, can he?

37:09.857 --> 37:12.525
Right now, we don't have proof
he killed anyone.

37:12.560 --> 37:14.994
With a defendant like him,
it's an uphill fight.

37:15.029 --> 37:17.263
Well, you can at least charge
him with kidnapping, right?

37:17.298 --> 37:19.332
That'll depend on Alison.

37:26.307 --> 37:27.440
Jay.

37:27.474 --> 37:30.567
Got to admit, you're the last
person I expected a call from.

37:30.601 --> 37:32.653
Alison Hopkins won't talk to us,

37:32.687 --> 37:34.914
not until she talks to you.

37:34.949 --> 37:37.717
But I need a word first... in private.

37:39.954 --> 37:42.994
Now, you and me,
we still got our differences.

37:44.959 --> 37:46.192
But you did okay on this.

37:46.227 --> 37:48.428
Is that some kind of compliment?

37:48.462 --> 37:50.096
As much as you'll get from me.

37:50.130 --> 37:51.403
Mm.

37:51.437 --> 37:53.867
So, I'm supposed to ask you,

37:53.901 --> 37:55.602
what is it you want, Valetik?

37:56.132 --> 37:57.356
I don't follow.

37:57.390 --> 38:01.074
Well, you didn't take credit,
didn't make us look bad.

38:01.108 --> 38:03.209
The way the Chief sees it,

38:03.244 --> 38:04.932
well, she owes you.

38:05.512 --> 38:06.946
That's a pretty big chit.

38:06.981 --> 38:09.201
So you think about what you want.

38:13.954 --> 38:15.507
I just wanted to thank you.

38:15.541 --> 38:17.323
I heard you were still looking for me

38:17.358 --> 38:19.125
when everyone else had given up.

38:19.159 --> 38:21.240
We're just glad that you're safe.

38:21.829 --> 38:24.764
It's important that you talk
to the police, Alison.

38:24.798 --> 38:26.142
Do you know how many times

38:26.176 --> 38:28.468
the police came to our house when
we were kids and did nothing?

38:29.179 --> 38:31.679
If they would've stepped in
sooner, Tim would've been okay.

38:32.119 --> 38:33.640
Was it the photos of the victims

38:33.674 --> 38:34.941
that tipped you off?

38:34.975 --> 38:37.173
I saw them on the news.

38:37.878 --> 38:40.613
They both looked so much like our mother.

38:40.648 --> 38:43.182
That's when I realized I
should've never left him alone.

38:43.217 --> 38:44.851
What do you mean by that?

38:44.885 --> 38:48.421
I always worried about him, his rage.

38:48.455 --> 38:50.423
I was the only one
who could pull him out of it,

38:50.457 --> 38:52.313
the only one who understood.

38:53.894 --> 38:55.733
Then I went off and got married.

38:56.697 --> 38:58.630
That's when he slipped away
into the darkness.

38:58.664 --> 39:00.366
This wasn't your fault, Alison.

39:01.406 --> 39:03.503
I should've just
turned him into the police.

39:03.991 --> 39:05.939
If I had, maybe Ken would be alive.

39:05.973 --> 39:07.640
Well, when you confronted him,

39:07.675 --> 39:08.975
did he admit what he'd done?

39:09.009 --> 39:10.832
He denied everything.

39:11.812 --> 39:14.881
Then he put me in that clinic,
and he kept me doped up.

39:14.915 --> 39:16.938
It doesn't matter what he
said to me, though, does it?

39:18.252 --> 39:20.186
You guys have evidence on him, right?

39:22.156 --> 39:24.290
Well, not enough.

39:25.259 --> 39:27.994
After what he did to those women, to Ken,

39:28.028 --> 39:29.062
he's gonna get away with it?

39:29.096 --> 39:30.229
Not if we can help it.

39:30.264 --> 39:31.898
You can't help it.

39:31.932 --> 39:34.424
Tim has money. He's gonna
hire the best lawyers.

39:34.459 --> 39:37.737
Alison, we think he took his victims
somewhere, someplace secret.

39:37.771 --> 39:39.472
Do you have any idea where that could be?

39:52.720 --> 39:54.854
You should've taken my offer.

39:56.127 --> 39:57.657
You know, that jailhouse blue

39:57.691 --> 40:00.256
really brings out your eyes, Tim.

40:02.196 --> 40:04.597
My bail hearing's in two hours,

40:04.631 --> 40:06.733
then I'm out of these for good.

40:07.424 --> 40:08.630
I wanted to tell you

40:08.665 --> 40:10.403
that I will personally
make sure my legal team

40:10.437 --> 40:13.072
turns you and your business to dust.

40:13.895 --> 40:15.875
Do you see the irony?

40:15.909 --> 40:19.112
You declined my offer,
but I'm still gonna own you.

40:21.248 --> 40:23.282
Alison told us about the house.

40:27.821 --> 40:31.057
You used a shell corp
to buy the old family home.

40:31.091 --> 40:33.860
Feeling sentimental?
All those happy memories?

40:37.164 --> 40:39.132
There's a crime-scene unit there now.

40:39.166 --> 40:42.006
They found blood and DNA
from at least three victims.

40:44.342 --> 40:46.205
You're not getting out of here,

40:46.719 --> 40:50.209
not in two hours, not ever.

40:55.082 --> 40:56.749
We'll see.

41:02.356 --> 41:03.990
Hey.

41:04.024 --> 41:05.279
Hey.

41:07.194 --> 41:09.429
So, looks like we got him.

41:10.284 --> 41:12.265
And Alison's alive.

41:15.269 --> 41:17.603
So, what did Detective Elder want?

41:18.334 --> 41:20.673
Well, he had a message from the Chief.

41:20.707 --> 41:22.308
He said the L.A.P.D. owed me

41:22.342 --> 41:24.340
and to think about what I might want.

41:25.012 --> 41:27.180
Do you think they were maybe
asking you back?

41:27.214 --> 41:28.981
I think the door's open.

41:29.016 --> 41:31.651
Is it something you're considering?

41:32.932 --> 41:34.538
You know, ever since I walked away,

41:34.572 --> 41:35.988
I wondered if I made the right choice.

41:38.626 --> 41:41.661
But I don't know. Going
back wouldn't feel right.

41:46.366 --> 41:47.767
You know, I've been thinking
about what you said

41:47.801 --> 41:50.803
about protecting yourself
from the darkness.

41:52.076 --> 41:55.007
Well, what helps most is having
a partner who has your back.

41:56.477 --> 41:59.030
And, um...

41:59.065 --> 42:00.313
And this.

42:04.649 --> 42:07.053
A St. Michael's medallion?

42:07.087 --> 42:10.123
The patron saint of cops and detectives.

42:10.157 --> 42:12.013
All my partners had one.

42:13.060 --> 42:14.527
You should, too.

42:16.163 --> 42:17.830
Thanks.

42:17.865 --> 42:18.998
Partner.
