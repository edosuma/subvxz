WEBVTT

00:08.486 --> 00:10.140
Hey! Hey!

00:10.140 --> 00:11.663
You have to tell them
it wasn't my fault.

00:11.663 --> 00:13.143
I was only naked
because my girlfriend

00:13.143 --> 00:15.363
locked me out of the house.

00:22.065 --> 00:23.414
I'm a lawyer.

00:23.414 --> 00:24.937
And a good one, I hope.
Otherwise, I'm screwed.

00:24.937 --> 00:27.723
Tyler Hamlin,
charges are disorderly conduct,

00:27.723 --> 00:29.942
exposure of a person,
grand larceny.

00:29.942 --> 00:31.161
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Judge,

00:31.161 --> 00:33.250
I did not steal that car,
all right?

00:33.250 --> 00:35.513
I had nowhere to sleep,
and the car was unlocked.

00:35.513 --> 00:37.602
Counselor,
control your client.

00:39.517 --> 00:43.086
Come on.
Say something.

00:43.086 --> 00:44.827
Um, uh, yes, Your--

00:44.827 --> 00:45.828
Whoa!

00:51.094 --> 00:52.878
Yes, Your Honor.
It was a big mistake.

00:52.878 --> 00:55.359
He was naked
and locked out of his apartment

00:55.359 --> 00:56.839
with nowhere to sleep.

00:56.839 --> 00:59.189
He'd never steal anything,
Your Honor.

00:59.189 --> 01:00.538
I object, Your Honor.

01:00.538 --> 01:02.540
The defendant has two priors
for burglary

01:02.540 --> 01:04.368
and failed to appear last time.

01:04.368 --> 01:06.544
I don't appreciate
being misled, Counselor.

01:06.544 --> 01:08.894
Bail is set at $50,000,
cash or bond.

01:12.855 --> 01:15.075
Miss Ramirez.

01:15.075 --> 01:16.206
Miss Ramirez?
- Huh?

01:16.206 --> 01:18.208
- Your suitcase.
- Ah.

01:18.208 --> 01:19.992
Saul Becker.
I've seen you around.

01:19.992 --> 01:21.603
Can I give you some advice?

01:21.603 --> 01:23.213
Cut your losses.
Go private.

01:23.213 --> 01:24.736
And get out while you can.

01:29.132 --> 01:31.700
Oh, no.

01:33.267 --> 01:35.225
One of those mornings, is it?

01:35.225 --> 01:37.793
Martínez.
He was on the Montana.

01:40.709 --> 01:41.797
We know.

01:41.797 --> 01:43.277
We are working
on a way to track him

01:43.277 --> 01:44.800
so that there are
no surprises next time,

01:44.800 --> 01:47.890
if he turns up.

01:47.890 --> 01:49.674
That is a lot of case files.

01:49.674 --> 01:51.589
You have 183 open cases.

01:51.589 --> 01:53.113
I assume I'm here
to win one of those.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.462
Let's find out.

01:54.462 --> 01:56.942
OK, you are Aleyda Ramirez.

01:56.942 --> 02:02.209
You are a public defender
in Queens, New York, 1985.

02:02.209 --> 02:04.080
And that is all we have so far.

02:04.080 --> 02:06.952
Well, I can at least link the
handlink to the court schedule

02:06.952 --> 02:08.432
so you'll at least know
where you're supposed to be.

02:08.432 --> 02:09.651
There you are.
Aleyda, please.

02:09.651 --> 02:11.131
I need your help
for one more thing.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.263
My bike, they won't release it
from the impound lot.

02:13.263 --> 02:14.743
Uh, Stuart Johnson.

02:14.743 --> 02:17.180
He was arrested
for unpaid parking tickets.

02:17.180 --> 02:19.269
Sure, Stuart.
Where's the impound lot?

02:19.269 --> 02:20.270
- Just around the corner.
- Mm.

02:20.270 --> 02:21.445
- Uh, Ben?
- Hmm?

02:21.445 --> 02:22.620
You need to get
to holding right now.

02:22.620 --> 02:24.056
You have a client
on trial for murder,

02:24.056 --> 02:25.580
and it starts in 20 minutes.

02:25.580 --> 02:27.147
And Ziggy says
that's why you're here.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.800
I have to be
in court right now,

02:28.800 --> 02:30.454
but I will help you
as soon as I'm out.

02:30.454 --> 02:31.673
You're a lifesaver.
Thank you.

02:31.673 --> 02:32.500
Mm-hmm.

02:32.500 --> 02:33.805
- Uh, Ben?
- Hmm?

02:33.805 --> 02:35.372
- Holding's that way.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

02:35.372 --> 02:36.852
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

02:40.247 --> 02:43.293
You got them down from 30
to 10 like you said you would.

02:43.293 --> 02:47.645
So I should
take this deal, right?

02:47.645 --> 02:50.996
Just let me look over it
one more time.

02:50.996 --> 02:53.129
OK, his name is Camilo Diaz.

02:53.129 --> 02:54.478
He's 18 years old

02:54.478 --> 02:57.481
and charged with the murder
of Nathan Herrera.

02:57.481 --> 02:59.091
Aleyda got the charges
knocked down

02:59.091 --> 03:00.528
from murder two
to manslaughter,

03:00.528 --> 03:02.747
but Ziggy says you're here
to prove his innocence.

03:02.747 --> 03:05.576
Well, 10 is way better
than 30, that's for sure.

03:05.576 --> 03:06.621
But--

03:06.621 --> 03:09.580
But ten's still a long time.

03:09.580 --> 03:12.017
And I need
to be there for Leo.

03:12.017 --> 03:13.323
His little brother.

03:13.323 --> 03:15.673
Camilo is
the sole caretaker of him

03:15.673 --> 03:17.893
and
their 65-year-old grandmother.

03:19.329 --> 03:22.245
Camilo, what happened
between you and Nathan Herrera?

03:22.245 --> 03:24.029
You know all that already,
all right?

03:24.029 --> 03:26.336
He was pushing my brother
to join Viento Este.

03:26.336 --> 03:28.338
- Viento Este?
- The local gang

03:28.338 --> 03:29.600
where we live in Queens.
- Right.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.341
He wanted Leo
to work the corner,

03:31.341 --> 03:33.343
but I won't let him
go down that path.

03:33.343 --> 03:34.692
In the original timeline,

03:34.692 --> 03:37.347
Camilo took the deal,
went to jail,

03:37.347 --> 03:39.262
and his brother
still joined the gang.

03:39.262 --> 03:41.395
He was shot dead
before he got out.

03:44.528 --> 03:48.053
Camilo, I don't think
we should take this deal.

03:48.053 --> 03:49.533
What?

03:49.533 --> 03:51.927
You said
this is the best I could do.

03:51.927 --> 03:53.668
I mean,
there's no other suspects,

03:53.668 --> 03:55.235
no evidence that helps me.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.193
I was in the building
when it happened.

03:57.193 --> 03:58.716
And then I ran like an idiot,

03:58.716 --> 04:00.283
so now,
I have to take this deal.

04:00.283 --> 04:02.459
Did you shoot Nathan Herrera?

04:02.459 --> 04:05.157
No, but you said
that wouldn't matter.

04:05.157 --> 04:08.117
Yeah, it matters to me.

04:08.117 --> 04:11.076
You shouldn't have to spend
one more day in prison

04:11.076 --> 04:12.295
for something you didn't do.

04:12.295 --> 04:14.297
You deserve your day in court.

04:14.297 --> 04:17.909
So I say we fight.

04:17.909 --> 04:18.954
We go to trial.

04:30.444 --> 04:31.793
OK, finally.

04:31.793 --> 04:34.752
So I isolated the anomalies
in the quantum code

04:34.752 --> 04:36.580
from both times
that we encountered Leaper X.

04:36.580 --> 04:38.060
And I--
- Oh, you said "Leaper X."

04:38.060 --> 04:41.368
From both times
that we encountered Martínez.

04:41.368 --> 04:43.413
And I ran those
against the anomalies

04:43.413 --> 04:44.588
that Ben creates
whenever he leaps.

04:44.588 --> 04:45.937
Ian, please stop.

04:45.937 --> 04:47.896
I already feel a headache
coming on.

04:47.896 --> 04:49.767
Look, I just need to know,
will this thing--

04:49.767 --> 04:51.247
Program.

04:51.247 --> 04:52.509
Program alert us

04:52.509 --> 04:54.381
the next time Leaper X
and Ben cross paths?

04:54.381 --> 04:56.383
Well, it will now.

04:56.383 --> 04:57.427
No, I didn't?

04:57.427 --> 04:59.473
Did I?
I said "Leaper X."

04:59.473 --> 05:01.213
My wallet's upstairs.

05:01.213 --> 05:02.780
Now you said it twice.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.263
Did Magic lose
another dollar?

05:07.263 --> 05:08.438
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

05:08.438 --> 05:09.831
Ah, you wanted to see me.

05:09.831 --> 05:11.789
I just got off the phone
with the DA from Queens.

05:11.789 --> 05:14.226
He's gonna dig up
Camilo Diaz's case file for us.

05:14.226 --> 05:18.579
Great, but I was thinking
of another way to help Ben.

05:18.579 --> 05:20.972
OK, so the last leap was
so easy for me to navigate

05:20.972 --> 05:23.018
because
of my military experience.

05:23.018 --> 05:27.196
But, I mean, the legal system?
Not so much.

05:27.196 --> 05:30.417
However,
we do have someone here

05:30.417 --> 05:34.769
who knows their way around it
quite well.

05:34.769 --> 05:37.162
You want me
to go in the chamber?

05:37.162 --> 05:38.947
Ben needs you.

05:38.947 --> 05:40.688
Yeah,
that's not my job description.

05:40.688 --> 05:42.646
Besides, I'm terrible
at all that emotional support

05:42.646 --> 05:43.821
and
positive reinforcement stuff.

05:43.821 --> 05:46.433
Jenn, you are
the only person here

05:46.433 --> 05:47.956
that has experience
in a courtroom.

05:47.956 --> 05:50.088
When I was on trial,
not as a lawyer.

05:50.088 --> 05:52.656
- But you do have a law degree.
- You do?

05:52.656 --> 05:53.918
Can you imagine Jenn

05:53.918 --> 05:55.746
sitting in a prison cell
doing nothing?

05:55.746 --> 05:57.574
Look, I know I think
I can do everything,

05:57.574 --> 05:59.837
but I can't do this.

05:59.837 --> 06:03.101
Well, I guess we're lucky
this is a military operation

06:03.101 --> 06:04.929
and I give the orders.

06:07.062 --> 06:08.890
I'm going in right now.

06:10.152 --> 06:11.893
Oh, good morning.

06:16.463 --> 06:18.639
Wow.
It's great to see you, Ben.

06:20.554 --> 06:21.598
Are you another leaper?

06:21.598 --> 06:23.644
No, that would be very bad.

06:23.644 --> 06:26.560
But we probably should have
thought this through.

06:26.560 --> 06:28.997
You're a hologram.

06:28.997 --> 06:29.998
Where's Addison?

06:29.998 --> 06:31.869
Hey. I'm here.

06:31.869 --> 06:34.263
We were just hoping
if you saw Jenn by herself,

06:34.263 --> 06:36.308
you might remember her.

06:36.308 --> 06:37.484
- Nothing, huh?
- Yeah.

06:37.484 --> 06:39.790
Sorry, Jenn,
but it is nice to meet you.

06:39.790 --> 06:42.053
Ugh.

06:42.053 --> 06:44.795
OK, we can't keep two people
in the chamber very long.

06:44.795 --> 06:46.362
Right.
Now, I'm jumping in

06:46.362 --> 06:47.450
because I know
the justice system.

06:47.450 --> 06:48.756
- Oh, you're a lawyer.
- No.

06:48.756 --> 06:50.410
I'm a hacker who was caught
and put on trial.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.977
Which means that Jenn
has spent time in a courtroom.

06:52.977 --> 06:55.066
Also, she has a law degree.
- I do.

06:55.066 --> 06:57.765
I know me, and me was likely
to get in trouble again, so...

06:57.765 --> 07:00.420
- Let's stay on point.
- Yes. Right.

07:00.420 --> 07:01.812
So I'm here to talk you through

07:01.812 --> 07:03.292
what you're gonna say
to the judge.

07:03.292 --> 07:05.076
Probably feels like the deck
is stacked against you,

07:05.076 --> 07:06.251
because it is.

07:06.251 --> 07:08.166
OK. Come on.

07:08.166 --> 07:09.254
But it's gonna be great.

07:10.342 --> 07:12.083
OK.

07:12.083 --> 07:14.259
Well, that is my cue.

07:14.259 --> 07:15.696
You're in good hands with Jenn.

07:15.696 --> 07:17.132
See you soon, I hope.

07:17.132 --> 07:18.655
Of course.

07:18.655 --> 07:19.830
I love you.

07:21.484 --> 07:22.877
I love you too.

07:28.012 --> 07:29.187
Sorry.

07:33.322 --> 07:36.325
OK, we have five minutes
before you're due in court.

07:36.325 --> 07:37.500
Now, the judge is gonna ask

07:37.500 --> 07:38.936
for your client's decision
on the deal.

07:38.936 --> 07:42.200
That's when you'll say
his plea remains not guilty.

07:42.200 --> 07:43.680
Now, the problem here
is that your trial

07:43.680 --> 07:45.334
is due to start today,
so then you say...

07:45.334 --> 07:48.119
Your Honor, we are
requesting an adjournment.

07:48.119 --> 07:49.512
An adjournment?

07:49.512 --> 07:51.340
Absolutely not.
I object, Your Honor.

07:51.340 --> 07:53.473
It's not our fault their client
can't make up their mind.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.126
What are you playing at,
Counselor?

07:55.126 --> 07:57.520
You just spent four weeks
negotiating this deal.

07:57.520 --> 07:59.087
Now you just want
to throw it all away?

07:59.087 --> 08:00.610
Say you have a motion
to preclude evidence.

08:00.610 --> 08:03.308
I have a motion
to preclude evidence.

08:03.308 --> 08:05.093
Then where is it?

08:05.093 --> 08:07.008
I don't know yet.

08:07.008 --> 08:08.966
New evidence that you've
just been made aware of.

08:08.966 --> 08:10.968
It's new evidence
I've just become aware of.

08:10.968 --> 08:12.579
The court
will not adjourn this case

08:12.579 --> 08:15.712
because you failed
to file proper motions.

08:15.712 --> 08:18.715
Look, Counselor, you want
your name on my dance card,

08:18.715 --> 08:21.196
you get out on the dance floor,
show me your moves.

08:21.196 --> 08:24.068
Trial begins at 2:00.

08:25.156 --> 08:26.984
Like I said,
stacked against you.

08:26.984 --> 08:28.464
You're sure
this was the right decision?

08:28.464 --> 08:30.031
Don't worry, Camilo.
We got this.

08:30.031 --> 08:32.337
Aleyda,
get my brother out of here.

08:32.337 --> 08:35.863
<i>Leo, no entiendo.
¿Que dijo, mijo?</i>

08:35.863 --> 08:37.560
Yeah, my grandma wants
to know what's going on.

08:37.560 --> 08:38.648
We thought
he was taking a deal.

08:38.648 --> 08:40.781
Hi, Leo.

08:40.781 --> 08:42.739
We decided
we're gonna fight this.

08:42.739 --> 08:44.219
<i>No es tomar el trato.</i>

08:44.219 --> 08:45.699
Oh, no.

08:46.917 --> 08:48.528
You better know
what you're doing.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.225
Come on, Abuela.

08:51.879 --> 08:53.489
The discovery
for your perusal.

08:53.489 --> 08:54.664
Enjoy your reading.

08:54.664 --> 08:57.145
Hope you didn't have
any plans tonight.

08:57.145 --> 09:00.017
You really want to waste
my time with this? Fine.

09:00.017 --> 09:03.064
I'm gonna
put your client away for life.

09:06.807 --> 09:09.026
I see
you didn't take that deal.

09:09.026 --> 09:11.159
You are a glutton
for punishment, kid.

09:11.159 --> 09:13.683
Maybe you do belong here
after all.

09:13.683 --> 09:16.860
They only handed me
this discovery just now.

09:16.860 --> 09:18.296
Is that even legal?

09:18.296 --> 09:20.298
They only have to hand it
to you before the trial.

09:20.298 --> 09:22.344
There's no rule
on how long before.

09:22.344 --> 09:24.389
Why do you think
we call it a Blindfold Law?

09:24.389 --> 09:25.695
How is that a fair trial?

09:25.695 --> 09:28.176
You think ADA Barnes
is playing fair?

09:28.176 --> 09:30.439
He wants to be DA.
He's playing to win.

09:30.439 --> 09:33.877
OK, so how am I supposed
to get through all this?

09:33.877 --> 09:35.400
You don't.
You're supposed to fight

09:35.400 --> 09:37.359
for the best deal you can get
and then move on,

09:37.359 --> 09:40.362
because one person simply
can't read all those files,

09:40.362 --> 09:44.105
construct a decent defense, and
cover the rest of their cases.

09:47.848 --> 09:49.327
What just happened?

09:49.327 --> 09:51.808
Did I make the wrong decision?
Because he's right.

09:51.808 --> 09:53.984
It's impossible for one person
to read all this.

09:53.984 --> 09:56.639
One person, sure,
but as we speak,

09:56.639 --> 09:58.119
Magic--
he's the head of Quantum Leap--

09:58.119 --> 10:00.295
is getting the Queens DA
to dig up the original files.

10:00.295 --> 10:01.818
And I wager

10:01.818 --> 10:03.603
that one A.I. called Ziggy
can get through them faster

10:03.603 --> 10:05.256
than the world's
best legal team can.

10:05.256 --> 10:09.739
OK, so Ziggy can search for
clues while I get up to speed.

10:09.739 --> 10:11.349
Let's find someplace to work.

10:11.349 --> 10:13.395
Is it like this
for all public defenders?

10:13.395 --> 10:15.179
Fun fact:
the average public defender

10:15.179 --> 10:17.268
gets seven minutes
with their client.

10:17.268 --> 10:18.966
I see now
why you got a law degree.

10:18.966 --> 10:20.924
Ben, you got pre-trial
for an armed robbery

10:20.924 --> 10:23.013
in courtroom five right now.

10:23.013 --> 10:24.232
That way.

10:28.932 --> 10:31.239
We get everything we needed
from the Queens DA?

10:31.239 --> 10:33.284
Well,
I'm going through it all now.

10:33.284 --> 10:36.897
It seems that Camilo was in the
wrong place at the wrong time.

10:36.897 --> 10:38.855
And, unfortunately,
witnesses saw him

10:38.855 --> 10:40.944
threatening the victim
earlier in the week,

10:40.944 --> 10:45.079
telling him to stay away
from his brother, Leo, or else.

10:45.079 --> 10:47.298
And how is she really doing?

10:47.298 --> 10:49.039
It's hard to say.

10:49.039 --> 10:51.259
I mean, she hasn't looked up
from that screen once.

10:51.259 --> 10:54.479
She's been in that
imaging chamber 24/7 for weeks,

10:54.479 --> 10:57.657
so keep an eye on her.

11:03.053 --> 11:05.142
Now, we got 30 minutes
till Camilo's trial starts.

11:05.142 --> 11:07.492
And biker guy is right there.

11:07.492 --> 11:11.018
OK, this way.

11:11.018 --> 11:12.367
OK.

11:12.367 --> 11:14.108
Here's good.

11:14.108 --> 11:15.326
Let's work here.

11:15.326 --> 11:16.719
And coffee.

11:19.330 --> 11:22.029
Ben, uh, scary ADA chick
is coming this way.

11:22.029 --> 11:23.595
Oh.

11:23.595 --> 11:25.293
You don't want to clue me in
on what you were thinking?

11:25.293 --> 11:26.555
Was I supposed to?

11:26.555 --> 11:28.383
Of course not,
but it would have been nice

11:28.383 --> 11:29.732
to know I'd be pulling
an all-nighter

11:29.732 --> 11:30.994
to get up to speed
on this trial

11:30.994 --> 11:32.604
instead of doing
what I prefer to be doing.

11:32.604 --> 11:33.910
Hmm. Which is?

11:36.870 --> 11:38.828
I totally
should have seen that coming.

11:45.617 --> 11:46.575
Now, did you cancel
our dinner reservation,

11:46.575 --> 11:47.576
or should I do that?

11:47.576 --> 11:49.578
Ooh, sleeping with the enemy.

11:49.578 --> 11:53.321
I did not
cancel our reservation.

11:53.321 --> 11:54.844
I'll reset
for Saturday, then.

11:54.844 --> 11:57.586
Mm, you should have
seen Barnes' face.

11:57.586 --> 11:58.979
I thought
he was having a stroke.

11:58.979 --> 12:01.590
And I know you can't tell me,

12:01.590 --> 12:03.026
but you must
have something huge

12:03.026 --> 12:05.072
to be blowing the deal
at the 11th hour like this.

12:05.072 --> 12:06.464
Yeah.

12:06.464 --> 12:07.901
And you're paying
for dinner Saturday.

12:07.901 --> 12:10.294
Fair punishment for ruining
our anniversary tonight.

12:10.294 --> 12:13.558
Don't you agree, Counselor?

12:13.558 --> 12:15.256
Aleyda, you OK?

12:15.256 --> 12:16.910
Sorry. Yeah, I--

12:16.910 --> 12:21.349
Is this ethical, for us to be
on the same case like this?

12:21.349 --> 12:22.785
Well if you want
to hand off the case,

12:22.785 --> 12:24.308
then please do,
by all means.

12:24.308 --> 12:26.006
No,
but I'm all that Camilo has.

12:26.006 --> 12:28.008
And since you're a second
chair, I thought that maybe--

12:28.008 --> 12:30.793
You thought that I should
just explain to ADA Barnes

12:30.793 --> 12:32.012
that I've been...

12:32.012 --> 12:34.841
secretly sleeping
with a public defender

12:34.841 --> 12:37.104
for the entire three years
I've been at the DA's office,

12:37.104 --> 12:38.583
jeopardizing hundreds of cases?

12:38.583 --> 12:39.846
You'll get fired.

12:39.846 --> 12:43.327
I'm just one year away
from making first chair.

12:45.460 --> 12:48.855
Look, I'll get Chinese
for us tonight.

12:48.855 --> 12:51.248
It can be like
we're back in college,

12:51.248 --> 12:54.469
staying up late,
studying for finals,

12:54.469 --> 12:58.038
you looking over my shoulder
for the answers.

13:00.301 --> 13:03.304
Yeah.
OK, I'd like that.

13:03.304 --> 13:06.611
I'm so excited for you.

13:06.611 --> 13:08.439
Good luck in there.

13:11.051 --> 13:13.531
- She thinks I have something.
- She does.

13:13.531 --> 13:16.360
We better get on that.

13:16.360 --> 13:17.709
Does anyone else enter

13:17.709 --> 13:19.363
or exit the building
during this time?

13:19.363 --> 13:21.670
No, he's the only one
to enter or exit

13:21.670 --> 13:23.063
for the next 52 minutes.

13:23.063 --> 13:24.499
Your witness, Counselor.

13:28.895 --> 13:31.723
There are other ways
to enter the building, correct?

13:31.723 --> 13:33.508
There's a door off
the trash room onto the alley.

13:33.508 --> 13:35.031
But you need a key.
- Mm.

13:35.031 --> 13:37.207
And with 240 tenants,

13:37.207 --> 13:39.122
don't you think
someone could have stolen--

13:39.122 --> 13:41.124
Objection. Speculation.

13:41.124 --> 13:42.082
Sustained.

13:46.826 --> 13:49.350
Your tenant at 405, didn't
they say someone stole her--

13:49.350 --> 13:51.134
Objection. Hearsay.

13:51.134 --> 13:53.397
Sustained.

13:55.312 --> 13:56.879
I was on duty
in my patrol car

13:56.879 --> 13:58.663
when I heard
the two shots fired.

13:58.663 --> 14:00.709
As I called it in,

14:00.709 --> 14:03.886
the defendant ran
right past my car.

14:03.886 --> 14:05.888
That's when I got out
and tackled him to the ground.

14:05.888 --> 14:07.411
And did the defendant
say anything

14:07.411 --> 14:08.804
when you tackled him
to the ground?

14:08.804 --> 14:10.110
Yes.

14:10.110 --> 14:13.026
He said, "I didn't do it.
It wasn't me."

14:13.026 --> 14:14.505
What do you think the
defendant was talking about?

14:14.505 --> 14:15.942
- That's speculation.
- Objection.

14:15.942 --> 14:19.249
Speculation, Your Honor.

14:19.249 --> 14:21.773
I'll rephrase.

14:21.773 --> 14:23.993
Did the defendant do anything

14:23.993 --> 14:27.040
as he said
that he didn't do it?

14:27.040 --> 14:28.693
Yes.

14:28.693 --> 14:31.131
He looked back at the building
where the gunshots came from.

14:32.523 --> 14:35.744
We'll pick up tomorrow
at 11:00 with the defense.

14:38.616 --> 14:40.444
It's our turn tomorrow.

14:40.444 --> 14:42.185
It'll feel different then,
I promise.

14:42.185 --> 14:43.708
Yeah, you can't promise
what you don't know.

14:43.708 --> 14:46.450
- Leo.
- What?

14:46.450 --> 14:49.192
Come on, Abuela.

14:49.192 --> 14:52.326
<i>Ella no sabe nada.</i>

14:52.326 --> 14:53.936
You speak Spanish.
What did he say?

14:53.936 --> 14:55.938
He said
I don't know anything.

14:55.938 --> 14:57.548
And he's right.

14:59.637 --> 15:01.552
Nothing.

15:01.552 --> 15:03.946
I've got nothing.
Has Ziggy found anything?

15:03.946 --> 15:05.426
Ziggy's going through
background information

15:05.426 --> 15:08.298
on the Viento Este gang,
but it's a lot to get through.

15:08.298 --> 15:09.778
What did I miss?

15:09.778 --> 15:11.214
Instead of research
or running predictions,

15:11.214 --> 15:13.477
let's have Ziggy focus
just on the discovery files

15:13.477 --> 15:14.783
to see
if anything's been left out--

15:14.783 --> 15:16.524
a missing witness statement,
forensics report.

15:16.524 --> 15:18.613
- How about a missing page?
- Yeah, anything that can--

15:18.613 --> 15:20.310
No, Ben,
Ziggy found a missing page.

15:20.310 --> 15:22.965
Open the police report.

15:22.965 --> 15:24.401
The list of people
detectives interviewed

15:24.401 --> 15:26.664
the night of the murder,
it was two pages.

15:28.188 --> 15:32.322
Yeah, it says
page one of two right here.

15:32.322 --> 15:34.629
There's a page missing.

15:34.629 --> 15:36.500
Ow, ow, ow.

15:37.501 --> 15:38.633
Saul?
- Yeah?

15:38.633 --> 15:39.895
- Saul, hi.
- I'll see you inside.

15:39.895 --> 15:41.810
Hi. I'm so sorry, OK?

15:41.810 --> 15:43.420
So this is a list
of people questioned

15:43.420 --> 15:46.858
the night of the murder,
but there is a page missing.

15:46.858 --> 15:48.295
What do you think?
You think it means something?

15:48.295 --> 15:49.731
Absolutely.

15:49.731 --> 15:51.907
It means ADA Barnes
is hiding evidence.

15:51.907 --> 15:52.995
Yes!

15:52.995 --> 15:55.824
Or an intern forgot
to copy it.

15:55.824 --> 15:57.478
You think they'd
give it to me if I asked?

15:57.478 --> 16:00.176
Well, if they don't,
it means you're onto something.

16:02.483 --> 16:03.658
Ben, if that's true

16:03.658 --> 16:04.964
and they're hiding
important evidence,

16:04.964 --> 16:06.400
that makes it
a Brady violation.

16:06.400 --> 16:07.923
We might even be able
to get the case thrown out.

16:07.923 --> 16:10.230
Or like he said,
an intern forgot to copy it.

16:10.230 --> 16:13.146
I just don't think Vicky
would do something like this.

16:13.146 --> 16:15.583
Bury evidence
just to win a case?

16:15.583 --> 16:17.585
I need to see
if there's a second page.

16:17.585 --> 16:18.978
Ian, can you get
on that missing page?

16:18.978 --> 16:21.458
And I need to go find Vicky.

16:21.458 --> 16:23.069
Ben, hang on.

16:23.069 --> 16:25.071
You remember Tyler, the guy
that got locked outside naked

16:25.071 --> 16:26.768
by his girlfriend?
They need our help.

16:26.768 --> 16:29.336
And if Addison were here, she
would say, "Stay on mission."

16:29.336 --> 16:31.555
Yeah, but Ziggy says
if Tyler doesn't make bail,

16:31.555 --> 16:32.817
he gets beat up
at Rikers next week

16:32.817 --> 16:34.167
and ends up
in a wheelchair for life.

16:36.647 --> 16:37.997
Aleyda?

16:37.997 --> 16:39.694
Tyler's mother won't help,

16:39.694 --> 16:42.175
and that bail bonds guy
wants $5,000.

16:42.175 --> 16:44.177
Oh, Rose, I'm so sorry.

16:44.177 --> 16:46.048
I really wish
there was something I could do.

16:46.048 --> 16:48.355
There is.
We got Marty McFly's almanac.

16:48.355 --> 16:49.747
- Huh?
- Just give her

16:49.747 --> 16:51.880
the 50 bucks in your pocket
and write this down.

16:51.880 --> 16:54.404
Could I see your paper, please?

16:54.404 --> 16:55.666
Thank you.

16:55.666 --> 16:58.060
OK, Belmont.
Race 8. Superfecta.

16:58.060 --> 17:01.063
Numbers 3, 7, 9, 1,
in that order.

17:01.063 --> 17:03.152
And there's an OTB
three miles away.

17:03.152 --> 17:04.284
She'll win $5,000.

17:04.284 --> 17:06.895
A whole $5,000?

17:06.895 --> 17:10.507
Is what I should not be able
to provide as a lawyer,

17:10.507 --> 17:13.249
but I got a tip from a friend.

17:13.249 --> 17:16.296
So place this bet
at the off-track betting,

17:16.296 --> 17:18.515
and you'll be able
to cover Tyler's bail.

17:18.515 --> 17:19.734
Ta-da.

17:19.734 --> 17:21.605
Go!
- OK, thank you.

17:24.434 --> 17:26.915
What? You've never
done that in a leap before?

17:26.915 --> 17:28.569
- Aleyda?
- Vicky, hi.

17:28.569 --> 17:30.223
I was hoping to find you.

17:30.223 --> 17:32.790
Look, um, I just got a call
from the precinct.

17:32.790 --> 17:35.141
Camilo Diaz's brother
was just arrested.

17:48.893 --> 17:51.070
Um, you're welcome.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.158
Yeah, I'm 16.

17:52.158 --> 17:53.246
What are
they gonna do about it?

17:53.246 --> 17:54.508
What are they
gonna do about it?

17:54.508 --> 17:55.944
Leo, if they catch you
working that corner,

17:55.944 --> 17:57.772
dealing drugs, you'll be put
in juvenile detention.

17:57.772 --> 17:59.861
You should have told Camilo
to take the deal!

17:59.861 --> 18:01.384
He would have been out in ten,
and now,

18:01.384 --> 18:02.559
he doesn't have a chance.
- OK, so what?

18:02.559 --> 18:04.300
You think dealing drugs
is the answer?

18:04.300 --> 18:05.954
Are you stupid?

18:05.954 --> 18:07.303
Camilo is gone.

18:07.303 --> 18:09.740
We don't have money.
I don't have a choice.

18:09.740 --> 18:12.091
Besides, they promised to
keep Camilo safe on the inside.

18:12.091 --> 18:14.397
OK. Please, Leo,
we'll find another way.

18:14.397 --> 18:15.529
Don't give up yet.

18:15.529 --> 18:16.921
Just give me one more day, please.

18:18.836 --> 18:21.752
You know, I wish my brother
had just killed Nathan.

18:21.752 --> 18:24.886
Viento Este,
they would have left me alone.

18:24.886 --> 18:26.148
Why do you say that?

18:26.148 --> 18:29.369
Because Nathan was a snitch.

18:29.369 --> 18:31.110
The whole street knows it.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.764
It was only a matter of time.

18:35.418 --> 18:37.464
I gotta go help my grandma.

18:41.555 --> 18:44.558
We think the victim was
a CI working for police,

18:44.558 --> 18:47.387
but there wasn't anything
in the case files about it.

18:47.387 --> 18:49.345
Well, police like
to protect their CIs.

18:49.345 --> 18:51.434
They may not have
told the DA's office,

18:51.434 --> 18:52.914
not if it wasn't relevant.

18:52.914 --> 18:55.003
Well, Ziggy says
there's an 82% chance

18:55.003 --> 18:58.137
he was killed
because he was informing.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.486
Good timing.

18:59.486 --> 19:01.792
The DA's office
just found that missing page.

19:01.792 --> 19:05.492
And here it is.
- Ah, see?

19:05.492 --> 19:07.798
Not all slow and boring
on the other side, is it?

19:07.798 --> 19:10.627
OK, this is it.
This is the second page.

19:10.627 --> 19:12.063
And these are
the remaining names

19:12.063 --> 19:13.935
of everyone the detectives
interviewed that night.

19:13.935 --> 19:15.371
And there's a name
blacked out.

19:15.371 --> 19:18.069
Yeah, but because they
crossed it out with marker,

19:18.069 --> 19:19.984
a simple photo editing program

19:19.984 --> 19:22.465
can separate the colors
and the saturation levels

19:22.465 --> 19:25.425
in order
to reveal the name below.

19:25.425 --> 19:26.643
Edwin Soto.

19:26.643 --> 19:28.602
Edwin Soto,
28 years old.

19:28.602 --> 19:30.647
He's an enforcer
for the Viento Este gang

19:30.647 --> 19:32.693
and a suspect in
two other gang-related murders.

19:32.693 --> 19:34.782
Ben, this could be our guy.

19:34.782 --> 19:37.611
So I need to ask Vicky what
Edwin Soto said to the police

19:37.611 --> 19:39.308
and why he was brought in
for questioning.

19:39.308 --> 19:42.529
And if she balks, then you
know they hid it on purpose.

19:48.578 --> 19:51.581
Oh. How'd it go
with Camilo's brother?

19:51.581 --> 19:54.193
Wow. That good, huh?

19:54.193 --> 19:56.107
I left you some Chinese food.

19:56.107 --> 19:58.240
Thank you.

19:58.240 --> 19:59.981
Oh, uh-uh. No, no.

19:59.981 --> 20:02.157
We need to draw a line
the next few days,

20:02.157 --> 20:03.332
I already stuck my neck out
telling you

20:03.332 --> 20:04.464
about Camilo's brother.

20:06.117 --> 20:07.902
Thank you for doing that.

20:12.994 --> 20:17.259
I just need to ask
one, tiny favor more.

20:19.043 --> 20:22.525
You are really dying
to just break the rules, huh?

20:22.525 --> 20:24.658
And tonight of all nights.

20:27.965 --> 20:30.838
Look, Aleyda,

20:30.838 --> 20:34.320
these four walls,
they're a sanctuary,

20:34.320 --> 20:36.626
the only place
that's just for us,

20:36.626 --> 20:38.846
away
from the reproachful looks,

20:38.846 --> 20:40.630
away from the chaos at work.

20:42.284 --> 20:44.243
And I love that we have that.

20:44.243 --> 20:45.940
Let's not mess it up.

20:48.290 --> 20:51.815
And that would be Barnes.

20:56.820 --> 20:58.257
Hello?

20:58.257 --> 20:59.562
Mm-hmm.

21:01.608 --> 21:03.610
Come on.
Let's take a teeny, tiny peek.

21:05.960 --> 21:08.615
See what Edwin Soto
said to the police.

21:10.965 --> 21:13.533
No, I can't betray
Vicky's trust.

21:13.533 --> 21:16.187
Ben, this is our only lead.
You mess this up,

21:16.187 --> 21:18.277
and Camilo goes to prison
for 30-plus years.

21:18.277 --> 21:22.106
And he never sees his brother
or grandmother again.

21:25.458 --> 21:27.503
Vicky?

21:27.503 --> 21:29.592
What did Edwin Soto
say to the police?

21:31.159 --> 21:32.769
Did you just look
at my files?

21:32.769 --> 21:34.641
What?
No, absolutely not.

21:34.641 --> 21:35.729
Then
where did you get that name?

21:35.729 --> 21:37.339
He got it from the future.

21:37.339 --> 21:38.775
Hang on.

21:38.775 --> 21:40.647
Are you saying
that you hid this?

21:40.647 --> 21:42.301
Why would you do that?

21:42.301 --> 21:45.216
Aleyda, I did not hide this.

21:45.216 --> 21:47.567
Besides, he didn't
tell the police anything,

21:47.567 --> 21:48.872
so there's nothing to hide.

21:48.872 --> 21:50.309
What about the fact
that he was a suspect

21:50.309 --> 21:52.702
in two other murders,
or that the victim was

21:52.702 --> 21:54.138
an informant for the police?
- OK, stop.

21:54.138 --> 21:55.662
Aleyda, please stop.

21:55.662 --> 21:57.620
I can't talk to you
about this case.

21:57.620 --> 21:58.752
I can't help you with it,

21:58.752 --> 22:00.144
and it's not fair
for you to ask me.

22:00.144 --> 22:02.364
- You didn't hide this?
- I promise you.

22:02.364 --> 22:04.018
I didn't hide anything.

22:04.018 --> 22:06.673
So ADA Barnes just asked you
to leave out the page,

22:06.673 --> 22:08.196
and you didn't bother
to ask why?

22:13.462 --> 22:17.510
You know, I think it's best
I get a hotel room tonight.

22:20.817 --> 22:22.689
Happy anniversary.

22:27.084 --> 22:30.610
I really hope we're right,
because I just blew up

22:30.610 --> 22:33.526
Aleyda and Vicky's relationship
for this.

22:42.448 --> 22:44.319
Stuart?

22:44.319 --> 22:45.581
Hey, Stuart?

22:45.581 --> 22:48.018
Did you sleep here last night?

22:48.018 --> 22:49.846
Do you need a subway token
to get home?

22:49.846 --> 22:52.632
I don't need a subway token.
I need my bike.

22:52.632 --> 22:54.416
I'm not leaving here
until I have it.

22:54.416 --> 22:57.027
Yeah, I'm really sorry
about yesterday.

22:57.027 --> 22:58.855
Things have been
a little crazy for me,

22:58.855 --> 23:01.380
but I'm realizing that's
what normal is around here.

23:01.380 --> 23:04.470
Please, I promised my uncle.

23:04.470 --> 23:06.123
I need to do this.

23:06.123 --> 23:07.864
I'm sorry.
I don't follow.

23:07.864 --> 23:09.475
The charity ride.

23:09.475 --> 23:13.392
We're raising money for AIDS.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.959
My uncle, he passed last year.

23:15.959 --> 23:17.091
There's a conference
in Atlanta,

23:17.091 --> 23:18.701
the first of its kind ever
for AIDS,

23:18.701 --> 23:21.051
and the cross-country tour
leaves from there.

23:22.488 --> 23:24.794
I'll get your bike back, OK?

23:24.794 --> 23:27.406
May take a few hours,
but I'll get it back.

23:27.406 --> 23:29.843
I promise.
- Thank you.

23:34.456 --> 23:35.631
Hey. Hey, what's going on?

23:35.631 --> 23:37.459
I've been here for ages.
Leo's OK?

23:37.459 --> 23:38.852
Sorry. Yes.

23:38.852 --> 23:40.767
Well, no, Leo was arrested.

23:40.767 --> 23:42.377
But I got him out.
He's fine.

23:42.377 --> 23:44.466
Look, I don't have much time.
- You have to talk to him.

23:44.466 --> 23:46.294
If he starts dealing, I--

23:46.294 --> 23:47.904
Look, my parents are gone,
all right?

23:47.904 --> 23:49.558
I have to make sure
that he's safe.

23:49.558 --> 23:50.864
Please talk to him.

23:50.864 --> 23:52.996
I will. I promise.

23:54.389 --> 23:57.740
Camilo, do you know
the name Edwin Soto?

23:57.740 --> 23:59.307
He's a Viento Este gang member.

23:59.307 --> 24:00.656
I don't know any of them.

24:00.656 --> 24:03.485
I've stayed away from them
as much as possible.

24:03.485 --> 24:05.835
Wait. This is Edwin Soto?
- Mm-hmm.

24:05.835 --> 24:07.097
He's the guy that was

24:07.097 --> 24:08.751
hanging around the building
that night.

24:08.751 --> 24:10.013
Why didn't you tell us
you saw someone?

24:10.013 --> 24:12.146
I did.
I told you that.

24:12.146 --> 24:14.322
But no one else saw him,
so police thought I made it up.

24:14.322 --> 24:16.759
Well, they hid his name from
us, and I'm gonna prove it.

24:16.759 --> 24:18.239
It's a Brady violation.

24:18.239 --> 24:19.980
They purposefully
withheld the page

24:19.980 --> 24:22.025
from the list of people
detectives questioned.

24:22.025 --> 24:24.593
And we believe the police
spoke to someone that night

24:24.593 --> 24:26.856
who should be a suspect.
- Really?

24:26.856 --> 24:29.119
That's what all this nonsense
is about, a missing page?

24:29.119 --> 24:30.904
You could have just asked
for the page.

24:30.904 --> 24:34.298
Is this really what I got
out of bed early for?

24:34.298 --> 24:37.650
Barnes, give her the page.
- Yeah, of course.

24:37.650 --> 24:38.781
You said it was
the list of people

24:38.781 --> 24:40.566
that detectives questioned?

24:40.566 --> 24:44.744
I don't want to jinx things,
but this feels way too easy.

24:44.744 --> 24:46.354
Where is ADA Davis
this morning?

24:46.354 --> 24:49.836
She no longer works
for the DA's office.

24:49.836 --> 24:52.012
This the page
you're looking for?

24:55.581 --> 24:57.365
That a-hole deleted the name!

24:57.365 --> 24:58.671
Don't say anything.

24:58.671 --> 24:59.759
You can't let him know
you've seen his files.

24:59.759 --> 25:01.804
It could mean a mistrial.

25:02.892 --> 25:04.981
Is everything in order,
Councilor?

25:07.462 --> 25:09.682
Yes, Your Honor.

25:16.602 --> 25:18.517
Do Aleyda and Vicky break up?

25:18.517 --> 25:21.563
Jenn, tell me
what happens to Vicky.

25:21.563 --> 25:23.609
ADA Barnes blackballs her.

25:23.609 --> 25:26.481
She can't find another job.
She moves back to Kentucky.

25:26.481 --> 25:27.874
Never practices law again.

25:30.354 --> 25:32.443
Ben, please say something.

25:32.443 --> 25:33.880
What should I say?

25:33.880 --> 25:36.796
ADA Barnes is corrupt
and I have nothing.

25:36.796 --> 25:38.275
I've ruined
Aleyda's relationship,

25:38.275 --> 25:40.930
Vicky's career,
Camilo's life.

25:40.930 --> 25:42.628
And I'm traveling
through time and space,

25:42.628 --> 25:44.281
and I don't know
where I'm going

25:44.281 --> 25:45.979
or what I'm supposed to do
when I get there.

25:45.979 --> 25:47.241
Well, I'm not sure
what to say either.

25:47.241 --> 25:49.330
I'm terrible at speeches.

25:51.680 --> 25:54.291
It does remind me of a story
about drowning bunnies.

25:54.291 --> 25:56.729
No, hang on.
It's just one bunny.

25:56.729 --> 25:58.687
There's a boy,
and he sees a bunny.

25:58.687 --> 26:00.820
And he saves a bunny
from the river.

26:00.820 --> 26:03.039
But then the next day,
he sees another bunny.

26:03.039 --> 26:06.434
But he saves that bunny too,
and then another, and another.

26:06.434 --> 26:08.001
I'm going somewhere with this.
I promise.

26:08.001 --> 26:10.873
So the boy learns
that there's a farmer upstream

26:10.873 --> 26:12.440
who's throwing bunnies
in the river

26:12.440 --> 26:14.616
after he learns
that they're eating his crops.

26:14.616 --> 26:17.401
So what's the answer?

26:17.401 --> 26:19.316
Is this a story
or a brainteaser?

26:19.316 --> 26:20.579
A story.

26:20.579 --> 26:21.841
If he goes upstream

26:21.841 --> 26:23.582
to see if the farmer
will change his ways,

26:23.582 --> 26:25.671
then the bunnies in the river
will all drown.

26:25.671 --> 26:28.064
See? There is no right answer.

26:28.064 --> 26:29.413
Is that the end

26:29.413 --> 26:30.327
of your story?
- Yeah.

26:30.327 --> 26:32.939
OK.

26:32.939 --> 26:36.116
I-I don't get it.

26:36.116 --> 26:38.640
The answer is you, Ben,

26:38.640 --> 26:40.816
because you are doing both,

26:40.816 --> 26:43.166
leap after leap,
saving bunnies from the river,

26:43.166 --> 26:44.603
but you're also
running upstream

26:44.603 --> 26:46.430
trying to change
what will happen in the future.

26:46.430 --> 26:50.478
You're doing both,
and it's exhausting.

26:50.478 --> 26:52.262
But the fact
that you can do both

26:52.262 --> 26:55.614
is what makes you
all the more a hero.

26:55.614 --> 26:59.356
You just gotta trust
that there's a way out of this.

26:59.356 --> 27:01.358
I know
you'll be the one to find it.

27:04.057 --> 27:06.320
Thank you, Jenn.

27:09.932 --> 27:14.589
Well, what do we know?

27:14.589 --> 27:17.418
We know for sure
ADA Barnes is corrupt.

27:17.418 --> 27:18.898
He's definitely a slimebag.

27:18.898 --> 27:20.464
And your Vicky
wasn't a part of it.

27:20.464 --> 27:22.466
Well,
because Vicky was fired.

27:22.466 --> 27:24.512
Yes, I was.

27:26.340 --> 27:28.342
I'm so sorry.

27:28.342 --> 27:31.127
I couldn't help it.
I put you first.

27:31.127 --> 27:33.303
I asked him
to hand over the missing page.

27:33.303 --> 27:35.654
Now he's convinced I'm the one
who told you about it.

27:35.654 --> 27:38.918
I've lost my mentor, my career.

27:38.918 --> 27:40.702
And all for what?

27:40.702 --> 27:42.661
A missing page
that gets you nothing?

27:42.661 --> 27:44.314
You blew up our lives for that?

27:44.314 --> 27:46.273
If it is nothing,

27:46.273 --> 27:48.667
then why did he delete
Edwin's name from the page?

27:48.667 --> 27:50.756
What are you talking about?

28:02.898 --> 28:04.421
Wow.

28:04.421 --> 28:05.640
I know.

28:05.640 --> 28:08.599
He was your mentor, and--

28:08.599 --> 28:10.166
I'm sorry, but Vicky,

28:10.166 --> 28:13.779
please, why is he trying
so hard to hide his name?

28:13.779 --> 28:16.216
He said
it wasn't relevant to the case,

28:16.216 --> 28:18.566
that it would only distract
the jury from the truth.

28:18.566 --> 28:21.003
And I mean, I believed him.
It's just that he...

28:24.441 --> 28:26.356
He just wants the win.

28:26.356 --> 28:27.749
This guy, Edwin Soto,

28:27.749 --> 28:29.969
he's a suspect in
two other gang-related murders.

28:29.969 --> 28:31.927
Is that
why the police questioned him?

28:34.234 --> 28:36.366
It is.

28:36.366 --> 28:37.716
But there's nothing else.

28:37.716 --> 28:39.195
He didn't say anything
to police.

28:39.195 --> 28:41.110
He wasn't seen by anyone.

28:41.110 --> 28:42.372
There's absolutely nothing

28:42.372 --> 28:44.157
connecting him to this murder,
just rumors.

28:44.157 --> 28:46.855
So ADA Barnes is just
gonna let Camilo take the fall?

28:46.855 --> 28:49.466
And he will,

28:49.466 --> 28:52.034
unless you can
make that connection.

28:52.034 --> 28:54.167
Huh.

28:54.167 --> 28:58.737
If only there was some way
to look into the past

28:58.737 --> 29:02.871
and see how Edwin Soto did it.

29:02.871 --> 29:04.351
I'm on it.

29:04.351 --> 29:05.787
We got something Ben can use.

29:05.787 --> 29:08.877
It's a news article
from 11 years later, in 1996,

29:08.877 --> 29:11.880
about the gun that Edwin Soto
used on the two murders.

29:11.880 --> 29:14.578
Now, a kid that lived
in Edwin Soto's building

29:14.578 --> 29:16.755
found the gun stashed
in the basement,

29:16.755 --> 29:18.626
and then he showed up
to school with it.

29:18.626 --> 29:20.759
And they linked the gun
to the two murders,

29:20.759 --> 29:23.196
and Soto's DNA
was found all over it.

29:23.196 --> 29:24.588
Wait, that's great.

29:24.588 --> 29:27.200
What if he used
that same gun on our victim?

29:27.200 --> 29:28.941
Maybe, but Ben is in 1985,

29:28.941 --> 29:30.986
and DNA analysis
isn't around yet.

29:30.986 --> 29:35.034
OK, but if ballistics can
match the gun to the bullet,

29:35.034 --> 29:36.165
we have a murder weapon.

29:36.165 --> 29:37.601
Yes. Yeah, yeah.

29:37.601 --> 29:39.038
But what are the chances

29:39.038 --> 29:41.605
that the gun is
in the exact same place

29:41.605 --> 29:43.912
11 years earlier, in 1985?

29:43.912 --> 29:45.087
Mm.

29:51.877 --> 29:54.444
- All right. All right.
- Tyler, you're out.

29:54.444 --> 29:55.794
That's great.
both: Yeah.

29:55.794 --> 29:57.883
The racing bet worked.
Can you believe it?

29:57.883 --> 29:59.667
- I'm glad I could help.
- Yeah.

29:59.667 --> 30:01.843
And Tyler has a question
for you.

30:01.843 --> 30:03.976
All right, ma'am,
you know, we're just trying

30:03.976 --> 30:05.499
to get a break, you know?
- Mm-hmm.

30:05.499 --> 30:06.935
So we were just wondering

30:06.935 --> 30:09.982
if maybe you can
give us another tip.

30:12.419 --> 30:15.204
Here's my tip:
show up to court.

30:15.204 --> 30:16.510
That's all you have to do.

30:16.510 --> 30:18.686
Then you'll get
your bail money back, OK?

30:18.686 --> 30:20.601
OK. Bad bunny.

30:20.601 --> 30:21.994
See? I told you.

30:21.994 --> 30:23.386
You look like
you might have some good news.

30:23.386 --> 30:24.648
Yes, I have great news.

30:24.648 --> 30:26.172
I got your bike back.

30:26.172 --> 30:27.956
But there's a catch:
I need a favor.

30:27.956 --> 30:30.654
Traffic's crazy, and I have
one hour to get across town.

30:42.710 --> 30:44.843
Come on.
Might need a witness.

30:47.410 --> 30:48.542
The boy found the gun

30:48.542 --> 30:50.152
in the southwest corner
of the basement.

30:50.152 --> 30:51.850
The gun was
in a brown paper bag

30:51.850 --> 30:53.764
that was taped
to the inside of an AC vent.

30:53.764 --> 30:56.158
AC vent. OK.

31:00.902 --> 31:03.513
No. No, it has to be here.

31:03.513 --> 31:04.863
Please.
- What?

31:04.863 --> 31:06.865
Is this
what you're looking for?

31:06.865 --> 31:08.170
I guess
it was the northwest corner.

31:08.170 --> 31:09.389
Don't open it!

31:09.389 --> 31:10.869
Does it feel like
there's a gun in there?

31:10.869 --> 31:13.523
Yeah, it does.
Is that bad?

31:13.523 --> 31:14.568
It's amazing.

31:14.568 --> 31:15.786
We gotta go.

31:25.013 --> 31:27.015
- So this is the time, right?
- Huh?

31:27.015 --> 31:28.190
When Addison tells you
to give someone

31:28.190 --> 31:30.105
one
of those famous Ben pep talks.

31:30.105 --> 31:35.067
Very funny,
but I did promise Camilo.

31:42.465 --> 31:43.902
What's taking so long?

31:43.902 --> 31:46.165
Well, we're still waiting
for ballistics on the gun

31:46.165 --> 31:47.906
to be rushed through,

31:47.906 --> 31:51.083
but I believe
it's the murder weapon.

31:51.083 --> 31:53.172
No,
it's not gonna be enough.

31:53.172 --> 31:54.521
No, I know it.

31:54.521 --> 31:59.352
Leo, I know how hard
it can be to have hope.

31:59.352 --> 32:01.745
Hope that things
will get better.

32:01.745 --> 32:05.053
Hope that you'll get
a fair shot at life.

32:05.053 --> 32:08.578
But it is helpful to have hope,
even if you can't see it.

32:08.578 --> 32:10.885
I don't believe
in anything I can't see.

32:12.408 --> 32:14.889
Have you ever heard
how plants grow more

32:14.889 --> 32:18.632
if you play them music?
- What?

32:18.632 --> 32:19.589
No. Yeah.
No, it's true.

32:19.589 --> 32:21.417
Here. Scooch.

32:21.417 --> 32:24.377
The sound waves
stimulate the plant cells,

32:24.377 --> 32:26.770
which allow for the nutrients
to move around the plant,

32:26.770 --> 32:28.250
promoting more growth.

32:28.250 --> 32:31.993
You can't see the music,
but you can feel it.

32:31.993 --> 32:36.389
And allowing yourself
to feel hope helps.

32:36.389 --> 32:40.959
It helps you to see
that things can change.

32:40.959 --> 32:43.657
And sometimes
that change is for the better.

32:47.356 --> 32:48.836
Counselor.

32:51.665 --> 32:53.275
Did we get
the ballistics back?

32:53.275 --> 32:54.363
Not yet.

32:54.363 --> 32:55.669
For what it's worth,

32:55.669 --> 32:57.018
you may have helped me
on another two cases,

32:57.018 --> 32:58.280
so I'm gonna throw you a bone.

32:58.280 --> 33:00.108
I'll make it a B-felony.

33:00.108 --> 33:02.676
Five years.
He'll get parole in four.

33:02.676 --> 33:04.678
It's the deal of a century.

33:04.678 --> 33:06.680
I can't believe you.

33:06.680 --> 33:09.291
Camilo is innocent,
and you know it.

33:09.291 --> 33:12.294
Do your job and present the
deal to your client, Counselor.

33:12.294 --> 33:13.643
He'll take it.

33:13.643 --> 33:15.428
They always do.

33:20.999 --> 33:23.479
Ben, Ziggy says if you
take this plea, you can leap.

33:23.479 --> 33:24.524
What?

33:24.524 --> 33:26.569
This allows me to leap? This?

33:26.569 --> 33:28.049
Camilo gets out
in four years.

33:28.049 --> 33:29.833
He moves his grandmother
and his brother out of Queens

33:29.833 --> 33:31.922
before Leo ever gets killed.

33:31.922 --> 33:34.273
It takes years, but
they build their lives back.

33:34.273 --> 33:37.667
Yeah, but it's still
four years in prison.

33:37.667 --> 33:39.234
Camilo is only 18.

33:40.714 --> 33:44.065
What if we don't take the deal?
What does Ziggy say?

33:46.067 --> 33:47.634
It's a coin toss.

33:47.634 --> 33:50.463
He's got a 50/50 chance
of going away for life.

33:58.340 --> 33:59.776
They just make it harder
every time.

33:59.776 --> 34:02.040
Now it's four years.
But if I lose, it's 30.

34:02.040 --> 34:04.825
It just makes the four
so much harder to turn down.

34:04.825 --> 34:06.392
It does, but still,

34:06.392 --> 34:09.003
four years is too long
for an innocent person.

34:09.003 --> 34:10.570
No one cares if I'm innocent!

34:12.702 --> 34:15.096
So I should
just take this deal.

34:15.096 --> 34:17.185
- Is that what you want?
- No.

34:17.185 --> 34:18.708
I want my brother to be safe.

34:18.708 --> 34:21.015
I want him out of Queens.
I want him to stay in school.

34:21.015 --> 34:23.757
He's so smart,
so much smarter than I am.

34:23.757 --> 34:28.675
Well, none of that happens
if you go away.

34:28.675 --> 34:30.981
If I go away,
he's a 16-year-old kid

34:30.981 --> 34:34.594
working the corner.

34:34.594 --> 34:37.379
And I can't live with that.

34:37.379 --> 34:39.425
So then, let's fight.

34:43.168 --> 34:44.343
I could have leapt.

34:44.343 --> 34:46.432
Why didn't you push me
to take the deal?

34:46.432 --> 34:48.303
I want to see
that kid free as well.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.002
One more time then,
for good measure.

34:52.002 --> 34:53.700
Let's do it.

34:59.619 --> 35:01.751
We all feel
a deep responsibility

35:01.751 --> 35:03.362
to those we love.

35:06.191 --> 35:08.845
I'll give you two some space.

35:08.845 --> 35:11.152
I didn't expect
to see you back here.

35:11.152 --> 35:13.807
Yeah, I was, uh,
pretty angry this morning.

35:16.114 --> 35:18.028
But you were right.

35:18.028 --> 35:19.769
ADA Barnes is a cheat,

35:19.769 --> 35:23.164
and I was blind to it
because I admired him so much.

35:23.164 --> 35:24.644
And I'm sorry.

35:24.644 --> 35:27.908
Well, there's really
only one thing I need to know.

35:29.475 --> 35:32.130
Did you reschedule
our anniversary dinner

35:32.130 --> 35:33.087
for Saturday?

35:35.916 --> 35:37.352
Not yet, but I will.

35:39.137 --> 35:40.094
Here.

35:49.451 --> 35:51.018
May I?

35:55.675 --> 35:57.503
Stand strong in there.

35:57.503 --> 35:59.505
Juries are quick
to judge women,

35:59.505 --> 36:02.029
especially young ones like us,

36:02.029 --> 36:03.857
so you really have
to own that space.

36:06.338 --> 36:08.992
Thank you, Vicky.

36:08.992 --> 36:10.342
Good luck.

36:22.484 --> 36:24.399
We all feel
a deep responsibility

36:24.399 --> 36:26.532
to those we love.

36:29.099 --> 36:30.362
I know I do.

36:32.190 --> 36:36.150
I would travel to the end
of time for the people I love.

36:36.150 --> 36:38.631
I strive to see them succeed.

36:38.631 --> 36:42.591
And when they hurt, I hurt.

36:42.591 --> 36:44.332
Camilo is no different.

36:44.332 --> 36:46.421
He is fighting

36:46.421 --> 36:48.467
to lift his brother up
out of circumstance.

36:48.467 --> 36:50.686
And yes, he made a mistake.

36:50.686 --> 36:53.036
He threatened
a violent gang member

36:53.036 --> 36:57.476
who was forcing his teenage
brother into a life of crime.

36:57.476 --> 36:59.913
But Camilo is not a murderer.

37:01.697 --> 37:03.351
And the murder weapon,
which we now have,

37:03.351 --> 37:05.135
does not belong to him.

37:08.617 --> 37:11.359
Camilo is a committed brother

37:11.359 --> 37:13.187
who makes every decision

37:13.187 --> 37:16.538
with careful consideration
and planning.

37:16.538 --> 37:19.062
Like the choice
to drop out of school at 15

37:19.062 --> 37:21.804
and work two jobs so
he could keep his family afloat

37:21.804 --> 37:23.676
and his brother in school.

37:23.676 --> 37:26.896
Like writing down every dollar
he makes in his notebook

37:26.896 --> 37:29.856
so he can budget
for his family's future.

37:29.856 --> 37:33.163
And when facing life in prison,

37:33.163 --> 37:36.297
his only question was,

37:36.297 --> 37:40.649
"Who will be there
for my brother?"

37:40.649 --> 37:45.567
Camilo Diaz devotes his life
to those he loves.

37:45.567 --> 37:47.265
Let's not take that all away

37:47.265 --> 37:51.791
because he found himself at the
wrong place at the wrong time.

37:59.494 --> 38:00.887
Careful. They're hot.

38:00.887 --> 38:02.628
You think?

38:10.157 --> 38:13.116
Any distraction
would be most helpful.

38:14.466 --> 38:16.119
I missed you.

38:16.119 --> 38:17.860
Pretty sure
I missed you more.

38:19.122 --> 38:22.038
- So how was Jenn?
- Jenn was great.

38:22.038 --> 38:24.345
But she completely
butchered Magic's story.

38:24.345 --> 38:25.694
You know the one
Magic always tells

38:25.694 --> 38:28.131
about that boy who saves
rabbits along the river--

38:28.131 --> 38:31.613
Ben,
you just remembered Magic.

38:31.613 --> 38:33.876
I just remembered Magic.

38:33.876 --> 38:36.618
Aleyda,
they're looking for you.

38:36.618 --> 38:38.490
The jury has a verdict.

38:47.150 --> 38:49.283
Your closing was good.

38:49.283 --> 38:51.241
Thank you.

38:51.241 --> 38:54.288
I'm sorry you had
to lose your job over all this.

38:54.288 --> 38:57.552
Well, ADA Barnes
will be losing his too.

38:57.552 --> 38:58.814
I found eight other cases

38:58.814 --> 39:00.816
where he withheld
exculpatory evidence.

39:00.816 --> 39:02.209
I took it to the DA.

39:05.734 --> 39:07.606
I'm really proud of you, Vicky.

39:18.617 --> 39:21.184
OK, and now Ziggy
is searching for Ben.

39:21.184 --> 39:24.144
Mm, I believe
you all owe me money.

39:24.144 --> 39:27.669
Why? I didn't say
"Leaper X" again, did I?

39:27.669 --> 39:29.323
No,
Ben remembered Magic first.

39:29.323 --> 39:31.586
And honestly,
I can't believe I lost.

39:31.586 --> 39:32.805
I spent
two whole days with him.

39:32.805 --> 39:34.633
And then I tell one story
about bunnies--

39:34.633 --> 39:35.851
- Badly.
- And poof,

39:35.851 --> 39:37.375
he remembers Magic.

39:38.854 --> 39:43.076
Addison, did I thank you
for helping me face my past?

39:43.076 --> 39:45.426
No, thank you.

39:45.426 --> 39:47.341
You helped me remember

39:47.341 --> 39:51.780
that doing what's best
doesn't always feel right.

39:51.780 --> 39:56.132
But me stepping aside was...

39:56.132 --> 39:59.048
And I believe
you should do the honors.

40:04.706 --> 40:06.621
Camilo was found not guilty.

40:06.621 --> 40:09.711
Leo became the first member
in his family to go to college

40:09.711 --> 40:12.322
and becomes a lawyer.

40:12.322 --> 40:14.412
I imagine spending time
in that courtroom

40:14.412 --> 40:15.717
had an effect on him.

40:15.717 --> 40:18.981
ADA Barnes, obviously,
went down for corruption,

40:18.981 --> 40:21.244
Edwin Soto went down
for all three murders, and...

40:24.509 --> 40:28.904
And, uh, Aleyda and Vicky
joined the Innocence Project,

40:28.904 --> 40:33.039
helping those who are
wrongly accused find freedom.

40:39.219 --> 40:40.829
Ugh.

40:40.829 --> 40:42.788
I saw that.

40:42.788 --> 40:45.051
Sorry.

40:45.051 --> 40:46.792
You know
what I realized most of all?

40:46.792 --> 40:49.664
I realized I really miss Ben.

41:02.634 --> 41:04.549
Normal reflexes.

41:04.549 --> 41:07.595
Normal dilation.

41:07.595 --> 41:11.251
Hmm, we will confirm
with bloodwork,

41:11.251 --> 41:13.035
but it appears
that your husband

41:13.035 --> 41:15.255
is at least physically healthy,
Mrs. O'Connor.

41:15.255 --> 41:17.518
It's not his body
I'm worried about.

41:17.518 --> 41:20.478
My husband is clearly
not in his right mind.

41:20.478 --> 41:22.480
Right mind?
Of course I'm in my right mind.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.438
Why would I be of wrong mind?

41:24.438 --> 41:26.614
OK, I think
I should probably go, right?

41:26.614 --> 41:28.007
Liam! Liam, you need help.

41:28.007 --> 41:29.878
They're going
to make you feel better here.

41:29.878 --> 41:32.315
Can you help him or not?
- I can.

41:32.315 --> 41:34.927
And I would like to begin
treatments immediately.
