09:03.040 --> 09:03.920
Mmm.

09:04.079 --> 09:05.360
And delicious.

09:05.480 --> 09:06.560
[sighs]

09:06.720 --> 09:08.079
If only I could take a picture of it!

09:08.199 --> 09:09.360
What am I going to do?

09:09.720 --> 09:11.280
Things couldn't get worse!

09:11.400 --> 09:12.240
Ah!

09:12.400 --> 09:13.240
[monkey gibbers]

09:13.360 --> 09:14.439
Things got worse.

09:14.560 --> 09:16.240
Hey Ollie, look at this.

09:16.360 --> 09:17.880
The camera's broken,

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
but you can see the pictures

09:20.120 --> 09:21.360
that monkey took.

09:21.520 --> 09:23.319
Some of these are funny!

09:23.480 --> 09:25.959
That's a good one of pink lake.

09:26.120 --> 09:26.959
Yeah!

09:27.079 --> 09:28.240
[Ollie] Look at that one!

09:29.520 --> 09:30.360
But,

09:30.480 --> 09:32.800
they're blurry and they have
monkey thumb in them...

09:32.959 --> 09:33.800
True.

09:33.959 --> 09:35.720
They're not perfect.

09:35.839 --> 09:37.959
After all, a monkey took them.

09:38.120 --> 09:39.319
They're still pretty great.

09:39.480 --> 09:40.400
Yeah,

09:40.520 --> 09:42.439
they remind me of an old saying:

09:42.560 --> 09:46.040
the worst day makes the best story.

09:46.160 --> 09:48.839
The worst day makes the best story.

09:48.959 --> 09:49.920
Bouba!

09:50.079 --> 09:51.600
You just gave me a great idea!

09:51.760 --> 09:53.040
Thank you!

09:53.199 --> 09:55.199
I'm ready for the Explorer's Club meeting!

09:55.319 --> 09:56.640
You, you are?

09:56.760 --> 09:59.120
Even without your perfect pink picture?

09:59.240 --> 10:00.520
I don't need it anymore, Moon.

10:00.640 --> 10:03.600
I've got something even better!
A great story!

10:03.720 --> 10:04.760
Bye, Bouba!

10:06.560 --> 10:07.480
Thanks again!

10:07.600 --> 10:10.000
Farewell my new friends!

10:11.160 --> 10:12.439
[Ollie] Even though I didn't get

10:12.560 --> 10:14.079
the perfect picture that I wanted

10:14.240 --> 10:15.319
to take,

10:15.480 --> 10:17.760
I had an amazing pink adventure!

10:17.920 --> 10:18.920
And so did my hat!

10:19.079 --> 10:20.400
-Yeah!
-That was amazing!

10:20.560 --> 10:24.079
-Wow!
-What a wonderful picture!

10:24.199 --> 10:26.680
Ollie! They loved your story!

10:26.800 --> 10:29.000
And Auntie Char looks so proud!

10:29.120 --> 10:31.680
I'm so proud of you, Ollie!

10:31.800 --> 10:33.520
And what an adventure!

10:33.680 --> 10:36.439
You climbed up high
and went out on the water,

10:36.600 --> 10:37.959
even though you don't like to!

10:38.120 --> 10:39.760
Yeah, but you know,

10:39.920 --> 10:41.240
there's a saying in Senegal:

10:41.400 --> 10:43.520
the worst day makes the best story.

10:43.640 --> 10:46.800
It certainly does,
my brave little explorer!

10:46.920 --> 10:50.640
Nice job on your first
Explorer's Club meeting, Ollie.

10:50.800 --> 10:52.280
It was great!

10:52.400 --> 10:54.760
Yup. It was perfectly imperfect!

10:54.880 --> 10:55.719
[laughter]

11:00.120 --> 11:01.640
