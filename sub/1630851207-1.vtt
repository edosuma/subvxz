00:59.351 --> 01:01.020
HUGH DOWNS:
Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker

01:01.103 --> 01:04.106
were the most famous
televangelist couple in America,

01:04.273 --> 01:06.192
and, by far, the most prosperous.

01:06.358 --> 01:08.611
AL DALE: Ken and Barbie
of televangelism.

01:08.778 --> 01:10.196
And they seemed honest.

01:10.362 --> 01:12.990
REPORTER 1: They brought encouragement
and hope to lots of people.

01:13.157 --> 01:14.158
GERALDO RIVERA: He's the president

01:14.241 --> 01:15.785
of a multi-million dollar
religious organization

01:15.951 --> 01:17.578
called the Praise The Lord Club.

01:17.745 --> 01:19.872
REPORTER 2: PTL also
operates Heritage Village

01:19.955 --> 01:21.540
in Fort Mill, South Carolina.

01:21.624 --> 01:22.833
REPORTER 3: ...Christian Disney World

01:22.958 --> 01:25.503
where PTL members
can vacation with inspiration.

01:25.669 --> 01:27.296
They are among the best-known figures

01:27.379 --> 01:28.923
in the world of television evangelism.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.133
But tonight they are out of business.

01:31.217 --> 01:32.468
...following the scandal that led

01:32.551 --> 01:34.303
to founder Jim Bakker's
resignation last week.

01:34.470 --> 01:37.014
There's debate about
how much the Bakker scandal will hurt

01:37.181 --> 01:39.350
all the television ministries
and quiet concern...

01:39.517 --> 01:41.352
Modern warfare among the TV preachers.

01:41.560 --> 01:43.521
In this electronic age,
the stakes are high

01:43.604 --> 01:45.022
-with millions of followers...
-...and recriminations.

01:45.105 --> 01:46.106
And caught up in the fighting

01:46.190 --> 01:47.775
are their fellow evangelists
Jimmy Swaggart,

01:47.942 --> 01:49.276
Oral Roberts, Jerry Falwell.

01:49.443 --> 01:50.778
Now, about what some people around here

01:50.861 --> 01:52.112
are calling "pearly-gate."

01:52.279 --> 01:54.949
Pearly-gate is the story
of Jim and Tammy Bakker.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.867
It's remarkably like Watergate,

01:56.951 --> 02:00.246
which tainted the name "politician,"

02:00.412 --> 02:05.501
and such an episode is bound
to taint the name "preacher."

02:05.584 --> 02:07.711
REPORTER 4: The Bakkers
couldn't even get out of their car.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.171
There were so many people
waiting to see them

02:09.255 --> 02:10.256
after three months of seclusion.

02:10.339 --> 02:11.632
REPORTER 5: ...busloads of tourists,

02:11.715 --> 02:13.968
hoping to get a glimpse
of the elusive evangelists,

02:14.134 --> 02:16.637
but they had no better luck
than the waiting newspeople.

02:20.975 --> 02:23.936
WOMAN: Okay, I'm gonna start
by taking some of this off.

02:24.103 --> 02:25.312
TAMMY: Okay.

02:25.479 --> 02:27.147
WOMAN: Gonna take your foundation off.

02:27.231 --> 02:28.232
TAMMY: M'kay.

02:28.440 --> 02:30.401
WOMAN: And then we'll start fresh.

02:31.235 --> 02:32.695
Can you take your lips off?

02:39.535 --> 02:41.120
-Okay.
-Do you want a little remover?

02:41.287 --> 02:44.290
Oh, no. That's it.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.917
That'll be all.
They're permanently lined.

02:47.084 --> 02:48.335
WOMAN: Oh.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.045
And my eyes are permanently lined

02:50.129 --> 02:51.797
and my eyebrows are permanently on,

02:51.964 --> 02:54.675
so there's not a whole lot
you can do.

02:54.758 --> 02:56.010
WOMAN: My goodness,

02:56.093 --> 02:57.553
-I... I didn't know.
-Mm.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.972
Have you never done pictures
without those eyelashes?

03:00.139 --> 03:01.223
Nope, and I never will

03:01.390 --> 03:02.766
because that's my trademark.

03:02.933 --> 03:06.270
And, you know, if I take that away,
then it's not me,

03:06.478 --> 03:08.272
and no one's gonna wanna look
at me without my trademark.

03:08.439 --> 03:09.648
So, I hold onto that.

03:09.815 --> 03:11.275
Even if we softened 'em up and kept...

03:11.442 --> 03:14.111
No. No, you can do anything you want,

03:14.278 --> 03:16.906
but my eyelashes stay
right where they are.

03:17.072 --> 03:18.657
WOMAN: That's really you.

03:18.741 --> 03:19.742
TAMMY: Mm.

03:20.117 --> 03:22.620
Oh, yeah, this is who I am.

03:38.677 --> 03:41.722
PREACHER: I didn't know
what the words "glory" or "hallelujah" be

03:41.889 --> 03:43.682
because the devil is all around us!

03:43.766 --> 03:44.934
-Oh, yes, he is!

03:45.017 --> 03:47.519
And it's up to you to resist
his temptations. Hallelujah!

03:48.729 --> 03:50.356
If you're not saved by Jesus,

03:50.439 --> 03:52.524
you open yourself up to demons

03:52.691 --> 03:55.736
and the devil will make a home in you!

03:56.195 --> 03:57.196
WOMAN: Glory to God!

03:57.279 --> 03:58.781
When God spoke peace to my heart,

03:58.948 --> 04:01.450
I didn't know how to say glory
or hallelujah,

04:01.617 --> 04:03.202
but I got saved!

04:03.369 --> 04:04.954
I leapt upon that altar.

04:05.120 --> 04:07.081
Jesus told me He loved me,

04:07.247 --> 04:09.792
and He will love you.

04:11.001 --> 04:13.837
He speaks through her.
Say, "Hallelujah!"

04:14.004 --> 04:15.589
CONGREGATION: Hallelujah!

04:15.756 --> 04:18.509
PREACHER: She is with
the Holy Spirit right now!

04:18.676 --> 04:20.594
Feel the spirit! Say, "Glory.

04:21.220 --> 04:22.388
"Glory to God."

04:22.554 --> 04:23.722
CONGREGATION: Glory to God!

04:23.889 --> 04:26.475
PREACHER: You too, sister!
Feel the spirit.

04:26.642 --> 04:28.352
Raise your hands up, folks.

04:30.479 --> 04:31.939
LITTLE TAMMY: I was here.

04:32.106 --> 04:33.232
Here the whole time.

04:33.732 --> 04:35.901
Little girls go to Hell for lying.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.820
Honest and true.

04:37.987 --> 04:39.446
I wanna be saved.

04:40.948 --> 04:42.282
If you let me come in with you,

04:42.366 --> 04:44.410
God'd love me like He's supposed to.

04:44.576 --> 04:46.328
There's reasons
you can't be seen in church, Tam.

04:46.495 --> 04:47.830
Grown-up reasons.

04:48.414 --> 04:50.499
Is it because everyone thinks
you're a harlot?

04:52.459 --> 04:53.460
And I come from a time

04:53.544 --> 04:55.170
before Fred made you
respectable and stuff.

04:57.339 --> 04:58.924
Only reason they let me back

04:59.008 --> 05:01.135
is 'cause nobody but me
can play the piano.

05:01.343 --> 05:03.804
But you remind them I was divorced.

05:04.054 --> 05:06.056
They see you,

05:06.223 --> 05:07.933
all of us is going to be banished.

05:09.351 --> 05:11.270
The souls of all your brothers and sisters

05:11.437 --> 05:13.897
burning in Hell because you don't listen

05:13.981 --> 05:15.941
and you can't sit still.

05:22.698 --> 05:24.241
Stop performing.

05:28.245 --> 05:30.247
You're going to Hell, Tammy.

05:30.414 --> 05:33.667
You don't belong here.
You don't belong anywhere.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.294
You're ugly.

05:35.461 --> 05:37.296
You've got a demon inside you.

05:38.464 --> 05:40.466
But I don't wanna go to Hell.

05:41.508 --> 05:42.968
If they loved you,

05:43.052 --> 05:44.720
they wouldn't leave you here.

05:45.721 --> 05:46.847
They love me.

05:47.014 --> 05:49.224
They love you not.

05:52.603 --> 05:55.355
Jesus, come into my heart

05:55.439 --> 05:57.316
and forgive me my sins.

05:58.317 --> 06:01.445
I don't know what this is
everybody's getting,

06:01.612 --> 06:02.780
but if it's real,

06:03.405 --> 06:06.909
then, please, Jesus, give that to me.

06:09.286 --> 06:10.704
-PREACHER: Amen!

06:11.288 --> 06:13.957
Be strong in the Lord
and His mighty power.

06:14.124 --> 06:15.459
Put on the armor of God

06:15.626 --> 06:16.752
so that you can take your stand

06:16.835 --> 06:18.545
against the devil's schemes.

06:18.712 --> 06:21.507
For our struggle isn't
against flesh and blood,

06:21.673 --> 06:24.593
but against the powers
of this dark world!

06:24.760 --> 06:26.470
Casting down imaginations

06:26.637 --> 06:30.140
on every high thing that exalts itself.

06:30.307 --> 06:32.101
-Do you feel love?
-CONGREGATION: Yes.

06:32.309 --> 06:34.228
PREACHER: You feel it, sister!
I know you feel it!

06:35.354 --> 06:36.939
You too, brother?

06:37.231 --> 06:38.649
If you feel the love,

06:38.732 --> 06:40.400
-say, "Hallelujah!"
-CONGREGATION: Hallelujah!

06:40.484 --> 06:42.861
PREACHER: Say, "Glory to God!"
CONGREGATION: Glory to God!

06:43.237 --> 06:44.404
PREACHER: Accept the blood!

06:44.613 --> 06:46.156
Feel love forever!

06:46.323 --> 06:47.407
CONGREGATION: Hallelujah!

06:47.491 --> 06:48.951
WOMAN: Praise the Lord!

06:49.535 --> 06:51.161
Are you ready to accept the love?

06:51.745 --> 06:52.871
Yes.

07:07.761 --> 07:08.929
Tammy Faye!

07:11.181 --> 07:14.351
I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.855
No, Tammy!

07:18.230 --> 07:20.190
Tammy, get up.

07:20.732 --> 07:21.942
He is with us!

07:22.734 --> 07:24.611
She's peeing herself! Praise God!

07:25.154 --> 07:26.155
Yes!

07:26.613 --> 07:28.448
-Tammy, I said get up.
-WOMAN: Shush now.

07:28.824 --> 07:31.702
This baby is a miracle.
Don't you take her from us.

07:37.541 --> 07:38.834
MAN: Mr. Bakker?

07:39.376 --> 07:40.460
JIM: Yes, sir?

07:42.880 --> 07:43.922
Thank you.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.807
Um, sorry.

07:56.226 --> 07:57.519
I would like to start with a verse.

07:58.145 --> 08:03.525
"Beloved, I wish above all things
that thou mayest prosper

08:03.692 --> 08:07.613
"and be in health,
even as thy soul prospereth."

08:07.779 --> 08:09.281
That is John 3, verse 2,

08:09.364 --> 08:12.034
and it's written right here
in the good book.

08:12.201 --> 08:14.244
He gave me this verse last night.

08:14.411 --> 08:17.247
God, He came right down
and He whispered it in my ear.

08:17.414 --> 08:18.999
He said, "Jim Bakker,

08:19.166 --> 08:22.502
"I intend for you to thrive,

08:22.669 --> 08:25.088
"to live, and to love

08:25.255 --> 08:27.090
"in this life."

08:27.257 --> 08:28.258
He said it to me.

08:28.425 --> 08:29.885
But us Christians,

08:30.761 --> 08:33.430
we've been taught
that we're supposed to

08:33.889 --> 08:36.391
expect failure.

08:37.976 --> 08:39.353
-When Jesus calls you home,

08:39.436 --> 08:40.938
you think you're going to get a bonus

08:41.021 --> 08:43.106
if you make yourself miserable?

08:44.274 --> 08:46.318
You think if you deny yourself
indoor plumbing,

08:46.485 --> 08:47.903
or if you don't have shoes

08:47.986 --> 08:49.863
-on your feet...
-

08:51.031 --> 08:52.491
I'm... I'm sorry.

08:55.744 --> 08:56.745
Go ahead.

08:59.790 --> 09:01.333
You know, Heaven,

09:01.416 --> 09:03.335
Heaven is heaven, that is for sure.

09:03.502 --> 09:06.004
But God's hope for us

09:06.171 --> 09:09.967
is that we live and we thrive
and we love here

09:10.133 --> 09:11.260
in the promised land.

09:11.426 --> 09:12.844
Here and now.

09:13.011 --> 09:16.890
Here and now,
and in this very, very moment.

09:16.974 --> 09:18.225
Hallelujah!

09:18.308 --> 09:20.769
God does not want us to be poor!

09:20.978 --> 09:22.104
Oh, no!

09:22.813 --> 09:26.066
He will gift the faithful
with eternal life,

09:26.233 --> 09:29.236
eternal love, and eternal wealth!

09:29.403 --> 09:33.073
Hallelujah! Praise God!
Praise Him!

09:36.034 --> 09:37.369
Be right to remember,

09:37.452 --> 09:39.913
"Blessed be the poor," Mr. Bakker.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.207
Doesn't sound very blessed to me.

09:45.669 --> 09:49.339
You two are here to learn the ways
of the Lord through scripture, yeah?

09:49.423 --> 09:50.424
Yes, sir.

09:50.507 --> 09:51.508
And to spread the word of God.

09:51.591 --> 09:52.592
Oh, yeah. You know,

09:52.676 --> 09:54.845
I'm gonna sing the word in every tent,
in every church.

09:55.012 --> 09:57.848
You know, God told me that
that's what He wants for me.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.560
With makeup on your face?

10:02.811 --> 10:04.813
Ahem. Jezebel.
-

10:10.277 --> 10:12.029
"I do my best to maintain always

10:12.112 --> 10:13.155
"a blameless conscience,

10:13.238 --> 10:15.490
"both before God and before men."

10:17.534 --> 10:19.661
"A man who keeps company with harlots

10:20.912 --> 10:22.289
"wastes his wealth."

10:22.456 --> 10:24.750
Proverbs 29:3.

10:24.916 --> 10:28.587
"Your stature is like that of a palm
and your breasts

10:29.212 --> 10:30.547
"like clusters of fruit.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.674
"I will take hold of the palm tree."

10:32.841 --> 10:36.303
"And I will take hold of the fruit."

10:37.512 --> 10:39.014
That's the Song of Solomon.

10:39.181 --> 10:41.224
7:7.

10:45.020 --> 10:47.814
JIM: I'm sorry I couldn't
drive you someplace nice.

10:48.190 --> 10:50.650
Oh, this is someplace nice, Jim.

10:51.693 --> 10:53.362
Tell me something. Tell me a secret.

10:53.528 --> 10:55.072
Something that no one else knows about.

10:55.238 --> 10:56.239
Oh, I have no secrets.

10:56.323 --> 10:57.532
I'll tell you anything you wanna know.

10:57.699 --> 10:58.867
We'll start with everything.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.412
-Okay.
-

11:02.579 --> 11:03.789
I'm the oldest of eight children

11:03.872 --> 11:05.624
and I'm a very practical person.

11:05.791 --> 11:07.250
And what you see is all there is of me.

11:07.417 --> 11:08.960
You know, I don't pretend
to be something I'm not

11:09.127 --> 11:10.670
because what you see is all you get.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.255
And I love people.

11:12.631 --> 11:15.759
I have a genuine,
genuine love for people.

11:16.009 --> 11:18.178
And I hurt when people hurt,

11:18.345 --> 11:20.555
and probably a little more dramatic
than people would like me to be.

11:20.639 --> 11:23.475
But I enjoy that.
That's just who I am.

11:24.643 --> 11:27.104
I've never met anyone quite like you,
Tammy Faye.

11:29.940 --> 11:31.108
Okay.

11:31.274 --> 11:34.569
So, um, do you have any secrets, Jim?

11:35.529 --> 11:38.198
Well, one or two.

11:39.074 --> 11:40.826
Well, tell me.

11:40.992 --> 11:45.122
Well, before God found me,
I wanted to be a radio deejay.

11:46.665 --> 11:47.833
-No.
-Yes.

11:48.708 --> 11:52.087
I used to love to make people dance.

11:52.254 --> 11:53.422
Have fun.

11:54.172 --> 11:56.299
-Little Richard.
-

11:56.466 --> 11:58.009
And Buddy Holly and...

11:58.677 --> 12:00.137
Oh, and Fats Domino.

12:02.180 --> 12:04.099
What happened?
Why didn't you do it, Jim?

12:04.182 --> 12:05.225
Ah.

12:06.017 --> 12:07.644
Never mind that.

12:07.811 --> 12:08.812
Tell me.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.107
Um, I don't think...

12:14.693 --> 12:17.446
Well, all right.
I'll tell you, Tammy. Um...

12:18.029 --> 12:20.073
Two years ago,
I was on a date

12:20.157 --> 12:21.533
with my girlfriend, Sandy, and...

12:21.616 --> 12:22.784
Mm.
-Oh, no,

12:22.868 --> 12:24.327
with my girlfriend at the time.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.204
-Mm.
-But, anyhoo,

12:26.288 --> 12:27.664
I borrowed my daddy's car
to take her out,

12:27.747 --> 12:31.251
and there was all this snow
on the ground

12:31.877 --> 12:36.298
and Fats was singing Blueberry Hill

12:36.465 --> 12:37.757
so loud

12:39.426 --> 12:41.219
and I... I was having these urges

12:41.303 --> 12:43.472
that only the devil would approve of

12:43.638 --> 12:46.349
and I lost control of the car.

12:49.728 --> 12:51.813
And I ran over a little boy,

12:52.397 --> 12:53.899
-little Jimmy Summerfield.
-

12:54.983 --> 12:57.068
I ruptured Jimmy Summerfield's lung...

12:57.152 --> 12:59.529
-...with my daddy's tire.

12:59.696 --> 13:00.906
I didn't sleep all night.

13:01.072 --> 13:03.742
I was just up worried sick
about that boy dying.

13:03.825 --> 13:04.826
So, I...

13:05.452 --> 13:07.078
I made a bargain with God.

13:07.412 --> 13:08.872
I said to Him,

13:09.039 --> 13:11.208
"I will forsake my dream
of being a deejay.

13:11.374 --> 13:15.962
"I will stop peddling in rock and roll

13:16.129 --> 13:20.342
"and I'll dedicate my life
to Him and Him alone.

13:20.509 --> 13:23.261
"If He sees fit to save that boy's life,

13:23.428 --> 13:26.848
"He will win two souls
right then and there."

13:28.892 --> 13:30.727
And what happened to Jimmy Summerfield?

13:31.728 --> 13:32.812
He lived.

13:32.896 --> 13:34.189
-Oh.
-Yes.

13:34.356 --> 13:36.316
-Praise be to God.
-Yes, praise Him.

13:39.110 --> 13:40.278
So...

13:42.113 --> 13:43.740
You still like me?

13:44.199 --> 13:46.785
Oh, sure, I do, Jim.

13:47.160 --> 13:50.413
Oh, even more now that
you were honest with me.

13:52.749 --> 13:54.000
I'll tell ya, I do miss dancing.

13:56.920 --> 13:59.923
I found my thrill

14:01.466 --> 14:05.095
On Blueberry Hill

14:06.263 --> 14:09.391
I found my thrill

14:11.059 --> 14:14.062
When I found you

14:14.229 --> 14:15.480
You're so loud.

14:16.231 --> 14:17.357
Dance with me, Jim.

14:18.066 --> 14:19.276
Here? No, I can't.

14:19.442 --> 14:21.778
In front of all these people?
Like, no...

14:21.945 --> 14:23.071
Please?

14:26.825 --> 14:30.328
The moon stood still

14:30.495 --> 14:34.249
On Blueberry Hill

14:34.499 --> 14:38.253
-And lingered until
-

14:39.212 --> 14:42.924
My dreams came true

14:51.349 --> 14:53.018
Oh, we can't.

14:53.226 --> 14:54.436
I know.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.985
-We can't.
-I know.

15:05.822 --> 15:09.117
Oh. Oh, we can't.

15:11.161 --> 15:12.162
I know.

15:16.458 --> 15:17.500
Yeah!

15:19.544 --> 15:20.754
What'd you do?

15:21.046 --> 15:23.506
Hello, Mother.
This is Jim Bakker,

15:27.677 --> 15:32.098
Oh, it's such a blessing
to finally meet you.

15:39.314 --> 15:40.315
TAMMY: No.

15:40.482 --> 15:41.858
No, Mother, we can't go back to school.

15:42.025 --> 15:44.319
They have a rule against
students marrying one another.

15:44.486 --> 15:46.196
Did you know they had that rule
when you did this?

15:46.363 --> 15:49.282
If I know the two of you,
you're just gonna love Jim.

15:49.449 --> 15:50.617
Oh, he's so motivated.

15:50.784 --> 15:52.410
He has so many big ideas.

15:52.577 --> 15:53.995
Did you know?

16:05.215 --> 16:08.385
Well, you can educate yourself
right out of a relationship with God.

16:08.551 --> 16:10.011
He has a plan for us.

16:10.470 --> 16:13.014
-God or that Jim boy?
-God.

16:13.848 --> 16:15.475
What'd He tell ya to do this time?

16:15.642 --> 16:19.270
Come spring, me and Jim
are going to be traveling preachers,

16:19.437 --> 16:20.897
bringing God's love to all people.

16:21.064 --> 16:23.858
Anyone who's hurting
or they feel like they've been left out.

16:24.025 --> 16:25.777
Jim will preach and I'll sing.

16:25.944 --> 16:28.530
And we'll be like
Oral Roberts and his wife.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.282
Oral Roberts went to college.

16:31.574 --> 16:34.452
-He has one named for him.

16:34.619 --> 16:36.538
God said that we're supposed
to have a good life.

16:36.705 --> 16:38.998
That way, we can help
bring his love to all people.

16:39.165 --> 16:41.751
There's a limit to God's love,
Tammy Faye.

16:42.752 --> 16:43.753
TAMMY AND JIM: No.

16:44.045 --> 16:48.091
No, there's no limit to God's love,
Mrs. Grover,

16:48.299 --> 16:50.802
and there's no limit
to Tammy Faye and I either.

16:51.428 --> 16:52.887
We're soldiers in Christ.

16:53.054 --> 16:55.724
We've been called to serve
in a very real way.

16:55.890 --> 16:57.809
God smiles on a husband and wife.

16:57.976 --> 17:00.311
"As a young man marries a young woman,

17:00.478 --> 17:02.897
"so will your Builder marry you;

17:03.064 --> 17:06.651
"as a bridegroom rejoices in his bride,

17:06.818 --> 17:09.738
"so will your God rejoice in you."

17:09.904 --> 17:11.614
Isaiah 62:5.

17:14.576 --> 17:16.286
JIM: It's something we do.

17:28.715 --> 17:31.384
Fred said that we could stay
until the weather changes.

17:33.011 --> 17:34.262
Got some bubbles at the swap meet.

17:39.309 --> 17:41.186
I'm sorry, Tam.

17:43.021 --> 17:45.064
I feel like I'm letting you down.

17:46.232 --> 17:48.777
She doesn't like me.

17:49.110 --> 17:51.696
-No, Jim.
-No, she doesn't.

17:52.864 --> 17:55.033
Of course she likes you.

17:58.369 --> 17:59.496
TAMMY: Oh.

18:04.167 --> 18:07.629
It makes Tammy sad
to see you so sad.

18:09.172 --> 18:10.548
How's there supposed to be bubbles

18:10.632 --> 18:13.092
if there isn't enough water
to work up the bubbles?

18:13.259 --> 18:15.970
Oh, I can work up the bubbles, Jim.

18:16.304 --> 18:19.432
All I gotta do is dunk my hand.

18:21.643 --> 18:24.145
And I swirl...

18:29.526 --> 18:31.486
-And swirl.
-

18:32.654 --> 18:34.656
-

18:37.325 --> 18:38.701
-Am I doing that all right?

18:38.868 --> 18:40.370
Uh-huh.

18:53.174 --> 18:55.593
Well, hello there, Tammy Faye.

18:57.303 --> 18:58.888
Hello, Mommy.

18:59.055 --> 19:00.890
What are you doing with those things?

19:01.057 --> 19:03.059
Well, we're gonna use these
puppets as part of our sermon

19:03.226 --> 19:04.894
and show the kids how wonderful God is.

19:05.061 --> 19:06.563
And if we can get enough children to come,

19:06.729 --> 19:08.064
they'll bring their mothers
and their fathers.

19:08.147 --> 19:10.275
And before you know it,
we'll have our own church.

19:14.904 --> 19:17.740
Have you counted
your blessings today, Tammy Faye?

19:17.907 --> 19:19.826
No, not yet, Susie.

19:20.159 --> 19:23.204
Time to count your blessings,
for they are plentiful.

19:23.788 --> 19:27.166
Okay, well, thank you for my husband.

19:27.333 --> 19:30.753
Oh, you're so welcome, Tammy.

19:31.504 --> 19:35.008
And thank you for Mother's understanding,
even if she doesn't understand.

19:35.675 --> 19:38.136
You're welcome.

19:39.929 --> 19:42.348
And thank you, God, for love.

19:59.616 --> 20:00.617
Hmm.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.660
-

20:03.036 --> 20:05.455
-

20:07.248 --> 20:10.209
Jim! Whose car is this?

20:11.669 --> 20:12.962
No.

20:13.296 --> 20:16.174
-Get in. Get in. Come on.

20:16.341 --> 20:17.425
TAMMY: Okay.

20:18.343 --> 20:20.345
Roll that window up.
I got the heat on.

20:21.554 --> 20:22.972
This fine vehicle

20:23.056 --> 20:25.892
with the leather interior
and the chrome on the wheels

20:26.059 --> 20:29.771
is a gift from God
for us to do His work.

20:33.024 --> 20:35.526
But how
can we afford it, Jim Bakker?

20:36.861 --> 20:38.488
Who is this?

20:38.655 --> 20:40.031
I'm Susie Moppet.

20:40.198 --> 20:43.493
Aren't you cute? Well, do
you know about God, Susie?

20:43.701 --> 20:44.702
Oh, I do.

20:44.786 --> 20:48.081
Well, God has cancelled
the claim of poverty

20:48.164 --> 20:49.832
and deprivation in our lives

20:49.999 --> 20:52.669
and He has placed
all the powers of heaven

20:52.835 --> 20:55.088
and the First Bank
of International Falls,

20:55.171 --> 20:57.548
Minnesota, at our disposal.

21:03.638 --> 21:06.933
Oh, this is the nicest car
I've ever seen, Jim.

21:07.141 --> 21:10.103
"Everything works for good
for them that love God."

21:10.186 --> 21:11.729
Everything.

21:12.230 --> 21:15.149
But you have
to have faith in Him

21:15.316 --> 21:18.236
and in me and in us,
'cause if you don't,

21:18.403 --> 21:20.029
I don't know
what I'm doing here.

21:20.196 --> 21:22.198
-Oh, I do, Jim.
-You do?

21:24.367 --> 21:25.660
Does she, Susie?

21:26.869 --> 21:28.371
Oh, she do, Jim!

21:28.538 --> 21:31.207
-She really, really do!
-

21:41.259 --> 21:43.011
JIM: You sure...

21:43.177 --> 21:45.763
It's all right here.
In Psalm 37:4.

21:45.847 --> 21:47.890
"Take delight in the Lord

21:48.057 --> 21:51.978
"and He will give you
your heart's desires."

21:52.145 --> 21:55.648
God starts turning
those wheels in your life!

21:55.815 --> 21:56.983
SUSIE: You better believe it!

21:57.150 --> 21:59.652
-JIM: Oh, now who is this?
-Oh, I'm Susie Moppet.

21:59.861 --> 22:01.362
Well, hello there, Susie Moppet.

22:01.529 --> 22:02.947
SUSIE: Hi! Nice to meet you!

22:04.490 --> 22:06.743
-She jumped up.
-

22:07.744 --> 22:09.537
Yes, Jesus loves me

22:09.704 --> 22:11.289
Yes, Jesus loves me

22:11.456 --> 22:12.915
Yes, Jesus loves me

22:13.082 --> 22:16.794
BOTH: The Bible tells me so

22:16.961 --> 22:19.297
Hitch up your wagon to God.

22:19.505 --> 22:21.257
He's greater than any problem.

22:21.424 --> 22:22.759
Us Christians, we're just
stuck in the mud

22:22.925 --> 22:24.761
like that old game.
Remember that old kids' game?

22:24.927 --> 22:27.096
God wants us just to run free.

22:31.476 --> 22:33.352
Well, this is a fun song,
boys and girls.

22:33.519 --> 22:34.687
So, hit it, Allie.

22:35.146 --> 22:36.314
Jesus loves me

22:36.397 --> 22:39.108
This I know
For the Bible tells me so

22:39.400 --> 22:41.360
Yes, Jesus loves me

22:41.527 --> 22:44.030
-ALLIE: The Bible tells me so
-

22:47.283 --> 22:49.118
ANNOUNCER:
You're watching Pat Robertson

22:49.202 --> 22:50.828
on the Christian
Broadcasting Network.

22:50.995 --> 22:51.996
JIM: Come on.

22:52.080 --> 22:54.165
Season all your grain offerings...

22:54.332 --> 22:55.750
Oh, come on!

22:55.833 --> 22:58.044
-Okay, okay, okay.
-...with salt.

22:58.211 --> 23:01.172
Do not leave the salt
of the covenant of your God

23:01.255 --> 23:03.132
out of your grain offerings.

23:03.216 --> 23:04.509
Add salt

23:05.218 --> 23:06.469
to all your offerings.

23:06.552 --> 23:09.972
You know, he's not terribly
dynamic for a charismatic.

23:10.139 --> 23:11.641
JIM: I know, but people just eat him up.

23:11.849 --> 23:14.227
...focus on the foundation.

23:14.435 --> 23:15.895
-Tammy, did you see that?
-Hmm?

23:15.978 --> 23:18.272
Watch close.
Every now and again,

23:18.439 --> 23:20.358
he glances up at the camera.

23:20.525 --> 23:23.486
It is upon Him that you
can place your strong...

23:23.653 --> 23:25.113
-See that?
- You're right.

23:25.196 --> 23:28.783
He's talking right to you
in the comfort of your living room.

23:28.950 --> 23:31.035
Well, if I could have watched a preacher

23:31.202 --> 23:34.288
on TV in my own home telling me about God,

23:34.455 --> 23:36.332
that would've made such a difference.

23:36.415 --> 23:38.334
JIM: Mm. Amen.

23:38.918 --> 23:42.630
Especially from someone
who preaches as good as you do, Jim.

23:43.339 --> 23:45.508
-

23:45.591 --> 23:47.218
-You think?
-Oh, yeah.

23:47.385 --> 23:49.428
...blow your home over?

23:50.012 --> 23:51.430
You know, we could do that.

23:53.099 --> 23:56.435
You're so much more handsome than he is.

23:57.687 --> 23:58.729
Keep calling.

23:58.938 --> 24:00.148
JIM: Gotta do my homework, baby.

24:00.231 --> 24:01.315
The numbers are on your screen.

24:01.399 --> 24:02.733
Mm. Stop it.

24:02.900 --> 24:04.694
You're distracting me.

24:04.861 --> 24:07.363
...voices of angels.
I hope you enjoy them,

24:07.446 --> 24:08.656
and we have a variety...

24:09.448 --> 24:12.451
Well, we'll have to call the preacher
down in Raleigh

24:12.618 --> 24:14.328
and let him know we got
a better gig down here.

24:14.495 --> 24:16.247
Don't make him cross at you, Jim.

24:16.414 --> 24:18.082
We wanna have him want us back.

24:18.249 --> 24:19.625
JIM: Hold on.

24:19.792 --> 24:21.085
TAMMY: What?

24:21.252 --> 24:22.336
JIM: The car.

24:23.546 --> 24:24.672
I...

24:26.340 --> 24:27.967
I... I parked it here.

24:28.259 --> 24:30.803
Yep, you sure did. Uh-huh.

24:32.263 --> 24:33.389
Well, must've got stolen...

24:33.556 --> 24:34.640
What?

24:34.724 --> 24:36.893
Oh.

24:37.977 --> 24:39.061
Oh, maybe it got towed.

24:39.687 --> 24:42.565
No, I know I made the payments, so...

24:43.983 --> 24:45.526
I think I made the payments.

24:45.693 --> 24:46.694
Oh, Jim.

24:46.777 --> 24:48.362
Maybe they didn't get
the payments or maybe...

24:48.446 --> 24:49.447
Oh, no.

24:49.530 --> 24:50.823
I don't think I forgot.

24:51.199 --> 24:52.533
-I think I...
-Okay.

24:52.617 --> 24:54.952
-Oh, Tammy, I don't know...
-We need to pray.

24:55.119 --> 24:57.163
Oh, did I? Yes, yes, yes.

24:57.246 --> 24:58.414
TAMMY: Oh, Lord,

24:58.581 --> 25:00.374
we are good soldiers.

25:00.541 --> 25:02.168
-We are here for good.
-Oh, I'm sorry, Tammy.

25:02.251 --> 25:03.920
-We are here for your good.
-I'm so, so, so sorry.

25:04.003 --> 25:05.213
And we ask that you shine your light...

25:05.296 --> 25:06.797
JIM: I shouldn't have put
so much faith in that bank.

25:06.881 --> 25:08.341
God, I'm so sorry.

25:08.549 --> 25:09.675
Jesus, I'm so sorry.

25:09.842 --> 25:11.302
Tammy, I'm sorry.

25:11.469 --> 25:12.929
I'm sorry.

25:13.095 --> 25:14.597
-Jim.
-

25:16.849 --> 25:17.850
MAN: Hey.

25:18.392 --> 25:20.728
Hey, I saw you preach last night.

25:20.895 --> 25:23.814
Those puppets of yours filled me. Deeply.

25:23.981 --> 25:25.274
TAMMY: Oh, thank you.

25:25.358 --> 25:26.400
JIM: Thank you.

25:26.567 --> 25:28.027
I'm staying in the room next door.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.696
-Can I help you with that?
- No!

25:30.780 --> 25:32.490
Well, that's very kind of you...

25:33.658 --> 25:36.077
...but we don't rightly know
where we're carrying it to.

25:36.911 --> 25:38.537
I work at a local television station

25:38.704 --> 25:40.873
with a minister by the name
of Mr. Pat Robertson.

25:44.961 --> 25:46.379
He'd get a kick outta you two.

25:51.467 --> 25:54.929
WOMAN 1: Yes, honey,
and that's $25 a pledge.

25:55.012 --> 25:58.391
-WOMAN 2: CBN.

25:58.474 --> 26:00.393
Can I take your pledge?

26:01.811 --> 26:03.729
JIM: Well, I'm trying to focus.

26:05.481 --> 26:07.400
And you're just distracting me.

26:07.566 --> 26:09.860
You make me laugh.
I was happy to find...

26:12.738 --> 26:14.699
JIM: You're so funny, Graham.

26:14.865 --> 26:16.325
-Jim?
-Hey, honey.

26:16.409 --> 26:18.119
Hi, I got a new outfit for the show.

26:18.286 --> 26:20.079
Oh, yes, I love it.

26:20.579 --> 26:22.331
Jim.
-JIM: Yeah?

26:22.498 --> 26:23.499
You didn't even look at me.

26:23.666 --> 26:24.667
JIM: Oh.

26:25.293 --> 26:26.711
I'm sorry, Tam.

26:26.877 --> 26:28.045
Have I ever told you

26:28.129 --> 26:31.799
that I am the luckiest man
on the face of this planet?

26:31.882 --> 26:33.634
-Have I ever told you that?

26:33.718 --> 26:35.678
-Not today.
-Not today, no?

26:35.845 --> 26:37.054
I'm going to tell you something, too,

26:37.138 --> 26:38.723
but I'm not gonna tell you right now.

26:38.889 --> 26:39.890
You're gonna have to wait.

26:40.099 --> 26:41.934
-Yeah.

26:42.685 --> 26:43.936
You just have to.

26:44.353 --> 26:45.688
And there he is.

26:46.188 --> 26:47.273
Every time I try and talk to him,

26:47.356 --> 26:49.400
he just keeps making excuses
not to see me.

26:49.567 --> 26:53.321
Well, my surprise is gonna
make you feel so much better.

26:53.904 --> 26:55.156
I'll be right back.

26:55.323 --> 26:56.365
No, Jim,

26:56.532 --> 26:57.825
-the show's about to start.
-JIM: Hey, Pat!

26:57.908 --> 26:59.952
PAT: Jim! Hey!
JIM: You got a second?

27:01.162 --> 27:03.289
Have you given more thought
to our show idea?

27:03.372 --> 27:04.373
MAN: All right,
let me get you set up.

27:04.457 --> 27:05.791
PAT: Don't you already
have your hands full

27:05.875 --> 27:07.084
with those puppets?

27:07.251 --> 27:09.503
Biggest earner we got.
You stay focused.

27:09.670 --> 27:10.755
JIM: Well, yes, of course,

27:10.880 --> 27:13.424
but you shut down CBN at 10 p.m.

27:13.632 --> 27:15.009
Why not do a late-night show?

27:15.176 --> 27:16.969
Just kind of like Johnny Carson
for Christians?

27:17.053 --> 27:19.263
No, Christians don't stay up that late.

27:19.347 --> 27:20.348
Oh, I do.

27:20.431 --> 27:22.016
-I don't sleep at all.
-PAT: What about Tam?

27:22.183 --> 27:23.976
Well, she's gonna miss you at night.

27:24.143 --> 27:26.062
JIM: Tammy loves the idea.
MAN: Tammy, we're on.

27:26.228 --> 27:29.231
MAN 2: Okay, we're live
in five, four, three.

27:33.361 --> 27:34.820
Oh, hello, everybody!

27:34.987 --> 27:37.615
CHILDREN: Hi, Tammy!

27:37.782 --> 27:40.159
Well, Jim is a little bit late today,

27:40.326 --> 27:42.995
so, um, the theme of today's show,

27:43.162 --> 27:44.872
how about we make it
all about the importance

27:44.955 --> 27:47.249
of being places on time, hmm?

27:47.333 --> 27:49.335
Oh, no! Oh, no!
-

27:49.418 --> 27:51.212
-I'm sorry, kids!
-There he is.

27:51.379 --> 27:54.548
I'm sorry, Tammy!
I'm sorry, everybody.

27:54.757 --> 27:57.051
I was just having a little,
fun little chat

27:57.218 --> 27:59.804
with Uncle Pat just behind the barn.

27:59.970 --> 28:02.014
Oh, yeah, and what'd you two
fellas get up to without me?

28:02.181 --> 28:05.101
Oh, well, it's actually
something all you kids...

28:05.184 --> 28:06.185
-Mm-hmm.
-...are gonna wanna

28:06.268 --> 28:07.686
tell your parents about.

28:07.853 --> 28:12.191
It's a brand-new show just for them

28:12.358 --> 28:15.820
right here on CBN!

28:15.903 --> 28:17.363
-Well, amen!

28:17.446 --> 28:20.408
JIM: And it's gonna be called
The 700 Club.

28:20.574 --> 28:22.159
TAMMY: Now, isn't that happy news?

28:22.326 --> 28:25.121
Hallelujah! Yes! Yes!

28:25.287 --> 28:26.288
-SUSIE: Hi, kids.
-Oh.

28:26.705 --> 28:29.917
-ALL: Hi, Susie Moppet.

28:30.084 --> 28:32.711
Hi, Jim.
Today's a happy day.

28:32.878 --> 28:34.380
Isn't it, kids?
And you know why, Jim?

28:34.588 --> 28:36.173
Why, Susie?

28:36.340 --> 28:39.343
Well, you're gonna have
a new show, kids.

28:39.427 --> 28:41.053
-JIM: Yes.
-

28:41.220 --> 28:44.682
SUSIE: And Jim is gonna have

28:44.849 --> 28:46.392
a baby.

28:46.475 --> 28:47.685
-

28:47.768 --> 28:49.645
Look at Tammy,
she's right behind you.

28:53.190 --> 28:54.859
We're gonna have a baby?

28:55.693 --> 28:58.195
Isn't the world just
full of blessings, Jim?

28:58.279 --> 29:00.239
-Huh?

29:00.322 --> 29:02.116
-That's right, folks!

29:05.453 --> 29:07.329
We're gonna have a baby!

29:07.413 --> 29:08.747
-Oh-ho-ho!

29:08.873 --> 29:11.834
JIM: It's not a drag to be saved.

29:12.001 --> 29:13.752
It's not a boring thing.

29:13.919 --> 29:16.672
That's religion.
See, you got 'em mixed up.

29:16.839 --> 29:19.175
Religion is boring and dull,

29:19.341 --> 29:22.511
-but Jesus is life.
-

29:22.678 --> 29:25.222
Now, my next guest is
a new friend to The 700 Club,

29:25.389 --> 29:29.351
and I can smell his chicken,
yes.

29:29.560 --> 29:34.064
The Colonel, Colonel Sanders
in The 700 Club!

29:34.148 --> 29:36.567
-

29:41.280 --> 29:45.409
Oh, the crowd appreciates you.
I think they like you.

29:45.576 --> 29:47.286
I think they're wanting
some of that chicken.

29:47.453 --> 29:48.746
JIM: I guess
the housewives of America

29:48.829 --> 29:50.122
are thanking you for fixing dinner...

29:53.417 --> 29:54.418
Hello.

29:54.585 --> 29:56.003
TAMMY: Oh, hi, Mom.

29:56.170 --> 29:59.340
Do you know what time it is?
Why are you calling so late?

29:59.548 --> 30:02.259
Well, Jim says that I need
to rest for my pregnancy,

30:02.426 --> 30:05.804
but, oh, you know me. I can't rest,

30:05.971 --> 30:08.057
so thought I'd call my mother
to keep me company.

30:08.224 --> 30:10.017
I never got a rest.

30:10.184 --> 30:12.269
Oh, I miss working, though.
You know?

30:12.436 --> 30:15.189
It's so lonesome at home all by myself.

30:15.356 --> 30:17.775
Wow! Oh, wow!

30:17.942 --> 30:19.276
And he barely touches me anymore.

30:19.360 --> 30:21.779
And when he does, it's not enthusiastic.

30:23.239 --> 30:26.700
Well, it's up to the wife
to make herself desirable for her husband.

30:26.867 --> 30:29.328
I do that. Oh, I do.

30:29.828 --> 30:31.872
He's just really busy.

30:32.039 --> 30:33.582
-JIM: Really?
-

30:33.749 --> 30:35.834
So, are you watching Jim's show?

30:36.001 --> 30:38.087
That new talk show of his is on.

30:38.254 --> 30:39.630
Serving God don't feel like

30:39.713 --> 30:41.549
it should be
a money-making opportunity.

30:41.715 --> 30:42.716
TAMMY: Yeah.

30:43.509 --> 30:45.594
You know,
I wanna do what he's doing.

30:46.011 --> 30:48.597
And I wanna sing
and not in a puppet voice.

30:48.764 --> 30:51.308
And I wanna talk about issues
that affect people's daily lives.

30:51.475 --> 30:52.977
And there's so much
that we don't talk about.

30:53.143 --> 30:54.186
There's so many secrets,

30:54.353 --> 30:57.523
and, you know, everyone says
I'm supposed to be tired,

30:58.148 --> 31:00.109
but I just wanna love people.

31:00.276 --> 31:01.694
You got me out of bed

31:01.777 --> 31:03.404
to talk to me about how you're not tired.

31:03.571 --> 31:05.406
Does that make sense to you?

31:07.491 --> 31:08.492
No.

31:09.535 --> 31:12.705
-Sorry.
-Night night, Tam. Take care.

31:12.871 --> 31:14.790
TAMMY: Good night, Mom.
I love you.

31:14.957 --> 31:15.958
Bye.

31:16.125 --> 31:17.459
Okay, bye-bye.

31:20.629 --> 31:21.630
FRED: Who was it?

31:24.550 --> 31:25.634
RACHEL: That was Tam.

31:25.718 --> 31:26.719
FRED: How is she?

31:26.802 --> 31:28.721
RACHEL: Well, it seems like
she's having some trouble

31:28.804 --> 31:30.306
with the pregnancy.
What'd I miss?

31:30.389 --> 31:31.473
JIM: ...a second childhood.

31:31.557 --> 31:32.808
FRED: I don't know.
The sound was off.

31:32.975 --> 31:34.393
You love kids, don't you?

31:34.476 --> 31:36.103
-You love children.
-COLONEL SANDERS: I do.

31:36.186 --> 31:39.607
I have five grandchildren
and 14 great-grandchildren.

31:39.773 --> 31:41.775
-Wow!
-

31:42.776 --> 31:44.695
I bet they're spoiled.
Do you spoil them?

31:52.953 --> 31:54.955
Oh, dear Lord God.

31:57.583 --> 32:01.170
What doors are you gonna
open up for me to walk through?

32:04.423 --> 32:06.550
What can I do for happiness?

32:09.637 --> 32:11.764
Oh, I wanna get back on TV.

32:14.099 --> 32:16.477
I'm going back to work for you.

32:29.365 --> 32:31.367
-

32:36.622 --> 32:37.998
Well...

32:39.375 --> 32:41.126
What do you think he pays himself?

32:44.922 --> 32:46.090
I should have worn the other dress.

32:46.256 --> 32:47.841
JIM: You look fine, honey.

32:49.218 --> 32:50.386
Oh.

32:50.469 --> 32:51.470
JIM: There he is.

32:51.637 --> 32:53.806
TAMMY: Dede's wearing a mink.
That's a real mink!

32:53.972 --> 32:55.099
And it's warm outside.

32:55.265 --> 32:57.726
You know, we...
we paid for all this, Tammy.

32:57.810 --> 33:01.021
You and me,
from the swimming pool to the hot tub,

33:01.689 --> 33:03.774
and Dede's dead animal.
We paid for it.

33:03.941 --> 33:06.819
Well, the fruit isn't dropping our way,
that's for sure.

33:06.902 --> 33:09.655
-My little stars!

33:10.239 --> 33:11.699
Hello. Hey, Pat!

33:11.782 --> 33:12.950
-What a beautiful place!
-How are you?

33:13.033 --> 33:14.952
-Oh, thank you, thank you!
-Paradise!

33:15.160 --> 33:18.122
Look at that little baby, too.
Positively a chipmunk.

33:18.288 --> 33:19.415
Thanks.

33:19.581 --> 33:20.666
Hey, that's a nice coat.

33:20.833 --> 33:21.875
Oh, thank you, dear.

33:21.959 --> 33:23.127
Must be hot though.

33:23.210 --> 33:24.378
No, not in the least.

33:26.213 --> 33:27.589
PAT: Hey, Jim, I've been thinking.

33:27.673 --> 33:29.591
-JIM: Mm-hmm?
-Have you given any thought

33:29.675 --> 33:32.219
to taking some time off
to be with your family?

33:33.053 --> 33:34.680
These times do not come back.

33:34.763 --> 33:35.764
-No.
-Trust me,

33:35.848 --> 33:37.182
they are precious, precious times.

33:37.266 --> 33:38.267
PAT: No, sir.
JIM: Mm.

33:38.684 --> 33:41.854
I can do The 700 Club for a time.

33:42.521 --> 33:45.983
We can air reruns of
Jim and Tammy for a few weeks.

33:46.400 --> 33:48.527
-TAMMY: Hmm.
-A couple of months even.

33:51.947 --> 33:54.408
It's very...
It's very kind of you, Uncle Pat.

33:54.575 --> 33:55.701
Thank you.

33:55.868 --> 33:59.705
But, you know, I got that bond going
with my audience, you know?

33:59.788 --> 34:00.831
We're on the up-and-up.

34:00.914 --> 34:02.958
I couldn't think
of abandoning them right now.

34:03.125 --> 34:05.127
-Well, we'll think about it.
-Oh, Pat, Pat, Pat!

34:05.294 --> 34:06.670
-PAT: Oh.
-He came.

34:06.754 --> 34:08.922
Oh, my goodness!

34:14.178 --> 34:15.345
-PAT: Hello! Hello!
-Honey.

34:15.429 --> 34:16.722
-I see, I see him.
-Go say hi!

34:16.805 --> 34:18.140
I know, I see him.
We'll sit down, we'll sit down.

34:18.223 --> 34:19.224
PAT: Was your drive in okay?

34:19.308 --> 34:20.768
-Jim, go say hi!
-I don't wanna say hi.

34:20.851 --> 34:22.060
I'm fine. We'll say hi later.

34:22.144 --> 34:24.021
PAT: You remember Jim and Tammy Faye?

34:24.188 --> 34:26.356
-Hey, now, the puppet people!
-

34:26.440 --> 34:28.567
Oh, my goodness, just...

34:28.734 --> 34:30.360
What a pleasure, Mr. Falwell.

34:30.527 --> 34:32.112
A pleasure and a blessing.

34:32.279 --> 34:35.574
You are truly an inspiration to me.
It's an honor.

34:35.741 --> 34:37.201
Nice to meet you, Jerry.
I'm Tammy.

34:37.367 --> 34:39.077
JIM: Tammy Faye and this is Sissy.

34:39.161 --> 34:40.454
-Aren't the three of you

34:40.537 --> 34:41.538
as cute as a button?

34:41.622 --> 34:43.123
TAMMY: Aw!
PAT: Yes, sir!

34:43.749 --> 34:45.083
JERRY: It's a moral issue...

34:47.795 --> 34:49.671
...feminist revolution.

34:55.093 --> 34:56.470
DEDE: You know it was fate.

34:56.637 --> 34:59.139
It was when my youngest
was being baptized,

34:59.306 --> 35:00.974
she was such a little-bitty thing

35:01.141 --> 35:02.810
that we had to put a little milk crate

35:02.893 --> 35:05.270
in the baptismal for her to stand on.

35:06.230 --> 35:08.857
Come on, let's go see Daddy.

35:13.445 --> 35:14.822
Hi!

35:17.783 --> 35:19.284
I have the baby, you know.

35:19.368 --> 35:21.078
It's kinda hard to eat and, you know...

35:21.203 --> 35:22.704
JIM: Sure. Um, yeah.

35:22.871 --> 35:25.582
Using the fork and the knife
at the same time

35:25.749 --> 35:27.084
and, you know, get the food to my mouth.

35:27.167 --> 35:28.293
Well, why don't...

35:28.377 --> 35:29.461
-I think...
-And I wanna hear

35:29.545 --> 35:30.921
all this interesting stuff.

35:31.004 --> 35:32.047
-PAT: Yeah, but...
-Honey...

35:32.130 --> 35:33.131
TAMMY: Well, I'll be right back.

35:33.298 --> 35:34.341
-Tam.
-Oh.

35:36.343 --> 35:37.761
She's a firecracker, Jim.

35:43.350 --> 35:44.560
-Jim.
-Yes.

35:44.726 --> 35:45.769
Come on.

35:45.853 --> 35:47.437
-SWAGGART: Okay.
-

35:49.273 --> 35:50.691
SWAGGART: Okay.

35:51.400 --> 35:52.442
Well, very nice.

35:52.943 --> 35:54.444
As you were saying, Jerry?

35:56.530 --> 35:58.740
Let's call me Reverend Falwell.

35:59.616 --> 36:00.617
Of course.

36:02.286 --> 36:04.454
JERRY: Young people today
are raised on television.

36:04.621 --> 36:06.540
It's taught them an immorality.

36:06.707 --> 36:11.420
But now, we are on television.

36:12.838 --> 36:14.673
When I created The 700 Club,

36:15.090 --> 36:18.051
all I needed was 700 people
to keep us going.

36:18.135 --> 36:21.847
A year later,
we're in six markets and growin'.

36:22.014 --> 36:26.393
Hundreds of thousands of folks
are hearin' the word.

36:26.560 --> 36:28.562
Now, God has a voice in this fight.

36:28.729 --> 36:29.897
SWAGGART: Amen.
PAT: Mm-hmm.

36:29.980 --> 36:31.940
Mm. Who's He fighting?

36:32.733 --> 36:34.192
JERRY: The liberal agenda.

36:34.359 --> 36:36.612
The feminist agenda.

36:36.778 --> 36:37.988
Homosexual agenda.

36:38.447 --> 36:41.241
It's time for a reversal of these trends.

36:41.450 --> 36:44.286
The only hope's in saving America.

36:44.494 --> 36:45.621
SWAGGART: Get back to the good old days.

36:45.704 --> 36:46.955
-JIM: Mm. Mm.
-

36:47.706 --> 36:50.125
Well, I love our country,

36:50.792 --> 36:52.669
but America is for them, too.

36:53.086 --> 36:55.172
-Uh... Well...
-

36:55.255 --> 36:56.256
-Oh, Tam?
-Mm?

36:56.340 --> 36:57.674
Will you mind getting me another Coke?

36:57.758 --> 36:58.967
Jim, let your wife speak.

37:00.385 --> 37:03.180
Debate. I think it gets us
all back to unity.

37:03.347 --> 37:06.099
Oh, I don't want to debate you, Jerry.
I love you.

37:06.266 --> 37:08.310
-I love all of you guys.
-Reverend Falwell.

37:09.269 --> 37:10.270
PAT: Um...

37:10.354 --> 37:12.230
We love you, too, Tammy Faye.

37:12.314 --> 37:13.732
MAN: Yes, we do.

37:15.067 --> 37:16.234
JERRY: God as my witness,

37:16.318 --> 37:20.572
I made a pledge to continue
to expose the sins in this country.

37:21.198 --> 37:24.868
The Bible explicitly
forbids homosexuality.

37:25.077 --> 37:26.787
There's no gray area.

37:27.329 --> 37:28.330
TAMMY: Mm.

37:28.413 --> 37:32.042
Well, you know, I don't think
of them as homosexuals.

37:32.125 --> 37:34.586
I just think of them as other
human beings that I love.

37:35.003 --> 37:38.799
You know, we're all just people
made out of the same old dirt.

37:38.966 --> 37:40.968
And God didn't make any junk.

37:42.177 --> 37:43.178
Right, honey?

37:46.848 --> 37:47.975
-JIM: Tammy?
-Hmm?

37:49.434 --> 37:50.686
-Tam.
-Hmm?

37:50.769 --> 37:52.813
You can't...
What are you doing?

37:52.896 --> 37:54.189
TAMMY: I'm changing the baby, honey.

37:54.272 --> 37:56.608
JIM: You can't talk
to him like that.

37:57.567 --> 38:00.737
That's the big boss man.
We need him to like us.

38:00.904 --> 38:02.572
-Jim.
-No, Tammy.

38:02.739 --> 38:05.659
Look, listen to me.
I'm trying to build something here.

38:06.076 --> 38:07.327
I'm not messing around.

38:07.494 --> 38:10.580
God told me He wants me
to have what Pat has.

38:10.747 --> 38:13.959
But if you keep acting like that,
if you keep talking to Falwell that way,

38:14.042 --> 38:15.293
I'm not gonna ever get there.

38:15.419 --> 38:17.713
Well, God's been talking to me, too,
you know, Jim?

38:17.879 --> 38:19.464
And He said that I gotta speak up.

38:20.674 --> 38:22.217
So, here goes.

38:22.384 --> 38:25.012
You can't leave me at home all alone,

38:25.095 --> 38:27.681
feeling unloved, and useless.

38:29.141 --> 38:32.728
And He said that I belong on TV
just as much as you do.

38:32.894 --> 38:35.522
And that I should sing
and I should be funny.

38:35.605 --> 38:38.358
And I should talk about real things
for grown-ups.

38:38.525 --> 38:40.777
Just, you know, just the way you do.

38:42.821 --> 38:43.822
And...

38:44.865 --> 38:48.702
He says I'm not gonna tell people
who's going to Hell, Jim.

38:49.995 --> 38:52.289
We're in the business of healing people.

38:55.125 --> 38:56.334
Yes.

38:58.003 --> 39:00.797
Jerry Falwell's a powerful man,
Tammy Faye.

39:03.175 --> 39:05.010
Jim Bakker

39:06.303 --> 39:09.306
is a powerful man.

39:09.473 --> 39:11.641
-Jim Bakker.
-

39:15.270 --> 39:18.857
Yes, he is, Tammy Faye Bakker.

39:20.734 --> 39:24.362
I'm so, so sorry.
I forgot my own strength...

39:25.405 --> 39:27.866
and my manly duties.

39:31.078 --> 39:32.954
You know, we built CBN in four years

39:33.038 --> 39:35.373
and we could build our own in half that.

39:36.249 --> 39:38.001
Yes, I think we can.

39:39.544 --> 39:41.505
-Oh, yeah, we can.
-

39:42.631 --> 39:45.133
-Yes.
-

39:45.926 --> 39:49.679
Jim Bakker is gonna
be a builder for Christ.

39:50.347 --> 39:52.349
Oh, yes, he will.

39:52.432 --> 39:55.435
-And Tammy Faye Bakker

39:55.602 --> 40:00.232
is gonna sing her gospel
all around the world.

40:00.398 --> 40:02.442
We are gonna spread His word.

40:02.984 --> 40:03.985
Oh, my!

40:07.531 --> 40:09.324
ANNOUNCER: Coming to you
from Praise The Lord studios

40:09.407 --> 40:10.867
in Charlotte, North Carolina,

40:11.034 --> 40:14.037
broadcasting live
across this great nation.

40:14.830 --> 40:15.914
Praise The Lord television network

40:16.081 --> 40:19.167
presents our five-year anniversary
Christmas special...

40:19.251 --> 40:21.628
the Jim and Tammy Show!

40:21.711 --> 40:22.838
Ooh we're blest

40:24.381 --> 40:26.883
We are blest

40:27.050 --> 40:29.469
Yes, we've got shelter
clothing and strength

40:29.636 --> 40:32.597
We are blest

40:32.764 --> 40:34.891
We're blest, we're blest, we're blest

40:35.058 --> 40:37.936
We are blest

40:38.103 --> 40:43.233
We don't deserve it
but yet we are blest

40:43.400 --> 40:46.820
We don't deserve it but yet we are blest

40:46.903 --> 40:48.446
-Hi, everybody!

40:50.240 --> 40:52.951
Nice to see you.
Hi! How are you?

40:53.410 --> 40:55.579
Look at all of you! Wow!

40:55.662 --> 40:56.997
My land!

40:57.080 --> 40:59.583
What a beautiful audience!
Hi, how are you doing?

40:59.666 --> 41:03.086
God has worked miracles!
I want miracles for all of us!

41:03.253 --> 41:06.339
We've got a marvelous show for you today.
Little Richard is here!

41:06.548 --> 41:07.924
God loves you.

41:08.091 --> 41:09.467
He really does!

41:09.551 --> 41:12.345
REPORTER: They are doing God's work
teaching skills to the homeless.

41:12.554 --> 41:14.097
Providing housing for unwed mothers

41:14.181 --> 41:15.557
and handicapped children.

41:21.771 --> 41:24.357
PTL brings the word of God
and Jesus Christ

41:24.441 --> 41:25.567
-to the whole world.
-That's it.

41:25.734 --> 41:28.153
-God bless you, honey.
-It's a powerful thing!

41:34.701 --> 41:36.703
REPORTER 2: Five years ago,
the PTL network

41:36.786 --> 41:39.623
was little more than a prayer
and a dream.

41:39.831 --> 41:42.167
Today, the nation's
fourth largest network.

41:42.334 --> 41:47.088
We don't deserve it but yet we are blest

41:47.672 --> 41:51.801
We don't deserve it but yet we are blest

41:52.802 --> 41:54.221
Yes, people. We truly are blessed

41:54.387 --> 41:56.389
because there is no condemnation for them

41:56.473 --> 41:57.974
which are in Jesus Christ.

41:58.141 --> 42:01.228
Therefore, if God is for us,
who could be against us?

42:01.394 --> 42:03.688
Blessed are they that hunger
and thirst for His glory,

42:03.772 --> 42:05.857
for they shall be filled.

42:06.024 --> 42:08.902
Blessed are the pure of heart,
for they shall see God.

42:09.069 --> 42:13.031
We have gathered us into His kingdom
and made us priests of God his Father.

42:13.198 --> 42:17.702
Give unto Him everlasting glory,
He rules forever! Amen!

42:17.827 --> 42:19.496
-Amen!

42:19.663 --> 42:21.081
Wow!

42:23.917 --> 42:25.418
My land!

42:29.381 --> 42:31.549
Tammy Faye, ladies and gentlemen,

42:31.633 --> 42:32.634
Tammy Faye Bakker!

42:33.802 --> 42:37.472
And it's the happiest time of the year,
it's Christmas!

42:38.265 --> 42:40.600
And remember, never forget it.

42:41.184 --> 42:44.271
You know what I'm gonna say.
God loves you.

42:44.437 --> 42:46.398
He really, really, really does.

42:46.564 --> 42:48.358
Merry Christmas, everyone!

42:48.525 --> 42:51.069
-Merry Christmas!
-Bye-bye, everybody!

42:51.236 --> 42:52.946
I'm Fletcher, Jim's right-hand man.

42:53.113 --> 42:55.448
Jim and Tammy are gonna be
so happy to see you.

42:55.615 --> 42:58.451
I can't believe you've never
made it down to the studios before.

42:58.535 --> 43:01.329
Well, the Carolinas are a long way
from International Falls.

43:01.454 --> 43:03.665
Have you always been involved
with the church, Mr. Fletcher?

43:03.832 --> 43:05.375
I've done all sorts of things.

43:05.542 --> 43:07.711
Once, I was even a party clown.

43:07.877 --> 43:09.004
You don't believe me, but it's true.

43:09.337 --> 43:10.880
Come, this way.
Show's about to start.

43:10.964 --> 43:11.965
FRED: Party clown?

43:12.048 --> 43:13.258
We'll get you set up.

43:13.425 --> 43:15.719
MAN: But the penile implant
of the inflatable type

43:15.802 --> 43:17.387
is the one that we see here.

43:17.554 --> 43:18.972
Mm-hmm.
And this is the newest one?

43:19.139 --> 43:22.183
Well, it is. And when the man
wants to become erect,

43:22.976 --> 43:24.394
he simply reaches down

43:24.561 --> 43:27.897
and he squeezes that several times

43:28.064 --> 43:29.357
and the man becomes firm.

43:29.482 --> 43:31.484
I think that's fantastic.

43:32.944 --> 43:35.155
-Go ahead, audience, go ahead.
-

43:37.449 --> 43:39.200
Well, you know something else
that's fantastic?

43:39.367 --> 43:41.202
I'm so excited I'm just beside myself.

43:41.411 --> 43:43.621
I would like to introduce you

43:43.788 --> 43:46.875
to my mother and her husband,

43:47.042 --> 43:48.710
Rachel and Fred Grover.

43:49.169 --> 43:51.463
Stand up, everybody, stand up.

43:51.713 --> 43:52.714
Come on. Stand up,

43:52.797 --> 43:54.591
that deserves a big ol' round of applause.

43:56.926 --> 43:58.470
Stand up, Mom.

44:04.517 --> 44:05.727
TAMMY: Thank you.

44:05.894 --> 44:07.562
So, here's the house.

44:07.729 --> 44:10.607
Isn't it beautiful?
I just think it's so neat.

44:10.690 --> 44:13.777
Our ministry's building lots of houses
on the PTL property.

44:13.943 --> 44:16.488
There's one with pregnant teens
and one for kids with needs.

44:16.654 --> 44:18.198
It's all part of our mission
to help people.

44:18.365 --> 44:20.158
FRED: This is just wonderful, honey.

44:20.325 --> 44:21.659
Yeah, I'm so glad you guys are here.

44:21.785 --> 44:23.286
I got you set up in the guest room

44:23.453 --> 44:26.122
and you can stay there
until your new house is ready.

44:26.581 --> 44:28.958
Come on.
Let me give you a tour.

44:29.125 --> 44:32.754
This is the relaxation room.

44:33.797 --> 44:36.716
Oh, now that you're here,
I'm just gonna bug you any time I want to.

44:36.883 --> 44:39.511
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna wake you up
any hour of the night.

44:39.677 --> 44:42.222
I'm just so glad to have you here
in the PTL property with me, Mom.

44:43.890 --> 44:46.643
All those people looking at me
and clapping.

44:46.810 --> 44:47.936
Oh, no.

44:48.103 --> 44:50.271
RACHEL: I don't appreciate
being bamboozled like that.

44:50.438 --> 44:51.564
It's love, Mom.

44:52.315 --> 44:53.817
Oh, yeah, that's God's love.

44:53.983 --> 44:56.653
Every day, I have rapture.

44:56.820 --> 44:57.821
RACHEL: Rapture?

44:57.987 --> 45:01.616
You just spent an hour talking
about pumping penises.

45:03.868 --> 45:05.328
Well, these things happen to people

45:05.495 --> 45:08.373
and I'm just being honest
about the way that life is.

45:08.540 --> 45:11.376
And I'm providing solutions

45:11.543 --> 45:13.211
to make marriages better.

45:13.378 --> 45:15.046
-Tam, where's the privy?
-On the left.

45:15.213 --> 45:16.214
Okay.

45:16.423 --> 45:17.465
Sit down, Mom.

45:18.341 --> 45:20.176
Who paid for this house, Tammy?

45:20.468 --> 45:21.886
Well, the ministry makes lots of houses.

45:22.053 --> 45:23.805
We've got one for unwed mothers.

45:23.888 --> 45:25.014
Wait till you see Kevin's House.

45:25.390 --> 45:27.809
Oh, yeah, that one's for kids
with special needs.

45:27.976 --> 45:30.728
And it's named after a sweet little boy
named Kevin.

45:30.854 --> 45:31.855
Oh, he's 13 years old

45:32.063 --> 45:35.275
and he is the sweetest,
tiniest little thing you ever saw.

45:35.442 --> 45:37.652
His hands are attached to his shoulders

45:37.819 --> 45:39.529
and he has no arms at all.

45:39.696 --> 45:40.905
Bless his little heart.

45:41.739 --> 45:43.408
Let me show you to your room.

45:46.619 --> 45:48.163
Okay, everyone,
let's see if I can do this.

45:48.329 --> 45:50.874
So, now, you're gonna
go in a circle.

45:50.957 --> 45:54.043
Oh, mine looks a little bit
like it had an explosion.

45:54.127 --> 45:55.420
-You know what I'm gonna do?

45:55.503 --> 45:58.214
'Cause normally when I use frosting,
it's not this thick.

45:58.298 --> 45:59.299
I'm just gonna do that.

45:59.382 --> 46:00.717
-I think it's gonna be pretty.
-

46:00.800 --> 46:02.427
You know, next time,
I'm gonna make you guys my fudge.

46:02.510 --> 46:04.512
That's the best.
I think I've only made that,

46:04.596 --> 46:07.223
you know, on the show,
like, a couple times. Mm.

46:07.307 --> 46:09.100
I know! I wish we had smell-o-vision,

46:09.184 --> 46:10.185
-so you could smell this.
-

46:10.268 --> 46:11.895
This is really nice.

46:18.193 --> 46:19.360
Oh!

46:19.444 --> 46:21.070
That one.
How much time do we have?

46:21.154 --> 46:22.155
MAN: 10 minutes, Tammy.

46:22.322 --> 46:23.823
Oh, goodness!

46:27.619 --> 46:29.162
Wasn't that fun?

46:29.329 --> 46:32.165
I'm not sure what's so Christian
about decorating a cupcake.

46:32.332 --> 46:34.709
Oh, Mom, you're so funny.

46:34.792 --> 46:36.503
-Have you seen this?
-TAMMY: Hmm?

46:36.586 --> 46:37.712
From The Observer.

46:37.879 --> 46:39.839
Picture of you and Jim on the front.

46:39.923 --> 46:40.924
Ah.

46:41.007 --> 46:43.468
"PTL's Bakker diverts ministry funds

46:43.635 --> 46:46.012
"for new building project."

46:46.513 --> 46:47.764
What's that about?

46:49.265 --> 46:50.642
Well, you can't believe everything

46:50.725 --> 46:52.477
that you read in the newspapers, Mom.

46:52.644 --> 46:54.270
How's Fred doing?
Is he settling in okay?

46:54.354 --> 46:57.649
Smoke and fire
idn't just the providence of Hell, girl.

46:57.815 --> 46:59.734
You know when I saw that
clipping with my face on it,

46:59.817 --> 47:01.653
I thought for a second
that you were proud of me.

47:02.779 --> 47:06.366
I'm hearing there are articles like this
in the paper every day.

47:07.033 --> 47:08.618
The secular press hates us

47:08.701 --> 47:11.621
because we're winning
millions of souls for Jesus.

47:12.664 --> 47:14.040
Oh, Tammy Faye.

47:14.207 --> 47:15.792
You follow blindly.

47:15.959 --> 47:18.628
In the end, all you are is blind.

47:21.297 --> 47:22.715
JIM: I don't know how to do it.

47:22.882 --> 47:25.093
I just need it done.
That is your job.

47:25.260 --> 47:26.261
Yes.

47:27.387 --> 47:28.388
Yes.

47:28.555 --> 47:29.556
God bless you.

47:42.068 --> 47:44.195
You wonder why I don't snuggle you.

47:45.738 --> 47:48.908
Maybe it's all that goopy stuff on you.

47:49.951 --> 47:54.289
Well, it's better than
spending the night with an alligator.

47:57.041 --> 47:58.543
That newspaper.

47:59.544 --> 48:02.213
She saved it like
it was a little treasure.

48:03.214 --> 48:05.508
It made me feel so rotten.

48:06.676 --> 48:09.387
Well, your mother's never been
all that nice to you.

48:10.013 --> 48:11.222
Yeah.

48:11.848 --> 48:13.600
Some people just don't change.

48:14.851 --> 48:17.312
We're not doing anything wrong, though.

48:25.570 --> 48:27.405
Is that a question?

48:28.656 --> 48:29.657
No.

48:35.872 --> 48:38.708
-

48:46.716 --> 48:48.301
Tammy, sometimes, I fear

48:48.384 --> 48:51.554
that what God wants of me
is beyond my abilities.

48:52.472 --> 48:54.140
I'm building so much for Him

48:54.223 --> 48:57.143
in His name and for His people.

48:57.894 --> 48:59.187
-Yeah.
-And...

49:00.021 --> 49:01.981
And He's giving me
more visions every day.

49:02.065 --> 49:04.275
Giving me more orders all the time.

49:04.359 --> 49:07.070
And then, every day, these creditors...

49:08.863 --> 49:12.241
...and the people who are asking me
to save them.

49:14.577 --> 49:16.287
-I'm only one man.
-

49:16.371 --> 49:17.622
I'm only one man, Tammy.

49:17.705 --> 49:18.998
TAMMY: Oh, Jim.

49:20.375 --> 49:22.960
Well, I only need one man.

49:23.127 --> 49:24.587
You're enough, honey.

49:26.506 --> 49:28.132
Okay, come on. Come to bed.

49:29.384 --> 49:31.427
Honey, it's been two months,

49:31.594 --> 49:34.430
and we said we were gonna try
to have another baby.

49:34.597 --> 49:36.265
Tammy, I need your help.

49:36.766 --> 49:39.185
I need you not to get in my way.

49:39.352 --> 49:42.188
And I need you to not ask
more of me than I can give.

49:42.355 --> 49:43.356
Okay.

49:44.857 --> 49:46.317
Do you wanna talk some more?

49:47.026 --> 49:49.278
-

49:52.740 --> 49:54.826
-Can you...
-

49:54.909 --> 49:56.327
Can you talk to God?

49:57.995 --> 50:00.039
-I'm so tired and...
-

50:02.667 --> 50:03.668
Yes?

50:04.919 --> 50:06.254
I'll call you right back.

50:07.672 --> 50:08.756
I'll take it downstairs.

50:21.227 --> 50:22.478
Don't give up

50:23.020 --> 50:25.314
You're on the brink

50:25.481 --> 50:29.485
Of a miracle

50:29.652 --> 50:31.654
Don't give up

50:31.821 --> 50:36.200
Remember you're not alone

50:37.702 --> 50:42.081
People, don't give up
You're on the brink

50:42.248 --> 50:45.626
Of a miracle

50:45.793 --> 50:49.797
Don't give up on the brink

50:49.964 --> 50:54.010
-Of a miracle
-

50:54.177 --> 50:56.137
Don't give in

50:56.304 --> 50:59.974
God is still on the throne

51:00.183 --> 51:02.226
He's on His throne

51:02.643 --> 51:04.687
-Don't give up
-

51:04.854 --> 51:06.647
You nailed it.

51:06.814 --> 51:08.024
Really?

51:08.649 --> 51:11.235
This is sublime.
This is top drawer.

51:12.195 --> 51:13.696
You really think so, Gary?

51:14.322 --> 51:15.406
I know so.

51:15.573 --> 51:17.283
Your opinion means so much to me.

51:17.450 --> 51:19.243
I haven't been this excited
about working with an artist

51:19.410 --> 51:20.953
since I produced Monster Mash.

51:21.871 --> 51:24.373
That's really sweet.

51:24.916 --> 51:26.626
We could get a Grammy.

51:26.959 --> 51:28.920
-Really?
-Really.

51:34.967 --> 51:37.011
Tammy, it's time to go.
Time for the shoot.

51:37.136 --> 51:38.387
Come on. We're...

51:39.347 --> 51:40.681
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

51:40.765 --> 51:41.808
-Yeah.
-We've been looking for you,

51:41.891 --> 51:44.227
so, let's go.
We're live in 15 minutes.

51:44.435 --> 51:46.062
Hey, hey, Jim, how are ya?

51:46.854 --> 51:48.314
Blessed, Gary, blessed.

51:48.397 --> 51:50.733
I'm sorry, Jim.
You know, I got lost in the music.

51:50.900 --> 51:53.945
Gary here,
he just makes it all so awesome.

51:54.028 --> 51:55.279
-Wait till you hear it.

51:55.363 --> 51:56.364
You're going to love it.

51:56.447 --> 51:57.990
No, it's her voice, Jim.

51:58.074 --> 52:01.327
I just turn the knobs here.
She sings like an angel.

52:02.537 --> 52:05.331
Well, I'm never giving you
back to Nashville, oh, no!

52:06.249 --> 52:08.209
It's such a beautiful way
to connect, Jim.

52:08.376 --> 52:10.169
It's God's voice through my voice.

52:10.336 --> 52:11.754
To the world's ears.

52:12.338 --> 52:13.631
The things you say, Gary.

52:14.757 --> 52:16.634
Tammy! You're not camera ready.

52:16.801 --> 52:18.636
You know everybody's waiting for you
and it's a big day.

52:18.803 --> 52:21.305
We gotta do 400 K today.
Can we shake a leg, please?

52:21.472 --> 52:23.391
Thank you.
I'm sorry to drag her away, Gary.

52:25.977 --> 52:27.061
Shake a leg, please.

52:27.228 --> 52:28.354
Sure thing, Mister.

52:28.437 --> 52:29.647
Thank you.

52:29.814 --> 52:31.274
-GARY: Jim.
-Thank you, Gary.

52:32.149 --> 52:33.276
-Tam?
-Mm?

52:39.198 --> 52:40.867
-TAMMY: Ta-da! I made it!
-

52:41.826 --> 52:43.286
MAN: 30 seconds, everyone!

52:44.579 --> 52:45.705
WOMAN: Light on one, please!

52:49.250 --> 52:51.460
Hmm. How's that?

52:51.627 --> 52:52.670
MAN 2: Yeah.

52:56.132 --> 52:59.427
MAN 3: And we're live in five, four,

52:59.594 --> 53:02.388
three, two...

53:06.517 --> 53:10.771
Tammy and I are undergoing
the most vicious attacks

53:10.938 --> 53:13.232
in the history of this ministry.

53:14.525 --> 53:18.613
By now, perhaps you think
that we should be used to these attacks.

53:19.572 --> 53:21.866
But it's been going on
for a long time, Tammy.

53:22.033 --> 53:23.284
Oh, yeah, that's right, Jim.

53:23.367 --> 53:25.369
It's been going on a long time.

53:26.245 --> 53:29.123
We are being persecuted
by the secular press

53:29.290 --> 53:33.753
who simply do not want you
to receive the word of God.

53:34.545 --> 53:36.130
JIM: It is a witch hunt.

53:36.297 --> 53:39.926
And on top of this,
we have numerous past due bills...

53:40.009 --> 53:41.344
that must be paid

53:41.427 --> 53:43.846
if we want to save the entire network

53:43.971 --> 53:46.849
and stay on the air
delivering the word of God every day.

53:47.016 --> 53:50.061
So, now is the time
for our prayer warriors

53:50.227 --> 53:53.105
to rise up because we are in a war.

53:53.898 --> 53:58.194
You know, Tammy and I,
we just hate to do this,

54:00.071 --> 54:02.156
but if every person watching

54:02.239 --> 54:05.576
could double their pledge right now,

54:06.452 --> 54:09.789
that way, we can save
the word of God.

54:09.956 --> 54:11.832
I'm talking about salvation.

54:11.999 --> 54:16.796
Yours, mine, PTL's, the entire world's.

54:16.963 --> 54:20.216
So, together, if we agree together,

54:20.383 --> 54:23.177
let's give the devil a black eye.

54:24.553 --> 54:27.056
Oh, the phones are ringing. Oh.

54:27.139 --> 54:30.393
-Praise Jesus and praise you!
-

54:30.559 --> 54:33.104
And God bless you!
God bless you!

54:33.187 --> 54:34.522
TAMMY: Hallelujah!

54:34.689 --> 54:38.025
And don't forget, remember,
God loves you.

54:38.567 --> 54:41.904
-He really, really does.
-He really does.

54:45.449 --> 54:46.575
MAN: Cut! Very good, everyone.

54:46.659 --> 54:48.160
That was not bad. How was that?

54:48.327 --> 54:50.955
-How was it?
-Uh, that was good, Jim.

54:51.038 --> 54:53.124
-We need to talk. Now.
-Jim, it was great.

54:53.290 --> 54:55.751
FLETCHER: We're still gonna
be over budget on that...

54:59.088 --> 55:01.966
TAMMY: I just want the sleeves
a little shorter.

55:02.174 --> 55:04.010
Everything's about proportion.

55:05.720 --> 55:08.305
Okay, you ready to see?
Close your eyes.

55:10.349 --> 55:12.810
-I love it, Mother.
-

55:13.310 --> 55:14.979
Oh, Sissy, you look so beautiful, baby.

55:15.146 --> 55:16.439
-Thank you.
-

55:16.605 --> 55:18.774
RACHEL: Golly Moses,
this thing weighs a ton.

55:19.483 --> 55:20.526
Oh, goodness.

55:20.609 --> 55:22.445
RACHEL: Why do you have to do
so much shopping, Tam?

55:22.570 --> 55:24.905
Well, I have to get my exercise somehow.

55:25.072 --> 55:28.284
And, plus, I don't wanna balloon up
with the new baby coming.

55:28.451 --> 55:30.578
Hey, everyone,
come here, come here.

55:31.287 --> 55:32.288
Now, when she comes out,

55:32.455 --> 55:35.207
make sure you all tell her
how great she looks, okay?

55:35.374 --> 55:36.876
You know, she hasn't had
enough love in her life,

55:36.959 --> 55:40.087
and it's time that we all change that.

55:41.422 --> 55:42.423
Go on.

55:47.720 --> 55:49.430
Good grief.

55:49.597 --> 55:53.976
You look so good! Come here.
You do.

55:54.143 --> 55:55.311
Right?

55:55.478 --> 55:56.562
Okay, get up on the pedestal.

55:56.729 --> 55:57.813
I am not getting up on the pedestal.

55:57.980 --> 55:59.065
-Come on, Grandma.
-Come on.

55:59.231 --> 56:00.566
-Come on.
-Don't push me.

56:02.109 --> 56:04.278
Isn't it fun?
We look like triplets.

56:04.445 --> 56:06.447
I look like a bear.

56:06.614 --> 56:08.199
You look like a beautiful bear.

56:08.657 --> 56:10.868
-Oh. It's too much.
-No.

56:10.951 --> 56:12.578
RACHEL: I already have a coat.

56:13.079 --> 56:14.622
I don't need it.

56:15.831 --> 56:18.918
Why are you so unwilling to accept
the love that God has for you?

56:20.002 --> 56:21.504
Can you pay for this?

56:21.670 --> 56:23.714
The pledges are rolling in, Mom.

56:23.881 --> 56:25.966
People really like the show

56:26.133 --> 56:29.970
and they're very happy to accept the love.

56:31.722 --> 56:33.182
Take the coat, Mom.

56:33.724 --> 56:35.935
Just take the coat.

56:36.018 --> 56:37.061
RACHEL: Well...

56:37.144 --> 56:38.938
TAMMY: Please, for me.

56:40.481 --> 56:44.902
Well, it is attractive,
and it's very, very warm.

56:46.153 --> 56:47.279
JIM: I just feel like a million dollars.

56:47.363 --> 56:49.156
WANDA: It looks great, Jim.
JIM: You think?

56:49.240 --> 56:50.407
Yeah, very subtle.

56:50.574 --> 56:52.409
I didn't feel a thing. Not a thing.

56:52.576 --> 56:54.286
And I played golf the next day.

56:54.453 --> 56:55.454
So, we'll have a girl's night.

56:55.538 --> 56:56.580
We'll go to Maciano's, get some pasta.

56:56.664 --> 56:57.665
SISSY: Yes, yes.

56:57.748 --> 56:59.416
-I love that place.
-Yeah? Oh, wait.

56:59.500 --> 57:02.002
You know, why don't you go ahead,
I'm gonna catch up.

57:02.211 --> 57:04.171
-I'm gonna go give Jim a kiss.
-Okay.

57:04.338 --> 57:05.339
See ya.

57:06.674 --> 57:08.592
And that reporter from
The Charlotte Observer

57:08.676 --> 57:10.261
-been poking around.
-

57:10.344 --> 57:13.055
Calling some of our secretaries,
asking for comments.

57:13.139 --> 57:14.890
I'm gonna put a picture
of that guy's butt...

57:14.974 --> 57:17.852
-...on a punching bag

57:18.018 --> 57:20.187
and I'm gonna use it for practice.

57:21.355 --> 57:22.898
FLETCHER: We need to talk
about the deficit

57:22.982 --> 57:24.692
we are running
on the expansion to studio...

57:24.900 --> 57:27.778
JIM: Phooey! Fletcher, no,
you're such a worrywart.

57:27.945 --> 57:29.905
We're gonna do a telethon next week.

57:30.072 --> 57:31.949
The partners will not let us down.

57:32.116 --> 57:33.617
Wanda, my nose is shiny.

57:33.701 --> 57:34.869
WANDA: Mm-mm.
JIM: Yes, it is.

57:34.952 --> 57:36.245
-WANDA: No.
-I'm telling you, Wanda.

57:36.328 --> 57:38.038
-It's fine.
-A little more powder, please.

57:38.205 --> 57:39.498
FLETCHER:
Your nose isn't shiny, Jim.

57:39.582 --> 57:40.791
You're just being fussy.

57:40.875 --> 57:42.418
-FLETCHER: Wanda, tell him he's fussy.

57:42.501 --> 57:43.919
You're fussy, Pastor Jim.

57:44.003 --> 57:45.045
JIM: Oh, how dare you.

57:45.129 --> 57:46.964
You're wearing as much
as Tammy these days.

57:48.507 --> 57:50.426
Careful, you'll end up
looking like a clown.

57:52.094 --> 57:54.430
-Stop it! You can't talk...
-But you know it's true.

57:54.513 --> 57:55.723
-You know it's true.
-JIM: Fletcher.

57:55.806 --> 57:57.516
You got Wanda laughing.

57:57.600 --> 57:59.226
FLETCHER: She's not laughing.
What are you laughing at?

57:59.310 --> 58:00.477
-It's not funny.

58:00.561 --> 58:02.271
It's not funny.

58:02.438 --> 58:03.814
You guys!

58:04.023 --> 58:06.066
Oh, I got a new one.

58:06.233 --> 58:08.277
Penny, cover your ears.

58:08.444 --> 58:10.029
What did the leper say to the prostitute?

58:10.196 --> 58:11.614
-Oh, boy.
-What?

58:11.780 --> 58:13.407
"You can keep the tip."

58:13.490 --> 58:14.658
-Oh, shit.

58:16.410 --> 58:19.079
Jim, you mean jerk!
You're gonna pay for that.

58:19.246 --> 58:21.207
JIM: I went too far.
I went too far. I'm sorry.

58:22.458 --> 58:24.710
-I got you now. I got you now.
-JIM: Wanda! Wanda!

58:24.793 --> 58:25.836
FLETCHER: Wanda, come here.

58:25.920 --> 58:27.171
Come here and powder his nose.

58:27.254 --> 58:28.464
JIM: No! No!
FLETCHER: "Wanda, help.

58:28.547 --> 58:30.299
-"Wanda. Wanda.
-

58:31.258 --> 58:32.968
"My nose is shiny."

58:34.178 --> 58:37.389
Let me powder your nose.
Let me powder your nose.

58:53.155 --> 58:56.200
Somebody touched me

58:56.367 --> 58:57.701
Hallelujah

58:57.868 --> 59:01.538
Somebody touched me

59:02.039 --> 59:06.460
Oh, I was blind
But praise His name

59:06.627 --> 59:09.171
I now can see

59:10.965 --> 59:15.052
I was in darkness

59:15.219 --> 59:19.348
When Jesus found me

59:19.515 --> 59:23.394
But since He touched me

59:25.604 --> 59:31.402
I now am free

59:32.528 --> 59:33.612
-Wow.

59:33.696 --> 59:35.489
That was beautiful.
That was lovely, Tam.

59:35.656 --> 59:36.949
Gary.

59:38.450 --> 59:40.244
Aren't you glad He touched you?

59:40.411 --> 59:42.121
Truly. Yeah.

59:45.958 --> 59:48.002
Well, this is perfect. I love this.

59:48.168 --> 59:50.087
Well, it's all you,
Tam, it's all you.

59:50.254 --> 59:54.508
Oh, no. No, no.
You know I couldn't do this without you.

59:54.675 --> 59:58.220
You know, your voice
makes me feel closer to Him.

59:58.971 --> 1:00:00.973
Like He's right here.

1:00:02.766 --> 1:00:03.934
He is.

1:00:09.106 --> 1:00:13.319
when was the last time
that you were touched

1:00:15.029 --> 1:00:17.573
in the way that a woman
like you should be touched?

1:00:18.699 --> 1:00:21.243
Oh, well...

1:00:22.619 --> 1:00:23.829
I'm eight months pregnant, Gary,

1:00:23.912 --> 1:00:25.456
so back it up from there.

1:00:26.749 --> 1:00:30.461
Does his touch tell you
how talented you are?

1:00:33.630 --> 1:00:34.631
Gary.

1:00:34.840 --> 1:00:37.634
Do his eyes tell you
how beautiful you are?

1:00:40.971 --> 1:00:43.390
Does he listen to you?

1:00:43.557 --> 1:00:45.559
Does he hear how amazing you are?

1:00:46.602 --> 1:00:47.811
Tammy.

1:00:47.978 --> 1:00:49.271
Yes.

1:00:49.855 --> 1:00:51.899
Can I touch you like that?

1:00:52.775 --> 1:00:57.071
In that way that you should be touched.

1:01:01.492 --> 1:01:02.534
You can kiss me

1:01:02.618 --> 1:01:03.702
-on my neck.
-Okay.

1:01:03.786 --> 1:01:05.829
-Don't leave a mark, okay?
-Yeah.

1:01:07.164 --> 1:01:10.000
-

1:01:15.798 --> 1:01:17.800
-

1:01:19.051 --> 1:01:20.260
Come here.

1:01:21.261 --> 1:01:23.097
I wanna hold you.

1:01:28.936 --> 1:01:31.480
-Oh, no. Oh, no.
-What?

1:01:31.563 --> 1:01:33.357
-Leave them on.
-All right.

1:01:34.274 --> 1:01:35.526
Oh, you're so beautiful, Tammy.

1:01:35.692 --> 1:01:36.944
Oh, you're so big.

1:01:37.111 --> 1:01:38.654
Oh, yeah.

1:01:39.738 --> 1:01:40.906
I like this.

1:01:41.073 --> 1:01:42.199
Yeah.

1:01:47.329 --> 1:01:49.039
What? What's wrong?

1:01:49.540 --> 1:01:51.041
My water broke.

1:01:54.753 --> 1:01:55.754
TAMMY: Mm.

1:01:56.964 --> 1:01:58.799
You're so beautiful.

1:02:00.259 --> 1:02:01.593
-

1:02:06.765 --> 1:02:08.308
He's so precious, Jim.

1:02:18.026 --> 1:02:19.653
GARY: Congratulations, Jim.

1:02:37.963 --> 1:02:40.966
I understand
that Gary drove you here?

1:02:42.676 --> 1:02:45.304
GARY: We called the studio, Jim,
but you were on the air.

1:02:46.263 --> 1:02:49.308
Tammy was real upset
that you weren't here for it.

1:02:51.935 --> 1:02:56.857
I'm just wonderful, Jim.
I'm... I'm so wonderful.

1:02:58.775 --> 1:03:02.613
We announced his birth on air.
We got a real surge in pledges.

1:03:03.197 --> 1:03:04.198
Praise the Lord.

1:03:04.364 --> 1:03:06.283
We're gonna get
that expansion in Studio 3,

1:03:06.366 --> 1:03:08.285
thanks to this little miracle.

1:03:08.744 --> 1:03:10.454
GARY: Hmm. Congrats, Jim.

1:03:11.079 --> 1:03:13.081
This is such a day of joy.

1:03:15.918 --> 1:03:17.544
A day of celebration,

1:03:17.711 --> 1:03:22.633
but I just can't help the feeling
that something else is going on here.

1:03:24.551 --> 1:03:26.553
That something depraved

1:03:27.679 --> 1:03:28.931
taints this day.

1:03:31.391 --> 1:03:34.978
GARY: Depraved is a very big word, Jim.

1:03:35.771 --> 1:03:37.814
But it's a fitting word, isn't it, Tammy?

1:03:42.778 --> 1:03:44.321
Yes, Jim.

1:03:51.912 --> 1:03:55.415
Well, Fletcher's waiting outside

1:03:56.250 --> 1:03:58.710
and he'll get this man back to Nashville,
where he belongs.

1:03:58.794 --> 1:04:00.754
-Oh, no. Jim, please, no.
-JIM: Tammy.

1:04:00.963 --> 1:04:02.714
TAMMY: Please.
JIM: Tammy, I suggest

1:04:02.798 --> 1:04:04.424
you don't talk right now.

1:04:05.968 --> 1:04:07.052
Tammy.

1:04:08.720 --> 1:04:11.014
Tammy, I hope you're not gonna
let him do this.

1:04:11.473 --> 1:04:13.225
-Tammy?

1:04:13.392 --> 1:04:16.603
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

1:04:17.771 --> 1:04:19.106
Sorry.

1:04:19.189 --> 1:04:20.857
-

1:04:22.067 --> 1:04:23.819
I'm so sorry, Jim.

1:04:28.240 --> 1:04:29.950
I'm so sorry.

1:04:39.418 --> 1:04:41.003
Can you take the baby away from her,
please?

1:04:41.169 --> 1:04:43.255
NURSE: Okay. All right.

1:04:47.134 --> 1:04:49.636
Let me get you something to
help you sleep, okay, honey?

1:05:16.663 --> 1:05:20.125
Yes.
That's exactly what I told you.

1:05:20.459 --> 1:05:22.919
Formal living quarters
for some of the staff.

1:05:23.003 --> 1:05:24.004
MAN: Wow!

1:05:24.087 --> 1:05:25.297
-JIM: Yes.
-So ornate.

1:05:25.464 --> 1:05:27.507
JIM: Inspired by European architect.

1:05:27.674 --> 1:05:29.676
And over here,

1:05:29.843 --> 1:05:33.180
that's the first Christian water park.

1:05:33.347 --> 1:05:34.890
"We are fishers of men."

1:05:35.057 --> 1:05:36.350
That's the bait.

1:05:37.017 --> 1:05:38.644
-That's good.

1:05:38.727 --> 1:05:39.811
JIM: I wanted to show you this, too.

1:05:39.895 --> 1:05:42.022
See, over here... Yes.

1:05:42.189 --> 1:05:45.400
This is Old Jerusalem.

1:05:45.609 --> 1:05:47.653
And it's a stunning replica.

1:05:48.028 --> 1:05:49.821
Oh, it looks beautiful, Jim.

1:05:49.988 --> 1:05:51.156
-Yeah.
-So detailed.

1:05:53.909 --> 1:05:56.995
You know what they say about details?
God is in 'em.

1:05:57.079 --> 1:05:59.164
Yes.
-That's right.

1:05:59.831 --> 1:06:01.667
You know,
for as long as I can remember, Roe,

1:06:01.750 --> 1:06:05.504
I've dreamed of a vacation destination
for Christian families to come to.

1:06:05.671 --> 1:06:07.798
A place where they can, um...

1:06:08.548 --> 1:06:09.633
Hey, Tam.

1:06:09.841 --> 1:06:11.009
A place where they know

1:06:11.093 --> 1:06:12.886
that their children are gonna be safe,
you know?

1:06:13.053 --> 1:06:14.096
ROE: Sure.

1:06:14.262 --> 1:06:15.806
We're selling partnerships to fund it.

1:06:16.515 --> 1:06:18.058
And that way, the partners,

1:06:18.141 --> 1:06:19.685
they feel the sense of ownership

1:06:20.352 --> 1:06:24.564
and a pride in this Christian paradise

1:06:25.107 --> 1:06:26.400
that they've built.

1:06:26.942 --> 1:06:33.490
Uh... Um, how many partnerships
do you have to sell in order to fund it?

1:06:33.573 --> 1:06:34.700
JIM: Hmm. Well...

1:06:41.790 --> 1:06:42.791
Yes.

1:06:42.874 --> 1:06:45.252
You know, because the partnerships
we've already sold,

1:06:46.795 --> 1:06:49.923
they've had to go
to funding other projects.

1:06:50.841 --> 1:06:52.634
-I see.
-Yes.

1:06:53.385 --> 1:06:54.594
But I've been praying on it.

1:06:55.262 --> 1:06:57.264
I've been hoping
that you could advance PTL

1:06:57.347 --> 1:06:58.807
just a little bit of credit.

1:07:00.142 --> 1:07:04.062
Just to get the bulldozers moving,
you know?

1:07:07.858 --> 1:07:08.900
Hi, honey.

1:07:10.444 --> 1:07:12.779
Uh, this is Roe Messner.

1:07:12.946 --> 1:07:14.823
He's the developer of Heritage USA.

1:07:14.990 --> 1:07:16.533
Well, I'm not the developer yet.

1:07:16.616 --> 1:07:18.034
Yeah.

1:07:18.201 --> 1:07:19.202
Hi.

1:07:24.249 --> 1:07:28.545
The doctors have had
her on so many loopy things

1:07:28.962 --> 1:07:31.548
since Jamie Charles was born.

1:07:31.715 --> 1:07:34.926
Pills to make her normal.
Pills to make her sleep.

1:07:35.093 --> 1:07:36.678
Um, as long as she's feelin' better.

1:07:38.430 --> 1:07:40.599
Yes. Amen.

1:07:41.975 --> 1:07:44.936
I love what you're trying to do here, Jim.

1:07:45.020 --> 1:07:46.646
JIM: Mm.
ROE: I do.

1:07:46.813 --> 1:07:48.982
I spent some summers with my wife

1:07:49.065 --> 1:07:50.317
at Knott's Berry Farm.

1:07:51.610 --> 1:07:54.279
Every year the jellies
got less and less fresh.

1:07:54.529 --> 1:07:56.573
-JIM: Mm.
-And I'm convinced

1:07:56.740 --> 1:07:59.951
it's 'cause they started
hiring the wrong kinds of people

1:08:00.118 --> 1:08:01.119
to make the preserves.

1:08:02.829 --> 1:08:04.539
I knew you were my man, Roe.

1:08:04.623 --> 1:08:06.792
But, uh...

1:08:07.959 --> 1:08:09.586
I'm not a gambler, Mr. Bakker.

1:08:10.587 --> 1:08:13.048
-Oh, well...
-Oh, this isn't gambling, Roe.

1:08:14.299 --> 1:08:15.509
Oh, no, it's faith.

1:08:16.968 --> 1:08:19.596
I have seen him perform miracles.

1:08:20.555 --> 1:08:21.556
ROE: Huh.

1:08:21.640 --> 1:08:24.643
I haven't had anyone
claim to be a faith healer to my face

1:08:28.814 --> 1:08:31.942
Well, buildings are miracles.

1:08:32.275 --> 1:08:33.276
Aren't they, Roe?

1:08:33.443 --> 1:08:36.696
Well, it's amazing
anything ever gets built, that's for sure.

1:08:37.364 --> 1:08:38.865
Yeah.

1:08:39.032 --> 1:08:40.909
This is beautiful.

1:08:41.743 --> 1:08:44.621
We must take a leap of faith for God.

1:08:44.788 --> 1:08:48.208
Especially when the Devil
is makin' us doubt.

1:08:48.834 --> 1:08:50.961
God's on our side, Roe.

1:08:52.504 --> 1:08:54.297
Every time we fall,

1:08:55.090 --> 1:08:57.551
God proves His love again

1:08:58.468 --> 1:09:00.846
and we come back.

1:09:00.929 --> 1:09:06.309
We come back bigger,
and stronger, and better.

1:09:12.440 --> 1:09:17.612
"All things work for good
to them that love God,

1:09:18.822 --> 1:09:25.412
"to them who are called
according to His purpose."

1:09:33.420 --> 1:09:36.089
And I called you, Roe.

1:09:49.436 --> 1:09:51.479
-You're welcome.

1:09:55.108 --> 1:09:57.193
You're owed a "thank you"?

1:09:58.570 --> 1:10:01.406
He was nowhere near saying yes
until I sat down.

1:10:01.865 --> 1:10:05.118
Oh, yes, to flirt with him.

1:10:09.915 --> 1:10:11.917
Are you gonna divorce me, Jim?

1:10:13.001 --> 1:10:14.002
I don't know.

1:10:16.338 --> 1:10:17.339
I should.

1:10:20.550 --> 1:10:23.053
But God hates divorce.

1:10:23.219 --> 1:10:25.180
It ruined your mother.

1:10:26.181 --> 1:10:27.182
It'll do the same to you.

1:10:27.849 --> 1:10:29.976
You stopped paying attention to me, Jim.

1:10:30.060 --> 1:10:32.896
You broke faith with me, Tammy!

1:10:33.063 --> 1:10:37.859
Gary, he told me that I was beautiful
and that I was talented.

1:10:37.943 --> 1:10:39.319
-And he wanted me, Jim.
-

1:10:39.402 --> 1:10:40.528
Don't touch me!

1:10:40.612 --> 1:10:44.240
Gary wanted me, Jim,
in ways that you don't.

1:10:44.407 --> 1:10:45.909
JIM: Oh, my goodness.

1:10:46.201 --> 1:10:48.078
He was my friend.

1:10:48.328 --> 1:10:50.914
You know, I got a letter this week, Tammy.

1:10:51.081 --> 1:10:52.415
From the President.

1:10:52.999 --> 1:10:55.251
The President of the United States,

1:10:55.418 --> 1:10:57.879
Ronald Reagan himself,
wrote me a personal letter

1:10:58.046 --> 1:11:02.008
thanking me for my support
in his election!

1:11:02.884 --> 1:11:05.553
I'm an important man, Tammy Faye!

1:11:05.720 --> 1:11:09.516
And people don't treat important men
the way that you treated me.

1:11:10.684 --> 1:11:11.977
-

1:11:12.060 --> 1:11:13.436
I'm gonna clear my head, I'm gonna pray.

1:11:15.438 --> 1:11:16.982
I'm gonna think about what I want.

1:11:22.904 --> 1:11:24.406
Jim?

1:11:47.095 --> 1:11:50.807
Oh, God. How can I fix this?

1:11:53.977 --> 1:11:55.812
God?

1:11:58.106 --> 1:11:59.399
Where'd you go?

1:12:00.567 --> 1:12:02.027
Where are you?

1:12:03.278 --> 1:12:05.155
Why can't I feel you?

1:12:08.033 --> 1:12:09.409
Where are you?

1:12:17.042 --> 1:12:18.543
Where are you?

1:12:18.710 --> 1:12:20.712
Tammy? Tammy, it's all right.

1:12:20.879 --> 1:12:23.923
-Jim.
-I'm here. I'm here.

1:12:24.174 --> 1:12:26.926
It's all right. Shh. It's all right.

1:12:31.890 --> 1:12:32.891
Um...

1:12:33.850 --> 1:12:35.894
-Tammy, I, um...
-

1:12:37.062 --> 1:12:40.565
I prayed on it. And, um...

1:12:41.649 --> 1:12:42.650
What?

1:12:43.109 --> 1:12:45.862
You know,
maybe I've been a better builder

1:12:45.945 --> 1:12:47.697
than I've been a husband.

1:12:50.533 --> 1:12:52.327
-Yeah.
-Yes.

1:12:52.494 --> 1:12:54.954
But I know for certain

1:12:55.705 --> 1:12:59.084
that you are
the only woman on Earth

1:13:02.295 --> 1:13:05.006
-Oh, honey.

1:13:05.715 --> 1:13:07.801
It makes me so happy
that you're saying that.

1:13:08.009 --> 1:13:10.804
Tammy.
-Baby.

1:13:11.137 --> 1:13:13.723
-I'm sorry.

1:13:14.724 --> 1:13:18.394
-Oh...

1:13:19.729 --> 1:13:21.648
You really hurt me.

1:13:22.315 --> 1:13:23.817
I know, Jim.

1:13:25.443 --> 1:13:27.278
And I think you have to apologize.

1:13:27.737 --> 1:13:31.032
I'm sorry. Oh, I am so sorry, Jim.

1:13:31.616 --> 1:13:33.034
To the partners.

1:13:34.202 --> 1:13:37.163
-Mm?
-On air.

1:13:39.165 --> 1:13:40.208
Today.

1:13:43.336 --> 1:13:44.379
Oh.

1:13:45.630 --> 1:13:50.802
I learned the best
lesson in my whole life

1:13:50.969 --> 1:13:54.097
because of something terrible that I did

1:13:54.264 --> 1:13:56.015
that I cannot take back.

1:13:57.475 --> 1:14:00.186
I learned how much I love my husband,

1:14:00.353 --> 1:14:02.897
how much I care for my husband.

1:14:04.065 --> 1:14:06.151
And I learned a lesson of loneliness

1:14:06.317 --> 1:14:08.653
such as I never experienced
in my whole life.

1:14:12.240 --> 1:14:15.076
All of a sudden, I realized

1:14:15.285 --> 1:14:18.288
that there was a lot more to marriage

1:14:20.957 --> 1:14:22.458
-

1:14:22.542 --> 1:14:24.627
-WOMAN: We're with you, Tammy!
-

1:14:25.128 --> 1:14:27.088
WOMAN 2: PTL.
MAN: PTL.

1:14:27.255 --> 1:14:30.216
-How can I help you?
-WOMAN 3: Ah. Bless you.

1:14:35.722 --> 1:14:38.933
JIM: Because of our satellite,
from this moment on,

1:14:39.100 --> 1:14:44.272
the PTL Television Network
plans to broadcast 24 hours a day

1:14:44.439 --> 1:14:46.774
till the second coming of Christ.

1:14:46.941 --> 1:14:50.570
Jesus keeps on
takin' me higher and higher

1:14:50.737 --> 1:14:53.740
SINGERS: Higher and higher
Higher and higher

1:14:54.282 --> 1:14:57.869
Jesus keeps on takin' me
higher and higher

1:14:58.036 --> 1:15:01.623
SINGERS: Higher and higher
Higher and higher

1:15:01.998 --> 1:15:03.333
-Hi, everybody!
-

1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:06.794
God has a fixed law of giving.

1:15:06.961 --> 1:15:08.296
He gives me a shove
Yeah

1:15:08.379 --> 1:15:09.464
JIM: If you're not giving,

1:15:09.631 --> 1:15:13.468
you cannot expect to have
abundancy coming back to you.

1:15:13.551 --> 1:15:15.220
-If you aren't giving,

1:15:15.303 --> 1:15:17.513
you're gonna have a harvest of misery!

1:15:17.597 --> 1:15:19.015
-You're gonna have

1:15:19.098 --> 1:15:20.308
-a harvest of pain!
-PTL.

1:15:20.391 --> 1:15:23.102
You're gonna have a harvest of sickness!

1:15:23.269 --> 1:15:24.395
If you can't go to Jerusalem,

1:15:24.562 --> 1:15:26.898
you could come to Heritage
and you could go to the Upper Room.

1:15:27.065 --> 1:15:29.442
Exactly what you could see in Jerusalem.

1:15:29.609 --> 1:15:31.402
Except you don't have to get on a plane.

1:15:31.569 --> 1:15:33.029
You know, if everyone watching

1:15:33.112 --> 1:15:35.448
could double their pledge
just for one month...

1:15:35.615 --> 1:15:38.409
If you haven't sent your pledge
for $15 a month,

1:15:38.576 --> 1:15:42.372
do it now and I want to send you
Susie Moppet puppets.

1:15:42.538 --> 1:15:45.583
God becomes your source when you give

1:15:46.125 --> 1:15:48.753
and you sow in his kingdom.

1:15:48.920 --> 1:15:50.004
It works.

1:15:50.171 --> 1:15:52.382
SINGERS: Higher, higher, higher

1:15:53.383 --> 1:15:54.384
Whoo

1:15:55.343 --> 1:15:56.970
Wow

1:15:57.303 --> 1:15:58.304
Whoo

1:15:58.429 --> 1:16:01.933
The PTL TV network is
carrying out a master plan...

1:16:02.100 --> 1:16:03.726
opening centers all across the country

1:16:03.893 --> 1:16:06.521
to provide food, clothing, furniture,
and job bank centers.

1:16:06.604 --> 1:16:09.649
TAMMY: Jesus keeps on
leadin' me higher and higher

1:16:14.529 --> 1:16:17.532
SINGERS: Higher, higher
Higher, higher

1:16:17.699 --> 1:16:18.741
-Hi, everybody.
-

1:16:18.992 --> 1:16:21.953
SINGERS: Higher, higher
Higher, higher

1:16:22.662 --> 1:16:25.206
Higher, higher
Whoo

1:16:25.373 --> 1:16:28.251
Higher, higher, higher
Whoo

1:16:28.334 --> 1:16:30.753
Jesus keeps on
leadin' me higher and higher

1:16:30.837 --> 1:16:31.838
JIM: I've seen the rich

1:16:32.130 --> 1:16:34.090
and I've seen people with little

1:16:34.257 --> 1:16:36.175
who are more blessed

1:16:36.342 --> 1:16:39.470
than the millionaires that I've known
who are worried sick

1:16:39.595 --> 1:16:41.389
'cause the stock market
doesn't know what it's doing!

1:16:41.472 --> 1:16:42.890
It's going up, it's going down!

1:16:43.057 --> 1:16:45.768
But people who have sown seed
in the word of God,

1:16:45.935 --> 1:16:47.895
their stock is always up!

1:16:48.062 --> 1:16:50.815
Higher and higher

1:16:50.898 --> 1:16:52.483
-

1:16:57.113 --> 1:16:58.656
JIM: That's why we chose this plot.

1:16:58.823 --> 1:16:59.991
And with the help of your investment,

1:17:00.074 --> 1:17:02.618
we could build a shopping complex
around the hotel

1:17:02.785 --> 1:17:04.871
and then we're going to have a trolley.

1:17:04.954 --> 1:17:05.955
JERRY: Mm.

1:17:06.039 --> 1:17:08.333
It's gonna wrap around the whole place,

1:17:08.499 --> 1:17:12.211
making stops at everywhere there
at Heritage Island, the Heritage Grand,

1:17:12.295 --> 1:17:17.550
and then here
at what is going to be our coliseum.

1:17:17.717 --> 1:17:18.926
We're gonna have a coliseum.

1:17:19.010 --> 1:17:20.720
-JERRY: Coliseum.
- Yes.

1:17:20.803 --> 1:17:23.348
You planning on sacrificing Christians?

1:17:24.140 --> 1:17:26.851
Oh, no. No.

1:17:27.143 --> 1:17:30.813
Oh, Jerry, no.
We rise again in our coliseum.

1:17:30.980 --> 1:17:33.566
This is, uh, gonna be
Christian rock concerts.

1:17:33.733 --> 1:17:35.318
Something for the kids.

1:17:35.485 --> 1:17:39.280
I really wish you wouldn't
encourage these blasphemers.

1:17:42.450 --> 1:17:45.286
-Isn't it beautiful?
-It really is. Mm-hmm.

1:17:46.037 --> 1:17:48.206
The trees, the oxygen is...

1:17:48.373 --> 1:17:50.291
Are you cold?

1:17:50.458 --> 1:17:52.377
Are you...

1:17:52.543 --> 1:17:55.046
Of course you're not cold.

1:17:55.129 --> 1:17:57.882
-Sorry.
- Oh, I'm super.

1:18:03.805 --> 1:18:04.931
JIM: So, what do you think, Reverend?

1:18:05.014 --> 1:18:07.767
We would be tickled pink
to have your support.

1:18:07.934 --> 1:18:09.060
-Yes?

1:18:09.143 --> 1:18:11.312
JERRY: The coalition
that we delivered to Reagan,

1:18:11.479 --> 1:18:13.481
Vice President Bush...

1:18:13.648 --> 1:18:16.609
well, he's counting on us
doing the same thing for him in '88.

1:18:17.235 --> 1:18:18.236
Um...

1:18:19.612 --> 1:18:22.240
You know that Pat called me

1:18:22.407 --> 1:18:26.035
and he told me that he's thinking
about making a bid for President.

1:18:26.202 --> 1:18:28.287
Pat Robertson's a good man.

1:18:28.454 --> 1:18:30.957
But if he runs,
he'll peel away vital Republican votes.

1:18:32.291 --> 1:18:33.918
We're in a fight here, Jim.

1:18:34.585 --> 1:18:38.798
This gay cancer is affecting our country,
our families.

1:18:39.173 --> 1:18:41.300
Republicans can't win without us.

1:18:42.844 --> 1:18:45.012
You need to understand
how powerful we are

1:18:45.096 --> 1:18:47.557
in this fight for our nation's soul.

1:18:48.015 --> 1:18:49.308
JIM: Mm.

1:18:49.642 --> 1:18:52.437
We should just stay out of it
and keep politics out of the church.

1:18:52.520 --> 1:18:53.688
Too much on the line.

1:18:55.565 --> 1:19:00.736
Democrats are already trying to strip away
our churches' tax exempt status.

1:19:02.905 --> 1:19:06.617
Oh, this time, we'll keep
the evangelicals in the tent.

1:19:08.494 --> 1:19:09.912
When's lunch?

1:19:10.079 --> 1:19:11.247
TAMMY: Well, hello, everyone,

1:19:11.330 --> 1:19:13.124
it's just so nice
to have you here with us.

1:19:13.291 --> 1:19:17.170
We have an experience today
that really is touching to me.

1:19:17.253 --> 1:19:19.672
Right here on my right,
I have a young man named Steve Pieters,

1:19:19.755 --> 1:19:21.799
and I'd like to introduce you to Steve.

1:19:21.966 --> 1:19:24.594
Steve is a patient of AIDS

1:19:24.677 --> 1:19:28.222
and he's so generously allowed us
to talk to him today.

1:19:28.431 --> 1:19:31.434
He is presently taking chemotherapy
and is unable to travel.

1:19:31.517 --> 1:19:35.480
So, we have a satellite hookup
live from LA.

1:19:35.646 --> 1:19:38.316
-Hi, Tammy.

1:19:38.399 --> 1:19:40.359
We're so glad to see you.

1:19:41.110 --> 1:19:42.737
I'm so happy I could be here.

1:19:42.904 --> 1:19:45.281
Okay, Steve.
At what time in your life

1:19:45.364 --> 1:19:47.867
did you feel like you were different?

1:19:47.950 --> 1:19:51.120
Did you feel like maybe you weren't
like some of the other guys?

1:19:51.287 --> 1:19:54.749
I realized I was gay
when I was about 11 or 12.

1:19:55.791 --> 1:19:59.170
I talked with a pastor in the church
where I grew up

1:19:59.253 --> 1:20:01.506
and, um, he was freaked out.

1:20:01.589 --> 1:20:02.632
Mm.

1:20:02.715 --> 1:20:06.385
He told me, "Don't tell anybody."

1:20:06.552 --> 1:20:09.972
Never tell anybody anything about it

1:20:10.139 --> 1:20:11.182
and it will go away,

1:20:12.225 --> 1:20:14.810
but it didn't go away.

1:20:14.894 --> 1:20:15.937
Okay, I have another question.

1:20:16.020 --> 1:20:17.688
JERRY: So, the satellite
is directly above us?

1:20:17.772 --> 1:20:19.649
JIM: Yes, it orbits us.

1:20:19.815 --> 1:20:23.402
That's how we're able to reach
so many folks just simultaneously.

1:20:23.569 --> 1:20:25.363
Let me ask you, Jerry,
what's your viewership

1:20:25.446 --> 1:20:26.948
over at Liberty Broadcasting?

1:20:27.114 --> 1:20:31.035
Oh, well, I'm proud to say
that we reach three million viewers a day.

1:20:31.118 --> 1:20:35.331
My goodness. Praise God.
That's just wonderful.

1:20:36.707 --> 1:20:38.000
And you?

1:20:38.167 --> 1:20:41.504
Well, we here at PTL,
we reach 20 million viewers a day

1:20:42.129 --> 1:20:46.050
in 56 countries
just because of that miracle

1:20:46.133 --> 1:20:48.010
-up there in the sky.
-

1:20:48.094 --> 1:20:50.221
Oh, let's see who Tammy's talking to.

1:20:50.304 --> 1:20:51.430
TAMMY: And, Steve,
because of this feeling,

1:20:51.514 --> 1:20:52.640
did you try to make friends with girls?

1:20:52.723 --> 1:20:55.309
And did you try to be
around girls and everything

1:20:55.476 --> 1:20:56.644
so no one would think anything?

1:20:56.811 --> 1:20:58.646
Oh, sure, I dated girls.

1:20:58.813 --> 1:21:02.066
I tried to "program" myself to be straight

1:21:02.692 --> 1:21:04.485
and it never worked.

1:21:04.569 --> 1:21:06.070
TAMMY: So, what made you feel...

1:21:06.153 --> 1:21:07.572
And what's this, Jim?

1:21:07.655 --> 1:21:09.156
TAMMY: ...like there was
no way for you to be straight?

1:21:09.240 --> 1:21:10.741
I don't know.

1:21:10.908 --> 1:21:13.035
-This is not...
-It was from meeting

1:21:13.119 --> 1:21:16.706
other gay people who were happy
with the way they were

1:21:16.872 --> 1:21:19.709
that made me realize
I could be happy with the way I am.

1:21:19.875 --> 1:21:21.836
-Now, I find this problematic.
-

1:21:21.919 --> 1:21:23.713
Yes. Well, you know Tammy,

1:21:23.796 --> 1:21:25.923
she... she connects in her own way and...

1:21:26.090 --> 1:21:28.426
Okay, Steve. What did you feel

1:21:28.593 --> 1:21:32.305
when you first heard the word AIDS?

1:21:32.471 --> 1:21:34.181
Was it just a word to you, Steve?

1:21:34.390 --> 1:21:38.144
Well, yes. Why would it hurt me?
I was a good Christian pastor.

1:21:38.311 --> 1:21:40.146
I... I can't look at this.

1:21:40.229 --> 1:21:41.606
JIM: No.

1:21:41.689 --> 1:21:43.691
She must have programmed it
last minute or...

1:21:43.774 --> 1:21:44.859
You need to get her under control.

1:21:44.942 --> 1:21:46.652
No, no. Let me help.

1:21:47.528 --> 1:21:50.531
Believe you me,
I will be having words with her.

1:21:50.615 --> 1:21:51.616
-She's been acting very...
-Jim.

1:21:51.699 --> 1:21:52.700
Yes?

1:21:52.783 --> 1:21:54.201
We have our differences.

1:21:55.703 --> 1:21:58.205
People forget sometimes
a pastor needs a pastor.

1:21:58.664 --> 1:22:00.041
As Jesus says in Mark 5...

1:22:00.916 --> 1:22:02.335
Reach out.

1:22:02.501 --> 1:22:03.586
Yes.

1:22:05.254 --> 1:22:06.714
What happened
when you told your mom and dad

1:22:06.797 --> 1:22:07.923
that you were feeling this way?

1:22:08.007 --> 1:22:10.760
-Well, my mother cried.
-Uh-huh.

1:22:10.926 --> 1:22:13.512
And my father held my hand

1:22:13.679 --> 1:22:16.599
and told me that I was his son,
no matter what.

1:22:16.974 --> 1:22:19.060
Ah, thank God.

1:22:19.268 --> 1:22:22.480
You know,
thank God for a mom and dad

1:22:22.563 --> 1:22:24.940
who will stand with a young person.

1:22:25.107 --> 1:22:26.359
I think that's so important

1:22:26.442 --> 1:22:29.362
because no matter what happens
to a young person in their lives,

1:22:29.445 --> 1:22:32.156
they're still your boy,
they're still your girl

1:22:32.323 --> 1:22:33.449
no matter what happens in their life.

1:22:33.532 --> 1:22:35.076
And I think it's very important

1:22:35.242 --> 1:22:38.454
that we as mom and dads
love through anything.

1:22:38.621 --> 1:22:40.539
And that's the way with Jesus, you know?

1:22:40.706 --> 1:22:42.833
Jesus loves us through anything.

1:22:43.000 --> 1:22:44.960
Jesus loves me just the way I am.

1:22:45.127 --> 1:22:47.797
Jesus loves the way that I love.

1:22:48.589 --> 1:22:50.758
And have you found it to be true

1:22:50.925 --> 1:22:52.343
that people wanna stay away

1:22:52.510 --> 1:22:55.471
and that they're afraid to be
in the same room as you

1:22:55.680 --> 1:22:57.640
and breathe the same air that you breathe?

1:22:58.516 --> 1:22:59.517
Yes, Tammy.

1:23:00.393 --> 1:23:02.728
And how sad is that?

1:23:03.270 --> 1:23:05.189
That we as Christians

1:23:05.648 --> 1:23:08.567
who are supposed to love everyone

1:23:09.360 --> 1:23:12.822
are afraid so badly of an AIDS patient

1:23:13.698 --> 1:23:15.658
that we will not go up to them

1:23:15.825 --> 1:23:17.910
and put our arm around them

1:23:18.077 --> 1:23:20.621
and tell them that we care?

1:23:26.919 --> 1:23:28.921
This is an emotional interview for me.

1:23:29.004 --> 1:23:30.047
I just met Steve

1:23:30.131 --> 1:23:32.675
and it's like meeting him in person
for the first time.

1:23:32.842 --> 1:23:34.260
I wanna put my arm around you.

1:23:34.427 --> 1:23:36.262
And I wanna put my arms around you,
Tammy Faye.

1:23:39.056 --> 1:23:41.475
-

1:23:42.059 --> 1:23:43.853
WOMAN: PTL.
MAN: PTL.

1:23:45.354 --> 1:23:46.689
WOMAN: That's very good. Yes.

1:23:48.649 --> 1:23:50.192
Every time she calls, she screams,

1:23:50.276 --> 1:23:51.694
"Jim and his buddy had sex on me."

1:23:51.777 --> 1:23:53.154
-FLETCHER: Okay. Shh.
-"Now, I'm gonna kill myself.

1:23:53.237 --> 1:23:55.573
"Jim Bakker'll have my
gosh darn blood on his hands."

1:23:55.656 --> 1:23:56.657
FLETCHER: Now...

1:23:56.741 --> 1:23:57.867
WOMAN 2: Never heard
so many curse words.

1:23:57.950 --> 1:23:58.993
Not even from my brother Pete.

1:23:59.076 --> 1:24:00.077
FLETCHER: Right.

1:24:00.161 --> 1:24:01.704
-Did a caller upset you, dear?
-FLETCHER: Tammy...

1:24:01.787 --> 1:24:02.788
Yes.

1:24:02.872 --> 1:24:04.999
Oh, I'm so sorry.
You know, when we do shows like this,

1:24:05.082 --> 1:24:08.169
really, we're challenging Christians
to open their hearts.

1:24:08.335 --> 1:24:10.629
-And some don't take it that well.
-Tammy, I will handle this.

1:24:10.713 --> 1:24:12.131
Oh, no, I have this, Richard.

1:24:12.214 --> 1:24:14.633
It wasn't about the AIDS man.
It was about Jim.

1:24:15.176 --> 1:24:17.678
She's called before.
We all call her "The Shrieker."

1:24:17.803 --> 1:24:19.930
She says Jim and his buddy
had sex on her.

1:24:20.014 --> 1:24:21.557
Tammy, you're needed on stage four.

1:24:21.640 --> 1:24:24.268
Gosh, we've been having
these pranks for a long time.

1:24:24.351 --> 1:24:26.645
And some people,
they're just hurting so bad

1:24:26.812 --> 1:24:29.148
and we just need to love them.

1:24:29.315 --> 1:24:31.984
Anyway, Jim doesn't have that in him.
Believe me.

1:24:33.277 --> 1:24:35.446
I know him better than anyone.

1:24:58.344 --> 1:24:59.887
Join the PTL Club,

1:24:59.970 --> 1:25:02.264
and Tammy wants to send you
a copy of her book...

1:25:02.807 --> 1:25:06.060
about how to overcome fear.

1:25:06.685 --> 1:25:09.396
If you haven't
sent in your pledge...

1:25:09.939 --> 1:25:12.149
$15, that is all, $15 a month,

1:25:12.233 --> 1:25:14.026
it'll change your life

1:25:15.069 --> 1:25:17.071
and, uh, we could all use
a little bit of that.

1:25:17.530 --> 1:25:19.949
So, Tammy, I think you oughta
sing a song for us.

1:25:20.115 --> 1:25:22.701
Oh, I'm back here
looking at the boat, Jim.

1:25:22.868 --> 1:25:24.078
Isn't this a magnificent thing?

1:25:24.161 --> 1:25:25.162
JIM: Yes.

1:25:25.496 --> 1:25:26.580
Right here in our beach.

1:25:26.747 --> 1:25:28.374
JIM: Looks brand new, I bet.

1:25:29.250 --> 1:25:30.251
One of the local boat companies

1:25:30.334 --> 1:25:31.961
-loaned it to us, I bet.
-I'm gonna take my shoes off.

1:25:32.044 --> 1:25:33.963
I'm gonna wade in the water.

1:25:35.047 --> 1:25:37.716
JIM: I don't think
that boat's ever seen water.

1:25:38.300 --> 1:25:40.177
Oh, it's fake. That's...

1:25:41.387 --> 1:25:42.596
That's why.

1:25:44.723 --> 1:25:46.433
"That's why" what, Tam?

1:25:48.686 --> 1:25:50.312
TAMMY: That's why I can't hear Him.

1:25:50.396 --> 1:25:51.438
JIM: Oh.

1:25:52.773 --> 1:25:55.109
How can I hear Him when the sky is fake?

1:25:56.235 --> 1:25:57.653
JIM: You want to stand up, honey?

1:25:57.736 --> 1:25:59.238
We're trying to do a TV show here, baby.

1:25:59.321 --> 1:26:00.531
You wanna come give me some help?

1:26:01.699 --> 1:26:03.117
No? Well...

1:26:06.871 --> 1:26:09.790
I guess it's a good time
as any to work on the tan.

1:26:12.459 --> 1:26:15.421
Well, if Tammy's not going to sing,
I guess I am.

1:26:15.504 --> 1:26:16.505
Oh, we're blest

1:26:16.589 --> 1:26:17.756
We're blest, we're blest

1:26:20.509 --> 1:26:21.927
JIM: We just got her home.

1:26:22.303 --> 1:26:24.221
She's doing okay, she's fine.

1:26:24.388 --> 1:26:28.434
No, yeah. We'll be taking her
to the Betty Ford Center in the morning.

1:26:28.601 --> 1:26:32.438
She just needs to rest.
No shows for a while.

1:26:32.938 --> 1:26:35.357
What's happening
with the other thing?

1:26:37.067 --> 1:26:40.529
Can I just say
I love you so much?

1:26:40.863 --> 1:26:42.781
-I love you.

1:26:42.948 --> 1:26:46.994
My friends are gonna be so excited
when I tell them that I met you.

1:26:54.001 --> 1:26:55.085
RACHEL: Tammy?

1:26:55.669 --> 1:26:58.422
You had enough drugs in your system
to kill a truck driver.

1:26:59.465 --> 1:27:00.466
I did?

1:27:00.633 --> 1:27:02.468
The doctor told us
if you'd waited a day longer,

1:27:02.635 --> 1:27:04.345
you would have had brain damage.

1:27:04.553 --> 1:27:06.263
You could have died.

1:27:06.972 --> 1:27:08.766
You can't take all those pills, honey.

1:27:08.849 --> 1:27:09.850
They're addictive.

1:27:09.934 --> 1:27:11.936
I didn't know that. I'll stop.

1:27:12.102 --> 1:27:14.146
The doctors didn't tell me that.

1:27:14.313 --> 1:27:16.315
I'm not a drug addict.

1:27:17.483 --> 1:27:19.318
I'm only addicted to Diet Coke.

1:27:20.361 --> 1:27:22.696
You have to stay right here.

1:27:24.239 --> 1:27:25.658
God doesn't want you yet.

1:27:26.700 --> 1:27:28.619
I have always prayed to Him

1:27:28.786 --> 1:27:32.331
that He would allow you to save the souls
that I wasn't able to.

1:27:33.749 --> 1:27:35.376
And He has.

1:27:36.126 --> 1:27:37.127
You do.

1:27:38.420 --> 1:27:41.799
So, you have to stay right here.

1:27:43.634 --> 1:27:44.760
Okay?

1:27:45.844 --> 1:27:47.554
Okay, Mom.

1:28:24.258 --> 1:28:25.259
JIM: Tammy.

1:28:25.926 --> 1:28:28.053
Oh. Hi, Jim.

1:28:30.639 --> 1:28:33.475
The Devil's coming for me, Tammy.

1:28:34.351 --> 1:28:37.271
Can we talk about Satan later?

1:28:37.438 --> 1:28:39.314
You know,
I'm trying to feel like myself again.

1:28:39.481 --> 1:28:41.150
JIM: There was a woman...

1:28:44.737 --> 1:28:46.238
Fletcher set it up

1:28:46.947 --> 1:28:51.994
after you did what you did with Gary.

1:28:52.703 --> 1:28:56.415
I did it to prove something to myself,
I think. I... I don't know.

1:28:57.416 --> 1:28:59.043
I hated it.

1:29:01.879 --> 1:29:05.049
I ended up just crying
in the bathroom.

1:29:11.847 --> 1:29:13.140
I fell...

1:29:14.850 --> 1:29:16.477
a long way.

1:29:18.228 --> 1:29:19.396
I'm so sorry.

1:29:24.318 --> 1:29:26.278
Say something.

1:29:29.823 --> 1:29:31.742
I've been hurting so bad, Jim.

1:29:32.659 --> 1:29:34.119
For years.

1:29:36.455 --> 1:29:39.249
And there's never any release
to the pain.

1:29:40.751 --> 1:29:43.420
There's never anything
to make it stop hurting.

1:29:44.880 --> 1:29:47.174
And when I get up in the morning,

1:29:48.133 --> 1:29:50.135
I feel like I'm just gonna throw up...

1:29:51.386 --> 1:29:54.139
and throw up, and throw up.

1:29:56.058 --> 1:29:59.728
And I have to self-talk myself,
"You can make it, Tammy.

1:29:59.895 --> 1:30:01.688
"You can make it.

1:30:01.772 --> 1:30:03.982
"Don't give up."

1:30:08.570 --> 1:30:10.948
Damn it, Jim!

1:30:12.991 --> 1:30:17.955
I'm so sick from my faith in you!

1:30:20.874 --> 1:30:23.377
Well, I'm sick of you, too.

1:30:25.921 --> 1:30:29.675
You try being married to Tammy Faye.

1:30:29.842 --> 1:30:33.887
All I've been doing is trying
to keep our marriage together,

1:30:34.054 --> 1:30:37.266
keep the ministry together,
working night and day

1:30:37.432 --> 1:30:40.435
while you're just buying minks

1:30:40.602 --> 1:30:42.855
and drinking soda pop

1:30:43.021 --> 1:30:47.151
and cheating on me with that ape!

1:30:51.321 --> 1:30:53.574
You used to take care of me, Tammy.

1:30:54.074 --> 1:30:55.576
You stopped taking care of me.

1:30:55.742 --> 1:30:58.120
I don't wanna take care of you, Jim.

1:30:58.287 --> 1:31:00.205
I don't wanna be your mother.

1:31:00.706 --> 1:31:03.375
A woman needs a man in a relationship!

1:31:03.584 --> 1:31:05.752
-I am a man!
-You're a boy.

1:31:05.919 --> 1:31:07.504
I built all of this.
I built you an empire.

1:31:07.671 --> 1:31:09.631
You built you an empire.

1:31:09.798 --> 1:31:12.551
No man could ever give you enough.

1:31:12.718 --> 1:31:15.012
You're a bottomless pit.

1:31:15.637 --> 1:31:17.973
And you keep on asking me for more

1:31:18.140 --> 1:31:23.228
with that whiny, grating Betty Boop voice!

1:31:39.328 --> 1:31:40.954
I thought you liked Betty Boop.

1:31:44.458 --> 1:31:45.751
I'm sorry.

1:31:46.710 --> 1:31:48.921
I'm so sorry, Tammy.

1:31:49.087 --> 1:31:50.422
Me, too, Jim.

1:31:51.298 --> 1:31:52.507
Um...

1:31:55.093 --> 1:31:59.765
There's another thing.
The woman...

1:32:00.474 --> 1:32:05.270
I gave her money to stay quiet,
but she didn't.

1:32:05.604 --> 1:32:06.605
And, um...

1:32:06.688 --> 1:32:08.941
And the money came from PTL donors.

1:32:09.107 --> 1:32:10.108
Jim.

1:32:10.192 --> 1:32:11.902
And Charles Shepard has the story
from The Observer.

1:32:11.985 --> 1:32:13.070
And he's gonna print it tomorrow.

1:32:13.153 --> 1:32:15.405
Oh, my God.

1:32:19.409 --> 1:32:21.995
-JIM: I just... I know...
-Jim. Oh, my God.

1:32:24.414 --> 1:32:26.124
I destroyed everything.

1:32:27.751 --> 1:32:29.503
Our life's work, Jim.

1:32:29.670 --> 1:32:30.837
I know.

1:32:31.964 --> 1:32:33.382
Tammy.

1:32:34.758 --> 1:32:37.636
Tam, my sweetheart,

1:32:39.137 --> 1:32:41.473
if anyone falls, it's gonna be me.

1:32:42.432 --> 1:32:45.727
You can let me be the man
that I was meant to be for you.

1:32:46.979 --> 1:32:49.106
You don't know anything.

1:32:52.359 --> 1:32:53.610
Oh, they're here.

1:32:53.777 --> 1:32:54.820
Who's that?

1:32:54.987 --> 1:32:56.530
It's all right.

1:32:58.031 --> 1:32:59.992
These are the men
that are gonna help me fix this.

1:33:00.534 --> 1:33:01.994
Oh, no, Jim.

1:33:02.160 --> 1:33:04.746
-No, no.
-Reverend. Thank you so much.

1:33:04.830 --> 1:33:06.123
-Thank you so much for coming.
-JERRY: Jim.

1:33:06.623 --> 1:33:09.001
Oh, it's love that carried me here today.

1:33:09.209 --> 1:33:11.253
God bless you.
JERRY: Tammy Faye.

1:33:11.753 --> 1:33:12.921
Jerry.

1:33:13.088 --> 1:33:15.048
JIM: Come in, please.
Please come in. Welcome.

1:33:15.132 --> 1:33:16.883
Thank you.
Thank you for coming, fellas.

1:33:17.050 --> 1:33:18.218
All right.

1:33:18.969 --> 1:33:20.637
Well, here we are.

1:33:20.804 --> 1:33:23.932
JERRY: We think it's best
that we create a distance

1:33:24.016 --> 1:33:26.018
between you and the ministry.

1:33:26.184 --> 1:33:27.561
It'll only be for a couple of weeks.

1:33:28.186 --> 1:33:31.023
Then, gradually,
we'll bring you back on the network

1:33:31.732 --> 1:33:33.734
after all this unpleasantness
settles down.

1:33:33.900 --> 1:33:37.070
Jerry, you're a Baptist.
You know, you're not a charismatic.

1:33:37.237 --> 1:33:38.947
And our audience won't like that.

1:33:39.114 --> 1:33:40.532
-Right, Jim?
-Audience?

1:33:41.533 --> 1:33:43.118
I thought they were parishioners.

1:33:43.285 --> 1:33:44.786
They are.

1:33:44.953 --> 1:33:47.164
They're our partners.
We call them partners.

1:33:47.247 --> 1:33:48.457
JERRY: Mm.

1:33:48.540 --> 1:33:50.292
20 million souls a day

1:33:50.417 --> 1:33:53.628
touched by The Word.
Thanks to PTL.

1:33:53.795 --> 1:33:54.921
JIM AND TAMMY: Mm.

1:33:55.047 --> 1:33:56.798
JERRY: You go back there
right away, and...

1:33:58.300 --> 1:33:59.718
Well, bless your hearts.

1:33:59.801 --> 1:34:02.637
Look at the two of you right now,
so very pitiful.

1:34:03.764 --> 1:34:06.183
They see you,
and they'll change the channel.

1:34:08.018 --> 1:34:09.019
Jim,

1:34:09.561 --> 1:34:11.772
all those souls you won

1:34:13.065 --> 1:34:14.983
for Jesus...

1:34:16.610 --> 1:34:18.195
I'm here for you.

1:34:18.820 --> 1:34:20.989
JIM: Thank you, Reverend.
JERRY: Mm.

1:34:24.701 --> 1:34:27.079
Just make sure
you take care of our partners.

1:34:28.497 --> 1:34:30.457
That is the only thing that matters now.

1:34:40.842 --> 1:34:42.803
ANNOUNCER: You're watching PTL,

1:34:42.886 --> 1:34:44.846
The Inspirational Network.

1:34:47.766 --> 1:34:49.726
Tammy and I are so very glad

1:34:49.893 --> 1:34:54.398
that we've been granted the opportunity
to talk with you today,

1:34:54.564 --> 1:34:55.982
and, um...

1:34:56.149 --> 1:34:57.567
Say hello.

1:34:57.734 --> 1:34:59.277
Hello, everybody.

1:34:59.778 --> 1:35:01.029
And...

1:35:01.780 --> 1:35:03.949
we want to say to you

1:35:04.116 --> 1:35:09.121
that we are so very, very sorry.

1:35:09.287 --> 1:35:12.499
And to thank the people
who are standing with us all over,

1:35:12.666 --> 1:35:15.293
saying, "Jim, we do forgive you.

1:35:15.460 --> 1:35:19.131
"We forgive Jim and Tammy
of all of their sins."

1:35:19.297 --> 1:35:23.135
And we're so thankful
that God has forgiven us.

1:35:23.301 --> 1:35:27.764
We don't know what the future holds,
but I believe, Tammy.

1:35:27.931 --> 1:35:30.100
'Cause the God I know is still God.

1:35:30.267 --> 1:35:33.061
I believe that the sun will shine again.

1:35:33.228 --> 1:35:34.563
Oh, I do, too, Jim.

1:35:34.729 --> 1:35:36.690
Do you wanna sing it?
Can you do it?

1:35:36.857 --> 1:35:38.567
-I sure will.
-All right.

1:35:38.733 --> 1:35:42.070
All right, Tammy Faye is
going to sing a song for us.

1:35:43.989 --> 1:35:47.117
TAMMY: Well, maybe you're hurting,
and you need this song today, too.

1:35:47.284 --> 1:35:50.704
So I'll sing it for both of us, okay?

1:35:50.871 --> 1:35:55.292
The sun will shine again

1:35:56.084 --> 1:36:02.299
Now, if you are facing a mountain so high

1:36:02.466 --> 1:36:08.555
That just won't move away

1:36:09.723 --> 1:36:13.268
JERRY: We've heard
about your sinful behavior.

1:36:13.727 --> 1:36:18.023
If you tell us what we need to know
about Jim Bakker,

1:36:19.024 --> 1:36:20.484
we can protect you.

1:36:21.193 --> 1:36:24.654
Oh-ho, listen, my brother

1:36:24.821 --> 1:36:27.699
We don't want them destitute.

1:36:27.866 --> 1:36:29.868
They're children of God.

1:36:30.535 --> 1:36:31.828
We want to make sure

1:36:31.912 --> 1:36:35.582
we don't leave them stranded
in the desert.

1:36:44.090 --> 1:36:46.384
Write it down, what you make,

1:36:46.468 --> 1:36:48.762
what you need, every little thing.

1:36:48.929 --> 1:36:54.142
While you're in your time of healing,
he wants you to be safe and provided for.

1:36:54.309 --> 1:36:56.811
I told him how fragile you are.

1:36:56.978 --> 1:37:00.357
He wants to help.
He told me so himself.

1:37:02.192 --> 1:37:04.152
JIM: You wanna start us off, honey?

1:37:06.988 --> 1:37:08.990
-What should I write, Jim?
-JIM: Start with everything.

1:37:09.157 --> 1:37:10.784
Start with what you need for clothes.

1:37:10.951 --> 1:37:12.410
What's your salary, Jim?

1:37:12.577 --> 1:37:15.080
JIM: One second.
I'll try calling Jerry again.

1:37:15.247 --> 1:37:18.458
He hasn't returned any of my calls.

1:37:18.792 --> 1:37:22.003
The other side whose storm

1:37:22.170 --> 1:37:25.590
Is going to end

1:37:26.675 --> 1:37:30.136
Well, your midnight's almost over

1:37:30.220 --> 1:37:32.597
-"Jim's salary for a lifetime

1:37:32.681 --> 1:37:34.349
"at 300,000 per year.

1:37:34.516 --> 1:37:38.311
"Tammy's salary for a lifetime
at 100,000 a year.

1:37:38.478 --> 1:37:40.564
"Secretary for one year. Phone bill.

1:37:40.730 --> 1:37:44.317
"House on the lake. Security.
Personal maid."

1:37:47.028 --> 1:37:49.823
I don't see the repentance there.

1:37:51.408 --> 1:37:55.120
I see the greed.
I see the self-centeredness.

1:37:55.287 --> 1:37:59.207
I see the avarice that brought them down.

1:37:59.749 --> 1:38:02.544
Jim, I have sat across the table

1:38:02.711 --> 1:38:06.298
from men who have told me
about your homosexual advances.

1:38:07.215 --> 1:38:11.970
And since then,
I have learned of fiscal irregularities.

1:38:12.137 --> 1:38:14.014
It would be a disservice to God, Jim...

1:38:14.097 --> 1:38:15.473
It's all over.

1:38:15.640 --> 1:38:18.727
...and to the church at large
if I allowed you to come back.

1:38:18.893 --> 1:38:20.937
I've been had.

1:38:21.104 --> 1:38:25.150
How could you have trusted
people like that?

1:38:25.942 --> 1:38:29.863
You understand
that I can't allow you to stay here.

1:38:30.989 --> 1:38:35.243
Your home, and everything in it,
belongs to the ministry.

1:38:36.411 --> 1:38:38.955
Your midnight's almost over.

1:38:39.122 --> 1:38:43.668
And thank God,
the sun is going to shine again.

1:38:43.877 --> 1:38:45.962
Praise, praise in the name of the Lord.

1:38:46.129 --> 1:38:48.590
The charges being made
against you right now

1:38:48.757 --> 1:38:52.677
are, in effect, that you stole PTL blind.

1:38:52.844 --> 1:38:55.639
While PTL was suffering
through months after months

1:38:55.805 --> 1:38:58.224
of $2 million negative balances,

1:38:58.391 --> 1:39:00.143
you were paying yourself bonuses,

1:39:00.226 --> 1:39:01.895
-you were paying Tammy Faye bonuses.
-No.

1:39:01.978 --> 1:39:04.898
I don't know if you ever have
a positive balance in a ministry, Jim.

1:39:05.065 --> 1:39:06.983
I've never known anyone
to have a positive one.

1:39:07.150 --> 1:39:09.903
We're... We're always playing catch-up.

1:39:10.070 --> 1:39:11.321
NEWSCASTER 1:
Jim Bakker went on trial

1:39:11.446 --> 1:39:13.031
on charges of fraud today.

1:39:13.114 --> 1:39:14.449
The prosecution called Bakker,

1:39:14.532 --> 1:39:15.533
"A man corrupted
by love of money and luxury."

1:39:15.659 --> 1:39:16.743
The founder of
the now-bankrupt PTL ministry

1:39:16.826 --> 1:39:17.827
swindled followers

1:39:17.994 --> 1:39:20.330
out of millions of dollars
to support a lavish lifestyle.

1:39:20.413 --> 1:39:21.581
NEWSCASTER 2: One couple showed up

1:39:21.665 --> 1:39:22.666
in Jim and Tammy Faye masks.

1:39:22.749 --> 1:39:24.084
NEWSCASTER 3:
...couple million dollars in PTL cash

1:39:24.167 --> 1:39:25.168
for their personal use.

1:39:25.627 --> 1:39:27.962
TED: How much money
did you earn last year?

1:39:28.046 --> 1:39:32.300
Salary, bonuses, and dividends,
and royalties...

1:39:32.384 --> 1:39:33.593
No idea? You're starting...

1:39:33.677 --> 1:39:35.220
I don't have the exact figure.

1:39:35.303 --> 1:39:37.138
-TED: Not exactly.
-I honestly, honest...

1:39:37.305 --> 1:39:39.808
I do not know how much I make.
I never thought about it.

1:39:39.974 --> 1:39:42.227
-I really don't.

1:39:42.644 --> 1:39:44.104
NEWSCASTER:
To raise desperately needed cash,

1:39:44.270 --> 1:39:46.856
PTL is auctioning off
opulent personal items

1:39:47.023 --> 1:39:49.275
deposed Evangelists Jim and Tammy Bakker

1:39:49.359 --> 1:39:50.568
bought with church donations.

1:39:50.652 --> 1:39:52.570
They also brought new charges
of moral failure.

1:39:52.654 --> 1:39:54.072
NEWSCASTER 2: ...having sex
with Reverend Jim Bakker.

1:39:54.155 --> 1:39:55.156
NEWSCASTER 3: Jessica Hahn,

1:39:55.240 --> 1:39:58.785
Bakker personally directed
the payment of PTL hush money.

1:39:58.952 --> 1:40:00.662
We grieve for the impact
all of this has had

1:40:00.745 --> 1:40:02.539
upon the entire Christian community.

1:40:02.956 --> 1:40:06.501
TED: As for the homosexual advances
going back to 1956,

1:40:06.710 --> 1:40:08.878
-you're saying that's a lie.
-Yes. Yes.

1:40:09.045 --> 1:40:11.923
Yes, that's... that's... that's true.

1:40:12.006 --> 1:40:13.133
What are you saying?

1:40:13.216 --> 1:40:14.217
That's... That's a lie.

1:40:14.300 --> 1:40:16.803
Yes. Yes. And, you know,

1:40:16.970 --> 1:40:18.763
people need to know

1:40:18.930 --> 1:40:23.601
that God loves homosexuals.

1:40:24.018 --> 1:40:25.562
Preachers have to be awfully pious.

1:40:25.729 --> 1:40:28.273
And when they fall from grace,
they fall harder.

1:40:28.440 --> 1:40:29.441
People laugh.

1:40:29.524 --> 1:40:31.443
Tammy, we have a bit of goop
on our face.

1:40:31.526 --> 1:40:32.902
-You've taken her makeup off.

1:40:32.986 --> 1:40:34.738
-

1:40:34.821 --> 1:40:36.740
I saw his wife.
I heard the accusations,

1:40:36.823 --> 1:40:38.616
wife-swapping, homosexuality.

1:40:38.783 --> 1:40:40.577
woman?

1:40:40.744 --> 1:40:43.163
I'd swap her for a can of soup.

1:40:43.329 --> 1:40:45.331
REPORTER: National news, special report.

1:40:45.540 --> 1:40:48.877
Jim Bakker was found guilty
on all 24 counts of wire and...

1:40:49.085 --> 1:40:51.171
-Guilty.
-Guilty.

1:40:51.337 --> 1:40:54.841
He now faces up to a 120 years in prison

1:40:54.924 --> 1:40:56.968
and $5 million in fines.

1:40:57.135 --> 1:40:58.470
TAMMY: Ted, can I say something?

1:40:58.636 --> 1:40:59.637
TED: Sure.

1:40:59.721 --> 1:41:03.725
I just wanna say, remember,
God loves you.

1:41:03.892 --> 1:41:07.187
I wanna say that, too.
God loves you.

1:41:07.353 --> 1:41:10.064
-He really does. Bye-bye.
-He really, really does.

1:41:10.231 --> 1:41:12.317
TED: All right. Thank you both
very much for being with us.

1:41:12.484 --> 1:41:13.485
WOMAN: We're clear.

1:41:37.634 --> 1:41:39.761
It's all right, honey. Don't cry.

1:41:44.557 --> 1:41:45.975
No.

1:41:46.142 --> 1:41:48.603
I didn't do anything. Please.

1:41:51.439 --> 1:41:52.774
TAMMY: I have a song for you.

1:41:53.608 --> 1:41:55.360
On Christ

1:41:55.527 --> 1:42:00.031
The solid rock I stand

1:42:00.198 --> 1:42:06.746
All other ground is sinking sand

1:42:06.913 --> 1:42:13.127
All other ground is sinking sand

1:42:22.720 --> 1:42:24.013
TAMMY: God...

1:42:24.931 --> 1:42:28.351
I followed you ever since
I was a little girl.

1:42:30.854 --> 1:42:32.647
I loved you.

1:42:34.482 --> 1:42:36.317
I served you.

1:42:39.070 --> 1:42:40.989
And I worked for you.

1:42:44.158 --> 1:42:45.451
God...

1:42:48.413 --> 1:42:50.331
where have you gone?

1:42:51.958 --> 1:42:54.752
-It's not over till it's over.
-

1:43:31.205 --> 1:43:33.082
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

1:43:34.959 --> 1:43:35.960
-Hi.
-Hi.

1:43:36.044 --> 1:43:38.254
-Nice to meet ya. I'm Tammy.
-Nice to meet you. Stephen.

1:43:38.338 --> 1:43:39.881
All right. You need a water or anything?

1:43:39.964 --> 1:43:41.424
-Oh, no, I'm good.
-Okay.

1:43:41.591 --> 1:43:42.842
My new headshot.

1:43:43.009 --> 1:43:45.595
Yeah, all right. Nice.

1:43:46.304 --> 1:43:48.222
All right. So...

1:43:48.723 --> 1:43:50.183
I hear you're here to pitch me something.

1:43:50.266 --> 1:43:52.810
So I should... I'll... Yeah.

1:43:53.728 --> 1:43:55.563
So, I have two ideas for you, Stephen.

1:43:55.730 --> 1:43:58.733
And then I'd like to hear
what you see me doing.

1:43:59.275 --> 1:44:00.276
Okay.

1:44:00.652 --> 1:44:04.072
Okay. Um, the first one is about puppets.

1:44:04.238 --> 1:44:06.449
I mean, it's serious, but it's also funny.

1:44:06.616 --> 1:44:09.869
It's a talk show but with puppets.

1:44:09.953 --> 1:44:11.663
And it's for kids and also for adults.

1:44:11.829 --> 1:44:16.000
And it's a way for people
to talk about their problems,

1:44:16.209 --> 1:44:17.669
but with puppets.

1:44:19.587 --> 1:44:20.797
Okay.

1:44:22.423 --> 1:44:24.509
Okay, I have something else
for you, Stephen.

1:44:24.759 --> 1:44:27.136
-Oh, okay, another one.
-It's for teenagers.

1:44:27.303 --> 1:44:29.931
You know, the biggest problem
that they say is,

1:44:30.098 --> 1:44:33.017
"How can we get people to listen to us?"

1:44:33.184 --> 1:44:35.353
And I would really love
to give them that chance

1:44:35.520 --> 1:44:37.021
and, you know, go where they go.

1:44:37.188 --> 1:44:39.816
I'd love to go to the piercing parlors
with them,

1:44:39.983 --> 1:44:42.652
I'd love to go to the tattoo places
with them, and...

1:44:42.819 --> 1:44:44.153
And you would call this show, what?

1:44:44.320 --> 1:44:46.155
-"Tammy's Terrific Teens."
-Oh, yeah.

1:44:46.322 --> 1:44:48.449
I thought that would be,
you know, a fun title.

1:44:48.616 --> 1:44:50.159
I was just curious.

1:44:50.827 --> 1:44:52.870
Well, what do you see me doing, Stephen?

1:44:52.954 --> 1:44:54.956
I mean, you're the expert.

1:44:55.748 --> 1:44:58.918
Well, have you reached out
to any Christian networks or anything?

1:45:01.379 --> 1:45:03.214
Well, they won't have me.

1:45:03.381 --> 1:45:07.301
Okay. Well, what I've learned
from doing these shows,

1:45:07.468 --> 1:45:09.846
and I think you've learned as well, is,

1:45:10.013 --> 1:45:11.055
you know, it is dangerous

1:45:11.139 --> 1:45:13.725
to wanna be seen just
for the sake of it. You know?

1:45:13.891 --> 1:45:16.102
Well, I do love the camera, but...

1:45:16.185 --> 1:45:17.270
Why?

1:45:17.770 --> 1:45:19.022
Well, because it's a person.

1:45:19.188 --> 1:45:20.732
It's someone to talk to.

1:45:20.898 --> 1:45:24.235
It's... It's God's love through me.

1:45:27.196 --> 1:45:28.448
So what do you think, Stephen?

1:45:28.531 --> 1:45:30.241
You know, would you like to do a show?

1:45:31.534 --> 1:45:33.327
I don't know, Tammy.

1:45:33.411 --> 1:45:36.289
I just don't think
it's a good fit for us right now.

1:45:36.873 --> 1:45:37.874
Okay?

1:45:39.876 --> 1:45:42.211
Well, well, I... I...

1:45:43.296 --> 1:45:44.964
-I really appreciate...
-Thank you for coming in.

1:45:45.131 --> 1:45:46.716
-Thank you.
-Thanks for coming through.

1:45:46.883 --> 1:45:48.843
We'll take care
of your parking validation.

1:45:49.010 --> 1:45:50.303
-Thank you.
-TAMMY: Okay.

1:45:51.095 --> 1:45:52.555
You have a good one.

1:45:55.933 --> 1:45:57.310
-Bye.
-Bye.

1:45:58.519 --> 1:45:59.771
TAMMY: Oops.

1:46:18.873 --> 1:46:20.166
BOY 1: Oh, man.

1:46:21.209 --> 1:46:23.002
BOY 2: What'd she do to her face?

1:46:25.922 --> 1:46:28.883
BOY 1: I told you she lived here.
What a freak.

1:46:34.013 --> 1:46:35.848
-Oh, man.
-Hi.

1:46:36.015 --> 1:46:37.558
BOY 2: Oh, shit.
She's comin' over here.

1:46:37.725 --> 1:46:40.228
-You guys just hangin' out?
-BOY 2: Yeah.

1:46:41.521 --> 1:46:45.608
So, you can talk about me.
That's all right.

1:46:45.775 --> 1:46:47.401
But, you know,
you gotta shake my hand,

1:46:47.485 --> 1:46:49.487
and you gotta say hi first.

1:46:51.239 --> 1:46:52.615
-Hi.
-Hi, nice to meet ya.

1:46:52.698 --> 1:46:53.950
I'm Tammy. What's your name?

1:46:54.033 --> 1:46:55.660
-Um, Max.
-Hi.

1:46:55.827 --> 1:46:57.078
But, you know, we're not strangers.

1:46:57.161 --> 1:46:59.205
I live right there. We're neighbors.

1:47:00.123 --> 1:47:02.166
Oh! Let me show you guys what I just got.

1:47:03.042 --> 1:47:07.004
Who would like a picture?

1:47:10.299 --> 1:47:12.093
Jolene, I cannot believe
that you have eaten

1:47:12.176 --> 1:47:14.262
almost an entire jar of peanut butter.

1:47:14.428 --> 1:47:15.555
JOLENE: Well, I'm sorry, Susanne.

1:47:15.638 --> 1:47:17.431
I happen to be eating for two.

1:47:17.598 --> 1:47:18.766
Don't beg.

1:47:18.850 --> 1:47:20.059
-

1:47:20.143 --> 1:47:21.561
Okay, you're being so good.

1:47:21.727 --> 1:47:22.979
SUSANNE: I say, have at it.

1:47:23.771 --> 1:47:25.106
JOLENE: You know, Susanne,
since you're having

1:47:25.189 --> 1:47:26.566
so much trouble collecting
money for your benefit,

1:47:26.649 --> 1:47:28.151
I might be able to help you out.

1:47:28.234 --> 1:47:29.944
-SUSANNE: You, how?
-

1:47:30.111 --> 1:47:31.571
TAMMY: God bless you.
You've reached Tammy.

1:47:31.654 --> 1:47:32.905
Leave me a message.

1:47:35.324 --> 1:47:37.535
Hello, Mrs. Bakker.
This is Linda Thomas

1:47:37.618 --> 1:47:39.203
from Oral Roberts School of Divinity.

1:47:39.370 --> 1:47:42.373
You probably don't remember
but I volunteered at PTL.

1:47:42.540 --> 1:47:44.458
You were always so nice to me.

1:47:44.667 --> 1:47:46.502
Anyway, I'm calling to invite you to sing

1:47:46.669 --> 1:47:48.838
at this year's festival
of Praise and Redemption.

1:47:49.005 --> 1:47:51.340
I think you'd be a wonderful
addition to our program.

1:47:51.507 --> 1:47:53.509
We'll check back with you
to find out if you're interested.

1:47:53.676 --> 1:47:55.052
Thanks very much.

1:48:26.417 --> 1:48:28.044
-JIM: Hi.
- Hi.

1:48:44.852 --> 1:48:46.979
Oh. I don't know.

1:48:49.232 --> 1:48:51.817
I got an invitation
from Oral Roberts to sing.

1:48:52.652 --> 1:48:54.070
-Wow.
-Yeah.

1:48:54.237 --> 1:48:55.821
That's wonderful.

1:48:56.739 --> 1:48:57.949
-I'm not gonna do it though.
-You should.

1:48:58.032 --> 1:48:59.867
No, I haven't been in church for years.

1:49:00.034 --> 1:49:01.035
Well, that's where you belong.

1:49:01.118 --> 1:49:02.703
No, I don't belong with them.

1:49:02.787 --> 1:49:04.413
They're gonna laugh.

1:49:04.497 --> 1:49:05.498
I'm not gonna go.

1:49:05.581 --> 1:49:07.541
It's my fault you feel that way.

1:49:07.750 --> 1:49:09.126
I'm sorry for that.

1:49:10.169 --> 1:49:11.337
All of it.

1:49:13.965 --> 1:49:15.132
I pray for you, Jim.

1:49:15.800 --> 1:49:18.970
And I pray that God will use you again.

1:49:20.471 --> 1:49:21.597
Yes.

1:49:26.060 --> 1:49:28.312
I appreciate you signing
the divorce papers, Jim.

1:49:28.479 --> 1:49:29.939
I didn't want to, Tam.

1:49:30.564 --> 1:49:31.649
I know.

1:49:33.609 --> 1:49:36.112
But, you know, we've just been
through too much together

1:49:36.279 --> 1:49:39.115
and, you know,
there's been too many hurts

1:49:39.282 --> 1:49:41.617
that have happened over the years.

1:49:42.451 --> 1:49:43.786
And that poor girl, Jim.

1:49:43.953 --> 1:49:46.122
I know, I know. I know.

1:49:46.706 --> 1:49:48.791
I'm ashamed of that.

1:49:49.500 --> 1:49:52.920
I've been getting some real me
and God time in here

1:49:53.087 --> 1:49:54.630
and everything looks very, very different

1:49:54.714 --> 1:49:56.215
when you're looking at it
from the bottom up.

1:49:56.674 --> 1:49:57.925
-Well, yeah.
-Yeah.

1:49:58.092 --> 1:49:59.385
And I've just been thinking,

1:50:00.344 --> 1:50:02.263
were we preaching

1:50:02.972 --> 1:50:06.142
that God doesn't love you if you're poor?

1:50:07.435 --> 1:50:09.270
Well, you know that I grew up poor.

1:50:11.147 --> 1:50:13.733
It's not what you have in stuff,

1:50:13.816 --> 1:50:16.110
it's the people that count.

1:50:16.902 --> 1:50:18.696
-Amen.
-Amen.

1:50:34.128 --> 1:50:35.463
RACHEL: Tammy.

1:50:37.298 --> 1:50:38.382
Mom?

1:50:43.304 --> 1:50:45.973
PASTOR: "We therefore
were buried with him

1:50:46.057 --> 1:50:47.558
"through baptism into death.

1:50:48.559 --> 1:50:49.560
"In order that,

1:50:49.727 --> 1:50:51.854
"just as Christ was raised from the dead

1:50:51.937 --> 1:50:53.689
"through the glory of the Father,

1:50:54.523 --> 1:50:58.110
"we too may walk in newness of life."

1:51:00.112 --> 1:51:02.198
MAN: Such a good service.

1:51:02.365 --> 1:51:03.657
FRED: Hello, Tom. Thanks for comin'.

1:51:06.035 --> 1:51:07.495
There you are.

1:51:08.329 --> 1:51:10.373
Aren't you gonna come in,
have somethin' to eat?

1:51:10.539 --> 1:51:13.501
I don't belong in there with them.

1:51:13.667 --> 1:51:14.919
Yeah.

1:51:16.212 --> 1:51:18.089
One good thing about your mum
kicking the bucket is

1:51:18.255 --> 1:51:20.216
I never have to go to church again.

1:51:22.385 --> 1:51:24.345
No, I shouldn't laugh at that.

1:51:26.639 --> 1:51:29.058
-Oh, I did something terrible.
-Oh?

1:51:32.603 --> 1:51:34.897
You're forgiven.
-

1:51:35.689 --> 1:51:38.692
Ooh. Wow, she really was blind,
wasn't she?

1:51:38.818 --> 1:51:40.403
Mm-hmm.

1:51:41.987 --> 1:51:43.781
I got somethin' for ya.

1:51:44.615 --> 1:51:46.617
You recognize this?

1:51:49.412 --> 1:51:51.330
I thought Falwell took everything.

1:51:51.497 --> 1:51:52.832
She hid this.

1:51:52.998 --> 1:51:54.750
She stole it.

1:51:54.917 --> 1:51:56.210
Well, she said she'd be damned

1:51:56.377 --> 1:51:58.212
if she was gonna hand over
this precious thing

1:51:58.379 --> 1:51:59.880
her daughter
worked so hard for

1:52:00.047 --> 1:52:02.258
-to the fat Baptist.
-

1:52:30.244 --> 1:52:32.413
We're opening the house now, Ms. Bakker.

1:52:32.496 --> 1:52:34.540
People are taking their seats.

1:52:39.587 --> 1:52:41.547
Well, hello there, Tammy.

1:52:43.257 --> 1:52:44.508
Hi, there.

1:52:47.386 --> 1:52:48.721
I'm scared.

1:52:56.228 --> 1:53:00.733
Jesus, come in to my heart,
and forgive me my sins.

1:53:02.109 --> 1:53:04.570
I know I cared about things
that I shouldn't have.

1:53:06.363 --> 1:53:08.282
And I know I got lost...

1:53:10.868 --> 1:53:14.246
and I forgot who you are to me...

1:53:17.208 --> 1:53:18.834
but that's done now.

1:53:20.711 --> 1:53:22.796
Yeah, I won't go forward

1:53:22.880 --> 1:53:26.175
looking in the rearview mirror of my life.

1:53:27.593 --> 1:53:29.470
On stage in 10 minutes.

1:53:47.571 --> 1:53:48.906
Thank you.

1:53:50.241 --> 1:53:51.617
Here, this is for the piano player.

1:53:51.784 --> 1:53:52.785
Okay.

1:54:09.301 --> 1:54:10.469
ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen...

1:54:11.637 --> 1:54:15.474
...please welcome tonight's special guest,

1:54:15.641 --> 1:54:17.226
Tammy Faye.

1:54:17.309 --> 1:54:19.311
-

1:54:25.609 --> 1:54:26.610
TAMMY: Aw.

1:54:27.403 --> 1:54:30.447
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1:54:33.576 --> 1:54:36.870
I am genuinely, I am so happy

1:54:36.954 --> 1:54:39.373
to be back where I once belonged.

1:54:43.961 --> 1:54:48.132
This morning when I was
in need of some comfort,

1:54:48.299 --> 1:54:50.968
I turned to my favorite scripture,

1:54:51.135 --> 1:54:52.761
Psalms 91.

1:54:55.889 --> 1:54:58.475
"He that dwelleth in the secret place

1:54:58.559 --> 1:55:00.060
"of the most high

1:55:02.062 --> 1:55:06.275
"shall abide under the shadow
of the Almighty."

1:55:16.160 --> 1:55:19.038
"He shall cover thee with His feathers

1:55:20.789 --> 1:55:22.541
"and under His wings

1:55:23.709 --> 1:55:26.211
"shalt thou trust."

1:55:29.757 --> 1:55:32.801
Well, I haven't had a concert
in almost a decade

1:55:34.386 --> 1:55:36.513
and I am a little nervous.

1:55:38.307 --> 1:55:39.683
But I'll do my best

1:55:40.225 --> 1:55:43.854
to deliver Him to you folks tonight. Okay?

1:55:51.945 --> 1:55:53.572
Mine eyes

1:55:54.365 --> 1:55:56.742
Have seen the glory

1:55:58.077 --> 1:56:01.997
Of the coming of the Lord

1:56:03.040 --> 1:56:06.669
He is trampling out the vintage

1:56:07.586 --> 1:56:13.008
Where the grapes of wrath are stored

1:56:13.884 --> 1:56:15.803
He hath loosed

1:56:16.887 --> 1:56:18.972
The fateful lightning

1:56:20.599 --> 1:56:25.020
Of His terrible, swift sword

1:56:27.564 --> 1:56:34.530
His truth is marching on

1:56:36.657 --> 1:56:43.622
Glory, glory, hallelujah

1:56:43.831 --> 1:56:50.796
Glory, glory, hallelujah

1:56:51.004 --> 1:56:57.386
Glory, glory, hallelujah

1:56:57.553 --> 1:57:04.518
His truth is marching on

1:57:04.685 --> 1:57:08.313
-I have read His fiery gospel

1:57:08.480 --> 1:57:11.692
Writ in burnished rows of steel

1:57:11.859 --> 1:57:15.487
"As ye deal with my condemners

1:57:15.696 --> 1:57:18.490
"So with you my grace shall deal"

1:57:18.657 --> 1:57:22.369
Let the Hero, born of woman

1:57:22.536 --> 1:57:25.748
Crush the serpent with his heel

1:57:25.914 --> 1:57:32.713
Since God is marching on

1:57:33.088 --> 1:57:35.758
Come on, everybody!
Feel his miracle!

1:57:37.217 --> 1:57:44.016
Glory, glory, hallelujah

1:57:44.183 --> 1:57:50.189
Glory, glory, hallelujah

1:57:51.482 --> 1:57:57.529
Glory, glory, hallelujah

1:57:57.738 --> 1:58:04.536
His truth is marching on

1:58:04.953 --> 1:58:07.206
Oh, how thankful I am

1:58:07.372 --> 1:58:09.958
for the amazing grace of God.

1:58:10.542 --> 1:58:13.045
Because without that beautiful grace,

1:58:13.212 --> 1:58:15.297
I wouldn't even be here today.

1:58:16.089 --> 1:58:18.091
That grace that reached down and said,

1:58:18.258 --> 1:58:21.929
"Tammy Faye, I love you.

1:58:22.095 --> 1:58:25.015
"And I love you just the way you are."

1:58:25.474 --> 1:58:29.144
You know God's grace is sufficient enough
for you today, too.

1:58:29.311 --> 1:58:33.816
And He loves you just the way you are!

1:58:33.982 --> 1:58:40.614
Glory, glory, hallelujah

1:58:40.823 --> 1:58:46.829
Glory, glory, hallelujah

1:58:48.121 --> 1:58:54.378
Glory, glory, hallelujah

1:58:54.545 --> 1:59:00.843
His truth is marching on

1:59:01.552 --> 1:59:05.222
Our God is

1:59:06.181 --> 1:59:09.852
Marching

1:59:10.018 --> 1:59:15.357
On

1:59:18.318 --> 1:59:22.197
Thank you, Lord,
for the United States of America.

1:59:22.406 --> 1:59:23.740
We thank you, Lord,

1:59:23.824 --> 1:59:27.077
that we live in this wonderful country.

1:59:27.244 --> 1:59:31.540
God bless America. Hallelujah.

1:59:32.124 --> 1:59:33.709
Oh, yeah.

2:00:26.803 --> 2:00:30.265
It's not over till it's over.
