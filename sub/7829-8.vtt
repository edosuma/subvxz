(tires screech)

00:09.342 --> 00:10.343
D'oh!

00:10.427 --> 00:12.971
-Aah!
-(tires screech)

00:13.054 --> 00:14.305
(screeches)

00:27.944 --> 00:29.946
Here's your
caption boys:

00:30.030 --> 00:33.033
"Local hero shuns spotlight
and pitches in."

00:33.116 --> 00:33.992
What an angle.

00:37.829 --> 00:40.457
I can't believe I'm spending
my Saturday picking up garbage.

00:40.540 --> 00:41.666
I mean, half these bottles
ain't even mine.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.501
(clears throat)

00:43.585 --> 00:46.880
Let's have less conversation
and more sanitation.

00:46.963 --> 00:48.423
(all grumbling)

00:51.760 --> 00:52.677
Hey, where's Homer?

00:52.761 --> 00:54.304
How'd he get
out of this?

00:54.387 --> 00:55.472
HOMER:
Hey, everybody!

00:55.555 --> 00:56.931
Up here!

00:58.349 --> 01:00.018
Simpson, stop frolicking
and get to work.

01:00.101 --> 01:01.686
Right away, Mr. Smithers.

01:01.770 --> 01:05.023
I'll just walk across
these slippery ro... aah!

01:06.649 --> 01:08.401
Oh, no! He's going
over the falls!

01:11.529 --> 01:13.615
Oh, good. He snagged
that tree branch.

01:13.698 --> 01:15.408
Oh, no!
The branch broke off.

01:17.118 --> 01:19.245
Oh, good. He can grab on
to them pointy rocks.

01:19.329 --> 01:20.538
Oh, no!

01:20.622 --> 01:22.499
Them rocks broke
his arms and legs.

01:23.792 --> 01:25.460
Oh, good.
Those helpful beavers

01:25.543 --> 01:26.503
are swimming out
to save him.

01:26.586 --> 01:28.129
Oh, no.

01:28.213 --> 01:30.632
They're biting him
and stealing his pants.

01:32.717 --> 01:34.469
Good Lord. He'll be sucked
into the turbine.

01:37.680 --> 01:38.598
(all gasp)

01:40.183 --> 01:42.644
Smithers,
Who was that corpse?

01:42.727 --> 01:44.145
Homer Simpson, sir.

01:44.229 --> 01:45.355
(sniffling)

01:45.438 --> 01:47.357
One of the finest,
bravest men

01:47.440 --> 01:49.609
ever to grace Sector 7G.

01:49.692 --> 01:51.653
(sobbing)

01:51.736 --> 01:54.531
I'll cross him
off the list.

01:54.614 --> 01:55.698
(Bart laughing)

01:55.782 --> 01:57.617
That dummy worked
like a charm, Dad.

01:57.700 --> 01:59.410
Best 600 bucks
I ever spent.

01:59.494 --> 02:00.495
Come on, boy.

02:00.578 --> 02:01.663
We've earned this Saturday.

02:01.746 --> 02:04.082
Now let's make
the most of it!

02:08.837 --> 02:12.048
61, 62, 63...

02:17.053 --> 02:19.889
Marge, we can't tell you
how sorry we are.

02:19.973 --> 02:23.268
You have our deepest
condol-diddly-olences.

02:23.351 --> 02:24.894
I'm sorry.
I-I'm just nervous.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.104
I didn't mean
any disrespect.

02:26.187 --> 02:27.272
What are you talking about?

02:27.355 --> 02:28.273
You know, uh...

02:29.440 --> 02:30.608
Homer's passing.

02:32.193 --> 02:33.069
Away.

02:34.404 --> 02:35.321
Into death.

02:35.405 --> 02:37.198
What?

02:37.282 --> 02:40.285
That's ridiculous.
Homer's not dead.

02:40.368 --> 02:41.661
He's right out back
in the hammock.

02:45.790 --> 02:47.876
Oh, Marge, of course
Homer's alive.

02:47.959 --> 02:50.545
He's alive in
all our hearts.

02:50.628 --> 02:51.588
Yes, Marge.

02:51.671 --> 02:52.589
I can see him.

02:52.672 --> 02:55.425
Hi, everybody.

02:55.508 --> 02:56.551
Marge, I'm going to
give you the card

02:56.634 --> 02:57.886
of our juvenile
counselor.

02:57.969 --> 02:58.887
(doorbell rings)

03:01.097 --> 03:02.974
A tombstone?

03:03.057 --> 03:04.350
It came with
the burial plot.

03:04.434 --> 03:05.810
But that's
not important.

03:05.894 --> 03:08.104
The important thing is,
Homer's dead.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.231
We've been saving for this
since your wedding day.

03:10.315 --> 03:12.775
Get out of here
you ghouls!

03:12.859 --> 03:15.612
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi.

03:15.695 --> 03:16.821
Hmm?

03:18.406 --> 03:19.782
Uh, excuse me.

03:19.866 --> 03:22.368
Sir, I think there's
been a mistake.

03:22.452 --> 03:23.745
Oh, no. No mistake.

03:23.828 --> 03:24.913
Your electricity's
in the name

03:24.996 --> 03:26.748
of Homer J. Simpson,
deceased.

03:26.831 --> 03:29.209
The juice stays off till you
get a job or a generator.

03:29.292 --> 03:31.169
Oh, and, uh, my
deepest sympathies.

03:31.252 --> 03:33.504
Mmm... Homer?

03:33.588 --> 03:34.547
That's my name.

03:34.631 --> 03:36.007
When I asked you
if that dummy

03:36.090 --> 03:38.092
was to fake your own
death, you told me no.

03:38.176 --> 03:39.719
You go downtown first
thing in the morning

03:39.802 --> 03:41.262
and straighten this out.

03:41.346 --> 03:42.764
LISA:
Mom! Dad!

03:42.847 --> 03:45.266
Bart ran into a doorframe
and bit his tongue!

03:45.350 --> 03:47.227
BART: What the hell'th
goin' on heah?

03:50.063 --> 03:51.940
Listen here. My name
is Homer J. Simpson.

03:52.023 --> 03:53.858
You guys think I'm dead,
but I'm not.

03:53.942 --> 03:55.610
Now I want you
to straighten this out

03:55.693 --> 03:57.111
without a lot of your bureaucratic
red tape and mumbo jumbo.

03:57.195 --> 03:58.988
Okay, Mr. Simpson

03:59.072 --> 04:02.575
I'll just make the change
here... and you're all set.

04:02.659 --> 04:05.703
I don't like your attitude,
you water-cooler dictator.

04:05.787 --> 04:07.705
What do you have in that
secret government file, anyway?

04:07.789 --> 04:08.831
I have a right to read it.

04:08.915 --> 04:10.458
You sure do.

04:10.541 --> 04:11.668
"Wife: Marjorie.

04:11.751 --> 04:13.670
Children: Bartholomew,
Lisa..."

04:13.753 --> 04:17.507
Ah-hah! See? This thing
is all screwed up.

04:17.590 --> 04:19.425
Who the heck
is "Margaret" Simpson?

04:19.509 --> 04:20.760
Uh... your youngest daughter.

04:20.843 --> 04:23.388
(mimicking)
"Uh... your youngest daughter."

04:23.471 --> 04:24.847
Well, how about this?

04:24.931 --> 04:26.641
This thing says
my mother's still alive!

04:26.724 --> 04:28.476
She died when I was a kid!

04:28.559 --> 04:29.978
You see that stone angel
up there?

04:30.061 --> 04:32.021
That's my mother's grave.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.732
My Dad points it out
every time we drive by.

04:34.816 --> 04:36.401
Mr. Simpson, uh...

04:36.484 --> 04:37.652
maybe you should actually

04:37.735 --> 04:38.945
go up there.

04:39.028 --> 04:40.029
Huh?

04:41.572 --> 04:44.325
Oh, Mom, I'm sorry
I never come to see you.

04:44.409 --> 04:46.119
I'm just not a cemetery person.

04:46.202 --> 04:48.454
"Here lies...

04:48.538 --> 04:49.789
Walt Whitman"?

04:49.872 --> 04:51.207
(yelling)

04:51.291 --> 04:52.709
Damn you, Walt Whitman!

04:52.792 --> 04:57.046
I-hate-you-
Walt-freakin'-Whitman!

04:57.130 --> 04:59.590
Leaves of Grass, my ass!

04:59.674 --> 05:01.467
Wait a minute.

05:01.551 --> 05:05.680
Maybe it's that other grave--
the one that says "Simpson"!

05:05.763 --> 05:06.723
(shrieking)

05:06.806 --> 05:08.308
Oh!

05:08.391 --> 05:10.810
Why does my death
keep coming back to haunt me?

05:10.893 --> 05:12.061
Oh!

05:13.771 --> 05:15.940
You awful, awful man!

05:16.024 --> 05:17.734
Get out of my son's grave!

05:17.817 --> 05:21.195
I hate to rain on your parade,
lady, but this is my grave.

05:21.279 --> 05:22.572
Hey...

05:22.655 --> 05:23.781
wait a minute...

05:23.865 --> 05:25.158
Mom?

05:25.241 --> 05:26.701
Homer?

05:29.996 --> 05:31.372
I thought you were dead!

05:31.456 --> 05:33.291
I thought you were dead!

05:33.374 --> 05:35.126
Oh, dang blast it.

05:35.209 --> 05:37.962
Isn't anybody in this
dad-gummed cemetery dead?

05:38.046 --> 05:40.131
I didn't want
to cause a fuss

05:40.214 --> 05:41.758
but now that
you mention it...

05:44.344 --> 05:49.265
Oh, Homer, you
grew up so handsome.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.309
Some people say
I look like Dan Aykroyd.

05:52.935 --> 05:54.896
I can't believe
you're here.

05:54.979 --> 05:57.565
Dad always told me you died
while I was at the movies.

05:57.648 --> 06:00.234
Oh, my poor baby.

06:00.318 --> 06:03.404
You must have been so upset.

06:03.488 --> 06:05.406
But I suppose Abe
has his reasons.

06:05.490 --> 06:08.451
Yeah, well... where have you
been all this time?

06:08.534 --> 06:11.287
Oh, it's a very
complicated story.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.872
Let's just enjoy
this moment.

06:12.955 --> 06:15.291
Mom, there's something
you should know about me.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.335
I almost always
spoil the moment.

06:20.088 --> 06:21.339
(burping)

06:21.422 --> 06:22.673
I'm sorry.

06:22.757 --> 06:24.425
That's okay, darling.

06:24.509 --> 06:25.426
It wasn't your fault.

06:27.720 --> 06:30.681
Hey, everybody, I got
a big surprise for you.

06:30.765 --> 06:33.267
Presenting... my mother!

06:33.351 --> 06:35.353
(gasps)

06:35.436 --> 06:36.396
Your mother?
That's Grandma Simpson?

06:36.479 --> 06:38.231
Can you
believe it?

06:38.314 --> 06:39.315
I thought
she was dead.

06:39.399 --> 06:40.316
Hello.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.692
This is so weird.

06:41.776 --> 06:43.444
It's like something
out of Dickens

06:43.528 --> 06:44.904
or Melrose Place.

06:44.987 --> 06:46.280
Where have you
been, Granny?

06:46.364 --> 06:47.281
Did they freeze
you or something?

06:47.365 --> 06:48.574
(laughing)

06:48.658 --> 06:50.535
Oh, my,
such clever grandchildren.

06:50.618 --> 06:54.038
So full of questions
and bright, shiny eyes.

06:54.122 --> 06:55.623
I don't know what to say.

06:55.706 --> 06:56.958
I finally have a mother-in-law.

06:57.041 --> 06:58.584
(giggling)

06:58.668 --> 07:00.962
No more living vicariously
through my girlfriends.

07:01.045 --> 07:02.672
(giggles and coughs)

07:02.755 --> 07:03.881
Hey.

07:03.965 --> 07:05.341
Since you
were a no-show

07:05.425 --> 07:07.051
at all the big
moments of my life,

07:07.135 --> 07:09.554
you owe me years
of back presents.

07:09.637 --> 07:13.349
Christmases, birthdays, Easters,
Kwanzas, good report cards...

07:13.433 --> 07:16.436
Hmm. 75 bucks a pop
plus interest and penalties...

07:16.519 --> 07:19.188
You owe me $22,000.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.440
I'll Kwanza you!

07:20.523 --> 07:22.358
Gaa! Gaa!

07:22.442 --> 07:24.902
Homer, don't be so hard
on little...

07:24.986 --> 07:26.529
(whispering)
What is his name?

07:26.612 --> 07:27.989
This is my room.

07:28.072 --> 07:29.907
This is my dresser.

07:29.991 --> 07:31.534
It's where I keep my shirts
when I'm not wearing them.

07:31.617 --> 07:34.078
Oh, yes,
right in the drawers.

07:34.162 --> 07:35.580
(both laughing)

07:37.373 --> 07:39.959
You remembered.

07:40.042 --> 07:44.547
Oh, I've missed moments
like this... Mom.

07:44.630 --> 07:46.424
I saw all
your awards, Lisa.

07:46.507 --> 07:48.092
They're mighty impressive.

07:48.176 --> 07:50.344
Oh, I just keep them
out to bug Bart.

07:50.428 --> 07:51.596
Don't be bashful.

07:51.679 --> 07:53.556
When I was your age,
kids made fun of me

07:53.639 --> 07:55.558
because I read at
the ninth-grade level.

07:55.641 --> 07:57.268
Me too!

07:57.351 --> 07:58.478
Hey, Mom, look at me!

07:58.561 --> 08:00.271
Look at what I can do!

08:00.354 --> 08:01.355
I see you, Homer.

08:01.439 --> 08:02.857
That's very nice.

08:02.940 --> 08:05.776
Although I hardly consider
"A Separate Peace"

08:05.860 --> 08:06.903
the ninth-grade level.

08:06.986 --> 08:08.571
Yeah, more like preschool.

08:08.654 --> 08:09.572
I hate John Knowles.

08:09.655 --> 08:10.573
Me too.

08:10.656 --> 08:13.284
(both laughing)

08:13.367 --> 08:15.536
(both sighing)

08:15.620 --> 08:18.206
Mom, you're not
looking!

08:18.289 --> 08:20.291
You know, Lisa,
I feel like I have

08:20.374 --> 08:22.460
an instant rapport with you.

08:22.543 --> 08:24.837
(gasps)
You didn't dumb it down.

08:24.921 --> 08:26.797
You said "rapport."

08:29.008 --> 08:30.426
Got to run.
Grandma stuff.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.766
Huh?

08:36.849 --> 08:38.976
(turns dryer on)

08:39.060 --> 08:40.811
There. Now no one should
be able to hear us.

08:40.895 --> 08:41.812
What?

08:41.896 --> 08:43.231
(turns dryer off)

08:43.314 --> 08:44.232
All right, we don't
need the dryer.

08:44.315 --> 08:45.274
What?!

08:45.358 --> 08:47.318
Just shut up and listen.

08:47.401 --> 08:49.278
There's something
fishy about Grandma.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.405
Whenever we ask her where
she's been all this time

08:51.489 --> 08:52.949
she changes the subject.

08:53.032 --> 08:54.575
And just now when a
police car drove by

08:54.659 --> 08:56.118
she ran into the house.

08:56.202 --> 08:57.662
Yeah, I don't
trust her, either.

08:57.745 --> 08:58.996
When I was going
through her purse

08:59.080 --> 09:00.039
look what I found.

09:00.122 --> 09:01.499
LISA:
"Mona Simpson."

09:01.582 --> 09:02.833
"Mona Stevens."

09:02.917 --> 09:04.085
"Martha Stewart."

09:04.168 --> 09:05.336
"Penelope Olsen."

09:05.419 --> 09:07.838
"Muddy Mae Suggins."

09:07.922 --> 09:10.633
These are the calling cards

09:12.510 --> 09:13.803
Whoo-hoo!

09:13.886 --> 09:15.596
I'm so glad
to have my Mom back.

09:15.680 --> 09:18.099
I never realized
how much I missed her.

09:19.350 --> 09:20.560
She's nice.

09:20.643 --> 09:22.186
But?

09:22.270 --> 09:23.938
I just don't think
you should get too excited

09:24.021 --> 09:26.899
about the woman who
abandoned you for 25 years.

09:26.983 --> 09:28.317
You could get hurt again.

09:28.401 --> 09:31.070
First, it wasn't 25 years.

09:31.153 --> 09:33.155
It was 27 years.

09:33.239 --> 09:35.366
And second, she had
a very good reason.

09:35.449 --> 09:36.492
Which was?

09:36.576 --> 09:38.536
I don't know.

09:38.619 --> 09:40.871
I guess I was
just a horrible son

09:40.955 --> 09:42.498
(crying)
and no mother would want me.

09:42.582 --> 09:43.916
Oh, Homie.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.085
Come on, you're a sweet,
kind, loving man.

09:46.168 --> 09:48.421
I'm sure you were
a wonderful son.

09:48.504 --> 09:50.256
Then why did she leave me?

09:50.339 --> 09:51.591
Let's find out.

09:54.510 --> 09:56.345
Mother Simpson,
we'd like to ask you

09:56.429 --> 09:58.097
a few questions
about your past.

09:58.180 --> 09:59.724
Can't reminisce.
Sleeping.

09:59.807 --> 10:01.183
(snoring)

10:02.935 --> 10:04.562
Spill it, Muddy Mae,
or we're calling the cops.

10:04.645 --> 10:06.063
Please don't.

10:06.147 --> 10:08.649
Alright, then we'll call
your husband-- Grampa.

10:08.733 --> 10:10.234
No! I'll talk.

10:10.318 --> 10:11.360
I'll tell you everything.

10:11.444 --> 10:12.945
I've wanted to tell you.

10:13.029 --> 10:16.574
It all started in the '60s.

10:18.326 --> 10:20.161
Take out wrenched ankle.

10:20.244 --> 10:21.287
(buzzing)

10:21.370 --> 10:24.832
Mom! Mom! Mom!

10:26.250 --> 10:27.877
Oh, my little Homie Bear.

10:29.003 --> 10:30.546
Time for bed.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.715
Sing me my

10:32.798 --> 10:35.968

10:52.401 --> 10:54.445
Abe, isn't Homer cute?

10:54.528 --> 10:56.739
Probably. I'm trying
to watch the Super Bowl.

10:56.822 --> 10:59.116

it might not make it.

there's a haircut

11:37.655 --> 11:39.156
you could set your watch to.

11:39.240 --> 11:41.701
So Mother Simpson,
where did your newfound sense

11:41.784 --> 11:43.494
of irresponsibility
take you?

11:43.577 --> 11:45.246
I soon found people
who shared my views

11:45.329 --> 11:47.790

Hey, hey, Mr. Burns

12:01.721 --> 12:03.681
enough already with the germs.

12:03.764 --> 12:08.269
Their flower power is
no match for my glower power.

12:08.352 --> 12:09.478
Ooh!

12:12.231 --> 12:14.817
That's some
nice glowering, Mr. B.

12:25.578 --> 12:26.787
It could be a late night.

12:26.871 --> 12:28.247
I'm meeting my destiny.

12:37.715 --> 12:39.175

12:39.258 --> 12:41.844

to be history, man.

12:41.927 --> 12:43.179

12:43.262 --> 12:45.806

12:45.890 --> 12:47.183

They never harmed a soul.

13:23.761 --> 13:24.804
They never even had a chance.

13:24.887 --> 13:26.138
Whoever did this

13:26.222 --> 13:27.723

14:14.687 --> 14:15.688
I'll miss you, Homer.

14:19.817 --> 14:21.902
I thought I dreamed that kiss.

14:21.986 --> 14:24.363

14:24.446 --> 14:26.907
I'm so sorry
I misjudged you, Mom.

14:26.991 --> 14:29.201
You had to leave
to protect your family.

14:29.285 --> 14:30.828
How did you survive?

14:30.911 --> 14:33.080
Oh, I had help from
my friends in the underground.

14:33.163 --> 14:34.748
Jerry Rubin
gave me a job

14:34.832 --> 14:36.709
marketing his line
of health shakes.

14:36.792 --> 14:38.752
I proofread Bobby
Seale's cookbook

14:38.836 --> 14:40.170
and I ran credit checks

14:40.254 --> 14:41.630
at Tom Hayden's
Porsche dealership.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.173
Wait a minute.

14:43.257 --> 14:45.217
There's one thing
I don't understand.

14:45.301 --> 14:48.596
In all those years, why didn't
you ever try to contact me?

14:48.679 --> 14:49.972
But I did.

14:50.055 --> 14:51.891
I sent you a care package
every week.

14:51.974 --> 14:53.767
Aw come on, Mom.
We use that same line

14:53.851 --> 14:55.311
on the kids
when they're at camp.

14:55.394 --> 14:56.812
But I did. I really did.

14:56.896 --> 14:57.771
I'll prove it to you.

15:01.066 --> 15:02.985
Any undelivered mail
for Homer J. Simpson?

15:03.068 --> 15:05.529
No... oh, wait. This.

15:05.613 --> 15:07.281
That's what happens

15:07.364 --> 15:08.908
when you don't tip your
letter carrier at Christmas.

15:08.991 --> 15:10.367
Yes, I'd like to send
this letter

15:10.451 --> 15:12.912
to the Prussian consulate
in Siam by aeromail.

15:12.995 --> 15:15.164
Am I too late
for the 4:30 auto-gyro?

15:15.247 --> 15:17.541
Uh... I better look
in the manual.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.001
Oh, the ignorance.

15:21.545 --> 15:22.463
Wait a minute.

15:22.546 --> 15:24.381
I know that woman.

15:24.465 --> 15:25.382
But from when,

15:25.466 --> 15:27.968
and in what capacity?

15:28.052 --> 15:29.011
(gasping)

15:29.094 --> 15:30.012
It's her.

15:30.095 --> 15:31.138
At last.

15:31.221 --> 15:32.890
This book must
be out of date.

15:32.973 --> 15:35.893
I don't see Prussia,
Siam or auto-gyro.

15:35.976 --> 15:37.478
Well, keep looking.

15:37.561 --> 15:39.104
(gasps)

15:42.566 --> 15:44.944
Are you sure this is the woman
you saw in the Post Office?

15:45.027 --> 15:46.195
Absolutely.

15:46.278 --> 15:47.196
Who could forget
such a monstrous visage?

15:47.279 --> 15:48.530
She has the sloping brow

15:48.614 --> 15:50.908

15:50.991 --> 15:52.284
Uh, sir, phrenology
was dismissed

15:52.368 --> 15:53.911
as quackery
160 years ago.

15:53.994 --> 15:55.496
Of course,
you'd say that

15:57.957 --> 15:59.792
At any rate, the F.B.I.

16:05.881 --> 16:06.799
How does what
happen?

How does a sweet young lady

16:08.384 --> 16:11.011
mortgage her future for
a bunch of scraggly ideals

16:11.095 --> 16:13.180
and greasy-haired promises?

16:13.263 --> 16:14.932
Maybe she thought the war on
southeast Asia was so immoral

16:15.015 --> 16:16.350
her end justified the means.

16:16.433 --> 16:18.686
Gee, Joe, you haven't
been the same

16:18.769 --> 16:21.063

crazy in Vietnam.

16:21.146 --> 16:22.189

or tell him

18:32.986 --> 18:34.571
We're only now
finally caught up.

18:34.655 --> 18:37.449
Two more ladies come by
earlier that day.

18:37.533 --> 18:40.744
One was real pretty.

18:40.828 --> 18:42.496
T'other, sort of plain.

18:45.207 --> 18:46.625
Ma'am, we're going to need
your assistance

18:46.708 --> 18:47.918
in locating this individual.

18:48.001 --> 18:51.547
(chuckling)
Oh, you're fresh.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.799
Don't you want to play
"good cop, bad cop"?

18:53.882 --> 18:55.092
Ma'am, we're all good cops.

18:55.175 --> 18:57.636
I had no intention
of playing the good cop.

18:57.719 --> 18:58.929
(chuckles)

18:59.012 --> 19:00.180
Ew.

19:00.264 --> 19:01.723
Look, we know
you bought the tombstone.

19:01.807 --> 19:03.600
We know the fugitive
visited that tombstone.

19:03.684 --> 19:05.769
Whose tombstone was it?

19:05.853 --> 19:08.730
Just lift up
your coffee cups and see.

19:08.814 --> 19:10.315
(gasps)

19:10.399 --> 19:12.025
Good Lord.

19:12.109 --> 19:16.780
Put out an A.P.B.
On a "Uosdwis R. Dewoh."

19:16.864 --> 19:18.574
Uh, better start
with Greektown.

19:18.657 --> 19:19.741
That's Homer J. Simpson,
Chief.

19:19.825 --> 19:20.993
You're reading it
upside down.

19:21.076 --> 19:23.412
Uh, cancel that A.P.B.

19:23.495 --> 19:26.123
But bring back some
of them, uh, gyros.

19:26.206 --> 19:27.875
Uh, Chief, you're talking
into your wallet.

19:29.209 --> 19:30.836
Grandma, have you
ever thought

19:30.919 --> 19:32.212
about moving back
to Springfield?

19:32.296 --> 19:33.839
You could live
with Grampa again.

19:33.922 --> 19:36.216
(laughter)

19:39.761 --> 19:41.471
Oh, I'm a living joke.

19:41.555 --> 19:42.848
You know, Lisa...

19:42.931 --> 19:44.016
(phone rings)

19:44.099 --> 19:46.185
it might be nice
to rest for a while.

19:46.268 --> 19:47.603
Mom?

19:47.686 --> 19:49.021
There's nothing to be
alarmed about,

19:49.104 --> 19:51.440
but could you take one
last look at the family

19:51.523 --> 19:52.524
and join me in the kitchen?

19:55.485 --> 19:59.656
I've been waiting 25 years
for this moment.

19:59.740 --> 20:02.868
("Ride of the Valkyries"
playing)

20:02.951 --> 20:04.119
("Waterloo"
playing)

20:07.998 --> 20:10.000
I'm sorry, sir.
I must have taped over that.

20:10.083 --> 20:13.587

20:15.380 --> 20:16.298
Freeze.

20:16.381 --> 20:17.716
F.B.I.
The jig is up.

20:17.799 --> 20:19.009
All right, I admit it!

20:19.092 --> 20:21.053
I am the Lindbergh baby.

20:21.136 --> 20:22.721
Wah-wah. Goo, goo.

20:22.804 --> 20:24.556
I miss my fly-fly da-da.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.683
Are you trying to stall us,
or are you just senile?

20:26.767 --> 20:29.519
A little from column "a,"
a little from column "b."

20:29.603 --> 20:31.271
(panting)
Sir...

20:31.355 --> 20:32.356
she's gone.

20:36.902 --> 20:38.654
We made it, Homer.

20:38.737 --> 20:40.864
It's all thanks
to our anonymous tipster.

20:40.948 --> 20:44.076
But who are you
and why did you tip us off?

20:44.159 --> 20:46.245
<i>Well, it's 'cause of your</i>
<i>old lady that I got rid</i>

20:46.328 --> 20:48.747
<i>of the asthma that was</i>
<i>keeping me out of the academy.</i>

20:48.830 --> 20:50.082
Thanks.

20:50.165 --> 20:52.542
Sure. Just think of me
as an anonymous friend

20:52.626 --> 20:55.212
who rose through the ranks
of the Springfield Police

20:55.295 --> 20:56.838
to become
Chief Clancy Wig...

20:56.922 --> 20:57.923

20:58.006 --> 20:59.508
Yak, yak, yak,
yak, yak.

21:02.010 --> 21:02.928
(horn beeping)

21:03.011 --> 21:04.846
Well, there's my ride.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.890
The underground awaits.

21:06.974 --> 21:10.269
(sniffling) At least this time
I'm awake for your good-bye.

21:10.352 --> 21:12.771
(sniffing)
Oh, Homer.

21:12.854 --> 21:14.898
Remember: whatever happens,

21:14.982 --> 21:16.191
you have a mother

21:16.275 --> 21:18.568
and she's truly
proud of you.

21:21.071 --> 21:23.115
Oh...

21:23.198 --> 21:25.450
Oh! Hurry up, man.

21:25.534 --> 21:28.495
This electric van only has
20 minutes of juice left.

21:30.205 --> 21:31.790
Don't forget me.

21:31.873 --> 21:32.916
Don't worry, Homer.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.043
You'll always be a part of me.
