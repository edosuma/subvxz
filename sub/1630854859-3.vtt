Over and over,

14:01.740 --> 14:04.060
you told me how you never
wanted to have a family.

14:04.260 --> 14:05.810
That you could never be a father

14:06.010 --> 14:08.810

you'd be like your own.

14:09.010 --> 14:12.070
Don't take my past
and use it to justify

14:12.270 --> 14:14.810

14:15.010 --> 14:17.470

my confiding in you

14:17.670 --> 14:19.780

about my fears--

14:19.980 --> 14:21.690

14:21.890 --> 14:24.860

of my life.

14:52.140 --> 14:54.670
have been my father.

20 years before.

15:05.860 --> 15:07.950
When Jack was on his way,

15:08.150 --> 15:10.390
I was terrified.

15:10.590 --> 15:12.480
All I knew

15:12.680 --> 15:15.270
was that if you're the son

15:15.470 --> 15:18.750
of Jean-Luc Picard,
there's a target on your back.

15:18.950 --> 15:20.920

I've always found one thing
to be true:

disappointing the reality.

27:28.240 --> 27:31.080
and stop them.

27:39.960 --> 27:41.870
Cool.

27:46.570 --> 27:49.720
PICARD:
Vadic should be
as blind as we are.

27:49.920 --> 27:52.410
It might give us
a tactical advantage.

27:52.610 --> 27:55.200
No, we should continue to evade
until warp is operational.

27:55.400 --> 27:57.030
She's finding us anyway.

27:57.230 --> 28:00.250
Engineering is now estimating
just under 20 minutes, sir.

28:00.450 --> 28:04.600
So, only defensive strategy.

28:04.800 --> 28:06.600
Given our limit,

28:06.800 --> 28:09.300
and what we've seen
of her capabilities, yes.

28:09.500 --> 28:12.260
But given the likelihood
that we are forced

28:12.460 --> 28:13.650
to re-engage...

28:13.850 --> 28:16.350
[sighs]
This isn't the <i>Enterprise.</i>

28:16.550 --> 28:17.920
What I've seen,
the difference between

28:18.120 --> 28:19.440
the <i>Titan</i>and the <i>Shrike--</i>

28:19.640 --> 28:21.790
the only option we really have
is to hide.

28:21.990 --> 28:25.090
Of course, I'm...
I'm open to your input.

28:26.530 --> 28:28.570
Thank you, Captain.

28:31.530 --> 28:34.280
RIKER:
La Forge, keep us squirrelly

28:34.480 --> 28:37.800
- and hidden long enough
to buy us time.
- Yes, Captain.

28:47.420 --> 28:49.170
Almost there.

28:49.370 --> 28:51.300
We're gonna get you scanned.
Here we go.

28:51.500 --> 28:54.260
Hey, look at me.
Look at me.

28:54.460 --> 28:57.390
You're gonna be okay.
All right?

28:57.590 --> 28:58.920
You may have lost
a bit of blood,

28:59.110 --> 29:01.610
but here's some good news:
we got plenty.

29:01.810 --> 29:03.830
So you're gonna be
absolutely fine, I promise.

29:04.030 --> 29:05.440
- Thank you.
- Okay?

29:05.640 --> 29:07.620
- Yeah.
- Let's get you over this way.

29:07.820 --> 29:10.450
Captain?
Captain, stay with me.

29:10.650 --> 29:12.450
- Captain.
- [gasping]

29:12.650 --> 29:15.450
- What can I do to help?
- Help with the others.

29:15.650 --> 29:16.630
They're fine.
They're stable.

29:16.830 --> 29:18.200
I don't like what
I'm seeing here.

29:18.390 --> 29:20.710
Shaw, are you having
trouble breathing?

29:22.670 --> 29:25.720
Does this hurt?
What about this?

29:25.920 --> 29:27.070
- Now.
- [pained gasp]

29:27.270 --> 29:29.550
He's bleeding internally.

29:29.750 --> 29:31.640
No. I ran the imaging scan.

29:31.840 --> 29:33.340
Imaging doesn't always pick up
delayed bleeding

29:33.540 --> 29:35.340
from concussive injuries.
We need to work on this.

29:35.540 --> 29:37.910
Jack.

29:38.110 --> 29:41.730
- Get him on his side. Go.
- [Shaw groans]

29:45.430 --> 29:49.180
How-how is she finding us?

29:49.380 --> 29:51.270
I'm so sorry, sir.

29:51.470 --> 29:54.710
I never meant
for any of this to happen.

29:54.910 --> 29:58.570
How does she keep
finding us?

30:13.460 --> 30:16.170
- Stern, report.
<i>- VESCO: Still no sign of her.</i>

30:16.370 --> 30:18.290
- Warp status?
- Less than ten, sir.

30:22.730 --> 30:25.390
Science, have you been tracking

30:25.590 --> 30:27.130
- these energy pulses?
- Yes, sir.

30:27.330 --> 30:30.010
I'm reading both electrical
and biological signatures.

30:30.210 --> 30:31.880
I don't believe that
this is a nebula,

30:32.080 --> 30:35.230
but some kind of
unknown anomaly.

30:35.430 --> 30:36.580
There's been nothing like it

30:36.780 --> 30:38.410
ever reported by Starfleet.

30:38.610 --> 30:41.670
So, going straight through it
is not a recommended option?

30:41.870 --> 30:44.890
Definitely not, sir.

30:45.090 --> 30:46.200
Are you suggesting
we turn back?

30:46.400 --> 30:49.200
Logic suggests
it would be unwise

30:49.400 --> 30:50.450
to go any deeper.

30:59.460 --> 31:01.300
La Forge, change course.

31:01.500 --> 31:02.950
Inform Engineering
however long it takes

31:03.150 --> 31:05.560
to get us outside this nebula
is exactly how much time

31:05.760 --> 31:07.770
they have to be ready to warp.

31:09.990 --> 31:12.090
<i>All hands, remain</i>
<i>at battle stations</i>

31:12.290 --> 31:14.440
<i>and prepare for maximum warp.</i>

31:14.640 --> 31:16.880
<i>- We'll attempt to outrun</i>
<i>the</i>Shrike.
- I have to get to the bridge.

31:17.080 --> 31:20.570
- I need to speak with them.
- We're at red alert.
Turn around.

31:41.070 --> 31:42.860
Sir, I estimate
we're moments away from

31:43.060 --> 31:44.080
approaching the outer edge.

31:44.280 --> 31:45.860
Engineering says warp is a go.

31:46.060 --> 31:47.870
Set course
for the nearest starbase.

31:48.070 --> 31:50.520
Comms, ready an emergency SOS,

31:50.720 --> 31:52.180
then prepare to go to warp.

31:52.370 --> 31:54.390
T'VEEN:
Effects of the nebula
dissipating.

31:54.590 --> 31:56.660
Soon as we're clear, La Forge.

31:56.860 --> 31:58.350
MURA:
Scanners are coming on line.

32:06.700 --> 32:07.840
Sir, she's on us.

32:08.040 --> 32:10.710
Ready the device.

32:14.140 --> 32:16.550
Their weapons systems...
My God.

32:16.750 --> 32:18.510
They're giving off
energy readings like...

32:18.710 --> 32:21.330
like nothing
I've ever seen before.

32:21.530 --> 32:22.670
Fire!

32:29.640 --> 32:31.170
RIKER:
What the hell is that?

32:31.370 --> 32:32.420
SIDNEY:
Sir, we're going right through.

32:45.350 --> 32:47.880
SIDNEY:
She's pulled us deeper
into the nebula.

32:48.080 --> 32:49.360
MURA:
Some kind of portal weapon, sir.

32:49.560 --> 32:51.930
Dimensional folding,
interspatial singularity.

32:52.130 --> 32:54.790
La Forge, punch it.
Try it again.

33:08.850 --> 33:10.070
Again.

33:34.440 --> 33:36.580
- SIDNEY: Sir, she's pulled us
back in again.
- Damn it.

33:36.780 --> 33:40.110
Will, she's corralling us,
holding us in the air

33:40.310 --> 33:41.890
so that she
or that energy surge

33:42.090 --> 33:44.810
can cripple us
until we're defenseless.

33:45.010 --> 33:47.800
Now is the time to fight.

33:54.330 --> 33:56.200
Turn us around,
take us back in.

34:15.180 --> 34:17.060
<i>[laughing]</i>

34:17.260 --> 34:19.230
[indistinct chatter]

34:36.590 --> 34:38.650
I told you to stay back.

34:38.850 --> 34:41.000
<i>WORF [over comm]:</i>
<i>It is not in my nature</i>
<i>to stay back.</i>

34:41.200 --> 34:44.040
<i>Also, you look conspicuous</i>
<i>in that hood.</i>

34:44.240 --> 34:46.000
Says the Klingon
in warrior gear.

34:46.200 --> 34:49.790
It is not warrior gear.
It is casual.

34:49.990 --> 34:52.400
Seriously,
where do you wear that--

34:52.600 --> 34:53.790
to a Tuesday beheading?

34:53.990 --> 34:55.450
Welcome.
You are now entering...

34:55.640 --> 34:57.880
I'm glad to see that
you are feeling better.

34:58.080 --> 35:00.750
I'm not. I just bring it
when the moment calls.

35:04.620 --> 35:05.930
It is calling.

35:06.130 --> 35:08.540
<i>Behind you!</i>

35:17.890 --> 35:21.650
<i>Rafaella,</i>
<i>we have been discovered.</i>

35:21.840 --> 35:23.170
<i>He is getting away.</i>

35:23.370 --> 35:24.340
Which way?

35:24.540 --> 35:26.780
<i>On your right.</i>

35:26.980 --> 35:28.220
<i>- RAFFI: I see him.</i>
<i>- WORF: Take the alley.</i>

35:28.420 --> 35:30.730
<i>By the stall, now.</i>

35:35.220 --> 35:37.040
I'm losing him.

35:44.570 --> 35:46.140
[crowd exclaims]

35:49.530 --> 35:51.360
Beheadings are on Wednesdays.

35:56.630 --> 35:58.150
[grunting]

36:00.110 --> 36:02.940
[alarm blaring]

36:19.960 --> 36:21.310
Sir, I can't shake her.

36:21.510 --> 36:23.190
The <i>Shrike</i>keeps
pushing us deeper.

36:23.380 --> 36:24.970
We're running out of chances
here, Captain.

36:25.170 --> 36:28.050
I am well aware.

36:31.530 --> 36:33.580
[door chiming]

36:34.930 --> 36:37.150
[knock on door]

36:39.890 --> 36:43.200
- What are you doing here?
- We need a word.
- Hey, you...

36:45.980 --> 36:48.210
You were a Fenris Ranger, right?

36:48.410 --> 36:50.950
- [scoffs]
I don't have time for this.
- Blood in the water.

36:51.150 --> 36:52.610
Come on, oldest trick
in the book.

36:52.810 --> 36:55.040
Blood in the water.

36:55.240 --> 36:56.830
That's how the <i>Shrike</i>
keeps finding us.

36:57.030 --> 36:58.870
Somehow,

36:59.070 --> 37:01.750
we're leaving
a trail of breadcrumbs.

37:01.940 --> 37:04.920
Now, you know there's any number
of things that can do this.

37:05.120 --> 37:07.190
Invisible, subtle,

37:07.390 --> 37:09.800
and easily detectable
by enemy ships.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.930
There's no need for long-range
sensors, only a...

37:12.130 --> 37:13.840
Mass spectrometer.

37:14.040 --> 37:17.280
Verterium.
It insulates the warp coils.

37:17.480 --> 37:20.670
Yes! Yes, that's-that's it.
That's what I'm saying.

37:22.760 --> 37:24.370
We have a leak.

37:27.070 --> 37:30.940
We have to be sure.
Come with me.

37:32.810 --> 37:35.340
Sorry, Commander, the captain's
orders still stand.

37:35.540 --> 37:36.690
You're confined to quarters

37:36.890 --> 37:37.820
and I can't allow you
to leave.

37:38.020 --> 37:40.730
Yeah, the thing about that is...

37:44.820 --> 37:46.430
You're insane.

37:52.790 --> 37:54.140
[grunting]

37:58.270 --> 38:00.850
Oh. Gas leak.
Smells like verterium.

38:01.050 --> 38:03.020
Here. It's poisonous
in gaseous form.

38:03.220 --> 38:05.240
- Exposure will kill you.
- [coughs]

38:05.440 --> 38:06.680
JACK:
Well, the way things
have been going lately,

38:06.880 --> 38:08.460
it might need to join
the queue.

38:10.670 --> 38:12.420
SEVEN OF NINE:
Someone deactivated
atmospheric diagnostics.

38:12.620 --> 38:14.980
The ship's computer
can't detect the leak.

38:19.810 --> 38:21.960
[gas hissing]

38:22.160 --> 38:24.390
JACK:
Looks like short-range
phaser fire to me.

38:24.590 --> 38:27.080
SEVEN OF NINE:
It's not damage, it's sabotage.

38:32.440 --> 38:34.660
There's still a lot
in this room and the tube.

38:34.860 --> 38:36.360
I'm gonna check another chamber.
Stay here.

38:36.560 --> 38:37.970
We need to know how long
it'll take to clear the system.

38:38.170 --> 38:39.630
Hansen to bridge.

38:39.830 --> 38:41.450
<i>We know how the</i>Shrike's
<i>been following us.</i>

38:41.650 --> 38:42.980
<i>We're leaking verterium.</i>

38:43.180 --> 38:45.630
<i>Someone did this on purpose.</i>

38:45.830 --> 38:47.850
We have a saboteur.

38:48.050 --> 38:50.290
T'VEEN:
Captain, we're getting too close

38:50.490 --> 38:52.420
to the center of this nebula,
and by quick estimate,

38:52.620 --> 38:55.080
a strong, sizeable
inner gravitational well.

38:55.280 --> 38:56.820
If we get pulled into it...

38:57.020 --> 38:58.510
You heard her, La Forge.

38:58.710 --> 39:00.550
Aye, Captain.

39:03.550 --> 39:06.300
Will, if this was sabotage,

39:06.500 --> 39:08.260
we can use it
to our own advantage.

39:08.460 --> 39:10.310
- As a diversion.
- Yes.

39:10.510 --> 39:14.360
Stop the leak, create a dead end
to the <i>Shrike's</i>trail.

39:14.560 --> 39:16.490
Pivot hard, race out of here.

39:16.690 --> 39:19.670
No. Use it to set a trap.

39:19.870 --> 39:21.800
Instead of fleeing,
we end the trail

39:22.000 --> 39:24.630
and reposition
behind the <i>Shrike.</i>

39:24.830 --> 39:26.410
We'll have her dead to rights.

39:26.610 --> 39:29.200
It makes tactical sense
but, no, you said it earlier--

39:29.400 --> 39:32.370
we can no longer risk
the lives of this crew.

39:32.570 --> 39:33.770
As soon as the leak is fixed,

39:33.970 --> 39:35.200
we're gonna make
a final run for it.

39:35.400 --> 39:38.120
Tell Engineering
to prepare for warp again.

39:38.320 --> 39:40.950
This leak gives us
only one advantage:

39:41.150 --> 39:44.040
she doesn't know that we know
that we're being tracked.

39:44.240 --> 39:45.910
I understand, you're amped up,
you have a son on board

39:46.110 --> 39:47.650
- and it's affecting...
- Will, why?!

39:47.850 --> 39:49.260
I'm taking this ship

39:49.460 --> 39:52.210
and her crew home.

40:05.270 --> 40:07.020
JACK:
You can't be in here,
there's a leak...

40:07.220 --> 40:09.240
- [grunting]
<i>- COMPUTER: Warning.</i>

RAFFI:
I'm having a real hard time
balancing the whole

40:47.780 --> 40:51.060
work/life thing.

40:51.260 --> 40:53.240
And then you decided to help

40:53.440 --> 40:56.670
get 117 people killed.

40:58.540 --> 41:02.380
I'm gonna start pulling off
your fingernails,

41:02.580 --> 41:04.890
just to make me feel better.

41:06.550 --> 41:08.470
Why are you already sweating?

41:08.670 --> 41:10.910
Raffaela.

41:11.110 --> 41:13.340
You may keep your fingernails.

41:13.540 --> 41:15.960
We know that those deaths
were not your fault.

41:16.160 --> 41:17.780
Oh, hell no.

41:17.980 --> 41:19.780
He is not getting off
that easy.

41:21.080 --> 41:23.090
Have you ever seen
how far a Klingon warrior

41:23.290 --> 41:27.750
- can shove a sword
up someone's...
- I do not do that anymore.

41:27.950 --> 41:29.610
I am wiser now.

41:33.530 --> 41:35.110
I was once like her.

41:35.300 --> 41:36.670
