(tranquil music playing)

00:50.400 --> 00:52.367
(timer rings)

01:04.467 --> 01:06.266
I'm not happy with my zabagliones.

01:06.333 --> 01:09.233
Maybe you just need
a push-up bra.

01:13.333 --> 01:16.867
Blanche, zabaglione
is a traditional Italian dessert.

01:16.934 --> 01:18.467
It's my uncle Angelo's favorite.

01:18.533 --> 01:19.400
Yeah. My brother,

01:19.467 --> 01:23.000
he's quite the scungisko-ror-ror.

01:23.066 --> 01:24.934
Even I don't know that one.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.066
That wasn't a word.
My dentures slipped.

01:29.367 --> 01:32.500
Ma, uncle Angelo's
plane lands at 4:00.

01:32.567 --> 01:35.166
You have time to make a fresh batch
before then.

01:35.233 --> 01:37.500
Good. These aren't fit
for human consumption.

01:37.567 --> 01:39.567
Top of the morning, sunshines.

01:39.633 --> 01:42.867
Hey, Rose, try one of these.

01:43.734 --> 01:44.734
Oh, no, thanks.

01:44.800 --> 01:46.800
I'm doing what we all
should be doing...

01:46.867 --> 01:49.600
dieting for the bachelorette auction
next Saturday.

01:49.667 --> 01:50.667
Not all of us.

01:50.734 --> 01:52.500
I told you, Rose, count me out.

01:52.567 --> 01:54.367
Even if it's for charity,

01:54.433 --> 01:58.600
I won't stand up there and allow myself
to be sold to the highest bidder

01:58.667 --> 02:02.700
like some Holstein cow
at a livestock auction.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
Dorothy, livestock don't get
chauffeur-driven limousine rides

02:08.066 --> 02:10.066
to fancy four-star restaurants

02:10.133 --> 02:12.300
and the symphony afterwards,

02:12.367 --> 02:16.100
except during St. Olaf
bicentennial day.

02:17.033 --> 02:18.734
Rose, I am not going.

02:18.800 --> 02:19.934
It is degrading.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Don't be a stick in the mud.

02:22.066 --> 02:23.667
It's for the children's hospital.

02:23.734 --> 02:26.600
If you can't degrade yourself
for sick kids,

02:26.667 --> 02:29.400
who can you degrade yourself for?

02:29.467 --> 02:32.300
Listen to this...
Eleanor Roosevelt in a garter belt.

02:33.834 --> 02:35.467
Dorothy, now, you can't tell us

02:35.533 --> 02:37.967
that a part of you
isn't a little excited.

02:38.033 --> 02:40.433
Remember last year's auction?

02:40.500 --> 02:41.767
That rush of euphoria

02:41.834 --> 02:43.934
when the auctioneer calls out "Sold!"

02:44.000 --> 02:46.567
And you fall into the arms
of your Galahad.

02:46.633 --> 02:51.100
My Galahad was a
balloon salesman named Sid.

02:52.066 --> 02:53.233
(Blanche)
Well, hey.

02:53.300 --> 02:57.166
Who knew that sawed-off little gnome
would outbid a navy admiral

02:57.233 --> 02:59.867
and the fire chief and that jeweler

02:59.934 --> 03:02.300
who was a dead ringer
for Richard Widmark?

03:02.367 --> 03:03.800
That was a year ago.

03:03.867 --> 03:05.233
How do you remember this?

03:05.300 --> 03:08.400
I tagged them for migratory purposes.

03:09.734 --> 03:13.467
Dorothy, come on. The auction needs you.
The children need you.

03:13.533 --> 03:15.166
Please. Won't you reconsider?

03:15.233 --> 03:18.333
Oh, all right. It's only one night.

03:18.400 --> 03:21.100
I'll go. But I'll tell you,
I really hate this.

03:21.166 --> 03:24.467
Oh, that balloon man
couldn't have been that terrible.

03:24.533 --> 03:25.667
I got the feeling

03:25.734 --> 03:28.967
I was the man's first date
that wasn't inflatable.

03:32.600 --> 03:34.200
Hey, I have an idea.

03:34.266 --> 03:36.467
Dorothy just did something
really nice for us.

03:36.533 --> 03:38.867
Let's do something nice for her.

03:38.934 --> 03:40.800
Why don't we buy her a man?

03:40.867 --> 03:42.867
I'm in. I know just the person.

03:42.934 --> 03:44.700
Free every Saturday night.

03:44.767 --> 03:46.433
Oh, wait. That's a woman.

03:47.266 --> 03:49.100
Oh, wait. That's Dorothy.

03:51.433 --> 03:52.834
I meant for the auction,

03:52.900 --> 03:54.600
so she won't get stuck
with another loser.

03:54.667 --> 03:57.133
Rose, that's not a bad idea.

03:57.200 --> 03:59.700
We were all going
to donate money anyway.

03:59.767 --> 04:01.600
We'll chip in, say, $50

04:01.667 --> 04:03.333
and buy her the bull of the ball.

04:04.700 --> 04:07.233
Who do we know
who knows a man?

04:07.300 --> 04:09.033
You know hundreds of men.

04:09.100 --> 04:11.367
I know. I just like hearing it.

04:14.233 --> 04:15.533
(doorbell rings)

04:22.266 --> 04:23.600
Hiya, sweetie pie.
How you doing?

04:23.667 --> 04:25.800
Fine, cupcake.
Thanks for asking.

04:36.400 --> 04:37.533
(doorbell rings)

04:37.600 --> 04:39.367
(Stan) Dorothy, I know you're in there.

04:44.767 --> 04:46.934
You always could slam a door.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.100
That's one thing
I love about you.

04:48.166 --> 04:49.567
You flatter me.

04:51.734 --> 04:53.400
Wait, wait, Dorothy.

04:53.467 --> 04:54.367
I have to talk to you.

04:54.433 --> 04:56.266
This wouldn't happen
to be an apology

04:56.333 --> 04:58.500
for ruining our wedding, would it?

04:59.433 --> 05:02.667
No. Just something
I thought I'd tell you in person.

05:02.734 --> 05:05.266
Remember my uncle Morris?

05:05.333 --> 05:08.166
Dorothy, he died.

05:08.233 --> 05:10.700
-Boy, you smell good.
-Get away from me.

05:11.433 --> 05:12.867
No, no, no. You don't understand.

05:12.934 --> 05:14.333
Something wonderful has happened.

05:14.400 --> 05:15.333
In his will,

05:15.400 --> 05:18.367
uncle Morris left us
an apartment building jointly.

05:18.433 --> 05:19.300
We're partners.

05:19.367 --> 05:21.433
Don't you see, Dorothy?

05:21.500 --> 05:24.200
We'll be together,
and we'll have our own place.

05:24.266 --> 05:26.100
Oh, God,
he's proposing to her again.

05:26.166 --> 05:29.066
Will one of you raise
your standards, please?

05:29.734 --> 05:31.734
Sophia, I'm not proposing.

05:31.800 --> 05:35.633
I'm here because Dorothy and I
inherited an apartment building.

05:35.700 --> 05:38.367
It's not a big building,

05:38.433 --> 05:40.600
but she'll still clear a couple hundred
bucks a month.

05:40.667 --> 05:42.166
Dorothy, this is wonderful.

05:42.233 --> 05:45.800
With that kind of money, we can hire
a really good-looking gardener.

05:47.633 --> 05:50.900
Dorothy, it really does sound
like a great opportunity.

05:50.967 --> 05:53.200
I mean, on Stan's behalf,

05:53.266 --> 05:55.934
Charlie once made a lot of money
in business with a partner

05:56.000 --> 05:59.934
who was also a lousy, no-good,
underhanded, back-stabbing worm.

06:00.967 --> 06:02.500
Let me guess, Rose.

06:02.567 --> 06:08.066
Ivan Boesky Vanderfloovenhuven-
Meistergarbengerbenfleckmen.

06:08.133 --> 06:09.734
That's the louse.

06:12.633 --> 06:15.233
So, what do you say, babe?
Partners?

06:15.300 --> 06:16.500
Goodbye, Stan.

06:16.567 --> 06:18.834
Okay. I get the message.

06:19.433 --> 06:22.967
I guess I'm just not a person
you want in your life.

06:26.233 --> 06:29.133
3, 2, 1.

06:29.200 --> 06:30.266
Am I?

06:30.333 --> 06:31.600
Goodbye, Stan.

06:33.900 --> 06:35.700
Can you believe this guy?

06:35.767 --> 06:38.867
Like I would think for a minute
about being in business with him.

06:38.934 --> 06:42.600
Nonsense, Dorothy. You can't pass up
a chance to own real estate.

06:42.667 --> 06:45.533
(gasps) It's been a lifesaver for me.

06:45.600 --> 06:48.333
You get a bunch of saps to pay
your mortgage for you every month,

06:48.400 --> 06:51.867
while your equity just
rises higher and higher,

06:51.934 --> 06:53.700
while those poor suckers...

07:04.567 --> 07:06.834
What I meant was:

07:06.900 --> 07:09.567
It's a great opportunity
to make new friends.

07:13.333 --> 07:15.533
(tranquil music playing)

07:18.200 --> 07:20.300
Look who's here.

07:20.367 --> 07:23.367
<i>Buon giorno, buon giorno, Rosa.</i>

07:23.433 --> 07:25.100
Ah, Blanche.

07:25.166 --> 07:27.100
Oh, my goodness.

07:27.166 --> 07:30.233
I haven't been hugged
so much since V-E day,

07:30.300 --> 07:31.700
which was kind of tricky

07:31.767 --> 07:34.233
because, as you know, we lost.

07:35.133 --> 07:38.734
Angelo, you're even handsomer
than you were your last visit.

07:38.800 --> 07:40.867
Thank you. I been plucking.

07:40.934 --> 07:43.867
See? I got two eyebrows now.

07:45.934 --> 07:47.533
Everybody loves them.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.333
You sit down here, Angelo.

07:49.400 --> 07:50.767
I got a surprise for you...

07:50.834 --> 07:53.066
Zabaglione, your favorite.

07:53.133 --> 07:54.433
Ah.

07:54.500 --> 07:56.166
Mmm.

07:58.700 --> 08:00.734
Oh, Sophia.

08:00.800 --> 08:03.066
And that's the new batch.

08:05.467 --> 08:06.767
I'm sorry.

08:06.834 --> 08:08.500
I cannot pretend no more.

08:08.567 --> 08:10.233
Uncle Angelo, what's wrong?

08:10.300 --> 08:12.900
It's a long, sad story.

08:12.967 --> 08:15.567
A story of love,
a story of deception.

08:15.633 --> 08:17.300
A story of a fool.

08:17.367 --> 08:21.400
You know the story
of Elsie Holdenfelder?

08:23.467 --> 08:24.667
Absolutely, Rose.

08:24.734 --> 08:28.633
That one's even more popular in Europe
than it is here.

08:30.100 --> 08:34.333
I met a beautiful young Sicilian
aerobics instructor...

08:34.400 --> 08:37.033
gorgeous eyes, angelic mouth,

08:37.100 --> 08:39.900
and a behind that must
have been made on Saturday

08:39.967 --> 08:44.667
because even God
would take a day off to admire it.

08:47.133 --> 08:49.433
I lost my heart,

08:49.500 --> 08:52.133
and I opened my wallet, eh?

08:52.200 --> 08:55.033
Oh, the expensive gifts
and fancy dinners

08:55.100 --> 08:57.934
and the weekends in Mikonos, eh?

08:58.033 --> 09:02.967
I even wore one of those
tiny Speedo swimsuits.

09:03.033 --> 09:06.066
Shows all your gingerbread
and everything, you know?

09:07.467 --> 09:09.033
And she leaves me.

09:09.967 --> 09:15.033
What has a 6'7" American
basketball player got that I don't?

09:15.100 --> 09:18.300
Well, Angelo, speaking in terms
of the gingerbread alone--

09:18.367 --> 09:20.500
Blanche!

09:25.433 --> 09:27.033
Go ahead, uncle Angelo.

09:27.100 --> 09:27.834
Anyway,

09:27.900 --> 09:30.233
I spend so much money on this girl,

09:30.300 --> 09:31.500
I forget about my business.

09:31.567 --> 09:34.166
The bank forecloses,
leaving me flat broke.

09:34.233 --> 09:37.500
I got no savings, no place to live,

09:38.567 --> 09:40.700
and I got to tell you...

09:40.767 --> 09:43.166
a lot of women find this a negative.

09:46.166 --> 09:48.533
It's a family curse,
this obsession with women.

09:48.600 --> 09:49.967
Men in our family,

09:50.033 --> 09:52.000
why couldn't they be
like cousin Anthony?

09:52.066 --> 09:55.867
Oh, Ma, cousin Anthony had an obsession
with men in cowboy hats

09:55.934 --> 09:58.533
who hung around Times Square.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.433
What will I do?

10:01.500 --> 10:03.066
You'll trust in your family.

10:03.133 --> 10:05.100
Family is there when you're down,

10:05.166 --> 10:07.400
and family stops
at nothing... nothing...

10:07.467 --> 10:08.734
to help one of their own.

10:08.800 --> 10:12.100
Blanche, I want Angelo
to come live with us.

10:12.166 --> 10:14.066
Oh, I'm sorry, Sophia.
There's just no room.

10:14.133 --> 10:15.300
Hey, I tried.

10:22.266 --> 10:23.667
Wait a minute, Dorothy.

10:23.734 --> 10:24.967
You're a landlord now.

10:25.033 --> 10:27.233
Maybe there's a vacancy
in your new building.

10:27.300 --> 10:28.934
Don't call it my building.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.300
I don't even know if I'll keep it.

10:31.367 --> 10:33.166
I understand.

10:33.767 --> 10:38.300
Sophia, any mail I get,
just address it...

10:38.367 --> 10:41.834
"Guy in the gutter.
Post office box anywhere."

10:42.667 --> 10:45.433
All right, all right.
All right, uncle Angelo.

10:45.500 --> 10:49.900
For the time being, I guess you can use
uncle Morris' old apartment.

10:49.967 --> 10:52.400
Oh, Dorothy.

10:52.467 --> 10:54.567
Thank you so much.

10:54.633 --> 10:57.533
My first apartment in America.

10:57.600 --> 10:59.667
Here I will begin again.

10:59.734 --> 11:03.266
Here I will start a new life.

11:03.934 --> 11:05.467
Dorothy, my new life,

11:05.533 --> 11:08.233
how close am I going
to start to the beach?

11:13.066 --> 11:15.033
(tranquil music playing)

11:16.266 --> 11:18.400
Going once...

11:18.467 --> 11:19.934
going twice...

11:20.000 --> 11:22.467
You still want to tell me
this isn't degrading?

11:22.533 --> 11:24.333
Don't be ridiculous.
It's for charity.

11:24.400 --> 11:25.867
Sold.

11:25.934 --> 11:27.433
For $4.00.

11:32.033 --> 11:35.700
Well, it's degrading
if you don't hit double figures.

11:35.767 --> 11:38.633
I really appreciate
your bidding on Dorothy.

11:38.700 --> 11:40.533
It's for a good cause.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.667
You'll be rewarded.

11:42.734 --> 11:44.367
Not in this lifetime.

11:46.233 --> 11:49.667
Variety is the watchword
for our next bachelorette...

11:49.734 --> 11:51.033
Dorothy Zbornak.

11:51.100 --> 11:52.433
Come on up, Dorothy.

11:55.333 --> 11:56.734
This is perfect.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.266
The way the bidding's going,

11:58.333 --> 12:01.000
we won't be out more than $30 apiece.

12:01.066 --> 12:04.133
"If Dorothy's not winging her way
to Molokai

12:04.200 --> 12:07.600
to assist Father Damien
in his work with the lepers,

12:07.667 --> 12:12.333
you can find her hang-gliding
high above the Florida keys."

12:12.934 --> 12:15.166
Rose, where did you get that?

12:15.233 --> 12:17.300
From your mother.

12:19.667 --> 12:23.300
Before she and I talked,
I wasn't aware of any of it.

12:23.967 --> 12:28.166
"She's a scratch golfer who,
under president Jimmy Carter,

12:28.233 --> 12:32.100
served as the United States senate
majority whip."

12:33.767 --> 12:35.834
"And she likes to read."

12:37.233 --> 12:39.300
I figured, close with the truth.

12:39.367 --> 12:42.233
It'll kind of anchor the rest.

12:42.300 --> 12:45.967
I want to thank you all
for holding this event on a night

12:46.033 --> 12:51.066
when my hang glider is in the shop
and congress is in recess

12:51.133 --> 12:54.266
and the lepers are on <i>Geraldo.</i>

12:55.633 --> 12:57.400
Go ahead, Rose.

12:57.467 --> 12:59.767
Right, Dorothy.

12:59.834 --> 13:03.133
All right. Now let's start
the bidding at...

13:03.200 --> 13:04.900
$5.00.

13:04.967 --> 13:06.233
$5.00.

13:06.300 --> 13:09.133
$100.

13:09.200 --> 13:11.900
Stanley, what are you
doing here?

13:11.967 --> 13:14.000
Buying a date with the woman I love.

13:14.066 --> 13:16.800
Oh, geez. Not in front of people.

13:19.600 --> 13:21.166
110.

13:21.233 --> 13:23.233
Didn't you give him a limit?

13:24.700 --> 13:25.533
200.

13:25.600 --> 13:28.200
Security, have this man removed.

13:28.266 --> 13:30.800
He's a lonely male impersonator.

13:32.533 --> 13:33.767
210.

13:33.834 --> 13:36.066
What? What is wrong with you?

13:36.133 --> 13:39.000
The woman's been with lepers!

13:43.266 --> 13:44.166
300.

13:44.233 --> 13:46.633
Stop it. I'm not going out with you.

13:46.700 --> 13:50.500
I'd rather be bound and gagged
and left on an ant hill

13:50.567 --> 13:51.767
covered with honey.

13:51.834 --> 13:53.300
400.

13:57.400 --> 13:59.100
410.

13:59.166 --> 14:00.467
Sold.

14:00.533 --> 14:02.100
Dorothy, I say that.

14:02.166 --> 14:03.567
-500.
-Sold.

14:03.633 --> 14:06.233
She says that!

14:07.000 --> 14:08.433
Rose, do something.

14:08.500 --> 14:09.867
Sold!

14:09.934 --> 14:11.233
Sorry, Dorothy.

14:11.300 --> 14:14.033
That's $500
for the children's hospital.

14:14.100 --> 14:16.800
I guess dreams really
can come true.

14:21.834 --> 14:25.266
(tranquil music playing)

14:26.867 --> 14:30.033
Dorothy, here's something that
will get your mind off Stan.

14:30.100 --> 14:32.967
According to my calculations,
allowing for overhead,

14:33.033 --> 14:36.867
tonight brought in
a grand total of $50.

14:36.934 --> 14:38.800
No, $500.

14:38.867 --> 14:41.400
5,000.

14:41.467 --> 14:42.867
50,000.

14:48.600 --> 14:50.433
It's 5,000, Rose.

14:50.500 --> 14:53.233
Decimal points don't have six legs.

14:54.500 --> 14:56.967
More than 10 percent of it
thanks to Dorothy here.

14:57.033 --> 14:59.133
Who's keeping score?

14:59.200 --> 15:01.200
What's important is that we made
a lot of money.

15:01.266 --> 15:03.367
I mean, together we made a...

15:03.433 --> 15:06.700
They were fighting over me,
did you see it?

15:06.767 --> 15:10.633
Well, Dorothy, to be fair,
one of them was Stan.

15:10.700 --> 15:14.000
Do I sense a tinge of envy there,

15:14.066 --> 15:18.233
Miss Going-going-gone-for-twenty-
five-fifty?

15:20.667 --> 15:23.133
You can't put a price tag
on beauty, Dorothy.

15:23.200 --> 15:24.667
Sure you can.

15:24.734 --> 15:26.800
Twenty-five.

15:31.667 --> 15:33.133
Oh, I'm sorry, Blanche.

15:33.200 --> 15:36.266
No, I'm not blaming
any of this on you.

15:36.333 --> 15:40.200
It's all my fault for giving Stan
so many chances.

15:40.266 --> 15:41.567
But I can't do this again.

15:41.633 --> 15:44.433
I mean, how many times
can I make the same mistake?

15:44.500 --> 15:47.600
How many times can you bang
your head against the wall

15:47.667 --> 15:49.200
before it starts to bleed?

15:49.266 --> 15:50.367
Nine.

15:54.300 --> 15:56.400
Believe me, Dorothy,
I know what you're going through.

15:56.467 --> 15:59.300
I once had a relationship
with a man I couldn't get rid of.

15:59.367 --> 16:03.834
Every time I turned around,
there he was.

16:03.900 --> 16:06.266
Long after I outgrew
my need for him,

16:06.333 --> 16:07.567
he was there

16:07.633 --> 16:10.633
with flowers and candy, perfume.

16:10.700 --> 16:14.233
I mean, I couldn't move without him
following me like a puppy dog.

16:14.300 --> 16:15.633
How'd you finally lose him?

16:15.700 --> 16:18.967
Monday came.
We both had to go back to work.

16:20.633 --> 16:22.200
Thank you, Blanche.

16:22.266 --> 16:24.533
-And thank you, too, Rose.
-What did I say?

16:24.600 --> 16:27.967
Nothing. I can't tell you
how much I appreciated it.

16:32.100 --> 16:34.400
Ah. Dorothy,

16:34.467 --> 16:37.066
I want to talk to you
about my apartment.

16:37.133 --> 16:39.800
I'm grateful. I love where I live.

16:39.867 --> 16:41.300
The last thing I want to do

16:41.367 --> 16:44.233
is come to you with every little problem.

16:44.300 --> 16:46.734
Now your mother
would like to talk to you.

16:48.767 --> 16:50.667
You're making my brother
live like a peasant.

16:50.734 --> 16:52.433
He has no closet space.

16:52.500 --> 16:55.066
You moved in with one suitcase.

16:55.133 --> 16:56.934
What do you need with more closets?

16:57.000 --> 16:59.467
I don't like to talk about
Angelo's personal life,

16:59.533 --> 17:03.967
but a man brings a woman home,
how is he supposed to play hide-and-seek?

17:07.233 --> 17:09.166
Under the table,
behind the couch.

17:09.233 --> 17:11.333
Bambi was onto me like that.

17:13.433 --> 17:15.066
Then there's the water pressure.

17:15.133 --> 17:18.100
I got more water pressure
than this apartment.

17:23.533 --> 17:25.667
-And another thing--
-Wait a minute.

17:25.734 --> 17:28.467
Why is any of this your business?

17:28.533 --> 17:30.567
-He's my brother.
-I'm your daughter.

17:30.633 --> 17:33.266
Dorothy, I've known you, what, 60 years?

17:33.333 --> 17:35.333
Angelo I've known 85.
To tell you the truth,

17:35.400 --> 17:37.000
I don't quite trust you yet.

17:39.166 --> 17:41.133
Uncle Angelo, in the past three days,

17:41.200 --> 17:44.734
you've complained about everything
in the apartment except the rent,

17:44.800 --> 17:46.867
reason being you don't pay any.

17:46.934 --> 17:49.800
I told you she'd throw it in our face.

17:49.867 --> 17:51.367
And speaking of complaints,

17:51.433 --> 17:54.266
what about that out-of-control
housewarming party

17:54.333 --> 17:57.266
that kept the other
tenants awake until dawn?

17:57.333 --> 18:00.266
The one I was not invited to?

18:00.333 --> 18:03.400
That wasn't a party,
just a quiet dinner for two.

18:03.467 --> 18:05.133
Hi there, Angelo.

18:05.200 --> 18:07.333
Rose and I are ready for our date.

18:07.400 --> 18:10.200
It's so sweet the way the mariachi band
chipped in

18:10.266 --> 18:12.433
to double date Rose and me.

18:12.500 --> 18:15.166
(car horn plays <i>La Cucaracha)</i>

18:15.233 --> 18:16.967
Here they are now.

18:17.033 --> 18:19.266
Angelo, great party
the other night.

18:19.333 --> 18:21.166
Yeah. You look great in a tux.

18:24.133 --> 18:26.700
It wasn't your kind of crowd, pussycat.

18:26.767 --> 18:27.767
That's funny.

18:27.834 --> 18:33.033
It's the same excuse you used when you
didn't invite me to my sweet 16.

18:33.100 --> 18:35.567
Now, that was a party.

18:35.633 --> 18:37.800
(doorbell rings)

18:43.467 --> 18:45.400
Hi. It's me, Stan.

18:45.467 --> 18:48.400
-From the fundraiser?
-I remember. Come on in.

18:48.467 --> 18:50.066
Uncle Angelo, Ma,
I hope you don't mind.

18:50.133 --> 18:52.734
Stan and I are going into the
kitchen and talk.

18:52.800 --> 18:55.800
Hey. Great party
the other night, Angelo.

18:59.400 --> 19:01.734
I appreciate you coming here tonight,

19:01.800 --> 19:04.333
but I'm not going out with you.

19:04.400 --> 19:05.467
But I won the bidding.

19:05.533 --> 19:09.200
I understand that, but nothing will
make me change my mind.

19:09.266 --> 19:10.133
You owe me $500.

19:10.200 --> 19:12.066
How about Thai food?

19:13.266 --> 19:14.266
Sounds great.

19:14.333 --> 19:15.533
Wait, wait, wait.

19:15.600 --> 19:17.233
I said I'm not going to go,

19:17.300 --> 19:19.066
and I'm not going to go.

19:19.133 --> 19:21.000
It's just that... well...

19:21.066 --> 19:23.600
you have different intentions
than I do.

19:23.667 --> 19:26.567
It's not my intentions.
It's God's intentions.

19:26.633 --> 19:29.400
Do you think this
is all a coincidence?

19:29.467 --> 19:30.500
I mean, look.

19:30.567 --> 19:32.934
Your uncle visits, my uncle dies.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
Your uncle needs a place to live,

19:35.066 --> 19:36.900
my uncle gives us a building.

19:36.967 --> 19:40.166
Don't you see?
God wants us to be together, babe.

19:40.233 --> 19:42.700
It's almost biblical.

19:43.400 --> 19:46.633
And thus he smote your uncle Morris, huh?

19:47.767 --> 19:50.867
One school of thought says
he's a wrathful God.

19:50.934 --> 19:52.967
Well, that would explain your hair.

19:55.333 --> 19:57.333
Stanley, pay attention.

19:57.400 --> 19:58.734
No date tonight.

19:58.800 --> 20:02.433
I guess I'll have to go through life
without you in it.

20:02.500 --> 20:06.667
I am in it. We're business partners.
That's the extent of it. Understand?

20:06.734 --> 20:08.600
Okay. Okay. I give up.

20:08.667 --> 20:11.200
Business partners. I understand.
Can we shake on it?

20:12.133 --> 20:15.400
I need you, Dorothy! I want you.

20:15.467 --> 20:18.000
Without you, I'm nothing.
Do you hear me? Nothing.

20:18.066 --> 20:22.767
Stan, as much of a turn-on as this is,
get off the floor.

20:23.633 --> 20:26.300
I belong on the floor
if I've driven you out of my life.

20:26.367 --> 20:29.367
From this moment on,
the floor's my home.

20:29.433 --> 20:30.567
Enjoy.

20:34.367 --> 20:36.367
-Dorothy.
-I can explain, Ma.

20:36.433 --> 20:37.600
No need to, pussycat.

20:37.667 --> 20:39.834
Let's move quick
before the cops get here.

20:40.834 --> 20:42.233
You wipe the fingerprints.

20:42.300 --> 20:44.633
I'll get a shovel
and a hefty bag.

20:45.900 --> 20:47.166
Sophia.

20:47.233 --> 20:49.033
It figures you couldn't finish the job.

20:49.100 --> 20:50.500
I'll go get the toaster.

20:54.633 --> 20:56.467
Ow! Ow! Ow!

20:56.533 --> 20:58.066
Sophia, I'm not dead.

20:58.133 --> 21:01.734
Not yet. Would you slow down?
I'm an old woman.

21:01.800 --> 21:04.834
Stan, I want no part of any of this.

21:04.900 --> 21:07.467
I'm out. I'm selling my half
of the building.

21:07.533 --> 21:11.233
Fine. I'll tear it down and put up
offices for Zbornak, incorporated.

21:11.300 --> 21:12.867
-Fine.
-Fine.

21:12.934 --> 21:15.600
It means throwing your uncle
out on the street.

21:15.667 --> 21:17.200
Stan, that's blackmail.

21:17.266 --> 21:20.066
But it's got a certain logic.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.734
So? Business partners?

21:23.433 --> 21:25.867
I have no choice.

21:25.934 --> 21:27.133
Business partners.

21:27.200 --> 21:29.367
-And dinner?
-Absolutely not.

21:29.433 --> 21:31.834
Stanley, you claim that you've changed.

21:31.900 --> 21:33.033
Well, so have I.

21:33.100 --> 21:38.333
Stan, I have finally come to realize
that no matter how hard you try,

21:38.400 --> 21:42.700
you cannot fix something
that no longer works.

21:42.767 --> 21:44.400
I've learned to let go, Stanley.

21:44.467 --> 21:46.233
-Dorothy--
-You should, too.

21:46.300 --> 21:48.633
I don't know if I can.

21:48.700 --> 21:51.734
If that guy at the auction
had bid $6 million for you,

21:51.800 --> 21:54.767
I would have come up
with 6,000,001.

21:57.367 --> 21:58.967
You're my girl, Dorothy.

21:59.033 --> 22:00.467
You always will be.

22:00.533 --> 22:03.333
But if you want me to go,
that's what I'll do.

22:04.800 --> 22:06.300
You know, pussycat--

22:08.266 --> 22:12.400
3... 2... 1.

22:23.934 --> 22:26.433
I can't believe it.

22:26.500 --> 22:28.066
He's not coming back.

22:28.133 --> 22:29.266
You okay?

22:29.333 --> 22:31.367
Yeah. I think I'm okay.

22:31.433 --> 22:33.200
No. I know I'm okay.

22:35.467 --> 22:37.266
You know, Ma, for the first time,

22:38.433 --> 22:40.033
I feel that it's over,

22:40.100 --> 22:43.266
that it's... really over.

22:44.166 --> 22:46.000
Dorothy, forgive me,

22:46.066 --> 22:48.333
but I got to speak.

22:48.400 --> 22:53.433
Sometimes it's harder to
close the door

22:53.500 --> 22:55.567
than to open a window.

22:59.967 --> 23:02.867
Oh, that's very wise,
uncle Angelo.

23:04.467 --> 23:05.667
Thank you.

23:11.333 --> 23:13.133
Actually I was talking
about the apartment,

23:13.200 --> 23:14.567
but I'll take wise.

23:23.633 --> 23:27.433
(theme music playing)
