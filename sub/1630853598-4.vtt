15:16.457 --> 15:19.710
Yeah, you're just mad that you got
your ass kicked by a floating cube!

15:19.793 --> 15:21.462
-[Klaus laughs]
-That's it. You're grounded.

15:21.545 --> 15:22.379
Why are you laughing?

15:22.463 --> 15:25.341
[Diego] You were conveniently absent
when all this shit went down.

15:25.424 --> 15:27.092
I was talking with Dad.

15:28.093 --> 15:29.219
Don't move an inch.

15:29.845 --> 15:30.679
[Klaus] Huh?

15:31.430 --> 15:33.474
-You ask him about the mother shit?
-Yeah.

15:33.974 --> 15:36.060
-What'd he say?
-That he didn't kill them.

15:36.143 --> 15:38.479
-Oh, you believe him?
-Well, I don't know. It's hard to say.

15:38.562 --> 15:41.857
The Sparrows have got him
all doped up like a… like a me!

15:41.941 --> 15:43.442
[Klaus chuckles]

15:43.525 --> 15:44.985
It doesn't alarm you at all,

15:45.069 --> 15:46.946
the fact that they're drugging
their father?

15:47.029 --> 15:49.865
Wish we would have thought of that.
Anything else?

15:51.075 --> 15:54.370
Oh, you know the luggage room
in the basement of the Academy

15:54.453 --> 15:56.330
where we used to huff paint?

15:56.413 --> 15:57.456
[Diego] Yeah, vaguely.

15:57.539 --> 15:58.832
Do you recall this

16:00.042 --> 16:02.211
blinding orb of light?

16:03.170 --> 16:04.588
-Now we're done.
-Huh?

16:10.344 --> 16:11.261
As requested.

16:16.141 --> 16:18.352
-[Stan] What the hell is this?
-Your punishment.

16:18.435 --> 16:19.728
And when you're done here,

16:19.812 --> 16:23.524
you're gonna clean every room
on Chet's list to pay for this shit, okay?

16:26.360 --> 16:29.655
And your Uncle Klaus
is gonna watch over you.

16:29.738 --> 16:32.241
-What? No! Please don't.
-What? No! Why can't you do it?

16:32.324 --> 16:35.536
Because I have to babysit Luther
in case Allison pops off again. Okay?

16:35.619 --> 16:37.788
All right, you two have tons in common.

16:37.871 --> 16:39.248
-No, we don't.
-Really? Like what?

16:39.331 --> 16:40.916
-Being a pain in my ass.
-Eat shit.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.710
-[Klaus] You're an asshat.
-Heard that.

16:50.426 --> 16:51.385
Okay.

16:57.182 --> 16:58.475
Okay. That's good.

16:58.559 --> 17:00.060
[broadcast warbling]

17:00.144 --> 17:02.646
There's been a rip
in the space-time continuum.

17:02.730 --> 17:04.565
It's swallowing everything.

17:05.232 --> 17:07.484
Oh, my sweet Dot, Iris,

17:07.568 --> 17:09.737
Josh from accounting, they're all gone.

17:09.820 --> 17:11.530
[audio garbles]

17:11.613 --> 17:14.616
I've tried everything!
I don't know what else to do.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.368
The timeline is collapsing.

17:16.452 --> 17:17.786
[yelps]

17:17.870 --> 17:18.746
Oh.

17:18.829 --> 17:20.956
[screaming in background]

17:21.623 --> 17:23.792
This is… the end.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.711
[screams]

17:30.132 --> 17:32.760
I could kill
for some scrambled eggs right now.

17:32.843 --> 17:36.597
-This is bigger than the timeline, Lila.
-What's bigger than the timeline?

17:36.680 --> 17:38.348
-The entire universe.
-Yeah.

17:38.432 --> 17:42.561
The missing dogs, people…
It's the opposite of the big bang.

17:42.644 --> 17:45.689
Instead of the universe expanding,
it's now collapsing in on itself.

17:45.773 --> 17:47.149
Like a prolapsing rectum.

17:48.400 --> 17:50.444
That's a weird analogy, but yeah.

17:51.111 --> 17:53.989
Here, then.
This might give us some answers.

17:55.282 --> 17:57.868
-[Five] Master handbook.
-The one and only.

18:00.204 --> 18:01.830
[pages rustling]

18:01.914 --> 18:02.831
Here we are.

18:03.457 --> 18:04.583
Okay, protocol.

18:04.666 --> 18:07.211
"In the unlikely case
of the grandfather paradox,

18:07.294 --> 18:10.547
the founder
and any essential personnel should--"

18:10.631 --> 18:13.675
[Lila] "…be immediately remanded
to the operations bunker."

18:15.636 --> 18:16.637
The founder.

18:17.137 --> 18:18.263
What founder?

18:18.347 --> 18:19.223
I don't know.

18:23.060 --> 18:24.311
We need to find that bunker…

18:24.394 --> 18:25.687
[in unison] ASAP.

18:25.771 --> 18:26.605
Jinx.

18:27.773 --> 18:30.609
[Lila] A-B-C-1-2-3, personal padlock.

18:30.692 --> 18:32.444
-[Five] Can you not--
-You can't speak!

18:33.237 --> 18:34.113
All right.

18:40.077 --> 18:41.411
I hate your family.

18:41.995 --> 18:45.040
That's cool.
Not a super fan of yours right now.

18:46.333 --> 18:48.752
-Were you part of it?
-Of what?

18:48.836 --> 18:51.839
-Ambushing us with Superman's grandpa.
-Sloane… [sighs]

18:51.922 --> 18:55.092
My family can't decide whether or not
to put mushrooms on a pizza.

18:55.175 --> 18:58.512
I have no idea who that old guy is.
He just showed up.

19:00.681 --> 19:02.558
You expect me to believe that?

19:02.641 --> 19:03.559
Hold on here.

19:04.518 --> 19:05.853
You attacked us.

19:05.936 --> 19:08.564
-I tried to warn you.
-Yeah, pfft, at the last second.

19:08.647 --> 19:10.858
-You almost took us out.
-Yeah, but we didn't.

19:10.941 --> 19:14.153
And your stupid family's fine,
and half of mine is dead.

19:18.115 --> 19:19.116
Were you just…

19:22.369 --> 19:23.412
using me?

19:24.663 --> 19:26.790
Getting close to gather information?

19:30.043 --> 19:31.670
Do you really believe that?

19:34.298 --> 19:35.465
[sighs]

19:37.801 --> 19:39.970
Sloane, you need to know
something about me.

19:42.598 --> 19:45.100
I don't really have any friends.

19:46.351 --> 19:48.729
Or… romances.

19:50.522 --> 19:52.316
I just have my family,

19:53.775 --> 19:56.445
and I would do anything to protect them

19:57.321 --> 19:59.031
except betray you

20:00.324 --> 20:02.242
because that's not who I wanna be.

20:03.327 --> 20:06.830
So, if you're playing me right now,

20:07.956 --> 20:08.957
you win.

20:10.167 --> 20:11.543
But if this…

20:12.836 --> 20:14.213
if this is for real,

20:15.756 --> 20:17.591
we have to trust each other

20:18.300 --> 20:20.302
because we're not our families.

20:30.312 --> 20:31.438
Okay.

20:34.483 --> 20:35.317
Okay.

20:37.027 --> 20:39.488
[sniffles]

20:49.539 --> 20:50.624
[gargles]

20:51.333 --> 20:52.209
Ahhh!

20:52.292 --> 20:53.460
[inhales sharply, belches]

20:53.543 --> 20:54.670
Ugh.

20:55.545 --> 20:57.214
Hey, you missed a spot.

20:57.297 --> 20:59.424
You missed a spot on your face,
and I'm not complaining.

20:59.508 --> 21:01.426
Hey, hey, hey. Listen to me, buddy.

21:01.510 --> 21:05.264
This is nothing compared
to what I endured when I was your age.

21:05.347 --> 21:08.809
You know he once gave me
six months' laundry duty. Six months!

21:09.393 --> 21:13.188
Just for pawning one of his
stupid priceless artifacts from Mexico.

21:13.272 --> 21:15.857
Well, it turns out
it did have a price, Dad,

21:15.941 --> 21:20.821
and that price was $35 for meth,
thank you very much.

21:20.904 --> 21:22.447
Laundry duty doesn't seem that bad.

21:22.531 --> 21:25.784
Well, it is when you know
what your brothers do into their socks.

21:28.370 --> 21:30.080
Did you get in a lot of trouble at my age?

21:30.163 --> 21:31.581
Oh, tons.

21:31.665 --> 21:35.210
Truancy, larceny, arsony.

21:35.294 --> 21:38.630
You know, a lot of the stuff I was doing
wasn't even illegal at the time.

21:38.714 --> 21:40.590
Have you heard of Klaus's Law?

21:40.674 --> 21:41.591
[Stan] Nope.

21:41.675 --> 21:43.760
[Klaus] Oh, whatever. It doesn't matter.

21:43.844 --> 21:46.972
Half the time,
I was just trying to piss off my dad,

21:47.639 --> 21:51.101
Luther, Diego, or Ben.

21:51.184 --> 21:53.770
-Yeah, oppositional defiant disorder.
-Huh?

21:53.854 --> 21:55.772
-At least that's what my shrink calls it.
-Go on.

21:55.856 --> 21:58.984
It's typically associated
with an argumentative, aggressive…

21:59.067 --> 22:00.235
[in unison] …irritable mood.

22:00.319 --> 22:01.320
-Exactly.
-Yeah.

22:01.403 --> 22:02.487
-Antisocial…
-Yeah.

22:02.571 --> 22:04.948
…risk-seeking behavior, and impulsivity.

22:05.032 --> 22:07.284
Ding-dong, who's at the door? Me.

22:07.909 --> 22:09.244
[Klaus] I have the-- Wow!

22:09.953 --> 22:12.664
You know, and it feels so good
to put a name to it,

22:12.748 --> 22:16.335
so all the drugs
and the manipulation and my cult and--

22:16.418 --> 22:17.294
You had a cult?

22:17.377 --> 22:19.546
Well, it was the '60s, babe.
Everybody had one.

22:19.629 --> 22:24.468
But the point is that all of that
was a reaction to my father

22:25.135 --> 22:28.638
and his obscenely high expectations of me.

22:28.722 --> 22:32.809
And then, after Dad,
I had Ben haunting my every move.

22:33.393 --> 22:34.311
Who's Ben?

22:35.020 --> 22:36.396
Ben is your dead uncle.

22:36.480 --> 22:38.357
Who's alive in this timeline.

22:38.440 --> 22:40.233
But he's dead to me. It doesn't matter.

22:40.317 --> 22:44.613
But, I mean, if I set this room on fire…

22:45.155 --> 22:45.989
Yeah?

22:46.490 --> 22:47.991
…would it be fulfilling?

22:49.785 --> 22:51.036
I don't know.

22:51.119 --> 22:53.121
If I was to act out now,

22:53.205 --> 22:55.707
I mean, who would it even be
in opposition to?

22:55.791 --> 22:57.918
-[laughs]
-[lighter clicks]

22:58.001 --> 23:01.963
Maybe this whole new timeline thingy
is a blessing in disguise,

23:02.047 --> 23:03.507
except for you, obviously.

23:03.590 --> 23:08.053
But maybe now I can have,
like, a normal-ish relationship

23:08.136 --> 23:10.389
with my cold and emotionless father.

23:11.807 --> 23:12.641
[Klaus] Huh?

23:16.353 --> 23:17.312
Stanley.

23:19.356 --> 23:22.067
Hey! Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay!

23:22.150 --> 23:23.527
Ch-pfff! Ch-pfff!

23:23.610 --> 23:25.445
-[Stan] Come on!
-No, put it back.

23:25.529 --> 23:26.530
[Klaus tsks]

23:26.613 --> 23:27.906
Okay, you caught me.

23:29.825 --> 23:31.868
All of it, please. Yes, yes.

23:31.952 --> 23:34.329
I thought you were supposed to be
the fun uncle.

23:34.871 --> 23:36.581
I know, me too.

23:36.665 --> 23:37.707
[chuckles]

23:38.917 --> 23:40.335
Can I just keep one thing?

23:41.378 --> 23:43.004
All right, you can keep the panties.

23:44.631 --> 23:46.216
I really should get home.

23:47.801 --> 23:49.094
I can't let you go.

23:50.011 --> 23:51.596
I don't wanna let you go either,

23:51.680 --> 23:55.308
but Jayme and Alphonso,
they deserve a proper burial.

23:55.392 --> 23:56.476
No, I mean,

23:57.519 --> 23:58.812
I can't let you leave.

23:59.646 --> 24:00.564
You're a hostage.

24:01.940 --> 24:04.443
Oh, right. That.

24:04.526 --> 24:06.778
My family already thinks I'm a traitor.
So, I can't--

24:06.862 --> 24:08.864
-No, I totally get it.
-Good.

24:08.947 --> 24:11.366
My family probably is plotting vengeance.

24:13.243 --> 24:15.495
So, I guess we just

24:16.371 --> 24:18.832
go back to fighting
until everybody's dead.

24:27.382 --> 24:30.302
We can put an end to this
and still be together.

24:31.261 --> 24:32.220
How?

24:45.233 --> 24:47.861
I need you to stay in here
until I figure some things out.

24:54.034 --> 24:57.496
Your sister called you Viktor.
Is that what I should call you?

24:58.622 --> 24:59.748
I'd like that.

25:04.586 --> 25:06.421
You know, your mom's a…

25:08.715 --> 25:10.133
a big part of who I am.

25:12.469 --> 25:14.930
She was the first person to truly see me.

25:16.890 --> 25:19.100
It's okay if you wanna ask about her.

25:20.894 --> 25:23.271
Did Sissy hate me for what I did to you?

25:27.692 --> 25:29.486
She said you saved her life.

25:32.614 --> 25:34.157
Did she have a good life?

25:40.872 --> 25:41.873
Hmm.

25:41.957 --> 25:44.042
Wasn't easy.

25:44.125 --> 25:46.753
Not with… me there.

25:48.171 --> 25:51.341
But she was free
in a way she never was on the farm.

25:52.217 --> 25:53.969
She never stopped thinking about you,

25:54.052 --> 25:57.681
and she never gave up hope
that you'd come back to us one day.

25:59.432 --> 26:00.684
Why did you leave us?

26:05.730 --> 26:06.773
I needed you.

26:08.316 --> 26:11.528
We thought you'd be safer away from me.

26:15.240 --> 26:16.658
But I wish I had stayed.

26:18.493 --> 26:19.828
I should have stayed.

26:32.549 --> 26:33.675
[door opens]

26:34.718 --> 26:36.261
Meeting in the poolroom.

26:36.886 --> 26:37.846
Family only.

26:40.974 --> 26:43.226
[Viktor] Stay here. I'll be right back.

26:51.067 --> 26:52.944
[Klaus and Stan yelling] Yeah!

26:53.028 --> 26:55.739
Go faster! Faster!

26:55.822 --> 26:59.284
-[Klaus] Coming through!
-[Stan] Yeah! Ooh.

26:59.367 --> 27:01.286
Squirt, make with the key on this one.

27:01.369 --> 27:02.537
-Chop-chop.
-Let me check.

27:04.414 --> 27:05.915
[keys jingling]

27:07.542 --> 27:09.461
[Stan] Nope, this room isn't on the list,

27:09.544 --> 27:12.005
and I'm not gonna clean a room
that's not even on the list.

27:12.088 --> 27:13.465
White Buffalo.

27:13.548 --> 27:16.009
I could pick the lock,
but Diego took my switchblade.

27:16.092 --> 27:17.218
Yeah, stand down.

27:17.302 --> 27:19.638
You know, I once had to pick a lock
with my teeth

27:19.721 --> 27:22.349
while partially paralyzed on Quaaludes.

27:22.432 --> 27:24.893
Oh man, that was an evening.

27:24.976 --> 27:26.811
All right, keep a watch out
for me, grasshopper.

27:26.895 --> 27:27.854
All right.

27:30.857 --> 27:32.192
You're serious?

27:32.275 --> 27:34.944
We use Sloane as an olive branch.

27:35.028 --> 27:36.905
We let her go as a gesture of peace,

27:36.988 --> 27:39.199
along with the bodies
of Jayme and Alphonso.

27:39.282 --> 27:41.576
Once I'm back with my family,
I can convince them

27:41.660 --> 27:44.162
the old guy had nothing to do with you
and get them to stand down.

27:44.245 --> 27:46.790
You wanna let her go
after attacking us? Uh-uh.

27:46.873 --> 27:49.876
Me? I lost two of my siblings
to you and your murder troll.

27:49.959 --> 27:52.295
Again, Harlan not with us.

27:52.379 --> 27:54.172
Well, he's not not with us.

27:54.255 --> 27:55.674
He was just trying to protect me.

27:55.757 --> 27:57.926
This only works
if I can convince my family

27:58.009 --> 28:00.595
he isn't a part of your team,
so is he with you or not?

28:00.679 --> 28:03.932
[Diego] Harlan saved our asses.
He can stay here as long as he wants.

28:04.015 --> 28:05.016
You know what, Luther?

28:05.100 --> 28:07.560
He can take your bed.
Since you're sleeping with the enemy.

28:07.644 --> 28:08.853
Watch it.

28:08.937 --> 28:09.854
Guys, come on.

28:13.858 --> 28:17.028
Having an ally on the inside
could help us right now.

28:17.112 --> 28:18.113
Right?

28:18.196 --> 28:20.824
Yeah, but how do we know
we can trust Gravity Barbie?

28:20.907 --> 28:22.742
[sighs] I trust her.

28:22.826 --> 28:25.245
Yeah, you trusted emails
from a Nigerian prince.

28:25.328 --> 28:27.956
Tunde was not a prince, he was a king,

28:28.039 --> 28:29.249
and he was unjustly deposed.

28:29.332 --> 28:30.333
Okay.

28:33.002 --> 28:34.546
So rumor me again.

28:34.629 --> 28:36.715
Go on, not hiding anything.

28:36.798 --> 28:37.966
Whatever it takes.

28:39.676 --> 28:42.053
Do whatever you wanna do, Luther.
That's on you.

28:42.137 --> 28:44.180
I've got bigger shit to deal with.

28:46.182 --> 28:47.392
[Diego] Allison. Wait up.

28:50.729 --> 28:53.064
This is just like
a bunch of bureaucratic bullshit.

28:53.148 --> 28:56.234
There's no clear directives in here
about crisis management.

28:56.860 --> 28:59.529
You know, Lila, I shouldn't even be here.
I was… I was out.

28:59.612 --> 29:03.825
I was done, and yet here I am,
swept back into the chaos.

29:04.367 --> 29:06.995
Why can't I just escape this hellhole?

29:07.078 --> 29:08.121
Because you love it.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.081
[flatulence]

29:11.374 --> 29:12.375
My bad.

29:13.960 --> 29:14.794
[Lila] Face it, Five,

29:14.878 --> 29:17.922
apocalypse problems are the only things
that get your heart pumping.

29:18.006 --> 29:21.676
I don't know why people keep saying that.
I don't actually like chaos.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.386
I don't want disorder. I…

29:24.095 --> 29:25.221
I want retirement.

29:25.305 --> 29:26.723
[laughs] Yeah, right. What?

29:26.806 --> 29:29.934
A normal life of groceries and taxes?
You would die of boredom.

29:30.018 --> 29:33.813
Yeah, well, you're not exactly cut out
for domestic bliss either.

29:37.150 --> 29:38.735
'Course I'm bloody not.

29:38.818 --> 29:39.861
Thank God!

29:40.487 --> 29:43.573
I mean, maybe it's a tone thing?

29:43.656 --> 29:48.077
I don't know, but you could really work
on, like, the way you speak.

29:48.161 --> 29:50.538
It's very… It's irritating.

29:51.581 --> 29:53.750
I'm just saying it's something
you can work on, you know?

29:53.833 --> 29:55.293
For the future.

29:55.376 --> 29:56.669
[Five sighs]

29:56.753 --> 29:58.713
Why you smiling, you little pisspot?

29:58.797 --> 29:59.964
'Cause of that.

30:01.841 --> 30:03.927
Well, you could have led with that.

30:08.306 --> 30:09.891
[slurping loudly]

30:12.727 --> 30:16.314
When you said you'd take me for a drink,
I had something a little stronger in mind.

30:16.397 --> 30:18.233
-Do not disrespect the Slushee.
-[scoffs]

30:19.526 --> 30:20.485
Check the glove box.

30:23.988 --> 30:25.865
Oh, thank God.

30:34.207 --> 30:36.334
You know, you're way more fun these days.

30:37.752 --> 30:38.586
Excuse me?

30:39.504 --> 30:42.298
Telling off Luther
and melting Sloane's brain.

30:42.382 --> 30:44.342
You were always the nice one of us.

30:45.051 --> 30:48.805
Okay, okay. You know,
grading on an umbrella curve.

30:48.888 --> 30:52.100
Yeah, well,
getting stuck in the past without Claire,

30:52.183 --> 30:56.187
then leaving Ray, thinking she'd be
waiting for me in the future

30:56.271 --> 30:59.566
only to discover
that she doesn't exist in the present

30:59.649 --> 31:01.818
could do that to a person.

31:02.318 --> 31:03.194
Jesus.

31:03.820 --> 31:05.405
-Do you wanna talk about it?
-No.

31:05.989 --> 31:07.073
Oh, come on.

31:08.449 --> 31:10.285
You know I'm a great therapist.

31:11.828 --> 31:13.246
They call me Dr. Fuego.

31:13.329 --> 31:14.539
No one calls you that.

31:14.622 --> 31:16.249
-They should though.
-Mm-mm.

31:16.332 --> 31:18.251
-That shit sounds badass.
-[laughs]

31:23.131 --> 31:25.341
I've never felt so hopeless in my life.

31:25.425 --> 31:26.801
[man] You're a pretty thing.

31:26.885 --> 31:29.262
[Allison] Even after my voice came back,

31:30.013 --> 31:33.600
I knew the cost
of standing up and speaking out.

31:33.683 --> 31:35.184
[protestors] No more back door!

31:35.268 --> 31:38.354
[chanting] Get out! Get out!
Get out! Get out!

31:38.438 --> 31:40.231
[Allison] Living every day under threat

31:40.315 --> 31:44.110
that you or someone you loved
would disappear or…

31:44.193 --> 31:45.653
[Ray wails in pain]

31:45.737 --> 31:48.197
…fall victim to some heinous crime.

31:49.657 --> 31:51.451
And there's nothing you can do about it.

31:51.534 --> 31:53.119
That shit lingers, huh?

31:53.703 --> 31:54.704
Yeah.

31:58.166 --> 32:00.668
I know we all got stuck in Dallas.
I just…

32:02.462 --> 32:04.380
I don't think some of the others

32:04.464 --> 32:06.758
really understand
what it was like for me, you know?

32:07.800 --> 32:08.635
Yeah.

32:10.345 --> 32:11.346
I know.

32:12.180 --> 32:13.806
[Diego] But hey, we're here now.

32:14.891 --> 32:17.644
-We made it back, right?
-[Allison] Yeah, and for what?

32:17.727 --> 32:20.021
Ray and Claire were the two things
keeping me together,

32:20.104 --> 32:22.190
and just like that,
they're gone, and I am…

32:22.273 --> 32:23.441
[sighs]

32:23.524 --> 32:26.527
I am so angry.
I don't know where to put any of it.

32:27.362 --> 32:29.405
You remember that vigilante shit
I used to do?

32:29.489 --> 32:31.115
Yeah. Bargain Batman.

32:31.199 --> 32:33.618
[both laughing]

32:33.701 --> 32:34.786
Smartass.

32:35.745 --> 32:38.706
You know, you guys all laugh,
but that shit helped me, man.

32:39.457 --> 32:42.293
Kicking assholes in their assholes
is like therapy,

32:42.377 --> 32:43.711
but for cool people.

32:45.964 --> 32:48.341
Yeah, trust me.
I wish I had somebody I could hit.

32:50.510 --> 32:54.722
Well, you spend enough time in the city,
you get to know a few things.

32:58.309 --> 32:59.352
People in there

33:01.020 --> 33:02.397
hate people like us.

33:06.859 --> 33:08.277
We can go in there.

33:10.279 --> 33:13.199
Get a drink, see if they start something.

33:14.701 --> 33:17.036
[Diego] And we make damn sure
we finish it.

33:19.455 --> 33:21.165
Or, we could just drive home.

33:22.792 --> 33:23.793
You know.

33:26.212 --> 33:29.799
[ominous music swelling]

33:31.050 --> 33:33.011
I could really use another drink.

33:36.639 --> 33:42.103
[dissonant rock music playing]

33:47.734 --> 33:50.611
[ship's horn sounding]

33:54.115 --> 33:56.284
[ominous instrumental music playing]

34:17.305 --> 34:19.307
[Christopher speaks]

34:34.197 --> 34:36.199
[Christopher speaks]

34:36.699 --> 34:39.285
Well, this is it. This puts an end to it.

34:39.368 --> 34:40.453
[Ben] No.

34:40.536 --> 34:42.080
We want the old man too.

34:42.163 --> 34:44.582
-What are you doing?
-You wanted a plan. Here it is.

34:44.665 --> 34:45.666
It's a stupid plan.

34:45.750 --> 34:47.585
-He isn't a part of the deal.
-[Ben] He is now.

34:47.668 --> 34:50.630
Ben, they aren't working with him.
They had nothing to do with the attacks--

34:50.713 --> 34:53.508
Then they won't mind finding him
and handing him over.

34:53.591 --> 34:54.759
[Ben] It's simple.

34:54.842 --> 34:58.679
Bring us the man who killed our siblings,
and this will all be over.

34:59.514 --> 35:00.515
If not…

35:03.059 --> 35:05.228
[Christopher speaks]

35:05.311 --> 35:07.438
[Christopher speaks]

35:10.733 --> 35:11.901
[car doors shutting]

35:11.984 --> 35:13.694
[car engine starts]

35:18.783 --> 35:19.992
Exsqueeze me.

35:21.202 --> 35:22.120
You're excused.

35:22.203 --> 35:23.538
Operations bunker.

35:27.166 --> 35:29.001
[device beeping]

35:30.753 --> 35:32.964
-[alarm buzzes]
-[Lila] We're screwed.

35:33.047 --> 35:35.174
-[female voice] Unauthorized access.
-Oh shit.

35:35.258 --> 35:39.011
Jesus. You're sweating like
a dodgy shrimp on ice. What's wrong?

35:39.595 --> 35:41.139
[flatulence]

35:49.939 --> 35:51.566
[device whirs]

35:56.362 --> 35:57.822
[device chimes]

35:57.905 --> 36:00.032
-[female voice] Access granted.
-[door unlocks]

36:00.116 --> 36:01.909
I guess you're essential personnel.

36:08.958 --> 36:09.959
Wow.

36:20.219 --> 36:21.470
[Lila chuckles]

36:24.348 --> 36:28.853
[ventilator hissing]

36:36.527 --> 36:38.070
[faint raspy breathing]

36:40.281 --> 36:41.908
[air hissing]

36:41.991 --> 36:43.284
[Five] That's him, huh?

36:45.077 --> 36:46.162
The founder.

36:47.205 --> 36:48.497
Looks like tinned beef.

36:49.165 --> 36:51.417
I was expecting more man and less…

36:52.210 --> 36:53.294
[metal clangs]

36:53.377 --> 36:54.253
…can.

37:02.470 --> 37:03.512
It can't be.

37:04.847 --> 37:05.723
What's wrong?

37:08.392 --> 37:09.560
It's me.

37:13.648 --> 37:16.859
[laughing]

37:19.654 --> 37:20.863
No way.

37:20.947 --> 37:24.075
This whole time you've been complaining
about the Commission,

37:24.158 --> 37:26.202
and you're the one who founded it.

37:26.827 --> 37:27.662
Classic.

37:27.745 --> 37:31.040
-If I did, I have no memory of it.
-[Lila laughs]

37:31.123 --> 37:33.167
So here I was thinking
you were a maverick,

37:33.251 --> 37:36.087
but you're a company man,
down to the bone.

37:36.170 --> 37:38.506
I mean, you… [laughs]

37:38.589 --> 37:41.884
You literally cannot breathe
without this place. [laughs]

37:41.968 --> 37:43.302
Something's not right.

37:44.011 --> 37:46.347
I don't have paradox psychosis.

37:46.889 --> 37:49.433
I could feel it outside,
but in here, it's…

37:51.519 --> 37:52.478
nothing.

37:52.561 --> 37:56.107
[raspy voice]
Never were too bright, were we?

37:59.235 --> 38:01.737
The operations bunker is

38:03.239 --> 38:05.241
paradox-proof.

38:05.324 --> 38:06.701
[old Five strains to inhale]

38:06.784 --> 38:10.413
I constructed it as a panic room

38:11.080 --> 38:15.710
in case of a collapse
in the time continuum.

38:16.419 --> 38:17.545
In this room,

38:19.046 --> 38:23.426
all permutations of yourself can exist.

38:25.636 --> 38:28.347
You must be here because of a…

38:29.890 --> 38:31.225
Kugelblitz.

38:35.146 --> 38:36.689
Is that like a cheese blintz?

38:37.440 --> 38:39.525
It's German for "ball of lightning."

38:40.234 --> 38:42.570
[Five] It's an extra kinky
kind of black hole.

38:43.362 --> 38:45.823
The kind that can
suck up entire timelines.

38:45.906 --> 38:46.949
Bingo.

38:47.033 --> 38:50.161
So, how do we fix it?

38:51.454 --> 38:53.414
[raspy chuckle]

38:53.497 --> 38:56.167
[coughing]

38:57.543 --> 38:58.836
You don't.

38:58.919 --> 39:01.464
If you created all of this,

39:01.547 --> 39:04.133
then you must have created a solution.

39:04.216 --> 39:06.594
[wheezing]

39:06.677 --> 39:09.013
[coughs, whimpers]

39:09.096 --> 39:11.557
All that will be left is…

39:14.518 --> 39:15.936
oblivion.

39:17.480 --> 39:20.441
[coughs, inhales]

39:20.524 --> 39:21.525
[Lila] Oblivion?

39:22.777 --> 39:23.694
What do you mean?

39:29.283 --> 39:32.078
This is what you have coming.

39:33.204 --> 39:34.914
Listen to me, you ass.

39:34.997 --> 39:38.376
I just spent the last 20 days
running around

39:38.459 --> 39:41.045
saving the world from apocalypses,

39:41.128 --> 39:44.507
only to keep trying to save the world.

39:45.007 --> 39:49.303
Now I am stuck in this pubescent body,
my hormones are raging,

39:49.387 --> 39:54.183
and all I wanna do is go out
and buy a 1970s Corvette Stingray.

39:54.266 --> 39:55.601
Take it easy on him, Five.

39:55.684 --> 39:58.104
Lila, this is between me and myself,

39:58.187 --> 39:59.563
so stay out of it.

40:00.106 --> 40:01.065
Thank you.

40:01.148 --> 40:04.652
Now, this Kugelblitz,
it is not some tiny leak

40:04.735 --> 40:08.364
that we can simply fix
by patching a couple of pinholes.

40:08.447 --> 40:13.744
It is a giant trash compactor
which is grinding up the universe

40:13.828 --> 40:15.871
and consuming it whole.

40:15.955 --> 40:17.581
So tell me

40:17.665 --> 40:20.042
how you stop it!

40:20.543 --> 40:22.002
Whatever you do…

[heart monitor beeping]

40:23.963 --> 40:25.423
[choking]

40:25.506 --> 40:27.591
…don't save the world.

[heart monitor beeps rapidly]

40:32.263 --> 40:34.807
[device powering down]

40:34.890 --> 40:36.892
What do you mean, don't save-- Five!

40:38.144 --> 40:39.395
[electricity powers down]

40:39.478 --> 40:40.771
[Five] How do I fix this?

40:44.859 --> 40:45.860
He's dead, Five.

40:52.491 --> 40:53.534
[sharp inhale]

40:56.328 --> 40:57.455
Can I have the room?

40:58.038 --> 40:59.957
Er… I don't think I should
leave you two alone.

41:00.040 --> 41:01.834
Lila, I need the room.
