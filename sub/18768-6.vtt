he smuggled tobacco, alcohol?

went back to the boat

Mike Wilson and
Frank Henderson
were friends.

he'd only deal
with him, nobody else.

11:38.200 --> 11:40.640

the deal's off?

the bank a fortune.

kill him before it was signed?

That's very deceitful.

12:24.640 --> 12:27.640
Frank was a family friend,
when I was a teenager.

12:27.720 --> 12:29.080
HUMPHREY:
How did your family know him?

12:29.160 --> 12:31.360
Well, it was my mum, really.

12:31.440 --> 12:35.360
Er, Frank was our neighbour.
It was years ago now.

12:35.440 --> 12:38.400
Frank lost his licence
for drink driving.

12:38.480 --> 12:40.480
Anyway,
my mum was out of work,

12:40.560 --> 12:44.000
so Frank employed
her to be his driver
until he got his licence back.

12:44.080 --> 12:45.240
Do you mind me asking, Steve,

12:45.320 --> 12:46.960
how old were you at the time?

12:47.720 --> 12:48.680
Fourteen.

12:49.920 --> 12:51.800
And I liked him.

12:51.880 --> 12:54.360
When I didn't do
that great at school,
he offered me a job here

12:54.440 --> 12:56.040
and I've been
working here ever since.

13:00.760 --> 13:03.320
I should have
told you this sooner,
shouldn't I?

13:03.400 --> 13:05.560
It's just I didn't think
it was relevant.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.000
You have to believe me,

13:09.080 --> 13:11.560
pretty much everything
that is good in my life now,

13:11.640 --> 13:13.600
I owe to Frank Henderson.

13:14.960 --> 13:17.240
Are you sure it was murder?

13:17.320 --> 13:19.440
Well, how do you mean?

13:19.520 --> 13:22.480
Only we had to
break Frank's door down
to get into his office.

13:22.560 --> 13:25.000
There was no one else in there
when we got inside.

13:25.080 --> 13:27.440
So if it was murder
rather than suicide,

13:27.520 --> 13:29.720
how did the killer
get out of a locked room

13:29.800 --> 13:31.200
before we'd even arrived?

13:31.280 --> 13:33.040
Yes, that's
something of a puzzler.

13:33.120 --> 13:35.560
And it was Frank
who was missing his cufflink.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.120
The one you were looking for.

13:41.720 --> 13:42.800
How do you know that?

13:42.880 --> 13:44.040
How do I know what?

13:44.120 --> 13:45.360
That Frank only
had one cufflink.

13:47.400 --> 13:49.360
Well, it's obvious, isn't it?

13:49.440 --> 13:51.200
If Frank committed suicide,

13:51.280 --> 13:53.560
it would be because
he killed that guy
in the Caribbean.

13:53.640 --> 13:55.040
For whatever reason.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.880
In which case,

13:57.960 --> 13:59.520
it must have
been Frank who left

13:59.600 --> 14:01.040
one of his
cufflinks on the boat.

14:05.480 --> 14:07.880
OK.

14:07.960 --> 14:10.560
Thank you for your time.
We've got no more questions.

14:10.640 --> 14:12.480
I'm free to go?
Yeah.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.360
Unless there's anything else
you'd like to tell us?

14:14.440 --> 14:16.360
No, no, I've told
you everything I know.

14:16.440 --> 14:17.400
Thank you.

14:22.880 --> 14:24.440
Slip of the tongue?

14:24.520 --> 14:26.040
It was that all right.

14:27.160 --> 14:28.520
Question is,

14:28.600 --> 14:31.320
whether he thought it through,
like he said,

14:31.400 --> 14:33.360
or because he's our killer.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.760
I don't know why yet,
I'm not even sure how,

14:36.800 --> 14:38.240
but I think he's our man.

14:42.280 --> 14:46.200
OK, this is your bail document
relating to
the smuggling charge.

14:46.280 --> 14:48.000
We need to know
where you're staying

14:48.080 --> 14:49.760
each night until
the court hearing.

14:49.840 --> 14:51.480
I understand.

14:51.560 --> 14:53.640
Please, catch his killer.

14:53.720 --> 14:56.360
SELWYN: OK, will do.

14:56.440 --> 14:59.760
Well, that was the Inspector.

14:59.840 --> 15:02.160
He's pretty sure
we've found our killer.

15:02.240 --> 15:04.040
We have, sir? Great!

15:04.120 --> 15:06.200
He wants us to concentrate
on Steve Thomas,

15:06.280 --> 15:08.520
find anything that links him
to the victim.

15:08.600 --> 15:11.680
So I suggest we
start working through

15:11.760 --> 15:14.720
Mr Lewis' papers
and phone records.

15:15.840 --> 15:19.000
If the Inspector is right,

15:19.080 --> 15:22.800
we may find a reference to him
somewhere in here.

15:23.600 --> 15:24.560
Yes, sir.

15:26.640 --> 15:29.280
I'll start with this.
You do the rest.

There's nothing suspicious
in Steve Thomas'
bank statements.

16:37.600 --> 16:41.160
Has no major debt
as far as I can see.

16:41.240 --> 16:44.520
But there's
something interesting
on Frank's bank statements.

Dwayne.
Huh?

16:50.560 --> 16:51.520
Are you listening?

16:53.840 --> 16:58.200
Frank Henderson
has a standing order
every month of £280

16:58.280 --> 17:01.960
that goes to a company
called Beaumount
Street Heath Clinic.

17:02.040 --> 17:06.520
I just looked them up
and they offer
psychiatric counselling.

17:06.600 --> 17:08.520
He was in therapy?

17:08.600 --> 17:12.080
Maybe Frank wasn't as together
as everyone thought.

17:12.160 --> 17:15.040
You think maybe he
did kill Tom Lewis,
then shot himself?

17:16.400 --> 17:17.880
I better tell the Inspector.

17:17.960 --> 17:18.920
Good idea.

17:25.720 --> 17:27.440
OK, thanks, Florence.
Call the clinic,

17:27.520 --> 17:29.120

you can find out.

About these two wolves

one is love, truth,

which one of
the wolves would win.

from his flat.

27:09.800 --> 27:11.200
Any joy from the clinic?

27:11.280 --> 27:13.320
No. They won't release
their patient case files

27:13.400 --> 27:14.760
without a court order.

27:14.840 --> 27:16.200
I've applied for one.

27:16.280 --> 27:17.800
Oh, good. Anything else?

27:17.880 --> 27:19.920
Well, we went through
all the financials last night.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.920
Martin West and Dominic Green
each paid £100,000

27:23.000 --> 27:26.080
to a company called
London Equity
Trading five weeks ago.

27:26.160 --> 27:27.280
And?

27:27.360 --> 27:28.360
I called London
Equity Trading.

27:30.120 --> 27:32.400
Mr West and Mr Green
gave them the money

27:32.480 --> 27:34.640
to go short on
Mr Wilson's company.

27:34.720 --> 27:36.720
I'm sorry,
Dwayne, what does this mean?

27:36.800 --> 27:38.800
Turns out it means
they bet their money

27:38.880 --> 27:40.840
that the share price
of Mike Wilson's company

27:40.920 --> 27:42.560
was about to go down.

27:42.640 --> 27:44.200
They bet £200,000 on this?

27:44.280 --> 27:45.680
Yep.

27:45.760 --> 27:47.680
That doesn't make sense.

27:47.760 --> 27:50.200
Because it was going to go up
when they'd sign the deal,
surely.

27:50.280 --> 27:51.720
Exactly, sir.

27:51.800 --> 27:53.480
But since
the deal fell through,

27:53.560 --> 27:56.160
the share price of
Mr Wilson's company
has collapsed.

27:56.240 --> 27:58.720
Just like Martin and Dominic
bet it would.

27:58.800 --> 28:01.600
So maybe Steve Thomas
isn't our man, after all.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.160
FLORENCE: But there is more.

28:05.760 --> 28:07.440
Forensics.

28:07.520 --> 28:09.960
The gun used to
kill Frank Henderson
was wiped clean.

28:10.040 --> 28:13.480
Or whoever killed him
tried to wipe it clean.

28:13.560 --> 28:15.640
But it looks like
they only did the handle.

28:15.720 --> 28:18.360
There were three
clean fingerprints
on the barrel.

28:18.440 --> 28:20.120
Belonging to Martin West.

28:29.800 --> 28:31.680
We'll be in touch.
Thanks very much.

28:37.240 --> 28:38.600
Why don't you say
what you came here to say

28:38.680 --> 28:39.680
so we can get this over with?

28:39.760 --> 28:41.040
Very well.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.640
Martin, can you tell us
why we found your prints

28:42.720 --> 28:45.000
on the gun that was used
to kill Frank Henderson?

28:45.080 --> 28:46.160
I told you they'd find out.

28:46.240 --> 28:47.200
What is this?

28:48.240 --> 28:49.520
OK, I can explain.

28:50.640 --> 28:52.680
The gun belongs to me.

28:52.760 --> 28:55.720
Rather, it was my
father's originally,
from the Second World War.

28:55.800 --> 29:00.680
I took it into
the office years ago,
you know, to impress the lads.

29:00.760 --> 29:02.680
It's been in
the drawer of my desk
ever since.

29:02.760 --> 29:04.200
Was it kept
under lock and key?

29:06.440 --> 29:07.960
So anyone could have taken it?

29:08.040 --> 29:10.000
Anyone with a motive.

29:10.080 --> 29:11.920
HUMPHREY: It's interesting
you say that, Mr Green.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.960
Detective Sergeant.

29:14.040 --> 29:18.520
You each bet £100,000
that the share price

29:18.600 --> 29:21.680
of Mr Wilson's company
was going to go down.

29:21.760 --> 29:25.360
Even as you were
putting together a deal
to save his company.

29:25.440 --> 29:26.720
Can you explain that?

29:27.840 --> 29:29.240
OK.

29:29.320 --> 29:30.600
Wilson had always said

29:30.680 --> 29:33.080
that he'd never sell
any portion of the company.

29:33.160 --> 29:35.160
Not to anyone.

29:35.240 --> 29:36.920
Martin and I never thought
it would happen,

29:37.000 --> 29:39.720
so we decided
to place a little side bet.

29:39.800 --> 29:41.920
And the moment
the deal was signed

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
you'd both stand
to lose £100,000.

29:44.080 --> 29:45.360
DOMINIC: So?

29:45.440 --> 29:46.960
That's how it
goes in the city.

29:47.040 --> 29:48.840
Smart guys always
hedge their bets.

29:48.920 --> 29:53.200
That's all that we were doing.
It's standard practice.

29:53.280 --> 29:55.280
And you really
think that Martin
would be so stupid

29:55.360 --> 29:56.960
as to use his own
gun to commit murder

29:57.040 --> 29:58.440
and then fail
to wipe
the prints off afterwards?

29:58.520 --> 30:00.840
Good point.

30:00.920 --> 30:03.920
So maybe the real killer
used Mr West's
gun to frame him.

30:05.240 --> 30:07.320
Look,
I know that I'm innocent,

30:07.400 --> 30:08.840
so maybe you should be
looking elsewhere.

30:08.920 --> 30:09.880
Where?

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
Steve Thomas.

30:17.080 --> 30:19.760
You know he's been seeing
a psychiatrist for years?

30:19.840 --> 30:23.880
Is this the psychiatrist
Frank Henderson
pays for each month?

30:23.960 --> 30:26.000
Steve said that
Frank paid for it.

30:26.080 --> 30:27.840
So why is Steve in therapy?

30:27.920 --> 30:30.200
Look, why don't you ask him?

30:30.280 --> 30:33.680
Now, if you'll excuse us,
we've got to get back to work.

30:48.440 --> 30:49.760
SELWYN: Officer Hooper?

30:52.880 --> 30:53.920
Officer Hooper?

30:54.000 --> 30:55.680
Commissioner!

30:55.760 --> 30:58.160
Commissioner!
I wasn't sleeping on the job.

30:58.240 --> 30:59.560
You weren't?
No, sir.

31:00.920 --> 31:02.360
Although maybe I was.

31:02.440 --> 31:04.400
But I came back to the office
yesterday evening,

31:04.480 --> 31:06.160
and I found
a memory card hidden

31:06.240 --> 31:07.960
in the bottom of
Mr Lewis' cash box.

31:08.040 --> 31:11.760
It turned out it was a copy
of his old hard
drive from the 1990s,

31:11.840 --> 31:13.280
before he fled the UK,

31:13.360 --> 31:15.560
when he was still working
in the city of London.

31:15.640 --> 31:18.440
So, I printed out
everything I could find on it.

31:18.520 --> 31:21.880
Yeah,
old emails, correspondence,

31:21.960 --> 31:25.240
photos,
there's even a contacts list.

31:25.320 --> 31:26.920
Any mention of Steve Thomas?

31:29.200 --> 31:31.760
Well,
I was going through it, sir,
when I...

31:32.760 --> 31:33.760
Fell asleep?

31:36.160 --> 31:39.440
But we don't
need to mention that
on my appraisal.

31:39.520 --> 31:40.840
Do we, sir?

31:44.160 --> 31:47.800
I suggest we
crack on, don't you?

31:51.560 --> 31:52.560
(SIGHS)

31:57.960 --> 32:00.600
(GRUNTS) There you go.

32:00.680 --> 32:02.760
I thought you might be in need
of a little sustenance.

32:02.840 --> 32:05.480
Oh, it's very good
of you, Humphrey,
thank you.

32:05.560 --> 32:07.000
So, anything?

32:07.080 --> 32:09.800
No, he's still in there.
I think.

32:09.880 --> 32:12.280
He hasn't moved all night.

32:12.360 --> 32:14.160
So how did it go?
Go?

32:16.080 --> 32:19.360
Oh right, um, good, good.

32:19.440 --> 32:21.880
We got some closure.
I think that was important.

32:22.840 --> 32:24.800
I'm glad I went. Thank you.

32:27.160 --> 32:28.320
There he is!
(JACK GROANS)

32:28.400 --> 32:29.440
Stop!

32:35.600 --> 32:36.720
(BOTH GRUNT)

32:37.640 --> 32:38.760
(GRUNTS)

32:40.560 --> 32:42.120
Right! You are under arrest!

32:44.880 --> 32:47.400
It looks like he was planning
to do a runner.

32:47.480 --> 32:49.360
I've also been
through his mobile phone.

32:49.440 --> 32:51.840
No calls of any significance
since yesterday.

32:51.920 --> 32:54.520
Just a few to his mum.
That's it.

33:03.280 --> 33:04.280
(SIGHS)

33:05.600 --> 33:07.240
So, Mr Thomas.

33:09.320 --> 33:10.840
Where were we off
to this morning?

33:10.920 --> 33:12.320
I was just going to get
a train somewhere. Anywhere.

33:12.400 --> 33:13.800
Get away for the weekend.

33:13.880 --> 33:16.000
Well, if it was that innocent,
why did you run?

33:16.080 --> 33:18.240
I don't know, I just panicked.

33:18.320 --> 33:20.560
I've done nothing wrong.

33:20.640 --> 33:23.680
Even though you hid the truth
of your relationship
with Mr Henderson?

33:23.760 --> 33:26.560
Just like you hid
your weekly
therapy sessions from us?

33:26.640 --> 33:29.160
And the fact that
Mr Henderson pays for them.

33:29.240 --> 33:30.880
Does he?
Mmm-hmm.

33:30.960 --> 33:33.000
Well, that's going
to take some explaining.

33:34.480 --> 33:37.320
Listen,
when I first met Frank,

33:37.400 --> 33:39.600
I wasn't just
doing badly at school
like I told you,

33:39.680 --> 33:42.200
I was seriously messed up.

33:42.280 --> 33:44.400
And I just lost it one day.

33:44.480 --> 33:46.160
Couldn't cope.

33:46.240 --> 33:49.200
Took an overdose
of pills and vodka.

33:51.160 --> 33:53.760
But it was Frank who found me
and took me to hospital.

33:54.880 --> 33:56.200
He saved my life.

33:57.720 --> 34:00.440
And he's been helping me
with therapy, as well.

34:00.520 --> 34:03.040
That's why I'd never harm him.

34:03.120 --> 34:06.080
If it wasn't for him,
I wouldn't even
be alive today.

34:08.480 --> 34:09.480
FLORENCE: Sir.

34:11.880 --> 34:12.880
Inspector.

34:20.800 --> 34:22.800
Gunshot residue
results are in.

34:22.880 --> 34:24.800
There was no
gunshot residue found

34:24.880 --> 34:26.720
anywhere on Frank
Henderson's hand.

34:26.800 --> 34:28.960
That's not surprising
as we don't believe
he killed himself.

34:29.040 --> 34:32.600
There was no gunshot residue
on Steve Thomas' hands either.

34:32.680 --> 34:37.360
Or on his shirt or his jacket
or anywhere on his clothes,
in fact.

34:37.440 --> 34:38.640
He didn't fire the gun?

34:38.720 --> 34:40.760
It gets worse.

34:40.840 --> 34:45.040
There was no gunshot
residue on Mr Green
or Mr West's clothes or hands.

34:45.120 --> 34:47.040
None of them fired that gun.

34:52.920 --> 34:53.960
Can I go now?

34:57.240 --> 34:58.680
You are not going anywhere
except to our cells.

34:58.760 --> 35:00.320
But I didn't do it!

35:00.400 --> 35:01.720
Dwayne, to the cells.
Thank you.

35:01.800 --> 35:02.800
Come on.

35:07.880 --> 35:10.120
(SIGHS) How did
Steve pull the trigger
without touching the gun?

35:10.200 --> 35:12.400
How did he get out
of a locked room afterwards?

35:13.480 --> 35:15.680
(SIGHS) Uh, Florence,

35:15.760 --> 35:18.120
get onto that cleaner who was
first on the scene,
what was her name?

35:18.200 --> 35:19.720
Katherine Baxter.

35:19.800 --> 35:21.480
Yes, let's speak to her again,
go over her statement,

35:21.560 --> 35:23.640
maybe she'll
remember something
about where Steve was

35:23.720 --> 35:25.240
or what he was doing
just before she arrived.

35:25.320 --> 35:26.720
Yes, sir.

35:26.800 --> 35:29.360
And we still need to work out
why Steve Thomas

35:29.440 --> 35:31.840
would want to kill the man
who once saved his life.

35:31.920 --> 35:34.120
And how on earth
that murder is linked

35:34.200 --> 35:36.480
to the murder of Tom Lewis
in the Caribbean.

35:41.760 --> 35:42.760
(SIGHS)

36:10.400 --> 36:11.400
Yes!

36:12.800 --> 36:13.920
This is it!

36:18.520 --> 36:20.200
Sir,
I just rang Katherine Baxter

36:20.280 --> 36:21.880
on the contact
number she gave us,

36:21.960 --> 36:23.720
and it doesn't exist.

36:23.800 --> 36:25.920
So I looked up the address
she gave in her statement,

36:26.000 --> 36:27.520
and that doesn't exist either.

36:27.600 --> 36:29.000
It doesn't?
No.

36:29.080 --> 36:30.960
So I called the HR department
of City Met Bank

36:31.040 --> 36:32.760
and they said
the strangest thing.

36:32.840 --> 36:34.760
Wait.

36:34.840 --> 36:37.120
There's no Kath Baxter working
as a cleaner on the payroll,
right?

36:37.200 --> 36:38.520
DWAYNE: Thank you, sir.

36:38.600 --> 36:40.440
Chief!
Yes?

36:40.520 --> 36:42.080
Commissioner on
conference calling,
says he's got something.

36:42.160 --> 36:44.000
OK, Commissioner. (SIGHS)

36:44.080 --> 36:45.800
Inspector?
Yes, sir.

36:45.880 --> 36:47.680
Are you there?
Yes. What have you got for us?

36:47.760 --> 36:50.760
It turns out we
found a memory card,

36:50.840 --> 36:53.360
hidden in a box
on Mr Lewis' boat.

36:53.440 --> 36:57.560
Officer Hooper has emailed
one particular
photo over to you.

36:57.640 --> 36:59.920
Hold on,
sir, let me get that up.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.040
Where are we? Where are we?

37:07.400 --> 37:08.880
Have you got it yet?

37:08.960 --> 37:11.600
Hang on, it's Tom Lewis
with his wife and his son.

37:11.680 --> 37:13.560
Not just his one son.

37:13.640 --> 37:15.920
According to his records,
he had two sons.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.960
And look who
the younger one is.

37:20.240 --> 37:21.640
That's Steve Thomas.

37:23.920 --> 37:25.680
He's Tom Lewis' son?

37:25.760 --> 37:27.680
Florence, can you get hold
of his birth certificate?

37:27.760 --> 37:28.800
FLORENCE: Yes, sir.

37:29.760 --> 37:31.920
This is it, isn't it?

37:32.000 --> 37:34.600
The link between Steve Thomas
and Tom Lewis

37:34.680 --> 37:36.560
that we've been looking for
all this time.

37:36.640 --> 37:39.440
And we know that
Frank Henderson
is a friend of the family.

37:39.520 --> 37:42.800
So Steve Thomas
is the only link
between these two men. But...

37:42.880 --> 37:46.200
There was no gunshot residue
on Steve Thomas' hands.

37:46.280 --> 37:49.560
He didn't fire the gun
that killed Frank Henderson.

37:49.640 --> 37:52.160
And even if he did,
we still don't know

37:52.240 --> 37:54.720
how he got
outside the locked room.

37:54.800 --> 37:56.080
Yeah.

37:56.160 --> 37:58.560
Assuming, of course,
it was, actually...

37:58.640 --> 38:00.040
Oh, my word!

38:00.120 --> 38:01.120
Get away from the door.

38:01.800 --> 38:03.240
Ah!

38:03.320 --> 38:04.240
HUMPHREY: You're certain
there was no one inside

38:04.320 --> 38:06.080
when the door was broken into?

38:06.160 --> 38:07.600
KATH: I couldn't see
anyone else, no.

38:07.680 --> 38:10.320
FLORENCE: "Frank has known
Mr Thomas for years."

38:10.400 --> 38:11.480
How did your family know him?

38:11.560 --> 38:12.720
It was my mum, really.

38:12.800 --> 38:14.600
Tom was a brilliant sailor.

38:14.680 --> 38:17.840
But one day, he went out
when a storm was forecast.

38:17.920 --> 38:19.160
He took his son.

38:19.240 --> 38:21.520
I was seriously messed up.

38:21.600 --> 38:23.480
Took an overdose.

38:23.560 --> 38:25.400
When there is no possible way
for something
to have happened,

38:25.480 --> 38:27.080
it probably didn't.

38:27.160 --> 38:28.520
But that's not possible,
is it?

38:28.600 --> 38:29.600
What?

38:29.680 --> 38:30.680
Er... Hang on.

38:34.680 --> 38:36.560
I'm not sure I'm following.

38:36.640 --> 38:38.080
That's it.

38:38.160 --> 38:39.480
What is?

38:39.560 --> 38:40.600
Do you get it?

38:44.880 --> 38:46.800
Of course. That's very clever.

38:46.880 --> 38:49.680
It's very devious.

38:49.760 --> 38:52.280
But if Steve Thomas
isn't our man,

38:52.360 --> 38:54.920
then what's the best way
of using that information...

38:55.000 --> 38:57.360
To bring Frank
Henderson's killer
out of the shadows?

38:57.440 --> 38:58.720
Exactly.

38:58.800 --> 39:02.120
Er... Steve's phone.
Steve's phone. Where is it?

39:05.160 --> 39:07.360
Shall I?
Be my guest.

39:07.440 --> 39:09.040
I have no idea
what's going on. You?

39:10.120 --> 39:13.000
Police know everything.

39:13.080 --> 39:16.920
Meet me at the office
in half an hour.

39:17.000 --> 39:18.520
I like it.
Yeah.

39:18.600 --> 39:19.640
And send.

39:28.040 --> 39:29.720
Have you got an eyeball
on our suspect yet?

39:30.800 --> 39:32.520
Yes, Chief.

39:32.600 --> 39:34.400
The eagle has landed.

39:34.480 --> 39:35.840
The eagle has landed!

39:35.920 --> 39:36.920
(SIGHS)

39:39.440 --> 39:40.480
Ah, Florence.

39:40.560 --> 39:41.720
OK.

39:41.800 --> 39:43.320
So what is it
you want us to see?

39:43.400 --> 39:44.720
I thought you
might be interested

39:44.800 --> 39:46.560
to meet Frank Henderson's
killer,

39:46.640 --> 39:48.320
who is coming up in the lift,

39:48.400 --> 39:49.440
right now.

39:52.880 --> 39:55.920
DOMINIC: Er, sorry,
went to the little boys' room.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.960
What's going on?
I don't understand.

39:58.040 --> 39:59.600
If Frank's
killer is in the lift,

39:59.680 --> 40:01.120
and the three of us
are already here...

40:01.200 --> 40:02.720
(LIFT DINGS)

40:02.800 --> 40:04.720
HUMPHREY: Katherine Baxter,
our mysterious cleaner.

40:04.800 --> 40:06.280
Arrest her, Florence,

40:06.360 --> 40:07.360
for murder.

40:20.040 --> 40:21.600
So what's as big
as an elephant,

40:22.600 --> 40:24.120
looks like an elephant,

40:24.200 --> 40:25.440
and weighs nothing at all?

40:28.480 --> 40:30.760
Well, the answer is,
of course, a shadow.

40:30.840 --> 40:32.400
If it's
the shadow of an elephant.

40:32.480 --> 40:34.320
(CHUCKLES)

40:34.400 --> 40:37.640
Well,
because there's been a shadow
in this case all along.

40:41.120 --> 40:42.760
That was you,
Ms Baxter, wasn't it?

40:44.880 --> 40:47.040
Because it was you who killed
Frank Henderson.

40:50.720 --> 40:52.880
Why would an office cleaner
want to kill Frank?

40:54.080 --> 40:55.480
Well, because, Mr Green,

40:57.880 --> 40:59.680
she's not really
an office cleaner.

41:04.040 --> 41:05.040
She's Steve's mother.

41:07.120 --> 41:09.000
Here we have all
the evidence we need.

41:10.440 --> 41:13.200
Steve's mother is listed
as Katherine Thomas.

41:13.280 --> 41:15.960
And his father, Tom Lewis.

41:17.880 --> 41:19.280
I suppose you took
your mother's surname

41:19.360 --> 41:20.640
after your father
left the country?

41:21.160 --> 41:22.160
Yes.

41:24.360 --> 41:25.800
You might want to see this.

41:26.800 --> 41:27.880
Where did you get this?

41:27.960 --> 41:29.760
HUMPHREY: Because it turns out

41:29.840 --> 41:32.480
Mr Lewis
couldn't leave his past
entirely behind.

41:36.040 --> 41:39.160
But now we can
finally understand
why Tom Lewis had to die.

41:40.840 --> 41:43.880
Because back in the day,
he and his family

41:43.960 --> 41:47.400
were great friends
with a fellow broker,
Frank Henderson.

41:49.960 --> 41:52.080
That's when you
first got to know him,
wasn't it?

41:52.160 --> 41:54.240
You and your older brother.

41:54.320 --> 41:56.560
Then one day, tragedy struck.

41:56.640 --> 41:58.880
And I remember
Frank made
a slip of the tongue

41:58.960 --> 42:00.560
when he told us the story.

42:00.640 --> 42:03.200
And they were
both swept overboard.

42:03.280 --> 42:04.800
HUMPHREY:
It sounded like he meant

42:04.880 --> 42:07.600
that both Mr Lewis and his son
were swept overboard.

42:07.680 --> 42:09.360
But what he really meant

42:09.440 --> 42:11.000
was that both
Mr Lewis' children

42:11.080 --> 42:13.000
were on board
the boat that day.

42:13.080 --> 42:14.760
And both of them
were swept overboard.

42:16.320 --> 42:17.560
Isn't that right, Steve?

42:19.200 --> 42:21.320
You and your brother
were swept into the sea.

42:22.560 --> 42:24.320
Your father must
have been faced

42:24.400 --> 42:26.040
with every
parent's worst nightmare.

42:28.960 --> 42:31.200
He could only dive in
and save one of his children.

42:31.280 --> 42:33.680
So who did he choose?

42:36.880 --> 42:37.960
It wasn't you, was it?

42:41.080 --> 42:43.040
Tom should never
have gone out that day.

42:44.520 --> 42:47.000
He knew there was
a storm forecast.

42:47.080 --> 42:48.920
TOM: We're brilliant sailors.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.560
And we can go out
as far as we can go.

42:51.640 --> 42:54.960
When it all happened,
he tried to save John.

42:55.040 --> 42:57.840
Our eldest.
But it was no good.

42:58.880 --> 43:00.360
He drowned.

43:00.440 --> 43:01.920
Tom thought Steve
had drowned as well.

43:02.000 --> 43:03.440
Steve! Steve!

43:03.520 --> 43:05.360
KATH:
That he'd lost both of them.

43:05.440 --> 43:07.160
(SOBS)

43:07.240 --> 43:10.000
Steve was picked
up by a lifeboat
a little while after.

43:10.080 --> 43:14.440
So when he saw Steve,
and realised he was alive,

43:14.520 --> 43:16.560
he should have been happy.

43:16.640 --> 43:18.720
But he knew what
Steve was thinking.

43:21.000 --> 43:24.000
That his own father hadn't
tried to save him.

43:34.600 --> 43:36.240
I can't even begin
to think how you felt

43:36.320 --> 43:37.880
every time you
looked at your father.

43:39.840 --> 43:42.120
And knowing you were the one
he left to die.

43:42.200 --> 43:44.400
Leave him alone!

43:44.480 --> 43:46.280
I was the one
that killed Frank Henderson.

43:46.360 --> 43:47.680
You got that exactly right.

43:47.760 --> 43:49.760
I know.

43:49.840 --> 43:53.200
But you killed Frank
because he was
going to tell us

43:53.280 --> 43:55.160
who killed Mr Lewis
out in the Caribbean.

43:55.240 --> 43:56.240
Wasn't he?

43:58.040 --> 43:59.600
That person being
your son, Steve.

44:01.720 --> 44:03.680
And in the cruellest
coincidence of all,

44:03.760 --> 44:05.640
on an island in the Caribbean,

44:05.720 --> 44:08.680
you recognised the father
who left you to die.

44:08.760 --> 44:10.440
But he didn't recognise you.

44:10.520 --> 44:13.680
And once Steve realised
who the local
boat captain was,

44:13.760 --> 44:15.480
was the man who
left him with nothing.

44:15.560 --> 44:17.160
Who left him to drown.

44:20.120 --> 44:22.800
All those years
of hate boiled up,
didn't they?

44:23.760 --> 44:25.160
And later that night,

44:25.240 --> 44:27.000
you followed your father
back to his boat.

44:31.080 --> 44:33.000
Is that where you saw him

44:33.080 --> 44:35.840
open the secret compartment
to take delivery
of the smuggled rum?

44:38.280 --> 44:39.720
You confronted him.

44:39.800 --> 44:42.040
And things escalated,
didn't they?

44:42.120 --> 44:43.560
Remember me?

44:43.640 --> 44:44.880
HUMPHREY:
Because if your father
was prepared

44:44.960 --> 44:46.400
to leave you for dead
all those yours ago,

44:46.480 --> 44:49.320
well, then, you were prepared
to return the favour.

44:51.200 --> 44:52.240
(GROANS)

44:53.960 --> 44:56.640
HUMPHREY:
Once you'd
wreaked your revenge,

44:56.720 --> 44:59.080
you were stuck with
a bit of a problem.

44:59.160 --> 45:01.960
The dead body
of your long-estranged father.

45:02.040 --> 45:03.360
And the partner,
Sophie, who was coming

45:03.440 --> 45:05.360
back to
the boat at any moment.

45:05.440 --> 45:08.120
Which is when, I assume,
you remembered
a storm was coming in.

45:08.200 --> 45:10.200
I'll bet you
thought it was fate.

45:10.280 --> 45:13.840
Just as your
betrayal had happened
on a boat, in a storm,

45:13.920 --> 45:16.440
so your revenge
would be the same.

45:16.520 --> 45:17.920
You took the boat out to sea.

45:18.000 --> 45:19.720
And when the storm
had blown through,

45:19.800 --> 45:21.840
you set the scene.

45:21.920 --> 45:23.760
Pulling down the rigging,
dropping the boom.

45:23.840 --> 45:25.280
You dressed your
father to make it look

45:25.360 --> 45:26.680
like he'd wrestled
with the storm all night.

45:32.880 --> 45:34.960
Your master stroke,

45:35.040 --> 45:38.080
absolute master stroke,

45:38.160 --> 45:40.640
was to do the one thing
that no killer ever does.

45:42.360 --> 45:44.920
That was to stay
at the scene of the crime.

45:45.000 --> 45:46.160
That was brilliant.

45:54.720 --> 45:57.360
Knowing that if you could
hold your nerve,

45:57.440 --> 45:59.760
well, you could employ
some pretty novel accomplices

45:59.840 --> 46:02.120
to get you back to shore.

46:02.200 --> 46:04.000
Namely,
the Saint Marie police force.

46:09.600 --> 46:11.120
Then once the coast was clear,

46:13.560 --> 46:14.560
just leave at
your own convenience.

46:19.160 --> 46:21.360
FLORENCE:
But you made one mistake.

46:21.440 --> 46:25.640
When you were
fighting your dad,
your cufflink tore off.

46:25.720 --> 46:28.480
Which meant we came
looking for you in London.

46:28.560 --> 46:30.240
And the moment
Frank Henderson learned

46:30.320 --> 46:32.400
that Tom Lewis had been
the man who had
been killed that day,

46:34.120 --> 46:36.120
well, he knew.

46:36.200 --> 46:38.400
There was only one person
it could have been.

46:38.480 --> 46:40.320
I mean, this was a man
who made a living
out of making deals.

46:42.320 --> 46:45.280
I'll wager he
tried to convince you
to hand yourself in.

46:45.360 --> 46:47.280
To get a reduced
sentence for doing so.

46:47.360 --> 46:49.400
But that's not how you saw it.

46:49.480 --> 46:51.600
It's not how your
mother saw it, either.

46:55.800 --> 47:01.200
It's just, I think,
she then set in motion a plan

47:01.280 --> 47:04.240
only to be enacted
if Frank refused
to back down, mind.

47:04.320 --> 47:05.440
KATH: He's got to see reason!

47:05.520 --> 47:08.000
FRANK: Come in!

47:08.080 --> 47:10.440
Unfortunately,
Frank couldn't
do that, could he?

47:10.520 --> 47:13.200
You must confess.
If you don't confess...

47:13.280 --> 47:14.640
I can't confess!
I'm ringing them now, I...

47:14.720 --> 47:15.960
No, don't touch that phone!

47:16.040 --> 47:17.360
Come on,
you're not going to use that.

47:17.440 --> 47:19.280
KATH: I will.
You won't use it.

47:19.360 --> 47:21.000
Touch that phone...

47:21.760 --> 47:22.880
(GASPS)

47:30.040 --> 47:31.400
So you shot him dead.

47:32.880 --> 47:35.200
Yeah, in cold blood.

47:35.280 --> 47:36.880
Leaving your son
to set the scene

47:36.960 --> 47:38.400
to make it look
like a suicide.

47:40.840 --> 47:43.760
I imagine that's when
Steve took Frank's cufflink.

47:45.160 --> 47:48.280
But your plan required
one final flourish.

47:48.360 --> 47:51.640
After all,
why would a passing cleaner
say that a room was locked,

47:51.720 --> 47:53.360
when it wasn't?

47:53.440 --> 47:55.320
KATH: The door's locked!

47:55.400 --> 47:59.960
And who would be looking
if she only
engaged the lock after...

48:00.040 --> 48:02.160
After the door
had been bashed in.

48:02.680 --> 48:03.720
Oh, God!

48:05.160 --> 48:06.200
He shot himself!

48:11.440 --> 48:14.600
It was an apparently
impossible murder.

48:17.880 --> 48:20.880
Which only made
sense once you realised

48:20.960 --> 48:24.280
the real identities
of the two people involved.

48:24.360 --> 48:26.080
A son who killed his father,

48:27.640 --> 48:30.960
and a mother
who had already lost one son,

48:31.040 --> 48:32.520
and wasn't
prepared to lose another.

My problem is that

50:29.320 --> 50:32.360
you and me had nothing to do
with you and mum splitting up.

50:32.440 --> 50:34.400
How could it?

50:34.480 --> 50:38.120
You came to see me
every other Saturday
for about, what, six months?

50:38.920 --> 50:39.920
You remember that?

50:40.000 --> 50:42.040
I remember.

50:42.120 --> 50:44.520
And do you remember us talking
about the dog you
were going to buy me?

50:46.480 --> 50:49.320
And what we'd do
when I grew up?

50:49.400 --> 50:50.760
You weren't
there every day, but,

50:51.560 --> 50:53.080
I had a dad.

50:53.160 --> 50:56.360
I knew you wanted me,
because you came.

50:56.440 --> 50:57.880
Then one Saturday
you never turned up.

50:57.960 --> 50:59.480
Then three months later,
you turn up drunk,

50:59.560 --> 51:01.440
shouting and screaming

51:01.520 --> 51:04.680
and asking mum to sell
some of our
furniture to give you half.

51:04.760 --> 51:06.520
I didn't see you
again after that.

51:07.880 --> 51:09.240
That was 46 years ago.

51:11.520 --> 51:13.120
You see, old man,

51:13.200 --> 51:15.440
that little boy waiting
for his father to turn up

51:15.520 --> 51:17.880
is still inside
here somewhere.

51:17.960 --> 51:19.160
I'm here for him!

51:19.240 --> 51:20.680
To tell you that
he didn't need you.

51:22.240 --> 51:23.240
That he grew up,

51:24.760 --> 51:26.960
took care of his family,
buried his mother,

51:27.040 --> 51:31.440
that he's got a home,
a life, friends,
people who care about him.

51:33.040 --> 51:34.600
That he survived you.

51:50.360 --> 51:53.200
Is there any
food in this country
that isn't fried?

51:53.280 --> 51:55.360
(LAUGHS)
Hi, Dad.

51:55.440 --> 51:58.720
Ah! Here she is.
Siobhan, this is Humphrey

51:59.440 --> 52:00.480
and Florence.

52:00.560 --> 52:01.600
Very pleased to meet you.

52:01.680 --> 52:02.760
Hello.

52:02.840 --> 52:04.160
Dad's told me all about you.

52:04.240 --> 52:05.480
Yeah, only the good stuff.

52:05.560 --> 52:07.600
So,
you're Dad's unofficial taxi.

52:07.680 --> 52:09.480
You know, whenever Dad needs
to get home from the pub.

52:09.560 --> 52:10.760
(LAUGHS)

52:10.840 --> 52:12.480
What'll I get you?
Lemonade, please.

52:17.000 --> 52:18.880
I've not seen
him smile like this
for a while.

52:18.960 --> 52:21.920
Yes,
he told us about your mum.
I'm so sorry.

52:22.000 --> 52:23.600
I bet he didn't tell you
it was only a month ago.

52:25.200 --> 52:27.080
No, no, he didn't.

52:27.160 --> 52:29.720
He thinks if he makes it sound
like it was a long time ago,

52:29.800 --> 52:30.960
people won't feel
so sorry for him.

52:34.560 --> 52:38.000
So, how did you end up
being a detective
in the Caribbean?

52:38.080 --> 52:39.280
Oh, it's a very long story.

52:39.360 --> 52:41.320
With a happy ending, I hope.

52:41.400 --> 52:42.560
I think it's
still in the balance.

52:44.680 --> 52:46.880
Chief, Sarge.
Where did you get to?

52:46.960 --> 52:49.640
No need to know. This mine?

52:56.360 --> 52:57.760
Here we are, love.
Thank you.

52:57.840 --> 52:59.960
JACK: Dwayne, this is for you.

53:00.040 --> 53:01.600
Rum.

53:01.680 --> 53:03.080
Oh, thank you very much.

53:05.400 --> 53:08.520
So, back to paradise
for you lot tomorrow, is it?

53:08.600 --> 53:09.760
Yes, yes, yes, it is.

53:09.840 --> 53:12.160
I'll drink to that.

53:12.240 --> 53:16.080
Although, strictly speaking,
paradise is a state of mind.

53:16.160 --> 53:18.160
You know that, right?

53:18.240 --> 53:21.560
I mean, the dung beetle,
very different
idea of paradise, doesn't he?

53:21.640 --> 53:23.320
And then you have
the dust mites...
You know what, Jack?

53:26.200 --> 53:27.760
You're absolutely right!

53:28.840 --> 53:29.880
I am?

53:32.360 --> 53:33.400
Chief?

53:36.120 --> 53:38.040
(CLATTERING)
HUMPHREY: Terribly sorry.
My mistake.

53:38.120 --> 53:39.120
Humphrey?

53:45.760 --> 53:48.040
I just wanted to say...

53:48.120 --> 53:51.440
Well, I suddenly realised,
it's all a matter of
perception, really.

53:51.520 --> 53:54.560
Some of us are dung beetles,
some of us are butterflies,

53:55.280 --> 53:57.640
or a parrot.

53:57.720 --> 54:00.560
The thing is,
paradise is very
much what you make it.

54:00.640 --> 54:03.040
Or more to the point,
who you make it with.

54:03.120 --> 54:07.000
The honest,
simple and very plain truth

54:07.080 --> 54:08.800
is that there's no point
me being in the Caribbean,

54:08.880 --> 54:09.920
if you're going
to be over here.

54:11.680 --> 54:13.960
Because where you are
is where my paradise is.

54:14.040 --> 54:16.360
And where you are
is where I want to be.

54:18.320 --> 54:19.320
I love you.

54:21.800 --> 54:23.880
Not quite love you,
or rather love you,

54:23.960 --> 54:25.960
but massively,
heart-pumpingly love you

54:26.040 --> 54:31.680
and I'd like to
stay in London,
with you, forever.

54:33.640 --> 54:35.320
If you'll have me, of course.

54:36.720 --> 54:37.880
Did I say I love you?

54:38.960 --> 54:39.960
Yes.

54:40.960 --> 54:42.360
And the staying bit?

54:46.040 --> 54:47.080
(MARTHA LAUGHS)

54:48.880 --> 54:51.000
I think this is the bit
where you kiss me.

54:52.120 --> 54:53.160
You mean...

55:03.680 --> 55:05.480
What about your job?

55:05.560 --> 55:08.160
Don't worry.
I've got a plan for that.

55:21.440 --> 55:22.960
JACK: Wow, look at this.

55:23.040 --> 55:24.320
SIOBHAN: It's amazing.

55:24.400 --> 55:26.200
JACK: Ah, it's incredible.

55:26.280 --> 55:29.160
Very kind of Humphrey
to let us have
his house like this.

55:29.240 --> 55:31.040
I told him you
needed a holiday.

55:31.120 --> 55:34.240
Well, have to say,
change of scenery,
it's very nice indeed.

55:36.440 --> 55:39.160
There you are.
Ah, cheers!

55:39.240 --> 55:42.360
Oh, there's a pet lizard
we should tell you about.

55:42.440 --> 55:44.280
A lizard?
Harry.

55:44.360 --> 55:46.320
So how will we recognise him?

55:46.400 --> 55:47.760
ALL: He's green.

55:47.840 --> 55:50.040
Right. That narrows it
down a bit. Thank you.

55:50.120 --> 55:51.440
SELWYN: Hello.

55:51.520 --> 55:53.680
DWAYNE: Commissioner!
Sir.

55:53.760 --> 55:56.600
This is Detective
Inspector Jack Mooney

55:56.680 --> 55:57.920
and his daughter, Siobhan.

55:59.760 --> 56:02.360
Inspector Goodman
has told me all about you.

56:02.440 --> 56:04.480
JACK:
Ah, Humphrey's a great fella.

56:04.560 --> 56:06.040
I was just saying
how nice of him it was

56:06.120 --> 56:08.440
to offer us his house
for a couple of weeks.

56:08.520 --> 56:09.840
Though I understand

56:09.920 --> 56:11.480
he's not entirely sure
when he'll be back.

56:12.280 --> 56:14.080
So who knows?

56:14.160 --> 56:15.840
You could take
a little longer.

56:15.920 --> 56:17.280
(LAUGHS)

56:17.360 --> 56:19.760
You don't know my boss.
He's one fierce individual.

56:19.840 --> 56:22.640
I spoke to Chief
Inspector Harris
this afternoon.

56:22.720 --> 56:24.720
Did you?

56:24.800 --> 56:27.320
He wasn't rude to you,
was he? I mean, he
genuinely is a terrible man.

56:27.400 --> 56:28.600
SELWYN:
He spoke very highly of you.

56:29.840 --> 56:32.360
He wasn't drunk, was he?

56:32.440 --> 56:35.120
He said that you should take
all the time you needed.

56:35.200 --> 56:37.120
And if necessary,
we could call it

56:37.200 --> 56:39.000
some kind of
exchange programme.

56:40.160 --> 56:41.480
JACK: Really? Well...

56:41.560 --> 56:44.080
That was very
considerate of him. Yeah!

56:44.160 --> 56:48.000
So, on behalf of the
Saint Marie Police Department,

56:48.080 --> 56:51.560
Detective Inspector, Siobhan,

56:51.640 --> 56:53.160
welcome to paradise.

56:55.880 --> 56:57.160
ALL: Welcome to paradise!

57:09.120 --> 57:10.680
This festival I
keep hearing about...

57:10.760 --> 57:12.600
FLORENCE: St Ursula's Day.

57:12.680 --> 57:14.720
DWAYNE: You drink a lot of rum
and party
wildly in the street.

57:14.800 --> 57:16.320
Ay-yi-yi!

57:16.400 --> 57:18.080
I have some very
important information

57:18.160 --> 57:19.720
about the murder
of Julie Matlock.

57:19.800 --> 57:21.680
You got the wrong person.

57:21.760 --> 57:24.600
Inspector, you answered
the call to arms, I see.

57:24.680 --> 57:26.600
So what do we do now?
Reopen the case.

57:26.680 --> 57:28.400
If every police
officer looked like you,

57:28.480 --> 57:30.200
I wouldn't mind
being arrested.

57:30.280 --> 57:33.680
Unfortunately, Tony,
most police
officers look like me.

57:33.760 --> 57:35.720
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)
