11:54.147 --> 11:55.947
- No.

11:56.082 --> 11:57.949
- Um, look, you guys,

11:58.018 --> 11:59.884
You guys go home after this,
okay?

11:59.920 --> 12:02.020
River: We will.

12:02.022 --> 12:05.156
Happy holidays, jenny!
Dennis: Happy holidays, jenny.

12:05.158 --> 12:07.392
Jenny: Happy holidays, guys.

12:08.495 --> 12:10.027
Donovan: Sorry, what?

12:10.063 --> 12:12.363
Jenny: John browning and flora
both have cysts

12:12.365 --> 12:14.632
From old tapeworm infections.
- And?

12:14.768 --> 12:17.301
- What if the whole family
had tapeworm at some point?

12:17.370 --> 12:20.038
Tapeworm larvae can travel
to your-your organs

12:20.040 --> 12:22.774
And your muscles,
and they can cause cysts.

12:23.810 --> 12:27.512
So, I'm thinking that caleb
browning has tapeworm cysts

12:27.514 --> 12:30.114
In his brain. And if it's
in his frontal lobe,

12:30.183 --> 12:33.050
Then that would explain why
he can't control his emotions.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.986
- All right, then, why wouldn't
the rest of the family

12:35.121 --> 12:36.621
Be violent?
Why wouldn't aaron be?

12:36.756 --> 12:38.189
- Because it's incredibly rare

12:38.191 --> 12:39.991
For the cysts to travel
to your brain.

12:39.993 --> 12:41.526
- Hold on for a sec, jenny.

12:41.661 --> 12:43.061
- We got a list of properties
the brownings own.

12:43.196 --> 12:44.863
Places where caleb
could be hiding out.

12:44.865 --> 12:46.664
Closest is some land north
of pickering.

12:46.733 --> 12:48.666
- All right, thanks, man.
Hey, jenny?

12:48.735 --> 12:50.702
I think I might have a lead on
where caleb might be hiding.

12:50.837 --> 12:52.603
- Okay, I need to come with you.

12:52.739 --> 12:54.972

- yeah, donovan,

12:54.974 --> 12:56.775
I know he's dangerous,
but he's also sick,

12:56.910 --> 12:58.609
And if I can explain
that to him,

12:58.645 --> 13:01.145
I think he will accept help.
- All right, fine.

13:01.214 --> 13:02.881
I'll text you the address.

13:02.883 --> 13:04.783

I'll meet you there.

Hmm?

13:13.560 --> 13:15.960

13:15.996 --> 13:18.563

13:18.565 --> 13:21.699
She went on her first date...

13:21.701 --> 13:23.902

lived right?

36:41.099 --> 36:44.166

this right here.

39:00.038 --> 39:01.638
