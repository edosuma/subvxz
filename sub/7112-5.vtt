Mom! Phineas and Ferb are

00:57.800 --> 00:59.260
Jeremy is so cute,

00:59.540 --> 01:01.860
especially when he's in his
Mr. Slushy Dawg Uniform.

01:02.130 --> 01:02.630
Candace,

01:02.820 --> 01:05.670
my jazz trio has a gig at the
Squat 'n Stitch today.

01:05.800 --> 01:08.320
Why don't you, Phineas and Ferb
hang out at the mall together?

01:08.350 --> 01:09.170
The mall?

01:10.040 --> 01:12.160
I can visit Jeremy at
Mr. Slushy Dawg!

01:13.020 --> 01:14.020
Testing.

01:14.200 --> 01:15.220
Welcome everyone, uh,

01:15.370 --> 01:17.370
we'll be playing some free
formed jazz today.

01:17.700 --> 01:19.080
It might get a little crazy, so,

01:19.340 --> 01:20.980
hold on to those knitting needles.

01:21.240 --> 01:22.090
Hit it girls!

01:24.230 --> 01:25.480
All right, squirts.
Here's your cut.

01:25.540 --> 01:26.718
I'll see you back here in 2 hours.

01:26.719 --> 01:27.730
Now, if you'll excuse me,

01:28.010 --> 01:29.370
I'm going to Mr. Slushy Dawg.

01:30.330 --> 01:31.610
Hey, where's Perry?

01:33.000 --> 01:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:44.850 --> 01:46.160
Sorry about that, Agent P.

01:46.320 --> 01:49.260
Our slide waxing guy has Jury
duty this weekend. Anyhow,

01:49.660 --> 01:51.810
Doofenshmirtz has purchased some
suspicious items,

01:52.070 --> 01:53.210
4 helicopter blades,

01:53.330 --> 01:55.310
2 dozen party ballons,
and Light bulbs.

01:55.640 --> 01:56.990
6000 of them.

01:57.270 --> 02:00.000
He's hiding out at the old abandoned
cake factory on the edge of T...

02:00.490 --> 02:03.140
Carl, the light bulb and the "6000".

02:03.560 --> 02:06.380
- Still on the screen.
- Ah, thanks Carl.

02:06.610 --> 02:09.229
Locate Doofenshmirtz and
figure out what he's up to.

02:09.370 --> 02:10.919
Don't fail us, Agent P.

02:15.850 --> 02:17.290
- Oh, hey Candace.
- Hey.

02:17.510 --> 02:19.040
My cell phone appears to be ringing.

02:19.310 --> 02:20.690
Whoops! My camera went off!

02:25.920 --> 02:28.410
Well,
that was an interesting experiment.

02:28.570 --> 02:30.790
Excuse me, but why are
you not studying?

02:31.090 --> 02:32.220
It's summer vacation.

02:33.440 --> 02:35.380
You know, no school, and
teachers aren't around,

02:35.390 --> 02:37.190
and all you have to worry about
are bullies?

02:41.010 --> 02:42.200
Eh, Buford?

02:42.340 --> 02:43.520
That seat's kinda taken.

02:43.670 --> 02:45.120
This table's taken.

02:45.280 --> 02:46.470
Sit somewhere else.

02:46.640 --> 02:47.720
What about Baljeet?

02:47.880 --> 02:48.460
Please go.

02:48.600 --> 02:50.190
You will just make him angry.

02:53.030 --> 02:54.050
AIEE!

02:58.320 --> 02:59.660
This is gonna hurt.

02:59.930 --> 03:01.630
Hey! Put him down!

03:01.920 --> 03:03.110
Do as she says!

03:03.850 --> 03:06.520
Violence can only lead
to more violence.

03:06.570 --> 03:08.008
Sounds good to me.

03:08.009 --> 03:08.830
Hold it!

03:08.930 --> 03:11.910
World heavyweight boxing champion
Evander Holyfield?

03:12.030 --> 03:14.220
Aren't you a little old to be
a professional boxer?

03:14.310 --> 03:17.150
- Yes. Yes I am.
- Cool.

03:17.440 --> 03:18.370
If you have to fight,

03:18.780 --> 03:21.800
do it time-honored way,
out behind the mall at 3 o'clock.

03:21.890 --> 03:23.390
Uh, Ferb. How's our 3 o'clock?

03:24.780 --> 03:27.020
- We'll be there.
- Don't be late.

03:27.430 --> 03:29.520
My Mom's pickin' me up at 4.

03:29.660 --> 03:31.530
It looks like we
found something to do today.

03:31.680 --> 03:36.000
What you have found is a One-way magic
carpet ride to your own destruction.

03:36.110 --> 03:36.690
He's right.

03:36.960 --> 03:39.330
Remember what happened
to the last kid Buford fought?

03:39.630 --> 03:41.900
You win this round, Buford.

03:42.050 --> 03:43.730
I don't want that to happen to you.

03:43.970 --> 03:45.860
It won't, 'cause I'm gonna train him.

04:33.310 --> 04:34.940
"The Brawl at the mall"?

04:37.070 --> 04:38.450
What do you two think your doing?

04:38.540 --> 04:41.540
You can't just go building a boxing ring
out here in the parking lot!

04:41.780 --> 04:43.410
I'm telling Mom right now!

04:48.690 --> 04:50.890
Mom, Phineas and Ferb are at it again!

04:51.030 --> 04:52.160
Not now, Candace.

04:52.161 --> 04:53.160
Oh, my solo!

04:53.920 --> 04:55.580
Oh, I need proof.

04:56.030 --> 04:56.600
The flyer!

05:04.470 --> 05:05.670
Perry the Platypus!

05:05.780 --> 05:08.070
I trapped you in a giant bowl
filled to the brim

05:08.440 --> 05:10.250
with Doonkle Berry cake mix.

05:10.490 --> 05:11.090
You see,

05:11.230 --> 05:13.430
today is my birthday!

05:15.370 --> 05:17.600
Struggle all you want,
Perry the Platypus.

05:17.930 --> 05:19.540
But in 30 to 40 minutes,

05:19.640 --> 05:23.210
the yeas will rise,
and you'll be berried alive!

05:24.130 --> 05:24.840
Here, have some.

05:25.160 --> 05:28.900
Unfortunately, my birthday has always
been the lousiest day of the year.

05:29.160 --> 05:32.070
It all began on the day
of my actual birth.

05:32.370 --> 05:34.790
Both of my parents failed to show up.

05:35.040 --> 05:38.580
By the age of 5, I was forced
to throw my own surprise party.

05:38.750 --> 05:39.880
At Gunther Goat Cheeses.

05:40.320 --> 05:43.050
The goat-cheesiest place in all
of Druselstein.

05:43.460 --> 05:45.220
Many of my closest friends were there.

05:45.600 --> 05:47.670
Count Wolfgang, Betty the She-Boar,

05:48.110 --> 05:50.090
Raputin, and the licekins,

05:50.340 --> 05:51.370
Olga and Chicago Joe.

05:54.460 --> 05:55.570
Hello, Boys and...

05:55.690 --> 05:56.230
Oh.

05:56.450 --> 05:57.950
Hmm... Awkward.

05:58.770 --> 06:01.030
Uh, hey kid, lock up
when your done, OK?

06:01.740 --> 06:04.900
But one should never walk the
paths of Druselstein.

06:05.140 --> 06:07.060
With uncovered Doonkle Berry cake,

06:07.410 --> 06:10.200
lest the Doonkle Berry bats' swarm.

06:12.850 --> 06:13.520
But this year,

06:13.730 --> 06:16.300
I won't be celebrating
my birthday alone.

06:16.930 --> 06:20.320
Behold, the Slave-Inator!

06:20.830 --> 06:24.160
You see, the crowd will do whatever the
Slave-Inator tells them to do!

06:28.000 --> 06:30.610
I even have a Cleanup party button,
Because

06:30.710 --> 06:33.050
the worst part of a party
is the cleanup, am I right?

06:34.080 --> 06:35.620
Farewell, Perry the Platypus,

06:36.070 --> 06:39.280
and Happy Birthday to Me!

06:58.550 --> 07:00.560
Ladies and Gentlemen,

07:00.730 --> 07:01.890
Boys and Girls,

07:02.160 --> 07:03.470
he's from a bad home,

07:03.610 --> 07:05.210
he's missing a chromosome,

07:05.480 --> 07:06.420
Buford

07:06.540 --> 07:07.980
the Bully!

07:08.270 --> 07:09.750
And in this corner,

07:09.880 --> 07:10.560
he's got moves,

07:10.770 --> 07:11.840
he's got grace,

07:14.350 --> 07:15.040
fabulous...

07:15.220 --> 07:16.680
Phineas...

07:16.920 --> 07:17.820
Flynn!

07:18.160 --> 07:18.670
Okay boys.

07:18.671 --> 07:21.690
Let's have a fair and square fight,
and in no way should this ensuing fight

07:21.700 --> 07:23.825
contain the image of a
potentially harmful, hurtful,

07:23.846 --> 07:25.570
or psychologically
disturbing physical act,

07:25.571 --> 07:28.300
that could be found imitatable
by an impressionable child viewer.

07:28.500 --> 07:29.100
Aw!

07:29.340 --> 07:30.210
Boys and Girls,

07:30.430 --> 07:34.120
let's get ready to Thumb Wrestle!

07:34.250 --> 07:35.538
Sorry, we're out of flyers.

07:35.539 --> 07:36.160
- Poster?
- Nope.

07:36.210 --> 07:37.160
- Action figure?
- Sold out.

07:37.180 --> 07:38.200
- Commerative coin?
- All gone.

07:38.250 --> 07:39.890
- 8 by 10 glossy photo?
- Those sold like hot cakes.

07:39.910 --> 07:41.100
- Photo!
- Yes!

07:41.380 --> 07:42.740
Photographic evidence!

07:59.410 --> 08:01.010
Perry the Platypus!

08:01.530 --> 08:04.700
Well, if your gonna crash my party,
your gonna need a party hat.

08:04.840 --> 08:07.610
A party hat of doom!

08:18.440 --> 08:19.500
2... 3... 4...

08:19.960 --> 08:21.660
I declare a thumb war!

08:22.040 --> 08:23.220
The fighters spring to life,

08:23.410 --> 08:24.890
they're squaring up to each other,

08:25.250 --> 08:25.800
YOW!

08:26.060 --> 08:27.260
Flynn hits the mat!

08:27.420 --> 08:28.810
Buford got him where he wants him,

08:28.811 --> 08:30.300
and look, and Oh!

08:30.370 --> 08:31.730
Into the turnbuckle!

08:32.240 --> 08:33.010
Clothesline!

08:33.169 --> 08:34.190
That can't feel good!

08:34.289 --> 08:36.100
Hold onto your seats folks,

08:36.210 --> 08:38.039
this one's gonna be brutal!

08:48.990 --> 08:50.960
Still hanging around,
Perry the Platypus?

08:53.040 --> 08:54.610
Oooooooooo...

08:54.720 --> 08:55.680
Why don't you let go?

08:56.040 --> 08:57.350
Doesn't it hurt your fingers?

08:57.970 --> 08:59.980
I don't think this is going so well.

09:00.590 --> 09:01.190
Nonsense kid.

09:01.380 --> 09:02.020
Go for the gold!

09:02.120 --> 09:03.060
Fight fire with fire!

09:03.200 --> 09:04.670
Aw, shoot. Shoot him the stink-eye!

09:04.830 --> 09:05.980
Uh, Grease the pig!

09:06.300 --> 09:07.200
Ah, I got nothing.

09:09.280 --> 09:09.900
A right hook!

09:10.000 --> 09:11.230
A darting left jab!

09:12.930 --> 09:14.100
Photo, photo, photo.

09:14.300 --> 09:15.740
Buford is climbing the turnbuckles!

09:15.790 --> 09:17.290
He's on the top rope!

09:18.730 --> 09:19.410
Oh!

09:19.640 --> 09:22.610
The dreaded Boston belt sander!

09:24.820 --> 09:25.620
Mom!

09:26.370 --> 09:26.880
Finally,

09:27.240 --> 09:30.380
indisputable photographic evidence
of dangerous and irresponsible behavior.

09:30.510 --> 09:31.110
Candace,

09:31.420 --> 09:33.490
this is your thumb in front of the lens.

09:34.900 --> 09:35.440
AAH!

09:35.640 --> 09:37.590
Oh, you are coming with me!

09:37.860 --> 09:39.580
And now, Perry the Platypus,

09:39.680 --> 09:42.820
I will smudge your face with ice cream!

09:43.620 --> 09:45.170
Wait, W-what are you doing?

09:46.150 --> 09:46.800
What is that?

09:50.130 --> 09:51.310
NO!

09:51.540 --> 09:52.070
Wait!

09:52.270 --> 09:53.520
NO!

09:53.920 --> 09:55.650
Oh, the humanity!

09:56.020 --> 09:57.240
Flynn falls hard!

09:57.440 --> 09:59.170
The crowd's on it's feet!

09:59.360 --> 10:00.340
It's over!

10:01.870 --> 10:03.710
It's all over!

10:04.020 --> 10:09.090
<i>♪ Our hero's on the rope and now
it's looking like the end! ♪</i>

10:12.700 --> 10:14.170
Ice cream fell on you!

10:18.180 --> 10:18.760
Whaddya say?

10:19.040 --> 10:19.900
Even Steven?

10:20.160 --> 10:20.800
Sure Buford.

10:20.970 --> 10:21.830
Even Steven.

10:22.350 --> 10:22.930
Wait!

10:23.030 --> 10:24.330
How did you do th...

10:25.390 --> 10:27.340
Hey, where did that whale come from?

10:27.470 --> 10:29.140
Oh, this is the worst party ever!

10:29.510 --> 10:30.350
Aah!

10:30.780 --> 10:32.420
My birthday cake!

10:34.290 --> 10:36.090
Goodbye, Perry the Platypus!

10:36.400 --> 10:38.400
At least I still have my cake!

10:40.830 --> 10:43.500
Curse you, Perry the platypus!

10:45.890 --> 10:46.390
Hey,

10:46.420 --> 10:48.560
I have a strange urge
to clean up this mess.

10:48.680 --> 10:49.330
Me too.

10:49.430 --> 10:50.050
Let's do it.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.770
I'll take care of the whale.

10:53.500 --> 10:55.220
Thank you, Mr. Holyfield.

10:55.390 --> 10:55.908
Yeah.

10:55.909 --> 10:57.428
Wouldn't have been real without you.

10:57.429 --> 10:59.210
Happy to help you boys find a slightly

10:59.310 --> 11:01.290
less valid way to settle
your differences.

11:02.290 --> 11:03.150
There you are, Perry.

11:05.100 --> 11:06.170
See?!

11:06.500 --> 11:07.050
Hi, Mom!

11:07.200 --> 11:07.930
Hi, boys!

11:08.510 --> 11:09.890
If you'll excuse me Candace,

11:10.120 --> 11:11.860
I'm gonna get back for the 2nd set.

11:14.480 --> 11:15.110
Hey Dinnerbell,

11:15.440 --> 11:17.100
That was the best battle ever.

11:17.410 --> 11:18.310
Same thing tomorrow?

11:18.360 --> 11:18.960
Nah.

11:19.230 --> 11:20.580
I like to keep moving forward.

11:20.810 --> 11:22.660
Sharks have to continue to move forward,

11:22.940 --> 11:23.630
or they'll drown.

11:23.890 --> 11:25.800
You calling me a shark?

11:27.380 --> 11:28.090
Blagh!

11:29.020 --> 11:29.970
Ferb!

11:30.610 --> 11:32.300
Well, he was all up on my face.

11:33.070 --> 11:34.220
What happened?

11:38.880 --> 11:41.910
