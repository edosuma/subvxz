01:15.533 --> 01:16.910
Next.

01:16.993 --> 01:20.163
Finally. The only thing
I wait in lines this long for

01:20.246 --> 01:21.790
are slightly better cell phones.

01:21.873 --> 01:24.209
Why do we even have
to go to this stupid wedding?

01:24.292 --> 01:27.462
Cousin Kathy invited us
so our feelings wouldn't be hurt.

01:27.545 --> 01:30.298
And we're going so her feelings
won't be hurt.

01:30.381 --> 01:33.134
I just don't understand
the world of grown-ups.

01:35.178 --> 01:37.806
Sorry, sir, your bag
is two pounds over the limit.

01:37.889 --> 01:39.766
Are you sure everything
inside is essential?

01:39.849 --> 01:40.934
Absolutely.

01:41.017 --> 01:42.811
Let me just redistribute
our thingies

01:42.894 --> 01:44.979
amongst our various bags.

01:46.856 --> 01:48.650
High school yearbooks...

01:48.733 --> 01:50.860
I told you not to pack them!

01:50.944 --> 01:53.863
(quietly) Don't argue in front
of the airport line.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.949
Strangers are judging
our marriage!

01:56.032 --> 01:58.910
Lisa, do you really need all
these Kurt Vonnegut novels?

01:58.993 --> 02:00.453
They self-reference each other.

02:00.537 --> 02:04.415
Marge, do we really need
all these feminine products?

02:04.499 --> 02:05.792
That's toothpaste!

02:05.875 --> 02:07.377
Yes, but I never use
that kind of toothpaste!

02:07.460 --> 02:09.796
Why don't you put one
of those weights in that bag

02:09.879 --> 02:11.840
and put the other one
in that bag?

02:11.923 --> 02:13.591
(satisfied chuckle)

02:13.675 --> 02:15.135
Try to catch one
on your tongue.

02:15.218 --> 02:16.803
LISA:
We're not with him.

02:20.056 --> 02:23.184
We'll need to have a special
agent check this out.

02:25.061 --> 02:27.021
-(belches)
-You're clear.

02:27.105 --> 02:28.982
Now I have
to change the nipple.

02:29.065 --> 02:30.817
True patriots breast-feed.

02:30.900 --> 02:31.985
(groans)

02:32.068 --> 02:33.903
Sir, you've been
selected for a pat-down.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.489
Whoo-hoo! Can you focus
on my shoulders?

02:36.573 --> 02:38.908
That's where
I carry my stress.

02:38.992 --> 02:42.245
Now, if I fart,
that's 'cause I'm so relaxed.

02:42.328 --> 02:44.038
(humming)

02:44.122 --> 02:45.665
Sir, there isn't enough room.

Yes, there is!

Sir, return to your seat.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.381
But I have
to go to the bathroom.

03:35.465 --> 03:36.507
You should have thought of that

03:36.591 --> 03:38.635

You can check my carry-on,
but you can't check my spirit.

04:36.442 --> 04:39.070
And why is there moisture
between the windows?

04:39.153 --> 04:41.447

to call shotgun.

05:05.847 --> 05:07.557
It's never too early
to call shotgun.

05:07.640 --> 05:08.725
No one's shotgun!

05:08.808 --> 05:10.893
Now, be quiet.

06:31.682 --> 06:33.351
bottled up inside is dead.

This is the birth

goes to church twice a year,

08:12.909 --> 08:14.327

08:14.410 --> 08:16.329
'cause he likes
to hear them grunt.

08:16.412 --> 08:18.873
I bet Chuck the cameraman
and Steve the sound guy

08:18.956 --> 08:21.083
know where I'm coming from.

08:22.960 --> 08:25.004
Yeah, that's what I'm
talking about.

08:25.087 --> 08:27.131
Those real people out there

who buy their coffee
from the mini-mart

08:29.759 --> 08:32.011

for a week.

08:38.309 --> 08:40.061
Find me a rich
husband-- quick!

08:40.144 --> 08:42.730
Dad, you out-talked
the talking heads.

08:42.813 --> 08:44.273
From now on,
when someone asks me,

08:44.357 --> 08:46.567
I'm going to say you are
my father.

08:46.651 --> 08:47.860
Aw, son.

08:47.944 --> 08:50.988
Now I regret bad-mouthing you
to that girl you liked.

08:51.072 --> 08:52.990
Homer,
the way you just demolished

08:53.074 --> 08:56.327

on-air personality was...

08:56.410 --> 08:57.995

You are the kind
of ill-informed gasbag

09:00.581 --> 09:02.458
this network
cannot get enough of.

09:02.542 --> 09:03.793
We only have 11 now.

Well, what you do is take

09:22.436 --> 09:24.188
a derogatory term
and think of other words

09:24.272 --> 09:25.856
-that start with the same letter.
-Hmm.

09:25.940 --> 09:27.358
Homer, you're getting
your own show.

09:27.441 --> 09:28.609
Finally.

09:28.693 --> 09:30.695
But I want to do it my way:

09:30.778 --> 09:33.447
classy and sophisticated.

09:33.531 --> 09:35.950
Welcome to <i>Gut Check</i>
<i>with Homer Simpson!</i>

09:36.033 --> 09:40.162
<i>Where the truth is served</i>
<i>with a side of... in your face.</i>

09:45.209 --> 09:46.877
I am Homer Simpson.

09:46.961 --> 09:49.255
(chickens clucking)

09:49.338 --> 09:52.466
America's latest teller of truth
with a book deal on the side.

09:52.550 --> 09:54.218
Audio book read by Lenny.

09:54.302 --> 09:56.345
I'm not just another loudmouth.

09:56.429 --> 09:59.724
I'm a loudmouth who says things
you're afraid to say,

09:59.807 --> 10:01.976
but not racist things!

10:03.561 --> 10:04.812
Let's go to the map.

10:04.895 --> 10:06.647
Zoomy, zoomy, zoomy.

10:06.731 --> 10:08.733
Dateline: Nebraska.

10:08.816 --> 10:10.901
A high school principal
has decided

10:10.985 --> 10:14.113
that football is too dangerous,

10:14.196 --> 10:17.158
so he's replacing it
with... soccer.

10:19.535 --> 10:21.245
Are you ready
for Irish announcers

10:21.329 --> 10:22.830
with lyrical accents?

10:22.913 --> 10:24.665
"Oh, that's a lovely touch.

10:24.749 --> 10:26.876
Oh, such a beautiful form."

10:26.959 --> 10:29.545
If we lose football,

10:29.629 --> 10:32.506
we lose the blitz, cheerleaders,

10:32.590 --> 10:35.176
Rudys, Ochocincos,

10:35.259 --> 10:38.387
something for fat kids to play.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.139
(sobbing)

10:40.222 --> 10:42.266
Ochocincos.

10:42.350 --> 10:44.477
(sobbing)

10:46.687 --> 10:48.439
Oh, yeah, that's right.

10:48.522 --> 10:49.607
It's already happening, people.

10:49.690 --> 10:52.026
Hoard your toilet paper.

10:52.109 --> 10:53.527
Shoot the mailman!

10:53.611 --> 10:56.614
(sobbing)
Shoot the mailman.

10:56.697 --> 10:59.116
Is it a little weird
how much he cries?

10:59.200 --> 11:01.702
No way. When a guy
who loves America cries,

11:01.786 --> 11:03.454
it makes him super straight.

11:04.246 --> 11:06.040
This is going so great.

11:06.123 --> 11:07.792
I'm already
a Halloween mask!

11:10.544 --> 11:11.671
That's not you.

11:11.754 --> 11:13.631
They just painted Shrek yellow.

11:14.757 --> 11:16.967
It's still a great honor.

11:17.051 --> 11:19.136
Dad, I'm glad your show
is successful,

11:19.220 --> 11:22.640
but I have to ask you:
what's with the crying?

11:22.723 --> 11:24.266
Great question.

11:24.350 --> 11:27.645
I know you children have never
seen your father cry before.

11:27.728 --> 11:29.271
Marge, do we have
any more gravy?

11:29.355 --> 11:30.648
No, we're out.

11:30.731 --> 11:32.149
(sobbing)
Why?

11:32.233 --> 11:33.818
Oh, why?!

11:35.653 --> 11:37.405
Homie, I'm glad
you're passionate,

11:37.488 --> 11:40.408
I just hope you're not
riling people up with your show.

11:40.491 --> 11:42.535
Oh, Marge, don't worry.

11:42.618 --> 11:44.662
People know
I'm doing a character,

11:44.745 --> 11:48.082
like Stephen Colbert
or Newt Gingrich.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.669
Welcome back
to <i>Gut Check.</i>

11:51.752 --> 11:55.464
I have something very, very
pro-American to share with you.

11:55.548 --> 11:56.632
Come with me.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.384
D'oh!
Death to America!

11:58.467 --> 11:59.760
I mean, over here.

11:59.844 --> 12:01.971
You all know I'm a big fan
of American meat.

12:02.054 --> 12:05.766
Although, sometimes you got
to cut off some of the gristle.

12:05.850 --> 12:08.519
(roars)

12:08.602 --> 12:11.063
Take that,
centers of art and commerce!

12:11.147 --> 12:13.733
And this country has something
extra that makes our meat

12:13.816 --> 12:16.193
the juiciest,
most melt-in-your-mouth,

12:16.277 --> 12:18.362
stay-in-your-heart meat
in the world.

12:18.446 --> 12:22.533
That's right, I'm talking about
the gravy of freedom.

12:24.118 --> 12:27.747
When March Madness spills
into April, that's the gravy.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.123
When someone messes with you,

12:29.206 --> 12:32.334
and you invade the country
that did it plus another one,

12:32.418 --> 12:33.961
that's the gravy.

12:34.044 --> 12:36.213
When you stick your flag
in the moon

12:36.297 --> 12:41.135
and say "Now we're done trying,"
that's the gravy!

12:41.218 --> 12:43.471
So get on the boat.

12:43.554 --> 12:45.222
The gravy boat!

12:45.306 --> 12:48.476
Good night and good gravy.

12:48.559 --> 12:50.978
Great show, people.
Great show.

12:51.061 --> 12:53.773
Um... not a big deal,
but next time,

12:53.856 --> 12:56.192
can we use real gravy
instead of brown paint?

12:56.275 --> 12:57.610
Not a big deal.

12:57.693 --> 13:00.321
So, what's this
with the gravy boat?

13:00.404 --> 13:02.531
Just an innocuous little symbol,

13:02.615 --> 13:05.576
like a smiley face
or like an I.O.U.

13:05.659 --> 13:08.579
You know, symbols can often
rile people up.

13:08.662 --> 13:11.582
The swastika,
the New York Yankees logo.

13:11.665 --> 13:13.918
(laughs)
Oh. Don't worry, sweetie.

13:14.001 --> 13:16.545
I think I know how
to whip up an audience

13:16.629 --> 13:17.922
just short of a frenzy.

13:30.935 --> 13:34.438
(clamoring)

13:39.610 --> 13:41.529
Why did I make this
a loss leader?

13:44.698 --> 13:47.243
The gravy boat movement
is spreading across the nation

13:47.326 --> 13:49.787
like a rumor about
some kid and someone's mom

13:49.870 --> 13:51.163
hooking up at a high school.

13:51.247 --> 13:53.082
With the presidential primaries
coming up

13:53.165 --> 13:54.917
and an entrenched incumbent
in office,

13:55.000 --> 13:57.253
Republican leaders
have no choice but to court

13:57.336 --> 14:01.549
this movement's inglorious
baster, Homer Simpson.

14:01.632 --> 14:03.467
Marge, I'm going to meet with

14:03.551 --> 14:06.262
the Republican establishment
and pick their nominee.

14:06.345 --> 14:09.640
If there's sandwiches there,
you want me to bring some back?

14:09.723 --> 14:11.767
Speaking for Lisa and me,

14:11.851 --> 14:15.354
we're not really
110% behind you anymore.

14:15.437 --> 14:17.773
Then what percent above 100
are you behind me?

14:17.857 --> 14:18.941
Um, none.

14:19.024 --> 14:21.527
Only 100%?!
(groans)

14:21.610 --> 14:23.070
Homie, I love you,

14:23.153 --> 14:25.781
and I'm glad we're finally
using our wedding china,

14:25.865 --> 14:27.199
but when you're helping to pick

14:27.283 --> 14:29.785
the next leader
of the free world...

14:29.869 --> 14:31.078
Dad, you shouldn't do this.

14:31.161 --> 14:33.539
It's not fair
how much influence you have.

14:33.622 --> 14:36.208
Now, Lisa,
I'm an entertainer.

14:36.292 --> 14:39.461
And you can't entertain
and inform at the same time.

14:39.545 --> 14:41.422
And if you're <i>Access Hollywood,</i>
you do neither.

14:41.505 --> 14:43.173
(chuckles)

14:44.466 --> 14:47.052
(thunder rumbles)

14:47.136 --> 14:49.889
Hmm. Hmm.

14:49.972 --> 14:51.932
Now, they're all
excellent choices,

14:52.016 --> 14:54.560
so simply pick the white male
candidate you prefer

14:54.643 --> 14:55.644
and we'll elect him.

14:55.728 --> 14:58.856
I don't know. Can't we get
Chris Christie to run?

14:58.939 --> 15:00.608
I don't think so.

15:01.609 --> 15:04.361
(choking)

15:04.445 --> 15:06.906
Save me, ObamaCare!

15:06.989 --> 15:09.575
Yeah, maybe I'll vote Democrat.

15:09.658 --> 15:11.452
The great thing is,
when they get in,

15:11.535 --> 15:12.912
they act like Republicans.

15:12.995 --> 15:16.582
MAN: No one's voting Democrat
while I can still draw a bow.

15:16.665 --> 15:18.083
(gasps)

15:19.209 --> 15:20.753
(gasps)

15:20.836 --> 15:22.922
Ted Nugent.

15:23.005 --> 15:26.467
I made love on my honeymoon
to your sweet music.

15:26.550 --> 15:27.927
You're my man!

15:28.010 --> 15:31.013
You're endorsing Ted Nugent
for president?

15:31.096 --> 15:34.183
He's a right-wing rock star
who likes everything I hate!

15:34.266 --> 15:36.185
Could there be anyone awesomer?

15:36.268 --> 15:37.853
Who's hungry for elk?

15:38.687 --> 15:40.522
(screams)

15:40.606 --> 15:41.941
Hmm.

15:42.024 --> 15:44.276
My daughter's a vegetarian.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.487
That's all right,
she can munch on an antler.

15:46.570 --> 15:48.530
Antlers ain't meat.

15:53.619 --> 15:55.037
I thought I smelled
death-a-diddly.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.580
What is that,
an eight-pointer?

15:56.664 --> 15:57.873
From the looks
of that mustache,

15:57.957 --> 15:59.583
I'm guessing you're
a tenured professor

15:59.667 --> 16:01.418
at the People's Republic
of Berkeley.

16:01.502 --> 16:04.421
Hey, the only left-wing thing
about me is the way I write.

16:04.505 --> 16:06.632
(grunts)
Oh, that's just fine,

16:06.715 --> 16:09.009
as long as you're
not a Mormon.

16:09.093 --> 16:11.762
Dad, you cannot
endorse Ted Nugent.

16:11.845 --> 16:13.430
I mean, sure,
we all love his music...

16:13.514 --> 16:14.598
-Oh, yeah.
-No question about it.

16:14.682 --> 16:15.891
-I love that guy.
-We listen to it.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.059
But he's out of his mind!

16:17.142 --> 16:18.769
He can't run for president!

16:18.852 --> 16:20.854
I bagged me a fat little badger.

16:20.938 --> 16:23.524
Please, kind sir, have pity.

16:23.607 --> 16:26.193
All I hear is
"chitter-chitter."

16:28.362 --> 16:30.447
(snoring)

16:32.866 --> 16:34.952
(snoring)

16:35.035 --> 16:36.829
MAN:
Arise, Homer Simpson!

16:36.912 --> 16:38.372
Huh? Who's there?

16:40.958 --> 16:42.501
(screams)
Mozart!

16:42.584 --> 16:44.795
-I am James Madison, sir.
-(screams)

16:44.878 --> 16:47.381
Fourth president
of these United States.

16:47.464 --> 16:48.757
-Ooh.
-Now, come,

16:48.841 --> 16:50.884
and I shall teach
you of democracy.

16:50.968 --> 16:52.302
Can we get some pizza
on the way?

16:52.386 --> 16:53.554
Everything's closed.

16:53.637 --> 16:55.305
They sell some
at the gas station.

16:55.389 --> 16:57.891
I don't want
gas station pizza.

16:58.976 --> 17:01.645
(whinnies)

17:01.729 --> 17:04.523
So, how come your picture's
not on money?

17:04.606 --> 17:06.775
Actually,
I'm on the $5,000 bill.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.485
Do you give them out
for fans?

17:08.569 --> 17:09.486
'Cause I'm a fan.

17:11.780 --> 17:14.116
I want to show you something.

17:16.201 --> 17:17.202
What's this?

17:17.286 --> 17:19.788
Some kind of
bicentennial lemon party?

17:19.872 --> 17:22.207
These are the framers
of the Constitution, Homer.

17:22.291 --> 17:25.085
This great nation is built upon
the hard work of,

17:25.169 --> 17:27.379
well, as you would say, nerds.

17:27.463 --> 17:28.547
Nerds!

17:28.630 --> 17:30.049
You want I should mess them up?

17:30.132 --> 17:32.301
I want you
should not mess!

17:32.384 --> 17:35.095
You are an embarrassment
to the aristocratic slaveholders

17:35.179 --> 17:36.889
who forged this mighty nation.

17:36.972 --> 17:38.974
But gravy
is the freedom where...

17:39.058 --> 17:41.560
Silence!
Founding Fathers, to me!

17:42.728 --> 17:44.146
(grunting)

17:44.229 --> 17:46.065
(gasps)

17:46.148 --> 17:49.568
"Congress shall have the power
to lay and collect taxes"?!

17:49.651 --> 17:51.570
"No new states shall be formed

17:51.653 --> 17:53.614
"or erected
within the jurisdiction

17:53.697 --> 17:56.658
of any other state"?!

17:56.742 --> 17:58.410
No, no, John Hancock.

17:58.494 --> 17:59.745
I don't need insurance.

17:59.828 --> 18:02.748
Sam Adams, I'm sorry
I made fun of your winter ale.

18:02.831 --> 18:03.791
Homie, wake up.

18:03.874 --> 18:05.667
(gasps)
It was all a dream.

18:05.751 --> 18:08.045
Oh, Marge,
Oscar Madison came to me

18:08.128 --> 18:11.799
and told me that politics
are serious and important!

18:11.882 --> 18:12.800
(yawns)

18:12.883 --> 18:14.051
Lisa, you were right!

18:14.134 --> 18:17.221
I'm not going to endorse
anybody for anything.

18:17.304 --> 18:19.473
(kids screaming)

18:23.977 --> 18:25.395
(muffled grunting)

18:25.479 --> 18:26.897
Oh, Dad!

18:26.980 --> 18:29.483
I'm so glad you've heard
the voice of reason.

18:29.566 --> 18:32.903
Yes, the will of the people
should not be subverted

18:32.986 --> 18:35.322
by demagogues who--
hey, what's this?

18:35.405 --> 18:37.825
"Springfield Colonial Village"?

18:40.536 --> 18:43.247
What the...?
You faked it!

18:43.330 --> 18:45.499
Lisa, how could you?

18:45.582 --> 18:47.417
It wasn't just her, Homie.

18:47.501 --> 18:48.418
It was all of us.

18:48.502 --> 18:50.587
I did it just to mess
with your mind.

18:50.671 --> 18:53.132
That's what a play
within a play is for!

18:53.215 --> 18:54.633
(choking)

18:54.716 --> 18:57.177
No strangling
on school days!

18:57.261 --> 19:00.347
Well, if there's one thing
I don't like being taught,

19:00.430 --> 19:01.598
it's a lesson!

19:01.682 --> 19:03.642
I'm so mad.

19:03.725 --> 19:05.644
Not only will I endorse
Ted Nugent,

19:05.727 --> 19:10.190
but I will call for an end
to the direct election of senators!

19:10.274 --> 19:11.692
Dad, no!

19:11.775 --> 19:12.860
Really?
That made sense?

19:12.943 --> 19:14.361
Then I'm definitely doing it.

19:16.947 --> 19:19.867
Folks, because I love
democracy so much,

19:19.950 --> 19:22.077
I command you
to vote for this man

19:22.161 --> 19:24.872
whom I alone have selected
as your next president.

19:24.955 --> 19:28.458
Now to baptize his candidacy
with my tears.

19:28.542 --> 19:32.796
The words "strutting stadium rocker"
are overused these days,

19:32.880 --> 19:36.133
but when I first
met Ted Nugent...

19:36.216 --> 19:37.176
(gasps)

19:37.259 --> 19:38.594
Uh, huh?

19:38.677 --> 19:40.262
My emotions were
so powerful.

19:40.345 --> 19:42.890
Come on, hurry up and cry
so I can get elected

19:42.973 --> 19:45.809
and open up the San Diego Zoo
for big game hunting.

19:45.893 --> 19:48.187
(grunting)

19:49.813 --> 19:51.523
It's not working. But why?

19:51.607 --> 19:52.900
Maybe because,
deep down,

19:52.983 --> 19:55.152
you know you don't believe
in what you're doing.

19:55.235 --> 19:56.904
Oh, my God, she's right.

19:56.987 --> 20:00.908
My lips will say anything,
but my eyes know the truth!

20:00.991 --> 20:03.285
My ears are
keeping their mouth shut.

20:05.537 --> 20:10.751
My fellow Americans,
I am full of crap.

20:10.834 --> 20:12.628
I knew you were, Dad.

20:12.711 --> 20:14.421
(sobbing)

20:14.504 --> 20:16.298
I always knew!

20:16.381 --> 20:18.091
(sobbing)

20:18.175 --> 20:22.221
Well, for one brief, glorious moment,
I was almost president,

20:22.304 --> 20:23.430
sort of, not really.

20:23.513 --> 20:26.350
Now, let me just play a sweet
song that I'll never hear.

20:26.433 --> 20:28.477
