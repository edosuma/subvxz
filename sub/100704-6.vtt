04:31.396 --> 04:33.147
Don't show the money.

04:33.231 --> 04:34.357
How much you want?

04:35.608 --> 04:36.818
I need another quarter.

04:49.998 --> 04:52.458
-All right, how many tries?
-I get three tries.

04:52.542 --> 04:55.169
Man, that's too far.
Two tries on that one, MJ.

04:56.170 --> 04:58.089
-Look at how far that is.
-Okay, Jerry Krause.

04:58.172 --> 04:59.674
Negotiate with somebody else.

06:16.793 --> 06:19.295
I'll give y'all four tries
to beat my one toss.

06:23.132 --> 06:24.884
Put your money up first.
Without seeing it.

06:48.533 --> 06:50.660
Watch this roll right into my pocket.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.957
Go protect the damn United Center.

07:13.975 --> 07:15.726
You guys know the boss man here?

07:15.810 --> 07:17.228
Yeah, we know him.

07:17.895 --> 07:19.313
We knew him well.

07:21.274 --> 07:24.110
We used to see him in the playoffs.
We don't know about this year.

08:41.854 --> 08:44.273
That's all we be thinking about
in the fourth quarter.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.234
-Icy beer.
-Cold beer.

08:48.653 --> 08:49.946
I don't know why y'all filming.

08:50.029 --> 08:52.281
We don't want y'all filming us
drinking no beer.

08:53.074 --> 08:55.034
I don't care what you film.

09:17.682 --> 09:19.308
Yo, Stan, can I borrow a cigarette?

09:23.062 --> 09:23.938
I gotta do the press.

09:32.822 --> 09:34.740
So you coming back next year, Michael?

16:29.321 --> 16:31.115
<i>Who was their biggest obstacle?</i>

21:39.006 --> 21:41.216
Why was the trip to Atlantic City
such a big deal?

26:12.737 --> 26:14.823
Get 'em off the floor, man.
It's one o'clock.

31:01.401 --> 31:03.570
I got a tee time at 3:30.

31:05.029 --> 31:07.073
Hey, Scottie, can I talk to you for a sec?

31:14.080 --> 31:16.124
He's healthy, he'll be playing tomorrow.

31:16.207 --> 31:18.126
He's got a tee time!

32:00.668 --> 32:02.629
You going to the swimming pool, guys?

32:02.712 --> 32:04.339
No, I'm going to Hooters.

32:14.515 --> 32:15.767
Come on, Ron Harper!

32:15.850 --> 32:17.602
Don't y'all go trying to run out of here!

32:17.685 --> 32:19.938
Come on, Ron. You taking all day.

32:20.021 --> 32:22.065
Throw the clubs up here
and come sit next to me.

32:42.043 --> 32:43.127
That's way past 'em.

32:44.587 --> 32:45.922
Right off their cart.

32:46.005 --> 32:48.257
I said, "Fore." They don't listen.

32:51.803 --> 32:52.929
Get your ass in there!

32:55.890 --> 32:57.433
-You hit that--
-Garbage!

32:58.267 --> 33:00.436
Shit, I can't get my drive together.

33:05.316 --> 33:07.026
I can't read the green.

33:14.325 --> 33:17.412
We broke even on a little side bet.
A hundred. 200.

33:18.037 --> 33:19.539
For what? That wasn't a do/don't one.

33:19.622 --> 33:21.666
-Shit!
-You said 100. You didn't say do/don't.

33:21.749 --> 33:23.668
I said par-birdie.
What do you think that is?

33:37.515 --> 33:40.351
That's good about Phil.
Phil knows we need a break.

33:44.856 --> 33:48.192
Young coaches,
it would probably be a practice day today.

33:49.736 --> 33:52.363
And you would have some mean guys.

36:18.467 --> 36:20.094
Handle the goddamn pressure!

38:38.316 --> 38:40.901
Michael is not beating us!

38:41.652 --> 38:46.532
Don't let him catch. Double him.
Make somebody else win the game.

40:24.505 --> 40:26.132
Don't take it personally, Charles!

41:27.568 --> 41:31.197
Charles, a final message to the people
of Chicago as you head back west now?

44:54.775 --> 44:56.026
Did you want to call your wife?
