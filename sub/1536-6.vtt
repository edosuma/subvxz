WEBVTT

00:00.960 --> 00:02.246
Previously
on Grimm...

00:02.320 --> 00:03.321
Had enough?

00:03.440 --> 00:04.440
What do you want
from me?

00:04.480 --> 00:06.289
To get our child back.

00:06.680 --> 00:08.170
Josh, where are you?
 On a bus.

00:08.320 --> 00:10.527
You need to find someplace
safe and stay there.

00:10.600 --> 00:11.601
Where the hell is that?

00:11.680 --> 00:14.684
Elizabeth recreated the
potion that Ada/ind used on Nick.

00:14.760 --> 00:16.364
And in order
to re-Grimm Nick,

00:16.440 --> 00:18.681
you have to breathe
in the potion and...

00:18.760 --> 00:19.760
And make love to you.

00:19.800 --> 00:20.801
As Adalind.

00:21.200 --> 00:22.201
Oh, God, no.

00:22.280 --> 00:23.281
A Wolfsangel.

00:23.440 --> 00:24.441
It's Wesen.

00:24.520 --> 00:25.521
Why?

00:25.640 --> 00:26.720
It's because
we got married.

00:27.120 --> 00:28.451
You need to be
a Grimm again.

00:36.480 --> 00:37.925
"There is no mercy in you.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.048
"You cut off the heads
of men and women

00:40.120 --> 00:42.168
"and these you wear as a
garland around your neck."

00:42.800 --> 00:43.801
No.

00:51.760 --> 00:53.330
I'm only going
to ask you this once.

00:55.120 --> 00:57.726
Do you mean what you just
said about me being a Grimm?

00:58.480 --> 00:59.686
Is that what you want?

01:03.040 --> 01:04.041
Yes.

01:04.239 --> 01:05.321
Then it's what
I want too.

01:13.440 --> 01:15.120
What do you wanna do?
Should we call it in?

01:15.800 --> 01:17.928
Not until we talk
to Monroe and Rosalee.

01:18.880 --> 01:20.484
I want to rip
their throats out!

01:20.520 --> 01:22.841
Monroe... They got a problem,
they can deal with me!

01:22.920 --> 01:24.410
Take me on!
But this!

01:25.640 --> 01:27.483
Cowards.
I mean, cowards!

01:30.160 --> 01:31.491
All right,
we can call this in...

01:31.560 --> 01:32.721
What good is that
gonna do?

01:33.120 --> 01:34.121
We can make arrests.

01:34.200 --> 01:35.247
That's not
gonna stop them!

01:35.320 --> 01:36.600
- Who is them?
- Most likely

01:36.640 --> 01:38.961
it's the Secundum
Naturae Ordinem Wesen.

01:39.040 --> 01:41.122
It's an ancient organization

01:41.200 --> 01:43.646
founded during the Middle
Ages, to keep Wesen pure.

01:43.720 --> 01:47.122
To them, intermarriage is a
crime against man and nature.

01:47.360 --> 01:49.124
This is all
because you got married?

01:49.200 --> 01:50.201
Yeah.

01:50.320 --> 01:51.890
And this isn't the first
time you've dealt with them.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.120
That cracked window in the Spice Shop?
It was a brick.

01:54.520 --> 01:56.170
It had a Wolfsangel on it.

01:56.560 --> 01:58.164
You should have told us.

01:58.240 --> 01:59.321
We didn't want
to worry you.

01:59.400 --> 02:00.526
You've got
your own problems.

02:00.640 --> 02:01.880
We didn't think it
would go this far.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.367
So, the Wolfsangel's
their burning cross?

02:04.440 --> 02:05.441
Yes.

02:05.600 --> 02:09.002
It was originally a wolf trap,
or in my ancestors case,

02:09.199 --> 02:10.565
a Blutbaden trap.

02:10.639 --> 02:13.120
It came to symbolize
control over all Wesen.

02:13.560 --> 02:14.891
Is the Wesen Council
involved?

02:15.040 --> 02:17.805
Officially, blood purity
organizations are outlawed,

02:17.880 --> 02:20.167
but there are those on the
Council who still believe

02:20.240 --> 02:21.890
intermarriage
is a sacrilege.

02:21.960 --> 02:23.120
Well you need
to stay with us.

02:23.240 --> 02:26.403
Oh no. They are not
driving us from our home.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.960
Well, assuming this isn't gonna
be a standard police procedure,

02:29.320 --> 02:30.321
how do we find them?

02:30.400 --> 02:31.401
I don't know.

02:32.200 --> 02:33.201
They're all Wesen.

02:33.320 --> 02:34.321
That's all I know.

02:34.400 --> 02:36.323
So it's not really
your problem anymore.

02:38.760 --> 02:39.761
Well, it's going to be.

02:41.080 --> 02:42.081
What does that mean?

02:43.840 --> 02:45.365
Nick is gonna sleep
with Adalind.

02:45.920 --> 02:46.921
What?

02:47.080 --> 02:48.081
Really?

02:48.240 --> 02:49.571
You're going to take
the potion?

02:51.440 --> 02:52.851
Are you sure
you're up to this?

02:55.480 --> 02:56.481
We're sure.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.001
And ready.

02:58.440 --> 02:59.601
And the sooner
the better.

03:13.680 --> 03:15.967
Two hours and
twenty-seven minutes to go.

03:16.520 --> 03:18.284
You want me to drive?
I'm good.

03:18.600 --> 03:20.443
Coffee?
I could use a little.

03:41.280 --> 03:42.964
Idiot's got his brights on.

03:47.080 --> 03:48.081
Let him pass.

03:59.040 --> 04:00.405
So much
for the scenic route.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.680
We should've just left
in the morning.

04:04.080 --> 04:05.445
You're all
the scenery I need.

04:08.360 --> 04:09.441
Oh, my God.

04:10.680 --> 04:11.681
Oh, my God!

04:12.720 --> 04:13.721
Hang on!

04:23.240 --> 04:24.241
Oh, my God.

04:26.520 --> 04:27.521
Suleka...

04:30.800 --> 04:31.800
Suleka.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.081
Door won't open.

04:36.960 --> 04:38.610
My legs are stuck.

04:40.240 --> 04:41.241
Suleka...

04:41.680 --> 04:43.125
I can't get out.

04:50.240 --> 04:51.287
No!

04:54.360 --> 04:55.771
No, no, no.

04:57.400 --> 04:59.607
She's stuck.
I can't get her out.

05:00.720 --> 05:01.801
We'll have to get another.

05:03.560 --> 05:05.801
No.

05:06.240 --> 05:07.480
No! No!

05:08.400 --> 05:09.401
No!

05:10.800 --> 05:11.801
No.

05:27.960 --> 05:29.325
AUSTRIA

05:30.400 --> 05:32.926
If this information is
accurate, and I believe it is,

05:33.000 --> 05:34.040
we'll need
to move quickly.

05:34.080 --> 05:35.411
You're certain
it's Meisner.

05:35.640 --> 05:36.641
No.

05:36.720 --> 05:38.802
Worth the risk? Yes.

05:42.200 --> 05:44.806
Well, don't you look
fantastic.

05:45.040 --> 05:46.041
How do you feel?

05:46.600 --> 05:47.601
Hungry.

05:48.320 --> 05:49.321
Then you should eat.

05:50.160 --> 05:52.686
The last time I was offered food,
it didn't turn out so well.

05:54.600 --> 05:55.601
Not to worry.

05:57.120 --> 05:58.121
It's all organic.

06:01.120 --> 06:02.610
This looks so damn good.

06:02.720 --> 06:05.041
You know, I know the Resistance
helped you to get out,

06:05.120 --> 06:08.408
and that Herr Meisner was
instrumental in the orchestration.

06:08.520 --> 06:09.521
Uh-huh.

06:09.600 --> 06:11.648
So, how did he know our
people were waiting for you?

06:12.360 --> 06:13.407
He didn't.

06:13.960 --> 06:15.246
He killed six Verrat.

06:15.640 --> 06:16.641
Not all six.

06:17.040 --> 06:18.041
No?

06:18.840 --> 06:20.080
How many did you kill?

06:21.080 --> 06:22.366
I didn't kill anyone.

06:23.480 --> 06:24.641
Well they didn't kill
themselves. I hope.

06:24.720 --> 06:25.801
No.

06:25.960 --> 06:26.961
There was a woman.

06:27.320 --> 06:28.321
She killed them.

06:28.520 --> 06:30.761
She was already there,
working for the Resistance.

06:31.160 --> 06:32.525
She must be quite a woman.

06:32.640 --> 06:34.563
Oh, she is.

06:35.160 --> 06:38.846
So it was a bit of a mistake,
you deciding to go to Portland.

06:40.120 --> 06:41.167
Rather obvious.

06:41.480 --> 06:43.448
I didn't choose Portland,
Kelly did.

06:43.520 --> 06:44.521
Kelly?

06:44.640 --> 06:46.324
The woman, Nick's mother.

06:47.640 --> 06:48.721
Nick Burkhardt's mother?

06:49.040 --> 06:50.166
You didn't know that either?

06:51.160 --> 06:54.369
I didn't know who she was or where
we were going until we got there

06:54.800 --> 06:56.404
and she took me
to Nick's house.

06:56.680 --> 06:58.967
The Resistance was supposed
to deliver you to Brazil.

06:59.160 --> 07:00.889
I think Nick's mother
figured that one out.

07:00.960 --> 07:02.325
Do you suppose
this was the woman

07:02.440 --> 07:05.364
who was with Burkhardt and Sean
Renard at Weston Steward's house?

07:05.480 --> 07:06.606
Who's Weston Steward?

07:07.600 --> 07:08.761
No matter, he's dead.

07:09.320 --> 07:10.320
But I'm curious,

07:10.360 --> 07:13.603
how did Renard convince you to give
your child to me in the first place?

07:13.840 --> 07:15.126
He brought me
to the police station

07:15.200 --> 07:16.565
to talk about
my mother's murder.

07:16.640 --> 07:19.849
Which I found out
was committed by Nick's mom.

07:20.240 --> 07:21.480
That must have been awkward.

07:21.960 --> 07:22.961
A little.

07:23.440 --> 07:26.284
And then he took the baby
and said he gave her to you.

07:26.360 --> 07:29.011
So, now I'm curious.

07:29.920 --> 07:31.126
How did you lose her?

07:31.360 --> 07:33.362
The Resistance was waiting
for us at the airport.

07:33.720 --> 07:36.451
Except the Resistance had no idea
they were going to Portland.

07:37.560 --> 07:38.971
That was
Kelly Burkhardt's idea.

07:39.040 --> 07:40.883
Kelly Burkhardt
seems to be everywhere.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.883
She said something to me
at the police station.

07:43.560 --> 07:46.404
I had to give up my son
because of who I was.

07:46.720 --> 07:49.530
If I hadn't done that,
he might have been killed.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.443
That's your problem,
not mine.

07:51.760 --> 07:52.807
If you're looking
for some sort

07:52.880 --> 07:54.245
of forgiveness,
I don't have any.

07:54.400 --> 07:56.050
I'm not asking
for forgiveness,

07:56.880 --> 07:58.723
I want you to understand.

08:00.560 --> 08:04.610
Sometimes we have to
sacrifice what we love most.

08:08.080 --> 08:09.525
Perhaps you'd like
to share that.

08:10.120 --> 08:12.851
"Sometimes we have to
sacrifice what we love most."

08:13.800 --> 08:14.881
That's what she said.

08:18.600 --> 08:21.080
I do believe we now know
who has the child.

08:23.760 --> 08:25.205
Ferula Tingitana.

08:31.160 --> 08:32.684
One drop less than last time.

08:37.960 --> 08:39.006
Time for the hat.

08:39.960 --> 08:40.961
I got it.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.126
Now it's up to you.

08:59.520 --> 09:01.170
Take three deep breaths.
No more.

09:01.240 --> 09:02.890
Unless you want it
to be permanent.

09:02.960 --> 09:04.121
No!
Nothing.

09:06.240 --> 09:07.605
How long will I have
to be her?

09:08.000 --> 09:09.650
Not long.
So don't waste your time.

09:09.800 --> 09:10.801
And when they're done,

09:11.440 --> 09:12.771
Nick will be
a Grimm again?

09:13.320 --> 09:15.641
If it works,
it will work in its own time.

09:15.920 --> 09:16.921
If it works?

09:17.960 --> 09:19.485
There are a lot of unknowns.

09:19.840 --> 09:20.966
The same if you do nothing.

09:22.080 --> 09:23.240
Let's just get this
over with.

09:33.840 --> 09:34.841
You Okay?

09:37.400 --> 09:38.401
How do I look?

09:38.760 --> 09:39.761
Like you.

09:40.960 --> 09:42.200
Maybe I didn't get
enough of it?

09:42.440 --> 09:43.441
Look at your hand.

09:48.320 --> 09:49.321
Oh, my god...

09:56.800 --> 09:58.006
Wow.

09:58.520 --> 09:59.521
Yeah, that's her.

09:59.840 --> 10:01.604
It worked?
Big time.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.010
Oh, that's really weird.

10:05.200 --> 10:06.201
How do you feel?

10:07.040 --> 10:08.040
Like me?

10:08.080 --> 10:09.280
Which me are you
talking about?

10:09.440 --> 10:11.044
Me. Juliette.

10:11.200 --> 10:12.201
Enough talking.

10:12.720 --> 10:13.721
It's time to leave.

10:17.080 --> 10:18.280
Trubel.

10:18.360 --> 10:19.805
Yeah, I'm...
I'm going with you.

10:23.160 --> 10:24.161
This...

10:24.720 --> 10:25.846
This is so...

10:26.960 --> 10:28.291
I don't even know
what to call it.

10:28.880 --> 10:30.291
At least it's me
this time.

10:49.320 --> 10:50.924
Yeah, that'll help.
I hope.

10:57.120 --> 10:58.804
Or maybe if I just
close my eyes.

10:58.880 --> 11:01.247
No, we're not doing it
that way.

11:02.520 --> 11:03.521
Really?

11:04.600 --> 11:05.601
You love me, Nick.

11:07.240 --> 11:08.651
What you see isn't me,

11:09.280 --> 11:10.281
but you know it is.

11:11.600 --> 11:12.761
Yeah, that helps.

11:13.360 --> 11:14.930
This is your one
and only chance

11:15.000 --> 11:16.684
to have an affair
with my blessing.

11:18.160 --> 11:19.446
You may as well enjoy it,

11:20.040 --> 11:21.201
because it's still me

11:22.520 --> 11:23.885
and I can only see you

11:24.760 --> 11:26.000
and I'm going
to have at it.

11:28.880 --> 11:30.291
Well, if you put it
that way.

11:36.600 --> 11:39.331
I can't imagine how difficult
this must be for them.

11:39.960 --> 11:41.086
I think the word
is creepy.

11:41.160 --> 11:42.286
I really hope it works.

11:42.360 --> 11:44.806
It's been kind of strange, you know,
him having to ask me for help

11:44.880 --> 11:46.609
when he was the one that
taught me what a Grimm was.

11:46.680 --> 11:48.364
I'm sure it's pretty
awkward for him, too,

11:48.440 --> 11:50.090
you know,
sort of like the professor

11:50.160 --> 11:52.242
asking the student
to explain what he taught.

11:52.320 --> 11:53.481
You should
stay here tonight.

11:54.120 --> 11:55.167
We have a guest room.

11:55.280 --> 11:57.362
Nick will call us, right?
If things start to happen.

11:57.440 --> 11:58.440
He'll call.

11:58.480 --> 12:00.050
I'm sure they'll tell us
when they're ready.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.485
We should just get
some sleep.

12:05.560 --> 12:07.324
All right, yeah, sleep.

12:07.400 --> 12:09.164
'Cause I gotta stop thinking
about Nick and Juliette

12:09.240 --> 12:11.049
or Nick and Adalind
or Adalind with Juliette.

12:11.120 --> 12:14.249
I mean, the whole thing is like some
bizarre, convoluted ménage a trois.

12:14.320 --> 12:15.606
Monroe, we have a guest.
Oh.

12:17.480 --> 12:18.527
Sorry, Trubel.

12:18.680 --> 12:20.330
Oh, I know
what convoluted means.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.331
You feel any different?

12:37.680 --> 12:38.727
Not really.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.650
So...

12:45.400 --> 12:46.401
How was it?

12:48.800 --> 12:50.245
Are you really
going to ask me that?

12:50.360 --> 12:52.840
Well, I'm sort of
interested.

12:54.320 --> 12:55.651
If I say it was good,

12:56.440 --> 12:57.566
you'll never forget it.

12:58.040 --> 13:00.247
If I say it was bad,
you'll never forget it.

13:00.960 --> 13:02.644
This is a no-win situation.

13:03.240 --> 13:06.210
Well, just so you know,
it was good for both of us.

13:12.800 --> 13:14.131
Which one of you
said that?

13:15.200 --> 13:16.201
Me.

13:17.800 --> 13:19.086
This isn't even funny.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.726
It's so strange,

13:24.360 --> 13:25.725
I really hate you.

13:27.680 --> 13:31.366
I am going to get
all of us a drink.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.728
Talk about getting
under someone's skin.

13:46.440 --> 13:47.441
Juliette?

13:48.440 --> 13:49.441
Are you okay?

13:58.760 --> 13:59.761
Juliette?

14:01.760 --> 14:04.001
Oh, my God,
I'm gonna call 911.

14:04.080 --> 14:06.128
No. It... I'm... I'm okay.

14:06.360 --> 14:07.361
No, don't move.

14:07.800 --> 14:09.609
Whatever it was,
it's gone now.

14:11.440 --> 14:12.441
Okay.

14:15.160 --> 14:16.321
You should lie down.

14:16.440 --> 14:18.568
I'm fine,
the pain is...

14:19.120 --> 14:20.610
Oh, God,
coming back again!

14:36.640 --> 14:37.971
Oh, my God,
that really hurt.

14:38.120 --> 14:39.121
But you're back.

14:41.120 --> 14:42.120
What?

14:42.160 --> 14:43.366
You're you again.

14:44.480 --> 14:45.527
Thank God.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.766
Let me just say,
that woman is such a bitch.

14:57.040 --> 14:58.121
How you feeling?

14:59.520 --> 15:02.967
These rude épreuves take more and
more out of you the older you get.

15:03.120 --> 15:04.690
Well, you still look
very beautiful.

15:07.080 --> 15:08.081
Not without effort.

15:10.240 --> 15:12.242
I underestimated its power.

15:16.200 --> 15:17.690
I can feel it
in the cloth.

15:18.160 --> 15:21.004
I believe it's French. It's quite old.
The fabric's exquisite.

15:21.240 --> 15:23.208
This could be one of
the original trente-sept.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.764
From the Malleus Maleficarum?

15:27.280 --> 15:28.566
Hammer of the Witches.

15:28.640 --> 15:30.483
A brutal time
for our ancestors.

15:31.200 --> 15:33.009
How do you think
Adalind acquired this?

15:34.360 --> 15:36.362
From her mother
after she died.

15:37.160 --> 15:38.880
Yes, but where do you think
she got it from?

15:41.040 --> 15:42.405
Treat it with proper respect.

15:42.680 --> 15:43.886
It could come in handy.

15:44.800 --> 15:48.122
Which is why
I'm leaving it with you.

15:51.320 --> 15:52.321
When are you going?

15:54.040 --> 15:55.041
I'm not certain.

15:55.480 --> 15:58.609
But I think it's
best we say goodbye now.

16:02.560 --> 16:04.403
You know I'm not very good
at these things.

16:08.160 --> 16:09.161
I will miss you.

16:09.400 --> 16:10.401
And I, you.

16:12.080 --> 16:13.320
Please be careful.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.890
You know what I did for you can
only be done once, for both of us.

16:23.840 --> 16:25.046
I want my granddaughter.

16:26.960 --> 16:28.564
If I could give her
to you, I would.

16:30.040 --> 16:31.041
But I believe Nick
when he says

16:31.120 --> 16:32.849
he has no idea
where his mother is.

16:32.920 --> 16:35.287
Well, it's his mother. She'll
be in contact at some point.

16:36.080 --> 16:37.445
I need you to be
ready for that.

16:39.720 --> 16:40.721
I promise you,

16:41.280 --> 16:42.361
I will.

16:48.920 --> 16:50.763
What?

16:50.920 --> 16:52.729
I'm just so glad
to have you back.

16:52.800 --> 16:53.801
Mmm.

16:54.600 --> 16:56.523
Well, the question is,

16:57.160 --> 16:58.321
do we have you back?

16:59.280 --> 17:00.281
I have no idea.

17:00.920 --> 17:02.524
And I'm not gonna find out
by hanging out with you.

17:02.600 --> 17:06.207
Well, then I guess you have to
go out and find some Wesen butt,

17:06.520 --> 17:07.521
and kick it.

17:15.119 --> 17:16.121
I got it.

17:23.119 --> 17:24.121
You lose your key?

17:24.200 --> 17:26.680
No, I... I just
didn't want to come in if,

17:27.440 --> 17:28.487
you know, you two were...

17:29.840 --> 17:30.887
We're done.

17:32.200 --> 17:33.201
Done, done?

17:33.320 --> 17:35.482
Like, I mean,
Adalind, done?

17:35.640 --> 17:36.687
Adalind's gone.

17:37.040 --> 17:38.041
Juliette's back.

17:38.640 --> 17:39.641
We're good!

17:41.520 --> 17:43.727
Hi. Just wanted to be sure.
Good.

17:49.320 --> 17:51.368
Oh, I'm so relieved
it's you.

17:52.520 --> 17:56.809
I'm so sorry, we really should have
called to tell you it was finito.

17:56.880 --> 17:58.882
No, don't worry about it, we
didn't give it a second thought.

17:58.960 --> 17:59.961
We went right to bed.

18:02.280 --> 18:03.884
Did it work?
I don't know.

18:03.960 --> 18:05.246
Maybe we should find out.

18:09.080 --> 18:10.081
Not happening.

18:10.600 --> 18:12.762
I haven't woged yet.

18:13.320 --> 18:14.367
Oh.

18:18.640 --> 18:19.687
Anytime you're ready.

18:24.320 --> 18:26.209
Oh. I...

18:26.800 --> 18:27.961
Guess that answers
that question.

18:28.040 --> 18:29.087
You know what,
I shouldn't have pushed it.

18:29.160 --> 18:30.207
Maybe it's too soon.

18:30.280 --> 18:31.406
Elizabeth said
it could take some time.

18:33.600 --> 18:34.601
Hank.

18:35.200 --> 18:36.361
Nope. Nothing yet.

18:41.040 --> 18:42.087
I can meet you
in twenty.

18:43.400 --> 18:44.401
Gotta go.

18:47.960 --> 18:48.961
Are you okay?

18:49.240 --> 18:50.241
I'm fine.

18:53.640 --> 18:55.404
I'm really happy you're you.

18:56.920 --> 18:57.921
Me too.

18:58.960 --> 19:00.040
'Cause let me
just tell you,

19:00.520 --> 19:01.806
I did not like
being a blonde.

19:04.720 --> 19:06.768
Car looks to have gone off
the road late last night.

19:06.840 --> 19:08.729
Discovered this morning
by a bicyclist.

19:08.800 --> 19:10.768
- We know who it is?
- Suleka Turner.

19:10.840 --> 19:13.411
Portland address. Car's registered
to her husband Dix Turner.

19:13.480 --> 19:15.960
First responders got here
about an hour ago.

19:16.400 --> 19:18.129
She said something
came out of the woods,

19:18.200 --> 19:19.850
took her husband,
and dragged him away.

19:21.200 --> 19:22.850
We're searching for the
husband but no sign of him.

19:22.920 --> 19:25.207
His seat belt's been cut
and there is blood so...

19:25.280 --> 19:27.408
She's pretty out of it, but
she's trying to say something.

19:27.520 --> 19:28.931
You might want to listen
before we sedate her.

19:29.040 --> 19:30.040
All right.

19:34.760 --> 19:37.809
Ma'am, we're detectives and we're
trying to find out what happened.

19:38.440 --> 19:40.807
They tried to take
me, they took my husband.

19:40.920 --> 19:41.921
Who?

19:42.080 --> 19:44.970
They were terrible, I've
never seen anything like them.

19:45.440 --> 19:49.206
He said they have to get another,
because they couldn't get me.

19:49.920 --> 19:51.000
We've got to take her.

19:54.680 --> 19:56.523
County Sheriff got here
before we did.

19:56.600 --> 19:57.601
They secured the area.

19:57.680 --> 19:59.887
And made the determination there
was a possible kidnapping,

19:59.960 --> 20:01.803
which is the reason
you're here.

20:01.960 --> 20:06.761
Well, they definitely hit
something, this tire is shredded.

20:07.800 --> 20:08.801
Ah!

20:09.280 --> 20:10.406
Think I found something.

20:14.800 --> 20:16.760
Yeah, I'd say they hit something.
What'd you find?

20:16.960 --> 20:19.531
Detectives Burkhardt and
Griffin, Deputy Sheriff Farris.

20:19.920 --> 20:20.921
Good to meet you.

20:21.120 --> 20:22.121
You too.

20:22.600 --> 20:25.120
Well, looks like they hit a piece
of wood with some nails in it.

20:25.200 --> 20:27.160
I've seen something like
this on this road before.

20:27.200 --> 20:29.123
When?
About five, six years ago,

20:29.200 --> 20:30.326
one of my first cases.

20:30.400 --> 20:32.209
Maybe fifteen miles east.

20:32.280 --> 20:35.363
Same deal, wrecked car,
two missing people.

20:35.680 --> 20:38.081
A spiked strip just
like that in the tire.

20:38.240 --> 20:39.440
Oh, yeah,
I remember that case.

20:39.920 --> 20:40.921
Nobody was ever found.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.240
We need to take another
look at that evidence.

20:42.320 --> 20:43.651
Better get some dogs
out here.

20:44.520 --> 20:46.284
Uh, guys,
we're not done over here.

20:46.360 --> 20:47.400
I'll tell them
to hold off.

20:47.440 --> 20:48.441
Thank you.

20:50.320 --> 20:51.526
Let's get
that tire off.

20:51.840 --> 20:54.200
Hey guys, we're not done
with the investigation yet.

21:15.720 --> 21:16.721
She's on the move.

21:22.440 --> 21:23.441
You watching me?

21:23.680 --> 21:25.125
Just waiting for a friend.

21:25.840 --> 21:26.887
You gonna follow me?

21:27.440 --> 21:28.960
I don't know what
you're talking about.

21:29.080 --> 21:31.447
Call your boss Chavez, tell
her you can't follow me.

21:55.160 --> 21:56.240
What the hell
are you doing?

21:57.280 --> 21:58.720
Don't know
what you're talking about.

22:13.040 --> 22:15.168
November 27th,
six years ago.

22:15.360 --> 22:16.360
Homemade.

22:16.400 --> 22:17.600
Look familiar?

22:18.920 --> 22:21.810
The victims were Keith and Jennifer
Blakely of Spokane, Washington.

22:22.920 --> 22:24.729
Reported missing
at the scene,

22:25.600 --> 22:26.931
bodies never found.

22:27.480 --> 22:28.845
Looks like there
was a survivor.

22:29.280 --> 22:30.281
Penny Conner,

22:30.920 --> 22:31.920
Jennifer's sister.

22:31.960 --> 22:34.247
She was 13 years old.

22:34.640 --> 22:36.563
Asleep in the back seat,
wasn't wearing a seat belt,

22:36.640 --> 22:38.404
got knocked to the floor
during the accident.

22:39.280 --> 22:40.281
You really know this.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.291
I remember
what she said to me,

22:43.720 --> 22:46.087
monsters took her sister
and brother-in-law.

22:47.440 --> 22:49.360
Well, you wouldn't have
known that six years ago.

22:51.640 --> 22:54.723
Get off. I told you,
man, I didn't hit her.

22:55.200 --> 22:56.611
Come on,
settle down!

23:04.800 --> 23:05.801
You okay?

23:06.480 --> 23:07.606
Yeah, I thought I, uh...

23:10.520 --> 23:11.521
Never mind.

23:11.880 --> 23:13.450
Heard from
the dog handlers.

23:14.320 --> 23:16.402
They picked up a trail, but it
dead-ended back at the highway.

23:16.480 --> 23:19.484
So, there was probably
a car waiting for them.

23:19.560 --> 23:21.642
This was buried where the
car went off the road.

23:22.120 --> 23:23.201
Search dog dug it up.

23:27.520 --> 23:28.521
What the hell is this?

23:29.560 --> 23:31.449
Stuff nightmares
are made of.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.001
Or bad art.

23:35.160 --> 23:36.286
If these crimes
are connected,

23:36.360 --> 23:38.931
there may be another one of those
where we were this morning.

23:54.840 --> 23:55.921
Was she in a car?

23:56.520 --> 23:57.567
A bike?

23:57.640 --> 23:59.290
Yeah a bike,
yeah, the kind you pedal.

24:10.120 --> 24:11.360
Oh, my God!
Josh?

24:11.440 --> 24:12.441
Trubel?
Get...

24:16.120 --> 24:17.121
No, no, no!
Stay down!

24:17.200 --> 24:18.565
I didn't do anything.
I know.

24:18.640 --> 24:19.766
Then why are you doing
this to me?

24:19.840 --> 24:20.841
Stay down.

24:22.760 --> 24:23.840
What's going on?

24:23.880 --> 24:25.530
A lot.

24:27.440 --> 24:28.487
What are you doing here?

24:30.120 --> 24:31.610
I had no place else to go.

24:36.880 --> 24:39.167
You know my Uncle Andre
had one of these things.

24:39.680 --> 24:43.048
Spent hours and hours
going up and down beaches.

24:43.880 --> 24:46.963
One time he found
a watch worth $5,000.

24:47.240 --> 24:48.366
Wow, that's pretty good.

24:49.440 --> 24:50.726
He lost it the week before.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.286
You can't make
this stuff up.

24:56.440 --> 24:57.441
Found something.

25:08.800 --> 25:09.801
Another beer can.

25:09.880 --> 25:10.880
Popular spot.

25:10.920 --> 25:12.160
Hey, working on a six pack.

25:25.440 --> 25:26.646
Not a beer can.

25:26.760 --> 25:28.728
Yeah. Looks like
we got a connection.

25:29.040 --> 25:31.327
Hey. They said I could
find you guys here.

25:31.800 --> 25:32.847
You got something?

25:34.600 --> 25:35.601
It's kinda weird.

25:35.880 --> 25:36.881
Is it important?

25:36.960 --> 25:38.962
Just like another one
I found six years ago.

25:39.320 --> 25:40.321
What is it?

25:40.400 --> 25:41.401
Some kind of totem?

25:41.560 --> 25:42.561
Could be a signature.

25:43.040 --> 25:45.361
I did some looking into related
accidents on this highway.

25:45.480 --> 25:46.641
Went back 10 years.

25:46.880 --> 25:48.723
The first was your case,
six years ago.

25:48.880 --> 25:52.123
Another case with similar
circumstances three years after that.

25:52.200 --> 25:54.646
Young couple,
last seen on Route 406.

25:54.760 --> 25:55.886
They were going camping.
Their SUV

25:55.960 --> 25:57.246
was found abandoned
near a trail head

25:57.320 --> 26:00.005
so everybody assumed
they got lost in the woods.

26:00.120 --> 26:02.691
Campers get lost all the
time, what's the similarity?

26:03.160 --> 26:04.446
Left their camping
gear behind.

26:04.720 --> 26:05.801
Where was the SUV found?

26:05.880 --> 26:07.200
About four miles
down the highway.

26:07.600 --> 26:10.080
That's why I came, I thought you
guys might wanna check it out.

26:23.360 --> 26:24.361
I can dig.

26:27.040 --> 26:28.201
All yours.

26:34.920 --> 26:36.285
Nothing here.

26:37.320 --> 26:38.401
Wait.

26:41.240 --> 26:42.526
Thought I heard something.

26:44.600 --> 26:46.682
Just, uh, keep digging
where you were digging.

26:46.800 --> 26:47.801
Okay.

27:08.080 --> 27:10.811
Anybody know any
artist/welders around here?

27:10.920 --> 27:13.207
Couple of junk yards,
they might know.

27:14.040 --> 27:15.041
I'll look into it.

27:16.400 --> 27:17.481
All right, thanks.

27:18.400 --> 27:20.721
"June third,
1893, Calcutta...

27:21.720 --> 27:25.884
"After six weeks in the foul
Bustee, I encountered my first.

27:26.040 --> 27:27.087
"It attacked.

27:27.280 --> 27:29.806
"Fortunately I had my dagger and
was able to slit its throat

27:29.880 --> 27:32.611
"before it was able to tighten
its tongue around mine."

27:33.120 --> 27:34.565
That's one hell
of a tongue.

27:34.960 --> 27:36.530
"Upon close examination,

27:36.600 --> 27:38.648
"I have concluded
that the Phansigar

27:38.760 --> 27:40.762
"is a particular type
of Skalengeck

27:41.240 --> 27:44.449
"not dissimilar to the visage
of the Komodo dragon."

27:44.920 --> 27:46.843
That's what it's called,
a Phansigar?

27:46.920 --> 27:48.206
Yeah, there's more.

27:48.440 --> 27:52.161
"Here in India the Phansigars
hide among the Thuggees,

27:52.240 --> 27:54.242
"the dreaded
Hindu cult of thieves

27:54.360 --> 27:57.489
"that strangle travelers
as a sacrifice to Kali.

27:58.320 --> 28:00.129
"But I have discovered
that the Phansigars

28:00.240 --> 28:02.607
"have their own brand
of human sacrifice.

28:02.920 --> 28:07.130
"Using their filthy tongues, they
choke their victims into silence.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.570
"These unfortunate souls,

28:10.680 --> 28:13.570
"always a young couple,
are then buried alive.

28:14.960 --> 28:17.088
"This evil practice
must be performed

28:17.200 --> 28:19.441
"every three years
to placate Kali."

28:22.720 --> 28:24.165
Guess who signed this one?

28:24.320 --> 28:25.321
Who?

28:25.520 --> 28:26.851
Rudyard Kipling.

28:27.520 --> 28:28.681
Rudyard Kipling.

28:28.800 --> 28:31.041
Jungle Book, Rudyard Kipling?
He was a Grimm?

28:31.560 --> 28:33.881
Apparently his sword
was as mighty as his pen.

28:33.960 --> 28:34.961
Mmm.

28:36.400 --> 28:38.971
Every three years, fits the
time line of the kidnappings.

28:39.120 --> 28:41.240
Only this time, they
only got their male victim,

28:41.760 --> 28:42.761
Dix Turner.

28:43.400 --> 28:45.880
That means they still need a woman
to complete their sacrifice.

28:47.120 --> 28:49.600
We found one of those buried
at each accident sight.

28:51.320 --> 28:52.321
So it's Wesen.

28:52.400 --> 28:53.920
Didn't know that
the first time around.

28:54.200 --> 28:55.201
What about now?

28:55.680 --> 28:56.920
I'm not sure
it's coming back.

28:57.920 --> 28:59.120
You're going to need
some help.

29:01.200 --> 29:02.201
Yeah.

29:02.520 --> 29:05.330
Got the preliminary lab report
on those little guys...

29:05.520 --> 29:08.171
They traced paint on the metal.
It's all automobile paint.

29:08.280 --> 29:09.486
Scrap from a salvage yard?

29:09.680 --> 29:12.001
There's one out on that highway,
been there for 35 years.

29:12.080 --> 29:15.243
But it was bought out seven
years ago by JP and Sons.

29:15.320 --> 29:17.209
Around the same time
the disappearances started.

29:17.520 --> 29:19.204
Address, anyone?

29:26.240 --> 29:27.400
What's going on?

29:32.640 --> 29:33.687
What are you doing?

29:55.360 --> 29:56.361
They're leaving.

30:03.160 --> 30:04.400
Mmm.

30:05.640 --> 30:07.722
Sorry, I haven't eaten
since yesterday.

30:08.360 --> 30:09.361
I know what that's like.

30:11.200 --> 30:12.850
How long they been watching you?
Mmm.

30:13.400 --> 30:14.401
Not really sure.

30:14.680 --> 30:15.681
What about you?

30:15.800 --> 30:17.086
My life's a complete wreck.

30:17.720 --> 30:20.121
Soon as I got home, there
were men in my dad's house,

30:20.200 --> 30:21.440
they ripped the place apart.

30:22.680 --> 30:23.727
I barely got out.

30:24.080 --> 30:25.760
You think it's 'cause
your dad was a Grimm?

30:27.400 --> 30:29.084
What do you think?

30:29.560 --> 30:31.210
Sorry, dumb question.

30:32.320 --> 30:33.481
Probably Hundjagers.

30:33.680 --> 30:34.681
How would I know?

30:36.160 --> 30:37.366
I gotta talk to Nick.

30:37.760 --> 30:38.966
He's the only one
who can help me.

30:39.080 --> 30:40.730
Oh, you don't know,
do you?

30:41.360 --> 30:43.681
I mean you wouldn't,
how could you?

30:43.920 --> 30:44.921
Could I what?

30:48.080 --> 30:49.081
What?

30:51.200 --> 30:53.965
He's not dead, is he, 'cause I
just talked to him on the phone.

30:54.480 --> 30:55.920
He's the one
that told me to get out.

30:56.120 --> 30:59.329
I mean, I left my job,
I left my car, everything!

30:59.400 --> 31:00.447
He's okay, but...

31:02.040 --> 31:04.407
...things are a little
different now.

31:07.680 --> 31:08.727
"Different now"?

31:11.040 --> 31:12.041
Okay,

31:13.000 --> 31:14.490
what does
"different now" mean?

31:20.440 --> 31:21.771
Thank you. Come again.

31:24.920 --> 31:25.921
Thank you.

31:27.480 --> 31:29.403
Okay,
so what's the problem?

31:29.480 --> 31:30.481
Phansigars.

31:31.080 --> 31:32.605
I... Never heard of 'em.

31:32.680 --> 31:34.170
They're into
human sacrifice.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.923
That I've heard of.
I need you to come with me.

31:37.440 --> 31:38.441
Dude, L“

31:38.560 --> 31:41.211
I can't leave Rosalee alone,
not with what's going on.

31:41.280 --> 31:42.280
I know.

31:42.320 --> 31:43.560
I hope you're not bringing
a Phansigar here,

31:43.640 --> 31:44.926
because I have heard
of them.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.809
Well, I wish what Juliette and
I had gone through had worked,

31:46.880 --> 31:48.644
'cause if I had another
way to do this, I would.

31:48.760 --> 31:49.886
Nick, it could still work.

31:50.440 --> 31:52.329
Yeah, well, it's taking
its own damn time.

31:55.160 --> 31:57.049
Sorry I'm late. I had
to pick up more ammo.

31:58.240 --> 32:00.561
I'm sorry,
you brought your gun?

32:00.640 --> 32:01.641
Yeah.

32:03.640 --> 32:04.801
Hey. Hey.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.286
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

32:11.360 --> 32:12.850
- Hey.
- Hey.

32:14.920 --> 32:16.001
You're good to go.

32:36.760 --> 32:38.364
Can I help you?
Deputy Farris.

32:38.480 --> 32:40.084
I'm following up from the
accident this morning.

32:40.160 --> 32:41.161
You towed the wreck.

32:41.360 --> 32:43.601
Oh, yes, uh, from the
police impound lot.

32:43.760 --> 32:45.649
I know. But I'm, uh,
looking for someone

32:45.720 --> 32:48.405
who's buying small quantities
of scrap metal like this.

32:48.480 --> 32:51.290
Oh, you mean like, uh,
artists or something?

32:51.360 --> 32:52.521
Could you put together
a list?

32:52.680 --> 32:54.125
I don't know,
it's possible.

32:54.240 --> 32:56.481
See, I don't ask the customers
what they use it for.

32:56.880 --> 32:58.723
It would be someone
who's been here

32:58.800 --> 33:00.325
more than once
in the last few years.

33:00.440 --> 33:01.646
I can't remember.

33:01.720 --> 33:02.881
You think you could check?
Oh, of course.

33:04.080 --> 33:05.127
Oh, excuse me.
Sure.

33:07.680 --> 33:08.966
- Deputy Farris.
- Hey.

33:09.120 --> 33:10.121
What'd you find out?

33:10.240 --> 33:12.641
JP and Sons was bought out
seven years ago,

33:12.760 --> 33:14.569
just before
the disappearances began.

33:14.960 --> 33:17.600
Well I'm at the yard now. They are
cutting up a lot of scrap metal.

33:17.800 --> 33:18.881
I'm trying to get
a list of buyers.

33:18.960 --> 33:21.201
All right, be careful, we'll
be there as soon as we can.

33:21.280 --> 33:22.281
I'll be here.

33:28.160 --> 33:29.400
What have you done?

33:29.600 --> 33:30.960
We needed a woman.
Now we have one.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.525
She's perfect.
You idiot.

33:32.600 --> 33:34.329
Can't you see
she's a police officer?

33:34.880 --> 33:37.087
We'll cut up the car. They'll
never find it or her.

33:38.560 --> 33:40.244
He's right.
She's perfect.

33:41.440 --> 33:42.601
Then we must do it now.

34:11.120 --> 34:12.121
Bring her.

34:24.480 --> 34:25.481
It's padlocked.

34:38.960 --> 34:40.007
Stay close.

34:40.360 --> 34:41.360
I need your eyes.

34:41.440 --> 34:42.440
I'm right behind you.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.082
Sounds like some
kind of a ceremony.

35:04.320 --> 35:09.247
Yeah, a ceremony, where they
bury their victims alive.

35:09.920 --> 35:11.046
Let's hope
we're not late.

35:13.640 --> 35:14.721
Nick, you okay?

35:15.320 --> 35:16.481
I don't think so.

35:16.760 --> 35:17.920
Should we get him
out of here?

35:18.000 --> 35:20.810
No, I can hear something.

35:27.160 --> 35:28.321
We have to get there.

35:52.120 --> 35:53.167
There they are.

35:53.400 --> 35:55.528
- I can't tell what they're doing.
- Me either.

35:55.920 --> 35:56.921
Are they woged?

35:57.560 --> 35:58.561
No.

35:58.880 --> 35:59.927
Can you see
anyone else?

36:00.000 --> 36:01.001
Uh-uh.

36:01.280 --> 36:04.284
Woged or not, I don't like what I'm
seeing, we have to take them down.

36:04.640 --> 36:06.608
- Kali Ma!
- Phansigar!

36:06.680 --> 36:08.569
- Kali Ma!
- Phansigar!

36:11.960 --> 36:12.961
Let's go.

36:13.040 --> 36:14.041
What is happening?

36:14.440 --> 36:15.441
It's my head.

36:15.520 --> 36:17.045
We gotta get him
out of here now.

36:18.280 --> 36:19.320
Where did they go?

36:19.680 --> 36:20.681
Help!

36:24.640 --> 36:25.641
Help!

36:25.760 --> 36:26.807
Stay with Nick.

36:42.960 --> 36:44.007
She's here!

36:47.920 --> 36:48.967
I'm going in.

36:59.320 --> 37:00.924
Monroe!
I need your help!

37:06.600 --> 37:08.921
Nick, I gotta help Hank,
okay? I'll be right back.

37:16.160 --> 37:17.650
Oh, my God,

37:19.480 --> 37:21.403
what the hell
is going on here?

37:26.320 --> 37:27.321
You Okay?

37:28.320 --> 37:29.685
Yeah, she's alive.

37:30.400 --> 37:32.528
Hank, there's a guy
in this one, too.

37:32.840 --> 37:34.524
Help me get her
out first!

37:35.520 --> 37:36.521
Hey!

37:37.000 --> 37:38.001
You all right?

37:51.400 --> 37:52.526
Hank!

37:56.840 --> 37:58.763
You've defiled
our sacred ground.

38:00.480 --> 38:02.209
Now you must be sacrificed.

38:02.280 --> 38:03.281
You first.

38:06.080 --> 38:07.081
Grab him.

38:08.880 --> 38:10.041
Hank!

38:11.680 --> 38:12.681
Nick!

38:16.040 --> 38:17.121
HANK; Nick!

38:19.440 --> 38:21.488
We found another one. But there's
something wrong with him.

38:21.560 --> 38:22.560
He's sick or something.

38:22.600 --> 38:23.960
What do you want us
to do with him?

38:24.160 --> 38:25.366
I'll take care of him.

38:38.160 --> 38:39.207
You're done.

38:41.840 --> 38:42.887
Nick!

38:43.280 --> 38:44.327
Hank!

38:51.360 --> 38:52.480
A Grimm?

38:52.640 --> 38:55.610
Yeah, lam.

39:00.840 --> 39:01.887
Nick!

39:06.600 --> 39:07.840
Nick!
Hank!

39:21.400 --> 39:22.401
Not good.

39:43.920 --> 39:46.082
Dude, you were right,

39:49.680 --> 39:51.091
he was a Phansigar.

39:51.360 --> 39:52.361
I know.

39:54.480 --> 39:55.720
You mean
you saw him woged?

39:57.120 --> 39:58.201
Yeah.

39:59.840 --> 40:01.080
That's awesome!

40:03.920 --> 40:04.921
How is she?

40:06.840 --> 40:09.241
She'll be okay as long as she
doesn't remember any of this.

40:12.080 --> 40:13.081
How are you?

40:14.280 --> 40:15.281
I'm back.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.286
Let's gets you guys
out of there.

40:23.560 --> 40:25.801
Six possible victims
in six graves.

40:25.880 --> 40:27.484
Pretty good chance
the DNA will match

40:27.560 --> 40:29.164
the missing vics
going back six years.

40:29.480 --> 40:30.720
An idol
in their own image?

40:30.840 --> 40:31.841
That's what I'm told.

40:32.360 --> 40:33.361
Monroe do the ID?

40:33.440 --> 40:34.885
Turns out
we didn't need him to.

40:44.440 --> 40:45.487
It's good
to have you back.

40:52.920 --> 40:54.126
It's okay, it's them.

40:58.720 --> 40:59.720
How'd it go?

40:59.760 --> 41:00.761
Pretty good.

41:01.400 --> 41:02.561
How 'bout here?

41:02.920 --> 41:03.921
No problems.

41:05.640 --> 41:07.210
You okay?
Better than.

41:08.800 --> 41:09.801
You can...

41:10.040 --> 41:11.041
Yeah.

41:11.720 --> 41:12.721
I can see them again.

41:16.320 --> 41:17.367
It worked.

41:18.200 --> 41:20.726
The peace and quiet
we never had is over.

41:21.800 --> 41:23.280
Well, then I won't know
what I missed.

41:24.440 --> 41:27.250
Too bad Adalind can't be here to
celebrate with a little champagne,

41:28.120 --> 41:29.565
emphasis on
the "pain" part.

41:39.920 --> 41:40.921
Hey.

41:41.880 --> 41:42.927
You Okay?

41:43.040 --> 41:44.769
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
I'm good.

41:46.200 --> 41:47.611
You're not
the only one anymore.

41:50.080 --> 41:52.287
That's good,
that's really good.

41:53.760 --> 41:55.000
Uh...

41:55.440 --> 41:56.680
Because we got
another problem.

42:04.720 --> 42:06.006
- Oh, boy.
- Josh.

42:08.600 --> 42:09.886
You know how to use
that thing?

42:12.800 --> 42:13.801
Not a clue.
