00:48.899 --> 00:51.697
Sir, she's still closing.
We simply cannot outrun her.

00:51.771 --> 00:53.940
We must surrender
while we still can.

00:54.006 --> 00:56.436
Gun crews...at the ready!

00:56.509 --> 00:57.940
Gun crews at the ready!

01:36.887 --> 01:39.520
- What are you doing?
- Sorry.

01:39.585 --> 01:41.552
Why aren't you on deck
with the crew?

01:41.625 --> 01:44.989
I think the better question is
why aren't they all down here with us?

01:45.054 --> 01:46.356
You could get killed up there.

01:46.421 --> 01:49.427
- Oh, so you're a coward, then?
- Yeah. You, too?

01:49.492 --> 01:51.258
I'm no coward.
I'm a cook.

01:51.331 --> 01:52.860
I've no quarters to man.

01:52.933 --> 01:54.229
What do you think
the captain would do

01:54.302 --> 01:56.239
if he found out
you've abandoned yours?

01:56.304 --> 01:58.638
Well, if he's dead and I'm alive,

01:58.703 --> 02:00.141
I like my chances.

02:00.206 --> 02:02.809
- Fire!
- Starboard side!

02:03.046 --> 02:04.573
They shot the muskets!

02:06.846 --> 02:08.244
Bear up, damn it!

02:08.317 --> 02:09.747
- You're short!
- Bear up!

02:09.812 --> 02:12.775
Sir, they are out of our range.

02:17.211 --> 02:19.081
All crews, fire your...

02:20.378 --> 02:22.247
Get down!

02:26.083 --> 02:27.682
You know who that is out there?

02:27.747 --> 02:29.944
That ship flies the banner
of Captain Flint.

02:31.752 --> 02:33.446
Isn't this your problem, too?

02:33.519 --> 02:36.422
Good cooks are in short supply,
even for criminals.

02:36.487 --> 02:39.820
But you, cowering below decks,
dodging a fight?

02:39.885 --> 02:41.892
They'll gut you for sport.

03:02.665 --> 03:04.796
Give me that.

03:06.026 --> 03:08.129
- What is that?
- That's nothing.

03:08.194 --> 03:10.234
That doesn't seem like nothing.

03:10.299 --> 03:13.234
Well, maybe when
Captain Flint gets here,

03:13.307 --> 03:14.538
we can let him decide.

03:14.603 --> 03:16.474
You wouldn't want to do that.

03:16.539 --> 03:18.339
No? Why not?

03:20.549 --> 03:22.844
Oh.

03:35.364 --> 03:36.963
Fall back!

03:37.028 --> 03:38.825
Fall back!

03:40.832 --> 03:42.493
- Get up!
- Go!

03:43.996 --> 03:45.195
Get out of the way.

03:58.101 --> 03:59.172
Close us in.

03:59.238 --> 04:01.068
Sir, wait. Mr. Fisher.

04:11.651 --> 04:13.691
Muskets at the ready.

04:26.910 --> 04:28.509
Let me in, sir.

04:28.574 --> 04:30.847
- Please, let me inside.
- Move away from that door!

04:30.912 --> 04:33.181
- Sir, there may still be time.
- Move away from the door!

04:33.246 --> 04:35.473
If we do not surrender now,
Flint will kill us all.

04:35.546 --> 04:36.639
Please let me in!

04:36.712 --> 04:38.145
Please, sir, open the door.

04:38.210 --> 04:39.378
Open...

06:19.934 --> 06:22.005
It's over... Argh!

06:27.447 --> 06:29.907
It's done.

06:34.348 --> 06:36.348
Wouldn't you agree?

08:35.212 --> 08:37.418
Can't sell that. Leave it here.

08:40.285 --> 08:41.822
No.

08:44.593 --> 08:46.095
Shit.

08:49.539 --> 08:52.004
Grow up.

08:56.475 --> 08:57.916
What the fuck is this?

08:57.981 --> 09:01.085
Well, it's blocked, Mr. Gates.

09:16.938 --> 09:18.211
Hello.

09:20.782 --> 09:23.887
He couldn't handle the thought
of what you might do to him.

09:23.954 --> 09:26.722
I, on the other hand,

09:26.787 --> 09:29.089
would very much like
to join your crew.

09:31.228 --> 09:33.700
My name is John Silver.

09:33.765 --> 09:36.503
And I happen to be
a very good cook.

09:46.247 --> 09:47.781
Know this...

09:47.847 --> 09:51.255
Now that the fight is over,

09:51.321 --> 09:53.421
you have nothing more
to fear from us today.

09:55.287 --> 09:59.123
Because we know this fight
was not of your making.

09:59.189 --> 10:02.360
It was the choice of our true enemy.

10:02.425 --> 10:05.224
Your true enemy.

10:05.297 --> 10:07.865
The tyrant captain.

10:11.001 --> 10:14.968
Many of us once sailed
on ships like this one.

10:15.033 --> 10:18.104
We know what it is
to be slaves to his whim,

10:18.177 --> 10:20.377
his violence,

10:20.442 --> 10:23.480
his shit wages...

10:23.545 --> 10:26.048
his insufferable stupidity.

10:27.482 --> 10:31.290
So we've made for ourselves
a different life

10:31.355 --> 10:33.689
where we don't rely on wages,

10:33.754 --> 10:36.223
we own a stake,

10:36.288 --> 10:38.025
and where our pleasure isn't a sin.

10:38.097 --> 10:41.328
It's a virtue.

10:41.401 --> 10:44.465
We also know what it's like
to see our brothers die

10:44.538 --> 10:47.538
in the service of no end
other than a tyrant's pride.

10:47.603 --> 10:50.370
This one wants to join.
Says he can cook.

10:50.443 --> 10:54.178
Well, if he keeps that up, this one
won't be the only one looking to join.

10:54.243 --> 10:56.315
- Today is a new day.
- Look at him.

10:56.380 --> 10:57.852
Thinks he's captain already.

10:57.919 --> 11:00.559
Today their crimes have been exposed.

11:00.625 --> 11:03.693
And they will be punished.

11:12.630 --> 11:14.407
We made a full sweep of the hold

11:14.472 --> 11:18.004
and we found eight more
casks of whale oil.

11:18.069 --> 11:19.435
That's all?

11:20.907 --> 11:22.939
Total tally 400.

11:23.012 --> 11:25.643
500, if we manage
to sell the tobacco.

11:25.708 --> 11:29.578
Cameron's broken his arm.
Duffy's been shot in the leg.

11:29.651 --> 11:34.253
After injury payments, we will
net just under $8 per man.

11:34.326 --> 11:35.894
$8?

11:35.959 --> 11:37.927
The crew will not be happy.

11:37.992 --> 11:40.896
When are they ever?

11:45.603 --> 11:48.940
When their end is a hell
of a lot richer than $8.

11:49.013 --> 11:51.412
Here, take a look.

11:53.486 --> 11:56.853
Captain's log. It's all there.

11:56.918 --> 11:59.127
Vazquez, Port Royal.

12:00.426 --> 12:02.666
Told you this was the ship.

12:05.236 --> 12:06.668
Where is the schedule?

12:09.407 --> 12:11.448
Minor obstacle.

12:12.514 --> 12:15.217
But we're getting close.

12:15.282 --> 12:17.520
Let me see if I have this right.

12:17.585 --> 12:19.352
This is the fourth prize in a row

12:19.417 --> 12:22.258
from which the profits
will barely exceed

12:22.323 --> 12:25.057
the expenses it took to win it.

12:25.130 --> 12:27.696
Singleton's out there
trying to convince your crew

12:27.761 --> 12:30.198
to torture that poor bastard
of a captain

12:30.263 --> 12:33.333
simply 'cause he hasn't worked out
how to get them to do it to you.

12:34.902 --> 12:36.965
But all is well
because you've discovered

12:37.037 --> 12:39.404
that the information we can't
tell anybody we're looking for

12:39.469 --> 12:42.736
exists on a page...
that we don't have.

12:42.801 --> 12:44.904
Don't have yet.

12:49.907 --> 12:52.571
Mr. Duffy is dead.

12:52.644 --> 12:55.981
I removed the leg,
but he lost too much blood.

13:02.218 --> 13:04.587
Cut his cock!

13:08.221 --> 13:11.796
Ooh! Yeah!

13:13.028 --> 13:14.698
Is this necessary?

13:18.761 --> 13:21.862
We paid a heavy toll today.
And for what?

13:21.935 --> 13:25.036
We all know the prize won't come
close to evening the scales.

13:25.101 --> 13:28.500
Someone ought to pay the difference.

13:28.573 --> 13:31.267
Talk to me about recruits.

13:39.273 --> 13:42.216
- What's he doing?
- Just give him a minute.

13:43.945 --> 13:45.217
Where's the schedule?

13:47.520 --> 13:50.255
What are you talking about?

13:50.320 --> 13:52.889
The page that was torn
from your log.

13:55.657 --> 13:58.997
If you know where it is,
now would be the time to say so.

14:00.671 --> 14:03.973
Five? You want to bring
on five more men?

14:04.038 --> 14:05.908
A carpenter,
two carpenter's mates,

14:05.972 --> 14:07.611
a gunner's mate and the cook.

14:07.676 --> 14:10.478
Hard to refuse a skilled hand.

14:10.551 --> 14:12.887
Is it their hands you want?

14:12.952 --> 14:14.983
Or their votes?

14:15.056 --> 14:18.056
What a cunning bastard you are.

14:18.121 --> 14:20.560
Squarely in the captain's pocket,

14:20.625 --> 14:23.265
yet you still got the crew
believing you're their advocate.

14:23.330 --> 14:26.433
Shrewdest quartermaster
I've ever come across.

14:26.498 --> 14:29.464
I wonder if you'll afford me
the same wide berth

14:29.537 --> 14:32.640
you give that bastard
once I take his place.

14:34.776 --> 14:38.205
You get the cook.
That's all the ship can afford right now.

14:41.112 --> 14:43.214
I told you, I don't have it.

14:43.279 --> 14:45.683
- One of my men must have taken it.
- Everyone was searched.

14:45.748 --> 14:47.348
Damn it, if I knew more,
I'd tell you.

14:47.413 --> 14:50.018
Now call off your men.

14:50.083 --> 14:52.754
Get off it. Get back.

14:56.455 --> 14:59.388
Pshaw. You can't, can you?

14:59.453 --> 15:03.094
You're their captain,
but you have no control over them.

15:05.265 --> 15:07.896
How long before you're the one
they tie to the mast?

15:12.340 --> 15:14.978
I won't give you the
satisfaction of crying out.

15:15.043 --> 15:16.779
Good for you.

15:16.844 --> 15:19.549
Where are you going?

15:20.782 --> 15:24.189
Justice is about to be done,

15:24.254 --> 15:26.451
and you turn your back.

15:31.600 --> 15:33.196
Sail!

15:43.238 --> 15:44.509
Man-o'-war.

15:44.574 --> 15:46.942
Royal Navy.

15:50.814 --> 15:52.814
The Scarborough.

15:52.887 --> 15:55.056
Scarborough ports in Boston.

15:55.121 --> 15:57.887
Not today she doesn't.

15:57.960 --> 16:00.297
She's got the wind of us.

16:00.363 --> 16:02.594
Cut us loose. Get us under way.

16:23.515 --> 16:25.577
My Boots.

16:27.146 --> 16:29.144
Randall.

16:29.217 --> 16:31.520
We've taken on a new cook.

16:35.058 --> 16:38.593
Randall, we were clear
this job was only temporary.

16:38.658 --> 16:40.256
There's still plenty for you to do.

16:44.729 --> 16:46.496
He'll be all right.

16:46.569 --> 16:50.002
So both watches mess together at six bells.
Don't be late.

16:50.075 --> 16:51.505
Any supplies you need,
see Dufresne.

16:51.570 --> 16:53.472
He'll fund you out of the
ship's maintenance account.

16:53.537 --> 16:55.305
One more thing.

16:55.378 --> 16:58.242
No one gets any special
treatment from you of any kind.

16:58.315 --> 17:00.850
No extra rations,
no preferences in cuts of meat.

17:00.915 --> 17:02.713
Not for me,
not for the quartermaster,

17:02.785 --> 17:05.520
not for the captain.
Here, every man is equal.

17:05.585 --> 17:07.521
- All right?
- Even him?

17:10.724 --> 17:12.564
Randall was the ship's boatswain

17:12.628 --> 17:15.332
before he got beaten to within an inch
of his life while taking a prize.

17:15.396 --> 17:19.136
He lost his wits,
but not our loyalty.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.871
We like Randall.

17:21.944 --> 17:25.248
You, we'll see.

18:11.659 --> 18:13.826
- He has the votes.
- Beg pardon?

18:13.899 --> 18:16.929
Singleton, he has the votes
to remove you as captain.

18:17.001 --> 18:19.568
Not every last one.
Haven't finished canvassing yet,

18:19.633 --> 18:21.273
but when he gets ashore

18:21.338 --> 18:23.809
and he doesn't have to be sneaky
about it, he'll get what he needs.

18:23.874 --> 18:25.632
I thought you said
it would never get to this.

18:25.669 --> 18:27.007
Now hang on.

18:27.042 --> 18:29.609
I thought you said you put loyal
men in all the right places

18:29.682 --> 18:31.315
- so the crew would never turn.
- No, no.

18:31.380 --> 18:33.789
I never said never.
I'm too old to be using that word.

18:33.855 --> 18:36.823
Don't give me that shit.
I told you there would be some lean days

18:36.896 --> 18:38.190
while we tracked Parrish's ship.

18:38.263 --> 18:40.126
You said the crew would weather it.

18:40.191 --> 18:43.098
Days. Lean days.

18:43.171 --> 18:45.105
It's been three months
with no profits to speak of

18:45.170 --> 18:46.433
and nobody knows
what it's all been for

18:46.506 --> 18:48.474
because you don't trust
them with the truth.

18:48.540 --> 18:50.909
I don't trust them with the truth.

18:50.982 --> 18:53.478
So here we are.

18:59.025 --> 19:02.055
Singleton.

19:02.128 --> 19:04.726
They think he has any idea how
to put money in their pockets?

19:04.791 --> 19:07.721
All they know or care
about Singleton right now

19:07.794 --> 19:09.526
is that he isn't you.

19:14.096 --> 19:16.230
I just need a few more days.

19:16.295 --> 19:19.933
The page is gone.
It could be anywhere.

19:19.999 --> 19:22.504
What makes you think all you
need is a few more days?

19:25.377 --> 19:26.712
I'm gonna go and see Richard.

19:26.777 --> 19:29.678
He can help me
recreate the schedule.

19:29.743 --> 19:32.616
- Richard Guthrie?
- Mm-hmm.

19:32.681 --> 19:34.483
You think he's gonna help you?

19:34.556 --> 19:35.819
Yes. Yes, I do.

19:35.892 --> 19:39.260
Let's just for fun
say that he doesn't.

19:39.325 --> 19:40.629
What then?

19:42.230 --> 19:44.364
Then I'll forget about the schedule

19:44.429 --> 19:47.239
and go back to hunting
fat, lazy merchantmen

19:47.304 --> 19:48.504
and everyone will be content.

19:48.577 --> 19:51.607
This is one of those times

19:51.672 --> 19:55.477
where we pretend that we both
don't know that you're lying.

19:59.413 --> 20:01.579
Landfall.

20:01.652 --> 20:02.818
We're home.

21:02.463 --> 21:03.997
Is this English soil?

21:04.062 --> 21:06.827
It was once. Now it ain't.

21:06.900 --> 21:08.530
Whose is it?

21:09.900 --> 21:12.036
Ours.

21:18.214 --> 21:20.613
Wait, I don't understand.
The captain asked for me to go?

21:20.678 --> 21:21.844
Yes, in a manner of speaking.

21:21.917 --> 21:24.343
He doesn't know
I'm coming, does he?

21:24.416 --> 21:26.678
No, but I have business here,
so the job falls to you.

21:26.751 --> 21:28.415
And what is the job exactly?

21:28.480 --> 21:30.183
Captain's gonna ask
Richard Guthrie for a favor.

21:30.248 --> 21:31.918
Mr. Guthrie is going to say no.

21:31.982 --> 21:34.651
When that happens, the captain
will most likely react poorly.

21:34.716 --> 21:36.049
Your job is to restrain him.

21:38.954 --> 21:40.722
Restrain him, you say?

21:40.787 --> 21:43.564
No cargo moves off this island

21:43.629 --> 21:45.933
without Mr. Guthrie's
ships and connections.

21:45.999 --> 21:49.765
The last crew that ran afoul of him
couldn't buy or sell shit for two months.

21:49.838 --> 21:52.372
That's an outcome I'd like to avoid.

21:52.437 --> 21:53.804
Wait.

21:53.869 --> 21:55.973
He never listens to me.

21:58.412 --> 22:01.516
Nonsense. You're a highly
regarded member of this crew.

22:01.581 --> 22:05.778
And I can assure you the captain
regards your input more than you know.

22:08.352 --> 22:10.078
Billy's going with you.

22:10.151 --> 22:12.183
Who's Billy?

22:18.162 --> 22:20.062
What exactly happens to all this?

22:20.127 --> 22:22.829
It goes to the Guthries.

22:22.894 --> 22:24.568
They pay up front for it,

22:24.633 --> 22:26.462
take it someplace civilized
and sell it.

22:26.535 --> 22:27.901
The Guthries?

22:27.967 --> 22:29.269
Mate, no offense,

22:29.334 --> 22:32.467
but the faster we get this loaded,
the faster I can get up the hill

22:32.532 --> 22:35.369
and into the arms of
my sweet, sweet Charlotte.

22:58.649 --> 23:00.288
Your recipes?

23:00.353 --> 23:02.919
I left them with our
captain for safekeeping,

23:02.992 --> 23:04.857
but I don't see them with
the rest of the journals.

23:04.921 --> 23:07.659
All the volumes
from the prize are here

23:07.732 --> 23:09.227
unless the captain took it.

23:09.300 --> 23:12.866
In which case,
it's in his cabin on the ship.

23:12.931 --> 23:14.801
He likes his books.

23:22.343 --> 23:24.741
- Is that him?
- Is this necessary?

23:24.806 --> 23:26.309
He's just a cook.

23:26.374 --> 23:29.275
He meets the new ones.
No exceptions.

23:29.348 --> 23:31.641
Um, what's going on?

23:31.714 --> 23:33.311
Who wants to meet me?

23:33.376 --> 23:35.340
Blackbeard.

23:51.221 --> 23:54.881
Whatever you do,
don't show fear.

24:25.416 --> 24:27.383
You're not Blackbeard.

24:32.755 --> 24:34.962
Oh. I see.

24:35.027 --> 24:36.961
If you get lost in there,
give us a yell.

24:48.974 --> 24:50.878
Rules are rules.

24:50.944 --> 24:52.751
And you are ours.

25:18.479 --> 25:20.454
Mr. Gates.

25:24.723 --> 25:26.488
I need a moment with your boss.

25:28.666 --> 25:30.267
Not a good time.

25:30.332 --> 25:32.004
Get the fuck out.

25:32.069 --> 25:34.203
You want to run at first sign
of trouble, be my guest,

25:34.268 --> 25:36.002
but don't expect me
to fucking help you.

25:37.572 --> 25:39.277
And that goes for all of you.

25:39.342 --> 25:41.076
If you want to hunt,
my door is open.

25:41.141 --> 25:43.443
But if the mere whiff of the
navy is too much for you,

25:43.515 --> 25:46.053
then God bless
and get the fuck out.

25:46.118 --> 25:48.390
Fuck yourself, cunt.

25:57.569 --> 25:59.903
Did you just
tell me to fuck myself?

26:04.172 --> 26:05.812
Mr. Scott, who is this man?

26:05.877 --> 26:07.308
Mr. Sanderson.

26:07.381 --> 26:09.885
Crews with Captain Burgess
of the Trinity.

26:09.950 --> 26:11.822
How much was their last haul?

26:11.887 --> 26:14.957
Nearly a thousand in profit.
Best tally in months.

26:19.861 --> 26:22.457
Well, Mr. Sanderson.

26:22.522 --> 26:24.992
Pleased to be in your company.

26:25.057 --> 26:27.023
Do you know why?

26:29.462 --> 26:31.492
Because you're an earner.

26:31.565 --> 26:34.227
Can I tell you what happens
when I stand near an earner?

26:38.670 --> 26:40.640
My pussy gets wet.

26:42.578 --> 26:46.817
In which case,
I will go fuck myself.

26:51.359 --> 26:53.495
Mistress Guthrie.

26:53.560 --> 26:56.263
Now what the fuck do you want?

26:56.336 --> 26:58.662
I wish you'd get
control of your men.

26:58.735 --> 27:00.905
They come in here spouting off

27:00.970 --> 27:02.642
they've seen
His Majesty's Navy out there

27:02.707 --> 27:04.504
and I have three crews
pulling orders

27:04.577 --> 27:06.742
because they haven't got enough
balls to get back in the water.

27:06.807 --> 27:08.541
I'll make sure to keep
that in mind, ma'am,

27:08.606 --> 27:12.045
but right now the Scarborough
is the least of my concerns.

27:12.110 --> 27:13.917
We have an agitator.

27:15.648 --> 27:16.950
Fuck does that mean?

27:17.015 --> 27:19.348
Challenger for the captaincy
of the Walrus

27:19.420 --> 27:22.791
capitalizing on our friend's
recent rough patch.

27:24.193 --> 27:26.128
I expect him to call a vote soon.

27:27.562 --> 27:29.402
I expect it to be close.

27:29.467 --> 27:32.473
Flint's got morale problems.
What do you want me to do about it?

27:34.044 --> 27:36.581
I need money to shore up support.

27:36.646 --> 27:38.719
You want a loan?

27:38.784 --> 27:41.452
Flint's made you more money
than any captain here.

27:41.525 --> 27:43.724
But lately he hasn't.

27:43.797 --> 27:46.029
Yeah, well, that will change.
But mark my words,

27:46.094 --> 27:48.829
without that money,
the most valuable captain on this island

27:48.902 --> 27:51.271
will be out of a job tomorrow.

27:53.171 --> 27:57.284
Think of it as an
investment in the future.

27:57.349 --> 27:59.546
You steal cargo
at the end of a sword.

27:59.619 --> 28:02.511
We sell that cargo to markets
that will never have you.

28:02.584 --> 28:06.456
When you are strong,
you are a necessary evil.

28:06.521 --> 28:09.690
When you are not strong,
you are likely soon to be dead.

28:11.026 --> 28:13.362
But what you are not ever

28:13.427 --> 28:15.732
is a sound investment.

28:19.971 --> 28:21.367
How much would you need?

28:27.137 --> 28:30.312
1,000 pieces of eight,
give or take.

28:41.928 --> 28:43.662
Take this to Virgil.

28:45.802 --> 28:48.109
He'll see that you get
what you need.

28:48.144 --> 28:50.652
Thank you, ma'am.

28:57.338 --> 28:58.841
What?

28:58.906 --> 29:00.504
I'm wondering what it is

29:00.577 --> 29:03.005
exactly
you think you just purchased.

29:03.078 --> 29:04.845
It's my money, isn't it?

29:04.910 --> 29:07.074
Must I answer for how I spend it?

29:07.139 --> 29:09.843
To me, no.

29:09.916 --> 29:12.179
But this enterprise
belongs to your father.

29:12.252 --> 29:16.045
And I do not believe
he would approve of this...

29:16.110 --> 29:18.780
investment.

29:18.845 --> 29:22.320
Well, then I suppose it's a good
thing that my father isn't here.

29:41.037 --> 29:44.506
Mr. Smith to see Mr. Guthrie.

29:47.169 --> 29:48.703
He's not expecting me.

29:58.649 --> 30:01.182
What does the crew
think of me, Billy?

30:02.718 --> 30:03.819
Beg your pardon?

30:03.884 --> 30:05.683
You're the ship's boatswain.

30:05.756 --> 30:08.755
You know what's said
behind my back.

30:09.924 --> 30:11.025
Um...

30:11.090 --> 30:14.960
I know they've always
found me aloof,

30:15.025 --> 30:17.330
too educated.

30:17.395 --> 30:19.729
But now it seems they feel I'm...

30:19.802 --> 30:22.664
Too weak.

30:22.737 --> 30:25.433
I was gonna say unlucky.

30:27.540 --> 30:28.907
So that's the thinking.

30:28.979 --> 30:31.108
We've been attacking ships
with light loads

30:31.181 --> 30:33.412
because I'm too weak
to do otherwise.

30:33.484 --> 30:35.651
Is that what you think?

30:37.547 --> 30:39.481
I...

30:41.017 --> 30:42.888
What the hell are you doing here?

30:44.688 --> 30:47.189
Now is that any way
to greet a friend?

30:47.254 --> 30:49.222
I much prefer that way.

30:53.029 --> 30:55.661
A sugar factor from Carolina.

30:55.734 --> 30:58.669
Who purchases stolen
cargo from you

30:58.734 --> 31:00.667
because he trusts me

31:00.732 --> 31:04.235
because I have cultivated
his confidence.

31:04.308 --> 31:08.245
And because I keep him from
ever having to lay eyes on you.

31:09.909 --> 31:13.479
Then the sooner we get down
to business, the better.

31:31.157 --> 31:33.258
A whore for every finger
on your hand,

31:33.323 --> 31:35.457
but your eyes
kept drifting to this.

31:36.794 --> 31:39.725
Tell me, what is it
that is so precious to you?

31:39.790 --> 31:42.259
One scream will bring Mr. Noonan.

31:42.325 --> 31:43.963
Bring him.

31:44.028 --> 31:46.627
I'll let him know his whores like
to steal from their customers.

31:46.700 --> 31:49.200
And he can let
your new captain know

31:49.266 --> 31:51.370
you have withheld something
of great value

31:51.435 --> 31:54.471
that rightly belonged
to his latest prize.

31:58.334 --> 32:00.542
So, what now?

32:01.976 --> 32:03.542
This is to sell, is it not?

32:03.607 --> 32:06.842
But you cannot know
who best to sell it to.

32:06.907 --> 32:08.746
I could know that.

32:08.811 --> 32:11.116
Hmm, and what's that
going to cost me?

32:11.181 --> 32:14.216
Half.

32:14.282 --> 32:17.283
Pleasure should be shared equally.

32:17.356 --> 32:19.822
It's the only way
to avoid hurt feelings.

32:21.191 --> 32:24.032
Look, this deal,

32:24.097 --> 32:26.335
it's really a terrible idea.

32:26.400 --> 32:29.037
There are so many
ways it could go wrong.

32:29.102 --> 32:31.371
Me, I can't help myself.

32:31.437 --> 32:34.833
I see an opportunity, I take it.

32:34.906 --> 32:37.639
It's a sickness. Truly.

32:37.704 --> 32:41.343
But you,
you can still walk away.

32:41.408 --> 32:42.911
<i>Bien.</i>

32:42.975 --> 32:44.309
Now tell me what it is.

32:50.811 --> 32:52.880
I don't know.

33:22.912 --> 33:26.048
You're not going to throw
your support behind Singleton.

33:27.378 --> 33:30.786
I wondered when
this visit would come.

33:47.771 --> 33:49.971
The vote is closer than you think.

33:50.044 --> 33:52.340
I know this

33:52.412 --> 33:56.146
because I brought
back 16 votes today.

33:56.211 --> 33:58.344
Nelson's men are always for sale.

33:58.409 --> 34:00.987
Paying Muldoon got me the Welsh.

34:01.052 --> 34:05.490
As of now,
Singleton is only up eight votes.

34:05.555 --> 34:08.627
And you and your men hold nine.

34:08.692 --> 34:09.924
So...

34:09.998 --> 34:12.533
The captain's fate is in our hands.

34:12.598 --> 34:15.297
In your hands.
Your men vote with you.

34:16.804 --> 34:18.702
And how much are you
willing to pay

34:18.775 --> 34:20.574
for those votes?

34:20.639 --> 34:22.879
Well...

34:22.942 --> 34:25.106
Nothing.

34:25.170 --> 34:27.346
Spent everything I had
getting this far.

34:27.411 --> 34:29.010
Hmm.

34:29.074 --> 34:31.346
Think about your men.

34:31.411 --> 34:33.618
Think about their future.

34:33.683 --> 34:37.018
Is it their future
you wish to protect

34:37.083 --> 34:38.818
or your friend's?

34:41.289 --> 34:43.918
What difference does it make?

34:50.061 --> 34:52.059
And you will pay us, obviously,

34:52.132 --> 34:55.266
from the very first prize we take.

34:57.763 --> 35:00.264
I assumed that went without saying.

35:21.925 --> 35:24.028
You're in a festive mood.

35:27.368 --> 35:29.166
What do you want, Rackham?

35:29.239 --> 35:33.102
I'd hoped to toast your coronation
as captain of the Walrus.

35:33.175 --> 35:36.975
Alas, I'm not so sure
that's where we're headed.

35:58.368 --> 36:01.839
You should keep your distance till
I signal you to return for me.

36:01.904 --> 36:04.475
If anything should happen
and I don't return soon...

36:04.540 --> 36:07.606
- I leave.
- Smart girl.

36:39.467 --> 36:45.076
Let me tell you a story
about a Spaniard named Vazquez.

36:46.614 --> 36:50.715
A few weeks ago he staggers
into a tavern on Port Royal.

36:50.780 --> 36:53.851
Takes a seat next to
an English merchant captain.

36:55.355 --> 36:58.520
Vazquez, it turns out, is dying.

36:58.585 --> 37:01.519
Bleeding to death from
a knife wound to the belly.

37:01.592 --> 37:04.024
The knife wound was courtesy

37:04.089 --> 37:06.625
of his former employer,

37:06.697 --> 37:08.830
La Casa de Contratacion,
in Seville.

37:08.895 --> 37:10.365
Colonial intelligence.

37:10.430 --> 37:12.766
Naval, more specifically.

37:12.831 --> 37:15.134
One of their top agents
in the Americas.

37:15.199 --> 37:19.008
Responsible for the security
of one particular ship.

37:21.376 --> 37:23.711
A ship with a cargo so rich,

37:23.776 --> 37:27.185
the king of Spain is very
anxious to see it launched.

37:28.617 --> 37:31.045
Vazquez warned
that it was too late.

37:31.118 --> 37:32.653
Storm season was upon them

37:32.719 --> 37:34.520
and no escort could
be mustered to guard her.

37:35.961 --> 37:38.824
But his superiors
demanded that he sign off.

37:38.896 --> 37:41.664
They advised him that if he
couldn't arrange for an escort,

37:41.729 --> 37:45.170
he should plot a course for the ship
unknown to anyone but her captain

37:45.235 --> 37:47.704
and consider that route
to be a state secret

37:47.769 --> 37:49.504
of the highest order.

37:49.569 --> 37:52.702
When Vazquez refused
and threatened to report

37:52.775 --> 37:54.909
his concerns to the court,

37:54.975 --> 37:56.847
things got ugly.

38:01.678 --> 38:03.950
The ship in question...

38:06.288 --> 38:08.191
L'Urca de Lima.

38:09.728 --> 38:13.959
The largest Spanish treasure galleon
in the Americas.

38:14.032 --> 38:15.727
According to Vazquez,

38:15.800 --> 38:22.843
total cargo in excess of $5 million.

38:22.908 --> 38:24.577
Marvelous story, Captain.

38:26.713 --> 38:29.608
And how exactly
did you come to hear it?

38:29.681 --> 38:34.079
A spy in my employ in Port Royal
who overheard the conversation.

38:34.152 --> 38:36.686
I must admit,
I harbored my doubts

38:36.751 --> 38:40.053
to its authenticity
right up until yesterday

38:40.118 --> 38:42.924
when I took the merchant
captain's ship

38:42.989 --> 38:46.788
and found Vazquez's story
neatly written into his log.

38:48.157 --> 38:50.258
Most impressive.

38:50.331 --> 38:53.792
It sounds like your plan
is neatly resolved.

38:53.865 --> 38:56.435
What could you possibly
want of me?

38:56.500 --> 39:00.067
Not quite entirely resolved.

39:01.236 --> 39:03.307
A page was torn from the log

39:03.372 --> 39:05.579
with the Urca's course
and schedule written on it.

39:05.644 --> 39:08.614
Now I could recreate it
from what's left,

39:08.686 --> 39:10.287
but I'd need help.

39:10.352 --> 39:13.254
Someone with expert knowledge
of Spanish operations.

39:15.360 --> 39:17.255
Your man in Havana.

39:19.164 --> 39:21.032
I need you to make an introduction.

39:24.535 --> 39:26.965
Absolutely not.

39:30.605 --> 39:35.109
Five million Spanish dollars.

39:36.742 --> 39:39.013
When I take that ship,
you stand to gain...

39:39.078 --> 39:40.981
When you take it?

39:41.046 --> 39:44.149
Do you have idea how heavily
armed that ship is?

39:44.222 --> 39:47.155
- Even without an escort.
- The risk is all mine.

39:47.220 --> 39:50.091
The risk is not all yours.

39:50.156 --> 39:53.096
If I were to even
make inquiries about this

39:53.161 --> 39:55.769
with colonial intelligence,
they'd see me dead.

39:55.834 --> 39:58.768
You may have nothing to lose,

39:58.833 --> 40:02.904
but I have a future planned
I'm not so willing to throw away.

40:04.705 --> 40:06.681
Let me make myself plain.

40:08.012 --> 40:10.082
I will have that name.

40:14.047 --> 40:17.486
Billy, put your pistol
on Mr. Guthrie here.

40:28.199 --> 40:29.895
The name, please.

40:29.970 --> 40:33.441
I'm telling you it is simply
out of the question.

40:34.737 --> 40:36.606
Captain!

40:46.121 --> 40:48.186
- Hold here.
- Aye, Captain.

40:51.525 --> 40:52.764
What is it?

40:58.270 --> 41:01.702
Captain Hume of
His Majesty's Ship the Scarborough.

41:06.045 --> 41:08.477
Captain Hume.

41:08.542 --> 41:09.877
You've caught me at business.

41:09.950 --> 41:13.183
I must ask you
to return another day.

41:13.248 --> 41:14.854
My apologies, Mr. Guthrie.

41:14.919 --> 41:17.349
May I ask

41:17.422 --> 41:19.256
what sort of business?

41:19.329 --> 41:21.096
I'm sorry?

41:21.161 --> 41:24.697
I asked what sort of business
you're conducting with these men.

41:24.762 --> 41:27.263
Sugar merchants from the colonies

41:27.336 --> 41:30.768
with business I'd just as soon
conclude without interruption.

41:30.841 --> 41:34.773
So please, if you'll excuse us.

41:34.838 --> 41:37.407
Tell me something, Mr. Guthrie.

41:37.480 --> 41:39.172
Do you have gossip here?

41:39.245 --> 41:41.242
Gossip?

41:41.307 --> 41:43.242
I've often wondered
if it can survive

41:43.307 --> 41:45.412
in so remote a location.

41:45.485 --> 41:49.184
You see, gossip is what
holds civilization together.

41:49.249 --> 41:51.985
It reinforces shame.

41:52.050 --> 41:54.354
And without shame, well,

41:54.419 --> 41:57.323
the world is a very dangerous place.

41:57.396 --> 41:59.530
I'm sorry.

41:59.595 --> 42:01.499
I don't understand.

42:02.869 --> 42:05.332
Do you know what the gossip
is in London about you?

42:07.002 --> 42:09.569
The gossip is that
you make your profits

42:09.634 --> 42:11.739
selling ill-gotten cargo

42:11.804 --> 42:14.978
stolen by the pirates
of Providence Island.

42:15.043 --> 42:17.641
There's no truth to that.

42:19.378 --> 42:22.162
We'll certainly find out,
won't we?

42:22.197 --> 42:25.479
Take them into custody.
All of them.

42:39.878 --> 42:41.918
You told me you
and your men were with me.

42:41.983 --> 42:43.486
You gave me your word.

42:43.551 --> 42:46.318
I do what's best for my family.

42:46.383 --> 42:47.855
I'm what's best for your family.

42:47.920 --> 42:49.425
Flint has fucked us all
for long enough.

42:49.490 --> 42:51.731
Can't you see that?

43:40.270 --> 43:42.605
Captain Vane.

43:50.249 --> 43:51.973
Do I even want to know?

43:52.046 --> 43:54.844
It's been a long day.

43:54.909 --> 43:56.718
But I am up one vote.

43:56.783 --> 43:58.950
Looks like Flint is safe.

44:09.998 --> 44:11.999
Mr. Gates.

44:16.471 --> 44:20.539
When he didn't return,
we came looking for him.

44:20.604 --> 44:22.538
I found him here.

44:24.211 --> 44:26.177
He said one word before he died...

44:26.242 --> 44:28.511
Vane.

44:30.438 --> 44:32.373
Damn butcher.

44:32.446 --> 44:35.846
Yeah, but did you figure
him for a clever one?

44:35.911 --> 44:37.446
I know what you're thinking.

44:39.286 --> 44:42.421
And we'd lose that fight.
At least today.

44:44.558 --> 44:46.789
- Fuck that.
- Eleanor.

44:46.862 --> 44:48.094
Eleanor!

44:59.038 --> 45:01.977
Awfully pleased
with himself, isn't he?

45:02.042 --> 45:05.417
Why shouldn't he be?
With Mosiah gone,

45:05.483 --> 45:08.554
Flint no longer holds
the votes to remain captain.

45:08.619 --> 45:11.984
Once the Walrus's men realize
Mr. Singleton's limitations,

45:12.057 --> 45:15.993
we'll have a host of talented
defectors eager to swell our ranks.

45:16.058 --> 45:18.496
And he only gets stronger.

45:18.561 --> 45:20.391
He doesn't get shit
without you bringing up

45:20.464 --> 45:22.462
that Singleton business
in the first place.

45:22.527 --> 45:26.169
Yes, well, we all
have our roles to play.

45:28.073 --> 45:30.938
I want to fuck.

45:31.012 --> 45:33.309
What, because of what I just said?

45:33.382 --> 45:35.811
Fuck's it matter to you?

45:35.884 --> 45:37.452
All right, then.

45:41.422 --> 45:42.988
Ms. Guthrie.

45:51.704 --> 45:55.039
Ooh!

46:11.621 --> 46:14.855
Now, would you like to tell
me what that was all about?

46:17.326 --> 46:19.492
You fucked me tonight.

46:19.557 --> 46:22.024
Flint, his captaincy,
I had an interest.

46:22.089 --> 46:24.728
You'll live.

46:25.225 --> 46:26.664
You'll make it right.

46:26.729 --> 46:28.758
Why would I do that?

46:28.831 --> 46:30.693
'Cause if you don't,
you're finished here.

46:30.766 --> 46:33.364
I won't sell another
ounce of your cargo.

46:33.429 --> 46:36.971
See how long you'll last as captain
when your crew can't get paid.

46:37.036 --> 46:40.402
Eleanor, your father sells my cargo.

46:40.468 --> 46:42.602
Whatever it is
you're so upset about,

46:42.675 --> 46:44.640
I doubt he feels the same.

46:44.705 --> 46:49.240
When I tell him you put our biggest
earner out of business, he'll...

46:49.313 --> 46:52.477
Remind you that Flint hasn't been your
biggest earner in quite some time.

46:52.542 --> 46:56.316
You'll also be reminded of what you've
always known but never accepted,

46:56.381 --> 46:58.213
that if forced,

46:58.286 --> 47:02.313
your father will always
choose profits over daughters.

47:06.556 --> 47:09.754
Hate your father?
I wouldn't blame you.

47:09.827 --> 47:11.994
Hate me, too, if you'd like.

47:12.059 --> 47:14.466
And if you feel the need,
cling to Flint

47:14.531 --> 47:18.435
and his legend and a past the
rest of us have long outgrown.

47:18.500 --> 47:20.506
But make no mistake about it,

47:20.571 --> 47:23.805
whatever future this place has left,

47:23.878 --> 47:25.477
I'm it.

47:25.542 --> 47:29.583
And if you ever challenge me
again in front of my crew,

47:29.648 --> 47:32.287
I may just forget
that I loved you once.

47:49.168 --> 47:50.976
Have you found us a buyer?

47:51.041 --> 47:53.178
Patience, mon cher.

47:53.243 --> 47:56.283
Few here are willing
to cross your captain.

47:56.348 --> 48:00.421
And those I have in mind
must be approached with caution.

48:09.494 --> 48:11.629
Excuse me.

48:41.308 --> 48:42.580
Who did this?

48:45.686 --> 48:47.651
Him?

48:47.716 --> 48:49.516
I started it.

49:02.961 --> 49:05.001
Why would you do this?

49:07.939 --> 49:10.401
Please.

49:13.242 --> 49:16.441
When the sea grows rough,

49:16.513 --> 49:18.912
you come to Max.

49:22.820 --> 49:24.852
Max is your harbor.

49:26.125 --> 49:28.324
It's all coming apart.

49:30.356 --> 49:32.892
This place, I can feel it
slipping away...

49:41.907 --> 49:44.772
You are so ready to see the worst.

49:50.345 --> 49:52.645
You cannot see

49:52.710 --> 49:55.676
what is right in front
of your nose.

50:31.444 --> 50:34.849
The world is so full of surprises.

50:36.852 --> 50:40.090
Let it surprise you.

51:08.250 --> 51:09.817
What are you doing?

51:11.521 --> 51:14.518
I don't believe any of the men
have ever met him face-to-face.

51:14.584 --> 51:16.917
We'll need to find
a safe place to stash him

51:16.990 --> 51:19.052
before he comes to
and starts talking.

51:19.125 --> 51:22.018
But in the meantime, I certainly don't
want his clothes giving him away.

51:24.322 --> 51:26.489
You're gonna pretend that
isn't Richard Guthrie?

51:26.562 --> 51:28.592
Soon word of Guthrie's arrest

51:28.665 --> 51:30.958
will hit the customs
houses of Charleston,

51:31.031 --> 51:33.526
New York, and eventually Boston.

51:33.599 --> 51:36.626
Sooner than later,
Nassau will be unable

51:36.699 --> 51:39.634
to sell to any legitimate market
in the Americas.

51:39.699 --> 51:41.666
I don't want the men
panicked about that

51:41.731 --> 51:43.405
when I need them
focused on the Urca.

51:43.470 --> 51:46.607
Jesus. Can you hear yourself?

51:47.944 --> 51:50.480
You spent months lying to us

51:50.553 --> 51:52.215
about what it is
we're hunting out here.

51:52.280 --> 51:54.780
And now when it's clear
it can't possibly succeed,

51:54.853 --> 51:56.018
you want to keep lying.

51:59.650 --> 52:02.756
Maybe Singleton is right.
Maybe it's time we made a change.

52:10.096 --> 52:11.633
Think carefully.

52:13.068 --> 52:15.698
What lies ahead, Mr. Singleton
cannot see you through.

52:15.771 --> 52:17.000
And what is that?

52:18.537 --> 52:19.873
There's a war coming, Billy.

52:19.938 --> 52:21.072
One ship isn't a war.

52:21.137 --> 52:22.839
One ship isn't what's coming.

52:22.904 --> 52:24.910
That man Hume,

52:24.975 --> 52:27.173
the captain of the Scarborough
told you as much.

52:27.246 --> 52:30.277
When a king brands us pirates,

52:30.342 --> 52:33.244
he doesn't mean
to make us adversaries.

52:33.317 --> 52:35.715
He doesn't mean
to make us criminals.

52:35.780 --> 52:38.219
He means to make us monsters.

52:38.284 --> 52:42.692
For that's the only way his
God-fearing, taxpaying subjects

52:42.758 --> 52:46.896
can make sense of men who keep
what is theirs and fear no one.

52:46.969 --> 52:49.400
When I say there's a war coming,

52:49.465 --> 52:51.672
I don't mean with the Scarborough.

52:51.737 --> 52:54.177
I don't mean
with King George or England.

52:56.946 --> 53:00.313
Civilization is coming

53:00.378 --> 53:03.114
and it means to exterminate us.

53:05.353 --> 53:06.784
If we are to survive,

53:06.849 --> 53:10.397
we must unite behind our own king.

53:12.663 --> 53:14.830
We have no kings here.

53:14.903 --> 53:18.566
I am your king.

53:43.153 --> 53:45.757
The crew is assembled
for council.

53:45.822 --> 53:47.325
Mr. Singleton has called for a vote

53:47.390 --> 53:50.603
to select himself as the
new captain of this crew.

53:52.036 --> 53:53.570
I need a minute.

54:01.776 --> 54:02.942
What happened with Richard?

54:09.078 --> 54:10.878
Oh, Jesus.

54:25.531 --> 54:27.870
I thought you said
you'd deal with this.

54:29.606 --> 54:31.143
It fell through.

54:33.914 --> 54:35.881
You need to figure out what
you're gonna say to them.

54:35.954 --> 54:37.554
They don't care about
anything I have to say.

54:37.619 --> 54:39.827
Well, you need to make 'em care!

54:39.892 --> 54:42.625
Or I don't know what happens next.

54:48.534 --> 54:50.608
I can stall 'em
for a few more minutes.

54:54.407 --> 54:56.847
And I am sorry.

56:03.673 --> 56:05.138
I'm sorry.

56:06.676 --> 56:08.279
For the short hauls.

56:08.352 --> 56:09.951
For the trouble I've caused.

56:10.016 --> 56:12.685
But most importantly,

56:12.751 --> 56:15.423
for the disregard
it seems I've shown you.

56:17.593 --> 56:20.099
The most important
element of a healthy ship

56:20.164 --> 56:22.298
is trust.

56:22.371 --> 56:25.204
Trust between men.

56:25.269 --> 56:27.645
Trust between captain and crew.

56:29.614 --> 56:31.780
Without it,

56:31.845 --> 56:33.813
a ship is doomed.

56:36.520 --> 56:39.556
For the past few months,

56:39.621 --> 56:42.289
you and I have been on the trail

56:42.354 --> 56:45.922
of a prize so rich,

56:45.995 --> 56:49.024
it could upset the very
nature of our world.

56:50.624 --> 56:53.295
And for that reason,
I felt it necessary

56:53.360 --> 56:55.935
to keep it secret.

56:56.000 --> 56:58.636
I didn't trust you.

56:58.709 --> 57:00.372
And that was my mistake.

57:02.781 --> 57:05.316
Right now I would like to
tell you that that prize

57:05.381 --> 57:07.979
is within our grasp
and we are close.

57:09.620 --> 57:11.019
So close.

57:11.083 --> 57:13.817
But it would appear
that my concerns

57:13.882 --> 57:16.017
about secrecy had merit.

57:17.993 --> 57:21.327
Someone on this crew
discovered my plans...

57:23.191 --> 57:25.432
and tore from this log
the very page

57:25.497 --> 57:29.634
necessary to discover that prize.

57:31.233 --> 57:33.272
Stole it for their own gain.

57:33.337 --> 57:36.041
Stole it from us.

57:39.413 --> 57:41.716
And then

57:41.781 --> 57:44.822
stoked your resentment
to cover his crime...

57:46.594 --> 57:49.296
and make himself your captain.

57:49.361 --> 57:51.760
What?

57:53.832 --> 57:56.302
I don't know
what he's talking about.

57:56.367 --> 57:59.937
That's a very serious accusation,
Captain.

58:00.010 --> 58:02.611
Thievery is punishable by death.

58:02.676 --> 58:05.148
As is a false accusal of the same.

58:10.790 --> 58:13.993
Then, as per the articles,

58:14.066 --> 58:16.633
the accused has a choice.

58:16.698 --> 58:18.697
He can submit to a trial.

58:18.769 --> 58:21.033
With who as judge? You?

58:21.106 --> 58:22.970
No.

58:23.042 --> 58:24.767
No fucking way.

58:29.637 --> 58:31.442
Then swords.

58:34.644 --> 58:36.843
Perhaps it's better this way.

58:38.514 --> 58:40.850
Be rid of you once and for all.

59:18.944 --> 59:21.140
Come on!

59:22.509 --> 59:24.515
Come on, Singleton!

59:45.112 --> 59:47.046
Get up!

59:49.553 --> 59:50.848
Come on!

01:01:36.564 --> 01:01:38.235
It's the stolen page.

01:01:47.471 --> 01:01:50.572
Friends,

01:01:50.637 --> 01:01:52.278
brothers...

01:01:55.078 --> 01:01:57.611
the prize that you and I
have been pursuing...

01:01:59.476 --> 01:02:01.450
is L'Urca de Lima.

01:02:03.019 --> 01:02:05.115
The Hulk.

01:02:05.187 --> 01:02:07.555
A prize of almost unimaginable value.

01:02:09.787 --> 01:02:12.919
Now with this page securely
in our possession,

01:02:12.992 --> 01:02:15.192
we can begin our hunt.

01:02:16.898 --> 01:02:18.729
And we will succeed

01:02:18.794 --> 01:02:20.631
no matter the cost.

01:02:20.696 --> 01:02:22.198
No matter the struggle.

01:02:22.263 --> 01:02:25.700
I will see that prize is yours.

01:02:27.132 --> 01:02:30.205
I'm not just gonna make you rich.

01:02:30.270 --> 01:02:33.238
I'm not just gonna make you strong.

01:02:33.311 --> 01:02:36.480
I'm gonna make you
the princes of the New World!

01:02:41.049 --> 01:02:44.594
Flint! Flint! Flint! Flint!

01:02:44.659 --> 01:02:47.059
Flint! Flint! Flint!

01:03:05.954 --> 01:03:08.156
He's downstairs.

01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:31.863
Can I help you?

01:03:33.159 --> 01:03:35.830
Perhaps we can help each other.

01:03:37.968 --> 01:03:41.268
I think I have something
you might want to buy.
