00:56.473 --> 00:59.476
That's how long it takes
from Camarines Sur to get to Manila.

01:02.771 --> 01:03.730
That's a long time.

01:12.155 --> 01:13.782
Especially when you're alone.

01:16.826 --> 01:18.411
But you don't have to be.

01:24.042 --> 01:25.376
I'll stand by my decision.

01:30.632 --> 01:31.841
I can do this alone.

01:32.634 --> 01:33.551
By myself…

01:36.930 --> 01:38.556
I'm doing the right thing.

01:48.274 --> 01:49.818
I did everything I could.

01:50.819 --> 01:52.195
But it's not there anymore.

01:54.656 --> 01:57.784
How can I bring you back to life
when you're not there anymore?

01:59.702 --> 02:01.287
This is where it ends.

02:11.214 --> 02:13.216
Why are you looking at me like that?

02:13.299 --> 02:15.301
I can't help it, my wife's so beautiful.

02:15.844 --> 02:19.180
Wife? As if we've been married that long.

02:28.356 --> 02:29.816
That's a long time.

02:30.316 --> 02:33.194
It's not. That's only 41 and a half hours.

02:37.657 --> 02:40.869
What's with all the math?
Are you trying to impress me?

02:41.411 --> 02:44.164
What for? There's no need
for that, you're already mine.

02:45.623 --> 02:50.378
Like forever and ever?

02:59.095 --> 03:00.388
I have an idea.

03:02.515 --> 03:06.269
There he goes
writing his little songs again.

03:13.860 --> 03:19.782
TILL THE END OF…

03:25.455 --> 03:26.664
Need help?

03:26.748 --> 03:29.000
Not for now. I'll let you know when I do.

03:31.544 --> 03:32.378
Hey!

03:33.713 --> 03:37.550
Miss, miss, can I get a kiss, kiss?

03:37.634 --> 03:39.677
Shut that off.
Sounds like a stupid ringtone.

03:39.761 --> 03:40.595
You're mean.

03:41.930 --> 03:45.433
I'm not a pervert

03:45.516 --> 03:48.269
What's wrong with you? It's our song.

03:48.353 --> 03:50.813
Why? Will you defend me from bashers?

03:50.897 --> 03:54.150
Will you even allow it
if I write songs like that?

03:57.278 --> 04:01.616
I won't defend you
but I won't hold it against you.

04:01.699 --> 04:02.533
Right?

04:04.410 --> 04:07.163
Give me a kiss, kiss!

04:08.581 --> 04:09.958
You're not helping.

04:10.708 --> 04:13.044
I can't even finish this song.

04:13.127 --> 04:14.462
I can't get the words out.

04:14.545 --> 04:18.132
I told Will I'll have
it ready when we get home.

04:19.300 --> 04:23.888
Hey, you'd better not be writing
that song while we're having sex.

04:27.892 --> 04:29.269
What's the matter with you?

04:29.978 --> 04:30.937
What do you mean?

04:31.771 --> 04:32.605
Why is it

04:34.148 --> 04:36.734
you're still cute
even when you're annoying?

04:37.777 --> 04:39.529
She liked that.

04:39.612 --> 04:41.823
-So what?
-You liked that.

04:41.906 --> 04:44.200
No, come on--

04:45.743 --> 04:48.371
Don't post that.
I hate it when you keep doing that.

04:48.454 --> 04:49.831
It's done. It's posted.

04:50.832 --> 04:55.003
#YOURSFOREVER, I LOVE YOU ISABELLA
MRS. CRUZ, #PERFECTWIFE, THIS IS IT!

04:55.086 --> 04:57.630
The engine might get too cold.

04:57.714 --> 05:00.049
We won't have a ride home
if it doesn't start.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.969
Don't be so mean to my Scarlet.
You'll upset her.

05:03.052 --> 05:05.513
I've known her far longer than you.

05:05.596 --> 05:06.848
Is that so?

05:07.390 --> 05:10.226
Then you should have
married Scarlet instead.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.352
Why did you pick me?

05:11.436 --> 05:13.104
-Is that what you want?
-Don't be jealous.

05:13.187 --> 05:16.524
-Yeah, take her to the boat with you.
-Why is your bag so heavy?

05:16.607 --> 05:17.442
Wait for me.

05:17.525 --> 05:19.694
-Help me with the video, please.
-For what?

05:19.777 --> 05:23.614
I just need to promote
Travel City luggage. Please?

05:26.909 --> 05:29.120
And we're here in Camarines Sur.

05:29.203 --> 05:33.041
And of course, I'm with my--

05:33.833 --> 05:36.210
-Hi!
-It's our honeymoon.

05:39.422 --> 05:45.720
And on our honeymoon, we can't possibly
be without Travel City luggage.

05:45.803 --> 05:48.890
It's super light.
It takes no effort to carry.

05:48.973 --> 05:51.851
And I'm sure
you can throw anything in there,

05:51.934 --> 05:54.937
and all your stuff would be safe.

05:57.231 --> 05:58.232
Fuck--

06:01.402 --> 06:02.236
Hello, what?

06:02.320 --> 06:04.447
Hey, fuckhead.
I'm calling about your song.

06:04.530 --> 06:07.992
Just 'cause you're on your honeymoon,
doesn't mean I'll let you off the hook.

06:08.076 --> 06:10.203
Is that all? Okay, okay.

06:10.912 --> 06:14.248
Not so fast, shithead.

06:14.332 --> 06:16.501
The studio's already booked
for when you get back.

06:16.584 --> 06:18.044
What if I want to extend?

06:18.127 --> 06:21.422
Extend? Are you fucking crazy?
You asshole.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.257
Hi, Will.

06:23.341 --> 06:25.426
-Hey, Billie!
-Hi, Will.

06:25.510 --> 06:27.178
What do you need from my husband?

06:27.637 --> 06:29.055
How's the honeymoon?

06:30.389 --> 06:32.600
It was going well until you called.

06:32.683 --> 06:34.560
I was just checking in on you guys.

06:35.103 --> 06:38.189
Didn't I tell you not to call
if it's not an emergency?

06:38.272 --> 06:39.398
Is there an emergency?

06:39.482 --> 06:43.027
Nothing at all. Just work stuff.
Enjoy your honeymoon.

06:46.823 --> 06:49.909
-What does he want?
-Just following up on the song.

06:50.451 --> 06:51.285
Wait.

06:54.122 --> 06:56.415
I'll just go on live for Travel City.

06:57.041 --> 06:58.042
Okay.

06:59.710 --> 07:00.628
Okay.

07:10.304 --> 07:11.639
I'm camera-shy.

07:11.722 --> 07:14.517
And we're here at Panglao Island!

07:14.600 --> 07:18.771
With me, ladies and gentlemen,
the one and only, Mrs. Jose Emilio Cruz!

07:20.440 --> 07:23.568
-How many times will you kiss me?
-Don't be shy, let them see you.

07:23.651 --> 07:25.194
Okay. Hi! Hi!

07:25.278 --> 07:28.573
And on our honeymoon, we can't
possibly be without Travel City bags.

07:28.656 --> 07:32.869
It keeps all your stuff
safe and secure, my friends.

07:32.952 --> 07:36.330
Thanks to Travel City,
our honeymoon will be stress-free.

07:36.414 --> 07:37.457
Hello.

07:42.503 --> 07:43.337
He's our guide.

07:45.131 --> 07:45.965
Aren't you…

07:46.674 --> 07:47.675
Aren't you a singer?

07:49.385 --> 07:50.511
Please call me Jecs.

07:50.595 --> 07:52.221
I'm Jecs. This is my wife.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.015
Hi. Nice to meet you.

07:54.974 --> 07:58.436
I'm Francis.
I'm the caretaker of Panglao Island.

08:00.396 --> 08:01.898
The boat's here. We can go.

08:02.940 --> 08:04.984
Quick favor,
can you lift the sign a bit higher?

08:05.067 --> 08:06.110
Sure, sir.

08:06.652 --> 08:10.156
See that, guys? Feels good, doesn't it?

08:10.239 --> 08:11.365
Right? Right, love?

08:11.949 --> 08:13.284
Sure, love. Let's just go.

08:13.367 --> 08:14.368
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

08:15.286 --> 08:17.163
Let me carry your luggage.

08:17.246 --> 08:20.458
Hi, guys! Yes, Panglao Island is gorgeous.

08:20.541 --> 08:22.043
Just like my wife.

08:22.126 --> 08:24.170
-Is it live? Hi!
-Damn.

08:24.837 --> 08:27.840
Okay, guys. Shoutout to Will, my manager.

08:27.924 --> 08:29.926
Take care of yourself there, buddy.

08:31.594 --> 08:35.640
I'm losing my signal so if you guys
want to watch my livestream,

08:35.723 --> 08:38.935
and you want to know when,
click the notification bell.

08:39.018 --> 08:44.106
Follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram,
and of course, on YouTube.

08:44.190 --> 08:46.692
Thank you very much!

08:47.318 --> 08:50.613
Sir! There it is.

08:51.864 --> 08:53.032
There it is!

08:53.115 --> 08:55.576
There it is. It's beautiful.

08:55.660 --> 08:57.245
I'm sure you'll like it, miss!

09:01.374 --> 09:03.876
-How many followers do I have?
-Let me see.

09:04.919 --> 09:07.088
You'll gain more, don't worry.

09:07.588 --> 09:11.801
You mentioned all the platforms.
Did you forget anything?

09:11.884 --> 09:14.136
-Are there other platforms?
-That's all of it.

09:15.429 --> 09:18.266
Great, now can you focus on me?
It's our honeymoon.

09:18.349 --> 09:19.517
Sure thing.

09:19.600 --> 09:22.019
"Sure thing"? Is it that hard?

09:29.569 --> 09:31.862
Welcome to Panglao Island.

09:32.280 --> 09:34.031
-Oh, my god, it's so pretty.
-Solid.

09:34.115 --> 09:37.285
You're lucky.
There are no other visitors on the island.

09:37.368 --> 09:38.452
-Really?
-Yeah!

09:38.995 --> 09:40.705
You have it all to yourselves.

09:40.788 --> 09:44.500
-What?
-We'll have some alone time.

09:46.294 --> 09:47.962
There it is, Panglao Island.

09:48.045 --> 09:49.672
-Panglao Island.
-Panglao Island.

09:51.132 --> 09:53.384
-Welcome!
-Travel City Luggage sure is worth it.

09:53.467 --> 09:56.429
There you go again.
Just take a picture before we leave, okay?

09:57.054 --> 10:00.182
Okay, we're going up on these…

10:01.392 --> 10:02.351
steps.

10:03.519 --> 10:05.396
I think there are 300 steps.

10:06.105 --> 10:09.775
Francis, you sure you don't need help?

10:09.859 --> 10:11.235
This is nothing, ma'am.

10:11.319 --> 10:12.153
You sure?

10:12.236 --> 10:13.362
It's hot today!

10:13.446 --> 10:14.280
Yes, ma'am.

10:14.822 --> 10:15.823
But no worries.

10:16.324 --> 10:17.158
Wow…

10:17.700 --> 10:20.077
We'll get there soon enough.

10:20.161 --> 10:22.079
You have the island all to yourselves.

10:22.163 --> 10:24.290
What do you say? He says we're alone here.

10:24.373 --> 10:26.500
We're pretty lucky.

10:27.752 --> 10:29.337
Great timing. Nice.

10:31.505 --> 10:32.340
We're here.

10:38.387 --> 10:40.556
Welcome to Panglao Island.

10:40.640 --> 10:41.641
Check it out.

10:48.564 --> 10:51.776
Still moving toward
the Philippine Area of Responsibility

10:51.859 --> 10:53.694
the low pressure area monitored by--

10:53.778 --> 10:55.279
I'll leave my shoes outside.

10:55.363 --> 10:57.031
Why are you watching on this TV?

10:57.114 --> 10:59.033
I just wanted to watch the news.

10:59.116 --> 11:01.202
-The news.
-Hello. My name is Billie.

11:01.285 --> 11:05.373
Billie! Good morning.
Welcome to Panglao Island.

11:05.456 --> 11:07.208
-It's so pretty.
-Thank you.

11:07.291 --> 11:11.962
This is Gina, my wife.
We're the caretakers of Panglao Island.

11:15.466 --> 11:17.385
Welcome to Panglao Island.

11:17.468 --> 11:18.386
It's so pretty.

11:18.469 --> 11:21.180
That's a beautiful plant.

11:21.263 --> 11:24.141
I bought it on the way.
I heard it's easy to take care of.

11:24.225 --> 11:28.604
Yes, that's true.
It really is easy to take care of it.

11:28.687 --> 11:30.231
That plant is just like me.

11:30.314 --> 11:31.273
Sorry?

11:31.357 --> 11:34.360
Yes! I'm just like that plant.

11:34.860 --> 11:37.822
You see,
I survive just fine without being watered.

11:38.948 --> 11:41.784
-What are you talking about?
-Love, get in here.

11:44.453 --> 11:45.413
Nice.

11:45.913 --> 11:47.706
Please have some refreshments.

11:47.790 --> 11:51.544
Sir, this is my wife, Gina.

11:52.169 --> 11:53.003
Hello.

11:53.587 --> 11:55.005
Hello, sir.

11:55.506 --> 11:58.259
Aren't you that singer?

11:58.342 --> 11:59.176
Yes.

11:59.260 --> 12:02.054
I know you. You're the singer of--

12:02.138 --> 12:09.103
What if tomorrow won't be the same?

12:09.395 --> 12:12.606
Sir, let's take a picture!
Hey. Take a picture of us.

12:12.690 --> 12:14.984
-I'm busy.
-Hurry up!

12:15.067 --> 12:17.611
-Sir, is it okay?
-Yeah, I'm coming. Hang on.

12:17.695 --> 12:20.322
-Gina, it's okay.
-No. I'm all sweaty.

12:20.406 --> 12:21.907
That's okay. Look here.

12:21.991 --> 12:22.867
There we go.

12:22.950 --> 12:24.493
-Thank you, ma'am.
-One, two, three!

12:24.577 --> 12:26.162
-Okay, here.
-Take it with our phone.

12:26.245 --> 12:27.079
Here.

12:28.956 --> 12:30.958
There. One more time.

12:31.041 --> 12:32.668
We got it.

12:35.087 --> 12:36.338
Sir, sorry about that.

12:36.422 --> 12:39.175
My wife's your number one fan.

12:39.925 --> 12:45.347
When we sing on the karaoke,
she always sings your song.

12:45.431 --> 12:46.265
"What If?"

12:46.348 --> 12:52.313
You know, I always get
100 points when I sing that song.

12:52.396 --> 12:54.607
I swear! Sir, do you have other songs?

12:54.690 --> 12:57.860
So I can sing them back to back
next time on the karaoke.

12:57.943 --> 12:59.778
There's one called "Heartbeat."

13:01.906 --> 13:02.823
Was that a hit?

13:12.833 --> 13:16.462
By the way, tomorrow at 6:00 a.m.,

13:17.713 --> 13:19.965
we're gonna go island hopping.

13:20.049 --> 13:21.509
-I love that.
-Nice. Let's do it.

13:21.592 --> 13:23.302
-I'm so down for that.
-Island hopping.

13:23.385 --> 13:29.141
Ma'am, sir, we live right over there.
You can see our house from here.

13:29.225 --> 13:34.939
So, if you ever need anything,
you can come right over.

13:35.523 --> 13:37.358
If you need help with cooking,

13:37.441 --> 13:40.694
since there's plenty of fresh fish
caught around here.

13:40.778 --> 13:43.405
Just call me. I can do that for you, okay?

13:43.489 --> 13:46.075
Okay, that's enough.
They probably want to rest now.

13:46.158 --> 13:48.035
-I know that!
-Okay, let's go.

13:48.118 --> 13:51.580
Thank you so much.
Enjoy your stay, ma'am, sir!

13:52.873 --> 13:53.707
So…

13:53.791 --> 13:55.834
-So? It's worth it, right?
-Worth it.

13:57.169 --> 13:58.337
That's something.

13:58.420 --> 14:00.172
-Yeah, exactly.
-Yeah.

14:00.256 --> 14:01.090
Yeah.

15:26.342 --> 15:28.844
Ella keeps liking your posts.

15:29.345 --> 15:30.763
-Where?
-Right there.

15:32.056 --> 15:34.224
Ella. Ella.

15:35.476 --> 15:37.853
-Ella.
-Yeah. That's nothing.

15:37.937 --> 15:41.148
She's trying to get your attention.
She's raining likes on you.

15:41.231 --> 15:42.566
She just likes doing that.

15:42.650 --> 15:44.985
Sure, but she didn't
like our wedding photo.

15:45.069 --> 15:46.779
No… It's just…

15:47.446 --> 15:48.280
What?

15:48.906 --> 15:53.243
She's just nice to me
because I went to her show.

15:55.913 --> 15:57.247
What's with that reaction?

15:58.457 --> 15:59.541
She's into you.

16:01.835 --> 16:02.795
So?

16:02.878 --> 16:05.089
She's not my type.

16:05.172 --> 16:06.882
You tried to get with her before.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.300
She's not my type.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.763
What if she gets naked in front of you?

16:14.640 --> 16:15.849
I'll close my eyes.

16:15.933 --> 16:17.059
Wow.

16:18.644 --> 16:19.478
Yeah.

16:20.062 --> 16:21.355
But if you get naked--

16:23.524 --> 16:24.984
-Hold that thought.
-What now?

16:26.527 --> 16:27.361
It's mama.

16:28.862 --> 16:29.780
Hello, Ma?

16:29.863 --> 16:31.907
I can't watch YouTube.

16:32.449 --> 16:35.035
I think my phone is broken.

16:35.119 --> 16:35.953
Broken?

16:36.578 --> 16:41.250
No, it's the… You know this,
the one with the password.

16:41.333 --> 16:43.002
It's 0-6-2-1, Ma. Your birthday.

16:43.085 --> 16:46.130
That's it. I knew it.

16:47.589 --> 16:50.843
By the way, Jecs,
we need to pay the electricity bill.

16:52.094 --> 16:53.887
I already gave it to Dianne, Ma.

16:54.680 --> 16:55.514
Did you?

16:56.056 --> 16:58.767
For my maintenance meds, too?

16:58.851 --> 17:01.645
Yeah, and for your groceries, too, Ma.

17:01.729 --> 17:03.147
Didn't she tell you?

17:03.230 --> 17:07.943
We barely see each other.
She goes straight to bed after work.

17:08.027 --> 17:11.488
I wouldn't want to wake her up, you know.

17:11.989 --> 17:14.366
Her shift starts past midnight, poor girl.

17:14.450 --> 17:17.036
I'm just glad you picked up
even while you're there.

17:17.119 --> 17:20.205
Okay. If there's nothing else, Ma,
I should go. Bye.

17:20.289 --> 17:22.291
Hey, wait.

17:22.916 --> 17:24.084
What now?

17:24.877 --> 17:29.048
Don't come back here
without my grandchild, okay?

17:30.966 --> 17:32.551
Okay, sure, Ma. I got it.

17:34.803 --> 17:36.263
All right, bye.

17:37.723 --> 17:39.600
-Give me your phone.
-Why?

17:40.142 --> 17:41.351
I'll show you something.

17:42.895 --> 17:43.771
You know what,

17:44.438 --> 17:46.565
if you get naked in front of me…

17:49.985 --> 17:50.986
I'm not like that!

17:51.070 --> 17:52.863
-What's wrong?
-It wasn't like that!

17:52.946 --> 17:55.657
It's my honeymoon. Yeah, how are you?

17:55.741 --> 17:58.243
I don't give a shit about Billie,
to be honest.

17:59.620 --> 18:01.538
Yeah, who cares if she's butt naked.

18:03.749 --> 18:05.292
I hate you so much.

18:21.183 --> 18:22.059
You excited?

18:22.643 --> 18:23.560
Are you asking me?

18:25.479 --> 18:28.607
-What are we supposed to do on an island?
-Don't start with me.

18:30.317 --> 18:31.944
Sir! Coffee!

18:32.027 --> 18:32.861
Yes, thank you!

18:32.945 --> 18:34.488
Hi! Thanks for the offer.

18:35.405 --> 18:36.448
Wait. Who's this?

18:37.866 --> 18:39.201
It's Hannah. Hold on.

18:39.284 --> 18:40.244
Okay, I'll be here.

18:43.872 --> 18:45.541
How's the trip?

18:46.625 --> 18:47.501
Good.

18:48.794 --> 18:50.254
We're going island hopping.

18:51.004 --> 18:52.965
Gosh, I'm so jealous.

18:53.966 --> 18:54.842
Good job.

18:54.925 --> 18:57.469
Oh, right. Your dad called.

18:57.553 --> 19:01.348
He said he's been trying to reach you
since last night. You're not picking up.

19:05.936 --> 19:09.731
He didn't even make the effort
to go to my wedding. Who does that?

19:09.815 --> 19:12.276
I know. I get it. I get it. Because…

19:13.277 --> 19:16.363
You're still angry.
What do I say when he calls again?

19:16.446 --> 19:18.949
Nothing. Tell him it's too late and…

19:19.032 --> 19:21.869
I'm supposed to be on my honeymoon.

19:22.870 --> 19:27.124
Honestly, I don't blame you.
Uncle's always been like that.

19:27.207 --> 19:31.044
It's just sad 'cause your mom
couldn't fly home from Canada

19:31.128 --> 19:34.173
for your wedding and now
you have this quarrel with your dad.

19:34.798 --> 19:37.259
Right? Hang on. You…

19:37.342 --> 19:39.261
Wait, hello? I'll call you back, okay?

19:39.344 --> 19:42.848
I still need to cook.
I've got tons to do. It's such a mess…

19:42.931 --> 19:45.017
I gotta go. Call you later. Bye.

19:45.100 --> 19:45.934
Bye.

19:50.647 --> 19:52.983
Daddy's now pestering Hannah.

19:54.234 --> 19:56.069
Why don't you just call or text him?

19:56.153 --> 20:00.866
Why would I?
I won't talk to him till he apologizes.

20:00.949 --> 20:02.326
What's this on your face?

20:02.409 --> 20:03.327
Okay.

20:03.410 --> 20:06.538
-Can we try to be happy on our honeymoon?
-Okay.

21:17.484 --> 21:19.820
-Is it cooked?
-Almost, sir.

21:19.903 --> 21:22.531
-Really?
-Yes, sir. It won't be long now.

21:23.031 --> 21:26.076
Ma'am, need more firewood?

21:26.159 --> 21:27.536
This should be enough, Francis.

21:27.619 --> 21:28.453
It's just right.

21:28.996 --> 21:29.830
All right.

21:31.415 --> 21:32.457
Look at you.

21:33.083 --> 21:34.876
-Deluxe service.
-Why, of course!

21:34.960 --> 21:36.295
What do you need me to do?

21:36.378 --> 21:37.629
-Everything!
-Oh, no!

21:47.222 --> 21:48.640
You're so pretty, ma'am!

21:48.724 --> 21:49.766
Looking good, ma'am!

21:49.850 --> 21:51.393
Right? Like sour soup.

21:51.476 --> 21:52.602
I'm a lucky guy!

21:54.563 --> 21:55.605
I'll snap a photo.

21:56.106 --> 21:57.024
For real?

22:01.820 --> 22:02.988
-Wow!
-Wait!

22:03.905 --> 22:05.907
What about me, did I get lucky with you?

22:05.991 --> 22:07.701
Well, of course, damn you.

22:25.927 --> 22:26.762
I got it.

22:29.139 --> 22:30.307
Post it now.

22:30.390 --> 22:31.808
I'll do it later. I'm busy.

22:31.892 --> 22:34.269
-Just fucking do it now. Post it.
-Fine, fine.

22:34.352 --> 22:35.979
Did Caloy tell you?

22:36.063 --> 22:38.273
He won't make it
to your recording tomorrow.

22:38.356 --> 22:41.276
-It's his child's christening.
-Then find a replacement.

22:41.359 --> 22:42.194
Fuck Caloy.

22:42.277 --> 22:45.155
He knows we're on a tight
schedule for your album release.

22:45.238 --> 22:48.992
-I'm neck deep in problems.
-Excuse me. I need to do something.

22:54.331 --> 22:55.332
Hey! Billie.

22:55.916 --> 22:57.000
-Hey.
-How's it going?

22:57.084 --> 22:58.460
Will. What's up?

22:59.127 --> 23:01.922
Right on time. You're heaven sent.

23:02.005 --> 23:02.964
What's up?

23:03.715 --> 23:05.675
We're doing a session tomorrow.

23:06.176 --> 23:08.512
I need a keyboardist.
I was hoping you'd do it.

23:10.055 --> 23:11.056
For whom?

23:11.556 --> 23:13.183
For him. Jecs.

23:13.683 --> 23:17.354
My new artist, the one you're hearing.
It's his debut album, so…

23:19.689 --> 23:21.483
And this dude deserves an album?

23:21.566 --> 23:22.442
Not bad.

23:22.901 --> 23:24.319
-Why?
-Oh, shit.

23:26.404 --> 23:27.239
Jecs…

23:28.156 --> 23:32.327
Congrats. I heard "What Is?"
got tons of airplay.

23:32.410 --> 23:33.495
"What If?"

23:33.578 --> 23:35.330
What… "What If?" Yes.

23:36.373 --> 23:38.083
Jecs, this is Billie.

23:41.211 --> 23:42.462
Hey, she's good.

23:42.546 --> 23:45.298
What else can you expect
from Enrico Neri's daughter?

23:46.550 --> 23:48.468
That's why you've got high standards.

23:48.552 --> 23:49.511
Don't be a jerk.

23:50.011 --> 23:51.763
So, Billie. Are you good for tomorrow?

23:51.847 --> 23:54.391
If you aren't busy, it's good money.
A gig is a gig.

23:57.144 --> 23:59.271
-Yeah, I'm not busy tomorrow. Sure.
-All right!

23:59.354 --> 24:03.275
It seems you don't want to do it.
I don't think you like my songs.

24:03.358 --> 24:04.609
Don't be silly.

24:04.693 --> 24:05.569
No!

24:06.111 --> 24:07.863
I can lower my standards for you.

24:08.947 --> 24:10.448
-See you tomorrow.
-All right.

24:10.532 --> 24:12.117
-Text me. Thank you.
-I'll text.

24:15.078 --> 24:16.413
Yeah, take care.

24:18.165 --> 24:18.999
She's great.

24:20.500 --> 24:22.419
You asshole, she's out of your league.

24:22.878 --> 24:25.005
I told you, she's Enrico Neri's daughter.

24:44.232 --> 24:48.653
You said I should find another
Since there are others out there

24:49.696 --> 24:54.367
In my mind
There's nothing else to look for

24:55.493 --> 24:59.915
Even when you're not with me
I smile at the thought of you

25:01.082 --> 25:05.837
When you're in front of me
The world stops revolving

25:06.338 --> 25:07.297
I wish…

25:07.380 --> 25:08.215
Will.

25:10.217 --> 25:11.635
Take five, please.

25:11.718 --> 25:12.886
Okay, guys. Take five.

25:21.603 --> 25:23.521
-Let's smoke outside?
-Did you like it?

25:24.981 --> 25:25.857
It's okay.

25:30.445 --> 25:31.863
Just "okay"?

25:36.743 --> 25:39.204
Want my honest opinion?

25:41.164 --> 25:42.499
Do I have a choice?

25:48.546 --> 25:50.215
It's okay,

25:50.298 --> 25:56.263
but from what I can hear, I feel like,

25:57.055 --> 26:01.518
the general feel of the song is…

26:02.227 --> 26:04.187
This is just based on what I'm hearing.

26:04.271 --> 26:06.231
It sounds like "What If?"

26:09.609 --> 26:13.822
Yeah. It's okay, but it's like,
you just recycled your stuff.

26:20.120 --> 26:22.622
Sorry. You said you wanted honesty.

26:22.706 --> 26:25.542
It's fine, though. In general.

26:27.919 --> 26:31.298
I did want to hear the truth
but I didn't expect that…

26:32.590 --> 26:33.550
it would hurt.

26:38.138 --> 26:39.097
Will.

26:39.180 --> 26:42.225
Can we reschedule the recording?

26:42.726 --> 26:43.768
What the fuck. Why?

26:43.852 --> 26:45.937
-I just need to fix something.
-Excuse me.

26:49.691 --> 26:51.067
Billie, is there a problem?

26:54.195 --> 26:58.825
The world stops when I see you

26:58.908 --> 27:03.288
If only you could feel

27:04.247 --> 27:09.669
The way my heart beats

27:09.753 --> 27:14.049
When I'm with you

27:14.883 --> 27:20.305
Should I keep these feelings hidden?

27:22.223 --> 27:24.142
It's beautiful. It really is.

27:25.685 --> 27:27.687
Why don't we write a song and do a duet?

27:28.146 --> 27:28.980
Me?

27:29.481 --> 27:30.565
I'm not a singer.

27:31.983 --> 27:32.859
No, really.

27:33.777 --> 27:34.986
Besides…

27:35.528 --> 27:36.654
Besides what?

27:39.240 --> 27:40.825
Never mind, you'll think it's cheesy.

27:41.659 --> 27:43.453
I'll lower my standards for you.

27:48.124 --> 27:50.418
I don't know, maybe I'm just not into it.

27:50.502 --> 27:54.881
Singing, for me… it's very personal.

27:55.632 --> 27:59.260
Even if it's just a gig,
I don't think I can do it.

27:59.344 --> 28:04.766
So if I ever do it one day,
it has to be with someone…

28:07.310 --> 28:10.146
it has to be for something meaningful.

28:14.776 --> 28:17.362
See, I told you it's cheesy.

28:18.196 --> 28:19.030
Okay, fine.

28:21.366 --> 28:25.954
Okay, I criticize a lot
so I'm scared of also getting criticized.

28:26.037 --> 28:26.955
So, never mind.

28:28.915 --> 28:30.500
Why aren't you saying anything?

28:30.792 --> 28:31.876
You're so…

28:33.628 --> 28:38.383
You said I should find another
Since there are others out there

28:39.801 --> 28:44.723
In my mind
There's nothing else to look for

28:45.807 --> 28:51.271
Even when you're not with me
I smile at the thought of you

28:51.896 --> 28:57.193
When you're in front of me
The world stops revolving

28:57.777 --> 29:01.865
I wish you knew

29:02.949 --> 29:09.080
How my heart beats differently

29:09.164 --> 29:13.752
Whenever I'm with you

29:15.086 --> 29:22.051
Should I hide how hard I'm falling?

29:34.564 --> 29:39.527
The way you carry me
Makes me forget my heaviness

29:40.653 --> 29:45.658
You are the breath of my heart

29:46.701 --> 29:51.748
I just want to kiss you

29:52.707 --> 29:57.796
I wish you'd know, my love

29:58.546 --> 30:01.925
I wish you knew

30:03.718 --> 30:09.891
How my heart beats differently

30:09.974 --> 30:14.562
Whenever I'm with you

30:15.814 --> 30:22.779
Should I hide how hard I'm falling?

30:28.326 --> 30:29.661
Where are you looking?

30:31.621 --> 30:33.581
Damn it, we have another hit!

30:33.665 --> 30:34.874
-It's so good.
-Nice!

30:36.960 --> 30:38.711
-Nice, dude.
-That was sick, Billie.

30:38.795 --> 30:41.798
-Love your style, Billie.
-That wasn't me. It was all you guys.

30:41.881 --> 30:43.341
Where'd you get that…

30:45.134 --> 30:46.386
It's all from your song.

30:46.469 --> 30:47.554
-Really?
-For real.

30:48.054 --> 30:49.347
You're really something, Billie.

30:51.724 --> 30:52.851
Sir.

30:54.435 --> 30:55.270
Sir.

30:56.646 --> 30:58.648
-Thank you.
-You're welcome, sir.

30:58.731 --> 31:00.024
Thanks a lot.

31:01.693 --> 31:02.527
Sir.

31:03.152 --> 31:04.696
That's a cool phone.

31:05.697 --> 31:08.157
-Do you play Mobile Legends?
-No, I'm not a gamer.

31:08.241 --> 31:09.826
That's a shame.

31:09.909 --> 31:13.288
You have a cool phone
and you don't use it.

31:13.788 --> 31:17.750
Hey. What, you're envious?

31:19.168 --> 31:20.086
Hey!

31:20.169 --> 31:25.300
That's because he does nothing
but be on his phone, sir.

31:25.383 --> 31:27.844
He takes it with him even in bed.

31:28.344 --> 31:32.682
Cut it out, Gina.
You're jealous of a cell phone.

31:32.765 --> 31:35.602
I'm not jealous, asshole.

31:35.685 --> 31:38.521
I'm right,
you're always playing those video games.

31:38.605 --> 31:43.067
You know, he's worse than his son.
He's addicted to that game, LM!

31:43.151 --> 31:44.736
-What's "LM"?
-LM!

31:44.819 --> 31:47.947
-If you're gonna scold me, know the facts.
-LM!

31:48.948 --> 31:53.077
It's ML. It's the only vice that I have.

31:53.161 --> 31:55.204
Would you rather I drank
or played video games?

31:55.705 --> 32:01.085
I want you to pull yourself together.
You spend all your money on mobile data.

32:01.586 --> 32:05.340
I'm not buying it,
I'm connecting to free WiFi.

32:05.423 --> 32:08.134
I swear, Gina. You guys are so cute.

32:08.217 --> 32:10.345
This is how we show our love.

32:10.428 --> 32:11.346
How's that going?

32:11.429 --> 32:14.057
-It's done. Try it.
-Sir, can I bum a cig?

32:14.140 --> 32:15.183
Sure thing.

32:15.266 --> 32:16.601
-Francis!
-A light, too.

32:17.101 --> 32:19.312
-No, it's okay.
-Have some shame!

32:19.395 --> 32:21.606
It's okay. It's no problem.

32:22.190 --> 32:23.024
Goodness!

32:23.524 --> 32:26.194
It's a guy thing.
They'll do what they want.

32:26.277 --> 32:27.820
You should be ashamed.

32:28.404 --> 32:30.740
But ma'am, you're so lucky.

32:30.823 --> 32:31.866
Why do you say that?

32:31.950 --> 32:34.035
Because you're able to experience this.

32:34.118 --> 32:36.079
Going on a honeymoon.

32:37.497 --> 32:40.708
What about you, Gina?
Where did you go for your honeymoon?

32:40.792 --> 32:41.834
Nowhere!

32:42.377 --> 32:44.796
I never experienced a honeymoon.

32:44.879 --> 32:47.131
I was pregnant when I got married.

32:47.215 --> 32:49.092
Francis is a sharp shooter.

32:49.175 --> 32:53.721
You know what happened?
One pop, straight to my baby oven.

32:53.805 --> 32:54.764
I got snagged!

33:03.690 --> 33:04.649
Francis!

33:04.732 --> 33:06.734
What, aren't you gonna help me?

33:06.818 --> 33:10.113
Yeah, coming. Jeez. I was about to play.

33:12.240 --> 33:13.449
Let's prepare the table.

33:41.644 --> 33:43.062
-Ma'am!
-Yes?

33:43.146 --> 33:46.482
You're a singer! You have a great voice.
Let's take a picture!

33:46.566 --> 33:48.484
-I want a picture with you.
-No.

33:48.568 --> 33:49.569
I'm not a singer.

33:49.652 --> 33:50.570
I love your voice.

33:50.653 --> 33:53.322
-Sir, she's a singer. She's denying it.
-No. Tell her.

33:53.406 --> 33:54.574
She really is a singer.

33:54.657 --> 33:57.535
But she doesn't want to be.
So, wifey? How about that duet?

33:57.618 --> 33:58.745
Come on! Do it! Do a duet!

33:58.828 --> 34:00.246
-I'll cheer for you!
-Please!

34:00.663 --> 34:01.706
Please!

34:48.878 --> 34:50.379
-Let's just dance?
-Francis, dance!

34:50.463 --> 34:51.464
I'll be your groove

34:51.547 --> 34:52.924
I'll pass, sir!

34:53.841 --> 34:54.759
This fool.

34:56.052 --> 34:57.762
I'll prepare the table. Let's eat!

35:16.447 --> 35:17.365
Wait.

35:19.992 --> 35:24.831
You're with me tonight

35:28.668 --> 35:33.923
Come here by my side

35:36.676 --> 35:37.552
Is that good?

35:38.928 --> 35:40.012
-Really?
-Yep.

35:49.856 --> 35:50.857
Still working?

35:51.774 --> 35:54.402
Yeah, gotta seize the moment.
I thought of something.

35:56.904 --> 35:58.406
I thought we were gonna…

35:59.574 --> 36:01.701
Wait, really? Right here?

36:02.827 --> 36:03.661
Forget it.

36:04.871 --> 36:06.747
You're busy, right?

36:06.831 --> 36:10.418
You've got to seize the moment.
Write your song…

36:11.294 --> 36:12.670
So seize your moment.

36:15.590 --> 36:19.093
Why did I even say it?

36:19.177 --> 36:22.346
Now I'm left hanging bone-hard

36:22.430 --> 36:28.603
Your fault for working on our honeymoon

36:30.479 --> 36:31.647
What do you want?

36:32.273 --> 36:39.238
Miss, miss, can I get a kiss, kiss?

36:40.281 --> 36:45.161
I can't take it anymore

36:45.244 --> 36:48.789
I'm not a pervert

36:48.873 --> 36:50.333
I'll record this. Wait.

36:52.293 --> 36:54.128
This is the extent of our honeymoon.

36:55.379 --> 36:58.341
This is as intimate
as we're ever gonna get.

36:58.424 --> 37:01.719
Miss, miss

37:01.802 --> 37:05.890
Can I get a kiss, kiss?

37:05.973 --> 37:10.228
I can't take it anymore

37:10.311 --> 37:15.233
I'm not a pervert!

37:15.816 --> 37:18.819
Miss, miss

37:18.903 --> 37:22.907
Can I get a kiss, kiss?

37:22.990 --> 37:25.785
I can't take it anymore…

37:28.079 --> 37:28.996
Good luck, bro.

37:30.873 --> 37:32.833
-Boys, are you ready?
-Anytime!

37:34.293 --> 37:35.127
Let's go!

37:41.425 --> 37:42.343
Is there a problem?

37:42.927 --> 37:43.844
Depends on you.

37:44.428 --> 37:45.304
What did I do?

37:47.640 --> 37:48.516
Hey!

37:49.517 --> 37:50.476
Are you sure?

37:52.478 --> 37:53.354
You sure?

37:55.356 --> 37:56.315
Isabella Neri…

37:57.149 --> 37:58.734
Say yes! Say yes!

38:02.196 --> 38:03.406
As long as you're sure.

38:03.489 --> 38:04.573
Isabel…

38:05.366 --> 38:06.242
You're sure?

38:07.201 --> 38:09.412
-Okay.
-Say yes!

38:09.996 --> 38:11.372
There it goes.

38:23.509 --> 38:24.468
Play it.

38:25.928 --> 38:26.804
Here, here.

38:26.887 --> 38:27.930
Take a video.

38:48.826 --> 38:52.288
Billie, I know it's cliché,
I know it's cheesy.

38:53.414 --> 38:55.082
But now, I can boldly say,

39:00.755 --> 39:02.381
And I promise you,

39:04.842 --> 39:06.802
starting now, you'll never be alone.

39:08.763 --> 39:13.934
Doesn't matter how hard
things get, I'm here for you.

39:43.047 --> 39:46.258
I know we're just setting out
on this journey,

39:52.973 --> 39:55.351
We'll discover so many things
about each other.

39:56.268 --> 39:58.646
And like what you said, all snot-faced,

40:22.044 --> 40:26.799
LOVE, DON'T LET ME GO EVEN THOUGH
I'M A JERK SOMETIMES - #YOURSFOREVER

40:37.476 --> 40:38.519
Okay, go.

40:43.399 --> 40:50.281
WIFEY AND OUR SMALL FAMILY

42:10.361 --> 42:11.195
Me, too.

42:11.904 --> 42:12.905
I like this.

42:15.491 --> 42:16.575
Just us, chilling.

42:17.660 --> 42:19.912
There's no content to think about,

42:20.538 --> 42:22.164
not thinking about my next song…

42:23.082 --> 42:26.168
Why don't you show these songs to Will?

42:27.711 --> 42:30.548
They're simple,
but there's space for improvement.

42:31.048 --> 42:32.383
It's not Will's style.

42:33.384 --> 42:35.302
He's got his own vibe, I've got mine.

42:37.596 --> 42:39.932
Can't you fight for
the things you really want?

42:40.683 --> 42:42.768
I could but then I'll lose my contract.

42:43.477 --> 42:45.938
Then what,
I'll go back to selling insurance?

42:47.481 --> 42:48.357
You could.

42:50.526 --> 42:51.986
But if you stop

42:52.778 --> 42:54.738
making songs,

42:56.574 --> 42:58.200
the whole universe would be sad.

42:59.618 --> 43:00.828
The whole universe?

43:01.537 --> 43:03.455
And your number one fan.

43:04.790 --> 43:06.417
If I stop, what happens to us?

43:07.585 --> 43:09.753
I won't have anything
to pay for our townhouse.

43:09.837 --> 43:11.672
A lot of years left on the mortgage.

43:17.177 --> 43:18.679
if we're out of options,

43:19.555 --> 43:24.268
we could move into one of the apartments
your family's renting out, right?

43:25.185 --> 43:26.020
Not really.

43:27.855 --> 43:28.731
I don't think so.

43:30.733 --> 43:33.360
Where will I source out
my monthly support for mama?

43:34.236 --> 43:36.614
I'm glad she put all my savings there.

43:36.697 --> 43:40.367
At least, I have another source of income.

43:41.243 --> 43:42.077
That's true.

43:44.038 --> 43:45.873
Before you used to get so many gigs.

43:46.540 --> 43:51.587
And you'd be abroad for so long.
I didn't see much of you.

43:53.714 --> 43:54.673
Did you miss me?

43:55.758 --> 43:58.552
So much!
I don't have anyone else to annoy!

44:41.387 --> 44:42.596
There really isn't.

44:58.320 --> 44:59.446
It's coming down hard.

45:06.578 --> 45:07.454
Love, careful.

45:14.378 --> 45:16.922
Ma'am, we'll do that.

45:17.005 --> 45:17.881
Okay!

45:17.965 --> 45:19.591
-Okay!
-We'll take care of it.

45:21.427 --> 45:22.428
Oh, gosh.

45:25.681 --> 45:27.141
Well, good morning, love.

45:34.648 --> 45:35.941
It's all wet.

45:36.024 --> 45:37.943
It must be the incoming typhoon.

45:38.527 --> 45:40.154
Is there a typhoon?

45:40.237 --> 45:42.865
Don't worry,
it's just a rain shower, ma'am.

45:42.948 --> 45:44.825
Don't go scaring them with a typhoon.

45:45.367 --> 45:50.247
No, I watched it
on the weather news on TV.

45:53.167 --> 45:54.501
Did it get wet, love?

45:55.294 --> 45:56.628
-You okay?
-It's wet.

45:57.129 --> 45:59.089
-Is it my fault?
-It's your lips' fault.

46:05.429 --> 46:07.222
-Love, let me wash those for you.
-Yes?

46:07.306 --> 46:09.141
In your dreams. Hang these up.

46:18.192 --> 46:19.526
Thanks.

46:35.000 --> 46:39.046
It's pouring out there!
The street's flooded.

46:39.129 --> 46:41.048
It's raining here, too. How are you guys?

46:41.131 --> 46:42.174
We're okay.

46:42.257 --> 46:46.887
I called because your Aunt Rita
told me about this dragon oil.

46:46.970 --> 46:48.305
Helps you to get pregnant.

46:48.388 --> 46:49.223
For you?

46:50.140 --> 46:52.851
No? Don't be silly.

46:53.685 --> 46:55.062
For Billie.

46:55.604 --> 46:58.941
I opened up a bit about her condition.

46:59.024 --> 47:00.692
Ma, why did you tell her?

47:01.485 --> 47:02.694
Why not?

47:03.195 --> 47:05.322
Your Aunt Rita is family.

47:05.405 --> 47:09.660
Besides, dragon oil's
a harmless herbal oil, isn't it?

47:09.743 --> 47:10.577
Ma…

47:11.161 --> 47:14.706
Let it go. Just tell Billie.
I've got it here.

47:38.438 --> 47:41.817
Here, have some of the beef soup I cooked.

47:41.900 --> 47:43.694
You'll love this, for sure.

47:43.777 --> 47:46.738
I let it stew for three hours.
Meat's falling off the bones.

47:47.698 --> 47:48.699
Thank you, Gina.

47:49.700 --> 47:53.161
Ma'am, you're absolutely blooming.

47:54.121 --> 47:56.873
Your child will have
the prettiest face I'm sure.

47:58.208 --> 48:00.961
Both of you have got handsome faces.

48:01.044 --> 48:02.045
Gina!

48:02.129 --> 48:03.130
What's the problem?

48:03.213 --> 48:06.341
You make babies when
you're on a honeymoon, right?

48:07.676 --> 48:09.886
Would you like me to get you some bowls?

48:12.848 --> 48:14.766
Gina… Maybe later.

48:19.980 --> 48:25.027
If you don't feel like eating yet,
I'll come back later.

48:28.405 --> 48:29.239
Got it.

48:29.990 --> 48:31.199
All right, thank you.

48:32.242 --> 48:33.076
Come on!

48:58.852 --> 49:00.228
Mama was just joking.

49:03.148 --> 49:04.107
Oh, my God.

49:05.067 --> 49:07.110
Is it still a joke to you?

49:07.194 --> 49:10.697
Or don't you get it because you're not
the one they're gossiping about?

49:11.198 --> 49:12.991
It's only my aunt.

49:13.075 --> 49:14.368
Yeah, but that's the thing.

49:14.451 --> 49:17.871
Now there are two other people
making decisions about my body.

49:17.954 --> 49:20.874
I know that.
That's why I told her to stop, didn't I?

49:20.957 --> 49:23.502
Yes, but I don't think
you explained it well enough

49:23.585 --> 49:26.963
because she still doesn't understand
that we already had a deal.

49:27.047 --> 49:28.340
Because it's hard.

49:30.592 --> 49:33.804
I don't think my mom believes

49:33.887 --> 49:36.014
that us not having a child
is fine with me.

49:40.644 --> 49:42.479
Once we move to the townhouse,

49:42.562 --> 49:45.982
why don't you move your shop online
instead of setting up at bazaars?

49:47.067 --> 49:50.821
I don't want that. I prefer the bazaars.
I interact with humans.

49:51.571 --> 49:55.200
Or make music again.
Why don't you ask your father for help?

49:55.283 --> 49:56.785
Ask Enrico Neri for help?

50:00.747 --> 50:02.666
No. Not worth it.

50:03.375 --> 50:07.754
Every time we talk, he'd always
remind me I owe him this condo.

50:07.838 --> 50:10.799
"You should be thankful
I bought you a roof over your head."

50:10.882 --> 50:13.343
If I ask him for help
with anything music related,

50:14.094 --> 50:16.847
I'll never hear the end of it.

50:17.848 --> 50:18.807
Well…

50:19.516 --> 50:20.851
It would be great, though.

50:23.645 --> 50:24.604
Okay.

50:25.272 --> 50:26.148
Forget about it.

50:26.231 --> 50:28.900
I don't want to hear any
more swearing directed at me.

50:29.526 --> 50:32.696
You know how I get rattled
whenever somebody says a bad word.

50:32.779 --> 50:33.613
I know.

50:38.535 --> 50:39.911
It's ironic, though, right?

50:40.370 --> 50:42.539
Everyone thinks
he's this excellent, kind man.

50:42.622 --> 50:47.836
But when it comes to me,
he's anything but.

50:53.508 --> 50:56.720
I want to think it's just
normal for parents to be like that,

50:58.013 --> 51:00.015
but when I remember what you told me

51:02.017 --> 51:03.977
about what he said when you were a kid.

51:04.728 --> 51:07.564
"To learn how to swim,
you should be thrown into the water."

51:07.647 --> 51:08.690
That's hardcore.

51:08.774 --> 51:10.150
That's not the worst of it.

51:10.650 --> 51:12.444
But I did learn how to swim.

51:13.153 --> 51:14.738
You didn't tell anyone?

51:15.781 --> 51:18.825
Who could I tell? My mother's in denial.

51:19.743 --> 51:23.288
Should I have said,
"Hello, guys! My father beats me"?

51:23.371 --> 51:24.331
How would that go?

51:24.998 --> 51:27.918
No, 'cause I was thinking,
when it's our turn to have children,

51:28.001 --> 51:29.836
I could never do anything like that.

51:59.699 --> 52:02.619
I don't think
you ever have to worry about that.

52:03.286 --> 52:04.162
What's this?

52:06.248 --> 52:07.958
You got checked? Are you pregnant?

52:09.042 --> 52:10.001
Sadly, no.

52:12.003 --> 52:12.921
I have…

52:19.803 --> 52:20.679
What's that?

52:21.721 --> 52:23.932
Cancer? Do you need surgery?

52:24.015 --> 52:25.392
When was your last checkup?

52:26.101 --> 52:27.811
Too many questions. One at a time.

52:27.894 --> 52:30.397
What's wrong? I don't understand.

52:30.480 --> 52:33.024
No, 'cause you know
I don't get my monthly periods?

52:33.108 --> 52:34.943
That's why you thought…

52:35.569 --> 52:37.863
But when I talked to Dr. Castillo,

52:38.613 --> 52:42.200
I'm not pregnant,
but she said there might be an issue.

52:42.701 --> 52:45.287
So that's her diagnosis.

52:46.204 --> 52:49.207
That I have premature ovarian failure.

52:55.547 --> 52:57.382
Just the name alone is depressing.

53:01.428 --> 53:02.596
I don't get it.

53:05.223 --> 53:09.144
I'm not clear on the details either
but I guess it's safe to say

53:09.895 --> 53:13.940
that my ovaries are a flop
and I might never bear children.

53:28.955 --> 53:30.582
Let's look for another doctor.

53:31.625 --> 53:33.418
Love, I've been to two doctors.

53:34.085 --> 53:35.545
Then let's find someone else.

53:35.629 --> 53:39.007
I don't want to.
They all say the same thing.

53:39.090 --> 53:41.801
Hormone therapy. I don't wanna do that.

53:42.719 --> 53:43.720
Why not?

53:44.554 --> 53:48.016
Because it's not 100% guaranteed anyway.

53:48.099 --> 53:51.186
And there's so many hoops to go through.
So many side effects.

53:51.645 --> 53:53.021
What if I can't handle it?

53:53.980 --> 53:54.814
Why?

53:54.898 --> 54:00.028
Wouldn't you be okay with us
just getting a puppy, or…

54:01.446 --> 54:02.656
a plant?

54:02.739 --> 54:04.574
At least we won't have a hard time.

54:04.658 --> 54:07.535
Come on, Billie. We can still try IVF.

54:08.036 --> 54:09.579
We can't possibly afford that.

54:09.913 --> 54:11.039
I'll save up for it.

54:12.207 --> 54:14.084
Don't, it's a waste of money.

54:14.834 --> 54:19.756
-And to be honest, I've made up my mind.
-Made up your mind about what?

54:20.382 --> 54:21.383
That if ever,

54:22.133 --> 54:25.303
I'm okay with
not being able to get pregnant.

54:25.387 --> 54:26.221
Hey.

54:26.930 --> 54:29.015
You don't get to decide that by yourself.

54:29.808 --> 54:30.642
Yes, right.

54:31.309 --> 54:33.895
So as early as now,
I'm giving you a chance.

54:33.979 --> 54:35.146
Would you like to

54:36.272 --> 54:40.026
put off the wedding,
so you can think things through?

54:40.110 --> 54:41.403
Where'd that come from?

54:42.404 --> 54:44.280
I don't want you to wait for nothing.

54:44.364 --> 54:46.241
And I don't want that either.

54:46.908 --> 54:50.286
So you don't want children,
and you don't want to get married?

54:50.787 --> 54:54.541
It's not that I don't want to.
But this is the body that was given to me.

54:54.624 --> 54:56.292
What can I do about it?

54:56.376 --> 54:59.129
You can do something.
You just don't want to try.

55:00.296 --> 55:04.759
I don't want to hurt you.
And I don't want to get hurt.

55:04.843 --> 55:06.469
Is there nothing more we can do?

55:08.471 --> 55:11.224
-There's one option.
-See? We do have options.

55:11.307 --> 55:14.144
-Have children with someone else.
-How did you jump that far?

55:14.227 --> 55:15.562
Now, don't get mad at me.

55:15.645 --> 55:18.023
I'm giving you a chance
to back out right now.

55:18.106 --> 55:19.816
At least you'll get what you want.

55:21.276 --> 55:22.944
We're getting married, aren't we?

55:28.950 --> 55:31.411
What other reason is there? I love you.

55:32.620 --> 55:34.289
That's why we're getting married.

56:14.829 --> 56:16.039
-Gina?
-Yeah?

56:19.459 --> 56:20.293
Hey!

56:25.381 --> 56:26.883
You tell Mr. Jecs.

56:28.051 --> 56:28.927
Go on.

56:30.011 --> 56:30.887
Tell him.

56:34.933 --> 56:35.767
Sir.

56:37.519 --> 56:38.353
Sir.

56:39.229 --> 56:40.063
Yes?

56:41.314 --> 56:43.274
Francis has something to say.

56:43.358 --> 56:44.192
Okay.

56:45.902 --> 56:46.736
Sir…

56:48.738 --> 56:53.701
Sir, with this weather
we can still go to town…

56:55.036 --> 56:59.249
We ran out of gas and I was thinking maybe
we can buy supplies while it's still safe?

56:59.958 --> 57:01.000
Sure.

57:03.169 --> 57:06.798
Here, can you get me some cigarettes?

57:08.883 --> 57:11.469
Sir, how about Ms. Billie?
She might want something?

57:11.553 --> 57:13.304
I think she's still asleep.

57:14.722 --> 57:16.099
-Okay.
-Okay, sir.

57:16.182 --> 57:17.016
Okay.

58:19.662 --> 58:20.497
I'm sorry.

58:22.207 --> 58:25.502
Mama meant nothing by it.
You know her, she just wants a grandchild.

58:26.044 --> 58:26.961
I know.

58:28.046 --> 58:29.672
But she doesn't get it.

58:30.465 --> 58:33.510
She doesn't, because she's not the one
I'm married to, right?

58:36.429 --> 58:39.015
Don't worry, I'll sit her down
next time we see each other.

58:39.098 --> 58:40.892
That I should've done much earlier.

58:45.271 --> 58:46.397
You're right as usual.

58:55.031 --> 58:55.907
It's Dad.

59:07.126 --> 59:09.379
Hey, don't answer it.

59:12.173 --> 59:13.758
Maybe he wants to say sorry.

59:14.926 --> 59:16.511
My dad, say sorry?

59:18.513 --> 59:20.974
You saw how he treated me. You were there.

59:39.284 --> 59:40.118
Sit down.

59:43.538 --> 59:44.747
You're early, sir.

59:54.257 --> 59:55.967
What would you like to drink, sir?

59:57.802 --> 59:58.636
Water's fine.

01:00:03.474 --> 01:00:04.434
Just water for you?

01:00:05.143 --> 01:00:08.646
Your Auntie Tessie
doesn't want me drinking anymore.

01:00:08.730 --> 01:00:09.731
Is she coming?

01:00:14.402 --> 01:00:16.571
I think she has a meeting with the Rotary.

01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:29.042
It's our third year anniversary…

01:00:29.125 --> 01:00:34.714
And we wanted to wait for everyone
but since you're asking--

01:00:34.797 --> 01:00:36.049
We're getting married.

01:00:42.639 --> 01:00:44.557
Just us and some close friends.

01:00:52.899 --> 01:00:54.025
So you can get a divorce.

01:00:54.609 --> 01:00:55.610
Are you serious?

01:00:56.277 --> 01:00:57.945
Daddy, that's really your advice?

01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:15.254
And I know not everyone
understands what's expected of us.

01:01:21.636 --> 01:01:25.056
Don't you think that's unfair
to Billie and to us, sir?

01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:38.486
Don't just assume
we'll end up like you and mommy.

01:01:45.284 --> 01:01:46.911
I don't even know what…

01:01:46.994 --> 01:01:49.956
Can you call it a career,
whatever it is you're doing right now?

01:01:50.039 --> 01:01:54.502
Musician? Online seller?
You even taught English to Koreans, right?

01:01:55.628 --> 01:01:57.672
At least, I survive.

01:02:00.633 --> 01:02:02.385
Your mom still sends you an allowance.

01:02:05.471 --> 01:02:07.056
I bought you a condo.

01:02:12.061 --> 01:02:13.771
I can support Billie well enough, sir.

01:02:35.001 --> 01:02:38.463
And that's all I ever hear from you,
everyday since I was young.

01:02:45.136 --> 01:02:48.306
Is this really how you
show your support, Daddy?

01:02:49.348 --> 01:02:52.185
I didn't come here to be scolded by you.

01:02:52.268 --> 01:02:53.436
You little bitch.

01:02:59.275 --> 01:03:01.903
Why do you enjoy pissing me off so much?

01:03:06.616 --> 01:03:08.951
Now, if you're just
going to act the same way with--

01:03:11.871 --> 01:03:14.791
When I make a mistake,
Jecs does not punish me.

01:03:16.417 --> 01:03:19.962
He doesn't raise his voice at me,
he doesn't cuss me.

01:03:20.463 --> 01:03:22.965
And most of all, he doesn't beat me up.

01:03:41.192 --> 01:03:42.026
So?

01:03:42.735 --> 01:03:43.569
He's not here?

01:03:45.112 --> 01:03:46.239
He's not coming?

01:03:50.618 --> 01:03:53.329
He found another reason to punish me.

01:04:15.393 --> 01:04:20.273
A word of warning to the residents along
coastal areas of Regions Four and Five.

01:04:20.356 --> 01:04:24.735
The low-pressure area
is expected to stay in those regions.

01:04:26.237 --> 01:04:27.154
Shit.

01:04:27.238 --> 01:04:29.699
-Love!
-Sorry. I was gonna shoot a vlog.

01:04:29.782 --> 01:04:31.701
Don't worry,
it's probably gonna come back.

01:04:31.784 --> 01:04:32.994
Let me turn on the flashlight.

01:04:33.077 --> 01:04:33.911
There we go.

01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:36.789
I saw a candle somewhere here.

01:04:39.834 --> 01:04:40.668
Here.

01:04:42.545 --> 01:04:44.088
Shine the light over here.

01:04:51.137 --> 01:04:51.971
I got it.

01:05:16.787 --> 01:05:18.414
Does this thing work or what?

01:05:19.373 --> 01:05:20.207
There.

01:05:20.833 --> 01:05:21.709
Give me a sec.

01:05:23.127 --> 01:05:25.546
Let me light the other one.
Where's your lighter?

01:05:27.465 --> 01:05:29.800
-Let me get my smokes from upstairs.
-Go.

01:05:39.477 --> 01:05:41.604
Hassle, just when I was about to vlog.

01:05:42.104 --> 01:05:44.982
Love, the wind is so strong. It's scary.

01:05:59.372 --> 01:06:00.456
Come on, let's eat.

01:06:11.968 --> 01:06:13.094
What are you looking for?

01:06:13.177 --> 01:06:14.261
My power bank.

01:06:25.189 --> 01:06:26.232
Why are you smoking?

01:06:26.941 --> 01:06:29.819
You'll shoot a vlog, right?
Here's the power bank.

01:06:29.902 --> 01:06:31.237
Your battery will run out.

01:06:31.779 --> 01:06:32.905
Are you mad?

01:06:32.989 --> 01:06:33.990
I don't know.

01:06:34.949 --> 01:06:39.662
The power went out and the first thing
you think about is vlogging.

01:06:40.246 --> 01:06:41.497
I had it scheduled today.

01:06:42.039 --> 01:06:44.709
Even if the power's out
and there's no signal?

01:06:47.712 --> 01:06:48.796
I know why.

01:06:49.755 --> 01:06:51.674
You're so eager to vlog

01:06:51.757 --> 01:06:55.761
because you get to interact with
what's-her-face with the big boobs?

01:06:56.303 --> 01:06:57.888
You mean Sunshine. My fan.

01:07:00.391 --> 01:07:02.059
You're on a first-name basis.

01:07:02.601 --> 01:07:07.815
Come on, Billie. What's wrong
with her tagging me in her posts?

01:07:07.898 --> 01:07:09.025
It's a big help to me.

01:07:09.859 --> 01:07:11.110
You're following her?

01:07:11.652 --> 01:07:14.655
Sure, 'cause her followers
would tag me, too.

01:07:14.739 --> 01:07:16.699
It'd be weird not to like the posts.

01:07:16.782 --> 01:07:18.451
So you like her posts, too!

01:07:18.534 --> 01:07:19.994
Of course. It's nothing.

01:07:20.077 --> 01:07:22.204
Nothing? Didn't…

01:07:23.330 --> 01:07:25.499
you have something back then?

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.376
See? I remember.

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:30.004
-Your food's getting cold.
-No, answer me.

01:07:32.256 --> 01:07:34.425
Don't laugh at me. Why are you laughing?

01:07:34.508 --> 01:07:36.635
'Cause you're so cute when you're jealous.

01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:40.222
I'm not jealous.
I just want to know the truth.

01:07:40.973 --> 01:07:43.559
You're stirring up trouble
bringing it up like that.

01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:46.812
Yeah, so what happened
between you and Sunshine?

01:07:46.896 --> 01:07:49.648
All right, fine. We flirted for a bit--

01:07:50.149 --> 01:07:51.025
How exactly?

01:07:51.108 --> 01:07:53.778
Okay, no. I was just joking
so you can drop it.

01:07:55.321 --> 01:07:56.822
Just eat. It's gonna get cold.

01:08:23.724 --> 01:08:25.184
Hey, shithead,

01:08:25.267 --> 01:08:27.436
why didn't you include
"What If" in your lineup?

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:29.980
-I've been playing that for three years.
-Exactly.

01:08:30.064 --> 01:08:34.110
-That's what your audience came to hear.
-Then I'll play it towards the end.

01:08:34.193 --> 01:08:36.946
-If somebody requests for it.
-Of course they will, asshole.

01:08:37.029 --> 01:08:39.156
So just play it at the start
so it's over with.

01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:40.699
Okay, fine. I'll do it.

01:08:42.827 --> 01:08:44.995
-Hey, Shine. What's up?
-Hi!

01:08:45.996 --> 01:08:49.166
It's been a long time.
Where did we last see each other?

01:08:49.250 --> 01:08:52.670
At Konnichiwa,
Angelo's bar in San Antonio.

01:08:53.254 --> 01:08:54.088
Right?

01:08:54.922 --> 01:08:55.840
I don't know.

01:08:57.007 --> 01:08:58.384
No, no, she's right.

01:08:58.467 --> 01:09:02.012
Fuck, we were shooting Jägers that time.
We were all fucked up. Right?

01:09:02.096 --> 01:09:02.930
Just you.

01:09:03.639 --> 01:09:05.516
You drink yourself blind.

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:07.434
Right?

01:09:08.352 --> 01:09:10.020
We even drove you home.

01:09:11.272 --> 01:09:12.439
Isn't that right, Jecs?

01:09:12.940 --> 01:09:15.192
-Were you guys together?
-I can't remember.

01:09:16.110 --> 01:09:17.278
Old age getting to you?

01:09:18.529 --> 01:09:19.697
You drove him home

01:09:20.573 --> 01:09:23.576
and then, you drove me home.

01:09:25.244 --> 01:09:26.078
And then--

01:09:26.162 --> 01:09:27.371
Wait, wait, wait.

01:09:27.872 --> 01:09:30.499
Before I forget, can you guys do a collab?

01:09:30.583 --> 01:09:31.625
I don't have time.

01:09:31.709 --> 01:09:33.335
I better get back to setting up.

01:09:35.087 --> 01:09:36.213
In a foul mood, is he?

01:09:36.630 --> 01:09:37.631
Let him be.

01:10:04.033 --> 01:10:06.952
Do you think of me

01:10:17.546 --> 01:10:24.511
The way I think of you

01:10:29.266 --> 01:10:31.101
Let's all give him a hand!

01:10:31.185 --> 01:10:36.649
I'm falling for you

01:10:36.732 --> 01:10:38.150
I love you, Jecs!

01:10:44.114 --> 01:10:51.080
Can I come and see you

01:10:59.630 --> 01:11:00.965
What's happening?

01:11:06.011 --> 01:11:07.137
He just stopped.

01:11:08.764 --> 01:11:09.682
Why?

01:11:18.482 --> 01:11:25.447
What if I never will?

01:11:31.328 --> 01:11:38.294
Tomorrow won't be the same without you

01:11:43.882 --> 01:11:50.848
I'll just sing my heart out

01:11:56.478 --> 01:12:01.191
I don't really know, maybe I am…

01:12:19.335 --> 01:12:20.836
Hello, Ma? What's wrong?

01:12:20.919 --> 01:12:24.256
Hello, bro. Nothing! Ma's just worried.

01:12:25.090 --> 01:12:26.800
Why is your video all blurry?

01:12:26.884 --> 01:12:28.260
The typhoon hasn't left yet?

01:12:28.344 --> 01:12:29.970
It's raining pretty hard out here.

01:12:30.054 --> 01:12:32.473
Can we switch to voice call?

01:12:33.557 --> 01:12:34.892
I need to conserve my battery.

01:12:34.975 --> 01:12:37.478
We don't know when
the electricity's gonna come back.

01:12:37.561 --> 01:12:41.732
Wait, did you mention
the dragon oil to Billie yet?

01:12:41.815 --> 01:12:43.317
I can send it over.

01:12:46.028 --> 01:12:47.196
You don't have to do that.

01:12:47.279 --> 01:12:49.740
She won't drink it.
We'll talk about it later, Ma.

01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:52.701
A grandchild is all I'm asking.

01:12:52.785 --> 01:12:53.869
Out of all the women,

01:12:53.952 --> 01:12:56.246
you had to fall in love
with the barren one.

01:12:57.122 --> 01:12:58.040
Ma.

01:13:01.251 --> 01:13:02.127
This is so good.

01:13:04.922 --> 01:13:06.173
I really need to go. Bye.

01:13:06.256 --> 01:13:08.300
-Bye!
-Bye, son.

01:13:11.595 --> 01:13:13.222
Love, let's have some snacks.

01:13:13.305 --> 01:13:14.306
What do you have?

01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:16.058
Sardines, your favorite.

01:13:16.892 --> 01:13:17.851
Don't feel like it.

01:13:19.937 --> 01:13:22.523
And I brewed some coffee.
I don't want to eat alone.

01:13:23.148 --> 01:13:24.066
I'm not hungry.

01:13:25.109 --> 01:13:25.984
So, Mama called?

01:13:27.778 --> 01:13:31.073
Yeah, she's worried about the storm.

01:13:33.075 --> 01:13:34.910
Yeah, she's worried about the storm.

01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:40.874
Why did you laugh earlier?

01:13:41.834 --> 01:13:43.752
-When?
-On the call.

01:13:45.421 --> 01:13:46.338
Which part?

01:13:46.422 --> 01:13:48.549
When your mother called me barren.

01:13:57.266 --> 01:13:58.934
No, it's nothing.

01:13:59.017 --> 01:14:01.603
-It's not what you think.
-It's not "nothing."

01:14:03.272 --> 01:14:07.359
It was an insult.
What happened isn't my fault, okay?

01:14:08.527 --> 01:14:11.905
Billie, why are you taking that seriously?
Didn't I tell you,

01:14:12.823 --> 01:14:15.159
Mama's just requesting for a grandchild.

01:14:15.242 --> 01:14:18.745
I've been telling you that over and over.
You're being so…

01:14:20.247 --> 01:14:22.624
Being so… what? Stupid?

01:14:23.292 --> 01:14:25.836
Is that what you wanted to say?
That I'm being stupid?

01:14:25.919 --> 01:14:28.547
Did I say that? I said nothing like that!

01:14:29.506 --> 01:14:32.301
Why are you driving me up a wall
like I did something wrong?

01:14:32.384 --> 01:14:33.427
Fuck this life!

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:33.028
You're just like Daddy after all.

01:15:34.446 --> 01:15:36.240
I didn't cuss at you, okay?

01:15:36.907 --> 01:15:39.034
I'm just frustrated by all of this.

01:15:40.661 --> 01:15:43.997
You're directing your anger at me.
It was Mama who said it, not me.

01:15:44.081 --> 01:15:47.251
That's why I don't understand
why you're pissed at me.

01:15:47.334 --> 01:15:48.418
I didn't do anything.

01:15:50.087 --> 01:15:51.672
You're not doing anything.

01:15:51.755 --> 01:15:52.881
Is that a crime?

01:15:54.633 --> 01:15:57.302
When your mother tattled to your Auntie

01:15:57.386 --> 01:15:59.805
that I'm never gonna get pregnant,
did you get mad?

01:15:59.888 --> 01:16:02.724
When your mother called me barren,
did it upset you?

01:16:02.808 --> 01:16:06.103
I asked you earlier why you laughed,
you denied it.

01:16:06.186 --> 01:16:10.357
I wasn't laughing at you.
I just realized that Mama's so old-school.

01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:12.818
Then why aren't you defending me?

01:16:12.901 --> 01:16:14.528
The situation wasn't that dire.

01:16:15.612 --> 01:16:17.531
-What do you call it?
-It's called…

01:16:18.949 --> 01:16:20.200
We can still have a baby.

01:16:20.284 --> 01:16:22.536
The doctor said
we still have a chance, right?

01:16:24.621 --> 01:16:26.081
We've been through this, Jecs.

01:16:26.164 --> 01:16:31.712
I told you before we got married
I don't want to have children.

01:16:34.423 --> 01:16:38.010
You said, "Our love will be enough,"
and now I need to…

01:16:39.261 --> 01:16:40.929
have a child with you?

01:16:41.722 --> 01:16:44.558
Will you love me more
if I gave you a child?

01:16:44.641 --> 01:16:46.768
That's not what I'm saying at all.

01:16:47.561 --> 01:16:50.981
Then what do you mean?
Because up to now you're still hoping!

01:16:51.481 --> 01:16:52.983
Is it wrong to have some hope?

01:16:54.484 --> 01:16:55.902
And I'm not forcing anyone.

01:16:55.986 --> 01:16:59.072
I'm just saying you can accept
that we're not out of options.

01:16:59.156 --> 01:17:00.198
Why don't we try them?

01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:04.494
-I don't even remember being a child.
-Stop yelling.

01:17:04.578 --> 01:17:06.038
We're not gonna get anywhere!

01:18:07.849 --> 01:18:08.725
We're coming in.

01:18:11.436 --> 01:18:12.479
You're finally here.

01:18:12.562 --> 01:18:16.858
Hello, we're so sorry for taking
so long to get back!

01:18:16.942 --> 01:18:18.902
-At least you're safe.
-That is true.

01:18:18.985 --> 01:18:24.408
The coast guard wouldn't let us sail.
The waves were enormous.

01:18:24.491 --> 01:18:27.619
I was able to take a video, ma'am. Sir…

01:18:27.703 --> 01:18:29.913
We weren't supposed to be back
till tomorrow.

01:18:29.996 --> 01:18:32.416
We only asked permission
from the coast guard.

01:18:32.999 --> 01:18:34.710
Were you okay?

01:18:34.793 --> 01:18:36.002
We're doing fine.

01:18:36.086 --> 01:18:39.172
The power just went out
but it's gonna come back soon, right?

01:18:39.256 --> 01:18:43.093
It's back. Hang on a second. Let me check.

01:18:49.057 --> 01:18:49.975
There we go!

01:18:50.058 --> 01:18:52.185
-Power's back!
-We have electricity.

01:18:52.269 --> 01:18:53.854
Francis…

01:18:55.689 --> 01:18:57.149
Sir, ma'am…

01:18:57.232 --> 01:19:01.403
Excuse us, we have to inspect our house
because our roof got blown off.

01:19:01.486 --> 01:19:02.487
-Really?
-Yes, ma'am.

01:19:02.571 --> 01:19:03.905
-We'll be right back.
-Yes.

01:19:03.989 --> 01:19:05.949
I just need to tidy up
things that got wet.

01:19:06.032 --> 01:19:07.534
-We'll be back.
-Do you need help?

01:19:07.617 --> 01:19:10.078
No need, ma'am.
Let me put away the groceries.

01:19:10.162 --> 01:19:12.330
I'll bring food with me when I get back.

01:19:12.414 --> 01:19:14.499
-Excuse me, ma'am.
-We won't be long.

01:19:14.583 --> 01:19:15.417
Okay.

01:19:22.424 --> 01:19:23.300
The power's back.

01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:24.634
I know.

01:19:26.261 --> 01:19:27.179
Charge your phone.

01:19:27.637 --> 01:19:28.638
I was just about to.

01:19:53.455 --> 01:19:55.290
Sorry, Gina. This place is such a mess.

01:19:55.373 --> 01:19:58.084
-I'm really sorry.
-Not at all. That's okay.

01:19:59.127 --> 01:19:59.961
Ma'am.

01:20:02.130 --> 01:20:04.132
Not that I'm meddling,

01:20:04.841 --> 01:20:09.095
-but is everything okay with you both?
-No, yeah, we're okay.

01:20:10.722 --> 01:20:14.392
I know those looks, ma'am.

01:20:16.019 --> 01:20:21.608
You know, it's normal for couples
to argue from time to time.

01:20:23.193 --> 01:20:24.903
It's no issue at all.

01:20:24.986 --> 01:20:28.615
It's good that you're able to express
your frustrations with each other.

01:20:29.699 --> 01:20:31.326
But let me tell you this, ma'am,

01:20:32.244 --> 01:20:37.332
everything will feel much lighter
once you have a child together.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:40.126
That's a fact, ma'am.

01:21:17.497 --> 01:21:18.790
What's this really about?

01:21:22.919 --> 01:21:24.045
You know…

01:21:25.005 --> 01:21:28.383
if you still don't get it,
maybe you don't deserve to know.

01:21:30.886 --> 01:21:33.513
How would I know what
I don't deserve to know

01:21:33.597 --> 01:21:34.973
if you won't tell me?

01:21:38.268 --> 01:21:39.102
Sit down.

01:22:15.305 --> 01:22:18.558
You're always posting about me being
the hashtag perfect wife.

01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:39.955
And, I said this upstairs.
I don't think you heard me, but I said,

01:22:49.631 --> 01:22:54.135
"You're useless, I don't like you,
you'll never amount to anything,

01:22:54.219 --> 01:22:57.472
nobody will ever stay with you,
nobody will ever like you."

01:23:05.563 --> 01:23:07.023
maybe he's right.

01:23:21.997 --> 01:23:24.499
Even this plant didn't last with me.

01:26:25.805 --> 01:26:27.015
Sorry about earlier.

01:26:29.392 --> 01:26:31.227
I don't know why I started crying.

01:26:31.311 --> 01:26:32.187
Me, too.

01:26:36.316 --> 01:26:37.859
I thought someone died.

01:26:41.321 --> 01:26:44.490
I threw out your dead plant
so you won't have to cry over it.

01:26:58.504 --> 01:26:59.547
Are we good?

01:27:02.717 --> 01:27:04.302
I already said sorry, didn't I?

01:27:06.554 --> 01:27:07.639
I'm sorry.

01:27:16.356 --> 01:27:17.607
I'm sorry for everything.

01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:22.153
For everything?

01:27:36.209 --> 01:27:39.671
Have you ever had sex with a celebrity?
Or anyone famous?

01:27:40.546 --> 01:27:41.381
Who?

01:27:42.966 --> 01:27:44.050
Where?

01:27:44.133 --> 01:27:45.468
When?

01:27:45.551 --> 01:27:47.262
That's such a personal question!

01:27:47.345 --> 01:27:48.471
Go on, just answer it!

01:27:48.554 --> 01:27:50.682
You see, I've been his fan from the start.

01:27:51.391 --> 01:27:55.687
When he sings,
the rest of the world fades behind us.

01:27:56.729 --> 01:27:59.315
Have you guys done the deed?
He took you out and everything?

01:27:59.399 --> 01:28:02.068
Hey, don't be like that.
His wife might see this.

01:28:03.278 --> 01:28:07.365
"What If" you accidentally mention
his name, what happens then?

01:28:07.448 --> 01:28:10.952
"What If" I'm just being honest?

01:28:12.954 --> 01:28:14.122
Stop it, darling.

01:28:15.748 --> 01:28:16.958
What are you doing in there?

01:28:17.709 --> 01:28:18.543
Nothing.

01:28:20.378 --> 01:28:21.212
You okay?

01:28:41.607 --> 01:28:45.069
Have you guys done the deed?
He took you out and everything?

01:28:45.570 --> 01:28:48.573
Hey, don't be like that.
His wife might see this.

01:28:49.490 --> 01:28:53.745
"What If" you accidentally mention
his name, what happens then?

01:28:53.828 --> 01:28:57.623
"What If" I'm just being honest?

01:28:59.250 --> 01:29:01.085
What have I got to do with that?

01:29:03.838 --> 01:29:04.672
Nothing!

01:29:07.300 --> 01:29:08.134
Nothing?

01:29:08.676 --> 01:29:09.719
-Nothing.
-Wow.

01:29:10.303 --> 01:29:12.430
Why do you even believe anything she says?

01:29:23.232 --> 01:29:24.192
What if?

01:29:26.444 --> 01:29:28.905
What if everyone who sees this video,

01:29:28.988 --> 01:29:32.992
realizes it's you and you're the only one
who won't confess to it?

01:29:33.076 --> 01:29:37.580
What do I have to confess?
She's just clout-chasing for her vlogs.

01:29:38.164 --> 01:29:39.916
She's screaming for your attention.

01:29:40.625 --> 01:29:43.920
What if you're just a gullible viewer

01:29:44.003 --> 01:29:48.174
wasting your time reading too much
into absolute horseshit?

01:29:51.469 --> 01:29:53.429
Am I the only one with that song title?

01:30:01.104 --> 01:30:03.314
They didn't say it was a song.

01:30:06.359 --> 01:30:07.235
Whatever.

01:30:43.312 --> 01:30:44.647
Good morning, ma'am.

01:30:48.693 --> 01:30:49.652
Hello.

01:31:29.817 --> 01:31:30.651
I'll do it.

01:31:36.449 --> 01:31:37.283
If you…

01:31:38.034 --> 01:31:41.579
If you need anything else,
I'll be in my house.

01:33:01.617 --> 01:33:02.493
Francis.

01:33:05.121 --> 01:33:05.955
Mr. Jecs.

01:33:07.456 --> 01:33:09.500
I was just fixing something on the boat.

01:33:09.583 --> 01:33:11.585
Sorry, it looks really dirty right now.

01:33:11.669 --> 01:33:15.923
I'll probably have
time tomorrow to tidy up.

01:33:19.135 --> 01:33:20.469
What's going on with you?

01:33:22.638 --> 01:33:23.848
Just out here hiding.

01:33:25.850 --> 01:33:28.894
I wanted a moment of peace
with my mobile games

01:33:28.978 --> 01:33:30.771
without someone nagging me.

01:33:33.774 --> 01:33:35.693
What about you? Why are you by yourself?

01:33:35.776 --> 01:33:38.195
I needed some time to think.

01:33:39.405 --> 01:33:40.239
Mr. Jecs,

01:33:41.157 --> 01:33:43.826
I know it's none of my business

01:33:44.994 --> 01:33:46.329
but are you guys fighting?

01:33:46.620 --> 01:33:48.831
-Is it obvious?
-I'm not…

01:33:48.914 --> 01:33:51.292
I'm no stranger to those situations.

01:33:51.375 --> 01:33:57.214
You can probably still smooth it over
with a little sweet talk.

01:33:57.298 --> 01:33:59.842
And some gentle touching in the evenings.

01:33:59.925 --> 01:34:01.010
But with some action.

01:34:01.093 --> 01:34:01.927
She's jealous.

01:34:02.011 --> 01:34:03.512
Oh, no. Jealousy?

01:34:04.138 --> 01:34:05.723
It's like a shadow, sir.

01:34:05.806 --> 01:34:09.310
Always creeping behind us.
It's a curse on us handsome men.

01:34:11.437 --> 01:34:14.523
Pour a drink for Mr. Jecs.

01:34:14.607 --> 01:34:15.524
It's too early.

01:34:16.025 --> 01:34:16.942
Sir.

01:34:17.735 --> 01:34:20.905
It's never too early
when you have a problem.

01:34:23.532 --> 01:34:25.910
Besides, it's just one shot.

01:34:27.995 --> 01:34:31.082
Tell you the truth, sir,

01:34:33.876 --> 01:34:39.507
I just want a break
from my wife's constant nagging.

01:34:39.590 --> 01:34:43.219
She's like a radio
that never runs out of batteries.

01:34:45.262 --> 01:34:46.097
It never ends.

01:34:46.180 --> 01:34:47.681
It never does.

01:34:48.224 --> 01:34:52.353
And if she gets started with her litanies,
better bear it in silence.

01:34:52.436 --> 01:34:54.897
Else you'd be digging your own grave.

01:34:56.357 --> 01:34:57.900
It all comes back to you.

01:34:59.443 --> 01:35:00.694
It all comes back to me.

01:35:02.988 --> 01:35:05.199
Women like that were destined for us

01:35:05.282 --> 01:35:09.620
to test our patience.

01:35:12.039 --> 01:35:13.624
Because if I didn't love Gina,

01:35:14.417 --> 01:35:17.169
I'd have buried her
in the sand along with the trash.

01:35:25.261 --> 01:35:26.137
Ma'am?

01:35:26.637 --> 01:35:28.722
Did my husband come by?

01:35:29.223 --> 01:35:30.683
I didn't see him.

01:35:31.642 --> 01:35:35.604
Could I ask you a favor?
Maybe Mr. Jecs sent him on an errand.

01:35:38.023 --> 01:35:42.194
Jecs went out a while back.
I don't know where he's gone either.

01:35:43.821 --> 01:35:45.614
Where is that monkey?

01:35:46.532 --> 01:35:51.078
Francis told me he'll just clean
the beach and the boat.

01:35:51.162 --> 01:35:55.166
He's probably drinking with the boatmen
from the neighboring island.

01:35:55.249 --> 01:35:56.083
Gina!

01:35:56.167 --> 01:35:57.585
-Ma'am?
-I'm coming with you.

01:35:59.295 --> 01:36:02.339
Better drop it, drop it, drop it now

01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:09.597
Better drop it, drop it, drop it now

01:36:11.724 --> 01:36:12.892
Come on. Let's drop it.

01:36:13.350 --> 01:36:16.979
Better drop it, drop it, drop it now

01:36:17.813 --> 01:36:21.025
Better drop it, drop it, drop it now

01:36:21.108 --> 01:36:22.359
Hey!

01:36:22.443 --> 01:36:24.653
Better drop it, drop it, drop it now

01:36:24.737 --> 01:36:25.821
Francis!

01:36:26.614 --> 01:36:28.240
Hey! What the heck?

01:36:29.033 --> 01:36:30.784
What is this bullshit?

01:36:31.368 --> 01:36:32.912
What did you tell me?

01:36:33.996 --> 01:36:37.082
You said you'll be cleaning
the boat and the beach.

01:36:37.166 --> 01:36:40.544
Why are you doing the "drop-drop"
and getting wasted?

01:36:40.628 --> 01:36:45.007
You drive me crazy, I swear to God.
I've been looking all over for you.

01:36:45.090 --> 01:36:47.176
Gina, it's okay! That's okay!

01:36:49.303 --> 01:36:52.765
A toast to our demon wives!

01:36:56.936 --> 01:36:57.811
Except you.

01:37:01.732 --> 01:37:03.067
Because you're perfect.

01:37:04.985 --> 01:37:06.028
No, really.

01:37:06.111 --> 01:37:11.075
Because you accept what I do for a living,
you've helped my family,

01:37:12.243 --> 01:37:13.661
and you're not just

01:37:14.453 --> 01:37:15.454
beautiful,

01:37:16.455 --> 01:37:18.207
you're also sexy.

01:37:19.208 --> 01:37:21.919
You may have small boobs,
but you're still sexy.

01:37:23.796 --> 01:37:24.630
And…

01:37:26.966 --> 01:37:29.009
you're jealous of Sunshine?

01:37:30.719 --> 01:37:33.472
Her tits are huge! She's all boobs!

01:37:34.431 --> 01:37:35.975
She's got nothing on you!

01:37:36.058 --> 01:37:39.520
Do you really want to know if something
happened between me and Sunshine?

01:37:39.603 --> 01:37:41.897
I'll tell you.
I'll tell you the honest truth.

01:37:41.981 --> 01:37:43.607
Right now! I'll tell you.

01:37:44.441 --> 01:37:45.693
Did something happen?

01:37:46.819 --> 01:37:50.322
nothing happened between me and Sunshine.

01:37:50.406 --> 01:37:51.240
Nothing at all.

01:37:51.323 --> 01:37:54.451
I didn't even kiss her!

01:37:56.870 --> 01:37:58.247
She just gave me a blowjob.

01:38:15.389 --> 01:38:16.223
Thanks.

01:38:20.561 --> 01:38:21.395
See?

01:38:21.478 --> 01:38:22.313
See?

01:38:23.647 --> 01:38:25.024
See what you did?

01:38:44.251 --> 01:38:45.336
Ma!

01:38:45.419 --> 01:38:46.670
What now?

01:38:46.754 --> 01:38:48.172
Let's just talk tomorrow.

01:41:44.765 --> 01:41:45.641
What?

01:42:18.090 --> 01:42:18.924
Hello, Dianne.

01:42:19.424 --> 01:42:20.259
What happened?

01:42:20.342 --> 01:42:21.885
Mama's gone.

01:42:24.429 --> 01:42:25.305
What?

01:42:25.889 --> 01:42:28.058
She wouldn't listen.

01:42:28.141 --> 01:42:31.061
She ate all the things
she wasn't supposed to eat.

01:42:32.896 --> 01:42:37.150
Jecs, please come home.

01:43:47.554 --> 01:43:49.765
She called me last night.
I didn't pick up.

01:43:56.146 --> 01:43:58.523
You didn't know this was going to happen.

01:44:02.027 --> 01:44:04.112
I feel like she's still about to call.

01:44:05.405 --> 01:44:06.698
Ask me how I'm doing.

01:44:07.407 --> 01:44:09.368
Ask for her phone's password.

01:44:16.416 --> 01:44:17.918
How's Dianne?

01:44:30.180 --> 01:44:31.098
You?

01:44:36.144 --> 01:44:37.145
Drowning.

01:44:45.988 --> 01:44:46.822
And us?

01:44:50.492 --> 01:44:51.451
I don't know.

01:44:57.207 --> 01:44:59.459
I'm sorry for the things I said.

01:45:00.502 --> 01:45:02.170
For everything that I did to you.

01:45:05.132 --> 01:45:07.217
I'm sorry for leaving.

01:45:13.306 --> 01:45:15.308
I don't know why you came back.

01:45:20.939 --> 01:45:22.190
I feel like…

01:45:26.528 --> 01:45:28.280
I'm running out of breath.

01:45:35.954 --> 01:45:36.955
Me too.

01:45:39.207 --> 01:45:40.834
I'm also drowning.

01:45:44.337 --> 01:45:45.380
Let's go home.

01:45:55.390 --> 01:45:57.642
Are we ever gonna go back
to the way we were?
