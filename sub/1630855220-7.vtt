WEBVTT

00:29.680 --> 00:33.600
TURN OF THE TIDE

00:54.560 --> 00:55.440
What?

00:55.440 --> 00:56.800
That's intense.

00:56.800 --> 01:00.200
And you call yourself a fisherman?
Police dogs fucking hate fish.

01:00.200 --> 01:03.560
Don't force me to leave this chair
to pick you up there. Understood?

01:04.760 --> 01:07.000
Uh, I have to go now. I'll call you back.

01:08.960 --> 01:09.920
Hey, Joe.

01:10.680 --> 01:12.640
Come in. Take your seat.

01:13.240 --> 01:16.000
That's too soft for me.
You take it, Eduardo.

01:19.400 --> 01:20.800
I made all the arrangements.

01:20.800 --> 01:22.800
And the other things I asked for?

01:25.360 --> 01:28.200
Good. Now, can you leave us alone
for a minute?

01:28.200 --> 01:29.120
Sure.

01:30.160 --> 01:31.240
Be my guests.

01:36.120 --> 01:38.040
Are you sure this is a good idea?

01:38.920 --> 01:39.960
Tuna cans?

01:41.280 --> 01:44.960
I'm pretty sure this is a terrible idea,
but do you have a better one?

01:45.720 --> 01:48.200
And how did you convince Feliciano
to be a part of this?

01:48.200 --> 01:52.040
If his ugly name is on those tuna cans,
he owes it to me.

01:52.840 --> 01:53.800
Now, listen.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.400
The ship will go past the island, hmm?

01:57.400 --> 01:59.200
I've arranged it with the captain.

01:59.800 --> 02:02.320
But they won't wait for you.
They won't slow down.

02:03.040 --> 02:05.560
- So you only have one shot. Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

02:05.560 --> 02:07.520
Everything goes according to plan,

02:07.520 --> 02:09.880
you're going to America
the old-fashioned way.

02:13.360 --> 02:14.960
This is a burner, prepaid.

02:16.440 --> 02:17.800
If you want to talk to me.

02:19.920 --> 02:20.760
Uncle Joe,

02:21.960 --> 02:24.640
I still can't believe, with how shady
this is, that you're helping me.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.320
Don't get yourself fooled, kid.

02:29.040 --> 02:31.560
I ain't no <i>Santa Casa da Misericórdia.</i>

02:31.560 --> 02:33.400
This is an investment, hmm?

02:34.320 --> 02:36.520
You and I, we're the same, you know?

02:36.520 --> 02:37.520
Yeah.

02:38.080 --> 02:40.680
We gotta keep moving like sharks,
otherwise we die.

02:44.560 --> 02:46.120
Hey! One more thing.

02:46.720 --> 02:47.600
Open the drawer.

02:53.520 --> 02:55.080
That's a graduation gift.

02:56.480 --> 02:59.720
Now you're officially a businessman
on his way to America.

03:00.400 --> 03:01.720
Small fish

03:01.720 --> 03:03.440
in a huge pond.

03:07.040 --> 03:10.760
Eduardo Melo, fisherman,
vanished off Rabo de Peixe.

03:10.760 --> 03:12.200
As did this guy, Arruda,

03:12.200 --> 03:15.840
whose driver fell off a lighthouse
where we found traces of a shoot-out.

03:16.880 --> 03:20.040
That same week, Rafael,
Eduardo's best friend,

03:20.040 --> 03:21.920
disappeared without a trace,

03:21.920 --> 03:24.640
and the father of our suspect
was found murdered,

03:24.640 --> 03:26.080
killed with a flare gun.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.640
All connected to Eduardo Melo.

03:28.640 --> 03:30.480
The case of the missing flying driver

03:30.480 --> 03:32.760
and the blind guy
who got to see a flying bullet.

03:34.080 --> 03:35.280
Yeah?

03:35.280 --> 03:37.080
You have any news
about Bonino's whereabouts,

03:37.080 --> 03:38.000
Detective Banha?

03:38.000 --> 03:39.120
I'm afraid I do.

03:39.640 --> 03:40.800
I understand.

03:40.800 --> 03:43.560
It's for you, detective.
From Lisbon, it's the director.

03:47.040 --> 03:48.360
Hello, director.

03:48.360 --> 03:52.360
Gentlemen, we have
an original art piece from this nut job.

03:54.560 --> 03:55.720
<i>PASTA ALLA POMPINO</i> RECIPE

03:55.720 --> 03:57.040
Of course, I understand.

03:57.760 --> 03:59.680
No, no, please.
I understand you perfectly.

03:59.680 --> 04:03.200
It's Bonino's goodbye note
before he escaped from prison.

04:07.280 --> 04:11.080
Son of a bitch! You scared me.
I thought I wouldn't see you again.

04:12.120 --> 04:14.560
I came to bring you
what's rightfully yours.

04:18.920 --> 04:20.280
Take it. You've earned it.

04:22.960 --> 04:26.560
Remember when we were in school
and I didn't have lunch?

04:26.560 --> 04:28.560
You would always give me
half your sandwich.

04:29.160 --> 04:30.720
But this is no sandwich.

04:31.840 --> 04:33.240
And like Sandrinho says,

04:34.040 --> 04:35.560
ah, that life was not for me.

04:37.440 --> 04:39.320
Then give it to someone who needs it.

04:41.200 --> 04:44.960
You know, I mean, there are plenty
of people who need help in Rabo de Peixe.

04:46.920 --> 04:49.320
I'd love it if you could stay
to watch the choir.

04:49.320 --> 04:51.520
You won't even believe
how much we've improved.

04:53.040 --> 04:55.920
Mm-hmm! Those are fancy cards.

04:59.680 --> 05:01.080
If you need me, call.

05:02.120 --> 05:03.120
Whatever it is.

05:04.280 --> 05:06.080
I'll always pick up, all right?

05:11.880 --> 05:13.120
Go on.

05:18.800 --> 05:20.040
Shall we?

06:50.200 --> 06:53.560
<i>I need your help.
It's not for me. It's for the boy.</i>

06:54.400 --> 06:55.640
<i>I'm staying.</i>

06:56.600 --> 06:58.440
I still have some things left to handle.

07:01.280 --> 07:02.320
Thank you, Joe.

07:14.840 --> 07:16.440
I can't give you any money, son.

07:17.080 --> 07:19.280
But this is yours. It's your patrimony.

07:19.280 --> 07:21.080
It's your birth certificate.

07:21.080 --> 07:23.760
I want you to take it with you
when you go to America.

07:24.640 --> 07:26.800
- Oh, but Dad, I--
- That's what you've always wanted.

07:26.800 --> 07:28.400
America, right?

07:29.240 --> 07:30.920
I only ask one thing.

07:31.800 --> 07:33.520
Never forget where you came from.

07:33.520 --> 07:35.360
No, of course not.

07:36.240 --> 07:39.520
But as long as you're alive,
you are my father and I'm your son,

07:39.520 --> 07:42.040
so you have to keep this, not me. Hmm?

08:37.920 --> 08:40.400
The poor soul
didn't even get a tombstone.

08:51.440 --> 08:54.640
What were the last words
you said to him before he passed, Eduardo?

08:55.240 --> 08:57.160
I remember mine like it was yesterday.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.600
We were in the kitchen at your house,
and I told him, "Mr. Jeremias."

09:02.600 --> 09:05.880
"Explain to your son that there's
no absolution without repentance."

09:07.880 --> 09:10.440
Unfortunately, it's too late
for that at this point.

09:12.320 --> 09:14.840
Come on, let's go. Let's not keep
your friends waiting any longer.

09:16.160 --> 09:18.280
- I want to make a phone call.
- Phone call?

09:19.280 --> 09:21.280
You watch a lot of movies, don't you?

09:21.280 --> 09:23.320
Calm down. You're not going to prison.

09:24.160 --> 09:25.000
Yet.

09:26.560 --> 09:29.480
All right, let's go.
Come on. In front of me.

09:30.440 --> 09:31.320
Come on.

09:34.800 --> 09:37.280
I've been your uncle's lawyer
for a long time.

09:37.280 --> 09:38.920
It's all going to be fine. Don't worry.

09:51.360 --> 09:52.760
Shall we begin?

09:55.000 --> 09:57.560
As you can imagine, there isn't much
to do on the end of the world.

09:59.280 --> 10:00.480
Right?

10:01.640 --> 10:02.640
We rested up.

10:08.200 --> 10:09.520
And we went fishing.

10:13.040 --> 10:14.200
Great.

10:16.200 --> 10:18.080
And hunting as well.

10:22.640 --> 10:25.600
My uncle has a small vegetable garden.
We planted potatoes.

10:27.480 --> 10:29.080
Potatoes in the middle of summer?

10:29.680 --> 10:30.960
Heavy motherfucker!

10:31.600 --> 10:33.480
And you put up the Christmas tree too?

10:36.360 --> 10:38.280
And what were you doing there?

10:38.280 --> 10:39.560
We did some fishing.

10:42.080 --> 10:43.160
You catch much?

10:43.680 --> 10:46.280
Horse mackerel, angled.
I caught a tuna too.

10:46.280 --> 10:47.960
Go, go!

10:55.160 --> 10:56.520
But it was a small one.

10:57.280 --> 10:58.160
Mmm.

10:59.280 --> 11:00.400
You go by foot?

11:00.400 --> 11:01.560
We took the bus.

11:01.560 --> 11:02.880
We hopped on a bus.

11:02.880 --> 11:03.800
We went by bus.

11:06.760 --> 11:07.960
Couple of hours.

11:07.960 --> 11:10.120
- We walked the beach--
- Okay, let me guess.

11:11.080 --> 11:12.520
For a couple hours, I bet.

11:12.520 --> 11:13.760
Yes, ma'am.

11:13.760 --> 11:16.120
Did you keep the tickets?

11:16.120 --> 11:17.880
No, I didn't keep the tickets.

11:17.880 --> 11:20.480
The tickets?
I'm pretty sure I threw them away.

11:22.960 --> 11:25.760
As far as vacations, it was normal.

11:28.480 --> 11:31.360
You don't remember
anything special?

11:31.360 --> 11:34.080
Um... No, no, no.
I don't remember anything special.

11:35.440 --> 11:37.120
No, I don't remember anything special.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.160
Nothing special.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.120
So if I understand correctly,

11:50.120 --> 11:53.680
your father had just had surgery,
and you decided to take a vacation?

11:54.360 --> 11:56.440
My father was fine post-operation.

11:56.440 --> 11:58.160
Not for long though. Right, Eduardo?

12:02.600 --> 12:04.040
How long had you been together?

12:06.320 --> 12:07.560
Since we were 15.

12:09.480 --> 12:10.560
But we had split up.

12:10.560 --> 12:12.800
Because you overdosed on cocaine.

12:18.600 --> 12:20.680
Nine years together,
your boyfriend disappears,

12:20.680 --> 12:23.160
and you're off on a vacation
with his best friend?

12:26.400 --> 12:30.280
You move into your father's house,
he vanishes, and where are you?

12:30.280 --> 12:31.640
Sunbathing.

12:31.640 --> 12:34.520
Your father's driver falls
from a lighthouse and dies, and you?

12:36.040 --> 12:39.360
Laying around, smoking pot
at a place where nobody can find you.

12:40.040 --> 12:42.560
It must be quite exhausting
working in a video store.

12:42.560 --> 12:43.680
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.040
A video store, so brutal.

12:45.040 --> 12:49.040
I'm already tired
just thinking about it.

12:51.160 --> 12:52.840
I know it couldn't have been easy.

12:53.360 --> 12:55.280
The kids at school
were mean to you, right?

12:55.280 --> 12:56.840
What did they call you?

12:57.760 --> 13:00.560
Nancy? Sissy? Homo?

13:09.320 --> 13:10.760
I'm from Rabo de Peixe.

13:12.080 --> 13:15.040
Do you think I got where I am
by being offended about names?

13:24.680 --> 13:26.680
Do you know what I think, Carlos?

13:26.680 --> 13:29.000
I believe you were dragged along
by the others,

13:29.000 --> 13:31.360
and wanted to help your friends
'cause you're a great guy.

13:31.960 --> 13:33.880
But you don't have to ruin your life.

13:35.400 --> 13:36.960
We can offer you protection.

13:36.960 --> 13:38.920
Pro-- Protection?

13:38.920 --> 13:40.160
From who, huh?

13:40.760 --> 13:43.240
From the sons of bitches
who killed your father.

13:45.560 --> 13:47.600
You stepped on a landmine, am I right?

13:49.160 --> 13:51.160
And then you were unable to undo it.

13:54.560 --> 13:58.040
So when you returned to Rabo de Peixe,
your father had already been buried.

13:58.040 --> 14:00.080
You couldn't even say goodbye to him.

14:02.920 --> 14:04.360
They left him in pretty bad shape.

14:08.800 --> 14:10.600
It must be tough
thinking you're responsible

14:10.600 --> 14:11.800
for your father's death.

14:13.840 --> 14:15.240
Do you think so, detective?

14:16.280 --> 14:17.720
He doesn't look sorry to me.

14:18.240 --> 14:19.640
Mr. Drug Lord here?

14:21.480 --> 14:23.840
With a speech he clearly rehearsed.

14:26.440 --> 14:29.800
My client came here
to cooperate in a police investigation.

14:30.400 --> 14:31.600
Not to be humiliated.

14:31.600 --> 14:34.360
- If you two don't change your--
- Not even pretending to have remorse.

14:34.360 --> 14:36.520
You have no right to talk about my father.

14:38.560 --> 14:40.280
In Rabo de Peixe, we're born second-class,

14:40.280 --> 14:42.360
but that's something
you'll never understand.

14:43.400 --> 14:45.320
At least they let us go on the boat, huh?

14:46.080 --> 14:47.960
I guess someone needs
to work themselves to death

14:47.960 --> 14:49.640
providing fish for the bourgeois.

14:49.640 --> 14:53.160
But is wanting to be more than a fisherman
too much to ask, detective?

14:53.760 --> 14:54.920
Why, huh?

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Why do I have to live a miserable life?

14:58.520 --> 14:59.640
That's a very pretty speech,

14:59.640 --> 15:02.000
but it was your father
who was stabbed in the back.

15:02.520 --> 15:03.760
Am I right?

15:04.760 --> 15:06.520
I understand all you're saying.

15:06.520 --> 15:09.000
I understand that you want
to turn things around.

15:09.760 --> 15:11.720
I am concerned about one thing though.

15:12.320 --> 15:14.720
Not once have you asked
if I had any information

15:14.720 --> 15:16.360
about the person who killed your father.

15:17.440 --> 15:19.600
And if that's not a sign
of guilt, Eduardo,

15:21.080 --> 15:22.760
I honestly don't know what is.

15:22.760 --> 15:25.640
But I do, detective.
Evidence, material evidence.

15:25.640 --> 15:29.280
And you have absolutely no evidence
against my client.

15:29.960 --> 15:32.240
Nothing but disrespect and provocations.

15:33.200 --> 15:34.320
Let's go, Eduardo.

15:36.240 --> 15:37.360
Have a nice one.

15:39.480 --> 15:40.760
He's right on the edge.

15:40.760 --> 15:43.240
And I won't go
without giving him a final push.

15:44.800 --> 15:45.960
But are you sure?

15:45.960 --> 15:48.400
I've known Carlinhos since I was a child<i>.</i>

15:49.400 --> 15:50.960
If you get to one, you'll get 'em all.

15:51.560 --> 15:52.840
And where is he?

15:54.840 --> 15:55.760
I know where.

15:57.400 --> 15:59.240
Did you bring
what I asked for?

16:14.600 --> 16:15.440
Hmm.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.560
I will also need a car.

16:21.200 --> 16:22.680
- You want a car?
- Yeah.

16:22.680 --> 16:24.280
I'll take care of that.

16:24.280 --> 16:27.000
Eduardo's uncle's records
have arrived from the United States.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.040
"Blow-up Joe," an explosives specialist,

16:29.040 --> 16:31.520
was found guilty
of robbing an armored truck.

16:31.520 --> 16:33.960
Up until now, no red flags.

16:33.960 --> 16:36.000
But who was also considered a suspect?

16:36.000 --> 16:38.320
Feliciano Carrilho,
from Feliciano's Canned Food.

16:38.320 --> 16:42.000
And owner of the house where Joe lives
since he was deported to the Azores.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.160
Feliciano and Joe are long-time friends.

16:44.160 --> 16:46.480
The police went looking
for him, still nothing.

16:46.480 --> 16:49.640
But Feliciano is now a successful
and respected businessman.

16:49.640 --> 16:51.240
The best Azorean canned tuna.

16:54.680 --> 16:55.840
Canned tuna?

16:57.200 --> 16:58.960
Are you sure you weren't followed?

16:59.640 --> 17:00.520
Yeah, I'm sure.

17:02.160 --> 17:05.600
But that detective from the mainland
has her claws in us and won't surrender.

17:08.200 --> 17:10.880
Uncle Joe, we have to call everything off.

17:12.240 --> 17:14.880
On the contrary. It's now or never.

17:15.480 --> 17:17.600
But Sílvia and Carlinhos
are my responsibility!

17:17.600 --> 17:19.400
What if something happens
to them, then what?

17:19.400 --> 17:20.680
Well...

17:21.600 --> 17:24.760
...if you hadn't gone to the cemetery,
you wouldn't be in this situation.

17:24.760 --> 17:27.560
So listen to me
and stick to the fucking plan.

17:27.560 --> 17:30.080
I screwed up, okay? I know I screwed up.

17:30.080 --> 17:32.120
I'm trying to clean up
the mess I caused, damn it!

17:32.120 --> 17:35.880
Now's the time to prove to yourself
that you're bigger than this shitty place.

17:35.880 --> 17:38.200
- Stick to the fucking plan.
- Uncle Joe.

17:39.280 --> 17:41.320
- We have to stay here.
- Mm-mmm.

17:41.320 --> 17:42.840
At least for now, okay?

17:42.840 --> 17:44.600
Remember who else stayed here?

17:46.880 --> 17:49.200
It was your mother.
Look what happened to her.

17:49.200 --> 17:51.800
- This has nothing to do with my mother!
- Of course it does!

18:01.360 --> 18:04.000
I've carried her death
all these fucking years.

18:08.960 --> 18:10.920
When she was sick, what did I do?

18:12.480 --> 18:13.720
<i>I walked away.</i>

18:20.600 --> 18:22.320
I should have brought her to America.

18:24.440 --> 18:25.920
It was my duty.

18:26.640 --> 18:27.800
My own sister.

18:29.560 --> 18:31.440
I should never have left her here.

18:32.040 --> 18:32.880
Or you.

18:39.520 --> 18:40.600
I had my father.

18:44.520 --> 18:45.960
Well, not anymore, you don't.

18:47.920 --> 18:49.120
But you got me, kid.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.880
You wanted to know why I was helping you.

18:58.320 --> 18:59.280
There it is.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.840
I couldn't save your mother.

19:04.720 --> 19:05.840
Gotta save you.

19:11.960 --> 19:13.360
I gotta save you.

19:22.640 --> 19:24.920
I think that in America,
I'm going to be free.

19:26.800 --> 19:27.920
Be who I am, you know?

19:29.200 --> 19:31.400
Carlinhos, you're the freest person
I know.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.920
You can be Carlinhos here
or in Fall River. It doesn't matter.

19:37.120 --> 19:38.040
What about you?

19:39.480 --> 19:41.760
Hmm? What are you going to be?

19:43.200 --> 19:44.120
I don't know.

19:46.760 --> 19:49.960
I've always wanted
to be someone else, somewhere else.

19:51.360 --> 19:53.160
Now that it's about to happen,
I don't know.

19:53.160 --> 19:54.920
I think I like it here after all.

20:01.440 --> 20:04.640
I honestly feel like poison
is coursing through my veins.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.320
And each day that passes,
that poison kills me a little bit more.

20:12.840 --> 20:14.640
Going to America could be the cure.

20:20.080 --> 20:22.000
No matter what happens, you two stay here.

20:29.600 --> 20:31.040
So you think America's the cure?

20:34.080 --> 20:35.960
Could just be a different poison.

20:44.440 --> 20:47.160
I need a quick turnaround on this.
Yes, I understand,

20:47.160 --> 20:50.440
but like the file says, we only have
a couple of hours. If we don't hurry up--

20:51.720 --> 20:54.640
- Very well, I'll hold.
- Should I set up surveillance teams?

20:54.640 --> 20:56.680
It's too late for surveillance.
We have to move.

20:56.680 --> 20:58.160
We're taking these guys down today.

20:58.160 --> 21:00.120
All due respect,
I know you want to solve this

21:00.120 --> 21:01.600
before getting back to Lisbon but--

21:01.600 --> 21:02.520
Yes, sir.

21:03.920 --> 21:06.640
Thank you very much, sir.
We have a search warrant.

21:07.640 --> 21:08.960
Call everyone in the brigade.

21:24.320 --> 21:27.000
I don't know if they're gonna survive
for long out there,

21:27.800 --> 21:29.600
but at least here, they were happy.

21:31.040 --> 21:33.080
Not everyone can say the same, right?

21:34.200 --> 21:36.160
Don't you need to do something
before you go?

21:40.240 --> 21:42.440
TUNA FILLETS
CAUGHT AND PACKED IN THE AZORES

22:49.280 --> 22:51.680
I couldn't leave
without giving you an apology.

22:55.560 --> 22:57.960
You don't have to apologize
for anything, Carlos.

22:59.760 --> 23:01.200
Love is not a sin, you know.

23:03.520 --> 23:04.440
You're right.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.360
It's not a sin, but...

23:08.160 --> 23:11.040
I've learned that what we want
is not always good for us.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.640
The last time I got what I wanted,
you wound up in the hospital.

23:18.480 --> 23:20.120
God didn't forsake me, though.

23:34.720 --> 23:37.400
What I feel for you works better
with this between us.

23:38.800 --> 23:40.040
It protects you from me.

24:09.960 --> 24:11.440
The church is closed.

24:16.120 --> 24:18.160
Don't move! Stay down!

24:18.160 --> 24:21.760
Don't move!
Get down, get down, get down!

24:22.880 --> 24:24.040
Quiet!

24:31.640 --> 24:33.280
Where's the cocksucker?

24:35.200 --> 24:36.240
I don't understand you.

24:37.160 --> 24:39.680
- What's "homo" in Portuguese?
- How should I know?

24:39.680 --> 24:42.040
- Weren't you in jail?
- So what?

24:42.040 --> 24:44.400
Are there no homos
in Portuguese jails?

24:44.400 --> 24:45.720
I have no idea!

24:46.280 --> 24:47.480
Where is the homo?

24:47.480 --> 24:48.760
I don't understand you.

24:48.760 --> 24:51.000
- Where is the <i>finocchio?</i>
- No, no, no!

24:51.680 --> 24:54.640
<i>Finocchio's</i> your mother,
you shitty motherfucker! Huh?

24:57.880 --> 25:00.400
Don't you move!
Don't you move.

25:01.680 --> 25:04.000
What is it? Hey! What?

25:19.760 --> 25:22.680
What the fuck? What the fuck!

25:45.240 --> 25:46.920
- Police! Freeze!
- Turn around!

25:50.200 --> 25:51.400
Hands behind your back!

26:02.400 --> 26:03.600
You'll find nothing.

26:06.080 --> 26:09.200
You might have romantic ideas
about your right to remain silent.

26:09.960 --> 26:11.280
But tell me, Joe,

26:12.320 --> 26:15.400
what's sacrificing yourself
for Feliciano brought you?

26:15.400 --> 26:17.760
Unless seven years in prison
and deportation back here

26:17.760 --> 26:19.040
was your dream scenario?

26:21.440 --> 26:22.800
If you give me information,

26:22.800 --> 26:25.200
I can see about getting
your sentence reduced.

26:25.960 --> 26:27.560
All you have to do is cooperate with me.

26:28.440 --> 26:29.840
You'll find nothing.

26:37.120 --> 26:40.840
The longer Eduardo remains a drug dealer,
the worse off his life will be.

26:42.280 --> 26:44.680
One of these days,
he's gonna be where you are now.

26:45.200 --> 26:47.200
Or found dead in a ditch
with a bullet in his head.

26:47.200 --> 26:48.320
Is that what you want?

26:56.360 --> 27:00.520
Talk to Eduardo.
Tell him to come back here by himself.

27:06.800 --> 27:07.960
You won't find shit.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.600
I will, unfortunately for you.

27:17.520 --> 27:20.040
I'm gonna find
exactly what I'm looking for.

27:34.720 --> 27:36.080
Sílvia, we have to go!

27:36.080 --> 27:37.840
- Come on, let's go! Do you hear what--
- Why?

27:37.840 --> 27:40.800
Carlinhos? Where's Carlinhos?
Go grab my uncle's stuff and the cash.

27:40.800 --> 27:44.000
- Eduardo, what the fuck's going on?
- No. The less you know, the better, okay?

27:44.000 --> 27:46.200
"Sílvia, go grab the money,
get my uncle's shit!"

27:46.200 --> 27:48.640
Like I'm your fucking servant,
is that what you think?

27:48.640 --> 27:50.400
This is a business, Sílvia.

27:50.400 --> 27:52.400
You're too busy
snorting this shit to realize!

27:52.400 --> 27:54.240
Snorting it or dealing it,
it's all the same.

27:54.240 --> 27:57.400
What does that even mean?
The video store is your dream job?

27:57.400 --> 27:59.680
You'll end up drinking all day
like your mother?

28:04.360 --> 28:06.400
- Sílvia... No, listen to me.
- Let go!

28:06.400 --> 28:08.720
- Listen to me, I'm sorry.
- Don't touch me, you asshole!

28:09.400 --> 28:10.720
We're going to America.

28:11.800 --> 28:13.480
But I really need your help first.

28:13.480 --> 28:15.440
We need to get away from this.

28:15.960 --> 28:18.520
The only people left on this island
are those who want me dead.

28:18.520 --> 28:20.000
Do this for me, please.

28:21.200 --> 28:22.080
For you?

28:24.600 --> 28:27.520
You just wanted to pay
for your dad's operation, remember?

28:28.120 --> 28:31.000
And to help your friends.
Us unlucky fucks from Rabo de Peixe!

28:31.000 --> 28:32.560
Of course, that's the reason.

28:33.840 --> 28:35.720
But it got complicated, all right?

28:47.560 --> 28:48.400
Hello?

28:50.200 --> 28:52.160
I'm sorry, Eduardo.

28:52.920 --> 28:54.720
Forgive me!

29:01.720 --> 29:03.720
I want what's mine tomorrow.

29:05.600 --> 29:06.720
No more bullshit.

29:06.720 --> 29:09.880
Don't make me do to your friend
what I did to your father.

29:09.880 --> 29:13.120
I'll give you everything back,
I promise, but please.

29:13.120 --> 29:15.440
Please, I beg you. Don't hurt my friend--

29:18.280 --> 29:20.520
What the fuck? Fuck, fuck, fuck!

29:20.520 --> 29:22.400
What's wrong?
What happened? What's going on?

29:22.400 --> 29:24.000
Carlinhos. Carlinhos needs my help.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.800
- What's wrong with Carlinhos?
- That fucker!

29:25.800 --> 29:26.960
Eduardo!

29:26.960 --> 29:28.080
The plan is solid.

29:28.080 --> 29:30.400
Get everything ready,
and meet where we walk Sky.

29:37.240 --> 29:39.520
We have to leave
this place behind.

29:40.480 --> 29:41.400
Eduardo...

29:42.960 --> 29:44.720
I'm not very good at goodbyes.

29:46.360 --> 29:47.320
No one is.

29:48.520 --> 29:51.360
So what are you gonna do
when you arrive in Lisbon?

29:51.360 --> 29:52.480
Get a divorce.

29:55.840 --> 29:57.040
I'm sorry.

29:57.040 --> 29:58.400
What are you sorry about?

30:00.280 --> 30:03.680
You think I would be getting a divorce
if my marriage was functional?

30:04.480 --> 30:07.680
It's still sad.
It marks the end of a relationship.

30:09.120 --> 30:10.880
And the beginning of something new.

30:12.160 --> 30:14.320
It's more depressing
if I were to stay with him.

30:18.800 --> 30:20.320
Thank you for everything, Francisco.

31:04.120 --> 31:06.400
So that's why my men couldn't find you.

31:16.080 --> 31:19.280
Sorry to show up here like this.
There was no other option.

31:19.280 --> 31:22.480
Of course there was.
You could have turned yourself in.

31:26.120 --> 31:27.840
On your knees. Hands behind your head.

31:34.360 --> 31:35.880
If you arrest me now,

31:36.920 --> 31:39.200
you'll never find those
who are truly responsible.

31:40.160 --> 31:41.520
The real drug lords.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.080
That's why you came
to the Azores, isn't it?

31:47.080 --> 31:49.200
This newfound honesty is hard to believe.

31:50.160 --> 31:51.600
It's not about honesty.

31:52.920 --> 31:54.520
It's about justice.

31:57.800 --> 31:59.520
Those bastards killed my dad.

32:12.840 --> 32:15.320
There's something
I've never understood about you.

32:16.600 --> 32:18.720
You have no regrets,
after everything that's happened?

32:20.560 --> 32:22.680
I would do a lot of things differently.

32:27.280 --> 32:29.440
But what haunts me is what I failed to do.

32:39.520 --> 32:42.080
I know you never liked me,
Sílvia, not even a little bit.

32:44.240 --> 32:46.640
But our friendship
wasn't really set up for success.

32:49.400 --> 32:50.760
Your father was an asshole.

32:53.280 --> 32:55.200
But he was my asshole.

32:59.320 --> 33:00.960
He was your asshole too.

33:13.160 --> 33:15.560
I always kind of knew
that it would end badly.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.160
I'm not complaining.

33:19.160 --> 33:21.960
Your father gave me
the finest things in life.

33:21.960 --> 33:23.800
There was a time when I thought...

33:26.480 --> 33:28.080
...he was going to change.

33:29.560 --> 33:31.920
That one day he'd stop
getting his hands dirty.

33:33.000 --> 33:34.440
But Arruda is Arruda.

33:36.200 --> 33:39.640
It wouldn't have been his wife
or daughter that caused him to change.

33:41.320 --> 33:43.440
It's incomplete.

33:47.440 --> 33:49.160
When you're close to someone like Arruda,

33:50.360 --> 33:52.800
everything ends up incomplete.

34:00.080 --> 34:01.360
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

34:02.200 --> 34:03.440
I'm not feeling well.

34:10.800 --> 34:12.000
The fuck? Ow!

34:13.480 --> 34:14.800
What the fuck's that about?

34:14.800 --> 34:17.640
Uh, your breasts are looking
a little swollen, darling.

34:17.640 --> 34:19.120
Huh?

34:19.720 --> 34:22.640
You're feeling sick
because you're pregnant.

36:10.760 --> 36:11.760
Carlinhos!

36:21.120 --> 36:23.040
Show me your hands.

36:24.880 --> 36:26.400
What the fuck is that?

36:28.040 --> 36:28.920
Your drugs.

36:33.680 --> 36:34.720
Look.

36:37.520 --> 36:38.960
The rest is inside the van.

36:39.760 --> 36:40.880
Trust me.

36:41.920 --> 36:43.520
- Trust you?
- Yeah.

36:43.520 --> 36:45.600
You fucking sack of <i>di merda.</i>

36:46.200 --> 36:47.640
Your father trusted you.

36:48.720 --> 36:50.440
- The key of the van.
- No.

36:52.160 --> 36:53.160
My friend first.

37:05.400 --> 37:07.280
You don't learn, do you?

37:17.000 --> 37:18.280
No, no! No!

37:18.280 --> 37:19.560
Oh, my God!

37:24.720 --> 37:26.880
- No, p-- please!
- Let me tell you something.

37:26.880 --> 37:31.240
In real life,
there's no such thing as a free lunch.

37:33.960 --> 37:36.320
- Give me the fucking key now.
- Here, it's here.

37:38.360 --> 37:40.320
The police, Monti! Run!

37:47.640 --> 37:50.080
Bonino, don't force me
to shoot you, all right?

38:14.960 --> 38:17.000
Come on. Almost there.

38:58.120 --> 39:00.200
Open your hand, open your hand.

39:00.200 --> 39:01.840
You're all right.

39:26.240 --> 39:28.320
All right, come on. Get up!

39:34.600 --> 39:37.200
Francisco, are you okay?

39:39.800 --> 39:41.440
Call an ambulance, now!

39:48.400 --> 39:49.560
This is nothing, detective.

39:50.800 --> 39:53.080
Francisco?

39:53.080 --> 39:55.520
I've had worse injuries playing futsal.

40:26.800 --> 40:28.480
That motherfucking piece of shit.

40:35.480 --> 40:37.440
Eduardo.

40:39.160 --> 40:42.240
This isn't America.
You promised to take me to America.

40:42.240 --> 40:44.240
I know, and that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

40:53.040 --> 40:54.120
And Sílvia?

40:54.120 --> 40:56.360
Sílvia is waiting for us
at the boat, Carlinhos.

40:56.880 --> 41:00.720
We'll stop when we get to America.
Right? Next stop is America, Carlinhos!

41:08.000 --> 41:10.040
Sílvia! Sílvia!

41:11.560 --> 41:13.720
Carlinhos, something happened. Sílvia!

41:13.720 --> 41:14.960
- Eduardo, come on.
- Sílvia!

41:16.080 --> 41:17.440
She's not coming.

41:17.440 --> 41:19.560
Something happened.
We have to go get her, okay?

41:19.560 --> 41:20.520
No.

41:21.400 --> 41:22.760
Getting here isn't the problem.

41:23.400 --> 41:24.760
She doesn't want to.

41:26.480 --> 41:27.640
But... how do you know that?

41:28.480 --> 41:31.920
She said. And deep down,
you know her reasons.

41:34.200 --> 41:35.040
Okay.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
- Oh, fuck this!
- Let's go!

41:49.720 --> 41:51.280
Goddamn bastards!

42:50.480 --> 42:51.360
Fuck.

42:52.600 --> 42:54.920
I really didn't want to die
in these lame clothes.

43:00.640 --> 43:01.880
No one's dying today.

43:03.280 --> 43:04.320
You hear?

43:06.480 --> 43:07.840
We're gonna be all right.

43:30.920 --> 43:31.760
Joe.

43:40.080 --> 43:41.880
I told her they would find nothing.

43:46.280 --> 43:47.200
So,

43:48.160 --> 43:49.400
I guess this is goodbye.

43:50.080 --> 43:50.960
A present.

44:00.560 --> 44:01.600
Happy birthday.

44:04.320 --> 44:05.520
You remembered.

44:05.520 --> 44:07.120
Of course I did.

44:08.640 --> 44:09.920
Eleventh of September.

44:15.720 --> 44:16.840
Forgive me.

44:18.280 --> 44:19.200
No.

44:20.720 --> 44:22.680
I'm the one who should be apologizing.

44:24.840 --> 44:25.840
Don't apologize.

44:28.280 --> 44:30.280
After all,
we're on our way to America, huh?

44:33.400 --> 44:35.680
So many people
would love to be in our shoes, right?

46:43.040 --> 46:44.160
Azores.

46:45.560 --> 46:46.920
Best steak in Europe.

47:36.760 --> 47:37.960
Fuck my life.

48:28.040 --> 48:32.160
TURN OF THE TIDE

50:32.960 --> 50:34.480
