Any idea when he's coming back

He didn't run to

Pablo Torres we've

As long as people are more afraid

02:08.065 --> 02:09.499
This is New York, not Rio--

02:09.500 --> 02:11.668
we don't hand our neighborhoods

I'm pushing

02:14.338 --> 02:15.538
Pablo's brother.

02:15.539 --> 02:18.258
Yeah. He might be
more afraid of us.

02:20.478 --> 02:22.045
Glad you stopped by.

02:22.046 --> 02:25.048
Been meaning to give you these since
I heard you got assigned to the 12th.

02:25.049 --> 02:26.182
What is it?

02:26.183 --> 02:28.768
Hold on, I'm gonna show you.

02:28.769 --> 02:30.470
You can always use...

02:30.471 --> 02:32.806
an extra pair
of collar brass.

02:34.391 --> 02:36.593
Thanks, Danny.

02:36.594 --> 02:40.663
On the other hand, you want
to carry something useful...

Nothing better in close quarters.

Where'd you even get
a thing like that?

02:46.929 --> 02:48.238
Right there.

02:48.239 --> 02:50.207
It was Grandpa's?
You didn't think

02:50.208 --> 02:52.159
all those things
were mine, did you?

02:52.160 --> 02:54.328
Thanks, but no thanks.

02:54.329 --> 02:57.281
Suit yourself.

I'm gonna keep my job,

03:04.956 --> 03:08.491
Manhattan District Attorney, and
then we'll take it as it comes.

03:08.492 --> 03:10.494
Thanks, okay? Go Jets.

03:10.495 --> 03:12.129

03:12.130 --> 03:13.864
Hey, A.D.A. Reagan.

03:13.865 --> 03:17.684
You going after Pablo Torres
for money laundering?

03:17.685 --> 03:20.737
What, have you given up on
murder, assault and extortion?

03:20.738 --> 03:23.407
Not given up, just
walking through another door.

03:23.408 --> 03:26.560
Money laundering,
wire fraud, conspiracy.

03:26.561 --> 03:28.679
Based on his
brother's operation,

03:28.680 --> 03:30.547
Esteban Torres.

03:30.548 --> 03:32.950
He's the one who
beat the odds, right?

03:32.951 --> 03:36.620
Academic scholarship,
math teacher at P.S. 389.

03:36.621 --> 03:38.488
Guy opens
a community learning center

03:38.489 --> 03:41.208
to tutor kids
who are getting left behind.

03:41.209 --> 03:42.525
That do-gooder center

03:42.526 --> 03:44.494
was bought with
Pablo's dirty money.

03:44.495 --> 03:46.897
Have you nailed down
the money trail?

03:46.898 --> 03:50.167
We've got cash deposits by
Pablo to the learning center

03:50.168 --> 03:52.052
and checks cut from
the learning center

03:52.053 --> 03:53.470
to Pablo's auto-
detailing shop.

03:53.471 --> 03:54.471
That's money laundering.

03:54.472 --> 03:56.757
And you think Pablo Torres
is gonna roll over

03:56.758 --> 03:58.609
because his schoolteacher
brother got jammed up?

03:58.610 --> 04:00.143
We don't go after
Pablo first--

04:00.144 --> 04:02.012
we target Esteban.

04:02.013 --> 04:03.347
The local hero.

04:03.348 --> 04:05.983
If he refuses to take
the stand and testify

04:05.984 --> 04:08.318
against his brother,
he goes to jail.

04:08.319 --> 04:09.770
He's the only one
who goes to jail.

04:09.771 --> 04:12.155
Never happen. He's
got too much to lose--

04:12.156 --> 04:14.458
family, career, reputation.

04:14.459 --> 04:17.444
You're some
piece of work, Reagan.

04:17.445 --> 04:20.113
High heels and brass knuckles.

04:20.113 --> 04:22.950
I'm passionate
about my job, sir.

04:23.785 --> 04:25.919
All right.

04:25.920 --> 04:28.572
- Is that the green light?
- Yes, but...

04:28.573 --> 04:30.707
next year is an election year--

04:30.708 --> 04:33.126
that means no stink bombs
this year.

04:33.127 --> 04:35.512
Sir, you had 70% of
the vote last time--

04:35.513 --> 04:37.147
who's gonna challenge you?

04:37.148 --> 04:40.217
I got my eyes on a bigger prize
this time around.

04:40.218 --> 04:41.685
Hey.

04:44.322 --> 04:46.423
The police commissioner
is a civilian position, Frank.

04:46.424 --> 04:49.660
I mean, do you think it's wise to
wear the uniform to ceremonies?

04:49.661 --> 04:52.896
It's important to me that my
people know where I came from.

04:54.165 --> 04:57.034
So, the D.A. wants
my job, Frank.

04:57.035 --> 04:59.736
As ambitious as
Charley Rossellini is,

04:59.737 --> 05:01.238
I wasn't sure he'd settle

05:01.239 --> 05:03.206
for anything less
than the White House.

05:03.207 --> 05:05.959
Well, he's got his sights
set on City Hall first.

05:05.960 --> 05:09.112
I mean, he-he's formed a PAC,
and his first deputy's

05:09.113 --> 05:11.915
about to resign to run
his campaign, so... right?

05:11.916 --> 05:14.017
He's been a pretty
strong D.A.

05:14.886 --> 05:15.953
Uh-huh.

05:15.954 --> 05:18.338
But, now, is that code
for "popular D.A."?

05:18.339 --> 05:21.758
Because my polls say
there is no more popular

05:21.759 --> 05:24.995
public figure in New York
than you, Frank.

05:24.996 --> 05:27.197
I won't be running for mayor.

05:27.198 --> 05:29.620
No, but I hope that you'll be

05:29.645 --> 05:31.321
standing shoulder
to shoulder with me.

05:31.703 --> 05:35.005
Now my office will coordinate
a series of joint appearances,

05:35.006 --> 05:36.907
and I thought maybe
we could kick it off

05:36.908 --> 05:39.995
with a formal announcement
on the steps of City Hall.

05:39.996 --> 05:41.506
I mean, I have to tell you
that no one looks better

05:41.579 --> 05:43.046
in a uniform
than you, Frank.

05:44.749 --> 05:46.667
I don't do politics.

05:46.668 --> 05:47.751
Right.

05:47.752 --> 05:50.037
Um, uh, let me be clear.

05:50.038 --> 05:51.654
Because, you see,
I don't give a damn

05:51.655 --> 05:54.458
how many "true blue" speeches
Rossellini makes at the PBA Dinner Dance

05:54.459 --> 05:56.159
with you and your pals,

05:56.160 --> 05:57.527
you work for me.

05:57.528 --> 06:01.164
I serve at your pleasure,
Mr. Mayor,

06:01.165 --> 06:04.968
but I <i>work</i> for
the people of New York City.

06:14.979 --> 06:16.229
Mr. Torres, have a seat.

06:16.230 --> 06:18.415
I'm Erin Reagan-Boyle,
assistant D.A.

06:18.416 --> 06:20.851
And I am
a high school math teacher.

06:20.852 --> 06:22.352
What am I doing here?

06:22.353 --> 06:24.687
It seems you made a deal
with the devil.

06:24.688 --> 06:26.723
I'm afraid your bill
has come due.

We started with four students.

Now we have over one hundred
from grades five to 12

06:57.810 --> 06:58.977

06:58.978 --> 07:01.313
And how do you pay
for the center?

07:01.314 --> 07:02.548
The building, your staff,

07:02.549 --> 07:03.982
the operating
expenses.

07:03.983 --> 07:06.818
Got a grant as part of a pilot
program from the Board of Ed

07:06.819 --> 07:08.320
and money from
several foundations.

07:08.321 --> 07:10.556
That was before the recession--
that money's dried up.

07:10.557 --> 07:12.791
You were desperate
to keep your project going.

07:12.792 --> 07:15.294
We were just starting
to see results.

07:15.295 --> 07:16.495
So you went to your brother.

07:16.496 --> 07:19.731
It was only a bridge loan,
to keep the doors open.

07:19.732 --> 07:22.734
That was two years ago-- he's
been bankrolling you ever since.

07:22.735 --> 07:25.203
What,
you want to arrest him for that?

07:25.204 --> 07:27.673
The most positive, generous
thing he has ever done.

07:27.674 --> 07:32.177
Maybe you need to be reminded on
how gangsters make their money.

07:34.881 --> 07:37.582
Richie Gonzales.
He didn't need that cane

07:37.583 --> 07:40.218
before your brother decided
to become his business partner.

07:40.219 --> 07:42.271
George Morales.

07:42.272 --> 07:44.256
He refused to pay

07:44.257 --> 07:45.557
protection money.

07:45.558 --> 07:48.060
Beaten so badly
he's lost sight in one eye.

07:48.061 --> 07:51.229
The corpse of Claude Eboue.

07:51.230 --> 07:52.364
He disrespected Pablo

07:52.365 --> 07:54.366
by driving his cab
on the same street

07:54.367 --> 07:56.568
that Pablo was relieving himself...
All right, stop.

07:56.569 --> 07:58.704
Do you understand that
your brother does not get a pass

07:58.705 --> 07:59.972
for buying you
erasers and pencils?

07:59.973 --> 08:02.207
Do <i>you</i> understand...
that I would never testify

08:02.208 --> 08:03.608
against my brother?

08:05.378 --> 08:08.280
We're here.

08:10.116 --> 08:11.616
All right.

08:11.617 --> 08:14.002
Whew! We got a fresh one.

08:14.003 --> 08:16.555
A high of 97
predicted for today.

08:16.556 --> 08:17.973
Indian summer.

08:19.459 --> 08:21.793
When you say
"fresh one"...

08:21.794 --> 08:23.862
Mrs. Muller, 91.

08:23.863 --> 08:26.765
Died with a can
of tuna fish in her hand.

08:26.766 --> 08:27.933
So listen up, rookie.

08:27.934 --> 08:30.369
You will remain on post
until such time

08:30.370 --> 08:32.270
as the M.E. gets
his lard-assed humps

08:32.270 --> 08:33.355
to do their job.

08:33.356 --> 08:35.240
How long does that
usually take?

08:35.241 --> 08:36.991
For the body to decompose?

08:36.993 --> 08:38.827
No, for the MLI to show up.

08:38.828 --> 08:39.995
I don't know,

08:39.996 --> 08:41.746
the over-and-under's
about five hours.

08:47.754 --> 08:49.755
You're taking the over,
though, right?

08:49.756 --> 08:52.341
3-B. Get the lead out.

08:53.226 --> 08:55.210
Come on.

09:01.234 --> 09:05.220
Frank, that daughter
of yours, she's a pistol.

09:05.221 --> 09:09.408
You didn't parachute
in here to tell me that.

09:09.409 --> 09:11.143
Frank, can I be candid?

09:11.144 --> 09:12.844
And brief, I hope.

09:12.845 --> 09:14.479
What our polling shows...

09:14.480 --> 09:17.282
if the election was tomorrow
I'd kick his butt.

09:17.283 --> 09:19.251
Good luck to you.

09:19.252 --> 09:22.054
You would not necessarily
be out of a job

09:22.055 --> 09:23.755
in a Rossellini administration.

09:23.756 --> 09:26.124
I appreciate the
vote of confidence.

09:26.125 --> 09:29.261
I don't expect an outright
endorsement, Frank, just...

09:29.262 --> 09:32.097
put some distance between
you and that empty suit.

09:32.098 --> 09:33.999
Thanks for stopping by, Charley.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.401
You know,
I had ten years on the job

09:36.402 --> 09:37.769
before I finished law school.

09:37.770 --> 09:40.105
I think I understand the
pressures on New York's finest

09:40.106 --> 09:43.058
better than some Westside
baby-kisser ever will.

09:43.059 --> 09:45.210
When you were in the bag,
you were already

09:45.211 --> 09:46.978
more politician than cop,
Charley.

09:47.747 --> 09:50.098
Good news.

09:50.099 --> 09:52.884
Erin's got quite a career
ahead of her.

09:52.885 --> 09:55.687
You're too smart to use
my daughter for leverage.

09:55.688 --> 09:57.572
I'm smart enough
to know that your mayor

09:57.573 --> 09:59.925
is gonna have problems
next year.

09:59.926 --> 10:03.795
Last thing I want is for you
to be collateral damage.

10:10.770 --> 10:12.938
Okay, Esteban, think about it.

10:12.939 --> 10:15.173
I need an answer by
the end of the day.

10:15.174 --> 10:19.344
Is that when I get
my 30 pieces of silver?

10:22.548 --> 10:25.016
Mr. Torres,
I understand that this is

10:25.017 --> 10:27.135
an emotional decision for you.

10:27.136 --> 10:28.587
Maybe there's a way that

10:28.588 --> 10:31.189
you won't have to take
the stand in open court.

10:31.190 --> 10:32.491
Really?

10:32.492 --> 10:34.760
You could testify
before the grand jury--

10:34.761 --> 10:35.994
it's a secret proceeding.

10:35.995 --> 10:38.263
Your brother would
never have to know.

10:38.264 --> 10:41.333
I cannot stab Pablo
in the back like that.

10:41.334 --> 10:43.435
<i>If</i> I do this...

10:43.436 --> 10:45.504
I have to tell him first.

10:45.505 --> 10:46.872
I don't think
that's a good idea.

10:46.873 --> 10:49.875
Pablo got jumped into
the Webster Avenue Boys at 11.

10:49.876 --> 10:52.544
They wanted me, too,
but Pablo backed them off.

10:52.545 --> 10:55.547
Made sure I got to school,
made sure I got home safe.

10:55.548 --> 10:58.383
Anything I've been able
to accomplish I owe to him.

10:58.384 --> 10:59.985
He's a dangerous man.

10:59.986 --> 11:02.487
Have you considered
how he might react?

11:02.488 --> 11:05.357
Do you really think
I have more to fear

11:05.358 --> 11:08.160
from my own brother
than from you?

11:14.167 --> 11:16.101
He shoots. He scores!

11:16.102 --> 11:17.135
Oh!

11:17.136 --> 11:20.372
What a shot. What a pass.

11:22.408 --> 11:26.311
What's wrong?
You lost your appetite?

11:28.114 --> 11:30.348
You look like you seen a
dead person or something.

11:31.450 --> 11:32.817
What, you put Renzulli up to it?

11:32.818 --> 11:34.119
Come on.

11:34.120 --> 11:35.987
When's Renzulli ever
listened to anything I say?

11:35.988 --> 11:37.389
I had to burn
that uniform.

11:37.390 --> 11:40.292
Hey. The rookie gets
the short stick on the job

11:40.293 --> 11:41.626
since back before
I came on.

11:41.627 --> 11:43.678
Yeah, speaking of
sticks, Grandpa,

11:43.679 --> 11:45.630
I offered Jamie your
old blackjack, too.

11:45.631 --> 11:46.598
My old slapper?

11:46.599 --> 11:48.033
Mm-hmm.

11:48.034 --> 11:49.134
I'd take that
as a compliment.

11:49.135 --> 11:50.335
Yeah. He turned
it down.

11:50.336 --> 11:52.337
It's not 1959, Pop.

11:52.338 --> 11:53.972
That's 1969,

11:53.973 --> 11:55.040
thank you
very much, Francis.

11:55.041 --> 11:56.341
They're not authorized.

11:56.342 --> 11:58.076
Doesn't mean it can't
save your life.

11:58.077 --> 11:58.944
That's all right.

11:58.945 --> 12:00.395
Let him learn the hard way.

12:00.396 --> 12:01.913
When he's rolling around
in the dirt with 300 pounds

12:01.914 --> 12:04.249
of prison muscle.
I never carried one.

12:04.250 --> 12:06.618
Come on, Dad. You're six foot,
four. You got hands of stone.

12:06.619 --> 12:08.687
I still remember
spankings I got from you

12:08.688 --> 12:10.155
with those war clubs.

12:10.156 --> 12:12.123
You gave me plenty of chances.

12:12.124 --> 12:13.542
Justify it any way
you want.

12:13.543 --> 12:14.743
Everybody
in this room knows

12:14.744 --> 12:16.061
when those things did
most of their damage--

12:16.062 --> 12:17.195
after the perp
was cuffed.

12:17.196 --> 12:19.030
What?

12:19.031 --> 12:20.632
What am I going
to do with you?

12:20.633 --> 12:21.733
Hmm?

12:21.734 --> 12:23.752
How am I going to teach
this kid the ropes?

12:23.753 --> 12:25.303
You got a problem with me
when I'm a dumb rookie,

12:25.304 --> 12:26.972
and a problem when I'm not.
Why is that?

12:54.500 --> 12:56.751
♪ ♪

12:58.871 --> 13:02.874
<i>We've got both image and sound</i>
<i>inside the church.</i>

13:02.875 --> 13:04.843
What if Pablo goes off?

13:04.844 --> 13:06.745
Four from our squad
are in position

13:06.746 --> 13:08.647
to take him down
at my command.

13:34.073 --> 13:36.241
I didn't hear
you come in.

13:36.242 --> 13:38.810
What can I say, bro?

13:38.811 --> 13:41.713
Sneaking up on folks
is in my bones, right?

13:45.418 --> 13:47.552
It's been a while
since we sat here, man.

13:47.553 --> 13:48.787
Yeah.

13:48.788 --> 13:50.355
What's the
matter, bro?

13:50.356 --> 13:53.191
You can't talk
at school?

13:55.227 --> 13:57.429
Steban?

13:57.430 --> 13:59.831
You in trouble, man?
Don't tell me.

13:59.832 --> 14:02.233
It's one of these fine young
tutors in the short skirts?

14:02.234 --> 14:03.835
You got in trouble?
No, no.

14:03.836 --> 14:05.003
You got in trouble?
No.

14:05.004 --> 14:06.905
It's nothing like that.

14:06.906 --> 14:08.807
What is it?

14:08.808 --> 14:10.208
It's the money.

14:10.209 --> 14:12.177
You need more? Come on.

14:12.178 --> 14:14.245
No. No, no, no. No, no.

14:14.246 --> 14:16.014
The D.A.

14:16.015 --> 14:17.782
She's on to it.

14:17.783 --> 14:20.151
She wants to
shut me down.

14:27.793 --> 14:30.211
So...

14:31.547 --> 14:35.166
This D.A. is gonna foreclose
on the kids

14:35.167 --> 14:37.068
to strike a blow at me?

14:37.069 --> 14:39.504
She wants me
to testify against you.

14:43.142 --> 14:46.945
I'm ashamed of myself
for even thinking about it.

14:46.946 --> 14:48.847
I mean, all these years
you've looked out for me,

14:48.848 --> 14:52.117
kept me alive.

14:52.118 --> 14:56.054
No.

14:56.055 --> 14:58.156
You tell her okay.

14:58.157 --> 15:00.225
Tell her, take her shot.

15:00.226 --> 15:01.359
I'm right here.

15:02.461 --> 15:05.864
Let my <i>abogado</i> work
for his money, huh?

15:05.865 --> 15:08.099
What?

15:08.100 --> 15:09.634
How about that?

15:11.737 --> 15:13.505
I think...

15:13.506 --> 15:15.974
maybe I should be
more ashamed of this,

15:15.975 --> 15:17.909
and you less.

15:17.910 --> 15:21.513
You do what you
got to do, man.

15:21.514 --> 15:24.616
'Cause you in jail?

15:26.718 --> 15:28.620
I-I don't see it, man.

15:28.621 --> 15:29.771
I mean,
what are you going to do,

15:29.772 --> 15:32.957
teach the convicts
six times seven?

15:32.958 --> 15:35.126
But me?

15:37.329 --> 15:39.914
I can jail as strong
as anybody, man.

15:42.401 --> 15:44.569
I'll do a nickel
like it's a weekend in Rikers.

15:44.570 --> 15:46.971
It's not like she's got
a body on me or nothing, man.

15:46.972 --> 15:48.740
Yeah, but I take the stand,

15:48.741 --> 15:50.408
and how can you make this
right on the street?

15:50.409 --> 15:52.010
I'm still me.

15:52.011 --> 15:55.914
None of those baby gangsters
want to throw down with Pablo.

15:55.915 --> 15:58.083
Come on.

16:02.388 --> 16:04.456
I don't know what to say.

16:04.457 --> 16:06.758
Nothing to say, man.

16:06.759 --> 16:09.160
Look, you made a life, bro.

16:09.161 --> 16:11.062
Right?

16:11.063 --> 16:12.897
And you're doing the same
by those kids.

16:12.898 --> 16:15.967
I'm the last homie
to take that away from you, man.

16:22.291 --> 16:24.775
Be easy, bro.

16:51.906 --> 16:53.874
No, I understand. Yeah.

16:54.856 --> 16:56.502
I've got something for you.

16:56.503 --> 16:57.953
I hope it's
Junior's cheesecake.

16:57.954 --> 17:00.172
I got to go.

17:01.791 --> 17:03.642
Doesn't look like
Junior's cheesecake to me.

17:03.643 --> 17:06.095
I think the time is right
to walk these open cases

17:06.096 --> 17:07.311
back to Pablo Torres.

17:07.313 --> 17:10.182
You got your own squad
on Center Street. Why me?

17:10.183 --> 17:13.935
My guys are good, but they're
understaffed by 50 percent,

17:13.936 --> 17:16.088
and burning through overtime to
make the case we already have.

17:16.089 --> 17:17.089
I'm not interested.

17:17.089 --> 17:20.025
I just had Esteban Torres

17:20.026 --> 17:22.493
in front of the grand jury.

17:22.494 --> 17:24.797
Seeing what it's costing him...

17:24.798 --> 17:26.598
He got to you, didn't he?

17:28.068 --> 17:30.069
The Iron Maiden.

17:30.070 --> 17:32.955
Look, I'll do
whatever I have to do

17:32.956 --> 17:35.674
to send him upstate,
but if there's another way...

17:35.675 --> 17:36.992
Let me see.

17:36.993 --> 17:40.045
Three strongest cases against
Pablo and his wrecking crew.

17:40.046 --> 17:41.964
Until they blew
out my witnesses.

17:41.965 --> 17:44.299
You got something that's not
a complete waste of my time?

17:44.300 --> 17:46.284
Louie Suarez. He was my
best murder witness,

17:46.285 --> 17:47.820
until Pablo got to him.

17:47.821 --> 17:50.155
Louie's in the wind, but
if we can charge Pablo

17:50.156 --> 17:53.425
with money laundering
and witness intimidation,

17:53.426 --> 17:55.127
we can indict him on
a Class A felony.

17:55.128 --> 17:57.312
Put him away for 15 years,
instead of three.

17:57.313 --> 17:59.898
A two-Reagan task force?

18:02.368 --> 18:04.570
Why not?

18:12.078 --> 18:14.196
She looks great.

18:16.416 --> 18:19.218
Joe worked two jobs that summer
for the extra money.

18:19.219 --> 18:21.920
Found the engine in Rochester.
Thanks.

18:21.921 --> 18:23.755
Yep. Restored it
from the ground up.

18:23.756 --> 18:26.024
Yeah.

18:26.025 --> 18:29.695
I never could figure out
why he loved this car so.

18:29.696 --> 18:31.763
He wasn't even born
when I bought it.

18:31.764 --> 18:34.566
Number one, it's
an awesome car.

18:34.567 --> 18:37.069
Number Two, it was your car.

18:37.070 --> 18:40.939
None of us wanted to be
more like you than Joe did.

18:40.940 --> 18:44.176
I saw Joe's girl
Angela a while back.

18:44.177 --> 18:46.344
She's moving back
to Portland.

18:46.345 --> 18:48.313
Really?

18:49.149 --> 18:51.183
You missed a spot.

18:55.889 --> 18:58.073
That night...

18:58.074 --> 19:01.960
To me, it's like
a movie in my head,

19:01.961 --> 19:03.629
but with deleted scenes.

19:03.630 --> 19:05.797
Joe was hitting a
location, right?

19:05.798 --> 19:07.299
Brooklyn South.

19:07.300 --> 19:09.034
Just like dozens
of other times?

19:09.035 --> 19:12.538
Yeah.

19:12.539 --> 19:16.008
Except, this time,
the perp rabbited.

19:16.009 --> 19:18.877
Joe could run.

19:18.878 --> 19:21.980
Chased this guy down.

19:21.981 --> 19:25.584
Another perp
comes out of nowhere,

19:25.585 --> 19:29.221
and shoots Joe. Four times.

19:29.222 --> 19:30.555
And the two perps?

19:30.556 --> 19:31.757
What do you think?

19:31.758 --> 19:33.392
Our guys returned fire.

19:33.393 --> 19:35.961
Dead at the scene.

19:35.962 --> 19:37.930
The Warrant Squad's
a great unit.

19:37.931 --> 19:40.933
Strong team,

19:40.934 --> 19:43.001
early tours, a lot of overtime.

19:43.002 --> 19:46.138
But every time you hit a door,

19:46.139 --> 19:48.407
you need an angel
on your shoulder.

19:50.410 --> 19:53.145
You should have the car.

19:53.146 --> 19:56.014
Take her home.

19:58.818 --> 20:02.221
Since I became
police commissioner,

20:02.222 --> 20:04.790
they drive me everywhere.

20:21.457 --> 20:23.242
Omar Vasquez?

20:24.043 --> 20:25.544
Can we ask you
some questions?

20:25.545 --> 20:26.411
About what?

20:26.412 --> 20:27.913
About Louie Suarez.

20:27.914 --> 20:29.281
He don't work for me no more.

20:29.282 --> 20:30.332
Yeah, well, he's a witness

20:30.333 --> 20:31.550
in a murder investigation.

20:31.551 --> 20:33.135
Yeah? Well,
that's bad business

20:33.136 --> 20:34.286
on Webster Avenue.

20:34.287 --> 20:35.921
Maybe he got some
career counseling.

20:35.922 --> 20:37.889
Yeah? From who, Pablo Torres?

20:40.476 --> 20:42.261
Yo, everybody
knows about Pablo.

20:42.262 --> 20:43.228
Why you gotta ask me?

20:43.229 --> 20:44.730
Because he came
to your fruit stand

20:44.731 --> 20:45.931
gunning for Louie Suarez.

20:45.932 --> 20:47.099
Nah, he don't.

20:47.100 --> 20:49.735
No? 19 stitches
in the side of your head

20:49.736 --> 20:50.936
at Montefiore don't lie.

20:50.937 --> 20:52.404
Not Pablo.

20:52.405 --> 20:54.306
It was his little <i>pistolero</i>
Grumpy.

20:54.307 --> 20:56.174
He put the cannon
upside my head.

20:56.175 --> 20:58.810
Big gun?
Chrome .45.

20:58.811 --> 21:00.078
Look even bigger pointed at you.

21:00.079 --> 21:01.997
Thanks for your time.

21:03.866 --> 21:06.485
You gonna pay
for that?

21:18.131 --> 21:19.548
Hi, Angie.

21:19.549 --> 21:21.500
It's good to see you.
Yeah.

21:23.169 --> 21:24.502
How soon do you leave?

21:24.503 --> 21:27.572
Tomorrow.
I have so much left to do.

21:27.573 --> 21:28.974
I won't stay long.

21:33.246 --> 21:36.348
I used to love this city.

21:38.351 --> 21:42.054
Picking up the Sunday
<i>Times</i> after a night out,

21:42.055 --> 21:44.873
more people on Second Avenue
at 3:00 a.m.

21:44.874 --> 21:46.425
than in Portland
during rush hour.

21:46.426 --> 21:47.926
Why are you going?

21:47.927 --> 21:50.962
Same reason you became a cop.

21:56.703 --> 21:59.571
The night that Joe, um...

21:59.572 --> 22:02.207
the last night,

22:02.208 --> 22:05.110
before he went out,
did he seem worried?

22:05.111 --> 22:06.678
Did he say anything?

22:06.679 --> 22:10.148
I have no answers for you.

22:11.951 --> 22:14.052
But I did find a box
of Joe's things

22:14.053 --> 22:15.987
in the closet
while I was packing.

22:17.857 --> 22:20.992
If you want them.

22:20.993 --> 22:22.194
Yeah.

22:25.998 --> 22:27.966
Good luck to you, Jamie.

22:27.967 --> 22:31.303
Thanks. You, too.

22:41.414 --> 22:44.616
So the school teacher came
through before the grand jury.

22:44.617 --> 22:45.751
Yup, here's the warrant.

22:45.752 --> 22:47.219
Safety first, okay?

22:47.220 --> 22:49.821
I don't care how Pablo
came across to his brother.

22:49.822 --> 22:51.523
He's a gangster
with bodies on him.

22:51.524 --> 22:52.758
Our TAC plan is solid.

22:52.759 --> 22:53.925
Go over it again.

22:53.926 --> 22:55.310
Every time you hit a door...

22:55.311 --> 22:57.662
We'll hit the club like
he's Carlos the Jackal.

23:23.122 --> 23:25.290
Reagan.

23:27.260 --> 23:30.228
The night his brother testifies?

23:31.798 --> 23:33.765
Find Esteban,
get him off the street.

23:33.766 --> 23:36.601
Whoever killed Pablo's probably
gunning for him next.

23:48.414 --> 23:50.582
I'm sorry, Esteban.

23:54.353 --> 23:56.388
Who killed him?

23:56.389 --> 23:58.423
We don't know yet.

23:58.424 --> 24:00.525
But we'll find them.

24:03.029 --> 24:05.197
I know.

24:06.032 --> 24:08.133
I killed him...

24:08.134 --> 24:10.335
when I listened to you.

24:22.148 --> 24:25.183
Don't turn this on yourself.

24:25.184 --> 24:28.386
You told me the grand jury
was secret.

24:28.387 --> 24:32.123
It is. We have no reason
to believe there was a leak.

24:33.626 --> 24:35.794
Pablo knew we were
coming for him.

24:35.795 --> 24:39.030
He needed
to put his affairs in order.

24:41.067 --> 24:43.535
He was trying to protect me.

24:43.536 --> 24:46.538
So he told those bastards
he gave me permission.

24:59.398 --> 24:59.430
Thanks.

25:00.716 --> 25:02.467
No forced entry,
no signs of struggle.

25:02.468 --> 25:03.751
Thank you.

25:03.958 --> 25:06.093
His people got to
him before we could.

25:06.094 --> 25:07.361
Looks that way.

25:07.362 --> 25:10.164
Wow. Two to the back
of the head.

25:10.165 --> 25:11.965
Solitaire hand on the table.

25:11.966 --> 25:13.667
Coffee machine is on.

25:13.668 --> 25:16.670
Pablo sits here dealing, tells
one of his punks to get him

25:16.671 --> 25:18.522
a cafecito, catches
lead instead.

25:18.523 --> 25:20.474
Boom.

25:20.475 --> 25:24.044
Calls all his boys together,
sits on his thrown,

25:24.045 --> 25:25.329
silver crown
around his neck.

25:25.330 --> 25:27.748
Yeah, silver crown
around his neck which is...

25:27.749 --> 25:29.917
no longer there.

25:30.985 --> 25:34.455
So he tells his crew,
"I got to go upstate for a pop,

25:34.456 --> 25:35.622
"but I'm still the king,

25:35.623 --> 25:37.541
"and Esteban is still
my little brother.

25:37.542 --> 25:40.660
"And anybody so much
as breathes hot sauce on him,

25:40.661 --> 25:41.945
I'll snatch their life."

25:41.946 --> 25:44.097
They see that as weakness.
Yup.

25:44.098 --> 25:46.166
As if Pablo
was a snitch himself.

25:46.167 --> 25:50.237
Okay, so then, why
leave the body here?

25:50.238 --> 25:51.838
In their own spot?

25:51.839 --> 25:53.607
Send a message.

25:53.608 --> 25:55.776
The king is dead.

25:56.978 --> 25:58.445
Did you double-check?

25:58.446 --> 26:01.448
We've had a pole cam up on
that location for nine months.

26:01.449 --> 26:03.584
And it <i>was</i> running
last night.

26:03.585 --> 26:07.120
We could already have
that shooter on tape.

26:08.356 --> 26:11.408
I had my techs upload the link
directly from the pole.

26:12.544 --> 26:15.496
This camera covers the club
where Pablo was murdered.

26:16.631 --> 26:18.699
There.

26:18.700 --> 26:20.868
Can you move in
on those faces?

26:25.540 --> 26:26.706
Hey, run that back.

26:26.707 --> 26:27.808
Run that back.

26:27.809 --> 26:29.876
Are you showing off
for your kid sister?

26:29.877 --> 26:31.044
No. What was that?

26:31.045 --> 26:33.547
There.

26:33.548 --> 26:36.016
What?
That flick of light right there.

26:36.017 --> 26:38.068
There. There.

26:38.069 --> 26:40.854
Yeah. It's on his waist band.

26:40.855 --> 26:43.056
Chrome .45.

26:43.057 --> 26:46.159
Grumpy's most
prized possession.

27:02.377 --> 27:04.711
Hey! Police!

27:12.420 --> 27:14.388
Police! Don't move!

27:15.490 --> 27:17.090
Get down on the
ground now!

27:21.896 --> 27:23.730
Easy, kid.

27:23.731 --> 27:26.900
A bad day for you
is just a punch line for me.

27:28.236 --> 27:30.654
Hey, Syd,
are we still on for dinner?

27:30.655 --> 27:32.539
Bad news, sweetie.

27:32.540 --> 27:34.474
The partner just called
and told me

27:34.475 --> 27:37.377
I have a 500-page deposition
to finish tonight.

27:37.378 --> 27:40.047
Ugh! Sounds like
an all-nighter to me.

27:40.048 --> 27:44.051
If I do get out of there,
can I wake you up when I get in?

27:44.052 --> 27:46.953
Better wake me up,
or there will be consequences.

27:48.556 --> 27:50.457
You're the light
at the end of my tunnel.

27:50.458 --> 27:51.625
Love you.

27:51.626 --> 27:53.810
Me, too. Bye.

28:33.735 --> 28:36.370
Testing. Testing.

28:36.371 --> 28:38.405
This is Detective Joseph Reagan.

28:38.406 --> 28:42.059
Six months into my investigation
of the Blue Templar.

28:42.060 --> 28:44.811
Big meet tomorrow.

28:44.812 --> 28:46.513
I think I'm in.

28:46.514 --> 28:50.350
My FBI contact was changed
without explanation.

28:50.351 --> 28:53.453
I-I don't know
if they can be trusted.

28:53.454 --> 28:56.757
I make this record separate
from my recordings for them.

28:56.758 --> 28:59.092
More after tomorrow.

29:02.530 --> 29:05.382
We play by my rules
in here, okay?

29:05.383 --> 29:09.386
So, no more games, and no
street names, Israel Beltran.

29:09.387 --> 29:11.972
I ask you a question, if
you're smart, you answer it.

29:11.973 --> 29:14.341
Why am I gonna talk to you?
You ain't my lawyer.

29:14.342 --> 29:16.510
I hope you got a good lawyer,
because, uh,

29:16.511 --> 29:19.146
we got you coming out
of the social club on tape

29:19.147 --> 29:20.681
with your big shiny
penis extension.

29:20.682 --> 29:23.600
Ballistics just tied the gun
to your BFF Pablo.

29:23.601 --> 29:25.252
You're done.

29:25.253 --> 29:27.287
You know, I got 20
bucks says that, uh,

29:27.288 --> 29:28.855
when Ballistics runs that gun
through IBIS,

29:28.856 --> 29:30.190
old Grumpy here,

29:30.191 --> 29:31.658
he's probably gonna be
good for another unsolved

29:31.659 --> 29:33.076
homicide, too.
What do you think, hmm?

29:33.077 --> 29:34.611
I don't want any
part of that bet.

29:34.612 --> 29:39.199
So, uh, the only lawyer
that can help you now

29:39.200 --> 29:40.300
sits at our table.

29:40.301 --> 29:41.368
That's right.

29:41.369 --> 29:43.170
So, you can give a statement
to the A.D.A.,

29:43.171 --> 29:45.639
helping her to understand what
you and your homies are up to,

29:45.640 --> 29:47.507
and if you're lucky, maybe
you'll see the streets again

29:47.508 --> 29:49.710
by the time you're 50.
You want my statement?

29:49.711 --> 29:50.744
That's what I just said.

29:50.745 --> 29:53.580
We run Webster Avenue, not you.

29:53.581 --> 29:56.450
Any snitch is a dead snitch.

29:56.451 --> 29:58.418
Whether it's the King
of New York,

29:58.419 --> 30:00.787
or some teacher in a school,
whatever.

30:00.788 --> 30:03.590
It's just another guest star
on our no-snitching video.

30:07.729 --> 30:10.564
Esteban is our witness.
We need to protect him.

30:10.565 --> 30:11.965
Our witness in what case?

30:11.966 --> 30:13.333
His brother's dead.

30:13.334 --> 30:14.935
The murder suspect
is brazen enough

30:14.936 --> 30:17.370
to threaten his life in
front of two detectives.

30:17.371 --> 30:18.989
That sounds like
trash talk to me.

30:18.990 --> 30:21.875
Look, our limited resources
should be devoted

30:21.876 --> 30:23.543
to cases
we can actually prosecute.

30:23.544 --> 30:25.612
How will we ever get
anyone to cooperate

30:25.613 --> 30:27.447
if we turn our back
on Esteban now?

30:27.448 --> 30:30.050
You know, Reagan,
I liked you better

30:30.051 --> 30:32.419
as my ninja assassin
than my guilty conscience.

30:32.420 --> 30:33.587
With all due respect, sir,

30:33.588 --> 30:35.989
I would hate to see you
make the wrong call.

30:35.990 --> 30:38.825
Especially in a
no-stink-bomb year.

30:38.826 --> 30:41.895
Sure you don't have
any Sicilian blood in there?

30:45.133 --> 30:47.134
Look, <i>if</i>

30:47.135 --> 30:50.103
he has any actually useful
information about this gang,

30:50.104 --> 30:53.306
and <i>if</i> he's willing to come in
and play with our team

30:53.307 --> 30:55.742
on a permanent basis...
I'll see what we can do.

30:55.743 --> 30:57.144
Good-bye.

31:01.282 --> 31:03.650
You think this is the first
time I've been threatened?

31:03.651 --> 31:05.318
- Circumstances have changed.
- That's right.

31:05.319 --> 31:07.454
Pablo's not here
to get my back.

31:07.455 --> 31:09.673
My office can protect you
starting right now.

31:09.674 --> 31:11.525
If I turn full-time
snitch, do you really think

31:11.526 --> 31:12.959
I can do my work
after that?

31:12.960 --> 31:15.729
There are so many places
that need a dedicated teacher...

31:15.730 --> 31:17.881
But this is my home.

31:21.102 --> 31:24.137
Please, Mr. Torres, help me
bring these men to justice.

31:24.138 --> 31:27.073
Pablo was the avenger.

31:27.074 --> 31:28.608
My way is to endure.

31:28.609 --> 31:31.845
I'm not going to
testify against the gang.

31:33.648 --> 31:35.682
Hi, Grandpa.

31:35.683 --> 31:37.818
Hey.

31:37.819 --> 31:40.053
What's that smell?

31:40.054 --> 31:42.589
Trial run for
Sunday dinner.

31:42.590 --> 31:44.391
It's duck.

31:44.392 --> 31:45.625
Burnt duck.

31:45.626 --> 31:46.877
I like it crispy.

31:50.748 --> 31:52.799
Where's Dad?
He's not home yet?

31:52.800 --> 31:56.219
He said he had
an important call to make.

32:01.275 --> 32:03.543
Anything I can help you with?

32:04.378 --> 32:06.880
My witness is

32:06.881 --> 32:08.615
refusing to testify.

32:08.616 --> 32:11.518
His life is in danger,
and he's refusing protection.

32:11.519 --> 32:14.621
So, what do I do,
just sit back and pretend

32:14.622 --> 32:16.756
that I don't know
what's going to happen?

32:16.757 --> 32:19.025
Hmm.

32:19.026 --> 32:22.329
Back when I was
captain of the 6-5

32:22.330 --> 32:24.598
and your father
was a detective,

32:24.599 --> 32:27.067
we had a mob shooting,

32:27.068 --> 32:31.004
and one of the busboys at
Patsy's was a witness.

32:31.005 --> 32:36.076
Now, the mob guys put so
much pressure on this kid,

32:36.077 --> 32:38.078
he refused
to testify.

32:38.079 --> 32:41.448
He signed the form
declining police protection.

32:41.449 --> 32:44.384
Now, your father took that
form, put it in his pocket,

32:44.385 --> 32:47.387
and then went to live
with this guy for a week.

32:47.388 --> 32:50.156
And when the
torpedo showed up,

32:50.157 --> 32:53.026
Francis threw him down
three flights of stairs.

32:54.362 --> 32:57.664
You think the busboy
refused to testify after that?

33:01.619 --> 33:04.170
It's a Reagan tradition--
be ready.

33:04.171 --> 33:07.207
Before the inevitable happens.

33:07.208 --> 33:08.241
Yeah.

33:11.612 --> 33:12.612
Reagan.

33:12.613 --> 33:13.747
It's your father.

33:13.748 --> 33:15.282
Commissioner.

33:15.283 --> 33:17.150
Oh, you're worried about Erin.

33:17.151 --> 33:18.218
Well, concerned.

33:18.219 --> 33:20.670
She put a lot of herself
into this one.

33:20.671 --> 33:22.222
Well, she's put me into it, too,

33:22.223 --> 33:24.758
and I don't work for the D.A.,
last I checked.

33:24.759 --> 33:26.326
I had a thought.

33:26.327 --> 33:28.561
After a kingpin
gets knocked off,

33:28.562 --> 33:29.829
there's a power vacuum.

33:29.830 --> 33:31.665
His lieutenants
fight for position.

33:31.666 --> 33:33.466
Well, Esteban's scalp
is the prize.

33:33.467 --> 33:34.935
With Grumpy off the street,

33:34.936 --> 33:36.836
I'm kind of liking
his partner, Chavo.

33:36.837 --> 33:39.105
Well... if Chavo made his move

33:39.106 --> 33:41.942
at the time and place
of <i>our</i> choosing...

33:42.810 --> 33:45.612
I think I can make that happen.

33:46.447 --> 33:48.715
You and Jamie okay?

33:48.716 --> 33:49.716
We're fine, Dad.

33:49.717 --> 33:52.369
Good.
All right.

34:04.432 --> 34:06.366
New phone?

34:06.367 --> 34:08.635
It's Grumpy's phone.

34:08.636 --> 34:10.353
You know Grumpy's, uh,
he's pretty desperate

34:10.353 --> 34:12.938
to get a message to
his boys right now.

34:14.375 --> 34:16.643
And we do happen to have all
their numbers right here.

34:16.643 --> 34:19.179
Yeah, but he's in custody,
and his boys know that.

34:19.179 --> 34:20.313
Yeah, that's true.

34:20.313 --> 34:23.183
But, then again, he
could text them from...

34:23.184 --> 34:25.318
a phone like this,
which, you know,

34:25.319 --> 34:26.902
he could've gotten
from his lawyer.

34:26.904 --> 34:28.705
No, we patted him down--
his lawyers

34:28.706 --> 34:30.489
didn't...

34:33.793 --> 34:35.195
I mean, it's worth a try, right?

34:35.196 --> 34:37.263
Do you have search warrants
for those numbers?

34:37.264 --> 34:39.866
Do we have time
for search warrants?

34:39.867 --> 34:41.935
Do it.

34:45.806 --> 34:47.540
Let's try...

34:47.541 --> 34:50.476
Chavo. Okay.

34:53.813 --> 34:55.715
We'll see what happens.

34:55.716 --> 34:59.185
I got a text from Grumpy,
from jail.

34:59.186 --> 35:01.604
Yo, check this out, man.

35:07.495 --> 35:09.662
Did he buy it?
Let's see.

35:13.034 --> 35:14.667
My lawyer...

35:14.668 --> 35:16.403
hooked me up.

35:17.588 --> 35:19.406
We'll send a little more.

35:19.407 --> 35:21.941
Teacher...

35:21.942 --> 35:24.811
protective custody...

35:35.689 --> 35:37.924
Uh.

35:38.926 --> 35:41.027
Make the call
on the go.

35:41.028 --> 35:42.862
We're on.

35:49.052 --> 35:50.552
Let's shut this
snitch up for good!

36:51.629 --> 36:53.764
Shh, shh, shh. I'm a cop.

36:58.502 --> 37:00.437
Showtime.

37:00.438 --> 37:01.271
Hit 'em.

37:01.272 --> 37:02.522
Police! Drop your weapons!

37:02.523 --> 37:05.058
Down on the ground! Now!

37:05.059 --> 37:07.144
Hands in the air!

37:13.568 --> 37:15.535
Entrance clear!

37:15.536 --> 37:17.120
She sent you here?

37:17.121 --> 37:18.822
Yeah.

37:18.823 --> 37:20.791
We're not your baby-sitters.

37:20.792 --> 37:22.759
Next time you're on your own.

37:22.760 --> 37:25.796
And now she needs you
to testify.

37:26.831 --> 37:29.366
Somebody grab his gun.

37:31.269 --> 37:32.886
I'm starving.

37:32.887 --> 37:34.504
What's this?

37:34.505 --> 37:36.406
Duck.

37:36.407 --> 37:38.108
Can I have some ketchup, Mom?

37:41.212 --> 37:42.346
It's black.

37:42.347 --> 37:43.880
Listen, enough.

37:43.881 --> 37:44.815
Eat some beans.

37:44.816 --> 37:46.283
Any other comments?

37:46.284 --> 37:48.885
'Cause if all you're
gonna do is complain,

37:48.886 --> 37:50.854
I mean, we could just have
meat and potatoes

37:50.855 --> 37:52.723
for the rest of our lives.
No, Pop,

37:52.724 --> 37:54.591
it's fun for me and Erin
when somebody else cooks. Right?

37:54.592 --> 37:58.195
It's actually the first sit-down
meal of my week, so thank you.

37:58.196 --> 37:59.363
I'll second that.

37:59.364 --> 38:00.664
It was a good job

38:00.665 --> 38:02.599
taking down
those Webster Avenue Boys.

38:02.600 --> 38:04.501
Kind of a Pyrrhic victory,
though.

38:04.502 --> 38:06.403
Don't use these big words.
What does that mean?

38:06.404 --> 38:09.239
We got the bad guys, but the
learning center has to close.

38:09.240 --> 38:10.540
There's no funding.

38:10.541 --> 38:12.042
Well,
it's a bittersweet victory.

38:12.043 --> 38:14.111
Yes, bittersweet victory.
Mm, yeah.

38:14.112 --> 38:17.047
Mm-hmm. Well, nothing
bittersweet about my victory.

38:17.048 --> 38:18.382
Thank you for
the blackjack, Grandpa.

38:18.383 --> 38:20.017
And thank you for not using it,

38:20.018 --> 38:21.751
little brother,
it came in very handy.

38:21.752 --> 38:24.221
I just hope it doesn't get you
another I.A. investigation.

38:26.491 --> 38:27.491
What did you say?

38:27.492 --> 38:29.226
You heard me.
Here we go.

38:29.227 --> 38:30.727
No, I didn't hear you.
Say it again.

38:30.728 --> 38:31.995
Jamie, he's just trying to get

38:31.996 --> 38:33.397
a rise out of you.
Yeah, well, he got one.

38:33.398 --> 38:35.499
Yeah, listen to your girlfriend,
Jamie. Take it easy.

38:35.500 --> 38:37.200
I will, Danny,
when you get off my back,

38:37.201 --> 38:38.702
okay?
Hey, I'm not on your back.

38:38.703 --> 38:40.570
You've been riding me
ever since I got out of academy.

38:40.571 --> 38:42.739
You know, when I start riding
you, you'll know about it.

38:42.740 --> 38:43.874
Easy. Kids.

38:43.875 --> 38:45.175
Where you going? Hey.
I'm sick of this.

38:45.176 --> 38:48.245
Sit down.
You want to talk, Danny? Outside, okay?

38:48.246 --> 38:49.846
Where you going? Sit down.
You want to talk about this?

38:49.847 --> 38:52.582
- Sit down, Harvard!
- Outside, Danny.

39:00.258 --> 39:02.092
I'll go talk to him.

39:02.093 --> 39:03.427
I'll talk to him.

39:24.348 --> 39:26.249
Don't tell your mom.

39:29.954 --> 39:31.621
You pray, don't you?

39:31.622 --> 39:33.123
Don't tell your mom.

39:35.209 --> 39:37.043
I'm sorry, but...

39:37.044 --> 39:38.712
rookie this, rookie that.

39:38.713 --> 39:40.997
I mean, I can't do
anything right anymore. He...

39:40.998 --> 39:43.734
Well, I think he's desperate to
teach you everything he knows.

39:43.735 --> 39:45.051
By tearing me down

39:45.052 --> 39:46.570
every chance
that he gets?

39:46.571 --> 39:49.406
That's your brother.

39:49.407 --> 39:51.808
If Danny's tough on you...

39:51.809 --> 39:54.111
it's 'cause he wants
to make you bulletproof.

39:54.112 --> 39:57.748
I give directions
to tourists in Times Square.

39:57.749 --> 40:01.118
It's not exactly Fort
Apache in the '70s.

40:04.055 --> 40:05.872
Every tour you work,

40:05.873 --> 40:08.658
do this job like there's
trouble around every corner,

40:08.659 --> 40:11.128
'cause one day
there will be.

40:14.065 --> 40:17.100
Danny couldn't handle
losing another brother.

40:27.478 --> 40:29.262
Sit down, Charley.

40:29.263 --> 40:32.265
I was surprised
to get your call, Frank.

40:32.266 --> 40:34.017
You change your mind?

40:34.018 --> 40:36.553
Congratulations on your
Webster Avenue case.

40:36.554 --> 40:38.572
Thank you.
Did you see we indicted

40:38.573 --> 40:40.657
the entire upper echelon
of the gang?

40:40.658 --> 40:41.958
Yes, I did.

40:41.959 --> 40:43.727
Erin was a big part of that.

40:43.728 --> 40:45.228
Big talent, your girl.

40:45.229 --> 40:48.031
Just offer her a bit of guidance
every now and then,

40:48.032 --> 40:49.432
and the results
are first-rate.

40:49.433 --> 40:50.934
For the most part.

40:50.935 --> 40:52.102
For the most part?

40:52.103 --> 40:53.236
Class-A felonies all around.

40:53.237 --> 40:55.071
Feels like a home run to me.

40:55.072 --> 40:57.541
Except for
the learning center closing.

40:57.542 --> 41:00.243
That is a shame.

41:00.244 --> 41:02.479
But... today's economy...

41:05.550 --> 41:07.801
If I were running
for mayor, Charley,

41:07.802 --> 41:11.288
putting that right, and letting
the world know about it...

41:11.289 --> 41:13.323
that would be a home run.

41:16.394 --> 41:19.646
The Webster Avenue Community
Learning Center!

41:21.449 --> 41:23.984
Let's hear it! Come on!

41:25.486 --> 41:26.970
Esteban!

41:26.971 --> 41:28.121
Huh?

41:29.957 --> 41:32.209
Funds were provided
by the generosity

41:32.210 --> 41:34.311
of philanthropist James Herrera,

41:34.312 --> 41:37.747
and made possible by District
Attorney Charles Rossellini.

41:37.748 --> 41:39.850
Did you have anything
to do with this?

41:39.851 --> 41:41.084
I did not.

41:41.085 --> 41:42.452
Where's <i>my</i> beer?

41:42.453 --> 41:44.120
You had your one
before dinner.

41:44.121 --> 41:47.791
I'm cut off, the game
hasn't even started yet.

41:47.792 --> 41:50.794
I'm overwhelmed with joy
to see this happening.

41:50.795 --> 41:54.030
Do you see the men who tried to
kill you here in this courtroom?

41:54.031 --> 41:55.098
Yes, I do.

41:55.099 --> 41:57.434
Will you point them
out to us, please?

41:58.302 --> 42:00.737
Chavo, at the end...

42:01.606 --> 42:04.107
...Julio and T-Bone.

42:06.744 --> 42:09.112
Let the record reflect
that Mr. Torres

42:09.113 --> 42:11.281
has pointed to
the three defendants.

42:11.282 --> 42:12.582
Where were you

42:12.583 --> 42:13.750
when these events occurred?

42:13.751 --> 42:15.585
At the Webster Avenue
Learning Center.

42:15.586 --> 42:16.920
You are the founder

42:16.921 --> 42:19.256
of the Webster Avenue Learning
Center, is that correct?

42:19.257 --> 42:20.373
That is correct.

42:20.374 --> 42:21.841
Did there come a time

42:21.842 --> 42:24.127
when the center was
in such dire financial shape

42:24.128 --> 42:25.795
that you turned
to someone for help?

42:25.796 --> 42:28.014
Yes, that is true.
Who was that person?

42:28.015 --> 42:30.667
It was Pablo Torres,

42:30.668 --> 42:31.668
my brother.

42:31.669 --> 42:33.837
Isn't it true that Pablo

42:33.838 --> 42:36.273
was also a high-ranking member
of the Webster Avenue Boys?

42:36.274 --> 42:38.375
Yes.

42:38.376 --> 42:43.146
Pablo did some bad things,
things that I cannot defend...

42:43.147 --> 42:44.915
but he was brother,

42:44.916 --> 42:47.350
and between us, that came first.

42:47.351 --> 42:49.686
Anyone who has a brother,

42:49.687 --> 42:52.188
I don't have to explain.
