01:07.720 --> 01:09.390
It's very Christian of you

01:09.440 --> 01:12.430
to bear the responsibility
of the wake, Miss Mardle.

01:12.480 --> 01:15.390
Well, it's been a very difficult
time for Mr. Grove.

01:15.440 --> 01:17.150
It's the least I can do.

01:17.200 --> 01:19.800
Even so, you're a loyal friend.

01:42.560 --> 01:44.560
Thank you.

01:47.200 --> 01:48.870
Of all the people...

01:48.920 --> 01:50.590
She was too young.

01:50.640 --> 01:53.710
It only seems like yesterday we
were all starting out together.

01:58.280 --> 02:00.750
Mr. Selfridge, we weren't
expecting you.

02:00.800 --> 02:02.590
I came to pay my respects.

02:02.640 --> 02:04.430
Is it a suitable time?

02:04.480 --> 02:06.630
Yes, of course. Mr. Grove
is in the dining room.

02:06.680 --> 02:08.680
Please come in.

02:15.480 --> 02:17.470
Can I come in?

02:17.520 --> 02:20.710
No, you can't. It's not
appropriate. Please go.

02:20.760 --> 02:24.360
She's only just been buried.
Give it time, Billy.

02:25.320 --> 02:28.320
I don't even know
where Doris is laid.

02:29.720 --> 02:31.790
The western side of Kensal Green...

02:31.840 --> 02:33.840
for the morning sun.

02:36.480 --> 02:39.220
The number 26 bus takes you there.

02:48.440 --> 02:50.440
What a world.

02:56.120 --> 02:58.110
Chief,

02:58.160 --> 02:59.910
you didn't have to come.

02:59.960 --> 03:02.300
Well, Doris was one of us.

03:02.560 --> 03:04.550
Thank you for the flowers.

03:04.600 --> 03:07.600
Would you like some
tea, Mr. Selfridge?

03:07.680 --> 03:09.670
Thank you, Miss Mardle, yes.

03:09.720 --> 03:12.240
Who was that young man?

03:14.240 --> 03:16.230
Young man?

03:16.280 --> 03:17.990
Er... Oh...

03:18.040 --> 03:19.710
It was a delivery boy.

03:19.760 --> 03:22.560
I'll get you the tea, Mr. Selfridge.

03:31.400 --> 03:33.540
How are you holding up?

03:34.400 --> 03:36.720
It's all right, Roger.

03:38.240 --> 03:40.590
What was she doing...

03:40.640 --> 03:42.780
running across a road?

03:43.800 --> 03:45.910
It's difficult to believe
it was God's will.

03:45.960 --> 03:48.830
They're crying for her...

03:48.880 --> 03:50.880
The children.

03:51.360 --> 03:53.150
How were they when you told them?

03:53.200 --> 03:55.070
They don't know.

03:55.120 --> 03:58.040
I said she was away visiting family.

03:59.360 --> 04:01.350
I've been in your shoes.

04:01.400 --> 04:03.790
My children got me through.

04:03.840 --> 04:06.440
They're stronger than you think.

04:14.440 --> 04:16.790
Small piece about you
in a column today.

04:16.839 --> 04:20.470
"The music, cocktails and charm
of the enigmatic Mr. Colleano

04:20.519 --> 04:23.190
make for an intoxicating evening."

04:23.240 --> 04:25.830
Just here to give us the reviews?

04:25.880 --> 04:27.990
I have some friends
who I'd like welcomed.

04:28.040 --> 04:29.870
They'll be in and
out as they see fit.

04:29.920 --> 04:32.590
- And who are they?
- Just friends, George.

04:32.640 --> 04:35.310
Just leave their names with Elsa.

04:35.920 --> 04:37.910
Things going well... backstage?

04:37.960 --> 04:39.960
I'll get the rake.

04:45.960 --> 04:47.950
How are you working it?

04:48.000 --> 04:50.830
Well, those in the know
ask for the clubroom.

04:50.880 --> 04:53.920
And we vet them and then
we take 'em through here.

05:04.400 --> 05:07.070
Had a little flutter
in here yet, George?

05:07.120 --> 05:09.350
Gambling's not my thing.

05:09.400 --> 05:11.950
You're missing out
on one of life's joys.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
If you say so.

05:19.640 --> 05:22.180
Think you're a bit above this?

05:22.320 --> 05:24.390
Of course he doesn't.

05:26.400 --> 05:28.540
I can speak for myself.

05:29.760 --> 05:32.030
I don't think I'm above this, no.

05:32.080 --> 05:34.790
My only concern is for my friend

05:34.840 --> 05:36.840
and our club.

05:37.600 --> 05:39.790
Both of which are in
the pink at the moment,

05:39.840 --> 05:41.840
wouldn't you say?

05:59.400 --> 06:01.390
I hear what's-her-name -

06:01.440 --> 06:04.230
the Selfridge girl - hasn't
been here much of late.

06:04.280 --> 06:07.230
She's got a name. Violette.

06:07.280 --> 06:09.230
All over between you two?

06:09.280 --> 06:11.670
Selfridge bring you to heel, did he?

06:11.720 --> 06:14.070
Shame.

06:14.120 --> 06:15.990
She's a draw.

06:16.040 --> 06:17.990
I'm afraid I'm not
like you, Mr. Regan.

06:18.040 --> 06:20.780
Looking for angles the whole time.

06:25.840 --> 06:27.910
Dogs is dogs, Victor.

06:43.600 --> 06:45.940
Thank you for minding them.

07:00.240 --> 07:02.240
Children...

07:05.040 --> 07:07.510
I have something to tell you.

07:17.640 --> 07:19.310
Ah, Mr. Crabb.

07:19.360 --> 07:21.310
I have an appointment, Miss Plunkett.

07:21.360 --> 07:23.360
He isn't there.

07:24.680 --> 07:26.670
It's almost five o'clock.

07:26.720 --> 07:29.630
We have the report to finalize
for the shareholders' meeting.

07:29.680 --> 07:33.400
- Do you know when he'll return?
- Your guess is as good as mine.

07:36.560 --> 07:40.060
After the wake, my first
thought was to see you.

07:40.120 --> 07:42.470
Oh, sounds like such a difficult day.

07:42.520 --> 07:44.520
Hm...

07:46.680 --> 07:50.180
Brings a lot of feelings
back up to the surface.

07:51.320 --> 07:53.310
Life is fragile.

07:53.360 --> 07:56.660
I mean, we think we know
how it'll turn out.

07:57.400 --> 07:59.540
Nothing is guaranteed.

08:01.200 --> 08:03.190
No.

08:03.240 --> 08:05.630
That's why we have to
work hard here and now

08:05.680 --> 08:08.020
to achieve what we desire.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.990
And I know you.

08:12.040 --> 08:14.350
As soon as this project's
up and running,

08:14.400 --> 08:17.900
you'll be on to the next
grand Selfridge scheme.

08:18.880 --> 08:22.780
It sounds like you want it
all to be over, Miss Webb.

08:23.400 --> 08:25.520
No. Not at all.

08:27.560 --> 08:29.550
- Let's go out.
- Where?

08:29.600 --> 08:31.940
Wherever the wind takes us.

09:05.140 --> 09:07.570
Tabac Blond by Caron.

09:07.620 --> 09:09.620
Straight from Paris.

09:11.220 --> 09:13.250
What do you think?

09:13.300 --> 09:15.300
It's beautiful.

09:20.460 --> 09:23.010
No, Harry, I couldn't
possibly take it.

09:23.060 --> 09:25.860
<i>Oh, no, it's OK. I know the owner.</i>

09:26.740 --> 09:29.490
We shouldn't be here. It feels wrong.

09:29.540 --> 09:33.240
We must all do things that
feel illicit sometimes.

09:34.380 --> 09:36.490
Fashion next I think.

09:36.540 --> 09:38.540
Come on.

09:52.380 --> 09:54.650
How are things at the store?

09:54.700 --> 09:58.410
I'm sure Gordon could do with me
around, getting him out of scrapes.

09:58.460 --> 10:02.250
Mr. Selfridge has made it very clear
there's no rush for you to return.

10:06.780 --> 10:09.120
Do you want to go to them?

10:11.260 --> 10:13.730
I told them when I came home.

10:15.500 --> 10:17.410
That must have been
terribly difficult.

10:17.460 --> 10:20.090
One cannot hide news
of that magnitude.

10:20.140 --> 10:22.140
No.

10:27.740 --> 10:30.010
I have something for you.

10:36.740 --> 10:38.810
It was Doris's.

10:38.860 --> 10:40.610
She always spoke so highly of you.

10:40.660 --> 10:43.810
I know she would have
liked you to have it.

10:43.860 --> 10:46.730
- I can't accept it.
- It's a thank you.

10:47.580 --> 10:49.920
You don't have to thank me.

10:54.580 --> 10:56.570
I don't have many friends.

10:56.620 --> 10:59.620
Always so busy with
work and the family.

11:00.500 --> 11:02.890
Something like this
makes you realize.

11:02.940 --> 11:06.340
Your support has been
beyond the call of duty.

11:07.940 --> 11:09.940
Please.

11:14.580 --> 11:16.570
I shall keep it as
a memento of Doris.

11:16.620 --> 11:18.620
Good.

11:19.780 --> 11:21.780
Good night, Roger.

11:26.060 --> 11:28.170
Hello, Bill. How are
you? You all right?

11:28.220 --> 11:30.570
- Gentlemen, would you like a table?
- No, thanks.

11:30.620 --> 11:33.810
- Evening, gents.
- These are friends of Mr. Regan.

11:33.860 --> 11:35.530
Are you looking for the clubroom?

11:35.580 --> 11:38.020
No, Mr. Colleano.

11:44.300 --> 11:46.440
Ah, you look beautiful.

11:52.300 --> 11:54.290
Straight up or with a kick?

11:54.340 --> 11:56.330
Oh, no, straight.

11:56.380 --> 11:58.650
I'm giddy enough already!

12:00.940 --> 12:02.610
Ooh!

12:05.940 --> 12:08.940
I love spending time
with you like this.

12:22.180 --> 12:24.170
So, tell me, Mr. Selfridge,

12:24.220 --> 12:27.490
do you often run riot with
ladies in your store?

12:27.540 --> 12:29.850
You know, this is the first time.

12:29.900 --> 12:32.640
Mm... I find that hard to believe.

12:33.420 --> 12:36.090
If I owned this place,
I'd be here all the time.

12:36.140 --> 12:38.130
Mm...

12:38.180 --> 12:41.650
I'm going to tell you something
not very many people know.

12:43.740 --> 12:46.290
I'm not the owner of
Selfridge's any more.

12:46.340 --> 12:49.290
- Not outright anyhow.
- What?

12:49.340 --> 12:52.410
I had a little trouble raising
the finance for our estate,

12:52.460 --> 12:54.610
so I had to sell off
some of my shares.

12:54.660 --> 12:57.250
- How many?
- 5%.

12:57.300 --> 13:00.170
Takes my personal holding below
50%. So it's not a problem.

13:00.220 --> 13:01.970
You shouldn't have done that.

13:02.020 --> 13:03.690
Why not?

13:03.740 --> 13:06.610
Well, the store is everything to you.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.530
The store will still
be here in 100 years.

13:09.580 --> 13:12.380
I care about what's important today.

13:20.300 --> 13:23.810
The budget can cover sideboards
if we opt for the cheaper tables.

13:23.860 --> 13:25.850
I'll see how the numbers work out.

13:25.900 --> 13:27.900
Now, living rooms...

13:31.300 --> 13:33.900
Late night catching up with you?

13:34.100 --> 13:35.730
Yes...

13:35.780 --> 13:37.780
a little.

13:40.140 --> 13:42.130
Why don't you leave me to finish up?

13:42.180 --> 13:44.690
Oh... Well, are you sure?

13:44.740 --> 13:48.330
Your father's asked me to attend the
shareholders' meeting this morning.

13:48.380 --> 13:50.210
He does like an audience.

13:50.260 --> 13:52.850
So things are still difficult
between the two of you?

13:52.900 --> 13:55.850
- I'm finding a way through it.
- Good.

13:55.900 --> 13:58.700
- Go on. I'll be fine.
- Oh, thank you.

14:06.900 --> 14:09.810
Keeping up to date with the
Paris Peace Conference?

14:09.860 --> 14:11.860
Horses, actually.

14:18.140 --> 14:20.540
I thought she'd never leave.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.330
Nancy and I have a lot to do.

14:25.100 --> 14:27.090
Want some help?

14:27.140 --> 14:30.140
What do you know about
furnishing soldiers' houses?

14:31.180 --> 14:33.170
Plenty.

14:33.220 --> 14:36.020
First, I want to show you something.

14:39.180 --> 14:40.970
What do you reckon?

14:41.020 --> 14:43.650
Yeah, I know it's not a Rolls
Royce or a Bugatti, but...

14:43.700 --> 14:45.690
Handsome.

14:45.740 --> 14:47.880
How can you afford it?

14:49.220 --> 14:51.210
The club's doing all right.

14:51.260 --> 14:52.970
Why don't you take me there tonight?

14:53.020 --> 14:55.690
I can tell Pa I'm going to
the theater with a friend.

14:55.740 --> 14:58.420
Yeah. Maybe.

15:01.180 --> 15:04.480
How about we get the
wind in our hair first?

15:07.620 --> 15:11.690
I would have preferred it if you'd looked
this over yesterday, Mr. Selfridge.

15:11.740 --> 15:13.730
The accounts aren't
the most dazzling,

15:13.780 --> 15:16.290
but I've tried to outline
the mitigating factors.

15:16.340 --> 15:19.340
It's first-class, Mr.
Crabb. Shall we go?

15:22.460 --> 15:24.610
- Have you read the addendum?
- Of course.

15:24.660 --> 15:27.330
I adore your addendums, Mr. Crabb.

15:28.460 --> 15:30.570
- Guess who's back...
- What a surprise.

15:30.620 --> 15:32.690
I thought you weren't
back till the weekend.

15:32.740 --> 15:36.250
We caught an earlier boat train.
Serge has business to attend to.

15:36.300 --> 15:39.370
- Are you free for tea?
- I would love nothing more,

15:39.420 --> 15:41.730
but we are on our way to
a shareholders' meeting.

15:41.780 --> 15:43.490
Business, business...

15:43.540 --> 15:47.440
As shareholders, you're more
than welcome to join us.

15:48.380 --> 15:50.890
Or you could take tea
at the emporium...

15:50.940 --> 15:53.690
- with my compliments.
- Oh, how generous.

15:53.740 --> 15:56.210
What a very kind man you are.

15:59.140 --> 16:01.610
Please don't let me keep you.

16:02.540 --> 16:04.810
Until this evening, then.

16:06.380 --> 16:09.770
- Oh, how lovely.
- And I want to order some new headed paper.

16:09.820 --> 16:12.290
De Bolotoff and De
Sibour Enterprises.

16:12.340 --> 16:14.050
Who is this De Sibour?

16:14.100 --> 16:16.890
- A new business partner, Mother. I told you.
- Oh...

16:16.940 --> 16:20.690
He's an aviator and
we have grand plans.

16:20.740 --> 16:22.050
Shall we?

16:22.100 --> 16:24.610
You could charge the stationery
to Rosalie's account.

16:24.660 --> 16:27.290
Thank you, Madame Selfridge,
but I have capital of my own.

16:27.340 --> 16:30.370
I have some premises to look at
later. Would you like to come?

16:30.420 --> 16:33.520
I'm meeting friends.
I'll see you at home.

16:34.060 --> 16:35.850
- Bye. Bye, Grandma.
- Goodbye.

16:35.900 --> 16:37.570
Let me hail you a cab.

16:37.620 --> 16:39.290
Why, thank you!

16:39.340 --> 16:41.050
Something happened in Paris.

16:41.100 --> 16:43.100
Doesn't it always?

16:50.180 --> 16:52.570
I thought these could go faster.

16:52.620 --> 16:55.930
Are you saying I can't keep up with
you? Is that what you're saying?

16:55.980 --> 16:57.970
All right, hold on!

17:07.980 --> 17:09.650
Sales are a little flat,

17:09.700 --> 17:12.010
but Selfridge's remains
No 0.1 on Oxford Street.

17:12.060 --> 17:14.010
Why?

17:14.060 --> 17:17.730
Because we continue to understand
what the customers want.

17:17.780 --> 17:20.650
They want hope, they want life,

17:20.700 --> 17:22.369
sensuality...

17:22.420 --> 17:24.930
Death has stalked the fields
of Europe for too long.

17:24.980 --> 17:28.900
Now is the time for all of
us to look to the future.

17:33.780 --> 17:36.690
Motion to approve the report
and accounts, say aye.

17:36.740 --> 17:38.290
- Aye!
- Thank you.

17:38.340 --> 17:40.010
Any questions? No...

17:40.060 --> 17:42.060
I have one.

17:43.140 --> 17:47.940
How much longer are you going to take advantage
of your shareholders, Mr. Selfridge?

17:49.220 --> 17:52.090
- What are you doing here?
- Answer the question.

17:52.140 --> 17:54.890
Lord Loxley, this is a
most improper invasion.

17:54.940 --> 17:57.490
You need to be a shareholder
to attend this meeting.

17:57.540 --> 17:59.530
Oh. Well...

17:59.580 --> 18:01.580
5% do?

18:02.260 --> 18:05.380
Picked them up for a
song not two weeks ago.

18:10.900 --> 18:13.130
Let's call the meeting
to an end and reconvene.

18:13.180 --> 18:14.970
I'm not running from him.

18:15.020 --> 18:17.850
Lord Loxley, if you
have something to say,

18:17.900 --> 18:19.900
let's hear it.

18:21.140 --> 18:23.410
I've learned of certain facts

18:23.460 --> 18:26.850
that show Mr. Selfridge
runs this company

18:26.900 --> 18:29.490
as if it were his personal piggy bank.

18:29.540 --> 18:32.410
- What facts?
- Erm...

18:32.460 --> 18:35.730
A residence at Arlington Street,

18:35.780 --> 18:37.490
four vehicles,

18:37.540 --> 18:40.850
allowances for each of his children.

18:40.900 --> 18:44.130
Is it not true that all
of these "expenses"

18:44.180 --> 18:46.770
go through the chairman's account?

18:46.820 --> 18:48.930
Is that true, Mr. Selfridge?

18:48.980 --> 18:52.130
Mr. Selfridge's children are
ambassadors for the store.

18:52.180 --> 18:53.650
Ambassadors?

18:53.700 --> 18:56.810
He has committed no crime.

18:56.860 --> 18:58.610
Technically, perhaps not.

18:58.660 --> 19:00.370
But what does it say about the man?

19:00.420 --> 19:02.620
It says he doesn't care.

19:03.660 --> 19:07.330
It says he has lost interest
in this company.

19:07.380 --> 19:09.930
- That is not true.
- Ah!

19:09.980 --> 19:11.930
Such loyalty...

19:11.980 --> 19:13.930
from the young heir to the throne.

19:13.980 --> 19:18.090
Your leader has thrown
away his majority share.

19:18.140 --> 19:22.010
He has sold his own shares whilst
they're at rock-bottom prices.

19:22.060 --> 19:25.050
What man in this room would put
himself in such a position?

19:25.100 --> 19:29.730
I sold those shares to raise
money for the Selfridge Estate.

19:29.780 --> 19:32.690
Your vanity projects are
of no benefit to this store.

19:32.740 --> 19:34.740
How dare you!

19:35.980 --> 19:38.580
Oh. You must be Miss Webb.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.130
I can see now why

19:42.180 --> 19:44.850
Mr. Selfridge has spent all
his time on his pet project.

19:44.900 --> 19:46.900
That's enough!

19:50.620 --> 19:53.970
Lord Loxley is correct. The share
price has dipped of late,

19:54.020 --> 19:57.220
which is why today I
make you this promise.

19:57.940 --> 19:59.810
Over the next three months,

19:59.860 --> 20:03.570
your share value will increase
no less than 10%.

20:03.620 --> 20:05.610
You have my word.

20:09.900 --> 20:12.570
Placing it all on red, Selfridge?

20:13.540 --> 20:16.840
Thank you all for attending
today. Thank you.

20:23.220 --> 20:26.410
10%? How on earth are we going
to fulfill such a promise?

20:26.460 --> 20:29.460
We'll find a way, Mr.
Crabb. We always do.

20:31.820 --> 20:33.650
I like that. That's very good.

20:33.700 --> 20:36.090
And that fan is very beautiful.

20:36.140 --> 20:38.280
The fan is delightful.

20:39.180 --> 20:41.320
I need to talk to you.

20:43.300 --> 20:46.610
I feel wholly responsible. Look,
is there anything I can do?

20:46.660 --> 20:49.000
No. I've got this covered.

21:01.460 --> 21:04.050
They'll say this was the
beginning of the end.

21:04.100 --> 21:07.100
- They will not. Of that I assure you.
- We'll see.

21:08.380 --> 21:10.170
Where did you get that information?

21:10.220 --> 21:13.210
Mr. De Bolotoff was very forthcoming,

21:13.260 --> 21:15.700
when we were friends.

21:16.660 --> 21:20.330
By the way, I'll be expecting
a seat on the board.

21:20.380 --> 21:23.890
You'll need more than my 5%
to get anywhere near my board.

21:23.940 --> 21:25.610
Oh, did I say I had 5%?

21:25.660 --> 21:27.290
I should have said 7%.

21:27.340 --> 21:30.770
Your son-in-law placed some of his
wife's shares on the market last week,

21:30.820 --> 21:33.820
which I believe entitles
me to a seat.

21:34.580 --> 21:36.570
See you at the next board meeting,

21:36.620 --> 21:38.620
Harry old chum.

21:43.300 --> 21:46.250
You have to accept that the
arrangement is no longer possible.

21:46.300 --> 21:48.530
- But the boy is my own.
- I know.

21:48.580 --> 21:51.010
But Mrs. Groves' husband
is unaware of that.

21:51.060 --> 21:53.660
- Then he'll have to be told.
- No!

21:54.340 --> 21:56.330
You can't do that.

21:56.380 --> 21:58.850
You started this, Miss Mardle.

21:58.900 --> 22:01.300
It's up to you to finish it.

22:05.180 --> 22:07.920
It's great to get out of the club.

22:08.780 --> 22:11.090
I've been looking forward
to seeing you.

22:11.140 --> 22:13.090
Thought I might have
seen you at the wake.

22:13.140 --> 22:15.130
I don't like them.

22:15.180 --> 22:17.170
I remember sitting at Ma's,

22:17.220 --> 22:19.210
rain pouring down.

22:19.260 --> 22:21.050
It was as though I
was inside a bottle.

22:21.100 --> 22:24.100
I wanted to scream
or smash something.

22:24.980 --> 22:27.120
That's why I like you.

22:32.100 --> 22:33.850
Oh, right...

22:33.900 --> 22:37.050
Brought a little light reading,
did you? In case you get bored...

22:37.100 --> 22:40.970
Hey! Give it back. You said you were
going to help me, not tease me.

22:41.020 --> 22:43.010
I'm sorry.

22:43.060 --> 22:46.050
It's not easy figuring out
how to furnish those houses.

22:46.100 --> 22:48.240
I want to get it right.

22:49.740 --> 22:51.730
All you need is a good table,

22:51.780 --> 22:53.780
sturdy chairs...

22:54.980 --> 22:57.250
...and a comfortable bed.

22:59.740 --> 23:01.450
Isn't that a bit Spartan?

23:01.500 --> 23:05.210
It's what the family men
dreamt of in the trenches.

23:05.260 --> 23:07.660
A table with kids around it.

23:08.660 --> 23:11.260
A bed to curl up with the wife.

23:15.580 --> 23:19.380
Do you reckon you could live
in one of those houses?

23:20.980 --> 23:23.320
It depends who it was with.

23:33.020 --> 23:35.010
Gosh.

23:35.060 --> 23:37.260
You open in three hours.

23:38.020 --> 23:39.770
Mind if I drive?

23:39.820 --> 23:42.220
Dancing and drinking awaits!

23:47.740 --> 23:49.730
A good day, sir?

23:49.780 --> 23:52.690
When Serge arrives home,
tell him to come and see me.

23:52.740 --> 23:55.140
I'll be in the drawing room.

23:56.900 --> 23:58.900
Night, Miss Mardle.

24:00.940 --> 24:02.810
She's been funny all day.

24:02.860 --> 24:04.730
Who's in the mood for a steak?

24:04.780 --> 24:06.730
A new place just opened
on Barrett Street.

24:06.780 --> 24:09.250
Steaks direct from Argentina.

24:10.260 --> 24:12.610
Would you like to join us
for supper, Miss Mardle?

24:12.660 --> 24:14.660
No. Thank you.

24:15.860 --> 24:17.730
- Can we get jelly?
- Jelly?

24:17.780 --> 24:20.330
Yeah, I love it, especially
with the fruit in it.

24:20.380 --> 24:23.180
You're a connoisseur, Miss Hawkins.

24:29.620 --> 24:32.090
Tell me to mind my own
business, Miss Mardle,

24:32.140 --> 24:35.490
but you appear to be carrying the weight
of the world on your shoulders.

24:35.540 --> 24:38.900
Whatever's the matter?

24:44.100 --> 24:46.640
Doris told me a few weeks ago.

24:46.820 --> 24:49.900
I interfered. I tried to do right.

24:51.180 --> 24:53.980
I should have just left well alone.

24:57.300 --> 24:59.300
Billy won't go away.

25:00.580 --> 25:03.450
If I don't do something soon,
he's going to tell Mr. Grove,

25:03.500 --> 25:06.700
and I daren't think how
that will turn out.

25:07.900 --> 25:09.900
- He has to know.
- No!

25:12.220 --> 25:14.210
No. I can't tell him.

25:14.260 --> 25:16.400
- Why?
- Because I just...

25:17.180 --> 25:18.930
I can't.

25:18.980 --> 25:23.080
Is it because you don't want
him thinking badly of you?

25:29.540 --> 25:32.340
You've been carrying a heavy burden.

25:33.860 --> 25:35.860
But he has to know.

25:43.020 --> 25:45.820
Would you like me to accompany you?

25:46.940 --> 25:48.940
No.

25:49.380 --> 25:51.520
But thank you, Arthur.

25:56.860 --> 25:58.450
Evening, Fraser.

25:58.500 --> 26:00.090
Have I missed supper?

26:00.140 --> 26:02.330
Mr. Selfridge would like
to speak with you, sir?

26:02.380 --> 26:04.650
He's in the drawing room.

26:14.020 --> 26:16.970
I have to congratulate you on the
staff you have in stationery.

26:17.020 --> 26:19.690
They've been wonderfully helpful.

26:22.700 --> 26:27.900
Have you been talking to Lord Loxley
about our personal financial affairs?

26:28.420 --> 26:30.650
What? No.

26:30.700 --> 26:32.700
Think, Serge!

26:35.100 --> 26:37.650
We spoke when we were discussing
the aerodrome maybe.

26:37.700 --> 26:40.290
But I didn't tell him anything
he shouldn't have known.

26:40.340 --> 26:42.450
What about Rosalie's
Selfridge shares?

26:42.500 --> 26:44.490
Have you been selling them?

26:44.540 --> 26:47.690
As Rosalie's husband, I'm entitled
to buy or sell on her behalf.

26:47.740 --> 26:49.530
Lord Loxley bought them.

26:49.580 --> 26:51.970
He owns 7% of Selfridge's.

26:52.020 --> 26:54.210
He will have a seat on our board.

26:54.260 --> 26:56.370
I didn't know.

26:56.420 --> 27:00.020
I needed to raise capital
for a business venture.

27:03.300 --> 27:05.210
So you sold us out.

27:05.260 --> 27:08.370
- No, it's not as it seems.
- Get out of my sight.

27:08.420 --> 27:10.420
Get out!

27:25.940 --> 27:27.930
We went for a picnic.

27:27.980 --> 27:29.690
Very fancy. Where did you go?

27:29.740 --> 27:32.250
The seaside.

27:32.300 --> 27:34.610
Yeah? The seaside?!

27:34.660 --> 27:37.170
I'm surprised that thing
made it round the block.

27:37.220 --> 27:39.210
It drives rather well, actually.

27:39.260 --> 27:41.130
You let her behind the wheel, Victor?

27:41.180 --> 27:44.050
- It was a little smoky.
- Nothing a Martini won't fix.

27:44.100 --> 27:46.100
I'll line 'em up.

27:56.060 --> 27:58.970
Cheer up. What's the matter with you?

27:59.020 --> 28:00.730
Nothing.

28:00.780 --> 28:02.770
Are you going to be in
trouble, being here?

28:02.820 --> 28:04.890
I'll be fine. I'll be home by nine...

28:04.940 --> 28:06.940
if you let me.

28:13.620 --> 28:15.620
Excuse me.

28:42.900 --> 28:46.020
I don't know who it was, whether
it was Pinkerton or not.

28:48.220 --> 28:50.220
What has happened?

28:52.460 --> 28:54.600
I sold shares in Paris.

28:55.780 --> 28:57.980
Lord Loxley bought them.

28:59.500 --> 29:01.650
He'll have a place on the board.

29:01.700 --> 29:03.690
We're not welcome here any longer.

29:03.740 --> 29:05.530
I've ruined everything.

29:05.580 --> 29:07.580
Where's Harry?

29:10.300 --> 29:13.420
You're exaggerating.
You always exaggerate.

29:14.300 --> 29:16.300
Look at me, Serge.

29:22.100 --> 29:24.100
Right, out!

29:25.100 --> 29:27.570
We won't have it in our club.

29:33.500 --> 29:35.930
What do you think you're
doing? Sling your hook.

29:35.980 --> 29:37.980
Turn around.

29:41.620 --> 29:44.220
It's all right, George. I know.

29:55.860 --> 29:58.130
A roulette table we said.

29:59.620 --> 30:01.690
That was as far as
we were going to go.

30:01.740 --> 30:03.410
I hoped it wouldn't happen,

30:03.460 --> 30:06.330
but I knew it was a possibility
when we shook hands with Regan.

30:06.380 --> 30:09.290
What did they call it in the
trenches? "Forced march."

30:09.340 --> 30:11.010
Soldiers using to go loopy on it.

30:11.060 --> 30:13.570
Why would anyone want to
do that stuff for fun?

30:13.620 --> 30:15.450
Because, George,

30:15.500 --> 30:17.290
the world has rolled round.

30:17.340 --> 30:20.890
People want to try things they
didn't do before the war.

30:20.940 --> 30:23.530
Why? Because they know

30:23.580 --> 30:25.610
life is short.

30:25.660 --> 30:27.650
And we've seen it.

30:27.700 --> 30:30.970
Boys, kids, lives not
yet lived, gone...

30:31.020 --> 30:33.020
...like that.

30:34.340 --> 30:37.050
Who are you trying to
convince? Me or yourself?

30:37.100 --> 30:40.690
You don't understand. You've got
this different mind-set, George.

30:40.740 --> 30:43.170
- Don't show yourself up.
- Why are you like this?

30:43.220 --> 30:47.010
- Like what?
- Like YOU! Just straight the whole time.

30:47.060 --> 30:48.930
- You are so straight.
- I know what goes on.

30:48.980 --> 30:51.320
Victor, I am not an idiot!

30:55.460 --> 30:58.570
If we let this continue, we're going
to have trouble on our hands.

30:58.620 --> 31:00.620
Oh...

31:01.380 --> 31:03.170
I don't know if you've forgotten,

31:03.220 --> 31:05.970
but I walked out on a job for
life at Selfridge's for this.

31:06.020 --> 31:08.690
- I never asked you to.
- You needed me.

31:08.740 --> 31:10.740
I needed you?!

31:12.620 --> 31:14.560
Listen to yourself.

31:15.820 --> 31:18.770
Just get on the telephone to Regan
and let him know what's what.

31:18.820 --> 31:20.490
What do you think he's going to say?

31:20.540 --> 31:22.970
"Sorry about that, mate.
Won't happen again."

31:23.020 --> 31:24.610
What's his number?

31:24.660 --> 31:27.060
No, leave it, I'll do it.

31:28.340 --> 31:30.540
Go on. I'll talk to him.

31:32.300 --> 31:34.300
Go on.

31:39.140 --> 31:42.050
You just want me out of
the office, don't you?

31:42.100 --> 31:44.440
We're earning at long last.

31:46.220 --> 31:49.020
Think of all the things we could do.

32:12.740 --> 32:14.740
Serge, please.

32:15.420 --> 32:17.140
Serge, stop!

32:19.740 --> 32:22.210
I'll talk to Pa.

32:22.260 --> 32:24.860
Your grandmother already tried.

32:26.260 --> 32:28.770
You don't deserve me, Rosalie.

32:28.820 --> 32:30.610
I'm selfish...

32:30.660 --> 32:32.410
I'm vain...

32:32.460 --> 32:34.460
I'm pregnant, Serge.

32:37.500 --> 32:42.700
I will not let this family
fall apart without a fight.

32:49.980 --> 32:52.170
He's family now and he betrayed us.

32:52.220 --> 32:55.210
It wasn't a betrayal. It was foolish,

32:55.260 --> 32:57.850
but I don't believe it
was maliciously intended.

32:57.900 --> 33:01.210
Loxley has borne a grudge against
me since his wife divorced him.

33:01.260 --> 33:03.650
He blames me. Now he
sits on the board.

33:03.700 --> 33:06.170
But that isn't Serge's fault.

33:06.620 --> 33:09.650
He's using what we have
to establish a business,

33:09.700 --> 33:12.450
just as you have done to establish
the Selfridge Estate.

33:12.500 --> 33:14.930
I appreciate that you're
trying to defend Serge,

33:14.980 --> 33:17.010
but nothing you say will fix this.

33:17.060 --> 33:19.060
He will have to go.

33:20.700 --> 33:22.700
If Serge leaves...

33:23.660 --> 33:25.890
...so will I.

33:25.940 --> 33:28.480
So will your first grandchild.

33:30.540 --> 33:32.540
Oh...

33:36.620 --> 33:38.290
What's the matter now?

33:38.340 --> 33:41.740
Why is everyone standing
around like servants?

33:50.860 --> 33:52.850
Congratulations, Serge.

33:52.900 --> 33:56.970
Thank you. I'm sorry for putting
you in a difficult position.

33:57.020 --> 34:00.140
I will do everything I possibly
can to make things right.

34:04.660 --> 34:07.130
<i>You're damn right you will.</i>

34:08.860 --> 34:11.170
Fraser, champagne.

34:11.219 --> 34:14.690
What for? Why am I the last to know?

34:14.739 --> 34:18.250
The next generation of Selfridge's
are on their way, Princess Marie.

34:18.300 --> 34:20.889
Oh, my darling, darling girl!

34:20.940 --> 34:23.889
- Oh, sweetheart.
- Oh...

34:23.940 --> 34:26.739
Vodka too, Fraser. How wonderful!

34:33.980 --> 34:35.650
I'd...

34:35.699 --> 34:38.570
given up on your visiting altogether.

34:38.780 --> 34:41.780
I wasn't going to, but then
I rather thought I should.

34:43.659 --> 34:45.659
Please go through.

34:54.020 --> 34:57.020
I can see that you're
preoccupied, Josie.

34:57.580 --> 35:00.380
Is there something you wish to say?

35:02.020 --> 35:05.020
There is no easy way
to tell you this.

35:05.860 --> 35:08.600
But while you were away serving...

35:10.940 --> 35:13.340
...Doris had a brief affair.

35:15.260 --> 35:17.250
What on earth are you talking about?

35:17.300 --> 35:19.300
It's Ernest.

35:21.260 --> 35:23.930
He was the product of that union.

35:26.580 --> 35:28.650
I am so sorry, Roger.

35:32.500 --> 35:34.840
But Ernest is not your son.

35:42.454 --> 35:44.454
An old flame.

35:46.180 --> 35:48.180
His name's Billy.

35:49.180 --> 35:52.280
They knew each other
when they were young.

35:54.580 --> 35:57.250
And she told you this some weeks ago?

35:57.300 --> 36:00.140
She was frightened of your reaction.

36:02.140 --> 36:05.240
It wasn't my place to
tell her what to do.

36:05.620 --> 36:07.810
So, instead,

36:07.860 --> 36:11.180
you plot and scheme...

36:12.700 --> 36:14.700
You lie.

36:15.300 --> 36:18.370
You take the child to
meet its real father.

36:18.420 --> 36:21.620
We thought we were doing
right by everyone.

36:21.900 --> 36:25.570
Was he the young man I
saw outside your house?

36:25.620 --> 36:27.620
Yes.

36:33.700 --> 36:35.770
Ernest was with you

36:35.820 --> 36:38.160
on the day that Doris died.

36:40.260 --> 36:43.940
Were you en route to see
this man on that day?

36:47.540 --> 36:50.540
The accident happened
on our way home.

36:54.380 --> 36:56.380
So...

36:57.140 --> 36:59.730
If you had not involved yourself

36:59.780 --> 37:01.770
in matters that were
none of your concern,

37:01.820 --> 37:06.060
Doris and I would be asleep in
our beds at this very moment.

37:07.540 --> 37:09.770
I know how it must seem,

37:09.820 --> 37:12.050
but it was an accident.

37:12.100 --> 37:14.650
There are no accidents. People
do what they should not

37:14.700 --> 37:17.010
and then try to wheedle
out of the consequences.

37:17.060 --> 37:20.370
Now, yes, goodness knows, I wish
I hadn't tried to help her.

37:20.420 --> 37:22.130
But I told you

37:22.180 --> 37:23.890
she was frightened.

37:23.940 --> 37:26.210
Not as frightened as her
daughter was last night.

37:26.260 --> 37:28.210
I had to sit with her
and hold her hand

37:28.260 --> 37:30.260
until the dawn.

37:32.900 --> 37:34.900
Oh, God...

37:36.900 --> 37:38.900
I am so sorry.

37:43.340 --> 37:47.730
I thought your actions in these last
weeks were those of a true friend.

37:47.780 --> 37:50.370
I AM your friend.

37:50.420 --> 37:53.460
I see now... they were
driven by guilt.

38:04.940 --> 38:06.940
Go and get him.

38:09.140 --> 38:11.140
- Who?
- The child.

38:13.220 --> 38:15.220
No...

38:20.100 --> 38:22.770
You should go home now, Violette.

38:23.380 --> 38:25.370
I thought you wanted me here.

38:25.420 --> 38:27.410
What's changed?

38:27.460 --> 38:29.450
This place has.

38:29.500 --> 38:32.370
It still says Colleano's on the door.

38:32.580 --> 38:35.120
What is it? What's eating you?

38:35.660 --> 38:37.660
Victor!

38:39.460 --> 38:41.460
Stay there.

38:56.740 --> 38:58.810
Can you hear me, sir?

38:59.100 --> 39:01.240
Sir, can you hear me?!

39:03.900 --> 39:06.040
I told you to stay put.

39:11.820 --> 39:13.650
Right, I'll call the doctor.

39:13.700 --> 39:16.450
Wait. He bought this

39:16.500 --> 39:18.930
from Regan's men, the
ones you let stay.

39:18.980 --> 39:20.810
A doctor will report
this to the police,

39:20.860 --> 39:22.930
and you'll have real
trouble on your hands.

39:22.980 --> 39:25.320
I'll get Violette a brandy.

39:48.660 --> 39:50.660
Wake up!

39:51.180 --> 39:53.180
Wake... up!

39:54.100 --> 39:56.100
Wake up!

40:04.140 --> 40:06.140
Go home!

40:20.220 --> 40:22.250
Seeing Harry at the
shareholders' meeting

40:22.300 --> 40:25.410
making that promise
completely off the cuff

40:25.460 --> 40:27.800
it was just... remarkable.

40:29.620 --> 40:31.290
He's a gambler.

40:31.340 --> 40:33.330
It's in his bones.

40:33.380 --> 40:35.090
He will stake everything he has

40:35.140 --> 40:37.460
for something he wants.

40:38.980 --> 40:40.970
This is nice.

40:41.020 --> 40:43.730
Harry gave it to me last night.

40:43.780 --> 40:46.650
- We're not here for dresses and perfume.
- I know that.

40:46.700 --> 40:48.700
But it isn't easy.

40:50.020 --> 40:52.450
What we're doing to
him and his family...

40:52.500 --> 40:54.170
is huge.

40:54.220 --> 40:57.770
You need to step back, remember
what we're here for.

40:57.820 --> 40:59.820
America.

41:02.060 --> 41:04.060
A fresh start.

41:06.060 --> 41:09.740
You're getting too involved with
him. It could ruin everything.

41:22.220 --> 41:24.210
That man, was he OK?

41:24.260 --> 41:26.260
He's fine.

41:31.300 --> 41:34.300
Come on, Violette,
it's time you went.

41:36.060 --> 41:38.060
I want to stay.

41:39.300 --> 41:41.300
You can't.

41:46.260 --> 41:48.800
I'll walk you to the cab rank.

41:49.820 --> 41:52.090
What is it? What's wrong?

41:55.780 --> 41:57.780
Your father's right.

41:58.860 --> 42:00.730
My world...

42:00.780 --> 42:02.780
is no place for you.

42:04.300 --> 42:06.810
I've tried to find
a way to make it work.

42:06.860 --> 42:09.170
I have.

42:09.220 --> 42:12.340
But I can't. I just can't.

42:14.500 --> 42:16.500
But I love you.

42:24.260 --> 42:27.260
Love doesn't make a
difference, Violette.

42:37.820 --> 42:40.420
You're gutless, Victor Colleano!

42:51.860 --> 42:53.860
Shh!

43:00.260 --> 43:02.260
Shh!
