<b>part of the challenge.</b>

16:52.613 --> 16:53.747
<b>- Jason hit the challenge.</b>

16:53.847 --> 16:56.750
<b>Jason, you do have what it takes</b>
<b>to be Ink Master.</b>

16:56.783 --> 16:58.852
<b>[crowd cheering]</b>

16:58.952 --> 17:00.387
<b>- There is no way in hell</b>

17:00.487 --> 17:03.257
<b>that I'm coming in</b>
<b>second place again.</b>

17:03.357 --> 17:05.858
<b>I'm here to take back</b>
<b>my rightful throne.</b>

17:05.959 --> 17:07.127
<b>- Welcome back, Cleen.</b>

17:07.227 --> 17:09.762
<b>As a veteran, you fought</b>
<b>through this competition once.</b>

17:09.829 --> 17:13.165
<b>You now have the power to choose</b>
<b>the next elimination tattoo.</b>

17:13.267 --> 17:15.769
<b>This week,</b>
<b>you're calling the shots.</b>

17:15.836 --> 17:17.938
<b>What's the next</b>
<b>elimination tattoo?</b>

17:18.038 --> 17:21.074
<b> <i>[dramatic music]</i> </b>

17:21.174 --> 17:22.943
<b>- We're gonna do</b>
<b>hot rods and choppers,</b>

17:23.042 --> 17:24.478
<b>neo-traditional style.</b>

17:25.546 --> 17:27.414
<b>- [bleep].</b> <b>Not my strong point.</b>

17:27.513 --> 17:29.416
<b>- Probably half the guys here</b>
<b>don't know [bleep]</b>

17:29.516 --> 17:30.784
<b>about hot rods and choppers.</b>

17:30.884 --> 17:32.486
<b> <i>I'm a gearhead.</i> </b>
<b> <i>I'm gonna kill this tattoo.</i> </b>

17:32.586 --> 17:35.289
<b>And there ain't nobody</b>
<b>gonna get in my way.</b>

17:35.389 --> 17:36.390
<b>- Cleen, have a seat.</b>

17:36.490 --> 17:37.824
<b> <i>- Hot rods and choppers</i> </b>
<b> <i>are difficult,</i> </b>

17:37.925 --> 17:40.627
<b>because they don't really lend</b>
<b>themselves well to a tattoo.</b>

17:40.794 --> 17:41.962
<b> <i>They don't flow.</i> </b>
<b> <i>they don't move well.</i> </b>

17:42.062 --> 17:44.665
<b>It's a bunch of little parts</b>
<b>all jumbled together.</b>

17:44.798 --> 17:45.799
<b>I don't like it.</b>

17:45.866 --> 17:49.002
<b>- Remember, you are being judged</b>
<b>on contrast.</b>

17:49.102 --> 17:52.739
<b>Neo-traditional tattoos are</b>
<b>the ideal test of contrast,</b>

17:52.773 --> 17:54.541
<b>because they have bold outlines</b>
<b>and heavy blacks</b>

17:54.641 --> 17:57.978
<b>set against a bright</b>
<b>color palette, making them pop.</b>

17:58.078 --> 17:59.146
<b>- Whew.</b>

17:59.246 --> 18:00.747
<b>- Let's meet your canvases.</b>

18:05.752 --> 18:08.555
<b>Ashley and Alex, you won</b>
<b>the flash challenge.</b>

18:08.655 --> 18:11.758
<b>You now have the power to assign</b>
<b>the canvases as a team.</b>

18:11.825 --> 18:16.530
<b>This advantage can make you</b>
<b>or break you, so choose wisely.</b>

18:18.765 --> 18:20.467
<b>- The message that I'm sending</b>
<b>with the skull pick</b>

18:20.567 --> 18:23.036
<b> <i>is that the veterans</i> </b>
<b> <i>aren't welcome.</i> </b>

18:23.136 --> 18:25.339
<b>I'm gonna make sure that</b>
<b>they get the hardest canvas.</b>

18:25.439 --> 18:26.473
<b>What were you interested</b>
<b>in getting?</b>

18:26.573 --> 18:29.009
<b>- I want a old-school bobber</b>
<b>on my left calf.</b>

18:29.109 --> 18:30.410
<b>Ghost Rider beside it.</b> <b>- Okay.</b>

18:30.510 --> 18:33.580
<b>- I want my Harley Low Rider</b>
<b>on my upper right with flowers.</b>

18:33.680 --> 18:34.948
<b>- I want my chopper...</b>
<b>- Okay.</b>

18:35.048 --> 18:36.316
<b>- On my ribs.</b>

18:36.416 --> 18:37.484
<b>- [whistles]</b>

18:38.785 --> 18:41.221
<b>- Sitting for six hours</b>
<b>for a rib piece</b>

18:41.321 --> 18:42.589
<b>is really grueling,</b>

18:42.689 --> 18:45.359
<b> <i>and motorcycles have</i> </b>
<b> <i>100 parts to them.</i> </b>

18:45.459 --> 18:47.494
<b>That's just unrealistic.</b>

18:47.594 --> 18:50.130
<b>- I want a Firebird Trans Am</b>
<b>on the back of my right arm</b>

18:50.230 --> 18:51.565
<b>with a pinup girl on it.</b>

18:51.732 --> 18:53.634
<b>- That's a lot</b>
<b>for that little space.</b>

18:56.069 --> 18:57.604
<b> <i>- This chick is crazy.</i> </b>

18:57.738 --> 18:58.839
<b>She wants a pinup sitting</b>
<b>on the hood of a hot rod</b>

18:58.939 --> 19:02.476
<b>on the back of her arm,</b>
<b>and it's this big around.</b>

19:02.576 --> 19:03.810
<b> <i>There's no way.</i> </b>

19:03.911 --> 19:06.031
<b>- You want to go talk somewhere?</b>
<b>- Talk about... okay.</b>

19:06.113 --> 19:07.848
<b>- This is so [bleep] exciting.</b>

19:07.948 --> 19:10.150
<b> <i>Ashley and Alex are</i> </b>
<b> <i>probably thinking</i> </b>

19:10.250 --> 19:11.919
<b>that they're gonna</b> <b>"stump me."</b>

19:12.019 --> 19:13.554
<b> <i>I know they're gonna be</i> </b>
<b> <i>gunning for me</i> </b>

19:13.654 --> 19:16.156
<b>because I came in second and</b>
<b>they're just little nobodies.</b>

19:16.256 --> 19:17.658
<b> <i>Guess what?</i> </b> <b> <i>It doesn't matter.</i> </b>

19:17.758 --> 19:20.561
<b>I'll knock out of the park</b>
<b>any tattoo that's thrown at me.</b>

19:21.962 --> 19:24.264
<b>- Canvases, one by one,</b>
<b>please read the artist's name</b>

19:24.364 --> 19:27.100
<b>on the bottom of your skull.</b>

19:27.200 --> 19:28.101
<b>- Picasso.</b>

19:28.202 --> 19:29.002
<b>- What's up?</b>

19:29.102 --> 19:31.838
<b>- Ashley.</b>

19:31.939 --> 19:32.939
<b>- Anthony.</b>

19:38.111 --> 19:40.247
<b> <i>[dramatic music]</i> </b>

19:40.347 --> 19:41.347
<b>- Cleen.</b>

19:43.884 --> 19:45.919
<b>- Tattoos on the ribs</b>
<b>is no big deal.</b>

19:46.019 --> 19:48.755
<b>I'll take any of 'em.</b>
<b>This is my challenge.</b>

19:48.855 --> 19:50.624
<b> <i>If you come into this</i> </b>
<b> <i>calling the shots</i> </b>

19:50.724 --> 19:52.626
<b>and you lose</b>
<b>on your own challenge day,</b>

19:52.726 --> 19:54.194
<b>you're a [bleep] loser!</b>

19:54.294 --> 19:55.294
<b>- Megan Jean.</b>

19:56.964 --> 19:57.831
<b>- Christian.</b>

19:57.931 --> 20:00.734
<b>- Alex.</b>

20:00.834 --> 20:01.834
<b>- Chris.</b>

20:06.974 --> 20:07.974
<b>- Dun dun dun.</b>

20:08.508 --> 20:11.078
<b>- St. Marq.</b>

20:11.178 --> 20:12.479
<b>- They give me that girl</b>
<b>that wants a pinup girl</b>

20:12.579 --> 20:14.414
<b> <i>sitting on top of a Trans Am</i> </b>

20:14.514 --> 20:17.784
<b>on an arm that's</b>
<b>about this wide.</b>

20:17.885 --> 20:19.519
<b> <i>This is Cleen Rock One's</i> </b>
<b> <i>challenge.</i> </b>

20:19.620 --> 20:20.954
<b>They should be gunning for him.</b>

20:22.522 --> 20:24.825
<b>- Remember,</b>
<b>after the elimination tattoo,</b>

20:24.925 --> 20:27.995
<b>the human canvas jury will vote</b>
<b>on the one tattoo</b>

20:28.095 --> 20:29.763
<b>that they think is the worst</b>

20:29.796 --> 20:31.798
<b>and put that artist</b>
<b>up for elimination.</b>

20:32.866 --> 20:35.269
<b>You will have six hours</b>
<b>to tattoo</b>

20:35.369 --> 20:37.838
<b>a neo-traditional hot rod</b>
<b>or chopper,</b>

20:37.938 --> 20:42.209
<b>and based on your work,</b>
<b>one of you will close shop.</b>

20:42.309 --> 20:44.111
<b>Good luck.</b>

20:44.211 --> 20:45.546
<b>- Great to meet you.</b>

20:45.646 --> 20:46.213
<b>- Let's go into the station.</b>
<b>We'll talk.</b>

20:46.313 --> 20:47.581
<b>- Oh, there it is.</b>

20:47.714 --> 20:49.716
<b> <i>- Cleen chooses</i> </b> <b> <i>neo-traditional,</i> </b>

20:49.816 --> 20:52.452
<b>which is a style known</b>
<b>for lots of bright colors.</b>

20:52.553 --> 20:54.388
<b> <i>Perfect opportunity</i> </b>
<b> <i>for all these artists</i> </b>

20:54.488 --> 20:56.323
<b>to really show</b>
<b>a lot of contrast.</b>

20:56.423 --> 20:58.325
<b>- I want to give you</b>
<b>a great tattoo,</b>

20:58.425 --> 20:59.626
<b>but I also want to win</b>
<b>this challenge.</b>

20:59.726 --> 21:01.028
<b>- Yeah, I understand that.</b>

21:01.128 --> 21:02.195
<b>- The title of Ink Master</b>

21:02.296 --> 21:04.498
<b>literally slipped</b>
<b>through Cleen's fingertips.</b>

21:04.598 --> 21:05.866
<b> <i>He's gonna be</i> </b>
<b> <i>one of the veterans that wants</i> </b>

21:05.966 --> 21:08.168
<b>the most revenge coming back</b>
<b>into this competition.</b>

21:08.268 --> 21:09.903
<b>- Soon as I walked in, I said,</b>
<b>"That's who I want."</b>

21:10.003 --> 21:11.805
<b>- Super awesome.</b>
<b>Where you puttin' it at?</b>

21:11.905 --> 21:12.539
<b>- You put it on there</b>
<b>where you want to do it,</b>

21:12.639 --> 21:14.841
<b>and I'm happy with it.</b>

21:14.942 --> 21:17.211
<b> <i>- My guy wanted a chopper</i> </b>
<b> <i>on his ribs, but guess what?</i> </b>

21:17.311 --> 21:18.745
<b>He's a huge fan.</b>

21:18.845 --> 21:20.180
<b> <i>He's gonna let me do</i> </b>
<b> <i>whatever I want!</i> </b>

21:20.280 --> 21:22.561
<b>- Check out some of my stuff</b>
<b>while I'm getting this going.</b>

21:22.616 --> 21:24.518
<b>- Oh, I've seen your stuff.</b>
<b>- Okay.</b>

21:24.618 --> 21:26.253
<b>She happens to be a fan.</b>

21:26.353 --> 21:29.189
<b>I'm gonna turn on the charm</b>
<b>to make this work for me.</b>

21:29.289 --> 21:30.424
<b>- I don't think I can do</b>
<b>a pinup.</b>

21:30.524 --> 21:31.425
<b>That would almost be</b>
<b>like two challenges at once.</b>

21:31.525 --> 21:32.685
<b>- Okay.</b>
<b>- If you could be okay</b>

21:32.759 --> 21:34.895
<b>with centering on the car</b>
<b>so I can...</b>

21:34.995 --> 21:36.363
<b>- Yeah, of course.</b>
<b>- As good as I can.</b>

21:36.463 --> 21:37.497
<b> <i>Maybe these newbies</i> </b>
<b> <i>don't understand</i> </b>

21:37.598 --> 21:39.399
<b> <i>something</i> </b>
<b> <i>about Cleen Rock One and I.</i> </b>

21:39.499 --> 21:41.468
<b>We're not going anywhere.</b>

21:41.568 --> 21:43.403
<b>- Truthfully, I was hoping</b>
<b>that I got you.</b>

21:43.503 --> 21:44.503
<b>- Awesome.</b>

21:44.838 --> 21:46.440
<b>- How similar</b>
<b>does that look to you?</b>

21:46.540 --> 21:48.775
<b>- No, I took</b>
<b>my turn signals off,</b>

21:48.876 --> 21:50.077
<b>so I don't want them on there.</b>

21:50.177 --> 21:51.845
<b>- Okay, that's these</b>
<b>little blinker things here?</b>

21:51.945 --> 21:53.881
<b>- Yes.</b>
<b>You better know a turn signal.</b>

21:53.981 --> 21:54.781
<b> <i>- I thought I picked</i> </b>
<b> <i>the cool chick,</i> </b>

21:54.882 --> 21:56.984
<b>but this woman's</b>
<b>extremely picky.</b>

21:57.084 --> 21:58.785
<b>- That's a super-wide.</b>
<b>That's not mine.</b>

21:58.886 --> 22:00.821
<b>That's a custom,</b>
<b>looks like a different frame.</b>

22:00.921 --> 22:01.488
<b>- She's talking about</b>
<b>the different [bleep] parts</b>

22:01.588 --> 22:03.624
<b>to the motorcycle.</b>

22:03.724 --> 22:04.725
<b> <i>I don't know what</i> </b>
<b> <i>she's taking about.</i> </b>

22:04.791 --> 22:06.326
<b>- And I had an idea you'd do</b>

22:06.426 --> 22:07.866
<b>the front end coming</b>
<b>out of a flower.</b>

22:07.928 --> 22:10.631
<b>- I know I'm going home if I</b>
<b>don't figure out how to do this.</b>

22:18.080 --> 22:19.781
<b>- You guys got</b>
<b>some skin rips, right?</b>

22:19.881 --> 22:21.616
<b>- Do we have those, skin rips?</b>

22:21.717 --> 22:22.684
<b>Is that actually</b>
<b>part of the thing?</b>

22:22.784 --> 22:23.784
<b>- Yeah.</b>

22:24.920 --> 22:27.489
<b>- Cool, look at you, gangster.</b>

22:28.557 --> 22:30.659
<b>- [bleep] yeah.</b>

22:30.759 --> 22:31.493
<b>- Right on.</b>
<b>- Dude, be careful.</b>

22:31.593 --> 22:32.594
<b>We have to do skin rips.</b>

22:32.694 --> 22:33.695
<b>- No, we don't.</b>

22:33.795 --> 22:34.795
<b>- That's what he said.</b>

22:34.830 --> 22:36.164
<b>- [chuckles]</b>

22:36.264 --> 22:38.667
<b>- No, he just talking [bleep].</b>
<b>That's Cleen.</b>

22:38.767 --> 22:39.267
<b>- You took me seriously?</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

22:39.368 --> 22:40.802
<b>- Holy [bleep].</b>

22:40.902 --> 22:43.171
<b>This is gonna be</b>
<b>[bleep] awesome!</b>

22:43.271 --> 22:44.639
<b>[laughs]</b>

22:44.740 --> 22:46.441
<b>Welcome to "Ink Master."</b>

22:46.541 --> 22:48.610
<b>- Cleen Rock One walks in</b>
<b>like he owns the place.</b>

22:48.710 --> 22:50.045
<b>He's a bully.</b>

22:50.145 --> 22:52.814
<b>- You [bleep] don't even know</b>
<b>what's in store for you.</b>

22:56.985 --> 22:58.945
<b>- All right, artists,</b>
<b>you have six hours to tattoo</b>

22:58.987 --> 23:02.724
<b>a neo-traditional hot rod</b>
<b>or chopper,</b>

23:02.824 --> 23:06.194
<b>and your time starts now.</b>

23:06.294 --> 23:07.662
<b>- All right, let's do this.</b>
<b>- Let's go.</b>

23:07.763 --> 23:09.297
<b>- Put the stencil on ya.</b>

23:09.398 --> 23:11.466
<b>- When you're doing</b>
<b>hot rods and choppers,</b>

23:11.566 --> 23:12.901
<b> <i>you want to make 'em dynamic.</i> </b>

23:13.001 --> 23:14.903
<b> <i>The only way to make</i> </b>
<b> <i>something dynamic</i> </b>

23:15.003 --> 23:17.005
<b> <i>is to bump up the contrast</i> </b>
<b> <i>with a lot of black</i> </b>

23:17.105 --> 23:19.074
<b>and a lot of bright,</b>
<b>solid, bold color.</b>

23:19.174 --> 23:21.043
<b> <i>Without that, we're gonna</i> </b>
<b> <i>really have a flat tattoo,</i> </b>

23:21.143 --> 23:22.144
<b>and it'll be easy to pick apart.</b>

23:22.244 --> 23:25.347
<b>- Whatever you do,</b>
<b>lay perfectly still.</b>

23:30.485 --> 23:31.485
<b>- Oh, fine.</b>

23:33.221 --> 23:35.524
<b> <i>- I found something that's</i> </b>
<b> <i>a close match to her bike,</i> </b>

23:35.624 --> 23:38.393
<b>so I was able to do a</b>
<b>neo-traditional rendering of it.</b>

23:39.327 --> 23:40.996
<b>- I am.</b>

23:41.096 --> 23:42.097
<b>- I want to go back home</b>
<b>and say,</b>

23:42.197 --> 23:43.365
<b>"You know what?</b>
<b>This chick rocked it."</b>

23:43.465 --> 23:44.466
<b> <i>- My canvas loves it.</i> </b>

23:44.566 --> 23:46.568
<b> <i>It's boosting up my ego</i> </b>
<b> <i>a little bit.</i> </b>

23:46.668 --> 23:48.108
<b>I think I'm gonna do</b>
<b>[bleep] awesome.</b>

23:49.971 --> 23:51.073
<b>I'm gonna kill this tattoo.</b>

23:51.173 --> 23:52.941
<b>- What are we doing?</b>
<b>- How you doing, man?</b>

23:53.008 --> 23:54.476
<b>So that's just the V engine</b>
<b>of your bike?</b>

23:54.576 --> 23:57.045
<b>- Time wise, you know,</b>
<b>I figured let's just make</b>

23:57.145 --> 23:58.385
<b>the motor</b> <b>nice and beefy and...</b>

24:00.816 --> 24:02.651
<b>- As a veteran artist,</b>
<b>my strategy is</b>

24:02.751 --> 24:05.220
<b> <i>to do good, solid,</i> </b>
<b> <i>clean tattoos.</i> </b>

24:05.320 --> 24:07.856
<b>I've been preparing for this</b>
<b>since season five.</b>

24:09.958 --> 24:11.426
<b>- Three hours to go.</b>

24:14.763 --> 24:16.431
<b>It's kind of a classic image,</b>
<b>so...</b>

24:18.967 --> 24:20.135
<b> <i>I'm anxious.</i> </b>

24:20.235 --> 24:22.971
<b>I have technical skills.</b>
<b>I have the artistic ability.</b>

24:23.071 --> 24:25.273
<b>I got the talent.</b>
<b>This pressure is, like...</b>

24:25.374 --> 24:27.642
<b>Oh, man, it's way different</b>
<b>than what I thought.</b>

24:29.044 --> 24:30.244
<b>- That's looking badass, dude.</b>

24:31.013 --> 24:32.914
<b>- I ran away</b>
<b>when I was, like, 12,</b>

24:33.015 --> 24:35.117
<b> <i>lived on the street,</i> </b>
<b> <i>in and out of juvie.</i> </b>

24:35.217 --> 24:37.386
<b> <i>It was either do something</i> </b>
<b> <i>with your life</i> </b>

24:37.486 --> 24:39.955
<b>or just rot in jail.</b>

24:40.055 --> 24:41.923
<b> <i>When I found tattooing,</i> </b>

24:41.957 --> 24:43.592
<b> <i>it was the perfect thing</i> </b>
<b> <i>for my artistic talent.</i> </b>

24:43.692 --> 24:47.029
<b>I came here to win,</b>
<b>and that's what I'm gonna do.</b>

24:48.563 --> 24:49.931
<b>- Definitely feeling color?</b>

24:49.965 --> 24:51.433
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- Yeah, I think so too.</b>

24:52.768 --> 24:54.002
<b>What is that?</b>

24:56.938 --> 24:58.106
<b>Right there.</b>

24:58.206 --> 24:59.274
<b>- Let me grab the picture.</b>

24:59.374 --> 25:00.475
<b>- I don't understand</b>
<b>what this is.</b>

25:00.575 --> 25:02.844
<b>- That's the... like,</b>
<b>the other side of the bike,</b>

25:02.944 --> 25:04.680
<b>like, if you're</b>
<b>seeing through it.</b>

25:04.780 --> 25:07.382
<b>- Now you have</b>
<b>an extra line there.</b>

25:07.482 --> 25:08.482
<b>This is screwed up.</b>

25:08.517 --> 25:09.751
<b>- Okay.</b>
<b>- I don't know what this is.</b>

25:09.851 --> 25:11.219
<b>You got these [bleep] up</b>
<b>with this.</b>

25:11.319 --> 25:12.154
<b>- Okay.</b>

25:12.254 --> 25:13.255
<b>- This is your frame.</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

25:13.355 --> 25:14.690
<b>- You have to get that pipe</b>
<b>into there.</b>

25:14.790 --> 25:16.224
<b>- Okay.</b>

25:16.324 --> 25:17.159
<b> <i>How the [bleep] did she go</i> </b>
<b> <i>from liking the drawing</i> </b>

25:17.259 --> 25:19.461
<b>to now having a complete issue?</b>

25:19.561 --> 25:22.898
<b>- This needs to go under, hon,</b>
<b>is what you're saying?</b>

25:22.964 --> 25:24.132
<b>- Yeah, but you already drew</b>
<b>the outline.</b>

25:24.232 --> 25:25.467
<b>- No, no, no.</b>
<b>- You can't...</b>

25:25.567 --> 25:26.902
<b>- I'm just asking, do you want</b>
<b>me to straighten that out?</b>

25:27.002 --> 25:28.904
<b>- There's no way.</b>

25:28.937 --> 25:30.005
<b>- I can.</b>

25:30.105 --> 25:31.305
<b>I'm gonna do whatever it takes</b>

25:31.339 --> 25:33.742
<b>to get her to stop complaining</b>
<b>and nitpicking.</b>

25:33.909 --> 25:35.109
<b>- Make it good.</b>
<b>- Make it good.</b>

25:35.143 --> 25:37.546
<b>If I don't finish this tattoo,</b>
<b>I'm [bleep].</b>

25:39.514 --> 25:40.615
<b>- Happy tattooing.</b>

25:40.716 --> 25:41.917
<b> <i>You can tell</i> </b>
<b> <i>that Ashley's canvas is pissed,</i> </b>

25:41.950 --> 25:43.618
<b>and I love it.</b>

25:43.719 --> 25:46.188
<b>[laughs]</b>

25:46.288 --> 25:47.422
<b> <i>Her and Alex tried</i> </b>
<b> <i>to screw me over.</i> </b>

25:47.522 --> 25:49.458
<b>Maybe these newbies</b>
<b>don't understand.</b>

25:49.558 --> 25:51.827
<b>St. Marq is not a guy</b>
<b>to be [bleep] with.</b>

25:51.927 --> 25:53.528
<b>- Nice, nice.</b>

25:57.632 --> 25:58.800
<b>- Oh, my goodness.</b>

25:58.934 --> 26:00.635
<b>- They may have been able</b>
<b>to make me lose my footing</b>

26:00.736 --> 26:03.271
<b> <i>on my first tattoo, but</i> </b>
<b> <i>I'm getting comfortable again.</i> </b>

26:03.372 --> 26:05.340
<b>I think they should be</b>
<b>shaking in their boots.</b>

26:08.677 --> 26:09.677
<b>- Two more hours.</b>

26:12.714 --> 26:15.350
<b>- The contest is contrast.</b>

26:15.450 --> 26:16.451
<b>I think we already have</b>
<b>a [bleep]-ton of it.</b>

26:16.551 --> 26:19.454
<b> <i>St. Marq likes to talk</i> </b>
<b> <i>a lot of trash,</i> </b>

26:19.554 --> 26:21.356
<b>but just because</b>
<b>you've been here before,</b>

26:21.456 --> 26:23.191
<b> <i>it doesn't mean you can</i> </b>
<b> <i>out-tattoo me.</i> </b>

26:23.291 --> 26:24.891
<b>Tried to simplify it</b>
<b>for neo-traditional.</b>

27:01.096 --> 27:02.230
<b>[hums]</b>

27:10.305 --> 27:13.975
<b>- Five, four, three, two, one.</b>

27:14.076 --> 27:15.210
<b>That is it. Time is up.</b>

27:15.310 --> 27:19.348
<b>Machines down.</b> <b>No more ink.</b>

27:19.448 --> 27:20.882
<b>- All right, come on over.</b>

27:20.916 --> 27:22.417
<b>- That is badass.</b>

27:22.517 --> 27:24.419
<b>- I'll tell you right now,</b>
<b>if I don't win this one,</b>

27:24.519 --> 27:27.422
<b>by looking these other chumps'</b>
<b>tattoos, this [bleep]'s rigged.</b>

27:27.522 --> 27:29.725
<b>- Oh, my God,</b>
<b>I absolutely love this.</b>

27:29.891 --> 27:31.393
<b>- St. Marq's tattoo looks</b>
<b>like an airbrushed T-shirt.</b>

27:31.493 --> 27:34.162
<b> <i>Christian's tattoo looks boring.</i> </b>

27:34.262 --> 27:34.996
<b> <i>Ashley's tattoo</i> </b>
<b> <i>looks like [bleep].</i> </b>

27:35.097 --> 27:37.199
<b>This is just a joke.</b>

27:38.767 --> 27:39.767
<b>Kick rocks.</b>

27:40.736 --> 27:42.771
<b>- You guys walked in</b>
<b>cocky and confident,</b>

27:42.904 --> 27:45.974
<b>and we've got the skill set</b>
<b>to take you guys down.</b>

27:46.074 --> 27:47.209
<b>This is our house now.</b>

27:47.309 --> 27:47.909
<b>- That's not how this</b>
<b>competition works.</b>

27:47.943 --> 27:49.978
<b>- You did this?</b>

27:50.078 --> 27:51.313
<b>You get a bad reference,</b>
<b>you get a bad canvas,</b>

27:51.413 --> 27:52.981
<b>you get a bad tattoo,</b>
<b>you get a bad critique,</b>

27:53.081 --> 27:54.649
<b>you can go home.</b>

28:01.691 --> 28:03.411
<b>- With you and St. Marq both,</b>
<b>I kind of felt</b>

28:03.493 --> 28:05.728
<b>like you guys walked in</b>
<b>cocky and confident</b>

28:05.828 --> 28:08.665
<b>and thought we just weren't</b>
<b>gonna be any kind of challenge.</b>

28:08.765 --> 28:10.400
<b>We've got the skill set</b>
<b>to take you guys down.</b>

28:10.500 --> 28:12.368
<b>- I don't agree with that.</b>

28:12.468 --> 28:13.970
<b>- You keep up</b>
<b>that level of arrogance,</b>

28:14.070 --> 28:15.071
<b>and you're gonna walk out</b>

28:15.171 --> 28:16.451
<b>the same way you did</b>
<b>last season.</b>

28:16.506 --> 28:17.674
<b>- There's a huge difference</b>
<b>between knowing</b>

28:17.774 --> 28:20.643
<b>what you're capable of</b>
<b>and then knowing</b>

28:20.743 --> 28:22.378
<b>that you're better</b>
<b>than somebody.</b>

28:22.478 --> 28:23.813
<b>- The way that you guys carry</b>
<b>yourselves...</b>

28:23.913 --> 28:24.981
<b>- So I should totally sit here</b>
<b>and say, "You know what?</b>"

28:25.081 --> 28:26.983
<b>Everybody's better than me"...</b>

28:27.083 --> 28:28.117
<b>- No.</b> <b>No, that's not it at all.</b>

28:28.217 --> 28:29.352
<b>- "Yeah, you know what?</b>
<b>I haven't"...</b>

28:29.452 --> 28:31.254
<b>- [bleep], you're not in a house</b>
<b>like last season</b>

28:31.354 --> 28:32.956
<b>where you're gonna</b>
<b>talk over everybody</b>

28:33.056 --> 28:34.857
<b>and you're gonna bully</b>
<b>everybody.</b>

28:34.958 --> 28:37.660
<b>All you veterans are gonna walk</b>
<b>in and be like, "Oh, [bleep].</b>"

28:37.760 --> 28:39.429
<b>I've been here before.</b>
<b>Where's my bunk?"</b>

28:39.529 --> 28:41.164
<b>Well, you know what?</b>
<b>It's off in the corner.</b>

28:41.264 --> 28:42.699
<b>'Cause this is our house now.</b>

28:42.799 --> 28:44.467
<b>- That's not how this</b>
<b>competition works.</b>

28:44.567 --> 28:46.127
<b>- Oh, it is.</b>
<b>We'll show you. You'll see.</b>

28:56.179 --> 28:59.115
<b> <i>[dramatic music]</i> </b>

28:59.148 --> 29:00.416
<b> <i>♪</i> </b>

29:00.516 --> 29:03.319
<b>- Today Cleen challenged you</b>
<b>to tattoo symbols of speed,</b>

29:03.419 --> 29:07.123
<b>hot rods and choppers</b>
<b>in neo-traditional style.</b>

29:07.223 --> 29:09.592
<b>Cleen, let's start with you.</b>

29:10.460 --> 29:12.462
<b>When you said</b> <b>neo-traditional,</b>

29:12.562 --> 29:13.630
<b>this was the palette</b>

29:13.730 --> 29:15.665
<b>that I expected to see</b>
<b>from the field.</b>

29:15.765 --> 29:17.767
<b>I like the flames,</b>
<b>the engine is very identifiable,</b>

29:17.867 --> 29:20.303
<b>and I like what you did</b>
<b>with his background.</b>

29:20.403 --> 29:21.643
<b>- I think that's the best part.</b>

29:21.671 --> 29:23.172
<b>Red, white, and blue, baby.</b>
<b>American.</b>

29:23.273 --> 29:23.873
<b>- That's not American, Cleen.</b>

29:23.973 --> 29:25.408
<b>- It's American.</b>

29:25.508 --> 29:26.542
<b>- That's a Puerto Rican flag.</b>

29:26.643 --> 29:28.177
<b>- He gave him</b>
<b>a Puerto Rican flag.</b>

29:28.278 --> 29:30.213
<b>- I see the discrepancies</b>
<b>with the flag.</b>

29:30.313 --> 29:31.514
<b>Putting more stars</b>
<b>in the blue area</b>

29:31.614 --> 29:33.734
<b>instead of one big white star</b>
<b>would've helped you out,</b>

29:33.816 --> 29:36.553
<b>but no one can argue</b>
<b>with this line work.</b>

29:36.653 --> 29:38.288
<b>Nobody can argue</b>
<b>with your saturation.</b>

29:38.388 --> 29:40.189
<b>The details of this motor</b>
<b>are right.</b>

29:40.290 --> 29:41.290
<b>It's a very slick tattoo.</b>

29:44.394 --> 29:45.528
<b>- Christian.</b>

29:47.297 --> 29:48.598
<b>- Looking at the tattoo overall,</b>

29:48.698 --> 29:50.466
<b>it's so readable</b>
<b>from a distance.</b>

29:50.567 --> 29:52.435
<b>It's just</b>
<b>a sticker-like quality.</b>

29:52.535 --> 29:54.938
<b>- From a distance,</b>
<b>it screams contrast.</b>

29:55.104 --> 29:57.640
<b>The purple in the ocean goes</b>
<b>along with the blue in the car.</b>

29:57.740 --> 30:00.209
<b>That whole ground scene</b>
<b>is cold hues,</b>

30:00.310 --> 30:01.844
<b>and then the sky seems</b>
<b>super hot.</b>

30:01.945 --> 30:03.425
<b>You didn't jump away</b>
<b>from a challenge.</b>

30:03.479 --> 30:05.715
<b>You just gave him</b>
<b>exactly what he wanted.</b>

30:07.216 --> 30:08.216
<b>- Picasso.</b>

30:10.620 --> 30:12.956
<b>- Great drawing,</b>
<b>really cool to look at.</b>

30:13.122 --> 30:15.242
<b>The biggest thing that I could</b>
<b>pick out in this tattoo</b>

30:15.325 --> 30:17.293
<b>is that you just don't</b>
<b>completely commit</b>

30:17.393 --> 30:19.495
<b>to actual dark, deep black.</b>

30:19.596 --> 30:22.131
<b>See how good the denim looks</b>
<b>and all the great folds</b>

30:22.165 --> 30:23.866
<b>and the dynamic look to that?</b>

30:23.967 --> 30:27.570
<b>Just a little bit of a richer,</b>
<b>darker, deep-set tone in there</b>

30:27.670 --> 30:30.673
<b>in the dark areas, and then</b>
<b>they jump off of that tank.</b>

30:30.773 --> 30:33.042
<b>- I felt like first time,</b>
<b>I did too much.</b>

30:33.142 --> 30:34.544
<b>I'm still finding my place.</b>

30:34.644 --> 30:36.679
<b>- The only person that's gonna</b>
<b>beat you is gonna be you.</b>

30:36.779 --> 30:38.139
<b>Let it all go.</b>
<b>Just do what you do.</b>

30:40.316 --> 30:42.151
<b>- Ashley.</b>

30:44.153 --> 30:47.156
<b>- The mechanics of this</b>
<b>motorcycle do not line up.</b>

30:47.257 --> 30:49.492
<b>When it's a tattoo that's gonna</b>
<b>be on this lady's arm forever</b>

30:49.592 --> 30:51.494
<b>and she's gonna be hanging out</b>
<b>with motorcycle people,</b>

30:51.594 --> 30:52.754
<b>they're gonna make fun of her.</b>

30:52.795 --> 30:53.730
<b>Everybody's gonna look</b>
<b>at this tattoo,</b>

30:53.830 --> 30:54.964
<b>and they're gonna make jokes</b>

30:55.098 --> 30:57.018
<b>about how her forks</b>
<b>disappear into the headlight.</b>

30:57.100 --> 30:59.602
<b>- Well, the motorcycle expert,</b>
<b>which she was,</b>

30:59.702 --> 31:02.005
<b>she could've done her job</b>
<b>as a canvas.</b>

31:02.105 --> 31:04.440
<b>She was the expert.</b>
<b>I was the artist, doing my job.</b>

31:04.540 --> 31:06.542
<b>- So you did this?</b>

31:06.643 --> 31:08.083
<b>- I don't think</b>
<b>I should be penalized</b>

31:08.111 --> 31:09.712
<b>for something</b>
<b>I don't understand.</b>

31:09.812 --> 31:11.347
<b>- Well, unfortunately,</b>
<b>you get a bad reference,</b>

31:11.447 --> 31:12.849
<b>you get a bad canvas,</b>
<b>you get a bad tattoo,</b>

31:12.949 --> 31:14.951
<b>you get a bad critique,</b>
<b>you might go home.</b>

31:18.555 --> 31:19.722
<b>- Anthony.</b>

31:20.990 --> 31:23.070
<b>- This tattoo actually shows</b>
<b>a lot of great contrast,</b>

31:23.126 --> 31:25.461
<b>'cause it's really dark,</b>
<b>but all the shading</b>

31:25.562 --> 31:27.522
<b>and all the highlights are</b>
<b>in just the right place</b>

31:27.597 --> 31:29.299
<b>to highlight each angle,</b>
<b>each crease,</b>

31:29.399 --> 31:30.934
<b>each pipe, each foot peg.</b>

31:31.034 --> 31:33.169
<b>Everything stands out.</b>
<b>It's very clear.</b>

31:33.269 --> 31:36.506
<b>- Perfect, perfect example</b>
<b>of how to make something</b>

31:36.606 --> 31:39.008
<b>very dark and still</b>
<b>show off great detail.</b>

31:39.142 --> 31:41.878
<b>Overall, man, it's really clean,</b>
<b>quality work.</b>

31:44.213 --> 31:45.213
<b>- Chris.</b>

31:45.748 --> 31:47.650
<b>There's not a whole lot</b>

31:47.750 --> 31:49.430
<b>of neo-traditional elements</b>
<b>to this tattoo.</b>

31:52.155 --> 31:54.324
<b>- It's a contrast challenge,</b>
<b>and we're missing</b>

31:54.424 --> 31:55.725
<b>a lot of contrast in this piece.</b>

31:55.825 --> 31:58.228
<b>I'm having a hard time</b>
<b>reading that bike.</b>

31:58.328 --> 31:59.896
<b>- Design choices are</b>
<b>very strange.</b>

31:59.996 --> 32:01.864
<b>You got one cheek wing,</b>
<b>no wing on the other side.</b>

32:01.965 --> 32:03.766
<b>The way you have</b>
<b>this motorcycle wheel</b>

32:03.866 --> 32:05.668
<b>disappearing into the eye</b>
<b>of the skull,</b>

32:05.768 --> 32:07.870
<b>it's a hard-to-read tattoo.</b>

32:07.971 --> 32:09.772
<b>There's a lot of messy details.</b>

32:09.872 --> 32:11.541
<b>For a contrast challenge,</b>
<b>you want the details</b>

32:11.641 --> 32:12.641
<b>to stand out strong.</b>

32:12.709 --> 32:14.189
<b>You missed that part</b>
<b>of the challenge.</b>

32:15.378 --> 32:16.579
<b>- Megan Jean.</b>

32:18.715 --> 32:20.183
<b>- I'm not a fan of the drawing.</b>

32:20.283 --> 32:22.118
<b>The car has an awkward shape.</b>

32:22.151 --> 32:23.219
<b>- You just got tunneled.</b>

32:23.319 --> 32:25.039
<b>The front of the car</b>
<b>and the side of the car</b>

32:25.121 --> 32:28.224
<b>all become the same tones, and</b>
<b>your background color choice...</b>

32:28.324 --> 32:31.928
<b>yellow on olive skin...</b>
<b>just doesn't speak to contrast.</b>

32:35.131 --> 32:36.900
<b>- Alex.</b>

32:37.000 --> 32:39.302
<b>- Immediately, I just look</b>
<b>at the two wheels.</b>

32:39.402 --> 32:40.536
<b>They're really tiny.</b>

32:40.637 --> 32:41.638
<b>- 'Cause it was</b>
<b>a really dropped car.</b>

32:41.738 --> 32:42.739
<b>- How far the actual wheel</b>
<b>is recessed</b>

32:42.839 --> 32:45.775
<b>back underneath the fenders</b>

32:45.875 --> 32:47.543
<b>makes that perspective</b>
<b>a little off.</b>

32:47.644 --> 32:48.645
<b>- I definitely wanted</b>
<b>to make sure</b>

32:48.745 --> 32:50.747
<b>I didn't do</b>
<b>too much detail in it.</b>

32:50.847 --> 32:53.349
<b>I definitely wanted to keep</b>
<b>the whole tattoo simplified.</b>

32:53.449 --> 32:55.552
<b>- In looking for contrast,</b>
