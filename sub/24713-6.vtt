WE GOT HIM. WE'RE ASKING
IS THERE ANYONE ELSE?

10:09.317 --> 10:10.901
MY DAUGHTER'S
IN THE HOSPITAL NOW.

10:10.901 --> 10:14.238
LET'S GO CHECK ON HER.
THERE'S NOTHING MORE WE CAN DO.

10:14.238 --> 10:15.906
WE'LL BE
AT JEFFERSON HOSPITAL.

10:24.332 --> 10:26.417
USA! USA!

10:26.417 --> 10:29.503
OH, THIS IS
GONNA SUCK!

10:33.841 --> 10:37.053
I CAN GIVE A MESSAGE--
HOLD ON, HE'S RIGHT HERE.

10:37.053 --> 10:38.554
A COUNSELOR WHO WORKS
AT THE HOSPITAL

10:38.554 --> 10:39.722
CALLED ME FROM HOME.

10:41.849 --> 10:43.225
DETECTIVE CLARK.

10:43.225 --> 10:45.311
NOTHING FROM CRIME SCENE
ON THE PRINTS YET,

10:45.311 --> 10:47.104
AND THAT BLOODHOUND
FROM CANINE UNIT

10:47.104 --> 10:48.314
DIDN'T CATCH A SCENT.

10:48.314 --> 10:49.774
YOU INTERVIEW
ALL THE STAFF?

10:49.774 --> 10:51.817
McDOWELL AND GIBSON
ARE STILL DOING THAT.

10:51.817 --> 10:55.446
WE'VE GOT A LIST OF STAFF
WHO AREN'T SCHEDULED TODAY,

10:55.446 --> 10:57.990
PLUS WOMEN WHO'VE HAD
MISCARRIAGES AND STILLBORNS
IN THE LAST MONTH.

10:57.990 --> 11:00.660
OH, AND A NURSE
GOT A CALL YESTERDAY

11:00.660 --> 11:02.870
ASKING ABOUT
THE WILLIAMS BABY,

11:02.870 --> 11:04.455
BUT NO WILLIAMS
WAS A PATIENT THERE.

11:04.455 --> 11:05.581
YOU TRACE THE CALL?

11:05.581 --> 11:08.167
I PUT A UNIFORM
ON THE MATERNITY SWITCHBOARD

11:08.167 --> 11:09.627
WITH THE CALLER I.D. BOX

11:09.627 --> 11:11.295
IF THEY GET ANY
OTHER CALLS LIKE THAT.

11:11.295 --> 11:12.630
LET'S GO WITH THIS
TO THE LOCAL NEWS,

11:12.630 --> 11:13.964
START GETTING THE WORD OUT,

11:13.964 --> 11:15.508
SEE IF THE PUBLIC
CAN PROVIDE A TIP.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.593
THERE WAS A GRIEF COUNSELOR
WHO MET WITH A WOMAN
THREE DAYS AGO

11:17.593 --> 11:19.887
WHO HAD A STILLBORN.

11:19.887 --> 11:22.556
SHE WAS HYSTERICAL--
SAID SHE'D DO ANYTHING
TO HAVE A BABY.

11:22.556 --> 11:24.600
PROBABLY WORTH LOOKING AT.
SHE LIVES ON THE WEST SIDE.

11:24.600 --> 11:27.853
GET CONNIE TO RESPOND AND KEEP
GIBSON INTERVIEWING STAFF.

11:29.313 --> 11:30.398
SIT DOWN.

11:35.152 --> 11:39.740
MR. PADGETT, GREENWICH TV
GOT TORCHED THIS MORNING.

11:39.740 --> 11:43.577
YEAH, BUMMER, HUH?

11:43.577 --> 11:46.580
LOOKS LIKE YOU HAD A PRETTY
SERIOUS BEEF WITH THE OWNERS.

11:46.580 --> 11:49.917
I'D STOP BY AND GIVE 'EM SOME
ADVICE FROM TIME TO TIME.

11:49.917 --> 11:52.712
WHERE WERE YOU
THIS MORNING AT 8:00?

11:52.712 --> 11:54.171
AT WORK.
WHERE'S WORK?

11:54.171 --> 11:58.217
EDDIE'S BODY AND PAINT.
ASK EDDIE.

11:58.217 --> 12:00.219
ASK HIS WIFE,
SHE KEEPS THE BOOKS.

12:00.219 --> 12:01.554
SO YOU WENT
ACROSS THE STREET

12:01.554 --> 12:03.597
WHEN GREENWICH'S TV
WAS BURNED?

12:03.597 --> 12:06.350
HELL YEAH, I WAS.
ENJOYING THE VIEW.

12:06.350 --> 12:09.145
I HEARD A FIRE TRUCK SO I WENT
TO SEE WHAT THE DEAL WAS.

12:09.145 --> 12:13.482
LISTEN, WE ALL KNOW THESE ARE
ARABS WHO OWN THE PLACE.

12:13.482 --> 12:16.777
SO IF YOU COULDN'T
TAKE IT ANYMORE--

12:16.777 --> 12:18.571
MAYBE YOU LOST SOME PEOPLE
IN THE ATTACKS--

12:18.571 --> 12:20.281
WE CAN UNDERSTAND THAT.

12:20.281 --> 12:22.450
I MEAN, WE'RE AT WAR
WITH THESE PEOPLE.

12:22.450 --> 12:24.702
IF LOOKING AT THESE PEOPLE
EVERY DAY GOT TO YOU--

12:24.702 --> 12:27.538
SEEING HOW GOOD THEY'RE
LIVING IN OUR COUNTRY.

12:27.538 --> 12:29.832
THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE.
YOU SNAP.

12:29.832 --> 12:31.876
WE GET A LOT
OF CASES LIKE THIS,

12:31.876 --> 12:36.172
AND WE'LL WORK IT OUT
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

12:36.172 --> 12:39.633
BUT OUR JOB IS WE GOTTA
FIND OUT WHO DID IT.

12:39.633 --> 12:43.095
NOW, WE CAN HELP HIM
ONCE WE DO, BUT WE

12:43.095 --> 12:46.098
THEN FIND OUT.

12:47.683 --> 12:49.477
WRITE DOWN
YOUR WORK INFO,

12:49.477 --> 12:50.895
SO WE CAN VERIFY IT.

12:54.565 --> 12:57.651
IF IT WAS YOU, CHRIS, OR YOU
KNEW AND DIDN'T TELL US,

12:57.651 --> 12:59.069
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO HELP YOU THEN.

12:59.069 --> 13:01.113
I DON'T KNOW
WHO DID IT.

13:01.113 --> 13:06.494
BUT I DO KNOW--THOSE PEOPLE,
THEY DON'T BELONG HERE ANYMORE.

13:08.913 --> 13:09.955
TAKE OFF.

13:30.893 --> 13:32.645
CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING?

13:32.645 --> 13:34.104
NO, I'M FINE.
THANKS.

13:35.856 --> 13:38.359
WHAT'S THE INVESTIGATION
YOU'RE WORKING ON?

13:38.359 --> 13:41.570
UH, THERE WAS A COMPLAINT
AT JEFFERSON HOSPITAL,

13:41.570 --> 13:43.739
AND WE'RE TALKING TO PEOPLE
WHO STAYED THERE RECENTLY.

13:43.739 --> 13:44.990
OKAY.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.325
YOU WERE DISCHARGED
THREE DAYS AGO?

13:46.325 --> 13:47.326
YES.

13:47.326 --> 13:48.285
WHAT WERE YOU IN FOR?

13:48.285 --> 13:50.412
I WAS IN THE MATERNITY WARD.

13:50.412 --> 13:51.580
HOW IS EVERYTHING?

13:51.580 --> 13:53.290
SHE WAS STILLBORN.

13:53.290 --> 13:54.458
I'M SO SORRY.

13:54.458 --> 13:56.919
WE'VE BEEN TRYING
FOR SO LONG.

13:56.919 --> 13:59.255
$20,000 WE SPENT ON IN VITRO,

13:59.255 --> 14:01.924
AND THEN I GOT PREGNANT
THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY, BUT...

14:01.924 --> 14:03.425
THAT MUST BE VERY HARD.

14:03.425 --> 14:05.845
DO YOU HAVE ANY CHILDREN?

14:05.845 --> 14:07.847
YES, I HAVE A DAUGHTER.

14:07.847 --> 14:08.848
CHERISH HER.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.307
I DO.

14:10.307 --> 14:13.477
SO, WHAT'S THE COMPLAINT
AGAINST THE HOSPITAL?

14:13.477 --> 14:16.063
THERE WAS A BABY TAKEN FROM
THE MATERNITY WARD THIS MORNING.

14:16.063 --> 14:17.982
OH, MY GOD.

14:17.982 --> 14:19.233
WE'RE LOOKING INTO THAT.

14:21.318 --> 14:23.988
DID YOU COME HERE BECAUSE YOU
THOUGHT<i> I </i>STOLE THE BABY?

14:23.988 --> 14:26.866
WELL, WE'RE ASKING A LOT OF
PEOPLE. THAT'S OUR JOB.

14:26.866 --> 14:31.328
I LOSE MY OWN BABY,
I HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT,

14:31.328 --> 14:34.623
AND NOW ON TOP OF IT,
I GET ACCUSED OF STEALING ONE?

14:34.623 --> 14:35.958
I DIDN'T ACCUSE YOU.

14:35.958 --> 14:38.586
YOU KNEW MY BABY WAS STILLBORN
WHEN YOU CAME HERE,

14:38.586 --> 14:39.920
DIDN'T YOU?

14:39.920 --> 14:41.964
IF YOURS WAS TAKEN,
WOULDN'T YOU WANT ME OUT THERE,

14:41.964 --> 14:44.174
FOLLOWING EVERY LEAD I COULD
TRYING TO GET HER BACK?

14:44.174 --> 14:48.387
I DIDN'T STEAL A BABY.
AND YOU CAN GO NOW.

14:48.387 --> 14:51.056
I'M SORRY
FOR WHAT YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH.

15:02.359 --> 15:04.486
ARE YOU SURE UNCLE EDDIE
WON'T BE COMING BACK?

15:04.486 --> 15:06.572
YEAH.
HE'S OUT IN THE FIELD.

15:06.572 --> 15:07.865
THANKS FOR TAKING THE TIME.

15:07.865 --> 15:09.199
I DON'T WANNA BE RUDE,

15:09.199 --> 15:10.910
BUT WE JUST GOT
A MAJOR CASE HERE,

15:10.910 --> 15:12.786
AND I GOTTA HEAD OUT
IN FIVE MINUTES.

15:12.786 --> 15:16.498
I KNOW YOU AND EDDIE HAVE HAD
YOUR DIFFERENCES,

15:16.498 --> 15:18.459
BUT YOU ARE FRIENDS, RIGHT?

15:18.459 --> 15:19.877
SURE.

15:19.877 --> 15:22.922
AND HE'D LISTEN TO YOU,
RIGHT?

15:22.922 --> 15:25.633
AS A FRIEND?
AS A FELLOW COP?

15:25.633 --> 15:26.634
WHAT DO YOU NEED ME TO KNOW?

15:26.634 --> 15:29.219
WE WANT HIM HOME.

15:29.219 --> 15:31.388
HIS WIFE CAROL AND HIS SONS
WANT HIM HOME.

15:31.388 --> 15:32.890
WHY?

15:32.890 --> 15:37.645
BECAUSE HE INSISTS ON WORKING
WHEN HE SHOULD BE HOME.

15:37.645 --> 15:39.229
CYNTHIA, WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH EDDIE?

15:39.229 --> 15:44.360
HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH
COLON CANCER THREE WEEKS AGO.

15:44.360 --> 15:48.238
AND DR. BROUCHARD TOLD HIM TO
STOP WORK AND START TREATMENT.

15:48.238 --> 15:49.657
SO, EDDIE CAN BEAT THIS?

15:49.657 --> 15:52.868
MAYBE.
BUT ONLY IF HE STARTS NOW.

15:52.868 --> 15:54.703
[ SIGHS ]

15:54.703 --> 15:56.789
EITHER HE'S STICKING HIS HEAD
IN THE SAND,

15:56.789 --> 15:58.290
OR HE WANTS TO KEEP BUSY.

15:58.290 --> 15:59.625
HE WON'T LISTEN TO ANYBODY,

15:59.625 --> 16:01.919
AND HE DOESN'T WANT
ANYONE TO KNOW.

16:01.919 --> 16:06.548
WILL YOU TALK TO HIM WITHOUT
LETTING HIM KNOW I TOLD YOU?

16:06.548 --> 16:08.175
PLEASE?

16:08.175 --> 16:12.012
LOOK, UH...
I GOTTA GO.

16:12.012 --> 16:13.847
I'M WAY BEHIND HERE.

16:13.847 --> 16:15.057
I'M SORRY I --

16:15.057 --> 16:16.350

16:16.350 --> 16:18.978

BUT I -- I GOTTA GO NOW.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.521

OKAY, THANKS.

16:32.324 --> 16:34.326
COP ON THE SWITCHBOARD

16:34.326 --> 16:36.704
GOT ANOTHER CALL
ABOUT THE WILLIAMS BABY.

16:36.704 --> 16:38.205
YEAH, IT CAME FROM
A TONYA DUNBAR.

16:38.205 --> 16:40.833
SHE CALLED FROM HER WORK --
A STATIONERY STORE ON 18th.

16:40.833 --> 16:43.210
YOU TAKE CARE OF THIS,
I'LL HANDLE THE NEWS CONFERENCE.

16:43.210 --> 16:44.336
YOU DONE WITH YOUR INTERVIEWS?

16:44.336 --> 16:45.921
I'M DONE WITH MY LIST.

16:45.921 --> 16:48.340
THERE'S A COUPLE GALS IN
JANITORIAL I DIDN'T GET --

16:48.340 --> 16:50.551
FINISH YOUR INTERVIEWS.

16:50.551 --> 16:53.137
I CAN GET A SECTOR CAR
TO PICK THIS TONYA UP.

16:53.137 --> 16:54.930
YEAH. GOOD.

16:54.930 --> 16:56.056
NO BABY YET?

16:56.056 --> 16:57.766
NO.

16:57.766 --> 16:59.059
HEY.

16:59.059 --> 17:00.519
WHO'S THIS?

17:00.519 --> 17:02.021
THAT'S THE FAMILY
WHOSE CASE WE'RE WORKING.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.647
YOU PAT THEM DOWN
FOR BOX CUTTERS?

17:03.647 --> 17:04.898
COME ON.

17:04.898 --> 17:07.401
YOU FIGURE THEY'D GIVE THEM
THEIR OWN HOSPITAL.

17:07.401 --> 17:09.111
AND WHAT, THEIR OWN DRINKING
FOUNTAINS, TOO?

17:12.906 --> 17:16.493
ALL RIGHT,
I WITHDRAW THE COMMENT.

17:16.493 --> 17:18.954
IS IT ME, OR DID IT JUST GET
A LITTLE HOT IN HERE?

17:18.954 --> 17:21.123
YOUR INTERVIEWS.
I GOT IT.

17:21.123 --> 17:22.666
COME ON.

17:29.923 --> 17:31.383
YOU'RE THE DETECTIVES
INVESTIGATING THE FIRE?

17:31.383 --> 17:33.010
DETECTIVE JONES AND MEDAVOY.

17:33.010 --> 17:36.055
I'M SOLOMON.
YOU SPOKE TO MY DAD AND UNCLE
EARLIER.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.347
WERE YOU UPSTAIRS
WHEN THE FIRE HIT?

17:37.347 --> 17:39.892
I GO TO ST. JOHN'S.
I CAME AS SOON AS I HEARD.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.226
WAS IT YOUR SISTER
GOT HURT?

17:41.226 --> 17:42.311
MY COUSIN.

17:42.311 --> 17:43.896
HOW'S SHE DOING?

17:43.896 --> 17:45.022
SHE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

17:45.022 --> 17:46.231
GLAD TO HEAR THAT.

17:46.231 --> 17:48.108
DID YOU FIND CHRIS PADGETT?

17:48.108 --> 17:50.652
HE DOESN'T LOOK GOOD FOR IT.

17:50.652 --> 17:52.571
HE'S BEEN GIVING MY FAMILY
PROBLEMS.

17:52.571 --> 17:54.073
HE WAS AT WORK.
WE VERIFIED THAT.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.115
OKAY.

17:55.115 --> 17:56.408
WHAT WE'D LIKE TO GET IS

17:56.408 --> 17:58.535
ANYBODY ELSE YOUR FAMILY
HAD PROBLEMS WITH.

17:58.535 --> 18:00.120
PADGETT DID THIS!

18:00.120 --> 18:01.955
SIR, WE LOOKED INTO IT.
DID YOU?

18:01.955 --> 18:03.749
<i>YES. </i>WE DID.

18:03.749 --> 18:06.376
YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO FIND
WHO DID THIS.

18:06.376 --> 18:08.420
THEY DON'T CARE
BECAUSE OF SEPTEMBER 11th!

18:08.420 --> 18:10.923
HEY! WE LOST A LOT OF PEOPLE
THAT DAY.

18:10.923 --> 18:13.342
AND THE FIREMEN WHO PUT
YOUR FIRE OUT THIS MORNING?

18:13.342 --> 18:15.260
THEY LOST EVEN MORE!

18:15.260 --> 18:17.346
SO, YOU DO
BLAME THAT ON US?!

18:17.346 --> 18:20.682
I'M TELLING YOU -- IN SPITE OF
THAT, WE'RE DOING OUR JOB!

18:20.682 --> 18:21.850
HEY, COME ON.

18:21.850 --> 18:23.477
I DON'T LIKE HIM ACCUSING US
OF DIFFERENT!

18:26.063 --> 18:28.524
IF YOU CAN GET A LIST
FROM YOUR DAD AND UNCLE --

18:28.524 --> 18:29.691
OTHER GUYS THEY MAYBE HAD
PROBLEMS WITH --

18:29.691 --> 18:31.193
THAT'D BE A BIG HELP.

18:31.193 --> 18:33.320
THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO.
THANKS.

18:34.780 --> 18:35.864
COME ON.

18:35.864 --> 18:37.074
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

18:46.083 --> 18:47.334
MAY I HELP YOU?

18:47.334 --> 18:51.046
YEAH. THERE WAS A FIRE OVER AT
GREENWICH TV THIS MORNING?

18:51.672 --> 18:52.881
YEAH.

18:52.881 --> 18:54.383
YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION
ON THAT?

18:54.383 --> 18:56.677
YEAH, BUT I WANNA BE SURE
THIS GETS TO PEOPLE

18:56.677 --> 18:58.387
WHO CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

18:58.387 --> 19:00.472
DETECTIVE MEDAVOY,
JONES.

19:00.472 --> 19:01.932
YOU ARE?

19:01.932 --> 19:04.601
JANE DOE.
WHERE ARE WE DOING THIS?

19:12.151 --> 19:14.736
I'M DOING
THE RIGHT THING HERE.

19:14.736 --> 19:16.989
WHATEVER WE TALK ABOUT
STAYS IN THE ROOM.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.158
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY
A REQUIREMENT.

19:20.909 --> 19:22.536
ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT'S
ON YOUR MIND?

19:22.536 --> 19:25.789
THE AL BURMIS -- THEY'RE
THE OWNERS OF GREENWICH TV.

19:25.789 --> 19:28.125
THEY'VE BEEN IN THIS
NEIGHBORHOOD FOR 10 YEARS.

19:28.125 --> 19:29.334
THEY'RE NICE PEOPLE.

19:29.334 --> 19:31.086
WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM
WAS WRONG.

19:31.086 --> 19:32.462
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

19:32.462 --> 19:34.798
AND THE GUY WHO DID IT,
HE'S AN ASSHOLE --

19:34.798 --> 19:37.801
AN ASSHOLE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR
AN EXCUSE TO BE AN ASSHOLE.

19:37.801 --> 19:39.052
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

19:39.052 --> 19:41.471
REMEMBER, NOW --
I LIVE IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD.

19:41.471 --> 19:44.016
THIS CONVERSATION'S
CONFIDENTIAL.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.851
YOU HAVE OUR WORD.

19:45.851 --> 19:47.269
MIKE BIGELOW.

19:47.269 --> 19:51.190
1453 8th STREET,
3rd FLOOR -- IN THE BACK.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.649
HOW DO YOU KNOW HE DID IT?

19:52.649 --> 19:53.942
WE SHARE A WALL.

19:53.942 --> 19:57.321
MY BEDROOM WINDOW IS
RIGHT NEXT TO HIS. I HEARD HIM.

19:57.321 --> 20:00.657
HE WAS BRAGGING ABOUT IT ON THE
PHONE TO ONE OF HIS BUDDIES.

20:00.657 --> 20:03.285
DID HE MENTION A NAME,

30:54.811 --> 30:58.147
MIKE, YOU DIDN'T TELL US
YOU HAD RUN-INS WITH THE OWNERS.

30:58.147 --> 30:59.607
WHAT DO YOU MEAN RUN-INS?

30:59.607 --> 31:02.819
YOU HAD VERBAL CONFRONTATIONS
WITHIN THE PAST MONTHS.

31:02.819 --> 31:05.446
WE RAN YOUR NAME AND PHOTO
PAST THE OWNERS,

31:05.446 --> 31:06.823
AND THEY CONFIRMED IT.

31:06.823 --> 31:08.491
WHAT?!

31:08.491 --> 31:10.827
I ASKED HOW THE FLIGHT-TRAINING
COURSES WERE GOING.

31:10.827 --> 31:12.912
MAYBE I TOLD THEM TO GO BACK

31:12.912 --> 31:14.956
TO WHEREVER THE HELL
THEY CAME FROM.

31:14.956 --> 31:17.959
THEY WEREN'T CONFRONTATIONS.
YOU WANT TO SEE CONFRONTATION?!

31:17.959 --> 31:19.544
THE PROBLEM IS, MIKE,

31:19.544 --> 31:21.421
IT ESTABLISHES YOU HAD
A PREEXISTING BEEF

31:21.421 --> 31:22.714
WITH THESE PEOPLE.

31:22.714 --> 31:25.675
SO YOU SAYING IT WAS RANDOM,
THAT DOESN'T JIVE.

31:25.675 --> 31:28.094
WE TRIED TO HELP YOU OUT
EARLIER,

31:29.304 --> 31:31.890
BUT NOW WE GOT TO GO
WITH THE TRUTH.

31:31.890 --> 31:33.099
YOU KNEW
WHAT YOU WERE DOING

31:33.099 --> 31:34.893
AND WHO YOU WERE
DOING IT TO

31:34.893 --> 31:37.020
WHEN YOU STARTED
THAT FIRE.

31:37.020 --> 31:39.689
DID I GET SCREWED HERE?
DID YOU GUYS SCREW ME?

31:39.689 --> 31:41.190
WE DIDN'T KNOW THE OWNERS
WOULD I.D. YOU.

31:41.190 --> 31:42.650
YOU DIDN'T ASK!

31:43.818 --> 31:45.486
WELL, HERE WE ARE, MIKE.

31:45.486 --> 31:47.822
WE GOT TO AMEND
YOUR STATEMENT.

31:49.032 --> 31:50.950
YOU SCREWED ME.

31:50.950 --> 31:53.912
DID WE PUT THE MOLOTOV COCKTAIL
IN YOUR HAND?

31:53.912 --> 31:56.247
DID WE LIGHT IT?

31:56.247 --> 31:58.917
YOU GOT A MAJOR FLAW,
MIKE.

31:58.917 --> 32:01.085
YOU BLAME PEOPLE FOR THINGS
THEY DIDN'T DO.

32:01.085 --> 32:03.087
THAT'S WHAT GOT YOU
INTO THIS.

32:03.087 --> 32:04.839
<i>YOU </i>SCREWED YOU.

32:17.143 --> 32:18.853
THERE THEY ARE.

32:18.853 --> 32:21.105
YOU'VE MET DETECTIVE CLARK.
THIS IS DETECTIVE SIPOWICZ.

32:21.105 --> 32:22.565
THEY HELPED, TOO.

32:22.565 --> 32:25.693
I CANNOT THANK YOU ENOUGH
FOR BRINGING HER BACK TO ME.

32:25.693 --> 32:28.154
YOU FOUND HER
IN AN ABANDONED BUILDING, HUH?

32:28.154 --> 32:30.448
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ANYMORE.

32:30.448 --> 32:33.576
GUESS WHAT THEY'RE GONNA
NAME HER -- CONNIE.

32:33.576 --> 32:36.287
I'M STILL TRYING TO TALK THEM
OUT OF IT.

32:36.287 --> 32:38.581
I ALWAYS TELL PEOPLE
THE REAL HEROES

32:38.581 --> 32:41.292
ARE THE COPS
AND THE FIREMEN.

32:41.292 --> 32:44.796
YOU GUYS ARE HEROES
IN MY EYES.

32:44.796 --> 32:46.047
GLAD WE COULD HELP.

32:48.341 --> 32:51.177
CAN I GET A PICTURE
OF ALL OF YOU TOGETHER?

32:51.177 --> 32:53.805
I WANT TO REMEMBER THIS MOMENT
FOREVER.

32:53.805 --> 32:55.640
WE GOT TO TALK TO YOU
FIRST.

32:58.267 --> 32:59.644
ABOUT WHAT?

33:01.521 --> 33:03.189
REAL QUICK.

33:12.407 --> 33:15.994
SO, WHAT'S GOING ON?

33:15.994 --> 33:18.538
NICOLE GAVE YOU UP.
NICOLE WHO?

33:18.538 --> 33:20.456
I OUGHT TO SMACK YOU
IN YOUR FACE.

33:20.456 --> 33:22.542
NICOLE, YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

33:22.542 --> 33:26.254
WAS SHE BEHIND THIS?
DID SHE STEAL MY BABY?

33:26.254 --> 33:28.798
FIVE KIDS.
DIDN'T WANT HALF A DOZEN.

33:28.798 --> 33:30.591
SUE THE HOSPITAL.

33:30.591 --> 33:34.095
I SAID THAT AS A JOKE,

33:34.095 --> 33:36.848
YOU KNOW, LIKE YOU SAY TO
SOMEONE YOU WANT TO KILL THEM.

33:36.848 --> 33:38.182
THOSE WERE EXAGGERATIONS.

33:38.182 --> 33:40.435
NO WAY DID I THINK
SHE'D TAKE ME SERIOUS.

33:40.435 --> 33:43.229
WE'LL GIVE YOU 30 SECONDS
TO SAY GOODBYE TO YOUR WIFE.

33:43.229 --> 33:44.397
YOU DON'T DO ME ANY FAVORS,
HUH?

33:44.397 --> 33:46.190
ALL RIGHT, TURN AROUND.

33:46.190 --> 33:50.570
HEY, DO YOU WANT TO HUMILIATE
YOUR WIFE MORE THAN YOU HAVE,

33:50.570 --> 33:54.198
'CAUSE I'LL DRAG YOU OUT OF HERE
BY YOUR HAIR. TURN AROUND.

33:54.198 --> 33:56.200
WHY DON'T YOU KISS MY ASS?!

34:02.331 --> 34:03.666
I GOT HIM.

34:07.128 --> 34:09.047
I GUESS
YOU GOTTA TELL HER.

34:22.769 --> 34:25.772
THE VICTIMS HAD I.D.'d HIM AS
A GUY THEY HAD PROBLEMS WITH.

34:25.772 --> 34:28.149
WE LET HIM SAY
IT WAS RANDOM,

34:28.149 --> 34:30.026
THAT IT WASN'T ABOUT THEM
BEING ARABS.

34:30.026 --> 34:31.486
THAT'S
THE FIRST STATEMENT.

34:31.486 --> 34:33.946
WE WENT BACK AND USED THE I.D.
AGAINST HIM.

34:33.946 --> 34:35.740
THAT'S
THE AMENDED STATEMENT.

34:35.740 --> 34:37.200
LOOKS GOOD.

34:37.200 --> 34:39.285
OCCUPIED DWELLING --
THAT'S ARSON ONE, RIGHT?

34:39.285 --> 34:41.162
BY MEANS
OF INCENDIARY DEVICE.

34:41.162 --> 34:42.663
MINIMUM, 15 TO LIFE.

34:42.663 --> 34:45.458
DO YOU WANT TO GO
FOR THE HATE CRIME?

34:45.458 --> 34:46.876
THAT'S WHAT IT WAS.

34:46.876 --> 34:49.337
THAT'LL PUSH THE MINIMUM
TO 25.

34:49.337 --> 34:50.546
WHICH HE'LL DO.

34:50.546 --> 34:51.798
EVERY DAY OF IT.

34:51.798 --> 34:53.007
ALL RIGHT.

34:55.551 --> 34:58.346
I'M GONNA NEED YOU LATER.

34:58.346 --> 34:59.806
I'LL BE THERE.

35:07.063 --> 35:09.941
WELL, WELL, WELL.

35:11.859 --> 35:13.569
HEY, HOW'S IT GOING?

35:13.569 --> 35:15.238
HEY.

35:15.238 --> 35:18.157
WE GOT MIKE BIGELOW IN CUSTODY,
AND HE'S MADE A STATEMENT.

35:18.157 --> 35:21.077
THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP.
THIS WILL BE A BIG RELIEF.

35:21.077 --> 35:24.872
WE'RE JUST AS HAPPY AS
YOU ARE TO CATCH THIS FOOL.

35:24.872 --> 35:26.457
UM...

35:26.457 --> 35:29.877
I APOLOGIZE FOR WHAT MY UNCLE
SAID AT THE HOSPITAL.

35:29.877 --> 35:32.088
IT WAS WRONG FOR HIM
TO ACCUSE YOU OF NOT CARING.

35:32.088 --> 35:34.298
THAT'S NOT
HOW HE REALLY FEELS,

35:34.298 --> 35:36.425
BECAUSE ALL OF US
APPRECIATE

35:36.425 --> 35:39.637
WHAT THIS DEPARTMENT WENT
THROUGH -- IS GOING THROUGH.

35:39.637 --> 35:42.473
WELL, SOME THINGS CAME
OUT OF MY MOUTH

35:42.473 --> 35:45.476
THAT I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT
EITHER.

35:46.936 --> 35:50.606
WE'LL COME GET STATEMENTS
FROM YOUR FAMILY TOMORROW.

35:50.606 --> 35:52.400
IN THE MEANTIME,
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS,

35:52.400 --> 35:54.026
JUST CALL.

35:54.026 --> 35:56.154
WHAT CAN WE DO?

35:56.154 --> 35:59.198
'CAUSE MY FAMILY'S LIVED HERE
FOR 30 YEARS.

35:59.198 --> 36:01.284
I WAS BORN HERE.

36:01.284 --> 36:03.286
WE'RE AMERICANS.

36:03.286 --> 36:06.998
THERE WERE TIMES IN THIS COUNTRY
IT WASN'T A BIG PLUS

36:06.998 --> 36:10.877
TO BE JAPANESE...OR GERMAN.

36:10.877 --> 36:12.128
OR BLACK.

36:12.128 --> 36:15.464
IT'LL PASS.

36:15.464 --> 36:17.175
HANG IN THERE.

36:23.931 --> 36:26.267
ON THAT NOTE,
GOOD NIGHT.

36:37.612 --> 36:39.071
HOW'S GIBSON DOING?

36:39.071 --> 36:41.657
IS HE BRINGING ANYTHING
TO THE TABLE?

36:44.076 --> 36:45.995
UH --

36:54.629 --> 36:55.963
THE DAD WAS IN ON IT,
HUH?

36:55.963 --> 36:57.215
YEAH.

36:57.215 --> 36:59.467
I GOT A BAD HIT OFF HIM
FROM THE GET-GO.

36:59.467 --> 37:01.427
YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE

37:01.427 --> 37:04.096
WHEN CONNIE
BROUGHT THE BABY BACK,

37:04.096 --> 37:05.556
PUT HER IN HER MA'S ARMS.

37:05.556 --> 37:10.436
NOT A DRY EYE IN THE ROOM.

37:10.436 --> 37:11.896
WHAT?

37:11.896 --> 37:15.483
I'M JUST STILL TRYING TO FIGURE
OUT WHY YOU LEFT NIGHT WATCH.

37:15.483 --> 37:16.859
TRYING TO BEEF UP
MY PENSION.

37:16.859 --> 37:19.487
YOU GOT PLENTY OF MONEY COMING
WITH 28 YEARS.

37:19.487 --> 37:21.030
MAYBE I MIGHT WANT MORE.

37:21.030 --> 37:24.075
WHY PUT UP WITH THE HEADACHES
IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO?

37:24.075 --> 37:25.493
THERE'S NO HEADACHES.

37:25.493 --> 37:28.496
I STILL GOT A LOT TO OFFER
DESPITE WHAT YOU THINK.

37:28.496 --> 37:30.539
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

37:30.539 --> 37:33.542
I MEAN, YOU COME IN LATE.
YOU SEEM A HALF STEP BACK.

37:33.542 --> 37:35.962
YOUR HEART DON'T SEEM IN IT.

37:35.962 --> 37:38.005
I KNOW YOU WELL ENOUGH,

37:38.005 --> 37:40.549
AND SOMETHING'S UP.

37:40.549 --> 37:42.802
WHAT'S GOING ON, EDDIE?

37:45.805 --> 37:48.808
YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH ME
WORKING HERE, ANDY?

37:48.808 --> 37:51.227
YOU TRYING
TO GET ME 86'd?
NO.

37:51.227 --> 37:52.603
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

37:52.603 --> 37:55.690
LET ME DO MY JOB,
AND I'LL LET YOU DO YOURS.

38:01.862 --> 38:04.740
[ SIGHS ]

38:09.245 --> 38:11.497
I HAVEN'T BEEN WORKING
WITH HIM,

38:11.497 --> 38:13.791
SO HE HASN'T HAD A CHANCE
TO ANNOY ME MUCH YET.

38:13.791 --> 38:17.461
SAME WITH ME, BUT I CAN SEE HOW
HE'S BRINGING CONNIE DOWN.

38:17.461 --> 38:19.880
I'M NOT SAYING HE ISN'T
A DECENT ENOUGH GUY.

38:19.880 --> 38:21.340
GREG.

38:21.340 --> 38:24.510
THE THING YOU GOT
TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT EDDIE

38:24.510 --> 38:26.637
IS HE'S BEEN ON NIGHT WATCH
SO LONG

38:26.637 --> 38:28.764
HIS DETECTIVE MUSCLES
ARE ATROPHIED.

38:28.764 --> 38:30.224
HE'S USED TO --

38:30.224 --> 38:32.977
YOU WANT HIM IN OR OUT,
GREG?

38:33.352 --> 38:34.937
IT'S NOT WORKING.

38:34.937 --> 38:36.230
YOU CAN TELL.

38:36.230 --> 38:38.566
ANDY, I'M GONNA CALL
THE BOROUGH COMMANDER

38:38.566 --> 38:41.485
AND ASK TO HAVE GIBSON
TRANSFERRED BACK TO NIGHT WATCH.

38:41.485 --> 38:42.945
I'LL PARTNER UP WITH HIM.

38:42.945 --> 38:44.739
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

38:44.739 --> 38:46.157
I KNOW HOW TO HANDLE HIM.

38:46.157 --> 38:48.200
YOU DON'T THINK
HIS BEING HERE'S DISRUPTIVE?

38:48.200 --> 38:50.536
YEAH, WELL,
I GOT MY DAYS, TOO.

38:50.536 --> 38:52.872
YOU CAN PARTNER CONNIE
AND JUNIOR FOR NOW.

38:52.872 --> 38:54.915
IF YOU CAN CARRY HIM,
THAT'S FINE.

38:54.915 --> 38:58.002
BUT IF HE STARTS TO BRING YOUR
WORK DOWN, I'M BOUNCING HIM.

39:02.089 --> 39:04.425
THIS AIN'T GOT NOTHING TO DO
WITH ME AND YOU.

39:04.425 --> 39:06.177
DON'T WORRY.
I GOT IT.

39:06.177 --> 39:07.428
I, UH --

39:07.428 --> 39:10.806
I'M SORRY IF IT LOOKS LIKE
I PUSHED HIM OFF ON YOU.

39:10.806 --> 39:11.932
YOU DIDN'T.

39:11.932 --> 39:13.601
GOOD NIGHT.

39:13.601 --> 39:14.643
GOOD NIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT.

39:14.643 --> 39:17.063
LOOK,
I KNOW TODAY YOU DEALT

39:17.063 --> 39:19.523
WITH A LOT
OF MOTHER-DAUGHTER STUFF.

39:19.523 --> 39:20.858
I'M FINE.

39:20.858 --> 39:23.611
I'M JUST MAKING SURE
YOU'RE NOT THINKING MORE

39:23.611 --> 39:25.196
ABOUT REACHING OUT TO HER,

39:25.196 --> 39:27.114
WHICH IS NOT A GOOD IDEA.

39:27.114 --> 39:30.409
YEAH, I KNOW.

39:30.409 --> 39:33.662
IF YOU WANT, COME OVER FOR
DINNER TONIGHT WITH ME AND THEO.

39:33.662 --> 39:35.206
ORDER A PIZZA OR SOMETHING.

39:35.206 --> 39:38.709
THANKS, BUT ACTUALLY,
I-I GOT A DATE.

39:40.544 --> 39:42.505
IS THIS SOMETHING NEW?

39:42.505 --> 39:44.673
YEAH. A FRIEND SET ME UP.

39:44.673 --> 39:46.258
BUT THANKS FOR THE OFFER.

39:46.258 --> 39:47.468
SURE.

39:47.468 --> 39:48.803
GOOD NIGHT, ANDY.

39:48.803 --> 39:49.845
YEAH.

39:53.724 --> 39:55.810
GOOD NIGHT.

39:55.810 --> 39:57.603
YOU AND ME
GOT SOMETHING TO WORK OUT?

39:57.603 --> 39:59.480
'CAUSE I DON'T WANT THIS
CARRYING OVER.

40:01.232 --> 40:02.400
IT WON'T.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.360
WE'RE COOL.

40:12.118 --> 40:14.036
YOU KNOW ANYBODY
WHO CONVERTED?

40:14.036 --> 40:15.121
TO ISLAM?

40:15.121 --> 40:16.330
YEAH.

40:16.330 --> 40:18.249
MY COUSIN IN HOUSTON.

40:18.249 --> 40:21.502
HE CATCH ANY HEAT SINCE
THIS WHOLE THING WENT DOWN?

40:21.502 --> 40:24.839
NOT OFF HIS APPEARANCE.
HE LOOKS LIKE SUGAR RAY LEONARD.

40:24.839 --> 40:27.299
BUT HIS MOSQUE
GOT VANDALIZED --

40:27.299 --> 40:30.302
SOME GRAFFITI,
A ROCK THROUGH A WINDOW.

40:30.302 --> 40:33.264
NOTHING LIKE WHAT HAPPENED
TO THOSE PEOPLE TODAY, THOUGH.

40:33.264 --> 40:36.392
ANDY MADE A COMMENT,
AND I JUMPED DOWN HIS THROAT.

40:36.392 --> 40:37.685
I CAN'T SAY I DIDN'T HAVE
THE SAME THOUGHTS

40:37.685 --> 40:39.353
GOING THROUGH MY HEAD.

40:40.896 --> 40:44.108
HELL, I PLAYED LIKE I WAS
A RACIST TO GET THE GUY,

40:44.108 --> 40:46.902
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE I HAD
TO SEARCH FOR THE WORDS.

40:46.902 --> 40:49.238
YOU'RE NOT RACIST.

40:53.284 --> 40:55.202
YOU'RE HUMAN.

40:55.202 --> 40:57.496
AND THERE'S WHAT GOES
THROUGH YOUR HEAD

40:57.496 --> 40:59.290
AND WHAT SHOWS
IN YOUR ACTIONS.

40:59.290 --> 41:03.294
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE.
THAT'S WHAT MATTERS.

41:03.294 --> 41:05.296
YEAH, WELL...

41:05.296 --> 41:08.007
I DON'T LIKE IT GOING
THROUGH MY HEAD, PERIOD.

41:08.007 --> 41:11.469
IT SURE AS HELL WASN'T THERE
BEFORE SEPTEMBER 11th.

41:14.263 --> 41:15.890
WHEN THE ATTACKS HAPPENED

41:15.890 --> 41:18.142
AND WE WERE ALL REELING

41:19.685 --> 41:21.645
AND YOU WERE WORKING
18-HOUR DAYS,

41:23.189 --> 41:24.440
I LOOK BACK ON THAT,

41:24.440 --> 41:26.609
AND I WISH WE COULD HAVE BEEN
THERE MORE FOR EACH OTHER.

41:29.737 --> 41:31.822
WELL, WE'RE HERE NOW,
RIGHT?

41:32.865 --> 41:34.533
DEFINITELY.

41:48.047 --> 41:51.175
HE THINKS HE'S SO COOL
'CAUSE THESE ROCK STARS STOP BY

41:51.175 --> 41:53.135
AND CALL HIM
BY HIS FIRST NAME.

41:53.135 --> 41:54.970
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
YES, IT IS.

41:54.970 --> 41:58.682
THEN ALL THE HIP-HOP GUYS
COME BY. HE GETS ALL DOWN.

41:58.682 --> 42:01.310
HE GIVES THEM
A LITTLE ONE-ARM HUG

42:01.310 --> 42:02.394
WITH HIS FIST IN THE BACK

42:02.394 --> 42:03.812
LIKE HE'S BORN QUEENS
OR SOMETHING.

42:03.812 --> 42:05.022
HE'S LAME.

42:05.022 --> 42:06.565
HE'S HOT.

42:06.565 --> 42:08.692
