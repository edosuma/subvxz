(Jeremy)
So now, on to the matter
of Peter's wedding.

00:04.138 --> 00:07.041
We can't all take a week off for
the wedding of an ex-employee.

00:07.141 --> 00:08.609
It's unprofessional.

00:08.709 --> 00:11.279
(distorted deep male voice)
Hello. I want to play a game.

00:11.379 --> 00:12.646
You're all gonna die.

00:12.746 --> 00:15.149
And then I'm gonna
kill your families.

00:15.249 --> 00:17.151
- Oh, God, ah! Ah! Ah!
- Oh, God, ah!

00:17.251 --> 00:18.152
(Mindy)
Oh, my God.

00:18.252 --> 00:19.187
- Peter!
- [laughs]

00:19.287 --> 00:21.255
[in Urkel voice]
Did I do that?

00:21.355 --> 00:22.790
Whoo!
It's always so awesome.

00:22.890 --> 00:24.125
Peter, hey.

00:24.225 --> 00:25.126
- I love that.
- Hey.

00:25.226 --> 00:26.494
- Hey.
- Best guy.

00:26.594 --> 00:27.495
- It's good to see you, pal.
- How's it going, man?

00:27.595 --> 00:29.063
Peter,
what are you doing here?

00:29.163 --> 00:30.264
You look awful.

00:31.365 --> 00:32.733
Oh, man, did Lauren call off
the wedding? I knew it.

00:32.833 --> 00:33.734
[gasps]

00:34.535 --> 00:35.636
This is a lesson
for all of us, okay?

00:36.737 --> 00:39.407
Next time, pick someone
in your own league, right?

00:39.507 --> 00:41.742
No, the wedding's going on.
I signed her pre-nup yesterday.

00:41.842 --> 00:43.411
Hey, screw the wedding.

00:43.511 --> 00:45.379
When's the bachelor party?
Okay.

00:45.479 --> 00:46.547
Are we going
white water rafting?

00:46.647 --> 00:48.482
And if so,
if I don't have a swim suit,

00:48.582 --> 00:49.583
can I just wear my underpants?

00:50.518 --> 00:51.585
I kind of had the bachelor party
yesterday.

00:52.653 --> 00:54.188
And the festivities
got a little out of control.

00:54.288 --> 00:55.389
Pube tried to kiss me.

00:55.489 --> 00:56.657
And then begged me
not to get married.

00:56.757 --> 00:58.392
So I'm kind of in the market
for a new best man.

00:58.492 --> 01:00.328
Oh, God!
[clears throat]

01:00.428 --> 01:03.397
Dr. Peter Prentice,
will you give me the honor

01:03.497 --> 01:05.833
of letting me be
your best man?

01:05.933 --> 01:08.502
If I don't have a tuxedo,
can I wear my underpants?

01:08.602 --> 01:09.770
Mindy, will you be
my best man?

01:09.870 --> 01:10.804
Wow!

01:10.904 --> 01:12.273
Peter, I would be honored.

01:12.373 --> 01:13.607
No, a best man
that's a girl?

01:13.707 --> 01:16.410
What's next? Is the maid
of honor gonna be a chair?

01:16.510 --> 01:18.112
Thanks a lot, Ryan Murphy.

01:18.212 --> 01:19.313
(Peter)
It's a big responsibility.

01:19.413 --> 01:20.548
You got to learn
the best man dance.

01:21.615 --> 01:22.716
Pube and I have had some sweaty,
intimate rehearsals.

01:23.817 --> 01:25.319
I feel like you've been
sending Pube mixed messages.

01:25.419 --> 01:26.254
- Mm.
- Mm.

01:26.354 --> 01:28.189
I've only just now
heard of this tradition.

01:28.289 --> 01:30.291
And it's already the most
important one in my life.

01:30.391 --> 01:32.160
Hey, best man.

01:32.260 --> 01:33.594
Maid of honor?

01:33.694 --> 01:36.597
[hip-hop music]

01:36.697 --> 01:38.199
*

01:40.401 --> 01:41.702
- Hey, sweetheart.
- Hey, babe.

01:41.802 --> 01:43.837
Do you remember how I told you
that my parents

01:43.937 --> 01:45.439
are moving to India
for a year?

01:45.539 --> 01:47.208
Yeah, I said,
"I guess even the Third World

01:47.308 --> 01:48.309
is better than Boston."

01:48.409 --> 01:50.178
- Hilarious.
- Yes.

01:50.278 --> 01:53.147
Well, we're actually having
a going away party for them

01:53.247 --> 01:54.448
- in Boston.
- Oh, yeah?

01:54.548 --> 01:56.617
And I thought
you could come with me.

01:56.717 --> 01:58.152
And you could
finally meet them.

01:58.252 --> 02:00.154
Wow, your mom and dad.

02:00.254 --> 02:01.155
That's big.

02:01.255 --> 02:03.491
- Are you nervous?
- No.

02:03.591 --> 02:05.426
Aren't you excited
to meet the parents

02:05.526 --> 02:07.728
of the little girl whose
innocence you stole, you pedo?

02:07.828 --> 02:09.263
Yeah, I am excited.

02:09.363 --> 02:10.831
And, yes, it's a little
nerve-racking.

02:10.931 --> 02:12.766
They are going to love you
just as you are.

02:12.866 --> 02:15.303
- Yeah?
- Yeah. 'Cause you're perfect.

02:15.403 --> 02:17.171
- Thanks, babe.
- Okay. I can't wait.

02:17.271 --> 02:18.706
Oh, and, um,
it might be a good idea

02:18.806 --> 02:20.574
to bring my mom
a nice bottle of wine.

02:20.674 --> 02:21.909
Absolutely.

02:22.009 --> 02:24.578
And you could bring my dad
a cool non-fiction book.

02:24.678 --> 02:25.579
- Sure.
- He loves reading.

02:25.679 --> 02:26.714
Great.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.550
And maybe, like, a rare coin
for Grandfather.

02:29.650 --> 02:30.351
Terrific.

02:30.451 --> 02:31.819
And don't bring up
the Yankees

02:31.919 --> 02:33.854
'cause my dad
is a big Red Sox fan.

02:33.954 --> 02:37.157
Okay. Wine, coin, book,
no Yankees. Got it.

02:37.258 --> 02:39.260
Oh, I have a procedure
Wednesday afternoon,

02:39.360 --> 02:41.395
but I'll just come up
to Boston after--is that okay?

02:41.495 --> 02:43.831
Of course.
I'm so excited, sweetheart.

02:43.931 --> 02:46.834
By the way, I love this new
scruff that you're rocking.

02:46.934 --> 02:48.336
- Oh, yeah?
- Very sexy.

02:48.436 --> 02:49.770
Thank you.
I'm just trying something new.

02:49.870 --> 02:51.705
But when you meet my parents,
you should shave it off,

02:51.805 --> 02:53.674
'cause they will hate it.

02:53.774 --> 02:55.175
Bye.
I love you.

(Morgan)
Women can't dance
and they're not funny.

03:08.956 --> 03:10.358
I should be Dr. P's best man!

03:10.458 --> 03:11.625
(Peter)
Hey.

03:11.725 --> 03:13.827
I haven't gotten your RSVP
for the wedding.

03:13.927 --> 03:15.195
Yeah, I can't make it, buddy.

03:15.296 --> 03:16.196
I'm so sorry.

03:16.297 --> 03:17.798
I've got a lot going on at work.

03:17.898 --> 03:20.434
And I have these new succulents
that are having real trouble

03:20.534 --> 03:21.435
adjusting to their pots.

03:21.535 --> 03:23.504
So I'm just totally busy.

03:23.604 --> 03:24.405
You're not that busy.

03:24.505 --> 03:25.839
You're taking
a gift-wrapping class.

03:25.939 --> 03:27.575
- [sighs]
- Hey, are we cool?

03:27.675 --> 03:29.243
You know what?
We're actually not.

03:29.343 --> 03:30.411
I'm still bumming out
about the best man thing,

03:30.511 --> 03:31.545
to be honest.

03:31.645 --> 03:32.913
Not you.
Never you.

03:33.013 --> 03:34.515
I know things ended weird
between you and I

03:34.615 --> 03:35.516
with the whole Lauren thing,

03:36.350 --> 03:36.384
but it would really mean
a lot to me

03:37.050 --> 03:37.518
if you came to the wedding.

03:37.985 --> 03:38.686
Peter, we're cool.

03:38.786 --> 03:39.987
You know, I'm swamped.

03:41.088 --> 03:41.922
I wish there was more to it,
but, you know, that's it.

03:42.490 --> 03:43.324
- That's it.
- Yup.

03:43.891 --> 03:46.694
- Okay.
- All right.

03:46.794 --> 03:49.330
Hey, man, as a person
who just received

03:49.430 --> 03:52.433
his first invitation
to an event,

03:52.533 --> 03:54.435
I think you're making
a big mistake.

04:15.323 --> 04:16.724
(Mindy on phone)
Hey, babe.
Are you at South Station?

04:16.824 --> 04:17.991
I'll come and get you.

04:19.126 --> 04:20.661
Okay. Whatever you do,
do not talk to any white people.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.463
In Boston,
they're the dangerous ones.

04:22.563 --> 04:23.997
I'm still here at the hospital.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.500
The procedure went late
and I missed my train.

04:26.600 --> 04:27.401
(Mindy)
Just take a later train.

04:27.501 --> 04:29.537
We can spend the morning
with my parents.

04:29.637 --> 04:30.904
My dad can get us into
Fenway Park.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.340
You can spit right on the field.

04:32.440 --> 04:34.975
I got to get home, and pack,
and shave.

04:35.075 --> 04:36.444
I'll be up late anyway.

04:37.645 --> 04:37.911
Some of the cousins are gonna
watch Happy Gilmore.

04:38.812 --> 04:39.847
Well, I guess I could catch
a flight.

04:40.681 --> 04:41.482
But by the time
I get to La Guardia,

04:42.683 --> 04:45.719
buy a ticket--they always
pull me at the security line.

04:45.819 --> 04:47.655
I don't know.
Is this--

04:47.755 --> 04:49.523
Does really make sense
for tonight, babe?

04:49.623 --> 04:51.459
[family laughing
inside restaurant]

04:54.462 --> 04:55.996
You should stay in
and get some sleep.

04:56.096 --> 04:57.998
(Danny)
Give my regards to your folks,
okay?

04:58.098 --> 05:01.001
Tell them I said hi.

05:01.101 --> 05:02.636
- Love you.
- Love you.

(Mindy)
Ooh, what's he saying now?

05:11.445 --> 05:13.414
(Peter)
He's doing
a Schwarzenegger impression,

05:13.514 --> 05:15.048
and it is really funny.

05:15.148 --> 05:16.884
- Really?
- Yeah.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.419
How's your blood pressure?

05:18.519 --> 05:19.887
Did you go see that new doctor
I recommended?

05:21.154 --> 05:22.155
I don't understand why you can't
keep being my doctor in Texas.

05:22.255 --> 05:25.325
Because I can't deliver
your baby over Skype, Mindy.

05:25.426 --> 05:26.760
Now promise me
you'll go see the doctor.

05:26.860 --> 05:27.995
- Fine.
- Thank you.

05:29.062 --> 05:30.464
But I will not have my crotch
do voices for her.

05:30.564 --> 05:31.965
That's for you.

05:32.065 --> 05:33.333
Thank you.

05:33.434 --> 05:34.868
Hey, babe.

05:34.968 --> 05:36.370
- Oh, what's up, Pete?
- Hey, man.

05:36.470 --> 05:37.438
Could I talk to you for a sec?

05:37.538 --> 05:39.473
Sure.

05:39.573 --> 05:41.108
Sorry about the party
last night.

05:41.208 --> 05:42.075
- Mm-hmm.
- But I'll tell you this much,

05:42.175 --> 05:44.778
I got a lot of sleep,
so I'm a new Dan.

05:44.878 --> 05:46.480
- That's good.
- I was thinking,

05:46.580 --> 05:48.348
when your folks get back,
the baby will be here,

05:48.449 --> 05:51.885
our home will be ready,
that I could meet them then.

05:51.985 --> 05:53.120
Mm-hmm.
That sounds good.

05:53.220 --> 05:53.987
Can I get their address?

05:54.087 --> 05:55.389
I want to send them
some flowers.

05:55.489 --> 05:56.624
No, no, no.
Don't. Please.

05:56.724 --> 05:59.460
Flowers are a symbol of death
in India.

05:59.560 --> 06:00.761
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.129
Okay, well, that's definitely
not the message

06:02.229 --> 06:03.464
I want to give them.

06:04.432 --> 06:04.465
What about candy, or fruit,
or something?

06:05.032 --> 06:05.733
All symbols of death.

06:06.600 --> 06:06.934
It's okay,
because I talked to them,

06:08.001 --> 06:09.002
and I explained to them
that you were very tired,

06:10.170 --> 06:12.139
and that white men get more
tired than men of other races,

06:12.239 --> 06:14.374
and they totally understood it,
and they're fine.

06:14.475 --> 06:15.776
That's great
'cause Sicilian men

06:15.876 --> 06:17.645
need ten hours
of sleep anyways.

06:17.745 --> 06:19.012
They sound like nice people.

06:19.112 --> 06:20.414
- I love you.
- Love you.

06:20.514 --> 06:23.884
- Later, Pete.
- Hey, take it easy.

06:25.653 --> 06:27.455
So what's that lie about now?

06:27.555 --> 06:28.622
- Hmm?
- Oh, my God.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.958
Do you not have parents?

06:31.058 --> 06:32.760
Were you raised like Mowgli
from The Jungle Book?

06:32.860 --> 06:34.027
I think I've seen you
eat bugs.

06:34.127 --> 06:36.964
That was one time,
and of course I have parents.

06:37.064 --> 06:39.733
Just, I don't want Danny
to contact them

06:39.833 --> 06:43.003
because my parents don't know
that Danny exists.

06:46.173 --> 06:47.407
They know he exists, Peter.

06:47.508 --> 06:49.176
- Uh-huh.
- As my co-worker.

06:49.276 --> 06:52.012
Just not as my boyfriend
or the father of my baby.

06:52.112 --> 06:53.146
Oh, my God.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.448
Do they know about me?

06:54.548 --> 06:55.516
Do they think I'm cool?

06:55.616 --> 06:56.817
You know what?
That's not important right now.

06:57.751 --> 06:57.785
What were you gonna do
when Danny showed up

06:58.385 --> 06:58.852
to your parents' party?

06:59.753 --> 06:59.787
Well, that was
when I was gonna come clean

07:00.253 --> 07:00.888
and introduce him.

07:01.522 --> 07:01.889
Why would you lie like that?

07:02.590 --> 07:03.457
When I found out I was pregnant,

07:04.692 --> 07:05.726
I wasn't even sure that Danny
and I were gonna stay together.

07:06.494 --> 07:06.760
Eight months ago,
he had a problem

07:07.661 --> 07:08.195
with me leaving a toothbrush
at his place.

07:08.829 --> 07:09.763
Yeah, but now he's all-in.

07:10.898 --> 07:11.665
He's even practicing jogging
while pushing a stroller.

07:12.232 --> 07:12.766
I thought he was all-in.

07:13.701 --> 07:15.636
But then, I invited him
to come up to Boston

07:15.736 --> 07:18.472
to meet my parents,
before they leave for a year,

07:18.572 --> 07:20.040
and he bailed on that.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.141
[sighs]

07:22.042 --> 07:22.976
And I would end
my best man speech with,

07:24.011 --> 07:26.647
"Lauren, Peter,
together, you can do anything.

07:26.747 --> 07:30.484
Even walk on the moon."

07:30.584 --> 07:31.485
Oh!

07:35.288 --> 07:37.124
I don't think
you're gonna get to be best man

07:37.224 --> 07:38.191
through talent, Morgan.

07:39.059 --> 07:39.893
- Mm.
- So why don't you win him over

07:40.928 --> 07:41.795
the same way you got me
to go on a date with you?

07:42.563 --> 07:45.465
Cry like a baby
until he says yes.

07:45.566 --> 07:46.934
Yes.
Yes.

07:47.034 --> 07:48.536
(Peter)
You've done a lot
of immoral stuff,

07:48.636 --> 07:49.837
but this is the worst.

07:49.937 --> 07:50.971
(Mindy)
Shh! Keep your voice down.

07:51.071 --> 07:52.072
I don't want Danny to hear.

07:52.172 --> 07:55.609
If it wasn't Danny
who got you pregnant, who did?

07:55.709 --> 07:57.044
(Mindy)
Just some guy I dated.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.646
And he's not in the picture
anymore.

07:58.746 --> 07:59.880
Danny is gonna freak out.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.682
I know.
That's why you cannot tell him.

08:01.782 --> 08:02.750
You have to promise me.

08:02.850 --> 08:03.751
Morgan?

08:04.552 --> 08:04.818
- [sighs]
- What were you doing?

08:05.719 --> 08:07.487
Watching my entire world
crumble around me.

08:08.856 --> 08:10.123
Okay.

08:11.291 --> 08:12.993
Mindy, you have to tell him
because this is not cool.

08:14.227 --> 08:15.529
And more importantly, when your
heart is filled with lies,

08:16.730 --> 08:17.230
it makes it difficult for your
feet to be light with dance.

08:17.665 --> 08:18.632
Now, let's go.

08:19.432 --> 08:19.900
We have a best man dance
to learn.

08:21.001 --> 08:21.969
And you need to see that doctor
I told you about.

08:22.069 --> 08:22.970
Okay.

08:23.070 --> 08:24.572
(Trapeznikov)
Hello.

08:24.672 --> 08:27.775
My name is
Dr. Ludmila Trapeznikov.

08:27.875 --> 08:31.078
It is great honor for me
to care for you in pregnancy.

08:31.178 --> 08:33.180
Oh, well, thank you.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.782
Peter speaks very highly
of you.

08:34.882 --> 08:37.551
Peter.
Peter is my favorite Jew.

08:37.651 --> 08:39.687
- He's my favorite Jew as well.
- Yes.

08:39.787 --> 08:43.523
You are high-risk
because of, uh,

08:43.624 --> 08:47.728
how you say, fat,
and much age.

08:47.828 --> 08:49.096
Hey, man,
I know you just moved here

08:49.196 --> 08:50.831
from, like, the Urkraig,
or whatever,

08:50.931 --> 08:53.100
but in this country, when you
call a woman fat and old,

08:53.200 --> 08:54.534
it's considered rude.

08:54.635 --> 08:56.103
I mean not be rude.

08:56.203 --> 08:59.106
Where I come from,
this is compliment.

08:59.206 --> 09:04.311
You not understand,
"fat," like big, happy,

09:04.411 --> 09:06.647
fat, lots of meat.

09:06.747 --> 09:09.750
For the baby,
this mansion you give.

09:09.850 --> 09:11.318
You are pregnant, yes?

09:11.418 --> 09:13.253
I am going to Texas
for a wedding

09:13.353 --> 09:16.624
and I need to know if I can ride
the mechanical bull.

09:16.724 --> 09:18.959
No, no, no, no,
Mindishka.

09:19.059 --> 09:21.028
You have pre-eclampsia.

09:21.128 --> 09:23.631
You no ride nothing.

09:23.731 --> 09:27.735
No bull, no man,
and no flying nowhere

09:27.768 --> 09:27.801
till the babishka
is pushed out.

09:29.670 --> 09:31.571
Is my blood pressure
that high?

09:31.672 --> 09:33.040
Yes.
You see these numbers?

09:33.140 --> 09:36.209
It went around,
tried to go another time, broke.

09:36.309 --> 09:37.310
I don't know how
I'm gonna tell Peter

09:37.410 --> 09:39.246
that I can't be
his best man.

09:39.346 --> 09:42.049
You are a man!

09:42.149 --> 09:44.317
Oh, now this makes
so much more sense.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.053
Yes. Yes.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.657
Hey, Danny,
can we not stay here too long?

09:49.757 --> 09:51.759
There's actually something that
I wanted to talk to you about.

09:51.859 --> 09:53.360
It's gonna take as long as
it's gonna take, okay?

09:53.460 --> 09:55.328
Can you just be quiet
for once in your life?

09:55.428 --> 09:58.198
You know, Cookie from Empire
says, "No man hushes me!"

09:58.298 --> 09:59.800
And I'm like her, okay?

09:59.900 --> 10:02.035
So--

10:02.135 --> 10:03.871
Why is Beverly's chopper here?

10:03.971 --> 10:05.172
That's not Beverly's chopper.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.173
Oh, no.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.776
(all)
Surprise!

10:08.876 --> 10:10.310
Oh, my God!
What's happening?

10:10.410 --> 10:12.746
It's a surprise baby shower,
dum-dum.

10:12.846 --> 10:13.747
Get your head in the game.

10:13.847 --> 10:15.048
[laughter]

10:15.148 --> 10:17.718
A onesie that says "feminist."
I love it.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.853
I thought it would be
empowering for him.

10:19.953 --> 10:20.921
Yeah, no.
I love it

10:21.789 --> 10:22.355
for, like, pajamas
around the house.

10:23.556 --> 10:24.658
I don't think I like that
for him, right now, so let's--

10:25.292 --> 10:26.259
Thank you so much, Tamara.

10:26.359 --> 10:28.929
That's a onesie
from Tamara.

10:29.029 --> 10:30.197
(Mindy)
The gifts have been
so thoughtful,

10:30.297 --> 10:32.132
with the exception
of the edible underwear

10:32.232 --> 10:33.366
that Beverly gave me.

10:34.501 --> 10:35.335
I can only assume she thought
this was a bridal shower.

10:35.969 --> 10:36.670
Just 'cause
you're a mom

10:37.537 --> 10:38.672
doesn't mean
you can't look good, babe.

10:38.772 --> 10:39.673
- Edible--
- Yeah.

10:39.773 --> 10:40.808
You don't have to write that.

10:41.775 --> 10:41.809
I'm not gonna send
a "Thank You" note for that.

10:42.810 --> 10:44.177
I also want to just say
that it's been wonderful

10:44.277 --> 10:46.113
being around
all of my loved ones,

10:46.213 --> 10:49.783
and Annette's walking group,
and her mailwoman, Regina.

10:49.883 --> 10:53.053
Mindy, you know, I tried to
invite your side of the family,

10:53.153 --> 10:55.188
but Danny didn't know
how to get in touch with them.

10:55.288 --> 10:57.958
Annette, don't pry.

10:58.058 --> 10:59.659
Maybe she's from
a broken home.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.328
Guys, come on.
Give Mindy a break.

11:01.428 --> 11:02.930
Her parents are probably
in India somewhere

11:03.030 --> 11:04.798
naming a goat after our son.

11:04.898 --> 11:08.135
Well, why don't we just see

11:08.235 --> 11:10.771
exactly what they're doing
right now?

11:10.871 --> 11:12.672
What do you mean,
"what they're doing right now"?

11:12.773 --> 11:15.308
It's a surprise for Mindy
and her parents!

11:15.408 --> 11:16.844
I talked to your brother, Rishi,

11:16.944 --> 11:19.212
and I got
your parents' email address

11:19.312 --> 11:22.149
so they could join us
in a video chat.

11:22.249 --> 11:23.316
(both)
What?

11:23.416 --> 11:24.451
- Why?
- Oh, no.

11:25.385 --> 11:25.418
- Why'd you do that, Mom?
- You know what?

11:26.119 --> 11:26.954
They're very shy, so--
Oh, God.

11:27.554 --> 11:28.088
- Oh, no, no.
- Okay.

11:28.655 --> 11:29.089
- Okay.
- All right.

11:29.689 --> 11:30.157
(Morgan)
Shut the laptop!

11:30.724 --> 11:31.291
I got something to say.

11:31.792 --> 11:32.425
Guys, Morgan's here.

11:33.060 --> 11:33.961
And he has something to say.

11:34.627 --> 11:35.062
- Thank you.
- Go ahead.

11:35.628 --> 11:37.130
This shower is a lie!

11:37.230 --> 11:39.933
Their relationship is a lie!

11:40.033 --> 11:43.737
The father of that baby
is one of these men behind me.

11:43.837 --> 11:46.073
[hip-hop music]

11:46.173 --> 11:48.742
Yeah, they're all here,
baby.

11:48.842 --> 11:50.010
All these men.

11:50.110 --> 11:52.379
- And one of them is the dad.
- What?

11:55.215 --> 11:56.216
Take them out.

11:57.150 --> 11:57.951
Morgan, what the hell
is going on here?

11:58.518 --> 11:59.219
Who are all these men?

11:59.887 --> 12:00.954
Any why are they all white?

12:01.889 --> 12:03.323
Because I heard this one
tell Dr. Prentice

12:03.423 --> 12:04.758
that you're not
the real father

12:05.793 --> 12:06.326
and it's just some random guy
that she dated.

12:06.994 --> 12:07.494
- [gasps]
- Oh, Morgan.

12:07.995 --> 12:08.962
What have you done?

12:10.130 --> 12:12.265
I used my extensive knowledge
of your sexual history,

12:12.365 --> 12:15.068
and the plot of Mamma Mia,
and several thousand dollars

12:15.168 --> 12:17.337
of my savings to wrangle
the four of your ex-boyfriends

12:17.437 --> 12:19.006
that I find the sexiest

12:19.106 --> 12:21.108
to find out
which one is the father!

12:21.208 --> 12:23.777
That's right!
The gang's all here.

12:23.877 --> 12:25.913
The Manhattan Meat Train.
I give you...

12:26.013 --> 12:28.048
- Josh, Jamie...
- Hey.

12:28.148 --> 12:29.082
- Casey...
- What's up?

12:29.182 --> 12:30.350
- Eric--
- Lee.

12:30.450 --> 12:31.852
- Lee.
- It's Lee.

12:31.952 --> 12:33.486
And you're gonna take this rose,

12:33.586 --> 12:34.822
and you're gonna put it
in the hand

12:34.922 --> 12:36.957
of the man
that knocked you up.

12:37.057 --> 12:37.991
I'm not gonna do that.

12:38.826 --> 12:38.859
Can I get reimbursed
for the flower?

12:39.292 --> 12:40.327
Come on, man.

12:41.394 --> 12:43.230
I'm sorry. Hey, Mindy,
I know it's been a minute

12:43.330 --> 12:44.431
since I've been all up in it.

12:44.531 --> 12:46.099
But I want to be
in my son's life.

12:46.199 --> 12:49.069
I want to provide tight kicks
for his little feet.

12:49.169 --> 12:50.070
No, just stop.
Stop.

12:50.170 --> 12:51.071
Everyone, stop.

12:51.171 --> 12:52.172
None of you guys
are the father.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.240
Danny's the father,
of course.

12:53.340 --> 12:55.075
Yes.
No kidding I'm the father.

12:55.175 --> 12:56.243
Morgan, why would you even
think that?

12:57.277 --> 13:01.081
He thinks that because
my parents don't know that.

13:01.181 --> 13:02.482
What?

13:02.582 --> 13:05.986
My parent's don't know
that you exist.

13:06.086 --> 13:06.987
What are you talking about?

13:07.087 --> 13:09.322
Hey, uh, I'm so sorry.

13:09.422 --> 13:11.925
I'm confused.
So, I'm not the dad?

13:12.025 --> 13:15.162
Okay, good, because
I have a genetic condition

13:15.262 --> 13:17.164
that you guys would--

13:17.264 --> 13:19.132
- You would find chilling.
- No.

13:19.232 --> 13:20.267
Can we go talk about this
in private?

13:20.367 --> 13:22.102
Why don't your parents
know about me?

13:22.202 --> 13:23.971
I was gonna introduce you
at the party,

13:24.071 --> 13:25.305
but then you never came.

13:25.405 --> 13:28.108
Well, I would've come
if I knew I didn't exist.

13:28.208 --> 13:29.276
It shouldn't take that much
for you

13:29.376 --> 13:30.510
to want to come
and meet them.

13:31.644 --> 13:32.279
I met your family because I knew
it was important to you.

13:32.913 --> 13:33.513
I was excited to meet them.

13:34.614 --> 13:35.248
Yeah. I thought you thought
Ma and Dot were cool.

13:36.383 --> 13:37.484
Of course they're not cool,
Danny, look at those vests.

13:37.584 --> 13:39.586
They're reversible.

13:39.686 --> 13:41.121
Inside, there's birds.

13:41.221 --> 13:43.490
Danny, you couldn't meet
my parents once

13:43.590 --> 13:46.927
when they were going away
to India for an entire year.

13:47.027 --> 13:49.997
Do you know how many
of these guys have met my folks?

13:50.097 --> 13:51.999
I went on a walking tour
of Little Italy with them.

13:52.099 --> 13:54.234
Remember every single
second of it

13:54.334 --> 13:55.268
'cause I was high
on crystal.

13:55.368 --> 13:56.403
Is that why you peed yourself?

13:56.503 --> 13:58.505
- That is why I peed myself.
- Great.

13:58.605 --> 14:00.607
Amantes sunt amentes.

14:00.707 --> 14:02.242
(Jamie)
Am I right? I'm sorry.
Was that Latin?

14:02.342 --> 14:04.544
I'm a Classics professor
at Columbia University.

14:04.644 --> 14:05.378
I don't even know I'm doing it.

14:05.478 --> 14:08.115
- "Lovers are lunatics."
[laughter]

14:08.215 --> 14:09.182
I'd love to sit down
and pick your brain sometime.

14:10.050 --> 14:10.083
- Absolutely.
- You know what, Danny?

14:10.550 --> 14:11.451
I'm 34 years old.

14:12.485 --> 14:14.321
I cannot introduce
my parents to, yet, another guy,

14:14.421 --> 14:16.156
and have it not work out.

14:16.256 --> 14:18.959
Especially now, when I have
so much more to lose.

14:19.059 --> 14:20.360
Dr. C, do I feel bad
about what I did here today?

14:20.460 --> 14:22.429
Yeah, sure I do.

14:22.529 --> 14:23.897
You should've gone
to meet her parents, dude.

14:23.997 --> 14:25.966
Danny, why didn't you
just go?

14:26.066 --> 14:27.867
The procedure went late, okay?

14:27.968 --> 14:29.036
The party was in Boston--

14:29.136 --> 14:30.370
Ma, I had to shave, okay?

14:30.470 --> 14:32.539
Yeah, you clearly didn't shave,
Danny.

14:32.639 --> 14:33.540
- Yeah, no.
- Okay, fine.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.108
You want to know
why I didn't go?

14:35.208 --> 14:36.143
Here's why I didn't go,
'cause I was afraid

14:37.010 --> 14:37.044
that your parents
were gonna ask us

14:37.644 --> 14:38.145
why we weren't married.

14:38.745 --> 14:39.246
That's why I didn't go.

14:39.812 --> 14:40.447
So what's the big deal?

14:41.348 --> 14:42.149
You're gonna get married,
eventually.

14:42.815 --> 14:43.450
I don't know if we have to.

14:44.084 --> 14:47.420
I don't know if I want to.

14:47.520 --> 14:50.090
You don't?

14:50.190 --> 14:51.558
- Whoo.
- [gasps]

14:51.658 --> 14:55.595
No, I don't know.

14:55.695 --> 14:57.530
I love you,
but I don't know--

14:57.630 --> 14:59.332
I just don't know
about marriage.

14:59.432 --> 15:00.934
- Okay.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:01.034 --> 15:01.969

Hey.

Since when do you not want
to get married?

15:32.099 --> 15:33.366
I don't know.

15:33.466 --> 15:37.704
A while now, I guess.
Uh...

15:37.804 --> 15:39.139
since I got divorced.

15:39.239 --> 15:40.673
Well, you proposed to me

15:40.773 --> 15:42.575
when you found out
that I was pregnant.

15:42.675 --> 15:44.377
Because I thought
it was the right thing to do.

15:44.477 --> 15:47.147
Because I wanted you to know
I'm committed to you, Mindy,

15:47.247 --> 15:51.384
and this baby, and then you said
you didn't want to do it.

15:51.484 --> 15:54.687
And I got to be honest,
I was relieved.

15:54.787 --> 15:58.591
Yeah, but I never said
I never wanted to get married.

15:58.691 --> 16:01.561
I just wanted you to propose
because you love me,

16:01.661 --> 16:02.629

to get down on one knee,
and to meet your parents,

16:20.513 --> 16:21.614

I'll get you a ring,
