00:11.457 --> 00:14.369
Something is not right.

00:14.370 --> 00:15.961
Angry... very angry.

00:15.962 --> 00:18.530
I wake up with scratches.

00:18.531 --> 00:21.199
They're all losing it.

00:21.200 --> 00:23.157
There's a war going on.

00:23.158 --> 00:25.671
I see this thing, like,
whispering in their ear.

00:25.672 --> 00:27.409
It's something evil.

00:27.410 --> 00:29.223
They're kind of being possessed.

00:29.224 --> 00:30.966
This is demonic.

00:30.967 --> 00:33.244
They're trying to kill me.

00:33.245 --> 00:37.685
They're not safe anywhere in this house.

00:37.884 --> 00:39.618
They're being watched.

00:39.619 --> 00:42.739
My name is Amy Allan.

00:43.122 --> 00:45.323
This thing likes death.

00:45.324 --> 00:46.934
I see dead people.

00:46.935 --> 00:48.506
This thing's, like, a monster.

00:48.507 --> 00:50.611
I speak to dead people.

00:50.612 --> 00:52.263
And he's pissed off now.

00:52.264 --> 00:53.712
And they speak to me.

00:53.713 --> 00:55.200
His head was cracked.

00:55.201 --> 00:58.914
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:58.915 --> 01:00.138
This guy was murdered.

01:00.139 --> 01:01.813
I rely on my partner.

01:01.814 --> 01:05.169
I'm Steve Di Schiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective.

01:05.170 --> 01:07.980
I cannot help you unless
I know the whole story.

01:07.981 --> 01:11.198
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:11.199 --> 01:12.540
You saw her?

01:12.541 --> 01:13.853
It's my job to reveal them.

01:13.854 --> 01:15.020
Why would you stay here?

01:15.021 --> 01:17.184
But Steve and I never speak...

01:17.185 --> 01:19.314
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:19.315 --> 01:20.690
Until the very end.

01:20.691 --> 01:22.575
Stop it.

01:22.576 --> 01:24.408
We uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:24.409 --> 01:26.990
I want to know the truth. I
want to know what's happening.

01:26.991 --> 01:28.274
Or time to get out.

01:28.275 --> 01:33.015
I told you there were
ghosts in this house.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:49.022 --> 01:53.291
It's crucial that Amy and I
conduct separate investigations.

01:53.292 --> 01:56.716
I interview witnesses, research
the history of the location,

01:56.717 --> 02:02.617
and uncover secrets from the
past, while Amy speaks to the dead.

02:04.285 --> 02:06.912
I'm in the small resort
town of Watervliet, Michigan,

02:06.913 --> 02:09.295
a few hours outside of Detroit.

02:09.297 --> 02:11.932
Amy and I were called in
by a woman named Amanda.

02:11.933 --> 02:14.935
When I spoke to her on the
phone, her message was simple...

02:14.936 --> 02:18.572
You guys need to help me, or
this house is gonna kill me.

02:18.573 --> 02:24.473
Obviously, this is a serious situation,
and I'm hoping Amy and I can help her out.

02:28.817 --> 02:33.754
Before Amy arrives, I have to clear
the area of any leading information.

02:33.755 --> 02:38.125
I can tell from the photos alone
that a couple with kids live here.

02:38.126 --> 02:44.026
So I have to carefully remove any evidence
of this before Amy begins her walk.

02:58.079 --> 03:01.471
I'm seeing a lot of physical activity.

03:01.472 --> 03:04.354
There's something around that's...

03:04.355 --> 03:06.513
Uh, creepy.

03:06.514 --> 03:12.414
There's a dead person or entity
that's a controller of this location.

03:13.304 --> 03:15.328
I think it might be a child.

03:15.329 --> 03:18.735
Something about hidden truth, I think,
was specifically what they said...

03:18.736 --> 03:21.196
Hidden truth.

03:33.815 --> 03:36.532
Well, Amanda, you sounded
pretty desperate on the phone,

03:36.533 --> 03:38.185
so why don't you
explain what's happening?

03:38.186 --> 03:40.721
I'm beyond scared for my safety.

03:40.722 --> 03:43.492
I'm pretty much scared for my life.

03:43.493 --> 03:48.963
My health has seriously declined since
I moved back here three years ago.

03:48.964 --> 03:52.332
And because of that,
I've put on weight...

03:52.333 --> 03:56.134
And about two months
ago, I had a heart attack.

03:56.135 --> 03:58.358
- And you're how old now?
- 32.

03:58.359 --> 04:00.583
- That's really young for a heart attack.
- It is.

04:00.584 --> 04:03.270
Was it because of the weight gain
that this caused the heart attack,

04:03.271 --> 04:05.312
or did the doctor say
what may have caused it?

04:05.313 --> 04:10.124
They don't know what caused it. They
did tests, and there was no blockages.

04:10.125 --> 04:12.023
Okay. And what else has happened?

04:12.024 --> 04:14.568
I've been scratched and burned.

04:14.569 --> 04:20.110
I'm fearful for myself and for
my boyfriend and for his kids.

04:20.111 --> 04:21.389
Are they here all the time?

04:21.390 --> 04:23.831
No, they just come to
visit... usually on weekends.

04:23.832 --> 04:26.016
- Does anybody else live in the house?
- Yes.

04:26.017 --> 04:29.402
My mother and a friend of the family
does stay in the basement, as well.

04:29.403 --> 04:31.805
I'm gonna ask the obvious
thing... why are you staying here?

04:31.806 --> 04:37.706
I came back to the area because my dad
was sick, and finances are a big problem.

04:37.917 --> 04:40.394
What's your biggest concern, then?

04:40.395 --> 04:42.134
Dying.

04:42.135 --> 04:43.751
I feel like they're...

04:43.752 --> 04:46.486
They're systematically
trying to kill me...

04:46.487 --> 04:49.907
Whatever is in this house.

04:56.430 --> 05:01.770
There's this thing in this
house that's really bad.

05:04.472 --> 05:08.672
The people here have no ability to...

05:09.989 --> 05:13.169
Not be influenced by...

05:13.347 --> 05:15.249
These dead people.

05:15.250 --> 05:19.098
Like, they can be unhealthy, they
can't take care of themselves,

05:19.099 --> 05:22.255
they can't sleep and
can't eat right, and...

05:22.256 --> 05:25.569
Because either they eat too
much or they don't eat enough.

05:25.570 --> 05:30.010
They're not safe anywhere in this house.

05:30.687 --> 05:33.167
I started to sense that
the influential presence

05:33.168 --> 05:37.021
in this house was targeting
one person in particular.

05:37.022 --> 05:40.880
This thing can easily
access this person's mind.

05:40.881 --> 05:45.741
It can make this person
do anything it wants.

05:52.386 --> 05:55.990
So, what's happening in here?

05:55.991 --> 05:59.874
I wake up with scratches
and burns, actually.

05:59.875 --> 06:00.995
What do these look like?

06:00.996 --> 06:03.605
I have some pictures
here of some of them.

06:03.606 --> 06:06.786
- Okay.
- You can see.

06:09.104 --> 06:10.809
You just woke up and
that burn was there?

06:10.810 --> 06:11.612
Yeah.

06:11.613 --> 06:14.108
There a candle or anything
that could have did this to you?

06:14.109 --> 06:15.909
No.

06:16.064 --> 06:18.978
And this is none of the animals you're
living with or anything like that?

06:18.979 --> 06:20.877
No, absolutely not.

06:20.878 --> 06:24.163
So, Amanda, looking at this I would imagine
it's got to be tough sleeping at night.

06:24.164 --> 06:28.355
Yeah. Sometimes I find
myself sleepwalking.

06:28.356 --> 06:32.910
I've had bruises on my calves from
where I've run into things, and...

06:32.911 --> 06:35.963
It's, um... it's gotten out of control.

06:35.964 --> 06:38.966
I've developed sleep apnea and insomnia.

06:38.967 --> 06:41.396
When I do sleep, I have bad dreams.

06:41.397 --> 06:47.297
I had a dream that we were driving Mike's
kids home and we were hit by a semi.

06:51.780 --> 06:56.750
I see this thing, like, kind of standing
at this person's back, being like...

06:56.751 --> 06:59.052
You know, like, whispering in their ear,

06:59.053 --> 07:02.256
like, do this or do that,
and the person can't sleep.

07:02.257 --> 07:04.691
And if they sleep, then it's really bad,

07:04.692 --> 07:07.460
like invasions in the
sleep or something like...

07:07.461 --> 07:09.141
What do you mean?

07:09.142 --> 07:11.563
Maybe it's like a trance state.

07:11.564 --> 07:15.669
Like, they're seeing where they're going,
but they don't have any control over it.

07:15.670 --> 07:18.071
You know, and then
they're, like, startled...

07:18.072 --> 07:19.884
- Okay...
- Which is really...

07:19.885 --> 07:23.725
Kind of unnerving, uh, because...

07:24.645 --> 07:26.880
Well, then they're
kind of being possessed.

07:26.881 --> 07:29.101
Possessed.

07:35.824 --> 07:38.926
What's going on in the kitchen?

07:38.927 --> 07:43.363
One time, I was just grabbing
something out of the pantry,

07:43.364 --> 07:47.090
and I turned around, and there
was a man standing next to me.

07:47.091 --> 07:48.837
Okay. So, describe him for me.

07:48.838 --> 07:51.972
- He was a little taller than I was, thin.
- Okay.

07:51.973 --> 07:55.664
He had a square jaw
and a button-down shirt.

07:55.665 --> 07:59.385
If you were to see a photo, would you be
able to recognize if it's the same person?

07:59.386 --> 08:02.950
Yeah. I think he was trying to warn me
that there's something else in the house.

08:02.951 --> 08:05.510
And that I needed to
do something about it.

08:05.511 --> 08:07.431
Okay.

08:15.196 --> 08:18.736
Something is not right here.

08:19.787 --> 08:22.487
This is a male.

08:22.860 --> 08:25.281
And he is not that old.

08:25.282 --> 08:28.642
He is, like, in his 50s.

08:28.809 --> 08:30.945
He's, like...

08:30.946 --> 08:33.765
Angry. Very angry.

08:35.082 --> 08:38.082
Something in this
house is wreaking havoc,

08:38.083 --> 08:41.179
but I don't think this angry man
is the one influencing the living.

08:41.181 --> 08:43.316
He's not advanced enough.

08:43.317 --> 08:46.793
He's just getting pissed
off and beating on the walls.

08:46.794 --> 08:48.591
And, like, stomping on the floors.

08:48.592 --> 08:52.065
He's trying to put it back
the way he knows it to be.

08:52.066 --> 08:57.966
Like, he's trying to take down the
things that don't make sense to him.

08:57.979 --> 09:03.879
This is where the scariest thing
that I've encountered happened.

09:04.512 --> 09:07.385
I felt like I was in
some sort of trance...

09:07.386 --> 09:11.360
And I came out of it, and
I found myself standing...

09:11.361 --> 09:13.812
At the kitchen counter,
spinning a knife.

09:13.813 --> 09:17.204
- Spinning a knife?
- Yes.

09:17.205 --> 09:21.795
I later realized that I was having
a lot of negative thoughts...

09:21.796 --> 09:23.363
Suicidal thoughts.

09:23.364 --> 09:26.400
Okay. Now, have you ever
had suicidal thoughts before?

09:26.401 --> 09:27.401
No.

09:27.402 --> 09:29.554
Did you ever have it again in the house?

09:29.555 --> 09:30.603
No.

09:30.604 --> 09:32.806
Did you tell your boyfriend about it?

09:32.807 --> 09:35.242
- No, I didn't tell anyone.
- Why not?

09:35.243 --> 09:37.444
They're already worried for my health.

09:37.445 --> 09:41.292
I don't want them to worry
about me taking my life.

09:41.293 --> 09:45.313
I think that whatever's in here...

09:45.555 --> 09:48.231
Is trying to kill me,
one way or another...

09:48.232 --> 09:54.132
Either through my health or
through making me take my own life.

09:57.346 --> 10:00.286
What is this thing?

10:00.433 --> 10:03.133
It feels like...

10:03.332 --> 10:05.492
A child?

10:05.873 --> 10:07.907
I feel like...

10:07.908 --> 10:10.800
That it would be a girl.

10:10.801 --> 10:13.861
12- or 13-year-old.

10:14.105 --> 10:17.885
She looks like a shadow person.

10:19.753 --> 10:22.422
She's bad. Whoa!

10:22.423 --> 10:24.943
What happened?

10:26.361 --> 10:28.503
This girl...

10:28.504 --> 10:30.784
Zapped me.

10:31.615 --> 10:34.795
She [Bleep] ran at me.

10:35.336 --> 10:37.471
I didn't expect this at all.

10:37.472 --> 10:41.841
The entity that's tormenting the
people in this house is a little girl.

10:41.842 --> 10:45.778
She's pretty strong. She
knows what she's doing.

10:45.779 --> 10:48.215
She took all my energy.

10:48.216 --> 10:53.487
She tries to control all
the people that come here.

10:53.488 --> 10:59.388
I think she's influenced somebody to
either commit suicide or kill someone.

11:02.963 --> 11:06.372
So, this room is the room
that I made for Mike's kids.

11:06.373 --> 11:07.647
Okay. How old are they?

11:07.648 --> 11:10.634
His son is 11, and his daughter is 12.

11:10.635 --> 11:12.433
Have the kids experienced
anything up here?

11:12.434 --> 11:16.234
Just last weekend, Mike's
son had experiences.

11:16.235 --> 11:19.679
- What happened?
- He saw red eyes staring at him.

11:19.680 --> 11:23.100
- Where?
- In the hallway.

11:24.152 --> 11:26.780
- Were the dogs up here?
- No. The dogs are never up here.

11:26.781 --> 11:28.776
Amanda, let me ask you a
question, are you worried

11:28.777 --> 11:30.685
that something's gonna
happen to the kids?

11:30.686 --> 11:32.906
Certainly.

11:36.564 --> 11:40.175
This little girl... she's jealous.

11:40.176 --> 11:43.670
Jealousy between this girl and...

11:43.671 --> 11:46.851
And whoever's in here.

11:47.041 --> 11:49.612
Bad. That's not good.

11:49.613 --> 11:52.760
You said that she might
try to influence the living?

11:52.761 --> 11:57.441
- Mm-hmm.
- Do you know who that would be?

11:57.818 --> 12:00.331
- It's an adult.
- What does she want?

12:00.332 --> 12:03.223
To make her kill them.

12:03.224 --> 12:05.444
Kill who?

12:06.087 --> 12:09.327
Whoever's in this room.

12:34.061 --> 12:38.482
So, Mike, I spoke with Amanda, and she
explained what's going on in the house.

12:38.483 --> 12:39.699
And her concerns.

12:39.700 --> 12:41.935
- Have you had experiences here?
- Yes, I have.

12:41.936 --> 12:44.485
I actually had a few
experiences in the bedroom.

12:44.486 --> 12:47.007
Sleeping at night, I feel like
there's somebody crawling in bed.

12:47.008 --> 12:50.312
I can feel the bed pressing down like
somebody's crawling in bed with me...

12:50.313 --> 12:51.125
Right.

12:51.126 --> 12:53.479
When Amanda will be up in
the living room watching TV.

12:53.480 --> 12:55.682
The first time, it
scared me, and it happened

12:55.683 --> 12:57.502
for about two weeks
after that... every night.

12:57.503 --> 13:00.386
Did it feel like a human or maybe one
of the dogs? What did it feel like?

13:00.387 --> 13:01.788
It felt like a human.

13:01.789 --> 13:03.379
Okay. Anything else?

13:03.380 --> 13:05.076
I've heard, actually, a voice.

13:05.077 --> 13:07.861
Again, we were in there,
watching TV again at night,

13:07.862 --> 13:10.430
and I heard somebody
whisper, how you doing?

13:10.431 --> 13:13.233
And I looked at Amanda. I said,
did you say something to me?

13:13.234 --> 13:14.999
She said, no.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.888
Now, when they said, how you
doing? Was it a female or a...?

13:17.889 --> 13:20.649
It was a female.

13:24.846 --> 13:29.226
She likes to be as scary as possible...

13:29.917 --> 13:34.080
And she's actually pretty good at it.

13:34.081 --> 13:36.565
Like, she crawls in bed with this person

13:36.566 --> 13:41.606
and acts like it's sleeping
with... this person.

13:44.098 --> 13:47.053
She yells and screams...

13:47.054 --> 13:49.454
And howls...

13:51.105 --> 13:57.005
Which I would think that the living
would probably be able to hear.

14:02.583 --> 14:04.035
It's very scary for me,

14:04.036 --> 14:06.920
because it doesn't seem like I'm
in control when this is happening.

14:06.921 --> 14:09.082
I have had fits of rage.

14:09.083 --> 14:13.075
I get mad over the littlest
things... a question being asked.

14:13.076 --> 14:15.728
I'm afraid that I'm gonna
hurt somebody in the house.

14:15.729 --> 14:18.296
- And that's not in your nature?
- No, Sir. No, Sir.

14:18.297 --> 14:20.341
Do you feel it's when you're
here you get like that?

14:20.342 --> 14:21.145
Yes.

14:21.146 --> 14:23.709
That's got to be a strain on your
relationship with Amanda, also.

14:23.710 --> 14:24.737
Yes, it is.

14:24.738 --> 14:26.832
What do you think is
going on in this house?

14:26.833 --> 14:29.838
I think it's something evil.

14:29.839 --> 14:32.810
- Why don't you just move out?
- Because I love her, you know and,

14:32.811 --> 14:38.711
we care for each other and we're
helping each other out through this.

14:41.122 --> 14:43.762
So, the girl...

14:43.925 --> 14:48.905
She can go anywhere she
wants to in the house.

14:48.914 --> 14:51.662
She can make them feel agitated.

14:51.663 --> 14:53.498
Attaching herself to them.

14:53.499 --> 14:58.239
Draining their energy,
making them feel sick.

15:03.044 --> 15:06.055
So, Pat, I was talking to your
daughter, and I wanted to talk to you.

15:06.056 --> 15:07.706
- I understand you live here.
- Yeah.

15:07.707 --> 15:09.149
You've been living here a long time.

15:09.150 --> 15:11.162
- Close to 17 years.
- 17 years?

15:11.163 --> 15:13.586
So, have you experienced
anything since you've been here?

15:13.587 --> 15:15.055
No.

15:15.056 --> 15:16.676
Why do you think that is?

15:16.677 --> 15:20.123
I have a relationship with the Lord.

15:20.124 --> 15:23.729
And I think that keeps me from seeing...

15:23.730 --> 15:28.170
Or experiencing
anything that is demonic.

15:28.484 --> 15:30.484
And I believe this is demonic.

15:30.485 --> 15:32.617
So, you believe that Amanda
is telling me the truth?

15:32.618 --> 15:34.507
I do, absolutely.

15:34.508 --> 15:38.998
Amanda's at risk right now.
They're warring over her.

15:38.999 --> 15:40.913
Why her?

15:40.914 --> 15:44.917
Because I believe that God
has a special purpose for her.

15:44.918 --> 15:47.802
And she hasn't stepped up to it.

15:47.803 --> 15:52.610
And I still try to encourage
her to get back to the faith.

15:52.611 --> 15:55.306
And you believe that if she found
her way back to the church...

15:55.307 --> 15:59.199
It doesn't even have to be church...
just finds her way back to God,

15:59.200 --> 16:02.320
that that would cease.

16:02.903 --> 16:07.007
It's really hard to watch as a parent.

16:07.008 --> 16:10.464
I pray that there is a solution.

16:10.465 --> 16:14.545
That she can be the vibrant person.

16:14.553 --> 16:16.767
And have the full life...

16:16.768 --> 16:20.413
You know, the active
life that she deserves.

16:20.414 --> 16:22.801
She already had a heart attack.

16:22.802 --> 16:26.402
You worried about losing her?

16:26.973 --> 16:29.529
It crosses my mind.

16:29.530 --> 16:32.609
I try not to dwell on the negative.

16:32.610 --> 16:35.402
I know that there's a plan.

16:35.403 --> 16:38.138
What are you hoping that Amy
and I can do for your daughter?

16:38.139 --> 16:40.940
I really have no expectations.

16:40.941 --> 16:45.581
I really don't think that
there's anything that can be done.

16:45.582 --> 16:49.567
It's only the power of the
Lord that's gonna handle it.

16:49.568 --> 16:55.468
There's a war going on between
God's Angels and the Devil's Demons.

17:04.643 --> 17:10.542
There's, like, really, really,
really bad, bad things down here.

17:10.615 --> 17:14.515
Not where I'd be wanting to be.

17:17.278 --> 17:20.613
What the [Bleep] is this?

17:20.614 --> 17:24.561
This old man putzing around
and being grumpy and...

17:24.563 --> 17:27.685
Just always angry and pissed off and,

17:27.685 --> 17:30.901
just unhappy and miserable
about his life and...

17:30.902 --> 17:34.395
Hates that somebody is down here...

17:34.396 --> 17:37.406
Hates that somebody is in its...

17:37.407 --> 17:39.927
In its space.

17:40.493 --> 17:42.653
He um...

17:43.123 --> 17:45.171
Gets angry.

17:45.172 --> 17:48.074
Whoever hangs out
down here is his focus.

17:48.075 --> 17:53.235
And I think he tries to
kill them at some point.

18:06.001 --> 18:08.109
I really feel for Amanda.

18:08.110 --> 18:12.779
For her, this investigation
is literally life and death.

18:12.780 --> 18:15.175
Now I'm heading over to
meet with a town historian...

18:15.176 --> 18:21.076
Who says Amanda's property is a
big part of Watervliet's history.

18:26.734 --> 18:28.799
The property you're
investigating, Steve,

18:28.800 --> 18:32.560
was purchased and
developed by Isaac Swain.

18:32.561 --> 18:35.501
In the early 1830s.

18:36.017 --> 18:39.460
In addition, they had
vast holdings of property,

18:39.461 --> 18:44.783
which, at that particular time, was
all undeveloped forests and woodlands.

18:44.784 --> 18:50.684
And you can see where he has his name
on all of these different plots of land.

18:53.788 --> 18:55.880
And how much property do
you think he had altogether?

18:55.881 --> 18:58.333
Upwards of 900 acres.

18:58.334 --> 19:01.406
How did Swain make his mark
when he was living here?

19:01.407 --> 19:02.546
What did he do?

19:02.547 --> 19:05.646
Well, he was renowned
for his lumber mill.

19:05.647 --> 19:08.570
He had upwards of 50
employees working for him.

19:08.571 --> 19:11.119
It was the biggest
mill in Berrien County.

19:11.120 --> 19:12.980
Wow.

19:20.006 --> 19:23.182
I'm just seeing, like, woods...

19:23.183 --> 19:26.963
Uh, thick woods, lots of trees.

19:30.408 --> 19:36.201
All I'm getting is somebody, like,
saying, too bad about, you know, the trees.

19:36.202 --> 19:38.678
This little old lady's saying,
like, too bad about the trees,

19:38.679 --> 19:43.059
like, that they cut down all the trees.

19:44.438 --> 19:47.907
Daryl knew very little about
Isaac Swain's personal life.

19:47.908 --> 19:50.306
So I'm on my way to meet a local author,

19:50.307 --> 19:56.207
who says Swain's time in Watervliet
was filled with heartbreak.

20:01.656 --> 20:04.323
This guy, Isaac Swain, what
were you able to find out?

20:04.324 --> 20:06.960
Well, Isaac Swain and his
wife came to Watervliet.

20:06.961 --> 20:09.663
- And they had three children.
- Okay.

20:09.664 --> 20:11.583
He had a daughter named Martha...

20:11.584 --> 20:14.527
- Okay.
- And she died at the age of 15.

20:14.528 --> 20:19.089
- From what?
- Records back then didn't really specify.

20:19.090 --> 20:23.429
Then their youngest son,
who was age 3, William,

20:23.430 --> 20:25.687
passes away suddenly.

20:25.688 --> 20:29.864
- Right after she died, or...
- Exactly... within two years.

20:29.865 --> 20:33.987
But it doesn't stop there.
Their second daughter, Louisa...

20:33.988 --> 20:38.347
She had a tragic accident, and it's
hard to tell what exactly happened,

20:38.348 --> 20:42.376
but somewhere between
the ages of 10 and 14,

20:42.377 --> 20:45.513
she fell and hit her head so hard...

20:45.514 --> 20:49.002
That she became mentally disabled.

20:49.003 --> 20:50.375
She was basically an invalid?

20:50.376 --> 20:53.768
She basically was. She
had to have 24-hour care.

20:53.769 --> 20:57.102
I assume Isaac and his wife stayed in the
area and took care of the remaining child.

20:57.103 --> 21:02.023
For a while, they did, but, actually,
the wife, Vallonia, started to get sick,

21:02.024 --> 21:06.165
and I actually found a
picture of her for you.

21:06.166 --> 21:08.004
Now, do we know what
kind of illness she had?

21:08.005 --> 21:12.728
The symptoms that they described
were somewhat similar to Tuberculosis.

21:12.729 --> 21:17.305
It was important to Isaac to make sure
that she had the best care possible.

21:17.306 --> 21:19.914
- You're talking about his wife, Vallonia?
- Yes.

21:19.915 --> 21:22.779
So, what they did for three years...

21:22.780 --> 21:27.496
Was travel around the northeast,
actually looking for someone to help them,

21:27.497 --> 21:30.019
doctors... looking for
a different environment...

21:30.020 --> 21:32.938
- Right.
- In hopes that this would help cure her.

21:32.939 --> 21:35.864
- Does she get cured? What happens?
- No. Unfortunately...

21:35.865 --> 21:38.700
She does not get cured, and she...

21:38.701 --> 21:41.461
Succumbs to this.

21:42.900 --> 21:46.986
Would they have taken Louisa with
them on this three-year journey?

21:46.987 --> 21:51.996
Louisa was likely not taken with
them because she needed constant care.

21:51.997 --> 21:56.384
She lived with the staff
people and the caretakers.

21:56.385 --> 21:58.884
There was a certain
amount of stigma associated

21:58.885 --> 22:01.600
with somebody with a
mental disability back then.

22:01.601 --> 22:03.497
She had no social
interaction whatsoever?

22:03.498 --> 22:04.936
Very little. Very little.

22:04.937 --> 22:07.006
And the only people that she really knew

22:07.007 --> 22:09.841
- was her own family and her caretakers.
- Caretakers.

22:09.842 --> 22:15.182
And when her family passed
away, she was left alone.

22:19.052 --> 22:22.054
This girl... she died...

22:22.055 --> 22:24.390
Do you know when this was?

22:24.391 --> 22:26.625
A while ago.

22:26.626 --> 22:29.690
Well, I'd say at least 100 years.

22:29.691 --> 22:33.532
The young girl that's been
stalking me is extremely powerful.

22:33.533 --> 22:38.448
And I'm starting to see what's
causing her to torment the living here.

22:38.449 --> 22:41.907
She has a lot of pain
that she's dealing with.

22:41.908 --> 22:46.588
- A lot of pain?
- Yeah, physical, physical.

22:47.770 --> 22:50.649
And she's not herself.

22:50.650 --> 22:54.070
She was mentally not okay.

22:54.773 --> 22:57.423
And she puts it like she
likes to play with people,

22:57.424 --> 23:01.347
because she wasn't allowed to play
with people when she was alive.

23:01.348 --> 23:03.895
Well, and then she was
just screaming at me

23:03.896 --> 23:07.803
through the... you
know, through the wall.

23:07.804 --> 23:09.601
She's kind of creepy, though.

23:09.602 --> 23:13.742
She's creeping me out a little bit.

23:27.864 --> 23:29.792
I'm at the local library to see what

23:29.793 --> 23:33.689
else I can find out
about Amanda's problem.

23:33.690 --> 23:34.917
Digging through the archives,

23:34.918 --> 23:38.497
I uncover an obituary of a
young woman named Sadie Smith.

23:38.498 --> 23:41.318
Who died in 1918.

23:43.847 --> 23:46.148
The location of her funeral...

23:46.149 --> 23:49.449
My client's living room.

23:53.919 --> 23:57.659
So, not only does a 32-year-old woman
die on the property I'm investigating,

23:57.660 --> 24:00.359
they held her funeral
right inside the house.

24:00.360 --> 24:02.797
I'm on my way to meet with
a local funeral Director

24:02.798 --> 24:08.698
who promised to look into the town
records and give me the whole story.

24:16.985 --> 24:20.050
Roland, I know from other
cases, back in the early days,

24:20.051 --> 24:22.517
that people did hold
funerals in their homes.

24:22.518 --> 24:24.405
Now, was that common in this area?

24:24.406 --> 24:27.205
Back in 1918, probably 90% of the time,

24:27.206 --> 24:29.491
funerals were held in the home, yes.

24:29.492 --> 24:33.862
Now, Sadie... it said she died from
influenza, what were you able to find out?

24:33.863 --> 24:38.512
Well, I was able to obtain a
copy of the death certificate.

24:38.513 --> 24:42.317
And she obtained Spanish influenza
and had it for about a week,

24:42.318 --> 24:45.953
and then passed away of heart failure.

24:45.954 --> 24:50.445
Possibly, the reason they held the wake
in the house was to contain the influenza.

24:50.446 --> 24:53.148
She was young... 32.
So, she wasn't married?

24:53.149 --> 24:54.649
No, never married.

24:54.650 --> 24:56.402
- No children?
- No children.

24:56.403 --> 24:58.487
So, it had to be tough on
the parents, I would think.

24:58.488 --> 25:01.368
Probably was, yeah.

25:08.654 --> 25:13.399
Something took place here
where people were crying and...

25:13.400 --> 25:15.620
Screaming.

25:16.505 --> 25:18.436
There was a funeral here.

25:18.437 --> 25:22.251
Where they had the
casket, and it was open,

25:22.252 --> 25:25.972
and people were saying goodbye.

25:27.550 --> 25:30.790
This is a young female.

25:31.321 --> 25:36.421
They're all crying,
freaking out, just losing it.

25:39.628 --> 25:42.530
So, Roland, what happened with
the parents after Sadie dies?

25:42.531 --> 25:44.332
They stayed in the home.

25:44.333 --> 25:45.894
Okay. So, she lived with her parents?

25:45.895 --> 25:48.856
Yes, and shortly after
Sadie passed away,

25:48.857 --> 25:53.575
the mother, Evelyn, was in frail health
for about five years and passed away.

25:53.576 --> 25:59.149
Steve, I was able to find the
obituary in the local newspaper on...

25:59.150 --> 26:01.490
Mrs. Smith.

26:02.185 --> 26:04.152
And how old was she when she died?

26:04.153 --> 26:05.519
She was 67.

26:05.520 --> 26:07.489
Did she die of natural causes?

26:07.490 --> 26:09.305
Natural causes there, also...

26:09.306 --> 26:11.860
- From a heart disease.
- Okay.

26:11.861 --> 26:14.096
The funeral was not held
in that home, though.

26:14.097 --> 26:18.733
They went back to the homestead out
south of town and had her funeral there.

26:18.734 --> 26:20.768
So, Roland, what happened with the dad?

26:20.769 --> 26:25.173
His name was John Wallace Smith, and he
lived in the house for a few more years,

26:25.174 --> 26:29.965
and then he passed away, and I found
his obituary in the local paper, also.

26:29.966 --> 26:31.235
And what'd he die of?

26:31.236 --> 26:33.575
Natural causes from
a cerebral hemorrhage.

26:33.576 --> 26:36.385
So, Sadie dies, the mother
dies about five years later,

26:36.386 --> 26:40.088
and then the father dies a few years
after that, and they all died in the home?

26:40.089 --> 26:42.909
In the home, yes.

26:46.577 --> 26:50.453
So, I'm thinking the elderly man...

26:50.454 --> 26:53.944
Is mad that someone is in...

26:53.945 --> 26:56.106
His space.

26:56.107 --> 27:00.787
I think he spent a
lot of time down here.

27:01.112 --> 27:03.401
I'm following this angry
man around the basement

27:03.402 --> 27:07.582
as he vents to me about how much
he hates the people living here.

27:07.583 --> 27:12.287
Something tragic happened to him, and now
I'm experiencing all the pain he endured.

27:12.288 --> 27:17.568
Oh [Bleep] I'm getting a
really sharp [Bleep] pain.

27:17.593 --> 27:21.373
Ooh, what the [Bleep] was that?

27:22.059 --> 27:24.686
Then that pain, the head...

27:24.687 --> 27:28.107
That could be an aneurysm.

27:55.531 --> 27:58.327
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

27:58.328 --> 28:03.769
we're ready to reveal our findings to each
other and our clients for the first time.

28:03.770 --> 28:05.968
Amy, I want you to meet Amanda and Mike.

28:05.969 --> 28:10.865
Amanda called us in because she's had some
serious health issues since she moved in.

28:10.866 --> 28:15.134
She's even had a heart attack,
and she's only 32 years old.

28:15.135 --> 28:19.874
Doctors have no explanation for it, but
Amanda thinks she knows what's going on.

28:19.875 --> 28:22.791
She actually thinks that
this house is killing her.

28:22.792 --> 28:24.932
With that, I'm gonna
turn it over to Amy,

28:24.933 --> 28:29.733
and she can start
telling us about her walk.

28:31.424 --> 28:34.325
So, I came into this room here,

28:34.326 --> 28:38.196
and I saw a funeral taking place,

28:38.197 --> 28:40.240
for a young female.

28:40.241 --> 28:44.211
There was a casket, it was open, and
people were saying their goodbyes.

28:44.212 --> 28:46.123
Well, there was a funeral in this home.

28:46.124 --> 28:50.027
Back in 1914, a girl, Sadie
Smith, moved here to this house.

28:50.028 --> 28:55.928
But four years after she moved in here,
in 1918, Sadie dies of the Spanish flu.

28:56.567 --> 28:59.727
The flu weakened her heart
until it just gave out.

28:59.728 --> 29:02.572
I have her death certificate here.

29:02.573 --> 29:05.876
They have here listed, heart failure.

29:05.877 --> 29:07.737
Wow.

29:10.938 --> 29:14.962
Oh, my God. Is that her
birth date or her death date?

29:14.963 --> 29:16.186
Birth.

29:16.187 --> 29:19.847
It's three days off of mine.

29:20.614 --> 29:23.014
Oh, my God.

29:24.423 --> 29:27.303
That's just crazy.

29:28.640 --> 29:30.832
What else did you see?

29:30.833 --> 29:34.881
I went to the basement,
and there's this...

29:34.882 --> 29:38.112
Very angry little old man down there.

29:38.113 --> 29:40.244
He believes that that's his space,

29:40.245 --> 29:45.451
and he despises whoever is
residing there right now.

29:45.452 --> 29:48.905
In fact, he's trying
to scare the person.

29:48.906 --> 29:52.562
Um, so that the person will leave.

29:52.563 --> 29:56.760
When I was talking to this guy, I
got this really sharp pain in my head.

29:56.761 --> 30:00.903
And I felt like he had
passed from an aneurysm.

30:00.904 --> 30:06.804
Now, Sadie's parents lived here, and
they actually both died in the house.

30:07.705 --> 30:12.203
The father, John, died at the
age of 73 of cerebral hemorrhage.

30:12.204 --> 30:14.724
Wow. Oh, wow.

30:15.146 --> 30:16.910
The tenant downstairs...

30:16.911 --> 30:19.402
He claims he's seen
some things down there.

30:19.403 --> 30:22.352
- Like what?
- Shadows, five to six times.

30:22.353 --> 30:27.023
He's told me one time that he actually
sees a man standing in the doorway here.

30:27.024 --> 30:28.031
Okay.

30:28.032 --> 30:31.754
You know what? Tell Amy about
the apparition that you saw.

30:31.755 --> 30:33.596
I was in the laundry room,

30:33.597 --> 30:38.028
and I was just grabbing something out
of the cabinet, and I turned around,

30:38.029 --> 30:41.737
and there was a man
standing right next to me.

30:41.738 --> 30:44.576
I jumped and screamed,
and then he disappeared.

30:44.577 --> 30:48.511
- What was he wearing?
- A button-down shirt, and...

30:48.512 --> 30:50.921
- He had a five o'clock shadow.
- Okay.

30:50.922 --> 30:52.637
And dark hair.

30:52.638 --> 30:57.524
I briefly encountered another
male back in that area.

30:57.525 --> 30:59.159
Oh, my God.

30:59.160 --> 31:02.996
And I did do a sketch of the man.

31:02.997 --> 31:05.867
He's in his early 70s...

31:05.868 --> 31:08.808
He does have jowls.

31:09.077 --> 31:13.217
And his eyes are very almond-shaped.

31:16.311 --> 31:20.165
Well, you tell me.
You would know better.

31:20.166 --> 31:22.566
Oh, my God.

31:25.266 --> 31:28.626
It looks a lot like him.

31:29.156 --> 31:31.012
I'll never forget him.

31:31.013 --> 31:34.553
He was looking right at me.

31:35.121 --> 31:38.922
He was just confused, so
he just gets frustrated.

31:38.923 --> 31:41.213
- Do you ever hear banging or anything?
- All the time.

31:41.214 --> 31:44.454
- All the time.
- Okay.

31:45.124 --> 31:47.608
So, what else did you see?

31:47.609 --> 31:50.780
In my opening, what
I saw was actually...

31:50.781 --> 31:54.921
This house surrounded by thick trees.

31:55.154 --> 31:58.785
I was shocked, because, obviously,
there's no trees. It's all houses.

31:58.786 --> 32:01.801
And then when I went in the
backyard, I heard an old lady.

32:01.802 --> 32:05.896
She was agitated that the
trees had been removed.

32:05.897 --> 32:10.397
Well, it makes sense you said that, because
this was owned by a guy named Isaac Swain.

32:10.398 --> 32:13.665
Back in the 1800s, he
purchased the property here.

32:13.666 --> 32:16.606
This was all woods.

32:17.972 --> 32:23.076
He came here, he bought the
property, and he opened up a mill.

32:23.077 --> 32:27.648
He made a lot of money, but he also
had a lot of tragedy with his family.

32:27.649 --> 32:29.182
Oh.

32:29.183 --> 32:31.043
Wow.

32:31.427 --> 32:34.288
I saw this little girl.

32:34.289 --> 32:37.556
- She's the most important person here.
- Mm-hmm.

32:37.557 --> 32:41.306
She kind of controls or
runs most of the house.

32:41.307 --> 32:45.832
She's between 10 and 12, and she's
been here for a very long time...

32:45.833 --> 32:48.064
At least over 100 years.

32:48.065 --> 32:49.952
But she's in a lot pain.

32:49.953 --> 32:53.940
Because she was in some
kind of weird accident.

32:53.941 --> 32:58.201
And, mentally, she's not who she was.

32:58.493 --> 33:01.644
She wasn't allowed to play.
She wasn't allowed to do things.

33:01.645 --> 33:04.828
She wasn't really allowed
to interact with people.

33:04.829 --> 33:07.824
Well, I didn't have to
think much about this one.

33:07.825 --> 33:10.719
Isaac Swain had a daughter, Louisa.

33:10.720 --> 33:15.386
Between the ages of 10 and 14,
she actually hit her head...

33:15.387 --> 33:17.159
- And soon after that...
- Oh, man.

33:17.160 --> 33:21.034
- She became mentally incapacitated.
- Oh.

33:21.035 --> 33:25.952
She basically couldn't care for herself.
She had to have care all the time.

33:25.953 --> 33:30.587
The thing is, she had two
siblings, both of which passed away.

33:30.588 --> 33:32.312
Whoa. What?

33:32.313 --> 33:35.481
One was Martha. She
died at the age of 15.

33:35.482 --> 33:39.152
And she had a younger brother,
William, who died at 3 in 1849.

33:39.153 --> 33:40.588
Wow.

33:40.589 --> 33:43.729
Things got worse for
her, because her mom...

33:43.730 --> 33:47.473
This is Vallonia...
she got sick, very sick.

33:47.474 --> 33:51.431
Her husband took her on a 3-year
journey all around the northeast,

33:51.432 --> 33:56.603
the East Coast, looking for help,
searching for a cure for her.

33:56.604 --> 34:01.610
This kid was left alone
at the house with nurses.

34:01.611 --> 34:03.546
You know, she lived
the rest of her life...

34:03.547 --> 34:05.553
As an invalid.

34:05.554 --> 34:10.650
What I got was that she does affect
everyone in the house to some extent.

34:10.650 --> 34:13.646
She can make people overeat...

34:13.647 --> 34:18.627
She can drain energy,
make people feel agitated.

34:18.666 --> 34:20.510
- Oh, my God.
- She affects sleep...

34:20.511 --> 34:25.197
Can make people have terrible
dreams, or sleepwalk, which is big.

34:25.199 --> 34:27.168
She climbs into bed with them,

34:27.168 --> 34:30.504
and she can jump inside
that person and control them.

34:30.505 --> 34:33.496
- Oh, my God.
- She affects everyone, but she...

34:33.496 --> 34:39.397
Has her sights set on one person
in this house in particular.

34:39.616 --> 34:43.527
She stays by this person all the time.

34:43.529 --> 34:45.389
Wow.

34:46.034 --> 34:48.726
Yeah, it's definitely me.

34:48.728 --> 34:52.378
One time, I got up to
go to the bathroom...

34:52.379 --> 34:55.123
And the next thing I knew,

34:55.125 --> 34:58.679
I was spinning a knife on the counter.

34:58.680 --> 35:01.635
I didn't know I was doing
it. It was, like, not me.

35:01.636 --> 35:07.001
All I could think was, I
should just get it over with.

35:07.002 --> 35:12.522
I'm gonna die anyway. I
should just get it over with.

35:13.271 --> 35:15.415
- And you mentioned agitated?
- Mm-hmm.

35:15.416 --> 35:17.409
Well, Mike's having issues.

35:17.410 --> 35:20.694
Yeah. I get mad at the littlest things.

35:20.695 --> 35:26.460
I've been mad at her for no reason, and
then I'll go outside, and my rage is gone.

35:26.461 --> 35:30.078
She's trying to control you both.

35:30.079 --> 35:32.479
Oh, my God.

35:32.533 --> 35:35.953
Now, she's been scratched.

35:38.115 --> 35:39.975
Wow.

35:41.483 --> 35:45.011
That's her neck. That's
one of the scratch marks.

35:45.012 --> 35:47.914
And she's had them on her
stomach, on the side there.

35:47.915 --> 35:50.851
- Okay.
- And this is a burn mark, she thinks.

35:50.852 --> 35:52.819
Can that be from the little girl?

35:52.820 --> 35:57.999
Yeah. Well, she's always holding
on, touching you constantly.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.541
Is that who was crawling
in the bed with him?

36:00.542 --> 36:03.656
Oh, she likes to do that.

36:03.657 --> 36:09.503
So, I did a sketch of this little girl
and the person that she's focused on.

36:09.504 --> 36:11.424
Okay.

36:17.748 --> 36:20.268
Jesus [Bleep].

36:25.401 --> 36:27.261
Wow.

36:27.733 --> 36:30.133
Oh, my God.

36:30.276 --> 36:33.576
So, she's always by me?

36:35.104 --> 36:37.384
Holy crap.

36:54.946 --> 37:00.418
I did a sketch of this little girl
and the person that she's focused on.

37:00.419 --> 37:02.339
Okay.

37:08.827 --> 37:11.347
Jesus [Bleep].

37:16.628 --> 37:18.488
Wow.

37:18.907 --> 37:21.307
Oh, my God.

37:21.520 --> 37:24.820
So, she's always by me?

37:26.308 --> 37:28.588
Holy crap.

37:41.562 --> 37:44.452
She's extremely powerful.

37:44.453 --> 37:47.794
At one point, she charged me and took...

37:47.795 --> 37:51.995
All of my energy, like, in a second.

37:52.552 --> 37:58.452
Then I saw a very disturbing scene in
the upstairs bedroom with the two beds.

37:58.701 --> 38:02.421
You could feel this jealousy...

38:02.628 --> 38:06.337
That she had for the
people in that room.

38:06.338 --> 38:11.138
And her intention was
to murder those people.

38:12.675 --> 38:17.175
And those thoughts
were being put into...

38:17.606 --> 38:19.274
The person's mind.

38:19.275 --> 38:21.391
What person are you talking about?

38:21.392 --> 38:24.392
Well, basically, you.

38:25.801 --> 38:30.241
You would be her vessel to do the deed.

38:30.278 --> 38:36.178
She wants to get to the point where she can
control you 100% so that you'll do this.

38:36.194 --> 38:37.823
You okay?

38:37.824 --> 38:39.624
No.

38:39.899 --> 38:42.239
Not really.

38:42.843 --> 38:48.123
Well, that room upstairs
is where Mike's kids stay.

38:59.819 --> 39:03.974
I thought something was
attached to me. I did.

39:03.975 --> 39:09.256
We've had some conversations where
she's thought that my son hated her.

39:09.257 --> 39:11.892
And she seemed a little jealous...

39:11.893 --> 39:14.443
- Hmm...
- Of the kids being here.

39:14.444 --> 39:16.071
Makes a lot of sense.

39:16.072 --> 39:18.638
Now, do you remember
feeling this jealousy?

39:18.639 --> 39:22.456
Oh, yeah. When they're here,
all his time goes to them.

39:22.457 --> 39:25.711
When they're here, I split my time as
best I can between all three of them.

39:25.712 --> 39:27.854
- Mm-hmm.
- But she never sees it that way.

39:27.855 --> 39:32.895
- Now, is that the girl doing it to her?
- Yes.

39:34.407 --> 39:39.056
Obviously, this is a lot
to absorb in one night.

39:39.057 --> 39:42.140
The big question... is it
safe for you guys to live here?

39:42.141 --> 39:44.445
Is it safe for the kids to come here?

39:44.446 --> 39:46.447
And will you be able to get better?

39:46.448 --> 39:51.907
I can't answer that, but I'll turn it over
to Amy, my partner, and see if she can.

39:51.908 --> 39:57.808
There's obviously some things that need
to be done to protect everybody involved.

39:58.127 --> 40:04.027
Some of these things initially might
sound a little bit unusual and extreme.

40:04.900 --> 40:06.820
Okay.

40:06.915 --> 40:12.154
One of the things that I would suggest at
this point is to go through your bedroom

40:12.155 --> 40:16.355
and make it like a child-proof room.

40:16.987 --> 40:22.887
And Mike needs to sleep right outside
your room, and this is just to protect you.

40:23.467 --> 40:28.656
So, why is it so important that
he not sleep in there with me?

40:28.657 --> 40:33.962
Well, I don't want anybody in
this situation to be harmed.

40:33.963 --> 40:38.403
And at this point, she could harm you...

40:39.395 --> 40:43.235
Or she could harm somebody else.

40:45.076 --> 40:50.976
The next thing that needs to be done
is that there has to be an exorcism.

40:53.432 --> 40:54.196
Really?

40:54.197 --> 40:56.484
That's the only way you're
gonna get rid of her.

40:56.485 --> 40:58.705
Oh, geez.

41:00.856 --> 41:04.114
- That was our nightmare scenario.
- Mm-hmm.

41:04.115 --> 41:07.799
Now, why an exorcism instead
of trying to move somebody on?

41:07.800 --> 41:09.764
She's just beyond repair.

41:09.765 --> 41:12.672
She's done many, many, many bad things.

41:12.673 --> 41:14.085
She needs to be straightened out.

41:14.086 --> 41:19.666
Right. I would just go to
the church and ask for help.

41:23.507 --> 41:28.538
Look me in the eye and tell
me you're gonna do this.

41:28.539 --> 41:30.737
I'm gonna do it.

41:30.738 --> 41:34.583
My own life has already
been taken from me.

41:34.584 --> 41:39.313
And I don't want any more harm
to come to me or anyone else.

41:39.314 --> 41:41.133
Mm-hmm.

41:41.134 --> 41:44.014
Thank you so much.

41:46.501 --> 41:48.938
I really hope Amanda
and Mike follow my advice

41:48.939 --> 41:53.041
and rid their home of the little
girl that's tormenting them.

41:53.042 --> 41:54.788
Once she's gone,

41:54.789 --> 41:57.980
I believe all the negativity
surrounding this family should vanish.

41:57.981 --> 42:00.657
And they can live a peaceful life.
