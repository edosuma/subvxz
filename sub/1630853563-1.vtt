WEBVTT

01:12.083 --> 01:14.500
Oh.

01:55.625 --> 01:57.250
Show me the tummy!

01:58.833 --> 02:00.458
-Good boy, Pugsley!

02:03.000 --> 02:05.125
Come on, boy. Let's go.

02:10.208 --> 02:12.625
<i>Oh, it's Grandpa!</i>

02:12.708 --> 02:14.708
<i>Is he dead?</i>

02:14.791 --> 02:17.625
<i>No, miss, he's just… frozen.</i>

02:17.708 --> 02:20.041
<i>At his own birthday party too.</i>

02:20.125 --> 02:22.458
-"His big special day."
-<i>His big special day.</i>

02:22.541 --> 02:25.125
<i>And he seemed</i>
<i>so happy in the photographs.</i>

02:25.208 --> 02:26.541
<i>Wait, that's it.</i>

02:26.625 --> 02:29.708
<i>Photographs capture</i>
<i>the soul of the subject.</i>

02:29.791 --> 02:32.875
<i>The only question is,</i>
<i>how are we gonna get Grandpa…</i>

02:32.958 --> 02:35.375
<i>-…back in Grandpa!</i>

02:37.125 --> 02:38.583
Mmm.

02:38.666 --> 02:41.916
Okay, Mom.
Ask me what my biggest weakness is.

02:42.000 --> 02:42.958
Oily skin?

02:43.041 --> 02:44.125
I'm serious.

02:44.208 --> 02:48.083
I was gonna go with something
like "paralyzing fear of confrontation."

02:48.166 --> 02:51.000
Uh, sweetie, why do you wanna
know your biggest weakness?

02:51.083 --> 02:53.416
My job interview at Phoenix Parks.

02:53.500 --> 02:55.750
Tonight. I told you.

02:55.833 --> 02:59.958
Uh, but Grammy Gram's coming for dinner.
I made cheese-less mac and cheese.

03:00.041 --> 03:02.208
Ugh, Mom,
did you tell her I would be there?

03:02.291 --> 03:03.666
Yeah, of course.

03:04.333 --> 03:06.500
Did you tell her Barney would be there?

03:07.166 --> 03:10.541
Oh, come on, sweetie,
there's a lot she doesn't understand.

03:10.625 --> 03:12.375
She's not the only one.

03:19.791 --> 03:23.125
-Sorry, buddy, you can't come.

03:23.208 --> 03:25.708
But if I get this job,
we can get a place of our own.

03:25.791 --> 03:29.416
Just you and me. No Mom,
no Dad, no Grammy Gram.

03:31.958 --> 03:34.041
Okay, fine. Come on.

03:37.083 --> 03:40.250
Oh, stop it.

03:42.666 --> 03:44.583
Oh, my precious girl!

03:44.666 --> 03:46.875
Going to her first job interview!

03:46.958 --> 03:49.166
-Mom!

03:49.250 --> 03:51.000
Call me before you go in.

03:51.083 --> 03:53.875
And after. And maybe during too?

03:53.958 --> 03:55.208
Bye, Mom.

03:58.666 --> 04:00.750
<i>Just checking</i>
<i>you've got your phone.</i>

04:14.458 --> 04:15.916
If you whizz in my bag again,

04:16.000 --> 04:17.875
I'm sending you
right back home, young man.

04:17.958 --> 04:21.916
Oh, jeez.
Strange dude. Talking to himself.

04:22.541 --> 04:25.166
Okay, maybe Mom was right
and I should never go outside.

04:25.250 --> 04:27.875
Or at least I think
that's what she was trying to say.

04:27.958 --> 04:30.250
Uh… You're the one
talking to yourself, Norma.

04:30.333 --> 04:32.291
How do you know my name?

04:32.375 --> 04:34.875
-Whoa! It's me, Barney.
-Uh, I'm bad with names.

04:34.958 --> 04:38.541
We literally live on the same street.
Same school. We're lab partners!

04:38.625 --> 04:41.083
I'm bad with… faces.

04:41.166 --> 04:43.333
-Shh!

04:43.416 --> 04:46.250
<i>Hello, I'm Pauline Phoenix.</i>

04:46.333 --> 04:51.958
<i>You know, in just a few ticks,</i>
<i>we'll be at my very own theme park.</i>

04:52.041 --> 04:56.666
<i>Thank you. Where the fun just never stops,</i>
<i>except November through to March.</i>

04:56.750 --> 05:02.875
<i>We've got five zones for you all to enjoy,</i>
<i>based on my movies, music and TV shows.</i>

05:02.958 --> 05:07.541
<i>Remember, consuming outside</i>
<i>food and drink is a big no-no.</i>

05:07.625 --> 05:10.416
<i>And if you see anything</i>
<i>that seems just a little outta sorts,</i>

05:10.500 --> 05:13.500
<i>you know, anything suspicious</i>
<i>or supernatural at all,</i>

05:13.583 --> 05:16.291
<i>well,</i>
<i>just keep it to yourself, darlin'.</i>

05:20.875 --> 05:23.208
-Did you see that?
-Yeah, we're almost there.

05:32.125 --> 05:34.583
<i>Thank you for visiting Phoenix Parks.</i>

05:34.666 --> 05:37.500
-<i>Y'all enjoy yourselves!</i>

05:37.583 --> 05:38.750
<i>Or else.</i>

05:38.833 --> 05:40.458
<i>I hope y'all come back soon.</i>

05:41.250 --> 05:46.416
<i>Safe trip. Take care now.</i>
<i>Don't sue.</i>

05:50.791 --> 05:53.375
Okay, you can stop
following me now, creep.

05:53.458 --> 05:55.875
I'm not following you.
And I'm not a creep.

05:55.958 --> 05:58.458
-I've got a job interview down here.
-Wait.

05:59.625 --> 06:02.541
"Opportunity at Phoenix Parks,
Dead End Attraction."

06:02.625 --> 06:04.125
"Please arrive at sundown."

06:04.208 --> 06:07.291
"Rare opening
for the one perfect candidate."

06:08.208 --> 06:09.958
-Well, good luck.
-Thanks!

06:10.041 --> 06:11.250
Wait!

06:14.958 --> 06:15.875
Whoa!

06:17.875 --> 06:19.916
-Okay. You ready, boy?

06:20.000 --> 06:21.500
Torpe-dog!

06:23.333 --> 06:26.125
-Good boy.

06:32.833 --> 06:34.125
What?

06:35.083 --> 06:37.458
-How did that happen?
-I took the staff line.

06:38.125 --> 06:39.083
Oh.

06:50.916 --> 06:55.041
Oh, my ghosts! This is so cool.

06:55.125 --> 06:59.750
No one's been in here for a year.
Not since the Jennifer Swan incident.

06:59.833 --> 07:01.250
Jennifer Swan?

07:01.333 --> 07:03.500
It was on a night like tonight.

07:03.583 --> 07:04.833
Except it was raining.

07:04.916 --> 07:07.125
And I think
it was a Thursday morning, actually.

07:07.208 --> 07:10.708
One of the parks' Pauline
impersonators entered Dead End…

07:10.791 --> 07:13.125
-…and never came out!

07:13.208 --> 07:15.791
She died? In here?

07:15.875 --> 07:18.458
Whoa! No, I just said she didn't come out.

07:18.541 --> 07:20.791
She just "disappeared."

07:20.875 --> 07:22.666
-I can't believe you didn't know.

07:22.750 --> 07:24.208
All right.

07:26.916 --> 07:28.458
Don't you know anything about Dead End?

07:28.541 --> 07:30.500
I'm clearly
the better candidate for this job.

07:30.583 --> 07:34.208
That stuff doesn't matter.
It's about being a responsible employee.

07:34.291 --> 07:35.833
Your dog is whizzing on the furniture.

07:35.916 --> 07:38.666
Pugs… Pugsley! No!

07:38.750 --> 07:40.916
Go on. Ask me anything.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.541
Uh, how do you get dog pee out of cobwebs?

07:43.625 --> 07:46.833
About Pauline! Dead End. This park.

07:46.916 --> 07:49.375
I know everything.
Every cast member. Every episode.

07:49.458 --> 07:52.250
Every single nut and bolt
of this whole darn attraction.

07:52.333 --> 07:53.416
Who's that?

07:54.791 --> 07:57.125
Easy,
that's old Charlie Bonaparte.

07:57.208 --> 07:58.416
-Full name Charles…

07:58.500 --> 08:00.000
Welcome, mortals.

08:03.208 --> 08:07.375
-…and grandfather once removed to…

08:09.458 --> 08:12.958
<i>Your beautiful</i>
<i>photograph is ready to collect.</i>

08:13.041 --> 08:15.916
…at the full moon.
AKA, he's a werewolf.

08:17.083 --> 08:19.916
Although, they didn't establish that…
Are you even listening?

08:21.208 --> 08:24.583
Sitting around on the job?
Glad I'm not his boss.

08:24.666 --> 08:27.958
Oh, hi. I'm Norma Khan.
I'm here for the job opportunity…

08:28.041 --> 08:29.541
Hi. And I'm Barney.

08:29.625 --> 08:32.208
And you must be the manager.
Love the costume.

08:32.291 --> 08:36.750
And you two must be the offerings.
I didn't know there'd be a choice.

08:36.833 --> 08:39.541
There isn't.
Uh, here's my resume, references…

08:40.541 --> 08:41.875
…and proof of visits to Dead End…

08:41.958 --> 08:43.583
-…ages seven through 15.

08:43.666 --> 08:45.166
And if that doesn't convince you,

08:45.250 --> 08:47.916
take a look at this letter
from the very desk of Pauline's

08:48.000 --> 08:50.083
secretary's intern.

08:50.833 --> 08:53.375
-Who's Pauline Phoenix?

08:53.458 --> 08:55.875
And what about you, freckles?

08:55.958 --> 08:59.041
What makes you think
you'd be a good flesh vessel?

08:59.125 --> 09:00.375
Mmm, flesh?

09:00.458 --> 09:01.625
Perfect. Let's go.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.791
What? Uh, no fair!

09:05.333 --> 09:09.250
All right, folks, get ready.
He's on his way.

09:12.291 --> 09:15.291
-Uh…

09:30.791 --> 09:34.416
Um, Norma?
I don't think this is what we think it is.

09:34.500 --> 09:37.375
Ugh! I know! Group interview.

09:37.458 --> 09:39.000
They could've warned us.

09:39.083 --> 09:41.625
Uh, excuse me!
Does this job have any benefits?

09:41.708 --> 09:45.291
Uh, wings,
blood made of fire, immortality.

09:45.375 --> 09:48.083
-Okay, but what about dental?

09:51.916 --> 09:55.041
-Norma? Norma!
-Excuse me? I'm talking to you.

09:55.125 --> 09:56.791
-You haven't answered my question.
-Look!

09:56.875 --> 09:58.083
Do you mind?

09:58.166 --> 10:04.166
Here he comes! The demon king's
gonna love me for bringing two humans.

10:04.250 --> 10:05.958
Demon king? What episode was that in?

10:06.041 --> 10:06.916
This one!

10:22.458 --> 10:26.625
O great Temeluchus.
It must be Two for Tuesday!

10:26.708 --> 10:30.208
I got you not one,
but two flesh vessels.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.833
I rescind my application. The job's yours!

10:47.625 --> 10:51.000
They'd both make excellent
new bodies, Temeluchus.

10:51.083 --> 10:54.041
-Which shall it be?

10:55.000 --> 10:58.416
Ip dip doo, the dog's got the flu,

10:58.500 --> 11:02.458
the cat's got the chicken pox,
so it's gonna be you!

11:02.541 --> 11:03.833
Good choice. Fleshy.

11:31.166 --> 11:33.208
Pugsley!

11:44.875 --> 11:49.875
Fellow demons,
let us join hands, claws, tentacles.

12:05.125 --> 12:06.208
Pugsley?

12:07.625 --> 12:08.916
Oh, no! Pugsley!

12:09.000 --> 12:13.291
Pugsley, come on, buddy!
Open your eyes. Pugsley, please.

12:13.375 --> 12:17.250
Do not give orders
to the great Temeluchus!

12:18.333 --> 12:22.208
Tremble, for Temeluchus lives again.

12:25.625 --> 12:29.041
-Oh!

12:38.458 --> 12:40.625
I specifically requested no photographs.

12:40.708 --> 12:42.708
Yeah. Uh, sorry about that.

12:42.791 --> 12:44.083
But, uh, I was wondering,

12:44.166 --> 12:48.458
since I provided two excellent vessels
and fulfilled my side of the bargain,

12:48.541 --> 12:51.458
you could lift my curse
and let me go back home?

12:51.541 --> 12:53.458
Hmm. No!

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
I was specific.

12:57.083 --> 13:00.125
Humans, tell me.
Who is the king of this realm?

13:00.208 --> 13:03.625
-We don't have a king.
-Your ruler. Your commander.

13:03.708 --> 13:07.000
I would very much like to eat them.

13:07.083 --> 13:10.125
Oh, well, there's a little White House
about 2,000 miles that way.

13:10.208 --> 13:14.000
Enough! I shall find
and claim my own throne.

13:16.208 --> 13:18.666
Oh, no. Wait, sire.
Wait, sire! Sire, wait.

13:18.750 --> 13:22.375
Ooh, what about me, please? What about me?

13:23.541 --> 13:25.833
I just wanna go home.

13:28.875 --> 13:31.625
Norma, who are you calling? The dog pound?

13:31.708 --> 13:33.750
No, my mom. She can take us home.

13:34.666 --> 13:39.500
My dog is possessed
by Temeluka… Teme…Temeloo…

13:39.583 --> 13:42.375
-Uh, a demon!
-Yeah. It possessed your dog, not us.

13:42.458 --> 13:45.375
-So let's escape while we still can.

13:45.458 --> 13:48.208
Pugsley's not just my dog. He's my family.

13:48.291 --> 13:50.750
The only family that's always had my back.

13:50.833 --> 13:52.583
And I can't lose him.

13:52.666 --> 13:56.041
<i>Sweetie,</i>
<i>how did it go? Did you get it?</i>

13:56.125 --> 13:59.583
<i>-Oh, no, you didn't get it, did you?</i>
-Pugsley! Pugsley!

13:59.666 --> 14:02.250
<i>Did you want me to come</i>
<i>and have a word with them, maybe?</i>

14:02.333 --> 14:04.833
<i>-I will, my little blossom--</i>
-Hmm.

14:04.916 --> 14:06.583
What would Pauline do?

14:06.666 --> 14:11.125
She'd save the dog
and the park from any potential lawsuits.

14:11.750 --> 14:14.458
-You!
-Hi, hello. Yeah, Courtney. How ya doin'?

14:14.541 --> 14:15.458
How do we stop it?

14:16.208 --> 14:19.125
You can't stop Temeluchus.
He's already dead.

14:19.208 --> 14:22.458
Which is why he needs
a new vessel every few hundred years.

14:22.541 --> 14:25.625
So what are we talking?
Salt circle? Holy water? Vacuum cleaner?

14:25.708 --> 14:28.125
Ugh! Well, I did the sealing spell.

14:28.208 --> 14:31.208
Temeluchus' soul
is now in that dog for good.

14:31.291 --> 14:33.708
The only way
to stop him is to kill the dog!

14:34.375 --> 14:35.916
That's not gonna happen.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.208
Or find some
other vessel for him to possess.

14:38.291 --> 14:40.958
But the first option is way more fun.

14:41.041 --> 14:43.458
-Ugh…

14:54.208 --> 14:56.166
I specifically requested no photographs.

14:56.250 --> 14:59.791
Photographs capture the soul
of the subject.

15:02.625 --> 15:04.458
Pugsley!

15:04.541 --> 15:06.041
Pugs?

15:07.541 --> 15:08.625
Throne.

15:08.708 --> 15:12.791
He's looking for a throne!
Yes! To Camelot!

15:21.000 --> 15:22.041
There you are!

15:22.125 --> 15:24.625
Have you come to challenge me?

15:25.208 --> 15:27.708
No, I don't wanna fight you, Pugsley.

15:27.791 --> 15:31.708
Stop calling me that.
Kneel before Temeluchus!

15:33.416 --> 15:37.791
There's a good boy. You know,
your body was my first choice.

15:37.875 --> 15:40.500
Perhaps once I've exhausted
this mighty vessel,

15:40.583 --> 15:44.375
I'll move on
to your strangely unwrinkled form.

15:44.458 --> 15:46.708
I've had many bodies over the years.

15:46.791 --> 15:49.541
-This isn't even my first canine…
-Psst. You need to take a photo.

15:49.625 --> 15:51.375
Yeah, Norma,
I think I'll remember this moment.

15:51.458 --> 15:53.791
My parents met during the Haunted Wars…

15:53.875 --> 15:58.083
No! Photos capture the soul.
You know, like in Episode 105,

15:58.166 --> 16:00.958
in which Pauline finds the body
of her grandfather petrified on the floor

16:01.041 --> 16:02.416
-after his birthday party.
-Yeah, I get it.

16:02.500 --> 16:03.708
Just take the photo.

16:03.791 --> 16:06.166
But my mom says
my phone is for emergencies only.

16:06.250 --> 16:08.250
-What do you call this?
-Okay, okay.

16:08.333 --> 16:11.250
-Say cheese!

16:11.333 --> 16:12.791
-No, no, no, no, no.

16:12.875 --> 16:13.916
Huh?

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
No photos!

16:20.291 --> 16:24.125
This is what I think
of your pathetic toys.

16:24.208 --> 16:26.791
Yeah? Well, I was due an upgrade anyway!

16:27.875 --> 16:30.916
Fool.
You think you can outsmart me?

16:31.000 --> 16:34.416
Now it is your turn
to be crushed to pieces!

16:34.500 --> 16:36.708
-Huh?

16:38.916 --> 16:40.625
Quick! Get in the log!

16:44.125 --> 16:46.625
If you want me, come and get me!

17:03.375 --> 17:05.291
Norma! Help!

17:05.375 --> 17:08.125
I've got a plan! Just keep him busy
till we get to the drop!

17:09.375 --> 17:11.083
Oh, don't worry, he's busy!

17:15.833 --> 17:17.875
Nice try.

17:21.625 --> 17:22.500
Get down!

17:22.583 --> 17:24.041
Huh?

17:25.625 --> 17:26.458
Wow.

17:26.541 --> 17:29.166
Pugsley's fighting back
from the inside.

17:30.291 --> 17:33.750
What did you just do to me?
Some tricksy spell?

17:33.833 --> 17:35.083
Pugsley, sit!

17:36.541 --> 17:37.416
Huh.

17:37.500 --> 17:40.375
Witches? I knew it!

17:41.583 --> 17:42.666
Doggie!

17:42.750 --> 17:43.833
-Huh?
-Fetch!

17:45.458 --> 17:47.166
-Ha-ha!

17:47.250 --> 17:50.208
I know your plan!

17:50.291 --> 17:51.541
-And it won't work!

17:59.500 --> 18:01.000
Norma!

18:13.333 --> 18:15.291
Huh?

18:21.166 --> 18:22.416
Huh?

18:25.791 --> 18:28.291
Ha-ha!

18:29.666 --> 18:31.625
Any last words?

18:31.708 --> 18:34.791
Show me the tummy!

18:36.375 --> 18:38.166
-Oh, no!
-Who's a good boy?

18:38.250 --> 18:40.250
-Who's a good boy?

18:41.666 --> 18:44.208
-Oh! No! No! No, no!
-Let me get that.

18:44.291 --> 18:45.166
Who's a good boy?

18:45.750 --> 18:48.291
-Come on, Norma!
-Trying!

18:48.375 --> 18:50.500
-No! No!
-That's it. Show me the tummy.

18:51.500 --> 18:55.208
-Happy puppy. Good boy. Norma. Norma, now!

18:58.375 --> 19:00.291
-No!

19:04.208 --> 19:05.125
Pugsley?

19:05.916 --> 19:08.416
Pugsley, wake up.

19:08.500 --> 19:11.916
Pugsley, wake up.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.875
Wake up.

19:14.583 --> 19:17.708
Pugsley? Pugsley! You're alive?

19:17.791 --> 19:20.750
Pugsley! Oh!

19:20.833 --> 19:23.666
Thank you, Norma.
You didn't have to help us.

19:23.750 --> 19:26.041
Oh, no. I did it for Pauline.

19:26.125 --> 19:29.458
<i>Your beautiful</i>
<i>photograph is ready to collect.</i>

19:30.416 --> 19:33.625
-Don't worry, buddy. It's all over now.

19:33.708 --> 19:35.750
There's still one more thing for us to do.

19:38.416 --> 19:40.208
Ugh! Let me in!

19:40.291 --> 19:41.250
-Huh?

19:42.250 --> 19:47.125
Wait. You guys are alive?
What happened to Temeluchus?

19:48.416 --> 19:49.958
Oh, he had a great time in the park.

19:50.041 --> 19:51.791
And made lots of memories.

19:57.083 --> 20:01.416
How am I ever gonna
get myself un-banished now?

20:03.250 --> 20:07.958
You know, I'm glad we're alive
but, uh, I still really wanted that job.

20:08.041 --> 20:10.000
Yeah, me too. Guess I'll just spend

20:10.083 --> 20:12.416
another 15 years hyper-fixating
on something else.

20:12.500 --> 20:15.041
Wait, wait! Wait! Humans.

20:15.125 --> 20:16.583
What do you want now?

20:16.666 --> 20:18.541
Don't you wanna know who got the job?

20:18.625 --> 20:20.666
You tricked us. There is no job.

20:20.750 --> 20:23.416
In this place,
there's always a job going.

20:23.500 --> 20:27.833
I tend to scare away most security guards.
Put these on and you'll blend right in.

20:30.250 --> 20:33.083
You guys are like
demon-buster extraordinaires.

20:33.166 --> 20:34.416
I need you guys around.

20:34.500 --> 20:37.041
Wouldn't we be the last people
you'd want hanging around?

20:37.125 --> 20:41.333
Not all demons are as friendly
and forgiving as I am.

20:41.416 --> 20:43.208
After what happened today,

20:43.291 --> 20:45.916
I feel I'm gonna need
a lot of security around.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.666
So what do you say?

20:48.500 --> 20:50.958
-Well, to be honest…
-I got the job!

20:51.041 --> 20:52.666
-I got it!

20:52.750 --> 20:54.500
<i>I'll be right over to pick you up!</i>

20:54.583 --> 20:56.166
<i>-There's going to be a big party tonight.</i>
-Psst. Norma.

20:56.250 --> 20:58.000
-Ma, wait. See you in a minute.
<i>-Oh, I'm so--</i>

20:58.083 --> 20:59.708
Do you think we can trust her?

20:59.791 --> 21:02.375
Hmm. Well, she is a demon.

21:02.458 --> 21:04.416
I try not to judge people on appearance.

21:04.500 --> 21:06.333
And she did try to sacrifice us.

21:06.416 --> 21:09.750
Or experience.
Or deep-seated gut instincts.

21:10.833 --> 21:13.791
Anyhow, Mom's coming to pick me up
for celebration tacos.

21:13.875 --> 21:17.208
Uh, wanna come with me, Barney?

21:17.291 --> 21:19.083
Hey! You remembered my name.

21:19.166 --> 21:22.458
Don't make it weird.
Uh, so what do you say?

21:22.541 --> 21:24.500
My whole family's going out
for dinner.

21:24.583 --> 21:27.250
Even my grandma. Uh, wanna come?

21:28.625 --> 21:31.458
Well, I'm gonna stick around here
for just a little bit.

21:32.541 --> 21:35.041
Maybe get a shift in right away.
For the overtime.

21:35.125 --> 21:37.000
-You have fun, partner.

21:45.875 --> 21:47.791
Don't suppose this place has any bedrooms?

22:00.708 --> 22:01.750
Whoa!

22:08.833 --> 22:09.666
Whoa!

22:25.500 --> 22:29.500
So, my liege…

22:29.583 --> 22:33.416
Sorry about that. No, uh…
No hard feelings.

22:34.500 --> 22:37.083
Hmm. There's a bit of you missing.

22:38.125 --> 22:39.458
Where did that go?

22:42.000 --> 22:44.833
Ah, it's perfect.
For tonight, at least.

22:46.583 --> 22:50.666
Oh, how thoughtless of me. Here you go.

22:54.000 --> 22:58.416
Ah! A place of our own. Just like I said.

22:58.500 --> 23:01.083
Night-night, Pugsley.

23:02.500 --> 23:03.625
Night-night, Barney.
