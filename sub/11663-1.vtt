(mellow music playing)

01:08.367 --> 01:11.400
What do you think, Blanche,
am I through with my cycle?

01:11.467 --> 01:14.166
I'd say menopause is a pretty good guess.

01:15.867 --> 01:18.533
You're about as puffy
as the Pillsbury Doughboy.

01:20.200 --> 01:23.667
-I was talking about my exercycle.
-Oh.

01:25.266 --> 01:29.100
It's so hard to know what to leave here
and what to put in storage.

01:29.700 --> 01:30.967
What are you doing, Rose?

01:31.033 --> 01:34.900
I was just going through the change.
Well, that explains the puffiness.

01:37.100 --> 01:41.133
All right, that's it.
I'm sick of this. I am not puffy.

01:41.200 --> 01:44.900
There's no similarity between me
and the Pillsbury Doughboy.

01:44.967 --> 01:47.467
Understand? None. Hee hee!

01:50.900 --> 01:53.233
I'll start loading the car.

01:53.300 --> 01:56.300
Don't take that.
I'm keeping that pile here.

01:56.367 --> 01:59.166
-All of this?
-I can't part with those things.

01:59.233 --> 02:00.967
They're all special to me.

02:01.000 --> 02:06.200
-What's so special about this?
-Oh, look, my bullhorn!

02:06.266 --> 02:10.734
This is all I have left from my one day
as a mountain Rangerette.

02:12.033 --> 02:13.233
Hey, you!

02:13.300 --> 02:16.166
Get out of the pass!
This is avalanche country.

02:18.200 --> 02:20.266
You still want this old camera?

02:20.333 --> 02:23.533
Where did you find that?
That was Charlie's camera.

02:23.600 --> 02:26.200
And... it still has film in it.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.467
Oh, I'll bet these are the pictures
from Charlie's last birthday.

02:30.800 --> 02:32.333
I took most of our savings

02:32.400 --> 02:36.633
and bought him some of the most beautiful
land in Minnesota.

02:37.066 --> 02:41.000
You should have seen the look on his face
when it was delivered.

02:46.834 --> 02:49.300
I'll drop the film off

02:49.367 --> 02:52.166
when I pick up our tickets
to the philharmonic today.

02:52.233 --> 02:57.200
-Philharmonic?
-Yep. Beethoven's <i>Sonata No. 29</i>.

02:57.266 --> 03:00.767
One week from tonight,
just you and me under the stars.

03:00.834 --> 03:03.567
-Ma, aren't you excited?
-I'm lactating.

03:05.033 --> 03:06.300
Ma!

03:06.367 --> 03:09.000
I forgot this. I don't want to go.
Please.

03:09.066 --> 03:11.900
You always loved it when we did things
together.

03:11.967 --> 03:13.200
Why the sudden change?

03:13.266 --> 03:16.066
Don't ask me. Rose is the one
going through the change.

03:16.800 --> 03:19.000
Well, that would explain the puffiness.

03:21.233 --> 03:24.166
-I need some coffee.
-I'd love a cup, Sophia.

03:24.233 --> 03:26.667
-Me, too.
-Make the oldest tribe member

03:26.734 --> 03:27.734
serve the young.

03:27.800 --> 03:31.100
After you're done, I'll go to the
mountaintop and let the wolves eat me.

03:33.066 --> 03:35.867
-I'm worried about Ma.
-Why? What do you mean?

03:35.934 --> 03:40.734
I picked up this pamphlet on the four
warning signs of hearing loss.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.767
-I think Ma may be having a problem.
-Sophia?

03:43.834 --> 03:49.100
Warning sign number 1,
avoidance of social activities.

03:49.633 --> 03:53.633
Number 2, people who
can't hear act forgetful.

03:54.100 --> 03:57.700
-Ma forgot about these tickets.
-Oh, that was just an excuse.

03:57.767 --> 04:00.300
Sophia's not really getting forgetful.

04:00.367 --> 04:02.433
Hot coffee coming through.

04:06.633 --> 04:09.166
Number 3, they act cranky.

04:09.667 --> 04:11.467
Ah, the hell with you.
Get your own coffee.

04:13.066 --> 04:16.266
And number 4,
they usually laugh out of context.

04:18.667 --> 04:20.133
Why are you laughing?

04:20.200 --> 04:23.467
I thought you said,
"My dog has no nose."

04:23.533 --> 04:26.300
"Well, how does he smell?" "Awful."

04:28.900 --> 04:29.967
Awful.

04:33.066 --> 04:34.133
Nothing, huh?

04:34.200 --> 04:36.066
I laughed when I thought you said it.

04:37.433 --> 04:41.133
(serene music playing)

04:41.200 --> 04:43.467
Hi, Ma. How are you?

04:47.066 --> 04:49.700
Are you happy today?

04:50.367 --> 04:53.767
Oh, my God. We're being bugged.
Who is it? Immigration?

04:54.467 --> 04:59.667
-Ma, what are you talking about?
-Ah, happy? I'm...

05:00.467 --> 05:01.867
I'm happy, all right.

05:01.934 --> 05:04.867
Happy to be a citizen of
the United States of America.

05:05.433 --> 05:07.700
Ma, you are a citizen.

05:07.767 --> 05:11.233
That's right, Dorothy.
As far as we know, I am a citizen.

05:11.300 --> 05:13.734
A citizen of the US of A.

05:15.000 --> 05:20.700
Home of presidents like Ford, Lincoln...
help me out here, Dorothy.

05:20.767 --> 05:23.467
-Bush, Ma.
-Oh. And Regan.

05:25.200 --> 05:28.400
Ma, I'm sorry to interrupt this
flag-waving,

05:28.467 --> 05:33.800
psychotic tribute to our country,
but I think you need a hearing aid.

05:33.867 --> 05:36.100
Oh, please. I have the hearing
of a Springer Spaniel.

05:36.166 --> 05:39.500
Look. Ma, I am concerned.
You're my mother.

05:39.567 --> 05:41.867
Can't you just check it out? Please?

05:44.600 --> 05:46.000
What are you laughing at?

05:46.066 --> 05:50.800
I'm sorry, I thought you said
"I'm Mothra. Giant radioactive insect."

05:53.800 --> 05:57.367
-I didn't, Ma.
-Too bad. It was a good impression.

05:58.400 --> 05:59.567
Ma...

06:00.300 --> 06:04.233
Come on, Dorothy, I'm kidding.
I read that flyer you brought home.

06:04.300 --> 06:07.500
Every time you get a pamphlet,
I get that disease.

06:07.567 --> 06:08.867
And not just diseases.

06:08.934 --> 06:11.233
I thought for a while
I was a Jew for Jesus.

06:14.967 --> 06:16.834
-Hi, Sophia.
-Shalom.

06:18.166 --> 06:20.500
I picked up Charlie's pictures.

06:22.533 --> 06:25.967
Oh, these must be
from his last trip to Florida.

06:26.033 --> 06:28.533
He went there every spring
to discuss sales.

06:28.600 --> 06:31.767
Aw, look, here he is at gator world...

06:32.300 --> 06:35.033
and here he is touring
the Miami suburbs...

06:35.667 --> 06:38.200
and here he is in Blanche's bed...

06:38.633 --> 06:40.200
-And here--
-Wait!

06:40.266 --> 06:43.567
-Blanche? Blanche Devereaux?
-Yeah, right here in her bed.

06:45.367 --> 06:46.533
Oh, no!

06:48.100 --> 06:49.300
No!

06:49.367 --> 06:52.800
Don't tell me he met Blanche
and slept with her.

06:52.867 --> 06:55.734
Now, wait. I'm sure he didn't sleep
with Blanche.

06:55.800 --> 06:57.000
How about this picture?

06:57.066 --> 07:00.433
Just because a man is in Blanche's bed
doesn't mean...

07:01.033 --> 07:02.967
so a guy makes one mistake.

07:03.667 --> 07:07.433
There has to be an explanation.
Honey, why don't we ask Blanche?

07:07.500 --> 07:10.000
Oh, I can't talk to Blanche. I...

07:10.066 --> 07:12.533
when I'm upset,
everything comes out wrong.

07:12.600 --> 07:15.000
Face it, Dorothy,
I don't have your quick wit...

07:15.500 --> 07:19.233
your conversation skills,
your way with... with...

07:19.767 --> 07:22.500
-Words?
-Words. Thank you.

07:23.367 --> 07:25.433
I'd probably call her a slut.

07:25.500 --> 07:29.100
Oh, come on.
Honey, slut is a little harsh.

07:29.166 --> 07:35.133
-Blanche isn't that bad.
-Oh, my God. I can barely walk.

07:37.266 --> 07:41.133
Although "slut" does have a documentary
feel to it.

07:42.400 --> 07:45.133
You... you... Harlot!

07:45.600 --> 07:49.800
Oh, Rose, I'm sore because
I was using your exercycle.

07:50.233 --> 07:52.100
I'm talking about this picture.

07:52.734 --> 07:53.967
Oh, my God.

07:54.533 --> 07:58.133
Where did you find this?
Oh, I'm so embarrassed.

07:58.200 --> 08:00.900
(gasps) My hair, it looks like a helmet.

08:02.233 --> 08:05.033
-Blanche!
-It's all bunched up and pointy.

08:05.100 --> 08:07.900
You've got to burn this.
I look like <i>The Rocketeer</i>.

08:08.633 --> 08:13.567
Blanche, forget about your hair.
That is Rose's husband with you.

08:14.133 --> 08:15.400
Who, Charlie?

08:15.667 --> 08:17.734
No, I never met Charlie.

08:17.800 --> 08:22.200
You not only met him, you slept with him,
just like you sleep with everybody.

08:22.266 --> 08:23.867
I most certainly do not.

08:23.934 --> 08:27.567
Oh, come on, Blanche.
You've landed on your back more than...

08:28.066 --> 08:29.233
more than...

08:29.900 --> 08:31.867
<i>The American Gladiators</i>.

08:34.166 --> 08:35.166
Oh!

08:36.333 --> 08:38.500
You just watch your mouth, Rose.

08:38.567 --> 08:42.133
I may be a social person,
but I'm certainly discerning.

08:42.200 --> 08:46.066
Discerning? Blanche, you've been
under more drunken sailors than...

08:46.433 --> 08:50.066
-than...
-Oh, now, Rose, don't drag me into this.

08:51.867 --> 08:53.500
A nautical toilet.

08:59.033 --> 09:02.300
That does it, Rose.
Now you've just gone too far.

09:02.633 --> 09:04.567
I don't know how he got into my room,

09:04.633 --> 09:08.734
but I promise you, I do not sleep
with men who wear wedding bands.

09:08.800 --> 09:12.066
-What if he removed it?
-Then I'd see the tan line.

09:12.133 --> 09:15.266
What if he was from Minnesota
and had no tan?

09:16.700 --> 09:17.867
Eew.

09:19.033 --> 09:21.367
Eew? So he's not good enough for you?

09:21.767 --> 09:25.500
Listen, my Charlie was 6'2"
and broad-shouldered

09:25.567 --> 09:29.066
and... apparently had about
as much taste in women

09:29.133 --> 09:31.367
as... as... as...

09:33.000 --> 09:37.433
other men w... with flawed
choicing skills.

09:38.467 --> 09:40.900
(calm music playing)

09:40.967 --> 09:41.967
Hi, Ma.

09:45.567 --> 09:47.333
(beeping sound)

09:48.533 --> 09:49.600
Aha.

09:50.266 --> 09:52.600
-What aha?
-You didn't hear that.

09:52.667 --> 09:56.600
Actually, I was trying to be polite,
but since you brought it up, excuse you.

09:59.467 --> 10:01.433
Ma, you didn't hear that.

10:01.500 --> 10:04.367
Now face it.
You can't hear high frequencies.

10:04.433 --> 10:06.934
Why can't you be honest
about what's happening to you?

10:07.000 --> 10:09.100
Why do you insist on becoming feeble?

10:09.667 --> 10:11.266
Feeble? Now, listen, Dorothy,

10:11.700 --> 10:14.633
I may not have your gift for word jumbles
or your ability to float...

10:15.033 --> 10:17.100
or your way of making
small children weep...

10:19.266 --> 10:20.266
But?

10:20.333 --> 10:21.700
Or your butt. Thank you.

10:26.033 --> 10:28.834
-There's one thing I do have.
-What's that, Ma?

10:28.900 --> 10:31.700
2,000 shares of Xerox,
which I bought at...

10:32.433 --> 10:34.066
my health. I've got my health.

10:35.867 --> 10:39.767
Listen, Ma, I made an appointment for you
for 2:00 this afternoon.

10:39.834 --> 10:44.567
Either go get your hearing checked,
or I will make life miserable for you.

10:44.633 --> 10:46.834
Oh, come on.
You said the exact same things

10:46.900 --> 10:48.633
before you took me to shady...

10:50.100 --> 10:51.400
I'll go pretty up.

10:54.000 --> 10:54.967
(bang)

10:56.633 --> 10:57.633
(bang)

10:59.800 --> 11:00.800
(bang)

11:02.266 --> 11:03.300
Rose?

11:06.133 --> 11:07.533
Rose...

11:08.100 --> 11:10.300
Don't talk to me.
Don't try to cheer me up.

11:10.367 --> 11:11.500
Just leave me alone.

11:11.567 --> 11:15.700
I am angry, and I'm going to stay angry.
Hee hee!

11:19.900 --> 11:21.433
Stop it!

11:22.100 --> 11:23.734
Dorothy, it just doesn't make sense.

11:23.800 --> 11:26.867
Why was Charlie with that tramp
if he didn't sleep with her?

11:26.934 --> 11:31.367
Come on. Blanche may be a little loose,
but she's not a tramp.

11:31.433 --> 11:36.233
Ok, here they are, the names of all the
men I have dated since my husband died.

11:36.300 --> 11:38.400
What do you know?
The tramp keeps records.

11:41.233 --> 11:43.266
Dorothy, most of the men in these pages

11:43.333 --> 11:46.800
just fantasized
about going to bed with me.

11:47.367 --> 11:49.200
What do the gold stars mean?

11:50.300 --> 11:52.066
I had a good time.

11:54.033 --> 11:57.767
-What do the silver stars mean?
-I ran out of gold stars.

11:59.100 --> 12:00.367
Wait a minute.

12:00.667 --> 12:03.066
If you didn't sleep with any of the men
in these journals,

12:03.133 --> 12:05.500
then how come it says "bed"
on the cover?

12:05.567 --> 12:09.200
-That doesn't say bed.
-Right there it does.

12:09.266 --> 12:14.133
Silly, those are my initials.
Blanche Elizabeth Devereaux.

12:14.667 --> 12:17.100
Your initials spell bed?

12:25.500 --> 12:28.734
Ok, let's see.
You said eight years ago, spring?

12:28.800 --> 12:30.000
That starts right here.

12:30.066 --> 12:33.200
I'm going to prove
I'm not sexually indiscriminate.

12:33.266 --> 12:35.100
Or her name isn't bed.

12:35.967 --> 12:38.633
Wait a minute! Wait a minute.

12:38.700 --> 12:42.367
It says right there
you slept with a traveling salesman.

12:42.433 --> 12:45.567
In fairness, it says that
on her license plates.

12:46.900 --> 12:52.066
Oh, my God! There. Chuck.
A traveling salesman named Chuck.

12:52.767 --> 12:54.700
Well... that must be him.

12:55.266 --> 12:56.667
Oh, my God.

12:57.266 --> 12:59.700
Oh, Rose, I'm so sorry.

13:00.233 --> 13:03.934
I did. It's right there in the diary.
I must have...

13:04.500 --> 13:07.500
I must have slept
with your husband Charlie.

13:09.700 --> 13:15.467
(calm music playing)

13:19.300 --> 13:22.400
What's the news?
How'd the hearing test come out?

13:23.734 --> 13:26.266
(loudly) Tell her what the doctor said.

13:28.100 --> 13:31.500
-Tell her what--
-Ma's fine, ok?

13:33.300 --> 13:34.300
And?

13:34.367 --> 13:36.700
I need a hearing aid, all right?

13:41.200 --> 13:43.934
I got tested to show her
there was nothing to it.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.533
Turns out I have a slight hearing loss.

13:46.600 --> 13:50.200
And get this, it's inherited,
and it skips a generation.

13:50.266 --> 13:55.133
-Skips a generation. Yahoo!
-Oh, come on.

13:56.100 --> 13:57.567
That is not true.

13:57.633 --> 13:59.433
You're just going to gloat about this,
aren't you?

13:59.500 --> 14:01.600
This is a big victory for you.

14:01.667 --> 14:05.200
I am not going to get a hearing aid.
Period.

14:05.266 --> 14:09.600
Dorothy, you're the one who's been talking
about aging with dignity.

14:09.667 --> 14:12.100
Not for me. For her.

14:13.166 --> 14:16.934
Look at her.
The woman is hundreds of years old.

14:19.033 --> 14:21.033
She should be carbon dated.

14:22.633 --> 14:23.700
If the doctor said--

14:23.767 --> 14:26.567
Look, I really don't want to hear this,
ok?

14:26.633 --> 14:28.133
Good news. You can't.

14:34.767 --> 14:37.233
Oh, Rose, Rose, what are you doing?

14:37.300 --> 14:41.066
Oh, she can't face me.
She's been doing this all day.

14:41.133 --> 14:44.734
Rose, you know I said I'm sorry.

14:45.133 --> 14:47.233
Can't you put yourself in my position?

14:50.567 --> 14:52.767
Apparently I'm not limber enough.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.633
That was good.

15:03.367 --> 15:05.533
Blanche, what happened
with you and Charlie

15:05.600 --> 15:07.033
happened before you ever knew me.

15:07.100 --> 15:11.600
I know I shouldn't be so angry, but I am,
and I can't help it.

15:11.667 --> 15:13.200
Take it easy, Rose.

15:13.266 --> 15:16.266
What do you think this makes me
feel like?

15:16.333 --> 15:17.333
What?

15:17.400 --> 15:19.734
She said, "What do you think
this makes me feel like?"

15:24.433 --> 15:25.467
It's out of the park.

15:25.767 --> 15:28.567
Game over. I'm going to Disneyland.

15:32.567 --> 15:35.567
How come she gets to go to Disneyland?

15:37.066 --> 15:38.100
Rose...

15:38.667 --> 15:41.033
Dorothy needs a hearing aid,
but she won't get one.

15:41.100 --> 15:43.300
She's afraid she'll feel old.

15:43.367 --> 15:44.367
I don't get it.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.400
When did I become my parents' age?

15:47.767 --> 15:50.433
I remember being 20 years old

15:50.500 --> 15:53.433
and worrying if I didn't
spend the holidays at home,

15:53.500 --> 15:57.467
I might never see them again.
Everything changes so suddenly.

15:58.066 --> 16:04.467
You know what's young to me now?
40. Suddenly 40 is young.

16:04.533 --> 16:06.667
Oh, aren't you sweet.

16:11.500 --> 16:13.033
Every day it's something else.

16:13.467 --> 16:18.734
-The hair gets gray, the eyes get weak...
-And you shrink. It's scary.

16:19.166 --> 16:22.266
You measure your height
against your arm span,

16:22.333 --> 16:25.734
and when they stop being equal,
you're actually getting smaller.

16:27.367 --> 16:28.400
Hey!

16:29.233 --> 16:30.367
Oh.

16:35.300 --> 16:37.467
Anyway, Dorothy,
these new hearing aids

16:37.533 --> 16:39.266
just fit right in the ear canal.

16:39.333 --> 16:41.600
Nobody can see them,
so what does it matter?

16:41.667 --> 16:45.100
It matters because
it's a step I don't want to take.

16:45.467 --> 16:49.767
I don't mind being divorced
or struggling to pay my bills

16:49.834 --> 16:52.667
or eating my weight in supplements
every morning,

16:52.734 --> 16:54.100
but I will not do this.

16:54.166 --> 16:56.233
I will not become an old person.

16:57.433 --> 16:59.200
Ooh. Rain's coming.

17:01.767 --> 17:07.133
(mellow music playing)

17:09.467 --> 17:12.567
Rose, it's the middle of September.
What are you doing?

17:12.633 --> 17:14.934
Oh, it's a banner Charlie made.

17:15.033 --> 17:18.000
It'd be nice to have good memories of him
around me.

17:18.066 --> 17:22.333
He put it up every year.
He was one of a kind, all right.

17:22.700 --> 17:24.133
Loved Christmas.

17:24.200 --> 17:26.300
Loved Christmas. That is unique.

17:28.700 --> 17:30.900
Of course, that was
before he met Blanche.

17:31.533 --> 17:34.867
Pretty, affectionate, fun-loving Blanche.

17:35.567 --> 17:37.700
Say, where is old happy pants?

17:39.767 --> 17:42.100
She and Ma went to the philharmonic.

17:42.166 --> 17:46.033
-I thought you were going to that.
-Why? It's not like I could enjoy it.

17:46.100 --> 17:47.200
True.

17:48.400 --> 17:51.867
On the other hand,
Beethoven was also deaf.

17:51.934 --> 17:54.367
So you'd be hearing the music
the way he wrote it.

18:01.500 --> 18:02.533
Look at us.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.066
You haven't been out of the house
in a week,

18:05.133 --> 18:07.500
and I've lost one of my best friends.

18:07.567 --> 18:11.066
-You haven't lost one of your best friend.
-Sure, I have.

18:11.133 --> 18:13.667
It's too painful to talk to Blanche.

18:13.734 --> 18:17.367
So I figure she can be my landlord,
but we'll stop being friends.

18:17.433 --> 18:19.533
Now, Rose, that's not
what you really want.

18:19.600 --> 18:22.834
Honey, you're sacrificing something
very important to you

18:22.900 --> 18:25.667
over a mistake that was made years ago.

18:25.734 --> 18:27.333
You know what you should do?

18:27.800 --> 18:32.600
Sit down, write down everything that you
like about Blanche.

18:32.667 --> 18:34.266
Honey, if you care for someone,

18:34.333 --> 18:37.700
it's important to remember
why they're in your life.

18:39.100 --> 18:42.600
I guess you're right.
I guess I was pretty hard on her.

18:43.300 --> 18:46.934
I can't believe I made that crack
about the nautical toilet.

18:48.433 --> 18:50.200
You lost your head.

19:03.233 --> 19:05.500
Oh, I'm having a vision.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.066
A religious vision.
Oh, God, it's so beautiful.

19:15.200 --> 19:19.200
Sophia, please. Our savior wouldn't be
caught dead in that outfit.

19:20.066 --> 19:22.333
I guess I ought to go talk to Rose.
Where is she?

19:22.400 --> 19:24.400
-In the kitchen.
-Is she still upset?

19:24.467 --> 19:26.934
-Uh-huh.
-I just don't understand it.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.767
How could I not remember Charlie?

19:29.066 --> 19:32.133
Have I finally become so jaded

19:32.200 --> 19:34.600
that I can no longer put the name
with the face?

19:35.300 --> 19:36.567
Oh, listen to me.

19:36.633 --> 19:38.834
He was probably just lousy in bed.

19:42.133 --> 19:45.800
-You missed a sensational concert tonight.
-I'm glad I didn't go tonight.

19:46.333 --> 19:49.100
Who needs the crowds, the hassle?

19:49.166 --> 19:50.900
You're sounding old, pussycat.

19:51.567 --> 19:53.500
It's not a hearing aid
that makes you old.

19:53.767 --> 19:55.433
It's what you're becoming
by not getting one.

19:55.500 --> 19:58.033
Think of what you're missing,
everything I hear,

19:58.100 --> 20:00.600
the birds singing,
the wind in the trees,

20:00.667 --> 20:02.000
the sound of the ticker tape

20:02.066 --> 20:03.934
telling you Xerox has gone up to...

20:06.166 --> 20:08.633
my health.
Did I mention I've got my health?

20:10.000 --> 20:15.100
(serene music playing)

20:17.066 --> 20:18.867
-Rose...
-Don't say anything.

20:18.934 --> 20:21.367
-I've given this a lot of thought.
-Wait, Rose--

20:21.433 --> 20:23.734
No. Listen.

20:23.800 --> 20:26.667
Charlie was the most important man
in my life...

20:27.467 --> 20:32.934
but as much as I cared about him,
I can't help but care about you, too.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.500
You're like a sister to me,
and I can't throw that away...

20:38.000 --> 20:40.567
so I forgive you...

20:41.266 --> 20:47.066
for being a moralless,
emotionally-needy man leech

20:47.133 --> 20:49.000
with an air bag in her headboard.

20:53.433 --> 20:56.400
And I'm sorry I said
you were insensitive.

20:56.900 --> 20:58.500
Apology accepted.

21:02.233 --> 21:06.100
Ok, Dorothy, hand me those pictures.
I think it's time we rip 'em up.

21:07.467 --> 21:08.667
Wait a minute, Rose.

21:09.066 --> 21:10.800
Have you seen the rest
of these pictures?

21:11.200 --> 21:14.700
-I'd rather not.
-I think there's some mistake.

21:14.767 --> 21:17.633
Look. Here's Blanche in bed
with Charlie,

21:17.700 --> 21:21.967
but... this one's Blanche in bed
with a pontoon boat.

21:22.800 --> 21:26.100
Here's Blanche in bed with the big orange
from the Sunkist building.

21:26.600 --> 21:30.667
And here's Blanche in bed
with the country bear jamboree.

21:31.834 --> 21:35.000
-Honey, do you know what this means?
-I sure do.

21:35.467 --> 21:37.333
My God, you're an animal.

21:39.400 --> 21:42.767
Rose, these are double exposures.

21:42.834 --> 21:44.166
Double exposures?

21:44.233 --> 21:47.000
Obviously Blanche took pictures
with the camera

21:47.066 --> 21:49.000
over film that was already in it.

21:49.066 --> 21:50.500
How strange.

21:50.567 --> 21:52.600
And what a great alibi for the future.

21:53.400 --> 21:57.266
What were you doing taking pictures
of yourself in bed?

21:57.333 --> 21:59.433
You've seen her Christmas cards.

22:01.600 --> 22:05.000
Well, I've got two tickets
for the final night of the philharmonic.

22:05.066 --> 22:08.600
One of them has your name on it.
Here you go, opus.

22:09.633 --> 22:13.033
I thought you two went last night.
I traded those for these.

22:13.100 --> 22:15.633
Actually, last night we went
to see <i>Dying Young.</i>

22:15.700 --> 22:18.433
Terrific. I laughed till I peed.

22:20.567 --> 22:21.867
Then I laughed at that.

22:23.266 --> 22:25.667
You mean you just pretended
to go to the concert

22:25.734 --> 22:27.533
so I'd realize what I'd been missing?

22:27.600 --> 22:29.300
How stupid I've been?

22:29.367 --> 22:32.667
-Will you get a hearing aid?
-You're too late. I already did.

22:32.734 --> 22:36.000
-I'm wearing one now.
-You got it? Wonderful.

22:36.066 --> 22:37.133
Terrific, honey.

22:37.200 --> 22:39.467
The great thing is you can't see it.

22:39.533 --> 22:41.200
Oh, you're beautiful.

22:41.266 --> 22:45.400
You've always had the elegance
of a young Lauren Bacall.

22:45.467 --> 22:47.166
Oh, thank you, Ma.

22:49.767 --> 22:51.233
A young Bacall.

22:54.734 --> 22:58.133
Amazing. 60 years old and she still falls
for that young Bacall bit.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.433
I heard that.

23:11.166 --> 23:15.867
(theme music playing)
