00:00.917 --> 00:02.127
Previously on Rosewood...

00:02.293 --> 00:04.004
Nineteen years ago
I showed up at a house

00:04.129 --> 00:06.798
looking for a father who put his hands
on his nine-year-old son,

00:07.132 --> 00:08.842
and I beat him
within an inch of his life.

00:09.092 --> 00:11.428
After you read this,
you're gonna want these.

00:11.720 --> 00:15.265
Donna Rosewood is not the humming type
unless something's gone very well.

00:15.724 --> 00:19.102
A new man would explain those long
phone calls during her lunch hour.

00:19.227 --> 00:20.311
Y'all need to stop.

00:20.603 --> 00:23.773
His name is Gerald. He's from Daytona.
That's all you're gonna get.

00:23.940 --> 00:25.025
Hi, Gerald.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.569
-What do you think?
-I'm lost.

00:27.777 --> 00:28.611
I don't believe this.

00:28.695 --> 00:30.905
Because you're the one who wanted
to push the wedding, no?

00:30.989 --> 00:33.366
I was afraid to lose you, but...

00:33.450 --> 00:34.492
It's over?

00:38.621 --> 00:40.457
-I have to tell you something.
-I think it can wait.

00:40.540 --> 00:42.333
I reached out
to the ME's office in New York,

00:42.417 --> 00:43.877
had them pull
Eddie's autopsy report.

00:43.960 --> 00:45.628
-You did what?
-I believe he was murdered.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.380
You think I missed
my own husband's murder?

00:47.464 --> 00:50.508
Get out. Leave. Go. Get out.

01:39.974 --> 01:40.892
The bus is leaving.

01:41.351 --> 01:43.853
Hey. I'm not hanging around, so...

01:43.978 --> 01:46.981
Thanks, but I just parked
a few blocks down, so you can go.

01:47.190 --> 01:48.942
You sure?
You don't look great.

01:49.317 --> 01:54.072
Well, the past two months of my life
have been pretty terrible and...

01:55.240 --> 01:56.074
I...

01:56.157 --> 01:59.327
You know, I could meet you later.
I'm a good listener.

01:59.577 --> 02:00.787
You don't have to worry about me.

02:01.329 --> 02:02.288
Have a good night.

02:19.639 --> 02:21.141
It's gonna be okay.

02:57.677 --> 03:00.597
Be a part of the love club

03:00.680 --> 03:03.933
Everything will glow for you

03:07.770 --> 03:10.899
You'll get punched for the love club

03:10.982 --> 03:14.152
Everything will glow for you

03:17.989 --> 03:21.409
You'll get punched for the love club

03:21.784 --> 03:24.037
For the love club

03:38.218 --> 03:39.802
Wow, Pip, wow!

03:39.886 --> 03:41.512
See how big a smile
you put on my face?

03:41.638 --> 03:42.764
You're always smiling.

03:42.931 --> 03:44.307
True, but see how big this one is.

03:44.390 --> 03:46.351
Yeah, it's like cartoon huge.

03:46.643 --> 03:47.685
Yeah, and you know why?

03:47.769 --> 03:50.772
'Cause my baby sister's
just got this place turned up tonight!

03:51.481 --> 03:53.107
You know, you brought me
to a happy place.

03:53.191 --> 03:55.818
I bought real estate there,
put up a fence, had a pool--

03:55.902 --> 03:57.362
No, enough, stop. I get it.

03:58.029 --> 03:59.906
Hey, what's sibling code number 99?

04:00.448 --> 04:01.699
-Say no to funk.
-Okay.

04:01.908 --> 04:04.160
So when I say funk, Pip says no.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.245
-Funk!
-No!

04:05.328 --> 04:07.413
-Funk!
-No!

04:07.997 --> 04:09.457
Hey, hey, sorry to interrupt.

04:09.540 --> 04:11.417
Oh, handsome stranger!

04:11.501 --> 04:13.044
I'm sorry, I like girls.

04:13.711 --> 04:16.965
So, the brunette behind me,
you see her, in the stripe bikini?

04:17.048 --> 04:19.342
She's either been clocking you
or she's been clocking me.

04:19.425 --> 04:21.511
I just wanna make sure
I'm not stepping on your game.

04:21.594 --> 04:23.680
No, you get her, man.
Go ahead, do your thing.

04:24.055 --> 04:26.474
Wait a second.
You're on billboards, right?

04:26.849 --> 04:28.851
-You're the autopsy guy?
-Private pathologist.

04:28.935 --> 04:30.103
Nice! Very cool.

04:30.186 --> 04:32.438
You actually helped the cops
catch the killers, or...

04:32.522 --> 04:35.525
Help them? Oh, no.
He thinks he is one.

04:35.608 --> 04:36.609
-Pip--
-Yeah.

04:36.693 --> 04:39.862
Chase the dudes down,
busting though doors,

04:39.946 --> 04:42.156
-dodging bullets.
-Oh, really?

04:42.240 --> 04:44.993
-You carry a gun?
-No, he has a partner. Okay?

04:45.201 --> 04:46.577
Ooh, and she is a bad-ass.

04:47.287 --> 04:50.540
Excuse me. We are bad-ass together.
We make our own rules.

04:50.623 --> 04:52.500
We do whatever it takes
to catch the criminal.

04:52.792 --> 04:54.502
-Thank you very much.
-You're welcome very much.

04:54.919 --> 04:56.504
-Cheers to that.
-Here you go.

04:56.587 --> 04:59.132
We'll see what's up
with striped bikini. Enjoy the night.

04:59.465 --> 05:02.176
Yeah, don't know if I'd strike,
but stripe bikini is hot.

05:02.260 --> 05:04.595
No, she may be a little too hot,
if that's a thing.

05:04.846 --> 05:05.805
No, that is not a thing.

05:05.888 --> 05:07.140
-It's not a thing?
-No.

05:07.223 --> 05:10.685
You know what's a thing? My sister
turned this place up tonight!

05:10.768 --> 05:12.478
Yeah, my little baby sister.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.260
Where the hell've you been
the last two weeks?

05:44.469 --> 05:45.720
Disney World and Busch Gardens.

05:45.803 --> 05:47.972
Mostly Busch Gardens.
I kinda bounced back and forth.

05:50.224 --> 05:52.727
I, um, heard you handed in your badge.

05:53.311 --> 05:56.022
I did. Mayor did me a solid.
You know, put a good word in for me.

05:56.105 --> 05:57.774
So they knocked me down
to Junior Detective,

05:57.857 --> 05:59.776
giving me a chance
to earn my old job back.

05:59.859 --> 06:02.528
But until they do,
I am not sitting in that bullpen.

06:02.612 --> 06:03.988
I just can't do it.

06:04.072 --> 06:06.491
-You wanna tell me what happened?
-No. Not really.

06:06.699 --> 06:08.659
Want to tell me what happened
with you and Rosey?

06:08.743 --> 06:09.952
Not really.

06:11.204 --> 06:14.707
And speaking of your old job,
the new captain starts today.

06:14.791 --> 06:16.334
He called me in for a sit-down.

06:18.211 --> 06:20.046
I'm a little nervous
about having a new boss.

06:21.297 --> 06:22.382
Me, too.

06:22.590 --> 06:24.717
Hey, maybe he's not that bad. Right?

06:24.801 --> 06:27.053
Yeah, it doesn't matter
who or what he is. Okay?

06:27.345 --> 06:29.680
I used to be captain here
and now he's captain here.

06:30.348 --> 06:32.266
Okay, it's human nature
for him to want me gone.

06:33.434 --> 06:34.685
We're gonna be fine.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.521
Damn right we are.

06:55.289 --> 06:57.083
-Rosey.
-Hey.

06:58.042 --> 06:59.877
What're you doing here?

06:59.961 --> 07:01.546
I came to meet the new captain.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.756
Yeah, I got the call this morning.

07:05.383 --> 07:06.384
-You want this seat?
-No.

07:06.884 --> 07:08.594
It's okay, you can sit here.
I'll just stand.

07:08.678 --> 07:13.474
I have to stand.
It's like a circulation thing.

07:13.766 --> 07:15.393
-Yeah, in the hammies.
-In the hammies.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.687
Yeah, the hammies, yes.
Blood flow, hamstrings,

07:17.770 --> 07:19.021
thrombosis comes on quick,

07:19.105 --> 07:20.857
so I gotta stand,
keep the heart pumping.

07:21.149 --> 07:22.400
From my toes, up till here.

07:23.234 --> 07:24.986
There she is, Detective Villa.

07:25.611 --> 07:28.489
Ryan Slade. Rosey.
It's good to see you again.

07:29.949 --> 07:31.868
-Again? What...
-Yeah, we...

07:32.201 --> 07:33.995
Partied at Moon Beach last night.

07:34.078 --> 07:36.372
-You didn't tell me you were--
-The new captain. I know.

07:36.706 --> 07:38.458
Sorry. I'm not stalking you, I swear.

07:38.541 --> 07:41.210
I just figured you'd be there
because your sister was performing.

07:41.669 --> 07:42.879
And the girl can sing, huh?

07:43.588 --> 07:47.467
And I wanted to get to know you
without the whole boss-employee thing.

07:47.758 --> 07:50.261
'Cause people are
never black and white.

07:51.053 --> 07:52.847
But you know what, Doctor?
I like you.

07:53.931 --> 07:55.475
Really. I'm a big fan.

07:57.059 --> 07:58.769
Because I hate the rules, too.

08:00.188 --> 08:01.230
Check this out.

08:01.314 --> 08:05.109
We have a 21-year-old college student
from East Miami University

08:05.193 --> 08:07.195
who was found dead
in the parking structure.

08:07.987 --> 08:09.780
Could be an accident.
It's too early to tell.

08:09.864 --> 08:11.616
Detective Feldheim was
first on the scene.

08:11.699 --> 08:14.285
Word is already spreading like fire
to the teachers and students.

08:14.368 --> 08:17.163
Rumbling from the Chief is that
this one could be high profile.

08:17.246 --> 08:19.123
-Why? Who is she?
-I don't know.

08:19.207 --> 08:21.626
You guys are this magical duo,
so you're working the case.

08:21.709 --> 08:24.295
Well, since Feldheim was first in,
maybe the case stays with him.

08:24.378 --> 08:25.630
...keep the case with Feldheim.

08:25.713 --> 08:28.549
Yeah, Feldheim, you know,
he's a sweet...

08:29.592 --> 08:30.801
Sweet man.

08:30.885 --> 08:33.971
But some people are made out for this,
and some people, like...

08:34.055 --> 08:35.181
Feldheim?

08:35.264 --> 08:37.642
Should've just stayed in Oshkosh
and worked on the family farm.

08:37.725 --> 08:39.644
-He's actually from Chattanooga.
-Close enough.

08:39.727 --> 08:40.853
He's out, you guys are in.

08:41.938 --> 08:43.981
Go, put that
incredible chemistry to work.

08:47.026 --> 08:49.779
My, uh, swingline.

08:50.321 --> 08:52.615
-Captain, welcome.
-Detective.

08:53.699 --> 08:55.159
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

09:11.092 --> 09:13.386
An EMU student's body's
coming in in the next couple of hours.

09:13.469 --> 09:14.637
I'm gonna prep fluid and tox.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.597
If you wanna get DNA panels
ready to rock, I've...

09:16.681 --> 09:19.141
I've got a surprise for you.

09:20.101 --> 09:21.227
Okay.

09:21.310 --> 09:24.230
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm aces.

09:26.107 --> 09:27.149
What's in the box?

09:27.900 --> 09:31.112
Ah, subject change.
It's suspicious, but I get it.

09:31.195 --> 09:34.031
This here is a HiSeq
DNA sequencer.

09:34.115 --> 09:35.700
It's my gift to the lab.

09:36.158 --> 09:37.660
Although, Rosey paid for it.

09:37.743 --> 09:39.745
And he doesn't know about it,
so it's a bit of a--

09:39.829 --> 09:42.248
Secret. Love me some secrets.

09:45.293 --> 09:46.335
Wow.

09:47.336 --> 09:49.255
-You haven't talked to Pippy yet.
-What?

09:50.089 --> 09:51.340
No.

09:51.716 --> 09:53.759
I don't know where she is
or what she's upto, so...

09:54.218 --> 09:56.554
It's awesome,
'cause it seems she's moved on.

09:58.639 --> 10:01.517
-I hate giving advice.
-But you're gonna give me some.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.477
You need to get back out there.

10:04.228 --> 10:06.397
And soon. You need to see
if you made the right choice.

10:06.480 --> 10:09.442
See if you need to fight
to get your girl back.

10:09.650 --> 10:11.319
Did you do something to your face?

10:13.404 --> 10:15.615
I just...
I mean, maybe I have

10:16.657 --> 10:19.493
the Matthew Fox Party of Five
thing going on.

10:19.577 --> 10:21.412
Yeah, it's the whiskers.

10:21.495 --> 10:23.497
It's not super noticeable.
I'm kind of a hairless wonder.

10:23.581 --> 10:25.666
-Oh. Oh, do not say--
-Hairless wonder again.

10:25.750 --> 10:27.251
-You did it again.
-Yes, I did it.

10:27.918 --> 10:28.961
Um...

10:31.547 --> 10:32.965
You're gonna be okay.

10:34.967 --> 10:36.469
-Am I?
-Yeah.

10:37.219 --> 10:40.139
'Cause you're like ten times
more resilient than me, and I'm okay.

10:42.099 --> 10:43.476
Okay.

11:04.163 --> 11:05.206
Oye, Doc.

11:06.582 --> 11:08.459
How fast can you give blood alcohol
on our victim?

11:10.169 --> 11:12.755
I'm thinking if she's wasted,
walking and texting, misses a step...

11:13.464 --> 11:15.841
Well, that is my guess, but you know,
that's just a guess

11:15.925 --> 11:17.176
until you two work your magic.

11:17.259 --> 11:18.594
Captain, what are you doing here?

11:18.678 --> 11:20.262
Come on,
there's no juice in the office.

11:20.346 --> 11:21.889
I live out on the field.
Always will.

11:22.390 --> 11:25.559
It's like I got a front row seat
to my first Rosey-Villa Show.

11:29.563 --> 11:30.690
I think that--

11:30.773 --> 11:32.525
-I'm sorry, you go ahead.
-It's okay, you go.

11:32.608 --> 11:34.068
No, I'm still processing, so...

11:34.819 --> 11:35.986
I think that--

11:36.070 --> 11:37.113
I thought you were still processing.

11:37.196 --> 11:39.073
I was, but I finished,
so now I'm ready to go.

11:42.118 --> 11:43.077
Come here.

11:44.954 --> 11:46.706
-We gotta get our game faces on.
-We got this.

11:46.789 --> 11:47.873
-We do.
-Like riding a bike.

11:47.957 --> 11:48.833
-I love bikes.
-You do?

11:48.916 --> 11:49.792
-No, I don't.
-Me either.

11:49.875 --> 11:51.335
Uh, everything okay?

11:54.505 --> 11:55.798
We got severe laceration on her forehead

11:55.881 --> 11:57.675
suggests a clean strike
against the pavement.

11:57.925 --> 12:00.052
Cassie didn't brace herself
before her head hit, meaning--

12:00.136 --> 12:01.804
She was already unconscious
when head struck the concrete.

12:01.887 --> 12:03.556
And the blood at the middle
of the stairs backs that up.

12:03.639 --> 12:06.142
I'm not seeing any signs of the girl
being heavily intoxicated.

12:06.225 --> 12:08.436
There's no oily residue on the skin,
no bloodshot eyes.

12:08.519 --> 12:09.812
I'm not comfortable
calling this an accident.

12:09.895 --> 12:10.938
Me either.

12:11.272 --> 12:12.106
But you're comfortable with

12:12.189 --> 12:14.692
the media having a field day
with a homicide on college campus?

12:14.817 --> 12:17.027
'Cause I smell
a bit of paranoia kicking in.

12:17.111 --> 12:20.072
Well, my gut is telling me that
this is a murder. Black and white.

12:20.156 --> 12:22.324
And we don't care
how messy things get.

12:22.408 --> 12:23.659
Cassie lost her life,

12:23.743 --> 12:26.370
and the search for how and why
is the only thing that drives us.

12:29.290 --> 12:31.876
That was awesome.

12:32.084 --> 12:36.297
I mean, you guys... I mean,
that's very good stuff there, folks.

12:36.380 --> 12:38.591
I mean, go,
go rattle some cages, guys.

12:39.550 --> 12:40.634
Let's see what shakes out.

12:43.262 --> 12:45.347
-So that means we're back?
-Yeah, I guess.

13:13.959 --> 13:16.837
Hi. The door was open.
I didn't know...

13:17.463 --> 13:19.632
I'm Betsy.
I live across the hall and--

13:19.715 --> 13:22.134
-Cassie was your friend?
-She was so awesome.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.054
You never think something like this
could happen to someone you know.

13:25.137 --> 13:27.097
Any idea who Cassie was with
last night?

13:27.264 --> 13:29.183
No, I'm surprised she went out at all.

13:29.809 --> 13:32.019
-She was having a hard time.
-Her mom passed away.

13:32.436 --> 13:33.938
She passed a couple of months ago.

13:34.230 --> 13:35.856
She flew home to Wisconsin
for the funeral,

13:35.940 --> 13:38.484
when she came back, she was different.

13:39.485 --> 13:40.694
She kept to herself.

13:41.278 --> 13:44.949
Betsy, if you hear anything about
who Cassie was with, give me a call.

13:45.366 --> 13:47.034
You know, everyone on campus
is really freaked out.

13:47.117 --> 13:50.371
I know, and we're doing everything
we can to catch whoever did this.

13:50.621 --> 13:52.039
-I promise.
-Thanks.

13:57.336 --> 13:59.129
Doctor Rosewood. How are you?

13:59.213 --> 14:01.465
I'm good. I'm liking the new addition.

14:01.549 --> 14:04.218
You mean the reception area
or your new receptionist?

14:04.301 --> 14:06.887
-Both. Dig the dress, too.
-Oh.

14:06.971 --> 14:08.848
I also saw the body.

14:09.807 --> 14:12.017
And it was really fascinating.

14:12.101 --> 14:14.895
But I get it now.
What you do, why you do it.

14:14.979 --> 14:17.064
I'm just really happy to be here.

14:20.693 --> 14:21.902
I'm happy you're here, too.

14:28.534 --> 14:30.119
- Good morning.
- Hey, Rosey.

14:30.452 --> 14:32.538
-Ready to fly?
-Like a bird.

14:32.621 --> 14:34.707
- Or a plane.
- Or anyone.

14:34.790 --> 14:36.625
-No? Okay.
-Give me room, please.

15:05.112 --> 15:06.155
We got you, Cassie.

15:07.031 --> 15:08.073
Show time.

15:10.117 --> 15:12.119
I need scans and screens
on all contusions,

15:12.202 --> 15:13.829
cotton swab on the nasal passages.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.998
-TMI, I need you run DNA on these hair.
-Yeah.

15:16.081 --> 15:18.375
Mitchie, we need x-rays, top to toes.

15:18.459 --> 15:21.170
I need full rundown on all bone breaks
and internal injuries ASAP.

15:21.253 --> 15:22.504
Done-dizzle.

15:22.588 --> 15:24.590
And until we find
a new toxicologist...

15:24.673 --> 15:27.259
I'm wearing two hats, which I think
is a pretty good look on me.

15:27.343 --> 15:30.054
Speaking of looks, have you
done something different today?

15:30.137 --> 15:33.307
Hey, you noticed. Yeah, I sexed up
my locks, test driving a new musk.

15:33.599 --> 15:34.975
-Yeah, it's not great.
-It's not, right?

15:35.059 --> 15:36.435
-No, but it could be.
-Right?

15:36.602 --> 15:38.771
-Ninety percent less musk.
-Yeah, less is more of a show.

15:38.854 --> 15:41.565
It's called Pure Brawn, by the way.
In case you want...

15:44.151 --> 15:45.152
Gonna get to work.

16:10.469 --> 16:12.304
-We need a dummy.
-Yes, we do.

16:13.097 --> 16:14.848
We absolutely... Wait, what?

16:15.557 --> 16:17.351
I wanna recreate
the crime scene right here,

16:17.434 --> 16:18.852
so we need a dummy.

16:18.936 --> 16:19.979
I got a great dummy guy.

16:20.062 --> 16:21.897
Larry Aubuchon.
French Canadian fellow.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.024
He can rush a body comp
that matches Cassie.

16:24.108 --> 16:26.235
-I can have it here within the hour.
-Get Larry to work.

16:26.318 --> 16:27.987
I got Cassie's cellphone records.

16:28.070 --> 16:29.613
And speaking of phones,

16:29.905 --> 16:31.448
I don't think hers was broken
from the fall.

16:31.532 --> 16:33.242
I think our killer
purposely shattered it,

16:33.325 --> 16:34.618
maybe because they're on it.

16:34.702 --> 16:36.829
I have forensics
pulling everything they can.

16:36.912 --> 16:41.291
Slade said this case high profile,
and I think I know why.

16:43.419 --> 16:45.129
Rosey wants you to go upstairs.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.006
Sorry.

16:52.970 --> 16:56.056
Rosey, I know that look. Okay?

16:56.140 --> 16:59.476
And just believe that I'm ready
to get back to the way things were.

17:00.602 --> 17:01.854
Cool?

17:01.937 --> 17:05.524
Yeah. Yeah, that's cool.

17:06.817 --> 17:08.360
Great. So, check it out.

17:08.444 --> 17:09.486
Cassie made three calls

17:09.570 --> 17:11.655
to Mayor Ramon Esparza's office
the day she died.

17:11.739 --> 17:13.490
Mayor Esparza. That's my man.

17:13.574 --> 17:15.409
Yeah, he's the most
influential politician

17:15.492 --> 17:16.952
here in Miami in the last 21 years.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.163
Two words for you, Villa. White House.

17:19.246 --> 17:21.081
-Well, he's--
-White House.

17:21.165 --> 17:23.000
He's also young and handsome,

17:23.083 --> 17:25.794
and that doesn't mix well
with a 21-year-old college coed.

17:26.336 --> 17:27.838
An affair.
It's a bit of a leap, isn't it?

17:27.921 --> 17:29.423
-Or is it?
-Well, it actually is.

17:29.506 --> 17:30.674
You know what, do me a favor,

17:30.758 --> 17:32.968
reel in on your infatuation
when we interview him. Okay?

17:33.052 --> 17:35.054
Okay. Hey, I take offense
to that remark.

17:35.137 --> 17:37.389
I'm very professional, Villa. Okay?

17:37.473 --> 17:39.391
Mayor Esparza! My man.

17:39.475 --> 17:40.851
-Mr. Rosewood.
-Nice to meet you.

17:40.934 --> 17:43.062
Real nice to meet you. Come on in.
I'm a fan of yours.

17:43.145 --> 17:44.730
-Wait, you know who I am?
-Of course.

17:44.813 --> 17:47.441
You must have cleaned up
the streets of Miami more than I have.

17:47.816 --> 17:50.110
See, you're trying to make me blush.

17:50.194 --> 17:52.863
That DNC speech you said last year,
hit me right here in the heart.

17:52.946 --> 17:54.323
Well, I can't take all the credit.

17:54.406 --> 17:56.992
I mean, my right-hand man,
James Patton helped write it.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.368
He can pretty much read my mind.

17:58.452 --> 18:00.746
You can read his mind.
Jimmy, that's a good job you did.

18:00.829 --> 18:02.122
Nice. Great job.

18:02.206 --> 18:03.749
And what is this? What?

18:03.832 --> 18:06.126
You have a housing project
in good school districts?

18:06.210 --> 18:08.921
This right here, makes me want to
take out my checkbook right now.

18:09.004 --> 18:10.089
Did you bring it with you?

18:10.714 --> 18:13.133
So, great, Mayor Esparza.

18:13.217 --> 18:15.219
I hate to ruin the mood,
but do you know this girl?

18:15.636 --> 18:16.970
Cassie Hanson.

18:17.054 --> 18:19.640
-I do know her. Yes.
-She's dead.

18:20.349 --> 18:21.767
And we think she was murdered.

18:21.975 --> 18:24.520
Perhaps we should clear the room,
give you guys some privacy.

18:24.603 --> 18:27.731
-I'm not going anywhere.
-Everyone can stay. It's fine.

18:27.815 --> 18:30.109
I met with Cassie
on a couple of occasions.

18:30.192 --> 18:31.610
I visit college campuses a lot.

18:31.693 --> 18:34.905
The youth vote is central
to Ramon's political success.

18:35.447 --> 18:37.032
When I heard that she had passed away,

18:37.116 --> 18:40.744
I simply asked that her case
would be handled by our very finest.

18:40.828 --> 18:42.496
See, and I would have done the same thing.

18:42.579 --> 18:44.581
Now real quick, Is there any reason
why she would have called your office

18:44.665 --> 18:46.083
three times the day she was killed?

18:46.166 --> 18:48.127
Perhaps to ask for some advice.
I'm just guessing.

18:48.210 --> 18:50.462
Did you ever have
a physical relationship?

18:50.546 --> 18:51.755
No. Never.

18:51.839 --> 18:53.841
Okay, great. Now, one last thing.

18:53.924 --> 18:55.509
We need to know your whereabouts
on the last night--

18:55.592 --> 18:58.762
-I could check his schedule--
-Nobody needs to check his schedule.

18:58.846 --> 19:01.098
He was at home. With me.

19:01.181 --> 19:02.599
A young girl lost her life.

19:02.683 --> 19:04.017
You're telling me it was murder,

19:04.101 --> 19:06.645
I'm telling you my door
is always open. No matter what.

19:06.728 --> 19:08.522
And I'm telling you I'm right there
with you Mr. Mayor.

19:08.605 --> 19:09.857
-I'm right there with you.
-Okay.

19:09.940 --> 19:12.442
-I'm liking this pin with this tie...
-Thank you for your time.

19:12.526 --> 19:15.362
-...with the gold and the gold...
-Rosey! Rosey.

19:16.405 --> 19:17.239
Thank you.

19:17.322 --> 19:18.532
Mayor Esparza, my man.

19:18.615 --> 19:20.909
Jimmy, be nice with that speech.

19:27.708 --> 19:29.585
Okay, guys, wish I could say
tenth time's a charm,

19:29.668 --> 19:31.587
but I can't,
'cause it still makes no sense.

19:31.670 --> 19:32.880
Cassie's external injuries

19:32.963 --> 19:35.424
are indicative of
her falling down the stairs

19:35.507 --> 19:37.801
and her internal organs
underwent extreme trauma.

19:37.885 --> 19:40.095
Looks like she was physically
assaulted from the inside.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.430
Maybe this has
something to do with it.

19:41.513 --> 19:43.599
Halothane, chloroform's ugly twin.

19:43.682 --> 19:45.350
Her oral swab tested positive.

19:45.517 --> 19:48.020
So, someone snuck up behind Cassie,
rendered her unconscious,

19:48.103 --> 19:49.146
and then shoved her down the stairs.

19:49.229 --> 19:51.565
That still doesn't explain why her
insides and outsides don't match.

19:51.648 --> 19:53.942
Unless, she had an allergic reaction
to the halothane.

19:54.443 --> 19:57.404
The things that go on
when I'm not around.

19:57.613 --> 19:58.614
I'll be back in a flash.

19:58.906 --> 20:00.532
Excuse me again. Okay.

20:02.409 --> 20:04.328
-Hi, sweetie.
-Hi, Ms. D.

20:04.411 --> 20:07.164
You taking a break from
all that weirdness downstairs?

20:07.247 --> 20:08.707
No, never.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.668
But I'm just gonna
rip the Band-Aid off here.

20:12.169 --> 20:15.923
I got a call from the Daytona
Maximum Security Prison this morning.

20:16.006 --> 20:21.053
And they left you a video key
for inmate 1-8-9-2-0, Gerald Kelly.

20:21.136 --> 20:23.013
So you two can talk

20:23.597 --> 20:25.641
and, you know,
just see each other on screens.

20:26.934 --> 20:28.685
Okay. Well...

20:29.561 --> 20:31.772
I've an idea.
I can just walk away from this forever

20:31.855 --> 20:33.815
and pretend that
it doesn't bother me everyday.

20:34.024 --> 20:36.526
Many letters come to this lab,
people asking for help,

20:36.610 --> 20:39.404
their cases didn't go the way
they want them to go, so,

20:40.030 --> 20:43.242
I read them all, his moved me,
so I reached out.

20:43.325 --> 20:44.576
We talk about his case.

20:45.535 --> 20:47.496
Ms. D, with all due respect,

20:47.913 --> 20:49.414
what the hell's going on with you?

20:49.748 --> 20:54.628
And what I mean by that is,
what the hell is going on with you?

20:55.420 --> 20:56.713
Kids are grown, marriage over,

20:56.797 --> 20:58.382
and I have a job
around here doing what?

20:58.465 --> 21:01.677
Do you have any idea
what I do around here?

21:01.760 --> 21:03.428
What you do around here?

21:03.512 --> 21:04.596
I do not know.

21:06.974 --> 21:11.520
So now I feel like I have found
something actually worth doing.

21:11.603 --> 21:13.939
I can't explain it. I just...

21:14.147 --> 21:17.651
I just feel compelled
to help this man.

21:17.734 --> 21:22.030
Because with every fiber of my being,
I believe him.

21:23.115 --> 21:26.159
-Rosey, taking a commercial break?
-Yeah, no. All right.

21:26.868 --> 21:27.995
What did he do?

21:29.705 --> 21:31.206
He's accused of murder.

21:31.999 --> 21:33.625
Yes, I know.

21:33.709 --> 21:36.586
I'm going to tell Beaumont
and Pippy myself.

21:36.670 --> 21:39.006
I'm just not ready.

21:39.631 --> 21:41.633
Okay? I have my reasons.

21:42.551 --> 21:43.593
Oh, boy.

21:47.639 --> 21:48.807
So brutal.

21:49.224 --> 21:51.601
Esparza is a real prize.

21:51.685 --> 21:54.229
A self-made golden boy
heading straight to the top.

21:54.313 --> 21:56.648
But my gut's telling me
there's something there.

21:56.732 --> 21:59.526
I think all those people in his
inner circle are protecting him.

21:59.776 --> 22:01.570
The wife, the hot assistant.

22:01.653 --> 22:03.363
Why don't you
get the mayor down here solo?

22:03.447 --> 22:05.574
Without the protection,
give him the Villa treatment.

22:05.657 --> 22:07.200
Because I have zero evidence.

22:07.284 --> 22:09.745
And thought I'd avoid getting fired
by you on day one

22:09.828 --> 22:13.123
for interrogating the mayor because
I have a gut feeling and nothing more.

22:13.206 --> 22:14.624
That makes so much sense.

22:16.001 --> 22:18.128
You know what?
I don't like this guy's face.

22:18.962 --> 22:20.714
Me either, but he had an alibi.

22:21.548 --> 22:24.593
Detective, do we have anybody
on this table that is a real suspect?

22:24.676 --> 22:27.137
Not yet, but Feldheim is
canvasing the campus

22:27.220 --> 22:29.556
and I'm still digging
into Cassie's last 24 hours.

22:29.639 --> 22:31.558
So far nobody's talking about
who she was with

22:31.641 --> 22:32.809
or where she was last night.

22:32.893 --> 22:36.271
My guess? Based on items that we found
in her purse, nightclub.

22:37.773 --> 22:40.567
So, should we visit
all 270 clubs in Miami

22:40.650 --> 22:41.943
to see which one she was at?

22:44.071 --> 22:45.280
That was a dick thing to say.

22:46.656 --> 22:48.742
But seriously, I mean,
should we go to every club in Miami?

22:48.825 --> 22:49.826
You don't need to.

22:50.660 --> 22:51.828
The bracelet.

22:51.912 --> 22:54.623
Worn a few over the years myself.
Got married on a booze cruise.

22:54.706 --> 22:55.707
Wasn't great.

22:57.250 --> 22:58.335
Anyway...

23:00.629 --> 23:02.506
be in the basement
if anybody needs me.

23:17.938 --> 23:19.064
Step back. Saul.

23:21.066 --> 23:22.317
It's Miami PD.

23:23.026 --> 23:24.444
Why don't you step outside for me?

23:36.248 --> 23:37.290
Wow.

23:37.374 --> 23:39.126
There's almost
too much DNA in this bus.

23:39.209 --> 23:40.377
-Who does this?
-Animals.

23:40.669 --> 23:41.878
That's what I'm telling you.

23:42.379 --> 23:43.839
You seem pretty upset
at those animals.

23:43.922 --> 23:45.882
-I still am.
-After they stiffed you on the bill

23:45.966 --> 23:47.968
-did you go looking for them?
-Damn right I did.

23:48.677 --> 23:50.971
I don't know where they are.
They gave me a fake name.

23:51.054 --> 23:52.889
And you found one of them, didn't you?

23:52.973 --> 23:54.975
Lost your temper,
did something stupid.

23:55.684 --> 23:56.810
Maybe to this girl?

23:57.644 --> 24:00.480
-Yeah, she was there. But I never--
-Well, now she's dead.

24:00.564 --> 24:02.441
Dead? What are you saying?

24:02.524 --> 24:04.609
Mind if I get a closer look
at your chest?

24:04.693 --> 24:06.611
Man, I don't care. Whatever.

24:07.237 --> 24:09.114
But I didn't kill that girl.

24:09.197 --> 24:11.992
And these scratches didn't come
from her, they came from...

24:12.075 --> 24:13.743
-An animal.
-Yes!

24:13.827 --> 24:15.287
A wild dog.

24:15.871 --> 24:18.331
A deformed wild dog.

24:18.415 --> 24:20.876
Based on those lacerations
I think he's telling the truth.

24:20.959 --> 24:24.004
And I also think those hair fibers
I found on Cassie's body,

24:24.087 --> 24:25.755
whatever it was came from this cage.

24:27.340 --> 24:31.470
-Do you have an alibi?
-Yeah. Emergency room. Tetanus shot.

24:31.553 --> 24:36.433
So I don't freakin' get rabies
and I had to ice bath my ass.

24:37.309 --> 24:38.727
Your ass? Why?

24:40.145 --> 24:43.023
Those bastards spanked me like I was--

24:43.106 --> 24:45.692
Stop. Stop. You got to warn people
before you do stuff like that.

24:45.775 --> 24:47.986
-Please , pull your pants up.
-No, no. Hold on. One sec.

24:48.403 --> 24:49.488
Hang on.

24:50.030 --> 24:51.740
Man, don't make this weirder
than it has to be.

24:51.823 --> 24:53.200
Hey, Villa.
Take a picture of Sal's ass.

24:53.283 --> 24:56.036
-Come on, guys.
-Right there. Yeah.

24:56.328 --> 24:57.662
And the bruise patterns
may be helpful.

24:57.871 --> 24:59.956
Just have to magnify those images
when I get back to the lab.

25:00.040 --> 25:01.333
Like, real big.

25:01.458 --> 25:03.627
-Not cool, dude.
-Yeah, tell me about it.

25:03.919 --> 25:06.004
So, what else can you tell us
about the party that night.

25:06.087 --> 25:08.006
That girl was getting freaky
with the giant d-bag.

25:08.089 --> 25:09.257
She wasn't in to it,

25:09.674 --> 25:11.426
it got heated, she got of the bus.

25:11.510 --> 25:12.928
Can you describe that guy to us?

25:13.386 --> 25:16.932
He spanked me. So, yeah.
I got a good look at the bastard.

25:23.688 --> 25:25.524
-Thank you.
-I'll take that.

25:25.607 --> 25:27.692
This same animal came to my place.

25:27.776 --> 25:29.402
Hey, I have a pet owl.
What do you have?

25:29.736 --> 25:32.489
I don't have a pet.
Pretty adorable, Mitchie.

25:35.450 --> 25:36.993
-It's case related.
-It's case related.

25:37.202 --> 25:38.286
I'm sure it is.

25:38.995 --> 25:40.997
-So, late lunch?
-Not exactly.

25:41.790 --> 25:44.459
"Not exactly".
So, I have you whispering to TMI

25:44.543 --> 25:46.670
and not exactly taking a late lunch.

25:46.753 --> 25:48.046
Son, I'm fine.

25:50.131 --> 25:52.133
So, who was she?

25:52.592 --> 25:54.344
-The victim?
-Cassie Hanson.

25:54.427 --> 25:56.596
She's a young student
with an incredible future.

25:57.389 --> 26:00.267
Recently lost her mother
and that was the only family she had.

26:01.142 --> 26:02.852
That's why it's up to me
to fight for her.

26:03.228 --> 26:04.854
I'm so proud of you.

26:04.938 --> 26:08.400
Being there for someone
when they don't have anyone else.

26:11.236 --> 26:12.362
Love you.

26:16.658 --> 26:18.368
Cassie's medical records are clean.

26:18.451 --> 26:20.036
Injuries still don't make any sense.

26:20.120 --> 26:21.955
And the amount of hands that
were on this sex doll

26:22.038 --> 26:23.248
also doesn't make any sense.

26:23.331 --> 26:26.001
You know, what does make sense?
I tested the animal hair on the bus

26:26.084 --> 26:27.836
and it turns out it's not
from a wild dog...

26:27.919 --> 26:30.338
From a badger.
It's the school mascot at EMU.

26:30.422 --> 26:32.173
We just got a match from the DNA

26:32.257 --> 26:34.175
from the saliva
that was found on Cassie's body,

26:34.259 --> 26:36.428
I ran it through every system,
we got a hit on a guy

26:36.511 --> 26:39.389
who's donated sperm
more than anyone ever.

26:39.472 --> 26:42.225
-Dwayne Scott Pippin.
-A member of Epsilon Theta.

26:42.309 --> 26:44.686
Those damn ET's.
They paddled Saul with a frat bat.

26:48.231 --> 26:51.401
I'm sorry, I pledged Gamma-Gamma-Psi
when I was in school.

26:51.484 --> 26:53.403
And our rivals, the Epsilons.

26:53.486 --> 26:57.115
-You pledged what?
-Gamma-gamma-go via g-dogs for life.

26:57.198 --> 26:58.908
-G-dog?
-For life! Yes.

26:59.367 --> 27:01.161
Now, can we please go put
the screws on Lane?

27:01.244 --> 27:02.621
He's our new prime suspect.

27:02.704 --> 27:04.122
Yes, I'll drive.

27:04.372 --> 27:07.626
-One car?
-Yes, one car. Let's go.

27:10.420 --> 27:11.755
One car.

27:17.636 --> 27:18.887
This must be it.

27:20.639 --> 27:21.890
Rosey, I'm sorry.

27:22.849 --> 27:24.809
I'm sorry for

27:25.226 --> 27:26.353
the things I said.

27:28.021 --> 27:29.731
You were right about everything.

27:31.816 --> 27:33.109
I just hope you can forgive me.

27:36.404 --> 27:37.906
So can we talk about Eddie?

27:37.989 --> 27:39.658
I didn't say
I wanted to talk about it,

27:39.741 --> 27:41.159
I just said you were right.

27:41.785 --> 27:43.953
I just want us to move on.

27:54.130 --> 27:55.548
I'm looking for Lane Piven.

27:55.632 --> 27:56.966
Yeah, that's me. I'm Lane.

27:57.050 --> 27:59.010
-What do you want?
-We know what Lane looks like.

27:59.094 --> 28:00.261
You don't know what you know.

28:00.345 --> 28:01.596
You're standing
in front of a picture of him.

28:03.973 --> 28:06.476
Well, Lane's super busy.
So...

28:06.935 --> 28:09.896
Cassie Hanson was murdered and
you realize you're talking to a cop?

28:10.063 --> 28:11.481
You got to be smarter, my man.

28:11.564 --> 28:12.982
See I'm not your man, bro.

28:13.066 --> 28:14.984
I'm an Epsilon
and you're in our house.

28:15.360 --> 28:19.364
-So, unless you wanna pledge...
-No, can do my friend.

28:19.447 --> 28:21.449
Okay? I'm a G-dog.

28:21.533 --> 28:23.618
Alpha Chapter,
but former president, thank you.

28:23.702 --> 28:26.162
Hear that, boys.
We got an enemy in our midst.

28:26.913 --> 28:29.082
Tell me, bring your
cute little stepping boots with ya?

28:29.165 --> 28:30.959
No, but I brought my big ass cane.

28:31.042 --> 28:32.168
-Your cane?
-Yeah, my cane.

28:32.252 --> 28:33.211
-What do you do with a cane.
-It's a...

28:33.294 --> 28:35.714
Okay. Enough.
Lane Piven, where is he?

28:45.390 --> 28:46.558
Hey, you all right?

28:51.104 --> 28:54.941
Well, Detective, you want the cameras
on or off for this interrogation?

28:55.400 --> 28:56.818
-What?
-The cameras...

28:57.193 --> 28:59.612
You want me to put them off
to enjoy a little creative freedom

28:59.696 --> 29:01.948
with the frat boy here
until he's ready to break?

29:08.163 --> 29:10.582
Ah. There's my little Epsilon.

29:10.665 --> 29:13.251
Hey, just because you're a fox
doesn't mean I'm gonna talk to ya.

29:13.334 --> 29:15.128
Cool. You think I'm a fox?

29:15.211 --> 29:16.588
That's so sweet.

29:16.671 --> 29:19.549
Lane, can I paint you a picture
that's just as ugly

29:19.632 --> 29:22.135
as that ridiculous portrait of you
back at the frat house?

29:22.302 --> 29:24.429
I painted that myself and it's dope.

29:24.512 --> 29:27.098
Wow, you should never paint again
and you never will

29:27.182 --> 29:30.018
because I think you're gonna go
to prison for murdering Cassie.

29:30.351 --> 29:33.396
-I didn't kill anyone.
-Yet, you jumped in your car and run.

29:33.480 --> 29:35.148
That doesn't scream innocent to me.

29:35.231 --> 29:37.400
Because I stiffed the party bus guy.

29:37.901 --> 29:39.694
And stole the school mascot, too,

29:39.778 --> 29:41.196
which I still cant find.

29:41.279 --> 29:43.948
And I sent some nasty texts to Cassie.

29:44.407 --> 29:46.618
But it's because she might be
the only chick on campus

29:46.701 --> 29:48.495
who doesn't want
to have some sex with me.

29:49.996 --> 29:50.955
You wanna know what I think?

29:51.039 --> 29:54.667
I think she embarrassed you
on that bus in front of your brothers.

29:54.751 --> 29:57.045
I think you followed her
to the parking garage

29:57.128 --> 29:59.923
and fought with her,
maybe her fall was just an accident?

30:00.006 --> 30:01.090
You tell me.

30:01.883 --> 30:03.426
All right, you and Villa...

30:03.968 --> 30:07.138
Rumor mill out in the pen was on point
you guys click like crazy.

30:08.139 --> 30:09.349
Come on, man. Talk to me.

30:09.432 --> 30:12.352
-Is it more than a work thing?
-It's just a work thing.

30:12.435 --> 30:15.271
Really? So, why was your vibe
laced with so much tension

30:15.355 --> 30:16.606
when I first rolled in?

30:16.689 --> 30:18.024
Some other drama between you two?

30:19.317 --> 30:21.486
-Everything is fine.
-Everything is not fine.

30:23.071 --> 30:27.075
You know, I'm here
if you wanna hang, chat about it.

30:27.784 --> 30:30.203
-I'm good, yeah.
-Okay. All right.

30:30.620 --> 30:32.872
The bruising on Cassie's arms
from where you grabbed her

30:32.956 --> 30:34.374
tells me you got physical.

30:35.708 --> 30:37.752
Come on.
We pulled your prints from her skin.

30:38.086 --> 30:40.338
You can't pull prints from skin.

30:40.421 --> 30:42.590
-Are you high right now?
-No.

30:43.633 --> 30:45.176
I don't think so.

30:46.094 --> 30:47.178
Maybe. Why?

30:47.262 --> 30:49.430
Because if you think
we can't pull prints from bare skin

30:49.514 --> 30:51.766
then you must have smoked up a fatty.

30:51.850 --> 30:54.018
Or you're just extra dumb or both.

30:54.352 --> 30:56.521
-Did we pull prints from her skin?
-No. No, we did not.

30:56.604 --> 30:59.941
Okay, I grabbed her
and I tried to French kiss her.

31:00.024 --> 31:02.777
-French kiss? Like from the '80s?
-Yeah.

31:02.861 --> 31:05.572
But she wasn't down,
so, I just asked her for a hickie.

31:05.655 --> 31:07.824
Just so I'd have something
to show the dudes on Monday.

31:07.907 --> 31:09.617
Are you a real person?

31:10.493 --> 31:14.497
Look, Cassie was all upset about
her mom dying a couple of months ago

31:14.581 --> 31:16.541
and she was acting all weird, okay.

31:17.125 --> 31:20.837
Girl was rubbing sunscreen on herself
on a party bus at night.

31:20.920 --> 31:22.297
I mean, who does that?

31:22.380 --> 31:23.423
Sunscreen...

31:24.674 --> 31:27.844
-Analgesic.
-Cool. Analgesic.

31:28.177 --> 31:29.888
-What?
-It's a topical pain reliever.

31:29.971 --> 31:31.723
I think I know why the inside
of Cassie's body

31:31.806 --> 31:32.974
doesn't match the outside.

31:34.684 --> 31:37.437
I ran the blood splits
and you were right. Hemophilia.

31:37.520 --> 31:39.522
-Which is weird 'cause that's...
-Very rare in females.

31:39.606 --> 31:41.524
Yeah, less than
a one percent chance.

31:41.608 --> 31:43.192
No wonder it didn't show
in her records.

31:43.276 --> 31:44.986
She must have been
recently diagnosed here in Miami.

31:45.069 --> 31:47.530
And now we know why
her internal wounds are so extreme.

31:47.614 --> 31:48.698
Right.

31:48.781 --> 31:51.159
Abnormal bleeding
because of the blood disorder...

31:52.118 --> 31:54.162
Mitchie, did Cassie's mother
have the same disease?

31:54.245 --> 31:56.080
Not according to our medical records.

31:56.164 --> 31:59.250
And the high set comes through
in the clutch. No big deal.

31:59.334 --> 32:02.170
The hair fibers we found on Cassie,
not from the badger.

32:02.253 --> 32:05.256
But they were from an animal.
Just not a live one.

32:05.840 --> 32:07.467
It's chemically treated sheep's wool.

32:08.134 --> 32:10.470
-You're welcome.
-Sheep's wool?

32:12.597 --> 32:14.390
-Wow...
-Wow?

32:14.724 --> 32:16.017
Lane didn't do it.

32:16.976 --> 32:18.686
This is big.

32:26.069 --> 32:29.405
I got something good.

32:29.489 --> 32:31.407
Ladies first. Stop it.

32:31.491 --> 32:33.660
Cassie was exchanging emails
with Susan Sanchez,

32:33.743 --> 32:35.662
the reporter from Box
about meeting today.

32:35.745 --> 32:38.122
She said, that Cassie promised
that her story was explosive.

32:38.206 --> 32:40.291
I'm thinking we were right
about the mayor having an affair.

32:40.375 --> 32:42.961
And I'm thinking we were
wrong about the affair.

32:43.044 --> 32:44.545
-Are you sure?
-Positive.

32:44.629 --> 32:48.216
They weren't lovers.
Mayor Esparza was Cassie's father.

32:54.806 --> 32:57.600
So, Cassie had a rare form of
hemophilia. Her mother didn't have it,

32:57.684 --> 32:59.394
so I believe she inherited it
from her dad.

32:59.477 --> 33:01.270
And you think
Mayor Esparza has this disease.

33:01.354 --> 33:04.482
I do. But I have to get a look at his
upper torso and lower body to be sure.

33:04.983 --> 33:07.694
Doctor, I'm no doctor, but
I'm pretty sure that's the whole body.

33:07.777 --> 33:08.778
It is.

33:08.861 --> 33:11.531
Great. Should I ask the mayor
to swing by and get naked in the pen?

33:11.614 --> 33:12.949
You know what we should do?

33:13.032 --> 33:15.076
We should all get naked.
Make it less weird for him.

33:15.159 --> 33:18.162
Well, Captain, we know Cassie was
about to go to the press,

33:18.246 --> 33:21.249
maybe she was gonna tell the world she
was the mayor's illegitimate child.

33:21.332 --> 33:23.084
All right, should we draw straws

33:23.167 --> 33:25.628
to see who gets to drag the major
into an interrogation room?

33:25.712 --> 33:27.338
Well, you don't gotta
drag him anywhere.

33:27.422 --> 33:29.132
Best place to question him,
on his own turf,

33:29.215 --> 33:30.550
and I should be the one to do it.

33:31.384 --> 33:33.344
I love the short straw.
What do you say, Captain?

33:34.679 --> 33:37.473
-I don't hate this plan.
-I do, and I'll interrogate the mayor.

33:38.725 --> 33:42.729
We both know it's a bad idea for you
to it for so many reasons, don't we?

33:43.229 --> 33:45.148
The day I let politics stop me
from doing my job

33:45.231 --> 33:46.441
is the day I stop being a cop.

33:46.524 --> 33:48.109
Look, I get a confession, case closed.

33:48.192 --> 33:50.820
I don't, maybe one less bald guy
you got in the basement.

33:53.281 --> 33:54.365
Do what you got to do.

33:56.492 --> 33:58.161
Anything I should know before I go?

34:02.832 --> 34:04.542
Ira, I barely knew this girl.

34:05.668 --> 34:07.962
Big secrets have a way
of biting you in the ass.

34:08.046 --> 34:09.380
Believe me, I know.

34:09.464 --> 34:11.591
Mr. Mayor, you looked out for me.

34:11.674 --> 34:14.886
You know how much I care
about this job, the city.

34:15.470 --> 34:17.013
We're the same that way.

34:17.096 --> 34:18.222
I wanna look in your eyes

34:18.306 --> 34:20.600
the same way you looked in mine
a couple of weeks back,

34:21.601 --> 34:22.769
and hear the truth.

34:24.062 --> 34:26.022
You think I killed Cassie?

34:26.105 --> 34:28.316
The man I know
could never do something like that.

34:28.691 --> 34:30.610
And I'm praying right now
that you didn't.

34:31.694 --> 34:32.695
Ask away.

34:33.821 --> 34:36.491
You have an image, pristine,

34:36.574 --> 34:38.451
Senate run coming up,
that you got in the bag.

34:39.035 --> 34:40.870
I mean, there's no stopping
a rock star like you

34:40.953 --> 34:42.955
from laying his head once
where Obama laid his.

34:44.290 --> 34:48.503
But a media blitz about an affair,
having a child out of wedlock,

34:49.837 --> 34:51.547
that could jeopardize everything.

34:51.631 --> 34:54.050
What are you asking for? DNA?

34:54.133 --> 34:55.343
I don't need it.

34:56.469 --> 34:59.138
Cassie had something called
T-cranial hemophilia,

34:59.680 --> 35:01.224
likely inherited from her father.

35:03.518 --> 35:06.604
You mind rolling up your sleeve so
I can check an inter-vascular port?

35:07.396 --> 35:09.357
You get a lot of
blood transfusions, yeah?

35:13.653 --> 35:15.279
When Cassie's mother died,

35:16.322 --> 35:17.406
she found some letters,

35:18.449 --> 35:19.826
discovered I was her father.

35:21.160 --> 35:22.245
She contacted me,

35:22.328 --> 35:24.372
I was open
to having a relationship with her.

35:25.540 --> 35:28.960
I just asked her if she could
keep it a secret till after elections.

35:30.336 --> 35:31.337
She agreed.

35:31.838 --> 35:33.381
So why was she gonna go to the press?

35:34.173 --> 35:35.341
What are you talking about?

35:35.424 --> 35:38.761
Sheep's wool from this rug
was found on her body.

35:38.845 --> 35:40.513
She visited you hours before she died.

35:40.596 --> 35:42.974
I'm thinking to tell you
she was gonna spill the beans.

35:43.057 --> 35:44.767
Do not lie to me.

35:44.851 --> 35:47.979
I swear, if she was in my office
yesterday, I didn't see her.

35:48.062 --> 35:50.815
So you were at home with Linda
at the time of Cassie's murder?

35:53.484 --> 35:56.154
Your long-suffering wife
still covering a few bad habits?

35:57.572 --> 35:58.573
Who were you with?

35:59.657 --> 36:01.284
Hannah Connor, my assistant.

36:03.953 --> 36:05.997
So, am I in the clear?

36:08.708 --> 36:11.502
You know, I kept a lot of secrets
for my children's sake,

36:11.752 --> 36:14.297
but your secret might be the reason
why your daughter was murdered.

36:14.380 --> 36:15.923
So, yeah, I think you're in the clear.

36:17.884 --> 36:19.677
But I can't say the same
for your conscience.

36:24.223 --> 36:26.058
Hey, Cap.
You're gonna want to hear this.

36:27.685 --> 36:30.021
Okay, the mayor didn't kill Cassie.

36:30.104 --> 36:32.064
Came clean with his alibi
and it checked out.

36:32.648 --> 36:35.860
I'd take your word for it,
but you guys are friends, yeah?

36:36.235 --> 36:38.446
Look, it's all here.
Listen for yourself.

36:39.739 --> 36:42.491
I'm hungry. Anybody want anything?
I'm buying.

36:42.950 --> 36:45.286
-Honey bun and a cup of coffee.
-Honey bun?

36:46.579 --> 36:49.123
All right. But get your own coffee.

36:51.167 --> 36:53.211
So, what now? We got nothing?

36:53.294 --> 36:55.129
Actually no, we do have something.

36:55.213 --> 36:56.714
Cassie's hemophilia wasn't discovered

36:56.797 --> 36:59.091
until she took a paternity test
in Miami a few months ago.

36:59.175 --> 37:01.552
Meaning, only a few people would've known
that a fall down the stairs

37:01.636 --> 37:03.221
would be fatal
because of her condition.

37:03.304 --> 37:05.014
And of all the people
in the mayor's inner circle...

37:05.097 --> 37:06.390
Only one doesn't have an alibi.

37:06.474 --> 37:07.725
I think I know who the killer is.

37:07.808 --> 37:09.727
Me, too.
But we have no smoking gun.

37:10.519 --> 37:11.729
Or do we?

37:11.812 --> 37:12.813
Come on!

37:18.194 --> 37:20.488
Attie, I can't see the image clearly.
Clean it up.

37:20.571 --> 37:22.573
-You're making me nervous.
-Villa, it's your tone.

37:22.657 --> 37:23.824
Yes, it's your tone.

37:23.908 --> 37:26.702
Now can you please tighten up on the
fuzzy stuff and focus in on the eyes?

37:28.079 --> 37:29.705
Now that's how you talk to people.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.542
And there's our killer.

37:38.214 --> 37:40.466
-Rosey, you know what's kinda crazy?
-What's that, Villa?

37:40.549 --> 37:42.385
-Technology.
-Really? Crazy how?

37:42.468 --> 37:44.887
Well, say a killer
smashed his victim's phone,

37:44.971 --> 37:48.599
but in the process, it accidentally
snapped a picture of his twisted face.

37:48.683 --> 37:50.184
-What?
-Yep.

37:50.268 --> 37:52.561
Then you get Attie over here,
a gifted tech genius...

37:52.645 --> 37:54.272
-That's me.
-Put your hand down.

37:54.689 --> 37:57.400
Attie over here
does a bunch of nerdy stuff, and...

37:57.483 --> 37:59.694
Boom. You find this.

38:01.237 --> 38:02.613
This came from Cassie's phone.

38:03.447 --> 38:05.241
We knew you were there
when she went down those stairs.

38:05.324 --> 38:06.659
Which means you were the one
that killed her.

38:06.742 --> 38:09.745
You knew about her hemophilia,
discovered after her paternity test.

38:09.829 --> 38:11.539
You also knew that a fall
down the stairs

38:11.622 --> 38:13.708
for someone in Cassie's condition
could prove fatal.

38:13.791 --> 38:15.668
James, you want to explain this?

38:17.211 --> 38:19.839
She threatened you.
She was going to ruin your reputation.

38:20.298 --> 38:21.549
Our future.

38:21.924 --> 38:25.177
In two election cycles,
I'll be in the White House.

38:26.721 --> 38:28.306
She refused to keep her mouth shut

38:28.389 --> 38:30.516
and I didn't think
anyone was gonna miss her.

38:30.683 --> 38:32.476
We didn't think you'd step
right into our trap.

38:32.560 --> 38:35.229
See, James, we didn't need
a smoking gun to nail you.

38:35.313 --> 38:36.314
So we created our own.

38:36.397 --> 38:37.898
There was no image on Cassie's phone.

38:37.982 --> 38:39.984
But it didn't take long
for Attie to mock one up.

38:40.526 --> 38:43.029
-You can't do that.
-Actually, I think we just did do that.

38:43.112 --> 38:44.405
And you're done.

38:48.784 --> 38:51.329
Mayor Esparza, are you okay?

38:51.662 --> 38:53.622
No, I'm not.

38:54.332 --> 38:57.126
I'll never get a chance to say
everything I wanted to say to Cassie,

38:58.294 --> 38:59.378
to make amends,

39:01.422 --> 39:02.923
have a relationship with her.

39:05.176 --> 39:07.345
I don't think I could
ever forgive myself for that.

39:07.678 --> 39:10.765
You're right. You'll never know
how amazing your daughter really was.

39:12.558 --> 39:13.809
And that's your fault.

39:18.564 --> 39:20.941
Don't ever forgive yourself. Okay?

39:35.956 --> 39:38.417
Ira, what are you doing in here?

39:39.001 --> 39:41.587
Just admiring what you've done
with the place.

39:42.713 --> 39:44.340
You know, this doesn't
have to be painful.

39:45.132 --> 39:46.842
Yeah, it does.

39:48.052 --> 39:49.553
Who's the kid?

39:51.555 --> 39:53.099
That's me.

39:53.516 --> 39:55.935
I recognized the building.
Hillside at Lenox.

39:56.018 --> 39:58.729
St. Mel's Home for boys.
You were coming or going?

40:01.107 --> 40:02.274
It's going.

40:05.194 --> 40:06.487
Hmm.

40:11.033 --> 40:12.451
Okay.

40:38.853 --> 40:40.396
-I prefer Darjeeling.
-Okay.

40:40.479 --> 40:42.106
And you prefer talking to Pippy

40:42.189 --> 40:43.983
about things
that are happening in your life,

40:44.066 --> 40:46.777
but I kinda turned hers upside down

40:46.861 --> 40:51.240
and sent her to a hiding place
far, far away.

40:51.949 --> 40:54.034
Maybe a friend's house
down the street.

40:54.743 --> 40:56.245
Either way, my fault.

40:56.328 --> 40:58.164
Tara, listen to me--

40:58.247 --> 41:00.666
You have always been there for me
when I needed you.

41:00.749 --> 41:02.084
Shoulder to cry on,

41:02.418 --> 41:05.129
words of wisdom, you're my rock.

41:06.464 --> 41:07.756
And now I'm here to be yours.

41:08.466 --> 41:10.050
No matter what.

41:16.932 --> 41:18.184
Mmm!

41:18.267 --> 41:19.560
Oh, my God, that's terrible.

41:21.312 --> 41:22.813
-Tea?
-Mmm-hmm.

41:23.522 --> 41:24.982
Yes, please. Why did I do that?

41:26.901 --> 41:30.613
I'm making room
Inside my heart

41:31.071 --> 41:34.492
I'm moving on

41:35.117 --> 41:38.954
Look past the moon
Look past the stars

41:39.413 --> 41:43.959
I'm moving on
Moving on

42:00.392 --> 42:02.228
-Hey.
-Hey.

42:02.937 --> 42:05.064
-I was--
-You're not gonna let me in?

42:13.864 --> 42:15.616
-Villa...
-Please, don't.

42:36.679 --> 42:38.514
The two leads in your trash
are dead ends.

42:39.265 --> 42:40.724
That's everything I have so far.

42:41.433 --> 42:43.394
I'm gonna find out who killed Eddie.

42:43.477 --> 42:45.396
And I just want to say thank you

42:46.397 --> 42:48.649
for this, for what you've done.

42:48.732 --> 42:50.234
Because you know what? I...

42:52.152 --> 42:53.862
I may have never found out.

42:55.197 --> 42:57.116
But I don't want you
getting caught up--

42:57.199 --> 42:58.450
I'm in.

43:02.746 --> 43:04.582
I don't know what I'll do
when I catch them,

43:04.832 --> 43:05.666
and I can't have you--

43:05.749 --> 43:08.752
Villa, there's no way in hell
that I'm not with you on this one.

43:11.005 --> 43:12.381
Okay.

43:19.054 --> 43:21.473
-Let's get to work.
-Let's get to work.
