There are two gentlemen
here to see you.

02:42.702 --> 02:44.105
PATRICK:
You know, I really should be

02:44.171 --> 02:46.242
questioning her alone.

02:46.309 --> 02:49.415
Spare me the "I'm a cop
and you're not" lecture.

02:49.482 --> 02:52.121
Well, I'm more than just a cop,
Gino, I'm a detective.

02:52.187 --> 02:54.191
You're a detective,
I'm a reporter.

02:54.258 --> 02:55.595
We're both investigators, okay?

02:55.661 --> 02:57.297
-So, easy.
-(door opens)

02:57.364 --> 03:00.404
Hello, I'm Dr. Hannah Wells.
How may I help you?

03:00.470 --> 03:02.542
Hey, I'm Detective Read.
This is my friend Gino,

03:02.609 --> 03:05.648
-Gino Barelli. Downtown Native.
-from the, uh, Downtown Native.
That's...

03:05.715 --> 03:07.217
(clears throat)
We'd like to talk to you about

03:07.284 --> 03:08.554
the blood samples you took

03:08.621 --> 03:11.159
the night of The Ascension
bar firebombing.

03:12.094 --> 03:13.564
Look,

03:13.631 --> 03:15.568
we're not interested
in why you took those samples,

03:15.635 --> 03:17.739
okay, or whatever research
you're conducting here,

03:17.806 --> 03:19.576
but it's very possible
you took the blood

03:19.643 --> 03:21.045
of someone we're looking for.

03:21.112 --> 03:23.049
I'm afraid I can't
talk about that.

03:23.116 --> 03:25.287
-My research is confidential.
-You must've heard about

03:25.353 --> 03:27.559
the most recent murders
of gay men in this city.

03:27.625 --> 03:28.894
Of course.

03:28.961 --> 03:30.397
So, we feel that the killer

03:30.464 --> 03:31.934
was at St. Vincent's that night,

03:32.000 --> 03:33.537
and if you took his blood,
you might have his name

03:33.604 --> 03:35.006
-and information.
-I'm sorry,

03:35.073 --> 03:36.844
I wish I could help you.

03:36.910 --> 03:38.848
Why don't you just

03:38.914 --> 03:40.885
take a moment to look
through your records.

03:40.952 --> 03:42.889
I'm sure it
won't take that long.

03:42.956 --> 03:44.526
My time isn't the issue.

03:44.593 --> 03:46.028
I'd be betraying
patient confidentiality.

03:46.095 --> 03:47.398
PATRICK:
Yeah, I understand.

03:48.199 --> 03:50.772
Nobody needs to know
what we're talking about here.

03:50.838 --> 03:53.544
Okay?
And given the stakes,

03:53.611 --> 03:55.982
it's very likely
you could be saving lives.

03:56.048 --> 03:58.253
And you wouldn't be aiding
and abetting a murderer.

03:58.319 --> 03:59.790
We're done here.

03:59.856 --> 04:03.296
GINO:
This man preys
on the gay community.

04:03.363 --> 04:06.135
He butchers them.
He cuts them up.

04:06.202 --> 04:07.672
He slices off their heads,

04:07.739 --> 04:09.976
-their hands...
-HANNAH: This isn't an official

04:10.043 --> 04:11.680
investigation, is it?

04:11.747 --> 04:13.450
-What are you talking about?
-Detectives usually

04:13.517 --> 04:15.888
don't travel around
with reporters.

04:17.592 --> 04:19.228
The police in this city

04:19.295 --> 04:21.500
don't give a shit
about dead gay men,

04:21.567 --> 04:24.405
so we're looking into this
as private citizens.

04:26.409 --> 04:27.679
This is the man

04:27.745 --> 04:31.018
we're looking for.
Do you recognize him?

04:34.024 --> 04:35.495
That mark-- have you
had it checked out?

04:35.561 --> 04:37.197
I've seen similar discolorations

04:37.264 --> 04:38.934
in several of my patients.

04:39.001 --> 04:40.403
-Let me see.
-Gino.

04:40.470 --> 04:41.773
It's just... It's a bug bite.

04:41.840 --> 04:43.511
HANNAH:
If you two are partners,

04:43.577 --> 04:45.313
you both might want
to get checked out.

04:45.380 --> 04:47.251
I've only been seeing it
in gay men.

04:47.317 --> 04:50.423
Uh, all right, can we just
stick to the subject here?

04:50.491 --> 04:51.794
There's a killer at large.

04:51.860 --> 04:53.931
I've made myself clear.
No one cares more

04:53.998 --> 04:55.835
about the well-being
of your community than I do,

04:55.902 --> 04:58.239
and if you go about the proper
channels to obtain a warrant,

04:58.306 --> 04:59.676
I'd be happy to comply.

04:59.743 --> 05:01.580
In the meantime,

05:01.647 --> 05:04.986
consider making an appointment
for a checkup.

05:22.421 --> 05:23.624
Hey.

05:23.691 --> 05:25.026
-Yeah?
-MULCAHEY: I just got a call

05:25.093 --> 05:26.429
from the administrator

05:26.497 --> 05:27.765
over at St. Vincent's.
Said you were down there

05:27.832 --> 05:29.603
flashing a sketch
of the Mai Tai Killer.

05:29.669 --> 05:32.074
Yeah, just following up
on some questions I still have.

05:32.140 --> 05:34.646
Well, we told them that we were
done with all the interviews.

05:34.713 --> 05:36.015
They're starting to worry
if we think

05:36.082 --> 05:37.852
the killer might be
one of their staff.

05:37.919 --> 05:39.890
Then they're idiots 'cause
I didn't imply that at all.

05:39.956 --> 05:42.027
I don't have to explain
my moves to you, Mulcahey.

05:42.094 --> 05:43.497
Go back to your desk,

05:43.564 --> 05:46.603
carry on making ignorant
gay cracks behind my back, okay?

05:46.670 --> 05:48.674
-(sniffs)
-You know what?

05:48.741 --> 05:50.678
For somebody who always seems
to have the answers,

05:50.745 --> 05:52.916
you don't know jack shit.

05:54.886 --> 05:56.924
(phone rings)

06:02.034 --> 06:03.804
Detective Read.

06:03.871 --> 06:06.442
Detective, my name
is Frankie Del Rios.

06:06.510 --> 06:09.181
I live out on Fire Island.

06:09.248 --> 06:10.685
Okay.
What can I do for you?

06:10.751 --> 06:12.154
I was gonna call
the regular island police,

06:12.221 --> 06:13.958
but we heard
from a friend of a friend

06:14.024 --> 06:16.930
that you're different.
That you're one of us.

06:16.997 --> 06:18.767
Anyways, my friend and I,

06:18.834 --> 06:20.905
we found something
on the beach, Detective.

06:20.972 --> 06:22.842
It's a body.
It's been there for a while.

06:22.909 --> 06:26.249
Oh, and this guy is wearing
a black leather mask.

06:26.315 --> 06:27.885
-A leather mask?
-Yeah.

06:27.952 --> 06:29.623
It's on the north shore,
behind the house

06:29.689 --> 06:32.461
at 4 Seafront Drive.

06:35.233 --> 06:36.503
Have you told anyone about this?

06:36.570 --> 06:39.008
You're the first person
I called.

06:39.074 --> 06:40.310
Okay, good.

06:40.377 --> 06:41.647
Listen to me very carefully.

06:41.713 --> 06:43.617
Keep this to yourself,
understood?

06:44.953 --> 06:48.126
Easy, easy, easy. It's
a sculpture you're uncrating,

06:48.192 --> 06:50.831
not a Frigidaire.

06:50.898 --> 06:52.535
You know, you two
should thank me.

06:52.602 --> 06:54.405
Your tiny, little worldviews
are about to expand

06:54.471 --> 06:56.442
just by looking at it.

07:00.083 --> 07:02.187

07:05.226 --> 07:07.832
Gently, gently.

07:12.007 --> 07:12.875
Hello?

07:12.942 --> 07:14.746
Hello, Sam.
It's Patrick.

07:14.813 --> 07:16.950
We have a problem.

07:17.017 --> 07:18.286
Oh, wonderful.
Just when I thought

07:18.353 --> 07:19.756
I was running short on those.

07:19.823 --> 07:22.562
No, I'm serious.
Two guys found a body.

07:23.329 --> 07:24.966
On Fire Island.

07:35.286 --> 07:37.792
So, what are we doing out here?

07:37.859 --> 07:39.529
Why aren't we meeting
at the club?

07:39.596 --> 07:40.865
Front page.

07:42.535 --> 07:43.937
Fifth article this month
by this guy,

07:44.004 --> 07:47.645
shitting on the police.
He's stirring things up.

07:47.712 --> 07:49.916
And it's not just the fruits,

07:49.983 --> 07:52.087
regular people
are starting to talk.

07:52.154 --> 07:53.824
No offense.

07:54.592 --> 07:56.062
So, what do we care?

07:56.128 --> 07:57.130
We're not the police.

07:57.197 --> 07:59.669
But some of the police
are with us.

07:59.736 --> 08:01.172
Look, we need them to get
certain things done,

08:01.238 --> 08:03.042
you understand?
They're our friends.

08:03.109 --> 08:06.449
-You know how this works.
-Sure, Angelo.

08:06.516 --> 08:08.587
And now some of our friends

08:08.654 --> 08:10.691
have asked us to take care
of this problem.

08:10.758 --> 08:12.060
Quiet things down.

08:12.127 --> 08:13.831
Is that really necessary?

08:13.897 --> 08:15.400
(laughs)

08:15.467 --> 08:17.572
When the boss
says it's necessary,

08:17.638 --> 08:19.776
then it's fucking necessary.

08:19.843 --> 08:23.751
-Right.
-This falls on you.

08:23.817 --> 08:26.088
Look, we don't care how
you do it, but no showboating.

08:26.155 --> 08:29.028
We don't want anything found.
Just, uh...

08:29.094 --> 08:30.731
disappear this guy,

08:30.798 --> 08:33.904
make sure he's written
his last fucking article.

08:42.555 --> 08:45.661
Oh, Gino.

08:57.652 --> 08:59.956
-Where are you going?
-They found a body.

09:00.023 --> 09:03.296
Think it might be related
to the Mai Tai Killer

09:03.362 --> 09:04.766
on Fire Island.

09:04.833 --> 09:07.237
Fire Island? Why did...
Why are they calling you?

09:07.304 --> 09:08.640
Apparently, I'm the only cop

09:08.707 --> 09:10.678
gay enough to care.

09:10.745 --> 09:12.582
-Okay, well, I'll come with you.
-No.

09:12.648 --> 09:14.118
-No.
-No?

09:14.184 --> 09:16.222
No. I-I don't want to make
a whole scene of this.

09:16.288 --> 09:17.457
It's not my jurisdiction.

09:17.525 --> 09:19.496
I got to tread lightly.

09:19.562 --> 09:22.502
I'm... confused.
This is...

09:22.568 --> 09:24.471

spend the night?

09:24.539 --> 09:27.010

09:27.077 --> 09:28.947
Hopefully not.

09:29.014 --> 09:30.250

11:41.947 --> 11:43.750
with what you've
been writing in the Native.

11:43.817 --> 11:45.554
It's bringing
the wrong kind of attention

11:45.621 --> 11:48.527
to their establishments,
it's affecting the bottom line.

11:48.594 --> 11:51.065

You get rid of me...

12:05.828 --> 12:07.430

helping the killer.

12:07.498 --> 12:09.769
Ugh!
This obsession

12:09.836 --> 12:12.440
is unhealthy, Gino.
Get rid of it.

12:12.508 --> 12:15.113
He's already moved on to Fire
Island. They found a new body.

Can we see your badge, please?

12:47.444 --> 12:49.247
Sorry, I just figure
there's probably

12:49.314 --> 12:51.318
some kind of criminal exposure
for finding a body

12:51.385 --> 12:52.888
and not reporting it
to the cops.

12:52.955 --> 12:54.458
And the finger cut me.

12:54.525 --> 12:56.596
Do you think I could get
some sort of disease from that?

12:56.663 --> 12:59.334
No.
I wouldn't worry about it.

13:00.571 --> 13:02.875
Come on, we'll show you
where the body is.

13:02.942 --> 13:04.879

We can find it.

-Leave.

For your own security,

14:11.278 --> 14:13.617
-truly relaxed.
-That's probably a result

14:13.683 --> 14:16.088
of the drugs, Sam.

14:17.591 --> 14:19.061
What were we thinking,
burying him

14:19.127 --> 14:20.764
in a shallow sand dune, Patrick?

14:20.831 --> 14:22.501
Yet again...

14:23.870 --> 14:26.008
...probably the drugs.

14:52.695 --> 14:55.433
So, what do we do?

14:55.501 --> 14:57.505
We dig more.

14:57.571 --> 14:59.274
The remains we scattered
ought to be around here.

14:59.341 --> 15:01.111
We need to get those remains
in our bag

I haven't really thought
about that yet, okay?

15:15.774 --> 15:17.477
Hello, Sam.
I brought him.

15:17.545 --> 15:19.381
He wanted to know
about the killer.

15:19.448 --> 15:22.688
I just left out the part that
the killer was his boyfriend.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.828
The fuck is going on
here, Patrick?

15:25.894 --> 15:27.230
It's not what you think, Gino.

15:27.297 --> 15:28.633
-All right, tell him.
-PATRICK: Go home, Gino.

15:28.700 --> 15:30.804
I'll talk about this
when I get back. This has

15:30.871 --> 15:33.543
nothing to do with you.
You are not a part of this.

15:35.079 --> 15:37.885

15:37.952 --> 15:40.389
What is this,

15:40.456 --> 15:42.293
-(Patrick scoffs)
-Did you kill Barbara?

15:42.360 --> 15:44.164
No, we did not fucking kill
Barbara. I didn't kill anybody.

15:44.231 --> 15:46.636
This was a mistake, okay?
This was a freak accident,

15:46.703 --> 15:48.305
a horrible thing
that shouldn't have happened.

Sam scooped me up,

16:33.062 --> 16:35.366
fresh off the ferry,

16:35.433 --> 16:37.872
and that's when I met Billy.

16:37.938 --> 16:41.011
Billy was his name.

16:44.351 --> 16:46.523
I was married to Barbara,
but I lied to her.

16:46.589 --> 16:48.793
I told her I was working
on a stakeout,

16:48.860 --> 16:52.535
but I went to the island
so I could be myself.

17:01.519 --> 17:05.393
Billy was fresh off the bus.
I can't remember where from,

17:05.459 --> 17:08.132

that kept him bottled up.

30:20.650 --> 30:22.419
I've seen his face.

30:22.486 --> 30:24.591
I can ID him.

30:24.658 --> 30:25.827
You take me to him.

30:25.893 --> 30:27.062
What are you
talking about, Gino?

30:27.129 --> 30:29.200
He would recognize you
right away.

30:29.266 --> 30:31.905
(sighs) Well, it's amazing
that Scooby-Doo here

30:31.972 --> 30:33.308
has solved the crime,
but before we all

30:33.375 --> 30:35.178
pile into the Mystery Machine,
can we please

30:35.245 --> 30:38.485
deal with the issue at hand?

30:39.253 --> 30:41.692
-Henry and I will go on our own.
-Oh, fuck that. Fuck...

30:41.759 --> 30:43.228
Gino, please.

30:43.294 --> 30:44.798
If I had an ounce of integrity,

30:44.865 --> 30:46.668
I'd turn your fucking ass in.

30:46.735 --> 30:49.106
Gino, wait. Wait.

30:52.580 --> 30:53.582
Take this.

30:53.649 --> 30:56.020
Please.

31:18.666 --> 31:21.037
ng)
-(scoffs)

31:23.743 --> 31:26.782
(phone rings)

31:26.849 --> 31:28.318
WHITELY:
If you've reached this,

31:28.384 --> 31:30.790
I am either unavailable
or at my office.

31:30.857 --> 31:32.594
-Please leave a message.
-(beep)

31:38.806 --> 31:41.444
(phone ringing)

31:45.419 --> 31:46.287
Hello?

31:46.354 --> 31:49.093
Mr. Whitely.
It's Henry.

31:49.160 --> 31:50.963
I've got another job for us.

31:51.030 --> 31:53.268
Henry.
This really isn't

31:53.334 --> 31:55.005
-the best time for me.
-(scoffs)

31:55.071 --> 31:57.710
Well, is it ever a good time
when I call?

31:57.777 --> 31:59.581
The boss has a mess

31:59.648 --> 32:02.252
-he needs us to clean up ASAP.
-I'm sorry,

32:02.319 --> 32:04.356
but I just can't do that
right now, unfortunately.

32:04.423 --> 32:05.993
Well, you know
we really don't have a choice

32:06.060 --> 32:07.530
in these matters, Whitely.

32:11.070 --> 32:13.475
Okay.
Where's the location?

32:13.542 --> 32:15.145
Um...

32:15.212 --> 32:18.619
I'm afraid I can't
give that to you.

32:18.686 --> 32:19.988
I'll pick you up.

32:20.055 --> 32:22.159
I'll just need an address.

32:22.226 --> 32:23.929
An address?

32:23.996 --> 32:25.232
I'm going to be out and about.

32:25.298 --> 32:28.772
How about we meet
at Malty's bar, 9:00 p. m.

32:28.839 --> 32:30.075
Sure.

32:30.142 --> 32:32.179
-See you soon.
-(hangs up)

32:37.322 --> 32:38.793
He knows something's up.

32:38.859 --> 32:40.028
What are you talking about?

32:40.095 --> 32:42.734
Change of plans.

32:42.801 --> 32:43.836
You're gonna ID him.

32:43.903 --> 32:45.740
If he's the Mai Tai killer,

32:45.807 --> 32:47.476
we take him out, then and there.

32:47.544 --> 32:48.478
(scoffs)

32:48.546 --> 32:51.184
Absolutely not, Henry.
No.

32:51.250 --> 32:53.454
I'll lure him
from the bar into the car,

32:53.522 --> 32:55.258
where you'll be waiting
in the back seat with a gun.

32:55.325 --> 32:56.829
-I'm not killing anyone.
-No,

32:56.895 --> 32:59.066
you just hold him at gunpoint.
We'll drive to the docks

32:59.133 --> 33:01.103
and I'll finish him off.

33:03.709 --> 33:06.280
You want to stop these killings,
isn't that right?

33:06.347 --> 33:08.251
Well, moral clarity's
a whole lot easier

33:08.318 --> 33:09.721
when you're sitting
behind a typewriter.

33:09.788 --> 33:11.959
We're doing this, Gino,

33:12.025 --> 33:14.263
and we're going it tonight.

33:16.635 --> 33:18.104
(engine starts)

33:18.873 --> 33:20.543
(thud)

33:28.291 --> 33:30.095
HENRY:
Well, that's his Buick.

33:30.161 --> 33:32.700
That's good.
Looks like he's inside already.

33:32.767 --> 33:35.171
GINO:
You do realize that this
is fucking insane, right?

33:35.238 --> 33:36.407
HENRY:
Gino,

33:36.474 --> 33:38.211
you just duck down
in the back seat,

33:38.278 --> 33:40.850
make sure nobody sees you,

33:40.917 --> 33:42.987
keep your finger on the trigger,

33:43.054 --> 33:46.762
and I will be back in five.

33:56.748 --> 33:59.019
(entry bells jingle)

34:01.057 --> 34:03.328
(door closes)

34:05.600 --> 34:07.604
Mr. Whitely.

34:07.670 --> 34:08.606
Henry.

34:08.672 --> 34:11.578
-Thank you for meeting here.
-Mm.

34:11.645 --> 34:14.818
I thought we could catch up
over a drink before we head out.

34:19.193 --> 34:21.732
I'll have a whiskey.

34:35.292 --> 34:36.662
-So, what's the job?
-Oh,

34:36.728 --> 34:39.734
couple of deadbeats
didn't pay their loan.

34:39.801 --> 34:43.709
Demarco is whacking people
over bad loans now?

34:43.776 --> 34:45.913
What happened to a lean?

34:45.980 --> 34:48.117
Maybe it's a big loan.

34:48.184 --> 34:50.790
It's none of my business,
nor yours.

34:58.939 --> 35:01.243
We should get going.

35:03.114 --> 35:04.985
Mind if I use the john first?

35:05.051 --> 35:07.790
You've never
needed my permission.

35:16.273 --> 35:20.415
(bathroom door opens, closes)

35:24.123 --> 35:26.394
♪♪ ♪♪

35:51.210 --> 35:53.281
Fuck.

36:14.123 --> 36:16.394
(grunting)

36:23.341 --> 36:27.215
Oh... Oh...

36:29.053 --> 36:31.357
(groaning)

36:33.227 --> 36:36.300
My buddy can't
handle his liquor.

36:36.367 --> 36:37.335
Come on, buddy.

36:37.402 --> 36:38.839
Let's get you home.

36:38.906 --> 36:41.277
Get you to bed,
where you can sleep peacefully.

36:41.343 --> 36:44.283
-(door opens)
-(entry bells jingle)

36:46.220 --> 36:47.890
(car door opens)

36:49.861 --> 36:51.498
(car door closes)

37:00.315 --> 37:02.285
(engine starts)

37:02.352 --> 37:04.223
(car departs)

37:27.870 --> 37:29.941
(engine stops)

37:48.946 --> 37:50.983
-PATRICK: Hello?
-Patrick, the killer has Henry.

37:51.050 --> 37:52.753
Wh-What? Gino...

37:52.820 --> 37:54.389
I need you.
