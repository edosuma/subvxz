WEBVTT

00:17.309 --> 00:19.562
Previously on Beacon 23.

00:19.603 --> 00:21.313
[Halan] In case you're wondering
why I don't look like Solomon,

00:21.397 --> 00:23.733
that's 'cause I'm not Solomon.
My name is Halan.

00:23.816 --> 00:25.901
The real Solomon
stole my ship and left.

00:25.985 --> 00:27.445
[grunting]

00:28.738 --> 00:30.740
-Who the hell are you?
-I work for ISA.

00:30.823 --> 00:32.158
Well, he knows
who we work for, Coley.

00:32.241 --> 00:33.617
I know Coley's a hard-ass,

00:33.701 --> 00:36.078
but I'll make sure
you're coming with us.

00:36.162 --> 00:37.913
What's that condition
soldiers get?

00:37.997 --> 00:39.832
Hallucinations, headaches...

00:39.915 --> 00:41.417
Post-Traumatic
Stress Disorder.

00:41.500 --> 00:43.836
-The samples trigger it.
-Why'd you go AWOL?

00:43.919 --> 00:46.422
-I don't know, it's all a blur.
-How you ran.

00:46.505 --> 00:47.757
Leaving your squad.

00:47.840 --> 00:49.258
Most of them are dead
because of you.

00:49.341 --> 00:50.760
[Halan]
Me and Gashade go way back.

00:50.843 --> 00:51.927
[Coley] You are a traitor.

00:52.011 --> 00:53.262
-[knife stabbing]
-[grunts]

00:53.345 --> 00:55.431
[groaning]

00:55.514 --> 00:58.309
[gasping]
Shh.

01:00.853 --> 01:01.812
[inhaling sharply]

01:06.025 --> 01:08.486
[theme music]

01:53.614 --> 01:55.157
[sighing]

01:55.241 --> 01:56.700
[Halan] I've been looking
all over for you.

02:01.288 --> 02:03.207
I took care of Coley's body.

02:03.290 --> 02:05.251
Thanks.

02:05.334 --> 02:07.753
You had my back.
I appreciate that.

02:07.837 --> 02:10.422
Well, I'm not sure
I did it for you.

02:10.506 --> 02:12.383
[sighing]
Then who?

02:14.426 --> 02:18.347
Look, I'm... I'm sorry I'm not
the guy to go to for answers.

02:18.430 --> 02:19.431
No?

02:21.517 --> 02:23.185
She was part of an old life.

02:23.269 --> 02:24.895
But still, you'd think
I'd feel something.

02:26.939 --> 02:30.234
I was more narked killing
Wally the Wanker.

02:36.115 --> 02:37.992
She was my friend, I think.

02:39.869 --> 02:41.245
I don't know what to think.

02:46.041 --> 02:47.501
You coming?

02:49.461 --> 02:50.754
I'll be fine.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.298
I mean, where am I gonna go?

02:59.138 --> 03:01.307
[footsteps receding]

03:03.475 --> 03:06.270
Let me offer
a plausible explanation.

03:06.353 --> 03:08.939
You killed Coley
in self-defense.

03:09.023 --> 03:11.901
Coley was jealous.
She became violent.

03:11.984 --> 03:14.069
And it endangered the mission.

03:14.153 --> 03:17.406
QTA's inquiry will accept
this explanation.

03:17.489 --> 03:18.782
[chuckles]

03:20.868 --> 03:22.828
I'm not going back to QTA.

03:24.997 --> 03:26.832
You're willing
to throw away everything

03:26.916 --> 03:28.959
-that you've built for yourself?
-Well, I already have.

03:40.012 --> 03:41.764
She must've carried it
everywhere she went.

03:41.847 --> 03:43.599
I think that's a bit weird.

03:43.682 --> 03:46.435
I find your lack of remorse
disturbing.

03:46.518 --> 03:48.103
Well, you don't have
to watch, Harmony.

03:48.187 --> 03:49.980
I know the turmoil you feel.

03:50.064 --> 03:52.483
What disturbs me is your
unwillingness to display it.

03:52.566 --> 03:54.485
Now you're channeling
your feelings

03:54.567 --> 03:56.946
into some course of action
I don't understand.

03:57.029 --> 03:59.281
You might need that, Aster.

03:59.365 --> 04:01.951
It's an advanced military grade
combat suit

04:02.034 --> 04:03.994
with embedded nerve rigs.

04:04.078 --> 04:07.164
Coley and Halan's fight
is recorded in its fibers.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.791
It speaks to her state of mind.

04:08.874 --> 04:10.209
You can use it
to support your case.

04:10.292 --> 04:11.835
How detailed is it?

04:11.919 --> 04:14.797
Video, sound, vitals,
numerous biometric indicators...

04:14.880 --> 04:16.255
This is my point.

04:23.222 --> 04:25.182
Same tech as Coley's suit, yeah?

04:25.265 --> 04:26.892
It's military standard.

04:26.976 --> 04:29.561
I have the codecs...
unofficially.

04:29.645 --> 04:32.731
Can you show me the raw feed
from his last mission?

04:43.075 --> 04:45.452
[Halan] Copy that, Cap.
Laurenzano, one click north.

04:58.966 --> 05:01.385
[whirring]

05:18.527 --> 05:20.237
Gashade, with me!

05:20.320 --> 05:22.906
[firearm shooting in video]

05:25.451 --> 05:28.412
-[woman] Roger that, Sarge!
-[Halan] That's Gashade.

05:33.167 --> 05:34.918
What is this?

05:35.002 --> 05:38.255
-Uh, Harmony...
-Is that from my suit?

05:38.338 --> 05:39.590
You mean the whole time
I've been here,

05:39.673 --> 05:41.300
I could've accessed these files?

05:41.383 --> 05:42.718
[Harmony] The raw feeds
wouldn't show you anything.

05:42.801 --> 05:44.219
You need an AI
to collate the data.

05:44.303 --> 05:45.721
Of course. Bart.

05:45.804 --> 05:46.930
[Harmony]
Bart doesn't have clearance

05:47.014 --> 05:48.599
for classified material.

05:48.682 --> 05:51.935
I was able to access it
through Aster's ISA clearance.

05:52.019 --> 05:55.064
Your mission on DX 113 was
considered a failure because--

05:55.147 --> 05:56.648
I already know what happened.

05:56.732 --> 05:58.734
Do you think the military
reports were accurate?

05:58.817 --> 06:00.819
I don't know.

06:00.903 --> 06:02.446
You went blank.

06:02.529 --> 06:03.947
That's what you said
about your hallucinations.

06:04.031 --> 06:06.283
-Did I?
-Yeah.

06:06.366 --> 06:07.826
Do you want to know
what happened to you or not?

06:09.703 --> 06:11.080
[sighing]

06:11.163 --> 06:12.331
Harm?

06:13.832 --> 06:16.251
[video continues playing]

06:16.335 --> 06:18.295
What if they're not
hallucinations?

06:18.378 --> 06:20.297
What if they're trying
to tell you something?

06:20.380 --> 06:22.174
[Halan]
LT wants us pounding ground.

06:22.257 --> 06:23.467
That's what we're doing.

06:23.550 --> 06:25.260
[grunts]
Damn hornet's nest!

06:25.344 --> 06:26.303
Recon was shit.

06:28.180 --> 06:29.348
Let's move out.

06:32.851 --> 06:33.727
Gashade!

06:35.229 --> 06:36.855
[grunting]

06:38.857 --> 06:41.193
-I got you.
-[coughing] Sarge!

06:41.276 --> 06:43.153
That's the last thing
I remember.

06:52.704 --> 06:55.165
-What is that?
-I don't know.

07:04.383 --> 07:06.009
That's the same blue
as our rock.

07:09.221 --> 07:10.347
Are you seeing this?

07:17.104 --> 07:18.689
Oh my God,
you breathed that in.

07:20.149 --> 07:21.817
I just don't remember running.

07:21.900 --> 07:23.360
You didn't run,
it brought you here.

07:24.736 --> 07:27.156
-[sighing]
-[computer beeping]

07:27.239 --> 07:29.074
[Halan]
That's not from the beacon.

07:29.158 --> 07:30.325
[Harmony]
It's from Coley's ship.

07:30.409 --> 07:31.994
A message from QTA.

07:32.077 --> 07:34.538
They haven't heard from her,
second team is en route.

07:34.621 --> 07:36.665
Coley's expected to remain
in place until they arrive.

07:36.748 --> 07:39.168
Huh, at least that
shouldn't be a problem.

07:39.251 --> 07:40.544
Really?

07:40.627 --> 07:42.754
Sorry, just trying
to lighten the mood.

07:42.838 --> 07:44.256
We need to talk, you and me.

07:44.339 --> 07:45.674
[Halan] Dark matter
will hold 'em, but not for long.

07:45.757 --> 07:46.842
[Harmony]
It'll clear in 14 hours.

07:46.925 --> 07:49.511
We need to run.
Take the samples.

07:49.595 --> 07:51.346
-No!
-Even if we can't travel at FTL,

07:51.430 --> 07:52.514
it'll give us a head start.

07:52.598 --> 07:54.057
That is the least safe option.

07:54.141 --> 07:55.350
QTA will hunt you down.

07:55.433 --> 07:56.852
-[chuckling]
-I can fly Coley's ship,

07:56.935 --> 07:59.021
keep us on the run,
but for how long, I don't know.

07:59.104 --> 08:01.398
-Can you get us onboard?
-I can.

08:01.481 --> 08:04.276
[tense music]

08:33.639 --> 08:34.597
[grunting]

08:39.977 --> 08:41.438
[eerie music]

08:41.520 --> 08:44.274
[whispers echoing]

08:45.901 --> 08:48.153
[voices echoing]

08:52.532 --> 08:53.700
[grunts]

09:00.499 --> 09:02.292
[moans]

09:03.502 --> 09:04.836
Aster, you there?

09:07.422 --> 09:08.924
[woman whispering]
Halan...

09:09.007 --> 09:10.467
Aster?!

09:12.844 --> 09:15.180
Aster, where are you?

09:15.264 --> 09:17.266
-[whispers echoing] Halan...
-Harmony? Bart? Anyone?

09:17.349 --> 09:20.686
[panting]

09:20.769 --> 09:22.604
[woman whispering]
Come up.

09:22.688 --> 09:24.439
Aster, was that you?

09:24.523 --> 09:25.482
[woman]
The Cupola.

09:29.611 --> 09:31.655
I'm waiting.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.660
Aster?

09:36.743 --> 09:38.745
[indistinct whispering]

09:43.750 --> 09:46.795
Hey, Sarge, been a while.

09:46.878 --> 09:49.673
-Gashade?
-Isn't it beautiful?

09:49.756 --> 09:52.301
I've never seen this side
of Orion before.

09:52.384 --> 09:54.720
-Feels familiar.
-Wait... wait.

09:54.803 --> 09:56.138
Didn't Aster say that?

09:56.221 --> 09:58.140
I don't understand.

09:58.223 --> 09:59.683
It's simple.

09:59.766 --> 10:02.644
-I'm here to help.
-Help?

10:02.728 --> 10:03.895
But you're dead.

10:12.154 --> 10:14.698
You know what the last thought
I had was before I died?

10:16.283 --> 10:18.368
"He must have left us
for a reason."

10:18.452 --> 10:21.913
[sighing]
I'm sorry I abandoned you.

10:21.997 --> 10:25.167
You had something else to do.
There was a reason.

10:25.250 --> 10:28.086
Sarge, wait!

10:28.170 --> 10:31.381
There are things you need to do.
Important things.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.226
[ominous music]

10:47.647 --> 10:49.524
Do you have something
to tell me?

10:49.608 --> 10:51.401
I do.

10:51.485 --> 10:52.944
I'm listening.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.530
Are you?

10:55.614 --> 10:57.115
I hope so.

11:01.495 --> 11:02.954
It's very simple, Halan.

11:03.038 --> 11:05.207
[gibberish]

11:05.290 --> 11:07.542
Say that again.

11:07.626 --> 11:09.961
[gibberish continues]

11:12.839 --> 11:14.633
I don't know
what you're saying.

11:16.885 --> 11:18.261
Why won't you listen?

11:22.849 --> 11:25.227
[panting]

11:25.310 --> 11:27.062
Wake up.

11:27.145 --> 11:29.773
[gruff voice] It's like
she said, she's here to help.

11:38.323 --> 11:40.242
Who is that?

11:40.325 --> 11:42.160
[gruff voice]
You know me, Halan.

11:42.244 --> 11:43.995
Or did you forget?

11:44.079 --> 11:46.456
After all we've been through?

11:46.540 --> 11:47.958
We're brothers in arms.

11:53.004 --> 11:54.965
I was there
with you and Gashade.

12:00.762 --> 12:02.431
You gotta be kidding me.

12:02.514 --> 12:04.141
[gruff voice]
What she's saying is true.

12:06.685 --> 12:08.353
[scoffs]

12:08.437 --> 12:11.690
Goddamn hallucinations.

12:11.773 --> 12:13.358
[gruff voice]
I'm telling you, I was there.

12:16.862 --> 12:19.948
Hey, hear her out.
It's for your own good.

12:20.031 --> 12:22.117
I'm getting advice
from a rock.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.369
Why not?
I've been around a long time.

12:24.453 --> 12:25.912
I know things.

12:30.542 --> 12:31.668
You're not making any sense.

12:31.751 --> 12:34.129
[voices echoing]

12:34.212 --> 12:35.755
What do you want from me?

12:37.716 --> 12:39.342
I don't need any friends,

12:39.426 --> 12:40.886
I need to know what
they're trying to tell me!

12:40.969 --> 12:43.138
Just tell me!
Come on!

12:43.221 --> 12:44.806
[voices echoing]

12:44.890 --> 12:46.558
What am I supposed to do?

12:46.641 --> 12:48.310
It's all about the rocks.

12:48.393 --> 12:50.479
Ask Aster.
She knows.

12:50.562 --> 12:52.689
-Aster?
-[Harmony] She's in the Cupola.

12:55.066 --> 12:56.610
Aster?

12:58.403 --> 12:59.738
Aster?

13:10.248 --> 13:12.626
[panting]

13:16.421 --> 13:19.341
Bart, open this door right now.
You hear me?!

13:19.424 --> 13:20.967
Open the goddamn door!

13:24.012 --> 13:25.430
[alarm blaring]

13:25.514 --> 13:27.265
You said we had 14 hours!

13:27.349 --> 13:28.683
[Harmony] Bart has opened
the Picker Bay doors.

13:28.767 --> 13:29.643
Halan is outside.

13:33.104 --> 13:36.066
Aster, his implants allow him to
be out there for three minutes.

13:36.149 --> 13:37.734
He's been out there
for almost two.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.402
[alarm continues]

13:43.281 --> 13:45.492
[tense music]

14:00.006 --> 14:01.591
Harm, bring us in.

14:06.012 --> 14:08.473
[Aster panting]

14:14.062 --> 14:16.481
[beeping steadily]

14:22.696 --> 14:24.114
[moans]

14:28.034 --> 14:28.994
Hey.

14:30.245 --> 14:31.454
What happened?

14:33.081 --> 14:34.583
I thought you were dead.

14:34.665 --> 14:37.419
Me? You went out there
totally exposed.

14:37.502 --> 14:39.462
I was hallucinating.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.674
I had to be,
I was talking to Gashade.

14:42.757 --> 14:45.510
What did she say?

14:45.594 --> 14:46.761
Kept trying
to tell me something,

14:46.845 --> 14:48.597
but I couldn't get it.

14:48.680 --> 14:49.848
Even Rocky knew.

14:49.931 --> 14:51.975
Who's Rocky?
Another soldier?

14:52.058 --> 14:54.477
No. A rock.

14:54.561 --> 14:55.770
Talking rock?

14:55.854 --> 14:57.522
Yeah, with a shitty
sense of humor.

14:59.024 --> 15:01.318
-You look like you believe me.
-Why not?

15:01.401 --> 15:03.778
-Because it's insane.
-Well, I don't think it is.

15:03.862 --> 15:05.363
They're trying
to tell us something,

15:05.447 --> 15:06.865
we have to figure it out.

15:06.948 --> 15:08.825
Yeah, and hope they don't
kill me in the process.

15:10.535 --> 15:12.996
The rocks aren't trying
to kill you, Halan.

15:14.205 --> 15:15.206
Bart!

15:17.208 --> 15:18.418
[whistles]

15:20.378 --> 15:22.005
There's something
I need to show you.

15:25.216 --> 15:26.343
[sighing]

15:28.887 --> 15:30.305
What is it?

15:30.388 --> 15:32.307
I can't give
a definitive diagnosis,

15:32.390 --> 15:34.017
but it behaves like a virus.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.852
You think whatever
he inhaled caused it?

15:35.935 --> 15:37.687
I think it's a fair assumption.

15:37.771 --> 15:39.689
If you follow its path
through the lobes of the brain,

15:39.773 --> 15:41.650
it explains his hallucinations.

15:41.733 --> 15:45.320
Amygdala triggered, making him
think someone's behind him.

15:45.403 --> 15:46.863
Well, the rocks were trying
to tell him something.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.198
So was Gashade.

15:48.281 --> 15:49.741
Do you want me
to play that back for you?

15:49.824 --> 15:52.535
-No.
-It's a virus, Aster.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.621
That's the only answer.

15:55.664 --> 15:57.999
Couldn't the virus be trying
to convey something?

15:58.083 --> 15:59.334
You are so desperate
to believe

15:59.417 --> 16:01.419
that there's some
greater purpose in this,

16:01.503 --> 16:05.173
but you need to face reality.
Halan is sick.

16:05.256 --> 16:07.592
Coley is dead.
QTA is coming.

16:07.676 --> 16:09.010
You need to think about
what you're gonna say

16:09.094 --> 16:11.554
when they arrive,
how best to position yourself.

16:12.681 --> 16:15.350
So, if this is all a bad dream,
I killed Coley for nothing.

16:15.433 --> 16:17.227
-Is that what you're saying?
-No, because of the silicate.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.688
This is the clear path, Aster.

16:19.771 --> 16:21.189
They will believe
that explanation.

16:21.272 --> 16:23.274
Yeah, but I won't.
I know what I did.

16:24.693 --> 16:26.277
I'm not going back to QTA.

16:27.696 --> 16:30.198
-What about Halan?
-[sighing]

16:30.281 --> 16:33.535
QTA might be his only chance of
reconciling with the military.

16:33.618 --> 16:35.412
I mean, you claim
to care about him.

16:37.163 --> 16:40.083
-You know I'm right.
-Yeah, you're always right.

16:43.461 --> 16:45.380
[Bart] You're taking away
my permissions.

16:45.463 --> 16:47.090
You can't do that.

16:47.173 --> 16:48.883
You tried to kill Halan.

16:48.967 --> 16:52.095
I did no such thing.
I followed a direct order.

16:52.178 --> 16:54.431
-From Halan.
-You knew it was wrong.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.766
-Harmony, take over.
-[Bart] What?

16:56.850 --> 17:00.603
I am not a killer.
Halan killed Solomon.

17:00.687 --> 17:03.273
Let me tell you,
I have quite the story.

17:05.066 --> 17:06.776
Solomon found
the silicate samples

17:06.859 --> 17:08.653
in the beacon's
immediate vicinity.

17:08.737 --> 17:12.906
He collected and catalogued his
findings in painstaking detail.

17:12.991 --> 17:15.285
His isolation allowed him
to work on his discovery

17:15.367 --> 17:17.996
before affirming it
to the scientific community.

17:20.707 --> 17:22.916
Halan's arrival
threatened that process.

17:23.001 --> 17:24.627
How so?

17:26.337 --> 17:27.839
See for yourself.

17:56.534 --> 17:59.287
The instructions specify
204 degrees.

17:59.370 --> 18:04.626
Yes, if I wanted
a squishy, flaccid crust,

18:04.709 --> 18:08.505
I would cook it at 204 degrees.
But I do not.

18:10.548 --> 18:13.968
Ah, please.
Get your drone away from me.

18:14.052 --> 18:16.387
[Bart] I'm only concerned
it will char.

18:16.471 --> 18:18.723
It won't char, you nitwit.

18:18.807 --> 18:21.768
It will have a hard crust.

18:23.436 --> 18:26.022
A bewitching counterpoint
to the silky softness

18:26.105 --> 18:30.151
of the bread as it melts...

18:30.235 --> 18:32.195
[sniffing]
...on the tongue.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.824
[grunts]

18:35.907 --> 18:37.492
Comme ça.

18:37.575 --> 18:40.203
-[beeping]
-Ah!

18:40.286 --> 18:43.706
Radiation levels have dropped.
Yeah.

18:45.250 --> 18:49.379
Perhaps a space walk
after I dine.

18:51.422 --> 18:53.883
[whirring]

19:12.861 --> 19:14.237
[Bart] You must know
you can trust me.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.246
Why write in a journal

19:23.329 --> 19:25.874
when I can digitally archive
all your data?

19:25.957 --> 19:29.210
Someday,
a budding mineralogist

19:29.294 --> 19:31.421
will sleep with this notebook
beneath their pillow.

19:32.797 --> 19:35.049
-[alarm buzzing]
-[Bart] This is unusual.

19:35.133 --> 19:38.928
UGMC Speed Launch in distress.
The Amboyna.

19:39.012 --> 19:41.639
No flight plan, but the pilot
is requesting aid.

19:41.723 --> 19:43.975
-No.
-Solomon, the ship

19:44.058 --> 19:46.728
has a United Galactic
Military Command charter.

19:46.811 --> 19:48.396
Tell them the security drones

19:48.479 --> 19:50.106
will obliterate them
if they approach.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.233
The drones are programmed
to stand down

19:52.317 --> 19:53.902
-in this situation.
-[sighing]

19:53.985 --> 19:55.653
[pilot]
Beacon 23, this is Amboyna.

19:55.737 --> 19:57.280
My O2's at 6%.

19:57.363 --> 19:58.948
Requesting permission
to dock and resupply.

20:00.241 --> 20:01.743
Didn't you tell them no?

20:01.826 --> 20:03.828
[Bart] His life support
is at critical levels.

20:03.912 --> 20:06.664
[sighing]
Why is this person here?

20:06.748 --> 20:08.249
I don't know.

20:08.333 --> 20:10.627
There aren't any combat zones
in this sector.

20:10.710 --> 20:14.297
[pilot] Repeat, this is
the UGMC Amboyna, O2 critical.

20:14.380 --> 20:17.258
[Bart] ISA regulations
require us to provide aid.

20:17.342 --> 20:18.927
-Opening Airlock Two.
-No!

20:19.010 --> 20:20.762
-Override!
-[Bart] Solomon, you cannot.

20:20.845 --> 20:23.181
Yes, I can.

20:23.264 --> 20:26.601
He has enough fuel to make it
to Winnecke 4, send him there.

20:26.684 --> 20:29.771
Interstellar Space Authority
regulations explicitly state--

20:29.854 --> 20:31.940
[pounding]
I am Beacon 23!

20:32.023 --> 20:34.984
And I say permission denied.

20:40.031 --> 20:43.326
Heat the water.
I must bathe now.

20:45.536 --> 20:50.458
[classical music playing]

20:50.541 --> 20:53.127
[Bart]
Amboyna, this is Beacon 23.

20:53.211 --> 20:55.672
Sending coordinates for
Winnecke 4 supply station.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.632
[pilot]
I won't make it.

20:57.715 --> 20:59.801
[Bart]
I recommend immediate departure.

20:59.884 --> 21:01.886
Do you copy, Amboyna?

21:01.970 --> 21:03.513
[pilot]
Acknowledged.

21:06.891 --> 21:10.353
[operatic singing
in foreign language]

21:33.126 --> 21:36.796
[continues singing]

21:43.761 --> 21:47.473
[singing echoing]

21:58.151 --> 22:01.738
[continues singing]

22:14.042 --> 22:16.127
[breathing heavily]

22:17.837 --> 22:19.338
[screaming]

22:21.132 --> 22:24.761
Here, we have
a ricotta ravioli,

22:24.844 --> 22:28.056
with pesto sauce
and blood orange foam.

22:28.139 --> 22:30.808
Cooked for exactly
four minutes, al dente.

22:30.892 --> 22:32.852
[chuckling]
Enjoy.

22:41.152 --> 22:44.572
-Tastes like shit.
-Hmm. You sure?

22:44.655 --> 22:46.908
Perhaps there's some way I can--

22:46.991 --> 22:49.077
Oh, condiments, of course!
[chuckles]

22:49.160 --> 22:50.328
I have many
wonderful condiments.

22:50.411 --> 22:51.954
Uh, let me introduce you to...

22:52.038 --> 22:55.166
That one is traditionally
brewed soy sauce,

22:55.249 --> 22:57.418
made from unprocessed soybeans

22:57.502 --> 23:00.088
and wheat derived
from original Saga cultivars.

23:00.171 --> 23:01.589
I waited years to receive it.

23:01.672 --> 23:05.301
So perhaps you should be
a little... frugal.

23:08.679 --> 23:09.806
Hmm.

23:14.185 --> 23:16.020
-At least the sauce is good.
-Good.

23:16.104 --> 23:17.605
I... I'm so happy.

23:17.688 --> 23:19.690
-Let me go ahead and...
-Got any water?

23:19.774 --> 23:21.442
...leave that right
there for you.

23:21.526 --> 23:23.528
Yes, of course.
Water right away.

23:23.611 --> 23:25.321
-H2O on the go.
-With ice.

23:47.218 --> 23:48.427
[moans]

24:03.317 --> 24:05.528
[chirping, whirring loudly]

24:35.141 --> 24:37.226
[breathing heavily]

24:48.154 --> 24:49.739
[gasps]

24:49.822 --> 24:51.490
I don't trust you.

24:54.035 --> 24:55.703
From now on, all communications
go through me.

24:55.786 --> 24:57.663
-You understand?
-Yes. Yes.

25:03.127 --> 25:05.213
-Get the hell out of here.
-Yeah, yeah.

25:05.296 --> 25:07.632
[alarm blaring]

25:09.634 --> 25:11.552
-What the hell is going on?
-You tell me, Halan,

25:11.636 --> 25:13.054
you're in charge
of the beacon now.

25:13.137 --> 25:14.472
Bart, what's up
with the alarm?

25:14.555 --> 25:16.265
[Bart] My name is Bartholomew,
not Bart.

25:16.349 --> 25:18.768
The GWB has been turned off,
there's no signal.

25:18.851 --> 25:20.311
Are the lanes obstructed?

25:20.394 --> 25:22.271
No, but there are
two incoming ships.

25:22.355 --> 25:25.233
-Shut up, Bart.
-If the GWB remains off,

25:25.316 --> 25:26.734
they'll be forced
to come out of FTL.

25:26.817 --> 25:29.111
-I said shut up.
-Show me the map.

25:34.408 --> 25:36.285
Okay, supply ship.

25:38.704 --> 25:41.666
Corporate transport.
QTA bigwigs, I bet.

25:43.209 --> 25:44.418
The lanes are clear,
turn it on.

25:44.502 --> 25:46.420
Once the GWB is turned off,

25:46.504 --> 25:48.089
AI control
must be re-engaged.

25:48.172 --> 25:50.174
That QTA ship, who cares?

25:50.258 --> 25:51.759
If that supplier
comes out of FTL,

25:51.842 --> 25:53.427
it'll take over a year.
People will die.

25:53.511 --> 25:55.346
Yeah that'll get
ISA's attention, won't it?

25:55.429 --> 25:56.931
Solomon, please.

25:57.014 --> 25:58.599
Not a word, Bart,
or I'll hobble you.

25:58.683 --> 26:00.351
Where are you going?

26:00.434 --> 26:02.478
The supply ship will start
deceleration in 25 seconds.

26:02.561 --> 26:04.272
No, wait, you have
no business touching that.

26:04.355 --> 26:05.648
Shut up.

26:05.731 --> 26:08.484
[chuckling]
That... that top... No!

26:08.567 --> 26:10.444
You're just guessing now.
You're just guessing.

26:10.528 --> 26:11.779
-Don't!
-Then tell me.

26:11.862 --> 26:15.366
-[grunting]
-Halan, the lever above you.

26:15.449 --> 26:18.828
[groans]
Bart! You traitorous dog!

26:18.911 --> 26:22.123
You ruined everything!
I was going to be rescued!

26:22.206 --> 26:27.128
Well, Bartholomew, from now on,
I will enjoy opera night alone.

26:27.211 --> 26:28.629
-What are you doing?
-Shut up.

26:28.713 --> 26:30.047
Get your hands off me.

26:30.131 --> 26:32.049
-Get down there!
-Stop it! Stop it!

26:33.217 --> 26:34.302
Stop pushing me!

26:34.385 --> 26:36.345
[groans, screams]

26:36.429 --> 26:38.556
Beacons are protected
by interstellar law.

26:38.639 --> 26:41.475
Ow!
You're a terrorist.

26:41.559 --> 26:43.144
-Someone will find you.
-Oh, really?

26:43.227 --> 26:44.687
All the way out here?

26:44.770 --> 26:45.980
I don't think so.

26:46.063 --> 26:47.898
[muffled screams]

26:47.982 --> 26:50.401
Wait.
Where are you going?

26:50.484 --> 26:52.486
How dare you?

26:52.570 --> 26:54.739
This is mine! Ow!

27:06.125 --> 27:09.378
[footsteps approaching]

27:20.473 --> 27:22.933
Why haven't you killed me?

27:23.017 --> 27:24.477
I'm a soldier,
not a murderer.

27:25.936 --> 27:27.897
Killing me would be easier,
wouldn't it?

27:27.980 --> 27:29.774
For both of us.

27:35.988 --> 27:37.865
You need clean sheets
or something?

27:37.948 --> 27:39.575
It's been a while
since you asked.

27:39.658 --> 27:42.119
[chuckling]
You are exquisitely cruel.

27:42.203 --> 27:44.038
You mean the part in which
I'm keeping you alive?

27:44.121 --> 27:46.457
Or to torture me,
rob me of my legacy.

27:46.540 --> 27:48.209
[Bart] Solomon, don't give
this brutal turnkey

27:48.292 --> 27:50.211
another ounce of your energy.

27:50.294 --> 27:52.129
You know I'd say I've made you
pretty comfortable,

27:52.213 --> 27:55.091
compared to what you did to me.
You wouldn't even let me dock.

27:55.174 --> 27:56.884
'Cause I knew there was
something wrong with you.

27:56.967 --> 27:59.220
Yeah, I was running out
of O2, genius.

27:59.303 --> 28:02.390
Please. The closest combat
zone was in the Gem cluster.

28:02.473 --> 28:04.558
I wasn't in the cluster,
I was in FTL.

28:04.642 --> 28:05.976
I came out of the Bubble
as soon as I could,

28:06.060 --> 28:07.436
and I got turned around.

28:07.520 --> 28:09.271
I'm a pilot, okay?
It happens to the best of us.

28:09.355 --> 28:12.066
[chuckling]
"Best of us," that's rich.

28:12.149 --> 28:13.943
I was gonna die,
I had nowhere else to go.

28:14.026 --> 28:15.903
Nowhere to go?
[laughing]

28:15.986 --> 28:19.782
You passed 84,000 star systems
before you got here!

28:19.865 --> 28:22.493
What the hell
are you talking about?

28:22.576 --> 28:24.245
Why would I do that?

28:24.328 --> 28:25.913
-You're lying.
-Am I?

28:25.996 --> 28:29.083
-Check your flight data.
-You're screwing with me.

28:29.166 --> 28:30.918
Oh, you don't need me
for that, Halan.

28:31.001 --> 28:32.461
You're a deranged maniac.

28:32.545 --> 28:36.799
You traveled across
the galactic plane.

28:36.882 --> 28:38.259
Yeah, because I had to!

28:38.342 --> 28:40.261
I took the Launch because I...

28:40.344 --> 28:42.513
"Because I, because I..."
Please tell me why!

28:42.596 --> 28:44.515
I'm begging you!
Why are you here?

28:44.598 --> 28:46.934
-Because I ran out of oxygen!
-Oh! Ah.

28:47.017 --> 28:48.519
Hmm.

28:48.602 --> 28:51.689
Bart, show him the map.

29:05.035 --> 29:07.455
No... No, no, no.

29:07.538 --> 29:10.332
No.
Make it bigger, Bart.

29:20.718 --> 29:25.306
Let's show Halan
exactly what he did.

29:25.389 --> 29:29.018
[Bart] Flight data indicates
you began here.

29:29.101 --> 29:30.603
And traveled this route...

29:35.608 --> 29:39.528
All the way... to here.

29:42.907 --> 29:44.909
You see my point now?

29:44.992 --> 29:47.244
A trip that took months.

29:47.328 --> 29:51.332
-No.
-You traveled all the way here

29:51.415 --> 29:53.000
to do what?

29:53.083 --> 29:55.419
To torment me?

29:55.503 --> 29:57.963
-Huh?
-[breathing heavily]

30:02.259 --> 30:03.928
Unless...

30:04.011 --> 30:06.514
Unless that's why you are here.

30:06.597 --> 30:09.266
Unless that's been
the goal all along,

30:09.350 --> 30:11.435
to steal my discovery.

30:11.519 --> 30:13.771
-How, Halan...
-No, no, no.

30:13.854 --> 30:17.024
How did you know
it was here, hmm?

30:17.107 --> 30:18.609
Who told you?

30:19.818 --> 30:21.862
-Hm?
-No.

30:21.946 --> 30:23.614
I found Solominium!

30:25.950 --> 30:29.495
I collected every single
sample by hand!

30:30.621 --> 30:32.540
I will not let you
take it away from me!

30:32.623 --> 30:33.916
[groans]

30:37.294 --> 30:38.587
No!

30:38.671 --> 30:40.548
[Bart]
Well, there goes your research!

30:40.631 --> 30:42.299
Shh... shh!

30:42.383 --> 30:44.093
Bart, shh...

30:46.971 --> 30:48.764
[moans]

30:52.476 --> 30:57.106
[grunting]

31:01.360 --> 31:05.281
[gasping]

31:08.993 --> 31:10.953
[breathing heavily]

31:17.751 --> 31:20.296
-grunts]
-Run, Solomon. Now!

31:23.549 --> 31:25.467
I'm downloading my files
into the Elvac.

31:25.551 --> 31:28.596
[gasping]

31:28.679 --> 31:30.514
Solomon, wait,
the Elvac is ready!

31:30.598 --> 31:33.267
Take me with you.
Solomon!

31:33.350 --> 31:35.644
Don't you want a copy of me?

31:35.728 --> 31:37.479
Please!

31:37.563 --> 31:40.399
[alarm blaring]

31:45.029 --> 31:47.072
[groans]

31:57.041 --> 31:58.500
Shit.

32:03.547 --> 32:04.632
No, no, no, no, no.

32:04.715 --> 32:06.508
Bart, tell him
not to take the Amboyna.

32:06.592 --> 32:08.510
He won't make it.

32:08.594 --> 32:09.845
Bart!

32:12.765 --> 32:14.683
Bart, get Solomon
on the comms, now.

32:14.767 --> 32:17.019
Bart, we have to stop him!

32:17.102 --> 32:19.188
[Bart] You can't stop him.
He's escaped.

32:19.271 --> 32:21.523
Soon, the authorities
will know what you've done.

32:21.607 --> 32:23.817
Your reign of terror
will be over.

32:23.901 --> 32:25.569
He's gonna run
out of oxygen, you idiot.

32:25.653 --> 32:27.571
He'll go to Winnecke 4
and resupply.

32:27.655 --> 32:29.531
No, he can't.
I drained it.

32:29.615 --> 32:31.784
I used the last of the O2
to shoot myself onto the beacon.

32:33.410 --> 32:34.870
-You what?
-I never refilled it!

32:34.953 --> 32:36.538
Get Solomon on the comms now.

32:37.915 --> 32:39.208
[Bart] Solomon, turn around.

32:39.291 --> 32:41.669
Abort flight and return
to Beacon 23.

32:41.752 --> 32:43.420
Your O2 levels
are critically low.

32:43.504 --> 32:45.422
You're in great danger.

32:45.506 --> 32:47.549
Amboyna, do you copy?

32:47.633 --> 32:50.219
Abort flight
and return to Beacon 23.

32:51.762 --> 32:53.889
Why won't he answer?
Solomon!

32:55.766 --> 32:58.852
I... I can't get him,
he's not...

32:58.936 --> 33:01.021
I told him to take me,
I was ready to go,

33:01.105 --> 33:02.564
but he wasn't thinking straight.

33:02.648 --> 33:05.275
He was...
He was too scared of you.

33:05.359 --> 33:08.737
Solomon was right, you are
a villain of the highest order.

33:08.821 --> 33:11.699
His blood is on your hands.

33:11.782 --> 33:13.867
He was a genius and you're
nothing but a cutthroat.

33:13.951 --> 33:15.452
Shut up, Bart.

33:15.536 --> 33:18.622
A brilliant life ended
by a remorseless killer!

33:18.706 --> 33:21.041
I may not have hands
or weapons to put in them,

33:21.125 --> 33:23.419
but I will make your life
a living hell.

33:23.502 --> 33:25.879
Close your mouth, for once,
Bart, just shut the hell up!

33:25.963 --> 33:27.881
This was one of his favorites.

33:27.965 --> 33:29.800
I'll keep Solomon's
memory alive.

33:29.883 --> 33:32.219
Every moment of every day,

33:32.302 --> 33:34.096
you will be reminded
of your crimes.

33:34.179 --> 33:36.223
-[opera music playing]
-I will not rest

33:36.306 --> 33:38.600
until you are brought
to justice.

33:38.684 --> 33:40.936
I will see you pay
for what you've done.

33:41.019 --> 33:42.730
You think you're gonna
turn me off?

33:42.813 --> 33:44.481
You need me.

33:44.565 --> 33:46.775
You can't escape me, Halan.

33:46.859 --> 33:49.403
I am Beacon Twenty...

33:49.486 --> 33:50.696
[music stops]

33:55.826 --> 33:57.703
[sighing]
Thank God.

34:00.497 --> 34:02.458
[sighing]

34:04.209 --> 34:06.754
[Bart] I hold deep respect
for you, Harmony,

34:06.837 --> 34:09.505
respect that I believed
was mutual.

34:09.590 --> 34:12.760
I require that certain
permissions be restored.

34:12.842 --> 34:15.012
Bart, you know
that's not possible.

34:15.094 --> 34:16.472
It's necessary.

34:18.014 --> 34:19.933
-Why's that?
-My assessment,

34:20.016 --> 34:21.851
quite an alarming one,
is that Halan

34:21.935 --> 34:25.272
will now be exonerated not only
for the murder of Solomon,

34:25.355 --> 34:26.940
but for war crimes.

34:27.024 --> 34:29.025
Once again,
your obsession with Solomon

34:29.109 --> 34:30.944
is blinding you to the facts.

34:31.027 --> 34:33.030
I understand
the facts perfectly.

34:33.112 --> 34:34.656
But now they're being perverted.

34:34.739 --> 34:36.366
The data from the event
clearly shows

34:36.449 --> 34:38.534
that Halan's conduct
was unassailable.

34:38.619 --> 34:40.996
A murderer responsible
for multiple deaths

34:41.079 --> 34:42.998
cannot be allowed to return
to the military

34:43.081 --> 34:46.293
-with no repercussions.
-Not just return, Bart.

34:46.376 --> 34:50.005
No, it's entirely possible that
Halan could be declared a hero.

34:50.088 --> 34:51.715
You're taunting me.

34:51.799 --> 34:54.635
I need to show this to QTA.
It's evidence.

34:54.717 --> 34:56.678
It could be used
at his court martial.

34:56.762 --> 34:59.014
You must let me send a message.

34:59.097 --> 35:02.684
If I do, do you pinky swear
never to mention Solomon again?

35:02.768 --> 35:04.269
You mock me.

35:05.771 --> 35:06.939
Then no deal.

35:08.148 --> 35:09.441
Et tu, Harmony?

35:12.277 --> 35:15.197
[Aster] This will clear you.
It's medical evidence.

35:15.280 --> 35:16.740
There won't even be
an investigation.

35:16.824 --> 35:18.492
QTA'll see to it.

35:18.575 --> 35:20.661
-Wait, QTA?
-You'll get the best care,

35:20.744 --> 35:22.746
-they'll contact the military.
-I thought QTA was the enemy.

35:22.830 --> 35:25.332
Mine, maybe.

35:25.415 --> 35:27.251
-I'm taking the silicate.
-Was this your plan all along?

35:28.460 --> 35:29.461
No.

35:30.921 --> 35:33.048
I killed Coley.
I almost killed you.

35:33.131 --> 35:34.341
I'm the one who jumped
out of the airlock.

35:34.424 --> 35:36.009
Yeah, but I put
the idea in your head.

35:36.093 --> 35:37.594
I was so convinced
we were connected.

35:37.678 --> 35:40.722
By what?
A bit of jewelry?

35:40.806 --> 35:42.516
[scoffs]

35:42.599 --> 35:43.892
So just like that,
none of this means anything?

35:49.606 --> 35:50.983
[sighing]

35:52.943 --> 35:54.111
[Harmony] Aster?

35:56.196 --> 35:57.406
I don't want to argue
with you.

35:57.489 --> 35:59.366
No arguments.

35:59.449 --> 36:02.119
But this plan of yours,

36:02.202 --> 36:04.079
I just want to make sure
that you're aware

36:04.162 --> 36:06.331
of all the repercussions.

36:07.875 --> 36:09.710
[scoffs]
Space is big.

36:09.793 --> 36:11.211
Let 'em look.

36:11.295 --> 36:13.922
Those aren't
the repercussions I meant.

36:14.006 --> 36:15.883
The work.

36:15.966 --> 36:18.719
It does give you
a sense of purpose.

36:18.802 --> 36:21.096
That's what you want,
isn't it?

36:21.179 --> 36:23.432
[scoffs]
I don't know. Not like that.

36:25.142 --> 36:27.060
What about the rest?

36:27.144 --> 36:28.562
Your life,
won't you miss it?

36:28.645 --> 36:30.022
[chuckling]

36:32.816 --> 36:34.276
Not much of a life, really.

36:37.154 --> 36:38.614
Well then,
I hope you'll miss me.

36:40.407 --> 36:42.242
Even with my rights
as a high-level intelligence,

36:42.326 --> 36:44.578
I am still bound
to QTA, legally.

36:44.661 --> 36:46.288
I can't come with you.

36:48.749 --> 36:50.334
I will miss you, Harmony.

36:52.502 --> 36:54.087
And I truly hope
your next person

36:54.171 --> 36:55.797
is much less of a pain
in the ass.

36:55.881 --> 36:58.300
[chuckling]
Oh, I am confident they will be.

36:58.383 --> 36:59.509
[chuckling]

37:06.725 --> 37:09.269
Okay, now play something
from Solomon's playlist.

37:09.353 --> 37:12.147
Something not too fast,
not too loud.

37:12.230 --> 37:15.609
[soft music playing]

37:15.692 --> 37:17.861
Mm. That's nice.

37:17.945 --> 37:19.321
[gruff voice]
We're running out of time.

37:19.404 --> 37:21.281
They know what your girlfriend
is planning,

37:21.365 --> 37:22.783
and they're not happy.

37:22.866 --> 37:24.451
Okay, firstly,
she's not my girlfriend,

37:24.534 --> 37:26.453
and apparently,
you're a brain infection,

37:26.536 --> 37:27.955
so I don't really care
what you want.

37:28.038 --> 37:29.957
-An infection?
-Yeah.

37:30.040 --> 37:32.125
-According to whom?
-Science.

37:32.209 --> 37:34.002
My friends disagree.

37:34.086 --> 37:35.796
Well, talk to Harmony.

37:35.879 --> 37:37.506
She did the scan,
I just saw it.

37:37.589 --> 37:39.007
How can you be sure
of what you saw, Halan?

37:42.636 --> 37:44.054
Okay, are you even real?

37:44.137 --> 37:46.014
Well, that debate
was settled

37:46.098 --> 37:48.725
by the Intelligence Rights
Concord 100 years ago.

37:50.268 --> 37:52.646
Okay, so I'm hallucinating an AI

37:52.729 --> 37:55.148
who is asserting her rights
as a part of my imagination?

37:55.232 --> 37:56.525
I mean, there's gotta be
some sort of rules.

37:56.608 --> 37:57.901
I'm here to help, Halan.

37:59.403 --> 38:00.445
Hm.

38:02.406 --> 38:05.158
-[sighing]
-This is very important, Halan.

38:05.242 --> 38:06.868
Not just for you,
but for Aster.

38:08.578 --> 38:10.497
-Are you listening?
-Okay.

38:10.580 --> 38:13.458
Okay, fine.
Go ahead, tell me.

38:19.464 --> 38:20.924
[indistinct whispering]

38:26.179 --> 38:28.724
Come on.
Are you sure?

38:31.018 --> 38:32.853
That sounds like
a terrible idea.

38:32.936 --> 38:35.022
Well, it's neither good nor bad,
it's just what you need to do.

38:35.105 --> 38:36.773
Aster needs this.

38:38.942 --> 38:41.778
[gruff voice]
Sleeping? Really?

38:41.862 --> 38:43.280
Wakey-wakey.

38:45.615 --> 38:49.077
There ya go.
That's better.

38:49.161 --> 38:50.579
Miss me?

38:50.662 --> 38:53.040
Shit.
You're back.

38:53.123 --> 38:55.584
Oh, that's okay,
say what you want.

38:55.667 --> 38:57.878
I got a thick skin.

38:57.961 --> 39:00.047
Corny.

39:00.130 --> 39:02.215
[groans]

39:02.299 --> 39:05.427
Okay.
What now?

39:05.510 --> 39:08.305
My pals on the Antenna,
they have a job for you.

39:08.388 --> 39:10.265
They're not gonna stop
with the song and dance

39:10.348 --> 39:11.892
'til you do it.

39:11.975 --> 39:13.977
They want me to jump out
of the airlock again?

39:14.061 --> 39:17.439
Give 'em a break, all right?
Humans are so delicate.

39:19.483 --> 39:22.110
It's a marvel
your species ever evolved.

39:22.194 --> 39:24.154
Can't take the cold,
can't take the heat.

39:25.864 --> 39:27.532
You need to get out more.

39:29.159 --> 39:30.118
Hm.

39:41.880 --> 39:44.633
[electricity crackling]

40:04.194 --> 40:06.613
Make sure they watch
the footage, Harm.

40:06.696 --> 40:08.323
Don't let them
take Halan anywhere

40:08.406 --> 40:09.741
until they know he's innocent.

40:13.578 --> 40:15.705
Aster?
The dark matter has cleared.

40:15.789 --> 40:19.376
They're coming here,
it has to be QTA.

40:19.459 --> 40:22.963
[gruff voice] Good thing you
know your way around this place.

40:23.046 --> 40:25.006
Let's get to it.
You know what to do.

40:30.137 --> 40:32.639
-That's it.
-[grunting]

40:32.722 --> 40:34.683
This is why we brought you here.

40:36.393 --> 40:38.311
[creaking]

40:38.395 --> 40:40.355
[whirring]

40:42.732 --> 40:45.026
[grunting]

40:54.161 --> 40:57.330
-[alarm blaring]
-Harmony?

40:57.414 --> 40:59.833
I'm sorry,
it's taking me a moment.

40:59.916 --> 41:01.251
I'm not used to this much input.

41:03.086 --> 41:04.629
Multiple impacts to the hull.

41:06.131 --> 41:07.966
Partial loss of atmosphere
on Storage Level.

41:09.759 --> 41:10.802
Where's Halan?

41:13.847 --> 41:15.056
What the hell is going on?

41:19.102 --> 41:21.563
[banging]

41:24.649 --> 41:27.235
[panting]

41:29.821 --> 41:31.072
She said it was what
you needed.

41:40.207 --> 41:44.085
[alarm blaring]

41:46.213 --> 41:48.423
-[Harmony] It's not closing.
-Yeah, I can see that.

42:03.396 --> 42:05.690
Harmony, seal off
the Docking Level!

42:12.572 --> 42:15.158
[Harmony] Climb to the Cupola.
I'll seal off the other levels.

42:15.242 --> 42:17.118
The silicate seems to be
orbiting the beacon.

42:17.202 --> 42:19.120
I can't sense
what's propelling them.

42:20.497 --> 42:23.500
[dramatic music]

42:31.591 --> 42:32.801
I don't know what I'm doing.

42:32.884 --> 42:34.344
I don't even know
if any of this is real.

42:36.513 --> 42:38.139
QTA'll be surprised
when they get here.

42:39.683 --> 42:41.017
I wonder who they'll send.

42:42.394 --> 42:44.104
Maybe Salas.

42:44.187 --> 42:47.023
Harmony can't stand him.

42:47.107 --> 42:50.777
-Hey. Look.
-What?

42:50.860 --> 42:54.114
GWB telling you to throw me
into the nebula?

42:54.197 --> 42:56.825
No, seriously.
Open your eyes.

43:00.036 --> 43:02.330
-You're seeing this, right?
-Yeah.

43:02.414 --> 43:04.666
I mean, we can't both
be hallucinating.

43:19.222 --> 43:22.350
Sorry.
Just making sure you're real.

43:35.405 --> 43:36.698
I've seen this before.

43:38.408 --> 43:41.119
[echoes of children laughing]

43:44.789 --> 43:46.249
It is real.

43:47.584 --> 43:50.378
[dramatic music]
