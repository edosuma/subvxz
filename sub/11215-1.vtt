00:33.601 --> 00:35.403
(siren chirps)

00:35.436 --> 00:37.405
(people shouting)

00:43.877 --> 00:45.546
Get up!
Stand back! Stand back!

00:45.579 --> 00:46.614
Got him?
Get back!

00:49.717 --> 00:51.152
Get back!

00:51.185 --> 00:53.587
Get back! Get back!

00:53.621 --> 00:55.423
(percussive beat)

00:55.456 --> 00:57.558
MAN:
Officer Ben Sherman
is halfway through

00:57.591 --> 01:01.395
his one-year probationary
period as an LAPD officer.

01:01.429 --> 01:05.433
The job hasn't turned out to be
exactly what he'd expected.

01:17.545 --> 01:19.480
(birds chirping)

01:31.425 --> 01:35.163
(footsteps approaching)

01:36.764 --> 01:40.168
Cathleen Kerik calls me
last night here at the house.

01:40.168 --> 01:42.236
Okay? And she
tells me attendance

01:42.270 --> 01:44.772
for the press conference
is mandatory.

01:44.805 --> 01:46.707
Can you believe that?

01:46.740 --> 01:50.478
Like I'm some kid, and I'm
gonna skip school the next day.

01:50.511 --> 01:51.612
It won't be so bad.

01:51.645 --> 01:53.281
Won't be so bad?

01:53.314 --> 01:55.749
Come on, Russ. What am I--
the poster child

01:55.783 --> 01:57.551
for the entire department now?

01:57.585 --> 01:59.220
Come on. You love it.

01:59.253 --> 02:01.289
I do not, Russ.

02:01.322 --> 02:02.390
(exhales)

02:02.423 --> 02:03.824
Well, you can't blame them.

02:03.857 --> 02:05.759
I mean, you look great on TV.

02:05.793 --> 02:09.697
(scoffs)
They probably want me to pose
with the damn shotgun.

02:09.730 --> 02:12.400
What are you gonna wear?

02:12.433 --> 02:13.701
What?

02:13.734 --> 02:15.369
Uh, you know what?

02:15.403 --> 02:18.639
You should wear
that black jacket.

02:18.672 --> 02:20.741
Shut up.

02:20.774 --> 02:23.244
You're gonna be on the news.
You might as well look good.

02:23.277 --> 02:25.279
How are you doing?

02:25.313 --> 02:26.747
Great.

02:26.780 --> 02:30.751
Thinking about running
an Iron Man this weekend.

02:30.784 --> 02:32.553
Hey, I got to go.

02:32.586 --> 02:35.689
Well, hey, I'm gonna stop by
later on, all right?

02:35.723 --> 02:36.824
Okay. Sure.

02:36.857 --> 02:38.692
Take care, partner.

02:50.304 --> 02:54.242
(men chuckling)

02:55.609 --> 02:57.911
(turns video off)
Listen up.

02:57.945 --> 03:00.248
We live in the digital age.

03:00.248 --> 03:02.616
You are always being recorded.

03:02.650 --> 03:04.652
If it isn't a citizen
with a camcorder,

03:04.685 --> 03:06.454
it's a security camera
down the street

03:06.487 --> 03:07.921
or a banger with an iPhone.

03:07.955 --> 03:10.624
There's no place to hide.
You will be on TV.

03:10.658 --> 03:12.493
Spoke to Dewey
in rehab yesterday.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.362
He's at Malcolm's House
in Palm Springs

03:14.395 --> 03:15.929
if any of you want to visit.

03:15.963 --> 03:18.532
I'm passing around a card
if you want to sign.

03:18.566 --> 03:19.700
Lucky bastard.

03:19.733 --> 03:21.835
Wish I had
a drinking problem.

03:21.869 --> 03:24.672
(laughter)
We have a gang abatement
press conference today.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.974
The process does work,
so if you see dealing

03:27.007 --> 03:29.543
at any of the dope houses,
document it.

03:29.577 --> 03:31.379
D.A.'s office is
pressing hard again.

03:31.412 --> 03:32.480
Here's the stolen cars
for today.

03:34.014 --> 03:37.318
All right, Brown,
you're with Ferguson, A35.

03:37.351 --> 03:39.019
Cooper and Sherman
are working A43.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.588
Salazar and Chavez...

03:40.621 --> 03:42.623
(quietly):
He's sticking her
with the Slug.

03:42.656 --> 03:45.326
Slug?
Sherman.

03:45.359 --> 03:46.660
Captain wants
to see you

03:46.694 --> 03:47.695
end of shift.
That's it.

03:53.367 --> 03:54.602
Good luck.

04:07.681 --> 04:09.750
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait a minute.

04:09.783 --> 04:10.951
Who are you?

04:10.984 --> 04:12.953
I'm Rene Cordero,
your new partner.

04:12.986 --> 04:15.456
Stop doing that.

04:16.557 --> 04:17.758
Detective Fernandez,

04:17.791 --> 04:19.059
there's a guy out there

04:19.092 --> 04:21.429
who seems to think
he's my new partner.

04:21.462 --> 04:22.796
He is your
new partner.

04:22.830 --> 04:25.666
You said I could work alone
until Russ gets back.

04:25.699 --> 04:27.535
We're not sure
Russ is coming back.

04:27.568 --> 04:29.503
Who says?

04:29.537 --> 04:31.605
His doctor,
apparently.

04:31.639 --> 04:33.607
He's coming back.

04:33.641 --> 04:36.009
Give Cordero
a few weeks.

04:38.346 --> 04:39.913
(sighs)

04:46.754 --> 04:48.722
I'm sorry about
your partner.

04:48.756 --> 04:50.724
I know this must
be rough for you.

04:50.758 --> 04:52.493
I've got this.

04:52.526 --> 04:54.362
Excuse me.

05:00.601 --> 05:05.673
Captain wants to talk to you

05:05.706 --> 05:07.641
He'll ask you some questions;

05:07.675 --> 05:09.377
he'll look at your book;

05:09.410 --> 05:12.646
and he'll stamp your pass
to Phase Three.

05:12.680 --> 05:16.384
That means you get to ride
in the car by yourself.

05:16.417 --> 05:18.786
But just because
the department says you're ready

05:18.819 --> 05:21.021
doesn't mean I think
you're ready. Here.

05:21.054 --> 05:23.757
Phase Three,
you drive.

05:23.791 --> 05:25.526
Cool.

05:25.559 --> 05:28.762
We'll find out
if it's cool.

05:28.796 --> 05:30.831
Those suspects
who are not dead or in jail

05:30.864 --> 05:32.633
will be in custody soon.

05:32.666 --> 05:35.403
This is ground zero,
and we will not be going away.

05:35.403 --> 05:36.670
Freaking dog-and-pony show.

05:36.704 --> 05:39.072
You have the right
to be safe in your beds.

05:39.106 --> 05:41.609
You have the right
to be safe in the streets,

05:41.642 --> 05:45.713
and we're not gonna tolerate
gang violence any longer.

06:08.469 --> 06:10.704
(tires squeal, gunfire)

06:13.707 --> 06:15.776
(woman screams)

06:16.810 --> 06:17.745
(engine revs)

06:17.778 --> 06:20.914
(crowd shouting)

06:20.948 --> 06:23.717
We cut the head off
of one of the gangs today.

06:23.751 --> 06:25.619
And you all know
what it's like

06:25.653 --> 06:27.555
when a chicken gets
its head cut off?

06:27.588 --> 06:29.723
It runs around a little bit.

06:29.757 --> 06:32.059
And we're gonna chase
these headless chickens

06:32.092 --> 06:34.061
for as long as it takes.

06:34.094 --> 06:35.629
(applause)

06:35.663 --> 06:38.766
(gunfire)

06:38.799 --> 06:41.769
(horns honking)

06:41.802 --> 06:44.104
(gunfire)
POLICE CHIEF:
It's very simple.

06:44.137 --> 06:47.541
You use a gun, you go to jail.

06:47.575 --> 06:50.143
You sell drugs
from your house,

06:50.177 --> 06:52.880
we will
knock it down.
WOMAN:
Yeah!

06:52.913 --> 06:55.683
We are here to stay...

06:55.716 --> 06:58.118
for as long as it takes.

06:58.151 --> 06:59.720
WOMAN:
Yeah!
(applause)

06:59.753 --> 07:00.954
Now, knock it down!

07:07.695 --> 07:09.630
(crowd whooping)

07:11.264 --> 07:13.200
(tires screech)

07:15.803 --> 07:17.805
(gunfire)

07:23.010 --> 07:24.945
(tires squeal)

07:30.818 --> 07:32.886
Do we handle missing persons?

07:32.920 --> 07:34.855
Excuse me?

07:34.888 --> 07:38.559
This call, it's an
old missing guy, right?

07:38.592 --> 07:41.094
I thought all missing reports
went downtown.

07:41.128 --> 07:43.764
Patrol must think
there's something more to it.

07:43.797 --> 07:44.998
Oh, yeah?

07:45.032 --> 07:46.133
Like what?

07:50.771 --> 07:51.739
Are you married?

07:51.772 --> 07:53.073
No.

07:53.106 --> 07:55.743
What?! Why is a fine woman
like you not married?

07:55.776 --> 07:58.679
Ooh, you know, let's stop
with the "fine woman" talk.

07:58.712 --> 08:00.981
I really hate that.

08:01.014 --> 08:02.716
I'm just trying
to be friendly.

08:02.750 --> 08:04.552
Don't.

08:16.864 --> 08:18.566
How you doing?
Good.

08:18.599 --> 08:19.700
Detective Moretta.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.702
Somebody pissed somebody off.

08:21.735 --> 08:24.104
Who is this guy?
He only has
Mexican I.D.

08:24.137 --> 08:25.573
Looks like
a day worker.

08:25.573 --> 08:27.207
Day worker?
In a Bentley?

08:27.240 --> 08:29.743
God bless America.

08:29.777 --> 08:31.712
Who's the car registered to?

08:31.745 --> 08:33.814
Platinum
Motorsports
on La Brea.

08:33.847 --> 08:34.948
Oh, yeah?

08:34.982 --> 08:36.216
That's Trinny Day's place.

08:36.249 --> 08:38.018
SAMMY:
Oh, yeah?
Sal put him away

08:38.051 --> 08:40.654
back in the '80s--
a huge dealer, banger.

08:40.688 --> 08:42.189
Was it reported stolen?

08:42.222 --> 08:44.324
No, we checked.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.760
This is some
south-of-the-border shit.

08:46.794 --> 08:49.229
Sinaloa
shoot-out.

08:51.765 --> 08:55.135
(sighs):
Phase Two used
to be nine months.

08:55.168 --> 08:57.705
Nine. Now it's six.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.072
Pretty soon,
they'll be

08:59.106 --> 09:01.842
sending you boots straight
from Academy graduation

09:01.875 --> 09:04.978
to raiding gang houses
by yourself in Watts.

09:05.012 --> 09:08.749
So, what's the deal with
Chickie and that Ferguson guy?

09:08.782 --> 09:10.217
The Slug?

09:10.250 --> 09:12.620
They pissed at Chickie
for turning Dewey in?

09:12.620 --> 09:14.121
He was drinking
on the job.

09:14.154 --> 09:15.789
She-she shouldn't report that?

09:15.823 --> 09:18.626
You got to be able to trust
who you work with.

09:18.626 --> 09:20.628
She rode with Dewey
for years.

09:20.628 --> 09:21.862
She knew
he needed help.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.931
She waits until
he flips a car

09:23.964 --> 09:25.933
to say something?

09:25.966 --> 09:27.635
Nah. Your partner's in trouble,

09:27.668 --> 09:30.303
you find a way
to help him before

09:30.337 --> 09:31.839
it gets out of control.

09:38.812 --> 09:40.814
Hey! Yellow does
not mean stop.

09:40.848 --> 09:42.783
Okay? You almost
caused an accident.

09:42.816 --> 09:44.852
You got something
to be nervous about?

09:44.885 --> 09:46.353
No, no.
No?

09:46.386 --> 09:47.921
Yes, I mean...
Are you sure?

09:47.955 --> 09:49.256
No, I'm sorry. Yes.

09:49.289 --> 09:50.791
Get the hell
out of here.

09:50.824 --> 09:52.926
Hey! When it is green.

10:02.402 --> 10:06.807
Both hands on the wheel--
it's not your daddy's Jag.

10:08.909 --> 10:10.778
Go!

10:10.811 --> 10:13.781
(honking horn)
Go! Come on!

10:13.814 --> 10:16.383
There's no way he'd leave
his tools out here like this.

10:16.416 --> 10:17.885
And his cane?

10:17.918 --> 10:19.887
LYDIA:
Your brother
lives alone?
Yes.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.354
At 82?

10:21.388 --> 10:23.190
He's very
independent.

10:23.223 --> 10:25.759
I come by to check
on him every morning.

10:25.793 --> 10:27.761
That was the last time
you saw him?

10:27.795 --> 10:29.763
Yes. I-I help him
to monitor his sugar,

10:29.797 --> 10:31.799
and I give him his shot;
he's a diabetic.

10:31.832 --> 10:33.734
Has he ever
wandered off before?

10:33.767 --> 10:35.068
He hasn't
wandered off!

10:35.102 --> 10:37.070
Something's
happened to him!

10:37.104 --> 10:39.439
Does he have any history
of Alzheimer's,

10:39.472 --> 10:41.675
dementia, never
disappeared overnight

10:41.709 --> 10:43.911
or for a couple of hours?
No! Never.

10:43.944 --> 10:45.112
Okay. Anything missing

10:45.145 --> 10:46.747
from inside?
Nope.

10:46.780 --> 10:48.048
Just his car.

10:48.081 --> 10:49.382
His car?

10:50.483 --> 10:52.452
(scoffs)
He drives?

10:52.485 --> 10:54.688
Can somebody tell me
when he's on the road,

10:54.722 --> 10:56.323
so I can be at home
watching TV?

10:56.356 --> 10:57.691
Canvass the neighborhood.

10:57.725 --> 10:59.292
Find out
if anybody saw him leave.

10:59.326 --> 11:00.961
Here you go.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.395
You know, we should
call this in.

11:02.429 --> 11:03.964
Let Missing Persons
handle it.

11:03.997 --> 11:06.900
You got someplace else
you need to be, then go.

11:06.934 --> 11:08.769
I'm sure Fernandez
will find somebody else

11:08.802 --> 11:10.137
for you to work with.

11:12.405 --> 11:14.407
(indistinct radio transmission)

11:14.441 --> 11:15.743
Turn right.

11:15.776 --> 11:16.844
Turn right! Turn right!

11:16.877 --> 11:18.946
What'd you see?

11:20.180 --> 11:22.249
Okay.

11:23.917 --> 11:24.918
Okay.

11:25.919 --> 11:27.187
Hold that.

11:44.938 --> 11:48.108
(sighs)

11:48.141 --> 11:49.276
Go.

11:53.013 --> 11:54.481
I can't believe this guy.

11:54.514 --> 11:57.050
I'm telling you, Russ,
you would die.

11:57.084 --> 11:59.953
He's got a little hanky
in his jacket pocket.

11:59.987 --> 12:03.356
He was interrogating
this poor woman

12:03.390 --> 12:05.092
like he was Sherlock Holmes

12:05.125 --> 12:08.962
with these penetrating
questions.

12:08.996 --> 12:13.133
Well, he is a detective, Lydia.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.836
I know, but I'm telling you
you would hate him.

12:15.869 --> 12:18.238
He just wants
to hang out downtown

12:18.271 --> 12:19.807
and wait for something sexy

12:19.807 --> 12:23.043
or like a double homicide
or a beheading.

12:23.076 --> 12:25.312
Hey, uh, I gotta go.

12:25.345 --> 12:28.415
Well, you want me to bring you
something by later?

12:28.448 --> 12:29.883
Uh, no. You know what?

12:29.917 --> 12:31.184
Dina's coming by
in a little bit.

12:31.218 --> 12:34.855
You know I have your back,
partner, right?

12:34.888 --> 12:35.856
Yeah.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.229
Detective!

12:45.598 --> 12:48.235
You're driving too fast.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.837
Slow down.

12:49.837 --> 12:51.839
(sighs)

12:51.872 --> 12:54.842
You pass Driver Training
at the Academy?

12:54.842 --> 12:57.244
Yeah, I did,
with flying colors.

12:59.346 --> 13:01.381
How's your back?

13:01.414 --> 13:02.415
What?

13:02.449 --> 13:03.483
Your back--
how is it?

13:05.618 --> 13:07.454
Look at this.

13:13.894 --> 13:15.528
Hey, dummy!

13:15.562 --> 13:17.597
Look like a public urinal
to you?

13:17.630 --> 13:20.901
Stop now.

13:22.535 --> 13:23.871
What's your name?

13:23.904 --> 13:28.308
Alan Gaylord.

13:28.341 --> 13:29.376
What's in the bag?

13:29.409 --> 13:32.212
Beer.

13:35.582 --> 13:36.984
Cite him.

13:37.017 --> 13:38.986
What for?

13:39.019 --> 13:42.022
25.620A: Open container.

13:42.055 --> 13:44.291
May I see
your I.D., sir?

13:44.324 --> 13:48.161
Your I.D. Hands.

13:51.431 --> 13:53.166
I'm on parole.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.302
This gonna violate me?

13:55.335 --> 13:57.204
Turn around
and face the fence.

13:57.237 --> 13:59.572
Hands behind your head.

14:00.974 --> 14:02.542
I don't know, Alan.

14:02.575 --> 14:05.578
If I search your pockets,
am I gonna find anything?

14:05.612 --> 14:07.047
No.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.248
How about when

14:08.281 --> 14:10.417
I put your name
in my computer?

14:10.450 --> 14:12.419
We gonna come back
with any warrants?

14:12.452 --> 14:13.486
No, sir.

14:13.520 --> 14:14.521
All right.

14:14.554 --> 14:15.488
You know what, Alan?

14:15.522 --> 14:17.257
It's your lucky day.

14:17.290 --> 14:21.594
You're just gonna get a ticket
and be on your way.

14:23.330 --> 14:24.932
Why don't you
have a seat.

14:28.936 --> 14:31.939
The old guy was out front
when I was leaving for work.

14:31.972 --> 14:34.241
He's always out there
working in his garden.

14:34.274 --> 14:36.143
Guy's a (bleep) fossil.

14:36.176 --> 14:37.444
He's, like,
a hundred or something.

14:37.477 --> 14:39.112
Gets pissed when
you park on the street

14:39.146 --> 14:40.180
in front of his house.

14:40.213 --> 14:41.348
Starts yelling
and shit.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.583
Just tell the detective
what you saw.

14:43.616 --> 14:46.419
As I'm walking to my car,

14:46.453 --> 14:48.655
there's a guy in the yard
talking to him.

14:48.688 --> 14:50.423
And that was unusual?

14:50.457 --> 14:51.524
This guy, yeah.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.060
He was sketchy,
you know?

14:53.093 --> 14:54.494
Standing over
the old man.

14:54.527 --> 14:55.628
Sketchy how?

14:55.662 --> 14:57.998
Big, shaved head.

14:58.031 --> 14:59.299
Caucasian, Hispanic?

14:59.332 --> 15:00.700
Black.

15:00.733 --> 15:03.270
And I was thinking
if the old man was yelling

15:03.303 --> 15:05.405
at this guy for parking
in front of his house,

15:05.438 --> 15:07.374
he was gonna get
his ass kicked.

15:07.407 --> 15:11.011
But then they just got
in the old man's car
and drove off.

15:11.044 --> 15:13.713
Did Mr. Noyes go willingly?

15:13.746 --> 15:16.616
Big guy sort of helped him up.
Had him by the arm.

15:16.649 --> 15:18.218
Did he see something?
Did you see my brother?

15:18.251 --> 15:20.720
What did he do?

15:20.753 --> 15:22.489
Did he seem like
he was scared,

15:22.522 --> 15:23.656
intimidated in any way?

15:23.690 --> 15:25.458
I don't know.

15:25.492 --> 15:27.627
It was kind of weird is
that they left, though.

15:27.660 --> 15:29.329
The big guy was driving.

15:29.362 --> 15:31.698
I could see the old man
in the seat next to him.

15:31.731 --> 15:33.466
I thought maybe he was crying.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.635
Oh, God.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.010
You want me to start
the paperwork

15:43.010 --> 15:44.077
to get his bank records?

15:44.111 --> 15:45.178
I already
started it.

15:45.212 --> 15:49.449
Should we call
a press conference?

15:49.482 --> 15:50.717
Press conference?

15:50.750 --> 15:52.052
You know, alert the media.

15:52.085 --> 15:53.486
Let the public help us find him.

15:53.520 --> 15:56.356
4,000 people go missing
a year in L.A.

15:56.389 --> 15:59.326
We can't run to the media
ten, 12 times a day.

15:59.359 --> 16:00.760
82-year-old man, diabetic,

16:00.793 --> 16:03.030
abducted from in front
of his nice little house

16:03.063 --> 16:04.297
in broad daylight.

16:04.331 --> 16:06.633
We don't know that
he was abducted.

16:06.666 --> 16:08.135
Hello.

16:08.168 --> 16:11.671
Yes. All right, thanks.

16:11.704 --> 16:13.640
The coroner
doesn't have him.

16:13.673 --> 16:16.676
Makes for a nice story
on Channel 5.

16:16.709 --> 16:19.512
You want the media,
call the sister.

16:19.546 --> 16:22.215
A distraught family member
always works best.

16:22.249 --> 16:25.318
You just want your
damn face on TV.

16:25.352 --> 16:27.054
It's a nice face, though.

16:29.089 --> 16:33.526
DISPATCH:
843, handle a code 30
at 1601 North Santa Fe Street.

16:33.560 --> 16:35.728
843 en route.

16:35.762 --> 16:38.065
Meet the owner
in front of the building.

16:38.098 --> 16:41.334
I guess somebody
studied their map book.

16:41.368 --> 16:43.403
I did, actually.

16:53.580 --> 16:54.781
Nobody broke in
the front door,

16:54.814 --> 16:57.550
but the alarm went off
hours ago.

16:57.584 --> 16:59.619
I've been calling and
calling and calling.

16:59.652 --> 17:00.687
Sorry to make
you wait, sir.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.255
We've been out

17:02.289 --> 17:03.756
doing actual
police work.

17:07.594 --> 17:11.731
Good morning, sir!

17:11.764 --> 17:13.600
(chuckles)
How are you today?

17:13.633 --> 17:15.435
Could you just get me down?

17:16.803 --> 17:19.706
You know, I can't
figure you guys out.

17:19.739 --> 17:21.274
You plan a burglary,

17:21.308 --> 17:23.743
I mean, you must have
had drivers waiting

17:23.776 --> 17:25.245
to come in the
front door, right?

17:25.278 --> 17:27.114
You go through
all that trouble,

17:27.114 --> 17:30.383
and you can't bring a rope
that's long enough.

17:30.417 --> 17:32.252
You know how many
of these dumbasses

17:32.285 --> 17:33.453
I've had to cut down?

17:33.486 --> 17:35.822
Look, man, my shoulders
are killing me.

17:35.855 --> 17:37.224
Can you just hurry it up?

17:37.257 --> 17:38.558
Where are the other guys?

17:38.591 --> 17:39.792
Read me my rights

17:39.826 --> 17:41.361
and get me
the (bleep) down!

17:41.394 --> 17:42.829
Actually, I don't have
to read them.

17:42.862 --> 17:44.164
See, I have them memorized.

17:44.197 --> 17:46.166
Did you pee your pants?

17:46.199 --> 17:47.434
Come on, man.

17:51.438 --> 17:54.441
You come to me, you legitimately
want to turn your life around,

17:54.474 --> 17:56.143
you got a job here.

17:56.143 --> 17:57.644
Louis was like that.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.779
He was one of my best workers.

17:59.812 --> 18:02.382
He was executed in one
of your Bentleys

18:02.415 --> 18:03.383
with coke on him.

18:03.416 --> 18:04.884
Guys slip.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.154
They get back into the life.

18:07.154 --> 18:08.888
They can't cut the ties.

18:08.921 --> 18:11.224
Louis was former law enforcement
in Mexico.

18:11.258 --> 18:12.859
When I met him
and gave him the job,

18:12.892 --> 18:15.728
he was on the side of the road
selling oranges.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.730
That's a very
moving story,

18:17.764 --> 18:19.332
but I still
want to know

18:19.366 --> 18:20.833
why this poor worker

18:20.867 --> 18:22.235
was driving a
hundred-thousand-
dollar car

18:22.269 --> 18:23.570
with narcotics in it.

18:23.603 --> 18:26.873
Did he take the car
without your knowledge?

18:26.906 --> 18:28.475
That's what I'm saying.

18:28.508 --> 18:29.709
I think I'm saying that.

18:29.742 --> 18:30.777
But if your man here
was listening,

18:30.810 --> 18:32.445
you know what I'm saying...

18:32.479 --> 18:34.181
You're back in the game,
aren't you, Trinny?

18:34.181 --> 18:37.384
Is this whole thing
just a front?

18:37.417 --> 18:38.651
Got your brothers

18:38.685 --> 18:41.221
and others dealing
for you again?

18:41.254 --> 18:42.922
You got
your hustle going?

18:42.955 --> 18:44.724
Nah, listen, man.

18:44.757 --> 18:49.662
The only hustle that I have
going on is between me and God.

18:49.696 --> 18:51.898
And he's so good to me,

18:51.931 --> 18:54.567
I got all the ballers,
I got all the rappers,

18:54.601 --> 18:56.469
everybody want to come
over here and get

18:56.503 --> 18:58.771
their Trinny on, you know what
I'm saying? Money be green.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.240
You know
what I'm saying?

19:00.273 --> 19:02.642
All I got to do
is to stop

19:02.675 --> 19:04.911
the violence, increase
the peace on the streets,

19:04.944 --> 19:07.380
help out my fellow suffering

19:07.414 --> 19:08.948
gang members...

19:08.981 --> 19:10.950
Don't you mean former
gang members?

19:10.983 --> 19:13.753
(chuckles)

19:13.786 --> 19:15.722
Y'all got a lot
of learning to do.

19:15.755 --> 19:17.757
Y'all should just go talk
to y'all boss, man.

19:17.790 --> 19:18.925
I got a lot of respect

19:18.958 --> 19:21.261
for Detective Salinger.
You know why?

19:21.294 --> 19:23.263
You're gonna tell us, right?

19:23.296 --> 19:25.298
When I was clean,
he let me go.

19:25.332 --> 19:29.602
When I was dirty,
I did the time.

19:29.636 --> 19:32.805
Not like some others. Respect!

19:32.839 --> 19:34.874
That's what we got
going on.

19:34.907 --> 19:38.345
That's what me and him
got going on.

19:38.378 --> 19:40.680
Mr. Noyes withdrew $400
from his ATM account

19:40.713 --> 19:42.282
last night at 7:54.

19:42.315 --> 19:44.351
He attempted to withdraw
another $400

19:44.384 --> 19:46.953
from our branch
on North Hill at 8:26,

19:46.986 --> 19:48.621
but was denied.

19:48.655 --> 19:50.857
Would you like me
to cue it up

19:50.890 --> 19:51.791
to last night's
transactions?

19:51.824 --> 19:53.826
Yes, please.

19:56.496 --> 19:58.865
(typing)

20:01.934 --> 20:03.303
Yeah, that's Noyes,

20:03.336 --> 20:05.638
but I can't see
the guy next to him.

20:05.672 --> 20:07.907
Were there any other attempts
made to withdraw money

20:07.940 --> 20:09.709
last night or this morning?

20:09.742 --> 20:10.943
No.

20:10.977 --> 20:12.612
Is that
the only angle?

20:12.645 --> 20:14.013
Yes.
Well, there are people

20:14.046 --> 20:15.415
waiting in line
behind them.

20:15.448 --> 20:16.716
Maybe they had
to wait, too.

20:16.749 --> 20:18.951
Can you pull up
the transaction before?

20:18.985 --> 20:20.653
Sure.

20:22.522 --> 20:23.856
CORDERO:
Damn, he's big.

20:23.890 --> 20:27.660
(phone rings)

20:27.694 --> 20:29.396
Adams.

20:29.429 --> 20:32.299
Thanks. Patrol found his car.

20:32.332 --> 20:35.468
Droopy, why'd you go and kill
that nice girl for, huh?

20:35.502 --> 20:36.869
I swear it wasn't me, dawg.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.805
It was someone
that looked like me.

20:38.838 --> 20:40.407
I hate when
that happens.

20:40.440 --> 20:41.508
Seriously, fool, it wasn't me.

20:41.541 --> 20:42.475
I wasn't anywhere near there.

20:42.509 --> 20:44.977
Well, there was,

20:45.011 --> 20:46.413
on the Fourth Street bridge.

20:46.446 --> 20:47.514
You hear anything
about that?

20:47.547 --> 20:48.881
(chuckles)

20:48.915 --> 20:51.918
That's some wild, wild West
shit right there.

20:51.951 --> 20:54.887
The car was registered
to your old boss Trinard Day.

20:54.921 --> 20:57.657
Trinny Day, ese.

20:57.690 --> 20:58.925
(sighs)

20:58.958 --> 21:01.861
Feel so bad for being
a banger, eh?

21:01.894 --> 21:03.963
Gonna make some amends.

21:03.996 --> 21:07.967
(chuckles)
Sabes que, that fool's
still dealing drugs.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.036
Still selling weapons,

21:10.069 --> 21:13.873
only now he calls himself
a-a "interventionist."

21:13.906 --> 21:16.075
He's getting funded
by the government.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.711
Find out what happened
this morning.

21:18.745 --> 21:20.813
Then we'll see
what we can do

21:20.847 --> 21:22.349
for you from our end.

21:24.817 --> 21:26.953
All right, I'll keep my ear
to the ground.

21:26.986 --> 21:28.788
Hey, check it out, dawg.

21:28.821 --> 21:29.922
I got a new tattoo.

21:29.956 --> 21:32.024
Oh, wow,
look at that.

21:32.058 --> 21:33.593
You always liked
this shit.

21:33.626 --> 21:34.594
That's good.

21:34.627 --> 21:36.863
"Mama Tried."

21:36.896 --> 21:37.930
You know the song?

21:37.964 --> 21:38.965
What song?

21:38.998 --> 21:40.667
Como que, what song?

21:40.700 --> 21:42.535
Merle Haggard, vato.

21:42.569 --> 21:43.903
Merle who?

21:43.936 --> 21:46.806
"Mama Tried."

21:46.839 --> 21:47.674
Can you sing it?

21:47.707 --> 21:48.808
(chuckles)

21:48.841 --> 21:50.109
Can he sing it?
Check this out.

21:50.142 --> 21:52.779
* I turned 21 in prison

21:52.812 --> 21:54.714
* Doing life without parole

21:54.747 --> 21:57.550
* No one could steer me right,
but Mama tried *

21:57.584 --> 21:59.919
* Mama tried, Mama tried.

21:59.952 --> 22:01.421
(both laughing)

22:01.454 --> 22:03.089
Hey, this boy always
cracks me up, dawg.

22:03.122 --> 22:04.757
It's good.
I like it. I like it.

22:04.791 --> 22:06.826
Keep digging, Droopy.

22:06.859 --> 22:07.994
I will.

22:08.027 --> 22:09.429
Don't worry about that.

22:09.462 --> 22:10.897
(toilet flushes)

22:10.930 --> 22:13.966
Hey. But then you got to get me
out of here, all right?

22:14.000 --> 22:14.967
We'll do our best, bro.

22:16.503 --> 22:18.705
So the security guard
found it parked here.

22:18.738 --> 22:21.908
He was gonna call to have it
towed until he looked inside.

22:21.941 --> 22:23.776
Anything in the trunk?
No.

22:23.810 --> 22:24.977
Perimeter, Dumpsters?

22:25.011 --> 22:26.579
Everything
on this block.

22:26.613 --> 22:27.947
You want us to
widen the search?

22:27.980 --> 22:29.482
(helicopter passing overhead)

22:29.516 --> 22:31.718
(train whistle blowing
in distance)

22:31.751 --> 22:33.786
I'll call,
get a K-9 unit down here.

22:44.564 --> 22:45.598
in the middle
of Silver Lake.

22:45.632 --> 22:46.699
This is freakin'
major, guys.

22:46.733 --> 22:48.000
The Bentley
comes back to Trinny?

22:48.034 --> 22:48.968
Yeah.

22:49.001 --> 22:50.503
The victim worked at Platinum.

22:50.537 --> 22:52.038
GIL:
You have any idea
how close you all came

22:52.071 --> 22:53.105
to (bleep) up a six-month
surveillance today?

22:53.139 --> 22:54.807
Yo, Gil,
what's up, bro?

22:54.841 --> 22:56.443
What's up? What's up
is that we've been

22:56.476 --> 22:58.645
on this guy for months and
you guys almost blew it.

22:58.678 --> 22:59.812
Who the hell are you?

22:59.846 --> 23:01.013
Who am I? I'll
tell you...

23:01.047 --> 23:02.482
This is Gil Puente;
he's one of us.

23:02.515 --> 23:03.450
Narcotics.

23:03.483 --> 23:04.451
What are we talking about?

23:04.451 --> 23:05.918
Trinny Day.
I see you guys

23:05.952 --> 23:07.820
march in, it's like
a freakin' nightmare.

23:07.854 --> 23:09.722
I'm like... (scoffs)
Almost pissed my pants.

23:09.756 --> 23:12.158
You guys are set up over
at Platinum Motor Sports?

23:12.191 --> 23:13.660
Yes, we are,
for the last six weeks.

23:13.693 --> 23:14.761
Yeah, well, how were
we supposed to know that?

23:14.794 --> 23:15.962
We're working a homicide.

23:15.995 --> 23:17.464
Yo, man, that's
number two.

23:17.497 --> 23:19.466
Gil, Gil, we didn't know,
dude, all right?

23:19.466 --> 23:21.200
We'd never step on your toes
like that. Come on.

23:21.233 --> 23:22.469
Yo, who is
this guy, man?

23:22.469 --> 23:24.537
This is my partner, all right?

23:24.571 --> 23:25.638
Sammy Bryant,
Gil Puente.

23:25.672 --> 23:26.839
We used to work
narcotics together

23:26.873 --> 23:28.107
back in the day.

23:28.140 --> 23:30.042
Delighted. Anyway,
man, how are you?

23:30.076 --> 23:31.478
I'm-I'm, I'm pretty good, man.

23:31.478 --> 23:32.479
We just had another baby.

23:32.479 --> 23:33.513
What?!
Yeah.

23:33.546 --> 23:34.747
Yo, come here, man!

23:34.781 --> 23:35.782
Yo, that's beautiful, bro!

23:35.815 --> 23:36.783
Yo, congrats!
Thank you.

23:36.816 --> 23:38.084
GIL:
You got a factory, huh?!

23:38.117 --> 23:39.151
How about you, man?
You got any kids?

23:39.185 --> 23:40.219
We're trying.

23:40.252 --> 23:41.554
Yeah? Well, try
harder, man.

23:41.588 --> 23:42.955
(laughs)
Anyway, man,
the shootout

23:42.989 --> 23:44.624
with the Bentley, the
driver was my snitch.

23:44.657 --> 23:45.758
What's Trinny up to?

23:45.792 --> 23:46.593
He's running coke
out of Mexico.

23:46.626 --> 23:47.927
Laundering the money,

23:47.960 --> 23:49.629
bringing it back in.
Hey, man, why don't

23:49.662 --> 23:50.963
you guys come hang
out with us, man?

23:50.997 --> 23:52.499
We got ATF,
FBI, DEA on it.

23:52.532 --> 23:53.833
We could fold in
your homicide.

23:53.866 --> 23:55.602
Hell, yeah, man.
Yeah?

23:55.635 --> 23:57.003
Yeah.
I mean, you know,
that's of course,

23:57.036 --> 23:58.771
you know, Big Papa
over here says it's okay

23:58.805 --> 24:00.873
to come run
with the big dogs.

24:00.907 --> 24:02.509
Huh?

24:02.509 --> 24:04.977
Henry Noyce is 82
and was last seen

24:05.011 --> 24:06.613
accompanied by this man.

24:06.646 --> 24:09.516
If you have any information
about either man,

24:09.516 --> 24:11.918
you're asked to contact
the Los Angeles Police.

24:11.951 --> 24:13.019
WOMAN:
He's diabetic.

24:13.052 --> 24:15.922
He doesn't hear very well, so...

24:15.955 --> 24:17.924
If you've seen him,
please, please help us.

24:17.957 --> 24:20.560
Not a dry eye in the house.

24:20.593 --> 24:23.195
We missed out getting some nice
face time on that one though.

24:23.229 --> 24:25.665
All right, thanks.

24:25.698 --> 24:28.635
K-9 unit didn't find anything.

24:31.037 --> 24:32.138
How'd you know?

24:32.171 --> 24:33.172
What?

24:33.205 --> 24:35.174
The call from patrol.

24:35.207 --> 24:38.010
Why didn't you just hand it off
to Missing Persons downtown?

24:39.779 --> 24:41.080
Instinct?

24:41.113 --> 24:42.849
CoГ±o, that's why
I picked you.

24:42.882 --> 24:44.651
I mean, I knew
you were a star.

24:44.684 --> 24:46.553
I just didn't have
any idea what level.

24:46.586 --> 24:47.153
You picked me?

24:47.186 --> 24:48.655
Yeah, girl.

24:48.688 --> 24:49.656
I called in some favors,
got some hook-ins,

24:49.689 --> 24:50.957
people looking out for me.

24:50.990 --> 24:52.725
And you got to do
the same thing.

24:52.759 --> 24:55.261
You got to start using
that star quality you got.

24:55.294 --> 24:57.964
There's no telling
where we could go.

24:57.997 --> 25:00.733
You know?

25:00.767 --> 25:02.168
Excuse me.

25:02.201 --> 25:03.169
Mm-hmm.

25:03.202 --> 25:05.304
(typing)

25:05.337 --> 25:07.273
(phone ringing)

25:13.646 --> 25:15.247
Adams.

25:15.281 --> 25:18.184
CHICKIE:
That looks like one of
the stolen cars from roll call.

25:18.217 --> 25:19.318
Run the plate.

25:19.351 --> 25:22.989
I don't like
using the computer.

25:23.022 --> 25:25.592
Call it in then.

25:25.625 --> 25:28.227
What unit are we?

25:28.260 --> 25:29.896
A-35.

25:29.929 --> 25:32.198
A-35. Need wants
and warrants on

25:32.231 --> 25:35.935
2-Paul-Charles-
Edward-0-9-6.

25:43.075 --> 25:44.043
What?

25:44.076 --> 25:45.612
We got a hit off the picture.

25:48.347 --> 25:50.883
Alan Gaylord.

25:50.917 --> 25:52.619
Can't be sure it's him.

25:52.652 --> 25:54.621
The picture is
kind of grainy.

25:54.654 --> 25:55.788
He one of your guys?

25:55.822 --> 25:57.156
Yeah, paroled
two weeks ago.

25:57.189 --> 25:59.091
I only seen him
a couple of times.

25:59.125 --> 26:00.627
You know where he is now?

26:00.660 --> 26:01.961
You mean where he's
supposed to be.

26:01.994 --> 26:04.263
He was paroled
into a residential

26:04.296 --> 26:06.633
drug treatment facility.

26:06.633 --> 26:08.100
I called.

26:08.134 --> 26:10.637
He walked out yesterday,
hasn't come back.

26:10.637 --> 26:12.004
Can he just
walk out?

26:12.038 --> 26:14.641
They gave him a day pass
to go to the DMV.

26:14.641 --> 26:16.876
Supposed to call me first
to get permission.

26:16.909 --> 26:17.910
And did they?

26:17.944 --> 26:19.679
No.

26:19.712 --> 26:21.180
We're under a federal
court order to release

26:21.213 --> 26:24.684
40,000 inmates this year
to relieve overcrowding.

26:24.717 --> 26:27.820

27:33.720 --> 27:34.854
Don't move!

27:34.887 --> 27:35.822
Ferguson!

27:37.289 --> 27:38.424
(screaming, clamoring)

27:38.457 --> 27:39.992
He shot him!

27:40.026 --> 27:41.728
He shot Kadeen!

27:41.728 --> 27:43.329
He shot him!

27:43.362 --> 27:45.197
Calm down!
You better back off!

30:32.131 --> 30:34.233
What the hell
happened out there?

30:34.266 --> 30:35.868
I don't want
to talk about it.

30:35.902 --> 30:36.903
Ferguson fired
his weapon?

30:36.936 --> 30:38.170
I've got
to get him inside

30:38.204 --> 30:39.505
and notify
Force Investigation.

30:40.940 --> 30:42.441
Let's go!

30:47.079 --> 30:48.881
I'm driving.

30:52.384 --> 30:53.986
(engine starting)

30:54.020 --> 30:55.888
MAN (over radio):
All units be on the lookout

30:55.922 --> 30:58.024
for a male black, Alan Gaylord.

30:58.057 --> 30:58.991
Six-two, 200 pounds, bald.

30:59.025 --> 31:00.392
Last seen in the 800 block

31:00.426 --> 31:03.295
of South Kenmore
yesterday evening

31:03.329 --> 31:05.331
wearing jeans
and a dark blue windbreaker

31:05.364 --> 31:06.465
with yellow stripes
on the sleeves.

31:06.498 --> 31:08.067
Wanted in connection

31:08.100 --> 31:11.037
with a possible kidnapping
and vehicle theft.

31:11.070 --> 31:12.471
A-43.
We had contact

31:12.504 --> 31:14.040
with an Alan Gaylord
earlier today.

31:14.073 --> 31:16.075
Who's handling?

31:16.108 --> 31:17.944
We cited him on Garvey,
north of Third,

31:17.977 --> 31:19.045
at about 10:00
this morning.

31:19.078 --> 31:20.246
He give you
an address?

31:20.279 --> 31:21.948
Yeah, his I.D.
said Bakersfield,

31:21.948 --> 31:23.649
but he was staying
at a drug rehab house

31:23.682 --> 31:25.117
in Koreatown;
I've got the address.

31:25.151 --> 31:26.953
No, we've been,
and he's not there.

31:26.953 --> 31:28.020
You search him?
Yeah.

31:28.054 --> 31:29.188
No drugs,
no weapons.

31:29.221 --> 31:31.057
Had a couple hundred
in 20s on him.

31:31.090 --> 31:32.224
Said he got it
from a relative.

31:32.258 --> 31:33.492
Well, he's an addict.

31:33.525 --> 31:35.427
If he got high last night
and this morning,

31:35.461 --> 31:37.063
he's probably looking
to cop by now.

31:37.096 --> 31:39.966
Maybe we'll find him
in a box.

31:47.039 --> 31:49.608
Where'd you learn
to drive like that?

31:51.210 --> 31:53.679
BMW School when your daddy

31:53.712 --> 31:55.647
bought you
your new car?

31:57.183 --> 32:00.019
Tonight with the captain.

32:00.052 --> 32:02.321
Be all right.

32:02.354 --> 32:04.390
Just answer his questions.

32:05.724 --> 32:08.995
At least I won't have
to do paper on you

32:09.028 --> 32:10.662
every night anymore.

32:14.533 --> 32:17.103
Why don't we
leave this to patrol?

32:17.136 --> 32:19.471
He's got cash burning
a hole in his pocket.

32:19.505 --> 32:21.140
He's going to keep
coming out to score

32:21.173 --> 32:22.441
until he runs
out of money.

32:22.474 --> 32:24.076
Or he bought everything
he needed last night

32:24.110 --> 32:26.612
and he's somewhere
holed up getting his high.

32:26.645 --> 32:28.014
Do me a favor.

32:28.047 --> 32:30.016
Let's just not talk.

32:33.252 --> 32:35.621
BEN:
Think there's any chance
the old man is still alive?

32:35.654 --> 32:38.257
Department's got an awful lot
of units out there.

32:38.290 --> 32:39.691
Stop talking.

32:43.162 --> 32:45.031
A-43. We have suspect,

32:45.031 --> 32:46.532
Alan Gaylord,
in sight.

32:46.565 --> 32:48.667
237 wall north side.

32:49.735 --> 32:52.038
I got him.
I got him.

32:55.407 --> 32:57.709
(tires screeching)

32:57.743 --> 32:58.744
(siren wailing)

32:58.777 --> 33:00.479
A-43. Suspect fleeing on foot.

33:06.118 --> 33:08.054
(siren wailing in distance)

33:10.056 --> 33:12.191
WOMAN (over radio):
All units, A-43
is in foot pursuit

33:12.224 --> 33:14.060
of a kidnapping suspect
eastbound

33:14.093 --> 33:16.062
on First Street and Main.

33:16.062 --> 33:17.329
K-54, show us
responding

33:17.363 --> 33:19.065
to A-43's location,
code two.

33:31.110 --> 33:32.678
(tires screeching)

33:35.281 --> 33:37.216
(siren wailing)

33:40.619 --> 33:42.554
(panting)

33:46.125 --> 33:47.759
(train whistle blowing)

34:03.309 --> 34:05.677
(metallic thud, groaning)

34:07.179 --> 34:08.680
(grunting and groaning)

34:16.122 --> 34:17.789
(siren wailing)

34:19.291 --> 34:21.227
(handcuffs latching,
man groaning)

34:25.831 --> 34:27.699
Where is he?

34:27.733 --> 34:29.335
Where is he?!

34:29.368 --> 34:31.437
Can't breathe.

34:34.440 --> 34:36.775
Hey, you
all right?

34:36.808 --> 34:37.776
(groaning)

34:37.809 --> 34:40.546
Where is he?

34:40.579 --> 34:42.181
(helicopter whirring overhead)

34:42.214 --> 34:43.815
(garbled radio transmission)

34:43.849 --> 34:45.817
(siren wailing)

35:14.780 --> 35:16.482
Got him.

35:24.190 --> 35:27.193
(traffic passing by in distance)

35:42.274 --> 35:45.211
Did you carry him
down here by yourself?

35:45.211 --> 35:47.613
MAN:
Detective?

35:47.646 --> 35:49.448
We may have a pulse here.

35:49.481 --> 35:53.419
(siren wailing in distance,
helicopter whirring overhead)

36:04.663 --> 36:07.899
(stabbing, yelling)

36:07.933 --> 36:10.702
Trinny Day says hello,
you little snitch!

36:10.736 --> 36:13.339
(Miguel crying, grunting)

36:16.608 --> 36:17.909
Shit!

36:17.943 --> 36:19.845
(gasping):
Shit... shit...

36:29.388 --> 36:30.489
Hey.

36:30.522 --> 36:32.491
You wait for me?

36:32.524 --> 36:33.959
Yeah.

36:33.992 --> 36:35.561
You all right?

36:35.594 --> 36:37.429
Couple of cracked ribs.

36:37.463 --> 36:39.831
It's gonna put a crimp
on my handball game.

36:39.865 --> 36:42.334
How's our old guy?

36:42.368 --> 36:44.536
Mm, we won't know
for a couple of days.

36:44.570 --> 36:45.937
He lost a lot

36:45.971 --> 36:48.006
of blood.

36:48.039 --> 36:50.276
You're pretty fast.

36:50.309 --> 36:51.677
I'm impressed.

36:51.710 --> 36:52.944
What?

36:52.978 --> 36:54.980
Chasing Gaylord--
you must have ran

36:55.013 --> 36:58.450
that last 40 in
what, five flat?

36:58.484 --> 37:00.586
I ran track in college.

37:00.619 --> 37:02.288
So did I.

37:02.288 --> 37:03.755
Distance, mostly.

37:03.789 --> 37:04.690
Sprinter.

37:12.698 --> 37:14.366
So...

37:14.400 --> 37:16.702
want to buy an injured
colleague a drink?

37:16.735 --> 37:17.703
Maybe two?

37:17.736 --> 37:19.638
No, I have someplace to be.

37:19.671 --> 37:21.440
Hot date, huh?

37:21.473 --> 37:24.343
No, nothing like that.

37:24.376 --> 37:27.346
Right.

37:27.379 --> 37:29.348
Hope you get lucky.

37:30.449 --> 37:33.419
(quietly):
Oh, wow.

37:33.452 --> 37:35.020
(groans quietly)

37:42.461 --> 37:44.430
(sighs):
So...

37:44.463 --> 37:46.698
how is your back?
Fine.

37:49.668 --> 37:51.503
So, we're gonna
process you here,

37:51.537 --> 37:53.405
but you're gonna get booked
down in juvenile hall,

37:53.439 --> 37:55.341
and that's where
your mom's gonna be

37:55.341 --> 37:56.442
waiting for
you, okay?

37:56.475 --> 37:57.743
Okay.

38:04.816 --> 38:06.852
You want to find
a minute,

38:06.885 --> 38:08.720
talk about what
happened out there?

38:08.754 --> 38:10.356
No.

38:12.858 --> 38:15.361
Hey, guys.

38:16.695 --> 38:18.997
Thank you.

38:20.098 --> 38:22.434
Sherman,

38:22.468 --> 38:24.403
captain's waiting.

38:27.406 --> 38:29.541
You sure you want to do
this task force thing?

38:29.575 --> 38:31.042
Yeah, man, it's going
to be great.

38:31.076 --> 38:33.044
It was a freaking blast.

38:33.078 --> 38:34.880
You two go way back, huh?

38:34.913 --> 38:37.549
The academy.
Patrol down at Newton.

38:37.583 --> 38:39.385
Way back, man.
We good?

38:39.385 --> 38:41.387
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah?

38:41.387 --> 38:43.389
*

38:47.859 --> 38:49.995
(whistles)
Oh, no!

38:50.028 --> 38:52.431
Uh-oh, man.
Que onda, brother, huh?

38:52.464 --> 38:54.099
How are you?
Come on, man.

38:54.132 --> 38:55.901
(laughing)
Hey, this is my brother
right here.

38:55.934 --> 38:57.669
Everybody say hello.

38:57.703 --> 38:59.405
Introduce yourselves.
I'm Nate.
Nice to meet you.

38:59.438 --> 39:01.440
All right, don't be shy.
Don't be shy.

39:01.473 --> 39:03.542
Hey, Mickey, right?

39:03.575 --> 39:05.143
No, no, some water.
Water, water.

39:05.176 --> 39:06.578
Que water, ni
water, man.

39:06.612 --> 39:08.480
Whiskeys all around.

39:08.514 --> 39:11.016
(indistinct chattering)

39:11.049 --> 39:12.851
So when I get there this morning

39:12.884 --> 39:15.854
the dude is putting
all your stuff in a box.

39:15.887 --> 39:17.055
Unbelievable.

39:17.088 --> 39:20.058
You know I told him
immediately to stop.

39:20.091 --> 39:22.060
You know what else
he tells me?

39:22.093 --> 39:24.563
That he asked
to work with me.

39:24.596 --> 39:27.566
He has some hookup
with upper management,

39:27.599 --> 39:29.535
can get
whatever he wants.

39:29.568 --> 39:32.438
Like that's supposed
to impress me.

39:32.438 --> 39:34.440
Lydia, I talked
to Fernandez.

39:34.440 --> 39:37.443
I told her
to box it all up.

39:38.710 --> 39:40.646
I didn't know that.

39:43.715 --> 39:46.685
Well, I guess
he did okay later.

39:46.718 --> 39:49.521
You know, he chased
the guy down

39:49.555 --> 39:50.856
pretty good
when he had to.

39:51.957 --> 39:54.726
I guess.

39:54.760 --> 39:56.762
Hey...

39:56.795 --> 39:58.730
I'm, like, pretty tired.

40:00.832 --> 40:02.468
I'm sorry. I've been going on.

40:02.501 --> 40:05.437
I'm going to go right now.

40:08.039 --> 40:09.975
I just miss you.

40:22.888 --> 40:24.823
(sobbing)

40:35.901 --> 40:37.836
(sighs)

40:39.571 --> 40:41.507
Russ...

40:46.678 --> 40:47.613
(sighs)

40:50.716 --> 40:53.685
Hey.

40:53.719 --> 40:56.154
Captain signed my book.

40:56.187 --> 40:57.989
Finished Phase Two.

40:58.023 --> 40:59.525
Yeah?
Yeah.

40:59.558 --> 41:01.527
Four months to go.

41:01.560 --> 41:04.530
Congratulations.

41:04.563 --> 41:07.533
So, want to grab a drink,
help me celebrate?

41:08.900 --> 41:10.836
Thanks.

41:12.838 --> 41:14.773
I think I'm just going
to head home.
Yeah.

41:19.878 --> 41:22.848
Captain was right
to sign your book.

41:22.881 --> 41:25.551
You're going to
be a great cop.

41:27.285 --> 41:29.220
(horn honking)

41:34.593 --> 41:36.562
Later, bro.

41:36.562 --> 41:38.564
(horn honking)
