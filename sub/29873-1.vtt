01:09.751 --> 01:10.702
Peyton?

01:10.738 --> 01:12.037
Delivery.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.405
Hey, Freddy! Great.

01:14.975 --> 01:17.442
It is so beautiful in here.

01:17.478 --> 01:18.577
Thank you.

01:18.612 --> 01:20.345
Are these for the party?

01:20.381 --> 01:23.215
No. No, that's just
a little extra Christmas magic.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.028
No, the party's got
a totally different theme.

01:25.052 --> 01:27.285
Well, everyone in town
is trying to guess what it is.

01:27.321 --> 01:28.321
Really?

01:29.990 --> 01:32.457
Ford Sherman's got a pool going
down at the hardware store.

01:33.694 --> 01:35.705
Well, everyone's gonna have
to wait until Christmas Eve.

01:35.729 --> 01:37.796
It's a surprise.

01:37.831 --> 01:39.271
I'll see
you and your wife there.

01:39.299 --> 01:40.339
She's already got a dress.

01:42.102 --> 01:44.469
"Buy... a... dress".

01:44.505 --> 01:45.904
Thank you for the reminder.

01:45.939 --> 01:46.705
Say hi to your folks from me.

01:46.740 --> 01:48.407
Will do.

02:17.104 --> 02:19.838
Great. We'll expect you
on the 6th.

02:19.873 --> 02:22.007
And you'll love
the Pine View suite.

02:22.042 --> 02:23.408
Okay.

02:23.444 --> 02:24.309
I ordered

02:24.344 --> 02:26.311
new Christmas stockings
for the staff.

02:26.346 --> 02:27.612
You think of everything.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.114
I try!

02:29.149 --> 02:32.951
The fire department
is having a toy drive.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.186
All right.

02:34.221 --> 02:36.955
Gotta buy them a toy.

02:38.692 --> 02:41.827
Mom, I can feel you worrying
from here.

02:41.862 --> 02:43.128
I'm just concerned

02:43.163 --> 02:44.641
that maybe you're taking on
too much.

02:44.665 --> 02:45.931
I'm fine.

02:45.966 --> 02:48.633
I can do the accounting stuff
in my sleep.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.547
And I know it's my first time
planning a party,

02:50.571 --> 02:53.038
but I am loving it.

02:53.073 --> 02:56.308
We just got
a whole bunch more RSVPs.

02:56.343 --> 02:59.678
This is gonna be
our biggest party ever.

02:59.713 --> 03:01.891
I really appreciate you letting
me plan it this year.

03:01.915 --> 03:03.815
And you're doing
a wonderful job.

03:03.851 --> 03:06.618
These would look so great

03:06.653 --> 03:09.688
hanging from
the fireplace mantle.

03:09.723 --> 03:11.523
Not another project.

03:11.558 --> 03:13.358
Mom!

03:13.393 --> 03:16.127
Get your sister to help you.

03:16.163 --> 03:18.230
- Love you guys.
- Love you, too.

03:20.734 --> 03:22.968
She is fine.

03:23.003 --> 03:24.747
She says she wants
to try event planning,

03:24.771 --> 03:26.149
we've got to give her
the chance.

03:26.173 --> 03:28.139
I know, but she's doing so much.

03:28.175 --> 03:29.107
Relax.

03:29.142 --> 03:31.676
Peyton has got this
totally under control.

03:38.285 --> 03:40.519
Jake, are you leaving town?

03:40.554 --> 03:41.731
There's a snowstorm
on the East Coast,

03:41.755 --> 03:42.721
and they're short-handed.

03:42.756 --> 03:45.423
But you'll be back
for Christmas, right?

03:45.459 --> 03:46.892
He promised.

03:46.927 --> 03:48.767
- I'll call you from Boston.
- Okay.

03:49.363 --> 03:50.795
Bye.

03:51.932 --> 03:52.731
Love you.

03:52.766 --> 03:54.299
I love you, too.

03:55.936 --> 03:57.435
I'm sorry.

03:57.471 --> 03:59.037
It's okay.
Gotta get used

03:59.072 --> 04:01.017
to a pilot's schedule
if I'm married to one now.

04:01.041 --> 04:02.908
But I've got a million things

04:02.943 --> 04:03.742
that I can do to keep busy.

04:03.777 --> 04:06.278
Well, do you want
a million and one?

04:06.313 --> 04:08.647
I gotta hang up
all these Christmas cards?

04:10.050 --> 04:11.983
I love this.

04:15.255 --> 04:16.855
What? What is it?

04:16.890 --> 04:18.490
It's... Ben Tyler.

04:19.660 --> 04:20.904
Did you know
he was back in town?

04:20.928 --> 04:22.394
Yeah, for, like, a year now.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.195
Where have I been?

04:24.231 --> 04:25.911
You've been married
and oblivious.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.466
Did you see him?

04:28.502 --> 04:30.869
No! I don't want to see him.

04:30.904 --> 04:32.771
It's been 10 years.

04:32.806 --> 04:34.472
Olivia. He left.

04:34.508 --> 04:36.141
I told him
I had feelings for him

04:36.176 --> 04:38.243
and he left for California
the next day.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.411
Maybe he changed.

04:39.446 --> 04:40.446
It doesn't matter.

04:40.480 --> 04:42.814
It was a silly little crush
and now it's over.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.384
What? What is that?

04:48.288 --> 04:49.899
You and Ben
were friends for a long time.

04:49.923 --> 04:51.501
He was a huge part of your life.

04:51.525 --> 04:53.158
You really don't miss him?

04:53.193 --> 04:54.426
At all?

04:54.461 --> 04:56.494
No. Not at all.

04:56.530 --> 04:57.530
Okay.

05:09.209 --> 05:10.775
Have a fun vacation, Dr. Tyler.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.243
Thanks, Louise.

05:12.279 --> 05:13.690
You have a wonderful Christmas
with your family.

05:13.714 --> 05:14.846
Thank you.

05:14.881 --> 05:17.516
<i>Paging Dr. Gillis.
Paging Dr. Gillis.</i>

05:20.320 --> 05:21.519
- Dad?
- Ben!

05:21.555 --> 05:22.587
Hey.

05:22.623 --> 05:24.033
I was hoping you could stop by.

05:24.057 --> 05:26.124
What time's your flight
to Honduras?

05:26.159 --> 05:27.971
Not until 7:00.
I've got plenty of time.

05:27.995 --> 05:30.195
Yes, but it's always good...

05:30.230 --> 05:31.429
- To be early.
- I know.

05:32.733 --> 05:33.843
Dr. Camran's going to love you.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.166
Yeah. Hey, dad, listen...

05:35.202 --> 05:37.135
I didn't say anything
to the staff.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.648
I told them
I was going on a diving trip.

05:38.672 --> 05:39.738
Why?

05:39.773 --> 05:43.008
Well, I didn't want
to make a big deal out of it,

05:43.043 --> 05:44.187
especially if
I don't get the job.

05:44.211 --> 05:45.176
Well, fair enough,

05:45.212 --> 05:47.812
but I'll bet you
Camran hires you on the spot.

05:47.848 --> 05:50.281
This is a great opportunity
for you in Honduras.

05:50.317 --> 05:53.018
Doctor's Care International
is a fantastic group.

05:53.053 --> 05:54.853
Yeah, it really is.

05:54.888 --> 05:56.655
I'm really proud of you.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.356
Thank you.

05:58.392 --> 05:59.791
When do you head to Vermont?

05:59.826 --> 06:00.992
Christmas day.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.527
Can't wait to hit the slopes.

06:02.562 --> 06:03.728
Catch up when I get back?

06:03.764 --> 06:05.196
Yeah, I'd like that.

06:05.232 --> 06:06.331
Have a merry Christmas.

06:06.366 --> 06:07.432
Yeah. You too, son.

06:24.918 --> 06:26.718
<i>Party supplies. Can I help you?</i>

06:26.753 --> 06:27.986
Hi. How are you?

06:28.021 --> 06:28.920
Listen, I'm coming in

06:28.955 --> 06:30.867
to pick up some party supplies
right now,

06:30.891 --> 06:32.435
but it's a little bit slippery
out here,

06:32.459 --> 06:34.059
so I'm taking it real slow.

06:35.362 --> 06:37.028
<i>Don't worry.
We'll be here.</i>

06:37.064 --> 06:39.330
All right, great, thank you.
See you soon.

07:19.072 --> 07:20.038
Peyton Canaday.

07:20.073 --> 07:21.306
Hi, Ben.

07:21.341 --> 07:22.807
- Hi.
- How are you?

07:22.843 --> 07:24.242
You look... you look well.

07:26.146 --> 07:27.746
Are you okay?

07:27.781 --> 07:29.114
Yeah. I'm fine.

07:31.752 --> 07:35.220
This is gonna sound crazy,
but did you see a reindeer?

07:35.255 --> 07:36.521
I did!

07:37.791 --> 07:39.457
Where'd it go?

07:39.493 --> 07:41.993
I don't know. Looked like
he was running from something.

07:42.028 --> 07:43.695
Like what?

07:44.998 --> 07:46.064
Like a girl reindeer

07:46.099 --> 07:48.077
who was trying to tell him
she had feelings for him.

07:48.101 --> 07:49.234
Sorry, what?

07:49.269 --> 07:50.902
What?

07:50.937 --> 07:52.470
Nothing.

07:54.641 --> 07:55.573
Great to see you.

07:55.609 --> 07:57.041
- Yeah.
- 'Kay.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.013
Need a ride?

08:35.148 --> 08:36.181
Yeah.

08:36.216 --> 08:38.183
I think I do. Thank you.

08:38.217 --> 08:40.150
Sure. No problem.
Come on.

08:44.324 --> 08:46.191
You going...
You going to the gym?

08:46.226 --> 08:47.826
Airport.

08:49.663 --> 08:50.728
Is that okay?

08:50.764 --> 08:51.830
That's fine.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.231
That's great.

08:53.266 --> 08:56.835
I should call the repair shop,
see if they'll grab my car.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.837
Sure.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.592
The repair shop read your mind.

09:02.342 --> 09:03.541
Dr. Tyler.

09:04.845 --> 09:06.578
When?

09:06.613 --> 09:08.179
Okay, no,
thanks for letting me know.

09:08.215 --> 09:09.380
Yeah, I'll come right in.

09:09.416 --> 09:10.281
What's the matter?

09:10.317 --> 09:13.251
Ford Sherman.
There was an accident.

09:13.286 --> 09:14.485
He's in the hospital.

09:15.689 --> 09:17.522
Oh, gosh. Okay. Come on.

09:23.029 --> 09:25.830
Dr. Tyler? I thought you were
on your way to Honduras.

09:25.866 --> 09:27.532
Honduras?

09:27.567 --> 09:28.700
Vacation.

09:28.735 --> 09:31.269
Ford Sherman is here?

09:31.304 --> 09:32.837
He's in exam room three.

09:32.873 --> 09:34.417
- What happened?
- He fell off a ladder.

09:34.441 --> 09:35.840
They just x-rayed his knee.

09:35.876 --> 09:37.516
And his daughter's
in the lounge.

09:38.612 --> 09:40.492
- I'll go check on Lily.
- I'll find Ford.

09:47.988 --> 09:50.221
Those are
beautiful drawings, Lily.

09:50.257 --> 09:51.856
- Peyton!
- Hi.

09:53.727 --> 09:56.694
Listen, everything's
gonna be okay.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.307
Dr. Ben just went
to check on your dad,

09:58.331 --> 10:00.298
and he's basically
the smartest guy I know.

10:00.333 --> 10:02.200
Nothing to worry about,
all right?

10:02.235 --> 10:03.534
Okay.

10:03.570 --> 10:05.770
Okay. What are you doing here?

10:05.805 --> 10:07.906
That looks like one

10:07.941 --> 10:10.308
of the gingerbread men
your mom used to make.

10:10.343 --> 10:12.443
The ones with buttons
made out of gumdrops.

10:12.479 --> 10:13.745
Only the red ones!

10:13.780 --> 10:16.547
Right, because you don't like
the green.

10:19.986 --> 10:22.654
You fell off a ladder? Really?

10:22.689 --> 10:25.490
I was hanging Christmas lights,
my knee gave out.

10:25.525 --> 10:26.557
It was a stupid accident.

10:26.593 --> 10:28.170
Yeah, 'cause most of
your accidents are so smart,

10:28.194 --> 10:29.939
like that time
you biked right into the tree?

10:29.963 --> 10:31.162
It was genius.

10:31.197 --> 10:32.897
I forgot how funny you aren't.

10:32.933 --> 10:33.798
Hey, James.

10:33.833 --> 10:35.678
Thanks for taking care
of my buddy here.

10:35.702 --> 10:37.769
Give me some good news, doc.

10:37.804 --> 10:40.171
Looks like you tore the acl
on your bad knee.

10:41.107 --> 10:43.019
Not to get too technical,
but it's a mess.

10:43.043 --> 10:44.676
It'll need surgery.

10:44.711 --> 10:46.811
But that can happen
after Christmas, right?

10:46.846 --> 10:49.080
No.
We need to treat this now.

10:49.115 --> 10:50.748
Aw, man.

10:50.784 --> 10:51.827
If we don't treat this
immediately,

10:51.851 --> 10:53.663
you could permanently lose
the use of your knee.

10:53.687 --> 10:54.953
How soon can you do it?

10:54.988 --> 10:56.666
We have to wait for
the swelling to go down,

10:56.690 --> 10:59.991
so we'll get Ford here a room
and reassess tomorrow.

11:00.026 --> 11:01.326
See you in the morning, Ford.

11:01.361 --> 11:02.293
Thanks, James.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.128
Thanks.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.964
- Well...
- All right, I'm outta here.

11:06.837 --> 11:08.144
What are you doing?

11:08.168 --> 11:09.545
I can wait for the swelling
to go down at home.

11:09.569 --> 11:10.535
Are you kidding me?

11:10.570 --> 11:12.181
You've been ignoring this thing
for a year.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.215
Yeah, well, I'm gonna
ignore it a little longer.

11:13.239 --> 11:15.707
He wasn't kidding around.
Ford, this is serious.

11:15.742 --> 11:17.382
You're risking
permanent damage here.

11:18.645 --> 11:20.790
Listen, you're probably right,
but it's just...

11:20.814 --> 11:22.680
No, no, no, no, no.
No "buts".

11:22.716 --> 11:23.748
Be smart about this.

11:23.783 --> 11:26.451
I'm at your disposal.
I don't fly out till 7:00.

11:26.486 --> 11:28.553
I can run errands.
I can do paperwork.

11:28.588 --> 11:29.799
I can check in
at the hardware store,

11:29.823 --> 11:30.755
whatever you need.

11:30.790 --> 11:33.524
What I need is someone
to look after Lily.

11:34.661 --> 11:35.393
What?

11:35.428 --> 11:36.806
I'm not worried about the store.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.463
That's fine,
Frank can handle that,

11:38.498 --> 11:40.064
but I need someone with Lily.

11:40.100 --> 11:40.999
What about your sister?

11:41.034 --> 11:42.578
You don't think
she'd be a better choice?

11:42.602 --> 11:44.080
She's out of state
with her in-laws.

11:44.104 --> 11:45.870
I know it's a big ask.

11:45.905 --> 11:47.005
You're leaving town.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.072
No. Hey, hey!

11:48.108 --> 11:49.307
Come on.

11:49.342 --> 11:50.508
Not another word.

11:50.543 --> 11:52.410
I will look after Lily.

11:52.445 --> 11:54.345
I can postpone the flight, yeah.

11:54.381 --> 11:55.713
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

11:55.749 --> 11:58.016
Thanks, man.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.183
One more thing?

12:00.620 --> 12:02.398
We do a lot of these
family traditions.

12:02.422 --> 12:03.654
Lily loves them,

12:03.690 --> 12:05.267
and I've been trying
to keep them going

12:05.291 --> 12:06.924
since Patsy passed.

12:06.960 --> 12:09.560
So, I need you to be
the Christmas guy.

12:09.596 --> 12:11.036
Can you do that, for me?

12:12.198 --> 12:13.264
You know I can.

12:13.299 --> 12:15.199
Thanks, man.

12:17.437 --> 12:19.604
Are those snowflake lights?

12:19.639 --> 12:22.040
Special ones for the porch.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.608
Daddy's putting them up tonight.

12:23.643 --> 12:25.109
Hey. There's my girl.

12:25.145 --> 12:26.177
Daddy!

12:26.212 --> 12:27.612
Ford! How are you?

12:27.647 --> 12:30.848
I'm gonna be just fine.

12:30.884 --> 12:32.283
But...

12:32.318 --> 12:33.462
I have to stay here
a couple days

12:33.486 --> 12:34.630
so the doctors can fix my knee.

12:34.654 --> 12:36.421
However,

12:36.456 --> 12:38.200
uncle Ben's gonna take you home
and hang with you

12:38.224 --> 12:38.956
while I'm gone.

12:38.992 --> 12:40.425
- Really?
- Really?

12:40.460 --> 12:43.361
Come on. It'll be fun.

12:43.396 --> 12:45.997
You know who makes pancakes
shaped like a stethoscope?

12:46.933 --> 12:49.333
This guy.

12:55.942 --> 12:59.043
So, Lily...

12:59.079 --> 13:01.946
Your dad tells me you have
some Christmas traditions.

13:01.981 --> 13:03.981
Do you have a list?

13:04.017 --> 13:05.817
Drawings.
Can I show you guys?

13:05.852 --> 13:08.119
Absolutely.

13:11.658 --> 13:14.459
Hey. You've got this, right?

13:15.628 --> 13:16.894
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

13:16.930 --> 13:17.895
Okay, good.

13:17.931 --> 13:19.931
Hey, Lily. Come here.
Give me a hug goodbye.

13:19.966 --> 13:23.034
Can't you stay a little longer?
Please?

13:24.003 --> 13:25.570
I mean, at least

13:25.605 --> 13:26.949
let me make you a cup of coffee.

13:26.973 --> 13:29.107
You never come over anymore.

13:33.847 --> 13:35.613
Yeah, I can stay for a minute.

13:36.616 --> 13:38.749
Just grab my purse.

13:44.457 --> 13:46.424
You thought you'd be
on the beach in Honduras,

13:46.459 --> 13:48.204
and now you're taking care
of a little girl.

13:48.228 --> 13:49.861
You gonna cancel your trip?

13:49.896 --> 13:51.774
No, no, no, just postpone it
a few days.

13:51.798 --> 13:53.297
Okay.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.366
Man, I love this old place.

13:55.401 --> 13:56.434
Me too.

14:03.643 --> 14:05.143
Okay.

14:15.221 --> 14:16.921
I miss you, Pats.

14:19.492 --> 14:21.826
Here are all the drawings
I did at the hospital.

14:27.901 --> 14:30.201
These are
all your Christmas traditions?

14:30.236 --> 14:31.369
No. There's more.

14:38.778 --> 14:40.418
Dad and I have already
done some of these.

14:41.881 --> 14:42.980
So...

14:43.016 --> 14:44.382
Presents?

14:44.417 --> 14:46.317
Homemade presents.

14:46.352 --> 14:48.753
Mom always said
homemade presents are the best.

14:48.788 --> 14:50.521
Last year,
I gave dad a keychain,

14:50.557 --> 14:52.557
and socks,

14:52.592 --> 14:54.692
but I didn't make the socks.

14:55.895 --> 14:56.895
Okay.

14:58.064 --> 14:59.897
And what is this one?

14:59.933 --> 15:01.365
Cookies for my teacher.

15:01.401 --> 15:04.035
We need to buy some gumdrops.

15:04.070 --> 15:06.470
See if you can get
a package with lots of red ones.

15:07.373 --> 15:08.839
Good note.

15:11.277 --> 15:13.411
And... what...

15:13.446 --> 15:15.079
What's this one?

15:15.114 --> 15:15.913
Reindeer food.

15:15.949 --> 15:18.049
I'm sorry, what?

15:18.084 --> 15:21.185
You know...
Reindeer food. Oats and hay.

15:21.221 --> 15:22.787
And glitter.
Edible glitter.

15:22.822 --> 15:24.622
That's right.
Santa gets cookies and milk.

15:24.657 --> 15:25.856
Reindeer get reindeer food.

15:25.892 --> 15:27.858
Exactly.

15:30.296 --> 15:32.296
And where do we get the glitter?

15:32.332 --> 15:34.799
The candy store downtown.
They'll have the gumdrops, too.

15:34.834 --> 15:37.235
And if you drop my name
at the hobby shop,

15:37.270 --> 15:38.380
they'll give you a discount
on art supplies.

15:38.404 --> 15:39.971
Art supplies?

15:40.006 --> 15:42.506
For the homemade gifts.

15:43.576 --> 15:44.942
Right.

15:46.145 --> 15:48.479
You guys are gonna have
so much fun.

15:48.514 --> 15:52.450
Can we hang
the snowflake lights tonight?

15:53.686 --> 15:55.319
Sure.

15:55.355 --> 15:57.455
Mom always
hangs snowflake lights

15:57.490 --> 16:01.892
the day before we put up
the big tree, and that's...

16:01.928 --> 16:03.094
Tomorrow.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.729
Tomorrow?

16:06.866 --> 16:07.765
Big tree.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.400
Got it.

16:14.707 --> 16:16.774
They need me at the Inn.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.277
All right, Lily.
I'm gonna go. I'll see you soon.

16:19.312 --> 16:22.613
- Bye.
- Bye.

16:22.649 --> 16:23.914
Hey, Peyton.

16:25.385 --> 16:27.685
Can I, talk to you for a second?

16:27.720 --> 16:29.086
Yeah.

16:30.189 --> 16:31.389
Thank you.

16:33.526 --> 16:35.526
What's up?

16:35.561 --> 16:37.273
What are you doing
for the next few days?

16:37.297 --> 16:39.764
My job

16:39.799 --> 16:41.777
and throwing the Inn's
biggest Christmas party ever.

16:41.801 --> 16:42.833
Right.

16:42.869 --> 16:44.201
Why?

16:44.237 --> 16:47.171
I could really use
your help here.

16:49.976 --> 16:52.777
You know what, I wish I could,
but I don't have time.

16:52.812 --> 16:54.652
You remember when I said
I got this?

16:55.181 --> 16:56.614
I don't got this.

16:56.649 --> 16:59.884
This is so much bigger
than baking cookies

16:59.919 --> 17:01.952
and green gumdrops.

17:01.988 --> 17:04.288
Red gumdrops.

17:04.324 --> 17:05.955
Right.

17:05.992 --> 17:08.125
This is about
what Patsy created.

17:08.161 --> 17:10.372
I don't want to mess it up,
I don't want to disappoint Lily.

17:10.396 --> 17:11.996
Ben, you're a doctor.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.009
I'm sure you're smart enough
to figure this out.

17:14.032 --> 17:15.465
I order a tie online

17:15.501 --> 17:17.167
and send it
to my dad's hotel room...

17:17.203 --> 17:19.337
That's about as close
to tradition as I get.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.472
Please...

17:21.507 --> 17:22.540
Peyton, I need you.

17:24.711 --> 17:27.678
Come on, this is
our best friend's little girl.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.758
Lily deserves every tradition
on that list.

17:29.782 --> 17:32.550
If you honestly think
that I can handle this,

17:32.585 --> 17:33.884
on my own,

17:33.920 --> 17:35.520
I'll go back inside right now.

17:36.756 --> 17:38.556
I...

17:39.559 --> 17:41.459
I...

17:55.074 --> 17:58.008
Hey, Lily?

17:58.044 --> 17:59.855
Would it be okay if I hung out
for a couple of days

17:59.879 --> 18:01.245
and helped out?

18:01.280 --> 18:03.914
Yea-a-a-ah!

18:03.950 --> 18:05.483
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

18:07.820 --> 18:10.054
I gotta just call my parents
at the Inn

18:10.089 --> 18:12.156
and tell them what's going on.

18:25.772 --> 18:26.670
Here, we have

18:26.706 --> 18:29.106
the Sherman family
Christmas traditions,

18:29.142 --> 18:30.608
with artwork by...

18:32.311 --> 18:34.945
...Lily Sherman!

18:34.981 --> 18:36.480
It's a Christmas masterpiece.

18:36.516 --> 18:37.516
So what do we do first?

18:41.821 --> 18:43.020
Snowflake lights!

18:44.824 --> 18:46.424
Someone's got
the Christmas spirit.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.293
And no coat on.

18:49.328 --> 18:50.461
I'm on it.

18:50.496 --> 18:51.595
I'll be right out.

18:51.631 --> 18:52.963
Okay.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.568
<i>Hello?</i>

18:57.603 --> 19:00.171
Dr. Camran, hi.
Dr. Ben Tyler.

19:00.206 --> 19:01.439
Hi, how are you?

19:01.474 --> 19:02.840
<i>I'm good, thank you.</i>

19:02.875 --> 19:05.576
Listen,
I have a little bad news.

19:05.611 --> 19:07.144
I have to delay our interview.

19:07.180 --> 19:09.480
Is there a problem?

19:09.515 --> 19:10.648
<i>Your father said you were</i>

19:10.683 --> 19:11.549
<i>very interested in the position.</i>

19:11.584 --> 19:13.584
No, I'm definitely
still interested.

19:13.619 --> 19:15.459
I have to look after
my friend's daughter

19:15.488 --> 19:17.188
while he's in surgery.

19:17.223 --> 19:18.667
It'll just take
a couple of days,

19:18.691 --> 19:21.258
and I will let you know
as soon as I know more.

19:21.294 --> 19:23.694
Well, I'm sorry to hear
about your friend,

19:23.729 --> 19:25.095
<i>and I do understand,</i>

19:25.131 --> 19:27.097
<i>but we really need
to find someone</i>

19:27.133 --> 19:28.877
<i>who can be on-site
at the beginning of the year.</i>

19:28.901 --> 19:32.002
<i>We can't put off
making a decision for too long.</i>

19:33.139 --> 19:34.371
I understand.

19:34.407 --> 19:36.507
<i>Thank you.</i>

19:41.481 --> 19:43.280
Well, here we go!

19:43.316 --> 19:44.548
I finished first, I win.

19:44.584 --> 19:46.217
Think again.

19:46.252 --> 19:48.486
I'm finished, which means I win.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.454
No, you're not.

19:50.490 --> 19:51.822
"Watt"...

19:51.858 --> 19:53.023
An honor.

19:53.059 --> 19:55.659
I can feel the power...

19:55.695 --> 19:57.962
It's... electrifying.

19:59.165 --> 20:00.576
Please, please,
stop with the puns.

20:00.600 --> 20:03.334
Keep... keep us in the dark.

20:03.369 --> 20:04.869
All right.

20:04.904 --> 20:06.237
Here we go!

20:06.272 --> 20:08.205
Ha, ha!

20:09.709 --> 20:11.687
You might want to plug it
into the outlet.

20:11.711 --> 20:14.345
Well, guess I'm just a dim bulb.

20:16.082 --> 20:17.681
Do you guys like each other?

20:19.185 --> 20:20.351
- 'Course.
- Yeah.

20:20.386 --> 20:21.118
- Yeah.
- Of course.

20:21.153 --> 20:23.187
Do you guys wanna get married?

20:23.222 --> 20:24.388
- No.
- No.

20:24.423 --> 20:25.489
Absolutely not.

20:25.525 --> 20:26.290
No, no, no, no.

20:26.325 --> 20:27.402
- No, no, no.
- No, we're friends.

20:27.426 --> 20:30.327
We've been friends
since grade school.

20:30.363 --> 20:33.864
Speaking of school,
do you have school tomorrow?

20:33.900 --> 20:35.866
No. It's winter break.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.835
You gotta love winter break.

20:38.771 --> 20:40.938
What do you say,
should we see some lights?

20:40.973 --> 20:42.573
- Yes, please.
- Yeah.

20:50.716 --> 20:52.683
Come see!

20:59.258 --> 21:01.892
What should we do next?

21:01.928 --> 21:02.893
Dinner!

21:02.929 --> 21:03.929
Dinner.

21:14.774 --> 21:15.873
Lily's great,

21:15.908 --> 21:17.875
but how do people with kids
do it?

21:17.910 --> 21:19.610
Babysitters?

21:25.318 --> 21:27.051
Paper snowflakes.

21:27.086 --> 21:28.586
Snowflake lights.

21:28.621 --> 21:31.055
I'm sensing a pattern here.

21:31.090 --> 21:34.892
Yeah, but look at these.
These are so pretty.

21:34.927 --> 21:36.794
Gosh, I haven't
made paper snowflakes

21:36.829 --> 21:37.728
since I was a kid.

21:37.763 --> 21:40.331
Yeah, it's a whole new skillset
for me.

21:40.366 --> 21:41.999
Lily's a great teacher,

21:42.034 --> 21:43.734
but I think we need a new plan.

21:43.769 --> 21:44.902
How about this...

21:44.937 --> 21:46.448
I'll do the cooking
and cleaning,

21:46.472 --> 21:48.305
you do the Christmas stuff.

21:48.341 --> 21:50.741
No, you need to participate
in the Christmas stuff.

21:50.776 --> 21:52.743
I've got the Inn's party
to plan, remember?

21:53.779 --> 21:54.878
What?

21:55.848 --> 21:56.981
What's wrong?

21:57.016 --> 22:02.653
I just don't have a lot
of experience with this stuff.

22:02.688 --> 22:03.832
I was with my dad for Christmas,

22:03.856 --> 22:05.667
but we were always going
on work trips.

22:05.691 --> 22:06.557
He's a great guy,

22:06.592 --> 22:08.792
but he does not have
the triple-h gene.

22:08.828 --> 22:10.494
"Triple-h"?

22:10.529 --> 22:12.262
Ho, ho, ho.

22:12.298 --> 22:14.465
Right. That...
That gene, yeah.

22:16.135 --> 22:19.169
Well... who knows?

22:19.205 --> 22:22.640
Maybe this is the year
you find your Christmas spirit.

22:22.675 --> 22:24.141
You never know.

22:40.493 --> 22:42.459
Really?

22:47.700 --> 22:48.966
Morning.

22:49.001 --> 22:50.634
Hi.

22:50.670 --> 22:52.670
How'd you sleep?

22:52.705 --> 22:55.339
Every time I heard a sound,
I was worried it was Lily.

22:56.275 --> 22:58.475
Me too.
I checked on her three times.

22:58.511 --> 23:00.222
I'm not used to worrying
about someone.

23:00.246 --> 23:01.246
Me neither.

23:01.280 --> 23:03.847
And it's kind of nice.

23:05.084 --> 23:06.984
So, what's the plan for today?

23:07.019 --> 23:09.820
Well, I need to go by the Inn,
try to get some work done,

23:09.855 --> 23:11.500
and then I'm gonna
swing by my apartment

23:11.524 --> 23:12.556
and get some clothes.

23:12.591 --> 23:13.557
What about you?

23:13.592 --> 23:15.570
I think I'm gonna bring Lily
by the hospital

23:15.594 --> 23:16.694
and check on Ford.

23:16.729 --> 23:18.862
She's gonna love that.

23:18.898 --> 23:21.265
You should take some decorations
for his room,

23:21.300 --> 23:22.700
give it a little Christmas.

23:22.735 --> 23:24.168
More Christmas?

23:24.203 --> 23:25.536
Work with me.

23:26.539 --> 23:27.871
Fair enough.

23:27.907 --> 23:29.006
You coming?

23:29.041 --> 23:30.674
Coming where?

23:30.710 --> 23:32.876
Lily wants us to meet Miranda.

23:32.912 --> 23:35.379
Who's Miranda?

23:35.414 --> 23:37.414
This is Miranda.

23:37.450 --> 23:39.850
I got her for my birthday.

23:39.885 --> 23:42.019
Hi, Miranda.

23:42.054 --> 23:44.054
You're beautiful.

23:46.225 --> 23:47.524
She likes you.

23:47.560 --> 23:48.525
There're some carrots
over there,

23:48.561 --> 23:49.561
if you want to feed her.

23:52.565 --> 23:54.598
All right, mister.
You're up.

23:54.633 --> 23:56.111
Hold your hand out
with your palm flat.

23:56.135 --> 23:57.935
I'm not so good with horses.

23:57.970 --> 23:58.970
She won't bite.

24:02.575 --> 24:04.541
She likes you, too.

24:04.577 --> 24:06.310
You're a natural!

24:06.345 --> 24:08.212
Now it's time for her breakfast.

24:08.247 --> 24:09.891
Okay, well, Ben can
help you with your chores.

24:09.915 --> 24:11.126
- I'm gonna go to work.
- No, no.

24:11.150 --> 24:12.416
I need backup.

24:12.451 --> 24:13.884
I'm only up to carrots.

24:13.919 --> 24:16.386
What? Come on.
You can handle this.

24:18.657 --> 24:20.090
What's that, Miranda?

24:20.126 --> 24:21.625
You are so right!

24:21.660 --> 24:23.560
What an intelligent horse.

24:23.596 --> 24:25.596
Peyton should stay and help out.

24:25.631 --> 24:27.231
Miranda, come on.

24:27.266 --> 24:29.466
He's got this
under control, right?

24:31.971 --> 24:34.438
Miranda says no.

24:36.208 --> 24:38.442
Way to have a girl's back,
Miranda.

24:38.477 --> 24:39.688
You know what?
Now you're in charge.

24:39.712 --> 24:41.478
I'm gonna go to work.
Bye.

24:41.514 --> 24:43.280
Bye!

24:54.059 --> 24:55.926
Hi! Sorry I'm late.

24:55.961 --> 24:57.773
I had to swing by my place
and get a change of clothes.

24:57.797 --> 24:59.463
- How's Lily?
- She's great.

24:59.498 --> 25:00.531
Is Olivia here?

25:00.566 --> 25:02.833
I needed her to make up
some sample appetizers.

25:02.868 --> 25:05.669
She's been cooking non-stop
since Jake left yesterday.

25:05.704 --> 25:08.172
I better get in there.

25:08.207 --> 25:09.973
Peyton?

25:10.009 --> 25:12.476
Do you need help with anything?

25:12.511 --> 25:14.411
No, I got it all right here.

25:18.517 --> 25:21.118
Okay. So you're helping Lily,
which is lovely,

25:21.153 --> 25:23.320
but that also means
you're spending a lot of time

25:23.355 --> 25:26.156
with Dr. Ben Tyler,
who you're not very fond of.

25:26.192 --> 25:27.457
He's not so bad.

25:29.528 --> 25:30.828
It's not a big deal.

25:30.863 --> 25:31.695
We are friends,

25:31.730 --> 25:33.475
and we're never gonna be
anything more.

25:33.499 --> 25:35.833
We're doing this for Lily,
remember?

25:37.703 --> 25:40.404
Gosh, what is this?
It smells incredible.

25:40.439 --> 25:43.040
That is a water chestnut
soaked in maple,

25:43.075 --> 25:43.907
wrapped in apple-smoked bacon,

25:43.943 --> 25:46.677
with a little dollop
of blue cheese.

25:46.712 --> 25:48.378
You just said
all my favorite things

25:48.414 --> 25:49.479
in one sentence.

25:50.616 --> 25:52.149
Where do you get these ideas?

25:52.184 --> 25:54.151
I was up late
looking at recipes online.

25:56.021 --> 25:57.154
It relaxes me.

25:57.189 --> 26:00.224
Did you know there are over
200 million bacon recipes?

26:00.259 --> 26:01.692
People love bacon.

26:01.727 --> 26:04.428
Are you okay?
Do you want to talk about it?

26:04.463 --> 26:05.574
No. But you're gonna be late.

26:05.598 --> 26:06.608
You should come back for lunch,

26:06.632 --> 26:08.866
'cause I'm gonna make
a bacon-tomato sandwich

26:08.901 --> 26:10.100
that's gonna blow your mind.

26:10.135 --> 26:11.935
- Done. I'll be here.
- Perfect.

26:14.473 --> 26:16.039
Whoa, Lily.

26:16.075 --> 26:17.519
I think this one's
your best one yet.

26:17.543 --> 26:18.842
I think so, too.

26:20.312 --> 26:23.280
So... surgery tomorrow.

26:23.315 --> 26:25.382
Yeah, that's what they say.

26:25.417 --> 26:26.683
How's it going at home?

26:26.719 --> 26:28.585
Yeah, I'm learning.

26:28.621 --> 26:29.419
- Yeah?
- I had no idea

26:29.455 --> 26:31.622
that food on a plate
doesn't touch,

26:31.657 --> 26:32.734
including orange chicken
and rice.

26:32.758 --> 26:34.691
Very important.

26:34.727 --> 26:35.626
Peyton made a note.

26:35.661 --> 26:36.526
Yeah,

26:36.562 --> 26:39.463
she called me,
said she was helping out.

26:39.498 --> 26:40.697
Yeah.

26:40.733 --> 26:41.698
How's that going?

26:41.734 --> 26:43.200
Fine.

26:43.235 --> 26:44.235
Yeah?

26:44.270 --> 26:45.235
What? It's fine.

26:45.271 --> 26:46.403
They're friends.

26:46.438 --> 26:47.537
Oh, yeah? Okay.

26:47.573 --> 26:48.605
Since when?

26:48.641 --> 26:49.907
Since grade school.

26:49.942 --> 26:52.109
Since grade school,
okay, all right.

26:52.144 --> 26:54.745
Just checking in
with you and Peyton.

26:54.780 --> 26:56.113
Which knee was it again?

26:56.148 --> 26:57.188
Okay, all right, I'm done.

26:59.652 --> 27:01.718
So that was
maybe 15 years ago and...

27:01.754 --> 27:02.819
Peyton.

27:02.855 --> 27:03.987
This is Miles Kowski.

27:04.023 --> 27:06.256
He's a new reporter
for the Birch Creek Gazette.

27:06.292 --> 27:07.736
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

27:07.760 --> 27:08.692
Yeah, he's doing

27:08.727 --> 27:10.827
a feature article on the Inn
and our party.

27:10.863 --> 27:12.896
For the Gazette's
special Christmas day edition.

27:12.932 --> 27:14.798
That's exciting.

27:14.833 --> 27:15.877
I'm excited to be on the story.

27:15.901 --> 27:18.168
This party is all
anyone in town's talking about.

27:18.203 --> 27:19.970
25 years is a long time.

27:20.005 --> 27:21.972
Well, this year,
Peyton is handling

27:22.007 --> 27:23.340
all the event planning for it.

27:23.375 --> 27:25.120
So you're the event planner
for the Inn?

27:25.144 --> 27:27.344
Well, no, not normally.
I'm the accountant.

27:27.379 --> 27:28.679
But I'm moving on to events.

27:29.648 --> 27:30.648
She's being modest.

27:30.683 --> 27:31.982
But what you have to see

27:32.017 --> 27:33.283
is the ballroom.

27:33.319 --> 27:34.651
Well, lead the way.

27:34.687 --> 27:35.986
No. No! No.

27:36.021 --> 27:38.588
No. Not ready.

27:38.624 --> 27:39.834
Everyone's trying
to guess the theme.

27:39.858 --> 27:40.924
Can you give me a hint?

27:40.960 --> 27:43.160
I cannot. No.

27:44.496 --> 27:46.463
You're gonna find out
on Christmas Eve.

27:46.498 --> 27:48.432
Well, you know, to be fair,

27:48.467 --> 27:49.827
she hasn't even told
me or her mom.

27:51.070 --> 27:53.103
But I'm sure
it's gonna be great.

27:53.138 --> 27:55.172
I am positive as well.

27:55.207 --> 27:56.873
You know what I can show you...

27:56.909 --> 28:00.510
I do have some photos from...

28:07.820 --> 28:10.821
And the big, magical
holiday theme

28:10.856 --> 28:12.656
for this year's party is...

28:17.997 --> 28:19.830
Nothing.

28:32.945 --> 28:34.945
And now that one goes
over there,

28:34.980 --> 28:36.113
on top of that one.

28:36.148 --> 28:37.848
You're sure about this?

28:37.883 --> 28:40.484
Yeah.

28:41.620 --> 28:42.620
You'll see.

28:45.824 --> 28:49.226
And now you put that one
on top of that one.

28:49.261 --> 28:51.428
That can't be right.

28:51.463 --> 28:53.263
You'll see.

28:53.298 --> 28:54.765
Okay.

28:56.068 --> 28:58.068
Oh... boy.

29:04.276 --> 29:06.209
Now turn around
and let me finish it.

29:18.957 --> 29:20.223
Are you almost done?

29:20.259 --> 29:22.259
I can't wait to see
what you're up to.

29:23.462 --> 29:24.561
Finished!

29:28.167 --> 29:31.001
Your snowman
is doing a handstand.

29:31.036 --> 29:33.136
Yeah, mom taught me.

29:34.673 --> 29:36.907
That is so cute.

29:36.942 --> 29:39.142
I remember when I used
to make those with your mom.

29:40.179 --> 29:43.180
It is cold out here.

29:43.215 --> 29:44.626
Who wants to decorate
a Christmas tree?

29:44.650 --> 29:46.249
Me! Yes.

29:46.285 --> 29:48.285
Sounds great! Me too!

29:48.320 --> 29:49.820
Let's go!

29:52.191 --> 29:53.623
It's my favorite.

29:54.660 --> 29:58.428
You said that
about the last five ornaments.

29:58.464 --> 30:00.030
I love them all.

30:00.065 --> 30:02.099
You know, I've never heard
of decorating

30:02.134 --> 30:03.433
three different trees.

30:03.469 --> 30:06.603
Is that another
Sherman family tradition?

30:06.638 --> 30:09.506
Yup. First, we do the one
in front of the barn,

30:09.541 --> 30:10.774
and then the porch,

30:10.809 --> 30:13.276
and now the big tree.

30:13.312 --> 30:16.046
It is so beautiful.

30:16.081 --> 30:17.280
In fact,

30:17.316 --> 30:18.715
I think it might be time

30:18.750 --> 30:21.651
for the moment
we've all been waiting for.

30:21.687 --> 30:23.186
The lights.

30:24.156 --> 30:26.223
Now, we have
a very big decision to make.

30:26.258 --> 30:28.058
A very big decision.

30:28.093 --> 30:29.693
You see...

30:29.728 --> 30:32.963
There are those
who prefer clear...

30:35.167 --> 30:37.200
And there are those
who prefer...

30:37.236 --> 30:38.201
Multi-colored.

30:38.237 --> 30:40.470
Yeah!

30:40.506 --> 30:42.239
Let's see
those options one more time.

30:42.274 --> 30:43.206
Clear...

30:43.242 --> 30:44.374
And, wait for it...

30:45.544 --> 30:46.676
...multi-colored.

30:47.779 --> 30:49.713
It's Christmas magic.

30:49.748 --> 30:52.415
Clear, multi-colored,

30:52.451 --> 30:54.518
two perfectly good options.

30:54.553 --> 30:55.919
I say we take a vote.

30:55.954 --> 30:56.987
Clear.

30:57.022 --> 30:58.522
Multi-colored.

30:58.557 --> 31:00.056
We have ourselves a tie!

31:00.092 --> 31:01.591
Looks like the tie-breaker...

31:01.627 --> 31:02.637
...goes to Peyton Canaday!

31:02.661 --> 31:05.428
That means you're
the tie-breaker, Peyton Canaday.

31:05.464 --> 31:09.065
The entire fate of Christmas
rests in your hands.

31:11.470 --> 31:13.790
A hush falls over the crowd
while she weighs her options.

31:15.073 --> 31:16.406
Lily...

31:16.441 --> 31:18.542
Drum roll, please.

31:18.577 --> 31:20.343
And the winner

31:20.379 --> 31:23.046
is...

31:23.081 --> 31:24.714
Clear!

31:24.750 --> 31:27.250
...and... multicolored!

31:28.387 --> 31:29.452
The crowd goes wild!

31:33.058 --> 31:35.659
Maestro, a little music, please.

31:46.104 --> 31:48.438
I love this song!

31:48.473 --> 31:50.207
Lily, let's dance!

31:55.447 --> 31:57.214
Okay, twirl!

31:57.249 --> 31:58.815
And back again!

31:58.850 --> 31:59.850
Okay, big dip. Ready?

32:02.120 --> 32:03.987
Come on, Ben, let's dance!

32:04.022 --> 32:05.266
- No, no, no, no.
- He doesn't have to dance.

32:05.290 --> 32:06.923
I'm not a big da...

32:06.959 --> 32:08.519
He doesn't want to dance.
No, it's fine.

32:11.196 --> 32:13.430
Well...

32:17.135 --> 32:18.413
- Little spin?
- Oh, sure.

32:19.438 --> 32:20.270
And back.

32:20.305 --> 32:21.838
'Kay.

32:21.873 --> 32:24.107
- And a dip?
- Yep.

32:28.046 --> 32:32.315
Can I go put these
on the back door?

32:32.351 --> 32:33.583
Yes! Of course.

32:36.355 --> 32:38.099
- Did you hear a "ding"?
- I did, yeah.

32:38.123 --> 32:39.883
- That's my phone.
- I think it was, yeah.

32:54.673 --> 32:56.072
Is everything all right?

32:57.376 --> 33:00.343
Yeah.
Yeah, it's just this party.

33:00.379 --> 33:02.879
The famous Canaday party.

33:02.914 --> 33:05.114
It's all anyone at the hospital
can talk about.

33:09.021 --> 33:11.388
Ben, can I tell you
something that...

33:11.423 --> 33:12.622
That I haven't told anybody?

33:14.226 --> 33:16.459
I need a theme for the ballroom,

33:16.495 --> 33:18.228
and I got nothin'.

33:18.263 --> 33:19.963
I mean, I am stuck.

33:21.333 --> 33:22.832
You got time.

33:22.868 --> 33:24.345
I'm sure
you'll come up with something.

33:24.369 --> 33:27.070
I've got five days,
and the thing is,

33:27.105 --> 33:29.039
this is really, really
important to me.

33:29.074 --> 33:30.974
This is my chance to show
everybody

33:31.009 --> 33:32.976
that I'm more than
just an accountant.

33:33.011 --> 33:34.978
I want to be an event planner,

33:35.013 --> 33:37.013
and this is my chance
to prove to everybody

33:37.049 --> 33:38.014
that I can do it.

33:38.050 --> 33:39.050
But can I?

33:40.085 --> 33:42.319
Yes. I'm sure you can.

33:42.354 --> 33:44.321
I'm running out of time.

33:44.356 --> 33:47.757
And the Gazette's gonna run
a big story on Christmas day,

33:47.793 --> 33:50.026
and if I mess up,
my name's gonna be in the paper.

33:50.062 --> 33:51.861
You'll find your idea.

33:51.897 --> 33:53.737
They always come
when you least expect them.

33:53.765 --> 33:55.565
Why don't you try...

33:55.600 --> 33:58.034
Not thinking about it
for a while?

33:59.604 --> 34:01.471
I don't think that's gonna work.

34:02.774 --> 34:03.840
But I guess

34:03.875 --> 34:05.942
it couldn't be worse
than what I'm doing right now.

34:05.977 --> 34:08.178
Right.

34:08.213 --> 34:09.456
Why don't you
just have a little fun

34:09.481 --> 34:10.980
and see what happens.

34:12.484 --> 34:14.751
"See what happens".

34:22.226 --> 34:24.527
There she is.

34:28.734 --> 34:30.900
I miss daddy.

34:30.936 --> 34:32.369
Yeah, I bet you do.

34:32.404 --> 34:33.947
Well, they're fixing
his knee up tomorrow,

34:33.972 --> 34:35.938
and he'll be home
before Christmas.

34:35.974 --> 34:37.485
Yeah, he just needs
a couple more days

34:37.509 --> 34:39.109
for his leg to get better.

34:39.143 --> 34:42.712
You know, once, when
I was probably about your age,

34:42.748 --> 34:45.047
I spent Christmas with my aunt.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.250
And she got me a little
Christmas tree of my own,

34:47.284 --> 34:49.119
and she told me
that every light on it

34:49.154 --> 34:50.674
was for someone who loved me.

34:52.023 --> 34:54.657
Ben, can you read me a story?

34:54.693 --> 34:56.226
Yeah.

34:56.261 --> 34:58.061
Love to.

34:59.297 --> 35:00.730
What do we got?

35:00.766 --> 35:02.298
"Humphrey
the swimming reindeer".

35:06.338 --> 35:08.304
"Once upon a time,

35:08.340 --> 35:10.940
there was a reindeer
named Humphrey.

35:10.976 --> 35:14.444
But Humphrey didn't fly,

35:14.479 --> 35:16.413
he swam".

35:41.373 --> 35:45.008
"And Humphrey swam the toys
to the children on the island,

35:45.043 --> 35:48.645
and Christmas was saved.

35:48.680 --> 35:50.180
The end".

35:50.215 --> 35:52.682
That is a good story.

35:54.686 --> 35:56.019
Look what I found.

36:03.862 --> 36:07.063
Now, Ben, what did your aunt say
about the lights on the tree?

36:07.098 --> 36:08.031
She said

36:08.066 --> 36:11.401
that every light
is for someone who loves me.

36:14.873 --> 36:16.272
Goodnight, mommy.

36:17.409 --> 36:18.675
Goodnight, daddy.

36:48.139 --> 36:50.373
What were you doing up there?

36:50.408 --> 36:51.741
Nothing.

36:51.776 --> 36:53.243
What are you doing?

36:53.278 --> 36:56.246
It's a dollhouse
that Ford ordered for Lily.

36:56.281 --> 36:58.681
He asked
if we would put it together.

36:58.717 --> 37:01.184
What do you think?
You up for it?

37:01.219 --> 37:03.353
You bet.

37:11.129 --> 37:12.395
Scalpel.

37:16.134 --> 37:19.035
So your mom
is saving the whales?

37:19.070 --> 37:20.870
Yeah. She loves it.

37:20.906 --> 37:22.605
She's an amazing person.

37:22.641 --> 37:25.475
She sure is.
My dad is, too.

37:25.510 --> 37:27.477
He saves people.
She saves animals.

37:27.512 --> 37:28.811
They're both pretty amazing.

37:28.847 --> 37:30.527
They just weren't
amazing together.

37:34.586 --> 37:36.230
What are you working on
over there?

37:36.254 --> 37:38.755
Christmas decorations
for the dollhouse.

37:38.790 --> 37:39.989
You made that?

37:40.025 --> 37:40.890
Yeah.

37:40.926 --> 37:42.592
How?

37:42.627 --> 37:46.829
Ribbons, pipe cleaners,
old coffee stirrers...

37:46.865 --> 37:49.299
I raided Lily's craft box, so...

37:49.334 --> 37:50.199
Why are you laughing?

37:50.235 --> 37:51.646
We're not even finished
building it yet,

37:51.670 --> 37:52.914
and you've already decorated it.

37:52.938 --> 37:53.903
I can't help it.

37:53.939 --> 37:55.572
This is the part I love.

38:05.216 --> 38:07.617
You always were
good with design.

38:07.652 --> 38:09.452
You're gonna be
an incredible event planner.

38:10.589 --> 38:14.023
So far, as an event planner,
I make a really good accountant.

38:14.059 --> 38:15.458
I mean, I've done it,

38:15.493 --> 38:17.271
I've done the budgets,
and the research,

38:17.295 --> 38:19.128
and the scheduling,
and the charts.

38:19.164 --> 38:20.697
As long as everybody's okay

38:20.732 --> 38:22.699
having the party
in an undecorated ballroom,

38:22.734 --> 38:24.200
it's gonna be awesome.

38:24.235 --> 38:26.769
Sounds like you need a vacation.

38:26.805 --> 38:28.316
I should've booked Christmas
in Honduras, like you.

38:28.340 --> 38:30.873
Warm, sandy beaches,

38:30.909 --> 38:32.709
drinks with
tiny, little umbrellas in them.

38:38.350 --> 38:39.482
Speaking of Honduras,

38:39.517 --> 38:41.050
I...

38:41.086 --> 38:42.819
I've been meaning to...

38:42.854 --> 38:44.854
Ben? Can I get
some water, please?

38:44.889 --> 38:46.556
Yeah, I'll be right there, Lily.

39:00.572 --> 39:02.071
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:02.107 --> 39:04.540
I hid the dollhouse
in the back of Ford's truck.

39:04.576 --> 39:05.853
Great, that's really smart.

39:05.877 --> 39:07.243
- She's asleep.
- Yeah?

39:07.278 --> 39:08.344
I'm gonna go to bed.

39:08.380 --> 39:09.380
Yeah, me too.

39:09.414 --> 39:11.848
Okay. Goodnight.

39:11.883 --> 39:13.883
Goodnight.

39:49.621 --> 39:51.788
Lily...
Breakfast is ready.

39:51.823 --> 39:54.590
I'll be down in a minute!

39:54.626 --> 39:57.727
Hey, so, Ford's surgery
is at noon today,

39:57.762 --> 39:58.806
and I just want
to keep her occupied

39:58.830 --> 39:59.762
until we know it went well.

39:59.798 --> 40:00.596
Good idea.

40:00.632 --> 40:01.931
Morning.

40:01.966 --> 40:03.132
Morning!

40:03.168 --> 40:07.103
This looks good!
You made Christmas bells.

40:07.138 --> 40:09.906
They're stethoscopes.

40:11.342 --> 40:12.909
If you squint your eyes,

40:12.944 --> 40:15.178
they kind of look
like stethoscopes.

40:15.213 --> 40:16.879
Thank you... Lily.

40:19.684 --> 40:20.917
Hey, Lily?

40:25.290 --> 40:27.490
What do you say...
We do that today?

40:27.525 --> 40:29.158
Main street.

40:29.194 --> 40:30.526
Main street?

40:30.562 --> 40:32.795
Looking at
all the pretty lights.

40:32.831 --> 40:35.865
Yeah, I haven't done that
since I was a kid.

40:35.900 --> 40:36.866
Well, you know what?

40:36.901 --> 40:37.867
I've got a lot of work to do
at the Inn today,

40:37.902 --> 40:40.103
but I could meet up
with you guys afterwards,

40:40.138 --> 40:41.204
maybe around 1:00?

40:41.239 --> 40:42.338
It's a date.

40:43.641 --> 40:46.275
I mean, you know,
for all of us.

40:51.683 --> 40:54.003
These are the best stethoscope
pancakes I've ever had.

41:04.095 --> 41:05.461
Jake.

41:05.497 --> 41:06.497
How are you?

41:10.602 --> 41:13.202
But you'll be here
for Christmas, right?

41:15.740 --> 41:17.840
Yeah, it's fine.

41:17.876 --> 41:19.809
I love you, too.

41:20.712 --> 41:21.677
What's wrong?

41:21.713 --> 41:23.980
Jake's just
getting sent to Albany.

41:24.015 --> 41:26.883
But he is sure he will be home
in a few days.

41:26.918 --> 41:29.118
Of course he will.

41:31.756 --> 41:33.156
How are you?

41:33.191 --> 41:35.024
I'm great.

41:35.059 --> 41:36.392
Great, great.

41:36.427 --> 41:37.960
That is a lot of "greats".

41:39.097 --> 41:40.163
Can I show you something?

41:40.198 --> 41:41.198
Sure.

41:49.874 --> 41:51.207
Peyton!

41:51.242 --> 41:52.341
I know.

41:52.377 --> 41:54.555
I'm having a lot of trouble
coming up with the theme.

41:54.579 --> 41:57.046
Yeah, but Peyton,
the party is in four days.

41:57.081 --> 41:59.382
Yeah, I know,
but I want it to be special.

41:59.417 --> 42:02.585
Okay, well...

42:02.620 --> 42:06.255
If not, we will just tell people
it's a minimalist party.

42:08.793 --> 42:10.760
Why is it so hard?

42:10.795 --> 42:12.628
Gosh, maybe I should
be an accountant.

42:12.664 --> 42:14.430
This shouldn't be so difficult.

42:14.465 --> 42:16.465
Well, of course, it's difficult.

42:16.501 --> 42:17.912
You're putting yourself
out there,

42:17.936 --> 42:19.235
and it's scary,

42:19.270 --> 42:20.369
but I know you can do it.

42:20.405 --> 42:21.370
You do?

42:21.406 --> 42:23.539
Yes, you got this.

42:23.575 --> 42:25.208
And if not,

42:25.243 --> 42:27.443
we will just put up
last year's decorations

42:27.478 --> 42:28.878
in a whole new way,

42:28.913 --> 42:30.057
and no one will know better.

42:30.081 --> 42:32.548
But... I will.

42:32.584 --> 42:33.916
It'll be great.

43:01.145 --> 43:02.511
Right?

43:06.985 --> 43:08.784
Look at that!

43:08.820 --> 43:10.620
What do you think?

43:10.655 --> 43:13.789
Is Santa feeding him
reindeer food, Lily?

43:13.825 --> 43:15.358
No. No glitter.

43:15.393 --> 43:17.260
Kind of reminds me
of our reindeer.

43:18.796 --> 43:19.829
You have a reindeer?

43:19.864 --> 43:20.963
No, I was kidding.

43:20.999 --> 43:21.931
Hey, I have a question.

43:21.966 --> 43:24.166
If you could decorate
the window display,

43:24.202 --> 43:25.962
however you wanted,
what would you do?

43:26.771 --> 43:32.041
A big snow globe,
with snow falling down.

43:32.076 --> 43:33.442
I love that.

43:33.478 --> 43:35.044
And something special.

43:35.079 --> 43:36.479
A family,

43:36.514 --> 43:38.281
a pet... Miranda!

43:38.316 --> 43:39.882
I love it.

43:39.918 --> 43:41.784
I'm gonna go check out
the craft store.

43:44.422 --> 43:46.689
It's the hospital.

43:47.825 --> 43:48.825
Mark. Hi.

43:51.062 --> 43:53.796
Thank you for letting us know.

43:53.831 --> 43:55.831
Ford sailed through the surgery.

43:55.867 --> 43:57.233
That's great.

43:57.268 --> 43:58.634
Should we bring Lily by?

43:58.670 --> 43:59.502
Yeah, in a little bit.

43:59.537 --> 44:00.681
I think he needs
some time to recuperate.

44:00.705 --> 44:02.104
That's great.

44:12.517 --> 44:15.384
This is where we make
our homemade presents.

44:15.420 --> 44:19.021
Homemade presents are the best.
Can we do this?

44:20.425 --> 44:21.891
- Sure.
- Sure.

44:24.128 --> 44:27.396
Your dad's
gonna love that, Lily.

44:27.432 --> 44:28.698
I think so, too.

44:28.733 --> 44:30.032
Who's that for?

44:30.068 --> 44:31.334
This is for my sister.

44:31.369 --> 44:33.202
It's a cookie platter.

44:34.105 --> 44:36.072
And what do you got?

44:36.107 --> 44:38.274
Is that a reindeer mug?

44:38.309 --> 44:39.408
As a matter of fact, it is.

44:39.444 --> 44:40.876
Who's that for?

44:40.912 --> 44:42.611
Me, I guess.

44:42.647 --> 44:44.513
You should give it to your dad.

44:45.917 --> 44:47.516
Yeah.

44:50.221 --> 44:52.888
Lily, I love this bracelet.

44:52.924 --> 44:55.424
Mom gave it to me.

44:55.460 --> 44:58.861
She says snowflakes
are like kisses from heaven.

45:03.267 --> 45:06.736
It's snowing!

45:21.152 --> 45:23.052
What a lovely family.

45:26.024 --> 45:27.890
Pretty!

45:27.925 --> 45:29.358
That is gorgeous.

45:30.361 --> 45:31.472
You should get it for the party.

45:31.496 --> 45:35.798
Well, I still do have
"get dress" on my to-do list.

45:35.833 --> 45:37.900
What party?

45:37.935 --> 45:41.670
Did your dad ever tell you
about the big snowstorm

45:41.706 --> 45:42.786
they had when he was a kid?

45:44.008 --> 45:45.619
Okay, 25 years ago,
Christmas Eve,

45:45.643 --> 45:48.310
all the electricity goes out
in Birch Creek,

45:48.346 --> 45:50.613
but the Inn had a generator,

45:50.648 --> 45:52.014
so my mom and dad got an idea.

45:52.050 --> 45:53.849
Before I knew it,
the entire town

45:53.885 --> 45:55.951
was in our ballroom,

45:55.987 --> 45:58.621
and my folks know how to party,
so they just thought,

45:58.656 --> 46:00.300
"why not invite
everyone every year?"

46:00.324 --> 46:01.690
So we do.

46:01.726 --> 46:04.026
Are you going to the party?

46:04.062 --> 46:06.929
I'm not,
I'm going be in Honduras.

46:06.964 --> 46:08.464
Yeah, he's going on vacation.

46:11.369 --> 46:14.170
Actually, Peyton,
I should tell you something.

46:14.205 --> 46:15.304
What is it?

46:15.339 --> 46:17.440
It's not a vacation.

46:17.475 --> 46:19.608
It's a job interview.

46:19.644 --> 46:22.645
What's the job?

46:22.680 --> 46:24.947
You've heard of
Doctor's Care International?

46:24.982 --> 46:26.115
Yeah.

46:26.150 --> 46:30.019
So it's a three-year contract
in their Honduras clinic.

46:30.054 --> 46:34.023
My dad spent most of his career
doing this sort of thing.

46:34.058 --> 46:35.925
It's my turn.

46:37.095 --> 46:39.073
Why did you want me to think
you were going on vacation?

46:39.097 --> 46:41.297
I'm sorry.

46:41.332 --> 46:44.366
I didn't want to say anything
until I knew I had the job.

46:45.570 --> 46:49.171
Well, thanks for telling me.

46:50.374 --> 46:51.585
Sounds like a great opportunity.

46:51.609 --> 46:54.477
I bet you'll get it, Ben.

46:54.512 --> 46:55.512
Yeah.

46:56.714 --> 46:58.681
Ben, come look at this.

47:21.272 --> 47:23.739
It's complicated.

47:23.774 --> 47:25.174
It sounds complicated.

47:25.209 --> 47:26.408
What did you say?

47:26.444 --> 47:27.543
What was I supposed to say?

47:27.578 --> 47:28.377
I mean, it's a noble job,

47:28.412 --> 47:30.346
and he's a noble man
for doing it.

47:30.381 --> 47:31.947
But he's bad boyfriend material.

47:31.983 --> 47:33.716
Geographically speaking.

47:33.751 --> 47:34.984
I don't want a boyfriend.

47:35.953 --> 47:37.953
Then it's not a problem
that Ben's leaving.

47:37.989 --> 47:40.122
Exactly. This is a good thing.

47:40.158 --> 47:42.458
Ben and I figured out
how to be friends,

47:42.493 --> 47:44.204
and we're never gonna be
anything else,

47:44.228 --> 47:45.772
and it doesn't mean
that we can't

47:45.796 --> 47:47.096
have a good time with Lily.

47:47.131 --> 47:48.731
Yeah, that makes sense.

47:48.766 --> 47:51.400
Yeah. All I know is,

47:51.435 --> 47:53.402
I want to throw
the best holiday party

47:53.437 --> 47:55.571
this Inn has ever seen.

47:55.606 --> 47:57.940
I also know that,
speaking of boyfriend material,

47:57.975 --> 47:59.553
this guy right here
might be my perfect match.

47:59.577 --> 48:00.609
Look at this...

48:00.645 --> 48:01.777
Crusty on the outside,

48:01.812 --> 48:03.612
super-sweet on the inside.

48:03.648 --> 48:05.147
Hello, sir!

48:05.183 --> 48:06.482
You're not going anywhere.

48:06.517 --> 48:09.585
And you and I have no history
whatsoever.

48:09.620 --> 48:10.886
I think I'm in love.

48:10.922 --> 48:11.954
What's your name?

48:11.989 --> 48:13.455
Pecan pie.

48:13.491 --> 48:16.392
Hello, pecan pie.
My name's Peyton.

48:16.427 --> 48:18.994
I'm gonna call you "Steve"
as a nickname.

48:19.030 --> 48:20.807
Yeah, I think you and Steve
are moving a little too fast.

48:20.831 --> 48:22.798
Fine! Take Steve!

48:23.834 --> 48:24.633
You know what?

48:24.669 --> 48:26.269
I gotta call
the chair rental people.

48:26.304 --> 48:27.236
And confirm.

48:27.271 --> 48:29.471
No, they were
delivered last night.

48:29.507 --> 48:30.851
I put them in the storage room.

48:30.875 --> 48:32.619
And you can cross
shrimp off your list,

48:32.643 --> 48:35.411
because I confirmed with
the supplier this morning.

48:35.446 --> 48:37.166
Is there anything else you need?

48:38.349 --> 48:40.916
I mean, I could use
some cookie supplies.

48:40.952 --> 48:42.351
Why?

48:42.386 --> 48:44.131
I'm just baking cookies
with Lily this afternoon

48:44.155 --> 48:45.155
for her teachers.

48:45.189 --> 48:47.289
What else do you need?

48:47.325 --> 48:49.858
Everything.

48:53.064 --> 48:54.129
Thanks.

48:54.165 --> 48:55.130
Hey, Miles.

48:55.166 --> 48:56.365
Hey, Peyton.

48:56.400 --> 48:58.679
We're here taking some pictures
for the Christmas article.

48:58.703 --> 49:00.047
- Great.
- And guess what?

49:00.071 --> 49:01.170
What?

49:01.205 --> 49:02.616
You've got the whole front page.

49:02.640 --> 49:03.984
It's gonna be
all about your party.

49:04.008 --> 49:04.940
Think of the headline...

49:04.976 --> 49:07.843
"Anniversary celebration
at the Canaday Inn...

49:07.878 --> 49:10.479
Most beautiful party
in 25 years".

49:10.514 --> 49:12.226
- It's a great hook, right?
- Yeah, I guess so.

49:12.250 --> 49:13.882
My editor loved it.

49:13.918 --> 49:14.850
Hey, do you have some time?

49:14.885 --> 49:17.353
For what?

49:17.388 --> 49:18.254
I'd like to interview you.

49:18.289 --> 49:20.489
I bet I can even guess
your party theme.

49:20.524 --> 49:22.958
That would be a trick.

49:22.994 --> 49:25.728
I wish I could, I'm so busy.

49:25.763 --> 49:28.464
I've got lists
up to, like, here.

49:28.499 --> 49:29.365
But...

49:29.400 --> 49:31.044
- Maybe another time?
- Yeah, sure thing.

49:31.068 --> 49:32.628
- Great. Thanks. Bye!
- Bye.

49:34.605 --> 49:36.138
So, Christmas socks, huh?

49:36.173 --> 49:37.473
Yeah.

49:37.508 --> 49:38.752
I get them for my dad
every year.

49:38.776 --> 49:40.809
I saw your picture
on the fridge.

49:40.845 --> 49:42.356
I thought it was
a Christmas stocking.

49:42.380 --> 49:44.647
Nope! Socks.

49:46.083 --> 49:48.083
Shall we go in?

49:48.119 --> 49:49.151
Absolutely.

49:51.188 --> 49:52.888
Do you like these?

49:52.923 --> 49:55.190
Or... these?

49:55.226 --> 49:56.759
Mm-Kay...

49:56.794 --> 49:59.762
Or... these?

50:02.300 --> 50:03.432
I kind of like all of them.

50:03.467 --> 50:05.868
Which ones do you think
your dad would like the best?

50:05.903 --> 50:09.271
These! Because he loves cars
and trees.

50:09.307 --> 50:10.873
I think we have a winner.

50:10.908 --> 50:11.908
Ding-ding-ding!

50:28.592 --> 50:31.093
I love that!

50:31.128 --> 50:32.861
Are those gingerbread doctors?

50:32.897 --> 50:34.196
Yes, they are.

50:34.231 --> 50:37.199
Smorgas-board-certified.

50:37.234 --> 50:40.536
Right. Yeah. He's a vet who
fixes broken animal crackers.

50:41.605 --> 50:43.605
This is so fun!

50:43.641 --> 50:45.619
I can't remember the last time
I made Christmas cookies.

50:45.643 --> 50:46.608
Yeah, me either.

50:46.644 --> 50:49.044
Because I have never
made Christmas cookies.

50:49.080 --> 50:50.479
That's sad.

50:50.514 --> 50:52.426
Well, I'm making up for it
now, aren't I?

50:52.450 --> 50:53.450
All right, well,

50:53.484 --> 50:56.251
put your gingerbread
medicine men on this plate

50:56.287 --> 50:58.320
and then we'll get ready to go.

50:58.356 --> 51:00.356
This is where Mr. Pascal lives.

51:08.265 --> 51:09.465
Hola, Mr. Pascal!

51:09.500 --> 51:10.599
We made you some cookies.

51:10.634 --> 51:12.167
Gracias.

51:12.203 --> 51:14.670
Lily, do you remember
the word for "cookies"?

51:14.705 --> 51:15.738
Galletas.

51:15.773 --> 51:17.272
Excelente.

51:17.308 --> 51:20.476
And these are
"galletas de jengibre..."

51:20.511 --> 51:21.643
Gingerbread cookies.

51:21.679 --> 51:22.778
My favorite.

51:22.813 --> 51:23.846
Feliz navidad.

51:23.881 --> 51:25.147
Thank you.
Feliz navidad.

51:25.182 --> 51:26.882
- Adios.
- Adios!

51:28.085 --> 51:31.553
Every time I smell gingerbread,
it's like I'm a kid again.

51:32.556 --> 51:35.591
You know what reminds me
of being a kid again?

51:35.626 --> 51:36.626
What?

51:40.364 --> 51:41.964
You are... hold this, Lily.

51:41.999 --> 51:42.999
What? No, no, no.

51:43.033 --> 51:44.211
- Yeah.
- No.

51:44.235 --> 51:45.946
- That's not how it works.
- Oh, yeah.

51:45.970 --> 51:47.703
No. No, no, no, no.
No! No!

51:50.808 --> 51:53.075
That's it.

51:54.578 --> 51:56.678
Merry Christmas, Mrs. Conway!

51:56.714 --> 51:58.514
Thank you, Lily.

51:58.549 --> 52:00.115
Peyton Canaday?

52:01.318 --> 52:02.885
Ben Tyler?

52:02.920 --> 52:04.798
You two are still getting
into trouble, I see.

52:06.257 --> 52:07.556
Yes, ma'am.

52:07.591 --> 52:09.391
These are beautiful.

52:09.427 --> 52:10.859
We all decorated one of those.

52:10.895 --> 52:13.061
Lily...

52:13.097 --> 52:15.164
I bet this bright one is yours.

52:16.500 --> 52:19.034
And Peyton, I remember you
from my art class.

52:19.069 --> 52:20.536
This one is yours.

52:20.571 --> 52:22.404
You were always a good artist.

52:22.440 --> 52:23.539
I loved your class.

52:24.608 --> 52:26.308
This one's yours, Ben.

52:26.343 --> 52:28.076
Yes.

52:28.112 --> 52:30.712
You've gotten much better
than when you were in my class.

52:30.748 --> 52:33.015
Thank you, Mrs. Conway.

52:35.453 --> 52:38.320
Extra marshmallows
for Lily and Dr. Ben.

52:38.355 --> 52:40.155
Thank you.

52:40.191 --> 52:41.868
And a dash of cinnamon
for Peyton.

52:41.892 --> 52:43.392
Thanks.

52:43.427 --> 52:44.993
I thought you were on vacation.

52:45.029 --> 52:47.429
I'm flying out on the 25th now.

52:47.465 --> 52:49.298
Well, have a good time.

52:50.534 --> 52:53.569
Christmas
is not a fun day to travel.

52:53.604 --> 52:55.370
Well, I've done it before.

52:55.406 --> 52:57.739
You know, it's funny,
for the first time in my life,

52:57.775 --> 52:59.775
I'm actually enjoying
the Christmas holidays.

52:59.810 --> 53:01.910
And wouldn't you know it,
I have to leave.

53:01.946 --> 53:04.746
You know, if you're in town
for Christmas Eve...

53:05.783 --> 53:08.250
...I can come to the party.

53:08.285 --> 53:09.685
25 years...

53:09.720 --> 53:10.919
That's a lot of parties.

53:10.955 --> 53:12.554
Which one was your favorite?

53:12.590 --> 53:14.623
Hard to say.

53:14.658 --> 53:16.425
You know what?
Probably the first one.

53:16.460 --> 53:18.794
There was so much snow,
it was like...

53:18.829 --> 53:20.729
A winter wonderland.

53:20.764 --> 53:22.965
I was about your age.
I wish you could have seen it.

53:23.000 --> 53:24.266
Me too.

53:25.736 --> 53:27.569
Wait a second.

53:27.605 --> 53:29.037
That's it.

53:29.073 --> 53:30.405
What?

53:30.441 --> 53:32.474
I see it so clearly...

53:32.510 --> 53:34.042
For the first time.

53:34.078 --> 53:35.210
What is it?

53:35.246 --> 53:38.080
The theme!
For the party.

53:40.484 --> 53:42.217
I gotta go.

53:42.253 --> 53:44.753
Where are you going?

53:44.788 --> 53:46.588
You'll see!

53:54.164 --> 53:55.731
Hey! How's it going?

53:55.766 --> 53:56.932
I think I got it!

54:49.587 --> 54:50.552
Hey, Ben.

54:50.588 --> 54:51.887
I'm here, too!

54:51.922 --> 54:53.255
How's it going?

54:53.290 --> 54:55.257
Really, really well.
How are you?

54:55.292 --> 54:56.292
Couldn't be better.

54:56.327 --> 54:58.860
We were just starting
to think about dinner,

54:58.896 --> 55:01.196
and wondering if
you were gonna be home soon?

55:01.231 --> 55:02.698
<i>I wish I could,</i>

55:02.733 --> 55:04.466
but I can't,
I've got to work late.

55:04.501 --> 55:06.479
And you know what? I'm just
gonna sleep at my place tonight,

55:06.503 --> 55:07.981
so I don't wake you up
when I come home.

55:08.005 --> 55:09.938
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

55:09.974 --> 55:11.039
I love you.

55:11.075 --> 55:12.874
<i>We love you too! Bye!</i>

55:13.911 --> 55:15.711
Bye.

55:19.516 --> 55:20.882
Okay.

55:20.918 --> 55:22.117
Chores are done.

55:22.152 --> 55:25.454
I was looking at your drawings
on the fridge this morning.

55:25.489 --> 55:26.833
Want to do
some Christmas crafts?

55:26.857 --> 55:28.156
Can we go see Peyton?

55:28.192 --> 55:30.792
She's...
She's awfully busy.

55:32.262 --> 55:33.795
What's that, Miranda?

55:33.831 --> 55:36.098
Ben and I should go see Peyton?

55:37.635 --> 55:39.601
You're a quick learner, kiddo.

55:47.978 --> 55:49.478
Don't come in!

55:49.513 --> 55:51.947
The elves are working!

55:51.982 --> 55:52.948
Peyton?

55:52.983 --> 55:54.116
It's us.

55:54.151 --> 55:56.251
Hi!

55:56.286 --> 55:57.853
We brought supplies.

55:57.888 --> 55:59.588
You guys are the best.

55:59.623 --> 56:00.989
Thank you.

56:02.960 --> 56:03.792
Here.

56:03.827 --> 56:06.261
Thanks. Here.

56:07.865 --> 56:10.098
Looks like
you're making some progress.

56:10.134 --> 56:11.233
Yeah, well, I hope so.

56:11.268 --> 56:13.669
In a day and a half,
the whole town's gonna be here.

56:13.704 --> 56:15.315
Is there anything
we can do to help?

56:15.339 --> 56:16.705
Yeah! Can we help?

56:59.016 --> 57:00.682
It's looking good.

57:00.718 --> 57:02.384
Yep. We're getting there.

57:02.419 --> 57:05.220
Are you gonna put presents
under all the trees?

57:05.255 --> 57:07.422
No, those are decorations.

57:07.458 --> 57:09.524
You've got to have presents!

57:14.565 --> 57:16.231
Hey. Can I talk to you guys?

57:16.266 --> 57:17.499
Sure, honey. What's up?

57:17.534 --> 57:19.601
Lily just gave me a great idea,

57:19.636 --> 57:21.281
but it's gonna require
a lot of extra work.

57:21.305 --> 57:23.505
I think it's finally time
I asked for your help.

57:23.540 --> 57:26.742
So I want to make
the fire department's toy drive

57:26.777 --> 57:28.276
a part of our holiday party.

57:28.312 --> 57:29.556
I already talked
to the fire chief.

57:29.580 --> 57:30.612
You did?

57:30.647 --> 57:32.047
If we work together,

57:32.082 --> 57:34.449
I think we can make this
a new holiday tradition.

57:34.485 --> 57:35.751
I love that idea.

57:35.786 --> 57:37.519
We're on it.

57:37.554 --> 57:40.122
We'll contact everyone
who's coming to the party.

57:40.157 --> 57:41.468
The fire department
needs presents,

57:41.492 --> 57:42.858
we'll get them presents.

57:42.893 --> 57:44.760
You guys are amazing.

57:44.795 --> 57:46.728
I have one more request.

57:47.698 --> 57:49.109
I want to go and get Lily
a Christmas present,

57:49.133 --> 57:50.799
and I think Ben does, too.

57:50.834 --> 57:53.201
Is there any way
you would babysit?

57:54.338 --> 57:56.538
We can have a tea party!

57:56.573 --> 57:58.640
I think that's gonna be
just fine, Peyton.

57:58.675 --> 58:00.575
Thank you.

58:08.185 --> 58:10.285
Wait, hold on,
let's meet back right here,

58:10.320 --> 58:11.320
in half an hour.

58:11.355 --> 58:12.487
We're not shopping together?

58:12.523 --> 58:15.590
No! You need to pick out
something that's just from you.

58:16.994 --> 58:19.261
You think
Lily would like a necktie?

58:19.296 --> 58:20.428
- No.
- No?

58:20.464 --> 58:21.630
Half an hour.

58:21.665 --> 58:22.864
- Okay.
- Okay.

58:23.867 --> 58:26.134
You know what,
there's this thing I wanna...

58:26.170 --> 58:27.850
Yeah, I'm just gonna
go this way.

58:34.978 --> 58:35.944
- Hi.
- Hi.

58:35.979 --> 58:37.245
I ordered for us.

58:37.281 --> 58:38.281
Thank you.

58:38.315 --> 58:40.293
With a dash of cinnamon,
just the way you like it.

58:40.317 --> 58:41.797
- What'd you get?
- Neckties.

58:43.353 --> 58:44.786
Art supplies.

58:44.822 --> 58:46.988
She's gonna love this, Ben.

58:47.024 --> 58:48.456
What did you get?

58:52.329 --> 58:53.361
Ribbon...

58:53.397 --> 58:54.963
And a ball?

58:54.998 --> 58:56.965
Just a little Christmas magic.

58:57.000 --> 58:57.933
Some assembly required.

58:57.968 --> 58:59.134
What is it?

58:59.169 --> 59:01.503
It's a surprise for Lily.

59:01.538 --> 59:03.338
You've heard of surprises,
right?

59:06.310 --> 59:07.542
To surprises.

59:07.578 --> 59:10.111
And to a wonderful party.

59:10.147 --> 59:13.615
You believed in me
when no one else did.

59:13.650 --> 59:15.483
I know you, Peyton.

59:15.519 --> 59:16.985
I knew you could do it.

59:17.020 --> 59:18.353
Thank you, Ben.

59:37.341 --> 59:38.707
There you go...

59:38.742 --> 59:40.520
Just like you like it,
nothing touching.

59:40.544 --> 59:41.643
Thank you.

59:41.678 --> 59:43.645
Thank you both so much

59:43.680 --> 59:44.891
for your help
with the ballroom this week.

59:44.915 --> 59:45.847
It was fun.

59:45.883 --> 59:47.415
You know,

59:47.451 --> 59:49.651
I wasn't entirely sure
a couple of days ago,

59:49.686 --> 59:51.731
but now I feel like it's gonna
be a really wonderful party.

59:51.755 --> 59:54.322
So would you say that
everything on your list is done?

59:54.358 --> 59:56.191
Yeah, I mean,

59:56.226 --> 59:58.066
I've got a couple of odds
and ends left, but...

01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:02.431
What?

01:00:02.466 --> 01:00:04.366
What's this?

01:00:04.401 --> 01:00:05.600
It's a surprise.

01:00:05.636 --> 01:00:07.236
You've heard of
surprises, right?

01:00:07.971 --> 01:00:08.870
What?

01:00:08.906 --> 01:00:10.038
Now. Now.

01:00:10.073 --> 01:00:11.706
Now?

01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:15.710
We thought of you
when we saw this.

01:00:17.214 --> 01:00:18.980
What is this?

01:00:24.621 --> 01:00:27.389
It's the dress from the store!

01:00:27.424 --> 01:00:29.024
Is it for the party?

01:00:29.059 --> 01:00:32.427
I love it!
You guys, thank you so much.

01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:36.131
I don't know what I would do
without you two.

01:00:36.166 --> 01:00:38.233
It was our pleasure.

01:00:38.268 --> 01:00:39.434
Truly.

01:00:40.604 --> 01:00:41.604
I'll get it!

01:00:47.411 --> 01:00:49.244
Hello?

01:00:49.279 --> 01:00:50.512
Daddy!

01:00:53.517 --> 01:00:55.450
He's coming home
tomorrow morning!

01:01:04.428 --> 01:01:05.660
She was asleep

01:01:05.696 --> 01:01:07.662
before Humphrey
even delivered the gifts.

01:01:08.999 --> 01:01:11.299
Thank you.

01:01:11.335 --> 01:01:13.568
What'd you find?

01:01:13.603 --> 01:01:14.936
I found us.

01:01:29.386 --> 01:01:30.919
Glitter.

01:01:38.662 --> 01:01:40.428
I've never seen any of these.

01:01:40.464 --> 01:01:42.564
Yeah. Look at us.

01:01:44.334 --> 01:01:47.602
You know, I've thought a lot
about that night over the years.

01:01:47.637 --> 01:01:49.397
Didn't really know
how to bring it up.

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:53.041
Well, what...
What's there to talk about?

01:01:53.076 --> 01:01:54.809
I told you
I had feelings for you,

01:01:54.845 --> 01:01:55.989
and you didn't feel the same.

01:01:56.013 --> 01:01:57.345
That's not exactly true.

01:02:00.183 --> 01:02:02.617
My life was complicated.

01:02:02.652 --> 01:02:04.364
I had just graduated
from med school.

01:02:04.388 --> 01:02:06.032
I was leaving
for my surgical residency

01:02:06.056 --> 01:02:07.222
in California.

01:02:07.257 --> 01:02:09.657
But you didn't call,
you didn't write.

01:02:09.693 --> 01:02:12.293
I found out from Freddy
that you were back in town.

01:02:12.329 --> 01:02:14.863
I guess I didn't want
to be unfair to you.

01:02:16.433 --> 01:02:18.733
I figured I must have hurt you.

01:02:18.769 --> 01:02:21.369
I guess I didn't want
to hurt you anymore.

01:02:21.405 --> 01:02:22.871
And then...

01:02:22.906 --> 01:02:24.906
You know, when I saw you
the other day...

01:02:26.443 --> 01:02:28.309
I thought you'd forgotten
about it.

01:02:29.946 --> 01:02:31.913
I'm sorry.

01:02:31.948 --> 01:02:35.016
I really, genuinely am.

01:02:35.052 --> 01:02:37.052
Thank you for saying that.

01:02:37.087 --> 01:02:39.020
It's okay.

01:02:39.056 --> 01:02:40.722
It's in the past.

01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:42.190
But do me a favor.

01:02:42.225 --> 01:02:43.725
When you go to Honduras,

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:45.660
keep in touch.

01:02:45.695 --> 01:02:47.662
I mean, let me know
how you're doing, okay?

01:02:48.698 --> 01:02:49.698
Promise.

01:03:01.611 --> 01:03:03.745
Well, what do you
think, Miranda?

01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:06.081
You're an intelligent horse.

01:03:06.116 --> 01:03:07.382
She's here

01:03:07.417 --> 01:03:10.118
and I'm moving
halfway around the world.

01:03:10.153 --> 01:03:11.519
Is there anything we can do?

01:03:13.356 --> 01:03:16.925
Yeah, I can't think
of anything either.

01:03:26.503 --> 01:03:28.303
There they are!

01:03:30.674 --> 01:03:31.806
- Hi!
- Daddy!

01:03:31.842 --> 01:03:33.274
I'm so excited you're home.

01:03:33.310 --> 01:03:34.943
- Yeah, me too.
- Hey, folks.

01:03:34.978 --> 01:03:36.444
Hey. Welcome home.

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:37.812
Thank you.

01:03:37.848 --> 01:03:38.780
Hey, buddy.

01:03:38.815 --> 01:03:40.014
Hey, man.

01:03:40.050 --> 01:03:42.083
I need to decorate those.

01:03:42.119 --> 01:03:44.030
You do need to decorate these.
That's a great idea.

01:03:44.054 --> 01:03:44.886
You got everything you need?

01:03:44.921 --> 01:03:46.532
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
We're gonna be good.

01:03:46.556 --> 01:03:48.367
The neighbors already offered
to bring us over

01:03:48.391 --> 01:03:49.836
Christmas dinner,
so that'll be fun.

01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:52.927
You two have been a godsend.

01:03:52.963 --> 01:03:55.130
I'm never gonna forget
what you did for us.

01:03:55.165 --> 01:03:56.297
Appreciate it.

01:03:56.333 --> 01:03:59.400
Lily, give me a hug.

01:04:01.505 --> 01:04:03.138
I had the best time with you.

01:04:03.173 --> 01:04:07.542
Thank you for giving me
such a magical Christmas.

01:04:07.577 --> 01:04:09.711
I'm gonna miss you, kiddo.

01:04:09.746 --> 01:04:11.246
I'll be right back.

01:04:12.382 --> 01:04:13.781
Where's she going?

01:04:17.721 --> 01:04:19.487
I drew this for you.

01:04:19.523 --> 01:04:21.556
I love it!

01:04:21.591 --> 01:04:24.492
I'm gonna put this in a frame.
Thank you!

01:04:24.528 --> 01:04:27.162
I'll drop off your present
on Christmas day.

01:04:27.197 --> 01:04:29.664
And this is for you.

01:04:29.699 --> 01:04:30.665
Are you kiddin' me?

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:32.400
It's my favorite.

01:04:32.435 --> 01:04:34.035
"Humphrey
the swimming reindeer".

01:04:34.070 --> 01:04:35.136
Thank you.

01:04:35.172 --> 01:04:37.405
All right, let's get you inside.

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:38.484
- All right.
- Okay, let's go.

01:04:38.508 --> 01:04:39.574
Doctor's orders.

01:04:39.609 --> 01:04:40.820
Gotta go.
See you, guys.

01:04:40.844 --> 01:04:42.977
- All right.
- Bye.

01:04:51.621 --> 01:04:53.054
Right back where we started.

01:04:53.089 --> 01:04:54.822
With you giving me a ride.

01:04:56.092 --> 01:04:58.259
Seems like such a long time ago.

01:04:58.295 --> 01:04:59.127
It's only been a couple of days.

01:04:59.162 --> 01:05:01.963
Well, a couple of days
and ten years.

01:05:05.135 --> 01:05:08.369
Why are we acting like
this is goodbye?

01:05:08.405 --> 01:05:09.549
I'll see you tomorrow
at the party.

01:05:09.573 --> 01:05:12.040
Yeah. Yeah.

01:05:12.075 --> 01:05:13.308
Thank you for the ride.

01:05:37.334 --> 01:05:38.933
- Luis!
- Hey, Peyton.

01:05:38.969 --> 01:05:39.901
Hi.

01:05:39.936 --> 01:05:42.237
Just dropping off a toy
for the toy drive.

01:05:42.272 --> 01:05:44.105
Thank you.

01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:45.373
We'll see you at the party.

01:05:45.408 --> 01:05:46.641
All right, see you soon!

01:05:48.245 --> 01:05:50.211
People have been
coming by all morning.

01:05:50.247 --> 01:05:51.958
I'll make sure
I call the fire department.

01:05:51.982 --> 01:05:52.982
It's already done.

01:05:53.016 --> 01:05:54.927
They're gonna send a crew over
after the party

01:05:54.951 --> 01:05:55.817
to pick up the toys,

01:05:55.852 --> 01:05:57.730
and they will deliver them
to the kids

01:05:57.754 --> 01:05:59.053
on Christmas morning.

01:05:59.089 --> 01:06:00.388
Thanks, you two.

01:06:11.835 --> 01:06:13.434
You're awful quiet.

01:06:14.938 --> 01:06:17.238
I just checked the forecast
in Albany.

01:06:17.274 --> 01:06:19.318
I'm worried about Jake getting
home in time for Christmas.

01:06:19.342 --> 01:06:21.442
Is their airport still open?

01:06:21.478 --> 01:06:23.011
So far.

01:06:23.046 --> 01:06:24.746
Fingers crossed.

01:06:25.849 --> 01:06:26.981
Let's change subjects.

01:06:27.017 --> 01:06:29.117
What is going on
with you and Dr. Ben?

01:06:29.152 --> 01:06:31.586
Forecast isn't so good
there, either.

01:06:31.621 --> 01:06:32.920
No, it's fine.

01:06:32.956 --> 01:06:34.800
It's just we're back
to being friends,

01:06:34.824 --> 01:06:36.090
and that's enough.

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:38.359
Sure.

01:06:38.395 --> 01:06:39.527
It is!

01:06:53.677 --> 01:06:56.144
We could have met
in the hospital cafeteria.

01:06:56.179 --> 01:06:58.446
Yeah. This is nicer.

01:06:58.481 --> 01:06:59.525
What time's
your Honduras flight?

01:06:59.549 --> 01:07:01.382
Christmas day at 6:00 p.m.

01:07:01.418 --> 01:07:03.151
My flight to Vermont
is at 7:00.

01:07:03.186 --> 01:07:04.218
We should carpool.

01:07:04.254 --> 01:07:05.687
Yeah.
Yeah, that'd be great.

01:07:06.923 --> 01:07:08.189
Let me ask you something.

01:07:09.826 --> 01:07:12.393
You traveled around
for work a lot,

01:07:12.429 --> 01:07:14.395
and it was important work,

01:07:14.431 --> 01:07:17.332
but did you ever miss
being at home?

01:07:17.367 --> 01:07:18.833
Well, of course, I did,

01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:21.135
but think of the difference
I made in people's lives.

01:07:21.171 --> 01:07:22.236
It's all worth it.

01:07:22.272 --> 01:07:24.339
You'll see.

01:07:25.909 --> 01:07:27.642
What's this about, son?

01:07:28.745 --> 01:07:30.144
It's nothing.

01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:31.524
What time
do you want to pick me up?

01:07:31.548 --> 01:07:33.514
- About 4:00.
- Okay.

01:07:39.389 --> 01:07:40.389
Come in!

01:07:42.859 --> 01:07:43.891
Hey.

01:07:43.927 --> 01:07:46.527
Hi. What's all that?

01:07:48.198 --> 01:07:49.842
Well, it's the big party
tomorrow,

01:07:49.866 --> 01:07:50.698
and I know how
you get distracted,

01:07:50.734 --> 01:07:52.667
and I want to make
that sure you eat.

01:07:52.702 --> 01:07:54.582
You want to make sure
a lot of people eat.

01:07:55.271 --> 01:07:57.672
Smells like bacon.
Have you been stress-cooking?

01:07:57.707 --> 01:08:01.209
I'm trying to cook through
all 200 million bacon recipes,

01:08:01.244 --> 01:08:04.112
and so far, I'm up to 34.

01:08:04.147 --> 01:08:05.813
You talked to Jake.

01:08:06.983 --> 01:08:09.384
Yeah. He got snowed in.
He won't be home for Christmas.

01:08:09.419 --> 01:08:10.351
Oh, no.

01:08:10.387 --> 01:08:12.353
I'm so sorry.

01:08:12.389 --> 01:08:14.233
I just wanted to wake up
on Christmas morning

01:08:14.257 --> 01:08:15.623
with my new husband there.

01:08:16.725 --> 01:08:18.593
Okay, I know it's not the same,

01:08:18.627 --> 01:08:19.594
but how about this...

01:08:19.629 --> 01:08:20.461
On Christmas morning,

01:08:20.497 --> 01:08:21.929
I'm gonna come over,

01:08:21.965 --> 01:08:23.075
and we're gonna go out
into the yard,

01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:24.631
and we're gonna make snow angels

01:08:24.667 --> 01:08:26.434
just like we did
when we were kids.

01:08:27.569 --> 01:08:28.536
I'd like that.

01:08:28.571 --> 01:08:30.604
Me too.

01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:32.240
I'm sorry.

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:33.941
It's okay.

01:09:14.451 --> 01:09:16.216
Everything looks great, honey.

01:09:16.252 --> 01:09:17.752
Yeah.

01:09:17.787 --> 01:09:19.720
Can't we stay
a little bit longer?

01:09:19.756 --> 01:09:21.421
Well, we have to get home

01:09:21.457 --> 01:09:23.224
and make reindeer food,
remember?

01:09:23.259 --> 01:09:24.392
Yeah, I forgot.

01:09:24.426 --> 01:09:26.359
It's a tradition.

01:09:31.434 --> 01:09:32.934
Hi.

01:09:32.969 --> 01:09:34.702
The fire chief says

01:09:34.737 --> 01:09:37.238
that this year's toy drive
is the most successful ever.

01:09:37.273 --> 01:09:40.107
And it's a brand-new
family tradition for us.

01:09:40.143 --> 01:09:42.410
- I love it.
- I love it, too.

01:09:42.444 --> 01:09:43.721
Okay, I'm gonna go get ready
for my speech.

01:09:43.746 --> 01:09:45.279
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:09:47.417 --> 01:09:49.649
- Hey, how's it going?
- Going like clockwork.

01:09:49.685 --> 01:09:50.763
Great, you'll let me know
if you need me.

01:09:50.787 --> 01:09:51.551
Yeah. Enjoy your party.

01:09:51.587 --> 01:09:52.620
Thank you.

01:09:56.993 --> 01:09:59.060
Hey, Lily.
How are you?

01:09:59.095 --> 01:10:00.661
- Good.
- You look beautiful.

01:10:00.697 --> 01:10:02.107
Hi, sweetie.
You look so lovely.

01:10:02.131 --> 01:10:03.264
Look at you.

01:10:03.299 --> 01:10:05.066
Man on crutches.
Watch your feet.

01:10:21.985 --> 01:10:24.252
Hello, everyone!

01:10:24.287 --> 01:10:26.020
Hi!

01:10:26.055 --> 01:10:27.622
Thank you for coming.

01:10:27.657 --> 01:10:32.460
Welcome to the annual
Canaday Inn Christmas party.

01:10:40.203 --> 01:10:41.869
For 25 years,

01:10:41.905 --> 01:10:44.805
my parents
have shared Christmas magic

01:10:44.841 --> 01:10:46.474
with all of us.

01:10:46.509 --> 01:10:49.310
And I think, over the years,

01:10:49.345 --> 01:10:52.179
I may have lost touch
with that magic a little bit.

01:10:52.215 --> 01:10:54.115
But, this Christmas,

01:10:54.150 --> 01:10:55.850
my friend...

01:10:55.885 --> 01:10:57.518
Lily Sherman...

01:10:57.554 --> 01:10:59.854
Helped me find it again.

01:10:59.889 --> 01:11:02.156
So, at that first party,

01:11:02.191 --> 01:11:06.827
there was a magical
Christmas wonderland outside,

01:11:06.863 --> 01:11:09.163
and so, tonight,

01:11:09.198 --> 01:11:12.133
we have tried to bring that back
to all of you.

01:11:12.168 --> 01:11:13.868
Lily...

01:11:13.903 --> 01:11:16.137
Can you please help me
with the doors?

01:11:52.875 --> 01:11:55.042
It looks beautiful.

01:11:55.078 --> 01:11:57.211
Hey! Look at the snowflakes.

01:11:57.246 --> 01:11:59.580
Snowflakes
are like kisses from heaven.

01:11:59.616 --> 01:12:03.184
Yeah, that's what
your mom always said.

01:12:18.434 --> 01:12:19.900
Mom and dad!

01:12:19.936 --> 01:12:21.535
Hi!

01:12:22.905 --> 01:12:24.405
What do you think?

01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:26.207
Sweetie, it is magical.

01:12:26.242 --> 01:12:27.242
I love it.

01:12:27.276 --> 01:12:28.943
I absolutely love it.

01:12:28.978 --> 01:12:30.544
We knew you could do it.

01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:32.613
Thanks, guys.

01:12:40.957 --> 01:12:42.089
What's up, sis?

01:12:42.125 --> 01:12:43.624
I'll see you later.

01:12:43.660 --> 01:12:45.826
So? What I'd miss?

01:12:45.862 --> 01:12:47.561
Mom and dad love the party.

01:12:47.597 --> 01:12:48.362
Of course, they do.

01:12:48.398 --> 01:12:49.930
And I wonder if there's any more

01:12:49.966 --> 01:12:52.299
of those tinny little
bacon appetizers I love?

01:12:52.335 --> 01:12:54.135
- Sure. Yeah. Why?
- Great.

01:12:54.170 --> 01:12:56.904
I just thought that your husband
might want to try one.

01:12:56.939 --> 01:12:58.406
What?

01:12:58.441 --> 01:12:59.907
Your husband.

01:13:04.113 --> 01:13:05.312
What?

01:13:23.399 --> 01:13:24.832
Hi.

01:13:26.035 --> 01:13:28.035
Peyton! Hi.

01:13:28.071 --> 01:13:29.170
Hi.

01:13:29.205 --> 01:13:31.605
I'm about to file my story
for the Christmas edition.

01:13:31.641 --> 01:13:32.940
I must admit...

01:13:32.975 --> 01:13:34.542
The party's not what I expected.

01:13:34.577 --> 01:13:35.676
It's not?

01:13:35.712 --> 01:13:36.677
- No.
- Okay.

01:13:36.713 --> 01:13:38.012
It's better.

01:13:38.047 --> 01:13:39.980
It's really spectacular.

01:13:40.016 --> 01:13:41.182
You have a gift for this.

01:13:41.217 --> 01:13:43.184
Thank you so much.

01:13:43.219 --> 01:13:44.219
You're welcome.

01:14:02.672 --> 01:14:04.872
If you'll excuse me.

01:14:15.084 --> 01:14:16.817
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:14:16.853 --> 01:14:17.885
You look incredible.

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:20.354
Thank you. You do, too.
You look very handsome.

01:14:20.389 --> 01:14:21.389
Thanks.

01:14:22.525 --> 01:14:24.158
Shall we?

01:14:29.766 --> 01:14:32.399
I really did have a fun time
this week.

01:14:32.435 --> 01:14:34.001
I did, too.

01:14:34.036 --> 01:14:36.203
You know, I didn't think
I was a Christmas guy.

01:14:36.239 --> 01:14:38.372
Well, Lily put a stop to that.

01:14:38.407 --> 01:14:40.574
You both did.

01:14:40.610 --> 01:14:42.276
Merry Christmas, Peyton.

01:14:42.311 --> 01:14:45.179
Merry Christmas, Ben.

01:14:45.214 --> 01:14:48.415
I think this party might be
my favorite tradition of all.

01:14:48.451 --> 01:14:50.618
Well, for it to be a tradition,

01:14:50.653 --> 01:14:53.420
you've got to do it every year.

01:14:56.492 --> 01:14:58.392
Can we talk?

01:14:58.427 --> 01:14:59.660
Yeah, sure.

01:15:05.601 --> 01:15:08.569
Look, first of all,
it's an interview.

01:15:08.604 --> 01:15:10.037
I might not even get the job.

01:15:10.072 --> 01:15:11.305
You're gonna get the job, Ben.

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:13.707
They'd be crazy not to hire you.

01:15:13.743 --> 01:15:15.943
So come with me.

01:15:17.613 --> 01:15:18.979
Peyton...

01:15:19.015 --> 01:15:20.915
I didn't tell you
how I felt about you

01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:22.082
the last time I left town,

01:15:22.118 --> 01:15:23.284
and that was a mistake.

01:15:23.319 --> 01:15:26.153
And then
spending this week with you,

01:15:26.189 --> 01:15:27.955
it made me see
how full my life could be,

01:15:27.990 --> 01:15:29.750
and I don't want
to walk away from that.

01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:33.260
Come with me, to Honduras.

01:15:35.965 --> 01:15:38.899
But I don't know
what I would do there.

01:15:38.935 --> 01:15:42.570
And plus, my family,
my whole life is here.

01:15:42.605 --> 01:15:45.272
And I just figured out what
I want to do with my career.

01:15:45.308 --> 01:15:47.308
I... you know,

01:15:47.343 --> 01:15:48.821
you don't have
to go on this interview.

01:15:48.845 --> 01:15:50.344
You could stay here.

01:15:50.379 --> 01:15:52.646
I want to make a difference
in people's lives.

01:15:53.983 --> 01:15:55.883
What about your life?

01:15:57.119 --> 01:15:58.452
What about that?

01:16:02.558 --> 01:16:04.859
Peyton, you're just the woman
I'm looking for.

01:16:06.162 --> 01:16:07.372
I'm interrupting something.

01:16:07.396 --> 01:16:09.630
No. No, no, it's okay.

01:16:09.665 --> 01:16:10.931
We were just...

01:16:10.967 --> 01:16:12.967
Are we finished?

01:16:14.136 --> 01:16:16.103
Yeah.

01:16:17.506 --> 01:16:18.772
I gotta pack.

01:16:20.142 --> 01:16:21.175
Yeah.

01:16:22.845 --> 01:16:24.885
- You take care of yourself.
- You take care.

01:16:31.821 --> 01:16:33.053
Hi.

01:16:33.089 --> 01:16:34.989
I wanted to tell you

01:16:35.024 --> 01:16:37.024
what a wonderful job
you've done with the party.

01:16:37.059 --> 01:16:39.960
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

01:16:39.996 --> 01:16:41.836
It's my silver anniversary
in June,

01:16:41.864 --> 01:16:45.566
and I'm in love
with what you've done here.

01:16:45.601 --> 01:16:49.670
Could I hire you
to plan my party?

01:16:53.209 --> 01:16:54.141
I would be honored.

01:16:54.176 --> 01:16:55.142
Yes.

01:16:55.177 --> 01:16:56.510
Great.

01:16:56.545 --> 01:16:58.078
Let's talk after the holidays.

01:16:58.114 --> 01:16:59.813
- You bet!
- Exciting!

01:16:59.849 --> 01:17:01.148
Exciting!

01:17:28.678 --> 01:17:29.877
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:17:29.912 --> 01:17:31.412
Hey, you can put that in back.

01:17:31.447 --> 01:17:32.913
Well...

01:17:32.949 --> 01:17:34.748
Actually,

01:17:34.784 --> 01:17:36.584
I got a Christmas present
for you.

01:17:36.619 --> 01:17:38.752
Is it a tie?

01:17:38.788 --> 01:17:40.688
Not this year.

01:17:40.723 --> 01:17:42.523
I made something for you.

01:17:48.731 --> 01:17:49.731
It's silly.

01:17:49.765 --> 01:17:52.399
It was just a, you know...

01:17:54.070 --> 01:17:55.936
Ben, I love it.

01:17:57.139 --> 01:17:58.372
Yeah?

01:17:58.407 --> 01:18:00.074
Yeah!

01:18:00.109 --> 01:18:01.342
That's great, thank you.

01:18:01.377 --> 01:18:03.077
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:18:03.112 --> 01:18:04.578
It is pretty silly.

01:18:04.613 --> 01:18:06.013
It is!

01:18:08.250 --> 01:18:11.752
Jake, I'm glad
you made it home for Christmas.

01:18:11.787 --> 01:18:13.053
Me too.

01:18:13.089 --> 01:18:16.857
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

01:18:17.893 --> 01:18:20.694
Peyton, your father and I
have something for you.

01:18:20.730 --> 01:18:22.296
It's not present time yet.

01:18:22.331 --> 01:18:23.497
Just this one.

01:18:30.139 --> 01:18:32.439
We're so proud of you, Peyton.

01:18:32.475 --> 01:18:33.741
You did great, kid.

01:18:37.346 --> 01:18:40.047
We're ordering the new
business cards next week.

01:18:40.082 --> 01:18:41.248
Business cards?

01:18:41.283 --> 01:18:44.284
"Peyton Canaday...
Event planner".

01:18:46.622 --> 01:18:47.821
Thank you.

01:18:47.857 --> 01:18:49.623
A Christmas toast...

01:18:49.658 --> 01:18:50.758
Yes.

01:18:52.661 --> 01:18:55.362
Thank you.

01:18:56.832 --> 01:18:59.233
...to this wonderful family.

01:19:00.669 --> 01:19:02.069
To family.

01:19:06.342 --> 01:19:08.008
There's a lot
of snow on the road.

01:19:08.044 --> 01:19:09.276
Yes.

01:19:09.311 --> 01:19:10.944
Which is why it's always...

01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:12.413
...good to be early.

01:19:13.516 --> 01:19:15.582
You're exactly like me.

01:19:19.955 --> 01:19:22.089
Looking forward to your trip?

01:19:23.793 --> 01:19:25.692
To be honest...

01:19:25.728 --> 01:19:28.195
I'm not sure.

01:19:28.230 --> 01:19:29.963
I don't know
if the choices I'm making

01:19:29.999 --> 01:19:32.199
will give me the life
that I want,

01:19:32.234 --> 01:19:35.302
or the life
that I'm supposed to want.

01:19:35.337 --> 01:19:39.473
Well, you're the only one
that can work that out, Ben.

01:19:39.508 --> 01:19:41.942
I hope you know you can make
different choices than I did.

01:19:43.179 --> 01:19:44.939
You'll always have
my love and support.

01:19:51.487 --> 01:19:52.487
You see that deer?

01:19:55.658 --> 01:19:57.324
It wasn't a deer.

01:19:57.359 --> 01:19:58.492
What?

01:19:59.528 --> 01:20:02.162
It was a reindeer.

01:20:13.209 --> 01:20:15.542
That smells amazing.

01:20:15.578 --> 01:20:17.511
Turkey will be ready
in two hours.

01:20:17.546 --> 01:20:20.414
I feel so bad you have to work
on Christmas day.

01:20:20.449 --> 01:20:22.683
Cooking for my family
is not work.

01:20:22.718 --> 01:20:23.984
Are you okay, sweetie?

01:20:25.121 --> 01:20:26.820
Yeah, I'm okay.

01:20:26.856 --> 01:20:29.857
Dr. Ben does not know
what he's missing.

01:20:29.892 --> 01:20:31.036
We should go make snow angels.

01:20:31.060 --> 01:20:32.159
No.

01:20:32.194 --> 01:20:33.527
Since dinner's not till 6:00,

01:20:33.562 --> 01:20:35.440
I'm gonna run Lily's gift
over to her.

01:20:35.464 --> 01:20:37.731
Okay, but don't eat
too many cookies, please.

01:20:37.766 --> 01:20:39.900
There is so much food
coming at you.

01:20:39.935 --> 01:20:41.113
This is you not stress-cooking.

01:20:41.137 --> 01:20:42.137
- Go!
- Okay!

01:20:51.413 --> 01:20:53.947
And this one is from me.

01:20:53.983 --> 01:20:55.560
That's very thoughtful
of you, Peyton.

01:20:55.584 --> 01:20:57.618
My pleasure.

01:20:57.653 --> 01:20:58.919
What is it?

01:21:00.389 --> 01:21:02.189
It's Miranda!

01:21:03.425 --> 01:21:05.559
You said you like
homemade gifts.

01:21:06.929 --> 01:21:07.861
Thank you!

01:21:07.897 --> 01:21:08.897
You're welcome.

01:21:09.732 --> 01:21:13.000
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

01:21:14.236 --> 01:21:16.103
How'd you get a horse in there?

01:21:16.138 --> 01:21:17.204
Magic.

01:21:17.239 --> 01:21:20.007
That is so cool.

01:21:25.281 --> 01:21:27.681
Goodnight, everybody!
Merry Christmas.

01:21:32.121 --> 01:21:33.121
Ben?

01:21:35.090 --> 01:21:37.057
What are you doing here?

01:21:38.994 --> 01:21:41.361
Dad was driving me
to the airport...

01:21:43.432 --> 01:21:45.199
And I saw the reindeer.

01:21:47.036 --> 01:21:49.036
You... you saw our reindeer?

01:21:50.372 --> 01:21:52.439
I don't think he wants me
to go to Honduras.

01:21:57.446 --> 01:21:59.513
And I'm realizing

01:21:59.548 --> 01:22:01.715
that I don't think
I want me to go to Honduras.

01:22:03.686 --> 01:22:05.986
My dad lived his whole life
abroad.

01:22:07.389 --> 01:22:09.122
And he was doing important work,

01:22:09.158 --> 01:22:10.824
but I don't want
to live his life.

01:22:12.061 --> 01:22:14.695
I want a home and a family.

01:22:14.730 --> 01:22:17.130
And there are plenty of groups

01:22:17.166 --> 01:22:19.099
that need doctors
to donate their time,

01:22:19.134 --> 01:22:21.768
whether overseas, or here.

01:22:23.539 --> 01:22:25.939
I can do that from Birch Creek.

01:22:43.325 --> 01:22:45.993
I should have said
this ten years ago, Peyton.

01:22:47.196 --> 01:22:48.328
I love you.

01:22:50.566 --> 01:22:53.500
And I'm really hoping
you feel the same way.

01:22:54.937 --> 01:22:56.870
I want to spend
every Christmas with you

01:22:56.905 --> 01:22:58.805
for the rest of my life.

01:22:58.841 --> 01:23:00.750
Should we make it a tradition?

01:23:12.751 --> 01:23:18.750
