WEBVTT

00:06.966 --> 00:08.884
<i>- Previously on</i> Reacher...
- The colonel's
promotion's going through.

00:08.884 --> 00:10.261
There's no way a drug operation

00:10.261 --> 00:11.595
that happened
right under his nose

00:11.595 --> 00:13.681
is gonna be publicized
in a huge bust.

00:13.681 --> 00:15.641
Operation Kite Runner
will be shut town.

00:15.641 --> 00:17.476
Mr. Reacher. Malcolm Lavoy.

00:17.476 --> 00:19.478
The people who
want this weaponry

00:19.478 --> 00:20.896
can never be allowed to have it.

00:20.896 --> 00:22.732
If they knew you were involved
in the shady dealings

00:22.732 --> 00:24.650
that created Little Wing
in the first place,

00:24.650 --> 00:25.693
you'd be indicted.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.778
I'm prepared to give you
whatever you need.

00:27.778 --> 00:29.488
Why'd you send us
to get killed in an ambush?

00:29.488 --> 00:31.657
Our head of security told me
to give you that address.

00:31.657 --> 00:33.492
- Not Tony Swan?
- No.

00:33.492 --> 00:35.286
He's the one trying
to stop all this.

00:35.286 --> 00:36.787
Langston is vicious.

00:36.787 --> 00:37.955
If I didn't cooperate...

00:37.955 --> 00:39.248
<i>things that he
said he would have</i>

00:39.248 --> 00:40.708
<i>done to my daughter.</i>

00:43.711 --> 00:45.212
I want you to run down that way.

00:49.508 --> 00:51.594
It's not always fair, kid.

00:54.180 --> 00:56.140
Hold on, Russo.

00:56.140 --> 00:57.516
- The girl.
- She's okay.

01:13.657 --> 01:15.075
All right, we need
to get you two

01:15.075 --> 01:16.577
out of town to somewhere safe.

01:16.577 --> 01:19.246
I take it Chad's house
was the one place

01:19.246 --> 01:20.372
you thought you
wouldn't be found?

01:20.372 --> 01:21.957
Yeah.

01:21.957 --> 01:24.668
Everyone I trust
with my life or anyone else's

01:24.668 --> 01:26.629
is already involved
in this thing.

01:26.629 --> 01:28.714
Even Finlay up in Boston.

01:28.714 --> 01:31.342
What about Roscoe?
You trust her.

01:31.342 --> 01:33.552
Who's Roscoe?

01:37.848 --> 01:40.601
She's a friend back in Margrave.

01:43.854 --> 01:46.440
Senator Lavoy knew
what happened down there.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.692
If he was able to find out,
Langston could have, too,

01:48.692 --> 01:51.111
and potentially track
Marlo and Jane to Georgia.

01:51.111 --> 01:53.405
Neagley, Dixon, was there
ever a time in your life

01:53.405 --> 01:55.241
when you had very little
attachment to a place?

01:55.241 --> 01:57.326
Digitally, via paper trail,

01:57.326 --> 01:58.452
even emotionally?

01:58.452 --> 01:59.954
It'd have to be after
the military,

01:59.954 --> 02:02.373
'cause the Army knew every time
we scratched our asses.

02:02.373 --> 02:04.583
A few months after
I was discharged,

02:04.583 --> 02:06.210
I went to Buffalo.

02:06.210 --> 02:08.504
Worked in-house at this
debt collection agency.

02:08.504 --> 02:10.172
Only lasted six months
before I quit.

02:10.172 --> 02:11.215
It was a dirty business.

02:11.215 --> 02:12.925
Did you rent
while you were there?

02:12.925 --> 02:14.802
Yeah. Private residence,
apartment over a garage.

02:14.802 --> 02:18.556
Good. No property records.
Landline?

02:18.556 --> 02:20.391
Just my cell phone.
Non-local area code.

02:20.391 --> 02:21.725
- Utilities?
- Nope. Included in the rent.

02:21.725 --> 02:24.812
Well, that's
pretty much perfect.

02:24.812 --> 02:26.021
Anyone there you trust?

02:26.021 --> 02:28.274
My landlord, Bob Lee.
Retired firefighter.

02:28.274 --> 02:30.609
Old-school Irishman.
Lives for his grandkids.

02:30.609 --> 02:32.695
Like that
he was a firefighter.

02:32.695 --> 02:34.321
They have a sense of duty
and honor.

02:34.321 --> 02:36.115
I slipped on ice
in the driveway once,

02:36.115 --> 02:37.616
knocked myself out cold.

02:37.616 --> 02:39.159
Mr. Lee found me, picked me up,

02:39.159 --> 02:41.996
drove me through a blizzard
to Kenmore Mercy.

02:41.996 --> 02:43.330
Guy was 70 at the time.

02:43.330 --> 02:44.748
I don't just trust him
with my life.

02:44.748 --> 02:46.667
He may have
actually saved it once.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.085
You think he'd do you a favor?

02:48.085 --> 02:50.671
I send him homemade soda bread
on St. Patrick's Day

02:50.671 --> 02:52.590
and he calls me every year
on my birthday, so yeah,

02:52.590 --> 02:54.842
- I think he'd do me a favor.
- Buffalo it is.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.302
Great,
I'll give him a call.

02:58.929 --> 03:00.514
It won't be forever.

03:00.514 --> 03:02.808
We just need to kill
a few more people.

03:10.024 --> 03:11.442
Who wants treats?

03:11.442 --> 03:13.944
There was a shitload of options
at the vending machine,

03:13.944 --> 03:17.197
so I kind of got
a sampler's pack there.

03:20.367 --> 03:22.161
What?

03:22.161 --> 03:24.121
Um, can we have candy

03:24.121 --> 03:26.081
or do we need to talk
about murder some more?

03:44.516 --> 03:47.061
That's the only Clark Bar.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.317
So, what's the plan?

03:53.317 --> 03:55.152
O'Donnell and Dixon'll
make sure Marlo and Jane

03:55.152 --> 03:56.820
get off safely.

03:56.820 --> 03:59.073
Neagley and I have business
with Lieutenant Marsh.

03:59.073 --> 04:01.200
Russo's boss?

04:01.200 --> 04:02.785
Russo confronts him
about being dirty

04:02.785 --> 04:04.620
and dies within hours?

04:04.620 --> 04:06.872
I'd say we have a lot
to talk about.

04:24.515 --> 04:26.642
Car's in the driveway.

04:26.642 --> 04:28.644
Decent chance he's home.

04:28.644 --> 04:31.355
I want eyes out here in case
any of Marsh's pals show up.

04:31.355 --> 04:32.523
Copy that.

04:32.523 --> 04:34.900
Reacher.

04:36.652 --> 04:39.655
A good man
died in my arms last night.

04:39.655 --> 04:41.949
Whatever you do to Marsh,

04:41.949 --> 04:44.034
make him feel it.

05:13.022 --> 05:14.523
Is that the going price

05:14.523 --> 05:16.442
of an honest cop's life
these days?

05:18.652 --> 05:21.155
You can try, but that
wouldn't be smart.

05:21.155 --> 05:24.825
Listen, I did not want Russo
to die, all right?

05:24.825 --> 05:26.785
They guy worked under me
since he was a rookie.

05:26.785 --> 05:28.954
That's why you
couldn't do it yourself.

05:28.954 --> 05:30.664
So you made a call.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.833
Just like Langston called
those bikers in Boston.

05:32.833 --> 05:35.085
Cowards like you never
like to get your hands dirty.

05:35.085 --> 05:36.545
No, it wasn't like that.
Okay, yeah,

05:36.545 --> 05:38.756
I told Langston
that Russo was onto him,

05:38.756 --> 05:40.507
but I didn't think
in a million years

05:40.507 --> 05:42.593
that they would kill him.

05:42.593 --> 05:44.094
I figured he's wise up
when they dropped

05:44.094 --> 05:45.679
a bag of cash at his feet.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.389
- Like that one?
- Yeah.

05:47.389 --> 05:50.392
- Who the hell wouldn't
take this kind of money?
- Russo wouldn't.

05:50.392 --> 05:53.228
And anyone who knew him as long
as you did would know that.

05:53.228 --> 05:56.023
So when you called Langston, you
knew exactly what would happen.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.775
Go for it...

05:57.775 --> 06:00.778
if you really think you can
grab it and fire before I do.

06:00.778 --> 06:03.238
Or you can tell me
what I want to know

06:03.238 --> 06:05.532
and use that phone
to turn yourself in.

06:05.532 --> 06:07.951
Prison's not a great place
for ex-cops,

06:07.951 --> 06:10.245
but it's better
than the alternative.

06:10.245 --> 06:11.622
Barely.

06:18.670 --> 06:20.672
Aah! Ow!

06:20.672 --> 06:22.925
You just used up
your last bit of goodwill.

06:25.177 --> 06:27.179
Ow.

06:27.179 --> 06:29.098
We know the buyer--
Mahmoud, Mason, Marino

06:29.098 --> 06:31.183
or whatever the hell
he calls himself--

06:31.183 --> 06:32.935
will soon come into possession

06:32.935 --> 06:35.646
of 650 shoulder-fired
surface-to-air missiles,

06:35.646 --> 06:38.315
and that he's due to meet with
Langston and a New Age engineer

06:38.315 --> 06:40.526
to get the Little Wing software
chips installed in the hardware.

06:40.526 --> 06:43.737
I need to know when and where
that meeting's taking place.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.572
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

06:45.572 --> 06:47.241
Nobody ever said anything
like that to me.

06:47.241 --> 06:48.408
Ow, ow!

06:48.408 --> 06:51.578
Oh, God! God... Stop. Please.

06:51.578 --> 06:53.831
I swear I'm telling the truth.

06:53.831 --> 06:56.917
Langston hired me
to keep tabs on Russo

06:56.917 --> 06:59.086
and just tell him when
he got close, that's it.

06:59.086 --> 07:01.046
- Then I guess we're done here.
- No, no, wait, wait!

07:01.046 --> 07:02.923
Stop, stop. Um...

07:02.923 --> 07:05.342
Um, look, uh,
Grant-Grant would know.

07:05.342 --> 07:07.678
- Who's Grant?
- He's the guy
you ran over last night.

07:07.678 --> 07:09.304
- He's dead.
- He's not.

07:09.304 --> 07:10.931
Turn-turn on the news.
He's not dead.

07:10.931 --> 07:13.892
He's in intensive care
in Mount Sinai.

07:15.060 --> 07:17.437
See?

07:17.437 --> 07:20.107
Being an honest cop
isn't that hard.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.567
Just ask Russo.

07:21.567 --> 07:25.779
Oh, wait. You can't.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.384
We're square.

07:54.266 --> 07:57.144
Okay. No one's gonna be
looking for you in Buffalo,

07:57.144 --> 07:58.770
but if you guys feel like
you need to stretch your legs,

07:58.770 --> 08:01.315
even just for a block or two,
wear these.

08:01.315 --> 08:03.483
Pull 'em down tight,
low to your eyebrows.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.360
Small precaution,
big benefits, right?

08:05.360 --> 08:06.945
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Okay.

08:06.945 --> 08:09.448
Driver's got five grand
in cash in-pocket.

08:09.448 --> 08:12.034
That guarantees you a safe trip
to Dixon's friend's place.

08:12.034 --> 08:13.785
Okay.

08:16.872 --> 08:18.081
Okay, Jane?

08:18.081 --> 08:19.166
Yeah.

08:19.166 --> 08:22.419
This isn't gonna do.

08:22.419 --> 08:23.879
Well...

08:23.879 --> 08:27.299
You know, when my boys
started in T-ball,

08:27.299 --> 08:29.259
I had to teach 'em
how to break in a cap.

08:29.259 --> 08:32.888
And I know everyone thinks it's
cool to wear 'em straight brim,

08:32.888 --> 08:36.391
but I'm trying to bring back
the classic look.

08:36.391 --> 08:38.602
- You want to help me out?
- Sure.

08:43.232 --> 08:45.734
How's that?

08:45.734 --> 08:46.735
It's good.

08:46.735 --> 08:48.612
Yeah? Let me see.

08:48.612 --> 08:51.156
There you go.

08:51.156 --> 08:53.867
Okay.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.661
Hey.

08:55.661 --> 08:57.454
You're gonna be fine.

08:57.454 --> 09:00.207
Your mom, she's pretty brave.

09:00.207 --> 09:01.875
And the dangerous stuff--
that's over.

09:01.875 --> 09:05.420
So you'll be all right.
I promise.

09:05.420 --> 09:06.964
- Okay.
- Okay?

09:06.964 --> 09:09.341
There you go.

09:09.341 --> 09:11.510
Okay, well, uh...

09:11.510 --> 09:13.971
Typically, it's hard for women
to say goodbye to me,

09:13.971 --> 09:15.222
so let's get you girls
out of here

09:15.222 --> 09:17.474
before you get too attached.

09:23.480 --> 09:25.899
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

09:29.736 --> 09:31.863
Speed limit all the way, sir.

09:37.244 --> 09:39.288
You're good with the kid.

09:39.288 --> 09:41.123
Would've been
a good girl-dad, too.

09:41.123 --> 09:42.416
Ah, kids are kids.

09:42.416 --> 09:43.792
Don't talk to them
like they're idiots,

09:43.792 --> 09:45.836
usually pretty easy.

09:47.546 --> 09:50.090
You know, we got this.
Reacher, Neagley, and I.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.509
You don't have
to finish this out.

09:52.509 --> 09:54.970
What's that supposed to mean?

09:54.970 --> 09:57.973
It means you've got more
at stake than the rest of us.

09:57.973 --> 10:01.226
If you want, you can
walk away with your chin up.

10:01.226 --> 10:02.728
With my chin up?

10:02.728 --> 10:04.271
Yeah.

10:04.271 --> 10:07.107
Really gonna try
and pull that line with me?

10:10.277 --> 10:12.070
Aw, fuck it,
it was worth a shot.

10:12.070 --> 10:13.864
Yeah, let's get to work, buddy.

10:13.864 --> 10:15.615
Hooah!

10:17.075 --> 10:18.702
I know with
the training holiday coming up,

10:18.702 --> 10:20.954
some of you may have made plans.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.415
Those plans might have
included heading off base.

10:23.415 --> 10:25.459
- Not necessarily.
- What gave you that idea?

10:25.459 --> 10:27.502
But I just heard from
one of our sources

10:27.502 --> 10:30.172
on Operation Kite Runner.

10:30.172 --> 10:31.715
The big buy
is happening tonight.

10:31.715 --> 10:33.508
Hm. Where?

10:33.508 --> 10:34.634
Some abandoned,
military-owned land

10:34.634 --> 10:36.219
about five klicks
northwest of base.

10:36.219 --> 10:38.722
The overflow lot? Motor pool
guys used to go there to drink.

10:38.722 --> 10:40.140
With the DONSA
and everyone

10:40.140 --> 10:42.309
clearing out for the weekend,
someone thought

10:42.309 --> 10:45.354
this would be the perfect time
to offload supply.

10:45.354 --> 10:47.522
- They're wrong.
- Weren't we told
in no uncertain terms

10:47.522 --> 10:49.524
that there were to be
no wide-scale arrests,

10:49.524 --> 10:51.693
no conspiracy charges, just,

10:51.693 --> 10:53.362
you know, accept the fact
they were FUBARing

10:53.362 --> 10:55.238
our entire operation
and that was that?

10:55.238 --> 10:58.033
Yes. That's what we were told.

10:58.033 --> 10:59.826
As the longest
tooth here,

10:59.826 --> 11:01.912
I just want to make sure
you understand the ramifications

11:01.912 --> 11:03.872
of going through
with this, Reacher.

11:03.872 --> 11:05.374
I know them
inside and out.

11:05.374 --> 11:07.334
I know that tonight
will be the culmination

11:07.334 --> 11:08.960
of two years
of incredibly hard work

11:08.960 --> 11:11.463
by every member of this team.

11:11.463 --> 11:13.090
I know that defying
a direct order

11:13.090 --> 11:16.551
will permanently damage
and possibly end career paths.

11:16.551 --> 11:18.512
We may not be discharged,
but they'll sure as hell

11:18.512 --> 11:20.472
make us wish we were.

11:20.472 --> 11:22.057
Busted in rank,

11:22.057 --> 11:24.518
shit assignments in
the worst corners of the globe.

11:25.977 --> 11:27.354
But if we do this,

11:27.354 --> 11:29.981
we'll be taking out an operation
pumping thousands of kilos

11:29.981 --> 11:31.441
of heroin into the country.

11:31.441 --> 11:33.735
And we'll be making sure
the criminals hiding behind

11:33.735 --> 11:35.195
the name
of the United States Army

11:35.195 --> 11:38.073
know they can't do so
with impunity.

11:39.533 --> 11:41.118
I think that's an okay trade.

11:42.411 --> 11:44.037
But since I probably have

11:44.037 --> 11:46.331
18 hours left as your CO...

11:48.542 --> 11:50.502
...I'll leave you to make
your own decision.

11:51.503 --> 11:54.589
If any of you don't want
to be involved, I understand.

11:54.589 --> 11:56.925
I couldn't respect you more.

11:58.385 --> 12:00.011
And every one of you
are free to walk out of here

12:00.011 --> 12:02.597
right now with
your chin held high.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.750
Then let's get to work.

12:43.805 --> 12:45.849
They're here, Lieutenant.

12:48.935 --> 12:50.770
Hold on.

12:56.943 --> 12:58.236
Shit.

12:58.236 --> 13:01.114
Don't move! Hands out and up.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.782
On whose orders?

13:02.782 --> 13:04.993
Major Jack Reacher
of the 110th Military Police

13:04.993 --> 13:06.620
Special Investigations Unit.

13:06.620 --> 13:08.663
We have reason to believe
these vehicles have been used

13:08.663 --> 13:10.165
to transport
Schedule One narcotics.

13:10.165 --> 13:12.000
Kneel with fingers
interlocked behind your head

13:12.000 --> 13:14.002
while we conduct our search.

13:14.002 --> 13:16.379
- You don't have a warrant.
- This is
the military.

13:16.379 --> 13:19.299
We don't need a search warrant.
On your knees.

13:21.259 --> 13:24.262
You heard the major. Kneel.

13:25.514 --> 13:27.516
Let's go, sunshine.

13:28.517 --> 13:32.771
Neagley, Lowrey,
watch these soldiers.

14:05.136 --> 14:09.099
- Damn it!
- Perhaps you were misinformed.

14:22.112 --> 14:24.030
- O'Donnell.
- Yeah?

14:24.030 --> 14:25.407
Switchblade.

14:42.340 --> 14:44.634
Light...

14:44.634 --> 14:47.387
Got a patch on this one, too.

14:48.638 --> 14:50.223
Ditto that over here.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.395
They're on all of them.

15:01.526 --> 15:02.902
You're under arrest.

15:05.030 --> 15:07.449
My buyers might have something
to say about that.

15:07.449 --> 15:10.952
Cops! Light 'em up!

15:47.113 --> 15:48.948
Duck!

16:54.222 --> 16:55.890
Thanks, kid.

17:09.612 --> 17:10.989
Shit.

17:27.839 --> 17:28.757
Aah!

17:40.226 --> 17:42.687
- Everybody good?
- Yeah.

17:44.314 --> 17:45.940
- Yeah.
- You good?

17:45.940 --> 17:48.026
Got a runner.

18:08.213 --> 18:10.006
Aah!

18:16.012 --> 18:19.724
Oh, my G...
You broke my fucking leg.

18:19.724 --> 18:21.351
I broke the fence.

18:21.351 --> 18:23.436
The fall broke your leg.

18:26.064 --> 18:28.149
Shut up.

18:41.496 --> 18:43.706
I am starting to see the appeal

18:43.706 --> 18:45.708
of your minimalistic lifestyle.

18:45.708 --> 18:47.544
Never too late to join me.

18:47.544 --> 18:49.087
Can I bring my guitar?

18:49.087 --> 18:50.880
- Nope.
- I'm out.

18:50.880 --> 18:53.341
- Can't forget this, <i>hermano.</i>
- Mm?

18:53.341 --> 18:55.176
Oh.

18:55.176 --> 18:56.970
My lucky lighter.

18:56.970 --> 18:58.596
Oh.

18:58.596 --> 19:00.223
I am definitely

19:00.223 --> 19:02.058
hanging onto this

19:02.058 --> 19:04.185
to show your future wife.

19:04.185 --> 19:06.271
Yeah, well, you're gonna
be holding onto that

19:06.271 --> 19:07.814
for a hell of a long time

19:07.814 --> 19:11.150
because I am
unattached for life.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.902
Ah. Well, I just want to say,

19:12.902 --> 19:16.739
on behalf of all women
everywhere, thank you.

19:16.739 --> 19:20.660
Hey, I had these printed out
in case anyone wants one.

19:20.660 --> 19:23.162
You know, a kind of
sort of keepsake thing.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.581
There you go.

19:24.581 --> 19:26.291
Sweet. Thanks, Franzy.

19:26.291 --> 19:28.293
Yeah, yeah, of course.

19:28.293 --> 19:30.545
Thanks, sucker.

19:30.545 --> 19:32.630
- Lose it.
- Yeah.

19:40.597 --> 19:42.056
Thanks, boss.

19:42.056 --> 19:43.892
Won't be your boss for long.

19:43.892 --> 19:46.102
Well, I guess I'm gonna
have to savor it while it lasts.

19:46.102 --> 19:48.396
Who knows when we're gonna
see each other again?

19:48.396 --> 19:50.481
Why would anyone
want to see these clowns?

19:50.481 --> 19:52.150
Wasn't talking about them.

19:53.735 --> 19:55.945
Oh, here we go.

19:55.945 --> 19:57.655
"Free Bird," extended version.

19:57.655 --> 20:00.909
Hell, no. You know the rules.

20:00.909 --> 20:03.786
But I got something
even better.

20:03.786 --> 20:05.204
'Cause we sure did go crazy

20:05.204 --> 20:06.706

21:06.933 --> 21:08.977
Maybe not officially.

21:08.977 --> 21:12.730
But rest assured, Uncle Sam
will get his pound of flesh,

21:12.730 --> 21:14.732

21:14.732 --> 21:18.403

21:18.403 --> 21:21.489

21:23.491 --> 21:26.077
Don't stand at attention

21:27.120 --> 21:30.915
I told you how
I wanted this case wrapped up.

21:30.915 --> 21:32.333
Yes, sir.

21:32.333 --> 21:34.544
Why'd you fuck me?

21:34.544 --> 21:38.047
If you're looking for an
apology, there isn't one coming.

21:39.298 --> 21:40.967
You know,

21:40.967 --> 21:43.970
when you first got the 110th,

21:43.970 --> 21:45.596
all the brass said that

21:45.596 --> 21:48.599
you would eventually fuck it up.

21:48.599 --> 21:50.768
Glad I didn't disappoint.

21:52.311 --> 21:54.355
110th...

21:54.355 --> 21:57.400
Special Investigators Unit,

21:57.400 --> 22:00.111
you're all hereby
relieved of your duty.

22:01.696 --> 22:03.740
Effective immediately.

22:25.136 --> 22:28.389

22:28.389 --> 22:30.141

22:59.629 --> 23:01.881

23:01.881 --> 23:04.175
would see the outline
of a weapon in these scrubs.

23:04.175 --> 23:06.594
We go in nice and easy,
get the info we need

23:06.594 --> 23:08.221
and we're gone.

23:08.221 --> 23:09.847
Fine.

23:09.847 --> 23:12.433
But nothing with you
is ever nice and easy.

23:19.690 --> 23:21.234
Hi, Grant.

23:21.234 --> 23:23.402
You yell or make noise,
I'll tear your trachea out

23:23.402 --> 23:25.613
and your last thought'll be,
"Holy shit, he really did it."

23:25.613 --> 23:27.615
When and where
is Langston meeting his buyer?

23:27.615 --> 23:30.409
- I don't know.
- I think you do.

23:30.409 --> 23:32.328
You're a loose end who's
gonna be questioned as soon as

23:32.328 --> 23:34.122
he's medically cleared.
You don't think Langston

23:34.122 --> 23:36.916
has someone on the way here
right now to take you out?

23:36.916 --> 23:38.709
I don't know anything.

23:47.176 --> 23:49.303
Let's make sure.

23:54.559 --> 23:57.478
What the hell?

24:01.941 --> 24:03.359
What are you doing?

24:04.318 --> 24:06.362
Hey! What are...

24:06.362 --> 24:08.281
Shh, shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh, shh.

24:08.281 --> 24:09.699
You know
how a catheter works?

24:09.699 --> 24:11.159
There's a balloon inflated
in your bladder

24:11.159 --> 24:13.077
holding it in place.

24:13.077 --> 24:14.912
If I fill the balloon port
with air, it'll burst

24:14.912 --> 24:18.166
the balloon and tear your
urethra apart like a piñata.

24:18.166 --> 24:20.209
I've messed up a lot of guys
a lot of ways,

24:20.209 --> 24:22.253
but I've never done that.

24:22.253 --> 24:24.797
To be honest, I'm kind of
curious how you'll react.

24:24.797 --> 24:27.091
So if I were you,
I'd start talking.

24:29.969 --> 24:32.305
Okay, here we go.

24:45.193 --> 24:47.486
I can't understand
a word he's saying.

24:52.116 --> 24:53.701
Okay, okay. Fuck.

24:53.701 --> 24:56.162
Fuck.

24:56.162 --> 24:57.413
Langston's meeting
the buyer tomorrow.

24:57.413 --> 24:58.915
- What time?
- Five a.m.

24:58.915 --> 25:00.333
Where?

25:00.333 --> 25:03.252
Langston keeps things
on a need-to-know basis.

25:04.337 --> 25:06.339
That's it, I swear.

25:09.133 --> 25:11.510
Fuck!

25:11.510 --> 25:13.596
Keep it the hell down, buddy.

25:21.020 --> 25:23.022
I swear to God...

25:23.022 --> 25:25.316
I told you all I know.

25:30.780 --> 25:32.406
Lucky for you,
it looks suspicious

25:32.406 --> 25:33.616
when your insides blow up.

25:33.616 --> 25:35.910
Hospital checks
security cameras,

25:35.910 --> 25:39.163
sees us coming in here,
causes all kinds of trouble.

25:41.374 --> 25:43.709
But if you have an embolism
after a car accident...

25:47.546 --> 25:49.715
...no one suspects a thing.

25:49.715 --> 25:51.008
What?

25:52.051 --> 25:55.513
A gift... from Gaitano Russo.

25:57.014 --> 25:58.975
No.

26:13.823 --> 26:15.741
- Hurry! Over here! Come here!
- Out of the way, please.

26:15.741 --> 26:16.951
- He's flatlining.
- Hands on deck.

26:16.951 --> 26:18.202
I need a crash cart!

26:18.202 --> 26:20.288
We have a Code Blue!
Move, move!

26:20.288 --> 26:22.707
That way.

26:30.464 --> 26:32.758
Up ahead.
Doctor scrubs, but look

26:32.758 --> 26:34.927
at the stethoscope.
Only nurses carry paper tape.

26:34.927 --> 26:36.846
Looks like
he grabbed what he could

26:36.846 --> 26:38.556
and threw it on,
just like we did.

26:38.556 --> 26:40.308
Langston hates loose ends.

26:40.308 --> 26:42.476
Doc's coming for Grant.

26:43.519 --> 26:44.603
Oh!

28:38.551 --> 28:40.428
Fuck you!

28:54.733 --> 28:56.735
Shit.

28:56.735 --> 28:58.904
I wanted to question him.

29:09.290 --> 29:12.751
Maybe we can still
get some answers?

29:14.462 --> 29:16.797
Give me some good news.

29:16.797 --> 29:18.883
Sure. You're down another man,

29:18.883 --> 29:21.093
but I left his body
in the morgue for convenience.

29:24.847 --> 29:26.765
Oh, that's okay.

29:26.765 --> 29:29.560
Since you've made it a habit
of taking out my guys,

29:29.560 --> 29:32.229
I've come up
with my own contingency plan

29:32.229 --> 29:33.814
<i>and I've got two of your guys.</i>

29:33.814 --> 29:35.399
Bullshit.

29:35.399 --> 29:38.444
<i>See, I still know people
in the police department.</i>

29:38.444 --> 29:41.238
And after the untimely death
of Officer Russo,

29:41.238 --> 29:44.200
I had the GPS
on his precinct car run.

29:44.200 --> 29:48.078
Nothing unusual, except for
a visit to the Jade East Motel,

29:48.078 --> 29:50.164
a by-the-hour tug joint

29:50.164 --> 29:52.166
that that Boy Scout
would never visit

29:52.166 --> 29:53.626
unless he was working a case.

29:53.626 --> 29:55.628
<i>Just so happened
it was the same night</i>

29:55.628 --> 29:58.506
<i>as a hell of a fender-bender
in the New Age lobby.</i>

29:58.506 --> 30:00.674
So, today,

30:00.674 --> 30:02.676
I sent some of my boys
over there

30:02.676 --> 30:05.095
and guess what they found?

30:05.095 --> 30:06.472
Your pals.

30:06.472 --> 30:07.723
What do you want?

30:07.723 --> 30:09.975
<i>I got an R & D facility
in Rockland County.</i>

30:09.975 --> 30:12.394
<i>You and your buddy
surrender your weapon</i>

30:12.394 --> 30:16.148
<i>and stay under the watch of
my men there till this is over.</i>

30:16.148 --> 30:18.317
<i>And then
I'll let you all go, alive.</i>

30:18.317 --> 30:20.069
Says a guy
who doesn't like loose ends.

30:20.069 --> 30:22.488
<i>You know, this has gone
way too far.</i>

30:22.488 --> 30:25.157
<i>But soon, my associates
and I will have $65 million</i>

30:25.157 --> 30:27.201
and we won't have a reason
to kill you.

30:27.201 --> 30:30.663
More bodies means
more bullshit, so you

30:30.663 --> 30:32.623
<i>and your cohort come here,</i>

30:32.623 --> 30:35.251
<i>and this is over for all of us
before you know it.</i>

30:35.251 --> 30:37.378
My cohort's name is Neagley.

30:37.378 --> 30:39.296
And she's dead.

30:40.339 --> 30:41.924
Your guy killed her
in the hospital basement.

30:41.924 --> 30:44.051
Then I slit his jugular
with a bone saw.

30:44.051 --> 30:46.804
Then you come here now.

30:46.804 --> 30:48.722
But if you fuck around
and call the cops,

30:48.722 --> 30:50.516
I'll kill the only two friends
you have left.

30:50.516 --> 30:52.017
<i>Cops are already here.</i>

30:52.017 --> 30:53.435
I'm at the scene
of a double homicide

30:53.435 --> 30:54.853
waiting to be questioned.

30:54.853 --> 30:56.522
I leave now,
they start tailing me.

30:56.522 --> 30:57.982
You want them
following me to you?

30:57.982 --> 31:00.109
<i>I'll be there sometime tonight.</i>

31:00.109 --> 31:03.070
When I show up,
I need proof of life.

31:03.070 --> 31:04.738
<i>Oh, you'll get it.</i>

31:04.738 --> 31:08.075
But if you try anything cute,
you'll get proof of death.

31:11.537 --> 31:13.539
Langston was a cop for 30 years.

31:13.539 --> 31:15.165
You don't think
he can pull a few strings

31:15.165 --> 31:16.875
and find out
I'm not at the coroner's?

31:16.875 --> 31:20.254
Eventually. Until then,
I bought us some time.

31:20.254 --> 31:22.047
To do what?

31:25.801 --> 31:27.303
Yeah.

31:27.303 --> 31:29.847
<i>There's a Jack Margrave
on the line for you.</i>

31:29.847 --> 31:32.641
<i>He says it's urgent.</i>

31:32.641 --> 31:34.810
Put him through.

31:37.187 --> 31:40.691
<i>- Mr. Reacher.</i>
- I'm about to tear
the apple cart to pieces.

31:40.691 --> 31:43.068
You still prepared
to give me everything I need?

31:43.068 --> 31:44.486
<i>One hundred percent.</i>

31:44.486 --> 31:47.448
Your private security--
former SEALs and Rangers?

31:47.448 --> 31:49.533
<i>Two SEALs, one Ranger.</i>

31:49.533 --> 31:51.243
Good. I need 'em.

31:51.243 --> 31:52.786
<i>Well, if that's what
it's gonna take</i>

31:52.786 --> 31:54.288
<i>to make all this go away, done.</i>

31:54.288 --> 31:57.041
Look, Reacher,

31:57.041 --> 32:00.085
I know that you think I'm some
feckless scumbag politician,

32:00.085 --> 32:02.421
but I was just trying
to do right by our country.

32:02.421 --> 32:06.550
<i>Yes, maybe I...
maybe I wet my beak a little.</i>

32:06.550 --> 32:08.844
But I didn't know that
it would lead to people dying.

32:08.844 --> 32:10.304
You got to believe me on that.

32:10.304 --> 32:12.890
You want absolution,
talk to a priest.

32:12.890 --> 32:16.143
Now, here's exactly
what I need you to do.

32:24.610 --> 32:26.779
Lot of
exterior lighting.

32:27.821 --> 32:29.823
Anyone trying to cross
is gonna get lit up

32:29.823 --> 32:32.117
like a Wrigley Field night game.

32:32.117 --> 32:35.829
Not to mention the camera mounts
all around the perimeter.

32:36.872 --> 32:39.041
Langston said if anything
suspicious goes down,

32:39.041 --> 32:40.959
he'll kill Dixon and O'Donnell.

32:42.002 --> 32:43.837
There's no way to initiate
a plan from the outside

32:43.837 --> 32:46.340
without putting them at risk.

32:46.340 --> 32:48.842
That's why I have to do this
from the inside.

32:48.842 --> 32:50.761
Get a jump on 'em.

32:51.929 --> 32:55.015
You're just gonna walk in there?

32:55.015 --> 32:56.767
You have no idea
what he's gonna do to you.

32:56.767 --> 32:58.936
That's not exactly true.

32:58.936 --> 33:01.146
We saw Franz's autopsy record.

33:03.190 --> 33:06.110
Cuffs, torture?

33:06.110 --> 33:08.320
No, Reacher.

33:10.906 --> 33:14.201
Don't worry. I'm not just
gonna lie down and take it.

33:17.246 --> 33:19.707

33:19.707 --> 33:21.834

33:29.675 --> 33:31.135

33:31.135 --> 33:32.678

33:32.678 --> 33:36.682
I told you punks this is
private property. Now beat it.

33:36.682 --> 33:38.517
Private property
starts at the fence, man.

33:38.517 --> 33:40.853
My parents pay for this road
with their tax dollars.

33:40.853 --> 33:42.855
If you don't get out of here,
I'm not gonna

33:42.855 --> 33:45.858

33:59.913 --> 34:01.999

34:05.627 --> 34:07.713
No.

34:08.922 --> 34:11.175
'Cause he just gave me an idea.

34:36.492 --> 34:38.118
Sir.

34:39.578 --> 34:41.580
You're on time.

34:41.580 --> 34:43.791
Though it's expected,
it is still appreciated.

34:43.791 --> 34:45.876
Show me, please.

35:25.123 --> 35:27.125
Perfect.

35:38.971 --> 35:41.431
The New Age engineer
who has the Little Wing chips.

35:42.850 --> 35:44.184
Take me to him.

35:47.396 --> 35:50.065
Guy your pal Reacher
killed in the hospital?

35:51.275 --> 35:53.777
We were on the force
with him for years.

35:56.154 --> 35:58.532
Someone that you served with

35:58.532 --> 36:00.951
getting violently killed?

36:00.951 --> 36:03.078
Well...

36:03.078 --> 36:05.038
I have no idea
what that feels like.

36:12.045 --> 36:14.172
He's a funny one.

36:15.382 --> 36:17.509
He's got
his funny little remarks.

36:18.927 --> 36:21.179
His funny little toys.

36:22.723 --> 36:24.308
You know, these things

36:24.308 --> 36:26.393
don't do any good
if you don't keep 'em sharp.

36:29.104 --> 36:31.273
Let's see how well
you maintain your tools.

36:31.273 --> 36:33.317
Aah!

36:46.580 --> 36:48.290
Okay.

36:50.334 --> 36:52.502
It's time.

36:52.502 --> 36:54.421
Hold on.

36:55.505 --> 36:57.341
What?

36:58.342 --> 37:00.761
Nothing. It's just...

37:02.012 --> 37:05.265
I've been thinking about
Operation Kite Runner lately.

37:05.265 --> 37:07.267
Strange.

37:07.267 --> 37:09.144
So have I.

37:09.144 --> 37:12.230
We went into that case knowing
it was a losing proposition.

37:13.231 --> 37:14.691
And we all got burned.

37:17.527 --> 37:19.321
Kind of getting
that same vibe now.

37:20.781 --> 37:23.784
We put bad guys in the ground,
we put bad guys in jail.

37:25.118 --> 37:27.412
I prefer the former,
but it was far from a loss.

37:29.873 --> 37:32.376
It killed the 110th, figuratively.

37:33.794 --> 37:37.422
And now someone's actually
killing the 110th, literally.

37:39.049 --> 37:41.426
You're about to walk
into a buzzsaw, Reacher.

37:42.511 --> 37:44.304
This plan?

37:45.973 --> 37:47.557
We might die.

37:48.558 --> 37:51.144
Everyone dies eventually.

37:51.144 --> 37:52.729
I'm aware.

37:52.729 --> 37:55.190
But I'd prefer
to not do it today.

37:55.190 --> 37:56.900
Wouldn't you?

37:57.943 --> 38:00.195
People live and then they die.

38:00.195 --> 38:02.030
As long as we do both properly,

38:02.030 --> 38:04.074
there's nothing much to regret.

38:08.120 --> 38:09.955
If this goes to shit,
I just don't want to be

38:09.955 --> 38:11.832
the last living member
of our outfit.

38:11.832 --> 38:14.418
We investigated, we prepared.

38:14.418 --> 38:16.586
Now we execute.

38:16.586 --> 38:19.089
And I have my best soldier
covering my ass, right?

38:20.173 --> 38:21.925
Damn right.

38:23.051 --> 38:25.512
Besides, if this
all went to shit,

38:25.512 --> 38:28.807
you wouldn't be the last member
of the 110th for long.

38:28.807 --> 38:31.643
They'd kill you within 24 hours.

38:39.651 --> 38:41.570
