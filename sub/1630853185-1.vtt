WEBVTT

01:57.417 --> 01:59.219
We have a problem.

02:34.956 --> 02:37.257
How the hell
did he find these guys?

02:37.290 --> 02:40.494
You know, Manson booked
himself a date.

02:40.527 --> 02:42.462
You see that girl?

02:42.496 --> 02:44.364
Yeah,
they're supposed to blend in.

02:44.398 --> 02:45.900
Come on, blend in?

02:45.933 --> 02:48.402
They're op names
are Bundy and Manson.

02:55.943 --> 02:58.445
What is it, your first car ride?

02:58.478 --> 03:01.749
Please, I worked for Uber
for six months before this.

03:04.484 --> 03:06.286
Almost got me there.

03:09.924 --> 03:11.759
Where are we at with Reese?

03:12.760 --> 03:14.428
Reese, you set?

03:14.461 --> 03:15.897
<i>Got a 20 on the target.</i>

03:15.930 --> 03:17.999
Southwest window.
Calm as toilet water.

03:18.032 --> 03:20.902
No idea the shit storm
about to come down on them.

03:21.803 --> 03:23.570
All right.

03:24.972 --> 03:26.540
Reese...

03:26.573 --> 03:28.241
<i>give Manson and Bundy the goods,</i>

03:28.275 --> 03:30.577
<i>then circle back
to your second position.</i>

03:30.610 --> 03:32.714
Keep it clear back there.

03:52.432 --> 03:54.301
<i>Camera check?</i>

03:55.737 --> 03:58.039
<i>Camera's on.</i>

03:58.072 --> 04:00.007
Copy.

04:01.408 --> 04:03.845
Why would you go hide
in a shithole?

04:03.878 --> 04:07.447
Because no one cares
about a cockroach in a dumpster.

04:14.021 --> 04:15.589
Ah.

04:29.904 --> 04:32.305
Bonne chance.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.475
That guy's weird.

05:00.935 --> 05:03.603
<i>All right, remember
those weapons are for show.</i>

05:03.637 --> 05:06.439
We have no legal backing here,
so no shots fired.

05:09.010 --> 05:10.477
<i>Grab the guy and get him out.</i>

05:10.510 --> 05:12.345
Quiet, safe and fast.

05:12.379 --> 05:13.780
Copy?

05:46.613 --> 05:48.481
Motherfucker.

05:51.551 --> 05:53.020
<i>Shots fired.</i>

05:59.693 --> 06:01.528
- What was that?
- <i>We had an explosion.</i>

06:01.561 --> 06:03.164
Bundy, Manson, status?

06:05.099 --> 06:06.700
Bundy, Manson,
what's you status?

06:12.139 --> 06:13.941
Manson, report.
We're blind here.

06:15.809 --> 06:17.544
Manson, report!

06:19.579 --> 06:21.481
Stand down and get
the hell out of there.

06:21.514 --> 06:23.850
He tossed his feed.
We just saw it.

06:23.885 --> 06:25.528
All right, meet me
at the extraction point.

06:25.552 --> 06:26.786
Yeah.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.655
Shit!

06:34.061 --> 06:35.897
You and your traps.

06:35.930 --> 06:38.465
I know you got
no friends anymore.

06:42.802 --> 06:44.972
But, man,
it was easy to find you.

06:47.208 --> 06:48.943
We had to come.

06:49.709 --> 06:51.578
You knew that.

06:55.782 --> 06:58.986
Rookies outside weren't supposed
to be around for the kill.

06:59.020 --> 07:01.421
She's going to
be pissed about that.

07:15.236 --> 07:17.904
<i>Second explosion!</i>

07:27.181 --> 07:28.648
They didn't deserve to die.

07:30.985 --> 07:32.019
You do.

07:36.290 --> 07:38.192
I think that
welcoming committee's us.

07:38.225 --> 07:40.227
We're not done
here yet, man. Come on.

08:03.050 --> 08:05.685
<i>Forty-five seconds, boys.</i>

08:08.688 --> 08:11.658
Hey! Hands behind your back!
Hands behind your back! Come on!

08:13.827 --> 08:15.029
- No, no, no, no.
- Secure him.

08:15.062 --> 08:16.230
This is wrong, man.

08:16.263 --> 08:17.831
No, this is all wrong.

08:17.864 --> 08:19.033
Come on, come on, do it.

08:26.573 --> 08:27.874
Miller, we're heading down now.

08:30.244 --> 08:32.113
Let's go.

08:48.828 --> 08:50.964
Come on.

08:57.771 --> 08:58.938
Okay, yeah.

09:33.374 --> 09:35.276
Who are you?

09:40.680 --> 09:44.050
Omar, my name is Bill.

09:44.085 --> 09:47.787
And there's only one path
that leads you out of this very,

09:47.821 --> 09:50.224
very uncomfortable situation.

09:50.257 --> 09:53.260
I dearly hope you'll take it.

09:54.060 --> 09:55.662
Where am I?

09:56.996 --> 09:58.898
What do you want?

09:58.932 --> 10:01.901
I just want you to answer
questions honestly, that's it.

10:01.935 --> 10:05.172
That's all you have to do.
That's all.

10:05.206 --> 10:07.874
So let's start
with a simple one.

10:07.907 --> 10:12.011
Are you a member of
the Crescent Democratic Front?

10:12.045 --> 10:14.647
Listen, I have
asylum in the West.

10:14.681 --> 10:17.016
- Yeah.
- Me and my wife both do.

10:17.050 --> 10:18.885
- Okay?
- Yeah.

10:18.918 --> 10:20.653
I was on my way
to London to meet her

10:20.687 --> 10:22.432
- when you kidnapped me.
- I understand all that,

10:22.456 --> 10:24.057
but you didn't
answer my question.

10:24.090 --> 10:26.360
Are you a member of the CDF?

10:26.393 --> 10:28.061
It's your group,
your organization.

10:28.094 --> 10:29.296
You run it?

10:29.330 --> 10:31.097
- Yes!
- Yes. Okay.

10:31.132 --> 10:34.667
See, the publicly stated
goals of the CDF

10:34.701 --> 10:37.371
are to oust the dictator
Bandar El-Mizdawi,

10:37.404 --> 10:39.038
which is great.

10:39.072 --> 10:41.107
I'm all for ousting dictators.

10:41.142 --> 10:43.018
Exactly, that...
That is what we're trying to do.

10:43.042 --> 10:45.778
Good, I like that. Here's where
you run into difficulty.

10:46.779 --> 10:49.916
So tell me something.

10:49.949 --> 10:53.254
Do you know these men?

11:00.727 --> 11:02.095
No!

11:02.128 --> 11:03.963
Because the CDF
claims to be a charity.

11:03.997 --> 11:06.833
It's purely altruistic,
all right?

11:06.866 --> 11:10.003
But we have Intel
that shows that you received

11:10.036 --> 11:13.006
more than $2 million in
donations recently from these...

11:13.039 --> 11:15.276
These extremists.
That's what they are.

11:15.309 --> 11:17.844
They never uttered the word
"charity" in their lives.

11:17.877 --> 11:20.190
- I don't know these men!
- Well, I'll tell you about them.

11:20.214 --> 11:22.982
They only associate
with terrorists.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.918
So you can understand
our concern

11:24.951 --> 11:28.455
about you and your operation.

11:28.489 --> 11:30.123
You understand
why I'd want to know

11:30.156 --> 11:31.791
why they got involved
in the financing.

11:31.824 --> 11:33.726
They're not financing
my operation.

11:33.760 --> 11:35.229
What are you talking about?

11:35.262 --> 11:37.264
You making up lies?

11:37.298 --> 11:40.301
We are funded
by legitimate backers.

11:40.334 --> 11:41.502
Mm-hmm.

11:41.535 --> 11:43.504
People who want to bring peace.

11:43.537 --> 11:45.838
I understand that.
That's absolutely true.

11:45.872 --> 11:48.041
Up until recently, but now,

11:48.074 --> 11:50.843
the bank statements say
that things have changed.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.745
- No, no, no.
- Omar...

11:52.779 --> 11:54.457
- That's not true.
- I want to believe you,

11:54.481 --> 11:55.815
but you got to help me.

11:55.848 --> 11:57.016
You got to give me something.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.419
What are we supposed to think?

11:58.452 --> 12:00.454
The United States
and its allies, we...

12:00.487 --> 12:02.223
Traditionally,
we've granted asylum

12:02.256 --> 12:05.792
to individuals
who've formed groups

12:05.825 --> 12:08.027
that are seemingly
in line with our values.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.463
But sometimes...

12:09.496 --> 12:12.966
sometimes, Omar, those groups...

12:12.999 --> 12:14.401
well, they're taking advantage

12:14.435 --> 12:16.035
of the privilege
that we offer them,

12:16.069 --> 12:17.804
and they change their motives.

12:17.837 --> 12:22.243
And sometimes they had
different motives all along.

12:22.276 --> 12:23.977
Sometimes there are terrorists,

12:24.010 --> 12:25.788
and they wanted to work
against the governments

12:25.812 --> 12:27.823
- that were trying to help them.
- No, we are not terrorists.

12:27.847 --> 12:29.526
You're right. You know what?
The word "terrorist,"

12:29.550 --> 12:30.950
it's a... It's a label.

12:30.984 --> 12:33.152
- Maybe you are.
- Maybe I am.

12:33.186 --> 12:35.021
It's a question
of perspective, right?

12:35.054 --> 12:38.492
So from my perspective,
my government's perspective,

12:38.525 --> 12:41.528
you must understand,
we have to know...

12:43.330 --> 12:45.231
how these dangerous men
came to be involved

12:45.266 --> 12:46.367
with your group.

12:46.400 --> 12:47.934
Why?

12:47.967 --> 12:49.802
What did they want?

12:49.836 --> 12:51.548
- I don't know these people!
- When I walked in the room

12:51.572 --> 12:54.941
I said there's only one way
out of this for you,

12:54.974 --> 12:56.876
and that's to help me.

12:56.909 --> 12:58.579
So far, you've given me nothing.

12:58.612 --> 13:00.980
I don't know them. How many
times am I telling you this?

13:01.014 --> 13:02.516
Now you know why we're here.

13:02.549 --> 13:04.351
Understand what
we have to talk about.

13:04.385 --> 13:06.152
- I have an asylum.
- So you think about it.

13:06.185 --> 13:08.054
- Hey!
- All right, Omar.

13:08.087 --> 13:09.989
Hey, come on, man. You can't...

13:10.023 --> 13:11.824
You cannot do this to me.

13:11.858 --> 13:13.470
I'm going to give you
a little time to think about it.

13:13.494 --> 13:15.596
- Think about what?
- To look at the pictures.

13:15.629 --> 13:17.864
See if maybe it
triggers off some memories.

13:17.897 --> 13:19.566
What?

13:19.600 --> 13:21.302
I don't know these men!

13:21.335 --> 13:23.236
- I'll see you soon.
- Hey!

13:23.269 --> 13:25.439
I don't know these men!

13:28.509 --> 13:30.043
Now what?

13:30.076 --> 13:32.211
Now we let him think.

13:32.245 --> 13:34.280
We don't have time
to let him think.

13:34.315 --> 13:37.250
Our orders are to extract
Intel that is time-sensitive

13:37.283 --> 13:39.052
to our people
in the field today.

13:39.085 --> 13:40.953
They're my orders.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.489
Harris, what you got?

13:42.523 --> 13:44.023
Well, I checked him out.

13:44.057 --> 13:45.426
All his papers
are the real deal.

13:45.459 --> 13:47.193
He's both U.S. and U.K. backed.

13:47.226 --> 13:49.962
This group comes over here
telling us what we want to hear,

13:49.996 --> 13:52.165
and then they
start working on undermining.

13:52.198 --> 13:53.467
Western civilization.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.935
You could tone down
the hyperbole.

13:55.968 --> 13:59.340
I'm just saying, like,
we can make quick work of this.

13:59.373 --> 14:01.375
What are they
teaching you nowadays?

14:01.408 --> 14:05.346
We're here to get the truth,
not force faulty Intel.

14:08.449 --> 14:10.983
Bill's been doing this
a long time.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.386
Yeah, I don't get it.

14:12.419 --> 14:14.053
You don't need to get it.

14:14.087 --> 14:15.988
We know what we're doing.

14:16.022 --> 14:18.024
Why don't you
just sit back and learn.

14:22.095 --> 14:23.664
May I give it a go?
I have an idea.

14:23.697 --> 14:26.265
Gentle, direct.

14:28.234 --> 14:30.537
A slightly different
angle than yours.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.874
Now we're talking.

14:45.519 --> 14:47.654
- We got to ditch the car.
- Negative.

14:47.688 --> 14:49.690
- Negative to what part?
- Negative all around.

14:49.723 --> 14:52.125
Those cops clocked our
faces and the vehicle.

14:52.158 --> 14:54.395
They may be French,
but they can't be that stupid.

14:54.428 --> 14:56.463
I knew something was wrong.
I knew it!

14:56.497 --> 14:58.164
That guy knew we were coming.

14:58.197 --> 15:00.199
I'm telling you
we have to ditch the car.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.144
If the target knew we were
coming, he might have friends.

15:02.168 --> 15:06.038
The best move is to move faster.
Take us straight to the plane.

15:06.072 --> 15:08.409
You need to let control know
that we're going to be early.

15:08.442 --> 15:10.444
You need to just drive.

15:12.011 --> 15:13.346
You see this?

15:13.379 --> 15:15.314
- Right here, 5:00.
- Shit.

15:15.348 --> 15:17.518
There's a Mark on your 5:00.

15:33.366 --> 15:36.068
All right, no communication
until we get to the plane.

15:36.102 --> 15:38.639
We don't want to risk
anything getting intercepted.

15:38.672 --> 15:40.617
If he knew we were coming,
why did he stick around,

15:40.641 --> 15:43.109
then pick a fight,
then surrender to us?

15:43.142 --> 15:45.044
We have the target,
we're on course.

15:45.077 --> 15:47.146
One step at a time.

15:58.090 --> 15:59.460
Here, sit down.

15:59.493 --> 16:01.360
Make yourself comfortable.

16:02.361 --> 16:04.330
Is this your office?

16:06.500 --> 16:08.635
No, no, this is just
where we meet the new recruits.

16:08.669 --> 16:11.538
My place, not nearly
as cushy as this.

16:11.572 --> 16:13.774
Aren't there usually
cameras in these meetings?

16:13.807 --> 16:17.711
Oh, yeah, but we have
plenty of tape on you.

16:20.112 --> 16:22.148
Yeah, exactly.

16:22.181 --> 16:23.684
Hey, why'd you call me in now?

16:23.717 --> 16:26.118
You've denied my application
five times in a row.

16:26.152 --> 16:28.187
You've... I haven't
declined anything.

16:28.221 --> 16:29.355
Oh, my God.

16:29.388 --> 16:31.625
The Collective Agency, you.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.760
Oh, okay, well,
I could see why that might be

16:33.794 --> 16:36.597
a little confusing
for you, um...

16:40.266 --> 16:42.769
Your D.O.D. file says you really
crashed and burned there,

16:42.803 --> 16:44.805
and that's why
they've rejected you here.

16:49.308 --> 16:52.579
Look I didn't have time
to crash and burn, all right?

16:52.613 --> 16:56.048
I was sent home immediately.
I have no idea why.

16:56.082 --> 16:59.485
Yeah, I can see
you're upset by that.

17:00.721 --> 17:02.623
I can't say it felt good.

17:02.656 --> 17:05.391
No, I can imagine
I really don't get it.

17:05.424 --> 17:08.394
You're smart, RotC, two tours.

17:08.427 --> 17:11.230
Completed your service.

17:11.264 --> 17:14.200
Only to wash out
after a month at D.O.D.

17:14.233 --> 17:15.769
Right.

17:18.304 --> 17:20.439
Definitely not ideal.

17:23.509 --> 17:26.145
And since then, you've been
working in the private sector.

17:26.178 --> 17:28.582
Why don't you tell me
about that.

17:30.884 --> 17:32.451
Uh...

17:32.485 --> 17:36.322
it was a couple stints overseas,
you know?

17:36.355 --> 17:38.157
And, yeah, mainly security.

17:39.760 --> 17:41.360
Looking after the fat kid,

17:41.394 --> 17:44.130
wondering what's under
mama's yashmak.

17:45.632 --> 17:47.166
Well...

17:48.401 --> 17:50.136
You ever been team leader?

17:52.505 --> 17:55.709
Uh, what?

17:55.742 --> 17:58.544
What would you say if I told you
to apply one more time?

18:00.914 --> 18:03.316
Lucky number six.

18:13.459 --> 18:15.161
It's okay.

18:18.699 --> 18:20.333
Here.

18:26.940 --> 18:28.809
Where am I?

18:30.476 --> 18:33.279
This is called a Black Site.

18:33.312 --> 18:35.281
Nobody knows it's here.

18:38.619 --> 18:40.787
Is my wife okay?

18:40.821 --> 18:42.656
I'm sorry.

18:42.689 --> 18:45.157
I'm just a foot soldier.
They don't tell me anything.

18:47.360 --> 18:50.329
I'm not even supposed
to be in here right now.

18:50.363 --> 18:52.799
I was worried about you.

18:55.234 --> 18:58.270
I don't have much to offer,
but I'm not your enemy.

18:59.740 --> 19:01.540
Drink.

19:02.676 --> 19:04.377
You have to.

19:07.380 --> 19:09.348
Little more.

19:09.382 --> 19:12.184
<i>You know the others here,
they're not like me.</i>

19:18.725 --> 19:21.762
Can you please find out
about my wife?

19:23.730 --> 19:25.197
What's her name?

19:25.231 --> 19:26.667
Fatima.

19:28.669 --> 19:30.804
That's a lovely name.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.573
I'll see what I can do.

19:34.607 --> 19:36.375
Thank you.

19:47.486 --> 19:49.588
Well, not how
I would have started.

19:49.622 --> 19:51.792
Not bad, right?

19:59.498 --> 20:01.902
You can't just waltz in
through the front gate.

20:01.935 --> 20:04.637
I thought it was supposed
to be our people on there.

20:04.670 --> 20:06.272
Supposed to be.

20:06.873 --> 20:08.775
Christ.

20:28.494 --> 20:30.931
Holy shit, who hired
Nance and Rand to fly the plane?

20:31.998 --> 20:34.300
Wait, wait, hit the brights.

20:36.770 --> 20:38.504
Go, go!

20:38.537 --> 20:39.873
Hands behind your head.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.607
- What the...?
- Behind your head!

20:41.640 --> 20:42.985
- Do it! Don't move!
- Turn around!

20:43.009 --> 20:44.745
- Hey!
- Don't move!

20:44.778 --> 20:46.512
All right, pat them down.

20:48.514 --> 20:49.992
- Clear.
- All right, keep them covered.

20:50.016 --> 20:51.818
- Keep an eye out.
- Copy.

21:46.072 --> 21:47.673
All right.

21:47.706 --> 21:49.341
Don't move.

21:49.375 --> 21:51.510
All right, we're clear.

21:53.980 --> 21:55.748
Let me see.

21:55.781 --> 21:57.559
What the hell is this, man?
We're just the pilots.

21:57.583 --> 21:59.061
We pick you up and drop you off.
That's it.

21:59.085 --> 22:01.554
Hey, just relax, Pops.
It's for the Gramp.

22:01.587 --> 22:03.431
Right, turn around.
It's all right. It's all right.

22:03.455 --> 22:05.457
Aren't there supposed
to be more of you?

22:09.595 --> 22:11.430
Are we good?

22:11.463 --> 22:13.867
They're good. Get us prepped.
We need to move fast.

22:13.900 --> 22:15.568
I'm grabbing our guy.

22:20.706 --> 22:23.109
Hey, wake up, sleepyhead.

22:23.143 --> 22:25.811
Let's go. Hey, get up.

22:26.645 --> 22:28.081
This way.

22:33.086 --> 22:35.387
Step.

22:40.093 --> 22:41.827
Hey, Miller, check your line.

22:42.761 --> 22:44.597
We're good!

23:06.452 --> 23:07.988
What about the wife?

23:08.021 --> 23:11.024
He gave me her name.
We pick her up, we use her.

23:11.057 --> 23:13.726
We've just abducted
one possibly innocent man.

23:13.759 --> 23:16.629
We're definitely
not taking his wife.

23:21.500 --> 23:23.702
He's hitting a wall.

23:23.736 --> 23:26.206
Bill is not hitting a wall.

23:26.239 --> 23:28.074
We kidnap people
and transport them

23:28.108 --> 23:29.986
to other countries
willing to look the other way

23:30.010 --> 23:31.844
while we interrogate them.

23:31.877 --> 23:34.747
But we do that
with the flag on our back.

23:34.780 --> 23:37.483
It's a dangerous grey area
to do business in,

23:37.516 --> 23:40.753
but we have to be careful
about drawing a moral line.

23:46.059 --> 23:48.861
Orders are the only line.

23:53.832 --> 23:55.601
All right, little buddy.

23:55.634 --> 23:57.237
Let's get you all
strapped in here.

23:57.270 --> 23:59.738
That's nice. Now you can't move.

24:02.541 --> 24:04.044
Going to get
your little feeties.

24:04.077 --> 24:05.678
There you go, there.

24:05.711 --> 24:08.580
If you need to go potty,
just wiggle around.

24:10.150 --> 24:11.550
That's good.

24:13.119 --> 24:15.088
Now you can relax.

24:17.556 --> 24:18.791
Target's secure.

24:18.824 --> 24:20.859
All right,
get us up and running.

24:20.893 --> 24:24.730
- I want updates in flight.
- We're good to go.

24:24.763 --> 24:26.266
Estimate 11 hours until landing.

24:26.299 --> 24:28.134
This is all weird.

24:28.168 --> 24:31.972
Yeah, somebody is
really aching for this guy.

24:32.005 --> 24:33.806
Yep.

24:35.041 --> 24:36.942
Call me crazy,
but wouldn't this job be

24:36.977 --> 24:39.297
a hell of a lot easier if we
actually had some information?

24:41.613 --> 24:44.250
Well, you know the drill.

24:44.284 --> 24:46.919
The more we know,
the more we're accountable to.

24:46.952 --> 24:49.065
No, I don't know the drill,
but the more I learn about it

24:49.089 --> 24:50.756
the more I don't like it.

24:54.227 --> 24:56.129
Well, you get
too much back-story,

24:56.162 --> 24:59.032
and suddenly maybe we start
deciding for ourselves.

25:00.133 --> 25:02.235
The difference
between right and wrong.

25:03.669 --> 25:06.139
It makes it hard for us
just to follow orders.

25:30.363 --> 25:32.731
Oh.

25:37.337 --> 25:39.938
I never met
a pageant winner before.

25:41.341 --> 25:43.575
Who have you met?

25:43.609 --> 25:44.977
Oh, all kinds of people.

25:45.010 --> 25:47.646
Criminals, drug dealers,
the odd despot.

25:48.747 --> 25:50.083
No...

25:51.884 --> 25:54.653
You're not the usual fish,
are you?

25:54.686 --> 26:00.193
You're like a slice of
American pie without the apples.

26:04.930 --> 26:07.900
What are you getting at?

26:07.933 --> 26:10.270
You go to a top college
and you drop out.

26:10.303 --> 26:11.870
I don't get it.

26:11.904 --> 26:14.274
Mm-hmm. I went back.

26:14.307 --> 26:16.675
You went back?

26:18.144 --> 26:22.881
Magna cum laude
is more than just going back.

26:24.250 --> 26:27.353
But then you drop out
a second time,

26:27.387 --> 26:28.921
right at the end of law school.

26:28.954 --> 26:30.589
What gives?

26:35.228 --> 26:37.796
I think you already
know the answer to that.

26:37.830 --> 26:40.766
Did it have something to do with
that classmate's ass you kicked

26:40.799 --> 26:42.668
and put him in the hospital?

26:42.701 --> 26:44.170
You mean my professor?

26:44.204 --> 26:46.738
Professor? Ah, that's good.

26:46.772 --> 26:49.142
He must have really
given you a bad grade.

26:49.175 --> 26:50.709
I gave him a black eye.

26:51.944 --> 26:53.078
He gave you a black Mark.

26:53.113 --> 26:55.047
So pretty good.

26:55.080 --> 26:56.316
Hmm.

26:56.349 --> 26:59.751
I see that's sort of behavior

26:59.785 --> 27:03.755
as an advantage for you and me,
quite frankly in us.

27:05.191 --> 27:07.025
Most people would hardly
consider a temper

27:07.059 --> 27:10.363
and difficulty forming
relationships an advantage.

27:10.396 --> 27:16.768
Well, we are big believers
in practical application here.

27:16.802 --> 27:18.670
I don't know what practical
application means.

27:18.704 --> 27:21.374
Good, keep it that way.

27:21.407 --> 27:23.876
You're a very
well-tabernacled spirit.

27:25.378 --> 27:27.189
See, if I figure if we
put you in the right place

27:27.213 --> 27:29.215
and the right circumstances,

27:29.249 --> 27:31.184
it could be advantageous
to everyone,

27:31.217 --> 27:33.018
including your country.

27:36.356 --> 27:37.756
Hmm.

27:37.789 --> 27:39.292
Tell me more.

27:44.164 --> 27:46.432
<i>The clock is ticking on Omar.</i>

27:46.466 --> 27:49.369
Well, sir, he insists
he's never met the targets,

27:49.402 --> 27:51.471
and he's adamant
that the CDF exists

27:51.504 --> 27:54.039
only to resist El-Mizdawi.

27:54.072 --> 27:56.708
If there's no Intel
to be gained...

27:58.010 --> 28:00.012
move on to the next phase.

28:00.045 --> 28:02.315
Well, where's the
Intel come from, sir?

28:02.348 --> 28:05.318
It's... It's wafer thin.
It's a couple of documents.

28:05.351 --> 28:07.420
<i>You got to go in
and bring home the bacon.</i>

28:07.453 --> 28:11.089
I understand, but no...
With respect, sir...

28:11.123 --> 28:12.958
- <i>Do it.</i>
- I...

28:12.991 --> 28:15.361
Sounds like we're on
the same page.

28:15.395 --> 28:17.197
Yeah, copy that, sir.

28:17.230 --> 28:18.797
Shut the door.

28:21.367 --> 28:23.835
They're pushing us.
They're pushing us on this guy.

28:23.869 --> 28:28.441
And there's... There's something
they're not telling us.

28:28.474 --> 28:30.776
Well, it's not the first time.

28:30.809 --> 28:32.778
I don't think
Omar's met those men.

28:32.811 --> 28:34.347
I don't think even
if they find us,

28:34.380 --> 28:38.183
then the CDF has
any idea, do you?

28:38.218 --> 28:40.118
Well, what about the wife?

28:43.088 --> 28:44.890
Oh, shut the...

28:46.259 --> 28:47.993
Visser had surveillance on her?

28:48.860 --> 28:50.396
Yeah.

28:51.997 --> 28:53.499
Fine.

28:53.533 --> 28:55.934
Let's use the wife,
let's amp up the dramatics.

28:58.471 --> 29:00.540
Hey, Harris...

29:00.573 --> 29:03.509
whatever they end up
telling us on this,

29:03.543 --> 29:06.412
you help me keep
my head straight.

29:07.380 --> 29:09.147
All right?

29:09.181 --> 29:11.451
Never seen you call one wrong.

29:12.818 --> 29:14.820
Funny.

29:29.435 --> 29:32.472
Hey, you stressed?

29:35.541 --> 29:37.377
No, no, no, no,
it's pretty standard.

29:38.844 --> 29:40.413
Way to pop my cherry.

29:42.448 --> 29:45.250
Are you seriously telling me
this is your first time?

29:47.252 --> 29:49.289
Yeah, man, we're getting
to know each other here.

29:49.322 --> 29:51.324
Let me get in here.

29:51.357 --> 29:54.159
Kavinsky,
you're a Marine, right?

29:54.192 --> 29:55.994
When I was behind you
on that staircase,

29:56.028 --> 29:58.039
I thought: That's Kavinsky,
he's got to be a Marine.

29:58.063 --> 30:02.568
Either that or, I don't know,
Polish fitness influencer.

30:02.602 --> 30:04.404
Now look at you.

30:04.437 --> 30:06.472
- Yeah, what about you.
- Huh?

30:06.506 --> 30:08.073
You're too dumb to be Air Force,

30:08.106 --> 30:09.941
you don't complain
enough to be Navy,

30:09.975 --> 30:12.412
but you're too pretty
to be Army.

30:12.445 --> 30:14.079
Maybe he's Coast Guard.

30:14.112 --> 30:16.248
Royal Canadian
Coast Guard, actually.

30:16.281 --> 30:20.018
Just a boot rec.
Well, spent some time in Warsaw.

30:21.053 --> 30:22.888
Hmm. Agency after?

30:22.921 --> 30:26.258
Yeah, I bounced around
a little bit.

30:26.291 --> 30:27.993
What bounced around?
Bounced around where?

30:28.026 --> 30:29.595
Typical shitbag stuff.

30:29.629 --> 30:32.565
Developed some bad habits
in the Stan countries.

30:33.899 --> 30:35.967
Yeah, I guess we all did.

30:36.001 --> 30:38.471
Yeah, but I guess the agency
likes some of my bad habits,

30:38.504 --> 30:41.541
because here I am. It's good
to be back in the game again.

30:44.477 --> 30:46.612
How about you?
How long you been a company man?

30:49.649 --> 30:52.184
Well, come on now.
Give me something.

30:52.217 --> 30:54.587
Be good to know something about
a guy I'm in the shit with.

30:55.588 --> 30:57.457
It's a recent development.

30:57.490 --> 30:59.057
Really?

30:59.091 --> 31:00.660
I'd have pegged you
for a salty dog.

31:00.693 --> 31:02.894
I always wanted into the agency,

31:02.928 --> 31:05.398
but I guess it took a minute or
two to line things up and all.

31:05.431 --> 31:08.967
I hear that.
It's a tough career choice.

31:11.504 --> 31:14.306
Oh, hi, Poindexter.
Tell us about yourself, babe.

31:14.339 --> 31:15.907
How'd you end up here?

31:15.941 --> 31:18.478
When it comes to passing
and failing a test,

31:18.511 --> 31:20.312
I'm a loose Cannon.

31:20.345 --> 31:22.948
Give me life or death,
and I'm surprisingly cool.

31:22.981 --> 31:26.218
But overall, I'm bored.

31:27.687 --> 31:29.389
She's a dream recruit.

31:29.422 --> 31:33.925
Well, look at us,
knucklehead, jarhead, baghead,

31:33.959 --> 31:36.294
and a surprisingly cool head.

31:37.195 --> 31:38.930
We're a ragtag bunch.

31:38.964 --> 31:40.633
But this is good.

31:40.666 --> 31:43.935
Getting to know each other.
I'm feeling safer already.

31:43.969 --> 31:46.572
Well, as long as you feel good,
that's all that matters, right?

31:46.606 --> 31:49.675
You guys hungry?
I saw some almonds back there.

31:49.709 --> 31:52.177
I'm going to get some almonds.
You want some?

32:02.522 --> 32:04.322
What do you want?

32:06.091 --> 32:09.595
Omar, we've reached
a point now where...

32:09.629 --> 32:12.097
we're going to have
to escalate things.

32:13.398 --> 32:15.167
So I'm going to ask you
one last time,

32:15.200 --> 32:19.672
why are these men
involved with CDF?

32:19.705 --> 32:22.040
For the hundredth time,
they are not!

32:23.509 --> 32:25.076
Okay.

32:39.559 --> 32:41.092
I'll kill you!

32:44.429 --> 32:46.398
These were taken
about an hour ago.

32:46.431 --> 32:49.134
- What do you want from her?
- Omar, she's terrified.

32:49.167 --> 32:50.703
She probably thinks you're dead.

32:50.736 --> 32:53.338
Just let her go, man.
What do you want?

32:53.371 --> 32:55.617
To be honest, I don't know when
you're going to see her again,

32:55.641 --> 32:57.710
- because we got to bring her in.
- For what?

32:57.743 --> 32:59.444
She haven't done anything.

32:59.479 --> 33:02.280
She's the only lead we have
apart from you.

33:02.314 --> 33:05.450
I told you everything.
What do you want from me?

33:08.453 --> 33:09.755
Ghuma Nasuf.

33:09.789 --> 33:11.256
He was granted asylum
in the West,

33:11.289 --> 33:12.758
just like you five years ago.

33:12.792 --> 33:15.260
He disappears,
he reappears five years later

33:15.293 --> 33:17.395
spreading anti-American
propaganda around mosques.

33:17.429 --> 33:20.566
He's radicalizing young kids

33:20.600 --> 33:22.502
to kill Jews, kill Christians.

33:22.535 --> 33:24.804
Then arrest him.
What do you want from my wife?

33:24.837 --> 33:26.672
This guy...

33:26.706 --> 33:28.584
this guy could have worked
for any of the big four.

33:28.608 --> 33:31.644
Instead he chooses
to run finances for Al-Qaeda

33:31.677 --> 33:33.311
and Chechen rebels.

33:33.345 --> 33:36.448
And now he's got his
fingers in the CDF.

33:36.481 --> 33:38.083
Why?

33:40.720 --> 33:43.589
These men and I may have
a hundred things in common,

33:43.623 --> 33:46.424
but we're not the same.

33:46.458 --> 33:48.126
My goal is, and always will be,

33:48.159 --> 33:50.395
to rid of El-Mizdawi
from our country.

33:50.428 --> 33:52.297
Just because you're American

33:52.330 --> 33:55.701
doesn't mean your colleagues
share the same goal as you.

33:57.235 --> 34:00.305
I am a patriot. Are you?

34:09.514 --> 34:11.082
Shit.

34:14.452 --> 34:17.455
All right, look, Omar,

34:17.489 --> 34:18.824
I like what you say in public.

34:18.858 --> 34:20.458
I admire you.

34:20.492 --> 34:22.527
I watch your speeches.
We both have.

34:23.829 --> 34:25.831
I think you're a brave man.

34:25.865 --> 34:28.601
Here's what I think happened.
I think they tricked you.

34:30.135 --> 34:31.837
I think they lied to you...

34:33.606 --> 34:37.175
and I think that once they put
that much money into your group,

34:37.208 --> 34:39.745
you don't think
you can back out.

34:39.779 --> 34:42.648
But I'm telling you,
you can't trust them.

34:44.617 --> 34:46.451
Then why you trust
this bullshit?

34:53.893 --> 34:55.393
Maybe you are a patriot.

34:55.427 --> 34:57.897
Maybe, all you want is to topple

34:57.930 --> 34:59.599
a dictator's oppression
of your people.

34:59.632 --> 35:02.233
But unless you can prove to me

35:02.267 --> 35:04.737
that these people
are not involved with CDF

35:04.770 --> 35:07.405
or that you don't know
what they're planning,

35:07.439 --> 35:10.676
then you're guilty
by association.

35:13.178 --> 35:14.880
And so is your wife.

35:41.239 --> 35:43.308
It was the right move.
He'll buckle.

35:44.409 --> 35:45.711
He's telling the truth.

35:45.745 --> 35:47.379
What? How do you know?

35:47.412 --> 35:49.614
Because I know.
Because it's my job to know.

35:49.649 --> 35:50.959
Because I've been doing
it for 30 years

35:50.983 --> 35:52.617
since you were in diapers.

35:52.652 --> 35:54.352
Yeah, and we don't do it
like that anymore.

35:54.386 --> 35:55.921
We got to get him
out of here, Harris.

35:55.955 --> 35:57.723
- I know, I know.
- No, no, no, no. I...

35:57.757 --> 35:59.892
Are you actually...?
Can you handle this?

35:59.925 --> 36:01.292
- Get her out.
- Visser,

36:01.326 --> 36:02.895
give us the room please.

36:14.907 --> 36:18.410
What are we doing?
What the fuck are we doing?

36:18.443 --> 36:20.746
Well, he will recover.

36:20.780 --> 36:23.883
Though it's done worse.

36:24.917 --> 36:26.786
Yeah.

36:28.286 --> 36:29.654
I want you to dig.

36:29.689 --> 36:31.589
Keep it all quiet,
backdoor info.

36:31.623 --> 36:33.793
I want to know why
they really want this guy.

36:33.826 --> 36:36.227
There's a reason info
like that's compartmentalized.

36:36.261 --> 36:38.698
Once you know it,
you're responsible for it.

36:38.731 --> 36:40.432
Yeah, well, I'm done.

36:40.465 --> 36:42.735
It's not working for me anymore.

36:44.269 --> 36:46.337
I know a few guys
closer to the field.

36:46.371 --> 36:48.406
Spend a lot of time in the gray.

36:48.440 --> 36:49.742
They won't bullshit me.

36:49.775 --> 36:51.409
Thanks.

36:54.312 --> 36:55.915
Shit.

38:08.586 --> 38:12.057
- You get any updates?
- No.

38:12.091 --> 38:14.794
It was just, uh...
It's radio silence.

38:15.493 --> 38:16.896
Copy you.

38:20.065 --> 38:21.967
You guys seen
any water around here?

38:22.001 --> 38:24.369
Sink in the back.

38:37.149 --> 38:39.450
<i>Bill's a true believer.</i>

38:39.484 --> 38:40.920
He's served his country well,

38:40.953 --> 38:43.122
and he'll continue
to serve his country.

38:43.155 --> 38:45.590
It's what he signed up to do.

38:46.491 --> 38:48.393
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

38:48.426 --> 38:51.796
Our mission is to keep
the wars small...

38:52.797 --> 38:54.632
the sacrifices meaningful...

38:56.534 --> 38:58.670
and the story out of the news.

39:00.705 --> 39:02.640
We're officially
in clean-up mode.

39:02.674 --> 39:03.808
Clear?

39:03.843 --> 39:05.677
Clear, sir.

39:07.445 --> 39:09.547
You know what's required, yes?

39:11.416 --> 39:12.852
Yes, sir.

39:15.187 --> 39:17.422
You were right. It's a mess.

39:17.455 --> 39:19.490
There has been a major shift.

39:19.524 --> 39:21.793
We're getting in bed
with El-Mizdawi.

39:21.826 --> 39:23.896
The guy we've been trying
to get rid of for years?

39:23.929 --> 39:25.396
- Yeah.
- Literally five years

39:25.430 --> 39:27.032
in shitholes like this?

39:27.066 --> 39:29.044
This is a letter from
El-Mizdawi's intelligence chief

39:29.068 --> 39:31.436
sent to our station in Qatar.

39:31.469 --> 39:33.404
Intercepted by the French,

39:33.438 --> 39:35.007
got in the hands of
my men on the ground

39:35.040 --> 39:36.674
who made friends in the Riviera.

39:36.708 --> 39:38.086
They're making a deal
with this piece of shit.

39:38.110 --> 39:40.678
El-Mizdawi hates
Al-Qaeda so much,

39:40.712 --> 39:43.648
he's allowing us access to his
resources to help hunt him down.

39:43.681 --> 39:44.984
Nice guy.

39:45.017 --> 39:46.886
Yeah, and as a gesture
of good faith,

39:46.919 --> 39:49.787
what do you think our new
best friend is asking in return?

39:49.821 --> 39:51.556
Round up his enemies,

39:51.589 --> 39:52.934
people who've been
trying to oust him.

39:52.958 --> 39:54.425
- Yeah.
- We've been protecting,

39:54.459 --> 39:55.793
we send them back.

39:55.827 --> 39:57.762
And a week after
the deal was made,

39:57.795 --> 39:59.831
we get orders to pick up Omar.

39:59.864 --> 40:01.866
He's a fucking sacrifice.

40:04.003 --> 40:06.604
And see if you can
find a pillow for me.

40:08.073 --> 40:09.909
Power napping.

40:13.979 --> 40:15.480
Here you go, sweetheart.

40:15.513 --> 40:17.216
- Hey.
- Here, keep yourself warm too.

40:17.249 --> 40:19.884
Look at this, first class.

40:25.224 --> 40:26.457
This ain't no blanket.

40:26.491 --> 40:27.927
What?

40:27.960 --> 40:29.094
This is a body bag.

40:29.128 --> 40:30.628
What the fuck?

40:30.662 --> 40:32.998
Kind of blanket
you don't take off.

40:33.032 --> 40:34.967
It was folded
in between the fucking pillows.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.212
- What's this doing out here?
- How I was supposed to know

40:37.236 --> 40:38.980
they were body bags?
They were neatly folded.

40:39.004 --> 40:40.648
- Thought you checked the plane.
- Fuck you!

40:40.672 --> 40:42.050
What are you
talking about, fuck me?

40:42.074 --> 40:43.775
I cleared the fucking plane!

40:43.808 --> 40:45.220
- Are you saying fuck me?
- Yeah, fuck you!

40:45.244 --> 40:46.844
I'm asking you why you gave me...

40:46.878 --> 40:48.913
- What the fuck was that?
- Oh, that's good.

40:48.948 --> 40:50.882
That's fucking great.

40:59.757 --> 41:03.228
Hey, guys, just give me
five minutes with him.

41:03.262 --> 41:05.930
- For what?
- He's worried about his wife.

41:05.965 --> 41:07.132
He thinks I'm sympathetic.

41:07.166 --> 41:08.933
I... I build on that story,

41:08.968 --> 41:11.469
it could be something
that puts us over the edge.

41:15.007 --> 41:17.675
Sure.

41:17.709 --> 41:20.079
Uh, we got, what... Uh, clothes?

41:20.112 --> 41:22.613
T-shirt? Something, anything.

41:22.647 --> 41:24.515
Yeah.

41:24.549 --> 41:26.918
I need this guy to think
that I'm going to let him

41:26.951 --> 41:28.653
walk out of here.

41:30.322 --> 41:32.224
I'll see what I can grab.

41:32.257 --> 41:36.694
Visser, just so you know,
after your little chat,

41:36.728 --> 41:38.297
I'm pulling the plug.

41:38.330 --> 41:40.598
I'll take whatever
Langley throws at me.

41:40.631 --> 41:41.866
Knock yourself out.

41:41.899 --> 41:43.868
Yes, sir.

41:52.610 --> 41:54.279
Why are we descending?

41:54.313 --> 41:56.614
- We're going down.
- What's happening?

41:56.647 --> 41:58.050
Hey! Hey!

41:58.083 --> 41:59.784
Good news is
we're coming down early.

41:59.817 --> 42:01.686
Bad news:
It's definitely a trap.

42:01.719 --> 42:03.088
Open the fucking door!

42:03.122 --> 42:04.856
Open the fucking door!

42:06.225 --> 42:07.725
Open the fucking door!

42:07.759 --> 42:10.295
Goddamn it!

42:10.329 --> 42:12.131
- Hey, bad idea.
- Fuck!

42:12.164 --> 42:13.798
Are you getting any chatter?

42:13.831 --> 42:16.968
I got nothing.

42:17.001 --> 42:19.271
Badder news, I thought
we were going to Thailand.

42:19.304 --> 42:21.906
I was going to get a massage
and a Tom gai soup.

42:21.939 --> 42:23.808
Nothing from Control.

42:23.841 --> 42:25.877
Shit, what do we do?

42:54.705 --> 42:56.741
You look awful.

43:07.286 --> 43:09.620
Right now she's got two minutes.

43:11.323 --> 43:14.093
Easy, easy.

43:20.865 --> 43:22.967
I'm going to lift
you up now, okay?

43:44.922 --> 43:46.891
I get to sit down...

43:48.293 --> 43:51.062
so now I have to be your friend?

43:52.364 --> 43:54.899
My colleagues
only want one thing.

43:54.932 --> 43:59.036
Give it to them,
and you get out of here.

43:59.070 --> 44:00.405
You're done.

44:05.244 --> 44:08.980
Whether you beat me or not,
the answer is the same.

44:12.917 --> 44:14.319
Okay, I believe you.

44:17.222 --> 44:19.358
I wish it didn't have
to come to this, but...

44:23.395 --> 44:25.397
in that case it's the
only way to get you out.

44:25.430 --> 44:27.399
To Fatima.

44:29.201 --> 44:31.336
Let's get you changed.

44:51.956 --> 44:53.824
Okay.

45:06.471 --> 45:07.972
Take it.

45:08.005 --> 45:10.475
It's the only way
to get you out.

45:10.509 --> 45:13.345
You don't let anybody stop you.
Go, come on.

45:16.013 --> 45:17.216
Take it.

45:17.249 --> 45:19.318
What is that?

45:21.986 --> 45:24.389
Jesus fuck! Stay here!

45:27.426 --> 45:29.060
Go.

45:51.483 --> 45:53.385
What the fuck did you do?

45:53.418 --> 45:56.020
I had to. He attacked me.

45:59.991 --> 46:01.460
Sit down.

46:01.493 --> 46:03.961
Sit the fuck down!

46:07.566 --> 46:09.166
Stay here.

46:19.143 --> 46:20.512
Fuck it.

46:20.545 --> 46:22.213
Hey, hey, wait,
what are you doing?

46:22.246 --> 46:24.215
- Getting answers!
- No!

46:24.248 --> 46:26.884
- Easy, easy.
- What the fuck are you doing?

46:26.917 --> 46:28.953
Don't you fucking move.

46:28.986 --> 46:31.088
Hey, team, good news.

46:31.122 --> 46:32.823
I found a half a bottle
of Tequila.

46:32.857 --> 46:34.335
Why don't we have a drink
and talk this over

46:34.359 --> 46:35.560
without the guns?

46:35.594 --> 46:37.194
What the fuck are you doing?

46:37.228 --> 46:38.996
You're not authorized
to talk to him.

46:39.030 --> 46:41.866
I have to. I have to.

46:41.899 --> 46:44.201
- No, you don't.
- He knew we were coming.

46:44.235 --> 46:45.836
He took down two of our guys,

46:45.870 --> 46:48.039
and Control's got
no answers for us.

46:48.072 --> 46:50.083
Now we're stuck in fucking box
with no idea where we're headed.

46:50.107 --> 46:51.610
You are not allowed
to talk to him.

46:51.643 --> 46:53.378
Can we break down
the walls here?

46:53.412 --> 46:55.314
I'm noticing a lot
of defensiveness

46:55.347 --> 46:57.014
that's coming through somehow.

46:57.048 --> 46:58.949
Maybe it's the guns,
I don't know what it is.

46:58.983 --> 47:00.994
But it's aggressive, and I don't
think it's constructive.

47:01.018 --> 47:03.422
We need to break through,
and get to the bottom of this.

47:03.455 --> 47:05.256
There's clearly
something wrong here.

47:05.289 --> 47:07.124
We're about to land
God knows fucking where.

47:07.158 --> 47:09.461
For all we know,
this guy is controlling

47:09.494 --> 47:11.028
the whole goddamn thing.

47:12.331 --> 47:14.131
Put it down.

47:20.539 --> 47:24.041
How the fuck was there a weapon
in that stack of clothes?

47:25.009 --> 47:26.578
Ask Harris.

47:26.611 --> 47:28.647
Don't try that shit.

47:28.680 --> 47:30.214
Those clothes
were all I gave you.

47:30.247 --> 47:31.483
It's a convenient story.

47:31.516 --> 47:33.284
What are you trying to pull?

47:33.317 --> 47:35.986
You put my life in danger
with your carelessness,

47:36.020 --> 47:37.489
and I had to defend myself.

47:37.522 --> 47:39.090
Guards.

47:40.057 --> 47:41.393
I'm detaining you.

47:41.426 --> 47:43.027
Lock her up.

47:43.060 --> 47:46.097
She doesn't get to talk
to anybody, see anybody.

47:47.298 --> 47:49.100
She doesn't get released
for any reason.

47:58.577 --> 48:00.945
Looks like we're not
the good guys anymore.

48:02.012 --> 48:03.914
You don't think I put
that gun in there, right?

48:03.948 --> 48:05.216
Don't be a fucking idiot.

48:05.249 --> 48:06.618
Come on, Bill.

48:06.651 --> 48:08.228
I think she just sees
herself as a patriot.

48:08.252 --> 48:10.354
Took matters into her own hands.

48:10.389 --> 48:12.323
It's not that simple.

48:12.356 --> 48:13.692
What do you mean?

48:13.725 --> 48:15.527
This guy Omar,

48:15.560 --> 48:17.438
he was always going
to leave here in a body bag.

48:17.462 --> 48:19.374
What does that have to do
with her taking matters

48:19.398 --> 48:20.998
into her own hands?

48:21.031 --> 48:22.534
She's not going
to do this by herself.

48:22.567 --> 48:25.002
There's some bigger picture
we're not seeing.

48:25.035 --> 48:26.505
We got to think smart, buddy,

48:26.538 --> 48:28.272
or we're going to get
run over here.

48:31.308 --> 48:32.977
What next?

48:34.078 --> 48:35.580
We get ready.

48:43.387 --> 48:45.557
Hey, Miller, I don't think
he's the enemy here.

48:45.590 --> 48:48.025
You sure? Because somebody's
been fucking with this op.

48:48.058 --> 48:50.629
Yeah, well, it could just
as easily be you, could be me.

48:50.662 --> 48:52.540
Can we talk about it
without shooting each other?

48:52.564 --> 48:55.966
Kavinsky has been getting
unsecured messages.

48:57.134 --> 48:58.335
Really?

48:58.369 --> 48:59.638
Yeah.

48:59.671 --> 49:02.741
That's right. I saw them.

49:02.774 --> 49:04.341
I asked him, he denied it.

49:04.375 --> 49:06.310
And they're not from Control.

49:07.779 --> 49:10.047
- Is it true?
- She's right.

49:10.080 --> 49:12.116
Well, that's interesting.

49:12.149 --> 49:14.227
I thought I saw you looking
at your phone, you sneaky fuck.

49:14.251 --> 49:15.487
Who sent them?

49:15.520 --> 49:17.589
- I don't know.
- Bullshit!

49:17.622 --> 49:20.291
I don't know.
I don't fucking know.

49:20.324 --> 49:22.193
Control's been
sending me messages too.

49:22.226 --> 49:25.564
They've detected incoming
messages on your line.

49:25.597 --> 49:27.231
They said under no circumstances

49:27.264 --> 49:29.066
am I allowed to let
you talk to the target.

49:29.099 --> 49:31.202
So now you're the one
following orders?

49:31.235 --> 49:32.737
That's the whole point,
isn't it?

49:34.171 --> 49:35.640
Follow orders. Keep it simple.

49:35.674 --> 49:37.374
You're the one
who told me that, right?

49:37.408 --> 49:39.109
That is what you said.

49:39.143 --> 49:40.721
All right, all right.
I did receive messages.

49:40.745 --> 49:42.581
I don't know who from.

49:42.614 --> 49:45.282
I told Control about it,
they told me not to open them.

49:45.316 --> 49:47.552
Why didn't you tell us sooner?

49:47.586 --> 49:49.630
The same reason you're pointing
a gun at me right now.

49:49.654 --> 49:51.288
All I know is
Control and orders,

49:51.322 --> 49:53.424
and right now
those two are fucked.

49:53.457 --> 49:56.260
When did the messages start?

49:56.293 --> 49:58.262
When we grabbed him.
Everything says we're walking

49:58.295 --> 49:59.640
straight into
a shit storm right now.

49:59.664 --> 50:01.198
Control cut us off.

50:01.232 --> 50:02.767
We have to fucking question him.

50:02.801 --> 50:05.202
Fine. You sit
your ass back down,

50:05.236 --> 50:07.806
we let this bird land
and we see what happens.

50:07.839 --> 50:09.349
Yeah, and we walk
straight into an ambush

50:09.373 --> 50:10.809
with our pants
around our ankles?

50:10.842 --> 50:12.644
No. No. We open up that message,

50:12.677 --> 50:14.445
rip his hood off
and see what's what.

50:14.478 --> 50:16.548
Or you guys could
just shoot each other.

50:17.516 --> 50:19.283
No.

50:20.251 --> 50:22.019
No, we open the message.

50:44.676 --> 50:48.379
You got it done in there.

50:48.412 --> 50:52.383
Ain't perfect, but it's done.

50:52.416 --> 50:54.629
Just clean enough to tell the
story the bosses want to tell.

50:54.653 --> 50:57.221
All right,
so we stick to the plan

50:57.254 --> 50:59.189
no matter how messy this gets.

51:05.529 --> 51:08.098
You sure you don't
want us to do this?

51:08.132 --> 51:09.533
I'm sure.

51:10.467 --> 51:12.202
Okay.

51:16.373 --> 51:18.509
Let's move.

51:32.389 --> 51:34.759
Okay, wait one second.

51:34.793 --> 51:37.361
Let's talk about this, okay?

51:37.394 --> 51:39.330
You don't want to do it.

51:44.803 --> 51:46.303
Whoever's pulling your strings,

51:46.337 --> 51:48.773
you're as expendable
to them as I am.

51:48.807 --> 51:51.141
No one is pulling my strings.

51:51.175 --> 51:53.745
Look, you shot a detainee.
I get it.

51:53.778 --> 51:55.479
You're scared.

51:55.512 --> 51:57.816
I'm scared.

51:57.849 --> 52:00.584
But if you help me bring in
whoever's running this show,

52:00.619 --> 52:03.320
we can get through
this together.

52:03.354 --> 52:06.290
I promise you that goes away.

52:06.323 --> 52:08.425
You shoot a fellow officer...

52:09.661 --> 52:11.796
there's no getting
back from that.

52:17.434 --> 52:19.938
All right.

52:19.971 --> 52:22.339
Very slowly,
I'm just going to...

52:41.793 --> 52:43.662
- Hey.
- Hey.

52:43.695 --> 52:44.963
Come in, please.

52:44.996 --> 52:46.865
It's nice in here. It's like a...

52:46.898 --> 52:49.600
It's like an episode
of <i>Homeland.</i>

52:49.633 --> 52:50.845
You're free to take
a load off, if you want.

52:50.869 --> 52:52.603
I'm all right.

52:52.636 --> 52:54.571
You're not too comfortable
indoors, are you?

52:54.605 --> 52:57.441
Well...

52:57.474 --> 53:00.210
You like it out there.
Get your hands dirty, you know?

53:00.244 --> 53:01.512
No restraints.

53:01.545 --> 53:03.748
- Yeah.
- I was looking in your file,

53:03.782 --> 53:05.315
seems you went a little rogue

53:05.349 --> 53:07.317
for a while there
in Afghanistan.

53:07.351 --> 53:10.855
Well, you know, it's hard
to say no to that many goats.

53:10.889 --> 53:12.757
I didn't see that coming.

53:12.791 --> 53:14.291
Just like the goat, huh?

53:15.592 --> 53:16.904
I figured I brought in
the right guy.

53:16.928 --> 53:18.429
- Yeah.
- No restraints.

53:18.462 --> 53:19.898
Want a gig?

53:19.931 --> 53:21.632
Uh, you know what?

53:21.665 --> 53:23.300
I'm ready for you.

53:23.333 --> 53:25.335
I've been frying chicken
for Colonel Sanders

53:25.369 --> 53:26.705
for the last two years.

53:26.738 --> 53:28.539
Even if they rip
your nails out, right?

53:28.572 --> 53:31.508
You'd never divulge the
secret 11 herbs and spices.

53:31.542 --> 53:32.977
Can't talk about that.

53:33.011 --> 53:35.679
There's somebody
you need to meet.

53:35.714 --> 53:37.949
It's not Debbie
from the Beirut desk, is it?

53:37.982 --> 53:41.251
Caroline,
could you come in, please?

53:42.286 --> 53:43.988
Toss him the line.

53:44.022 --> 53:46.490
All right, all right.

53:47.826 --> 53:49.560
I'm putting it down.

54:00.370 --> 54:02.406
I know that shooter.

54:05.576 --> 54:06.911
Me too.

54:08.079 --> 54:10.347
Caroline Visser.

54:10.380 --> 54:11.850
Reese.

54:11.883 --> 54:15.552
Hey. Reese.
Like the peanut butter cup.

54:15.586 --> 54:17.354
Nice to meet you.

54:18.555 --> 54:20.959
She'll be running point
on this op.

54:20.992 --> 54:22.559
That's great.

54:22.593 --> 54:24.294
I'm real excited.

54:24.328 --> 54:25.930
Yeah.

54:25.964 --> 54:28.800
This is going to be fun.

54:28.833 --> 54:30.835
She recruited all three of us,
all for this op.

54:30.869 --> 54:33.047
Yeah, and I guess she wasn't
looking for the A-team either.

54:33.071 --> 54:34.404
No offense.

54:34.438 --> 54:36.607
So why? Why us?

54:37.407 --> 54:38.943
Yeah, why us?

54:38.977 --> 54:40.979
All right, I received
an unsecured message

54:41.012 --> 54:42.781
on my secure line, right?

54:42.814 --> 54:44.691
Showing our common thread,
Visser killing someone

54:44.715 --> 54:46.283
in her own team.

54:53.423 --> 54:55.559
This guy's the source
of the messages.

54:57.761 --> 55:01.065
And I think I know
how he's transmitting them.

55:26.723 --> 55:28.458
Jesus.

56:15.940 --> 56:19.610
We need to free his arms.
That's the usual spot.

56:20.879 --> 56:22.646
Look, it's easier if I show you.

56:22.679 --> 56:23.780
Will you just trust me?

56:23.814 --> 56:25.449
All right.

56:29.120 --> 56:30.754
Come on.

56:35.525 --> 56:36.895
Struck out. Shit.

56:36.928 --> 56:38.897
It's the other one.

56:55.079 --> 56:56.780
- He'll live.
- Okay.

56:56.813 --> 56:58.782
You take the main exit,
I'll take the back.

57:12.896 --> 57:15.599
That's not going to open.

57:19.503 --> 57:21.005
Put it on the ground.

57:32.283 --> 57:34.953
This was all a sham.

57:34.986 --> 57:37.821
We play a complicated game.

57:37.854 --> 57:40.691
Allegiances change.

57:40.724 --> 57:43.894
You and Bill
weren't playing along.

57:45.896 --> 57:48.099
What happens to me?

57:49.700 --> 57:51.868
I don't have to
shoot you right here.

57:51.902 --> 57:53.237
You play along,

57:53.271 --> 57:56.140
maybe they don't burn you.

57:56.174 --> 58:00.677
Maybe you ought to stick
to being a guard.

58:02.146 --> 58:06.550
Yeah, they're not
letting you go.

58:07.784 --> 58:09.988
I'm surprised you picked
the obvious exit.

58:10.021 --> 58:13.124
I'm surprised you fell for it.

58:13.157 --> 58:15.159
What?

58:38.648 --> 58:40.084
I'll go after him.

58:40.118 --> 58:41.551
Let him go. He's burned.

58:44.755 --> 58:46.857
What was he doing
in the surveillance room?

58:48.026 --> 58:50.028
Shit.

58:56.833 --> 58:58.769
- What the hell?
- That's it.

58:58.802 --> 59:01.605
- What?
- Data hold.

59:01.638 --> 59:03.607
A thin drive encased by plastic.

59:03.640 --> 59:05.219
The Russians have been using
a lot lately,

59:05.243 --> 59:07.245
even though it causes
nasty infections.

59:07.278 --> 59:08.912
You know Russia.

59:08.945 --> 59:10.214
Oh, God.

59:10.248 --> 59:12.682
Get some penicillin, buddy.

59:12.716 --> 59:14.827
You can program it using
a frequency in a specific range,

59:14.851 --> 59:17.321
and then set it
to broadcast on repeat.

59:17.355 --> 59:20.258
All right, why was I the only
one receiving the message?

59:20.291 --> 59:22.025
Because it picked up
your device first,

59:22.060 --> 59:23.593
so it must have locked on.

59:23.627 --> 59:26.264
And that's why
he let us catch him.

59:26.297 --> 59:29.032
He wanted us to see
that video of Visser.

59:29.067 --> 59:32.702
Shit, I can't even pair
my Bluetooth with my headphones.

59:32.736 --> 59:34.281
All right, okay, look,
let's find out why.

59:34.305 --> 59:35.906
Cover him.

59:41.711 --> 59:45.715
Okay, you have two guns
on you right now.

59:45.749 --> 59:47.984
You do anything
mildly confusing,

59:48.018 --> 59:49.886
anything makes me
feel uncomfortable,

59:49.920 --> 59:52.356
you will be shot dead,
do you understand that?

59:59.163 --> 1:00:00.897
Do it.

1:00:00.931 --> 1:00:02.599
All right.

1:00:12.943 --> 1:00:14.811
We're descending.

1:00:17.148 --> 1:00:20.118
Assuming that's not
part of the plan.

1:00:21.452 --> 1:00:23.854
We've been in the air
for almost two hours,

1:00:23.887 --> 1:00:25.423
heading in the direction
of Thailand.

1:00:25.456 --> 1:00:26.957
I knew it, I knew it.

1:00:26.990 --> 1:00:28.859
Yeah, it's always Thailand.

1:00:28.892 --> 1:00:31.027
Get away with anything
in Thailand.

1:00:33.864 --> 1:00:35.899
That puts us
over Eastern Europe.

1:00:37.934 --> 1:00:39.903
We're going to Kosovo.

1:00:41.272 --> 1:00:42.739
And why?

1:00:42.772 --> 1:00:44.975
Decommissioned black site.

1:00:45.008 --> 1:00:46.710
No oversight.

1:00:46.743 --> 1:00:48.678
No eyes.

1:00:52.082 --> 1:00:54.218
That's where Visser will be.

1:00:56.119 --> 1:00:58.456
- Shit.
- She needs me dead.

1:00:58.489 --> 1:01:00.824
Actually, she needs
all three of you dead.

1:01:00.857 --> 1:01:04.395
You're welcome for taking out
Manson and Bundy, by the way.

1:01:04.428 --> 1:01:06.830
They were going
to kill you in midair.

1:01:06.863 --> 1:01:08.932
I... Who are you, all right?

1:01:08.965 --> 1:01:11.735
And why are you carrying
that video around in your arm?

1:01:13.103 --> 1:01:15.705
I'm just a loose end
she needs to cut off.

1:01:16.773 --> 1:01:18.108
She murdered my friend.

1:01:18.141 --> 1:01:19.943
So I let her find me,

1:01:19.976 --> 1:01:22.913
took out Manson and Bundy
before they could kill you.

1:01:22.946 --> 1:01:24.748
I can get your eyes
on that video,

1:01:24.781 --> 1:01:27.251
then maybe you're down
to help me out,

1:01:27.285 --> 1:01:28.952
so I have a team.

1:01:30.053 --> 1:01:31.988
Now here we are.

1:01:34.791 --> 1:01:36.260
Then we kill her.

1:01:36.294 --> 1:01:38.229
Aren't you glad
we opened that message?

1:01:38.262 --> 1:01:39.996
You signed our death warrant.

1:01:40.030 --> 1:01:41.831
You were dead the minute
you agreed to this.

1:01:41.865 --> 1:01:45.001
You're all military gypsies.
There's no paperwork on you.

1:01:45.035 --> 1:01:46.204
Fuck!

1:01:46.237 --> 1:01:47.938
Her team brought you in,
trained you.

1:01:47.971 --> 1:01:50.807
No, it wasn't her team. No.

1:01:50.840 --> 1:01:52.809
It was a guy.

1:01:54.312 --> 1:01:57.281
Either way, they will Bury you
without a trace.

1:01:58.815 --> 1:02:01.151
You're assets, not officers.

1:02:01.184 --> 1:02:04.020
And probably with back stories
that make it easy

1:02:04.054 --> 1:02:06.189
to discredit you if need be.

1:02:08.392 --> 1:02:10.126
Coming in hot.

1:02:14.097 --> 1:02:15.233
Hey, what do we do?

1:02:15.266 --> 1:02:16.900
Buckle up.

1:02:16.933 --> 1:02:18.134
The facts that matter are,

1:02:18.168 --> 1:02:20.971
we kill her or she kills us.

1:02:21.004 --> 1:02:23.241
It's that simple.

1:02:23.274 --> 1:02:25.409
Is she going to be on
the ground when we land?

1:02:25.443 --> 1:02:27.378
Without a doubt.

1:02:28.412 --> 1:02:30.514
All right.

1:02:30.548 --> 1:02:33.850
We need to make it look like
we never figured it out.

1:02:37.988 --> 1:02:39.423
Good night.

1:02:42.326 --> 1:02:43.860
All right, guys.

1:02:43.893 --> 1:02:45.895
I don't know where the bullets

1:02:45.929 --> 1:02:47.864
are going to be coming in from,

1:02:47.897 --> 1:02:50.100
but I'm with you.

1:02:51.469 --> 1:02:53.437
That's all I got.

1:03:33.444 --> 1:03:35.045
Reese.

1:03:37.280 --> 1:03:39.082
Here we go.

1:03:42.486 --> 1:03:45.456
What's this?
All right, let's gear up.

1:03:59.537 --> 1:04:01.204
Let's play this out.

1:04:16.420 --> 1:04:18.188
Reese, take your six.

1:04:22.058 --> 1:04:23.893
Hey, guys, you know "Kosovo"

1:04:23.927 --> 1:04:26.397
means "field of black birds"
in Serbian?

1:04:26.430 --> 1:04:27.997
That's kind of cool, right?

1:04:28.031 --> 1:04:29.966
Just like <i>Game of Thrones.</i>

1:04:29.999 --> 1:04:31.569
Shut the fuck up, Reese.

1:04:31.602 --> 1:04:34.337
You sure you can sort
this all out on your own?

1:04:34.372 --> 1:04:37.340
Yes, I'm certain
they haven't even caught on.

1:04:39.042 --> 1:04:41.412
I should have this thing
wrapped up in a few.

1:04:45.014 --> 1:04:46.325
If you don't
deal with them quickly,

1:04:46.349 --> 1:04:47.685
you're going to find yourself

1:04:47.718 --> 1:04:49.953
with a very unpleasant
liability on your hands.

1:04:49.986 --> 1:04:52.021
I have a backup team
inbound to assist.

1:04:52.055 --> 1:04:54.090
<i>No one knows how many
hundreds or even thousands</i>

1:04:54.124 --> 1:04:56.427
of boys' lives won't have
to be lost in the desert

1:04:56.460 --> 1:04:58.294
because of your work.

1:04:58.328 --> 1:05:00.063
Considering this is
the only thanks

1:05:00.096 --> 1:05:01.998
you'll probably ever get,

1:05:02.031 --> 1:05:04.502
I just wanted
to make it personally.

1:05:04.535 --> 1:05:06.136
Thank you, sir.

1:05:06.169 --> 1:05:07.904
<i>Thank you.</i>

1:05:26.524 --> 1:05:28.492
Hey, Kavinsky,

1:05:28.526 --> 1:05:30.026
no matter what happens

1:05:30.059 --> 1:05:32.996
don't let Visser
get a hold of your line.

1:05:35.198 --> 1:05:36.600
I copy you.

1:05:39.335 --> 1:05:41.938
This place is huge.

1:05:44.107 --> 1:05:46.176
Where's the welcome wagon?

1:05:47.410 --> 1:05:49.279
Now quiet.

1:05:50.046 --> 1:05:51.482
Eyes open.

1:06:06.296 --> 1:06:08.666
Easy. Easy guys.

1:06:08.699 --> 1:06:10.366
You're in the clear.

1:06:10.400 --> 1:06:12.335
We'll wait
for visual confirmation.

1:06:12.368 --> 1:06:14.672
We're secured.
You can holster your weapons.

1:06:14.705 --> 1:06:16.072
- Hold.
- Okay.

1:06:16.105 --> 1:06:17.508
We'll come to you.

1:06:17.541 --> 1:06:19.643
Okay.

1:06:19.677 --> 1:06:23.079
This whole job's
been a little hairy.

1:06:23.112 --> 1:06:25.415
Hairier than your mom's nipples.

1:06:25.448 --> 1:06:28.619
But you guys handled it.
Nicely done.

1:06:28.652 --> 1:06:31.187
- Is it just you?
- You know how it is.

1:06:31.221 --> 1:06:33.089
The fewer people, the better.

1:06:33.122 --> 1:06:35.358
Ex-fil team's on
it's way to take him.

1:06:35.391 --> 1:06:37.427
Yeah, where are we?

1:06:37.460 --> 1:06:39.329
Just sit tight.

1:06:39.362 --> 1:06:41.030
They'll be here any second.

1:06:41.064 --> 1:06:42.733
Why'd you go radio silent on us?

1:06:42.766 --> 1:06:44.400
I couldn't risk
communicating with you

1:06:44.434 --> 1:06:46.469
if your line was compromised,
you know that.

1:06:46.504 --> 1:06:47.805
Speaking of your line,

1:06:47.838 --> 1:06:49.640
let's take care of that
right now.

1:06:52.242 --> 1:06:54.377
- Who is he?
- No clue.

1:06:54.410 --> 1:06:55.779
They keep us in the dark too.

1:06:55.813 --> 1:06:57.715
So, yeah, like I said,
give me your line

1:06:57.748 --> 1:07:01.785
so my team can run
a diagnostic on it.

1:07:01.819 --> 1:07:03.721
- Want this line? Yeah?
- Yeah, that one.

1:07:03.754 --> 1:07:06.456
I can take care of it
right now, no problem.

1:07:06.489 --> 1:07:08.091
Wait, stop!

1:07:10.528 --> 1:07:12.071
I mean, if it's compromised
like you're saying,

1:07:12.095 --> 1:07:13.463
I should get rid
of it right now.

1:07:13.496 --> 1:07:15.231
- I should destroy it, right?
- Yeah, sure.

1:07:15.265 --> 1:07:18.301
- That's what I should do.
- Go for it.

1:07:20.336 --> 1:07:22.505
So now does it matter to you?

1:07:22.540 --> 1:07:24.240
I mean, the dick pics

1:07:24.274 --> 1:07:26.075
probably already uploaded
to the cloud,

1:07:26.109 --> 1:07:28.378
so, you know, damage done.

1:07:28.411 --> 1:07:31.414
What about those
body bags on the plane?

1:07:31.447 --> 1:07:35.285
You are go
for Operation Clean Sweep.

1:07:35.318 --> 1:07:38.187
No dust bunnies.

1:07:38.221 --> 1:07:39.790
<i>Copy.</i>

1:07:41.457 --> 1:07:44.160
Green light
on Operation Clean Sweep.

1:07:49.299 --> 1:07:52.201
We need the floor
completely clean.

1:07:52.235 --> 1:07:53.804
<i>Roger that, sir.</i>

1:07:53.837 --> 1:07:55.405
Good.

1:07:58.141 --> 1:08:00.410
Everyone on the ground
is considered hostile.

1:08:00.443 --> 1:08:02.211
No exceptions.

1:08:05.381 --> 1:08:08.384
How about those body bags?

1:08:11.454 --> 1:08:13.423
You saw the video.

1:08:17.761 --> 1:08:19.863
You want to know
who this guy is?

1:08:21.865 --> 1:08:24.267
This is a guy who turned
his back on his duty.

1:08:24.300 --> 1:08:26.402
And now he is facing
the consequences.

1:08:26.436 --> 1:08:28.404
Do not be like him!

1:08:28.438 --> 1:08:30.206
- Do your duty!
- Move, move!

1:08:43.754 --> 1:08:46.522
I see this is going well.

1:08:58.936 --> 1:09:00.738
<i>Inbound heavy.</i>

1:09:02.940 --> 1:09:05.575
<i>Past the target, 40 seconds.</i>

1:09:10.848 --> 1:09:13.416
<i>Thirty seconds.</i>

1:09:16.720 --> 1:09:18.554
Damn it!

1:09:18.588 --> 1:09:20.691
Ah, shit.

1:09:20.724 --> 1:09:23.326
Hey, you okay?

1:09:23.359 --> 1:09:25.294
Yeah, it's nothing.

1:09:25.328 --> 1:09:26.764
Whoever's coming in that bird,

1:09:26.797 --> 1:09:28.598
I don't think
they're here to help us.

1:09:31.835 --> 1:09:34.203
<i>Touchdown, ten seconds.</i>

1:09:39.677 --> 1:09:41.611
Move! Go, go, go!

1:09:44.580 --> 1:09:46.750
Move it, move it!

1:09:53.857 --> 1:09:55.425
Move!

1:09:56.526 --> 1:09:58.294
Move it, move it!

1:10:01.899 --> 1:10:03.466
It's time for Plan B.

1:10:03.499 --> 1:10:05.668
- Wait, what was Plan A?
- Kill Visser.

1:10:05.703 --> 1:10:07.871
It was? But I don't think
we even talked about that.

1:10:07.905 --> 1:10:09.707
So, what's Plan B?

1:10:09.740 --> 1:10:11.441
Kill them all.

1:10:11.474 --> 1:10:12.910
Okay, I get with that plan.

1:10:14.011 --> 1:10:15.645
Hockey puck!

1:10:18.347 --> 1:10:19.783
Oh, shit!

1:10:21.018 --> 1:10:22.618
Move it, move it!

1:10:22.652 --> 1:10:25.555
Move, move, move now!

1:10:25.588 --> 1:10:27.590
You, me, you, me, you, me.

1:10:27.623 --> 1:10:29.292
Okay, yeah!

1:10:32.295 --> 1:10:33.396
All right, move.

1:10:33.429 --> 1:10:34.998
Now!

1:10:38.736 --> 1:10:40.636
Got one.

1:10:49.913 --> 1:10:51.714
- Oh!
- Reese!

1:10:51.749 --> 1:10:53.416
Son of a bitch.

1:10:55.986 --> 1:10:58.588
It's all right.

1:10:58.621 --> 1:11:00.590
It's okay. It's okay, man.
You'll be all right.

1:11:00.623 --> 1:11:01.657
Okay, yeah.

1:11:01.691 --> 1:11:03.894
No.

1:11:07.497 --> 1:11:09.532
Get to Miller.

1:11:09.565 --> 1:11:10.877
- I'll cover you.
- No, no, no, no.

1:11:10.901 --> 1:11:12.468
- We need to get you help.
- Yeah.

1:11:12.502 --> 1:11:13.780
We just need to get you
out of here.

1:11:13.804 --> 1:11:16.506
The devil's calling me home.

1:11:16.539 --> 1:11:18.008
All right.

1:11:18.041 --> 1:11:20.643
I'm gonna a take
a few more sinners with me.

1:11:20.676 --> 1:11:21.744
Jesus.

1:11:30.921 --> 1:11:32.823
Shit!

1:11:32.856 --> 1:11:34.357
Reese!

1:11:34.390 --> 1:11:35.758
Reese is...

1:11:35.793 --> 1:11:37.861
Yeah, he's down.

1:11:45.568 --> 1:11:46.804
How many are there?

1:11:46.837 --> 1:11:49.405
Seven. Plus Visser.

1:11:49.438 --> 1:11:51.975
- And us?
- Three. Including you.

1:12:06.489 --> 1:12:07.858
Miller!

1:12:18.101 --> 1:12:19.802
My first kill.

1:12:19.837 --> 1:12:21.404
- Good!
- Yeah.

1:12:21.437 --> 1:12:22.873
We can't stay here.
Cover my left.

1:12:22.906 --> 1:12:25.008
- What are you doing?
- Flushing them out. Go.

1:12:48.564 --> 1:12:49.933
Fuck!

1:13:00.210 --> 1:13:03.080
Approaching the target building.
Standing by for extraction.

1:13:03.113 --> 1:13:05.581
<i>Copy that.</i>

1:13:19.595 --> 1:13:21.631
Ah!

1:13:25.035 --> 1:13:26.736
Cover!

1:13:35.745 --> 1:13:37.114
I'm out!

1:13:47.723 --> 1:13:50.127
Cover.

1:13:50.160 --> 1:13:52.461
What's that mean?
We're supposed to go to him?

1:13:53.863 --> 1:13:55.198
Run!

1:14:04.540 --> 1:14:06.542
You good?

1:14:06.575 --> 1:14:07.810
I'm good.

1:14:07.843 --> 1:14:09.512
You got to get out of here.

1:14:09.545 --> 1:14:10.680
What about Visser?

1:14:10.713 --> 1:14:11.814
She's the reason we're here.

1:14:11.847 --> 1:14:12.950
She's my problem.

1:14:12.983 --> 1:14:14.884
Get lost.
Maybe you'll get lucky.

1:14:14.917 --> 1:14:16.963
She's the only one who knows
about you, you can disappear.

1:14:16.987 --> 1:14:18.854
No, there's another guy
who knows about us too.

1:14:18.888 --> 1:14:20.856
- Let me start with her.
- Go.

1:14:20.890 --> 1:14:22.491
Go, we'll cover you.

1:14:43.013 --> 1:14:44.714
Come on.

1:14:44.747 --> 1:14:47.117
Come on.

1:14:59.862 --> 1:15:01.564
<i>Please check the number</i>

1:15:01.597 --> 1:15:03.000
<i>or call directory assistance.</i>

1:15:03.899 --> 1:15:05.268
Fuck.

1:15:08.005 --> 1:15:09.572
Fuck.

1:16:24.814 --> 1:16:26.782
Did you think
that killing two innocent men

1:16:26.816 --> 1:16:28.584
makes you a patriot?

1:16:33.656 --> 1:16:35.925
At least Bill didn't hide!

1:16:43.666 --> 1:16:46.035
How did you go so astray?

1:16:46.068 --> 1:16:49.004
Same background as me,
same résumé.

1:16:55.911 --> 1:16:59.282
Lined up for a long career
in the service.

1:17:03.919 --> 1:17:06.423
Fuck you!

1:17:06.456 --> 1:17:09.758
But here you are
killing innocent people.

1:17:09.792 --> 1:17:13.095
And here I am,
forced to kill you.

1:17:16.433 --> 1:17:18.667
<i>Head back,
maintain your position.</i>

1:17:19.402 --> 1:17:22.405
Ten seconds.

1:17:30.112 --> 1:17:32.382
<i>We got three operators for XO.</i>

1:17:43.058 --> 1:17:44.261
Let's get this over with.

1:17:44.294 --> 1:17:46.263
Shoes off.

1:17:46.296 --> 1:17:47.830
This is not
how I saw this going.

1:17:47.863 --> 1:17:49.299
Nice.

1:17:50.367 --> 1:17:51.934
They're expecting five bodies.

1:17:51.967 --> 1:17:53.379
We're gonna give them
a bunch of body parts

1:17:53.403 --> 1:17:54.770
with five pairs of shoes.

1:17:54.803 --> 1:17:56.005
Five?

1:17:56.038 --> 1:17:57.940
Visser was never
getting out either.

1:17:57.973 --> 1:17:59.376
Are you sure
this is going to work?

1:17:59.409 --> 1:18:01.110
Give me one of those
thermite grenades,

1:18:01.143 --> 1:18:03.246
they'll be counting shoes
to figure if we're dead.

1:18:10.187 --> 1:18:11.954
Sending.

1:18:14.957 --> 1:18:16.792
They're coming through!

1:18:37.179 --> 1:18:38.881
What's the verdict, soldier?

1:18:38.914 --> 1:18:40.950
<i>We took seven KIAs, sir.</i>

1:18:40.983 --> 1:18:43.786
Can confirm unknown number
of enemy deceased.

1:18:43.819 --> 1:18:45.322
In English.

1:18:45.355 --> 1:18:46.922
<i>There was an explosion.</i>

1:18:46.956 --> 1:18:48.791
It's impossible
to tell how many died.

1:18:48.824 --> 1:18:51.060
We count several types
of shoes in the debris.

1:18:51.093 --> 1:18:54.397
<i>My assessment is no survivors.</i>

1:18:54.431 --> 1:18:55.931
Very well, stand by.

1:18:55.965 --> 1:18:57.733
I'll be back.

1:19:09.346 --> 1:19:10.879
Come in, sir.

1:19:10.913 --> 1:19:12.549
I have classified tests to run.

1:19:12.582 --> 1:19:15.352
Do you have assets
with strike capability

1:19:15.385 --> 1:19:17.554
in Grid 4-5-8?

1:19:17.587 --> 1:19:19.888
Wait one second, sir.

1:19:23.993 --> 1:19:26.962
Affirmative.
What are the orders?

1:19:26.996 --> 1:19:30.132
I'm going to remote enter
via the command entry system.

1:19:30.165 --> 1:19:32.535
Please share the screen
for my eyes only.

1:19:32.569 --> 1:19:37.574
Authorization code:
5-November-Juliet-Cobra.

1:19:37.607 --> 1:19:39.908
Color of the day is orange.

1:19:42.379 --> 1:19:44.113
<i>Copy.</i>

1:19:46.115 --> 1:19:47.950
<i>You're all set, sir.</i>

1:19:47.983 --> 1:19:49.818
<i>Have a nice day.</i>

1:19:49.852 --> 1:19:51.421
Thank you.

1:19:59.194 --> 1:20:01.398
Okay, son,
we're good to wrap this up.

1:20:01.431 --> 1:20:03.999
Make sure all the elements
have been placed.

1:20:09.639 --> 1:20:11.240
The bodies are placed, sir.

1:20:11.273 --> 1:20:14.209
Okay, boys, you get
back safe, you hear?

1:20:16.912 --> 1:20:19.449
<i>We got three operators
for extract.</i>

1:20:20.350 --> 1:20:22.117
Go, go, go, go!

1:20:58.388 --> 1:21:01.458
Alan, I want to issue
a press release.

1:21:18.240 --> 1:21:19.908
Hey, Olsen.

1:21:19.942 --> 1:21:21.511
Mr. Deputy Director.

1:21:21.544 --> 1:21:23.513
You look hungry.
How about some lunch?

1:21:23.546 --> 1:21:26.683
You know, I got a hankering
for some barbecue.

1:21:26.716 --> 1:21:28.585
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

1:21:28.618 --> 1:21:31.019
<i>U.S. officials
are attributing the attack</i>

1:21:31.053 --> 1:21:33.956
<i>to an organization called
the Crescent Democratic Front,</i>

1:21:33.989 --> 1:21:37.192
<i>a resistance group formed
in opposition to the regime</i>

1:21:37.226 --> 1:21:39.562
<i>of Bandar El-Mizdawi.</i>

1:21:39.596 --> 1:21:41.564
<i>U.S. intelligence sources say</i>

1:21:41.598 --> 1:21:44.933
<i>that CDF has recently aligned
itself with Al-Qaeda,</i>

1:21:44.967 --> 1:21:46.636
<i>calling the West occupiers...</i>

1:21:46.669 --> 1:21:48.103
Thank you.

1:21:48.137 --> 1:21:49.572
Would you like a fry?

1:21:49.606 --> 1:21:51.441
Alrighty, then. Thank you.

1:21:53.142 --> 1:21:54.677
Well...

1:21:54.711 --> 1:21:56.479
Tell me how it is.

1:21:56.513 --> 1:21:59.181
Here's to cardiac arrest.

1:22:02.084 --> 1:22:04.119
Tastes good.

1:22:04.153 --> 1:22:07.624
<i>The bombing was carried out by
political refugee, Omar Abadi.</i>

1:22:07.657 --> 1:22:09.324
<i>We are told that at least</i>

1:22:09.358 --> 1:22:11.594
<i>eight U.S. military contractors
were killed,</i>

1:22:11.628 --> 1:22:13.295
<i>which also claimed the lives</i>

1:22:13.328 --> 1:22:15.397
<i>of several
intelligence officers.</i>

1:23:18.393 --> 1:23:20.128
Did it work?

1:23:20.162 --> 1:23:22.297
Oh, it worked.

1:23:28.505 --> 1:23:30.172
What's he doing?

1:23:32.140 --> 1:23:34.443
Drive!

1:24:01.638 --> 1:24:03.706
Yeah, what is it?

1:24:05.642 --> 1:24:08.076
We have a problem.
