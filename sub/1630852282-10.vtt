Where's Patrick?

10:33.759 --> 10:35.469
‐ [door bangs]
‐ Holy shit!

10:39.264 --> 10:41.683
‐ [groans]

10:41.683 --> 10:43.393
[vomits]

10:44.436 --> 10:46.063
Guys. You're here.

10:46.063 --> 10:47.773
Oh, thank God.

10:47.773 --> 10:49.942
‐ That shit golem sounds like Patrick.

10:49.942 --> 10:51.777
Oh no, nope, nope.

10:51.777 --> 10:53.570
‐ If you hug me, I'll kill you.

10:53.570 --> 10:57.282
‐ There's been a coup.
The royal family's going to be executed.

10:57.282 --> 10:58.617
You've got to help me free them.

10:59.576 --> 11:01.203
‐ Why would we ever do that?

11:01.203 --> 11:05.040
‐ [scoffs]
Because it's our king and queen.

11:05.040 --> 11:08.210
‐ I don't even know the king's name, man.
Wait, is it Murray?

11:08.210 --> 11:10.963
‐ Patrick, it doesn't matter
who sits on the throne.

11:10.963 --> 11:13.924
Kings and queens come and go,
but they're all the same.

11:13.924 --> 11:16.051
They get rich and fat
while the rest of us suffer.

11:16.051 --> 11:19.596
‐ Seriously, is it King Murray
and Queen Tina?

11:19.596 --> 11:21.223
I think that's right, right?

11:21.223 --> 11:23.642
‐ What gives them the right to steal
from the rest of us?

11:23.642 --> 11:26.019
‐ Wha‐‐?
But that's what you do.

11:26.895 --> 11:28.730
‐ Yes, well,
at least we're upfront about it.

11:28.730 --> 11:32.359
‐ And look, while you're here, um, you've
got the drawing skills in the family.

11:32.359 --> 11:36.113
Um, how about just whipping up
a quick map to the vault, huh?

11:36.113 --> 11:38.115
[cloaks rustling]

11:38.115 --> 11:39.616
[blades clang]

11:39.616 --> 11:40.951
Oh, and we're surrounded.

11:41.660 --> 11:44.621
‐ I guess you have no choice now, huh?

11:44.621 --> 11:46.498
You have to help me fight.

11:46.498 --> 11:50.043
‐ They're not our enemy, Patrick.
They're yours.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.879
Do you want this squire?
You can have him.

11:51.879 --> 11:53.881
We're doing our own thing, don't mind us.

11:53.881 --> 11:54.965
PATRICK:
What?

11:56.758 --> 12:00.012
God dammit.
I didn't choose to be your little brother.

12:00.012 --> 12:04.766
But I always believed, deep down,
that when it mattered, you'd have my back.

12:04.766 --> 12:06.977
Because I'm your family.

12:07.686 --> 12:09.813
But if that's not true...

12:09.813 --> 12:13.400
I guess I have no one to blame
but myself.

12:14.067 --> 12:17.154
You told me my whole life I didn't matter.

12:18.280 --> 12:21.116
It's my fault for not believing you.

12:25.621 --> 12:27.247
‐ Ah, fuck, he's right.

12:27.247 --> 12:28.332
Huh!

12:28.332 --> 12:30.292
‐ He's our brother. Huh!

12:30.292 --> 12:34.129
‐ Yeah! And nobody beats up
our brother but us.

12:34.129 --> 12:35.339
Bam!
‐ [clown horn honks]

12:35.339 --> 12:37.591
‐ Thanks, you guys.

12:37.591 --> 12:39.343
[snarling]

12:39.343 --> 12:40.969
[shrieking]

12:45.265 --> 12:46.475
‐ Suck on this!

12:48.310 --> 12:49.811
‐ Heh‐heh‐hey!

12:49.811 --> 12:51.021
[clown horn honks]

12:53.690 --> 12:55.192
‐ Ugggh!
‐ Patrick!

12:57.236 --> 12:59.029
[straining]

12:59.029 --> 13:00.948
‐ Jesus Christ, Patrick!

13:00.948 --> 13:03.909
‐ My girlfriend's evil
and I'm covered in shit.

13:03.909 --> 13:07.120
I'm working through some residual anger.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.830
Huh?
‐ [straining]

13:08.830 --> 13:10.832
‐ [panting]

13:10.832 --> 13:12.125
Oh, God.

13:13.210 --> 13:15.087
‐ Oh, hell no.

13:19.007 --> 13:22.761
‐ Ugh, this tower is murder
on my quads. Oh!

13:22.761 --> 13:23.887
PATRICK:
Sloane!

13:24.471 --> 13:26.265
Ha‐ha!
‐ Danielle.

13:26.265 --> 13:29.101
‐ Sorry, I can't keep your lies straight.

13:29.101 --> 13:30.060
BOTH:
Hah!

13:30.060 --> 13:32.020
‐ [straining]
‐ [blades clanging]

13:36.733 --> 13:38.777
‐ Don't be mad at me.

13:39.486 --> 13:42.739
If you adjust your perspective
a teensy bit,

13:42.739 --> 13:45.784
I'm actually the hero of this story.

13:45.784 --> 13:46.869
‐ Uggh! What?

13:48.662 --> 13:51.415
You're a liar.
And a killer.

13:52.708 --> 13:55.878
‐ What choice did I have?
My mother is the rightful queen.

13:55.878 --> 13:58.088
You can't deny that.

13:58.088 --> 14:00.048
‐ [statue clangs]
‐ It's not that simple.

14:00.048 --> 14:01.466
[straining]

14:02.551 --> 14:04.928
Uggh! [sighs]

14:04.928 --> 14:09.683
The Old King locked up Donna.
But then Merriman locked up the Old King.

14:09.683 --> 14:12.644
‐ What? The Old King died of plague.

14:12.644 --> 14:16.773
‐ The Old King is still alive.
Donna isn't the rightful anything.

14:16.773 --> 14:18.066
And neither is Merriman.

14:18.066 --> 14:21.028
‐ That... That can't be true.

14:22.321 --> 14:27.409
‐ Look, what happened to your mom sucks.
Chastity belts are barbaric.

14:27.409 --> 14:29.161
But according to the law,

14:29.161 --> 14:32.414
she gave up her shot at the throne
when she broke the rules.

14:32.414 --> 14:35.167
‐ But Merriman broke the rules too.
So what does it matter?

14:35.167 --> 14:36.752
[strains]

14:36.752 --> 14:39.588
Join us!
My mother is queen now.

14:39.588 --> 14:42.674
She can make you a knight.
You can be my boyfriend.

14:42.674 --> 14:45.719
And if we work as a couple,
you know, travel well together,

14:45.719 --> 14:47.304
see how cohabitation goes.

14:47.304 --> 14:50.641
Who knows?
You could be king one day.

14:50.641 --> 14:51.934
[thwack]

14:51.934 --> 14:54.311
[glass tinkling]

14:55.354 --> 14:57.731
[Patrick gasps]

14:57.731 --> 15:01.818
‐ So, you really feel that way about me?
You weren't just using me?

15:02.903 --> 15:07.950
‐ Oh, you weren't even a part of my plan.
You were just a happy accident.

15:07.950 --> 15:09.952
I liked hanging out with you.

15:09.952 --> 15:11.620
‐ God dammit. I...

15:11.620 --> 15:12.621
[sighs]

15:12.621 --> 15:14.540
I liked it too.

15:14.540 --> 15:17.167
‐ It doesn't matter who sits
on the throne.

15:17.167 --> 15:21.421
Kings and queens come and go,
but they're all the same.

15:22.214 --> 15:23.215
‐ [sighs]

15:23.215 --> 15:26.969
And Merriman is
an objectively terrible ruler.

15:26.969 --> 15:29.054
The people are suffering.

15:29.054 --> 15:31.765
‐ Exactly.
You'd be doing the right thing.

15:31.765 --> 15:32.975
For everybody.

15:32.975 --> 15:36.228
Plus you'd get to see me naked.

15:36.228 --> 15:37.187
‐ [Patrick moans]

15:37.187 --> 15:39.857
That does sound like a win‐win.

15:42.359 --> 15:44.069
Oh...

15:48.615 --> 15:49.783
‐ Yaaa!

15:50.909 --> 15:52.953
Well, that was annoying.

15:52.953 --> 15:54.037
‐ Alright, fun's over.

15:54.037 --> 15:56.957
Let's go commit some crimes
to balance out the good deed.

15:56.957 --> 16:00.294
‐ Time for Operation Steal Stuff
We're Gonna Steal

16:00.294 --> 16:03.172
Before We Got Sidetracked
By Personal Growth.

16:03.172 --> 16:04.214
[clown horn honks]

16:05.883 --> 16:10.345
‐ I mean, I bet I'd get a lot more respect
at home if I were king.

16:10.345 --> 16:13.515
‐ And it could happen
sooner than you think.

16:13.515 --> 16:17.436
Mother could always catch a bad case
of fall‐down‐the‐stairs‐itis,

16:17.436 --> 16:18.687
if you know what I mean.

16:18.687 --> 16:22.274
‐ [gasps]
You'd kill your own mother?

16:22.274 --> 16:23.901
No. I'm sorry.

16:23.901 --> 16:26.820
I swore an oath
and I'm not going back on it.

16:26.820 --> 16:31.742
Promises don't seem to mean
that much to you, but they do to me!

16:31.742 --> 16:33.452
Haaaa!

16:33.452 --> 16:36.830
‐ You dickhead!
Now you're never gonna see me naked.

16:36.830 --> 16:38.123
Think about that.

16:38.123 --> 16:39.458
‐ Haaaa!

16:43.086 --> 16:45.923
Give up. Your people
are getting their asses kicked.

16:45.923 --> 16:49.593
And once the army hears you've attacked
the castle, they'll return to help.

16:49.593 --> 16:50.677
You can't win.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.971
‐ Yes, I can! [chuckles]

16:52.971 --> 16:55.015
I'll blow up the royal family!

16:55.015 --> 16:58.101
And I already killed everyone else
in the line of succession.

16:58.101 --> 16:59.269
So guess what?

16:59.269 --> 17:03.065
It's gonna be Mother
or it's gonna be nobody!

17:03.065 --> 17:04.650
‐ Arggh!

17:06.401 --> 17:07.444
‐ [gasps] No!

17:11.365 --> 17:13.242

‐ Blossom!
‐ Sweetheart. Are you alright?

17:28.090 --> 17:29.550
‐ I'm still alive, Mom.

17:29.550 --> 17:32.928
Don't make such a big deal
out of everything. God.

17:32.928 --> 17:34.680
[screaming] Mama!

17:34.680 --> 17:37.933

I'm busy not making a big deal out of it.

[gasping]

18:04.168 --> 18:05.919
‐ Give up, Danielle.

18:05.919 --> 18:08.463
‐ Give up? I already won.

18:08.463 --> 18:10.424
Once this tower falls,

18:10.424 --> 18:15.804
the only heir to the throne
still alive will be Mother!

18:15.804 --> 18:18.223
‐ It's a perfect plan, sweetheart.

18:18.223 --> 18:20.726
‐ Mother?
What the fuck are you doing up here?

18:20.726 --> 18:22.102
‐ I came back for Daniel.

18:22.102 --> 18:25.314
‐ Oh! You're ruining everything!

18:25.314 --> 18:26.565
PATRICK:
Huh?

18:26.565 --> 18:28.692
[castle rumbling]

18:29.776 --> 18:31.737
‐ Fine. Go ahead and die, Mother.

18:31.737 --> 18:33.989
That means I'm heir to the throne.

Squirrel wings!

Huhhh!

Raised in a circus, bitch!

18:40.871 --> 18:42.539
‐ Waaaa!

18:45.042 --> 18:47.044

Squirrel wings!

‐ Did you guys know there's
a hidden passageway back here?

19:17.157 --> 19:20.911
‐ Grab whatever's not nailed down
and follow us.

19:21.620 --> 19:22.538
‐ Hmm.

19:22.538 --> 19:23.956
Hmm?

‐ Yes!

I want you to know,
you're like the son I never had.

19:48.856 --> 19:50.732
‐ Thank you, Sire.

19:50.732 --> 19:54.111
‐ I should specify: the son I never had,
that I am aware of.

19:54.111 --> 19:55.153
‐ Right.

19:55.153 --> 19:57.447

You're alive!

doesn't mean I'm not thrilled.

I'm‐I'm‐I'm thrilled.

20:45.913 --> 20:49.499
Do not drink the moat water.

20:49.499 --> 20:52.669
It links directly to the sewage system.

21:00.677 --> 21:02.846

21:02.846 --> 21:04.306
You're supposed to protect me.

21:04.306 --> 21:08.644
‐ Oh, whoops.
You should probably fire us.

21:08.644 --> 21:09.895
‐ No way.

21:09.895 --> 21:12.356
God as my witness, Human Shield,

21:12.356 --> 21:14.816
you will die protecting me.

Oh my god.

Today was a disaster.

21:32.125 --> 21:33.210
‐ Eh, maybe.

21:33.210 --> 21:35.128
But you should be proud
of yourself, Patrick.
