00:40.240 --> 00:41.844
<i>I had sex today.</i>

00:43.200 --> 00:44.725
<i>Holy shit.</i>

00:45.800 --> 00:49.486
<i>All my life I'm looking for the magic</i>

00:49.560 --> 00:53.645
<i>I've been looking for the magic</i>

00:56.720 --> 01:00.281
<i>Fantasize on a silly little tragic</i>

01:00.360 --> 01:04.206
<i>I've been looking for the magic</i>

01:04.400 --> 01:08.086
<i>In my eyes</i>

01:08.720 --> 01:11.644
<i>Oh, oh, oh, I'm</i>

01:12.880 --> 01:19.729
<i>Looking for the magic in my eyes</i>

01:20.640 --> 01:22.642
<i>In my eyes</i>

01:23.640 --> 01:25.768
<i>Baby in my eyes</i>

01:28.680 --> 01:31.650
<i>Oh, oh, oh, I'm</i>

01:32.840 --> 01:39.644
<i>Looking for the magic in my eyes</i>

01:40.440 --> 01:42.329
<i>In my eyes</i>

01:43.520 --> 01:45.761
<i>Baby in your eyes</i>

01:46.680 --> 01:49.889
<i>Oh, oh, in your eyes</i>

01:50.680 --> 01:52.887
<i>Baby in your eyes</i>

02:04.000 --> 02:05.604
My name is Minnie Goetze.

02:05.680 --> 02:09.048
I'm a 15-year-old living in
San Francisco, California,

02:09.120 --> 02:10.883
recording this onto a cassette tape

02:10.960 --> 02:13.566
because my life has gotten
really crazy of late,

02:13.640 --> 02:15.563
and I need to tell someone about it.

02:16.520 --> 02:19.922
If you're listening to this
without my permission, please stop now.

02:20.240 --> 02:23.722
Just stop. Okay?

02:26.480 --> 02:27.891
So...

02:30.400 --> 02:32.482
I don't remember being born.

02:35.240 --> 02:37.402
I was a very ugly child.

02:41.240 --> 02:43.004
My appearance has not improved,

02:43.080 --> 02:47.130
so I suppose it was a lucky break
when he was attracted by my youthfulness.

02:48.560 --> 02:52.007
Hey, Domino, you stupid cat, I love you.

02:52.080 --> 02:55.482
Hey, Domino, do I look different
than I did yesterday?

02:59.920 --> 03:03.163
In all matter of factuality,
it happened like this...

03:05.840 --> 03:08.207
<i>I was wearing a ratty old nightgown,</i>

03:08.280 --> 03:10.521
<i>which is embarrassing
when I think about it,</i>

03:10.600 --> 03:13.763
<i>but I'm not gonna change that detail
'cause it's the truth.</i>

03:15.120 --> 03:18.761
<i>My mother was married for a long time
to my stepdad Pascal.</i>

03:18.840 --> 03:21.286
<i>He's a science-y guy. A PhD.</i>

03:22.800 --> 03:24.882
<i>He has a lot of ideas
about how the world works.</i>

03:25.280 --> 03:27.362
<i>Doesn't think women should drink or smoke.</i>

03:27.440 --> 03:30.523
Mom! You're so gross.
I can't even watch TV without you...

03:36.640 --> 03:38.921
<i>Maybe that's why
she isn't married to him anymore.</i>

03:38.960 --> 03:39.961
Wait.

03:40.040 --> 03:41.883
<i>She's looser now.</i>

03:41.960 --> 03:43.883
- You really...
- Cocaine.

03:43.960 --> 03:45.689
What's his last name?

03:45.760 --> 03:47.600
I thought you were gonna...

03:48.800 --> 03:52.168
<i>Monroe is her boyfriend,
but they aren't possessive.</i>

03:52.560 --> 03:55.723
I'm going to bed. I'm tired.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.570
I'm crashing, you guys.

04:00.640 --> 04:03.120
All right. Good night.

04:03.200 --> 04:04.725
- Good night.
- Good night.

04:39.520 --> 04:43.570
<i>I know it seems weird,
but I had this strangely calming feeling</i>

04:43.640 --> 04:45.802
<i>that even if he meant to touch my tit,</i>

04:45.880 --> 04:47.928
<i>it's probably all right,
because he's a good guy,</i>

04:48.000 --> 04:50.162
<i>and he knows how it goes and I don't.</i>

04:55.320 --> 04:57.846
<i>But I wonder if my breast felt small.</i>

05:08.880 --> 05:12.248
Oh, Monroe. Pitter-pat.

05:13.200 --> 05:17.250
You touched my tit. How was that?

05:20.480 --> 05:22.642
Can I just say, um...

05:23.880 --> 05:27.566
Touching your breasts was, um...

05:31.160 --> 05:32.161
I can't even say it.

05:34.120 --> 05:35.963
They're really great, Minnie.

05:36.080 --> 05:41.883
Fantastic breasts. Just perfect.

05:46.280 --> 05:47.520
Weirdo.

05:50.840 --> 05:54.447
<i>It feels so good to imagine that
he might be thinking about me.</i>

05:56.680 --> 05:58.125
<i>Not that I love him or anything.</i>

05:59.720 --> 06:01.404
<i>I'm not stupid.</i>

06:02.760 --> 06:03.966
Mmm.

06:04.920 --> 06:07.160
- You about ready, steady?
- No, I don't think I wanna go.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.850
I'm already in my skivvies.

06:09.520 --> 06:10.931
It's two-for-one Tuesdays.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.445
We're gonna watch
<i>Little House on the Prairie.</i>

06:12.520 --> 06:15.444
- Yeah.
- No, no, no, come on. You promised.

06:15.560 --> 06:17.289
I know. I'm sorry, baby.

06:17.840 --> 06:19.365
- Just for a couple of drinks.
- No.

06:19.480 --> 06:20.606
I need to get out.

06:20.680 --> 06:23.160
I will make it up to you, I promise.
I'm sorry.

06:25.160 --> 06:26.161
Come on.

06:26.280 --> 06:27.884
Why don't you take Minnie?

06:27.960 --> 06:29.121
What?

06:29.640 --> 06:31.085
- Yeah.
- No.

06:31.200 --> 06:32.690
Minnie will go. Won't you, Min?

06:32.800 --> 06:35.565
- She doesn't want to go.
- Yeah, I do. Where?

06:36.560 --> 06:38.244
See? Told ya.

06:49.760 --> 06:51.171
Worthless.

06:51.840 --> 06:52.841
It was good.

06:52.920 --> 06:56.641
It was not good. This is good.

06:59.320 --> 07:01.721
Oh, man. I got it.

07:03.160 --> 07:04.161
I got it.

07:06.840 --> 07:08.729
- Oh, shut up. Shut up.
- Ow! Ow!

07:08.840 --> 07:11.047
- Gosh, you're such a lightweight.
- Ow.

07:11.120 --> 07:12.167
No. Ow.

07:16.840 --> 07:18.410
- That doesn't hurt?
- What are you trying to do?

07:18.480 --> 07:19.891
You're not even biting me.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.002
I'm gonna bite you so fucking hard.

07:24.680 --> 07:27.570
Are you even biting down?
I'm not feeling it.

07:28.680 --> 07:30.887
- You're drunk.
- No, I'm not drunk.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.846
I'm just really strong,
and my fists are made of steel, that's why.

07:35.760 --> 07:37.649
I feel nothing. Nothing.

07:38.360 --> 07:40.044
You're not even biting.

08:11.920 --> 08:13.570
You're far away.

08:17.440 --> 08:19.488
You just gave me a hard-on.

08:26.680 --> 08:28.045
I did?

08:32.240 --> 08:34.082
Yeah, I'm hard.

08:46.120 --> 08:47.645
You don't believe me?

08:51.800 --> 08:52.801
It's hard.

08:54.280 --> 08:55.441
See?

09:02.680 --> 09:06.526
<i>It didn't feel too hard to me.
It was still skin.</i>

09:12.840 --> 09:15.286
I want you to fuck me.

09:19.520 --> 09:21.966
All right. You're shit-faced, Minnie.

09:22.480 --> 09:23.641
Come on.

09:32.320 --> 09:34.846
I can't believe you said
you want me to fuck you.

09:36.600 --> 09:38.648
Do you really want me to fuck you?

09:40.800 --> 09:43.007
None of your fucking business.

09:51.640 --> 09:54.007
You really do want me to fuck you,
don't you?

09:58.720 --> 10:05.046
You really fucking want me to
fucking fuck you.

10:16.520 --> 10:19.444
<i>I didn't know if I wanted him
or anyone else to fuck me,</i>

10:19.520 --> 10:22.888
<i>but I was afraid to pass up the chance
'cause I may never get another.</i>

10:35.280 --> 10:37.726
<i>The inside of his mouth was all smooth.</i>

10:38.280 --> 10:40.760
<i>I tried giving him a blow job in the car.</i>

10:41.240 --> 10:43.720
<i>He said he wants to fuck me,
but we can't tonight.</i>

10:44.640 --> 10:46.130
Oh, my God.

10:46.880 --> 10:50.089
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

10:59.560 --> 11:02.530
<i>Is this what it feels like
for someone to love you?</i>

11:06.280 --> 11:07.964
<i>Somebody wants me.</i>

11:09.000 --> 11:13.005
<i>Somebody wants to have sex with me.</i>

11:39.360 --> 11:40.361
Hey.

11:41.080 --> 11:43.003
You gonna get in trouble
for skipping school?

11:43.080 --> 11:44.081
No.

11:44.880 --> 11:46.769
- You feel like sandwiches?
- Yeah.

13:24.440 --> 13:25.566
What?

13:27.480 --> 13:29.960
I didn't know you were a virgin.

13:39.720 --> 13:41.245
You look good.

13:46.360 --> 13:48.044
Will you take my picture?

13:48.440 --> 13:49.441
Why?

13:53.080 --> 13:56.163
Please. I just wanna see.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.923
No, no, no. Are you crazy?

14:27.760 --> 14:29.762
You better not show that to anyone.

14:32.440 --> 14:34.249
Can't even see where I am.

14:35.880 --> 14:39.851
<i>Ms. Hearst is still being examined by
Dr. William Sargent, a brainwash expert</i>

14:39.920 --> 14:42.002
<i>flown in from London
at her parents' expense.</i>

14:42.080 --> 14:43.120
<i>Findings had no bearing...</i>

14:43.160 --> 14:44.844
Minnie, Minnie, come watch with us.

14:44.920 --> 14:46.604
Yeah, it's history in the making.

14:46.680 --> 14:48.569
<i>...by a bank camera
taking part in an armed robbery...</i>

14:48.640 --> 14:51.564
Oh, she's not mentally ill. Fuck this guy.

14:51.640 --> 14:54.689
Just because she left her bourgeois family
to start over.

14:54.760 --> 14:56.444
I know how you feel, Patty.

14:57.200 --> 15:00.283
What kind of person falls in love
with the people who kidnap them?

15:00.360 --> 15:01.600
<i>...move her trial date back.</i>

15:01.680 --> 15:04.411
<i>But when her trial does begin in January,
there's a good possibility</i>

15:04.480 --> 15:05.720
<i>Dr. Sargent will then be called...</i>

15:05.840 --> 15:07.046
Is that what you wore today?

15:07.120 --> 15:08.485
Mom.

15:09.160 --> 15:12.403
I'm just saying it wouldn't kill you
to show off your waist a little bit.

15:12.480 --> 15:13.481
Geez.

15:18.440 --> 15:22.604
<i>I had sex today. Holy shit.</i>

15:30.000 --> 15:31.570
That was about an hour ago,

15:31.640 --> 15:34.325
and now I can't believe
I've actually said it out loud.

15:35.440 --> 15:39.331
I think this makes me officially an adult.

15:40.240 --> 15:41.241
Right?

15:46.120 --> 15:47.121
<i>All right, tell me.</i>

15:47.200 --> 15:48.645
I can't tell you, you have to guess.

15:48.880 --> 15:50.211
<i>You fucked somebody.</i>

15:50.280 --> 15:52.362
What? How did you know?

15:52.720 --> 15:55.200
I'm so happy. Who was it?

15:55.320 --> 15:57.766
Guess. Gretel is listening.

15:57.840 --> 15:59.808
I am not. You're so full of yourself.

15:59.880 --> 16:02.884
Wait. Was it that guy that works
at the liquor store, the cute one?

16:02.960 --> 16:04.485
<i>No.</i>

16:04.560 --> 16:06.164
Was it someone I know?

16:06.560 --> 16:08.369
Yes.

16:09.040 --> 16:11.725
Wait a minute. It's not Monroe, is it?

16:13.920 --> 16:16.605
<i>My God, Minnie, that is so sick.</i>

16:16.960 --> 16:18.007
Ew.

16:18.240 --> 16:19.890
Don't you think he's kind of cute?

16:19.960 --> 16:23.601
<i>No, I do not think he's cute. He's so old.
Ew, ew, ew.</i>

16:23.720 --> 16:25.370
Minnie, he sleeps with your mom.

16:25.480 --> 16:28.927
Only 'cause he has to,
otherwise she'll suspect something.

16:29.120 --> 16:30.406
<i>I don't know, Minnie.</i>

16:30.480 --> 16:33.241
<i>Don't you kind of feel like
he's taking advantage of you or something?</i>

16:33.880 --> 16:36.167
<i>I mean, you're so much younger than him.</i>

16:39.240 --> 16:40.810
<i>Minnie?</i>

16:43.760 --> 16:45.842
I'm gonna kill you!

16:45.920 --> 16:47.206
Minnie, don't!

16:47.600 --> 16:50.171
Quit spying on me!

16:50.240 --> 16:51.924
What were you talking about?

16:55.080 --> 16:59.529
<i>What did you dream about last night?</i>

16:59.720 --> 17:03.884
<i>How did you feel
when you woke up today?</i>

17:04.119 --> 17:08.682
<i>I had a dream about you last night</i>

17:08.760 --> 17:10.967
<i>Why do they always end the same way?</i>

17:18.640 --> 17:19.641
Hey.

17:21.200 --> 17:22.201
Hey.

17:23.240 --> 17:25.810
- Is your mom home?
- No.

17:26.680 --> 17:28.522
Why? Did you come to see her?

17:29.120 --> 17:31.361
No. I came to see you, silly.

17:31.520 --> 17:32.806
Oh.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.490
Ow.

17:36.120 --> 17:37.804
You got a pretty good arm.

17:38.800 --> 17:39.801
Wanna box?

17:41.120 --> 17:43.043
- Yeah.
- Well...

17:44.680 --> 17:48.048
Really? Come on then.

17:54.520 --> 17:56.648
What were you doing before I got here?

17:56.800 --> 17:59.201
- Nothing.
- Were you thinking about me?

17:59.280 --> 18:01.169
- No.
- No?

18:03.480 --> 18:05.721
- Min, I think you were.
- Hello!

18:06.760 --> 18:09.491
Hey. There you are.

18:11.840 --> 18:13.251
Let me get those.

18:13.360 --> 18:15.931
Thank you. Hey, you look cute.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.331
- Hey.
- Hi.

18:21.880 --> 18:24.451
<i>What's the point of living
if nobody loves you?</i>

18:26.480 --> 18:28.369
<i>Nobody sees you.</i>

18:29.600 --> 18:31.250
<i>Nobody touches you.</i>

18:38.240 --> 18:40.242
<i>I wish I were older than I am.</i>

18:41.920 --> 18:43.365
<i>I'm so alone.</i>

18:52.560 --> 18:56.042
<i>It feels like there are little weights
hanging from my heart</i>

18:56.120 --> 18:58.726
<i>that swing and tug every time I move,</i>

18:59.440 --> 19:01.044
<i>every time the wind blows.</i>

19:04.720 --> 19:07.371
<i>I want someone to be
so totally in love with me</i>

19:07.440 --> 19:11.081
<i>that they would feel like they would die
if I were gone.</i>

19:14.080 --> 19:16.526
<i>Maybe Monroe could love me like that.</i>

19:20.840 --> 19:22.683
What's your favorite color?

19:24.720 --> 19:26.131
I don't know.

19:28.360 --> 19:29.361
Blue.

19:30.600 --> 19:32.921
Why are you asking me
such stupid questions?

19:38.680 --> 19:40.045
<i>Or maybe not.</i>

19:41.880 --> 19:44.167
<i>I am so warm all over.</i>

19:46.600 --> 19:50.969
<i>I want a body pressed up next to me
so that I know that I'm really here.</i>

20:00.280 --> 20:02.851
<i>Mom and Andrea got some coke
from Michael Cocaine</i>

20:02.920 --> 20:05.890
<i>and it gave them the energy
to clean the whole house today.</i>

20:10.760 --> 20:13.366
Hi. Um, we're making dinner right now.

20:13.480 --> 20:16.370
So far, we've got peas that are cooking.
Do you want me to make you some pasta?

20:16.440 --> 20:18.440
What kind of pasta do you like? I forget.
Macaroni.

20:18.560 --> 20:21.882
Do you want me to make you
a little bit of macaroni? Okay.

20:29.760 --> 20:33.082
My mother's friend, Martin Chong,
wrote her a poem.

20:33.760 --> 20:36.206
He's one of the many men
who's in love with her.

20:36.800 --> 20:41.124
Waiting in line with a number in their hand
like at the deli counter.

20:43.640 --> 20:46.041
He wrote it on a lacy purple
piece of rice paper

20:46.120 --> 20:48.168
that I found crumpled in the trash.

20:49.040 --> 20:50.451
I think it's beautiful.

20:52.880 --> 20:55.884
"It would've been better to
have slept and dreamed

20:56.400 --> 21:00.564
"than to watch the night pass
and the slow moon sink."

21:06.080 --> 21:10.130
I wonder if Monroe is masturbating
thinking about me tonight.

21:10.680 --> 21:14.127
Monroe says I exude sexuality.

21:15.800 --> 21:20.203
Sometimes, I look in the mirror
and I can't believe what I see.

21:21.680 --> 21:25.241
I just realized I've had breasts
for three full years now.

21:36.640 --> 21:38.563
He's fucked me seven times now.

21:39.040 --> 21:41.247
All I can think about is the fucking.

21:41.920 --> 21:44.890
Monroe is a good lay
from what I know in my limited knowledge.

21:46.760 --> 21:48.808
He is very tall and strong

21:48.880 --> 21:53.090
and has two strong muscular thighs
and a big manly chest.

21:56.560 --> 21:59.404
As for myself,
I'm not really attractive at all.

21:59.760 --> 22:02.047
But I do think I look different now.

22:02.720 --> 22:04.051
Probably my aura.

22:04.960 --> 22:06.962
And I think people are noticing.

22:08.920 --> 22:10.410
But what do we make
of the moment

22:10.480 --> 22:13.086
when he touches Holden's forehead
while he slept?

22:13.840 --> 22:16.810
Holden's attitudes about homosexuality
come into question

22:16.880 --> 22:19.281
as do his ability of perception.

22:19.880 --> 22:22.929
Is there something questionable going on,

22:23.000 --> 22:24.843
or is that all in Holden's mind?

22:25.920 --> 22:27.809
<i>That's why I</i>

22:30.600 --> 22:33.922
<i>I don't cry</i>

22:35.520 --> 22:38.444
<i>That's why I</i>

22:40.160 --> 22:43.050
<i>I don't cry</i>

22:50.800 --> 22:53.929
<i>Laughing</i>

22:55.440 --> 22:59.684
<i>Laughing sometimes does somebody
some good somehow</i>

23:04.400 --> 23:05.731
That's why I...

23:05.920 --> 23:08.241
Even if she knew
what she was doing in the bank,

23:08.320 --> 23:09.481
she was a prisoner.

23:12.480 --> 23:15.768
Kidnapped, raped. Come on, she's a victim.

23:16.840 --> 23:18.888
Mmm, I don't know.

23:19.960 --> 23:23.009
I guess it does seem kind of
counter-progressive or something.

23:23.520 --> 23:27.923
It's bullshit.
It's fascist, misogynistic bullshit.

23:29.400 --> 23:31.402
Hmm.

23:31.560 --> 23:34.131
You know, you should really pay attention
to this kind of stuff.

23:34.200 --> 23:36.089
Read a newspaper once in a while.

23:36.160 --> 23:37.685
Yeah, you've said that.

23:42.520 --> 23:44.363
I'm gonna get some ice.

24:04.960 --> 24:06.689
Your mom's really gorgeous.

24:07.520 --> 24:09.522
I don't know. I guess.

24:11.080 --> 24:13.606
Aren't you afraid she's gonna find out
about you and Monroe?

24:13.720 --> 24:15.848
What if they get married? It's so sick.

24:16.080 --> 24:18.560
Obviously, I can't tell her about,
you know...

24:18.640 --> 24:22.725
I mean, what am I supposed to say?
Mom, I'm sleeping with your boyfriend.

24:24.280 --> 24:25.281
Yeah.

24:25.640 --> 24:27.847
Maybe I'll tell her
when we're both old and gray,

24:27.920 --> 24:30.571
and Monroe is cold in his grave. You know?

24:32.680 --> 24:34.760
Do you think I should start
ironing my hair straight?

24:34.800 --> 24:36.529
Or is it sort of classic like this?

24:41.080 --> 24:43.401
Kimmie's kind of white trash,
don't you think?

24:43.480 --> 24:44.641
She is not.

24:44.720 --> 24:48.247
No, I mean it in a good way.
You know, she's like down-to-earth.

24:49.120 --> 24:52.761
I love her Farrah Fawcett hairdo.
It's so <i>à la mode.</i>

24:53.320 --> 24:57.689
I mean, I'm glad your hair's not like that.
I'm just saying it looks cute on her.

24:58.200 --> 24:59.611
Boys love Kimmie.

25:01.160 --> 25:02.161
Really?

25:05.440 --> 25:06.441
I don't know.

25:07.840 --> 25:11.083
I mean, I think she looks better in pants
than she does in skirts.

25:11.160 --> 25:13.128
Her ankles are sort of thick, I think.

25:13.680 --> 25:14.681
Mom.

25:17.240 --> 25:22.087
I don't want to brag, but I was
quite a piece when I was your age.

25:25.200 --> 25:28.283
I don't know what's wrong with you.
I'd think you'd be more into boys.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.124
Even Gretel has a boyfriend.

25:30.360 --> 25:33.603
I mean, he's just a weird,
little Italian boy in her class, but still.

25:35.040 --> 25:36.451
Don't you like anybody?

25:38.240 --> 25:39.446
You can tell me.

25:41.800 --> 25:44.087
- No.
- No?

25:44.280 --> 25:45.805
Mmm-mmm.

25:48.640 --> 25:53.202
When I was in high school,
well, boys were all over me.

25:55.160 --> 25:56.650
Like my dad?

25:59.160 --> 26:00.207
Yeah.

26:01.320 --> 26:03.482
Yeah, your dad and I
were crazy about each other.

26:04.800 --> 26:06.484
He wasn't messed up then.

26:08.360 --> 26:14.322
I mean, he was just a wannabe artist
with a fuck-the-world attitude.

26:15.840 --> 26:18.491
And he rode a Triumph Blackbird.

26:18.560 --> 26:21.803
Have I ever told you that?
Fuck, it was fantastic.

26:23.200 --> 26:25.601
And my parents hated him. It was so hot.

26:30.680 --> 26:33.365
You know, you're not gonna have
that bod forever, Min.

26:33.960 --> 26:36.440
I know that's not very
feminist of me to say,

26:36.520 --> 26:39.444
but you might be happier if you put
it out there a little bit, you know?

26:39.520 --> 26:41.966
Wear some makeup?
Wear a skirt once in a while?

26:42.040 --> 26:45.203
Jesus. Get some attention.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.367
You have a kind of power, you know.
You just...

26:51.280 --> 26:52.964
You don't know it yet.

27:01.200 --> 27:03.360
No, no, no, no, no. Keep going.

27:03.880 --> 27:06.008
Keep going. Keep going.

27:06.560 --> 27:08.369
Oh, come on. Come on.

27:14.760 --> 27:16.524
We have to stop this.

27:19.320 --> 27:21.004
Why would you say that?

27:22.720 --> 27:24.210
Do you think I'm fat?

27:27.120 --> 27:32.081
You're so fucking confusing
with your adult codes and bullshit.

27:32.240 --> 27:33.241
Minnie.

27:33.320 --> 27:36.563
I'm used to the more honest means
of communication used between children.

27:36.640 --> 27:38.483
You know, I'm almost still a child.
You know?

27:38.560 --> 27:40.005
Yeah, I know that.

27:40.840 --> 27:42.842
That's why I said we have to stop.

27:46.120 --> 27:50.091
I don't know what it is.
You have some kind of hold on me.

27:52.800 --> 27:54.484
But I don't want it to stop.

28:05.440 --> 28:07.602
<i>Maybe I should
just ignore everything.</i>

28:08.960 --> 28:12.487
<i>But I like sex. I wanna get laid right now.</i>

28:19.600 --> 28:21.489
<i>I really like getting fucked.</i>

28:21.760 --> 28:24.127
<i>Does everyone think about fucking
as much as I do?</i>

28:29.880 --> 28:31.484
That's Aline Kominsky, man.

28:34.640 --> 28:35.801
It's good shit.

28:36.800 --> 28:39.963
Check it out, Girl Scout. Expand your mind.

28:49.760 --> 28:52.764
<i>I've decided, Aline Kominsky
is my favorite cartoonist.</i>

28:53.800 --> 28:57.850
<i>She must be beautiful and work all the time
at a little drawing table</i>

28:57.960 --> 29:00.361
<i>with R. Crumb nearby at his drawing table.</i>

29:00.640 --> 29:03.484
<i>And they discuss their drawings
and their pens.</i>

29:08.200 --> 29:09.884
<i>I imagine they're happy.</i>

29:10.960 --> 29:13.122
<i>I wish I knew someone who was happy.</i>

29:42.040 --> 29:44.646
<i>I feel like all of Monroe's
excuses not to come here,</i>

29:44.760 --> 29:46.250
<i>are excuses not to see me.</i>

29:46.920 --> 29:48.888
<i>My mom thinks it's about her.</i>

29:53.360 --> 29:55.886
<i>"Dear Monroe, I know you think I'm fat.</i>

29:55.960 --> 29:57.689
<i>"But I don't care, because I know that</i>

29:57.760 --> 30:01.003
<i>"black guys, the world over,
and also Italian construction workers</i>

30:01.080 --> 30:04.721
<i>"and wetbacks and old men
and also some lesbians like fat girls,</i>

30:04.800 --> 30:06.802
<i>"even if you don't, so there.</i>

30:06.880 --> 30:08.450
<i>"Love, Little Minnie."</i>

30:20.360 --> 30:26.242
<i>Heading out this morning into the sun</i>

30:28.840 --> 30:34.927
<i>Riding on the diamond waves,
little darlin' one</i>

30:37.080 --> 30:40.880
<i>Warm wind caress her</i>

30:41.080 --> 30:45.369
<i>Her lover it seems</i>

30:45.440 --> 30:47.010
<i>Oh, Annie</i>

30:47.080 --> 30:49.128
<i>Dreamboat Annie...</i>

30:52.560 --> 30:54.289
- Hello?
<i>- Minnie.</i>

30:55.400 --> 30:56.481
Pascal.

30:56.560 --> 30:59.245
- Don't sound so excited.
<i>- Sony.</i>

30:59.920 --> 31:01.763
Uh, you get that biology test back?

31:03.080 --> 31:04.320
B-minus.

31:05.040 --> 31:06.883
<i>And are we happy with that?</i>

31:08.000 --> 31:09.445
How's New York?

31:09.560 --> 31:11.767
<i>You would love it here.</i>

31:12.960 --> 31:15.964
The libraries alone
elevate it far above San Francisco.

31:17.240 --> 31:18.526
Sounds cool.

31:19.040 --> 31:22.886
<i>New York City, it's such a great place
for a young lady.</i>

31:22.960 --> 31:24.644
<i>You could live with me.</i>

31:26.280 --> 31:27.884
I was your surrogate father for years,
and, you know,

31:27.960 --> 31:30.960
that doesn't end just because your mother
and I are no longer legally bound.

31:33.320 --> 31:36.483
I am gonna send you a book on flies.

31:38.680 --> 31:40.967
<i>Uh, where's your mother?</i>

31:41.040 --> 31:43.168
I don't know. She's not back from work yet.

31:44.040 --> 31:45.644
<i>Is she coming home today?</i>

31:46.440 --> 31:48.568
I guess. She didn't say she wasn't.

31:48.640 --> 31:51.849
She usually finishes at the library
around 6:00.

31:52.520 --> 31:54.124
<i>So, who's she going out with these days?</i>

31:54.720 --> 31:58.770
I didn't say she was going out with anyone.
You don't even listen to me, Pascal.

31:58.840 --> 32:00.490
That's not true, Minnie.

32:01.000 --> 32:05.210
Besides, Mom isn't even really partying.
She's like a monk or a nun or whatever.

32:06.760 --> 32:08.720
<i>Well, don't tell her I was asking about her,
okay?</i>

32:08.760 --> 32:11.570
<i>It'd just complicate
things between she and I.</i>

32:11.840 --> 32:14.241
<i>I just finished</i> The Final Days.

32:18.360 --> 32:21.045
<i>"Dear Aline Kominsky. Hello.</i>

32:21.120 --> 32:24.329
<i>"My name is Minnie Goetze,
and I'm an aspiring cartoonist.</i>

32:24.400 --> 32:26.084
<i>"I'm a huge fan of yours.</i>

32:26.160 --> 32:30.802
<i>"Most cartoons don't amuse me at all,
but I absolutely love yours.</i>

32:31.360 --> 32:34.807
<i>"I just completed my first real comic.
It's only one page.</i>

32:34.880 --> 32:37.042
<i>"It's about walking around in the city.</i>

32:38.760 --> 32:42.367
<i>"I used india ink,
but I wasn't sure what kind of paper to use.</i>

32:42.480 --> 32:46.041
<i>"What do you use?
With admiration, Minnie Goetze."</i>

32:50.840 --> 32:53.411
It stirs up a kind of
frustrated passion in my heart

32:53.480 --> 32:55.323
to think about Monroe sometimes.

32:55.400 --> 32:57.721
To think about him out with my mother.

33:08.720 --> 33:10.688
- Careful.
- Fine.

33:12.120 --> 33:13.281
Where're you going?

33:13.360 --> 33:14.521
Just one, sir.

33:15.920 --> 33:19.606
No. No, no, no.
Don't be such a drag.

33:19.800 --> 33:21.689
We haven't even sung to you yet.

33:21.760 --> 33:23.040
- I'm tired.
- Come on.

33:23.080 --> 33:24.491
No, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.

33:24.560 --> 33:29.691
All right, I'm gonna make another toast,
toast from... For his birthday.

33:30.960 --> 33:33.691
To Monroe's birthday.

33:34.320 --> 33:37.369
It will never get better than this.

33:38.840 --> 33:39.921
What?

33:40.600 --> 33:43.604
It's never gonna get any better than 35.

33:43.880 --> 33:45.120
Kill me.

33:49.200 --> 33:52.249
- Happy birthday.
- No. Happy birthday.

33:53.040 --> 33:56.362
- It's not my birthday.
- No? But it's your...

33:56.440 --> 33:57.805
Mmm.

33:57.960 --> 34:01.009
- You're such a fucking good woman.
- Mmm.

34:01.160 --> 34:03.640
There aren't enough women like you
in California.

34:03.720 --> 34:05.290
- Thank you.
- Right, Burt?

34:05.360 --> 34:07.522
- Right, Burt? Right, Burt?
- That's right.

34:11.600 --> 34:14.922
Oh, Minnie! Guys, Minnie's here!

34:18.320 --> 34:20.482
Such a good little shit.

34:22.760 --> 34:24.091
Minnie, come.

34:25.400 --> 34:27.083
It's my birthday.

34:27.360 --> 34:29.248
<i>...runway number five</i>

34:29.360 --> 34:32.920
<i>Next plane to London and I'm missin' him</i>

34:33.880 --> 34:34.960
To Minnie.

34:36.320 --> 34:39.483
She's such a great kid.

34:41.159 --> 34:43.447
- To Minnie.
- To Minnie.

34:45.120 --> 34:49.170
<i>Only hope by leavin'
I don't break his heart...</i>

35:02.600 --> 35:05.444
<i>I wonder if anybody loves me
who I don't know about.</i>

35:13.040 --> 35:15.122
- Hey, Minnie.
- Hey, Chuck.

35:16.360 --> 35:20.763
I heard you got put on academic probation.
You might get kicked out.

35:21.520 --> 35:22.521
Yeah.

35:23.080 --> 35:24.081
Bogue.

35:24.520 --> 35:25.885
I don't care.

35:26.280 --> 35:31.047
I wanna be an artist, anyway,
so school is essentially pointless for me.

35:33.520 --> 35:35.045
- I'll be right back.
- Uh...

35:40.720 --> 35:41.721
Slut.

35:45.600 --> 35:47.204
If it isn't, <i>mon chéri.</i>

35:48.240 --> 35:49.890
What are you doing right now?

35:57.080 --> 36:00.084
What are you waiting for? Don't be scared.

36:15.040 --> 36:16.041
Hold on.

36:16.160 --> 36:19.004
Let's turn over. Turn. Just turn.

36:19.080 --> 36:20.081
Okay.

36:31.480 --> 36:33.448
See? See, slower.

36:48.800 --> 36:50.928
<i>Like a precious star</i>

36:53.200 --> 36:56.044
<i>Ooh, like a precious star you are</i>

36:57.200 --> 37:00.124
<i>Ooh, like a precious star you are</i>

37:00.840 --> 37:04.481
<i>I wanna spend my life with you</i>

37:05.320 --> 37:08.290
<i>Ooh, like a precious star you are</i>

37:08.840 --> 37:11.241
<i>And will you love me</i>

37:12.000 --> 37:14.321
<i>Like you said when we met child</i>

37:17.320 --> 37:20.483
<i>Ooh, like a precious star you are</i>

37:22.320 --> 37:23.560
Come on, fat ass.

37:25.320 --> 37:28.164
<i>Ooh, like the silver moon above</i>

37:29.400 --> 37:32.722
<i>Is the night right for love</i>

37:34.000 --> 37:35.843
Are we gonna go to your place?

37:35.920 --> 37:37.729
I thought you wanted to
look at boats with me.

37:37.800 --> 37:39.848
Well, yeah, I do.

37:40.400 --> 37:42.641
But then are we gonna go to your place?

37:42.920 --> 37:45.526
What are you?
Some kind of nympho or something?

37:45.720 --> 37:49.202
No. Fuck you. You're so disgusting.

37:49.960 --> 37:52.327
I don't even know
why you brought me here.

37:53.280 --> 37:54.281
Come on.

37:56.400 --> 37:59.006
Don't get nervous in the service, okay?

37:59.120 --> 38:01.361
We're just gonna look at
this boat real quick.

38:03.480 --> 38:04.686
You look nice today.

38:05.720 --> 38:06.721
What?

38:07.120 --> 38:08.281
You look pretty.

38:09.800 --> 38:11.131
And you're not fat.

38:12.360 --> 38:14.283
You know, you have a great body.

38:14.720 --> 38:16.210
I do not.

38:16.680 --> 38:19.126
Come on aboard, take a look around.

38:19.720 --> 38:21.484
- I'll wait for you up on the dock.
- Thank you, sir.

38:21.560 --> 38:23.005
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

38:27.240 --> 38:28.401
Whoo!

38:28.520 --> 38:29.885
Freeport style!

38:30.400 --> 38:33.563
- I dig it. It's nice, huh?
- I guess.

38:37.400 --> 38:39.323
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

38:44.240 --> 38:45.960
So, you wanna take a trip around the world?

38:48.000 --> 38:49.490
You can be my first mate.

38:50.560 --> 38:51.561
Like Gilligan?

38:52.760 --> 38:54.046
Like Gilligan.

38:54.880 --> 38:58.168
I'll put you to work in the galley.
Get a little cat for the ship.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.490
It's like a little house.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.764
Are you really gonna get it?

39:03.840 --> 39:04.841
Mmm.

39:05.800 --> 39:07.564
I kind of wish it was blue.

39:08.280 --> 39:10.965
Yeah, me, too.

39:11.800 --> 39:14.201
Yeah, but I really am gonna
get a boat, though.

39:14.280 --> 39:16.886
I just have to wait
till my vitamin business takes off.

39:17.280 --> 39:19.760
See, I'm gonna build up
this mail order empire.

39:21.120 --> 39:24.647
And then I'll retire when I'm 45,
just sell it all.

39:26.200 --> 39:27.201
Get my boat.

39:29.640 --> 39:31.802
Become the captain of my own destiny.

39:34.200 --> 39:36.089
- Wait. Minnie, Minnie.
- What?

39:36.160 --> 39:37.730
We gotta lay low.

39:38.280 --> 39:40.248
You draw too much attention to us.

39:41.160 --> 39:43.322
- I can do what I want.
- No.

39:46.560 --> 39:47.561
Stop it.

39:47.840 --> 39:50.571
- You afraid the sailor is gonna hear us?
- No.

39:50.640 --> 39:51.641
You chicken?

39:53.480 --> 39:54.481
I warned you.

39:57.720 --> 39:59.802
Someone is asking for it, huh?

40:00.160 --> 40:02.481
You need to be

40:04.040 --> 40:05.166
restrained!

40:06.200 --> 40:08.282
Don't touch me, you big, fat lout!

40:15.680 --> 40:19.890
You're getting feisty, huh!
Stop wiggling, woman!

40:21.520 --> 40:22.521
God!

40:25.360 --> 40:27.931
Oh, yeah? Is this what you want?

40:28.000 --> 40:30.606
Help! Help, I'm being raped!

41:21.760 --> 41:24.366
I don't think you should
show these to anyone.

41:26.240 --> 41:27.366
Why?

41:31.040 --> 41:33.202
Well, they're gonna weird people out.

41:35.200 --> 41:36.565
They're kind of freaky.

41:39.080 --> 41:41.003
Are these supposed to be sexy?

41:48.720 --> 41:50.609
All right, I gotta take you home.

41:51.440 --> 41:53.488
- No.
- Yes.

41:53.560 --> 41:56.245
No. No, no, no. I don't wanna go yet.

41:56.320 --> 41:57.731
Well, it's time.

41:59.360 --> 42:00.361
Come on.

42:04.560 --> 42:06.528
Why are you trying to get rid of me?

42:07.640 --> 42:09.324
Oh, my God.

42:11.600 --> 42:13.011
It's not fair.

42:14.360 --> 42:16.203
I never see you.

42:22.640 --> 42:26.167
I am gonna run outside completely naked.

42:26.320 --> 42:28.322
I bet your neighbor will see me.

42:28.800 --> 42:30.723
Stop. It's not funny.

42:38.320 --> 42:39.321
No.

42:40.800 --> 42:41.800
Yes.

42:41.840 --> 42:44.844
Will you tell me about your parents?

42:45.320 --> 42:47.129
- No.
- Please.

42:47.200 --> 42:49.567
You tell my mother everything
about your life.

42:49.640 --> 42:51.449
Minnie, you're fucking hyper.

42:52.480 --> 42:55.484
I gotta take you home. It's late.

42:56.560 --> 42:59.484
Hey. Come back here.

43:01.320 --> 43:02.481
Hey!

43:06.920 --> 43:09.924
I think we need to
talk about our relationship.

43:12.360 --> 43:13.566
Oh, really?

43:14.640 --> 43:16.005
I'm serious.

43:16.480 --> 43:17.480
Well, I know you are.

43:17.520 --> 43:21.047
- Don't laugh at me.
- I'm not laughing.

43:21.160 --> 43:22.844
- Don't!
- Ow! I'm not.

43:23.040 --> 43:26.601
Don't... Get your hands off me.
Get your hands off me or...

43:26.680 --> 43:29.331
- Or what?
- Or I'm gonna tell my mother!

43:36.880 --> 43:38.120
Get dressed.

43:41.040 --> 43:42.201
You can't take it?

43:42.280 --> 43:44.487
- Get dressed, I'm taking you home.
- No!

43:44.600 --> 43:46.602
You ruined it, Minnie!

43:48.080 --> 43:50.003
You're a fucking child!

43:50.880 --> 43:53.042
I should tell your mother!

43:53.840 --> 43:55.330
You want that?

43:56.400 --> 43:58.004
You're manipulating me!

43:58.440 --> 44:00.169
Well, I'm not having it!

44:44.720 --> 44:46.245
I hate you.

44:51.200 --> 44:52.964
Yeah, well, I like you.

45:07.240 --> 45:10.164
<i>Fuck Monroe.
He's just a dirty old man.</i>

45:17.080 --> 45:21.005
<i>Down on the street
Where the faces shine</i>

45:24.360 --> 45:28.490
<i>Floatin' around I'm
A real low mind</i>

45:31.320 --> 45:34.005
<i>See a pretty thing</i>

45:35.440 --> 45:37.363
<i>Ain't no wall</i>

45:38.840 --> 45:40.330
<i>No wall</i>

45:40.560 --> 45:42.085
<i>No wall</i>

45:42.520 --> 45:44.010
<i>No wall</i>

45:47.960 --> 45:49.610
Minnie, look at me. Look.

45:49.960 --> 45:50.961
Oh, my God.

45:51.280 --> 45:53.851
Ah! I swear I feel Iggy Pop's dick.
You have to try this.

45:54.360 --> 45:56.567
Okay. All right.

45:58.760 --> 46:01.127
It does feel like
he has a tiny dick in there!

46:01.920 --> 46:03.843
Oh, and it's hard, too.

46:08.640 --> 46:10.244
I would suck Iggy Pop's dick.

46:10.520 --> 46:12.761
Eh. Too gay.

46:12.840 --> 46:15.161
No, he's androgynous. It's hot.

46:16.040 --> 46:18.805
Oh, hey, you know that mixed couple
I babysit for?

46:18.920 --> 46:19.967
Mmm-hmm.

46:20.040 --> 46:22.008
Well, anyway, the dad, Marcus, he's black.

46:22.520 --> 46:23.965
God, I love black guys.

46:24.040 --> 46:27.169
They always look so tough
and smell so gutsy.

46:27.920 --> 46:30.207
I give him blowjobs all the time.

46:31.080 --> 46:32.320
- No way.
- Yeah.

46:32.440 --> 46:33.885
He comes home early from bowling

46:33.960 --> 46:36.281
while his skinny white wife
is still out with her girlfriends,

46:36.360 --> 46:39.443
and I suck his dick
until tears come to my eyes.

46:39.520 --> 46:42.490
I have to rub Vaseline all over my lips,
because his dick is so big,

46:42.560 --> 46:45.086
it feels like my mouth is gonna rip
at the corners.

46:46.720 --> 46:50.850
What? Wait. How big is it, really?

46:54.280 --> 46:56.567
He wants to screw me,
but I'm way too scared.

46:59.760 --> 47:03.287
<i>And now, the making of a harlot.</i>

47:04.560 --> 47:08.724
<i>She was a young girl driven astray
by the lustful lure of the flesh.</i>

47:12.240 --> 47:15.005
<i>She looked every bit the harlot
she was bound to become.</i>

47:15.080 --> 47:17.162
<i>With her brassiere straps exposed,</i>

47:17.240 --> 47:20.608
<i>her tight pants rode up snugly at
the crotch, almost like a horse,</i>

47:20.680 --> 47:22.682
<i>when viewed from behind.</i>

47:26.920 --> 47:31.608
<i>He was a beautiful junior,
rich and famous in high school.</i>

47:31.680 --> 47:34.206
<i>His name? Ricky Wasserman.</i>

47:39.080 --> 47:40.286
What?

47:41.480 --> 47:45.405
It's just so intense.

47:47.880 --> 47:51.771
I mean, there's something
about having sex with you, Minnie,

47:53.080 --> 47:54.809
kind of scares me.

47:55.240 --> 47:57.004
Look, you're just so passionate.

47:57.280 --> 47:58.611
Huh?

47:59.120 --> 48:03.967
I mean, I've just never experienced
someone who has sex like that.

48:05.960 --> 48:06.961
Oh, no!

48:13.720 --> 48:14.801
Mom!

48:15.440 --> 48:16.646
Mom?

48:17.920 --> 48:20.571
Oh, Minnie. Minnie's home.

48:22.000 --> 48:25.368
- Oh, come here. Oh, my girl.
- My girl, girl, girl.

48:26.920 --> 48:29.685
- Andrea, look how pretty she is.
- Yeah.

48:30.320 --> 48:32.322
She's like a little doll.

48:33.920 --> 48:36.526
<i>My mother doesn't touch me
if she can avoid it.</i>

48:37.040 --> 48:41.648
<i>She used to touch me a lot,
in a motherly way, when I was little.</i>

48:42.200 --> 48:43.247
<i>But then...</i>

48:44.880 --> 48:49.442
There's something sexual

48:49.520 --> 48:52.683
about Minnie's need
for physical affection from you.

48:55.600 --> 48:57.125
It's not natural.

48:59.720 --> 49:01.722
Hey! Come on, lazy bones!

49:03.040 --> 49:05.520
<i>What I'm about to do</i>

49:06.120 --> 49:07.281
Help me.

49:08.320 --> 49:10.800
<i>I can't lose with the stuff I use</i>

49:11.360 --> 49:13.408
<i>I got everything</i>

49:14.400 --> 49:17.290
Come on, Minnie.
I wanna dance with you, too.

49:18.400 --> 49:19.640
<i>And if it's good to you</i>

49:19.720 --> 49:22.041
<i>Hey, it's got to be good for you</i>

49:32.600 --> 49:35.524
We should send Minnie out
to go get us some more wine.

49:35.600 --> 49:37.090
We're out of it already?

49:37.520 --> 49:40.808
How long have you been home?
I thought you were working late.

49:42.360 --> 49:44.647
<i>Oh, I'm tough enough to satisfy</i>

49:44.720 --> 49:47.530
<i>I got love good enough to advertise</i>

49:47.720 --> 49:50.724
I got fired from the library,
that's why I'm not working late.

49:51.400 --> 49:52.447
Okay?

49:53.040 --> 49:54.451
Does that make you happy?

49:58.160 --> 50:00.640
Don't worry about it, honey. It's not you.

50:19.360 --> 50:22.762
<i>Baby, if you just say you care</i>

50:22.920 --> 50:26.367
<i>Follow you most anywhere</i>

50:26.560 --> 50:27.971
<i>Roll away the stone</i>

50:28.040 --> 50:31.681
Oh, Miss Thing! You girls look so elegant.
I love your eyes.

50:31.760 --> 50:32.886
Kimmie did us both.

50:32.960 --> 50:35.122
I'll do you, Frankie.
You'll look so hot.

50:35.200 --> 50:36.247
What about you, Chuck?

50:36.320 --> 50:38.800
- Do you wanna get a makeover?
- No.

50:39.280 --> 50:40.964
Is Frankie your boyfriend?

50:41.240 --> 50:42.651
I wouldn't blame you.

50:43.040 --> 50:47.125
- Bitch, you are looking foxy.
- Thanks, baby.

50:48.960 --> 50:50.405
<i>...love again</i>

50:50.480 --> 50:54.485
<i>Roll away the stone
Roll away the stone</i>

50:56.120 --> 50:57.246
Hey.

51:05.520 --> 51:06.806
You're tough.

51:07.360 --> 51:09.727
What are you, a truck driver or something?

51:38.600 --> 51:42.730
I can't believe you smoked pot with Tabatha.
She's so disgusting.

51:42.800 --> 51:45.167
You don't know her. She's cool.

51:46.840 --> 51:48.365
Hey, boys.

51:51.320 --> 51:52.606
Oh, they're cute.

51:53.240 --> 51:55.242
I want them to buy me another drink.

51:55.560 --> 51:59.531
Do you think that they would think
that we're prostitutes?

52:02.040 --> 52:03.804
That would be amazing.

52:04.040 --> 52:06.884
Hookers have all the fucking power.
Everybody knows that.

52:07.040 --> 52:09.520
I've been practicing my prostitute walk.

52:09.640 --> 52:11.085
- Watch.
- Okay.

52:31.480 --> 52:32.481
What happened?

52:32.560 --> 52:34.528
I said it was five bucks
for us to suck their dicks.

52:34.600 --> 52:36.967
Fifteen for the fuck of their fucking lives.

52:37.040 --> 52:38.565
They're counting their money.

52:56.840 --> 52:59.002
I don't think we should have done that.

52:59.920 --> 53:02.287
Yeah, I was just thinking
the same thing.

53:03.280 --> 53:05.681
I feel weird and creepy about it.

53:07.960 --> 53:09.928
Yeah. I do, too.

53:11.160 --> 53:14.687
Maybe we should promise each other
never to do anything like that again.

53:16.040 --> 53:17.246
Agreed.

53:30.920 --> 53:33.924
<i>- Bonjour.</i>
<i>- Bonjour,</i> Pascal.

53:34.800 --> 53:37.201
No, don't you remember
how I taught you how to shake hands?

53:37.280 --> 53:39.328
Come on. You do it firmly.

53:39.760 --> 53:42.923
You look directly in the other man's eyes,
thinking to yourself,

53:43.160 --> 53:45.208
I'm better than you, you son of a bitch.

53:47.920 --> 53:48.921
Let me try.

53:51.960 --> 53:54.042
Bravo, <i>bravissima.</i>

53:54.320 --> 53:56.163
Sit, sit, sit.

53:57.400 --> 53:59.880
I got you espressos. Yours is decaf.

54:02.000 --> 54:03.411
I don't get to see you two enough.

54:03.480 --> 54:06.290
Just so you know, Pascal,
I have to be at my friend's house by 3:00.

54:06.360 --> 54:08.681
Gretel, call me Dad, please.

54:09.160 --> 54:10.446
Geez, okay.

54:12.360 --> 54:14.681
Look at you young ladies,
you look so much older.

54:15.600 --> 54:17.204
- How's school?
- Fine.

54:21.000 --> 54:22.240
How's your mother?

54:22.360 --> 54:24.080
- Oh, she's doing really...
- She got fired.

54:24.120 --> 54:26.122
- Gretel!
- What?

54:27.520 --> 54:28.567
She what?

54:29.240 --> 54:31.720
She got laid off. It wasn't her fault.

54:34.640 --> 54:36.051
Okay, you know,

54:39.120 --> 54:42.806
what you girls may not understand
about your mother

54:42.880 --> 54:48.603
is she is, and has always been, incapable
of taking responsibility for her own life.

54:48.720 --> 54:50.961
Don't talk about our mom like that, please.

54:51.040 --> 54:52.280
Yeah, Pascal,
don't talk about our mom like that.

54:52.360 --> 54:54.283
Dad. It's Dad.

54:54.360 --> 54:57.045
And, okay, fine,
just stop with the inquisition.

54:57.200 --> 54:59.885
I'm gonna go see if they have iced tea.
I hate coffee.

55:00.080 --> 55:01.366
It's espresso.

55:04.000 --> 55:05.843
You know,
I'm not the bad guy here.

55:06.360 --> 55:08.647
Just because your mother and
I no longer share a marital bed...

55:08.720 --> 55:10.961
Oh, my God. Gross.

55:11.040 --> 55:12.121
You have to understand,

55:12.360 --> 55:14.089
it's difficult to go from raising you
and your sister

55:14.160 --> 55:16.481
to barely having a say
in any of your decisions.

55:16.560 --> 55:18.005
Whose choice was that?

55:18.080 --> 55:19.923
Well, if you must know,
it was your mother's.

55:21.400 --> 55:23.607
And that is not to say I was without fault,

55:24.920 --> 55:28.208
but she became increasingly frightening
to me in some sense.

55:28.280 --> 55:32.126
She does not live life
according to rules I understand.

55:32.840 --> 55:35.320
Pascal, do you really want to help?

55:35.400 --> 55:37.004
Yes, I do. Of course I do.

55:37.400 --> 55:41.610
Morn doesn't have a job anymore.
She's looking for another one.

55:43.600 --> 55:45.967
But we kind of don't have any money.

55:47.080 --> 55:48.764
- Ah.
- She doesn't know I'm asking you.

55:48.840 --> 55:52.242
I get it. You're just trying to help.
But...

55:53.560 --> 55:56.530
You know, Minnie,
neither of us can help her.

55:56.880 --> 55:59.690
That's bullshit.
You could help if you cared about us.

55:59.760 --> 56:03.526
I care about you, Minnie.
I care about your well-being.

56:03.600 --> 56:06.365
Why do you think it's me who's paying
for that rich, hippy school of yours?

56:06.440 --> 56:07.601
'Cause you just want everyone to think

56:07.680 --> 56:09.125
that your step-kid is good at science,
or something.

56:09.200 --> 56:11.202
You don't really care about me.

56:11.280 --> 56:14.124
Okay, this conversation is closed.
You're getting emotional.

56:14.200 --> 56:15.440
Fine.

56:15.760 --> 56:16.841
But...

56:18.240 --> 56:21.164
If your mom wants something from me,
she needs to ask me herself.

56:21.240 --> 56:23.760
- Ask you what, Pascal?
- Dad! For fuck's sake!

56:30.280 --> 56:31.850
What are you doing here?

56:32.440 --> 56:33.521
You forgot this.

56:48.200 --> 56:49.804
Is Charlotte here?

56:50.640 --> 56:51.971
No, sir.

56:54.720 --> 56:59.169
<i>You have something
she wants, and she can be pretty grabby.</i>

57:00.800 --> 57:02.564
<i>Well, I'll be horn-swaggled.</i>

57:02.640 --> 57:06.406
<i>A solid gold talking flute
with a diamond skin condition.</i>

57:07.360 --> 57:09.203
- Have her call me.
- Yes, sir.

57:09.480 --> 57:13.326
<i>We better go see Dr. Blinky.
He's a man of great knowledge.</i>

57:13.400 --> 57:17.849
<i>Also, head of my anti-smog, pollution
and witch committee.</i>

57:27.400 --> 57:30.609
I feel so awkward and ugly
and naïve and lonely.

57:30.680 --> 57:32.284
I know how you feel.

57:32.680 --> 57:36.287
I have no friends.
I don't want to go to school ever again.

57:36.680 --> 57:38.205
Nobody loves me.

57:38.520 --> 57:40.124
Maybe I should kill myself.

57:40.200 --> 57:42.646
No. Alienation is good for your art.

57:42.720 --> 57:46.202
Maybe I should paint a picture.
I should paint a picture.

57:46.680 --> 57:49.843
It doesn't matter what kind of art you do,
you just have to do it.

57:51.400 --> 57:56.406
I wanna discipline myself to draw every day.
That's what I have to do, right?

57:57.520 --> 57:59.648
I get distracted sometimes.

57:59.720 --> 58:03.247
I'm overwhelmed by my all-consuming
thoughts about sex and men.

58:04.120 --> 58:05.963
I always wanna be touched.

58:07.080 --> 58:08.809
I don't know what's wrong with me.

58:08.920 --> 58:09.921
I don't know either.

58:10.440 --> 58:13.887
Maybe you're a nympho.
I'm fucking with your head.

58:13.960 --> 58:15.803
Everybody wants to be touched.

58:16.200 --> 58:19.044
I bet I'll listen to these tapes
in a decade or so.

58:19.120 --> 58:20.724
If I'm still alive.

58:21.320 --> 58:23.971
Reminiscing over my wild teenage-hood.

58:24.600 --> 58:29.242
Maybe I'll even let my husband hear.
But he may get too jealous.

58:33.560 --> 58:36.643
<i>People say I'm a lion at heart</i>

58:36.920 --> 58:40.129
<i>But they don't know what I am</i>

58:42.400 --> 58:45.529
<i>People say that I stand apart</i>

58:45.600 --> 58:48.410
<i>But they just don't understand</i>

58:51.280 --> 58:55.251
<i>Every night when the darkness falls</i>

58:55.640 --> 58:58.883
<i>I'll be there at your beck and call</i>

58:58.960 --> 59:01.725
<i>I'm a fool for you, baby</i>

59:03.320 --> 59:05.721
<i>I'm a fool right now</i>

59:08.880 --> 59:11.963
<i>People say I'm a man of means</i>

59:12.120 --> 59:15.761
<i>But my pants are full of holes</i>

59:17.560 --> 59:20.803
<i>People say I'm a holy child</i>

59:20.920 --> 59:24.720
<i>But I'm rich down to my soul</i>

59:26.480 --> 59:30.451
<i>All I need is you close beside me</i>

59:30.840 --> 59:34.049
<i>All I need is to satisfy you</i>

59:34.120 --> 59:37.124
<i>I'm a fool for you, baby</i>

59:38.600 --> 59:41.251
<i>I'm a fool right now</i>

59:42.960 --> 59:46.169
<i>I'm a fool for you, baby</i>

59:47.240 --> 59:50.323
<i>I'm a fool in love</i>

59:51.640 --> 59:52.880
<i>Hey</i>

59:53.000 --> 59:56.163
<i>Every morning when the sun comes up</i>

59:57.160 --> 01:00:01.449
<i>And all your dreams,
they slip away</i>

01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:06.368
<i>I see your face and I understand
You're the only one</i>

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:15.846
<i>What we did gets me sick.
It was so pornographic.</i>

01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:38.046
<i>The sexual nature of Kimmie Minter
is a viscous cervical mucus</i>

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:40.328
<i>that always welcomes mating.</i>

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:41.680
She didn't bring my waffles yet?

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:44.842
- Not yet.
- I'm starving.

01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:50.002
So, where'd Monroe go this morning?

01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:51.885
EST.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:57.245
It's this personal growth workshop thing
he's doing in Sacramento.

01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:59.410
That's hilarious.

01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:03.203
He's trying to better himself.
I think it's noble.

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:06.321
- You don't understand him.
- Minnie...

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:07.970
You don't. It's not your fault.

01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:11.169
I mean, I know you try,
but he's tough to get to know.

01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:12.685
He doesn't let many people in.

01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:14.649
Look, you don't have to be worried.

01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:17.241
It's just a one-time experience,
it's no big deal.

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:19.846
I know.

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:23.728
It's not like I love him or anything.

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:25.445
I mean, not that you do.

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:36.965
I love Monroe.

01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:43.086
I do.

01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:45.401
Okay.

01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:02.966
Hello?

01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:04.606
<i>Minnie.</i>

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:07.440
<i>- It's me.</i>
- Monroe.

01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:09.607
How's EST?

01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:13.081
I kind of got arrested for drunk driving.

01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:14.889
- What?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:17.568
<i>And I didn't have any shoes on.</i>

01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:20.682
<i>And I didn't have my wallet.</i>

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:23.687
Don't worry, it's fine.

01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:29.091
'Cause, the cop was...
He was really, really nice

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:35.005
and he let me ride around
in his car all night,

01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:37.971
chasing bad guys until I sobered up.

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:44.130
<i>Isn't that pretty wild?</i>

01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:46.525
Yeah.

01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:50.371
I don't know.
I just wanted to tell you about it.

01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:55.885
And, uh, you know,

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.401
I knew that you would be the only one
who'd appreciate it.

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:02.210
<i>Hey, could you just talk?</i>

01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:04.284
He loves me.

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:09.528
- Well, have you!
- Are you crazy?

01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:11.121
She's just a kid.

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:13.726
Yeah, she may just be a kid,
but she's still got tits and ass.

01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:16.087
I think you can see
that as well as I can.

01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:18.360
Pascal needs to have the fucking shit
kicked out of him.

01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:22.005
Why do you think he would say
something like that?

01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:24.330
Because he doesn't want you to be happy.

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:27.802
He can't deal with the fact
that you've moved on, and he hasn't.

01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:29.689
You are so full of shit, Monroe!

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:32.047
I've seen you staring at her tits!

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:36.247
My God, are you... What are you saying?

01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:39.642
I don't even know
if she has tits. No.

01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:41.882
I don't. Maybe she does, maybe she doesn't.

01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:43.689
How would I know? I don't look.

01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:46.491
I was probably looking at your tits,
and you got confused.

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:48.801
- Jesus Christ.
- Honey, come sit.

01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:51.247
Sit down, sit down, sit down. Shh.

01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:52.841
Breathe.

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:57.166
Okay, okay, okay.
Have a little sip of this.

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:03.605
Don't let Mr. PhD manipulate you like this.

01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:08.881
You're an independent woman.
You don't take shit from anyone.

01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:10.841
Right?

01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:12.644
Uh-huh. Yeah.

01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:15.480
Oh, look at you.

01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:19.001
What else could I possibly want?

01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:22.565
Nothing.

01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:29.001
I guess it is kind of crazy.

01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:32.289
- It's just that Pascal said that...
- I don't want to hear his name.

01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:36.127
It's all in here.

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:41.641
Is it?

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:45.006
Yes.

01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:55.045
Oh, hello.

01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:58.528
Yeah, there they are.

01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:03.683
She's beginning to suspect.

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:09.243
You make it so obvious.

01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:14.851
I'm only human,

01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:18.561
whether you realize it or not.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.843
And I have feelings, too, you know?

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:26.522
But I know how to keep things in check,
not let it go too far.

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:29.809
And you, you don't.

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:37.170
I'm afraid you're gonna
end up getting hurt.

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:41.562
I think it's better to end it now.

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:50.124
<i>Everything is so loveless
and mediocre.</i>

01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:55.010
I know how you feel. Trust me.

01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:58.369
I've been in love once myself.

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:34.085
<i>I hate men.</i>

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:40.847
<i>I hate men, but I fuck them hard,
hard, hard and thoughtlessly,</i>

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:42.809
<i>because I hate them so much.</i>

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:47.768
- Minnie, are you okay?
- Leave me alone, fuck face!

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:17.971
<i>I hate myself.</i>

01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:20.125
<i>I fucking hate myself.</i>

01:08:16.439 --> 01:08:17.805
What's wrong?

01:08:20.439 --> 01:08:21.645
Nothing.

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:25.611
Can I do anything?

01:08:41.359 --> 01:08:46.890
Actually, do you still have that acid
you got from your brother?

01:08:57.720 --> 01:09:00.087
I'm going insane, and it's your fault!

01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:04.247
Can we just take a little nap for a second?
I didn't sleep last night.

01:09:04.319 --> 01:09:06.287
It's not just up to
you to say this is over.

01:09:06.359 --> 01:09:08.089
I have a say in this, too.

01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:10.522
I hate seeing you like this.

01:09:11.319 --> 01:09:15.644
We are gonna have a talk.
I want... I want... I want us to talk.

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:19.843
Why don't you just let me sleep
for half an hour first?

01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:22.321
- No.
- I didn't sleep last night at all.

01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:27.245
Half an hour and then
we'll talk about everything.

01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:30.290
- Just a half an hour.
- That's it.

01:09:34.359 --> 01:09:37.091
Just sleep, I swear. Come on.

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:43.843
- This is my life.
- Yeah.

01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:18.247
So, did you fuck anyone this week?

01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:24.684
Why do you care?

01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:30.326
You haven't been calling,
so you must be getting it from somewhere.

01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:35.085
Well...

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:38.962
I did meet this guy at the movies.

01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:44.928
This black guy with a huge dick.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.001
Oh, yeah?

01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:57.004
Well, what happened?

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.162
He fucked me in the back of his car.

01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:06.361
Really?

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:09.560
Just like that, huh?

01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:15.131
Yeah.

01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:20.331
I wanted it.

01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:25.006
So, some stranger comes up to you
who wants to fuck you,

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:26.889
and you say, "Yes."

01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:33.003
You gotta be a bit more careful,
Little Minnie.

01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:38.331
You could end up fucking some weirdo
or a killer.

01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:00.926
Okay.

01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:05.530
If we made love, would it screw you up?

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.445
Honestly?

01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:12.920
I won't get attached. I promise.

01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:57.849
<i>This is incredible.</i>

01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:00.241
<i>I see...</i>

01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:02.728
Everything.

01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:29.042
I knew it.

01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:57.480
No, don't do that!

01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:03.320
Oh, fuck.

01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:14.885
No.

01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:19.891
Get off the bed.
Get off the bed now!

01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:24.687
It's level with the windows.
It's gonna kill you.

01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:26.762
Get off the bed now.

01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:27.840
Minnie.

01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:30.724
- I like the bed.
- They're gonna see you.

01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:32.929
Why won't you listen to me?

01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:34.971
Get off the bed.

01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:38.601
Quietly. Quietly, get off the bed.
Get off the bed, now. Come here.

01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:41.567
Come here, that one. Come!

01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:44.883
Why won't you listen to me?

01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:49.166
Minnie, get off the bed now!

01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:53.245
Be quiet, be quiet.

01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:55.445
Get off the bed.

01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:57.488
Stay low, stay low.

01:14:58.760 --> 01:14:59.886
Good.

01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:04.967
Good. I think we're safe.

01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:07.565
Why is this happening?

01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:11.968
I need you, Minnie.

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:21.120
I need you to take care of me now.

01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:26.441
I love you.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.206
What?

01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:34.325
I love you.

01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:38.610
You don't love me?

01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:41.520
I do.

01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:45.803
You don't love me.

01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:48.406
- I...
- No! No, no, you don't love me.

01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:49.806
I love you.

01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:53.291
I love you.

01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:01.444
I love you so much.

01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:03.811
I love you.

01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:06.560
I love you.

01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:07.687
No.

01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:10.084
No, you don't.

01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:12.770
I love you.

01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:15.525
I love you.

01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:23.250
I love you.

01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:25.243
I love you.

01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:27.448
<i>He was vulnerable and weak.</i>

01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:33.123
<i>It was all I'd ever wanted,
and now I had no desire for it.</i>

01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:40.168
You know, I was thinking,

01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:44.925
if you can keep it together,
we could really date when you turn 18.

01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:48.211
I mean, it's not that far away.

01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:50.282
I might even have my boat by then.

01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:54.409
I've already received my first shipment
of the vitamin power tabs.

01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:58.444
Fucking far out, by the way.

01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:24.645
<i>I refuse to be
some sniveling cry-baby.</i>

01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:27.929
<i>I'm a fucking woman, and this is my life.</i>

01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:17.441
Hi.

01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:20.441
Hey.

01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:30.886
Your hand is hot.

01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:34.649
It means you're alive.

01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:36.769
You've got blood in your veins.

01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:41.725
You scared?

01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:44.685
To try it?

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:46.651
No.

01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:50.002
I'm not afraid of anything.

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:53.289
- No?
- No.

01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:56.170
I'm not afraid of knives or guns,

01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:59.164
or fire or poison,

01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:01.169
rape,

01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:03.603
or being kidnapped and tortured,

01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:07.446
or brainwashed, hypnotized
like that Patty Hearst girl.

01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:17.764
Are you afraid of me?

01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:21.366
A little.

01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:37.489
<i>...like they would die
if I were gone.</i>

01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:41.887
<i>Maybe Monroe could love me like that.</i>

01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:52.201
How long has this been going on?

01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:54.885
What?

01:19:57.320 --> 01:19:58.731
When did this start?

01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:01.926
Mom...

01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:08.726
How long, Minnie?

01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:11.170
How long?

01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:18.762
Mom? What's happening?

01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:22.561
Minnie? Mom?

01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:24.405
Gretel, out!

01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:28.889
Who started it, you?

01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:34.445
I knew it.

01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:38.007
I knew it. I fucking knew it.

01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:42.847
And he made me feel
like I was fucking crazy, and I knew it!

01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:46.367
Mom. Mom, I wanted to tell you.

01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:53.771
I can't fucking look at you.

01:20:56.920 --> 01:20:58.763
Stay here.

01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:19.651
Fuck! No!

01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:23.721
No.

01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:26.450
Mom?

01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:52.370
There she is.

01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:54.604
How you doin', kiddo?

01:21:57.400 --> 01:21:59.926
Minnie, Monroe's got something
he has to tell you.

01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:01.281
Hmm?

01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:04.011
- Sit down.
- Let's just all relax, you know?

01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:07.004
- Take it easy for a minute.
- No, let's just get into it.

01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:08.963
Let's get right to it. Right?

01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:10.926
Isn't that what people do?

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.526
Okay. Uh... Minnie...

01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:16.089
Your mother and I, we've been talking,

01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:19.522
and she, or we, thought that...

01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:24.363
...maybe you and I should get married.

01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:27.681
You're drunk.

01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:30.011
I'm not drunk.

01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:34.287
I mean, we get along pretty well.
Don't you think? I think we do.

01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:36.761
That's not the point,
that you get along with her.

01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:37.841
That's not the point.

01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:40.890
The point is that you fucked my daughter,

01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:43.122
and so you're gonna marry her.
That's the point.

01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:44.201
Mom.

01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:45.881
What?

01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:49.606
It's true, right? He porked you?

01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:54.601
He porked you,
and so now he's gotta marry you!

01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:57.286
- People are staring.
- Who cares? Fuck you.

01:22:57.960 --> 01:22:59.610
What, are you embarrassed?

01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:02.282
You embarrassed
that you porked my daughter?

01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:04.402
Are you crazy? Stop saying "pork."

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:07.003
Do not talk to me like that.

01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:09.250
Not right now.

01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:19.930
I got married when I was around your age,
it's not so bad.

01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:22.445
I said I would marry her.

01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:25.086
And I will.

01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:27.486
I'm a man of my word.

01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:30.245
- All right, then.
- Mmm.

01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:34.443
Great. You can marry her, and then
you can fuck her any time you want.

01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:36.090
Mmm. Oh, yeah.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.446
- Minnie.
- Just let her go.

01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:50.962
<i>What I want</i>

01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:52.690
Hey, truck driver.

01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:54.125
<i>I want now</i>

01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:58.005
<i>And it's a whole lot more</i>

01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:00.407
<i>Than anyhow</i>

01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:04.327
<i>I want to fly</i>

01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:07.726
<i>Fly a fountain</i>

01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:13.971
<i>I want to jump, jump, jump
Jump a mountain</i>

01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:19.443
<i>I understand all</i>

01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:22.530
<i>Destructive urges</i>

01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:25.804
<i>But it seems so perfect</i>

01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:28.285
<i>I see</i>

01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:33.487
<i>I see no evil</i>

01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:44.324
<i>I'm runnin' wild with the one I love</i>

01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:47.684
<i>I'm going crazy with the one I love</i>

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:51.163
<i>How could you make it with the one I love</i>

01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:54.484
<i>Discard the feelings of the one you love</i>

01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:58.927
<i>It's not a lit-up streetlight hazy
darkness like most nights.</i>

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:02.561
<i>It is a black crisp night
and my eyes are like headlights.</i>

01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:09.131
<i>I've become nothing, finally.</i>

01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:13.447
<i>No home, no school, no money.</i>

01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:25.967
<i>I haven't been home in days.
I don't know how it happened, really.</i>

01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:36.609
Who's Mike again?

01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:38.485
My friend.

01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:41.167
You met him last night. He's cool.

01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:43.521
He has so many stairs.

01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:46.488
I wanna go back to bed.

01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:47.607
We will.

01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:53.247
We just gotta make this one stop first, okay?
Like we talked about?

01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:56.762
Mike's been asking about you.

01:25:57.280 --> 01:25:59.362
So, I told him I'd come by.

01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:01.768
He's got really good 'ludes.

01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:03.001
Right.

01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:07.642
You like that, don't you?
Don't I know how to take care of my girl?

01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:10.088
I'm hungry, though.

01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:13.401
Everybody thinks you're so sexy.

01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:17.569
Those eyes and that ass.

01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:20.681
It's a good thing I'm not insecure,

01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:24.409
otherwise I might be getting
all possessive and shit.

01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:27.883
Possessive of me?

01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:31.007
With guys like Mike lusting after you.

01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:33.450
But it's not a big deal.

01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:37.122
I'm not uptight,
and you're not uptight, right?

01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:42.088
What's not a big deal?

01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:48.286
It'll be very quick.
He only takes a few minutes.

01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:54.442
I need you to do this for me, okay?

01:26:55.480 --> 01:26:57.482
You gonna do this for me, baby?

01:26:57.560 --> 01:26:58.766
Yeah.

01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:01.565
Good.

01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:05.085
Good. You're doing good.

01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:19.561
Baby, you hungry?
We're making grilled cheese.

01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:43.482
Yeah, she's real young. You like that?

01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:19.484
Minnie?

01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:34.170
God damn it, Minnie.

01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:36.080
Sorry.

01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:45.808
Are you okay?

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:48.411
Are you okay?

01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:50.847
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God, we were so worried about you.

01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:53.241
- I looked everywhere for you.
- You did?

01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:54.685
Of course.

01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:58.729
I've been looking all night.
I've looked every single night since you left.

01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:00.450
I was so afraid...

01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:05.967
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay. Shh.

01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:07.486
I'm sorry.

01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:12.761
- I wanted to tell you about Monroe.
- No.

01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:14.330
- I really did. I just...
- Stop.

01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:15.401
- ...didn't know how to tell you.
- No, please.

01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:17.528
- And I knew that you would be...
- Don't.

01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:20.165
Okay?

01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:25.808
I can't talk about that.

01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:29.844
Ever. Okay?

01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:41.524
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:04.284
<i>"Dear Minnie,
thank you for your letter.</i>

01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:06.442
<i>"It is refreshing to receive
a letter from a girl,</i>

01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:09.205
<i>"because most letters I get
are from greasy fan boys</i>

01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:11.044
<i>"who think that I'm cute.</i>

01:32:11.120 --> 01:32:14.681
<i>"Keep drawing those comics.
Keep drawing anything you can.</i>

01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:16.524
<i>"Just keep drawing.</i>

01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:19.251
<i>"Oh, and I use indian ink as well.</i>

01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:21.323
<i>"Love, Aline Kominsky."</i>

01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:25.325
<i>Wrap your troubles in dreams</i>

01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:29.845
<i>Send them all away</i>

01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:34.930
<i>Put them in a bottle and</i>

01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:37.125
<i>Across the seas</i>

01:32:37.320 --> 01:32:40.005
<i>Did you ever go back to
your preschool once you had gotten big,</i>

01:32:40.080 --> 01:32:41.411
<i>and everything looked miniature,</i>

01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:44.370
<i>like the chairs and the monkey bars,</i>

01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:47.200
<i>just much smaller than you remembered?</i>

01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:52.242
<i>I know nothing's changed,</i>

01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:55.005
<i>but everything looks
totally different to me now.</i>

01:32:55.680 --> 01:32:59.002
<i>Just steal yourself a holiday</i>

01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:03.130
<i>Crouching by the door</i>

01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:05.049
It's 50 cents.

01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:06.645
Oh, thanks.

01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:17.963
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:19.760
Hey.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:23.331
You're alone, or...

01:33:23.400 --> 01:33:27.485
No, Gretel's with me.
She went to find a bathroom.

01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:28.561
Ah.

01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:32.201
She had to pee.

01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:35.000
Yeah.

01:33:39.240 --> 01:33:41.208
So, you wanna buy a drawing?

01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:43.531
Or a 'zine?

01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:48.048
I have no money, you know?

01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:50.730
Jogging shorts and all.

01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:52.962
Here, take this one.

01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:56.249
You can give the 50 cents to my mom
the next time you see her.

01:33:57.520 --> 01:33:58.681
Oh.

01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:03.045
Thank you.

01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:10.888
Goodbye, Monroe.

01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:15.290
Goodbye, Minnie.

01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:19.843
<i>I'm better than you,
you son of a bitch.</i>

01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:38.724
<i>We can run to the mountains</i>

01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:43.648
<i>We can sail the Emerald Sea</i>

01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:45.000
<i>Drop a coin...</i>

01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:48.402
<i>I always thought
I wanted to be exactly like my mom.</i>

01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:51.002
<i>I got a girl
She's sick as can be</i>

01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:52.610
<i>All the other boys wanna be like me</i>

01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:55.366
<i>But she thinks she needs a man
to be happy.</i>

01:34:56.760 --> 01:34:58.091
<i>I don't.</i>

01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:00.367
<i>Danny</i>

01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:05.642
If anyone asks, we're sisters.

01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:09.241
<i>Well I chased that girl
round the Frisco Bay</i>

01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:11.721
<i>Don't believe everything your mama say</i>

01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:12.801
<i>And, oh</i>

01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:16.327
<i>So, maybe nobody loves me.</i>

01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:19.441
<i>Maybe nobody will ever love me.</i>

01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:24.522
<i>But maybe it's not about
being loved by somebody else.</i>

01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:29.648
<i>We can run to the mountains</i>

01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:33.645
<i>We can sail the Emerald Sea</i>

01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:39.007
<i>Drop a coin in every fountain</i>

01:35:39.080 --> 01:35:42.687
<i>'Cause it's true when I wake up
and I see you next to me</i>

01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:48.089
<i>'Cause it's true when I wake up
and I see you next to me</i>

01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:53.404
<i>This is for all the girls
when they have grown.</i>

01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:56.609
<i>Signing off, trusty diary.</i>

01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:01.162
<i>Love, Minnie Goetze.</i>

01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:24.169
<i>What did you dream about last night?</i>

01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:28.444
<i>How did you feel when you woke up today?</i>

01:38:28.640 --> 01:38:33.168
<i>I had a dream about you last night</i>

01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:37.524
<i>Why do they always end the same way?</i>

01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:42.242
<i>I wanna know what happened last night</i>

01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:46.245
<i>After you closed your eyes</i>

01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:50.928
<i>Was it scary or weird?
Or do you not remember</i>

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:55.801
<i>Did you want it to end or reprise?</i>

01:38:55.920 --> 01:39:01.768
<i>You don't have to dream</i>

01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:04.362
<i>About me</i>

01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:10.484
<i>I can't help but dream</i>

01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:13.049
<i>About you</i>

01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:19.769
<i>Woo, and there is nothing you can do</i>

01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:28.570
<i>Woo, and there is nothing you can do</i>

01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:36.171
<i>I had a dream where I was a princess</i>

01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:40.490
<i>And I had to rule but I didn't know how</i>

01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:45.361
<i>And before I could learn,
I turned into someone</i>

01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:49.570
<i>I knew long ago but I don't know now</i>

01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:54.684
<i>Then there's the one
where I'm watching my own life</i>

01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:58.805
<i>Sung like an opera without any sound</i>

01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:03.204
<i>When they get to the part
with the falling in love</i>

01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:07.649
<i>The conductor runs off
and the curtain comes down</i>

01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:13.725
<i>You don't have to dream</i>

01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:16.607
<i>About me</i>

01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:22.969
<i>But I can't help but dream</i>

01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:26.125
<i>About you</i>

01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:32.010
<i>Woo, and there is nothing you can do</i>

01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:40.924
<i>Woo, and there is nothing you can do</i>

01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:48.531
<i>I wake up and remember</i>

01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:52.566
<i>Exactly how you feel</i>

01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:57.328
<i>So pinch me, baby</i>

01:40:57.480 --> 01:41:01.485
<i>'Cause it's hard to know what's real</i>

01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:06.924
<i>You put the postcard I sent</i>

01:41:07.320 --> 01:41:11.120
<i>Under your pillow just to see</i>

01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:15.646
<i>I don't care if it worked or what</i>

01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:20.448
<i>It's enough that you're trying
to dream about me</i>
