01:03.600 --> 01:08.288
Welcome. You're just in time for
our story. An epic detective adventure.

01:08.640 --> 01:10.608
Sherlock Holmes, the greatest...

01:11.000 --> 01:13.960
- Let's do "Gnomeo and Juliet" instead!
- We've already done that.

01:14.040 --> 01:16.480
- I know! "Game of Gnomes"!
- Or "The Gnome Ranger."

01:16.560 --> 01:18.449
No, we're doing this.

01:18.920 --> 01:22.120
Sherlock Holmes,
the greatest detective of all time.

01:22.200 --> 01:23.960
And ours will be the best ever.

01:24.040 --> 01:26.080
Because our Sherlock is a...

01:26.160 --> 01:28.080
- Let's do "The Twilight Gnome."
- No!

01:28.160 --> 01:29.960
Or "Spider-Man: Gnomecoming."

01:30.040 --> 01:31.360
Or "Indiana Gnomes."

01:31.440 --> 01:35.161
No! Because our Sherlock is a garden gnome!

01:35.800 --> 01:38.200
He's a garden gnome! Okay?

01:38.280 --> 01:40.408
Why didn't you just say that?

01:41.200 --> 01:45.603
Prepare for a tale of suspense,
intrigue, and mystery.

01:46.280 --> 01:47.360
Mystery.

01:47.440 --> 01:50.285
Prepare for "Sherlock Gnomes."

01:55.280 --> 01:58.760
The final clue.
The kidnapped gnomes are in the museum.

01:58.840 --> 02:00.524
And seconds away from being smashed!

02:00.640 --> 02:02.882
We shall see about that.

02:07.680 --> 02:09.560
Show yourself, Moriarty!

02:09.639 --> 02:11.640
Help! I'm stuck!

02:11.720 --> 02:14.371
Oh, Sherlock.
How can I resist a request like that?

02:14.680 --> 02:18.720
Ta-da! Here I am!
Your favorite evil pie mascot.

02:18.800 --> 02:21.200
Though I said "evil," I do cry at sad films.

02:21.280 --> 02:22.964
I'm very complex. Don't try and get me.

02:23.400 --> 02:24.680
Shirley. Could I call you that?

02:24.760 --> 02:28.242
You are just in time
to see these gnomes go extinct.

02:30.640 --> 02:32.722
This stops now, Moriarty.

02:32.840 --> 02:36.120
Be honest, Sherlock.
You enjoy our little game as much as I do.

02:36.200 --> 02:40.000
This is no game. I am the sworn protector
of London's garden gnomes.

02:40.080 --> 02:42.720
If you are the sworn protector
of the city's gnomes,

02:42.800 --> 02:44.680
then I am their sworn destroyer!

02:44.760 --> 02:47.960
And we will keep playing
this little game, Sherlock,

02:48.040 --> 02:50.760
until I crush every last gnome in London.

02:50.840 --> 02:53.560
I'll stop you until the day I die.

02:53.640 --> 02:55.802
Oh, lightbulb moment. What is it?

02:56.440 --> 02:58.040
Yeah, today's that day.

02:58.120 --> 03:00.646
Come, Sherlock. Come dance with me.

03:21.480 --> 03:22.527
Ow!

03:22.920 --> 03:24.047
No!

03:26.600 --> 03:28.284
Fudge buckets.

03:31.440 --> 03:32.328
Sherlock!

03:37.240 --> 03:39.163
Hooray, Sherlock! Yay!

03:42.080 --> 03:46.563
No thanks needed. It is my sworn duty
to protect you. No hugs.

03:47.160 --> 03:49.600
- Oh, Watson.
- Yes, Sherlock?

03:49.680 --> 03:51.091
Yours, I believe.

03:58.480 --> 03:59.880
It's over, Watson.

03:59.960 --> 04:05.285
With Moriarty gone, London is once again
safe for all garden gnomes.

04:49.600 --> 04:52.080
Our new home in London.

04:52.160 --> 04:53.960
Doesn't it look lovely?

04:54.040 --> 04:55.804
It's a long way from Stratford-upon-Avon.

04:56.080 --> 04:58.160
But a lot closer to the grandkids.

04:58.240 --> 05:01.483
We'll feel better
once we get our gnomes in the garden.

05:06.680 --> 05:10.002
London. A brand-new adventure for us...

05:10.240 --> 05:12.320
and our star-crossed lovers,

05:12.400 --> 05:14.767
Gnomeo and Juliet.

05:16.600 --> 05:20.960
Let's go out and buy an expensive coffee.
That's what people do around here.

05:21.040 --> 05:23.040
I've been practicing my order.

05:23.120 --> 05:26.363
A skinny triple shot soy latte, extra dry.

05:38.120 --> 05:39.406
What a dump!

05:41.960 --> 05:43.400
Where's the new garden?

05:43.480 --> 05:45.960
This is the new garden, Fawn.

05:46.040 --> 05:48.247
No, no, I'm going back in the box.

05:48.440 --> 05:49.480
<i>This garden is:</i>

05:49.560 --> 05:50.925
<i>This garden is...</i>

05:51.200 --> 05:52.930
Girls! Language.

05:53.280 --> 05:55.440
I guess it's a... fixer-upper?

05:55.520 --> 05:59.969
Well, I think that it's the most
beautiful garden in the world...

06:00.640 --> 06:02.320
because you're standing in it.

06:02.400 --> 06:05.000
- That was super cheesy.
- Aw, seriously?

06:05.080 --> 06:07.970
I practiced that line in the car
for about ten minutes.

06:08.480 --> 06:10.130
It was, like, awful.

06:11.760 --> 06:14.081
I bet there's a pretty good view up there.

06:15.160 --> 06:16.685
I'll let you know when I get there first.

06:17.680 --> 06:18.886
Right, come here.

06:29.280 --> 06:30.407
You win.

06:31.960 --> 06:33.530
Come here!

06:56.720 --> 06:58.882
Think of all the adventures we're gonna have.

06:59.600 --> 07:02.809
Juliet, come down this instant,
before you fall.

07:03.520 --> 07:07.080
When is he gonna realize
you're the toughest gnome in the garden?

07:07.160 --> 07:09.322
Now that was a good line.

07:11.440 --> 07:14.444
She loves me. She loves me not.
She loves me...

07:14.920 --> 07:16.360
Hi, Nanette.

07:16.440 --> 07:19.046
I think someone's got a crush on someone.

07:19.600 --> 07:20.800
Maybe.

07:20.880 --> 07:23.770
Maybe they have a crush on you back.

07:23.880 --> 07:25.200
Do you really think so?

07:25.280 --> 07:27.487
I don't know. I don't know who it is, do I?

07:27.800 --> 07:29.928
- Gather 'round, everyone.
- Come on, everybody!

07:31.960 --> 07:34.770
Choppity-chop! We have an announcement.

07:36.720 --> 07:40.200
Lord Redbrick and I are officially retiring.

07:40.280 --> 07:44.440
We both think a new garden
is the perfect opportunity

07:44.520 --> 07:46.841
to name new leaders.

07:47.320 --> 07:50.051
Gnomeo and Juliet.

07:50.560 --> 07:51.607
Us?

07:53.240 --> 07:56.323
Hooray for nepotism. Unbelievable.

07:56.600 --> 08:01.083
Gnomeo and Juliet will lead us
in preparing the garden for winter.

08:01.320 --> 08:04.802
As soon as the garden blooms in the spring...

08:05.120 --> 08:08.363
we'll have a Seedling Ceremony to celebrate.

08:08.840 --> 08:10.524
Come along, dear.

08:11.720 --> 08:14.000
Look at this place. Isn't it perfect?

08:14.080 --> 08:15.240
It's awful.

08:15.320 --> 08:18.160
Unbelievably awful. But it is ours.

08:18.240 --> 08:23.042
Yeah, it's ours. And I'm gonna show
this garden who's boss.

08:32.480 --> 08:35.051
Watson! Look what you've done to the globe.

08:35.440 --> 08:37.520
Me? You're the one who kicked it.

08:37.600 --> 08:41.320
Because you ducked. The very reason you're
wearing padding is so I can kick you.

08:41.400 --> 08:43.320
I am not your punching bag!

08:43.400 --> 08:45.289
Don't be absurd. Of course you are.

08:45.840 --> 08:47.720
How I miss having a proper enemy.

08:47.800 --> 08:50.565
Well, I'm sorry I'm not Moriarty.

08:51.160 --> 08:54.240
Sherlock! Watson! Just look at this mess!

08:54.320 --> 08:56.280
How many times have I told you?

08:56.360 --> 08:59.760
If you want to practice fighting,
do it outside!

08:59.840 --> 09:01.560
We're sorry, Mrs. Udderson.

09:01.640 --> 09:03.920
Sherlock Gnomes! Sherlock Gnomes!

09:04.000 --> 09:05.331
And Dr...

09:05.840 --> 09:07.400
Finally, a new case.

09:07.480 --> 09:09.080
- What seems to be the trouble?
- It's my friends.

09:09.160 --> 09:13.600
All my friends. The whole garden.
They've disappeared. They're all gone!

09:13.680 --> 09:15.000
A whole garden?

09:15.080 --> 09:18.163
Watson, gnomes are in danger.
To the scene of the crime.

09:18.600 --> 09:22.491
<i>Breaking news! While London prepares</i>
<i>for its largest fireworks display ever...</i>

09:22.800 --> 09:25.800
<i>something barely newsworthy</i>
<i>is happening in London's gardens.</i>

09:25.880 --> 09:28.042
<i>Someone is stealing innocent gnomes.</i>

09:28.360 --> 09:31.920
<i>Like Barry. Barry was just sitting there,</i>
<i>doing nothing. Now he's gone.</i>

09:32.000 --> 09:34.040
<i>And Barry is just the tip of the iceberg.</i>

09:34.120 --> 09:36.960
<i>Susan, Tim, Brad, gone.</i>

09:37.040 --> 09:39.760
<i>This weird gnome</i>
<i>with his sparkly piano, gone!</i>

09:39.840 --> 09:43.920
<i>These gnomes on a pig.</i>
<i>I hope that's not ham on that pizza.</i>

09:44.000 --> 09:46.880
<i>All gone! The list goes on.</i>

09:46.960 --> 09:48.400
<i>When contacted, the police said:</i>

09:48.480 --> 09:51.404
<i>We have no time for this.</i>
<i>Please don't contact us again.</i>

09:52.400 --> 09:53.925
<i>They're clearly swamped.</i>

09:54.400 --> 09:57.210
<i>Some say it's a job for Sherlock Gnomes.</i>

09:57.680 --> 10:00.251
<i>Others say it's a slow news day.</i>

10:04.800 --> 10:06.848
All right, Barbara, time for bed.

10:11.320 --> 10:13.640
Humans are tiresomely naive.

10:13.720 --> 10:17.202
It is an ornamental crime on a scale
we have never seen before.

10:17.640 --> 10:20.371
This garden alone lost ten gnomes today.

10:22.800 --> 10:26.691
Grass, perfectly even. Soil, undisturbed.

10:27.120 --> 10:29.168
Ant colony, thriving.

10:29.720 --> 10:32.610
- Do you see it, Watson?
- Yes, there are no footprints.

10:38.800 --> 10:42.009
Someone kidnapped all the gnomes
from this backyard...

10:42.400 --> 10:45.688
without leaving a single footprint.

10:52.240 --> 10:53.600
A gnome can dream.

10:53.680 --> 10:54.920
Benny.

10:56.680 --> 11:01.240
So, have you talked to the lucky lady yet?
Told your mystery crush you adore her?

11:01.320 --> 11:03.800
Funny you should say that. No.

11:04.240 --> 11:06.083
Why not? Is she that scary? Is she?

11:06.400 --> 11:07.891
She can be.

11:09.680 --> 11:11.171
<i>La vida buena.</i>

11:12.000 --> 11:15.083
Don't work too hard, Mankini. You've only
been lying there for four days.

11:15.480 --> 11:17.084
Sun's out, buns out!

11:18.920 --> 11:20.331
I'm okay.

11:22.920 --> 11:25.160
We said we'd plant these
next to the shed, remember?

11:25.240 --> 11:27.322
Yeah, but they look better there.

11:28.160 --> 11:30.520
Oh, all right. I suppose.

11:30.600 --> 11:32.045
Let me help you with that.

11:35.160 --> 11:36.730
- I feel sick.
- Me, too.

11:36.840 --> 11:40.400
This garden is still missing something.
Something special.

11:40.480 --> 11:43.040
I was just thinking that.
You know what would be great?

11:43.120 --> 11:45.407
Something that will tie
the whole garden together.

11:46.720 --> 11:48.960
What about... a new centerpiece?

11:49.040 --> 11:50.080
I'm gonna throw up.

11:50.160 --> 11:52.845
I've got it. We need a new centerpiece.

11:53.440 --> 11:54.965
That's exactly what I just said.

11:55.200 --> 11:57.960
Never mind, great minds think alike.
Am I right?

11:58.040 --> 12:00.441
There's so much to do.
I better get started on it.

12:01.800 --> 12:02.961
Awkward.

12:04.600 --> 12:07.240
Don't you worry. I know her.

12:07.320 --> 12:09.926
And she was hanging on to your every word.

12:10.360 --> 12:11.851
I think he bought it.

12:11.960 --> 12:13.280
Ever since we took over the garden,

12:13.360 --> 12:16.170
it's like she's not listening to me anymore.

12:18.440 --> 12:22.320
Oh, sorry, I wasn't listening.
But I have got an idea.

12:22.400 --> 12:25.760
You should do a grand romantic gesture.

12:25.840 --> 12:27.880
Something reckless and life-threatening.

12:27.960 --> 12:29.760
<i>This is going to be a terrible idea</i>

12:29.840 --> 12:30.841
<i>Yes</i>

12:31.320 --> 12:32.600
I've got it!

12:32.680 --> 12:37.040
Go to the zoo and steal a lion!
Then fight the lion in front of Juliet.

12:37.120 --> 12:38.840
I am not fighting a lion.

12:38.920 --> 12:43.244
It doesn't have to be a lion.
It could be a tiger, or an angry penguin.

12:43.640 --> 12:45.560
It's either that or flowers.

12:45.640 --> 12:49.560
That's it! I'll get her our special flower
for the centerpiece.

12:49.640 --> 12:51.449
Nanette, you're a genius.

12:52.720 --> 12:54.802
Benny, can you give me a hand with something?

12:55.120 --> 12:56.690
Step into my office.

13:04.080 --> 13:08.643
The previous owners left a bunch
of amazing electronics in here.

13:11.200 --> 13:14.280
<i>Benny and Nanette</i>
<i>Benny and Nanette</i>

13:14.360 --> 13:16.520
It was on the computer when I found it.

13:16.600 --> 13:18.682
Yeah, mate. Yeah, sure it was.

13:19.480 --> 13:21.562
Right. Image search.

13:22.040 --> 13:24.486
All right, type in "Cupid's Arrow Orchid".

13:25.720 --> 13:27.360
You just have to hit it. Just click it.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.880
Just click the thing! You don't have
to type the whole sent... All right.

13:29.960 --> 13:32.440
Tell me when you see it.

13:32.520 --> 13:33.840
That's the one!

13:33.920 --> 13:36.685
First time we met
we was trying to get one of those.

13:37.400 --> 13:39.767
So, we just need to find a flower shop
that sells them.

13:43.160 --> 13:44.760
Zero-point-eight miles.

13:44.840 --> 13:48.200
And looks like there's a massive blue line
on the ground you can follow.

13:48.280 --> 13:49.400
Isn't that handy?

13:49.480 --> 13:50.720
Let's do this.

13:57.320 --> 14:00.210
I'll have eyes and ears on you at all times.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.730
All right, mate? Let's go liberate a flower!

14:20.280 --> 14:22.200
<i>Tiny Dancer, come in, Tiny Dancer.</i>

14:22.280 --> 14:24.920
<i>This is Benny 101 dash brackets the Benlord</i>

14:25.000 --> 14:28.891
<i>closed brackets exclamation mark</i>
<i>smiley-face emoji dollar sign dollar sign.</i>

14:29.680 --> 14:32.365
- You have got to pick another code name.
- There's no time.

14:45.600 --> 14:46.560
Benny, can you...

14:46.640 --> 14:50.480
<i>Benny 101 dash brackets the Benlord</i>
<i>closed brackets exclamation mark</i>

14:50.560 --> 14:53.530
<i>smiley-face emoji dollar sign dollar sign.</i>
<i>Yes?</i>

14:54.920 --> 14:57.685
Can you pull up the shop's blueprints
and show me the best entry points?

14:57.880 --> 14:59.160
Yes, I can.

14:59.240 --> 15:00.600
No, I can't.

15:00.680 --> 15:05.686
You ca... I see a ventilation shaft.
Will that get me inside?

15:08.960 --> 15:12.169
I have no idea. It might. Over.

15:14.960 --> 15:16.000
All right, I'm in.

15:16.080 --> 15:17.969
<i>Nice work, Tiny Dancer.</i>

15:24.040 --> 15:26.520
<i>That must be the burglar alarm.</i>
<i>What's your plan, Tiny D?</i>

15:26.600 --> 15:30.720
Just the usual. Totally wing it, risk life
and limb, escape by the skin of my teeth.

15:30.800 --> 15:32.723
I call it "pulling a Gnomeo."

15:36.320 --> 15:38.368
And... don't call me Tiny D.

15:52.040 --> 15:54.880
Gnomeo? Hey, Benny, have you seen Gnomeo?

15:54.960 --> 15:57.042
No! Well, maybe.

15:57.640 --> 16:00.520
Is that Gnomeo? He left the garden?

16:00.600 --> 16:02.330
<i>- Where is he? What is he doing?</i>
- Oh, no.

16:06.200 --> 16:08.203
Oh, fertilizer.

16:17.200 --> 16:19.567
Next time, remember to have an escape plan.

16:20.840 --> 16:22.365
If there is a next time.

16:36.520 --> 16:37.726
Hurry.

16:41.440 --> 16:44.603
Eight gardens of gnomes vanish into thin air.

16:45.200 --> 16:49.125
No clues. Not so much as a single footprint.

16:49.560 --> 16:52.166
There is only one ornament
evil enough and brilliant enough

16:52.280 --> 16:55.045
to pull off such a diabolical scheme.

16:55.680 --> 16:56.560
Moriarty!

16:56.640 --> 17:00.691
Moriarty? But that's impossible.
Moriarty was smashed. We saw it.

17:01.240 --> 17:04.561
We can't have seen the complete picture.
He's alive.

17:05.119 --> 17:06.804
How could he possibly have survived?

17:06.920 --> 17:10.000
Anyway, Moriarty always left us a clue,
his calling card.

17:10.079 --> 17:13.846
Yes. What am I missing?

17:14.960 --> 17:16.246
Watson, give me your map.

17:20.240 --> 17:23.243
The gnomes that just moved in...
where do they live?

17:23.560 --> 17:25.085
I believe right here.

17:26.160 --> 17:29.050
Do you see, Watson?
Moriarty has left his calling card...

17:30.720 --> 17:35.089
"M!" Hurry, Watson!
Those gnomes are in terrible danger.

17:39.480 --> 17:41.448
Juliet! Wait! Stop! I...

17:43.080 --> 17:44.240
I can explain.

17:44.320 --> 17:46.120
What on earth were you thinking?

17:46.200 --> 17:47.691
I was getting this!

17:48.040 --> 17:49.200
Remember this?

17:49.280 --> 17:51.760
You risked getting smashed for some flower?

17:51.880 --> 17:55.200
Not some flower, our flower.
I did this for you.

17:55.280 --> 17:57.440
You did this for me? For me?

17:57.520 --> 18:00.524
I've got responsibilities.
I don't have time for this!

18:00.640 --> 18:02.080
No, you just don't have time for us.

18:02.160 --> 18:05.800
There will be plenty of time for us
after I get the garden ready.

18:05.880 --> 18:08.760
Unbelievable! What do you care more
about, the garden or me?

18:08.840 --> 18:11.000
- You're being ridiculous!
- That is not an answer.

18:11.080 --> 18:14.084
The garden can't wait and you can!

18:18.480 --> 18:21.131
<i>Gnomeo, help!</i>
<i>There's something here! It's a...</i>

18:22.120 --> 18:23.565
Benny! What's going on?

18:36.320 --> 18:38.000
- Dad!
- Mom!

18:38.080 --> 18:39.525
- Nanette!
- Benny!

18:40.000 --> 18:41.331
Ju, they're all gone.

18:42.160 --> 18:43.605
We're too late.

18:44.280 --> 18:45.441
Please step back.

18:45.560 --> 18:47.085
This is an active crime scene.

18:47.840 --> 18:49.968
Who are you
and what are you doing in our garden?

18:50.320 --> 18:53.480
Your garden? Where were the two of you
when this happened?

18:53.560 --> 18:55.800
Oh, they were having a lovers' quarrel.

18:55.880 --> 18:59.202
See how she's facing away from him?
She's angry with him.

18:59.520 --> 19:02.240
The flower in his hand was intended
as a romantic gesture,

19:02.320 --> 19:04.840
a desperate act that predictably backfired.

19:04.920 --> 19:05.800
Oi!

19:05.880 --> 19:08.008
Watson, search the west quadrant.

19:08.360 --> 19:12.047
If that fiend is behind this,
he will have left his calling card.

19:12.400 --> 19:13.401
What's this?

19:15.080 --> 19:18.050
- Let me see that.
- Tell me what it is.

19:18.280 --> 19:21.520
It's a clue. It will lead us
to our next destination.

19:21.600 --> 19:25.491
If you ever want to see your friends
and family again, you'll hand it over.

19:31.240 --> 19:32.685
The nine.

19:33.400 --> 19:35.209
There is a slight crack in its leg.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.891
Where have I seen
this particular nine before?

19:40.440 --> 19:43.011
<i>Nine, nine, nine, nine...</i>

20:01.400 --> 20:03.607
Nine! I've got it!

20:03.720 --> 20:05.165
To Chinatown, Watson.

20:06.320 --> 20:08.288
The game is afoot.

20:09.240 --> 20:11.004
Mate, you're going nowhere...

20:13.080 --> 20:14.920
Stay here! We're on the case.

20:15.000 --> 20:18.163
- What a complete and total...
- Get up. We're going after them.

20:22.040 --> 20:23.041
Wait!

20:41.400 --> 20:42.288
Wait!

20:44.160 --> 20:45.924
All ahead full, Watson.

20:48.320 --> 20:49.890
No, wait for us!

20:52.680 --> 20:53.841
Hold on!

20:54.040 --> 20:55.929
Forget them! We can handle this ourselves.

20:56.560 --> 20:58.449
Or do the exact opposite. Your call.

20:58.680 --> 21:00.569
Keep those tablets coming, Watson.

21:07.400 --> 21:09.482
The water level. It's dropping.

21:10.280 --> 21:11.611
Cut the engines!

21:14.800 --> 21:16.760
Now tell us what happened to our family.

21:16.840 --> 21:19.120
We don't have time for this.
Will you please step aside?

21:19.200 --> 21:21.009
Not until you tell us what's going on.

21:22.680 --> 21:24.444
- Too late.
- What's too late?

21:24.800 --> 21:26.120
Oh, here they come.

21:26.200 --> 21:30.330
And now we have a rat problem,
thanks to these meddlesome amateurs.

21:31.960 --> 21:35.800
If you don't want to get trampled,
I suggest you help Watson pull.

21:35.880 --> 21:37.769
Come on! Give me a hand.

21:44.480 --> 21:45.680
Oh, phew.

21:45.760 --> 21:47.840
"Phew"? Young gnome,

21:47.920 --> 21:51.003
what exactly do you think
those rats were running from?

21:51.320 --> 21:52.162
Oh, no.

22:00.960 --> 22:03.088
There! That's our way out!

22:04.080 --> 22:06.162
Sherlock! Hold on!

22:31.360 --> 22:32.320
Are you okay?

22:32.400 --> 22:35.720
You were saying something about
"meddlesome amateurs"?

22:35.800 --> 22:38.120
I stand by that assessment.

22:38.200 --> 22:42.091
But if you insist on meddling, perhaps
you could supplement Watson's efforts.

22:42.880 --> 22:44.280
How thoughtful.

22:44.360 --> 22:46.800
- What did you say your names were?
- We didn't.

22:46.880 --> 22:48.240
- I'm Gnomeo.
- Juliet.

22:48.320 --> 22:51.360
I'm Sherlock Gnomes,
the world's first consulting detective

22:51.440 --> 22:53.800
and sworn protector
of London's garden gnomes.

22:53.880 --> 22:55.920
- And I am...
- No time for that now, Watson.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.207
To the surface! We've not a moment to lose.

23:00.120 --> 23:03.960
Look, now we're on the team,
how about you tell us what's going on?

23:04.040 --> 23:05.201
Starting with this.

23:05.840 --> 23:09.367
The "M" stands for
Sherlock's archenemy, Moriarty.

23:09.920 --> 23:13.129
<i>Moriarty's pies</i>
<i>The taste that makes you smile</i>

23:13.520 --> 23:16.603
<i>Filled with goobarb syrup</i>
<i>Makes you eat it all the while</i>

23:17.040 --> 23:20.362
<i>Some ornaments are just manufactured evil.</i>

23:21.200 --> 23:24.488
<i>And Moriarty was the most evil of the lot.</i>

23:27.600 --> 23:31.082
<i>For years, Moriarty terrorized</i>
<i>the ornamental world...</i>

23:33.520 --> 23:36.808
<i>until he met his match in Sherlock Gnomes.</i>

23:37.320 --> 23:39.288
<i>Suddenly he had a worthy opponent.</i>

23:39.680 --> 23:41.762
<i>And beating Sherlock became his obsession.</i>

23:42.160 --> 23:44.686
<i>So Moriarty began to play his terrible game.</i>

23:45.800 --> 23:47.484
<i>He would kidnap gnomes...</i>

23:48.800 --> 23:51.565
<i>leave a trail of clues</i>
<i>as to their location...</i>

23:53.040 --> 23:57.160
<i>and challenge us to find them</i>
<i>within 24 hours or he'd smash them.</i>

23:57.240 --> 24:00.680
- He's gonna smash our friends and family?
- So, how do we stop him?

24:00.760 --> 24:02.683
We play his game. For now.

24:03.160 --> 24:05.606
We follow his trail of clues
and find the gnomes.

24:16.840 --> 24:19.207
The nine with a crack in its leg.

24:21.240 --> 24:25.325
Just as I remembered. Curly Fu's Emporium.

24:26.080 --> 24:27.445
Let's go 'round the back.

24:31.840 --> 24:34.366
The next clue will be inside.

24:40.760 --> 24:45.360
If you recall, the last time we were here
it was a bit of a catastrophe.

24:45.440 --> 24:49.570
Yes. I have a memory
of some slight unpleasantness.

24:54.920 --> 24:56.843
Put these on so we don't get spotted.

24:58.160 --> 25:00.242
Now, just act natural.

25:05.640 --> 25:08.120
- I think that suits you.
- Shh. Focus.

25:08.760 --> 25:11.684
There, you see? We're blending in perfectly.

25:26.400 --> 25:29.210
I'm fairly sure we've been spotted.

25:44.920 --> 25:49.801
Her Highness,
the Grand Empress dowager Pom-Pom!

25:54.960 --> 25:58.360
Empress Pom-Pom remembers you,
Sherlock Gnomes.

25:58.440 --> 26:00.124
Oh, good, good.

26:00.680 --> 26:02.080
Not fondly.

26:02.160 --> 26:04.481
Well, that's less good, isn't it?

26:04.920 --> 26:08.402
I see you got the orchid I sent
to apologize for our last encounter.

26:09.400 --> 26:10.560
A gracious gift.

26:10.640 --> 26:15.009
But you are not the one
who offended the Empress, Sherlock is.

26:15.240 --> 26:19.530
As such, I'm afraid
I must ask you all to leave.

26:19.880 --> 26:21.880
Shake it, shake it, shake it. Out, out, out!

26:21.960 --> 26:23.320
He's very sorry.

26:23.400 --> 26:25.050
Tell her how sorry you are.

26:25.400 --> 26:28.000
I'm sorry that I wasted my time
solving your case.

26:28.080 --> 26:30.800
Now, technically, that was an apology.

26:30.880 --> 26:33.247
Dozens of gnomes are in danger,

26:33.360 --> 26:37.729
so would you kindly step aside
and let me continue my investigation?

26:43.520 --> 26:44.521
No.

26:45.920 --> 26:50.050
Please. We just need to take
a look around. It's very important.

26:50.400 --> 26:52.403
Wait, wait, wait. Let me explain.

26:52.840 --> 26:55.127
Wait. I'm warning you. Back off!

27:05.560 --> 27:06.641
Guards!

27:12.200 --> 27:15.120
Watson, you fend them off.
I'm going clue hunting.

27:15.200 --> 27:16.804
Right. Here we go again.

27:17.120 --> 27:18.920
You help Watson, I'll help Sherlock.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.960
- Oh, great.
- You can handle it.

27:21.040 --> 27:22.929
I was always more of a dog person anyway.

27:26.400 --> 27:29.529
- What are you looking for?
- An assistant who asks fewer questions!

27:30.000 --> 27:32.162
- Are you always this rude?
- That's a question.

27:34.280 --> 27:35.640
That should not be here.

27:35.720 --> 27:39.566
A clock is a terribly offensive gift
in Chinese culture.

27:41.560 --> 27:43.005
How cryptic.

27:44.880 --> 27:46.080
Classic Moriarty.

27:46.160 --> 27:48.040
- A plane? Is that the clue?
- "NV."

27:48.120 --> 27:49.929
All part of Moriarty's game.

27:50.520 --> 27:52.440
Curious. A different pattern.

27:52.520 --> 27:54.284
What's that supposed to mean?
Let me see that.

27:54.400 --> 27:56.560
Miss Juliet, you must trust me.

27:56.640 --> 28:00.531
My methods may be unconventional,
but I will find your family and friends.

28:02.360 --> 28:03.487
We should go.

28:07.840 --> 28:09.126
Other way!

28:17.240 --> 28:18.367
Suction cups.

28:20.520 --> 28:22.921
Paper lanterns. That might work.

28:27.960 --> 28:29.087
Gnomeo!

28:33.640 --> 28:35.051
This way. Hurry up.

28:40.200 --> 28:42.806
Watson, that lamp across the street.

28:48.880 --> 28:51.360
Put these on. Follow me! Quickly now.

29:00.080 --> 29:02.128
You may want to go faster.

29:02.560 --> 29:03.561
Thanks for the tip.

29:08.840 --> 29:09.841
Come on!

29:15.760 --> 29:17.649
Come on! Bring your lanterns.

29:24.600 --> 29:27.604
Get ready with those suction cups.
On my mark.

29:28.520 --> 29:29.840
Wait, what are we doing?

29:29.920 --> 29:31.285
Jumping, of course.

29:37.800 --> 29:40.560
Have you solved the clue?
Where are we going next?

29:40.640 --> 29:43.610
I'll explain later. Right now, just hold on.

29:47.040 --> 29:49.247
We'll have to jump onto that tree!

29:56.560 --> 29:58.800
The Natural History Museum.

29:58.880 --> 30:00.960
The site of our last showdown with Moriarty.

30:01.040 --> 30:03.520
Of course!
That's where the clue is leading us.

30:03.600 --> 30:07.360
Oh, don't be absurd. Moriarty would
never choose such an obvious location.

30:07.440 --> 30:09.640
All right, smart guy, what's your plan?

30:09.720 --> 30:14.160
Well, if you must know, we are going
to the De Jong Modern Art Gallery.

30:14.240 --> 30:17.520
I haven't cracked the latest clue yet,
and the art helps me ruminate.

30:17.600 --> 30:20.080
That's your plan? Art and thinking?

30:20.160 --> 30:22.280
The museum's right there.
Let's just go check it out.

30:22.360 --> 30:26.240
Mate, think about it. You beat this guy
in the museum, and now he wants revenge.

30:26.320 --> 30:30.371
Don't you get it? He's waiting for you
at the museum, he wants a rematch.

30:44.800 --> 30:46.325
Plus, we can get in right there.

30:47.960 --> 30:51.009
Are you...? Is he even listening to me?
He's not listening. Look.

30:52.880 --> 30:56.160
Oh, good, you stopped talking.
Now we can go to the gallery.

30:56.240 --> 30:59.323
You know what? Good luck with that.
We're going to the museum.

30:59.720 --> 31:02.041
Let's just go to the gallery.

31:02.920 --> 31:06.641
Are you serious?
You're seriously choosing him over me?

31:06.760 --> 31:10.680
I'm not choosing anyone. Sherlock knows
this Moriarty guy and you don't.

31:10.760 --> 31:13.525
We're supposed to be a team.
Gnomeo and Juliet, remember?

31:13.640 --> 31:15.051
We are a team.

31:15.400 --> 31:18.609
It doesn't feel like it. It hasn't
felt like it since we moved here.

31:18.960 --> 31:20.325
Oh, Gnomeo.

31:20.640 --> 31:22.688
Are you with me or not?

31:23.600 --> 31:25.011
Don't do this.

31:26.320 --> 31:27.481
And there it is.

31:29.680 --> 31:31.680
Good. Now we can go to the gallery.

31:31.760 --> 31:34.880
- Should we go after him?
- No! No, we should not.

31:34.960 --> 31:36.291
But you may.

31:36.640 --> 31:39.007
Oh, Sherlock Gnomes.

31:39.640 --> 31:41.404
Don't worry. I'll get him back.

32:03.440 --> 32:04.805
Gnomeo!

32:05.240 --> 32:06.446
Gnomeo?

32:09.640 --> 32:11.080
Oh, don't make me say it.

32:11.160 --> 32:13.970
Wherefore art thou, Gnomeo?

32:14.720 --> 32:16.520
- You all right, mate?
- Oh! Cheese and crackers!

32:16.600 --> 32:17.840
Oh, it's just you.

32:18.520 --> 32:20.640
We were hoping you'd join us at the gallery.

32:20.720 --> 32:24.520
Not gonna happen, mate. We are right
about the museum. Let's show 'em.

32:30.360 --> 32:33.120
Why do you keep looking back?
He just severed your partnership.

32:33.200 --> 32:35.680
We didn't break up. It was just a fight.

32:35.760 --> 32:38.560
- Hmm.
- What exactly does "Hmm" mean?

32:38.640 --> 32:40.600
It means you were young and in love,

32:40.680 --> 32:44.321
but your new garden duties were too much
for a young couple to handle.

32:44.440 --> 32:47.120
Likelihood of a breakup: 99%.

32:47.200 --> 32:48.930
99%?

32:49.240 --> 32:50.526
I rounded down.

32:53.080 --> 32:57.244
Look, you just focus on finding my friends
and family. Gnomeo and I will be fine.

33:02.760 --> 33:06.924
- Did you see that?
- No footprints. Of course.

33:08.640 --> 33:09.926
Oh, no. Quickly.

33:13.520 --> 33:14.720
Look, I know you're angry.

33:14.800 --> 33:17.680
How would you feel? It's like
she doesn't even care about me!

33:17.760 --> 33:21.120
A partner who takes you for granted.
Can't think of what that's like.

33:21.200 --> 33:22.800
I don't know how you put up with that gnome.

33:22.880 --> 33:24.840
If we had six months,
I'd list all his faults.

33:24.920 --> 33:28.200
But despite them,
he is a brilliant detective.

33:28.280 --> 33:30.487
We all have our good sides and bad sides.

33:30.880 --> 33:32.769
Sherlock, Miss Juliet...

33:33.240 --> 33:34.082
me.

33:35.840 --> 33:38.120
Do you know what, mate? You're right.
I shouldn't have left her.

33:38.200 --> 33:40.442
I need to go back. I need to make this right.

33:48.120 --> 33:49.360
What is that?

33:50.240 --> 33:54.643
I'm a gargoyle, mate!
Also, your worst nightmare!

33:58.200 --> 33:59.201
Come here!

34:04.320 --> 34:05.845
Go on. Run.

34:07.360 --> 34:10.603
You're never gonna get away
on those stubby little legs!

34:18.800 --> 34:19.960
Up there!

34:26.639 --> 34:28.679
Oi, ugly! Over here!

34:28.760 --> 34:29.806
Go!

34:29.920 --> 34:31.331
Ugly, am I?

34:33.159 --> 34:34.241
Gotcha.

34:35.239 --> 34:37.049
Do you know up close
you're actually quite handsome?

34:39.600 --> 34:41.125
Now. Let's go.

34:52.520 --> 34:53.726
Gnomeo!

35:17.400 --> 35:18.481
Watson.

35:23.040 --> 35:24.167
No.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.449
Come along, Miss Juliet.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.491
We must keep going.

35:36.480 --> 35:38.722
All those gnomes are depending on us.

35:40.360 --> 35:44.160
Sherlock, I don't know what to say.
I can't imagine what you're feeling.

35:44.640 --> 35:47.769
This is the darkest day of my career.

35:48.280 --> 35:52.400
I cannot believe that Moriarty
is working with gargoyles!

35:52.480 --> 35:54.160
Wait, what?

35:54.240 --> 35:57.400
As soon as this case is over,
I must retrieve Watson's map.

35:57.480 --> 36:01.360
That's what you care about?
Gargoyles and some stupid map?

36:01.440 --> 36:03.568
It's one of a kind. In the wrong hands...

36:03.680 --> 36:06.763
Gnomeo got taken. He is gone!

36:07.080 --> 36:10.160
And Watson just got smashed.
Why aren't you sad or angry?

36:10.240 --> 36:13.642
Sadness and anger will not help me
save one single gnome.

36:13.960 --> 36:16.360
Emotion is the enemy of logic.

36:16.440 --> 36:17.960
That is not an answer.

36:18.040 --> 36:20.771
The case can't wait. You can.

37:11.920 --> 37:13.809
Oh, Gnomeo.

37:22.680 --> 37:24.125
Oi! Ronnie!

37:25.080 --> 37:26.286
This one's a handful.

37:26.520 --> 37:28.280
What, I got to babysit?

37:28.360 --> 37:31.648
And you get to do all the creeping
and the kidnapping and fun stuff?

37:31.960 --> 37:34.560
Two words, Reggie: un... fair.

37:34.640 --> 37:38.930
The boss likes me more than he likes you.
I can't help that.

37:42.960 --> 37:44.849
Let me out, you big...

38:01.320 --> 38:03.000
- Gnomeo.
- Mum!

38:03.080 --> 38:06.080
Oh, thank goodness.
Did those awful monsters hurt you?

38:06.160 --> 38:07.360
Mum, I'm fine.

38:07.440 --> 38:09.841
Juliet's not with you.
Where is she? Is she okay?

38:10.080 --> 38:13.800
I don't know. She's still out there.
We split up and I need to get back to her.

38:13.880 --> 38:15.160
She dumped you. I knew it!

38:15.240 --> 38:18.289
I don't know why you thought you could
fix things with a grand romantic gesture.

38:18.400 --> 38:19.920
That is just dumb.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.520
Talk about pulling a Gnomeo!

38:21.600 --> 38:23.480
She didn't dump me, no thanks to you.

38:23.560 --> 38:25.920
Wait. "Pulling a Gnomeo"
means doing something cool.

38:26.000 --> 38:30.005
Oh, yeah. Right. That's totally
how we all use that phrase.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.400
What's going on here?

38:34.480 --> 38:39.043
Apparently gnomes were going missing.
These guys got worried about us.

38:39.320 --> 38:41.209
So they brought us here for safekeeping.

38:42.720 --> 38:46.040
They're gonna take us home
after this Fireworks Night thingy.

38:46.120 --> 38:48.726
Yeah, they even promised us a "big surprise."

38:49.920 --> 38:52.200
They did that when they said it,
which I thought seemed a bit ominous.

38:52.280 --> 38:54.040
Like we weren't gonna get a big surprise...

38:54.120 --> 38:56.920
or if we do, it's gonna be something
really unspeakably horrific.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.650
But it might just be balloons!

38:59.040 --> 39:01.043
Oh, that's great, guys. You go have fun.

39:01.400 --> 39:02.811
<i>Hola,</i> Gnomeo.

39:07.280 --> 39:08.360
We're in trouble.

39:08.440 --> 39:10.560
We know, dear.
We didn't want to worry the others.

39:10.640 --> 39:11.640
How bad is it?

39:11.720 --> 39:15.280
This guy Moriarty,
he's gonna smash us all tomorrow night.

39:15.360 --> 39:16.805
We're going to be smashed?

39:17.880 --> 39:20.167
This guy said we're all going to be
smashed tomorrow!

39:20.520 --> 39:21.806
Smashed?

39:21.920 --> 39:23.570
That's not a very good surprise.

39:25.400 --> 39:28.051
Quiet down... now.

39:28.520 --> 39:32.764
You're giving me a headache.
And I'm not very nice with a headache.

39:42.400 --> 39:45.563
Come on. Miss Juliet, I've got it!
I've cracked...

40:01.840 --> 40:04.047
I believe I've cracked the clue.

40:05.240 --> 40:06.970
Right up the back of my nose.

40:09.040 --> 40:12.240
<i>The circle on the toy plane is a symbol</i>
<i>used by the Royal Air Force.</i>

40:12.320 --> 40:16.360
And the squadron code "NV" said quickly
form the word "envy,"

40:16.440 --> 40:18.640
as in "green with envy".

40:18.720 --> 40:22.042
Which gives us "royal" and "green".

40:23.960 --> 40:26.566
The plane itself
is the last piece of the puzzle...

40:27.000 --> 40:30.960
for the planatus tree, or "plane tree,"
is the most common tree

40:31.040 --> 40:33.043
in Royal Green Park!

40:34.800 --> 40:38.122
It's nearly 9:00. We're running
out of time to save those gnomes.

40:38.440 --> 40:40.120
Sherlock, it's broad daylight.

40:40.200 --> 40:42.965
How are we supposed to get around a park
without anyone seeing us?

40:43.480 --> 40:47.080
Fear not. I am not just
a master of deduction.

40:47.160 --> 40:49.731
I am also a master of disguise.

40:51.600 --> 40:52.601
Sorry.

40:56.640 --> 40:57.840
Come on, let's go.

40:57.920 --> 41:00.969
Left, right. Left, right. Now scurry.

41:01.560 --> 41:02.402
Stop!

41:02.520 --> 41:03.521
Careful.

41:03.960 --> 41:07.442
Now wag your tail. Go on, wag it. Quickly.

41:07.840 --> 41:08.880
Wag it!

41:08.960 --> 41:10.960
Just when I think
you couldn't get more annoying.

41:11.040 --> 41:14.920
Oh, that is the least realistic
tail-wagging I have ever seen.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.560
Forgive me. I've never been
the back end of a squirrel before.

41:17.640 --> 41:19.961
You should have told me that
before I took you on as my assistant.

41:20.080 --> 41:21.200
I'm not your...

41:21.280 --> 41:22.611
Do you hear that?

41:30.720 --> 41:32.080
That's not a bird.

41:32.160 --> 41:34.481
That's the call
of the Peruvian snapping turtle.

41:35.920 --> 41:37.120
Where is it?

41:37.200 --> 41:38.611
Aha!

41:39.600 --> 41:42.680
The Peruvian snapping turtle
is famous for burying its eggs.

41:42.760 --> 41:44.720
He must have buried the clue.

41:44.800 --> 41:47.201
Oh. It's been dug up by...

41:49.360 --> 41:50.885
Don't move.

41:51.360 --> 41:52.800
It's just a dog.

41:52.880 --> 41:54.928
That is no mere dog.

41:55.480 --> 41:59.007
That, my dear, is the hound
owned by the Baskervilles.

41:59.560 --> 42:03.929
And, in this very park,
that very hound bit me!

42:04.040 --> 42:05.770
And I'm siding with the dog here.

42:06.440 --> 42:08.880
First Chinatown, now this fleabag.

42:08.960 --> 42:10.883
This is no coincidence.

42:11.400 --> 42:14.210
Careful. The clue is stuck to a squeaky toy.

42:16.080 --> 42:17.525
Easy does it.

42:20.200 --> 42:21.281
Gently.

42:22.840 --> 42:24.080
Got it.

42:24.400 --> 42:25.561
Quietly now.

42:26.080 --> 42:28.128
And whatever you do, don't...

42:31.720 --> 42:33.609
Good doggy! Good doggy!

42:41.560 --> 42:43.688
- This way!
- No, this way.

42:51.080 --> 42:52.320
Now hold on tight.

43:11.600 --> 43:12.880
Let go!

43:12.960 --> 43:15.805
Who's... a... good... doggy?

43:16.200 --> 43:17.691
Just grab the clue!

43:18.360 --> 43:19.282
Got it!

43:23.480 --> 43:25.005
There. That wasn't so...

43:25.320 --> 43:28.165
bad!

43:37.840 --> 43:39.920
Miss Juliet, for future reference,

43:40.000 --> 43:42.970
that's not how a squirrel wags its tail.

43:43.320 --> 43:44.367
This is.

43:44.880 --> 43:47.531
Do you see what I'm doing? See? Do you see?

43:47.840 --> 43:50.810
Yes, you're acting like a rear end.
Can we check out the clue?

43:53.440 --> 43:55.443
Of course this would be next.

43:55.800 --> 44:00.602
Moriarty, you monster!
Forcing me to face my greatest fears!

44:00.880 --> 44:02.405
A button? Really?

44:02.960 --> 44:05.884
Very well. If he wants to dance,
then dance we shall.

44:20.880 --> 44:22.480
Right. He's asleep.

44:22.560 --> 44:24.280
There must be a way out of here.

44:24.360 --> 44:27.443
The door is locked,
so the only way out is the skylight.

44:27.560 --> 44:29.320
But there's no way to get up there.

44:29.400 --> 44:30.640
There has to be.

44:30.720 --> 44:33.929
I'll do whatever it takes to get us out
and back to Juliet.

44:34.400 --> 44:36.209
I've got an idea. I just need a...

44:36.720 --> 44:38.245
Good boy, Shroom.

44:40.160 --> 44:41.048
All right.

44:42.600 --> 44:46.640
I could scale those bricks,
use the Goons to swing to the beam,

44:46.720 --> 44:50.080
tightrope walk across it,
reach the skylight, get around the door,

44:50.160 --> 44:53.200
open it from the other side
and lead everyone to...

44:53.280 --> 44:58.411
Freedom!

45:02.280 --> 45:03.840
Yeah, thanks, Nanette.

45:03.920 --> 45:07.083
If you're going to escape,
we'll need to create a distraction.

45:12.200 --> 45:13.327
What's going on?

45:16.600 --> 45:21.686
He looks like a fairy-tale princess.
I like fairy tales. Don't tell Reggie.

45:22.000 --> 45:25.209
I believe we've just found our distraction.

45:26.160 --> 45:27.446
What?

45:30.440 --> 45:33.480
The button belongs
to my most formidable rival,

45:33.560 --> 45:36.370
the boss of the scariest dive in London.

45:37.760 --> 45:39.091
The Doll Museum?

45:39.520 --> 45:41.488
The Doll Museum!

45:47.640 --> 45:48.920
Gregson.

45:49.000 --> 45:50.968
You sure you want to come in here?

45:51.480 --> 45:53.369
I need to speak to your boss.

45:58.680 --> 45:59.841
Your funeral.

46:07.640 --> 46:09.320
Yikes! Is that the boss?

46:09.400 --> 46:10.765
Not him.

46:13.840 --> 46:15.171
Nope, not him.

46:17.360 --> 46:18.600
Her.

46:18.680 --> 46:20.922
Sherlock Gnomes.

46:25.840 --> 46:27.570
My favorite arm.

46:28.320 --> 46:30.960
You got a lot of nerve
showing your face around here.

46:31.040 --> 46:32.485
Hello, Irene.

46:32.880 --> 46:35.880
Well, you're looking... well.

46:35.960 --> 46:39.408
A letter!
You ended our engagement in a letter.

46:39.640 --> 46:41.404
You two were engaged?

46:41.960 --> 46:43.600
And now, after months of silence,

46:43.680 --> 46:45.480
you show up with this cheap porcelain thing?

46:45.560 --> 46:47.320
I beg your pardon!

46:47.400 --> 46:49.440
She's just my assistant.

46:49.520 --> 46:51.011
I am not your assistant.

46:51.360 --> 46:52.840
Better get your stories straight.

46:52.920 --> 46:55.924
Irene, this is important.
This is one of yours, isn't it?

46:56.040 --> 46:59.480
I don't know, Sherlock. There's
an awful lot of buttons in this city.

46:59.560 --> 47:02.640
Irene, please, just hand over the clue.

47:02.720 --> 47:05.121
Of course. You're only here on work.

47:05.360 --> 47:08.120
But your case can wait. It's showtime.

47:08.200 --> 47:10.680
See if you can deduce who this song is about.

47:32.720 --> 47:34.720
<i>Do I look like I need you?</i>

47:34.800 --> 47:37.246
<i>I'm super deluxe, new improved</i>

47:37.520 --> 47:39.440
<i>Better shape, better off</i>

47:39.520 --> 47:42.091
<i>Stronger than I ever was</i>

47:42.360 --> 47:46.604
<i>Whispers tell a lie</i>
<i>Starts a rumor, makes you cry</i>

47:46.920 --> 47:48.920
<i>It's out there poster size</i>

47:49.000 --> 47:51.401
<i>It's no secret you're no prize</i>

47:51.880 --> 47:56.040
<i>I'd never, ever take you back</i>
<i>I'd walk on fire and broken glass</i>

47:56.120 --> 47:58.160
<i>It's sister time, I'm here to say</i>

47:58.240 --> 48:00.402
<i>I never really liked you</i>

48:00.760 --> 48:03.525
<i>I never really liked you anyway!</i>

48:03.840 --> 48:06.923
<i>You know you're not messing with me</i>
<i>You know you're not messing with me</i>

48:08.400 --> 48:12.007
<i>You know you're not messing with me</i>
<i>You know you're not messing with me</i>

48:12.720 --> 48:16.327
<i>Get on out, it's no man's land</i>

48:17.160 --> 48:21.290
<i>Gonna set you straight, gotta understand</i>

48:21.880 --> 48:25.680
<i>I'm the queen bee because</i>

48:26.560 --> 48:28.688
<i>I'm stronger than I ever...</i>

48:28.800 --> 48:31.645
<i>Stronger than I ever was!</i>

48:31.760 --> 48:35.120
<i>You know you're not messing with me</i>
<i>You know you're not messing with me</i>

48:35.200 --> 48:36.531
<i>No, no!</i>

48:36.640 --> 48:40.247
<i>You know you're not messing with me</i>
<i>You know you're not messing with me</i>

48:41.280 --> 48:45.400
<i>I'd never, ever take you back</i>
<i>I'd walk on fire and broken glass</i>

48:45.480 --> 48:47.680
<i>It's sister time, I'm here to say</i>

48:47.760 --> 48:50.000
<i>I never really liked you</i>

48:50.080 --> 48:53.562
<i>I never really liked you anyway!</i>

48:58.120 --> 49:00.280
Well, that was rather unpleasant.

49:00.360 --> 49:01.930
Really? I thought she made some good points.

49:02.040 --> 49:04.360
Irene will need
at least one hour to cool down.

49:04.440 --> 49:07.120
We don't have an hour.
Gnomeo is still out there.

49:07.200 --> 49:09.840
Listen up, doll! You've got something I need,

49:09.920 --> 49:11.763
and I'm not leaving here without it.

49:12.360 --> 49:15.569
Are you insane?
You cannot provoke Irene like that.

49:15.680 --> 49:17.045
There's no telling what she'll...

49:23.720 --> 49:25.006
You can come in.

49:28.640 --> 49:30.210
You can't.

49:43.240 --> 49:44.560
Oh, hello.

49:44.640 --> 49:47.400
I thought garden gnomes
were all overweight and bearded.

49:47.480 --> 49:48.971
But you're actually...

49:49.520 --> 49:52.320
cute. Hardly any facial hair at all.

49:52.400 --> 49:53.765
Would you like some tea?

49:58.640 --> 50:00.360
No, thank you. I just want...

50:00.440 --> 50:02.602
I've often wondered
what it's like to be a gnome.

50:03.080 --> 50:07.520
Wearing the same red dress every day
would be like a fashion prison for me.

50:07.600 --> 50:09.921
And living outdoors must be awful!

50:10.440 --> 50:14.730
Standing outside in the rain
and the freezing cold. Like a dog.

50:15.240 --> 50:18.520
I don't really have time for this.
My family are in danger.

50:18.600 --> 50:20.409
Please just hand over the clue.

50:20.720 --> 50:23.840
Work, work, work.
Now I see why Sherlock chose you.

50:23.920 --> 50:25.560
Sherlock didn't "choose" me.

50:25.640 --> 50:29.531
And he never will. With Sherlock,
work always comes first.

50:29.920 --> 50:33.163
There's always another case to crack,
another mystery to solve,

50:33.480 --> 50:35.280
another backyard of gnomes to rescue.

50:35.360 --> 50:38.680
- You don't understand.
- Oh, I understand perfectly.

50:38.760 --> 50:39.648
Enough!

50:40.720 --> 50:43.200
I don't care about Sherlock!

50:43.280 --> 50:46.000
He is the single most annoying gnome
I've ever met.

50:46.080 --> 50:49.289
I wouldn't date Sherlock
if he were the last gnome on earth.

50:49.960 --> 50:53.360
I already have a partner,
and he's nothing like Sherlock.

50:53.440 --> 50:56.171
Gnomeo is reckless and emotional.

50:56.280 --> 51:00.251
And he doesn't treat me like an assistant.
He treats me like I'm...

51:00.640 --> 51:03.246
the toughest gnome in the garden.

51:03.800 --> 51:07.720
He believes in me.
He loves me with all his heart.

51:07.800 --> 51:12.647
And if you asked him to choose
between me and work, or anything really...

51:13.520 --> 51:14.851
he'd choose me.

51:15.880 --> 51:17.041
Every time.

51:19.320 --> 51:20.880
A man doesn't make you strong.

51:20.960 --> 51:23.240
You're right, a man doesn't make you strong.

51:23.320 --> 51:25.891
But the right partner can make you stronger.

51:26.280 --> 51:30.490
But I've let mine down.
And now I need to make it right.

51:32.200 --> 51:34.965
All right. I'll give you what you want.

51:35.160 --> 51:37.760
But only on two conditions. First...

51:37.840 --> 51:40.680
you tell Sherlock this had
absolutely nothing to do with him.

51:40.760 --> 51:41.720
And second?

51:41.800 --> 51:45.202
After you save the day,
you come back and tell me all about it.

51:46.160 --> 51:47.571
Well, you got a deal.

51:50.200 --> 51:52.885
"You already know it's all about you.

51:53.320 --> 51:56.324
So what is the pattern in the final clue?"

51:57.040 --> 51:58.280
The patterns.

51:58.600 --> 52:00.250
Where are they leading us?

52:18.080 --> 52:19.081
I've got it!

52:19.560 --> 52:23.724
Traitors' Gate at the Tower of London,
where Watson and I solved our first case.

52:24.080 --> 52:27.004
But it's on the other side of the city.
We're running out of time!

52:27.560 --> 52:28.687
Let's go!

52:36.600 --> 52:38.840
Ladies and gentle-monsters.

52:38.920 --> 52:42.049
What's going on? What are you guys doing?

52:42.840 --> 52:44.080
What's happening?

52:45.800 --> 52:47.720
All right, lads, let's do this.

52:47.800 --> 52:52.760
The Royal Gnome Theater Company proudly
presents "The Princess and the Frog."

52:52.840 --> 52:54.880
Move out of the way. Let me see.

52:54.960 --> 52:57.645
Hello! Princess Benny is here!

52:58.800 --> 53:00.165
I love fairy tales.

53:00.280 --> 53:04.640
Written and directed by me.
Stage design by me. Lighting by...

53:04.720 --> 53:05.760
Keep going.

53:05.840 --> 53:11.200
Once upon a time, a beautiful princess
tiptoed through the forest

53:11.280 --> 53:15.320
when she came across a prince
who had been cursed by an evil witch.

53:15.400 --> 53:19.640
Alas, cursed am I! Transformed into a frog.

53:19.720 --> 53:21.880
Wait a second,
what is wrong with being a frog?

53:21.960 --> 53:24.240
Oi, Meryl Streep, just read the lines.

53:24.320 --> 53:26.120
This is so frogist.

53:26.200 --> 53:29.921
What can lift this terrible spell?

53:30.240 --> 53:33.369
- You can tell a frog didn't write this.
- Actors. Honestly.

53:36.960 --> 53:39.440
The only way to break the curse
was with a kiss.

53:39.920 --> 53:41.600
Great, they're gonna kiss.

53:41.680 --> 53:43.648
Oh, no, I can't.

53:43.960 --> 53:45.451
Kiss the frog!

53:45.760 --> 53:47.330
Kiss the frog!

53:47.880 --> 53:49.240
Why can't you kiss me?

53:49.320 --> 53:54.122
If you love someone, you only want to
kiss them if they want to kiss you back.

53:54.720 --> 53:58.640
But this isn't the girl you love.
It's just me! Me!

53:58.720 --> 54:00.480
Go on! Kiss the frog!

54:00.560 --> 54:02.802
It is just me. Me!

54:03.400 --> 54:05.160
Me, me, me!

54:05.240 --> 54:07.686
Me! Wait. Oh!

54:09.720 --> 54:11.882
Kiss the frog!

54:21.640 --> 54:22.640
What was that?

54:22.720 --> 54:25.644
Just then, a very handsome suitor arrived.

54:27.440 --> 54:28.680
Who are you?

54:28.760 --> 54:33.640
I am Captain Love, AKA The Love Machine,
AKA Baron Von Kissy-Kissy.

54:33.720 --> 54:35.529
Bunnies, give me a beat.

54:38.320 --> 54:40.800
Watch these moves! Whoo!

54:44.760 --> 54:46.763
Come on, bunnies! Let's party!

54:50.360 --> 54:51.640
Dance with me!

54:51.720 --> 54:52.847
All right.

54:54.120 --> 54:56.771
And whatever you do, don't look behind you.

54:59.920 --> 55:01.126
Yes.

55:01.680 --> 55:02.966
- Oh, no.
- Hurry!

55:07.480 --> 55:09.289
Whoo! Party time!

55:10.520 --> 55:12.320
Ronnie, what is going on?

55:12.400 --> 55:13.920
They're putting on a show.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.162
Showtime's over. Bag them up!

55:16.920 --> 55:20.083
Boss says it's time for their big surprise.

55:32.800 --> 55:34.211
We're too late.

55:35.680 --> 55:37.011
Where are the gnomes?

55:37.640 --> 55:39.643
Show yourself, Moriarty!

55:45.920 --> 55:48.651
No, Sherlock. Not Moriarty.

55:49.280 --> 55:50.407
Watson?

55:51.000 --> 55:53.287
But... that's impossible.

55:53.720 --> 55:56.485
Not impossible. Merely improbable.

55:56.920 --> 56:00.481
It wasn't an M. It was a W, for Watson.

56:01.000 --> 56:03.685
But I knew you'd miss that.
Because it had to do with me.

56:04.680 --> 56:06.125
This was my game.

56:08.400 --> 56:11.920
But we saw you fall! We saw you get smashed!

56:12.000 --> 56:14.526
No. You heard me get smashed.

56:18.160 --> 56:20.000
I caught myself before I landed.

56:20.080 --> 56:21.650
As for the sound you heard...

56:22.920 --> 56:24.001
just a flowerpot.

56:24.800 --> 56:28.120
What have you done with the gnomes?
What have you done with Gnomeo?

56:28.200 --> 56:30.800
They're all fine.
They're right behind that door.

56:30.880 --> 56:33.520
Miss Juliet, I am sorry
I had to involve your garden.

56:33.600 --> 56:36.524
But this was the only way
to get through to Sherlock.

56:37.320 --> 56:39.243
You did all this?

56:39.920 --> 56:41.445
But why?

56:41.800 --> 56:43.484
Because we used to be a team.

56:43.840 --> 56:47.367
Sherlock and Watson, friends,
partners in crime-solving.

56:47.680 --> 56:49.887
But over time, you stopped respecting me.

56:50.240 --> 56:53.130
The only ornament you respected was Moriarty.

56:54.080 --> 56:56.440
There was only one way
I could prove myself to you:

56:56.520 --> 56:59.000
I had to pretend to be Moriarty.

56:59.640 --> 57:03.520
I orchestrated this game.
I challenged you to a battle of wits.

57:03.600 --> 57:06.206
And you won. You beat me.

57:07.680 --> 57:09.648
That's all I wanted to hear.

57:10.200 --> 57:13.010
And now you and I are finished.

57:13.640 --> 57:16.564
Maybe you'll treat your next partner
a little better.

57:17.480 --> 57:21.560
Yeah, when you two have quite finished,
can we please free the gnomes now?

57:21.640 --> 57:24.291
Of course. With my apologies.

57:26.120 --> 57:27.840
Since my friends live here at Traitors' Gate,

57:27.920 --> 57:30.605
this was the best place to ensure
the gnomes would be safe.

57:31.040 --> 57:32.960
I designed the room to be
as pleasant as possible.

57:33.040 --> 57:34.531
They've even got mini-golf.

57:35.240 --> 57:38.164
Gnomeo! Dad! Nanette!

57:39.480 --> 57:40.840
Where are they?

57:40.920 --> 57:42.729
Not here. Never were.

57:43.360 --> 57:44.840
What do you mean? What's going on?

57:44.920 --> 57:47.400
Ronnie, why don't you enlighten
our small friend.

57:47.480 --> 57:51.201
Here's the thing, mate.
We don't actually work for you.

57:51.320 --> 57:52.560
What are you talking about?

57:52.640 --> 57:54.131
Sherlock! Do something!

57:54.920 --> 57:56.490
Look at you.

58:01.800 --> 58:03.086
What a loser.

58:07.920 --> 58:10.127
No. No! You can't do this.

58:30.240 --> 58:33.164
What's happening? Where are they taking us?

58:33.480 --> 58:36.370
I don't know. The gnomes,
they were supposed to be there!

58:36.840 --> 58:38.680
Sherlock. Sherlock!

58:38.760 --> 58:41.843
For goodness sake,
will you please just say something?

58:42.920 --> 58:44.160
Limestone.

58:44.240 --> 58:47.280
- He meant say something useful.
- I just did.

58:47.360 --> 58:50.364
The substance on my shoe, it's limestone.

58:50.880 --> 58:53.480
The gargoyles lied.
They are not from Traitors' Gate.

58:53.560 --> 58:56.160
So, if we can deduce
where they're really from...

58:56.240 --> 58:57.480
We'll find the gnomes.

58:57.760 --> 59:01.481
That's why I kicked him. To see
quite literally what he was made of.

59:02.200 --> 59:06.330
The gargoyles also reeked of salt.
Here, taste my shoe.

59:06.760 --> 59:08.490
No. Just keep going.

59:08.680 --> 59:10.842
So the gargoyles must live close to water.

59:11.160 --> 59:14.642
Now, place your hands on this wall.
Do you feel that?

59:14.880 --> 59:19.280
That is the steady thrum of
a marine propulsion engine, meaning...

59:19.360 --> 59:23.843
- We're on a ship.
- The HMS Nimrod, to be precise.

59:24.320 --> 59:26.520
We've just set sail, headed east,

59:26.600 --> 59:29.760
directly towards a structure
which is both on the water

59:29.840 --> 59:32.411
and protected by limestone gargoyles.

59:32.920 --> 59:36.607
Tower Bridge!
The gnomes must be hidden inside.

59:37.880 --> 59:41.640
Oh, no. Now I understand
why he put us on this ship.

59:41.720 --> 59:44.690
Wait. What? Who put us on this ship?

59:55.480 --> 59:58.404
That's impossible. He was smashed. I saw it.

59:58.800 --> 01:00:00.640
<i>Surprise, Sherlock!</i>

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:03.485
<i>Sorry to not be in touch.</i>
<i>I was pretending to be dead.</i>

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:05.640
<i>Oh, also, I hate you.</i>

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:08.040
Moriarty, how awful to see you.

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:11.200
<i>So how have I been? I've been just peachy!</i>

01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:14.560
<i>Took up fishing. Gave up fishing.</i>
<i>It's really boring.</i>

01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:17.564
<i>But I did plot your destruction</i>
<i>with the help of my friends here.</i>

01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:20.560
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>they were actually working for me!</i>

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:24.760
<i>I mean, I came up with the Sistine Chapel</i>
<i>of evil plans.</i>

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:29.289
<i>It's got a double-cross, a triple-cross,</i>
<i>I was smashed, he was smashed.</i>

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:32.322
<i>I mean, to be fair,</i>
<i>it is needlessly complicated,</i>

01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:34.408
<i>but that's what supervillains do!</i>

01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:36.600
I know you like it
when you think I don't understand,

01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:38.920
but this time I really don't understand.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.400
What happened at the Natural History Museum?

01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:44.245
<i>Well, now that's a funny story.</i>

01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:47.640
<i>You thought I was deaded.</i>

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:52.328
<i>But I've always been a lucky pie,</i>
<i>and that was my luckiest day ever.</i>

01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:55.445
<i>Not only did I not get squished...</i>

01:00:55.920 --> 01:01:00.323
<i>in that moment I saw how I could</i>
<i>finally bring you down, Sherlock.</i>

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:04.685
- Yours, I believe.
<i>- I saw how you treated Watson.</i>

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:08.320
<i>Poor old miserabubble Watson.</i>
<i>He looked so sad.</i>

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:10.209
<i>So I thought, I'll use that.</i>

01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:13.962
<i>I sent the gargoyles to you, Watson,</i>
<i>and they let you think you were in charge.</i>

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:15.890
<i>As if!</i>

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:19.888
<i>Know what your problem is, Watson?</i>
<i>You're too nice, too trusting.</i>

01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:21.800
<i>Too...</i>

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:25.407
<i>Never trust a gargoyle</i>
<i>or prunes past their sell-by date.</i>

01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:30.600
<i>While you were playing at supervillains,</i>
<i>I saw your map.</i>

01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:33.600
<i>Then I could carry out</i>
<i>the real plan, my plan!</i>

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:37.241
<i>Capturing every single gnome in London.</i>

01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:40.880
<i>Selfie time!</i>

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:42.246
Oh, no.

01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:44.285
<i>Oh, yes!</i>

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:46.360
<i>They didn't have to be glued down</i>
<i>in a giant M,</i>

01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:50.286
<i>but it's the little touches that make</i>
<i>a plan really evil, you know?</i>

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:52.405
He's not there.

01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:55.240
<i>Can you guess what happens next?</i>
<i>Here, I'll show you.</i>

01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:58.369
<i>Screen share, screen share.</i>
<i>How do I screen...?</i>

01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:04.485
<i>This is where we stored</i>
<i>the kidnapped gnomes on the bridge.</i>

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:07.725
<i>Then we brought them to this room here,</i>
<i>for the main event.</i>

01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:09.760
<i>And when your warship arrives,</i>

01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:14.721
<i>the bridge will rise up</i>
<i>and the 500-ton counterweight will fall...</i>

01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:18.640
<i>crushing the gnomes,</i>
<i>making you the very instrument</i>

01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:20.160
<i>of their demise.</i>

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:22.360
<i>Yes, you, Sherlock,</i>

01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:27.571
<i>will be the unwitting executioner</i>
<i>of every single gnome in London.</i>

01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:30.966
<i>So, how do I get out of screen share?</i>

01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:35.880
<i>Oh, aha! Oh, Sherlock,</i>
<i>I can see all the cogs turning in there,</i>

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:38.531
trying to work out how to stop me.
But it's too late.

01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:41.605
Your pretty boat is nearly here.

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:49.000
<i>The bridge will open</i>
<i>Smashing all the gnomes</i>

01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:51.651
<i>And what will you do, Sherlock</i>
<i>When all the gnomes are gone?</i>

01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:53.883
I don't know. You tell me.

01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:58.610
So the game is not afoot, or a hand,
or a leg. It's just over.

01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:00.371
And you lose.

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:02.165
Bye!

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:15.040
So, Watson, on a scale of 1 to 10,
how well do you think this is going?

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:17.560
I never meant for any gnome
to get hurt. You know that.

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:19.560
Hey, knock it off, both of you.

01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:22.291
- Watson screwed up, but you did, too.
- What did I do?

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:27.000
The same thing I did. We took our best
friends for granted, we stopped listening.

01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:29.000
We stopped giving them
the respect they deserve.

01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:32.721
They were the last thing we were thinking
about, they should have been the first.

01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:42.528
I suppose somewhere within that
haystack of emotional twaddle

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:45.725
there may lie a thin needle of truth.

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:47.560
One last case.

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:50.406
One last case.

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:51.927
Good.

01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:57.967
Now let's get off this ship
and save those gnomes.

01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:02.961
Let's go.

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:05.881
It's all clear.

01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:09.921
Follow me.

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:11.961
We need that soap.

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:14.846
Of course, to unstick the gnomes
from the pie filling.

01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:19.165
Perfect deduction, Watson. Now we need
to find a way to get to Tower Bridge.

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:23.161
I'll drive.

01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:31.771
Miss Juliet, maybe we should slow down!

01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:42.165
What are we doing up here?
Shouldn't we be saving the gnomes?

01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:44.800
The only way to save the gnomes

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:46.962
is to find a way to stop the bridge
from opening.

01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:52.360
<i>Clear the bridge. Clear the bridge.</i>

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:55.285
<i>All pedestrians behind the barriers.</i>

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:04.720
HMS Nimrod, this is Tower Bridge.

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:07.645
Commencing your 20:43 bridge lift.

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:32.411
We got to make them think there's still
people on the bridge. Can you handle that?

01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:35.880
Absolutely, definitely.
Positively. Piece of cake.

01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:37.928
Yes! I must go down and help the others.

01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:40.120
- So, what are we doing?
- I don't know.

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:42.000
Well, we got to do something.

01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:43.400
Well, we are on a river.

01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:44.891
Five, six, seven, eight!

01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:52.527
Bloomin' heck!
There's still people on the bridge.

01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:01.440
Nimrod, stop your approach.

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:04.770
<i>There are some people on the bridge...</i>
<i>Riverdancing!</i>

01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:07.321
Sherlock!

01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:11.400
And this is why you don't make
the gloating phone call

01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:13.881
until after all the gnomes are smashed.

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:18.484
Can you be a lamb and get me a weapon?
Something lethal but... fun!

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:29.930
Look! Someone must have stopped the bridge!

01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:31.841
Gnomeo.

01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:40.726
"Move to the city," they said.
"It'll be fun," they said.

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:44.120
Sherlock!

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:47.329
Surely you didn't think
it would be that easy...

01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:49.800
Who the heck are you?

01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:51.848
- I'm the gnome that's gonna...
- No!

01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:56.760
This is my show! I do the one-liners.
You don't get one-liners.

01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:59.800
It seems we have a party crasher.
Would you two show him the door?

01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:03.120
It'll be our pleasure, guv'nor.
This is too easy.

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:06.170
- He's mine.
- No, he's mine.

01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:08.000
Wait. What are you doing?

01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:09.525
Jumping, of course.

01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:13.921
Gotcha.

01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:21.648
Oh, Gnomeo, I'm so sorry.
I thought I'd lost you.

01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:23.285
That's never gonna happen.

01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:27.601
Look!

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:33.440
Ah, yes. Not good. Would you take care
of them so we can save the gnomes?

01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:35.204
Leave it with us. Good luck.

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:38.846
Fertilizer face! Remember me?

01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:40.360
Come here, pipsqueak!

01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:41.885
Wait till I get hold of you!

01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:48.120
<i>My name is Moriarty</i>
<i>You like to eat my pies</i>

01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:51.000
I'll draw his fire, you rescue the gnomes.

01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:52.440
You trust me to save the gnomes?

01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:54.329
Well, of course. You're Watson.

01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:03.840
Sherlock!

01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:08.084
Surely you didn't think
it would be that... easy... to...

01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:13.329
You know what? It doesn't feel organic
anymore. Look, I'm just gonna smash you.

01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:16.840
Ha! A miss! The first of many.

01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:20.481
It's my favorite bit. The chase.
Ready or not, here I come!

01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:23.881
Cheese and crackers!

01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:31.319
Look! It's that guy that hangs around
with Sherlock.

01:08:31.399 --> 01:08:34.279
Yes, I'm the guy that hangs around
with Sherlock.

01:08:34.359 --> 01:08:36.203
And I'm here to get you out.

01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:41.961
Here we go.

01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:57.520
Hey! Why is he pouring soap on us?

01:08:57.920 --> 01:08:59.479
I don't know. Still, we'll smell nice.

01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:01.448
He's trying to get us loose.

01:09:02.439 --> 01:09:03.930
Everyone get ready to move.

01:09:14.319 --> 01:09:16.687
Everyone link arms and pull!

01:09:17.479 --> 01:09:19.846
Foam party!

01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:24.760
It pains me to do this, Sherlock.

01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:26.921
No one is forcing you, Moriarty.

01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:29.760
You're the only one who gets me.

01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:32.319
<i>And I know you feel the same way about me!</i>

01:09:32.399 --> 01:09:33.640
Not true!

01:09:35.439 --> 01:09:36.930
I know you, Sherlock.

01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:40.920
Because I know me. We are the same.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.880
<i>You are the sun and I am the moon!</i>

01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:46.200
Those aren't the same.

01:09:46.439 --> 01:09:49.808
They're both round things...
Look, you know what I mean.

01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:59.000
They've got to be here somewhere.

01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:00.002
There!

01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:03.290
Don't just stand there! Get her!

01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:12.930
She's trapped.

01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:21.920
Oh, dear. You've got
nowhere else to go, twinkletoes.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.081
Now!

01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:26.360
<i>What was that?</i>

01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:29.480
<i>Point the searchlight at the bridge.</i>

01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:32.484
The humans! They've seen us! Freeze!

01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:37.130
- This is your fault.
- No, it's your fault.

01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:47.960
Two garden gnomes versus
two giant stone gargoyles.

01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:51.727
Hey, we're Gnomeo and Juliet.
They didn't stand a chance.

01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:54.444
You've got to be kidding me.

01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:56.920
False alarm, Nimrod.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:00.400
Someone had stuck three garden gnomes
on the... bridge.

01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:02.448
Looked like they were dancing.
It doesn't matter.

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:04.928
Stand by for bridge reopening.

01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:06.400
Oh, no.

01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:09.360
Yeah, we didn't even get
to do our big finale. What?

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:12.171
<i>Nimrod, recommencing bridge opening now.</i>

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:19.728
Don't worry, I'll get you out of here.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.411
Oh, my hero.

01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:25.805
Be brave, my love. Be brave!

01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:28.202
This way! The door's here!

01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:31.800
Come on, quickly now!

01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:34.320
Help! Help! I'm stuck!

01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:36.289
Well, of course it would be that guy.

01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:45.481
Whoa! Keep me level!

01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:49.006
Come on, this way. Out, everybody.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.520
Thank you, Dr. Watson.

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:55.251
- Thank you, Dr. Watson.
- You're my hero, Dr. Watson.

01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:05.083
I don't need you, Sherlock. I've got lots
of people who want me as an archenemy.

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:07.570
They're queuing up!

01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:13.725
I'm popular and bubbly.

01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:21.971
I'm a pie about town.

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:27.921
You know, you're very needy for a villain.

01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:33.200
The bridge is up. The gnomes are smashed.

01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:36.887
And I guess this is the end
of our little story, Sherlock.

01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:39.164
Come now, Moriarty.

01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:43.128
I think there's one more twist in the tale.

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:45.160
No!

01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:47.841
You're past your sell-by date, Moriarty.

01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:52.840
You saved them? My life's work ruined?

01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:55.400
The Sistine Chapel of evil plans

01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:58.960
and you just spray-painted
a cartoon cat all over it!

01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:02.488
Well, then, sir, my hat's off to you.

01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:04.165
Literally.

01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:06.641
No!

01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:09.770
Brace yourselves!

01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:16.963
Oh, Sherlock. You look tired.

01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:22.320
Why don't you have a little lie-down
while I go and chat to your friends.

01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:24.289
Yeah. Back in a sec.

01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:29.080
And lift!

01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:30.120
Again!

01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:31.645
Watson, behind you!

01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:33.206
Hello!

01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:40.928
Poor old miserabubble Watson.

01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:43.851
- Okay, bye-bye!
- No, Moriarty. Please.

01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:50.208
Give it up, Sherlock.
What you gonna do, depress me to death?

01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:53.121
This is where our story ends.

01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:58.248
Come, Moriarty. Come dance with me.

01:13:58.560 --> 01:13:59.687
Oh, big hairy bums!

01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:03.370
Sherlock!

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:16.122
Ow!

01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:23.368
Sherlock Gnomes, I shall...

01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:28.322
This water is disgusting. Oh, it's going
in my mouth! It's going in my mouth!

01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:30.684
Oh, no, my phone!

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.331
You'd give your life for me?

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:41.760
Of course.

01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:44.571
Because you're the sworn protector
of London's garden gnomes.

01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:49.920
No. Because we are the sworn protectors
of London's garden gnomes.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:53.721
Watson and Sherlock, partners and friends.

01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:57.369
And I promise
to treat my partner a lot better.

01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:01.646
That is, of course, if you'll have me back.

01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:06.251
Watson and Sherlock.
I rather like the sound of that.

01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:21.720
So, Benny, you know how you said

01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:24.451
you only want to kiss someone
if they want to kiss you back?

01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:27.806
Well, now is that time.

01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:34.360
Where did you learn to kiss like that?

01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:35.601
The Internet.

01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:39.840
Not bad for our first week in London.

01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:42.000
You're the one who wanted an adventure.

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:44.481
Yeah, with you. Always with you.

01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:06.120
What a perfect spring day.

01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:09.602
The garden looks absolutely glorious.

01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:13.400
It truly does. Juliet, I am so proud of you.

01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:14.845
Thanks, Dad.

01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:21.840
Watson!

01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:24.730
Oh, Sherlock. I didn't even see you there.

01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:28.007
Yes. I suppose I deserve that.

01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:29.930
<i>This is nice!</i>

01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:31.161
<i>Yes</i>

01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:33.802
<i>When do we attack?</i>

01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:39.560
On this day, the first day of spring,

01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:42.440
we are here to celebrate our new leaders...

01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:45.046
Gnomeo and Juliet.

01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:49.930
Is this what I think it is?

01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:52.930
A Cupid's Arrow Orchid. Our flower.

01:16:56.880 --> 01:17:00.043
So I guess this is officially our garden now.

01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:04.969
It is. And I'll never forget the most
important thing in this garden is you.

01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:07.680
That was super cheesy.

01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:10.520
No, it was extremely romantic.

01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:13.080
- Grade-A cheddar.
- Will you shut up and kiss me?

01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:28.521
What?

01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:33.323
Watson, do you see
how they look at one another?

01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:37.491
Recalculating likelihood of breakup at 0%.

01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:39.730
Could that possibly be right?

01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:43.881
Elementary, my dear Sherlock. Elementary.

01:25:58.280 --> 01:25:59.247
Ow!

01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:01.763
I hate you, Sherlock Gnomes.

01:26:02.305 --> 01:26:08.735
