WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:05.400
This programme contains
some strong language from the start,

00:05.400 --> 00:08.320
scenes which some viewers
may find upsetting

00:08.320 --> 00:10.680
and discriminatory language.

00:10.680 --> 00:12.480
HE SNORES

00:23.400 --> 00:27.520
PHONE BUZZES

00:31.480 --> 00:32.840
Fuck.

00:34.840 --> 00:35.960
Shit!

00:39.120 --> 00:41.920
Hello?  Hi, Adam.

00:41.920 --> 00:44.680
It's Shruti, one of the SHOs.
Sorry to disturb you.

00:44.680 --> 00:47.480
Erm, you're on the rota
for labour ward today,

00:47.480 --> 00:50.080
and Mr Lockhart...
Er, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:50.080 --> 00:52.800
Erm, tell him I'm really sorry.

00:52.800 --> 00:55.520
I think there's been an accident.
I've been sat here for an hour...

00:56.560 --> 00:57.800
HE GROANS

00:59.360 --> 01:00.920
And I'll be there in a minute.

01:02.640 --> 01:04.600
Well, I'm not dead, am I?

01:04.600 --> 01:07.120
Please tell me
you haven't ordered a coffin.

01:07.120 --> 01:10.280
Of course I'm not having
an affair. I wouldn't have the time.

01:10.280 --> 01:13.800
I just fell asleep last night
when I went to the car.

01:13.800 --> 01:16.640
Who did you phone? Please tell me
you haven't phoned the police.

01:16.640 --> 01:18.440
Well, who did you phone, then?

01:18.440 --> 01:20.000
Oh, sorry.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.240
Who did you phone, then?

01:22.440 --> 01:24.080
My mum?!

01:25.520 --> 01:27.960
Shit. Are you deranged?

01:27.960 --> 01:29.960
And what did she...?

01:29.960 --> 01:32.160
SHE CRIES OUT

01:32.160 --> 01:34.840
Don't go anywhere. I'm going
to call you right back.

01:34.840 --> 01:37.000
Is coming out!

01:37.000 --> 01:38.520
Is coming out!

01:38.520 --> 01:40.960
Well, a stroke of luck,
you've come to the right place.

01:40.960 --> 01:42.640
Let's get you up to
labour ward, shall we?

01:42.640 --> 01:44.440
It's, erm, a bit of a walk,
I'm afraid.

01:44.440 --> 01:45.840
SHE CRIES OUT

01:45.840 --> 01:48.120
Do you mind if I have
a quick check?

01:48.120 --> 01:49.920
I'm a doctor.
Probably should have said.

01:49.920 --> 01:51.360
I'm Adam. And you are...?

01:51.360 --> 01:53.200
Andrea.  Andrea.

01:53.200 --> 01:54.840
SHE GASPS

01:56.240 --> 02:01.800
OK. OK, Andrea, so, erm, baby's arm

02:01.800 --> 02:04.320
has come out.  That is normal?

02:05.440 --> 02:08.280
Take a wild guess.
Baby is lying sideways.

02:08.280 --> 02:10.880
Do you understand that? Sideways?

02:10.880 --> 02:13.560
So you need a Caesarean section.
Oh, Caesarean.

02:13.560 --> 02:16.160
I've got a scalpel in my
back pocket. You'll be fine.

02:16.160 --> 02:17.520
Shall we go?

02:17.520 --> 02:19.760
Yeah.  Yeah? That's it.

02:21.440 --> 02:23.520
That's it. You OK?

02:23.520 --> 02:26.960
Erm, Andrea, I know a short cut.
Let's go this way.

02:26.960 --> 02:28.680
I don't want to hurry you, Andrea,

02:28.680 --> 02:31.160
but we've got to get going.
You're doing brilliantly.

02:31.160 --> 02:33.400
It's OK. Deep breaths.
PORTER:  Mind yourselves!

02:33.400 --> 02:35.480
Come on, then, quickly. Hurry up.

02:35.480 --> 02:38.160
SHE CRIES OUT
That's it, we're nearly there.

02:38.160 --> 02:40.120
We're going to go up in
the staff lift.

02:40.120 --> 02:41.360
Nearly there, nearly there.

02:42.680 --> 02:46.200
Come on.  This is lift?
It's safe. Come on.

02:46.200 --> 02:49.080
Really?  Yeah. You can do it.
I can't!

02:49.080 --> 02:50.680
No, wait. Wait, wait.

02:50.680 --> 02:53.200
Wait for it. No, no, no.
OK, are you ready?

02:53.200 --> 02:56.000
Three, two, one. SHE CRIES OUT

02:56.000 --> 02:58.520
Keep breathing.
Nice deep breaths.

02:58.520 --> 03:00.760
When I say so, we're going to
jump out of the lift.

03:00.760 --> 03:02.160
Are you a real doctor?

03:02.160 --> 03:03.800
Fair question...

03:03.800 --> 03:05.960
..though, strangely,
one you've asked me

03:05.960 --> 03:07.680
after you showed me your vagina.

03:07.680 --> 03:10.520
Right, there you go. Yes?

03:10.520 --> 03:12.680
OK, so, let's get ready.

03:12.680 --> 03:14.720
Get ready.

03:14.720 --> 03:17.400
And jump! Don't worry, don't worry.

03:17.400 --> 03:20.120
The lift will go round
and we'll have another go.

03:21.360 --> 03:23.960
You're doing really well.
What's happening?

03:23.960 --> 03:25.600
It's just going through the...

03:25.600 --> 03:27.400
..through the roof bit
before it goes down.

03:27.400 --> 03:28.440
CLANGING

03:28.440 --> 03:30.360
All right?
It'll be light again soon.

03:30.360 --> 03:32.520
Something's wrong! Look!  OK.

03:33.960 --> 03:36.200
Jesus Christ.
We call this a cord prolapse.

03:36.200 --> 03:38.880
Ideally, it would happen on labour
ward, not in a mad lift.

03:38.880 --> 03:41.480
OK, Andrea,
everything's going to be fine.

03:41.480 --> 03:43.000
I mean, it might be fine.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.520
If the cord gets cold,
then baby stops getting blood.

03:45.520 --> 03:47.480
No more blood, no more baby.

03:47.480 --> 03:50.360
Right, hold it inside.
You understand? Inside.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.040
Yeah.  Come on, come on, come on.

03:52.040 --> 03:54.400
Are you the SHO? Staff lifts now.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.280
Bring a hospital bed
and a box of gloves.

03:56.280 --> 03:58.520
Literally now. Cord prolapse.

03:58.520 --> 04:00.840
SHE CRIES OUT Right, come on, Andrea,

04:00.840 --> 04:02.320
we need to get off. Get ready.

04:02.320 --> 04:05.040
And jump! Jump! Jump!
Can't!  Fuck it.

04:05.040 --> 04:06.560
Come on. OK?

04:06.560 --> 04:08.480
ANDREA SCREAMS

04:09.560 --> 04:11.120
Andrea, stay there.

04:12.360 --> 04:14.760
Get her up on the bed.
Knee-elbow position,

04:14.760 --> 04:16.560
replace the cord,
get her round to theatre.

04:16.560 --> 04:18.760
I'm going to change into some
scrubs. You consent her.

04:18.760 --> 04:21.400
Consent her for...?
A deep-tissue massage.

04:21.400 --> 04:23.240
It's a cord prolapse!

04:23.240 --> 04:25.480
Caesarean!  Oh, well, when you say,

04:25.480 --> 04:28.040
"knee-elbow position"...

04:28.040 --> 04:29.400
My mistake, sorry.

04:29.400 --> 04:31.480
Your outfit looks a lot like
what the doctors wear.

04:31.480 --> 04:32.840
ANDREA SCREAMS

04:32.840 --> 04:34.120
I'll do this. You push the bed.

04:34.120 --> 04:35.480
Get up on here. That's it.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.280
A bit less Alton Towers.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.920
I'm so sorry.

04:41.920 --> 04:43.520
Why don't I drive?

04:43.520 --> 04:45.000
You go and find the anaesthetist.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.040
That's the doctor
that makes you go sleep-sleep.

04:47.040 --> 04:48.720
SHE GROANS

04:48.720 --> 04:50.040
I've found the husband.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.560
He's just coming up from reception.

04:51.560 --> 04:54.400
OK, Andrea, this is going to be
fine. You'll have a baby

04:54.400 --> 04:57.400
in five minutes.  And is free?
Yep, free. Completely free.

04:57.400 --> 04:59.080
We're not even allowed
to accept tips.

04:59.080 --> 05:00.600
SHE GASPS

05:00.600 --> 05:02.800
Dr Adam, you should see me next.
It's really urgent.

05:02.800 --> 05:05.240
Really?  Erika, darling, can you just
take a seat for me, please?

05:05.240 --> 05:08.800
Tracy! How was Majorca?
Did Mick like the hotel?

05:08.800 --> 05:10.480
Erika, just go back to triage.

05:10.480 --> 05:12.000
HE SPEAKS ROMANIAN

05:12.000 --> 05:13.720
I did explain that the doctor
would be

05:13.720 --> 05:15.880
holding the cord inside. HE SPEAKS ROMANIAN

05:15.880 --> 05:18.360
Probably didn't tell him I'd be
wearing her like Kermit the Frog.

05:18.360 --> 05:19.760
I don't understand.

05:19.760 --> 05:24.080
That's baby's heartbeat.
Welcome to the NHS.

05:24.080 --> 05:26.480
ANDREA CRIES OUT

05:26.480 --> 05:28.480
BABY CRIES

05:33.360 --> 05:34.920
This is obs and gynae.

05:35.920 --> 05:37.440
Also known as brats and twats.

05:39.360 --> 05:41.600
You're generally
sailing the ship alone...

05:42.640 --> 05:45.320
..a ship that's massive
and on fire and no-one's had

05:45.320 --> 05:46.960
the time to teach you how to sail.

05:48.320 --> 05:50.640
It's literally life or death here.

05:50.640 --> 05:53.840
And you're constantly being
splashed by bodily fluids.

05:53.840 --> 05:55.680
Not even the fun kind.

05:59.040 --> 06:02.200
But what other doctors can say they
end up with twice the number of

06:02.200 --> 06:04.320
patients they started with?

06:04.320 --> 06:06.280
Beat that, geriatrics.

06:08.760 --> 06:10.640
Clothes bill means I'm...

06:10.640 --> 06:12.880
..probably running my job
at a loss, though.

06:25.800 --> 06:28.760
Ah, Mr Lockhart.  Having fun there?

06:28.760 --> 06:32.160
I was just...  Yeah, I'm not entirely
convinced I want to know.

06:32.160 --> 06:34.240
I don't know if you heard,
there was a massive

06:34.240 --> 06:35.840
cord prolapse before.

06:35.840 --> 06:38.600
Erm, crash section.
Got the baby out in 90 seconds.

06:38.600 --> 06:41.200
I heard that you rocked up
ten minutes late,

06:41.200 --> 06:43.760
nearly killed a patient
in the maintenance lift,

06:43.760 --> 06:46.880
then did a Caesarean section
in casualwear.

06:46.880 --> 06:48.760
It was more that I took
a short cut.

06:48.760 --> 06:51.240
Doctors aren't meant to take
short cuts, Adam.

06:51.240 --> 06:53.360
Remember when I asked you
to be an acting registrar?

06:53.360 --> 06:56.600
Can you try acting like
a bloody registrar?

06:56.600 --> 06:59.160
I'll be in my office
if you need me,

06:59.160 --> 07:01.240
which I strongly suggest you won't.

07:03.600 --> 07:04.800
You've missed a bit.

07:09.160 --> 07:12.120
SCREAMING

07:14.880 --> 07:16.880
PORTER:  Mind out, please, mind out.

07:26.800 --> 07:30.200
WOMAN:  It's really urgent!
I know, petal, but I promise you

07:30.200 --> 07:31.920
the doctor won't be long.
Pinkie promise?

07:31.920 --> 07:34.120
Pinkie promise with a little cherry
on top.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.920
Oh!

07:35.920 --> 07:38.480
Why don't you head back
to where you were sitting?

07:41.280 --> 07:44.080
Moany old trout.  Morning, Ria.
Morning, Dr Kay.

07:44.080 --> 07:46.200
Oh, there he is!  Ward round, Trace?

07:46.200 --> 07:48.160
Can I ask you
something personal, darling?

07:48.160 --> 07:50.000
Is it, "Why do you look
like shit this morning?"

07:50.000 --> 07:51.360
I wasn't going to ask it like that.

07:51.360 --> 07:52.760
I slept in my car last night.

07:52.760 --> 07:56.520
Well, it must be hard
maintaining a relationship,

07:56.520 --> 07:58.320
what, with your job...

07:58.320 --> 08:00.840
..and your personality.

08:00.840 --> 08:03.400
Tracy's the head midwife
on today.

08:03.400 --> 08:05.560
I'd let her sew up
my sister's perineum...

08:06.680 --> 08:08.440
..which sounds weird,
now that I've said it,

08:08.440 --> 08:10.240
but it's actually the highest
compliment I can give.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.720
Oh, remember to remove the thick,
shiny layer on the outside.

08:12.720 --> 08:15.960
Ignore him. His girlfriend's come to
her senses and dumped him.

08:15.960 --> 08:18.760
No-one's dumped anyone.
But if you do want to smack him,

08:18.760 --> 08:20.560
I will turn a blind eye.

08:20.560 --> 08:22.720
Do you mind if we
nip to Room 8 first?

08:22.720 --> 08:25.200
She's making pretty slow progress.

08:25.200 --> 08:28.240
Pop downstairs and review
Mrs Buckstar quickly.

08:28.240 --> 08:30.680
Doctors speak a lot of code,
so it's "epididymo-orchitis"

08:30.680 --> 08:32.880
rather than "gammy cock and balls".

08:32.880 --> 08:34.760
"Review Mrs Buckstar,"
"Go to Starbucks."

08:34.760 --> 08:36.200
Which ward is Mrs Buckstar in?

08:36.200 --> 08:38.680
He wants you to get him a fancy
coffee without me knowing.

08:38.680 --> 08:41.240
PHONE VIBRATING
Milk and one sugar for me, please.

08:48.600 --> 08:51.600
I'm in labour, Mother,
not quadriplegic.

08:51.600 --> 08:54.440
Hi. I'm Adam, one of the doctors.

08:54.440 --> 08:57.000
I'm afraid I've got some bad news.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.640
You've spelt 'pavilion' wrong.

09:02.280 --> 09:03.840
Would you like a sweetie, dear?

09:03.840 --> 09:06.040
The doctor's not going to
give me better care

09:06.040 --> 09:09.480
because you offer him a Murray Mint.
In fairness, I might, actually.

09:13.240 --> 09:14.920
All right?

09:18.080 --> 09:20.240
You've got a little bit stuck
at six centimetres,

09:20.240 --> 09:21.840
so I suggest we wang the dose up

09:21.840 --> 09:23.960
on the drip that's helping
your contractions...

09:23.960 --> 09:25.720
Is "wang" a medical term?  Sure is.

09:25.720 --> 09:27.880
And if that doesn't work,
we'll, erm...

09:29.080 --> 09:33.760
Anna, let's put the Synto onto 84
and re-examine in four hours.

09:33.760 --> 09:35.680
It won't be me, actually.
I'll be home by then.

09:35.680 --> 09:37.640
Really?  Well, I've been here
15 hours.

09:37.640 --> 09:40.760
If I stay any longer, they'll start
charging me council tax.

09:40.760 --> 09:42.920
Right.  Don't worry, darling,

09:42.920 --> 09:45.920
I'll do it, so at least
it'll be a familiar face.

09:45.920 --> 09:47.920
Could you do the examination
instead, Doctor?

09:47.920 --> 09:51.160
It does make more sense
for Tracy to do it.

09:51.160 --> 09:53.680
Where did you train?
TRACY:  Would you like me to pop home

09:53.680 --> 09:55.200
and get my degree certificates?

09:55.200 --> 09:57.520
There's no way
you could stay, is there?

09:57.520 --> 10:00.520
Erm, I'm not sure I like
where this is going.

10:00.520 --> 10:02.120
You're not saying I can't choose who

10:02.120 --> 10:04.080
does intimate examinations on me,
are you?

10:04.080 --> 10:06.640
I'm saying you won't be choosing
based on the colour of their skin.

10:06.640 --> 10:10.840
Adam!  What?  When did anyone say
anything about skin colour?

10:10.840 --> 10:12.360
It's called patient choice.

10:12.360 --> 10:14.800
It's important to have choice,
like tonight I might...

10:14.800 --> 10:18.080
..choose to order a pizza
rather than firebomb a mosque.

10:18.080 --> 10:19.760
I think what Dr Kay meant to say...

10:19.760 --> 10:22.520
What I'm saying is, I know it's
stressful being on labour ward,

10:22.520 --> 10:24.800
but anything more like this,
and I will have to have you

10:24.800 --> 10:26.640
removed from the building.
Is that understood?

10:26.640 --> 10:30.360
OK. OK, let's crack on, shall we?

10:30.360 --> 10:32.440
PATIENT:  Wanker.

10:32.440 --> 10:34.200
That had better be a crossword
answer.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.560
No, dear, she called you a wanker.

10:41.560 --> 10:43.720
What the hell was all that about?

10:43.720 --> 10:46.400
I guess white supremacists
have babies, too.

10:46.400 --> 10:48.160
Not her. You.

10:48.160 --> 10:51.640

to defend my honour.

Hang on. I'm the registrar.

10:53.160 --> 10:54.760
Acting registrar.

I'm the most senior doctor here.
Until somebody more senior turns up.

10:57.640 --> 11:01.920
Well, I'm running this ward now, and
it's up to me...  No, I'm running

this ward, young man,

11:04.080 --> 11:06.200
of handling myself,
and the moment that I can't,

11:06.200 --> 11:07.840
I'll let somebody know,

11:07.840 --> 11:11.360

the surprise - it won't be you.

11:11.360 --> 11:14.000

that you're kicking them out.

They're all in labour,

11:21.280 --> 11:23.680
so we thought we might wait
until they had their babies.

11:23.680 --> 11:25.280
Well, get a move on.

11:25.280 --> 11:27.240

I'll find a moment.

20:16.760 --> 20:20.720
# You smashed a plate over my head
Then I set fire to our bed

20:23.200 --> 20:26.480
# You hit me once
I hit you back... #

20:26.480 --> 20:28.200
Rachel Glover?

20:28.200 --> 20:29.600
Kerry Salisbury?

20:31.240 --> 20:32.840
Caroline Morobeto?

20:36.160 --> 20:38.880
# Oh, my black eye casts no shadow

20:38.880 --> 20:41.400
# Your red eye sees no blame

20:41.400 --> 20:43.720
# Your slaps don't stick
Your kicks don't hit

20:43.720 --> 20:45.520
# So we remain the same

20:45.520 --> 20:47.720
# Blood sticks, sweat drips

20:47.720 --> 20:49.920
# Break the lock if it don't fit

20:49.920 --> 20:52.120
# A kick in the teeth
is good for some

20:52.120 --> 20:54.320
# A kiss with a fist
is better than none

20:56.200 --> 20:58.280
# Whoa

20:58.280 --> 21:01.400
# A kiss with a fist
is better than none. #

21:04.520 --> 21:08.280
So, you've recovered from earlier.

21:08.280 --> 21:10.560
Oh, yes.
Oh, God, sorry, Dr Adam.

21:10.560 --> 21:11.920
I don't know what came over me.

21:11.920 --> 21:13.840
So, remind me, how many weeks
are you?

21:13.840 --> 21:16.160
Oh, God, I hate maths.

21:16.160 --> 21:19.560
I couldn't even tell you
in months. Er...

21:19.560 --> 21:21.320
Erm, OK, let's think.

21:21.320 --> 21:24.280
So... Birthday's in June.

21:24.280 --> 21:25.400
I'll be 27...

21:27.400 --> 21:30.040
Well, it's got to be,
like, 2,000 weeks?

21:31.400 --> 21:33.080
You're 25 weeks.

21:34.440 --> 21:36.280
Oh!

21:36.280 --> 21:37.680
You mean the baby.

21:37.680 --> 21:40.200
SHE LAUGHS

21:40.200 --> 21:43.960
So, erm, what's the...problem?

21:43.960 --> 21:48.200
Well, I woke up this morning
with a headache,

21:48.200 --> 21:52.240
and my tongue is just, like,
totally covered in spots.

21:52.240 --> 21:54.040
Right. Let's have a look.

21:58.360 --> 22:00.080
OK.

22:02.720 --> 22:06.520
I'm afraid that what you have
is known as...

22:06.520 --> 22:08.320
..taste buds.

22:10.760 --> 22:13.280
Oh. SHE LAUGHS

22:16.240 --> 22:18.480
So, is there someone at home
we can call

22:18.480 --> 22:20.240
to come and collect you,

22:20.240 --> 22:22.320
or do you live here now?

22:22.320 --> 22:24.800
Oh, God, no, who'd want
to live with me?

22:26.920 --> 22:28.840
PAGER BEEPS

22:28.840 --> 22:30.360
Right.

22:35.360 --> 22:38.320
Adam, that lady you just saw,
her blood pressure's a bit high.

22:38.320 --> 22:40.960
Do you want me to send her for
some bloods?  Just send her home.

22:40.960 --> 22:44.160
No, wait. Erm, yes, do the bloods.

22:45.560 --> 22:47.120
Yep?

22:48.480 --> 22:50.160
What's the trace like?

22:52.640 --> 22:54.880
Isn't the evening registrar
here yet?

22:57.440 --> 22:59.600
OK. Fine.

22:59.600 --> 23:01.840
Right, we're doing a Caesarean
for Room 8.

23:01.840 --> 23:04.680
Dr Adam? Dr Adam,
sorry, sorry, I meant to say.

23:04.680 --> 23:07.000
My teeth have become
a bit itchy.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.480
Send her home.

23:09.560 --> 23:11.640
Don't ask to do it. I'm tired.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.240
I need to be gone ten minutes ago.

23:13.240 --> 23:14.880
Erm, so, we're all good to go.

23:14.880 --> 23:16.440
We'll have baby out in five minutes,

23:16.440 --> 23:19.960
and may I just say,
I misspoke before

23:19.960 --> 23:23.160
and I'm very sorry.
All water under the bridge.

23:23.160 --> 23:25.160
But just checking it will be you
doing this operation

23:25.160 --> 23:27.000
and nobody else.

23:28.920 --> 23:30.640
Yes.

23:30.640 --> 23:32.280
Yes, it will. Yeah.

23:37.960 --> 23:41.320
Actually, fuck it. You've got
to learn some time. You're up.

23:41.320 --> 23:43.200
Come on, you've seen one.
Y-Yeah...

23:43.200 --> 23:46.000
So you know the routine.
See one, fuck one up, teach one.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.800
Really? Thank you.

23:48.800 --> 23:51.400
Are you sure?
Not especially. Come on.

23:59.720 --> 24:01.240
Are you happy?

24:03.600 --> 24:05.160
Right, come on.

24:07.360 --> 24:09.400
This it?  Yeah. Hurry up, please,

24:09.400 --> 24:11.840
I think the anaesthetist's
retiring next week.

24:16.680 --> 24:18.480
Adam?  Mm?

24:18.480 --> 24:20.960
Stretch it. Come on.
Harder than that.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.840
Right, through the peritoneum, then.

24:24.880 --> 24:27.480
Pop your finger in. You're not
going to damage anything.

24:27.480 --> 24:29.640
OK.

24:29.640 --> 24:31.080
Oh!

24:34.600 --> 24:37.040
Adam? Adam?

24:37.040 --> 24:39.720
Er, yeah, OK, good. Great.
So, you're going to make

24:39.720 --> 24:42.280
a U-shape in the lower segment
of the uterus,

24:42.280 --> 24:44.280
and then you're going to extend
it with your fingers.

24:44.280 --> 24:45.880
What if there isn't a lower segment?

24:45.880 --> 24:48.120
You know, like if
it's before 32 weeks.

24:48.120 --> 24:50.320
Yeah, we usually save
the Q&A session for afterwards.

24:50.320 --> 24:53.000
It would just be a horrible, bloody
mess. Come on, get on with it.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.880
Is that...?  Good.

24:54.880 --> 24:56.400
Now what?

24:56.400 --> 24:58.600
I think even you can guess
what happens next. Come on.

24:58.600 --> 25:00.280
That's it.

25:00.280 --> 25:02.320
Just guide the head out.
It's coming.

25:03.840 --> 25:05.320
OK.

25:06.880 --> 25:08.280
That's it.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.720
One baby coming up...

25:12.720 --> 25:14.360
BABY CRIES

25:17.760 --> 25:20.000
No, get her off me.
I'm not having a Paki

25:20.000 --> 25:22.080
delivering my baby! Get her off me!

25:22.080 --> 25:25.560
Stop touching it! You promised
that you would do it!

25:25.560 --> 25:28.200
Excuse me, get me out of this!
Take this!

25:28.200 --> 25:29.920
What is this? Get this off me!

25:29.920 --> 25:32.240
Adolf's a good name.
Mum, will you do something?!

25:34.560 --> 25:36.000
You did really well.

25:37.280 --> 25:39.600
One Caesarean down, 8,000 to go.

25:40.800 --> 25:43.400
To be fair, they don't normally
end like that.

25:43.400 --> 25:46.720
Erm, write up the notes and
mention that I closed the skin.

25:50.200 --> 25:52.760
Oh, gosh, isn't he wonderful?

26:06.120 --> 26:07.760
Oh, for...

26:10.320 --> 26:12.400
PHONE RINGS

26:13.720 --> 26:15.200
Cancellations hotline.

26:15.200 --> 26:17.800
Press 1 for you need to stay
at work, leaving me to make

26:17.800 --> 26:21.960
small talk with 20 public-school
dickheads I barely know.

26:21.960 --> 26:25.080
That's unfair.
There's only 15 of them.

26:25.080 --> 26:26.520
And I'm just leaving now.

26:26.520 --> 26:29.800
No way!  Can you bring
a change of clothes, please?

26:29.800 --> 26:32.240
Yeah. Anything in particular?

26:32.240 --> 26:33.440
Erm, something smart-casual

26:33.440 --> 26:36.240
and not totally encrusted
with a stranger's blood?

26:36.240 --> 26:38.240
Hula skirt and feather boa
it is, then.

26:38.240 --> 26:40.120
HE CHUCKLES See you in a bit.

26:44.080 --> 26:45.960
You can't help being ill, darling.

26:45.960 --> 26:48.320
I'll just get somebody else
to pick her up.

26:48.320 --> 26:51.400
Right. Bye-bye.

26:51.400 --> 26:53.240
Er, Adam?

26:53.240 --> 26:55.200
I saw what you did to that dolphin.

26:55.200 --> 26:57.280
A gentleman never discusses
a lady's blowhole.

26:57.280 --> 26:59.600
Do you want my advice, Adam?
Erm, not really.

26:59.600 --> 27:01.240
That is exactly your problem.

27:01.240 --> 27:03.200
It was pretty funny, though, right?

27:18.520 --> 27:24.440
# Prophet six-zero-zero-nine-one

27:24.440 --> 27:27.520
# This is the flight number

27:27.520 --> 27:30.520
# Of our galactic sun

27:32.520 --> 27:37.480
# Prophet six-zero-zero-nine-one

27:38.840 --> 27:40.200
# Before we start

27:40.200 --> 27:45.160
# You should know that
you're not the only one

27:45.160 --> 27:46.600
# Who can hurt me... #

27:56.880 --> 27:58.520
ENGINE STARTS

28:05.000 --> 28:06.720
It's my second-favourite doctor!

28:06.720 --> 28:07.960
Who's number one?

28:07.960 --> 28:09.480
David Tennant. First series.

28:13.080 --> 28:15.640
How was work?
Fine, thanks. Who are they?

28:15.640 --> 28:18.000
No idea, but they're better
craic than your mates upstairs.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.320
Oh, come on.

28:19.320 --> 28:21.480
I'm sure you'll find something
in common with them.

28:21.480 --> 28:24.160
There you go. See?
Wearing the same T-shirt.

28:24.160 --> 28:26.560
Some guy called...Welly
brought them.

28:26.560 --> 28:29.160
Well, they're not
too terrible, considering.

28:32.720 --> 28:34.840
Shall we just do this? Come on.

28:36.160 --> 28:38.600
SHOUTING AND CHEERING

28:41.880 --> 28:44.600
Ah! 7:58. There you go.

28:44.600 --> 28:47.840
I knew you wouldn't let me down.

28:47.840 --> 28:51.560
No, you didn't.  Yeah, fine.
May have lost a small bet.

28:51.560 --> 28:53.960
Nightmare! This place doesn't do
Jagerbombs!

28:53.960 --> 28:55.320
Whatever will we do?

28:55.320 --> 28:58.560
Adster!  Welly. Don't do that.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.680
Where's your T-shirt?
Yeah, Adster, where's your T-shirt?

29:03.680 --> 29:05.320
Put it on.

29:07.120 --> 29:08.840
CHANTING:  Put it on.

29:08.840 --> 29:15.600
Put it on, put it on,
put it on, put it on!

29:15.600 --> 29:18.120
Yes! And as for you...

29:18.120 --> 29:20.480
..one pint of gin.

29:20.480 --> 29:21.880
No, I'm not going to drink that.

29:21.880 --> 29:24.120
Well, you will be, because it's
tradi-ti-on.  How can it be

29:24.120 --> 29:25.840
a tradition? I've never got
married before.

29:25.840 --> 29:28.480
Right, I need a drink.
Is this my stuff?

29:28.480 --> 29:30.920
So, did your mum call?
She left a voicemail.

29:30.920 --> 29:32.920
Ah. And you didn't listen.

29:32.920 --> 29:35.920
No. I'm changing my number
and moving to Venezuela.

29:37.600 --> 29:38.960
You done there?

29:38.960 --> 29:40.480
BOTH LAUGH

29:40.480 --> 29:42.320
Right, come on, what do you want?

29:42.320 --> 29:46.040
I think 12 litres of vodka Red Bull
should probably do it.

29:46.040 --> 29:48.600
Er, can I get a bottle
of Sauvignon Blanc and...

29:48.600 --> 29:50.240
PHONE BUZZES

29:50.240 --> 29:52.960
..a rum and Coke, please?
This'll be Jakesy.

29:52.960 --> 29:54.960
He's probably gone to Poland
by mistake. Hello?

29:54.960 --> 29:57.800
ON PHONE:  Kay.
Mr Lockhart! I'm just in a...

29:57.800 --> 29:59.440
CHANTING:  Pint of gin, pint of gin!

29:59.440 --> 30:01.160
..supermarket.

30:01.160 --> 30:03.440
Sorry, Mr Lockhart, how can I help?

30:03.440 --> 30:06.280
Er, listen, the locum registrar

30:06.280 --> 30:08.760
hasn't turned up
for the night shift.

30:09.840 --> 30:12.120
Erm... Who's the senior reg?

30:12.120 --> 30:15.080
Er, I don't think he'd get here
from Sydney in time.

30:16.200 --> 30:18.960
Well, do say if you've got
something more important on.

30:18.960 --> 30:21.600
Erm, no. No, no, no. Erm...

30:21.600 --> 30:23.160
No, I can do it.

30:23.160 --> 30:24.920
Will the missus understand?

30:29.080 --> 30:31.600
She'll be fine with it.
Good man. Bye!

30:31.600 --> 30:33.240
LOCKHART HANGS UP

30:38.600 --> 30:41.080
How long are you going to be?
A couple of hours?

30:41.080 --> 30:43.880
12. I'm so sorry.  And there's
no-one else who could...?

30:46.440 --> 30:48.960
I'm sorry. It's really crap for you.

30:52.440 --> 30:56.200
You don't have to stay here,
obviously.  I'll be grand.

30:56.200 --> 30:58.160
I've never had a...pint of gin
before.

31:00.320 --> 31:02.760
Just a couple more years,
then I'll be a consultant,

31:02.760 --> 31:05.160
and it'll just be me,
you and an Aston Martin.

31:05.160 --> 31:08.320
It would be nice to live
somewhere a bit more spacious.

31:08.320 --> 31:10.320
We can shower
in the glove compartment.

31:10.320 --> 31:12.200
Right, go on. You've got
some babies to deliver.

31:15.040 --> 31:17.640
You should have gone along
with my avalanche idea.

31:17.640 --> 31:20.400
OK, your first best-manly duty
is to rescue my dad.

31:20.400 --> 31:23.320
Welly's trying to get him to
drink a shoe full of sambuca.

31:23.320 --> 31:25.280
Shoe-ca! Shoe-ca!

31:27.360 --> 31:30.040
You're going to hate me.

31:30.040 --> 31:32.720
There's a...staffing emergency
at the hospital.

31:32.720 --> 31:34.400
There's no doctors on labour ward.

31:34.400 --> 31:38.360
No.  So I have to go back in.
Drink this. Then you can't go in.

31:40.080 --> 31:43.040
I can't.
OK, give me one good reason.

31:43.040 --> 31:44.480
Er...

31:44.480 --> 31:47.520
Er, because I, erm...
Because you'd rather be at work.

31:48.680 --> 31:50.400
Yeah, have a good night, mate.

31:58.400 --> 32:00.080
Fuck's sake!

32:44.480 --> 32:46.960
Do you want
the good news or the bad news?

32:46.960 --> 32:49.400
Erm, the good.  Oh, I was worried
you'd say that.

32:49.400 --> 32:51.200
It's all bad, I'm afraid.

32:51.200 --> 32:52.960
The wards are stuffed to the gills,

32:52.960 --> 32:56.600
there's no SHO, and
the midwife in charge is Tracy.

32:56.600 --> 32:58.760
Well, she was working during
the day.  The other one.

32:58.760 --> 33:01.960
"Non-Reassuring Trace."

33:01.960 --> 33:03.760
Right, I'm off home.
But call me whenever.

33:03.760 --> 33:05.640
I won't.  Good man.

33:07.520 --> 33:10.160
You're very intent on
showing me your penis today.

33:10.160 --> 33:12.200
They need to increase the credits

33:12.200 --> 33:14.440
on the scrub machine.
You can practically tell

33:14.440 --> 33:17.000
who did your circumcision.
Made a right meal of it.

33:21.480 --> 33:23.240
WOMAN:  Keep going.

33:29.400 --> 33:32.280
Hi, Trace. How can I help?
Oh, Doctor, thank God you're here.

33:32.280 --> 33:34.280
Can you see Room 11 for me?

33:34.280 --> 33:36.760
I'm desperately worried
about her.

33:36.760 --> 33:39.160
Quick as you can.

33:39.160 --> 33:40.920
WOMAN SCREAMS

33:51.440 --> 33:53.360
BABY CRIES

34:02.560 --> 34:04.520
Yeah. Yeah, it was amazing.

34:05.840 --> 34:09.160
No, I didn't take a photo!
It's someone else's baby!

34:09.160 --> 34:11.840
Yeah, I know,
Mum said the exact same thing.

34:11.840 --> 34:14.160
Actually, I'm not going to
make it home this weekend,

34:14.160 --> 34:16.920
but, erm... SHE SPEAKS HINDI

34:16.920 --> 34:20.560
Mm-hm. Yeah,
erm, I love you, too. OK. Bye.

34:20.560 --> 34:21.920
Bye.

34:21.920 --> 34:23.880
What the hell
are you still doing here?

34:23.880 --> 34:26.480
Don't you have a depressing flat
to go back to?

34:26.480 --> 34:28.760
The incident forms
are longer than you think.

34:28.760 --> 34:30.400
Just go home.

34:30.400 --> 34:32.920
I'll do yours when I do mine.

34:32.920 --> 34:35.040
This is yours.  Oh, no way!

34:35.040 --> 34:36.560
ALARM BLARES

34:36.560 --> 34:39.320
I wouldn't break a sweat.
Non-Reassuring-Tracey's on.

34:39.320 --> 34:41.160
The patient's probably farted.

34:41.160 --> 34:42.880
WOMAN SCREAMS

34:47.520 --> 34:49.320
25 weeks. First baby.

34:49.320 --> 34:52.160
Blood pressure's through the roof.

34:52.160 --> 34:55.040
SHE SCREAMS Grade one Caesarean section.

34:55.040 --> 34:56.880
Get anaesthetics round
to theatres now.

34:56.880 --> 34:59.640
Tell paeds it's a 25-weeker
with placental abruption.

34:59.640 --> 35:01.480
Severe pre-eclampsia.

35:01.480 --> 35:03.520
Turns out I probably
shouldn't have sent her home.

35:03.520 --> 35:06.560
Erika, listen. I'm very worried
about your baby.

35:06.560 --> 35:08.880
Placenta's coming away.
I need to deliver you immediately

35:08.880 --> 35:10.680
to save baby's life.

35:10.680 --> 35:13.600
It's too early!  I'm going to perform
a Caesarean section.

35:13.600 --> 35:15.960
Do you understand? SHE SCREAMS

35:18.920 --> 35:20.520
Do you want your consultant in?

35:20.520 --> 35:22.280
I've got this, thanks, Tracy.

35:23.360 --> 35:26.320
Is my sister here?  We've called her,
and she'll be here in time

35:26.320 --> 35:28.840
to say hello to your baby.
Or goodbye.

35:28.840 --> 35:32.640
Why don't you count down
from 20 for me?

35:32.640 --> 35:35.160
20, 19...18...

35:35.160 --> 35:36.760
Come on.

35:38.400 --> 35:40.680
Are you happy?  Ready when you are.

35:40.680 --> 35:43.560
Adam, have you done a 25-week
Caesarean before?  No.

35:43.560 --> 35:45.120
I've seen one.

35:57.360 --> 35:59.920
Pull. Quick. And retractor in.

36:47.360 --> 36:48.560
Adam?

36:48.560 --> 36:51.360
MAN:  Yeah, chest movement.  Adam?

36:51.360 --> 36:54.440
Adam!  Er, sorry. Swabs, please.

36:54.440 --> 36:56.280
Let's start the suction.

37:03.360 --> 37:05.240
Oh, my God.

37:07.320 --> 37:09.320
Come on. Shit.

37:09.320 --> 37:12.120
Pressures aren't great here.
What's the blood loss like?

37:12.120 --> 37:13.960
Er, it's a litre,
a litre-and-a-half.

37:13.960 --> 37:16.080
Can you bleep the on-call
haematologist?

37:16.080 --> 37:18.880
I'm going to need some more blood
products.

37:18.880 --> 37:21.600
Find out who's
the anaesthetic consultant.

37:22.800 --> 37:24.560
More swabs.

37:29.440 --> 37:31.840
I-I can't see anything.
It's too thick to stitch.

37:31.840 --> 37:34.520
So much blood. Shit, I can't...

37:34.520 --> 37:36.360
I... I can't get it under...

37:36.360 --> 37:37.800
Fuck!

37:37.800 --> 37:40.960
This is insane. I can't...
I can't see anything. Shit!

37:40.960 --> 37:42.560
Fuck!  Adam...

37:42.560 --> 37:44.240
..you can do this.

37:44.240 --> 37:45.800
I can't. I can't do this.

37:46.880 --> 37:49.440
This woman's going to die,
and it's my fault.

37:49.440 --> 37:51.320
Shall we get Mr Lockhart in?

37:55.600 --> 37:58.560
Yeah. Yeah, please.  Tracy,
will you call Mr Lockhart

37:58.560 --> 38:00.080
and ask him to come in, please?

38:00.080 --> 38:03.160
I called him before you started.
Why did you do that? I...

38:04.680 --> 38:06.160
Thank you.

38:41.360 --> 38:42.760
HE RETCHES

38:55.880 --> 38:57.480
I'm really sorry.

39:04.080 --> 39:06.080
It was really busy,

39:06.080 --> 39:08.720
and I genuinely thought
that she was crying wolf.

39:08.720 --> 39:11.800
She was crying severe
early-onset pre-eclampsia,

39:11.800 --> 39:15.520
which you'd have known if you'd done
so much as a blood test.

39:15.520 --> 39:18.120
And then, for some reason,
you attempted an operation

39:18.120 --> 39:20.160
any consultant would struggle with.

39:21.640 --> 39:24.120
Oh, you can buy Tracy a box
of chocolates, by the way,

39:24.120 --> 39:25.760
for calling me in.

39:28.960 --> 39:31.360
Can I just say...?  No!

39:33.920 --> 39:39.200
Amend your entry from when you first
saw this patient this afternoon.

39:41.040 --> 39:43.320
Write that you discussed
with me over the phone,

39:43.320 --> 39:46.400
and that I advised you
to send her home.

39:46.400 --> 39:48.320
What?

39:48.320 --> 39:50.480
No, you don't have to do that.

39:50.480 --> 39:52.560
Well, you didn't have to
come in tonight.

39:55.280 --> 39:56.800
I did.  Yeah, you did.

40:10.240 --> 40:12.720
Hi. Um...

40:12.720 --> 40:14.600
..something to keep you going.

40:47.120 --> 40:48.960
SLAM

40:59.920 --> 41:02.400
PHONE BUZZES

41:46.440 --> 41:50.280
Hi. I'm one of the obstetric,
erm, registrars.

41:51.240 --> 41:53.560
Are you lost?

41:53.560 --> 41:55.600
Erm, I'm looking for...

41:55.600 --> 41:57.640
..baby Van Hegan. The 25-weeker.

41:57.640 --> 42:00.520
Ah! Are you the one who, er...?

42:04.160 --> 42:07.200
Well, you're not going to knock
over the incubator, are you?

42:08.520 --> 42:09.880
Bed 5.

42:38.480 --> 42:40.120
I'm really sorry.

42:40.120 --> 42:44.040
I was...really tired,
and I just wanted to get home.

42:45.840 --> 42:48.480
And...this place is insane.

42:49.840 --> 42:51.640
And...

42:51.640 --> 42:53.160
..I fucked up.

42:53.160 --> 42:55.360
I mucked up.

42:55.360 --> 42:57.640
Sorry.

42:57.640 --> 42:59.400
I tried my best.

43:03.080 --> 43:06.000
WHISPERS: Just promise me
you'll have a normal head scan.

43:24.840 --> 43:26.960
Enjoy your last night of pussy.

43:56.760 --> 43:59.800
# I've been workin', baby
