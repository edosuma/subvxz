       is rentin' out cabins
   to tourists and gettin' rich.

23:23.202 --> 23:25.268
Well, that's wonderful.

23:25.270 --> 23:27.270
               I just wanted you
                 to know, sir.

23:27.272 --> 23:31.208
  Sometimes, I sure like to hear
      how you do that, major.

23:31.210 --> 23:34.211
   Uh, wait right there, sir.
I got a little surprise for you.

23:34.213 --> 23:35.579
    Okay.

 [GIGGLING]

23:37.683 --> 23:39.049
                 Oh.

23:39.051 --> 23:41.752
               Jeannie,
      that was a brilliant idea.

23:41.754 --> 23:46.056
Oh, well, if it makes you happy,
master, it makes me happy.

23:46.058 --> 23:48.258
Why do we not go fishing
there sometime?

23:48.260 --> 23:50.127
         No, no, I'd rather not.

23:50.129 --> 23:51.461
  But why?

23:51.463 --> 23:53.630
       Oh, well, frankly,
I just don't care for fish much.

23:53.632 --> 23:54.698
    Oh.
                 Look out.

23:56.836 --> 23:58.168
          Oh.

23:58.170 --> 24:00.337
        Just a little token
   of my brother's appreciation.

             [♪♪♪]

24:01.974 --> 24:05.508
        Bring it in, boys.
  Got a whole truckload outside.

24:05.510 --> 24:07.544
  Now, wait a minute,
     wait a minute.

24:07.546 --> 24:08.778
    Uh, I-I-I...

24:08.780 --> 24:11.014
      This is not exactly
      what I had in mind.

24:17.923 --> 24:19.055
[LAUGHING]

24:19.991 --> 24:21.057
            Oh.

24:28.400 --> 24:30.400
