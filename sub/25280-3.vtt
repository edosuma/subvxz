01:19.704 --> 01:20.872
Get behind me!

01:20.955 --> 01:22.332
Seal of protection.

01:28.671 --> 01:30.131
Hit it with your lightning bolt!

01:31.132 --> 01:32.342
Lightning bolt!

01:49.859 --> 01:51.986
Aaah!

01:55.198 --> 01:57.242
You call that a lightning bolt?

01:57.325 --> 02:00.203
If you're the remaining hope
for your village, they're doomed.

02:00.286 --> 02:02.247
I'm a healer, not a fighter.

02:04.624 --> 02:05.875
Soaring staff.

02:17.804 --> 02:20.265
Oh, no.
That's the song of eternal slumber.

02:20.348 --> 02:22.392
Cast protection from sleep on yourself.

02:22.475 --> 02:24.936
Song of eternal slumber, Pidge?
That's the--

02:27.188 --> 02:30.150
-How come you don't need it?
-I'm a dwarf. Come on!

02:30.233 --> 02:31.234
So sleepy.

02:33.987 --> 02:34.821
Wake up!

02:36.364 --> 02:38.783
You're going the wrong way!

03:01.014 --> 03:01.931
Huh?

03:10.273 --> 03:12.275
-Now!
-Got it.

03:26.331 --> 03:28.833
Oh, look, it's a crystal.

03:29.375 --> 03:32.670
Weird, I've never seen an ogre
drop a crystal like this.

03:34.047 --> 03:37.342
Let's take it back to the innkeeper,
find out where this ogre got it.

03:37.926 --> 03:39.510
Oh, man. Come on.

03:39.594 --> 03:41.971
That's way on the other side
of the Wiebian Swamps.

03:42.055 --> 03:46.351
You know how scary and gross those are?
Very, very scary and gross.

03:46.434 --> 03:49.729
Come on, you big baby.
Your village got turned into stone.

03:49.812 --> 03:51.314
Do you want to save them or not?

03:51.397 --> 03:54.025
I mean, they're not, like,
going anywhere.

03:55.026 --> 03:56.027
All right, fine.

03:56.110 --> 03:58.655
But I'm not fighting ghosts this time.
I'm just running.

04:00.114 --> 04:02.408
Yuck! Yuck.

04:02.492 --> 04:05.703
Ohh, so scary and gross.
What did I tell you?

04:05.787 --> 04:09.832
I cannot believe how sticky
this Wiebian Swamp goo is. It's crazy.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.253
Hey, you hungry?

04:13.336 --> 04:15.004
We don't have any money.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.130
We're gonna meet the innkeeper
and leave.

04:17.214 --> 04:18.298
Oh, man.

04:18.382 --> 04:21.511
I would not have run so hard
if I didn't think there might be food.

04:21.594 --> 04:22.428
Fine.

04:34.983 --> 04:38.403
This is not the atmosphere
I remember from last time.

04:43.574 --> 04:46.953
- Whoa, what are you doing?
- Looking for coins.

04:49.831 --> 04:51.332
Ahh...

04:54.168 --> 04:56.504
A greasy meat pile for my friend, please.

04:56.587 --> 04:58.298
One health plate coming up.

05:09.183 --> 05:12.145
Oh, it's you two again.
Did you find any clues?

05:12.228 --> 05:14.689
We found a crystal,
just like you thought we might.

05:19.819 --> 05:22.530
Just as I feared.
Those ogres are mercenaries.

05:22.613 --> 05:24.991
They'll fight for anyone
that has crystals.

05:25.074 --> 05:28.786
The only person that uses this type
is the evil wizard Dakin.

05:28.870 --> 05:31.205
Evil wizard?
That doesn't sound good.

05:31.289 --> 05:35.335
It isn't, though I admit
I should have suspected him.

05:35.418 --> 05:39.797
There aren't many wizards powerful enough
to turn a whole village to stone.

05:39.881 --> 05:41.299
So how do we save them?

05:41.382 --> 05:43.301
You'll have to defeat Dakin.

05:43.384 --> 05:45.762
He's inside Carthian's Lair...

05:45.845 --> 05:49.557
a tomb of horrors so filled
with monsters, traps, and terrors...

05:49.640 --> 05:54.062
that most heroes would be driven insane
at the mere thought of entering.

05:54.145 --> 05:57.356
Uh, maybe those villagers
like being turned into stone?

05:58.399 --> 05:59.525
Okay, all right.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.904
So where do we find this tomb of horrors?

06:03.571 --> 06:06.157
Just inside the Feldakor Mountains.

06:06.240 --> 06:08.284
The Feldakor Mountains, you say?

06:09.410 --> 06:11.913
You two think you have what it takes
to smite evil?

06:18.753 --> 06:20.088
Who are you?

06:20.671 --> 06:21.756
Me?

06:21.839 --> 06:23.674
My name is Takashi Shirogane.

06:24.258 --> 06:26.761
I'm a paladin. And you?

06:27.762 --> 06:30.765
Me? I'm Block, the sorcerer.

06:31.307 --> 06:34.560
Name's Meklavar.
Best axe-fighter in three lands.

06:34.644 --> 06:37.480
We're on our way to break the curse put
on Block's town.

06:37.563 --> 06:40.483
The villagers were turned to stone
by Dakin.

06:40.566 --> 06:42.193
What's your story?

06:43.152 --> 06:44.821
I'm on my own adventure.

06:45.863 --> 06:47.198
From a young age,

06:47.281 --> 06:51.661
I was chosen to be a paladin
because of my bright internal light.

06:52.328 --> 06:56.207
My master, D'Jahno, taught me
the seven pillars of knighthood.

06:56.791 --> 07:00.378
He forged not only my mind,
but also my body.

07:00.461 --> 07:04.173
I became a shield for good
and a weapon against evil.

07:05.341 --> 07:09.637
Before I could complete my training,
a leviathan demon attacked our monastery.

07:10.721 --> 07:14.308
It destroyed all we had,
including my master.

07:15.059 --> 07:17.395
D'Jahno's last words to me were...

07:18.062 --> 07:21.441
"You no longer need my guidance
to complete your training."

07:31.242 --> 07:35.955
"Defeating the leviathan
will teach you all there is to know."

07:39.459 --> 07:42.503
No!

07:49.093 --> 07:50.303
Where are you guys going?

07:50.386 --> 07:53.139
Sounds like you're too busy
to help with this wizard.

07:53.222 --> 07:54.682
Good luck with the leviathan.

07:55.349 --> 07:58.060
- Man, that guy was so boring.
- Wait.

08:06.819 --> 08:08.779
Wait.

08:09.489 --> 08:12.867
As a paladin,
I swore an oath to vanquish evil.

08:12.950 --> 08:15.661
I cannot deny the righteousness
of your quest.

08:15.745 --> 08:17.288
I will help you defeat the wizard,

08:17.371 --> 08:21.042
and then return to my hunt for the demon
that destroyed my master.

08:22.335 --> 08:23.711
Ooh. What's that?

08:29.675 --> 08:30.510
Oh, no!

08:37.642 --> 08:39.559
No! Shiro's dead.

08:42.980 --> 08:44.982
Shoo, shoo!

08:45.066 --> 08:47.818
-Did I really die in the game?
-Yes.

08:47.902 --> 08:50.821
But that doesn't make sense.
The mice aren't playing the game.

08:50.905 --> 08:53.032
Don't worry.
You can just make a new character.

08:53.115 --> 08:55.993
-I'm going to be a paladin again.
-Oh, come on now.

08:56.077 --> 08:57.787
Do you really want to play a paladin?

08:57.870 --> 08:59.914
You could be something
completely different:

08:59.997 --> 09:04.043
a maven, a mage, a cleric,
a klazgool, a bard.

09:04.126 --> 09:06.462
Don't know what's more fulfilling
than a paladin.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.798
You're already a paladin in real life!

09:11.175 --> 09:13.761
Is everything all right? We heard yelling.

09:13.844 --> 09:14.887
We're all good.

09:14.971 --> 09:16.264
What's going on?

09:16.347 --> 09:19.225
-We're playing Monsters and Mana.
-Monsters and huh?

09:19.308 --> 09:21.310
-It's a game.
-It's fun.

09:22.603 --> 09:25.273
I don't know. How can a game
that needs a book be fun?

09:25.356 --> 09:28.109
-You ought to read it and find out.
-Nah.

09:28.192 --> 09:30.695
I've been playing Monsters and Mana
since I was a boy.

09:30.778 --> 09:34.532
My bandmates and I, the Pirate Polychoral,
used to play it all the time.

09:34.615 --> 09:36.659
I was always the Lore Master.

09:36.742 --> 09:38.244
How do you play?

09:38.327 --> 09:41.414
Okay, so each person
creates a fantastical character.

09:41.497 --> 09:44.208
The character is represented
by a figurine on this holo-map

09:44.292 --> 09:46.043
to help them track their action.

09:46.127 --> 09:48.087
But the real fun happens in the mind.

09:48.170 --> 09:51.674
Each player gets a turn, and every turn
they say what they want to do.

09:51.757 --> 09:54.885
The Lore Master, me,
knows the difficulty of the task.

09:54.969 --> 09:59.015
The person must roll a 20-sided die to see
if they can accomplish their action.

09:59.432 --> 10:03.185
A 20-sided dice?
How big is that thing?

10:03.769 --> 10:06.606
It's normal-sized, it just has 20 sides.

10:06.689 --> 10:09.066
No. No, no, no. It's got 20 sides?

10:09.150 --> 10:11.360
It's gotta be the size
of a Yalexian pearl.

10:12.445 --> 10:13.613
Oh.

10:13.696 --> 10:15.114
Do you want to play?

10:15.197 --> 10:17.617
Don't you guys have
something better to do?

10:17.700 --> 10:20.411
Like, I don't know,
universe-defending stuff?

10:20.953 --> 10:23.831
Hunk and I ran into a snag
upgrading the Castle's shields.

10:23.914 --> 10:26.334
We're running a diagnostic,
but all we can do is wait.

10:26.417 --> 10:29.837
I'm trying to take a mental break.
We've been going really hard lately.

10:29.920 --> 10:31.297
I'll play.

10:31.380 --> 10:33.924
Lotor's busy handling
his imperial responsibilities,

10:34.008 --> 10:37.053
and I'm at an impasse
with the comet ship.

10:37.136 --> 10:38.471
Plus, it sounds fun.

10:38.888 --> 10:42.350
Yeah, I already worked out today,
so I guess I don't have anything going on.

10:42.433 --> 10:44.143
Might as well play your nerd game.

10:44.226 --> 10:47.396
Create your characters
with the interface loaded onto these.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.190
It will keep track of your stats.

10:49.273 --> 10:52.151
Now it's time to begin
the heroes' journey.

11:11.295 --> 11:12.296
Watch out!

11:22.765 --> 11:24.100
Ow.

11:25.267 --> 11:29.605
I'm the mystical archer Valayun,
searching for the rune stone of Lapham.

11:29.688 --> 11:31.607
What quest are you on?

11:31.690 --> 11:34.527
Block's town was turned to stone
by an evil wizard.

11:34.610 --> 11:37.113
We tracked him down
through his special crystals.

11:38.948 --> 11:41.617
Hey, hey-hey, hey!

11:41.700 --> 11:45.079
- Whoa! Where'd you come from?
- The name's Pike.

11:45.162 --> 11:47.456
I was going to rob you clodhoppers
of your junk,

11:47.540 --> 11:49.208
but it sounds like the bigger score

11:49.291 --> 11:51.919
is helping you jack this wizard
with the crystals.

11:52.837 --> 11:54.505
So you chose a thief, huh?

11:54.588 --> 11:56.173
I'm not a thief.

11:56.257 --> 11:59.552
I'm a ninja assassin, the silent killer.

12:00.219 --> 12:02.930
My victims never know I'm coming
'cause I don't say a word.

12:03.013 --> 12:05.933
They look around, don't see anything,
so they drop their guard,

12:06.016 --> 12:07.685
but what they don't realize...

12:07.768 --> 12:10.479
is that I'm lurking in the shadows,
silently watching.

12:16.735 --> 12:19.405
-Yeah, you're very quiet.
-But I do steal things.

12:19.488 --> 12:22.491
That's a lot of what my character does.

12:23.242 --> 12:25.077
-You're a dwarf, huh?
-Oh, yeah.

12:25.161 --> 12:27.246
I'm Meklavar, a dwarven miner

12:27.329 --> 12:30.833
whose precious family heirloom,
the Jewel of Jitan, was stolen.

12:30.916 --> 12:34.962
-I'm on a quest to retrieve it.
-Precious family heirloom.

12:35.045 --> 12:36.755
Mmm...

12:36.839 --> 12:39.216
Well, it's very fortunate
that I arrived here.

12:39.300 --> 12:42.595
I can aid you on your quest.
I'll summon a mount.

13:16.879 --> 13:18.923
Did anyone remember
to bring torches?

13:19.006 --> 13:21.842
I really think my character
would have remembered a torch.

13:21.926 --> 13:24.845
Oh, yeah? Why don't you check
your little inventory there?

13:25.554 --> 13:28.974
Oh, no torches, eh?
Then I guess you forgot to bring them.

13:30.267 --> 13:31.894
Oh, I have something!

13:46.742 --> 13:48.077
It's just a wall.

13:48.160 --> 13:51.205
But this is where
we're supposed to go, right?

13:51.789 --> 13:53.749
Maybe there's a secret here.

13:57.336 --> 13:58.671
Maybe you just have to knock.

14:06.262 --> 14:09.557
What can I say?
I'm good at puzzles and junk.

14:11.767 --> 14:12.768
Wait.

14:12.852 --> 14:15.104
There could be traps.
You have to check for them.

14:15.771 --> 14:18.857
-Why do I have to check for 'em?
-Because you're the thief.

14:18.941 --> 14:21.402
You're the only one in the group
with that skill.

14:22.278 --> 14:23.779
How do I even check for traps?

14:24.363 --> 14:28.450
You roll the 20-sided die, adding
your check for traps skill to the roll.

14:28.534 --> 14:30.661
If it's high enough,
you'll remove the trap.

14:30.744 --> 14:32.621
And what if it's too low?

14:34.248 --> 14:35.958
You activate the trap.

14:42.631 --> 14:43.799
Oh, man!

14:59.398 --> 15:00.858
Levitation!

15:05.279 --> 15:07.740
Great work there, Block. Let's keep going.

15:19.835 --> 15:21.712
Okay. What's next?

15:22.338 --> 15:23.589
Oh, mamma mia.

15:24.298 --> 15:26.258
Look at all this treasure.

15:30.012 --> 15:33.265
It's our reward
for getting past all those traps.

15:33.349 --> 15:35.017
This is more like it.

15:35.100 --> 15:38.437
We fall for traps all the time
in real life and we never get treasure.

15:38.520 --> 15:39.855
Wow!

15:39.939 --> 15:43.317
A quick draw quiver
with a magical creature-summoning arrow.

15:43.400 --> 15:46.779
Oh, sweet! Gloves of transmutation.

15:46.862 --> 15:49.573
These bad boys can transmogrify
the elemental matter

15:49.657 --> 15:51.575
of any inanimate object.

15:51.659 --> 15:54.828
Awesome! And I got an invisibility cloak.

15:54.912 --> 15:57.623
A bowl that is never empty of food.

15:57.706 --> 16:01.251
Our days of vandalizing
innkeepers' vases are over.

16:08.133 --> 16:11.178
Wow, a blazing sword.

16:11.762 --> 16:14.264
Hey, guys, check it--

16:17.059 --> 16:18.811
Ooh, he dropped a rare item.

16:21.563 --> 16:22.856
Fools!

16:24.692 --> 16:27.069
Hey, Innkeeper. What are you doing here?

16:28.988 --> 16:30.364
You dumb-dumbs.

16:30.447 --> 16:31.657
I only run the inn

16:31.740 --> 16:35.786
to trick foolish adventurers
into gathering valuable crystals for me.

16:35.869 --> 16:38.914
Thank you for bringing them directly
to my lair.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.332
Who is this guy?

16:40.416 --> 16:43.919
-So you're Dakin?
-You were behind this all along!

16:45.921 --> 16:48.132
This is where your adventure ends.

16:54.763 --> 17:00.144
I'm Shiro's twin brother, Gyro,
here to complete Shiro's quest.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.105
A paladin again?

17:03.188 --> 17:05.898
Only fools would enter my tomb of horrors.

17:05.983 --> 17:08.652
I am the most powerful wizard
in all of Aurita.

17:08.736 --> 17:10.529
Oh, yeah? We don't care.

17:10.612 --> 17:13.323
We're here to turn my village
back from stone, man.

17:13.406 --> 17:15.075
Your quest is in vain.

17:15.159 --> 17:17.453
I've already siphoned off
their life force.

17:17.536 --> 17:20.414
You would have to permanently defeat me
in order to restore it.

17:20.497 --> 17:23.584
But instead,
I will become the most powerful being

17:23.666 --> 17:25.836
in all of the planes.

17:29.840 --> 17:34.720
I'm going to evaporate you,
just like I did with your twin brother!

17:37.097 --> 17:38.182
Let's get him!

17:42.436 --> 17:45.814
Yah! Yah!

17:46.398 --> 17:47.357
Yah!

17:58.535 --> 18:00.287
Healing Arrow.

18:06.335 --> 18:08.837
I will avenge my twin.

18:15.511 --> 18:16.929
Water Spout!

18:26.772 --> 18:27.773
Embiggen!

18:40.786 --> 18:42.079
We did it!

18:42.162 --> 18:44.414
-Hooray!
-Hunk-a-lunk!

18:44.498 --> 18:46.625
-We defeated the bad guy!
-Yeah!

18:46.708 --> 18:49.920
I hope those stone villagers
have a little cold hard cash for us.

18:50.003 --> 18:52.631
Wow. This game is so amazing.

18:52.714 --> 18:55.717
It requires problem solving,
team work, creativity.

18:55.801 --> 18:59.179
All the skills you'd want to imbue
when doing team-building exercises.

18:59.263 --> 19:01.181
Stop trying to ruin our fun with learning.

19:04.560 --> 19:05.894
Uh-oh.

19:05.978 --> 19:09.231
Fools.
You did exactly as I planned.

19:09.314 --> 19:13.694
Only by being slain
by five pure of heart on this evil altar

19:13.777 --> 19:18.740
could I become the all-powerful
Coranic Dragon!

19:20.617 --> 19:22.786
We aren't powerful enough
to defeat a dragon,

19:22.870 --> 19:24.955
much less a Coranic one.

19:35.424 --> 19:37.384
Fire Healing Arrow!

19:49.688 --> 19:53.233
I'm low on mana.
I can't cast any of my big spells.

19:53.317 --> 19:55.569
I only have one summoning arrow left.

19:55.652 --> 19:58.238
Get back. I'll draw its attacks.

20:00.908 --> 20:01.950
Be gone!

20:02.993 --> 20:06.580
-Darg!
-We'll never defeat it without a plan.

20:07.831 --> 20:08.665
Secret!

20:15.005 --> 20:17.090
Hey, I cast "secret."
You can't listen to us.

20:17.883 --> 20:18.884
Got it?

20:24.389 --> 20:25.891
Secret received.

20:25.974 --> 20:27.392
Let's do this.

20:27.476 --> 20:30.229
Nanny-nanny boo-boo!
Nanny-nanny boo-boo!

20:30.312 --> 20:31.939
Come on, come and get me!

20:45.827 --> 20:46.662
Hey!

20:48.080 --> 20:48.956
Over here!

21:17.859 --> 21:20.279
So much fun!

21:20.362 --> 21:21.947
Like, too much fun.

21:22.030 --> 21:24.157
Great idea to transmute
that food into oil.

21:24.241 --> 21:27.703
Yeah, if only we could transmute
the particle barrier's polarity.

21:27.786 --> 21:31.540
Yeah. To do that you'd need
some kind of quantum shift network

21:31.623 --> 21:35.043
to simulate a collapse of the wave pocket
into a darkening perplexity.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.713
Yeah, and that would be
impossible without...

21:38.922 --> 21:41.466
Changing the Planck Constant.

21:43.552 --> 21:46.638
Somehow I understand the fantasy words
better than the science ones.

21:46.722 --> 21:49.182
I can't get over how great that game was.

21:49.266 --> 21:52.894
And my head feels so much better.
Thank you, Coran.

21:52.978 --> 21:57.232
The game isn't over yet. Wait until you
find out who Dakin was working for.

21:57.316 --> 22:00.152
Maybe you'll finally be able
to avenge your master.

22:00.235 --> 22:03.071
How can you have an adventure ready
to avenge my master?

22:03.155 --> 22:04.614
I just made that story up.

22:04.698 --> 22:07.075
I also made it all up, Shiro.

22:07.159 --> 22:10.037
That's the real magic
of Monsters and Mana.

22:10.954 --> 22:14.416
That was incredible!
It's crazy how long we've been playing.

22:14.499 --> 22:16.084
It seemed like no time at all.

22:16.168 --> 22:18.587
Yeah, we have a pretty good time together,
don't we?

22:18.670 --> 22:20.380
We sure do.

22:23.133 --> 22:26.803
Allura, I have grand news.
The ship is ready to begin testing.

22:26.887 --> 22:28.930
Fabulous. Let's try it.

22:32.100 --> 22:36.605
-So, who wants to play another round?
-Sure, count me in.

22:37.397 --> 22:38.899
I wanna be a paladin again.

22:41.860 --> 22:42.694
What?

22:43.305 --> 22:49.380
