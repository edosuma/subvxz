00:22.188 --> 00:26.317
MAY 24, 1993

00:26.401 --> 00:29.863
Dismay and grief in all of Mexico--

00:29.946 --> 00:33.158
over the murder of
Cardinal Juan Jesús Posadas Ocampo,

00:33.241 --> 00:35.410
archbishop of Guadalajara.

00:35.493 --> 00:37.746
He died during a gunfight

00:37.829 --> 00:40.373
at the international airport
of Guadalajara.

00:40.457 --> 00:41.833
Seven people are dead.

00:41.916 --> 00:44.127
These are the details from this afternoon.

00:44.210 --> 00:47.255
All of a sudden,
we all threw ourselves to the floor

00:47.338 --> 00:50.049
because of the heavy shooting.
Bullets were coming from everywhere.

00:50.133 --> 00:51.885
Were they waiting for someone?

00:51.968 --> 00:52.969
I think so.

00:54.012 --> 00:57.557
Well, everybody was there,

00:57.640 --> 01:01.352
running among all those bullets
and in the stairs.

01:01.436 --> 01:02.687
I was in the stairs.

01:02.771 --> 01:04.314
I saw some norteños

01:04.397 --> 01:07.650
wearing hats and checkered shirts
shooting the white car up.

01:07.734 --> 01:10.361
-The cardinal was inside.
-Did you kill him?

01:20.497 --> 01:24.834
I feel the warmth
from my boiling blood

01:24.918 --> 01:29.172
I feel the fear, sweat dripping away

01:29.255 --> 01:33.510
There's a stillness
that nothing transmits

01:33.593 --> 01:38.515
I'm a breeze that grows stronger

01:40.683 --> 01:44.562
Even when the clouds drift away

01:44.646 --> 01:48.608
Even when my skin dries away

01:48.691 --> 01:52.695
I'll be back someday

01:53.696 --> 01:57.742
To unleash my return

02:01.746 --> 02:06.376
I have the dust that protects the road

02:06.459 --> 02:10.755
I have the branches of a leafless tree

02:10.839 --> 02:15.176
I'm the guardian of the tired night

02:15.260 --> 02:20.932
There are silhouettes
that come to meet me

02:21.933 --> 02:26.229
Even when the clouds drift away

02:26.312 --> 02:29.566
Even when my skin dries away

02:30.400 --> 02:34.571
I'll be back someday

02:34.654 --> 02:39.534
To unleash my return

02:40.660 --> 02:42.412
THREE DAYS EARLIER

02:42.495 --> 02:45.248
Who's coming?
Hugo! The Grandfather!

02:45.331 --> 02:46.416
Goal!

02:46.499 --> 02:50.086
Goal! Goal!

02:50.169 --> 02:51.796
Goal!

02:51.880 --> 02:54.299
We're in the World Cup! Goal!

02:58.386 --> 03:00.179
-How's it going?
-We won!

03:00.263 --> 03:01.973
What? It's over already?

03:02.056 --> 03:05.393
Yes, Dad.
We really wanted to be with you.

03:05.476 --> 03:07.979
I also wanted to watch
the match with you, son,

03:08.062 --> 03:09.564
but it was impossible.

03:09.647 --> 03:12.650
Next time, I'll take you
to the stadium.

03:12.734 --> 03:15.028
Let me speak to your mother.

03:15.111 --> 03:17.155
Hugo touches the ball...

03:17.238 --> 03:19.490
-Honey, will you come?
-I can't.

03:19.574 --> 03:20.867
Things are quite messy now.

03:20.950 --> 03:23.870
Besides, this week is Graciela
and Moreno's turn.

03:24.954 --> 03:27.415
-When will all this finish?
-If it was up to me,

03:27.498 --> 03:29.167
I'd finish this up today.

03:38.426 --> 03:41.971
AMADO RANCH, GUADALAJARA

03:49.395 --> 03:51.439
Are you cutting me
out of the deal?

03:51.522 --> 03:53.233
What did you expect?

03:53.316 --> 03:56.736
The government is on my ass
for the mess you caused in Vallarta.

03:56.819 --> 03:59.614
What about our codes?
You don't care?

03:59.697 --> 04:01.366
Güero deserved to be avenged.

04:02.450 --> 04:04.744
I don't owe you an explanation.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.915
Be thankful that I'm still willing
to meet you and tell it to your face.

04:14.170 --> 04:15.922
Let me keep working.

04:19.717 --> 04:21.511
I'll hide out until you say the word.

04:21.594 --> 04:23.972
Feed that bullshit to someone else.

04:24.889 --> 04:26.516
You and the Avendaños
couldn't care less about the deal.

04:26.599 --> 04:28.101
But you're only leaving me out.

04:29.519 --> 04:33.314
I only want to keep working
in peace, Amado.

04:33.398 --> 04:36.693
If the Avendaños stay calm,
I'll be mellow.

04:36.776 --> 04:38.486
-No more problems.
-There'd better not be.

04:38.569 --> 04:41.489
The first one to shoot
will be the first one to die.

04:41.572 --> 04:44.367
And I don't give a damn
if it's you or those assholes.

04:44.450 --> 04:46.828
-So then?
-Then...

04:53.584 --> 04:54.836
Stay out for a month.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.881
Find another woman,
have more children.

04:58.965 --> 05:00.967
Stay out of the business
for one month.

05:01.843 --> 05:02.927
Deal?

05:18.234 --> 05:19.902
What happened?

05:19.986 --> 05:21.779
Did he believe you'll stay out?

05:21.863 --> 05:23.948
If not, I'd be out
of the organization already.

05:24.032 --> 05:25.325
Well, as Ismael always says,

05:25.408 --> 05:27.243
we have to keep low profile.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.495
Right now, we have to do
as Amado says.

05:29.579 --> 05:31.956
But we'll take revenge
against the Avendaños.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.833
They owe us, and with interest.

05:33.916 --> 05:35.960
Do not let your guard down
with Amado.

05:36.044 --> 05:38.921
As soon as he can,
he'll get rid of you.

05:39.005 --> 05:40.798
He knows now
you're not afraid of him.

06:10.078 --> 06:11.704
Are you staying tonight?

06:38.606 --> 06:40.525
Where are we going?

06:41.984 --> 06:43.611
It's a surprise.

07:02.505 --> 07:04.257
What are we celebrating?

07:06.425 --> 07:08.678
Fix this here, look.

07:08.761 --> 07:10.388
Well, this hotel is mine.

07:10.471 --> 07:12.306
-What?
-Really?

07:12.390 --> 07:14.142
Congratulations!

07:16.644 --> 07:18.020
What's that over there, Dad?

07:18.104 --> 07:20.857
Ask Toño to show you
the hotel, come on.

07:20.940 --> 07:23.526
-When did this happen?
-Lora!

07:25.319 --> 07:27.113
-Graciela.
-Good afternoon.

07:27.196 --> 07:30.032
Let me introduce you to Mr. Lora.
He helped me purchase this hotel.

07:30.867 --> 07:33.619
-Graciela, nice to meet you.
-The pleasure is mine, madam.

07:33.703 --> 07:34.704
You can order
whatever you want, honey.

07:34.787 --> 07:37.373
-Excuse me.
-All right. Go ahead.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.584
Everything is set

07:39.667 --> 07:41.419
to buy the banana plantations
in Guatemala, sir.

07:41.502 --> 07:44.255
Here are the documents,
if you want to have a look.

07:44.338 --> 07:46.883
We just need the signature
of the frontman.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.678
Find me more investment
opportunities here, Lora.

07:50.761 --> 07:53.014
I want to make this city mine.

08:07.695 --> 08:08.696
Boss.

08:10.490 --> 08:13.284
The Director of the Judicial Police
is waiting for you.

08:14.911 --> 08:18.873
"EL CHINO"
JUDICIAL POLICE DIRECTOR

08:21.667 --> 08:23.586
-Welcome.
-What's up.

08:26.464 --> 08:28.591
Bring me a bean stew
and some cheese.

08:28.674 --> 08:30.468
Right away, Mr. Joaquín.

08:30.551 --> 08:32.845
Seems like you're a regular, huh?

08:32.929 --> 08:34.096
I'm the owner.

08:36.557 --> 08:38.184
Why are you here?

08:38.267 --> 08:42.021
There's a good opportunity for you
to meet the Deputy Attorney General.

08:43.940 --> 08:46.067
You can meet him
on the 24th in Puerto Vallarta.

08:46.150 --> 08:47.151
No.

08:49.278 --> 08:50.780
Things are too hot right now.

08:50.863 --> 08:53.241
If he wants to meet up,
he can stay here.

08:55.451 --> 08:57.370
Listen, it's either that or nothing.

08:57.453 --> 08:59.163
He's not a flexible man.

08:59.247 --> 09:01.415
Besides, he's very interested
in meeting you.

09:04.210 --> 09:06.003
This way, please.

09:14.971 --> 09:17.348
Isn't that the cardinal
who's friends with the Avendaños?

09:18.808 --> 09:21.352
Yes, he's a close friend
of their mother.

09:21.435 --> 09:23.604
I don't know who
the other one is.

09:27.316 --> 09:29.777
How much do you want
for the introduction in Vallarta?

09:31.237 --> 09:33.614
One million
and I'll take care of everything.

09:34.657 --> 09:38.744
I'll give you first-class airfare,
and I can include a girl for you.

09:47.086 --> 09:48.671
Cheers.

09:51.632 --> 09:55.219
MAY 24, 1993

10:48.648 --> 10:51.067
GUADALAJARA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

11:02.495 --> 11:04.497
I'll get the bags.

11:21.931 --> 11:23.307
Stay alert!

11:31.273 --> 11:32.400
Boss!

11:33.275 --> 11:34.652
Get down, boss!

11:56.924 --> 11:58.134
THREE DAYS EARLIER

11:58.217 --> 12:01.053
Who's coming?
Hugo! The Grandfather!

12:01.137 --> 12:03.222
-Goal!
-Goal!

12:03.305 --> 12:05.015
The Grandfather!

12:05.099 --> 12:06.976
TIJUANA, MEXICO
INTERNATIONAL CHECK POINT USA/MEXICO

12:09.061 --> 12:11.188
IDs, please.

12:11.272 --> 12:15.067
-Hello.
-Why are you coming to Mexico?

12:15.151 --> 12:17.069
To attend a friend's funeral.

12:17.153 --> 12:18.487
Go on.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.406
Thank you.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.246
IDs.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.003
Why are you coming to Mexico?

12:34.086 --> 12:35.796
To attend a friend's funeral.

12:38.048 --> 12:39.508
Go on.

12:41.760 --> 12:44.096
He's known as El Chapo.

12:48.726 --> 12:51.228
He's well protected
in Guadalajara.

12:52.980 --> 12:55.149
It's not easy to find him.

13:01.614 --> 13:04.825
GUADALAJARA, MEXICO
WAREHOUSE

13:11.373 --> 13:13.375
That's those bastards there.

13:20.216 --> 13:22.176
What's up?

13:27.097 --> 13:28.307
How much?

13:45.491 --> 13:48.911
Every two or three days
he'll move to a different house.

13:48.994 --> 13:51.455
He officially has two homes
in Guadalajara,

13:51.539 --> 13:53.123
one for each of his wives.

13:53.207 --> 13:54.959
Separate.

14:06.011 --> 14:08.806
ALEJANDRA'S HOUSE

14:20.484 --> 14:22.903
There's no movement,
only his son is here.

14:26.532 --> 14:29.618
GRACIELA'S HOUSE

14:55.561 --> 14:58.105
We're near the house
of one of his wives...

14:59.106 --> 15:00.733
but no signs of him.

15:00.816 --> 15:03.485
There must be something
he doesn't change.

15:04.945 --> 15:06.572
Maybe a place he always goes.

15:07.698 --> 15:10.075
-Some kind of routine.
-The cars.

15:10.159 --> 15:11.952
He doesn't change that.

15:13.287 --> 15:14.830
He often drives a big old car.

15:17.666 --> 15:19.460
A white Grand Marquis.

15:21.962 --> 15:23.672
Look, look, a Marquis!

15:24.590 --> 15:26.634
There he is!
There he is. Go, go!

15:26.717 --> 15:28.886
He's driving on Fifth Avenue.

15:28.969 --> 15:30.804
He's driving south through Juárez.

15:30.888 --> 15:32.097
Follow him.

15:36.852 --> 15:40.481
Hey Cougar,
we're almost up to where you're at.

15:40.564 --> 15:43.567
I can see you. We're behind you.

15:45.611 --> 15:47.780
Spanky here, also taking off.

15:56.830 --> 16:00.918
Whoever kills him...

16:01.001 --> 16:03.295
gets paid double.

16:04.880 --> 16:06.674
I'm going to catch up to him.

16:06.757 --> 16:08.217
No, no, wait, wait.

16:08.300 --> 16:10.177
Keep your distance.

16:10.260 --> 16:12.179
There's something weird
with this guy.

16:12.262 --> 16:14.056
He has no bodyguards.

16:14.139 --> 16:16.517
Let's see where he's heading to.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.477
As you wish, Amado.

16:18.560 --> 16:20.854
Yes, we won't cause you
any trouble.

16:23.482 --> 16:26.151
Amado cut a deal with Chapo
to keep things quiet for now.

16:26.235 --> 16:27.820
We can't kill him.

16:27.903 --> 16:29.863
Well, it'll have to wait.

17:02.771 --> 17:03.814
Are you ready?

17:07.317 --> 17:10.362
It's not him! It's not him!
Floor it!

17:11.405 --> 17:12.823
Let's go!

17:15.492 --> 17:18.287
Go. We have to find Chapo?

17:18.370 --> 17:21.915
No, boss.
It wasn't Chapo's car.

17:45.939 --> 17:48.442
-What's up, Benjamín?
-Chino, come in.

17:48.525 --> 17:50.486
-Ramón.
-Chino.

17:53.197 --> 17:55.032
Well, Chino.

17:56.325 --> 17:57.618
Speak.

17:57.701 --> 18:00.662
Why the rush to speak to us?

18:00.746 --> 18:02.956
I have information that's worth gold,
gentlemen.

18:03.040 --> 18:05.334
About what and how much?

18:06.710 --> 18:10.631
Information on Chapo Guzmán.
Five million dollars.

18:13.217 --> 18:15.094
If you're asking for that much, Chino,

18:15.177 --> 18:17.137
you'll have to give us
his exact location.

18:18.180 --> 18:22.351
Well, I have the exact date,
place, and time.

18:30.859 --> 18:33.028
We'll take you the money
to the same place as always.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.988
Now, spill the beans.

18:35.072 --> 18:38.033
Chapo will be at the airport on the 24th.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.953
He's travelling to Puerto Vallarta
on the 5 p.m. flight.

18:42.913 --> 18:44.498
Why are you so sure?

18:45.332 --> 18:47.376
I bought his ticket myself.

18:50.003 --> 18:52.297
What do you get out of it?

18:52.381 --> 18:55.592
The war between you guys
is making the government nervous.

18:55.676 --> 19:00.639
So, dead dogs... don't bite.

19:02.599 --> 19:05.227
MAY 24, 1993

19:25.080 --> 19:26.915
Come on, guys!

19:26.999 --> 19:29.251
It's time to do
what we know best.

19:29.334 --> 19:31.795
We didn't come all the way
from San Diego to look like idiots.

19:31.879 --> 19:34.339
We know who our target is.

19:34.423 --> 19:36.383
Let's toast to that!

19:37.426 --> 19:39.511
-Logan Heights!
-Logan Heights!

19:39.595 --> 19:41.972
No, no, no.
I don't give a damn about that.

19:42.055 --> 19:44.516
We agreed you would
stay here, you idiot.

19:44.600 --> 19:47.227
I won't miss the chance
to kill Chapo.

19:47.311 --> 19:49.229
Ramón, Amado will kill us.

19:49.313 --> 19:51.023
Listen, things are screwed up.

19:51.106 --> 19:53.066
You cannot expose yourself!

19:53.150 --> 19:56.528
Once Chapo is dead,
Amado will thank us.

20:47.454 --> 20:48.622
Let's go.

20:51.208 --> 20:52.292
Boss!

20:54.044 --> 20:55.629
Get down, boss!

21:41.049 --> 21:44.177
Police. I'm on this flight.

21:48.640 --> 21:49.766
Excuse me.

21:52.227 --> 21:55.605
Welcome aboard,
ladies and gentlemen.

21:55.689 --> 21:57.649
We are preparing for take-off.

21:57.733 --> 22:01.320
Approximate flight time is
two hours and ten minutes.

22:01.403 --> 22:03.655
On behalf of the crew,
thank you for your preference...

22:16.168 --> 22:18.170
THREE DAYS EARLIER

22:18.253 --> 22:21.715
Who's coming?
Hugo! The Grandfather!

22:21.798 --> 22:25.010
Goal!

22:25.093 --> 22:27.763
-Who was it?
-The Grandfather Cruz.

22:27.846 --> 22:29.473
That's amazing!

22:34.227 --> 22:35.854
Before anything,

22:35.937 --> 22:39.274
I want to thank you all for coming
today despite the football match.

22:40.817 --> 22:43.445
It's nice to see Mexico
win a football match...

22:44.279 --> 22:47.824
although I would like to see it win
in so many other spheres...

22:49.076 --> 22:51.828
winning against drug trafficking,

22:51.912 --> 22:53.747
against the mafia,

22:53.830 --> 22:55.499
against corruption.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.920
Some people say
that the church's pulpit

23:00.003 --> 23:02.422
is not the place
to speak about this.

23:03.465 --> 23:06.843
But I believe that if you see evil
and choose to remain silent,

23:06.927 --> 23:11.640
you're being an accomplice of that evil
that eats away our society,

23:11.723 --> 23:15.352
the evil that enters our homes

23:15.435 --> 23:17.479
and hurts our children...

23:18.313 --> 23:21.358
the evil called drug trafficking.

23:22.567 --> 23:24.611
But drug traffickers
do not act alone.

23:25.487 --> 23:29.366
The government,
with its endless corruption...

23:30.575 --> 23:32.869
is an accomplice of this cancer
that is consuming us.

23:34.371 --> 23:36.164
Let's not remain silent,
brothers and sisters.

23:36.248 --> 23:37.624
Let's not be afraid.

23:37.707 --> 23:39.626
Let's face this evil.

23:39.709 --> 23:43.380
Let's denounce all who are corrupt,
the criminals.

23:43.463 --> 23:46.049
Let's not let them destroy us.

23:47.759 --> 23:50.178
-Good evening, sister.
-Good evening.

23:50.262 --> 23:53.390
-Well, anything else?
-Yes.

23:53.473 --> 23:56.101
Monsignor Prigione's
date of arrival is set.

23:56.184 --> 23:57.853
He arrives on the 24th.

23:57.936 --> 24:01.439
You were keeping
the most important thing to the very end.

24:01.523 --> 24:03.859
It's been years
since I last saw him.

24:08.363 --> 24:11.908
Mm! Thank you, Ramira.

24:15.662 --> 24:17.289
Any news from Chiapas?

24:21.418 --> 24:23.086
"Gold Tower Hotel

24:23.170 --> 24:25.589
Tomorrow, 8:00 p.m.
Francisco."

24:26.590 --> 24:29.467
And I just remembered

24:29.551 --> 24:34.347
the Gospel according
to Matthew where He says:

24:34.431 --> 24:37.934
"Blessed are those who are
persecuted for righteousness' sake.

24:38.768 --> 24:40.729
Blessed are you

24:40.812 --> 24:44.191
when men revile you
and persecute you.

24:44.274 --> 24:46.359
I am with you always."

24:49.696 --> 24:53.992
We have to be united,
today more than ever.

24:54.075 --> 24:58.830
For our beloved country.
For our beloved families.

25:05.545 --> 25:07.380
Good evening, Martín.

25:08.423 --> 25:10.258
Thank you.

25:21.228 --> 25:23.146
No, no, wait, wait.

25:23.230 --> 25:24.648
Keep your distance.

25:24.731 --> 25:26.441
There's something weird
with this guy.

25:26.524 --> 25:28.318
He has no bodyguards.

25:50.006 --> 25:51.424
Thank you, Martín.

25:51.508 --> 25:54.052
-Pick me up at around...
-It's not him. It's not him.

25:54.135 --> 25:56.680
Floor it! We have to find Chapo.

26:09.859 --> 26:12.779
Isn't that the cardinal
who's friends with the Avendaños?

26:12.862 --> 26:14.864
-Francisco!
-Cardinal.

26:17.325 --> 26:18.702
It's so nice to see you!

26:18.785 --> 26:19.786
Do you want some wine?

26:19.869 --> 26:20.954
Sure, thanks.

26:21.037 --> 26:23.248
Can I offer you some wine, sir?

26:23.331 --> 26:24.874
Yes, please, bring me a Merlot.

26:26.918 --> 26:30.797
The bishop in Chiapas is
so grateful to you.

26:30.880 --> 26:32.048
There's nothing to be grateful for.

26:32.132 --> 26:36.052
The priests in El Salvador
stick their necks out every day.

26:36.886 --> 26:39.973
Hey, the lamb here is delicious.

26:40.056 --> 26:43.852
Well, it's evident
that you're not a vegetarian.

26:43.935 --> 26:45.729
Bring us the lamb, please.

26:45.812 --> 26:47.814
I've heard that Monsignor Prigione
is coming?

26:47.897 --> 26:51.818
Yes. I'll pick him up
at the airport myself.

26:51.901 --> 26:53.278
Cheers.

26:53.361 --> 26:56.031
With your support to the movement

26:56.114 --> 26:58.074
and your preaching at the church,

26:58.158 --> 27:01.077
the government will soon
declare you persona non grata.

27:01.161 --> 27:05.081
That would mean
that I'm doing my job right.

27:05.165 --> 27:07.667
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

27:07.751 --> 27:09.002
MAY 24, 1993

28:08.770 --> 28:11.523
We're going for Monsignor Prigione.

28:50.937 --> 28:53.732
Ah, I hope
Prigione won't take long.

28:53.815 --> 28:55.567
Don't worry. I'll wait here.

29:00.029 --> 29:01.823
Boss!

29:57.629 --> 29:59.297
Get down, boss!

31:22.964 --> 31:24.632
Stop! Stop! Son of a bitch!

31:27.802 --> 31:29.262
Over there, over there.

31:29.345 --> 31:30.763
Stop!

31:32.473 --> 31:34.267
-Take him out!
-Get out, son of a bitch!

31:34.350 --> 31:36.936
-Come on!
-Let's go, Toño, come on!

31:40.231 --> 31:42.984
-Who the fuck did they kill?
-I don't know, boss.

31:43.067 --> 31:44.861
But that was a double set-up.

31:44.944 --> 31:47.113
I thought the norteños
were coming after you.

31:47.196 --> 31:49.616
Fucking, Toño, I'm building you an altar!

31:49.699 --> 31:51.784
You'd better build a tomb
for Chino first.

31:51.868 --> 31:53.661
He was the one
who handed you over to Ramón.

31:56.122 --> 31:59.542
Dismay and grief in all of Mexico--

31:59.626 --> 32:03.004
over the murder of Cardinal Juan Jesús
Posadas Ocampo,

32:03.087 --> 32:05.048
archbishop of Guadalajara.

32:05.131 --> 32:07.550
He died during a gunfight

32:07.634 --> 32:09.928
at the international airport
of Guadalajara.

32:10.011 --> 32:11.554
Seven people are dead.

32:11.638 --> 32:13.306
These are the details from this afternoon.

32:13.389 --> 32:16.559
All of a sudden,
we all threw ourselves to the floor

32:16.643 --> 32:19.604
because of the heavy shooting.
Bullets were coming from everywhere.

32:19.687 --> 32:21.439
Were they waiting for someone?

32:21.522 --> 32:24.567
I think so. Yes.

32:24.651 --> 32:27.236
Well, everybody was there,

32:27.320 --> 32:30.907
running among all those bullets
and in the stairs.

32:30.990 --> 32:32.408
I was in the stairs.

32:32.492 --> 32:33.910
I saw some norteños

32:33.993 --> 32:37.080
wearing hats and checkered shirts
shooting the white car up.

32:37.163 --> 32:39.207
-The cardinal was inside.
-Did you kill him?

32:40.166 --> 32:42.418
No, Chapo escaped.

32:44.879 --> 32:46.923
And what about Ramón?

32:47.006 --> 32:49.133
He escaped too.

32:49.217 --> 32:51.135
Well, damn, Chino.

32:51.219 --> 32:54.305
Am I paying you all that money
for you to just tell me this?

32:54.389 --> 32:56.265
Listen, I don't know
what went wrong.

32:56.349 --> 32:58.017
Everything was perfectly squared.

32:59.018 --> 33:00.770
What do you want to do, Amado?

33:00.853 --> 33:02.772
Wait for my orders.

33:02.855 --> 33:05.608
Somehow we have to solve
all this mess.

33:15.326 --> 33:16.828
Which one?

33:25.044 --> 33:26.587
There it is.

33:52.238 --> 33:53.823
Come on! Let's go!

34:16.095 --> 34:17.680
Thanks for the car, Commander.

34:17.764 --> 34:19.515
You're in a serious mess, Chapo.

34:19.599 --> 34:21.726
I can only hide you
for a couple of hours.

34:21.809 --> 34:23.186
Who'd they kill?

34:24.687 --> 34:28.066
Cardinal
Juan Jesús Posadas Ocampo was murdered.

34:28.149 --> 34:29.776
The strongest theory

34:29.859 --> 34:33.696
is that groups of drug traffickers
were involved in this tragedy.

34:33.780 --> 34:37.867
The President of the Republic
will appoint a special group...

34:37.950 --> 34:39.786
That's all bullshit!

34:39.869 --> 34:42.872
...to give us the latest details
from this afternoon.

34:43.915 --> 34:45.541
What did you do, Chapo?

34:47.794 --> 34:48.878
I didn't do anything.

34:48.961 --> 34:51.798
I only know that Chino
sold me out to the Avendaños.

34:52.799 --> 34:54.342
But I don't know
who killed the cardinal.

34:56.094 --> 34:58.346
Someone wanted to kill us both.

34:58.429 --> 35:00.932
Now you're really in deep shit.

35:02.016 --> 35:03.768
That's why I'm calling.

35:03.851 --> 35:06.395
I want to reach an agreement
to get out of this.

35:06.479 --> 35:08.606
Are you in your hotel?

35:10.942 --> 35:12.360
Chapo?

35:16.989 --> 35:18.825
What happened?

35:20.493 --> 35:22.203
How does he know about my hotel?

35:24.956 --> 35:26.916
Only three people knew.

35:26.999 --> 35:28.417
Graciela, Lora...

35:32.338 --> 35:33.881
and Chino.

35:41.347 --> 35:43.266
Amado was the one
that set the trap for me.

35:47.812 --> 35:49.313
Get ready, we're going out.

35:50.565 --> 35:52.567
-Where to?
-To El Salvador.

35:53.568 --> 35:55.778
I have to receive
a five-ton shipment.

35:57.530 --> 36:00.241
We can use that
until things calm down.

36:11.752 --> 36:14.172
This is a real mess, Amado.

36:14.255 --> 36:18.593
There're witnesses saying
the norteños killed the cardinal.

36:18.676 --> 36:21.637
But he is dead,
just as you wanted.

36:21.721 --> 36:23.723
It was supposed to be
a double murder,

36:23.806 --> 36:25.433
El Chapo and the cardinal,

36:25.516 --> 36:27.852
and the murderers were
supposed to be the Avendaños.

36:27.935 --> 36:31.439
That Chapo is alive
only affects my part of the plan.

36:33.983 --> 36:37.236
Let's stick
with the original plan, General.

36:38.446 --> 36:39.822
Let's tell the press

36:39.906 --> 36:42.783
that the cardinal was killed
in the crossfire.

36:42.867 --> 36:45.786
No one will believe that.

36:45.870 --> 36:49.790
There are witnesses who saw
how he was shot to death.

36:49.874 --> 36:51.876
Don't worry.

36:51.959 --> 36:54.045
What matters here
is to add to the confusion...

36:55.129 --> 36:58.049
and finding someone to blame.

36:58.132 --> 37:00.176
Who is more dangerous right now,

37:00.259 --> 37:01.969
the Avendaños or El Chapo?

37:06.933 --> 37:08.517
El Chapo.

37:10.811 --> 37:12.521
Then, let's blame Chapo.

37:12.605 --> 37:14.398
Exactly.

37:15.858 --> 37:17.318
Let's arrest him.

37:18.653 --> 37:20.988
That way we solve the problem...

37:21.822 --> 37:24.075
and we become heroes.

37:25.493 --> 37:28.663
And you can get rid of him
once and for all.

37:32.416 --> 37:33.417
Chino.

37:33.501 --> 37:36.921
get a hold of the Avendaños.

37:37.004 --> 37:39.090
Get them out of the game.

37:55.982 --> 37:57.566
Commander.

37:57.650 --> 37:59.694
Son of a bitch!
You wanted to get two bodies on us!

37:59.777 --> 38:02.154
Stop it, Ramón!
Let him go.

38:09.161 --> 38:11.289
If you want to get out
of this mess,

38:11.372 --> 38:14.041
you'll have to show me
some respect.

38:16.752 --> 38:18.045
Who killed the cardinal, Chino?

38:18.129 --> 38:19.797
That's none of your business.

38:19.880 --> 38:21.966
Now, your only problem
is how to get out of this.

38:22.049 --> 38:23.968
This is all your fault!

38:25.011 --> 38:26.595
It's you who should
get us out of this!

38:28.222 --> 38:30.558
Ten million and you're out.

38:30.641 --> 38:33.185
You're a fucking thief.

38:33.269 --> 38:36.731
And who will guarantee me
that this time is for real?

38:36.814 --> 38:37.857
Amado.

38:39.108 --> 38:41.861
He authorized me
to make you an offer.

38:43.112 --> 38:45.072
So this is all Amado's doing?

38:45.156 --> 38:47.950
Now he has a different plan,
nothing to do with you.

38:49.869 --> 38:51.871
That's the offer, gentlemen.

38:53.414 --> 38:55.374
Are you in or not?

38:59.378 --> 39:00.838
Deal.

39:02.465 --> 39:05.801
I need to carry out some searches
of some of your properties.

39:07.178 --> 39:09.430
And I need to arrest
at least two or three men.

39:09.513 --> 39:11.223
You'll have all that.

39:13.934 --> 39:15.436
Are you okay?

39:15.519 --> 39:17.521
Yes, but I'll have
to disappear for a while.

39:17.605 --> 39:18.606
How long?

39:18.689 --> 39:21.442
Until things calm down a bit.

39:23.277 --> 39:25.529
Tell that brat that I love him.

39:27.698 --> 39:30.868
Joaquín, things will not
calm down soon.

39:30.951 --> 39:33.454
Nobody is above the law.

39:33.537 --> 39:34.538
I'll call you back.

39:35.581 --> 39:39.126
He's suspected of having murdered
Cardinal Juan Jesús Posadas Ocampo.

39:39.210 --> 39:42.046
His name is Joaquín Guzmán Loera,
aka "El Chapo."

39:42.129 --> 39:44.548
Guzmán Loera has been classified
by the Mexican government

39:44.632 --> 39:47.593
as one of the most dangerous
drug traffickers in the country,

39:47.676 --> 39:49.762
and is now offering
a five-million peso reward

39:49.845 --> 39:52.306
for any information
that leads to his capture.
