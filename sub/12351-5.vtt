WEBVTT

00:01.474 --> 00:03.246
I'm just so bored with the pledges.

00:03.421 --> 00:05.754
I'm a senior.
I should be doing something more.

00:06.280 --> 00:09.382
You turned down an opportunity
to work with Dr. Larsen.

00:09.529 --> 00:11.533
I'm intrigued but it could
just mean you're stupid.

00:11.658 --> 00:13.649
I'd rather take a chance
working on my own project.

00:13.774 --> 00:16.143
- I'll sponsor you.
- Does this mean we're a team?

00:17.841 --> 00:20.795
- How's your bank account zero?
- You remember my parent problems?

00:21.022 --> 00:22.458
I gave up my trust fund.

00:22.897 --> 00:25.482
I didn't kiss Evan at the party.
I kissed Fisher.

00:25.652 --> 00:27.231
- What?
- You really screwed up.

00:27.403 --> 00:30.020
- I'm not used to giving second chances.
- And you won't regret it.

00:30.198 --> 00:31.145
I hope not.

00:35.858 --> 00:37.424
Hey, Treena!
Watch it!

00:37.599 --> 00:40.496
And are you sure about that top?

00:43.202 --> 00:44.718
Looking fierce, Ash.

00:45.950 --> 00:47.971
Sexy fierce or scary fierce?

00:48.860 --> 00:50.333
- Kind of both.
- Great!

00:50.458 --> 00:53.952
I'm meeting fisher for our first
official it's-only-coffee date

00:54.176 --> 00:56.779
since'the incident,'and I want
to look hot, but also threatening.

00:56.904 --> 00:59.149
Like, cheat on me again
and I will cut you.

01:00.637 --> 01:02.254
So, what are you doing tonight?

01:02.614 --> 01:05.447
Do you have a date? With who?
The cute guy from yoga?

01:05.712 --> 01:08.290
Relax.
Panhellenic booked a career advisor

01:08.415 --> 01:10.791
to speak to us about
our plans after graduation.

01:11.282 --> 01:12.335
Sounds fun.

01:13.261 --> 01:15.131
Fall's almost over.
Finally.

01:15.256 --> 01:18.376
We have one more semester
until graduation. The clock's ticking.

01:18.791 --> 01:21.922
And cute yoga boy's cuteness is
cancelled out by how much he sweats.

01:23.051 --> 01:24.430
- Excuse me!
- What the...?

01:24.555 --> 01:26.080
Is the entire house in here?

01:27.713 --> 01:31.666
Hey Betsy, wasn't there a pledge
mixer with pi sigma tonight?

01:31.791 --> 01:34.147
It got cancelled.
Their pledges have poison ivy.

01:34.272 --> 01:36.648
Again? Isn't that why
they cancelled last time?

01:36.773 --> 01:38.925
No, the last time
they had poison oak.

01:40.364 --> 01:42.093
Wait a minute...

01:43.407 --> 01:45.532
- What is that?
- I think it's the...

01:45.836 --> 01:47.239
We're all gonna die!

01:59.750 --> 02:01.336
- You ready?
- Ready.

02:06.885 --> 02:09.608
Hastings and I made
this in the lab today.

02:09.987 --> 02:13.418
It's a new bio-based polymer made
from renewable sources,

02:13.543 --> 02:15.197
- which means...
- Yay, Earth!

02:31.570 --> 02:33.285
Maybe you'll save
the world tomorrow.

02:37.059 --> 02:39.993
It must be nice to know what
you want to be when you grow up.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.819
What did you want to be
when you were little?

02:44.303 --> 02:45.428
A princess,

02:45.922 --> 02:47.462
then a Ballerina,

02:48.101 --> 02:49.506
and then John Elway.

02:51.073 --> 02:52.345
He's a football player.

02:52.560 --> 02:53.638
I knew that.

02:54.366 --> 02:55.631
What about now?

02:57.176 --> 02:58.581
I don't really know.

02:59.738 --> 03:03.742
So far the gotcha game has been the most
exciting thing I've done school-wise.

03:04.934 --> 03:06.751
I wish I had something, though.
I don't know.

03:06.876 --> 03:10.063
Something long-term to look forward to.

03:11.229 --> 03:13.915
It might make school feel
a little bit more worthwhile.

03:16.552 --> 03:18.776
Yeah. But we're good, right?

03:18.901 --> 03:20.318
What? Of course!

03:20.585 --> 03:23.415
We're beyond good. We're like...
Really good.

03:38.194 --> 03:39.724
Looks like a false alarm.

03:39.896 --> 03:41.124
Sprinkler malfunction.

03:41.314 --> 03:43.813
It's a pretty old setup.
Think about getting a new one.

03:44.660 --> 03:45.717
Thanks.

03:46.817 --> 03:47.825
Sorry.

03:49.910 --> 03:52.970
Hot fireman is right.
We should do that.

03:54.342 --> 03:57.130
Yeah, I did look into getting a new one.
But I figured it

03:57.255 --> 04:00.455
could wait until next year.
Hey, I'm working with a budget here.

04:00.625 --> 04:03.541
It was between a new sprinkler system,
or the new flat-screen Tv.

04:03.804 --> 04:05.480
And you chose the Tv?

04:05.605 --> 04:09.373
I didn't know it was between our safety
or dancing with the stars in high-def.

04:11.092 --> 04:13.230
Someone should really
get the pledges inside.

04:14.066 --> 04:16.757
Fine, you're still mad at me.
The pledges are making a scene,

04:17.057 --> 04:19.337
and not in a good way
like Betsy naked in the bushes.

04:19.765 --> 04:21.903
I'm fine!
I'm just a little chilly!

04:30.130 --> 04:34.066
See? They were blown off for another
mixer, so they stayed in for mud masks

04:34.191 --> 04:36.661
and a Tv series about old
people having old people sex.

04:36.911 --> 04:39.784
- Watchingprivate practice?
- With amazing clarity!

04:45.276 --> 04:48.089
Maybe I should get them inside
and have a chat with them.

04:48.215 --> 04:50.034
Yeah, I think that's a good idea.

04:50.998 --> 04:53.341
Maybe you should do that.
They're almost as embarrassing

04:53.511 --> 04:57.030
- as that girl in curlers.
- OK, fine. Keep ignoring me.

04:57.223 --> 04:59.464
But you can't ignore the fact
that our pledges suck.

05:02.505 --> 05:03.959
I am on it.

05:16.451 --> 05:18.326
I'm really excited about this project.

05:18.649 --> 05:20.838
I'd work on it 24/7 if I could,

05:21.782 --> 05:23.374
but that might upset Jordan.

05:24.011 --> 05:26.799
- She's my girlfriend.
- Hand me sample four-a.

05:35.087 --> 05:37.301
And I don't know what's going on lately,

05:37.487 --> 05:38.511
but Jordan,

05:38.681 --> 05:39.827
my girlfriend,

05:40.299 --> 05:41.642
seems a little down.

05:42.109 --> 05:44.142
I don't think she's
very excited about school.

05:45.626 --> 05:47.103
You know what she said last night?

05:47.273 --> 05:48.982
Please god, kill me now.

05:50.943 --> 05:53.193
She asked if we're good.

05:54.109 --> 05:55.376
Of course, we're good!

05:55.573 --> 05:57.238
We're great!
She knows that.

05:57.450 --> 05:58.823
But I guess I should show her.

05:59.702 --> 06:00.706
Pin her!

06:01.120 --> 06:03.363
- Sir?
- Pin her, or flag her, or whatever

06:03.488 --> 06:07.449
the hell it is you frat guys do,
and shut the hell up!

06:13.216 --> 06:15.590
Technically that would be
a lavaliere,

06:16.178 --> 06:18.466
but that's actually
a really good idea.

06:20.490 --> 06:21.596
Stop

06:21.895 --> 06:22.848
talking!

06:33.884 --> 06:36.694
Hey Chambers,
looking for a cheap massage?

06:37.119 --> 06:41.123
I know a great place right off campus,
you'll be very happy with the ending.

06:41.328 --> 06:43.065
Unfortunately,
I'm looking for a new job.

06:43.190 --> 06:46.331
I could put a word in at the massage
parlor. You have strong hands

06:46.458 --> 06:48.890
with the softness of someone who
hasn't labored a day in his life.

06:49.015 --> 06:50.535
Funny.
But you know what's not?

06:51.238 --> 06:54.403
I may not be able to pay house dues,
let alone my tuition next master.

06:54.590 --> 06:58.091
I can't get a job around campus because
word would get around that I'm broke.

06:58.383 --> 07:00.373
- You still have that car, right?
- Yeah, I know.

07:00.596 --> 07:03.237
You're gonna tell me to get rid of
the car if I'm so strapped for cash...

07:03.377 --> 07:06.458
Not a chance! That car is
your only remaining redeeming value.

07:07.919 --> 07:09.936
Here's one.
Sperm donor.

07:10.543 --> 07:13.546
Someone of your pedigree could earn
three times as much as I have...

07:13.671 --> 07:15.385
...would.
As much as I would.

07:15.648 --> 07:18.234
Know what they say, find a job you love,
it's hardly work at all.

07:18.384 --> 07:21.524
- If you're gonna be an ass about it...
- I'm sorry, i'll be serious.

07:22.366 --> 07:24.255
- Thank you.
- Here's another one...

07:24.380 --> 07:25.950
"part-time cater-waiters.

07:26.075 --> 07:28.711
Work when you want.
Perfect for students. Paid in cash."

07:31.666 --> 07:32.835
A waiter? I don't know.

07:34.505 --> 07:35.723
I hated that last job.

07:35.848 --> 07:38.475
You're not gonna get hired for
much else with a resume consisting

07:38.600 --> 07:41.426
of your last name
and having soft man-hands.

07:41.612 --> 07:43.241
What about the massage parlor?

07:44.133 --> 07:46.508
Nice. Ask for diamond,
tell her Cappie sent you.

07:47.142 --> 07:48.460
No, I meant cause you...

07:50.714 --> 07:52.468
- Yeah, you wanna give me that?
- Yeah...

07:56.532 --> 07:57.772
We never spoke.

07:59.685 --> 08:01.774
You guys are great.
The best.

08:02.652 --> 08:06.044
But it might help to put
forth a little more effort.

08:06.287 --> 08:08.975
You know, getting out,
being a little more social.

08:09.386 --> 08:13.203
Instead of staying in for mud
masks andprivate practice.

08:14.014 --> 08:15.585
Yes, Abby?

08:16.123 --> 08:18.129
We were supposed to
have a mixer with Pi Sigma.

08:18.398 --> 08:20.658
We can't dwell on the past

08:20.843 --> 08:22.843
when we have so much to look forward to.

08:22.970 --> 08:24.637
Like the lambda sig pledge calendar.

08:25.004 --> 08:27.985
Each year they organize a photo
shoot for all the pledge classes

08:28.183 --> 08:31.805
of all the sororities, assigning
each one a different month and theme,

08:32.104 --> 08:34.020
with the best picture
going on the cover...

08:34.826 --> 08:37.607
Abby? Do you have
a question about the calendar?

08:38.115 --> 08:39.991
No, but I would like to know
what happened with

08:40.116 --> 08:43.164
the Pi Sigma mixer we were supposed
to have last night.

08:43.289 --> 08:47.244
I'm not sure. I'm sure we can
get it back on the books soon.

08:47.826 --> 08:49.244
So the calendar,

08:49.636 --> 08:53.640
We always get July, the best month
of the year, for the best house.

08:54.135 --> 08:56.292
You'll all be wearing bathing suits,

08:56.417 --> 09:00.322
so, Linda, you might want
to do a little extra, waxing.

09:02.321 --> 09:03.900
Then, after the photo...

09:04.763 --> 09:06.148
Yes, Abby?

09:06.632 --> 09:08.509
Is there going to be a party?
I'm just curious

09:08.634 --> 09:10.309
because we haven't been to one in weeks,

09:10.434 --> 09:12.571
and that's the reason most
of us joined a sority.

09:12.864 --> 09:15.144
Of course there's
going to be a party.

09:15.314 --> 09:17.378
I was just getting to that.
However,

09:17.518 --> 09:21.372
that's actually not what
being in a sorority is all about...

09:21.571 --> 09:23.194
- But it's a part of it.
- Yes, but...

09:23.447 --> 09:26.822
A part we haven't been seeing.
For the record.

09:27.118 --> 09:29.159
We could always throw
another party with the KTS?

09:29.553 --> 09:30.827
And that's another thing.

09:30.997 --> 09:34.205
Shouldn't we socialize with somebody
else other than the KTS for a change?

09:35.293 --> 09:38.227
- They're kind of losers.
- Hey, my boyfriend's a KT

09:38.457 --> 09:40.535
No, actually, Abby has a point.

09:40.715 --> 09:42.380
Not about Rusty.
Not entirely.

09:42.593 --> 09:44.882
But you should be mixing
with other fraternities,

09:45.141 --> 09:48.749
and this calendar is a great way
to get to know the lambda sigs.

09:49.360 --> 09:51.847
So they won't cancel mixers
with you in the future.

09:53.518 --> 09:54.745
OK, meeting adjourned.

10:07.437 --> 10:08.906
What is it?

10:09.131 --> 10:12.577
It kind of freaks me out when you
walk in here and stare at us with

10:13.036 --> 10:16.832
- that serial killer smirk.
- I want to lavaliere jordan.

10:19.150 --> 10:21.516
What? I thought you guys
would be happy for me.

10:21.641 --> 10:24.047
I knew this day would come.
Just not so soon.

10:24.309 --> 10:26.059
Beaver, get the book.

10:33.698 --> 10:35.278
The dictionary?

10:35.403 --> 10:37.102
I don't know what lavaliere means.

10:37.449 --> 10:40.481
Ever notice that kts
don't do much lavaliering?

10:40.650 --> 10:44.083
Yeah, because I thought you guys
are a bunch of commitment-phobes.

10:44.707 --> 10:48.126
True. But it's also because of...

10:48.251 --> 10:50.238
Dramatic pause...

10:50.742 --> 10:52.117
... the curse.

10:52.417 --> 10:54.044
What curse?

10:54.169 --> 10:56.711
It started with the first
recorded kt lavaliering

10:56.836 --> 11:00.720
on october 7th, 1871 at the
university of chicago...

11:01.118 --> 11:04.462
The day before the
great chicago fire.

11:06.023 --> 11:07.632
What? Come on.

11:07.802 --> 11:10.648
In 1912, a kt brother
lavaliered his girlfriend,

11:10.773 --> 11:13.284
then took her on a
celebratory cruise...

11:13.409 --> 11:15.329
... aboard the titanic.

11:15.454 --> 11:18.559
Which left from england,
so that makes sense.

11:18.728 --> 11:21.446
The last known kt to
lavaliere was in 1986.

11:21.690 --> 11:24.860
The brother was so excited that
he went home to tell his entire family

11:25.341 --> 11:26.901
... in chernobyl.

11:27.194 --> 11:30.703
Chernobyl? Seriously?
You really expect me to buy all this?

11:30.828 --> 11:33.343
I don't really buy it, either.

11:33.468 --> 11:36.771
Careful, beaver!
We must not speak ill of the curse,

11:37.080 --> 11:39.375
or it will wreak its
vengeance upon us all.

11:39.500 --> 11:41.126
See for yourself.

11:41.251 --> 11:42.983
Chapter three is about lavaliering,

11:43.108 --> 11:46.426
with notes in the margins
from kts who have tried And failed.

11:46.551 --> 11:49.758
Along with a recipe
for a vegetarian lasagna.

11:49.951 --> 11:52.023
We need to try that when he's done.

11:58.436 --> 12:00.408
We need to talk about the pledges.

12:00.533 --> 12:03.154
I already talked to the pledges.
Why are you so worried?

12:03.279 --> 12:05.041
The guy from lambda sig is here...

12:05.166 --> 12:07.783
Good. I was wondering when
they'd come over to talk about july.

12:07.908 --> 12:10.301
Hi there, I wanted to ask you,

12:10.426 --> 12:12.780
is the fourth of july
a little overdone?

12:12.979 --> 12:15.449
Should we do a more generic
beach theme this year?

12:15.723 --> 12:18.028
Like surfing? Or mermaids?

12:18.153 --> 12:20.115
We didn't get july.

12:20.905 --> 12:23.880
- Wait?
- You're november.

12:24.005 --> 12:25.622
Be sure to be at this location

12:25.747 --> 12:27.846
for your photo session
tomorrow morning.

12:27.971 --> 12:29.514
We'll see you then.

12:29.639 --> 12:33.432
Wait! There
must be some mistake. Zbz is july.

12:33.557 --> 12:35.275
We're always july.

12:35.400 --> 12:39.230
Sexy bathing suits,
flags, sexy bathing suits.

12:39.355 --> 12:40.879
Flags.

12:41.004 --> 12:43.307
Yeah, november is just turkeys.

12:43.432 --> 12:45.354
And sweet potatoes,
and green bean casserole.

12:45.479 --> 12:48.025
How do you dress up
as sexy green bean casserole?

12:56.215 --> 12:58.374
Relax, it's not a big deal.

12:58.499 --> 13:00.284
The pledges got november,

13:00.409 --> 13:02.807
and your pledge educator seems
to think it's not a big deal.

13:02.932 --> 13:05.069
Which I also find to
be a very big deal.

13:08.268 --> 13:09.715
What's up?

13:10.772 --> 13:13.211
You didn't hear all that?
About the pledges getting november?

13:13.442 --> 13:15.315
November?
How'd that happen?

13:15.440 --> 13:17.006
Fine. Keep ignoring me.

13:17.405 --> 13:19.355
But we shouldn't just
roll over and accept this.

13:19.480 --> 13:21.238
I'm doing the best
I can with the pledges,

13:21.363 --> 13:23.572
we have to be honest. We didn't
get the pick of the litter

13:23.697 --> 13:25.827
during rush because of
frannie and the ickies.

13:26.094 --> 13:27.380
You have to try harder.

13:27.505 --> 13:29.737
Or get someone who has the
stomach to kick a little ass.

13:29.862 --> 13:32.089
That's a great plan, frannie.

13:32.419 --> 13:35.152
Can you please explain
to ashleigh that I believe

13:35.277 --> 13:37.063
I can do better if
she lets me show her.

13:37.188 --> 13:39.856
You've been trying to prove
yourself since'the incident'

13:39.981 --> 13:41.886
and you can just stop.

13:44.681 --> 13:46.682
I don't understand how you can let

13:46.851 --> 13:48.930
like the state of the
pledges go so quickly,

13:49.055 --> 13:51.343
yet hold a grudge
against me for so long.

13:52.813 --> 13:55.127
You don't understand
how I could hold a grudge?

13:55.252 --> 13:57.083
When your spring break
video came out,

13:57.208 --> 13:59.153
When you almost kicked out
by the house who stood by you?

13:59.322 --> 14:00.927
And what did you
do for me in return?

14:01.052 --> 14:02.816
You kinda stabbed me in the back.

14:02.941 --> 14:05.034
I'm sorry if I'm
more upset about that

14:05.404 --> 14:07.804
than some stupid calendar.

14:08.918 --> 14:12.083
We got november.
So what? Life goes on.

14:12.679 --> 14:14.601
I knew you could hear me.

14:19.992 --> 14:22.259
You can't hate her forever.

14:22.428 --> 14:24.307
I can until I graduate.

14:24.432 --> 14:27.701
Then, I never have to see her
or pretend I can't hear her again.

14:30.571 --> 14:33.312
So what about the pledges
and the calendar?

14:34.132 --> 14:35.972
I'll kick their asses.

14:36.619 --> 14:38.149
Gently.

14:41.957 --> 14:45.067
The part where it says name
is where you fill in your name.

14:45.192 --> 14:46.366
Yeah, I think I got it.

14:46.491 --> 14:49.703
Sorry, I assumed you'd never filled out
a job application before.

14:55.293 --> 14:57.399
OK. Just so we're clear...

14:57.898 --> 14:59.225
Dibs.

15:00.216 --> 15:01.623
I'm lana.

15:01.748 --> 15:03.328
Ron said you have a check for me?

15:07.503 --> 15:09.331
Picking up your check?

15:11.968 --> 15:14.061
And then my kids.

15:14.230 --> 15:15.561
From school.

15:15.897 --> 15:18.274
I have three of them, total brats.

15:18.584 --> 15:20.400
Are you just saying
that so I'll leave?

15:20.525 --> 15:22.094
If I said no, would you leave?

15:22.219 --> 15:24.967
No. I love kids.
I practically still am one.

15:25.092 --> 15:27.143
- Hi, I'm cappie.
- Here's your check.

15:28.199 --> 15:29.372
Thanks.

15:29.497 --> 15:30.921
Sa ya.

15:32.989 --> 15:35.122
Say hi to the kids for me, lana.

15:39.631 --> 15:42.709
What are the odds you're looking
to hire two cater-waiters?

15:48.362 --> 15:49.782
Teddies!

15:50.308 --> 15:51.807
Can we get a couple?

15:51.932 --> 15:53.532
Please, can we?

15:53.657 --> 15:56.154
You know those say
omega chi on them, right?

15:56.279 --> 15:58.314
Target practice with
heath's crossbow.

16:01.466 --> 16:04.120
Excuse me.
I'm looking for a lavaliere

16:04.245 --> 16:07.311
- with the letters kappa tau gamma.
- Kappa tau gamma?

16:07.532 --> 16:10.075
We haven't sold a
kt lavaliere in years.

16:10.416 --> 16:12.011
I don't even think we have any here.

16:12.136 --> 16:13.934
Could you check in the back please?

16:32.063 --> 16:34.831
It's the only one we have
so I hope you like it.

16:39.898 --> 16:41.354
It's good.

16:41.479 --> 16:43.399
Curse shmurse.

16:43.917 --> 16:45.693
It's perfect, I'll take it.

16:45.905 --> 16:47.148
And the teddies.

16:47.407 --> 16:49.014
And the shirt.

16:53.269 --> 16:57.187
We need to get to work on our costumes
for the lambda sig calendar.

16:57.312 --> 17:00.313
But first, there's been
a slight change of plans.

17:00.628 --> 17:02.445
We got november instead of july.

17:02.672 --> 17:05.881
It's no big deal!
And not a reflection of your worth.

17:06.050 --> 17:08.534
Not entirely. Yes, abby?

17:08.659 --> 17:10.359
I thought you said
we always get july?

17:10.484 --> 17:12.012
In the past, yes.

17:12.181 --> 17:14.279
You can just speak, abby.

17:14.404 --> 17:16.732
I'm confused. You said
july was the best month,

17:16.857 --> 17:18.884
which went to the best house.
So does that mean.

17:19.009 --> 17:20.702
You guys, it's just a calendar.

17:20.827 --> 17:22.714
But the calendar is
a representation of us.

17:22.839 --> 17:25.598
If we want to be the best, we have to
show everyone what we're made of.

17:25.723 --> 17:27.435
And that's exactly what we'll do.

17:30.027 --> 17:33.533
It's not so much the month,
but what you do with that month.

17:33.809 --> 17:37.069
Zbz made july the best,
so we'll just do that with november.

17:38.418 --> 17:40.164
Are those our costumes?

17:40.415 --> 17:42.751
From asister act
rush skit a few years ago.

17:42.920 --> 17:45.296
We're dressing up as
nuns for the calendar photo?

17:45.465 --> 17:47.629
That's what the'best
house on campus' does?

17:47.754 --> 17:50.120
Shouldn't we just skip it
rather than embarrass ourselves?

17:50.245 --> 17:53.619
No. And it's not nuns.
Black and white robes?

17:53.744 --> 17:55.210
Thanksgiving?

17:55.335 --> 17:57.408
Anyone thinking what I'm thinking?

17:57.533 --> 17:59.500
Sexy pilgrims!

18:04.909 --> 18:06.602
Can I ask you a question?

18:06.727 --> 18:09.387
And this is purely hypothetical,

18:09.512 --> 18:13.441
but what would happen if
a pledge who was unhappy

18:13.566 --> 18:16.062
with things, outside of zbz,

18:16.411 --> 18:18.979
were to take a
semester off pledging?

18:19.104 --> 18:20.997
Would she be able to come back?

18:21.289 --> 18:23.860
- Which girl? Abby?
- I can't really say.

18:25.276 --> 18:27.659
It would be terrible
to lose any of the pledges.

18:27.784 --> 18:30.799
Maybe not abby.
But the answer is yes.

18:30.968 --> 18:33.499
A pledge has to
fulfill two semesters

18:33.624 --> 18:35.362
but they don't have
to be consecutive.

18:35.487 --> 18:37.072
OK, thanks.

18:43.368 --> 18:45.189
41 to 57,

18:45.753 --> 18:47.593
42 to 58!

18:47.718 --> 18:50.181
- 59!
- What are you doing?

18:50.306 --> 18:52.651
Wing street wing-off.
Beaver's crushing it.

18:52.776 --> 18:54.816
Check the bones!
I see meat!

18:54.941 --> 18:57.238
And... Time!

18:57.363 --> 19:00.251
Beaver defends his title
as chicken wing champ!

19:02.503 --> 19:04.100
Congrats, beav.

19:04.225 --> 19:06.292
So, this book is really outdated,

19:06.462 --> 19:08.789
but it says I need to serenade her.

19:08.914 --> 19:10.880
Then, there's this whole
tied to a tree thing...

19:11.049 --> 19:12.882
What? Tied to a tree?

19:14.169 --> 19:16.033
Can you guys help me figure out

19:16.222 --> 19:19.156
- how to do this lavaliering ceremony?
- I don't know, man.

19:19.568 --> 19:21.993
- The curse kind of freaks me out.
- There's no curse.

19:22.769 --> 19:24.978
Would you be my lavaliere-bearer?

19:25.158 --> 19:27.437
- What's a lavaliere bear do?
- Bear-er.

19:27.562 --> 19:30.400
You hold the lavaliere until
i'm ready to give it to her.

19:30.620 --> 19:32.278
- In a bear costume?
- No.

19:32.403 --> 19:36.156
Just hold on to this
until I ask for it.

19:37.885 --> 19:40.996
We should burn that book.
It's nothing but trouble.

19:41.121 --> 19:44.110
What? No way, man.
This is kt history right here.

19:45.292 --> 19:47.298
Come on, your getting
wing sauce all over it.

19:47.423 --> 19:49.178
Tasty wing sauce.

19:49.504 --> 19:50.711
Give me the book, heath!

19:57.385 --> 19:59.179
Where's the lavaliere?

19:59.543 --> 20:01.264
I think it's in beaver.

20:03.413 --> 20:06.330
No! That's the only one!
Stick a finger down your throat!

20:06.455 --> 20:08.972
Dude, gross. We'll just
wait for beaver to pass it.

20:09.097 --> 20:10.566
Pass it where?

20:11.088 --> 20:12.734
Don't you see?

20:13.778 --> 20:15.177
It's the curse!

20:15.448 --> 20:17.204
Beaver's being punished for helping!

20:17.329 --> 20:19.192
I'm outta here, man.

20:38.387 --> 20:41.551
Funny, I pulled that same split
in my pledge calendar picture.

20:41.806 --> 20:44.299
- You guys totally ripped us off.
- Gosh no.

20:44.424 --> 20:45.975
We meant it as an homage.

20:46.187 --> 20:48.711
Homage my ass, that's just stealing.

20:49.439 --> 20:51.413
No, really, we were
so honored to be july

20:51.609 --> 20:54.555
after zbz had it year, after year...

20:56.754 --> 20:58.334
We know how long we've had it.

20:58.595 --> 21:00.488
Sorry about november.

21:00.613 --> 21:03.619
- Not exactly a cover month.
- Not until we do it.

21:03.997 --> 21:06.763
You're right. I'm sure
you'll be great. Good luck!

21:12.587 --> 21:14.755
Where's your costume?
And where are the others?

21:15.074 --> 21:17.174
They're not coming.

21:24.825 --> 21:26.537
Sorry, katherine.

21:26.662 --> 21:29.236
I thought I was going to
be late for panhellenic.

21:29.361 --> 21:30.845
You are late, actually.

21:30.970 --> 21:33.583
My appointment feeding the homeless
ran a few minutes over.

21:33.992 --> 21:35.189
Moving on...

21:36.284 --> 21:39.084
I was just dealing with
some unruly pledges.

21:40.049 --> 21:41.744
Because of november?

21:41.869 --> 21:44.854
- You know about that?
- I am the president of panhellenic.

21:44.979 --> 21:47.332
You should probably explain
to them why it happened.

21:47.457 --> 21:49.917
I think brutal honesty is
always the best policy.

21:50.042 --> 21:51.716
Maybe you should explain it to me?

21:51.885 --> 21:54.752
Do I really need to recount
to you zbz's last few years?

21:54.877 --> 21:57.475
There was the incident with
that undercover reporter girl,

21:57.600 --> 21:59.557
frannie being ousted
because she lied,

21:59.771 --> 22:01.658
you, losing half your
house to the I-kaps,

22:01.783 --> 22:04.407
which led to, as you pointed
out, an unruly pledge class.

22:04.532 --> 22:07.337
Zbz is constantly embroiled
in some kind of turmoil.

22:07.462 --> 22:09.336
And no one likes a
dysfunctional drama case.

22:09.461 --> 22:11.442
Zbz is slipping.

22:11.567 --> 22:14.332
Zbz is not slipping.
We just won the gotcha game.

22:14.457 --> 22:16.500
Which gave you five more
blue ribbon points,

22:16.625 --> 22:19.170
which still places your total
well-behind my house, gamma psi,

22:19.295 --> 22:22.382
and just below the tri-pis.
Your gpa is down half a point,

22:22.507 --> 22:24.785
not much philanthropy,
you were not invited to the

22:24.910 --> 22:26.486
omega chis six pack party.

22:26.611 --> 22:30.598
If I had to guess, I would
say zbz is ranked... Fourth?

22:31.011 --> 22:32.089
Fourth?

22:32.338 --> 22:33.497
- ... ish.
- Ish?

22:33.622 --> 22:36.166
It's not entirely unexpected.
It's impossible to stay on top.

22:36.291 --> 22:39.180
Gamma psi was fourth once, now
we're the top house on campus.

22:39.515 --> 22:41.131
It's just all part of the cycle.

22:42.355 --> 22:43.768
What cycle?

22:45.455 --> 22:48.648
After the meeting, go back to your
house and look at the composites.

23:00.546 --> 23:02.453
Has beav birthed the lavaliere yet?

23:02.622 --> 23:04.123
Not yet.

23:04.248 --> 23:06.285
He's been eating
a lot of fiber though.

23:10.667 --> 23:12.964
This is my tenth bowl.

23:17.790 --> 23:19.386
Pledges!

23:19.556 --> 23:21.472
I doubt we'll want
to hear this. Come on.

23:32.735 --> 23:34.631
Maybe there is a curse.

23:34.756 --> 23:37.067
Maybe I should just get
jordan some flowers.

23:37.192 --> 23:39.421
Or a card with a nice poem on it.

23:40.118 --> 23:41.830
Poem cards suck.

23:42.078 --> 23:44.161
And the point of a lavaliere
is to show you care.

23:44.431 --> 23:46.620
You should go ahead and do
it if you really want to.

23:46.999 --> 23:48.833
I can't now, anyway.

23:49.002 --> 23:51.630
The lavaliere, which the doctor
says is making its way through

23:51.755 --> 23:55.200
beaver's lower intestines,
was the last one in the store.

24:01.711 --> 24:02.763
Here.

24:07.009 --> 24:08.558
You have one?

24:09.200 --> 24:11.011
Why do you...

24:15.490 --> 24:17.235
No, cap... I can't.

24:17.523 --> 24:18.847
Sure you can.

24:19.907 --> 24:21.651
It wasn't meant for me,

24:21.947 --> 24:24.243
but maybe it was meant for you.

24:24.412 --> 24:27.936
I'll talk to the guys, tell them
to lay off the whole curse stuff.

24:28.948 --> 24:30.624
If there even is one?

24:30.797 --> 24:33.056
I became a little suspicious myself

24:33.296 --> 24:36.670
when I noticed the kt aboard the
titanic was brother dicaprio.

24:39.970 --> 24:41.551
What's with the pink bow-tie?

24:41.791 --> 24:43.493
Just feeling fancy today.

24:43.618 --> 24:45.217
Why? Look OK?

24:51.835 --> 24:53.730
What type of fish is that?

24:54.970 --> 24:57.860
That is sea bass?
Would you like to try some?

24:58.029 --> 25:00.169
What kind of sea bass?
Chilean sea bass?

25:00.294 --> 25:03.199
Japanese sea bass?
European sea bass?

25:03.857 --> 25:05.750
I don't really know.

25:05.875 --> 25:07.973
I didn't catch the accent.

25:09.329 --> 25:13.076
Why don't you do your job
and find out for me, OK, chief?

25:17.833 --> 25:20.181
How'd you get put behind the bar

25:20.468 --> 25:22.607
while I'm stuck serving
steamed asparagus

25:22.732 --> 25:26.149
and some kind of sea bass to moron
in polyester suits with half my iq?

25:26.274 --> 25:28.572
I don't know, probably
because I said on my application

25:28.697 --> 25:30.492
that I went to bartending school,

25:30.853 --> 25:32.959
then spent two summers
in jamaica mixing drinks

25:33.084 --> 25:35.105
at flanagan's cocktails and dreams.

25:36.525 --> 25:39.414
I need two screwdrivers, a
sidecar and a sparkling water.

25:39.539 --> 25:41.384
Sure thing, lana. Coming right up.

26:03.260 --> 26:04.276
Sidecars.

26:05.721 --> 26:07.388
Is there a problem?

26:07.786 --> 26:10.975
Just trying to remember
which bottle has the sidecar in it.

26:11.144 --> 26:13.644
Awesome. I'm surrounded by morons.

26:14.776 --> 26:16.355
I was just saying the same thing.

26:16.808 --> 26:18.107
Dude! Dibs!

26:19.298 --> 26:21.694
Why are you here?
Shouldn't you be on chilean sea bass?

26:22.345 --> 26:23.309
Thank you.

26:25.581 --> 26:27.370
- Sidecar.
- Move over.

26:32.562 --> 26:33.734
Gonna start over.

26:38.219 --> 26:39.289
Orange juice.

26:39.838 --> 26:41.099
Are you watching?

26:43.984 --> 26:44.734
What?

26:46.335 --> 26:48.577
I'm just... happy to be here.

26:51.485 --> 26:53.040
Fourth? Ish?

26:53.165 --> 26:56.238
She's not even here anymore
and Frannie is still screwing us over.

26:56.691 --> 26:59.315
Maybe it's because we blew off
the Omega Chis for pref?

26:59.483 --> 27:01.260
Maybe boys do define us!

27:03.209 --> 27:07.077
Have you ever noticed this before?
They jump from 1985 to 1990.

27:07.548 --> 27:08.974
Where are the late '80s?

27:13.521 --> 27:15.245
Here are the missing composites.

27:19.195 --> 27:20.622
One of the gap years.

27:25.991 --> 27:28.678
Maybe these girls were hot
back in the '80s?

27:28.846 --> 27:31.147
No, that's ugly in any decade.

27:32.015 --> 27:33.709
No wonder they're not on the walls.

27:34.088 --> 27:36.060
Had they invented acne cream yet?

27:36.228 --> 27:37.665
Or nose jobs?

27:37.979 --> 27:40.464
Are we on the brink of heading
into the gap years?

27:42.411 --> 27:46.236
What are we supposed to do about it?
If it's a cycle, then it's too late!

27:46.361 --> 27:47.722
It's like fate.

27:48.116 --> 27:49.281
So we do nothing?

27:50.041 --> 27:52.410
- Well, I mean, we are...
- Graduating.

27:56.253 --> 27:59.708
If we want to be the best, we have
to show everyone what we're made of.

27:59.833 --> 28:03.336
And we promised the pledges
that ZBZ would be awesome for them too.

28:03.505 --> 28:06.662
We can't use up all the cool years
and leave them with the sucky ones.

28:07.703 --> 28:08.759
You're right.

28:08.927 --> 28:11.126
As seniors
we have to fight this cycle

28:11.251 --> 28:13.180
for the future generations of ZBZ.

28:17.797 --> 28:20.525
Hi, I'd like to make
a reservation, please.

28:22.134 --> 28:23.217
19:30.

28:24.266 --> 28:25.487
Cartwright.

28:27.711 --> 28:29.297
It's a special occasion.

28:31.507 --> 28:32.603
OK, thanks.

28:35.784 --> 28:37.600
Just a minute. Be right there.

28:40.561 --> 28:41.949
Hey, Jordan.

28:43.332 --> 28:45.129
OK, I have some news.

28:46.369 --> 28:48.138
I think it's good but

28:48.263 --> 28:50.061
I wanted to tell you in person.

28:51.919 --> 28:54.743
- I've been acting kinda weird lately.
- I hadn't noticed.

28:55.349 --> 28:57.641
I've just been feeling
kinda unfulfilled?

28:58.163 --> 29:00.686
Just seeing how excited you are
with school.

29:02.456 --> 29:05.066
I don't have that.
But then it hit me.

29:05.641 --> 29:06.435
Rome.

29:07.419 --> 29:10.957
I was thinking of how much
I love the art and I love the history.

29:11.585 --> 29:13.280
And it's like... Yeah.

29:13.697 --> 29:15.367
That is where I need to go.

29:15.535 --> 29:16.911
- To rome.
- Yes!

29:17.188 --> 29:19.207
So I went
to the study abroad office,

29:19.332 --> 29:22.315
and I begged
for a late application and...

29:22.650 --> 29:25.529
They put me on the wait-list.
Isn't that awesome?

29:26.017 --> 29:27.229
Wait. What?

29:28.434 --> 29:29.173
Rome?

29:29.341 --> 29:31.050
I thought you'd be excited for me.

29:31.218 --> 29:33.719
- Excited for you to leave?
- It's just one semester.

29:33.888 --> 29:35.679
And I haven't even gotten in, yet.

29:37.120 --> 29:38.090
Yeah. Right.

29:38.772 --> 29:40.810
Never mind. I'm happy for you.

29:53.782 --> 29:55.126
Well, I hate working.

29:55.663 --> 29:56.610
Well, duh.

29:57.450 --> 29:59.218
That's why it's called "Work".
It sucks.

29:59.343 --> 30:01.825
Unless you're
a race car driver or...

30:01.950 --> 30:03.373
A pool hall hustler or...

30:03.541 --> 30:04.645
A fighter pilot,

30:05.070 --> 30:05.889
or...

30:07.487 --> 30:10.070
Who am I kidding?
I'd still rather be playing video games.

30:12.648 --> 30:13.707
I feel trapped.

30:14.320 --> 30:15.959
Just like I did with my trust fund.

30:16.084 --> 30:17.121
Only now I'm...

30:17.409 --> 30:18.605
... trapped and broke.

30:19.417 --> 30:22.475
I don't know if I can do this, man.
I may not have the fight in me.

30:22.643 --> 30:25.270
I almost punched a guy in there
because he asked for more gravy.

30:25.536 --> 30:27.347
That sounds like
a worthy fight to me.

30:30.081 --> 30:31.268
I'm just afraid

30:31.702 --> 30:33.088
that I'm gonna end up

30:33.213 --> 30:35.435
begging my parents
for my trust fund back and

30:35.560 --> 30:37.198
I really don't want to be that guy.

30:37.366 --> 30:38.962
You know, my father always says,

30:39.790 --> 30:41.838
"Anything worth having
is worth fighting for".

30:42.580 --> 30:44.771
My father's a pacifist
but that's not the point.

30:44.896 --> 30:48.585
The point is, you need to figure out
what it is you want and fight for it.

30:48.868 --> 30:49.907
Work for it.

30:50.132 --> 30:52.086
Kind of like
how I'm working my ass off in there

30:52.211 --> 30:54.509
to get Lana's phone number,
and she is not making it easy.

30:55.278 --> 30:57.367
- But I'm still fighting.
- Right.

31:02.498 --> 31:04.726
- We should probably head back inside.
- Yeah.

31:04.894 --> 31:06.874
How will anyone ever get
their steamed asparagus

31:06.999 --> 31:08.629
if I'm not there to dish it out?

31:11.031 --> 31:14.077
- Why does asparagus smell so bad?
- I don't think it smells that bad.

31:14.475 --> 31:16.670
Well, not now but later
when you're done with it.

31:17.698 --> 31:20.700
Thank you all for coming.
I'm sure you've heard by now that

31:20.868 --> 31:22.744
the pledges missed the photo shoot.

31:23.282 --> 31:25.163
Because we didn't want
to embarrass ourselves.

31:25.331 --> 31:28.583
But we're not here to place blame,
or to come down on you for it.

31:28.751 --> 31:30.325
We've recently learned

31:31.206 --> 31:33.379
that ZBZ has been slipping
in the ranks.

31:33.547 --> 31:34.544
Slipping?

31:34.945 --> 31:35.632
How?

31:38.844 --> 31:40.261
We might be fourth.

31:41.710 --> 31:42.388
Ish.

31:44.011 --> 31:46.701
Hell to the no!
I am not in a number four house!

31:46.826 --> 31:48.874
It's the pledges' fault
for skipping the photo shoot!

31:48.999 --> 31:50.920
It's Casey's fault
for not leading the pledges!

31:51.045 --> 31:52.732
It's Ashleigh's fault as president!

31:56.474 --> 31:57.740
Ladies, ladies.

31:57.989 --> 31:59.268
It's nobody's fault,

31:59.393 --> 32:00.998
it's all part of the cycle.

32:01.409 --> 32:04.925
Apparently a house goes
through good and bad years, and...

32:05.050 --> 32:06.828
Well, we've been complacent.

32:06.953 --> 32:09.766
So used to being on top
that we didn't see the signs.

32:10.126 --> 32:12.377
But we're not about to lie back
and let our beloved ZBZ

32:12.546 --> 32:15.505
fall down the social ladder.
We are gonna fight this.

32:15.673 --> 32:18.591
We're gonna start by getting the pledges
on the cover of that damn calendar.

32:24.445 --> 32:27.350
- Does this mean you're getting us july?
- It's too late for that, so

32:27.518 --> 32:29.602
we'll just have to kick ass
with november.

32:35.277 --> 32:37.142
Hand me that tray of samples.

32:40.101 --> 32:42.853
I took your advice,
I was going to lavaliere Jordan.

32:43.341 --> 32:46.462
But then she told me she's thinking
of studying abroad next semester.

32:47.074 --> 32:49.674
You think that's kinda weird
she didn't tell me earlier?

32:49.969 --> 32:52.466
What are we, girlfriends here?
Are you gonna start braiding my hair,

32:52.591 --> 32:55.628
or doing my nails while we dish
on each other's relationships?

32:55.969 --> 32:57.581
- Do you want me to?
- No!

32:57.965 --> 33:00.925
Let's make this clear. I'm not
interested in your personal life.

33:01.093 --> 33:04.406
You told me to lavaliere her, I thought
you'd want to know what happened.

33:05.177 --> 33:08.259
Yes, please. I'm dying to hear.
It's all I've been thinking about.

33:08.531 --> 33:11.258
Between my wife's snoring,
and an enlarged prostate

33:11.383 --> 33:13.812
that forces me to get up
and urinate a dozen times,

33:13.937 --> 33:16.412
plus pondering the trials
and tribulations of your love life,

33:16.537 --> 33:18.670
- I could hardly sleep last night.
- Me either!

33:18.795 --> 33:20.541
Should I still try and lavaliere her

33:20.666 --> 33:23.011
even though she could be gone
next semester?

33:24.291 --> 33:27.327
Personally, I wish you'd just break up
with her so we can get to work.

33:27.701 --> 33:29.884
But you'll come in sobbing
like a soiled baby.

33:30.009 --> 33:33.077
So yes, I think you should do it,
then never mention it ever again.

33:33.501 --> 33:35.793
What if she says no
because she's leaving?

33:37.379 --> 33:39.166
You're a scientist, Cartwright.

33:39.291 --> 33:41.976
Variables are the only constants
in the world.

33:43.524 --> 33:46.124
Wait, are you talking
about the experiment or my girlfriend?

33:57.307 --> 33:59.839
You think we'll really get the cover
with that tiny camera?

33:59.964 --> 34:02.430
I asked everyone,
it's the best one I could find.

34:02.555 --> 34:05.490
- With a lot of mega-pixels or whatever.
- Thanks for doing this,

34:05.658 --> 34:07.408
and sorry we bailed on you before.

34:07.576 --> 34:10.370
- It was kind of my idea.
- I figured it was.

34:10.538 --> 34:12.792
But it's OK, Abby.
We're glad you're here now.

34:15.319 --> 34:17.443
Hey, I heard we need a camera.

34:18.030 --> 34:19.456
It was a graduation present.

34:20.128 --> 34:21.596
That's a fancy camera.

34:22.117 --> 34:23.505
Lots of mega-pixels?

34:23.995 --> 34:26.440
It's a 12.3 mp digital slr.

34:26.853 --> 34:29.097
It can shoot up
to 4.5 frames a second.

34:29.952 --> 34:31.099
And the mega-pixels?

34:31.813 --> 34:32.683
Never mind.

34:34.482 --> 34:35.900
Thanks for bringing it.

34:36.920 --> 34:38.330
Great, let's do this.

34:40.418 --> 34:41.859
All right! OK, everyone!

34:42.027 --> 34:44.195
Now, everyone look like
you're having fun!

34:46.400 --> 34:48.092
Come on! Have fun!

34:50.369 --> 34:51.417
Come on! Fun!

34:52.955 --> 34:53.973
Maybe...

34:54.784 --> 34:57.166
Do something. Actually do something.

34:57.717 --> 34:58.793
All right, smile.

35:01.038 --> 35:02.296
Do you want me to help?

35:02.695 --> 35:05.126
Please. I don't know
what else to tell them.

35:06.686 --> 35:08.010
Pair up everybody.

35:08.178 --> 35:09.446
Photography is hard.

35:11.914 --> 35:15.624
I guess, if we don't get the cover,
we got some good publicity out of it.

35:24.089 --> 35:24.819
Boys.

35:26.314 --> 35:29.684
Look, they're all paired up. So now,
it has a nice cultural message, too.

35:46.789 --> 35:47.767
What's up?

35:55.972 --> 35:57.961
Don't worry, spitter. Don't worry.

35:58.520 --> 35:59.450
What are...

35:59.575 --> 36:02.288
According to the book,
this is KT tradition.

36:02.764 --> 36:06.680
Cappie told us you lavaliered Jordan.
Curse or not, we're there for a brother.

36:08.656 --> 36:09.405
Sorry.

36:21.446 --> 36:23.668
Hey, Lana, we were thinking
about grabbing a drink

36:23.836 --> 36:27.214
- after this, if you'd like to join us.
- I'm having a drink right now

36:29.122 --> 36:31.283
Cool. That's awesome. But

36:31.408 --> 36:34.971
I was thinking we could sit and talk,
get to know each other outside of work.

36:35.139 --> 36:37.766
Have a little team building seminar
of our own, if you will.

36:38.664 --> 36:39.601
I won't.

36:42.183 --> 36:44.356
Tips come out to $46 each.

36:44.637 --> 36:46.066
$46? That's it?

36:46.234 --> 36:48.282
On top of the $100 flat fee
you're making.

36:48.407 --> 36:51.388
That's $30 an hour
for doing the work of a monkey.

36:51.513 --> 36:53.615
And you didn't have your ass
grabbed everytime.

36:53.783 --> 36:54.991
That's what you think.

36:56.628 --> 36:58.912
- I'll see you guys next time.
- Actually...

36:59.080 --> 37:00.956
I'm afraid it was
a one-night stand for me.

37:02.208 --> 37:03.499
Yep, I just quit.

37:03.668 --> 37:05.502
I leave for Top Gun school tomorrow.

37:05.915 --> 37:08.361
Just needed to make enough cash
to repair my F-16.

37:08.756 --> 37:11.883
- And $46 covers it?
- Turn signal was out.

37:12.432 --> 37:16.304
OK. I've been cute and charming all day,
and you've given me zero hope,

37:16.472 --> 37:19.683
but I'm still fighting. What's it take
for a guy to get your number?

37:20.531 --> 37:22.592
Funny thing is, Maverick,

37:22.928 --> 37:25.021
all you really needed
was the staff phone sheet.

37:26.983 --> 37:28.160
Too bad you quit.

37:28.693 --> 37:30.100
I'll see you guys later.

37:36.333 --> 37:37.504
It'll cost you.

37:48.363 --> 37:49.504
Oh, my God. Rusty.

37:50.703 --> 37:51.914
What happened?

37:52.270 --> 37:53.833
And they know I have asthma!

37:53.958 --> 37:55.741
Did the Omega Chis do this to you?

37:55.866 --> 37:56.898
It was the KTs.

37:58.599 --> 38:01.725
- Who did that to you?
- It was this dumb calendar thing.

38:01.893 --> 38:03.560
Your own brothers? Why?

38:03.728 --> 38:05.549
Apparently it's KT tradition

38:05.992 --> 38:07.949
to tie a brother to a tree

38:08.733 --> 38:09.768
or a pillar

38:10.258 --> 38:11.364
when he...

38:13.101 --> 38:15.363
After he lavalieres his girlfriend.

38:15.531 --> 38:17.486
They thought you lavaliered me?

38:18.409 --> 38:19.785
Because I was going to.

38:21.070 --> 38:22.363
At dinner tonight.

38:22.747 --> 38:23.942
But you didn't...

38:24.887 --> 38:27.221
Because of the whole
study abroad thing.

38:27.668 --> 38:30.524
After you said all that,
I was afraid you might turn me down.

38:30.649 --> 38:33.966
Rusty, the fact that I'm thinking
of spending a semester abroad

38:34.322 --> 38:36.718
has nothing to do
with my feelings for you.

38:42.766 --> 38:43.600
Then...

38:46.020 --> 38:47.892
Jordan, will you wear my lavaliere?

38:48.597 --> 38:49.735
I would love to.

38:51.290 --> 38:52.692
It's in my right pocket,

38:52.860 --> 38:54.213
you have to grab it.

38:56.531 --> 38:57.851
Just reach in there.

39:00.393 --> 39:02.827
That's not it!
Just kidding. That's it.

39:08.665 --> 39:10.477
Oh, my gosh. It's beautiful.

39:10.752 --> 39:11.855
Thank you.

39:20.794 --> 39:22.679
OK, can you cut me down now, please?

39:32.706 --> 39:34.786
Hey, boys.
Sorry we missed the shoot,

39:34.911 --> 39:37.180
but I think we might have
your new cover.

39:39.665 --> 39:41.669
It's hot and has a message.

39:45.804 --> 39:46.913
It's really good.

39:47.957 --> 39:50.448
- Too bad it's already being made.
- You lie!

39:51.252 --> 39:54.048
We have to turn it around pretty fast
in time for the party tonight.

39:54.471 --> 39:57.385
They're being printed as we speak.
You mind if we keep this, though?

39:58.050 --> 40:01.344
- You're right, it's pretty hot.
- Then who did the picture for november?

40:04.538 --> 40:05.520
There it is.

40:11.844 --> 40:14.524
Sorry, we thought it'd be funny.

40:14.692 --> 40:16.958
But now it just seems...

40:17.972 --> 40:19.384
No, it's still pretty funny.

40:25.817 --> 40:28.525
I just got an e-mail
from the study abroad program.

40:29.340 --> 40:30.248
You open it.

40:31.734 --> 40:32.709
You open it.

40:33.157 --> 40:34.320
No, you open it.

40:34.629 --> 40:36.234
Fine. Forward it to me.

40:42.637 --> 40:43.887
I can't open it.

40:44.055 --> 40:46.959
- But you said you would.
- I know, but I can't now.

40:47.888 --> 40:48.930
OK, fine,

40:49.489 --> 40:50.712
I'll open it.

40:52.928 --> 40:55.194
There's an attachment,
and I don't have the program.

40:55.942 --> 40:57.678
Fine! I'll just do it.

41:01.970 --> 41:03.709
Wait, I don't know what that means.

41:03.834 --> 41:06.118
You look sad, but...

41:06.243 --> 41:08.495
It could be because I'm leaving.

41:08.663 --> 41:10.023
You didn't get in.

41:10.974 --> 41:12.393
The program's full.

41:15.232 --> 41:17.918
It was probably
a stupid idea, anyway.

41:20.270 --> 41:21.508
Get this out of here.

41:33.597 --> 41:36.075
OK, seriously.
Where are our pledges?

41:36.468 --> 41:38.733
If they're at home watching
Private Practice, I'll kill 'em.

41:38.901 --> 41:41.029
They must be upset
about not making the calendar.

41:41.857 --> 41:42.922
We're done for.

41:59.324 --> 42:01.005
I thought a lot about what you said,

42:01.999 --> 42:03.132
and you're right.

42:03.300 --> 42:06.253
It was terrible what I did,
and I can't apologize enough.

42:08.201 --> 42:09.806
But I'm hoping you'll forgive me.

42:18.208 --> 42:20.279
You were right,
we did need to do something,

42:21.068 --> 42:23.939
and despite our severe senioritis,

42:24.064 --> 42:26.030
we can't leave the house
in bad shape for you.

42:27.908 --> 42:31.784
If you'll excuse me, I have to go close
out my tab and meet up with Fisher.

42:34.498 --> 42:37.166
She's back with Fisher
and I'm still in the dog house?

42:39.136 --> 42:40.476
That's so not fair.

42:44.050 --> 42:46.593
I'm so happy you guys made it!

42:46.761 --> 42:48.058
And in costume!

42:48.651 --> 42:50.961
We figured we'd show them
what the calendar is missing.

42:51.086 --> 42:52.098
Look, Abby,

42:52.266 --> 42:54.782
I know I've been a little
disconnected lately

42:54.907 --> 42:56.518
and I promise to do better.

42:56.643 --> 42:59.272
But I'm glad you've been
a pain in the ass about it.

42:59.440 --> 43:01.816
- I'm a pain in your ass?
- In a good way.

43:01.984 --> 43:04.027
If I were in your shoes,
I would be, too.

43:11.534 --> 43:13.703
We may be november,

43:13.871 --> 43:17.040
but I'm glad to see
we're still july in spirit.

43:17.208 --> 43:19.626
I know, right? Screw the cycle.

43:20.878 --> 43:22.086
We're ZBZ, damn it.
