WEBVTT

00:03.234 --> 00:05.076
(Meredith) I HAD THIS BADASS
PROFESSOR IN MED SCHOOL.

00:05.076 --> 00:07.438
SHE SEEMED INVINCIBLE.

00:07.438 --> 00:11.212
THEN ONE DAY, SHE NEEDED
HER GALLBLADDER OUT.

00:11.212 --> 00:13.244
AND THE SURGERY KILLED HER.

00:13.244 --> 00:15.516
(thunder rumbling)

00:15.516 --> 00:17.518
HER PLATELETS
STOPPED CLOTTING.

00:17.518 --> 00:20.291
SHE BLED OUT ON THE TABLE.

00:20.291 --> 00:23.154
EVERYTHING THAT COULD'VE
GONE WRONG...

00:23.154 --> 00:24.755
DID GO WRONG.

00:24.755 --> 00:27.498
SURGEONS HAVE A NAME
FOR IT.

00:27.498 --> 00:29.560
(rumbling continues)

00:29.560 --> 00:32.303
WE CALL IT A PERFECT STORM.

00:32.303 --> 00:33.764
(rumbling continues)

00:33.764 --> 00:35.636
FUNNY.

00:35.636 --> 00:38.469
NEVER THOUGHT
IT WOULD HAPPEN TO ME.

00:38.469 --> 00:40.311
(thunderclap)

00:40.311 --> 00:43.314
ETHAN, SO THEY'RE MOVING YOU
AND YOUR DAD

00:43.314 --> 00:44.775
TO A SAFER HOSPITAL FOR NOW,
OKAY, BUDDY?

00:44.775 --> 00:46.447
CAN'T YOU COME, TOO?

00:46.447 --> 00:48.349
(elevator bell dings)

00:48.349 --> 00:50.351
THEY NEED ME HERE. OKAY?

00:50.351 --> 00:51.652
(helicopter blades whirring)

00:51.652 --> 00:54.325
HANG OUT A MINUTE. WE'LL SEND
THE GURNEY BACK DOWN.

00:54.325 --> 00:55.456
HEY, HEY.

00:55.456 --> 00:57.188
IT WON'T BE SO LOUD
ONCE YOU'RE INSIDE,

00:57.188 --> 00:59.190
AND THEN IT'S JUST--
IT'S JUST FUN, OKAY?

00:59.190 --> 01:02.833
(whirring continues)

01:06.537 --> 01:08.399
I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU CAN EVEN PRETEND

01:08.399 --> 01:09.770
THIS ISN'T AN ISSUE.

01:09.770 --> 01:11.372
BECAUSE IT'S NOT.

01:11.372 --> 01:13.344
WERE YOU EVEN GONNA TELL ME
YOU WANTED TO ADOPT HIM?

01:13.344 --> 01:14.505
WELL, THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN,
SO--

01:14.505 --> 01:15.846
BUT YOU WANTED TO.

01:15.846 --> 01:17.208
(thunderclap)

01:17.208 --> 01:18.579
OWEN...

01:18.579 --> 01:20.111
YOU WANT KIDS.

01:20.111 --> 01:22.213
THIS IS ABOUT ONE KID,
THIS KID WHO NEEDED--

01:22.213 --> 01:24.555
OKAY, BUT THE FACT THAT
YOU ARE LYING TO YOURSELF

01:24.555 --> 01:26.557
DOESN'T MAKE ME FEEL BETTER
ABOUT YOU LYING TO ME.

01:26.557 --> 01:28.619
I AM NOT LYING ABOUT THE FACT
THAT I LOVE YOU

01:28.619 --> 01:30.521
AND I WANT MY LIFE
TO BE WITH YOU.

01:30.521 --> 01:32.363
YOU DON'T THINK YOU'RE GONNA
LOOK AT ME ONE DAY

01:32.363 --> 01:34.625
AND ONLY SEE THE THINGS
I COULDN'T GIVE YOU?

01:34.625 --> 01:36.167
GOD, HAS IT EVER
OCCURRED TO YOU

01:36.167 --> 01:37.298
I MIGHT KNOW MY OWN MIND
BETTER THAN YOU?

01:37.298 --> 01:38.469
(clatters)

01:38.469 --> 01:40.731
(smartphone chimes)

01:40.731 --> 01:42.303
(whirring continues)

01:42.303 --> 01:44.335
OH, MY GOD.

01:44.335 --> 01:45.306
(thunderclap)

01:45.306 --> 01:47.478
AH! OH. OOH.

01:47.478 --> 01:49.280
(door opens)
(groans)

01:49.280 --> 01:51.282
FIGURES YOU'D GO INTO LABOR
IN THE MIDDLE OF A SUPER STORM.

01:51.282 --> 01:52.683
OKAY, WE NEED TO GO OVER
YOUR BIRTH PLAN.

01:52.683 --> 01:54.345
WE NEVER TALKED DETAILS.
HANG ON.

01:54.345 --> 01:56.687
I CAN'T BULLY PEOPLE UNLESS
I KNOW WHAT TO BULLY THEM ABOUT.

01:56.687 --> 01:58.349
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
GET BACK INTO BED.
YOU WANT TO GO BACK TO BED?

01:58.349 --> 01:59.690
NO!
SHE SAYS NO.

01:59.690 --> 02:01.792
OHH!
WHAT DO YOU NEED--
A PILLOW, A BOUNCY BALL?

02:01.792 --> 02:03.224
ICE CHIPS.
SHE SAYS ICE CHIPS.

02:03.224 --> 02:04.195
ARE YOU GONNA DO THIS
THE WHOLE TIME?

02:04.195 --> 02:05.356
(elevator bell dings)
UH-HUH.

02:05.356 --> 02:06.527
OKAY, I'M GONNA
CHECK ON CONNIE,

02:06.527 --> 02:07.858
SEE WHAT'S TAKING HER
SO LONG.

02:07.858 --> 02:10.431
OH, SHE'S WITH OTHER
LABORING MOMS RIGHT NOW.

02:10.431 --> 02:12.603
SHE'S BUSY. OHH.
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE I CARE
ABOUT. THE REST CAN WAIT.

02:12.603 --> 02:14.205
OOH. OOH.

02:14.205 --> 02:15.536
DID YOU TALK TO OWEN?
(blowing air rhythmically)

02:15.536 --> 02:17.208
YES AND NO.

02:17.208 --> 02:18.869
GOD, HOW IS YOUR PAIN NOW--
7, 8?

02:18.869 --> 02:20.241
9.
OOH.

02:20.241 --> 02:21.272
TALK TO ME ABOUT OWEN.
IT HELPS.

02:21.272 --> 02:23.274
UH, WELL, OWEN IS...

02:23.274 --> 02:24.815
AT A 10.
OHH.

02:24.815 --> 02:26.377
(grunts)

02:26.377 --> 02:28.319
(thunder rumbling)

02:28.319 --> 02:29.420
THIS GUY WAS CLEANING
HIS GUTTERS

02:29.420 --> 02:30.921
IN HURRICANE-FORCE WINDS.

02:30.921 --> 02:33.424
IT'S LIKE HE WANTED TO SPEND
THE NIGHT ON AN O.R. TABLE.

02:33.424 --> 02:34.885
NOT THAT I'M COMPLAINING.

02:34.885 --> 02:36.287
YOU'RE AWFULLY EXCITED ABOUT
ANOTHER MAN'S MISFORTUNES.

02:36.287 --> 02:37.588
NO, I JUST MEANT

02:37.588 --> 02:39.860
I'M GLAD DR. BAILEY'S
GETTING BACK INTO AN O.R.

02:39.860 --> 02:42.433
YEAH, SO AM I.

02:42.433 --> 02:43.464
(snaps)

02:43.464 --> 02:45.536
(stretches and snaps)

02:45.536 --> 02:49.440
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

02:50.841 --> 02:54.174
MM. I CAN'T DO THIS.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.546
(Velcro crackles)
MIRANDA...

02:55.546 --> 02:57.278
(fabric rustles)

02:57.278 --> 02:58.509
(sighs)

02:58.509 --> 02:59.910
(man) GO BACK INSIDE.

02:59.910 --> 03:02.182
(woman speaks indistinctly)

03:02.182 --> 03:04.184
ALL RIGHT, WHAT IS
OUR RISK OF FLOODING HERE?

03:04.184 --> 03:05.656
OH, YOU GOT WATER PUMPS.
YOU GOT SANDBAGS.

03:05.656 --> 03:07.187
THE LIGHTS
KEEP FLICKERING.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.459
NOW ARE THE GENERATORS--

03:08.459 --> 03:09.620
I TESTED 'EM LAST MONTH.

03:09.620 --> 03:10.921
LISTEN, YOU GUYS GOT
PATIENTS TO WORRY ABOUT.

03:10.921 --> 03:12.293
YOU TAKE CARE OF THEM.

03:12.293 --> 03:13.694
THIS--THIS HOSPITAL'S
MY PATIENT.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.226
(sighs)

03:15.226 --> 03:16.827
THESE BEDS
ARE FILLING UP FAST.

03:16.827 --> 03:18.599
YEAH, PEOPLE THINK THIS IS
THE SAFEST PLACE

03:18.599 --> 03:19.770
TO SIT OUT A STORM.

03:19.770 --> 03:21.272
HALF THESE PEOPLE
AREN'T EVEN SICK.

03:21.272 --> 03:22.233
THEY'RE JUST SCARED.

03:22.233 --> 03:24.275
YEAH.
CHRISTIAN.

03:24.275 --> 03:25.436
(woman) DR. CHANEY
TO E.R. TRIAGE...

03:25.436 --> 03:27.238
(chuckles)
NOT USED TO IT YET?

03:27.238 --> 03:28.909
IT JUST FEELS REALLY WEIRD
ON MY FINGER.

03:28.909 --> 03:30.511
I KEEP RUNNING IT
INTO STUFF.

03:30.511 --> 03:32.883
PIN IT
TO YOUR SCRUB TOP.

03:32.883 --> 03:34.385
OH, COOL.

03:34.385 --> 03:35.616
MM-HMM.

03:35.616 --> 03:38.549
CHIEF. HEY, UH, THERE'S
A PATIENT IN O.R. TWO

03:38.549 --> 03:40.621
WHO NEEDS AN EXPLORATORY LAP
IMMEDIATELY.

03:40.621 --> 03:41.952
THE PATIENT'S ALREADY UNDER.

03:41.952 --> 03:44.255
DO YOU HAVE
ANY GENERAL SURGEONS AVAILABLE?

03:44.255 --> 03:45.896
YOU LOOK AVAILABLE.

03:45.896 --> 03:47.298
(elevator bell dings)

03:47.298 --> 03:48.399
I-I'M NOT, SIR.

03:48.399 --> 03:50.230
(man) UH, UH, EXCUSE ME.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.432
E-EXCUSE ME.

03:51.432 --> 03:53.404
UH, YOU'RE MY SON'S DOCTOR--
JIMMY STRICKLAND?

03:53.404 --> 03:55.336
IS HE DONE WITH SURGERY
ALREADY?

03:55.336 --> 03:57.468
NO, SIR.
UH, WE HAVEN'T STARTED YET.

03:57.468 --> 03:59.440
I-IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

03:59.440 --> 04:02.473
UM, EVERYTHING IS FINE,
SIR.

04:02.473 --> 04:04.675
UH, I'LL BE THE DOCTOR
OPERATING ON YOUR SON.

04:04.675 --> 04:06.277
WILL YOU WALK WITH ME,
MR. STRICKLAND,

04:06.277 --> 04:08.279
AND FILL ME IN
ON WHAT HAPPENED?

04:08.279 --> 04:09.720
(indistinct conversations)

04:09.720 --> 04:11.021
(woman) DR. SIMMONS TO THE E.R.
DR. SIMMONS TO THE E.R.

04:11.021 --> 04:14.254
I WOULD LIKE TO HELP OUT,
CHIEF, HOWEVER I CAN.

04:14.254 --> 04:17.027
WELL, IT MAKES IT HARD
WHEN YOU WON'T TOUCH A PATIENT.

04:17.027 --> 04:19.760
ACTUALLY, I WAS GONNA SUGGEST
THAT WE GET SOMEONE

04:19.760 --> 04:21.992
TO MAKE SURE THERE'S ENOUGH
SURPLUS BLOOD IN THE O.R.s.

04:21.992 --> 04:23.794
(woman) DR. GRANT,
EXTENSION 2-2-7-9.

04:23.794 --> 04:24.965
DR. GRANT, EXTENSION 2-2-7-9

04:24.965 --> 04:26.497
YEAH. OKAY.

04:26.497 --> 04:28.439
(door opens)
CUT HER SOME SLACK.

04:28.439 --> 04:30.301
(indistinct conversations
continue)

04:30.301 --> 04:31.502
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

04:31.502 --> 04:34.345
A-A TREE.

04:34.345 --> 04:35.776
KAREV, IF YOU'RE FREE,

04:35.776 --> 04:37.508
THE NICU NEEDS HELP GETTING
ALL THESE BABIES OUT OF HERE.

04:37.508 --> 04:39.350
I THOUGHT ARIZONA
WAS OVERSEEING THIS.

04:39.350 --> 04:41.281
HAS ANYONE SEEN HER?

04:41.281 --> 04:44.585
(thunder rumbling)

04:44.585 --> 04:46.787
HEY, YOU OKAY?

04:46.787 --> 04:48.389
(grunts) UH, YEAH, NO.

04:48.389 --> 04:51.322
THE NICU'S JUST UNDERSTAFFED,
AND I SHOULD BE THERE ALREADY.

04:51.322 --> 04:52.663
YOU NEED AN EXTRA SET
OF HANDS?

04:52.663 --> 04:55.366
OH, NO. PLEASE, JUST...

04:55.366 --> 04:56.667
NO.

04:56.667 --> 04:58.329
(door opens)

04:58.329 --> 04:59.299
I UNDERSTAND
YOUR CONCERNS, TIM,

04:59.299 --> 05:00.531
BUT WE WERE JUST TOLD

05:00.531 --> 05:02.473
TO EVACUATE
THE HIGHEST PRIORITIES FIRST.

05:02.473 --> 05:04.034
SO CRYSTAL'S BABY
GETS TAKEN TO SAFETY

05:04.034 --> 05:05.576
AND MINE IS STUCK HERE?

05:05.576 --> 05:08.379
IT'S PERFECTLY SAFE HERE,
TIM. (exhales) OKAY?

05:08.379 --> 05:10.611
THE PIT SAYS WE HAVE TO SUSPEND
EVACUATIONS DUE TO THE WEATHER.

05:10.611 --> 05:12.012
WAIT. WE WERE
JUST DOWN THERE.

05:12.012 --> 05:13.514
THE LAST RIG TO LEAVE
COULDN'T EVEN MAKE IT

05:13.514 --> 05:15.386
OUT OF THE PARKING LOT.
(electricity crackling)

05:15.386 --> 05:17.388
(parents speaking indistinctly)
(Arizona) OH, WHOA.
OKAY. DON'T WORRY.

05:17.388 --> 05:18.449
DON'T WORRY.

05:18.449 --> 05:19.720
ALL OF OUR STAFF
IS VERY WELL TRAINED,

05:19.720 --> 05:21.692
AND YOUR BABIES ARE
IN VERY GOOD HANDS, OKAY?

05:21.692 --> 05:24.024
(lowered voice)
I ONLY SEE TWO NURSES.

05:24.024 --> 05:25.696
NO ONE ELSE MADE IT IN
FOR THEIR SHIFT?

05:25.696 --> 05:27.758
OH, OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
THIS IS IMPORTANT.

05:27.758 --> 05:29.960
THE MAKERS OF TINY HUMANS
GET EASILY SPOOKED.

05:29.960 --> 05:33.033
IT IS OUR JOB TONIGHT TO KEEP
THE TINY HUMAN MAKERS HAPPY,

05:33.033 --> 05:34.905
OR THEY WILL MUTINY,
AND WE ARE OUTNUMBERED.

05:34.905 --> 05:38.038
WE REMAIN CALM.
WE REMAIN CONFIDENT.

05:38.038 --> 05:40.541
BECAUSE EVERYTHING
IS JUST FINE. UNDERSTOOD?

05:40.541 --> 05:41.772
YOU NEED SOME HELP?
(elevator bell dings)

05:41.772 --> 05:43.614
YES.
(normal voice) NO.

05:43.614 --> 05:45.045
I-I THOUGHT
THAT I TOLD YOU--

05:45.045 --> 05:46.577
I'M NOT GONNA SIT
ON MY HANDS

05:46.577 --> 05:48.078
WHILE THERE'S A ROOMFUL
OF BABIES THAT NEED HELP.

05:48.078 --> 05:49.349
WHAT CAN I DO?

05:49.349 --> 05:50.751
YOU CAN CROSS-CHECK
THE MED REC FORMS

05:50.751 --> 05:52.082
SO WE CAN GET
THE CORRECT DOSAGES.

05:52.082 --> 05:53.854
WE'RE OUTNUMBERED.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.686
KEEP THE TINY HUMAN MAKERS
HAPPY, RIGHT?

05:55.686 --> 05:59.059
(indistinct conversations)

05:59.059 --> 06:01.061
WELL, I DIDN'T EXPECT
TO SEE YOU AGAIN SO SOON.

06:01.061 --> 06:02.833
HER CONTRACTIONS
ARE EVERY THREE MINUTES.

06:02.833 --> 06:04.435
AND SHE
DOESN'T WANT DRUGS.

06:04.435 --> 06:06.066
I HAVE DR. KNOX AVAILABLE
IN CASE SHE CHANGES HER MIND.

06:06.066 --> 06:07.398
LOOK,
SHE DOESN'T WANT DRUGS.

06:07.398 --> 06:08.599
OKAY, CAN EVERYBODY
JUST PLEASE SHUT UP?

06:08.599 --> 06:10.571
I WANT TO PUSH.
I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO PUSH.

06:10.571 --> 06:11.742
CAN I PUSH?

06:11.742 --> 06:13.944
I JUST NEED TO CHECK
FIRST...

06:13.944 --> 06:15.446
(thunder rumbling)

06:15.446 --> 06:16.747
WHAT'S GOING ON?

06:16.747 --> 06:18.909
MEREDITH, I NEED YOU
NOT TO PUSH.

06:18.909 --> 06:20.451
WHY?

06:20.451 --> 06:23.053
THERE'S FACE PRESENTATION.
I CAN FEEL YOUR BABY'S FACE.

06:23.053 --> 06:25.155
SO WE'RE GONNA NEED TO DO
A C-SECTION.

06:25.155 --> 06:27.087
A C-SECTION?
I DO NOT WANT TO HAVE SURGERY.

06:27.087 --> 06:28.459
I KNOW.

06:28.459 --> 06:29.920
ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S JUST A "C."

06:29.920 --> 06:32.463
THAT'S BARELY SURGERY.
A MORON COULD DO A "C."

06:32.463 --> 06:33.624
I--NO OFFENSE.

06:33.624 --> 06:35.766
(thunderclap,
electricity crackles)

06:35.766 --> 06:37.628
(Meredith) OKAY.

06:37.628 --> 06:39.169
(Derek) WELL, DON'T PANIC.
IT'S JUST A POWER OUTAGE.

06:39.169 --> 06:40.400
THERE ARE GENERATORS.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.102
THE POWER'S GONNA GO ON
ANY SECOND.

06:42.102 --> 06:43.574
YEAH, IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

06:43.574 --> 06:45.175
(thunder rumbling)

06:45.175 --> 06:46.577
DEREK?

06:46.577 --> 06:48.108
YEAH, ANY SECOND.

06:48.108 --> 06:50.180
(grunts)

06:50.180 --> 06:51.442
(rumbling continues)

06:51.442 --> 06:58.749
(electricity crackling)

07:02.953 --> 07:04.054
OKAY, STAY CALM.

07:04.054 --> 07:05.425
LET'S GET SOME FLASHLIGHTS,

07:05.425 --> 07:06.797
ALL THE LIGHT
THAT YOU CAN FIND.

07:06.797 --> 07:08.829
SOMEBODY GET ME A HEADLAMP.
(woman) RIGHT AWAY, DOCTOR.

07:08.829 --> 07:10.461
DR. WARREN, HOW'S THE GAS?

07:10.461 --> 07:12.202
GOOD. BACKUP BATTERY
SWITCHED ITSELF ON.

07:12.202 --> 07:13.634
HIS B.P. IS STILL DROPPING,
THOUGH.

07:13.634 --> 07:15.466
I CAN'T SEE
WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.

07:15.466 --> 07:17.207
WHY ISN'T THE ECHO
ON BATTERY POWER?

07:17.207 --> 07:19.139
THERE SHOULD BE
A MANUAL SWITCH.
ROSS, GO LOOK.

07:19.139 --> 07:21.472
(door opens)
(Owen) I KNOW THE GENERATOR
SHOULD BE ON.

07:21.472 --> 07:22.913
I'M ASKING WHY IT'S NOT.

07:22.913 --> 07:24.645
WEBBER, I'M CHECKING IN.
DO YOU NEED ANYTHING?

07:24.645 --> 07:26.917
SOME LIGHT WOULD BE GOOD.
THE EMERGENCY LIGHTS
SHOULDA KICKED ON.

07:26.917 --> 07:28.448
WELL, THEY DIDN'T.

07:28.448 --> 07:29.780
(Richard) FRANK, WHEN
THE GENERATOR WENT OUT IN '06,

07:29.780 --> 07:31.482
YOU SAID THERE WAS
AIR IN THE FUEL SYSTEM.

07:31.482 --> 07:34.485
THEN YOU TOLD ME THAT
IT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.
YES, SIR.

07:34.485 --> 07:36.126
WELL, THEN MAYBE YOU SHOULD
GET YOUR ASS DOWN THERE

07:36.126 --> 07:37.488
AND GET LOOKIN'.

07:37.488 --> 07:38.789
I'VE GOT A MAN OPEN
ON THE TABLE HERE.

07:38.789 --> 07:40.090
YES, SIR.

07:40.090 --> 07:41.592
HANG IN THERE, PEOPLE.
WE'RE WORKING ON IT.

07:41.592 --> 07:42.793
(door opens)
THAT PROBABLY HELPED.

07:42.793 --> 07:44.995
YELLING AT THE GUY.
(beeps)

07:44.995 --> 07:46.537
(whooshing)
YES! I GOT IT!

07:46.537 --> 07:47.798
DAMN IT.
PERICARDIAL EFFUSION.

07:47.798 --> 07:49.039
PAGE RUSSELL.

07:49.039 --> 07:50.470
UH, I DON'T BELIEVE
HE MADE IT IN, SIR,

07:50.470 --> 07:51.702
BECAUSE OF THE STORM.

07:51.702 --> 07:53.173
DR. YANG'S THE SENIOR CARDIO
SURGEON IN CHARGE.

07:53.173 --> 07:55.145
OKAY, THEN GET YANG.
(whooshing continues)

07:55.145 --> 07:56.707
CAN'T YOU JUST
ROTATE THE BABY

07:56.707 --> 07:58.208
AND--AND PUSH HIS FACE AWAY?

07:58.208 --> 08:00.951
IT'S VERY RISKY,
FOR THE BABY, FOR MEREDITH.
OOH.

08:00.951 --> 08:02.212
UH, DR. YANG.

08:02.212 --> 08:03.814
DR. WEBBER NEEDS YOU
IN O.R. TWO.

08:03.814 --> 08:05.886
TO DO WHAT? I CAN'T
OPERATE IN THE DARK.

08:05.886 --> 08:07.918
(exhales)
NO ONE IS OPERATING
IN THE DARK.

08:07.918 --> 08:09.760
OKAY, JUST GO.
I'LL BE FINE.

08:09.760 --> 08:12.062
(thunder rumbling)

08:12.062 --> 08:13.524
OKAY, HAPPY, COME HERE

08:13.524 --> 08:16.166
AND UPDATE ME AS SOON
AS THEY'VE MADE A DECISION.

08:16.166 --> 08:19.099
SO WHAT ARE THE RISKS
OF REPOSITIONING THE BABY?

08:19.099 --> 08:21.231
NOT THE MINOR RISKS.
THE BIG, UGLY, SCARY RISKS.

08:21.231 --> 08:23.674
BECAUSE I'M A LIGHTNING ROD
FOR THOSE.

08:23.674 --> 08:25.175
IT'S NOT AN OPTION.
WHY NOT?

08:25.175 --> 08:26.537
ARE YOU SAYING BABIES
WITH FACE PRESENTATION

08:26.537 --> 08:27.678
CAN'T BE BORN NATURALLY?

08:27.678 --> 08:29.540
IT'S NOT A GOOD OPTION.

08:29.540 --> 08:30.811
NEITHER IS CUTTING
INTO MY WIFE IN THE DARK.

08:30.811 --> 08:31.882
HOW MANY BABIES HAVE YOU
DELIVERED IN YOUR CAREER,

08:31.882 --> 08:33.043
DR. SHEPHERD?

08:33.043 --> 08:35.085
WHAT, A COUPLE, MAYBE MORE?

08:35.085 --> 08:37.548
WHEN I SAY A VAGINAL DELIVERY
ISN'T AN OPTION,

08:37.548 --> 08:39.189
I MEAN, IT'S NOT AN OPTION.

08:39.189 --> 08:40.250
OOH.
MM.

08:40.250 --> 08:42.252
NOW I COULD STAND HERE
AND WASTE TIME

08:42.252 --> 08:45.525
EXPLAINING HOW YOUR BABY IS IN
A MENTO-POSTERIOR POSITION

08:45.525 --> 08:47.157
AND HOW PUSHING A BABY
LIKE THAT

08:47.157 --> 08:49.700
WILL HYPEREXTEND ITS NECK,

08:49.700 --> 08:51.762
WHICH CAN BE FATAL,

08:51.762 --> 08:53.764
OR I CAN BETTER SPEND MY TIME
PREPPING YOUR WIFE...
(exhales)

08:53.764 --> 08:55.535
AND BABY FOR A DELIVERY

08:55.535 --> 08:57.738
THAT WILL NOT ENDANGER
EITHER OF THEIR LIVES.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.269
SO...

08:59.269 --> 09:00.270
WHICH DO YOU PREFER?

09:00.270 --> 09:02.272
(rumbling continues)

09:02.272 --> 09:04.915
WE'RE HAVING A C-SECTION
IN THE DARK.

09:04.915 --> 09:07.077
YES...

09:07.077 --> 09:08.278
WE ARE.

09:08.278 --> 09:10.320
THE VENTS KICKED ON
TO BATTERY POWER?

09:10.320 --> 09:12.723
I CHECKED THEM ALL TWICE.
THEY'RE WORKING.

09:12.723 --> 09:14.254
ALL THE BABIES
ARE BREATHING.

09:14.254 --> 09:16.256
GOOD.
(babies fussing and crying)

09:16.256 --> 09:18.859
(exhales) LISTEN, UH,

09:18.859 --> 09:21.291
WE WERE TALKING BEFORE
THE WHOLE TREE THING HAPPENED--

09:21.291 --> 09:23.664
IT'S FINE. WE--YOU CAN JUST
FORGET THAT I--

09:23.664 --> 09:25.596
UM, NO SUDDEN MOVES.
WILSON, DON'T TURN AROUND.

09:25.596 --> 09:27.167
UH, KAREV,
CAN YOU DISCREETLY

09:27.167 --> 09:28.739
CHECK OUT THAT MONITOR
BEHIND ME,

09:28.739 --> 09:30.300
THE ONE
FOR CRYSTAL'S BABY VENT?

09:30.300 --> 09:31.742
DO YOU SEE THAT RED LIGHT?

09:31.742 --> 09:32.943
YES.

09:32.943 --> 09:34.144
THAT'S THE LOW-BATTERY LIGHT,
RIGHT?

09:34.144 --> 09:35.305
OH, CRAP.
KEEP SMILING.

09:35.305 --> 09:37.277
MM.
OKAY, UH,

09:37.277 --> 09:38.609
WILSON, WILL YOU GO CHECK
THE DRAWER OVER THERE

09:38.609 --> 09:39.780
WHERE WE KEEP
THE SPARE BATTERIES?

09:39.780 --> 09:41.011
TELL ME WHAT YOU SEE.
MM-HMM.

09:41.011 --> 09:43.213
SLOWLY AND CASUALLY.

09:43.213 --> 09:44.855
(clears throat)

09:44.855 --> 09:47.357
(rainfall)

09:47.357 --> 09:48.919
(indistinct conversations)

09:48.919 --> 09:50.320
NO BATTERIES.

09:50.320 --> 09:51.922
(exhales) OKAY.

09:51.922 --> 09:54.164
OKAY. NO ONE PANICS.

09:54.164 --> 09:56.126
I AM GOING TO LOOK
FOR SPARE BATTERIES

09:56.126 --> 09:57.267
WHILE YOU ALL ACT LIKE
NOTHING'S WRONG.

09:57.267 --> 09:59.069
UNDERSTAND ME? NOTHING'S WRONG.

09:59.069 --> 10:00.831
SOMETHING'S WRONG?

10:00.831 --> 10:02.002
NO.

10:02.002 --> 10:06.106
(thunder rumbling)

10:06.106 --> 10:07.277
(hinges squeak)

10:07.277 --> 10:08.608
(Ben) BLOOD'S HERE.

10:08.608 --> 10:11.241
OH, UH, THANK YOU, NURSE.

10:11.241 --> 10:13.383
OH, UH,
I'M--I'M SORRY, BAILEY.

10:13.383 --> 10:14.915
(clicks keyboard keys)
I THOUGHT YOU WERE--

10:14.915 --> 10:16.286
I'M JUST TRYING TO DO
WHAT I CAN TO HELP OUT.

10:16.286 --> 10:18.118
FOUR UNITS A.B.-NEG.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.349
(door opens)

10:19.349 --> 10:20.821
(door closes)

10:20.821 --> 10:22.022
I YELLED AT HER.

10:22.022 --> 10:24.294
I THOUGHT IT WOULD WORK,

10:24.294 --> 10:26.196
THAT TOUGH LOVE
IS WHAT SHE NEEDED

10:26.196 --> 10:28.028
TO GET HER BACK INSIDE
THE O.R.

10:28.028 --> 10:29.199
I JOINED IN

10:29.199 --> 10:30.931
AS AN ANESTHESIOLOGIST
ON THIS SURGERY

10:30.931 --> 10:33.303
BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT WOULD
GET HER BACK IN THIS O.R.

10:33.303 --> 10:35.666
MY WAY DIDN'T WORK EITHER.

10:35.666 --> 10:36.837
(Cristina sighs)
THERE'S BLOOD IN THERE,

10:36.837 --> 10:38.168
EXITING THE HEART.

10:38.168 --> 10:40.971
I CAN'T FIND OUT WHERE
UNLESS I OPEN HIM UP.

10:40.971 --> 10:42.813
(thunderclap)

10:42.813 --> 10:44.875
AND I'M NOT OPENING HIS CHEST
WITH NO LIGHT.

10:44.875 --> 10:46.346
(thunder rumbling)

10:46.346 --> 10:49.149
I AM NOT OPERATING
ON PEOPLE IN THE DARK.

10:49.149 --> 10:51.321
SIR, I CANNOT OPERATE
UNDER THESE CONDITIONS.

10:51.321 --> 10:52.683
DIDN'T WE
JUST TEACH THE SYRIANS

10:52.683 --> 10:53.854
HOW TO OPERATE
UNDER THESE CONDITIONS?

10:53.854 --> 10:55.025
I'M NOT IN SYRIA.

10:55.025 --> 10:56.957
YANG,
THIS IS JAMES STRICKLAND.

10:56.957 --> 10:59.930
HE'S GOT A WIFE--CAROL--
AND FOUR KIDS BACK IN ARIZONA.

10:59.930 --> 11:01.391
JAMES' DAD IS 80 AND ALONE

11:01.391 --> 11:03.694
SINCE JAMES' MOM DIED
ON CHRISTMAS.

11:03.694 --> 11:06.236
AND HE'S FAR TOO STUBBORN
TO MOVE INTO ASSISTED LIVING,

11:06.236 --> 11:08.368
WHICH IS WHY
JAMES FOUND HIMSELF

11:08.368 --> 11:10.670
ON HIS FATHER'S ROOF
TRYING TO CLEAN OUT HIS GUTTER

11:10.670 --> 11:13.673
WHEN THE STORM HIT.

11:13.673 --> 11:17.047
HE WAS JUST TRYING
TO TAKE CARE OF HIS DAD.

11:17.047 --> 11:19.379
HE'S A GOOD MAN.

11:19.379 --> 11:23.113
AND HE WILL DIE ON THIS TABLE
IF YOU DON'T OPERATE, YANG.

11:23.113 --> 11:25.886
WHILE WE STAND AROUND
AND WATCH,

11:25.886 --> 11:29.860
THIS MAN WILL DIE.

11:29.860 --> 11:33.023
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

11:33.023 --> 11:36.096
(sighs) I'LL SCRUB IN.

11:36.096 --> 11:38.829
(thunder rumbling)

11:38.829 --> 11:40.771
(Connie)
YOU TWO OWN THE HOSPITAL.

11:40.771 --> 11:42.472
CAN I REQUEST THAT O.R.s
BE STOCKED WITH

11:42.472 --> 11:44.204
MORE THAN ONE FLASHLIGHT
IN THE FUTURE?

11:44.204 --> 11:45.876
YOU GET THIS BABY
OUT OF ME SAFELY,

11:45.876 --> 11:48.839
AND YOU CAN HAVE
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

11:48.839 --> 11:50.040
WHAT ABOUT WILLIAM?

11:50.040 --> 11:51.311
I LIKE SEBASTIAN.

11:51.311 --> 11:53.343
SEBASTIAN SHEPHERD?
THAT'S A BIT OF A MOUTHFUL.

11:53.343 --> 11:54.785
BROOKS?

11:54.785 --> 11:57.347
I'M NOT GIVING BIRTH
TO A COUNTRY SINGER.

11:57.347 --> 11:59.149
NO, IT'S--I SEE HEATHER.

11:59.149 --> 12:00.490
BROOKS.

12:00.490 --> 12:03.253
DUDE, YOU'RE OPERATING
IN THE DARK ON YOUR WIFE?

12:03.253 --> 12:05.956
YEAH.
UH, CHIEF HUNT ASKED ME
TO GO TO THE O.R.s

12:05.956 --> 12:07.858
AND LET THEM KNOW THAT
THEY GUY IS TRYING TO FIX

12:07.858 --> 12:09.029
THE EMERGENCY LIGHTS.

12:09.029 --> 12:10.260
WE COULD USE A HAND
WITH THESE LIGHTS.

12:10.260 --> 12:11.401
(thunderclap)

12:11.401 --> 12:13.804
OKAY, HERE WE GO.

12:13.804 --> 12:15.065
WAIT. I'M SCARED.

12:15.065 --> 12:16.436
THERE IS NOTHING
TO BE SCARED OF.

12:16.436 --> 12:17.808
WE CAN DO THIS.

12:17.808 --> 12:19.209
EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE.

12:19.209 --> 12:21.241
OKAY?

12:24.374 --> 12:26.146
DON'T MESS THIS UP.

12:26.146 --> 12:28.418
SIT DOWN, PLEASE,
SO I CAN WORK.

12:28.418 --> 12:31.822
(thunder rumbling)

12:33.483 --> 12:36.256
OKAY, LET'S GO.
ROSS, LIGHT.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.759
A COUPLE OF PEOPLE
HAVE ASKED FOR TWO BLANKETS.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.091
ONE PER PERSON.
THAT'S IT.

12:41.091 --> 12:43.133
MATTHEW,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

12:43.133 --> 12:44.364
MY RIG STALLED OUT
IN THE RIVER

12:44.364 --> 12:45.896
THAT USED TO BE
PIKE STREET.

12:45.896 --> 12:47.237
I WALKED
THE REST OF THE WAY HERE.

12:47.237 --> 12:48.398
HOW CAN I HELP?

12:48.398 --> 12:49.840
GRAB SOME BLANKETS.
OKAY.

12:49.840 --> 12:51.401
OKAY, NOW ORDINARILY,
I'D DISCHARGE YOU,

12:51.401 --> 12:53.173
BUT FOR NOW,
THIS IS HOME, ALL RIGHT?

12:53.173 --> 12:55.045
TORRES, BLOOD'S BEEN
DISTRIBUTED.
(man speaks indistinctly)

12:55.045 --> 12:56.376
ANYTHING ELSE I CAN DO?

12:56.376 --> 12:57.377
(woman) YOU HEAR THAT NOISE?
(metal clattering)

12:57.377 --> 12:59.179
OH!

12:59.179 --> 13:01.381
(motor whirring)
(woman screams)

13:01.381 --> 13:03.153
(woman) OH, MY GOD!

13:03.153 --> 13:04.314
(metal screeching)
(man) IT FLIPPED RIGHT OVER.

13:04.314 --> 13:06.016
OH, MY GOD.
(man) OH, MAN.

13:06.016 --> 13:08.088
(screeching continues)

13:08.088 --> 13:10.020
(woman) WHAT HAPPENED?
(man) I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST--

13:10.020 --> 13:11.491
(indistinct shouting)

13:11.491 --> 13:13.263
(woman) OH, MY GOD. FIRE!

13:13.263 --> 13:14.464
OH, MY GOD.
(man) THE BUS CAUGHT ON FIRE!

13:14.464 --> 13:18.969
(indistinct shouting)

13:24.474 --> 13:25.805
(woman) HURRY! HURRY!
(April) I SMELL GAS.

13:25.805 --> 13:26.837
(Matthew)
THERE'S A FUEL LEAK SOMEWHERE.

13:26.837 --> 13:28.008
(man) WE WERE COMING
FROM THE CHURCH,

13:28.008 --> 13:29.209
TRYING TO WAIT OUT THE STORM.

13:29.209 --> 13:30.380
CAREFUL.
(speaks indistinctly)

13:30.380 --> 13:31.411
THE ROOF, IT CAVED IN ON US.

13:31.411 --> 13:33.043
WE HAD NOWHERE ELSE TO GO.

13:33.043 --> 13:35.045
(Owen) WE'VE GOT TO GET
EVERYONE AWAY FROM THIS FIRE.

13:35.045 --> 13:37.317
(man) EASY. EASY.
ALL RIGHT, IF YOU CAN WALK,
LET'S GET YOU INSIDE! THIS WAY!

13:37.317 --> 13:40.350
(Owen) WE'RE GONNA NEED TO SETUP
AN EMERGENCY TRIAGE INSIDE.

13:40.350 --> 13:42.592
WE'RE GONNA NEED MEDS.
BAILEY, CAN YOU HANDLE THIS?

13:42.592 --> 13:44.594
Y-YEAH. UH, MURPHY!

13:44.594 --> 13:46.526
WE GOTTA MOVE, HUNT.
THIS THING'S GONNA BLOW.

13:46.526 --> 13:47.597
AVERY, HURRY UP!

13:47.597 --> 13:49.359
I GOT ONE MORE.

13:49.359 --> 13:52.202
SHE'S JAMMED BETWEEN TWO SEATS.
HELP ME GET HER OUT.
(grunts)

13:52.202 --> 13:55.235
THIS IS NOT HOW
I WANTED TO DO THIS.

13:55.235 --> 13:57.237
WELL, YOU ONCE SAID THAT
ABOUT MARRYING ME.

13:57.237 --> 13:58.408
LOOK HOW THAT TURNED OUT.

13:58.408 --> 13:59.369
(inhales and exhales
deeply)

13:59.369 --> 14:00.971
I LOVE YOU.

14:00.971 --> 14:02.142
MM.

14:02.142 --> 14:03.543
(Connie) AND YOUR BABY IS OUT.

14:03.543 --> 14:06.146
WHAT DO YOU SEE?
I DON'T KNOW. IT'S TOO DARK.

14:06.146 --> 14:08.919
I DON'T HEAR HIM CRYING.
WHY ISN'T HE CRYING?

14:10.420 --> 14:12.122
SOMEBODY TALK TO ME.

14:12.122 --> 14:14.454
I DON'T HEAR HIM CRYING.

14:16.426 --> 14:19.990
(indistinct whispers)

14:19.990 --> 14:21.992
(thunder rumbling)

14:21.992 --> 14:23.393
(indistinct whispers)

14:23.393 --> 14:25.535
(panting)

14:25.535 --> 14:26.897
(woman) ALL RIGHT.

14:26.897 --> 14:28.098
HERE YOU GO.

14:28.098 --> 14:31.601
(fusses)

14:31.601 --> 14:32.973
(Derek chuckles)

14:32.973 --> 14:35.305
(fussing continues)

14:35.305 --> 14:37.077
LOOK AT THAT.

14:37.077 --> 14:39.609
HE'S PERFECT.

14:39.609 --> 14:41.551
(laughing and crying)

14:41.551 --> 14:43.153
HE'S JUST PERFECT.

14:43.153 --> 14:45.255
(continues laughing
and crying)

14:45.255 --> 14:46.456
(chuckles)

14:46.456 --> 14:49.419
(thunder rumbling)

14:49.419 --> 14:51.391
(sniffles)

14:51.391 --> 14:55.095
(fusses)

14:55.095 --> 14:56.566
DEREK?

14:56.566 --> 14:58.468
HIS BREATHING IS SHALLOW.
HIS SATs ARE LOW.

14:58.468 --> 15:00.000
WHY ARE HIS SATs LOW?

15:00.000 --> 15:01.501
WELL, IN THE DARK LIKE THIS,
IT'S HARD TO BE SURE.

15:01.501 --> 15:03.103
BUT IT'S NOT UNCOMMON,

15:03.103 --> 15:04.604
ESPECIALLY IN BABIES LIKE THESE
THAT COME OUT EARLY.

15:04.604 --> 15:05.976
WE'LL GET HIM TO THE NICU

15:05.976 --> 15:07.277
AND MAKE SURE
EVERYTHING CHECKS OUT.

15:07.277 --> 15:08.478
DEREK, GO WITH HIM.

15:08.478 --> 15:10.310
DO NOT LEAVE HIS SIDE
FOR A SECOND.

15:10.310 --> 15:12.282
DO YOU HEAR ME?
OKAY.

15:12.282 --> 15:14.514
OKAY, GUYS,
DON'T LEAVE HER SIDE.

15:14.514 --> 15:15.946
MAKE SURE SHE'S OKAY.
YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

15:15.946 --> 15:17.447
GOT IT, BOSS.
YES, SIR.

15:22.322 --> 15:24.955
(pants)

15:24.955 --> 15:28.358
(exhales) ANOTHER BATTERY LIGHT
JUST WENT ON IN THERE.

15:28.358 --> 15:29.699
ANY LUCK?
NO.

15:29.699 --> 15:31.231
NO ONE THOUGHT ABOUT
SPARE BATTERIES.

15:31.231 --> 15:32.402
AND PRETTY SOON,

15:32.402 --> 15:33.533
ALL THOSE MACHINES
ARE GONNA DIE OUT THERE,

15:33.533 --> 15:35.435
AND THEN ALL THOSE BABIES
ARE GONNA DIE,

15:35.435 --> 15:38.168
AND ALL BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK
AHEAD TO STOCKPILE BATTERIES.

15:38.168 --> 15:40.040
AND ALSO, I CHEATED ON MY WIFE
WITH THAT...

15:40.040 --> 15:43.343
WOMAN OUT THERE,
AND I'M A HORRIBLE PERSON.

15:43.343 --> 15:44.674
I'M HORRIBLE.

15:44.674 --> 15:47.317
(thunder rumbling)

15:47.317 --> 15:48.718
HEY.

15:48.718 --> 15:50.520
I'M IN LOVE
WITH THAT INTERN OUT THERE,

15:50.520 --> 15:51.681
BUT I WON'T TELL HER.

15:51.681 --> 15:53.553
AND I KEEP SAYING TO MYSELF
I WON'T TELL HER

15:53.553 --> 15:55.125
BECAUSE EVERYONE I LOVE
TURNS OUT TO BE CRAZY

15:55.125 --> 15:58.188
OR MEAN OR CANCER-Y
OR--OR LEAVES.

15:58.188 --> 16:00.390
BUT THE THING ALL THOSE WOMEN
HAVE IN COMMON IS ME.

16:00.390 --> 16:03.393
THEY WERE ALL FINE
BEFORE THEY MET ME.

16:03.393 --> 16:06.566
I'M... DAMAGED GOODS
OR SOMETHING.

16:06.566 --> 16:10.570
SO YOU'RE NOT THE WORST PERSON
IN THIS CLOSET.

16:12.042 --> 16:13.703
THERE ARE NO BATTERIES
IN HERE.

16:13.703 --> 16:16.306
WHAT THE HELL
ARE WE GONNA DO?

16:16.306 --> 16:17.547
I HAVE NO IDEA.

16:17.547 --> 16:19.709
OKAY, WE NEED ANTIBIOTICS,
ANTI-INFLAMMATORIES,

16:19.709 --> 16:22.582
AND PAIN MEDS--
LOTS OF PAIN MEDS.

16:22.582 --> 16:24.614
I'VE NEVER HEARD SCREAMS
LIKE THAT BEFORE.

16:24.614 --> 16:27.357
OH, NO. IT'S DEAD.

16:27.357 --> 16:28.518
THERE'S NO WAY FOR ME TO...
(clicks keys)

16:28.518 --> 16:30.420
PUNCH IN MY CODE.

16:30.420 --> 16:33.193
(clatters)
HOW--HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO GET MEDS IF...

16:33.193 --> 16:37.467
OH, COME ON. OPEN.

16:37.467 --> 16:38.428
HE LOOKED GOOD, RIGHT?

16:38.428 --> 16:39.669
I MEAN, THAT--
THAT CRY WAS LOUD.

16:39.669 --> 16:41.401
AND HE--HE LOOKED GOOD.
YOU SAW HIM, RIGHT?

16:41.401 --> 16:43.203
UH, I GUESS SO.
I DIDN'T GET A GOOD LOOK.

16:43.203 --> 16:44.474
SAY GOOD THINGS.

16:44.474 --> 16:45.705
WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE
THE INFORMATION

16:45.705 --> 16:47.207
AND YOU'RE TALKING
TO THE MOTHER OF A NEWBORN,

16:47.207 --> 16:48.778
YOU SAY GOOD THINGS.

16:48.778 --> 16:50.410
'CAUSE NINE OUT OF TEN TIMES,
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN--

16:50.410 --> 16:51.641
THE GOOD THINGS.

16:51.641 --> 16:53.443
WHAT ARE YOU TEACHING
THESE GUYS ANYWAY, DR. GREY?

16:53.443 --> 16:54.744
I KNOW, RIGHT?
(door opens)

16:54.744 --> 16:56.446
DR. RYAN,
IT'S AN EMERGENCY.

16:56.446 --> 16:58.488
I'VE GOT A MOM
WITH A PLACENTAL ABRUPTION.

16:58.488 --> 17:00.790
OKAY, MEREDITH,
I'VE CLOSED YOUR UTERUS,

17:00.790 --> 17:02.792
AND I JUST STARTED
TO SUTURE YOUR INCISIONS.

17:02.792 --> 17:04.354
DO YOU TRUST THESE GUYS
TO FINISH?

17:04.354 --> 17:05.655
HAVE YOU TAUGHT THEM
THAT MUCH?
I'LL DO IT.

17:05.655 --> 17:07.497
NO, YOU STOLE NEURO.
YOU'RE NOT STEALING THIS.

17:07.497 --> 17:08.728
THIS IS MY SURGERY,
MY PATIENT,

17:08.728 --> 17:10.760
MY INCISION, MINE.

17:10.760 --> 17:13.363
DR. GREY, I'M SORRY.
THAT WAS INAPPROPRIATE.

17:13.363 --> 17:14.664
IT'S OKAY, ROSS.
I LIKE THE ENTHUSIASM.

17:14.664 --> 17:16.366
GO SCRUB.
THANK YOU.

17:16.366 --> 17:17.537
THANKS, CONNIE.

17:17.537 --> 17:18.738
GOOD LUCK, MOMMY.
CONGRATS.

17:18.738 --> 17:20.270
(door hisses open)
(exhales)

17:20.270 --> 17:21.411
(Cristina) MORE LIGHT.

17:21.411 --> 17:23.473
UH, TO YOUR LEFT.

17:23.473 --> 17:26.776
(exhales deeply)
I CAN'T FIND THE SOURCE.

17:26.776 --> 17:29.479
EVERYTHING I LOOK AT
TURNS OUT TO BE A SHADOW.

17:29.479 --> 17:31.121
I-I COULD KILL HIM
IF I DO THIS.

17:31.121 --> 17:32.752
WELL, YOU'LL CERTAINLY
KILL HIM IF YOU DON'T.

17:32.752 --> 17:34.754
WILL YOU STOP SAYING THAT?
IT'S NOT HELPING. I CAN'T SEE.

17:34.754 --> 17:36.756
THEN DON'T LOOK.

17:36.756 --> 17:38.328
EVERYONE,
TURN OUT YOUR LIGHTS.

17:38.328 --> 17:39.589
UH, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I'M SORRY. WHAT?

17:39.589 --> 17:41.060
SHH. YANG.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.463
LISTEN FOR IT.

17:43.463 --> 17:46.166
YOU KNOW WHAT
A HEALTHY HEART SOUNDS LIKE.

17:46.166 --> 17:50.470
LISTEN AND TELL ME
WHERE THE PROBLEM IS.

17:50.470 --> 17:52.502
NOW, EVERYONE,

17:52.502 --> 17:54.144
LIGHTS OUT

17:54.144 --> 17:56.246
AND QUIET.

17:56.246 --> 17:58.077
(switches click)

17:58.077 --> 17:59.479
(clicks)

18:01.751 --> 18:03.653
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

18:03.653 --> 18:05.115
(exhales)

18:08.558 --> 18:11.221
(squishing)

18:11.221 --> 18:12.762
IT'S...

18:14.264 --> 18:15.425
(squishes)

18:15.425 --> 18:16.596
WAIT.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.128
I THINK IT'S...

18:18.128 --> 18:20.170
(squishes)

18:20.170 --> 18:21.801
IT'S HERE.

18:21.801 --> 18:23.533
I GOT IT.

18:23.533 --> 18:25.535
I GOT IT.
I HAVE MY FINGER ON THE LEAK.

18:25.535 --> 18:28.107
IT'S VENTRICULAR.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.340
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

18:30.340 --> 18:32.111
LIGHTS, PLEASE.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.583
(switches click)

18:33.583 --> 18:36.186
(thunder rumbling)

18:36.186 --> 18:37.547
(instruments clink)

18:37.547 --> 18:39.419
IF THE VENTILATORS
STOP WORKING,

18:39.419 --> 18:42.121
THEN THESE BABIES DIE
UNLESS WE MANUALLY BAG THEM.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.823
CRYSTAL'S BATTERY LIGHT
HAS BEEN ON A WHILE,

18:43.823 --> 18:45.425
SO WHEN IT DIES,

18:45.425 --> 18:47.597
YOU SWITCH HER BABY
OVER TO MANUAL VENTILATION

18:47.597 --> 18:49.299
CALMLY AND QUIETLY.

18:49.299 --> 18:50.600
YOU GUYS, GO CHECK ON
THE OTHER BABIES.
(door hisses open)

18:50.600 --> 18:51.831
DR. SHEPHERD?

18:51.831 --> 18:53.533
(Derek) HIS SATs ARE LOW,
EVEN WITH OXYGEN.

18:53.533 --> 18:55.165
I THINK HE NEEDS C-PAP.
(Alex) THIS YOURS?

18:55.165 --> 18:56.336
YEAH.
CONGRATS, MAN.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT HIM.

18:56.336 --> 18:57.507
THANK YOU.

18:57.507 --> 18:58.468
(beeps, powers down)

18:58.468 --> 18:59.669
WILSON, GO.

18:59.669 --> 19:01.541
EXCUSE ME.
(clears throat)

19:01.541 --> 19:03.443
HEY, CRYSTAL.

19:03.443 --> 19:05.275
I'M JUST GONNA SWITCH
YOUR LITTLE GIRL

19:05.275 --> 19:08.518
OVER TO A MANUAL VENT, OKAY?

19:08.518 --> 19:10.250
OH, WOW. LOOK AT HER.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.582
I THINK SHE'S GROWN
SINCE YESTERDAY.

19:12.582 --> 19:13.723
(exhales)

19:13.723 --> 19:14.824
FOUND ANOTHER RED LIGHT,

19:14.824 --> 19:15.925
ON THE HITCHENS BABY
IN THE BACK.

19:15.925 --> 19:17.457
THAT MAKES TWO MORE
SO FAR.

19:17.457 --> 19:19.429
THREE. I JUST FOUND ANOTHER ONE,
TOO, BUT IT'S FINE.

19:19.429 --> 19:21.391
I'LL JUST JUMP IN
AND BAG MY BABY WHEN IT'S TIME.

19:21.391 --> 19:22.662
AND DR. EDWARDS
CAN BAG HERS.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.464
WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG
THE POWER'S GONNA BE OFF.

19:24.464 --> 19:25.635
WE COULD BE BAGGING
THESE BABIES ALL NIGHT.

19:25.635 --> 19:27.166
WE'LL BAG ALL NIGHT.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.668
IT'S FINE.
WE CAN DO THIS.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.640
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

19:30.640 --> 19:32.171
THANK YOU.

19:32.171 --> 19:35.505
OKAY, THE IMPORTANT THING
IS THAT WE KEEP CALM

19:35.505 --> 19:37.477
AND WE DON'T ALARM THE PARENTS,
CAUSE THERE'S NO REASON TO--

19:37.477 --> 19:39.609
EXCUSE ME, DR. ROBBINS?
YES, TIM. WHAT IS IT?

19:39.609 --> 19:41.681
THIS RED THING RIGHT HERE,
IS THIS A LOW-BATTERY LIGHT?

19:41.681 --> 19:42.852
(thunderclap)

19:42.852 --> 19:44.754
(parents murmur indistinctly)

19:44.754 --> 19:46.286
(Callie) WHERE ARE HUNT
AND AVERY?

19:46.286 --> 19:47.717
THAT FIRE'S GETTING BIGGER.

19:47.717 --> 19:48.958
WHERE ARE THE PAIN MEDS?

19:48.958 --> 19:50.620
I GOT A PATIENT
IN PAIN OVER HERE.

19:50.620 --> 19:52.692
I-I TRIED TO GET THE MEDS.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.524
THE MACHINE, IT--
IT WON'T OPEN WITHOUT POWER.

19:54.524 --> 19:56.296
I CAN'T GET IT TO OPEN.

19:56.296 --> 19:57.597
ALL RIGHT. NEVER MIND THAT.

19:57.597 --> 19:58.798
I'VE GOT AT LEAST
TWO OPEN FRACTURES

19:58.798 --> 19:59.969
AND SOME NASTY LACERATIONS.

19:59.969 --> 20:01.371
YOU WANT TO JUMP IN OVER THERE?

20:01.371 --> 20:03.202
I... I DON'T, UH...

20:03.202 --> 20:04.474
(indistinct conversations)

20:04.474 --> 20:06.506
UH, YOU NEED MEDS.

20:06.506 --> 20:09.279
I'LL FIGURE OUT THE MEDS.
MURPHY.

20:09.279 --> 20:11.481
(man coughing)

20:11.481 --> 20:12.712
(indistinct conversations
continue)

20:12.712 --> 20:13.943
(Jackson) SMELL THAT?
THERE'S GAS EVERYWHERE.

20:13.943 --> 20:15.515
I HAVE A DAUGHTER.
SHE'S 3.

20:15.515 --> 20:17.817
HAVE--HAVE YOU SEEN HER?
IS SHE OKAY?

20:17.817 --> 20:19.619
ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA
HAVE TO WRAP THIS ARM

20:19.619 --> 20:20.850
TO STOP THE BLEEDING.

20:20.850 --> 20:22.622
NO, NO, SHE'S WEARING
PINK HIGH-TOPS.

20:22.622 --> 20:24.494
HER NAME IS EVELYN.
I CALL HER EVIE.

20:24.494 --> 20:26.596
EVERYONE'S INSIDE, MA'AM.
I'M SURE THAT SHE'S THERE.

20:26.596 --> 20:27.757
IF WE CAN MOVE THIS THING
EVEN AN INCH,

20:27.757 --> 20:29.459
I THINK WE CAN
GET HER OUT OF HERE.

20:29.459 --> 20:31.631
LET'S DO IT FAST.

20:31.631 --> 20:33.633
AH!
OH! AAH!

20:33.633 --> 20:34.604
(groans)
AH! AAH!

20:34.604 --> 20:36.566
NEED SOME MORE LIGHT
OVER HERE.

20:36.566 --> 20:38.408
(suction gurgling)

20:38.408 --> 20:40.009
ROSS, WHAT IS TAKING
SO LONG?

20:40.009 --> 20:41.641
IT'S FINE. IT'S JUST--

20:41.641 --> 20:42.912
IT WON'T STOP BLEEDING.

20:42.912 --> 20:45.545
OOH. OH, GOD. THAT'S--

20:45.545 --> 20:46.946
THAT'S A LOT OF BLOOD.

20:46.946 --> 20:48.448
(Meredith) HOW MUCH BLOOD?

20:48.448 --> 20:49.949
I DON'T KNOW. IT'S NOT
COMING FROM YOUR UTERUS.

20:49.949 --> 20:51.581
(gurgling continues)

20:51.581 --> 20:55.355
BROOKS, SHINE A LIGHT OVER HERE.
I FEEL SOMETHING ON MY HAND.

20:55.355 --> 20:57.887
THERE'S BLOOD COMING OUT
AROUND OF MY I.V.

20:57.887 --> 20:59.429
I'M IN D.I.C.

20:59.429 --> 21:02.662
I NEED F.F.P., PACKED RED
BLOOD CELLS, AND PLATELETS.

21:02.662 --> 21:04.564
I HAD A FALL.
WHAT?

21:04.564 --> 21:06.466
YESTERDAY,
I-I FELL DOWN THE STAIRS.

21:06.466 --> 21:07.897
I MIGHT HAVE INJURED
SOMETHING IN MY ABDOMEN.

21:07.897 --> 21:09.739
DID YOU FEEL ANY PAIN?
I'VE BEEN IN LABOR.

21:09.739 --> 21:11.441
GO GET HELP, NOW.

21:11.441 --> 21:12.602
ROSS, WE DON'T HAVE TIME.

21:12.602 --> 21:13.743
YOU NEED TO OPEN ME BACK UP

21:13.743 --> 21:15.305
AND FIND THE SOURCE
OF THIS BLEED.

21:15.305 --> 21:16.546
I CAN'T. I'VE NEVER--

21:16.546 --> 21:18.978
SHANE, IT'S A BASIC
MIDLINE LAPAROTOMY.

21:18.978 --> 21:20.750
PACK THE FOUR QUADRANTS.

21:20.750 --> 21:22.752
FIND THE SOURCE OF THE BLEED.
(suction hissing)

21:22.752 --> 21:24.283
DO NOT LET ME BLEED OUT
ON THIS TABLE.

21:24.283 --> 21:25.585
DR. GREY--
SHANE, DO IT,

21:25.585 --> 21:27.286
RIGHT NOW.

21:27.286 --> 21:30.620
(thunder rumbling)

21:30.620 --> 21:33.393
(monitor beeps rhythmically)

21:38.568 --> 21:39.729
GOOD. GOOD. IT'S MOVING.
(moaning)

21:39.729 --> 21:40.700
PULL HER OUT.
PULL HER OUT.

21:40.700 --> 21:42.372
ALL RIGHT, GO, GO.
I GOT HER.

21:42.372 --> 21:44.474
AH.
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GONNA
WALK YOU OUT THROUGH THE DOOR.

21:44.474 --> 21:46.676
WE'RE GONNA--
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO WALK--
NO, NO, NO, NO.
MY LEG, MY LEG. I CAN'T.

21:46.676 --> 21:48.738
(panting)

21:55.415 --> 21:56.686
MA'AM...

21:56.686 --> 21:58.588
I'M GONNA NEED YOU TO COVER
YOUR EYES, ALL RIGHT?

21:58.588 --> 22:00.750
(whimpers)
READY? HERE WE GO.

22:00.750 --> 22:02.822
AAH!
STAY DOWN.

22:02.822 --> 22:04.854
ALL RIGHT.
(rod clatters on floor)

22:04.854 --> 22:06.896
(parents all talking at once)

22:06.896 --> 22:10.660
(man) THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
SO YOU'RE SAYING YOU DON'T
HAVE ANY EXTRA BATTERIES?

22:10.660 --> 22:12.362
MANUAL VENTILATION
IS JUST AS EFFECTIVE--

22:12.362 --> 22:13.603
MY MONITOR JUST WENT BLACK.
I'M ON IT.

22:13.603 --> 22:15.465
MY BABY CAN'T DIE.
IS MY BABY GONNA DIE?

22:15.465 --> 22:16.606
(monitor beeps)
MINE'S OUT, TOO.

22:16.606 --> 22:17.907
ALL RIGHT.
I'M ON MY WAY.

22:17.907 --> 22:19.569
SEE? WE'RE HANDLING IT.
EVERYTHING IS UNDER CONTROL.

22:19.569 --> 22:20.870
UNDER CONTROL? DO THE MATH.

22:20.870 --> 22:23.743
YOU HAVE DOCTORS ON FOUR
DIFFERENT BABIES RIGHT NOW.

22:23.743 --> 22:25.044
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE LEFT.

22:25.044 --> 22:26.946
YOU'RE TELLING ME YOU CAN
VENTILATE A DOZEN BABIES

22:26.946 --> 22:28.718
ALL BY YOURSELF?
(parents all talking at once)

22:28.718 --> 22:31.581
OKAY, OKAY--
THIS IS NOT OKAY!

22:31.581 --> 22:33.653
(parents continue
all shouting at once)

22:33.653 --> 22:35.124
EVERYBODY.

22:35.124 --> 22:36.486
EVERYBODY, SHUT UP!

22:36.486 --> 22:38.127
(monitors beeping rhythmically)

22:38.127 --> 22:39.589
YOU'RE RIGHT.
THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH DOCTORS

22:39.589 --> 22:41.561
IN THIS ROOM
TO VENTILATE EVERY BABY.

22:41.561 --> 22:43.593
BUT THERE ARE ENOUGH PEOPLE.

22:43.593 --> 22:45.565
HE'S RIGHT.
WE CAN TEACH YOU.

22:45.565 --> 22:47.567
YOU WANT US TO BAG
OUR OWN BABIES?

22:47.567 --> 22:48.898
ACTUALLY, IT'S PRETTY EASY.

22:48.898 --> 22:50.600
I LEARNED HOW TO DO IT
MY FIRST DAY IN MED SCHOOL.

22:50.600 --> 22:51.871
I'LL SHOW YOU.

22:51.871 --> 22:54.744
YOU JUST TAKE THE BAG
WITH YOUR DOMINANT HAND,

22:54.744 --> 22:57.547
GIVE A GOOD, HARD SQUEEZE
EVERY SECOND.

22:57.547 --> 22:58.878
SO ONE ONE THOUSAND,

22:58.878 --> 23:00.379
TWO ONE THOUSAND,

23:00.379 --> 23:01.751
THREE ONE THOUSAND.

23:01.751 --> 23:02.812
YOU WANT TO TRY?

23:02.812 --> 23:04.113
NOT REALLY.

23:04.113 --> 23:05.715
NO, YOU'LL BE FINE.
I'LL BE RIGHT HERE.

23:05.715 --> 23:07.487
COME ON.

23:07.487 --> 23:08.688
(beeping continues)

23:08.688 --> 23:09.989
(Crystal) ONE ONE THOUSAND,

23:09.989 --> 23:11.160
TWO ONE THOUSAND...

23:11.160 --> 23:13.663
THAT'S GREAT.
THAT'S GREAT.

23:13.663 --> 23:14.764
(chuckles)

23:14.764 --> 23:16.466
OH.
(yawns)

23:16.466 --> 23:18.998
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE
JUST FINE.

23:18.998 --> 23:20.900
MM-HMM.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.171
(coos)

23:22.171 --> 23:23.873
MM.

23:23.873 --> 23:26.035
(Shane) IT LOOKS LIKE THE SPLEEN
IS THE SOURCE OF THE BLEEDING.

23:26.035 --> 23:28.007
OKAY, SO MOBILIZE
THE SPLEEN,

23:28.007 --> 23:30.880
DIVIDE IT BY
ITS LIGAMENTOUS ATTACHMENTS--

23:30.880 --> 23:32.111
I CAN'T.
I'VE NEVER DONE IT.

23:32.111 --> 23:33.883
YOU CAN.
YOU'VE SEEN ME DO IT.

23:33.883 --> 23:36.145
MOBILIZE, ASSESS THE INJURY,

23:36.145 --> 23:38.117
AND STOP THE HEMORRHAGE.

23:38.117 --> 23:39.649
OKAY.

23:39.649 --> 23:40.820
OKAY.

23:40.820 --> 23:42.452
I NEED METZ

23:42.452 --> 23:43.953
AND LAP PADS, PLEASE.

23:43.953 --> 23:45.655
AND FOLLOW ME
WITH SUCTION.

23:45.655 --> 23:46.796
THAT'S RIGHT, ROSS.

23:46.796 --> 23:49.699
THAT'S IT. YOU GOT THIS.
THIS IS YOUR O.R.

23:49.699 --> 23:51.531
YOU DON'T NEED MY HELP.
YES, I DO.

23:51.531 --> 23:52.762
NO, YOU DON'T,

23:52.762 --> 23:53.903
BECAUSE I'M GONNA
LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS

23:53.903 --> 23:55.665
IN A FEW SECONDS.

23:55.665 --> 23:57.136
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE
ON YOUR OWN.

23:57.136 --> 23:58.808
AND YOU'RE NOT
GONNA FREAK OUT.

23:58.808 --> 24:01.711
AND, SHANE, IF I ARREST
FOR MORE THAN NINE MINUTES,

24:01.711 --> 24:03.142
LET ME GO.

24:03.142 --> 24:06.215
DON'T REVIVE ME.
I DO NOT WANT TO BE A VEGETABLE.

24:06.215 --> 24:08.748
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

24:08.748 --> 24:11.621
SHANE,
I NEED YOU TO RESPOND.

24:11.621 --> 24:14.724
I NEED TO KNOW
YOU UNDERSTAND ME.

24:14.724 --> 24:16.125
(thunder rumbling)

24:16.125 --> 24:19.188
DR. ROSS, YOUR...

24:19.188 --> 24:21.230
SUPERIOR

24:21.230 --> 24:24.594
IS ASKING YOU TO RESPOND--

24:24.594 --> 24:25.895
YES, DR. GREY.

24:25.895 --> 24:27.497
ROSS, YOU CAN--

24:27.497 --> 24:28.868
YOU CAN DO THIS.

24:28.868 --> 24:31.040
AND T--

24:31.040 --> 24:32.902
TELL DEREK...

24:32.902 --> 24:34.944
I KNOW

24:34.944 --> 24:37.046
THE BABY'S NAME.

24:37.046 --> 24:39.078
(gas hissing)

24:39.078 --> 24:41.150
IT'S...

24:41.150 --> 24:44.113
(hissing continues)

24:44.113 --> 24:46.686
(Richard) YOU OKAY?

24:46.686 --> 24:47.817
(thunderclap)

24:47.817 --> 24:49.589
THAT WAS...

24:49.589 --> 24:51.991
(thunder rumbling)

24:51.991 --> 24:54.163
YOU MADE ME
A BETTER DOCTOR TONIGHT,

24:54.163 --> 24:55.725
DR. WEBBER.

24:55.725 --> 24:57.126
(surgical staff
speaking indistinctly)

24:57.126 --> 24:58.768
THANK YOU.

25:00.770 --> 25:02.902
YOU'RE WELCOME.

25:05.204 --> 25:07.637
I'M GONNA GO
CHECK ON MEREDITH,

25:07.637 --> 25:09.138
SEE IF WE HAVE
A BABY YET.

25:09.138 --> 25:10.680
GREY'S HAVING HER BABY?
MM-HMM.

25:10.680 --> 25:11.911
WELL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

25:14.784 --> 25:17.647
WELL, I OUGHTA SEE
WHAT'S HOLDING UP FRANK.

25:21.821 --> 25:23.252
NOW I SEE WHAT SHE MEANS--

25:23.252 --> 25:25.655
MIRANDA--
WHEN SHE TALKS ABOUT YOU.

25:25.655 --> 25:27.927
SHE SAYS THAT YOU CAN, UH,

25:27.927 --> 25:31.901
PULL GREATNESS
RIGHT OUT OF PEOPLE.

25:34.904 --> 25:38.808
I WASN'T ABLE TO PULL IT
OUT OF HER, APPARENTLY.

25:38.808 --> 25:40.710
(thunder rumbling)

25:40.710 --> 25:42.712
IT'S NOT WORKING.
IT'S JAMMED.

25:42.712 --> 25:45.014
"IN CASE OF EMERGENCY,
USE THE KEY."

25:45.014 --> 25:47.276
A BUS CRASHED.
THIS IS AN EMERGENCY.

25:47.276 --> 25:49.649
WE ARE USING THE DAMN KEY.
HERE.

25:49.649 --> 25:51.821
DR. BAILEY,
CAN YOU HELP?

25:51.821 --> 25:54.153
IT'S DR. GREY. SHE'S IN SURGERY,
AND SHE'S IN BAD SHAPE.

25:54.153 --> 25:56.726
DR. GREY IS VERY CAPABLE.
SHE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

25:56.726 --> 25:59.228
SHE'S NOT OPERATING.
SHE'S THE ONE ON THE TABLE.

25:59.228 --> 26:01.090
(jangles keys)

26:01.090 --> 26:04.794
(thunder rumbling)

26:09.038 --> 26:12.842

26:20.209 --> 26:21.681
(Miranda grunts)

26:21.681 --> 26:24.053
(thuds, shatters)

26:24.053 --> 26:26.185
UGH! UGH!

26:26.185 --> 26:27.717
DR. BAILEY!

26:29.058 --> 26:30.690
AAH!

26:30.690 --> 26:31.861

26:31.861 --> 26:35.064

26:39.699 --> 26:40.930

MM.

26:46.035 --> 26:47.977
(pants)

26:47.977 --> 26:50.640
DON'T JUST STAND THERE.
GET THE MEDS.

26:50.640 --> 26:53.082
(panting)

26:53.082 --> 26:55.384
LET'S GO.

26:57.086 --> 26:58.988
(Owen) MOVE FAST. THIS THING'S
A TICKING TIME BOMB!

26:58.988 --> 27:00.690
COME ON. COME ON. COME ON.
COME ON.

27:00.690 --> 27:01.821
ALMOST THERE. DONE.

27:01.821 --> 27:02.992

27:02.992 --> 27:05.755

27:05.755 --> 27:07.126

27:07.126 --> 27:09.328
START A LARGE-BORE I.V.
WHERE'S JACKSON?

27:09.328 --> 27:11.000

NO, HE'S NOT.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.963

27:13.963 --> 27:15.705
HEY.

27:15.705 --> 27:17.767

27:17.767 --> 27:18.968
(indistinct conversations
continue)

27:18.968 --> 27:21.911
I LIKE YOUR SHOES, EVIE.
THOSE ARE REALLY COOL.

27:21.911 --> 27:23.412
BET YOU CAN RUN
PRETTY FAST IN THOSE, HUH?

27:23.412 --> 27:27.076
HEY, YOU WANT TO RACE?
I BET I COULD BEAT YOU.

27:27.076 --> 27:29.819
COME ON. JUST GRAB MY HAND.
WE CAN GO RIGHT NOW.

27:29.819 --> 27:31.921
COME ON.
HERE, TAKE MY HAND.

I'VE MOBILIZED HER SPLEEN.

27:53.172 --> 27:54.904
(gloves snap)
I CONSIDERED SPLENIC SALVAGE,

27:54.904 --> 27:56.445
BUT I CAN'T CONTROL
THE BLEEDING.

27:56.445 --> 27:57.747
I DID EVERYTHING SHE SAID.

31:27.616 --> 31:28.988
DID YOU SEE HIM?

31:28.988 --> 31:31.260
UH, NO. I DIDN'T.

31:31.260 --> 31:34.223
YEAH, HE LOOKS LIKE HER.

31:34.223 --> 31:35.364

31:38.067 --> 31:39.969

31:39.969 --> 31:43.933

31:52.481 --> 31:59.648
HEY, MEREDITH GREY HAS SURVIVED
A BOMB, A DROWNING, A GUNMAN,

31:59.648 --> 32:01.920

32:01.920 --> 32:04.293
SHE'S GONNA DIE
WHEN SHE'S, LIKE, 90,

32:04.293 --> 32:06.655
OLD AND WARM IN HER BED.
(huffs)

32:06.655 --> 32:09.358

32:09.358 --> 32:13.002

32:13.002 --> 32:16.165

HEY.

32:32.551 --> 32:37.626

32:37.626 --> 32:39.258
I-I REMOVED IT,

32:39.258 --> 32:41.390
BUT... (sniffles)

32:41.390 --> 32:42.961

32:49.468 --> 32:50.969

32:50.969 --> 32:52.401
WITH AN ASSIST FROM DR. ROSS.

32:52.401 --> 32:54.643
BAILEY DECIDED,
WITH THE POWER OUT,

32:54.643 --> 32:56.245
IT'S SAFEST JUST TO KEEP HER

33:55.704 --> 33:58.507
I HAVE TO BELIEVE IT'S 'CAUSE
SHE HAD A GREAT TEACHER.

33:58.507 --> 34:01.370
YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE

34:01.370 --> 34:04.513
FOR MAKING YOUR LADIES CRAZY
OR GIVING 'EM CANCER,

34:04.513 --> 34:05.674

MAKE 'EM GREAT.

34:16.385 --> 34:18.657

34:18.657 --> 34:19.728

34:19.728 --> 34:22.531

35:35.434 --> 35:38.667
I THINK IT RUINED
YOUR ENTIRE LIVING ROOM.

35:40.839 --> 35:42.741
LISTEN, I HAVE TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING.
NO, YOU DON'T.

35:42.741 --> 35:44.173

WHAT I'M GONNA SAY.

35:44.173 --> 35:46.175
I THINK I DO,
AND YOU SHOULDN'T.

35:46.175 --> 35:48.247

MESS THAT UP.

35:56.154 --> 35:57.586
YOU WON'T MESS
ANYTHING UP.

35:57.586 --> 36:02.291
LAST NIGHT, BEFORE THE TREE,
YOU ASKED ME A QUESTION.

36:02.291 --> 36:04.293
YOU WANTED TO HEAR ME
SAY THE WORDS.

36:04.293 --> 36:06.435
SO I'M...

36:06.435 --> 36:09.438

(chuckles)

36:13.602 --> 36:14.703
