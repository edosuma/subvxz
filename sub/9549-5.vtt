00:05.812 --> 00:07.002
Here's what happened.

00:07.207 --> 00:11.119
{\pos(192,230)}You were in the middle of a very messy,
very expensive divorce,

00:11.369 --> 00:13.293
{\pos(192,230)}and you wanted to get rid of your wife.

00:13.650 --> 00:16.258
That is absurd.
Do I have to listen to this?

00:16.321 --> 00:19.684
- Yes, you do.
- What you needed was an alibi.

00:20.313 --> 00:22.664
<i>First, you ordered
a two-ton slab of marble.</i>

00:22.883 --> 00:26.247
<i>Then you went to work, but you
weren't sculpting just another statue.</i>

00:26.490 --> 00:29.884
<i>You were sculpting an alibi,
a perfect alibi.</i>

00:29.947 --> 00:32.546
<i>You had it all worked out,</i>
down to the last

00:32.665 --> 00:35.235
- details
- Hold it! Don't say another word.

00:35.450 --> 00:37.802
Excuse me,
sir, this is a private conversation.

00:37.865 --> 00:40.424
Yeah, this conversation's over,
unless you want to talk to me,

00:40.487 --> 00:42.666
but I cannot promise
that I would listen, detective.

00:42.752 --> 00:44.554
- And you are?
- I'm Harrison Powell.

00:44.617 --> 00:47.240
I'm Mr. Gildea's Attorney.
I just moved up from Los Angeles.

00:47.303 --> 00:49.778
And you must be Mr. Adrian Monk.

00:50.120 --> 00:52.695
I saw your profile on in Focus.
Very impressive.

00:52.826 --> 00:54.776
Thank you.
I was just explaing to...

00:54.839 --> 00:58.220
Why don't you tell it to the judge?
We're denying everything categorically.

00:58.297 --> 01:01.518
Have a nice day. Come on. Let's go. You
look like a man who could use a drink.

01:02.096 --> 01:04.848
Evan, let's go.
They can't keep you here. It's okay.

01:07.815 --> 01:09.030
Harrison, it's too late.

01:09.093 --> 01:11.468
They know everything.
They have all this evidence against me.

01:11.531 --> 01:13.744
No, they have no evidence against you.
They have nothing,

01:13.807 --> 01:16.087
Okay? You're an innocent man
that's been unjustly accused.

01:16.150 --> 01:18.335
And I'm gonna prove all
that when we get to court.

01:18.398 --> 01:21.652
Harrison, it's Adrian Monk.
He's never lost a case in his life.

01:21.718 --> 01:23.841
Well, neither have i.
This'll be great.

02:32.146 --> 02:34.857
{\pos(192,40)}And in this corner district
attorney Charles Friedkin.

02:35.132 --> 02:36.388
How you feeling, champ?

02:36.476 --> 02:38.573
Are you guys ready?
Did you all do your homework?

02:38.661 --> 02:41.173
{\pos(192,230)}Charlie, relax,
we've testified at 100 trials.

02:41.237 --> 02:43.868
- 112.
- Well, I'm just making sure.

02:44.288 --> 02:47.807
{\pos(192,220)}Now did everyone review the grand jury
transcripts and the follow-up reports?

02:47.981 --> 02:50.800
Mr. Friedkin, don't worry.
They can do this in their sleep.

02:51.732 --> 02:54.629
{\pos(192,50)}In fact, on at least two occasions,
Lt. Disher has.

02:54.714 --> 02:56.482
{\pos(192,20)}Well, nobody's sleeping today.

02:56.561 --> 03:00.565
{\pos(192,40)}Harrison powell is the prince of
darkness, so be careful up there.

03:00.787 --> 03:02.135
Don't volunteer anything.

03:02.210 --> 03:04.509
If you don't rember something,
just say you don't rember.

03:04.572 --> 03:06.722
- He's guilty, right?
- So was OJ.

03:06.826 --> 03:08.318
Hey, speak of the devil.

03:08.922 --> 03:11.289
Devil appears.
Gentlemen. Ms. Teeger.

03:11.898 --> 03:13.564
Mr. Gildea, that's a nice suit.

03:13.627 --> 03:15.309
I wonder how you'll look in pinstripes.

03:15.372 --> 03:18.303
Harrison, my offer's still on the table.
This is your last chance.

03:18.366 --> 03:20.864
Here's my final offer to you.
You drop the case,

03:20.927 --> 03:24.206
make a public apology to my client,
you save the taxpayers a lot of money.

03:24.269 --> 03:25.790
I'm offering you a gift, Charlie.

03:25.853 --> 03:28.880
You can keep the police from
looking like chimpanzees with guns.

03:29.947 --> 03:32.819
Okay, I'll see you all inside.
Under oath this time.

03:35.713 --> 03:38.704
- And I hate you.
- "Chimpanzees with guns."

03:39.448 --> 03:42.060
{\pos(192,40)}- Charlie, don't sweat it.
- He's all talk.

03:43.436 --> 03:44.834
Captain Stottlemeyer,

03:44.897 --> 03:48.709
{\pos(192,40)}could you describe the events
of october 2 for the jury?

03:49.119 --> 03:51.477
{\pos(192,40)}Yes, sir.
Approximately at 8:00 am.

03:51.540 --> 03:54.195
{\pos(192,40)}My team and I responded to a

03:54.258 --> 03:56.751
{\pos(192,40)}suspicious death call
at 104 Pickens drive.

03:57.114 --> 03:59.036
The housekeeper had discovered the body.

03:59.520 --> 04:00.530
Who had died?

04:01.589 --> 04:02.791
Nancy Gildea.

04:02.854 --> 04:05.964
{\pos(192,40)}Nancy Gildea.
I was just reading about her.

04:06.027 --> 04:08.438
{\pos(192,40)}- She was married to that famous artist.
- Evan Gildea.

04:08.501 --> 04:12.273
{\pos(192,40)}They were separated. Very separated.
I guess these are some of his.

04:12.844 --> 04:15.943
This is amazing.
Look at that. It's perfect.

04:16.509 --> 04:19.990
Mr. Monk, that's a display stand.
The art is out here.

04:20.555 --> 04:22.234
Well, that's junk.

04:22.393 --> 04:24.892
{\pos(192,40)}Well, the M.E Says she's
been dead about 12 hours.

04:25.386 --> 04:27.550
{\pos(192,20)}So that's about 8:00 last night.

04:27.881 --> 04:30.690
{\pos(192,40)}Yes, sir.
Looks like a straight-up break-in.

04:31.470 --> 04:33.472
{\pos(192,20)}Punches a hole through this window.

04:33.622 --> 04:35.563
Opens the door from the inside.

04:36.046 --> 04:39.911
{\pos(192,40)}She wakes up. They fight. He takes
that statue from here hits her once.

04:39.974 --> 04:42.523
So, base of the skull.
Medulla Oblongata.

04:42.926 --> 04:45.770
{\pos(192,40)}- Killed her instantly.
- I don't think so.

04:46.664 --> 04:48.283
That hole's pretty small.

04:48.600 --> 04:51.346
{\pos(192,40)}I don't think anyone could
fit their hand through there.

04:51.666 --> 04:52.700
Sure they could.

04:52.763 --> 04:55.075
And did you determine
whether Monk was right?

04:55.357 --> 04:56.357
Yes, sir.

04:57.372 --> 04:59.791
{\pos(192,40)}Lt. Disher ran a field test
to be certain.

05:04.630 --> 05:05.649
Excuse me.

05:05.890 --> 05:07.357
I'm sorry to interrupt.

05:07.987 --> 05:11.419
{\pos(192,40)}I saw Lt. Disher
in the hall before the trial.

05:11.498 --> 05:14.884
{\pos(192,40)}I couldn't help but notice both
of his hands were bandaged.

05:15.024 --> 05:16.053
Yes, ma'am.

05:17.108 --> 05:19.906
{\pos(192,40)}He wanted to be sure,
so he tried it again with the other arm.

05:20.130 --> 05:21.945
He tried it again?

05:22.500 --> 05:23.669
He's very thorough.

05:28.404 --> 05:29.510
I'm sorry.

05:35.300 --> 05:38.185
{\pos(192,40)}- Oh, my god.
- I can't help it.

05:38.301 --> 05:41.140
{\pos(192,40)}- Drink some water.
- I tried. It's not working.

05:41.203 --> 05:42.558
{\pos(192,40)}Maybe if you scared me.

05:43.720 --> 05:46.704
If you hiccup again, i'm gonna
take Randy's gun and shoot you.

05:50.554 --> 05:52.628
- That worked.
- You're welcome.

05:56.743 --> 05:58.434
No wait.
Rudy?

06:01.297 --> 06:03.804
Hey, this is Rudy Smith
from the big buddy program.

06:03.906 --> 06:05.554
I used to be his mentor.

06:05.897 --> 06:07.327
Hey, man, how you doing?

06:07.544 --> 06:09.347
I was just thinking about you.

06:09.738 --> 06:12.760
This kid was trouble with
a capital T Back in the day.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.707
- Hey, rember how we met?
- He caught me spray-painting.

06:15.833 --> 06:18.411
Yeah, I caught him
spray-painting police cars.

06:18.775 --> 06:21.026
Made him work it off five
days a week for a month?

06:21.271 --> 06:22.677
A little bit of tough love.

06:23.794 --> 06:25.001
What you doing here?

06:25.082 --> 06:27.761
You a lawyer now?
A little doogie howser thing going on?

06:28.115 --> 06:30.382
Smith, let's go.
Van's downstairs.

06:36.383 --> 06:37.383
Let's go.

06:39.781 --> 06:41.571
Wait.
Detective.

06:41.872 --> 06:43.121
Hey wait.
Detective.

06:44.295 --> 06:45.252
What did he do?

06:45.315 --> 06:47.949
He robbed a store and killed the Clerk.
Murder one.

06:49.074 --> 06:50.144
Let's go.

06:54.590 --> 06:56.847
Captain, when did you first suspect

06:56.968 --> 07:00.198
Evan Ggildea was responsible
for his wife's murder?

07:00.320 --> 07:03.473
Well, actually that was
Adrian Monk. See,

07:04.296 --> 07:06.974
Monk was looking around at the art
at the victim's house,

07:07.037 --> 07:08.912
and he noticed something.

07:10.716 --> 07:12.902
- He hit her with this?
- Apparently.

07:14.827 --> 07:16.392
Why didn't he use this one?

07:16.586 --> 07:18.701
The fight started here.

07:20.241 --> 07:21.671
I would have grabbed this.

07:23.138 --> 07:24.428
It's heavy enough.

07:25.064 --> 07:26.569
It would have been perfect.

07:28.251 --> 07:30.526
Instead he crossed all
the way over there.

07:32.251 --> 07:33.160
E.G.

07:33.459 --> 07:34.528
Evan Gildea.

07:36.787 --> 07:39.392
So Monk figured that Mr. Gildea,

07:39.560 --> 07:42.360
not wanting to destroy
one of his own pieces of art,

07:42.423 --> 07:43.736
grabbed the other statue.

07:43.799 --> 07:46.324
And that's when you began
to Focus on the defendant.

07:46.446 --> 07:47.789
Yes, sir, that's correct.

07:48.179 --> 07:49.993
- Thank you, captain.
- You're welcome.

07:50.361 --> 07:51.514
Your witness.

07:54.883 --> 07:57.024
That's a great story,
captain Stottlemeyer.

07:57.087 --> 07:59.548
I won't take up too much of your time.
I just have a few questions.

07:59.611 --> 08:03.105
Your consultant Mr. Monk,
is he a trained psychologist?

08:04.140 --> 08:07.522
No, no, but he's a lot smarter
than any psychologist I've ever met.

08:07.612 --> 08:09.757
Yeah, he would have to be,
having never met my client,

08:09.820 --> 08:13.264
to know that my client would not use one
of his own statues as a murder weapon.

08:13.895 --> 08:15.258
That was just a theory.

08:15.321 --> 08:19.317
A theory that led us to
a substantial amount of other evidence.

08:19.458 --> 08:21.924
Okay, we'll get to that other
evidence a little bit later.

08:21.987 --> 08:24.351
I would like to know, if we could
just back up for a little bit,

08:24.414 --> 08:27.759
how was Mr. Monk able to divine
where the fight started?

08:28.892 --> 08:30.859
- Where the fight started?
- Where it started.

08:30.970 --> 08:34.491
How did he know, for example, the fight
did not start in, say, the foyer?

08:39.128 --> 08:40.602
I'll have to consult my notes.

08:40.688 --> 08:43.058
Were you there when the fight started,
captain Stottlemeyer?

08:45.192 --> 08:48.309
Was your friend Adrian Monk there when
the fight started, captain Stottlemeyer?

08:49.659 --> 08:50.778
No, he was not.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.803
Isn't it possible, captain Stottlemeyer,

08:52.866 --> 08:56.310
isn't it possible the fight
could have started in the foyer?

08:59.069 --> 09:01.021
- Yes, it's po...
- Good job. I think we're done.

09:01.084 --> 09:03.024
Let's move on to something else,
shall we?

09:07.324 --> 09:09.123
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

09:09.186 --> 09:10.243
Not you.

09:11.245 --> 09:12.675
It's just this kid.

09:14.092 --> 09:17.163
- I really thought he turned a corner.
- Well, you said he had problems.

09:17.251 --> 09:18.561
Shoplifting.

09:18.624 --> 09:21.200
Like, a couple of fights,
but nothing like this.

09:22.770 --> 09:25.111
I promised his grandmother
i'd look out for him.

09:25.301 --> 09:26.740
She made me promise.

09:30.571 --> 09:31.653
Hey. How'd it go?

09:33.799 --> 09:34.906
Give me a sec.

09:47.651 --> 09:48.845
You're sweating.

09:49.316 --> 09:51.181
- He's tough.
- Your tie's wet.

09:51.257 --> 09:54.005
- What happened in there?
- He's tough. That's what happened.

09:54.068 --> 09:56.283
He kept coming at me like Muhammad Ali.

09:59.057 --> 10:00.064
You're up.

10:00.795 --> 10:03.734
Monk, be careful in there.
Don't give him any openings.

10:03.896 --> 10:05.667
Leland.
I'm fine.

10:06.317 --> 10:07.934
Evan gildea is the guy.

10:08.114 --> 10:12.118
We both know he's the guy, and in 20
minutes the jury's gonna know it too.

10:21.714 --> 10:25.569
And so I concluded
that Mr. Gildea had the means,

10:26.209 --> 10:27.209
motive,

10:27.533 --> 10:30.213
{\pos(192,40)}and the opportunity
to murder his wife.

10:30.427 --> 10:32.047
{\pos(192,240)}I have no further questions.

10:32.675 --> 10:35.267
{\pos(192,40)}Mr. Monk, on behalf of the people
of San Francisco,

10:35.330 --> 10:37.597
{\pos(192,40)}I want to thank you
for sharing your opinion.

10:37.694 --> 10:38.962
It's not my opinion.

10:39.664 --> 10:40.883
It's what happened.

10:42.030 --> 10:43.162
Your witness.

10:47.782 --> 10:51.078
{\pos(192,40)}Mr. Monk, I too would like to thank
you for a lifetime of service.

10:51.318 --> 10:52.260
You're welcome.

10:52.323 --> 10:55.837
{\pos(192,220)}If you don't mind it won't take too much
time, i'd like to review your testimony.

10:56.279 --> 10:57.884
- What part?
- All of it.

10:58.092 --> 10:59.862
Every syllable
actually.

11:00.025 --> 11:01.131
Let's start with

11:01.194 --> 11:04.337
your trip to Santa Barbara. You said
that happened the day after the murder?

11:04.400 --> 11:06.778
That's correct.
As I said.

11:07.220 --> 11:10.255
We drove down to Mr. Gildea's
studio the next morning.

11:10.318 --> 11:13.338
We spoke to a local police sergeant,
St. Carney.

11:13.681 --> 11:14.984
What have you got Sergeant?

11:15.052 --> 11:17.856
I was here at 9:00 this
morning after you called.

11:18.217 --> 11:20.560
- I told him about his wife.
- How'd he take it?

11:20.820 --> 11:22.250
Seemed pretty shaken up.

11:22.485 --> 11:24.587
What do you mean "seemed"?
Was he faking it?

11:24.810 --> 11:26.688
You tell me.
He's right inside.

11:31.915 --> 11:33.271
Wipes.
Plural.

11:33.532 --> 11:35.359
- Plural wipes. Wipes.
- Okay.

11:35.875 --> 11:38.814
- It's a dust factory in here.
- Mr. Monk, he's a sculptor.

11:38.877 --> 11:40.796
- It's part of his job.
- It's no excuse.

11:40.929 --> 11:42.197
Evan Gildea!

11:46.322 --> 11:49.156
Hello, we're with the San Francisco
police department.

11:49.219 --> 11:50.426
What are you doing here?

11:50.489 --> 11:53.019
Why aren't you out looking for
the son of a bitch that killed my wife?

11:53.082 --> 11:54.820
- We are.
- Who's this?

11:54.894 --> 11:56.956
This is Adrian Monk.
He's consulting with us.

11:57.072 --> 11:59.448
Mr. Gildea,
where were you last night around 9:00?

11:59.560 --> 12:01.508
I was here all night.
I was working.

12:02.117 --> 12:03.211
Were you alone?

12:03.710 --> 12:04.515
No.

12:06.709 --> 12:07.940
I was with her.

12:27.873 --> 12:29.353
Mr. Monk, are you okay?

12:29.968 --> 12:32.629
- I'm fine.
- You were making a noise.

12:33.097 --> 12:34.324
I don't think so.

12:35.031 --> 12:36.645
Could you read that back, please?

12:37.213 --> 12:41.106
The defendant removed
a sheet revealing a naked...

12:53.304 --> 12:54.647
Are you nervous, Mr. Monk?

12:55.403 --> 12:56.634
I'm fine.

12:56.958 --> 12:58.401
You were describing the statue.

12:59.530 --> 13:02.200
I'm not gonna win any husband
of-the-year awards, I admit that,

13:02.278 --> 13:04.031
but I did not kill Nancy.

13:04.293 --> 13:07.596
I never get violent. If I get angry,
I take it out on the stone.

13:08.167 --> 13:09.601
Besides, it's just not possible.

13:09.664 --> 13:12.438
It's not physically possible.
I was here all night.

13:12.845 --> 13:15.841
Ask Sgt. Carney. I was finishing up
when he came in this morning.

13:15.936 --> 13:19.655
Your honor, I would like to introduce
ot the court defense exhibit A.

13:22.144 --> 13:24.760
Is this the statue that you
saw in Mr. Gildea's studio?

13:27.318 --> 13:30.816
The statue is my client alibi. It's kind
of important that you take a look at it.

13:30.879 --> 13:33.848
In fact the statue is the single most
important piece of evidence

13:33.911 --> 13:36.877
in this entire case,
and you can't even look at it.

13:37.182 --> 13:38.472
I got the gist of it.

13:39.042 --> 13:42.250
I'm sorry,
he got the gist of the evidence.

13:43.249 --> 13:45.873
I got
the gist of the head and the...

13:49.725 --> 13:50.725
Upper

13:52.007 --> 13:53.216
head area.

13:56.010 --> 13:58.149
She's your grandmother.
She loves you.

13:59.338 --> 14:02.402
I don't want to see her.
Not now. Not like this.

14:03.655 --> 14:05.123
At least call her, okay?

14:05.948 --> 14:06.948
Look at me.

14:09.442 --> 14:10.657
You gonna call her?

14:14.718 --> 14:16.683
- So how's your lawyer?
- She's okay.

14:18.404 --> 14:19.698
Rudy, what happened?

14:22.346 --> 14:23.428
Was it my fault?

14:23.867 --> 14:26.883
- Your fault?
- Yeah, I was your big buddy.

14:27.601 --> 14:29.497
I was supposed to look out for you.

14:29.600 --> 14:31.829
And I should have said,
"Rudy, don't kill anybody."

14:31.892 --> 14:33.248
I didn't kill anybody.

14:33.761 --> 14:35.788
I talked to the DA.
I know what you did.

14:37.437 --> 14:39.532
I swear.
I messed up.

14:40.716 --> 14:43.901
I went in there,
I robbed the place, I admit it.

14:44.301 --> 14:46.520
I took 30 bucks from the cash register.

14:46.717 --> 14:49.478
I grabbed a gold chain from the lady.
Then I split.

14:50.886 --> 14:52.415
She was alive when I left.

15:02.398 --> 15:04.064
30 bucks from the register.

15:06.300 --> 15:07.606
You grabbed a chain?

15:08.981 --> 15:10.241
You told the cops that?

15:14.712 --> 15:15.894
It's not in here.

15:17.915 --> 15:19.449
Guess you guys aren't perfect.

15:27.811 --> 15:28.942
Look what I found.

15:30.405 --> 15:31.848
Our friendship bracelets.

15:32.847 --> 15:33.966
Put it on.

15:39.651 --> 15:41.317
I remember when we made these.

15:42.887 --> 15:44.168
Remember what we said?

15:45.409 --> 15:46.487
I remember.

15:46.764 --> 15:49.450
We promised each other
we wouldn't lie to each other.

15:51.499 --> 15:53.078
So I'm gonna ask you one time.

15:55.818 --> 15:57.422
Did you kill that woman, Rudy?

16:00.354 --> 16:01.354
I swear.

16:03.340 --> 16:04.468
I didn't do it.

16:23.234 --> 16:25.784
Is there a problem with the microphone?

16:26.038 --> 16:28.811
There is a small kink in the microphone,
your honor.

16:29.207 --> 16:30.612
You'll thank me later.

16:39.427 --> 16:40.456
There it is.

16:43.520 --> 16:44.639
You're welcome.

16:45.769 --> 16:47.491
Mr. Monk, I'm sure you're aware

16:47.634 --> 16:50.842
that in this court we've had not one,
not two, but three

16:51.497 --> 16:54.151
art experts.
They have all examined this sculpture.

16:54.214 --> 16:57.664
They've all agreed it would take at
least 12 hs to sculpt a piece like this.

16:57.736 --> 16:59.987
That's true.
At first

17:00.559 --> 17:03.170
it looked like the perfect alibi.

17:03.971 --> 17:05.564
All right, is that better?

17:06.474 --> 17:07.304
Thank you.

17:07.367 --> 17:09.789
Mr. Gildea,
how do we know when you sculpted this?

17:09.852 --> 17:12.295
- I mean, it could have been last week.
- Or last year.

17:12.512 --> 17:13.769
Here's how you know.

17:16.808 --> 17:18.604
She was carved from a two-ton slab

17:18.666 --> 17:21.840
of Belgian gray marble that was
delivered yesterday at 5:00 pm.

17:22.550 --> 17:23.807
Here's the receipt.

17:23.943 --> 17:25.521
You can call the quarry yourself.

17:26.021 --> 17:30.025
How do we know this
is the same slab of Belgian gray marble?

17:30.897 --> 17:33.581
You could have sculpted the-the-the...

17:35.027 --> 17:37.601
- Nude.
- The nude statue out of

17:38.012 --> 17:39.380
a different slab.

17:39.631 --> 17:43.009
And when that marble was delivered
yesterday, all you had to do

17:43.170 --> 17:44.849
- was hide it.
- Hide it?

17:45.547 --> 17:48.619
You think I hid
a two-ton slab of marble?

17:50.111 --> 17:51.931
That's fantastic.

17:52.438 --> 17:55.343
Where is it, detective?
Is it underneath the couch?

18:30.184 --> 18:33.888
Thank you very much for your time,
Mr. Gildea. Sorry about your wife.

18:34.070 --> 18:36.303
You understand, we always have
to talk to the husband,

18:36.366 --> 18:38.291
especially in a case like this.
Of course.

18:38.354 --> 18:39.361
The clock.

18:40.466 --> 18:42.854
- Excuse me?
- The clock in your studio

18:43.486 --> 18:45.040
was 20 minutes slow.

18:45.589 --> 18:48.797
And that popsicle is half-melted.
Your freezer

18:49.456 --> 18:51.347
must have been off for a while.

18:53.820 --> 18:56.082
- You blew a fuse.
- A fuse?

18:56.971 --> 18:58.190
Wait, you're right.

18:58.582 --> 19:01.285
I remember.
I was plugging in my coffee maker...

19:03.230 --> 19:04.983
No, it wasn't a coffee maker.

19:05.143 --> 19:07.307
You were using something much bigger.

19:07.584 --> 19:09.470
There's a heavy duty
extension cord in there.

19:09.533 --> 19:12.819
It is the only thing in your studio
not covered with dust.

19:13.069 --> 19:16.286
You were using some, some kind of tool.

19:18.370 --> 19:19.576
A Jackhammer.

19:21.063 --> 19:25.067
You killed her, you drove back here this
morning you chopped up all of the marble

19:25.452 --> 19:28.375
with the Jackhammer before
Stg. Carney arrived.

19:28.438 --> 19:30.292
It wouldn't have taken
you more than an hour.

19:30.389 --> 19:31.720
I chopped it all up?

19:31.784 --> 19:34.151
You're in the middle of nowhere.
Nobody would have heard you.

19:34.220 --> 19:37.205
And then what?
Where did I put it? Two tons of marble.

19:37.694 --> 19:39.617
- Maybe I ate it.
- No.

19:40.394 --> 19:41.699
No, you didn't eat it.

19:42.475 --> 19:43.744
We're standing on it.

19:47.661 --> 19:51.068
And he took the two tons of marble,
and he spread it across his driveway?

19:51.232 --> 19:52.190
That's right.

19:52.253 --> 19:54.937
And you're a detective, Mr. Monk.
You're not a science fiction writer?

19:55.070 --> 19:56.959
No, I am not.

19:57.246 --> 19:58.977
- A writer.
- That's too bad.

19:59.097 --> 20:01.372
I think you might have missed
your calling, Mr. Monk.

20:02.595 --> 20:05.048
Objection, your honor.
Argumentative.

20:05.278 --> 20:06.288
Sustained.

20:07.675 --> 20:08.915
Let's bring it in.

20:09.351 --> 20:12.766
Your honor, I would like to introduce
to the court defense exhibit B.

20:12.906 --> 20:16.046
This is a sample of the gravel
taken from my client's driveway.

20:16.154 --> 20:18.551
Now, Mr. Monk,
if what you're saying is correct,

20:18.614 --> 20:21.808
the all of these pieces could have come
from the same slab.

20:21.871 --> 20:24.570
Therefore, they should all fit
together like a giant Jigsaw puzzle.

20:24.645 --> 20:26.199
- Isn't that right?
- In theory.

20:26.262 --> 20:27.107
In theory?

20:27.170 --> 20:30.182
You want to send my client to jail
for the rest of his life on a theory?

20:30.245 --> 20:33.406
Now wait,
I misspoke.

20:33.984 --> 20:35.433
It's not a theory.

20:35.771 --> 20:38.808
It's what happened, okay.
He's the guy.

20:39.114 --> 20:42.066
Okay, well, let's see if you're right.
Let's see if this piece

20:42.616 --> 20:44.521
matches this piece.
Do these two go together?

20:46.270 --> 20:47.501
How about this one?

20:47.994 --> 20:50.171
- Nope.
- How about this one?

20:51.851 --> 20:53.930
- How about this one?
- Objection.

20:55.300 --> 20:56.482
Order in this court.

20:58.182 --> 20:59.475
Who is that woman?

20:59.612 --> 21:01.842
That woman, your honor,
is the witness's nurse.

21:01.949 --> 21:05.444
No, she is not my nurse, your honor.

21:05.564 --> 21:09.084
She is my assistant.
My nurse left five years ago.

21:10.396 --> 21:13.068
Well, we're all very sorry
to hear about that, Mr. Monk.

21:16.546 --> 21:17.637
Objection!

21:18.771 --> 21:19.694
To what?

21:20.504 --> 21:22.456
To what I

21:23.725 --> 21:24.725
said...

21:26.996 --> 21:28.954
Mr. Monk, you are testifying.

21:29.554 --> 21:31.696
You cannot object to your own testimony.

21:31.759 --> 21:33.462
Why do you need a nurse, Mr. Monk?

21:33.537 --> 21:35.161
Objection.
Immaterial.

21:35.224 --> 21:37.003
Mr. Monk said he needed a nurse.

21:37.130 --> 21:38.242
I'll allow it.

21:38.398 --> 21:39.840
Answer the question.

21:42.374 --> 21:46.245
I had a breakdown ten years
ago after the death of my wife.

21:46.453 --> 21:48.800
That was the same time you
left the police force, correct?

21:48.863 --> 21:52.067
Could you please explain to us the exact
circumstances of your departure

21:52.284 --> 21:53.553
from the police force?

21:55.893 --> 21:58.827
- Psychiatric discharge.
- I can't hear you, Mr. Monk.

22:02.687 --> 22:04.882
It was a psychiatric discharge.

22:05.929 --> 22:08.666
We're all very sorry
for your loss, detective Monk...

22:08.729 --> 22:11.079
excuse me,
former detective Monk.

22:11.352 --> 22:13.855
Former detective Monk.
I'm sure you would do anything

22:13.918 --> 22:16.285
to impress the commissioner
to get your badge back.

22:16.348 --> 22:19.261
Objection.
Mr. Monk is not on trial.

22:19.463 --> 22:21.305
It establishes credibility, your honor.

22:21.548 --> 22:22.611
Overruled.

22:22.997 --> 22:25.319
Former detective Monk,
isn't it true

22:25.382 --> 22:28.254
that the only way you could get
reinstated is to be appearing

22:28.317 --> 22:30.309
to be solving a high-profile case.

22:30.372 --> 22:32.641
A high-profile case,
just like this one.

22:32.704 --> 22:36.308
Appearing to solve, no.
I did not appear to solve anything.

22:36.522 --> 22:39.603
I solved the case.
I solved it. He's the guy.

22:39.900 --> 22:43.001
He is the guy. He chopped it
all up with a jackhammer.

22:43.296 --> 22:44.591
Where is the jackhammer?

22:45.230 --> 22:47.377
He had all morning to get rid of it.

22:48.367 --> 22:51.773
Look, it's so obv...
And these pieces do fit together.

22:51.836 --> 22:53.966
I'll show you.
Okay? Here, look.

22:54.478 --> 22:55.722
This one

22:56.746 --> 22:57.940
goes with...

23:00.542 --> 23:01.779
this one.

23:04.537 --> 23:05.717
Wait a sec.

23:06.811 --> 23:08.845
All right, look.
All right.

23:10.935 --> 23:12.001
Hold that one.

23:12.612 --> 23:16.110
While this one...
not that one...

23:17.045 --> 23:18.045
that one...

23:21.433 --> 23:22.433
not that one.

23:33.152 --> 23:34.662
How do you find the defendant?

23:55.384 --> 23:57.511
This verdict isn't going
to bring Nancy back.

23:57.574 --> 23:58.957
Nothing can do that.

23:59.020 --> 24:01.530
{\pos(192,230)}But it did restore my faith
in the American legal system.

24:01.593 --> 24:03.566
{\pos(192,230)}It's the best legal system in the world.

24:03.811 --> 24:05.189
{\pos(192,230)}At least it was today.

24:06.320 --> 24:07.543
It's my fault.

24:07.756 --> 24:09.823
Don't beat yourself up.
You can't win 'em all.

24:09.907 --> 24:12.795
{\pos(192,230)}The gravel and the microphone.
What was I thinking?

24:12.951 --> 24:14.510
You had a hell of a run.

24:14.738 --> 24:16.310
{\pos(192,230)}Nobody goes undefeated forever.

24:16.373 --> 24:18.343
- What happens now?
- Nothing{\happens now}.

24:18.406 --> 24:20.750
It's over. Mr. Gildea can never
be tried again.

24:21.005 --> 24:23.002
He's right.
It's called double jeopardy.

24:23.592 --> 24:25.588
- How do you sleep at night?
- Like a baby.

24:25.672 --> 24:27.850
In a {\really}expensive bed.
Thanks for asking, though.

24:28.240 --> 24:29.190
And, detective?

24:29.253 --> 24:30.635
- Lieutenant.
- Lieutenant.

24:30.698 --> 24:33.582
You're wrong. Some people
do go undefeated forever.

24:37.506 --> 24:38.871
And I still hate you.

24:40.745 --> 24:41.826
That's weird.

24:42.758 --> 24:44.107
- What?
- The taillights.

24:44.294 --> 24:45.704
On evan gildea's car.

24:46.068 --> 24:47.902
They don't match.
One is brighter.

24:48.315 --> 24:50.322
We can't arrest him for that.
Give it up.

24:50.385 --> 24:51.989
It's over.
They beat us.

24:57.504 --> 25:00.187
We are almost out of time,
so I want to thank our guest

25:00.860 --> 25:03.044
His book is called undefeated:

25:03.335 --> 25:04.753
the Harrison Powell story,

25:05.142 --> 25:07.658
Do you have a card
in case I get in trouble?

25:07.721 --> 25:09.605
You know, a speeding ticket
or something?

25:09.841 --> 25:12.350
You know, Sean, for you,
as a matter of fact, I do.

25:12.928 --> 25:15.035
For any criminal in San Francisco,

25:15.098 --> 25:17.956
this is basically
a get-out-of-jail-free card,

25:18.019 --> 25:20.852
Because you are a regular Mr. Monopoly.

25:21.145 --> 25:22.146
I guess I am.

25:27.039 --> 25:28.318
I've made a decision.

25:29.569 --> 25:30.593
I'm quitting.

25:32.058 --> 25:33.682
I'm not taking any more cases.

25:34.293 --> 25:35.999
I'm sorry to hear that, Adrian.

25:37.648 --> 25:39.787
Is it because of the Tv interview?

25:40.022 --> 25:41.096
What interview?

25:41.159 --> 25:43.235
Harrison Powell was on TV last night.

25:43.534 --> 25:44.711
You didn't see it?

25:45.777 --> 25:46.961
Did he mention me?

25:47.995 --> 25:49.189
I don't remember.

25:50.398 --> 25:51.556
You don't remember?

25:52.361 --> 25:53.843
How long was the interview?

25:54.523 --> 25:55.796
About ten minutes.

25:55.859 --> 25:58.461
You saw a ten-minute interview
last night,

25:58.682 --> 26:01.226
and you don't remember
if my name was mentioned?

26:02.143 --> 26:04.585
All right, he might have
mentioned your name.

26:06.106 --> 26:08.650
I should have known.
You're a very good detective.

26:08.864 --> 26:11.915
Yes, I am a good detective.
But I'm a terrible witness,

26:11.978 --> 26:13.526
which is why I'm quitting.

26:14.291 --> 26:16.438
Adrian, setbacks like the one

26:16.501 --> 26:18.618
you just experienced are a part of life.

26:18.803 --> 26:21.046
You could argue they're
the most important part of...

26:21.109 --> 26:22.829
You don't understand.
A killer...

26:23.398 --> 26:26.263
a stone-cold killer is back
on the street because of me.

26:26.501 --> 26:29.219
Because that lawyer
Harrison Powell ripped me apart

26:29.282 --> 26:30.627
on the witness stand.

26:31.355 --> 26:32.808
You weren't there.
He...

26:33.429 --> 26:35.927
he dismantled me.
I was helpless.

26:36.274 --> 26:38.468
- I understand.
- It's going to happen again.

26:38.531 --> 26:39.955
What's to prevent it?

26:40.698 --> 26:42.270
I'll solve another case,

26:42.333 --> 26:43.997
then somebody else will be arrested,

26:44.060 --> 26:46.928
and all they have to do is hire
Harrison Powell.

26:47.470 --> 26:50.584
It's like he has one of those
get-out-of-jail-free cards.

26:51.607 --> 26:53.122
It's funny you mention it.

26:53.185 --> 26:54.789
That's exactly...

26:55.906 --> 26:56.906
never mind.

26:57.336 --> 26:58.966
I'm a liability now.

26:59.393 --> 27:01.340
I'm the weak link.
Believe me,

27:01.980 --> 27:03.573
I'm doing the city a favor.

27:04.511 --> 27:08.173
All right, before you decide,
let me tell you a little story.

27:08.374 --> 27:10.997
No, there's nothing you can say.
My mind is made up.

27:11.644 --> 27:13.122
Just hear me out.

27:13.563 --> 27:14.563
Please.

27:15.169 --> 27:16.897
Is this a long story?

27:16.960 --> 27:19.137
- No.
- Is it a parable?

27:21.385 --> 27:24.800
As you know, I went to college
on a baseball scholarship.

27:24.863 --> 27:26.576
Now there was a pitcher in the league

27:26.639 --> 27:29.730
named Scotty Hunt, who was my nemesis.

27:29.994 --> 27:33.146
All right, he had
this sinking curve ball.

27:33.209 --> 27:34.635
I mean, I couldn't touch it.

27:34.698 --> 27:36.133
He struck me out 15 times

27:36.196 --> 27:37.796
- in a row.
- This is a parable.

27:37.859 --> 27:40.606
It's not a parable.
If it's anything, it's an allegory.

27:40.669 --> 27:41.687
I'm quitting.

27:42.688 --> 27:44.423
Please let me finish.

27:45.170 --> 27:46.649
Now I considered giving up.

27:46.891 --> 27:49.074
Then I decided,
I'm not just gonna roll over.

27:49.137 --> 27:52.408
I'm not gonna let this jerk ruin
everything I worked so hard for.

27:52.926 --> 27:55.827
So I went to school on the guy.
I studied him.

27:56.174 --> 27:57.961
I looked for his weakness.

27:58.024 --> 28:00.235
And I realized he had a tell.

28:00.661 --> 28:02.388
He was tipping his curve ball.

28:04.188 --> 28:05.589
Last game of the season,

28:05.652 --> 28:07.736
I'm at bat, bases loaded,

28:07.799 --> 28:10.709
we're down by three, I saw the tell.

28:10.903 --> 28:14.883
I'm looking for the curve ball.
And I nailed it right field fence,

28:15.172 --> 28:17.669
grand slam.
We went on to win the playoffs.

28:21.037 --> 28:24.295
- I don't want to be rude.
Is that the end of the allegory?

28:24.961 --> 28:25.961
Yes, it is.

28:27.620 --> 28:28.665
I'm quitting.

28:33.812 --> 28:36.547
- What are you doing?
- These are my old case files.

28:37.420 --> 28:39.311
I'm organizing them by date,

28:39.638 --> 28:42.795
and then cross-referencing them
by name of the suspect.

28:42.858 --> 28:44.861
The yellow folders indicate
multiple victims.

28:44.924 --> 28:47.207
- What are you gonna do after
- I'm gonna burn them.

28:47.270 --> 28:49.995
- You can't quit, Mr. Monk.
- Already have.

28:50.395 --> 28:53.362
Mr. Monk, there's a case,
a very important case.

28:53.425 --> 28:55.128
Nobody else can handle it.

28:55.313 --> 28:57.617
I know what you're trying
to do, but it won't work.

28:57.680 --> 28:58.996
My mind's made up.

28:59.465 --> 29:01.030
She's not asking Monk.
I am.

29:03.553 --> 29:05.274
It's Rudy, my little buddy.

29:05.460 --> 29:07.328
You remember the kid
from the courthouse?

29:07.845 --> 29:10.919
The D. A Just announced
that they want to try him as an adult.

29:11.724 --> 29:13.195
The kid's looking at 25 years.

29:14.644 --> 29:16.421
It's very important to you, isn't it?

29:18.931 --> 29:20.758
Then you don't want me anywhere near it.

29:21.877 --> 29:23.218
You know what happened.

29:23.303 --> 29:25.881
That last case came crashing
down around me.

29:25.944 --> 29:27.761
We want to show you the crime scene.

29:27.824 --> 29:29.725
Come with us.
It'll take 20 minutes.

29:29.809 --> 29:31.337
Maybe you'll see something.

29:34.380 --> 29:35.606
You can't say no.

29:37.567 --> 29:39.068
Well, you can, but you can't.

29:39.412 --> 29:41.737
I can, but I can't?
I don't understand.

29:41.941 --> 29:43.492
You don't, but you do.

29:52.972 --> 29:53.958
He confessed.

29:54.042 --> 29:55.310
To robbing the store.

29:55.544 --> 29:57.555
- He confessed?
- Not to the murder.

29:57.736 --> 29:59.495
Randy, you know the law.

29:59.974 --> 30:03.746
If I go with you and I see something,
then I might have to testify about it.

30:03.893 --> 30:07.309
And if I accuse someone,
they could hire this Powell guy.

30:07.372 --> 30:08.642
They probably will.

30:08.848 --> 30:10.641
Well, I'm willing to take that chance.

30:11.590 --> 30:12.590
Why?

30:12.983 --> 30:14.405
Because he didn't do it.

30:25.910 --> 30:28.495
- An auto parts store.
- It's a family business.

30:28.558 --> 30:31.407
It's been closed since the murder,
so the scene is pretty much intact.

30:31.757 --> 30:34.663
Natalie, you be the owner.
You're behind the counter.

30:39.632 --> 30:40.838
She was older.

30:41.083 --> 30:42.215
Pretend I'm older.

30:43.898 --> 30:45.676
Fine.
So pretend she's older.

30:46.291 --> 30:48.179
- All right,
Rudy parks out back,

30:48.594 --> 30:51.561
comes inside the store,
he looks around and pretends to shop.

30:51.975 --> 30:53.594
And it's just Rudy and the woman.

30:53.657 --> 30:55.533
- Other witnesses?
- He can't remember.

30:55.596 --> 30:57.955
He thinks there might have
another car parked out back.

30:58.018 --> 31:00.094
Maybe there was
somebody else here inside the store.

31:00.157 --> 31:02.605
- That's not much help.
- I know, Monk.

31:02.944 --> 31:04.529
I mean, he was scared to death.

31:06.439 --> 31:08.262
So he comes over to the counter

31:08.658 --> 31:11.091
"May I have some change?"
She opens the register.

31:14.276 --> 31:15.540
She opens the register.

31:18.180 --> 31:20.920
He grabs the cash,
grabs her gold necklace,

31:21.351 --> 31:23.005
bolts out the door.

31:23.512 --> 31:25.195
- He didn't hit her
or shove her.

31:25.634 --> 31:27.971
No, he swears that he didn't touch her.

31:28.210 --> 31:30.895
I mean, the body was right
over here in the corner

31:30.958 --> 31:34.058
with the murder weapon beside it.
It was a tire iron from the shelf.

31:37.504 --> 31:39.466
So it was spur-of-the-moment.

31:40.248 --> 31:42.262
He didn't plan on killing anyone,

31:42.325 --> 31:44.254
or he would have brought
a weapon with him.

31:44.849 --> 31:46.117
Good point.

31:46.728 --> 31:50.575
Although a good lawyer...
Harrison Powell, for example...

31:50.977 --> 31:53.895
might say rudy didn't have
to bring a weapon with him

31:53.958 --> 31:56.828
because he knew there'd be
something like a tire iron

31:56.891 --> 31:57.839
in the store.

31:57.902 --> 32:01.195
"It is an auto parts store,
isn't it, former detective Monk?

32:01.258 --> 32:04.393
"Have you ever been
inside an auto parts store,

32:04.456 --> 32:06.062
"former detective Monk?

32:06.242 --> 32:08.318
Do you even own a car,
former detective Monk?"

32:08.381 --> 32:10.728
- Mr. Monk, what are you doing?
- "Oh, that's right.

32:10.791 --> 32:12.295
"They won't give you a license.

32:12.358 --> 32:14.233
Isn't that true, former detective Monk?"

32:14.296 --> 32:16.518
"Objection!" "Order in the..."

32:21.361 --> 32:23.447
- What's the use?
- Mr. Monk, come on, come on.

32:23.510 --> 32:26.761
You got to forget about Harrison Powell.
You got to keep going. Come on.

32:27.195 --> 32:29.095
Do the hand... do the hand thing.

32:29.158 --> 32:31.099
Go on, go on.
You got it, you got it.

32:38.832 --> 32:40.628
There's a camera?

32:40.691 --> 32:42.362
But the recorder's empty.

32:42.425 --> 32:44.712
Which means the killer
must have taken the tape.

32:45.598 --> 32:47.674
But your friend Rudy is short.

32:48.191 --> 32:50.121
He's, what, 5'4"?

32:50.343 --> 32:51.343
- 5'4 1/4".

32:51.997 --> 32:54.128
Well, he couldn't reach that shelf.

32:54.969 --> 32:56.628
There's no stepping stool.

32:56.691 --> 33:00.128
"He didn't need a stepping
stool, former detective Monk.

33:00.338 --> 33:03.139
"There are hundreds of things
here he could have stood on.

33:03.202 --> 33:06.050
"Why are you crying,
former detective Monk?

33:06.113 --> 33:08.076
"Why don't you stop wasting
everyone's time

33:08.139 --> 33:10.613
- and get the hell out of here?"
- Objection, badgering...

33:12.814 --> 33:13.814
yourself.

33:14.762 --> 33:16.127
Overruled.

33:17.790 --> 33:20.495
Mr. Monk, come on, come on.

33:20.558 --> 33:22.195
Come on, come on.
Look at me.

33:22.258 --> 33:24.941
Look at me! You have to get this lawyer
out of your head.

33:25.004 --> 33:27.533
You're not thinking straight.
Come on, Randy. Keep reading.

33:28.074 --> 33:29.074
Let's see.

33:29.410 --> 33:31.462
"There's $30 missing from the register.

33:31.525 --> 33:33.761
"She was struck once
in the back of the skull,

33:33.846 --> 33:36.000
- medulla oblongata."
- Wait, wait.

33:37.358 --> 33:40.205
- She was only hit once?
- Yeah, she died instantly.

33:41.214 --> 33:44.214
That's exactly
how Nancy Gildea was killed.

33:44.442 --> 33:45.927
- Monk, you're right.
- Yeah.

33:47.164 --> 33:49.402
When did this happen?
What was the day?

33:49.486 --> 33:50.486
October 1st.

33:51.572 --> 33:52.863
About 10:00 pm?

33:54.936 --> 33:56.659
That's right.
How did you know that?

34:24.091 --> 34:25.771
Mr. Monk, what are you looking for?

34:34.196 --> 34:35.281
This.

34:45.025 --> 34:47.158
If you're trying to scare me,
you can forget it.

34:47.385 --> 34:49.838
{\pos(192,230)}I was acquitted, remember?
Jury of my peers.

34:49.900 --> 34:52.347
{\pos(192,230)}This isn't about your wife, Mr. Gildea.

34:53.306 --> 34:55.036
{\pos(192,230)}This is about sara paddock.

34:55.100 --> 34:57.970
Different murder.
Different case.

34:58.666 --> 34:59.371
Who?

34:59.434 --> 35:01.329
She was the woman
at the auto parts store

35:01.392 --> 35:04.655
{\pos(192,230)}you murdered when you were leaving town.
That was her name.

35:05.025 --> 35:06.361
Sara Paddock.

35:08.039 --> 35:09.648
{\pos(192,230)}It's okay. Just take your time.

35:10.192 --> 35:12.168
{\pos(192,230)}- I'm not sure.
- I'm sorry.

35:12.485 --> 35:14.403
{\pos(192,230)}I read about that.

35:14.828 --> 35:17.921
{\pos(192,230)}The auto store.
I thought you caught that kid.

35:17.984 --> 35:20.471
There was a young man in the store.

35:20.686 --> 35:22.903
He robbed the place,
he grabbed a few bucks,

35:22.966 --> 35:24.838
but he didn't kill anyone.

35:25.405 --> 35:26.682
Here's what happened.

35:28.960 --> 35:29.627
What?

35:30.763 --> 35:34.216
Nothing. It just feels good
to say that again, especially to him.

35:35.873 --> 35:37.153
Here's what happened.

35:37.650 --> 35:39.272
You drove to San Francisco,

35:39.335 --> 35:41.304
and you murdered your wife,
no matter what

35:41.367 --> 35:43.838
the jury said, you murdered your wife.

35:44.149 --> 35:46.537
<i>But as you were leaving,
you had a problem.</i>

35:46.719 --> 35:50.704
<i>One of your taillights was burned out.
You couldn't driving home like that.</i>

35:50.767 --> 35:53.155
<i>If the cops stopped you,</i>

35:53.218 --> 35:54.781
<i>your alibi would be ruined.</i>

35:54.844 --> 35:56.948
<i>There was an auto parts store
up the street,</i>

35:57.190 --> 35:58.838
<i>you ran in to buy a new bulb,</i>

35:59.337 --> 36:02.373
<i>you were gonna pay cash,
nobody would ever know you were there.</i>

36:02.436 --> 36:04.404
<i>But your timing was terrible.</i>

36:05.130 --> 36:06.138
Don't worry.

36:06.201 --> 36:07.832
We've got everything on video.

36:07.916 --> 36:09.471
<i>Now you had a bigger problem.</i>

36:09.954 --> 36:11.771
<i>As soon as she reported it,</i>

36:12.420 --> 36:14.880
<i>the cops would take a look
at the security tape.</i>

36:14.964 --> 36:17.943
<i>And we'd see you in the store
three blocks away</i>

36:18.006 --> 36:21.637
<i>from where your wife was killed,
and you couldn't afford that.</i>

36:24.341 --> 36:27.270
If it's all right with you,
I'm gonna wait for my attorney.

36:27.710 --> 36:30.354
His name is Harrison Powell.
I think you might remember him.

36:33.868 --> 36:35.192
He's in my head again.

36:37.024 --> 36:39.488
No, Monk, he's actually...
he's here.

36:40.559 --> 36:41.365
Thank god.

36:41.449 --> 36:43.265
I've been brought up to speed.

36:43.328 --> 36:46.078
I understand you found
a burnt-out taillight bulb

36:46.141 --> 36:47.550
next to an auto parts store.

36:47.613 --> 36:51.374
Congratulations, former
detective Adrian Monk.

36:51.437 --> 36:52.501
May I?

36:52.742 --> 36:56.046
This... this bulb must fit, what,
50 models?

36:56.364 --> 36:57.448
31.

36:58.007 --> 36:59.394
31 models.

36:59.735 --> 37:01.698
Former detective Adrian...

37:02.523 --> 37:04.848
Monk, have you ever
been inside an auto parts store?

37:04.911 --> 37:07.870
Do you even drive a car,
former detective Monk?

37:09.102 --> 37:11.803
If you guys aren't gonna charge him,
with anything, and I can tell

37:11.866 --> 37:14.856
by the dumbfounded expressions
on your faces that you're not at all.

37:14.941 --> 37:17.558
You can turn that off
'cause we're hitting the road.

37:17.819 --> 37:20.033
Let's go, fella.
I'm double-parked.

37:29.200 --> 37:31.033
The truth will come out, Powell.

37:31.818 --> 37:33.226
Somehow it always does.

37:33.581 --> 37:35.221
Your client killed that woman.

37:36.301 --> 37:38.065
When are you people
gonna stop hassling me?

37:38.128 --> 37:40.201
You've got the real killer here.

37:40.488 --> 37:42.546
That dope-smoking,
chain-snatching, little thug

37:42.609 --> 37:44.386
right over there.
He killed her.

37:44.742 --> 37:45.930
Everybody knows it.

37:46.846 --> 37:48.724
Excuse me.
Wait a minute.

37:50.041 --> 37:51.771
Hey, did you hear what he just said?

37:52.012 --> 37:54.031
Yes, I did.
I wonder why you're asking.

37:55.695 --> 37:57.444
Did you hear what he just said?

37:59.704 --> 38:00.970
I didn't say anything.

38:01.197 --> 38:03.739
You just called that young man

38:04.342 --> 38:06.492
"a chain-snatching,
dope-smoking little thug."

38:06.902 --> 38:08.035
I was being kind.

38:09.197 --> 38:11.705
How did you know
about the chain-snatching?

38:11.789 --> 38:12.838
He read it.

38:12.901 --> 38:16.210
It wasn't in the papers.
It wasn't even in the police report.

38:18.217 --> 38:20.963
There is only one possible way

38:21.148 --> 38:23.125
he knew Rudy took that necklace.

38:25.286 --> 38:26.655
You saw it happen.

38:27.110 --> 38:30.494
It's called guilty knowledge.
And juries eat it up.

38:31.645 --> 38:34.824
Mr. Gildea, you're under arrest.

38:34.887 --> 38:37.272
Randy, would you like to do the honors?

38:37.356 --> 38:38.315
My pleasure.

38:40.672 --> 38:41.944
Yes. Yes.

38:44.440 --> 38:47.667
Do you really want to go
up against me again,

38:47.730 --> 38:49.201
former detective Monk?

38:49.668 --> 38:50.819
Yes, I do.

38:51.246 --> 38:52.788
I'll see you on the ball field.

38:52.873 --> 38:55.843
- The ball field?
- I've seen your curve ball.

38:56.778 --> 38:58.335
I can hit it now.

38:59.067 --> 39:01.677
- I'm really looking forward to this.
- No, you're not.

39:11.268 --> 39:13.230
- He is gonna rip me apart.
- No, he's not.

39:13.293 --> 39:16.186
Mr. Monk, you're gonna do great.
You've seen his curve ball.

39:16.271 --> 39:18.110
I don't even know what that means.

39:18.173 --> 39:19.880
I can't believe I'm doing this again.

39:19.943 --> 39:22.155
I'm proud of you.
You're getting back on the horse.

39:23.211 --> 39:24.557
A couple of suggestions.

39:25.466 --> 39:28.485
Just a thought.
Maybe work on not crying...

39:28.670 --> 39:30.803
I mean, quite so much
in front of the jury.

39:31.442 --> 39:33.976
- That's a good note.
- -Yeah, also, you can think

39:34.039 --> 39:35.284
"mayday" all you want,

39:35.347 --> 39:38.000
but it's probably a mistake
to yell the word "mayday"

39:38.085 --> 39:40.442
- from the witness stand.
- Did I do that?

39:40.505 --> 39:42.055
- Couple times.
- More than.

39:42.118 --> 39:45.184
- I better write these down.
- I have to return these cuffs.

39:45.247 --> 39:47.046
- There are no timeouts.
- Right.

39:47.109 --> 39:48.170
No do-overs.

39:48.682 --> 39:50.996
No heavy, heavy sweating.

39:55.118 --> 39:58.020
We find the defendant guilty
of murder in the second degree.

40:02.859 --> 40:04.819
Are you surprised?
What went wrong today?

40:04.882 --> 40:07.525
{\pos(192,230)}- You gonna change the name of the book?
- No comment. Come on.

40:07.588 --> 40:08.661
Excuse me.

40:09.144 --> 40:10.964
Go ahead.
Say it.

40:11.743 --> 40:13.375
It hurts, doesn't it?

40:17.733 --> 40:19.308
How's your little buddy,

40:19.371 --> 40:21.517
He's gonna get 500 hours
of community service.

40:21.580 --> 40:23.814
And I'm getting him a job
at the station house too.

40:23.877 --> 40:25.289
Really make him work it off.

40:25.442 --> 40:28.717
Somebody working at the station house.
That will be sort of refreshing.

40:33.486 --> 40:34.431
Don't say it.

40:34.515 --> 40:36.442
- I'm proud of you.
- You can say it.

40:36.505 --> 40:39.652
You were the best witness ever.
You answered all the questions.

40:39.715 --> 40:41.102
You didn't get rattled,

40:41.165 --> 40:43.824
even when the microphone
was all bent up and twisted.

40:44.058 --> 40:46.577
- You ignored it.
- I don't know why you're so surprised.

40:46.640 --> 40:47.828
Just doing my job.

40:47.891 --> 40:49.839
Come on, Mr. Expert witness.

40:49.926 --> 40:51.157
I'll drive you home.
