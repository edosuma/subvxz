[man] Has he been
acting strange lately?

00:42.276 --> 00:45.679
No more stranger than
a teenager acts.

00:48.482 --> 00:51.128
- Does he have a girlfriend?
- Yes.

00:51.152 --> 00:53.363
Did they break up or something?

00:53.387 --> 00:59.369
No, no. Not at all.
He's crazy about her.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.271
Has he been giving things away

01:01.295 --> 01:03.673
or acting like he didn't
care about anything anymore?

01:03.697 --> 01:08.512
Why are you asking
all these questions?

01:08.536 --> 01:12.882
If you think my son
committed suicide,

01:12.906 --> 01:17.178
well, you've just
got it all wrong.

01:19.480 --> 01:22.750
We found this note
near his body.

01:24.718 --> 01:28.332
Who's Vaughn? He was
going to see Vaughn.

01:28.356 --> 01:31.368
It's his brother.

01:31.392 --> 01:33.437
Zayvaughn.

01:33.461 --> 01:35.829
Where does he live?

Me.

You died?

02:10.798 --> 02:12.642
White like what?

02:12.666 --> 02:15.345
I was 11. I don't know.

02:15.369 --> 02:17.605
White, like, beyond clean.

02:19.373 --> 02:20.917
Everything was just white.

02:20.941 --> 02:24.721
You know, still.

02:24.745 --> 02:29.259
Everything was like
still and calm.

02:29.283 --> 02:33.297
But the silence,
it was powerful.

02:33.321 --> 02:35.865
That's what woke me up.

02:35.889 --> 02:39.403
I woke up in the hospital.

02:39.427 --> 02:42.263
They said my foster
mother did cpr.

02:46.334 --> 02:48.245
I done conquered death,

to be scared of?

[Pounding at door]

03:02.416 --> 03:06.430
[Woman] Zayvian, what
are you doing in there?

03:06.454 --> 03:10.634
Your father wants to talk
to you when you're done.

03:10.658 --> 03:14.704
Robert, I found
this in the place.

03:14.728 --> 03:17.707
That's his place. We
agreed to not go in there.

03:17.731 --> 03:21.645
This is my house. I can
go wherever I want.

03:21.669 --> 03:24.272
I found this.

03:26.407 --> 03:29.819
Something's wrong with our son.

03:29.843 --> 03:31.521
We can't ignore it anymore.

03:31.545 --> 03:34.748
You have got to say
something to him.

03:37.951 --> 03:39.853
What the fuck happened
to my brother?

03:41.722 --> 03:42.832
No, Robert, please,

03:42.856 --> 03:45.034

03:45.058 --> 03:47.361
Please.

03:51.665 --> 03:56.713
So you wanna know what the
fuck happened to your brother?

03:56.737 --> 03:59.440
Yes, sir.

04:01.442 --> 04:04.412
I could fix it so you
could ask him yourself.

04:06.980 --> 04:09.393
Would you like me
to do that for you?

04:09.417 --> 04:11.752
Look at me when you talk to me.

04:13.020 --> 04:16.357
No, sir.

04:32.873 --> 04:34.742
Zayvian...

04:36.444 --> 04:38.822
I need you to pick up
Marsha tomorrow morning.

04:38.846 --> 04:41.515
Her car's in the shop.

04:44.718 --> 04:47.597
You know...

04:47.621 --> 04:50.791
We didn't have this trouble
with you when you were young.

04:53.861 --> 04:56.464
I'm almost 19.

05:09.042 --> 05:11.855
You guys lied to me.

05:11.879 --> 05:14.014
He didn't get sick. He drowned.

05:15.048 --> 05:16.684
Who told you that?

05:21.589 --> 05:24.368
I know he did.

05:24.392 --> 05:29.430
Well, you told yourself a lie.

05:34.902 --> 05:37.605
So tell me the truth.

05:40.841 --> 05:43.720
I'm not allowed to
talk about that night.

05:43.744 --> 05:47.090
You're not daddy's child.

05:47.114 --> 05:49.082
[Sighing]

05:54.788 --> 06:00.770
Zayvian, we agreed to tell you

06:00.794 --> 06:03.740

06:03.764 --> 06:05.766
So, i...

06:08.569 --> 06:10.804
The time is right now.

06:12.840 --> 06:16.152
I keep thinking about it.

06:16.176 --> 06:19.923
It haunts me, mama.

06:19.947 --> 06:22.058
I'm hearing voices.

06:22.082 --> 06:25.886

07:02.790 --> 07:05.735
Zay, thank you so much for

07:07.495 --> 07:09.138

If not, it'll cost my
foster care check.

Yeah, I gotta be at
the community center,

07:43.597 --> 07:44.941

It's made with titanium.
It can stop anything.

Just treat it like a...
An American express card.

Good thing we hit them
spots last night, huh?

Look, no more
robberies, all right?

08:42.121 --> 08:44.300

08:49.863 --> 08:52.942
You see the way them boys

08:52.966 --> 08:55.912

Mike never knows
about last night.

09:05.713 --> 09:07.591
What happened if he did?

09:07.615 --> 09:10.326
What if someone knew about
your little secret?

09:10.350 --> 09:13.329
What is that supposed to mean?

09:13.353 --> 09:15.965
Yeah, you ain't laughing now.

09:27.296 --> 09:29.212
I'm gonna go down
to the cemetery.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.980
You know, it's the
eighth anniversary.

I'll see you at lunch?

09:34.842 --> 09:36.853
I'm not going this year.

09:36.877 --> 09:39.623
That's the only time I know my
three boys are together again.

09:39.647 --> 09:43.192
And you can visit your father's
grave while you're there.

09:43.216 --> 09:46.062
I'm not gonna visit somebody
that doesn't know I'm there.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.297
We should be there.

09:48.321 --> 09:50.667
I'm waiting for Horace today.

09:50.691 --> 09:53.069
This might be the day.

09:53.093 --> 09:56.873
Horace isn't coming home.

09:56.897 --> 10:00.810
Then what am I waiting for?

10:00.834 --> 10:02.178
Horace is dead.

10:02.202 --> 10:05.181
You remember that. You owe him.

10:05.205 --> 10:06.315
A life for a life.

10:06.339 --> 10:08.051
You leave that gang.

10:08.075 --> 10:11.020
- Why do I owe him?
- You tell me.

10:11.044 --> 10:13.422
V23 is not a gang.
It's a brotherhood.

10:13.446 --> 10:17.694
You have a brother... Eddie.
Get close to him.

10:17.718 --> 10:19.362

Then don't come home.

10:26.326 --> 10:28.137
I would rather separate
from you myself

10:28.161 --> 10:30.974
before I let six feet
of dirt do it for me.

10:30.998 --> 10:33.376
Your father never wanted
a hoodlum for a son.

10:33.400 --> 10:36.112
- What?
- Your friend zay?

10:36.136 --> 10:37.814
He killed his own brother

10:37.838 --> 10:39.082
and he raped that girl.

10:39.106 --> 10:41.350
He is evil, Mike.

10:41.374 --> 10:45.221

[Mike] He likes it.

11:15.876 --> 11:17.086
Yo, I talked to the boys.

11:17.110 --> 11:18.922
They ain't going for
this new stuff.

11:18.946 --> 11:20.323
They with me. What you gonna do?

11:20.347 --> 11:22.792
Can't make a move without zay.

11:22.816 --> 11:25.795
Already did. The boys
like getting paid.

11:25.819 --> 11:29.933
I follow zay to hell and back.

11:29.957 --> 11:33.126
Go ahead. Bet you
won't make it back.

[Bell ringing]

11:39.967 --> 11:42.111

for providing you
with a wonderful

11:46.439 --> 11:48.217
free education in our
public school system.

11:48.241 --> 11:52.021
No. Seriously?

Guys, guys.

11:59.152 --> 12:00.353
Guys.

12:13.834 --> 12:16.212
It's supposed to be a mural.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.981
Didn't have money to
finish it last year.

12:18.005 --> 12:21.184
Yeah, last year, the
kids stood on the corner

12:21.208 --> 12:24.788
and collected money for
this special backdrop.

12:24.812 --> 12:27.090
They hired an artist.

12:27.114 --> 12:29.525
He brought paint, he
painted the corners,

12:29.549 --> 12:32.361
- and then he skipped town.
- Mmm.

12:32.385 --> 12:34.563
Last year, the kids learned
their first lesson.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.365
Don't trust adults.

12:36.389 --> 12:39.502
[Girl] You always got
something to say.

12:39.526 --> 12:42.371
Mr. Brewster, let's
finish the mural.

12:42.395 --> 12:46.575
Um, I think that takes talent.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.945
When is the award
ceremony again?

12:48.969 --> 12:51.280
Four weeks from today.

12:51.304 --> 12:53.817
All right, that gives us
enough time to finish it.

12:53.841 --> 12:55.401
Just tell your dad to
write you a check.

12:55.425 --> 12:58.287
He buys you everything anyways.

12:58.311 --> 13:02.859

important right now.

I'll be working on this mural.

13:07.154 --> 13:09.198
Oh, no, you won't.
You'll be slinging a mop

13:09.222 --> 13:11.134
and a broom like the rest of us.

13:11.158 --> 13:12.869
- We're not your maids.
- Mr. Brewster?

13:12.893 --> 13:14.493

on, guys, guys, guys.

13:14.517 --> 13:16.277

All right, well,
you got this one.

next one, though.

[Rap music playing]

13:40.253 --> 13:42.453
I wouldn't be here if you had
just pulled out, you know?

13:42.477 --> 13:46.147
But you don't do condoms.

13:53.066 --> 13:56.345
Maybe I should just tell
Georgia about this, huh?

13:56.369 --> 13:58.081
Ask her if you use a condom

13:58.105 --> 14:00.573
when you screw an uppity snatch.

14:04.444 --> 14:06.222
Don't mess with me, Paula.

14:06.246 --> 14:07.280
Get off.

14:11.418 --> 14:12.561
I can't breathe!

14:12.585 --> 14:15.455
Hold still! I don't care.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.292
Come on, pee.

14:28.401 --> 14:31.214
I wouldn't be here if you had
taken care of your business.

14:31.238 --> 14:32.615
Look, I'm not
careless like that.

14:32.639 --> 14:34.474
Well, then you must be lucky.

14:45.252 --> 14:46.319
Call her.

14:47.955 --> 14:49.098
I'm not doing that.

14:49.122 --> 14:50.958
Make it right!

15:13.180 --> 15:16.025
Yo, it's just I hear
Damon talking about you.

15:16.049 --> 15:17.417
I ain't worried about no Damon.

15:19.652 --> 15:22.331
I told you not to
come over here.

He had to fly back to
Miami this morning.

45:32.163 --> 45:34.842
Did y'all pay for this?

45:34.866 --> 45:38.412
What's that got to
do with anything?

45:38.436 --> 45:43.217
Did he pay for this?

45:43.241 --> 45:45.443
They had insurance.

45:52.851 --> 45:54.185
Did he cry?

45:57.989 --> 46:00.234
Max was in a coma, baby.

46:00.258 --> 46:02.804
I'm not talking about Max.

46:02.828 --> 46:05.430
And then he just slipped away.

46:06.932 --> 46:08.133
He didn't slip.

46:11.169 --> 46:13.371
Somebody dropped him.

46:19.845 --> 46:21.379
Zayvian...

46:25.216 --> 46:27.052
In the attic...

46:29.054 --> 46:31.465
The picture...

46:31.489 --> 46:36.437
Being naked and
cutting yourself,

46:36.461 --> 46:38.964
baby, why?

46:40.966 --> 46:42.233
I'll heal.

46:45.904 --> 46:47.873
But you were crying.

46:51.209 --> 46:54.846
Did daddy cry when
he saw Max's body?

46:59.417 --> 47:00.886
Yeah.

47:03.488 --> 47:07.225
Your name's listed in the
funeral program under "family."

47:09.627 --> 47:12.597
"A special fraternal twin."

48:20.098 --> 48:21.142
What up, zay?

48:21.166 --> 48:23.010
Mike, who called the corner?

48:23.034 --> 48:25.112
I wasn't there.

48:25.136 --> 48:26.547
Ketchup? Ernie?

48:26.571 --> 48:29.350
I called it.

48:29.374 --> 48:31.109
So you calling the
shots, now, huh?

48:35.180 --> 48:38.159
We ain't about to start a war
with some raggedy-ass gang.

48:38.183 --> 48:39.360
We're better than that.

48:39.384 --> 48:41.095
V23's a memorial.

48:41.119 --> 48:43.464
We respect the dead.

48:43.488 --> 48:45.266
Come on, man.

48:45.290 --> 48:46.633
Nah, I created this group

48:46.657 --> 48:48.202
because I was missing something.

48:48.226 --> 48:51.505
I chose you because you
were missing something.

48:51.529 --> 48:54.065
You didn't choose me.
Remember that.

48:56.534 --> 49:01.015
Death took something from
us and I want it back!

49:01.039 --> 49:03.408
You're screwing with the
wrong thing, homey.

49:08.413 --> 49:11.525
- Walk, Mike.
- What's you gonna do?

49:11.549 --> 49:13.384
I said walk, Mike.

49:19.624 --> 49:23.604
What's up? Me or Jordan?

49:23.628 --> 49:26.673
Yo, my bad.

49:26.697 --> 49:29.143
Family.

49:29.167 --> 49:30.601
Sure thing.

49:48.419 --> 49:50.664
What y'all waiting for?

49:50.688 --> 49:52.566
Man, this is stupid.

49:52.590 --> 49:54.101
We ain't nobody's little kids.

49:54.125 --> 49:55.726
We ain't gotta prove nothin'.

50:06.071 --> 50:07.405
Zay.

50:08.739 --> 50:11.085
What did you do?

50:11.109 --> 50:13.311
It's the price you
pay for brotherhood.

50:14.845 --> 50:16.581
Come on, let's go to the movies.

50:25.156 --> 50:27.134
- What up?
- What's up?

50:27.158 --> 50:29.303
How Ernie doing?

50:29.327 --> 50:30.604
He's living.

50:30.628 --> 50:32.273
His mom's mad.

50:32.297 --> 50:33.857
She talking about he
can't play with us,

50:33.881 --> 50:36.843
like we children or something.

50:36.867 --> 50:39.780
So we gonna talk about it?

50:39.804 --> 50:43.184
I'm not about to talk
about removing zay.

50:43.208 --> 50:45.119
All right.

50:45.143 --> 50:46.511
Then let's talk
about your funeral.

50:49.780 --> 50:51.758
He's... he's just a little
mixed up right now.

50:51.782 --> 50:54.128
Heard about what
happened at the game?

50:54.152 --> 50:55.796
I was there.

50:55.820 --> 50:58.365
He left the field
after the first play.

50:58.389 --> 51:01.426
Caught the ball, scored,
and then bounced.

51:02.427 --> 51:04.395
He did what he had to do.

51:06.101 --> 51:07.341
You know, I talked to the boys.

51:07.365 --> 51:09.810
They all with me.

51:09.834 --> 51:12.479
Ernie was always on board.

51:12.503 --> 51:15.116
He wasn't gonna kill the boy.

51:15.140 --> 51:16.641
How you know that?

51:18.276 --> 51:20.821
I can't do this, man.

51:20.845 --> 51:22.589
I can't.

51:22.613 --> 51:24.658
- Zay been good to me.
- First it was Ernie.

51:24.682 --> 51:27.761
What's gonna happen when
it's your turn, huh?

51:27.785 --> 51:30.831
If zay agrees to step down

51:30.855 --> 51:34.625
and let you run things
for a while, I'm in.

51:36.427 --> 51:38.095
But no one's hurting zay.

51:51.542 --> 51:52.819
[Muttering]

51:52.843 --> 51:56.923
Should we call Mr. Brewster?

51:56.947 --> 52:00.294
No, I'll talk to zay
before he get here.

52:00.318 --> 52:02.263
Talk to me about what?

52:02.287 --> 52:04.189
Y'all didn't think I could...

52:36.421 --> 52:38.889
Who fucked with my art?

52:44.862 --> 52:47.574
Zay, baby, it's okay.
We can fix it.

52:47.598 --> 52:50.477
- It'll be fine. We're all gonna...
- Jordan.

52:50.501 --> 52:52.579
- Walk, Mike.
- No, you can't do this.

52:52.603 --> 52:53.904
Walk, Mike.

52:54.905 --> 52:56.607
Damn it, Mike! Walk!

52:59.444 --> 53:02.447
I'm gonna come over
there and cut that out.

53:04.775 --> 53:06.855
-[Cocks trigger] - Y'all done
fucked with the wrong...

53:06.879 --> 53:10.082
- Stop, man.
- [Gunshots]

53:38.316 --> 53:40.261
They don't know who
they messing with!

53:40.285 --> 53:43.997
All you gotta do is
say and it's done.

53:44.021 --> 53:45.856
Do it. Marcellus,
Damon, and Paula.

53:48.559 --> 53:50.437
Do what?

53:50.461 --> 53:52.630
Mike, there's a price
for doing wrong.

53:55.666 --> 53:57.435
This is for Damon.

53:59.937 --> 54:02.473
[Mike] This is not
what we're about.

54:03.841 --> 54:06.320
I love you, man, but
we can't do this.

54:06.344 --> 54:07.645
No, stop.

54:08.779 --> 54:10.657
This is crazy.

54:10.681 --> 54:13.494
- Zay!
- Yo, who's side are you on?

54:13.518 --> 54:14.828
- Zay's side.
- Then shut up

54:14.852 --> 54:16.497
and go over there
and keep him still

54:16.521 --> 54:18.632
so he don't get in
no more trouble.

54:18.656 --> 54:20.434
[Mike] They're kids.

54:20.458 --> 54:22.636
- They're us.
- They're not like us.

54:22.660 --> 54:26.440
You gonna hurt someone
over a mural?

54:26.464 --> 54:27.974
A painting?

54:27.998 --> 54:29.278
It's just a stupid
painting, man.

54:29.302 --> 54:30.771
Forget it.

54:32.970 --> 54:35.081
[Zayvian] Is that
all it is, Mike?

54:35.105 --> 54:37.007
Hmm? A stupid painting?

54:40.077 --> 54:41.946
- Am I stupid, Mike?
- No.

54:48.953 --> 54:50.997
It's for kids, Mike.

54:51.021 --> 54:53.033
I put in everything.

54:53.057 --> 54:55.460
Max... Vaughn's blood
is in that painting.

54:58.629 --> 55:01.442
You call this stupid?

55:01.466 --> 55:05.712
Now Max is dead. Max
is fucking dead!

55:05.736 --> 55:08.782
Hey, you gotta choose.

55:08.806 --> 55:11.818
Mike loves me like
I love Vaughn.

55:11.842 --> 55:13.487
Isn't that right, Mike?

55:13.511 --> 55:15.789
Yeah.

55:15.813 --> 55:18.091
Then show me.

55:18.115 --> 55:20.461
I won't do you wrong, zay.

55:20.485 --> 55:23.897
Yo, zay, it's gonna
be all right.

55:23.921 --> 55:25.566
It's not gonna be all right!

55:25.590 --> 55:28.669
[Clattering]

55:28.693 --> 55:32.062
Vaughn left me, Max left me.
Now you're gonna leave me?

55:33.931 --> 55:35.433
I ain't gonna do you
like that, zay.

55:39.604 --> 55:41.439
You show me.

55:46.944 --> 55:50.591
Yo, that's Mike, man.

55:50.615 --> 55:52.517
I ain't gonna do you
like that, man.

56:29.754 --> 56:33.066
[Voices echoing, laughing]

56:33.090 --> 56:35.826
[Distorted voices whispering]

57:30.881 --> 57:32.859
I've never seen you
in white before.

57:32.883 --> 57:35.929
You've never seen me
this happy before.

57:35.953 --> 57:38.699
I thought I did when we
did it the first time.

57:38.723 --> 57:42.168
You saw me in love.

57:42.192 --> 57:44.562
Being happy is different.

57:50.568 --> 57:55.706
Hey, look, by tomorrow
I'll be normal.

57:59.243 --> 58:01.111
And I'm gonna marry you.

58:02.880 --> 58:06.893
And then we're gonna find
gonna our lost Jewel,

58:06.917 --> 58:08.819
and we're gonna be rich.

58:10.921 --> 58:14.034
You believe me?

58:14.058 --> 58:15.526
I always do.

58:25.002 --> 58:26.537
Promise?

58:37.081 --> 58:39.593
- [Zayvian] Is dad home?
- [Kate] No, baby.

58:39.617 --> 58:41.161
[Zayvian] Are you gonna tell me?

58:41.185 --> 58:43.864
[Kate] It's complicated.

58:43.888 --> 58:45.699
I can't tell you by myself.

58:45.723 --> 58:48.702
I know I said I was
gonna tell you.

58:48.726 --> 58:53.607
Zayvian, I love
you, you know that.

58:53.631 --> 58:55.833
Yeah.

59:07.845 --> 59:10.023
[Zayvian] Hey, what's up, joy?

59:10.047 --> 59:11.858
You going to miss
wentworth's house?

59:11.882 --> 59:13.727
Yeah, they're having
a party tonight

59:13.751 --> 59:15.829
and my mother wants
me to help cater.

59:15.853 --> 59:17.263
Its a few extra dollars.

59:17.287 --> 59:19.800
All right, well, hop in.
I'll take you.

59:19.824 --> 59:22.135
Oh, um, well, I actually
just missed the bus,

59:22.159 --> 59:23.837
so, if you don't mind...

59:23.861 --> 59:27.173
[Chuckles] I just
gotta make a stop.

59:27.197 --> 59:29.099
Uh, okay, sure.

59:38.876 --> 59:42.623
I've never been to
the place before.

59:42.647 --> 59:45.916
It's, uh, it's not the place.
This is my peace.

59:49.119 --> 59:52.232
Does many girls come here?

59:52.256 --> 59:54.200
[Zayvian] Not the good ones.

59:54.224 --> 59:56.670
I don't even bring Georgia here.

59:56.694 --> 59:59.072
Well, she's a good one.

59:59.096 --> 01:00:02.299
I better go. You scared me.

01:00:04.401 --> 01:00:05.803
Stop.

01:00:07.738 --> 01:00:09.916
Wait. Where you going?

01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:12.085
I have to go cater this party.

01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:13.210
Stop.

01:00:16.213 --> 01:00:19.660
Take your panties off.

01:00:19.684 --> 01:00:20.961
What?

01:00:20.985 --> 01:00:23.930
- [Glass shatters]
- Take your panties off.

01:00:23.954 --> 01:00:27.701
Zay, please. I'm a virgin.

01:00:27.725 --> 01:00:31.395
[Children laughing, baby crying]

01:00:32.997 --> 01:00:34.274
Come on, joy.

01:00:34.298 --> 01:00:37.343
[Girl's voice] You
killed your brother.

01:00:37.367 --> 01:00:38.879
[Baby crying]

01:00:38.903 --> 01:00:40.781
[Girl's voice] You
killed your brother.

01:00:40.805 --> 01:00:43.249
You killed your brother.

01:00:43.273 --> 01:00:44.742
[Voices stop]

01:01:12.436 --> 01:01:15.281
I thought you might be in here.

01:01:15.305 --> 01:01:18.275
It's quiet. I can think.

01:01:20.144 --> 01:01:22.088
Gives me more time with the art.

01:01:22.112 --> 01:01:23.757
I know.

01:01:23.781 --> 01:01:26.851
That's why I've been leaving
the side door open.

01:01:30.955 --> 01:01:33.090
Why you carrying a gun, zay?

01:01:36.126 --> 01:01:37.795
I don't know, Mr. Brewster.

01:01:45.169 --> 01:01:47.404
Why don't you tell me
something you do know, huh?

01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:52.877
I know that I miss somebody
I never even knew.

01:01:55.980 --> 01:01:58.082
I know my parents are liars.

01:02:03.153 --> 01:02:05.255
And I know that I'm evil.

01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:12.229
It's like evil loves me.

01:02:17.301 --> 01:02:20.080
And I gotta just force good

01:02:20.104 --> 01:02:22.472
to come around and just...

01:02:24.408 --> 01:02:26.276
Like me a little bit.

01:02:30.147 --> 01:02:32.016
When I'm with the kids...

01:02:34.418 --> 01:02:37.798
Mike...

01:02:37.822 --> 01:02:39.800
I can feel it.

01:02:39.824 --> 01:02:41.191
I'm good.

01:02:46.330 --> 01:02:47.832
And when you're with Jordan?

01:02:51.268 --> 01:02:53.303
I'm invincible.

01:03:09.386 --> 01:03:15.035
I got a call from a mother
of a girl named joy.

01:03:15.059 --> 01:03:17.895
She says you tried to force
yourself on her daughter?

01:03:22.532 --> 01:03:25.069
My birthday was two days ago.

01:03:27.905 --> 01:03:29.449
Nothing happened.

01:03:29.473 --> 01:03:32.009
We celebrated your birthday.

01:03:36.413 --> 01:03:38.248
Not we.

01:03:39.249 --> 01:03:41.085
I wanted dad to be there.

01:03:43.253 --> 01:03:44.421
We remembered.

01:03:47.557 --> 01:03:50.636
No, you remembered.

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:53.073
You promised to tell
me if he didn't.

01:03:53.097 --> 01:03:57.310
Hey. Hey, don't give
your mother ultimatums.

01:03:57.334 --> 01:03:58.835
Okay?

01:04:04.308 --> 01:04:06.352
You tell me now!

01:04:06.376 --> 01:04:07.945
[Kate] Jesus Christ.

01:04:11.448 --> 01:04:13.450
Damn it, you tell me now.

01:04:19.489 --> 01:04:24.270
I can come in or you can push.

01:04:24.294 --> 01:04:25.595
That's your call.

01:04:28.665 --> 01:04:30.567
What are you gonna do, son?

01:04:34.939 --> 01:04:36.140
Here.

01:04:40.144 --> 01:04:42.588
You gotta make a decision.

01:04:42.612 --> 01:04:44.314
Here.

01:04:46.316 --> 01:04:48.552
What are you gonna do, boy?

01:04:50.687 --> 01:04:52.489
You hear me? What
are you gonna do?

01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:57.561
You decide.

01:05:03.167 --> 01:05:06.612
God blessed me with two sons,

01:05:06.636 --> 01:05:09.373
and then he changed his mind.

01:05:12.009 --> 01:05:15.179
Don't make me change my
mind and send you back.

01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:17.982
Help me.

01:05:20.617 --> 01:05:23.129
Please, help me.

01:05:23.153 --> 01:05:24.254
Send me back.

01:05:28.158 --> 01:05:29.659
Send me back.

01:05:54.551 --> 01:05:56.653
Oh, sweetie.

01:05:58.055 --> 01:06:00.557
- I'm sorry.
- I know.

01:06:05.529 --> 01:06:07.673
You give me a minute.

01:06:07.697 --> 01:06:10.234
Let me speak to your father.

01:06:19.243 --> 01:06:21.354
You do it! You do it now!

01:06:21.378 --> 01:06:24.057
You tell my son what
happened to his brother.

01:06:24.081 --> 01:06:26.392
- Just wait a minute.
- No, you wait a minute.

01:06:26.416 --> 01:06:28.394
I have waited and
waited and waited.

01:06:28.418 --> 01:06:30.230
I am through waiting.

01:06:30.254 --> 01:06:34.034
Listen, if it weren't
for those damn kids...

01:06:34.058 --> 01:06:36.536
-don't you dare blame those kids.
- No!

01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:39.105
Those kids did nothing
but taunt him.

01:06:39.129 --> 01:06:41.241
We're the ones who lied to him,

01:06:41.265 --> 01:06:43.109
made him believe a lie.

01:06:43.133 --> 01:06:45.745
You bribed him into thinking
that it was the truth.

01:06:45.769 --> 01:06:48.414
Get up! He's not a bad kid.

01:06:48.438 --> 01:06:50.150
He's a good honest boy.

01:06:50.174 --> 01:06:52.652
No! Your boy, the one that
lived, is sick, okay?

01:06:52.676 --> 01:06:54.420
- Don't you say that.
- He's sick!

01:06:54.444 --> 01:06:55.621
Don't say that!

01:06:55.645 --> 01:06:58.658
Look at him! Go look at him!

01:06:58.682 --> 01:07:01.261
The nudity, the killing animals,

01:07:01.285 --> 01:07:02.828
cursing, raping!

01:07:02.852 --> 01:07:05.498
That's not sick!

01:07:05.522 --> 01:07:08.534
That's a child in
need of attention.

01:07:08.558 --> 01:07:10.570
Attention from his father.

01:07:10.594 --> 01:07:13.330
Now fill the
prescription, doctor!

01:07:15.099 --> 01:07:16.566
Do it.

01:07:51.135 --> 01:07:53.270
I'll wait up for him.

01:08:11.555 --> 01:08:13.323
We gotta talk.

01:08:15.159 --> 01:08:16.368
Not right now, dawg.

01:08:16.393 --> 01:08:18.470
I got a lot of shit on my mind.

01:08:18.495 --> 01:08:20.340
The guys want a vote.

01:08:20.363 --> 01:08:22.808
We ain't going for this
"windeezing" and shit.

01:08:22.832 --> 01:08:24.234
We wanna go street.

01:08:31.541 --> 01:08:33.586
That's not our purpose.

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:35.388
That's not your purpose.

01:08:35.412 --> 01:08:38.658
You got yours. Let us get ours.

01:08:38.682 --> 01:08:42.228
- Get your own thing.
- This is my thing.

01:08:42.252 --> 01:08:45.831
- They want a vote.
- This ain't no democracy.

01:08:45.854 --> 01:08:48.358
It's time for some new blood.

01:08:51.895 --> 01:08:54.798
- Is that right?
- You ain't been right, man.

01:08:57.334 --> 01:08:59.179
It's my group.

01:08:59.203 --> 01:09:02.381
Those kids? They young.

01:09:02.406 --> 01:09:04.484
They ain't gangsters.

01:09:04.508 --> 01:09:07.444
They survived the shit
you put them through.

01:09:09.845 --> 01:09:12.692
So that's how it's gonna be.

01:09:12.716 --> 01:09:15.752
I'm not being
stepped over again.

01:09:19.988 --> 01:09:21.701
But you gonna step on me.

01:09:21.725 --> 01:09:23.527
In a heartbeat.

01:09:44.613 --> 01:09:48.894
How did the talk go last night?

01:09:48.917 --> 01:09:52.288
It didn't. He never came back.

01:09:55.359 --> 01:09:56.926
I forgot him, Katie.

01:09:59.263 --> 01:10:03.443
You didn't want to
remember Vaughn.

01:10:03.467 --> 01:10:08.472
Every time I see
zay, it reminds me.

01:10:10.307 --> 01:10:11.941
I know, baby.

01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:17.290
He found the newspaper article.

01:10:17.314 --> 01:10:18.648
I know.

01:10:21.451 --> 01:10:23.929
I went to the city, the house.

01:10:23.953 --> 01:10:26.323
I checked the place...

01:10:31.428 --> 01:10:34.374
You know, maybe his car
is parked out back.

01:10:34.398 --> 01:10:37.943
I saw it.

01:10:37.967 --> 01:10:43.483
Katie, I called him
several times.

01:10:43.507 --> 01:10:45.342
There's no answer.

01:10:56.986 --> 01:11:00.433
Hey, what's up?

01:11:00.457 --> 01:11:02.001
- You good?
- Yeah.

01:11:02.025 --> 01:11:04.637
I got you something.

01:11:04.661 --> 01:11:06.672
I'm okay.

01:11:06.696 --> 01:11:08.374
Did you tell anybody
about last night?

01:11:08.398 --> 01:11:10.434
Who am I gonna tell?

01:11:12.068 --> 01:11:14.013
You really need to stop
looking so guilty.

01:11:14.037 --> 01:11:16.516
I shouldn't have gone there.

01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:18.351
I mean, with his
parents and all.

01:11:18.375 --> 01:11:20.353
His parents are
gonna get over it.

01:11:20.377 --> 01:11:23.656
Just like they got over
their other son's death.

01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:26.359
- What?
- Nothing.

01:11:26.383 --> 01:11:30.330
Just something I heard
my mother talking about.

01:11:30.354 --> 01:11:32.064
[Sighs]

01:11:32.088 --> 01:11:33.966
You really need to get
your story straight

01:11:33.990 --> 01:11:35.968
-for where you were last night.
- I'm good.

01:11:35.992 --> 01:11:37.670
All right?

01:11:37.694 --> 01:11:41.106
You know, you could have
been with me, Paula.

01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:44.544
Oh, you like this now?

01:11:44.568 --> 01:11:45.802
No, I mean...

01:11:46.903 --> 01:11:48.037
Paula.

01:11:55.879 --> 01:11:59.616
Jordan, Mike. Where's zay?

01:12:03.587 --> 01:12:06.566
Hey, what you doing in my bag?

01:12:06.590 --> 01:12:08.750
You know, I kill somebody for
touching my stuff, right?

01:12:08.774 --> 01:12:10.135
I thought it was
Christian's bag.

01:12:10.159 --> 01:12:11.759
Does this look like
it got a cross on it?

01:12:11.783 --> 01:12:15.475
Huh? Do it?

01:12:15.499 --> 01:12:18.478
All right, Jordan, she
thought it was my bag.

01:12:18.502 --> 01:12:22.415
I don't care. I don't like
people touching my stuff.

01:12:22.439 --> 01:12:24.708
Yeah, but ain't no need to
be yelling at the girl.

01:12:26.943 --> 01:12:28.721
- You gotta...
- Gotta what?

01:12:28.745 --> 01:12:32.949
The girl made a mistake, Jordan.

01:12:46.062 --> 01:12:47.964
Come on, let's play.

01:12:52.802 --> 01:12:54.638
Come on, man.

01:12:57.807 --> 01:13:00.085
What's wrong, joy?

01:13:00.109 --> 01:13:03.489
Joy, what did you see
in Jordan's bag?

01:13:03.513 --> 01:13:06.115
Nothing, Sandra. I
didn't see anything.

01:13:42.619 --> 01:13:43.929
Man, Rene!

01:13:43.953 --> 01:13:46.666
- Who?
- Mike. He was cutting hearts.

01:13:46.690 --> 01:13:48.834
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm sorry, man.

01:13:48.858 --> 01:13:50.794
- Come on, pay attention.
- I'm sorry.

01:14:00.870 --> 01:14:03.172
- Hey, mom.
- What's wrong?

01:14:05.875 --> 01:14:07.544
Don't touch me.

01:14:09.178 --> 01:14:11.681
What?

01:14:17.854 --> 01:14:19.989
[No audible dialogue]

01:14:24.894 --> 01:14:28.173
Robert! Robert! Robert! Robert!

01:14:28.197 --> 01:14:32.201
Mike, zay's dead.

01:14:36.973 --> 01:14:39.475
[Georgia sobs]

01:14:47.984 --> 01:14:50.587
- [Knocking on door]
- God damn it.

01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:54.900
Damn it.

01:14:54.924 --> 01:14:57.069
Georgia, are you okay?

01:14:57.093 --> 01:14:59.038
[Georgia] Just leave me alone.

01:14:59.062 --> 01:15:02.165
My god, can't I piss in peace?

01:15:15.044 --> 01:15:19.892
[Georgia sniffling, sobbing]

01:15:19.916 --> 01:15:22.027
[Georgia] They have
a school in France

01:15:22.051 --> 01:15:25.197
called the French
girl's academy.

01:15:25.221 --> 01:15:28.233
They don't even use your
name at this school.

01:15:28.257 --> 01:15:30.603
They call you by a number.

01:15:30.627 --> 01:15:32.572
You are a number.

01:15:32.596 --> 01:15:35.841
"356231, you're wanted in
the counselor's office."

01:15:35.865 --> 01:15:38.611
[Joy] That's jail.

01:15:38.635 --> 01:15:41.714
I guess it is in a way,

01:15:41.738 --> 01:15:43.873
punishment for not
being a good girl.

01:15:45.241 --> 01:15:51.223
It's the alternative
to an abortion.

01:15:51.247 --> 01:15:54.927
My mother saw it when
I was four months.

01:15:54.951 --> 01:15:59.131
Baby girl 356231a.

01:15:59.155 --> 01:16:02.802
I called her Zane.

01:16:02.826 --> 01:16:06.672
My father still doesn't know.

01:16:06.696 --> 01:16:09.108
I thought about
slashing my wrists

01:16:09.132 --> 01:16:11.067
to punish my mother.

01:16:13.102 --> 01:16:15.204
But zay stopped me.

01:16:17.707 --> 01:16:22.955
This is our memorial
to our daughter.

01:16:22.979 --> 01:16:24.981
He has one, too.

01:16:27.684 --> 01:16:31.888
Zay promised me he would
get my baby back someday.

01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:35.659
He wouldn't lie to me.

01:17:02.218 --> 01:17:04.754
I wanted to kill myself
when my brother died.

01:17:06.890 --> 01:17:11.227
I saw my older brother Eddie
beat Horace to death.

01:17:15.231 --> 01:17:17.767
He said he stole his cufflinks.

01:17:18.868 --> 01:17:21.881
Eddie's six years older and big.

01:17:21.905 --> 01:17:22.882
He hit him in the forehead.

01:17:22.906 --> 01:17:25.751
His head snapped back.

01:17:25.775 --> 01:17:27.352
He slipped down the steps.

01:17:27.376 --> 01:17:30.222
He was dead before
he hit the wall.

01:17:30.246 --> 01:17:31.724
Messed me up for three years.

01:17:31.748 --> 01:17:34.059
I... I stopped talking.

01:17:34.083 --> 01:17:37.987
I failed the third grade, had
to go to a special school.

01:17:39.422 --> 01:17:41.791
My brain just wouldn't
work until I met zay.

01:17:47.096 --> 01:17:50.776
One day I was on a swing.
He came up behind me.

01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:52.268
"You want a push?"

01:17:55.104 --> 01:17:58.141
One push took me from looking
at the ground to seeing sky.

01:18:02.445 --> 01:18:04.814
[No audible dialogue]

01:18:15.825 --> 01:18:18.294
I was there when zay raped Lisa.

01:18:20.196 --> 01:18:22.131
I talked him into it.

01:18:24.133 --> 01:18:26.135
I was the one holding the door.

01:18:28.304 --> 01:18:29.973
That was our secret.

01:18:32.942 --> 01:18:35.020
Things got complicated
after I found out

01:18:35.044 --> 01:18:36.445
she was my sister.

01:18:40.249 --> 01:18:42.151
I never told zay.

01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:47.166
I was scared he would tell...

01:18:47.190 --> 01:18:49.225
Tell what I'd done.

01:18:52.261 --> 01:18:54.397
I was there to kill him.

01:18:55.799 --> 01:18:58.134
To make it up to my sister.

01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:02.815
Zay?

01:19:02.839 --> 01:19:04.149
[Sighs]

01:19:04.173 --> 01:19:06.810
Zay knew what it meant
to be a brother.

01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:13.482
He always wanted us to be good.

01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:19.022
But the good guys
don't never win.

01:19:34.037 --> 01:19:37.482
And before I was empty.

01:19:37.506 --> 01:19:41.353
Empty is the starting
point of everything.

01:19:41.377 --> 01:19:43.923
And now I'm full,

01:19:43.947 --> 01:19:47.917
because I found my
brother in all of you.

01:19:52.488 --> 01:19:54.057
[Door rattling]

01:19:55.224 --> 01:19:58.237
Mike?

01:19:58.261 --> 01:20:00.363
I've been waiting for you.
I knew you'd come.

01:20:05.201 --> 01:20:07.980
What's up? What's this?

01:20:08.004 --> 01:20:09.505
Forgetting.

01:20:14.577 --> 01:20:20.083
It made me so big, but I'm shit.

01:20:24.153 --> 01:20:26.956
What are you gonna
do when I'm gone?

01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:34.506
It's time to man up, Mike.

01:20:34.530 --> 01:20:36.299
It's time to be a man.

01:20:38.034 --> 01:20:39.979
It's time to be a man

01:20:40.003 --> 01:20:44.984
and stop hiding
behind my back...

01:20:45.008 --> 01:20:46.475
All the time.

01:20:52.481 --> 01:20:56.395
You know what? Just walk, Mike.

01:20:56.419 --> 01:20:58.998
Just get out of here.

01:20:59.022 --> 01:21:02.134
- Get the fuck outta here, Mike!
- I'm not leaving.

01:21:02.158 --> 01:21:05.161
- Get the fuck out of here.
- I'm not gonna walk this time.

01:21:14.537 --> 01:21:18.117
I didn't mean to rape Lisa.

01:21:18.141 --> 01:21:20.352
I was forced to do it.

01:21:20.376 --> 01:21:22.354
I was pushed. I was...
"let's do it."

01:21:22.378 --> 01:21:24.456
She was in the room.

01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:27.659
Someone was holding the door
and she couldn't get out.

01:21:27.683 --> 01:21:32.497
And we were trapped in there
with my anger and my guilt...

01:21:32.521 --> 01:21:34.666
And I couldn't control myself.

01:21:34.690 --> 01:21:37.202
Why didn't she just lay down?

01:21:37.226 --> 01:21:39.062
Do something?

01:21:42.698 --> 01:21:45.168
Man, I feel real bad about that.

01:21:48.304 --> 01:21:50.639
Look, I didn't mean
to do what I done.

01:21:57.146 --> 01:22:01.126
Oh, Mike, it's like...

01:22:01.150 --> 01:22:03.395
When I enter into a virgin,

01:22:03.419 --> 01:22:05.021
it's like medicine.

01:22:08.024 --> 01:22:13.538
And when I catch that
innocent breath,

01:22:13.562 --> 01:22:16.708
it heals me.

01:22:16.732 --> 01:22:18.377
All the shit in my head,

01:22:18.401 --> 01:22:21.937
all the voices,
everything stops.

01:22:24.107 --> 01:22:25.708
And it's real still.

01:22:32.448 --> 01:22:36.619
I'm dead, but I'm living
it at the same time.

01:22:39.455 --> 01:22:41.124
I don't call that rape.

01:22:55.238 --> 01:22:57.473
I took all their innocence.

01:23:05.148 --> 01:23:06.482
I need help, man.

01:23:07.783 --> 01:23:10.153
Just tell me what to do.

01:23:16.292 --> 01:23:17.993
Take it.

01:23:19.428 --> 01:23:20.496
Take it.

01:23:26.435 --> 01:23:28.504
It's good. You're still good.

01:23:30.173 --> 01:23:32.075
I'm not good.

01:23:34.643 --> 01:23:36.679
Look, my bad.

01:23:39.848 --> 01:23:43.162
You're good. You're good.

01:23:43.186 --> 01:23:45.354
I'm good. I'm good.

01:23:46.822 --> 01:23:48.433
You tell Jordan we're good.

01:23:48.457 --> 01:23:51.170
Where's bullét?

01:23:51.194 --> 01:23:52.261
Where?

01:23:54.297 --> 01:23:56.199
Mike, breathe.

01:23:57.766 --> 01:23:59.668
It's okay.

01:24:05.574 --> 01:24:07.243
I love you, man.

01:24:10.279 --> 01:24:12.381
[Gunshot]

01:24:18.421 --> 01:24:21.133
Mr. Pimpleton, I need
to ask your wife

01:24:21.157 --> 01:24:23.235
a few questions about zayvaughn.

01:24:23.259 --> 01:24:24.703
What for?

01:24:24.727 --> 01:24:27.330
This is the second child
to die under her care.

01:24:31.567 --> 01:24:37.240
My wife would never kill
one of her children.

01:24:39.375 --> 01:24:40.719
It was an accident.

01:24:40.743 --> 01:24:43.888
Zayvaughn drowned.

01:24:43.912 --> 01:24:46.249
It was no accident.

01:24:56.392 --> 01:25:00.763
Back then, my husband was...

01:25:03.432 --> 01:25:07.270
Aggressive and demanding.

01:25:12.208 --> 01:25:15.787
I was giving the babies a bath.

01:25:15.811 --> 01:25:18.781
He came home early

01:25:22.685 --> 01:25:25.430
he called my name,

01:25:25.454 --> 01:25:31.270
and, um, I answered,

01:25:31.294 --> 01:25:33.629
but he couldn't hear me.

01:25:34.797 --> 01:25:38.510
He called my name again

01:25:38.534 --> 01:25:41.846
when I was trying
to pick up the baby

01:25:41.870 --> 01:25:43.806
at the side of the tub.

01:25:46.642 --> 01:25:50.455
He came upstairs

01:25:50.479 --> 01:25:52.648
and he grabbed me
by my ponytail.

01:25:56.385 --> 01:25:58.654
[Stuttering] And i...

01:26:01.324 --> 01:26:06.805
I could see zayvaughn
slip in the tub

01:26:06.829 --> 01:26:09.332
into the water.

01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:16.339
And I saw zayvian fall
in on top of him.

01:26:19.342 --> 01:26:21.653
I tried, I did.

01:26:21.677 --> 01:26:25.490
I tried to get to my babies.

01:26:25.514 --> 01:26:28.327
But my husband's fists...

01:26:28.351 --> 01:26:31.687
He just kept punching
me in the face.

01:26:33.856 --> 01:26:37.159
By the time that I
got to the tub...

01:26:41.029 --> 01:26:43.632
I thought they were both dead.

01:26:46.001 --> 01:26:50.682
Zayvian, zayvian...

01:26:50.706 --> 01:26:52.875
He was fine.

01:26:54.543 --> 01:26:58.357
But zayvaughn...

01:26:58.381 --> 01:27:00.549
He was blue.

01:27:08.056 --> 01:27:10.393
I'm sorry.

01:27:13.396 --> 01:27:16.541
Based on the autopsy

01:27:16.565 --> 01:27:20.379
and the water in his lungs,

01:27:20.403 --> 01:27:24.573
he went 59 seconds without air.

01:27:27.643 --> 01:27:28.911
Mike.

01:27:32.548 --> 01:27:34.450
Yeah, what's up, man?

01:27:40.088 --> 01:27:44.427
- You Jordan?
- What about it?

01:27:46.429 --> 01:27:47.872
I'm rocky.

01:27:47.896 --> 01:27:49.765
Zay said to come see you.

01:27:52.801 --> 01:27:54.779
Yeah, he told me about you.

01:27:54.803 --> 01:27:58.750
I was raised in a crackhouse.

01:27:58.774 --> 01:28:00.609
Zay said you would
understand that.

01:28:07.950 --> 01:28:10.619
Let good find you this time.

01:28:20.529 --> 01:28:22.798
Come on, young blood.

01:28:35.043 --> 01:28:36.979
"Wondini agegnehu."

01:28:40.816 --> 01:28:43.928
I can give you a ride home.

01:28:43.952 --> 01:28:46.631
No, I'm gonna stay
and finish this.

01:28:46.655 --> 01:28:48.967
Why?

01:28:48.991 --> 01:28:51.460
Because it's what zay wanted.

01:28:52.828 --> 01:28:55.831
Don't you paint? Grab a brush.

01:28:58.834 --> 01:29:00.669
Why didn't you tell me?

01:29:02.838 --> 01:29:04.673
It's what you wanted.

01:29:27.663 --> 01:29:28.864

Oh, my god.

01:29:46.549 --> 01:29:48.760

01:29:48.784 --> 01:29:50.886
Oh, sweetie.

01:29:54.056 --> 01:29:57.560
