Lagertha,

01:08.520 --> 01:10.204
you're the last person
I expected to see here.

01:11.440 --> 01:13.647
You and your warriors
are as welcome to us

01:15.200 --> 01:18.044
as spring after the hardest
and most bitter winter.

01:19.240 --> 01:21.481
Rollo, my son and I
are only too glad

01:21.600 --> 01:23.170
to come to Ragnar's aid.

01:28.240 --> 01:29.685

01:39.160 --> 01:41.162
Thank you, Uncle.

01:41.240 --> 01:43.447
Still can't grow
a beard, though.

01:50.560 --> 01:52.483

01:56.520 --> 01:57.521

02:01.440 --> 02:03.408

02:06.040 --> 02:08.088

02:29.080 --> 02:31.082
Thank you, Princess Aslaug.

02:32.400 --> 02:35.927
I brought shield-maidens
to help us in our cause.

02:43.600 --> 02:45.090

02:47.040 --> 02:49.771
My sons, Ubbe and Hvitserk.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.604
I am pleased to see you.

02:55.040 --> 02:57.691
I always knew
that some day

02:57.760 --> 03:00.001
I would meet some
more of Ragnar's sons.

03:01.040 --> 03:02.565
How did you know?

03:05.560 --> 03:07.369
The gods told me.

03:10.760 --> 03:13.081
And you have
a baby? May I?

03:18.600 --> 03:20.364
ASLAUG: His name is Sigurd
Snake-in-the-Eye.

03:22.120 --> 03:23.770
After your father?

03:25.640 --> 03:27.642
And after his own father.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.288
Enough with the pleasantries.
Let's make a plan.

03:48.080 --> 03:49.320
So?

03:49.400 --> 03:51.164
Even with your additional
forces, Lagertha,

03:51.240 --> 03:53.846
we cannot attack Kattegat
and hope to succeed.

03:53.960 --> 03:55.724
Jarl Borg is well dug in.

03:56.320 --> 03:57.890
What do you propose?

03:58.840 --> 04:01.320
We want to drive Jarl Borg
out of Kattegat.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.282
He has no idea we
have been reinforced.

04:04.360 --> 04:08.046
And what would make him leave Kattegat
where he can winter in safety?

04:08.800 --> 04:11.644
The one thing that would threaten
his whole existence there.

04:11.720 --> 04:13.688
And what would that be?

04:14.720 --> 04:16.005
Food.

04:17.959 --> 04:19.849
A few of us will
go into the town

04:19.920 --> 04:21.887
and destroy the
winter grain stores.

04:23.360 --> 04:26.011
I Will do it. I Will go.

04:26.080 --> 04:28.845
No. My son and I shall go.

04:30.640 --> 04:32.369
We'll only need a few men.

04:52.720 --> 04:53.721
Thank you.

05:06.080 --> 05:08.003
I cannot see your face.

05:08.640 --> 05:11.723
I am ex-wife of Christ.
A nun.

05:13.240 --> 05:15.561
I cannot show my
face to any man.

05:16.720 --> 05:19.530
Well, l am not any man.

05:20.920 --> 05:22.922
I am King Ecbert.

05:23.400 --> 05:24.925
And you will
show me your face

05:25.000 --> 05:28.721
or I will be unable to judge whether
or not you're telling me the truth.

05:38.440 --> 05:40.044
Who did this to you?

05:40.760 --> 05:41.841
My husband.

05:41.960 --> 05:43.086
Why?

05:44.680 --> 05:47.763
He claimed I had
been unfaithful.

05:58.480 --> 06:02.121
And were you?
Unfaithful?

06:03.680 --> 06:04.966
No.

06:10.960 --> 06:13.122
What do pagans
say of such cases?

06:23.520 --> 06:25.727
If she was
a free woman,

06:25.800 --> 06:29.771
they would believe her word and
make judgment on her behalf.

06:30.440 --> 06:34.081
But surely her husband
has every right over her?

06:34.160 --> 06:38.165
Surely, she belongs to him
to do with as he sees fit.

06:39.680 --> 06:41.682
Not according to the pagans.

06:44.640 --> 06:48.008
Then pagan laws
are superior to ours?

06:52.200 --> 06:54.680
Not in every case, Sire.

07:01.320 --> 07:04.881
Woman, I find it unlawful
and disagreeable

07:04.960 --> 07:08.248
that your husband should make
false claims against you.

07:08.360 --> 07:11.921
He has provided no evidence
of your cupidity.

07:12.640 --> 07:16.201
Therefore, I dismiss his demand
to have you branded in public.

07:16.760 --> 07:19.411
Thank you.
Oh, thank you, Lord.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.849
Oh, well,
don't thank me.

27:01.040 --> 27:03.042
between Njord and Skadi?

27:03.880 --> 27:06.451
Skadi was a giantess.
Her father was killed.

27:06.560 --> 27:08.961
She strode to Asgard
to get justice

27:09.760 --> 27:14.049
and the gods asked her if she wanted
gold for the death of her father.

27:14.600 --> 27:17.126
"I'll settle for a husband,"
she said,

27:17.200 --> 27:18.531
"And a bellyful of laughter."

27:18.600 --> 27:20.841
This is going to
be a long story.

27:21.320 --> 27:22.810
If you are hundreds
of years old,

27:22.880 --> 27:25.087
then it's a very quick story.

27:27.240 --> 27:28.480
The gods conferred and agreed

27:28.560 --> 27:30.642
that Skadi could choose
a husband from among them,

27:30.720 --> 27:32.609
but they made one condition.

27:33.240 --> 27:36.449
That she choose
him by his feet.

27:38.240 --> 27:39.526
His feet?

27:40.080 --> 27:41.127
Yes.

27:41.840 --> 27:42.841
And Skadi
lost no time

27:42.920 --> 27:45.491
in choosing the most
shapely pair of feet,

27:45.600 --> 27:48.444
believing they would
naturally belong to Baldur,

27:48.560 --> 27:50.767
the most handsome
of the gods.

27:52.240 --> 27:53.765
But they didn't?

27:54.920 --> 27:55.967
No.

27:56.760 --> 27:59.525
They belonged
to the god Njord,

27:59.640 --> 28:02.405
the lord of seafarers
and sea harvests.

28:03.800 --> 28:05.529
His skin was old

28:10.200 --> 28:13.044
I don't want to make a choice
between them.

28:15.680 --> 28:17.011
But if I did,

28:17.960 --> 28:19.962
are you saying
that I should decide

28:20.120 --> 28:22.122
based on the appearance
of their feet?

28:22.840 --> 28:25.161
Neither their feet
nor their faces.

28:26.200 --> 28:28.248
You should examine
their hearts,

28:28.320 --> 28:30.607
their livers,
and every other organ.

28:32.160 --> 28:34.527
In any case, it makes
no difference.

28:34.800 --> 28:36.040
You are only
fooling yourself,
