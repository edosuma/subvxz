Here's your birthday present, Soo Ah.

01:07.073 --> 01:08.243
Darn it.

01:08.972 --> 01:10.143
Someone said that...

01:11.213 --> 01:14.883
if you see the world upside-down, everything looks different.

01:25.563 --> 01:27.222
The sky becomes a lake,

01:27.423 --> 01:30.733
and mountains become shadows reflected in that lake.

01:47.813 --> 01:49.753
My twisted mess of a life.

01:51.013 --> 01:52.822
Is this how it ends?

02:02.093 --> 02:04.192
I must flip everything around and see it differently.

02:04.793 --> 02:07.862
That way, I can see what the truth is.

02:09.132 --> 02:11.203
Where shall I begin my story?

02:11.742 --> 02:14.143
Yes. Let's start from that day.

02:14.703 --> 02:18.143
The first time I saw the world upside-down.

02:18.313 --> 02:20.983
The last time he threw his classmate out the window, you...

02:21.242 --> 02:23.983
You went to see him, apologized,

02:23.983 --> 02:26.322
and compensated them, so we smoothed it over.

02:26.882 --> 02:30.422
This time, a student and a teacher are both unconscious.

02:30.422 --> 02:31.452
(Do Be Man)

02:31.792 --> 02:33.623
Yes. Anyway, we...

02:33.792 --> 02:36.632
Hey! Where do you think you're going?

02:36.632 --> 02:39.003
I was expelled from the third school I was transferred to.

02:39.503 --> 02:41.632
For the exact same reason.

02:42.433 --> 02:44.533
I failed to adapt and broke school rules.

02:45.003 --> 02:46.843
They said I harmed the studious atmosphere.

02:48.042 --> 02:49.343
What's important is that...

02:49.942 --> 02:52.213
there were no more schools to take me in.

You punk.

03:01.722 --> 03:05.023
What is the matter with you?

03:07.093 --> 03:09.792
Be Man. You got expelled on purpose.

03:10.363 --> 03:12.702
Because high-school dropouts don't get drafted.

03:13.232 --> 03:15.273
Why don't you ask to be erased from the family registry?

03:15.373 --> 03:16.533
That gets you out of the army too.

03:16.773 --> 03:20.972
You're the only relative I have left, Auntie.

03:22.912 --> 03:24.373
What are you going to do?

03:25.213 --> 03:27.382
Do you have a plan?

03:28.012 --> 03:30.683
I was born with less than nothing.

03:57.113 --> 04:00.912
You're the first high-school dropout to apply to our law firm.

04:01.113 --> 04:03.713
Doesn't that mean you can't even serve in the army?

04:04.952 --> 04:07.882
I want to abolish discrimination including that regarding education.

04:07.882 --> 04:09.892
That's why I applied to Law and One.

04:10.422 --> 04:12.063
I have a question.

04:12.762 --> 04:14.623
Don't people want to interview you...

04:14.922 --> 04:17.192
about passing the bar as a high-school dropout?

04:17.933 --> 04:22.072
When I heard a guy with a middle-school education had passed,

04:22.773 --> 04:24.672
I was fascinated.

04:25.033 --> 04:26.942
What can you do with that level of education?

04:27.243 --> 04:29.942
Even store clerks have a college degree these days.

04:30.213 --> 04:33.813
Would you trust a lawyer who only finished middle school?

04:34.342 --> 04:37.983
That's when I realized not finishing high school was an obstacle...

04:38.512 --> 04:39.822
passing the bar couldn't overcome.

04:43.652 --> 04:47.223
I'd heard of people agreeing to interview women for fun...

04:47.223 --> 04:50.132
based on the photos on their resumes.

04:50.592 --> 04:51.962
That just happened to me.

04:52.303 --> 04:55.332
You called me for an interview for fun, knowing my circumstances?

04:58.642 --> 04:59.803
My gosh.

05:00.473 --> 05:02.212
Mom, save me!

05:02.212 --> 05:04.473
Did you get enough of me now?

05:04.842 --> 05:06.712

I met the person who would change my life.

05:29.173 --> 05:31.503
In return for accepting the victim's case,

05:31.503 --> 05:34.103
he accepted bribes and illegal forms of entertainment.

05:34.342 --> 05:35.772
An investigation was launched,

05:35.772 --> 05:38.413

Hi, my dear aunt.

05:49.753 --> 05:52.493
Your boisterous tone suggests you didn't get the job.

05:52.822 --> 05:55.793
Oh, please. They're all begging me to come work for them,

05:55.892 --> 05:57.762
but the terms aren't satisfying.

05:58.293 --> 06:00.532
If it's a job I wanted, I would've gotten it already.

06:20.553 --> 06:23.092

06:27.592 --> 06:29.262
That reaction suggests you know who I am.

06:29.663 --> 06:32.132
You're Yong Moon Gu, the managing partner at Law and One.

06:32.803 --> 06:36.772
That's right, and let me say that I've been looking into you.

06:37.103 --> 06:39.702
Sorry? But the interview is over.

06:41.043 --> 06:42.613

06:44.743 --> 06:46.642
Your aunt took you in at the age of ten.

06:46.642 --> 06:48.712
You've been on ten job interviews including the one today,

06:48.712 --> 06:49.813
but none were fruitful.

06:49.813 --> 06:51.983
Studying for the bar sunk you into a pile of debt,

06:51.983 --> 06:54.582
and your credit will soon hit rock bottom.

06:56.553 --> 06:59.522
You... Have you been stalking me?

07:00.692 --> 07:01.962
What is the meaning of this?

07:01.962 --> 07:03.962
Know that you passed my job interview.

07:03.962 --> 07:05.032
Drink up.

07:10.772 --> 07:13.072
Have you ever heard of an offer one can't refuse?

07:14.072 --> 07:16.212
It's a famous line from the movie "The Godfather".

07:16.473 --> 07:17.813
That's what I'm offering you.

07:22.913 --> 07:25.522
About 1.5 million dollars went into this room.

07:27.082 --> 07:29.053
Money can solve many problems,

07:30.293 --> 07:33.192
but I'm more interested in things money can't buy.

07:36.032 --> 07:37.332
Cut to the chase, will you?

07:40.832 --> 07:41.863
Here.

07:45.772 --> 07:47.202
Serve a stint in the military.

07:52.043 --> 07:54.483
As a military prosecutor. What do you say?

08:01.322 --> 08:03.053
I enjoyed you showing off your money.

08:04.652 --> 08:06.592
But I didn't go to high school which gives me an exemption.

08:07.692 --> 08:11.132
Work little and earn loads, sir.

08:11.793 --> 08:13.962
You probably heard about the arrested military prosecutor.

08:14.402 --> 08:15.473
Do you know...

08:16.233 --> 08:19.272
how much he earned while working with me?

08:23.043 --> 08:24.942
You'll get a ten percent commission...

08:25.142 --> 08:27.813
and be given five times the salary of those snobby lawyers...

08:27.813 --> 08:30.512
who looked down on you during the job interview.

08:32.123 --> 08:35.152
Isn't it a deal that can change your life?

08:37.753 --> 08:38.993
I guess it is.

08:40.262 --> 08:42.092
It could change my life completely.

08:45.603 --> 08:48.532
Those studying law may be smart upstairs,

08:48.532 --> 08:51.902
but they're known to lack empathy which seems to be true.

08:54.373 --> 08:57.973
Didn't you learn anything while digging into my background?

09:04.652 --> 09:06.623
- Salute! - Goodness.

09:07.522 --> 09:08.682
- Mom. - Yes?

09:08.682 --> 09:10.193
I'll also join the army when I grow up.

09:10.193 --> 09:12.022
Really? Sounds like a good idea.

09:13.292 --> 09:15.632

09:58.032 --> 10:01.172
I'm... I'm sorry.

10:05.682 --> 10:09.182
Mom? Open your eyes.

10:09.983 --> 10:12.052
Please open your eyes.

10:12.422 --> 10:14.083
Mom!

10:21.022 --> 10:24.463
My parents passed away in their military uniforms...

10:26.203 --> 10:27.703
in front of my eyes.

10:30.172 --> 10:33.103
Me? The thought of the military gets my blood boiling,

10:33.103 --> 10:36.073
but you want me to enlist voluntarily?

10:36.812 --> 10:39.412
Not even 50 times the salary could get me to enlist.

10:45.253 --> 10:46.983
You seem like someone who can take a beating,

10:48.253 --> 10:50.453
but the heart must be quite fragile.

10:53.463 --> 10:55.323
Do you know why the military is a gold mine?

10:56.532 --> 10:59.363
Because to those with power in this country,

10:59.733 --> 11:01.733
the military is a ticking time bomb.

11:03.833 --> 11:06.243
They don't want their sons to enlist,

11:06.642 --> 11:08.003
but not going would raise eyebrows.

11:10.973 --> 11:14.343
My job is to defuse the bombs that can go off at any time.

11:14.983 --> 11:16.213
To put it simply,

11:17.353 --> 11:20.382
the military is the pressure point of the rich and powerful.

11:21.453 --> 11:23.993
No deity can ever fatten your wallet.

11:24.292 --> 11:25.922
Since you can do that for me,

11:25.922 --> 11:27.593
I'm supposed to answer to you?

11:29.392 --> 11:31.662
You made it this far on your own,

11:31.662 --> 11:33.032
but who do you have in your corner?

11:34.532 --> 11:36.902
You have never had connections before.

11:39.603 --> 11:42.272
What do you say to me being that man for you?

11:43.473 --> 11:45.782
Serve just five years in the military,

11:45.782 --> 11:48.312
and I will offer you a job as a partner at Law and One.

11:49.382 --> 11:50.412
However,

11:51.682 --> 11:54.323
the deal only stands if you satisfy me.

11:55.152 --> 11:56.422
I'm sure many at your firm...

11:57.892 --> 11:59.792
would gladly jump at a chance like that.

12:03.432 --> 12:05.762
Is it too cruel to say that your broken heart...

12:06.262 --> 12:07.703
is what I need?

12:08.103 --> 12:10.103
Because that is something money can't buy.

12:17.812 --> 12:19.443
You were out late today.

12:24.613 --> 12:27.083
Auntie, I got a job.

12:29.123 --> 12:30.522
As if.

12:34.662 --> 12:35.762
Is it true?

12:38.432 --> 12:41.162
Is it for real? Hold on a second.

12:41.703 --> 12:44.632
Which law firm? Tell me.

12:45.132 --> 12:47.642
Come on. Tell me which one.

12:50.042 --> 12:51.042
The military.

12:52.743 --> 12:55.483
Unbelievable. I knew you were pulling my leg.

13:02.823 --> 13:06.392
The military that my parents passionately served in.

13:08.193 --> 13:09.632
What kind of place is it?

13:12.662 --> 13:15.662
(5 years later)

13:25.473 --> 13:26.812
(Cha Woo In)

13:26.812 --> 13:28.113
I take the oath.

13:29.312 --> 13:31.213
I, Cha Woo In,

13:31.613 --> 13:34.282
am only a newly-appointed officer,

13:34.623 --> 13:36.522
but I take pride in myself as a keeper of military law.

13:36.522 --> 13:37.823
With a sense of duty,

13:38.422 --> 13:40.262
I will strictly implement the law...

13:40.262 --> 13:42.292
to tighten discipline within the military.

13:42.562 --> 13:45.193
I will do my utmost best to protect the right to command...

13:45.193 --> 13:48.132
as well as the rights of our soldiers.

14:21.902 --> 14:23.233
- Salute! - Salute!

14:26.873 --> 14:28.473

14:36.613 --> 14:37.753
- Sir! - At ease.

14:38.812 --> 14:39.882
- Sir! - At ease.

14:42.853 --> 14:44.593
- Salute! - At ease.

14:44.922 --> 14:48.292
Hey, come on. That's not what I said!

14:48.292 --> 14:50.632
- Min Gyu, come on! - Over here!

14:50.662 --> 14:52.463
- Attention. - Sir!

14:53.432 --> 14:55.662
It's fine. At ease, everyone.

14:55.662 --> 14:57.272
Let me in on the arm wrestling.

14:57.272 --> 14:58.373
At ease, guys.

14:59.902 --> 15:02.473
- Are you Sergeant Ahn Soo Ho? - Sergeant Ahn Soo Ho.

15:02.473 --> 15:04.073
- Have a seat. - Yes, sir.

15:05.573 --> 15:07.312
How many days until you're discharged?

15:08.282 --> 15:10.083
I was only just promoted to sergeant, sir.

15:10.483 --> 15:12.253
Gosh. Has there been any hassle?

15:12.253 --> 15:13.583
No, sir.

15:16.792 --> 15:19.463
- Bless you. - My apologies, sir.

15:19.762 --> 15:22.593
I doubt it's a cold. It must be rhinitis.

15:22.593 --> 15:24.993
Yes, sir. Allergic rhinitis to be exact.

15:25.162 --> 15:27.532
Being stationed at the front lines means a lot of weeding.

15:27.833 --> 15:29.203
Yes, sir.

15:29.373 --> 15:32.642
Imagine pollen flying in the air from all that weeding.

15:33.243 --> 15:34.672
Having rhinitis sure must be annoying.

15:34.672 --> 15:37.142
No, sir. It's manageable.

15:37.142 --> 15:38.213
Gosh.

15:40.113 --> 15:42.343
What are these marks on your wrist?

15:42.652 --> 15:46.123
I was bitten by mosquitoes during night duty at the guard post.

15:46.282 --> 15:47.453
It's nothing, sir.

15:47.453 --> 15:49.792
How could this be nothing?

15:49.792 --> 15:51.922
Don't underestimate mosquitoes in the military.

15:51.922 --> 15:53.493
You may catch malaria...

15:53.493 --> 15:55.762
and end up getting a medical discharge with a high fever.

15:56.262 --> 15:59.733
Wait. Is that better?

16:02.233 --> 16:03.432
No, sir.

16:03.932 --> 16:07.142
I'll talk to the platoon leader, so get treated off the base.

16:07.443 --> 16:10.873
May I really do that?

16:10.873 --> 16:12.983
Of course.

16:15.213 --> 16:16.652
Who wants to arm wrestle?

16:16.812 --> 16:18.882
- Come on. - Okay.

16:19.083 --> 16:20.223
- No mercy. - Let's do it.

16:20.853 --> 16:22.223
Super famous.

16:22.922 --> 16:24.353
- You've been through a lot. - Sir.

16:24.552 --> 16:25.593
Hey.

16:25.922 --> 16:28.162
What brings the military prosecutor to the barracks?

16:28.522 --> 16:29.892
I came to see Sergeant Ahn Soo Ho.

16:30.193 --> 16:32.262
- Sergeant Ahn? - That's right.

16:32.662 --> 16:35.463
Was a complaint filed against him? That can't be.

16:36.603 --> 16:38.733
He must get along with the other soldiers.

16:38.873 --> 16:41.603
Yes, he is. He is very good to his subordinates.

16:42.103 --> 16:45.912
Some soldiers who were transferred use their leave to visit him.

16:46.213 --> 16:48.812
Wow. That bank president's son is impressive.

16:50.412 --> 16:53.323
Did you just say "bank president"?

16:53.782 --> 16:54.882
Didn't you know?

16:56.152 --> 16:58.892
Sergeant Ahn Soo Ho's father is the president of Gusan Bank.

16:59.823 --> 17:02.093
I had no idea.

17:02.562 --> 17:04.093
He never said.

17:04.262 --> 17:05.292
Oh no.

17:06.302 --> 17:08.062
I shouldn't have said anything.

17:08.662 --> 17:11.203
Don't tell anyone else. Don't suddenly be nice...

17:11.672 --> 17:13.443
as his platoon leader.

17:13.873 --> 17:15.003
I won't, sir.

17:15.503 --> 17:16.573
Let's go.

17:17.443 --> 17:18.873
A bank president's son is suffering from...

17:18.873 --> 17:20.583
harsh training at the battlefront.

17:21.113 --> 17:22.312
That's unusual.

17:22.883 --> 17:24.983
And he's just a simple rifleman.

17:25.082 --> 17:27.522
He could've received special treatment if he wanted.

17:27.622 --> 17:30.393
Celebrities have to maintain their image...

17:30.393 --> 17:33.092
or they want to erase their past and go to the battlefront.

17:33.362 --> 17:35.993
But a bank president's son has no reason to do that.

17:35.993 --> 17:37.133
Am I right?

17:37.963 --> 17:40.362
There may be a reason.

17:46.243 --> 17:49.572
Hello, Major. This is Captain Do Be Man.

17:50.272 --> 17:53.282
There is a sergeant in the barracks suffering from rhinitis.

17:54.082 --> 17:57.913
Yes. It seems an air purifier is needed.

17:59.383 --> 18:00.483
Thank you, sir.

18:19.233 --> 18:21.102
- Hello, sir. - Hey.

18:21.842 --> 18:23.372
Where are the other soldiers' things?

18:23.743 --> 18:25.973
Wow. Do you have this room to yourself?

18:26.143 --> 18:30.052
Yes, sir. I was ordered to until I am discharged.

18:30.183 --> 18:32.112
Nice. Lucky you.

18:32.552 --> 18:35.052
That's right. How's your rhinitis?

18:35.453 --> 18:37.592
I know this won't cure it, but...

18:37.792 --> 18:39.423
It's much better, sir.

18:39.923 --> 18:41.062
But...

18:41.993 --> 18:43.133
What?

18:43.792 --> 18:45.433
I feel bad.

18:45.893 --> 18:49.362
Ever since you came by, I've been excused from weed removal work,

18:49.703 --> 18:52.602
and I'm sitting here alone with the air purifier on.

18:54.072 --> 18:57.012
It is true that I was struggling due to rhinitis.

18:57.842 --> 18:59.483
Thank you for resolving it for me.

19:09.592 --> 19:12.993
That's right. I don't think they replace the water filter much.

19:14.322 --> 19:16.933
It's fine. I'll just drink the filtered water.

19:17.062 --> 19:19.332
They're here for you to drink.

19:19.332 --> 19:21.903
Drink it. What's the big deal?

19:22.832 --> 19:23.872
Yes, sir.

19:27.802 --> 19:29.812
Don't be so cautious. I know you like it.

19:33.683 --> 19:35.782
- Hello, sir. - Hey.

19:36.213 --> 19:40.183
I'll leave after I give this to Sergeant Ahn, sir.

19:40.383 --> 19:41.453
Sure.

19:46.163 --> 19:47.262
What is this?

19:48.362 --> 19:49.693
It's your uniform.

19:51.993 --> 19:53.133
Your underwear too.

19:53.133 --> 19:54.832
The washer broke,

19:55.003 --> 19:57.372
so my platoon leader washes them for me at the officers' quarters.

19:57.802 --> 20:00.203
I said I'd wash them by hand, but...

20:00.203 --> 20:03.312
Everyone's nice to do because you're so nice to them.

20:03.572 --> 20:05.342
Don't feel too bad.

20:05.443 --> 20:07.812
You seem like a really good person.

20:08.213 --> 20:10.612
I'll visit you once I'm discharged.

20:15.923 --> 20:19.292
A military prosecutor is investigating...

20:19.292 --> 20:21.723
the son of the president of Gusan Bank...

20:21.792 --> 20:25.163
for receiving preferential treatment during his military service.

20:25.493 --> 20:27.933
All eyes are on the military prosecutor...

20:27.933 --> 20:31.173
to see what determination they make.

20:31.272 --> 20:35.042
The soldier in question is said to have denied the accusations.

20:51.923 --> 20:54.522
There may be

20:55.193 --> 20:58.062
Many cool men

20:58.433 --> 21:01.362
But I am a real man

21:01.762 --> 21:03.203
A cool man

21:03.203 --> 21:04.433
Captain Cha Woo In?

21:05.403 --> 21:07.372
- Yes. - Hello, ma'am.

21:07.703 --> 21:08.772
Hello.

21:09.042 --> 21:11.743
I'm Section Chief Ahn Yoo Ra. It's nice to meet you.

21:11.943 --> 21:13.643
It's nice to meet you as well.

21:13.812 --> 21:15.413
I'll escort you.

21:15.413 --> 21:17.683
- Shall we go? - Sure.

21:19.483 --> 21:21.953
Staff Judge Advocate Seo Joo Young is working off the base.

21:21.953 --> 21:25.153
Most military prosecution department has only one military prosecutor,

21:25.153 --> 21:27.223
but ours tends to have many incidents,

21:27.223 --> 21:28.592
so we have two.

21:29.022 --> 21:30.332
The other...

21:31.393 --> 21:32.792
- Here he comes. - Any problems?

21:32.792 --> 21:34.032
It should be fine.

21:34.503 --> 21:36.032
The military prosecutor, Captain Do Be Man.

21:36.602 --> 21:37.933
She's the new...

21:37.933 --> 21:39.003
Sorry,

21:39.003 --> 21:40.503
but I have to get to an interrogation.

21:43.413 --> 21:44.572
Hurry up.

21:45.012 --> 21:46.143
Yes, sir.

21:49.143 --> 21:51.312
You know about the special treatment case, right?

21:51.312 --> 21:54.923
He's quite irritable because it's receiving so much attention.

21:55.423 --> 21:57.693
Let me escort you to the document room.

21:59.052 --> 22:02.193
Don't you think the new military prosecutor is very pretty?

22:03.163 --> 22:05.032
Did you call the reporters?

22:05.032 --> 22:06.503
Pardon? Yes, sir.

22:06.602 --> 22:09.262
I called every single one.

22:17.112 --> 22:18.572
Captain. Sir.

22:18.913 --> 22:22.512
They're saying I received special treatment or something.

22:22.713 --> 22:25.782
But you know the truth. Please clear up the misunderstanding.

22:27.683 --> 22:29.522
If they don't understand, we will make them...

22:30.022 --> 22:31.723
and clear up misunderstandings in here.

22:32.453 --> 22:35.562
I'm not a fan of interior decor, but oh well. Have a seat.

22:36.592 --> 22:38.193
Yes, Captain.

22:38.463 --> 22:41.302
In here, I'm not your captain, I'm the military prosecutor.

22:41.433 --> 22:44.203
- Okay? - Yes, sir.

22:44.503 --> 22:46.173
Have a seat. Sit.

22:51.473 --> 22:54.213
Okay. Just answer my questions truthfully...

22:54.312 --> 22:56.453
with either yes or no.

22:57.012 --> 22:58.812
Yes, sir.

23:00.923 --> 23:04.822
Is it true that you had an eight-man room to yourself?

23:04.822 --> 23:07.163
I didn't request it.

23:07.163 --> 23:08.362
I only followed orders...

23:08.362 --> 23:09.893
Answer yes or no.

23:12.163 --> 23:13.362
Sergeant Ahn Soo Ho.

23:16.733 --> 23:18.173
Did you have the room to yourself?

23:19.003 --> 23:21.143
Yes, sir. I did, but...

23:21.143 --> 23:23.042
You had a room by yourself.

23:25.572 --> 23:27.743
How long did you have the room by yourself?

23:28.012 --> 23:30.483
It was immediately after they brought in the air purifier.

23:31.552 --> 23:32.683
These are documents for cases...

23:32.683 --> 23:34.552
that are granted with a stay of prosecution.

23:34.582 --> 23:36.653
There are also documents for suspicious death cases...

23:36.653 --> 23:38.852
for which the truth has not been ascertained.

23:38.852 --> 23:41.562
You can let me know if you need anything.

23:41.562 --> 23:43.733
Or feel free to come in and access the files as you please.

23:43.893 --> 23:45.562
Do you have any questions?

23:45.562 --> 23:46.663
No, ma'am.

23:47.703 --> 23:51.503
I'll show you the officers' quarters where you'll be living then.

23:51.503 --> 23:54.372
Actually, I'd like to see the interrogation room first.

23:54.903 --> 23:56.042
Right now?

23:56.713 --> 23:59.072
Captain Do is probably questioning someone right now.

23:59.473 --> 24:00.883
Can't you go after he's done?

24:01.483 --> 24:04.753
I'm not here for a tour. I'll find my way to my quarters.

24:05.082 --> 24:07.582
Let's go to the interrogation room, in which a war is raging.

24:07.953 --> 24:10.223
I'd like to see how Captain Do works as well.

24:14.893 --> 24:17.493
But the air purifier was... Captain...

24:19.362 --> 24:22.233
I mean, sir. Didn't you get it for me, sir?

24:22.332 --> 24:23.473
Me?

24:24.703 --> 24:25.733
Why?

24:30.842 --> 24:34.443
There's an assertion that you had a stack of imported bottled water.

24:34.842 --> 24:37.183
I didn't order them.

24:37.183 --> 24:39.112
It doesn't matter who bought them.

24:39.413 --> 24:42.082
I'm asking if you received special treatment...

24:42.082 --> 24:45.153
of having imported bottled water in your room, Sergeant Ahn Soo Ho.

24:47.562 --> 24:50.463
Yes, sir. It's true I drank it.

24:50.463 --> 24:52.893
There's an assertion that you had the platoon leader do your laundry.

24:53.503 --> 24:54.903
It's your uniform.

24:55.762 --> 24:56.872
Your underwear too.

24:57.102 --> 24:58.832
That's absolutely absurd.

24:58.832 --> 25:01.973
How could I tell my platoon leader to do my laundry?

25:02.143 --> 25:04.072
He was just being nice to me.

25:04.173 --> 25:06.143
You saw it yourself.

25:06.582 --> 25:07.743
Just being nice.

25:09.082 --> 25:12.753
I don't know. His statement is the complete opposite.

25:13.082 --> 25:15.153
He stated he had no choice...

25:15.153 --> 25:16.953
in case it would hinder his promotions.

25:17.723 --> 25:18.953
That's not true.

25:19.153 --> 25:22.562
He felt deeply degraded for having to do laundry for...

25:22.663 --> 25:24.693
and deliver drinks to his subordinate,

25:24.832 --> 25:26.762
but his official statement reads that he had no choice.

25:31.602 --> 25:34.643
On top of that, you were excused from weed removal and other work,

25:34.643 --> 25:36.713
permitted to leave the base and have visits against the rules.

25:38.473 --> 25:41.042
You left the base because you were bit by a mosquito...

25:41.042 --> 25:43.582
and returned the next day without a doctor's evaluation.

25:43.983 --> 25:45.453
That's AWOL.

25:49.552 --> 25:51.253
Out of all the facts listed so far,

25:51.253 --> 25:53.163
tell me if there's anything you didn't do.

26:04.532 --> 26:05.633
Sign it.

26:20.923 --> 26:22.153
What's wrong?

26:24.322 --> 26:25.493
Do you think it's unfair?

26:29.092 --> 26:31.233
Too bad you have the wrong parents.

26:34.032 --> 26:36.233
Then this wouldn't have happened to you.

26:37.003 --> 26:38.003
Right?

26:54.383 --> 26:56.253
The public showed great interest...

26:56.253 --> 26:59.393
in the Gusan Bank president's son suspected of being pampered,

26:59.393 --> 27:01.062
and we took it seriously.

27:01.423 --> 27:03.163
After a thorough investigation,

27:03.633 --> 27:06.933
I concluded that all the suspicions were true.

27:07.463 --> 27:10.433
The Ministry of National Defense Prosecutor's Office acknowledges...

27:10.532 --> 27:14.272
that all soldiers must be treated equally,

27:14.602 --> 27:16.743
and those who use their parents' wealth...

27:17.072 --> 27:20.612
for personal gain or safety will be punished severely.

27:21.143 --> 27:22.943
I hope that this case...

27:22.943 --> 27:25.153
serves as a cornerstone on which...

27:26.213 --> 27:27.852
special treatment is eradicated.

27:28.352 --> 27:31.822
I am military prosecutor Do Be Man and that's all.

27:37.032 --> 27:39.792
Gusan Bank President Ahn Byung Goo, the soldier's father...

27:39.792 --> 27:42.332
issued a written apology stating he feels responsible...

27:42.332 --> 27:44.203
and resigned from his post.

27:44.203 --> 27:46.772
This was Joo Il Seok for TBC News.

27:48.943 --> 27:52.042
Mr. Yong. Gusan Bank demands the repayment of my loan.

27:53.842 --> 27:55.713
I don't want to return my 500 million dollars.

27:56.612 --> 27:59.512
Think of the money I'll lose if I invest that much.

28:00.522 --> 28:03.923
Isn't it the easiest time in history to make money?

28:04.052 --> 28:07.493
Was the call made by the president who took over last year?

28:08.762 --> 28:10.532
Then he's the one who must go.

28:11.092 --> 28:12.262
What's his name?

28:14.262 --> 28:15.802
Ahn Byung Goo.

28:26.713 --> 28:29.082
Mr. Yong. Good job.

28:32.383 --> 28:33.782
Military Prosecutor Do.

28:33.782 --> 28:36.852
The staff judge advocate is waiting. Let's talk on the way.

28:37.522 --> 28:40.622
I watched your briefing. I'd like to learn from you.

28:40.622 --> 28:42.822
You spied on me in the interrogation room.

28:43.022 --> 28:45.762
I apologize. But you can't have seen me.

28:48.233 --> 28:50.532
Here's a tip since it's your first day.

28:51.203 --> 28:54.072
You need eyes on your back too if you want to survive.

28:54.743 --> 28:57.342
I'm really fortunate to be able to start off...

28:57.342 --> 28:58.772
with a senior like you.

28:58.772 --> 29:01.082
Oh, too bad.

29:01.413 --> 29:03.183
You're only half fortunate.

29:03.753 --> 29:05.383
I leave soon.

29:06.183 --> 29:08.153
Oh, that is too bad.

29:09.522 --> 29:12.022
You got into the interrogation room on your first day,

29:12.153 --> 29:13.963
and I think highly of your passion,

29:14.393 --> 29:15.963
but don't ever cause trouble.

29:15.963 --> 29:17.532
Not until I'm discharged.

29:17.993 --> 29:19.062
Yes, sir.

29:19.562 --> 29:21.403
The investigation was done well,

29:21.633 --> 29:23.973
and the briefing even more so.

29:24.433 --> 29:25.532
Thank you, sir.

29:27.203 --> 29:29.673
Cha Woo In. Whenever...

29:29.673 --> 29:31.713
a newbie military prosecutor shows up,

29:31.812 --> 29:33.943
I always ask this one question.

29:34.812 --> 29:38.153
Are you a prosecutor or a soldier?

29:39.683 --> 29:42.253
I wear the clothes of a military prosecutor,

29:42.253 --> 29:43.352
but I'm a soldier!

29:43.822 --> 29:44.893
Salute!

29:47.292 --> 29:48.362
Good!

29:54.733 --> 29:57.532
I failed to get the point of your question. I apologize.

29:58.532 --> 30:01.643
Do you think rank comes before the law or vice versa?

30:01.943 --> 30:05.473
When military command and law clash, which will you put first?

30:05.473 --> 30:07.243
Is that so hard to understand?

30:08.913 --> 30:11.953
In a military court, I am a prosecutor.

30:12.913 --> 30:14.822
What? You're a prosecutor?

30:15.282 --> 30:17.122
Why are you a prosecutor?

30:17.122 --> 30:18.653
You are a soldier!

30:18.653 --> 30:20.592
I do not think so.

30:21.163 --> 30:23.663
The military uniform you're wearing.

30:23.663 --> 30:25.733
Are you still a military prosecutor without it?

30:25.733 --> 30:28.463
You have power and authority in a military court...

30:28.463 --> 30:31.102
because your uniform bestows it upon you!

30:32.703 --> 30:34.602
Even so, I am a prosecutor.

30:35.272 --> 30:37.342
If I am a soldier all about command and discipline,

30:37.342 --> 30:39.213
I would be unable to judge criminals...

30:39.213 --> 30:40.913
who are above me in rank.

30:41.213 --> 30:44.282
That is why in court, I cannot be a soldier.

30:46.112 --> 30:47.923
What? You dare...

30:49.122 --> 30:50.852
judge whom?

30:52.253 --> 30:54.393
Criminals, sir.

30:59.663 --> 31:00.703
Get out.

31:02.233 --> 31:03.633
Get out, this instant!

31:08.872 --> 31:09.943
Hey.

31:11.673 --> 31:14.913
Pull yourself together. You're in the army.

31:15.312 --> 31:18.812
You can't attack the highest officer in our department on your first day.

31:18.812 --> 31:20.383
I did not attack him.

31:20.683 --> 31:22.383
I only answered his question.

31:22.653 --> 31:26.122
See? You're not even shying from me.

31:27.322 --> 31:29.322
Your life here might become a nightmare.

31:29.493 --> 31:32.663
Whether you're an officer or a private, this is the army.

31:32.832 --> 31:34.562
This is the pinnacle of social order...

31:34.562 --> 31:36.062
I don't need your advice.

31:36.062 --> 31:38.372
Aren't you getting discharged soon anyway?

31:39.973 --> 31:41.042
My gosh.

31:43.403 --> 31:46.213
You won't have anything to do with someone who's about to leave?

31:46.372 --> 31:48.042
Don't jump to conclusions.

31:49.983 --> 31:52.552
I need to teach you properly until the day I leave.

31:53.213 --> 31:54.322
Follow me.

32:01.893 --> 32:04.233
Salute, Captain Do.

32:04.832 --> 32:07.403
Call me whenever, and I'll do my best to...

32:07.403 --> 32:10.062
Don't you have a soldier lined up for questioning?

32:10.062 --> 32:13.572
Let our new military prosecutor Cha Woo In take that.

32:13.943 --> 32:15.973
What? His interrogation?

32:16.243 --> 32:18.812
She just joined. Give her a break.

32:18.812 --> 32:20.072
We get off soon.

32:20.072 --> 32:21.582
Prosecutors never get off.

32:22.443 --> 32:24.883
Am I wrong, Captain Cha the prosecutor?

32:25.753 --> 32:27.953
No. To a military prosecutor,

32:27.953 --> 32:29.723
a case comes before getting off work.

32:30.352 --> 32:31.423
That's it.

32:32.393 --> 32:35.963
I'm a soldier and I'm off duty, so I'll go home now.

32:36.993 --> 32:39.832
Prosecutor Cha, get up to speed on the case...

32:40.032 --> 32:42.262
and begin interrogation tomorrow.

32:42.762 --> 32:43.973
Yes, sir.

32:47.503 --> 32:48.943
Let's have some wine.

32:53.683 --> 32:56.683
- Clean up, will you? - Why did he wink?

32:58.713 --> 33:01.423
He's a rough one.

33:01.423 --> 33:03.183
Stay safe when you're with him.

33:03.753 --> 33:06.052
- I hope we get along. - Sure.

33:08.663 --> 33:11.393
You didn't upset Captain Do, did you?

33:11.832 --> 33:15.233
I don't know. If there's a reason, I'll find out in time.

33:27.943 --> 33:30.183
(Managing Partner Yong Moon Gu)

33:30.453 --> 33:32.282
Captain Do Be Man is here.

33:33.483 --> 33:34.683
Welcome.

33:38.693 --> 33:40.052
- Sit. - Thanks.

33:43.062 --> 33:45.092
How was that to wrap up...

33:45.092 --> 33:46.592
the five years I promised?

33:46.963 --> 33:50.133
The platoon leader had a huge part. What did you give him?

33:51.302 --> 33:52.802
For doing the laundry?

33:53.233 --> 33:54.772
I didn't give him anything.

33:55.042 --> 33:57.143
What if it were to bite me in the behind?

33:58.213 --> 34:00.483
I only slipped him the information that...

34:00.782 --> 34:02.342
his father was a bank president.

34:03.483 --> 34:06.052
And they did the rest without any hints from you?

34:06.483 --> 34:09.122
They left him out of the hard work and gave him days off.

34:09.122 --> 34:11.552
That was special treatment disguised as consideration.

34:12.423 --> 34:15.092
My gosh. Soldiers will be soldiers.

34:16.622 --> 34:17.762
Let's see.

34:20.903 --> 34:22.332
Gosh...

34:26.303 --> 34:27.503
Nice.

34:28.472 --> 34:30.642
When can I start at Law and One?

34:33.312 --> 34:35.483
You don't mind letting the five years go to waste?

34:36.312 --> 34:37.912
You just became a star.

34:45.892 --> 34:49.662
Do you remember what you said to me five years ago?

34:50.863 --> 34:53.292
That I must put aside all resentment or aspiration...

34:53.292 --> 34:54.733
toward the army.

34:55.633 --> 34:57.503
Yes. So which is it?

34:58.173 --> 34:59.403
It's neither.

35:00.233 --> 35:03.713
I only like the smell of cash.

35:05.573 --> 35:08.042
Money is nothing once you have enough of it.

35:08.843 --> 35:12.613
How about gaining immense power?

35:13.513 --> 35:14.522
Immense...

35:15.283 --> 35:17.022
(Chairman No Tae Nam)

35:21.492 --> 35:22.522
Hello, sir.

35:23.022 --> 35:25.593
You did me a favor. We should meet.

35:25.992 --> 35:27.533
I'll come to your office now.

35:27.533 --> 35:31.202
Not there. Come to Cartel. We should celebrate.

35:31.633 --> 35:32.702
Sure.

35:38.042 --> 35:39.142
Gosh.

35:39.472 --> 35:43.113
I'd love to know whom you speak so politely to.

35:43.983 --> 35:45.452
Can I meet the person?

35:46.582 --> 35:47.783
It's not yet time.

35:51.852 --> 35:53.963
Oh, right. I get it.

35:54.622 --> 35:57.193
Just be careful not to choke on...

35:57.193 --> 35:59.432
the feast I have laid out for you.

36:02.432 --> 36:05.673
That reminds me. My job should be waiting for me...

36:05.932 --> 36:07.843
not a day past the one you promised.

36:08.742 --> 36:09.872
Then...

36:16.242 --> 36:20.653
(No Tae Nam)

36:20.753 --> 36:23.153
Hey. Hold on.

36:23.753 --> 36:25.122
He made chairman when he's younger than me?

36:25.892 --> 36:28.292
"A known dog lover."

36:28.292 --> 36:30.323
"An in-house vet and a chef specializing in dog food..."

36:30.323 --> 36:31.932
Unbelievable.

36:32.562 --> 36:34.832
Here I am being jealous of a dog.

36:35.363 --> 36:37.702
- What are you reading? - Oh.

36:38.803 --> 36:41.372
I finally found out who is pulling Yong Moon Gu's strings.

36:41.472 --> 36:43.812
Really? Who could it be?

36:44.272 --> 36:45.742
IM Defense,

36:46.513 --> 36:47.682
Chairman No Tae Nam.

36:47.682 --> 36:49.042
("Young CEOs Are Taking Over: Chairman No Tae Nam of IM Defense")

37:04.562 --> 37:05.932
Are you kidding me?

37:05.932 --> 37:08.062
Hey. Who let the dog off its leash?

37:08.363 --> 37:09.533
Tie him up...

37:09.633 --> 37:11.173
or you'll see blood.

37:12.832 --> 37:13.943
Let's go.

37:23.082 --> 37:27.153
You. If someone requested that you tie your child up...

37:27.622 --> 37:30.352
just because he ruined your night,

37:30.952 --> 37:33.053
would you apologize with a bow...

37:34.093 --> 37:35.423
and oblige?

37:37.292 --> 37:40.162
Darn punk. What are you mumbling about?

37:41.363 --> 37:42.432
Answer me.

37:44.033 --> 37:46.832
Oh. Is that your dog?

37:50.173 --> 37:51.713
You psycho.

37:52.343 --> 37:54.983
Who lets a dog run around inside a club?

38:09.892 --> 38:10.992
I'll ask you again.

38:11.792 --> 38:15.332
If someone requested that you kill your child...

38:15.332 --> 38:17.303
just because he ruined your night,

38:18.372 --> 38:19.472
would you oblige?

38:21.242 --> 38:22.843
Well, I...

38:23.372 --> 38:25.412
A dog was running around inside the club, and I...

38:25.412 --> 38:27.542
Answer me. Would you kill your own child?

38:30.142 --> 38:31.412
I apologize.

38:33.812 --> 38:36.783
Hold on. I'm not the one you should apologize to.

38:36.952 --> 38:38.792
It's my bolt whose feelings were hurt.

38:39.253 --> 38:40.622
Bolt?

38:49.403 --> 38:50.463
Apologize.

38:55.702 --> 38:56.872
What?

38:58.772 --> 39:00.812
- Do it. - Darn.

39:02.182 --> 39:03.312
I'm sorry.

39:07.823 --> 39:10.352
When apologizing,

39:10.852 --> 39:13.852
you should lock eyes with whom you're apologizing to...

39:14.463 --> 39:16.622
and wait for his forgiveness.

39:25.303 --> 39:26.472
Throw him out.

39:29.872 --> 39:31.113
Almost forgot.

39:32.872 --> 39:34.142
On a leash.

39:40.253 --> 39:42.122
I'll clean this up first.

39:43.582 --> 39:45.122
Sure. Whatever.

39:59.202 --> 40:01.943
Let's party!

40:07.983 --> 40:11.082
The bank president's son must feel gravely wronged.

40:12.213 --> 40:14.283
He was sent to a military prison when he's innocent.

40:14.622 --> 40:16.682
He admitted to all the accusations being true...

40:16.883 --> 40:18.722
to save his father's reputation.

40:18.892 --> 40:21.062
Doesn't that military prosecutor have a guilty conscience?

40:21.522 --> 40:23.792
I get that he was following your orders,

40:24.233 --> 40:26.463
but he's more of a soldier than he is a prosecutor.

40:26.693 --> 40:28.102
An obedient soldier who follows orders.

40:29.033 --> 40:31.303
It depends on how I utilize him.

40:31.803 --> 40:33.733
That's only what you think.

40:35.102 --> 40:37.343
It's hard to know what the man's thinking.

40:38.073 --> 40:40.883
That may be true, but this I know for sure.

40:41.713 --> 40:43.412
What he's loyal to is money.

40:49.852 --> 40:52.522
Moon Gu, you still have a long way to go.

40:53.892 --> 40:56.763
Only the old-fashioned motivate people with materialism.

40:58.562 --> 41:02.303
There's no one in this world whose loyalty lies with money.

41:02.863 --> 41:04.173
People...

41:05.403 --> 41:07.272
should be loyal to people.

41:17.412 --> 41:19.053
What's this? I didn't know you had a guest.

41:19.812 --> 41:20.923
It's your lawyer.

41:21.582 --> 41:23.022
- Hello. - Right.

41:23.452 --> 41:25.693
- Have a seat. - Hello.

41:28.693 --> 41:30.992
You can leave us now, Mr. Yong.

41:31.992 --> 41:33.662
We're going to drink and party, you see.

41:34.062 --> 41:35.763
You will only kill the mood.

41:36.503 --> 41:38.372
I was about to now that the debrief is over.

41:41.102 --> 41:43.343
I'd like to meet that military prosecutor sometime.

41:43.872 --> 41:45.173
I will set it up.

41:45.372 --> 41:46.912
No, not like that.

41:47.372 --> 41:48.642
Just him and me.

41:50.713 --> 41:51.952
A private meeting.

41:55.122 --> 41:56.622
Right. Of course.

42:19.412 --> 42:20.472
(Order)

42:21.613 --> 42:23.142
Hey. Over here.

42:26.082 --> 42:27.253
Why did you ask for me here?

42:27.883 --> 42:29.352
Is there more to add to your statement?

42:31.952 --> 42:33.923
(Order)

42:34.022 --> 42:37.562
Why must I be locked up for a crime I didn't commit?

42:38.792 --> 42:42.363
Come on. Is that seriously what you called me here to ask?

42:43.233 --> 42:45.332
- I have nothing more to say. - No, please.

42:45.573 --> 42:47.642
A military prosecutor shouldn't fabricate evidence...

42:47.642 --> 42:49.303
and put an innocent man in prison.

42:49.972 --> 42:52.472
You should be ashamed of your title.

42:56.082 --> 42:58.153
(Order)

42:58.153 --> 42:59.452
- Is that eating you up? - Yes.

43:01.122 --> 43:02.253
The fact that I was wrongfully accused...

43:02.253 --> 43:03.753
is driving me crazy.

43:05.122 --> 43:06.292
Have you already forgotten?

43:06.792 --> 43:08.823
You don't have the right to feel that way.

43:10.863 --> 43:12.292
I guess you know now...

43:12.792 --> 43:16.303
just how much you wronged the guy you beat to death.

43:23.443 --> 43:24.812
Jung Min, film it for me.

43:26.742 --> 43:27.912
Make sure you get it good.

43:32.783 --> 43:35.022
Hey. Do you feel wronged?

43:35.122 --> 43:37.722
It's actually your fault...

43:37.992 --> 43:40.323
for not having better parents.

43:41.222 --> 43:44.792
Your dignity wouldn't have had to be dragged through the mud.

43:46.093 --> 43:47.562
Are you guys seeing this jerk?

43:49.633 --> 43:50.863
What a joke.

43:52.272 --> 43:54.972
Did you think that changing your name...

43:54.972 --> 43:56.573
having model behavior as a soldier...

43:57.173 --> 43:59.213
would clear you from being the murderer and bully you are?

44:00.242 --> 44:03.542
Life isn't that easy, my friend.

44:03.542 --> 44:05.783
What does that have to do with this?

44:08.122 --> 44:11.923
There we go. You're finally showing your true face.

44:12.792 --> 44:14.263
It must've been a hassle...

44:14.263 --> 44:16.062
trying to hide your true colors while serving in the military.

44:17.062 --> 44:20.062
You ruined my life overnight...

44:20.763 --> 44:23.932
and now you're acting like some apostle of justice.

44:24.102 --> 44:25.202
Justice?

44:27.903 --> 44:29.673
That's not what I'd associate myself with.

44:30.742 --> 44:33.142
But I guess it lessens the burden on my guilty conscience.

44:33.142 --> 44:34.582
You jerk!

44:36.113 --> 44:37.312
By the looks of it,

44:37.613 --> 44:39.682
it seems like you and I will meet down the road.

44:41.182 --> 44:42.352
I'll see you around.

45:11.550 --> 45:14.009
Hey, I'm going to leave.

45:16.550 --> 45:19.550
Make yourself comfortable. He's a really good guy.

45:20.090 --> 45:21.989
I just came out to grab a coffee.

45:21.989 --> 45:24.389
I didn't know I was coming to a place like this. Sorry.

45:25.259 --> 45:26.790
What's wrong with you?

45:26.929 --> 45:29.259
Everyone else lines up to get in here.

45:29.559 --> 45:31.199
I'm going to go.

45:32.730 --> 45:34.130
If you don't want to drink,

45:35.969 --> 45:37.270
want me to order you coffee?

45:37.909 --> 45:40.509
I made the effort of setting everything up nicely.

45:40.840 --> 45:43.579
You should have at least one drink for my sake.

45:43.940 --> 45:46.909
He's right. You're making me look bad.

45:47.110 --> 45:48.849
Have just one drink.

45:49.520 --> 45:51.790
- Just one drink. - Bring a cup of coffee.

46:09.800 --> 46:11.610
Do you want to pet Bolt?

46:11.969 --> 46:13.469
Bolt, go.

46:32.690 --> 46:35.659
How do you two know each other?

46:37.300 --> 46:40.199
I've been Alan's fan ever since he was a trainee.

46:41.170 --> 46:44.139
I was so happy when he messaged me first.

46:44.369 --> 46:46.869
Why are you telling him that? That's so embarrassing.

46:47.440 --> 46:48.980
Here. Drink.

47:09.730 --> 47:10.960
Goodness.

47:13.770 --> 47:14.869
Salute!

47:16.770 --> 47:17.940
Let's see.

47:20.009 --> 47:21.239
(Can coffee)

47:21.710 --> 47:23.880
- Stay awake. - Yes, ma'am.

47:24.440 --> 47:25.509
Thank you, ma'am.

47:26.509 --> 47:28.949
Oh my gosh. Hold on.

47:29.420 --> 47:30.619
Are you okay?

47:31.250 --> 47:33.650
It's okay.

47:35.590 --> 47:39.230
You're an officer. Do you still haze newcomers?

47:39.230 --> 47:41.960
That sergeant isn't in any condition to be interrogated.

47:42.230 --> 47:43.829
Like you didn't do it?

47:44.130 --> 47:47.230
When Section Chief Ahn first came, did you or did you not haze her?

47:47.570 --> 47:49.739
He made me go to crime scenes and smell the corpses...

47:49.739 --> 47:50.969
and made me search the forest...

47:50.969 --> 47:53.340
for three days and nights looking for hair.

47:53.570 --> 47:56.179
Hey. When did I do that?

47:56.179 --> 47:57.639
You did.

47:57.710 --> 47:59.909
Whenever I think about that smell...

48:02.550 --> 48:05.250
- Sir. - Don't fake barf.

48:05.250 --> 48:08.320
- Sir. - That was for the investigation.

48:08.320 --> 48:11.059
It's thanks to my training that you've become...

48:11.290 --> 48:14.360
the best investigator.

48:14.759 --> 48:16.000
Thank you, sir.

48:16.099 --> 48:18.829
Sure. Let's be strong and do our best. Yes.

48:20.969 --> 48:22.869
Cha should be doing well with the interrogation...

48:25.110 --> 48:26.139
Hey.

48:29.309 --> 48:31.409
He got worked up while being questioned.

48:31.409 --> 48:34.579
Get away! Step aside. I said to get away!

48:36.449 --> 48:38.949
Stand back. I'll handle it.

48:38.949 --> 48:41.219
- Darn it. - Stay still.

48:41.219 --> 48:42.420
Stand back.

48:45.690 --> 48:47.130
Stand back.

48:50.099 --> 48:51.369
Put it down.

48:53.000 --> 48:54.869
I said to stand back!

49:17.420 --> 49:20.529
It was my fault. I'll accept any punishment.

49:22.630 --> 49:24.800
You remained calm even in that situation.

49:25.529 --> 49:26.599
Not bad.

49:28.040 --> 49:29.469
But you know...

49:33.040 --> 49:34.070
Yes, sir?

49:35.980 --> 49:37.040
Never mind.

49:37.610 --> 49:38.779
Darn it.

49:40.750 --> 49:44.079
Darn it.

50:03.670 --> 50:04.670
(Military Prosecutor, Captain Do Be Man)

50:05.040 --> 50:06.040
(Military Prosecutor, Captain Cha Woo In)

50:08.340 --> 50:10.579
(Military Prosecutor, Captain Do Be Man)

50:36.540 --> 50:38.570
I'm going to leave now.

50:41.210 --> 50:42.279
But...

50:43.040 --> 50:44.710
Good night.

50:44.880 --> 50:46.250
Okay, go on.

50:51.790 --> 50:53.050
Captain.

50:55.460 --> 50:57.920
What's wrong with you? You keep staring at me.

50:58.829 --> 51:01.159
Well, I was just...

51:01.659 --> 51:02.759
Captain.

51:03.300 --> 51:07.199
Anyway, didn't Cha seem strange earlier?

51:07.329 --> 51:10.500
Strange. She seemed strange. Okay.

51:10.869 --> 51:13.540
That's how most people start. That's right.

51:15.639 --> 51:17.440
It seemed strange to me.

51:17.980 --> 51:21.079
No. I can't think of the correct term.

51:21.650 --> 51:23.949
It's strange but not exactly.

51:24.550 --> 51:25.550
What is it?

51:27.550 --> 51:29.989
- What is that word? - It's love.

51:30.619 --> 51:34.690
My gosh. Your rock-hard heart has finally softened,

51:34.690 --> 51:37.559
and a flower is blooming.

51:39.000 --> 51:40.670
My gosh.

51:42.369 --> 51:44.099
Goodness. A flower is blooming.

51:49.279 --> 51:51.509
Would you like to have a drink with me?

51:53.579 --> 51:56.579
I'm sorry, but I have important plans for tonight.

51:58.520 --> 52:00.349
You must've been very startled earlier.

52:01.020 --> 52:03.559
It was because Captain Do made you interrogate him.

52:04.520 --> 52:06.259
That was why I wanted to buy you a drink.

52:06.790 --> 52:08.259
I'm sad as well.

52:08.259 --> 52:11.000
I wanted to chew him out like crazy today too.

52:14.429 --> 52:15.770
W-I?

52:16.340 --> 52:17.969
Are those your initials?

52:18.540 --> 52:20.809
Yes. It's for my first name.

52:21.170 --> 52:22.980
It's pretty. It looks good on you.

52:25.079 --> 52:27.550
I'll get going then. Get lots of rest.

53:03.679 --> 53:05.619
It's bothering me.

53:06.250 --> 53:07.520
There's something suspicious.

53:08.759 --> 53:10.719
Bring me Cha's personnel file.

53:11.020 --> 53:13.989
That's it. Love is in the air.

53:13.989 --> 53:16.699
You become curious about the other person.

53:16.699 --> 53:19.270
You want to go to the ends of the earth...

53:19.270 --> 53:21.770
to find out everything you can about them.

53:22.300 --> 53:23.440
Bring it now.

53:23.440 --> 53:26.739
You must differentiate between having a crush and stalking.

53:26.739 --> 53:29.639
They are quite different.

53:30.679 --> 53:31.779
Keep going.

53:32.349 --> 53:34.309
- I'll go. - Continue.

53:34.309 --> 53:36.949
It's okay. Why do your muscles keep getting bigger?

53:37.480 --> 53:39.719
That punk. I've been too soft on him.

53:47.529 --> 53:50.429
It's your turn. Come play.

54:03.040 --> 54:04.540
What happened to your face?

54:04.639 --> 54:05.909
Just play.

54:07.250 --> 54:08.719
Don't tell me...

54:08.719 --> 54:11.179
Did you film a new video at Cartel?

54:11.619 --> 54:13.119
As if.

54:13.119 --> 54:15.320
I'm right. I am.

54:15.559 --> 54:17.820
Hey, it has been so long.

54:17.820 --> 54:20.960
Hey. Share it in the group chat stat,

54:21.329 --> 54:22.829
or you'll be kicked out.

54:22.929 --> 54:25.969
It's nothing like that, so leave me alone.

54:25.969 --> 54:27.300
Seriously.

54:27.300 --> 54:31.070
Look at him. He's trying to hide it. It must be really hot.

54:31.440 --> 54:32.869
Send it now.

54:32.869 --> 54:33.909
Darn it.

54:37.210 --> 54:38.239
Who is it?

54:44.480 --> 54:47.090
Darn it. I said no girls!

54:48.360 --> 54:49.559
It's a girl?

54:49.659 --> 54:51.929
- It's a girl? - Who called her?

54:51.929 --> 54:53.230
Who cares?

54:54.889 --> 54:56.829
Wow, she looks awesome.

54:58.159 --> 55:00.000
You moron.

55:06.644 --> 55:07.773
Who are you?

55:08.713 --> 55:12.054
Hello. Chairman No Tae Nam sent me.

55:13.114 --> 55:15.653
How do you know Tae Nam? He never mentioned you.

55:15.753 --> 55:19.324
He paid me the usual rate plus a huge tip.

55:21.423 --> 55:22.594
Did he?

55:23.463 --> 55:25.563
I guess you can come in.

55:34.074 --> 55:35.204
Hello.

55:39.873 --> 55:41.614
Tae Nam has his ups and downs.

55:42.483 --> 55:46.153
I think he let his emotions go wild and went too far again.

55:48.454 --> 55:51.894
He really can't give out this location.

55:51.894 --> 55:53.324
What's going on?

55:54.423 --> 55:56.664
You came here voluntarily.

55:56.664 --> 55:58.164
Change your mind later, and I'll kill you.

55:59.193 --> 56:02.003
I did come here voluntarily, punk.

56:03.764 --> 56:05.003
Why the sudden change of tone?

56:08.804 --> 56:11.204
Are you the impatient type?

56:11.474 --> 56:12.514
Yes.

56:14.173 --> 56:16.144
I'll get straight to the point.

56:19.753 --> 56:21.653
She needs eight weeks to heal.

56:22.284 --> 56:23.583
Who do you mean?

56:23.583 --> 56:24.753
Se Na.

56:25.594 --> 56:28.423
What you and No Tae Nam did to her in Cartel.

56:28.824 --> 56:30.423
Assault and rape. Eight weeks!

56:30.594 --> 56:32.764
The psychotherapy will last way longer than eight weeks.

56:33.094 --> 56:34.494
Possibly forever.

56:37.664 --> 56:38.833
Who are you?

56:41.233 --> 56:42.943
You drugged her to oblivion,

56:42.943 --> 56:44.304
filmed it all with your phone,

56:44.403 --> 56:46.244
and shared it with others.

56:47.213 --> 56:49.483
Hand over the phone unless you want to die.

56:49.983 --> 56:52.454
You're all nothing but maggots.

57:15.744 --> 57:17.003
You're plucky.

57:18.103 --> 57:19.414
You came on your own.

57:20.914 --> 57:24.014
Yes. I knew verbal threats wouldn't work on you.

57:24.914 --> 57:27.014
I'm not here just to talk either.

57:28.184 --> 57:29.884
I see.

57:31.583 --> 57:33.653
She graduated from high school in California...

57:33.653 --> 57:36.594
and got into Stanford Law School but dropped out.

57:37.293 --> 57:39.833
There's nothing on her for the next three years,

57:39.833 --> 57:42.233
but then she passes the bar exam in Korea.

57:45.574 --> 57:47.934
Darn it! You're one lucky broad!

57:48.204 --> 57:49.474
And you're unlucky.

57:49.804 --> 57:52.474
The room is soundproof, and no one will hear you scream.

57:53.813 --> 57:56.114
No one here complains about our noise.

57:56.384 --> 57:57.713
You psycho!

58:09.594 --> 58:12.164
She has no experience...

58:12.164 --> 58:14.833
at any law firm or court.

58:28.483 --> 58:29.614
You darn...

58:41.324 --> 58:43.264
Hey, you little...

59:02.014 --> 59:03.684
But she's not cut out to be a soldier.

59:03.914 --> 59:06.313
She barely passed the fitness test.

59:07.153 --> 59:08.884
She's useless at anything physical.

59:09.923 --> 59:12.793
She doesn't even have a taekwondo license.

59:22.603 --> 59:23.764
Darn it.

59:26.773 --> 59:28.034
Fists under your chin.

59:29.304 --> 59:30.403
Elbows closer together.

59:30.943 --> 59:32.244
Pull your chin to your chest.

59:33.043 --> 59:34.244
That's it.

59:35.684 --> 59:37.043
I let my guard down.

59:44.184 --> 59:45.394
You...

1:00:06.744 --> 1:00:07.873
Get up.

1:00:10.443 --> 1:00:13.184
Stop whining and get up unless you want another beating.

1:00:19.793 --> 1:00:20.853
Hand over your phone.

1:00:22.224 --> 1:00:25.023
Tae Nam is involved, and he won't let this go.

1:00:28.034 --> 1:00:30.603
Can you handle No Tae Nam?

1:00:35.543 --> 1:00:36.844
That is...

1:00:37.974 --> 1:00:39.074
what I want.

1:01:01.833 --> 1:01:03.063
Cha Woo In.

1:01:03.804 --> 1:01:05.474
Why did she become a military prosecutor?

1:01:08.034 --> 1:01:10.003
Did you hear anything other than what's in here?

1:01:10.574 --> 1:01:12.644
I'm the hear-all and know-all.

1:01:12.813 --> 1:01:15.443
I called everyone and no one knew anything.

1:01:15.713 --> 1:01:19.414
She didn't mingle with any of her fellow trainees.

1:01:19.583 --> 1:01:20.713
Really?

1:01:21.414 --> 1:01:23.123
I don't think...

1:01:23.123 --> 1:01:26.594
this is one-sided love or stalking, so what is it?

1:01:26.594 --> 1:01:29.864
What is bothering you so much?

1:01:34.293 --> 1:01:36.264
Why would you do something like this?

1:01:36.634 --> 1:01:39.173
Why are you getting even weirder?

1:01:39.804 --> 1:01:42.574
This happened, and she didn't flinch.

1:01:45.873 --> 1:01:48.414
That is what got me interested.

1:01:49.313 --> 1:01:50.844
She pretended to be afraid.

1:02:04.923 --> 1:02:07.793
It's done. Come and clean up.

1:02:23.813 --> 1:02:27.414
If only I could turn back time.

1:02:28.923 --> 1:02:30.523
If only I could.

1:02:31.684 --> 1:02:35.123
If only I could return to that day.

1:02:41.394 --> 1:02:42.934
(Chairman Cha Ho Cheol)

1:02:49.844 --> 1:02:51.804
- Dad. - Yes?

1:02:51.873 --> 1:02:55.744
Why is your company called IM?

1:02:58.414 --> 1:03:01.083
It's because I named it after you.

1:03:02.054 --> 1:03:03.684
My name is Woo In.

1:03:04.153 --> 1:03:05.284
What?

1:03:06.954 --> 1:03:10.123
What are your English initials?

1:03:10.764 --> 1:03:13.364
W and I.

1:03:13.963 --> 1:03:17.664
That's right. Now have a look.

1:03:19.403 --> 1:03:21.403
Your initials are...

1:03:22.873 --> 1:03:25.244
W and...

1:03:28.673 --> 1:03:30.884
I. Right?

1:03:31.184 --> 1:03:32.853
- Yes. - Turn it upside-down.

1:03:36.423 --> 1:03:39.894
A world where justice and truth are turned upside-down.

1:03:41.293 --> 1:03:44.864
You must flip things around to see them properly.

1:03:46.693 --> 1:03:48.634
When I lost my father,

1:03:50.063 --> 1:03:51.634
I lost everything.

1:03:52.403 --> 1:03:54.704
(Military Prosecutor Doberman)

1:04:05.043 --> 1:04:08.213
What about Captain Cha are you suspicious of?

1:04:08.713 --> 1:04:09.983
Alan is missing.

1:04:09.983 --> 1:04:11.324
Ask that person to look into it.

1:04:11.324 --> 1:04:13.253
The soldier who took care of the spoiled sergeant.

1:04:13.324 --> 1:04:16.623
My fate sees No Tae Nam as the wave crashing toward me,

1:04:16.623 --> 1:04:18.224
and I will let myself sail with him.

1:04:18.224 --> 1:04:20.434
Do you want them to pay?

1:04:20.434 --> 1:04:21.833
That's your choice to make.

1:04:21.833 --> 1:04:24.164
Something happened that night at Cartel, right?

1:04:25.134 --> 1:04:26.574
I want Do Be Man dead.

1:04:26.634 --> 1:04:28.603
The road always appears behind me.

1:04:29.144 --> 1:04:31.273
Like always, I will pave my own path.
