WEBVTT

00:01.302 --> 00:03.410
Previously on...
Why don't I just marry you?

00:03.434 --> 00:05.087
I've got
a fantastic health plan.

00:05.111 --> 00:06.653
You'd be covered instantly.

00:06.677 --> 00:09.586
Susan got an offer
she couldn't afford to refuse.

00:09.610 --> 00:12.119
You've had too much to drink.
Give me your keys.

00:12.143 --> 00:14.621
Bree rejected a helping hand.

00:14.645 --> 00:16.623
I want to have a baby with you.

00:16.647 --> 00:19.366
Gaby gave Carlos the answer
he'd been waiting for.

00:19.390 --> 00:21.268
You're my second a-b negative
today.

00:21.292 --> 00:23.600
Oh, who is it? That guy.

00:23.624 --> 00:27.404
And Zach began to put
"a" and "b" together.

00:30.661 --> 00:33.040
Susan Mayer had always believed

00:33.064 --> 00:36.683
the punishment
should fit the crime.

00:36.707 --> 00:39.086
She first
came to this conclusion

00:39.110 --> 00:41.348
when she discovered
her husband Karl

00:41.372 --> 00:43.150
had been unfaithful.

00:43.174 --> 00:49.054
Since Karl had destroyed
the love she had given him...

00:52.052 --> 00:54.531
She felt it was appropriate

00:54.555 --> 01:00.467
she destroy the things
he loved in return...

01:00.491 --> 01:03.370
One by one.

01:05.096 --> 01:07.444
But now, three years
after their divorce,

01:07.468 --> 01:11.047
Susan was reunited with Karl
once again...

01:11.071 --> 01:13.280
Susan, are you listening to me?

01:13.304 --> 01:16.123
As partners
in a crime of their own.

01:16.147 --> 01:18.385
This is insurance fraud.
We could both go to jail.

01:18.409 --> 01:20.627
Now we can't tellanyone
we're getting married.

01:20.651 --> 01:22.629
I know. I was listening to you.

01:22.653 --> 01:24.491
Now the prenup's all set.

01:24.515 --> 01:26.493
You can sign it
at the courthouse.

01:26.517 --> 01:28.165
11:30, Wednesday morning. Right?

01:28.189 --> 01:30.167
Right. And your surgery's
still on for Thursday?

01:30.191 --> 01:33.500
Yep. Good. The insurance
kicks in the minute we say "I do."

01:33.524 --> 01:35.242
You're set to go.

01:35.266 --> 01:38.345
I know no one's asking me,
but I think this whole thing

01:38.369 --> 01:39.846
is a tragic mistake,

01:39.870 --> 01:42.649
and I just don't have it in me
to survive another ugly divorce.

01:42.673 --> 01:44.181
Don't worry, honey.

01:44.205 --> 01:46.783
This time, it is strictly a
business arrangement. It better be,

01:46.807 --> 01:49.186
'cause if I see so much
as one lingering gaze

01:49.210 --> 01:51.188
between the two of you,
I swear I'll go

01:51.212 --> 01:53.190
to the insurance company
and turn you in.

01:53.214 --> 01:56.163
So we shouldn't expect
a wedding gift, huh?

01:56.187 --> 01:58.525
Oh, can you grab me
your wedding ring?

01:58.549 --> 02:00.797
I wanna get it cleaned
before the ceremony.

02:00.821 --> 02:04.100
Uh... is that really necessary?

02:04.124 --> 02:07.108
I mean, do we have to do
the whole ring thing?

02:07.132 --> 02:09.136
Of course we do.
It's gotta look believable.

02:09.160 --> 02:10.737
Yeah, okay.

02:10.761 --> 02:13.740
Well, I'll just grab something
out of my jewelry box.

02:13.764 --> 02:15.821
Susan, that ring
was my grandmother's.

02:15.845 --> 02:19.246
One day it's gonna be Julie's.
Where is it?

02:19.270 --> 02:22.149
I don't know...

02:22.173 --> 02:23.190
Exactly.

02:23.214 --> 02:26.358
That was a family heirloom.
I trusted you with it.

02:26.382 --> 02:29.896
Well, I trusted you not to
cheat on me and break my heart.

02:29.920 --> 02:32.629
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
What... what did you do with it?

02:32.653 --> 02:35.210
I threw it out my car window
somewhere on route 7.

02:35.234 --> 02:37.404
What?! When?

02:37.428 --> 02:39.236
The night you abandoned me.

02:39.260 --> 02:40.607
Suz...

02:40.631 --> 02:42.609
Karl, you aresonot allowed
to get angry.

02:42.633 --> 02:45.312
I mean, I might've been the one
to throw away the wedding ring,

02:45.336 --> 02:46.873
but you threw away
the whole marriage.

02:46.897 --> 02:49.816
There was plenty of bad behavior
that went on back then,

02:49.840 --> 02:51.648
so just get off your high horse.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.650
We're on the same page now,

02:53.674 --> 02:56.684
so we should just focus on that.

03:01.382 --> 03:04.691
Yes, Susan Mayer
believed the punishment

03:04.715 --> 03:06.233
should fit the crime.

03:06.257 --> 03:09.396
Karl, I think
there might be snakes in here.

03:09.420 --> 03:13.400
We're not leaving here
until you find that ring.

03:13.424 --> 03:21.424
But for that matter,
so did Karl.

03:29.540 --> 03:33.820
It was a tradition
at Leonardo's bar and grill,

03:33.844 --> 03:37.301
an hour before closing time,
a waiter would sing a selection

03:37.325 --> 03:40.697
of ridiculously depressing
Italian arias.

03:40.721 --> 03:43.300
It was also a tradition

03:43.324 --> 03:45.781
that the only customers
who would actually listen

03:45.805 --> 03:49.526
were the ones already depressed
to begin with.

03:54.405 --> 03:56.212
Tony?

03:56.236 --> 03:58.415
Do you have to rush off?

03:58.439 --> 04:02.389
I thought maybe we could
just chat for a minute.

04:02.413 --> 04:04.991
So I haven't seen you
in a while.

04:05.015 --> 04:08.325
Well, I didn't wanna come here
because I was afraid

04:08.349 --> 04:10.657
it would drudge up memories
of my husband.

04:10.681 --> 04:13.460
You know, this was our place.

04:13.484 --> 04:15.602
Rex passed away recently.

04:15.626 --> 04:20.406
He was, um, murdered
by our pharmacist.

04:20.430 --> 04:23.340
Wow.

04:23.364 --> 04:25.321
I hope you changed pharmacists.

04:25.345 --> 04:29.276
I didn't have to.
He committed suicide.

04:29.300 --> 04:31.678
Look, you've had
a little too much wine tonight.

04:31.702 --> 04:33.680
How about I call you a cab?

04:33.704 --> 04:35.852
Oh, no, no, no, no. I'm okay.

04:35.876 --> 04:37.854
Your car would be safe
in our lot,

04:37.878 --> 04:42.359
and you can pick it up
tomorrow. Please.

04:42.383 --> 04:43.560
Well, okay.

04:43.584 --> 04:45.362
♪♪♪

04:45.386 --> 04:47.634
Tony?

04:47.658 --> 04:50.337
How many more arias
is he gonna sing?

04:50.361 --> 04:51.398
Five.

04:51.422 --> 04:52.999
Oh. In that case,

04:53.023 --> 04:55.010
why don't you bring me
another bottle

04:55.034 --> 04:56.573
of the Pinot grigio?

04:58.599 --> 05:01.529
And please hurry.

05:48.078 --> 05:49.778
Bree?

05:51.482 --> 05:54.501
Bree. You okay?

05:54.525 --> 05:56.085
Ugh.

05:59.890 --> 06:01.738
Yes?

06:01.762 --> 06:05.472
Hi. Uh, did you know your mother
is asleep on the lawn?

06:07.938 --> 06:10.698
Oh, wow.

06:12.943 --> 06:15.630
Yeah, well, you don't seem
terribly shocked.

06:15.654 --> 06:19.025
Oh, it's, um...
It's just, mom drinks,

06:19.049 --> 06:22.058
and sometimes she sleeps it off
in the weirdest places.

06:22.082 --> 06:24.090
Can I help you with her?

06:24.114 --> 06:26.433
No. No, it's okay.

06:26.457 --> 06:28.935
I, uh, I know how
to take care of her.

06:28.959 --> 06:31.489
Well, good luck to you then.

06:50.441 --> 06:52.459
I wanna play "chopsticks."
Me too.

06:52.483 --> 06:53.960
You okay?

06:53.984 --> 06:55.792
I'm coming!

06:58.689 --> 06:59.666
Hi. Hi.

06:59.690 --> 07:00.867
Your kids...

07:00.891 --> 07:02.869
They have any allergies
I should know about?

07:02.893 --> 07:04.871
Uh, not that I know of. Why?

07:04.895 --> 07:06.873
'Cause I'm watching them.

07:06.897 --> 07:08.875
Tom called,
said you both got pulled

07:08.899 --> 07:12.509
into work for the weekend,
asked me to baby-sit. Really?

07:12.533 --> 07:14.986
I thought it'd be nice
if I gave 'em back to you alive.

07:15.010 --> 07:16.983
Oh, hey,
Mrs. McCluskey.

07:17.007 --> 07:18.545
Hi. Sorry, I forgot to tell you.

07:18.569 --> 07:20.947
Oh, that's okay. Um...

07:20.971 --> 07:24.658
Would you excuse me just
for a second? I have a... thing.

07:24.682 --> 07:26.175
Sure. Thanks.

07:27.718 --> 07:30.218
Follow me.
You're part of the thing.

07:34.885 --> 07:36.863
A million teenagers
in this neighborhood,

07:36.887 --> 07:39.466
and you hire McCluskey?
What's the big deal?

07:39.490 --> 07:41.207
Well, for starters,
she's ancient!

07:41.231 --> 07:43.439
Shh!
This is a thin door!

07:43.463 --> 07:45.942
It was not that long ago
that she keeled over

07:45.966 --> 07:47.844
in her front yard. A day with
our kids will finish the job.

07:47.868 --> 07:49.576
It's only for a few hours.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.548
Plus, Parker's on a play date
with the farrells,

07:51.572 --> 07:53.780
so it's just
the twins and penny.

07:53.804 --> 07:56.182
Justthe twins and penny?

07:56.206 --> 07:58.454
Okay, that was stupid.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.456
Let me try that another way.

08:00.480 --> 08:03.560
We have to be at work
in one hour.

08:03.584 --> 08:05.567
There's no day care
on the weekends,

08:05.591 --> 08:07.734
so you cut McCluskey loose,
we'restuck.

08:07.758 --> 08:09.235
We will find someone...

08:09.259 --> 08:11.738
Someone who doesn't remember
what they were doing

08:11.762 --> 08:13.670
the day Lincoln was shot.

08:13.694 --> 08:17.774
Fine. Let's go break the news.

08:17.798 --> 08:20.498
My wife has something
to tell you.

08:23.033 --> 08:24.911
So here's the deal.

08:24.935 --> 08:27.053
Um, there was
a little miscommunication,

08:27.077 --> 08:29.986
and as it turns out,
we don't need ya.

08:30.010 --> 08:34.490
Okay. Fine.
I'll just go back home.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.491
Okay. Sorry.

08:36.515 --> 08:39.596
By the way,
your husband was right.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.590
It's a thin door.

09:02.843 --> 09:06.653
Carlos, whatare you doing?

09:08.078 --> 09:10.957
Hello, Gabriela.

09:10.981 --> 09:12.659
Oh.

09:12.683 --> 09:14.323
Hi, mom.

09:22.833 --> 09:25.316
I just told Carlos
I justhadto take a shower.

09:25.340 --> 09:27.974
The man next to me on the plane
weighed 300 pounds,

09:27.998 --> 09:30.977
and he sweated all over me.
Ugh, it was so gross.

09:31.001 --> 09:32.979
No, I'm just surprised
you're here.

09:33.003 --> 09:34.681
It's Valentine's day.

09:34.705 --> 09:37.023
Don't you and Mr. Hedge fund
have plans?

09:37.047 --> 09:39.025
I know Carlos and I do.

09:39.049 --> 09:41.628
No, I left Charles.

09:41.652 --> 09:43.259
What? Mm-hmm.

09:43.283 --> 09:45.632
He was worth, like, $6 million.

09:45.656 --> 09:47.033
Money is not everything,
Gabriela.

09:47.057 --> 09:48.735
For some people,

09:48.759 --> 09:50.697
but we're talking
about you now, mother.

09:50.721 --> 09:52.699
You know, I can't believe this.

09:52.723 --> 09:54.706
I mean, I just went through
a terrible breakup,

09:54.730 --> 09:57.744
and the least you could do
is pretend to care.

09:57.768 --> 10:01.678
Well, of course we feel awful
about it, don't we, Gabrielle?

10:01.702 --> 10:04.110
Yeah, we're just sick about it.

10:04.134 --> 10:07.654
Well, don't worry about me.
Mm-hmm. I'll be okay.

10:07.678 --> 10:10.757
In fact, I bought myself
a little gift

10:10.781 --> 10:12.989
to take my mind off my problems.

10:13.013 --> 10:14.700
Really? What did you buy?

10:14.724 --> 10:16.362
New boobs!

10:16.386 --> 10:17.363
Whoa!

10:17.387 --> 10:18.625
No peeking, Carlos.

10:18.649 --> 10:20.627
Okay, mom, put these away!

10:20.651 --> 10:22.629
My plastic surgeon
gave me a great deal.

10:22.653 --> 10:24.070
Aren't they fun?

10:25.756 --> 10:26.926
Bye, Carlos.

10:31.331 --> 10:33.810
What? I think she's charming.

10:33.834 --> 10:36.643
Okay, you can think
she's charming.

10:36.667 --> 10:39.916
But don't forget for one second
thatsheis a monster.

10:43.874 --> 10:46.061
Did you get the gum out
from under the diamond?

10:46.085 --> 10:47.153
Mostly.

10:47.177 --> 10:48.995
Morning.

10:49.019 --> 10:51.719
Hi! Happy Valentine's day.

10:52.753 --> 10:55.802
Dr. Ron,
did you spend the night?

10:55.826 --> 10:58.905
Well, uh, yeah, I got
kinda tired after the movie,

10:58.929 --> 11:01.637
so I asked... it's okay. She
knows that you make house calls.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.940
Oh. Um, so listen,
I've got surgery till 6.

11:03.964 --> 11:06.778
I'll get dressed and I'll pick
you up at about 7.

11:06.802 --> 11:09.816
We have reservations at chez
Naomi. Great! I'll have a light lunch.

11:09.840 --> 11:11.818
And also, Dr. Cunningham's
schedule opened up,

11:11.842 --> 11:15.089
so if you'd like, we can move up
your surgery to Wednesday.

11:15.113 --> 11:18.324
Oh,
I have a wedding that day. On a Wednesday?

11:18.348 --> 11:20.787
Uh... yeah.

11:20.811 --> 11:24.660
Um, wednesdays are becoming
very popular with brides.

11:24.684 --> 11:27.041
It's like the new Saturday.

11:27.065 --> 11:29.035
Oh. Okay.

11:29.059 --> 11:31.037
Well...

11:31.061 --> 11:32.791
I'll see ya tonight. Bye.

11:37.267 --> 11:40.146
Your mother is
a rotten, sneaky person.

11:40.170 --> 11:44.010
Look, I'm not too crazy about
this whole fake marriage thing,

11:44.034 --> 11:47.361
but if you don't have
that operation, you could die.

11:47.385 --> 11:50.216
So don't be so hard on yourself.

11:50.240 --> 11:52.018
Youarea good person.

11:52.042 --> 11:55.291
Thanks, hon. That really helps.

11:55.315 --> 11:57.293
Okay, now I want you to go over

11:57.317 --> 11:59.295
and slip this ring
to your father.

11:59.319 --> 12:01.768
And just so you know,
if Edie catches you,

12:01.792 --> 12:04.222
I'm expecting you to swallow it.

12:08.428 --> 12:11.137
How's the hangover?

12:11.161 --> 12:14.941
I do not have a hangover,
Andrew, because I was not drunk.

12:16.406 --> 12:19.415
Then, uh... how about
a little hair of the dog?

12:19.439 --> 12:21.948
It'll perk you right up.

12:21.972 --> 12:24.050
Look, for the record,

12:24.074 --> 12:27.958
I had an allergic reaction
to my antihistamine medication,

12:27.982 --> 12:30.957
so I would appreciate
just a little bit of sympathy.

12:30.981 --> 12:34.000
Why can't you just drink alone
in your room like Tammy's mom?

12:34.024 --> 12:36.763
For god sakes,
it was an honest mistake.

12:36.787 --> 12:38.104
I thought I could have

12:38.128 --> 12:40.106
just a little bit of wine
with dinner,

12:40.130 --> 12:42.760
but, apparently,
my body couldn't handle it.

12:47.037 --> 12:48.344
Fine!

12:48.368 --> 12:50.977
If it makes everybody happy,
I will just suffer

12:51.001 --> 12:53.980
through my sneezing fits
and my hives on my own.

12:55.505 --> 12:56.953
There. Is that better?

12:56.977 --> 12:59.055
So basically
you would rather drink

12:59.079 --> 13:00.979
than to not have allergies?

13:07.787 --> 13:11.017
Hi. Is now a bad time?
I could really use a favor.

13:18.428 --> 13:20.376
She was beautiful, wasn't she?

13:20.400 --> 13:23.509
Yeah.

13:23.533 --> 13:26.043
Come on, sit down.
Your breakfast is getting cold.

13:36.116 --> 13:39.065
Was my real mother beautiful?

13:39.089 --> 13:43.930
Well, she was, uh,
attractive, as I recall.

13:43.954 --> 13:46.802
Do I look like her?

13:46.826 --> 13:50.406
I don't know.
I-I only met her once.

13:50.430 --> 13:52.909
Oh. Well, 'cause if
I don't look like her,

13:52.933 --> 13:55.373
then I might look like
my real dad.

13:58.568 --> 14:01.848
I'm getting real tired
of your morbid fascination

14:01.872 --> 14:06.122
with two strangers who didn't
love you enough to keep you.

14:06.146 --> 14:08.276
So, please,
stop asking about them.

14:10.380 --> 14:13.529
It's only natural that I'd wanna
talk about my birth parents.

14:13.553 --> 14:16.332
Well, it may be natural,

14:16.356 --> 14:18.334
but it certainly isn't polite.

14:22.993 --> 14:25.316
And once
your daughter was dead,

14:25.340 --> 14:27.413
they had to get rid
of her somehow.

14:27.437 --> 14:30.046
That's where
the toy chest came in.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.918
Flash forward 15 years,

14:31.942 --> 14:35.329
the chest washes up
on the shore of rockwater lake.

14:35.353 --> 14:38.254
Any forensic evidence
is long gone,

14:38.278 --> 14:40.586
and the youngs
get away with murder.

14:40.610 --> 14:43.559
Now, of course,
the wife, Mary Alice,

14:43.583 --> 14:46.162
is already dead, but...

14:46.186 --> 14:48.965
Paul young's a different matter.

14:48.989 --> 14:52.868
If you'd like me
to deal with him,

14:52.892 --> 14:55.942
just say the word.

14:55.966 --> 14:59.946
Delfino's bringing
my grandson here.

14:59.970 --> 15:03.009
I wanna get the kid something.

15:03.033 --> 15:05.543
You know anything
about those mp3 things?

15:07.978 --> 15:11.317
Yeah, they're real nice.
I'd go with that.

15:11.341 --> 15:15.992
Ah, he's probably
got one already.

15:16.016 --> 15:17.994
Paul young has had 16 years

15:18.018 --> 15:20.118
to get my grandkid
anything he wants.

15:22.522 --> 15:25.531
Do me a favor, will ya? Yeah.

15:25.555 --> 15:28.174
See to it that Paul young

15:28.198 --> 15:32.028
has a toy chest of his very own.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.597
Karl!

15:51.621 --> 15:55.001
Yeah? This
place is a freakin' pigsty.

15:55.025 --> 15:57.163
Would you get down here
and help me?

15:57.187 --> 15:59.405
All right, hold on,
it's almost halftime.

15:59.429 --> 16:01.307
By the way,
I made dinner reservations

16:01.331 --> 16:03.409

if that's okay.

16:03.433 --> 16:05.650
It's gotta be better
than that rathole

16:05.674 --> 16:08.044
you took me to on new year's.

16:08.068 --> 16:10.346
And don't eventhink
of getting me carnations again.

16:10.370 --> 16:13.019
That crap might have flown
for Mayer.

16:13.043 --> 16:15.030

17:19.108 --> 17:22.188
When I heard that you two
wanted to try for another child,

17:22.212 --> 17:23.489
I was delighted.

17:23.512 --> 17:26.122
But I had some cause
for concern.

17:26.146 --> 17:29.195
Gabrielle, you suffered
some extensive injuries

17:29.219 --> 17:30.496
during your fall last month,

17:30.520 --> 17:34.220
and the test confirmed
there are complications.

17:36.426 --> 17:38.164
You can't have kids?

Well, the doctor's not
100% positive,

17:40.290 --> 17:42.138
but it's very, very iffy.

17:42.162 --> 17:43.439
Carlos, I am so sorry.

17:43.463 --> 17:46.112
I know how much
you wanted to be a dad.

17:46.136 --> 17:47.413
Thanks.

17:47.437 --> 17:50.646
Don't be so suicidal.
We can always adopt.

17:50.670 --> 17:53.649
I wanted to have a child
of our own. You know that.

17:53.673 --> 17:55.621
What does it matter
whose d.N.A. It is?

17:55.645 --> 17:57.623
The diapers are still gonna
smell the same regardless.

17:57.647 --> 18:00.156
I'd just prefer
not to adopt. Okay?

18:00.180 --> 18:03.529
Fine. What about surrogacy?
I mean, I know it's pricey,

18:03.553 --> 18:06.332
but at least the baby
would look like us,

18:06.356 --> 18:08.334
and I wouldn't get
stretch marks. It's a win-win.

18:08.358 --> 18:11.267
Great. So then we have
some stranger off the street

18:11.291 --> 18:13.639
giving birth to our child.
Is that what you really want?

18:13.663 --> 18:15.550
What I want
is for you to lighten up.

18:15.574 --> 18:18.104
We don't have a lot of options,

18:18.128 --> 18:21.307

one. I-I have a thought. Mm?

Well, first of all,
let me tell you,

18:27.337 --> 18:29.485
that I am in the best shape
of my life.

18:29.509 --> 18:30.856
So?

18:30.880 --> 18:34.610
So... what if I was
your surrogate?

18:36.886 --> 18:39.125
Yeah, I know. I know
it might sound a little crazy,

18:39.149 --> 18:41.567
but I am the only one
in the world

18:41.591 --> 18:44.530
that you can trust
to put the baby's needs first.

I'll eat better...

Why?

18:50.730 --> 18:53.579
Off the top of my head,
you're on medicare?

18:53.603 --> 18:57.283
I am only fifty... one.

18:57.307 --> 18:59.645
You know, and there's this woman
in england last year.

18:59.669 --> 19:02.248
She was 63 years old,
and she gave birth

19:02.272 --> 19:03.589
to her own grandchild.

19:03.613 --> 19:06.260
Look, I don't care if she shot
triplets out of her ass.

england baby turn out?

a big head or anything, did it?

Carlos, you are not
seriously considering this.

19:19.359 --> 19:20.836
Well, think about it, Gaby.

19:20.860 --> 19:22.808
This way, the surrogate wouldn't
be some impersonal Incubator.

19:22.832 --> 19:26.202
There'd be a family tie.

19:27.497 --> 19:31.347
I have a migraine.
I'm gonna go lay down upstairs.

19:31.371 --> 19:32.848

this like rational human beings.

I have something to tell them.

21:12.872 --> 21:14.342
Ah.

21:19.278 --> 21:20.556
Have they signed the contract?

21:20.580 --> 21:22.558

somebody should call bednark

21:22.582 --> 21:24.660

language. Okay, I'll handle it.

21:58.418 --> 22:01.427
Oh, yes.
Oh, yeah, me too. Thank you.

22:01.451 --> 22:03.929
Because there are all sorts
of crazy people out there...

22:03.953 --> 22:06.632
Drunks, perverts, molesters.

22:06.656 --> 22:08.774
Yes! Yeah, no, I know.

22:08.798 --> 22:11.377
No! You got really lucky.

22:11.401 --> 22:13.639
I mean, a different person
might have called the cops

22:13.663 --> 22:15.080
or child welfare.

22:15.104 --> 22:17.087
Well, uh, okay,
I know how this looks,

22:17.111 --> 22:18.584
but I have to tell you,

22:18.608 --> 22:20.986
I left them with
a very reliable baby-sitter.

22:21.010 --> 22:24.470
Oh, yeah.
You picked a real winner.

22:25.675 --> 22:28.794
Are you judging me?
Because if you are,

22:28.818 --> 22:30.496
you couldn't say anything...
Lynette, Lynette!

22:30.520 --> 22:32.528
What?! Let it go.

22:32.552 --> 22:34.530
The kids walked
for 3 miles to get here.

22:34.554 --> 22:36.664
We don't have a leg to stand on.

22:38.428 --> 22:41.006
Well, thank you so much!

22:41.030 --> 22:42.830
Here we go.

22:47.997 --> 22:50.546
Hey... I don't know about you,

22:50.570 --> 22:53.048
but I am tired of all
the tension around here,

22:53.072 --> 22:56.486
so I was thinking we could
go shopping, have some fun.

22:56.510 --> 22:59.024
Then maybe later we can talk
about the surrogacy thing,

22:59.048 --> 23:01.527
see if we can make it work.

23:01.551 --> 23:02.688
Oh, Gabriela!

23:02.712 --> 23:04.790
Oh, you'll see...

23:04.814 --> 23:07.694
This is the best thing
for the entire family.

23:14.163 --> 23:16.402
So where's the boutique?

23:16.426 --> 23:18.844
Oh, it's in the hotel lobby.

23:18.868 --> 23:20.846
So go ahead,
I'm right behind ya.

23:20.870 --> 23:22.730
Okay.

23:30.810 --> 23:32.558
What are you doing?

23:32.582 --> 23:34.119
I'm going home.

23:34.143 --> 23:36.522
What?

23:36.546 --> 23:38.424
I thought
we were gonna talk about

23:38.448 --> 23:40.426
how the surrogacy will work.

23:40.450 --> 23:42.798
Here's how it's gonna work...
You're gonna check yourself

23:42.822 --> 23:45.431
into the hotel,
and then tomorrow,

23:45.455 --> 23:47.433
you're gonna plant your
childbearing hips on a plane,

23:47.457 --> 23:49.427
and you're gonna
leave our lives forever.

23:52.502 --> 23:54.602
I'm pulling out.
Watch your boobs.

24:07.577 --> 24:10.155
Come on out.

24:10.179 --> 24:13.999
Oh, thank god! I'm so sorry.
I don't know what happened.

24:14.023 --> 24:16.570
I was in the kitchen cleaning up
after making cookies,

24:16.594 --> 24:20.536
and I looked in the living room,
and they were gone.

24:20.560 --> 24:24.169
We tried to tell her we were
going, but she was asleep.

24:24.193 --> 24:25.671
You were sleeping?

24:25.695 --> 24:28.874
I most certainly was not.
Yes, you were.

24:28.898 --> 24:31.947
Okay, all right, that lie
just lost you another week

24:31.971 --> 24:35.450
of TV and video game privileges.

24:35.474 --> 24:37.558
That's two. You wanna
keep talking and lose more?

24:37.582 --> 24:39.525
Then apologize
to Mrs. Van De Kamp.

24:39.549 --> 24:41.627
Sorry.

24:41.651 --> 24:43.759
All right, go back in.
No... no harm done.

24:43.783 --> 24:45.761
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

24:45.785 --> 24:46.785
Ugh!

24:52.061 --> 24:54.540
Well, if you ask me, it's
a pretty crappy thing to do.

24:54.564 --> 24:57.047
Did you even slow the car down
before you pushed her out?

24:57.071 --> 24:59.044
Okay, first of all,
no one asked you.

24:59.068 --> 25:02.508
And the only reason you care
about my mother is because

25:02.532 --> 25:04.610
of that ridiculous suggestion
she offered. I think her offer

25:04.634 --> 25:08.191
to be our surrogate was very generous.
Generous? Don't you see the strings attached?

25:08.215 --> 25:10.485
What strings? The only reason

25:10.509 --> 25:12.858
she offered up her dusty womb
is because she's screwed.

25:12.882 --> 25:14.660
Her latest sugar daddy
gave her the boot,

25:14.684 --> 25:17.668
so mom needs a place to stay
and money. So trust me,

25:17.692 --> 25:20.966
if she carried our child, we'd
be footing the bill for years.

25:20.990 --> 25:24.199
I think your hatred for her
is clouding your judgment.

25:24.223 --> 25:27.033
Maybe, but you don't
know her like I do.

25:28.628 --> 25:30.505
Okay.

25:30.529 --> 25:33.008
You ran away from home
15 years ago.

25:33.032 --> 25:35.010
Did you ever think
to talk to her

25:35.034 --> 25:38.548
about the stuff that happened
between you and your stepdad?

25:38.572 --> 25:40.646
It wouldn't have done any good.

25:40.670 --> 25:43.048
How do you know that?

25:43.072 --> 25:44.720
Because...

25:44.744 --> 25:47.157
She knewexactlywhat
was going on with Alejandro,

25:47.181 --> 25:49.524
and shechose
to look the other way.

25:49.548 --> 25:51.857
But you never even gave her
a chance to step up.

25:51.881 --> 25:53.859
You just ran away from home.

25:53.883 --> 25:56.932
Because if I did, then she w...

25:56.956 --> 25:58.664
Because...

25:58.688 --> 26:01.306
There was a chance
she wouldn't have believed me,

26:01.330 --> 26:03.609
and... and that
would've hurt a lot worse

26:03.633 --> 26:05.943
than anything he ever did to me.

26:17.777 --> 26:20.107
She's your mother,
and she loves you.

26:22.251 --> 26:23.729
I know it's been
a very long time,

26:23.753 --> 26:26.763
but maybe you can
talk to her about it now.

26:33.663 --> 26:35.646
I'm getting her luggage
back to her,

26:35.670 --> 26:37.665
and that's the best I can do.

26:51.811 --> 26:53.689
What are you doing here?

26:53.713 --> 26:56.066
There's something I need
to talk to you about.

26:56.090 --> 26:58.694
It's important. There's
nothing for us to talk about.

26:58.718 --> 27:01.767
Shut up and listen.

27:01.791 --> 27:04.069
Dierdre's father, Noah Taylor,

27:04.093 --> 27:06.910
somehow found out about Zach,
and he wants to meet him.

27:06.934 --> 27:10.335
"Somehow found out"?
Like, maybe you told him?

27:10.359 --> 27:12.778
Noah is no friend of mine.

27:12.802 --> 27:15.816
But he's very rich and powerful,
and he's terminal,

27:15.840 --> 27:18.613
and he wants to meet
his grandson before he dies.

27:18.637 --> 27:20.816
Absolutely not.

27:20.840 --> 27:24.349
Well, you'll be surprised,
but I agree with you.

27:24.373 --> 27:26.697
Noah destroys
everything he touches,

27:26.721 --> 27:29.154
and the last thing
either of us wants

27:29.178 --> 27:32.778
is for this guy
to get his hooks into Zach.

27:36.655 --> 27:38.633
What are we supposed to do?

27:38.657 --> 27:41.937
You and Zach need to vanish.
Just stay out of sight

27:41.961 --> 27:44.661
until nature
takes its course with Noah.

27:46.665 --> 27:49.074
If we leave,
we won't be coming back.

27:49.098 --> 27:51.198
You'll never see your boy again.

27:53.873 --> 27:55.713
I know.

28:07.216 --> 28:10.095
Well, happy Valentine's day,
my darling.

28:10.119 --> 28:13.699
Isn't that your ex-husband?

28:13.723 --> 28:14.740
Oh, yeah.

28:16.425 --> 28:19.875
Oh, apparently,
they'll let anyone in here.

28:19.899 --> 28:22.207
Hi. Hmm.

28:22.231 --> 28:25.110
Your chocolate soufflés
will be out momentarily.

28:25.134 --> 28:27.082
Oh, we didn't order soufflé.

28:27.106 --> 28:29.084
I ordered
as soon as we got here.

28:29.108 --> 28:32.718
It takes an hour to prepare. Oh,
I really can't. I'm stuffed.

28:32.742 --> 28:35.020
No, no, no,
thisyou'll wanna try.

28:35.044 --> 28:38.063
It's their specialty.

28:38.087 --> 28:40.087
I guess I'll have the soufflé.

28:41.450 --> 28:43.428
Can you excuse me for a second?

28:43.452 --> 28:47.402
I, um... I just
have to powder my nose.

28:51.060 --> 28:53.208
I'm sorry to interrupt.

28:53.232 --> 28:55.949
Your makeup is all smudged.
Come with me. I'll fix it.

28:55.973 --> 28:57.943
What? Come on, get up.

28:57.967 --> 28:59.745
Sorry.

28:59.769 --> 29:02.317
My makeup is smudged?

29:02.341 --> 29:04.171
Get in here.

29:07.276 --> 29:10.076
I have some news that's
probably gonna devastate you.

29:11.350 --> 29:14.399
But I wanted to be
the first one to tell you.

29:14.423 --> 29:15.761
Okay.

29:15.785 --> 29:18.303
Karl is about
to pop the question.

29:18.327 --> 29:20.836
You mean, like, marriage?
Mm-hmm!

29:20.860 --> 29:23.769
Oh, I hope I haven't ruined
your Valentine's day.

29:23.793 --> 29:25.880
Do you want a tissue?
No, no. I'm okay.

29:25.904 --> 29:30.475
I-I'm just... surprised.
Uh, well, congratulations.

29:30.499 --> 29:34.249
Um, what makes you think
he's gonna propose?

29:34.273 --> 29:36.081
Well, I, um,

29:36.105 --> 29:38.784
I was looking through
his briefcase this afternoon,

29:38.808 --> 29:40.355
and I found this ring.

29:40.379 --> 29:43.388
And so tonight he keeps pushing
this "special dessert" on me,

29:43.412 --> 29:46.792
so obviously,
he's hidden the ring inside.

29:46.816 --> 29:48.834
A ring!

29:48.858 --> 29:50.836
What did it look like?

29:50.860 --> 29:52.337
Oh, I don't know.

29:52.361 --> 29:54.840
18-karat white gold,
10 diamonds, engraved accents.

29:54.864 --> 29:57.542
I just got a quick peek.

29:57.566 --> 30:00.045
Oh, um...
I think I know that ring.

30:00.069 --> 30:03.108
That's his grandmother's ring.
It's a family heirloom.

30:03.132 --> 30:04.810
And, you know,

30:04.834 --> 30:07.391
he might just be having it
cleaned or something.

30:07.415 --> 30:09.414
Except for one thing...

30:09.438 --> 30:12.787
Lying right next to it...

30:12.811 --> 30:14.860
Was a prenup!

30:14.884 --> 30:19.364
Oh. Well, Karl is a lawyer,

30:19.388 --> 30:24.429
and it could just be a prenup
for another client.

30:24.453 --> 30:29.104
Boy, jealousy is
one ugly thing up close.

30:29.128 --> 30:31.376
Oh, no, Edie...
No, you know what?

30:31.400 --> 30:33.839
I'm gonna take
the high road and...

30:33.863 --> 30:36.250
And I'm gonna ignore
your nastiness.

30:36.274 --> 30:40.245
If you'll excuse me,
I'm going back to my table

30:40.269 --> 30:42.039
and getting engaged.

30:44.313 --> 30:45.613
Ohh!

30:56.285 --> 30:59.965
Oh, hi. Um,
do you see that man over there?

30:59.989 --> 31:01.406
Dark hair, handsome.

31:01.430 --> 31:05.430
I need you to slip this to him
without anybody noticing.

31:14.003 --> 31:16.181
God, youneverstop.

31:16.205 --> 31:18.253
I told you,
I'm not divorcing my wife.

31:18.277 --> 31:20.255
I'm in this for the sex,

31:20.279 --> 31:23.028
and if you can't accept it,
then go to hell.

31:31.590 --> 31:35.470
What the hell are you doing?

31:35.494 --> 31:37.908
Well, I thought you said
this dessert was special.

31:37.932 --> 31:39.874
When you put it
in your mouth and eat it.

31:39.898 --> 31:41.898
What is wrong with you? Well...

31:44.573 --> 31:45.943
Nothing.

31:52.481 --> 31:55.991
Carlos, what a surprise.

31:56.015 --> 31:58.293
Come on in. I thought
you could use your bags.

31:58.317 --> 31:59.995
Oh, yes. The perfect timing.

32:00.019 --> 32:03.268
I just took a shower and needed
something to change into.

32:03.292 --> 32:05.270
Here, leave it here.
This is fine. Thank you.

32:05.294 --> 32:07.177
Listen, do you have a minute?

32:07.201 --> 32:09.674
Um, because I need to talk
to you about something.

32:09.698 --> 32:13.078
- Hmm, yeah, sure. Sit down.
- Talk as I dress.

32:13.102 --> 32:16.911
I'll leave the door open
so I can hear.

32:16.935 --> 32:20.915
Look, I was, uh, I was thinking
about your surrogacy idea.

32:20.939 --> 32:22.347
Mm-hmm?

32:22.371 --> 32:24.349
And I think
it could be the answer

32:24.373 --> 32:26.051
to all of our problems.

32:26.075 --> 32:28.053
That is,
if you're still interested.

32:28.077 --> 32:31.426
Yes! I mean, uh, I am.

32:31.450 --> 32:35.460
Buti-i just think that
Gaby will never let it happen.

32:35.484 --> 32:38.041
No, no. No, she can
be convinced. I know it.

32:38.065 --> 32:41.306
Can you please, uh,
zip me up? Huh?

32:41.330 --> 32:45.170
My zipper! It's stuck.

32:45.194 --> 32:47.604
Ahem.

32:48.737 --> 32:52.617
You did that so fast.

32:52.641 --> 32:56.051
I know someone who works out.

32:56.075 --> 33:01.956
As I was saying, I think
the surrogacy idea could work.

33:01.980 --> 33:04.059
Um...

33:04.083 --> 33:07.297
But you and Gaby are gonna
have to mend some fences.

33:07.321 --> 33:10.095
After such a long time,
what is the point?

33:10.119 --> 33:11.666
Lucia, please, hear me out.

33:11.690 --> 33:14.469
There was a lot of stuff
that Gaby went through

33:14.493 --> 33:15.970
when she was younger...

33:15.994 --> 33:19.044
A lot of stuff
that you don't know about.

33:19.068 --> 33:21.676
And I think that if you went
to her and asked her about it,

33:21.700 --> 33:24.279
then the two of you
could finally get past it.

33:24.303 --> 33:26.290
What stuff are you
talking about, Carlos?

33:26.314 --> 33:30.135
Your second husband,
Alejandro?

33:33.042 --> 33:36.161
When Gaby was 15,
he assaulted her sexually.

33:36.185 --> 33:38.423
Is that what she told you?

33:38.447 --> 33:41.496
Look, I know that
it comes as a shock for you

33:41.520 --> 33:43.498
to be hearing it from me...

33:43.522 --> 33:47.332
Carlos, please,
I am aware they had sex.

33:47.356 --> 33:50.275
But it was Gabriela
who seduced him.

33:50.299 --> 33:52.307
Excuse me?

33:52.331 --> 33:55.440
She was always jealous of me.

33:55.464 --> 33:58.648
You don't know how many times
I caught her wearing my shoes,

33:58.672 --> 34:00.145
trying on my jewelry...

34:00.169 --> 34:03.218
And I'd scream at her to leave
my things alone, but no,

34:03.242 --> 34:06.451
she wanted whatever I had.

34:06.475 --> 34:10.045
Then one night,
she set her sights on Alejandro.

34:11.550 --> 34:16.030
Believe me, no one got raped.

34:16.054 --> 34:20.264
Lucia,
she was only 15 years old.

34:20.289 --> 34:23.268
You know, a lot of men
have left me over the years,

34:23.292 --> 34:25.270
and I never knew the reason.

34:25.293 --> 34:29.373
But when Alejandro left, I knew
exactlywhy it happened.

34:29.398 --> 34:31.616
Gabriela made him
fall in love with her.

34:31.639 --> 34:35.139
Oh, it took me so many years
to forgive her.

34:36.605 --> 34:39.324
Youforgaveher?

34:39.348 --> 34:41.156
But of course.

34:41.179 --> 34:45.179
I couldn't have offered
to carry her baby unless I had.

34:52.321 --> 34:54.799
Karl. Karl!

34:54.822 --> 34:56.132
Come here!

35:00.329 --> 35:02.407
Why didn't you answer
your damn cell phone?

35:02.431 --> 35:04.179
I turned it off.
What's going on?

35:04.203 --> 35:06.211
Where's Edie? She's upstairs.

35:06.235 --> 35:09.384
She's been in a pissy mood ever
since we left the restaurant.

35:09.408 --> 35:12.387
I don't know what's wrong with her.
She found the ring and the prenup

35:12.411 --> 35:14.259
in your briefcase.
She thought you were gonna

35:14.283 --> 35:16.266
pop the question tonight.
Oh, no.

35:16.290 --> 35:19.093
Oh, yes. You know, this whole
fake marriage thing was okay

35:19.117 --> 35:21.095
when nobody was getting hurt.

35:21.119 --> 35:24.269
What are we doing? It's a lie!
I lost Mike over a lie,

35:24.293 --> 35:26.576
and now I'm doing
the same thing to Dr. Ron,

35:26.600 --> 35:28.603
and... and look at Edie.
She was devastated.

35:28.627 --> 35:33.138
I don't think I can go through with
this. You can't call off the wedding.

35:33.162 --> 35:35.440
How are you gonna pay for
your surgery? I don't know.

35:35.464 --> 35:38.148
You know, I'll just...
I'll sell the car.

35:38.172 --> 35:40.145
Susie, this is your health
we're talking about.

35:40.169 --> 35:41.846
We're getting married. Karl...

35:41.870 --> 35:43.848
No. Dr. Ron
would be the first to say

35:43.872 --> 35:45.850
that you're doing
the right thing.

35:45.874 --> 35:48.261
I'll figure out some way
to handle Edie.

35:48.285 --> 35:51.296
How? How are you
gonna handle Edie?

35:51.320 --> 35:53.758
That poor woman's dreams
exploded in her face tonight.

35:53.782 --> 35:56.401
You know, it's not like
you can just go out

35:56.425 --> 35:58.403
and buy her flowers,
and everything will be better.

35:58.427 --> 36:00.635
Then I'll propose to her.

36:00.659 --> 36:02.437
Well, that's a little extreme.

36:02.461 --> 36:05.310
Not really. I was probably
gonna do it eventually anyhow.

36:05.334 --> 36:07.347
Obviously we're gonna
have to get a divorce

36:07.371 --> 36:09.344
before I can actually marry her.

36:09.368 --> 36:11.468
But, uh... what?

36:13.472 --> 36:16.281
Nothing. I just...

36:16.305 --> 36:19.153
I didn't know that
you loved her like that.

36:19.177 --> 36:21.747
She's a great kid.
Total package.

36:22.881 --> 36:25.890
What's the matter, susie q?
Jealous?

36:25.914 --> 36:28.324
No, of course not.

36:29.918 --> 36:33.198
Well, okay,
this is good because...

36:33.222 --> 36:38.172
You know, if this experience
helped you to realize

36:38.196 --> 36:40.545
your true feelings, then, uh...

36:40.569 --> 36:42.807
Then we did something good here.

36:42.831 --> 36:46.251
Yeah. I think we have.

36:46.275 --> 36:48.283
Come here.

36:48.307 --> 36:51.286
I can't believe
you thought I was jealous.

36:51.310 --> 36:54.359
It's not like I still have
feelings for you anymore.

36:54.383 --> 36:58.223
You're right.
I-I was just fooling around.

37:01.350 --> 37:03.798
So? How did it go?

37:03.822 --> 37:07.302
Fine. I just dropped off
the luggage and left.

37:07.326 --> 37:08.456
Oh.

37:14.663 --> 37:16.273
Mmm.

37:18.367 --> 37:20.415
What was that for?

37:20.439 --> 37:23.388
No reason.

37:23.412 --> 37:25.390
Hey, I was thinking...

37:25.414 --> 37:28.253
Weshould look into adoption.

37:28.277 --> 37:31.296
Seriously? Mm-hmm.

37:31.320 --> 37:34.329
But I thought you wanted
a kid with your own d.N.A.?

37:34.353 --> 37:36.863
Blood isn't everything.

37:42.361 --> 37:44.361
Mmm.

37:57.376 --> 37:58.446
Hey!

37:59.978 --> 38:02.256
I heard ya lost
your kids yesterday.

38:02.280 --> 38:03.558
Yeah.

38:03.582 --> 38:06.566
It was cleared up.
It was just a little confusion.

38:06.590 --> 38:08.733
Uh, help me out here
with something.

38:08.757 --> 38:11.536
What exactly is it
you look for in a baby-sitter?

38:11.560 --> 38:12.697
Excuse me?

38:12.721 --> 38:15.440
Well, I may be ancient,
like you say,

38:15.464 --> 38:18.443
but I've never gotten drunk
and lost track of three kids.

38:18.467 --> 38:19.404
What?

38:19.428 --> 38:21.406
I smelled wine
on Bree Van De Kamp

38:21.430 --> 38:23.578
when she was looking
for your boys.

38:23.602 --> 38:25.780
That's ridiculous. Is it?

38:25.804 --> 38:28.418
Yesterday I found her passed out
on her front lawn,

38:28.442 --> 38:31.416
drunk as a skunk. I've known
Bree for years and years.

38:31.440 --> 38:33.918
There's no way she was drinking
while baby-sitting my kids.

38:33.942 --> 38:36.996
So... just go spread your poison
somewhere else. Okay?

38:37.020 --> 38:39.594
I just thought I'd do you
a favor and let you know,

38:39.618 --> 38:40.595
that's all.

38:40.619 --> 38:42.389
Okay, well, thanks.

38:47.826 --> 38:50.304
Hi.

38:50.328 --> 38:54.809
You, um, you recovered from
all of yesterday's excitement?

38:54.833 --> 38:57.850
Oh, truthfully, I haven't been
able to get my mind off it.

38:57.874 --> 38:59.344
What a scare, huh?

38:59.368 --> 39:02.847
Yeah, although
I-I still can't figure out

39:02.871 --> 39:05.641
how my boys
managed to sneak past you.

39:07.516 --> 39:09.394
Well, you know
how boys are at the age.

39:09.418 --> 39:10.895
They're escape artists.

39:10.919 --> 39:13.498
They're like lightning.

39:13.522 --> 39:14.859
It's just, penny...

39:14.883 --> 39:16.601
Penny?

39:16.625 --> 39:18.733
Well, I mean,
I just don't understand

39:18.757 --> 39:22.106
how Porter and Preston managed
to wrangle her into the stroller

39:22.130 --> 39:24.369
and then make it out
your front door

39:24.393 --> 39:26.441
without you even noticing.

39:33.972 --> 39:36.621
I guess
if you'd fallen asleep...

39:36.645 --> 39:38.523
It could've happened
like that, I-I guess.

39:38.547 --> 39:40.024
You know, I think, um,

39:40.048 --> 39:42.126
I must have been cleaning
the kitchen,

39:42.150 --> 39:44.389
and I-I just didn't hear them

39:44.413 --> 39:47.100
because of the noise
from the dishwasher.

39:47.124 --> 39:51.466
Look, I apologize in advance
for how this is going to sound,

39:51.490 --> 39:54.138
but I have to ask. It's just
gonna eat away at me.

39:54.162 --> 39:56.879
Were you drinking
while baby-sitting my kids?

39:56.903 --> 39:58.165
No!

40:02.531 --> 40:04.479
Oh...

40:04.503 --> 40:06.481
You know, I may have had

40:06.505 --> 40:09.984
just the tiniest little bit
of chardonnay.

40:10.008 --> 40:14.789
Oh, gosh, you got drunk,
and you passed out.

40:14.813 --> 40:17.396
Lynette, if I close my eyes
even for a moment,

40:17.420 --> 40:19.894
it's because of these
antihistamines I've been taking.

40:19.918 --> 40:21.065
Really?

40:21.089 --> 40:23.668
Is that why you passed out
on your front lawn

40:23.692 --> 40:25.470
yesterday morning?

40:25.494 --> 40:28.478
Now that you're speaking to me
in a fairly accusatory tone,

40:28.502 --> 40:30.975
may I remind you that
I was doing you a favor?

40:30.999 --> 40:33.478
You put my kids in danger,
and then you lied about it.

40:33.502 --> 40:35.480
Do you not get how big that is?

40:35.504 --> 40:37.487
Do you have some
kind of problem with alcohol?

40:37.511 --> 40:39.814
No! The only problem I have
is with your children.

40:39.838 --> 40:42.517
They're incorrigible
because you let them run amok.

40:42.541 --> 40:43.818
And if I hadn't drifted off,

40:43.842 --> 40:45.990
they would have waited
until I was in the bathroom

40:46.014 --> 40:48.531
or stuck on the phone
or upstairs doing laundry.

40:48.555 --> 40:50.024
On any given day,

40:50.048 --> 40:53.148
how many glasses of wine
do you put away?

40:56.454 --> 40:58.671
I will not be spoken to
like that.

40:58.695 --> 41:00.557
I just won't.

41:19.948 --> 41:22.848
Now and then,
we allneed a little help...

41:25.554 --> 41:28.863
So we ask for small favors.

41:28.887 --> 41:31.596
Thanks. I owe you one.

41:31.620 --> 41:33.097
But it's always best

41:33.121 --> 41:36.641
to be wary of those eager
to come to our rescue.

41:36.665 --> 41:38.765
Well, go on. Kiss the bride.

41:45.534 --> 41:47.761
Because even the smallest
of favors...

41:47.785 --> 41:51.756
Sure thing, Tom. I'd be happy
to baby-sit for you.

41:51.780 --> 41:55.059
My, have you noticed
how clogged my rain gutters are?

41:55.083 --> 41:57.822
Carries a price tag.

41:57.846 --> 42:00.595
Yes, everyone has an agenda.

42:00.619 --> 42:02.597
I heard about your operation,
aunt Inez,

42:02.621 --> 42:04.599
and I'm jumping
on a plane right now

42:04.623 --> 42:06.601
to come and help you out.

42:06.625 --> 42:08.603
No matter what they may tell us.

42:08.627 --> 42:10.805
No, I'm happy to,

42:10.829 --> 42:15.740
and I'm prepared to stay
as long as it takes.

42:15.764 --> 42:17.982
And in those rare instances

42:18.006 --> 42:21.245
where thereis
no ulterior motive,

42:21.269 --> 42:22.917
we're so taken aback

42:22.941 --> 42:25.671
that we may fail
to recognize the truth...

42:38.887 --> 42:41.887
That a loving friend has just
done us an enormous favor.
