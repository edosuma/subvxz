31:44.500 --> 31:47.617
and those of the fine officers
of the NSW Police Force.

31:53.860 --> 31:56.260
I heard they're going to
call every cop in this city.

31:56.260 --> 31:58.660
Royal commission.
Waste of fucking time and money.

31:58.660 --> 32:01.860
Fucking Debbie Webb, hey? I mean,
who would have thought? Of all people.

32:01.860 --> 32:03.140
Fat mouthy moll.

32:03.140 --> 32:06.100
Look, they can't prove anything
if we all just keep shtum.

32:06.100 --> 32:07.580
It's a royal commission, Trev.

32:07.580 --> 32:11.980
They charge you with contempt,
lock you up if you refuse to speak. Jim?

32:11.980 --> 32:14.260
They wouldn't lock up
cops, would they?

32:14.260 --> 32:16.940
Justice Wood? He's got a nasty look
in his eye, mate. He'll go.

32:16.940 --> 32:18.340
Whoo!

32:18.340 --> 32:21.460
Hey, hey. Stop pissing your pants,
ya bunch of girls.

32:21.460 --> 32:23.900
The pollies are banging
the law and order drum

32:23.900 --> 32:25.740
because there's
an election coming up.

32:25.740 --> 32:28.820
Exactly, I mean, it's going to take
any investigators weeks

32:28.820 --> 32:30.700
just to choose the colour
of the wallpaper.

32:30.700 --> 32:33.100
We'll all have plenty of time
to get our stories straight

32:33.100 --> 32:35.489
and then all we gotta do
is stick to it.

32:36.620 --> 32:37.620
Beer.

32:37.620 --> 32:38.620
Beer?

32:38.620 --> 32:39.620
Beer.

32:39.620 --> 32:41.850
Trev?
No.

32:43.140 --> 32:47.020
NARRATOR: Two days after John
Hatton's historic parliamentary victory,

32:47.020 --> 32:50.180
the letters patent were issued
to Justice James Wood,

32:50.180 --> 32:52.580
who was commissioned
to head the inquiry.

32:52.580 --> 32:57.180
The Wood Royal Commission
was to change the face and nature

32:57.180 --> 33:01.700
of policing in NSW for years to come.

33:01.700 --> 33:04.780
GERRY: We have listening devices,
we have telephone intercepts.

33:04.780 --> 33:07.380
We have state-of-the-art
tracking devices.

33:07.380 --> 33:10.620
We are part of the best-equipped
investigation team

33:10.620 --> 33:13.420
ever established in this country.

33:13.420 --> 33:15.092
MAN: Hear, hear.

33:17.220 --> 33:20.500
But none of these shiny toys is
going to get us past square one

33:20.500 --> 33:22.340
unless we know where to put them.

33:22.340 --> 33:27.180
There are 14,000 serving officers
in the NSW force.

33:27.180 --> 33:28.740
Not all of them are corrupt.

33:28.740 --> 33:31.540
But there are plenty
of shitheads who are.

33:31.540 --> 33:34.420
And they're clever,
sneaky shitheads

33:34.420 --> 33:37.180
who will close ranks
at the first whiff of a leak

33:37.180 --> 33:40.140
and will never cheerfully come to us
just to fess up.

33:40.140 --> 33:42.780
The only way to do our job...
expose corruption...

33:42.780 --> 33:45.500
is get someone on the inside.

33:45.500 --> 33:48.940
Sniff around, find people...
cop or crim...

33:48.940 --> 33:51.580
that we can put between
a rock and a hard place

33:51.580 --> 33:55.340
and get them to point our bells
and whistles at the corrupt officers.

33:55.340 --> 33:57.820
Mr Agius?

33:57.820 --> 34:00.060
Uh, might I add... do it legally.

34:00.060 --> 34:02.100
Spoken like a true lawyer.
(LAUGHTER)

34:02.100 --> 34:04.136
Alright, let's get stuck into it.

34:25.820 --> 34:27.420
Birth classes!

34:27.420 --> 34:32.699
"Breathe out, visualise your cervix
opening like a flower.

34:32.699 --> 34:34.980
"Visualise, visualise..."
You're not visualising.

34:34.980 --> 34:37.699
I am visualising. Trouble is
I'm visualising a bottle of gin.

34:38.820 --> 34:40.620
Ah!

34:40.620 --> 34:42.940
Even the local rag's onto me.

34:42.940 --> 34:45.699
Apparently Hatton's a zealot

34:45.699 --> 34:47.219
and I'm a troublemaker.

34:47.219 --> 34:50.340
You know, he reckons I could be
in the witness box for days.

34:50.340 --> 34:51.853
Looking forward to that.

34:53.179 --> 34:54.659
What?

34:54.659 --> 34:57.891
That van's been in the street on
and off for the last couple of days.

35:00.500 --> 35:01.979
Greg.

35:06.060 --> 35:07.937
Can I help you with something, mate?

35:13.180 --> 35:15.300
We don't know for sure
it was there for us.

35:15.300 --> 35:17.291
GREG: No.

35:21.700 --> 35:23.940
How long are we going to
have to live like this?

35:23.940 --> 35:25.498
Cops have got long memories.

35:29.020 --> 35:33.380
We could leave.
Pack it in, go to Queensland.

35:33.380 --> 35:36.500
Senior Constables Locke and Locke
of Balmain

35:36.500 --> 35:38.536
become Mr and Mrs Smith
of Maroochydore?

35:39.820 --> 35:41.580
I just want you to be safe.

35:41.580 --> 35:44.620
We become anonymous,
we're easy targets.

35:44.620 --> 35:46.700
We're safer here
with you in the force

35:46.700 --> 35:49.060
and me in the paper
every second fucking day.

35:49.060 --> 35:50.539
We weren't that safe tonight.

35:51.940 --> 35:53.420
No.

35:53.420 --> 35:56.140
When I was a woodchuck,
Joe Dooley used to tell me

35:56.140 --> 35:58.580
to pick my moment to pull my head
out of the sand.

35:58.580 --> 36:00.696
Time it wrongly, you get
your head blown off.

36:02.380 --> 36:04.060
I got the worst fucking timing.

36:04.060 --> 36:06.016
And a bloody big head.

36:24.980 --> 36:26.698
You're not really giving up?

36:27.780 --> 36:30.420
I'm sick of being treated
like I don't matter.

36:30.420 --> 36:33.300
Sick of being three holes on legs.

36:33.300 --> 36:35.530
Well, what will you do for money?

36:38.980 --> 36:40.500
Dunno.

36:40.500 --> 36:42.100
If I don't use
my head for something,

36:42.100 --> 36:43.613
I'm going to go bloody mental.

36:45.260 --> 36:47.296
So you just give up on everything?

36:49.100 --> 36:50.249
On me.

36:52.500 --> 36:57.060
You can give up hooking too, Gale.
Do something else with your life.

36:57.060 --> 37:01.690
I don't want to stop.
I don't want this to end.

37:06.380 --> 37:10.976
Kimmy, we had fun, you know?
It was fun.

37:14.060 --> 37:16.096
Once upon a time, we did.

37:17.180 --> 37:19.940
But I'm not having fun anymore.

37:19.940 --> 37:23.410
(SOBS) Oh. Oh, babe. I'm sorry.

37:24.740 --> 37:26.780
Sorry.

37:26.780 --> 37:29.453
I'm so sorry.

37:42.340 --> 37:44.500
So, you've given hooking the flick.

37:44.500 --> 37:46.100
You blitzed your HSC.

37:46.100 --> 37:48.773
What are you going to do
now, you egghead?

37:49.980 --> 37:51.857
Guess.

37:53.700 --> 37:55.340
No way.

37:55.340 --> 37:56.340
Mm-hm.

37:56.340 --> 37:58.979
You are seriously not going to
join the police force?!

38:00.380 --> 38:03.260
(SCOFFS) Fuck! Kim.

38:03.260 --> 38:05.500
They treat you like shit.

38:05.500 --> 38:07.060
They stick a gun in your fanny.

38:07.060 --> 38:08.540
They turn their backs on you.

38:08.540 --> 38:12.055
Vanessa's got more sense than you
and she's bloody six weeks old.

38:13.100 --> 38:15.380
KIM: Yeah, well, she's a genius

38:15.380 --> 38:18.020
and I'm just a country girl
who always wanted to be a cop.

38:18.020 --> 38:20.853
Bad time to be a cop in NSW.

38:23.260 --> 38:27.100
So, um, can I put you down

38:27.100 --> 38:29.740
as a referee on my application form?

38:29.740 --> 38:30.740
(LAUGHS) Oh!

38:30.740 --> 38:32.890
If you want to be burnt at the stake.

38:36.340 --> 38:42.256
I've, um... applied for
a medical discharge.

38:43.780 --> 38:45.498
Wow.

38:47.340 --> 38:49.979
Leaving the police force.
How does that feel?

38:51.380 --> 38:53.496
You should know.

38:55.380 --> 38:57.416
Cop's all I've ever wanted to be too.

39:03.620 --> 39:07.180
NARRATOR: John Ibrahim had spent
barely three weeks behind bars

39:07.180 --> 39:10.380
on remand for accessory to the murder
of drug dealer Talal Assaad

39:10.380 --> 39:13.660
when royal commissioner James Wood
ordered his release.

39:13.660 --> 39:15.140
His case, among others,

39:15.140 --> 39:19.180
was put on hold until Justice Wood
had completed his inquiry.

39:19.180 --> 39:21.620
MAN: Under the terms of your bail,
you need to report...

39:21.620 --> 39:24.460
Twice a week.
I'm a law-abiding citizen.

39:24.460 --> 39:26.100
Don't worry, mate.

39:26.100 --> 39:27.658
There you go.

39:28.860 --> 39:30.380
(LAUGHS)

39:30.380 --> 39:31.860
Hey, you heard
that old Chinese curse?

39:31.860 --> 39:33.380
What curse would that be?

39:33.380 --> 39:36.531
"May you live in interesting times."

39:38.820 --> 39:41.539
Time's going to get pretty
interesting around here soon.

39:53.020 --> 39:54.540
Joe Dooley's gone.

39:54.540 --> 39:56.260
TREVOR: Where? Up his own arse?

39:56.260 --> 39:57.820
No, the academy.

39:57.820 --> 39:59.340
He's got delusions of grandeur.

39:59.340 --> 40:00.940
He's doing the D's course.

40:00.940 --> 40:03.220
What? Detective Joe Dickhead?

40:03.220 --> 40:06.620
Don't worry, mate. He's going to bring
the crime rate down in no time flat.

40:06.620 --> 40:08.340
Single-handedly.

40:08.340 --> 40:09.380
(ALL LAUGH)

40:09.380 --> 40:12.020
Have you blokes heard about
the royal commission investigators?

40:12.020 --> 40:13.060
Nup.

40:13.060 --> 40:17.380
Word is they're all feds, Poms
or South Australians.

40:17.380 --> 40:19.220
Ooh, the A-team, hey?

40:19.220 --> 40:21.260
Wouldn't know one side
of the State from the other.

40:21.260 --> 40:24.220
FOWLER: What the fucking fuck?!

40:24.220 --> 40:25.620
What?

40:25.620 --> 40:30.260
We're being transferred to Central.
You and me. Effective immediately.

40:30.260 --> 40:33.940
Some bullshit
about internal renewal.

40:33.940 --> 40:35.339
SCULLY: Shit.

40:36.780 --> 40:38.420
Bloody hell, mate. Shit.

40:38.420 --> 40:41.730
Stop panicking, Scully.
It's not raining fucking frogs.

40:49.020 --> 40:52.380
NARRATOR: But one way or another,
the Wood Royal Commission

40:52.380 --> 40:55.820
would touch almost all of
the denizens of the Golden Mile.

40:55.820 --> 40:57.460
Some chose to be involved.

40:57.460 --> 40:59.974
Others had no choice.

41:03.980 --> 41:07.609
For better or for worse,
change was coming.
