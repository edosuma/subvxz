A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

01:36.840 --> 01:38.120
God dammit, what is that?

01:42.120 --> 01:43.560
Get up, Mr. Pellegrini.

01:43.640 --> 01:46.000
-What?
-The perimeter is compromised.

01:46.080 --> 01:48.360
-What?
-Follow us into the panic room, please.

01:51.080 --> 01:52.240
Yes.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.160
Come on, catch it!

01:59.560 --> 02:00.600
What's that?

02:09.760 --> 02:10.960
Careful!

02:15.040 --> 02:16.000
I got it!

02:21.240 --> 02:23.520
Watch out! To your left! Quick, the door!

02:30.520 --> 02:33.080
-We have neutralized the intruder.
-Who?

02:33.760 --> 02:34.640
What's this?

02:35.200 --> 02:37.680
The device is destroyed.
It's under control.

02:37.760 --> 02:38.600
Yeah, good.

02:54.160 --> 02:57.240
I'LL GET YOU

02:57.320 --> 03:00.240
It's fine. The perimeter is clear.
I have checked.

03:49.760 --> 03:50.720
How's it going?

03:54.960 --> 03:57.080
Don't recognize me without my glasses?

04:03.040 --> 04:03.920
Assane?

04:05.200 --> 04:06.040
That's right.

04:12.400 --> 04:13.360
Smile, Dumont.

04:15.640 --> 04:18.160
I brought you a present. Your Circé.

04:20.560 --> 04:21.560
You did break it?

04:24.680 --> 04:27.440
-What now?
-I want to know about your friend.

04:28.240 --> 04:29.600
-My friend?
-Pellegrini.

04:33.280 --> 04:34.840
What did you want to tell him?

05:00.080 --> 05:01.200
Where is your wife?

05:03.240 --> 05:04.320
-At work.
-No.

05:05.680 --> 05:06.640
She's not there.

05:09.280 --> 05:11.080
You leave my wife out of this!

05:11.160 --> 05:13.920
-She should be there.
-It's nothing to do with her!

05:14.000 --> 05:15.120
So spill the beans.

05:24.720 --> 05:25.960
If I give you a name…

05:27.680 --> 05:29.000
you swear you'll stop?

05:29.080 --> 05:29.920
I swear.

05:30.440 --> 05:32.680
-You give me your word?
-You have it.

05:32.760 --> 05:34.400
-Are you a man of your word?
-No.

05:37.440 --> 05:38.280
Got a choice?

05:42.760 --> 05:44.320
You want to bring down Pellegrini?

05:46.320 --> 05:49.280
There's a woman, Fabienne Bériot,
who can help you.

05:50.400 --> 05:53.720
She's a journalist.
A few years ago, she almost got him.

05:55.760 --> 05:57.000
You didn't hear it from me.

06:10.800 --> 06:11.640
See you soon.

06:23.160 --> 06:24.480
-Hello?
-Where are you?

06:25.160 --> 06:28.080
-At the office, why? Is there a problem?
-No.

06:28.160 --> 06:29.640
-Are you OK?
-Yes.

06:29.720 --> 06:31.880
-You sound off.
-I wanted to say I love you.

06:31.960 --> 06:33.840
OK, darling. I love you too.

06:33.920 --> 06:35.920
-Have a good day.
-Have a good day.

06:45.800 --> 06:49.000
FABIENNE BÉRIOT TO PAY
RECORD FINE TO HUBERT PELLEGRINI

07:11.520 --> 07:12.360
J'accuse?

07:16.160 --> 07:17.200
J'accuse!

07:22.880 --> 07:27.280
FABIENNE BÉRIOT
DIRTY MONEY - THE PELLEGRINI SYSTEM

07:27.360 --> 07:29.040
ITEM ADDED TO YOUR CART

07:30.200 --> 07:31.040
Come.

07:34.960 --> 07:37.520
Next time,
you carry the groceries upstairs.

08:03.200 --> 08:04.080
So,

08:05.280 --> 08:07.360
what's your story, Fabienne Bériot?

08:11.400 --> 08:12.240
Come on.

08:43.400 --> 08:44.240
Don't be scared.

08:44.720 --> 08:45.640
Of what?

08:47.480 --> 08:48.480
I'm not scared.

08:49.760 --> 08:51.000
I'm too old and weak.

08:53.720 --> 08:55.960
Here to steal? You'll be disappointed.

08:56.520 --> 08:59.400
The most expensive thing here
is a bad Merlot.

08:59.480 --> 09:02.680
-Do I look like a thug?
-You look like a trespasser.

09:03.160 --> 09:05.280
I'm not a thief. I'm a fan.

09:09.360 --> 09:10.280
Sign it for me?

09:11.520 --> 09:13.240
-What's this?
-It's your book.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.160
-No, I don't think so.
-Stop it.

09:15.680 --> 09:19.000
-I know you're Fabienne Bériot.
-She doesn't live here anymore.

09:27.080 --> 09:29.320
Fabienne. I need you.

09:29.400 --> 09:32.200
Fabienne doesn't exist anymore.

09:32.280 --> 09:35.120
She was silenced by big money!
Right, J'accuse?

09:36.240 --> 09:37.920
What you wrote here is the truth.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.560
It was the truth,

09:39.640 --> 09:41.720
but I faced an army of lawyers.

09:41.800 --> 09:44.400
I didn't have the means to defend myself
and was destroyed.

09:44.480 --> 09:46.200
Then we have a common enemy.

09:47.440 --> 09:48.560
It's Pellegrini.

09:49.120 --> 09:51.160
I'm busy. Don't let me keep you.

09:51.920 --> 09:54.560
You're like me.
You want revenge on Pellegrini.

09:56.840 --> 09:58.080
Pellegrini.

09:59.360 --> 10:02.760
I did teach him to bark
when hearing that name,

10:02.840 --> 10:04.200
but that's old.

10:04.280 --> 10:06.360
-Not into that anymore.
-Impossible.

10:07.560 --> 10:09.160
You were a real sniper.

10:09.240 --> 10:11.800
Pharmaceutical labs, Françafrique.

10:12.680 --> 10:15.000
You took them all down. What about him?

10:15.640 --> 10:18.080
The fight is over? You stopped believing?

10:19.640 --> 10:22.440
How do I know
you're not working for Pellegrini?

10:23.200 --> 10:26.640
That you're not here
to make sure I'm still at rock bottom?

10:27.160 --> 10:28.640
Well, you see. I'm there.

10:29.560 --> 10:30.800
All right. Good day!

10:33.600 --> 10:35.280
He framed my dad 25 years ago.

10:37.680 --> 10:40.000
He threw him into a cell as a thief.

10:44.480 --> 10:46.200
He hanged himself out of shame.

10:48.600 --> 10:49.600
I was 14.

10:52.200 --> 10:53.800
He fucked my life up too.

10:59.600 --> 11:01.720
You're the only one who fought back.

11:03.160 --> 11:04.160
I need you.

11:06.520 --> 11:08.720
This book is tough. Courageous.

11:09.360 --> 11:10.560
Where is its writer?

11:14.520 --> 11:16.320
I want to help her finish the job.

11:21.520 --> 11:22.600
No, I'm sorry.

11:25.160 --> 11:27.840
He's got spies everywhere.
He's untouchable.

11:30.160 --> 11:31.560
Just beat it. Go away.

11:34.120 --> 11:34.960
Go home.

11:52.640 --> 11:54.720
I want to make sure I understand.

11:54.800 --> 11:57.880
You think the guy who kidnapped me
also stole the necklace?

11:58.640 --> 11:59.480
Because?

11:59.960 --> 12:03.000
You investigated the theft 25 years ago.

12:03.080 --> 12:05.360
-Is that all?
-No. There's also the MO.

12:05.440 --> 12:08.160
Whether it's the theft or your abduction,

12:08.720 --> 12:10.120
there's kind of a…

12:10.200 --> 12:11.160
Showmanship.

12:11.240 --> 12:13.960
Exactly. Showmanship.
That connects both cases.

12:14.760 --> 12:16.480
And if I may,

12:16.560 --> 12:19.480
I want to add something.
I know I'm the only one who thinks this.

12:20.080 --> 12:23.360
I really think
there's a shared source of inspiration.

12:23.440 --> 12:25.120
-Not this again.
-Yes.

12:25.200 --> 12:26.400
Shared inspiration?

12:27.320 --> 12:29.440
And who would this inspiration be?

12:31.800 --> 12:33.400
Arsène Lupin, Commissioner.

12:34.320 --> 12:36.560
Gentleman Burglar by Maurice Leblanc.

12:37.600 --> 12:40.640
The Queen's Necklace
was published in 1923 in Le Journal.

12:40.720 --> 12:42.160
A great classic.

12:42.240 --> 12:45.040
The pseudonyms used,
Paul Sernine, Luis Perenna.

12:45.120 --> 12:46.680
Anagrams of Arsène Lupin.

12:47.160 --> 12:49.520
And the method, panache, style, talent.

12:50.400 --> 12:53.160
Our suspect is playing at
being Arsène Lupin.

12:54.200 --> 12:57.440
I made a list of the similarities.
I can send it to you.

12:57.960 --> 13:00.440
-Yes. I want that list at once.
-There.

13:01.520 --> 13:03.120
Now that you mention it,

13:03.960 --> 13:04.800
I remember.

13:05.600 --> 13:08.560
The guy who kidnapped me
had a top hat and monocle.

13:11.600 --> 13:13.600
We've got footage
from surveillance cameras.

13:13.680 --> 13:15.400
We'll do a composite sketch.

13:15.480 --> 13:18.000
We'll soon know the face
of the one who targeted you.

13:18.080 --> 13:20.560
Excellent. Go ahead.
Don't let me keep you.

13:34.600 --> 13:37.440
YOU WANTED TO TALK ABOUT BABAKAR DIOP.
WHEN?

13:42.280 --> 13:44.960
I NEED MORE INFORMATION.
I'LL KEEP YOU POSTED.

14:10.400 --> 14:11.320
How'd you find me?

14:11.400 --> 14:14.000
A good journalist never reveals
her sources.

14:19.080 --> 14:22.040
-Did you change your mind?
-He took my most valued thing.

14:22.120 --> 14:23.160
My career.

14:24.920 --> 14:27.880
He made sure
all of Paris knew not to hire me.

14:27.960 --> 14:30.640
Blackballed.
That I was a crazy old cat lady.

14:31.600 --> 14:33.720
-That's not the truth.
-Well, no.

14:34.280 --> 14:35.840
More of a dog person.

14:37.200 --> 14:39.680
When you're a woman of my age,

14:39.760 --> 14:42.840
looking like me,
the decision is easily made. Trash.

14:44.920 --> 14:47.080
But he went a little too far.

14:48.320 --> 14:49.680
I've got nothing left.

14:50.440 --> 14:51.920
And nothing left to lose.

14:53.160 --> 14:55.040
When you came to my place,

14:55.120 --> 14:57.760
when you showed me my book,
believe it or not…

14:59.160 --> 15:01.760
no one had spoken to me in days.

15:01.840 --> 15:03.960
And saying nice things to boot.

15:04.560 --> 15:06.960
So, I thought about it…

15:10.760 --> 15:13.040
-I'm going to help you.
-Are you sure?

15:13.120 --> 15:15.640
A little adrenaline couldn't hurt.

15:17.360 --> 15:19.040
I don't want to let him win.

15:20.440 --> 15:23.360
-I need to be able to trust you.
-You came to me!

15:25.040 --> 15:27.760
I also need to be able to trust you.
Your name?

15:28.520 --> 15:29.560
Guillaume Berlat.

15:30.920 --> 15:31.960
Yeah, right.

15:32.520 --> 15:34.400
-Nice try.
-OK.

15:35.040 --> 15:36.680
My name is Jean Daspry.

15:39.360 --> 15:42.640
Last try. Otherwise,
you'll have to get on without me.

15:47.120 --> 15:47.960
Diop.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.480
My name is Assane Diop.

15:51.760 --> 15:52.760
Nice to meet you.

15:54.280 --> 15:56.720
-Fabienne Bériot.
-Nice to meet you.

16:00.880 --> 16:02.960
This is even messier than my place.

16:04.200 --> 16:07.000
I broke into his house to look for papers.

16:07.080 --> 16:09.920
-Looking for information, but…
-What do you want?

16:11.960 --> 16:13.200
To bring him down.

16:13.760 --> 16:15.440
Find something compromising.

16:16.120 --> 16:19.280
I know he framed my father
to get the insurance money.

16:19.400 --> 16:20.960
-What year?
-1995.

16:23.200 --> 16:24.160
Yeah, that fits.

16:26.080 --> 16:29.440
That's the year
when his company almost collapsed.

16:29.520 --> 16:30.840
He frames your father,

16:31.360 --> 16:34.480
he gets the insurance money,
and he saves his empire.

16:35.040 --> 16:37.800
That's it. He swindled everybody.

16:37.880 --> 16:39.560
Except I can't prove it yet.

16:40.280 --> 16:43.520
-Everyone must know this guy's a crook.
-I tried it before you.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.400
It didn't work out for me.

16:45.480 --> 16:47.880
He could kill the story then, but now?

16:48.400 --> 16:51.400
-What do you mean?
-We need something big, Fabienne.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.600
Something to drag him down.

16:54.600 --> 16:56.280
Something he can't cover up.

16:56.880 --> 16:59.000
We need some noise. Then he's dead.

17:02.920 --> 17:04.400
I may have something.

17:06.480 --> 17:07.480
A little closer.

17:08.880 --> 17:09.760
Not the eyes.

17:11.440 --> 17:12.280
These eyes?

17:13.520 --> 17:16.440
That's not bad. Show me the next one.

17:16.520 --> 17:19.200
-I also have this.
-That's looking good.

17:19.280 --> 17:21.240
-It's closer.
-That one isn't bad.

17:22.400 --> 17:24.000
This one will give you…

17:24.720 --> 17:25.800
Yeah.

17:25.880 --> 17:27.360
Is this your only option?

17:32.840 --> 17:34.560
It can't be that complicated.

17:41.680 --> 17:42.840
The Objector.

17:43.600 --> 17:45.760
The paper where I worked my whole life.

17:45.840 --> 17:49.400
From my internship
to the day Pellegrini got me fired.

17:50.200 --> 17:52.760
The archives are on the third floor.

17:53.840 --> 17:57.280
There's a box inside.
It's labeled "'80s Sports."

17:58.000 --> 18:00.920
And in there, there's a green VHS tape.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.680
That's what you need to get.

18:03.160 --> 18:04.800
-What's on it?
-Don't worry.

18:05.320 --> 18:06.160
Well, no.

18:06.880 --> 18:09.440
I'm taking all the risks. Is it worth it?

18:09.520 --> 18:12.360
It's worth it because I say so!
And you trust me!

18:20.880 --> 18:21.960
It's a meeting

18:23.160 --> 18:26.080
that Pellegrini attended in 1996.

18:26.160 --> 18:27.960
Believe me, it could hurt him.

18:29.680 --> 18:32.280
You only decided
to get this tape back now?

18:32.360 --> 18:35.360
I tried a hundred times,
but they know my face.

18:35.440 --> 18:37.160
I can't get through the door.

18:37.240 --> 18:40.720
But I just met a guy
who loves to break into places.

18:46.640 --> 18:49.120
-Are you using these files?
-No, take them.

18:53.240 --> 18:54.080
OK.

19:00.280 --> 19:02.600
-You know the coward trick?
-No.

19:22.840 --> 19:24.080
Front desk.

19:24.160 --> 19:27.520
This is Nathalie Lacombe.
I'm an investigative journalist.

19:28.040 --> 19:30.760
-OK.
-An informant is to drop off a file.

19:30.840 --> 19:34.080
An odd duck, but he's a solid source.
His intel is gold.

19:34.760 --> 19:37.120
The issue is that he's a little scared.

19:37.200 --> 19:40.480
So if he shows up, don't let him leave.

19:40.560 --> 19:42.600
Send him straight to my office.

19:42.680 --> 19:44.120
What does he look like?

19:44.760 --> 19:47.360
A tall Black guy. Looks like a nerd.

19:47.440 --> 19:49.560
I see him. He's in front of me.

19:50.120 --> 19:52.520
-Is he holding some files?
-Yes.

19:52.600 --> 19:55.480
Don't let him leave.
Send him to me straight away. Third floor.

19:55.560 --> 19:58.080
Third floor. OK, Mrs. Lacombe.

19:58.160 --> 20:01.560
-He's running away!
- Go catch him, you moron!

20:01.640 --> 20:03.360
Yes! Sir?

20:04.680 --> 20:06.800
-Sir, please.
-Me?

20:06.880 --> 20:08.640
Yes, follow me. Come.

20:08.720 --> 20:10.360
I talked to the journalist.

20:14.560 --> 20:17.920
There. Take the first left,
and then to your right.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.360
-Thank you, sir.
-OK? You're welcome.

20:28.680 --> 20:29.800
More like that one.

20:44.400 --> 20:45.640
Yeah, the fourth one.

20:46.200 --> 20:47.920
-You see that guy?
-Yeah.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.560
He's a top-level informant.
I sent him to Mrs. Lacombe.

20:52.840 --> 20:53.920
There you go.

20:55.520 --> 20:56.640
Who did you say?

20:57.360 --> 21:00.280
Mrs. Lacombe,
Investigation Services. Third floor.

21:00.360 --> 21:01.560
She's on sick leave.

21:01.640 --> 21:02.680
-You sure?
-Yes.

21:03.200 --> 21:04.040
Sir!

21:05.000 --> 21:06.760
Sir!

21:06.840 --> 21:08.440
Go on, go the other way!

21:10.680 --> 21:11.880
Shit.

21:14.280 --> 21:15.280
Start the car.

21:18.240 --> 21:19.360
Are you kidding me?

21:20.040 --> 21:22.840
-Your software is crap.
-It's not his fault.

21:22.920 --> 21:24.400
Four different people.

21:24.480 --> 21:28.000
That's true.
As though he could alter his appearance.

21:30.160 --> 21:34.560
What? It's true! I mean…
I'll keep it at that, because clearly…

21:38.000 --> 21:39.960
"French Chess Championship 1983."

21:40.800 --> 21:43.000
Don't tell me
I almost got caught for that?

21:43.080 --> 21:45.920
I had to make sure
no one would watch it.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.640
Kuala Lumpur attack in 1996.

21:48.720 --> 21:49.840
Does it ring a bell?

21:50.360 --> 21:53.280
-A terrorist attack?
-Eleven dead. Eight French citizens.

21:53.760 --> 21:55.960
The truth? It was revenge.

21:56.560 --> 22:00.480
A go-between swindled
the Malaysian arm traffickers.

22:00.560 --> 22:03.320
So they blew up the French embassy.

22:04.320 --> 22:06.400
And the crooked go-between was…

22:07.280 --> 22:08.400
Pellegrini.

22:09.080 --> 22:09.960
Play it.

22:14.440 --> 22:16.000
My situation has evolved.

22:16.840 --> 22:19.040
I don't like it either,
but that's the way it is.

22:20.400 --> 22:22.400
You'll have to pay double for the weapons.

22:23.720 --> 22:24.720
Double?

22:26.360 --> 22:27.720
What is this blackmail?

22:28.960 --> 22:31.000
My client won't be pleased.

22:31.480 --> 22:33.720
I have lots of other potential buyers.

22:34.440 --> 22:35.920
You made a deal with him.

22:36.760 --> 22:39.960
I don't care who buys the weapons
or where they end up.

22:41.560 --> 22:45.120
If you refuse to pay,
I'm warning you, this is over.

22:46.280 --> 22:47.880
Forget about this deal.

22:49.240 --> 22:50.600
You don't give us a choice.

22:55.360 --> 22:58.320
These weapons were used
to attack the embassy.

22:58.400 --> 23:02.120
Maybe he bought them with
the insurance money from the necklace.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
Let's get it out.

23:06.840 --> 23:10.040
I don't care who buys the weapons
or where they end up.

23:10.840 --> 23:14.720
-He's responsible for the attack.
-We've got him.

23:15.320 --> 23:16.160
He's a goner.

23:18.320 --> 23:21.120
We'll use Twitter.
In 24 hours, everyone will know.

23:23.560 --> 23:26.520
This is big, Fabienne. It's intense.

23:28.480 --> 23:29.560
Where'd you find it?

23:30.560 --> 23:33.240
A good journalist
never reveals her sources.

23:36.080 --> 23:38.640
-It's an economics lesson--
-That's perfect.

23:38.720 --> 23:40.240
It's a charity dinner!

23:40.320 --> 23:43.440
You want to attract donors?
They need to have trust.

23:43.520 --> 23:45.760
It needs to be fiscally interesting.

23:45.840 --> 23:48.760
-That's the way it is.
-Stop it. This is nonsense.

23:49.360 --> 23:51.320
Let's have
a more cheerful background color.

23:52.840 --> 23:54.600
What's the matter? Are you bored?

23:56.160 --> 23:57.160
What's going on?

23:58.560 --> 23:59.920
Are we disturbing you?

24:00.640 --> 24:02.560
Could you please leave us alone?

24:04.600 --> 24:05.640
What's going on?

24:08.960 --> 24:09.800
Thank you.

24:12.320 --> 24:14.600
-Can you explain?
-You explain to me.

24:14.680 --> 24:16.280
This was posted on Twitter.

24:20.400 --> 24:21.720
What's this ultimatum?

24:25.440 --> 24:26.920
It's easy. We have to delete it.

24:27.920 --> 24:31.480
Who is this Salvator813?
It's a fake account. It's anonymous.

24:31.560 --> 24:34.200
-Do you know what this is about?
-Absolutely not.

24:34.280 --> 24:37.320
Why delete the tweet
if you don't know what this is about?

24:37.400 --> 24:41.040
I don't want the world to think
we have something to hide!

24:41.120 --> 24:44.840
-Yeah? When it's not the case?
-When it's not the case. Exactly.

24:46.520 --> 24:48.880
This foundation means a lot to me.

24:48.960 --> 24:50.160
I am invested,

24:50.240 --> 24:54.120
so if something could compromise it,
you need to tell me.

24:54.200 --> 24:55.400
There is nothing.

24:57.640 --> 24:58.680
Do you promise?

25:00.160 --> 25:02.000
Would I lie to my own daughter?

25:06.880 --> 25:08.600
It was retweeted 2,000 times.

25:19.520 --> 25:20.360
Come in.

25:26.080 --> 25:29.200
-You going out?
-I'm having drinks with girlfriends.

25:29.280 --> 25:30.920
If they waited for me.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.120
Raoul is in his room. See you later.

25:34.480 --> 25:35.480
See you later.

25:40.320 --> 25:41.760
Did you finish the book?

25:42.400 --> 25:44.880
Yeah, it was awesome.
I even started the others.

25:45.960 --> 25:46.800
That's cool.

25:47.760 --> 25:50.480
I wanted to give you the set
for your birthday.

25:50.560 --> 25:52.000
I'll find something else.

25:53.920 --> 25:55.800
I'll dazzle you and your mom.

25:55.880 --> 25:58.440
I doubt it.
With all the dates she goes on.

25:59.640 --> 26:00.480
What dates?

26:01.400 --> 26:03.840
She's already seen tonight's guy.

26:04.560 --> 26:06.400
Tonight is girls' night, right?

26:07.440 --> 26:08.280
Dad…

26:08.800 --> 26:09.640
Oh yeah?

26:13.640 --> 26:14.600
Good for her.

26:18.280 --> 26:20.440
-Who's the guy?
-A doctor, I think.

26:21.400 --> 26:23.920
Pretty good-looking too. He's got money.

26:26.560 --> 26:29.120
-That helps.
-And his ride is dope.

26:30.120 --> 26:31.280
How do you know all this?

26:31.880 --> 26:34.400
-Have you met him?
-He's stayed the night.

26:34.480 --> 26:36.240
-What? When?
-I'm kidding!

26:37.120 --> 26:38.320
You know, Mom talks.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.800
Because she's happy.

26:42.240 --> 26:43.160
Good for her.

26:44.040 --> 26:46.920
Stop pretending you don't care.
It's pissing me off.

26:49.040 --> 26:50.960
Boom. Head shot! You suck.

27:00.480 --> 27:03.360
A day after the mysterious tweet
from the anonymous Salvator,

27:03.440 --> 27:06.080
we are live from Hubert Pellegrini's home,

27:06.160 --> 27:08.480
where a press conference is starting.

27:08.560 --> 27:10.080
Mr. Pellegrini!

27:12.600 --> 27:13.440
France

27:14.560 --> 27:16.520
is a country one can be proud of.

27:17.240 --> 27:19.800
Our economy, our culture
are envied, copied.

27:19.880 --> 27:22.480
Our influence over the world
remains strong.

27:22.560 --> 27:23.680
And yet,

27:24.440 --> 27:27.520
for some time now,
some have tried to damage

27:27.600 --> 27:29.040
our country's image

27:29.720 --> 27:33.320
and those who, like myself,
love and defend it.

27:34.200 --> 27:36.800
I built my company on work and effort.

27:36.880 --> 27:38.760
I pay my taxes in France.

27:38.840 --> 27:40.840
I am a philanthropist.

27:40.920 --> 27:41.920
Despite all that,

27:42.800 --> 27:47.080
yesterday someone launched
a nauseating and anonymous rumor.

27:47.920 --> 27:51.000
This rumor puts my integrity
and that of my company in doubt.

27:52.160 --> 27:53.080
Usually,

27:53.160 --> 27:56.840
the one who calls himself Salvator813

27:56.920 --> 27:59.920
wouldn't deserve my attention, my energy.

28:00.560 --> 28:02.320
I'm standing before you today

28:03.120 --> 28:05.000
because my own daughter

28:06.600 --> 28:10.800
and the foundation she will launch
to help youths

28:10.880 --> 28:12.680
are threatened by this rumor.

28:13.400 --> 28:14.680
I cannot accept that.

28:15.320 --> 28:19.640
So if this Salvator
wants to create a scandal,

28:19.720 --> 28:22.920
if he's convinced
that what he's saying is the truth,

28:23.480 --> 28:26.320
and that the world must know,
I have one question.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.600
Why remain in the shadows?

28:30.000 --> 28:31.760
Come out. Show yourself.

28:32.520 --> 28:34.560
I have nothing to hide.

28:35.080 --> 28:36.280
If that's your case,

28:37.560 --> 28:38.520
prove it.

28:39.200 --> 28:41.480
-Thank you.
-Mr. Pellegrini!

28:41.560 --> 28:42.560
Mr. Pellegrini?

28:43.280 --> 28:45.560
Do you have the blood

28:45.640 --> 28:48.120
of the Kuala Lumpur victims on your hands?

28:53.000 --> 28:55.480
-That wasn't planned.
-She'll be caught. She's crazy.

28:57.560 --> 29:00.560
That's all I had to say. Thank you.

29:00.640 --> 29:02.360
Mr. Pellegrini!

29:02.440 --> 29:03.720
Please!

29:08.760 --> 29:09.840
What a woman.

30:18.320 --> 30:19.360
Well done.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.880
Come on, you shouldn't have.

30:22.520 --> 30:24.720
-Honestly.
-You were amazing.

30:25.720 --> 30:27.440
It felt so good!

30:29.520 --> 30:33.480
I've been hiding for ten years,
and I'm in the middle of the action.

30:34.840 --> 30:36.400
That loser Brizac.

30:36.960 --> 30:39.960
-The one you see on all the TV shows?
-Yeah.

30:40.040 --> 30:41.680
He tried to ask a question.

30:41.760 --> 30:43.280
No way, mister!

30:43.360 --> 30:46.200
Fabienne Bériot is the one
asking the right question!

30:46.280 --> 30:48.960
Before everybody else!
Like in the old days.

30:49.040 --> 30:52.320
One of Pellegrini's guys
tried to follow me.

30:52.400 --> 30:54.600
-What?
-Don't worry. I lost him.

30:55.680 --> 30:59.040
-Are you sure?
-Listen. I have experience.

30:59.880 --> 31:02.360
I know how to lose a tail.

31:03.800 --> 31:05.440
All right, what's next?

31:05.520 --> 31:06.720
We out him.

31:06.800 --> 31:08.840
We post the entire video online.

31:08.920 --> 31:11.560
Better yet, I contacted The Other Edition.

31:13.440 --> 31:16.280
I told them
Salvator wanted to make his TV debut.

31:17.640 --> 31:18.720
The Other Edition?

31:21.560 --> 31:23.040
That's not journalism.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.080
Two million viewers every night.

31:26.840 --> 31:28.920
These people will know the truth.

31:29.040 --> 31:31.360
-You can't shut up two million people.
-OK.

31:31.440 --> 31:33.960
-I'm ready.
-I know. But no.

31:35.760 --> 31:37.360
Tomorrow, I'll be Salvator.

31:38.280 --> 31:40.440
Are you kidding? I'm going with you!

31:40.520 --> 31:43.800
I dragged you into this.
You have already done a lot.

31:45.440 --> 31:47.040
It's my turn to take risks.

31:49.080 --> 31:50.400
I owe it to my father.

31:52.920 --> 31:54.480
What was your father like?

31:56.720 --> 31:57.560
Proud.

31:58.400 --> 31:59.240
Upright.

32:00.600 --> 32:02.040
He was stubborn too.

32:04.040 --> 32:05.360
Reminds me of someone.

32:05.880 --> 32:07.600
I don't know what you mean.

32:07.680 --> 32:09.000
Let's get to work.

32:11.040 --> 32:13.400
Time to get Salvator out of the shadows.

32:19.720 --> 32:22.200
-Were your witnesses drunk?
-I'm sorry?

32:22.840 --> 32:24.800
None of them looks like my abductor.

32:24.880 --> 32:26.760
They look like four different guys!

32:27.520 --> 32:28.480
What about him?

32:31.600 --> 32:34.320
I took the forensic identification guy
to Vincent Morville.

32:36.200 --> 32:40.520
Sernine's Louvre accomplice.
He gave us a very detailed description.

32:42.440 --> 32:43.440
That's not him either.

32:45.400 --> 32:46.840
For the last time,

32:46.920 --> 32:49.200
stop trying to connect both cases.

32:49.280 --> 32:51.120
It's going nowhere.

32:51.680 --> 32:54.120
-It's him.
-No, it's not him.

32:54.200 --> 32:59.320
What he's trying to say clumsily
is that he likes to change his appearance.

32:59.400 --> 33:01.880
And you like to take me for a fool!

33:01.960 --> 33:03.800
The theft was three weeks ago.

33:03.880 --> 33:07.440
You haven't made any progress!
I'm putting another team on this.

33:07.520 --> 33:09.000
No, we can do this.

33:09.600 --> 33:11.960
You two. You have one week, no longer.

33:12.040 --> 33:13.960
-Us two?
-You know what I meant.

33:34.240 --> 33:36.480
Did you see his face
when he saw the last sketch?

33:36.560 --> 33:37.760
What did you think?

33:39.680 --> 33:42.160
-It's super shady.
-Thank you, we agree.

33:42.240 --> 33:44.120
We can't investigate our commissioner.

33:44.640 --> 33:47.480
What? Who is this? It's him!

33:47.560 --> 33:51.160
-There's our suspect.
-Hey, Guédira. Drop it now, OK?

33:51.240 --> 33:53.240
You heard Dumont. You're off the case.

33:54.080 --> 33:55.000
OK?

34:05.160 --> 34:06.080
Latex sponge.

34:08.560 --> 34:09.400
Thanks.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.240
-Did someone teach you makeup?
-No.

34:16.600 --> 34:18.520
I managed on my own. I often do.

34:20.480 --> 34:21.480
Brush number 12?

34:27.240 --> 34:28.680
You been living here long?

34:30.480 --> 34:33.200
-Is this an interrogation?
-No. Sorry.

34:33.280 --> 34:34.880
Occupational habit.

34:36.080 --> 34:37.200
Blending brush.

34:38.480 --> 34:39.800
Thanks.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.080
Come on, Fabienne.

34:43.160 --> 34:45.200
This is for blurring, not blending.

34:45.280 --> 34:47.440
-You're serious?
-Yes, I'm serious.

34:48.360 --> 34:50.680
I never joke around with makeup. There.

34:51.800 --> 34:53.000
Yes, that's the one.

34:53.800 --> 34:54.640
By the way…

34:57.000 --> 34:57.960
this is for you.

34:58.880 --> 35:01.760
-To thank you.
-I don't need a reward.

35:01.840 --> 35:03.160
I knew you'd say that.

35:04.640 --> 35:05.640
It's my pleasure.

35:15.760 --> 35:17.880
I hope it'll make you want to write again.

35:18.680 --> 35:21.400
You know,
the first time you came to my place,

35:22.440 --> 35:26.440
I wasn't lying
when I said I wasn't Fabienne Bériot.

35:28.240 --> 35:30.280
I hadn't been that woman in years.

35:34.760 --> 35:37.880
You brought Fabienne Bériot back, Assane.

35:39.800 --> 35:41.120
That's my gift.

35:42.720 --> 35:43.800
Thank you.

35:52.120 --> 35:55.600
Tonight on The Other Edition,
an exclusive interview.

35:55.680 --> 35:56.760
Hubert Pellegrini,

35:56.840 --> 36:00.440
one of the wealthiest
and most generous men in France.

36:01.040 --> 36:03.240
His empire ranges from import-export

36:03.320 --> 36:05.640
to energy and media.

36:05.720 --> 36:07.400
Nothing can resist him.

36:07.480 --> 36:10.080
But our guest tonight is a man

36:10.160 --> 36:12.160
who is questioning his integrity.

36:12.240 --> 36:15.160
We are joined by Salvator.
Good evening, Salvator.

36:16.160 --> 36:17.080
Good evening.

36:17.640 --> 36:21.320
You're showing your face
for the first time.

36:21.400 --> 36:24.120
You're either very brave
or completely insane.

36:25.320 --> 36:26.960
Your viewers will decide.

36:27.040 --> 36:30.480
True. Your appearance is intriguing.
It may startle some.

36:30.560 --> 36:31.920
We weren't expecting

36:32.520 --> 36:33.360
this.

36:34.640 --> 36:36.560
-What do you mean?
-You are…

36:36.640 --> 36:38.000
-Old?
-Aged.

36:38.560 --> 36:41.880
When you have a Twitter account
and you battle injustice,

36:42.600 --> 36:44.040
they expect a young person.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.680
You're forgetting something.

36:47.280 --> 36:50.320
Most people in this country
are older than you.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.280
OK. You got your message across.

36:53.360 --> 36:56.800
You came here tonight with a videotape

36:56.880 --> 36:59.200
that is allegedly compromising.

36:59.280 --> 37:03.000
Mr. Pellegrini even came out
of his legendary retreat

37:03.080 --> 37:05.400
to say he's not afraid of this video.

37:06.400 --> 37:08.640
-That's right.
-Tell us more about it.

37:08.720 --> 37:12.600
What is on this recording?
Even I don't know. Let's be candid.

37:12.680 --> 37:17.000
You'll see. This is footage
from a meeting that took place in 1996.

37:17.600 --> 37:18.440
In Malaysia.

37:19.200 --> 37:22.680
You can see Hubert Pellegrini
illegally selling weapons

37:23.760 --> 37:27.560
to the terrorists who attacked
the French embassy at the time.

37:28.120 --> 37:28.960
Really?

37:30.280 --> 37:32.400
Well, let's all watch this video.

37:39.760 --> 37:41.240
My situation has evolved.

37:42.280 --> 37:44.160
That's the way it is.

37:44.840 --> 37:47.720
If you want a deal,
you must keep your promise.

37:50.240 --> 37:51.240
Impossible.

37:52.480 --> 37:54.400
I'm warning you, this is over.

37:55.760 --> 37:56.760
Forget this deal.

38:02.280 --> 38:03.360
All of that for this?

38:05.120 --> 38:09.000
I'm confused.
There's nothing compromising.

38:12.600 --> 38:14.240
I don't understand your accusations.

38:15.600 --> 38:19.360
Clearly the cat's got Salvator's tongue.

38:19.440 --> 38:22.280
We'll be back after the commercial.
Stay tuned.

38:22.880 --> 38:23.880
Assholes!

38:23.960 --> 38:25.320
How much did he pay you?

38:25.400 --> 38:28.400
-Enough with the conspiracy act.
-Piece of shit.

39:10.720 --> 39:12.160
But I don't give a damn!

39:12.240 --> 39:14.680
Turn the building upside down.
I need him!

39:16.080 --> 39:17.000
I'll call back.

39:18.760 --> 39:20.080
-Yes, sweetheart.
-Dad?

39:20.160 --> 39:21.320
I told you, right?

39:22.240 --> 39:25.120
-A pack of lies.
-I saw.

39:25.200 --> 39:26.200
I'm sorry.

39:26.280 --> 39:28.000
I have to tell you something.

39:28.600 --> 39:29.560
This Salvator,

39:30.360 --> 39:31.840
I think I know who it is.

39:33.640 --> 39:34.640
How so?

39:35.240 --> 39:36.360
I'm not sure,

39:37.200 --> 39:39.240
but I think it's Assane Diop.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.480
You know, Babakar's son.

39:45.600 --> 39:47.400
It was him at the gardens.

39:48.280 --> 39:49.600
He stole the necklace.

39:50.880 --> 39:52.480
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

39:52.560 --> 39:54.720
I don't know. I should have, but…

39:56.560 --> 39:57.760
Nothing makes sense.

39:57.840 --> 40:00.360
-What does he want from us?
-To destroy us.

40:02.280 --> 40:03.520
I won't let him.

40:04.160 --> 40:07.240
He's held me responsible
for the death of his father.

40:07.320 --> 40:08.320
It needs to stop.

40:09.360 --> 40:10.200
OK.

40:19.240 --> 40:21.920
The elites have outwitted us once again,
J'accuse.

40:22.800 --> 40:24.520
We won't let them get us twice.

41:00.520 --> 41:03.960
We'll make him some coffee,
J'accuse. To cheer him up.

41:05.920 --> 41:07.720
And then we'll set out again.

41:16.960 --> 41:18.040
Evening, Fabienne.

41:20.200 --> 41:23.000
Mr. Pellegrini wants
Assane Diop's address.

41:23.760 --> 41:24.880
-Who?
-Salvator.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.760
-I have no idea.
-Quit wasting my time.

41:28.840 --> 41:30.600
We thought you'd learned your lesson.

41:31.480 --> 41:32.440
I'll be clearer.

41:34.360 --> 41:35.480
Where does he live?

41:36.440 --> 41:38.240
Tell me now, or I'll take care of you.

41:40.440 --> 41:43.280
Last chance! Assane Diop's address!

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
Where is he?

41:52.560 --> 41:54.280
A good journalist

41:55.120 --> 41:57.120
never reveals her sources.

41:59.800 --> 42:01.360
I don't get you, Fabienne.

42:19.680 --> 42:20.640
What's going on?

42:27.720 --> 42:28.560
Fabienne.

43:33.360 --> 43:34.760
My dear Assane,

43:37.680 --> 43:39.800
tonight, we may have lost a battle.

43:40.800 --> 43:43.400
But I know you. You won't give up.

43:51.120 --> 43:54.000
You know the difference
between good and evil.

43:54.080 --> 43:55.480
You never give up,

43:57.000 --> 44:00.600
in spite of the danger
and the forces trying to stop you.

44:02.240 --> 44:04.280
That's why I admire you.

44:05.800 --> 44:07.200
We're going to fight.

44:08.000 --> 44:09.720
For your father, your family.

44:09.800 --> 44:13.080
For ourselves.
We're going to fight, Assane.

44:14.720 --> 44:15.720
Together.

44:17.240 --> 44:18.680
Your friend, Fabienne.

44:23.000 --> 44:23.840
It's you.
