Once Upon A Time...

00:03.546 --> 00:06.879
Things we haven't thought about
in years

00:06.966 --> 00:09.298
still have the ability to make us cry.

00:09.427 --> 00:12.419
If you're here for the boy,
you will not survive.

00:12.555 --> 00:15.422
The question is how many of you
I take with me.

(GRUNTING)

01:17.119 --> 01:18.780
You know what to do.

01:18.871 --> 01:23.160

Not even me.

(VARIOUS ANIMAL NOISES)

01:43.938 --> 01:47.146
The ridge is just
a few hundred paces up ahead.

01:47.233 --> 01:49.315
You really think we're gonna be able to
see Pan's hideout?

01:49.402 --> 01:51.017
From there,
we should be able to see everything.

01:51.112 --> 01:52.943
Including where he's keeping your son.

01:53.030 --> 01:56.614
You know, I could havejust poofed us
up here in an instant.

01:56.701 --> 02:00.319
Where? Have you any idea
what's up here? Or anywhere?

02:00.413 --> 02:02.028
There are dangers all about.

02:02.123 --> 02:04.739
Only I can guide us past them.

02:04.834 --> 02:06.290
He's right. Hook's lived here before.

02:06.377 --> 02:09.619
If he says hiking up is the best way,
then we listen.

02:09.714 --> 02:11.204
Here. You need to stay hydrated.

02:11.299 --> 02:12.414
Thanks, Mary Margaret.

02:13.634 --> 02:16.296
You know, Mary Margaret's a bit formal.

02:17.346 --> 02:19.462
You could call me "mom" if you want.

02:19.557 --> 02:21.047
You've done it before.

02:21.142 --> 02:23.428
That was back when we were...

02:23.519 --> 02:27.432
...we were about to die. Oh, no, | get it.

02:35.156 --> 02:36.566
No. No!

02:37.700 --> 02:39.986
I can handle a couple of thorns.

02:40.077 --> 02:41.487
That's dreamshade.

02:41.579 --> 02:43.160
It's not the thorns
you have to worry about.

02:43.247 --> 02:44.908
It's the poison they inject you with.

02:45.249 --> 02:48.662
This plant is the source of the toxins
| used on the Dark One.

02:48.753 --> 02:50.243
The poison that almost killed Gold?

02:50.338 --> 02:51.373
Indeed.

02:51.464 --> 02:53.000
| used a concentrated dose.

02:53.090 --> 02:54.079
In its natural form,

02:54.175 --> 02:56.541
death would be much slower
and far more painful.

02:56.761 --> 02:58.297
| suggest we go this way.

03:00.765 --> 03:01.754
We'll go this way.

03:07.813 --> 03:09.428
Your father's a distrustful fellow.

03:10.191 --> 03:11.977
He's just not used to working
with the bad guys.

03:12.109 --> 03:14.316
I can assure you, on this island,
I am not the bad guy.

03:14.445 --> 03:16.481
Yeah, well,
Pan's not supposed to be one either.

03:16.614 --> 03:18.024
What possibly gave you that idea?

03:18.115 --> 03:19.855
Every story I ever heard as a child.

03:19.950 --> 03:21.486
Well, they got it wrong.

03:21.619 --> 03:23.735
Pan is the most treacherous villain
I've ever faced.

03:23.829 --> 03:25.569
Listen, tell me something, love,

03:25.664 --> 03:30.124
in these stories, what was I like?

03:30.211 --> 03:32.623
Other than a villain.
Handsome, I gather?

03:32.797 --> 03:35.129
If waxed moustaches and perms
are your thing.

03:36.967 --> 03:39.629
I take it by your tone, perms are bad?

DAVID: Up here.

03:42.473 --> 03:43.508
We made it.

03:50.398 --> 03:52.229

03:55.277 --> 03:57.188
Aye. The Dark Jungle.

04:01.158 --> 04:04.867
lt's, uh, grown somewhat
since I last stepped foot in Neverland.

04:04.995 --> 04:07.247
(SIGHS) So this nature hike
was for nothing?

04:07.331 --> 04:08.992
Hook may have led us astray,

04:09.125 --> 04:12.333
but at least we're in a good position
to start combing the Jungle.

04:12.837 --> 04:13.872
Not exactly.

04:14.004 --> 04:17.337
The Dark Jungle is the last place
you want to set foot.

04:17.466 --> 04:18.581
We'll have to go around it.

04:18.676 --> 04:20.507
In order to do that,
we're going to need our strength.

04:20.636 --> 04:22.137
| suggest we make camp.

04:22.221 --> 04:25.679
You want to sleep
while my son is out there suffering?

04:25.850 --> 04:27.886
If you want to live long enough
to save the boy,

04:29.019 --> 04:30.884
yes.

04:38.529 --> 04:39.564
You okay?

04:39.697 --> 04:41.779
Regina's right.
Henry's out there somewhere.

04:41.866 --> 04:42.901
And Hook is right.

04:43.993 --> 04:46.200
We have to survive
if we're going to get him.

04:46.328 --> 04:47.317
I know.

04:48.747 --> 04:51.079
| just hope we're not too late.

04:51.208 --> 04:53.369
After everything your father and l
have been through,

04:53.502 --> 04:55.163
there's one thing we've learned.

04:55.588 --> 04:57.544
It is never too late.

05:05.389 --> 05:07.425

No. I'm going to help you find him.

See, it's not about finding Henry.

10:41.391 --> 10:42.767
It's about how you find him.

And, Emma,
you are the only one who can.

10:56.615 --> 10:57.695

Did I protect them today?

I couldn't even help that poor girl.

And don't kid yourself, she isn't
going to stop with the peasants.

She's going to come after the people
who are closest to me.

12:49.728 --> 12:51.434
Even if it means our death.

12:51.521 --> 12:52.806
Which it probably will.

12:55.025 --> 12:57.232
You can't let her get into your head.

12:57.361 --> 13:00.194
She has a point. I'm no queen.

13:00.322 --> 13:01.437
I'm no leader.

13:01.531 --> 13:03.362
I'm just a girl who lost her parents,

13:03.492 --> 13:05.403
ran away into the woods
and became a bandit.

13:05.535 --> 13:06.945
-You're Snow White.
-Yes,

13:07.037 --> 13:11.747
and the truth is,
I don't even know who that is.

13:14.044 --> 13:16.251
But I know what I don't want to be.
And that is alone.

13:17.047 --> 13:18.207
That's never going to happen.

13:20.050 --> 13:21.039
You're right.

13:22.552 --> 13:24.338
If we take her offer,
we can all live together.

13:24.429 --> 13:28.172
In exile, but at least we'll be alive.
We should leave. Tomorrow.

13:29.226 --> 13:30.261
-Snow...
-Let her go.

13:30.394 --> 13:32.680
This is her kingdom.
We can'tjust let her walk away from it.

13:32.854 --> 13:34.810
Why do you suddenly care so much
about saving Snow's kingdom?

13:34.898 --> 13:35.887
What do you mean?

13:35.983 --> 13:37.018
Well, if you have true love,

13:37.109 --> 13:39.725
what difference does it make whether
you live in a castle or on a farm?

13:41.738 --> 13:43.729
Wait, you think I'm in this for her crown?

13:43.865 --> 13:45.401
You said it, not me.

13:46.451 --> 13:48.567
Okay. Okay, I get it. I'm new.

13:48.704 --> 13:50.615
But trust me,
I want what's best for Snow.

13:50.747 --> 13:55.036
Look, handsome, she may love you,
but that chiseled chin ain't fooling us.

13:55.127 --> 13:56.788
We got our eyes on you.

13:58.380 --> 14:00.541
Are you dwarfs with me or against me?

14:00.632 --> 14:02.042
I think Grumpy was pretty clear.

14:02.134 --> 14:05.342
Sorry, brother,
Snow's already made up her mind.

14:05.429 --> 14:08.136
So if you're looking to change it,
you gotta do it without our help.

14:09.057 --> 14:10.046
(SIGHS)

14:20.110 --> 14:21.600
Then I'll find another way.

14:26.992 --> 14:30.780
You again? Didn't ljust help you
wake your princess?

14:32.581 --> 14:35.368
And now I need your help once more.

14:35.459 --> 14:41.250
Long ago, you made Snow remember
who she was when a spell blinded her.

14:41.339 --> 14:42.419
I need you to do it again.

14:49.306 --> 14:50.295
(RUSTLING)

14:55.479 --> 14:56.685
Who's there?

14:57.981 --> 14:59.562
(RUSTLING CONTINUES)

15:00.650 --> 15:02.106
Show yourself.

15:04.154 --> 15:05.644
That doesn't belong to you, dearie.

15:11.828 --> 15:12.863
Belle?

15:17.709 --> 15:21.702
Belle, I don't understand.
How did you get here?

15:21.838 --> 15:23.954
I thought you didn't dress
like that anymore?

15:24.049 --> 15:25.380
I thought that was your past.

15:25.509 --> 15:26.999
Well, this is now my future.

15:27.135 --> 15:29.000
Becoming this again,

15:29.137 --> 15:33.506
the Dark One, that's the only way
I'll save my grandson.

15:35.477 --> 15:39.390
But you haven't completely
become him, have you?

15:39.523 --> 15:42.356
(WHISPERS) There's still hope.

15:45.570 --> 15:46.559
(GASPS) Oh.

15:48.406 --> 15:49.862
You're not really here, are you?

15:50.867 --> 15:51.856
No, of course not.

15:51.993 --> 15:54.780
I'm still in Storybrooke,
right where you left me.

15:54.871 --> 15:56.327
Are you okay?

15:56.456 --> 15:58.412
Did the protection spell work?

15:58.542 --> 16:00.828
It did. And we're all fine.

16:00.919 --> 16:02.875
Storybrooke is safe. We all are.

16:03.004 --> 16:07.714
How do I know these aren'tjust lies
meant to lead me astray?

16:08.385 --> 16:12.970
How do I know Pan didn't conjure up
a vision of you?

16:13.056 --> 16:14.091
He didn't.

16:15.100 --> 16:16.089
You did.

16:16.226 --> 16:17.215
What?

16:18.395 --> 16:20.056
The question is why.

16:22.274 --> 16:23.263
PRINCE CHARMING:
You must have something

16:23.358 --> 16:24.347
that can change Snow's mind.

16:24.442 --> 16:27.434
If she doesn't want to fight the Queen,
there's nothing I can do to change that.

16:27.571 --> 16:31.109
ljust need a way to make her believe
in something that I already know,

16:31.241 --> 16:33.402
that she can face Regina and win.

16:33.535 --> 16:36.277
Magic can't make
someone believe, dearie.

16:36.413 --> 16:38.369
It works the other way around.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.739
Belief must come from within.

16:41.877 --> 16:44.584
You know,
the Queen's offer was a fair one.

16:45.255 --> 16:47.120
Do yourself a favor and take it.

16:47.257 --> 16:49.213
Ruling a kingdom
ain't all it's cracked up to be.

16:49.301 --> 16:50.541
Just ask your dear old brother.

16:51.261 --> 16:54.298
Oh, wait, he died. You see my point.

16:54.598 --> 16:55.587
(GIGGLES)

16:57.309 --> 17:00.551
No. I didn't come here
to take no for an answer.

17:00.729 --> 17:02.936
Now, you must have something.
You always do.

17:04.774 --> 17:07.106
Just name your price.

17:16.745 --> 17:18.076
Save those arrows for the Queen.

17:18.163 --> 17:21.075
I told you. I've already
made up my mind. We're leaving.

17:21.166 --> 17:23.498
Not when you hear
what Rumplestiltskin had to say.

17:23.627 --> 17:28.291
You, more than anyone, know that
his deals always come with a price.

17:28.423 --> 17:30.129
And sometimes that price
is worth paying.

17:30.258 --> 17:33.295
Without his help,
you'd still be in that glass coffin.

17:35.180 --> 17:36.761
What did he say this time?

17:37.432 --> 17:40.424
He told me of a legend.
A magical weapon.

17:40.518 --> 17:42.804
One that can help you
reclaim your kingdom.

17:44.314 --> 17:46.521
Unless he can guarantee more lives
won't be lost,

17:47.943 --> 17:49.228
I'm not interested.

17:49.319 --> 17:52.106
The weapon is only a half-day's ride
from here.

17:52.197 --> 17:54.313
We can be there before sundown.

17:59.162 --> 18:00.493
This weapon...

18:00.956 --> 18:02.446
(SCOFFS)

18:02.666 --> 18:05.658
You say it will help me defeat Regina?
How?

18:07.170 --> 18:10.207
By showing her who you really are.

18:15.303 --> 18:17.840
My name is Emma Swan.

18:18.014 --> 18:23.008
I'd wager the solution to Pan's riddle
is a bit more complicated than that.

18:23.186 --> 18:25.222
(CREATURE HOWLING IN DISTANCE)

18:25.355 --> 18:26.845
Don't hold anything back.

18:32.821 --> 18:34.186
I'm Henry's mother.

18:34.364 --> 18:37.527
I used to live in Boston,
and I was a bail bondsperson.

18:37.659 --> 18:39.900
I'm now the sheriff of Storybrooke.

18:40.036 --> 18:43.028
That election was a sham.
Are we really doing this?

18:43.164 --> 18:47.498
Don't you think maybe
that you're leaving some things out?

18:49.379 --> 18:50.915
(CLEARS THROAT)

18:51.381 --> 18:53.542
I'm the daughter of Snow White
and Prince Charming.

18:54.342 --> 18:57.880
Which apparently makes me
the product of true love.

18:59.055 --> 19:02.218
I was born in the enchanted forest,

19:02.309 --> 19:05.551
and I was sent through a portal in a tree,

19:05.645 --> 19:07.886
so that I could break a curse.

19:08.898 --> 19:12.390
And you were able
to break the curse because...

19:12.610 --> 19:13.690
(WHISPERS) You're the...

19:14.904 --> 19:16.235
Come on, you don't need to be
embarrassed to say it.

19:16.573 --> 19:17.733
Say what?

19:17.824 --> 19:18.904
The S-word.

19:27.917 --> 19:29.293
I'm the Savior.

19:39.054 --> 19:40.043
(DAVID SIGHS)

19:42.140 --> 19:43.425
EMMA: I don't get it.
I said I'm the Savior.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.256
There's nothing I've denied
more than that.

19:45.352 --> 19:46.387
No, it's okay. We'll figure it out.

19:46.478 --> 19:47.638
No, you won't.

19:47.771 --> 19:48.760
Regina!

19:48.938 --> 19:50.098
But I can.

19:51.107 --> 19:52.483
I'm beginning to think
there isn't a map on here.

19:54.152 --> 19:55.517
But that doesn't mean it can't lead us
to Henry.

19:55.612 --> 19:58.319
I thought we decided that using magic
was a bad idea.

19:58.448 --> 20:00.484
For once I agree with the Prince.

20:00.617 --> 20:02.482
Well, I told you we were getting along.

20:04.621 --> 20:05.656
What the hell are you doing?

20:05.789 --> 20:06.869
A Iocator spell.

20:06.956 --> 20:10.995
This parchment belonged to Pan.
It will lead us to him.

20:21.471 --> 20:25.089
So it appears we will be venturing
into the Dark Jungle after all.

20:25.183 --> 20:27.265
You mean the place you told us
never to set foot?

20:27.352 --> 20:28.683
That's the one.

20:28.853 --> 20:32.812
Well, Emma, you said
you wanted to be the leader?

20:34.818 --> 20:36.024
Lead.

20:55.004 --> 20:58.496
BELLE: So do you know why
you brought me to the island?

20:58.633 --> 21:00.749
I thought you were going to show me
the answer.

21:00.844 --> 21:02.835
Only you know that.

21:04.722 --> 21:06.258
(SIGHS) I've already told you.

21:06.349 --> 21:07.384
No, you haven't.

21:07.475 --> 21:09.011
-I have no idea.
-Yes, you do.

21:09.102 --> 21:10.091
-No.
-You're holding back.

21:10.186 --> 21:11.141
-l'm not!
-You are!

21:11.229 --> 21:14.346
-Belle!
-What is it you're not saying?

21:18.027 --> 21:22.771
I'm a coward. I'm just like my father.

21:22.866 --> 21:24.572
You feel better now, don't you?

21:24.701 --> 21:26.532
You know why I'm here.

21:28.413 --> 21:30.028
You always saw the good in me.

21:30.165 --> 21:32.076
(CHUCKLES) I still do.

21:32.208 --> 21:34.039
And, as much as you deny it,

21:34.169 --> 21:37.411
I think you see it, too.

21:38.339 --> 21:41.706
So why am I here?
What are you wrestling with?

21:43.595 --> 21:45.881
Pan offered me a deal.

21:46.014 --> 21:50.053
I let him keep Henry,
and he allows me to live.

21:50.143 --> 21:53.476
The boy needn't be my undoing.

21:54.314 --> 21:56.475
And you're afraid
you'll make the selfish choice.

21:56.566 --> 21:58.898
I generally do.

21:59.027 --> 22:03.646
You abandoned your son, Baelfire,
and regretted it your whole life.

22:03.740 --> 22:05.901
You don't need to do the same to Henry.

22:08.036 --> 22:13.030
Letting go of the past? It's the first step.

22:19.005 --> 22:21.997
You know, this was the last thing
my father gave me.

22:22.091 --> 22:23.592
What happened to him?

22:26.429 --> 22:27.589
He left me.

22:29.224 --> 22:33.012
If you don't want to repeat the mistakes
he made,

22:33.603 --> 22:35.389
you need to let go.

23:09.889 --> 23:11.595
REGINA: Ready to thank me?

23:11.724 --> 23:13.305
Actually, yeah.

23:14.269 --> 23:17.477
If you'd let me do it sooner,
maybe we'd have found him by now.

23:20.108 --> 23:22.565
Wait. He's there.

23:22.652 --> 23:25.564
Pan. I can feel his smugness.

23:30.910 --> 23:35.904
Shall we? While we still have
the element of surprise on our side?

23:37.667 --> 23:42.161
Careful. He may look like a boy,
but he's a bloody demon.

23:47.343 --> 23:52.337
Hey. We can do this. You can do this.

23:59.856 --> 24:02.313
PRINCE CHARMING:
We're nearly there.

24:03.526 --> 24:05.812
We should take the rest of the way
on foot.

24:18.875 --> 24:21.833
You realize this is the first time
we've been alone since you proposed.

24:22.545 --> 24:25.127
Well, privacy is a hard thing to come by

24:25.214 --> 24:29.127
when you have seven "big brothers"
keeping an eye on you.

24:29.218 --> 24:30.549
-They're protective.
-(CHUCKLES)

24:30.637 --> 24:32.377
That's one word for it.

24:32.472 --> 24:35.009
Have the dwarfs been
giving you a hard time?

24:35.141 --> 24:36.972
Apart from accusing me of being

24:37.060 --> 24:40.143
a gold-digging,
social-climbing shepherd?

24:40.229 --> 24:41.389
Nah.

24:42.231 --> 24:46.019
I have faith that you'll charm them
just as you charmed me.

24:47.070 --> 24:48.901
-Eventually.
-(CHUCKLES)

PRINCE CHARMING:
According to Rumplestiltskin,

24:52.200 --> 24:55.237
the weapon that will defeat Regina
lies at the top of this hill.

24:55.745 --> 25:00.739
(EXHALES) This weapon...
What does Rumple say of its power?

25:00.875 --> 25:02.740
Was it made with dark magic?

25:02.877 --> 25:07.246
No, it was forged by a benevolent mage.
His name is Merlin.

25:07.382 --> 25:09.088
From a realm called Camelot.

25:09.217 --> 25:11.003

25:33.574 --> 25:37.112
It's stuck. You wanna try?

25:37.245 --> 25:39.861
If you couldn't do it,
you really think I can?

25:39.956 --> 25:44.040
Well, the legend states
only the kingdom's true ruler

25:44.127 --> 25:46.288
possesses the strength to free the blade.

25:47.088 --> 25:48.544

Oh!

You are this kingdom's true leader.

Maybe your spell was wrong, Regina.

26:38.514 --> 26:41.005
Yes. Blame me. Again.

Guys, hold on.

27:08.961 --> 27:10.041
Bad form.

27:10.213 --> 27:12.795
I expect more from you, Captain.

27:12.882 --> 27:14.622
Aye. And you'll get it.

27:14.717 --> 27:15.957
Give Henry to me.

27:16.052 --> 27:17.132
Sorry. Can't.

You planted the sword in that stone?

Idid.

So you took me on an adventure to find
a "magical" sword because?

37:17.361 --> 37:19.898
You needed to believe in something
I already knew.

37:19.988 --> 37:21.524
So when I stood up to Regina...

37:21.615 --> 37:24.231
You did that on your own.

37:24.993 --> 37:27.154
You had it inside you the entire time.

encounter because Pan let us.
