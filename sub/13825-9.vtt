01:13.573 --> 01:18.578
<i>July 4th, 1776. The city: Philadelphia.</i>

01:18.578 --> 01:21.581
<i>The place:
the home of Thomas Jefferson...</i>

01:21.581 --> 01:24.626
<i>...and his cat, who, coincidentally,
is also named Thomas.</i>

01:24.626 --> 01:28.713
<i>The event:
one that will go down in history.</i>

01:28.713 --> 01:31.090
At long last, it is finished.

01:31.090 --> 01:34.010
A declaration
of our colony's independence.

01:34.886 --> 01:37.430
Ho, ho. I shall not be swayed
by your laziness, Tom.

01:37.430 --> 01:41.851
Today is a momentous day,
and I, Thomas Jefferson, must make ready.

02:44.414 --> 02:45.498
There you are.

02:45.498 --> 02:47.500
Have you seen the document
on my desk?

02:47.500 --> 02:50.461
It is of the utmost importance.

02:54.215 --> 02:56.009
You threw it out the window?

02:56.009 --> 03:00.388
The future of the Republic
depends on you getting it back.

03:01.264 --> 03:03.641
Hurry, you dolt!

04:11.250 --> 04:12.627
Huh?

04:14.337 --> 04:17.257
"When in the course of human events...."

04:17.590 --> 04:22.095
This is a declaration of independence.
Why, this is treason.

04:23.262 --> 04:27.767
Who's gonna do the taxation
without representation?

04:27.767 --> 04:29.018
Whoa!

04:47.370 --> 04:50.123
So you're the treasonous dog.

04:50.123 --> 04:52.667
Wait a minute. I'm a dog.

04:52.667 --> 04:55.795
I mean, you're the rebellious pussycat.

04:55.795 --> 04:58.339
Now, hand it over.

05:09.225 --> 05:10.643
Huh?

05:13.688 --> 05:16.733
Youse tricky traitor.

05:26.701 --> 05:32.999
Now, what would be better to clobber
that cat with, bone or cannonball?

05:33.916 --> 05:35.877
Definitely the bone.

05:57.774 --> 05:59.859
<i>Yankee kitty came to town</i>

06:00.193 --> 06:03.029
<i>Treasonous and phony</i>

06:04.447 --> 06:06.741
<i>Offered me a ham on rye</i>

06:06.741 --> 06:09.994
<i>But I prefer bologna</i>

06:52.161 --> 06:54.163
Brothers, rest assured.

06:54.163 --> 06:56.582
My cat
will bring the document posthaste.

06:57.083 --> 06:58.334
Ah, look.

06:58.334 --> 07:00.253
I knew he would not fail me.

07:00.586 --> 07:02.004
Well done, Thomas.

07:02.004 --> 07:07.844
Gentlemen, I give you
the Declaration of Independence.

07:10.388 --> 07:12.723
This is an outrage!
Look!

07:13.224 --> 07:15.393
Hither comes a true patriot.

07:15.852 --> 07:17.478
Thank you, wee sir.

07:17.478 --> 07:19.522
Huzzah!

07:21.232 --> 07:25.111
<i>So on that day, July 4th, 1776...</i>

07:25.111 --> 07:28.781
<i>...the Declaration of Independence
was signed by Congress.</i>

07:28.781 --> 07:30.533
<i>And if you look very closely...</i>

07:31.075 --> 07:33.995
<i>...you'll see it was also signed
by a mouse.</i>

07:45.256 --> 07:48.009
All right, kids. Let's all stay together.

07:48.009 --> 07:51.721
Now, we've seen lots of amazing things
from the history of aviation...

07:51.721 --> 07:53.931
...but I've saved the best for last.

07:54.599 --> 07:57.393
Kind of ironic,
because this was a great first.

07:57.935 --> 08:01.063
There was a time when only birds
had the power of flight.

08:01.689 --> 08:04.775
But then the Wright brothers came along
and invented...

08:04.775 --> 08:07.278
...the very first airplane.

08:07.778 --> 08:10.615
This is the Wright Flyer of 1903.

08:11.032 --> 08:14.952
The plane that gave us
the first moused-flight.

08:15.703 --> 08:18.289
Um, don't you mean "manned" flight?

08:18.289 --> 08:21.209
No, son. The first moused-flight.

08:21.209 --> 08:24.378
Would you like to hear the story
of that courageous mouse?

08:24.378 --> 08:25.713
Oh, yes.

08:25.713 --> 08:26.797
Tell us too.

08:27.423 --> 08:32.386
Well, it all started in the Wright brothers'
bicycle shop in Dayton, Ohio.

08:45.066 --> 08:49.278
Wilbur, do you see
what this bold little mouse is doing?

08:49.737 --> 08:52.573
How rude.
No need to be alarmed, Orville.

08:52.573 --> 08:54.659
I'll call your worthless cat.

08:54.659 --> 08:58.120
Thomas. Please attend
to that meddlesome mouse.

09:14.011 --> 09:15.429
Get that mouse, Thomas.

09:25.481 --> 09:28.192
Did you see that, Orville?
I did, Wilbur. I did.

09:28.609 --> 09:32.196
I think that mouse
knows something of aerodynamics.

09:35.241 --> 09:37.785
And he's terrifically good
at outsmarting Thomas.

09:38.202 --> 09:41.038
The combination of those skills
will help with our experiments.

09:41.580 --> 09:42.707
Let's begin right away.

09:47.086 --> 09:49.630
I hope the mouse
finds our box kite useful.

09:50.006 --> 09:51.048
Look, here he comes.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.217
And your cat is close behind.

10:00.474 --> 10:03.728
Look, Wilbur. The kite's working.

10:03.728 --> 10:07.315
Let's just hope your cat
doesn't create too much drag.

10:17.199 --> 10:18.993
The mouse caught a thermal updraft.

10:30.212 --> 10:34.592
A perfect landing. What excellent flying.

10:34.592 --> 10:36.677
Quick, brother. Let's return to the shop.

10:39.013 --> 10:41.849
Thomas, pick up that kite.

10:47.188 --> 10:51.692
<i>From kites, the Wright brothers
moved up to full-sized gliders...</i>

10:51.692 --> 10:54.236
<i>...big enough to carry a man.</i>

10:56.989 --> 11:00.076
<i>As well as pull a cat.</i>

11:03.537 --> 11:06.248
Now, the Wrights were ready
to make a plane...

11:06.248 --> 11:08.584
...that could take off
under its own power.

11:08.584 --> 11:11.170
But before they built
a full-size version...

11:11.170 --> 11:15.800
...they tested models in a device
they called a wind tunnel.

11:15.800 --> 11:19.470
I simply cannot figure out
what is wrong with the Flyer.

11:19.470 --> 11:22.807
Don't worry, Wilbur.
We can run more tests after lunch.

11:22.807 --> 11:25.309
I've made bouillabaisse.

12:23.659 --> 12:26.829
Oh, dear. Something's wrong
with the wind tunnel.

12:27.705 --> 12:30.291
Wilbur, is our plane all right?

12:30.291 --> 12:33.961
Great Scott! The model's flying,
and with only two wings.

12:33.961 --> 12:35.838
Oh, goody! A biplane!

12:38.299 --> 12:39.467
Whoa!

12:39.467 --> 12:41.469
I got-- Whoa!

12:48.267 --> 12:50.644
<i>With the design
of the Wright Flyer completed...</i>

12:50.644 --> 12:51.896
<i>...the crew packed up...</i>

12:51.896 --> 12:57.026
<i>...and traveled to the testing fields
in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.</i>

12:59.028 --> 13:02.740
This propeller is broken,
and we need two to fly the plane.

13:02.740 --> 13:06.368
Well, then, we just need
to figure out how to fix it.

13:34.188 --> 13:35.439
It's flying.

13:35.898 --> 13:38.275
Where did the mouse
find another propeller?

13:38.859 --> 13:41.362
It's wonderful.
It's thrilling.

13:41.362 --> 13:44.615
It's-- It's coming right at us!

13:44.615 --> 13:46.450
Run!

13:53.541 --> 13:56.961
Don't just stand there, Wilbur.
Take my picture.

13:59.046 --> 14:03.133
And that's just how it happened
on December 17th, 1903.

14:03.676 --> 14:05.844
Well, the humans will get all the credit...

14:05.844 --> 14:09.014
...but it was a mouse
who made the first flight.

14:09.014 --> 14:12.309
But don't you have any proof?
Some corroboration?

14:12.309 --> 14:14.395
Isn't that the way it happened, Tom?

14:15.938 --> 14:20.067
Yep, that's pretty much it, Jer.

14:22.903 --> 14:26.740
Everybody, we'll meet back here
in 15 minutes.

14:50.139 --> 14:52.308
Does you see that, Tom?

14:52.308 --> 14:56.103
Looks like our little mousey friend
has struck gold.

14:56.103 --> 15:00.482
What do you say you and I
go help ourselves to his good fortune?

15:13.954 --> 15:16.498
Gold, gold. We're gonna be rich.

15:17.499 --> 15:20.794
Yee-haw! Gold!
Financial liquidity! Woo-hoo!

15:27.760 --> 15:31.513
If I catch you crooked kittens
jumping anyone else's claim...

15:31.513 --> 15:34.266
...I'll hauls your carcasses to jail.

15:34.266 --> 15:37.019
Does you understand?

15:41.231 --> 15:43.442
Well, that takes care of that.

15:43.442 --> 15:44.693
Don't worry, little guy.

15:44.693 --> 15:48.864
I'm sure
they won't be bothering you anymore.

15:55.704 --> 15:59.416
We gotta find a way to steal
that gold so nobody sees us.

15:59.416 --> 16:04.713
After all, just because that mouse earned it,
doesn't mean he deserves it.

16:17.935 --> 16:19.228
Oh, I get it.

16:19.770 --> 16:25.484
We start a tunnel from our claim
and dig under the river to his gold deposits.

16:26.068 --> 16:28.320
I'll start us off.

16:45.170 --> 16:48.841
Did youse find any gold to steal?

16:49.341 --> 16:50.759
Ahem. Lemonade?

17:07.234 --> 17:08.694
Tom?

17:25.544 --> 17:29.631
So youse got the claim downstream
from the mouse too.

17:30.257 --> 17:32.134
Seems all legal-like.

17:32.134 --> 17:35.220
Make sure you keep it that way.

17:50.778 --> 17:54.156
A wave that size should do nicely,
heh, heh.

18:04.249 --> 18:06.668
Yahoo! We're rich!

18:51.547 --> 18:53.298
Well, that's the last of it.

18:53.298 --> 18:54.967
The rodent's mined out all the gold.

18:55.467 --> 18:59.680
If we're gonna get any, we'll have to stop
him before he makes it to town.

19:00.305 --> 19:01.890
You in?

19:05.352 --> 19:07.771
Okay, Tom. That's plenty of rocks.

19:08.313 --> 19:10.232
I'll mark the spot on the road...

19:10.232 --> 19:12.860
...and when the mouse gets to it,
you pull the rope.

19:24.246 --> 19:27.875
X marks the spot?

19:51.523 --> 19:53.108
Huh?

19:57.946 --> 20:00.032
Well, what do you know? He made it.

20:00.824 --> 20:03.160
We'd better not let him get away.

20:04.036 --> 20:07.289
You first, termite wrangler.

20:07.748 --> 20:12.836
Leaving our financial future
up to a bunch of lazy-loafer insects--

20:18.258 --> 20:20.886
All right. Let's get these doggies moving.

20:23.055 --> 20:25.474
I mean the cattle, Tom. The cattle.

20:33.273 --> 20:34.358
Stampede!

20:48.246 --> 20:49.998
We did it, pal.

20:49.998 --> 20:52.084
Now, let's get this loot to town.

20:57.422 --> 20:59.675
Greetings, boys.
Seems you have quite a haul.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.511
Let's take a look. Hmm.

21:02.511 --> 21:06.431
Sorry, but this is pyrite. Fool's gold.

21:07.099 --> 21:10.185
And this is one of those chocolate coins
wrapped in gold foil.

21:10.185 --> 21:12.187
And this is a gold record, heh.

21:12.187 --> 21:15.357
And this is nothing more than a turkey leg,
painted gold.

21:15.357 --> 21:17.526
You fools are wasting my time.

21:17.526 --> 21:20.445
I got the real gold right here.

21:20.988 --> 21:23.949
Using your cart as a decoy
was a great idea, Jerry.

21:24.491 --> 21:27.953
That way, I could keep the real stuff
safe and sound.

21:29.788 --> 21:33.000
You are going to be
a very wealthy mouse.

21:33.417 --> 21:37.879
And youse claim-jumpers will be
very comfortable in your new home.

21:38.797 --> 21:40.465
In jail!

21:40.465 --> 21:42.509
I knew this was a lousy idea.
