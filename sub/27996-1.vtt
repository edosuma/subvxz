the centrifuge right here

01:11:21.148 --> 01:11:23.248

You know, I never really
told anyone this before,

you, I was scared shitless.

- No. (SNIFFLES)

the moment I held you,

01:11:45.006 --> 01:11:50.242
something inside of me
changed instantly.

01:11:50.244 --> 01:11:51.777

does that.

Dean Bronson spends

01:16:37.532 --> 01:16:39.264
every evening knitting in
the faculty lounge over here.

- Wait, what? He knits?
- I think he used to smoke,

01:16:41.368 --> 01:16:44.236
and then his wife
made him quit, and, uh...

Oh, by the way, shockingly hot.

Right. Sorry.
Um, okay. (CLEARS THROAT)

to his office,

01:16:55.650 --> 01:16:57.650
sneak over to admissions,
break into the dean's office,

01:16:57.652 --> 01:16:59.652

01:17:01.255 --> 01:17:02.387
get Dean Bronson's keys
back to him

without him ever knowing
they were gone,

01:17:03.658 --> 01:17:04.557
