00:01.867 --> 00:03.767
Previously on
"Hit the Floor"...

00:03.833 --> 00:04.900
I'm looking
for Terrence.

00:04.967 --> 00:06.700
I have something
that belongs to him.

00:06.767 --> 00:08.467
The results came back.

00:08.533 --> 00:10.033
The baby's mine.

00:10.100 --> 00:12.667
The house you grew up in--
not in Colorado, here in L.A.

00:12.733 --> 00:15.067
I'll go that house,
tell my story.

00:15.133 --> 00:16.133
But not to him.

00:16.200 --> 00:17.300
To you.

00:17.367 --> 00:18.533
I never said
"I love you" to anyone.

00:18.600 --> 00:19.900
I never said it
to anyone either.

00:19.967 --> 00:21.367
All that
candy-coated garbage.

00:21.433 --> 00:22.667
When did you
become this?

00:22.733 --> 00:25.533
I had no idea
I hurt you this badly.

00:25.600 --> 00:27.933
If we're able to buy the team
then we'll trade Derek.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.000
Let me explain.

00:29.067 --> 00:30.267
Rot on the bench.

00:30.333 --> 00:31.967
These are your
fingerprints.

00:32.033 --> 00:34.200
This is Oscar!
He's setting me up!

00:34.267 --> 00:35.267
There's a gun in
a box by the fireplace.

00:35.333 --> 00:36.400
You have a gun?

00:36.467 --> 00:37.733
I need you to
get rid of it.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.567
We did find something else.

00:39.633 --> 00:42.033
Sloane's signed confession
to killing Olivia Vincent.

00:42.100 --> 00:43.367
But he forced me
to write that!

00:43.433 --> 00:44.633
Sloane Hayes,
you're under arrest

00:44.700 --> 00:45.900
for the murder of
Olivia Vincent.

00:45.967 --> 00:47.033
No!

00:47.100 --> 00:48.300
Did you have
sex with him?

00:48.367 --> 00:49.400
Yes.

00:53.033 --> 00:54.433
Tell me you don't
love him.

00:54.500 --> 00:55.733
I'm sorry.

01:08.967 --> 01:11.567
I've never seen
German so heated.

01:11.633 --> 01:13.400
But I get it.

01:13.467 --> 01:15.833
He had a lot to lose.

01:15.900 --> 01:17.300
The dude's got
a weak right,

01:17.367 --> 01:19.633
but something
he said kind of...

01:19.700 --> 01:23.233
I don't know,
kind of landed.

01:23.300 --> 01:25.633
About me being the kind of
guy that goes after a girl

01:25.700 --> 01:27.700
even if she's
someone else's.

01:27.767 --> 01:29.600
Hey.

01:29.667 --> 01:31.400
I make my own
decisions.

01:33.800 --> 01:38.767
I went back to German months ago
because I wanted to feel safe.

01:38.833 --> 01:41.600
But now I know
there's no such thing.

01:41.667 --> 01:44.333
There's no guarantees.

01:44.400 --> 01:47.867
The only thing I can
trust is my heart...

01:47.933 --> 01:50.433
and it's yours.

01:50.500 --> 01:52.700
It's always been yours.

01:52.767 --> 01:54.633
Yeah?

01:54.700 --> 01:56.867
You're a risk.

01:56.933 --> 01:59.067
But you're a risk
I'm willing to take.

02:10.433 --> 02:12.600
Your lawyer's going
full-throttle on this.

02:12.667 --> 02:13.633
The charge won't stick.

02:13.700 --> 02:15.167
It's already stuck, Pete.

02:15.233 --> 02:16.967
I'm behind bars
for Olivia's murder.

02:17.067 --> 02:19.067
Oscar framed you.

02:19.100 --> 02:21.600
We'll prove it--
I'll prove it.

02:21.667 --> 02:25.167
Thank you,
for trusting me.

02:25.233 --> 02:28.700
And for taking
care of...

02:28.767 --> 02:31.433
what I asked you
to take care of.

02:31.500 --> 02:35.067
I would do anything
for you, Sloane Hayes.

02:37.067 --> 02:38.767
Oscar's too good.

02:38.833 --> 02:41.133
We'll never be able
to prove he set me up.

02:41.200 --> 02:42.933
If I'm gonna
get out of this,

02:43.067 --> 02:45.200
I need to find who
really killed Olivia.

02:45.267 --> 02:46.667
How?

02:46.733 --> 02:48.333
I mean, the police haven't
even been able to do that.

02:48.400 --> 02:49.667
I don't know.

02:49.733 --> 02:51.933
I do know I can't
do it from a cell.

02:52.067 --> 02:53.867
Did you find out
about bail?

02:53.933 --> 02:58.200
You've been granted it,
but it's not cheap.

02:58.267 --> 03:00.167
2.5 million.

03:00.233 --> 03:01.267
Jesus.

03:01.333 --> 03:03.100
I'm on it.

03:09.233 --> 03:10.867
I was up all night
thinking.

03:10.933 --> 03:12.367
Me too.

03:12.433 --> 03:16.667
I realize the key to buying
the team is Derek.

03:16.733 --> 03:17.833
The league has
him on a pedestal.

03:17.900 --> 03:19.600
We need him on
our side.

03:19.667 --> 03:21.367
I was up all night
because I was just told

03:21.433 --> 03:24.067
I'm going to be
a father.

03:24.100 --> 03:27.067
That didn't
enter your mind?

03:27.100 --> 03:29.067
Of course it did.

03:29.133 --> 03:32.433
That's what led me
to Derek.

03:32.500 --> 03:35.200
How do you think the league
is going to look at this?

03:35.267 --> 03:36.567
This baby affects
nothing.

03:36.633 --> 03:40.200
This baby
affects everything.

03:40.267 --> 03:41.667
A baller with a baby mama.

03:41.733 --> 03:44.400
We're stereotypes now,
jokes.

03:44.467 --> 03:45.833
This baby couldn't have come

03:45.900 --> 03:47.233
at a more
inconvenient time.

03:47.300 --> 03:50.867
A baby isn't an
inconvenience.

03:50.933 --> 03:52.700
This is my child.

03:52.767 --> 03:58.467
I'm focusing on what we decided
we wanted to do, together.

03:58.533 --> 03:59.467
One of us has to.

03:59.533 --> 04:00.600
Jelena.

04:00.667 --> 04:02.700
Blood test or not,

04:02.767 --> 04:05.067
that kid
isn't yours.

04:15.067 --> 04:16.267
Have you seen
my mom or Pete?

04:16.333 --> 04:18.200
No, I haven't seen
either of them.

04:25.333 --> 04:28.600
I want to fix this rift
between Terrence and Derek.

04:28.667 --> 04:31.067
There's some air that
needs to be cleared but

04:31.133 --> 04:33.300
Derek won't give him
the time of day.

04:33.367 --> 04:35.167
You seem to have
some pull with Derek.

04:35.233 --> 04:37.100
Maybe you could...

04:37.167 --> 04:39.500
give him
a little nudge?

04:39.567 --> 04:41.067
Wow.

04:41.133 --> 04:45.300
You must be desperate as hell
to be coming to me for this,

04:45.367 --> 04:47.433
considering this was
all caused by you guys

04:47.500 --> 04:51.067
selling him out
to buy the team.

04:51.133 --> 04:55.667
I'm guessing that's why you're
so interested in him right now.

04:59.467 --> 05:01.633
I'll do it.

05:01.700 --> 05:03.800
You will?
Mm-hmm.

05:03.867 --> 05:05.467
For a price.

05:08.067 --> 05:09.800
Make me Captain.

05:09.867 --> 05:12.967
Of what?

05:16.333 --> 05:19.233
You want me to give you
Captain of the Devil Girls?

05:19.300 --> 05:20.500
You're out of your mind.

05:20.567 --> 05:22.267
You're out of yours
if you think

05:22.333 --> 05:26.067
I'm going to serve you
Derek on a silver platter.

05:26.100 --> 05:28.667
I have nothing to lose.

05:28.733 --> 05:31.667
How about you?

05:31.733 --> 05:33.100
Ladies and gentlemen,

05:33.167 --> 05:35.333
please put your
hands together

05:35.400 --> 05:39.067
for your
Los Angeles Devil Girls.

05:39.133 --> 05:40.600
And it's gonna be a battle.

07:55.800 --> 08:00.500
If you can guarantee Terrence
and Derek alone time...

08:02.367 --> 08:04.567
you can have Captain.

08:06.233 --> 08:08.100
Deal.

08:23.400 --> 08:25.800
I'm gonna kill Teddy.

08:25.867 --> 08:27.267
Thanks to his leak
the whole town

08:27.333 --> 08:28.433
is talking about
this stupid movie.

08:28.500 --> 08:29.800
Oh, it's worse
than you think.

08:29.867 --> 08:31.133
Teddy's got a meeting
with Paramount

08:31.200 --> 08:33.133
and they're "very eager".

08:37.400 --> 08:38.333
We should cancel it.

08:38.400 --> 08:39.467
We can't!

08:39.533 --> 08:40.933
People would be
suspicious,

08:41.067 --> 08:44.067
and by "people" I mean
the Sopranos and Scarfaces

08:44.067 --> 08:47.067
looking for the return
on their investment.

08:47.133 --> 08:48.700
(beep)

08:50.600 --> 08:51.733
Hmm.

08:53.367 --> 08:55.067
Derek agreed.

08:55.067 --> 08:56.067
He'll talk
to Terrence?

08:56.100 --> 08:58.167
He will,
for five minutes.

08:58.233 --> 08:59.633
Five minutes,
that's it?

08:59.700 --> 09:01.933
You never said
how much time he needed.

09:02.067 --> 09:03.333
A deal's a deal,
Jelena.

09:06.367 --> 09:08.067
Congrats, Captain.

09:08.067 --> 09:09.767
You want to work with
your mother so badly,

09:09.833 --> 09:11.700
you can do it
behind bars.

09:11.767 --> 09:15.567
This just in-- she's in jail
for Olivia's murder.

09:21.833 --> 09:23.433
They have a
signed confession.

09:23.500 --> 09:24.700
And fingerprints.

09:24.767 --> 09:26.333
If we can have those
thrown out--

09:26.400 --> 09:27.667
Mom.

09:30.367 --> 09:33.567
Why didn't
you call me?

09:33.633 --> 09:34.867
I thought it was
going to be nothing,

09:34.933 --> 09:36.600
then everything
blew up so fast.

09:36.667 --> 09:40.133
Don't worry-- no one's gonna
fight harder for me than me.

09:40.200 --> 09:43.067
My lawyer brought over Olivia's
case file and I'm diving in.

09:43.133 --> 09:44.300
Diving in?

09:44.367 --> 09:46.067
I'm going to do
what the police can't--

09:46.133 --> 09:48.600
find out who really
killed Olivia.

09:48.667 --> 09:51.533
It's my only
chance to save myself.

09:51.600 --> 09:55.667
You shouldn't be punished
for something someone else did.

09:55.733 --> 09:59.567
If whoever did do it
turned themselves in

09:59.633 --> 10:01.467
would their
punishment be less?

10:01.533 --> 10:02.967
I suppose,
but it's been months.

10:03.033 --> 10:04.767
They're not coming
forward now,

10:04.833 --> 10:07.000
and I'm not waiting.

10:07.067 --> 10:08.833
I promise you
you will never spend

10:08.900 --> 10:11.467
another moment
behind bars.

10:11.533 --> 10:13.067
I promise you
the same thing.

10:16.633 --> 10:18.467
Sloane?
Are you serious?

10:18.533 --> 10:19.733
Press is getting slammed.

10:19.800 --> 10:20.800
You're going to
have to make statement.

10:20.867 --> 10:22.267
Saying what?

10:22.333 --> 10:25.233
Your call, but the Devils
have to say something

10:25.300 --> 10:27.700
and it'll sway public
opinion in a big way.

10:27.767 --> 10:32.300
It'll either help her
or bury her.

10:32.367 --> 10:33.867
What are you gonna do?

10:40.367 --> 10:41.933
Hey.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.267
I came as soon
as I heard.

10:44.333 --> 10:46.367
I don't believe it
for a second.

10:46.433 --> 10:48.400
Thank you.

10:48.467 --> 10:51.100
I wish others were as quick
to rush to my defense.

10:51.167 --> 10:52.967
Lionel?
She has something to say

10:53.033 --> 10:55.433
about everything,
except this.

10:55.500 --> 10:57.133
Is there anything
I can do to help you?

10:57.200 --> 10:58.967
Actually, yes.

10:59.033 --> 11:00.867
I left some notes
at the arena,

11:00.933 --> 11:03.300
back from when you and I
were investigating Oscar.

11:03.367 --> 11:04.200
Could you go get them?

11:04.267 --> 11:06.433
I'll go
right now.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.800
I'm sorry, Sloane.

11:14.067 --> 11:15.500
This is useless.

11:20.067 --> 11:22.267
I need to go
see Oscar.

11:22.333 --> 11:23.400
Oscar?

11:23.467 --> 11:25.600
You can't do that.
Are you crazy?

11:25.667 --> 11:27.200
I can take him.

11:27.267 --> 11:29.933
The terms of your bail are
you cannot leave the house.

11:30.067 --> 11:32.767
I'm going back to jail anyway
if I can't figure this out.

11:32.833 --> 11:34.200
Oscar may know
more than he said

11:34.267 --> 11:36.900
or more than an outsider
could pick up on.

11:36.967 --> 11:38.700
I can decode
his double-talk.

11:38.767 --> 11:42.200
Pete, I need to do this.

11:42.267 --> 11:45.133
What makes you think you could
even get close to him?

11:45.200 --> 11:47.200
Let him know
I want to see him.

11:47.267 --> 11:48.900
I bet I'll get in.

11:59.633 --> 12:01.933
Thanks for seeing me, D.

12:02.067 --> 12:03.433
I made reservations for
lunch at your favorite--

12:03.500 --> 12:04.833
Five minutes.

12:04.900 --> 12:06.133
That's all the time
you're getting.

12:10.367 --> 12:12.100
Jelena hopes that by
the end of this conversation

12:12.167 --> 12:16.533
you'll agree to be on our
side in buying the team.

12:16.600 --> 12:19.800
That's what she hopes.

12:19.867 --> 12:21.467
I'm here because...

12:23.767 --> 12:25.233
I just want
my friend back.

12:27.200 --> 12:29.800
Turns out,

12:29.867 --> 12:31.467
I'm going to be a dad.

12:34.533 --> 12:36.567
And I want you to be
the baby's godfather.

12:40.800 --> 12:43.300
It's not Jelena.

12:43.367 --> 12:45.133
It's a waitress
from the restaurant.

12:50.500 --> 12:52.300
D...

12:55.700 --> 12:59.133
I know I screwed up
with you,

12:59.200 --> 13:03.900
and you may never want me to be
a part of your life ever again,

13:03.967 --> 13:06.067
and that's something
I'll have to live with.

13:09.067 --> 13:11.133
But I needed to ask.

13:36.733 --> 13:39.067
Thank you for this.

13:39.067 --> 13:41.333
For taking the time to
get to know me even though

13:41.400 --> 13:42.800
we got off
to a rough start.

13:42.867 --> 13:45.167
I'm not here to
get to know you.

13:45.233 --> 13:47.067
I already
had you pegged.

13:47.100 --> 13:49.567
I'm here to
shut you down.

13:49.633 --> 13:51.200
All right,
I don't need this.

13:51.267 --> 13:53.133
I'm not trying to be
bullied by a celebrity.

13:53.200 --> 13:54.933
I am trying to
create a situation

13:55.067 --> 13:56.300
where my baby can have
his father--

13:56.367 --> 13:58.967
And if that situation
pays all your bills

13:59.067 --> 14:00.367
for the rest of
your life?

14:00.433 --> 14:01.833
I don't want anything
from Terrence.

14:01.900 --> 14:04.867
But you'll
take it, right?

14:04.933 --> 14:06.900
Because he'll offer.

14:06.967 --> 14:09.067
He's a good man.

14:09.133 --> 14:12.200
He'll throw everything
at that child, and you.

14:12.267 --> 14:14.933
And you'll be there
to catch it.

14:15.067 --> 14:17.100
Hey, look--
You look.

14:17.167 --> 14:20.333
We get a dozen
Renees every year,

14:20.400 --> 14:22.633
all aimless broads
with no futures

14:22.700 --> 14:26.100
trying to cash in
on someone else's.

14:26.167 --> 14:29.067
I not only don't believe
that baby is Terrence's,

14:29.100 --> 14:32.067
I'm going to prove it.

14:32.067 --> 14:36.067
Charge her meal
to Terrence Wall.

14:36.133 --> 14:38.300
It's the last thing she'll
ever get from him.

14:42.467 --> 14:45.067
You are nothing
like you seem on TV.

14:45.067 --> 14:49.367
Sweetheart, you have
no idea what I'm like.

14:57.100 --> 14:59.067
German.

15:10.433 --> 15:11.633
It's German, leave a message.

15:11.700 --> 15:12.667
(beep)

15:12.733 --> 15:14.267
German, I have awful news.

15:14.333 --> 15:15.733
My mom's been charged
with Olivia's murder.

15:15.800 --> 15:19.367
You can't hide from this
anymore, I'm so sorry.

15:19.433 --> 15:22.067
It'll be better for you
if you turn yourself in.

15:22.067 --> 15:24.533
Call me as soon as you
get this, I'll help you.

15:53.433 --> 15:55.400
You don't look
so good, Sloane.

15:55.467 --> 15:58.167
We both know who I have
to thank for that.

16:01.100 --> 16:03.733
How have your last
few weeks been?

16:03.800 --> 16:07.067
I'm so lacking for
entertainment in here.

16:07.100 --> 16:08.533
Well, if you're
relying on exercise

16:08.600 --> 16:10.067
and men wanting
to touch you,

16:10.133 --> 16:12.500
I imagine it's
pretty quiet for you.

16:15.167 --> 16:18.367
I'm more interested in
Olivia's last few weeks.

16:18.433 --> 16:21.900
You know more than
you've said, I'm sure of it.

16:21.967 --> 16:23.933
I don't know
what's sadder,

16:24.067 --> 16:26.067
you trying to
clear your name,

16:26.100 --> 16:28.067
or you thinking
I'd help you.

16:28.067 --> 16:29.533
You agreed to see me
for a reason,

16:29.600 --> 16:32.733
and it wasn't
the repartee.

16:32.800 --> 16:35.833
Because I wanted you
to see your new home.

16:38.700 --> 16:42.100
I told you you had
no idea what you'd done.

16:48.600 --> 16:51.300
I'll find out
who killed Olivia,

16:51.367 --> 16:55.267
and when I do,
I hope it's you,

16:55.333 --> 16:57.067
because there isn't a length
of time long enough

16:57.067 --> 16:59.433
to keep you in here.

16:59.500 --> 17:02.233
You are so concerned
with Olivia's final weeks

17:02.300 --> 17:06.433
and my dealings
with her?

17:06.500 --> 17:08.567
Maybe you should look
closer to home.

17:10.733 --> 17:13.200
Pete?

17:13.267 --> 17:15.233
Wrong one.

17:37.867 --> 17:40.933
You ready to
face your past?

17:41.067 --> 17:43.633
I don't think
this is a good time.

17:43.700 --> 17:45.767
They're tearing it down,
it's empty.

17:45.833 --> 17:47.633
It's the best time.

17:47.700 --> 17:49.400
You're strong.

17:49.467 --> 17:51.100
You can handle this.

17:57.067 --> 17:59.367
You don't think I'm strong
enough to handle this.

17:59.433 --> 18:00.567
I didn't say that.

18:00.633 --> 18:01.933
Unbelievable.

18:02.067 --> 18:03.900
Jude.

18:03.967 --> 18:05.200
Jude!

18:11.300 --> 18:12.467
You just have to stay focused,

18:12.533 --> 18:13.733
show up for the games.

18:13.800 --> 18:16.567
What the hell
did you say to Renee?

18:16.633 --> 18:18.633
I'll meet you in
the rehearsal studio.

18:23.267 --> 18:24.500
All I said was--

18:24.567 --> 18:26.367
You'd prove this
baby wasn't mine.

18:26.433 --> 18:29.100
Tests can make mistakes.

18:29.167 --> 18:30.900
You're really starting
to upset me, Jelena.

18:30.967 --> 18:34.933
It's better we know
the truth, Terrence.

18:35.067 --> 18:37.200
In case you forgot,
we're trying to buy a team,

18:37.267 --> 18:39.300
something I just
sacrificed like hell--

18:39.367 --> 18:42.067
This baby comes
before the team.

18:44.300 --> 18:46.200
Huh.

18:51.533 --> 18:54.500
Bold choice.

18:54.567 --> 18:58.733
Putting my child first
isn't a choice.

18:58.800 --> 19:02.333
I know
she'll come around.

19:02.400 --> 19:05.533
It'll be important
to her too.

19:05.600 --> 19:08.067
It's good to
see you again.

19:10.700 --> 19:13.133
If you're still looking
to buy the team,

19:13.200 --> 19:14.533
I'll back you.

19:14.600 --> 19:17.300
Whatever you
need me to do...

19:17.367 --> 19:19.067
I'll do it.

19:20.600 --> 19:22.167
What I need
is a godfather.

19:34.400 --> 19:36.367
This is the first time you've
stepped foot in this office

19:36.433 --> 19:37.733
since I moved in.

19:37.800 --> 19:39.900
Well, this must be
important then.

19:39.967 --> 19:42.333
So is this online
shopping I'm doing.

19:42.400 --> 19:44.867
You need to make a statement,
supporting Sloane.

19:44.933 --> 19:47.600
I don't need to do anything.

19:47.667 --> 19:49.300
This isn't playtime.

19:49.367 --> 19:51.667
This is Sloane's life.

19:51.733 --> 19:54.767
We both know she
didn't murder anyone.

19:54.833 --> 19:56.067
The Devils not
backing her up,

19:56.133 --> 19:58.800
you not backing her up
is killing her.

20:02.300 --> 20:04.867
I know you're mad.

20:04.933 --> 20:08.167
But the person you
should be mad at is me.

20:08.233 --> 20:12.733
I'm sorry for how I acted,
I am, especially at the end.

20:12.800 --> 20:16.333
I treated you
like you were...

20:16.400 --> 20:20.600
disposable, like you never
meant anything to me.

20:20.667 --> 20:23.500
It wasn't fair,
it wasn't right.

20:23.567 --> 20:26.533
But don't take this out
on Sloane.

20:26.600 --> 20:30.067
You're better than this.

20:45.033 --> 20:46.833
Oh, it's like Chernobyl--

20:46.900 --> 20:50.200
a bomb went off and
everything just disappeared.

20:50.267 --> 20:53.600
Chernobyl would've been
too good for this place.

20:53.667 --> 20:56.133
What were they like,
your foster parents?

20:56.200 --> 20:59.100
Leo didn't work,
just bitched all day.

20:59.167 --> 21:00.633
Carla spent all
the checks they got

21:00.700 --> 21:02.800
from the state on
scratch tickets.

21:02.867 --> 21:05.833
A dozen kids
is a lot of cherries.

21:05.900 --> 21:07.333
Where'd you all sleep?

21:07.400 --> 21:09.533
Slept right here.

21:09.600 --> 21:13.167
Sometimes I'd sleep at
the courts down the street.

21:13.233 --> 21:15.767
I could be gone for days,
they'd never notice.

21:15.833 --> 21:18.867
You said Leo and Carla
gave you the name Zero.

21:18.933 --> 21:21.067
What about Gideon?

21:21.133 --> 21:22.833
My mom.

21:22.900 --> 21:25.133
That's how I came up
with all the Bible stuff.

21:25.200 --> 21:30.133
Gideon Bibles-- saw how much
people jumped at religion and...

21:30.200 --> 21:32.833
figured I'd make it
my character.

21:32.900 --> 21:35.300
How old were you when
your mother gave you up?

21:35.367 --> 21:37.500
Five.

21:37.567 --> 21:38.633
Yeah.

21:38.700 --> 21:40.667
Still don't know
why she did it.

21:40.733 --> 21:45.167
One day she just
dropped us off.

21:45.233 --> 21:46.467
"Us"?

21:46.533 --> 21:48.267
Yeah, me and my sister.

21:48.333 --> 21:49.567
You have a sister?

21:49.633 --> 21:53.067
Had, have--
I don't know.

21:53.100 --> 21:55.067
I haven't seen her in years,
we got separated.

21:55.067 --> 21:58.067
You're--- you're telling me
about a sister, about your life,

21:58.067 --> 22:00.367
like you don't have any
feelings about any of it.

22:00.433 --> 22:02.367
I have feelings.

22:02.433 --> 22:03.933
So?

22:04.067 --> 22:06.567
So I control them
so they don't control me.

22:06.633 --> 22:07.933
They're controlling
you now.

22:08.067 --> 22:11.233
I'm not gonna
lose it, Jude.

22:11.300 --> 22:13.467
Especially not
in front of you.

22:13.533 --> 22:15.267
Especially?
Why?

22:15.333 --> 22:18.167
Because you might
not like what you see.

22:32.100 --> 22:33.467
Show me.

22:38.300 --> 22:39.167
It's Teddy again.

22:39.233 --> 22:40.967
Paramount made him
an offer.

22:41.067 --> 22:42.567
One look at the paperwork
and everyone's gonna know

22:42.633 --> 22:46.733
that it was a scam--
every one.

22:46.800 --> 22:48.967
Well, what do we do now?

22:49.067 --> 22:51.267
There's one thing we can do.
Hmm?

22:51.333 --> 22:53.200
Put together everything
we've shot

22:53.267 --> 22:55.267
and torch
the whole damn thing.

22:55.333 --> 22:58.833
Yeah, people can't buy a movie
that doesn't exist.

22:58.900 --> 23:00.467
All right,
I'll pull the plug,

23:00.533 --> 23:02.533
saying they can't
afford re-shoots,

23:02.600 --> 23:05.633
Teddy will get the leaked
footage for his reel,

23:05.700 --> 23:07.467
that's it, the end.

23:07.533 --> 23:09.833
You're acting like this
is a passion project.

23:09.900 --> 23:10.867
What do you care?

23:10.933 --> 23:12.067
We were just
scamming money.

23:12.133 --> 23:13.267
I mean,
a lot of money but--

23:13.333 --> 23:15.900
It wasn't a scam
to make money.

23:15.967 --> 23:18.467
It was a scam to
spend time with you.

23:18.533 --> 23:19.867
To what now?

23:19.933 --> 23:22.067
Look, I traded something
epic because I knew

23:22.133 --> 23:24.567
you'd have to be
a part of it.

23:24.633 --> 23:28.133
I went to Teddy because
I knew he'd go to you,

23:28.200 --> 23:32.067
and he laid the breadcrumbs
so you'd find me.

23:32.067 --> 23:33.633
Why would you do
all that?

23:33.700 --> 23:35.233
Because...

23:42.067 --> 23:47.267
Because I love you,
Kyle Hart.

23:52.433 --> 23:54.567
I...

23:54.633 --> 23:56.167
appreciate that.

23:56.233 --> 23:57.933
Now, I know you've never
said that to anyone

23:58.067 --> 24:00.633
just like you know I've
never said that to anyone.

24:04.067 --> 24:06.400
Yeah, I know.

24:06.467 --> 24:07.833
Uh...

24:07.900 --> 24:11.700
Well, the torching needs
to look like an accident.

24:11.767 --> 24:12.967
Mm-hmm.

24:13.067 --> 24:15.567
So, yeah, we gotta...

24:15.633 --> 24:18.067
Use my car

24:18.067 --> 24:20.067
and make it look like
an engine fire.

24:21.533 --> 24:23.200
Well, aren't you going
to need your car?

24:23.267 --> 24:25.433
I can't take it with me.

24:25.500 --> 24:26.967
Where you going?

24:27.067 --> 24:28.267
Well, I'm going to return
most of the money

24:28.333 --> 24:30.533
but not what
we've already spent.

24:30.600 --> 24:33.733
And people are going to be
looking for it, so...

24:33.800 --> 24:35.767
can't let you
be a part of it.

24:35.833 --> 24:37.200
I'm gonna take the heat,

24:37.267 --> 24:39.967
take off a little while
until things, uh...

24:40.067 --> 24:42.833
you know, cool down.

24:42.900 --> 24:44.433
Oh.

24:44.500 --> 24:46.400
Okay.

24:46.467 --> 24:47.933
Okay.

24:51.933 --> 24:53.633
Bye, Kyle.

25:04.867 --> 25:07.967
Oh, hey, Jelena.

25:08.067 --> 25:10.233
I heard congratulations
are in order.

25:10.300 --> 25:13.100
It looks like you won't
have time to run a team,

25:13.167 --> 25:15.067
you know, since you'll be
so busy taking care of

25:15.067 --> 25:16.667
some other woman's baby.

25:16.733 --> 25:18.867
Hey.

25:18.933 --> 25:20.200
Am I interrupting
something?

25:20.267 --> 25:24.067
No, I was just wishing
"mom" here the best.

25:24.133 --> 25:26.067
Perfect time
to give up Captain.

25:26.067 --> 25:28.367
I'm sure Ahsha will do
a bang-up job.

25:28.433 --> 25:29.567
Ahsha?

25:33.100 --> 25:34.333
J won't have time
for the day-to-day

25:34.400 --> 25:35.800
running of the dancers,

25:35.867 --> 25:37.967
we'll be running
the team.

25:38.067 --> 25:40.600
Derek's jumped ship.

25:40.667 --> 25:42.267
He's backing us now.

25:46.533 --> 25:50.533
So, we have Derek
and the arena.

25:52.200 --> 25:55.700
What do you have, Lionel?

25:55.767 --> 25:57.133
Security.

26:01.333 --> 26:04.333
Please escort Ms. Howard
and Mr. Wall out of the arena.

26:04.400 --> 26:05.833
Are you serious?
Now!

26:05.900 --> 26:07.600
You can't kick us out,
we own the building.

26:07.667 --> 26:08.700
Like any landlord,

26:08.767 --> 26:11.633
you need prior written
notice to enter.

26:11.700 --> 26:13.767
Out you go.

26:13.833 --> 26:15.367
Come on.

26:24.900 --> 26:26.567
German?

26:28.867 --> 26:30.967
Are you okay?

26:31.067 --> 26:32.467
I'm fine.

26:39.633 --> 26:41.133
I got your message.

26:41.200 --> 26:42.800
I can't really stay long.
What's going on?

26:42.867 --> 26:44.300
You tell me.

26:44.367 --> 26:46.833
I saw Oscar to ask about
Olivia and he pointed me

26:46.900 --> 26:48.700
at someone else
I should talk to.

26:48.767 --> 26:51.967
Someone who had business
with her before she died...

26:52.067 --> 26:54.333
You.

26:54.400 --> 26:56.133
Ahsha.

26:56.200 --> 26:59.067
I let her do
something for me.

26:59.100 --> 27:02.067
I was wrong,
I regret it.

27:02.067 --> 27:03.667
What?

27:05.900 --> 27:09.067
Olivia was blackmailing
people before she died.

27:09.100 --> 27:12.267
Did she ever send you
a red envelope?

27:12.333 --> 27:13.600
I never got one.

27:13.667 --> 27:16.167
Ahsha, what did Olivia
have on you?

27:18.833 --> 27:19.800
Raquel, hey.

27:19.867 --> 27:20.933
Hey, is German okay?

27:21.067 --> 27:22.333
Why do you ask?

27:22.400 --> 27:25.067
I just saw him and he
looked really weird.

27:25.133 --> 27:26.167
Where are you?

27:26.233 --> 27:27.200
The arena.

27:27.267 --> 27:28.333
I have to go.

27:28.400 --> 27:30.067
I'm not done.
Mom.

27:30.133 --> 27:31.900
Ahsha, do you know more
about Olivia's death

27:31.967 --> 27:33.467
than you're letting on?

27:33.533 --> 27:34.533
Yes.

27:34.600 --> 27:37.500
But please,
please trust me.

27:37.567 --> 27:38.567
Trust you?

27:38.633 --> 27:39.833
I have to go.

27:54.800 --> 27:56.067
It's German, leave a message.

27:56.100 --> 27:57.367
(beep)

27:57.433 --> 27:59.233
German, I know you're
at the arena.

27:59.300 --> 28:00.933
Call me.

28:32.567 --> 28:33.900
No statement from
the Devils yet.

28:33.967 --> 28:35.267
No.

28:35.333 --> 28:36.267
Is it because the charges
against Sloane

28:36.333 --> 28:37.833
aren't worth commenting on?

28:37.900 --> 28:39.333
Or is there bad blood since
she started the forced sale

28:39.400 --> 28:43.067
to begin with?

28:43.067 --> 28:44.367
She what?

28:44.433 --> 28:47.167
That's what my source
inside the league says.

28:47.233 --> 28:49.633
What do you think of
Sloane Hayes?

28:51.900 --> 28:53.533
I hope she fries.

28:56.100 --> 28:57.467
Whoa.

28:59.733 --> 29:02.200
Jude, I'm not gonna
smash this house.

29:02.267 --> 29:03.800
Why not?

29:03.867 --> 29:05.567
Because it's stupid.

29:05.633 --> 29:07.300
It's stupid not to.

29:07.367 --> 29:09.600
The place is gonna be
demolished anyway.

29:09.667 --> 29:11.500
Why not help it out?

29:17.067 --> 29:21.267
Maybe... maybe it wasn't
as bad as you remember anyway.

29:21.333 --> 29:24.233
Maybe this was a safe place
for all those other kids.

29:24.300 --> 29:25.767
Really?

29:25.833 --> 29:29.633
Maybe we should be
thanking Leo and Carla.

29:29.700 --> 29:31.467
What's your sister's name?

29:34.333 --> 29:36.733
Laura.

29:36.800 --> 29:39.833
Maybe Laura hated
leaving this place...

29:39.900 --> 29:41.867
wherever she went.

31:06.200 --> 31:08.867
Bye Beau.

31:22.633 --> 31:23.967
9-1-1, what's your emergency?

31:24.067 --> 31:25.167
I'd like to report
a car on fire.

31:25.233 --> 31:26.200
Where's the fire?

31:26.267 --> 31:27.600
Olympic and Eagle.

31:31.867 --> 31:35.733
That lady has some balls,
throwing us out of our own home.

31:35.800 --> 31:38.200
Everything comes
with consequences.

31:38.267 --> 31:40.067
Hmm.

31:40.067 --> 31:43.500
You took a big risk
to get us the team.

31:43.567 --> 31:47.167
There isn't anything
I wouldn't do for you...

31:47.233 --> 31:48.433
do for us.

31:58.433 --> 31:59.700
Renee, what are you
doing here?

31:59.767 --> 32:03.400
Um, you invited me.

32:03.467 --> 32:05.333
He didn't.

32:05.400 --> 32:07.633
I did.

32:07.700 --> 32:08.867
To say good-bye.

32:08.933 --> 32:10.167
What are you
trying to do?

32:10.233 --> 32:11.633
I've already done it.

32:11.700 --> 32:13.267
I had her checked out.

32:13.333 --> 32:16.567
Apparently she has a cousin
who works at a medical lab,

32:16.633 --> 32:19.233
the same lab she had the
paternity test sent to.

32:19.300 --> 32:23.767
I went ahead and had
the blood sample re-tested.

32:23.833 --> 32:25.967
Do you want to
tell him or should I?

32:26.067 --> 32:27.500
You really are
a miserable--

32:27.567 --> 32:29.067
Renee.

32:32.733 --> 32:34.700
Terrence...

32:36.333 --> 32:37.767
Terrence, I'm sorry.

32:39.667 --> 32:41.233
You lied.

32:41.300 --> 32:43.433
I knew you would make
a great father,

32:43.500 --> 32:45.200
you're an
amazing man, you--

32:51.067 --> 32:52.567
Get out.

33:11.567 --> 33:13.067
He did what?

33:13.133 --> 33:15.800
That son of a bitch.

33:15.867 --> 33:18.200
Pete?
That was your lawyer.

33:18.267 --> 33:20.367
Oscar told the police
that you snuck in to see him

33:20.433 --> 33:23.667
under false pretenses.

33:23.733 --> 33:24.800
They're on their way
to bring you back.

33:24.867 --> 33:26.300
I need more time.

33:26.367 --> 33:29.067
Olivia was blackmailing anyone
she had anything on.

33:29.100 --> 33:31.800
Clearly she had
something on Ahsha.

33:31.867 --> 33:33.067
Why wouldn't Olivia
go after her?

33:33.133 --> 33:34.800
She sent everyone
a letter.

33:34.867 --> 33:36.133
Well, maybe she
didn't get it.

33:36.200 --> 33:38.200
Maybe it got lost
over at Kyle's.

33:38.267 --> 33:40.200
Olivia didn't know
she moved there yet.

33:40.267 --> 33:43.333
As far as she knew, Ahsha
was still living with--

33:46.533 --> 33:47.967
Sloane?

33:56.067 --> 34:00.167
That's why Ahsha's
been acting so strange.

34:00.233 --> 34:02.900
Sloane, what do you know?

34:02.967 --> 34:04.633
Honey, if you know something
that could help you,

34:04.700 --> 34:06.600
now is the
time to share it.

34:06.667 --> 34:08.400
I need to
make a call.

34:10.500 --> 34:11.867
Have you seen German?

34:11.933 --> 34:12.900
No, where would I?

34:16.433 --> 34:17.400
Hello.

34:17.467 --> 34:19.500
I know.

34:21.433 --> 34:23.133
I've been
trying to find him.

34:23.200 --> 34:25.067
You said it would be better
if he turned himself in.

34:25.133 --> 34:27.533
How long have you known?
Not long.

34:27.600 --> 34:29.867
It was an accident, he didn't
mean for it to happen.

34:29.933 --> 34:32.100
Is that
what he told you?

34:32.167 --> 34:33.533
Have you told anyone?

34:33.600 --> 34:35.100
I haven't because
you said to trust you.

34:36.367 --> 34:37.667
L.A.P.D., open up.

34:37.733 --> 34:39.067
Who's that?

34:39.067 --> 34:40.767
The police, they're here
to take me back.

34:40.833 --> 34:42.267
I'm on my way.

34:44.700 --> 34:45.967
Ahsha.

34:46.067 --> 34:47.533
We need to get to
the police station.

34:47.600 --> 34:48.933
What for?

34:49.067 --> 34:51.133
To do the hardest
thing I've ever done.

35:00.867 --> 35:01.833
Kyle, what are you
doing here?

35:01.900 --> 35:02.900
I couldn't
let you leave,

35:02.967 --> 35:04.800
not without...

35:04.867 --> 35:06.533
Not without what?

35:06.600 --> 35:08.800
Uh...

35:14.800 --> 35:17.300
I love you too.

35:18.567 --> 35:19.700
You son of a bitch.

35:38.600 --> 35:40.267
I'm sorry.

35:41.767 --> 35:45.800
I, I know
you're hurting.

35:45.867 --> 35:51.667
But I knew letting this happen
would have hurt you more.

35:51.733 --> 35:55.767
You did what
had to be done.

35:55.833 --> 36:00.900
But I'm not dumb enough to think
you're not happy about it.

36:00.967 --> 36:02.767
The went you
went after her,

36:02.833 --> 36:05.200
the ferocity...

36:05.267 --> 36:08.733
that was something else,
even for you.

36:08.800 --> 36:10.233
I knew she was lying.

36:10.300 --> 36:12.333
It wasn't about a lie.

36:12.400 --> 36:14.133
It wasn't about
buying the team,

36:14.200 --> 36:17.700
it wasn't about what
the league would think of me.

36:17.767 --> 36:19.333
It was about having
a baby.

36:24.067 --> 36:27.067
We never talked
about kids.

36:27.100 --> 36:32.167
I assumed, overhearing
you talk to Vance,

36:32.233 --> 36:35.567
that you wanted them.

36:35.633 --> 36:38.300
That was a fantasy.

36:39.300 --> 36:42.067
The reality is
they terrify you.

36:43.267 --> 36:47.433
Being a mother
terrifies you.

36:51.233 --> 36:55.067
I see now how much
I do want kids...

36:55.100 --> 36:57.567
how much I need them...

37:01.933 --> 37:03.600
...with you.

37:07.867 --> 37:11.400
I'm sorry, Terrence,
I just, I don't know.

37:12.933 --> 37:14.800
I need you to know.

37:16.400 --> 37:21.600
Your childhood was a nightmare,
I understand that,

37:21.667 --> 37:24.067
and I feel for you.

37:24.133 --> 37:28.700
But if you are ever
gonna know,

37:28.767 --> 37:30.967
you need to face it.

37:31.067 --> 37:32.533
I already faced
my mother.

37:32.600 --> 37:35.800
I'm not talking
about your mother.

37:35.867 --> 37:37.467
I'm talking about
your father.

37:52.433 --> 37:54.967
So you got to
the hotel in time?

37:55.067 --> 37:57.633
I did.

37:57.700 --> 37:59.267
And?

37:59.333 --> 38:01.667
And... he had to go.

38:01.733 --> 38:03.700
Life and limb
and all that.

38:03.767 --> 38:08.433
But, I sent him off
with something epic.

38:08.500 --> 38:12.167
Something I never
gave anyone.

38:12.233 --> 38:15.767
And a wife.

38:15.833 --> 38:17.867
Let's celebrate being
drunk in a minute.

38:20.167 --> 38:22.467
I'll uncork this sucker,
you order some Thai.

38:36.600 --> 38:38.800
What's wrong?

38:38.867 --> 38:40.267
I don't know.

38:41.967 --> 38:43.067
Raquel!

39:00.067 --> 39:01.833
Ahsha, Ahsha, wait up.

39:22.367 --> 39:23.700
Ahsha.

39:25.900 --> 39:28.167
German?

39:35.967 --> 39:39.067
I just heard the messages
you left for me,

39:39.133 --> 39:40.833
about your mom.

39:45.800 --> 39:50.467
Sloane Hayes
didn't kill Olivia.

39:50.533 --> 39:52.433
I did.

39:58.467 --> 40:00.733
Next time on "Hit The Floor"...

40:00.800 --> 40:02.300
What did Olivia
have over you?

40:02.367 --> 40:04.133
This is the last time
I'm asking.

40:04.200 --> 40:06.500
Before I sentence,
do you have anything to say

40:06.567 --> 40:08.433
on your own behalf?

40:08.500 --> 40:09.833
So this was
Olivia's fault.

40:09.900 --> 40:12.300
She was the same instigator
she always was.

40:12.367 --> 40:14.500
You're the same
crackhead you always were.

40:14.567 --> 40:15.900
This is between
you and him.

40:15.967 --> 40:17.433
If you have
a question, Jelena--

40:17.500 --> 40:18.867
I have a lot of
questions.

40:18.933 --> 40:20.467
The waitress
just disappeared.

40:20.533 --> 40:22.567
How can a man
beat his wife?

40:23.300 --> 40:24.500
Support you?

40:24.567 --> 40:26.933
You're lucky I don't
flatten you.
