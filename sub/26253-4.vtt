We could recover information quickly
if we brought it to the Dora Milaje.

Because we do not know
who has been compromised.

We spent so much time
playing there as kids.

13:34.260 --> 13:36.840
We used to know
every inch of this place.

13:41.840 --> 13:44.100
This is magnificent.

13:50.140 --> 13:52.259
[SHURI]
The tree house!

13:52.260 --> 13:54.799
We used to spend hours
playing here.

13:54.962 --> 13:58.010
It is bigger than I remember.

14:00.050 --> 14:01.280
What?

14:01.281 --> 14:02.509
Nothing.

14:02.510 --> 14:04.389
Something.

14:04.390 --> 14:06.139
It is...

14:06.140 --> 14:09.299
We three have not
been together in...

14:09.300 --> 14:11.679
Never mind. Let us
just get on with this.

14:11.680 --> 14:14.889
- Fine.
- Fine.

14:14.890 --> 14:18.469
I needed somewhere to hide the
hard drive with N'Jadaka's list.

14:18.470 --> 14:19.655
This seemed safe.

14:19.656 --> 14:20.839
Safe?

14:20.840 --> 14:23.969
We nearly died every time
we played in the branches.

14:23.970 --> 14:26.429
The thin ones
were sturdy and strong.

14:26.430 --> 14:29.009
The thick ones were hollow
and fell apart under us.

14:29.010 --> 14:31.969
[LAUGHS]
Forget the branches.

14:31.970 --> 14:35.599
What about the time you two put
together that awful homemade zip line?

14:35.600 --> 14:37.139
Hey, it wasn't awful.

14:37.140 --> 14:39.429
True.
The design was sound.

14:39.430 --> 14:43.049
The zip line would have worked if
Father and Mother had not caught us.

14:43.050 --> 14:45.049
[LAUGHTER]

14:45.050 --> 14:47.009
Exactly.

14:47.010 --> 14:49.049
Good times here.

14:49.552 --> 14:51.679
Not so many since.

14:51.680 --> 14:54.139
You could have asked us
for help, Hunter.

14:54.140 --> 14:55.370
Anytime.

14:55.371 --> 14:56.899
You could have come home.

14:56.900 --> 14:59.349
[M'BAKU LAUGHING]
Home?

14:59.350 --> 15:01.399
This isn't his home.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.479
Not yours either.

15:03.480 --> 15:06.189
This land is for the strong.

15:06.190 --> 15:09.599
You weaklings don't deserve
to breathe the air.

15:09.600 --> 15:12.399
It was a mistake
to follow us here, M'Baku.

15:12.600 --> 15:14.389
You should have run away.

15:14.390 --> 15:17.469
Really! Didn't the Shadow
Council teach you to count?

15:17.470 --> 15:19.889
"Count"? Count what?

15:19.890 --> 15:23.799
[WHITE WOLF] You're outnumbered,
you idiot, and outmatched.

15:23.800 --> 15:28.219
Outnumbered, yes.
Outmatched?

15:28.220 --> 15:29.759
[GRUNTS]

15:29.760 --> 15:32.259
M'Baku is never outmatched!

[ROARS]

15:33.600 --> 15:35.099
[BOTH EXCLAIM]

15:35.100 --> 15:38.339
A force enhancer? Is that
meant to frighten us?

15:38.340 --> 15:40.969
It is meant to destroy you!

15:50.550 --> 15:52.299
[SHURI] It's like trying
to fight the Hulk.

15:52.300 --> 15:55.259
[BLACK PANTHER] Good, because I
have fought the Hulk, and won.

15:55.260 --> 15:56.889
[WHITE WOLF]
You beat the Hulk?

15:56.890 --> 15:58.340
Split decision.

16:45.550 --> 16:48.300
Yeah? Well, think faster,

16:49.300 --> 16:50.969
I am aware.

16:50.970 --> 16:52.759

Now move!

For all of you!

16:59.600 --> 17:01.139
[LAUGHTER]

17:01.140 --> 17:03.139
I thought you were
a great warrior.

17:03.140 --> 17:05.138
You are so clumsy.
[LAUGHS]

17:05.140 --> 17:07.219
All you do is boast
like a child.

17:07.220 --> 17:09.259
Do not laugh at me!

17:09.260 --> 17:12.839
But, M'Baku,
you really are so funny.

17:12.839 --> 17:16.339
He's not a fighter, he's a clown!

I just saved your life.

18:10.161 --> 18:11.679
And did I ask you to?

18:11.680 --> 18:14.639
For once, can you stop
being the big, perfect hero?

18:14.640 --> 18:18.339
I didn't like it when we were
kids, and I truly hate it now.

18:18.340 --> 18:20.339
You have to stop this, Hunter.

18:20.340 --> 18:23.179
If you don't let go of the past,
you won't have a future with us.

18:23.180 --> 18:25.259
We can discuss this later.

Come here! Cowards!

No, [LAUGHS] thank you.

Every Shadow Council agent

"Interesting"?
That's all you have to say?

20:53.930 --> 20:57.679
I say the palace

From now on, treat it as such.
