Hmm. [sighs]

00:57.223 --> 00:58.308
[exclaims in surprise]

00:58.391 --> 01:02.020
Maurice, I found something
I need right now!

01:02.103 --> 01:03.980
I'm probably afraid to ask-- [grunts]

01:04.064 --> 01:05.648
[exclaims excitedly]

01:05.732 --> 01:09.194
"Mildred Von Hootenpuff's
Complete Book of Manners.

01:09.277 --> 01:11.321
Host the most perfect dinner party."

01:11.404 --> 01:12.238
Perfect.

01:12.322 --> 01:14.616
"Be the belle of your debutante ball."

01:14.699 --> 01:16.076
Ooh, how do you do?

01:16.159 --> 01:18.870
"Glide through life
with elegance and poise.

01:18.953 --> 01:21.414
This book has all the answers."

01:21.498 --> 01:22.499
[exclaims in delight]

01:22.582 --> 01:25.710
All the answers. [sighs]

01:25.794 --> 01:30.131
Um... It seems like just a dusty old book
of outdated etiquette, Your Majesty.

01:30.215 --> 01:34.385
I want all the answers, Mo-Mo.
[screams] And I want them now! Now!

01:34.469 --> 01:37.347
I will not rest until you have that book,
King Julien.

01:37.847 --> 01:40.391
I don't know.
That magazine looks pretty old.

01:40.475 --> 01:42.477
The company's gotta be
out of business by now.

01:42.560 --> 01:45.730
Maurice, he wants to help.
It's not your place

01:45.814 --> 01:48.691
to step on this little weasel's attempts
to suck up to me.

01:48.775 --> 01:52.946
Yeah, Maurice. Not your place.
What I do, I do for the feet.

01:53.029 --> 01:58.576
Oh, the feet. Oh, the feet!
[laughs gleefully]

01:58.660 --> 02:02.956
Yes, Mort, we know, we know,
you're a freak. Now get me that book!

02:03.039 --> 02:07.794
Whee! For my king!

02:08.878 --> 02:09.921
So I said to him,

02:10.004 --> 02:13.800
"Why didn't you tell me that before
I dislocated your shoulder?" [chuckles]

02:13.883 --> 02:16.386
And he said... You're gonna love this bit,
you're gonna love it.

02:16.469 --> 02:19.347
"I tried, but you were standing
on my neck."

02:19.430 --> 02:21.683
[laughs hysterically]

02:21.766 --> 02:24.894
It's so-- It's so... It's so good!

02:27.730 --> 02:31.317

02:32.610 --> 02:34.445
[grunts] I have returned.

-Aha! You guys, it worked!
-[Mort groans]

02:46.166 --> 02:50.211
I hold in my delicate paws
the book with all the answers.

02:50.295 --> 02:54.299
The book that will make me
the finest, proper-est, elegantile

02:54.382 --> 02:56.634
gentlelemur in all the realm!

02:56.885 --> 02:59.846
[Mort] Ha-ha, Maurice, in your face.

03:00.597 --> 03:03.016
"Chapter 3.

there were so many rules?

03:12.775 --> 03:15.486
[grunts] Oh, baby,
look at all these rules.

03:15.570 --> 03:17.780
I love rules! [laughs excitedly]

03:17.864 --> 03:23.286
Your Majesty, I would be so honored to
enforce such specific and pointless rules.

03:24.370 --> 03:27.624
Hello, destiny, what took you so long?

03:27.707 --> 03:29.167
[Julien vocalizing]

03:29.250 --> 03:34.130
Oh, look. Look. The debutante ball.
What a party!

03:34.213 --> 03:37.592
It says here I could be
the center of attention,

03:37.675 --> 03:42.513
as all the eligible bachelors
vie for my gloved hand. [laughs]

03:42.597 --> 03:43.723
Just think of that.

03:43.806 --> 03:45.350
[straining] Ow!

03:46.309 --> 03:48.478
I will have the season's best party.

03:48.561 --> 03:50.313
And we will use this book to make sure

03:50.396 --> 03:53.524
all of my peoples
are on top of their classy game.

will ruin your dinner party."

Okay, peoples, let's not ruin
this dinner party, okay?

04:04.994 --> 04:06.371
Follow the king's lead.

-And one, and two, and one, and two.

[Clover] I've done it
according to the book, Your Majesty.

04:42.323 --> 04:46.744
This dance party is officially,
as you often say, "off the heezy."

04:46.828 --> 04:50.039
That can't be right.
I guess if that's what the book says...

04:50.123 --> 04:52.333
But this isn't off the heezy at all.

04:52.417 --> 04:55.461
In fact, it is squarely upon the heezy.

04:55.545 --> 04:58.965
Like it never wants to leave
the comfort of the heezy.

Oh, boy.

05:27.577 --> 05:30.204
Wow, classing up these slobs
with some manners

05:30.288 --> 05:32.373
is a lot harder
than I thought it would be.

05:32.457 --> 05:34.417
This book makes it sound so easy.

05:34.500 --> 05:35.543
[sighs in exasperation]

05:36.085 --> 05:37.795
We could maybe bring in an expert?

Ooh! I don't believe it.

05:40.131 --> 05:41.674
Can I... Can I see it?

A first-edition Von Hootenpuff?

Oh, I never thought I'd see one in person!

05:53.519 --> 05:56.230
The king would like your help
throwing a debutante ball.

05:56.314 --> 05:58.983
What this commoner, no offense, Maurice,

05:59.067 --> 06:04.238
is trying to say is, I need your help
with my debutante ball. What do you say?

06:04.322 --> 06:05.698
[laughing excitedly]

06:05.782 --> 06:08.701
Gregor, fetch my lucky fez!

06:11.370 --> 06:12.830
Now, right curtsy.

06:12.914 --> 06:14.082

Oh. Very nice. Now, left curtsy.

to please stop yelling?

06:25.134 --> 06:27.595
[yells] Sorry, sir. [clears throat]
[whispers] Sorry, sir.

06:27.678 --> 06:31.224
I'm just massively excited about
all these new rules I get to enforce.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.184
Hmm.

06:33.267 --> 06:36.104
I can use someone like you
to help keep everyone in line.

06:36.187 --> 06:38.564
You would make an excellent protégé.

06:38.648 --> 06:41.275
Take my tiny hand and let me lead you.

06:41.359 --> 06:44.070
Thank you, sir.
I'll try not to let you down, sir.

[chuckles]

06:46.030 --> 06:48.199
Moving on to proper bowing techniques.

06:48.282 --> 06:51.786
We will be covering both
Occidental and Asian styles.

06:51.869 --> 06:53.287
[chuckling] Ooh!

06:53.371 --> 06:55.414
"Both." You were right.

The Crocodile Ambassador is really
whipping these doofuses into shape.

Hoo-ah! Wow, you have really soft paws.

[both] Oh, thank you.

07:13.349 --> 07:15.351
Hector, you're up next, hon.

07:16.352 --> 07:17.979
Nope. We're not doing this.

07:18.062 --> 07:19.272
Where's he going?

07:19.355 --> 07:23.776
At his age, I assume he's off to complain
about something that confuses him.

07:24.152 --> 07:26.946
Dang ding-dongs and their stupid manners,

07:27.029 --> 07:27.864

We have come to join
your rebellion, Wise Leader.

07:42.003 --> 07:43.337
[grunts] Mm-hmm.

07:43.421 --> 07:45.798
What the heck are you going on about?

07:45.882 --> 07:50.219
King Julien brought in that
fancy-pants gator to teach us how to act.

07:50.303 --> 07:53.264
But we already knows how to act good.

07:53.347 --> 07:55.141
[gargles, spits]

07:55.224 --> 07:56.350
[grimacing, shrieks]

07:56.434 --> 07:58.853
You don't sneak up on somebody like that!

07:59.145 --> 08:03.191
Look, I don't know who you think I am,
but I ain't wise and I'm not a leader.

08:04.358 --> 08:07.820
That's the sort of wise thing
a leader would say right there.

08:07.904 --> 08:10.490
We're not doing this. Now leave me alone.

08:10.573 --> 08:12.158
[all] We're not doing this.

08:12.241 --> 08:14.827
Stop it. I just want to be left alone.

08:14.911 --> 08:19.373
We all just want to be left alone.
We all just want to be left alone.

08:22.793 --> 08:25.129
You think they're ready
for this jelly, Mo-Mo?

08:25.213 --> 08:27.465
I can't wait be the belle of the ball!

08:27.548 --> 08:29.967
The Ambassador has spent weeks
preparing the kingdom.

08:30.051 --> 08:33.429
He says this debutante ball
will be the social event of the season.

08:33.513 --> 08:36.557
Oh, yeah! It's time to party!

08:36.641 --> 08:38.809
[beatboxing]

08:38.893 --> 08:42.188

08:42.271 --> 08:43.231
[Julien] Eh?

08:44.148 --> 08:49.820
DJ Glitterbunz, and this is a pleasant,
relaxing invasion.

08:49.904 --> 08:51.739
You snitches.

[singing]

08:55.034 --> 08:57.036
[flies buzzing]

08:59.539 --> 09:00.456
Hmm?

09:01.165 --> 09:04.502
[all chattering]

09:04.585 --> 09:06.462
Doesn't he look exquisite?

09:06.546 --> 09:10.466
A paragon of class and grace. Hoo-ah.

09:11.050 --> 09:14.971
-What?
-Welcome. Isn't this a magnificent ball?

09:15.054 --> 09:18.516
It took some doing,
but I've civilized this place.

09:18.599 --> 09:21.852
You now have the most
well-mannered kingdom on the island.

09:21.936 --> 09:25.189
I don't know if you've noticed,
but nobody's droppin' booty to the floor!

09:25.273 --> 09:28.568
And this music is weak sauce!
What did you do to them?

09:28.651 --> 09:31.779
I introduced them
to The Way of Von Hootenpuff.

09:31.862 --> 09:34.615
But if you'd like to go back
to your old heathen customs,

09:34.699 --> 09:36.325
simply tell me to leave.

09:36.409 --> 09:37.243
Fine.

09:37.326 --> 09:39.245
-[yells] Clover!
-You beckoned me?

09:39.328 --> 09:40.913
[chuckling]

09:40.997 --> 09:41.998
[screams]

09:42.498 --> 09:44.959
Clover, get this poseur outta here!

09:45.042 --> 09:46.794
Oh, no, I would never.

09:46.877 --> 09:50.840
I do hope we can all remain
cordial and polite, King Julien.

09:50.923 --> 09:56.596
[Crocodile Ambassador] Oh, well said,
[laughs] Miss Clover. Well said, indeed.

09:57.805 --> 09:59.765
[organ music playing]

10:03.644 --> 10:04.895
[sniffles]

10:05.605 --> 10:06.939
And Mildred sayeth,

10:07.023 --> 10:12.653
"It is considered improper
to wear white slacks after Labor Day.

10:12.737 --> 10:17.116
Breaking wind in mixed company
is a grave breach of etiquette."

10:18.451 --> 10:19.660
Can I get a witness?

10:19.744 --> 10:20.703
[lemurs cheering, chattering]

10:20.786 --> 10:25.750
Oh! Thank you, Mildred! [kisses] Oh! Yeah!

10:25.833 --> 10:29.503
However did we get by
without all these rules?

10:29.587 --> 10:31.672
We were in the Dark Ages!

10:31.756 --> 10:35.926
Yes, who knew I had
so much to feel shame about?

10:36.010 --> 10:40.514
This whole village
has gone cuckoo bird clocks!

10:40.598 --> 10:41.974
Something here stinks.

10:42.058 --> 10:43.142
[Mort] Oh, is it me?

10:43.225 --> 10:48.230
I rolled around in an onion patch earlier
to protect against werewolves. Yeah.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.483
[groans, exclaims in fear]

10:53.027 --> 10:55.696
We should probably talk somewhere else.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.743
All these rules. Aah!

11:01.077 --> 11:04.872
I feel like I'm in a straitjacket.
And it's so itchy! [exclaims in annoyance]

11:04.955 --> 11:07.541
[Crocodile Ambassador]
Rules are important, King Julien.

11:07.625 --> 11:08.876
[stammering] What-in-who-the-what-now?

11:08.959 --> 11:10.628
Rules keep us safe.

11:10.711 --> 11:14.340
Rules keep us from having to
answer the big questions all on our own.

11:14.423 --> 11:18.511
Oh, you don't mind if I come in and visit
for a spell, Your Majesty? Do you?

11:18.594 --> 11:19.804
[growling]

11:21.722 --> 11:23.891
-[exclaims in delight]
-[sighs]

11:23.974 --> 11:27.520
A token of my affection,
as is customary when visiting

11:27.603 --> 11:31.065
a friend or acquaintance's home,
per The Von Hootenpuff Way.

11:31.732 --> 11:33.776
Ooh. Chocolates.

11:36.445 --> 11:38.447
[straining]

11:38.531 --> 11:39.949
[sniffs, clears throat]

11:40.032 --> 11:43.786
King Julien, thank you for being
such a gracious host.

11:43.869 --> 11:45.287
[munching]

11:45.371 --> 11:48.332
I noticed you have not been attending
our town hall get-togethers.

11:48.416 --> 11:51.377
Yeah, well, uh, we've been busy,
getting together--

11:51.460 --> 11:56.132
The polite thing to do would be
to send a handwritten RSVP.

11:57.967 --> 11:58.801
Okay, buddy.

11:59.427 --> 12:00.511
Is that sea salt?

12:00.886 --> 12:03.973
I think we've had about enough
of your rules and your meddling.

12:04.056 --> 12:07.810
My peoples are dying to party down,
get crunk like they used to.

12:07.893 --> 12:11.063
I've shown your kingdom that
life is about more than feeling good

12:11.147 --> 12:14.150
and having fun with your friends.
It is about-- Ow!

12:14.233 --> 12:17.736
...discipline, sacrifice
and chewing with your mouth closed.

12:17.820 --> 12:19.029
[continues munching]

12:19.113 --> 12:21.073
But don't take my word for it.

12:22.158 --> 12:23.117
[both] Huh?

12:23.200 --> 12:26.912
The entire kingdom
is on its best behavior, Master.

12:26.996 --> 12:29.498
-Finally, we have order.
-[shrieks]

12:29.582 --> 12:34.003
Never fear, King Julien. I am willing to
give you a special, one-on-one training.

12:34.086 --> 12:37.006
And I've never met anyone
I can't help to see the light.

12:37.089 --> 12:37.923
Clover?

12:39.049 --> 12:40.301
[exclaiming in fear]

12:44.597 --> 12:47.183
Save yourself, Your Majesty! Run!

12:47.266 --> 12:48.851
-[screams]
-[growls]

12:48.934 --> 12:51.979
[screaming]

12:53.355 --> 12:54.190
[groans]

12:56.150 --> 12:59.570
Oh, I do hope you weren't
grievously injured in that collision.

12:59.653 --> 13:03.199
Please come with us
so that we may tend to your injuries.

13:03.282 --> 13:05.117
I'll brew some sun tea.

13:05.201 --> 13:06.827
[gasps] Sun tea?

13:07.661 --> 13:10.414
Oh, look! Someone's eating an entree
with a salad fork!

13:10.498 --> 13:11.540
[all gasp]

13:11.624 --> 13:13.334
[screeching]

13:13.417 --> 13:15.211
[squealing]

13:15.669 --> 13:17.171
[panting]

13:17.254 --> 13:20.633
Everybody's gone loco, Mort.
I never thought I'd say this,

13:20.716 --> 13:23.969
but somehow,
you're not the village weirdo any more.

13:24.053 --> 13:28.265
Had to pass the torch some time,
I suppose. Care to take a load off?

13:29.767 --> 13:32.853
Since when does Mort know
where the bread plate goes?

13:32.937 --> 13:37.566
I just whipped up
the most whimsical cucumber sandwiches.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.276
Aah! He's gotten to you too!

13:39.360 --> 13:40.611
[screams]

13:41.612 --> 13:42.821
Mmm.

13:42.905 --> 13:44.657
That's actually... Nope!

13:44.740 --> 13:46.742
[screaming]

13:46.825 --> 13:49.745
How many more times
do I have to tell you birdbrains?

13:49.828 --> 13:53.374
You gotta stop listening to me
and start listening to yourselves.

13:53.457 --> 13:57.461
Listen up, people.
He's commanding us to listen to ourselves!

13:57.836 --> 14:01.757
Hector, buddy. Oh, thank Frank.
You gotta help me, man.

14:01.840 --> 14:03.300
Nope, not doing this.

14:03.384 --> 14:04.927
Nope. Not doing this.

14:05.010 --> 14:07.888
[groans] All right.
What do you need, King Julien?

14:07.972 --> 14:11.016
That fancy-pants alligator fella
hijacked my kingdom

14:11.100 --> 14:15.604
and made it a cesspool of good manners,
thoughtfulness, and responsible actions.

14:15.688 --> 14:19.817
Well, if there's one thing I hate...
Well, I hate a lot of things.

14:19.900 --> 14:23.904
But one of them is when some busybody
tries to tell me what to do.

14:23.988 --> 14:25.239
Me too!

14:25.322 --> 14:27.449
Unless it's you doin' the telling,
Wise Leader.

14:27.533 --> 14:28.367
Not doing this!

14:28.450 --> 14:31.328
[growling] I say we should
put that jerk in his place.

14:31.412 --> 14:32.830
[gasps] You'll really help me?

14:32.913 --> 14:35.374
Yeah, mostly 'cause
I'm sick of these rubes

14:35.457 --> 14:37.710
following me around
like I got all the answers.

14:37.793 --> 14:39.378
I want to be left alone again.

14:39.461 --> 14:42.298
Hey, good with me.
I'm not picky about motivations.

14:42.381 --> 14:46.635
"So, you got a plan?" he asked,
already knowing the answer is no.

14:46.719 --> 14:50.347
My plan is to exploit
the Ambassador's greatest weakness.

14:50.431 --> 14:52.600
[gasps] Is there gluten in this?

14:53.517 --> 14:56.145
But I'm allergic to gluten.
Everybody knows that.

14:56.979 --> 15:00.024
Ah, I see. We're talkin' killing the guy.

15:00.107 --> 15:01.275
Okay, I'm in.

15:01.358 --> 15:02.818
Exactly. No, wait!

15:02.902 --> 15:03.861
-Hey!
-No!

15:03.944 --> 15:08.532
No, we give him a cake that's
full of gluten during a big public event.

15:08.616 --> 15:10.492
Once the butt-fireworks begin,

15:10.576 --> 15:14.580
nobody's gonna be able to look at him
as an authority on etiquette. [laughs]

15:14.663 --> 15:16.999
And we break the voodoo
he's putting on everybody.

15:17.082 --> 15:20.628
All we're going to need
is a clever disguise.

15:20.711 --> 15:22.713
[classical music playing]

15:24.465 --> 15:27.843
There's a good little chap.
Now, do the box step,

15:27.927 --> 15:29.887
and you shall be rewarded
with an aperitif.

15:29.970 --> 15:31.931
What the heck did he do
to your brain, woman?

15:32.640 --> 15:34.266
I doubted him at first too.

15:34.350 --> 15:36.644
But the Ambassador showed me
this is a better way.

15:36.727 --> 15:38.604
-[Maurice screaming in pain]
-We don't have to behave

15:38.687 --> 15:39.688
like wild animals.

15:40.022 --> 15:41.440
[yells] We are wild animals!

15:41.523 --> 15:43.484
This guy's just misquoting
the stuff in the book

15:43.567 --> 15:44.818
to make people do what he says.

15:44.902 --> 15:48.822
Is that so wrong? Aren't our citizens
living better lives now?

15:49.406 --> 15:52.701
Think about it, Maurice.
The whole island walking in lockstep.

15:52.785 --> 15:55.287
With no more troublemakers
or creative types.

15:55.371 --> 15:58.040
No more weird haircuts
or indie folk bands.

15:58.123 --> 15:59.792
-Or one-lemur shows.
-[purring]

16:01.335 --> 16:02.503
Just order.

16:02.878 --> 16:04.421
-[classical music playing]
-[groans]

16:05.005 --> 16:08.008
You no longer need to fear
responsibility for your own actions.

16:08.092 --> 16:12.471
All is laid out for you,
as long as you do as Mildred commands.

16:12.554 --> 16:16.225
I'm sure you'll come around
in time, Maurice.

16:16.392 --> 16:17.685
[Maurice wailing]

16:20.562 --> 16:23.941
Okay, people, keep the chit-chat
to a minimum. None of us have the manners

16:24.024 --> 16:26.151
to have a real conversation
with these people.

16:26.235 --> 16:31.448
And I feel real pretty.
Not that anybody complimented me yet.

16:34.451 --> 16:35.285
[gurgles]

16:35.869 --> 16:37.037
[all exclaim in anger]

16:39.498 --> 16:40.332
[gulps]

16:40.916 --> 16:41.750
[contently] Hmm.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.419
[lemur humming]

16:43.961 --> 16:44.795
[Julien growls]

16:48.966 --> 16:49.925
[all exclaim in surprise]

16:50.009 --> 16:52.928
[in woman's voice]
Good evening, Master William.

16:53.012 --> 16:58.058
Uh... My, it sure is...
uh, weather... this evening.

16:58.142 --> 16:59.268
[kisses]

16:59.476 --> 17:00.310
[giggles]

17:00.936 --> 17:06.358
Enchanté. And who's your lovely companion?

17:06.442 --> 17:09.445
[giggles] Oh, stop, you.

17:10.195 --> 17:14.366
Horst, come greet our guests.
No wedding rings.

17:14.450 --> 17:17.828
You brought a cake? Oh, how thoughtful.

17:17.911 --> 17:19.705
It looks very...

17:19.788 --> 17:21.999
[slurping]

17:22.082 --> 17:23.333
moist.

17:23.417 --> 17:27.588
[grunts] My, my. I'd never let a suitor
handle my baked goods

17:27.671 --> 17:29.465
without a proper introduction.

17:31.216 --> 17:37.890
A lady like yourself shouldn't carry
her own cake like some sort of coal miner.

17:37.973 --> 17:39.016
Here.

17:39.099 --> 17:43.353
[both grunting, groaning]

17:43.437 --> 17:44.772
I've got it.

17:45.397 --> 17:46.899
-Oh, spunky!
-Oh!

17:48.150 --> 17:49.276
-[Horst gasps]
-[Julien gasps]

17:49.359 --> 17:53.155
How dare you impugn my dignity,
whatever that means?

17:53.238 --> 17:56.408
Madame, are you King Julien?

17:56.492 --> 18:01.455
[exclaims] Me? No!
I'm his third cousin, twice removed

18:01.538 --> 18:03.665
on his granddaddy's butler's side.

18:04.583 --> 18:06.001
And when he finds out about-- Hey!

18:07.044 --> 18:09.046
I know just what to do with this.

18:09.296 --> 18:10.756
[in normal voice] That's my cake!

18:12.341 --> 18:16.720
[in woman's voice] I mean, my cake.
A present for the Crocodile Ambassador.

18:16.804 --> 18:19.765
It's The Von Hootenpuff Way,
for crying out loud.

18:19.848 --> 18:22.309
King Julien, I presume?

18:22.601 --> 18:25.896
I am Grunt-hilda Knickerbocker
Fancypants...

18:25.979 --> 18:27.064
[in normal voice] Yeah, it's me.

18:27.272 --> 18:31.902
King Julien, you have terrorized
this island with your bad behavior.

18:31.985 --> 18:36.490
And now, you will answer for it.
There will be a public inquisition.

18:37.449 --> 18:39.701
Uh, that's probably bad, right?

18:42.246 --> 18:43.163
[straining]

18:43.247 --> 18:48.627
Your once-great king stands trial
for a number of grievous faux pas.

18:48.710 --> 18:50.712
How do you plead, Mister Julien?

18:50.796 --> 18:54.466
Usually like, "Oh, please! Let me go!"

18:54.550 --> 18:58.137
Then I'd get on my knees
and then I really beg. You know. [laughs]

18:58.220 --> 18:59.680
The king's still got it, right, gang?

18:59.763 --> 19:02.558
I find myself wanting
to laugh at his jape,

19:02.641 --> 19:04.434
but feeling too ashamed to do so.

19:04.518 --> 19:09.940
That's great, hon. Stuff it all down.
Madam Von Hootenpuff would be proud.

19:10.566 --> 19:14.862
Now, what are these supposed flopahs
I'm accused of, by the way?

19:14.945 --> 19:16.697
One each of the following.

19:18.949 --> 19:21.952
Failure to say "Gesundheit"
after a sneeze.

19:22.035 --> 19:24.788
Improper hand positioning
during a foxtrot.

19:24.872 --> 19:26.790
High-fiving a member of the clergy.

19:26.874 --> 19:31.211
Failure to salute a royal baby.
Eating while on the toilet.

19:31.295 --> 19:34.339
Pretending the Five-Second Rule
is a real thing.

19:35.048 --> 19:39.136
I object. Sustained.
Your Honor, this is a kangaroo court.

19:39.219 --> 19:42.931
And not a real one with real kangaroos,
'cause that would be awesome.

19:43.015 --> 19:46.018
[chuckling] I mean, real kangaroos.
In a court.

19:46.101 --> 19:48.520
Please refrain from commenting
until I'm finished.

19:48.604 --> 19:50.397
You are finished!

19:50.480 --> 19:51.398
[all gasp]

19:51.481 --> 19:52.399
Hmm?

19:52.482 --> 19:56.904
What happened to us, my peoples?
When did we all get so uptight?

19:56.987 --> 20:00.824
Remember how much fun we used to have
before this guy started bossing us around?

20:00.908 --> 20:02.910
I am merely doing what the book says.

20:02.993 --> 20:05.245
That's the thing. We don't need the book.

20:05.329 --> 20:07.122
We were getting along great without it

20:07.206 --> 20:10.167
before Maurice had the bright idea
to ruin everything.

20:10.250 --> 20:11.501
[Maurice] That was your idea!

20:11.585 --> 20:12.419
Shut it!

20:12.502 --> 20:13.754
[sighs]

20:13.837 --> 20:17.132
This book was supposed to
make us nicer to each other.

20:17.216 --> 20:21.261
To be better friends and citizens.
But he's using it to divide us.

20:21.345 --> 20:22.429
[scoffing]

20:22.512 --> 20:25.933
Do we really need a list of approved fonts
for thank-you notes?

20:26.016 --> 20:30.062
Or do we just need to remember to
appreciate and care more about each other?

20:30.812 --> 20:32.981
And if this book is getting in the way,

20:33.065 --> 20:37.486
I say, let's throw it out
and go back to how things were.

20:37.569 --> 20:40.447
What do you say? Huh? Right?

20:40.530 --> 20:42.199
-[Horst slurping]
-Who's with me?

20:42.282 --> 20:43.283
Rude.

20:43.367 --> 20:48.497
Yes, he completely interrupted
the Ambassador. The nerve!

20:48.580 --> 20:49.665
[all gasping, grumbling]

20:50.290 --> 20:51.166
[laughs triumphantly]

20:51.250 --> 20:53.293
Seems as though the people have spoken.

20:53.377 --> 20:56.296
You are hereby sentenced to...

20:56.380 --> 20:58.382
[gurgling]

20:58.715 --> 20:59.967
[farts]

21:00.050 --> 21:02.010
[all gasping, murmuring]

21:02.094 --> 21:03.428
What? This only happens when--

21:03.512 --> 21:06.765
You eat gluten. Ha! [grunts]

21:06.848 --> 21:07.766
Clover?

21:07.849 --> 21:10.269
I was working as a double agent,
Your Majesty.

21:10.352 --> 21:12.729
[Maurice] Oh, come on,
you tortured me, man!

21:12.813 --> 21:14.564
It was for the good of the kingdom!

21:14.648 --> 21:15.482
Mostly.

21:16.233 --> 21:19.111
Once I understood the Ambassador's plan,
I had to stop it.

21:20.821 --> 21:22.823
I gave him the gluten-filled cake,

21:23.865 --> 21:25.742
knowing it would cause him to...

21:25.826 --> 21:27.661
[farting]

21:28.203 --> 21:29.538
Oh, did he just...

21:29.621 --> 21:32.457
He swore a gentleman never did that.

21:32.541 --> 21:35.043
Now, now. Everyone, please calm--

21:35.127 --> 21:36.628
[farting]

21:36.712 --> 21:40.048
[laughing hysterically]

21:40.132 --> 21:41.049
[both laugh]

21:41.133 --> 21:43.218
This is highly uncivilized.

21:43.302 --> 21:44.386
[farts]

21:44.469 --> 21:45.304
[bird squawks]

21:46.388 --> 21:48.265
[all laughing]

21:50.892 --> 21:52.561
You... You animals!

21:54.604 --> 21:56.189
[farting]

21:56.273 --> 21:58.150
[laughing]

21:59.985 --> 22:03.655
[cheering]

22:03.822 --> 22:05.157
Are you okay, Your Majesty?

22:05.240 --> 22:06.825
I'm better than okay.

22:07.200 --> 22:08.201
[chuckles]

22:08.285 --> 22:09.870
I have an announcement to make.

22:09.953 --> 22:14.124
From now on,
nobody has to follow any rules at all.

22:14.207 --> 22:15.292
[all cheering]

22:16.209 --> 22:21.548
[chuckles nervously] Absolutely no rules
seems like a bad idea, Your Majesty.

22:21.631 --> 22:25.010
Oh, way to bring us all down, Clover.

22:25.469 --> 22:30.849
All right, as long as you're not hurting
anybody, let your freaky flags fly.

22:30.932 --> 22:33.143
Keep Madagascar weird, y'all! Peace!

22:33.435 --> 22:36.229
[all cheering]

22:36.646 --> 22:38.732
Really? How weird?

22:38.815 --> 22:39.900
Not you, Mort.

22:41.318 --> 22:43.904
