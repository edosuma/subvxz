WEBVTT

00:08.660 --> 00:09.879
Lot of money in the pot, Dave.

00:09.922 --> 00:11.011
You thought
you could come over here

00:11.054 --> 00:13.317
and play cards with the big dog?

00:13.361 --> 00:15.972
Well, you about to get bit.

00:18.975 --> 00:21.064
Go ahead, take your best shot.

00:21.108 --> 00:22.761
Do you have any nines?

00:22.805 --> 00:25.025
Go fish.
Ha, ha!

00:27.114 --> 00:28.463
Ooh.

00:28.506 --> 00:31.118
Will you look at that?
I hooked a nine.

00:32.206 --> 00:33.903
Booyah!

00:34.947 --> 00:36.427
Uh-oh, big dog, you got smoked

00:36.471 --> 00:38.299
by a dude who says "booyah."

00:39.517 --> 00:41.215
Hey, guys.
Whatcha doing?

00:41.258 --> 00:44.044
Oh, hey, hon. I just beat
Calvin and Malcolm in Go Fish.

00:44.087 --> 00:45.306
Booyah!

00:46.742 --> 00:48.700
Malcolm, I'm glad you're here.

00:48.744 --> 00:50.789
How do you feel
about blind dates?

00:50.833 --> 00:53.096
Oh, to be honest, Gemma,
I'm not really into bl...

00:53.140 --> 00:55.142
Great!

00:55.185 --> 00:57.753
Because there's this wonderful
new English teacher at school,

00:57.796 --> 01:01.104
Sofia, and I think you two
have a lot in common.

01:01.148 --> 01:04.455
Oh, so she also lives at home
and takes the bus to work?

01:06.153 --> 01:08.198
Thank you, Gemma,
but I don't think so.

01:08.242 --> 01:10.461
My last blind date turned out
to have three children.

01:10.505 --> 01:12.072
Well, you like kids.

01:12.115 --> 01:13.725
Yeah, but she brought
all of them to dinner.

01:15.118 --> 01:18.208
And one of them
was older than me.

01:18.252 --> 01:20.471
I promise you,
you have nothing to worry about.

01:20.515 --> 01:22.821
I'm kind of known
for my matchmaking skills.

01:22.865 --> 01:25.128
I have a perfect track record.

01:25.172 --> 01:26.608
Well...

01:27.870 --> 01:29.828
What about the Parkers?

01:29.872 --> 01:32.266
Oh, so he has a secret family
in Winnipeg and that's on me?

01:33.310 --> 01:34.833
Anyway,

01:34.877 --> 01:39.099
back in Kalamazoo, they called
me Dr. Wedding Bells.

01:39.142 --> 01:40.361
Hey, look,
I appreciate it, Gemma,

01:40.404 --> 01:42.102
but I'm not that desperate yet.

01:42.145 --> 01:44.843
You're not?

01:44.887 --> 01:48.238
You're playing Go Fish
with two married men.

01:48.282 --> 01:51.111
And last night I caught you
slow-dancing with a mop.

01:52.329 --> 01:53.635
He'll take it.

01:53.678 --> 01:56.290
Okay, fine.
I guess we can go for a drink.

01:56.333 --> 01:58.292
Here you go, man.

01:58.335 --> 01:59.902
Whoa, what's this, Pop?

01:59.945 --> 02:02.557
Uh, just some extra cash
in case she brings her kids.

02:04.298 --> 02:06.213
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

02:06.256 --> 02:07.344
♪ Welcome to the hood.

02:12.262 --> 02:14.438
Calvin, I just heard
that Terrence Walker died.

02:14.482 --> 02:16.223
Can you believe that?

02:16.266 --> 02:19.226
Absolutely.
The man was on his last leg.

02:19.269 --> 02:21.141
He lost the first one in Korea.

02:23.317 --> 02:25.101
Well, apparently,
he didn't leave a will,

02:25.145 --> 02:28.060
and now his whole family
is fighting over his estate.

02:28.104 --> 02:29.845
What estate?

02:29.888 --> 02:33.675
He had an '81 Buick
and a closet full of left shoes.

02:38.549 --> 02:40.203
I don't know, Calvin.

02:40.247 --> 02:42.118
We're not as young
as we used to be.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.294
Maybe we should be thinking
about making our will.

02:44.338 --> 02:47.906
Oh, no. Baby, we're not
old enough to need a will.

02:47.950 --> 02:50.170
I just got carded last week.

02:50.213 --> 02:51.693
That's because the waiter

02:51.736 --> 02:53.912
was trying to give you
a senior discount.

02:53.956 --> 02:56.567
Which I did not qualify for.

02:57.829 --> 03:00.180
Calvin, God forbid you died.

03:00.223 --> 03:02.182
I mean, the last thing
you would want is for the boys

03:02.225 --> 03:04.140
to have to fight
over your stuff.

03:04.184 --> 03:07.839
I'm dead and you're worried
about the boys?

03:09.145 --> 03:10.886
Wow, Tina.

03:12.148 --> 03:13.193
Wow.

03:19.329 --> 03:21.070
Hey, brother,

03:21.113 --> 03:23.290
I am meeting a blind date
for a drink.

03:23.333 --> 03:25.074
and I really don't
want to be here.

03:25.117 --> 03:26.989
So can you call my cell
in, like, half an hour?

03:27.032 --> 03:30.471
Say no more. Grandma's in
the hospital or fire at home?

03:30.514 --> 03:32.255
Let's not take chances.

03:32.299 --> 03:35.476
Grandma's in the hospital
because of the fire at home.

03:37.042 --> 03:38.653
Here's my number.

03:38.696 --> 03:40.655
Hi. Malcolm?

03:40.698 --> 03:42.787
Oh, damn.

03:42.831 --> 03:44.267
Sofia?

03:46.269 --> 03:49.838
Let me guess. You were about
to have a sick aunt?

03:49.881 --> 03:51.361
What?

03:53.233 --> 03:54.234
How did you know?

03:54.277 --> 03:56.105
Because I'm getting

03:56.148 --> 03:58.499
a call from mysick aunt.

04:00.152 --> 04:01.502
Never mind, he's cute.

04:04.679 --> 04:07.072
Hey, wait.

04:07.116 --> 04:09.118
We only need a table
for the two of us, right?

04:09.161 --> 04:10.815
Yeah. Why?

04:10.859 --> 04:12.208
I'm just checking.

04:16.299 --> 04:19.694
Hey, babe. Whatcha doing?

04:19.737 --> 04:21.391
Just getting some fresh air.

04:21.435 --> 04:22.958
It's a beautiful night.

04:23.001 --> 04:24.351
The stars are out.Yeah...

04:24.394 --> 04:25.352
You're waiting for Malcolm.

04:25.395 --> 04:27.223
Where the hell is he?!

04:27.267 --> 04:28.790
Well, if they're not home yet,

04:28.833 --> 04:30.922
the date must have
gone well, right?

04:30.966 --> 04:34.186
Not just well. Sofia texted me
and said it went great.

04:34.230 --> 04:36.319
Looks like Dr. Wedding Bells

04:36.363 --> 04:39.148
hasn't lost a patient yet.

04:39.191 --> 04:40.584
Well...

04:40.628 --> 04:43.239
I don't know if the
Cahills would agree.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.806
Again, not my fault.

04:44.849 --> 04:47.243
If he didn't know he was gay,
how was I supposed to?

04:48.244 --> 04:50.333
Hey, guys.Enough with the chitchat.

04:50.377 --> 04:51.987
Tell me everything.

04:52.030 --> 04:53.771
Look, there's not much to tell.

04:53.815 --> 04:55.817
It was okay.

04:55.860 --> 04:57.209
Wha...

04:57.253 --> 04:59.299
Just okay?Oh.

04:59.342 --> 05:02.780
Time of death: 9:32.

05:02.824 --> 05:06.393
Wha... But Sofia said
it went great. What happened?

05:06.436 --> 05:08.046
All right, here's the truth.

05:08.090 --> 05:09.526
She has got this annoying laugh.

05:09.570 --> 05:11.833
A-And I mean,
it's really annoying.

05:11.876 --> 05:13.182
How bad is it?

05:13.225 --> 05:14.705
People around us
were checking their phones

05:14.749 --> 05:16.403
to see if there was
a Amber Alert.

05:17.969 --> 05:19.928
Look, I'm sorry, Gemma,

05:19.971 --> 05:21.930
but that's a deal breaker
for me, all right?

05:21.973 --> 05:23.323
Thank you for trying, though.

05:25.107 --> 05:26.674
GEMMA:
I can't believe it.

05:26.717 --> 05:30.330
I-It's crazy for something
like that to be a deal breaker.

05:30.373 --> 05:33.507
Catching your husband in a
Jacuzzi with the mailman I get.

05:35.422 --> 05:37.772
But this? No.

05:37.815 --> 05:40.949
Well, look, Gemma, everyone
has their deal breakers.

05:40.992 --> 05:43.386
You know, when I was single,
I could never date

05:43.430 --> 05:44.474
someone who littered

05:44.518 --> 05:47.695
or had the same
haircut as my mom.

05:48.913 --> 05:51.612
Or lived east of highway 43.

05:51.655 --> 05:54.789
It is bumpkin central
over there.

05:54.832 --> 05:58.096
Dave, I lived east
of highway 43.

05:58.140 --> 06:00.055
Oh, I know.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.581
But once I got to
know you better,

06:04.625 --> 06:06.583
I discovered so many
of your deal makers

06:06.627 --> 06:08.977
that I forgot about
my one deal breaker.

06:09.020 --> 06:11.545
Aw.

06:11.588 --> 06:13.373
Plus, you were the only girl
I met from over there

06:13.416 --> 06:14.722
who wasn't in a fight club.

06:17.725 --> 06:19.117
Maybe if I can
get Malcolm to see

06:19.161 --> 06:20.641
more of Sofia's good qualities,

06:20.684 --> 06:23.426
he'll get over his deal breaker,
just like you did.

06:23.470 --> 06:24.558
I guess.

06:24.601 --> 06:25.994
How long did it take you?

06:26.037 --> 06:28.910
Like, two or three dates?

06:28.953 --> 06:31.739
Yeah, let's go with that.

06:34.611 --> 06:36.744
Oh, hey, Dad.Hey, hey.

06:36.787 --> 06:39.529
Oh, y'all watching
YouTube videos again?

06:39.573 --> 06:42.489
Play the one where the monkey
steals the baby's ice cream.

06:42.532 --> 06:45.405
No, Calvin, I asked
Marty to come over

06:45.448 --> 06:46.928
and help us do our wills.

06:46.971 --> 06:48.146
MARTY:
Yeah, I found
this website

06:48.190 --> 06:49.496
that does almost
all the work for you.

06:49.539 --> 06:52.194
So basically,
all you have to do is die.

06:52.237 --> 06:54.544
Boy, I survived
black Michael Jackson,

06:54.588 --> 06:56.546
white Michael Jackson

06:56.590 --> 06:59.462
and "Damn, I ain't know he
did all that" Michael Jackson.

06:59.506 --> 07:01.551
I ain't going nowhere.

07:01.595 --> 07:04.467
Okay, fine.
I'll do it without you.

07:04.511 --> 07:05.773
So leave his truck with Dave.

07:05.816 --> 07:08.645
Over my dead body.

07:08.689 --> 07:11.256
Exactly.Exactly.

07:11.300 --> 07:12.475
Fine.

07:12.519 --> 07:14.042
Come on.
Let's do this, then.

07:14.085 --> 07:15.609
Let's-let's do it.Aw.

07:15.652 --> 07:17.785
Thank you, baby. And I promise
you, when we're done,

07:17.828 --> 07:19.134
you can watch your monkey video.

07:19.177 --> 07:20.440
How does that sound?

07:21.528 --> 07:22.833
Good.

07:24.095 --> 07:25.836
Okay, let's get started.

07:25.880 --> 07:28.317
Hmm.Uh, "Names, ages..."

07:28.360 --> 07:30.232
Oh, do you want to be
buried or cremated?

07:30.275 --> 07:31.494
Buried.Buried.

07:31.538 --> 07:32.495
Okay, great.

07:32.539 --> 07:34.018
Uh, moving on to the estate.

07:34.062 --> 07:35.585
"In the event that one of you
gets remarried..."

07:35.629 --> 07:38.632
Ha!
Next question, man.

07:38.675 --> 07:40.677
Whoa. Hold on.

07:40.721 --> 07:42.287
Why is that funny?

07:42.331 --> 07:45.465
'Cause I would never be
with another woman after you.

07:47.597 --> 07:50.470
And you definitely
couldn't be with another man.

07:52.646 --> 07:54.735
So, Calvin,
if you up and die tomorrow,

07:54.778 --> 07:57.868
you would expect me to be single
for the rest of my life?

07:57.912 --> 07:59.348
Uh, yeah.

08:00.958 --> 08:02.525
Winnie Mandela did it.

08:02.569 --> 08:05.702
Coretta Scott King did it.

08:05.746 --> 08:07.574
Tina Butler can do it, too.

08:08.618 --> 08:10.925
Mandela, Dr. King.

08:10.968 --> 08:13.231
Why don't you
just compare yourself to Jesus?

08:13.275 --> 08:14.537
Well, fine. When I die,

08:14.581 --> 08:16.626
you got three days,
and I'm coming back.

08:19.020 --> 08:20.804
Stop playing with me, Tina.

08:20.848 --> 08:23.590
I forbid you to remarry
after I die.

08:23.633 --> 08:26.549
Well, if you keep it up,
you won't have to.

08:29.421 --> 08:30.771
Hey, who wants to watch
a monkey video?

08:34.035 --> 08:35.689
So, you see, Grover,

08:35.732 --> 08:37.473
even though Charlotte
dies in the end,

08:37.517 --> 08:40.171
the sacrifices she made
for Wilbur the pig

08:40.215 --> 08:42.652
show us what true
friendship really is.

08:42.696 --> 08:45.655
All it did
was make me want bacon.

08:46.613 --> 08:49.267
Remind me to never let you read
Old Yeller.

08:51.269 --> 08:52.749
Hey, Malcolm.

08:52.793 --> 08:55.186
Oh, hey, Dave.
Uh, Gemma asked me to come over

08:55.230 --> 08:56.971
and help Grover out
with his book report.

08:57.014 --> 08:59.713
Huh.
That's usually my job.

08:59.756 --> 09:01.192
It was...

09:01.236 --> 09:03.804
until I got a C
on the last one.

09:06.154 --> 09:08.591
I don't care what
Ms. Sweeney says.

09:08.635 --> 09:12.508
Charlie did nothing to deserve
that chocolate factory.

09:18.340 --> 09:19.733
Hi, I'm...

09:19.776 --> 09:21.430
Sofia?Sofia?

09:21.473 --> 09:22.779
Sofia!

09:29.699 --> 09:32.876
So, Sofia, what languages
do you speak again?

09:32.920 --> 09:36.271
Well, English,
Spanish, French...

09:36.314 --> 09:40.667
Ooh, French. As in fries,
toast and kissing.

09:41.668 --> 09:43.974
Gemma, you're embarrassing me.

09:44.018 --> 09:46.063
Sorry.

09:46.107 --> 09:47.456
She also graduated cum laude
from Berkeley.

09:47.499 --> 09:51.329
Yeah, she mentioned that

09:51.373 --> 09:52.374
at the restaurant.

09:52.417 --> 09:54.506
You know who else
went to Berkeley?

09:54.550 --> 09:57.466
Frank M. Business.

09:57.509 --> 10:00.512
The "M" stands for Mindyourown.

10:02.427 --> 10:03.951
Um,

10:03.994 --> 10:05.605
Gemma, uh, where's the bathroom?

10:05.648 --> 10:07.868
Oh, uh, through the door
next to the stairs.

10:10.827 --> 10:12.133
Really?

10:12.176 --> 10:13.787
I can't believe y'all did this.

10:13.830 --> 10:16.485
Hey, don't look at me.
I had nothing to do with this.

10:16.528 --> 10:19.749
I've been upstairs brushing up
on Charlotte's Web.

10:19.793 --> 10:21.969
Like a sucker.

10:23.405 --> 10:25.581
It's true.
This is all on me.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.149
I just wanted you to
give Sofia another shot.

10:28.192 --> 10:29.933
Once you spend
some more time with her,

10:29.977 --> 10:31.935
you'll forget all about
her silly little laugh.

10:31.979 --> 10:33.545
Gemma, this is not cool.
I told you

10:33.589 --> 10:35.417
I'm not interested in her or
the fact that she speaks French.

10:35.460 --> 10:38.725
Bon-Bonjour!

10:38.768 --> 10:40.335
Oh!

10:42.032 --> 10:43.947
Bonjour.

10:51.476 --> 10:53.827
I'd take my mom's haircut
over that any day.

10:53.870 --> 10:55.959
Ooh.

10:57.613 --> 11:00.703
So, who gets the house--
me or Malcolm?

11:00.747 --> 11:02.270
Whichever one of you promises

11:02.313 --> 11:04.489
not to let
your new stepdaddy move in.

11:06.013 --> 11:08.145
Oh, come on, Calvin.

11:08.189 --> 11:10.452
You know, look,
if I die tomorrow,

11:10.495 --> 11:13.107
I would want you to do
what you have to to be happy.

11:13.150 --> 11:14.804
Oh, really?

11:14.848 --> 11:17.677
So you'd be okay if I married
Monique Baker?

11:17.720 --> 11:20.810
That skank ho?!

11:20.854 --> 11:24.509
Don't you talk about
Marty's stepmother like that.

11:24.553 --> 11:25.728
Wait.

11:25.772 --> 11:27.164
Wait, who is Monique Baker?

11:27.208 --> 11:30.559
She's a skank ho, that's who!

11:30.602 --> 11:32.082
She used to sing in the choir

11:32.126 --> 11:34.476
with your mother,
and I ain't gonna lie--

11:34.519 --> 11:36.347
she was pretty easy
on the eyes.

11:37.392 --> 11:39.350
What?

11:39.394 --> 11:41.439
You wouldn't want me
to be with somebody ugly now,

11:41.483 --> 11:45.095
would you? I mean, that would be
disrespecting your legacy.

11:46.531 --> 11:49.883
So you been cheating on me
in your mind all these years?

11:49.926 --> 11:52.712
Come on, Tina.
You know my mind.

11:52.755 --> 11:53.974
You know I don't think.

11:55.584 --> 11:58.282
Well, you thought her
name up pretty quick.

11:58.326 --> 11:59.849
Yeah, it was pretty quick, Dad.

11:59.893 --> 12:01.285
You just lost the house.

12:01.329 --> 12:02.983
Damn it.

12:03.026 --> 12:05.420
And I'm not understanding
why you're so upset.

12:05.463 --> 12:08.379
'Cause I was ready to mourn
for the rest of my life,

12:08.423 --> 12:11.426
but no...

12:11.469 --> 12:13.689
you want us to be happy.

12:15.256 --> 12:17.432
Okay, fine.
Maybe you're right.

12:17.475 --> 12:20.261
Maybe I shouldn't get
remarried when you're gone.

12:20.304 --> 12:22.045
See? Now,
that's what I'm talking about.

12:22.089 --> 12:24.265
I mean, why tie myself down
to one man

12:24.308 --> 12:25.832
when I can date
a whole bunch of 'em?

12:25.875 --> 12:27.311
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

12:27.355 --> 12:28.835
W-What'd you just say?

12:28.878 --> 12:30.793
Uh, maybe now's a good time
for me to get a snack.

12:30.837 --> 12:32.316
Or, you know,
leave forever.

12:32.360 --> 12:34.318
Oh.Yeah.

12:34.362 --> 12:35.885
You heard me.

12:35.929 --> 12:37.452
Maybe I should play the field,

12:37.495 --> 12:39.019
you know,
even go back to Jamaica,

12:39.062 --> 12:41.717
get my groove back.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.414
Or maybe

12:43.458 --> 12:45.416
I should date a younger guy.

12:45.460 --> 12:48.332
I hear Monique's son
is really good-looking.

12:48.376 --> 12:51.814
You stay away
from my future wife's son.

12:51.858 --> 12:53.816
Wait, uh, time-out.

12:53.860 --> 12:57.646
You do realize that means you
would be dating my stepbrother?

12:57.689 --> 12:59.648
Ooh, you are so smart.

12:59.691 --> 13:01.824
I wonder if you get it
from your late father.

13:01.868 --> 13:03.304
What's his name again?

13:05.045 --> 13:07.003
You know what,
that's it.

13:07.047 --> 13:09.092
If I die,
I'm coming back as a ghost.

13:09.136 --> 13:11.007
Let's see you keep a boyfriend

13:11.051 --> 13:13.009
when I'm poltergeisting his ass.

13:17.361 --> 13:19.320
Oh, and you know
what else?

13:19.363 --> 13:22.540
Sofia was telling me about
how much she loves to read.

13:22.584 --> 13:24.629
Malcolm's
a big reader, too.

13:24.673 --> 13:25.630
What are you reading
these days?

13:25.674 --> 13:26.936
Oh, all kinds of stuff.Mm.

13:26.980 --> 13:29.243
E-mails,

13:29.286 --> 13:31.811
text message...

13:31.854 --> 13:33.421
takeout menus.

13:38.252 --> 13:40.428
Guys, I think the cat
from the alley is back.

13:41.690 --> 13:43.561
And it sounds
like she's having babies.

13:43.605 --> 13:45.868
Uh, go back upstairs

13:45.912 --> 13:48.088
and finish your
book report, sweetie.

13:48.131 --> 13:50.307
Well, I guess
I should be getting home.

13:50.351 --> 13:52.179
Well, but it's still early.

13:52.222 --> 13:54.094
Yeah, well, when you're
a security guard, you need

13:54.137 --> 13:55.095
a lot of rest.

13:55.138 --> 13:56.400
Otherwise you might fall

13:56.444 --> 13:57.575
for a sneak attack.

13:59.142 --> 14:00.404
Oh, okay.

14:00.448 --> 14:02.319
It was nice to see you.

14:02.363 --> 14:03.973
It was nice
to see you, too.

14:04.017 --> 14:06.671
Malcolm, before you leave,
can I see you in the kitchen?

14:06.715 --> 14:08.456
I have an important...

14:08.499 --> 14:10.719
security guarding question.

14:14.810 --> 14:16.768
Sofia, uh...

14:16.812 --> 14:18.466
you're an English teacher.

14:18.509 --> 14:20.772
You tell me those Oompa Loompas
didn't deserve

14:20.816 --> 14:22.296
the chocolate factory.

14:24.080 --> 14:25.473
Malcolm, don't leave now.

14:25.516 --> 14:27.170
You're not giving her a chance.

14:27.214 --> 14:29.172
That's because I told you
I'm not interested.

14:29.216 --> 14:31.174
Just because of her laugh?

14:31.218 --> 14:33.873
Which, by the way,
I happen to think is cute.

14:41.315 --> 14:42.664
Okay, Grover's right.

14:42.707 --> 14:44.753
It's like a catfight
in her throat.

14:46.755 --> 14:48.061
But...

14:48.104 --> 14:50.672
she's so great
in every other way.

14:50.715 --> 14:52.848
She's just not for me, okay?

14:52.892 --> 14:55.633
Fine. I guess
I'm just disappointed.

14:55.677 --> 14:57.722
I didn't think
you were so superficial.

14:57.766 --> 15:00.508
No, look, Gemma, I'm not
superficial, all right?

15:00.551 --> 15:02.640
It's just...

15:02.684 --> 15:04.686
It's just what?

15:05.730 --> 15:06.906
All right, you want the truth?

15:06.949 --> 15:09.299
The problem is not her laugh.

15:09.343 --> 15:11.606
I actually like it.Really?

15:12.650 --> 15:16.437
I mean, really?

15:16.480 --> 15:18.134
Yes, okay?
It's got character.

15:18.178 --> 15:20.223
She doesn't hold back, and...

15:20.267 --> 15:22.530
I think that's cool.

15:22.573 --> 15:24.749
Okay, so then what's
the deal breaker?

15:24.793 --> 15:25.968
It's me.

15:26.012 --> 15:27.752
I'm the deal breaker.

15:27.796 --> 15:29.624
I-I got to go.

15:30.755 --> 15:32.932
Hey, it was really great
to see you.

15:32.975 --> 15:34.934
Um, good night.

15:39.764 --> 15:41.592
What just happened?

15:41.636 --> 15:44.204
I don't know.

15:44.247 --> 15:46.641
It's definitely not something
to laugh about.

15:49.644 --> 15:52.690
Oh, yeah? Well, me and
my boy toy, Winston,

15:52.734 --> 15:54.692
we gonna lie on the beach
in Jamaica

15:54.736 --> 15:57.869
and listen to reggae music
all day.

15:57.913 --> 15:58.914
Yeah, well, that's all right.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.437
Because I'm gonna be
on the couch

16:00.481 --> 16:01.830
while Monique feeds me

16:01.873 --> 16:04.876
the best macaroni and cheese
I've ever had.

16:04.920 --> 16:08.489
You said that I made
the best macaroni and cheese.

16:08.532 --> 16:09.490
You did.

16:09.533 --> 16:10.795
But you dead.

16:10.839 --> 16:12.449
Guys, please.

16:12.493 --> 16:14.538
No, no, no, no, no, no!
That-That's all right.

16:14.582 --> 16:15.844
'Cause I don't even
cook anymore.

16:15.887 --> 16:18.281
Yeah, me and Winston--
we hired a private chef

16:18.325 --> 16:21.284
with the money that we got
from selling your shop!

16:21.328 --> 16:22.764
Marty, when I die,

16:22.807 --> 16:24.548
burn down my shop.

16:25.680 --> 16:28.030
Okay! Before I get arrested
for arson

16:28.074 --> 16:31.991
and have to be bailed out
by my stepbrother/dad,

16:32.034 --> 16:34.906
can you both sit down
and be quiet?

16:34.950 --> 16:35.907
Fine.

16:35.951 --> 16:37.648
I was gonna sit down anyway.

16:39.868 --> 16:42.523
I can't believe you guys
are arguing about this.

16:42.566 --> 16:44.481
Do you know how lucky you are?

16:44.525 --> 16:46.483
People my age can't find
somebody to be with

16:46.527 --> 16:48.703
for more than
two weeks.

16:48.746 --> 16:50.487
If it weren't for you two, I...

16:50.531 --> 16:52.881
I wouldn't even
believe in love anymore.

16:54.665 --> 16:56.624
I mean,
look at you.

16:56.667 --> 16:58.930
After 30 years, you're both
still so in love with each other

16:58.974 --> 17:01.194
that you're jealous of people
that don't even exist.

17:04.806 --> 17:06.895
Monique Baker exists.

17:06.938 --> 17:09.376
You know, I would've
never even brought her up

17:09.419 --> 17:12.814
if you weren't so ready
to move on and forget about me.

17:14.120 --> 17:16.557
I could never
forget about you.

17:16.600 --> 17:17.819
Calvin, you're my soul mate.

17:17.862 --> 17:20.430
If I lost you,
I would be devastated.

17:22.563 --> 17:25.218
How devastated?

17:25.261 --> 17:28.960
Calvin, why are we even
talking about this?

17:29.004 --> 17:32.138
I don't want
to imagine life without you.

17:32.181 --> 17:34.357
I know.

17:34.401 --> 17:36.055
I'd miss me, too.

17:41.538 --> 17:43.627
Give me a kiss,
you big old...

17:43.671 --> 17:45.629
sexy honey bear, you.

17:45.673 --> 17:47.805
Come here.

17:47.849 --> 17:49.807
Okay, okay. If
you guys are good,

17:49.851 --> 17:51.809
let's get this over with.You know what, Marty,

17:51.853 --> 17:53.115
we're gonna have to do this
another time.

17:53.159 --> 17:55.813
Your mother and I have
some making up to do.

17:57.815 --> 18:00.514
Okay, that is it. Malcolm is
definitely inheriting the couch.

18:01.602 --> 18:03.604
Well, in that case,

18:03.647 --> 18:05.084
you ain't gonna want
the truck either.

18:10.176 --> 18:11.655
Hey, Malcolm.

18:11.699 --> 18:13.875
I was just coming over
to see how you're doing.

18:13.918 --> 18:14.876
I'm fine.

18:14.919 --> 18:16.660
Just went for a little walk.

18:16.704 --> 18:19.446
So, how'd the rest
of the night with Sofia go?

18:19.489 --> 18:20.621
Kind of weird.

18:20.664 --> 18:22.318
Dave tried to keep
her from laughing

18:22.362 --> 18:23.841
by talking about
the opioid crisis

18:23.885 --> 18:25.495
and how all the bees are dying.

18:28.194 --> 18:32.111
Hey, what did you mean when you
said you're the deal breaker?

18:32.154 --> 18:35.114
Look, Sofia is amazing.

18:35.157 --> 18:37.768
She's beautiful,
she's sophisticated,

18:37.812 --> 18:39.292
she's successful.

18:39.335 --> 18:40.902
But look at me, Gemma.

18:40.945 --> 18:43.861
I'm still living at home,
trying to get my life together.

18:43.905 --> 18:46.342
That's not how anyone sees you.

18:46.386 --> 18:48.127
You're a great guy.

18:48.170 --> 18:51.173
Well, maybe, but what do
I have to offer her?

18:51.217 --> 18:54.611
Aside from watching Netflix
on my parents' couch

18:54.655 --> 18:57.919
while my pops rubs
lotion on his feet.

18:59.442 --> 19:02.141
Yeah, he's done that
on our couch, too.

19:03.664 --> 19:06.623
Look, the fact is,

19:06.667 --> 19:09.409
Sofia's out of my league
right now.

19:09.452 --> 19:11.193
Malcolm...

19:11.237 --> 19:14.283
where you are now in your life
is gonna change.

19:14.327 --> 19:16.720
What's not gonna change

19:16.764 --> 19:18.766
is who you are.

19:18.809 --> 19:21.856
And Sofia likes who you are.

19:21.899 --> 19:24.424
She said that?

19:24.467 --> 19:26.643
Why don't you read
the text yourself?

19:30.256 --> 19:31.779
Oh.

19:31.822 --> 19:33.998
Well, she talks a lot
about my butt.

19:36.566 --> 19:38.568
Kind of makes me feel
like a piece of meat.

19:39.656 --> 19:40.744
I like that.

19:43.138 --> 19:45.619
Look, Sofia's a total catch,

19:45.662 --> 19:47.621
and you shouldn't
let her get away.

19:47.664 --> 19:50.841
And I would tell her
the exact same thing about you.

19:51.886 --> 19:53.627
Thank you, Gemma.

19:53.670 --> 19:55.411
I'm gonna go give her a call.

19:57.674 --> 20:01.287
Just like that, Dr. Wedding
Bells saves another patient.

20:02.375 --> 20:03.985
CALVIN:
Shut the damn door!

20:08.294 --> 20:10.252
Was he putting lotion
on his feet?

20:10.296 --> 20:11.384
Yeah, let's just go with that.

20:17.955 --> 20:19.479
So, before you married
Tina and were dating,

20:19.522 --> 20:20.828
did you have any deal breakers?

20:20.871 --> 20:22.395
I only had two rules, Dave.

20:22.438 --> 20:25.441
Pretty feet and a big ole butt.

20:26.921 --> 20:28.879
Well, what about with friends--

20:28.923 --> 20:30.272
any rules there?

20:30.316 --> 20:31.273
A bunch.

20:31.317 --> 20:32.970
No one from Michigan,

20:33.014 --> 20:34.450
no optimists

20:34.494 --> 20:37.540
and definitely
no one named Dave.

20:38.585 --> 20:40.064
Well, you know,

20:40.108 --> 20:42.284
I happen to have a
few rules of my own.

20:42.328 --> 20:44.547
All right.
Let's hear 'em.

20:44.591 --> 20:45.853
They have to be grumpy,

20:45.896 --> 20:47.507
they have to know everything

20:47.550 --> 20:51.206
and they definitely have
to be able to fix a car.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.557
Dave, if those are your rules,

20:54.601 --> 20:56.733
that would mean
we would be best friends.

20:56.777 --> 20:58.300
You said it, not me.

20:58.344 --> 20:59.519
Booyah!
