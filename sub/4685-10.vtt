Hello? Guys?

- Are we now playing
- hide-and-go-seek?

09:33.573 --> 09:35.814
- I'm afraid they are - now playing
- Hide from the geek.

09:41.540 --> 09:42.725
- You know, this is
- actually better.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.356
We're out of the sun,

09:44.357 --> 09:45.961
no bus fumes...

09:46.086 --> 09:47.587
- And the fuzz
- can't hassle us.

09:50.799 --> 09:52.510
- Hey, Emma.
- Are you limping?

09:52.634 --> 09:54.575
No. I'm not limping.

Yes, I can do math.

- I wasn't sure after
- seeing your spelling.

Ravi, you're soaking wet.

10:30.382 --> 10:31.882
What happened?

10:32.007 --> 10:33.821
I was trying to mingle

10:33.822 --> 10:35.635
and there was

10:32.007 --> 10:35.635
an irrigation mishap.

10:35.760 --> 10:36.928
It is not easy

10:36.929 --> 10:38.096
being the new kid.

10:38.222 --> 10:39.744
Mmm, tell me about it.

10:39.745 --> 10:41.266
I was a military brat.

10:41.392 --> 10:42.560
Well, (CHUCKLES)

10:42.561 --> 10:43.727
I wasn't a brat.

10:41.392 --> 10:43.727
I was precious.

- Is this going
- to take a while?

10:47.398 --> 10:48.962
Because this wet uniform

10:48.963 --> 10:50.526
is starting to chafe.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.569
Okay, the point is,

10:52.570 --> 10:54.488
the adult in me wants

10:50.650 --> 10:54.488
to say just be yourself

10:54.613 --> 10:56.781
and everything will be fine.

10:56.907 --> 10:58.301
- But the teenager in me
- knows that being yourself

10:58.325 --> 10:59.389
Can sometimes be

10:59.390 --> 11:00.452
a one-way ticket

10:58.325 --> 11:00.452

11:00.578 --> 11:05.541
a magical place

where everyone gets

11:06.689 --> 11:07.709
frozen yogurt.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.421
No, a swirly is

11:10.422 --> 11:11.671
a toilet shampoo.

So, no sprinkles?

11:14.633 --> 11:15.633
Sometimes.

11:18.262 --> 11:19.305
Maybe you could find

11:19.306 --> 11:20.347
someone you admire

11:18.262 --> 11:20.347
and try and be like them.

11:20.472 --> 11:22.871
Maybe I could.

18:00.019 --> 18:01.039
little brother alone.

18:01.164 --> 18:02.164
ALL: Ooh!

18:03.750 --> 18:07.004
Or else what, troll bait?

18:07.128 --> 18:08.213
Or else I'm going

18:08.214 --> 18:09.297
to break your

18:07.128 --> 18:09.297
mouth-breathing face.

18:09.965 --> 18:11.716
- (GRUNTING)
- Ooh.

18:17.931 --> 18:18.931
(NERVOUS LAUGHTER)

18:19.016 --> 18:20.079
Multi-grain!

18:20.080 --> 18:21.142
Don't mind if I do.

18:23.812 --> 18:26.794
(SCREAMS)

18:26.795 --> 18:29.776
It burns! Water! Water!

18:29.901 --> 18:31.987
(ALL LAUGHING)

18:32.111 --> 18:34.072
- Ravi, what was
- in that sandwich?

18:34.197 --> 18:36.199
Just bread, mayonnaise,

18:36.200 --> 18:38.201
and Indian

18:34.197 --> 18:38.201
dragon fire peppers.

18:38.326 --> 18:40.286
- One of the hottest
- peppers in the world.

18:40.411 --> 18:42.372
- (SCREAMS)
- My tongue, it's melting!

18:45.333 --> 18:46.668
Yes, yes,

18:46.669 --> 18:48.003
it has that effect.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.005
- Wait until
- the seeds kick in.

18:50.129 --> 18:53.216
(SCREAMS) It burns.

18:53.341 --> 18:55.426
And the seeds kicked in.

18:56.344 --> 18:57.637
(SCREAMS)

19:01.182 --> 19:02.182
(CHUCKLES)

19:08.231 --> 19:10.274
Mmm. Delicious.

19:10.400 --> 19:12.276
That was awesome.

19:12.402 --> 19:14.421
- But how do you - eat that without
- Screaming in pain?

19:14.445 --> 19:15.801
Where I come from,

19:15.802 --> 19:17.156
people sleep on

19:14.445 --> 19:17.156
beds of nails

19:17.281 --> 19:19.158
and walk on hot coals.

19:19.283 --> 19:20.535
This is nothing.

19:24.706 --> 19:25.812
Thanks, Bro.

19:25.813 --> 19:26.917
And I'm sorry

19:24.706 --> 19:26.917
if I acted like a jerk.

19:27.042 --> 19:28.356
You did,

19:28.357 --> 19:29.669
but I forgive you.

19:29.794 --> 19:30.859
Hey, want to come

19:30.860 --> 19:31.922
hang out with me

19:29.794 --> 19:31.922
and my friends?

19:32.047 --> 19:33.173
Thank you, but I have

19:33.174 --> 19:34.298
a prior engagement.

19:34.424 --> 19:35.633
- You are looking
- at the new

19:35.759 --> 19:37.281
Recording secretary

19:37.282 --> 19:38.803
of the reptile club.

19:43.058 --> 19:47.062
Hey, that's cool.

19:53.610 --> 19:55.028
(ALL PANTING)

19:58.865 --> 20:01.076
That ghastly little girl

20:01.077 --> 20:03.286
kept us all hostage

20:03.411 --> 20:04.955
in a moving sauna.

20:06.123 --> 20:07.290
(EXCLAIMS)

20:08.959 --> 20:11.210
Oh, never mind.

20:11.335 --> 20:13.025
There you are, Zuri.

20:13.026 --> 20:14.714
Why is it so hot in here?

20:14.839 --> 20:16.028
I find the space heater

20:16.029 --> 20:17.216
really moves product.

20:19.719 --> 20:20.929
That's basically extortion.

20:22.055 --> 20:24.682
But I made $300.

20:24.808 --> 20:26.392
- Who says crime
- doesn't pay?

20:28.352 --> 20:29.771
Let's go get you that doll.

20:29.896 --> 20:31.941
I can't. With the ticket,

20:31.942 --> 20:33.984
the space heater,

20:34.109 --> 20:35.294
- and this super-cute
- bathing suit,

20:35.318 --> 20:37.361
I think I'm still short.

20:41.032 --> 20:42.033
Ugh.

20:46.329 --> 20:48.748
Strange little girl,

20:49.874 --> 20:51.293
I told you no more

20:51.294 --> 20:52.710
selling lemonade

20:49.874 --> 20:52.710
in the building.

20:52.836 --> 20:54.713
Yes, ma'am.

20:54.714 --> 20:56.589
I know I was wrong,

20:56.714 --> 20:58.654
so to make up for it,

20:58.655 --> 21:00.593
I'm giving away free cookies.

21:00.718 --> 21:03.096
Really? That Bessie

21:03.097 --> 21:05.473
didn't make those, did she?

21:05.598 --> 21:06.933
No, they're Ravi's

21:06.934 --> 21:08.267
secret recipe.

21:08.392 --> 21:10.187
(CHUCKLES) I shouldn't.

21:11.896 --> 21:13.002
Oh, well. I did

21:13.003 --> 21:14.107
power walk today.

21:14.232 --> 21:15.609
To the Falafel Hut.

21:15.610 --> 21:16.985
(LAUGHS)

21:17.110 --> 21:18.110
How dare you judge me!

21:21.823 --> 21:23.366
My arm's getting tired.

21:25.660 --> 21:26.703
Well, if you insist.

21:26.828 --> 21:27.996
They're dragon fire

21:27.997 --> 21:29.164
chocolate chip.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.289
Mmm. (CHUCKLES)

21:32.375 --> 21:35.879
Mmm.

21:36.004 --> 21:39.257
Hot. Hot.

21:39.382 --> 21:40.258
So hot!

21:40.383 --> 21:41.488
Hotter than

21:41.489 --> 21:42.593
Anderson Cooper!

21:44.428 --> 21:46.056
(BABBLING)

21:46.181 --> 21:50.351
(SCREAMS) I need water!

21:50.476 --> 21:52.395
Water won't help.

21:52.396 --> 21:54.313
What you need is milk.

21:54.438 --> 21:56.107
Milk for sale.

21:56.108 --> 21:57.775
Milk for sale.

21:54.438 --> 21:57.775
Ten dollars a cup.

21:57.901 --> 21:59.903
(GASPING)

22:05.283 --> 22:07.077
I can't believe I wasted

22:07.078 --> 22:08.870
all that time on lemonade.

22:14.834 --> 22:17.420
(GASPS)

22:17.545 --> 22:19.964
Hey. Those are my shoes!

22:20.090 --> 22:22.330
- Oh, relax. - I'm just borrowing them
- Until you're 18.

22:25.344 --> 22:26.096
- Let me show you
- how it's done.

22:26.221 --> 22:27.722
Take notes.

22:29.140 --> 22:30.140
Whoa!
