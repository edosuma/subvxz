WEBVTT

00:15.181 --> 00:16.433
Go in peace.

00:17.976 --> 00:20.020
My loves, take care of yourselves.

00:23.648 --> 00:25.692
Dad, why aren't we going together?

00:26.276 --> 00:31.990
<i>Habibi</i>, you, Mom, and your siblings
will be in Houston very soon

00:32.073 --> 00:33.867
with Hakeem Olajuwon.

00:33.950 --> 00:38.413
Listen to me, Hamoodi,
be careful and look out for the family.

00:38.997 --> 00:40.665
Can I depend on you?

00:41.499 --> 00:42.417
Yes, <i>baba</i>.

00:43.585 --> 00:47.547
God bless you. That's what
I want to hear. Look what I've got you.

00:47.630 --> 00:51.843
Nothing in this life
breaks that cannot be fixed.

00:53.219 --> 00:57.307
What do you think?
So you can listen to music the entire way.

00:59.267 --> 01:00.310
Thank you, Dad.

01:00.393 --> 01:05.565
May God be pleased with you.
I'll see you soon, <i>habibi</i>.

01:27.253 --> 01:31.091
I got some brand-new Dita Grandmaster Six,

01:31.841 --> 01:35.428
rose gold-plated sunglasses.

01:36.012 --> 01:37.472
See how they feel.

01:37.555 --> 01:39.099
Check it out. Check it out.

01:39.182 --> 01:41.559
Ooh.

01:41.643 --> 01:42.977
Cold, bro.

01:43.061 --> 01:46.481
-You look amazing.
-Oh, yeah, yeah. These, these are it.

01:46.564 --> 01:50.568
Fire, bro. They're classic and timeless.
Just like my whip, bro.

01:50.652 --> 01:52.862
Hey, this ain't classic, it's just old.

01:54.572 --> 01:56.491
My father gave it to me before he died.

01:57.325 --> 01:58.952
I ain't mean no disrespect…

01:59.035 --> 01:59.994
Look, I can do 50.

02:00.078 --> 02:01.996
-Now you're being disrespectful.
-Hold on.

02:02.080 --> 02:05.416
-You don't deserve these, wasting time.
-Hey, whoa, wait, wait.

02:05.500 --> 02:07.961
-What?
-100 dollars. Talk to me. 100 dollars.

02:08.628 --> 02:09.796
Getting closer.

02:10.380 --> 02:12.423
-I'll throw in this leather case.
-Okay.

02:12.507 --> 02:16.636
Genuine leather, and this box
with the proper paperwork, 125.

02:16.719 --> 02:19.514
Period. Don't even try it, just say yes.

02:20.723 --> 02:23.268
All right, all right.
Yeah, you got a deal.

02:23.351 --> 02:25.645
-All right.
-Okay, okay. Ooh!

02:27.188 --> 02:29.315
Motherfuckers can't appreciate classics.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.780
It's my last one. My last one.

02:35.864 --> 02:37.490
Bam. My last one.

02:37.574 --> 02:40.869
Yo, hook it up.
For real, it's the last one this time.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.457
Perpetual motion. It's my last one.

02:47.375 --> 02:49.711
Perpetual motion. With the box.

02:50.587 --> 02:51.963
Last one this time.

02:54.257 --> 02:56.843
For real. Last one. Appreciate you.

02:57.927 --> 02:58.803
Oh, shit!

03:13.234 --> 03:14.986
Careful. Be careful, Mom.

03:19.365 --> 03:21.868
-Don't be silly. Can't rub it out.
-Son.

03:21.951 --> 03:25.705
I hope this isn't what you're wearing
for the <i>Azza </i>today.

03:25.788 --> 03:27.332
Wait, the <i>Azza </i>is today?

03:27.415 --> 03:31.294
Yes, today. It has been delayed
for over a month. Poor Samia.

03:31.377 --> 03:35.715
Mom, I can't go to the <i>Azza</i>.
I promised Maria we'd go on a picnic.

03:35.798 --> 03:38.218
I went to Abdullah's Bakery,
we have these pastries--

03:38.301 --> 03:41.596
I wish you'd order from Chick'n Cones.
We have perfect picnic selections.

03:41.679 --> 03:46.643
Look at my son, the romantic,
who wants to take Maria on a picnic.

03:46.726 --> 03:47.936
I don't want to hear that.

03:48.019 --> 03:50.688
Paying respect is a blessing.
You're coming.

03:50.772 --> 03:53.733
We have a variety of cones
that are perfect for a picnic.

03:53.816 --> 03:56.069
Okay, enough.
For the love of God.

03:56.152 --> 03:58.821
I'm going to the <i>Azza,</i>
but I'm bringing Maria.

03:58.905 --> 04:01.866
Allah! Girlfriends don't go to <i>Azzas</i>.

04:01.950 --> 04:04.369
What are you trying to do, embarrass me?

04:04.452 --> 04:06.204
Sweet, salty-sweet, buffalo--

04:06.287 --> 04:10.375
You said it's a blessing to go to an <i>Azza</i>.
For Maria to convert, she should come.

04:10.458 --> 04:12.961
-I wish you'd consulted me.
-Next picnic.

04:13.044 --> 04:14.087
I swear.

04:14.170 --> 04:15.296
Good afternoon.

04:15.380 --> 04:18.633
She's been waiting for 20
minutes. Can someone take care of her?

04:18.716 --> 04:20.176
I'm sorry, Ma'am. Sorry.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.387
So we got a deal or what?

04:22.470 --> 04:25.890
Yeah, just stop by the shop, okay?
Why is this still here?

04:25.974 --> 04:27.809
This had to be done
a week ago.

04:27.892 --> 04:28.726
What happened?

04:28.810 --> 04:32.188
Who left that stuff in here?
Someone's gonna have an accident.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.357
All this needs to move
to the back.

04:34.440 --> 04:36.734
Fucking pants. Cover that crack.

04:36.818 --> 04:41.114
This turned out really badass.
Polish it and deliver it to the client.

04:41.197 --> 04:42.407
Very nice.

04:42.490 --> 04:45.159
What's up? Find the part?
Tell the office to order it.

04:45.243 --> 04:47.412
It's gonna be 2,500
for the day.

04:47.495 --> 04:50.290
Really? Because your boss said 1,800.

04:50.373 --> 04:54.043
Yeah, but she wasn't here
for the full assessment like me, and…

04:54.127 --> 04:55.545
she's not really in charge.

04:55.628 --> 04:57.171
Screwing the customer over?

04:57.255 --> 05:04.012
No, I'm just factoring in labor and parts,
and this gringo's being a little bitch.

05:04.887 --> 05:08.099
Sorry, he's new here,
still learning. But I didn't say 1,800,

05:08.182 --> 05:09.267
I said 2,100.

05:09.350 --> 05:12.687
Oh, well, the guy down the street
said he could do it cheaper.

05:14.522 --> 05:17.650
-Which guy?
-His name was José or Carlos?

05:18.234 --> 05:19.485
Yordán, maybe.

05:19.569 --> 05:21.988
He's just listing Latinos
on the Astros.

05:22.071 --> 05:24.324
Go help the lady with her oil change.

05:24.907 --> 05:25.825
Yes, ma'am.

05:26.576 --> 05:30.038
This José, Juan, Pedro,
which one, how much was it?

05:30.121 --> 05:31.998
He just said it'd be cheaper.

05:33.499 --> 05:36.419
You didn't get a quote.
The shops here are full of gangsters,

05:36.502 --> 05:41.049
you'd shit your pants before getting one.
You want it fixed, it's 2,100, all right?

05:41.549 --> 05:42.550
Excuse me.

05:43.259 --> 05:44.177
Hey, babe.

05:45.053 --> 05:45.887
Ah!

05:46.387 --> 05:47.805
What, with your family?

05:49.223 --> 05:52.852
No, I want to go. I'd love to go.
I just need to change. Is that okay?

05:52.935 --> 05:54.062
I'll see you there.

06:02.028 --> 06:07.617
May he rest in peace. I'm sure
you'll find something to occupy your time.

06:07.700 --> 06:11.371
Yes, I love my children, however,
they're not everything in my life.

06:11.954 --> 06:13.414
-That's not true.
-What?

06:13.498 --> 06:17.752
I know you're trying to cheer me up,
but be real, Yusra.

06:17.835 --> 06:21.464
If you didn't have kids,
what would you do with your life?

06:22.715 --> 06:25.593
Samia, I would do lots of things.

06:25.676 --> 06:27.428
You take care of them,

06:27.512 --> 06:30.765
and Hamoodi brings home money,
even without papers.

06:30.848 --> 06:35.061
It's beautiful, but what about me?
No papers. No family.

06:37.063 --> 06:38.606
God blessed you with this child.

06:38.689 --> 06:41.526
So much torment.
He'll be with you all his life.

06:42.527 --> 06:43.820
Aunt Samia,

06:43.903 --> 06:46.489
I'm an adult.
I understand everything you're saying.

06:46.572 --> 06:48.616
I will get married one day.

06:48.699 --> 06:50.034
What a sense of humor.

06:56.833 --> 06:57.834
Hi, baby.

06:57.917 --> 06:58.918
Hello, love.

07:00.294 --> 07:02.255
-We can't kiss in here.
-What?

07:02.338 --> 07:05.758
I'm so sorry.
I know this is the opposite of a picnic.

07:05.842 --> 07:09.220
I know, but this is real shit.
I want to be there for your family.

07:09.720 --> 07:12.140
Maybe I'll finally connect with your mom.

07:12.223 --> 07:15.101
At an <i>Azza</i>? She's way too upset for that.

07:15.184 --> 07:18.271
Uncle Yusuf died.
By the way, legendary card player.

07:18.354 --> 07:21.274
-The Tiger Woods of Tarneeb.
-He was that good, huh?

07:21.357 --> 07:24.360
-Also, he cheated on Aunt Samia a bunch.
-Jesus, Mo!

07:24.444 --> 07:25.486
We say <i>"Isa."</i>

07:25.570 --> 07:26.529
<i>"Isa."</i>

07:27.405 --> 07:28.406
Sorry.

07:28.489 --> 07:30.575
-Okay, yeah. Okay.
-Come on.

07:34.745 --> 07:36.914
Peace and blessings.
May God have mercy.

07:37.498 --> 07:39.625
Mrs. Najjar,
nice to see you again.

07:40.376 --> 07:42.003
Mo, tell her to cover up.

07:43.004 --> 07:44.505
Mom is happy you came.

07:45.006 --> 07:48.301
-That's not what she said. She said--
-It's exactly what she said.

07:48.885 --> 07:53.055
Aunt Samia, I'm so sorry for your loss.
Must be really hard to lose him.

07:53.556 --> 07:57.518
Mohammed is a groom?
Soon you'll have grandchildren too, huh?

07:57.602 --> 08:01.147
No! That's like his sister.
She's just his friend.

08:02.148 --> 08:04.108
-She is beautiful. Lebanese, huh?
-Mexican.

08:04.984 --> 08:06.402
What are they saying?

08:06.486 --> 08:08.196
They like your dress.

08:08.279 --> 08:10.281
I heard them say "Mexican."

08:10.364 --> 08:13.451
No, only that she wants
to vacation in Mexico City.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.495
Samia.

08:15.578 --> 08:17.497
<i>Habibti</i>, how are you?

08:18.122 --> 08:23.419
I'm sorry about Yusuf.
We belong to Allah and to Him we return.

08:24.003 --> 08:24.837
So, Rhonda.

08:26.339 --> 08:32.053
Oh, it's the Najjars. Hi, how are you?
Who is this beautiful lady?

08:32.136 --> 08:35.848
Oh, this is Maria.
This is our immigration attorney, Modad.

08:35.932 --> 08:38.893
The one we've been trying
to get a hold of the last three weeks.

08:38.976 --> 08:40.228
<i>Habibi</i>, what is it?

08:40.311 --> 08:44.273
Didn't we talk the other day
about your Taco Cabana lawsuit thing?

08:44.357 --> 08:47.068
How did you come up with that?
What do you mean Taco Cabana?

08:47.151 --> 08:48.277
I have lots on my plate.

08:48.361 --> 08:51.322
-Must have been another Mohammed.
-You have more than one?

08:51.405 --> 08:53.157
Uh, six, maybe seven.

08:53.241 --> 08:55.535
But, Mo, you're my favorite Mohammed.

08:55.618 --> 08:56.619
It shows.

08:56.702 --> 08:59.497
I got a letter from
the asylum court. We need to take care--

08:59.580 --> 09:03.584
Now isn't the time to discuss business.
Samia's husband just died. Please.

09:03.668 --> 09:05.336
I'm sorry. Really sorry.

09:05.419 --> 09:09.507
I'll make your case a priority.
The best way to honor your husband.

09:09.590 --> 09:10.466
Thank you.

09:10.967 --> 09:14.595
I need the citizenship
to leave this country. Okay?

09:14.679 --> 09:18.975
Don't worry.
I got you. We'll figure out payment later.

09:23.312 --> 09:25.648
Her energy even brings the storm.

09:25.731 --> 09:29.360
Has she always been that mean
or is it because her husband died?

09:29.443 --> 09:33.906
No, she's always been that mean, Mom.
Her husband died to get away from her.

09:33.990 --> 09:36.409
Your lawyer's a bit scattered,
don't you think?

09:36.492 --> 09:40.037
-What do you mean "scattered"?
-Like, she's not on top of it.

09:40.121 --> 09:44.208
She's just saying she's busy.
She's gonna take me to the mobile shop.

09:44.709 --> 09:47.253
-Bye, Sameer. Goodbye, Mrs. Najjar.
-Bye, Maria.

09:47.336 --> 09:50.381
-Send greetings to Rahman.
-God willing. Will do.

09:50.464 --> 09:52.550
She still thinks
you're at Houston Mobile?

09:52.633 --> 09:53.843
I'm trying.

09:54.343 --> 09:57.388
She can handle you getting
shot, but not getting fired?

09:57.471 --> 10:00.850
-She fled a war.
-Exactly, I don't want to stress her out.

10:00.933 --> 10:02.935
Plus, I have a new interview.

10:03.019 --> 10:04.937
I hope it's with another lawyer.

10:05.855 --> 10:08.524
Listen, you can't criticize Modad
in front of my mom.

10:08.608 --> 10:09.483
Why not?

10:09.567 --> 10:12.945
Because Palestinians,
we're very loyal, we stick together.

10:13.029 --> 10:14.947
-We have a bond.
-She's terrible.

10:15.573 --> 10:18.200
It's not her fault our asylum
keeps getting pushed.

10:18.284 --> 10:21.912
How do you know? How are you so sure?
She doesn't return your calls.

10:21.996 --> 10:24.582
She doesn't have an assistant.
She's very hands-on.

10:24.665 --> 10:27.668
Mo, that's not good.
Professionals have assistants.

10:27.752 --> 10:30.129
She's got like what? A hundred clients?

10:30.212 --> 10:31.547
Thirty. Probably 30.

10:31.631 --> 10:34.258
Thirty? She's got six Mohammeds.

10:35.259 --> 10:38.596
So? I got like 20 Mohammeds
in my phone right now.

10:39.096 --> 10:40.806
Hammad, Abu Hammad, Abu Mohammad.

10:40.890 --> 10:43.059
-How many Josés do you know?
-Get in the car.

10:43.142 --> 10:45.186
Don't leave.
I don't wanna mess up my curls.

10:46.771 --> 10:50.149
Hey, man, I know aikido,
jiu jitsu, taekwondo, tai chi.

10:50.232 --> 10:52.151
I've been doing meditation techniques.

10:52.234 --> 10:54.320
I've mastered
the Filipino art form Kali sticks.

10:54.403 --> 10:56.822
-Helps with sword fighting--
-We don't need that shit.

10:56.906 --> 10:59.700
I'm not coming here
wearing all blacked-out…

10:59.784 --> 11:01.786
Just spittin' darts at people to…

11:01.869 --> 11:04.830
I'm not doing any that.
Just giving you options.

11:04.914 --> 11:07.667
We need a bouncer.
Do you know anything about strip clubs?

11:07.750 --> 11:12.004
I know everything about strip clubs, bro.
Three feet, don't touch the girls.

11:12.088 --> 11:14.256
Everybody pays their tab,
nobody gets rowdy.

11:14.340 --> 11:18.469
I'm really good at assessing situations,
if somebody's tipsy, I see trouble coming.

11:18.552 --> 11:20.471
I'll neutralize them
before problems happen.

11:20.554 --> 11:24.517
I can even DJ for you if you want.
"On the main stage, it's Chastity."

11:24.600 --> 11:26.435
Yeah, I like that. You Mexican?

11:26.519 --> 11:29.480
No, I'm not Mexican. No, but I'm Arab.

11:30.064 --> 11:31.899
But I speak Spanish. Yeah.

11:31.982 --> 11:35.695
Hi, how are you? Sit down
right here. I'd like a beer, please.

11:35.778 --> 11:38.239
-You don't have papers, do you?
-I mean…

11:38.322 --> 11:42.326
Say less. Wouldn't be our first illegal,
but you'd be our first Arab.

11:42.827 --> 11:46.455
And that would be
a historic hire for us here at Dreams.

11:49.125 --> 11:51.961
And that's something
you should be proud of.

11:52.044 --> 11:53.546
Mm…

11:53.629 --> 11:55.673
Glad I could break
that glass ceiling for you.

11:55.756 --> 11:58.801
I still have an interview
with a Samoan. All right.

11:58.884 --> 12:01.220
Right. I can start tonight if you want.

12:01.303 --> 12:04.140
No, I'll give you a call. Yeah. My man.

12:14.024 --> 12:14.859
Pick up.

12:17.278 --> 12:19.238
<i> Hi, you've reached Rhonda--</i>

12:19.321 --> 12:20.364
Unbelievable.

12:24.034 --> 12:26.495
<i>Okay. Carol, your spin.</i>

12:27.204 --> 12:30.750
-Mama, where are you going?
-Oh, I'm gonna go watch the birds.

12:30.833 --> 12:31.709
<i>Habibi</i>?

12:32.209 --> 12:33.043
Yeah?

12:34.003 --> 12:36.547
I have an active life, right?

12:36.630 --> 12:39.467
Yeah, of course, you do, Mama.
You've got a beautiful life.

12:39.550 --> 12:40.760
-Really?
-Yeah.

12:41.343 --> 12:42.887
-How?
-Well, you…

12:43.929 --> 12:46.849
You drive me to work.
You cook for me and Hamoodi.

12:46.932 --> 12:48.392
You do the groceries.

12:48.893 --> 12:50.811
Um, you… you do the laundry.

12:51.353 --> 12:52.480
Oh!

12:52.563 --> 12:54.315
And you got the lamp collection.

12:55.065 --> 12:56.150
Enough.

12:56.233 --> 12:57.485
Go to your birds.

13:27.181 --> 13:28.599
-Yes, Mom?
-Hi, son.

13:29.099 --> 13:30.726
I need you to get me olive.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.896
-You want me to get what?
-<i>I need raw olives today.</i>

13:33.979 --> 13:37.733
-Where do I get them from?
-Don't worry. I googled the address.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.026
-You what?
<i>Googled--</i>

13:39.109 --> 13:39.944
<i>Enough.</i>

13:40.027 --> 13:41.862
I'll send the address, just go there.

13:41.946 --> 13:43.531
Yes, ma'am.

13:47.368 --> 13:50.287
Yap, yap, yap,
like a little dog, that one.

13:50.788 --> 13:55.042
<i>Habibti</i>, my most important client
just walked in.

13:55.125 --> 13:57.294
Yes, okay, bye.

13:58.087 --> 14:01.257
The most important client
has to hunt you like a debt collector?

14:01.340 --> 14:05.594
Mo, I'm so glad you're here.
I just talked to the Taco Cabana lawyer--

14:05.678 --> 14:08.055
I didn't sue Taco Cabana!
What's wrong with you?

14:08.138 --> 14:10.057
I didn't slip on salsa. It's not me!

14:10.140 --> 14:14.728
Right, right, the court letter. My God!
I remember now. Well, did you bring it?

14:14.812 --> 14:15.896
Of course I did.

14:15.980 --> 14:17.189
Okay, <i>habibi</i>, okay.

14:22.486 --> 14:23.654
Mm.

14:23.737 --> 14:24.697
Mm-hm.

14:24.780 --> 14:26.240
-Ah.
-Mm.

14:26.323 --> 14:27.741
"Mm. Esh." What?

14:27.825 --> 14:31.620
Oh, oh, it's nothing.
We just have to file a few legal things.

14:31.704 --> 14:34.456
That's why I'm here.
Legal things. Do it now.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.041
Okay, okay.

14:36.125 --> 14:37.042
Mmm.

14:37.918 --> 14:39.128
Let me see.

14:42.298 --> 14:44.508
-Mohammed Ali, Mohammed Hadim,
-What's happening?

14:44.592 --> 14:49.680
-Mohammed Omar, 'Hamed…
-That's more than six Mohammeds.

14:51.348 --> 14:52.641
Najjar, Mo.

14:54.310 --> 14:56.770
Oof. Ah. I need a massage.

14:59.815 --> 15:01.817
-Let me see.
-There are two pieces of paper.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.904
There's three people in the case,
and you have two pieces of paper?

15:04.987 --> 15:05.988
<i>Habibi</i>, I swear,

15:06.071 --> 15:09.783
I can't find your brother's application,
but it's okay. It's fine.

15:09.867 --> 15:12.119
We'll Xerox yours and change the name.

15:12.202 --> 15:14.413
Modad, how many clients do you have?

15:14.496 --> 15:15.748
Give or take…

15:15.831 --> 15:17.833
-Two hundred or so.
-Two hundred?

15:17.917 --> 15:23.589
How the fuck did you get
200 clients in this incense shop?

15:23.672 --> 15:25.925
And where did this lady come from?

15:26.008 --> 15:30.054
She sprout from the floorboards,
saging everyone?

15:30.137 --> 15:32.765
<i>Habibi</i>, she's a healer.
It's all vibes.

15:32.848 --> 15:35.225
This whole place is an oxymoron.

15:35.309 --> 15:38.646
You're saying <i>hamdulillah</i>.
There's some weird God stuff.

15:38.729 --> 15:39.772
God forgive me.

15:39.855 --> 15:43.442
You don't even have
a secretary, but you hired a vibes lady?

15:43.525 --> 15:44.985
It's okay. I have Siri.

15:46.528 --> 15:48.113
-You're fired.
-What?

15:48.197 --> 15:49.615
I'm done with this shit.

15:49.698 --> 15:52.451
Mo, what are you doing?
Hear me out.

15:52.534 --> 15:54.662
I know that you're in the system,

15:54.745 --> 15:58.123
but without a lawyer,
ICE can detain you for weeks.

15:58.207 --> 16:00.918
Weeks? Takes me weeks
to get a hold of you.

16:01.752 --> 16:06.340
-Mohammed, no… What're you doing?
-And what the fuck is this?

16:06.924 --> 16:09.385
I'll have to get a new favorite Mohammed.

16:16.266 --> 16:18.185
Rhonda Modad, attorney at law.

16:30.239 --> 16:33.617
We don't sell olives to the public,
we're a wholesale supplier, but…

16:33.701 --> 16:34.910
at least you asked.

16:34.994 --> 16:38.163
Goddamn thieves
been stealing my crop all season.

16:38.247 --> 16:40.708
Where I come from,
olive theft is a huge problem, too.

16:40.791 --> 16:42.626
-Yeah? Where's that?
-Palestine.

16:42.710 --> 16:46.171
-Damn. That's a few hours away.
-Not Palestine, Texas.

16:46.255 --> 16:48.257
Palestine. You know,
land of milk and honey.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.718
-Uh, Israel, Manny, Israel.
-Oh. <i>Shalom</i>.

16:51.510 --> 16:53.262
Yeah, it's a real branding issue.

16:53.345 --> 16:57.516
You know, they make these olive trackers.
Look like the real thing.

16:57.599 --> 16:59.560
-No shit?
-You put them on the trees.

16:59.643 --> 17:02.896
Like a security system.
It's real beautiful out here, man.

17:02.980 --> 17:06.400
Thank you. This place has been
in my family five generations.

17:06.483 --> 17:07.985
-Oh, you don't say.
-Here.

17:08.068 --> 17:11.113
-These are on me. For the tracking tip.

17:12.239 --> 17:15.367
Great. You know my mama
is gonna really appreciate these.

17:15.451 --> 17:18.787
You're so generous.
Thank you so much, buddy.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.706
-You come back and see us.
-Yes.

17:21.540 --> 17:25.210
Does nobody shake hands anymore?
I'd rather you slapped my ass.

17:32.468 --> 17:34.178
Peace be upon you.

17:34.261 --> 17:37.556
And unto you peace.
You got me my olives.

17:37.639 --> 17:38.807
May God bless you.

17:38.891 --> 17:42.978
That olive farm is beautiful.
Not as beautiful as back home but nice.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.939
Nothing compares
to the Old Country.

17:46.023 --> 17:47.024
Of course.

17:47.107 --> 17:49.276
You're making olive oil again?

17:49.359 --> 17:54.865
Son, olive oil brings light,
and I want to lighten up my life.

17:54.948 --> 17:55.991
Hallelujah!

17:56.075 --> 17:59.828
I'm looking forward to
that olive oil with Zaatar and pastries.

18:01.038 --> 18:01.914
All of it.

18:01.997 --> 18:02.956
Um…

18:05.042 --> 18:06.877
I have something to tell you.

18:06.960 --> 18:07.920
Oh God.

18:10.422 --> 18:11.632
Maria's pregnant?

18:11.715 --> 18:12.674
With twins.

18:14.885 --> 18:16.095
No, it's not that.

18:17.179 --> 18:19.848
I fired Modad.
I'll find us a better option.

18:20.349 --> 18:21.475
I'll handle it.

18:21.558 --> 18:23.060
Because of Maria, huh?

18:23.977 --> 18:26.230
Yes. No. Kind of.

18:26.313 --> 18:27.439
That's it.

18:28.065 --> 18:32.528
How many years without any
progress? Loyalty has its limits. Good.

18:33.028 --> 18:34.988
You approve of Maria?

18:35.072 --> 18:38.867
-Forget it. I wanna work, get out.
-All right, okay.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.160
Give me my space.

19:55.277 --> 19:57.571
-Hello?
<i>-Hey, this is Rich from Dreams.</i>

19:58.614 --> 20:00.532
<i>We need a DJ if you're ready.</i>

20:00.616 --> 20:03.994
-Oh, yeah, I'm born ready.
-<i>Born ready? Get your ass up here.</i>

20:04.077 --> 20:05.746
My bad. I'll be right there.

20:08.248 --> 20:09.374
Huh…

20:20.552 --> 20:21.720
Mmm!

20:23.347 --> 20:25.682
Appreciate you coming
in last minute.

20:25.766 --> 20:29.144
I know you came for the bouncer job,
but the DJ fucked us.

20:29.937 --> 20:33.398
-There's more money in this anyway.
-Happy to play for the Dream Team.

20:33.482 --> 20:38.445
Yeah, well, the list is on the clipboard.
And, Mo, don't go talking that crazy shit.

20:38.528 --> 20:42.074
-Nobody comes to a strip club for the DJ.
-Let's see if we can change that.

20:42.157 --> 20:45.118
-All right. I appreciate you.
-All right. Appreciate you.

20:45.202 --> 20:47.287
-Make that money.
-Okay.

20:52.584 --> 20:55.963
How y'all doing out there?
Welcome to Dream Cabaret.

20:56.046 --> 21:01.385
The next dancer coming to the stage,
she's not Toyota. She's not Nissan.

21:01.468 --> 21:07.516
She is all German and all luxury.
Please give it up for Mercedes!

21:07.599 --> 21:11.770
Get to the front of that stage and throw
them dollars out at them ladies.

21:11.853 --> 21:16.483
The next dancer coming to the stage,
with a master's in clapping that ass.

21:16.566 --> 21:19.486
-Please give it up for Raven!

21:19.569 --> 21:24.324
Help her pay off her student loans.
Come on, take those dollar bills out.

21:24.408 --> 21:27.953
Get the money you saved
for your kid's college education.

21:28.036 --> 21:29.371
All right. All right.

21:37.629 --> 21:38.839
Oh, shit!

21:39.965 --> 21:41.758
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

21:45.762 --> 21:49.850
-What you doing down there?
-ICE, man. They catch us, we're fucked.

21:49.933 --> 21:51.518
You talking about Earl and Gene?

21:51.601 --> 21:55.355
They come every week
trying to get their dicks sucked.

21:55.439 --> 21:57.941
They ain't here for you. Check it. Earl!

21:58.817 --> 22:02.070
Take your jacket off!
You're scaring motherfuckers in here.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.530
What's wrong with you, man?

22:03.613 --> 22:07.701
-Can you get your dick sucked here?
-Stop being a bitch. Back to work!

22:31.725 --> 22:32.601
Yo, open up.

22:34.519 --> 22:35.520
Yo, Chien!

22:37.230 --> 22:39.191
-Mo? That's you?
-Stop fucking around.

22:40.192 --> 22:43.111
-Chien, it's Mo.
-All right. Chill out, man.

22:45.072 --> 22:49.076
Come on. Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.
Get in here, man. Making all that noise.

22:49.159 --> 22:53.080
Why do you have a sledgehammer?
Looking like an Asian Bob the Builder.

22:53.163 --> 22:55.832
-Man, I thought you were someone else.
-Who?

22:56.416 --> 22:59.294
Why are you walking in here
smelling like cigarettes and…

22:59.378 --> 23:00.545
What is that, failure?

23:00.629 --> 23:05.342
-I ain't got time for this. Hook me up.
-Another bottle? I just gave you three.

23:05.425 --> 23:10.013
I don't need a lecture from you.
Hook it up. Take the fucking money.

23:10.097 --> 23:12.140
It's not even about the money.

23:12.724 --> 23:15.519
About money my ass,
you took that fucking money.
