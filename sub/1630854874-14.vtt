>> John: WELCOME, WELCOME,

00:34.171 --> 00:34.735
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT!"

00:34.804 --> 00:35.703
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:35.772 --> 00:37.071
THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.

00:37.140 --> 00:38.139
IT'S BEEN A BUSY WEEK.

00:38.208 --> 00:38.773
SIDNEY POWELL PLED GUILTY IN THE

00:38.842 --> 00:40.241
2020 ELECTION INTERFERENCE CASE

00:40.310 --> 00:41.742
IN GEORGIA, AND JOE BIDEN FLEW

00:41.811 --> 00:43.678
TO ISRAEL TO OFFER HIS SUPPORT

00:43.747 --> 00:46.013
AMID THE ONGOING HOSTAGE CRISIS.

00:46.082 --> 00:47.415
IN GAZA, CONDITIONS ARE

00:47.484 --> 00:49.450
HORRENDOUS, FOLLOWING BRUTAL

00:49.519 --> 00:50.718
AIRSTRIKES, AND A BLOCKADE OF

00:50.787 --> 00:52.386
FOOD, FUEL AND WATER, WHICH SOME

00:52.455 --> 00:53.087
COMMENTATORS ARE JUST WAY TOO

00:53.156 --> 00:56.057
COMFORTABLE WITH.

00:56.126 --> 00:56.624
JUST LISTEN TO THIS EXCHANGE

00:56.693 --> 00:58.025
BETWEEN A RETIRED SENIOR

00:58.094 --> 00:58.659
MILITARY OFFICIAL AND AN ANCHOR

00:58.728 --> 01:03.531
ON CNN.

01:03.600 --> 01:04.165
>> I THINK WHAT THEY NEED TO DO

01:04.234 --> 01:05.366
IS ENCIRCLE IT, THEY NEED TO

01:05.435 --> 01:06.901
CONTINUE TO APPLY THE PRESSURE

01:06.970 --> 01:07.769
OF THE BRIGADE, OF THIS BLOCKADE

01:07.838 --> 01:09.170
THAT THEY'VE ESTABLISHED.

01:09.239 --> 01:10.138
THE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SUFFER,

01:10.207 --> 01:11.405
BUT THEY'RE GOING TO COME UP ON

01:11.474 --> 01:12.807
THE NET AND SAY, "LOOK, GET US

01:12.876 --> 01:14.142
OUT OF HERE."

01:14.211 --> 01:21.211
>> BUT DOES THAT MEAN -- YOU SAY

01:22.853 --> 01:23.417
SAY -- DOES THAT MEAN STARVE THE

01:23.486 --> 01:25.286
PALESTINIAN PEOPLE?

01:25.355 --> 01:25.920
CONTINUE TO, BECAUSE THEY WILL

01:25.989 --> 01:26.487
BE SO HUNGRY, AND WILL BE SO

01:26.556 --> 01:27.789
DESPERATE FOR WATER, AND

01:27.858 --> 01:29.490
MEDICINE, THAT THEN THEY WILL

01:29.559 --> 01:30.124
GIVE UP HAMAS?

01:30.193 --> 01:30.691
>> IT SOUNDS CALLOUS, BUT I

01:30.760 --> 01:35.196
MEAN, THIS IS A WAR.

01:35.265 --> 01:36.531
>> John: WHAT?!

01:36.600 --> 01:39.300
IT IS A WAR.

01:39.369 --> 01:41.135
YOU'RE DESCRIBING A WAR CRIME.

01:41.204 --> 01:41.736
ONE THING DOES NOT JUSTIFY THE

01:41.805 --> 01:46.541
OTHER.

01:46.610 --> 01:47.175
JUST A THOUGHT FOR THAT ANCHOR,

01:47.244 --> 01:48.876
WHO PROBABLY DIDN'T GET UP THAT

01:48.945 --> 01:49.610
MORNING THINKING HE'D HAVE TO

01:49.679 --> 01:51.112
GENUINELY EXPLAIN "YOU CAN'T

01:51.181 --> 01:52.480
STARVE PEOPLE" TO A FORMER US

01:52.549 --> 01:53.614
MILITARY OFFICIAL.

01:53.683 --> 01:54.215
BUT, WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON

01:54.284 --> 01:55.383
WASHINGTON THIS WEEK, WHERE

01:55.452 --> 01:56.417
REPUBLICANS STILL HAVEN'T

01:56.486 --> 01:57.752
MANAGED TO ELECT A NEW SPEAKER.

01:57.821 --> 01:58.352
JIM JORDAN WENT THROUGH THREE

01:58.421 --> 01:59.954
VOTES, ENJOYABLY LOSING SLIGHTLY

02:00.023 --> 02:02.457
MORE EACH TIME.

02:02.526 --> 02:03.524
AND AT ONE POINT, WAS

02:03.593 --> 02:04.125
PHOTOGRAPHED COMING OUT OF A

02:04.194 --> 02:05.226
CLOSED-DOOR MEETING WITH A

02:05.295 --> 02:06.994
HANDWRITTEN NOTE READING, "WHAT

02:07.063 --> 02:08.996
IS THE REAL REASON?"

02:09.065 --> 02:10.231
WHICH LOOKS LESS LIKE A BID TO

02:10.300 --> 02:11.265
BE SPEAKER AND MORE LIKE AN

02:11.334 --> 02:14.168
EARLY DRAFT OF A SUICIDE NOTE.

02:14.237 --> 02:15.303
THIS IS A HUMILIATING SITUATION

02:15.372 --> 02:17.004
FOR REPUBLICANS, ALTHOUGH ONE

02:17.073 --> 02:17.939
MEMBER DID HIS BEST TO SPIN THE

02:18.008 --> 02:20.608
CHAOS AS A POSITIVE.

02:20.677 --> 02:21.209
>> OUR DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES

02:21.278 --> 02:22.043
WILL NOT WORK WITH US ON A

02:22.112 --> 02:24.045
SINGLE THING TO SECURE THE

02:24.114 --> 02:25.146
BORDER, NOT ONE THING-

02:25.215 --> 02:25.980
>> YOU'RE THE ONES WHO CAN'T GET

02:26.049 --> 02:27.415
BEHIND A CANDIDATE HERE.

02:27.484 --> 02:28.483
>> WE ARE LAYING THIS ALL OUT IN

02:28.552 --> 02:29.584
PUBLIC VIEW, AND THE AMERICAN

02:29.653 --> 02:30.585
PEOPLE CAN SEE IT, IT IS THE

02:30.654 --> 02:32.053
SAUSAGE GETTING MADE, IT IS THE

02:32.122 --> 02:32.687
WORST SYSTEM EXCEPT FOR ALL THE

02:32.756 --> 02:36.891
OTHERS.

02:36.960 --> 02:37.892
>> YOU THINK THIS LOOKS GOOD?

02:37.961 --> 02:38.626
>> John: NO, IT DEFINITELY

02:38.695 --> 02:39.894
DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

02:39.963 --> 02:40.661
DO NOT CLAIM THAT YOU'RE "LAYING

02:40.730 --> 02:42.029
THIS MESS OUT IN PUBLIC TO BE

02:42.098 --> 02:42.697
TRANSPARENT ABOUT HOW THE

02:42.766 --> 02:44.132
SAUSAGE IS MADE."

02:44.201 --> 02:44.832
IT'S GETTING LAID OUT BECAUSE

02:44.901 --> 02:45.666
YOU'RE INCAPABLE OF MAKING A

02:45.735 --> 02:47.301
SAUSAGE AT ALL.

02:47.370 --> 02:48.302
WHEN PEOPLE GO TO THE GROCERY

02:48.371 --> 02:50.171
STORE, THEY EXPECT OSCAR MEYER

02:50.240 --> 02:51.672
WEINERS, NOT OSCAR MEYER "A PIG

02:51.741 --> 02:53.574
ANUS AND OTHER ASSORTED ANIMAL

02:53.643 --> 02:54.509
PARTS."

02:54.578 --> 02:55.910
AND TO BE FAIR, REPUBLICANS

02:55.979 --> 02:57.311
AREN'T ALONE IN DEALING WITH

02:57.380 --> 02:58.780
SOME PUBLIC EMBARRASSMENT.

02:58.849 --> 02:59.781
DEMOCRATIC NEW JERSEY SENATOR

02:59.850 --> 03:01.682
BOB MENENDEZ IS FACING FEDERAL

03:01.751 --> 03:02.717
CHARGES FOR ALLEGEDLY ACCEPTING

03:02.786 --> 03:04.352
BRIBES TO HELP, AMONG OTHERS,

03:04.421 --> 03:05.586
THE EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT, IN

03:05.655 --> 03:06.954
FORMS INCLUDING GOLD BARS AND

03:07.023 --> 03:08.890
STACKS OF CASH.

03:08.959 --> 03:09.724
AND, THE STORY JUST KEEPS

03:09.793 --> 03:11.159
DEVELOPING.

03:11.228 --> 03:12.326
>> BOB MENENDEZ IS FACING NEW

03:12.395 --> 03:13.694
CHARGES, ACCUSING THE NEW JERSEY

03:13.763 --> 03:14.929
DEMOCRAT OF PLOTTING WITH HIS

03:14.998 --> 03:16.397
WIFE AND AN ASSOCIATE TO MAKE

03:16.466 --> 03:19.133
THE SENATOR AN AGENT OF EGYPT,

03:19.202 --> 03:19.934
WHILE HE WAS CHAIRMAN OF THE

03:20.003 --> 03:21.736
FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE.

03:21.805 --> 03:22.603
THE NEW INDICTMENT SHOWING

03:22.672 --> 03:24.038
MENENDEZ AND HIS WIFE HOSTING

03:24.107 --> 03:25.239
ONE EGYPTIAN OFFICIAL IN HIS

03:25.308 --> 03:26.507
SENATE OFFICE AND DINING WITH

03:26.576 --> 03:28.209
ANOTHER AT A WASHINGTON, D.C.

03:28.278 --> 03:29.410
STEAKHOUSE.

03:29.479 --> 03:30.611
AT THAT DINNER, NADINE MENENDEZ

03:30.680 --> 03:32.280
ALLEGEDLY ASKING, "WHAT ELSE CAN

03:32.349 --> 03:34.816
THE LOVE OF MY LIFE DO FOR YOU?"

03:34.885 --> 03:36.150
>> John: I DON'T LIKE THAT AT

03:36.219 --> 03:38.753
ALL.

03:38.822 --> 03:40.321
THAT SOUNDS LESS LIKE A REQUEST

03:40.390 --> 03:41.522
FOR BRIBES AND MORE LIKE A

03:41.591 --> 03:42.824
COUPLE IN AN OPEN RELATIONSHIP,

03:42.893 --> 03:44.258
COMING ON A LITTLE TOO STRONG TO

03:44.327 --> 03:46.093
YOU AT A BAR.

03:46.162 --> 03:47.195
"WHAT ELSE CAN THE LOVE OF MY

03:47.264 --> 03:49.730
LIFE DO FOR YOU THIS EVENING?"

03:49.799 --> 03:50.531
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!

03:50.600 --> 03:53.234
LEAVE ME ALONE.

03:53.303 --> 03:54.302
AND, THE WEIRD DETAILS DON'T

03:54.371 --> 03:54.969
STOP THERE.

03:55.038 --> 03:55.803
>> FEDERAL PROSECUTORS SAY

03:55.872 --> 03:57.305
SENATOR MENENDEZ LIFTED A BLOCK

03:57.374 --> 03:58.372
ON U.S. MILITARY AID TO EGYPT,

03:58.441 --> 04:00.274
TEXTING HIS WIFE, "TELL WILL I

04:00.343 --> 04:04.979
AM GOING TO SIGN OFF THIS SALE

04:05.048 --> 04:06.514
TO EGYPT TODAY, 10,000 ROUNDS

04:06.583 --> 04:08.116
TANK AMMUNITION."

04:08.185 --> 04:09.016
>> John: OH THAT SOUNDS FINE,

04:09.085 --> 04:10.952
JUST SOME NORMAL COUPLE STUFF,

04:11.021 --> 04:11.986
TEXTING ABOUT THOUSANDS OF

04:12.055 --> 04:13.988
ROUNDS OF TANK AMMUNITION.

04:14.057 --> 04:14.856
ACCORDING TO THE INDICTMENT,

04:14.925 --> 04:15.756
THAT TEXT EVENTUALLY GOT

04:15.825 --> 04:17.391
FORWARDED TO EGYPTIAN OFFICIALS,

04:17.460 --> 04:18.159
ONE OF WHOM REPLIED SIMPLY WITH

04:18.228 --> 04:21.195
A "THUMBS UP" EMOJI.

04:21.264 --> 04:22.530
AND, COME ON.

04:22.599 --> 04:23.164
YOU'RE CONFIRMING THE RECEIPT OF

04:23.233 --> 04:24.665
TANK AMMUNITION WITH A THUMBS

04:24.734 --> 04:25.533
UP?

04:25.602 --> 04:26.901
HAVE SOME PANACHE!

04:26.970 --> 04:28.202
WHERES THE DOLLAR HANDSHAKE OR

04:28.271 --> 04:31.606
THE MONEYBAG BOMB CHAMPAGNE SHHH

04:31.675 --> 04:33.074
OR THE FLYING MONEY AND THE

04:33.143 --> 04:34.275
TRUCK, MAKING THE OTHER GUY GO

04:34.344 --> 04:35.443
"WHAT IS THE TRUCK FOR?"

04:35.512 --> 04:36.077
ONLY TO GET THE RESPONSE, "THEY

04:36.146 --> 04:38.045
DON'T HAVE TANKS, THAT WAS THE

04:38.114 --> 04:39.113
BIGGEST TRUCK," GETTING THE

04:39.182 --> 04:40.748
REPLY, "OKAY, GOT IT, COOL."

04:40.817 --> 04:41.382
AND THEN, AND ONLY THEN, IS THE

04:41.451 --> 04:44.519
THUMBS-UP EMOJI APPROPRIATE.

04:44.588 --> 04:45.720
NOW, MENENDEZ - ALONG WITH

04:45.789 --> 04:46.621
EVERYONE ELSE CHARGED IN THIS

04:46.690 --> 04:48.089
CASE - HAS DENIED WRONGDOING,

04:48.158 --> 04:49.757
AND SAID THIS WEEK "NOTHING HAS

04:49.826 --> 04:50.424
CHANGED IN THIS INDICTMENT

04:50.493 --> 04:51.793
EXCEPT THE NEW CHARGE."

04:51.862 --> 04:52.393
THOUGH, THAT NEW CHARGE IS A

04:52.462 --> 04:54.762
PRETTY GIGANTIC ONE.

04:54.831 --> 04:55.363
AND IT'S NOT A GREAT SIGN THAT

04:55.432 --> 04:56.631
POLITICO RAN THE ACTUAL

04:56.700 --> 04:58.132
HEADLINE, "IS IT LEGAL FOR A

04:58.201 --> 04:59.967
SENATOR TO WORK AS A FOREIGN

05:00.036 --> 05:00.968
AGENT?

05:01.037 --> 05:03.171
THE ANSWER WON'T SURPRISE YOU."

05:03.240 --> 05:05.206
AND IF YOU'RE NOTICING THAT

05:05.275 --> 05:06.541
MENENDEZ'S WIFE, NADINE IS

05:06.610 --> 05:08.709
FEATURING A LOT IN THIS STORY,

05:08.778 --> 05:09.343
IT'S BECAUSE SHE'S ACTUALLY BEEN

05:09.412 --> 05:11.012
CHARGED, TOO.

05:11.081 --> 05:11.913
ACCORDING TO THE INDICTMENT,

05:11.982 --> 05:13.548
SOME OF THE ITEMS OF VALUE THAT

05:13.617 --> 05:14.282
MENENDEZ RECEIVED WERE FOR HER

05:14.351 --> 05:15.683
BENEFIT.

05:15.752 --> 05:16.317
IT MENTIONS THAT AT ONE POINT,

05:16.386 --> 05:17.852
SHE TOTALED HER CAR -- SOMETHING

05:17.921 --> 05:18.920
THAT HAPPENED, INCIDENTALLY,

05:18.989 --> 05:20.455
WHEN SHE HIT AND KILLED A MAN IN

05:20.524 --> 05:22.089
2018 -- WHICH I DON'T EVEN HAVE

05:22.158 --> 05:23.458
TIME TO GET INTO.

05:23.527 --> 05:24.759
GOOGLE THAT YOURSELVES.

05:24.828 --> 05:25.626
AND, THE INDICTMENT ALLEGES THAT

05:25.695 --> 05:27.228
THIS BUSINESSMAN HELPED HER PAY

05:27.297 --> 05:28.863
FOR THIS NEW $60,000 MERCEDES IN

05:28.932 --> 05:30.064
EXCHANGE FOR FAVORS FROM

05:30.133 --> 05:31.766
MENENDEZ.

05:31.835 --> 05:32.700
AND WHEN THE CAR TURNED UP,

05:32.769 --> 05:35.570
NADINE SEEMED VERY HAPPY.

05:35.639 --> 05:36.971
>> PROSECUTORS SAY THAT AFTER

05:37.040 --> 05:38.639
NADINE MENENDEZ GOT THE NEW CAR,

05:38.708 --> 05:41.075
SHE TEXTED THE SENATOR, QUOTE,

05:41.144 --> 05:42.543
"CONGRATULATIONS MON AMOUR DE LA

05:42.612 --> 05:43.878
VIE, WE ARE THE PROUD OWNERS OF

05:43.947 --> 05:45.847
A 2019 MERCEDES," ALONG WITH A

05:45.916 --> 05:48.616
HEART EMOJI.

05:48.685 --> 05:49.450
>> John: WOW, SAY WHAT YOU WANT

05:49.519 --> 05:51.285
ABOUT NADINE MENENDEZ -- AND

05:51.354 --> 05:53.054
THAT PEDESTRIAN SHE RAN OVER

05:53.123 --> 05:54.122
CERTAINLY CAN'T -- BUT SHE LOVES

05:54.191 --> 05:56.224
THAT CAR.

05:56.293 --> 05:56.791
AND, BY THE WAY, NOT A GREAT

05:56.860 --> 05:58.926
LOOK FOR MERCEDES THERE.

05:58.995 --> 06:00.895
NOW, ARE THE MENEDEZES THE WORST

06:00.964 --> 06:01.529
POLITICAL FIGURES THAT MERCEDES,

06:01.598 --> 06:02.964
AS A BRAND, HAS EVER BEEN

06:03.033 --> 06:04.499
ASSOCIATED WITH?

06:04.568 --> 06:05.833
NO, THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE THIS

06:05.902 --> 06:09.036
GUY.

06:09.105 --> 06:09.670
ALTHOUGH, TO BE FAIR, IT'S NOT

06:09.739 --> 06:11.339
LIKE MERCEDES IS THE CAR OF

06:11.408 --> 06:12.940
CHOICE FOR NAZIS ANYMORE.

06:13.009 --> 06:14.308
THESE DAYS, THAT'S REALLY MORE

06:14.377 --> 06:16.744
OF A TESLA THING.

06:16.813 --> 06:18.479
THE MENENDEZES HAVE CLEARLY

06:18.548 --> 06:22.650
GOTTEN THEMSELVES INTO AN

06:22.719 --> 06:24.285
IMPRESSIVE AMOUNT OF SHIT FOR A

06:24.354 --> 06:24.919
COUPLE THAT APPARENTLY ONLY MET

06:24.988 --> 06:25.920
FIVE YEARS AGO.

06:25.989 --> 06:27.021
AND IN SOME PRETTY STRANGE

06:27.090 --> 06:28.256
CIRCUMSTANCES.

06:28.325 --> 06:28.890
>> THE COUPLE TOLD THE NEW YORK

06:28.959 --> 06:30.091
TIMES THEY MET IN DECEMBER 2018

06:30.160 --> 06:30.691
AT AN IHOP IN UNION CITY, NEW

06:30.760 --> 06:31.659
JERSEY.

06:31.728 --> 06:32.426
SHE TOLD THE NEW YORK TIMES SHE

06:32.495 --> 06:34.996
THOUGHT MENENDEZ WAS "VERY

06:35.065 --> 06:35.730
INTELLIGENT," AND "VERY, VERY

06:35.799 --> 06:37.999
HOT."

06:38.068 --> 06:39.167
>> John: OKAY, I'LL BE HONEST --

06:39.236 --> 06:41.035
IF SOMEONE TOLD ME THEY FOUND

06:41.104 --> 06:42.737
THIS MAN TO BE "VERY, VERY HOT,"

06:42.806 --> 06:44.505
I THINK MY ONLY LOGICAL RESPONSE

06:44.574 --> 06:45.139
WOULD BE, "YOU MEAN LIKE, TO THE

06:45.208 --> 06:48.009
TOUCH?

06:48.078 --> 06:49.777
IS HE OKAY?"

06:49.846 --> 06:50.411
BECAUSE, HE LOOKS LIKE A KEEBLER

06:50.480 --> 06:52.947
ELF BECAME A TAX ACCOUNTANT.

06:53.016 --> 06:53.714
HE LOOKS LIKE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

06:53.783 --> 06:57.218
IF YOU COMBINED THE OLD MAN AND

06:57.287 --> 06:59.120
THE LITTLE BOY FROM "UP" INTO A

06:59.189 --> 07:00.354
SINGLE PERSON.

07:00.423 --> 07:00.955
AND, LET'S NOT SKIP OVER THEIR

07:01.024 --> 07:03.624
MEETING PLACE -- AN IHOP IN

07:03.693 --> 07:04.125
UNION CITY, NEW JERSEY.

07:04.194 --> 07:05.660
THAT'S NOT A MEET-CUTE.

07:05.729 --> 07:06.194
THAT'S A

07:06.263 --> 07:09.197
MEET-CLINICALLY-DEPRESSED.

07:09.266 --> 07:10.164
"AN IHOP IN NEW JERSEY" IS NOT

07:10.233 --> 07:11.499
WHERE YOU EXPECT A SENATOR TO

07:11.568 --> 07:15.236
MEET HIS WIFE.

07:15.305 --> 07:16.771
IT'S WHERE YOU EXPECT A CUSTOMER

07:16.840 --> 07:18.606
TO MEET "THEIR OWN PERSONAL ROCK

07:18.675 --> 07:19.941
BOTTOM."

07:20.010 --> 07:20.575
AND I'D SAY "MEETING AT A UNION

07:20.644 --> 07:21.776
CITY IHOP" IS THE MOST JERSEY

07:21.845 --> 07:22.510
THING ABOUT THIS COUPLE, BUT IT

07:22.579 --> 07:23.311
ISN'T.

07:23.380 --> 07:24.412
NOT ONLY DOES NADINE HAVE

07:24.481 --> 07:25.546
MULTIPLE PICTURES WITH CAST

07:25.615 --> 07:26.747
MEMBERS OF THE REAL HOUSEWIVES

07:26.816 --> 07:27.782
OF NEW JERSEY AND MOB WIVES, BUT

07:27.851 --> 07:29.484
PERHAPS THE PHOTO OF HER THAT

07:29.553 --> 07:30.118
SCREAMS "NEW JERSEY" THE MOST IS

07:30.187 --> 07:32.620
THIS ONE.

07:32.689 --> 07:34.956
LOOK AT THESE JEANS.

07:35.025 --> 07:36.657
THEY ARE IN ITALY IN THIS PHOTO.

07:36.726 --> 07:39.160
ITALY.

07:39.229 --> 07:40.628
HOME OF PRADA, GUCCI, AND

07:40.697 --> 07:41.796
ARMANI, YET SHE LOOKS LIKE SHE'S

07:41.865 --> 07:43.331
ON THE DISNEY CHANNEL RED CARPET

07:43.400 --> 07:47.969
IN 2005.

07:48.038 --> 07:49.137
THIS IS A CHAOTIC RELATIONSHIP.

07:49.206 --> 07:51.839
THEY GOT ENGAGED ON A TRIP TO

07:51.908 --> 07:52.940
INDIA, AND THERE'S ACTUALLY

07:53.009 --> 07:54.909
VIDEO OF THE PROPOSAL, WHERE

07:54.978 --> 07:55.943
YOU'LL SEE MENENDEZ SERENADING

07:56.012 --> 07:57.912
NADINE WITH A NUMBER FROM "THE

07:57.981 --> 07:58.546
GREATEST SHOWMAN" BEFORE POPPING

07:58.615 --> 08:00.081

08:24.441 --> 08:25.640
IT DOESN'T LOOK GREAT NOW TO

08:25.709 --> 08:27.074
HEAR THE WORLD'S OLDEST THEATER

08:27.143 --> 08:28.376
KID SING ABOUT HOW "TOWERS OF

08:28.445 --> 08:29.844

08:29.913 --> 08:31.612
HIM, GIVEN THE MULTIPLE GOLD

08:31.681 --> 08:33.047
BARS THAT WERE FOUND IN HIS

08:33.116 --> 08:35.216
HOUSE.

08:35.285 --> 08:36.451
I DON'T CARE HOW MUCH YOU LIKE A

08:36.520 --> 08:37.218
SONG, IF IT SOUNDS THAT MUCH

08:37.287 --> 08:38.820
LIKE A CONFESSION, MAYBE DON'T

08:38.889 --> 08:40.922
SING IT IN PUBLIC.

08:40.991 --> 08:41.689
IT'S ONE OF THE MANY REASONS THE

NEW SWEENEY TODD REVIVAL ON

08:43.393 --> 08:44.292
BROADWAY STARS JOSH GROBAN AND

08:44.361 --> 08:45.927
NOT O.J. SIMPSON.

08:45.996 --> 08:47.261
BECAUSE REGARDLESS OF HOW GOOD

08:47.330 --> 08:49.630
JUICE WOULD BE IN THE ROLE, THE

08:49.699 --> 08:50.264
KNIFE CRIMES HAPPENING ON STAGE

08:50.333 --> 08:51.666
WOULDN'T BE THE ONES I'D BE

08:51.735 --> 08:53.935
THINKING ABOUT.

08:54.004 --> 08:54.635
NOW, MENENDEZ HAS STEPPED DOWN

08:54.704 --> 08:56.571
AS CHAIR OF THE SENATE FOREIGN

08:56.640 --> 08:58.239
RELATIONS COMMITTEE, BUT IS

08:58.308 --> 08:58.840
FACING INCREASING CALLS FROM

08:58.909 --> 09:00.975
WITHIN HIS OWN PARTY TO STEP

09:01.044 --> 09:02.543
DOWN AS SENATOR ALTOGETHER -- A

09:02.612 --> 09:03.811
MOVE THAT APPARENTLY 70% OF NEW

09:03.880 --> 09:05.880
JERSEYANS SUPPORT.

09:05.949 --> 09:07.381
WHICH IS STRIKING.

09:07.450 --> 09:08.783
IT'S HARD TO THINK OF SOMEONE

09:08.852 --> 09:10.118
THAT NEW JERSEYANS HATE MORE

09:10.187 --> 09:10.751
THAN MENENDEZ.

09:10.820 --> 09:12.887
NOT IMPOSSIBLE.

09:12.956 --> 09:14.455
JUST HARD.

09:14.524 --> 09:16.457
THE POINT IS: BOB MENENDEZ IS

09:16.526 --> 09:18.793
CLEARLY IN A LOT OF TROUBLE.

09:18.862 --> 09:19.427
AND WHILE I DON'T KNOW WHERE HIS

09:19.496 --> 09:21.362

RESIGN FROM CONGRESS, I AND THE

09:25.302 --> 09:26.601

09:28.438 --> 09:29.937
EMOJI.

09:30.006 --> 09:31.973

09:33.643 --> 09:37.345

09:54.798 --> 09:55.630
IT TURNS ME ON.

09:55.699 --> 09:57.532
WHAT TURNS ME ON IS GOOGLE AND

09:59.803 --> 10:00.301
THE IDEA OF THAT YARD SALE

10:00.370 --> 10:01.169

10:39.075 --> 10:40.174
A WORD THAT SOMEHOW DESCRIBES

10:50.820 --> 10:51.752
TONIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON

10:51.821 --> 10:53.221
THE OLDEST AND LARGEST ONE:

10:53.290 --> 10:54.655
McKINSEY & COMPANY.

10:54.724 --> 10:55.523
IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR NEARLY A

10:55.592 --> 10:56.824
CENTURY, ADVISING BOTH BIG

10:56.893 --> 10:57.892
COMPANIES AND GOVERNMENT

10:57.961 --> 10:59.026
AGENCIES ON HOW TO FIX THEIR

10:59.095 --> 11:00.461
MOST COMPLEX AND URGENT

11:00.530 --> 11:01.629
PROBLEMS.

11:01.698 --> 11:03.097
>> McKINSEY WAS FOUNDED IN 1926

11:03.166 --> 11:04.699
BY JAMES O McKINSEY.

11:04.768 --> 11:06.033
HE WAS A PROFESSOR AT THE

11:06.102 --> 11:07.668
UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO AND AN

11:07.737 --> 11:10.371
EXPERT IN MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING.

11:10.440 --> 11:11.272
BY THE 1950S, THE FIRM WAS

11:11.341 --> 11:13.207
ASSISTING THE WHITE HOUSE WITH

11:13.276 --> 11:14.542
STAFFING ORGANIZATION, WHICH,

11:14.611 --> 11:15.810
ACCORDING TO THE COMPANY, WOULD

11:15.879 --> 11:17.779
LEAD TO THE CREATION OF THE

11:17.848 --> 11:19.781
CHIEF OF STAFF ROLE.

11:19.850 --> 11:21.115
IN 1970, McKINSEY HELPED CREATE

11:21.184 --> 11:23.351
THE BARCODE.

11:23.420 --> 11:27.321
YES, THAT BAR CODE.

11:27.390 --> 11:28.489
>> John: THAT'S TRUE!

11:28.558 --> 11:29.123
McKINSEY DID HELP INVENT THE BAR

11:29.192 --> 11:31.926
CODE.

11:31.995 --> 11:32.727
AND I KNOW THAT'S DISAPPOINTING.

11:32.796 --> 11:33.861
MAYBE YOU THOUGHT IT WAS

11:33.930 --> 11:35.129
INVENTED BY A GROCER IN THE 60S

11:35.198 --> 11:36.764
WHO DREAMT OF A WAY FOR

11:36.833 --> 11:39.133
COMPUTERS TO TASTE FRUIT.

11:39.202 --> 11:40.268
MAYBE, YOU THOUGHT THE BEEPS

11:40.337 --> 11:41.936
WERE JUST HOW THE PROGRAM SAYS

11:42.005 --> 11:43.104
"YUM."

11:43.173 --> 11:43.738
BUT, I'M AFRAID YOU'RE IMAGINING

11:43.807 --> 11:44.772
A BETTER WORLD THAN THE ONE WE

11:44.841 --> 11:46.207
LIVE IN.

11:46.276 --> 11:46.974
BUT, IT'S NOT JUST BAR-CODE

11:47.043 --> 11:48.209
INNOVATION.

11:48.278 --> 11:48.743
FIRMS LIKE McKINSEY SELL

11:48.812 --> 11:49.977

11:58.688 --> 11:59.821

EVERYONE, FROM COMPANIES LIKE

12:04.828 --> 12:07.528
COCA COLA, BEST BUY, AND AT&T TO

12:07.597 --> 12:08.729
GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, LIKE THE

12:08.798 --> 12:10.731
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND ICE.

12:10.800 --> 12:12.967
McKINSEY IS MASSIVE, AND

12:13.036 --> 12:14.268
UBIQUITOUS -- IT HAS OFFICES IN

12:14.337 --> 12:17.205
AT LEAST 65 COUNTRIES, AND AN

12:17.274 --> 12:18.272
ANNUAL REVENUE ESTIMATED AT $15

12:18.341 --> 12:20.808
BILLION.

12:20.877 --> 12:22.143
BUT, McKINSEY DOESN'T SEE ITSELF

12:22.212 --> 12:23.544
AS JUST A BUNCH OF

THEMSELVES AS OPERATING AS A

POSITIVE ENDURING CHANGE IN THE

12:40.897 --> 12:41.462
>> THE WORK YOU DO WITH McKINSEY

12:41.531 --> 12:42.597
WILL MATTER.

12:42.666 --> 12:43.264
>> WHAT WE ARE DOING ON A DAY TO

McKINSEY IS IT PROVIDES YOU WITH

12:48.071 --> 12:48.936
AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK ON REALLY

12:49.005 --> 12:50.505
HARD PROBLEMS THAT ARE ALSO

12:50.574 --> 12:52.306
REALLY INTERESTING, AND ALSO

12:52.375 --> 12:54.909
REALLY ACTUALLY MATTER

12:54.978 --> 12:56.110
>> John: RIGHT.

12:56.179 --> 12:57.378
McKINSEY CONSULTANTS ARE

12:57.447 --> 12:58.846
ENCOURAGED TO SEE THEMSELVES AS

12:58.915 --> 13:01.616
WORLD-CHANGERS.

13:01.685 --> 13:02.216
AS A HUMBLE McKINSEY PARTNER

13:02.285 --> 13:03.151
ONCE PUT IT, "THERE ARE ONLY

13:03.220 --> 13:04.185
THREE GREAT INSTITUTIONS LEFT IN

13:04.254 --> 13:05.453
THE WORLD: THE MARINES, THE

13:05.522 --> 13:06.854
CATHOLIC CHURCH, AND McKINSEY."

13:06.923 --> 13:07.822
WHICH IS A HELL OF A GROUP TO

13:07.891 --> 13:10.691
PUT YOURSELF IN.

13:10.760 --> 13:11.359
"LOOK -- THERE'S JUST THREE COOL

KISSINGER, KEVIN SPACEY, AND

13:14.231 --> 13:17.598
ME."

13:17.667 --> 13:18.800
AND THE TRUTH IS, McKINSEY'S

13:18.869 --> 13:20.868
REPUTATION HAS TAKEN A BIT OF A

13:20.937 --> 13:21.736
KNOCK IN RECENT YEARS.

13:21.805 --> 13:22.670
IT'S FOUND ITSELF UNDER SCRUTINY

13:22.739 --> 13:23.805
FOR EVERYTHING FROM EXACERBATING

13:23.874 --> 13:25.440
INCOME INEQUALITY, TO HELPING

13:25.509 --> 13:26.774
MARKET DANGEROUS PRODUCTS, TO

13:26.843 --> 13:29.911
ENABLING AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES.

13:29.980 --> 13:30.912
AND, FORMER EMPLOYEES HAVE

13:30.981 --> 13:32.146
POINTED OUT THAT FOR ALL ITS

13:32.215 --> 13:33.281
TALK OF MAKING THE WORLD A

13:33.350 --> 13:34.682
BETTER PLACE, IT'S WORKED FOR

13:34.751 --> 13:36.417
SOME OF THE PLANET'S BIGGEST

13:36.486 --> 13:38.219
POLLUTERS, WHILE GETTING

13:38.288 --> 13:39.454
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

13:39.523 --> 13:41.022
IN RETURN.

13:41.091 --> 13:41.989
IN FACT, ONE OF THOSE

13:42.058 --> 13:43.191
DISILLUSIONED EMPLOYEES PAINTS A

13:43.260 --> 13:44.459
PRETTY DAMNING PORTRAIT OF WHAT

13:44.528 --> 13:46.627
THE COMPANY IS AT ITS CORE.

13:46.696 --> 13:49.730
>> THEY SERVE A LOT OF CLIENTS

13:49.799 --> 13:50.932
WITH REALLY HARMFUL EFFECTS.

13:51.001 --> 13:52.033
THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE

13:52.102 --> 13:53.668
REPERCUSSIONS ARE GOING TO BE

13:53.737 --> 13:54.268
AND THEN THEY SAY "WE'RE GOING

13:54.337 --> 13:55.870
TO DO IT ANYWAY."

13:55.939 --> 13:56.804
AND, THAT TELLS YOU ALL YOU NEED

13:56.873 --> 13:58.873
TO KNOW ABOUT THE FIRM.

13:58.942 --> 13:59.740
>> John: RIGHT, THAT'S AN

13:59.809 --> 14:01.109
INHERENTLY ALARMING THING TO

14:01.178 --> 14:02.844
HEAR ABOUT A BUSINESS.

14:02.913 --> 14:04.378
GENERALLY, YOU WANT COMPANIES TO

14:04.447 --> 14:05.780
MITIGATE HARM, NOT ACTIVELY SEEK

14:05.849 --> 14:07.148
IT OUT.

14:07.217 --> 14:08.583
IT'S WHY LEGO HAS A CHOKING

14:08.652 --> 14:10.184
HAZARD WARNING ON ITS PACKAGING,

14:10.253 --> 14:12.286
INSTEAD OF ONE THAT SAYS, "NOW

14:12.355 --> 14:14.288
WITH BLUE RASPBERRY FLAVOR!"

14:14.357 --> 14:15.523
SO IF IT'S THAT INFLUENTIAL,

14:15.592 --> 14:16.657
THAT UBIQUITOUS, AND IS BEHIND

14:16.726 --> 14:18.292
SO MUCH HARM, TONIGHT, LET'S

14:18.361 --> 14:20.461
TAKE A LOOK AT McKINSEY.

14:20.530 --> 14:21.729
AND, IF THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

14:21.798 --> 14:23.064
YOU'RE HEARING McKINSEY'S NAME

14:23.133 --> 14:25.266
-- DON'T BE EMBARRASSED.

14:25.335 --> 14:25.900
BECAUSE, FOR A COMPANY WITH SO

14:25.969 --> 14:27.268
MUCH REACH, IT'S GONE OUT OF ITS

14:27.337 --> 14:28.703
WAY TO TRY AND KEEP A LOW

14:28.772 --> 14:30.304
PROFILE.

14:30.373 --> 14:31.172
IT DOESN'T PUBLICIZE ITS CLIENT

14:31.241 --> 14:32.840
LIST, AND EVEN ITS OFFICES CAN

14:32.909 --> 14:35.143
BE HARD TO SPOT.

14:35.212 --> 14:36.177
>> WE STOPPED BY McKINSEY'S

14:36.246 --> 14:37.879
HEADQUARTERS AT 3 WORLD TRADE

14:37.948 --> 14:40.014
CENTER IN LOWER MANHATTAN.

14:40.083 --> 14:41.816
IT'S SUCH A POWERFUL COMPANY,

14:41.885 --> 14:42.784
AND YET YOU WOULD NEVER KNOW

14:42.853 --> 14:43.551
THEY WERE HERE.

14:43.620 --> 14:44.786
THERE'S NOT A SINGLE McKINSEY

14:44.855 --> 14:45.753
SIGN ANYWHERE.

14:45.822 --> 14:47.221
WHY IS THAT?

14:47.290 --> 14:48.289
>> THEY DON'T WANT ANYONE TO

14:48.358 --> 14:49.423
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THEM.

14:49.492 --> 14:50.892
THEY WANT EVERYTHING DONE IN

14:50.961 --> 14:52.160
SECRET, AND IF THAT INCLUDES

14:52.229 --> 14:55.363
WHERE THEY WORK, THEN SO BE IT.

14:55.432 --> 14:56.364
>> John: THAT'S NOT INNATELY

14:56.433 --> 14:58.566
SUSPICIOUS AT ALL!

14:58.635 --> 15:00.268
YOU'VE BUILT YOURSELF AN

15:00.337 --> 15:01.702
EXPENSIVE, GLASS-FRONTED

15:01.771 --> 15:02.970
NAMELESS LAIR THAT'S COMPLETELY

15:03.039 --> 15:06.340
INVISIBLE TO ANYONE, UNLESS THEY

15:06.409 --> 15:08.242
SIMPLY TYPE McKINSEY INTO

15:08.311 --> 15:09.010
"GOOGLE MAPS" OR HAPPENED TO

15:09.079 --> 15:10.478
HEAR THAT JOURNALIST SAY "3

15:10.547 --> 15:12.079
WORLD TRADE CENTER" WHILE SHE

15:12.148 --> 15:12.814
LITERALLY SHOWED YOU THEIR

15:12.883 --> 15:14.248
ADDRESS.

15:14.317 --> 15:16.217
KUDOS.

15:16.286 --> 15:17.985
THAT WAS A DICK MOVE AND I

15:18.054 --> 15:19.954
APPRECIATE IT.

15:20.023 --> 15:20.588
BUT, DISCRETION IS ONLY PART OF

15:20.657 --> 15:21.656
McKINSEY'S BRAND.

15:21.725 --> 15:22.190
THEY'VE ALSO CULTIVATED A

15:22.259 --> 15:23.524
REPUTATION FOR HIRING THE BEST

15:23.593 --> 15:24.859
AND BRIGHTEST, FRESH OUT OF

15:24.928 --> 15:26.894
ELITE COLLEGES AND MBA PROGRAMS.

15:26.963 --> 15:28.696
AND YOUNG, HIGH-ACHIEVING TYPES

15:28.765 --> 15:29.931
OFTEN USE A STINT AT McKINSEY AS

15:30.000 --> 15:31.799
A SPRINGBOARD TO BIGGER THINGS

15:31.868 --> 15:33.434
-- FORMER EMPLOYEES INCLUDE PETE

15:33.503 --> 15:35.403
BUTTIGIEG, SENATOR TOM COTTON,

15:35.472 --> 15:37.004
FACEBOOK'S SHERYL SANDBURG, AND

15:37.073 --> 15:39.407
GOOGLE'S CEO SUNDAR PICHAI.

15:39.476 --> 15:40.141
AND, McKINSEY PICKS ITS

15:40.210 --> 15:41.976
CONSULTANTS THROUGH A

15:42.045 --> 15:42.844
NOTORIOUSLY RIGOROUS INTERVIEW

15:42.913 --> 15:44.745
PROCESS, ASKING CANDIDATES

15:44.814 --> 15:45.213
CHALLENGING, SLIGHTLY

15:45.282 --> 15:47.815
UNCONVENTIONAL QUESTIONS.

15:47.884 --> 15:48.449
>> ONE OF THE INTERVIEW

15:48.518 --> 15:50.118
QUESTIONS I WAS ASKED IN MY

15:50.187 --> 15:50.751
FINAL ROUNDS WAS, "HOW MANY PIGS

15:50.820 --> 15:53.087
ARE IN CHINA?"

15:53.156 --> 15:53.721
WHICH SOUNDS LIKE A VERY SILLY

15:53.790 --> 15:55.022
QUESTION, BUT IT'S A REALLY GOOD

15:55.091 --> 15:55.623
QUESTION TO TEST HOW YOU THINK

15:55.692 --> 15:58.526
BECAUSE, IT'S NOT ONLY - THE

15:58.595 --> 15:59.961
ANSWER DOESN'T MATTER.

16:00.030 --> 16:00.561
IT'S, HOW CAN YOU STRUCTURE A

16:00.630 --> 16:02.563
PROBLEM?

16:02.632 --> 16:03.464
CAN YOU TAKE A VERY NEBULOUS

16:03.533 --> 16:05.666
SITUATION AND PUT STRUCTURE

16:05.735 --> 16:06.267
AROUND IT IN A WAY THAT MAKES

16:06.336 --> 16:08.336
SENSE, AND THEN LOGICALLY DEDUCE

16:08.405 --> 16:09.270
THINGS IN ORDER TO GET TO AN

16:09.339 --> 16:12.573
ANSWER THAT'S MEANINGFUL.

16:12.642 --> 16:13.207
>> John: SURE, THAT'S ONE WAY TO

16:13.276 --> 16:15.076
DESCRIBE IT.

16:15.145 --> 16:17.145
ANOTHER WAY MIGHT BE TO SAY THAT

16:17.214 --> 16:17.779
THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO SEE HOW

16:17.848 --> 16:19.213
GOOD YOU ARE AT BULLSHITTING

16:19.282 --> 16:20.414
YOUR WAY TO A PLAUSIBLE-SOUNDING

16:20.483 --> 16:21.983
ANSWER.

16:22.052 --> 16:22.984
BECAUSE, IF A BUSINESS "REALLY"

16:23.053 --> 16:24.051
NEEDS TO KNOW HOW MANY PIGS ARE

16:24.120 --> 16:25.486
IN CHINA, THERE ARE WAYS TO FIND

16:25.555 --> 16:27.155
THAT OUT.

16:27.224 --> 16:28.222
LIKE CALL CHINESE PORK MAGNATE

16:28.291 --> 16:30.258
QIN YINGLIN, OR JUST GOOGLE "HOW

16:30.327 --> 16:32.393
MANY PIGS IN CHINA."

16:32.462 --> 16:32.960
OR IF YOU'RE ON YOUR PHONE,

16:33.029 --> 16:35.463
GOOGLE "HOWKANY OIGSNCHINA,"

16:35.532 --> 16:36.764
BECAUSE THAT'S STILL ENOUGH FOR

16:36.833 --> 16:37.899
IT TO GO ON.

16:37.968 --> 16:38.800
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO, DRAW IT A

16:38.869 --> 16:39.567
MAP?

16:39.636 --> 16:40.802
I'M IN A HURRY.

16:40.871 --> 16:41.569
MY THUMBS ARE FAT AND I'VE GOT

16:41.638 --> 16:42.970
PLACES TO BE.

16:43.039 --> 16:43.771
BUT, ONCE THEY'RE HIRED,

16:43.840 --> 16:45.640
McKINSEY CONSULTANTS WORK

16:45.709 --> 16:46.707
INSANELY LONG HOURS, WHILE BEING

16:46.776 --> 16:48.009
SCHOOLED IN "THE McKINSEY WAY"

16:48.078 --> 16:49.844
OF DOING THINGS -- SOMETHING THE

16:49.913 --> 16:50.912
FIRM ITSELF CAN BE PRETTY

16:50.981 --> 16:53.381
INSUFFERABLE ABOUT.

16:53.450 --> 16:54.449
A PARTNER ONCE SAID, "WE DON'T

16:54.518 --> 16:55.716
LEARN FROM CLIENTS.

16:55.785 --> 16:56.384
THEIR STANDARDS AREN'T HIGH

16:56.453 --> 16:57.752
ENOUGH.

16:57.821 --> 16:58.953
WE LEARN FROM OTHER McKINSEY

16:59.022 --> 17:00.087
PARTNERS" -- A SENTENCE SO SMUG

17:00.156 --> 17:01.389
THAT, EVEN IF YOU JUST READ IT,

17:01.458 --> 17:02.290
YOU'D HAVE AUTOMATICALLY HEARD

17:02.359 --> 17:09.359
MY ACCENT IN YOUR HEAD.

17:10.233 --> 17:13.534
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT JUST SMUG:

17:13.603 --> 17:15.536
THAT IS BRITISH EMPIRE SMUG.

17:15.605 --> 17:16.170
AND THE THING IS, THAT LEVEL OF

17:16.239 --> 17:17.905
SWAGGER MIGHT MAKE SOME SENSE IF

17:17.974 --> 17:18.372
McKINSEY'S ADVICE WAS

17:18.441 --> 17:19.607
CONSISTENTLY NOVEL AND

17:19.676 --> 17:22.210
BRILLIANT.

17:22.279 --> 17:22.844
BUT, IT'S HAD SOME BIG MISSES --

17:22.913 --> 17:23.678
FAMOUSLY, IN THE EARLY 1980S,

17:23.747 --> 17:25.046
ITS CLIENT AT&T ASKED McKINSEY

17:25.115 --> 17:26.013
TO ESTIMATE HOW MANY CELL PHONES

17:26.082 --> 17:26.948
WOULD BE IN USE IN THE WORLD BY

17:27.017 --> 17:28.549
THE TURN OF THE CENTURY, AND

17:28.618 --> 17:29.117
McKINSEY CONCLUDED THAT THE

17:29.186 --> 17:30.485
TOTAL MARKET WOULD ONLY BE ABOUT

17:30.554 --> 17:31.786
900,000 PHONES, TOTAL, WHICH

17:31.855 --> 17:32.687
PERSUADED AT&T TO PULL OUT OF

17:32.756 --> 17:34.989
THE MARKET.

17:35.058 --> 17:36.557
AND, TO BE FAIR, McKINSEY WERE

17:36.626 --> 17:40.697
ONLY OFF BY ABOUT $739 MILLION,

17:44.100 --> 17:44.765
AND, TO BE FAIR, McKINSEY WERE

17:44.834 --> 17:45.733
ONLY OFF BY ABOUT 739 MILLION,

17:45.802 --> 17:50.071
OR 82,000%.

17:50.140 --> 17:50.538
BUT, EVEN WHEN THEY'RE

17:50.607 --> 17:51.539
TROUBLESHOOTING EXISTING

17:51.608 --> 17:53.341
PROBLEMS, THEIR "BESPOKE"

17:53.410 --> 17:53.908
SOLUTIONS CAN BE BLINDINGLY

17:53.977 --> 17:55.009
OBVIOUS.

17:55.078 --> 17:55.877
WATCH AS ONE McKINSEYITE BRAGS

17:55.946 --> 17:56.911
IN A PROMOTIONAL VIDEO ABOUT THE

17:56.980 --> 17:57.745
FIRM'S ABILITY TO COME UP WITH

17:57.814 --> 17:58.713
UNIQUE SOLUTIONS.

17:58.782 --> 17:59.280
>> WE WERE SERVING AN ENERGY

17:59.349 --> 18:00.982
CLIENT, AND THEIR PROBLEM WAS

18:01.051 --> 18:01.749
THAT THEY HAVE OFFSHORE DRILLING

18:01.818 --> 18:03.151
RIGS, AND THEY HAD STACKS AND

18:03.220 --> 18:04.619
STACKS OF PAPER INVOICES THAT

18:04.688 --> 18:06.721
THEY WOULD FLY OUT TO THESE RIGS

18:06.790 --> 18:07.989
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GULF COAST

18:08.058 --> 18:10.057
-- IN HURRICANE WEATHER -- TO

18:10.126 --> 18:10.825
HAVE TO GET SOMEBODY TO SIGN OFF

18:10.894 --> 18:12.593
AND THEN HELICOPTER BACK TO

18:12.662 --> 18:13.861
HEADQUARTERS.

18:13.930 --> 18:15.329
WE BROUGHT IN A TEAM THAT HAD

18:15.398 --> 18:16.731
PARTNERS WHO WERE EXPERTS IN THE

18:16.800 --> 18:18.399
ENERGY SECTOR, WE HAD PARTNERS

18:18.468 --> 18:19.467
WHO WERE EXPERTS IN PROCUREMENT

18:19.536 --> 18:21.702
AS A FUNCTION, AND THEY WERE

18:21.771 --> 18:22.837
ABLE TO GET TOGETHER WITH OUR

18:22.906 --> 18:24.105
DIGITAL TEAM, AND SAY "ACTUALLY,

18:24.174 --> 18:25.406
WE DON'T KNOW IF SIGNATURES ARE

18:25.475 --> 18:27.442
REALLY REQUIRED FOR THIS."

18:27.511 --> 18:31.279
>> John: YEAH, NO SHIT!

18:31.348 --> 18:32.046
I'M NOT SURE IT SPEAKS WELL OF

18:32.115 --> 18:34.515
YOU THAT YOU NEEDED THE DIGITAL

18:34.584 --> 18:35.349
TEAM AND EXPERTS IN THE ENERGY

18:35.418 --> 18:36.984
SECTOR AND "PROCUREMENT AS A

18:37.053 --> 18:38.085
FUNCTION," WHATEVER THE FUCK

18:38.154 --> 18:39.720
THAT MEANS, TO GET TO THE

18:39.789 --> 18:40.922
CONCLUSION "WHY NOT SEND AN

18:40.991 --> 18:42.256
EMAIL INSTEAD OF A FUCKING

18:42.325 --> 18:45.460
HELICOPTER?"

18:45.529 --> 18:47.061
AND THAT'S NOT A ONE-OFF -- OVER

18:47.130 --> 18:47.962
THE YEARS, THERE HAVE REPEATEDLY

18:48.031 --> 18:49.597
BEEN GRUMBLES THAT McKINSEY

18:49.666 --> 18:51.332
OVERSELLS ITS BRILLIANCE.

18:51.401 --> 18:51.999
IN THE WORDS OF ONE FORTUNE

18:52.068 --> 18:53.100
STORY, WHILE "SOME OF ITS WORK

18:53.169 --> 18:54.702
CAN BE HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED,

18:54.771 --> 18:56.604
MUCH OF THE TIME THE FIRM MERELY

18:56.673 --> 18:58.973
REORGANIZES SALES FORCES OR

18:59.042 --> 19:00.441
DESIGNS BY-THE-NUMBERS

19:00.510 --> 19:02.143
DOWNSIZING TO REDUCE OVERHEAD."

19:02.212 --> 19:03.911
AND, THOSE ARE JUST OBVIOUS,

19:03.980 --> 19:05.379
FIRST-THOUGHT IDEAS.

19:05.448 --> 19:06.948
ESSENTIALLY, McKINSEY IS A FIRM

19:07.017 --> 19:07.682
THAT PROJECTS A HUGE AMOUNT OF

19:07.751 --> 19:09.350
CONFIDENCE TO SELL A FREQUENTLY

19:09.419 --> 19:11.285
UNREMARKABLE PRODUCT AT SKY-HIGH

19:11.354 --> 19:13.387
PRICES, MAKING THEM TRULY THE

19:13.456 --> 19:15.756
SALT BAE OF COMPANIES.

19:15.825 --> 19:17.625
"YOU'VE HAD SALT BEFORE, BUT

19:17.694 --> 19:22.130
HAVE YOU HAD IT FROM A DOUCHE?"

19:22.199 --> 19:23.998
AND, LET'S TALK FOR A MINUTE

19:24.067 --> 19:25.399
ABOUT DOWNSIZING.

19:25.468 --> 19:26.267
BECAUSE, THERE IS A LONG HISTORY

19:26.336 --> 19:27.401
OF COMPANIES BRINGING IN

19:27.470 --> 19:29.036
CONSULTING FIRMS LIKE McKINSEY,

19:29.105 --> 19:30.471
AND VERY SOON AFTER,

19:30.540 --> 19:32.540
AGGRESSIVELY CUTTING COSTS.

19:32.609 --> 19:33.741
THIS GETS DRESSED UP WITH FANCY

19:33.810 --> 19:35.042
TERMS LIKE "FINDING

19:35.111 --> 19:35.643
EFFICIENCIES" AND

19:35.712 --> 19:37.278
"ORGANIZATIONAL STREAMLINING,"

19:37.347 --> 19:38.646
BUT WHAT THAT OFTEN AMOUNTS TO

19:38.715 --> 19:40.715
IS MASS LAYOFFS.

19:40.784 --> 19:42.183
AND LOOK: LAYOFFS ARE SOMETIMES

19:42.252 --> 19:43.518
NECESSARY, BUT THEY'RE ALWAYS

19:43.587 --> 19:45.219
PAINFUL -- AND MUCH MORE PAINFUL

19:45.288 --> 19:47.522
THAN SOME MID-20S IVY LEAGUER

19:47.591 --> 19:49.157
WHO FANCIES HIMSELF A BUSINESS

19:49.226 --> 19:50.458
GENIUS MIGHT REALIZE.

19:50.527 --> 19:51.626
24 YEARS AGO, McKINSEY ALLOWED A

19:51.695 --> 19:53.528
DOCUMENTARY CREW RARE ACCESS TO

19:53.597 --> 19:55.062
FILM A TRAINING SESSION FOR

19:55.131 --> 19:56.497
YOUNG CONSULTANTS, GOING THROUGH

19:56.566 --> 19:58.533
AN EXERCISE WHERE THEY

19:58.602 --> 19:59.167
ROLE-PLAYED ADVISING A REAL-LIFE

19:59.236 --> 20:00.601
CLIENT.

20:00.670 --> 20:01.869
HERE THEY ARE, JOKING ABOUT HOW

20:01.938 --> 20:03.237
THEY'D BREAK THE NEWS THAT

20:03.306 --> 20:04.071
LAYOFFS WERE GOING TO BE

20:04.140 --> 20:05.440
NECESSARY.

20:05.509 --> 20:05.973
>> WE'VE GOT A VERY SIMPLE

20:06.042 --> 20:07.575
STRATEGY.

20:07.644 --> 20:08.709
JUST -

20:08.778 --> 20:10.044
♪BOM, BOM, BOM, BOM BOM♪

20:10.113 --> 20:11.345
♪ BOM, BOM, BOM, BOM♪

20:11.414 --> 20:12.780
♪ HIT THE ROAD, JACK♪

20:12.849 --> 20:13.981
♪ AND DON'T YOU COME BACK♪

20:14.050 --> 20:14.615
♪ NO MORE, NO MORE, NO MORE, NO

20:14.684 --> 20:19.754

20:19.823 --> 20:21.589
♪ HIT THE ROAD, JACK♪

20:21.658 --> 20:22.190
♪ AND DON'T YOU COME BACK NO

20:22.259 --> 20:24.292
MORE, NO MORE♪

20:24.361 --> 20:25.827
THAT'S NOT OUR COMMUNICATIONS

20:25.896 --> 20:27.895
STRATEGY.

20:27.964 --> 20:29.430
>> John: COOL.

20:29.499 --> 20:30.298
NOW, I'M NOT A VIOLENT PERSON,

20:30.367 --> 20:31.098
BUT IF ALL THOSE DICKHEADS

20:31.167 --> 20:32.834
EXPLODED, I WOULD ABSOLUTELY

20:32.903 --> 20:33.734
SPIN AROUND SINGING "IT'S

20:33.803 --> 20:35.036
RAINING MEN."

20:35.105 --> 20:36.337
BUT, THAT'S EMBLEMATIC OF A

20:36.406 --> 20:37.805
MAJOR ROLE CONSULTANTS LIKE

20:37.874 --> 20:39.240
McKINSEY PLAY: ESSENTIALLY,

20:39.309 --> 20:40.975
ALLOWING EXECUTIVES TO SAY, "I

20:41.044 --> 20:42.643
KNOW JOB CUTS ARE BAD NEWS, BUT

20:42.712 --> 20:44.045
IT'S WHAT McKINSEY TOLD US TO

20:44.114 --> 20:45.847
DO.

20:45.916 --> 20:46.447
AS ONE BOOK ON THE COMPANY PUT

20:46.516 --> 20:48.349
IT, "THEY ARE, WITHOUT QUESTION,

20:48.418 --> 20:50.218
THE GO-TO CONSULTANTS FOR

20:50.287 --> 20:50.818
MANGERS SEEKING JUSTIFICATION

20:50.887 --> 20:52.620
FOR SAVAGE COST CUTTING, AS WELL

20:52.689 --> 20:54.122
AS A CONVENIENT SCAPEGOAT ON

20:54.191 --> 20:56.057
WHOM TO BLAME IT."

20:56.126 --> 20:56.858
THOUGH, THERE'S ONE AREA WHERE

20:56.927 --> 20:58.626
McKINSEY HAS HISTORICALLY

20:58.695 --> 20:59.927
ADVISED THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF

20:59.996 --> 21:01.229
COST-CUTTING, AND THAT'S

21:01.298 --> 21:02.830
EXECUTIVE PAY.

21:02.899 --> 21:04.098
STARTING IN 1950, A CONSULTANT

21:04.167 --> 21:05.800
OF THEIRS NAMED ARCH PATTON

21:05.869 --> 21:06.901
STARTED ADVISING CORPORATE

21:06.970 --> 21:08.569
LEADERS THEY WERE UNDERPAID --

21:08.638 --> 21:10.404
WRITING BOOKS LIKE, "MEN, MONEY

21:10.473 --> 21:11.639
AND MOTIVATION: EXECUTIVE

21:11.708 --> 21:14.675
COMPENSATION AS AN INSTRUMENT OF

21:14.744 --> 21:15.243
LEADERSHIP."

21:15.312 --> 21:17.044
HIS ADVICE WAS SO WILDLY POPULAR

21:17.113 --> 21:17.578
THAT, FOR A TIME, PATTON

21:17.647 --> 21:19.580
PERSONALLY ACCOUNTED FOR ALMOST

21:19.649 --> 21:22.450
10% OF THE FIRM'S BILLINGS, AND

21:22.519 --> 21:23.084
LATER CAME TO BE SEEN AS A MAJOR

21:23.153 --> 21:25.286
CONTRIBUTOR TO SKYROCKETING

21:25.355 --> 21:26.621
EXECUTIVE PAY.

21:26.690 --> 21:28.055
IN FACT, WHEN HE WAS ASKED IN

21:28.124 --> 21:30.958
THE '80S ABOUT HOW HE FELT ABOUT

21:31.027 --> 21:35.797
THE EFFECT OF HIS WORK, HIS

21:35.866 --> 21:37.765
REPLY WAS SIMPLE: "GUILTY."

21:37.834 --> 21:38.466
AND WHILE IT'S HARD TO GAUGE

21:38.535 --> 21:39.767
TONE FROM THAT, I'M GOING TO

21:39.836 --> 21:41.235
HOPE IT WAS A SOBER, REFLECTIVE

21:41.304 --> 21:42.236
"GUILTY," AND NOT -- AS SEEMS

21:42.305 --> 21:43.838
MORE LIKELY -- A NAUGHTY,

21:43.907 --> 21:45.339
MISCHIEVOUS "GUIL-TY!"

21:45.408 --> 21:46.707
LIKE YOU'D USE TO RESPOND TO

21:46.776 --> 21:47.608
"WHO SPIKED THE PUNCH?"

21:47.677 --> 21:49.277
SO, TO RECAP: McKINSEY'S ADVICE

21:49.346 --> 21:50.778
CAN BE EXPENSIVE BUT OBVIOUS,

21:50.847 --> 21:51.913
ITS PREDICTIONS CAN BE DEEPLY

21:51.982 --> 21:53.414
FLAWED, AND IT'S ARGUABLY HELPED

21:53.483 --> 21:54.782
SUPERCHARGE ECONOMIC INEQUALITY

21:54.851 --> 21:56.384
IN THIS COUNTRY.

21:56.453 --> 21:58.319
ALL OF WHICH IS PRETTY STRIKING,

21:58.388 --> 21:59.754
COMING FROM A COMPANY WHOSE

21:59.823 --> 22:00.855
LEADER YOU'VE ALREADY SEEN SUM

22:00.924 --> 22:01.856
UP ITS FUNDAMENTAL MISSION LIKE

22:01.925 --> 22:03.491
THIS.

22:03.560 --> 22:04.859
>> OUR PURPOSE IS TO CREATE

22:04.928 --> 22:05.726
POSITIVE, ENDURING CHANGE IN THE

22:05.795 --> 22:07.628
WORLD.

22:07.697 --> 22:09.597
>> John: YEAH, IS IT, THOUGH?

22:09.666 --> 22:10.932
BECAUSE, LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT.

22:11.001 --> 22:11.766
A QUICK LOOK AT McKINSEY'S

22:11.835 --> 22:13.234
CLIENT LIST SHOWS A BUNCH OF

22:13.303 --> 22:14.402
COMPANIES GOING OUT OF THEIR WAY

22:14.471 --> 22:14.969
TO DO THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF

22:15.038 --> 22:17.004
"POSITIVE ENDURING CHANGE."

22:17.073 --> 22:18.506
BECAUSE, IT'S NOT JUST THOSE OIL

22:18.575 --> 22:19.107
AND GAS COMPANIES I MENTIONED

22:19.176 --> 22:20.675
EARLIER.

22:20.744 --> 22:21.609
THE FIRM ALSO BEGAN COUNSELING

22:21.678 --> 22:23.344
THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY IN 1956,

22:23.413 --> 22:24.946
WELL AFTER WE KNEW SMOKING

22:25.015 --> 22:26.948
CAUSED CANCER.

22:27.017 --> 22:28.349
YOU MIGHT BE THINKING, "WELL,

22:28.418 --> 22:30.384
C'MON, IT WAS THE '50s, LOTS OF

22:30.453 --> 22:30.985
PEOPLE WERE OKAY WITH SMOKING

22:31.054 --> 22:32.320
BACK THEN."

22:32.389 --> 22:33.688
BUT, YOU SHOULD KNOW, McKINSEY

22:33.757 --> 22:34.922
ONLY "STOPPED" WORKING WITH

22:34.991 --> 22:37.558
TOBACCO COMPANIES IN 2021.

22:37.627 --> 22:38.192
WHICH IS, AND THIS IS TRUE, TOO

22:38.261 --> 22:40.761
LATE.

22:40.830 --> 22:41.662
THAT WOULD BE LIKE FINDING OUT

22:41.731 --> 22:43.698
SUBWAY DROPPED JARED'S CONTRACT

22:43.767 --> 22:45.399
"TODAY."

22:45.468 --> 22:46.367
WAIT: HE WAS STILL IN

22:46.436 --> 22:47.568
COMMERCIALS?

22:47.637 --> 22:49.137
FROM PRISON?

22:49.206 --> 22:49.771
HOW COULD ANYONE THINK THAT WAS

22:49.840 --> 22:53.174
OKAY?

22:53.243 --> 22:54.041
AND, IF YOU THINK THAT WAS

22:54.110 --> 22:55.476
DAMAGING, McKINSEY ALSO WORKED

22:55.545 --> 22:58.746
WITH PURDUE PHARMA.

22:58.815 --> 22:59.347
THEY ACTUALLY MADE NEARLY $84

22:59.416 --> 23:01.649
MILLION IN FEES FROM PURDUE, FOR

23:01.718 --> 23:02.884
ADVICE ON HOW TO, QUOTE,

23:02.953 --> 23:04.452
"TURBOCHARGE" SALES OF

23:04.521 --> 23:05.553
OXYCONTIN.

23:05.622 --> 23:06.120
IN FACT, LISTEN TO THE AG OF

23:06.189 --> 23:07.755
MASSACHUSETTS EXPLAIN JUST HOW

23:07.824 --> 23:09.023
INTIMATELY McKINSEY WAS INVOLVED

23:09.092 --> 23:10.458
IN PURDUE'S SALES PROCESS.

23:10.527 --> 23:11.793
>> McKINSEY CONSULTANTS ACTUALLY

23:11.862 --> 23:13.861
RODE ALONG WITH, WENT WITH

23:13.930 --> 23:15.730
PURDUE SALES REPS TO DOCTOR'S

23:15.799 --> 23:17.965
OFFICES HERE IN MASSACHUSETTS TO

23:18.034 --> 23:20.001
CRITIQUE THEM ON HOW EFFECTIVE

23:20.070 --> 23:23.070
THEY WERE AT SELLING OXYCONTIN.

23:23.139 --> 23:25.339
>> John: IT'S TRUE, THEY DID

23:25.408 --> 23:25.840
RIDE-ALONGS!

23:25.909 --> 23:26.641
AND HONESTLY, I DIDN'T THINK I

23:26.710 --> 23:28.342
COULD HAVE ANY SYMPATHY FOR

23:28.411 --> 23:30.478
PURDUE SALES REPS, UNTIL I

23:30.547 --> 23:31.179
LEARNED THAT THEY WERE TRAPPED

23:31.248 --> 23:32.180
IN A CAR WITH A McKINSEY

23:32.249 --> 23:33.948
CONSULTANT FOR HOURS.

23:34.017 --> 23:35.016
"YEAH, YOU MENTIONED YOU WENT TO

23:35.085 --> 23:37.351
HARVARD.

23:37.420 --> 23:38.786
CAN WE PLEASE JUST BE QUIET AND

23:38.855 --> 23:41.823
GO SELL SOME POISON?"

23:41.892 --> 23:42.957
BUT, IT'S NOT JUST PRIVATE

23:43.026 --> 23:44.292
COMPANIES -- REMEMBER,

23:44.361 --> 23:45.193
McKINSEY'S FREQUENTLY HIRED BY

23:45.262 --> 23:46.861
GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, TOO, WHERE,

23:46.930 --> 23:47.428
AGAIN, THEIR ADVICE HAS NOT

23:47.497 --> 23:48.229
BROUGHT UNIVERSALLY POSITIVE

23:48.298 --> 23:50.231
CHANGE.

23:50.300 --> 23:50.865
FOR INSTANCE, IN 2014, NEW YORK

23:50.934 --> 23:53.100
CITY BROUGHT McKINSEY IN TO

23:53.169 --> 23:54.469
FIGURE OUT HOW TO REDUCE

23:54.538 --> 23:56.838
VIOLENCE AT RIKERS -- A PROJECT

23:56.907 --> 23:58.239
WHOSE COST BALLOONED TO $27

23:58.308 --> 24:00.408
MILLION.

24:00.477 --> 24:02.443
PEOPLE ASKED QUESTIONS AT THE

24:02.512 --> 24:03.044
TIME ABOUT WHETHER THAT WAS A

24:03.113 --> 24:04.178
GOOD USE OF MONEY, BUT THE HEAD

24:04.247 --> 24:06.080
OF THE CITY'S CORRECTIONS BACK

24:06.149 --> 24:07.181
THEN INSISTED McKINSEY WAS WORTH

24:07.250 --> 24:09.083
EVERY PENNY.

24:09.152 --> 24:10.351
>> IF WE MADE ANY PROGRESS, IT

24:10.420 --> 24:12.086
WAS BECAUSE OF McKINSEY'S HELP

24:12.155 --> 24:14.522
IN AREAS THAT WE NEEDED HELP IN.

24:14.591 --> 24:15.056
>> John: WOW, THAT'S HIGH

24:15.125 --> 24:17.158
PRAISE!

24:17.227 --> 24:17.758
TO CLAIM THAT McKINSEY WAS THE

24:17.827 --> 24:19.994
"SOLE" REASON FOR ANY PROGRESS

24:20.063 --> 24:21.729
MADE AT RIKERS WOULD BE A PRETTY

24:21.798 --> 24:23.164
IMPRESSIVE COMPLIMENT, IF YOU

24:23.233 --> 24:24.432
DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE

24:24.501 --> 24:26.567
STATE OF RIKERS.

24:26.636 --> 24:28.503
SO, WHAT IMAGINATIVE STRATEGIES

24:28.572 --> 24:30.404
DID McKINSEY TRY TO IMPLEMENT?

24:30.473 --> 24:30.972
OH, I DUNNO, JUST FUN THINGS

24:31.041 --> 24:32.707
LIKE EXPANDING THE USE OF

24:32.776 --> 24:33.975
TASERS, SHOTGUNS, AND AGGRESSIVE

24:34.044 --> 24:35.476
DOGS.

24:35.545 --> 24:37.812
IT'S SOME "VERY" OUTSIDE THE BOX

24:37.881 --> 24:38.412
THINKING, FOR PEOPLE LITERALLY

24:38.481 --> 24:40.581
TRAPPED INSIDE BOXES.

24:40.650 --> 24:41.582
BUT, ITS BIG PROJECT WAS AN

24:41.651 --> 24:42.817
ANTI-VIOLENCE PROGRAM CALLED

24:42.886 --> 24:46.554
"RESTART."

24:46.623 --> 24:47.121
IT CLAIMED THAT VIOLENCE HAD

24:47.190 --> 24:48.156
DROPPED MORE THAN 50 PERCENT IN

24:48.225 --> 24:49.290
THE RESTART FACILITIES.

24:49.359 --> 24:49.824
WHICH SOUNDS GREAT!

24:49.893 --> 24:50.992
UNFORTUNATELY, IT TURNED OUT,

24:51.061 --> 24:52.527
THAT NUMBER WAS BOGUS, BECAUSE

24:52.596 --> 24:54.662
JAIL OFFICIALS AND McKINSEY

24:54.731 --> 24:55.630
CONSULTANTS HAD REPORTEDLY

24:55.699 --> 25:02.699
JOINTLY RIGGED THE RESTART

25:03.139 --> 25:03.805
PROGRAM, BY STACKING THE UNITS

25:03.874 --> 25:05.072
WITH INMATES THEY BELIEVED TO BE

25:05.141 --> 25:06.441
UNLIKELY TO GET INTO FIGHTS OR

25:06.510 --> 25:07.041
TO ATTACK STAFF IN THE FIRST

25:07.110 --> 25:08.042
PLACE.

25:08.111 --> 25:08.810
AND, WHILE McKINSEY, TO THIS

25:08.879 --> 25:10.144
DAY, DEFENDS THAT PROGRAM AND

25:10.213 --> 25:11.212
DENIES SKEWING THE RESULTS, IT'S

25:11.281 --> 25:12.914
NOTABLE THAT WHEN PROPUBLICA

25:12.983 --> 25:13.514
LATER CRUNCHED THE NUMBERS FOR

25:13.583 --> 25:15.016
RIKERS OVERALL, THEY FOUND THAT,

25:15.085 --> 25:16.484
JAILHOUSE VIOLENCE THERE HAD

25:16.553 --> 25:18.119
ACTUALLY RISEN NEARLY 50% SINCE

25:18.188 --> 25:20.021
McKINSEY BEGAN ITS ASSIGNMENT.

25:20.090 --> 25:20.822
AND HONESTLY: YOU'VE KIND OF GOT

25:20.891 --> 25:23.224
TO HAND IT TO THEM THERE.

25:23.293 --> 25:25.726
NOT MANY FIRMS COULD GET PAID

25:25.795 --> 25:28.996
$27 MILLION OF TAXPAYER MONEY TO

25:29.065 --> 25:31.766
LEAVE RIKERS SOMEHOW WORSE.

25:31.835 --> 25:33.067
AND, IT'S NOT JUST JAILS:

25:33.136 --> 25:34.635
McKINSEY'S GOVERNMENT CLIENTS

25:34.704 --> 25:37.004
ALSO INCLUDE REGULATORS.

25:37.073 --> 25:38.406
WHICH CAN GET A LITTLE WEIRD,

25:38.475 --> 25:39.040
WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT McKINSEY

25:39.109 --> 25:39.774
ALSO REPRESENTS CORPORATE

25:39.843 --> 25:41.442
CLIENTS.

25:41.511 --> 25:42.176
FOR INSTANCE: REMEMBER HOW IT

25:42.245 --> 25:43.978
WORKED WITH PURDUE PHARMA?

25:44.047 --> 25:45.179
WHILE IT WAS WORKING FOR THEM,

25:45.248 --> 25:46.948
IT WAS ALSO WORKING WITH THE

25:47.017 --> 25:48.616
FDA.

25:48.685 --> 25:49.417
THAT SURE SEEMS LIKE A CLEAR

25:49.486 --> 25:52.587
CONFLICT OF INTEREST.

25:52.656 --> 25:53.187
AND, IT WAS ONE THAT EVEN MR.

25:53.256 --> 25:54.822
"POSITIVE AND ENDURING CHANGE"

25:54.891 --> 25:56.457
HERE FOUND A LITTLE HARD TO

25:56.526 --> 25:57.058
EXPLAIN TO CONGRESS AFTER THE

25:57.127 --> 25:58.659
FACT.

25:58.728 --> 25:59.160
>> OKAY.

25:59.229 --> 26:00.561
SO, LET ME ASK YOU, DID YOU

26:00.630 --> 26:02.330
DISCLOSE TO THE FDA YOUR --

26:02.399 --> 26:04.499
McKINSEY'S WORK AT THE SAME TIME

26:04.568 --> 26:06.200
-- DID YOU DISCLOSE TO THE FDA

26:06.269 --> 26:07.969
THAT McKINSEY WAS WORKING AT THE

26:08.038 --> 26:09.170
SAME TIME IT WAS WORKING FOR THE

26:09.239 --> 26:10.271
FDA, THAT IT WAS WORKING FOR

26:10.340 --> 26:11.739
PURDUE?

26:11.808 --> 26:12.306
DID YOU DISCLOSE THAT TO THE

26:12.375 --> 26:15.276
FDA?

26:15.345 --> 26:16.577
>> WE MADE CLEAR IN MULTIPLE

26:16.646 --> 26:18.312
INSTANCES THAT THE INDIVIDUALS

26:18.381 --> 26:19.881
INVOLVED HAD EXPERIENCE IN BOTH

26:19.950 --> 26:21.749
PHARMACEUTICALS AND OPIOIDS.

26:21.818 --> 26:22.583
>> RECLAIMING MY TIME.

26:22.652 --> 26:23.351
MR. STERNFELS, THEY DIDN'T HAVE

26:23.420 --> 26:24.986
EXPERIENCE.

26:25.055 --> 26:26.954
THEY WERE THE IDENTICAL HUMANS

26:27.023 --> 26:28.556
WORKING FOR BOTH AT THE SAME

26:28.625 --> 26:30.925
TIME.

26:30.994 --> 26:32.026
>> John: EXACTLY, AND THERE'S A

26:32.095 --> 26:33.628
BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HAVING

26:33.697 --> 26:35.096
EXPERIENCE WORKING FOR BOTH, AND

26:35.165 --> 26:36.697
ACTIVELY WORKING FOR BOTH AT THE

26:36.766 --> 26:38.199
SAME TIME.

26:38.268 --> 26:38.866
IT'S THE SAME DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

26:38.935 --> 26:40.501
TELLING YOUR WIFE ABOUT YOUR

26:40.570 --> 26:41.235
EX-GIRLFRIEND, AND TELLING YOUR

26:41.304 --> 26:41.936
WIFE ABOUT YOUR CURRENT

26:42.005 --> 26:44.205
GIRLFRIEND.

26:44.274 --> 26:45.940
ONE IS DRAMATICALLY WORSE THAN

26:46.009 --> 26:48.176
THE OTHER.

26:48.245 --> 26:49.143
AND, KATIE PORTER WAS RIGHT --

26:49.212 --> 26:50.778
THERE WERE MULTIPLE INSTANCES OF

26:50.847 --> 26:52.013
McKINSEY CONSULTANTS WORKING FOR

26:52.082 --> 26:53.815
BOTH PURDUE AND THE FDA AT THE

26:53.884 --> 26:55.183
SAME TIME.

26:55.252 --> 26:56.717
AT ONE POINT, FOUR CONSULTANTS

26:56.786 --> 26:58.686
WORKING ON AN FDA CONTRACT TO

26:58.755 --> 26:59.987
ENHANCE DRUG SAFETY WERE

27:00.056 --> 27:01.722
SIMULTANEOUSLY WORKING FOR

27:01.791 --> 27:03.357
PURDUE, ON PROJECTS DESIGNED TO

27:03.426 --> 27:05.693
PERSUADE THE FDA OF THE SAFETY

27:05.762 --> 27:07.728
OF PURDUE'S PRODUCTS.

27:07.797 --> 27:09.263
ONE PROJECT EVEN HAD THEM

27:09.332 --> 27:10.998
WRITING SCRIPTS FOR PURDUE TO

27:11.067 --> 27:11.966
USE IN A MEETING WITH THE FDA,

27:12.035 --> 27:13.768
ON THE SAFETY OF PEDIATRIC

27:13.837 --> 27:15.636
OXYCONTIN.

27:15.705 --> 27:17.271
PEDIATRIC OXY!

27:17.340 --> 27:19.173
OXY FOR KIDS.

27:19.242 --> 27:20.341
Y'KNOW, JUST LIKE IN THAT

27:20.410 --> 27:22.410
EPISODE OF "DORA THE EXPLORER"

27:22.479 --> 27:23.744
WHEN BACKPACK IS GETTING A BIT

27:23.813 --> 27:25.580
TOO HEAVY AND BOOTS GIVES HER A

27:25.649 --> 27:26.147
LITTLE SOMETHING TO TAKE THE

27:26.216 --> 27:28.015
EDGE OFF.

27:28.084 --> 27:29.584
NOW, McKINSEY CLAIMS THERE WAS

27:29.653 --> 27:30.785
NO CONFLICT, AND THAT THE NATURE

27:30.854 --> 27:33.287
OF THEIR WORK FOR FDA AND PURDUE

27:33.356 --> 27:34.689
WAS DIFFERENT.

27:34.758 --> 27:36.290
WHICH IS HARD TO TAKE,

27:36.359 --> 27:37.725
CONSIDERING THEY SOLD THEMSELVES

27:37.794 --> 27:39.527
TO PURDUE AT THE TIME, WITH THE

27:39.596 --> 27:40.795
NOTION THAT THEY HAD SPECIAL

27:40.864 --> 27:42.430
INSIGHTS INTO THE FDA.

27:42.499 --> 27:44.732
THEY TOLD PURDUE IN 2014 THAT

27:44.801 --> 27:46.734
THEY BROUGHT AN "UNEQUALED

27:46.803 --> 27:48.703
CAPABILITY BASED ON WHO WE KNOW

27:48.772 --> 27:51.038
AND WHAT WE KNOW," INCLUDING

27:51.107 --> 27:53.207
"THE FDA, WHO WE HAVE SUPPORTED

27:53.276 --> 27:54.308
FOR OVER FIVE YEARS."

27:54.377 --> 27:57.512
SO, WHICH IS IT?

27:57.581 --> 27:58.613
WAS THE WORK YOU DID FOR THE FDA

27:58.682 --> 28:00.281
"TOTALLY DIFFERENT," OR DID IT

28:00.350 --> 28:01.883
HELP YOU BRING AN "UNEQUALED

28:01.952 --> 28:03.584
CAPABILITY" TO PURDUE?

28:03.653 --> 28:06.554
IT CAN'T BE BOTH.

28:06.623 --> 28:07.054
THIS ISN'T SCHRODINGER'S

28:07.123 --> 28:08.222
CONTRACT.

28:08.291 --> 28:09.190
YOU DON'T GET TO CLAIM IT'S BOTH

28:09.259 --> 28:10.892
RELEVANT AND UNRELATED DEPENDING

28:10.961 --> 28:12.126
ON WHO THE FUCK YOU'RE TALKING

28:12.195 --> 28:14.128
TO.

28:14.197 --> 28:15.296
AND AT THIS POINT, I COULD STOP.

28:15.365 --> 28:17.431
TOBACCO, OPIOIDS, RIKERS.

28:17.500 --> 28:18.833
THOSE ARE ALREADY SOME PRETTY

28:18.902 --> 28:19.867
UNPLEASANT STAINS ON A COMPANY'S

28:19.936 --> 28:22.637
RECORD.

28:22.706 --> 28:23.237
BUT, HERE'S THE THING: ALL THE

28:23.306 --> 28:24.806
EXAMPLES SO FAR ARE JUST FROM

28:24.875 --> 28:26.107
THE US.

28:26.176 --> 28:26.741
AND REMEMBER -- McKINSEY NOW HAS

28:26.810 --> 28:28.443
OFFICES ALL OVER THE WORLD.

28:28.512 --> 28:29.777
AND FROM THEM, THEY'VE COZIED UP

28:29.846 --> 28:31.946
TO SOME TRULY TERRIBLE CLIENTS.

28:32.015 --> 28:33.114
THEY'VE WORKED FOR A RUSSIAN

28:33.183 --> 28:34.682
DEFENSE CONTRACTOR, AND ARE SO

28:34.751 --> 28:35.750
DEEPLY ENTRENCHED IN THE

28:35.819 --> 28:37.652
GOVERNMENT OF SAUDI ARABIA THAT

28:37.721 --> 28:38.486
SAUDI ARABIA'S PLANNING MINISTRY

28:38.555 --> 28:39.487
HAS BEEN DUBBED "THE MINISTRY OF

28:39.556 --> 28:41.422
McKINSEY."

28:41.491 --> 28:43.825
AND, IT'LL LOUDLY DEFEND ITS

28:43.894 --> 28:44.725
WORK THERE, SAYING THAT IT FEELS

28:44.794 --> 28:46.027
IT'S MAKING THE COUNTRY A BETTER

28:46.096 --> 28:47.195
PLACE.

28:47.264 --> 28:47.695
BUT, THAT FEAT OF MENTAL

28:47.764 --> 28:49.564
GYMNASTICS GOT A LITTLE TRICKIER

28:49.633 --> 28:50.298
AFTER JAMAL KHASHOGGI WAS

28:50.367 --> 28:52.567
ASSASSINATED.

28:52.636 --> 28:53.201
JUST A FEW MONTHS LATER,

28:53.270 --> 28:54.268
McKINSEY'S HEAD AT THE TIME WAS

28:54.337 --> 28:55.970
ON CNBC, TRYING TO DEFEND ITS

28:56.039 --> 28:57.238
WORK IN THE COUNTRY, AND

28:57.307 --> 28:58.506
REASSURING EVERYONE IT HAD A

28:58.575 --> 29:00.975
STRICT MORAL CODE.

29:01.044 --> 29:01.809
>> THE WORK THAT WE DO -- AND WE

29:01.878 --> 29:03.177
THINK VERY HARD ABOUT THE WORK

29:03.246 --> 29:04.612
WE DO -- NEEDS TO BE WORK THAT

29:04.681 --> 29:06.447
DOES MAKE A POSITIVE DIFFERENCE.

29:06.516 --> 29:06.914
>> SURE.

29:06.983 --> 29:09.717
>> AND, THAT'S WHAT I'M --

29:09.786 --> 29:11.352
-- MAKING SURE WE --

29:11.421 --> 29:11.919
>> BUT JUST STRAIGHT UP AND

29:11.988 --> 29:13.187
DOWN, DOING BUSINESS WITH A

29:13.256 --> 29:14.489
MURDERER IS OKAY BY YOU?

29:14.558 --> 29:15.456
>> NO, IT'S ABSOLUTELY NOT.

29:15.525 --> 29:16.090
>> OKAY, AND YOU -- AND WHEN --

29:16.159 --> 29:17.258
WHEN YOU FIND OUT THAT YOUR

29:17.327 --> 29:17.859
CLIENT IS A MURDERER, YOU DO

29:17.928 --> 29:18.893
WHAT?

29:18.962 --> 29:19.494
>> YOU WALK.

29:19.563 --> 29:20.962
>> YOU WALK.

29:21.031 --> 29:22.730
>> John: OH, YOU WALK, DO YOU?

29:22.799 --> 29:23.131
THAT SOUNDS GOOD!

29:23.200 --> 29:24.031
EXCEPT HERE'S THE THING: THEY

29:24.100 --> 29:25.500
DIDN'T WALK.

29:25.569 --> 29:26.267
THEIR CLIENT KILLED AND

29:26.336 --> 29:27.635
DISMEMBERED A JOURNALIST, AND

29:27.704 --> 29:29.170
McKINSEY RESPONDED BY

29:29.239 --> 29:29.771
PARTICIPATING IN A MAJOR SAUDI

29:29.840 --> 29:31.105
INVESTMENT CONFERENCE THAT SAME

29:31.174 --> 29:33.074
MONTH, EVEN AS OTHER COMPANIES

29:33.143 --> 29:34.108
PULLED OUT.

29:34.177 --> 29:35.676
SO UNLESS "YOU WALK" IS SHORT

29:35.745 --> 29:37.211
FOR "YOU WALK TO THE FRONT OF

29:37.280 --> 29:38.379
THE LINE AND PICK UP YOUR

29:38.448 --> 29:39.947
LANYARD FOR ANOTHER FUN WEEKEND

29:40.016 --> 29:41.315
AT THE JOURNALIST-CHOPPIN'

29:41.384 --> 29:42.784
BUSINESS JAMBOREE," YOU ARE FULL

29:42.853 --> 29:44.585
OF SHIT!

29:44.654 --> 29:46.954
BUT WAIT -- IT GETS EVEN WORSE.

29:47.023 --> 29:48.489
BECAUSE IT LATER EMERGED THAT IN

29:48.558 --> 29:49.323
ONE OF McKINSEY'S REPORTS, IT

29:49.392 --> 29:50.892
HIGHLIGHTED THREE PEOPLE WHO

29:50.961 --> 29:52.326
"DROVE NEGATIVE CONVERSATION ON

29:52.395 --> 29:53.494
TWITTER" ABOUT SAUDI GOVERNMENT

29:53.563 --> 29:54.896
POLICIES.

29:54.965 --> 29:56.497
THIS IS THAT SLIDE -- FEATURING

29:56.566 --> 29:57.965
NAMES, PICTURES, CRITICISMS AND

29:58.034 --> 29:59.734
FOLLOWER COUNTS.

29:59.803 --> 30:00.735
AND SUBSEQUENTLY, SOME OF THOSE

30:00.804 --> 30:02.036
PEOPLE WERE -- YOU'RE NOT GONNA

30:02.105 --> 30:03.704
BELIEVE THIS -- TARGETED BY THE

30:03.773 --> 30:06.274
SAUDI GOVERNMENT.

30:06.343 --> 30:07.175
IN FACT, ONE OF THEIR PHONES WAS

30:07.244 --> 30:08.342
HACKED, REVEALING COMMUNICATIONS

30:08.411 --> 30:09.811
WITH, YOU GUESSED IT, JAMAL

30:09.880 --> 30:11.979
KHASHOGGI.

30:12.048 --> 30:19.048
AT THIS POINT, I HAVE TO TELL

30:19.990 --> 30:21.889
YOU McKINSEY CONSISTS

30:21.958 --> 30:22.824
"THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THE SLIDE

30:22.893 --> 30:23.825
DECK WAS CONNECTED TO THE DEATH

30:23.894 --> 30:24.525
OF JAMAL KHASHOGGI OR EXPOSED

30:24.594 --> 30:25.393
DISSIDENTS."

30:25.462 --> 30:26.027
AND, THAT IT WASN'T PREPARED FOR

30:26.096 --> 30:26.761
THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT.

30:26.830 --> 30:27.261
IN FACT, WHEN THIS STORY

30:27.330 --> 30:29.163
INITIALLY CAME TO LIGHT, THEY

30:29.232 --> 30:29.730
SAID THE REPORT'S INTENDED

30:29.799 --> 30:34.202
PRIMARY AUDIENCE WAS "INTERNAL,"

30:34.271 --> 30:34.836
AND THAT THEY WERE HORRIFIED BY

30:34.905 --> 30:36.137
THE POSSIBILITY, HOWEVER REMOTE,

30:36.206 --> 30:36.771
THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN MISUSED

30:36.840 --> 30:38.673
IN ANY WAY.

30:38.742 --> 30:40.208
BUT, COME ON.

30:40.277 --> 30:41.876
IT'S SAUDI ARABIA.

30:41.945 --> 30:43.611
EVEN IF THAT REPORT DIDN'T FALL

30:43.680 --> 30:45.379
INTO THEIR HANDS -- AND "PLEASE"

30:45.448 --> 30:47.115
-- WHAT PART OF THE WAY SAUDI

30:47.184 --> 30:48.883
ARABIA OPERATES MADE YOU THINK

30:48.952 --> 30:50.785
THAT "A McKINSEY-CURATED LIST OF

30:50.854 --> 30:52.453
SHIT-TALKING DISSIDENTS" WOULD

30:52.522 --> 30:54.088
BE A GOOD THING TO PUT TOGETHER?

30:54.157 --> 30:55.022
YOU'RE WORKING IN ONE OF THE

30:55.091 --> 30:56.924
ROOTINEST, TOOTINEST, JOURNALIST

30:56.993 --> 30:58.993
SHOOTINEST REGIMES IN THE MIDDLE

30:59.062 --> 31:01.195
EAST, AND YOU FIGURED IT WAS

31:01.264 --> 31:02.463
FINE TO DRAW UP A LIST LIKE

31:02.532 --> 31:03.998
THIS, BECAUSE THE POTENTIAL FOR

31:04.067 --> 31:05.600
MISUSE WAS "REMOTE?"

31:05.669 --> 31:07.368
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

31:07.437 --> 31:09.103
THIS IS A GOVERNMENT LED BY

31:09.172 --> 31:10.471
MOHAMMED BIN-SALMAN, A MAN WHO,

31:10.540 --> 31:11.906
AND THIS IS TRUE, ONCE DETAINED

31:11.975 --> 31:14.575
HIS OWN MOTHER.

31:14.644 --> 31:16.043
DO YOU THINK IF MBS WERE TO

31:16.112 --> 31:17.245
STUMBLE ACROSS A LIST OF HIS

31:17.314 --> 31:18.746
HATERS, HE'D JUST SEND THEM A

31:18.815 --> 31:20.181
BIG "NO HARD FEELINGS ABOUT ALL

31:20.250 --> 31:21.449
THE DISSIDENT STUFF" EDIBLE

31:21.518 --> 31:25.419
ARRANGEMENT?

31:25.488 --> 31:27.188
THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU?

31:27.257 --> 31:28.556
AND FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, A

31:28.625 --> 31:29.490
FORMER McKINSEY CONSULTANT HAS

31:29.559 --> 31:31.092
CALLED THAT WHOLE "INTERNAL

31:31.161 --> 31:32.627
DOCUMENT" EXCUSE "UTTER

31:32.696 --> 31:34.061
HORSESHIT."

31:34.130 --> 31:34.796
AND LOOK: McKINSEY WILL CLAIM

31:34.865 --> 31:36.531
THAT EVERYTHING I'VE MENTIONED

31:36.600 --> 31:37.899
TONIGHT ARE ISOLATED CASES, NOT

31:37.968 --> 31:38.833
REPRESENTATIVE OF THEIR WORK

31:38.902 --> 31:40.468
OVERALL.

31:40.537 --> 31:41.102
WHAT'S MORE, THEY'LL SAY THEY'VE

31:41.171 --> 31:42.637
REVAMPED THEIR POLICIES ON

31:42.706 --> 31:43.271
CLIENT SELECTION, AND THAT "IF A

31:43.340 --> 31:45.139
CLIENT OR PROPOSED PROJECT FALLS

31:45.208 --> 31:46.808
SHORT OF OUR STANDARDS, WE WILL

31:46.877 --> 31:48.075
NOT DO THE WORK."

31:48.144 --> 31:49.610
ALTHOUGH, THEY'RE STILL WORKING

31:49.679 --> 31:50.478
IN SAUDI ARABIA, SO THOSE

31:50.547 --> 31:51.612
STANDARDS SEEM, AT BEST, FUCKING

31:51.681 --> 31:54.449
FLEXIBLE.

31:54.518 --> 31:55.283
THEY ALSO WANT ME TO TELL YOU

31:55.352 --> 31:57.018
THEY DO A LOT OF PROJECTS LIKE

31:57.087 --> 31:58.686
HELPING CLIENTS DEPLOY VACCINES,

31:58.755 --> 32:00.421
OR SUPPORTING REFUGEES AND

32:00.490 --> 32:01.522
REBUILDING IN UKRAINE, WHICH IS

32:01.591 --> 32:03.157
VERY NICE.

32:03.226 --> 32:05.259
BUT, THINK OF IT LIKE THIS: HOW

32:05.328 --> 32:06.661
MANY UPLIFTING McKINSEY PROJECTS

32:06.730 --> 32:07.829
LIKE "MORE SNUGGLES AT THE PUPPY

32:07.898 --> 32:09.597
FACTORY" OR "MAKE GRANDMA LIVE

32:09.666 --> 32:11.299
FOREVER," WOULD YOU NEED TO HEAR

32:11.368 --> 32:12.667
ABOUT TO EFFECTIVELY

32:12.736 --> 32:13.901
COUNTERBALANCE "TURBOCHARGE THE

32:13.970 --> 32:15.970
OPIOID EPIDEMIC," "HELP FUCK UP

32:16.039 --> 32:18.506
RIKERS EVEN MORE," AND "MAKE A

32:18.575 --> 32:20.942
SAUDI ARABIAN SNITCH LIST?"

32:21.011 --> 32:23.644
AND LOOK, IT'S NOT JUST McKINSEY

32:23.713 --> 32:25.480
WITH THESE ISSUES: THEIR MAIN

32:25.549 --> 32:27.682
COMPETITORS HAVE HAD THEM TOO.

32:27.751 --> 32:28.416
BCG WAS ALSO DEEP IN WITH THE

32:28.485 --> 32:30.618
SAUDIS, AND BAIN WAS BANNED FROM

32:30.687 --> 32:31.686
STATE CONTRACTS IN SOUTH AFRICA

32:31.755 --> 32:36.390
FOR A DECADE, THANKS TO ITS ROLE

32:36.459 --> 32:37.158
IN A MASSIVE CORRUPTION SCANDAL.

32:37.227 --> 32:37.825
AND, I'M NOT EVEN SAYING THE

32:37.894 --> 32:39.260
CONSULTING INDUSTRY SHOULD BE
