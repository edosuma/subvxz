Well, let's look
at the facts.

03:01.733 --> 03:04.080
As video game sales
in America have spiked,

03:04.114 --> 03:07.014
violent crime has actually
gone down.

03:07.048 --> 03:08.843
And other countries
where games are popular

03:08.878 --> 03:10.949
have even lower
rates of violent crime.

03:10.983 --> 03:12.916
[speaking Japanese]

[Adam]
And despite
the lazy media narrative

03:21.649 --> 03:23.513
connecting mass shootings
to video games,

03:23.548 --> 03:25.584
multiple studies,
including an analysis

03:25.619 --> 03:27.034
by the Secret Service,

03:27.068 --> 03:28.277
have found that
school shooters

03:28.311 --> 03:30.520
actually consume significantly
lower amounts

03:30.555 --> 03:33.247
of violent media and video games
than their peers.

03:33.282 --> 03:34.973

03:48.020 --> 03:49.884
[Adam]
Well, some studies do show

03:49.919 --> 03:52.784
that violent video games
can cause a temporary increase

03:52.818 --> 03:54.786
in aggressive thoughts
and behavior.

03:54.820 --> 03:57.375
But those studies
are pretty flimsy.

03:57.409 --> 03:59.549
Because they didn't measure
anything the average person

03:59.584 --> 04:01.827
would actually
consider aggression.

04:01.862 --> 04:03.622
One study just measured
whether or not

04:03.657 --> 04:05.797
people who played
video games were more likely

04:05.831 --> 04:08.109
to feed their opponents
hot sauce.

04:08.144 --> 04:09.387
Hey!

04:09.421 --> 04:11.423
And even if these studies
had tested

04:11.458 --> 04:13.322
real-world acts of aggression,

04:13.356 --> 04:16.256
the change in behavior
they measured was tiny.

04:16.290 --> 04:18.327
Just 2% on average.

04:18.361 --> 04:19.983
Other studies have shown
a similar effect

04:58.159 --> 05:00.369
still scapegoat video games.

Parkland tragedy,

lazy narrative right back.

05:16.937 --> 05:18.559
After the Newtown
school shooting,

05:18.594 --> 05:22.080
it was widely reported that
the gunman played video games.

05:22.114 --> 05:24.634
But what they left out was
that his favorite game,

05:24.669 --> 05:27.465
the one he'd play
up to ten hours a day,

05:27.499 --> 05:29.708
was "Dance Dance Revolution."

05:29.743 --> 05:32.090
The fact is,
it's just easier to blame

05:32.124 --> 05:34.817
video games than to tackle
societal problems

05:34.851 --> 05:37.647

impact rates of violence.

and employment disparities,

mental health treatment,

of shootings,

08:33.374 --> 08:35.031
where everybody wins?

08:35.066 --> 08:38.069
Well, originally,
it wasn't just a game.

08:38.103 --> 08:39.657
What we know today
as Monopoly

08:39.691 --> 08:43.039
was invented in 1903
by a social activist

08:43.074 --> 08:44.558
named Lizzie Magie,

08:44.593 --> 08:46.526
who meant for it to be
a teaching tool

08:46.560 --> 08:48.838
about the evils
of capitalism.

08:48.873 --> 08:51.047
How can I make people realize

08:51.082 --> 08:53.084
that Carnegie
and Rockefeller

08:53.118 --> 08:55.120
are swimming in money

08:55.155 --> 08:57.260
while their workers
struggle?

08:57.295 --> 08:59.608
And that's a bad thing.

08:59.642 --> 09:01.851
Ah, a board game.

09:01.886 --> 09:04.889
Magie called her idea
The Landlord's Game,

09:04.923 --> 09:06.580
and it was meant to demonstrate
that while

09:06.615 --> 09:08.617
the winner-take-all
system of capitalism

09:08.651 --> 09:10.757
forces everyone to fight
against each other,

09:10.791 --> 09:12.690
when wealth
is equally distributed,

09:12.724 --> 09:14.312
all of society wins.

09:14.346 --> 09:16.245
And lots of people
loved it.

09:16.279 --> 09:18.385
Using a board game
as a teaching tool

09:18.419 --> 09:19.938
for economic justice?

09:19.973 --> 09:21.871
How keen.
Your turn.

09:21.906 --> 09:24.598
Sounds like a pretty
boring game to me.

09:24.633 --> 09:26.876
But I love a badass
female innovator

09:26.911 --> 09:28.706
as much as the next CEO.

09:28.740 --> 09:31.294
Go make bank off that
socialism, girl.

09:31.329 --> 09:34.159
Oh, even if she'd wanted
to make money off of it,

09:34.194 --> 09:35.782
she never had the chance.

09:35.816 --> 09:38.785
Magie's game was ripped off
by a destitute

09:38.819 --> 09:40.476
Depression-era deadbeat.

09:40.510 --> 09:43.272
His name was
Charles Darrow,

09:43.306 --> 09:44.514
and he was introduced

09:44.549 --> 09:46.275
to The Landlord's Game
at a party.

09:46.309 --> 09:48.829
He didn't think
anyone owned the idea,

09:48.864 --> 09:50.175
so he passed it off

09:50.210 --> 09:52.108
to Parker Brothers
as his own.

09:52.143 --> 09:53.627
Hey, Parker Bros.

09:53.662 --> 09:56.630
Check out this game I definitely
made up all by myself.

09:56.665 --> 09:58.943
It's called Monopoly.

09:58.977 --> 10:00.530
It's about making money,

10:00.565 --> 10:03.464
and it's gonna make us all
a ton of money.

10:03.499 --> 10:06.088
Oh, heck, yeah.
We're in.

10:06.122 --> 10:08.262
But then they discovered
that Lizzie Magie

10:08.297 --> 10:09.919
already had a patent.

10:09.954 --> 10:12.542
Hey, according
to the patent office,

10:12.577 --> 10:14.648
some lady came up
with this game.

10:14.683 --> 10:17.271
But don't worry.
That won't stop us.

10:17.306 --> 10:20.171
What?! I hope she sued
the pants off of them!

10:20.205 --> 10:22.035
And then I hoped they all
got slapped with

10:22.069 --> 10:24.554
HR violations
for being pants-less.

10:24.589 --> 10:26.349
She couldn't
and didn't.

10:26.384 --> 10:28.835
Parker Brothers
convinced her to sell

10:28.869 --> 10:31.769
them her patent for
just 500 bucks.

10:31.803 --> 10:34.634
Say, dame, what do you
say you let us

10:34.668 --> 10:36.290
make your
little game for you?

10:36.325 --> 10:38.327
And in exchange
for sharing,

10:38.361 --> 10:40.536
here's an amount
of money that's definitely

10:40.570 --> 10:42.365
not lowballing you.

10:42.400 --> 10:44.851
Oh, I don't care
about the money.

10:44.885 --> 10:47.198
I'm just happy more people
will learn

10:47.232 --> 10:49.994
how dreadful capitalism is.

10:50.028 --> 10:52.721
[Adam]
But Parker Brothers
only made a few copies

10:52.755 --> 10:54.550
of Magie's Landlord's Game.

10:54.584 --> 10:57.967
Instead, they mass-produced
Darrow's version,

10:58.002 --> 11:01.143
which only included
the monopolist rules.

11:01.177 --> 11:03.317
And when Monopoly took off,

11:03.352 --> 11:05.975
it made Charles Darrow
a millionaire.

11:06.010 --> 11:09.979
While Lizzie Magie never
saw a penny in royalties.

11:10.014 --> 11:11.256
Oh...

11:11.291 --> 11:12.741
And even worse,
Parker Brothers

11:12.775 --> 11:15.709
completely erased her name
from the game's history,

11:15.744 --> 11:18.091
giving full
credit to Darrow.

11:18.125 --> 11:20.334
Step right up to buy
America's

11:20.369 --> 11:22.440
favorite board game!

11:22.474 --> 11:24.407
It'll take you
from rags to riches

11:24.442 --> 11:27.341
just like its inventor,
Charles Darrow.

11:27.376 --> 11:28.826
Ironically,
what Darrow

11:28.860 --> 11:30.103
and Parker Brothers did

11:30.137 --> 11:32.174
actually proved Magie's
original point.

11:32.208 --> 11:34.901
Capitalism can be
a cutthroat competition

11:34.935 --> 11:36.281
where one person winning

11:36.316 --> 11:38.180
means someone else
has to lose.

11:38.214 --> 11:39.837
And maybe that's
something to think about

11:39.871 --> 11:41.631
the next time
you play Monopoly

11:41.666 --> 11:43.185
or do business.

11:43.219 --> 11:44.289
Bye-bye.

11:44.324 --> 11:46.119
Wait, you're gonna
leave me in here?

11:46.153 --> 11:47.707
Guys,
you still there?

11:47.741 --> 11:49.018
Can you hear me?!

11:49.053 --> 11:50.433
Help!

11:52.159 --> 11:54.058
Oh, great,
you're back.

11:54.092 --> 11:55.404
Don't care where
you've been.

11:55.438 --> 11:57.371
Let's just
cut straight to...

11:57.406 --> 12:00.374
the most sinister, vile,

12:00.409 --> 12:02.549
and destructive
game of all!

12:02.583 --> 12:04.033
That's an easy one.

12:04.068 --> 12:05.794
The Olympics.

12:05.828 --> 12:07.036
Really?!

12:07.071 --> 12:09.004
That's what you got
out of that?!

12:12.283 --> 12:14.112
[watch alarm beeping]

12:14.147 --> 12:15.458
Oh, my God!

12:15.493 --> 12:17.633
Oh my God, oh my God,
it's starting!

12:17.667 --> 12:19.048
[TV announcer]
Good morning to whoever

12:19.083 --> 12:21.050
is crazy enough to watch sports at 3:00 a.m.

12:21.085 --> 12:23.225
Today's women's
weightlifting finals

12:23.259 --> 12:26.159
will make or break dreams
of Olympic gold.

12:26.193 --> 12:28.402
Oh, there she is!
Go, Bethany!

12:28.437 --> 12:30.473
You're a winner just
by being here, girl.

12:30.508 --> 12:33.235
[chanting]
USA, USA!

12:33.269 --> 12:36.583
Actually, in the Olympics
almost everyone loses.

12:36.617 --> 12:38.309
Come on, I'll show you.

12:38.343 --> 12:40.276
Even though
the Olympics

12:40.311 --> 12:42.796
are a multibillion-dollar
industry,

12:42.831 --> 12:45.316
everyone from
the athletes to the cities

12:45.350 --> 12:47.939
that hosts the Games
gets screwed.

12:47.974 --> 12:49.976
This is so cool.

12:50.010 --> 12:51.805
But wait,
what do you mean?

12:51.840 --> 12:53.151
I mean, making it
to the Olympics

12:53.186 --> 12:54.428
is like
a dream come true.

12:54.463 --> 12:56.258
Yes, but to achieve
that dream

12:56.292 --> 12:59.157
many athletes
are living a nightmare.

12:59.192 --> 13:00.780
[Adam]
Even some medalists

13:00.814 --> 13:02.436
are unable to make ends meet

13:02.471 --> 13:04.922
and live close
to the poverty line.

13:04.956 --> 13:07.303
Tell us, what's
it really like to be

13:07.338 --> 13:09.271
an Olympic athlete?

13:09.305 --> 13:11.618
Uh, we often have to pay
for our own training,

13:11.652 --> 13:13.309
travel, and equipment.

13:13.344 --> 13:14.517
[panting]

13:14.552 --> 13:16.485
It costs... tons of money.

13:16.519 --> 13:20.178
Often tens of thousands
a year.

13:20.213 --> 13:21.835
[crowd cheering]

13:21.870 --> 13:23.872
Wow!
An incredible performance

13:23.906 --> 13:26.184
while speaking
an incredible truth.

13:26.219 --> 13:27.945
What are you gonna
do next?

13:27.979 --> 13:29.360
Oh...

13:29.394 --> 13:30.948
Sleep in my car,
I guess.

13:30.982 --> 13:32.639
I can't afford
to pay rent.

13:32.673 --> 13:34.123
Heartbreaking.

13:34.158 --> 13:35.676
Just like Ronda Rousey,

13:35.711 --> 13:37.955
who had to live in her car
even after she won

13:37.989 --> 13:40.889
a medal in judo in 2008.

13:40.923 --> 13:42.131
[woman]
Wait a minute.

13:42.166 --> 13:43.823
Olympics athletes
aren't paid?

13:43.857 --> 13:46.687
But millions of people
are watching them on TV.

13:46.722 --> 13:48.586
Well, they might get
some pay

13:48.620 --> 13:50.415
but hardly enough to live on.

13:50.450 --> 13:53.936
Sometimes their only
compensation is team swag.

13:55.213 --> 13:56.732
I can't eat this.

13:56.766 --> 13:59.321
Ugh, I guess
I could try.

13:59.355 --> 14:00.840
Okay, what about
Michael Phelps?

14:00.874 --> 14:02.324
He makes tons of money.

14:02.358 --> 14:04.498
Yeah, but most of that
sweet sports scratch

14:04.533 --> 14:06.155
comes from sponsorship,

14:06.190 --> 14:08.675
and only
the megastars can get those

14:08.709 --> 14:10.435
because the International
Olympic Committee

14:10.470 --> 14:12.437
bars anyone but
the biggest names

14:12.472 --> 14:14.923
from using phrases like
the "Olympics"

14:14.957 --> 14:17.995
or "Team USA"
to earn money.

14:18.029 --> 14:20.894
Hulko Puffs puff me up
for the [bleep].

14:20.929 --> 14:22.275
What the... ?

14:22.309 --> 14:23.552
For the [bleep].

14:23.586 --> 14:25.071
You know what?
Never mind.

14:26.727 --> 14:28.764
Okay, why don't their
teams just pay them?

14:28.798 --> 14:30.593
Because they'd rather
spend the money

14:30.628 --> 14:31.905
they get from the Olympics

14:31.940 --> 14:35.081
on overpaid coaches
and administrators.

14:35.115 --> 14:38.912
[Adam]
In 2016, the executive director
of U.S. Swimming

14:38.947 --> 14:42.295
made $854,000.

14:42.329 --> 14:46.920
But most of his swimmers
only made 5% of that.

14:46.955 --> 14:48.094
What?

14:48.128 --> 14:49.750
But the athletes
do all the work.

14:49.785 --> 14:51.614
[man]
Exactly.

14:51.649 --> 14:53.202
Sweet baby Costas!

14:53.237 --> 14:55.756
It's shot put gold medalist
Adam Nelson!

14:55.791 --> 14:58.069
Always a pleasure to meet
another Adam.

14:58.104 --> 14:59.588
So, tell us
what it feels like

14:59.622 --> 15:01.279
to be an Olympic
athlete.

15:01.314 --> 15:04.627
Sore mostly, but seriously,
it's a struggle.

15:04.662 --> 15:06.560
Athena, I was
the number-one-ranked

15:06.595 --> 15:09.080
shot putter in the world
for a number of years

15:09.115 --> 15:11.911
and my family still lived
competition to competition,

15:11.945 --> 15:14.154
oftentimes barely able
to get by.

15:14.189 --> 15:16.294
What?!
That is terrible.

15:16.329 --> 15:17.951
People idolize
you guys,

15:17.986 --> 15:19.815
and you didn't get
anything out of it?

15:19.849 --> 15:21.299
Well, don't
get me wrong.

15:21.334 --> 15:22.611
I love the Olympics Games

15:22.645 --> 15:24.233
and-- and the fans
that support it.

15:24.268 --> 15:27.236
But the bottom line is that
the IOC exploits the athletes.

15:27.271 --> 15:29.238
It's our work,
our dedication,

15:29.273 --> 15:31.758
and our competition that
allows the IOC

15:31.792 --> 15:33.484
to generate
billions of dollars

15:33.518 --> 15:34.830
in revenue every year,

15:34.864 --> 15:36.659
yet for some reason
it's the athletes

15:36.694 --> 15:38.523
that are still
struggling to make a living.

15:38.558 --> 15:39.973
That's why I've tried
to organize

15:40.008 --> 15:41.492
a Track & Field Athletes Union

15:41.526 --> 15:43.149
to empower
the voice of the athletes

15:43.183 --> 15:45.013
within the Olympic
movement.

15:45.047 --> 15:46.428
Now, if you'll excuse me,

15:46.462 --> 15:47.808
I've gotta
go find that shot put.

15:47.843 --> 15:49.949
They are not cheap.

15:49.983 --> 15:51.191
Man.

15:51.226 --> 15:53.124
I always thought that
Olympic athletes' lives

15:53.159 --> 15:54.470
were all Wheaties boxes

15:54.505 --> 15:55.989
and Olympic village
orgies.

15:56.024 --> 15:57.473
I'm afraid not.

15:57.508 --> 15:58.888
And if you think
the athletes

15:58.923 --> 16:00.097
are treated poorly,

16:00.131 --> 16:01.443
wait till you hear

and upgrades.

16:09.002 --> 16:12.109

almost always loses money.

all over the EU.

When local governments

17:01.882 --> 17:03.712
kicked out
under the guise of

17:03.746 --> 17:06.232
"cleaning up the city for
the global spotlight."

17:06.266 --> 17:07.854
Before the Rio Olympics,

17:07.888 --> 17:11.030
business leaders spent
$12.7 million

17:11.064 --> 17:12.341
on private security

17:12.376 --> 17:14.585
to force over a thousand
homeless people

17:14.619 --> 17:15.965
and young black men

17:16.000 --> 17:17.622
out of high-tourist
areas.

17:17.657 --> 17:21.868
For Seoul, almost
750,000 people were displaced.

17:21.902 --> 17:23.697
And in Beijing
an estimated

17:23.732 --> 17:26.528
1.5 million people

17:26.562 --> 17:28.357
were kicked out of their
homes to make room

17:28.392 --> 17:30.049
for Olympic construction.

17:30.083 --> 17:31.222
Oh, my God.

17:31.257 --> 17:33.121
All those people,
just for a game?

17:33.155 --> 17:34.363
Yeah.

17:34.398 --> 17:36.055
Which is why people
around the world

17:36.089 --> 17:37.573
have fought
against the Games

17:37.608 --> 17:38.919
coming to their city.

17:38.954 --> 17:40.093
[all chanting]
No Olympics here!

17:40.128 --> 17:41.129
No Olympics here!

17:41.163 --> 17:42.716
Organizers in Boston,
Budapest,

17:42.751 --> 17:44.097
Hamburg, and Rome

17:44.132 --> 17:46.272
have all successfully
lobbied their governments

17:46.306 --> 17:48.895
to drop bids to host
the 2024 Games.

17:48.929 --> 17:50.966
And in Los Angeles,
right now,

17:51.000 --> 17:53.210
activists are fighting
to try to get their mayor

17:53.244 --> 17:55.729
to pull out
of the 2028 Games.

17:55.764 --> 17:57.110
This is horrible.

17:57.145 --> 17:58.594
Why do we even do
the Olympics

17:58.629 --> 17:59.940
if it's this bad?

17:59.975 --> 18:01.597
Because the people
who organize them

18:01.632 --> 18:03.737
make too much money
to care.

18:03.772 --> 18:05.084
[Adam]
In the last Olympics,

18:05.118 --> 18:06.740
the International Olympic
Committee

18:06.775 --> 18:10.606
made over $3.5 billion
in TV rights

18:10.641 --> 18:13.299
and company partnerships.

18:13.333 --> 18:15.922
While businesses
and developers make billions

18:15.956 --> 18:19.408
building flashy new stadiums,
hotels, and high-rises.

18:19.443 --> 18:22.101
[cash register ringing,
crowd cheering]

18:22.135 --> 18:24.931
And of course,
the prestige of hosting

18:24.965 --> 18:26.795
the Games is a huge boost

18:26.829 --> 18:29.418
to the careers of ambitious
politicians.

18:29.453 --> 18:32.766
[cheering and applause]

18:32.801 --> 18:36.598
And the IOC encourages
and exploits all of this.

18:36.632 --> 18:39.773
Even going so far as
to accept bribes.

18:39.808 --> 18:41.430
So the people who run
the Olympics

18:41.465 --> 18:42.949
are making
all this money

18:42.983 --> 18:44.468
and everyone else
is getting screwed.

18:44.502 --> 18:46.608
Yup. Until those
who benefit

18:46.642 --> 18:48.782
use their power
to change the system,

18:48.817 --> 18:52.269
this is the true
Olympic spirit.

18:52.303 --> 18:53.960
Guess I'm going back
to watching football.

18:53.994 --> 18:55.272
Actually...

18:55.306 --> 18:56.480
Eh, never mind.

18:56.514 --> 18:57.688
You've had enough
for one day.

18:57.722 --> 18:59.724
Ah, I figured you
weren't coming back.

have no clue

19:06.662 --> 19:08.906
what's going on here?!

19:08.940 --> 19:10.287
Fine.

19:10.321 --> 19:13.566
This was supposed to be
a big reveal, but...

19:15.844 --> 19:17.811
I'm the devil!

19:17.846 --> 19:19.744
And I was doing this
whole thing more like,

19:19.779 --> 19:21.850
you know, if you didn't
win my games

19:21.884 --> 19:23.817
I was gonna steal
your soul, but, uh...

19:23.852 --> 19:25.060
doesn't really matter now

19:25.094 --> 19:27.062
because you didn't play
by the rules!

19:27.096 --> 19:29.547

your soul anyway!

19:33.275 --> 19:36.071
[laughing mockingly]

19:38.038 --> 19:40.213
Hey, Adam, thank you so much
for coming on the show.

19:40.248 --> 19:41.490
We really
appreciate it.

19:41.525 --> 19:42.664
It's a pleasure
to be here, Adam.

19:42.698 --> 19:44.942
Are you optimistic about
the chances for

19:44.976 --> 19:46.323
athletes in the Olympics

19:46.357 --> 19:48.256
organizing and-- and being
able to fight

19:48.290 --> 19:49.395
for better treatment?

19:49.429 --> 19:50.844
I am an eternal
optimist,

19:50.879 --> 19:53.088
which is why I think I was
pretty good as an athlete.

19:53.122 --> 19:54.607
I always believe
that there's

19:54.641 --> 19:56.919
something more to achieve,
and that we can achieve it.

19:56.954 --> 19:58.507
But in order
for that to happen,

19:58.542 --> 20:00.199
the athletes are gonna
have to bridge the gaps

20:00.233 --> 20:01.683
that exist between them

20:01.717 --> 20:03.961
and see that they
have this common bond.

20:03.995 --> 20:06.550
Unfortunately, they are
actually exploited.

20:06.584 --> 20:07.965
But the German athletes

20:07.999 --> 20:09.346
have done a good job
of organizing

20:09.380 --> 20:12.245
over the last year and a half
and earning recognition

20:12.280 --> 20:14.109
for their
independent athletes group.

20:14.143 --> 20:16.249
We in the U.S. have still
struggled to--

20:16.284 --> 20:17.630
to get to that point.

20:17.664 --> 20:19.148
And I'm optimistic
about it

20:19.183 --> 20:21.530
but I know it's always
gonna be an uphill battle.

20:21.565 --> 20:23.256
Well, for folks at home
who are hearing about

20:23.291 --> 20:25.120
this issue for
the first time

20:25.154 --> 20:26.604
and wanna support
the athletes

20:26.639 --> 20:28.123
but still, you know, love--

20:28.157 --> 20:29.711
love watching
the Olympics on TV,

20:29.745 --> 20:31.989
what can they do
to help the athletes

20:32.023 --> 20:33.232
fight for better
treatment?

20:33.266 --> 20:34.888
I don't have an answer
for that, Adam.

20:34.923 --> 20:36.890
[laughing]
That's fine.

20:36.925 --> 20:39.168
There isn't always something
that people at home can do.

20:39.203 --> 20:41.826
You know, I think everything
that the culture can do,

20:41.861 --> 20:43.311
everything that
the fans can do

20:43.345 --> 20:46.383
to empower athletes,
to recognize their value

20:46.417 --> 20:48.074
is gonna help.Right.

20:48.108 --> 20:50.076
And that's--
that's the big change
that has to happen

20:50.110 --> 20:51.560
is the athletes
have to understand

20:51.595 --> 20:54.391
what the value is that they're
actually giving up

20:54.425 --> 20:56.565
and then not
be afraid to say,

20:56.600 --> 20:58.429
"It's not un-American

20:58.464 --> 21:00.293
for me to ask
for what I'm worth."

21:00.328 --> 21:02.330
In fact, it's the exact
opposite.

21:02.364 --> 21:03.917
Right, that's a real

21:03.952 --> 21:05.264
foundational
American principle.

21:05.298 --> 21:07.300
That you-- you have value
and you should ask for,

21:07.335 --> 21:09.198
and you should
negotiate, damn it!

21:09.233 --> 21:11.028
Exactly, exactly.

21:11.062 --> 21:12.650
And a negotiation
doesn't involve you

21:12.685 --> 21:14.756
giving me a contract
that I can't change.

21:14.790 --> 21:16.102
Right.

21:16.136 --> 21:17.586
Well, I really appreciate
you being out there

21:17.621 --> 21:19.105
fighting for it, Adam,
and-- and thank you

21:19.139 --> 21:20.451
for coming on the show
to talk to us about it.

21:20.486 --> 21:23.937
Oh, thanks for
having me, guys.

21:23.972 --> 21:25.180
Read the contract.

21:25.214 --> 21:28.666
According to the rules,
your soul is mine.

21:28.701 --> 21:31.220
But I never agreed
to those rules.

21:31.255 --> 21:32.774
And games are
better for everyone

21:32.808 --> 21:35.432
when we all get to decide
what the rules are.

21:35.466 --> 21:36.881
Just like society.

21:36.916 --> 21:38.780
Hell isn't society.

21:38.814 --> 21:40.333
It's... hell.

21:40.368 --> 21:42.335
For instance,
we've ignored

21:42.370 --> 21:44.820
all the positive things that
video games can bring

21:44.855 --> 21:46.339
just 'cause a few people

21:46.374 --> 21:49.515
wanna make rules about
which games we get to play.

21:49.549 --> 21:50.861
You know, I somehow feel

21:50.895 --> 21:52.241
like you haven't been
listening to anything

21:52.276 --> 21:53.346
I've said
this entire time.

21:53.381 --> 21:55.728
And we never learned
Lizzie Magie's

21:55.762 --> 21:57.454
lesson about capitalism

21:57.488 --> 21:59.456
because Charles Darrow
and the Parker Brothers

21:59.490 --> 22:01.872
threw her rules
in the trash.

22:01.906 --> 22:04.012
I-- I-- I don't think
I even want your soul anymore.

22:04.046 --> 22:05.185
You're too annoying.

22:05.220 --> 22:07.533
And the Olympics
can't truly

22:07.567 --> 22:08.982
live up to their ideals

22:09.017 --> 22:11.053
of bringing people across
the world together

22:11.088 --> 22:13.228
if the rules
we use to govern them

22:13.262 --> 22:15.817
are so unfair
and destructive.

22:15.851 --> 22:18.337
Yeah, uh-huh.
Great. You done?

22:18.371 --> 22:20.166
Games are important.

22:20.200 --> 22:21.995
They're often how
we first learn

22:22.030 --> 22:23.480
to interact with others,

22:23.514 --> 22:26.483
and they're a reflection
of the world we live in.

22:26.517 --> 22:28.657
So, in games and real life,

22:28.692 --> 22:30.832
when we see that the rules
aren't working,

22:30.866 --> 22:32.489
we have to change them.

22:32.523 --> 22:34.180
Yeah, right!
Bye!

22:34.214 --> 22:36.113
[bell on door jingling]Oh, man.

22:36.147 --> 22:37.597
This was so much easier

22:37.632 --> 22:39.530
when I was just
selling cupcakes.

22:41.532 --> 22:43.189
[sighing]

22:43.223 --> 22:44.708
[laughing maniacally]

22:47.573 --> 22:49.575
Thank you for joining me.Thanks for having me.

22:49.609 --> 22:51.231
So, Maria, we just
talked in this episode

22:51.266 --> 22:53.579
about how the Olympics
negatively impacts
cities that host it.

22:53.613 --> 22:56.202
Your group, Strategic Actions
For A Just Economy,

22:56.236 --> 22:57.514
is working here in L.A.

22:57.548 --> 22:59.378
to try to mitigate
those negative effects.

22:59.412 --> 23:01.310
Absolutely.
That's exactly what I do.

23:01.345 --> 23:02.795
If you look at the Olympics

23:02.829 --> 23:05.798
that happened in London,
Sweden, Geneva,

23:05.832 --> 23:09.146
usually what you see
is rental prices increase

23:09.180 --> 23:10.872
between 30 to 40%.

23:10.906 --> 23:12.425
You have a developer
who says

23:12.460 --> 23:13.771
I can make
an apartment there,

23:13.806 --> 23:15.324
or I can make
a boutique hotel

23:15.359 --> 23:16.774
or a big luxury hotel

23:16.809 --> 23:18.431
that's gonna hold
all of the athletes

23:18.466 --> 23:20.468
that are gonna come and be
a part of the Olympics

23:20.502 --> 23:22.055
and they'll
try to get permits

23:22.090 --> 23:23.574
for hotel, restaurants
and whatnot.

23:23.609 --> 23:24.886
Evict everybody,
knock it down,

23:24.920 --> 23:26.301
build a hotel there.Absolutely.

23:26.335 --> 23:27.889
And then what you have
is these families

23:27.923 --> 23:29.408
who can afford
very little rent

23:29.442 --> 23:30.754
suddenly thrown out
into the street,

23:30.788 --> 23:33.619
where rents are between
$1,500 to $2,500.

23:33.653 --> 23:35.621
Oh, wow.So, often we see that
homelessness raise--

23:35.655 --> 23:38.451
rise two to three times
what they normally are.

23:38.486 --> 23:41.316
And in L.A. we wanna make sure
that that doesn't happen.

23:41.350 --> 23:42.800
What is your group doing

23:42.835 --> 23:45.354
and what can folks
at home do to,

23:45.389 --> 23:47.564
you know, push back
against this trend?

23:47.598 --> 23:49.566
Either in L.A.
of if the Olympics
comes to their city.

23:49.600 --> 23:50.912
Absolutely.
Some of the ways

23:50.946 --> 23:52.914
that people are countering that
is they're forming groups.

23:52.948 --> 23:54.433
For example,
here in Los Angeles

23:54.467 --> 23:55.813
we have a group NOlympics,

23:55.848 --> 23:57.608
and they're--
it's a consortium

23:57.643 --> 23:59.023
of different groups that
have come together

23:59.058 --> 24:01.612
to basically say
here is how the Olympics

24:01.647 --> 24:04.339
are gonna negatively
impact our society,

24:04.373 --> 24:05.823
our communities,
our homes,

24:05.858 --> 24:07.446
and we're not
going to take that.

24:07.480 --> 24:09.965
They write letters,
they stage rallies,

24:10.000 --> 24:11.760
they go to decision-makers

24:11.795 --> 24:14.038
and they let them know
exactly what their worries are

24:14.073 --> 24:16.593
and what they would like to see
in place of the Olympics.

24:16.627 --> 24:18.284
That's democracy
in action.

24:18.318 --> 24:19.596
To take that action...Absolutely.

24:19.630 --> 24:20.873
...and lobby
the government directly,

24:20.907 --> 24:22.357
as citizens.Absolutely.

24:22.391 --> 24:24.048
You cannot wait for
the answers

24:24.083 --> 24:25.498
to be written for you.

24:25.533 --> 24:27.673
You have to take part
in a democracy.

24:27.707 --> 24:29.295
It's a full-contact sport.

24:29.329 --> 24:30.710
Well, thank you
so much for doing it.

24:30.745 --> 24:32.747
Thank you so much
for coming on the show
and talk to us about it.
