WEBVTT

00:06.668 --> 00:08.601
Oh, hey, Donna,

00:08.669 --> 00:12.438
about this little celibacy kick we're on,

00:12.506 --> 00:15.607
does that cover quickies,
'cause I could be really quick?

00:15.675 --> 00:19.534
Well, that's why I call you "the flash."

00:19.602 --> 00:23.294
That's why you call me the flash?

00:23.362 --> 00:25.894
I thought it was 'cause I was flashy,

00:25.962 --> 00:27.853
like an entertainer.

00:27.921 --> 00:29.576
Come on, one little one.

00:29.643 --> 00:32.097
You can even watch tv.

00:32.164 --> 00:34.955
Eric, we agreed to hold
off until the wedding.

00:35.022 --> 00:36.337
It's cleansing.

00:36.405 --> 00:38.352
No, Donna, giving up
cigarettes is cleansing.

00:38.420 --> 00:41.066
Giving up sex is reckless
and irresponsible,

00:41.134 --> 00:44.957
and I think it might cause cancer.

00:45.025 --> 00:48.043
Hey, Jackie, I know since you moved in,

00:48.110 --> 00:50.120
we agreed to give each other messages

00:50.121 --> 00:52.535
as soon as possible, and
in the spirit of that,

00:52.603 --> 00:54.578
your mom called last Tuesday.

00:54.645 --> 00:57.757
What? No, she couldn't
call. She's in mexico.

00:57.828 --> 01:00.036
They don't have phones there.

01:00.103 --> 01:02.077
Uh, yeah, they do.

01:02.145 --> 01:04.887
Why would we give them phones?

01:06.259 --> 01:08.699
My dad tried to get back
in touch with me once.

01:08.767 --> 01:11.175
Instead of calling, he just
left a six-pack on my car.

01:11.243 --> 01:12.746
How'd you know it was him?

01:12.816 --> 01:15.722
He was passed out on the hood.

01:15.790 --> 01:17.964
Well, I don't have
anything to say to my mom.

01:18.032 --> 01:20.337
She ditched me three months ago,
and that's all I need to know.

01:20.405 --> 01:23.046
Oh, man, that's really sad.

01:23.113 --> 01:26.188
It's like a mother and daughter divided.

01:26.255 --> 01:29.329
So, hey, what about
some second base action?

01:29.397 --> 01:32.338
What did I tell you about
talking about the bases, flash?

01:35.013 --> 01:35.948
Donna.

01:36.015 --> 01:38.286
He doesn't know why.

01:38.354 --> 01:40.292
Jackie, you should cut your mom a break.

01:40.360 --> 01:41.996
I think she's charming.

01:42.064 --> 01:43.499
If she calls again,

01:43.567 --> 01:45.104
just tell her I don't want to see her.

01:45.172 --> 01:48.645
Well, that's too bad
'cause I just picked her up

01:48.712 --> 01:50.783
from the airport.

01:50.850 --> 01:53.891
And here I am.

01:53.959 --> 01:55.427
Mom!

01:55.495 --> 01:57.432
Oh, I love making an entrance.

01:57.500 --> 01:59.070
Be a dear and go watch my luggage.

01:59.137 --> 02:01.474
Really? Thanks.

02:01.542 --> 02:03.412
What are you doing here? Who cares?

02:03.480 --> 02:05.750
Welcome to my driveway, pretty lady.

02:05.818 --> 02:09.525
I'm Eric Forman. Remember me? Big fan.

02:09.592 --> 02:11.529
Oh, right, my toy poodle
snowball almost killed you

02:11.597 --> 02:13.166
when you were 6.

02:13.234 --> 02:15.737
I was 13, but, yeah.

02:15.805 --> 02:19.311
Mrs. Burkhart, Steven
Hyde. Nice to see you again.

02:19.379 --> 02:21.315
Just thought I'd let you
know that Jackie and I

02:21.383 --> 02:22.685
are kind of dating now.

02:22.753 --> 02:25.058
Didn't you rob our house?

02:25.125 --> 02:27.829
Well, I was in there a few times at night,

02:27.897 --> 02:30.401
but I never took anything.

02:30.469 --> 02:31.971
Mrs. Burkhart!

02:32.039 --> 02:35.911
I thought I saw gorgeous, flowing hair

02:35.980 --> 02:37.982
on bronze shoulders,

02:38.050 --> 02:40.687
And I wasn't near a mirror,
so I knew it had to be you.

02:47.654 --> 02:50.158
Mom, why are you back?

02:50.226 --> 02:52.930
It got rainy in Cabo,
so I hopped on a plane.

02:52.998 --> 02:55.701
Wish I was a plane.

02:58.674 --> 03:02.079
Then she could hop on me.

03:03.647 --> 03:04.816
And by hop on me, I mean...

03:04.817 --> 03:06.719
Yeah, yeah, we got it, Fez.

03:06.787 --> 03:08.123
Wait, let me guess.

03:08.391 --> 03:10.994
"rainy in Cabo" is Spanish

03:11.062 --> 03:13.833
for "my rich pilot
boyfriend ran out of money."

03:13.900 --> 03:16.336
Don't be silly. I don't know any Spanish,

03:16.404 --> 03:21.078
Except for gracias amas tequila.

03:21.145 --> 03:22.647
I just missed you.

03:22.715 --> 03:26.186
Well, I didn't miss you.

03:26.254 --> 03:29.191
And there's the stomp and cry.

03:29.259 --> 03:30.861
See you guys tomorrow.

03:32.828 --> 03:35.134
Miss Burkhart, I know
you and Jackie are working

03:35.502 --> 03:40.008
through some difficult stuff,
but may I just say, nice tan?

03:41.578 --> 03:43.647
Yeah, it really makes everything pop.

03:43.715 --> 03:46.986
Yeah, I'm popping a little right now.

04:29.056 --> 04:30.791
Why don't we ever have tea?

04:30.792 --> 04:32.693
Well, this sounds like the beginning

04:32.760 --> 04:34.961
of a wonderful argument...

04:35.029 --> 04:39.265
Like the stuffing versus
mashed potatoes fight

04:39.333 --> 04:42.568
that turned into why don't
I ever take you on vacation.

04:42.635 --> 04:45.237
Why don't you ever take me on vacation?

04:45.304 --> 04:46.804
Oh, crap.

04:46.872 --> 04:51.475
Oh, Mr. And Mrs. Forman,
I don't know what to do.

04:51.543 --> 04:55.778
Not this again. Kitty, make it stop.

04:55.846 --> 04:59.014
Now be nice, Red. Her
mom finally came home

04:59.082 --> 05:02.317
from her cultural tour
of Mexico's many fine bars

05:02.385 --> 05:04.719
and cantinas.

05:04.787 --> 05:07.288
Why did she have to go
all the way to Mexico

05:07.355 --> 05:08.655
to drink all day?

05:08.723 --> 05:10.390
Why couldn't she be a good mom

05:10.458 --> 05:12.358
and just do it at home like you do?

05:12.426 --> 05:15.661
Well, that's a good question.

05:15.729 --> 05:19.364
And you need to sit down
and talk to her about it.

05:19.432 --> 05:22.367
You can do it here with tea.

05:22.435 --> 05:24.569
We'll have tea!

05:24.636 --> 05:26.203
No!

05:26.271 --> 05:29.039
Why does this always happen here?

05:29.107 --> 05:30.540
We're in a recession.

05:30.608 --> 05:32.541
There are vacant lots all over the place.

05:32.609 --> 05:35.210
Well, you can go stand in a vacant lot.

05:35.278 --> 05:39.313
We're having a tea party with crumpets.

05:39.381 --> 05:41.315
I'll find out what they are,

05:41.383 --> 05:42.749
and we will have them.

05:42.817 --> 05:44.851
Okay, but I don't know

05:44.919 --> 05:46.886
if I can look my mom in the eye.

05:46.954 --> 05:48.888
I mean, I never thought I'd say this,

05:48.956 --> 05:51.257
but there comes a point
when a person is too tan.

05:55.761 --> 05:57.795
Whoa, check out this new police academy

05:57.863 --> 05:59.063
they're sending me to in waukegan.

05:59.131 --> 06:00.498
It's got its own pool!

06:00.565 --> 06:02.633
Oh, man, if I'd have known
it was gonna be this nice,

06:02.701 --> 06:05.835
I'd have burned down
the old one a lot sooner.

06:05.903 --> 06:07.904
Kelso, I'm really going to miss you.

06:07.972 --> 06:11.407
Who's gonna take my
lunch money and tease me

06:11.475 --> 06:14.910
and pull down my pants in front of girls?

06:14.977 --> 06:18.346
I'll be taking over.

06:18.414 --> 06:20.514
Hey, you're still gonna
drive me up there, right?

06:20.582 --> 06:23.049
Oh, man, Jackie's got this
heavy thing with her mom.

06:23.117 --> 06:25.551
I know she's gonna wanna
talk about it a lot.

06:25.619 --> 06:28.020
So, yeah, I'll drive you.

06:28.088 --> 06:31.022
Hey, since Donna cut me
off, I took the money that

06:31.090 --> 06:33.257
I would have spent on a
romantic dinner for two

06:33.325 --> 06:36.260
and bought me a gross of bottle rockets.

06:36.328 --> 06:38.996
Take that, Pinciotti!

06:39.063 --> 06:41.331
Bottle rockets, all right.

06:41.399 --> 06:43.466
Fez, start running.

06:43.534 --> 06:45.468
No, wait. I got a better idea.

06:45.535 --> 06:47.436
After we drop him off,

06:47.504 --> 06:49.438
let's stop off at the dairy farm,

06:49.505 --> 06:51.439
scare the hell out of some cows.

06:51.507 --> 06:53.841
Ooh, I love cows.

06:53.909 --> 06:58.178
They're the one animal
I can run faster than.

06:58.246 --> 07:00.246
No, no, let's go before you drop me off.

07:00.314 --> 07:03.449
That big spotted one needs
an attitude adjustment.

07:03.517 --> 07:05.517
No, man, it's got to be at night.

07:05.585 --> 07:07.519
Look, I've launched so
much stuff at those cows

07:07.587 --> 07:10.755
during the day, I swear,
they recognize my car.

07:10.823 --> 07:14.158
I can't believe you guys
are going without me.

07:14.226 --> 07:17.295
Those cows will never know what hit them.

07:17.362 --> 07:19.663
And even after it hits them,

07:19.731 --> 07:23.299
they still won't know,

07:23.366 --> 07:26.468
because they're cows.

07:32.540 --> 07:37.143
Okay, here, Red, try this tea.

07:37.211 --> 07:40.045
It'll make you feel british.

07:40.113 --> 07:42.980
mum's the word, governor.

07:43.048 --> 07:45.215
Kitty, this is America.

07:45.283 --> 07:47.618
We bomb countries that drink tea.

07:47.686 --> 07:49.153
Well, that's because

07:49.220 --> 07:51.154
coffee keeps us awake all night,

07:51.222 --> 07:53.122
and we wake up in such a bad mood,

07:53.190 --> 07:54.490
we have to bomb someone.

07:56.226 --> 07:58.126
Ooh, ooh, I bet that's Jackie's mom.

07:58.194 --> 08:00.428
I still don't think we
should get involved in this.

08:00.495 --> 08:03.063
As far as I'm concerned,
this is between Jackie

08:03.130 --> 08:05.198
and her ditzy lush of a mom.

08:05.265 --> 08:08.800
Hi. You must be Red. I'm Pam Burkhart.

08:08.867 --> 08:11.803
It's Pam.

08:13.140 --> 08:16.876
You made tea. Oh, I love tea.

08:16.943 --> 08:19.077
So do I.

08:19.145 --> 08:23.314
Wipe your chin, honey. You got some drool.

08:23.382 --> 08:25.316
Thank you both so much for doing this.

08:25.384 --> 08:27.317
You know, when you are
as beautiful as I am,

08:27.385 --> 08:29.352
it's hard to know who
your real friends are.

08:29.420 --> 08:32.255
Oh, I'm sorry that you
have to go through that.

08:32.323 --> 08:34.357
I'm just hoping that Jackie and I

08:34.424 --> 08:37.025
figure out a way to get along.

08:37.092 --> 08:39.861
Well, you've got your low-cut,
getting-along sweater on,

08:39.929 --> 08:41.395
so...

08:41.462 --> 08:44.030
I bet that'll help.

08:44.099 --> 08:45.465
Hi, honey.

08:45.533 --> 08:47.033
Hi.

08:47.101 --> 08:49.969
And by "hi," I mean, not hi,
because I'm not talking to you,

08:50.037 --> 08:51.471
even though I'm talking now.

08:51.539 --> 08:54.173
So I'm just gonna stop
talking, starting now.

08:54.241 --> 08:57.343
Oh! Dang it. Starting now.

08:57.410 --> 08:59.645
And now.

08:59.712 --> 09:01.480
This is awkward.

09:01.547 --> 09:03.981
Why don't I tell a story
about something charming

09:04.049 --> 09:05.483
I did in Mexico?

09:05.550 --> 09:08.552
I'd love to hear it.

09:08.620 --> 09:10.554
There was this woman
on a beach in cozumel.

09:10.621 --> 09:12.555
and normally, I wouldn't talk to someone

09:12.623 --> 09:15.558
who had such bad skin, but she was selling

09:15.625 --> 09:18.126
the cutest hair clips, so here.

09:18.194 --> 09:20.695
You know, I'd tell you
that doesn't fix anything,

09:20.763 --> 09:22.663
but I'm not talking to you. Oh, shoot!

09:22.731 --> 09:25.766
Starting now!

09:25.833 --> 09:29.469
Yeah, nice try, Mrs. Burkhart.

09:29.537 --> 09:31.370
Damn, these are cute.

09:31.438 --> 09:33.539
Look, Jackie, when your
father got into trouble,

09:33.607 --> 09:35.173
I panicked,

09:35.241 --> 09:37.642
but that doesn't mean I
stopped caring about you.

09:37.710 --> 09:39.544
Jackie, if you seriously don't want these,

09:39.612 --> 09:41.546
can I have them?

09:41.613 --> 09:43.947
Look, mom, a good time to
tell me you cared about me

09:44.015 --> 09:45.949
was the day daddy went to prison,

09:46.017 --> 09:47.984
not two months later on a postcard

09:48.052 --> 09:50.819
from la Cantina Cucaracha in Guadalajara.

09:50.887 --> 09:54.356
Isn't it nice to get postcards?

09:54.424 --> 09:57.392
Okay, fine. Jackie, look,
I know that you've got

09:57.393 --> 09:58.893
hostile feelings towards me,

09:58.894 --> 10:01.061
but I'm your mother, and I love you.

10:01.129 --> 10:04.964
And I promise I'll never leave you again.

10:05.032 --> 10:06.399
I believe her.

10:06.467 --> 10:07.867
Me, too.

10:15.841 --> 10:19.143
Kelso, you leave for the
police academy tomorrow.

10:19.211 --> 10:21.345
Shouldn't you be packing
gasoline and matches

10:21.412 --> 10:23.413
so you can burn that one down, too?

10:23.481 --> 10:26.249
I don't need gasoline to burn stuff down.

10:26.317 --> 10:29.518
All I need is these two hands
and a lack of adult supervision.

10:29.586 --> 10:32.287
Anyway, I'm not going.

10:32.355 --> 10:35.189
I decided I didn't want to be a cop.

10:35.257 --> 10:37.024
But, Kelso, I thought

10:37.092 --> 10:39.026
you wanted to impress
the mother of your child

10:39.094 --> 10:41.027
and give your life a purpose

10:41.095 --> 10:44.597
and pull over girls
for speeding while foxy.

10:44.665 --> 10:46.799
No, I got my reasons.

10:46.867 --> 10:49.668
I mean, I don't want to leave
when things are going so good

10:49.736 --> 10:50.802
for me and Brooke.

10:50.870 --> 10:53.271
Plus, blue isn't a very good color for me.

10:53.339 --> 10:54.772
What, are you crazy?

10:54.840 --> 10:57.408
You take blue to a whole new level.

10:57.476 --> 10:59.643
All right, let's go blast some cows.

10:59.711 --> 11:01.611
Whoa. All you talk about is being a cop.

11:01.679 --> 11:03.613
You haven't focused on anything this hard

11:03.681 --> 11:06.349
since you thought you heard
your name on "Led Zeppelin II."

11:06.416 --> 11:08.684
It's in there.

11:08.752 --> 11:10.352
In "Whole lotta love,"

11:10.420 --> 11:14.187
he clearly sings, " Kelso lotta love."

11:14.255 --> 11:16.523
Kelso, I'm gonna make
sure you become a cop.

11:16.590 --> 11:19.325
Yeah, we're not gonna let
you throw your life away.

11:19.393 --> 11:21.293
I don't care about that.

11:21.361 --> 11:24.063
Look, I got a few things pending downtown,

11:24.131 --> 11:25.598
and I need someone on the inside.

11:31.771 --> 11:34.739
Jackie, just go see your mom.

11:34.807 --> 11:36.840
She chose you over golden sunsets,

11:36.908 --> 11:38.074
frozen margaritas.

11:38.142 --> 11:41.110
Man, why aren't we down there?

11:41.178 --> 11:43.245
Donna, you don't get her,

11:43.313 --> 11:45.714
because you'll never understand
the intoxicating quality

11:45.781 --> 11:49.217
of getting anything you
want with your looks.

11:49.284 --> 11:51.752
Look, she's just here till
she finds a new meal ticket.

11:51.820 --> 11:53.687
I don't believe that for a minute.

11:53.754 --> 11:55.689
I think she came back to be with you,

11:55.756 --> 11:57.690
not to find some lonely rich guy.

11:57.758 --> 11:59.425
Your mother is a lovely woman.

11:59.493 --> 12:02.728
Donna, Pam and I are gonna catch a movie.

12:02.795 --> 12:06.898
It's my first American date in months.

12:08.567 --> 12:11.135
Your mother is a gold-digging tramp.

12:11.202 --> 12:13.470
I can't believe my mom is going out

12:13.538 --> 12:15.572
with your Bob of a dad.

12:15.639 --> 12:18.241
Oh, what? He's not good enough?

12:18.308 --> 12:20.142
Oh, so you see it, too?

12:22.178 --> 12:24.312
I expected her to go
after a cool rich guy,

12:24.380 --> 12:27.014
like Jack Nicholson or a Bee Gee.

12:27.082 --> 12:29.983
You're dad is cheesy
and corny, like nachos.

12:30.051 --> 12:32.319
Well, then no wonder
your mom is after him.

12:32.386 --> 12:34.521
She'll touch anything from Mexico!

12:34.588 --> 12:36.689
Oh, hey, you take that back right now,

12:36.757 --> 12:39.124
or I will pull your hair really hard!

12:39.192 --> 12:41.059
Oh, yeah.

12:41.127 --> 12:43.928
Eric, not now.

12:43.996 --> 12:45.930
Look, I'm sorry, Donna,
but you cut me off,

12:45.997 --> 12:47.931
and I always thought it was lame

12:47.999 --> 12:49.933
when Kelso said that
girl fights were sexy,

12:50.000 --> 12:52.268
but now I can see he was very right!

12:52.336 --> 12:53.736
So you, hair pull, you, shirt rip.

12:53.803 --> 12:56.238
You'd better go talk to your mom.

12:56.306 --> 12:58.506
You'd better go talk to your dad.

13:02.778 --> 13:04.445
Hmm.

13:04.513 --> 13:08.448
I overplayed my hand there a little bit.

13:11.267 --> 13:14.435
*

13:15.987 --> 13:17.520
Hey, come on, buddy.

13:17.588 --> 13:20.017
Time to go to cop school.

13:22.918 --> 13:24.983
I don't believe this.

13:25.051 --> 13:26.984
I know. King-size pillows
on a twin-size bed.

13:27.052 --> 13:28.886
Why didn't I think of that?

13:28.954 --> 13:31.788
Man, he just split on us.

13:32.857 --> 13:36.025
Ow!

13:37.094 --> 13:38.894
yeah, he's definitely gone.

13:38.962 --> 13:41.063
I guess we'll just leave then.

13:46.902 --> 13:49.803
Oh, that's not fair. You
guys made leaving sounds.

13:56.610 --> 13:57.743
Oh, come on, kitty.

13:57.811 --> 14:00.679
Enough with the silent treatment.

14:00.747 --> 14:04.482
I didn't say that I liked tea

14:04.550 --> 14:06.417
because Pam is pretty.

14:06.484 --> 14:09.252
I said that I liked tea

14:09.320 --> 14:12.188
because you were kind enough

14:12.256 --> 14:16.125
and courageous enough

14:16.192 --> 14:18.827
to open my eyes to a whole new world

14:18.895 --> 14:21.729
of hot beverages,

14:21.797 --> 14:25.533
which is just one of
the millions of things

14:25.600 --> 14:28.301
that you have done to improve my life

14:28.369 --> 14:30.670
over all these years.

14:30.738 --> 14:33.406
So now I'm old.

14:34.741 --> 14:38.110
Mr. Forman, will you please
talk some sense into my dad?

14:38.177 --> 14:40.745
Last night he went on a
date with Jackie's mom.

14:40.813 --> 14:42.247
Oh, you hear that, Red?

14:42.314 --> 14:46.383
Looks like your girlfriend's stepn' out.

14:46.451 --> 14:49.086
Donna, Pam's just what
I've been looking for.

14:49.153 --> 14:52.122
I've loved pretty women,
and I've loved smart women.

14:52.189 --> 14:54.090
And I'm going back to pretty.

14:54.158 --> 14:56.659
Dad, don't you think
it's a little suspicious

14:56.727 --> 14:58.160
that she just got back

14:58.228 --> 14:59.729
and she's already latched on to you?

14:59.796 --> 15:01.864
I'm a very cute man, donna.

15:01.932 --> 15:05.234
Bob, this is clearly upsetting Donna.

15:05.302 --> 15:08.570
How can u date her?

15:08.638 --> 15:11.606
Yeah, how can you date her?

15:11.674 --> 15:14.309
What does that mean?

15:14.377 --> 15:15.410
What?

15:15.478 --> 15:17.079
You emphasized "her,"

15:17.146 --> 15:19.314
like there's something special about her.

15:19.382 --> 15:22.217
I just said what you said,

15:22.285 --> 15:25.187
but you must have missed it
because I was on my way outside

15:25.255 --> 15:27.723
to mow the lawn.

15:32.495 --> 15:35.993
Oh, man, I can't believe Donna is serious

15:36.061 --> 15:37.990
about this celibacy thing.

15:38.058 --> 15:42.554
Fez, how do you cope with not getting any?

15:42.622 --> 15:45.991
I think you know how I cope.

15:46.059 --> 15:48.793
When you don't see me, I'm coping.

15:50.896 --> 15:52.896
Hey, he tried to get away again.

15:52.964 --> 15:54.865
So I had to use his stun gun on him.

15:54.933 --> 15:56.900
Yeah, it didn't hurt, though.

15:56.968 --> 15:58.968
I've done it to myself so many times,

15:59.036 --> 16:01.103
I baly feel it anymore.

16:01.171 --> 16:02.371
Just get in the car.

16:02.439 --> 16:04.439
You guys can take me to the academy,

16:04.507 --> 16:05.907
but as soon as you leave, I'm gone.

16:05.975 --> 16:09.009
All right, Kelso, that's it.
I haven't had sex in weeks.

16:09.077 --> 16:11.311
Fez is a drought not seen

16:11.379 --> 16:13.747
since the great dust
bow, we are tightly wound.

16:13.814 --> 16:16.215
So you'd better tell us
what your real problem is,

16:16.283 --> 16:18.217
or we're gonna freakin' throttle you.

16:18.285 --> 16:20.152
I will tear you apart like a lion.

16:20.219 --> 16:23.688
Okay, look, I don't want to tell you guys,

16:23.756 --> 16:26.123
because I'm afraid you're
gonna make fun of me.

16:26.191 --> 16:29.326
Oh, Kelso, of course we're
gonna make fun of you.

16:29.393 --> 16:32.027
All right, fine. You know what?

16:32.095 --> 16:34.063
It's like I'm going to a new school, okay?

16:34.130 --> 16:37.766
And I'm worried that I'm not
gonna be able to make friends.

16:37.833 --> 16:40.000
First off, I'm so much better looking

16:40.068 --> 16:41.801
than everyone else.

16:41.869 --> 16:43.636
The only reason you
guys are friends with me

16:43.704 --> 16:47.305
is 'cause you met me before I blossomed.

16:47.373 --> 16:49.440
Man, you should be worried about something

16:49.508 --> 16:51.042
that could actually happen,

16:51.110 --> 16:53.744
like handcuffing yourself to a horse.

16:53.812 --> 16:56.045
Look, Kelso, here's the thing...

16:56.113 --> 16:59.081
You've stolen my stuff,
and you've burned my stuff,

16:59.148 --> 17:02.450
you've even groped my stuff.

17:02.517 --> 17:04.784
But I still hang out with you

17:04.852 --> 17:07.986
because you are a great guy.

17:08.054 --> 17:09.921
Come on, you're Michael Kelso, right?

17:09.988 --> 17:11.622
You're bulletproof.

17:11.690 --> 17:15.924
Damn it, you're right. I am bulletproof.

17:15.992 --> 17:18.531
All right, let's get going. All right!

17:18.598 --> 17:20.535
Hey, by the way,

17:20.603 --> 17:23.874
you're not actually bulletproof.

17:28.614 --> 17:30.614
Where do you think you're going?

17:30.682 --> 17:32.215
To the backyard.

17:32.283 --> 17:35.251
Unh-unh, I'm going to the backyard.

17:35.319 --> 17:36.619
Whatever.

17:36.687 --> 17:39.088
Oh, don't give me that dirty
look and say, "whatever."

17:39.156 --> 17:40.756
That is my thing!

17:40.824 --> 17:43.325
Oh, my God!

17:43.393 --> 17:45.427
Hot tub!

17:46.495 --> 17:48.496
Mom, what are you doing in there

17:48.564 --> 17:49.964
with that wet, hairy man?

17:50.031 --> 17:52.365
And why are you wearing a white swimsuit?

17:52.433 --> 17:53.767
It's winter!

17:53.834 --> 17:56.269
Bobby and I are just having a soak.

17:56.336 --> 17:58.070
Bobby?

17:58.138 --> 18:01.540
When did we get a hot tub, Bobby?

18:01.608 --> 18:03.575
Me and Pammy were out shopping,

18:03.643 --> 18:05.576
and I saw it, so I bought it.

18:05.644 --> 18:08.446
Even got the good one
with the euphoria jet.

18:09.681 --> 18:11.115
I love it in here.

18:11.182 --> 18:13.550
You know, if you put salt around the rim,

18:13.618 --> 18:15.552
it'd be like being in a giant margarita.

18:15.619 --> 18:17.053
Hey, what the hell, right?

18:17.121 --> 18:18.921
I have all this extra money,

18:18.989 --> 18:20.923
and Pammy here helped me spend some.

18:20.990 --> 18:22.824
Yeah, that's her specialty.

18:22.892 --> 18:24.859
Oh, you shut up about my mom.

18:24.927 --> 18:26.861
Thank you, Jackie.

18:26.929 --> 18:28.362
I wasn't defending you, ok?

18:28.430 --> 18:29.830
This is just really weird.

18:29.898 --> 18:32.032
Oh, can you both at
least put your hands up

18:32.100 --> 18:33.366
where I can see them?

18:33.434 --> 18:34.868
Enough, all right?

18:34.935 --> 18:36.869
I like Pam, and she likes me.

18:36.937 --> 18:38.371
We're both adults.

18:38.438 --> 18:40.372
So if you two can't handle it,

18:40.440 --> 18:41.873
that's too bad.

18:41.941 --> 18:44.576
Now go inside. You're ruining our soak.

18:44.643 --> 18:47.011
This soak is over.

18:47.078 --> 18:48.812
Then we'll go inside.

18:48.880 --> 18:50.880
Dad, are you naked?

18:50.948 --> 18:53.416
How else am I gonna try the euphoria jet?

19:00.888 --> 19:02.388
Okay, I know we both

19:02.456 --> 19:04.390
have different reasons
for wanting our parents

19:04.458 --> 19:06.024
to stop seeing each other,

19:06.092 --> 19:09.094
like I hate your mom,
and your mom's a tramp.

19:09.161 --> 19:11.762
But we have to join forces
and do everything we can

19:11.830 --> 19:12.730
to break them up.

19:12.797 --> 19:13.764
I'm with you, Donna.

19:13.831 --> 19:15.731
All the couples I've broken up before

19:15.799 --> 19:18.233
were just training till now.

19:18.301 --> 19:20.234
This one's not for popularity

19:20.302 --> 19:22.235
or to make another girl cry.

19:22.303 --> 19:25.504
It's for my beautiful mom and
your mayonnaise-lovin' dad.

19:25.572 --> 19:27.438
Ooh, how's it going, girls?

19:27.506 --> 19:28.906
Not good.

19:28.974 --> 19:31.408
We just saw Bob and Pam in a hot tub.

19:31.443 --> 19:33.410
Bob and Pam are in a hot tub?

19:33.478 --> 19:35.381
Pam's in a hot tub?

19:37.656 --> 19:39.694
There. You did it again.

19:39.762 --> 19:42.365
And this time, you didn't even say "Bob."

19:42.432 --> 19:44.300
Yes, I did.

19:44.367 --> 19:45.567
No, you didn't.

19:45.635 --> 19:47.068
Yes, I did.

19:47.136 --> 19:49.070
And you would have heard it, too,

19:49.138 --> 19:51.939
if it hadn't been for all that damn tea.

19:52.007 --> 19:55.075
You know, I fought a war to keep that crap

19:55.143 --> 19:56.576
out of this country,

19:56.644 --> 19:59.078
and you had to bring it into my house.

19:59.146 --> 20:02.081
And you call yourself an American, huh?

20:07.553 --> 20:10.588
ok. I'm all set.

20:10.655 --> 20:13.257
So here I go.

20:13.324 --> 20:15.792
Kelso, you're gonna do great.

20:15.860 --> 20:17.293
But, hey, just in case,

20:17.361 --> 20:19.295
I packed some extra cookies in your lunch

20:19.363 --> 20:22.397
to help you make friends.

20:22.465 --> 20:25.700
Oh, um, I ate the cookies

20:27.035 --> 20:31.038
try to find a friend who likes carrots.

20:31.105 --> 20:35.108
Ok. Well...

20:35.176 --> 20:37.009
Guess this is it.

20:37.077 --> 20:40.479
Hey, give those cows hell, boys.

20:46.551 --> 20:48.319
Hey, Kelso,

20:48.386 --> 20:50.854
I love you!

20:52.056 --> 20:53.323
Shut up!

20:53.390 --> 20:56.325
I love you, too, Kelso!

20:56.393 --> 20:57.993
You guys, quit it!

20:58.061 --> 21:00.462
I love you the most!

21:04.300 --> 21:06.267
We were just kidding.

21:06.335 --> 21:09.570
So was I. S-so was I.

21:15.086 --> 21:16.653
I can't believe there were no cows, man.

21:16.721 --> 21:20.724
Yeah, what are we gonna do
with all these bottle rockets?

21:26.397 --> 21:31.033
Fine, I'll be the cow.

21:31.101 --> 21:33.002
But this time, count all the way to ten.

21:33.870 --> 21:35.638
You got it, buddy.

21:37.674 --> 21:39.541
One. Ten.
