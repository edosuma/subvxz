Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
back to the Coral Prince

00:17.554 --> 00:20.189
Surf Championship here
at world famous Pipeline.

00:20.257 --> 00:22.291
How about a big hand for all
of our competitors?

00:22.359 --> 00:26.362
On the water, some of the finest
champions both past and present:

00:26.463 --> 00:30.466
we got Ty Samson,
Greg Richardson, Kono Kalakaua.

00:30.533 --> 00:33.335
I miss this, Kono,
being out here

00:33.403 --> 00:35.204
with the people
who mean the most to me.

00:35.272 --> 00:36.405
This is where I want to be.

00:36.473 --> 00:38.741
I think your fans
couldn't agree more.

00:38.808 --> 00:41.977
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
it's my pleasure to introduce

00:42.045 --> 00:46.248
the man behind the brand,
Ian Adams!

00:46.316 --> 00:47.583
That's your cue.

00:47.651 --> 00:50.519
Let's give 'em a show.
Whoo!

00:56.593 --> 00:58.894
Whoo! Go, Ian!

01:17.113 --> 01:18.314
Ian!

01:24.421 --> 01:25.754
Ian!

01:31.995 --> 01:33.929
Got him.
Go, go, go!

01:46.109 --> 01:49.778
Ladies and gentlemen, please
give the lifeguards some room.

01:49.846 --> 01:52.147
Ian! Ian!

01:54.284 --> 01:55.217
He's been shot.

01:57.520 --> 01:58.854
He's dead.

02:46.221 --> 02:47.957
I want this entire beach
on lockdown.

02:47.958 --> 02:50.159
Nobody leaves until
we give the order, okay?

02:50.226 --> 02:51.327
Thank you.

02:52.562 --> 02:53.996
This place is crazy.

02:54.064 --> 02:55.731
All these people-- you'd think
it was the Super Bowl.

02:55.832 --> 02:57.065
It's Hawaii.

02:57.066 --> 02:59.159
The Coral Prince Championship
is our Super Bowl.

02:59.160 --> 03:00.593
Grace keeps asking me
for surfing lessons.

03:00.661 --> 03:01.828
I told her, "No chance."

03:01.896 --> 03:02.862
You got something

03:02.930 --> 03:03.963
against surfing now?

03:04.031 --> 03:05.265
I don't have anything
against surfing.

03:05.332 --> 03:07.500
I have something against sharks,
skin cancer,

03:07.568 --> 03:09.969
anything involving my daughter
wearing a bikini.

03:10.037 --> 03:11.538
Hey,

03:11.605 --> 03:13.573
it's confirmed.

03:13.641 --> 03:14.974
Victim's Ian Adams.

03:15.042 --> 03:16.910
He's the CEO of Coral Prince,

03:16.977 --> 03:19.045
biggest surf brand
in the world.

03:19.113 --> 03:21.147
He was riding a wave and he took
a shot to the chest.

03:21.215 --> 03:24.417
So far, nobody's seen or
heard where the shot came from.

03:24.485 --> 03:25.785
It should be easy. Come on.

03:25.853 --> 03:27.420
It's a nationally televised
event, right? We got to

03:27.488 --> 03:29.322
cameras on it, something
panning the crowd.

03:29.390 --> 03:30.723
All the cameras were
pointed to the water

03:30.791 --> 03:31.891
for the competition.

03:31.959 --> 03:33.459
We're interviewing
the other surfers

03:33.527 --> 03:35.628
in case Ian wasn't the target.
Wait a minute.

03:35.696 --> 03:37.330
Did you catch
the surf report this morning?

03:37.398 --> 03:39.075
Can I ask you what that has
to do with anything?

03:39.100 --> 03:39.999
Just wait.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.670
Yeah, five to eight, swells
from the west, light trades.

03:43.737 --> 03:45.884
That would put the peak
about 50 yards out, right?

03:45.885 --> 03:48.151
Moving target,
hit center mass.

03:48.152 --> 03:50.420
Come on. That's no lucky shot.

03:50.487 --> 03:52.622
Trained sharpshooter,
you're thinking.

03:52.689 --> 03:54.123
Maybe. But whoever did
the shooting,

03:54.191 --> 03:56.592
Ian was definitely
the mark.

03:56.660 --> 03:59.595
This is gonna be
hard on Kono.

03:59.663 --> 04:00.730
Why's that?

04:00.797 --> 04:01.964
She know the vic?

04:02.032 --> 04:03.666
Yeah. Ian signed Kono to a

04:03.734 --> 04:05.468
Coral Prince contract
when she was about 15.

04:05.535 --> 04:07.670
He was really like a
second father to her.

04:07.738 --> 04:09.372
She was actually
riding for the team

04:09.439 --> 04:10.673
when she blew
out her knee.

04:10.741 --> 04:12.341
But instead of dumping her
after that,

04:12.409 --> 04:13.376
Ian covered everything:

04:13.443 --> 04:15.278
surgery, rehab,
all of it,

04:15.345 --> 04:18.014
even though he knew that she was
never gonna compete again.

04:22.252 --> 04:24.654
You okay?

04:24.721 --> 04:26.489
Yeah, I want to go
to the Coral Prince house,

04:26.556 --> 04:27.657
talk to the team,
get statements.

04:27.724 --> 04:29.058
Kono, we can cover this one
for you.

04:29.126 --> 04:30.893
No, I want this one.

04:38.802 --> 04:40.503
I hate it when rich people
get killed.

04:40.570 --> 04:42.204
Why?

04:42.272 --> 04:43.639
They got something
that everybody wants.

04:43.707 --> 04:45.474
Yeah, money.

04:45.542 --> 04:47.677
Which means plenty of suspects.

04:57.054 --> 04:58.087
Next time,
try flip-flops, brah.

04:58.155 --> 04:59.255
I'm gonna pretend

04:59.323 --> 05:00.623
you didn't just say that.

05:00.691 --> 05:03.192
Hey, Chin, see if you can
find out who's in charge.

05:03.260 --> 05:06.829
Start building a profile.
Get some background information.

05:06.897 --> 05:09.832
Financials-- first rule
in homicide investigations.

05:09.900 --> 05:12.835
Follow the money.
Copy that.

05:12.903 --> 05:14.337
So, break it down.

05:14.404 --> 05:15.604
I don't understand.

05:15.672 --> 05:17.773
All these kids live here
or what?

05:17.841 --> 05:19.041
The Coral Prince Surf Team

05:19.109 --> 05:20.676
and their coaches live here
October to January.

05:20.744 --> 05:22.144
I'm sorry. Did you say coaches?
Yeah.

05:22.212 --> 05:23.813
What does that mean
What do they say,

05:23.880 --> 05:25.581
"Don't fall off the foam toy"
or what?

05:25.649 --> 05:28.050
Oh, brah,
where'd you eat it?

05:28.118 --> 05:29.785
I'm sorry. What?

05:29.853 --> 05:31.420
The kine, brah.

05:31.488 --> 05:33.389
I'm sorry.
Are you speaking English?

05:33.457 --> 05:35.224
Hey, no need for get agro.

05:36.626 --> 05:38.294
He caught it
on land, brah.

05:39.463 --> 05:41.063
Danno don't surf.

05:43.367 --> 05:44.467
Shoots.

05:44.534 --> 05:46.969
I dare you to tell me
what he just said.

05:47.037 --> 05:48.170
I'm done.

05:49.840 --> 05:52.018
Excuse me. I'm investigator
Chin Ho Kelly.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.652
Linda Leon.
I was Ian's executive assistant.

05:54.653 --> 05:56.553
Would you have his schedule
from the last week?

05:56.621 --> 05:59.089
Any phone logs, e-mails,
financial transactions?

05:59.157 --> 06:01.058
I can get all that
for you no problem.

06:02.267 --> 06:04.268
What about anything
out of the ordinary recently?

06:04.335 --> 06:05.769
Stalkers, threats?

06:05.837 --> 06:06.970
No, nothing like that.

06:07.038 --> 06:08.806
All Ian talked about lately
was this event

06:08.873 --> 06:10.174
and getting back on his board.

06:10.241 --> 06:13.043
Hmm. Okay.

06:13.111 --> 06:14.244
Did he seem nervous
about today

06:14.312 --> 06:15.913
or give you any hint
that something was wrong?

06:15.980 --> 06:17.614
No. As a matter of fact,

06:17.682 --> 06:19.883
he was happier than he'd been
in a long time.

06:21.286 --> 06:22.853
Meant a lot to Ian

06:22.921 --> 06:24.888
that you came out today, Kono.

06:24.956 --> 06:28.759
He wanted the entire
Coral Prince team there.

06:30.695 --> 06:33.096
Why wasn't Ben there?

06:34.132 --> 06:35.766
You'd have to ask him that

06:35.834 --> 06:39.136
as my son no longer talks to me.

06:39.204 --> 06:41.939
I tried last year

06:42.006 --> 06:44.575
at his mother's funeral,
but he refused.

06:44.642 --> 06:47.211
I think Ian tried to reach out
to him, too,

06:47.278 --> 06:48.512
but nothing ever came of it.

06:50.281 --> 06:52.049
When was the last time
you saw Ben?

06:52.116 --> 06:53.650
I don't know.
It's been years.

06:53.718 --> 06:55.252
Hey, Kono.

06:55.320 --> 06:56.787
Oh. This is Lieutenant
Commander Steve McGarrett.

06:56.855 --> 06:57.955
How you doing?

06:58.022 --> 06:59.223
And Detective
Danny Williams.

06:59.290 --> 07:00.490
Carlton Bass.

07:00.558 --> 07:02.459
Carlton and Ian grew up
surfing together.

07:02.527 --> 07:03.894
Yeah, while Ian was
selling board shorts

07:03.962 --> 07:06.663
out of his van, I was flipping
condos in Waialua.

07:06.731 --> 07:08.031
A couple of beach bums, really.

07:08.099 --> 07:09.733
Never dreamed our businesses
would take off.

07:09.801 --> 07:12.102
What's a real estate company

07:12.170 --> 07:13.670
doing involved in
a surf contest?

07:13.738 --> 07:15.572
Carlton owns about
30 shopping malls

07:15.607 --> 07:17.808
that house Coral Prince stores.

07:17.876 --> 07:19.476
It's been
a lucrative partnership.

07:19.544 --> 07:20.510
Sir?
Hmm?

07:20.578 --> 07:21.979
Sorry to interrupt,
but the press

07:22.046 --> 07:23.380
would like a statement.

07:23.448 --> 07:24.414
Thanks, Randall.

07:24.482 --> 07:25.616
If you'll excuse me.

07:25.683 --> 07:26.950
One more thing
before you go.

07:27.018 --> 07:29.753
Since you and
Ian go back,

07:29.821 --> 07:32.322
you got any idea why someone
would want to kill him?

07:32.390 --> 07:34.992
Look, he marketed

07:35.059 --> 07:37.628
the North Shore surfing
lifestyle to the masses

07:37.695 --> 07:39.196
and he profited wildly.

07:39.264 --> 07:41.865
A lot of people resented that.

07:45.536 --> 07:47.170
But only one pulled the trigger.

07:55.397 --> 07:57.989
This is the view from the
cameraman down in the sand.

07:57.990 --> 07:59.190
Essentially, that's the angle

07:59.258 --> 08:00.591
at which the spectators from
the beach were watching.

08:00.659 --> 08:03.761
Look at the way he falls;

08:03.829 --> 08:06.497
back and to the left.

08:06.565 --> 08:09.200
There's no way that shot
came from the beach.

08:09.268 --> 08:10.868
The bullet came from above.

08:10.936 --> 08:12.203
One of the houses maybe.

08:12.271 --> 08:13.571
Maybe.

08:13.639 --> 08:15.072
The M.E. said the angle of
entry was about 30 degrees.

08:15.140 --> 08:18.576
Cuz, I didn't
see you there.

08:19.711 --> 08:22.313
Hey, Kono, listen, why don't you

08:22.381 --> 08:24.048
sit this one out?
Just take the day.

08:24.116 --> 08:27.051
No, I'm fine.

08:27.119 --> 08:29.253
Cuz, take the day.

08:29.321 --> 08:32.089
You know I can't do that.

08:32.157 --> 08:35.293
Part of doing this job
is knowing when

08:35.360 --> 08:37.294
you're not the one
to do the job.

08:44.336 --> 08:45.403
She's good.

08:45.470 --> 08:46.737
All right. Shooter.

08:46.805 --> 08:50.608
All right, so if the angle
of entry is

08:50.676 --> 08:52.443
roughly 30 degrees...

08:52.511 --> 08:56.380
that puts the bullet's
trajectory here.

08:56.448 --> 08:58.249
Okay, so the shot was fired

08:58.317 --> 09:00.318
from the Pupukea ridgeline
above the houses.

09:00.385 --> 09:03.421
Yeah. The only problem is
there are no roads

09:03.488 --> 09:05.156
going in
or out of there.

09:05.223 --> 09:07.191
We don't need roads.

09:52.337 --> 09:53.704
Hey.

09:55.974 --> 09:57.108
What are you doing here?

09:57.175 --> 09:58.676
Boss told you to beat it, huh?

09:58.744 --> 10:00.845
Look, I really
don't want

10:00.912 --> 10:03.147
to see that face he makes
when we don't do

10:03.215 --> 10:04.515
what he tells us to do.

10:04.583 --> 10:06.684
I call it his
"constipated look."

10:09.454 --> 10:11.989
I know.

10:12.057 --> 10:14.892
Hey...

10:14.960 --> 10:17.962
Hey, you cannot blame yourself,
okay?

10:19.931 --> 10:22.066
Okay.

10:22.134 --> 10:23.868
I just felt helpless out there.

10:23.935 --> 10:26.771
I know. Cops are supposed
to come in and save the day,

10:26.838 --> 10:28.139
but sometimes we just can't.

10:32.010 --> 10:34.812
Did you ever have a teacher
that turned you around?

10:34.880 --> 10:37.448
Someone that made you look
at everything in whole new way?

10:38.483 --> 10:40.618
Yeah, actually.

10:40.685 --> 10:42.253
Mrs. Stojak,

10:42.320 --> 10:44.722
my sixth-grade
history teacher.

10:44.790 --> 10:46.157
Till I met her, I thought

10:46.224 --> 10:49.627
that the Cold War
was fought in Alaska.

10:51.363 --> 10:53.364
Well, Ian was my Mrs. Stojak,

10:53.432 --> 10:56.734
and surfing was more
than just a sport to him.

10:56.802 --> 10:59.437
It was... it was Earth
and the sun

10:59.504 --> 11:01.906
and the sky and the water
and the heart.

11:04.142 --> 11:05.676
It was everything.

11:05.744 --> 11:07.378
And he passed that on
to his surfers,

11:07.446 --> 11:08.779
and it made up better people.

11:12.784 --> 11:14.385
I need to pay him back for that,

11:14.453 --> 11:16.587
and I can't do that
sitting here.

11:17.889 --> 11:19.857
I understand.

11:36.741 --> 11:38.008
What do you think?

11:40.557 --> 11:42.257
The shot took some skill.

11:43.728 --> 11:45.185
You know, guys who grew up
hunting boar around here

11:45.186 --> 11:46.252
could make that shot.

11:46.320 --> 11:47.554
Yeah, also factor in

11:47.621 --> 11:50.090
all the qualified military
personnel on the island.

11:50.157 --> 11:51.491
Then we're looking at
a suspect pool

11:51.559 --> 11:53.560
of, oh, only a couple
thousand guys.

11:53.627 --> 11:55.795
All right, so the bullet's
trajectory puts our shooter

11:55.863 --> 11:57.831
somewhere along
this ridge line.

11:57.898 --> 11:58.965
Hopefully, he left
something behind.

11:59.033 --> 12:00.433
Okay.

12:00.501 --> 12:02.802
I'll start at the northern edge
of the trajectory zone

12:02.870 --> 12:04.637
and work my way towards you.
Good.

12:13.547 --> 12:15.014
Excuse me.

12:15.082 --> 12:17.350
The guy at Giovanni's said
Ben Bass was down here.

12:17.418 --> 12:18.885
Have you seen him?

12:18.953 --> 12:21.521
I don't know. Have you?

12:22.756 --> 12:23.957
Ben?

12:24.024 --> 12:25.458
Kono.

12:27.862 --> 12:29.195
Oh.

12:31.365 --> 12:32.966
Where's your hair?

12:33.033 --> 12:34.801
Where's your retainer?

12:34.869 --> 12:36.136
Fair enough.

12:36.203 --> 12:38.505
Well, look at you,
Mr. Environmentalist.

12:38.606 --> 12:40.707
So you work for  Ocean Protectors?
Yeah.

12:40.774 --> 12:42.008
Yeah.

12:42.076 --> 12:44.577
How you been, Kono?

12:45.613 --> 12:47.280
Well, I'm a cop.

12:47.348 --> 12:48.448
Of course.

12:48.516 --> 12:50.016
Family business.
Mm-hmm.

12:50.084 --> 12:52.819
So are you here as a cop?

12:54.522 --> 12:56.723
And as a friend.

12:58.392 --> 13:00.860
I want to talk to you about Ian.

13:01.896 --> 13:05.398
Yeah. I'm sorry.

13:05.466 --> 13:08.168
Look, you and Ian were close.

13:08.235 --> 13:11.304
Do you know of anyone that would
have wanted to hurt him?

13:12.773 --> 13:14.307
We were close a long time ago.

13:14.375 --> 13:16.376
Before the money.

13:16.443 --> 13:19.412
Once he became the same
greedy beast as my father,

13:19.480 --> 13:21.748
well, we didn't have

13:21.815 --> 13:23.850
much in common.

13:23.918 --> 13:25.919
You sound pretty angry with him.

13:27.321 --> 13:29.055
Disappointed.

13:29.123 --> 13:32.525
Were there a lot of people
disappointed in him?

13:32.593 --> 13:34.360
Yeah.

13:34.428 --> 13:36.496
But whether that
got him killed--

13:36.564 --> 13:38.431
I don't know.

13:38.499 --> 13:41.467
I couldn't stand
to be around him anymore.

13:41.535 --> 13:44.671
Is that why you weren't at
the Coral Prince house today?

13:44.772 --> 13:47.340
That's not my scene
anymore, Kono.

13:47.408 --> 13:50.977
Besides, my dad was there,
and that's...

13:51.045 --> 13:52.545
Well...

13:52.613 --> 13:55.848
I don't know, when
I heard about Ian,

13:55.916 --> 13:58.284
I wanted to remember him
in my own way, you know?

13:58.352 --> 13:59.752
So I came out here.

14:07.695 --> 14:10.296
Whoever killed Ian Adams

14:10.364 --> 14:11.331
definitely came prepared.

14:11.398 --> 14:12.966
I got indentations

14:13.033 --> 14:14.033
from the shooter's body.

14:14.101 --> 14:15.568
Powder burns
and scorch marks

14:15.636 --> 14:17.270
on the grass from
the muzzle flash

14:17.338 --> 14:19.138
and I just bagged a seven mill.
Nice.

14:19.206 --> 14:20.473
You get anything?

14:20.541 --> 14:22.408
Yeah. Something
you should see.

14:26.280 --> 14:28.147
This whole area
is a hunting ground.

14:28.215 --> 14:29.682
It's crawling with wild boar.

14:31.885 --> 14:34.487
By the looks of things,
someone bled one out here

14:34.555 --> 14:35.855
pretty recently.
Mm-hmm.

14:35.923 --> 14:37.090
Whoever it was,

14:37.157 --> 14:38.958
decided to tag his turf.

14:44.798 --> 14:46.532
This is Kapu hunting area.

14:47.735 --> 14:50.336
<i>So, uh, who are the Kapu?</i>

14:50.404 --> 14:52.205
Part lifeguard, part
unofficial security force

14:52.273 --> 14:53.840
for the North Shore.

14:53.907 --> 14:55.475
Kind of like protectors
for the island.

14:55.542 --> 14:56.609
Protecting the island

14:56.677 --> 14:57.977
from who?

15:01.749 --> 15:03.283
Oh, the <i>haoles.</i> I get it.

15:03.317 --> 15:04.917
Protection from
the <i>haoles.</i> Sorry.

15:04.985 --> 15:07.353
They look after the North Shore
and the Hawaiian way of life.

15:07.421 --> 15:08.588
So what does that mean?

15:08.656 --> 15:10.023
So they're out there giving
speeding tickets

15:10.090 --> 15:11.324
for surfing too fast? Huh?

15:11.392 --> 15:12.959
They're making sure
all the radio stations

15:13.027 --> 15:14.694
are playing Don Ho records?

15:14.762 --> 15:17.030
You make them sound
like the Hawaiian Boys Scouts.

15:17.097 --> 15:19.265
Yeah, Boy Scouts that will
beat you to a pulp

15:19.333 --> 15:20.566
if you disrespect
their land.

15:22.102 --> 15:23.603
You're looking at every
member of the Kapu.

15:23.671 --> 15:24.671
Well, you got them all

15:24.738 --> 15:26.673
committed to memory.

15:26.740 --> 15:28.875
It's a pretty exclusive club.
They're all very proud.

15:28.942 --> 15:31.444
No one hides affiliation.
In the '70s and '80s,

15:31.512 --> 15:33.346
the Kapu were heavy
into cocaine sales

15:33.414 --> 15:34.414
and trafficking.

15:34.481 --> 15:35.882
But once surfing became
big business,

15:35.949 --> 15:37.150
they went legit.

15:37.217 --> 15:38.484
Started helping brands
like Coral Prince

15:38.552 --> 15:40.320
establish a footing
on the North Shore.

15:40.387 --> 15:41.888
All right, do me a favor.

15:41.955 --> 15:44.090
Narrow these guys down to the
ones who have criminal records,

15:44.158 --> 15:45.525
and see if any of them

15:45.592 --> 15:47.026
have any ties
to Ian Adams.

15:54.568 --> 15:56.369
Hello, Levi Parker
and Diego Stone.

15:56.437 --> 15:58.037
Multiple weapons charges,

15:58.105 --> 15:59.739
felony B&E.

15:59.807 --> 16:01.674
Looks like they just graduated
from Halawa Correctional

16:01.742 --> 16:03.643
on a assault charge.

16:03.711 --> 16:05.044
Look at this.

16:05.112 --> 16:06.212
During the trial

16:06.280 --> 16:08.314
the prosecution's
key witness--

16:08.382 --> 16:09.482
Ian Adams.

16:09.550 --> 16:10.883
Which means
they've got motive.

16:10.951 --> 16:12.051
Congratulations.

16:12.119 --> 16:13.986
Levi, Diego,
you're going back to jail.

16:24.370 --> 16:25.743
Can I just ask you
what we're doing here?

16:25.744 --> 16:27.823
I swear to God, Danny,
if you ask me that again

16:27.824 --> 16:29.212
- I'm going to shoot you.
- Then shoot me.

16:29.214 --> 16:30.181
Seriously, just shoot me,

16:30.249 --> 16:31.382
because I'm not
taking another step

16:31.450 --> 16:32.784
until you explain
it to me again.

16:32.851 --> 16:34.218
I've explained it three times.

16:34.286 --> 16:37.155
Which is an indication of how
ridiculous this detour is.

16:37.222 --> 16:38.956
It's not a detour.
It's a strategic op.

16:39.024 --> 16:41.659
It... A strategic op?

16:41.727 --> 16:43.294
That's a...
You know what I like most--

16:43.362 --> 16:45.363
is how you were able to say
that with a straight face.

16:45.430 --> 16:46.831
So what's the problem?

16:46.899 --> 16:48.232
The problem

16:48.300 --> 16:50.401
is Levi Parker
and Diego Stone.

16:50.469 --> 16:52.236
They are the problem.

16:52.304 --> 16:54.071
Yet we are going
to the Tropics Bar

16:54.139 --> 16:55.873
at Hilton Hawaiian Village
to talk the president

16:55.941 --> 16:57.141
of a surf club.

16:57.209 --> 16:58.376
- Danny.
- What?

16:58.443 --> 17:01.279
On this island there is
an easy way to do things

17:01.346 --> 17:03.181
and a hard way.

17:03.248 --> 17:06.083
With the Kapu,
talking to Kawika

17:06.151 --> 17:10.721
before we go after Levi
and Diego is the easy way.

17:10.789 --> 17:13.958
Ah, so what's throwing
somebody in a shark tank

17:14.026 --> 17:16.027
and then hanging
another guy off a roof?

17:17.496 --> 17:19.396
Those guys were
from out of town.

17:19.464 --> 17:21.833
You're a sick person,
you know that.

17:21.900 --> 17:24.035
In the best possible way,
though, right?

17:24.102 --> 17:26.103
No, no, not in
the best possible way.

17:26.171 --> 17:27.571
In a very terrible way.

17:27.638 --> 17:30.575
It is not a compliment,
you understand?

17:33.111 --> 17:35.880
<i>We loved Ian.</i>

17:35.948 --> 17:38.316
Half of the club is employed
by Coral Prince

17:38.383 --> 17:40.718
as store clerks,
team managers,

17:40.786 --> 17:42.153
warehouse guys.

17:42.221 --> 17:43.187
Mahalo.

17:43.255 --> 17:44.755
What is that?

17:46.658 --> 17:48.793
It's called a Blue Hawaii.

17:48.861 --> 17:50.361
You have a problem with that?

17:50.429 --> 17:51.863
No, no, no. I'd
like one actually.

17:51.930 --> 17:54.365
I just got to get with
no alcohol 'cause we're on duty.

17:54.433 --> 17:56.367
They call that a virgin?

17:56.435 --> 17:57.635
I call it not getting fired.

17:57.703 --> 17:59.237
Excuse me, two more.

17:59.304 --> 17:59.704
Thank you.

17:59.771 --> 18:00.504
call that a virgin?

18:00.572 --> 18:01.172
I ll it not getting fired.

18:01.240 --> 18:01.672
Excuse me, two more.

18:01.740 --> 18:02.707
Thank you.

18:02.774 --> 18:06.210
Kawika, listen,
we need your help.

18:06.278 --> 18:08.880
The shot that took out
Ian came from Pupukea.

18:08.947 --> 18:10.281
That's Kapu turf.

18:10.349 --> 18:12.450
Two of your boys are suspects.

18:12.517 --> 18:14.919
Levi and Diego.

18:14.987 --> 18:18.155
Levi and Diego
are no longer Kapu.

18:18.223 --> 18:20.157
Why is that?

18:20.225 --> 18:23.060
They became too violent
and were let go.

18:23.128 --> 18:25.129
Okay. Do you know where
we could find them?

18:25.197 --> 18:26.931
Of course.

18:26.999 --> 18:28.466
Good.

18:28.533 --> 18:30.568
Feel free to share
that information

18:30.636 --> 18:32.770
with us any time.

18:32.838 --> 18:34.505
Give me one good reason

18:34.573 --> 18:36.774
why I should cooperate
with you, <i>haole?</i>

18:36.842 --> 18:38.809
Okay. You said

18:38.877 --> 18:40.478
you loved Ian.

18:40.545 --> 18:41.979
And here's an opportunity
for you

18:42.047 --> 18:43.614
to help us catch his killers.

18:46.585 --> 18:48.753
Okay, maybe you just liked
him a little bit, I don't know.

18:48.820 --> 18:50.187
Watch yourself, <i>haole.</i>

18:50.255 --> 18:51.322
There it is again--
the "H" word.

18:51.390 --> 18:52.924
You know, it's
Detective Williams

18:52.991 --> 18:54.258
or Danny...
I got other words,

18:54.326 --> 18:57.128
but they all mean don't tell me
what to do on my island.

18:57.195 --> 18:59.797
This is my island, too, Kawika.

18:59.865 --> 19:02.099
- Is that right?
- That's right.

19:02.167 --> 19:04.402
My father and my mother
are both buried here.

19:04.469 --> 19:07.605
And my grandfather died
on December 7, 1941,

19:07.673 --> 19:09.941
defending the same land
you want to protect.

19:10.008 --> 19:11.375
We may go at it
different ways,

19:11.443 --> 19:13.010
but we got the same
endgame, brah,

19:13.078 --> 19:14.578
so help us.

19:15.881 --> 19:17.648
Otherwise we'll just find
these guys ourselves

19:17.716 --> 19:20.785
and then I'll come back here
and I'll arrest your ass

19:20.852 --> 19:22.253
for obstruction of justice.

19:32.197 --> 19:35.733
I came here today
out of respect,

19:35.801 --> 19:37.335
Kawika.

19:37.402 --> 19:41.272
If you want to do things
a different way, I'm game.

19:42.574 --> 19:44.208
Your grandfather died
at Pearl Harbor?

19:44.276 --> 19:45.810
He went down with the <i>Arizona.</i>

19:45.877 --> 19:47.545
He's still entombed there.

19:51.616 --> 19:55.353
Then consider this a favor
for him, for his sacrifice.

19:55.420 --> 19:57.288
I'll bring Levi and Diego
to you.

19:57.356 --> 19:59.090
You got my word.

20:00.325 --> 20:01.692
Thank you.

20:03.462 --> 20:06.864
Okay. Thank you very much.

20:11.903 --> 20:13.904
You want me to pay?

20:13.972 --> 20:15.706
<i>Haole,</i> you took
eight islands from us.

20:15.774 --> 20:19.110
The least you could do is pick
up the tab every now and then.

20:20.345 --> 20:21.912
The least you could do.

20:21.980 --> 20:23.981
Okay.

20:27.853 --> 20:31.088
<i>When is the last time</i>
<i>you talked to Ian?</i>

20:31.156 --> 20:32.690
He stopped by here
a couple nights ago.

20:32.758 --> 20:34.091
Really? Why?

20:34.159 --> 20:36.293
I asked him the same thing.

20:36.361 --> 20:38.462
Said he wanted us
to be friends again.

20:38.530 --> 20:39.597
That he'd changed.

20:39.664 --> 20:40.931
What did you say?

20:40.999 --> 20:43.167
I told him to put his
money where his mouth was.

20:43.235 --> 20:44.735
Then I'd believe him.

20:44.803 --> 20:46.771
Ben's got a girlfriend.

20:46.838 --> 20:48.372
Howzit.

20:48.440 --> 20:50.641
So you live here?

20:50.709 --> 20:53.944
On the beach?

20:54.012 --> 20:55.346
Over a year now.

20:55.414 --> 20:57.748
I drive by this place
so many times.

20:57.816 --> 20:59.050
I've never stopped.

20:59.117 --> 21:00.985
Most people
speed past it.

21:01.053 --> 21:03.254
They think we're a bunch
of homeless meth addicts.

21:03.321 --> 21:05.589
Couldn't be farther
from the truth.

21:05.657 --> 21:07.792
Ben-bo, I made this for you.

21:07.859 --> 21:08.959
Thank you, Kaila.

21:09.027 --> 21:10.661
You know I love these
bracelets, right?

21:12.064 --> 21:14.765
Since my friend Kono
is visiting, do you think

21:14.833 --> 21:16.567
maybe we could
give this one to her?

21:16.635 --> 21:18.069
Sure.

21:22.808 --> 21:24.108
Mahalo, Kaila.

21:24.176 --> 21:25.976
You have pretty hair.
So do you.

21:30.382 --> 21:33.017
Kaila's mom runs a
clothing store on Waikiki.

21:33.085 --> 21:36.320
That guy-- he works
at the Bank of Hawaii.

21:36.388 --> 21:40.191
Most of these people have got
jobs and cars and families.

21:40.258 --> 21:42.960
It costs millions of dollars
to buy a house here.

21:43.028 --> 21:46.130
So instead of moving off
the land of their ancestors,

21:46.198 --> 21:48.099
they choose to live this way.

21:48.166 --> 21:50.334
So who owns the land, the state?
Mm-hmm.

21:50.402 --> 21:53.370
Neighbors are trying
to get rid of us.

21:53.438 --> 21:54.638
I can't imagine
they love a tent city

21:54.706 --> 21:56.207
in the middle of mansion-ville.

21:56.274 --> 21:59.343
There's been a lot of
threats, some damage.

21:59.411 --> 22:01.078
It's getting worse.

22:01.146 --> 22:04.181
What can we do about it?

22:04.249 --> 22:05.516
We?

22:05.584 --> 22:07.084
I like that.

22:14.593 --> 22:16.494
My tongue's
the same color as my shirt.

22:16.561 --> 22:18.496
You didn't have to drink it.
Oh, I didn't?

22:18.563 --> 22:21.732
I apologize if I'm not, uh,

22:21.800 --> 22:25.136
if I'm not familiar with
the rules of strategic ops.

22:25.203 --> 22:26.904
Okay, I-I mean,
I thought that sitting around

22:26.972 --> 22:27.905
drinking a 24-ounce cocktail

22:27.973 --> 22:29.507
was standard
operating procedure.

22:29.574 --> 22:31.008
Well, it worked.

22:31.076 --> 22:33.010
The Kapu said they'd get us
Levi and Diego, didn't they?

22:33.078 --> 22:34.378
I don't know.
I don't know.

22:34.446 --> 22:36.180
All I know is I'm standing here
while two murder suspects

22:36.248 --> 22:38.215
could be on a plane right now
flying back to the mainland.

22:38.283 --> 22:40.184
Okay? Would you relax.
Just trust me, okay?

22:40.252 --> 22:43.354
If the Kapu say they
deliver, they'll deliver.

22:43.421 --> 22:45.322
They were supposed
to be here an hour ago.

22:45.390 --> 22:47.191
So I'm just curious,
where are they?

22:47.259 --> 22:48.292
Huh?

22:48.360 --> 22:50.227
Island time.

22:52.864 --> 22:55.432
Right on schedule.

23:06.011 --> 23:07.578
Mahalo.

23:12.217 --> 23:13.417
How you guys doing?

23:13.485 --> 23:15.119
You all right?

23:15.187 --> 23:17.888
Couple years back, you two got
pinched on an assault charge,

23:17.956 --> 23:20.457
and Ian's testimony
is what put you guys away.

23:20.525 --> 23:21.992
So I was just
thinking about it.

23:22.060 --> 23:23.260
When you're locked up in

23:23.328 --> 23:25.996
the state penitentiary,
got time to think about things,

23:26.064 --> 23:27.498
plot revenge.

23:27.566 --> 23:29.333
What the hell you talking about?

23:29.401 --> 23:32.102
We found your hangout
up on Pupukea Ridge.

23:32.170 --> 23:34.238
It's crazy 'cause there's a...

23:34.306 --> 23:36.674
there's a clear view
of the Pipeline from there.

23:36.741 --> 23:38.075
Nah, brah.

23:38.143 --> 23:39.944
You don't cross Kawika
and get away with it.

23:40.011 --> 23:41.478
Ian was protected
by the Kapu.

23:41.546 --> 23:42.846
So where were you

23:42.914 --> 23:44.348
during the Coral Prince
Championship?

23:44.416 --> 23:45.416
With our P.O.

23:45.483 --> 23:46.417
Really?

23:46.484 --> 23:47.751
Call him.

23:47.819 --> 23:49.420
I'm going to call him.
I'm gonna call him right here,

23:49.487 --> 23:50.754
and you're gonna
sit there and watch me.

23:50.822 --> 23:53.190
And if your parole officer
doesn't vouch for you,

23:53.258 --> 23:54.558
we're gonna become
a lot less friendly.

23:54.626 --> 23:55.793
Well, he will;
I'm always cordial.

23:58.930 --> 24:00.831
Yeah, Manny, this is
Detective Danny Williams.

24:00.899 --> 24:02.533
Brah, hey.

24:02.601 --> 24:04.501
You'll tell Kawika
we're cool, right?

24:04.569 --> 24:05.769
We never do nothing.

24:05.837 --> 24:06.904
Having a little conversation

24:06.972 --> 24:08.839
with your boys
Levi and Diego.

24:08.907 --> 24:10.574
Yeah.

24:10.642 --> 24:12.309
You want to vouch
for these guys?

24:14.179 --> 24:16.046
Thank you very much.

24:16.114 --> 24:17.448
They're telling
the truth.

24:17.515 --> 24:18.916
All right, get out of here.

24:22.587 --> 24:24.688
Great, back to
square one.

24:24.756 --> 24:26.156
No suspects.

24:26.224 --> 24:28.626
♪ Hey, hey, hey, hey ♪

24:28.693 --> 24:33.163
♪ Your lipstick stains ♪

24:33.231 --> 24:38.502
♪ On the front lobe
of my left side brains ♪

24:38.570 --> 24:40.004
♪ I knew I wouldn't
forget you... ♪

24:40.071 --> 24:44.174
You've come a long way
from your condo at Diamond Head

24:44.242 --> 24:47.177
and all that Coral Prince swag.

24:47.245 --> 24:51.215
Yeah, the only thing I miss
from that time is my mom.

24:51.283 --> 24:53.484
I'm sorry.

24:53.551 --> 24:54.852
I wanted to come to the service,

24:54.919 --> 24:56.220
but I heard it was
family only.

24:56.288 --> 25:00.257
Yeah, that was my dad's idea.

25:00.325 --> 25:02.493
What happened between you two?

25:05.130 --> 25:08.399
We were on a boat
trip, surfing Bali.

25:08.466 --> 25:10.067
Coral Prince owns a
factory down there.

25:10.135 --> 25:13.937
So, one day, I go with Dad
and Ian to check it out,

25:14.005 --> 25:17.841
and the thing is pouring
pollution into the water.

25:17.909 --> 25:19.476
And it's built on wetlands,

25:19.544 --> 25:21.011
which is crucial
to the eco-structure.

25:21.079 --> 25:22.513
I mean, it should be
protected land.

25:22.580 --> 25:24.181
When I said
that to Ian,

25:24.249 --> 25:25.716
you know what
he said to me, Kono?

25:25.784 --> 25:27.718
What?

25:27.786 --> 25:30.220
"That's the cost
of doing big business."

25:30.288 --> 25:33.290
And my father
agreed.

25:33.358 --> 25:36.694
So protect Hawaii
and screw the rest of the world?

25:36.761 --> 25:37.695
Exactly.

25:37.762 --> 25:38.896
Hypocrite.

25:38.963 --> 25:41.799
I know it hurts you
to hear this, Kono,

25:41.866 --> 25:43.267
but that's
what Ian was.

25:43.335 --> 25:45.269
He and my father
had it all planned.

25:45.337 --> 25:48.405
They were going to rule
the world together.

25:48.473 --> 25:50.107
I didn't want any part of it.

25:52.143 --> 25:53.577
Lived in Bali
for a year.

25:53.645 --> 25:55.012
Then one day, I got the call

25:55.080 --> 25:56.613
that Mom was sick
and I came back.

25:56.681 --> 25:59.116
And you stayed.

26:01.152 --> 26:02.586
This place...

26:04.622 --> 26:06.824
Kamaaina,

26:06.891 --> 26:08.959
it's my home now.

26:11.529 --> 26:12.796
Come on,

26:12.864 --> 26:14.832
I want to show
you something.

26:14.899 --> 26:16.633
Come on.

26:29.013 --> 26:30.280
Hey, you recognize
those two kids?

26:32.417 --> 26:33.984
That was the day
you won the championship.

26:35.053 --> 26:37.254
You blew out
your knee.

26:39.157 --> 26:41.125
After that,
everything changed.

26:41.192 --> 26:43.293
But at this moment,

26:43.361 --> 26:44.828
man, life was good.

26:44.896 --> 26:47.865
You got all the girls
back then.

26:47.932 --> 26:49.333
Yeah.

26:49.401 --> 26:51.402
Except for the one
I really wanted.

27:22.834 --> 27:24.468
Kaila, watch out!

27:35.246 --> 27:36.980
Get down, get down!

27:39.818 --> 27:41.285
Get out of here! Go!

27:53.587 --> 27:54.618
Hey, you okay?

27:54.619 --> 27:56.153
Yeah, I'm fine.
I got a partial plate number

27:56.221 --> 27:57.388
off one of the bikes.
Nice work.

27:57.455 --> 27:59.089
Listen, I'm gonna
get HPD to sit on

27:59.157 --> 28:01.258
that beach village until
we find out who attacked it.

28:01.326 --> 28:02.926
What is the point of
burning a place like that down?

28:02.994 --> 28:04.094
I mean, those people
haven't done anything.

28:04.162 --> 28:05.262
It's got nothing
to do with the people,

28:05.330 --> 28:06.263
it's all about the land.

28:06.331 --> 28:08.232
Hey. I just
got off the phone

28:08.300 --> 28:10.000
with a diving buddy
of mine over at

28:10.068 --> 28:12.236
the Office of Conservation
and Coastal Lands.

28:12.304 --> 28:14.038
She told me that the lobbying
got pretty heavy recently

28:14.105 --> 28:15.973
to take that land private
and zone it for commercial use.

28:16.041 --> 28:18.108
Apparently, there were a number
of bidders on the table.

28:18.176 --> 28:19.677
All the typical players
popping up,

28:19.744 --> 28:21.478
but there was one holding
company on the fast track.

28:21.546 --> 28:23.280
They even had money in escrow.

28:23.348 --> 28:25.749
Shortfin
International.

28:25.817 --> 28:28.218
Guess who owns it.

28:29.321 --> 28:30.921
Ian Adams.

28:30.989 --> 28:31.922
Okay, so wait a minute.

28:31.990 --> 28:33.657
So what if Ben Bass found out

28:33.725 --> 28:36.460
that Ian Adams is trying to buy
the land he's trying to protect?

28:36.528 --> 28:38.696
If I'm Ben Bass, I'm not happy.

28:40.498 --> 28:42.066
What is it, cuz?

28:44.102 --> 28:46.036
Ben has a rifle.

28:46.104 --> 28:47.037
He used it to

28:47.105 --> 28:48.539
scare off the men
who attacked the camp.

28:48.606 --> 28:50.841
But there's no way
he could've...

28:50.909 --> 28:52.810
Okay, wait a minute.
If he's got motive and means,

28:52.877 --> 28:53.977
he is a person of interest.

28:54.045 --> 28:55.112
All right.

28:55.180 --> 28:56.714
Danny and I will
go and talk to Ben

28:56.781 --> 28:57.781
and run that rifle
through ballistics.

28:57.849 --> 28:59.183
No. Let me.

28:59.250 --> 29:01.852
If Ben is a suspect, I need
to be the one to tell him.

29:01.920 --> 29:03.187
All right.

29:03.254 --> 29:04.188
Chin,

29:04.255 --> 29:05.289
look into
this land deal, okay?

29:05.357 --> 29:06.690
See if you can find out who else

29:06.758 --> 29:08.325
knew about it,
and you can start with

29:08.393 --> 29:09.993
Ian Adams'
executive assistant.

29:19.755 --> 29:21.856
So Coral Prince put
a multimillion dollar bid

29:21.924 --> 29:23.824
on a controversial piece of land
that's right where

29:23.892 --> 29:25.493
the beach village is,
and you don't think

29:25.561 --> 29:26.894
that's relevant to Ian's murder?

29:26.962 --> 29:28.062
I didn't know about it.

29:28.130 --> 29:29.063
Ian kept things

29:29.131 --> 29:30.464
very close
to the vest.

29:30.532 --> 29:33.067
Here's all of his expenditures
for the past six months.

29:33.135 --> 29:34.068
Land projects,

29:34.136 --> 29:36.571
donations, payroll.

29:36.638 --> 29:38.439
Who are the Gillis Brothers?

29:38.507 --> 29:40.775
I have no idea.
I've never heard of them.

29:40.842 --> 29:42.944
Well, Ian paid them twice
in the two weeks before he died.

29:44.646 --> 29:46.013
Gillis Brothers
is a law firm.

29:46.081 --> 29:47.882
They aren't one of
Coral Prince's law firms.

29:47.950 --> 29:49.016
I'd know about them.

29:49.084 --> 29:50.685
Check his personal e-mail.

29:50.752 --> 29:52.787
See if he corresponded
with them.

29:52.854 --> 29:54.855
There.

29:57.092 --> 29:59.260
They were his personal
estate planning attorneys.

30:02.698 --> 30:04.165
He was changing his will.

30:10.405 --> 30:11.572
Kono.
Yeah?

30:11.640 --> 30:13.741
Ian Adams changed his will
just before he died.

30:13.809 --> 30:14.742
Why?

30:14.810 --> 30:16.410
To make Ben Bass
his beneficiary.

30:16.478 --> 30:17.411
What?

30:17.479 --> 30:18.546
Why would he do that?

30:18.614 --> 30:20.081
I don't know, but I'm gonna go

30:20.148 --> 30:21.616
speak with the attorneys
and see if I can

30:21.683 --> 30:22.817
get a copy of that new will.

30:22.884 --> 30:23.818
But, Kono,

30:23.885 --> 30:26.087
Ben stood to inherit everything.

30:26.154 --> 30:27.555
That's even more motive.

30:29.958 --> 30:31.826
I'll call you back.

30:31.893 --> 30:34.562
This is where you work?

30:34.630 --> 30:35.896
Tough girl, huh?

30:35.964 --> 30:37.298
When I have to be.

30:37.366 --> 30:38.399
So what's going on?

30:38.467 --> 30:40.167
I got the message
you wanted to talk.

30:42.237 --> 30:44.472
Did you know that Ian
recently changed his will

30:44.539 --> 30:48.075
to name you his estate's
primary beneficiary?

30:48.143 --> 30:50.311
Uh, uh, no.

30:50.379 --> 30:52.413
He was also in the final stages
of purchasing the land

30:52.481 --> 30:53.614
the beach village is on.

30:53.682 --> 30:55.483
What?

30:55.550 --> 30:57.818
Are you saying you didn't know?

30:57.886 --> 30:59.520
Am I saying
I didn't know?

30:59.588 --> 31:00.821
No, I didn't know.

31:00.889 --> 31:03.257
You know, like I said,
Ian came around the village

31:03.325 --> 31:05.426
the last couple weeks,
saying he was a changed man.

31:05.494 --> 31:07.695
I didn't buy it.

31:07.763 --> 31:10.097
You have to give me
more than that.

31:10.165 --> 31:12.967
Like what?

31:13.035 --> 31:17.138
If-If Ian was buying the land to
develop it and evict all of you,

31:17.205 --> 31:18.706
you had motive to kill him.

31:18.774 --> 31:19.807
Come on, Kono.

31:19.875 --> 31:21.609
You don't honestly think I...

31:21.677 --> 31:22.977
Ben, I have to ask the question.

31:23.045 --> 31:24.211
It's my job.

31:24.279 --> 31:27.948
You brought me here
because I'm a suspect?

31:28.016 --> 31:31.252
No one can confirm your alibi

31:31.320 --> 31:34.221
because you were alone on the
beach collecting water samples.

31:34.289 --> 31:35.456
That's right, I was.

31:35.524 --> 31:37.124
You saw me...
You have a hunting license.

31:37.192 --> 31:38.726
And so do most of the guys
who grew up

31:38.794 --> 31:39.727
on the island, Kono; we hunt.

31:39.795 --> 31:41.796
I'm going to need your rifle.

31:51.773 --> 31:54.809
Do I need a lawyer?

31:54.876 --> 31:56.877
Yes.

32:09.719 --> 32:11.748
HPD is holding
Ben Bass

32:11.749 --> 32:13.116
on probable cause.

32:13.184 --> 32:14.951
Unless we can charge him
with Ian's murder,

32:15.019 --> 32:16.452
he's gonna walk in 48 hours.

32:16.520 --> 32:17.987
What about ballistics;
they give us anything?

32:18.055 --> 32:19.355
No. The test
on Ben's rifle

32:19.423 --> 32:20.723
isn't inconclusive.
What about those satellite maps?

32:20.791 --> 32:21.958
There's nothing
showing

32:22.026 --> 32:23.193
the spot where Ben said he was

32:23.260 --> 32:24.260
at the time of the murder.

32:24.328 --> 32:26.696
That doesn't mean he did it.

32:26.764 --> 32:28.064
Doesn't mean he didn't.

32:28.132 --> 32:29.432
Sorry, Kono.

32:30.768 --> 32:32.035
Traced the partial plate

32:32.102 --> 32:33.870
that Kono caught
back to a tour operation

32:33.938 --> 32:35.405
called Katonk Jeep
and Bike Rentals.

32:35.472 --> 32:36.573
Guess who works there.

32:36.640 --> 32:37.607
Who?

32:39.343 --> 32:41.744
Oh, look at that.
Our buddies, Levi and Diego.

32:41.812 --> 32:43.580
Wait a minute.
Don't you guys think

32:43.647 --> 32:45.648
it's a little coincidental
that these guys are trying

32:45.716 --> 32:48.117
to destroy the same land
that Ian was trying to buy?

32:48.185 --> 32:49.953
I think that it warrants
another conversation

32:50.020 --> 32:51.187
at the very least.
Come on.

32:57.194 --> 32:58.428
Diego!

33:00.397 --> 33:01.531
Hey! Hey!

33:22.086 --> 33:23.553
Okay, I got a daughter!

33:25.689 --> 33:26.956
Trust me. I know these roads.

33:27.024 --> 33:30.126
This is not a road!
The road has asphalt. Two lanes.

33:30.194 --> 33:32.829
This is dirt on a trail, okay?
It's a long way down.

33:32.896 --> 33:34.797
Scared?
No, I'm not scared.

33:34.865 --> 33:35.965
I'm rationally concerned!

34:23.313 --> 34:26.081
Hands off the wheel now!

34:29.253 --> 34:30.652
Brah, we never do nothing.

34:30.721 --> 34:32.088
You didn't?
Where'd you get the donut?

34:32.156 --> 34:35.158
My girlfriend got
a little rough last night.

34:35.225 --> 34:37.226
That wasn't your girlfriend,
that was our partner,

34:37.293 --> 34:38.460
and you're lucky
you made it out

34:38.529 --> 34:39.896
of that beach village
with only a mark.

34:39.963 --> 34:42.098
You cops, you can't do nothing.

34:42.166 --> 34:43.933
We're not scared of you.

34:44.001 --> 34:46.069
Now how do you think
that makes me feel?

34:46.136 --> 34:47.136
I mean, here I am,

34:47.204 --> 34:48.571
a duly sworn officer
of the law

34:48.639 --> 34:50.106
and you are showing me
zero respect.

34:50.174 --> 34:52.208
I mean, it's
hurtful, really.

34:56.447 --> 34:58.247
Who's that?

35:00.684 --> 35:03.553
That is someone
you <i>are</i> scared of.

35:12.329 --> 35:14.931
Kawika, we never do nothing.

35:17.935 --> 35:20.370
Thanks for coming all this way,
Kawika.

35:20.437 --> 35:23.306
Tell the <i>haole</i> cop
everything he wants to know.

35:24.808 --> 35:27.043
Who paid you
to burn that village?

35:27.111 --> 35:28.578
Randall.

35:28.645 --> 35:30.546
Randall. Randall who?
Last name?

35:30.614 --> 35:32.115
Barrett.

35:32.182 --> 35:34.517
It's the guy that drives
Carlton Bass around.

35:35.786 --> 35:37.653
How do you know him?

35:37.721 --> 35:39.222
We met him at Koko Head,
shooting.

35:39.289 --> 35:41.324
You met Randall at the rifle range?
Yeah.

35:41.392 --> 35:43.159
Where else you gonna shoot
at Koko Head, huh?

35:43.227 --> 35:45.395
Yes, sir, Mr. Police.

35:45.462 --> 35:48.331
What else can you tell us
about Randall?

35:48.399 --> 35:51.134
We took him to Pupukea.

35:51.201 --> 35:52.635
He said he wanted
a clear shot of Pipeline.

35:55.739 --> 35:57.840
<i>Chin, we got Randall heading</i>
<i>east on Ala Wai Boulevard.</i>

35:57.908 --> 36:00.510
<i>Let's box him in from the west.</i>

36:00.577 --> 36:02.011
<i>Consider him armed</i>
<i>and dangerous.</i>

36:09.486 --> 36:11.354
Randall Barrett,
get out of the car.

36:11.422 --> 36:13.089
Out!

36:13.157 --> 36:14.424
On your knees.

36:14.491 --> 36:16.292
Get down!

36:16.360 --> 36:17.860
Cross your legs.

36:28.005 --> 36:30.339
Steve.
What?

36:30.407 --> 36:32.341
Just a wild guess.
Murder weapon.

36:32.409 --> 36:35.578
It's not that black and white.

36:47.458 --> 36:49.525
Ben, what's going on?

36:49.593 --> 36:52.495
Why did you call me?

36:53.831 --> 36:54.931
Son?

36:58.268 --> 37:00.770
Don't you ever call me
that again.

37:02.506 --> 37:03.606
Ben...

37:03.674 --> 37:05.541
He knows.

37:05.609 --> 37:07.343
What are you talking about?

37:07.411 --> 37:08.644
He knows you had Ian killed.

37:08.712 --> 37:09.846
That's insane.

37:09.913 --> 37:11.247
Carlton Bass,
you're under arrest

37:11.315 --> 37:12.448
for the contract murder

37:12.516 --> 37:14.083
of Ian Adams.

37:14.151 --> 37:15.117
Are you kidding me?

37:15.185 --> 37:16.385
No, he's actually
not kidding.

37:16.453 --> 37:18.955
We have Randall and your two
goons Levi and Diego

37:19.056 --> 37:20.456
in our custody now.

37:20.524 --> 37:21.691
You hired 'em to torch
the beach village,

37:21.758 --> 37:22.725
then set them up for murder,

37:22.793 --> 37:23.960
knowing they had a beef
with Ian.

37:24.027 --> 37:25.361
Yeah, so you're probably not
gonna walk away

37:25.429 --> 37:26.863
free from this one.

37:26.930 --> 37:28.831
So it's my word against that
of my driver and two ex-cons.

37:28.899 --> 37:30.333
You know what?
I'll take my chances.

37:30.400 --> 37:32.268
"I, Ian Adams, hereby bequeath
my ownership stake

37:32.336 --> 37:35.538
"in the Coral Prince Corporation
to my only living relative,

37:35.606 --> 37:38.908
my son, Bennett Bass."

37:44.515 --> 37:46.549
When did you find out
Ian was Ben's father?

37:46.617 --> 37:49.051
Ben said that Ian had been
coming around

37:49.119 --> 37:50.887
trying to get back
in his life.

37:50.954 --> 37:54.023
Did Ben's mom confess to Ian?

37:54.091 --> 37:55.525
Did she tell you?

37:56.460 --> 37:57.860
You had plans
to build

37:57.928 --> 38:00.596
a resort on that beach village
land, but Ian got there first.

38:00.664 --> 38:03.132
He was gonna give
the land to Ben.

38:03.200 --> 38:07.069
But you had him killed before
he could finalize the deal.

38:07.137 --> 38:08.804
Boss, if you wouldn't mind,
I'd like to do the honors.

38:09.873 --> 38:11.407
Book 'im.

38:11.475 --> 38:13.276
Thank you.

38:13.343 --> 38:14.744
I heard that.

38:14.811 --> 38:17.146
Good.
You know,

38:17.214 --> 38:19.649
when I say, "Book 'im, Danno,"
it's a term of endearment.

38:19.716 --> 38:21.817
Okay. Do it every day.
I like it.

38:32.362 --> 38:34.163
I should have
known better

38:34.231 --> 38:35.364
than to suspect you.

38:35.432 --> 38:38.734
You were only doing your job.

38:38.802 --> 38:40.069
<i>Ho'oponopono.</i>

38:41.939 --> 38:43.372
Your forgiveness means
a lot, Ben.

38:43.440 --> 38:45.641
Thank you.

38:49.246 --> 38:51.247
It's up to you now.

38:51.315 --> 38:54.550
Manage the team
and run Coral Prince.

38:54.618 --> 38:57.186
You can do it the way
you always wanted to.

38:57.254 --> 39:00.790
And that's what
Ian wanted.

39:00.857 --> 39:02.124
Ian--

39:02.192 --> 39:04.627
he should be here, you know?

39:04.695 --> 39:06.028
Yeah, I know.

39:06.096 --> 39:07.730
He loved you.

39:07.798 --> 39:11.467
And he's home now, and
that's all that matters.

40:22.339 --> 40:25.474
Whoo!
