WEBVTT

01:17.252 --> 01:21.155
The 308 is a big game
hunting cartridge.

01:21.190 --> 01:23.388
Shooting at a moving
target will be

01:23.423 --> 01:26.391
more difficult than hitting
a stationary target.

01:30.595 --> 01:34.531
Winds are coming in
from the Northwest.

01:34.566 --> 01:37.864
In a 10-mile an
hour wind, that 308

01:37.899 --> 01:41.142
will drift roughly 100
inches at that range.

01:51.583 --> 01:56.784
Control your breathing,
slow it down, and hold.

02:07.500 --> 02:08.499
Now, pull the trigger.

02:13.737 --> 02:18.839
Fifteen inches low
and to the right.

02:31.458 --> 02:34.327
I'm proud of you, TJ.

02:55.482 --> 02:56.844
Don't let him suffer, son.

02:56.879 --> 02:58.549
You have to put him
out of his misery.

04:51.532 --> 04:52.399
Beautiful, isn't it?

04:55.635 --> 04:57.129
It's peaceful.

04:57.164 --> 05:00.374
So is our town, Mr. Harper.

05:00.409 --> 05:02.508
Like I said on the
phone, we may be small,

05:02.543 --> 05:05.478
but we're open for business.

05:05.513 --> 05:08.382
My company has active projects
all across the Midwest,

05:08.417 --> 05:11.847
in Kansas to North Dakota.

05:11.882 --> 05:14.080
We just completed the Bel
Air waterfront development

05:14.115 --> 05:17.523
project in Duluth.

05:17.558 --> 05:21.593
I've talked to the right
people at the state level.

05:21.628 --> 05:23.023
Good.

05:23.058 --> 05:24.959
What troubles me, Mr.
Harper, is the fact

05:24.994 --> 05:27.731
that this great country of
ours elected a president that's

05:27.766 --> 05:30.635
letting the world flood our
market with foreign buyers.

05:33.607 --> 05:39.039
With all due respect,
we're an American company.

05:39.074 --> 05:40.876
We've got over a dozen
development projects

05:40.911 --> 05:42.713
underway right now.

05:42.748 --> 05:45.485
And we pride ourselves in
sustainable infrastructure.

05:48.853 --> 05:51.524
It's the American way.

05:51.559 --> 05:54.021
My office will forward you
the zoning applications

05:54.056 --> 05:55.858
by Wednesday of next week.

05:55.893 --> 05:59.499
In the meantime, I'll make
sure the right people get paid

05:59.534 --> 06:01.028
and the wrong ones
get out of your way.

06:05.573 --> 06:08.937
And the planning committee?

06:08.972 --> 06:10.741
Councilors?

06:10.776 --> 06:14.107
Council is already on our side,
same goes for the deputy mayor.

06:19.521 --> 06:21.488
Economy is in the ship.

06:21.523 --> 06:23.688
That's the good news.

06:23.723 --> 06:25.184
The bad news is that
it's an election.

06:36.868 --> 06:40.540
It's not me you have to
win over, Mr. Harper.

06:40.575 --> 06:42.168
It's the people of
Crawford County.

06:48.649 --> 06:51.584
It's the American way.

06:51.619 --> 06:54.048
Now, this area of farmland
here is a small parcel

06:54.083 --> 06:57.590
of land to the far side
of Big Timber Creek.

06:57.625 --> 07:02.023
As I mentioned, this
proposed development project

07:02.058 --> 07:05.631
is one of the
largest of its kind.

07:05.666 --> 07:07.996
It represents a total
investment in your community

07:08.031 --> 07:09.932
of over $150 million.

07:09.967 --> 07:15.707
So in closing, I'd like to add
that my company's number one

07:15.742 --> 07:19.139
priority is the environment.

07:22.617 --> 07:24.650
This will be the
lasting legacy that we

07:24.685 --> 07:30.282
will leave for those who call
Crawford County their home.

07:30.317 --> 07:35.793
We project phase three to be
completed at the end of 1999,

07:35.828 --> 07:38.664
just under a year from now.

07:38.699 --> 07:43.163
And when we do, we will have
created hundreds of new jobs

07:43.198 --> 07:44.835
right here in this community.

07:44.870 --> 07:45.935
Yeah, for who?

07:45.970 --> 07:47.266
Your own company?

07:47.301 --> 07:49.939
We don't want to lose
any more of our farms.

07:49.974 --> 07:51.578
This town has a lot
of land that can

07:51.613 --> 07:53.976
be used far more efficiently.

07:54.011 --> 07:55.945
And I want to say to
you that in no way

07:55.980 --> 07:58.882
will we compromise the
environment in doing so.

08:01.887 --> 08:03.821
This town has a lot
of land that can

08:03.856 --> 08:05.592
be used far more efficiently.

08:05.627 --> 08:07.627
You should be ashamed of
yourselves for listening

08:07.662 --> 08:08.628
.

08:31.818 --> 08:33.785
Transform your getaway
to a health and wellness

08:33.820 --> 08:36.282
retreat at our lakeside spa.

08:36.317 --> 08:39.219
Where are my sunglasses?

08:39.254 --> 08:42.189
We were supposed to be
in Eagle Bay an hour ago.

08:42.224 --> 08:44.092
So we're already late.

08:44.127 --> 08:45.225
What's a few more minutes?

08:45.260 --> 08:47.898
How did it go?

08:47.933 --> 08:49.999
Like I figured.

08:50.034 --> 08:52.870
At least the
mayor's on our side.

08:52.905 --> 08:55.807
But I tell you, this
small hick town, they're

08:55.842 --> 08:57.974
looking at a gift horse in
the mouth, if you ask me.

09:03.047 --> 09:03.881
What's this?

09:03.916 --> 09:04.684
What's it look like?

09:07.854 --> 09:09.623
It looks like a gift.

09:09.658 --> 09:10.184
Well, open it.

09:13.926 --> 09:15.629
It's a compass.

09:15.664 --> 09:17.697
Something to help you find
your way out there in the world

09:17.732 --> 09:19.732
and to find your way back to me.

09:25.773 --> 09:27.905
How did I ever get
mixed up with you?

09:27.940 --> 09:29.203
Your wife introduced us.

09:29.238 --> 09:29.841
Remember?

09:46.222 --> 09:47.793
Are you trying to kill us?

09:47.828 --> 09:51.830
It's a brand new Trans
Am, 325 ponies, 5.7 liters

09:51.865 --> 09:53.260
of American muscle.

09:53.295 --> 09:57.770
Heading in the wrong
direction of a one-way street.

09:57.805 --> 10:01.972
I can't wait to get away
with you to see that.

10:02.007 --> 10:03.303
Yeah.

10:03.338 --> 10:05.910
I'm looking forward to
a couple of days alone.

10:05.945 --> 10:09.375
No work, no
bureaucrats, no phones.

10:09.410 --> 10:11.410
And no wife.

10:11.445 --> 10:13.819
Don't start with that, Brooke.

10:13.854 --> 10:15.854
I thought we moved past this?

10:15.889 --> 10:17.691
You did.

10:17.726 --> 10:21.024
You're really good
at getting past it.

10:28.033 --> 10:29.395
Yeah.

10:29.430 --> 10:30.099
Yeah.

10:30.134 --> 10:31.034
Buckle up.

10:36.041 --> 10:39.075
Spinning around town
in his automobile.

10:39.110 --> 10:42.045
He decide something
for something to steal.

10:42.080 --> 10:44.784
You better buckle up.

10:44.819 --> 10:46.181
You better buckle up.

10:50.022 --> 10:51.791
Tell the union they
can kiss my ass.

10:54.290 --> 10:57.357
Why don't you get the gas?

10:57.392 --> 10:58.490
Yeah.

11:00.362 --> 11:01.196
No.

11:01.231 --> 11:02.032
No.

11:03.398 --> 11:05.904
I don't care what the
report says.

11:05.939 --> 11:07.400
We've got 20 dump
trucks full of slate,

11:07.435 --> 11:10.106
and they're all backed up.

11:10.141 --> 11:11.811
Yeah.

11:11.846 --> 11:14.110
Well, you tell Grier I want
a face-to-face by Friday.

11:26.993 --> 11:29.323
That's right.

11:39.137 --> 11:41.808
I'm a hard man, more
angles than curves.

11:41.843 --> 11:45.075
You mess with me, you
get what you deserve.

11:45.110 --> 11:47.143
Mister, don't cross that line.

11:50.885 --> 11:54.150
With blue jays and
backwood roots.

11:54.185 --> 11:55.514
You don't want to get with me.

11:59.553 --> 12:01.223
I'll be back in the
office on Monday.

12:01.258 --> 12:02.191
I'll deal with Foster.

12:17.142 --> 12:18.405
Good morning, Sheriff.

12:18.440 --> 12:20.880
Good morning, Russ.

12:20.915 --> 12:23.850
Going fishing today?

12:23.885 --> 12:25.412
If you catch something.

12:44.565 --> 12:46.202
Everything OK?

12:46.237 --> 12:47.973
Fine.

12:48.008 --> 12:51.504
What happened to all that talk
about no phone, no business?

12:51.539 --> 12:53.011
No, I said, no bureaucrats.

13:02.352 --> 13:06.354
That's what I say
until the day I die.

13:45.560 --> 13:47.131
If we're heading
North to Eagle Bay,

13:47.166 --> 13:48.968
shouldn't we've just
stayed on the highway?

13:49.003 --> 13:51.168
Come on and miss all those
beautiful countryside?

13:51.203 --> 13:52.466
Yeah, but that
should be us here.

13:52.501 --> 13:54.204
Why didn't we just
stayed on the highway?

13:54.239 --> 13:55.942
The interstate will
be a parking lot.

13:55.977 --> 13:57.108
This will be faster.

14:15.128 --> 14:16.963
Those assholes from
the gas station.

14:32.277 --> 14:33.914
Good, a cop.

15:06.674 --> 15:08.245
New York plates.

15:08.280 --> 15:11.347
You two lost?

15:11.382 --> 15:13.316
You didn't see that?

15:13.351 --> 15:15.615
See what?

15:15.650 --> 15:17.089
The pickup truck.

15:17.124 --> 15:18.057
They nearly killed us.

15:18.092 --> 15:19.322
They run us off the road.

15:19.357 --> 15:21.258
I guess you didn't see me.

15:21.293 --> 15:23.326
You shot past me up on 48.

15:23.361 --> 15:24.591
Yeah.

15:24.626 --> 15:25.724
Well, I haven't seen
a posted speed limit

15:25.759 --> 15:26.758
in the last few
miles around here.

15:26.793 --> 15:28.232
Can I see your driver's license?

15:46.153 --> 15:47.020
Get out of the car.

15:50.652 --> 15:54.126
What's this about?

15:54.161 --> 15:55.721
I don't know what
you do in New York.

15:55.756 --> 15:57.591
But out here, when
the Sheriff asked

15:57.626 --> 16:00.165
you to get out of the car, you
get the fuck out of the car.

16:00.200 --> 16:02.761
Get out.

16:05.238 --> 16:06.138
You too, princess.

16:06.173 --> 16:07.106
Let's go.

16:11.739 --> 16:13.376
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

16:16.447 --> 16:17.446
Stay over there.

16:17.481 --> 16:18.381
I'm going to search your car.

16:34.828 --> 16:37.103
What are we going to do?

16:42.506 --> 16:43.637
Well, lookie what we have here?

16:43.672 --> 16:44.572
A concealed weapon.

16:47.445 --> 16:49.676
What are you carrying this for?

16:49.711 --> 16:52.118
Protection.

16:52.153 --> 16:53.218
Protection from what?

16:55.750 --> 16:57.189
Paperworks are in the glove box.

16:57.224 --> 16:59.422
It's completely legal.

16:59.457 --> 17:01.061
Not in my County, it's not.

17:06.497 --> 17:07.529
There, that's the truck.

17:55.315 --> 17:56.314
Jesus Christ.

17:56.349 --> 17:57.546
Is this town all crazy?

17:57.581 --> 17:58.679
Calm down.

17:58.714 --> 17:59.713
Calm down?

17:59.748 --> 18:01.154
These rednecks nearly killed us.

18:01.189 --> 18:02.188
You want me to calm down?

18:29.646 --> 18:30.744
This is crazy.

18:30.779 --> 18:33.318
I want to speak
to your superiors.

18:33.353 --> 18:34.649
Open your mouth
one more time, I'm

18:34.684 --> 18:36.288
going to shoot you in the head.

18:38.820 --> 18:41.557
We look like criminals to you?

18:41.592 --> 18:43.955
I don't know what
criminals look like.

18:43.990 --> 18:46.298
How about you fellas?

18:46.333 --> 18:47.464
They look lost to me.

18:51.866 --> 18:54.801
What the hell is going on here?

18:55.804 --> 18:58.442
Raymond Harper, New York.

18:58.477 --> 18:59.938
What do you do for
a living, big shot?

19:02.811 --> 19:05.845
Construction.

19:05.880 --> 19:08.485
What do you build?

19:08.520 --> 19:09.684
We haven't done anything.

19:15.989 --> 19:20.992
Rick, take the Trans Am and
park it up back at the Marina.

19:21.027 --> 19:21.927
We'll meet you there.

19:44.688 --> 19:46.886
Thanks for the short notice.

19:46.921 --> 19:49.922
I wasn't expecting
you until later.

19:49.957 --> 19:51.693
Just make sure
she's all gassed up.

20:01.001 --> 20:02.935
Hey.

20:02.970 --> 20:05.476
Is this even legal?

20:35.805 --> 20:36.969
It's a short walk to the boat.

20:55.363 --> 20:56.362
Holy fuck.

20:56.397 --> 20:58.463
You still got this old tin can?

20:58.498 --> 21:01.433
It maybe old, but
she's still mine.

21:01.468 --> 21:03.798
Does this thing even
going to get us out there?

21:03.833 --> 21:04.832
She'll get us there.

21:04.867 --> 21:05.668
All right.

21:05.703 --> 21:06.735
You two, let's go.

21:06.770 --> 21:07.373
Move it.

21:11.610 --> 21:13.104
Oh, hot blooded.

21:13.139 --> 21:14.413
Just how I like them.

21:43.675 --> 21:44.740
You're feeling all right?

21:47.679 --> 21:49.745
That's how she's
supposed to feel.

21:49.780 --> 21:50.878
She doesn't like the water.

22:04.564 --> 22:06.025
Why are we heading East?

22:06.060 --> 22:08.159
The island's North.

22:08.194 --> 22:09.567
The lake's choppy.

22:09.602 --> 22:10.832
We're going around it.

22:19.711 --> 22:21.414
You don't have the
same last name.

22:23.913 --> 22:25.847
What?

22:25.882 --> 22:29.422
You don't have the
same last name as her.

22:30.854 --> 22:35.593
Oh, your wife doesn't know.

22:35.628 --> 22:38.530
You've been a bad boy, Raymond.

23:26.008 --> 23:27.678
Let's go.

23:27.713 --> 23:29.746
Move, let's go.

23:44.092 --> 23:46.026
You can keep whatever
is in the bag.

23:50.538 --> 23:54.067
Take Gary's patrol car
around back, get it inside.

23:54.102 --> 23:57.939
Same goes for my truck.

23:57.974 --> 24:01.514
Trans Am, take it to Chuck's
directly, get rid of it.

24:01.549 --> 24:03.945
You can keep anything
that's inside.

24:03.980 --> 24:05.518
All right.

24:05.553 --> 24:06.112
Got it?

24:06.147 --> 24:06.816
Yeah.

24:06.851 --> 24:09.016
I got it.

24:25.705 --> 24:27.507
I've been coming here
since I was a kid.

24:30.974 --> 24:33.810
My dad built this place
with his own hands.

24:36.276 --> 24:38.749
Just like owning your
own slice of heaven.

24:41.589 --> 24:42.852
You can't beat it.

25:07.714 --> 25:10.946
What's this?

25:10.981 --> 25:13.982
An extremely expensive watch.

25:14.017 --> 25:15.720
Come on, let us go.

25:15.755 --> 25:19.251
And the watch, the car, I'd
say it's a pretty good deal.

25:22.157 --> 25:23.992
Let you go, just like that?

25:28.834 --> 25:32.704
It doesn't even have
any numbers on it.

25:32.739 --> 25:34.068
How am I supposed
to tell the time?

25:37.843 --> 25:40.877
I think I'll keep my own.

25:40.912 --> 25:46.311
It was a gift from my wife.

25:46.346 --> 25:49.083
I can get you 50,000
by tomorrow night.

25:49.118 --> 25:50.788
Wow.

25:50.823 --> 25:53.219
That's an awful lot of money
for a construction worker.

25:53.254 --> 25:55.661
I'm a land developer.

25:55.696 --> 25:58.631
And is that what this is about?

25:58.666 --> 26:00.699
Kidnapping?

26:00.734 --> 26:02.360
What will it take?

26:02.395 --> 26:04.604
100,000?

26:23.416 --> 26:25.053
Are you going to tell
us what you want?

26:25.088 --> 26:26.153
Just keep your mouth shut.

26:27.827 --> 26:29.288
You, sit down.

26:53.017 --> 26:55.083
You will behave yourselves.

26:55.118 --> 26:59.725
If you don't, we're not
going to be nice anymore.

26:59.760 --> 27:01.925
And we're going to
hurt you real bad.

27:18.878 --> 27:21.274
Sit your ass back
down in that chair.

27:35.158 --> 27:36.894
That's some woman you
got there, Raymond.

27:37.391 --> 27:38.764
Strong.

27:38.799 --> 27:42.295
Nearly put it through the table.

27:42.330 --> 27:45.804
You better not hurt her.

27:45.839 --> 27:46.431
Or what?

27:50.272 --> 27:52.107
What are you going to do next?

27:52.142 --> 27:53.009
Rape me?

27:55.541 --> 27:59.477
We're hunters not animals.

27:59.512 --> 28:01.512
And married, sweetheart.

28:01.547 --> 28:04.185
Not that that means
anything to you.

28:04.220 --> 28:06.220
There is no escape.

28:06.255 --> 28:07.892
You'll know why
you're here tomorrow.

28:24.075 --> 28:24.777
Cuff yourself.

28:32.017 --> 28:34.512
Stop sandbagging it, honey.

28:34.547 --> 28:38.186
Hurry up.

29:18.393 --> 29:20.833
How's the arm?

29:20.868 --> 29:22.164
How do you think?

29:22.199 --> 29:24.331
She put a fucking
knife through it.

29:24.366 --> 29:25.497
Could have been worse.

29:35.982 --> 29:37.278
I'm in.

29:37.313 --> 29:39.577
You guys hear about the
mine in Jackson closing?

29:44.485 --> 29:49.290
Chappie, he was a foreman
up there, wasn't he?

29:49.325 --> 29:50.456
That's right.

29:50.491 --> 29:52.590
Gone.

29:52.625 --> 29:54.966
They retired him.

29:55.001 --> 29:55.967
That's two to you, TJ.

30:00.072 --> 30:02.567
I'm in.

30:02.602 --> 30:05.108
That's not what happened.

30:05.143 --> 30:06.637
What'd you hear?

30:06.672 --> 30:07.913
It's not what I heard.

30:07.948 --> 30:11.015
It's what I know.

30:11.050 --> 30:14.018
He spent his whole
life down in that mine.

30:14.053 --> 30:17.615
You guys should know better than
anyone, under ground for that

30:17.650 --> 30:18.253
long.

30:22.622 --> 30:24.556
Is this something
to do with your job?

30:24.591 --> 30:26.932
Development projects
up in this area?

30:26.967 --> 30:29.363
It has to be.

30:29.398 --> 30:30.661
I've made enemies
over the years,

30:30.696 --> 30:32.069
but not that want to kill me.

30:34.370 --> 30:36.942
Why do you carry a gun?

30:36.977 --> 30:38.108
I don't carry it.

30:38.143 --> 30:41.177
I keep it in the
car for protection.

30:41.212 --> 30:42.475
It's a last resort.

30:42.510 --> 30:44.213
I'd say this is a last resort.

30:44.248 --> 30:46.479
Why didn't you use it earlier?

30:46.514 --> 30:47.183
On a cop?

30:56.656 --> 31:01.527
And what the hell is a uniformed
cop doing involved in this?

31:01.562 --> 31:02.968
They want money.

31:03.003 --> 31:05.069
Just give it to them.

31:05.104 --> 31:06.598
I handed him a gold watch.

31:06.633 --> 31:08.270
He threw it away
like it was nothing.

31:11.407 --> 31:13.110
No.

31:13.145 --> 31:15.145
If this is about money,
they would have said so.

31:20.119 --> 31:21.646
Ransom.

31:21.681 --> 31:25.452
Maybe they're going to ransom
you like a kidnapping plot.

31:25.487 --> 31:26.519
Who would bring us here?

31:26.554 --> 31:27.993
This place-- look at this place.

31:28.028 --> 31:30.259
It's got no power,
no phone, nothing.

31:33.726 --> 31:34.428
I'm scared.

31:37.268 --> 31:38.432
I am so scared.

31:52.679 --> 31:55.350
Two.

31:55.385 --> 31:58.419
Housing costs are going up.

31:58.454 --> 32:01.994
All the city folk
are moving this way.

32:02.029 --> 32:03.655
I check.

32:05.098 --> 32:06.691
It's no sweat off
your balls, Gary.

32:06.726 --> 32:09.331
You landed yourself
a government job.

32:09.366 --> 32:13.269
I left Detroit for a reason,
not to work my ass off swimming

32:13.304 --> 32:15.700
in all that human garbage.

32:15.735 --> 32:17.075
It's a fucking war zone.

32:17.110 --> 32:19.011
It always has been.

32:19.046 --> 32:20.408
Back when I was at
the 5th precinct,

32:20.443 --> 32:21.508
there was a murder a night.

32:30.585 --> 32:34.686
Sometimes I just pray for it.

32:34.721 --> 32:35.654
Raise three.

32:37.295 --> 32:39.229
Pray for what?

32:39.264 --> 32:42.199
Society to fall apart.

32:42.234 --> 32:45.367
I mean, really fall apart.

32:45.402 --> 32:47.402
No cops, no law.

32:50.737 --> 32:53.177
Maybe we need a reset.

32:53.212 --> 32:54.739
Personally, I
thought the Russkies

32:54.774 --> 32:57.511
would have invaded by now.

32:57.546 --> 33:00.052
What do you think, Gary?

33:00.087 --> 33:01.416
About what?

33:01.451 --> 33:03.550
Moving further North.

33:03.585 --> 33:05.783
You got rocks in your head?

33:05.818 --> 33:08.390
Any further North
would be in the lake.

33:08.425 --> 33:09.358
I ain't going anywhere.

33:09.393 --> 33:10.260
I'll die here.

33:16.598 --> 33:19.665
Up to 10 bucks to you, Rick.

33:19.700 --> 33:21.436
Interesting.

33:21.471 --> 33:22.404
I raise 30 bucks.

33:24.837 --> 33:26.672
If I catch you cheating
one more time, Rick,

33:26.707 --> 33:28.773
I'm going to shove this
deck up your fucking ass.

33:37.487 --> 33:39.718
We're drifting
North of the Marina.

33:39.753 --> 33:41.060
I'd say two or three miles.

33:43.427 --> 33:44.327
How do you know that?

33:49.169 --> 33:51.664
Average speed of a boat is
about 30 minutes per mile,

33:51.699 --> 33:53.732
maybe more.

33:57.342 --> 33:58.836
We took just over an hour
and a half to get here.

33:58.871 --> 34:00.145
So--

34:01.874 --> 34:03.478
How are we going
to get out of here?

34:06.912 --> 34:08.549
We do what they say.

34:08.584 --> 34:10.749
That seems to be working
real good so far.

34:10.784 --> 34:13.719
If we don't think of
something, we're in trouble.

34:13.754 --> 34:17.195
What do you want us to do?

34:17.230 --> 34:20.792
Our car is probably sitting at
the bottom of the lake by now.

34:20.827 --> 34:22.860
They have all the guns.

34:22.895 --> 34:24.697
We don't know where we are.

34:24.732 --> 34:28.338
There's no radio or
telephone that we know of.

34:28.373 --> 34:29.273
One of them is a cop.

34:34.412 --> 34:35.411
And then there's you.

34:38.383 --> 34:39.580
What about me?

34:42.222 --> 34:43.320
Everyone knows you're here.

34:59.338 --> 35:01.173
What are you doing?

35:01.208 --> 35:01.602
Hey.

35:01.637 --> 35:02.372
Get up.

35:03.639 --> 35:04.242
Hey.

35:04.673 --> 35:05.540
Ray.

35:37.673 --> 35:40.311
Please, we haven't
done anything.

35:42.348 --> 35:44.975
Does this have something
to do with Ray's work?

35:45.010 --> 35:46.383
My family has no money.

35:50.785 --> 35:51.949
I don't deserve to be here.

35:55.922 --> 36:00.958
If you're going to tell
me your whole life story,

36:00.993 --> 36:02.663
why don't you sit down.

36:11.905 --> 36:12.574
I insist.

36:28.526 --> 36:29.393
Why are we here?

36:33.025 --> 36:34.695
What the hell is going on here?

36:37.502 --> 36:38.369
I want to leave.

36:59.425 --> 37:02.624
You're free to go.

37:02.659 --> 37:03.658
That's not what I meant.

37:08.335 --> 37:09.565
Call Ray's wife.

37:09.600 --> 37:10.269
She'll pay.

37:13.967 --> 37:16.539
Not when she finds out you've
been banging her old man.

38:23.102 --> 38:24.904
How about a dance, sweetheart?

38:30.813 --> 38:33.814
She don't like you, Gary.

38:33.849 --> 38:38.588
Maybe she's too good
for your country ass.

38:38.623 --> 38:39.985
Why don't you like me?

38:47.159 --> 38:50.028
Oh, you smell so nice.

39:24.504 --> 39:26.438
What the hell you're
doing with that little gun

39:26.473 --> 39:27.472
up here for anyway?

39:30.235 --> 39:33.676
Pulled it out lock up
about two years ago.

39:33.711 --> 39:38.483
Some gangbanger got lit up on
52nd street in the West Side.

39:38.518 --> 39:40.617
I read the report too.

39:40.652 --> 39:44.588
Witnesses say it looks like
he was dancing the jig.

39:46.185 --> 39:48.922
Today's the day that I get to
watch someone dance exactly

39:48.957 --> 39:51.760
like that little greaseball did.

40:16.754 --> 40:20.756
You finally going to tell us
what you plan on doing with us?

40:20.791 --> 40:22.758
What's it look like?

40:22.793 --> 40:23.825
They're going to hunt us.

40:27.127 --> 40:27.730
What?

40:31.131 --> 40:32.834
You expect us to
just walk out of here

40:32.869 --> 40:35.969
so you can hunt us down?

40:36.004 --> 40:37.872
No gun.

40:37.907 --> 40:40.204
If you keep your wits about
you, and you might make it out

40:40.239 --> 40:42.107
alive.

40:42.142 --> 40:45.781
And you never know, you
might wind up killing us.

40:45.816 --> 40:46.485
With what?

40:57.124 --> 41:01.698
Rick, Gary, and I used to go
hunting up near Buck's Bay.

41:01.733 --> 41:03.799
We went for years.

41:03.834 --> 41:07.737
A hundred white tails,
wild boar, but the outcome

41:07.772 --> 41:09.673
was always the same.

41:09.708 --> 41:14.579
Like my father always said,
once you've hunted men,

41:14.614 --> 41:19.309
animals just don't
cut it anymore.

41:19.344 --> 41:21.619
You're going to feel
a rush of adrenaline

41:21.654 --> 41:24.853
like you've never
experienced before.

41:24.888 --> 41:30.958
All your natural instincts to
survive are going to take over.

41:30.993 --> 41:34.731
You're going to feel more
alive in the next few hours

41:34.766 --> 41:39.065
and then all those wasted years.

41:39.100 --> 41:44.642
This island is three miles
from shore to shore surrounded

41:44.677 --> 41:47.337
by water in all directions.

41:47.372 --> 41:50.241
There's no way off this rock.

41:50.276 --> 41:54.179
Even we can't leave not until
morning when the boat arrives.

41:54.214 --> 41:56.588
Please, don't do this.

41:56.623 --> 41:57.589
Start running.

42:23.243 --> 42:28.180
I can't go.

42:32.758 --> 42:33.284
We have to move.

42:33.319 --> 42:34.153
We can't stop.

42:34.188 --> 42:37.255
If we stop, we die.

42:37.290 --> 42:39.059
What do you figure?

42:39.094 --> 42:40.962
Four hours tops.

42:43.428 --> 42:45.901
Remember that
couple from Florida?

42:45.936 --> 42:50.037
That was a complete wash out
My balls barely broke a sweat.

42:50.072 --> 42:52.270
Yeah, TJ got the first kill.

42:52.305 --> 42:53.942
He got lucky.

42:53.977 --> 42:55.680
The wife was the
size of a truck.

42:55.715 --> 42:57.946
You and I flushed
it right toward him.

42:57.981 --> 42:59.816
You're getting old, Rick.

42:59.851 --> 43:03.182
You couldn't catch her
today if you tried.

43:18.903 --> 43:21.167
Squeeze in a little bit.

43:21.202 --> 43:23.070
Why?

43:23.105 --> 43:24.137
For Luann and the kids.

43:39.891 --> 43:40.956
Are you OK?

43:40.991 --> 43:42.419
I'm not OK.

43:42.454 --> 43:44.190
None of this is OK.

43:48.262 --> 43:49.230
Why us?

43:53.102 --> 43:54.167
Why us?

43:58.338 --> 44:00.272
It doesn't matter now.

44:00.307 --> 44:02.208
If we just do this, we'll
figure it out later.

44:02.243 --> 44:03.847
Yes.

44:03.882 --> 44:05.013
Come on.

44:05.048 --> 44:05.475
Let's go.

44:05.510 --> 44:06.278
Up.

44:06.313 --> 44:07.312
Let's go.

44:07.347 --> 44:08.753
Up, up.

44:29.809 --> 44:32.777
What do you figure?

44:32.812 --> 44:34.504
I don't.

44:34.539 --> 44:36.979
They're going to go straight
in until they hit the water

44:37.014 --> 44:40.246
and double back
the way they came.

44:40.281 --> 44:42.512
I don't think so.

44:42.547 --> 44:45.988
I bet they run straight up
the blind side of the lake.

44:46.023 --> 44:48.859
Follow it right around.

44:48.894 --> 44:49.827
Not a chance.

44:49.862 --> 44:52.357
Ten bucks says you're wrong.

44:52.392 --> 44:54.898
I'll take that bet.

45:04.470 --> 45:05.304
Over there.

45:10.916 --> 45:11.541
Where?

45:11.576 --> 45:13.213
Over there.

45:13.248 --> 45:15.149
Are you sure?

45:15.184 --> 45:16.249
I don't see anything.

45:23.093 --> 45:25.225
Never mind.

45:25.260 --> 45:26.259
OK.

45:26.294 --> 45:30.032
Split up no more than 100 yards.

45:30.067 --> 45:32.529
If you see something, fire
a single shot in the air.

45:32.564 --> 45:35.004
The other two will come running.

45:35.039 --> 45:36.566
Sounds good to me.

45:36.601 --> 45:37.875
What do you say, Rick?

45:41.474 --> 45:44.277
I'm OK with that.

46:30.292 --> 46:33.425
We've got to get
back to the cabin.

46:33.460 --> 46:35.966
There's going to be a
gun, a knife, anything.

46:36.001 --> 46:36.967
No.

46:37.002 --> 46:38.331
They won't be expecting it.

46:38.366 --> 46:39.233
No.

46:39.268 --> 46:39.871
Please.

46:59.123 --> 47:00.287
I hear them.

47:03.061 --> 47:03.455
Hide.

47:38.591 --> 47:40.492
They're coming.

47:40.527 --> 47:42.428
Listen to me.

47:42.463 --> 47:45.101
You've got to get out of here.

47:45.136 --> 47:49.072
Run and hide as fast as you can.

47:49.107 --> 47:50.238
Please, go.

49:21.100 --> 49:22.066
Gary.

50:14.681 --> 50:16.582
They got my fucking gun.

50:16.617 --> 50:18.782
Oh, well that's just great.

50:18.817 --> 50:21.092
What do you think of
the odds now, Gary?

50:21.127 --> 50:22.489
Fuck you, Rick.

50:22.524 --> 50:23.424
Now, they're armed.

50:26.165 --> 50:28.396
It doesn't change a thing.

50:28.431 --> 50:29.826
There's the three of us.

50:29.861 --> 50:31.696
We know the terrain.

50:31.731 --> 50:38.406
Besides, if it was too easy,
where would the fun be?

50:38.441 --> 50:40.606
They got you good.

50:40.641 --> 50:43.543
You could fuck off too.

50:43.578 --> 50:45.149
You're lucky.

50:45.184 --> 50:47.712
I'm hit plenty of times,
never felt lucky about it.

51:09.538 --> 51:10.636
Is that a gun?

51:15.841 --> 51:16.642
I'm so sorry.

51:23.750 --> 51:24.617
I should be here.

51:27.886 --> 51:29.424
You should be home.

51:33.694 --> 51:34.396
I'm sorry.

51:37.698 --> 51:39.599
No.

51:39.634 --> 51:40.567
No.

51:43.440 --> 51:44.406
There's nothing ever
you feel sorry about.

51:48.214 --> 51:49.609
For everything else.

52:33.424 --> 52:34.654
They're coming.

52:34.689 --> 52:35.292
Run.

52:39.562 --> 52:39.956
Run.

53:30.008 --> 53:30.677
Run.

53:49.368 --> 53:49.894
Whoa.

53:49.929 --> 53:51.863
Whoa.

53:51.898 --> 53:53.634
God damn, what a rush.

53:57.640 --> 53:59.002
Here, take that.

54:06.517 --> 54:07.846
Get my good side.

54:07.881 --> 54:09.320
But you don't have a good side.

54:17.363 --> 54:19.429
Make sure I get a set of prints.

54:24.667 --> 54:26.997
We got a live one here.

54:27.032 --> 54:27.635
Yeah.

54:30.035 --> 54:32.805
That's 10 bucks you owe me.

54:32.840 --> 54:34.774
Best 10 bucks I ever spent.

54:39.385 --> 54:40.450
Adios.

54:40.485 --> 54:41.385
No.

54:45.589 --> 54:46.390
He's mine.

57:11.229 --> 57:14.637
I think I hit her, 50
meters straight ahead.

57:14.672 --> 57:15.066
Rick.

57:29.951 --> 57:31.522
I think I hit her.

57:31.557 --> 57:34.525
She's got to be close.

57:34.560 --> 57:37.561
Did either of you see
which way she went?

57:37.596 --> 57:39.189
I didn't see shit.

57:39.224 --> 57:42.896
Wow, you were the
one who shot her.

57:42.931 --> 57:45.635
Start a skirmish
line, 50 feet apart.

57:45.670 --> 57:48.198
We'll head straight
down to the water.

57:48.233 --> 57:51.872
Remember, she's got Gary's gun.

57:51.907 --> 57:54.611
It's got to be out
of ammo by now.

57:54.646 --> 57:55.711
Don't bet on it.

1:00:14.016 --> 1:00:14.410
Stop.

1:00:25.324 --> 1:00:27.291
I thought I heard something.

1:00:41.208 --> 1:00:41.943
No, forget it.

1:02:41.295 --> 1:02:43.460
If anyone hear me,
please, I need help.

1:02:43.495 --> 1:02:45.594
This is an emergency.

1:02:45.629 --> 1:02:46.463
Is anyone there?

1:03:01.986 --> 1:03:03.018
BROOKE Hello.

1:03:06.518 --> 1:03:08.452
Is anyone there?

1:03:08.487 --> 1:03:09.618
Please help me.

1:03:09.653 --> 1:03:12.027
I've been kidnapped
by three men.

1:03:12.062 --> 1:03:13.028
- Damn it.

1:03:13.063 --> 1:03:14.557
BROOKE Help me.

1:03:14.592 --> 1:03:15.195
Cap.

1:03:30.641 --> 1:03:32.047
What's the range on that thing?

1:03:32.082 --> 1:03:33.444
How the fuck should I know?

1:04:47.619 --> 1:04:48.486
Backroom is clear.

1:04:54.593 --> 1:04:55.460
It's clear.

1:04:55.495 --> 1:04:57.066
She's gone.

1:04:57.101 --> 1:04:58.199
Rick, she's got your rifle.

1:05:21.389 --> 1:05:24.423
There's no way she can
get off the island, right?

1:05:24.458 --> 1:05:26.524
You've been hunting
five years here, Gary.

1:05:30.233 --> 1:05:33.135
You know there's
no way off of here.

1:05:33.170 --> 1:05:34.433
Not unless she swims.

1:05:41.244 --> 1:05:42.672
Impossible.

1:05:42.707 --> 1:05:46.445
It's 20 miles from this
island to the mainland.

1:05:46.480 --> 1:05:49.349
An average male with good
shape could probably do what?

1:05:49.384 --> 1:05:50.482
Three miles, tops.

1:05:54.323 --> 1:05:57.291
She's alone, and she's scared.

1:05:57.326 --> 1:05:59.491
There's no way she's
getting out of here.

1:06:28.291 --> 1:06:32.029
Bitch is bleeding.

1:06:46.672 --> 1:06:47.737
We got more over here.

1:06:56.682 --> 1:06:58.319
We need to put her
out of her misery.

1:07:30.386 --> 1:07:32.221
What are the odds of
someone seeing that?

1:08:03.320 --> 1:08:03.714
Hold up.

1:08:18.962 --> 1:08:19.664
What the fuck?

1:08:26.277 --> 1:08:27.441
What the hell is it?

1:08:38.322 --> 1:08:39.684
Fuck this.

1:08:52.567 --> 1:08:54.897
Fuck this.

1:08:54.932 --> 1:08:57.504
Fuck.

1:08:57.539 --> 1:09:00.804
Fuck it.

1:09:00.839 --> 1:09:01.574
Stay down.

1:09:01.609 --> 1:09:02.542
Fuck.

1:09:02.577 --> 1:09:04.181
Get me out of here, TJ.

1:09:06.614 --> 1:09:09.648
Oh, my God damn leg.

1:09:10.387 --> 1:09:10.847
Stay down.

1:09:17.592 --> 1:09:21.429
You got-- you got
to help me, man.

1:09:29.769 --> 1:09:32.935
I got something for you.

1:09:36.578 --> 1:09:38.512
Rick, hold on.

1:09:38.547 --> 1:09:40.514
You got to help me, man.

1:09:40.549 --> 1:09:41.845
S

1:09:47.424 --> 1:09:47.884
You got--

1:10:02.934 --> 1:10:05.935
Oh, my God damn legs.

1:10:05.970 --> 1:10:08.036
Stop moving.

1:10:08.071 --> 1:10:12.040
Gary, get the hell out
there and grab Rick.

1:10:12.075 --> 1:10:13.712
I'm not going out there.

1:10:13.747 --> 1:10:16.319
I'm hit!

1:10:16.354 --> 1:10:17.749
Oh, my God.

1:10:17.784 --> 1:10:18.783
Help me!

1:10:33.866 --> 1:10:34.832
Oh, God.

1:11:16.381 --> 1:11:18.711
Grab that medical kit.

1:11:18.746 --> 1:11:19.481
Fuck.

1:11:19.516 --> 1:11:20.416
It's empty.

1:11:20.451 --> 1:11:21.615
What?

1:11:21.650 --> 1:11:23.782
It's fucking empty.

1:11:27.458 --> 1:11:28.919
God damn it, Rick.

1:11:28.954 --> 1:11:29.986
Hang in there.

1:11:30.021 --> 1:11:31.823
Don't you die on me.

1:11:35.125 --> 1:11:36.861
I'm going to fix you up.

1:11:36.896 --> 1:11:37.499
Whiskey.

1:11:48.479 --> 1:11:50.974
You remember that time that
you rolled your sister's car

1:11:51.009 --> 1:11:52.844
off the road.

1:11:52.879 --> 1:11:56.078
You went right through
that damn windshield.

1:11:56.113 --> 1:11:59.620
You're invincible.

1:11:59.655 --> 1:12:00.984
Don't leave me.

1:12:01.019 --> 1:12:02.821
We can't do anything
until we kill

1:12:02.856 --> 1:12:05.758
that bitch that fucked you up.

1:12:05.793 --> 1:12:07.793
It doesn't look so bad, Rick.

1:12:07.828 --> 1:12:09.927
You knew that she
would start shooting.

1:12:09.962 --> 1:12:11.060
You saved her own skin.

1:12:13.801 --> 1:12:17.000
Don't tell Luann.

1:12:17.035 --> 1:12:17.902
Stop talking.

1:12:17.937 --> 1:12:18.738
I can't--

1:12:18.773 --> 1:12:19.442
Save your energy.

1:12:19.477 --> 1:12:20.135
I can't--

1:12:20.170 --> 1:12:20.806
I'm going to fix you up.

1:12:38.925 --> 1:12:41.431
Is anyone there?

1:12:41.466 --> 1:12:42.091
Can anyone hear me?

1:12:42.126 --> 1:12:43.961
Please, I need help.

1:12:47.131 --> 1:12:49.131
We say it was a
hunting accident.

1:12:49.166 --> 1:12:51.870
He's been shot a dozen times.

1:12:51.905 --> 1:12:53.608
We were drinking.

1:12:53.643 --> 1:12:57.744
He went out at night, never
returned, probably drowned.

1:12:57.779 --> 1:13:00.076
I'm still alive you, assholes.

1:13:00.111 --> 1:13:02.177
We're talking about the
worst case scenario, Rick.

1:13:05.787 --> 1:13:08.216
I don't feel so well.

1:13:08.251 --> 1:13:10.955
That nosy wife of his is
going to ask questions.

1:13:10.990 --> 1:13:13.188
The Sheriff's Department is
going to ask questions too.

1:13:13.223 --> 1:13:14.695
Nothing we can't handle.

1:13:14.730 --> 1:13:16.499
But Luann, she's not
going to let this go.

1:13:19.669 --> 1:13:21.097
BROOKE
Can anyone hear me?

1:13:21.132 --> 1:13:23.099
This is an emergency.

1:13:23.134 --> 1:13:26.542
I'm on an island somewhere
near Oakland County.

1:13:26.577 --> 1:13:29.578
One of them is a police officer.

1:13:29.613 --> 1:13:31.008
Is anyone out there?

1:13:31.043 --> 1:13:33.549
Please respond.

1:13:33.584 --> 1:13:35.650
What about plan B?

1:13:35.685 --> 1:13:37.982
Plan B should have
happened hours ago.

1:13:44.760 --> 1:13:47.057
You take this.

1:13:47.092 --> 1:13:49.191
You kill anyone that
comes through that door.

1:13:55.540 --> 1:13:56.506
Except me or Gary.

1:14:23.931 --> 1:14:25.865
What are you going
to tell your wife?

1:14:25.900 --> 1:14:27.163
I haven't though about it.

1:14:27.198 --> 1:14:30.067
We need get our story straight.

1:14:30.102 --> 1:14:31.233
You all right?

1:14:31.268 --> 1:14:33.642
Yeah.

1:14:33.677 --> 1:14:35.611
We've known Rick a long time.

1:14:35.646 --> 1:14:38.812
If he survives this, we're
going to have to put him down.

1:14:41.784 --> 1:14:43.179
Those wounds are
going to require

1:14:43.214 --> 1:14:46.314
an awful lot of explaining.

1:14:46.349 --> 1:14:49.152
Where the hell are you going?

1:14:49.187 --> 1:14:50.186
Figure it my way.

1:16:47.877 --> 1:16:48.271
Get up.

1:17:08.161 --> 1:17:09.292
What are you going to do?

1:17:29.787 --> 1:17:31.886
I'm going to get
even for the arm.

1:17:31.921 --> 1:17:33.822
We'll carve up this
pretty little face.

1:19:25.364 --> 1:19:26.462
Where's Gary?

1:19:30.204 --> 1:19:31.368
I'm so cold.

1:19:51.995 --> 1:19:53.863
You'll get me off this
island, yeah, Teej?

1:19:56.527 --> 1:19:58.527
Yeah.

1:19:58.562 --> 1:20:00.331
I'm getting you off the island.

1:20:00.366 --> 1:20:02.201
I'm so cold.

1:20:02.236 --> 1:20:02.839
Fuck.

1:24:39.909 --> 1:24:41.612
Remember what I taught you, TJ.

1:25:37.307 --> 1:25:38.669
How the hell did you get--

1:25:38.704 --> 1:25:39.703
Held my breath.

1:25:48.912 --> 1:25:50.714
You cunt.

1:26:46.805 --> 1:26:47.870
It wasn't personal.
