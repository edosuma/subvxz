they're not welcome here.

Nancy, you do not have

Make that happen,

But remember, for the sanctity
of the position,

Tell no one.

That won't be an issue.

08:29.890 --> 08:32.760
You're dashing my dreams,

09:20.120 --> 09:23.640
- You would have made such
an incredible Mother Courage.

09:23.840 --> 09:25.780
- I know.
- You'll shine in any role.

09:25.980 --> 09:28.580
- You have the range.
- I know. It's just--

09:28.780 --> 09:29.980
[sighs]

09:30.180 --> 09:33.620
"R&J," it's trite.

09:33.820 --> 09:35.590
Maybe it won't be so bad.

09:35.790 --> 09:36.820
Romeo seems like
a real nosebleed,

09:37.020 --> 09:39.090
but this Mar-cuttio guy
seems cool.

09:39.290 --> 09:41.260
That's Floyd's role.

09:41.460 --> 09:43.100
Don't we have to audition?

09:43.300 --> 09:45.060
As a formality.

09:45.260 --> 09:47.670
But we all know how
this is going to go.

09:47.870 --> 09:50.240
I will play Juliet,
Arthur will be Romeo,

09:50.440 --> 09:54.760
and Floyd will be Mercutio.

09:56.390 --> 09:59.180
And the rest will
be...

09:59.380 --> 10:00.210
peasants.

- But that certainly
increased the tensions

10:11.310 --> 10:13.730
among the colonists, truly
infuriating the colonists.

10:13.930 --> 10:14.930
They were mad at the king,

10:15.130 --> 10:16.660
so they threw
all their tea overboard,

10:16.860 --> 10:18.100
which is so childish,
if you ask me.

10:18.300 --> 10:19.770
*

10:19.970 --> 10:21.070
Not that I'm complaining,

10:21.270 --> 10:23.840
but what happened
to your jacket?

10:24.040 --> 10:25.740
- It's at the
Mind Your Own Business Bureau.

10:25.940 --> 10:28.070
- You should visit.
- [chuckles] No, thanks.

10:28.270 --> 10:29.340

the view here.

Be a gentleman.

10:45.770 --> 10:47.660
Mr. Ford, can I go next?

10:47.860 --> 10:49.730
Not in that, you can't.

10:49.930 --> 10:53.930
- I'm wearing the same thing
as Polly.

10:54.130 --> 10:58.140
- Not in the same way.
It's distracting to the boys.

10:58.340 --> 11:00.170
To the principal's office,
please.

11:00.370 --> 11:02.880

on this stupid sweater.

14:18.700 --> 14:19.870
It's so unfair!

14:20.070 --> 14:21.570
This paper is spreading lies
about us,

14:21.770 --> 14:25.080
and I'm not leaving until you
agree to print a retraction.

14:25.280 --> 14:26.440
- We're too busy
for retractions.

14:26.640 --> 14:28.110
- We're late
on printing today's paper.

14:28.310 --> 14:29.560
- Besides, Ernie wrote
a first-rate article.

14:30.800 --> 14:32.300
He interviewed eyewitnesses,
spoke with the administration.

14:33.300 --> 14:35.990

They have it out for us.

at least let me
write a response.

- You?

can write for the paper,

application process.

We need the help.

they wanted to vote for us

of impartiality,

we will be instituting
a brand-new,

Effective tomorrow,

boys will be required to wear
long-sleeved button-up shirts.

heard my angle.

That's why I ran it.

19:29.960 --> 19:30.650
But "The Rydell Review"
isn't your personal bullhorn.

19:30.850 --> 19:32.350
- What about
the First Amendment?

19:32.550 --> 19:33.690
This is censorship.

- [sighs] It's high school.
You're teenagers.

19:37.460 --> 19:39.820
You don't have any rights
or power.

19:40.020 --> 19:42.440
Yeah, I'm aware.

No, thanks.

20:22.670 --> 20:24.440
I'm sorry.
This is not working.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.500
All I can think about is how
it's so unfair

20:26.700 --> 20:28.210
that everyone's blaming us
for everything

20:28.410 --> 20:30.510
and how I'll probably
get detention for cutting,

20:30.710 --> 20:32.380
and then I'll have another mark
on my permanent record,

20:32.580 --> 20:34.280
and then I'll never
get to go to college.

20:34.480 --> 20:37.380

were supportive.

you explained it all to me.

not play the starring role.

Look, do what you want,

The spotlight's
just not for me.

31:37.510 --> 31:39.440
- But you looked great up there.
- Okay.

31:39.640 --> 31:40.910
Good luck.

31:41.110 --> 31:43.580
Thank you.

- Gregory?
The servant?

Friar John?

32:03.170 --> 32:04.440
Kill me.

32:04.640 --> 32:07.600
- This is all your fault.
Why can't you just act nice?

32:07.800 --> 32:11.060
- [chuckles] She'll have to,
to play the nurse.

32:17.600 --> 32:19.080
Juliet?

32:19.280 --> 32:21.990
Is this a joke?
I wanted Mar-cuttio!

32:22.190 --> 32:24.990
[sighs]

32:25.190 --> 32:26.540
Mercutio.

32:29.710 --> 32:33.130
A tomboy Juliet!

32:33.330 --> 32:36.230
A maimed Romeo!

32:36.430 --> 32:41.170
We are really going to shake
things up around here yet.

32:41.370 --> 32:43.010
Wait, really?

32:43.210 --> 32:44.680
I got it?

32:44.880 --> 32:46.310
[softly] Yeah.

33:05.380 --> 33:08.030
Gosh, you work fast.

33:08.230 --> 33:09.400
- Mr. Daniels
already approved it.

33:09.600 --> 33:10.670
Off to print.

[crowd cheering]

33:13.400 --> 33:14.510
[marching band playing]

33:14.710 --> 33:16.470
- It's a beautiful day
on the Titans home field

33:16.670 --> 33:20.280
as the Titans square off
against the Rydell Rangers.

33:20.480 --> 33:23.280
Now, the Titans are currently
undefeated on the season

33:23.480 --> 33:26.080
and are on a direct path
to the championship.

33:26.280 --> 33:31.490
- No flasks, no bullhorns,
no whistles, no jackets.

33:31.690 --> 33:33.190
Today, we show everyone

33:33.390 --> 33:36.630
there is no place
for delinquency at Rydell.

33:36.830 --> 33:40.400
- [mocking] So put that up your
delinquent butts and smoke it.

Hey.

33:55.780 --> 33:56.760
Stupid dress code.

33:57.730 --> 33:59.150
Is it really gonna be
like this all year?

33:59.350 --> 34:01.650
- I think things
are gonna change soon.

34:01.850 --> 34:04.420
- Where's Nancy?
- She hates football, remember?

34:04.620 --> 34:05.560
Oh.

He's a quarterback.

the Titans score a touchdown.

35:06.380 --> 35:07.580
- Yeah!
Let's go!

35:07.780 --> 35:10.650
- Not a great start for
Rydell's newest quarterback,

35:10.850 --> 35:14.060
making it Titans 6,
Rangers 0.

35:14.260 --> 35:15.730

We can still win!

35:21.700 --> 35:22.850
I think!

35:23.980 --> 35:25.770
I do not know the rules
of football, nor do I care to!

Hut!

35:27.370 --> 35:32.180
*

35:32.380 --> 35:34.180
- Another hesitation
from Rydell,

35:34.380 --> 35:36.180
and the Titans
aren't letting it slide.

35:36.380 --> 35:38.650
That's another touchdown
for the Titans.

35:38.850 --> 35:40.620
Oh, God!

turning on their own mascot.

35:49.430 --> 35:50.530
[crowd booing]

35:50.730 --> 35:52.100
No wonder these kids
can't win a game.

35:52.300 --> 35:53.500
They need to be put in line.

35:53.700 --> 35:54.800
Did they just throw a hot dog?

35:55.000 --> 35:57.470
- This is why my identity has
to remain a secret, isn't it?

35:57.670 --> 35:58.770
Don't run on a straight line.

35:58.970 --> 36:00.690
It just makes it easier
for them to hit you.

36:06.360 --> 36:07.680
- So is it
hot off the presses yet?

36:07.880 --> 36:09.380
No, it's in the trash.

36:09.580 --> 36:10.580
What are you talking about?

36:10.780 --> 36:12.120
- You forged
Mr. Daniels' signature.

36:12.320 --> 36:13.320
When he found out,

36:13.520 --> 36:14.800
he said he had to throw out
all the papers we printed.

36:15.970 --> 36:16.670
- Everybody's hard work down
the drain because of you.

36:17.100 --> 36:18.640
Thanks a lot.

36:25.460 --> 36:27.230
- Why did you can the
entire article this week?

36:27.430 --> 36:28.400
I thought once
you read my paper,

36:28.600 --> 36:29.530
that you would be on my side.

36:29.730 --> 36:30.870
- Because, as your teacher--

36:31.070 --> 36:32.840
Stop saying that.

36:33.040 --> 36:33.900
[clears throat]

36:34.100 --> 36:36.770

and we both know it.

36:40.410 --> 36:43.310
Fine.
You're right.

36:43.510 --> 36:47.320
We were more than that.

36:47.520 --> 36:50.550
But it can't happen again.

36:50.750 --> 36:51.460
Why not?

36:51.660 --> 36:54.590
- Those restrooms were a hike.

Olivia, this is Barbara.

My fiancée.
[Barbara giggles]

37:04.940 --> 37:05.900
Pleased to meet you.

37:06.100 --> 37:07.440
Likewise.

37:07.640 --> 37:08.440
I just love meeting
Leonard's students.

37:08.640 --> 37:10.210

- Oh.

37:10.410 --> 37:11.840
Give me the skinny, Olivia.

37:12.040 --> 37:13.840
Is he the most handsome teacher
at Rydell or what?

37:24.920 --> 37:26.560

to be a Rangers fan

37:26.760 --> 37:30.530
and they forfeit another play
to a Titan touchdown.

37:30.730 --> 37:32.660
Now they are 20 up.

37:32.860 --> 37:36.770
Even with benching number 18,
Rydell cannot catch a break.

37:36.970 --> 37:37.770
You know, Rowdy,

37:37.970 --> 37:39.400
Buddy's my pal,
but I gotta say

37:39.600 --> 37:41.270
he comes out here
and stinks every week,

37:41.470 --> 37:42.870
and they never bench him.

37:43.070 --> 37:44.540
I'm starting to feel like
I'm only good for one thing

37:44.740 --> 37:47.710
at this school, and I just--
I just flat-wheeled it.

37:52.580 --> 37:53.720
Ah, forget it.

37:53.920 --> 37:55.920
I'm just feel sorry for myself.

37:56.120 --> 37:58.320
I know this is all in my head.

37:58.520 --> 38:00.460
Oh, this is not in your head.

38:00.660 --> 38:02.590
Everyone here
blames us for this.

Nancy?

38:03.660 --> 38:05.000
No names.

38:05.200 --> 38:06.730
[whistle blows]

38:06.930 --> 38:09.730
- What a towering kick
made by the Titans.

38:09.930 --> 38:12.400
The Titans are
dominating this field.

38:12.600 --> 38:13.800
This is probably hard on you

38:14.000 --> 38:16.470
because you're popular
for some reason,

38:16.670 --> 38:19.410
but you get used to it.

38:19.610 --> 38:21.950
When I was little,
kids used to throw rocks at me

38:22.150 --> 38:24.380
and call me a dirty Jap.

38:24.580 --> 38:25.750
They blamed me for the war.

38:25.950 --> 38:28.390
- World War II?
- World War II.

38:28.590 --> 38:30.520
I was still saying "pa-sketti."

38:30.720 --> 38:32.590
- I said "lellow" instead
of yellow for a long time.

38:32.790 --> 38:34.260
- When people want
to blame someone,

38:34.460 --> 38:36.290
it's easier to blame
the person who's different,

38:36.490 --> 38:38.430
but just because
a bunch of people

38:38.630 --> 38:40.300
are loudly saying
the same thing

38:40.500 --> 38:43.270
doesn't mean
you have to listen.

Once you realize
you'll never win with them,

well do whatever you want.

Wally?

first touchdown,

39:58.270 --> 40:00.080
- That's six points
for the Rangers.

40:00.280 --> 40:02.810
Putting Number 18 back in play
paid off for Rydell.

Of course not.

Bye.

Are you okay?

40:24.030 --> 40:25.520
that this place
could ever change.

Rydell is always going to be
miserable, especially for me.

40:28.870 --> 40:31.780
Did something happen?

40:31.980 --> 40:34.510
- Mr. Daniels threw out
my article.

40:34.710 --> 40:36.450
I know it's just
a dumb school paper,

40:36.650 --> 40:37.880
but I really thought
that what I wrote

40:38.080 --> 40:39.420
was going to make a difference.

40:39.620 --> 40:40.950
It made a difference to me.

40:41.150 --> 40:43.850
That first article made me
feel like I wasn't alone.

40:44.050 --> 40:46.060
And that's what our campaign
is all about.

losing a little less.

you say it in the paper,

we'll just have to
find another way

40:59.800 --> 41:00.940

when we work together?

41:25.900 --> 41:28.100
We can win.
But that's not what they want.

41:28.300 --> 41:29.870
They want to pit us
against each other

41:30.070 --> 41:32.870
so they can control us,
tell us what to wear,

41:33.070 --> 41:35.740
what plays to do,
what music to play.

41:38.910 --> 41:42.110
[brassy dramatic music]

41:42.310 --> 41:46.650
- * You think I'm the enemy,
boxing up identity *

41:46.850 --> 41:48.990
* But that's all
they want us to see *

41:49.190 --> 41:53.460
* Divide us into pedigrees,
we fight over everything *

41:53.660 --> 41:55.760
* Instead of going
'gainst the machine *

41:55.960 --> 41:59.030
* We keep on pointing fingers

41:59.230 --> 42:02.570
* Ready to pull the trigger

42:02.770 --> 42:05.200
* Be careful what you say

42:05.400 --> 42:09.240
* It's a shame on our names
when we play the blame game *

42:09.440 --> 42:13.010
all: * Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh,
hey! *

42:13.210 --> 42:16.650
* Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh,
hey! *

42:16.850 --> 42:19.250
* Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

42:19.450 --> 42:20.620
- * Hey!
- Hey.

42:20.820 --> 42:24.020
all:
* Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

42:24.220 --> 42:26.260
both: * They want us
to take the fall *

42:26.460 --> 42:27.920
* Pinning us against the wall

42:28.120 --> 42:30.730
* Framing like
it's all of our fault *

42:30.930 --> 42:33.130
* So they can
ride into the sunset *

42:33.330 --> 42:34.800
* Taking all our powers

42:35.000 --> 42:40.200
* Abusing, accusing teenagers
like cowards! *

42:40.400 --> 42:43.840
all:
* We keep on pointing fingers

42:44.040 --> 42:47.540
* Ready to pull the trigger

42:47.740 --> 42:49.750
* Be careful what you say

42:49.950 --> 42:50.980
Oh, come on.

42:51.180 --> 42:52.650
all:
* It's a shame on our names

42:52.850 --> 42:54.690
* When we play the blame game

42:54.890 --> 42:57.920
* Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh,
hey! *

42:58.120 --> 43:00.120
* Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

43:00.320 --> 43:02.160
- * No more pointing fingers
all: * Hey!

43:02.360 --> 43:04.860
* Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh,
hey! *

43:05.060 --> 43:08.600
* Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh,
hey! *

43:08.800 --> 43:12.170
* No, we don't have to take it
if we come together *

43:12.370 --> 43:15.540
T-Birds: * We don't have to
take it if we come together *

43:15.740 --> 43:16.940
Pink Ladies: * No,
we don't have to take it *

43:17.140 --> 43:18.880
* If we come together

43:19.080 --> 43:22.110
* If we play the blame game,
it's a surrender! *

43:22.310 --> 43:24.050
all: * Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh,
hey! *

43:24.250 --> 43:26.180
- * Oh,
no more pointing fingers *

43:26.380 --> 43:28.650
- * We don't have to take it
if we come together *

43:28.850 --> 43:31.190
* Hey, oh,
oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh *

43:31.390 --> 43:32.920
- Sorry, teach!
- [gasps] No, no, no!

43:33.120 --> 43:35.260
- No!
- Go! Come on!

43:35.460 --> 43:36.660
all: * Hey!

43:36.860 --> 43:39.030
* Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh,
hey! *

43:39.230 --> 43:40.710
Rosemary, what are you doing?

43:41.980 --> 43:42.700
- I want to be able to wear my
boyfriend's jacket at school.

43:42.900 --> 43:44.030
Sue me.

43:44.230 --> 43:46.070
all: * Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh,
hey! *

43:46.270 --> 43:49.140
- * Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
- * No more pointing fingers

43:49.340 --> 43:51.570
all: * Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh,
hey! *

43:51.780 --> 43:56.150
* No more pointing fingers!

43:56.350 --> 43:58.820
all: * Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh,
hey! *

43:59.020 --> 43:59.920
* No more pointing fingers!

44:00.120 --> 44:01.580
I'm getting all your names.

44:01.790 --> 44:05.620
* No more pointing fingers!

44:05.820 --> 44:09.110
* Whoa, oh-oh!

44:11.410 --> 44:12.910
[both gasp]

44:14.350 --> 44:16.870
[cheers and applause]

44:17.070 --> 44:21.810
- Wally! Wally!
Wally! Wally! Wally!

44:22.010 --> 44:23.910
- Why are you cheering?
We didn't win.

44:24.110 --> 44:25.280
We only lost by two points.

44:25.480 --> 44:27.140
- Yeah, that's the
best we've ever done.

44:27.340 --> 44:28.230
[cheering]

44:29.060 --> 44:29.900
- [giggles]
I knew you could do it.

44:30.430 --> 44:32.050
I'm pretty hungry.

44:32.250 --> 44:34.820
[rock music playing
on jukebox]

44:35.020 --> 44:37.090
- It's okay. It's fine.
- [chuckles]

44:37.290 --> 44:40.960
- Hello? I'm trying
to get some service over here!

44:41.160 --> 44:42.060
- I just wanted
to let you know

44:42.260 --> 44:44.290
I'm going to do the play too.

44:44.490 --> 44:45.800
But you didn't audition.

44:46.000 --> 44:47.930
- I was thinking
I could do props.

44:48.130 --> 44:49.330
We could still
walk home together.

44:49.530 --> 44:51.070
I...

44:51.270 --> 44:54.170
don't think I'm going to do it.

44:54.370 --> 44:55.270
Who am I kidding?

44:55.470 --> 44:57.240
[laughing]
I can't do Shakespeare.

44:57.440 --> 44:58.710
I am not a thespian.

44:58.910 --> 45:00.310
Oh, yeah!

45:00.510 --> 45:02.010
Of course, after tonight,

45:02.210 --> 45:04.920
I'm not sure I'm much
of a football player either.

45:05.120 --> 45:09.350
- Buddy?
Do you want to order?

45:09.550 --> 45:11.890
I can help you run lines.

45:12.090 --> 45:14.390
I'm not a thespian either.

45:14.590 --> 45:16.730
I'm a shy science nerd, but--

45:16.930 --> 45:19.760
[indistinct chatter]

45:19.960 --> 45:20.960
I don't know.

45:21.160 --> 45:22.830
What if we could
be more than one thing?

45:23.030 --> 45:25.970
*

45:26.170 --> 45:28.270
Buddy?

45:28.470 --> 45:31.780
*

45:31.980 --> 45:33.210
[chuckles softly]

45:33.410 --> 45:34.750
Yeah, you know what?

45:34.950 --> 45:36.850
Let's do it.

45:37.050 --> 45:37.850
[chuckles softly]

45:38.050 --> 45:40.820
[chatter and laughter]

45:41.020 --> 45:43.450
*

45:43.650 --> 45:45.190
* A lion is a lion

45:45.390 --> 45:47.890
- Riveting!
I mean, did you see yourself?

45:48.090 --> 45:50.290
And the band?
[indistinct chatter]

45:50.490 --> 45:53.160
Jane.

45:53.360 --> 45:58.030
*

45:58.230 --> 46:00.470
both: I'm sorry.
It was--

46:00.670 --> 46:03.810
[laughter]

46:04.010 --> 46:05.240
What?

46:05.440 --> 46:06.710
- [T-Birds stop laughing]
- [sucks straw]

46:06.910 --> 46:09.010
*

46:09.210 --> 46:12.820
- Look, I like that
you're a dog with a bone.

46:13.020 --> 46:14.990
I could use
a little bit of that.

46:15.190 --> 46:18.320
But we're--[sighs]
I don't know.

46:18.520 --> 46:21.220
Different?

46:21.420 --> 46:22.930
- Maybe that's
what makes it fun.

46:23.130 --> 46:23.830
- [stifled laughter]
- [imitates gagging]

46:24.030 --> 46:25.100
You know...

46:25.300 --> 46:28.160
I could use a little of what
you've got too.

46:28.360 --> 46:29.800
- Want to cut fourth period
tomorrow,

46:30.000 --> 46:31.300
and we split our differences?

46:31.500 --> 46:33.840
*

46:34.040 --> 46:35.910
No.

46:36.110 --> 46:36.970
I'm sorry.

46:37.170 --> 46:39.240
I--I hate missing class.

46:39.440 --> 46:42.050
- It's cool, it's cool.
- [chuckles]

46:42.250 --> 46:44.780
But I will be hall monitoring
tomorrow,

46:44.980 --> 46:46.420
and if you happen
to see a hall pass

46:46.620 --> 46:48.920
that fell out of my jacket,

46:49.120 --> 46:51.420
you could come return it
to me...

46:51.620 --> 46:56.230
in the broom closet
during second period.

46:56.430 --> 46:57.260
Ow!

46:57.460 --> 46:58.760
Oh.

46:58.960 --> 47:02.270
- * Trying to make
a monkey out of me *

47:02.470 --> 47:04.170
*

47:04.370 --> 47:06.900
* Ooh, I'm so disgusted

47:07.100 --> 47:08.440
[indistinct chatter]

47:08.640 --> 47:10.510
[cheers and laughter]

47:10.710 --> 47:13.210
- Where's our hall passes?
- Yeah, what the heck?

47:13.410 --> 47:16.080
- I ran out.
I don't have another one.

47:16.280 --> 47:18.780
- * Oh, hello little boy,
don't you remember me? *

47:18.980 --> 47:21.550
[cheers and applause]

47:21.750 --> 47:24.320
*

47:24.520 --> 47:26.090
- Thanks for getting
our jackets back!

47:26.290 --> 47:28.220
- Everybody vote
for the Pink Ladies!

47:28.420 --> 47:31.060
- Vote Pink! Vote Pink!
Vote Pink!

47:31.260 --> 47:33.900
[whistling and applause]

47:34.100 --> 47:36.570
This is all your fault.

47:36.770 --> 47:38.430
You know something?

47:38.630 --> 47:40.570
I'm starting to like school.

47:40.770 --> 47:42.510
- * Well,
but when you love me *

47:42.710 --> 47:44.310
* Can't help but scream,
hey! *

47:44.510 --> 47:45.960
*
