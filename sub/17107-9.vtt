00:02.839 --> 00:05.799
TARA NARRATING: Previously
on "Dance Academy."

00:05.839 --> 00:07.320
-You're flirting with him.

00:07.360 --> 00:09.599
-He wants me as a muse.

00:09.640 --> 00:10.599
-Will I have a solo or not?

00:10.640 --> 00:12.039
-Well, it's a pretty
big decision.

00:12.080 --> 00:14.320
Sir Jeffrey's considering me for
a choreography residence,

00:14.359 --> 00:15.320
so it's kind of my audition.

00:15.359 --> 00:17.320
-You want a job with
the company.

00:17.359 --> 00:18.399
-You read my journal?

00:18.440 --> 00:20.199
-Oh, pages and pages
about you and him.

00:20.239 --> 00:22.079
-You have no reason
not to trust me.

00:27.199 --> 00:30.519
-I kept thinking, when is
this going to stop?

00:30.559 --> 00:32.799
Because I want so much
to be rid of you.

00:32.840 --> 00:36.359
It's all I could think about
during that ceremony.

00:36.399 --> 00:38.640
-Did it work?

00:38.679 --> 00:40.479
[theme music]

01:28.519 --> 01:31.200
-You've still got a little--

01:31.239 --> 01:32.480
you have a little--

01:32.519 --> 01:33.680
here.

01:38.640 --> 01:41.120
TARA NARRATING: "Cheating"
as defined by "Webster's

01:41.159 --> 01:42.640
Dictionary"--

01:42.680 --> 01:46.159
"to hoodwink or swindle, to
engage in deceitful behavior,

01:46.200 --> 01:47.519
practice trickery or fraud."

01:47.560 --> 01:49.640
-The original training bra.

01:49.680 --> 01:50.799
Me again.

01:54.760 --> 01:55.480
TARA NARRATING: What
about "cheating"

01:55.519 --> 01:57.760
according to this Webster?

01:57.799 --> 02:01.400
I always thought kissing was the
boundary line, but is it

02:01.439 --> 02:02.760
murkier than that?

02:02.799 --> 02:06.159
Can you cheat in a look,
a thought, a moment of

02:06.200 --> 02:07.239
connection?

02:07.280 --> 02:09.199
-The good days, I'll
just keep moving.

02:09.240 --> 02:12.520
And if I stop, it just
slams me that--

02:12.560 --> 02:14.360
that Sammy's not here.

02:23.680 --> 02:25.639
TARA NARRATING: Whatever
the definition, one

02:25.680 --> 02:27.319
thing's pretty clear.

02:27.360 --> 02:28.479
-Christian?

02:28.520 --> 02:29.840
-Yeah?

02:29.879 --> 02:32.800
-I love you too.

02:32.840 --> 02:34.479
TARA NARRATING: If it feels
like you're cheating, you

02:34.520 --> 02:35.680
probably are.

02:51.319 --> 02:51.639
JAMIE (OFFSCREEN): Wheels up.

02:51.680 --> 02:53.120
Come on.

02:53.159 --> 02:54.319
DIRECTOR (ON WALKIE-TALKIE):
Jamie, we need Kat on set now.

02:54.360 --> 02:55.520
-We're traveling.

02:55.560 --> 02:57.319
-I'll cherish it forever,
Gerald!

02:57.360 --> 03:00.199
Now there's just one gaping
hole in the crew list.

03:00.240 --> 03:02.360
-For the millionth time,
this cat don't dance.

03:02.400 --> 03:03.639
Not in public.

03:03.680 --> 03:04.800
-Oh, come on.

03:04.840 --> 03:07.199
The blooper reel is this
Kat's present to the

03:07.240 --> 03:09.199
wrap party in absentia.

03:09.240 --> 03:10.120
-What?

03:10.159 --> 03:11.199
-Uh, it's nothing.

03:11.240 --> 03:12.120
Uh, do you have my--

03:12.159 --> 03:14.120
-Script, mints.

03:14.159 --> 03:15.560
-Thank you.

03:15.599 --> 03:17.800
-I mean, when the lead cast miss
the wrap party, they tend

03:17.840 --> 03:18.800
to look a little bit snotty.

03:18.840 --> 03:20.680
I don't want you risk that.

03:20.719 --> 03:22.639
-Well, her friends are coming
back from tour and they've got

03:22.680 --> 03:25.159
really important performance.

03:25.199 --> 03:28.680
-And which particular friend
told you that, sweetie?

03:28.719 --> 03:31.560
Eh?

03:31.599 --> 03:33.400
ABIGAIL (OFFSCREEN):
Just let me do it.

03:33.439 --> 03:34.800
WES (OFFSCREEN): No.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.439
-There's no point acting all
boyfriendy and putting an

03:36.479 --> 03:39.199
official label on this until Sir
Jeffrey decides to employ

03:39.240 --> 03:40.360
you or not.

03:40.400 --> 03:43.159
-I'm sorry, are you doubting
the wunderkind?

03:43.199 --> 03:44.800
-If you're not staying in
Sydney, I don't want you

03:44.840 --> 03:46.080
getting too attached.

03:46.120 --> 03:48.400
You already flew out here
from Barcelona for this.

03:48.439 --> 03:49.159
-No worries.

03:49.199 --> 03:50.439
Sir Jeffrey will love me.

03:50.479 --> 03:52.240
He'll love my work.

03:52.280 --> 03:53.360
-Even if I'm dancing it?

03:53.400 --> 03:55.400
-Especially if you're
dancing it?

03:58.319 --> 04:01.639
[cheering]

04:01.680 --> 04:02.280
-Tara!

04:02.319 --> 04:02.960
Tara, wait up.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.599
I saved you breakfast.

04:04.639 --> 04:06.479
I know it doesn't make up for
reading your journal.

04:06.520 --> 04:08.199
It's pretty soggy now.

04:08.240 --> 04:10.039
-You didn't have to make
up for anything.

04:10.080 --> 04:11.400
-Well, you didn't answer
any of my calls

04:11.439 --> 04:14.400
last night, so clearly--

04:14.439 --> 04:17.079
I'm going to use this entire
trip home to conjure up a

04:17.120 --> 04:18.600
proper apology.

04:18.639 --> 04:21.120
-I think you had a point about
the love thing, how I couldn't

04:21.160 --> 04:21.800
say it back.

04:21.839 --> 04:22.680
-No, it's just timing.

04:22.720 --> 04:24.160
-Maybe.

04:24.199 --> 04:27.319
But I did feel that way about
Christian, so it might be a

04:27.360 --> 04:30.600
sign for us not to
be us anymore.

04:30.639 --> 04:32.759
I mean, we work so
well as friends.

04:36.639 --> 04:37.480
-Ben, I'm, uh, sorry.

04:37.519 --> 04:38.759
I made the call.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.560
Christian's going to play
Romeo in the festival.

04:40.600 --> 04:42.600
It came down to the final act.

04:42.639 --> 04:45.759
He just takes it to
that darker place.

04:45.800 --> 04:46.600
-Yeah, cool.

04:46.639 --> 04:47.800
No worries.

04:51.839 --> 04:57.319
Let's brainstorm solutions
on the bus.

04:57.360 --> 05:00.040
-I don't know how to do this.

05:00.079 --> 05:03.160
I always thought you'd
be the one to go.

05:03.199 --> 05:04.360
-Hey.

05:07.879 --> 05:10.040
Don't lose it.

05:10.079 --> 05:13.079
I know it won't be the same,
but we'll always have--

05:13.120 --> 05:14.439
-Gladstone.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.279
We'll always have Gladstone.

05:20.680 --> 05:22.040
-Cut.

05:22.079 --> 05:23.319
Print.

05:23.360 --> 05:24.600
Fantastic.

05:24.639 --> 05:29.160
-Everybody, that is a wrap
on Katrina Karamakov!

05:29.199 --> 05:30.120
-Congratulations, sweetheart.

05:30.160 --> 05:32.600
You have your life back.

05:32.639 --> 05:34.759
Rhys, can I talk you through
some blocking?

05:37.639 --> 05:41.319
-Um, I thought my last scene
wasn't until tomorrow.

05:41.360 --> 05:42.600
-They just dropped it.

05:42.639 --> 05:44.120
You're done.

05:44.160 --> 05:45.560
-Oh.

05:45.600 --> 05:49.399
-So the other function wrap
parties perform is for crew

05:49.439 --> 05:52.800
members to act on their
unresolved tensions.

05:52.839 --> 05:56.600
-Katrina, can I look forward
to having you back in class

05:56.639 --> 05:58.560
any time in the foreseeable
future?

05:58.600 --> 06:01.399
-Um, tomorrow, as it happens.

06:01.439 --> 06:03.199
Can't wait.

06:03.240 --> 06:04.839
-I've been meaning to ask.

06:04.879 --> 06:08.680
Who is that woman?

06:08.720 --> 06:10.040
Right.

06:14.560 --> 06:16.480
-I think it's like ice cream.

06:16.519 --> 06:18.360
I used to love it ob--

06:18.399 --> 06:19.720
obsessively.

06:19.759 --> 06:23.319
But then during chemo, I
couldn't stomach dairy, so Mum

06:23.360 --> 06:25.120
made me switch to gelati.

06:25.160 --> 06:27.680
And at first, I was
like, ugh, robbed.

06:27.720 --> 06:29.600
But now, gelati all the way.

06:29.639 --> 06:31.480
-I don't think it's
the same thing.

06:31.519 --> 06:32.480
-No, no.

06:32.519 --> 06:33.319
I'm gelati.

06:33.360 --> 06:34.279
Christian's ice cream.

06:34.319 --> 06:34.879
-No, I--

06:34.920 --> 06:36.240
I get the analogy.

06:36.279 --> 06:40.639
It's just what if I never get
to that same level with

06:40.680 --> 06:44.160
gelati, and I should?

06:44.199 --> 06:46.120
-It's just the tour.

06:46.160 --> 06:47.519
It's been full on.

06:47.560 --> 06:49.600
And you can't break up with
someone without a warning.

06:49.639 --> 06:53.040
So now we're on our way
home, we'll fix it.

06:57.360 --> 06:58.759
-OK, guys.

06:58.800 --> 07:00.800
I'm coming through with your
schedules and running order

07:00.839 --> 07:02.319
for tomorrow.

07:02.360 --> 07:05.199
I don't need to reiterate this
festival is Sir Jeffrey's pet

07:05.240 --> 07:07.639
project, which makes it
the most important

07:07.680 --> 07:09.279
performance of the tour.

07:09.319 --> 07:12.560
Do me proud.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.160
-Ben!

07:14.199 --> 07:18.519
Oh, what did I miss?

07:18.560 --> 07:20.519
[MUSIC - BUDSPELLS,
"FORGOTTEN SOULS"]

07:27.680 --> 07:30.079
-You're still favoring
your right foot.

07:30.120 --> 07:32.120
-Yeah, it's just a
dodgy toenail.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.639
-Well, make sure you swing
by Dr. Wicks, all right?

07:33.680 --> 07:36.560
You're my guy tomorrow.

07:36.600 --> 07:38.439
-Ugh.

07:38.480 --> 07:39.279
Give us a squeeze.

07:39.319 --> 07:39.800
-No.

07:39.839 --> 07:40.360
-Come on.

07:40.399 --> 07:41.240
-No, no.

07:41.279 --> 07:42.839
-Hey, I played a
paramedic once.

07:42.879 --> 07:45.360
I do a beautiful pressure
bandage.

07:45.399 --> 07:46.480
-Aww.

07:46.519 --> 07:47.680
Dancers, we're--

07:47.720 --> 07:48.480
we're tough.

07:48.519 --> 07:49.759
-Yeah, I know.

07:49.800 --> 07:52.040
You can fight off zombies
in a single developpe.

07:52.079 --> 07:54.120
I saw the clip.

07:54.160 --> 07:57.360
-Wait, did Rhys O'Leary just
admit to cyberstalking me?

07:57.399 --> 07:59.160
-Well, the song, it's
not that catchy.

07:59.199 --> 08:01.160
-Yeah, the head count
was about eight.

08:01.199 --> 08:02.279
Then Mum had the relos over.

08:02.319 --> 08:04.199
That bumped it up to
double digits.

08:04.240 --> 08:05.319
-You know what?

08:05.360 --> 08:06.759
I can help you out.

08:06.800 --> 08:10.480
I am a Luddite with social
media, but my publicist set up

08:10.519 --> 08:13.439
this tweeting thing, I think.

08:13.480 --> 08:14.720
-You think?

08:14.759 --> 08:17.839
You have over a million
followers.

08:17.879 --> 08:19.199
-Sorry, who's been
cyberstalking?

08:40.360 --> 08:42.120
-He didn't want to hear it.

08:42.159 --> 08:44.840
I think it's better if I wait
until after the festival.

08:44.879 --> 08:45.840
-Hang on.

08:45.879 --> 08:49.080
He-- he didn't want
to hear what?

08:49.120 --> 08:53.840
-That sounds like a pretty
clear breakup attempt.

08:53.879 --> 08:55.639
$5 says something happened.

08:55.679 --> 08:57.159
-No.

08:57.200 --> 09:01.600

and I believe her.

09:01.639 --> 09:05.200
-I can't believe you'd do that
after he just lost Romeo.

-But--

-Yeah, yeah.

the floor.

-Hi.

09:48.679 --> 09:49.759
-She's overreacted.

09:49.799 --> 09:50.759
-It's infected.

09:50.799 --> 09:51.679
Dr. Wicks says you're
not dancing.

09:51.720 --> 09:53.240
-Zach, it's a toenail.

09:53.279 --> 09:56.240
-Oliver, first rule of
professional conduct--

09:56.279 --> 09:58.399
take care of injuries
before they

09:58.440 --> 10:00.799
become everyone's problem.

10:00.840 --> 10:03.759

10:03.799 --> 10:05.840
-Uh, I do mostly.

10:05.879 --> 10:07.320
-Christian, you're
playing Romeo.

10:07.360 --> 10:08.399
-Yeah, but Ben could do that.

-Oh good, Benjamin and Tara.

ruined my gala.

-So?

10:12.960 --> 10:15.639
Sir Jeffrey was talking about
my legs, wasn't he.

10:15.679 --> 10:19.120
If you need to recast, this
thing shouldn't affect dance

10:19.159 --> 10:19.720
decisions.

10:19.759 --> 10:20.879
-OK, this "thing"?

10:20.919 --> 10:22.279
You need to keep workshopping
that label.

10:22.320 --> 10:23.840
But, um, listen, I
just gotta, um--

10:23.879 --> 10:25.799
-No, we need to keep
rehearsing.

10:25.840 --> 10:28.159
It's fairly essentially we
both impress tonight.

10:28.200 --> 10:29.639
-No, you know, you're
doing great, OK?

10:29.679 --> 10:31.240
I'll meet you at the theater.

10:37.240 --> 10:39.360
-Admit it, you're pining
for us already.

10:39.399 --> 10:40.480
-OK.

10:40.519 --> 10:44.799
Yes, fine, I will come
to the wrap party.

Like, no matter what I do, the
universe just slaps me every

10:50.559 --> 10:51.080
time.

10:51.120 --> 10:52.200
-Hey.

would shut down and that's why
