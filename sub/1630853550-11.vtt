<i>Previously on</i>
Roswell, New Mexico...

00:03.046 --> 00:04.743
<i>Jones said, once you've gathered</i>

00:04.787 --> 00:07.572
<i>all the pieces, Liz Ortecho</i> <i>will bring the alighting.</i>

00:07.616 --> 00:09.661
This is a method
of transportation?

00:09.705 --> 00:11.707
I'm thinking about a lot
that would prevent him

00:11.750 --> 00:13.622
and his followers
from ever using it.

00:13.665 --> 00:15.363
<i>That's what Jones</i> <i>wanted from Liz.</i>

00:15.406 --> 00:17.800
He thought that she could
pick that lock.

00:17.843 --> 00:19.062
Clyde, he's a true believer.

00:19.106 --> 00:20.455
He didn't need
his precious savior

00:20.498 --> 00:22.587
to warp his mind into obeying.

00:22.631 --> 00:24.067
All right, look, whatever

00:24.111 --> 00:25.416
your problem is
with me and my father,

00:25.460 --> 00:27.244
<i>it's got nothing to do with her.</i>

00:27.288 --> 00:28.767
She'll pay for what she did
against the cause.

00:28.811 --> 00:30.117
This isn't over.

00:30.160 --> 00:31.814
Given I now have
the means to finish

00:31.857 --> 00:34.077
what my savior asked
to be built, I think it is.

00:49.701 --> 00:51.138
I sense your nerves.

00:52.791 --> 00:54.576
You needn't be afraid.

00:56.099 --> 00:58.449
I see great potential in you.

00:58.493 --> 01:01.931
Tonight, you become
a child of Ophiuchus.

01:03.672 --> 01:07.284
Like this precious flower

01:07.328 --> 01:10.113
that grows from the ashes
of our people.

01:10.157 --> 01:12.463
Some believe that

01:12.507 --> 01:15.118
it is our spirit
blossoming anew.

01:15.162 --> 01:16.902
Like this flower,

01:16.946 --> 01:19.166
we will rise
from the ashes of Oasis

01:19.209 --> 01:21.211
and ascend

01:21.255 --> 01:23.344
to a greater purpose.

01:27.913 --> 01:30.351
I want nothing more.

01:30.394 --> 01:33.310
My life was meaningless
before your teachings.

01:33.354 --> 01:35.704
Well, there is more to Ophiuchus
than being a follower.

01:43.886 --> 01:45.235
Uh, what is that, my savior?

01:45.279 --> 01:46.671
A chance to evolve.

01:46.715 --> 01:49.587
No doubt you've heard
the stories

01:49.631 --> 01:53.983
of how I used science
to enhance my abilities.

01:55.245 --> 01:56.986
As one of
my most loyal acolytes,

01:57.029 --> 01:59.684
I would like you to join
my inner circle

01:59.728 --> 02:01.382
and share this gift

02:01.425 --> 02:02.818
with you.

02:04.385 --> 02:05.777
Why me?

02:05.821 --> 02:08.519
I never even formed
my own Triad.

02:08.563 --> 02:11.827
I can offer you something
so much better than a Triad.

02:11.870 --> 02:16.092
This Ophiuchan mark
forges a bond between us

02:16.136 --> 02:19.226
that allows you to draw
on my strength.

02:19.269 --> 02:22.272
That is the sacrifice
I will make for you.

02:22.316 --> 02:24.144
And there will
come a time

02:24.187 --> 02:26.885
when I will require a sacrifice
from you in return.

02:39.811 --> 02:41.683
Welcome to my family.

♪ You...

02:53.173 --> 02:55.000
Yo, teach.

02:56.611 --> 02:57.916
Mind if I clear this booth
before the morning rush?

02:57.960 --> 02:59.396
Vanessa,

03:09.058 --> 03:11.321

the soup of the day.

03:19.547 --> 03:21.810
Never mind.
Uh, what do you need, Rosa?

03:21.853 --> 03:24.987
My brain used to get foggy, too,
when I was coming down.

03:25.030 --> 03:26.206
I don't have time for this.

03:26.249 --> 03:27.903
Well, make time, Liz.

03:27.946 --> 03:29.818
I mean, the alien mist
is taking over your life.

03:29.861 --> 03:32.212
You moved out of Max's house,
you took my blood

03:32.255 --> 03:34.475
to save Michigan J Frog.
I mean, when was the last time

03:34.518 --> 03:36.259
that you slept or thought about
anything other than science?

03:36.303 --> 03:38.957
How about you focus

What is this?

03:50.186 --> 03:52.580
Some sort of intervention?
She's being melodramatic.

03:52.623 --> 03:54.277
She's not the only one

Look, I'm sure
I'm the last person

but we all want to help.

03:57.672 --> 03:59.064
Must not be that bad, right?
Otherwise,

03:59.108 --> 04:00.849
- Maria would be here.
- She wanted to be.

04:00.892 --> 04:02.285
She's keeping watch
at Alien-henge

04:02.329 --> 04:03.678
in case someone tries
to phone home.

04:03.721 --> 04:05.375
Guerin and Alex
would've been here, too,

04:05.419 --> 04:07.638
if they weren't stuck inside
Theo's pocket dimension.

04:07.682 --> 04:10.075
Which is why I am working
to pull them out.

04:10.119 --> 04:11.599
God, I just need to take

04:11.642 --> 04:13.209
a little bit longer,
and then I'll be fine...

04:13.253 --> 04:14.428
Yeah, a little bit
turns into a lot, Liz.

04:14.471 --> 04:15.907
You keep feeding the fix

04:15.951 --> 04:17.300
until there's nothing
left to feed.

04:17.344 --> 04:18.823
Come with us to Deep Sky.

04:18.867 --> 04:20.434
We'll set you up to detox.

04:20.477 --> 04:21.870
I'm working
on a hybrid methadone

04:21.913 --> 04:23.001
that'll help ease
the withdrawal symptoms.

04:23.045 --> 04:24.612
No, no, just because you've done

04:24.655 --> 04:25.917
a couple backdoor
alien surgeries does not mean

04:25.961 --> 04:27.179
you understand
what I'm doing, Kyle.

04:27.223 --> 04:28.790
I just watched

04:28.833 --> 04:31.749
the most irredeemable person
you can imagine

04:31.793 --> 04:33.751
find her second act.

04:33.795 --> 04:35.884
If Tezca can rehabilitate
herself, Liz, so can you.

04:35.927 --> 04:37.494
I am working on this

04:37.538 --> 04:39.453
to protect us from threats
she set in motion.

04:39.496 --> 04:41.019
And Clyde,

04:41.063 --> 04:43.021
well, he's still out there
doing God knows what.

04:43.065 --> 04:44.806
What are these
equations, Liz?

04:44.849 --> 04:47.417
Clyde is interested
in harnessing your abilities.

04:47.461 --> 04:49.289
And since you gave them up,
I am charting

04:49.332 --> 04:51.334
the nucleotides
in your triple helix to see

04:51.378 --> 04:54.163
if I can fight fire
with actual fire.

04:54.206 --> 04:56.861
Oh, by replicating
the blue flame in the lab.

04:56.905 --> 04:58.385
Yes.

04:58.428 --> 05:00.038
You're only going down

05:00.082 --> 05:02.302
this spiral because I refused
to face my fears.

05:03.868 --> 05:06.306
But this is so much worse.

05:06.349 --> 05:08.656
I can't lose you, Liz.

05:08.699 --> 05:12.660
So, if saving you
means getting my abilities back,

05:12.703 --> 05:14.009
that's what I'm gonna do.

05:17.273 --> 05:18.709
It's too late.

05:20.015 --> 05:21.930
I used all the mist.

05:21.973 --> 05:24.019
So we'll go to Senovative.

05:24.062 --> 05:26.151
There's nothing
we can't overcome together.

05:27.457 --> 05:29.807
You were my turquoise.
Now let me be yours.

05:31.853 --> 05:33.768
Hey.

05:33.811 --> 05:36.988
Use that supercharged brain
and think of all the scenarios.

05:37.032 --> 05:39.861
You know what happens if
you keep going down this path.

05:45.954 --> 05:48.217
I can't walk away.

05:48.260 --> 05:49.653
Then walk towards us.

05:51.089 --> 05:53.614
Liz, let's go right now, okay?
Let's go pack a bag.

06:11.458 --> 06:13.764
DALLAS:Bonnie and I have already
searched half the town

06:13.808 --> 06:15.287
following my dad's clues.

06:15.331 --> 06:17.072
Where could Alex be hiding?

06:18.378 --> 06:21.468
All I know is, is once I get
this rust bucket purring again,

06:21.511 --> 06:24.166
we're kicking the search party
into high gear.

06:27.691 --> 06:30.128
Maybe we should look for
some alien trees.

06:30.172 --> 06:31.652
You know,
we're gonna need the fruit

06:31.695 --> 06:33.001
to open
the portal home.

06:33.044 --> 06:34.785
And which home would that be?

06:34.829 --> 06:36.439
You thinking about
making the jump to Oasis?

06:36.483 --> 06:39.311
Well, we're not jumping anywhere
without the fruit.

06:40.312 --> 06:42.227
You can go apple picking
all you want,

06:42.271 --> 06:44.099
but my priority

06:44.142 --> 06:45.927
is Alex, so I'm gonna search
every damn level

06:45.970 --> 06:47.494
of this inferno till I find him.

06:47.537 --> 06:50.322
If we split up, we'll
find Alex twice as fast.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.721
I'm so proud of you.

06:57.765 --> 06:59.375
Look, I know that
the next few days

06:59.419 --> 07:01.682
are gonna be hard, but we'll
get through it together.

07:07.644 --> 07:10.604
Can I have a few minutes?
Clear my head?

07:14.782 --> 07:16.914
What's in the closet, Liz?

07:20.004 --> 07:22.224
It's one of
my old hidey-holes, <i>obvio.</i>

07:22.267 --> 07:24.531
- That's not what this is about.
- Seriously, Liz?

07:24.574 --> 07:25.619
I'm not ready.

07:26.489 --> 07:27.925
There's too much at stake.

07:27.969 --> 07:29.144
Give me the canister, Rosa,

07:29.187 --> 07:30.711
or I will take it from you.

07:32.974 --> 07:34.236
How's Tezca doing?

07:34.279 --> 07:36.107
She's good, yeah.
She's laying low.

07:36.151 --> 07:37.979
You know,
she's processing years

07:38.022 --> 07:39.415
of repressed
traumatic memories,

07:39.459 --> 07:41.330
but I think
we're making progress, so...

07:41.373 --> 07:42.679
She has a very
good teacher.

07:43.985 --> 07:45.508
Thank you.

07:48.642 --> 07:51.645
Iz, I've been doing
some thinking,

07:51.688 --> 07:53.821
and...
Me, too.

07:53.864 --> 07:55.518
Yeah. Oh, sorry.
You go first.

07:55.562 --> 07:58.565
Okay. Um...

07:58.608 --> 08:00.436
Well, I'm not sure
if you've noticed,

08:00.480 --> 08:03.047
but, since Mexico,
things between us

08:03.091 --> 08:04.962
have kind of been... Awkward.

08:05.006 --> 08:06.747
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Uncomfortable.

08:06.790 --> 08:08.183
Stiff.

08:09.532 --> 08:10.881
Well, uh, you know,
probably could've used

08:10.925 --> 08:12.187
a different adjective
for that one, but...

08:13.754 --> 08:15.843
Our friendship is
important to me. Yeah.

08:15.886 --> 08:17.671
And I don't want us
to keep our distance

08:17.714 --> 08:20.151
or act weird
around each other. No.

08:20.195 --> 08:23.503
So, can we just
go back to being...

08:23.546 --> 08:27.942
"drinking slash occasional
surgery" buddies?

08:27.985 --> 08:30.118
♪ Anywhere you go

08:30.161 --> 08:31.859
♪ I'll follow you down...

08:31.902 --> 08:33.382
Yes, absolutely.

08:33.425 --> 08:34.949
That's funny.
That's actually...

08:34.992 --> 08:37.255
That was exactly what
I was gonna say.

08:37.299 --> 08:38.343
Okay.

08:38.387 --> 08:39.910
Buddy.

08:42.304 --> 08:43.958
Hey.

08:44.001 --> 08:45.829
Are, uh, Liz and Rosa
not down yet?

08:45.873 --> 08:47.744
No.

08:54.011 --> 08:55.796
Hey, Liz?

08:57.667 --> 09:00.017
Hey, what happened?

09:01.497 --> 09:03.847
Max. Um...

09:03.891 --> 09:05.066
Where's-where's Liz?

09:05.109 --> 09:07.808
I-I... I found her secret stash,

09:07.851 --> 09:10.027
and then we started
arguing, and...

09:10.071 --> 09:11.681
it's gone, so she must've

09:11.725 --> 09:14.728
knocked me out with that lamp,
I guess, and...

09:14.771 --> 09:16.556
Max, she wasn't ready.

09:16.599 --> 09:18.862
She's relapsed.

09:24.128 --> 09:27.262
No signs of head trauma
from what I can see.

09:27.305 --> 09:28.916
Why does my brain still feel
like scrambled eggs?

09:28.959 --> 09:31.658
The CT scans
will show us more,

09:31.701 --> 09:33.529
but you should take it easy
for a while.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.705
God, I made the oldest
rookie mistake in the book:

09:35.749 --> 09:37.620
never trust the word
of an addict.

09:37.664 --> 09:40.580
Hey, Max will find her.

09:40.623 --> 09:42.494
Yeah, but, I mean,

09:42.538 --> 09:44.714
a sponsor should be
on solid ground.

09:44.758 --> 09:46.281
Maybe Liz was right.

09:46.324 --> 09:47.630
I'm so early
into my recovery.

09:47.674 --> 09:49.589
I mean, how
can you start

09:49.632 --> 09:51.852
your new life when your old one
feels impossible to shake?

09:51.895 --> 09:54.158
Liz's failures are not yours.

09:54.202 --> 09:56.030
All of us have seen
how much you've grown.

09:56.073 --> 09:57.945
Roswell will remind you
of who you were,

09:57.988 --> 10:00.208
but it'll also show you
how far you've come.

10:00.251 --> 10:01.862
Hmm.

10:03.080 --> 10:05.213
Is that how you felt coming back
from the motherland?

10:05.256 --> 10:07.998
Because Maria told me that
the Valenti family reunion

10:08.042 --> 10:09.652
turned a little <i>picante</i>

10:09.696 --> 10:12.220
when Isobel showed up
in Careyes. Yeah.

10:12.263 --> 10:14.831
Well, feelings were confessed,

10:14.875 --> 10:18.008
but, apparently, Isobel and I
work better as friends.

10:20.402 --> 10:21.795
That's odd.

10:21.838 --> 10:23.666
Your scans show no sign
of a concussion.

10:23.710 --> 10:25.102
That doesn't make sense.

10:25.146 --> 10:26.538
If there's nothing wrong
with my brain,

10:26.582 --> 10:27.801
why can't I remember
what happened?

10:27.844 --> 10:29.672
Maybe it's not human science

10:29.716 --> 10:31.152
we should be looking at.

10:46.080 --> 10:48.386
Finally, she awakens.

10:49.823 --> 10:51.215
Where's my sister?

10:51.259 --> 10:53.391
Still at that
mockery of a diner,

10:53.435 --> 10:54.741
I presume.

10:54.784 --> 10:56.568
You're the only
Ortecho I need.

10:56.612 --> 10:58.701
What is this place?

10:58.745 --> 11:00.660
This mine shaft
is under farmland

11:00.703 --> 11:05.055
that was owned by
Mr. Jones himself in 1947.

11:05.099 --> 11:07.667
This flower grew
from his remains.

11:07.710 --> 11:12.367
Here, where Jones first began
our quest home,

11:12.410 --> 11:15.065
his spirit will guide me
to finish the work he started.

11:15.109 --> 11:17.720
And by Liz Ortecho'shands,

11:17.764 --> 11:20.636
the alighting will begin.

11:22.812 --> 11:24.466
Alex? Alex?

11:25.467 --> 11:28.557
Gosh. I thought for sure
he would be in here.

11:28.600 --> 11:29.950
He could live off of
buttered popcorn

11:29.993 --> 11:31.734
and pineapple gummy bears
for weeks.

11:33.518 --> 11:36.957
All right, come on,
let's keep searching before

11:37.000 --> 11:39.786
- whatever that is rolls in.
- Wait, wait, wait.

11:39.829 --> 11:42.832
If it storms in here,
maybe Alex sought shelter.

11:42.876 --> 11:44.616
Come on.

11:47.968 --> 11:49.752
No. It's not here.

11:49.796 --> 11:51.232
Hey, hold up.

11:51.275 --> 11:53.713
Is that alien glass?

11:56.498 --> 11:59.327
Maybe my dad left
another message.

12:01.111 --> 12:03.070
What was that?

12:03.113 --> 12:05.246
Uh...

12:05.289 --> 12:08.466
Maybe I tripped a wire
or something.

12:09.946 --> 12:11.948
I'll get us
out of here.

12:16.039 --> 12:18.128
It's not working.

12:18.172 --> 12:20.522
Wait, these old shipping
containers are coated in lead.

12:20.565 --> 12:23.481
That means electromagnetic waves
can't pass through them.

12:23.525 --> 12:24.961
What does that mean?

12:25.005 --> 12:26.615
When I first got inducted
into the pod squad,

12:26.658 --> 12:29.226
Michael told me that
our powers are electromagnetic.

12:29.270 --> 12:30.706
So we're trapped.

12:32.186 --> 12:35.363
My savior set this plan
in motion many moons ago.

12:35.406 --> 12:37.582
As soon as the ship
crashed in 1947,

12:37.626 --> 12:39.976
he began devising a way
to return home with his clone.

12:40.020 --> 12:43.632
Jones aligned himself with one
of the most esteemed scientists

12:43.675 --> 12:45.547
on Oasis,

12:45.590 --> 12:47.157
the traitor you call Theo.

12:47.201 --> 12:48.898
Theo built the portal for Jones.

12:48.942 --> 12:51.161
What he built was
purposely broken.

12:51.205 --> 12:53.120
In his transmission from
the Lockhart machine,

12:53.163 --> 12:57.254
my savior said your
brilliant mind could fix it.

12:57.298 --> 12:59.039
I'm not an engineer.

12:59.082 --> 13:01.868
My expertise
is limited to genetics.

13:01.911 --> 13:04.653
And that's exactly why
you're so important.

13:05.872 --> 13:09.832
This mark bonds
select members of Ophiuchus,

13:09.876 --> 13:11.442
makes us a family.

13:11.486 --> 13:13.749
But anyone who bears it
will never be able

13:13.793 --> 13:16.752
to use Theo's portal to
return home to Oasis.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.885
So it's not just a regular
drunken night tattoo?

13:20.712 --> 13:23.498
This brand is infused
with Oasian glass.

13:23.541 --> 13:25.239
It created a bond
that allowed me

13:25.282 --> 13:27.110
to draw energy from my savior.

13:27.154 --> 13:29.591
I need you to use
your genetic expertise

13:29.634 --> 13:32.115
to counteract
Theo's defenses.

13:32.159 --> 13:34.378
And then you walk through
the liminal space

13:34.422 --> 13:36.380
- into a portal back to Oasis?
- No.

13:36.424 --> 13:38.121
The liminal space was a trick

13:38.165 --> 13:40.384
Theo created
to deceive my savior.

13:40.428 --> 13:42.430
The only portal I need
is right here in Roswell.

13:42.473 --> 13:44.649
I plug in
the star map...

13:46.173 --> 13:48.175
...set a course
for Oasis,

13:48.218 --> 13:51.526
and I walk away from
this miserable rock for good.

13:52.570 --> 13:54.181
How does that work exactly?

13:57.314 --> 13:59.229
The only answersyou need

13:59.273 --> 14:01.884
lie in the traitor's bible.

14:01.928 --> 14:04.017
I took the liberty of
translating the Oasian symbols

14:04.060 --> 14:06.149
- for you.
- Okay, why would I ever help you?

14:06.193 --> 14:08.760
'Cause a certain
spitfire waitress's life

14:08.804 --> 14:10.066
depends on it.

14:11.459 --> 14:12.677
Vanessa.

14:12.721 --> 14:14.288
That's how
you kidnapped me.

14:14.331 --> 14:15.811
You mind-controlled her.

14:17.639 --> 14:19.902
She sure works around
a lot of knives.

14:19.946 --> 14:21.730
It'd be a real shame

14:21.773 --> 14:24.341
if she suddenly got the impulse
to slit her wrists.

14:26.343 --> 14:28.432
But you're brilliant enough
to prevent that from happening.

14:50.367 --> 14:52.282
Excuse you.

14:52.326 --> 14:54.937
That wasn't finished.

14:54.981 --> 14:56.330
Liz give you those?

14:56.373 --> 14:57.635
Insisted against it, actually.

14:57.679 --> 14:59.246
I made
an executive decision.

14:59.289 --> 15:01.117
My team relocated them
this morning.

15:01.161 --> 15:03.859
- So you stole them.
- Liz was being illogical.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.079
Your eggs
are much safer here.

15:06.122 --> 15:10.257
I have the best security
that money can buy, and...

15:10.300 --> 15:12.172
I'm gonna call them now, actually,

15:12.215 --> 15:14.391
to find out why the sheriff
got in here without a warrant.

15:14.435 --> 15:16.306
I think you'llfind out

15:16.350 --> 15:18.961
your chief of security has taken
a temporary leave of absence.

15:19.005 --> 15:21.355
Isobel Evans, chief of security.

15:21.398 --> 15:23.966
I think it's time
you and I had a chat.

15:29.537 --> 15:30.973
I'm looking for Liz.

15:31.017 --> 15:32.366
Well, you won't find her here.

15:32.409 --> 15:34.324
My mentee abandoned me
on the brink

15:34.368 --> 15:35.935
of an incredible discovery.

15:35.978 --> 15:38.328
More like on the brink
of self-destruction.

15:38.372 --> 15:41.331
That mist that you made,
it's ruining her,

15:41.375 --> 15:43.159
and from the looks of it,
it's doing the same to you.

15:43.203 --> 15:44.813
This is a drug bust.

15:44.856 --> 15:47.207
I just want what's mine. <i>Au contraire.</i>

15:47.250 --> 15:49.426
That's my proprietary formula.

15:49.470 --> 15:52.603
- Made with my pods.
- They're not iPhones.

15:52.647 --> 15:53.996
But I have a friend at
the FBI, Agent Cameron,

15:54.040 --> 15:55.302
who would be
very, very interested

15:55.345 --> 15:56.694
in the secrets
you're keeping here.

15:56.738 --> 15:58.000
You are not the only one
with friends

15:58.044 --> 15:59.610
in high places, Sheriff.

15:59.654 --> 16:02.526
One phone call to
Director Whitman at the Bureau,

16:02.570 --> 16:04.876
and your secrets
are also exposed.

16:07.140 --> 16:10.491
Well, then let's end
this chess match.

16:10.534 --> 16:12.884
One canister.

16:12.928 --> 16:14.495
That is all I'm asking.

16:14.538 --> 16:16.627
Here I was thought
you wanted to flush

16:16.671 --> 16:19.326
your girlfriend's pills
down the toilet,

16:19.369 --> 16:21.545
but you want the mist
for yourself.

16:22.807 --> 16:24.722
Let me guess.

16:24.766 --> 16:27.638
Now that the mist
has unburdened Liz

16:27.682 --> 16:30.032
of her irrational emotions,

16:30.076 --> 16:32.600
she finally sees you
for who you are:

16:32.643 --> 16:34.384
dead weight.

16:34.428 --> 16:35.951
If that's how you see
relationships, it's no mystery

16:35.995 --> 16:38.214
why Allie disappeared
into Mexico.

16:38.258 --> 16:41.000
You're not exactly a
qualified couples therapist.

16:41.043 --> 16:43.002
Therapy's for dwelling
in the past.

16:43.045 --> 16:44.394
I prefer the future.

16:44.438 --> 16:46.440
Care to know
what's in store for you?

16:47.789 --> 16:49.660
- So you're a psychic now?
- Better.

16:49.704 --> 16:52.707
That mist has made my brain
capable of running simulations

16:52.750 --> 16:54.796
that would give a supercomputer
a migraine.

16:54.839 --> 16:57.103
This isn't a simulation.
This is real life.

16:57.146 --> 16:59.061
Maybe you'd like to join it!

16:59.105 --> 17:03.022
Real life? Which is governed
by physics, chemistry, biology.

17:03.065 --> 17:05.198
Equal and opposite reactions.
Cause and effect.

17:05.241 --> 17:07.939
Our entire lives
written into our very DNA

17:07.983 --> 17:09.724
before we even take
a first step.

17:09.767 --> 17:12.031
One big chain reaction
leading to one

17:12.074 --> 17:15.164
inevitable conclusion.

17:15.208 --> 17:18.037
There is no future together
for Max Evans and Liz Ortecho.

17:20.474 --> 17:22.215
Wow.

17:22.258 --> 17:25.261
I am so sick of people
telling me what my future is.

17:25.305 --> 17:27.263
I'm gonna take my fate
into my own hands,

17:27.307 --> 17:29.961
so give me the mist.

17:33.661 --> 17:35.706
Your sister may be able
to restrain one guard,

17:35.750 --> 17:37.882
but can she take on all four?

17:43.584 --> 17:46.021
Theo's equations
are entirely theoretical.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.501
T-To understand
the practical components,

17:47.544 --> 17:48.632
I need my equipment
at Senovative.

17:48.676 --> 17:50.547
If I could call Shivani...

17:50.591 --> 17:52.897
And let you run straight back
into the arms of Clone-Cop?

17:52.941 --> 17:56.727
Before Tezca betrayed our cause,
we collected all that was needed

17:56.771 --> 17:58.468
per our savior's
instructions.

17:58.512 --> 18:00.166
Unless there's

18:00.209 --> 18:01.906
something else
from Senovative you crave?

18:04.605 --> 18:07.042
Weren't you and your sister
bickering over this?

18:10.089 --> 18:11.742
Evolution in one breath.

18:11.786 --> 18:13.135
That's quite
a novel approach

18:13.179 --> 18:14.919
to improving your kind's
deficiencies.

18:14.963 --> 18:17.400
You know, the savior
also sought science to ascend.

18:17.444 --> 18:18.575
I am nothing like Jones.

18:18.619 --> 18:20.142
He was a monster

18:20.186 --> 18:22.492
whose greed
destroyed everyone in his world,

18:22.536 --> 18:25.756
and I will not drug myself
so that you can destroy mine.

18:27.149 --> 18:29.760
Ophiuchus teaches us
that the only true monsters

18:29.804 --> 18:31.327
are those who sit
on the sidelines

18:31.371 --> 18:32.589
and refuse their purpose.

18:32.633 --> 18:33.982
From what I gather,

18:34.025 --> 18:35.766
you and I have found
a common ground.

18:35.810 --> 18:37.942
I took the mist
to protect my friends.

18:37.986 --> 18:40.858
I don't judge you for wanting
to reach your full potential.

18:40.902 --> 18:43.252
In fact, I encourage
you to embrace it.

18:43.296 --> 18:45.863
Besides, what other
option is there?

18:55.438 --> 18:58.180
And you're sure this short-term
memory loss isn't a byproduct

18:58.224 --> 19:00.530
of Liz's
drug and ditch?

19:00.574 --> 19:01.792
I tripled-checked
my work.

19:01.836 --> 19:03.316
Oh, no, of
course you did.

19:03.359 --> 19:05.100
I know that you're
very good at your job.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.928
I didn't mean that... Oh, I didn't think you were,

19:06.971 --> 19:08.277
- like, doubting me in any way.
- No, of course I wouldn't

19:08.321 --> 19:10.105
doubt you.
I trust you with my life.

19:10.149 --> 19:11.672
Right.Not to make this
all about me,

19:11.715 --> 19:14.196
but my memory loss
seems to clearly be

19:14.240 --> 19:15.589
a nonconsensual close encounter

19:15.632 --> 19:17.330
of the third kind,
so could you just

19:17.373 --> 19:19.506
hop in my mind and see
- what happened?
- Yeah.

19:19.549 --> 19:21.377
Of course. Sorry.

19:22.857 --> 19:23.945
Cool if I join?

19:23.988 --> 19:25.164
Just figured
we should

19:25.207 --> 19:26.643
all know
what we're dealing with.

19:28.776 --> 19:30.952
- Oh.
- We should all know, yes.

19:32.780 --> 19:35.783
What's the last thing
you remember with you and Liz?

19:39.700 --> 19:41.223
Give me the canister, Rosa,

19:41.267 --> 19:42.833
or I will take it
from you.

19:42.877 --> 19:44.008
You might be the brains
of the family,

19:44.052 --> 19:45.706
but I'm the brawn. Try me.

19:45.749 --> 19:47.925
You're wasting our time.
I'll figure out how to get some.

19:47.969 --> 19:49.927
I can't let you leave.

19:52.452 --> 19:54.671
Oh, my God.
What did you do?

19:55.672 --> 19:57.108
Not that one.

20:03.637 --> 20:04.725
Forget.

20:09.425 --> 20:11.993
Liz didn't ditch.
Clyde took her.

20:12.036 --> 20:14.256
Okay, we have to go
to the Crashdown.

20:14.300 --> 20:15.910
Help!

20:15.953 --> 20:18.913
Michael! Somebody, help us!

20:18.956 --> 20:20.958
You might want to try
and save your strength.

20:21.002 --> 20:23.570
How can you be so calm?

20:23.613 --> 20:25.093
It's my severe lack of chill
that got us stuck

20:25.136 --> 20:26.225
in here in the first place.

20:26.268 --> 20:27.965
I've become so obsessed

20:28.009 --> 20:31.447
with following my dad's trail
of bread crumbs to Oasis

20:31.491 --> 20:33.188
that I'm falling
for ACME booby traps.

20:33.232 --> 20:36.235
Well, we do
crazy things for family.

20:36.278 --> 20:38.715
I used to be a preacher.

20:38.759 --> 20:40.674
You know, God was
my shepherd.

20:40.717 --> 20:43.024
But what if I've strayed
too far from the flock?

20:43.067 --> 20:44.808
If my dad's plan
for me keeps putting

20:44.852 --> 20:46.810
people that I care about
in danger,

20:46.854 --> 20:48.595
how can I place faith in that?

20:48.638 --> 20:52.251
The good shepherd lays down
his life for the sheep.

20:52.294 --> 20:53.687
You're quoting Scripture
at me now?

20:53.730 --> 20:55.079
Well, our Triad
used a revivalist church

20:55.123 --> 20:56.211
as home base.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.473
I'm a quick study.

20:57.517 --> 20:59.345
Your dad did everything he could

20:59.388 --> 21:00.781
to protect you from Jones,

21:00.824 --> 21:02.609
to give you a future.

21:02.652 --> 21:04.828
That sounds like
a pretty good shepherd to me.

21:07.440 --> 21:11.226
You know, whoever did this,
they could've gotten to Alex.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.662
Maybe we haven't found him
because he...

21:12.706 --> 21:13.881
Alex isn't dead.

21:15.099 --> 21:17.232
Hey, uh, don't go
blaming yourself.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.886
You didn't put Alex
in that sinkhole.

21:18.929 --> 21:20.322
Yeah, it may not be my fault,

21:20.366 --> 21:21.671
but I still have to
make it right.

21:21.715 --> 21:24.413
Alex and Michael
are each other's family.

21:24.457 --> 21:26.285
We do crazy things for family.

21:28.330 --> 21:30.332
My own mother disowned me.

21:30.376 --> 21:32.334
When I thought that
I had finally found

21:32.378 --> 21:36.120
what I was missing in Ophiuchus,
even they kept me at a distance.

21:37.078 --> 21:38.862
The dictator wanted
to use my powers,

21:38.906 --> 21:40.603
but he was afraid of them, too.

21:40.647 --> 21:43.780
I never received the mark
of his followers,

21:43.824 --> 21:45.086
his family.

21:46.130 --> 21:48.045
Think you dodged a bullet there.

21:48.089 --> 21:49.873
But more importantly,

21:49.917 --> 21:51.701
the pod squad's your family now.

21:52.702 --> 21:54.095
And they will
welcome you

21:54.138 --> 21:56.358
like a long-lost sibling...

21:56.402 --> 21:58.708
when we get out of here.

21:58.752 --> 22:00.275
Come on.

22:04.366 --> 22:06.847
- Michael!
- Michael!

22:09.632 --> 22:11.373
Help!
Hello?

22:13.157 --> 22:14.985
Help!

22:15.029 --> 22:16.378
Michael?

22:25.300 --> 22:27.389
At least kiss me
before you bust my lip.

22:34.396 --> 22:37.094
I cannot believe that
it's actually you.

22:37.138 --> 22:39.314
I'm just so happy
you found me.

22:40.968 --> 22:42.752
I knew you had to
be here somewhere.

22:42.796 --> 22:44.928
I'm here.

22:44.972 --> 22:46.234
You're here.

22:47.235 --> 22:48.889
Where is here
exactly?

22:48.932 --> 22:51.935
My dad created this space
as a kind of

22:51.979 --> 22:54.111
inter-dimensional
mousetrap for

22:54.155 --> 22:55.939
Jones and his merry band
of followers.

22:55.983 --> 22:57.898
Speaking of traps,

22:57.941 --> 22:59.508
apparently he wasn't
the only one.

22:59.552 --> 23:01.554
I just knew I needed
the upper hand, and alien glass

23:01.597 --> 23:03.077
seemed like
the perfect bait

23:03.120 --> 23:05.079
in this lead-based
shipping container.

23:05.122 --> 23:06.994
It was a perfect
premade Faraday cage.

23:07.037 --> 23:09.475
You built an alien roach motel
where powers wouldn't work?

23:10.693 --> 23:14.175
Yeah, it's good
to see friends, old and new.

23:16.612 --> 23:18.092
I got to admit, I... I was

23:18.135 --> 23:19.485
beginning to think
that I never would.

23:20.834 --> 23:22.923
Then I remembered
what you said.

23:22.966 --> 23:25.316
No matter
how far apart we are,

23:25.360 --> 23:27.406
we'll always find our way
back to each other.

23:31.322 --> 23:34.456
Well, we couldn't have done it
without Maria's help.

23:34.500 --> 23:35.936
How'd you reach out
to her anyway?

23:35.979 --> 23:38.591
Well, when I first got here,

23:38.634 --> 23:41.245
I was looking
for anything familiar.

23:41.289 --> 23:44.640
The diner, the gazebo,
this drive-in.

23:44.684 --> 23:47.338
Everything was stuck
in the 1940s,

23:47.382 --> 23:48.862
except for when
I got to our house.

23:48.905 --> 23:50.472
It wasn't stuck
in Un-Pleasantville?

23:50.516 --> 23:51.865
It was,
but then I remembered

23:51.908 --> 23:53.606
reading something
in the files at Deep Sky

23:53.649 --> 23:56.217
about conscious communication
through realities.

23:56.260 --> 23:57.958
I mean, it was
all theoretical until...

23:58.001 --> 23:59.829
Until Maria made it real.

23:59.873 --> 24:01.527
Yeah, I think
she was the conduit.

24:01.570 --> 24:04.573
I saw her standing in
our living room with our things.

24:04.617 --> 24:06.619
It was like she was shining
a spotlight on the world

24:06.662 --> 24:08.403
that I so desperately wanted
to get back to.

24:08.447 --> 24:10.144
I had to get
my message across.

24:10.187 --> 24:11.450
I had to get
out of here.

24:13.060 --> 24:14.540
Mm.

24:14.583 --> 24:17.804
When did Hurricane Theo
appear on the radar?

24:17.847 --> 24:19.719
I've been studying this place,
trying to understand it,

24:19.762 --> 24:21.547
but this storm is new.

24:21.590 --> 24:23.766
I noticed a steep drop
in barometric pressure

24:23.810 --> 24:26.465
- last night.
- Have you seen any, um...

24:26.508 --> 24:29.206
alien fruit
since you've been here?

24:29.250 --> 24:30.730
I saw a grove

24:30.773 --> 24:32.819
of weird-looking trees
about ten miles east. Why?

24:32.862 --> 24:35.691
Turns out inter-dimensional
travel runs on green energy

24:35.735 --> 24:37.650
and lots of it.

24:37.693 --> 24:39.042
That fruit's our ticket out.

24:39.086 --> 24:41.262
Okay, then I'll take you.

24:41.305 --> 24:42.568
Well, can you make a map?

24:42.611 --> 24:44.395
Dallas and I will go.

24:44.439 --> 24:46.615
You two deserve a chance
to catch up.

25:26.916 --> 25:28.875
What do you think
you're doing?

25:28.918 --> 25:31.617
Theo's notes call for a compound
that's only found on Oasis,

25:31.660 --> 25:33.227
and we need to figure out
an Earth equivalent.

25:33.270 --> 25:35.229
I need ferric oxide, i.e. rust.

25:35.272 --> 25:37.231
You want your damn tattoo
removed or not?

25:44.630 --> 25:47.284
Need I remind you what happens
to Vanessa if you fail

25:47.328 --> 25:49.156
- to produce results?
- It'll take me 33 minutes

25:49.199 --> 25:51.158
and 29 seconds
to develop a serum

25:51.201 --> 25:52.725
that'll circumvent
Theo's defenses,

25:52.768 --> 25:54.030
give or take the ten seconds
I just wasted

25:54.074 --> 25:55.031
explaining it to you.

25:55.075 --> 25:56.946
Pace yourself.

25:56.990 --> 25:58.034
The mist isn't for me.

25:58.078 --> 25:59.775
I created it by

25:59.819 --> 26:01.690
genetically altering the enzymes
in an alien test subject,

26:01.734 --> 26:02.952
and it's gonna help me
alter the mark.

26:02.996 --> 26:04.780
I'm going
to get the rust.

26:12.527 --> 26:14.398
CLYDE:Your restraint
is impressive.

26:14.442 --> 26:16.313
Those overpowered
by their vices

26:16.357 --> 26:18.011
were a strain
on our civilization.

26:18.054 --> 26:19.752
The savior mercifully put an end
to their misery.

26:19.795 --> 26:21.667
But he spared your life?

26:21.710 --> 26:25.540
I have always kept my mind
and my body pure for Ophiuchus.

26:25.584 --> 26:27.716
Fanaticism is no different.

26:27.760 --> 26:32.547
You pushed the one person who
cares about you down a sinkhole

26:32.591 --> 26:35.158
because of your obsession
with Jones's cult.

26:35.202 --> 26:38.553
You will return to Oasis alone,

26:38.597 --> 26:39.902
no Triad.

26:39.946 --> 26:42.209
I am never alone.

26:43.340 --> 26:44.733
My savior is
always with me.

26:44.777 --> 26:45.952
How does he still have
a hold on you

26:45.995 --> 26:47.127
even in death?

26:48.868 --> 26:50.913
Ophiuchus was a method
of manipulation.

26:50.957 --> 26:52.523
Jones created
a religion

26:52.567 --> 26:54.787
of corrupted ideas
to amass power,

26:54.830 --> 26:57.703
and that mark
on your shoulder,

26:57.746 --> 27:00.836
it's a brand,
because he owns you

27:00.880 --> 27:02.664
like cattle.

27:02.708 --> 27:05.232
This is the symbol for
the children of Ophiuchus.

27:05.275 --> 27:08.278
Designed by
a self-serving father.

27:08.322 --> 27:09.889
He told you
it would make you stronger,

27:09.932 --> 27:12.065
but the truth is
he was leeching off of

27:12.108 --> 27:14.023
his chosen people.

27:14.067 --> 27:15.329
Bonnie saw the truth.

27:15.372 --> 27:17.244
Tezca broke free from his lies.

27:17.287 --> 27:18.506
You can, too.

27:18.549 --> 27:20.116
They were traitors.

27:20.160 --> 27:21.814
They were
your friends once.

27:21.857 --> 27:24.773
They aren't the ones
with the problem. You are.

27:24.817 --> 27:26.470
You have 33 minutes

27:26.514 --> 27:28.559
and 29 seconds
to finish this job,

27:28.603 --> 27:31.562
or else Vanessa goes splat
off that roof.

27:38.091 --> 27:40.006
- Vanessa, get down!
- Whoa.

27:40.049 --> 27:41.964
I'm trying to, but I can't.

27:43.618 --> 27:46.055
There's some creepy voice
in my head telling me to jump.

27:47.361 --> 27:49.668
Okay, just take it easy.

27:49.711 --> 27:51.147
Stop, stop! He said...

27:52.758 --> 27:54.629
He said if you move me, he'll...

27:55.456 --> 27:57.501
Oh, God, please help me!
I don't want to die!

27:59.808 --> 28:02.681
Any ideas?
Liz figured out
that resonate frequencies

28:02.724 --> 28:04.900
can break psychic tethers
and, with four roommates,

28:04.944 --> 28:06.946
I've gotten kind of good
at silencing them, so maybe.

28:06.989 --> 28:09.252
- So you think it'll work?
- I can't let Vanessa lose her life

28:09.296 --> 28:10.732
because I'm afraid to try.

28:10.776 --> 28:12.255
Give it a shot.

28:19.088 --> 28:21.134
I'm almost locked in.

28:25.834 --> 28:28.010
The frequency's destabilizing.

28:28.054 --> 28:30.491
KYLE:Keep going. She's pretty
unstable up there herself.

28:34.713 --> 28:36.758
Ooh.

28:36.802 --> 28:38.194
It's kind of romantic,
isn't it?

28:38.238 --> 28:40.022
Yeah.

28:40.066 --> 28:42.155
Who needs a sunset
when you got permanent midnight

28:42.198 --> 28:43.765
under a starless sky?

28:43.809 --> 28:46.376
No, I mean just
being here together.

28:46.420 --> 28:49.815
You might say that our first
real date was at the drive-in.

28:49.858 --> 28:51.120
You're calling that a date?

28:52.165 --> 28:54.080
I seem to remember you
telling me off

28:54.123 --> 28:55.690
about some
stolen copper wire.

28:55.734 --> 28:58.519
Well, I didn't say
it was perfect. Mm.

28:58.562 --> 29:00.651
What about our relationship
ever has been?

29:02.131 --> 29:04.612
All of these restless
nights, I just

29:04.655 --> 29:07.180
sat looking at
this blank screen,

29:07.223 --> 29:09.486
imagining that this nightmare
was just a movie

29:09.530 --> 29:11.184
about star-crossed lovers.

29:11.227 --> 29:13.447
I'd sit here dreaming
about getting home to you,

29:13.490 --> 29:14.970
and I could
picture you perfectly

29:15.014 --> 29:16.276
on the other side
doing the same.

29:19.845 --> 29:22.325
Think I got to ruin
another night at the drive-in.

29:24.284 --> 29:26.547
I was dreaming of going home...

29:28.897 --> 29:30.638
...but I forgot
where home really is.

29:32.292 --> 29:34.076
See, I met this guy...

29:34.120 --> 29:36.731
What?
You met a guy?

29:36.775 --> 29:39.212
Not like that.
Clyde. He's an alien.

29:39.255 --> 29:41.867
And he-he showed me Oasis.

29:41.910 --> 29:44.957
Not the real place,
but there is a way to...

29:45.000 --> 29:47.220
Go back to your planet.

29:53.966 --> 29:57.404
I told myself I was just
milking him for information.

30:00.581 --> 30:02.278
But the truth is I was tempted.

30:02.322 --> 30:05.542
I hate myself for letting
that fantasy distract

30:05.586 --> 30:08.197
from we have built together
on our planet.

30:09.459 --> 30:11.200
I mean, I can't say
I'm surprised

30:11.244 --> 30:12.854
- because I know you,
- Michael.

30:12.898 --> 30:14.725
You've been searching
for home since we met.

30:18.207 --> 30:19.905
Look, Oasis, Roswell--

30:19.948 --> 30:23.038
I don't care if we are on
other sides of the universe.

30:23.082 --> 30:25.824
As long as we are looking
at the same stars...

30:27.129 --> 30:29.044
...I will never
look away.

30:46.627 --> 30:48.324
So, this movie...

30:49.848 --> 30:51.110
...how does it end?

30:51.153 --> 30:53.721
Pick your favorite sci-fi trope.

30:53.764 --> 30:55.418
We could, um,
detonate the asteroid

30:55.462 --> 30:56.985
heading towards Earth,

30:57.029 --> 30:59.292
shut down the giant lizard
destroying the city,

30:59.335 --> 31:02.556
or it can end
with a twist.

31:08.301 --> 31:09.955
Michael Guerin...

31:11.739 --> 31:13.915
...will you marry me?

31:23.707 --> 31:27.059
This isn't where I imagined our
engagement photos either, but...

31:27.102 --> 31:29.452
I couldn't wait.

31:29.496 --> 31:31.585
We've already spent
too much time apart.

31:34.327 --> 31:35.806
So?

31:38.853 --> 31:41.247
I can't wait
to see Sanders in a tux.

31:42.465 --> 31:45.686
Yes.

31:45.729 --> 31:48.036
I am so in love with you
it's embarrassing.

31:49.429 --> 31:51.300
I love you, too.

31:53.737 --> 31:55.261
How far did you say
those trees were?

31:55.304 --> 31:56.697
Like, ten miles.

31:56.740 --> 31:59.482
Yeah, we could work
with that.

31:59.526 --> 32:02.094
Whoa.

32:02.137 --> 32:03.399
I got to wait
till the honeymoon?

32:03.443 --> 32:06.185
No. It's just, um...

32:11.320 --> 32:14.149
If this is
an alternate dimension,

32:14.193 --> 32:16.586
the amount of energy that
it would take to build it

32:16.630 --> 32:18.371
would border on atomic fission.

32:20.068 --> 32:22.941
And like nuclear power,

32:22.984 --> 32:25.291
it would have
unintended consequences.

32:27.206 --> 32:28.424
Radiation.

32:28.468 --> 32:30.600
The gas mask.

32:30.644 --> 32:33.777
I felt nauseous
as soon as I got here.

32:33.821 --> 32:35.866
Did you?
Dallas, Bonnie?

32:37.172 --> 32:40.132
Okay, so it's
only humans.

32:40.175 --> 32:41.785
Which is why Theo
didn't realize.

32:41.829 --> 32:44.266
Realize what?
What are you saying?

32:44.310 --> 32:46.225
The gas mask helped
with the nausea,

32:46.268 --> 32:48.575
but it-it couldn't
stop this.

32:54.059 --> 32:56.496
I think I'm dying.

33:04.199 --> 33:05.984
This is where Liz is?
Yeah.

33:06.027 --> 33:09.248
I mean, Tezca said Clyde was
Ophiuchus's most loyal disciple.

33:09.291 --> 33:10.553
I don't think he could
resist a pilgrimage

33:10.597 --> 33:11.728
to the mecca of Jones.

33:11.772 --> 33:13.730
Cults do lovea farm.

33:13.774 --> 33:16.951
You know, considering that we
are attempting an alien ambush,

33:16.995 --> 33:19.171
right now might be
the time to, um,

33:19.214 --> 33:20.650
huff the magic dragon.

33:22.130 --> 33:25.351
Shivani's security swarmed me
before I could get the mist.

33:25.394 --> 33:27.005
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

33:27.048 --> 33:28.745
Rosa needed me...
No, no, no.

33:28.789 --> 33:31.357
If you hadn't helped Rosa,
we wouldn't know where Liz was.

33:31.400 --> 33:33.185
So...

33:34.664 --> 33:36.405
I just can't lose her, Iz.

33:36.449 --> 33:37.841
We're gonna find her.

33:51.594 --> 33:54.336

back to Oasis.

33:54.380 --> 33:56.599
CLYDE:Yeah, those, uh,
trembling hands

33:56.643 --> 33:58.384
won't be doing anything.

33:58.427 --> 34:00.995
How do I know
you haven't deceived me?

34:01.039 --> 34:04.129

No.

34:39.164 --> 34:40.469
It's a distraction.

34:48.477 --> 34:50.392
You were right not to trust me.

34:50.436 --> 34:52.742
The mist was synthesized
from Bonnie's virus,

34:52.786 --> 34:54.135
and by reverse engineering
the chemical structure,

34:54.179 --> 34:55.180
I was able to mimic

I'm never gonna leave your side.

35:47.797 --> 35:49.538
You saved me.

35:49.582 --> 35:51.497
No.

35:51.540 --> 35:52.933
You saved yourself.

35:52.976 --> 35:54.239
I was just there
to catch your fall.

35:54.282 --> 35:55.805
Does Rosa hate me?

35:55.849 --> 35:58.199
No, we're all just here
to support you.

35:58.243 --> 36:00.114
Oh, Kyle's putting

36:00.158 --> 36:02.464
the finishing touches
on his detox stuff,

36:02.508 --> 36:05.119
and Rosa's waiting in the wings.

36:05.163 --> 36:06.860
You know, when you stood up

36:06.903 --> 36:08.775
and faced your fears
this morning...

36:10.472 --> 36:12.735
...I thought maybe
I was ready to do the same.

36:12.779 --> 36:14.433
But the mist
had opened

36:14.476 --> 36:17.218
my mind up to endless
possibilities, and I...

36:17.262 --> 36:18.872
I just--
I thought I could use it

36:18.915 --> 36:21.135
- to outsmart him.
- I know.

36:21.179 --> 36:23.006
I'm sorry.

36:23.050 --> 36:25.052
I pushed you all away. I just...

36:27.272 --> 36:30.492
I don't want
to lose myself anymore.

36:31.493 --> 36:33.321
And I don't want to lose you.

36:33.365 --> 36:35.671
Well...

36:35.715 --> 36:37.978
I ain't going anywhere.

36:38.021 --> 36:39.458
All right?

36:39.501 --> 36:41.764
I'm gonna be the man
you need me to be.

36:41.808 --> 36:46.421
Max, I should not have said
that you were holding me back.

36:46.465 --> 36:48.336
Get some rest, okay?

36:49.903 --> 36:51.731
Tomorrow is a new day.

36:55.909 --> 36:57.693
These...

36:57.737 --> 36:59.129
should help ease
her withdrawal

36:59.173 --> 37:00.870
for a couple of hours.

37:00.914 --> 37:02.307
Okay.

37:02.350 --> 37:03.873
Then I'll take it
from there.

37:03.917 --> 37:06.224
There's only so much
that medicine can do,

37:06.267 --> 37:07.703
even the alien kind.

37:07.747 --> 37:09.488
After that, we'll
take it day by day.

37:09.531 --> 37:12.273
Sounds like someone's
back in the sponsor saddle.

37:12.317 --> 37:13.361
Mm-hmm.

37:13.405 --> 37:15.711
For as long
as it takes.

37:18.018 --> 37:20.281
What about New York?

37:20.325 --> 37:21.891
You can't just put
your new life on pause.

37:21.935 --> 37:24.416
We can watch over Liz.
I'll send you updates.

37:24.459 --> 37:28.463
She's been there for me
every time I needed her most.

37:28.507 --> 37:31.423
I can be a little bit patient.

37:31.466 --> 37:34.817
And, by the way,
I think so should you.

37:34.861 --> 37:36.428
Hmm.

37:36.471 --> 37:38.952
With a certain green-eyed
alien warrior goddess

37:38.995 --> 37:41.041
who would give Gamora
a run for her money.

37:42.129 --> 37:44.000
Isobel and I are just friends.

37:44.044 --> 37:48.396
Yeah, I know that you say that,
but is she on the same page?

37:48.440 --> 37:50.093
Because the start of that whole

37:50.137 --> 37:51.791
mindscape trip
was hella awkward.

37:51.834 --> 37:53.271
Look, I get
what it's like

37:53.314 --> 37:55.098
to put a cage
around your heart.

37:55.142 --> 37:57.536
I just don't think now is
the time to throw away the key.

37:57.579 --> 38:00.190
So what do I do, then?

38:00.234 --> 38:01.931
I already told her
where I stand.

38:01.975 --> 38:04.978
Why don't you try talking less
and listening more?

38:11.941 --> 38:13.247
Hey, brother.

38:13.291 --> 38:15.118
Hey, sis.

38:16.903 --> 38:18.731
Any, uh,
sign of Clyde?

38:18.774 --> 38:20.646
Yeah, well, it took me
a little while to figure out

38:20.689 --> 38:22.038
which shaft
he'd hunkered down in.

38:22.082 --> 38:23.431
By the time I got there,

38:23.475 --> 38:25.172
all that was left
was a severed hand.

38:25.215 --> 38:27.696
So, this isn't over, then.

38:27.740 --> 38:31.004
Well, if Liz has a part to play,
I got to play mine.

38:31.047 --> 38:32.962
What about that mist?

38:34.442 --> 38:37.053
I will find a way,
with or without it.

38:37.097 --> 38:39.317
I mean, running away from
my fears almost got Liz killed.

38:39.360 --> 38:41.275
I cannot let that happen again.

38:41.319 --> 38:42.929
Don't be so hard on yourself,
you know.

38:42.972 --> 38:45.932
Losing a love like
you and Liz have, that's...

38:45.975 --> 38:47.368
No, that's terrifying.

38:47.412 --> 38:49.588
Or, uh...

38:49.631 --> 38:50.893
you and Kyle.

38:54.070 --> 38:56.899
Why did it take him
closing the door

38:56.943 --> 38:59.946
for me to realize that...

38:59.989 --> 39:02.818
all I want to do is
dropkick it off its hinges?

39:02.862 --> 39:04.603
So what's stopping you?

39:05.604 --> 39:07.562
I mean, doors are
a part of a relationship.

39:07.606 --> 39:10.739
They close, but they're also
meant to be opened.

39:10.783 --> 39:12.698
I don't know.

39:12.741 --> 39:15.614
I think I've played enough
with that man's emotions.

39:15.657 --> 39:17.398
He made it
pretty clear

39:17.442 --> 39:20.532
that I had, uh...
missed my moment.

39:22.838 --> 39:25.406
Epic love stories aren't made up
of a single moment.

39:25.450 --> 39:28.453
They're built over a lifetime.

39:30.411 --> 39:34.067
I refuse to believe
it's too late, for either of us.

39:35.895 --> 39:37.853
I should've told you
right away.

39:37.897 --> 39:39.681
I just didn't want
to ruin this moment.

39:39.725 --> 39:42.292
You're trying to save my life.
It's already lost.

39:45.078 --> 39:46.819
Are you gonna
say anything?

39:49.604 --> 39:51.650
What do you
want me to say?

39:53.565 --> 39:55.131
Five minutes ago, I was
imagining wedding vows,

39:55.175 --> 39:56.742
and now you want me
to write a eulogy.

39:56.785 --> 39:59.832
No, I just don't want
to spend my last days

39:59.875 --> 40:02.269

the great Liz Ortecho

40:59.674 --> 41:01.589
wasn't worthy
