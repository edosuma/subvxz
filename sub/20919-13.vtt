WEBVTT

00:04.955 --> 00:06.822
We're home!

00:06.857 --> 00:10.633
Back on Earth.
Wonder what we missed.

00:10.669 --> 00:12.044
Dr. Foster.

00:12.079 --> 00:13.987
Thor. Come on.

00:14.022 --> 00:16.431
We don't have time to lose. Hmm.

00:16.467 --> 00:19.943
[chattering]

00:19.979 --> 00:22.254
Captain America, when you
and the other Avengers

00:22.289 --> 00:24.873
were abducted,
this was left behind.

00:24.908 --> 00:26.507
Perhaps you could put it
to good use.

00:26.543 --> 00:29.428
Thank you, Vision.
Now it feels like home.

00:29.463 --> 00:31.838
[Thor] Friends! Everyone's back.

00:31.873 --> 00:33.235
We're going to need
all the Avengers

00:33.259 --> 00:36.151
if we're going to have a chance
at dealing... with this.

00:36.186 --> 00:37.819
[wind howling]

00:41.183 --> 00:44.443
So... snow day?

00:44.478 --> 00:47.104
Nay. This is no ordinary storm.

00:47.139 --> 00:51.283
This enchantment
has the hallmark of one person:

00:51.318 --> 00:52.876
Loki.

00:52.911 --> 00:54.544
[Loki laughing]

00:56.000 --> 01:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:09.762 --> 01:12.662
How did Loki do all this?

01:12.698 --> 01:15.624
While you were gone,
Loki took over the world.

01:15.659 --> 01:18.485
To do this to Earth.

01:18.520 --> 01:21.405
I have been a fool to show my
brother Loki mercy in the past.

01:21.440 --> 01:22.823
Not this time.

01:26.228 --> 01:28.707
I wanted a chance to thank your team
for risking your lives to save us,

01:28.731 --> 01:30.480
but I guess it'll have to wait.
Indeed.

01:30.516 --> 01:32.299
We have work to do.

01:32.334 --> 01:34.567
[together] Avengers Assemble!

01:34.603 --> 01:36.503
[Avengers chuckle]

01:36.538 --> 01:38.305
[both chuckle]

01:38.340 --> 01:41.141
Captain America, if you please.

01:41.176 --> 01:43.677
Avengers, spread out.
Get into the city.

01:43.712 --> 01:45.729
See what you can find.
Help anyone you can.

01:45.764 --> 01:47.939
Exactly what I would have said.

01:47.975 --> 01:50.283
[Thor grunts]

01:50.318 --> 01:55.079
You and me, Ant-Man. I swear,
we did a really good job

01:55.115 --> 01:58.461
of taking care of things here on Earth while
you were gone, until this whole Loki mess.

01:58.485 --> 02:01.069
I'm going topside
for a bird's-eye view.

02:01.104 --> 02:02.824
See if I can get the lay of the land.
Captain Marvel, wait.

02:02.848 --> 02:04.873
Make sure you look out
for the...

02:04.908 --> 02:06.691
Look out for the what?

02:06.726 --> 02:09.151
Aah! [Grunts]

02:09.187 --> 02:11.204
Dragons!

02:16.137 --> 02:19.438
No one said there'd be dragons.
Not that I mind.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.339
[grunting]

02:25.571 --> 02:26.678
[grunts]

02:28.990 --> 02:32.734
Please, let me show you
how it's done.

02:32.769 --> 02:34.978
[yells] [roaring]

02:36.331 --> 02:39.516
[yells]

02:39.551 --> 02:42.369
[grunts]

02:42.446 --> 02:44.688
[grunts] It's still got
some fight left in it.

02:44.723 --> 02:46.356
[grunts, groans]

02:46.392 --> 02:50.276
Captain America... Right
behind you, Black Panther.

02:50.311 --> 02:51.453
[grunts]

02:54.049 --> 02:55.932
[grunting]

02:55.967 --> 02:57.167
[roaring]

03:02.866 --> 03:04.374
Naptime.

03:04.409 --> 03:07.485
[grunts]

03:07.521 --> 03:10.889
There are hundreds
of these things above the city.

03:10.924 --> 03:13.792
Yeah. And this is just
one of the babies.

03:13.827 --> 03:15.972
Loki's dragons are keeping
everyone trapped in New York.

03:15.996 --> 03:18.104
Before this guy tried
to take a bite out of me,

03:18.139 --> 03:20.081
I saw a group congregating
in Central Park.

03:20.117 --> 03:21.691
If it's Loki's army,
they're that way.

03:24.479 --> 03:26.446
[wind howling]

03:29.042 --> 03:31.551
We are approaching a compound.

03:31.586 --> 03:33.867
There is no obvious entrance in,
other than over the wall.

03:36.300 --> 03:39.092
Copy that. We're on the
opposite side from you.

03:39.127 --> 03:40.911
Over here we've got
a big, unguarded gate.

03:40.946 --> 03:43.830
Key word being "unguarded."

03:43.866 --> 03:47.692
Protected by Asgardian magic.
Loki's doing, no doubt.

03:47.728 --> 03:50.053
Is there a way to get through it?
I have a way.

03:51.456 --> 03:52.456
[yells]

04:10.317 --> 04:12.284
[Loki laughing]

04:13.928 --> 04:16.688
Took you so long to show up.

04:16.723 --> 04:18.680
You've missed out
on all the fun.

04:18.716 --> 04:21.510
Welcome back to Earth, Avengers.

04:21.545 --> 04:24.312
Do you like what I've done
to the place?

04:24.347 --> 04:27.749
So that's how you did this.
The Casket of Ancient Winters!

04:27.784 --> 04:31.753
Wait. Who do we have here?

04:31.788 --> 04:34.463
Dr. Jane Foster.

04:34.499 --> 04:37.366
How nice of you to come
pay tribute in person.

04:37.402 --> 04:40.195
You remember me... [grunts]

04:40.197 --> 04:43.865
A-ho-oh. You do have a way
with people, Dr. Foster.

04:43.901 --> 04:45.658
Hm. Hm.

04:45.694 --> 04:48.186
Give up, Loki.

04:48.222 --> 04:50.522
Your plan to control Earth
was doomed from the beginning.

04:50.557 --> 04:53.216
Oh, you're wrong, brother.

04:53.252 --> 04:56.127
For I was burdened
with glorious purpose.

04:56.162 --> 04:59.097
But that burden has been lifted.

04:59.132 --> 05:03.643
After my Cabal scattered your
Avengers and left Earth undefended,

05:03.678 --> 05:07.321
I was free to spread my wings
and take what I wanted.

05:07.357 --> 05:09.457
I've won.

05:09.493 --> 05:13.127
The Earth that you love so much
belongs to me.

05:13.162 --> 05:17.132
And if you so much as lift a
finger to try and take it back,

05:17.167 --> 05:20.118
I'll tear this
little world apart.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.853
[creatures growling]

05:25.100 --> 05:28.093
Loki, call off
your Frost Trolls.

05:28.128 --> 05:30.353
This conflict
is between you and me.

05:30.388 --> 05:33.047
Leave the humans out of it!

05:33.082 --> 05:35.642
[Loki] But you've already
brought the humans into it.

05:35.677 --> 05:39.187
So I can do what I want.
Like this!

05:39.222 --> 05:41.614
[Avengers cry out]
[laughs, grunts]

05:41.649 --> 05:43.950
[yells]

05:43.985 --> 05:46.928
Ah, the Avengers,

05:46.963 --> 05:50.081
constantly going
from one trap to the next.

05:50.117 --> 05:54.160
After all this time, Thor,
still so naive.

05:54.195 --> 05:57.038
Frost Trolls,
the Avengers still live.

05:57.073 --> 05:59.991
Let's remedy that, shall we?

06:00.026 --> 06:01.434
[growling]

06:05.740 --> 06:07.399
[growling]

06:09.911 --> 06:12.378
Leave Thor for last,

06:12.414 --> 06:14.330
but shatter the others
into oblivion.

06:14.366 --> 06:16.241
[straining]

06:22.766 --> 06:26.009
[yells]

06:26.044 --> 06:27.710
Back off! [Growls]

06:30.515 --> 06:32.031
[growls] [grunts]

06:32.067 --> 06:34.976
Ms. Marvel, Vision!

06:34.978 --> 06:38.079
Get the others out of the ice,
and make it snappy!

06:38.115 --> 06:40.557
Aye, aye, Captain!

06:42.001 --> 06:43.601
[roars]

06:45.213 --> 06:47.514
[grunts]

06:47.549 --> 06:50.274
[grunts, groans]

06:50.310 --> 06:53.303
Come here, ya ice cube! [Grunts]

06:53.338 --> 06:58.141
[grunts] And here I wanted
your demise to be dramatic.

06:58.176 --> 07:00.092
[sighs] Lesson learned.

07:00.128 --> 07:02.962
We'll simply make it painful.

07:02.997 --> 07:05.281
[growling] [grunts]

07:05.317 --> 07:08.100
Let me know when
the painful part comes in,

07:08.136 --> 07:10.962
because so far, this is fun.

07:10.997 --> 07:14.257
[Trolls grunt]

07:15.961 --> 07:17.227
Are you injured, Captain?

07:17.262 --> 07:20.155
Please! Not the first time
I've been put on ice.

07:20.190 --> 07:22.348
[growling]

07:25.946 --> 07:28.505
More trolls closing in
on both flanks!

07:28.540 --> 07:31.516
Sitch is getting too hot.
Retreat and regroup.

07:31.551 --> 07:35.086
[Captain American]
You heard her! Go!

07:35.122 --> 07:37.572
[chuckles]
You know where to find me.

07:43.955 --> 07:45.075
Come on, people! Let's move!

07:52.172 --> 07:57.108
Loki is my responsibility.
I cannot run.

07:57.143 --> 07:59.583
We're not running. We're regrouping.
We'll come back stronger.

08:02.049 --> 08:04.299
We're out. Where to now?

08:04.334 --> 08:08.828
I know just the place.
Follow me.

08:08.863 --> 08:11.463
I know it's small, but I usually
don't have this many guests over.

08:21.860 --> 08:24.343
[growls, barks]

08:24.379 --> 08:27.105
Whoa! Easy there, puppy.
I'm friendly.

08:27.140 --> 08:29.148
Sorry, Hawkeye.
My dog doesn't like strangers.

08:29.184 --> 08:30.725
[barks]

08:30.760 --> 08:32.961
[barking]

08:41.412 --> 08:45.631
[Ant-Man] Jane saves the world and still
has time to read this many books?

08:45.667 --> 08:47.347
Ooh, I've heard good things
about this one!

08:49.087 --> 08:51.421
Can everyone see?

08:51.456 --> 08:53.016
[Ms. Marvel, Hawkeye,
Black Panther] No.

08:57.295 --> 08:58.295
[sniffs]

09:00.181 --> 09:03.007
[grunts] Hey, what was that for?

09:03.042 --> 09:04.951
Mm, fine.

09:04.987 --> 09:08.304
Uhh... Everybody scoot over. Mm.

09:08.340 --> 09:10.573
I can't feel my leg. [Grunts]

09:10.608 --> 09:13.225
[groans, cries] Okay, I'm good.

09:13.261 --> 09:15.736
[Dr. Foster]
These are giant stone ships.

09:15.772 --> 09:17.450
Loki's positioned them at the north
and south ends of Manhattan.

09:17.474 --> 09:19.382
The World Breakers.

09:19.417 --> 09:23.061
They are one of the ways
that Loki can unleash Ragnarok.

09:23.096 --> 09:25.938
The end of the world!

09:25.974 --> 09:30.193
If anyone moves against him,
Loki only need wave his hand

09:30.228 --> 09:32.737
for them to set sail
and destroy the Earth.

09:32.772 --> 09:35.465
Loki was well prepared.

09:35.500 --> 09:37.367
Organizing the Cabal,
kidnapping the Avengers,

09:37.402 --> 09:41.662
biding his time for the
right moment to take Earth.

09:41.698 --> 09:44.941
His forces are entrenched now.
Removing them will not be easy.

09:44.976 --> 09:48.052
It won't be easy,
but we can do it.

09:48.087 --> 09:50.191
Once I modify the portal
technology that brought you home,

09:50.215 --> 09:54.400
I can counteract Loki's magic and send
his dragons and trolls back to Asgard.

09:54.435 --> 09:56.453
But as soon as Loki
sees it coming,

09:56.488 --> 09:58.337
he'll activate
the World Breakers.

09:58.373 --> 10:00.515
Then we don't give him a chance.

10:00.550 --> 10:03.042
Hit both ships
and Loki at the same time.

10:03.078 --> 10:05.444
Don't give him time to react.
Split into three groups.

10:05.480 --> 10:06.841
I'll take a group
to the north ship.

10:06.865 --> 10:10.249
Captain Marvel, you lead another
group to the south ship.

10:10.284 --> 10:12.602
Thor, your group's got Loki.
Aye.

10:12.637 --> 10:16.096
So be honest.
Which group got the easy job?

10:16.132 --> 10:18.933
All three tasks will be
equally impossible.

10:18.969 --> 10:21.444
Certain doom. Gotcha.
Appreciate the honesty.

10:32.106 --> 10:34.624
The World Breaker.

10:34.659 --> 10:36.976
We need to figure out
how to destroy it.

10:37.012 --> 10:38.895
Without raining debris down
on all of Manhattan.

10:38.930 --> 10:40.088
That too.

10:46.162 --> 10:49.222
Permission to come aboard?

10:49.257 --> 10:52.975
[growls, grunts]

10:53.011 --> 10:55.719
[grunting] [thudding]

10:55.755 --> 10:57.855
Dropped a Hulk on it
and it didn't even move.

10:57.890 --> 10:59.791
Destroying this thing
is gonna be hard.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.901
[growling]

11:04.305 --> 11:06.089
And it ain't getting any easier.

11:06.124 --> 11:08.174
[grunting]

11:08.209 --> 11:10.702
[growling continues]

11:12.363 --> 11:15.206
[grunts, yells]

11:15.242 --> 11:18.751
[cries out] [roars]

11:18.787 --> 11:21.337
[grunts] [screaming]

11:21.372 --> 11:23.706
Heads up, army.

11:23.741 --> 11:25.625
Our World Breaker's
loaded with...

11:25.660 --> 11:28.485
Trolls? Yep, we found 'em.

11:28.521 --> 11:31.280
Or they found us. [Grunts]

11:31.315 --> 11:33.474
[growling]

11:36.121 --> 11:37.121
[groans]

11:38.948 --> 11:41.874
[growling]

11:41.909 --> 11:43.735
[grunting]

11:45.705 --> 11:47.321
I do believe that
was the last one.

11:49.792 --> 11:51.584
More trolls?

11:51.619 --> 11:53.119
That would be too easy.

11:54.622 --> 11:57.707
[thunderous footsteps]

12:01.087 --> 12:04.055
Air force, you seeing
what we're seeing?

12:04.132 --> 12:07.425
If what you're seeing
is a Destroyer, then yeah.

12:07.460 --> 12:09.260
Everybody move!

12:12.657 --> 12:14.849
This is my fault.

12:14.884 --> 12:17.860
Loki should never have been
allowed to get this far.

12:17.895 --> 12:20.447
You are not to blame
for your brother.

12:20.523 --> 12:23.190
Loki is entirely responsible
for his own behavior.

12:23.225 --> 12:26.352
My compassion for Loki
has been misplaced.

12:26.388 --> 12:28.538
I've always tried
to see the good in him,

12:28.573 --> 12:31.974
but now I see that it
just makes me naive.

12:32.009 --> 12:34.619
But that's what
makes you different.

12:34.654 --> 12:36.720
If you didn't
show compassion for Loki,

12:36.756 --> 12:39.490
you wouldn't be Thor,
you'd be Loki.

12:39.525 --> 12:41.709
And one of those is enough.

12:45.240 --> 12:47.123
[Loki]
You've come to see me again.

12:47.158 --> 12:49.842
I knew you couldn't resist.

12:49.878 --> 12:51.811
Enough of this, brother.

12:51.846 --> 12:54.054
Your playtime is over.

12:54.090 --> 12:56.741
Release control of Earth. Now!

12:56.776 --> 12:58.968
[laughing]

12:59.003 --> 13:01.663
Oh, my playtime has just begun.

13:01.698 --> 13:03.231
And I see a new toy.

13:06.486 --> 13:08.260
[screaming]

13:08.295 --> 13:10.838
No! Loki, stop! Vision!

13:10.873 --> 13:14.292
[groaning]

13:14.327 --> 13:16.802
Your teammates
may be loyal to you, Thor.

13:16.838 --> 13:19.881
But Vision?
Vision is just a thing.

13:19.916 --> 13:22.116
And things can be controlled.

13:22.151 --> 13:23.918
[groans]

13:29.567 --> 13:32.969
Vision, dear, destroy them.

13:38.317 --> 13:39.150
[grunting]

13:39.185 --> 13:41.126
Vision, don't do this!

13:41.162 --> 13:42.687
[grunts]

13:42.722 --> 13:44.672
Aah!

13:44.708 --> 13:46.699
He can't hear you.

13:46.734 --> 13:48.776
Or, actually, he doesn't care.

13:50.054 --> 13:52.113
[grunts]

13:52.148 --> 13:53.998
Don't fight us.

13:54.033 --> 13:56.517
Fight Loki's control!

13:56.553 --> 13:58.469
[grunts]

13:58.504 --> 13:59.871
[panting]

14:01.141 --> 14:02.415
[grunts]

14:03.793 --> 14:04.992
[cries out]

14:05.027 --> 14:06.102
[grunts]

14:06.137 --> 14:07.236
[straining]

14:07.272 --> 14:09.772
[yells]

14:09.808 --> 14:12.283
Loki, this is a fight
you cannot win!

14:12.318 --> 14:14.785
Then I'll have others
win it for me.

14:14.821 --> 14:17.013
[laughing]

14:17.048 --> 14:18.931
[all laughing]

14:21.194 --> 14:24.470
[grunting]

14:24.506 --> 14:27.206
Nothing but air, just like
your claim to this world!

14:27.241 --> 14:30.175
[grunting]

14:30.211 --> 14:32.811
[laughs]

14:32.847 --> 14:35.423
That "air" seems to be
giving you some trouble.

14:35.458 --> 14:37.408
[grunting]

14:39.462 --> 14:42.013
Loki's got his mind,

14:42.048 --> 14:44.160
and Vision can't feel pain,
so hit him as hard as you can!

14:44.184 --> 14:45.791
[grunts]

14:48.445 --> 14:49.795
[yells]

14:51.265 --> 14:52.273
[grunts] [grunts]

14:52.308 --> 14:54.216
[grunting]

15:01.309 --> 15:03.976
Hit the Destroyer with everything
we've got! It's our only chance!

15:05.988 --> 15:07.897
[grunting]

15:13.287 --> 15:15.529
[grunting]

15:17.708 --> 15:20.142
[yells] [grunts]

15:20.178 --> 15:22.578
[chuckles]

15:25.216 --> 15:27.641
[rumbling]

15:27.677 --> 15:29.443
What was that? Were we hit?

15:29.479 --> 15:31.754
No. We've set sail.

15:40.306 --> 15:44.249
Loki has activated
the World Breakers.

15:44.285 --> 15:47.085
[Captain Marvel] Our ship's on the
move too. We're running out of time.

15:47.430 --> 15:50.839
[both grunting]

15:50.875 --> 15:52.733
[groans]

16:01.711 --> 16:03.163
[Dr. Foster] Captain
Marvel, Captain America.

16:03.187 --> 16:04.298
You need to get control
of the ships. Now.

16:04.322 --> 16:07.623
You can't let the two World
Breakers meet up over Manhattan.

16:07.659 --> 16:11.727
If they come together, they'll release an
energy pulse that will destroy the Earth.

16:11.763 --> 16:14.005
So keep the ships
away from each other.

16:14.040 --> 16:16.565
Try to get them over open ocean
and destroy them there

16:16.601 --> 16:18.901
so they don't crush
the entire tristate area.

16:18.937 --> 16:21.929
Understood. Any tips
for steering a flying ship

16:21.964 --> 16:24.723
powered by Asgardian magic?
Cap, heads up!

16:24.759 --> 16:27.585
Lucky for us,
we're not on Asgard.

16:27.620 --> 16:30.796
As long as we're on Earth,
basic laws of physics apply.

16:30.832 --> 16:33.051
If you can hack their flying
controls, you can fly the ship.

16:33.075 --> 16:35.017
Stone can be hacked?

16:35.052 --> 16:36.760
Physics.

16:36.795 --> 16:39.038
I'll hold off the Destroyer.

16:39.115 --> 16:42.024
Panther, find the ship's controls!
[grunting]

16:42.059 --> 16:43.759
I believe I have found it.

16:43.794 --> 16:46.078
[grunts] Got it.

16:48.507 --> 16:51.125
[grunting]

16:53.187 --> 16:55.054
So where are we parking
this thing?

16:55.090 --> 16:57.189
[straining]

16:57.224 --> 17:01.635
[grunting]

17:01.671 --> 17:06.365
Not only did your attack fail, but it gave
me time to launch the World Breakers.

17:06.400 --> 17:09.410
You've just assured the
destruction of all of Midgard.

17:09.444 --> 17:11.061
You should be proud.

17:15.542 --> 17:17.969
[grunts]

17:18.003 --> 17:20.221
Have you noticed Vision's
just holding us off?

17:20.256 --> 17:22.732
He's had chances to take us out.
Why hasn't he?

17:22.767 --> 17:24.950
Ant-Man, don't give him
any ideas.

17:29.140 --> 17:31.040
[grunts]

17:32.243 --> 17:33.243
Aah!

17:35.488 --> 17:37.880
There is still time, Loki.

17:37.915 --> 17:40.374
Your World Breakers will fail,
as will you!

17:40.409 --> 17:41.409
[yells]

17:45.240 --> 17:47.957
Yes. Now, Vision,

17:47.992 --> 17:50.534
use it to strike down
my brother!

17:50.570 --> 17:54.188
Strike him down
with all the fury of...

17:54.223 --> 17:57.191
Wait. How are you worthy enough
to lift that when I'm...

17:57.226 --> 17:59.618
controlling you?

17:59.654 --> 18:01.529
[shrieking]

18:02.848 --> 18:05.783
[groans]

18:07.586 --> 18:10.020
[laughing]

18:10.055 --> 18:12.289
Our deception worked,
friend Vision!

18:12.325 --> 18:15.017
You mean you and... and he were...

18:15.052 --> 18:19.146
That's why you didn't take
us out when you could have.

18:19.181 --> 18:21.661
I was merely acting. And I think
I've gotten rather good at it.

18:31.677 --> 18:34.570
We need to take this thing apart
where it can't do any damage.

18:34.605 --> 18:36.430
[grunts]
A little busy over here.

18:36.465 --> 18:37.465
[roars]

18:40.628 --> 18:41.628
[yells]

18:43.305 --> 18:44.989
That does give me an idea.

18:47.335 --> 18:48.984
Captain Marvel,
you know the Avengers'

18:49.019 --> 18:51.920
"face in the mud" maneuver?

18:51.955 --> 18:53.672
I think I know the one.

18:53.708 --> 18:56.108
Then hit it!

18:56.144 --> 18:58.169
[yells]

18:59.605 --> 19:00.729
[grunts]

19:00.764 --> 19:02.464
[straining]

19:05.403 --> 19:09.012
[yells]

19:09.048 --> 19:10.514
[Hawkeye] We did it!

19:12.009 --> 19:13.934
And I'm dead.

19:16.380 --> 19:17.660
[Captain Marvel]
Your turn, army.

19:19.625 --> 19:21.108
You heard her. Take 'em down!

19:37.994 --> 19:40.744
[wind howling]

19:40.780 --> 19:43.430
[Captain America] We did it.
World Breaker is down.

19:43.466 --> 19:45.706
[Captain Marvel] Here too.
You're good to go, Dr. Foster.

19:46.669 --> 19:48.219
I really need
a bigger apartment.

19:59.640 --> 20:01.440
Winter's been cancelled.

20:02.877 --> 20:05.444
[trolls shrieking]

20:20.494 --> 20:23.512
What is this?

20:23.547 --> 20:26.665
A truce,
if you will agree to it.

20:26.700 --> 20:28.767
We will always be brothers.

20:28.802 --> 20:31.428
Let us work together for peace.

20:36.410 --> 20:40.329
[chuckles] So, if I won't
go along with your plan,

20:40.365 --> 20:43.732
I suppose it's time
to send me back to Asgard.

20:43.768 --> 20:48.837
Oh, no, brother. Not this time.

20:48.873 --> 20:50.973
[Captain America]
It's good to be home.

20:51.008 --> 20:53.250
[Captain Marvel]
Even better to be together.

20:53.286 --> 20:55.347
Ah, but at least there's plenty
of room for all the Avengers.

20:55.371 --> 20:57.037
And guests.

21:03.588 --> 21:08.064
You will remain here, where we
can keep a close eye on you.

21:08.100 --> 21:11.785
Savor your victory, brother,

21:11.820 --> 21:14.722
because someday I will see
your Earth destroyed

21:14.757 --> 21:17.758
beyond repair.

21:17.793 --> 21:21.320
Earth is under
our protection, Loki,

21:21.355 --> 21:23.422
and it always will be.

21:23.457 --> 21:27.417
[laughing] This isn't over.

21:27.453 --> 21:30.579
It's only just begun.
Keep an eye out!

21:30.614 --> 21:38.614
Strange things are on the way.
[laughing]
