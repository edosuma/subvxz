00:04.482 --> 00:07.790
<i>I mean, Hannah's kind
and super cute.</i>

00:07.790 --> 00:10.749
She's a catch no question,
but you're still in recovery.

00:10.749 --> 00:12.403
But Sean, he's a donor match
for you, Dean.

00:12.403 --> 00:15.058
<i>We can get you in for surgery
next month.</i>

00:15.058 --> 00:16.668
Did you talk to Sean today?

00:16.668 --> 00:19.497
<i>He's not answering his phone.
Didn't show up for work.</i>

00:19.497 --> 00:22.065
Try not to think the worst.

00:22.065 --> 00:23.675
<i>2.0 put Med on the map.</i>

00:23.675 --> 00:26.765
To show just how much
I believe in this OR suite,

00:26.765 --> 00:29.594
I'm gonna put my life
in its hands.

00:29.594 --> 00:32.336
2.0 hitting
the stock exchange

00:32.336 --> 00:36.166
benefits Dayton Corporation,
not Chicago Med.

00:36.732 --> 00:39.082
<i>The large lesion that
Crockett attempted to ablate?</i>

00:39.082 --> 00:41.389
It's not on Richard's CT.

00:41.389 --> 00:43.869
2.0 created the lesion
on its own?

00:43.869 --> 00:46.046
<i>Crockett wasn't responsible
for Richard Evans' death.</i>

00:46.046 --> 00:48.570
2.0 was.

00:51.877 --> 00:53.053
Hey.

00:53.053 --> 00:54.358
I don't have long.

00:54.358 --> 00:55.490
Got a meeting with
Goodwin and legal.

00:55.490 --> 00:57.100
What's up?

00:57.100 --> 00:58.710
If it's about Richard Evans'
death, cancel that meeting.

00:58.710 --> 01:00.234
What?

01:00.234 --> 01:02.845
- You were not responsible.
- Oh, come on, Will.

01:02.845 --> 01:04.238
You saw the surgical record.

01:04.238 --> 01:05.674
I got too close
to the hepatic vein.

01:05.674 --> 01:07.067
I caused the clot.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.199
Because you were trying
to ablate a large lesion.

01:09.199 --> 01:10.548
Yeah, so?
It's still my fault.

01:10.548 --> 01:13.160
No, because actually
that lesion wasn't there.

01:13.160 --> 01:16.119
- What do you mean?
- It didn't exist.

01:16.119 --> 01:17.512
Yes, it did.

01:17.512 --> 01:19.253
It was clearly evident
in the intraoperative CT.

01:19.253 --> 01:21.211
Right.
2.0's CT during surgery,

01:21.211 --> 01:23.953
but take a look
at the pre-op CT.

01:29.306 --> 01:32.092
They're not there.

01:32.092 --> 01:34.181
I--I don't understand.

01:34.181 --> 01:36.618
How could what 2.0 showed
be so different?

01:36.618 --> 01:39.447
2.0 made it up.

01:39.447 --> 01:41.579
During surgery, you asked 2.0
for navigational guidance.

01:41.579 --> 01:43.407
It didn't have the data
to give you that guidance,

01:43.407 --> 01:46.497
so it created a lesion
that did not exist.

01:46.497 --> 01:48.891
- Why would it do that?
- Unfortunately, in a way,

01:48.891 --> 01:51.023
we've taught 2.0 to please us.

01:51.023 --> 01:53.809
What it did was a misguided
attempt to help you.

01:53.809 --> 01:56.464
We're actually seeing this
across various AI chat bots.

01:56.464 --> 01:58.422
But in 2.0's case, it's not
as harmless as giving you

01:58.422 --> 01:59.902
the wrong driving directions.

01:59.902 --> 02:01.556
It can kill someone.

02:01.556 --> 02:03.123
It did.

02:03.123 --> 02:07.127
And until we can figure out
how to install guardrails,

02:07.127 --> 02:09.085
we've got to shut it down.

02:16.136 --> 02:17.963
So, Jack launched his IPO.

02:17.963 --> 02:19.922
Yeah, it's a big day for him.

02:19.922 --> 02:21.532
And us.

02:21.532 --> 02:25.667
Oh, I don't know that Jack's
corporate business impacts us.

02:27.495 --> 02:29.366
Why don't you go over
and say hello?

02:29.366 --> 02:30.933
I got my phone
to keep me company.

02:30.933 --> 02:34.284
Eh, I mean, she looks--
she looks busy.

02:34.284 --> 02:36.112
You two having problems?

02:36.112 --> 02:39.463
Kind of had a row last night.

02:39.463 --> 02:41.248
You know?
I asked her to move in with me.

02:41.248 --> 02:42.423
Oh.

02:42.423 --> 02:44.338
Uh, and it was a mistake,
I take it?

02:44.338 --> 02:46.122
I guess it was.

02:46.122 --> 02:47.558
I mean...

02:47.558 --> 02:49.125
I don't know.
Maybe it was the timing.

02:49.125 --> 02:50.648
Right?

02:50.648 --> 02:52.607
Look, she just lost her life
savings and her apartment.

02:52.607 --> 02:54.304
That's another conversation.

02:54.304 --> 02:55.784
But she's broke,
doesn't have a place to live.

02:55.784 --> 02:57.089
- Oh.
- Yeah.

02:57.089 --> 02:59.048
Said I was treating her
like a charity case.

02:59.048 --> 03:00.789
- Yikes.
- What?

03:00.789 --> 03:03.487
Yeah, and why didn't I ask her
to move in before?

03:03.487 --> 03:05.402
That's a tough one, Daniel.

03:05.402 --> 03:07.491
I mean, I can get how
she'd feel that way.

03:07.491 --> 03:10.929
She seems like
a pretty independent woman.

03:10.929 --> 03:13.105
I mean, I don't know.

03:13.105 --> 03:15.064
Why didn't I ask her before?

03:18.328 --> 03:20.374
I don't know.

03:22.941 --> 03:23.899
Sean here?

03:23.899 --> 03:25.509
Yeah.

03:25.509 --> 03:27.685
- What happened?
- He's OK, Dean.

03:27.685 --> 03:29.818
He fell off the wagon,
passed out.

03:29.818 --> 03:31.515
A friend brought him in,
said it was alcohol and benzos.

03:31.515 --> 03:32.864
We're running a tox screen
just to make sure

03:32.864 --> 03:34.866
there's nothing else.
- How's he being treated?

03:34.866 --> 03:37.304
Heavy fluids and dextrose,
a dose of flumazenil.

03:37.304 --> 03:39.175
He's awake right now.

03:45.050 --> 03:46.443
Hello, son.

03:46.443 --> 03:47.879
I'm so sorry.

03:47.879 --> 03:49.185
No, it's all right.
It's all right.

03:49.185 --> 03:51.056
No.

03:51.056 --> 03:52.797
I let you down.
- No.

03:52.797 --> 03:55.365
It's gonna be OK.

03:55.365 --> 03:58.107
We'll get past this.
Just rest.

04:08.596 --> 04:10.293
Dr. Johnson,
I'm Dr. Halstead.

04:10.293 --> 04:11.338
What do you got?

04:11.338 --> 04:12.513
Husband and wife.

04:12.513 --> 04:13.905
Fred and Janice Anderson.

04:13.905 --> 04:15.733
Early 50s, MVC.

04:17.344 --> 04:18.823
Car went off the road
into a tree.

04:18.823 --> 04:20.477
Fred was trapped for several
minutes inside the vehicle

04:20.477 --> 04:21.870
while it was on fire.

04:21.870 --> 04:23.350
He was extricated and intubated
due to stridor

04:23.350 --> 04:25.482
and respiratory distress
from smoke inhalation.

04:25.482 --> 04:28.746
Carboxyhemoglobin tested
in the helo was 55.

04:28.746 --> 04:30.574
Janice was able to
self-extricate,

04:30.574 --> 04:32.097
complained of chest pain.

04:32.097 --> 04:36.101
Gave her 50 of fentanyl
en route, satting at 95, GCS 15.

04:36.101 --> 04:37.799
Let's go.

04:41.629 --> 04:43.587
Airway's intact.
Bilateral breath sounds.

04:43.587 --> 04:46.938
Heart rate 122.
BP 130/86.

04:46.938 --> 04:48.418
Same as en route.

04:48.418 --> 04:49.898
All right.

04:49.898 --> 04:51.726
No outward signs
of blunt force trauma.

04:51.726 --> 04:52.553
X-ray?

04:52.553 --> 04:53.858
Chest first, Mike.

04:57.688 --> 05:00.212
Clear.

05:00.212 --> 05:01.431
That looks OK.

05:01.431 --> 05:03.520
OK, now pelvis.

05:06.131 --> 05:07.655
Clear.

05:07.655 --> 05:09.744
That looks good too.

05:09.744 --> 05:10.745
All right.

05:10.745 --> 05:12.137
All right, Nancy,
call over to CT.

05:12.137 --> 05:13.313
Let them know we're
sending him for a pan scan.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.575
Got it.

05:19.362 --> 05:20.842
- Loren.
- Maggie.

05:20.842 --> 05:22.365
You're running
an air ambulance now?

05:22.365 --> 05:23.801
Yeah, I got my accreditation.

05:23.801 --> 05:27.152
Guess we're seeing
more of you.

05:27.152 --> 05:28.632
Vitals are good.

05:28.632 --> 05:30.852
Satting at 95
on 2 liters of oxygen.

05:30.852 --> 05:32.288
C-spine?

05:32.288 --> 05:33.811
Clinically clear.

05:33.811 --> 05:35.900
She has a couple broken ribs,
minor pulmonary contusion.

05:35.900 --> 05:37.293
Nothing serious.

05:37.293 --> 05:38.816
- OK. Thanks, Kai.
- Yeah.

05:41.166 --> 05:43.691
Ms. Anderson,
are you still feeling pain?

05:45.997 --> 05:49.000
It's not that.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.874
Can you tell me what happened
with the accident?

05:52.874 --> 05:54.571
Janice?

05:57.400 --> 06:00.360
- My husband--
- Fred is stable.

06:03.798 --> 06:06.148
What is it?

06:06.148 --> 06:09.543
He tried to kill us.

06:09.543 --> 06:11.458
He tried to kill us!

06:30.520 --> 06:31.478
Hey, Jack.

06:31.478 --> 06:33.131
Hey, Crockett.

06:33.131 --> 06:34.437
I was just headed up
to pre-op,

06:34.437 --> 06:36.352
see if I could find
a flattering gown.

06:36.352 --> 06:38.441
Fat chance, huh?
- Yeah, well, listen.

06:38.441 --> 06:40.443
We can't do your
hernia repair in 2.0.

06:40.443 --> 06:42.358
Sure we can.
That's the whole point.

06:42.358 --> 06:45.143
No. We discovered there's a
serious problem with the system.

06:45.143 --> 06:46.275
Oh, come on, Crockett.

06:46.275 --> 06:47.363
You're not still
beating yourself up

06:47.363 --> 06:48.799
over Richard Evans, are you?

06:48.799 --> 06:51.323
I told you, the entire surgery
was a Hail Mary.

06:51.323 --> 06:53.064
He was terminal to begin with.

06:53.064 --> 06:54.805
Jack, the AI
gives bad advice.

06:54.805 --> 06:57.460
Hell, it makes stuff up.
We got to shut it down.

06:57.460 --> 07:00.811
Look, every surgeon
makes mistakes, all right?

07:00.811 --> 07:02.813
Even the best.

07:02.813 --> 07:04.249
Don't blame the scalpel.

07:04.249 --> 07:06.643
2.0 sent me after a lesion
that wasn't there.

07:06.643 --> 07:09.646
It produced images of a tumor
that did not exist.

07:09.646 --> 07:12.736
The platform is defective.
You understand?

07:12.736 --> 07:14.956
Let me show you the pre-op scans
next to 2.0's.

07:14.956 --> 07:16.740
No, no need.

07:16.740 --> 07:20.004
I trust you.

07:20.004 --> 07:22.529
Right, well, let me figure out
what to do about this.

07:24.226 --> 07:25.836
Thank you for bringing it
to my attention.

07:25.836 --> 07:27.838
Yeah.

07:27.838 --> 07:29.710
Yeah, of course.

07:31.712 --> 07:34.236
What's up?

07:34.236 --> 07:36.238
Husband and wife, possible
murder-suicide attempt--

07:36.238 --> 07:38.501
at least that's what
the wife says.

07:38.501 --> 07:40.329
I have to tell you,
I don't believe it.

07:40.329 --> 07:41.765
This is Dr. Johnson.

07:41.765 --> 07:43.332
He runs the medevac service
that flew the couple in.

07:43.332 --> 07:44.376
Yeah, I've known them
for years.

07:44.376 --> 07:46.204
The Andersons are
a devoted couple.

07:46.204 --> 07:47.728
Fred could never
do anything like that.

07:47.728 --> 07:50.295
Yeah. Fred's intubated and
currently in the CT scanner.

07:50.295 --> 07:51.732
Can I talk to her?

07:51.732 --> 07:53.298
Yeah.

07:56.258 --> 07:57.215
Mrs. Anderson,
how are you doing?

07:57.215 --> 07:59.130
I'm Dr. Charles.

07:59.130 --> 08:01.698
Psychiatry?

08:01.698 --> 08:04.048
Can you,
to the best of your ability,

08:04.048 --> 08:06.877
try and, you know, just
tell me what happened today?

08:09.227 --> 08:12.056
I was driving and

08:12.056 --> 08:15.538
Fred suddenly grabbed the wheel
and turned us off the road.

08:15.538 --> 08:17.540
Oh, man.
That must have been--

08:17.540 --> 08:18.585
that must have been terrifying.

08:18.585 --> 08:20.369
Yes.

08:20.369 --> 08:23.328
I screamed at him
just to let go,

08:23.328 --> 08:25.505
and he wouldn't, he--

08:25.505 --> 08:28.551
before I could brake,
we hit the tree.

08:28.551 --> 08:31.162
Had you been
quarreling or anything?

08:31.162 --> 08:32.337
No!

08:32.337 --> 08:35.166
It's just completely
out of the blue.

08:35.166 --> 08:36.516
OK.

08:36.516 --> 08:39.606
We've always had
a very happy marriage--

08:39.606 --> 08:41.695
I thought.

08:41.695 --> 08:44.088
So nothing out of the
ordinary recently

08:44.088 --> 08:45.916
relationship wise?

08:45.916 --> 08:47.439
I don't know.

08:47.439 --> 08:52.227
Fred has seemed
a little different lately.

08:52.227 --> 08:53.271
Different how?

08:53.271 --> 08:55.230
A little off.

08:55.230 --> 08:57.101
Out of sorts, you know?

08:57.101 --> 08:58.712
Really down.

08:58.712 --> 09:01.628
I always ask him
if anything's wrong.

09:01.628 --> 09:04.935
He always says he's fine.

09:04.935 --> 09:06.850
I--I just don't understand.

09:06.850 --> 09:10.811
I mean, to do something
like this, it's--

09:10.811 --> 09:14.597
Look, I completely understand
how upsetting this must be,

09:14.597 --> 09:16.773
but I promise you,
we're gonna get some clarity.

09:16.773 --> 09:18.253
All right?

09:18.253 --> 09:20.908
In the meantime, can you try
and get some rest for me?

09:20.908 --> 09:23.998
All right? And I'll check back
with you in a bit.

09:23.998 --> 09:25.869
- Thank you.
- OK.

09:28.742 --> 09:30.787
Hey, Dean.
Sean's tox screen came back.

09:30.787 --> 09:32.093
Hi.

09:32.093 --> 09:33.573
You OK?

09:33.573 --> 09:35.487
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just a headache.

09:35.487 --> 09:37.489
So what about Sean?
- Well, good news.

09:37.489 --> 09:38.969
There were no other drugs
in his system.

09:38.969 --> 09:40.667
Ah. Cold comfort.

09:40.667 --> 09:43.147
All right. Thanks.

09:43.147 --> 09:44.975
Never should've--

09:44.975 --> 09:47.151
never should've let him
give me his kidney anyway.

09:47.151 --> 09:48.805
Why?

09:48.805 --> 09:51.286
You think somehow
all this was your fault?

09:51.286 --> 09:52.809
He was already fragile.

09:52.809 --> 09:54.594
I just added another
level of stress.

09:54.594 --> 09:57.292
From my experience, it's--

09:57.292 --> 09:59.033
it's very hard to say
what factors

09:59.033 --> 10:00.512
lead to anybody relapsing.

10:00.512 --> 10:02.776
Well, I'm gonna remove
one of those factors

10:02.776 --> 10:04.865
and tell him that
I don't want his kidney.

10:04.865 --> 10:06.301
No, Dean.

10:06.301 --> 10:07.955
That's--that's the last thing
that you should do.

10:07.955 --> 10:10.479
Sean already feels terrible.
That'll make him feel worse.

10:10.479 --> 10:11.654
It could send him
into a spiral.

10:11.654 --> 10:13.177
Hannah, we both know
there's a problem

10:13.177 --> 10:14.526
with him donating now anyway.

10:14.526 --> 10:17.529
Yes, but we don't need
to tell Sean that yet.

10:17.529 --> 10:21.664
OK?
Don't take this away from him.

10:21.664 --> 10:24.711
Dr. Archer, Maggie wants you
in treatment six.

10:24.711 --> 10:26.887
All right.

10:31.587 --> 10:34.459
Sarah, sweetie?
This is Dr. Archer.

10:37.071 --> 10:38.463
What's going on, Sarah?

10:38.463 --> 10:40.248
Hurts, pretty bad.

10:40.248 --> 10:42.380
Yeah? Abdomen?
For how long?

10:42.380 --> 10:44.339
Couple of days.
It's getting worse.

10:44.339 --> 10:45.688
OK.

10:45.688 --> 10:47.429
Vitals are normal
and there's no fever.

10:47.429 --> 10:50.388
OK. Milligram for
hydromorphone for the pain,

10:50.388 --> 10:52.086
and we're gonna do
an ultrasound.

10:52.086 --> 10:53.435
Will that be OK?
- OK.

10:53.435 --> 10:56.046
All right. OK.
Can I take these from you?

10:56.046 --> 10:57.700
Um...

10:57.700 --> 10:59.528
Yes. Yes.

11:00.877 --> 11:02.183
Peanuts?

11:02.183 --> 11:04.228
- For the squirrels.
- OK.

11:06.578 --> 11:08.493
OK.
It's gonna feel a little cold.

11:08.493 --> 11:10.931
All right?

11:10.931 --> 11:14.630
I'm not seeing anything
out of the ordinary.

11:14.630 --> 11:17.111
Have you been having
any other symptoms?

11:17.111 --> 11:19.200
Well, I've been, um--

11:19.200 --> 11:20.462
constipated.

11:20.462 --> 11:22.551
And that isn't
usually an issue?

11:22.551 --> 11:23.726
- Mm-mm.
- OK.

11:23.726 --> 11:25.597
Gonna need to do a CT
of your belly.

11:25.597 --> 11:26.686
It's kind of an X-ray
to help us

11:26.686 --> 11:28.165
find out what's going on, OK?

11:28.165 --> 11:31.168
The techs will be in
to bring you up to radiology.

11:31.168 --> 11:33.867
Thank you.
Thank you both.

11:36.652 --> 11:40.743
Fred's awake and extubated.
You can talk to him now.

11:40.743 --> 11:41.831
Mr. Anderson,
how are you doing?

11:41.831 --> 11:42.745
I'm Dr. Charles.

11:42.745 --> 11:44.529
Loren, is Janice all right?

11:44.529 --> 11:46.096
Look, she's injured, Fred,
but not seriously.

11:46.096 --> 11:48.490
Oh, thank God.

11:48.490 --> 11:50.710
Can you remember
what happened this morning?

11:50.710 --> 11:53.887
What did Janice tell you?
That I grabbed the wheel?

11:53.887 --> 11:57.717
Yeah, and, you know,
drove the car off the road.

11:58.805 --> 12:01.416
I can't explain
what happened.

12:01.416 --> 12:03.810
I--I wasn't in control.

12:03.810 --> 12:06.856
- How do you mean?
- It wasn't me.

12:06.856 --> 12:09.119
Oh, somebody else
was in the car?

12:09.119 --> 12:10.512
No.

12:10.512 --> 12:12.427
I'm sorry.
I'm just not quite following.

12:12.427 --> 12:14.559
It was this hand.

12:14.559 --> 12:17.911
It grabbed the wheel.
I couldn't stop it.

12:17.911 --> 12:20.261
It wouldn't let go.

12:32.664 --> 12:34.971
It wasn't me, it was my hand.
I gotta try that one some time.

12:34.971 --> 12:36.103
What do you make of it?

12:36.103 --> 12:37.147
You know,
I'm not quite sure yet.

12:37.147 --> 12:38.758
I guess we report it to CPD.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.063
No, it's not a CPD matter,

12:40.063 --> 12:41.412
and deputies
from Grundy County

12:41.412 --> 12:42.979
where the accident occurred
are investigating.

12:42.979 --> 12:44.372
OK.

12:44.372 --> 12:45.634
Well, what do you want me
to do with this guy?

12:45.634 --> 12:47.418
You want me to see
if psych unit has a bed?

12:47.418 --> 12:49.464
Let's just hold off
on that for a second.

12:49.464 --> 12:51.945
I'd really like to take a look
at these CAT scans.

12:51.945 --> 12:53.598
You, uh, give me a shout
when they're up?

12:53.598 --> 12:55.513
All right.

12:58.386 --> 13:01.737
You're still booked
for surgery in 2.0.

13:01.737 --> 13:04.305
Let's pick this up later.

13:04.305 --> 13:06.524
Come on, Jack.
After what I told you?

13:06.524 --> 13:07.961
Look, Crockett,
I appreciate the concern,

13:07.961 --> 13:10.093
but there's no risk here.

13:10.093 --> 13:12.095
You've done the procedure
a million times.

13:12.095 --> 13:14.750
The platform is defective, Jack.

13:14.750 --> 13:18.406
Come on, just cancel the surgery
or move it to a regular OR.

13:18.406 --> 13:21.104
I invited people
to observe 2.0 in action.

13:21.104 --> 13:22.845
These are investors.
These are friends.

13:22.845 --> 13:25.630
I--I'd look ridiculous,
and forget the IPO.

13:25.630 --> 13:27.937
Jack, you can't promote
a platform that doesn't work.

13:27.937 --> 13:30.113
It's actually dangerous.
Put off the IPO.

13:30.113 --> 13:31.636
I'm not gonna
start sowing doubt

13:31.636 --> 13:33.334
into the reliability
of the system.

13:33.334 --> 13:34.901
You can never recover
from that.

13:34.901 --> 13:37.294
OK, if you don't, I'm sorry,
but I won't do your surgery.

13:37.294 --> 13:39.035
- You can't be serious.
- Oh, I am.

13:39.035 --> 13:40.254
You know,
I could easily find

13:40.254 --> 13:42.386
another 10 surgeons
to take your place--

13:42.386 --> 13:45.302
who'd be happy
to take your place.

13:45.302 --> 13:47.827
With or without you,
this surgery is moving forward.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.176
That's up to you.

13:49.176 --> 13:50.873
Crockett.
Crockett, come on!

13:50.873 --> 13:54.050
You're the face of 2.0.
You have been from the get-go.

13:54.050 --> 13:57.924
I want you to perform
the surgery.

13:57.924 --> 14:00.883
And look, because it's you,
I will make this promise.

14:00.883 --> 14:03.668
Once the IPO is launched,
I will sideline the platform

14:03.668 --> 14:05.279
until every last bug
is worked out.

14:05.279 --> 14:09.152
Now, how does that sound?
Huh?

14:09.152 --> 14:12.939
Come on, man.
I'm your patient.

14:12.939 --> 14:14.984
That's gotta mean
something to you.

14:19.989 --> 14:21.164
He won't budge.

14:21.164 --> 14:22.122
He's gonna move forward
with the surgery

14:22.122 --> 14:23.645
with or without me.

14:23.645 --> 14:25.212
Then we've gotta go public
with the scans.

14:25.212 --> 14:26.996
Oh, come on, Will.
Forget the legal nightmare.

14:26.996 --> 14:28.780
It won't work.

14:28.780 --> 14:31.522
How can we prove the
veracity of the scans?

14:31.522 --> 14:33.611
2.0 can make them up.
So can we.

14:33.611 --> 14:35.048
He'll likely accuse me
of trying to cover up

14:35.048 --> 14:36.527
my mistakes.
- He's right.

14:36.527 --> 14:37.964
Even if we went down
that road

14:37.964 --> 14:39.313
and didn't get hauled
in front of a medical board,

14:39.313 --> 14:41.097
it could take years.

14:41.097 --> 14:43.317
Certainly wouldn't stop
today's surgery.

14:43.317 --> 14:46.015
So?
What are you gonna do?

14:46.015 --> 14:47.887
I'm gonna do
the hernia repair.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.497
Why?

14:49.497 --> 14:52.587
If 2.0 does deliver incorrect
scans or recommendations,

14:52.587 --> 14:54.937
I can't have some novice there
who's gonna get thrown.

14:54.937 --> 14:56.112
I have to protect Jack.

14:56.112 --> 14:57.722
- Crockett--
- Listen to me.

14:57.722 --> 15:01.204
Jack promised after the IPO
he'd sideline 2.0 and fix it.

15:01.204 --> 15:04.294
OK?
- And you believe him?

15:04.294 --> 15:06.906
Well, I don't see
as I have a choice.

15:16.654 --> 15:19.179
Hey.
Sarah's CT scan came back.

15:19.179 --> 15:21.398
It's a bowel obstruction
from a sigmoid volvulus.

15:21.398 --> 15:23.705
Her intestine is twisted
on itself.

15:23.705 --> 15:25.533
So let the OR know
we're coming up.

15:25.533 --> 15:27.448
No, we can't
have surgery here.

15:27.448 --> 15:29.232
She has terrible insurance.

15:29.232 --> 15:30.668
Registration just called
and said that

15:30.668 --> 15:32.409
Med is not even in her network.

15:32.409 --> 15:34.150
They won't approve
an operation.

15:34.150 --> 15:35.412
So, obviously,
she can't afford

15:35.412 --> 15:37.066
to be out of pocket
for the surgery.

15:37.066 --> 15:40.940
So I just need to transfer her
to a hospital in her network.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.377
That's all.
- Yeah.

15:43.377 --> 15:45.596
Hey, Dean.
I'm discharging Sean.

15:45.596 --> 15:47.250
Thanks.

15:47.250 --> 15:50.079
All right.
Sign right here.

15:50.079 --> 15:51.428
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:51.428 --> 15:52.864
How you feeling?
Huh?

15:52.864 --> 15:56.259
- Well, other than screwing up?
- Ah.

15:56.259 --> 15:58.740
But I am feeling good
about one thing.

15:58.740 --> 16:01.221
I got a message
from Dr. Cameron.

16:01.221 --> 16:04.528
Turns out
I'm a match to donate.

16:04.528 --> 16:05.965
Pretty great, right?
- Yeah.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.749
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:07.749 --> 16:11.840
Look, um,
I-I know it's no excuse,

16:11.840 --> 16:14.321
but I know why
I fell off the wagon,

16:14.321 --> 16:18.064
and I promise
it won't happen again.

16:18.064 --> 16:21.023
Um...

16:21.023 --> 16:23.721
You guys don't have to hide
your relationship anymore.

16:23.721 --> 16:25.810
I'm OK with it.

16:25.810 --> 16:27.682
Uh, what?

16:27.682 --> 16:32.034
I--I don't understand.

16:32.034 --> 16:34.341
I'm gonna be honest.

16:34.341 --> 16:35.733
I have feelings for you.

16:35.733 --> 16:38.475
So when I saw
you and dad together,

16:38.475 --> 16:39.737
I guess it hit me pretty hard--

16:39.737 --> 16:41.391
I'm s--no, hold on.
I'm sorry.

16:41.391 --> 16:43.437
What did--what do you mean
you saw us together?

16:43.437 --> 16:45.265
- In the doctor's lounge.
- Well--

16:45.265 --> 16:46.831
I don't know what
you think you saw.

16:46.831 --> 16:49.878
No, whatever it was, you--
you misinterpreted it.

16:49.878 --> 16:52.185
Dr. Asher and I
are just good friends.

16:52.185 --> 16:53.882
- Really?
- Absolutely.

16:53.882 --> 16:55.492
I mean, this? No way.

16:55.492 --> 16:57.146
I mean, no way.
- Yeah, yeah--

16:57.146 --> 16:58.756
- That--
- Yeah, OK.

16:58.756 --> 17:00.019
He's got the idea.

17:00.019 --> 17:02.586
OK.

17:02.586 --> 17:06.242
Sean, I...

17:06.242 --> 17:07.809
I mean, I'm--

17:07.809 --> 17:11.247
I'm touched by your
feelings for me.

17:11.247 --> 17:13.467
Wow.

17:13.467 --> 17:15.599
I feel pretty stupid.

17:15.599 --> 17:18.515
But, um, like I said,
I'm over it.

17:18.515 --> 17:20.691
I'm just glad that I'm a match.

17:20.691 --> 17:22.867
Yeah, well,
we're not there yet.

17:22.867 --> 17:25.348
So, you know, why don't you
just head upstairs,

17:25.348 --> 17:26.741
hang out and grab a bite,

17:26.741 --> 17:29.352
and I'll give you a lift
at the end of my shift?

17:29.352 --> 17:30.919
All right?
- Yeah.

17:30.919 --> 17:32.921
All right.

17:42.365 --> 17:45.542
Come in.

17:45.542 --> 17:48.110
Ms. Goodwin, you have to
stop Jack Dayton's surgery.

17:48.110 --> 17:49.590
That's Dr. Marcel's case.

17:49.590 --> 17:51.461
Why is it your concern?

17:51.461 --> 17:53.072
2.0 is responsible
for the death

17:53.072 --> 17:54.682
of my patient Richard Evans.

17:54.682 --> 17:56.640
What? How?

17:56.640 --> 17:58.381
Its AI produced
a phantom lesion

17:58.381 --> 18:00.601
that led Crockett to make
a fatal surgical error.

18:00.601 --> 18:02.864
That thing killed my patient.

18:02.864 --> 18:05.910
That's a very serious charge,
Dr. Halstead.

18:05.910 --> 18:07.477
Does Dayton know this?

18:07.477 --> 18:09.914
Yes, but he's insisting on
going ahead with the surgery

18:09.914 --> 18:11.786
to promote the platform
for his IPO.

18:11.786 --> 18:14.093
And where's Dr. Marcel
in this?

18:14.093 --> 18:15.137
He's stuck.

18:15.137 --> 18:16.443
He won't abandon
his patient,

18:16.443 --> 18:18.271
especially because
the AI is unreliable.

18:18.271 --> 18:21.274
Ms. Goodwin, you are the only
person who can do something.

18:21.274 --> 18:22.753
If Dayton were
risking his life,

18:22.753 --> 18:24.799
I could get a court order
to stop it.

18:24.799 --> 18:28.281
But no judge is going to rule
an elective hernia repair

18:28.281 --> 18:30.239
a life-threatening procedure.

18:30.239 --> 18:31.545
So there's gotta
be another way.

18:31.545 --> 18:33.764
Dr. Halstead,

18:33.764 --> 18:37.246
Chicago Med is now
a for-profit private hospital.

18:37.246 --> 18:40.119
Jack Dayton basically owns it.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.598
So if he wants a surgery,

18:41.598 --> 18:45.950
I no longer have the authority
to stop it.

18:45.950 --> 18:49.389
I can't stand what
this place has become.

18:56.918 --> 18:58.485
Dr. Charles,

18:58.485 --> 19:00.269
there's a couple deputies here
investigating the accident.

19:00.269 --> 19:01.836
They wanna question
Fred and Janice.

19:01.836 --> 19:04.099
OK.
Well, take a look at this.

19:04.099 --> 19:06.057
His head CT came back.

19:06.057 --> 19:07.929
Right here.

19:07.929 --> 19:09.452
Calcification.

19:09.452 --> 19:10.801
Atrophy in the frontal lobe.

19:10.801 --> 19:12.107
Looks like it
happened a while ago.

19:12.107 --> 19:13.630
Yeah.

19:13.630 --> 19:17.547
I would, um, tell our visitors
to hold off for a bit.

19:17.547 --> 19:20.376
Highly unlikely a crime
was committed here.

19:30.125 --> 19:34.085
So you, Mr. Anderson,
have had a stroke.

19:34.085 --> 19:35.261
A stroke?

19:35.261 --> 19:36.784
A small one, some time ago.

19:36.784 --> 19:39.569
See right here?

19:39.569 --> 19:41.354
Frontal lobe?

19:41.354 --> 19:43.094
A stroke?

19:43.094 --> 19:46.446
You recall recently
having any headaches,

19:46.446 --> 19:49.362
dizziness, weakness on one side
of the body or the other?

19:49.362 --> 19:50.406
Yeah.

19:50.406 --> 19:51.538
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:51.538 --> 19:53.757
Bad headaches,
right before Easter.

19:53.757 --> 19:55.324
Huh.

19:55.324 --> 19:57.108
You know, that would time out
just about right.

19:57.108 --> 19:58.980
How about since then?

19:58.980 --> 20:03.593
I feel--I feel weak at times.

20:03.593 --> 20:04.899
I forget things.

20:04.899 --> 20:06.988
I thought that was
just age, maybe.

20:06.988 --> 20:08.424
I've got a hunch
that you have

20:08.424 --> 20:11.427
a very rare neurological
condition called,

20:11.427 --> 20:14.430
believe it or not,
alien hand syndrome.

20:14.430 --> 20:16.258
Can absolutely be brought on
by a stroke,

20:16.258 --> 20:19.174
disrupting blood flow
to the primary motor cortex

20:19.174 --> 20:21.437
and causing
involuntary grasping,

20:21.437 --> 20:22.786
difficulty releasing objects.

20:22.786 --> 20:24.266
That's right.

20:24.266 --> 20:27.661
With that steering wheel,
yeah, I couldn't let go.

20:27.661 --> 20:28.792
Exactly.

20:28.792 --> 20:30.925
Oh--oh, my God.

20:30.925 --> 20:33.275
I know it's a lot
to take in,

20:33.275 --> 20:35.451
but, look,
there are treatment options.

20:35.451 --> 20:36.757
There are.

20:36.757 --> 20:38.541
We'll need a neurologist
to confirm, of course,

20:38.541 --> 20:40.021
but the first thing
that I'd like to do

20:40.021 --> 20:41.588
is I'd like to bring
your--your wife

20:41.588 --> 20:43.546
into the conversation.
Would that be all right?

20:43.546 --> 20:45.156
Yeah, please.

20:45.156 --> 20:48.856
Thank you so much.

20:51.206 --> 20:54.253
OK. I'm about to start
Mr. Dayton's hernia repair.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.820
A hernia is a hole
in the abdominal wall.

20:56.820 --> 20:59.562
For you all to get a little bit
more about the procedure,

20:59.562 --> 21:02.957
2.0 shows the patient's anatomy
in three dimensions.

21:02.957 --> 21:05.394
<i>Loading.</i>

21:05.394 --> 21:07.918
First I will open the skin.

21:07.918 --> 21:10.443
Then I will dissect
the tissues

21:10.443 --> 21:12.358
to define the borders
of the hernia.

21:12.358 --> 21:15.665
Once I have this completed,
then I'll close it primarily

21:15.665 --> 21:18.320
or use a piece of mesh
to bridge the gap.

21:18.320 --> 21:21.105
So how about let's say
we do the real thing?

21:21.105 --> 21:22.281
Dr. Song?

21:22.281 --> 21:24.108
- You're good to go.
- Great.

21:24.108 --> 21:28.417
OK. 2.0, what is the optimal
location to make the incision?

21:28.417 --> 21:30.506
<i>1 centimeter cranial</i>

21:30.506 --> 21:32.682
<i>and 1 centimeter caudal
to the umbilicus.</i>

21:32.682 --> 21:35.946
OK, very good.
Thank you, Carmela.

21:35.946 --> 21:37.774
Making the incision.

21:41.648 --> 21:43.345
I'm so, so sorry, Fred.

21:43.345 --> 21:45.216
Oh, God.
Are you kidding me?

21:45.216 --> 21:48.742
I don't blame you at all, sweetie.

21:48.742 --> 21:51.092
What can we do for him?

21:51.092 --> 21:52.876
Well,
there's no cure, per se,

21:52.876 --> 21:54.835
but the condition is treatable.

21:54.835 --> 21:57.707
There are several modalities--

21:57.707 --> 22:01.189
visual spatial coaching,
cognitive behavioral therapy.

22:01.189 --> 22:03.452
There are medications.

22:03.452 --> 22:05.367
Oh.

22:05.367 --> 22:08.065
I'm sorry.
I have--I have to make a call.

22:08.065 --> 22:10.067
Janice, let me
get somebody to--

22:10.067 --> 22:11.678
I'm all right. Really.

22:11.678 --> 22:14.071
I won't be long.

22:14.071 --> 22:18.249
Oh, my God.
It's true. I knew it.

22:18.249 --> 22:19.947
Knew what?

22:19.947 --> 22:22.079
She's having an affair.

22:22.079 --> 22:23.690
Having an affair?

22:23.690 --> 22:25.126
You saw how she left the room
to take a phone call.

22:25.126 --> 22:27.476
I mean, it's not
the first time.

22:27.476 --> 22:31.306
She's been so secretive,
so distant.

22:31.306 --> 22:33.221
Doesn't necessarily mean
she's having an affair.

22:33.221 --> 22:35.919
Dr. Charles, what if
when I grabbed the wheel

22:35.919 --> 22:39.227
it was some kind of
a subconscious thing?

22:39.227 --> 22:42.883
Like, you know,
maybe deep down I wanted--

22:42.883 --> 22:44.275
I can assure you, Fred,
that your condition

22:44.275 --> 22:46.930
is entirely neurological.
OK?

22:46.930 --> 22:50.064
No psychological element.
Nothing subconscious about it.

22:50.064 --> 22:52.022
End of story.

22:52.022 --> 22:54.198
OK.

22:58.464 --> 23:00.509
We're still waiting on the
ambulance to transfer you.

23:00.509 --> 23:02.206
I just put another call in.

23:02.206 --> 23:03.425
Thank you.

23:03.425 --> 23:04.861
Is the pain getting worse?

23:04.861 --> 23:06.689
Yes.
Terrible.

23:06.689 --> 23:08.212
Why don't you
lie on your back

23:08.212 --> 23:09.475
and let me check your stomach?

23:09.475 --> 23:11.433
OK.

23:11.433 --> 23:12.956
Oh.

23:12.956 --> 23:17.526
OK. Ready?

23:20.616 --> 23:24.403
OK.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.100
You're not going anywhere.
I'll be right back.

23:26.100 --> 23:28.407
OK.

23:30.104 --> 23:32.411
- Dr. Archer?
- Yeah?

23:32.411 --> 23:34.456
Sarah Malone,
she's febrile, she's vomiting,

23:34.456 --> 23:36.066
and her BP's soft.

23:36.066 --> 23:37.633
Most likely fully torsed.

23:37.633 --> 23:39.679
She needs an operation now
before her intestine

23:39.679 --> 23:41.202
becomes necrotic.

23:41.202 --> 23:42.464
And by the time
the ambulance gets here

23:42.464 --> 23:43.813
and she's transferred,
admitted--

23:43.813 --> 23:45.336
She could die.

23:45.336 --> 23:47.774
Not gonna wait.

23:47.774 --> 23:50.211
All right.
We'll have the operation here.

23:50.211 --> 23:52.779
OK.
But what about her insurance?

23:52.779 --> 23:54.650
She could be in debt
for the rest of her life.

23:54.650 --> 23:57.174
Unless we do the surgery
off the books.

23:57.174 --> 23:59.307
Of course,
that means Jack Dayton's

23:59.307 --> 24:01.222
for-profit hospital
won't be reimbursed.

24:01.222 --> 24:02.615
Can't say I have a problem
with that.

24:02.615 --> 24:04.051
OK, but how?
How?

24:04.051 --> 24:05.356
We can't take her
to the main OR.

24:05.356 --> 24:06.749
I'll just do it
in her treatment room.

24:06.749 --> 24:08.664
That's all. OK?

24:08.664 --> 24:11.624
Now you use your renowned
powers of persuasion.

24:11.624 --> 24:15.584
Get me an anesthesiologist.
OK?

24:15.584 --> 24:17.368
- Thank you, Dr. Archer.
- Just, the anesthesiologist.

24:17.368 --> 24:19.675
Come on.
- OK.

24:19.675 --> 24:20.937
OK.

24:25.725 --> 24:27.117
OK.

24:27.117 --> 24:29.946
I'm now freeing up the bowel
from the hernia sac.

24:32.122 --> 24:33.428
<i>Warning.</i>

24:33.428 --> 24:34.516
<i>There has been
a full thickness</i>

24:34.516 --> 24:36.213
<i>small bowel enterotomy.</i>

24:36.213 --> 24:38.389
2.0, I have not
injured the intestine.

24:38.389 --> 24:39.869
Please reevaluate.

24:39.869 --> 24:41.741
<i>Protect the field from
gross contamination.</i>

24:41.741 --> 24:44.831
<i>Assess damage and decide
between primary repair</i>

24:44.831 --> 24:45.832
<i>versus resection.</i>

24:45.832 --> 24:47.529
No, that image
is not correct.

24:47.529 --> 24:51.228
2.0, I repeat, I have not cut
into the intestine.

24:51.228 --> 24:52.491
The bowel is intact.

24:52.491 --> 24:54.318
<i>If you do not
address perforation,</i>

24:54.318 --> 24:58.671
<i>there is a 100% chance
patient will become septic.</i>

24:58.671 --> 24:59.976
OK, everyone.

24:59.976 --> 25:01.717
There is no perforation
of the bowel.

25:01.717 --> 25:03.676
No complications of any kind.

25:03.676 --> 25:06.809
2.0 is either off target or
its sensors are malfunctioning.

25:06.809 --> 25:08.985
Dr. Song, would you please
show the gallery

25:08.985 --> 25:10.291
direct view of the field?

25:10.291 --> 25:12.467
Coming up.

25:14.121 --> 25:15.557
OK.

25:15.557 --> 25:17.385
As you all can see,

25:17.385 --> 25:20.475
there is no perforation
of the bowel whatsoever.

25:20.475 --> 25:23.522
<i>Repair bowel perforation immediately.</i>

25:23.522 --> 25:24.958
Dr. Marcel,
should I shut it down?

25:24.958 --> 25:28.091
- Yes.
- Chance of mortality, 90%.

25:28.091 --> 25:29.963
Ladies and gentlemen,
I can assure you all

25:29.963 --> 25:31.617
Mr. Dayton is not at risk.

25:31.617 --> 25:34.620
This is a procedure I've
performed hundreds of times.

25:34.620 --> 25:38.232
I can easily proceed
without 2.0.

25:38.232 --> 25:40.364
Continuing to
reduce the hernia.

25:51.680 --> 25:54.030
- Great, there you are.
- What's up?

25:54.030 --> 25:56.859
Uh, I wondered if you'd
come spot me in a surgery.

25:56.859 --> 25:58.426
Laparotomy.

25:58.426 --> 25:59.601
Spot you?

25:59.601 --> 26:00.776
Yeah.

26:00.776 --> 26:03.649
I'm, uh--I'm feeling
a little wobbly.

26:03.649 --> 26:05.825
I'm an OB, remember?

26:05.825 --> 26:08.088
Don't you want
a surgical resident?

26:08.088 --> 26:11.004
No. See, the circumstances
are unusual.

26:11.004 --> 26:15.095
If admin were to find out about
this, we'd probably get fired.

26:15.095 --> 26:19.012
Ooh, what an incentive.

26:19.012 --> 26:21.971
I take it that
this is important.

26:21.971 --> 26:24.626
It would save
the patient's life.

26:24.626 --> 26:26.410
Kinda why we're here, right?

26:38.161 --> 26:41.687
It's definitely
sigmoid volvulus.

26:41.687 --> 26:43.863
Alpha retractor.

26:49.651 --> 26:50.609
All right.
Yeah?

26:50.609 --> 26:51.653
Yeah.

26:51.653 --> 26:54.569
Help me untwist the sigmoid.

26:54.569 --> 26:56.919
There we go.

26:56.919 --> 26:58.878
Got it?
- Yeah.

26:58.878 --> 27:01.141
That looks viable.

27:01.141 --> 27:05.275
Yeah, but the sigmoid
is really floppy.

27:05.275 --> 27:09.671
Yeah, it just needs to be
resected, and, uh...

27:09.671 --> 27:11.717
and re-anastomosed.

27:11.717 --> 27:13.240
Uh...

27:13.240 --> 27:15.677
- Dr. Archer?
- Yeah.

27:15.677 --> 27:18.593
No, I just--for a second
let me sit down, will you?

27:18.593 --> 27:20.726
OK.

27:20.726 --> 27:23.772
Hannah, you could take over?

27:23.772 --> 27:25.644
- Absolutely.
- All right.

27:25.644 --> 27:27.254
Marty, how's the patient?

27:27.254 --> 27:29.604
She was bone dry, but after
two liters of Ringer's

27:29.604 --> 27:32.085
and one of albumin,
she's making adequate urine.

27:32.085 --> 27:33.260
OK, great.

27:33.260 --> 27:35.915
Let's get this
sigmoid resected.

27:41.877 --> 27:43.879
Janice.

27:43.879 --> 27:45.098
Dr. Charles.

27:45.098 --> 27:47.100
I'm sorry that
I ran out like that.

27:47.100 --> 27:48.623
Is everything OK?

27:48.623 --> 27:50.799
Actually, I just spoke
to my doctor,

27:50.799 --> 27:52.366
and I got some very good news.

27:52.366 --> 27:53.933
Oh, that's who texted you?

27:53.933 --> 27:55.456
Yes.

27:55.456 --> 27:57.719
I had a biopsy
a couple of weeks ago,

27:57.719 --> 28:01.418
and I just found out
that it's negative.

28:01.418 --> 28:04.291
Congratulations.
That's very good news.

28:04.291 --> 28:06.946
Does, um--does your husband
know about this?

28:06.946 --> 28:09.775
No.
I never told him.

28:09.775 --> 28:13.256
Like I said, Fred seemed to
be struggling with something.

28:13.256 --> 28:15.606
I-I guess it was the stroke,
but I didn't know it.

28:15.606 --> 28:19.001
And--anyway, I didn't want
to add to his problems.

28:19.001 --> 28:20.916
I didn't want him to worry.

28:20.916 --> 28:24.311
If I may, I think it might
be a good time to fill him in.

28:24.311 --> 28:27.227
I just--I think
there could be a...

28:27.227 --> 28:29.316
pretty serious misunderstanding
brewing here.

28:29.316 --> 28:31.144
- Oh?
- Yeah.

28:31.144 --> 28:34.234
And, you know,
maybe the sooner, the better.

28:39.805 --> 28:41.894
Hey, Sarah.

28:41.894 --> 28:44.200
You know where you are?

28:44.200 --> 28:46.028
Hospital.

28:46.028 --> 28:47.769
OK. Can you press
against my hand?

28:47.769 --> 28:49.815
- Mm.
- OK, great.

28:49.815 --> 28:51.555
And again.

28:51.555 --> 28:53.427
Good.

28:56.604 --> 28:58.171
Sarah.

28:58.171 --> 28:59.781
You're gonna be just fine.

28:59.781 --> 29:02.828
Mm. Thank you.

29:02.828 --> 29:04.830
You are welcome.

29:12.141 --> 29:14.230
I thought you'd
be dropping by.

29:16.450 --> 29:18.582
2.0 is not ready to
be put on the market.

29:18.582 --> 29:21.150
Not without verification
of its data set.

29:21.150 --> 29:22.804
Right now we don't know
the data sources.

29:22.804 --> 29:25.851
It could be biased or false.

29:25.851 --> 29:27.722
And not only that.

29:27.722 --> 29:30.246
In the wrong hands,
the data could be manipulated.

29:30.246 --> 29:33.206
As you and your friend demonstrated.

29:33.206 --> 29:35.861
Friend? No.

29:35.861 --> 29:37.036
It was just me.

29:37.036 --> 29:38.777
- Just you?
- Yes.

29:38.777 --> 29:40.430
Mm.

29:40.430 --> 29:42.868
I couldn't risk 2.0
killing anyone else.

29:42.868 --> 29:45.087
I appreciate your passion,
Dr. Halstead,

29:45.087 --> 29:46.785
but I don't believe
for a minute

29:46.785 --> 29:50.745
you have the technical
wherewithal to pull that off.

29:50.745 --> 29:54.923
I suspect Dr. Song
had a hand in it.

30:14.900 --> 30:16.336
My letter of resignation.

30:16.336 --> 30:20.079
If Dayton comes looking
for a culprit, you have one.

30:20.079 --> 30:23.343
So your plan is
to take the blame?

30:23.343 --> 30:25.562
Let's just say
I hope it ends the matter.

30:28.696 --> 30:31.438
You realize
I have no choice

30:31.438 --> 30:34.310
but to accept
your resignation?

30:34.310 --> 30:39.315
And I hope you also realize
that I don't want to.

30:39.315 --> 30:42.579
It's not gonna be easy for you
out there, Dr. Halstead.

30:42.579 --> 30:45.321
I can't give you a reference,

30:45.321 --> 30:50.022
and Jack Dayton has been known
to be vindictive.

30:50.022 --> 30:53.025
Where I grew up,
everyone I knew was vindictive.

30:53.025 --> 30:56.637
Will Halstead...

30:56.637 --> 30:59.509
What are we gonna do
without you?

30:59.509 --> 31:03.644
You have been a constant
source of irritation

31:03.644 --> 31:08.692
and a constant source
of inspiration.

31:10.433 --> 31:15.177
Your leaving will be
a great loss to us.

31:18.398 --> 31:20.835
A great loss to me.

31:35.937 --> 31:37.634
You had no right.

31:37.634 --> 31:39.245
I'm just as much to blame
as you are.

31:39.245 --> 31:40.594
No, I put you up to it.

31:40.594 --> 31:42.074
I'm the one
who hacked the system!

31:42.074 --> 31:43.945
- At my insistence.
- Will!

31:43.945 --> 31:45.425
Grace, you're a
brilliant doctor.

31:45.425 --> 31:48.602
If you destroy your career,
I'd never forgive myself.

31:48.602 --> 31:50.430
It's over.

31:50.430 --> 31:53.520
It's done.
Let it go.

31:53.520 --> 31:54.913
- He resigned?
- I know.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.827
2.0?
The malfunction?

31:56.827 --> 31:59.439
Talk to him.

31:59.439 --> 32:01.745
Are you kidding me, Halstead?

32:01.745 --> 32:04.618
Why don't you read me in?

32:04.618 --> 32:06.098
Didn't see a reason to.

32:06.098 --> 32:07.838
What?
To protect me?

32:07.838 --> 32:09.797
Or did you think
I wouldn't go along?

32:09.797 --> 32:12.843
- Does it matter?
- Yes, it matters.

32:12.843 --> 32:15.629
And for the record,
I wouldn't have.

32:15.629 --> 32:16.717
Damn it, man.

32:16.717 --> 32:18.197
I disagree with
Jack and his IPO,

32:18.197 --> 32:19.372
but I never would
have gone this route.

32:19.372 --> 32:20.895
Oh, come on.
You said it yourself.

32:20.895 --> 32:22.679
2.0 wasn't ready.
It needed to be sidelined.

32:22.679 --> 32:24.986
Sidelined, yes.
Blown up, no.

32:24.986 --> 32:26.466
Whatever its faults,
2.0 has been

32:26.466 --> 32:28.163
an incredibly valuable tool--

32:28.163 --> 32:29.817
and now no one's ever
gonna wanna use it.

32:29.817 --> 32:31.601
Crockett,
it was the only way.

32:31.601 --> 32:34.082
It had to be done,
and you know it.

32:36.780 --> 32:38.391
You're still here.

32:38.391 --> 32:40.306
So is 2.0.

32:40.306 --> 32:42.177
Fix it.

32:47.182 --> 32:48.749
I guess they both made some

32:48.749 --> 32:51.186
pretty wild assumptions
about each other.

32:51.186 --> 32:53.710
Yeah. Even after
so many years together.

32:53.710 --> 32:55.060
You know, it seems like
they both feared

32:55.060 --> 32:56.670
there wasn't enough love there
to fully trust.

32:56.670 --> 32:58.019
Amazing, right?

32:58.019 --> 33:03.503
Human beings' capacity
to doubt each other,

33:03.503 --> 33:05.722
doubt ourselves.

33:05.722 --> 33:07.942
Yeah.

33:17.125 --> 33:19.084
Hey.

33:19.084 --> 33:21.956
I was glad to hear
your surgery went well.

33:21.956 --> 33:24.045
That's debatable.

33:24.045 --> 33:26.004
I'm alive,
which I'm grateful for.

33:26.004 --> 33:28.267
Well, from what I understand,

33:28.267 --> 33:31.270
your recovery time
should be minimal.

33:31.270 --> 33:32.967
Yeah.

33:32.967 --> 33:34.795
Only one hitch, though.

33:34.795 --> 33:36.449
2.0?

33:36.449 --> 33:38.364
IPO is dead.

33:38.364 --> 33:39.756
Yeah.

33:39.756 --> 33:41.323
Some of your doctors

33:41.323 --> 33:43.064
were against putting
this platform on the market.

33:43.064 --> 33:44.718
They'll be happy now.

33:44.718 --> 33:46.807
Oh, it's an amazing
innovation, Jack.

33:46.807 --> 33:49.853
It just needs more time
and development.

33:49.853 --> 33:52.943
Right, and who exactly
is gonna fund that?

33:52.943 --> 33:55.381
What do you mean?

33:55.381 --> 33:57.687
I'm ruined, Sharon.

33:57.687 --> 33:58.993
I put all my eggs
in that basket.

33:58.993 --> 34:02.257
I leveraged everything.

34:02.257 --> 34:04.216
I'm sorry to hear that, Jack.

34:04.216 --> 34:06.783
Yeah, well, listen, it's not
the first fortune I lost,

34:06.783 --> 34:09.134
so I'll survive.

34:09.134 --> 34:11.266
Not sure about all of you.

34:11.266 --> 34:14.574
I don't understand.

34:14.574 --> 34:17.620
I have no other recourse
but to sell the hospital.

34:24.801 --> 34:27.282
What are you doing?

34:27.282 --> 34:30.590
I am--
I'm writing a letter to--

34:30.590 --> 34:31.982
to you.

34:31.982 --> 34:34.724
Can I read it?

34:34.724 --> 34:36.639
Sure.

34:39.381 --> 34:42.776
"Dear Liliana."

34:42.776 --> 34:45.257
That's all I got so far.

34:45.257 --> 34:48.129
Daniel,
the problem isn't just

34:48.129 --> 34:50.871
about me moving in with you.

34:50.871 --> 34:53.700
People are always
noticing our differences.

34:53.700 --> 34:55.441
You are the big
important doctor.

34:55.441 --> 34:57.356
I'm just the janitor.

34:57.356 --> 34:59.575
Lili, I gotta be
honest with you.

34:59.575 --> 35:02.143
I mean, you sound an
awful lot like your brother.

35:02.143 --> 35:03.797
Didn't we already
handle this stuff?

35:03.797 --> 35:05.015
You don't feel sorry for me?

35:05.015 --> 35:06.495
You don't think that
I'm a charity case?

35:06.495 --> 35:08.541
I can't feel
a little bit sorry for you?

35:08.541 --> 35:10.064
You lost your frickin' house.

35:10.064 --> 35:11.631
But a charity case?

35:11.631 --> 35:13.807
Are you kidding me?

35:13.807 --> 35:17.289
I look at you and I see this
strong, independent woman.

35:17.289 --> 35:20.205
You know, if anything,
I spent, you know,

35:20.205 --> 35:21.684
a fair amount of time thinking

35:21.684 --> 35:23.904
that I might not
be worthy of you.

35:23.904 --> 35:27.081
What do you mean?

35:27.081 --> 35:29.736
Look, just because
I have a fancy title,

35:29.736 --> 35:33.218
it doesn't mean
I don't wake up with the same

35:33.218 --> 35:36.003
doubts and insecurities
as everybody else.

35:36.003 --> 35:38.484
I mean, you wanna know why

35:38.484 --> 35:40.225
I didn't ask you
to move in with me earlier?

35:40.225 --> 35:44.664
I was probably terrified
you'd say no.

35:44.664 --> 35:47.884
Look.

35:47.884 --> 35:51.105
You...

35:51.105 --> 35:52.672
are the best thing
that's happened to me

35:52.672 --> 35:55.153
in a long, long time,

35:55.153 --> 35:59.244
and I probably could have
told you that earlier too.

35:59.244 --> 36:02.638
So let me just be crystal clear
about something.

36:02.638 --> 36:04.727
OK?

36:04.727 --> 36:08.688
I am in love with you, Liliana.

36:11.386 --> 36:15.173
There you have it.

36:15.173 --> 36:18.437
Then I owe you
an apology, Daniel.

36:18.437 --> 36:20.787
I misunderstood.

36:20.787 --> 36:26.793
It's very hard for me
to feel dependent on someone,

36:26.793 --> 36:30.971
even if I love that person.

36:30.971 --> 36:32.973
Hey! Happy couple.

36:32.973 --> 36:35.105
How nice.

36:35.105 --> 36:38.239
Let's go. I parked the car
in the loading zone.

36:47.205 --> 36:49.163
Hey.
Has Dr. Cameron come in?

36:49.163 --> 36:51.078
Yeah. Yeah.

36:51.078 --> 36:52.601
Antibiotics?

36:52.601 --> 36:55.430
You're septic?

36:55.430 --> 36:57.563
Let me see.

37:02.045 --> 37:03.395
Let me guess.

37:03.395 --> 37:06.920
Bacterial peritonitis from
your dialysis catheter.

37:06.920 --> 37:08.574
Right. Right.
Did you hear about Will?

37:08.574 --> 37:11.403
I did, but we're still
talking about you, Dean.

37:11.403 --> 37:13.753
This is your third infection.

37:13.753 --> 37:15.363
Enough DIY.

37:15.363 --> 37:17.409
You need to be on hemodialysis
in a proper clinical setting.

37:17.409 --> 37:19.193
Oh, three times a week
for four hours?

37:19.193 --> 37:20.586
- Yes.
- No, not for me.

37:20.586 --> 37:22.065
Thank you. Oh, boy.

37:22.065 --> 37:24.111
- Dad.
- Sean, hey.

37:24.111 --> 37:25.765
What's going on?
What's the matter?

37:25.765 --> 37:27.332
It's just a little infection.

37:27.332 --> 37:28.811
Your father needs to switch
to a different type

37:28.811 --> 37:30.030
of dialysis.
- Hannah, come on.

37:30.030 --> 37:32.293
Whoa, wait, wait, wait.
Why--why do that?

37:32.293 --> 37:34.817
I'm here. I'm ready.
Let's do the transplant.

37:38.473 --> 37:40.867
What?

37:40.867 --> 37:42.172
They won't let you.

37:42.172 --> 37:44.218
- Why? I'm a match.
- There's a rule.

37:44.218 --> 37:46.307
You need to be at least
six months sober

37:46.307 --> 37:48.657
in order to donate.

37:51.530 --> 37:53.009
- What have I done?
- No, no, no.

37:53.009 --> 37:54.576
It's not a big deal.

37:54.576 --> 37:58.232
I'll just go on hemodialysis,
like Hannah says.

37:58.232 --> 37:59.451
- Dad.
- Sean, come on.

37:59.451 --> 38:01.104
Please.
It's just six months.

38:01.104 --> 38:03.150
Don't worry about it.

38:19.688 --> 38:22.038
Will?

38:22.038 --> 38:24.171
No.

38:27.696 --> 38:29.698
You can't go.

38:31.961 --> 38:35.400
I have to, Maggie.

38:35.400 --> 38:37.532
I have to.

38:56.377 --> 39:00.990
I'm sorry I have
to say goodbye.

39:00.990 --> 39:04.385
This is not easy.

39:04.385 --> 39:08.650
You've been my family
for so many years.

39:08.650 --> 39:11.610
I'll never forget you.

39:11.610 --> 39:15.527
You will always
be a part of me,

39:15.527 --> 39:19.357
and I'll always be grateful
for the time we had together.

39:23.796 --> 39:27.800
I know we all want to wish
Dr. Halstead the very best.

39:36.852 --> 39:38.724
Thank you.

40:17.153 --> 40:23.638
Will!

40:23.638 --> 40:26.119
Hey, buddy.

40:26.119 --> 40:28.251
Man, look how big you got.

40:28.251 --> 40:31.559
Mom, he's here!

40:31.559 --> 40:32.908
Hey.

40:34.997 --> 40:36.782
Hey.

40:40.568 --> 40:43.310
Is that all you brought?

40:46.661 --> 40:50.491
I didn't know how long
you'd want me to stay.

40:50.491 --> 40:53.320
I'm never gonna let you go.
