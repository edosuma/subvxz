PRESIDENT REAGAN: <i>Air and naval
forces of the United States</i>

00:06.130 --> 00:08.963
<i>launched a series of strikes</i>
<i>against terrorist facilities...</i>

00:08.998 --> 00:10.965
REPORTER: <i>Pan Am Flight 103 crashed
into the town of Lockerbie.</i>

00:10.999 --> 00:12.333
REAGAN: <i>He has sanctioned
acts of terror</i>

00:12.367 --> 00:15.069
<i>in Africa, Europe and</i>
<i>the Middle East.</i>

00:15.104 --> 00:17.772
PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W. BUSH: <i>This will not
stand, this aggression against, uh, Kuwait.</i>

00:17.806 --> 00:19.374
REAGAN: <i>This relentless
pursuit of terror.</i>

00:19.408 --> 00:21.076
PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH:
<i>We will make no distinction...</i>

00:21.110 --> 00:22.677
REPORTER:
<i>The USS</i> Cole <i>was attacked</i>

00:22.712 --> 00:23.845
<i>while refueling in</i>
<i>the port of Aden.</i>

00:23.880 --> 00:25.813
This was an act of terrorism.

00:25.847 --> 00:28.217
It was a despicable
and cowardly act.

00:28.251 --> 00:30.687
<i>The next samba</i>
<i>we're going to swing for you</i>

00:30.721 --> 00:31.821
is one of the good old
favorites.

00:31.855 --> 00:34.323
...until something stops him.

00:34.358 --> 00:37.192
CARRIE: <i>I'm just making sure</i>
<i>we don't get hit again.</i>

00:37.226 --> 00:40.829
MAN: <i>That plane crashed</i>
<i>into the World Trade Center.</i>

00:42.165 --> 00:44.365
<i>Thousands of people running.</i>

00:44.400 --> 00:48.135
We must and we will remain
vigilant at home and abroad.

00:48.170 --> 00:50.304

00:54.777 --> 00:57.145
SAUL:
<i>What the fuck are you doing?</i>

00:57.180 --> 00:59.147
Fuck!

00:59.181 --> 01:01.149
CARRIE: <i>I missed</i>
<i>something once before.</i>

01:01.184 --> 01:04.019
<i>I won't...</i>
<i>I</i> can't <i>let that happen again.</i>

01:05.220 --> 01:07.556
SAUL:
<i>It was ten years ago.</i>

01:07.590 --> 01:09.090
<i>Everyone missed something</i>
<i>that day.</i>

01:09.124 --> 01:11.093

<i>Previously on</i> Homeland...

01:24.207 --> 01:24.774
(grunts)

01:26.443 --> 01:28.411
I'm on to Brody.
He knows something

01:28.445 --> 01:30.413
about Walker's death
and he's covering.

01:30.447 --> 01:31.915
Let's have some fun.

01:31.949 --> 01:34.017
(tires screech)

01:34.051 --> 01:35.585
Yeah!
(laughing)

01:37.254 --> 01:38.822
- Oh!
- No!

01:38.856 --> 01:39.956
See, she's fine,

01:39.990 --> 01:41.291
Dana, okay?
He's calling 911.

01:41.325 --> 01:43.326
There's nothing
we can do about it.

01:43.361 --> 01:44.962
Okay.

01:46.364 --> 01:47.998
My name is Nicholas Brody.

01:48.032 --> 01:51.201
People will say that I was
turned into a terrorist.

01:51.235 --> 01:53.770
- My action this day...
- I was right.

01:53.804 --> 01:56.173
You were right.

01:56.207 --> 01:56.974
Get down on the ground!

01:57.008 --> 01:59.043
(Brody groans)

01:59.077 --> 02:01.078
You're a disgrace to your
nation, Sergeant Nicholas Brody.

02:01.113 --> 02:02.714
You're a traitor
and a terrorist,

02:02.748 --> 02:04.616
and now it's time
to pay for that.

02:04.650 --> 02:06.585
(breathes deeply, yelps)

02:07.887 --> 02:08.854
(groans) When's the attack?!

02:08.889 --> 02:10.056
Talk, you motherfucker!

02:10.090 --> 02:11.824
Get the fuck off of me!

02:11.859 --> 02:14.160
I can do this, Saul.

02:14.195 --> 02:16.196
<i>It's my turn.</i>

02:20.302 --> 02:22.770
What is Abu Nazir's plan?

02:22.805 --> 02:24.873
I don't know.

02:24.907 --> 02:27.275
But there is a plan, right?

02:29.312 --> 02:30.846
Yes.

02:31.915 --> 02:34.284
Who does know the plan?

02:34.318 --> 02:36.119
ROYA:
Nicholas.

02:36.154 --> 02:37.688
We're at war.

02:37.722 --> 02:39.523
You need to choose sides.

02:39.557 --> 02:41.058
JESSICA:
I need the truth, Brody.

02:41.093 --> 02:42.293
No more secrets.

02:42.327 --> 02:45.063
You're gonna think
this is a little crazy, Jess.

02:45.097 --> 02:48.033
I'm working for the CIA.

03:18.399 --> 03:20.400
(indistinct chatter)

03:43.991 --> 03:46.126
QUINN:
Why is she stopping?

03:46.160 --> 03:48.627
She know she being followed?

03:48.662 --> 03:50.229
I don't think so.

03:50.263 --> 03:52.765
Looks like she's just
clearing the area.

03:58.171 --> 03:59.805
She's on the air
in half an hour.

03:59.839 --> 04:01.306
She's going somewhere.

04:01.340 --> 04:02.808
Going somewhere?

04:02.842 --> 04:04.143
- Bold prediction.
- I mean,

04:04.177 --> 04:05.611
meeting someone now.

04:11.819 --> 04:13.486
CARRIE:
Okay, she's moving.

04:16.791 --> 04:18.791
Blue 1 in pursuit.

04:24.965 --> 04:27.800
Towards Garfield Plaza,
it looks like.

04:27.834 --> 04:29.034
Virgil, heads-up,

04:29.069 --> 04:30.703
she'll be coming to you.

04:30.737 --> 04:32.705
VIRGIL:
I'm on it.

04:32.739 --> 04:34.273
QUINN:
We're re-deploying.

04:34.308 --> 04:37.543
Blue 1, take up position
Pennsylvania Avenue. Blue 2,

04:37.578 --> 04:39.578
southeast corner and stand by.

04:45.019 --> 04:46.986
Virgil, Max, get on her.

04:47.020 --> 04:48.888
Copy.

04:48.922 --> 04:50.256
Okay, Max.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.490
She's past.

04:51.524 --> 04:52.991
You can open your eyes now.

04:53.026 --> 04:55.127
Max, wake the fuck up,
will you?

04:55.161 --> 04:56.728
- What?
- We're on.

04:56.763 --> 04:58.130
- Oh. Where is she?
- Oh, and if it's

04:58.164 --> 04:59.498
not too much trouble,
bring your damn mic.

04:59.532 --> 05:01.533
I got it. Okay.

05:06.874 --> 05:08.308
Uh, it's pretty wide open.

05:08.342 --> 05:10.343
Anyone with a camera's gonna
be pretty hard to miss.

05:10.377 --> 05:11.644
It's a public plaza.

05:11.678 --> 05:13.179
There'll be security cams
everywhere. Galvez?

05:13.214 --> 05:14.647
Yeah, got it.

05:14.682 --> 05:15.815
(typing)

05:24.925 --> 05:26.226
Here's where she'll be going.

05:26.260 --> 05:28.661
I mean, she's

05:28.696 --> 05:30.663
a public figure. She has to
accept that she might be seen,

05:30.698 --> 05:32.698
but she won't want to be heard.

05:39.172 --> 05:40.206
(sighs)

05:40.240 --> 05:41.240
Mm.

05:42.275 --> 05:44.276
(rushing water)

05:48.581 --> 05:50.283
QUINN:
Where's audio?

05:50.317 --> 05:52.184
We got to get ears on this.

05:53.286 --> 05:55.287
Got to move closer.

05:59.992 --> 06:02.794
(Roya speaks indistinctly)

06:02.828 --> 06:05.897
Virgil, it sounds
like Niagara Falls.

06:08.533 --> 06:11.635
(indistinct conversation)

06:14.472 --> 06:16.240
- You recognize him?
- No.

06:16.274 --> 06:17.174
Galvez?

06:17.208 --> 06:18.075
A facial recognition won't work.

06:18.109 --> 06:20.344
Not with those glasses.

06:20.378 --> 06:22.947
This is it. This is the meet
we've been waiting for.

06:22.981 --> 06:24.648
Virgil, where the hell is Max?!

06:24.683 --> 06:26.083
We need to hear this.

06:29.488 --> 06:34.458
(indistinct conversation)

06:34.492 --> 06:35.626
C-Can you clean this up?

06:35.660 --> 06:36.660
I'm trying.

06:39.765 --> 06:40.998
Are you recording?

06:41.032 --> 06:42.466
- We've got to get this.
- Carrie.

06:43.868 --> 06:45.802
(indistinct conversation)

06:45.837 --> 06:47.204
(sighs)

06:47.238 --> 06:49.339
(voices fade out)

06:49.374 --> 06:51.475
Damn it!

06:59.418 --> 07:01.286
We've got nothing.

07:04.057 --> 07:05.758
(sighs)

07:06.793 --> 07:08.961
QUINN:
Okay, Blue 1, Blue 2,

07:08.995 --> 07:10.496
do not let that man
out of your sight.

07:10.530 --> 07:11.864
Virgil!

07:11.898 --> 07:13.866
I got him.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.583
(quietly):
Come on.

07:33.019 --> 07:35.020
(subway approaching)

08:02.751 --> 08:05.219
What the hell is going on?
Virgil?!

08:12.861 --> 08:14.495
We just lost him.
(groans)

08:28.545 --> 08:30.513
(opening pill bottle)

08:31.582 --> 08:33.750
How's your hand?

08:33.784 --> 08:35.318
(inhales deeply)

08:35.352 --> 08:37.421
Mm.

08:39.491 --> 08:41.892
(groans) Here.

08:42.928 --> 08:45.897
Every four hours.
(sighs)

08:49.402 --> 08:51.403
(sighs)

08:53.039 --> 08:54.039
(sighs)

08:55.908 --> 08:57.876
(sighs)

08:57.910 --> 08:59.444
Glad you're back.

09:01.080 --> 09:02.046
You are.

09:02.081 --> 09:03.848
Yes.

09:03.883 --> 09:05.150
But I have...

09:05.184 --> 09:06.718
like, a million questions

09:06.752 --> 09:08.153
about this CIA thing.

09:08.187 --> 09:09.187
50 million.

09:09.221 --> 09:11.289
Jessica.

09:11.323 --> 09:12.457
(sighs) I know.

09:12.491 --> 09:13.892
You can't talk about it.

09:13.926 --> 09:15.560
I'm not supposed
to have told you

09:15.594 --> 09:17.595
I was even involved
with them at all.

09:26.672 --> 09:28.540
What do you want to know?

09:31.677 --> 09:33.211
Ask me anything.

09:33.246 --> 09:35.447
I'll tell you
if I possibly can.

09:42.389 --> 09:44.423
No, it's nothing.

09:44.458 --> 09:46.926
Shit, it's late.
Dana's not even up yet.

09:51.198 --> 09:52.966
Dana. Come on.
It's almost 7:30.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.167
You're gonna be late.

09:54.202 --> 09:56.837
(groans) Come on.

09:56.871 --> 09:58.271
I'm sick.

09:59.908 --> 10:01.476
Since when?

10:04.447 --> 10:06.648
- You feel fine.
- I'm not.

10:06.682 --> 10:08.183
Come on. Up!

10:08.217 --> 10:10.485
Let's go.

10:25.034 --> 10:27.436
GALVEZ: There he is exiting
the Meridian Hill station

10:27.470 --> 10:28.637
a few minutes later.

10:28.671 --> 10:30.806
Without the sunglasses.

10:30.840 --> 10:33.108
No match from facial
recognition though.

10:33.143 --> 10:37.979
Great, so we don't know
where he is or who he is.

10:38.014 --> 10:40.749
Did you try her classmates
at Oxford?

10:40.783 --> 10:41.917
Yeah.

10:41.951 --> 10:44.687
Uh, coworkers from
the TV station in Yemen?

10:44.721 --> 10:46.356
Yep. And everyone else

10:46.390 --> 10:48.525
related to everything
we know about her.

10:48.559 --> 10:50.527
Tried them all.
No match anywhere.

10:50.562 --> 10:52.596
Well, keep trying.

10:56.134 --> 10:57.701
We got a clean picture.

10:57.736 --> 11:00.871
We can see the motherfucker
clearly, still no ID.

11:00.905 --> 11:02.039
And no sound.

11:02.073 --> 11:03.874
That's as good as it gets.

11:03.909 --> 11:05.910
You know what we need to do.

11:05.944 --> 11:08.678
Bring Brody in, see if
he can identify the guy.

11:08.713 --> 11:11.248
Think that's a good idea,
letting Brody in on this?

11:11.282 --> 11:13.483
He already knows more
than enough to sink us.

11:13.517 --> 11:16.086
If he wants to take stuff to
the other side he already can.

11:16.120 --> 11:17.721
Look,

11:17.755 --> 11:20.357
the only reason we even knew
to follow Roya is Brody.

11:20.392 --> 11:21.759
The only reason we saw her

11:21.793 --> 11:24.829
meet that man,
whoever he is, is Brody.

11:24.863 --> 11:26.030
Okay.

11:27.733 --> 11:29.934
We made a deal with him.
It's in his best interest

11:29.968 --> 11:32.202
- to help us.
- I said okay.

11:33.238 --> 11:35.206
Bring Brody in.

11:35.240 --> 11:37.941
But don't trust him;
that's all I'm saying.

11:54.025 --> 11:55.459
Is she moving?

11:55.493 --> 11:56.793
Didn't look like.

11:56.828 --> 11:58.429
(sighs)

11:58.463 --> 12:00.431
Dana!

12:02.800 --> 12:04.134
Where's Chris?

12:04.168 --> 12:05.602
He had early practice.

12:05.636 --> 12:07.403
Left an hour ago.

12:07.438 --> 12:08.839
(phone vibrating) Dana!

12:08.873 --> 12:10.240
DANA:
I'm coming!

12:10.275 --> 12:12.309
There's something going on
with her, Brody.

12:12.343 --> 12:14.344
I don't like it.

12:15.647 --> 12:17.514
Brody.

12:19.083 --> 12:20.818
Huh?

12:20.852 --> 12:22.953
What is it?

12:22.988 --> 12:24.989
Langley wants me.

12:27.859 --> 12:30.327
Hey. Really. See for
yourself, take a look.

12:33.665 --> 12:35.633
Jess?

12:38.837 --> 12:41.539
I'm not saying I'm deserving
of your trust, not at all...

12:41.573 --> 12:43.341
Who are you working with?

12:45.344 --> 12:48.346
You asked me what
I wanted to know. That's it.

12:48.380 --> 12:50.448
Who are you working with
at the CIA?

12:50.482 --> 12:53.284
Is it her again? Carrie?

12:53.319 --> 12:55.220
- No.
- The nut?

12:55.254 --> 12:58.823
No. I told you,
she had a nervous breakdown.

13:00.726 --> 13:02.694
They kicked her out.

13:02.728 --> 13:05.197
She's not even
at the CIA anymore.

13:12.805 --> 13:16.241
If I have to go to school,
I'm going to need a ride.

13:20.046 --> 13:22.547
Come on, sleepy.

13:42.869 --> 13:45.304
(Brody sighs)

13:45.338 --> 13:48.007
No good?

13:50.610 --> 13:53.346
Just not hungry.

13:53.380 --> 13:56.082
You okay?

13:56.116 --> 13:58.084
Yeah.

13:58.118 --> 14:00.920
I'm fine.

14:12.066 --> 14:14.334
Are you okay?

14:14.369 --> 14:16.403
Yeah, I'm fine.

14:18.305 --> 14:20.873
Stop, Dad.

14:20.907 --> 14:22.107
Let me out.

14:26.346 --> 14:29.380
Thanks for the ride.

14:30.416 --> 14:32.116
(passenger door closes)

14:59.344 --> 15:01.712
You look tired.

15:01.747 --> 15:04.148
Yeah, so I've heard.

15:04.182 --> 15:05.916
Just take it easy.

15:05.951 --> 15:09.220
Sure. After we hit someone with
your car, just take it easy?

15:09.254 --> 15:11.222
She's going to be okay.

15:11.256 --> 15:13.223
You don't know that.

15:13.258 --> 15:15.059
Yes, I do.

15:15.093 --> 15:17.428
Someone called 911.
We saw that.

15:17.462 --> 15:19.630
There's a hospital
a couple miles away.

15:19.664 --> 15:21.532
An ambulance would have
gotten her there

15:21.566 --> 15:22.867
in, like, ten minutes, max.

15:22.901 --> 15:25.336
She's gonna be fine.

15:26.404 --> 15:28.372
Okay?

15:28.407 --> 15:30.808
Yeah.

15:30.842 --> 15:32.843
(school bell ringing)

15:33.845 --> 15:35.946
Come on. School's
about to start.

15:35.980 --> 15:37.982
I got an AP history test
first period.

15:38.016 --> 15:42.219
I think that I'm gonna just...
take it easy

15:42.254 --> 15:44.221
a minute.

15:44.256 --> 15:46.824
Okay. Yeah.

15:46.859 --> 15:48.860
See you at lunch then.

15:57.802 --> 15:59.803
(buzzer sounds)

16:01.206 --> 16:03.207
GUARD:
He's here.

16:09.113 --> 16:11.148
I'll get him.

16:18.957 --> 16:20.591
Hey.

16:20.625 --> 16:22.426
You texted for me to come here?

16:22.460 --> 16:24.428
Yeah.

16:29.634 --> 16:31.601
How are you?

16:31.636 --> 16:33.637
Not too bad,
actually. Yeah.

16:33.671 --> 16:36.506
Taking a lot of painkillers
for the hole in my hand.

16:36.540 --> 16:38.574
- Is he here?
- Yeah.

16:38.609 --> 16:40.376
Quinn?

16:40.411 --> 16:42.779
Did it go all right
when you got home?

16:42.814 --> 16:44.448
Yeah, I think so.

16:44.482 --> 16:46.449
Told Jessica I was
working for the CIA.

16:46.484 --> 16:49.452
She seemed to believe me.

16:49.486 --> 16:51.454
Asked if you were involved.

16:51.488 --> 16:54.090
I said no.

16:54.124 --> 16:56.092
Okay.

16:56.126 --> 16:58.828
So, what am I doing here?

16:58.863 --> 17:01.030
Um, the deal we talked about.

17:01.065 --> 17:04.367
You helping us get Abu Nazir
in exchange for immunity.

17:04.401 --> 17:06.502
If you're still willing,
it starts now.

17:06.537 --> 17:08.503
I'll help you through it.

17:08.539 --> 17:10.506
What do you want me to do?

17:10.540 --> 17:12.875
We're hoping you can identify
someone in a photo.

17:12.909 --> 17:14.577
That's it?

17:14.611 --> 17:16.244
For the moment, yeah.

17:16.279 --> 17:18.079
I mean, generally
won't be this easy,

17:18.114 --> 17:21.616
but for now,
that's what we need.

17:23.952 --> 17:26.753
Never seen him before.

17:26.788 --> 17:28.756
You're sure?

17:28.790 --> 17:30.791
Yeah.

17:31.792 --> 17:33.994
And by the way,

17:34.028 --> 17:35.962
I don't appreciate
having a car on my tail

17:35.996 --> 17:37.831
when I'm driving
my daughter to school.

17:37.865 --> 17:40.200
Lot of things about this
arrangement far from ideal.

18:13.601 --> 18:16.069
You know what?
I think I should get going.

18:16.103 --> 18:18.038
I have a busy day ahead of me.

18:18.072 --> 18:20.541
QUINN:
You're absolutely sure?

18:20.575 --> 18:22.710
You're absolutely sure that

18:22.744 --> 18:24.546
you don't know anything
that could help us?

18:24.580 --> 18:25.714
Yeah, like, I said,

18:25.748 --> 18:27.082
I've never seen him before.

18:27.117 --> 18:28.484
That's not what I asked,

18:28.518 --> 18:30.385
though, is it?

18:31.421 --> 18:33.555
I don't know anything about him.

18:33.589 --> 18:35.457
But you know something.

18:35.492 --> 18:37.493
CARRIE:
Brody?

19:05.523 --> 19:07.491
I told you about this guy.

19:07.525 --> 19:09.860
The tailor from Gettysburg
who made my suicide vest.

19:09.894 --> 19:11.595
CARRIE: Yeah.
We still can't find him.

19:11.629 --> 19:13.597
You're not gonna.

19:18.269 --> 19:20.237
He's dead.

19:22.941 --> 19:24.908
Roya asked me to move him

19:24.943 --> 19:27.745
on the day of that fund-raiser
I missed.

19:27.779 --> 19:30.348
I was supposed
to take him to a safe house,

19:30.382 --> 19:31.983
and, uh...

19:32.017 --> 19:33.684
(clears throat)
...he died on the way.

19:33.719 --> 19:35.519
He died?

19:35.554 --> 19:36.887
Yeah, it was an accident.

19:36.922 --> 19:39.223
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

19:39.258 --> 19:41.292
He thought
I was trying to kill him,

19:41.326 --> 19:42.960
and he bolted, and he fell.

19:42.995 --> 19:45.229
I have got a six-man
surveillance team

19:45.264 --> 19:47.598
round the clock watching
a storefront in Gettysburg,

19:47.633 --> 19:50.035
waiting for somebody
that you couldn't be bothered

19:50.069 --> 19:51.903
to tell us is never coming back!

19:51.938 --> 19:53.638
I didn't know you were
watching the storefront.

19:53.673 --> 19:55.306
- You never tell me anything.
- The deal is

19:55.341 --> 19:57.242
full fucking disclosure,
not pick and choose

19:57.276 --> 19:59.411
- what you say!
- Wait here.

20:06.085 --> 20:08.052
(sighs heavily)

20:08.087 --> 20:10.421
(whispering): The guy is
a pathological liar.

20:10.456 --> 20:11.989
No, it's my fault.

20:12.024 --> 20:13.591
I never pressed him
in the debrief.

20:13.625 --> 20:15.393
Yeah, and I wonder
why that was.

20:15.427 --> 20:17.394
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I don't know, Carrie.

20:17.429 --> 20:19.129
In the interrogation room,
you said you wanted him

20:19.164 --> 20:20.831
to leave his wife
and run away with you?

20:20.866 --> 20:22.667
And you put a knife
through his hand.

20:22.701 --> 20:24.268
The difference being,
what I did worked.

20:24.302 --> 20:25.936
So don't worry
about <i>my</i> objectivity.

20:25.971 --> 20:28.072
Worry about your own.

20:30.209 --> 20:33.044
At least we know now that
the tailor's not coming back.

20:33.078 --> 20:34.612
We can lose the surveillance,

20:34.647 --> 20:36.714
go in and search
the shop finally.

20:36.749 --> 20:38.249
Maybe find something.

20:41.486 --> 20:43.120
I'll put a forensics team
together

20:43.155 --> 20:44.622
and take him to Gettysburg.

20:46.625 --> 20:48.626
Thank you.

20:58.070 --> 21:00.137
The tailor's dead.

21:00.171 --> 21:02.440
He handled their munitions.

21:02.474 --> 21:04.876
If this new guy turns out
to be his replacement,

21:04.910 --> 21:07.345
we need a line on him fast.

21:07.379 --> 21:09.514
We need to run Brody
back to Roya.

21:09.548 --> 21:11.850
Have him try
to get something out of her

21:11.885 --> 21:13.185
about the guy's identity.

21:13.220 --> 21:14.487
Yeah, good luck with that.

21:14.521 --> 21:16.455
Take a look at him.
The guy's a fucking mess.

21:16.490 --> 21:18.458
I think he's all we've got.

21:22.197 --> 21:25.032
Fine. Your call...

21:25.067 --> 21:26.367
but Carrie...

21:26.401 --> 21:28.369
Don't trust him.

21:28.404 --> 21:30.638
Yeah, you said.

21:33.409 --> 21:35.377
(horn honking, rain pouring)

21:36.679 --> 21:38.647
So you're a Marine?

21:38.681 --> 21:40.983
I am. It shocks me, too.

21:41.017 --> 21:42.651
With Tom Walker?

21:42.685 --> 21:44.520
Yeah. And Mikey here.

21:44.554 --> 21:46.989
So do you know what happened?

21:47.023 --> 21:48.724
To make him crack?

21:48.758 --> 21:51.093
I have a few theories
on that subject, yes.

21:51.127 --> 21:53.028
Actually, like I said
on the phone, Detective,

21:53.062 --> 21:55.531
we were hoping that you could
give us some facts

21:55.565 --> 21:57.199
about how he died.

21:57.233 --> 21:59.368
Oh, I found him here.

21:59.402 --> 22:01.070
Homeless guy heard a gunshot,

22:01.104 --> 22:03.706
alerted a patrol officer
who called Homicide.

22:03.740 --> 22:07.710
He was lying, uh...
yea, head there.

22:07.744 --> 22:09.679
Single bullet right
between the eyes.

22:09.713 --> 22:11.614
Point-blank, more or less.

22:11.648 --> 22:13.883
Blood spatter, uh... there.

22:13.917 --> 22:16.385
You probably can't
see anything now.

22:16.420 --> 22:19.521
Single nine-millimeter casing
on the ground right there.

22:19.556 --> 22:22.057
LAUDER:
It's nine-millimeter.

22:22.091 --> 22:24.226
Standard military issue.

22:24.260 --> 22:26.361
It's standard everything issue.

22:26.395 --> 22:28.129
Sure.

22:28.164 --> 22:31.232
But you know what I'm thinking?

22:31.267 --> 22:33.668
No, Lauder, what
are you thinking?

22:33.702 --> 22:36.071
This place?

22:36.105 --> 22:38.640
Not exactly public.

22:38.674 --> 22:40.842
I wouldn't step foot
in here at night,

22:40.876 --> 22:44.479
except with someone
I knew and trusted.

22:46.315 --> 22:48.283
Sir, can we see your report?

22:48.317 --> 22:51.285
Report? I thought you knew.

22:51.320 --> 22:53.988
After 20 minutes, the CIA
swooped in and shut us down.

22:54.023 --> 22:55.990
CIA.

22:56.025 --> 22:58.293
I wonder what elected official
they were covering up for.

22:58.327 --> 23:00.061
- Lauder.
- What national figure.

23:00.095 --> 23:01.162
Shut up!

23:01.196 --> 23:03.131
Uh, maybe I'll, uh...

23:03.165 --> 23:05.767
I'll give you two a moment.

23:07.204 --> 23:09.171
What was our deal?

23:09.205 --> 23:11.106
No mentioning Brody.

23:11.140 --> 23:13.108
Well, don't pretend
you're not thinking

23:13.142 --> 23:14.843
he's suspect #1.

23:14.877 --> 23:18.580
You're a military
intelligence officer.

23:18.614 --> 23:22.317
There must be some way
you can find out what happened.

23:25.388 --> 23:27.355
Yeah, I might know a guy.

23:27.390 --> 23:29.157
You might know a guy.
That's fucking rousing.

23:29.191 --> 23:30.926
At the CIA.

23:30.960 --> 23:34.163
I reckon he's not going to give
me any classified information.

23:36.299 --> 23:38.800
He might just nod if we're
on the right track, though.

23:38.835 --> 23:40.802
Okay?

23:52.048 --> 23:54.049
(elevator bell dings,
indistinct voice over PA)

24:29.755 --> 24:31.723
(rhythmic beeping
and machines whooshing)

25:18.002 --> 25:19.636
Do I know you?

25:21.940 --> 25:24.308
No.

25:24.342 --> 25:26.310
I'm sorry.

25:26.344 --> 25:28.111
Do you know my mother?

25:29.147 --> 25:31.114
No.

25:32.149 --> 25:34.517
I...

25:34.551 --> 25:37.119
I was looking for someone else.

25:38.155 --> 25:41.123
Will she be okay?

25:41.157 --> 25:43.758
Your mom?

25:43.793 --> 25:46.261
They don't know.

25:48.597 --> 25:51.265
She <i>was</i> doing okay.

25:51.300 --> 25:55.636
And a few hours ago, a clot
kicked loose in her head.

25:55.671 --> 25:58.540
Some idiots hit her
in a car, then took off.

26:02.378 --> 26:04.912
So...

26:04.947 --> 26:07.581
which one's yours?

26:10.552 --> 26:13.387
Who are you visiting?

26:16.425 --> 26:18.593
I'm... not.

26:18.627 --> 26:20.862
You said you were
looking for someone.

26:20.896 --> 26:23.665
Oh. Um...

26:23.699 --> 26:26.101
my dad.

26:26.136 --> 26:28.104
He's a doctor.

26:28.138 --> 26:31.007
He's, um... a cardiologist.

26:31.041 --> 26:33.409
A doctor.

26:34.478 --> 26:36.412
You're lucky.

26:41.051 --> 26:43.219
I didn't know him
when I was little.

26:43.253 --> 26:45.221
He wasn't around.

26:47.658 --> 26:49.625
The nurse--

26:49.660 --> 26:54.030
she said call our priest.

26:54.064 --> 26:56.032
(rhythmic beeping,
indistinct chattering)

26:58.836 --> 27:00.103
(door opening)

27:00.137 --> 27:01.838
MAN:
Have a line going.

27:01.872 --> 27:03.873
(indistinct chattering)

27:06.343 --> 27:09.145
(loud breathing)

27:09.179 --> 27:11.447
(indistinct chattering)

27:11.481 --> 27:13.483
(breathing loudly)

27:15.219 --> 27:17.254
(panting)

27:21.025 --> 27:23.092
(loud panting)

27:23.127 --> 27:25.428
(banging on outer door)

27:25.462 --> 27:27.864
(panting)

27:37.040 --> 27:39.141
(elevator bell dings)

27:57.394 --> 28:00.129
(door opening)

28:01.532 --> 28:03.299
(door squeaks shut)

28:03.333 --> 28:05.301
It's late.

28:05.335 --> 28:07.336
I'm just gathering my thoughts.

28:08.839 --> 28:11.174
I'm going to hit Brody tomorrow
about approaching Roya.

28:11.208 --> 28:13.209
So I've heard.
(sighs)

28:13.243 --> 28:15.778
I also heard it got
a little nasty with Quinn today.

28:15.812 --> 28:17.079
Yeah, well, in my opinion,

28:17.113 --> 28:19.615
it <i>starts</i> nasty with that guy,
but whatever.

28:23.286 --> 28:24.986
Wait. Is that why you're here?

28:25.021 --> 28:27.088
I just want to make sure
you're good.

28:29.492 --> 28:31.860
He said not
to trust Brody, Saul.

28:31.894 --> 28:34.362
(laughs)

28:34.397 --> 28:35.864
He's right.

28:35.898 --> 28:37.999
Yeah, well, if you'll remember,

28:38.033 --> 28:39.667
I'm the one who came up
with that theory,

28:39.701 --> 28:41.302
back when everyone else
was calling him

28:41.336 --> 28:43.604
the patriot of the century.

28:46.341 --> 28:49.077
You don't know what it's like.

28:49.111 --> 28:51.679
What?

28:51.713 --> 28:54.415
Having everyone assume
you're at your worst,

28:54.449 --> 28:56.417
like you can't see straight.

28:56.452 --> 28:58.419
No one thinks that.

28:58.453 --> 29:00.487
Really? (scoffs)

29:00.522 --> 29:02.790
I don't, not at all.

29:08.663 --> 29:11.532
I do worry about you being
so close to Brody again.

29:15.471 --> 29:17.638
It's not like before, Saul.

29:17.673 --> 29:19.373
Good.

29:19.408 --> 29:22.844
I saw his suicide tape.
My eyes are open.

29:22.878 --> 29:25.514
How could they not be?

29:25.548 --> 29:27.549
That's all I wanted to hear.

29:47.539 --> 29:49.807
(tires squeal)

29:49.842 --> 29:51.843
MAN:
All clear.

30:01.485 --> 30:03.453
Make sure the evidence
response team

30:03.488 --> 30:04.821
has whatever support they need.

30:04.856 --> 30:06.056
And crack the whip, huh?

30:06.090 --> 30:08.358
We should have been
in here weeks ago.

30:10.295 --> 30:12.763
All right, everybody, we're
looking for names of contacts,

30:12.797 --> 30:15.999
material suppliers,
anything out of the ordinary.

30:16.034 --> 30:17.934
If you have a question, ask.

30:17.969 --> 30:19.402
No detail is too small.

30:19.437 --> 30:20.937
Uh, you?

30:20.971 --> 30:22.305
Chapman, sir.

30:22.339 --> 30:24.040
You and you, come with me.

30:31.215 --> 30:33.216
Start here.

30:42.427 --> 30:44.594
(chimes tinkling)

30:47.465 --> 30:49.432
Small town.

30:49.467 --> 30:52.469
Likely to be some theorizing
about our presence here, so,

30:52.503 --> 30:54.905
any lookie-loos drop by
wondering what we're up to,

30:54.939 --> 30:56.940
tell them, um...

30:59.176 --> 31:00.643
Tell them...

31:00.678 --> 31:02.379
What?

31:02.413 --> 31:04.414
Sales tax audit.

31:34.546 --> 31:36.513
(sighs)

31:41.319 --> 31:43.153
Greg said you had
a committee meeting

31:43.188 --> 31:45.689
at 10:00. I thought
I'd grab you beforehand.

31:45.724 --> 31:47.291
What do you want?
(sighs)

31:47.325 --> 31:48.859
The photo
we showed you yesterday.

31:48.893 --> 31:51.561
- I told you, I don't know who the guy is.
- I know.

31:51.596 --> 31:53.129
- Well, it's the truth.
- I believe you.

31:53.164 --> 31:54.430
But his appearance here means

31:54.465 --> 31:56.232
whatever Nazir has planned
is happening now,

31:56.266 --> 31:58.267
and that guy is a part of it.

31:58.301 --> 32:00.536
We can't ID him
in any of our databases.

32:00.570 --> 32:02.772
We need your help.
(grunts)

32:02.806 --> 32:05.207
Roya has an interview
with Congressman Mackie

32:05.241 --> 32:06.775
at noon today in this building.

32:06.810 --> 32:09.110
Well, I can't just walk up to
her and ask her who the guy is.

32:09.145 --> 32:11.212
- I know.
- Oh, she tells me what to do.

32:11.247 --> 32:12.447
That's how this works.

32:12.481 --> 32:14.349
You told her
we've been seeing each other.

32:14.384 --> 32:16.285
- Right?
- I told her we've been fucking, yeah.

32:16.319 --> 32:17.886
Okay. Good.

32:17.921 --> 32:19.888
So, tell her
you were at my place,

32:19.923 --> 32:21.657
you overheard me
talking on the phone

32:21.691 --> 32:23.826
about a Hezbollah operative who
recently entered the country.

32:23.860 --> 32:25.328
Is that what he
is? Hezbollah?

32:25.362 --> 32:26.496
That's our guess.

32:26.530 --> 32:27.797
What if it's wrong?

32:27.831 --> 32:30.032
- It shouldn't be a problem.
- Shouldn't be...

32:30.067 --> 32:32.168
Brody, this is how it works.

32:32.203 --> 32:35.272
You put out a little feeler,
you see what comes back.

32:35.306 --> 32:37.741
Just don't push it,
and you'll be fine.

32:37.775 --> 32:39.710
Okay?

32:42.714 --> 32:45.516
You ask me to approach Roya,

32:45.551 --> 32:48.653
I say it's a bad idea,
then you do this.

32:48.688 --> 32:50.589
For what? What is this?

32:50.623 --> 32:52.691
Sex? Understanding?

32:54.794 --> 32:56.762
If that doesn't work,
then what?

32:56.796 --> 32:59.298
You remind me of the
deal that we made,

32:59.332 --> 33:01.333
how much it hurts,
your even bringing it up,

33:01.368 --> 33:03.702
how my entire family
will be destroyed

33:03.737 --> 33:05.838
if you're forced to
tell them the truth?

33:05.872 --> 33:07.840
Brody...

33:08.975 --> 33:10.942
Don't worry.

33:10.977 --> 33:13.045
I'll talk to her for you.

33:13.079 --> 33:15.547
The new phone I gave you--
have it on you.

33:26.592 --> 33:28.760
(sighs)

33:28.794 --> 33:30.795
(elevator bell dings)

33:31.797 --> 33:34.333
Mike Faber?

33:34.367 --> 33:36.034
- Yes.
- Saul Berenson.

33:36.068 --> 33:37.602
I understand
you had some questions

33:37.637 --> 33:40.238
about the investigation of
Tom Walker's death a year ago.

33:40.273 --> 33:42.573
Yeah. I'm meeting a friend
of mine here,

33:42.608 --> 33:43.808
Glenn Peterson?

33:43.843 --> 33:45.710
Glenn passed your request
for information onto me.

33:45.745 --> 33:47.946
This way.

33:54.421 --> 33:56.756
Okay, do you want to tell me
what's going on?

33:56.790 --> 33:58.758
Please.

34:04.465 --> 34:06.466
(sighs)

34:08.335 --> 34:10.571
Sit.

34:15.944 --> 34:17.444
(sighs)

34:17.478 --> 34:19.513
We spoke once before,
you and I.

34:19.547 --> 34:21.449
I remember.

34:21.483 --> 34:23.518
It was right after
Brody got back. You, uh,

34:23.552 --> 34:25.518
strong-armed me into
getting him to enlist.

34:25.554 --> 34:27.522
What I did was discuss with you

34:27.556 --> 34:29.090
what was best
for Sergeant Brody

34:29.123 --> 34:31.692
and his family,
and for this country,

34:31.726 --> 34:33.994
which is what we need
to talk about again.

34:34.029 --> 34:36.263
I'm told you've been
making inquiries

34:36.297 --> 34:37.831
into Thomas Walker's death.

34:37.866 --> 34:39.966
I have a few questions,
yeah, but...

34:40.000 --> 34:42.301
I don't need a GS-15
to answer them.

34:42.335 --> 34:45.271
I'm afraid I don't have
any answers for you, Major.

34:45.304 --> 34:47.273
I'm surprised.

34:47.306 --> 34:49.608
Homicide cop told me
that the, uh, CIA

34:49.643 --> 34:50.743
took over the investigation.

34:50.777 --> 34:51.944
Oh, we did.

34:51.978 --> 34:53.378
And nothing yet.

34:53.411 --> 34:56.947
So, in other words, sir,
I'm being stonewalled.

34:56.983 --> 34:59.317
Well, I wouldn't use
those words.

34:59.352 --> 35:02.520
Do you know
who killed Tom Walker?

35:02.555 --> 35:05.456
No.

35:05.491 --> 35:08.693
Because I'm thinking
it was a coconspirator.

35:08.728 --> 35:10.662
SAUL:
Major?

35:10.696 --> 35:13.966
You're being told by

35:14.000 --> 35:16.535
fellow intelligence
officers, respectfully

35:16.569 --> 35:19.538
at this point,
not to pursue your

35:19.573 --> 35:22.341
unauthorized
freelance investigation

35:22.376 --> 35:25.745
into a matter
of national security.

35:25.779 --> 35:28.681
Nod your head
if you understand.

35:42.896 --> 35:45.731
(indistinct chattering)

35:45.765 --> 35:47.433
Thank you.

35:47.468 --> 35:49.435
Roya!

35:55.610 --> 35:57.678
ROYA:
Congressman Brody.

35:58.713 --> 36:01.047
I hope this is
Congressional business.

36:01.082 --> 36:02.382
No.

36:02.417 --> 36:03.917
Then follow protocol.

36:03.952 --> 36:05.953
I'll contact you.

36:08.056 --> 36:10.291
I got something
I think you should know.

36:10.326 --> 36:12.327
Okay, here we go.

36:14.530 --> 36:17.498
I was at Carrie Mathison's
apartment last night.

36:19.101 --> 36:21.736
She got a phone call, late.

36:21.770 --> 36:23.738
Heard her talking
about some person

36:23.772 --> 36:25.940
just landed in the country.

36:25.975 --> 36:28.043
Hezbollah, she said.

36:28.077 --> 36:29.711
Who called her?

36:29.745 --> 36:31.713
I don't know.

36:31.747 --> 36:33.481
- But you're sure she said Hezbollah?
- Uh-huh.

36:33.516 --> 36:37.385
BRODY:
It's a pretty distinctive word.

36:37.419 --> 36:39.387
I just thought
you'd want to hear.

36:39.421 --> 36:42.724
I do. Thank you.

36:42.758 --> 36:44.893
What happened to your hand?

36:44.927 --> 36:46.928
Oh, home improvements.

36:46.962 --> 36:48.930
Hurts like a motherfucker.

36:50.533 --> 36:52.934
(touch tones sounding)

36:52.968 --> 36:56.003
CARRIE: Okay, Virgil, what
happened to our audio?

36:59.974 --> 37:01.775
We lost audio.

37:01.809 --> 37:03.843
VIRGIL: No, they're
just not talking.

37:03.878 --> 37:05.578
CARRIE:
Well, fucking

37:05.613 --> 37:08.248
say something, Brody,
say something.

37:08.282 --> 37:10.750
VIRGIL: They're worried
about that guy back there.

37:15.455 --> 37:19.592
FBI forensics went
into the tailor shop.

37:19.626 --> 37:21.026
After sitting on it
for two weeks,

37:21.061 --> 37:24.263
they finally went in today.

37:24.297 --> 37:25.464
Any idea why?

37:25.498 --> 37:26.665
BRODY:
No.

37:27.733 --> 37:29.734
Will they find anything?

37:31.103 --> 37:33.104
They might.

37:46.352 --> 37:48.353
(school bell ringing)

37:49.823 --> 37:51.790
Dana, what the fuck?

37:51.824 --> 37:53.526
You've been avoiding me.

37:53.560 --> 37:55.494
I'm not avoiding anyone.
I'm standing in the middle of the hall.

37:59.399 --> 38:00.365
She wasn't all right, Finn.

38:00.400 --> 38:02.634
She was dying.

38:04.370 --> 38:07.273
What?

38:07.307 --> 38:10.309
She died in the middle
of the night.

38:19.019 --> 38:21.086
We can't talk about this, Dana.

38:21.121 --> 38:22.421
If not here, then, okay, where?

38:22.455 --> 38:23.856
Nowhere. We can't talk
about it anywhere.

38:25.225 --> 38:27.193
We have to tell someone.

38:27.227 --> 38:29.095
No, we don't.
We agreed to stay quiet.

38:29.129 --> 38:32.198
Yeah, that was
before she... died.

38:32.232 --> 38:34.767
It's even more important now.

38:35.803 --> 38:37.771
Finn...

38:38.940 --> 38:40.908
I met her daughter.

38:40.942 --> 38:43.745
You what?

38:44.780 --> 38:47.549
At the hospital.

38:47.583 --> 38:49.551
She's all alone now.

38:49.585 --> 38:52.487
You went to the hospital.

38:52.521 --> 38:54.289
Are you crazy?

38:54.323 --> 38:57.125
What is wrong with you?

38:57.159 --> 38:59.694
What is wrong with you?
What the fuck is wrong...?

39:00.763 --> 39:03.866
Jesus... your dad
is a congressman.

39:03.900 --> 39:06.902
- Mine is going to be president.
- Yeah, and her mom is dead.

39:06.937 --> 39:09.271
She needs our help.

39:09.306 --> 39:10.272
No, I do.

39:10.307 --> 39:11.841
All right?
I need our help.

39:11.875 --> 39:12.975
I was driving, not you.

39:13.009 --> 39:14.977
This comes down on me,

39:15.011 --> 39:16.645
and, swear to God,
I'd rather die

39:16.680 --> 39:18.314
than have my father find out.

39:18.348 --> 39:21.350
If you say anything
about this, I'm dead.

39:21.384 --> 39:23.352
I mean it.

39:42.406 --> 39:43.773
Anything?

39:43.807 --> 39:45.407
Doesn't seem like it, not yet.

39:45.442 --> 39:47.610
(phone ringing)

39:51.215 --> 39:53.182
Yeah, Carrie.

39:53.217 --> 39:54.917
Brody just talked to Roya.

39:54.952 --> 39:56.919
Yeah, how'd that go?

39:56.954 --> 39:58.688
I'm not quite sure.

39:58.722 --> 40:00.490
She knows you're at Gettysburg.

40:00.524 --> 40:01.691
She does. How?

40:01.725 --> 40:03.426
Maybe they're watching.
I don't know.

40:03.461 --> 40:05.295
She said there's
something there.

40:05.329 --> 40:06.529
Have you found anything?

40:06.564 --> 40:08.031
A lot of cigarette butts
and receipts.

40:08.065 --> 40:10.032
Seems the guy was quite
a record-keeper.

40:10.067 --> 40:12.368
I got six guys going
through it all.

40:12.403 --> 40:13.836
Yeah, I don't think
she was talking about receipts.

40:13.871 --> 40:15.338
I think it's something bigger.

40:15.372 --> 40:16.372
Like what?

40:16.406 --> 40:18.841
I don't know.

40:18.875 --> 40:20.276
Well, what did she say?

40:20.311 --> 40:23.513
It wasn't what she said exactly.
It was...

40:23.547 --> 40:25.782
Another one of your hunches?

40:27.184 --> 40:29.219
Just...

40:29.253 --> 40:30.653
I'll keep my eyes open.

40:30.688 --> 40:31.821
Thanks.

40:43.634 --> 40:45.635
I want armed backup here.

40:56.982 --> 40:59.818
So, uh, what is it that
you're looking for exactly?

40:59.852 --> 41:01.019
Something I lent your dad.

41:01.053 --> 41:02.387
Good luck finding it.

41:02.422 --> 41:05.257
Mom says it's like the wreck
of the <i>Hesperus</i> in here,

41:05.291 --> 41:07.860
which I don't really get
what that is.

41:07.894 --> 41:11.831
The <i>Hesperus</i> is a ship that
sank a long time ago, bud.

41:11.865 --> 41:15.001
Some guy, uh, he wrote
a poem about it.

41:15.035 --> 41:17.037
Hey, Chris, do me a favor.

41:17.071 --> 41:19.039
Go into the kitchen

(door opens)

44:32.901 --> 44:34.868
Mike, what brings you here?

44:34.903 --> 44:36.203
CHRIS:
He needed to borrow

44:36.237 --> 44:37.771
something from Dad.

44:37.806 --> 44:39.807
Right.

44:43.244 --> 44:44.878
Could I talk to you a second?

44:53.720 --> 44:55.721
What is it?

44:59.959 --> 45:02.127
You know I care
about you, right?

45:02.162 --> 45:04.129
Of course.

45:04.164 --> 45:05.997
No, not of course.

45:06.032 --> 45:07.832
I mean, I care about you,

45:07.867 --> 45:10.769
and I'm not sure
I should tell you this,

45:10.803 --> 45:12.738
but I think you need to know.

45:12.772 --> 45:15.173
What? What is it?

45:18.010 --> 45:19.977
When Lauder came over
here the other day,

45:20.012 --> 45:21.345
making accusations
about Brody...

45:21.380 --> 45:22.346
He was drunk.

45:22.380 --> 45:24.348
Drunk, yeah, but not wrong.

45:24.382 --> 45:25.916
See, I've been looking
into some stuff

45:25.950 --> 45:27.083
the past couple weeks.

45:27.118 --> 45:29.019
What stuff?

45:29.053 --> 45:31.388
Who killed Tom Walker.

45:33.524 --> 45:35.492
It was Brody, Jess.

45:41.731 --> 45:43.698
No.

45:43.732 --> 45:45.266
Yes, it was.
I just checked

45:45.300 --> 45:47.168
his ammunition in the garage.

45:47.202 --> 45:49.870
I know this is hard to hear;
it's hard to say.

45:49.904 --> 45:51.571
He hasn't been okay
since he got back,

45:51.606 --> 45:53.806
and I'm worried about
you, about the kids

45:53.841 --> 45:56.809
because I love you, and
he's not getting better.

45:56.844 --> 45:59.612
I know.

45:59.646 --> 46:02.214
I know he's not who he was.

46:04.417 --> 46:06.385
(softly):
But he's working for the CIA.

46:06.419 --> 46:08.720
What?

46:08.755 --> 46:10.722
He told me, Mike.

46:10.756 --> 46:12.323
He swore it was the truth.

46:12.358 --> 46:14.258
Okay, it's, it's
not that simple.

46:14.293 --> 46:17.028
Whatever he said-- there's got
to be some kind of a cover-up.

46:19.265 --> 46:21.232
I-I really think
you should go.

46:21.266 --> 46:22.900
I'm just trying
to look out for you.

46:22.935 --> 46:26.037
I know... but don't.

46:26.072 --> 46:28.540
Please.

46:28.574 --> 46:30.843
We're doing the best
we can here.

46:30.877 --> 46:33.946
Just go.

46:37.718 --> 46:39.685
(explosions and grunting
on television)

46:51.264 --> 46:52.565
(door opens)

46:52.599 --> 46:53.866
(door closes)

47:03.911 --> 47:04.944
I need a minute
with the congressman.

47:04.979 --> 47:06.212
Wait. Who are you?

47:06.247 --> 47:08.649
I'm a constituent with
some urgent business.

47:08.683 --> 47:11.018
Sir.

47:11.052 --> 47:12.052
It's okay.

47:12.086 --> 47:15.054
You should go home, Betsy.
It's late.

47:18.459 --> 47:20.693
Did you know?

47:20.728 --> 47:21.728
What?

47:21.762 --> 47:23.096
Did you know?

47:23.130 --> 47:24.964
Know what?
What are you talking about?

47:24.999 --> 47:26.633
I have got seven casualties
in Gettysburg.

47:26.667 --> 47:28.368
Slow down.

47:28.402 --> 47:29.536
Did you know
that was going to happen?

47:29.570 --> 47:30.570
How could I have?

47:30.604 --> 47:32.205
Just answer the question!

47:32.239 --> 47:33.907
Have you been lying

47:33.941 --> 47:35.141
to me?

47:36.510 --> 47:38.211
When you talked to Roya...

47:38.246 --> 47:39.713
- You made me do that.
- ...you told her something.

47:39.747 --> 47:41.014
- You must have.
- No.

47:41.048 --> 47:42.549
Don't you lie to me!

47:42.583 --> 47:44.817
- Carrie.
- Don't you touch me. Don't you

47:44.852 --> 47:45.818
fucking dare!

47:45.853 --> 47:48.788
I didn't lie to you.

47:48.822 --> 47:51.424
I don't know anything
about any of that.

47:53.493 --> 47:56.262
I don't know what you're saying.

48:03.337 --> 48:05.806
Really.

48:09.110 --> 48:11.378
Shh.

48:11.412 --> 48:12.712
Hey.
(sobbing)

48:16.750 --> 48:18.719
Hey.

48:21.288 --> 48:23.256
Shh.

48:25.126 --> 48:27.894
(sobbing)
