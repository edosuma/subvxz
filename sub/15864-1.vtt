00:29.112 --> 00:33.784
You are a disaster! A shame!
Without any professional ethos,

00:34.034 --> 00:37.538
your big nose can not take
things from strangers!

00:37.621 --> 00:40.290
As an intergalactic
observer you are useless!

00:40.374 --> 00:43.460
Did anyone else see these
letters flying around?

00:43.544 --> 00:45.462
You are hopeless, Kazoo!

00:45.796 --> 00:47.714
Actually, I heal Ga-zoo.

00:47.965 --> 00:49.883
Ga. Let's say it all together.

00:49.967 --> 00:50.884
Quiet!

00:50.968 --> 00:55.305
You fly to a planet without any
civilization that you could ruin.

00:55.389 --> 00:56.890
You're welcome!  Only not...

00:56.974 --> 00:58.058
The earth!

00:59.142 --> 01:03.730
You should document the bizarre mating
behavior of earthlings, love and marriage.

01:03.814 --> 01:06.692
Why can not they
reproduce like us?

01:10.988 --> 01:13.323
It's a boy!

01:15.325 --> 01:17.327
And so green and slimy.

01:17.661 --> 01:19.371
H6r rumzuschleimen!

01:19.830 --> 01:20.831
Wait.

01:20.914 --> 01:23.500
There are certainly others
who are more qualified.

01:23.584 --> 01:26.211
Naturally.
But why do you risk it?

01:27.671 --> 01:28.964
Not the earth!

01:29.756 --> 01:32.259
<i>You have not ma!  Pants invented!</i>

01:32.509 --> 01:34.469
Did you see my legs?

01:34.678 --> 01:39.349
Imagine the idiot Kazoo
is hanging out with!

02:11.465 --> 02:12.716
BRONTOKRAN SCHOOL

02:12.799 --> 02:14.468
It's an exciting time, Barney.

02:14.551 --> 02:18.972
Sure, Fred. No work, no money, no women.
It really goes up.

02:21.058 --> 02:25.395
Do not worry. Everything will be different
when we pass our final exam tomorrow.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.482
I know how to turn that thing.

02:28.565 --> 02:31.985
All the other guys will
be betting all night.

02:32.235 --> 02:35.238
Do not interrupt!
When they finally go to sleep,

02:35.322 --> 02:38.158
the whole stuff falls
out of their heads again.

02:38.241 --> 02:40.786
Not with me.
Be ahead of those around L'a'ngen.

02:41.078 --> 02:45.415
I will not cramming tonight.
I'll sleep well, get up early,

02:45.666 --> 02:47.209
and learn early in the morning.

02:47.292 --> 02:52.297
That way everything is in my
pear when it comes to testing.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.591
- There's only one thing.
- What?

02:54.675 --> 02:56.301
The test is today.

02:57.594 --> 02:58.762
Today!

03:01.431 --> 03:02.599
Flint!

03:03.850 --> 03:05.268
You are the next!

03:05.352 --> 03:09.106
<i>Néichster on Bronto Simulator No.

Come on!

03:22.411 --> 03:23.495
10 POINTS

03:25.080 --> 03:28.542
Were you able to control a
Bronto crane with miscarriages?

03:29.126 --> 03:32.629
If you have trouble with the
crane, just get Barney ran.

03:38.135 --> 03:41.471
Oh, I have such a stomachache!

SERVICES OF MECHANIC

03:46.977 --> 03:48.145
Here we go.

03:50.814 --> 03:52.232
You want to.

04:02.826 --> 04:05.328
Watch out!  She starts!

04:11.668 --> 04:15.922
Hey, I have three mégenes.
Have some sympathy for me!

04:17.716 --> 04:18.925
5 POINTS

04:25.515 --> 04:26.850
Time!

04:31.271 --> 04:32.439
How was I?

04:33.273 --> 04:35.108
Well, flint,

04:37.360 --> 04:39.029
you have passed!

04:44.743 --> 04:46.953
Heartfelt congratulations

04:47.370 --> 04:49.372
Frederick Flintstone!

04:50.207 --> 04:51.875
Let's go, Fred!

04:53.543 --> 04:56.129
- Congratulations, Frederick.
- Thanks.

04:58.423 --> 05:00.217
Melvin Granite!

05:03.637 --> 05:04.846
Thank you very much.

05:13.730 --> 05:18.735
Gifts! I have the best bridal
shower a girl could want.

05:19.069 --> 05:21.238
And this is from Wilma.

05:25.575 --> 05:28.537
A vacuum cleaner.  Thanks alot.

05:29.079 --> 05:31.581
As if she would do housework, huh?

05:31.665 --> 05:34.292
I give this marriage six
months, at most.

05:35.919 --> 05:37.170
W0 is Wilma?

05:46.763 --> 05:49.349
This girl brings me to the grave.

05:52.769 --> 05:57.774
Wilma Slaghoople!
Starrst again this tar pit Bedrock!

05:58.108 --> 06:02.362
There's nothing wetter down there than a horde
of flat-footed, egg-headed Neanderthals,

06:02.445 --> 06:04.865
who pry each other and grunt.

06:06.241 --> 06:09.202
It is said that they were
still afraid of fire.

06:09.286 --> 06:12.038
I think they are just like you and me.

06:13.373 --> 06:14.875
That's all my fault.

06:14.958 --> 06:17.961
I let you play with
the servants' children.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.213
Little, please.

06:20.297 --> 06:24.885
Come down and at least pretend to
amuse yourself like everyone else.

06:25.135 --> 06:26.136
Come over.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.809
See, potholders!

06:34.728 --> 06:36.563
Were these all gifts?

06:37.647 --> 06:39.232
What do we do now?

06:39.983 --> 06:41.151
My ladies,

06:41.818 --> 06:43.653
I have an idea.

06:44.154 --> 06:46.489
How about a little excursion?

06:46.740 --> 06:47.908
To the club?

06:48.158 --> 06:50.869
Actually,
I thought of something else,

06:50.952 --> 06:54.456
a little change.  Something new.

06:55.165 --> 06:57.834
How about Bedrock...

06:58.335 --> 07:00.170
to bowling?

07:08.011 --> 07:09.679
Is not she the best?

07:09.763 --> 07:11.139
Oh, yes, she is.

07:22.067 --> 07:23.485
My Wilma,

07:23.610 --> 07:27.155
beautiful and witty.
A price for a man.

07:28.198 --> 07:31.201
Hello, chip.  What are you doing here?

07:31.701 --> 07:35.288
I have to discuss business
with Colonel Slaghoople.

07:35.372 --> 07:38.500
There is a girl I would
like to invest in.

07:42.212 --> 07:43.630
Hello ladies.

07:45.924 --> 07:49.678
I guess the next bridal
party will be Wilma's.

07:53.974 --> 07:58.186
Well, ladies, you do not
need to call invitations yet.

08:00.271 --> 08:02.524
Have him on the hook.  Pull him ashore.

08:02.691 --> 08:07.404
If I could get a chip,
I'd blame Eugene on the Raptors.

08:07.737 --> 08:09.406
Wilma, get together.

08:09.489 --> 08:13.493
Chip Rockefeller was
the best in Princestone!

08:13.910 --> 08:16.913
And he owns half Rock Vegas.

08:17.247 --> 08:18.415
Colonel.

08:19.082 --> 08:21.584
You and Chip are made for each other.

08:21.918 --> 08:24.379
<i>Think of the life he can offer div.</i>

08:24.462 --> 08:27.257
We will go shopping
together every day...

08:27.340 --> 08:29.300
- play tennis...
- cosmetics...

08:29.592 --> 08:34.597
Pull over our men!
Just like our mother.

08:52.949 --> 08:56.286
W0 were you?
l was looking for you everywhere.

08:56.953 --> 08:59.289
I did not feel like partying.

08:59.539 --> 09:00.874
Are you kidding?

09:01.124 --> 09:05.003
We will work in a quarry
for the rest of our lives!

09:05.795 --> 09:08.381
Who says that
dreams are not true?

09:09.299 --> 09:11.551
I think, I should be happy, but...

09:11.634 --> 09:16.306
I always thought that I would
share this success with someone.

09:16.639 --> 09:18.975
Well, Fred, I'm always there for you.

09:20.143 --> 09:23.480
<i>Thanks, Barney, abet date is not possible.</i>

09:25.648 --> 09:26.816
Yes.

09:27.567 --> 09:28.902
I know.

09:29.819 --> 09:32.072
- What are you talking about?
- A girl!

09:32.155 --> 09:34.991
Right.  That's what I thought.

09:35.658 --> 09:38.578
Do not worry, Fred.
It will be OK.

09:38.661 --> 09:43.166
How does it always heal: "It
happens when you least expect it."

09:43.500 --> 09:46.169
Well, you're wrong, Barney.

09:46.503 --> 09:50.090
I believe that one has to
work out his chances in life.

09:50.173 --> 09:53.176
You have to go and
take things in hand.

09:53.510 --> 09:56.054
It's not like anything
is falling from the sky,

09:56.137 --> 09:58.765
lands in front of you and
changes your whole life.

10:20.537 --> 10:22.205
What was that?

10:35.885 --> 10:37.971
<i>Help!  Is there anyone draining?</i>

10:40.807 --> 10:42.976
I think there's someone in there.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.395
Come on, let's try to open it.

10:45.478 --> 10:47.313
I'm behind you, buddy.

11:12.422 --> 11:14.841
I'm not, Barney.  Looks empty.

11:15.425 --> 11:18.261
Would you please not
touch me by the antenna?

11:18.344 --> 11:21.264
It is not a very pleasant feeling.

11:22.682 --> 11:25.351
- Get me out of here!
- Come on, buddy!

11:36.946 --> 11:40.783
- What are you?
- I'm the Great Gazoo.

11:41.451 --> 11:43.119
The Great Kazoo?

11:43.453 --> 11:44.954
Ga zoo.

11:45.288 --> 11:48.124
My planet is too far away
for you to understand

11:48.208 --> 11:51.544
and develop my culture
as a way of capturing it.

11:51.794 --> 11:54.964
Hold on, Fred.
I bet we have a wish!

11:55.048 --> 11:56.049
I beg your pardon?

11:56.132 --> 11:59.135
We free you from the
bottle, so a wish.

11:59.427 --> 12:02.555
Barney is right. Let's get started.
What do we have to rub?

12:02.805 --> 12:06.142
Listen to me.
I'm not just some cute cartoonist.

12:06.226 --> 12:09.145
And this is not a
bottle, but a spaceship.

12:09.312 --> 12:12.232
I belong to a
sophisticated species.

12:12.482 --> 12:15.985
I do not make weird sounds,
I do not sing ditties...

12:16.236 --> 12:20.490
and I do not have a magic carpet
with your big butts flying around!

12:20.823 --> 12:25.578
I am here to observe the mating
behavior of your species. Sure, dummies?

12:25.828 --> 12:26.913
"Dummies"?

12:27.163 --> 12:28.915
Was that an insult?

12:29.082 --> 12:30.667
Well, if it is true...

12:30.750 --> 12:32.168
What is true?

12:32.418 --> 12:33.920
It was an insult.

12:34.003 --> 12:35.713
I was thinking the same thing.

12:36.422 --> 12:38.341
You are here as an observer.

12:38.675 --> 12:42.178
Well, watch as your teeth
fly out of your head.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.056
There he is, Fred.

12:47.767 --> 12:51.062
Violent natives!
Will break tourism.

12:52.939 --> 12:56.276
Maybe you satisfy my
intellectual curiosity.

12:56.442 --> 12:57.777
Fine, and you?

12:58.027 --> 12:58.945

beware, the waiters are too.

13:36.232 --> 13:37.817
What do you like to have?

13:38.067 --> 13:39.569
What I would like to have?

13:44.157 --> 13:46.242
How much does a glass of water cost?

13:46.409 --> 13:47.952
Water?  Is free.

13:48.077 --> 13:49.912
Great, I'll take two.

13:53.249 --> 13:55.335
Do you want a burger to the water?

13:55.418 --> 13:57.754
Water is enough for me.  I like water.

13:58.087 --> 14:02.258
If you have no money,
I can interpret you.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.677
They go home,
collect money and give it back.

14:04.761 --> 14:07.764
No.  That is impossible.  I can not.

14:08.264 --> 14:10.266
I can not go home...

14:10.600 --> 14:14.270
Uh-oh!  Are you helpless?

14:14.937 --> 14:17.106
But you are so clean!

14:17.440 --> 14:18.858
No, look...

14:19.025 --> 14:21.194
You poor, poor thing.

14:21.444 --> 14:25.031
Did I just call you poor!
Sometimes I am thoughtless.

14:25.448 --> 14:28.826
- You are not poor. You are not.
- No I'm not.

14:28.951 --> 14:30.953
You're just unlucky, right?

14:31.037 --> 14:32.955
Do not worry.

14:33.206 --> 14:35.333
You stay with me until it works again.

14:35.416 --> 14:37.710
And I'll give you a lunch.

14:37.794 --> 14:40.505
But not!
That's nice of you, but...

14:40.630 --> 14:44.300
You're welcome. I have worked
voluntarily at the Héhlenlosenhilfe.

14:44.634 --> 14:45.968
And I see

14:46.302 --> 14:48.638
that you are not looking for donations.

14:48.971 --> 14:51.224
You are looking for your self-esteem!

14:57.313 --> 15:01.150
Good, Wilma.
Let's get you something to eat.

15:01.484 --> 15:03.986
Then we put you down
in my apartment.

15:04.070 --> 15:05.905
You live in an apartment?

15:06.406 --> 15:11.327
GrolSartig! I've always wondered what
it's like to live in an apartment.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.998
Life can be so cruel.

15:20.711 --> 15:23.256

Good night, Fred.

Good night, Barney.

Good night, dummies!

15:40.356 --> 15:41.858
Look, this kazoo.

15:46.362 --> 15:47.780
<i>What are you doing New '?</i>

15:48.030 --> 15:52.201

aufgehfs!

15:55.371 --> 15:57.707
Barney and I do not mate...

15:59.375 --> 16:01.043
Get down from me.

16:02.211 --> 16:05.882
Horr, buddy. You still have
to learn how this works here.

16:06.048 --> 16:08.468
So who or what do you pair with?

16:08.718 --> 16:09.844
Maid!

16:09.927 --> 16:11.637
W0 are these "girls"?

16:13.389 --> 16:15.391
I ask myself the same thing.

16:57.183 --> 16:58.392
I have it!

16:59.769 --> 17:01.687
Did you hurt yourself, Wilma?

17:01.771 --> 17:03.105
Who is Wilma?

17:20.915 --> 17:23.416
Finally, some hormonal activity.

17:23.792 --> 17:28.130
All right, guys, start time.
I'm not paid on an hourly basis.

17:28.214 --> 17:29.799
Shut up, Gazoo.

17:29.882 --> 17:34.136

You must not inhibit our style.

There is no right to shout about it.

17:57.660 --> 17:59.662
I talk to him, not to you.

17:59.745 --> 18:01.080
With who?  lhm?

18:01.330 --> 18:04.166
The little green guy.  Do you see him?

18:05.835 --> 18:08.421
Wait a moment.  He thought I had...

18:09.839 --> 18:11.173
Wait a moment.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.510
Are we the only ones
who can see you?

18:14.594 --> 18:19.515
Right. Maybe a 200-point
question on "prehistoric feuds"?

18:19.849 --> 18:24.520
We talked to you all day and
people thought we were two...

18:24.770 --> 18:25.855
Dummies?

18:30.026 --> 18:34.196
I tell you, I have a good feeling.
Today could be my day.

18:34.530 --> 18:39.452
Who? I could turn around
now and meet my dream girl.

18:40.703 --> 18:42.872
What's up, boys?

18:44.040 --> 18:47.376
Attention, Barney.
You will never want to be alone again.

18:55.801 --> 18:57.970
I'm sorry, no changes.

18:58.220 --> 19:01.057
<i>No, I, wit...</i>

19:05.144 --> 19:07.313
You want to make an appointment with me?

19:09.690 --> 19:12.568
I already had men who said less.

19:12.902 --> 19:14.236
Why not?

19:14.487 --> 19:16.906
We can go to the
fairground tomorrow.

19:30.920 --> 19:33.547
Does your little friend
want a rendezvous?

19:35.841 --> 19:37.760
Help!

19:41.764 --> 19:43.933
I have the perfect girl.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.476
I'll be right back.

19:46.102 --> 19:48.938
Barney, we'll take a shower today.

20:14.130 --> 20:16.549
I do not want to know anything
about your mating rituals,

20:16.632 --> 20:19.969
but I dare say that
this can not be good.

20:34.483 --> 20:37.570
See the 40-year-old man,
a wonder of nature!

20:37.820 --> 20:41.824
Step closer!
For only one shell you are in!

20:47.663 --> 20:52.001
That is amazing! I can not believe it!
It is so loud.

20:52.334 --> 20:53.586
I noticed.

20:53.669 --> 20:56.839
That looks like bowling!
Barney, are we bowling?

20:57.173 --> 21:01.510
Clear. But Fred and I
go bowling all the time.

21:02.344 --> 21:03.929
That's a pretty idea.

21:05.639 --> 21:09.101
Who pays to see dinosaurs?
I have them in the backyard!

21:17.359 --> 21:19.361
You have a big-hearted laugh.

21:20.362 --> 21:21.530
Yes.

21:21.864 --> 21:23.532
You also.

21:30.748 --> 21:32.374
<i>Mags 'you bronto rollercoasters'?</i>

21:32.458 --> 21:35.169
- I'm faster there.
- We will see.

21:57.399 --> 21:59.902
This is going to be a big deal, right?

22:04.156 --> 22:06.200
So, what do you want to do first?

22:09.245 --> 22:10.579
How do you heal again?

22:16.252 --> 22:18.087
Come on, Hiibscher!

22:21.757 --> 22:23.592
SWEET ROCK

22:25.928 --> 22:27.012
Watch out.

22:30.099 --> 22:32.268
hoop-la

22:32.852 --> 22:36.939
Just try it, Schickse.
You would not even meet a brontosaurus!

22:46.615 --> 22:48.617
That was a good throw.

22:48.951 --> 22:50.119
Or not?

22:50.286 --> 22:53.122
That's pretty hard to clear

22:53.789 --> 22:55.457
for most people.

23:06.302 --> 23:07.970
We have a winner.

23:12.141 --> 23:15.227
These things never last
longer than a week.

23:15.477 --> 23:19.315
Fred, do you think you could
teach me how to bowl like you?

23:19.899 --> 23:22.401
For sure.  Let's see what you have on it.

23:23.277 --> 23:24.486
Well.

23:34.830 --> 23:35.915
Done.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.500
Let me help you.

23:39.168 --> 23:40.669
Give me your hand.

23:41.337 --> 23:43.005
The middle fingers.

23:44.840 --> 23:46.508
Balance it out.

23:53.849 --> 23:55.851
And now relax.

23:58.354 --> 24:00.356
Everything is in the toe.

24:27.216 --> 24:28.717
I did it!

24:35.891 --> 24:37.059
Hey, Fred!

24:41.563 --> 24:44.900
Look, I ran away with Betty,

24:45.234 --> 24:47.736
where I had an appointment with Wilma.

24:48.237 --> 24:51.448
I wonder if it would be
a problem for you if...

24:51.740 --> 24:53.075
<i>WED "...</i>

24:53.575 --> 24:55.995
What do you think?

24:56.578 --> 24:59.289
Do you mind leaving me to Betty?

25:00.207 --> 25:02.751
Not in the least, dude.
Take the car.

25:02.835 --> 25:07.381
Thank you bro. She wants to come
with us and make me breakfast.

25:09.466 --> 25:13.262
Do not know what's going to
happen, but I can not refuse food.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.359
It's pretty cool right now.

25:27.443 --> 25:31.780
Cool? Are you kidding?
The earth is still pretty warm!

25:33.198 --> 25:37.536
I wish I had taken
something to change.

25:42.666 --> 25:44.001
Thanks.

25:45.044 --> 25:50.049
Nice start. Now get it right so I
can get away from this barren rock.

25:50.299 --> 25:52.342
You are not here for me.

25:52.801 --> 25:54.303
What did you say?

25:56.638 --> 25:58.307
I said, for me...

25:58.640 --> 26:00.392
are you the only one here?

26:02.811 --> 26:04.104
That's so cute.

26:05.397 --> 26:07.357
Come on, go ahead!

26:07.483 --> 26:09.318
You are in the finish area.

26:11.487 --> 26:13.489
"Is not it romantic?

26:13.822 --> 26:15.824
"Come on, kiss her, Dum..."

26:19.995 --> 26:23.332
Your eyes are like two big eyes.

26:43.018 --> 26:45.938
He is so cute.
He thinks you are his mother.

26:46.021 --> 26:47.856
Ru nter, boy.  Ru nter!

26:59.201 --> 27:01.203
I lead a simple life.

27:01.703 --> 27:04.706
If I have a roof over my
head, eat on the table...

27:04.790 --> 27:07.793
and a sharp
grid-shell, I'm happy.

27:08.877 --> 27:13.215
You're so different from
the guys I grew up with.

27:13.715 --> 27:16.885
- Really, how are they?
- Just very different.

27:20.806 --> 27:22.307
Here it is.

27:27.187 --> 27:29.857
I had a great evening today.

27:31.900 --> 27:33.902
I hope you too.

27:35.070 --> 27:37.072
I would not change anything.

27:41.451 --> 27:42.619
Good night.

27:44.663 --> 27:45.831
Good night.

29:21.176 --> 29:24.263
FAST DRIVE GARDENING
RESERVATIONS NOW

29:33.105 --> 29:34.189
FLINT

30:06.888 --> 30:09.808
Good morning, Fred.
What a wonderful morning!

30:09.891 --> 30:14.229
I was thinking exactly the same
thing, Barney. Wonderful!

30:15.939 --> 30:17.816
I guess your evening was nice?

30:17.899 --> 30:20.068
Are you kidding?

30:20.402 --> 30:24.740
I never met anyone like her.
This Wilma could be the right one.

30:24.823 --> 30:26.825
I think the same about Betty.

30:26.908 --> 30:28.076
She is clever.

30:28.160 --> 30:29.244
It is healing.

30:29.328 --> 30:30.662
- Kind. - Funny.

30:30.912 --> 30:32.164
She has class.

30:32.247 --> 30:33.749
It is healing.

30:34.416 --> 30:36.752
Wunderschén!

30:42.090 --> 30:45.552
Because you, Wilma,
you should really put your hair up.

30:45.927 --> 30:47.554
As if I were too small!

30:48.889 --> 30:50.140
Look.

30:52.100 --> 30:54.936
Look, it emphasizes your smile more.

30:57.439 --> 31:01.109
I think I have a lot
more to laugh these days.

31:01.360 --> 31:03.737
And I owe it all to you, Betty.

31:03.945 --> 31:06.531
The first real friend I ever had.

31:06.615 --> 31:10.035
You had a hard life.
You deserve a few breaks.

31:10.786 --> 31:14.122
Actually, Betty, it was not that hard.

31:17.959 --> 31:21.546
Because you, there's something
I wanted to tell you,

31:21.671 --> 31:24.299
I was scared,
but I think, now...

31:24.383 --> 31:25.801
The pizza is here.

31:29.805 --> 31:32.974
Good evening.  I'm looking for...

31:33.475 --> 31:34.476
Mother?

31:35.727 --> 31:38.063
Wilma?  Are you that?

31:38.313 --> 31:40.816
What kind of place is that?

31:41.316 --> 31:44.986
This is an apartment.
Many people live like this.

31:46.446 --> 31:48.407
That does not make it better.

31:48.490 --> 31:53.245
Who are you, the cleaning lady?
They work badly. Dismiss.

31:53.495 --> 31:54.496
Path!

31:54.746 --> 31:59.084
Mother!
This is my new best friend Betty.

31:59.334 --> 32:01.336
She was very good to me.

32:01.670 --> 32:04.172
And I was a normal raven mother.

32:06.007 --> 32:08.760
I will take a bath now.

32:09.344 --> 32:10.679
Lots of fun.

32:11.680 --> 32:12.681
Mother.

32:13.306 --> 32:15.016
How did you find me?

32:15.100 --> 32:18.770
I did what all worried parents
said: I took a detective.

32:18.854 --> 32:19.604
What?

32:19.688 --> 32:21.940
We discuss everything on the way home.

32:22.023 --> 32:23.442
I'm home, mother.

32:23.525 --> 32:26.611
And I am happier
than ever in my life.

32:26.695 --> 32:31.199
You can put me in a sack and haul
home, but I run away again.

32:32.200 --> 32:34.369
Good, Wilma.  Well.

32:34.870 --> 32:37.205
You have broken my heart.

32:37.873 --> 32:43.295
But I will not let you do the
same to your dear, frail dad.

32:43.879 --> 32:46.548
Darling, he misses you so much.

32:46.882 --> 32:50.886
And if you do not appear
on Sunday for his birthday,

32:53.638 --> 32:58.101
then I just can not remember how many
more birthdays he still celebrates...

32:58.643 --> 33:00.103
will be established.

33:09.237 --> 33:12.574
I wonder why Wilma gave us
those suits for the party.

33:12.657 --> 33:14.868
Maybe it's a Kostiimparty.

33:19.956 --> 33:20.874
Seat!

33:21.458 --> 33:22.459
Dino,

33:23.084 --> 33:24.419
Seat.

33:27.756 --> 33:30.759
Come on, let's pick up the Médels.

33:50.070 --> 33:52.239
Well, Barney, what do you think of that?

33:54.491 --> 33:57.077
Oh, Fred,
that would not have been necessary.

33:57.160 --> 33:59.871
Not for you, idiot, but for Wilma!

34:00.789 --> 34:02.874
I will stop for her hand.

34:03.667 --> 34:07.003
Dummi, there seems a little
flake or something...

34:07.254 --> 34:09.464
to stick to your ring.  Exactly there.

34:10.465 --> 34:12.217
That's the stone, Gazoo.

34:14.010 --> 34:15.512
More was not possible.

34:15.594 --> 34:16.846
I'm sorry.

34:17.681 --> 34:21.351
I am sure she will be
impressed by your...

34:21.601 --> 34:22.936
Thrift.

34:23.186 --> 34:25.230
That's the great thing about Wilma.

34:25.313 --> 34:27.315
I do not have to impress her.

34:27.607 --> 34:31.277
She is a simple girl
with a simple taste.

34:37.617 --> 34:41.955
There are some things that I
have not yet managed to tell you.

34:43.956 --> 34:46.793
Welcome to Gut Slaghoople.

34:47.127 --> 34:49.295
Your house has a name?

35:04.978 --> 35:06.229
Fred, look.

35:06.479 --> 35:08.565
A Cadi Roc sedan!

35:14.988 --> 35:17.157
Betty, I'm sorry.

35:17.490 --> 35:19.159
I was so embarrassed.

35:19.492 --> 35:23.580
I should have noticed that a
Héhlenlose not Issac Mizrocki trégt.

35:25.165 --> 35:27.334
Wilma is here!  Everybody!

35:33.089 --> 35:34.257
She has plasticine.

35:34.341 --> 35:36.509
Fred, you have a lucky streak.

35:36.593 --> 35:41.348
That's awful. I can not give her
such a shabby ring. See the house!

35:41.598 --> 35:44.100
A girl like her
is only the best.

35:44.184 --> 35:47.187
She will see the
ring and laugh at me.

35:47.687 --> 35:51.024
Good that it did not work
to give it to her sooner.

35:51.358 --> 35:53.193
Hey, what are you doing?

35:53.526 --> 35:55.612
He tries to steal my car!

35:55.695 --> 35:57.697
No, sir.  I'm the butler!

35:58.031 --> 36:02.869
Sattler? I do not care what you are.
At least you will not take my car!

36:04.120 --> 36:06.289
Barney!  Leave him in peace!

36:06.373 --> 36:09.876
Fred, he is the butler.  He parks the car.

36:10.543 --> 36:12.045
I already knew that.

36:12.879 --> 36:14.381
Come on, Fred.

36:16.216 --> 36:19.260
Park butler.
First cooked food, now that.

36:19.344 --> 36:20.970
What else are you inventing?

36:32.065 --> 36:34.401
Darling, we are here!

36:38.238 --> 36:40.740
Darling, you look good.

36:41.074 --> 36:42.909
Thank you mother.  Hi.

36:44.577 --> 36:46.538
Congratulations, dad.

36:50.333 --> 36:51.835
<i>Followers from the Front '?</i>

36:51.918 --> 36:54.003
Troops moral excellent, Colonel.

36:54.087 --> 36:58.258
Mother, Father, I want to introduce
you to my new friend, Fred.

36:59.426 --> 37:01.428
Cavalry!  In the saddle!

37:01.678 --> 37:03.346
We're back!

37:03.930 --> 37:05.765
Attack!

37:10.770 --> 37:12.021
Very pleased.

37:12.939 --> 37:14.274
Enjoyable.

37:15.275 --> 37:20.280
Wilma, darling, there's someone
who wants to see you again.

37:20.947 --> 37:23.450
Chip, here we are!

37:24.117 --> 37:25.285
Chip is there?

37:25.368 --> 37:28.455
Of course, Chip is here.
He practically belongs to the family.

37:28.538 --> 37:29.456
Chip?

37:29.539 --> 37:31.624
We went out together.  Went.

37:33.626 --> 37:35.962
You look sweeter than ever.

37:37.297 --> 37:39.799
The high-strung hairstyle appeals to me.

37:40.467 --> 37:43.136
I see you have one...

37:43.386 --> 37:44.554
Friend here.

37:44.637 --> 37:47.640
Wilma, look.  The bone men are there.

37:47.974 --> 37:51.936
You have to see Tiffany's new nose.
She is now between her eyes.

37:54.481 --> 37:57.984
We do not know eachother yet.
I'm Chip Rockefeller,

37:58.318 --> 38:00.403
from the Mesozoic Rockefellers.

38:00.820 --> 38:05.658
I am Fred Flintstone from
the Fredozoic Flint Stones.

38:06.743 --> 38:08.661
In which industry are you?

38:08.745 --> 38:12.415
I will spend my time
in the Steinbrfichen.

38:12.665 --> 38:15.168
You have bought slate & Co.!

38:15.502 --> 38:18.004
No, I'm a Bronto crane driver.

38:19.756 --> 38:21.591
Seriously, what are you doing?

38:22.509 --> 38:25.804
I work in the quarry.
I'm a Bronto crane driver.

38:26.846 --> 38:30.183
Is that serious?  How embarrassing for you.

38:30.517 --> 38:33.353
People, Wilmas New works...

38:33.686 --> 38:35.355
in the quarry!

38:37.023 --> 38:39.526
He is a Bronto crane driver!

39:18.231 --> 39:19.566
Hello Betty.

39:22.819 --> 39:25.989
Did I say that this is
a really pretty dress?

39:26.072 --> 39:27.407
Thanks.

39:28.741 --> 39:32.245
Betty, you're not me
anymore, right?

39:32.579 --> 39:33.580
<i>5590?</i>

39:34.163 --> 39:36.416
Just because you pretended to be poor?

39:36.499 --> 39:39.210
And I took you in
and pitied you?

39:42.005 --> 39:44.257
Why should I be bése because of that?

39:54.601 --> 39:56.936
Am you kidding, princess?

39:57.854 --> 39:59.022
Not so right.

39:59.105 --> 40:00.690
This is my girl!

40:00.940 --> 40:04.110
I have a little something
for your birthday.

40:04.444 --> 40:06.362
But dad, it's your birthday.

40:06.446 --> 40:08.281
Oh yes?

40:08.406 --> 40:10.909
Well, they are not here for me.

40:14.037 --> 40:16.539
They are beautiful.

40:18.291 --> 40:20.168
Yes, you do not like the fancy

40:20.251 --> 40:23.421
but these belong to your
great-great-grandmother.

40:23.630 --> 40:26.257
Actually,
they even came out of their shell.

40:31.804 --> 40:33.806
Whatever you decide for,

40:33.890 --> 40:35.975
I want you to know one thing.

40:36.643 --> 40:39.062
Your daddy will always like you.

40:40.730 --> 40:42.148
Thanks, dad.

40:55.995 --> 40:58.498
These are undoubtedly beautiful pearls.

40:58.831 --> 41:00.166
Thanks, Fred.

41:00.500 --> 41:02.543
They look very expensive.

41:09.175 --> 41:10.885
Ladies and gentlemen!

41:11.594 --> 41:13.930
I would like to bring out a toast.

41:15.306 --> 41:17.266
On the Colonel's birthday.

41:17.350 --> 41:19.769
Although a man of
wealth and influence,

41:19.852 --> 41:24.565
He has the noblest things a man
can wish for. A loving wife...

41:24.941 --> 41:28.528
and the fairest daughter
the world has ever seen.

41:30.029 --> 41:31.698
To the colonel!

41:42.375 --> 41:45.294
You know,
I want to make a toast.

41:45.378 --> 41:46.629
Does it have to be that way?

41:50.550 --> 41:52.719
On Mr. Slaghoople...

41:53.052 --> 41:54.721
Colonel Slaghoople!

41:54.971 --> 41:55.972
Yes?

41:56.222 --> 41:57.682
Mrs. Slaghoople...

41:59.142 --> 42:01.644
and especially Wilma.

42:07.233 --> 42:08.943
Thank you for the invitation.

42:09.736 --> 42:13.489
I have never been in such a big
house without paying admission.

42:16.409 --> 42:19.412
At first I felt a
little uncomfortable,

42:19.662 --> 42:24.000
as you would feel,
come to one of my brotherhood meetings.

42:24.083 --> 42:27.336
The Loyal Order of the Wasserbiiffel.

42:29.756 --> 42:31.090
<i>Waka, waka, wet '?</i>

42:36.596 --> 42:38.598
No no!  Dino, bése!

43:01.954 --> 43:02.997
She!

43:03.081 --> 43:07.710
This is all your fault!
You idiot have ruined my whole party!

43:08.127 --> 43:11.631
You bastard!  You plebs!

43:13.800 --> 43:16.803
Get out.
Get out of my house now!

43:17.136 --> 43:18.805
Watch out, dude.

43:19.055 --> 43:20.556
Aufhéren!

43:23.643 --> 43:25.895
How can you treat people like this?

43:26.145 --> 43:29.232
Is that because they are not like you?
Because you are what?

43:29.649 --> 43:32.527
That's why I like her.
Because they are not like you.

43:34.237 --> 43:37.448
They make me who I
am and not what I am.

43:39.158 --> 43:40.368
I mean...

43:41.994 --> 43:43.663
You know what I mean.

43:43.746 --> 43:46.749
How dare you talk to me like
that, Wilma?

43:46.833 --> 43:50.336
Nobody ever talked like that to me!

43:50.670 --> 43:52.171
Well, mother,

43:52.839 --> 43:55.216
it's about time somebody does it.

43:57.343 --> 43:58.845
Let's go, Fred.

44:01.347 --> 44:03.266
We follow you on the FulSe.

44:03.349 --> 44:05.017
Thanks, Betty.

44:12.859 --> 44:15.111
Wait.  Please do not go.

44:15.862 --> 44:20.867
You were right. He was unforgivable,
how everyone behaved today.

44:21.367 --> 44:22.535
Thanks, Chip.

44:22.618 --> 44:25.538
Good luck, flint.
The better has won.

44:26.706 --> 44:28.583
I am not resentful...

44:28.666 --> 44:32.128
and invite you to my new
casino in Rock Vegas.

44:32.962 --> 44:36.174
Your Turteltéubchen look at everything,
lives in the luxury hotel...

44:36.257 --> 44:39.927
and enjoy the opening concert
with Mick Jagged and the Stones.

44:40.386 --> 44:41.721
The Stones?

44:41.971 --> 44:43.973
"This is not love

44:44.390 --> 44:46.893
"This is destiny"

44:47.226 --> 44:48.477
Well, Wilma?

44:49.228 --> 44:50.813
So, chip,

44:51.063 --> 44:52.899
I, we...

44:53.232 --> 44:56.819
really appreciate that,
but at the moment it is unfavorable...

45:09.832 --> 45:11.417
We would very much like to come.

45:29.393 --> 45:31.479
WELCOME to the
legendary ROCK VEGAS

46:39.505 --> 46:41.007
Let's go, Barney!

47:38.230 --> 47:40.232
Great day, what?

47:40.566 --> 47:42.902
I hope he is never over.

47:48.908 --> 47:50.743
Ah, the young GIuck.

47:51.077 --> 47:53.579
What a pity it will not last.

48:01.420 --> 48:03.422
Just wait, Roxie, darling.

48:03.506 --> 48:07.843
This man is my puppet and I
have barely started playing.

48:07.927 --> 48:12.264
Soon Wilma will see in him the
embarrassingly primitive primate that he is.

48:12.515 --> 48:15.184
I thought with this Wilma it would turn out.

48:15.434 --> 48:17.937
What do I have to do to convince you?

48:18.437 --> 48:21.440
Diamonds?  A maserocki?

48:22.274 --> 48:26.112
Your own show in the stalactite hall?

48:26.612 --> 48:30.116
Pretty nice, chip,
but I prefer cash.

48:30.449 --> 48:33.452
What a coincidence!  We also.

48:34.120 --> 48:37.957
<i>Rocko and Rocko, meme "este Géste.</i>

48:38.040 --> 48:40.501
What can I do for you, gentlemen?

48:40.584 --> 48:44.505
Our boss wants his money.
He says he does not believe you have it.

48:45.131 --> 48:47.967
That's not quite true.

48:48.801 --> 48:50.970
And it is not entirely wrong.

48:51.303 --> 48:53.389
That does not affect him very much.

48:53.472 --> 48:56.642
But he wants his money
until Sunday midnight...

48:56.976 --> 48:59.061
or he takes over your casinos.

48:59.228 --> 49:00.896
And breaks your legs!

49:00.980 --> 49:05.985
That's purely speculative. I will
marry Wilma Slaghoople until Sunday...

49:06.318 --> 49:10.322
and thus one of the largest private
assets in the uncivilized world.

49:10.406 --> 49:11.574
Wish it better for you.

49:11.657 --> 49:14.285
Otherwise you'll beat
the tuna dinosaurs!

49:26.505 --> 49:28.674
Now the action is condensing.

49:44.690 --> 49:46.358
That's heaven.

49:47.234 --> 49:51.280
Please massage between the shoulder blades.
Everything is tense there.

49:51.405 --> 49:55.159
She is tense. I have just
learned what calamari heals.

49:55.701 --> 49:58.537
Wilma, can I ask you something?

49:58.871 --> 50:01.040
Sure, Betty, what is it?

50:01.707 --> 50:04.210
Do you think Barney is serious with me?

50:04.543 --> 50:08.130
What are you talking about?  He is crazy about you.

50:08.380 --> 50:10.049
I hope so.

50:10.382 --> 50:13.969
I've never met anyone like
Bernard Geréllheimer before.

50:14.553 --> 50:17.723
He is so honest and so sUIS.

50:18.057 --> 50:22.269
He makes me feel like I'm the
only girl on this earth disk.

50:22.728 --> 50:25.564
Exactly the feeling gives me Fred too.

50:25.898 --> 50:27.066
At chip...

50:27.900 --> 50:30.152
it was always about money.

50:31.570 --> 50:35.574
There is no trace of greed at Fred.

50:40.412 --> 50:42.665
See all these shells!

50:42.915 --> 50:46.001
Enough to buy Wilma a
ring for each finger.

50:46.085 --> 50:50.339
Maybe a little something for me.
What do you think we should go?

50:50.422 --> 50:54.927
Are you crazy? That's exactly your problem.
You think like a Kleinkrémer.

50:55.261 --> 50:57.429
I will not leave it at a ring.

50:57.513 --> 51:01.517
I buy her a whole lifestyle,
just like Chip Rockefeller.

51:01.767 --> 51:05.604
But she does not want smart, rich,
beautiful types. She wants you!

51:06.021 --> 51:09.358
Pull Leash, hellman!
The man has magic hands.

51:10.859 --> 51:14.655
I know that will not be easy for
you, but let's think about it.

51:14.738 --> 51:19.660
Chip Rockefeller brings you in
his plane to play in his casino.

51:19.994 --> 51:23.956
And with a probability
of 247,000 to 1...

51:24.123 --> 51:26.792
17 times in a row you
made a fool of yourself.

51:26.875 --> 51:28.377
And the solution of the Rétsels?

51:28.460 --> 51:31.880
Clear!  Today is my lucky day!

51:32.965 --> 51:34.466
Good luck, Dummi.

51:34.967 --> 51:36.635
You will need it.

51:37.636 --> 51:39.471
Come on, you little ones.

51:41.807 --> 51:43.809
Seven!

51:45.978 --> 51:48.355
What did I tell you, Barney?  Magical!

51:48.439 --> 51:51.108
That's not magic, it's can be.

51:51.817 --> 51:55.821
A gentleman like you should
play with higher goals.

51:56.155 --> 51:58.157
ONLY HIGH APPLICATIONS

51:58.490 --> 52:02.244
I just got warm, you know,
my cash has improved.

52:02.911 --> 52:05.623
- Cash? I'll lend you credit.
- Credit?

52:05.706 --> 52:10.169
For sure! Our house stretches,
you pay it back. A man with your skills?

52:10.252 --> 52:13.255
It would be an honor for me to
keep a house account for you.

52:15.007 --> 52:18.260
Do not do that. That's how my
uncle, the player, lost everything.

52:18.344 --> 52:21.055
His wife, his house,
the children, the dog...

52:21.513 --> 52:24.099
Have you been to
lss-so-many-you-can-fat?

52:24.183 --> 52:25.392
Fred, please!

52:25.976 --> 52:27.019
"As much as you can"?

52:27.102 --> 52:29.980
Absolutely! I introduce you to
Roxie, the Rockettes.

52:30.064 --> 52:32.816
Roxie, are you showing Mr
Geréllheimer the biifett?

52:33.025 --> 52:36.695
It is a great pleasure for me.

52:37.696 --> 52:42.701
I'll take you to your table and ask the
hall supervisor for a stack of shells.

52:42.826 --> 52:44.078
New launcher!

52:46.288 --> 52:50.209
Look and yell, guys.
Four lovely ladies.

52:51.043 --> 52:53.879
And now it's six.  W0 were you two?

52:54.296 --> 52:57.383
We have been waiting for
you, in the cave club.

52:57.633 --> 53:00.719
I'm sorry, Wilma.
I have a lucky streak!

53:01.053 --> 53:02.721
W0 is Barney?

53:04.014 --> 53:06.725
Has gone with such a
Ténzerin to BUfett.

53:06.809 --> 53:08.018
A doer?

53:15.317 --> 53:19.279
If it heals "as much as you can,"
you do not mean until you burst.

53:19.363 --> 53:21.532
I'm just starting.

53:24.201 --> 53:25.911
How big the cake is!

53:26.120 --> 53:28.497
Waiter!  Here!

53:40.134 --> 53:41.385
I'll help you.

54:02.239 --> 54:05.075
Schétzchen, I love
you, but I have to go.

54:05.743 --> 54:07.411
See you later!

54:15.127 --> 54:16.628
Hello, little one.

54:20.549 --> 54:22.134
Are you...

54:22.801 --> 54:25.137
Yes, Mick Jagged,

54:25.804 --> 54:27.473
at your service.

54:29.641 --> 54:31.643
And who are you?

54:35.898 --> 54:39.234
What does a pretty girl
like you do here alone?

54:40.152 --> 54:41.361
My friend.

54:42.571 --> 54:43.655
He was...

54:43.989 --> 54:47.159
I saw him with another one!

54:48.494 --> 54:50.162
Oh, Schétzchen.

54:50.496 --> 54:51.914
I'll tell you something.

54:52.080 --> 54:56.710
If you were my wife,
I would not touch another. No way!

54:58.837 --> 55:01.840
AulSer, I'm on tour.
Tours do not count.

55:02.007 --> 55:03.842
Here, here, here.

55:04.426 --> 55:05.844
Why do you hear...

55:06.011 --> 55:10.349
Do not cry and smile at Micki?

55:10.682 --> 55:13.018
There, that's better.

55:14.520 --> 55:17.898
You look so lovely when you
read, Betty 0'Shale.

55:19.858 --> 55:21.527
Thanks.

55:22.861 --> 55:25.364
How about we meet the rest of the band?

55:25.614 --> 55:29.284
And then we look for a
quiet little place where...

55:29.535 --> 55:31.703
we can talk.

55:39.294 --> 55:41.296
Dreitausendeinundvierzig...

55:41.547 --> 55:44.383
What's going on down there?

55:46.718 --> 55:49.263
Look!  There's Mick Jagged and the Stones.

55:56.228 --> 55:59.064
And there is Betty.  She is with the band.

55:59.314 --> 56:02.150
What should Betty do to the Stones?

56:03.151 --> 56:05.487
She does not even play an instrument.

56:05.571 --> 56:08.574
Betty, up here!  It's me, Barney!

56:18.166 --> 56:20.002
I'm sorry.

56:22.087 --> 56:24.423
Wait a minute, Betty!  You're welcome!

56:25.257 --> 56:28.594
Fourteen thousand five
hundred-forty-two.

56:28.927 --> 56:31.513
Fifteen thousand five
hundred forty-two.

56:31.972 --> 56:36.894
Fred, let's do something together.
We could go bowling.

56:37.185 --> 56:38.186
Bowling?

56:39.271 --> 56:41.440
Skittling is for the poor.

56:43.609 --> 56:46.695
It seems you and Chip have
more in common than I thought.

56:46.778 --> 56:49.031
Why?  Because we are both winners?

56:50.449 --> 56:53.619
Here, Fred.  Buy a helping hand.

56:54.119 --> 56:56.288
Wilma, wait.

57:05.964 --> 57:08.508
Favorite!  Honey, what's up?

57:12.888 --> 57:14.973
JACKPOT - ONE MILLION MUSSELS

57:20.979 --> 57:23.607
Good, flint.  You lost Wilma.

57:23.732 --> 57:27.194
Now it's time for you
to lose everything else.

57:29.988 --> 57:31.323
WIN

57:32.324 --> 57:34.326
TO LOSE

57:38.664 --> 57:41.500
Make your pick!  Your Einséitze.

57:49.424 --> 57:50.759
One, red!

57:50.842 --> 57:52.678
One red wins!

58:14.866 --> 58:17.119
Hello, Wilma.  Were you going for a walk?

58:17.369 --> 58:18.996
You notice everything, Chip.

58:20.539 --> 58:22.541
Forgive me the fortification.

58:28.797 --> 58:30.298
I am so sorry.

58:31.717 --> 58:34.386
I just think about too much.

58:35.220 --> 58:36.972
I was pretty nervous too.

58:37.055 --> 58:41.059
Opening weekend,
so many guests and now all the thieves.

58:42.144 --> 58:44.312
- Diebstéihle?
- It's nothing, just...

58:45.230 --> 58:48.066
Just to make sure, I wish,

58:48.400 --> 58:51.945
You IielSest me to do these
wonderful pearls in our safe.

58:54.906 --> 58:56.742
Good idea, chip.

58:57.576 --> 58:59.953
- You mean a lot to me.
- I know.

59:19.097 --> 59:20.891
It depends on you.

59:21.266 --> 59:23.435
Get me back in the game.

59:28.190 --> 59:29.524
Mr. Flintstone?

59:29.775 --> 59:33.445
Mr. Rockefeller invites you to accompany
him to the boxing match tonight.

59:33.695 --> 59:36.114
ROUND 122

59:44.623 --> 59:46.625
More credit?  No.

59:46.875 --> 59:48.877
Is not, does not run, does not work.

59:48.960 --> 59:51.129
Do you know how high your guilt is?

59:51.213 --> 59:52.297
Debt?

59:52.798 --> 59:55.467
One million four hundred thousand shells.

59:59.387 --> 01:00:04.059
What a pity if Wilma finds out
what her friend is for a failure.

01:00:04.643 --> 01:00:05.977
Of course...

01:00:06.394 --> 01:00:08.230
she does not have to know.

01:00:08.313 --> 01:00:09.606
Does not she?

01:00:09.815 --> 01:00:12.818
You see,
I knew you were a good person.

01:00:14.236 --> 01:00:15.487
I'm not.

01:00:15.987 --> 01:00:20.200
I said I would not tell her.
Not that you could have them.

01:00:20.492 --> 01:00:25.330
I cancel your debts, flint.
But you have to disappear. Path...

01:00:25.664 --> 01:00:30.168
from town, from Bedrock,
and you never talk to Wilma again.

01:00:31.169 --> 01:00:32.587
Just a moment.

01:00:33.004 --> 01:00:35.674
You have planned this from the beginning!

01:00:36.007 --> 01:00:39.845
Tell me, how do you manage to
get dressed in the morning?

01:00:40.011 --> 01:00:43.765
I usually wear what I sleep in, too.
What do you want?

01:00:43.849 --> 01:00:45.684
Goodbye, flint.

01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:51.022
You will not get away with it!

01:00:58.029 --> 01:01:00.365
Rockefeller!

01:01:02.617 --> 01:01:04.744
I do not care what happens to me,

01:01:04.828 --> 01:01:08.290
but I will not let you
get in touch with Wilma.

01:01:08.498 --> 01:01:11.918
As soon as I find her,
I tell her exactly what's going on.

01:01:12.002 --> 01:01:15.088
Then we'll see how
well your plan works!

01:01:26.391 --> 01:01:29.311
<i>There was a theft.
All guests please in the hall.</i>

01:01:29.394 --> 01:01:31.479
Apparently there was a theft.

01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:36.151
We will have to continue this
conversation later. Right this way.

01:01:55.003 --> 01:01:56.671
Ladies and gentlemen!

01:01:56.922 --> 01:02:01.092
I regret to inform you that
a criminal is among us.

01:02:03.011 --> 01:02:04.846
How old, you said, are you?

01:02:04.930 --> 01:02:06.932
But before I expose him,

01:02:07.265 --> 01:02:10.435
I want to allow him
to admit his mistakes,

01:02:10.518 --> 01:02:14.189
if only as a tiny step
towards her decree.

01:02:15.774 --> 01:02:18.860
I stole all the
towels from my room!

01:02:19.110 --> 01:02:21.613
<i>That is forbidden, abet...</i>

01:02:21.947 --> 01:02:24.616
I carry the underwears
of someone else!

01:02:26.284 --> 01:02:28.245
No, I spoke of a...

01:02:28.453 --> 01:02:32.457
l systematically poisoned the
water supply of the dinosaurs!

01:02:32.958 --> 01:02:36.753
In a few decades,
the entire species will be extinct!

01:02:39.464 --> 01:02:43.635
Well! That leads nowhere.
I was talking about a necklace.

01:02:43.885 --> 01:02:47.222
A valuable necklace has been
stolen from the hotel safe.

01:02:47.305 --> 01:02:51.643
A necklace of a dear
friend, Wilma Slaghoople.

01:02:53.228 --> 01:02:54.729
<i>Meme Peflen '?</i>

01:02:56.481 --> 01:02:58.483
Alright, who was it?

01:02:58.817 --> 01:03:02.028
If you do not step forward,
I will personally...

01:03:02.153 --> 01:03:06.324
l think violence will not be necessary,
flint, because we know exactly

01:03:06.408 --> 01:03:08.410
who stole Wilma's pearls.

01:03:08.493 --> 01:03:11.579
A desperate man who
suffers his gambling debts.

01:03:11.746 --> 01:03:12.914
Scum!

01:03:13.164 --> 01:03:17.335
Does not anyone here care
that the dinosaurs die out?

01:03:22.007 --> 01:03:24.342
Would you please empty your bags?

01:03:25.176 --> 01:03:27.804
Do you think I stole it?
This is...

01:03:27.887 --> 01:03:30.140
Why do you have something to hide?

01:03:30.432 --> 01:03:33.935
Certainly not!  Look for yourself.

01:03:41.526 --> 01:03:44.070
Wait a moment.  I did not steal it.

01:03:44.696 --> 01:03:46.948
Wilma, why should I steal her?

01:03:47.198 --> 01:03:52.037
Do you deny owe more than a
million shells to the casino?

01:03:53.705 --> 01:03:55.206
Fred, is that right?

01:03:57.042 --> 01:03:58.460
<i>Yes, abet...</i>

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:04.549
Wilma, honey, I'm so sorry.

01:04:13.558 --> 01:04:16.394
You can not believe him!
He tricked me!

01:04:16.478 --> 01:04:19.105
Waechter,
bring the man to prison!

01:04:20.732 --> 01:04:22.400
They come with us.

01:04:22.734 --> 01:04:26.488
<i>Wait a minute!</i>

01:04:26.571 --> 01:04:28.531
They all make a big mistake.

01:04:28.615 --> 01:04:32.452
Fred could not have stolen the necklace.
She was in a safe.

01:04:33.411 --> 01:04:36.456
He does not even keep the
combination of his cock locker.

01:04:36.539 --> 01:04:38.875
He has to write her on his hand.

01:04:39.834 --> 01:04:42.837
Well fine!  Now everyone has seen it!

01:04:43.171 --> 01:04:47.008
Crack a safe? He does not even
crack his knuckles without my help.

01:04:47.092 --> 01:04:51.388
Thank you, Mr. Geréllheimer,
for this confession of the Mittéterschaft!

01:04:51.513 --> 01:04:53.181
Never mind.

01:04:53.932 --> 01:04:54.808
What?

01:04:54.933 --> 01:04:56.601
Take them both away!

01:05:01.272 --> 01:05:02.774
I am innocent!

01:05:02.941 --> 01:05:05.610
Back to the game, everybody!

01:05:11.950 --> 01:05:14.119
W0 is my little girl?

01:05:14.452 --> 01:05:16.955
My poor, poor child!

01:05:18.039 --> 01:05:19.040
Perfect.

01:05:19.290 --> 01:05:22.794
Everything will be fine now, my darling.
Marni is here!

01:05:23.128 --> 01:05:24.379
And I go.

01:05:32.554 --> 01:05:36.224
I already talked to Chip.
He is ready to take you back.

01:05:36.307 --> 01:05:39.477
What gives you the right
to interfere in my life?

01:05:39.561 --> 01:05:43.648
I am your mother and I love you.
And Chip loves you.

01:05:43.898 --> 01:05:45.233
Chip loves em.

01:05:45.316 --> 01:05:49.320
And you have money!
A heavenly connection.

01:05:51.573 --> 01:05:54.075
I think he proved his honesty.

01:05:54.159 --> 01:05:56.494
<i>He saved me from this evil monster.</i>

01:05:56.744 --> 01:05:59.581
Fred is not a monster.
They tricked him.

01:05:59.664 --> 01:06:03.001
That, of course, explains everything.

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:06.921
Wilma, listen to me.  Go back to Chip.

01:06:07.005 --> 01:06:08.339
Sorry?

01:06:12.844 --> 01:06:14.179
Favorite,

01:06:14.679 --> 01:06:17.682
do not let Chip escape again.

01:06:18.850 --> 01:06:22.687
I just do not know how much
pain the poor boy can endure.

01:06:23.021 --> 01:06:26.024
I said you have your
money until midnight!

01:06:26.274 --> 01:06:27.942
The boss doubts that.

01:06:28.193 --> 01:06:32.864
Someone whispered to him that you
are not even with the lady anymore.

01:06:33.948 --> 01:06:38.620
I could lose my job tomorrow.
Since you need a nest egg.

01:06:39.537 --> 01:06:43.458
That is ridiculous.
We marry tonight. Honestly.

01:06:44.626 --> 01:06:48.630
Well. Because, if the bride does not show
up, you will have your wedding night...

01:06:48.713 --> 01:06:50.048
spend me!

01:06:59.224 --> 01:07:01.059
Betty is missing me that way.

01:07:01.559 --> 01:07:06.064
Me, Barney. I would do
anything to see Wilma again.

01:07:06.397 --> 01:07:10.318
We will stay with them if
I have not been so blah.

01:07:10.902 --> 01:07:13.321
Well, I could have told you that!

01:07:15.532 --> 01:07:19.410
How good to see you!
You have to help us out, mate!

01:07:19.744 --> 01:07:22.247
"Dude"?  Did I understand that?

01:07:22.747 --> 01:07:26.501
Are not you the Fred Flintstone
who hurt my feelings so much,

01:07:26.584 --> 01:07:30.380
that I spent the rest of the vacation
in front of the TV in the hotel?

01:07:31.005 --> 01:07:33.925
You're right.  I was wrong.

01:07:34.425 --> 01:07:35.426
I...

01:07:36.094 --> 01:07:41.099
I wanted to impress Wilma with money. With
that, I destroyed everything, as always.

01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:43.184
Because you are what I am?

01:07:43.768 --> 01:07:45.603
Nothing but a great...

01:07:47.272 --> 01:07:48.439
Yes?

01:07:50.441 --> 01:07:51.442
Dummi.

01:07:51.776 --> 01:07:53.069
Someone against it?

01:07:53.778 --> 01:07:55.029
Accepted!

01:07:56.281 --> 01:07:58.116
Look.

01:07:58.449 --> 01:08:03.037
Only because you finally understand
what I knew long ago, do not heal,

01:08:03.121 --> 01:08:06.124
that I do not have a
small weakness for you.

01:08:06.624 --> 01:08:09.669
For real?  You bring us out of here?

01:08:10.628 --> 01:08:14.465
Gazoo will get us out of here!

01:08:14.799 --> 01:08:16.551
Do I look like a cavalry?

01:08:16.634 --> 01:08:19.053
Although their
uniforms look smart.

01:08:19.136 --> 01:08:21.639
You know that I
can not interfere.

01:08:21.723 --> 01:08:26.644
I'm just giving you some pointers
that I found helpful to you.

01:08:30.314 --> 01:08:32.567
I did not know you could do that.

01:08:32.649 --> 01:08:35.319
<i>That's purely speculative.
Until Sunday...</i>

01:08:35.486 --> 01:08:39.657
<i>I marry Wilma Slaghoople and
thus one of the biggest...</i>

01:08:39.907 --> 01:08:41.242
Wilma has trouble!

01:08:41.492 --> 01:08:43.161
We have to get out of here!

01:08:43.411 --> 01:08:45.246
You have to help us, Gazoo!

01:08:45.330 --> 01:08:47.497
I wish I could.  For real.

01:08:47.582 --> 01:08:49.667
So you just let it happen?

01:08:49.834 --> 01:08:54.421
I'll sit in the cell while Wilma
goes with the guy to the altar?

01:08:55.256 --> 01:08:57.925
We should be happy together!

01:08:58.176 --> 01:09:00.511
Just like me and Betty.

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:03.848
Please do not.

01:09:04.182 --> 01:09:06.017
No feelings.

01:09:06.350 --> 01:09:10.104
<i>Maine race thrives on icons
without any trace of a geiixkfl</i>

01:09:10.188 --> 01:09:11.981
it does not work happier.

01:09:12.357 --> 01:09:15.818
We will not be happy.
We have no feelings, but...

01:09:18.529 --> 01:09:20.198
That's so sad.

01:09:20.698 --> 01:09:22.200
Someone hug me!

01:09:34.796 --> 01:09:36.339
TEEREX POCKET SCARF ER

01:09:54.732 --> 01:09:55.900
Clean your nose.

01:09:55.983 --> 01:09:58.403
Barney, you fit through the grid!

01:09:58.653 --> 01:10:02.573
Do I do that? I think I
should have tried this sooner.

01:10:04.409 --> 01:10:06.577
Come on.  Get the keys!

01:10:25.513 --> 01:10:27.515
Back to your Kéfig, dwarf!

01:10:40.445 --> 01:10:41.779
Hello Betty.

01:10:43.114 --> 01:10:44.782
Hello, Wilma!

01:10:44.949 --> 01:10:47.076
I'm just coming to say goodbye.

01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:50.204
I heard you're going to
Stonehenge with Mick Jagged.

01:10:51.122 --> 01:10:52.707
I am so excited.

01:10:52.957 --> 01:10:55.460
Chip said you were together again.

01:10:55.793 --> 01:10:58.296
I am so happy for you.

01:10:59.297 --> 01:11:02.800
I'm also happy for you, Betty.

01:11:03.301 --> 01:11:04.469
I...

01:11:05.303 --> 01:11:07.138
was never so happy.

01:11:07.805 --> 01:11:09.474
Neither do I.

01:11:19.650 --> 01:11:22.653
Stop it. You said big girls now.

01:11:22.820 --> 01:11:26.491
Wilma, darling, you're doing the right thing.

01:11:26.741 --> 01:11:31.245
I married the Colonel for the
money and see how happy we are!

01:11:35.958 --> 01:11:38.795
Ah, so we meet again.

01:11:44.175 --> 01:11:46.511
Swear out and find these guys.

01:11:52.975 --> 01:11:56.145
They are looking for us, Barney.
You have Uberall Waechter.

01:11:56.312 --> 01:11:58.481
What will we do, Fred?

01:11:59.482 --> 01:12:01.400
We fight our way free.

01:12:01.484 --> 01:12:02.985
But they are armed!

01:12:03.069 --> 01:12:04.737
This is war, Barney.

01:12:04.987 --> 01:12:07.323
And in war there are always victims.

01:12:07.573 --> 01:12:10.451
You should know how much I
recognize your sacrifice.

01:12:10.535 --> 01:12:12.537
Why am I being sacrificed?

01:12:12.995 --> 01:12:15.331
Because I'll get Wilma back.

01:12:15.581 --> 01:12:19.168
Understand that. Impossible for
Betty Mick Jagged to give up on you.

01:12:19.252 --> 01:12:21.420
So I have more reason to live.

01:12:31.848 --> 01:12:35.184
Come on, Médels! Here we go!
The curtain opens!

01:12:35.518 --> 01:12:37.687
Come out!  You look lovely!

01:12:37.854 --> 01:12:40.356
Come, opening night!  Here we go.

01:12:40.690 --> 01:12:43.276
Do you see, Fred?  That worked perfectly.

01:12:45.027 --> 01:12:47.780
Come on, do not talk.  Be perfect!

01:13:13.556 --> 01:13:15.558
She looks like a man.

01:13:17.894 --> 01:13:20.062
Your sister should dance.

01:13:37.747 --> 01:13:38.956
There they are!

01:13:40.917 --> 01:13:42.335
Let's disappear!

01:13:49.926 --> 01:13:51.385
Get it!

01:13:56.098 --> 01:13:58.601
"This is not love. This is..."

01:13:58.684 --> 01:14:01.938
What do you think, Betty?
Should I stretch my butt out more?

01:14:02.021 --> 01:14:03.564
Does it look so good?

01:14:03.773 --> 01:14:07.193
Or maybe that's too much butt
for the start of the show?

01:14:07.276 --> 01:14:10.571
It's really up to you, Mick.
You are the artist.

01:14:10.696 --> 01:14:14.200
Yes, that's me, Betty.  This is me.

01:14:20.623 --> 01:14:23.125
You really are with Mick Jagged.

01:14:23.209 --> 01:14:25.795
Hope you did not say the one I asked for.

01:14:26.212 --> 01:14:29.173
Well, the shorter of the
two was once my friend.

01:14:29.256 --> 01:14:30.132
What?

01:14:31.133 --> 01:14:35.638
Betty, I understand it,
if you prefer that rock star to me.

01:14:35.972 --> 01:14:38.641
But I'm here to tell you

01:14:39.558 --> 01:14:40.851
I love you.

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:47.191
I think I've never
told you that before.

01:14:48.067 --> 01:14:49.485
Now I have it,

01:14:49.986 --> 01:14:51.320
so live well.

01:14:51.821 --> 01:14:53.823
Barney, wait!

01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:55.950
Do you mean that seriously?

01:14:56.033 --> 01:14:59.453
Of course. l have never felt
this for somebody before.

01:15:00.079 --> 01:15:02.915
What about the dancer
from the restaurant?

01:15:03.165 --> 01:15:05.918
Roxie?  This is Chip Rockefeller's girlfriend.

01:15:06.002 --> 01:15:09.839
She brought me to the fat store so
I would not stop Fred from playing.

01:15:09.922 --> 01:15:14.135
Chip Rockefeller has a girlfriend?
Someone has to say Wilma!

01:15:14.385 --> 01:15:17.722
Do not worry, Betty.
I'll fix it with Rockefeller.

01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:21.767
Can someone tell me what
the hell is going on here?

01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:25.521
That's not fair! I'm supposed to
be on the stage right away...

01:15:25.771 --> 01:15:30.776
and it's ridiculous to
expect me to be so excited!

01:15:31.027 --> 01:15:32.695
I'm sorry, Mick.

01:15:33.029 --> 01:15:36.699
I really had a great time
with you and all, but...

01:15:37.533 --> 01:15:39.702
I love Barney.

01:15:43.664 --> 01:15:45.374
Well, it's the same to me.

01:15:45.875 --> 01:15:49.879
I'm in love too. The first decent
and respectable woman in my life...

01:15:49.962 --> 01:15:53.049
and her Naivitéit
makes me unbelievable.

01:15:53.632 --> 01:15:56.302
Keep your mouth shut
or there is a big lip.

01:15:56.552 --> 01:15:59.180
Although apparently someone
has already done that.

01:16:03.726 --> 01:16:06.729
That's enough!
Nobody takes away my girl!

01:16:06.812 --> 01:16:10.399
Not after all the trouble
of taking her away from him!

01:16:13.903 --> 01:16:15.905
Take this, you foreigner!

01:16:18.074 --> 01:16:20.076
Come on.  Come over.

01:16:20.576 --> 01:16:21.827
She's mine!

01:16:21.911 --> 01:16:23.079
Oh yes?

01:16:26.582 --> 01:16:29.001
Only over my ridiculously thin body.

01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:50.940
I love you.  I have always loved you.

01:16:51.273 --> 01:16:53.859
I will not lose you a second time.

01:16:55.111 --> 01:16:56.362
Marry me.

01:16:57.029 --> 01:16:58.364
This evening.

01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:03.661
You are great.

01:17:05.121 --> 01:17:06.455
But...

01:17:07.289 --> 01:17:10.793
It's just been too
much lately...

01:17:11.127 --> 01:17:14.630
and I need some time to think.

01:17:14.964 --> 01:17:17.633
Wilma, I can not live without you.

01:17:17.967 --> 01:17:20.136
Just say yes.

01:17:20.803 --> 01:17:21.720
Sorry?

01:17:23.806 --> 01:17:25.349
That's OK.

01:17:25.474 --> 01:17:28.811
My ladies and gentlemen,
the fabulous Tardust Hotel...

<i>"This is not love</i>

01:17:58.340 --> 01:18:00.342
<i>"This is destiny</i>

01:18:03.846 --> 01:18:06.182
<i>"Somewhere up there</i>

01:18:06.473 --> 01:18:08.809
<i>"Did you set it that way?</i>

01:18:11.604 --> 01:18:14.607
<i>"Life does not make sense</i>

01:18:14.982 --> 01:18:17.651
<i>"I never knew why</i>

<i>"And this dream is you</i>

<i>"I never never say</i>

<i>"Wherever we go</i>

01:18:52.728 --> 01:18:54.897
<i>"This is not love</i>

01:18:55.397 --> 01:18:57.650
<i>"This is ecstasy</i>

01:19:00.611 --> 01:19:02.780
<i>"I knew somehow</i>

01:19:03.364 --> 01:19:05.699
<i>"That you would come to me</i>

01:19:08.244 --> 01:19:11.580
<i>"Never say Never"</i>

01:19:12.414 --> 01:19:14.583
Wilma, I never wanted to stretch you.

01:19:15.584 --> 01:19:18.671
I did some stupid things.
Many stupid things.

01:19:20.339 --> 01:19:23.008
<i>But Hebe does stupid things.</i>

01:19:24.927 --> 01:19:29.223
I would never forgive myself if
I did not make that last attempt.

01:19:34.103 --> 01:19:35.938
Wilma Slaghoople,

01:19:36.605 --> 01:19:41.193
I can not give you diamonds,
fast cars or nice houses.

01:19:41.610 --> 01:19:42.945
I can.

01:19:43.195 --> 01:19:47.366
All I have is good old Fred
Feuerstein from Bedrock...

01:19:49.868 --> 01:19:51.870
and the love in my heart.

01:19:52.621 --> 01:19:54.081
Hope that's enough.

01:19:55.374 --> 01:19:57.543
- It's enough. - No it is not!

01:19:58.419 --> 01:20:00.087
Wilma, do you want...

01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:06.218
Do you want...

01:20:10.848 --> 01:20:12.683
Do you want...

01:20:14.643 --> 01:20:15.894
<i>Spoke it out!</i>

01:20:16.312 --> 01:20:18.022
Will you marry me?

01:20:20.816 --> 01:20:25.154
This is your last chance!
Stop me or the dinosaurs are dying!

01:20:25.237 --> 01:20:26.447
Shut up!

01:20:29.616 --> 01:20:30.909
I'm waiting.

01:20:34.413 --> 01:20:35.748
Yes!

01:20:58.854 --> 01:21:01.190
"And do you want, Fred Flintstone...

01:21:01.857 --> 01:21:05.694
"Take Wilma Slaghoople to your wife?

01:21:06.028 --> 01:21:09.323
"You love and honor in good
times and in bad times?"

01:21:13.369 --> 01:21:16.663
"Will you, Wilma,
take Frederick for a husband,

01:21:16.747 --> 01:21:19.541
"love and honor him
in good times or bad?"

01:21:19.625 --> 01:21:20.709
I want.

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:28.133
"Then I hereby explain to you, by virtue
of me from the city of Rock Vegas...

01:21:28.217 --> 01:21:30.886
"Transferred office, to husband and wife."

01:21:31.387 --> 01:21:33.722
You may kiss the bride now.

01:21:35.307 --> 01:21:37.851
- Come on, Mrs. Slaghoople.
- W0 am I?

01:21:42.815 --> 01:21:44.441
Gazoo, are you crying about?

01:21:45.067 --> 01:21:47.027
No, of course not, Dummi.

01:21:47.236 --> 01:21:50.572
No, I am only informed
of information!

01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:52.866
Look, I understand...

01:21:52.950 --> 01:21:56.453
your complex mating behavior.
All the feelings.

01:21:57.079 --> 01:21:58.163
All these...

01:21:58.247 --> 01:21:59.581
Love.

01:22:00.749 --> 01:22:03.252
And I came to the conclusion

01:22:03.335 --> 01:22:05.587
I will never meet anyone!

01:22:12.469 --> 01:22:16.890
You're really sUIS, but believe
me, it would never work.

01:22:17.266 --> 01:22:21.728
Ladies and gentlemen,
