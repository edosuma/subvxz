            [barking]

01:05.099 --> 01:06.765
     Hey, sweetie. Come on.

01:07.701 --> 01:09.401
        Come on, darling.

01:09.403 --> 01:12.204
      Yeah, I got good news
      and bad news, honey.

01:12.206 --> 01:13.839
  Somebody wants to adopt you.

01:15.176 --> 01:17.409
            [whining]

01:17.411 --> 01:21.146
          I'm sorry, guys.
          I tried, I really did.

01:21.148 --> 01:23.315
               But he just wants
               one dog, yeah.

01:23.617 --> 01:25.484
            Okay?
            Shall we go see him?

01:25.486 --> 01:27.853
      Say bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

01:28.422 --> 01:31.423
            There you go.
            That's a good puppy.
            There we go.

01:32.093 --> 01:34.726
  [puppy 1] <i> Hey!</i>
  <i> Where you taking my sister?</i>

01:34.728 --> 01:38.363
  -[woman] Okay.
  -[puppy 2] <i> What about Haley?</i>
  <i> I can't leave without her.</i>

01:38.365 --> 01:40.099
           <i> -Haley!</i>
           <i> -Lindsay!</i>

01:40.101 --> 01:41.500
       [woman] Good baby.

01:41.502 --> 01:44.136
      -[puppy whining]
      -Good baby. Come on.

01:44.805 --> 01:49.508
   [Haley] <i> Don't worry.</i>
   <i> I'll break out of this pen</i>
   <i> and find you. I promise.</i>

01:50.478 --> 01:52.444
 <i> What am I supposed to do now?</i>

01:52.446 --> 01:54.847
  <i> Oh, I'm gonna be so lonely.</i>

03:22.469 --> 03:26.838
 Well, you know this,
 but these guys are all rescues.

03:27.641 --> 03:29.274
       I think they know
       they've been given

03:29.276 --> 03:31.510
    a second chance in life,
    don't you?

03:31.512 --> 03:33.212
                     I think so.

03:33.214 --> 03:35.948
    Dogs are so much smarter
    than people think.

03:36.617 --> 03:40.586
     In fact, in my opinion,
     dogs are smarter
    than people, period.

03:40.588 --> 03:42.487
                [laughing]
                I have to agree.

03:43.457 --> 03:44.690
      -So, the real reason
      why I'm here...
      -Yeah.

03:44.692 --> 03:46.525
                ...is that it is

03:46.527 --> 03:48.860
        our one-year anniversary
        with my boyfriend,

03:48.862 --> 03:50.662
    and I wanted a special gift.

03:50.664 --> 03:51.964
Are you still
going out with Mel?

03:51.966 --> 03:53.565
              Mm-hmm. [chuckles]

03:53.567 --> 03:55.701
    Wonderful!
    Wonderful, wonderful.

03:55.703 --> 03:58.837
-Well, he's always wanted a dog,
so, I thought, maybe a puppy?
-Right.

03:58.839 --> 04:00.339
            A puppy?

04:00.874 --> 04:02.274
          Oh.

04:02.810 --> 04:04.710
You know,
this is your lucky day.

04:04.712 --> 04:07.379
I have exactly what you want.

04:07.381 --> 04:08.480
Come here. Look.

04:12.519 --> 04:13.885
        Oh, my goodness!

04:13.887 --> 04:15.621
         -[dog barking]
         -[laughs]

04:16.390 --> 04:17.623
          It's so cute!

04:18.259 --> 04:19.891
Who is this tiny little one?

04:19.892 --> 04:21.026
               So, that's Haley.

04:21.428 --> 04:22.527
         -Aw.
         -That's Haley.

04:22.529 --> 04:23.695
             She's a little sad.

04:23.697 --> 04:25.264
      She lost her sister today.

04:25.266 --> 04:26.632
     -Oh, no. What happened?
     -[whining]

04:26.934 --> 04:28.867
         Oh, not what you think.
         Um...

04:29.470 --> 04:32.404
         Her sister got adopted,
         but she's very lonely.

04:33.007 --> 04:34.473
        And she'll grow.

04:34.475 --> 04:36.508
         Oh, yeah. Yeah.

04:36.510 --> 04:39.778
Aw. Well, Haley,
what do you say?

04:39.780 --> 04:42.614
If I take you home,
you won't be so lonely anymore?
Huh?

04:42.816 --> 04:45.951
   -Oh, my goodness.
   -Perfect! A perfect match!
   [chuckles]

04:46.320 --> 04:48.754
Aw. She's so cute!

04:48.756 --> 04:50.822
         -[dogs barking]
         -Phew.

04:57.731 --> 04:59.831
       [dishes clattering]

05:03.337 --> 05:04.903
     [clattering continues]

05:04.905 --> 05:06.805
Mel, are you sure
you don't need
my help in there?

05:06.807 --> 05:07.906
        [Mel] No. No, no.

05:07.908 --> 05:10.509
  I've got--
  got everything under control.

05:13.314 --> 05:14.463
   You just-- you stay there.

05:14.464 --> 05:15.613
    -[Haley whining] <i> Oh,</i>
    <i> let me out of this box!</i>
    -Hey. Shh.

05:15.616 --> 05:16.882
           [rattling]

05:16.884 --> 05:18.550
All right.
Soon enough, okay?

05:29.997 --> 05:33.632
   -Dinner is served, my lady.
   -Oh, wow.

05:34.401 --> 05:36.902
     -You did all this?
     -Cowboys can cook too.

05:37.538 --> 05:41.340
Just takes the proper planning
and preparation.

05:41.608 --> 05:44.476
      -Hmm.
      -Nothing but the best
      for the best.

05:44.478 --> 05:46.712
         Well, aren't you
         just full of surprises.

05:46.714 --> 05:48.580
[sighs] You have no idea.

05:48.582 --> 05:49.681
                      [chuckles]

05:49.883 --> 05:51.016
        [doorbell rings]

05:51.552 --> 05:53.352
   Were you--
   were you expecting someone?

05:53.887 --> 05:54.986
               No.

06:00.627 --> 06:02.761
      Hello, sir. It's me again.
      I'm so sorry.

06:02.763 --> 06:05.063
            I forgot to deliver
            the mashed potatoes.

06:05.733 --> 06:07.699
     My apologies.
     They were still in the van.

06:08.635 --> 06:10.102
        -Thanks.
        -You're welcome.

06:10.637 --> 06:13.438
      Oh, by the way, sir, uh,
      you forgot to leave a tip.

06:16.910 --> 06:19.644
         So, all that...

06:21.081 --> 06:23.482
    preparation and planning.

06:23.984 --> 06:25.984
          -[Mel sighs]
          -[laughs]

06:26.420 --> 06:29.454
I totally ruined the meat loaf.
It was a disaster.

06:29.456 --> 06:31.390
 -Oh.
 -It would make a good doorstop,

06:31.392 --> 06:34.159
but it wasn't going to be
a good anniversary dinner.

06:34.528 --> 06:36.428
        Hey, come on. It's okay.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.497
   You know that I like takeout.

06:38.499 --> 06:42.567
         Besides, it's not about
         the cuisine.
        It's about the company.

06:43.470 --> 06:45.570
      -Oh, God. I love you.
      -[laughs]

06:47.074 --> 06:48.540
     Yeah, I kinda figured that.

06:50.778 --> 06:52.611
It's me and you
against the world, right?

06:52.613 --> 06:54.179
      I mean, come on. The world
      doesn't stand a chance.

06:54.181 --> 06:55.714
                        [laughs]

06:56.550 --> 07:00.919
             But what if
             it was three of us?

07:02.623 --> 07:03.688
What, you're not--

07:03.690 --> 07:05.824
            [whining]

07:05.826 --> 07:07.526
              Happy anniversary!

07:07.528 --> 07:08.627
 [Haley]
 <i> Pleased to meet you, handsome.</i>

07:08.629 --> 07:09.861
You got me a puppy?

07:09.863 --> 07:11.963
       I did! Her name is Haley.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.498
            -Oh...
            -[laughs]

07:13.500 --> 07:15.967
She's... um...

07:15.969 --> 07:18.570
         Wait, what's wrong?
         I thought that you said
         you wanted a dog.

07:18.572 --> 07:20.906
No, and it's--
[sighs] Yes, but--

07:23.076 --> 07:24.509
    One second.
    [clears throat]

07:24.845 --> 07:27.446
       -Just-- Stay there.
       -Okay.

07:27.448 --> 07:28.613
               Hey, little girl.

07:29.583 --> 07:31.149
           Oh, no, no, no.
           He just ordered that.

07:31.151 --> 07:32.884
   -No, he just ordered that.
   -[Haley] <i> So good.</i>

07:32.886 --> 07:35.554
     You can't do that. Come on.
     [chuckles]

07:35.556 --> 07:36.755
Happy anniversary.

07:36.757 --> 07:38.056
     [giggling] Oh, my goodness.

07:38.058 --> 07:39.591
          -You didn't!
          -Yeah.

07:39.593 --> 07:42.160
  -That is Lindsay. [chuckles]
  -No.

07:42.162 --> 07:45.697
             Let me guess. Aw...
             Animal shelter?

07:45.966 --> 07:47.532
        -Delilah Higgins.
        -[chuckles]

07:47.768 --> 07:49.835
Yeah. Okay, okay.

07:50.671 --> 07:51.803
                 Oh...

07:51.805 --> 07:55.040
      [Haley] <i> I found you.</i>
      <i> I told you I would.</i>

07:55.042 --> 07:57.242
      [Lindsay] <i> Okay, okay.</i>
      <i> Don't make a scene.</i>

07:57.244 --> 07:59.978
  [Haley]
  <i> What are you talking about?</i>
  <i> I make every scene.</i>

07:59.980 --> 08:01.146
 [Lindsay] <i> Catch me if you can!</i>

08:01.148 --> 08:02.247
      Oh, wow.

08:03.183 --> 08:04.549
Two new additions.

08:04.551 --> 08:05.817
Hopefully we didn't bite off

08:05.819 --> 08:06.952
more than we can chew.

08:07.521 --> 08:09.554
               [laughs]
               Speaking of chew,

08:09.556 --> 08:11.189
      looks like one of them
      just found a new chew toy.

08:11.191 --> 08:12.757
 [Lindsay] <i> This smells so good.</i>

08:12.759 --> 08:13.992
       <i> This is mine now.</i>

08:14.194 --> 08:16.728
Hey. Those are
my favorite sweat socks.

08:16.730 --> 08:19.231
          -[chuckles]
          -[Mel sighs]

08:19.233 --> 08:22.234
Well,
let the compromises begin.

08:22.736 --> 08:24.035
Welcome to family life.

08:24.037 --> 08:29.274
  [Haley] <i> Hey, give that back!</i>
  <i> I found it first!</i>

08:29.843 --> 08:30.942
                Well, then...

08:31.979 --> 08:33.511
             we should
             make this official.

08:34.248 --> 08:36.648
    -Oh, my God.
    -[Mel] Jessica Reynolds?

08:39.553 --> 08:40.652
       -Will you marry me?
       -[gasps]

08:40.953 --> 08:42.587
Is this for real?

08:42.589 --> 08:44.556
      You want me
      to get the ring certified?

08:44.558 --> 08:46.825
  -Yes, yes!
  -Okay, fine.
  I'll get the ring certified.

08:46.827 --> 08:48.126
No! No. Yes, yes, yes.

08:48.128 --> 08:49.661
I'll marry you.

08:50.731 --> 08:51.997
           [grunting]

08:52.232 --> 08:53.865
     [Lindsay] <i> I'll get it.</i>
     <i> I'll get it.</i>

08:53.867 --> 08:55.166
         <i> I'm so hungry.</i>

08:55.168 --> 08:56.968
          -Oh, no, no!
          -No, no, no!

08:56.970 --> 08:58.169
         [Lindsay] <i> Mmm.</i>

08:59.640 --> 09:01.139
         -[dogs barking]
         -[door opens]

09:01.141 --> 09:04.276
          [laughing] Well,
          they're gonna be okay.

09:04.778 --> 09:08.847
        That's the good news.
        Now we just have to wait
        until they evacuate.

09:10.918 --> 09:13.552
           Poop. We have to wait
           for them to poop.

09:15.322 --> 09:17.188
     What kind of ring was this?

09:18.025 --> 09:19.891
An engagement ring.

09:20.294 --> 09:24.262
          Oh, yes!
        Congratulations!

09:24.798 --> 09:27.966
        Did you know
        that I've been ordained
        in the universal church?

09:29.836 --> 09:31.202
            That's good to know.

09:31.204 --> 09:32.971
     [Delilah]
     Just a little reminder.

09:32.973 --> 09:34.973
      I'm gonna go
      check on them, okay?

09:35.609 --> 09:37.976
Hey, guys! Did you poop yet?

09:39.880 --> 09:40.979
       Oh, Mel.

09:42.015 --> 09:43.114
        Listen.

09:43.350 --> 09:46.251
Despite this little snafu,

09:46.887 --> 09:49.821
today is the best day
of my life.

09:56.597 --> 09:57.862
Worst day of my life!

09:59.333 --> 10:02.100
        So, that's it, huh?
        You're just gonna leave?

10:02.970 --> 10:05.637
      -There's nothing else
      to talk about.
      -Yeah, you know,

10:05.639 --> 10:08.974
    -'cause I thought we had
    something special.
    -Well, so did I!

10:08.976 --> 10:11.242
           But if you're not
           willing to support
           my career decisions--

10:11.244 --> 10:13.378
Moving to Los Angeles
is ridiculous.

10:13.380 --> 10:15.313
Okay, you can
put on makeup here.

10:15.315 --> 10:17.983
    [scoffs] Working for
    the largest cosmetic company
    in the world

10:17.985 --> 10:20.218
  is not just putting on makeup.

10:21.021 --> 10:23.955
     You think that my career
    is just some sort of hobby.

10:25.392 --> 10:28.760
       Your dream of having
       some woman cook and clean

10:28.762 --> 10:31.296
            and take care of you
            is delusional.

10:32.699 --> 10:34.933
So, what, I'm supposed
to sell my parents' ranch, huh?

10:34.935 --> 10:37.636
Give up my entire life
and move with you
to Los Angeles,

10:37.638 --> 10:39.270
the black hole of depravity?

10:40.140 --> 10:41.706
          Tell me
          what you really think.

10:42.909 --> 10:44.275
        [Lindsay] <i> Hey.</i>
        <i> What's going on?</i>

10:44.277 --> 10:45.810
<i> This isn't fair. We are family.</i>

10:45.812 --> 10:47.212
<i> We're supposed to stay togethe.</i>

10:47.214 --> 10:48.947
You know what? Fine.

10:49.416 --> 10:51.116
Go ahead. Go. See if I care.

10:51.351 --> 10:53.118
               You can take back
               your poop ring.

10:53.120 --> 10:54.753
          You want
          Lindsay's sweat socks?

10:54.755 --> 10:56.388
No, no. You know what?
She can keep that.

10:59.226 --> 11:00.792
         You know where I'll be.

11:01.328 --> 11:02.661
You know where I'll be.

11:05.265 --> 11:06.364
                   Goodbye, Mel.

11:11.672 --> 11:13.371
                  [door closes,
                  engine starts]

11:15.108 --> 11:16.207
         Goodbye, Jess.

11:21.782 --> 11:24.282
[Lindsay whining]

11:24.284 --> 11:25.784
   Hey. Don't worry, Lindsay.

11:26.787 --> 11:28.920
     We'll find a new home,
     no matter how.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.122
           You'll see.

12:00.787 --> 12:03.021
              Uh, Jessica,
              could you please
              come to my office?

12:03.490 --> 12:04.789
     Yes, Powers.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.862
     [Lindsay] <i> Powers calls,</i>
     <i> you go running.</i>

12:33.286 --> 12:34.753
         [Lindsay barks]

12:35.522 --> 12:37.822
          Um... Powers?

12:40.360 --> 12:43.461
  -Do you know what time it is?
  -10:34.

12:43.897 --> 12:45.096
           Let me rephrase that.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.834
                Can you guess
                what time it is?

12:50.137 --> 12:51.236
             10:34.

12:52.072 --> 12:55.373
    No. It is time to celebrate.
    [laughs]

12:55.942 --> 12:58.476
-I'll get it. Just-- We're gonna
celebrate this. Watch.
-What?

12:58.478 --> 13:00.812
     Argh. Ooh,
     it's celebration time,
     watch it!

13:00.814 --> 13:02.914
         Whee-hee! Whoo!

13:03.283 --> 13:05.450
    -[cork pops]
    -[Lindsay] <i> Hey, watch it!</i>

13:05.452 --> 13:07.385
         -Uh...
         -Whoo-hoo-hoo!

13:08.421 --> 13:10.522
 Okay. What are we celebrating?

13:10.524 --> 13:13.091
    Your new scent, Xtraordinar,

13:13.093 --> 13:15.827
       has just been approved
       to go to market. [laughs]

13:15.829 --> 13:18.229
That's amazing.
Lindsay, did you hear that-- Oh!

13:18.231 --> 13:20.365
     -[Lindsay] <i> Be careful!</i>
     -Oh, I'm so sorry.

13:20.367 --> 13:22.200
Let me just clean that up.
Just one...

13:22.202 --> 13:23.968
        Never apologize.
        It's a sign of weakness.

13:23.970 --> 13:26.204
       And please,
       we pay people to do that.

13:26.206 --> 13:27.972
       They clean, we celebrate.

13:27.974 --> 13:31.009
Oh. Wow, uh,
so it was already approved?

13:31.011 --> 13:32.377
             With flying scents.

13:33.046 --> 13:34.312
                     I told you,

13:34.815 --> 13:36.314
     with my management prowess,

13:36.316 --> 13:38.216
  you are on the road to success
  in no time.

13:38.218 --> 13:39.918
        And no time is now time.

13:40.287 --> 13:42.253
           Morphascent Cosmetics
           is going to send you

13:42.255 --> 13:45.456
  on a nationwide publicity tour
  to launch Xtraordinar,

13:45.458 --> 13:48.092
           the androgynous scent
           for men and women.

13:48.094 --> 13:49.828
      [Lindsay] <i> What's this</i>
      <i> about a tour?</i>

13:49.830 --> 13:51.496
      <i> You know I have</i>
      <i> abandonment issues.</i>

13:51.498 --> 13:57.302
          A toast,
          to the most beautiful,
          hardworking,

13:57.504 --> 14:02.607
  and soon to make me the rich--
  happiest husband
  on planet Earth.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.042
Oh...

14:05.412 --> 14:06.511
            Lipstick.

14:06.880 --> 14:07.946
         Uh...

14:07.948 --> 14:11.216
I'm sorry, isn't this all
just going a little bit fast?

14:11.218 --> 14:14.052
          Poppycock. You've been
          working on this
          for four long years.

14:14.054 --> 14:17.288
All I did was
just grease the wheels a little,
make them spin faster. Leonard.

14:18.158 --> 14:19.490
        I heard my name.

14:19.492 --> 14:21.492
       -[Lindsay growling]
       -Nice doggy.

14:22.863 --> 14:24.896
           Go on, go on.
           Get the sample.

14:25.198 --> 14:27.131
        Close your eyes.

14:27.133 --> 14:28.266
           [chuckles]

14:29.336 --> 14:31.936
Don't you dare open those eyes.

14:31.938 --> 14:34.873
You're going to be so excited.
I can't wait
to see your reaction.

14:35.609 --> 14:37.041
             Ta-da!

14:38.511 --> 14:39.611
     [Powers] What do you think?

14:41.181 --> 14:42.347
          It's my face.

14:43.183 --> 14:45.116
 [Lindsay] <i> Whoa, that is freaky.</i>

14:45.118 --> 14:47.118
              You're coming into
              your own, Jess.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.954
               And I have got it
            all worked out.

14:49.956 --> 14:52.891
          You're going to go
          on your publicity tour
          to launch Xtraordinar.

14:52.893 --> 14:56.127
  When you get back
  in a few weeks,
  wedding bells will be ringing.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.563
     We are going to get married
     in a hot-air balloon,

14:58.565 --> 15:01.165
    followed by a flock of doves
    over hundreds of people.

15:01.167 --> 15:03.635
     Everyone is gonna be there.
     Possibly even
     a few people you know.

15:04.004 --> 15:06.437
 Uh... Well, what about Lindsay?

15:06.940 --> 15:08.673
       -Who?
       -Lindsay, the dog.

15:08.675 --> 15:10.108
 [Lindsay] <i> Yeah. What about me?</i>

15:12.078 --> 15:14.045
   <i> I go everywhere with her.</i>

15:14.046 --> 15:16.013
     Oh! Oh. Well, yeah, I mean,
     she'll be the pup of honor.

15:16.182 --> 15:18.616
    [Lindsay] <i> You know</i>
    <i> I don't like you, right?</i>

15:18.618 --> 15:20.618
     No, no. I meant
     for the publicity tour.

15:20.620 --> 15:23.054
        -No, no, no.
        -Oh. No. No dogs.

15:23.390 --> 15:25.456
 -Jess, no.
 -We don't want dogs on a pub--

15:25.458 --> 15:28.059
    They can't smell perfume.
    They s-- You know. Pss...

15:28.595 --> 15:30.561
    You guys know
    that I can't go anywhere
    without her.

15:30.563 --> 15:32.263
    [Lindsay]
    <i> Yes. Put that foot down.</i>

15:32.265 --> 15:33.398
   <i> Just watch where you step.</i>

15:33.400 --> 15:36.234
           Well, of course
           you won't go
           anywhere without her.

15:36.236 --> 15:41.039
Or my-- Your assistant, Leonard.
He will be there
the whole entire time.

15:41.574 --> 15:45.176
      And if there's anything
      you need, he will be there
      to fetch it for you.

15:45.378 --> 15:46.611
             So to speak.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.646
I'll be there.
I'll be there. Yeah.

15:49.249 --> 15:51.115
        So, is everything ready?

15:51.117 --> 15:52.550
[Leonard]
Oh, everything is ready,
Mr. Andrews. Yeah.

15:52.552 --> 15:54.285
The tickets are purchased.
The bags are packed.

15:54.287 --> 15:55.653
I hired a nice little driver.

15:55.655 --> 15:57.588
Ex-military, I think.
Special Ops.

15:58.058 --> 16:00.658
And you're going to need
to dust off your cowboy boots,

16:00.660 --> 16:02.961
because we are going to Montana!

16:02.963 --> 16:04.228
 [Lindsay] <i> What did he just say?</i>

16:04.230 --> 16:06.164
        I'm sorry, wait.
        Um, Montana?

16:06.166 --> 16:08.366
    Yeah, I figured that we'd
    stack the deck in our favor.

16:08.368 --> 16:10.001
       Hometown girl makes good.

16:10.003 --> 16:12.070
           You'll be a smash.
           Toast of the town.

16:12.072 --> 16:14.205
     -They have toast
     in Montana, right?
     -[Leonard] I think so.

16:14.207 --> 16:17.175
    I'm sorry. I just haven't
    been back to Montana,
    you know, since...

16:17.644 --> 16:19.177
    well, since I left.

16:19.179 --> 16:20.645
      Oh, yeah.
      And you left a nobody

16:20.647 --> 16:22.313
 and you're coming back a star.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.015
      The publicity
      practically writes itself.

16:24.017 --> 16:25.383
        In fact, Leonard,

16:25.385 --> 16:26.551
     get our people on that
     right away.

16:26.553 --> 16:27.652
[Leonard] I'll be on it.

16:27.654 --> 16:28.720
       [Powers] I love you, kid.

16:28.722 --> 16:30.188
    Big things are afoot for us.

16:30.190 --> 16:32.090
     Big things, for both of us!

16:32.092 --> 16:36.160
   And listen. Don't forget
   this is a cutthroat business.

16:36.563 --> 16:38.663
       It is a dog-eat-dog world
       out there.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.398
    -No offense. [chuckles]
    -[Lindsay] <i> Dog eat what?</i>

16:40.400 --> 16:42.633
               But... I want you
               to do me a favor.

16:42.635 --> 16:44.769
     Do not listen
     to what anybody has to say.

16:44.771 --> 16:48.139
     No one. You just do
     what you feel in your heart
     is right.

16:48.408 --> 16:51.442
      Unless that person
      knows what's best for you.

16:52.045 --> 16:53.111
            Like me.

16:53.246 --> 16:54.612
            [laughs]

16:54.614 --> 16:56.614
     -Lipstick.
     -[Leonard] Mr. Andrews.

16:56.783 --> 16:59.384
Could I talk to you about the...
a little bit? The pronunciation?

16:59.386 --> 17:01.019
          -Sure, yeah.
          -Yes.

17:02.655 --> 17:05.356
         What do you think about
         Extraordinaire?

17:05.492 --> 17:06.723
        Uh... I hate it.

17:07.460 --> 17:08.559
              Wow.

17:09.396 --> 17:11.329
        -[Lindsay whines]
        -Well...

17:12.598 --> 17:14.565
             All right, Lindsay.
             What do you say?

17:15.300 --> 17:18.569
   You and me, kiddo,
   on an adventure to Montana.

17:19.506 --> 17:21.806
     [Lindsay] <i> Montana, huh?</i>
     <i> How's the weather</i>
     <i> this time of year?</i>

17:21.808 --> 17:23.374
      [gasps]
      <i> Will I get dry fur?</i>

17:54.507 --> 17:57.775
 [Haley] <i> Howdy, Clark.</i>
 <i> What's the word on the street,</i>
 <i> Martin?</i>

17:58.378 --> 18:00.845
       <i> Hey there, Julie.</i>
       <i> Good to see you.</i>

18:02.215 --> 18:04.682
<i> Hey, ladies. Looking good toda.</i>

18:04.684 --> 18:05.850
         [Haley barking]

18:05.852 --> 18:08.786
     Hey. Quit your barking.

18:09.155 --> 18:11.589
   [Haley]
   <i> Just greeting the world.</i>
   <i> You should give it a try.</i>

18:11.591 --> 18:13.391
    Well, you're all excited,
    aren't you?

18:13.593 --> 18:17.228
 Gonna go see Delilah Higgins
 in your dog park resort, right?

18:17.230 --> 18:19.630
     [Haley] <i> Oh, great.</i>
     <i> I can see my friends.</i>

18:19.632 --> 18:21.399
  We just got one stop to make.

18:22.569 --> 18:24.302
    Gotta keep the lights on,
    don't we?

18:25.138 --> 18:27.305
     And keep you fed. Huh?

18:27.307 --> 18:30.441
[Haley] <i> You know getting fed</i>
<i> is always high on my to-do lis.</i>

18:42.155 --> 18:43.488
        -Have a nice day.
        -Thanks.

18:45.258 --> 18:47.258
  [Haley] <i> Hey,</i>
  <i> what are you carrying there?</i>

18:47.260 --> 18:48.860
  [gasps] <i> Is that food for me?</i>

18:49.596 --> 18:51.562
        -Hey, Sally Ann.
        -Hey, Mel.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.565
   -Where's your father?
   -He takes weekends off now,

18:54.567 --> 18:57.301
but he gave me permission
to pay you top dollar.

18:57.637 --> 18:58.736
                 Thanks.

18:58.738 --> 19:03.441
      [laughs] You know,
      you might be overpaying me
      just a little bit.

19:03.443 --> 19:06.544
You're our best provider, Mel.
You're worth every penny
and then some.

19:07.213 --> 19:10.314
So, where's the town's
most eligible bachelor
off to now?

19:10.583 --> 19:13.518
  -Uh, Delilah Higgins' place.
  -Still volunteering there?

19:13.520 --> 19:15.486
         Yeah, you know,
         she could use the help.

19:15.488 --> 19:18.523
        You know her knees
        and hips and back and...

19:18.525 --> 19:20.324
    [laughs]
    It's not what it used to be.

19:20.627 --> 19:22.426
        Besides, Haley loves it.

19:22.428 --> 19:25.196
[Haley] <i> That's true.</i>
<i> But not as much as I love food.</i>

19:25.532 --> 19:29.600
Sometimes I think
you like hanging around more
with animals than you do people.

19:30.336 --> 19:33.638
You ever think about
settling down with someone
with two legs, rather than four?

19:34.274 --> 19:37.341
       I don't know.
       At least with animals,
       you know where you stand.

19:37.744 --> 19:39.744
You're always
in good standing with me,
Mel.

19:39.746 --> 19:41.412
You too, Haley.

19:41.414 --> 19:42.713
     [Haley sniffs]
     <i> Something smells good.</i>

19:43.483 --> 19:45.616
Got you two more bags
of your favorite dog food.

19:46.286 --> 19:48.486
Oh. Would you mind
putting that in my pickup truck?

19:48.488 --> 19:49.687
            -Red one?
            -Yeah.

19:49.689 --> 19:50.888
           -Of course.
           -Thank you.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.457
          You trying to win over
          my dog's heart?

19:54.961 --> 19:55.843
It's a start.

19:55.844 --> 19:56.726
So, you're gonna go
to the fair this weekend?

19:56.729 --> 19:58.429
            Yeah, I'll be there.

19:58.431 --> 20:00.231
          My beef stew's
          gonna win first place.

20:00.233 --> 20:02.233
[sighs] And he cooks too.

20:03.937 --> 20:06.337
      -I'll see you around,
      Sally Ann.
      -Count on it.

20:06.339 --> 20:08.339
-Come on. Let's go, Haley.
-[Haley] <i> Can I ride in the back?</i>

20:08.341 --> 20:09.840
  <i> -I wanna protect that grub.</i>
  -Thanks, bud.

20:29.729 --> 20:34.365
   -Now, I have your itinerary
   right here.
   -Okay.

20:35.335 --> 20:37.535
 -Here you go.
 -[Lindsay]
 <i> I'm Ms. Reynolds' consultant.</i>

20:37.537 --> 20:40.738
  <i> -I'll look over these first.</i>
  -Lindsay.
  Those aren't for you.

20:41.307 --> 20:42.707
       -[Lindsay] <i> My bad.</i>
       -I just... [sighs]

20:42.709 --> 20:44.275
     I don't know
     what's gotten into her.

20:44.477 --> 20:45.610
       The devil, perhaps.

20:45.612 --> 20:49.380
  Mutt could use a shock collar
  and some little cement shoes.

20:49.515 --> 20:51.816
 [Lindsay] <i> Try it, and you'll be</i>
 <i> singing soprano forever.</i>

20:53.720 --> 20:56.621
   Oh! No, Lindsay, get off.
   Get off, Lindsay. Stop it.

20:56.623 --> 20:58.556
       -Oh... Ah. Oh.
       -[Lindsay growling]

20:58.558 --> 21:01.292
Lindsay, stop it. Get off of me.

21:02.662 --> 21:04.595
          -Disgusting.
          -[sighs]

21:51.978 --> 21:53.411
         You wanna check it out?

21:53.413 --> 21:54.779
  [Haley] <i> Does a dog get fleas?</i>

21:55.581 --> 21:56.681
                  All right.

21:57.750 --> 21:58.949
                          Go on.

21:59.886 --> 22:01.952
       -Hey, you're back!
       -Yeah.

22:02.789 --> 22:04.388
               What did you say?

22:04.390 --> 22:07.458
    -I said, yeah, I'm back.
    -No, my back's fine.

22:07.460 --> 22:10.061
       About the only part of me
       that is fine these days,
       but...

22:10.730 --> 22:12.363
How are you feeling?

22:12.365 --> 22:14.498
           Well, you know,
           it comes and it goes.

22:15.635 --> 22:17.868
            Mel, this is
            none of my business,

22:18.738 --> 22:20.671
        but I really don't think
        it's healthy for you

22:20.673 --> 22:22.640
             to be spending
             all your time here.

22:23.576 --> 22:25.910
        You know there is
        a whole world out there.

22:26.512 --> 22:27.645
                There are women.

22:28.448 --> 22:29.547
                 There's dating.

22:30.016 --> 22:31.115
                          Women.

22:31.117 --> 22:34.385
               Bingo.
               Bingo tournaments
               with women.

22:34.387 --> 22:37.355
           There's skydiving,
           which you would love!

22:37.357 --> 22:38.889
           Skydiving with women.
           There you go.

22:38.891 --> 22:40.558
I like it here.

22:41.461 --> 22:42.860
       Of course I can hear you.

22:43.463 --> 22:45.496
              I'm not that deaf.
              Not yet.

22:45.898 --> 22:50.034
      But you know what I think?
      I'm beginning
      to have my memory going.

22:50.036 --> 22:53.070
Delilah,
don't worry about me, okay?
I'm gonna be fine.

22:53.639 --> 22:56.073
And I got my ranch.
Business is great.

22:56.075 --> 22:59.377
You know, Haley...
Haley's amazing.

22:59.946 --> 23:01.512
    How do I put this subtly?

23:02.548 --> 23:04.949
     You need a girlfriend, Mel!

23:05.585 --> 23:07.685
You know, you're the one
who's hard of hearing.

23:08.388 --> 23:10.521
           -Not me.
           -Yes, you.

23:10.523 --> 23:13.391
        I've seen the way
        these girls look at you.

23:14.060 --> 23:16.727
 At least I would,
if everything wasn't so blurry.

23:17.430 --> 23:19.029
       And I hear things.

23:20.466 --> 23:23.033
       A little muffled,
       but I do hear them.

23:25.638 --> 23:28.906
What is going on
with you and Sally Ann, huh?

23:30.076 --> 23:33.077
             We're just friends.
             She's not my type.

23:33.079 --> 23:34.812
Who cares if she can type?

23:35.148 --> 23:38.816
That's a very overrated skill,
especially in this day and age.

23:39.118 --> 23:44.688
The point is, she's a female.
She's a human female.

23:44.690 --> 23:47.758
            I get it, I get it.
            She's a member
            of the opposite sex.

23:48.194 --> 23:51.429
[laughing]
She's not opposed to sex,
not that one.

23:51.431 --> 23:53.697
That's the silliest thing
I've ever heard.

23:54.467 --> 23:55.933
And I do hear things.

23:56.135 --> 23:57.935
     Guess who's
     coming into town today?

23:59.505 --> 24:00.604
              Who?

24:01.474 --> 24:02.640
        I asked you. Who?

24:03.142 --> 24:04.475
       What was I saying?

24:05.611 --> 24:08.179
Oh, gosh. Oh, I hate this.
You know, I...

24:08.981 --> 24:11.115
I think
my memory's starting to go.

24:11.117 --> 24:13.517
  [chuckles] Do you need
  some dog food for the kennel?

24:13.519 --> 24:14.985
 'Cause I got a ton in my truck.

24:14.987 --> 24:16.687
You know what?

24:16.689 --> 24:19.590
We could really use
some dog food for the kennel.

24:19.592 --> 24:20.858
Do you have any extra
in your truck?

24:21.661 --> 24:22.860
         I'll see what I can do.

24:22.862 --> 24:27.064
No, I can't see
what you're doing.
But I trust you.

24:33.506 --> 24:35.906
           Good boy.
           You want another one?

24:35.908 --> 24:37.575
         Come on.
         You want another treat?

24:38.044 --> 24:41.011
               Oh, good boy.
               You're beautiful.
               Mm-hmm.

24:42.248 --> 24:47.618
  So, my thought was to create
  a new fragrance for women
  on the go.

24:47.854 --> 24:52.490
      Something that blends
      with your...

24:53.793 --> 24:57.728
  natural scent.
  Uh, and really highlights...

24:58.865 --> 24:59.997
             the...

25:01.234 --> 25:03.267
      well, just highlights
      positive stuff,

25:03.269 --> 25:07.938
   um, which is why Xtraordinar
   is truly extraordinary. Um...

25:08.608 --> 25:11.842
-It really accents the positive.
-[Lindsay whines] <i> Oh, boy.</i>
<i> She's not doing too well.</i>

25:11.844 --> 25:13.911
  -[Jessica] And then it, um...
  -[Lindsay] <i> I've got</i>
  <i> to stop this.</i>

25:13.913 --> 25:16.213
   ...says, "Negative, no way.
   Get out of here."

25:16.215 --> 25:18.782
     Okay. Let me just
     give you guys a sample.

25:19.252 --> 25:20.584
          Here you go.

25:20.586 --> 25:23.521
  [Lindsay] <i> Oh, it smells like</i>
  <i> the Botanical Gardens</i>

25:23.523 --> 25:25.022
    <i> caught on fire in here.</i>

25:25.024 --> 25:26.724
[woman] When will
this be available to buy?

25:26.726 --> 25:28.158
   Um, I can actually give you
   a free sample.

25:28.160 --> 25:29.860
   [Lindsay] <i> This is torture.</i>

25:29.862 --> 25:31.095
     <i> I have to do</i>
     <i> something about this.</i>

25:31.097 --> 25:32.229
     [Jessica] So, smell up.

25:32.231 --> 25:33.631
No! Lindsay!

25:33.633 --> 25:34.765
   [Jessica] Lindsay! Oh, no!

25:34.767 --> 25:36.066
          Lindsay! Oh!

25:37.303 --> 25:38.736
         [Lindsay barks]

26:11.637 --> 26:13.637
   -[Lindsay] <i> Hey!</i>
   <i> This isn't cool!</i>
   -Does anyone have a towel?

26:13.639 --> 26:16.941
        I'll clean everything--
        Oh, my goodness.
        Oh, God. Oh, no. [gasps]

26:16.943 --> 26:19.043
        [women laughing]

26:20.179 --> 26:22.046
      Lindsay, I appreciate
      your efforts,

26:22.048 --> 26:24.281
    but you will not
    be bothering Ms. Reynolds
    anymore.

26:24.283 --> 26:29.587
You're going to go away
and disappear,
and I'm going to see to it.

26:29.589 --> 26:33.357
  [Lindsay] <i> Can't blame this</i>
  <i> on me. I've been framed.</i>
  <i> I want to speak to a lawyer.</i>

26:33.359 --> 26:34.692
        [sighs]

26:35.895 --> 26:37.661
            [panting]

26:37.663 --> 26:39.063
          [phone rings]

26:39.065 --> 26:40.764
       -Speak!
       -It's Leonard, sir.

26:40.766 --> 26:43.934
Um, everything's going great,
except for the dog.

26:43.936 --> 26:46.203
The dog is terrible.
Trying to ruin everything.

26:46.205 --> 26:48.038
       Oh, God, I hate that dog.

26:48.641 --> 26:50.274
        Can't you lose it
        in Montana or something?

26:50.276 --> 26:52.142
  Isn't there pastures out there
  you can leave it in?

26:52.144 --> 26:54.011
There are a lot of pastures
with deep holes.

26:54.013 --> 26:56.347
            Good. Well, find one
            that preferably has
            some wolves

26:56.349 --> 26:59.717
or mountain lions
or some kind of bear in it
or something and leave it there.

27:00.019 --> 27:03.687
No way I'm letting that fleabag
get in the way of me
profiting off Jessica's success.

27:04.056 --> 27:06.890
  I have worked way too hard
  watching her work way too hard
  for this.

27:06.892 --> 27:09.259
     -You understand me?
     -Understood, yes. Yes.

27:09.261 --> 27:11.095
         Leonard, you're my eyes
         and ears out there.

27:11.364 --> 27:14.164
  If she blinks, if she sneezes,

27:14.166 --> 27:16.834
        if she even breaks wind,
        I want to know about it.

27:16.836 --> 27:18.302
           <i> I want to know</i>
           <i> what it smells like,</i>

27:18.304 --> 27:20.004
           <i> what it sounds like,</i>
           <i> the texture.</i>

27:20.006 --> 27:22.239
    <i> And I want a demonstration,</i>
    <i> you hear me?</i>

27:22.241 --> 27:24.174
         -Okay.
         <i> -Over and out.</i>

27:24.176 --> 27:26.276
            [panting]

27:34.286 --> 27:36.320
         -Hey, buddy.
         -Call me Frank.

27:36.322 --> 27:38.389
           -Franklyn?
           -Whatever.

27:38.391 --> 27:40.290
Okay. Well,
with your local knowledge,

27:40.292 --> 27:42.993
do you have any way
of making a dog disappear?

27:42.995 --> 27:45.863
 -You mean... [whooshing] disa--
 -No, no. No, no.

27:46.132 --> 27:47.998
Just hidden for a while.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.434
         Right down the road.
         Big Sky Animal Shelter.

27:50.836 --> 27:52.202
Will you take that dog there?

27:54.173 --> 27:55.372
   Here you go. Will that do?

27:55.875 --> 27:57.875
Okay. And my bag
is getting heavy.

27:58.144 --> 28:00.678
Will you take it
to our next appointment?
We'll be walking.

28:00.913 --> 28:02.012
        Okay?

28:02.181 --> 28:03.280
Thanks, Franklyn.

28:17.730 --> 28:19.830
      [vehicle approaching]

28:23.469 --> 28:27.004
[Lindsay] <i> Unfair, I say.</i>
<i> This treatment shouldn't happen</i>
<i> to a dog.</i>

28:27.006 --> 28:29.306
  [gasps] <i> Hey,</i>
  <i> this place smells familiar.</i>

28:32.912 --> 28:34.011
         Can I help you?

28:34.013 --> 28:37.715
    Uh, yes, ma'am.
    I've got this rather
    rambunctious little dog.

28:37.717 --> 28:40.184
  I need a place for him to stay
  for a few hours.

28:40.486 --> 28:42.086
A place to play.

28:42.088 --> 28:43.454
                Yeah, that'll be
                fine too, yeah.

28:43.456 --> 28:45.222
Oh, no, no,
we don't charge fines.

28:45.825 --> 28:47.391
We take all animals here.

28:47.393 --> 28:50.060
However, we do take donations.

28:50.062 --> 28:53.030
   Er, yes, thank you very much.
   I'll be back by the end
   of the day to pick him up.

28:53.032 --> 28:54.164
            Thank you very much.

28:58.204 --> 29:00.137
         -Lindsay?
         <i> -Hey, Delilah.</i>

29:00.806 --> 29:04.508
                 [laughing] Ooh.

29:05.778 --> 29:07.077
                        Oh, boy.

29:07.947 --> 29:09.780
                        Oh, boy.

29:10.082 --> 29:11.448
                   There you go.

29:14.320 --> 29:17.488
[chuckles] Hey, I noticed
you're also running low
on some bedding pads,

29:17.490 --> 29:19.857
so I'll run into town
and pick some up.

29:19.859 --> 29:22.326
         You're going into town?
         Could you pick us up
         some bedding pads?

29:22.328 --> 29:23.861
   We're kinda running low here.

29:23.996 --> 29:26.797
[chuckles]
That's a good idea, Delilah.

29:27.099 --> 29:29.166
    Yeah. Still sharp as a twig.
    [chuckles]

29:31.036 --> 29:32.803
Be back soon, girl.
Keep an eye on her.

29:32.805 --> 29:34.438
     [Lindsay] <i> Wait,</i>
     <i> was he talking to me?</i>

29:35.541 --> 29:38.208
            Tack! Tack!
            I'm sharp as a tack!

29:52.892 --> 29:54.358
           [sniffing]

29:55.161 --> 29:57.294
    [Lindsay] <i> Hey!</i>
    <i> That's my sister's sock!</i>

<i> Stealers weepers!</i>

30:00.533 --> 30:02.432
      <i> You're a dead dog</i>
      <i> if I can catch you.</i>

30:02.434 --> 30:04.268
<i> Hey! Get back here, that's min!</i>

30:04.270 --> 30:05.936
  [brown dog laughs] <i> Mine now.</i>

30:09.208 --> 30:11.441
     Uh-huh, uh-huh.
     So then what happened?

30:11.944 --> 30:15.078
    So, I go up to that chicken
    and I say in my scary voice,

30:15.347 --> 30:19.049
  "You better start laying eggs,
  Bucko, or else!"

30:19.418 --> 30:20.484
        Or else what?

30:20.486 --> 30:23.587
       Well, that's what's great
       about "or else."

30:23.589 --> 30:25.355
       You don't need specifics.

30:25.558 --> 30:27.925
       It's like the worst thing
       you can imagine.

30:27.927 --> 30:31.361
      Let me tell you,
      Bucko the chicken
      started laying eggs.

30:32.865 --> 30:35.165
      Zeik! Where you going
      in such a hurry?

30:35.401 --> 30:36.934
          Running away from you.

30:39.505 --> 30:41.505
    Hey, what's the big idea?

30:41.507 --> 30:43.540
Pardon me.
I was just chasing...

30:43.943 --> 30:45.542
 [both] Why do you look like me?

30:45.544 --> 30:47.110
 [both]
 Stop repeating what I'm saying!

30:47.112 --> 30:49.279
   [both] Stop it! I mean it!

30:49.281 --> 30:50.380
          [both] Jinx!

30:50.382 --> 30:52.349
       Who put a mirror in here?

30:52.351 --> 30:54.151
Why do you two look alike?

30:54.153 --> 30:56.286
            -Haley?
            -Lindsay?

30:56.522 --> 30:58.188
       [chuckles] <i> Freaky Friday!</i>

30:58.190 --> 31:00.290
Nah, that's
a different movie, Zeik.

31:00.292 --> 31:02.192
             -Sis?
             -Wha--

31:02.595 --> 31:05.996
       -Where you been?
       -Sis! LA with Jess.
    What about you?

31:05.998 --> 31:09.266
Right here with Mel.
We never left the old homestead.
Remember?

31:09.268 --> 31:12.870
Actually, it's kind of hazy.
I was just a puppy back then.

31:12.872 --> 31:14.404
      What was I, chicken liver?

31:14.406 --> 31:16.406
              We have lots of
              catching up to do.

31:16.408 --> 31:17.875
           What brings you back?

31:17.877 --> 31:19.276
Jess is doing a publicity tour

31:19.278 --> 31:21.278
for the new smell she invented.

31:21.280 --> 31:23.180
    [Haley] <i> Huh? Jess smells?</i>

31:23.182 --> 31:25.082
     [Lindsay] <i> All the time.</i>
     <i> It's her business.</i>

31:25.084 --> 31:27.384
 <i> She's a professional smeller.</i>

31:27.386 --> 31:31.088
  <i> I don't mind,</i>
  <i> but I don't like</i>
  <i> the people she smells with.</i>

31:31.390 --> 31:34.224
<i> She has this assistant, Leonar,</i>
<i> who hates me.</i>

31:34.526 --> 31:36.260
  <i> I don't care for him either.</i>

31:36.262 --> 31:37.661
       <i> And she's engaged</i>
       <i> to this Powers guy</i>

31:37.663 --> 31:39.563
     <i> I really don't trust.</i>

31:39.565 --> 31:41.999
      [Haley] <i> At least</i>
      <i> she's with someone.</i>

31:42.001 --> 31:43.500
        <i> Mel's all alone.</i>

31:43.502 --> 31:45.469
<i> He acts like he's cool with it,</i>

31:45.471 --> 31:48.105
  <i> but I can sense he's lonely,</i>
  <i> even with me around.</i>

31:48.107 --> 31:50.073
    <i> I think he misses Jess.</i>

31:50.075 --> 31:52.142
     [Lindsay]
     <i> I barely remember Mel,</i>

31:52.144 --> 31:54.077
    <i> but I bet Jess would be</i>
    <i> better off with him</i>

31:54.079 --> 31:55.545
    <i> than Powers and Leonard.</i>

31:55.547 --> 31:57.180
    [Haley]
    Hey, wouldn't it be great

31:57.182 --> 31:59.583
       if Jess and Mel
       got back together?

31:59.585 --> 32:01.418
   [Lindsay] <i> Then we could be</i>
   <i> a family again.</i>

32:01.420 --> 32:03.186
          <i> But, wait...</i>

32:03.188 --> 32:06.089
    <i> When we get back to LA,</i>
    <i> she's getting married.</i>

32:07.393 --> 32:09.326
[Haley]
<i> Well, we cannot let that happe.</i>

32:09.695 --> 32:12.963
        You have to stop her
        from leaving so we can
        hook our humans back up.

32:13.432 --> 32:16.700
  How? I don't know the detours
  in this town like you do.

32:18.037 --> 32:20.537
       I got it! I got it!
       [gasps]

32:20.539 --> 32:22.039
                    Fleas again?

32:22.041 --> 32:28.178
   No, Zeik. We switch places.
   I'll be you, and you be me.

32:28.180 --> 32:31.214
    -Say what?
    -Once they figured out
    they have the wrong dog,

32:31.216 --> 32:33.183
    they'll have to return us
    to each other.

32:33.185 --> 32:35.552
 Crisscross.
 Then we all meet in the middle

32:35.554 --> 32:37.387
   like a deer in headlights.

32:37.656 --> 32:38.956
              Bam!

32:39.124 --> 32:40.257
        It'll never work.

32:40.559 --> 32:43.360
      We're nothing alike,
      personality wise.

32:43.629 --> 32:46.029
  I got plenty of personality.

32:46.966 --> 32:50.634
     I'm talking about
     the way you act.
     You're too... country.

32:50.636 --> 32:52.402
        And proud of it!

32:52.404 --> 32:54.104
    If you're going to be me,

32:54.106 --> 32:56.306
   you have to have
   a certain amount of class.

32:56.308 --> 32:59.042
 Walk tall, watch your manners,
 only eat meat
 that is well cooked

32:59.044 --> 33:00.711
      or at the very least
      medium rare.

33:01.180 --> 33:03.680
   No problemo.
   And if you're gonna be me,

33:03.682 --> 33:05.449
    you gotta get
    a little down and dirty.

33:05.985 --> 33:09.019
  Don't be a stick in the mud.
  Play. Let loose.

33:09.021 --> 33:12.255
     Pee where you want,
     when you want,
     and make no apologies.

33:12.257 --> 33:15.392
 Oh, and there's one more thing.

33:17.029 --> 33:18.328
    [Lindsay]
    Hey! What are you doing?

33:18.330 --> 33:21.164
 [gasps] Oh, my God. I'm naked!

33:21.166 --> 33:24.134
     Give me a break.
     Now you pull off mine.

33:32.344 --> 33:33.610
                   Fancy, fancy.

33:50.295 --> 33:53.230
          Well, I think
          that went wonderfully,
          Ms. Reynolds.

33:53.632 --> 33:55.265
Better than last time.

33:59.071 --> 34:00.137
            Lindsay?

34:00.138 --> 34:01.204
Where's my dog?
Why isn't she in the car?

34:01.206 --> 34:04.374
    I thought she was. Franklyn,
    where's Ms. Reynolds' dog?

34:05.177 --> 34:07.377
     -At the animal shelter,
    like we spoke.
     -What?

34:07.379 --> 34:08.812
           You put Lindsay
           in an animal shelter?

34:08.813 --> 34:10.679
         Why would you
         do something like that?

34:11.449 --> 34:13.750
   -We'll get her back, ASAP.
   -Yes, we will.

34:13.752 --> 34:16.319
Not happy about this.
Not happy at all.

34:19.591 --> 34:21.091
                  Shh.

34:27.299 --> 34:28.764
                    Shh.

34:43.614 --> 34:46.550
  [Lindsay] <i> Hey, Delilah.</i>
  <i> Hoping you can help us out.</i>

34:46.784 --> 34:47.851
       What happened here?

34:48.654 --> 34:50.219
    [Haley]
    <i> I don't know about this.</i>

34:50.222 --> 34:51.521
      <i> I hope she gets it.</i>

34:57.529 --> 34:59.596
                 Ah, you two!

35:00.165 --> 35:01.465
               All right.

35:05.571 --> 35:06.670
             There.

35:07.139 --> 35:10.407
       Yeah.
       Stay. All right, hang on.

35:10.876 --> 35:12.175
        [Haley] <i> Success!</i>

35:12.778 --> 35:14.344
      <i> Let the games begin!</i>

35:16.348 --> 35:17.814
[Mel clears throat]

35:17.816 --> 35:19.382
All right.
Here you go, Delilah.

35:20.152 --> 35:21.251
               Where am I going?

35:21.553 --> 35:22.853
I don't know
where you're going, Delilah,

35:22.855 --> 35:24.421
but I'm going. I'm going home.

35:24.423 --> 35:25.689
     -Oh.
     -I gotta start cooking

35:25.691 --> 35:27.124
if I'm gonna be ready
for the fair.

35:27.126 --> 35:28.492
            Mm-hmm. What's this?

35:28.494 --> 35:30.127
These are bedding pads.

35:33.465 --> 35:34.598
See you later, Delilah.

35:34.600 --> 35:37.767
      No, I won't see you.
      I'm going blind, remember?

35:43.509 --> 35:46.576
[whistles]
Let's go, Haley!
Time to go. Playtime's over!

35:46.845 --> 35:49.579
       Okay. So how will
       we stay in contact?

35:49.581 --> 35:51.581
   Don't worry. I'll find you.

35:51.850 --> 35:54.818
Okay. I trust you. Good luck.

35:54.820 --> 35:57.521
   [Mel] Haley, come on! Hey.

35:57.523 --> 36:01.892
Yeah! Oh, yeah!
Hey. Hey, girl.

36:01.894 --> 36:03.260
Hey, did you miss me?

36:05.564 --> 36:07.915
Yeah, I missed you.

36:07.916 --> 36:10.267
It's good to see you too.
Yeah, come on.
Homeward bound. Let's go.

36:11.403 --> 36:12.903
All right, Delilah,
we'll see you later.

36:24.416 --> 36:26.850
Lindsay? Lindsay better be here.

36:27.719 --> 36:30.854
I'm sorry,
I just thought it would be
in the dog's best interest to...

36:31.490 --> 36:33.957
    not be at the presentations.

36:33.959 --> 36:35.292
            Delilah?

36:35.861 --> 36:38.795
Jessie Reynolds! Oh...

36:38.797 --> 36:42.465
Wonderful. I knew
someone important
was coming to town.

36:42.935 --> 36:45.435
  Oh, my goodness.
  So, you're still working here.

36:45.437 --> 36:50.307
Dear, I may be too old for men,
but one is never too old
for dogs.

36:50.976 --> 36:53.210
     Well, I hear that dogs
     take better care of you
     than men anyway.

36:53.212 --> 36:56.980
Oh! You're telling me.
They certainly do. [chuckles]

36:56.982 --> 36:58.815
   -How long are you here for?
   -Uh...

36:58.817 --> 37:00.951
             Just a--
             just a short while.

37:00.953 --> 37:02.819
        We're just
        passing through, really.

37:02.821 --> 37:04.321
        -Oh.
        -Is Lindsay here?

37:04.623 --> 37:05.722
       Yeah.

37:06.225 --> 37:08.225
          -She is. Yes.
          -Oh.

37:08.227 --> 37:12.429
         Oh, thank God. Lindsay!
         Oh, my goodness! Girl!

37:12.965 --> 37:15.398
          -Oh, Lindsay!
          <i> -Jessie!</i>

37:15.667 --> 37:18.735
          Aw, I've missed ya.
          I've missed you, girl.

37:20.339 --> 37:21.538
Oh, my goodness.

37:21.540 --> 37:22.772
  [Delilah] A girl and her dog.

37:22.774 --> 37:25.308
    There's no sweeter thing
    on earth.

37:26.511 --> 37:28.678
You're planning to see Mel
while you're here?

37:28.680 --> 37:32.315
               Uh, no. Um...
               I don't think so.

37:32.317 --> 37:34.417
     I doubt if he'd really want
     to see me again.

37:34.419 --> 37:36.720
[Delilah] Oh, I doubt
that you're right about that.

37:37.422 --> 37:38.888
        Do you see Mel often?

37:38.890 --> 37:40.790
[Delilah] I don't see
much often anymore, dear.

37:40.792 --> 37:43.026
I'm blind as a beagle.
Blind as a bat!

37:43.028 --> 37:44.594
        Speaking of bats,

37:44.596 --> 37:45.862
       we should be using
       our echolocators

37:45.864 --> 37:47.430
    and going to the airport.

37:47.432 --> 37:49.032
Who's your lovely
tall lady friend, dear?

37:49.668 --> 37:51.434
     [chuckles] This is Leonard.

37:51.737 --> 37:58.508
Well, that's a strange name
for a gal, in Montana anyway.
[laughs]

37:58.910 --> 38:02.746
  We should really be going.
  Tight schedule,
  and this place smells like...

38:03.382 --> 38:04.714
[Delilah] I like it too.

38:05.484 --> 38:06.716
Take a deep breath...

38:07.286 --> 38:10.787
through your nostrils,
and you're home! [laughs]

38:10.789 --> 38:12.289
         [Leonard] Okay.

38:12.691 --> 38:13.890
      It was so good to see you.

38:13.892 --> 38:17.827
    -Take care, Delilah.
    -These days,
    I'll take what I can get.

38:17.829 --> 38:19.663
         [all laughing]

38:19.665 --> 38:21.598
All right.
Come on, Lindsay girl, let's go.

38:22.567 --> 38:26.036
      -So nice to meet you.
      Lessie, Lesley?
      -Leonard.

38:26.605 --> 38:29.472
    -Leonard.
    -Lesley.
    Nice to meet you, Lesley!

38:29.474 --> 38:32.642
   -You're lovely.
   Bye. Take care of Jess.
   -I'm going. All right, bye.

38:45.390 --> 38:47.757
       [Lindsay] <i> My home.</i>
       <i> My real home!</i>

38:47.759 --> 38:49.926
          Come on.
          Got some stew to cook.

38:50.462 --> 38:52.595
      You got some eating to do.
      It's dinnertime.

38:53.498 --> 38:56.633
 [Lindsay] <i> Dinner sounds</i>
<i> like an excellent idea to me.</i>

38:57.569 --> 39:00.003
    [Haley] <i> Jeez. Never been</i>
    <i> in a spaceship before.</i>

39:00.672 --> 39:02.772
           I'm sorry
           that I yelled at you,
           Leonard.

39:03.709 --> 39:05.575
            I know you were
            just trying to help.

39:06.111 --> 39:08.044
It's okay, Ms. Reynolds.
No harm, no foul.

39:08.046 --> 39:10.647
     [Haley] <i> Don't get</i>
     <i> much sun in here, huh.</i>

39:10.649 --> 39:14.084
We are a little behind,
but we should be able to make
the next flight to Dallas.

39:14.086 --> 39:17.887
-Franklyn, step on it.
-[Haley] <i> Leaving already? Uh-oh.</i>

39:17.889 --> 39:19.756
Wait, next flight.
Why so quick?

39:19.758 --> 39:21.825
I thought that I would have
some time to look around and...

39:21.827 --> 39:22.926
          [scoffs] Why?

39:22.928 --> 39:25.962
      There's nothing here
      but wide open spaces

39:25.964 --> 39:28.698
  infested with
  wild undomesticated animals,
  and they stink.

39:28.700 --> 39:31.701
  [Haley] <i> I speak</i>
  <i> for all animals when I say,</i>
  <i> that's pretty offensive.</i>

39:31.703 --> 39:34.003
   Wow. It's just been a while
   since I've been back

39:35.474 --> 39:36.906
     and I thought I'd have
     a little time.

39:36.908 --> 39:38.942
See, Ms. Reynolds.
That's exactly the problem.

39:39.444 --> 39:41.644
We do have little time.
[chuckles]

39:42.381 --> 39:46.616
Mr. Andrews runs a tight ship,
and he doesn't allow
for any dillydallying.

39:46.618 --> 39:49.986
 Don't I know it. No time
 to stop and smell the flowers.

39:51.957 --> 39:54.057
  -Isn't that right, Lindsay?
  -[Haley] <i> That's a good idea.</i>

39:54.059 --> 39:56.626
     <i> I think we should stop</i>
     <i> and smell the flowers.</i>

39:56.628 --> 39:58.461
        -Lindsay.
        -[Haley growling]

39:58.463 --> 39:59.963
               Lindsay, what has
               gotten into you?

39:59.965 --> 40:03.833
  -I think she needs to go out.
  -No.
  It'll throw us off schedule.

40:03.835 --> 40:06.469
       We're not stopping.
       Franklyn, continue.

40:07.105 --> 40:09.539
 -[Jessica] Franklyn,
 please stop the car.
-[Leonard] We're not stopping.

40:09.541 --> 40:11.841
     -[Haley] <i> Oh, yeah?</i>
     -Oh. Lindsay, stay away
     from my shoes!

40:11.843 --> 40:14.778
 No. Franklyn, yes, we can stop.
 We can stop right now,
 very briefly.

40:14.780 --> 40:16.146
        Are you serious?

40:16.782 --> 40:18.815
         -Argh.
         -[Haley sighs]

40:18.817 --> 40:20.784
      -[Leonard] It's okay.
      -No, Lindsay. No.

40:20.786 --> 40:22.085
     Oh, disgusting animals.

40:33.498 --> 40:36.966
   Haley, it's your favorite.
   Num Nums.

40:37.803 --> 40:40.603
    [Lindsay]
    <i> Oh, this is disgusting!</i>
    <i> What is this?</i>

40:40.605 --> 40:42.739
What? You love this stuff.

40:42.741 --> 40:44.808
   [Lindsay]
   <i> You're serving me poison.</i>

40:44.810 --> 40:46.810
       <i> I think Haley's</i>
       <i> been humoring you.</i>

40:46.812 --> 40:48.445
Oh, you want some of my stew?

40:48.447 --> 40:51.948
Okay, well, let me
finish cooking it, princess,
then I'll give you some.

40:51.950 --> 40:55.118
    [Lindsay] <i> We need to have</i>
    <i> a serious conversation</i>
    <i> about diet.</i>

41:10.101 --> 41:12.769
  [Haley]
  <i> Oh, boy. I need to</i>
  <i> come up with something fast.</i>

41:14.239 --> 41:15.972
 This better not take too long.

41:15.974 --> 41:20.510
 [Haley]
 <i> I need to find the scent,</i>
 <i> and I need to find the trail.</i>

41:22.714 --> 41:25.582
  Wow. It really is beautiful.

41:27.619 --> 41:29.953
     We don't get
     vistas like this in LA.

41:35.727 --> 41:39.128
[Haley] <i> It's this way.</i>
<i> Time for a little hide-and-see.</i>

41:40.632 --> 41:42.599
Lindsay! Lindsay!

41:42.901 --> 41:44.501
      [Haley chuckles]
      <i> Better come get me!</i>

41:45.136 --> 41:46.669
She's never done this before.

41:46.671 --> 41:50.273
We have really got to get going,
or we are going to
miss the last flight.

41:50.275 --> 41:51.908
I'm not leaving
without my dog.

41:52.978 --> 41:55.044
I'll get her. Lindsay!

41:55.046 --> 41:56.679
     -[Haley] <i> I'm pretending</i>
     <i> to not hear you.</i>
     -Lindsay.

41:56.681 --> 41:58.515
      -Hey, come on.
      -I'm calling Powers.

41:59.651 --> 42:01.751
       Looks like
       we're spending the night.

42:04.956 --> 42:07.824
   [Lindsay]
   <i> This place is disgusting.</i>

42:07.826 --> 42:10.727
     <i> He could use some help</i>
     <i> around here.</i>
     <i> A maid or something.</i>

42:11.930 --> 42:13.196
        [doorbell rings]

42:19.738 --> 42:20.837
                       Surprise!

42:21.540 --> 42:24.107
Yes, it is. Uh...

42:24.643 --> 42:28.044
Sally, it's really great
to see you, always.
But why are you here?

42:28.046 --> 42:31.648
   Well, I thought you could use
   some more supplies
   to make your famous stew.

42:31.917 --> 42:33.683
I'm pretty much all set.

42:34.085 --> 42:35.151
                 Well...

42:35.153 --> 42:38.154
      you know, these bags
      are getting kind of heavy.

42:38.823 --> 42:41.057
Oh, yeah. Let me take those.

42:42.561 --> 42:43.660
Come on in.

42:48.567 --> 42:50.567
   -Hi, Haley. How do I look?
   -[Lindsay growls]

42:50.569 --> 42:52.802
       <i> Like competition.</i>

43:04.182 --> 43:07.917
  [Haley] <i> Peekaboo.</i>
  <i> Come on, Jess, love awaits.</i>

43:08.253 --> 43:10.653
       <i> -Follow me!</i>
       -[Jessica] Lindsay!

43:10.655 --> 43:12.589
      Hey, come on.
      Now is not playtime.

43:12.591 --> 43:13.890
           [Haley giggles]
           <i> Catch me if you can.</i>

43:13.892 --> 43:15.091
Where are you going?
Lindsay. Lindsay!

43:15.093 --> 43:16.659
  [Haley] <i> This is so much fun.</i>

43:16.962 --> 43:18.861
   -Hey! Where are you going?
   <i> -I'm so good at this.</i>

43:18.863 --> 43:20.663
   <i> Follow me and you'll see.</i>

43:23.835 --> 43:24.934
             [sighs]

43:25.070 --> 43:26.836
            [grunts]

43:27.706 --> 43:28.805
Are you serious?

43:34.279 --> 43:36.179
    [Sally Ann] Oh, so that's
    your secret ingredient?

43:36.181 --> 43:38.281
  [Mel] Shh. Can't tell anyone.

43:38.283 --> 43:40.016
   -Or you'll have to kill me.
   -Yeah.

43:40.752 --> 43:42.151
   Put you in one of my stews.

43:42.787 --> 43:44.954
        Call me the demon farmer
        of beef street.

43:44.956 --> 43:46.089
            [laughs]

43:48.193 --> 43:51.127
 -Oh, smells delicious.
 -Mmm. Wait until you taste it.

43:55.033 --> 43:56.132
My lips are ready.

43:56.668 --> 43:58.201
    [Lindsay]
    <i> You better not kiss her.</i>

43:58.203 --> 43:59.969
          <i> Don't do it!</i>

44:00.105 --> 44:03.406
         Ah! Haley!
         What's gotten into you?

44:04.075 --> 44:05.675
         -I am so sorry.
         -[barks]

44:05.677 --> 44:08.011
        Look, she hasn't
        done something like that

44:08.013 --> 44:09.278
          since she was a puppy!

44:09.814 --> 44:11.381
         Or, I don't know,
         maybe that was Lindsay.

44:11.383 --> 44:13.349
Tastes good. You wanna lick?

44:13.852 --> 44:14.984
               Uh...

44:14.986 --> 44:19.255
       Look, you could, uh,
       go upstairs
       and just take off your...

44:20.959 --> 44:23.326
        Put on one of my shirts,
        towel...

44:25.764 --> 44:26.963
            [exhales]

44:27.432 --> 44:28.698
     What is wrong with you?

44:28.700 --> 44:29.766
         [Lindsay] <i> Uh...</i>

44:29.768 --> 44:30.900
       <i> I plead the Fifth.</i>

44:31.202 --> 44:33.670
Lindsay!
What has gotten into you?

44:34.039 --> 44:35.304
Is it the Montana air?

44:38.343 --> 44:39.442
         Wait a minute.

44:40.178 --> 44:41.277
          We're not...

44:45.717 --> 44:46.816
             I don't believe it.

44:47.719 --> 44:49.185
        You found your way home.

44:51.122 --> 44:52.422
    It's like nothing's changed.

44:53.825 --> 44:56.459
      [Haley] <i> That's right.</i>
      <i> You're home again.</i>

44:56.461 --> 44:58.261
       <i> Hopefully forever.</i>

44:58.263 --> 44:59.462
             All right. Come on.

44:59.464 --> 45:02.732
   -We gotta go.
   -[Haley] <i> Hold your horses,</i>
   <i> honey.</i>

45:02.734 --> 45:05.201
    <i> Stay a while. Trust me.</i>

45:05.203 --> 45:06.703
                    [sighs]

45:08.907 --> 45:10.106
          I wonder if he's home.

45:11.776 --> 45:14.410
  I thought
  that you liked Sally Ann, huh?

45:14.979 --> 45:16.279
     What, are you
     getting jealous, girl?

45:16.281 --> 45:18.081
     [Lindsay] <i> Her? Please.</i>

45:18.083 --> 45:20.149
    <i> There is someone better</i>
    <i> out there for you.</i>

45:20.318 --> 45:22.251
      You know, Sally and I
      are just friends.

45:23.021 --> 45:24.053
          Just friends.

45:25.423 --> 45:28.324
  [sighs] I don't know.
  Maybe I should rethink that.

45:29.894 --> 45:31.060
         Face the facts.

45:33.098 --> 45:34.397
   Jess is never coming back.

45:35.400 --> 45:36.499
        Delilah's right.

45:37.402 --> 45:38.968
 I should move on with my life.

45:41.473 --> 45:44.340
   -Right?
   -[Lindsay] <i> Wrong. So wrong.</i>

45:44.776 --> 45:48.144
       Lindsay. Lindsay.
       Hey, get over here.

45:48.480 --> 45:49.779
  Lindsay!

45:50.448 --> 45:52.115
       No, come here. Hey.

45:52.517 --> 45:53.816
                  Come on.

46:10.468 --> 46:13.436
          Well, I guess
          Mel found someone too.

46:13.438 --> 46:16.506
 [Haley] <i> Uh-oh.</i>
 <i> She's not supposed to be here.</i>

46:16.508 --> 46:18.274
   All right, Lindsay. Let's go.

46:19.310 --> 46:21.144
    We don't wanna disturb them,
    do we?

46:21.146 --> 46:23.913
 [Haley] <i> No!</i>
 <i> This is some kind of mistake.</i>

46:23.915 --> 46:27.517
  <i> Sally Ann and Mel</i>
  <i> aren't an item.</i>
  <i> He's still in love with you.</i>

46:27.886 --> 46:29.318
     <i> Trust me on this one.</i>

46:29.854 --> 46:31.154
       All right. Come on, girl.

46:33.191 --> 46:34.290
         [phone ringing]

46:34.292 --> 46:35.391
           Oh, shoot.

46:37.061 --> 46:39.061
 [phone ringing in the distance]

46:43.168 --> 46:44.300
           Hi, Powers.

46:44.302 --> 46:46.002
       Hello? Is that you?

46:46.004 --> 46:47.804
   Hey, what's going on there?

46:47.806 --> 46:50.106
You missed your flight.
Is everything okay, sweetie pie?

46:50.108 --> 46:52.308
 No. Yes. Uh, Lindsay ran away,
 but I found her.

46:52.310 --> 46:53.843
        You don't have
        anything to worry about.

46:53.845 --> 46:55.111
[Lindsay] <i> This is</i>
<i> about to get good.</i>

46:55.113 --> 46:56.445
       Wait, what's that?
       Speak up.

46:56.447 --> 46:58.114
       -I can't hear you.
       -I'm fine.

46:58.116 --> 46:59.448
           I just can't talk
           any louder than this.

46:59.450 --> 47:00.883
     -Let me call you back.
     -Jessica?

47:02.487 --> 47:03.886
              Mel!

47:03.888 --> 47:05.955
  [Haley] <i> This is so exciting!</i>

47:05.957 --> 47:07.256
      Back together again.

47:07.258 --> 47:08.958
You didn't tell me
he had a girlfriend!

47:08.960 --> 47:11.027
    Relax. They're just friends.

47:11.162 --> 47:13.162
 [laughs] Fancy seeing you here.

47:13.164 --> 47:17.133
  [stammers] My home is usually
  a good place to find me. Wh--

47:18.069 --> 47:20.036
       -Why are you here?
       -I'm not here.

47:20.038 --> 47:23.406
      -I mean, I'm here,
      but I'm not staying.
      -Not where?

47:23.408 --> 47:26.142
  <i> -Who? What?</i>
  <i> Where are you? Who is that?</i>
  -Um...

47:26.144 --> 47:27.376
             I'm at Mel's place.

47:27.378 --> 47:29.445
Mel Danberry, your ex-boyfriend?

47:29.914 --> 47:31.447
    -Yes.
    -Who are you talking to?

47:31.449 --> 47:33.082
        -Powers Andrews.
        -Yes?

47:33.084 --> 47:35.518
    -He's my fiancé.
    -What? Mel's your fiancé?

47:35.520 --> 47:37.620
        -No! No, you are.
        -I'm your what?

47:38.189 --> 47:40.022
  -My ex-boyfriend.
  -You're breaking up with me?

47:40.024 --> 47:42.124
     -No, I'm marrying you.
     -What?

47:42.126 --> 47:44.560
     I'm so confused.
     What on earth
     is going on out there?

47:44.562 --> 47:47.430
    <i> -My hands are sweating.</i>
    <i> They never sweat!</i>
    -What's going on here?

47:48.299 --> 47:49.465
     Who's she?

47:49.901 --> 47:51.634
          Well, this is
          not helping our cause.

47:51.636 --> 47:54.036
They were going to kiss.
I had to improvise.

47:54.973 --> 47:57.006
    This is Jessica Reynolds.

47:58.276 --> 47:59.575
I thought you two broke up.

48:00.278 --> 48:01.410
         [both] We did.

48:01.412 --> 48:03.613
  Powers, listen,
  there's nothing going on here.

48:03.615 --> 48:05.314
I'm gonna have to call you back.

48:05.583 --> 48:08.918
      -Hello? Hello? Hello?
      -[phone beeps]

48:09.587 --> 48:10.887
             Oh, no.

48:10.889 --> 48:16.259
    I'm sorry, um...
    I didn't mean to bother you.

48:16.261 --> 48:19.962
            I just...
            happened to be
            in the neighborhood.

48:21.165 --> 48:23.266
      -In the neighborhood.
      -Chasing Lindsay.

48:24.068 --> 48:25.668
        -[barks]
          -Oh, my God.

48:26.437 --> 48:30.573
  Lindsay. Oh, my God, Lindsay.
  Look at you!

48:31.009 --> 48:34.210
     Oh, my God.
     Look how much you've grown.
     [chuckles]

48:34.345 --> 48:36.913
 Yeah, so has Haley. I mean,
 you can barely tell them apart.

48:36.915 --> 48:39.215
  [Lindsay] <i> That's the concept</i>
  <i> in a nutshell.</i>

48:39.217 --> 48:40.950
               Well, it's good
               to see you, girl.

48:40.952 --> 48:42.285
     [Haley] <i> Yeah.</i>
     <i> It's been three hours.</i>

48:42.287 --> 48:43.586
        <i> Missed you too.</i>

48:43.988 --> 48:45.655
      [barks] <i> Talk to Jess.</i>

48:46.925 --> 48:49.959
     So, she ran away,
     what, from Los Angeles?

48:49.961 --> 48:54.530
           No, I'm actually here
           on a publicity tour
           for my new perfume.

48:54.666 --> 48:55.965
              Xtraordinar.

48:56.567 --> 48:57.633
    You sure are.

48:57.635 --> 49:01.304
     [Haley] <i> I knew it!</i>
     <i> The flame still burns.</i>

49:01.306 --> 49:03.072
    [Lindsay] <i> We're geniuses.</i>

49:04.108 --> 49:05.274
   Would you like to come in?

49:05.276 --> 49:07.376
      No, I don't wanna intrude.

49:07.378 --> 49:11.213
   Besides, it looks like you've
   got your hands full.

49:12.183 --> 49:15.284
Oh, Mel and I were just cooking
and I got all wet.

49:16.955 --> 49:18.020
          You don't say.

49:19.624 --> 49:21.958
    -[Lindsay] <i> She did not</i>
     <i> just say that.</i>
     -[Jessica] Um...

49:22.727 --> 49:25.294
           Why don't you just
           point me to the road?

49:25.630 --> 49:26.696
    Where's your car?

49:27.332 --> 49:28.965
            My limo? Um...

49:30.568 --> 49:32.234
      I think
      it's back there somewhere.

49:34.072 --> 49:37.540
     -Come on, Lindsay.
     -[Lindsay] <i> I'm not</i>
     <i> going anywhere, Jess.</i>

49:38.009 --> 49:39.241
   Where you staying?

49:39.243 --> 49:43.145
 I don't know.
 I'm sure my assistant, Leonard,
 will find me a place.

49:44.315 --> 49:45.414
          Come inside.

49:46.651 --> 49:48.150
     Come on, five minutes.

49:51.589 --> 49:52.722
                [sighs]

50:01.099 --> 50:02.598
   [Lindsay]
   <i> So, we got them together.</i>

50:02.600 --> 50:04.433
      <i> Now how do we</i>
      <i> keep them together?</i>

50:04.435 --> 50:07.036
      [Haley] <i> Don't worry.</i>
      <i> Love is in the air.</i>

50:07.038 --> 50:11.273
     [Lindsay] <i> Really?</i>
     <i> All I smell is perfume</i>
     <i> and beef stew.</i>

50:20.184 --> 50:22.651
         Leonard! Oh...

50:22.653 --> 50:25.421
   I am bitterly disappointed
   in you.

50:25.423 --> 50:27.757
     Jess is supposed to be
     on a plane right now.

50:27.759 --> 50:30.326
 And you know where she is? Huh?
 You know where she is?

50:30.328 --> 50:33.329
    You know where she is?
    She is at
    her ex-boyfriend's house!

50:33.331 --> 50:35.464
   [Leonard]
   <i> I will have her on a plane</i>
   <i> first thing tomorrow, sir.</i>

50:35.466 --> 50:38.601
   Oh, you better! Because
   the buyers tracking report
   says that

50:38.603 --> 50:41.437
   Xtraordinar is going to be
   a huge success!

50:41.439 --> 50:43.572
   Which means Jess
   is going to be filthy rich,

50:43.574 --> 50:46.108
  which means
  I am going to be filthy rich
  when we are married.

50:46.110 --> 50:48.277
     And nothing is going to
     get in the way of that.

50:48.279 --> 50:49.745
  Not some rabid ex-boyfriend,

50:49.747 --> 50:52.181
    and certainly not
    that flea-ridden dirtbag

50:52.183 --> 50:53.549
      that she calls a dog!

50:54.452 --> 50:55.618
              Argh!

50:56.421 --> 50:58.120
       [sighs] Okay, okay.

50:59.424 --> 51:01.323
   [exhales] Breathe and calm.

51:02.226 --> 51:03.492
       You are in control.

51:05.096 --> 51:06.796
   You are in control of this.

51:08.132 --> 51:09.832
    The world is your oyster.

51:12.170 --> 51:15.071
    Lauren, get me
    a ticket to Montana! Now!

51:16.674 --> 51:18.741
           Ah... So...

51:20.611 --> 51:23.446
Publicity tour, a limo...

51:24.482 --> 51:27.450
personal assistant,
a new fiancé.

51:28.453 --> 51:31.687
Well, you've done well
for yourself.

51:32.690 --> 51:33.856
              Living my LA life.

51:33.858 --> 51:35.224
         [both chuckle]

51:35.726 --> 51:37.126
That's wonderful.

51:39.097 --> 51:40.196
    You look great.

51:41.199 --> 51:43.132
And you seem happy.

51:44.135 --> 51:46.235
         [phone ringing]

51:51.576 --> 51:54.810
  -You don't need to get that?
  -Uh, no, it can wait. Um...

51:56.714 --> 52:00.182
        Yeah, I mean, city life,
        you know, can be
        a little overwhelming

52:00.184 --> 52:02.485
        but I mean,
        I really can't complain.

52:04.555 --> 52:05.654
                   So...

52:07.258 --> 52:08.357
                  how 'bout you?

52:09.694 --> 52:12.328
        -Sally Ann, huh?
        -Yeah.

52:12.830 --> 52:14.296
Yeah, she's great.

52:14.298 --> 52:17.466
She runs
the grocery store downtown.

52:18.536 --> 52:19.835
 So, it's business and pleasure.

52:20.805 --> 52:21.871
            Yeah.

52:22.540 --> 52:24.206
Yeah, I guess
you could say that.

52:25.710 --> 52:27.877
    [Haley]
    <i> Why aren't they kissing?</i>

52:27.879 --> 52:30.679
    -[Lindsay] <i> Here comes</i>
    <i> one of the reasons.</i>
    -Hey, I should get going.

52:30.681 --> 52:32.848
  Looks like you guys have
  some catching up to do, so...

52:32.850 --> 52:35.417
            Oh, nonsense.
            I'm really the one
            who should be going.

52:35.419 --> 52:37.686
   [Haley] <i> No! Absolutely not!</i>

52:37.688 --> 52:39.488
     And you know what they say.

52:39.490 --> 52:42.224
   -Two's company, but...
   -Three's a ménage a trois.

52:42.527 --> 52:43.692
  [Haley] <i> I don't speak French.</i>

52:43.694 --> 52:45.427
        [Lindsay] <i> Crowd.</i>

52:45.429 --> 52:46.629
  <i> I think</i>
  <i> it means "crowd" in French.</i>

52:47.899 --> 52:49.899
          I'm gonna call Leonard
          to pick me up.

52:49.901 --> 52:53.269
No. No, no.
Don't be silly, okay?
Look, I will take you to town.

52:53.571 --> 52:55.404
        -Let me just go
        put my stew away.
        -[sighs]

52:57.808 --> 52:59.408
                Gravy.

52:59.911 --> 53:01.210
             Uh-huh.

53:01.846 --> 53:03.712
        [Haley] <i> What now?</i>

53:03.714 --> 53:05.481
       [Lindsay]
       <i> Mel and Jess need</i>

53:05.483 --> 53:06.782
     <i> some alone time</i>
     <i> together. That's what.</i>

53:13.591 --> 53:15.958
You know,
I could give Jessica
a ride back to town.

53:16.494 --> 53:20.196
   -It's no bother.
   -No, listen,
   you've done enough, Sally.

53:20.598 --> 53:25.701
  Thank you. Besides,
  looks like Haley and Lindsay
  are inseparable again.

53:25.703 --> 53:27.436
      Just like old times.

53:28.506 --> 53:29.638
                     It is.

53:29.640 --> 53:33.809
Okay, well, I'll see you
at the fair tomorrow
when you take first prize.

53:34.445 --> 53:35.945
I've got the gravy stains
to prove it.

53:43.321 --> 53:45.221
    [Lindsay] They just need
    more time together.

53:46.490 --> 53:50.793
 So, let me just fix this truck.

53:52.630 --> 53:54.930
     -What's that gonna do?
     -You'll see.

53:54.932 --> 53:59.668
  Just let me get this in here
  a little bit.

53:59.971 --> 54:02.471
       -This better work.
       -It will. Trust me.

54:02.473 --> 54:04.873
     I guess
     I don't have a choice,
     do I?

54:05.409 --> 54:06.508
       That should do it.

54:07.478 --> 54:09.678
       -[car honking]
       -Gravy stains, huh?

54:11.382 --> 54:13.315
     It's actually a funny story
     with that one.

54:14.285 --> 54:15.384
          I bet.

54:15.386 --> 54:17.786
Why don't you tell me
on the ride back to town?

54:18.889 --> 54:19.989
                           Okay.

54:32.970 --> 54:34.670
    Are you taking the back road
    into town?

54:35.439 --> 54:36.672
     It's quicker.

54:37.642 --> 54:39.708
        Oh, so you're
        trying to get rid of me?

54:39.710 --> 54:42.278
[laughs] No. No, no.

54:42.413 --> 54:43.746
No, that's not it. I--

54:46.284 --> 54:48.751
I thought maybe
you might be in a hurry,
so I...

54:49.687 --> 54:50.786
                    I'm kidding.

54:52.523 --> 54:56.925
    Besides,
       I wouldn't blame you.
       I did show up unexpected.

54:56.927 --> 55:00.462
[laughing] Yeah.
Yes, that was
definitely a surprise.

55:00.698 --> 55:03.632
And it was not
an unpleasant surprise.

55:05.303 --> 55:07.770
        Well, you were always,
        like, full of surprises.

55:08.739 --> 55:11.707
       I thought I would
       just try it for a change.

55:14.312 --> 55:15.477
What the...

55:16.647 --> 55:19.615
No, no, no.
No, not now, no!

55:20.451 --> 55:21.550
                      What?

55:24.488 --> 55:25.754
     You've gotta be kidding me.

55:30.328 --> 55:32.428
           [coughing]

55:34.465 --> 55:37.499
     Oh, God.
     I think we threw a rod.

55:37.802 --> 55:40.436
    I don't understand.
    This truck's never
    given me any trouble before.

55:40.838 --> 55:42.438
Well, can you fix it?

55:42.440 --> 55:45.040
      [Mel] No.
      This isn't going anywhere.

55:46.077 --> 55:48.944
Okay. Well, I'll just call
the local gas station.
Do you know the numb--

55:49.980 --> 55:52.481
Minor problem. No reception.

55:53.784 --> 55:55.384
   -Do you have a cell phone?
   -Nope.

55:55.986 --> 55:58.854
     Well, as you know,
    don't really work out here.

55:58.856 --> 56:01.924
         Plus, I'm not a big fan
         of being on call 24/7.

56:01.926 --> 56:03.926
[Jessica chuckles]
Yeah, I remember.

56:04.695 --> 56:08.130
All right.
So, what do we do? Walk?

56:09.133 --> 56:11.400
         Well, it's probably
         about 20 miles to town.

56:12.403 --> 56:14.503
            And ten miles
               back to my place.

56:15.973 --> 56:18.907
          But I do have
          some camping equipment
          in the back.

56:21.011 --> 56:22.845
I'm hungry.
What are we gonna eat?

56:23.414 --> 56:24.646
      How do you like your eggs?

56:24.648 --> 56:28.117
     -Raw? I--
     -Scrambled, over-easy,
     sunny-side up?

56:34.925 --> 56:36.925
 [Haley] <i> Let's leave these two</i>
 <i> alone for a bit.</i>

56:39.397 --> 56:40.496
               It's pretty good.

56:42.733 --> 56:44.867
All without the help of takeout.

56:52.510 --> 56:54.176
  You should try my beef stew.

56:56.046 --> 56:57.546
  Best beef stew in the county.

56:59.850 --> 57:00.949
          I believe it.

57:05.423 --> 57:09.158
     I've made improvements,
     you know.

57:13.831 --> 57:14.930
           I can tell.

57:18.436 --> 57:21.603
      So, what about
      this, um, Powers guy?

57:22.706 --> 57:24.940
      Huh?
      Does he cook for you?

57:25.643 --> 57:27.876
  [Jessica]
  I wouldn't exactly call Powers
  the hands-on type.

57:29.780 --> 57:31.613
       Unless it comes
       to money contracts.

57:33.717 --> 57:35.184
        But I don't wanna
        talk about him.

57:40.491 --> 57:42.858
  Can't remember the last time
  I went camping like this.

57:45.529 --> 57:47.763
         June 10, 2012.

57:50.768 --> 57:52.501
We were coming back
from your mom's.

57:54.738 --> 57:59.675
We got home and found that
an army of cats
had taken over our place.

57:59.877 --> 58:02.211
And turned it into their own
personal litter box.

58:02.213 --> 58:04.847
         [both laughing]

58:04.849 --> 58:06.515
               Took a whole week
               to fumigate.

58:06.517 --> 58:08.884
           Insert cat joke here.

58:09.487 --> 58:12.187
Well, so we went
on that camping trip.

58:13.624 --> 58:15.257
I really hope they kiss soon.

58:15.259 --> 58:16.792
                   Yeah, me too.

58:17.228 --> 58:18.760
    You remember the exact date?

58:21.732 --> 58:24.900
No, no.
I just made it up.
I made it up.

58:25.736 --> 58:27.069
Thought it might impress you.

58:30.774 --> 58:31.940
           Trying to impress me.

58:33.911 --> 58:35.010
                        Why?

58:38.983 --> 58:40.148
          Look at you.

58:41.118 --> 58:42.851
You're this big city girl.

58:44.021 --> 58:47.623
You come back and visit
your old country boyfriend.

58:48.225 --> 58:51.927
      [chuckles] Come on.
      How am I supposed to
      compete with that?

58:53.097 --> 58:54.930
Compete with that whole
LA lifestyle.

58:56.100 --> 58:57.699
         There's no competition.

58:58.269 --> 59:00.669
   [clears throat]
   Two totally different worlds.

59:01.272 --> 59:03.572
I think I prefer this place.

59:04.008 --> 59:05.874
     Don't have
     skies like this in LA.

59:05.876 --> 59:08.744
       We live in a condo.
       What's a sky?

59:09.680 --> 59:10.779
            [Mel] LA.

59:11.615 --> 59:12.714
        Must be exciting.

59:14.585 --> 59:15.984
          It gets old sometimes.

59:17.621 --> 59:18.720
      This gets old.

59:19.890 --> 59:21.056
                [Jessica laughs]

59:21.759 --> 59:23.025
       This is beautiful.

59:26.297 --> 59:29.698
It sure is beautiful.
Now kiss! Come on!

59:30.768 --> 59:33.101
   It's almost like you planned
   for your truck to break down.

59:35.139 --> 59:37.306
Yeah. I planned
this whole thing.

59:38.609 --> 59:40.108
Planned for my truck
to break down.

59:41.278 --> 59:43.312
Then you must have planned
for no cell service.

59:46.884 --> 59:51.353
Uh-oh. I think they're onto us.
Let's give the lovebirds
some privacy.

59:55.826 --> 59:57.125
           [both] No.

59:58.195 --> 59:59.294
      No.

01:00:00.965 --> 01:00:02.097
                   Oh.

01:00:02.099 --> 01:00:03.632
You can use the sleeping bag.

01:00:04.902 --> 01:00:06.001
             There's only one.

01:00:06.604 --> 01:00:07.903
I usually only need one.

01:00:08.739 --> 01:00:10.105
         For you and...

01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:13.842
            Ms. Gravy Stains?

01:00:15.713 --> 01:00:17.879
There's nothing
between Sally Ann and I.

01:00:22.286 --> 01:00:24.319
You said you don't want
to talk about Powers.

01:00:25.255 --> 01:00:27.322
I don't want
to talk about Sally Ann.

01:00:27.324 --> 01:00:28.624
      Deal?

01:00:29.893 --> 01:00:31.026
                    Fair enough.

01:00:56.854 --> 01:00:58.120
To be even more fair...

01:00:59.890 --> 01:01:03.225
If you promise
to behave yourself,

01:01:04.828 --> 01:01:06.662
I'll let you share
the sleeping bag with me.

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:10.899
                       I'm good.

01:01:12.136 --> 01:01:13.235
[scoffs]

01:01:14.905 --> 01:01:18.006
You're chilly.
Stop acting stupid.

01:01:18.142 --> 01:01:19.241
                             Oh.

01:01:20.344 --> 01:01:22.444
    So, now you're calling me
       stupid, huh?

01:01:22.446 --> 01:01:24.780
Yeah.
Only when you act stupid.

01:01:27.151 --> 01:01:30.285
             Now I remember
             why we split up
             in the first place.

01:01:30.287 --> 01:01:31.853
Oh, you're just now
remembering that?

01:01:31.855 --> 01:01:32.954
                         Uh-huh.

01:01:33.791 --> 01:01:34.890
                   You're funny.

01:01:37.461 --> 01:01:38.760
     It's a gift.

01:01:43.367 --> 01:01:44.466
                  If you say so.

01:01:48.005 --> 01:01:49.204
I always say so.

01:01:53.911 --> 01:01:55.210
[clears throat]

01:02:07.458 --> 01:02:08.757
                      Move over.

01:02:10.894 --> 01:02:12.327
         [both grunting]

01:02:12.329 --> 01:02:16.765
    Let me just get in a little.
    Can you move over?

01:02:17.468 --> 01:02:18.867
            -[grunts]
            -Okay.

01:02:19.803 --> 01:02:21.503
        -Okay.
        -[both giggling]

01:02:30.881 --> 01:02:31.947
       Did you check for snakes?

01:02:31.949 --> 01:02:33.749
        [laughs]

01:02:35.886 --> 01:02:37.052
                 Oh...

01:02:44.428 --> 01:02:45.794
                   Are you okay?

01:02:48.432 --> 01:02:49.531
       I'm perfect.

01:02:52.903 --> 01:02:54.970
     Look, they're together.

01:02:54.972 --> 01:02:57.172
       Let's make sure
       they stay together.

01:02:59.143 --> 01:03:01.143
        -[zipper closing]
        -Be careful!

01:03:01.545 --> 01:03:04.279
           [Lindsay]
           I've got this. Relax.

01:03:25.002 --> 01:03:27.836
 Yo! Any word from Ms. Reynolds?

01:03:27.838 --> 01:03:29.871
       I checked
       the Danberry ranch. Nada.

01:03:29.873 --> 01:03:31.907
I called her
27 times last night.

01:03:31.909 --> 01:03:34.042
She didn't call me back
and didn't answer.
She didn't do anything.

01:03:34.044 --> 01:03:36.578
I know she's dead.
I'm gonna lose my job again
just like in Milan.

01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:40.248
She was probably abducted
by some
militia lumberjack organization

01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:41.416
and now I'm going
to lose my job.

01:03:41.418 --> 01:03:42.484
         [phone ringing]

01:03:42.486 --> 01:03:44.052
I've got to take this.

01:03:45.222 --> 01:03:46.922
[exhales sharply] Jessica!

01:03:46.924 --> 01:03:49.057
      Oh. You still haven't
      found her, have you?

01:03:49.059 --> 01:03:51.293
   Not-- not yet, Mr. Andrews.

01:03:51.295 --> 01:03:53.929
  -All right. Well, pick me up.
  -[chuckles] <i> Physically?</i>

01:03:53.931 --> 01:03:56.131
I don't think
I'm strong enough for that, sir.

01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:58.867
       No. No, no, no.
       I'm at the airport.

01:03:58.869 --> 01:04:00.402
   Or at least
   what they call an airport.

01:04:00.404 --> 01:04:01.970
      It's more like a barn
      surrounded by planes.

01:04:01.972 --> 01:04:03.038
       But I just arrived.

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:04.406
              You're in Montana?

01:04:04.408 --> 01:04:06.374
    Yes, I took the red-eye.
    I'm exhausted.

01:04:06.376 --> 01:04:08.109
     Please hurry.
     I do not like to wait.

01:04:09.613 --> 01:04:11.379
      To the airport, fast.

01:04:12.916 --> 01:04:14.015
                           Wait!

01:04:16.286 --> 01:04:18.086
  I'm supposed to be in the car.

01:04:38.408 --> 01:04:41.576
             Aw. So cute.
             They look so happy.

01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:46.014
    Why did they break up?
    Mel never talks about it.

01:04:46.350 --> 01:04:50.318
      Had something to do
      with her job,
      his dream, the house,

01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:53.421
but I think
she's been longing for a change.

01:04:56.326 --> 01:04:58.026
              [snorts]

01:04:58.028 --> 01:04:59.160
      Oh...

01:05:00.430 --> 01:05:01.897
            Morning.

01:05:01.899 --> 01:05:04.165
Uh, yeah, good morning.

01:05:04.167 --> 01:05:05.967
                Yeah. [grunting]

01:05:05.969 --> 01:05:07.969
It's a little snug in here,
don't you think?

01:05:07.971 --> 01:05:10.171
               Yeah,
               it's a one-person
               sleeping bag.

01:05:10.173 --> 01:05:12.307
       -[straining] Okay.
       -Okay.

01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:14.109
             Let me see if I can
             get the zipper...

01:05:14.111 --> 01:05:15.410
               Okay, it's not...

01:05:15.412 --> 01:05:17.078
           What is it?

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:20.048
    It's not going.
    I think it's... It's broken.

01:05:20.050 --> 01:05:22.183
      -Very funny, Mel.
      -No, I'm not joking.

01:05:22.185 --> 01:05:23.952
Oh. Come on.

01:05:23.954 --> 01:05:26.688
    -You've got to
    get me out of this thing.
    -I can't.

01:05:26.690 --> 01:05:29.024
       Okay, hair is everywhere.
       Everywhere!

01:05:29.026 --> 01:05:31.626
-Well, yeah. That's because it's
attached to my head.
-No, and in my face.

01:05:31.628 --> 01:05:34.663
Okay, well,
maybe if you didn't have such
big, stupid broad shoulders,

01:05:34.665 --> 01:05:36.531
maybe you'd get out
of this thing by now.

01:05:36.533 --> 01:05:38.500
-Oh, nice, nice.
So, now I have stupid shoulders?
-Uh-huh.

01:05:38.502 --> 01:05:40.101
          -Yeah.
          -Yeah, nice.

01:05:40.103 --> 01:05:42.203
 -Okay.
 -Why'd you zip us in so tight?

01:05:42.205 --> 01:05:43.471
                 Look, I didn't.

01:05:43.473 --> 01:05:45.373
Yeah, then who did?
What, the dogs?

01:05:46.543 --> 01:05:48.710
   [Lindsay] <i> I don't know</i>
   <i> what you're talking about.</i>

01:05:49.579 --> 01:05:51.446
        -[both sigh]
          -Okay, look.

01:05:51.448 --> 01:05:53.415
  Listen, I got a pocketknife,
  but I can't reach it...

01:05:53.417 --> 01:05:55.317
  -Okay.
  -...so just,
  you give me a reach-around--

01:05:55.319 --> 01:05:57.385
Oh, no, I am not
giving you a reach-around.

01:05:58.522 --> 01:06:00.355
    -All right. Let's sit up.
    -Okay.

01:06:00.357 --> 01:06:01.957
        -One, two, three.
        -One, two...

01:06:01.959 --> 01:06:04.125
        -[grunting] Okay.
        -Okay, all right.

01:06:04.127 --> 01:06:05.660
    -All right, let's just...
    -We just got to stand up.

01:06:05.662 --> 01:06:07.329
 -Yeah. Okay, ready? And stand.
 -Wait.

01:06:07.331 --> 01:06:08.663
           [grunting]

01:06:08.665 --> 01:06:10.598
          -Oh, my God!
          -[laughs]

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:13.168
     -Okay, yeah.
     -Okay. Okay, now what,
     smart guy?

01:06:13.170 --> 01:06:16.705
        This isn't what I meant
        when I said
        let's get them together.

01:06:16.707 --> 01:06:18.606
  But I'm kinda enjoying this.

01:06:18.608 --> 01:06:20.575
       -[Jessica screams]
       -[both grunt]

01:06:22.279 --> 01:06:23.678
                   Are you okay?

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:25.447
      -Are you okay?
      -[laughing] I'm okay.

01:06:25.449 --> 01:06:27.582
Oh, no. What did you do?

01:06:28.485 --> 01:06:31.753
     Are they okay?
     You're taking the blame
     for this one.

01:06:32.189 --> 01:06:33.588
    That's all right with me.

01:06:34.291 --> 01:06:35.557
        -[both laughing]
        -Oh, my gosh.

01:06:35.559 --> 01:06:37.058
That was terrible.

01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:38.426
      Ah.
      That's one way to wake up.

01:06:39.296 --> 01:06:40.762
     -Let's get out of here.
     -All right.

01:06:40.764 --> 01:06:43.031
   -Come on.
   -Come on, girls. Let's go.

01:06:43.533 --> 01:06:44.599
                       Let's go.

01:06:59.082 --> 01:07:00.582
     -[horns blaring]
     -Yo, hey. Hey, come on!

01:07:00.584 --> 01:07:03.184
      Pass the one on the right.
      Come on!

01:07:05.422 --> 01:07:08.023
    Where do you mountain people
    learn how to drive?

01:07:19.136 --> 01:07:24.739
    [Haley] So nice out here.
    If this isn't romantic,
    I don't know what is.

01:07:24.741 --> 01:07:28.410
   [Lindsay panting excitedly]
   I've never had so much fun
   in my life.

01:07:28.412 --> 01:07:30.178
          Wait for me!

01:07:31.314 --> 01:07:34.716
         So, when's the big day?
         The wedding?

01:07:36.286 --> 01:07:37.786
       Oh, right.

01:07:39.256 --> 01:07:40.388
           Um...

01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:45.093
When I get back.
Powers has the whole thing
planned out.

01:07:46.363 --> 01:07:49.297
       Really?
       He must be quite the guy.

01:07:52.335 --> 01:07:54.536
      -What does that mean?
      -I don't know.

01:07:54.538 --> 01:07:57.272
     You're letting someone
     plan out your life for you.

01:07:59.076 --> 01:08:00.542
            Just doesn't
            seem like you, Jess.

01:08:02.279 --> 01:08:05.213
Well, look, like I said,
you know,
the city is different.

01:08:06.550 --> 01:08:09.117
And everything's faster.
Sometimes I just
don't have time.

01:08:09.119 --> 01:08:10.218
                 To breathe?

01:08:10.387 --> 01:08:11.686
                 [chuckles]

01:08:14.291 --> 01:08:19.426
Or think.
It's just rush, rush, rush.

01:08:20.397 --> 01:08:22.296
            Hence the assistant.

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:25.817
      [laughs]

01:08:25.818 --> 01:08:27.835
Leonard is probably
freaking out right now.

01:08:29.106 --> 01:08:30.604
He has no idea where I am.

01:08:33.443 --> 01:08:34.542
    Neither do I.

01:08:35.845 --> 01:08:37.212
         That makes three of us.

01:08:38.814 --> 01:08:41.149
       -I thought you said
       you knew where we--
       -Relax.

01:08:41.751 --> 01:08:43.318
    I know exactly where we are.

01:08:44.154 --> 01:08:46.254
            [barking]

01:08:47.691 --> 01:08:51.126
     Hey, looks like Ol' Glory
     got out of her stall again.

01:08:51.495 --> 01:08:54.162
Ol' Glory? Jim Parker's horse.

01:08:54.531 --> 01:08:56.698
          You got a good memory.
          You tired of walking?

01:08:57.567 --> 01:09:00.535
    -Oh, no,
    we can't take Ol' Glory.
    -Borrow, borrow.

01:09:00.737 --> 01:09:03.470
       Besides, Jim will be glad
       if we bring her back.

      [marching band music]

01:09:17.287 --> 01:09:19.854
  We will find her, Mr. Andrews.
  Rest assured of that.

01:09:20.423 --> 01:09:23.858
I'm not
rest assured of anything,
Leonard. Nothing. Ah.

01:09:25.629 --> 01:09:26.928
What is going on around here?

01:09:27.564 --> 01:09:28.696
                   I don't know.

01:09:28.698 --> 01:09:30.698
Uh, it's the annual county fair.

01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:35.403
   You know, uh,
   pie eating contests, rodeo,

01:09:35.404 --> 01:09:38.206
    pig slapping,
    who's got the nicer cow.

01:09:38.207 --> 01:09:41.209
       Bunch of ranch folk
       walking around.
       The usual.

01:09:41.611 --> 01:09:44.444
     I've got a gut feeling
     that Ms. Reynolds is there.

01:09:45.282 --> 01:09:47.881
   [sighs] Looks like
   a caveman disco out there.

01:09:47.884 --> 01:09:49.716
All right,
I guess we'll check it out.

01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:52.220
          -Franklyn...
          -[sighs]

01:09:52.488 --> 01:09:53.587
           You got it.

01:10:01.765 --> 01:10:02.597
Hey. Hey, girl.

01:10:07.704 --> 01:10:12.707
 Good to see you.
 Yeah, you up for a little ride?
 Huh?

01:10:16.913 --> 01:10:20.448
            -[grunts]
            -[neighs]

01:10:20.450 --> 01:10:21.883
             All right. Come on.

01:10:21.885 --> 01:10:24.586
      What did I tell you?
      This guy's a stud.

01:10:24.588 --> 01:10:27.222
    This is
    definitely going to work.

01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:37.799
              Whoa.

01:10:38.702 --> 01:10:39.801
    You remember how to ride?

01:10:39.803 --> 01:10:43.905
   It's like riding a bicycle.
Only bigger and an animal.

01:10:45.542 --> 01:10:46.674
             Well...

01:10:49.913 --> 01:10:51.379
           -Ready? Up.
           -Yep.

01:10:53.416 --> 01:10:55.650
         -There you go.
         -[laughs]

01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:58.686
I guess we'll get you
back to town.

01:11:00.290 --> 01:11:01.456
           Isn't the fair today?

01:11:02.325 --> 01:11:03.591
          Yeah.

01:11:04.261 --> 01:11:06.394
                Don't you need
                to get your stew
                for the contest?

01:11:08.331 --> 01:11:09.998
I figured you need
to be getting back.

01:11:12.502 --> 01:11:13.601
               I have some time.

01:11:16.373 --> 01:11:18.906
      My place it is then.
      [clicks tongue] Hup.

    I don't see her anywhere.

01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:13.755
Oh, maybe she knows.
That's an old friend
of Ms. Reynolds.

01:13:13.757 --> 01:13:15.423
    You found a forever home.

        do you remember us?
        -Mm-hmm.

01:13:33.576 --> 01:13:36.144
     I can't say that I do.
     No, 'cause I don't.

01:13:36.479 --> 01:13:40.148
Um, we came by yesterday
with Jessica Reynolds
to collect her dog.

01:13:40.683 --> 01:13:41.949
Have you seen her?

01:13:41.951 --> 01:13:46.020
  -The dog or the girl?
  -The girl.
  We don't care about the dog.

01:13:46.022 --> 01:13:49.424
Yes, I saw her yesterday.
I saw her
with you two yesterday.

01:13:49.426 --> 01:13:52.059
     -Since yesterday?
     -Since yesterday, what?

01:13:52.061 --> 01:13:53.728
    -Have you seen the girl?
    -Yeah.

01:13:53.730 --> 01:13:55.530
       -Oh.
       -Getting somewhere.

01:13:55.532 --> 01:13:56.964
           -When?
           -Yesterday.

We're talking about today.

01:14:00.637 --> 01:14:02.770
       Well, why did you
       bring up yesterday?

01:14:02.772 --> 01:14:04.839
  I mean,
  are you trying to confuse me?

01:14:04.841 --> 01:14:08.676
        Oh, no, no. It's just...
        That seems far too easy.

     No, what we're trying to do
     is find my fiancée.

     She's blonde, gorgeous.

             -Yes!
             -When?

01:14:18.121 --> 01:14:19.554
           -Yesterday.
           -Yesterday!

01:14:19.556 --> 01:14:21.022

01:14:21.024 --> 01:14:23.057
      -Yes, you got it.
      -Round up the troops.

 seem to be enjoying themselves.

01:14:55.959 --> 01:14:57.525
      They're not the only ones.

01:14:58.761 --> 01:15:00.228
     You could've come back,
     you know.

01:15:02.799 --> 01:15:04.565
     You could've come after me.

01:15:05.969 --> 01:15:07.602
Look, the past
is the past, right?

01:15:09.038 --> 01:15:10.538
No point in living there.

01:15:13.042 --> 01:15:14.175
         If you say so.

01:15:19.949 --> 01:15:21.916
   You should be able
   to call your assistant now.

01:15:22.752 --> 01:15:25.086
           I'm gonna get my stew
           and I'll take you
           back into town.

01:15:25.922 --> 01:15:27.588
             I got another truck
             by the barn.

01:15:54.651 --> 01:15:55.850
       Now you're hungry.

01:15:55.852 --> 01:15:57.151
      [Haley] <i> I'm always hungry.</i>

01:15:57.620 --> 01:15:59.053

  <i> How can you eat that stuff?</i>

     [Haley] <i> Easily. Watch.</i>

01:16:04.227 --> 01:16:06.694

       <i> I'm you, remember?</i>

01:16:14.804 --> 01:16:16.337
          [Haley] <i> Oops.</i>

01:16:16.339 --> 01:16:17.972
  [Jessica] Hey,
  is Lindsay in there with you?

01:16:17.974 --> 01:16:19.707

    [laughs] Okay,
    this is gonna sound crazy...

01:16:28.217 --> 01:16:32.186
      but I think--
      I think our little puppies
      are playing a trick on us.

01:16:32.655 --> 01:16:35.122

Okay, what do you mean?

01:16:35.124 --> 01:16:37.658

           at Delilah's dog park
           yesterday?

01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:39.594
Yeah, for a few hours.
How did you know that?

01:16:39.596 --> 01:16:41.095
            Haley was there too.

01:16:42.065 --> 01:16:45.199
     They switched places.
     Their collars got switched.

    <i> we didn't mean any harm.</i>

01:16:50.006 --> 01:16:51.205
                  Watch.

01:16:53.109 --> 01:16:55.042
                     Haley.

01:16:55.044 --> 01:16:56.277
            -Lindsay.
            <i> -Yeah.</i>

            -[laughs]
            -Hmm?

01:16:58.748 --> 01:17:01.248
           Okay. So...

01:17:02.018 --> 01:17:06.220
     So, you're Haley
     and that's how you knew
     how to get back here.

01:17:06.723 --> 01:17:10.658
 And you're Lindsay
 and that's why you spilled stew
 on Sally Ann last night.

01:17:13.196 --> 01:17:17.064
[scoffs] What if
my truck breaking down
was not an accident?

01:17:17.066 --> 01:17:19.967
And what,
the sleeping bag incident was...

01:17:22.005 --> 01:17:25.272
   [Haley] <i> I think it's time</i>
   <i> to make an exit. Let's go.</i>

01:17:26.009 --> 01:17:28.075
     -Haley!
    -Hey, Lindsay, come on!

01:17:29.178 --> 01:17:30.344
  [Haley] <i> Come on, let's hide.</i>

01:17:34.884 --> 01:17:36.150
       [Jessica] So,
       which dog is which?

01:17:37.086 --> 01:17:38.786
            -Haley!
            -Lindsay!

01:17:38.788 --> 01:17:40.221
          [both] <i> What?</i>

01:17:40.223 --> 01:17:42.390
  -[laughs]
  -Ah. Well, nice try, ladies.

     [Haley] <i> The jig is up.</i>

01:17:46.396 --> 01:17:49.030
   -[Jessica] There you go.
   -[Mel] I missed you. Yeah.

           [both sigh]

01:17:51.234 --> 01:17:53.701
Well, it's getting late.
We should go.

         [girl singing]

01:18:24.033 --> 01:18:27.334
So, you're gonna stick around
for the contest
or you taking off right away?

01:18:27.336 --> 01:18:29.870
        Uh... I probably have to
        take off pretty quickly

01:18:29.872 --> 01:18:32.239
             after we figure out
             which dog is mine.

01:18:32.241 --> 01:18:35.109
   -Haley!
   -[Haley] <i> You figured it out</i>
   <i> already.</i>

01:18:35.111 --> 01:18:37.211
     Oh, there she is. Let's go.

01:18:38.081 --> 01:18:41.182
     Ms. Reynolds, we have been
     looking everywhere for you.

01:18:41.184 --> 01:18:43.818
          You know,
          I'm so sorry, Leonard.
          I got sidetracked.

01:18:43.820 --> 01:18:45.753
     No, no, it's my fault.
     It's my fault.

01:18:45.755 --> 01:18:47.388
   I take full responsibility
   for it.

01:18:47.390 --> 01:18:49.757
  Uh... You don't need
  to take responsibility for it.

01:18:49.759 --> 01:18:53.294
    I believe that we were pawns
    in a sinister game
    of manipulation.

01:18:53.296 --> 01:18:56.197
-[Haley] <i> These guys are trouble.</i>
-[Lindsay] <i> Don't listen to them.</i>

01:18:56.399 --> 01:18:59.934
      -Jessie! [chuckles]
      -Oh, my God. Powers,

01:18:59.936 --> 01:19:02.203
  I didn't think that you would
  fly all the way out here to--

01:19:02.205 --> 01:19:03.838
To the armpit of America?

01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:08.943
Well, when my star attraction
and the love of my life
goes missing,

01:19:08.945 --> 01:19:10.211
I leave no stone unturned.

01:19:10.213 --> 01:19:12.513
      This guy's the worst.

01:19:13.916 --> 01:19:20.020
-[clears throat]
-Oh, um... Powers, um,
this is Mel, um, my good friend.

01:19:20.022 --> 01:19:22.890
  Mel, this is Powers Andrews,
  my fiancé.

01:19:23.259 --> 01:19:27.261
And this is Leonard,
my assistant,
and Franklyn, my driver.

01:19:29.065 --> 01:19:32.233
     It's nice to meet you guys.
     I would shake hands, but...

01:19:32.869 --> 01:19:36.437
Oh, I wouldn't want to get
my hands all dirty anyway.
[laughs]

01:19:37.006 --> 01:19:40.407
Thank you so much
for protecting
my little sweet pea here.

01:19:42.845 --> 01:19:44.245
         She's worth protecting.

01:19:46.516 --> 01:19:47.848
             You're a lucky man.

01:19:47.850 --> 01:19:49.216
Well, I believe that real men

01:19:49.218 --> 01:19:50.918
create their own luck.

01:19:51.921 --> 01:19:58.058
The secret to success
is raw ambition,
a lot of planning...

01:19:59.195 --> 01:20:00.828
and the right amount
of financing.

01:20:03.966 --> 01:20:05.516
         Huh? [laughs]

01:20:05.517 --> 01:20:07.067
       That's funny,
    'cause I was referring to
       your upcoming wedding.

01:20:07.537 --> 01:20:09.503
       Oh! Oh.

01:20:09.505 --> 01:20:13.007
Oh, yeah, of course.
Yeah, same rules apply really.

01:20:13.242 --> 01:20:15.976
  [Haley] <i> I don't know</i>
  <i> what Jess sees in this guy.</i>

01:20:16.445 --> 01:20:19.280
    There you are. Come on,
    let's go register your stew.

01:20:22.151 --> 01:20:23.417
        I gotta go, Jess.

01:20:26.489 --> 01:20:27.588
              Bye.

01:20:29.826 --> 01:20:32.092
      -Bye.
      -[Leonard] Good luck
      with your stew!

01:20:33.095 --> 01:20:35.996
          Well, that's great
          because now we can
          catch the 2:15 flight.

01:20:35.998 --> 01:20:38.232
   Excellent!
   Let's get out of the 1800s

01:20:38.234 --> 01:20:40.034
   and back to modern America.
   Whoo!

01:20:42.004 --> 01:20:44.038
   -I can't wait to get home.
   -You know what?

01:20:44.907 --> 01:20:47.141
   I want to stay and see if Mel
   wins the stew competition.

01:20:47.610 --> 01:20:50.077
   But stew is so gross. Why?

01:20:50.079 --> 01:20:52.513
               Because it's--
               it's what I want.

01:20:52.515 --> 01:20:53.848
[Powers] Oh.

01:20:53.850 --> 01:20:57.384
   Look, coming back here
   has reminded me of who I was.

01:20:58.588 --> 01:21:00.221
                       Who I am.

01:21:00.223 --> 01:21:03.123
A nobody from a dinky town
in a pathetic state

01:21:03.125 --> 01:21:07.928
filled with people
whom to call them backwards
would be a compliment. [laughs]

01:21:10.967 --> 01:21:12.867
Did I say something wrong?

01:21:14.270 --> 01:21:16.203
Well, get after her!

01:21:16.205 --> 01:21:19.039
               Well, that wasn't
               in my original
               job description.

01:21:19.041 --> 01:21:22.476
Unless you want
your original job description
to read permanently unemployed,

01:21:22.478 --> 01:21:25.279
you will bring her
right back here to me.
Both of you. Go on, scoot!

01:21:27.183 --> 01:21:29.016
              What do we do now?

01:21:29.018 --> 01:21:32.052
Not sure, but we can't
leave her with him.
Follow me.

01:21:32.622 --> 01:21:34.054
             [sighs]

01:21:35.958 --> 01:21:38.292
    Phew. What's that smell?

01:21:38.294 --> 01:21:41.595
   -[Haley] <i> Coming through.</i>
   <i> Watch out.</i>
   -[Lindsay] <i> Coming through.</i>

01:21:41.597 --> 01:21:43.530
       -Hey, the dogs!
       -If we follow them,

01:21:43.532 --> 01:21:45.599
they'll lead us
to Ms. Reynolds.

01:21:45.601 --> 01:21:46.901
Let's go get them.

01:21:50.940 --> 01:21:52.506
   [Lindsay] <i> Watch your step.</i>

01:21:54.443 --> 01:21:56.443
       [Leonard grunting]

01:22:03.219 --> 01:22:04.652
           You think it's funny?

01:22:05.588 --> 01:22:08.255
[chuckles]
Misery loves company.

01:22:09.458 --> 01:22:10.958
                  [Leonard] Gah!

01:22:12.461 --> 01:22:14.061
                      Take that!

01:22:14.063 --> 01:22:16.697
             That went great.
             Come on. Follow me.

01:22:23.472 --> 01:22:24.571
                   Just in time.

01:22:25.341 --> 01:22:26.440
                     Yeah.

01:22:30.546 --> 01:22:32.112
                  Do you believe
                  in destiny?

01:22:35.217 --> 01:22:37.084
     You know what?
     Actually, I do.

01:22:37.086 --> 01:22:39.053
  'Cause I think we make
  a really good couple together.

01:22:39.055 --> 01:22:42.489
    -And I think we should--
    -Look, Sals,
    you're a great gal, okay?

01:22:42.491 --> 01:22:46.060
And you're gonna find
the right guy someday,
but I'm not him.

01:22:47.296 --> 01:22:50.564
My heart
belongs to someone else.
It always has and always will.

01:22:51.734 --> 01:22:53.500
And I can't
let her get away again.

01:22:55.504 --> 01:22:56.603
     I'm sorry.

01:23:03.346 --> 01:23:07.147
   Jessie! I refuse
   to let you leave this way.

01:23:07.149 --> 01:23:09.016
Why? Because I'm under contract?

01:23:09.685 --> 01:23:14.221
No. No, no, no, no.
This is not about business.
I love you.

01:23:14.757 --> 01:23:19.593
       Powers, everything you do
       is scheduled and planned
       and jotted down.

01:23:19.595 --> 01:23:21.695
          Look, I got caught up
          in that lifestyle too,

01:23:21.697 --> 01:23:23.364
            but that's not
            what I want anymore.

01:23:23.366 --> 01:23:25.332
                I'm free here,
                I'm spontaneous.

01:23:25.334 --> 01:23:28.502
Oh! Spontaneity!
That's what you want?

01:23:28.771 --> 01:23:31.438
If you want spontaneity,
I will give you spontaneity.

01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:34.308
We can get married right here,
right now today. Hmm?

01:23:34.643 --> 01:23:36.310
             -Today?
             -Yes.

01:23:36.312 --> 01:23:38.345
I'm sure that we can find
a justice of the peace

01:23:38.347 --> 01:23:41.415
somewhere in
this windswept wasteland
that can perform the ceremony.

01:23:41.650 --> 01:23:44.184
         [phone ringing]

01:23:44.186 --> 01:23:45.252
Hold that thought.

01:23:45.788 --> 01:23:49.423
Ooh! Hello. Yeah, hello.

01:23:50.226 --> 01:23:52.026
        -Hello?
          -Jess! Jess.

01:23:52.428 --> 01:23:57.631
Jess, I got to
tell you something.
I'm sorry. Okay, I was wrong.

01:23:58.634 --> 01:24:00.601
I was wrong
for not supporting you.

01:24:01.470 --> 01:24:03.737
Your career,
your dreams, your goals.

01:24:05.141 --> 01:24:09.209
I was selfish.
I was selfish
for trying to keep you here.

01:24:11.147 --> 01:24:14.314
They say if you love something,
you should set it free,

01:24:15.518 --> 01:24:16.717
not force it to stay.

01:24:18.287 --> 01:24:20.320
              What would you say
              if they came back?

01:24:24.727 --> 01:24:26.560
      -[Haley] <i> Yeah!</i>
      -[Lindsay] <i> We did it!</i>
      <i> We did it!</i>

01:24:26.762 --> 01:24:29.430
        [Haley] <i> Whoo-hoo!</i>
        <i> We're the best!</i>

01:24:32.201 --> 01:24:34.735
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

01:24:35.204 --> 01:24:37.504
That is my future wife
you're kissing!

01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:39.673
         Ex-future wife.

01:24:39.675 --> 01:24:42.543
Oh, no, no, no.
You're mistaken. He's the ex.

01:24:42.778 --> 01:24:44.078
     Not anymore.

01:24:46.515 --> 01:24:50.584
 Mr. Danberry! Congratulations!
 You're a winner.

01:24:51.387 --> 01:24:52.619
             I certainly am.

01:24:52.621 --> 01:24:57.224
No! I am the one
who always wins around here.
I am the winner.

01:24:57.460 --> 01:24:59.460
So, unless you want
to lose everything...

01:24:59.462 --> 01:25:04.331
     the car, the house,
     the jewelry,
     all of the clothes,

01:25:04.333 --> 01:25:07.634
     oh, and also
     your highly lucrative
     perfume contract,

01:25:07.636 --> 01:25:09.803
       all those dreams,
       poof, up in smoke!

01:25:10.306 --> 01:25:13.273
Powers. Look, you're confusing
your dreams with mine.

01:25:13.275 --> 01:25:15.109
Everything I want
is right here.

01:25:15.845 --> 01:25:19.213
I'm sorry, Powers.
I'm done.

01:25:19.582 --> 01:25:22.783
 Never say sorry
 unless you also say not sorry.

01:25:22.785 --> 01:25:24.718
        Sorry, not sorry.
        Sorry, not sorry.

01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:26.687
Ah, Leonard, please shut up.

01:25:26.689 --> 01:25:28.288
        No, you shut up.

01:25:28.290 --> 01:25:31.458
     Ms. Reynolds is right.
     You have never said
     one nice thing to me

01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:32.860
      in all the time
      I've worked for you.

01:25:33.395 --> 01:25:36.130
  I quit. I'm leaving you too.
  I do quit. I quit.

01:25:36.132 --> 01:25:38.165
           -I'm done.
           -Whatever!

      -Oh, no, no, no, no!

01:25:57.353 --> 01:26:00.854
   Do you know
   how much that ring cost me?
   Oh, you stupid mutt.

01:26:03.859 --> 01:26:05.225
           Oh, oh, oh.

01:26:05.661 --> 01:26:07.227

  to join Jessica and Melvin...

01:26:55.277 --> 01:26:57.344

01:26:57.746 --> 01:27:04.384
   Mel-- better--
   to join Jessica and Mel
   together in holy matrimony.

01:27:04.787 --> 01:27:06.720
        And the ring
        in this ceremony

01:27:06.722 --> 01:27:10.390
     symbolizes
     the never-ending circle
     of their love.

01:27:10.392 --> 01:27:11.658
           And it's...

01:27:13.462 --> 01:27:16.463
   No, it's... Hang on.
   It's right here. I got it.

01:27:27.776 --> 01:27:30.377
  Wait a minute. I had the ring,

01:27:30.579 --> 01:27:34.481

01:27:46.996 --> 01:27:48.662
        [Haley] <i> You know</i>
        <i> you're supposed</i>

01:27:48.664 --> 01:27:49.863
       <i> to wear diamonds,</i>
       <i> not eat them.</i>

01:27:49.865 --> 01:27:51.031
     [Lindsay] <i> It was tasty.</i>

01:27:51.433 --> 01:27:54.501
     Well, we'll get it back
     very fast.

01:27:56.805 --> 01:28:00.574
     You can't kiss yet.
     Got to retrieve the...

01:28:01.577 --> 01:28:02.676
              ring.

01:28:03.679 --> 01:28:05.612
   [Lindsay] <i> Here we go again.</i>

01:28:05.614 --> 01:28:07.748
   -[Mel] I love you.
   -[Jessica] I love you too.

01:28:30.739 --> 01:28:32.773
         [gags, groans]

01:28:34.343 --> 01:28:36.443
       Oh, God. [panting]

01:28:37.746 --> 01:28:39.880
     I'm probably gonna get
     eaten alive
     by some redneck.

01:28:40.582 --> 01:28:41.782
            Oh, God.

01:28:43.552 --> 01:28:44.685
    Ow.

01:28:49.858 --> 01:28:51.425
Oh, oh, oh.

01:28:51.727 --> 01:28:52.826
     Okay.

01:28:59.968 --> 01:29:01.968
        [sighs] Oh. Phew.

01:29:02.971 --> 01:29:04.638
         Whoo! [laughs]

01:29:06.342 --> 01:29:08.742
            Hi! Yeah.

01:29:10.012 --> 01:29:14.014
Well, well, well.
   You going my way, sweetheart?

01:29:14.016 --> 01:29:16.450
    [scoffs]
    I can do so much better.

01:29:17.519 --> 01:29:18.752
No, you can't!

01:29:20.356 --> 01:29:23.490
  No one can do better than me!
  I'm the best!
