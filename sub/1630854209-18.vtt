00:02.536 --> 00:04.138
Previously on East New York...

00:04.238 --> 00:05.873
Now, you might be able to get
away with killing Yolo Linden,

00:05.973 --> 00:07.875
but your partner's death
is gonna be a little tougher.

00:07.975 --> 00:09.643
If it was me that went
off of my nut,

00:09.743 --> 00:12.480
Remy would've clipped me
without hesitation!

00:12.580 --> 00:13.981
Instead, you did it to him!

00:14.082 --> 00:15.683
We're from a different
generation, Marvin.

00:15.783 --> 00:17.851
We like to screw up our
relationships in person.

00:17.951 --> 00:20.088
Is that what I did?
Not just you.

00:20.188 --> 00:22.656
But that's not a reason
not to give it a try.

00:22.756 --> 00:24.625
FAITH: What's going on
with your friend Sean?

00:24.725 --> 00:26.194
Do you worry
that you'll be hurt?

00:26.294 --> 00:27.595
I don't hurt all that easily.

00:27.695 --> 00:28.729
Your father managed

00:28.829 --> 00:30.131
to do a pretty good job of it.

00:30.231 --> 00:31.632
You collared Kurt Walsh.

00:31.732 --> 00:34.602
He's no doubt talking to
the D.A., trying to cut a deal.

00:34.702 --> 00:36.437
I have friends who are...

00:36.537 --> 00:38.106
concerned about
what he's saying.

00:38.206 --> 00:40.608
Apparently they're getting close
to coming out with indictments

00:40.708 --> 00:42.243
around the death of Yolo Linden.

00:42.343 --> 00:43.511
Well, you said yourself,

00:43.611 --> 00:44.978
somebody has to answer
for his killing.

00:45.079 --> 00:46.247
I just never figured

00:46.347 --> 00:49.417
that one of them
would be your father.

00:52.653 --> 00:54.355
RITA (echoing):
You won't find anything.

00:56.290 --> 00:58.859
Hey, you can't go
through my stuff.

00:58.959 --> 01:01.262
That's mine!

01:01.362 --> 01:03.030
No, let go.

01:03.131 --> 01:04.732
(grunting)

01:08.869 --> 01:09.837
(door closes)

01:09.937 --> 01:12.473
("No More" by Steve Mason
playing)

01:12.573 --> 01:17.044
* All aboard, I see Australia *

01:17.145 --> 01:22.216
* All aboard,
I don't see right *

01:23.015 --> 01:27.621
* All aboard, I see Australia *

01:27.721 --> 01:31.125
* Heaven knows
I can't see right... *

01:31.225 --> 01:33.127
(indistinct radio transmission)

01:33.227 --> 01:34.428
Good morning, Inspector.

01:34.527 --> 01:35.963
A.D.A. Diskant.

01:36.063 --> 01:37.997
I don't expect to see you in
the prisoner loading dock.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.168
I don't expect to see
you here either.

01:40.268 --> 01:42.536
We're both here to see
the same individual.

01:42.636 --> 01:44.372
The difference is,
I'm allowed to talk to him

01:44.472 --> 01:45.739
and you're not.

01:45.839 --> 01:47.508
We have a number
of old investigations open,

01:47.608 --> 01:48.509
and I'm led to believe

01:48.609 --> 01:50.211
that Kurt Walsh might have

01:50.311 --> 01:51.745
information relevant to them.

01:51.845 --> 01:53.714
Are you a detective now,
Inspector?

01:53.814 --> 01:55.916
Well, no, my range
of responsibility extends

01:56.015 --> 01:57.351
over whatever happens
at the 7-4,

01:57.451 --> 01:59.620
past or present.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.955
I admire a lot of what
you've instituted

02:02.055 --> 02:03.857
at the 7-4
since you took over,

02:03.957 --> 02:05.759
but you're here
because of your father.

02:05.859 --> 02:07.828
You're here because
you're open to believing

02:07.928 --> 02:09.896
that what Kurt Walsh
tells you is true.

02:09.997 --> 02:12.466
And that he's going
to deliver one or more cops,

02:12.566 --> 02:13.834
as dirty as he is,

02:13.934 --> 02:16.804
and that one of those cops
is Mo Haywood.

02:17.905 --> 02:20.574
Why don't you put him in the
fourth floor conference room?

02:20.674 --> 02:21.609
OFFICER:
Yes, ma'am.

02:21.709 --> 02:23.677
* No more... *

02:23.777 --> 02:25.478
Top of the morning to you,
Inspector.

02:25.579 --> 02:27.215
OFFICER 2:
Let's go.

02:27.315 --> 02:29.250
* No more... *

02:29.350 --> 02:33.853
So he wants to do his time in
a prison closer to New York City

02:33.954 --> 02:35.223
than the Canadian border,
and you're going

02:35.323 --> 02:36.624
to consider giving that to him?

02:36.724 --> 02:39.126
I am not at liberty to say.

02:39.227 --> 02:40.127
Right.

02:40.228 --> 02:42.463
* No more *

02:43.331 --> 02:45.065
* No more *

02:46.033 --> 02:47.935
* No more. *

02:48.869 --> 02:50.504
I'll try not to be boring.

02:50.603 --> 02:52.506
I won't say anything
that embarrasses you.

02:52.606 --> 02:53.774
You won't embarrass me.

02:53.874 --> 02:55.075
Mm-hmm.
I'm sure there are parents

02:55.175 --> 02:56.977
that do way cooler
things than I do.

02:57.077 --> 03:01.382
Don't you have some big movie
director's kid in your class?

03:01.482 --> 03:03.183
Yeah, but he's not coming.

03:03.284 --> 03:04.718
Anyway, you're a detective.

03:04.818 --> 03:06.654
That's way cooler
than anything else.

03:06.754 --> 03:08.222
Ms. Morales, can I talk
to you a second?

03:08.322 --> 03:10.023
Yeah.

03:13.994 --> 03:16.063
I am so sorry to do
this at the last minute.

03:16.163 --> 03:17.498
We've had some feedback

03:17.598 --> 03:19.767
from parents regarding
your talking to the class.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.702
What kind of feedback?
I haven't done it yet.

03:21.802 --> 03:24.405
I think the feeling is that...

03:24.505 --> 03:26.039
policing is a polarizing subject

03:26.139 --> 03:27.475
and that...

03:27.575 --> 03:28.776
as important as it is

03:28.876 --> 03:30.444
and as much as there
are good cops

03:30.544 --> 03:32.480
who are doing all kinds
of good work,

03:32.579 --> 03:33.881
it brings up a lot of issues.

03:33.981 --> 03:36.049
They feel that
your presence itself

03:36.149 --> 03:38.218
and, God, I'm...

03:38.319 --> 03:39.653
I hate to say this,
but that...

03:39.753 --> 03:41.922
it could be triggering
for some of our students.

03:42.022 --> 03:43.123
My presence?

03:43.223 --> 03:45.259
Career Day should
speak to inclusion.

03:45.359 --> 03:46.860
One child's parent
is a janitor,

03:46.960 --> 03:48.195
one child's parent is a banker.

03:48.296 --> 03:49.963
Both, all, are members
of our society,

03:50.063 --> 03:51.732
are members of our community.

03:51.832 --> 03:54.001
How many children that go here
have janitors as parents?

03:54.101 --> 03:56.370
That's not really
the point, Ms. Morales.

03:56.470 --> 03:58.805
No, the point is, you don't
want me participating.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.708
Not at this particular
moment, no.

04:01.509 --> 04:02.410
I would hope,

04:02.510 --> 04:03.811
for many reasons,

04:03.911 --> 04:06.414
that the polarization
around policing lessens,

04:06.514 --> 04:08.215
that the police officer

04:08.316 --> 04:10.451
can take his or her place
alongside the butcher,

04:10.551 --> 04:12.420
the baker
and the candlestick maker.

04:12.520 --> 04:15.289
That is the kind of society that
I hope we're working toward.

04:15.389 --> 04:16.923
Great, Ms. Greer.

04:17.024 --> 04:19.660
Tell my son that I got bumped
for the candlestick maker.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.228
And when he gets home,

04:21.329 --> 04:22.663
I'll tell him the truth.

04:26.867 --> 04:29.202
(helicopter blades whirring)

04:29.303 --> 04:31.138
(siren chirps)

04:31.238 --> 04:32.373
So, who called it in?

04:32.473 --> 04:33.907
Neighbor. Said he
heard loud noises,

04:34.007 --> 04:35.376
then he heard somebody fall.

04:35.476 --> 04:37.210
Went in to check it out,
the lady was unconscious.

04:37.311 --> 04:38.379
Name is Rita Albert.

04:38.479 --> 04:40.047
She live alone?

04:40.147 --> 04:41.682
Apparently she has a grown
son, lives with her.

04:41.782 --> 04:42.883
What's this one?

04:42.983 --> 04:44.618
Looks like a home invasion.

04:44.718 --> 04:45.619
Oh...

04:45.719 --> 04:47.220
You look good in uniform.

04:47.321 --> 04:48.221
You should wear this more often.

04:48.322 --> 04:49.390
Not now.
MAN: Detective.

04:50.457 --> 04:52.960
Interest of maintaining
crime scene integrity,

04:53.060 --> 04:55.062
maybe we should extend the
perimeters a little bit further.

04:56.229 --> 04:59.032
Yeah. Thanks, chief.
Appreciate the help.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.968
No problem.

05:02.403 --> 05:03.737
Security cameras?
Nada.

05:03.837 --> 05:05.506
And no sign of forced entry.

05:05.606 --> 05:08.008
Our victim's name
is Rita Albert.

05:08.108 --> 05:09.643
Back door is locked
and barred...
How's it going?

05:09.743 --> 05:11.345
Good.

05:11.445 --> 05:12.946
You know, between sector
cars and Crime Scene,

05:13.046 --> 05:14.982
sometimes they can't get
an ambulance through.

05:15.082 --> 05:16.617
Whose head's on
the chopping block then?

05:16.717 --> 05:17.951
You a cop?

05:18.051 --> 05:19.620
Let's just say I know
what I'm talking about.

05:19.720 --> 05:20.621
SANDEFORD:
Andre.

05:20.721 --> 05:22.990
Check this guy out.

05:24.725 --> 05:26.627
What's up, man?

05:28.295 --> 05:29.196
Excuse me, sir?

05:29.296 --> 05:31.098
Sir...

05:32.400 --> 05:34.835
Hey! Stop running!

05:36.770 --> 05:39.373
Got nowhere else to go.
Put your hands in the air.

05:39.473 --> 05:41.375
Put your hands in the air.

05:41.475 --> 05:42.543
Against the shed.

05:42.643 --> 05:44.378
Why'd you run, my man?

05:44.478 --> 05:46.814
Ah, no reason.

05:51.084 --> 05:53.587
Justin Albert.
You Rita Albert's son?

05:53.687 --> 05:55.255
How you know that?

05:55.355 --> 05:56.724
Come on.

05:56.824 --> 05:57.957
Got some friends who want
to have a chat with you.

05:58.058 --> 05:59.226
Okay.

06:09.236 --> 06:10.838
* All this ice on me,
flashing lights on me *

06:10.938 --> 06:12.606
* Spotlight on me *

06:12.706 --> 06:15.943
* But can't stay low-key. *

06:18.679 --> 06:19.780
Chief.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.416
Collar brass is
upside-down, Officer.

06:22.516 --> 06:24.051
Sorry, Chief.
Hey, hey.

06:24.151 --> 06:26.053
I'm kidding.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.288
¿Qué te pasa?

06:31.825 --> 06:34.227
It hit me this morning.

06:34.327 --> 06:37.097
That having a cop for a mother
can be tough on a kid.

06:38.999 --> 06:40.901
All kinds of things
can be tough on a kid.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.337
Some things they turn out
to be grateful for.

06:47.441 --> 06:48.742
Chief?

06:48.842 --> 06:50.110
Thank you.

06:51.512 --> 06:53.280
(sniffles)

06:54.247 --> 06:56.249
* *

07:04.858 --> 07:06.727
You got one of those, right?
I don't.

07:06.827 --> 07:08.395
I remember when
you got that one.

07:08.496 --> 07:11.832
Over the years, you get all
these certificates and plaques

07:11.932 --> 07:13.100
and trophies.

07:13.200 --> 07:14.835
Most of them I keep
down in the basement.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.303
For some reason...

07:16.403 --> 07:18.739
I keep this one up here.
I am worried, Dad.

07:18.839 --> 07:20.707
What are you worried about?

07:20.808 --> 07:21.875
I'm worried what Kurt Walsh

07:21.975 --> 07:23.744
is telling the D.A.

07:23.844 --> 07:27.347
Honey, Kurt Walsh
has zero credibility.

07:27.447 --> 07:28.849
They run this up the chain

07:28.949 --> 07:31.652
at the D.A.'s office,
they're gonna recognize that.

07:31.752 --> 07:33.587
And this whole
thing is gonna go away.

07:33.687 --> 07:35.523
Unless it doesn't.

07:35.623 --> 07:36.890
Unless somebody looking to make

07:36.990 --> 07:39.058
a name for herself,
like Vonny Diskant,

07:39.159 --> 07:40.728
decides to go after

07:40.828 --> 07:43.531
whatever cops she can--
decorated cops, all the better.

07:43.631 --> 07:46.534
Well, you'll be happy
to know I got a lawyer.

07:47.668 --> 07:49.703
In case things get to the point
where I need one.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.739
Who'd you hire?

07:51.839 --> 07:52.740
Sy Somers.

07:52.840 --> 07:55.643
Sy is a hundred years old,

07:55.743 --> 07:56.810
and most of his clients

07:56.909 --> 07:58.311
come to him

07:58.411 --> 08:00.681
to get rental applications
notarized.

08:00.781 --> 08:01.682
Please.

08:01.782 --> 08:03.083
Don't kid yourself.

08:03.183 --> 08:04.484
Sy knows his way
around the courthouse.

08:04.585 --> 08:07.220
He doesn't inspire
a lot of confidence.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.256
Forget all that.

08:12.159 --> 08:14.161
Do you think I had
anything to do with

08:14.261 --> 08:16.096
the killing of that
confidential informant?

08:16.196 --> 08:18.231
It doesn't matter what I think.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.500
It does matter what you think.

08:20.601 --> 08:22.135
It matters to me.

08:26.674 --> 08:30.310
I don't think you had anything
to do with it.

08:30.410 --> 08:31.679
Then, for now...

08:31.779 --> 08:33.914
I can put that in my hip pocket

08:34.014 --> 08:35.549
and take on the world.

08:50.598 --> 08:52.465
You just got out of
the joint in January.

08:52.566 --> 08:54.868
When I saw all them
cop cars, I ran.

08:54.968 --> 08:56.336
PTSD, you know?

08:56.436 --> 09:00.173
Yeah, well, whoever it was
that got into the house,

09:00.273 --> 09:02.009
your mother put up
quite a fight.

09:02.109 --> 09:04.111
She sustained a concussion

09:04.211 --> 09:05.412
and a hairline skull fracture.

09:05.512 --> 09:07.147
Why didn't you tell
me this before?

09:07.247 --> 09:09.016
She's still unconscious,
but her vital signs look good.

09:09.116 --> 09:10.450
Well, can I see her?

09:10.550 --> 09:11.985
Let's get done what we
got to do first, huh?

09:12.085 --> 09:13.386
Are you still dealing
bootleg pharmaceuticals?

09:13.486 --> 09:14.354
Definitely not.

09:14.454 --> 09:16.289
Hmm. We searched the house.

09:16.389 --> 09:19.226
I keep a few around
for my anxiety.

09:22.696 --> 09:24.497
Must be some
big-time anxiety.

09:24.598 --> 09:25.633
Yeah.

09:25.733 --> 09:27.300
Okay, that's a 90-day supply.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.869
They cracked down on
writing prescriptions.

09:28.969 --> 09:30.137
That's number one.

09:30.237 --> 09:31.772
Then, even if you
have a prescription,

09:31.872 --> 09:33.707
in order to get it filled,
you got to walk down the aisle

09:33.807 --> 09:35.042
with the adult diapers,

09:35.142 --> 09:37.611
which, since my stepfather
was incontinent,

09:37.711 --> 09:38.712
acts as a trigger for me.

09:38.812 --> 09:40.113
You got a trigger, too, huh?

09:40.213 --> 09:41.514
KILLIAN:
All right, so, tell me,

09:41.615 --> 09:42.783
what does your mother
think of you having

09:42.883 --> 09:44.051
this size stash in the house?

09:44.151 --> 09:45.152
Very understanding.

09:45.252 --> 09:46.153
Oh, is she a pill junkie, too?

09:46.253 --> 09:47.487
Strictly homeopathic.

09:47.587 --> 09:48.822
She don't take no pills.

09:48.922 --> 09:49.990
So she couldn't be
too understanding

09:50.090 --> 09:51.558
of you dealing out of the house.

09:51.659 --> 09:52.559
I wasn't dealing.

09:52.660 --> 09:54.795
Hmm. Well...

09:54.895 --> 09:57.130
That kind of quantity?

09:57.230 --> 10:00.067
The law considers possession
with intent to sell.

10:00.167 --> 10:01.635
Your mother found them,

10:01.735 --> 10:03.436
you got into a fight with her,
one thing led to another,

10:03.536 --> 10:04.772
and you hit her.

10:04.872 --> 10:05.906
I'd never hit my mother.

10:06.006 --> 10:06.907
Yeah, well, who did, Justin?

10:07.007 --> 10:08.441
MORALES:
Who?

10:08.541 --> 10:10.410
Who that she would know
and open the door for?
Hold on.

10:10.510 --> 10:11.979
No, and don't just pick
a name out of a hat either.

10:12.079 --> 10:13.046
Then I don't know, man.

10:13.146 --> 10:14.748
I don't have no names,

10:14.848 --> 10:16.717
I don't have no hat.

10:16.817 --> 10:18.652
So, what y'all want from me?

10:20.754 --> 10:22.255
Where were you this morning?

10:22.355 --> 10:23.691
Same as every morning:

10:23.791 --> 10:25.558
driving a 24-foot box truck

10:25.659 --> 10:27.494
from Hunts Point to
my drop-offs in Brooklyn.

10:27.594 --> 10:29.529
You could call my boss.
I'll give you his number.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.265
In the meanwhile,
can I go see my mother?

10:32.365 --> 10:34.001
Please.

10:35.836 --> 10:38.706
* *

10:41.975 --> 10:43.376
Come on in.

10:43.476 --> 10:44.444
May I?

10:44.544 --> 10:46.513
Sure.

10:49.783 --> 10:52.552
I appreciate you taking
the time to see me, Chief.

10:52.652 --> 10:53.854
How can I help you?

10:54.822 --> 10:57.157
One of your precinct commanders
came to see me today.

10:57.257 --> 10:58.792
Regina Haywood
is concerned

10:58.892 --> 11:01.995
that Maurice Haywood is the
target of an investigation.

11:02.095 --> 11:03.263
I'm not surprised
she's concerned.

11:03.363 --> 11:04.564
He is her father, after all.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.466
It comes to a homicide
investigation

11:06.566 --> 11:08.969
involving retired cops
from the 7-4,

11:09.069 --> 11:10.137
a lot of people are concerned.

11:10.237 --> 11:11.872
But she has to know

11:11.972 --> 11:14.775
involving herself
is beyond inappropriate.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.409
And if I detect any sign

11:16.509 --> 11:18.278
that she continues
to be involved,

11:18.378 --> 11:20.413
I will have no choice but
to order an official inquiry.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.415
I'm sure that
won't be necessary.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.718
I'll speak with
Inspector Haywood...

11:24.818 --> 11:25.819
first chance I get.

11:25.919 --> 11:28.088
Very good.

11:28.889 --> 11:30.457
Thank you.

11:34.795 --> 11:38.031
SY:
When's the last
time I saw you?

11:38.131 --> 11:39.399
I don't know, Sy.
It's been a while.

11:39.499 --> 11:41.769
Abe Reznikoff's
memorial maybe?

11:41.869 --> 11:44.437
Really? Wow.
(laughs): Yeah.
I think so.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.974
Here, come in.
Thank you.

11:47.074 --> 11:50.577
My father tells me
you're representing him.

11:50.677 --> 11:53.146
Yeah, he likes that I don't
charge for phone calls.
Get out of here.

11:56.716 --> 11:59.419
Please don't take
this the wrong way.

11:59.519 --> 12:01.021
Do you feel like
you're up to it?

12:01.121 --> 12:03.356
I know your father a long time.

12:03.456 --> 12:04.825
I count him as my friend.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.827
If I need help,

12:06.927 --> 12:09.296
I will get help. Okay?

12:10.831 --> 12:12.165
Okay.

12:13.633 --> 12:16.669
I know that the D.A.'s talking
to Kurt Walsh.

12:16.770 --> 12:18.305
Do we know what
Walsh is telling them?

12:18.405 --> 12:20.007
Yeah, the D.A.'s office
provided us

12:20.107 --> 12:21.975
with Walsh's affidavit

12:22.075 --> 12:24.845
as part of mandatory discovery.

12:24.945 --> 12:26.646
And he states
that he was present

12:26.746 --> 12:28.115
in the motel room

12:28.215 --> 12:30.683
the night Mr. Linden
was shot and fatally wounded.

12:30.784 --> 12:33.353
Also present were an
undercover police officer

12:33.453 --> 12:35.622
from Internal Affairs
and a prostitute

12:35.722 --> 12:38.491
designated Jane Doe,
names redacted.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.293
Do we know who either
of them are?

12:40.393 --> 12:42.195
Since your father provided me

12:42.295 --> 12:43.463
with all of his records,

12:43.563 --> 12:44.932
we know that the undercover...

12:45.032 --> 12:46.299
was him.

12:47.134 --> 12:48.235
You're kidding.

12:48.335 --> 12:50.470
Corroborated by
Internal Affairs.

12:53.540 --> 12:56.810
Well, uh,
what about the prostitute

12:56.910 --> 12:58.211
designated Jane Doe?

12:58.311 --> 12:59.679
Has not been identified.

13:01.614 --> 13:04.184
I imagined my father
doing a lot of things,

13:04.284 --> 13:05.618
I never would have imagined

13:05.718 --> 13:07.087
him working undercover
for Internal Affairs.

13:07.187 --> 13:09.522
Some things you take
to the grave.

13:13.861 --> 13:16.830
(sighs)
What does Walsh's
affidavit allege

13:16.930 --> 13:18.798
my father did in the motel room?

13:18.899 --> 13:21.034
Does it... even say?

13:21.134 --> 13:22.569
According to Walsh,

13:22.669 --> 13:24.671
it was your father
who pulled the trigger.

13:34.882 --> 13:38.285
* *

13:40.487 --> 13:42.822
Oh, hey, I forgot to ask:
How'd Career Day go?

13:42.923 --> 13:44.757
Where are we on the robbery?

13:45.825 --> 13:46.994
Uh, guy next door

13:47.094 --> 13:48.795
had a security camera rigged up

13:48.896 --> 13:51.564
on account of people
going through his garbage.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.000
I'm just trying
to get it to play.

13:53.733 --> 13:55.702
Shouldn't be
that tough, Tommy.

13:55.802 --> 13:57.070
Get up.

13:57.938 --> 13:59.272
What's wrong with you?

13:59.372 --> 14:00.707
Nothing.

14:00.807 --> 14:03.643
Something happened
at the school.

14:03.743 --> 14:05.545
Yeah, something
happened at the school.

14:06.313 --> 14:09.216
They don't want me to talk
to Sebastian's class.

14:10.217 --> 14:10.951
Why not?

14:11.051 --> 14:13.620
Danger of triggering.

14:13.720 --> 14:15.355
I carry a gun
and a set of cuffs,

14:15.455 --> 14:17.657
and those Upper East Side
parents that send

14:17.757 --> 14:18.791
their kids to that school

14:18.892 --> 14:20.060
would rather not
think about that.

14:20.160 --> 14:20.894
Makes you think
he'd be better off

14:20.994 --> 14:21.895
someplace else.

14:21.995 --> 14:23.430
Someplace else where?

14:23.530 --> 14:25.432
Where you don't find that
kind of anti-cop sentiment.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.000
So take him away
from his friends

14:27.100 --> 14:29.036
in the middle of a school year,
blow off the scholarship

14:29.136 --> 14:32.072
that lets him have
the advantages of that school?

14:35.175 --> 14:37.844
He was so excited to have me
stand up in his class, too.

14:37.945 --> 14:39.479
You'd think that would matter.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.382
(sighs)

14:42.482 --> 14:44.417
What's the timestamp
we're looking for?

14:44.517 --> 14:47.087
Well, we put it around 06:30.

14:51.290 --> 14:52.960
Wait a minute.

14:57.897 --> 15:00.133
The perp's a cop.

15:02.535 --> 15:04.004
(sighs)

15:07.107 --> 15:08.908
Chief, you wanted
to see me?
Yeah, come on in.

15:09.009 --> 15:10.777
Thanks for coming over.

15:12.779 --> 15:15.215
You've been asking questions
about the Yolo Linden case?

15:16.849 --> 15:19.619
Vonny Diskant is looking to
put another notch on her belt,

15:19.719 --> 15:22.689
which is fine, but if she's
cutting deals with Kurt Walsh,

15:22.789 --> 15:23.991
I want to know about it.

15:24.091 --> 15:25.258
At this stage
of the investigation,

15:25.358 --> 15:27.094
you're not supposed
to know about it.

15:27.194 --> 15:29.396
So I find out my father's been
lied about after the fact.

15:29.496 --> 15:31.598
How sure are you
that it would be a lie?

15:31.698 --> 15:32.599
Look at the source.

15:32.699 --> 15:34.968
No. I know.

15:37.804 --> 15:40.073
Between Kurt Walsh
and Mo Haywood,

15:40.173 --> 15:41.408
who are you going to believe?

15:41.508 --> 15:42.642
Yolo was my guy, Regina.

15:42.742 --> 15:44.177
I must've cleared

15:44.277 --> 15:46.913
a dozen major cases using
information he provided me.

15:47.014 --> 15:48.348
The fact that his murder

15:48.448 --> 15:52.219
has gone unsolved
all these years weighs on me.

15:53.353 --> 15:56.323
So you're not willing
to rule out the possibility

15:56.423 --> 15:58.758
that it was my father
who killed him.

15:58.858 --> 16:00.493
No. I'm not willing
to rule it out.

16:00.593 --> 16:03.330
I want the truth to come out
as much as you do, Chief.

16:03.430 --> 16:05.165
The truth has a way
of coming out.

16:05.265 --> 16:07.534
And if it means your father
gets indicted

16:07.634 --> 16:09.902
and has to stand trial,
that's what it means.

16:10.003 --> 16:11.438
But you can't interfere.

16:13.173 --> 16:14.441
Are we straight on that?

16:19.779 --> 16:22.115
Yes, sir.

16:31.524 --> 16:34.327
* *

16:35.628 --> 16:38.431
MAURICE: That-that address is
right off Avenue C, right?

16:38.531 --> 16:40.133
KEE: Avenue C, yeah.
MAURICE: That's where
he grew up?

16:40.233 --> 16:41.468
Dad?
KEE:
Lower East Side.

16:41.568 --> 16:42.769
No kidding?
Dad.

16:43.770 --> 16:46.539
His dad grew up on
the Lower East Side.
One second.

16:46.639 --> 16:48.808
We send out the picture
of this suspected cop-burglar?

16:48.908 --> 16:50.743
Uh, it went out to
the chief of D's office.

16:50.843 --> 16:53.346
They should be sending it out,
uh, citywide any time now.

16:53.446 --> 16:54.947
What's this?

16:55.048 --> 16:57.284
You wanted to look at
my notes from back then.

16:57.384 --> 16:58.785
I brought 'em over.
Great.

16:58.885 --> 17:00.353
Let's go to my office.

17:00.453 --> 17:01.921
(grunts)

17:02.021 --> 17:04.424
I'll see you, Kee.
Lieutenant.

17:05.192 --> 17:07.194
MAURICE: Sy told me
you stopped by today.

17:07.294 --> 17:10.630
I wanted to satisfy myself
that he was up to the task.

17:10.730 --> 17:11.631
Did you?

17:11.731 --> 17:13.599
Not particularly.

17:13.700 --> 17:16.703
But he managed to unearth
some interesting things.

17:16.803 --> 17:18.003
Like what?

17:18.105 --> 17:20.406
For starters, I wasn't
expecting to hear

17:20.507 --> 17:24.144
you were a field associate
for Internal Affairs.

17:25.545 --> 17:29.616
You really got to put that
in context, Regina.

17:29.716 --> 17:32.285
Back then, the 7-4

17:32.385 --> 17:34.821
had cops who were
like gangsters.

17:34.921 --> 17:36.289
They were shaking
drug dealers down,

17:36.389 --> 17:38.125
they were terrorizing people.

17:38.225 --> 17:41.261
When IAD approached me
to help put a stop to it,

17:41.361 --> 17:43.396
it seemed like
a good thing to do.

17:46.366 --> 17:49.336
I imagine that must have
been hard for you.

17:53.005 --> 17:57.310
Most of the cops that I gave up,
I didn't lose any sleep over.

17:57.410 --> 17:59.346
But then some of them you did.

18:01.047 --> 18:04.617
There was a guy I gave up
for frequenting social clubs,

18:04.717 --> 18:06.386
then for taking money.

18:06.486 --> 18:10.223
He got suspended,
then fired, then divorced.

18:10.323 --> 18:13.493
Last I heard, he was
driving a tow truck.

18:13.593 --> 18:16.129
What about Kurt Walsh?

18:16.963 --> 18:18.231
What about him?

18:18.331 --> 18:21.000
Ever pass along anything
incriminating about him?

18:21.100 --> 18:23.536
Numerous times.

18:23.636 --> 18:25.205
That man is an animal.

18:25.305 --> 18:28.141
I watched Kurt Walsh
tune up a runner

18:28.241 --> 18:31.411
for one of the heroin dealers
over on Pitkin Avenue.

18:31.511 --> 18:34.981
Kid couldn't have weighed
more than a hundred pounds.

18:35.081 --> 18:36.849
Walsh took his stash

18:36.949 --> 18:40.187
and took his money, then threw
him down a flight of stairs.

18:40.287 --> 18:42.088
Walsh ever get busted for that?

18:42.189 --> 18:44.591
Until he murdered his ex-partner

18:44.691 --> 18:46.058
a few months ago,

18:46.159 --> 18:49.362
Walsh never got
busted for anything.

18:52.699 --> 18:54.133
BENTLEY:
Yeah, we'll talk about it
some more.

18:54.234 --> 18:55.968
OFFICER: All right.
See you later.

18:57.003 --> 18:59.071
Hey.
Hey.

18:59.172 --> 19:01.073
Let me show you something.

19:01.174 --> 19:02.509
What's up?

19:02.609 --> 19:05.312
It's my shield.

19:06.379 --> 19:07.414
You gonna wear that?

19:07.514 --> 19:09.649
No, I'm not gonna
wear it, stupid.

19:09.749 --> 19:10.683
Oh.

19:10.783 --> 19:11.984
I'm gonna gave it to Tamika.

19:14.521 --> 19:16.155
That's like a thing, right?

19:16.256 --> 19:18.658
Wearing a miniature
of somebody's shield?

19:18.758 --> 19:20.527
Yes, Andre, it's a thing.

19:20.627 --> 19:22.061
Nah, I mean...

19:22.161 --> 19:23.830
must mean things are going
pretty good between you and her.

19:23.930 --> 19:27.200
We wake up next to each other
in the morning,

19:27.300 --> 19:30.002
go to sleep next
to each other at night.

19:31.371 --> 19:33.139
There ain't nothing I want
that I don't have.

19:33.240 --> 19:35.642
(phones chiming)

19:40.680 --> 19:42.882
Whoa, it was a cop behind
that assault this morning?

19:42.982 --> 19:44.317
He looks familiar.

19:46.619 --> 19:48.655
Yeah.

19:48.755 --> 19:51.190
He does look familiar.

19:51.958 --> 19:53.460
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

19:54.961 --> 19:56.629
One thing this guy had going
for him: a cop shows up

19:56.729 --> 19:58.365
in uniform, most people
are gonna let him in,

19:58.465 --> 20:00.300
which explains
the no forced entry.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.502
Something about
this guy's wrong.

20:02.602 --> 20:04.237
Excuse me, Detectives.
We just got an alert.

20:04.337 --> 20:05.905
We think that-- Yo.

20:06.005 --> 20:08.941
That's the guy we all saw at
the crime scene this morning.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.109
He's definitely not a cop.

20:10.209 --> 20:11.278
He kind of talked
like one, though.

20:12.245 --> 20:13.346
That's the know-it-all guy.

20:13.446 --> 20:14.781
Those medals are
military medals.

20:14.881 --> 20:16.583
And the collar brass
are flowers.

20:16.683 --> 20:17.617
I'm glad he's not a cop,

20:17.717 --> 20:19.085
he's a damn police buff.

20:19.185 --> 20:21.354
MORALES:
A police buff assaulting
women in their homes.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.462
Oh, excuse me, Officer.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.030
Yes, ma'am, how can I help you?

20:31.130 --> 20:34.734
I-I've managed to get
separated from my tour group.

20:34.834 --> 20:37.270
I know the bus is
leaving from the corner

20:37.370 --> 20:39.439
of Liberty and Sheffield.

20:39.539 --> 20:41.708
I hope I'm pronouncing
that correctly.

20:41.808 --> 20:42.909
Yeah, you're fine.

20:43.009 --> 20:44.344
So, this is Liberty here.
Uh-huh.

20:44.444 --> 20:46.346
And Sheffield is just two
blocks in that direction.

20:46.446 --> 20:48.147
Oh, thank you.
And if you'd like...

20:48.247 --> 20:49.982
I can walk you there.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.951
Oh, would you?

20:52.051 --> 20:54.487
It would be my pleasure.
Come on.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.789
Thank you.

20:56.889 --> 20:59.526
* *

21:08.401 --> 21:10.102
SEAN:
Hey.

21:10.202 --> 21:12.004
You coming to bed anytime soon?
No.

21:12.104 --> 21:14.307
Ticket stubs from Yankees games,

21:14.407 --> 21:17.977
copies of 61s
he wrote as a patrolman,

21:18.077 --> 21:20.079
and matchbooks
from restaurants.

21:20.179 --> 21:21.548
Wow.

21:21.648 --> 21:23.282
Well, if you know
what you're looking for,

21:23.383 --> 21:24.817
I could try and help you.

21:24.917 --> 21:27.520
I don't know what I'm looking
for. That's the problem.

21:27.620 --> 21:30.323
I also don't know why he would
hold onto all this stuff.

21:30.423 --> 21:31.958
Well, he was living two lives.

21:32.058 --> 21:33.326
Might have been a matter
of trying to keep straight

21:33.426 --> 21:34.694
what was in each of them.

21:34.794 --> 21:35.928
Is that what you did?

21:36.028 --> 21:37.330
When you lie
for a living,

21:37.430 --> 21:39.366
you got to remember
who you told what to.

21:40.767 --> 21:43.202
Are you lying
to anyone now, Sean?

21:44.404 --> 21:49.609
Well, my name's not Sean Dryden.

21:51.978 --> 21:53.045
(laughs sarcastically)

21:53.145 --> 21:54.614
(laughs)

22:10.863 --> 22:12.432
What's going on?

22:14.266 --> 22:15.668
Nothing.

22:16.836 --> 22:17.904
Where are you going?

22:18.004 --> 22:19.372
I need to handle something.

22:19.472 --> 22:21.107
Do you want me
to come with you?

22:21.207 --> 22:22.675
I need to handle it myself.

22:23.643 --> 22:25.478
(sighs)

22:32.151 --> 22:34.554
Who are...?
(shushes)

22:40.860 --> 22:42.429
Who are the girls?

22:47.600 --> 22:49.436
I don't know.
Whoever we were out with

22:49.536 --> 22:51.370
when I was working
for Internal Affairs.

22:51.471 --> 22:53.606
Who is the one on your lap?

22:53.706 --> 22:54.707
Come on, Regina.

22:54.807 --> 22:57.910
Look at the date
on the photograph.

22:59.612 --> 23:02.081
I can't make it out.
What is it?

23:02.181 --> 23:04.584
It was my 16th birthday.

23:06.185 --> 23:09.388
That was my birthday,

23:09.489 --> 23:11.791
and you were with her.

23:11.891 --> 23:12.992
I was working, honey.

23:13.092 --> 23:14.594
You know

23:14.694 --> 23:16.996
what kind of crazy hours
I had to keep sometimes.

23:17.797 --> 23:21.868
(crying):
How long you gonna
keep doing this, Dad?

23:21.968 --> 23:22.769
It's true, though.

23:22.869 --> 23:24.370
I had to be around

23:24.471 --> 23:26.473
all kinds
of unsavory characters.

23:26.573 --> 23:31.410
Even on special days when
I should have been with you.

23:34.180 --> 23:36.382
Did you sleep with her?

23:36.749 --> 23:39.552
What kind of question
is that to ask me?

23:39.652 --> 23:41.554
Did you?

23:45.492 --> 23:47.426
(sniffles)

23:50.497 --> 23:52.398
Regina?
You...

23:53.566 --> 23:55.802
You stay away from me.

23:58.571 --> 24:00.640
R-Regina, come back here.

24:00.740 --> 24:02.842
Please.
(door closes)

24:11.851 --> 24:14.353
* *

24:18.525 --> 24:21.260
You know any of these girls
from back in the day?

24:26.833 --> 24:28.267
Yeah, I know, I know
all of them.

24:28.367 --> 24:30.269
There was a prostitute
stroll on Loring Avenue,

24:30.369 --> 24:32.605
and we used to periodically
do sweeps.

24:32.705 --> 24:34.907
Y-You'd collar the same
girls over and over again.

24:35.007 --> 24:38.511
Her name was Peaches.
That's Sharon.

24:38.611 --> 24:41.013
And this one here's Bunny.

24:42.582 --> 24:45.017
Thanks.
Yeah, I can
cross-reference nicknames,

24:45.117 --> 24:47.386
arrest records, photographs,
maybe come up with something

24:47.486 --> 24:48.955
i-if you're
looking for 'em.
No, that's all right, Marvin.

24:49.055 --> 24:51.290
I'll take care of it.

25:03.870 --> 25:05.772
Are you the officer in charge?

25:05.872 --> 25:07.206
How can I help you, ma'am?

25:07.306 --> 25:10.076
One of your officers
was so courteous.

25:10.176 --> 25:12.411
He gave me directions, then

25:12.511 --> 25:15.247
he actually walked me
to where I was going.

25:15.347 --> 25:16.683
Ah, well, isn't that something?

25:16.783 --> 25:18.250
I didn't get his name,

25:18.350 --> 25:20.419
but I did write down
his badge number

25:20.519 --> 25:23.322
as soon as I was back
on the tour bus.

25:25.858 --> 25:27.159
That right?

25:27.259 --> 25:29.662
We Red Hat ladies
recognize acts of kindness.

25:29.762 --> 25:33.966
We recognize when someone
takes pride in their work.

25:34.066 --> 25:35.301
Isn't it about time

25:35.401 --> 25:37.570
more people did that?
Absolutely.

25:37.670 --> 25:41.741
You have a blessed day,
Officer Kee. (chuckles)

25:41.841 --> 25:45.978
See? I'm gonna remember
to know your names from now on.

25:46.078 --> 25:47.546
Well, you have a blessed day,
too, ma'am.

25:55.922 --> 25:59.091
Hey. That woman Rita Albert,
whose place got broken into,

25:59.191 --> 26:00.426
she's out of the hospital.

26:00.526 --> 26:02.028
I heard.

26:02.128 --> 26:03.495
Yeah, she told the cop
outside her room

26:03.596 --> 26:05.598
that our fake cop said
he came to her apartment

26:05.698 --> 26:08.968
to check on her son's parole
status, but once he was inside,

26:09.068 --> 26:10.269
she caught him going
through her stuff

26:10.369 --> 26:12.805
before he
assaulted her.

26:12.905 --> 26:15.407
I'm just glad he didn't turn
out to be a real cop.

26:15.507 --> 26:17.543
Give people one more reason
to hate us.

26:17.644 --> 26:20.079
Yeah, Killian told me what
happened at your kid's school.

26:22.048 --> 26:23.650
Hard for an eight-year-old
to understand

26:23.750 --> 26:27.253
why his mother's presence
is a trigger.

26:27.353 --> 26:29.155
Yeah, same old story, you know,
people hating on cops

26:29.255 --> 26:30.489
till they need one.

26:30.589 --> 26:32.959
My son doesn't know
that people hate on cops.

26:33.059 --> 26:36.162
He still thinks
we're the good guys.

26:36.262 --> 26:38.631
What time does your son
get out of school?

26:39.666 --> 26:40.900
YENKO:
Our fake cop

26:41.000 --> 26:42.869
apparently took seriously
what it means

26:42.969 --> 26:44.103
to be of service.

26:44.203 --> 26:45.371
You mean, when he wasn't
doing robberies.

26:45.471 --> 26:46.673
YENKO:
So impressed
was one civilian

26:46.773 --> 26:47.807
that she took down

26:47.907 --> 26:49.308
his badge number.

26:49.408 --> 26:51.110
It corresponds
to a George Callas,

26:51.210 --> 26:52.544
who retired
from the job

26:52.645 --> 26:53.780
in 1998.

26:53.880 --> 26:55.114
We have an address?

26:55.214 --> 26:56.482
He's in Bay Ridge.
We got a sector car

26:56.582 --> 26:57.917
heading out that way
to pick him up now.

26:58.017 --> 26:59.919
Oh. There's progress.

27:00.019 --> 27:02.321
("Repeat" by Sways playing)

27:07.860 --> 27:09.295
* Hey, boy *

27:09.395 --> 27:11.597
* Bad up the beat, then repeat *

27:11.698 --> 27:14.566
* Trill OG, yeah, that's me,
that's a three-peat *

27:14.667 --> 27:17.103
* Victory, I gotta win,
can't defeat me *

27:17.203 --> 27:18.637
* Outta my... outta my league *

27:18.738 --> 27:20.439
* But she needy,
like, why she need me? *

27:20.539 --> 27:21.808
ANGELA:
Yeah, have a good day.

27:21.908 --> 27:23.442
KID:
Thank you.

27:23.542 --> 27:26.412
* Trill OG, yeah, that's me,
that's a three-peat *

27:26.512 --> 27:29.281
* Victory, I gotta win,
can't defeat me *

27:29.381 --> 27:31.317
* Outta my... outta my league,
but she needy *

27:31.417 --> 27:32.618
* Like, why she need me? *

27:32.719 --> 27:34.020
Angela.

27:34.120 --> 27:35.587
Yeah?

27:35.688 --> 27:37.523
I wonder if I could
talk to you for a minute.

27:37.623 --> 27:39.025
About what?

27:39.125 --> 27:41.293
Something that happened
26 years ago.

27:43.863 --> 27:46.733
I don't have a very good memory
for things that long ago.

27:46.833 --> 27:49.201
Does the name Yolo
Linden ring a bell?
Does not.

27:49.301 --> 27:51.804
Think back, Ms. Bridwell.

27:51.904 --> 27:53.039
You were in
a motel room

27:53.139 --> 27:55.842
on Atlantic Avenue
where Yolo Linden

27:55.942 --> 27:57.309
got shot to death.

27:57.409 --> 27:59.478
Look, lady, I don't know
what you're talking about.

27:59.578 --> 28:01.180
I'm a school crossing guard.

28:01.280 --> 28:02.281
You were a prostitute.

28:02.381 --> 28:03.482
You went by Bunny,

28:03.582 --> 28:05.284
and Yolo Linden
was your pimp.

28:05.384 --> 28:08.254
And the cop who killed him
is trying to get you

28:08.354 --> 28:10.156
to implicate my father

28:10.256 --> 28:12.058
in the murder.

28:13.225 --> 28:14.493
Your father Mo Haywood?

28:14.593 --> 28:16.262
Yes, he is.

28:18.664 --> 28:20.066
How is Mo?

28:21.067 --> 28:22.068
He's all right.

28:22.168 --> 28:23.669
He tell you to come talk to me?

28:23.770 --> 28:24.871
He doesn't know
anything about it.

28:24.971 --> 28:26.605
Then how you find me?

28:26.705 --> 28:28.908
Surveillance photograph
with three cops and three women.

28:29.008 --> 28:30.977
Two of the women are dead,
and you've been arrested

28:31.077 --> 28:32.144
enough times to leave a trail,

28:32.244 --> 28:34.981
so, you know.

28:35.081 --> 28:37.316
I don't get arrested
so much anymore.

28:41.320 --> 28:42.321
Kurt Walsh get in touch with you

28:42.421 --> 28:44.456
about your grand
jury appearance?

28:44.556 --> 28:45.958
I don't know any Kurt Walsh.

28:46.058 --> 28:47.593
Has he threatened you?

28:48.494 --> 28:51.730
I told you,
I don't know who he is.

28:59.772 --> 29:02.308
If anyone tries
to intimidate you,

29:02.408 --> 29:04.310
or is pressuring you to lie,

29:04.410 --> 29:06.779
you get in
touch with me,

29:06.879 --> 29:08.647
put a stop to it, okay?

29:10.482 --> 29:12.284
How you know
about the grand jury?

29:12.384 --> 29:15.521
Spoke to Sy Somers and
put two and two together.

29:22.161 --> 29:23.762
If Mo Haywood
was in on

29:23.863 --> 29:27.433
the killing of Yolo Linden,
you should say that.

29:28.634 --> 29:30.803
If he wasn't,
you should say that.

29:33.672 --> 29:36.075
When vice cops
would do sweeps,

29:36.175 --> 29:38.310
Sy Somers would get me released.

29:38.410 --> 29:41.914
Your father? He'd post my bail.

29:42.014 --> 29:45.517
Your father
pays Sy's fees.

29:46.518 --> 29:49.688
He's a good guy, your father.

29:50.857 --> 29:52.424
Come on, babies.

30:11.277 --> 30:14.613
There's something about the
smell of a precinct, you know?

30:14.713 --> 30:18.250
I started out at the 7-8,
went to the 1-14,

30:18.350 --> 30:20.419
then to the 2-6,
which was a blessing,

30:20.519 --> 30:23.655
since I was living in Nyack
at the time. (laughs)

30:25.091 --> 30:26.425
All smell the same.

30:26.525 --> 30:30.562
Yeah, well, um,
so, tell me-- does this guy

30:30.662 --> 30:32.731
look familiar?
(laughs) Yeah, that's Carl.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.000
Carl who?

30:34.100 --> 30:36.568
Carl Dannemeyer. Officer Carl.

30:36.668 --> 30:38.337
Why do you call him that?
He's a buff.

30:38.437 --> 30:41.273
Knows all the terminology,
had a scanner.

30:41.373 --> 30:42.808
To talk to him,
you'd think he was a cop.

30:42.909 --> 30:46.178
Uh, how'd he wind up
with your shield?

30:46.278 --> 30:48.347
I gave it to him. I had dupes.

30:48.447 --> 30:50.316
He told me it was
for a costume party,

30:50.416 --> 30:51.984
but I could see
how much it meant to him.

30:52.084 --> 30:55.054
He'd clip it to his jacket, wear
it on a chain around his neck.

30:55.154 --> 30:56.488
(laughs)

30:56.588 --> 30:58.524
I didn't have the heart
to ask for it back.

30:58.624 --> 31:00.392
He in some kind of trouble?

31:00.492 --> 31:02.528
It's a possible robbery.

31:03.595 --> 31:05.064
That'd surprise me.

31:05.164 --> 31:06.865
The guy I know

31:06.966 --> 31:08.000
is basically harmless.

31:08.100 --> 31:09.701
Hmm.
He'll be out there,

31:09.801 --> 31:12.204
uh, you know, directing traffic
in a snowstorm,

31:12.304 --> 31:14.340
helping an old person
cross the street.

31:14.440 --> 31:15.874
What'd he do for money?

31:15.975 --> 31:19.045
He'd been working as a doorman
in Brooklyn Heights.

31:19.145 --> 31:20.246
But he got let go.

31:20.346 --> 31:21.948
Had to move out
of his place.

31:22.048 --> 31:23.815
I felt for him.

31:23.916 --> 31:26.518
Let him store a bunch
of things in my garage.

31:26.618 --> 31:28.687
Can we take a look
at those things?

31:28.787 --> 31:29.788
Sure.

31:29.888 --> 31:31.357
YENKO:
What a collection.

31:31.457 --> 31:34.593
This French Connection poster
is signed by Eddie Egan.

31:34.693 --> 31:36.362
You know who he is?
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
he was the model

31:36.462 --> 31:37.529
for Popeye Doyle
that Gene Hackman...

31:37.629 --> 31:39.265
He was the model
for Popeye Doyle,

31:39.365 --> 31:41.833
who Gene Hackman
played in the movie.

31:41.934 --> 31:43.936
And there are all these
signed photographs

31:44.036 --> 31:45.604
of police commissioners.
Oh, look at this.

31:45.704 --> 31:47.273
Geez.

31:47.373 --> 31:50.109
Keechant Sewell,
Bill Bratton.

31:50.209 --> 31:51.443
(chuckles)
Ray Kelly.

31:51.543 --> 31:52.778
QUINLAN:
He collects them like

31:52.878 --> 31:54.680
they're baseball cards.
Yeah.

31:54.780 --> 31:56.682
Although, why are there so
many pictures of a cello?

31:56.782 --> 31:58.484
QUINLAN:
Oh, I can shine
some light on that.

31:58.584 --> 32:00.419
Please.
So, I went on

32:00.519 --> 32:02.488
the stolen property index,

32:02.588 --> 32:04.090
and there was a cello known
as the Steinmuller Stradivarius,

32:04.190 --> 32:07.426
and it was reported stolen
by the principal cellist

32:07.526 --> 32:09.361
of the Cleveland
Symphony Orchestra,

32:09.461 --> 32:10.963
and it looks a lot
like this one.

32:11.063 --> 32:13.565
See, that's interesting,
because Stradivarius

32:13.665 --> 32:15.634
was known primarily
for violins.

32:15.734 --> 32:17.936
Do we think Dannemeyer
stole the cello?

32:19.905 --> 32:22.408
Find out why he got fired
from his doorman job.

32:22.508 --> 32:25.277
Then, uh, last
known address,

32:25.377 --> 32:26.745
and if there are any
relatives, girlfriends

32:26.845 --> 32:28.780
who might be living
in the area, et cetera.

32:28.880 --> 32:30.516
And these guns are
pretty realistic-looking but

32:30.616 --> 32:32.684
they're all rubber, so
I'm guessing he's unarmed.

32:32.784 --> 32:34.153
Guess again.

32:34.253 --> 32:35.887
Real ammo.

32:42.828 --> 32:45.231
* *

32:47.633 --> 32:48.800
Carl's a beautiful person.

32:48.900 --> 32:50.102
I wish he was
still working here.

32:50.202 --> 32:51.437
Ah. Cleaning lady's upstairs,

32:51.537 --> 32:53.305
Mrs. Caponogro.
Thank you, Larry.

32:54.106 --> 32:55.741
Why isn't he still working here?
They caught him

32:55.841 --> 32:57.509
going into somebody's apartment
when the people weren't there.

32:57.609 --> 32:59.611
Yeah? They catch him
stealing anything?

32:59.711 --> 33:01.013
Not to my knowledge,

33:01.113 --> 33:01.980
but you can't be going
into people's apartments

33:02.081 --> 33:03.015
when they're not there.

33:03.115 --> 33:04.483
That's across the board.
Mm.

33:04.583 --> 33:05.617
What apartment?

33:05.717 --> 33:07.053
18D. Ashford's.

33:07.153 --> 33:08.420
Carl was convinced they had

33:08.520 --> 33:09.921
some kind of illegal
operation going on,

33:10.022 --> 33:11.157
and he was determined
to bust it up.

33:11.257 --> 33:12.658
Something about
a stolen cello.

33:12.758 --> 33:14.360
He was all set to be a hero
when they fired him.

33:14.460 --> 33:15.661
18D.

33:15.761 --> 33:16.828
Ashford.

33:16.928 --> 33:18.264
Yes, ma'am.

33:36.615 --> 33:38.917
I know that there's gonna
be all kinds of people

33:39.017 --> 33:41.220
hanging around
the courthouse.

33:41.320 --> 33:42.654
I was wondering
you come with me?

33:42.754 --> 33:45.491
They won't let me
in the grand jury room.

33:45.591 --> 33:49.928
Can you stay with me, at least,
till I get in there?

33:51.997 --> 33:53.999
Of course I can.

33:54.100 --> 33:57.203
Of course.
Uh, let me grab my coat.

34:02.774 --> 34:04.576
NEWSMAN (on TV):
Though supported by the mayor,

34:04.676 --> 34:07.045
Proposition H
had been questioned...

34:07.146 --> 34:08.480
How you doing?
Hey.

34:08.580 --> 34:09.715
Oh, no.

34:09.815 --> 34:11.449
coffee's on me, Officer.
The hell you doing?

34:11.550 --> 34:14.386
You know that's
attempted bribery?

34:14.485 --> 34:16.722
I'm just breaking your balls.
Put it in the tip jar.

34:16.822 --> 34:18.657
NEWSWOMAN: A Developing story,
Appreciate it.

34:18.757 --> 34:22.060
All New York News
reports from the scene.

34:22.161 --> 34:23.762
REPORTER:
A Brooklyn couple
has been arrested

34:23.862 --> 34:27.998
in connection with the theft
of the Steinmuller Stradivarius,

34:28.100 --> 34:30.402
one of only 60 cellos
in the world

34:30.502 --> 34:32.838
made by Antonio Stradivari,

34:32.938 --> 34:36.675
and valued between
three and four million dollars.

34:36.775 --> 34:39.378
The NYPD would like
to thank an alert doorman.

34:39.478 --> 34:42.181
Larry Simic spotted the cello...

34:42.281 --> 34:44.483
Larry Simic?
Did she just say Larry Simic?

34:44.583 --> 34:47.418
...to receive
a $50,000 reward...

34:47.518 --> 34:49.888
Larry Simic had nothing
to do with that.

34:49.987 --> 34:51.523
Nick and Shelly, back to you.

34:51.623 --> 34:52.958
NICK:
We'll be sure to bring you
more on this...

34:53.058 --> 34:54.426
Have a good night,
Charlie. Thanks.

34:54.525 --> 34:56.362
Don't let the cold hit you.

35:12.744 --> 35:14.146
Larry.

35:17.516 --> 35:20.452
I thought you were
a stand-up guy, Larry.
It's-it's not

35:20.552 --> 35:21.987
what you think, Carl. No.
It's not?

35:22.087 --> 35:23.422
It's not you taking credit
for what I done?

35:23.522 --> 35:25.457
Please... please
put the gun away.

35:25.557 --> 35:28.827
First, you and me are gonna
find this TV news person

35:28.927 --> 35:32.331
and you're gonna tell her
the truth on who did what.

35:33.799 --> 35:36.067
Put the gun down!

35:38.737 --> 35:41.106
CARL:
So, that news report
was to entice me? Nice.

35:41.207 --> 35:42.308
Up against the fence.

35:42.408 --> 35:43.309
I knew you were a cop.

35:43.409 --> 35:45.277
Oh, yeah? How's that?

35:45.377 --> 35:46.578
CARL:
It's in the eyes.

35:46.678 --> 35:48.480
Yeah, I knew you were
checking me out.

35:48.580 --> 35:50.015
I could tell you have
a heightened awareness

35:50.115 --> 35:51.317
of your surroundings.

35:51.417 --> 35:53.018
That's what it's all about
for a cop.

35:53.118 --> 35:54.953
Good to know you pass muster
with him.

35:55.053 --> 35:56.355
Hey, I'm old school.

35:56.455 --> 35:58.890
I used to be skeptical
of a woman on the job,

35:58.990 --> 36:00.192
but not anymore.

36:00.292 --> 36:01.193
Man, well, let me get
this straightened out,

36:01.293 --> 36:02.494
I'd work with you anytime.

36:02.594 --> 36:03.629
Oh, yeah? Great.

36:05.063 --> 36:06.298
Your new partner?

36:06.398 --> 36:07.299
Eh, think he'll work with me?

36:07.399 --> 36:09.501
Not sure.
Yeah.

36:10.336 --> 36:12.671
Great job, Larry.
(chuckles)

36:12.771 --> 36:14.206
Hell of a job, Larry.

36:14.306 --> 36:15.807
Hell of a job.

36:15.907 --> 36:18.477
Frickin' awesome.
(chuckles)

36:22.981 --> 36:26.252
I should be sitting where
you're sitting, you know that?
Just sit down.

36:29.388 --> 36:31.623
So, what happened?
I flunked the psych tests
at the police academy.

36:31.723 --> 36:34.660
Something about me being,
uh, delusional with narcissistic

36:34.760 --> 36:36.495
tendencies.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

36:36.595 --> 36:38.864
You talked your way
into the Albert woman's home.

36:38.964 --> 36:39.931
Mm-hmm.

36:40.031 --> 36:41.166
Why?
Her son was doing

36:41.267 --> 36:42.401
a brisk trade in
bootleg pharmaceuticals.

36:42.501 --> 36:45.003
I thought it was
time I shut it down.

36:45.103 --> 36:46.305
And then, when the woman

36:46.405 --> 36:47.806
tried to stop you,
you assaulted her.

36:47.906 --> 36:49.207
That was an accident.

36:49.308 --> 36:50.809
We're talking
Class A misdemeanor, right?

36:50.909 --> 36:52.411
That's a 120.00.

36:52.511 --> 36:53.812
Yeah, while in the commission
of a robbery.

36:53.912 --> 36:56.248
160.10, if you're putting it
in your notes.

36:56.348 --> 36:58.149
It doesn't rise to a 160.10.

36:58.250 --> 36:59.685
No way.
It wasn't a robbery.

36:59.785 --> 37:02.521
Carrying an unlicensed firearm
is a Class B felony.

37:02.621 --> 37:05.491
Impersonating a police officer
is a Class A felony.

37:05.591 --> 37:07.959
I wasn't impersonating
a police officer.

37:08.059 --> 37:09.127
I am a police officer.

37:09.227 --> 37:12.398
You're not a police officer.
Why?

37:12.498 --> 37:15.467
Why? Because my name's
not on the duty roster?

37:15.567 --> 37:17.002
It's not a job like
other jobs, you know.

37:17.102 --> 37:19.738
You don't punch in
and punch out.

37:19.838 --> 37:21.440
It's a calling.

37:21.540 --> 37:23.309
It's something you're put
on this earth to do.

37:23.409 --> 37:25.243
We should probably run him
over to the hospital

37:25.344 --> 37:26.478
for a psych evaluation.

37:26.578 --> 37:29.080
I don't need a
psych evaluation.

37:29.180 --> 37:31.116
I am completely clear in my mind

37:31.216 --> 37:32.918
on who I am and what it is
that I do.

37:33.018 --> 37:35.186
You know, the funny thing is,
it doesn't matter

37:35.287 --> 37:36.322
what other people think of us.

37:36.422 --> 37:37.723
There's no "us."

37:37.823 --> 37:39.791
Just as many people love us
as hate us.

37:39.891 --> 37:42.260
And whether they love us
or hate us,

37:42.361 --> 37:44.430
they all need us.

37:56.508 --> 37:58.344
A.D.A. Diskant.

37:59.411 --> 38:00.846
Inspector.
I was wondering

38:00.946 --> 38:02.781
when we're likely
to hear something.
We already heard.

38:02.881 --> 38:05.050
You can tell your father
he's in the clear.

38:05.150 --> 38:07.386
(indistinct chatter)

38:09.421 --> 38:10.856
Put him in the car.

38:10.956 --> 38:13.559
I guess Bunny's more afraid
of you than she is of me.

38:13.659 --> 38:15.627
Maybe unlike you,
she actually has a conscience.

38:15.727 --> 38:17.896
(chuckles)
That's all right.

38:17.996 --> 38:21.199
If I made it so that whenever
you think of your father,

38:21.299 --> 38:23.969
you think of him
with this whore,

38:24.069 --> 38:25.303
my work here is done.

38:25.404 --> 38:27.172
Dannemora's a cold place

38:27.272 --> 38:29.140
to be spending
the rest of your life, Kurt.

38:29.240 --> 38:30.576
Dress warm.

38:30.676 --> 38:33.712
Let's go, Walsh.
Let's go.

38:35.681 --> 38:37.182
* Yeah *

38:37.282 --> 38:39.651
* All right *

38:42.854 --> 38:44.022
* Yeah *

38:44.122 --> 38:46.892
* Four, five shooters
in a town *

38:46.992 --> 38:49.728
* When the streets
get cold, I'm... *

38:49.828 --> 38:51.162
SUAREZ:
Yeah, Chief. Uh,
I'll head over there

38:51.262 --> 38:53.231
as soon as I,
uh, leave the 7-4.

38:53.331 --> 38:56.201
Yes, sir.

38:56.301 --> 38:57.869
Good news about your dad?

38:58.970 --> 39:00.539
Looks like.

39:00.639 --> 39:02.774
Sometimes the truth
has a way of coming out,

39:02.874 --> 39:04.142
even without you
getting involved.

39:04.242 --> 39:07.479
Yeah, I'm glad I didn't have to.

39:07.579 --> 39:09.481
* The bottle *

39:09.581 --> 39:12.418
* Uh, trying to swallow
my pride *

39:13.251 --> 39:14.620
(school bell rings)

39:14.720 --> 39:16.287
* All right, all right... *

39:16.388 --> 39:17.856
How was school today?
All right.

39:17.956 --> 39:20.826
Anybody say anything about
Career Day yesterday?

39:20.926 --> 39:23.161
They don't think
you're really a cop.

39:23.261 --> 39:24.329
You told them I was,
though, right?

39:24.430 --> 39:26.398
They don't believe me.

39:26.498 --> 39:28.166
SANDEFORD (on P.A.):
Mr. Sebastian.

39:28.266 --> 39:30.602
(siren chirps)
KID: Whoa!

39:31.537 --> 39:33.171
Well, maybe now they will.

39:33.271 --> 39:34.606
Huh?

39:34.706 --> 39:36.174
We're getting a
special ride home.

39:36.274 --> 39:37.342
Come on.
SEBASTIAN: For real?

39:37.443 --> 39:39.611
(kids chattering)

39:39.711 --> 39:41.713
Hop in, young man.
You, too, young lady.

39:41.813 --> 39:45.651
Oh, my God.
(laughter)

39:50.388 --> 39:52.858
BOY:
That's so cool.

39:55.994 --> 39:57.262
Hey.
Your father's here, Inspector.

39:57.362 --> 39:58.997
Oh, no, tell him

39:59.097 --> 40:00.599
that I'm bus...

40:01.399 --> 40:03.301
It's all right.

40:11.677 --> 40:14.613
I am so grateful
for what you did, Regina.

40:14.713 --> 40:16.815
I am glad
that it all worked out.

40:16.915 --> 40:18.383
Might have been

40:18.484 --> 40:20.819
a very different outcome

40:20.919 --> 40:24.089
if you hadn't gone to bat
for me with that woman.

40:24.189 --> 40:26.324
"That woman"?
I think she deserves for you

40:26.424 --> 40:28.494
to at least call her
by her name.

40:31.396 --> 40:33.131
I made a mistake, honey.

40:33.231 --> 40:34.600
Back then, I made

40:34.700 --> 40:36.067
a lot of mistakes.
No.

40:36.167 --> 40:39.004
Parking in a tow-away zone,
that is a mistake.

40:39.104 --> 40:40.772
What you did
went way beyond that.

40:40.872 --> 40:42.474
See, this is why
I didn't want it

40:42.574 --> 40:43.675
to touch you.

40:43.775 --> 40:45.076
I didn't want
it to hurt you.

40:45.176 --> 40:46.545
But it did.

40:46.645 --> 40:48.780
You took your pleasures
where you found them,

40:48.880 --> 40:51.416
felt nowhere near enough shame
to put a crimp

40:51.517 --> 40:54.219
in your evenings
and went on your merry way.

40:54.319 --> 40:57.355
I am sorry, Regina, okay?

40:57.455 --> 40:59.491
You're sorry
I found out what you did.

40:59.591 --> 41:02.427
I knew you left us.

41:02.528 --> 41:05.497
I thought it was
the stress of the job.

41:06.765 --> 41:09.267
At the time and, uh,

41:09.367 --> 41:10.836
for years after,

41:10.936 --> 41:14.072
I thought it was, uh, demands

41:14.172 --> 41:16.942
that we made on you.
(short chuckle)

41:19.110 --> 41:21.479
I never thought
there was this woman--

41:21.580 --> 41:24.215
named Angela--

41:24.315 --> 41:26.084
who either put out

41:26.184 --> 41:29.521
or got sent to jail.

41:29.621 --> 41:31.022
It wasn't like that.

41:31.122 --> 41:33.592
Don't you dare
tell me what it was like.

41:41.767 --> 41:43.602
Hey.

41:48.574 --> 41:50.441
What can I do to make it right?

41:50.542 --> 41:52.911
Absolutely nothing.
