00:02.785 --> 00:04.352
[Jughead] Every town
has that one special place

00:04.395 --> 00:06.789
where its community
comes together.

00:06.832 --> 00:10.967
In Riverdale, that place is
Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe,
a home away from home.

00:11.011 --> 00:13.230
But the diner has had
a secret history as well.

00:13.274 --> 00:15.537
Across the decades,
it has been a battleground.

00:15.580 --> 00:19.236
Wars fought at Pop's have
shaped the town's identity.

00:19.280 --> 00:21.978
And, lo and behold,
another battle was brewing.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.588
[Alice on TV]
It is my great pleasure

00:23.632 --> 00:26.809
to introduce a dedicated
council member,

00:26.852 --> 00:32.249
selfless philanthropist,
and successful businessman,
Percival Pickens.

00:32.293 --> 00:33.903
Welcome, Percival.

00:33.946 --> 00:35.252
Thank you, Alice.
Delighted to be here.

00:35.296 --> 00:37.689
[Alice chuckles]

00:37.733 --> 00:40.170
So it's my understanding
that you have a game-changing
announcement

00:40.214 --> 00:41.911
for the future
of our fair town.

00:41.954 --> 00:43.695
That's right, Alice.

00:43.739 --> 00:45.219
I've been putting together
a project that I hope

00:45.262 --> 00:47.569
will galvanize
and revitalize Riverdale.

00:47.612 --> 00:50.224
A new privately-owned railway

00:50.267 --> 00:52.922
that will drive right through
the heart of Riverdale,

00:52.965 --> 00:56.621
bringing with it
much-needed jobs,
tourism, and revenue.

00:56.665 --> 00:59.189
What does he mean by
"through the heart
of Riverdale?"

00:59.233 --> 01:02.366
[Alice] So, would this
rail line have an official stop
here in Riverdale?

01:02.410 --> 01:04.064
[Percival]
Oh, absolutely, Alice.

01:04.107 --> 01:06.544
Are you familiar with
Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe?

01:06.588 --> 01:08.720
[Alice] Mm.

01:08.764 --> 01:11.158
Well, that would be
the most ideal central location
for a station.

01:11.201 --> 01:15.510
It would mean
bidding adieu to Pop's,
but progress demands it.

01:17.686 --> 01:20.776
I will never sell the diner
to you, ever.

01:20.819 --> 01:22.995
Well, that is disappointing.

01:23.039 --> 01:25.041
I had hoped
that as a council member,

01:25.085 --> 01:27.522
you'd be able to put
Riverdale's best interests

01:27.565 --> 01:30.655
above your own
personal, craven ones.

01:30.699 --> 01:34.920
Are you honestly going to deny
the economic, social,

01:34.964 --> 01:38.968
not to mention labor benefits,
this project would bring
to our town?

01:39.011 --> 01:41.623
To favor a diner that...

01:41.666 --> 01:43.973
let's be honest,
is well past it's heyday.

01:44.016 --> 01:47.498
I don't know what your angle is
with this sham train project,

01:47.542 --> 01:50.327
but the only person
it will benefit is you.

01:50.371 --> 01:53.287
Hmm. Well, your neighbors
may feel differently.

01:53.330 --> 01:56.899
They, in fact,
may want you to do
what's best for the town...

01:58.292 --> 02:01.033
[distorting]
and sell me that land.

02:01.077 --> 02:03.645
Hmm. Again, never.

02:04.907 --> 02:06.996
[Percival] Hmm.

02:07.039 --> 02:09.390
Archie, we can't
let Percival do this.

02:09.433 --> 02:11.566
Pop's is my family's legacy.

02:11.609 --> 02:13.872
The first Black-owned
business in Riverdale.
We have to fight him.

02:13.916 --> 02:16.919
Tabitha, I can't go up
against Percival right now.

02:16.962 --> 02:19.313
All right? He pummeled my ass.

02:19.356 --> 02:22.751
He knows my weakness.
So I'm sorry.

02:22.794 --> 02:25.057
Until I come up
with a workaround,
I gotta lay low.

02:26.058 --> 02:28.060
[sighs]

02:28.104 --> 02:29.366
[Betty] You need to
keep away from Percival.

02:29.410 --> 02:31.194
We all do. He's dangerous.

02:31.238 --> 02:34.763
He can get inside your head.
Get you to do things for him.

02:34.806 --> 02:39.289
And no matter what,
never ever be alone
in a room with him.

02:44.990 --> 02:47.210
You heard what Percival
said on TV, Toni.

02:47.254 --> 02:49.560
He's coming for Pop's now.
And if he's coming for Pop's,

02:49.604 --> 02:51.214
then he's coming
for the Whyte Wyrm too.

02:51.258 --> 02:53.260
Not exactly.

02:53.303 --> 02:55.566
He's claiming that
his new station wouldn't
affect the Whyte Wyrm.

02:55.610 --> 02:57.699
He's building above us,
where Pop's is,

02:57.742 --> 03:00.528
but supposedly we wouldn't
need to shut down for a day.

03:02.051 --> 03:03.270
Not that I believe him.

03:04.140 --> 03:05.185
[sighs]

03:08.405 --> 03:12.844
I'll support you in whatever
way you need, Tabitha,
but devil's advocate?

03:12.888 --> 03:17.458
Your satellite Pop's is doing
gangbusters business for us.

03:17.501 --> 03:19.721
Why not take the money
Percival's offering you

03:19.764 --> 03:23.899
and re-open a new and improved
diner in a much better,
safer location?

03:25.248 --> 03:27.207
[Cheryl] Dearest Tab-Tab...

03:27.250 --> 03:29.600
though I've missed most of
Percival's antics to date,

03:29.644 --> 03:32.951
I do agree he is a scourge
on this town,
as all Pickens men are.

03:32.995 --> 03:34.692
I will help you destroy him.

03:34.736 --> 03:36.912
Great.

03:36.955 --> 03:41.482
Just as soon as I learn
to control certain skills
I've been developing.

03:41.525 --> 03:46.008
I'm rather a work-in-progress,
as they say,
but I am getting there.

03:47.531 --> 03:48.706
[exhales]

03:50.099 --> 03:51.100
[sighs]

03:55.496 --> 03:57.106
Ah.

03:57.149 --> 03:58.629
Kevin.

03:58.673 --> 04:00.501
What news?

04:00.544 --> 04:02.285
Just as you predicted,

04:02.329 --> 04:04.548
Tabitha is trying
to rally support
for the Chock'lit Shoppe.

04:04.592 --> 04:06.463
Not getting much traction,
I'm hearing.

04:06.507 --> 04:09.466
Well, not yet,
but she's tenacious.

04:09.510 --> 04:13.165
Ultimately, she won't be able
to stop me, but she might
slow me down.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.951
That would be annoying.

04:15.994 --> 04:17.344
-Totally.
-Mm.

04:18.736 --> 04:19.563
Oh, well...

04:20.521 --> 04:22.784
I gave her a fair chance.

04:22.827 --> 04:24.960
[Tabitha] Percival's painted me
into a corner.

04:25.003 --> 04:26.918
To the point where
there's a part of me
that's started to wonder

04:26.962 --> 04:30.966
is it possible
his proposal is actually
what's best for the town?

04:31.009 --> 04:32.533
[Jughead] No. No way.

04:33.664 --> 04:36.450
Pop's has endured for a reason.

04:36.493 --> 04:38.103
It's Riverdale's anchor.

04:38.147 --> 04:40.192
People may have forgotten
about that, but it's true.

04:40.236 --> 04:42.064
Yes, but if you ask
those same people

04:42.107 --> 04:44.545
what would benefit
the town more,
Pop's staying open,

04:44.588 --> 04:48.462
or a bright,
shiny new railroad,
it's hard to argue.

04:48.505 --> 04:50.072
Not to mention,
how can I fight him

04:50.115 --> 04:51.900
if I don't have
anyone's support?

04:51.943 --> 04:53.249
[dishes clinking]

04:53.293 --> 04:54.816
You do have support.
I support you.

04:54.859 --> 04:56.296
[suspenseful music]

04:58.994 --> 05:00.125
How did you know
I was thinking that?

05:02.040 --> 05:03.172
I didn't say anything.

05:04.173 --> 05:05.827
Uh...

05:05.870 --> 05:08.786
You answered a direct question
that I was only thinking.

05:10.614 --> 05:13.008
Jughead, what's going on?

05:13.051 --> 05:16.316
And don't say "nothing"
because weird stuff has been
happening for a while now.

05:16.359 --> 05:17.317
Yeah.

05:19.319 --> 05:20.320
All right. Yeah.

05:26.282 --> 05:27.588
I have something to tell you.

05:27.631 --> 05:28.632
[intense music]

05:31.287 --> 05:32.636
Okay, so you can read thoughts.

05:32.680 --> 05:34.812
Betty can see
threatening auras.

05:34.856 --> 05:37.467
Archie is invulnerable
unless he comes into contact
with palladium.

05:37.511 --> 05:40.992
Cheryl is a fire starter,
and Percival can control
people's minds?

05:41.036 --> 05:41.906
[Jughead] Yes.

05:43.343 --> 05:44.953
But he didn't manipulate you...

05:46.781 --> 05:48.696
which is interesting.

05:48.739 --> 05:50.828
This all makes
a twisted kind of sense,
and not just with you,

05:50.872 --> 05:53.527
but just given
all of the interactions
I've been having lately.

05:53.570 --> 05:55.398
But...

05:55.442 --> 05:58.575
Look, I have an idea for how to
make the diner bulletproof.

05:58.619 --> 06:01.926
I tried it back in the day
when they were trying to
tear down the drive-in.

06:01.970 --> 06:05.756
We declare Pop's
a historical landmark, right?

06:05.800 --> 06:07.105
Then they can't bulldoze it.

06:07.149 --> 06:08.324
I mean, wouldn't...
wouldn't Percival

06:08.368 --> 06:10.108
and the council
just block that?

06:10.152 --> 06:11.936
No, you apply
for landmark status
at a state level,

06:11.980 --> 06:14.199
so it has nothing
to do with him.

06:14.243 --> 06:17.681
All we have to do is
prove that Pop's has
some historical significance.

06:19.291 --> 06:20.684
[Pop] This should
get you started.

06:20.728 --> 06:23.208
It's a box of keepsakes
and memorabilia

06:23.252 --> 06:26.168
that document the diner's
history over the decades.

06:26.211 --> 06:27.952
If there's an argument
to be made

06:27.996 --> 06:29.737
that Pop's is
a historic landmark
worth saving,

06:29.780 --> 06:31.521
it's in that box.

06:31.565 --> 06:33.697
-This is incredible.
Thank you, Pop.
-[Pop] Yeah.

06:36.570 --> 06:38.093
Oh, my gosh.

06:38.136 --> 06:40.312
[chuckles] This is a copy of
The Green Book.

06:42.663 --> 06:45.056
Once a safe haven,
always a safe haven.

06:51.236 --> 06:55.458
Hey. While we work,
how about a grilled cheese
and tomato soup for dinner?

06:55.502 --> 06:57.329
Yeah, that's great.

06:57.373 --> 07:00.550
Tabitha, this box
that Pop gave us
is like a time machine.

07:00.594 --> 07:04.554
Every significant event
in Riverdale happened here
at Pop's.

07:04.598 --> 07:06.687
Moral crises,
national tragedies,

07:06.730 --> 07:08.993
they all took place
inside these booths.

07:09.037 --> 07:12.170
The Rockland County
historical society is not
going to deny our application.

07:12.214 --> 07:13.345
That's great news.

07:13.389 --> 07:14.434
[diner bell jangles]

07:15.130 --> 07:16.740
[sinister music]

07:19.830 --> 07:20.962
[gun fires]

07:28.578 --> 07:30.841
["Jingle Bells" by Glenn Miller
and His Orchestra playing]

07:40.155 --> 07:41.417
[Titus] Hey, Teresa.

07:42.331 --> 07:43.985
We got 'em. [chuckles]

07:44.028 --> 07:46.117
Why did you just
call me Teresa?

07:46.161 --> 07:49.730
Oh, I still can't believe
that Pop's made it
into The Green Book.

07:49.773 --> 07:50.731
-[taps]
-[Tabitha] Oh.

07:51.732 --> 07:53.429
[Titus chuckles]

07:53.473 --> 07:55.300
[dramatic music]

07:57.999 --> 07:59.348
Hey, you mind
setting these out?

08:01.655 --> 08:02.656
Huh.

08:12.579 --> 08:13.405
Jughead!

08:14.711 --> 08:16.626
What the hell is going on?

08:16.670 --> 08:17.627
Where are we?

08:17.671 --> 08:18.585
When are we?

08:18.628 --> 08:20.064
Is it really 1944?

08:20.108 --> 08:24.329
Yes, Tabitha. It's 1944.

08:24.373 --> 08:28.116
The world is at war,
and Titus Tate...
is your great grandfather.

08:29.117 --> 08:30.553
Why did he call me Teresa?

08:30.597 --> 08:32.555
Why is he acting
like he knows me?

08:32.599 --> 08:34.731
It's how his mind is
comprehending your
sudden appearance.

08:34.775 --> 08:37.821
And also, I'm not Jughead.
I'm an angel.

08:37.865 --> 08:39.475
I'm your guardian angel.

08:39.519 --> 08:43.348
An angel who just happens
to look like my boyfriend?

08:43.392 --> 08:45.176
Well, I've assumed this form
because it's someone

08:45.220 --> 08:47.483
that you're comfortable with,
and someone you trust.

08:47.527 --> 08:51.226
If you saw my real form
in all its glory, you'd lose
your mind and go insane.

08:52.836 --> 08:54.055
I'm one of the good guys.

08:55.404 --> 08:57.232
My name is Raphael.

08:57.275 --> 08:58.668
Wait, is your name...

08:58.712 --> 08:59.887
is your name Raphael?

08:59.930 --> 09:01.889
It is.

09:01.932 --> 09:04.674
The real Jughead
is back in your time,

09:04.718 --> 09:06.546
by your bedside
in the hospital.

09:10.637 --> 09:13.640
I... I remember
Jughead and I were here,

09:13.683 --> 09:17.818
researching the diner
when some stranger came in...

09:17.861 --> 09:18.993
with a gun. He shot me.

09:19.036 --> 09:20.647
Jughead raced you
to the hospital.

09:20.690 --> 09:22.736
You're now on life support.

09:22.779 --> 09:26.783
If you are my guardian angel,
where have you been
all my life?

09:26.827 --> 09:28.959
Near you.

09:29.003 --> 09:31.614
We're only allowed to
show ourselves in times of
cataclysmic events

09:31.658 --> 09:34.225
or extreme cosmic significance.

09:35.270 --> 09:36.924
This qualifies.

09:36.967 --> 09:41.015
So, how or why did getting shot
catapult me to 1944?

09:41.058 --> 09:43.583
And how do I get back
to the present?
My present?

09:43.626 --> 09:45.802
I don't have all the answers.

09:45.846 --> 09:47.238
Only the Almighty does.

09:49.545 --> 09:51.025
Why don't you read this?

10:06.518 --> 10:09.130
Okay. So, according
to this book,

10:09.173 --> 10:12.089
I might be something
called "chrono-kinetic."

10:12.133 --> 10:13.874
Meaning you're a time traveler.

10:13.917 --> 10:15.963
Before I came here,
Jughead told me

10:16.006 --> 10:18.356
that the explosion
under Archie's bed,

10:18.400 --> 10:25.407
the shock of it had
unlocked certain abilities
in him, and Betty, and Archie.

10:25.450 --> 10:31.065
So, what if the trauma
of getting shot
unlocked my gift too?

10:31.108 --> 10:33.110
Sounds like
a very plausible theory.

10:33.154 --> 10:35.286
Except I didn't
do it consciously.

10:35.330 --> 10:37.114
It was like a reflex.

10:37.158 --> 10:40.074
The bullet hit me, and it...
and it triggered a time jump.

10:40.117 --> 10:42.424
But... why to 1944?

10:44.644 --> 10:46.036
Maybe you're needed here.

10:46.863 --> 10:47.777
For a mission.

10:49.692 --> 10:52.652
Well, the book didn't say
anything about a mission,

10:52.695 --> 10:55.306
but it did say I need a totem,

10:55.350 --> 11:00.050
a talisman, an object that
I can focus on in order to
hone my power to control it.

11:00.094 --> 11:04.751
And if I can do that, I might
be able to will myself
to return to my own time.

11:04.794 --> 11:06.100
So what's your totem?

11:06.143 --> 11:08.450
I have no clue.

11:08.493 --> 11:12.106
But it would have to be
an object of symbolic, mythic,
or religious power,

11:12.149 --> 11:14.325
to me or the world.

11:14.369 --> 11:16.980
Sounds like you could be
searching for years
for a needle in a haystack.

11:18.068 --> 11:19.156
Why don't you focus?

11:20.244 --> 11:21.681
On why you're here.

11:21.724 --> 11:23.726
My mission.

11:23.770 --> 11:26.381
Though you can't
or won't tell me what it is.

11:27.599 --> 11:29.645
Teresa, are you coming with me?

11:29.689 --> 11:31.081
Uh, where?

11:31.125 --> 11:33.083
To the community meeting
at the high school.

11:33.127 --> 11:37.131
To determine if Riverdale
should become a sundown town
or not.

11:37.174 --> 11:38.915
Come on.
This will decide our future.

11:43.528 --> 11:45.400
Titus didn't see you?

11:45.443 --> 11:46.967
No one can see me except you.

11:47.010 --> 11:49.839
And this... meeting...

11:49.883 --> 11:52.233
this is probably
my mission, right?

11:52.276 --> 11:54.626
Sounds a lot like it to me.
Yeah.

11:57.151 --> 12:00.241
Thank you all for coming
this close to the holiday.

12:00.284 --> 12:02.634
I know that this is
a contentious issue,

12:02.678 --> 12:06.377
and I wanted to give people
the chance to be able
to be heard

12:06.421 --> 12:08.075
before I make my decision.

12:08.118 --> 12:10.991
So I'd like to begin
with Sheriff Perkins.

12:11.034 --> 12:15.822
Now, you believe
that if Riverdale was to
become a sundown town,

12:15.865 --> 12:18.085
that this would
cut down on crime?

12:18.128 --> 12:19.826
Yes, Mayor Keller, I do.

12:19.869 --> 12:25.135
I mean, just look at Greendale,
Centerville, Seaside.

12:25.179 --> 12:29.009
Their crime rates plummeted
50% once they became
sundown towns.

12:29.052 --> 12:35.798
Sheriff Perkins, I think we'd
all appreciate knowing exactly
what these sundown laws entail.

12:35.842 --> 12:38.235
Well, it's quite simple,
Principal Cooper.

12:38.279 --> 12:41.238
All black people,
citizens or otherwise,

12:41.282 --> 12:44.372
must be outside the town limits
by sundown.

12:44.415 --> 12:47.201
If they aren't,
then they'll be treated
as trespassers.

12:47.244 --> 12:49.159
You can't possibly
be considering this.

12:52.423 --> 12:56.645
Besides the fact that you're
making the completely
racist assumption

12:56.688 --> 12:58.952
that only Black people
commit crimes.

12:58.995 --> 13:01.084
What about all the Black
families in town?

13:01.128 --> 13:03.608
The Black-owned businesses?
What are they supposed to do?

13:03.652 --> 13:05.610
How are they going to survive?

13:05.654 --> 13:08.700
Well, I don't believe
we've had the pleasure, miss...

13:08.744 --> 13:14.228
but if certain groups of people
can't abide by this
fairly straightforward law

13:17.057 --> 13:19.189
maybe those people ought to
move to a different town.

13:19.233 --> 13:21.452
Like hell.

13:21.496 --> 13:23.846
I did not fight in a war
to defend this country,

13:23.890 --> 13:26.849
to come back to a town
where people, any people,

13:26.893 --> 13:29.547
are not free and welcome
to come and go
as their God-given right.

13:29.591 --> 13:30.853
Thank you, Archie.

13:31.680 --> 13:32.942
It's Artie, miss.

13:34.726 --> 13:36.554
And not to mention

13:36.598 --> 13:39.035
five of the men
in my fire department
are Black.

13:39.079 --> 13:40.732
Now, they're friends of mine.

13:40.776 --> 13:42.952
They've saved countless
of our lives.

13:42.996 --> 13:44.954
[Mayor Keller] Fire Chief
Andrews and Sheriff Perkins,
I'll tell you what.

13:44.998 --> 13:47.435
Clearly I have a lot to
think about from this evening.

13:47.478 --> 13:51.656
So, if I suggest, you know,
take a step back,

13:51.700 --> 13:55.617
reconvene in the New Year,
and we'll settle this

13:55.660 --> 13:58.402
difficult matter
once and for all.

13:58.446 --> 13:59.839
How does that sound?

14:01.449 --> 14:03.843
Something is seriously
messed up here.

14:06.454 --> 14:08.848
To my knowledge, Riverdale
was never a sundown town.

14:08.891 --> 14:12.808
It's almost like someone is
trying to rewrite its history.

14:15.463 --> 14:17.030
And I think I know who.

14:17.073 --> 14:18.727
Sheriff Perkins.

14:18.770 --> 14:20.772
He has a counterpart
in my time, Percival Pickens.

14:20.816 --> 14:22.992
And he is evil.

14:23.036 --> 14:27.170
What if I'm meant to stop him?
To derail his plans.

14:27.214 --> 14:29.564
Maybe that's why
you were sent here.

14:29.607 --> 14:31.305
To this specific
moment in time.

14:31.348 --> 14:32.741
[frantic knocking on door]

14:32.784 --> 14:34.917
We need help. We need help.

14:34.961 --> 14:37.354
Please, they're coming for us.
We need help. We have a child.

14:37.398 --> 14:38.747
[baby crying]

14:39.443 --> 14:40.618
Thank you.

14:48.626 --> 14:49.801
Oh, thank you.

14:49.845 --> 14:51.934
[baby fusses]

14:51.978 --> 14:54.502
Our car ran out of gas
while we were
driving through Centerville,

14:54.545 --> 14:56.721
just as it was starting
to get dark.

14:56.765 --> 14:59.028
Centreville's a sundown town.

14:59.072 --> 15:02.118
We almost got caught
by the police, but we escaped
into the woods.

15:02.162 --> 15:04.729
And then we remembered
this diner.

15:04.773 --> 15:06.340
We'd read about it
in The Green Book.

15:07.254 --> 15:08.951
So we walked here,

15:08.995 --> 15:10.997
avoiding the roads.

15:11.040 --> 15:13.477
Do you think we can
maybe stay here a while?

15:13.521 --> 15:15.436
Just 'til the morning.

15:15.479 --> 15:18.700
And then we'll go
back to our car,
if it's even still there.

15:21.659 --> 15:25.489
It's Christmas Eve.
Of course you can stay.

15:26.838 --> 15:27.927
Thank you.

15:30.886 --> 15:32.844
[sirens continue blaring]

15:33.802 --> 15:34.890
Oh, my God.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.023
[police sirens blaring]

15:38.111 --> 15:40.156
It's okay.

15:40.200 --> 15:43.159
Stay calm. I will
go deal with them.

15:51.820 --> 15:53.996
Sorry, gentlemen,
but we're closed.

15:54.040 --> 15:56.085
[Sheriff Perkins] We're not
here for milkshakes, Miss.

15:56.129 --> 15:59.784
We understand you may be
harboring criminals
in this establishment.

15:59.828 --> 16:02.874
Our colleagues in Centerville
identified some trespassers

16:02.918 --> 16:05.877
in their town after dark,
gave pursuit.

16:05.921 --> 16:10.317
Last they saw, the criminals
were headed this way.

16:10.360 --> 16:12.449
Well, we don t have
any criminals here.

16:12.493 --> 16:15.409
Though we do have
a young family.

16:15.452 --> 16:18.890
But the last time I checked,
Riverdale was not yet
a sundown town.

16:18.934 --> 16:21.545
True, but Centerville is,
and they broke the law there,

16:21.589 --> 16:25.419
so those trespassers
are coming with us.

16:25.462 --> 16:27.769
And we'd be happy
to come in and get 'em.

16:27.812 --> 16:29.075
Do you have a warrant?

16:30.206 --> 16:32.034
No, I do not.

16:32.078 --> 16:36.125
Well, then,
you're not stepping foot
inside this diner.

16:36.169 --> 16:40.434
Because I know what happens
when people are arrested
for violating sundown laws.

16:40.477 --> 16:43.567
They vanish, and worse.

16:43.611 --> 16:45.700
Well, I think I'd like
to speak to your boss.

16:47.310 --> 16:48.529
I'm right here.

16:49.312 --> 16:51.619
[rifle cocks]

16:51.662 --> 16:55.536
And let me just reiterate,
no one is coming into my diner
without a warrant.

16:55.579 --> 16:57.407
Well, in that case,
if you don't mind,

16:57.451 --> 16:59.670
we'll just wait here
while I radio Centerville,

16:59.714 --> 17:01.324
have them draw up
that arrest warrant.

17:01.368 --> 17:03.500
It should be here
first thing in the morning,

17:03.544 --> 17:07.461
and we'll conclude
our business,
and justice will be done.

17:07.504 --> 17:10.420
Radio Centerville, Deputy,
and, uh, settle in.

17:12.074 --> 17:13.510
It's gonna be a long night.

17:16.644 --> 17:20.039
We bought ourselves
a few hours, but the second
that warrant arrives,

17:20.082 --> 17:22.606
there's no stopping
those lawmen from
forcing their way in here

17:22.650 --> 17:24.652
and taking you all away.

17:24.695 --> 17:27.002
What if we just snuck out
the back and made a dash
through the woods?

17:27.046 --> 17:28.569
I don't think
we can do that, Flynn.

17:28.612 --> 17:30.484
Baby Annie's asthmatic.

17:30.527 --> 17:32.877
-What if she has an attack?
-[sighs]

17:32.921 --> 17:35.532
We don't have her medicine.
We left it in the car.

17:35.576 --> 17:37.491
Damn. What we need is
a Christmas miracle.

17:40.407 --> 17:41.495
Yes.

17:45.629 --> 17:49.851
That's exactly what we need.

17:49.894 --> 17:52.114
I can't interfere directly.
It's one of the rules.

17:52.158 --> 17:54.856
It's Christmas Eve.
You're an angel.

17:54.899 --> 17:58.294
Isn't this the one night
of the year you can
and should get involved?

17:58.338 --> 17:59.643
What would you have me do?

17:59.687 --> 18:01.341
Something you said earlier.

18:01.384 --> 18:05.519
That if I saw your real form,
it would drive me insane.

18:05.562 --> 18:06.998
Did you mean that literally?

18:07.042 --> 18:09.131
Yes.

18:09.175 --> 18:11.394
Your eyes would start to bleed,
and your mind
would snap in two.

18:11.438 --> 18:15.572
Does that mean
the sheriff's mind
would snap in two as well?

18:16.921 --> 18:18.184
All right, I'll see
what I can do.

18:18.227 --> 18:20.664
Oh, thank you, Raphael.
Thank you.

18:20.708 --> 18:22.971
But just... give me a second.

18:23.014 --> 18:25.843
I want to call Chief Andrews,
and then I will bring
everybody back here.

18:28.063 --> 18:29.717
[Tabitha sighs]

18:29.760 --> 18:31.588
Hey, I told them
to hang back
away from the doors.

18:31.632 --> 18:32.981
You can't see this either.

18:33.024 --> 18:34.069
I won't.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.115
And thank you, Raphael.

18:44.819 --> 18:46.125
[doorbell jangles]

18:51.782 --> 18:53.044
[men screaming]

18:56.744 --> 18:58.963
Fire Chief Andrews is gonna
meet us and help get you home.

18:59.007 --> 19:01.444
But we have to
make a detour first.

19:01.488 --> 19:02.576
What happened to them?

19:07.363 --> 19:08.712
Come on, let's keep moving.

19:08.756 --> 19:12.760
Titus will call
and have them picked up.

19:12.803 --> 19:16.067
[Tabitha] I thought you'd be
here burning the midnight oil,
Mr. Mayor.

19:16.111 --> 19:19.288
It has been a restless
Christmas Eve for me.

19:19.332 --> 19:25.207
I didn't get a chance to
fully explain myself
at that meeting before.

19:25.251 --> 19:29.080
So I thought I'd introduce you
to some friends.

19:29.124 --> 19:34.216
This is Tracy, Flynn,
and their daughter, Annie.

19:36.087 --> 19:38.829
Tonight, they were hunted down
like criminals,

19:38.873 --> 19:41.049
for being caught in Centerville
after dark.

19:42.485 --> 19:45.096
They are why
you can't let Sheriff Perkins

19:45.140 --> 19:48.187
turn Riverdale
into a sundown town.

19:48.230 --> 19:52.191
It would cost Riverdale
its soul, Mr. Mayor.

19:55.629 --> 19:56.804
[swing music]

19:59.850 --> 20:01.591
That was Tracy.

20:01.635 --> 20:05.247
She and Flynn and baby Annie
made it home safe and sound.

20:05.291 --> 20:07.467
So I guess all's well
that ends well.

20:07.510 --> 20:09.817
But I have to
tell you something.

20:11.601 --> 20:15.301
My name's not actually Teresa.
It's Tabitha.

20:16.127 --> 20:18.304
And you...

20:19.914 --> 20:21.394
You're actually my...

20:21.437 --> 20:22.699
[door opens]

20:26.486 --> 20:29.880
You won't beat me,
so stop trying!

20:31.578 --> 20:32.535
[gunshot]

20:34.755 --> 20:37.148
[Martin Luther King, Jr.]
[on radio] And you know,
if I were standing...

20:39.629 --> 20:45.896
at the beginning of time
with the possibility
of taking...

20:45.940 --> 20:52.990
a kind of general
and panoramic view of the whole
of human history up to now...

20:53.034 --> 20:56.298
That's Dr. King.
His "Mountaintop" speech.

20:56.342 --> 20:58.561
...and the Almighty
said to me...

20:58.605 --> 21:04.437
Which means today is
April 3rd, 1968, and tomorrow
Dr. King's gonna be--

21:04.480 --> 21:06.700
Going to be what, Tina?

21:06.743 --> 21:08.615
I... I need to borrow
some money for the bus, Pop.

21:08.658 --> 21:10.878
I need to stop something
from happening.

21:11.574 --> 21:12.575
[hissing]

21:15.230 --> 21:17.363
Nothing from the mechanic yet?

21:17.406 --> 21:21.845
Nope. And this is gonna
take him two, three hours
to fix it. Which means...

21:21.889 --> 21:24.631
Well, we're not getting
to Memphis anytime soon.

21:24.674 --> 21:26.328
Is there another bus
I can take?

21:26.372 --> 21:29.157
To Memphis?
No, ma'am, this is it.

21:32.203 --> 21:33.814
-[sighs]
-[ringing]

21:33.857 --> 21:35.424
I know what
you're trying to do.

21:36.556 --> 21:39.733
Save Dr. King's life.

21:39.776 --> 21:43.650
But as painful as it is,
Tabitha, there's nothing
you can do about it.

21:43.693 --> 21:46.130
I don't accept that, Raphael.

21:46.174 --> 21:49.830
Betty once told me that
the FBI office in the Riverdale
opened up in the 1950s.

21:49.873 --> 21:50.874
Maybe they can help.

21:53.877 --> 21:55.618
[telephone ringing]

22:00.884 --> 22:02.538
Can we help you
with something, ma'am?

22:08.196 --> 22:10.459
[Tabitha] And if I tried
to call the Lorraine Motel?

22:10.503 --> 22:13.680
Where I know Dr. King
is staying tonight?

22:13.723 --> 22:18.598
The clerk wouldn't believe you,
or the line would cut out.
Or both.

22:18.641 --> 22:20.077
This isn't right.

22:20.121 --> 22:22.428
-Or just.
-I know.

22:22.471 --> 22:26.954
But some events are
fixed points in time.
In history.

22:26.997 --> 22:30.914
And sadly, this is one of them.

22:30.958 --> 22:36.137
Certain incidents from the past
affected the fabric
of the world so enormously

22:36.180 --> 22:38.922
that the universe won't
let them be altered.

22:39.749 --> 22:42.230
So what do I do?

22:42.273 --> 22:44.885
Is my mission
Percival-related again?

22:44.928 --> 22:47.191
You could try
and find your talisman.

22:47.235 --> 22:48.845
That's still out there.

22:48.889 --> 22:52.109
I can't imagine that I'll be
able to focus on anything

22:52.153 --> 22:55.983
other than what's
gonna happen tomorrow night.

22:56.026 --> 22:57.506
I'll wait with you, then.

23:02.859 --> 23:05.253
["I Wish It Would Rain"
by The Temptations playing]

23:05.296 --> 23:07.734
[news broadcaster]
Good evening. We interrupt
this broadcast with a message

23:07.777 --> 23:12.695
from Senator Robert Kennedy,
who is speaking to us
from Indianapolis.

a state of emergency,

in Riverdale
until further notice.

right now to grieve and pray.

give the FBI orders?

for our boss's help.
We were happy to oblige.

to us was shot down

He wants bloodshed.

He doesn't want us
to gather peacefully

and... and agitated,

for him and his thugs.

to fall into his trap.

After Percival vanished,
what did you do?

37:30.509 --> 37:35.731
I burned the entire shop down.
Except for the Grail.

37:35.775 --> 37:38.038
Percival's tried to get
a foothold in this town

37:38.081 --> 37:42.651
over and over again,
but you stopped him.

37:42.695 --> 37:46.612
Though I think, Tabitha,
it's time to focus
on getting back home.

37:46.655 --> 37:47.526
Your real home.

37:49.354 --> 37:52.270
I feel ridiculous even
saying this, but what if...

37:52.313 --> 37:54.663
the Grail isn't my talisman?
Then what?

37:54.707 --> 37:56.535
If it isn't,
then you keep looking.

37:57.840 --> 37:58.928
You keep fighting.

38:00.452 --> 38:01.540
But I'm hopeful.

38:06.066 --> 38:06.980
Drink up.

38:10.418 --> 38:11.332
To the future.

38:19.993 --> 38:21.037
[intense music playing]

38:33.354 --> 38:34.268
[grunts]

38:36.662 --> 38:38.620
What the hell?

38:38.664 --> 38:41.014
He's one of Percival's goons.

38:41.057 --> 38:43.451
Though he may not remember that
when he regains consciousness.

38:43.495 --> 38:45.801
But he came here to kill us.

38:45.845 --> 38:48.543
Well, me, at least.

38:49.762 --> 38:51.285
Well, what am I missing?

38:51.329 --> 38:53.200
A lot. [breathing heavily]

38:53.243 --> 38:55.637
I think it's my turn
to do the explaining.

38:57.639 --> 38:59.598
After we tie him up
and stick him in the freezer.

39:03.079 --> 39:04.429
You're a time traveler?

39:04.472 --> 39:06.387
I'm chrono-kinetic.

39:06.431 --> 39:11.958
-Yes.
-With the help of an angel?

39:12.001 --> 39:16.092
Why didn't I get an angel,
or Betty, or Archie, or Cheryl?

39:16.136 --> 39:19.966
I think I was
being trained, Jug.

39:20.009 --> 39:23.012
For a war that has been brewing
for decades, if not centuries.

39:23.056 --> 39:25.450
And its major battles
are still ahead of us.

39:25.493 --> 39:27.408
War?

39:27.452 --> 39:30.324
-As in--
-There was the same villain
in every time period,

39:30.368 --> 39:32.413
who was always hellbent
on destroying everything

39:32.457 --> 39:35.111
that was good, and fair,
and decent in Riverdale.

39:35.155 --> 39:36.678
Percival.

39:36.722 --> 39:40.073
He kept turning up
like the ultimate bad penny.

39:40.116 --> 39:44.556
Look, I'm not sure what he is,
but I do not think he is human.

39:44.599 --> 39:47.472
He's like the personification
of evil, and it's gonna
take all of us,

39:47.515 --> 39:51.824
all of us with powers,
working together to stop him.

39:54.783 --> 39:56.698
[Cheryl] I'm confused.

39:56.742 --> 39:59.135
If, in the past,
pesky Percival has wanted
to destroy Riverdale,

39:59.179 --> 40:01.877
then why is he bringing
a railroad to the town now?

40:01.921 --> 40:03.836
Well, we don't think
that's his ultimate goal.

40:03.879 --> 40:05.838
[Archie] Though he's
making it happen.

40:05.881 --> 40:07.492
I overheard my Uncle Frank
talking to someone
on the phone.

40:07.535 --> 40:09.581
Maybe your mom, Betty.

40:09.624 --> 40:12.801
Percival's trying to get
Governor Dooley on board
with this train plan,

40:12.845 --> 40:14.803
blocking any attempt
to landmark Pop's.

40:14.847 --> 40:17.197
Because Pop's is where
the resistance will gather.

40:17.240 --> 40:19.504
Where the forces of good
will marshal,

40:19.547 --> 40:22.158
where the final battle
will be fought, and he wants
to wipe it off the map.

40:22.202 --> 40:24.291
Tabitha, how do you know
all of this?

40:24.334 --> 40:28.426
Well, once I finally
figured out what
my time-talisman really was,

40:28.469 --> 40:29.992
I got better
at time-jumping.

40:30.036 --> 40:33.126
Wait. Your talisman
wasn't the Grail?

40:33.169 --> 40:36.390
No. Pop's was
my talisman all along.

40:36.434 --> 40:38.566
It was like Dorothy
and the ruby slippers.

40:38.610 --> 40:41.700
This diner is my personal,
limited-functioning
time needle.

40:41.743 --> 40:43.876
Makes sense.

40:43.919 --> 40:45.878
All of us have our tethers
that allow us
some semblance of control.

40:45.921 --> 40:47.749
Pop's would be yours.

40:47.793 --> 40:50.665
Okay, but... but wait.
Tabitha back up.

40:50.709 --> 40:53.407
Right. So, it took me
a minute to get the hang
of time-jumping.

40:53.451 --> 40:58.804
But once I did, I tried moving
forward into the future
instead of backwards.

40:58.847 --> 41:02.155
[Tabitha] In the future,
the diner was an empty shell.

41:02.198 --> 41:05.593
Even worse, outside,
the sky was full of ash.

41:05.637 --> 41:09.858
And as far
as the eye could see,
Riverdale was just gone.

41:09.902 --> 41:11.207
A wasteland.

41:13.253 --> 41:15.342
Is this future
definitely going to happen?

41:15.385 --> 41:17.344
Or is it something
we can change or stop?

41:18.650 --> 41:21.130
I don't know.

41:21.174 --> 41:23.002
Certain events
are fixed points in time,

41:23.045 --> 41:26.222
and the future I saw
might be one of them.

41:26.266 --> 41:30.531
But make no mistake,
it is the apocalypse
we're talking about.

41:30.575 --> 41:34.274
In Riverdale. And we are
sitting at ground zero.
