00:03.128 --> 00:06.631

You said you wanted to...see me.

00:06.715 --> 00:08.550

[gulps, chatters]

00:10.468 --> 00:12.220
Problem--a big one.

00:12.303 --> 00:15.306
- No, no, just a quick trip
to the salon,

00:15.390 --> 00:17.517
and they'll wax that off
in a jiffy.

00:17.600 --> 00:21.187

00:25.483 --> 00:26.943

ah-ah-ah--difficult.

00:27.026 --> 00:29.154
- I have it at home.
I can go get it.

00:29.237 --> 00:30.488
- Oh, wait, but first I have
to tell you something

00:30.572 --> 00:32.031
really, really important.
- What?

00:32.115 --> 00:34.951
- [chattering]

00:35.034 --> 00:36.911
- Andi, help.
What is she trying to say?

00:36.995 --> 00:39.122
- How would I know?
I don't speak monkey.

00:39.205 --> 00:42.459
I only speak Chihuahua...
and a little bulldog.

00:42.542 --> 00:45.128

Was it Maddie?

00:48.173 --> 00:48.256

00:50.467 --> 00:54.012

Lily, what were you
trying to tell me?

01:05.648 --> 01:08.443
Maybe you can
act it out for me?

01:08.526 --> 01:11.321
You wanted to say
that we need to run around,

01:11.404 --> 01:14.491
hop up and down,
hide under the desk--

01:14.574 --> 01:17.243
- Hey, Sherlock,
she's just being a monkey.

01:17.327 --> 01:20.830
- But whatever she wanted to say
sounded very important.

01:20.914 --> 01:23.082
- Ah, how do you know?
- Because she said,

01:23.166 --> 01:26.044
"I need to tell you
something very important."

01:26.127 --> 01:27.545
We can fix this.

01:27.629 --> 01:29.964

Excellent.

02:55.341 --> 02:56.426
Why do you ask?

02:56.509 --> 02:58.177
- You were just
in the nurse's office.

02:58.261 --> 02:58.928
You don't have
that bad of a cold, do you?

02:59.012 --> 03:01.806

- Uh...yeah.

03:17.447 --> 03:19.282
She's...getting a shot,

03:19.365 --> 03:22.911
and she was nervous,
so I came with her.

03:22.994 --> 03:25.622
Yes.
That is what's going on.

03:25.705 --> 03:27.248
- Listen.
I'm glad I ran into you.

03:27.332 --> 03:30.919
Because a bunch of us are going
to the beach after school,

03:31.002 --> 03:33.630
and I wanted to see
if you want to--

03:33.713 --> 03:34.964
- Hey, Emma.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.258
Um, you need to get in here
right now.

03:39.218 --> 03:40.553
- Hey, Andi,
stay strong, all right?

03:40.637 --> 03:41.262
You can do it.

03:41.346 --> 03:43.306
- Uh, okay, whatever.

03:43.389 --> 03:43.473
Uhh!

03:45.350 --> 03:46.935
- Uh, beach.
A bunch of people.

03:47.018 --> 03:47.352
Love to.
See you then.

03:52.023 --> 03:53.149
Now, where did you hide her?

03:53.232 --> 03:55.818
- Ah, calm down.
She's right over--

04:01.741 --> 04:02.825
Over--

04:04.160 --> 04:06.579
Um...

04:06.663 --> 04:08.164
I swear, she was right there.

04:08.247 --> 04:10.166
I mean--
- Two minutes.

04:10.249 --> 04:11.876
I left you with the monkey
for two minutes,

04:11.960 --> 04:12.919
and this is what you do?

04:13.002 --> 04:14.504
- Look, I was
just trying to help.

04:14.587 --> 04:15.672
I gave her a bana--
She's really strong, man.

04:15.755 --> 04:17.589
I don't know
how she opened that window.

04:17.673 --> 04:19.425
- What if somebody finds her?

04:19.509 --> 04:20.510
She's my Guardian.

04:20.593 --> 04:22.595
- Look.

04:22.679 --> 04:23.846
You can just, you know,

04:23.930 --> 04:26.432
use your thing,
and we'll get her right--

04:26.516 --> 04:28.434
- Andi, help me find her!

04:28.518 --> 04:31.938
- It had to be a monkey.
Emma and Andi had a monkey.

04:32.021 --> 04:32.981
- No way.

04:33.064 --> 04:34.524
- Well, if it looks
like a monkey,

04:34.607 --> 04:36.234
smells like a monkey,
and sounds like a monkey...

04:36.317 --> 04:37.986
- It only sounded
like a monkey.

04:38.069 --> 04:39.779
I didn't see
or smell any monkey.

04:39.862 --> 04:41.364
- That's too bad.
I love the smell of monkey.

04:41.447 --> 04:43.032
- Why would Emma
even have a monkey?

04:43.116 --> 04:46.119
- Ha. Who cares?
But if she does,

04:46.202 --> 04:47.745
I hope she brings it
to the beach.

04:49.956 --> 04:52.709
- I know something
you don't know.

04:52.792 --> 04:54.377
Sorry. Just always
wanted to say that.

04:54.460 --> 04:56.212
- Well, what is it?

04:56.295 --> 04:58.923
- Sounds like your spell worked.

04:59.007 --> 05:00.883
There's a monkey in the school.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.385
- Even if we do find her,

05:02.468 --> 05:04.095
I don't know how I'm going to
change her back.

05:04.178 --> 05:06.389
- Why don't you just do your...

05:06.472 --> 05:07.348
[snaps fingers]

05:07.432 --> 05:08.891
And reverse the spell?

05:08.975 --> 05:10.685
- Remember what Lily said
before she went full monkey?

05:10.768 --> 05:14.022
It's really hard to reverse
another witch's spell.

05:14.105 --> 05:16.649
I need the <i> Hexoren.</i>

05:16.733 --> 05:18.568
- Oh, I like this version
of Emma:

05:18.651 --> 05:22.196
daring, bold, staring danger
straight in the eyes--

05:22.280 --> 05:25.658
- Yeah, yeah, just cover for me
if anyone asks where I am.

05:25.742 --> 05:28.077
Especially--
- Your dad.

05:28.161 --> 05:31.414
- Exactly.
- No, I mean, your dad.

05:32.290 --> 05:35.418
- Oh, no. Quick.
Act casual.

05:37.462 --> 05:39.338
- Why aren't
you girls in class?

05:39.422 --> 05:41.340
- Oh, we have a really good

05:41.424 --> 05:43.259
explanation for this.

05:43.342 --> 05:44.469
Go ahead, Emma,

05:44.552 --> 05:46.971
tell him our
really good explanation.

05:47.055 --> 05:50.349
- Well,
Andi wasn't feeling well,

05:50.433 --> 05:52.769
so I walked her
to Nurse Lily's office.

05:52.852 --> 05:55.354
- And what was wrong with you?

05:55.438 --> 05:56.105
- She had...

05:56.189 --> 05:58.816
indigestion.
- Ebola.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.443
What she said.
[both laugh nervously]

- [chatters]

06:02.070 --> 06:02.862
- What was that?

06:02.945 --> 06:05.907

real itchy and--

06:05.990 --> 06:09.410
[coughs, mimics chattering]

06:09.494 --> 06:11.954
In fact, I'm not so sure
I don't have Ebola.

06:12.038 --> 06:13.790
I think I need to go back
to the nurse's office.

06:13.873 --> 06:15.750
- Great.
I'll go with you.

06:15.833 --> 06:17.085
- Not so fast.

06:17.168 --> 06:18.086
I'll take Andi.

06:18.169 --> 06:20.004

06:43.528 --> 06:45.488
- Oh, you don't need to text me
to tell me where you are.

06:45.571 --> 06:46.948
I found you.

06:47.031 --> 06:48.241

He's texting Emma.

06:48.324 --> 06:49.492
- Oh.
- Okay.

06:49.575 --> 06:50.827
- Really?

06:50.910 --> 06:52.578
Well, that's a great idea.

06:52.662 --> 06:53.704
She's new in town.

06:53.788 --> 06:55.623
She might not be able
to find us.

06:57.917 --> 06:59.210
- Uh...

06:59.293 --> 07:00.628
- You were awfully nice

07:00.711 --> 07:03.089
about Daniel texting Emma
right there.

07:03.172 --> 07:04.757

she's not going to get

07:04.841 --> 07:06.384
any of his text messages.

07:08.094 --> 07:11.681
Emma hasn't learned her lesson
and won't leave us alone,

so turn my phone
into Emma's phone.

07:14.267 --> 07:17.270

get in trouble.

"Too busy for you.

of spells in this book.

I think I can do it.

I felt the Ebola coming again.

And she called in sick.

09:15.346 --> 09:17.390
- Wish me luck.

09:25.856 --> 09:27.942
- You and I need to talk.

09:28.025 --> 09:29.694
- About what?

09:29.777 --> 09:31.320
- You know what.

09:31.404 --> 09:33.906
- I have no idea what you mean.

09:33.990 --> 09:35.574
- You need to change her back.

09:35.658 --> 09:37.326
- Change who back to what?

09:38.744 --> 09:41.330
- Oh, so it wasn't you

09:41.414 --> 09:43.082
who turned Nurse Lily
into a monkey?

09:44.875 --> 09:46.168
Huh.

09:46.252 --> 09:48.296
I guess you're not as amazing
of a witch as I thought.

09:48.379 --> 09:50.840
- Of course it was me.

09:50.923 --> 09:52.008
I did it.

09:52.091 --> 09:53.926
I am that amazing.

09:54.010 --> 09:54.844
- I knew it!

09:54.927 --> 09:57.555
You shouldn't have done that.

09:57.638 --> 09:59.181
Now change her back.

09:59.265 --> 10:02.685
- If you're so desperate,
then why didn't you just do it?

10:02.768 --> 10:03.394
- I've tried.

10:03.477 --> 10:05.855
I'm not sure I know how.

10:05.938 --> 10:09.567
- So you can't
reverse my spells?

10:10.776 --> 10:13.279
I'm stronger than you.

10:13.362 --> 10:14.530
I'm a better witch.

10:14.613 --> 10:18.492
Who's the Chosen One now?

10:18.576 --> 10:20.578
- How do you know
about the Chosen One?

10:20.661 --> 10:23.539
- I know way more
about witch...

10:23.622 --> 10:26.375
stuff than you do.

10:26.459 --> 10:27.877
Wait.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.837
How do you know about it?

10:29.920 --> 10:31.881
- It's in that book,
the <i> Hexoren.</i>

10:31.964 --> 10:32.798
- [gasps]

10:32.882 --> 10:34.467
I knew it!
You have it!

10:34.550 --> 10:35.176
And the nurse is helping you.

10:35.259 --> 10:37.762
So not fair.

10:37.845 --> 10:39.889
- Do it, okay?
- [sighs]

10:39.972 --> 10:42.600
I'll break my own spell
if you give me the Hexogram.

10:42.683 --> 10:44.727
- Lily wouldn't want me
to make that deal,

10:44.810 --> 10:47.563
even if it means she
stays a monkey a little longer.

10:47.646 --> 10:49.357
- Or forever.

10:49.440 --> 10:50.232
Good luck turning
your precious nurse

10:50.316 --> 10:53.194
back into a human.

10:53.277 --> 10:56.405
My spells are unbreakable.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.240
- I'll find a way.

10:58.324 --> 11:00.034
It's probably in the Hexogram.

11:00.117 --> 11:02.912
I mean, the <i>Hexoren,</i>
and I have that.

11:02.995 --> 11:04.288
- Not for long.

11:04.372 --> 11:07.541
I've waited and waited
as long as I can stand.

11:07.625 --> 11:09.710
Make the <i>Hexoren</i>
appear in my hand.

11:12.421 --> 11:13.881
[sighs]
What gives?

11:13.964 --> 11:16.592
I even got the name of the book
right this time.

11:16.675 --> 11:18.886
- How many times
have you tried that?

11:18.969 --> 11:22.223
- Only...a couple.

11:22.306 --> 11:23.682
- Uh-huh.

11:23.766 --> 11:25.476
- But this'll be the first time
I try this one.

11:25.559 --> 11:28.354
- Daniel!
- Daniel?

11:28.437 --> 11:29.772
- Hey, Maddie.

11:29.855 --> 11:30.940
Emma.

11:31.023 --> 11:35.277
- Walk me to class,
just like old times?

11:35.361 --> 11:38.155
- Sure.
Let's go.

11:38.239 --> 11:39.365
See you.

11:39.448 --> 11:40.866
- [chattering]

11:45.788 --> 11:49.208
- Okay.

11:49.291 --> 11:52.253
[crash]
Hey, careful in there.

11:52.336 --> 11:54.255
You better not be trying on
any of Emma's clothes.

11:54.338 --> 11:58.134
[cell phone rings]

12:01.095 --> 12:03.222
[feigning congestion]
Hi, Mom.

12:03.305 --> 12:05.433
Yeah, I'm still feeling
pretty sick.

12:05.516 --> 12:08.144
That Ebola virus
is a real doozy.

12:08.227 --> 12:10.271
[coughs]

12:10.354 --> 12:12.815
Oh, I didn't go home because...

12:12.898 --> 12:16.986
the school's nurse
happens to be here.

12:17.069 --> 12:21.323
Yeah, she's a friend
of Emma's family.

12:22.658 --> 12:25.161
You did?

12:25.244 --> 12:27.663
And it said what?

12:27.746 --> 12:30.166
But--
Okay, but--

12:30.249 --> 12:31.792
Fine.

12:32.626 --> 12:34.837
Yeah, we're busted.

12:34.920 --> 12:37.173
Looks like
we're going to school.

12:45.931 --> 12:47.349
- [chatters]
- She looked it up.

12:47.433 --> 12:49.393
Told you you could find anything
on the internet.

12:57.401 --> 13:00.321
- Hi, Daniel.

13:00.404 --> 13:02.281
- Hey.

13:02.364 --> 13:04.116
- I wanted to--
- Look.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.076
I'm kind of busy right now.

13:06.160 --> 13:07.536
- You are?

13:07.620 --> 13:11.207
- Yeah,
I'm reorganizing my locker.

13:11.290 --> 13:13.834
It's a very detailed
and time-consuming process.

13:13.918 --> 13:14.960
- Sure.
Sure.

13:15.044 --> 13:15.753
I totally understand.

13:15.836 --> 13:18.047
I reorganize mine once a week--

13:18.130 --> 13:19.965
Twice if it's been
a really busy week.

13:22.343 --> 13:25.888
I just wanted to apologize
for yesterday.

13:25.971 --> 13:29.558
Things were just really,
um...bananas.

13:29.642 --> 13:32.019
And I'm so sorry I missed

13:32.102 --> 13:34.522
hanging out at the beach
with you.

13:34.605 --> 13:37.191
There is nothing
I would have wanted to do more.

13:42.112 --> 13:42.905
- Emma, wait.

13:45.950 --> 13:47.243
- Yes?

13:47.326 --> 13:48.911
- What happened?

13:48.994 --> 13:52.164
Why were you so, like,
you know...

13:52.248 --> 13:53.415
- Oh, no.

13:53.499 --> 13:56.085
- "Oh, no," what?

13:56.168 --> 13:56.627
- Nothing.
I--

13:56.710 --> 13:58.671
I got to go.

13:58.754 --> 14:00.923
- Well, wait, wait, wait, wait.
What's going on?

14:01.006 --> 14:03.050
- Sorry.
It's an emergency.

14:03.133 --> 14:06.220
But next time, I promise,

14:06.303 --> 14:08.013
I'll make it to the beach.

14:10.975 --> 14:12.434
- What if Mrs. Doyle
checks to see

14:12.518 --> 14:13.519
if we really are
going to the nurse's office

14:13.602 --> 14:15.771
and finds out we aren't?

14:15.854 --> 14:17.273
- There's no way for them
to find out

14:17.356 --> 14:19.942
since the nurse is...
now, wait.

14:21.527 --> 14:23.279
Is that who I think it is?

14:23.362 --> 14:25.322
- Stop her, Sophie.

14:25.406 --> 14:26.490
- Move.

14:26.574 --> 14:28.993
- Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

14:29.076 --> 14:30.035
- I hate that game.

14:30.119 --> 14:31.996
I never get it right.

14:32.079 --> 14:33.455
- I say we hold
this monkey hostage

14:33.539 --> 14:36.333
and deliver her to Maddie.

14:36.417 --> 14:38.127
Then she won't be mad
at me anymore.

14:38.210 --> 14:38.961
Yeah.

14:42.298 --> 14:44.717
- Hey.

14:46.635 --> 14:48.137
I wanted to talk to you
about something.

14:48.220 --> 14:49.555
- For the last time,

14:49.638 --> 14:50.723
we're not changing our names
to the Copperfields.

14:50.806 --> 14:52.308
- No, no, no, no, no.
- That's that.

14:52.391 --> 14:54.810
- It's not about that.

14:54.893 --> 14:56.604
It's about Emma.

14:58.522 --> 14:59.898
- What about Emma?

15:01.567 --> 15:02.484
- Well...

15:02.568 --> 15:05.779
I know you guys
kind of had a thing,

15:05.863 --> 15:08.157
but she's been
really nice to me lately.

15:08.240 --> 15:09.867
And you know,
we're both magicians,

15:09.950 --> 15:12.661
so we're kind of
already compatible, so--

15:12.745 --> 15:14.413
- You want to ask her out.

15:15.664 --> 15:17.333
- Only if you don't.

15:21.253 --> 15:21.670
- No, man.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.839
Go for it.

15:23.922 --> 15:25.549
- [sighs]
Thanks.

15:25.633 --> 15:28.010
<i>MAN: ♪ Oh, oh, oh ♪</i>

15:34.433 --> 15:36.393
- Maddie?

15:36.477 --> 15:38.854
Fancy running into you here.

15:38.937 --> 15:41.148
- What are you doing here?

15:41.231 --> 15:42.399
- Uh...

15:42.483 --> 15:45.486
I was called in to
a parent/teacher conference.

15:45.569 --> 15:47.571
- Oh, yeah?

15:47.655 --> 15:48.822
With who?

15:48.906 --> 15:53.369
- With Mr--Ms. Smith.

15:53.452 --> 15:57.081
- You came here to see
Mr. Alonso, didn't you?

15:57.164 --> 15:59.708
- I came here
to see all your teachers.

15:59.792 --> 16:02.628
He just happens
to be one of them.

16:02.711 --> 16:04.672
Besides,
I'm doing this for you.

16:04.755 --> 16:08.342
I realized that the <i>Hexoren</i>
is probably in their house.

16:08.425 --> 16:10.511
- Why don't you just show up
at their house with a pie

16:10.594 --> 16:11.720
and freak them out like you did

16:11.804 --> 16:14.348
to every other witch family
in Miami!

16:14.431 --> 16:16.058
- Shouldn't you be in class?

16:16.141 --> 16:17.559
- This is school.

16:17.643 --> 16:20.604
You have no authority
over me here.

16:20.688 --> 16:22.272
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
Hello.

16:22.356 --> 16:26.777
This girl is not in class,
and I want her prosecuted

16:26.860 --> 16:27.403
to the fullest extent
of the law.

16:27.486 --> 16:29.863
- Mom!

16:29.947 --> 16:31.532
- Ta-ta, Maddie Winky.

16:31.615 --> 16:33.909
- "Ta-ta, Maddie Winky."

16:34.660 --> 16:35.828
- [panting]

16:35.911 --> 16:38.872
Andi, thank goodness
I found you.

16:39.957 --> 16:42.376
What's going on here?

16:42.459 --> 16:44.586
- We're holding Nurse Lily
until Maddie gets here.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.046
- That's monkey-napping.

16:46.130 --> 16:49.550
- No, it's answering
when the opportunity knocks.

16:49.633 --> 16:52.511
- [scoffs]

16:52.594 --> 16:54.847
Wait, but where's Nurse Lily?

16:55.931 --> 16:57.850
- She was feeling
very misunderstood,

16:57.933 --> 16:59.268
so she took off.

16:59.351 --> 17:00.352

17:03.480 --> 17:06.442
[glass clinking,

17:06.525 --> 17:07.358
- Do it again.
- What?

17:07.443 --> 17:10.279
- The fireball thing.
- Shh!

17:10.362 --> 17:10.988
Not here.

17:11.070 --> 17:12.948
What if somebody sees?

17:13.031 --> 17:14.157
- They'd probably think
it's awesome.

17:14.241 --> 17:18.412
In fact, I bet
you could get a lot of girls.

17:18.494 --> 17:19.621
Yeah.

17:19.704 --> 17:20.580
- Really?

17:20.664 --> 17:23.083
- Absolutely.

17:23.166 --> 17:24.292
Now, go talk to--

17:24.376 --> 17:25.502
[chuckles]
Hey.

17:25.586 --> 17:27.671
Penny Dawson.

17:27.755 --> 17:30.799
Rub your hands together,
and watch her swoon.

17:31.508 --> 17:32.468
Yeah, yeah.

17:32.551 --> 17:34.720
- Okay.

17:37.806 --> 17:38.932
[chuckles]

17:39.016 --> 17:39.975
I'm ready.

17:40.058 --> 17:40.267
- Yes, you are.

17:48.317 --> 17:50.402
- Want to see something cool?

17:50.486 --> 17:51.570
Watch.

17:52.738 --> 17:55.949
- [gasping]
What's happening to your hands?

17:56.033 --> 17:56.074
- Sorry.
Sorry.

17:57.743 --> 17:58.827
- Good job.

17:58.911 --> 18:01.663
- What did you throw on me?

18:02.748 --> 18:05.417
- Well, where is she?

18:05.501 --> 18:06.835
- [laughs]
That's the thing.

18:06.919 --> 18:10.380
We sort of lost her.
[laughs]

18:10.464 --> 18:11.590
- You what?

18:11.673 --> 18:12.132
- It was Sophie's fault.

18:12.216 --> 18:15.511
- [laughing]

18:17.554 --> 18:18.388
We're not laughing anymore?

18:18.472 --> 18:20.349
- No!

18:20.432 --> 18:22.643
I can't believe you lost her.

18:22.726 --> 18:24.186
Come on, let's go find her.

18:27.648 --> 18:29.274
I have a treat for you.

18:29.358 --> 18:32.694
- Here, Nurse Lily,
Lily, Lily.

18:35.614 --> 18:37.533
- We have to get to Lily first.

18:37.616 --> 18:39.910
- You better hope
I get that monkey first.

18:39.993 --> 18:41.286
- Let's go
check the nurse's office,

18:41.370 --> 18:44.456
since that's, like,
home base for Lily.

18:44.540 --> 18:46.708
- We should look outside.
- The monkey bars!

18:55.259 --> 18:57.970
- Sharks!
Ready?

18:58.053 --> 18:58.220
- We sure are, Coach.

18:59.805 --> 19:02.891
- What are you wearing?

19:02.975 --> 19:05.769
- Oh, it's, uh,
my lucky sweater.

19:05.853 --> 19:07.187
I just found it in my basement

19:07.271 --> 19:10.399
and figured it was
the perfect time to bust it out.

19:10.482 --> 19:14.236
- Is that made of, uh...

19:14.319 --> 19:15.195
[sneezes]

19:17.614 --> 19:18.156
Wool?

19:18.240 --> 19:19.616
[bottle clatters]

19:22.953 --> 19:24.371
- It's frozen.

19:29.167 --> 19:31.253
- I'm glad you asked me
to stop by.

19:31.336 --> 19:32.963
- I didn't.

19:33.046 --> 19:33.839
- Because I personally
wanted to invite you

19:33.922 --> 19:36.091
to join my book club.

19:36.174 --> 19:37.426
- That's very nice of you.

19:37.509 --> 19:40.304
What kind of books do you read
in your book club?

19:40.387 --> 19:42.097
- Oh, all sorts:

19:42.180 --> 19:45.058
fiction, non-fiction, mystery,

19:45.142 --> 19:47.853
non...
mystery...

19:47.936 --> 19:50.898
and my personal favorite,
poetry.

19:50.981 --> 19:52.107
- You like poetry?

19:52.190 --> 19:55.152
- Oh, yes, especially
the kind that rhymes.

19:55.235 --> 19:55.944
- I love poetry too.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.822
Okay, who is your favorite poet?

19:58.906 --> 20:02.284
- Uh, Dr. Seuss?

20:02.367 --> 20:03.827
- [laughs]

20:03.911 --> 20:05.621
[both laugh]

20:05.704 --> 20:07.122
- I love Dr. Seuss too.

20:07.205 --> 20:09.666
I used to read all his books
to Emma when she was younger.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.043
- Well, perfect.

20:11.126 --> 20:12.628
We'll see you tonight then
at 7:00.

20:12.711 --> 20:14.296
- Actually, tonight is

20:14.379 --> 20:16.256
make-your-own-pizza night
at our place.

20:16.340 --> 20:17.758
- Oh, great.

20:17.841 --> 20:21.136
We would love to have make-
your-own-pizza book club night

20:21.219 --> 20:22.721
tonight at your house.

20:22.804 --> 20:23.722
I'll bring the pepperoni,

20:23.805 --> 20:25.432
and you find
every book in your house

20:25.515 --> 20:28.602
that has anything
to do with rhyming whatsoever.

20:28.685 --> 20:30.854
- Okay.
- Okay.

20:30.938 --> 20:32.356
- Fine.

20:32.439 --> 20:34.358
- Perfect.

20:34.441 --> 20:35.651
Thank you.

20:41.615 --> 20:42.866
- Aha!
There you are.

20:42.950 --> 20:44.576
[chuckles]

20:44.660 --> 20:47.537
- Aww!
Are you afraid to come down?

20:47.621 --> 20:49.122
- She's a monkey, Emma.

20:49.206 --> 20:50.374
She's not afraid of...

20:54.378 --> 20:54.419
Heights.

20:57.631 --> 20:59.591
[kids scream]

21:06.431 --> 21:08.558
- A Kanay...

21:08.642 --> 21:10.269
in my school.

21:10.352 --> 21:12.771
- If he is a Kanay,
we could be in serious trouble.

21:14.189 --> 21:17.192
- Sorry to barge in,
but we have a big problem.

21:17.275 --> 21:19.278
There's a monkey loose
in the school.

21:19.361 --> 21:20.821
- A what?
- A monkey.

21:20.904 --> 21:23.281
- I called animal services.
They should be here any minute.

21:23.365 --> 21:26.326
- You called them
without my permission?

21:26.410 --> 21:27.619
- Yeah, it's standard practice.

21:27.703 --> 21:29.997
We need to evacuate the school
until they get here.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.373
- I'll decide that.

21:31.456 --> 21:33.834
Julio,
get me the student manual.

21:33.917 --> 21:36.586
- I already have it,
and he's right.

21:36.670 --> 21:37.921
We need to evacuate.

21:42.092 --> 21:43.385
- Everybody, out.

21:43.468 --> 21:45.137
Evacuate.
Evacuate.

21:45.220 --> 21:46.096
[panting]

21:46.179 --> 21:48.598
This is a monkey emergency!

21:49.683 --> 21:52.269
- You got to do something.
Change her back.

21:52.352 --> 21:53.895
- Last time I tried,
it didn't work.

21:53.979 --> 21:56.231
- I think the monkey's
in the cafeteria.

21:56.314 --> 21:58.108
- Emma, you're not
supposed to be here.

21:58.191 --> 22:01.653
- Hurry.
Go, go, go!
