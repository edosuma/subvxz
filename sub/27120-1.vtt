Um, do you have any loose
change in your car maybe?

04:44.251 --> 04:45.586
- Did you really
just say that to me?

04:45.586 --> 04:48.722
- I did, I did just say
that to you, kidding.

04:48.722 --> 04:50.190

04:50.190 --> 04:53.226
tortilla flavored espressos

05:02.903 --> 05:05.005
You don't have to.

06:27.287 --> 06:30.090

06:31.258 --> 06:32.693
- Yeah, I'll bring

06:32.693 --> 06:34.227
I'm pretty sure he'll

06:34.227 --> 06:36.464
- Cool, well listen,

Hey, hey Joe.

You get popped, pop.

Pop, pop, time, dude, take

Shit.

07:42.262 --> 07:43.864

- Hi.

07:43.864 --> 07:45.132
Thank you for coming here.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.334
- No problem, um this is
my paralegal, Danielle.

07:47.334 --> 07:50.638
- Sorry, just
juggling my other job

07:50.638 --> 07:53.040
and school, and it
really takes its toll.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.675
- We understand,
it's no problem.

07:57.611 --> 07:58.979
- Here are all my pay
stubs and everything

07:58.979 --> 08:00.180
from the past two years.

08:01.915 --> 08:04.017
- Fantastic.

08:04.017 --> 08:05.252
- Will they help?

08:05.252 --> 08:07.054
- Absolutely, now
your ex-boss has not

08:07.054 --> 08:08.556
tried to contact you in any way

08:08.556 --> 08:10.023
since we last spoke?

08:10.023 --> 08:11.659
I need for you to take
pictures of these for me.

08:11.659 --> 08:13.594
- No I haven't really
been back since.

08:13.594 --> 08:16.363
I just, I don't feel
very comfortable.

08:16.363 --> 08:18.632
- It's okay, I'm going to need

08:18.632 --> 08:20.701
some of your co-workers
to give some testimonies.

08:20.701 --> 08:21.902
Will that be okay?

08:21.902 --> 08:23.370
- I can call around
tomorrow, but--

08:23.370 --> 08:24.605
- Okay.

08:24.605 --> 08:25.539
- They're not gonna
get in trouble, right?

08:25.539 --> 08:26.473
- No, no, absolutely not.

08:26.473 --> 08:27.474
- Okay.

08:27.474 --> 08:28.408
- Do you have that?

08:28.408 --> 08:29.643
Do you need some help?

08:29.643 --> 08:30.678
I need you to take
these pictures.

08:34.047 --> 08:35.582
- Hey.
- Hi.

08:35.582 --> 08:38.785
- Sorry I'm late, I
was comin' from work,

08:38.785 --> 08:41.221
and then I had to
change in my car

08:41.221 --> 08:42.856
and then people
started watchin' me

08:42.856 --> 08:44.424
and I'm just, I'm
not a fan of it.

08:44.424 --> 08:45.659
- I know that struggle.

08:45.659 --> 08:47.861
- So what made you
decide bowling?

08:47.861 --> 08:51.599
- I used to be on a
championship bowling team.

08:51.599 --> 08:53.100
Junior league, fifth grade.

08:53.100 --> 08:54.868
- Okay, fifth grade.
- Mm-hmm.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.503
- That was a minute ago,
that was a while ago.

08:56.503 --> 08:59.206
- Yeah, it's been a
while, but I never lose.

09:08.381 --> 09:09.850
This never happens.

09:09.850 --> 09:12.019
- It doesn't, usually
I suck at bowling.

09:12.953 --> 09:14.087
- I've had enough out of you.

09:14.087 --> 09:15.355
- You won the first three games,

09:15.355 --> 09:16.523
just be happy with that, right?

09:16.523 --> 09:18.158
- Yeah, but I'm supposed
to win every game.

09:19.226 --> 09:20.894
- You're really
competitive, aren't you?

09:20.894 --> 09:21.829
- Yes, I am.

09:36.476 --> 09:38.712
- Keep him on the rope, nice.

09:38.712 --> 09:40.648
Stay tight, stay
to the right, Luis.

09:40.648 --> 09:41.982
Stay on him, come on!

09:41.982 --> 09:43.784
- How's our boy doin'?

09:43.784 --> 09:45.986
- You know, he's
doin' all right.

09:45.986 --> 09:47.621
He's okay, oy!

09:49.389 --> 09:50.791
- All right.
- come on, stay there.

09:50.791 --> 09:52.192
- Tell Ricky I
wanna see him, okay?

09:52.192 --> 09:53.026
- Yes, sir.

09:54.161 --> 09:55.663
Come on, throw that body kick.

09:58.298 --> 10:01.101
There, see, see?

10:01.101 --> 10:02.469
Shit.

10:02.469 --> 10:03.904
All right, get out of there.

10:03.904 --> 10:04.972
Joe wants to see you.

10:09.677 --> 10:12.212
- Hi Ricky, hey, take
a seat, take a seat.

10:12.212 --> 10:13.346
- Yeah, I got you.

10:21.221 --> 10:23.657
- Everybody thinks
you're doin' well.

10:23.657 --> 10:25.158
Rudy thinks you're doin' well.

10:25.158 --> 10:27.094
He won't forget his head, but
he thinks you're doin' well.

10:27.094 --> 10:29.663
You won the last few
fights, you won 'em well.

10:31.064 --> 10:34.001
Just wanna bring you in
here and give you some news.

10:34.001 --> 10:35.268
- Okay.

10:35.268 --> 10:38.972
- News is that I still
think you fuckin' suck.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.841
Your elbow strikin' sucks,
your knee strikin' sucks,

10:40.841 --> 10:42.642
your whole inside
game, it fuckin' sucks,

10:42.642 --> 10:44.111
all right, you've got
this thing, Ricky,

10:44.111 --> 10:45.345
you've got this thing, you know,

10:45.345 --> 10:48.248
you have this blind
spot on your left side,

10:48.248 --> 10:49.750
you understand?
- I know.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.018
- Last guy you were fightin',

10:51.018 --> 10:52.252
if he'd had any
kind of right hook

10:52.252 --> 10:53.687
he would've fuckin'
knocked you out.

10:53.687 --> 10:54.855
- I know, I know.
- I don't know what it is,

10:54.855 --> 10:56.256
can you see out of that eye?

10:56.256 --> 10:57.958
- I can see, yeah, I can see.

10:59.292 --> 11:01.261
I'll take care of
it, no worries, okay.

11:02.295 --> 11:04.297
- Oh, oh.
- What's up?

11:06.466 --> 11:08.535
- Matador Promotions called.

11:08.535 --> 11:09.636
You got a title fight.

11:11.404 --> 11:13.406
- You're lying to me.

11:13.406 --> 11:16.409
- I'm not, hey it's
fuckin' legit, Ricky.

11:16.409 --> 11:18.145
We start camp tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

11:18.145 --> 11:20.413
- Tomorrow, the Rudy, all right?

11:20.413 --> 11:21.715
We're gonna watch some tape,

11:21.715 --> 11:23.250
get some strategy together.

11:23.250 --> 11:24.251
- Who am I fighting?

11:25.385 --> 11:29.156
- It's Manny.
- He's tough.

11:29.156 --> 11:32.059
- Just take tonight, I
want you to indulge, okay?

11:32.059 --> 11:33.493
- Yeah.

11:33.493 --> 11:34.728
- All right, well we haven't
got the contract yet,

11:34.728 --> 11:35.929
it's just an offer,
but when we get it

11:35.929 --> 11:36.930
we'll sign it and
take care of business.

11:36.930 --> 11:37.464
- Yes, sir.
- Tomorrow?

11:37.464 --> 11:38.832
- Sir.

11:38.832 --> 11:41.068
- Hey, one more thing.
- Yeah.

11:41.068 --> 11:44.537
- Manny, last opponent,
knocked him out.

11:44.537 --> 11:45.873
Right hook, okay, okay.

11:45.873 --> 11:47.374
- I saw it, I saw
it, I remember.

11:47.374 --> 11:48.641
- All right, gotta work on that.

11:48.641 --> 11:49.810
- I'll take care of it.

11:49.810 --> 11:50.610
I got you.

11:51.745 --> 11:53.346
- Title fight,
title fuckin' fight.

11:53.346 --> 11:54.414
- [Ricky] Title fight!

12:12.265 --> 12:15.268
- People shouldn't do that.

12:15.268 --> 12:17.938
- Dude, man, so this
title fight, man,

12:19.106 --> 12:21.909
dude how do you feel,
has it hit you yet?

12:21.909 --> 12:25.612
- Like four times,
it's pretty big,

12:25.612 --> 12:27.480
it's a pretty big step.

12:27.480 --> 12:28.849
- Hey Rick.
- Yeah.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.985
- You know you about to get
your ass whooped, right?

12:31.985 --> 12:34.321
You know that, right?

12:34.321 --> 12:35.488
- That's not right at all.

12:38.191 --> 12:39.592
He's tough, he's tough.

12:39.592 --> 12:40.593
- Yeah, man, we're
talkin' about Manny, dude.

12:40.593 --> 12:41.929
- Yeah.
- This is Manny,

12:41.929 --> 12:43.263
man, he's good, man.

12:43.263 --> 12:44.898
- He is tough.
- He is good.

12:44.898 --> 12:46.099
- He killed a man once.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.101
- Really?
- No, but still.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.136
- Oh man, don't
be playin' with me

12:49.136 --> 12:50.303
like that, Rick, come on, man.

12:50.303 --> 12:51.872
- He's that good.

12:51.872 --> 12:53.706
- Hey man, he's the
champ for a reason.

12:56.076 --> 12:57.277
You know what, man?

12:57.277 --> 13:00.147
This is the moment
you've been workin' for.

13:00.147 --> 13:02.682
The two a days, man,
the three a days, man,

13:02.682 --> 13:04.484
all the times you've
gone at it, man,

13:04.484 --> 13:07.420
it's all been
worth it, you know?

13:07.420 --> 13:08.989
I mean, the throwin' up on me,

13:08.989 --> 13:11.291
yeah, I ain't forgot, yeah, man.

13:13.994 --> 13:16.096
- Ah, my bad.
- It's all worth it.

13:16.096 --> 13:17.330
- Yeah.

13:17.330 --> 13:18.598
- I got you, that's
what I'm sayin', man,

13:18.598 --> 13:20.500
you're not alone
in this, you know?

13:20.500 --> 13:22.635
You got me, you got Rudy,
you got everybody, man,

13:22.635 --> 13:24.071
we here for you.

13:24.071 --> 13:25.305
- Yeah.

13:25.305 --> 13:26.639
- Me and you tomorrow,
man, five a.m. sparrin'.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.408
- Five a.m.
- Hey man, if you throw up

13:28.408 --> 13:31.578
on me again, I get a free
kick to your face, fair?

13:31.578 --> 13:32.812
- Yeah, that's fair.

13:32.812 --> 13:33.480
- Yeah, all right,
all right, man.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.281
- That's fair.

13:39.887 --> 13:43.623
- So, thanks for taking me
to a dead rosebush garden.

13:47.394 --> 13:50.763
- So how long exactly
have you been a paralegal?

13:50.763 --> 13:51.965
- Well, I've been, I still have

13:51.965 --> 13:53.500
about two more years
of school left.

13:53.500 --> 13:58.338
- Okay, and you actually
like law school?

13:58.338 --> 14:00.107
- It's a lot of studying.

14:00.107 --> 14:02.876
- Yeah, that's pretty
much all school, right?

14:02.876 --> 14:06.179
- Yeah, well law school
a little bit more than--

14:06.179 --> 14:09.382
- Careful.
- Thank you for the catch.

14:09.382 --> 14:11.518
- Yeah, no more
dancing on trees, yeah.

14:12.652 --> 14:14.687
- I'm a tree nymph,
I can't help it.

14:15.989 --> 14:18.458
- I still don't
understand the difference

14:18.458 --> 14:20.493
between a paralegal
and a lawyer, though,

14:20.493 --> 14:22.295
and I know you told
me three times.

14:24.264 --> 14:27.100
- There are a lot of
things that are different.

14:27.100 --> 14:29.369
Paralegals cannot
offer legal advice,

14:29.369 --> 14:31.905
and we cannot appear
as counsel in court,

14:33.273 --> 14:34.407
to keep it basic.

14:37.010 --> 14:40.147
- Okay.
- It's very different.

14:41.848 --> 14:43.083
- No, I believe you.

15:31.798 --> 15:33.033
- All right
gentlemen, this is it.

15:33.033 --> 15:34.834
- Hey, Joe, what's goin' on?

15:34.834 --> 15:36.936
- Hey Rudy.
- Oh, thanks.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.705
- Five to show,
three to win, Ricky.

15:38.705 --> 15:41.108
This is the time to stand up
and make a name for yourself.

15:41.108 --> 15:42.309
- Oh wow, this is it?

15:42.309 --> 15:44.777
Is that my contract?
- That is your contract.

15:44.777 --> 15:47.180
- Five to show, three to win.

15:47.180 --> 15:48.448
Oh man, look at that weight.

15:48.448 --> 15:49.382
- What's the weight?

15:49.382 --> 15:51.951
- Good thing we got six weeks.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.453
- What's the weight?

15:53.453 --> 15:54.687
- You need to get down.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.056
- He's ready, Rudy?
You ready, Ricky?

15:57.024 --> 15:58.525
- Is he ready?

15:58.525 --> 16:01.328
No, not yet, but can he do it?

16:01.328 --> 16:02.929
Definitely.

16:02.929 --> 16:04.364
You earned this here,

16:04.364 --> 16:06.666
some people never
get this opportunity.

16:06.666 --> 16:08.001
What does that mean?

16:08.001 --> 16:10.237
That means if you
think you did enough,

16:10.237 --> 16:12.539
I mean, clearly you've
done enough to get here,

16:12.539 --> 16:13.873
but now that means
you've gotta take it

16:13.873 --> 16:15.808
to the next level
in all aspects.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.510
K, that means you
have to breathe,

16:17.510 --> 16:19.712
you have to sleep,
you have to eat,

16:19.712 --> 16:21.148
you have to shit, you
have to do everything

16:21.148 --> 16:23.316
that's related to
fighting, you understand?

16:23.316 --> 16:27.487
No distractions
whatsoever, nothing.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.189
- We deal in
champions here, okay?

16:30.190 --> 16:31.158
Are you a champion?

16:34.094 --> 16:35.895
- I can do this.
- You can do this.

16:35.895 --> 16:37.497
- All right, I hope
we get a title.

16:37.497 --> 16:38.498
Sign it, have it
back on my desk.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.033
- All right.
- All right?

16:40.033 --> 16:42.335
Listen to Rudy, he's your
be all and end all, right?

16:42.335 --> 16:45.004
Remember what I said about
the left guard, okay?

16:45.004 --> 16:46.439
He's got a fuckin'
killer right hook.

16:46.439 --> 16:48.308
- Hey, no more burritos,
Ricky, all right?

16:48.308 --> 16:49.809
No more, no more of that shit.

16:51.378 --> 16:55.148
- Congratulations, I'm
proud of you homes.

16:55.148 --> 16:56.583
- What the hell am I doin'?

16:56.583 --> 16:58.285
- Neither have I, I
mean it looks nice

16:58.285 --> 16:59.619
and I've driven past it,

16:59.619 --> 17:01.488
but I just, hello.

17:02.555 --> 17:04.523
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

17:06.059 --> 17:07.560
Do you mind if I could get

17:07.560 --> 17:09.529
a second glass of water, please?

17:09.529 --> 17:12.065
- Is there something
wrong with this one?

17:12.065 --> 17:14.767
- No, I just like to have two.

17:17.337 --> 17:19.372
- Oh, certainly.

17:19.372 --> 17:20.173
- Thanks.

17:22.509 --> 17:24.511
- I would have asked
the same thing.

17:24.511 --> 17:27.880
- I um, there's some cool stuff

17:27.880 --> 17:29.782
that happened at work today,

17:29.782 --> 17:30.917
you know what, forget it.

17:30.917 --> 17:31.984
I'll tell you after dinner.

17:31.984 --> 17:33.320
- No, wait, what happened?

17:33.320 --> 17:35.788
- I will tell you after dinner.

17:35.788 --> 17:37.357
- You have to tell me now.

17:37.357 --> 17:38.625
- I'll tell you later,

17:38.625 --> 17:39.426
'cause I don't know
what I'm gonna eat,

17:39.426 --> 17:40.293
I'll tell you later.

17:43.330 --> 17:44.164
- Tell me now.

17:45.265 --> 17:46.399
- Okay, they can hear you.

17:46.399 --> 17:49.536
- I don't care.
- Calm down.

17:49.536 --> 17:50.937
- Tell me, tell me.

17:50.937 --> 17:54.141
- So my boss Joe, he told me

17:54.141 --> 17:55.942
I have a title fight comin' up.

17:55.942 --> 17:58.111
- Really, what does that mean?

18:01.348 --> 18:02.782
- Your second water, sir.

18:02.782 --> 18:03.950
- Thank you so much.

18:03.950 --> 18:05.185
- Are we ready to order?

18:05.185 --> 18:06.619
- Um, I'm gonna do
the chicken Parmesan

18:06.619 --> 18:07.854
with the soup, please.

18:07.854 --> 18:08.688
- Very nice.
- Thank you.

18:08.688 --> 18:09.922
- And for you, sir?

18:09.922 --> 18:11.724
- I'm gonna have
the spinach salad.

18:11.724 --> 18:13.293
- And for your entree?

18:13.293 --> 18:14.461
- That is my entree.

18:18.531 --> 18:19.366
- Of course.

18:21.601 --> 18:22.569
- He hates you.

18:22.569 --> 18:24.003
- I know, did you see face?

18:24.003 --> 18:25.405
- I hate you too.

18:28.175 --> 18:29.842
He's in training for a
fight right now, though,

18:29.842 --> 18:32.479
so he doesn't eat
anything but spinach

18:32.479 --> 18:34.881
and I was just eating a lot,

18:34.881 --> 18:36.183
which was kind of awkward.

18:37.317 --> 18:39.486
- You guys are too cute,
it's so disgusting.

18:39.486 --> 18:40.320
- Stop it.

18:41.788 --> 18:42.789
- No, you guys are.

18:44.991 --> 18:46.326
- Why do you hate
everyone I date?

18:46.326 --> 18:47.894
He's awesome.

18:47.894 --> 18:51.264
- Well, to be fair, all
you dated were psychos.

18:52.432 --> 18:55.335
- Yeah, I know, but
this one's different.

18:55.335 --> 18:57.704
Definitely no psycho here.

18:57.704 --> 18:58.871
- Doesn't seem like it.

19:00.106 --> 19:01.541
- I don't know, it's just easy.

19:01.541 --> 19:03.810
We hit it off really well

19:03.810 --> 19:06.179
and we have a lot
of fun together.

19:07.680 --> 19:08.815
It's not forced.

19:09.782 --> 19:10.617
- Okay.

19:29.101 --> 19:31.904
- Nope.

19:31.904 --> 19:34.307
Nope.

19:34.307 --> 19:35.742
Nope.

19:35.742 --> 19:36.976
Can't have that.

19:36.976 --> 19:38.478
Nope.

19:38.478 --> 19:40.847
Oh, this is good, man,

19:40.847 --> 19:43.916
the best pasta you'll ever
have in your life, bro.

19:43.916 --> 19:45.618
I mean, this is excellent,

19:47.220 --> 19:48.421
but you can't have that.

19:50.757 --> 19:52.792
- Do we really have to
go through this, man?

19:52.792 --> 19:55.328
I know how to cut weight,
I've done it before.

19:55.328 --> 19:57.764
- Yeah, I know, man,
but this is different.

19:57.764 --> 19:59.499
You have to lose more weight

19:59.499 --> 20:00.500
and replace it with muscle.

20:00.500 --> 20:01.868
I'm talkin' about protein.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.437
You know I was just
jokin' when I said

20:04.437 --> 20:06.606
he was gonna whip
your ass, right?

20:06.606 --> 20:08.941
Dude, if you don't follow this

20:08.941 --> 20:11.644
he's going to whoop your ass.

20:12.812 --> 20:14.314
I mean, he's faster than you,

20:14.314 --> 20:15.882
he's stronger than you,

20:15.882 --> 20:18.751
he's cruel, and he's loco.

20:18.751 --> 20:19.852
The only way you're
gonna beat this dude

20:19.852 --> 20:20.820
is with pure power.

20:22.789 --> 20:25.925
- But I mean, is box lunches
really the way to go?

20:25.925 --> 20:28.761
I like home cooked meals,
you know what I mean?

20:28.761 --> 20:31.130
- I mean, you don't have
time to cook for yourself.

20:31.130 --> 20:33.900
We gotta train, and
your ex isn't here

20:33.900 --> 20:35.735
to do it for you like last time.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.937
- Yeah, but I mean, I got a,

20:37.937 --> 20:39.872
I got a new
girlfriend, you know?

20:39.872 --> 20:42.842
She could probably cook
for me, I don't know.

20:44.210 --> 20:45.111
- She got a friend?

20:46.346 --> 20:49.081
- No, she does not
have any friends.

20:50.850 --> 20:51.951
- Can't have that,

20:51.951 --> 20:53.420
can't have this.

21:03.430 --> 21:05.332
- So you've never been
to a fight gym before?

21:05.332 --> 21:06.599
- Nope.
- Nah, okay.

21:06.599 --> 21:07.800
This is usually where I teach,

21:07.800 --> 21:09.101
like kids and level one
and stuff like that.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.471
- Awww.
- this is where I train.

21:11.471 --> 21:12.839
That's where I
train, like sparring,

21:12.839 --> 21:14.307
like me and my coach,

21:14.307 --> 21:16.409
this is where they do jiu jitsu

21:16.409 --> 21:18.945
- Okay.
- This is coach Mauricio.

21:18.945 --> 21:20.212
- Hi Ricky.
- Hey.

21:20.212 --> 21:21.348
- How are you doin'?
- This is Danielle.

21:21.348 --> 21:22.582
- Hi.
- Danielle, nice to meet you.

21:22.582 --> 21:23.516
- Nice to meet you too.

21:23.516 --> 21:24.584
- So I'm just givin' her a tour,

21:24.584 --> 21:26.118
we were gonna go train, but,

21:26.118 --> 21:27.820
I don't know if you
wanna train jiu jitsu,

21:27.820 --> 21:28.755
'cause they're doin' it already.

21:28.755 --> 21:29.689
- Try it, you're gonna like it.

21:29.689 --> 21:30.990
- Do I get to wear the coat?

21:30.990 --> 21:31.924
- Yeah.

21:31.924 --> 21:33.693
- Right on.
- Great.

21:33.693 --> 21:35.161
- I got some stuff over here.

21:36.896 --> 21:38.698
- You wanna control his gi,

21:38.698 --> 21:40.533
pressure him on the ground,

21:40.533 --> 21:43.436
stand up your leg,
push his knee down.

21:45.204 --> 21:49.542
Slide over his knee,
control his head.

21:50.677 --> 21:53.513
You wanna put pressure,
your shoulder,

21:53.513 --> 21:55.648
pressure over his
face, really tight.

22:02.689 --> 22:03.590
Nice.

22:21.207 --> 22:22.509
- How is he doin' anyway?

22:22.509 --> 22:23.510
- Yo.
- Oh, sup Ricky.

22:23.510 --> 22:24.644
- Hi brother.
- How are you?

22:24.644 --> 22:25.912
Good?
- Good, man, good to see you.

22:25.912 --> 22:26.846
- How's everything?

22:26.846 --> 22:28.781
- Everything is delicious, bro.

22:28.781 --> 22:29.782
So, how did she do in there?

22:29.782 --> 22:31.551
- Good, man, no trouble.

22:31.551 --> 22:33.886
Doing good, talented,
easy learner.

22:34.854 --> 22:36.456
No trouble.
- No trouble.

22:36.456 --> 22:39.291
It's fun when there's no trouble.
Little problem's fun too.

22:39.291 --> 22:40.493
- Coffee?
- Wanna try?

22:40.493 --> 22:41.327
- Can I?

22:41.327 --> 22:42.161
- Yeah, go ahead.

22:45.398 --> 22:47.033
Let me know what you think.

22:47.033 --> 22:47.867
- Pumpkin stuff?

22:50.236 --> 22:52.338
- Hey, don't judge,
man, don't judge.

22:52.338 --> 22:53.473
- Take care, brother,
have a good one.

22:53.473 --> 22:54.807
- It's the sweet
stuff, you know?

22:54.807 --> 22:55.775
- That's good, that's good.

22:55.775 --> 22:58.177
- All right, this fucking guy.

23:04.784 --> 23:06.252
- Hey Joe, man, look at 'em.

23:06.252 --> 23:08.087
Ricky in love, man.

23:08.087 --> 23:09.288
- You know Ricky, I have to say,

23:09.288 --> 23:10.890
I really like this decision

23:10.890 --> 23:13.125
to have your girlfriend
fight for you,

23:13.125 --> 23:14.326
you know because I think she has

23:14.326 --> 23:15.928
much better footwork
and much better defense

23:15.928 --> 23:17.597
than you'll ever have.

23:17.597 --> 23:19.499
- Oh, Ricky, that's adorable.

23:21.801 --> 23:23.936
- So who's teaching who here?

23:23.936 --> 23:25.071
- Hey guys, how you doin'?

23:25.071 --> 23:26.272
- Hey mama.
- Hey, what up mama?

23:26.272 --> 23:27.707
- Doin' good.
- What brings you here?

23:27.707 --> 23:29.408
- I just brought
Ricky some lunch.

23:29.408 --> 23:31.544
- Oh, really, you
think he needs it?

23:31.544 --> 23:33.580
- I do, he's working hard,

23:33.580 --> 23:35.515
but I got you guys some too.

23:35.515 --> 23:36.315
- Okay, thank you.

23:36.315 --> 23:37.517
- You're welcome.

23:37.517 --> 23:39.552
- You spoiled, man.

23:39.552 --> 23:40.853
- Don't be spoilin'
him now, mama.

23:40.853 --> 23:42.622
- [Ricky] I was born spoiled.
- That's right.

23:42.622 --> 23:44.891
- Well yeah, you
kind of look it.

23:44.891 --> 23:46.158
- [Ricky] Thanks mom.
- Okay you guys,

23:46.158 --> 23:48.060
you're welcome sweetie,
I'll see you later,

23:48.060 --> 23:49.596
okay, don't forget
to call your father.

23:49.596 --> 23:50.429
- I won't.

23:50.429 --> 23:51.397
- Okay, bye mi hijo.

23:51.397 --> 23:52.331
Bye guys.
- Bye mama.

23:52.331 --> 23:54.634
- All right, bye mama.

23:54.634 --> 23:57.136
- Oh, mijo, I love you so much.

23:58.805 --> 24:00.540
- Come on, now,
work for your lunch.

24:03.576 --> 24:05.778
Oh, hey Tony.
- Hey.

24:05.778 --> 24:06.613
- How you doin'?

24:06.613 --> 24:07.446
- Good to see you.

24:07.446 --> 24:08.280
- Yeah, you too.

24:09.181 --> 24:11.951
- So, this what you been doin'?

24:11.951 --> 24:14.654
I thought you were here
trainin' for your big fight.

24:14.654 --> 24:17.857
- You're lookin' a
little bit out of shape.

24:17.857 --> 24:20.326
- You wish, you
look out of shape.

24:20.326 --> 24:22.361
You need to come train with
me and see what happens.

24:22.361 --> 24:24.063
- Lemme, lemme get
your paperwork.

24:26.866 --> 24:28.000
- Hey Tony.
- Yeah.

24:29.168 --> 24:30.670
- When can I come
fight for you, man?

24:31.571 --> 24:33.072
- When you learn how to fight.

24:34.073 --> 24:35.141
- That's cold, Tony.

24:35.141 --> 24:35.975
- A little bit.

24:35.975 --> 24:37.644
- That's cold, man.

24:37.644 --> 24:40.847
- Here you go, signed,
sealed, delivered.

24:40.847 --> 24:41.948
- Great.

24:41.948 --> 24:42.882
- We really
appreciate everything

24:42.882 --> 24:43.349
you do for us here, Tony.

24:44.784 --> 24:46.653
- Well I really appreciate
what you do for my company.

24:48.755 --> 24:50.122
Don't forget you're
wearing my logo now,

24:50.122 --> 24:51.357
don't embarrass me.

24:51.357 --> 24:53.159
- Hey, don't embarrass
this man, you hear that?

24:53.159 --> 24:54.360
- I wanted to thank
you for taking care

24:54.360 --> 24:56.428
of my medicals, I
really appreciate it.

24:56.428 --> 24:57.830
- That's what I'm here for.

24:57.830 --> 24:59.966
- Thank you.
- You're a good fighter.

24:59.966 --> 25:02.201
Proud to have you
a part of my show.

25:02.201 --> 25:03.803
- All right, good fighter?

25:03.803 --> 25:05.337
- I'll walk you out.
- Good fighter.

25:05.337 --> 25:07.006
- Hey, get back to work.

25:08.207 --> 25:09.776
- Yeah, go continue to be cute.

25:11.878 --> 25:14.013
You guys are disgusting.

25:14.013 --> 25:15.047
- Did you have a
good time today?

25:15.047 --> 25:15.982
- I did.

25:15.982 --> 25:18.050
- Yeah, how'd you like training?

25:18.050 --> 25:20.720
- It was fun, I don't think
I'm a fighter, though.

25:21.954 --> 25:23.756
- I wasn't gonna
say anything, but--

25:24.891 --> 25:26.859
- I don't think you're
a teacher either.

25:26.859 --> 25:28.561
- Mauricio's a lot
better than me.

25:35.735 --> 25:37.469
You waiting for
me to make a move?

25:37.469 --> 25:42.474
- Well yeah, that's
your job, I don't do it.

25:43.209 --> 25:45.978
(romantic music)

27:04.456 --> 27:09.461
- 44, 45, 46, 47,
48, 49. 50, good job.

27:14.667 --> 27:18.905
Good job, good job, you
ready for the next one?

27:18.905 --> 27:20.572
- What?

27:20.572 --> 27:21.841
- Just messin' with you.

27:22.942 --> 27:24.977
- Oh my god.
- Good job, man.

27:24.977 --> 27:27.146
- So how's that lady
friend of yours doin'?

27:27.146 --> 27:28.781
- Oh, the one I was
tellin' you about?

27:28.781 --> 27:31.583
She's good, man,
yeah, she's amazing.

27:31.583 --> 27:33.419
Like--
- Amazing.

27:33.419 --> 27:37.489
- She's smart, she's funny,
she's, it's pretty serious.

27:37.489 --> 27:38.958
- Seriously?
- Yeah, yeah.

27:40.092 --> 27:42.494
- Take my advice,
man, enjoy your youth.

27:42.494 --> 27:44.630
- My youth, I'm not that young.

27:44.630 --> 27:47.633
For a fighter, I'm
not that young.

27:47.633 --> 27:50.202
All right, you can gimme
that, you can gimme that.

27:50.202 --> 27:53.639
- Yeah, well for women,
you're way too young.

27:53.639 --> 27:56.142
Look, trust me, by the
time I was your age

27:56.142 --> 28:01.080
I had divorced already twice.

28:02.281 --> 28:03.515
- Yeah, but you were
married to two women

28:03.515 --> 28:04.650
at the same time,
that doesn't count.

28:04.650 --> 28:05.484
Okay, you didn't know they were

28:05.484 --> 28:06.753
gonna run away together.

28:06.753 --> 28:08.855
- You never know when
a woman's gonna leave,

28:08.855 --> 28:10.089
or what the hell
they're gonna do.

28:10.089 --> 28:11.958
That's my point, smartass.

28:13.159 --> 28:14.994
- I'm just saying,
you know this one,

28:14.994 --> 28:17.529
she feels different, you know.

28:17.529 --> 28:20.332
I'm happy, I'm feelin' positive,

28:20.332 --> 28:22.601
and that's all it
is, that's all it is.

28:22.601 --> 28:25.437
- Well, okay.
- Okay.

28:25.437 --> 28:27.673
- You want me to hit this again?

28:27.673 --> 28:29.541
- We're gonna move
on to somethin' else,

28:29.541 --> 28:32.611
just take a couple, man,
you're sweatin' pretty hard.

28:33.712 --> 28:36.082
How'd you like livin'
in Utah anyway?

28:37.416 --> 28:39.585
- The weather was--
- Crap?

28:39.585 --> 28:40.419
- Crap.

28:41.788 --> 28:43.689
- It was just ridiculous,

28:43.689 --> 28:45.992
like my professor
actually thought

28:45.992 --> 28:49.595
that I was going to be okay
with a B on my term paper.

28:49.595 --> 28:51.898
You see, I just knew
that he was jealous

28:51.898 --> 28:54.400
that my father makes
more money in one year

28:54.400 --> 28:57.469
than he has ever,
in his entire life,

28:57.469 --> 28:58.437
and I told him that too,

28:58.437 --> 28:59.371
just straight to his face.

28:59.371 --> 29:01.307
- That's so incredible, Cameron.

29:02.775 --> 29:03.642
I love you, babe.

29:05.244 --> 29:06.378
- The professors at our school

29:06.378 --> 29:08.614
forget that we pay to go there.

29:08.614 --> 29:10.082
- Do you go to school, Hector?

29:10.082 --> 29:10.950
- It's Ricky.

29:12.251 --> 29:15.587
- I don't, no, I'm not
the brainy one here.

29:15.587 --> 29:19.158
- Right, you do
that fighting thing.

29:20.259 --> 29:22.161
- Yes, yes I do.

29:22.161 --> 29:23.295
- MMA is it?

29:23.295 --> 29:25.731
- Muay Thai.
- Pardon?

29:25.731 --> 29:30.236
- Muay Thai, Muay Thai,
it's Thai kickboxing.

29:30.236 --> 29:32.771
- Oh, I thought
you said Mai Tai,

29:32.771 --> 29:34.974
I was gonna be like
I could totally

29:34.974 --> 29:37.109
go for one of those
drinks right now.

29:37.109 --> 29:38.044
- You must make a lot of money

29:38.044 --> 29:41.013
in this Muay Thai business.

29:43.816 --> 29:46.618
- Not compared to
boxing, MMA, but--

29:46.618 --> 29:47.753
- I don't understand, then.

29:47.753 --> 29:49.521
Why don't you do
something more lucrative

29:49.521 --> 29:52.791
like MMA or like boxing?

29:54.193 --> 29:56.328
- Maybe he's just
not good enough.

29:56.328 --> 29:57.596
- No, I mean I'm good enough.

29:57.596 --> 30:00.933
I just don't wanna
do MMA or boxing.

30:00.933 --> 30:02.902
I like Muay Thai,
I grew up with it.

30:02.902 --> 30:06.405
That's my martial
art, and I love it.

30:06.405 --> 30:08.875
I mean, you guys
love the law, right?

30:08.875 --> 30:11.210
That's why you do it,
that's why you're in school?

30:11.210 --> 30:12.411
- Are you kidding me?

30:12.411 --> 30:13.846
I do it because of the money.

30:14.981 --> 30:17.749
- That's how, you guys
all feel that way?

30:17.749 --> 30:18.584
- Pretty much.

30:22.454 --> 30:25.291
- I guess I just can't explain
then why I love Muay Thai.

30:26.492 --> 30:28.760
You should come down to the gym.

30:28.760 --> 30:30.562
I'll give you a lesson.

30:30.562 --> 30:31.730
- I'm good, thank you.

30:32.698 --> 30:34.300
- I'll take a raincheck on that.

30:35.434 --> 30:36.768
- Maybe he's scared.

30:36.768 --> 30:37.970
- Maybe he's a dick.

30:43.709 --> 30:47.213
- I cannot believe the
way Priscilla was acting.

30:47.213 --> 30:48.680
- Yeah, it wasn't
really her, though,

30:48.680 --> 30:49.648
it was that one guy.

30:53.219 --> 30:55.654
- Sorry about that,
I'm really embarrassed,

30:55.654 --> 30:57.623
and thank you for
putting up with that.

30:57.623 --> 30:59.025
You handled it really well.

31:00.459 --> 31:01.560
- I'm gonna beat him up.

31:01.560 --> 31:03.662
- You're gonna beat him up?

31:03.662 --> 31:05.664
- Nah, I'm just gonna,

31:05.664 --> 31:07.666
your friends, they
don't socialize

31:07.666 --> 31:10.469
outside their circle
too much, do they?

31:10.469 --> 31:13.305
- I don't know, but
they're not racist

31:13.305 --> 31:16.008
or anything, I swear,
that's not what it is.

31:16.008 --> 31:17.809
- No, not racist, just snobbish.

31:17.809 --> 31:19.245
- Snobbish?

31:19.245 --> 31:21.080
- Yeah, snobs.

31:21.080 --> 31:23.149
- Well, lawyers.

31:24.783 --> 31:26.218
- All right, good
job today class.

31:26.218 --> 31:28.854
Couple announcements,
the jiu jitsu team,

31:28.854 --> 31:30.756
they won three out of
five matches this weekend,

31:30.756 --> 31:33.926
so go ahead and give it up
to them, all right, good job.

31:35.261 --> 31:36.762
You know how hard
it is over there.

31:36.762 --> 31:40.967
Um, other announcements, I
do have my fight comin' up.

31:40.967 --> 31:43.402
Title match, it's
pretty cool, um,

31:43.402 --> 31:45.204
if you can, come on down.

31:45.204 --> 31:46.705
We're selling
tickets at the front.

31:46.705 --> 31:48.674
Buy 'em here, it does help me.

31:48.674 --> 31:51.677
Other than that, that's it,
hope to see you guys again,

31:51.677 --> 31:53.679
thank you for
coming to my class.

31:53.679 --> 31:56.949
Shake hands with your
partners and we're good.

31:59.551 --> 32:00.552
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

32:00.552 --> 32:01.920
- Thank you.

32:01.920 --> 32:02.921
Thank you.
- Good luck on your match man.

32:02.921 --> 32:04.023
- All right thank you.

32:12.298 --> 32:13.132
How was it?

32:14.533 --> 32:19.038
- Man, hey, congratulations,
dude, on gettin' a title fight.

32:19.771 --> 32:21.007
- Yeah, it's all right.

32:21.007 --> 32:23.509
- Hey, don't be so
modest about it.

32:23.509 --> 32:27.113
- I just, I have a lot of
training to do, you know,

32:27.113 --> 32:29.048
and I gotta lot
of weight to cut,

32:29.048 --> 32:31.017
and that's just,
I mean I'm hopin'

32:31.017 --> 32:33.119
I can do it, I don't know.

32:33.119 --> 32:34.353
I'm hopin', I'm hopin'.

32:34.353 --> 32:36.088
- Yeah, well
congratulations, though, man.

32:36.088 --> 32:37.489
- Thank you, I appreciate it,

32:37.489 --> 32:38.490
I really appreciate that,

32:38.490 --> 32:39.558
I mean you're gonna come, right?

32:39.558 --> 32:41.027
Did you get your ticket?

32:41.027 --> 32:43.095
- Yeah, yeah, well you
know, I gotta work, right?

32:43.095 --> 32:44.630
- Yeah.
- but I'm gonna

32:44.630 --> 32:46.598
try my damnedest
to get down here.

32:46.598 --> 32:49.135
- That's all I ask, man,
just give it a shot.

32:49.135 --> 32:51.237
- I believe in you, Rick.

32:51.237 --> 32:52.871
I believe in you.

32:52.871 --> 32:55.907
Hey, so what about
tomorrow evening, huh?

32:55.907 --> 32:58.677
- Tomorrow, what time do
you get off, three or four?

32:58.677 --> 32:59.645
- Well,
- same time?

32:59.645 --> 33:02.514
- Maybe between four and five?

33:02.514 --> 33:03.982
- Yeah, that's fine.
- Six?

33:03.982 --> 33:06.018
- Six, you're pushin' it.

33:06.018 --> 33:07.986
- Six, I'll see you
at 6:30, all right?

33:09.388 --> 33:10.356
Gimme some love.

33:10.356 --> 33:11.857
- All right, 6:00.

33:21.300 --> 33:22.201
(knocking on door)

33:22.201 --> 33:23.202
- It's open.

33:29.541 --> 33:31.210
- Hey hi, I'm Rick.

33:31.210 --> 33:33.979
- Hi, I'm Kathy,
Danielle's mother.

33:33.979 --> 33:36.215
- Hi, I'm Rick,
Danielle's boyfriend.

33:38.350 --> 33:41.453
- She's been waiting at the
window for like 20 minutes.

33:41.453 --> 33:44.456
- We saw you pull up, but
you weren't coming in.

33:44.456 --> 33:46.258
- I was getting
changed in the car.

33:46.258 --> 33:49.528
I didn't wanna come in
smelling like the gym.

33:49.528 --> 33:52.098
- Well uh, we're gonna go
on a walk before dinner.

33:52.098 --> 33:53.665
- Oh, it's so nice
to meet you, Rick,

33:53.665 --> 33:55.033
and I want you guys to have fun

33:55.033 --> 33:56.335
and I'll see you
when you get back.

33:56.335 --> 33:58.137
- Okay.
- All right?

33:58.137 --> 33:58.937
- Bye.

34:01.773 --> 34:04.976
- So how's your relationship
with your parents again?

34:04.976 --> 34:06.612
- It's fine, why?

34:06.612 --> 34:08.447
- I was just asking.

34:08.447 --> 34:09.848
- Are you judging me?

34:09.848 --> 34:11.150
- I'm always judging you.

34:12.184 --> 34:13.885
- You can go home.

34:13.885 --> 34:16.088
- And then when do
you start school?

34:16.088 --> 34:17.856
- I start on Tuesday.
- You start on Tuesday?

34:17.856 --> 34:19.324
- Mm-hmm.

34:19.324 --> 34:20.992
- Okay, and it's like
Tuesday Thursday classes,

34:20.992 --> 34:23.429
Monday Tuesday, just Tuesdays?

34:23.429 --> 34:25.197
- Monday through Friday.

34:25.197 --> 34:26.864
- That's a lot of school.

34:26.864 --> 34:29.168
Are you gonna be goin' to work
too or are you gonna quit?

34:29.168 --> 34:32.304
- I'm not gonna quit,
I'm gonna do it all.

34:32.304 --> 34:34.039
- Are you still gonna
be able to hang out?

34:34.039 --> 34:38.110
- With you?
- Yeah.

34:38.110 --> 34:39.578
- I guess so.

34:39.578 --> 34:42.248
- Can you, can you do a push up?

34:42.248 --> 34:44.315
I mean, or do you just
sort of fall to the ground

34:44.315 --> 34:45.717
and hope somebody
else'll pick you up?

34:45.717 --> 34:47.453
'Cause I, I'm not judging.

34:48.387 --> 34:49.321
Not judging.

34:49.321 --> 34:50.789
- That's my husband for you.

34:50.789 --> 34:52.891
We're pretty easy
to get along with

34:52.891 --> 34:53.824
once you get to know us.

34:53.824 --> 34:55.092
- I can definitely see where

34:55.092 --> 34:56.862
Danielle gets her
personality from.

34:56.862 --> 34:58.664
- Well, I'm glad to hear that.

34:58.664 --> 34:59.565
She's a pretty good kid.

34:59.565 --> 35:00.799
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm all right.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.602
- Are you sure you're
okay with a salad?

35:03.602 --> 35:05.371
I'm really sorry,
I wish I could have

35:05.371 --> 35:06.638
cooked more for you.

35:06.638 --> 35:08.073
- He's all right mom,
don't worry about it.

35:08.073 --> 35:09.508
- But he's so thin, he
needs to put some weight on.

35:09.508 --> 35:11.477
- Or not, I mean
you can continue

35:11.477 --> 35:12.678
to eat something that looks like

35:12.678 --> 35:15.113
a raccoon left it
behind in a bird feeder.

35:15.113 --> 35:16.682
The choice is yours.

35:16.682 --> 35:18.784
- Well, my husband
used to be a fighter.

35:18.784 --> 35:20.486
- Is that so, what
kind of fighting?

35:20.486 --> 35:22.988
- Uh, humans,
humans, not fighting

35:22.988 --> 35:25.491
the discount bargain
rack it seems like

35:25.491 --> 35:26.992
your shirt came off of.

35:26.992 --> 35:28.594
It's okay, Ricky, I mean,

35:28.594 --> 35:30.128
you can't win
every fight, right,

35:30.128 --> 35:32.264
or maybe any of 'em.

35:32.264 --> 35:34.333
- [Danielle] Dad.

35:34.333 --> 35:36.735
- Cortez, Cortez was
the best fighter,

35:36.735 --> 35:38.437
you gotta be kidding me, man.

35:38.437 --> 35:39.538
Right, Robinson?

35:40.772 --> 35:42.140
He didn't train for the fight.

35:42.140 --> 35:44.476
- Excuses, excuses--
- excuses two months.

35:44.476 --> 35:46.612
- All excuses man.
- Two months?

35:46.612 --> 35:48.447
Two months to get
ready for a fight?

35:48.447 --> 35:49.848
For a championship fight?

35:49.848 --> 35:50.682
You're outta your mind.

35:50.682 --> 35:51.617
- Hey, that's his fault.

35:51.617 --> 35:52.618
- Puchie, Puchie, tell 'em, bro.

35:52.618 --> 35:55.554
- Listen, listen, regardless.

35:55.554 --> 35:57.022
This guy could have
had three months,

35:57.022 --> 36:00.526
six months, hell, a year,
this guy doesn't compare, man.

36:00.526 --> 36:03.529
listen, Gold Tooth Robinson's
the best there was, period.

36:03.529 --> 36:04.763
- I'm gonna tell you
about Gold Tooth.

36:04.763 --> 36:08.133
Gold Tooth was a dancer,
he danced, all right?

36:08.133 --> 36:12.070
Cortez stood in front, he boxed
toe to toe, he didn't move.

36:12.070 --> 36:13.472
Mijo, am I right, am I right?

36:13.472 --> 36:16.875
- You just said the
key word, boxed, k box.

36:16.875 --> 36:18.710
That's how you fight,
that's how you win.

36:18.710 --> 36:20.779
You stick and move,
it's whoever can hit

36:20.779 --> 36:22.614
and not get hit, bro,
it's who's smarter.

36:22.614 --> 36:23.615
That's how boxing is won.

36:23.615 --> 36:24.883
- No man that's called dancing.

36:24.883 --> 36:26.051
- It's called boxing.
- It's called dancing.

36:26.051 --> 36:28.287
The best fighter, pound
for pound, Cortez,

36:28.287 --> 36:29.555
am I right mijo?

36:29.555 --> 36:31.022
- I don't know who Cortez is.

36:31.022 --> 36:32.291
- Man, this guy
doesn't watch boxing,

36:32.291 --> 36:33.692
all he watches is Muay Thai.

36:35.093 --> 36:38.029
- Muay Thai, eh, that
stuff was before my time.

36:38.029 --> 36:42.301
I mean, that was over in
China when I was a youngster.

36:42.301 --> 36:43.835
- Thailand, pop.

36:43.835 --> 36:46.338
- Thailand, China, Japan,
bro, it's all over there.

36:47.573 --> 36:48.440
- What's your name again?

36:48.440 --> 36:49.675
- Danielle.

36:49.675 --> 36:51.310
- Danielle, that's
a boy's name, right?

36:52.511 --> 36:53.979
- [Man] Oh come on
pop, come on man.

36:53.979 --> 36:56.282
- Come on, you know
that was funny.

36:56.282 --> 36:57.449
- [Man] Don't let him
talk to you that way.

36:57.449 --> 36:59.385
Don't let him bully
you like that.

36:59.385 --> 37:02.053
- No, all kidding aside,
you know this family,

37:02.053 --> 37:06.425
we come from a long line
of warriors, that's right.

37:06.425 --> 37:09.528
I know you can't tell, but
Puchie used to be in shape.

37:12.298 --> 37:13.231
- It's all the beers.

37:13.231 --> 37:15.667
- Yeah, after he got hurt.

37:17.636 --> 37:19.605
You know, though
this family you can

37:19.605 --> 37:22.207
trace us all the way
back to the Aztecs.

37:22.207 --> 37:23.442
I'm serious.

37:23.442 --> 37:24.976
- Hey, tell 'em
about the Aztecs.

37:24.976 --> 37:26.177
- His great, great uncle,
no this is a true story--

37:26.177 --> 37:27.613
- Tell them, tell
'em about the Aztecs.

37:27.613 --> 37:32.150
- Anyways, what was
it, like 400 years ago,

37:32.150 --> 37:35.954
400 years ago our
great, great grandfather

37:35.954 --> 37:39.224
used to fight in these fights.

37:39.224 --> 37:40.692
- The Muay Thai fights?

37:40.692 --> 37:42.594
- Muay Thai fights, you
know what I'm talkin' about.

37:42.594 --> 37:44.095
- I'm being led away.

37:44.095 --> 37:46.665
- Yeah, my cousin Puchie,
he was a great fighter,

37:46.665 --> 37:47.933
- Hi guys,
- really in shape and stuff.

37:47.933 --> 37:49.801
- Here Danielle.
- Oh, thanks.

37:49.801 --> 37:50.702
- You're welcome.

37:54.105 --> 37:55.307
- Here you go.
- I can't,

37:55.307 --> 37:57.175
I can't eat most of this.

37:57.175 --> 37:58.109
- Why not?

37:58.109 --> 38:00.612
- It's starches and it's carbs.

38:00.612 --> 38:02.548
- One meal is not
gonna hurt you.

38:02.548 --> 38:04.983
- I'm in fight camp, one
meal is going to hurt me.

38:04.983 --> 38:07.753
- No it's not, look
how skinny you are.

38:07.753 --> 38:09.521
You both look anorexic to me.

38:09.521 --> 38:11.222
- Let's not talk
about it in front of--

38:11.222 --> 38:13.492
- You do, though,
honey you have to eat.

38:13.492 --> 38:14.726
- No.
- You do.

38:14.726 --> 38:16.261
Women like guys with
a little meat on 'em.

38:16.261 --> 38:17.429
Will you tell him, Danielle?

38:17.429 --> 38:19.798
- It's true, it makes
us look smaller.

38:19.798 --> 38:21.567
- Don't agree with
her, you're supposed

38:21.567 --> 38:22.768
to be agreeing with me.

38:22.768 --> 38:23.569
- No, I have to
agree with your mom.

38:23.569 --> 38:24.670
- Mijo, it's true.

38:24.670 --> 38:26.237
- You know what, here.

38:26.237 --> 38:27.739
- What?

38:27.739 --> 38:30.241
- You can have that, we're
both gonna go inside.

38:30.241 --> 38:31.176
- I'm staying with your mom.

38:31.176 --> 38:31.977
- Okay, she can stay with me.

38:31.977 --> 38:33.311
You can go inside.

38:33.311 --> 38:34.846
- We're gonna have
a girl talk now.

38:34.846 --> 38:36.081
- You know what?

38:36.081 --> 38:37.449
One day I'm gonna
gain like 200 pounds

38:37.449 --> 38:40.251
and you're both gonna
have to deal with that.

38:44.490 --> 38:47.426
- That's cute, look
at your cheeks.

38:50.862 --> 38:52.998
So, which one's this
mysterious brother

38:52.998 --> 38:54.566
your mom was telling me about?

38:55.767 --> 38:57.403
- What did she tell you?

38:57.403 --> 38:59.505
- That you have a brother
that you don't talk about,

38:59.505 --> 39:01.507
that you have not told me about.

39:01.507 --> 39:03.609
- It's 'cause he lives
in L.A., it's far,

39:03.609 --> 39:04.543
what's the point?

39:04.543 --> 39:05.744
- It's still in California.

39:05.744 --> 39:07.245
- When was the last
time you talked to him?

39:07.245 --> 39:09.114
- A few days ago.

39:10.015 --> 39:11.550
- A few days ago?

39:11.550 --> 39:12.884
- Yeah, I mean he calls, but
we don't talk about nothin'.

39:12.884 --> 39:13.852
- You don't talk about nothin'?

39:13.852 --> 39:15.587
What does that even mean?

39:15.587 --> 39:20.025
- He calls me, he asks about
my car, that's about it.

39:20.025 --> 39:21.226
- Yeah?

39:21.226 --> 39:22.461
What do you tell
him about your car?

39:22.461 --> 39:27.198
That you should drive
it to L.A. to go see him

39:27.198 --> 39:28.467
and invite him to your fight?

39:28.467 --> 39:29.901
Is he coming to your fight?

39:29.901 --> 39:31.937
- I don't even know if
he's coming to my fight.

39:31.937 --> 39:33.705
I don't even know if
he knows about it.

39:33.705 --> 39:35.306
- You should find
out about that.

39:35.306 --> 39:36.642
He should be at your fight.

39:38.577 --> 39:41.413
- Mom, mom.

39:41.413 --> 39:42.648
- [Mama] What?

39:42.648 --> 39:43.849
- Does Bennie know
about my fight?

39:43.849 --> 39:46.051
- [Mama] I don't know,
did you tell him?

39:46.051 --> 39:48.053
- He doesn't know about
my fight, just let it go.

39:48.053 --> 39:49.488
- No, let's call
him, get your phone.

39:49.488 --> 39:51.222
Where is your phone,
let's call him right now.

39:51.222 --> 39:54.259
- [Mama] Call him, it's
up to you, you know.

39:54.259 --> 39:55.093
- Mama knows.

39:56.394 --> 40:01.066
- Oh my gosh, you broke her.

40:01.066 --> 40:02.634
- [Mama] Call him, go see him.

40:02.634 --> 40:04.536
- She's just bringin'
the real me out.

40:07.205 --> 40:09.307
Let's go see him, I'll drive.

40:09.307 --> 40:11.943
We can get snacks,
or I can get snacks.

40:38.203 --> 40:40.539
So what time are we supposed
to meet your brother?

40:40.539 --> 40:41.573
- Six.

40:42.508 --> 40:43.975
- What are you guys gonna do?

40:43.975 --> 40:47.913
- Eat, maybe.
- Eat, chill, bond.

40:47.913 --> 40:49.748
Bro talk.
- Bro talk.

40:49.748 --> 40:52.150
- Yeah, what do you
guys talk about?

40:52.150 --> 40:53.752
- We don't talk
about a single thing.

40:53.752 --> 40:55.453
- You don't talk at all?

40:55.453 --> 40:57.455
- No, we have nothin' in common.

40:57.455 --> 41:00.125
- I'm sure, the weather,
everyone can find

41:00.125 --> 41:01.860
something to talk about.

41:01.860 --> 41:05.430
- We're just gonna sit
there, and that's it.

41:05.430 --> 41:06.932
We drive back.

41:06.932 --> 41:09.134
- Well, you better find
something in common.

41:10.502 --> 41:12.037
Tell him how great I am.

41:12.037 --> 41:13.071
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

41:14.272 --> 41:17.709
- I should tell him
that you even exist.

41:17.709 --> 41:20.746
- He doesn't know
about me, well.

41:20.746 --> 41:22.213
- What are you gonna do,
you gonna be there with us?

41:22.213 --> 41:24.015
- No, you should have your time,

41:24.015 --> 41:25.150
I'm gonna go see a
movie or something.

41:25.150 --> 41:27.418
- You sure?
- Yeah.

41:27.418 --> 41:28.954
- You ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

41:28.954 --> 41:30.522
- Let's go.

41:30.522 --> 41:31.356
- Put me down.

41:40.599 --> 41:42.734
- Hey, Ricky.
- Hey, Bennie.

41:43.769 --> 41:45.470

41:45.470 --> 41:47.739
- Five or 10 minutes ago.

41:47.739 --> 41:48.607

41:51.409 --> 41:53.712

41:55.714 --> 41:56.514
What's up?

41:57.448 --> 41:58.650
- How's that car running?

41:59.785 --> 42:01.519
- Good, it's good.

42:01.519 --> 42:03.288
- You change the oil

42:03.288 --> 42:04.089
- Yeah.

42:06.224 --> 42:07.092
You talk to mom?

42:26.377 --> 42:28.313

42:28.313 --> 42:29.781

I'm good, Bennie.

42:47.532 --> 42:48.600
- Here, just take it.

42:53.772 --> 42:56.274
You need some more, just
ask, don't worry about it.

42:56.274 --> 42:57.108
- Thanks, Bennie.

43:00.211 --> 43:02.313
- All right, I'm
gonna head back.

43:02.313 --> 43:05.316
- I'll put your plate,
I'll walk out with you.

43:05.316 --> 43:06.151
- All right.

43:34.345 --> 43:36.414
- I'm gonna be late,
I'm gonna be late.

43:36.414 --> 43:38.216
- You're not gonna be
late, you're gonna be fine.

43:38.216 --> 43:39.150
- I'm already late.

43:39.150 --> 43:40.618
- I was always late to school.

43:40.618 --> 43:42.053
- And look where you are now.

43:43.154 --> 43:45.023
I'm out at three, okay?
- At three, okay.

43:45.023 --> 43:46.725
Babe.
- Yeah?

43:46.725 --> 43:48.359
- I love you.
- I love you too.

43:48.359 --> 43:50.128
- Make some friends
today at school.

43:59.570 --> 44:01.239
- Hey Ricky, can I
talk to you a sec?

44:01.239 --> 44:02.373
- Yeah, what's up, Joe?

44:03.408 --> 44:04.475
- Are you comin' out?

44:13.451 --> 44:16.621
- What's goin' on,
what's goin' on, Joe?

44:18.623 --> 44:21.927
- One of the members came to
me with a rumor about Rudy.

44:21.927 --> 44:22.994
- Rumor about Rudy?

44:22.994 --> 44:23.929
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah?

44:23.929 --> 44:25.196
- Yeah, I checked it out.

44:27.498 --> 44:31.602
Thing is, he's been bettin'
on underground fights.

44:34.740 --> 44:37.242
Illegal fights in the city,

44:37.242 --> 44:40.912
he's been settin' 'em
up and bettin' on 'em.

44:45.316 --> 44:46.752
You involved in these fights?

44:48.619 --> 44:49.454
- No.

44:51.522 --> 44:52.357
No.

44:53.491 --> 44:55.593
- You know he was makin' bets?

44:55.593 --> 44:56.928
- I didn't know.

45:00.398 --> 45:01.366
- All right.

45:05.036 --> 45:09.140
I have to let him go,
'cause I could lose

45:09.140 --> 45:13.845
my license, all right, and I
know you were close to him.

45:13.845 --> 45:16.882
- He should be here right
now, training, he's an idiot.

45:16.882 --> 45:19.450
- Hey, settle the
fuck down, okay?

45:19.450 --> 45:20.685
The plan, the strategy,

45:20.685 --> 45:22.788
everything is still
the fuckin' same.

45:22.788 --> 45:24.422
I talked to somebody last night,

45:24.422 --> 45:26.291
showed 'em the tapes.

45:26.291 --> 45:28.894
They know exactly how
much you fuckin' suck

45:28.894 --> 45:32.330
on your inside
game, so it's good.

45:33.264 --> 45:36.567
- Joe, I mean--
- hey, for you,

45:36.567 --> 45:37.568
it's the same thing.

45:38.703 --> 45:40.671
You can't get distracted
by any of this shit.

45:41.539 --> 45:45.944
Fighting, gettin' better, Manny,

45:45.944 --> 45:48.479
that's all that should
be on your mind, okay?

45:49.815 --> 45:51.082
- And these guys
are gonna train me?

45:51.082 --> 45:52.050
- Yeah.

45:52.050 --> 45:53.484
- And they're good?

45:53.484 --> 45:55.453
- They're good, do you fuckin'
trust me, they're good.

45:55.453 --> 45:57.555
All right?
- Okay.

45:59.290 --> 46:01.559
- Okay, get back in there.

46:01.559 --> 46:04.229
(intense music)

46:49.007 --> 46:51.509
- And then afterwards she
took me to get drinks,

46:51.509 --> 46:53.111
and we were just talking
and she was giving me

46:53.111 --> 46:55.813
all these tips and
tricks, and I don't know,

46:55.813 --> 46:59.150
it was amazing, it's
just, I love it, you know?

46:59.150 --> 46:59.985
- Mm-hmm.

47:00.986 --> 47:02.153
- Am I boring you?

47:02.153 --> 47:03.388
- No, I'm proud of you.

47:03.388 --> 47:05.790
I'm just, my headache sucks.

47:05.790 --> 47:07.558
- Yeah, you're dehydrated.

47:07.558 --> 47:08.493
- Mm-hmm.

47:08.493 --> 47:10.261
- So what are you down to now?

47:10.261 --> 47:11.529
- 163.

47:11.529 --> 47:13.431
- Do you think you're
gonna make it in time?

47:13.431 --> 47:14.832
- Yeah, I'll be good.

47:23.541 --> 47:24.910
- Wanna get some sleep?

47:24.910 --> 47:25.743
- Mm-hmm.

47:28.813 --> 47:31.482
- Tell us, how did you put
this fight together, man?

47:31.482 --> 47:32.717
Tell the people at home a little

47:32.717 --> 47:33.985
about what's goin'
on here today.

47:33.985 --> 47:36.121
- Well, you know, it's
all God's work to me.

47:36.121 --> 47:38.323
You know, we have two
wonderful fighters

47:38.323 --> 47:40.558

52:02.187 --> 52:04.522
something that represents
where they came from

been about five weeks now.

56:32.156 --> 56:34.391
- That long, huh?
- Yeah.

56:34.391 --> 56:38.896
- Wow, he's a good kid, just
needs a little more time.

56:39.864 --> 56:42.032
- Yeah, I know, it just hasn't

56:42.032 --> 56:44.535
been the same without
him here, you know?

56:44.535 --> 56:45.803
- Yeah, I know.

56:48.338 --> 56:50.841
So Thursday?
- Thursday night.

56:50.841 --> 56:51.676
I'll have him ready.

56:51.676 --> 56:52.510
- Let's do it.

56:52.510 --> 56:53.611
- Let's do it.

56:53.611 --> 56:55.846
- Fantastic.
- All right, let's go.

57:02.453 --> 57:03.754
- Welcome, Ricky,
to the Morning Crane

57:03.754 --> 57:07.825
Healing Art Center, what
brings you here today?

57:07.825 --> 57:09.927
- I twisted my left ankle.

57:09.927 --> 57:11.462
- And how long ago
did you do this?

57:11.462 --> 57:12.497
- It was about a month ago.

57:12.497 --> 57:14.499
- About a month ago, okay.

57:14.499 --> 57:15.733
So you don't know if there's

57:15.733 --> 57:17.001
any fracture in
there or anything?

57:17.001 --> 57:18.435
- No, I don't--

57:18.435 --> 57:19.604
- don't think
there's a fracture?

57:19.604 --> 57:21.672
- I don't feel
anything like bone,

57:21.672 --> 57:23.674
just kind of feels
like a normal sprain.

57:28.312 --> 57:29.814
So there's definitely
blockage there?

57:29.814 --> 57:31.582
- Yeah, we're starting to
see it on the skin now.

57:31.582 --> 57:32.983
- Oh my god.

57:32.983 --> 57:34.685
- Okay, I'll get
as much as I can.

57:38.523 --> 57:40.390
- Now in this previously
stated statement,

57:40.390 --> 57:42.527
Mr. Wilkins denied
my client from even

57:42.527 --> 57:43.561
being employed.

57:44.695 --> 57:46.964
Now these pay stubs
and testimonies

57:46.964 --> 57:50.501
from co-workers prove
that to be false.

57:50.501 --> 57:51.902
- This is bullshit, man.

57:51.902 --> 57:53.370
I meant it to be different
and you know that.

57:53.370 --> 57:54.605
- Mr. Wilkins.

57:54.605 --> 57:56.607
- Let me handle this.

57:58.042 --> 57:59.877
- Mr. Wilkins, you will
have your chance to speak,

57:59.877 --> 58:02.747
but for now please
refrain from outbursting.

58:02.747 --> 58:04.481
- May I continue?

58:04.481 --> 58:05.415
- Proceed.

58:07.451 --> 58:09.153
- Now with these
documents I call

58:09.153 --> 58:12.422
to move forward with judgment
with no further delays or,

58:13.791 --> 58:15.560
or to schedule trial.

58:15.560 --> 58:18.262
- At this time I will let
the accused party rebuttal.

58:19.463 --> 58:23.734
- Uh, Your Honor,
one moment please.

58:29.807 --> 58:33.310
Your Honor, we'd like
to request for a recess

58:34.745 --> 58:38.583
and I highly suggest that
we settle this out of court.

58:38.583 --> 58:39.550
- Excuse me?

58:40.951 --> 58:42.687
I ain't afraid of
these bitches, man.

58:42.687 --> 58:45.723
Her, her, or her, they
don't fuckin' scare me, man.

58:45.723 --> 58:47.091
We got this, I'm
innocent here, yo.

58:47.091 --> 58:48.893
- Mr. Wilkins.

58:48.893 --> 58:50.728
- Would you knock it off?

58:50.728 --> 58:52.429
- Let me see this.

58:52.429 --> 58:56.066
- I highly suggest you listen
to your attorney, Mr. Wilkins.

58:56.066 --> 58:57.802
- I see what this is here.

58:57.802 --> 59:00.571
This is some kind of
woman's movement, huh?

59:00.571 --> 59:02.072
Just because I'm a man,

59:02.072 --> 59:03.708
you guys think you
can gang up on me

59:03.708 --> 59:05.542
and come down on me, right?

59:05.542 --> 59:07.812
That's what it's
all about, right?

59:07.812 --> 59:09.614
Come on, speak up, man,
you're my attorney.

59:09.614 --> 59:11.582
- Let me handle this.

59:11.582 --> 59:12.516
- Just go.

59:12.516 --> 59:15.552
- Okay, here we go.

59:15.552 --> 59:17.855
We settle this out of court.

59:17.855 --> 59:20.991
- Well, at this point
it looks like we won.

59:20.991 --> 59:22.226
So all we need to
do is just wait

59:22.226 --> 59:24.895
for the lawyer to call
us with the settlement.

59:24.895 --> 59:26.296
- I'm really happy for Georgia.

59:26.296 --> 59:28.298
- I know, it feels
good, doesn't it?

59:28.298 --> 59:29.834
- Yeah, I can see
why you do this,

59:29.834 --> 59:31.068
why you fight for the little guy

59:31.068 --> 59:33.203
instead of those
big corporations.

59:33.203 --> 59:35.372
- Yes, and I'm sure this is why

59:35.372 --> 59:36.874
you're gonna be doin'
it like this too.

59:36.874 --> 59:39.143
Now see, Georgia didn't
have a lot of money

59:39.143 --> 59:40.678
to pay us up front,

59:40.678 --> 59:43.180
but that doesn't mean she
didn't deserve justice.

59:44.649 --> 59:48.653
One more thing, next time
you come to court with me

59:49.854 --> 59:51.722
you've gotta leave the
pirate shirt at home.

59:51.722 --> 59:53.658
I need your hair
pulled back in a bun

59:53.658 --> 59:55.459
and I need a suit, okay?

59:55.459 --> 59:56.927
- Okay.

59:56.927 --> 59:58.796
- This is the big leagues
now, but you did good.

59:58.796 --> 59:59.897
- Thanks.
- Gimme five.

59:59.897 --> 01:00:01.766
- Big leagues.
- Big leagues.

01:00:07.672 --> 01:00:09.273
- Look at those
stuck up bitches.

01:00:09.273 --> 01:00:11.008
Think they're so smart,

01:00:11.008 --> 01:00:12.910
making me feel like
an idiot in there.

01:00:21.118 --> 01:00:24.889
(car crashing into object)

01:00:24.889 --> 01:00:28.425
(heart monitor beeping)

01:00:28.425 --> 01:00:31.028
- She suffered a lot of
swelling in the brain.

01:00:32.096 --> 01:00:33.330
We had to go in and relieve

01:00:33.330 --> 01:00:35.332
some of the pressure
caused by the trauma.

01:00:37.267 --> 01:00:40.671
She's in critical condition,
but stable nonetheless.

01:00:41.872 --> 01:00:43.173
At this point all we can do

01:00:43.173 --> 01:00:44.374
is be by her side
while she fights.

01:00:46.110 --> 01:00:47.344
I'm sorry.

01:00:47.344 --> 01:00:48.312
- Thank you, Doctor.

01:00:56.186 --> 01:00:57.354
- Are you gonna be okay?

01:00:58.622 --> 01:01:00.891
- Yeah, I'm just
takin' everything in.

01:01:03.127 --> 01:01:05.896
- Listen, I've been
doin' this a long time,

01:01:05.896 --> 01:01:08.999
and I've seen people come in
and out of here every day.

01:01:08.999 --> 01:01:12.369
Accidents happen, so if
you're blaming yourself

01:01:12.369 --> 01:01:15.405
you need to stop, it's
not helpin' anyone.

01:01:17.107 --> 01:01:20.477
You need to be strong for her.

01:01:22.512 --> 01:01:23.347
All right?

01:01:24.348 --> 01:01:25.315
- Thank you, Doctor.

01:01:25.315 --> 01:01:27.084
- [Nurse] Dr. Graham?

01:01:32.757 --> 01:01:34.825
- Are those the
parents of the patient?

01:01:34.825 --> 01:01:36.026
- Yeah, yeah.

01:01:39.429 --> 01:01:40.364
- What's up, buddy?

01:01:42.767 --> 01:01:45.903
- My name is Jolene, I'm
from the billing department.

01:01:45.903 --> 01:01:47.704
I understand this
is a rough time--

01:01:47.704 --> 01:01:50.507
- It's fine, what
can I do for you?

01:01:50.507 --> 01:01:52.642
- Well, what I have
here is information

01:01:52.642 --> 01:01:54.711
regarding her care here.

01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:58.148
Insurance will cover most
of her expenses but not all,

01:01:58.148 --> 01:02:02.486
so the amount here
is what is owed

01:02:02.486 --> 01:02:03.988
after insurance is deducted.

01:02:05.122 --> 01:02:07.524
- When does all of
that need to be paid?

01:02:07.524 --> 01:02:09.693
- Since we don't know how
long she'll be staying here

01:02:09.693 --> 01:02:12.096
we've broken it down
to monthly payments.

01:02:14.264 --> 01:02:17.167
- What happens if the
payments don't come in?

01:02:17.167 --> 01:02:19.403
- She would be moved
to another facility.

01:02:20.604 --> 01:02:22.072
I believe she's being
treated with the best

01:02:22.072 --> 01:02:23.673
medical care in the state,

01:02:23.673 --> 01:02:27.277
but a lot of the equipment
and surgeries performed

01:02:27.277 --> 01:02:30.014
would be considered
optional by insurance.

01:02:30.014 --> 01:02:32.316
I do think this is
the best for her,

01:02:32.316 --> 01:02:34.451
but I understand that this is--

01:02:35.886 --> 01:02:40.157
- It's okay, it's okay,
the payments will come in.

01:02:40.157 --> 01:02:41.425
Thank you, Jolene.

01:02:41.425 --> 01:02:42.259
- Thank you.

01:02:48.465 --> 01:02:50.034
- You know how
these contracts go,

01:02:50.034 --> 01:02:52.302
I mean their next event
is not till September.

01:02:52.302 --> 01:02:53.871
I mean, I can get you
on the card, Ricky,

01:02:53.871 --> 01:02:56.373
but I don't know if
you're gonna be ready,

01:02:56.373 --> 01:02:57.374
I mean, I don't know if you're

01:02:57.374 --> 01:02:59.643
in the right mindset for this.

01:02:59.643 --> 01:03:02.079
Maybe, maybe it's
time to take a break.

01:03:03.647 --> 01:03:04.581
- I can't take a break,

01:03:04.581 --> 01:03:05.816
I don't wanna take a break, Joe.

01:03:05.816 --> 01:03:07.651
I wanna fight and I
need to do somethin',

01:03:07.651 --> 01:03:10.587
and all I know how
to do is fight.

01:03:12.289 --> 01:03:13.657
That's all I know how to do.

01:03:17.928 --> 01:03:21.231
- All right, we can try
to work somethin' out.

01:03:22.933 --> 01:03:25.836
I mean, everybody here,
we're family, Ricky.

01:03:25.836 --> 01:03:26.803
We just wanna help.

01:03:28.505 --> 01:03:29.473
You goin' to the hospital?

01:03:29.473 --> 01:03:30.574
- Yeah.

01:03:30.574 --> 01:03:31.508
- Wanna lift?

01:03:31.508 --> 01:03:32.776
- That'd be great.

01:03:32.776 --> 01:03:33.610
- Come on.

01:03:41.218 --> 01:03:43.120
- You hangin' in there?

01:03:45.755 --> 01:03:48.125
- Can I ask you
somethin' personal?

01:03:48.125 --> 01:03:48.959
- Sure.

01:03:50.294 --> 01:03:52.696
- Do you think she can hear us?

01:03:52.696 --> 01:03:56.033
I mean I know she's not
conscious or anything,

01:03:56.033 --> 01:03:56.967
but--

01:03:56.967 --> 01:03:58.936
- I like to think they can.

01:04:00.270 --> 01:04:02.272
I like to think
they can hear us,

01:04:02.272 --> 01:04:06.110
feel us, and just being
here helps them recover.

01:04:07.577 --> 01:04:08.678
Don't lose hope, okay?

01:04:10.948 --> 01:04:11.781
- Thank you.

01:04:30.234 --> 01:04:32.402
I'm not very good at this.

01:04:36.273 --> 01:04:38.542
It's hard, you know,
seein' you this way.

01:04:48.652 --> 01:04:50.820
There's nothing I
want more than for you

01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:53.157
to be here with me right now.

01:04:55.859 --> 01:04:59.763
I miss you, I miss
you every day.

01:05:11.308 --> 01:05:14.444
Jab, hook, hook,
uppercut, all right.

01:05:49.713 --> 01:05:53.450
- Well, it looks like
her vitals are stable.

01:05:53.450 --> 01:05:54.684
I know you've done everything

01:05:54.684 --> 01:05:56.420
for her to be here,
it's not in vain.

01:05:58.488 --> 01:06:03.427
- I'm sorry, we've
been living modestly,

01:06:04.294 --> 01:06:05.395
off the grid for so long.

01:06:06.863 --> 01:06:08.865
If we had more money, I would,

01:06:13.103 --> 01:06:14.838
- It's gonna be okay.

01:06:25.249 --> 01:06:29.119
- Hey, hey doc, um can
I talk to you for a sec?

01:06:29.119 --> 01:06:30.420
- Yeah, sure.

01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:33.290
- Hey, my name's Joe,
I'm Ricky's fight coach.

01:06:33.290 --> 01:06:34.191
- Nice to meet you.

01:06:34.191 --> 01:06:35.825
- I just wanted to,

01:06:35.825 --> 01:06:38.162
I just wanted to thank
you and everybody here

01:06:38.162 --> 01:06:39.729
for everything you're
doing for this girl.

01:06:39.729 --> 01:06:41.198
- Of course.

01:06:41.198 --> 01:06:46.203
- Thing is, I know this
kid, he's a good kid.

01:06:46.936 --> 01:06:47.671
He loves this girl.

01:06:48.838 --> 01:06:50.107
He wants to build
a life with her

01:06:50.107 --> 01:06:54.010
and I kind of want
that for him too,

01:06:55.379 --> 01:06:56.313
but I don't want him to have to

01:06:56.313 --> 01:06:58.815
go on fightin' all his life.

01:06:58.815 --> 01:07:00.984
I want him to have a family.

01:07:00.984 --> 01:07:04.088
I guess I don't want
him to end up like me.

01:07:04.088 --> 01:07:05.489
So you gotta save her, okay,

01:07:06.356 --> 01:07:08.658
please, you gotta save her.

01:07:08.658 --> 01:07:10.260
- Listen to me very carefully,

01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:12.062
we are doin' everything we can.

01:07:13.230 --> 01:07:15.765
She's a fighter, just like him.

01:07:16.933 --> 01:07:18.302
You should be proud.

01:07:19.436 --> 01:07:22.038
- I am, thank you.

01:07:41.991 --> 01:07:43.127
- Hey, what's up Hunter?

01:07:43.127 --> 01:07:45.028
- How you doin', Luis?

01:07:45.028 --> 01:07:46.996
- Don't look like you're
here for trainin'?

01:07:46.996 --> 01:07:50.500
- Nah, not today,
this is my partner.

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:53.170
- Will.
- Luis, nice to meet you.

01:07:53.170 --> 01:07:55.205
- So is Rick around?

01:07:55.205 --> 01:07:56.240
- Yeah, man, he's in the back.

01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:57.474
You want me to go get him?

01:07:57.474 --> 01:07:58.408
- No, no, no, we'll
just go surprise him.

01:07:58.408 --> 01:08:00.076
We just need to talk to him.

01:08:02.346 --> 01:08:04.414
Remember about that thing
we talked about, right?

01:08:04.414 --> 01:08:06.350
- Yeah, I remember, man.

01:08:11.888 --> 01:08:13.390
- What's goin' on?

01:08:24.033 --> 01:08:25.469
- This is my partner.

01:08:25.469 --> 01:08:27.604
- Hey, Will.
- Rick.

01:08:27.604 --> 01:08:29.473
- Nice to meet you.

01:08:29.473 --> 01:08:31.006
- Look, we just
wanted you to know

01:08:31.006 --> 01:08:35.479
that we caught the person
we've been lookin' for,

01:08:35.479 --> 01:08:38.081
he's sittin' right
now in a jail cell

01:08:38.081 --> 01:08:43.086
while his people are tryin'
to like buy, or get a lawyer.

01:08:46.656 --> 01:08:51.661
Look, I know this isn't
gonna ease your mind, man,

01:08:52.529 --> 01:08:53.462
but I just wanted you to know

01:08:53.462 --> 01:08:56.466
that we caught that scumbag.

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:59.935
- Where, where is he now?

01:08:59.935 --> 01:09:01.537
- We've got him
down at county jail.

01:09:01.537 --> 01:09:02.538
- County?

01:09:02.538 --> 01:09:03.372
- That's right.

01:09:05.442 --> 01:09:07.444
Look, are you okay, man?

01:09:10.447 --> 01:09:11.747
Now I know how you feel.

01:09:14.651 --> 01:09:15.484
You fine?

01:09:17.754 --> 01:09:19.256
- I'm fine.
- all right.

01:09:19.256 --> 01:09:20.724
- I'm all right.

01:09:20.724 --> 01:09:24.528
- Look man, I'm so sorry
that this happened this way.

01:09:27.063 --> 01:09:27.897
- Yeah.

01:09:31.635 --> 01:09:33.970
I know, thank you, thank you.

01:09:33.970 --> 01:09:35.205
- We gotta roll.

01:09:35.205 --> 01:09:36.372
- Okay, you take
care of yourself,

01:09:36.372 --> 01:09:38.642
and I'll see you next class.

01:09:38.642 --> 01:09:39.809
I'm gonna bring Will with me.

01:09:39.809 --> 01:09:40.644
- Yeah.

01:09:41.877 --> 01:09:42.712
Yeah.

01:09:44.147 --> 01:09:47.082
(melancholy music)

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:07.203
- I'm headed to the
hospital, I'll be back later.

01:10:07.203 --> 01:10:08.905
- Hey, sit down.

01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:12.576
Sit down, grab somethin'
to eat, sit down.

01:10:12.576 --> 01:10:14.644
Gimme a second, sit down.

01:10:18.782 --> 01:10:20.650
Grab somethin' to eat.

01:10:20.650 --> 01:10:22.051
- I'm not hungry.

01:10:23.186 --> 01:10:25.555
- Well, it's not
about being hungry,

01:10:25.555 --> 01:10:27.424
it's about eating, you
gotta take care of yourself,

01:10:27.424 --> 01:10:28.658
I mean you're the one
that told me, right,

01:10:28.658 --> 01:10:31.528
if you eat right
you think better?

01:10:32.696 --> 01:10:33.763
Just grab a bite.

01:10:35.699 --> 01:10:37.734
- I'll eat later, will
that make you happy?

01:10:39.202 --> 01:10:41.070
- It's not about
making me happy.

01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:42.972
It's about you taking
care of yourself.

01:10:48.044 --> 01:10:50.280
- I gotta lot goin'
on right now, okay?

01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:52.449
I don't have time to
think about everything.

01:10:56.185 --> 01:10:57.487
- Yeah, we'll talk later.

01:11:06.730 --> 01:11:07.997
- Is that right?

01:11:07.997 --> 01:11:11.368
Joe was not happy about
what he just found out.

01:11:12.769 --> 01:11:15.104
No, he wasn't supposed to
find out, are you kiddin' me?

01:11:16.573 --> 01:11:20.109
No, it's business with him,
so I completely understand.

01:11:20.109 --> 01:11:25.114
Freakin' Rick gave me a
freakin' call, and shit.

01:11:26.282 --> 01:11:27.884
Oh man, you know what,
lemme call you back.

01:11:29.218 --> 01:11:31.321
Yeah, so let me call
you back, all right?

01:11:32.322 --> 01:11:33.156
Okay.

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:41.565
Shit, Ricky, what are
you doin' here, man?

01:11:46.936 --> 01:11:51.908
I mean, look, you
should be learning

01:11:53.076 --> 01:11:54.644
through what I'm goin'
through right now.

01:11:56.646 --> 01:12:01.050
It's not an easy
situation, you understand?

01:12:01.050 --> 01:12:03.820
So I, I, I understand
what you're goin' through,

01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:07.056
but do you really wanna
take on this path?

01:12:08.124 --> 01:12:09.726
- How much can I make per fight?

01:12:10.894 --> 01:12:12.596
- Rick, this is
dirty money, man.

01:12:14.030 --> 01:12:16.966
This is dirty money, okay,
I don't wish this upon you.

01:12:18.134 --> 01:12:19.969
I wish things were
different with this.

01:12:20.970 --> 01:12:21.905
Are you sure you
wanna go ahead--

01:12:21.905 --> 01:12:23.106
- When can you set it up?

01:12:27.010 --> 01:12:29.345
- The next one's in
two and a half weeks.

01:12:29.345 --> 01:12:30.213
- Set it up.

01:12:31.147 --> 01:12:31.981
- All right.

01:12:34.618 --> 01:12:35.452
Okay.

01:12:38.522 --> 01:12:43.527
Ricky, fuck, man, I'm
sorry about Danielle, man.

01:12:45.161 --> 01:12:46.696
I wish things were different.

01:13:26.703 --> 01:13:28.638
- Hey, what's up, Rick?

01:13:29.473 --> 01:13:31.975
How you holdin' up, bro?

01:13:31.975 --> 01:13:33.142
You good, man?

01:13:35.645 --> 01:13:37.046
So what you been up to, man?

01:13:40.517 --> 01:13:41.718
- I went to go see Rudy.

01:13:43.820 --> 01:13:44.621
- You what?

01:13:45.855 --> 01:13:47.757
- Just now, just
came back from there.

01:13:49.459 --> 01:13:50.293
- For what, man?

01:13:52.729 --> 01:13:53.697
- I need money.

01:13:53.697 --> 01:13:58.334
- Rick, Rick, Rick, look man,

01:13:59.736 --> 01:14:02.138
Rudy's your boy, and
that's my boy too,

01:14:02.138 --> 01:14:04.641
but what he did, that
was his decision.

01:14:05.642 --> 01:14:06.843
That's below you, dog.

01:14:06.843 --> 01:14:08.144
All right, but
that's not you, man,

01:14:08.144 --> 01:14:10.046
I'm not gonna see you
go out like that, okay?

01:14:10.046 --> 01:14:13.016
So I'm gonna need you
to be serious, okay?

01:14:13.016 --> 01:14:14.818
- I am serious, man.

01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:18.688
This is a serious
fuckin' matter.

01:14:20.056 --> 01:14:21.925
- Rick, I understand
how you feel,

01:14:21.925 --> 01:14:24.794
all right, but you're
just gonna risk it all?

01:14:24.794 --> 01:14:26.029
Is that what you're gonna do?

01:14:26.029 --> 01:14:28.097
- She is all, man,
I got nothin' else.

01:14:28.097 --> 01:14:29.398
- I understand that.

01:14:29.398 --> 01:14:31.835
- I got nothin'
else man, I'm goin'.

01:14:34.604 --> 01:14:36.472
- Rick.
- Do you know how it's been?

01:14:38.742 --> 01:14:41.044
What my daily life is?

01:14:41.044 --> 01:14:43.012
Seein' her layin'
down in the hospital?

01:14:44.881 --> 01:14:48.652
- So what, man, you just
gonna throw it all away?

01:14:49.653 --> 01:14:50.486
- Man--

01:14:51.888 --> 01:14:53.456
- Man, I look up to you, man.

01:14:55.692 --> 01:14:57.426
This used to be
everything to you

01:14:57.426 --> 01:14:59.929
and you gonna throw it all away?

01:14:59.929 --> 01:15:01.330
No, man, I'm not havin' that.

01:15:02.999 --> 01:15:05.068
- I know what I'm doin'.

01:15:05.068 --> 01:15:07.003
I know it's fuckin' awful.

01:15:07.003 --> 01:15:09.773
I know who he is
and what he does.

01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:12.742
But I gotta do somethin'.

01:15:12.742 --> 01:15:14.310
- Dude, I know
what you lost, man,

01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:16.613
and right now you're
desperate, all right?

01:15:16.613 --> 01:15:17.947
But you my boy, man,

01:15:17.947 --> 01:15:20.049
I'm not about to go in there

01:15:20.049 --> 01:15:21.417
and lay my head on that pillow

01:15:21.417 --> 01:15:22.919
and know what you're
out there doin'.

01:15:22.919 --> 01:15:25.488
I'm not gonna let you
go out like that, man.

01:15:25.488 --> 01:15:28.457
Look, I know you miss her,
she's layin' up in there,

01:15:28.457 --> 01:15:29.693
nobody wants to
see her like that.

01:15:29.693 --> 01:15:31.527
- I can't lose her.

01:15:31.527 --> 01:15:33.362
What am I supposed
to do if she dies?

01:15:36.132 --> 01:15:38.201
- I know, I know, I know.

01:15:40.737 --> 01:15:44.708
I got you, man, you
my boy, all right?

01:15:44.708 --> 01:15:46.475
We're in this together.

01:15:52.515 --> 01:15:56.786
- Hey Joe, think I can
speak to you for a moment?

01:15:56.786 --> 01:15:57.987
- Yeah, sure, what's up?

01:15:59.422 --> 01:16:04.293
- Yesterday after I left work
I, sorry, sorry about that.

01:16:12.301 --> 01:16:14.003
It's a message
from the hospital.

01:16:14.003 --> 01:16:15.238
- What does it say?

01:16:15.238 --> 01:16:17.506
- It just says for
me to go there.

01:16:17.506 --> 01:16:19.008
- You want a ride?

01:16:19.008 --> 01:16:20.777
- Yeah, that'd be
fine, thank you.

01:16:20.777 --> 01:16:22.045
Thank you.

01:16:22.045 --> 01:16:24.080
- If you guys need
someone to talk to

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:25.514
we have a chaplain available,

01:16:26.650 --> 01:16:28.184
I'd be glad to have
someone bring him down,

01:16:28.184 --> 01:16:30.887
or take you guys
somewhere private.

01:16:32.956 --> 01:16:36.159
- What's goin' on?
- Mr. Torres.

01:16:36.159 --> 01:16:37.093
- What's goin' on?

01:16:37.093 --> 01:16:38.427
- There were complications.

01:16:39.595 --> 01:16:41.798
Her brain swelling took
a turn for the worse.

01:16:43.767 --> 01:16:45.702
- Oh Ricky, she's gone.

01:16:49.272 --> 01:16:54.277
- I'm sorry, we've done
everything we could do.

01:17:49.933 --> 01:17:52.601
(clock ticking)

01:18:00.043 --> 01:18:01.310
- How you doin'?

01:18:05.581 --> 01:18:07.483
You need to eat something,
I cooked something.

01:18:07.483 --> 01:18:08.651
Would you like dinner?

01:18:08.651 --> 01:18:10.820
- No, I'm not hungry.

01:18:10.820 --> 01:18:12.421
- Come on, you need to eat.

01:18:12.421 --> 01:18:13.723
- I wanna watch TV.

01:18:15.925 --> 01:18:17.827
- I'm gonna have
your dad talk to you.

01:18:33.409 --> 01:18:35.011
- What's up?

01:18:35.011 --> 01:18:37.280
- Did you go train today?

01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:38.347
- I hadda teach.

01:18:39.615 --> 01:18:40.449
- Yeah.

01:18:41.650 --> 01:18:42.852
- 4:30 5:30 kids.

01:18:44.487 --> 01:18:45.388
- Those little guys.

01:18:45.388 --> 01:18:47.390
- Yeah, goin' crazy.

01:18:50.059 --> 01:18:51.327
- You have patience,

01:18:51.327 --> 01:18:53.830
I've seen you work
with those kids.

01:18:53.830 --> 01:18:55.965
It takes a lot of patience,

01:18:55.965 --> 01:18:58.134
I wouldn't be able to do it.

01:18:58.134 --> 01:18:58.968
- It's fun.

01:19:02.305 --> 01:19:06.475
- So, let me ask you something.
Are you gonna fight again?

01:19:12.615 --> 01:19:14.417
- I don't, I don't think so.

01:19:17.753 --> 01:19:20.089
I don't feel like I need
to any more, you know?

01:19:21.524 --> 01:19:25.061
- Yeah, but you never needed to,

01:19:25.061 --> 01:19:27.663
you always, you wanted to.
It's a passion you had.

01:19:33.602 --> 01:19:37.340
- I don't think I want
to any more, you know?

01:19:38.541 --> 01:19:40.743
I don't really know
what I'm supposed to do.

01:19:42.245 --> 01:19:44.213
Will you tell me what
to do and I'll do it?

01:19:45.381 --> 01:19:48.251
- Can't tell you what
to do, I can't, son.

01:19:48.251 --> 01:19:51.087
This has gotta come from you,

01:19:52.421 --> 01:19:53.990
it's gotta come from your heart.

01:19:55.791 --> 01:19:56.860
I know you're hurt right now,

01:19:56.860 --> 01:19:58.694
I know you're feeling pain.

01:19:59.795 --> 01:20:00.729
I've been there.

01:20:03.132 --> 01:20:07.336
I think about your
grandma every day.

01:20:08.704 --> 01:20:10.273
I lost my brothers,
you know that,

01:20:10.273 --> 01:20:11.574
and I lost friends.

01:20:14.844 --> 01:20:16.412
But you gotta move on.

01:20:17.546 --> 01:20:19.548
You gotta move on,
you gotta think about

01:20:19.548 --> 01:20:22.118
the memories you
have with the people.

01:20:25.421 --> 01:20:27.690
And it's just life,
you just never know

01:20:27.690 --> 01:20:28.925
when someone's gonna go,

01:20:28.925 --> 01:20:31.360
and that's why it
kills me to see the way

01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:33.762
you and your brother treat
each other sometimes.

01:20:35.698 --> 01:20:36.966
You know, I love you guys,

01:20:36.966 --> 01:20:38.868
I would do anything
for you guys,

01:20:40.103 --> 01:20:41.337
and I know it's not easy,

01:20:43.372 --> 01:20:46.542
but you have us here, yeah,
don't go through it alone.

01:20:49.645 --> 01:20:53.216
I love you, you're my
boy, you're strong.

01:20:55.084 --> 01:20:56.319
I love you kid.

01:21:03.292 --> 01:21:06.195
(melancholy music)

01:21:21.010 --> 01:21:24.680
- Your strengths, you strike
him on the outside, right?

01:21:26.682 --> 01:21:28.484
Hi Ricky.
- Hey.

01:21:28.484 --> 01:21:29.919
- You teachin' class today?

01:21:29.919 --> 01:21:32.021
- Yeah, 4:30 to 5:30 kids.

01:21:32.021 --> 01:21:33.322
- Those kids are a
handful now, Ricky,

01:21:33.322 --> 01:21:35.024
you want any help?

01:21:35.024 --> 01:21:36.259
- No, I'm okay.

01:21:38.161 --> 01:21:38.995
- Okay.

01:21:41.931 --> 01:21:44.367
Hey, Ricky.
- Yeah?

01:21:44.367 --> 01:21:46.202
- Good to have you back.

01:21:46.202 --> 01:21:47.570
- Thanks guys, see ya.
