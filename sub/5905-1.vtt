00:34.243 --> 00:35.868
Hello, Mr. Hindle,

00:35.953 --> 00:39.539
or as they called you
around the hospital, Zepp.

00:45.713 --> 00:47.046
Game over!

02:43.539 --> 02:45.039
Check it, man.

03:13.443 --> 03:14.569
What the fuck is this?

03:14.903 --> 03:18.072
What the fuck are you doing here?

03:19.116 --> 03:20.408
I'm fucking stuck.

03:21.159 --> 03:22.159
Yeah, me too.

03:22.744 --> 03:24.829
- What the fuck?
- Oh, my God.

03:25.998 --> 03:27.248
Somebody, help us.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.500
- Hello.
- Come on, help us!

03:32.254 --> 03:33.504
Oh, my God!

03:36.925 --> 03:37.925
Dina.

03:38.010 --> 03:39.093
Brad.

03:40.095 --> 03:43.139
- Ryan?
- Baby, are you okay?

03:43.640 --> 03:45.391
- Get me out of here!
- Baby.

03:45.475 --> 03:47.977
Help us. Somebody help us!

03:48.770 --> 03:50.855
Hey! Call the police!

03:50.939 --> 03:52.523
Hey, break the glass with your case.

03:52.608 --> 03:54.817
Break the fucking glass! Do it.

03:54.902 --> 03:56.444
Stay back!

03:58.113 --> 03:59.447
Do it!

04:00.365 --> 04:02.491
- Get me out of here.
- Break it!

04:07.331 --> 04:08.372
Hello, Brad.

04:09.625 --> 04:12.752
Hello, Ryan. I'd like to play a game.

04:13.420 --> 04:16.880
The same woman
has played each of you for a fool,

04:16.964 --> 04:21.135
manipulating your love for her,
and causing nothing but pain.

04:21.219 --> 04:27.308
Her fun and games pushed you both
to break the law to fulfill her material needs.

04:27.809 --> 04:28.976
She is toxic,

04:29.394 --> 04:34.065
and today all of your transgressions
will be made public.

04:34.149 --> 04:35.691
He's fucking lying, Brad.

04:35.776 --> 04:39.779
Now you must choose who
will drop out of this triangle,

04:39.863 --> 04:43.199
for within 60 seconds one of you must die.

04:44.409 --> 04:47.745
If you wish to save her,
then the saws must be pushed

04:47.829 --> 04:50.665
all the way to one side or the other,

04:50.749 --> 04:55.586
sparing her while proving for good
who is indeed the alpha male.

04:55.671 --> 04:58.255
What are you fucking staring at,
you motherfuckers?

04:58.340 --> 05:00.591
- Do something!
- Are you both strong enough

05:00.676 --> 05:03.427
to walk away from what is destroying you,

05:03.512 --> 05:07.306
or will you fight one more time
for the heart that binds?

05:08.058 --> 05:10.267
You have 60 seconds to decide.

05:10.686 --> 05:13.104
Live or die. Make your choice.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.149
Oh, fuck!

05:24.324 --> 05:26.409
One of you save me!

05:34.793 --> 05:35.793
What the fuck are you doing?

05:35.877 --> 05:38.587
It's me or you asshole,
and it sure as shit isn't gonna be me.

05:51.727 --> 05:52.893
Brad. Brad.

05:53.895 --> 05:55.146
Brad, I love you.

05:56.314 --> 05:57.565
I love you too, baby.

05:57.899 --> 05:59.775
Do it. You gotta do it.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.736
- What?
- You gotta kill him, Brad.

06:02.195 --> 06:03.904
- Do it!
- Stupid bitch!

06:03.989 --> 06:06.449
Do it. Do it! Do it!

06:18.170 --> 06:19.170
Fuck!

06:22.299 --> 06:23.424
You love him?

06:23.717 --> 06:24.925
No, no.

06:25.010 --> 06:26.469
You love him more than me?

06:26.803 --> 06:28.763
No, I had to say that.

06:29.139 --> 06:30.848
I've always loved you.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.476
You got to do it for me, please.

06:33.894 --> 06:36.437
You got to kill him. Kill Brad! Do it!

06:37.105 --> 06:38.939
You lying slut!

06:40.108 --> 06:41.442
What the fuck are you doing?

06:41.526 --> 06:42.651
You don't love anybody!

06:44.196 --> 06:46.072
You're a cheat and a liar. Fuck you!

06:46.156 --> 06:47.448
Fuck you!

06:48.575 --> 06:50.367
Brad! Brad, look at me!

06:51.787 --> 06:54.830
Is the chick that fucked me in your bed
two days ago worth one of our lives?

06:55.540 --> 06:57.416
She's not worth it, man. She's not worth it.

06:58.210 --> 06:59.210
Right?

07:01.296 --> 07:02.379
Yeah!

07:02.881 --> 07:04.840
What are you doing, you fucking asshole?

07:05.133 --> 07:07.176
I think we're breaking up with you, Dina.

07:09.930 --> 07:12.181
No! No, stop!

07:19.731 --> 07:21.232
- Stand aside!
- Move it!

07:27.364 --> 07:29.115
People, get out of the way.

07:48.093 --> 07:49.552
Somebody help her.

08:17.831 --> 08:18.789
Game over.

08:18.874 --> 08:21.333
No! No, you fucking bitch!

08:21.960 --> 08:23.002
No!

10:04.187 --> 10:07.189
Tonight, a house of horrors
has been discovered

10:07.274 --> 10:10.609
at what used to be known
as the Rowan Zoological Institute.

10:10.694 --> 10:15.072
The body of Umbrella Health CEO
William Easton has been identified

10:15.156 --> 10:18.575
as one of the several victims
of this grizzly crime scene.

10:18.660 --> 10:20.995
However, we have also been
informed that there may be

10:24.499 --> 10:26.667
Hopefully the many questions
of the local police,

10:26.751 --> 10:30.087
the FBI, and the victims'
family members may be answered

10:30.171 --> 10:32.298
by those seven civilians lucky enough

10:32.382 --> 10:34.675
to walk away from
this unprecedented display

10:34.759 --> 10:36.802
of carnage with their lives.

10:36.886 --> 10:41.348
We now go live to Tony Gabrielson
who is reporting from the scene. Tony.

10:47.230 --> 10:49.315
- Hey, man.
- Hey, what's up?

10:51.318 --> 10:54.278
- What have we got here?
- That's Jill Tuck, Jigsaw's widow.

10:54.362 --> 10:55.487
What does she want?

10:55.572 --> 10:57.489
All she said was that
she didn't trust the FBI,

10:58.199 --> 11:00.492
- and she didn't trust homicide.
- Good.

11:01.244 --> 11:03.370
And she just wants to talk to you.

11:04.706 --> 11:07.416
- Why me?
- I don't know. Only you, though.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.714
She looks crazier than a sack full of cats.

11:15.717 --> 11:18.218
All right, let's get this over with.

11:23.683 --> 11:26.727
Hey. I put cream and sugar in it.

11:27.604 --> 11:29.521
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

11:29.606 --> 11:32.066
I'm Matt Gibson, internal affairs.

11:32.650 --> 11:34.568
My colleague said that you
wanted to speak with me.

11:34.652 --> 11:35.736
Yes.

11:36.988 --> 11:39.114
But I need complete immunity.

11:41.076 --> 11:43.202
Why do you want immunity, Miss Tuck?

11:44.913 --> 11:46.830
Because of what I know.

11:47.457 --> 11:48.957
Which is what?

11:50.335 --> 11:52.127
Do we have a deal?

11:53.004 --> 11:56.924
You've got to give before you can receive
in this house, Jill.

11:59.302 --> 12:02.846
My husband John, he had an accomplice.

12:04.265 --> 12:06.517
A person who assisted him
with almost every murder.

12:06.601 --> 12:08.018
Look, don't get me wrong.

12:08.103 --> 12:12.231
I'm all ears if you've got something legit
that you want to put on the table.

12:13.942 --> 12:16.735
This person will go on killing
until he's stopped.

12:17.404 --> 12:20.948
- You know him and he definitely knows you.
- Is that right?

12:22.075 --> 12:23.742
He's detective Mark Hoffman.

12:25.620 --> 12:27.496
Are you willing to sign a sworn affidavit?

12:28.248 --> 12:29.289
Yes.

12:29.791 --> 12:31.083
You swear to be totally open?

12:31.167 --> 12:33.961
You tell me everything,
no matter how personal or private?

12:34.045 --> 12:35.129
Yes.

12:35.630 --> 12:38.298
I'll give you evidence, whatever you want,

12:39.300 --> 12:43.137
as long as I have your protection,
and complete immunity.

12:44.472 --> 12:45.556
Do we have a deal?

12:45.640 --> 12:48.016
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we have a deal.

13:25.847 --> 13:27.389
Welcome back!

13:27.474 --> 13:30.559
We're live with Bobby Dagen
whose national tour

13:30.643 --> 13:33.437
S.U.R.V.I.V.E.
My Story of Overcoming Jigsaw

13:33.521 --> 13:35.689
rolls into town this weekend.

13:36.232 --> 13:39.026
Well, you're quite the national phenomenon
these days, aren't you?

13:39.652 --> 13:41.528
Well, thank you, ma'am.

13:41.613 --> 13:44.448
It's quite flattering how many people
have responded to my story.

13:44.532 --> 13:49.620
And if I can help a few people along the way,
then I'm pleased.

13:49.704 --> 13:54.082
Now, you survived a trap created
by the infamous Jigsaw killer, correct?

13:54.459 --> 13:55.459
Yes, ma'am.

13:55.543 --> 13:59.046
Well, everyone must ask you this question.
What was that like?

14:01.382 --> 14:03.008
Life changing.

14:03.092 --> 14:05.302
It was something I never anticipated

14:05.386 --> 14:07.971
and, quite honestly, something
that should have killed me.

14:08.056 --> 14:11.725
Tell me more.
Tell me about the actual experience.

14:11.809 --> 14:14.770
I actually have no recollection
of how I got there.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.481
I just remember the feeling

14:17.565 --> 14:19.900
of waking up trapped.

14:20.693 --> 14:24.780
And I had to insert two hooks
into my pectoral muscles

14:24.864 --> 14:26.365
and hoist myself up to a platform.

14:26.449 --> 14:27.783
You put the hooks in yourself?

14:28.409 --> 14:29.409
I did.

14:29.786 --> 14:32.788
I pretty much realized
that I couldn't hold on much longer,

14:34.249 --> 14:38.585
and I had to accept the fact
that I was going to die.

14:38.670 --> 14:40.879
And then I saw something,

14:40.964 --> 14:42.506
and what I saw was my life.

14:43.591 --> 14:46.885
It was a tragedy. I achieved nothing.

14:48.846 --> 14:53.433
And right then,
something inside me started to grow,

14:54.602 --> 14:57.062
something from the bottom of my soul.

14:57.689 --> 15:01.066
And I just... I decided to live.

15:01.150 --> 15:04.069
I found a strength that I thought
had long since expired.

15:04.153 --> 15:06.863
And I just yanked, and I yanked!

15:06.948 --> 15:10.200
And when I got to the top,
I just ripped the hooks out of my chest.

15:10.285 --> 15:14.037
There was blood everywhere,
and I just screamed.

15:14.122 --> 15:17.708
I just sat there and screamed.

15:17.792 --> 15:20.544
Because I hadn't just survived,

15:20.628 --> 15:22.421
I was reborn.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.464
This was my life.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.764
Wow. Bobby Dagen, everyone.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.892
Bobby's life-changing
experience comes to the...

15:35.977 --> 15:37.644
This is the moment.

15:38.062 --> 15:40.272
- Where's the big kiss?
- I don't know.

15:40.356 --> 15:41.857
Tickets are still available.

15:42.317 --> 15:43.859
And we're out, folks.

15:44.819 --> 15:46.570
- That's not the way it's supposed to be.
- You need to relax.

15:46.654 --> 15:48.113
No, we rehearsed it differently.

15:50.491 --> 15:52.451
It's okay. Nice work, Bobby.

15:53.328 --> 15:55.454
Ladies, can you excuse us for a minute?

15:57.373 --> 15:59.291
Where was the big finish, Bobby?

15:59.375 --> 16:00.917
You tell your story,
you thank your pretty wife,

16:01.002 --> 16:02.294
you bring her out for a big hug and kiss.

16:02.378 --> 16:03.962
I just didn't want to push it, all right?

16:04.047 --> 16:05.839
Okay, but that's the heart of the story.

16:06.174 --> 16:08.300
She was there for your whole recovery.

16:08.384 --> 16:11.094
And without the acknowledgment,
without the kiss,

16:11.179 --> 16:13.472
the audience isn't gonna have any kind
of emotional connection.

16:13.556 --> 16:14.556
I disagree.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.433
Too much emotion,
and it's gonna feel like pandering.

16:16.517 --> 16:18.602
Okay, why don't you let me
do the public relations,

16:18.686 --> 16:19.853
and you do the legal paperwork, okay?

16:19.937 --> 16:22.731
Okay, I get it, Suzanne, all right?
It's my fault.

16:22.815 --> 16:25.192
It wasn't your fault, Bobby.

16:25.276 --> 16:26.777
You were fine.

16:26.861 --> 16:28.654
- Just remember your bullet points next time.
- I will.

16:28.738 --> 16:30.072
These interviews are important.

16:30.156 --> 16:31.948
Nina, relax.

16:32.033 --> 16:33.033
Don't worry about them.

16:33.451 --> 16:34.785
You were great.

16:34.869 --> 16:36.119
Yeah?

16:36.204 --> 16:38.205
Your story's real and people feel that.

16:39.540 --> 16:44.127
I know that you get overwhelmed at times,
but we have to keep moving forward, Bobby.

16:46.381 --> 16:48.382
You were meant to do this.

16:52.220 --> 16:54.721
I know. I know, baby.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.808
- Bobby.
- Yeah?

16:57.892 --> 16:59.601
We got the Jigsaw survivor group tomorrow.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.478
Thirty minutes of face time
with other survivors.

17:01.562 --> 17:03.605
Yeah, sounds good.

17:03.690 --> 17:07.401
- Nothing more exciting than that.
- No, not much. Let's go.

17:50.278 --> 17:51.319
Oh, God!

17:51.821 --> 17:54.281
You want to know the only thing wrong
with killing you, Jill?

17:56.117 --> 17:57.534
I can only do it once.

18:07.545 --> 18:08.545
Oh, my God!

18:19.932 --> 18:20.974
No!

18:47.794 --> 18:50.337
Help me! Help me!

18:50.671 --> 18:52.923
Help! Fuck!

18:54.383 --> 18:57.594
Hello, Evan. I want to play a game.

18:57.678 --> 19:01.306
The situation you find yourself in
is of your own doing.

19:01.390 --> 19:05.852
You, your girlfriend,
and your friends are all racists.

19:07.355 --> 19:09.314
Evan, you fuck. You get me out of here!

19:09.690 --> 19:13.610
You have intimidated others
based on their physical differences.

19:13.694 --> 19:16.947
But today it is you who will run scared.

19:17.031 --> 19:21.159
Your pathetic friends
follow your every word, Evan.

19:21.244 --> 19:27.499
Therefore you will be the only one capable
of saving them and yourself.

19:29.544 --> 19:33.672
In 30 seconds,
the jacks holding up this car will fall,

19:35.883 --> 19:38.301
setting off a deadly chain of events.

19:38.386 --> 19:40.512
In order to stop this from happening,

19:40.596 --> 19:45.976
you must tear yourself away
from the seat to which you are glued.

19:46.060 --> 19:51.398
Then you must pull the red lever before you.
But no act comes without a sacrifice.

19:51.816 --> 19:54.734
You've judged others
by the color of their skin,

19:54.819 --> 20:01.241
and today, Evan, you will learn
that we are all the same color on the inside.

20:01.617 --> 20:04.619
Live or die, Evan, the choice is yours.

20:09.083 --> 20:10.292
No!

20:16.799 --> 20:18.967
- Evan, help!
- I can't.

20:21.137 --> 20:23.763
- Do it. Fuck!
- Fucking do it!

20:23.848 --> 20:25.348
Just fucking do it!

20:25.433 --> 20:27.350
Do it! Do it, man!

20:27.435 --> 20:28.518
Here I go!

20:35.109 --> 20:36.484
Evan!

20:36.569 --> 20:38.445
Baby, get me out of here!

20:38.529 --> 20:41.740
Shit! Fuck! Here I go!

20:41.824 --> 20:43.491
Here I go! Come on!

20:43.576 --> 20:44.826
Fuck me!

20:49.624 --> 20:50.957
Please!

21:00.885 --> 21:03.595
- God!
- Do it! Fucking do it!

21:03.679 --> 21:05.597
- God!
- Do it!

21:06.474 --> 21:09.184
- Evan!
- You got us into this.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.852
Get us the fuck out!

21:13.731 --> 21:15.106
Do it!

21:18.986 --> 21:20.236
You fucking pussy!

21:31.499 --> 21:32.666
Shit.

22:01.654 --> 22:03.113
Every night

22:04.657 --> 22:08.368
I keep thinking that things will get better

22:09.245 --> 22:12.288
the next morning when I wake up.

22:12.373 --> 22:13.873
But it isn't.

22:14.709 --> 22:16.543
Everything I do,

22:18.754 --> 22:21.715
everything I see, I'm surrounded by these

22:23.050 --> 22:24.843
tiny triggers.

22:25.261 --> 22:26.678
They're everywhere,

22:27.263 --> 22:29.097
and they remind me of what I went through,

22:29.807 --> 22:31.558
what Jigsaw did to me.

22:33.394 --> 22:36.479
Sidney, go on, please. You're...

22:36.564 --> 22:39.149
You're in a safe place now.

22:39.233 --> 22:40.692
Tell me what happened next.

22:42.278 --> 22:45.655
Alex! Stop, please! Stop it!

23:01.589 --> 23:02.964
Sidney, look at me.

23:05.259 --> 23:06.926
You made a decision.

23:07.636 --> 23:09.429
How did that make you feel?

23:09.805 --> 23:10.930
Free.

23:12.892 --> 23:14.642
He was abusive.

23:15.186 --> 23:17.937
I tried to stop it before,

23:18.397 --> 23:20.565
but it wasn't until that moment

23:21.275 --> 23:22.942
that I really did something.

23:23.819 --> 23:26.905
It was him or me, and I chose to live.

23:26.989 --> 23:28.990
It was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

23:31.285 --> 23:33.787
That's a bunch of bullshit.

23:34.955 --> 23:37.290
He had to die for you to leave him?

23:40.127 --> 23:42.796
You want to know
the best thing that happened to me

23:42.880 --> 23:45.131
after having to cut off my own arm?

23:49.386 --> 23:52.806
It's handicapped parking at the damn mall!

23:57.228 --> 24:00.313
What the hell is a camera here for anyway?

24:02.608 --> 24:05.902
I am simply here to illustrate the fact
that a traumatic experience,

24:05.986 --> 24:09.447
such as the kind that each one of us
has been forced to endure,

24:09.532 --> 24:12.283
can have a positive outcome. That's all.

24:12.368 --> 24:14.285
Yeah? Like what?

24:15.663 --> 24:19.165
A new perspective on life. Wait, wait, wait.

24:20.960 --> 24:25.171
I know. I understand
that you're not at that place yet.

24:25.714 --> 24:28.424
I understand that and I respect that.

24:28.509 --> 24:30.176
But if you look around at all these people

24:30.636 --> 24:32.512
taking their lives for granted,

24:33.180 --> 24:37.642
eventually they all found something positive
from their experience.

24:37.726 --> 24:40.186
We should never be ashamed
of what we've gone through,

24:40.271 --> 24:43.022
because we are good and we are strong!

24:45.693 --> 24:47.110
You know what?

24:47.194 --> 24:50.822
I'd like everybody to have
a look at something right here.

24:51.574 --> 24:54.200
These are my scars.

24:56.871 --> 24:58.788
Because our minds will heal,

25:00.541 --> 25:02.041
but these scars will never go away.

25:03.210 --> 25:06.254
These scars should not be
a symbol of shame.

25:06.338 --> 25:08.256
They should be worn as a badge of courage.

25:10.718 --> 25:12.010
You know, earlier,

25:12.094 --> 25:17.223
I spoke of valuing your loved ones.

25:18.559 --> 25:19.976
But to be perfectly honest,

25:20.060 --> 25:22.979
it's something that I never did
prior to my ordeal.

25:23.063 --> 25:24.606
But since then,

25:25.357 --> 25:29.652
I have found someone
who has truly become my rock.

25:32.865 --> 25:33.907
Joyce, if you could...

25:35.367 --> 25:36.367
Please.

25:39.371 --> 25:41.497
It's my lovely wife Joyce.

25:42.750 --> 25:45.710
- I love you.
- I love you too, baby.

25:57.014 --> 25:58.348
Bravo.

25:59.391 --> 26:02.393
To be able to sustain
such a traumatic experience,

26:02.478 --> 26:06.773
and yet find the positive in that grizzly act,

26:07.608 --> 26:09.943
it's a remarkable feat indeed.

26:12.613 --> 26:14.447
Remarkable,

26:15.616 --> 26:17.784
if not a little perverse.

26:20.120 --> 26:23.122
I'm sure I speak for everyone
here when I say

26:23.207 --> 26:25.750
how grateful we are

26:26.377 --> 26:31.339
to be part of your promotional DVD.

26:38.931 --> 26:41.140
I appreciate it. Thank you. It's...

26:48.148 --> 26:50.650
- I can take that, sir.
- Thank you very much.

26:51.151 --> 26:52.443
Joyce, can I borrow him for a second?

26:52.528 --> 26:53.861
Sure. I'll be in the car, okay?

26:53.946 --> 26:55.113
Two minutes behind you.

26:55.197 --> 26:56.447
- Great.
- You'll see her to the car, please, sir?

26:56.532 --> 26:58.366
- Of course.
- Thank you.

26:59.660 --> 27:00.868
What's up?

27:00.953 --> 27:03.454
So what's with the creepy guy with the
cane? Someone I should know about?

27:03.539 --> 27:05.581
No, no, no. He's been at these meetings
longer than I have.

27:05.666 --> 27:06.833
He's fine.

27:08.127 --> 27:09.210
All right.

27:10.004 --> 27:11.921
Listen, get back to the hotel,
and get some rest, all right?

27:12.006 --> 27:14.007
Yeah. Everything's fine.

27:14.633 --> 27:15.758
Great work tonight, Bobby.

27:15.843 --> 27:17.552
- Thank you.
- You're the man.

27:31.692 --> 27:32.859
Joyce?

27:39.199 --> 27:40.533
What happened to him?

27:42.369 --> 27:45.288
They always tell you not to smoke
at the gas station.

27:45.372 --> 27:48.207
- This should wrap up the week for you.
- Great.

27:53.922 --> 27:54.922
What's up, man?

27:55.716 --> 27:57.717
I'm at a junkyard on 58th.

27:57.926 --> 27:59.010
Why?

27:59.094 --> 28:00.636
Call came in about a car crash.

28:00.721 --> 28:02.889
Car crash? Why are you there?

28:03.557 --> 28:04.766
It's not just a car crash.

28:04.850 --> 28:06.142
It's a trap.

28:06.226 --> 28:07.810
How many bodies?

28:08.562 --> 28:10.063
Enough pieces to make four.

28:10.606 --> 28:13.149
Okay, get everyone away
from that crime scene till I get there.

28:13.233 --> 28:15.068
- Even Homicide, you got it?
- Yeah.

28:15.152 --> 28:16.652
All right, I'm on the way.

28:18.947 --> 28:22.283
Hello, Evan. I want to play a game.

28:22.368 --> 28:24.911
The situation you find yourself in...

28:26.538 --> 28:28.748
You, your girlfriend...

28:31.752 --> 28:37.340
You have intimidated others
based on their physical differences.

28:54.900 --> 28:56.776
So, what do you think?

28:57.403 --> 28:58.444
Why?

28:59.071 --> 29:00.780
Why this display?

29:01.740 --> 29:03.366
Why them? Why now?

29:03.784 --> 29:05.952
You know he likes to put on a show.

29:06.578 --> 29:08.955
Well, there's gotta be something else.

29:16.964 --> 29:19.841
Bag the other bodies. Get them back
to the coroner's office right away.

29:19.925 --> 29:22.176
We'll need them checked
for anything resembling a clue.

29:22.261 --> 29:25.346
Tattoos, piercings, skin cuttings.

29:25.431 --> 29:28.599
If that man has a cavity in his tooth,
I want to know about it.

29:28.684 --> 29:29.934
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

29:30.018 --> 29:31.269
Gibson.

29:31.687 --> 29:33.146
Yeah?

29:33.522 --> 29:35.189
Hoffman was expecting you.

29:38.527 --> 29:39.986
God damn.

29:42.906 --> 29:43.990
Would you look at that?

29:45.325 --> 29:46.826
Please get forensics in here.

29:47.286 --> 29:48.995
Tell them to haul ass.

29:49.204 --> 29:51.330
This needs to be dusted for prints.

29:52.249 --> 29:53.666
- All right.
- Okay.

30:28.202 --> 30:29.327
Help!

30:47.846 --> 30:48.888
Hello, Bobby.

30:50.599 --> 30:51.891
I want to play a game.

30:52.851 --> 30:56.479
You have amassed wealth, fame,
and notoriety,

30:56.563 --> 30:59.398
based upon your story of survival.

30:59.483 --> 31:04.320
Many have aided in your cause,
but few know the truth.

31:04.404 --> 31:06.489
You are a liar.

31:06.573 --> 31:09.367
You and I both know
you have never been in a trap,

31:09.451 --> 31:11.869
nor have you ever been tested.

31:13.372 --> 31:17.625
Today these lies will come full circle
and you will learn

31:18.085 --> 31:22.672
if you truly have what it takes
to call yourself a survivor.

31:23.674 --> 31:25.508
The cage you find yourself in

31:25.592 --> 31:27.677
will symbolize your rebirth.

31:30.472 --> 31:31.847
Joyce? No!

31:33.433 --> 31:36.102
Joyce! No!

31:36.186 --> 31:37.562
Please, no.

31:38.272 --> 31:40.022
Within the next 60 minutes,

31:40.107 --> 31:43.150
you must stay upon the path of learning

31:43.235 --> 31:45.695
and traverse a series of obstacles

31:45.779 --> 31:47.947
to obtain access to your wife,

31:48.031 --> 31:49.991
who you have also deceived.

31:50.200 --> 31:53.160
If you fail to reach her
before the clock runs out,

31:53.620 --> 31:54.996
- she will die.
- No.

31:55.289 --> 31:56.664
Live or die, Bobby?

31:56.748 --> 31:58.124
Make your choice.

33:11.657 --> 33:12.823
Bobby!

33:14.159 --> 33:18.079
Help!

33:19.539 --> 33:21.415
Let me out!

33:31.510 --> 33:32.635
Bobby.

33:32.719 --> 33:36.972
Bobby! What's going on? What's going on?

33:37.724 --> 33:40.351
Another Jigsaw survivor has come forward.

33:41.311 --> 33:43.979
As the city stays crippled in fear
from the Jigsaw killings,

33:44.481 --> 33:47.692
chilling new words from
the latest survivor provide a reminder

33:47.776 --> 33:51.362
of the physical and mental toll
these deadly games can take.

33:52.364 --> 33:56.075
This horrible event was happening to me,

33:56.410 --> 33:59.328
and in that moment,

34:00.414 --> 34:02.540
that moment that this thing

34:03.250 --> 34:05.584
threatened to take everything away,

34:06.169 --> 34:07.753
even the pain,

34:10.005 --> 34:13.134
I realized what I still had left to give.

34:14.177 --> 34:16.219
And I didn't want to let that go.

34:18.264 --> 34:19.931
It gave me light.

34:21.643 --> 34:25.813
That pure moment
of absolute horror gave me light.

34:25.897 --> 34:28.274
And as wrong as this may seem,

34:29.568 --> 34:31.610
I'm better for enduring it.

34:32.696 --> 34:34.405
I'm stronger.

34:35.072 --> 34:37.658
And, I must admit, I'm grateful for it.

34:38.659 --> 34:40.911
I'm grateful it happened to me,

34:41.955 --> 34:44.331
and I wish the same for everyone like me.

34:45.250 --> 34:47.626
Joan is but one of a growing
number of citizens...

34:47.710 --> 34:51.797
If something like that doesn't get you
to change your perspective on life,

34:52.507 --> 34:54.175
I don't know what will.

34:55.469 --> 34:56.594
Yeah.

34:58.680 --> 35:01.223
And if those people weren't so fucked up
after their games,

35:01.308 --> 35:03.934
they'd make a mint selling their stories.

36:09.543 --> 36:12.711
That's a real clever design.

36:14.422 --> 36:16.215
Yours or your husband's?

36:16.716 --> 36:18.050
- Everything was him.
- Right.

36:18.134 --> 36:19.385
Well, here's my problem,

36:19.469 --> 36:23.055
that was left for me,
and your fingerprints were all over it.

36:24.391 --> 36:26.058
When you told me Hoffman had it in for you,

36:26.142 --> 36:28.978
you didn't mention that
it was because you tried to kill him.

36:31.940 --> 36:33.899
There's a new game going on.

36:34.401 --> 36:35.568
Does that surprise you?

36:36.611 --> 36:39.363
- No.
- No? No?

36:40.532 --> 36:42.783
You're crazy, you know that?

36:43.535 --> 36:45.828
I knew you were crazy
the minute I laid eyes on you.

36:45.912 --> 36:47.079
Crazy.

36:48.248 --> 36:52.251
Okay, this is what we're gonna do, crazy.

36:53.169 --> 36:55.963
Till I catch Mark Hoffman,
this is your new home.

36:56.756 --> 36:57.756
Get comfy.

36:58.717 --> 37:00.467
What makes you think he can't find me here?

37:00.552 --> 37:02.636
Jill, it's a safe house.

37:03.179 --> 37:05.264
Safe house. Safe. House.

37:05.849 --> 37:07.141
You get it?

37:10.353 --> 37:14.481
Gibson, this was sent here addressed to Jill.

37:14.566 --> 37:18.235
- Hoffman knows our location.
- God damn it. God damn it!

37:19.195 --> 37:20.195
What?

37:21.031 --> 37:23.782
We just had a small explosion here in a car
at the crime scene.

37:23.867 --> 37:24.992
Okay, is anyone hurt?

37:25.076 --> 37:26.452
Holy shit!

37:34.961 --> 37:35.961
Rogers?

37:36.046 --> 37:37.379
Rogers, you okay?

37:37.464 --> 37:38.422
Yeah.

37:38.506 --> 37:40.424
Get out of there.
You get the bomb squad to sweep the yard.

37:40.508 --> 37:42.801
Don't touch anything else until it's clean.

37:43.803 --> 37:45.304
- Got it.
- All right.

37:46.765 --> 37:47.932
Play it.

37:54.147 --> 37:55.272
Hello, Gibson.

37:56.274 --> 37:57.608
Been a long time.

37:58.109 --> 37:59.652
What I want is simple,

37:59.736 --> 38:01.153
give me Jill Tuck.

38:01.738 --> 38:03.489
You're protecting her despite the fact

38:03.573 --> 38:05.157
that she had direct knowledge throughout,

38:06.284 --> 38:09.161
which makes her complicit in every death.

38:10.121 --> 38:11.747
I'll make you a deal.

38:11.831 --> 38:13.332
Give her to me,

38:14.542 --> 38:16.335
the game stops, and no one else dies.

38:17.504 --> 38:21.006
If not, everyone dies and you'll be to blame.

38:22.175 --> 38:24.093
Make your choice.

38:24.177 --> 38:25.678
The clock is ticking.

38:28.640 --> 38:30.641
Let's get her down to the holding cell
at the station.

38:31.101 --> 38:33.602
Lock it down.
No one gets in without my authority.

38:33.687 --> 38:34.853
Got it.

38:53.581 --> 38:54.707
Oh, my God.

38:56.167 --> 38:57.167
Oh, God!

38:57.252 --> 38:58.585
No! Please!

38:59.754 --> 39:02.506
No! Please, help! Please!

39:02.716 --> 39:04.133
Please, no!

39:04.217 --> 39:05.551
God damn it!

39:06.553 --> 39:08.637
Bobby. Bobby, help me!

39:08.722 --> 39:10.681
You've got to get me out of here.

39:11.725 --> 39:13.600
I can't move, Bobby.

39:13.977 --> 39:15.227
Please, help me!

39:15.311 --> 39:17.229
Okay, okay, okay. Just relax.

39:22.652 --> 39:24.987
Help me! Do something!

39:27.157 --> 39:28.574
Don't leave me.

39:30.368 --> 39:31.660
Hello, Bobby.

39:31.745 --> 39:34.872
Before you
is one of your trusted colleagues.

39:34.956 --> 39:39.710
She has been your publicist for years,
knowing your lies

39:39.794 --> 39:42.212
but choosing to speak no evil.

39:42.297 --> 39:45.340
She has been richly rewarded for her words,

39:45.425 --> 39:49.428
but today she will be rewarded
for her silence.

39:49.971 --> 39:52.347
In the X-ray, you will see a key,

39:52.432 --> 39:57.269
the key to Nina's survival,
which will shut off her device.

39:57.604 --> 39:58.854
But there's a catch.

39:58.938 --> 40:01.982
You have one minute
to pull the fish hook from her stomach,

40:02.067 --> 40:03.609
and unlock her device

40:05.195 --> 40:08.155
or else the four spikes
will penetrate her throat,

40:08.239 --> 40:10.908
- silencing Nina forever.
- Fuck!

40:10.992 --> 40:13.243
Remember, the spikes will also advance

40:13.328 --> 40:18.332
each time the decibel level in this room
rises above a whisper,

40:18.416 --> 40:20.292
killing her even sooner.

40:20.710 --> 40:24.463
Will Nina live or die, Bobby?
The choice is yours.

40:26.424 --> 40:29.551
- Help me. Help!
- No! No!

40:33.640 --> 40:34.807
Just shut up.

40:36.351 --> 40:37.935
Stay with me, okay?

40:43.900 --> 40:45.025
Do it.

40:52.450 --> 40:54.493
No. No. No.

40:55.662 --> 40:57.788
Okay, stay with me. Stay with me.

40:57.872 --> 40:59.456
It's gonna be okay. Look at me.

40:59.541 --> 41:00.582
Look at me.

41:13.471 --> 41:15.931
No! Nina, quiet. Nina.

41:16.015 --> 41:17.599
Please. Please, for me.

41:17.684 --> 41:19.309
Just shut the fuck up.

41:19.394 --> 41:21.562
I'm gonna get this out.

41:35.535 --> 41:37.077
No! No!

41:37.912 --> 41:41.081
Just do it, Bobby. Just fucking do it.

42:08.651 --> 42:09.651
Bobby!

42:27.754 --> 42:29.087
No!

42:31.466 --> 42:33.759
Why wouldn't you just shut the fuck up?

42:35.678 --> 42:37.638
You just needed to shut up!

42:41.351 --> 42:44.269
No! Oh, my God!

42:44.938 --> 42:47.773
No! Help!

42:51.611 --> 42:54.029
Help! Help!

43:26.354 --> 43:28.355
Here you are, ma'am. Take care.

43:30.024 --> 43:31.650
Ma'am, your name?

43:31.734 --> 43:34.486
Sara, without an "H."

43:35.989 --> 43:38.657
I just want to say I love your book so much.

43:39.158 --> 43:41.994
I just felt like I could feel everything
that you went through.

43:42.620 --> 43:44.288
I feel like it changed my life.

43:44.539 --> 43:46.206
I appreciate that, ma'am.

43:47.375 --> 43:49.835
I really do. Thank you.

43:51.170 --> 43:52.838
Thank you.

44:00.680 --> 44:02.097
Your name, sir?

44:02.181 --> 44:03.181
John.

44:04.517 --> 44:07.269
With an "H," without an "H,"
it doesn't matter.

44:07.353 --> 44:09.813
We'll go with John with an "H" this time.

44:09.897 --> 44:12.524
You got quite an army working for you here,
don't you?

44:13.401 --> 44:15.110
Must be spreading a pretty good word.

44:15.194 --> 44:18.488
Well, we try to reach as many
people as possible, you know?

44:18.573 --> 44:20.782
You don't see anything wrong with that?

44:21.200 --> 44:23.493
No. No, sir, I don't.

44:27.373 --> 44:28.623
You know,

44:30.001 --> 44:31.710
history is a passion for me.

44:32.211 --> 44:34.963
And in ancient Egypt
if you were speaking under oath,

44:35.048 --> 44:36.465
you were required to say,

44:36.549 --> 44:41.470
"If I'm lying, take me to the quarries."

44:43.848 --> 44:45.807
That mean anything to you?

44:45.892 --> 44:48.310
No, sir. No, sir, it doesn't.

44:48.895 --> 44:50.771
Well, I'll tell you what it means.

44:50.855 --> 44:54.399
It means if you knowingly lied
on the public record

44:55.860 --> 44:57.819
that you were subject
to a period of enslavement.

44:57.904 --> 44:59.738
What are you implying here, sir?

44:59.822 --> 45:01.406
I'm not implying anything.

45:01.991 --> 45:04.242
Move along, buddy. He signed your book.

45:05.953 --> 45:07.704
Thanks for the signature.

45:08.664 --> 45:11.208
Nice picture, but I don't need it.

45:12.251 --> 45:13.585
We've met.

45:26.808 --> 45:28.975
Adam, Gibson says he wants
you on these right away.

45:29.060 --> 45:30.268
They're from the junkyard.

45:35.566 --> 45:37.442
Make your choice.

45:37.902 --> 45:39.361
The clock is ticking.

45:40.238 --> 45:41.238
See that?

45:42.365 --> 45:43.365
Yeah.

45:44.617 --> 45:46.451
I know that from somewhere.

45:47.370 --> 45:50.080
Hey, I've got something over here.

45:51.833 --> 45:54.709
We might know who's in the game.
This was just sent to us.

45:54.794 --> 45:57.796
It was taken
from a security camera downtown.

45:57.880 --> 45:59.548
The guy's name is Bobby Dagen.

45:59.632 --> 46:00.799
- Familiar?
- No.

46:00.883 --> 46:04.261
He's a Jigsaw survivor
who's milking it on talk shows.

46:04.679 --> 46:07.305
His wife and handlers are also missing.

46:35.877 --> 46:37.085
Joyce?

46:38.629 --> 46:40.297
Who is it? Who's there?

46:41.007 --> 46:42.340
- Suzanne.
- Who is that?

46:42.425 --> 46:44.342
For fuck's sake, Bobby. Bobby.

46:44.844 --> 46:46.094
Bobby, get me out of here.

46:46.179 --> 46:47.429
Bobby, help me.

46:47.513 --> 46:49.598
- Is Cale here?
- Who the fuck knows?

46:49.682 --> 46:52.851
Get this off of me, Bobby! Get this off of me!

46:58.399 --> 46:59.483
Hello, Bobby.

46:59.567 --> 47:03.612
That feeling running
through your body is fear,

47:03.696 --> 47:07.699
the fear of not knowing
if you have what it takes to survive.

47:07.783 --> 47:09.659
Before you is your lawyer

47:09.744 --> 47:11.286
who swore an oath of ethics,

47:11.370 --> 47:16.333
but chose to see no evil
in order to benefit herself.

47:16.417 --> 47:18.460
Once her device begins to rotate,

47:18.544 --> 47:20.879
it will pierce her eyes and mouth

47:20.963 --> 47:24.841
if you don't delay its movement
for at least 30 seconds.

47:24.926 --> 47:25.967
To do this,

47:26.052 --> 47:31.014
you must step into the other machine
and lift the bars to the highest position

47:31.098 --> 47:35.685
long enough to close the circuit,
slowing down her device.

47:35.770 --> 47:38.855
If you do nothing, she will wind to her death

47:38.940 --> 47:40.440
before the clock runs out.

47:40.816 --> 47:43.068
Do you have what it takes to help her?

47:43.402 --> 47:44.486
Make your choice.

47:45.071 --> 47:46.363
Bobby, please!

47:46.447 --> 47:48.240
Bobby, please get me out!

47:48.574 --> 47:49.741
Get me the fuck...

47:51.244 --> 47:52.285
Oh, God!

47:53.663 --> 47:55.747
No, no! Bobby, please!

47:57.291 --> 47:58.667
Please, help me!

48:00.711 --> 48:03.213
Oh, God! Oh, God!

48:03.297 --> 48:05.465
Please, hurry! Hurry!

48:06.008 --> 48:09.261
Come on, Bobby, please! Hurry!

48:09.345 --> 48:11.513
Come on! Bobby, come on!

48:11.764 --> 48:15.433
Hurry! Please! Please, hurry!

48:21.857 --> 48:23.567
Bobby, please, hurry!

48:23.651 --> 48:24.693
Hurry!

48:30.283 --> 48:33.326
Yes! Yes, Bobby! Yes!

48:34.954 --> 48:36.162
Come on!

48:37.206 --> 48:38.540
Bobby, no.

48:46.382 --> 48:49.634
No! God, no!

48:49.719 --> 48:51.553
No! Bobby!

48:51.637 --> 48:54.514
Please, no! Bobby, no!

48:55.224 --> 48:57.934
Come on, Bobby. Please!
Get me out of here!

48:58.519 --> 48:59.644
Come on!

49:00.771 --> 49:02.147
Bobby, please!

49:02.315 --> 49:03.315
No!

49:03.608 --> 49:04.649
Oh, God.

49:04.942 --> 49:07.360
Oh, my God. Bobby, stay there.

49:11.907 --> 49:13.825
Bobby, please, no!

49:14.118 --> 49:15.827
No! No!

49:20.583 --> 49:21.625
No!

49:24.879 --> 49:26.671
Please, please!

49:26.964 --> 49:27.922
No!

49:28.007 --> 49:29.341
Oh, God!

50:14.261 --> 50:15.345
Oh, my God.

50:18.432 --> 50:20.350
No. No.

50:21.560 --> 50:22.644
Help!

50:35.783 --> 50:37.492
Do you know this guy?

50:42.623 --> 50:44.040
I've seen him on TV, but I don't know him.

50:46.669 --> 50:47.669
Did your husband?

50:47.962 --> 50:49.254
I don't know.

50:50.965 --> 50:53.091
You sure you don't know him?

50:55.177 --> 50:56.428
Yeah, I'm sure.

50:57.430 --> 50:58.805
All right then.

51:02.685 --> 51:04.060
Lock it up.

51:04.812 --> 51:07.772
Hoffman just sent an e-mail
with an MPEG attachment.

51:07.857 --> 51:10.150
I'm just searching the IP address.

51:10.234 --> 51:11.776
Can you find out where it came from?

51:11.861 --> 51:15.530
It depends on how many proxy servers
he filtered it through,

51:15.614 --> 51:18.241
but it was time-delayed,
so it'll leave fingerprints.

51:18.325 --> 51:19.367
Play it.

51:20.953 --> 51:22.203
Hello, Gibson.

51:22.621 --> 51:25.248
Once again, we're at a moral crossroad.

51:26.167 --> 51:28.543
I don't blame you
for not giving me Jill Tuck,

51:28.919 --> 51:31.171
but you shouldn't let an old grudge
cloud yourjudgment.

51:32.798 --> 51:34.632
Look to where you're being led.

51:35.217 --> 51:37.302
Look beyond the crossroad
to the clear dawn.

51:39.305 --> 51:40.638
Do you see it?

51:44.643 --> 51:46.311
I get it. Let's go.

52:05.122 --> 52:06.164
Joyce?

52:24.975 --> 52:25.934
Cale?

52:26.018 --> 52:27.477
Bobby? Bobby?

52:27.853 --> 52:30.313
Listen to me. Cale.
Cale, I can see you, okay?

52:30.648 --> 52:32.899
- Cale, don't move.
- Bobby, where the hell are you?

52:33.192 --> 52:35.109
- You got to help me, Bobby.
- Do you know where Joyce is?

52:35.194 --> 52:36.611
What the fuck? I can't see, man.

52:36.695 --> 52:37.904
How the fuck would I know where Joyce is?

52:37.988 --> 52:39.113
I'm about to lose my shit!

52:39.198 --> 52:41.074
Do I know where Joyce is?
I'm fucking blind, man.

52:41.158 --> 52:43.201
Okay, Cale. Cale, do not move.

52:43.702 --> 52:45.703
I got this thing around my fucking neck.
I can't fucking breathe.

52:45.788 --> 52:48.039
Don't fucking move.
We're not on the ground floor.

52:48.123 --> 52:49.374
A lot of this floor is missing.

52:49.458 --> 52:51.417
Just don't move, okay?

52:51.752 --> 52:53.503
Fuck. You gotta help me.

52:54.046 --> 52:57.924
Get me fucking down, Bobby! Fuck!
Fuck me!

52:58.008 --> 52:59.259
Cale, there's a tape.

52:59.343 --> 53:01.928
- What fucking tape?
- There's a tape.

53:02.012 --> 53:03.596
Shut up. I'm gonna play the tape.

53:07.268 --> 53:11.855
Hello, Bobby.
Across from you is your closest friend.

53:11.939 --> 53:17.652
He knows all your sins,
yet he acts as though he hears no evil.

53:17.736 --> 53:19.821
Today, what he hears

53:19.905 --> 53:23.324
will be the difference
between life and death.

53:23.409 --> 53:26.661
Bobby, you must help
Cale walk over the planks,

53:26.745 --> 53:28.997
and get as close to you as possible.

53:29.582 --> 53:32.959
Find your own way across
the beams to the key.

53:33.544 --> 53:37.171
You must get it to him over
the last span between you.

53:37.256 --> 53:41.843
If the noose around Cale's neck
is not removed within 60 seconds,

53:41.927 --> 53:46.431
a winch will be engaged,
and your secret will be left hanging.

53:46.682 --> 53:50.393
Does Cale live or die, Bobby?
The choice is yours.

53:50.477 --> 53:51.769
Bobby!

53:51.854 --> 53:52.937
Oh, God.

53:53.397 --> 53:55.940
Cale. Cale, listen to me.

53:56.233 --> 53:57.358
Listen to me.

53:57.443 --> 53:59.527
Shut the fuck up
and you listen to me for once.

54:00.070 --> 54:02.530
Listen, I'm gonna walk you through this,
okay, buddy?

54:02.615 --> 54:04.198
I'm blind. You fucking come to me.

54:04.283 --> 54:06.284
I'm gonna try to get as close to you
as I can, buddy.

54:06.368 --> 54:08.536
I'm fucking listening to you.
Talk me fucking through this.

54:08.621 --> 54:10.955
I want you to shuffle to your right.

54:11.123 --> 54:13.124
Just shuffle exactly to your right.

54:13.918 --> 54:16.294
You're gonna feel a plank at your foot.
Yes, yes.

54:16.378 --> 54:19.339
Yes, yes, perfect.
I need you to head out on that plank.

54:19.423 --> 54:20.465
- Oh, fuck.
- Yes.

54:21.675 --> 54:23.509
Okay, I got it. I got it. I got it!

54:25.638 --> 54:27.096
Fuck this.

54:27.431 --> 54:29.098
Okay, Cale, I'm on the way.

54:29.725 --> 54:31.976
Fuck. Fuck. Okay, all right.

54:32.186 --> 54:34.312
Now there's gonna be a plank
in front of you.

54:34.563 --> 54:36.022
- Okay.
- You're gonna have to go

54:36.106 --> 54:37.649
about 10 degrees to your right.

54:37.733 --> 54:39.192
I got it. I got it.

54:39.276 --> 54:41.569
- Come on, keep fucking talking to me.
- Okay. Okay, Cale.

54:42.321 --> 54:44.197
- Feel where the plank...
- I got it.

54:44.740 --> 54:45.740
Okay.

54:46.241 --> 54:48.826
Oh, God! What the fuck was that, man?

54:48.911 --> 54:51.454
It's okay, Cale. It was a bottle.
It was a bottle.

54:51.538 --> 54:54.248
- What the fuck was that?
- It's okay. It was a bottle.

54:54.333 --> 54:56.834
- You're gonna be fine.
- Okay.

54:57.419 --> 54:59.462
Fuck. Okay.

54:59.546 --> 55:00.755
You got it, buddy.

55:01.173 --> 55:03.925
You got it.
Now you're gonna feel a second plank.

55:04.009 --> 55:07.178
- You'll feel it with your foot.
- I got it.

55:07.388 --> 55:08.388
Feel it with your foot.

55:11.684 --> 55:13.142
Get me out of this fucking thing, Bobby.

55:13.227 --> 55:14.727
Step up onto the plank.

55:17.690 --> 55:19.023
Oh, fuck. Oh, God.

55:19.483 --> 55:21.150
Relax. You're okay.

55:24.822 --> 55:26.531
No! No!

55:27.199 --> 55:28.700
Cale, hang on. Cale.

55:32.079 --> 55:39.377
Fuck. Fuck.

55:53.225 --> 55:54.559
Bobby. Bobby.

56:06.280 --> 56:07.947
I got the key but... Cale!

56:09.116 --> 56:10.116
I'm gonna throw you the key.

56:10.200 --> 56:12.368
Cup your hands closer to your chest!

56:12.453 --> 56:14.454
I'm gonna throw it on three, all right?

56:16.999 --> 56:18.458
One,

56:18.792 --> 56:20.251
two,

56:20.335 --> 56:21.335
three.

56:27.843 --> 56:28.885
No.

56:31.430 --> 56:32.889
Oh, fuck me.

56:37.436 --> 56:39.437
No! God damn it, no!

56:42.274 --> 56:43.441
Cale!

56:50.949 --> 56:53.201
No. Cale.

57:06.632 --> 57:07.715
There's nothing here.

57:07.800 --> 57:09.300
Yes, there is.

57:10.010 --> 57:11.427
Right there.

57:16.809 --> 57:18.559
Why would he want us to come here?

57:18.644 --> 57:20.812
For me to remember.

57:20.896 --> 57:23.356
This is where he saved my life.

57:24.608 --> 57:28.236
When I was in uniform
I responded to a distress call here.

57:28.737 --> 57:32.657
Back when this place was a flophouse
forjunkies and homeless people.

57:50.551 --> 57:52.802
Freeze! Don't you fucking move.

57:54.888 --> 57:56.347
Drop the gun.

58:06.233 --> 58:07.275
He didn't know what hit him.

58:08.569 --> 58:13.531
Yeah, he assaulted me,
but it shouldn't have been a death sentence.

58:20.539 --> 58:22.915
Next time, you shoot first.

58:25.586 --> 58:28.504
I had no choice
but to report Hoffman for brutality.

58:28.589 --> 58:29.755
You owe me.

58:34.720 --> 58:35.720
What happened?

58:38.182 --> 58:42.435
He got a promotion is what happened.
And I got put on an island.

58:43.353 --> 58:46.022
A year later, I transferred to IA,
busted three of his guys.

58:46.106 --> 58:49.734
He swore he'd get me back, and here we are.

58:50.402 --> 58:54.906
This place was called
Crossroads Manufacturing before it closed.

58:56.783 --> 58:58.993
"Look beyond the crossroads

59:00.829 --> 59:02.580
"to the clear dawn."

59:03.290 --> 59:04.832
I don't follow you.

59:04.917 --> 59:08.544
The man he killed was released from
Clear Dawn Psychiatric Hospital

59:08.629 --> 59:10.463
when the state shut it down.

59:10.714 --> 59:12.256
That building's been abandoned for years.

59:13.508 --> 59:15.343
That's where the game is being played.

59:15.427 --> 59:18.179
All right, you get back,
you stay with Jill Tuck.

59:18.263 --> 59:20.598
Don't let her out of your sight.

59:39.076 --> 59:40.076
Bobby!

59:42.287 --> 59:44.705
- Joyce?
- Bobby. Bobby!

59:45.749 --> 59:47.250
Bobby, I'm here.

59:48.168 --> 59:50.127
- Joyce.
- Bobby, can you hear me?

59:50.212 --> 59:52.046
Joyce, I can hear you. I can see you.

59:52.130 --> 59:53.798
Bobby, I can see you, too.

59:54.466 --> 59:56.050
Yes, baby.

59:56.677 --> 59:59.303
- Get me out of here.
- Baby, I'm on my way.

59:59.805 --> 01:00:01.555
Who's doing this? Why?

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:04.350
- Why is this happening?
- Please, baby, I'm on the way.

01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:07.853
- Just hang on, okay?
- Hurry. Please hurry.

01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:10.648
There's got to be a tape.

01:00:11.692 --> 01:00:12.692
Hello, Bobby.

01:00:13.694 --> 01:00:16.570
Before you is the door
that leads to your wife.

01:00:16.655 --> 01:00:19.991
However, you must first make a choice.

01:00:20.075 --> 01:00:24.662
As you may have guessed, your decision
will be as difficult as pulling teeth.

01:00:26.290 --> 01:00:30.626
The lock before you requires
a four-digit combination to open.

01:00:30.711 --> 01:00:33.796
However, if it is access you seek

01:00:34.631 --> 01:00:37.383
then a true sacrifice will have to be made.

01:00:39.011 --> 01:00:40.678
Watch and learn, Bobby.

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:49.520
The necessary numbers have been etched
onto two of your teeth.

01:00:51.231 --> 01:00:54.734
Look to the chart as a reference
for which teeth to pull

01:00:54.818 --> 01:00:57.737
and in which order to enter the digits.

01:00:59.239 --> 01:01:01.115
Time is ticking down.

01:01:01.533 --> 01:01:03.159
You must make your decision quickly.

01:01:08.165 --> 01:01:09.332
Bobby!

01:01:10.542 --> 01:01:13.627
I don't want you to see this, baby, okay?

01:01:13.712 --> 01:01:15.129
Oh, my God.

01:01:18.008 --> 01:01:19.258
No.

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:22.762
No!

01:01:24.056 --> 01:01:25.389
Left side clear.

01:01:26.683 --> 01:01:27.683
Clear.

01:01:29.227 --> 01:01:30.227
- Clear.
- Clear.

01:01:30.812 --> 01:01:31.812
Change your position.

01:01:33.732 --> 01:01:35.149
The game's still on.

01:01:45.494 --> 01:01:47.411
- Let's go.
- Move to the second level.

01:01:55.087 --> 01:01:56.420
- Clear.
- Clear.

01:01:57.756 --> 01:01:58.923
Clear.

01:01:59.257 --> 01:02:00.299
Go.

01:02:16.191 --> 01:02:18.109
- Clear up.
- All clear.

01:02:18.276 --> 01:02:19.402
Move, move.

01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:23.447
- Moving in.
- Moving in.

01:02:23.782 --> 01:02:25.533
- Clear.
- We're clear.

01:02:33.458 --> 01:02:35.126
Block it off.

01:02:36.378 --> 01:02:38.462
- What?
- I found where that MPEG came from.

01:02:38.547 --> 01:02:40.714
- Where?
- A business called Pete's Auto Body

01:02:40.799 --> 01:02:42.091
on 58th Street.

01:02:42.175 --> 01:02:44.718
- The junkyard.
- The location of the car trap?

01:02:44.803 --> 01:02:46.303
Yeah, that's correct.

01:02:48.974 --> 01:02:50.266
Okay, you guys keep moving.

01:02:50.350 --> 01:02:51.725
Where are you going?

01:02:52.227 --> 01:02:53.227
To get Hoffman.

01:02:53.311 --> 01:02:55.187
Okay, let's move it.

01:03:01.987 --> 01:03:03.154
Rogers.

01:03:07.826 --> 01:03:08.909
Yeah.

01:03:09.619 --> 01:03:12.037
What? What happened?

01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:14.999
Gibson's got Hoffman's location.

01:03:16.877 --> 01:03:18.419
The game isn't over.

01:03:32.684 --> 01:03:34.143
Another body.

01:03:36.855 --> 01:03:37.938
Hold.

01:03:41.985 --> 01:03:43.152
We got a live one.

01:03:59.503 --> 01:04:02.338
Can't cross here. Let's go.

01:04:48.093 --> 01:04:50.469
Hey. Go get your shotguns.
You come follow me.

01:05:08.446 --> 01:05:09.446
Give me your gun.

01:05:31.553 --> 01:05:33.721
Hoffman, freeze.

01:05:33.805 --> 01:05:36.348
I want you to slowly put your hands
in the air.

01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:46.400
Joyce.

01:05:46.484 --> 01:05:47.484
Bobby.

01:05:48.111 --> 01:05:50.195
Bobby, I knew you'd make it.

01:05:51.823 --> 01:05:52.948
I knew you'd find me.

01:05:53.033 --> 01:05:54.283
I am so sorry.

01:05:54.367 --> 01:05:55.993
I knew you could do it.

01:05:56.661 --> 01:05:57.995
I knew you'd come.

01:05:58.330 --> 01:05:59.330
Get me out.

01:06:03.418 --> 01:06:04.668
Bobby. Oh, my God.

01:06:05.587 --> 01:06:07.004
There's gotta be another way.

01:06:11.343 --> 01:06:15.179
Hello, Bobby.
You have almost completed your rebirth.

01:06:15.263 --> 01:06:19.642
However, your final task
will be your most difficult.

01:06:19.726 --> 01:06:23.145
The woman before you
symbolizes your success.

01:06:23.229 --> 01:06:24.688
She is your trophy.

01:06:24.773 --> 01:06:27.441
And she has seen the good
in your message,

01:06:27.525 --> 01:06:29.693
despite its dishonest beginnings.

01:06:29.778 --> 01:06:31.195
What's he talking about?

01:06:31.279 --> 01:06:35.407
Today, we will see
if you can truly earn her love.

01:06:37.118 --> 01:06:39.578
To prove your status as a survivor,

01:06:39.663 --> 01:06:44.041
you must overcome a game
that should be all too familiar.

01:06:45.085 --> 01:06:47.586
- No.
- You supposedly survived it once already,

01:06:47.671 --> 01:06:51.590
so it should be easy to survive once again.

01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:54.802
Pierce the hooks
through your chest muscles,

01:06:54.886 --> 01:06:56.387
and the game will begin.

01:06:56.471 --> 01:07:01.517
In order to free yourself and your wife,
you must hoist yourself with these chains,

01:07:02.352 --> 01:07:07.481
and connect the extension cords above you
before the clock expires.

01:07:10.652 --> 01:07:13.612
Both hands will be needed
to complete this task.

01:07:13.697 --> 01:07:15.572
But that should be simple.

01:07:15.657 --> 01:07:18.450
For, as you claim to understand,

01:07:18.827 --> 01:07:22.121
the pectoral muscles
can easily support your weight.

01:07:22.664 --> 01:07:23.956
So I ask you, Bobby,

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:27.292
when you embrace every day
as if it is your last,

01:07:27.877 --> 01:07:29.920
will it be with your wife?

01:07:30.922 --> 01:07:32.548
Make your choice.

01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:35.467
What's he talking about?

01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:37.302
Baby, I'm so sorry.

01:07:39.848 --> 01:07:40.848
I lied.

01:07:43.143 --> 01:07:44.852
I was never in a trap.

01:07:51.067 --> 01:07:52.234
Clear.

01:08:16.593 --> 01:08:18.635
How could you let me believe that?

01:08:19.136 --> 01:08:20.970
I'm gonna make this right.

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:23.890
You don't deserve to be there.

01:08:26.644 --> 01:08:28.060
I'm your wife.

01:08:28.772 --> 01:08:30.647
How could you lie to me?

01:08:40.116 --> 01:08:41.366
I know that from somewhere.

01:08:42.702 --> 01:08:44.828
Make your choice. Clock's ticking.

01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:58.425
Bag the other bodies. Get them back
to the coroner's office right away.

01:09:00.553 --> 01:09:01.678
What is this, sir?

01:09:01.763 --> 01:09:05.432
Hoffman tapped
into the station's security system.

01:09:05.517 --> 01:09:07.350
He's been watching us the whole time.

01:09:36.923 --> 01:09:38.549
Oh, my God.

01:09:45.055 --> 01:09:46.223
- This is Palmer.
- Listen.

01:09:46.307 --> 01:09:48.392
You get every available officer
back to the station.

01:09:48.475 --> 01:09:49.475
I'm sorry, sir?

01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:50.894
Right now.

01:09:52.229 --> 01:09:53.272
Sir.

01:10:10.415 --> 01:10:13.458
Gibson, are you still there? Gibson.

01:11:06.346 --> 01:11:07.930
- Door's locked!
- We're locked in!

01:11:11.392 --> 01:11:12.434
Gas! Gas!

01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:13.852
Look for an exit.

01:11:35.333 --> 01:11:36.833
I love you, Joyce.

01:11:38.836 --> 01:11:40.671
I never lied about that.

01:11:41.047 --> 01:11:43.632
I love you. I love you.

01:11:43.716 --> 01:11:45.384
Bobby, I love you.

01:11:50.723 --> 01:11:52.516
No! Oh, my God.

01:11:54.560 --> 01:12:02.109
No.

01:12:07.991 --> 01:12:09.199
Gibson.

01:12:22.714 --> 01:12:24.631
You can do it. You can do it.

01:12:29.929 --> 01:12:30.929
Oh, my God.

01:12:37.186 --> 01:12:38.812
Bobby, I love you.

01:12:55.079 --> 01:12:56.413
You can do it.

01:13:00.209 --> 01:13:02.419
Hang on. Hang on. Hang on.

01:13:03.838 --> 01:13:06.256
Pull. Pull, Bobby. I know you can do it.

01:13:06.924 --> 01:13:08.008
Pull.

01:13:09.761 --> 01:13:11.553
Oh, my God. Keep going.

01:13:11.637 --> 01:13:14.514
Bobby, you can do it. Oh, my God.

01:13:14.599 --> 01:13:15.766
Bobby!

01:13:16.934 --> 01:13:18.101
Pull!

01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:43.460
What was that?

01:13:43.795 --> 01:13:46.129
That's it, pull. Pull!

01:13:48.132 --> 01:13:49.257
Pull.

01:13:51.636 --> 01:13:52.803
Hurry!

01:13:55.139 --> 01:13:56.223
Pull. You're almost there.

01:14:01.104 --> 01:14:02.521
Fight, Bobby. You can do it.

01:14:04.398 --> 01:14:05.565
Someone's out there.

01:14:13.866 --> 01:14:15.492
Oh, my God. No!

01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:17.953
Help me! Help me!

01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:21.581
Help me! No!

01:14:31.008 --> 01:14:32.217
I've been looking for you.

01:14:54.991 --> 01:14:56.032
How do I look?

01:15:03.749 --> 01:15:04.916
Bitch.

01:15:07.295 --> 01:15:08.879
Help me!

01:15:12.550 --> 01:15:14.217
Bobby, please, reach.

01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:16.720
Go.

01:15:18.055 --> 01:15:19.389
Bobby, reach.

01:15:20.641 --> 01:15:21.641
Hurry.

01:15:22.059 --> 01:15:23.810
Reach. Reach!

01:15:23.895 --> 01:15:25.395
You can do it, Bobby.

01:15:39.243 --> 01:15:40.493
Bobby, reach. Reach.

01:15:42.246 --> 01:15:45.415
One more. Reach. You can do it. Bobby!

01:15:45.499 --> 01:15:47.000
Bobby, you can do it.

01:15:54.467 --> 01:15:55.467
Bobby!

01:16:59.991 --> 01:17:00.991
No!

01:17:03.202 --> 01:17:04.494
Bobby!

01:17:08.916 --> 01:17:11.001
No. Bobby!

01:17:12.586 --> 01:17:13.753
Joyce!

01:17:17.341 --> 01:17:18.508
Bobby!

01:17:19.885 --> 01:17:20.927
Joyce!

01:17:21.012 --> 01:17:22.429
Bobby! Bobby!

01:17:27.184 --> 01:17:29.686
Joyce! Joyce!

01:17:32.982 --> 01:17:34.107
Bobby!

01:17:46.829 --> 01:17:50.623
You fucking cunt.

01:17:56.756 --> 01:17:58.256
No! Bobby!

01:18:05.139 --> 01:18:06.222
Joyce!

01:18:08.392 --> 01:18:09.392
No!

01:18:21.405 --> 01:18:22.572
Bobby!

01:18:33.709 --> 01:18:34.959
Joyce!

01:19:58.669 --> 01:20:00.003
Game over.

01:20:17.813 --> 01:20:19.105
Over the last two hours,

01:20:19.190 --> 01:20:22.400
it seems our entire city
has been shaken to its core.

01:20:22.485 --> 01:20:25.278
In addition to the nine police
employees killed tonight,

01:20:25.362 --> 01:20:28.865
Jill Tuck, the wife of serial killer
John Kramer, has been found dead.

01:20:29.241 --> 01:20:32.327
Citizens are being advised
to report any activity,

01:20:32.411 --> 01:20:34.787
even remotely suspicious, at this time,

01:20:34.872 --> 01:20:37.624
as blockades are being set up
at major intersections

01:20:37.708 --> 01:20:39.334
within a 30-mile radius,

01:20:39.418 --> 01:20:42.712
surrounding what will be considered
the largest attack

01:20:42.796 --> 01:20:45.548
on this city's police department
in our history.

01:20:46.050 --> 01:20:49.761
Any citizens with information
leading to the apprehension...

01:21:23.337 --> 01:21:24.837
What the fuck?

01:21:42.898 --> 01:21:44.691
Hello, Dr. Gordon.

01:21:45.985 --> 01:21:48.611
You are perhaps my greatest asset.

01:22:02.793 --> 01:22:06.296
Congratulations, Dr. Gordon. You survived.

01:22:20.311 --> 01:22:26.566
Without you, my work over the last few years
would not have been possible.

01:22:34.908 --> 01:22:36.159
Jeff's wife.

01:22:36.869 --> 01:22:38.244
Dr. Lynn Denlon.

01:22:42.916 --> 01:22:44.042
She'll be perfect.

01:22:51.175 --> 01:22:53.009
My eyes! I can't see!

01:23:09.318 --> 01:23:11.402
That having been said, I have a request.

01:23:11.487 --> 01:23:12.945
Watch over Jill.

01:23:14.365 --> 01:23:19.911
And should anything happen to her,
I want you to act immediately on my behalf.

01:23:20.454 --> 01:23:25.208
In return for that,
I will keep no more secrets from you.

01:23:27.628 --> 01:23:29.587
I've shown you a lot of places.

01:23:31.757 --> 01:23:35.760
But there is one that will be, perhaps,
the most meaningful to you.

01:24:16.218 --> 01:24:17.427
I don't think so.

01:24:29.106 --> 01:24:30.273
What do you think you're doing?

01:24:32.526 --> 01:24:34.610
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

01:24:44.955 --> 01:24:45.997
No!

01:24:47.291 --> 01:24:48.791
You can't fucking do this to me.

01:24:49.626 --> 01:24:51.627
Fuck you. No!

01:24:51.712 --> 01:24:52.795
Game over.

01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:54.130
No!
