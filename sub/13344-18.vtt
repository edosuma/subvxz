WEBVTT

00:05.673 --> 00:08.676
Male voice:
PREVIOUSLY, ON
"IN TREATMENT"...

00:08.776 --> 00:10.344
I RUINED THEIR FAMILY.

00:10.444 --> 00:12.546
DARLENE TOLD ME BEFORE
SHE LEFT FOR WISCONSIN

00:12.646 --> 00:14.915
THAT SHE WAS ONLY GOING
BECAUSE SHE KNEW

00:15.015 --> 00:16.650
I WOULD BE THERE
TO TAKE CARE OF DANA.

00:16.750 --> 00:19.187
SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T TRUST
CY BUT SHE TRUSTED ME.

00:19.287 --> 00:21.589
SHE TRUSTED ME
AND I RUINED IT.

00:21.689 --> 00:23.357
ONE NIGHT...

00:26.194 --> 00:28.296
IT HAPPENED.

00:28.396 --> 00:31.299
WE ALMOST HAD SEX AGAIN BUT
HE SAID THAT WE HAD TO STOP

00:31.399 --> 00:34.935
HE SAID IT WOULD RUIN BOTH
OF OUR CAREERS IF THIS GOT OUT.

00:35.035 --> 00:38.072
JUST SAY IT. SHE TRIED
TO KILL HERSELF OR NOT.

00:38.172 --> 00:41.209
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN NOT BEING CAREFUL

00:41.309 --> 00:43.811
AND WANTING
TO COMMIT SUICIDE.

00:52.653 --> 00:54.188
HELLO.

00:54.288 --> 00:56.023
CHARMED, I'M SURE.

00:56.124 --> 00:57.725
( laughs )

01:01.695 --> 01:04.198
IT'S THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT FOR ME.

01:04.298 --> 01:06.934
I'M UTTERLY EXHAUSTED.

01:07.034 --> 01:10.538
I WAS AT THIS AMAZING
PARTY LAST NIGHT.

01:10.638 --> 01:12.406
IT WENT ON AND ON.

01:12.506 --> 01:15.776
I STAYED AWAKE ALL NIGHT
AND THEN I WALKED HERE.

01:17.178 --> 01:19.012
NO FOOD, NO SLEEP,

01:19.113 --> 01:21.315
I'M RUNNING ON EMPTY.

01:22.850 --> 01:25.719
I'VE NEVER HAD SO MUCH
TO DRINK IN MY WHOLE LIFE.

01:26.954 --> 01:28.189
THERE WAS THIS GUY,

01:28.289 --> 01:30.758
THIS NEW GUY--

01:30.858 --> 01:33.627
TOTAL EYE CANDY.

01:33.727 --> 01:35.996
HE KEPT WALKING AROUND
WITH TEQUILA SHOTS.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.931
HE KEPT MAKING ME
DRINK THEM.

01:38.031 --> 01:40.734
I MUST'VE HAD...

01:40.834 --> 01:42.603
( laughs )
I DON'T KNOW.

01:42.703 --> 01:45.706
I'VE NEVER BEEN SO WRECKED
IN MY WHOLE LIFE.

01:48.041 --> 01:50.544
( theme music playing )

02:12.099 --> 02:14.101
I HAVE TO TAKE THEM OFF.
DO YOU MIND?

02:14.202 --> 02:16.704
SURE.
YOU'VE GROWN HANDS.

02:18.306 --> 02:21.041
IT'S CRAZY HOW QUICKLY A PERSON
GETS USED TO THINGS.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.444
WHEN I HAD THE CASTS,
IT WAS LIKE

02:23.544 --> 02:25.813
THEY'D ALWAYS BEEN
A PART OF ME, YOU KNOW?

02:25.913 --> 02:28.916
LIKE I'D BEEN
BORN A MONSTER.

02:29.016 --> 02:31.919
NOW, TWO DAYS
AFTER THEY'RE GONE,

02:32.019 --> 02:33.754
IT'S LIKE, "CASTS?
WHAT CASTS?"

02:36.357 --> 02:38.826
UGH, CAN'T BELIEVE
I BOUGHT THEM.

02:38.926 --> 02:41.161
I BUY SHOES
BASICALLY NEVER,

02:41.262 --> 02:43.331
AND WHEN I DO...

02:43.431 --> 02:47.335
THEY MAKE YOU WANT
TO VOMIT, DON'T THEY?

02:56.344 --> 02:57.978
IT'S YOUR FAULT
I BOUGHT THEM, YOU KNOW.

02:58.078 --> 03:01.582
WHY?

03:02.650 --> 03:05.519
MY MOM TOOK ME
SHOPPING LAST WEEK.

03:05.619 --> 03:08.856
THOUGHT SHE WAS TRYING TO BE,
LIKE, MATERNAL OR SOMETHING.

03:08.956 --> 03:11.692
TURNS OUT WE WERE ONLY THERE
BECAUSE YOU CALLED HER

03:11.792 --> 03:13.427
AND TOLD HER I WAS
GONNA OFF MYSELF.

03:13.527 --> 03:16.063
THAT'S NOT WHAT
I SAID, SOPHIE.

03:16.163 --> 03:18.299
- YEAH, WHATEVER.
- NO, SOPHIE,

03:18.399 --> 03:19.933
HONESTLY, I NEVER
SAID THAT.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.969
I SAID WHATEVER.

03:22.069 --> 03:24.505
OKAY.

03:24.605 --> 03:27.207
ANYWAY, I PICKED OUT
THIS JACKET,

03:27.308 --> 03:30.511
THIS ARMY THING THAT
SHE, OF COURSE, HATED.

03:30.611 --> 03:32.313
THEN AS PUNISHMENT
SHE SAID

03:32.413 --> 03:35.549
THAT I HAD TO BUY
SOMETHING FEMININE.

03:35.649 --> 03:38.419
SHE PICKED OUT THOSE BARBIE
SHOES WHILE I PRETENDED

03:38.519 --> 03:40.754
TO RETCH ON
THE MAKEUP COUNTER.

03:43.023 --> 03:44.392
IF I HAD KNOWN
YOU'D CALLED HER,

03:44.492 --> 03:46.694
I NEVER
WOULD'VE GONE SHOPPING.

03:48.929 --> 03:52.165
AND THEN SHE WONDERS WHY I RUN
OFF TO THE GYM TO BE WITH HER--

03:52.266 --> 03:53.401
I MEAN, TO BE WITHOUT HER.

03:53.501 --> 03:56.570
TO GET THE HELL
AWAY FROM HER.

03:56.670 --> 03:59.773
FOR MY LAST BIRTHDAY
SHE GAVE ME A BRA.

03:59.873 --> 04:02.510
A BRA FOR MY BIRTHDAY?

04:02.610 --> 04:05.245
IT'S LIKE GETTING COAL.

04:05.346 --> 04:07.080
IT'S WORSE
THAN GETTING COAL.

04:07.180 --> 04:08.582
AT LEAST YOU CAN BURN COAL.

04:08.682 --> 04:10.651
( laughs )

04:10.751 --> 04:13.821
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE
PUSHY-UPPY WONDER THINGS

04:13.921 --> 04:15.155
WITH THE CLICKY WHEEL.

04:15.255 --> 04:16.824
YOU KNOW?

04:16.924 --> 04:20.494
HALF-BRA, HALF-MACHINE.

04:20.594 --> 04:23.764
SHE WANTS ME TO BE SOME SORT
OF A FUCKING CHEERLEADER.

04:25.899 --> 04:28.336
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY SHE REALLY
HATES THAT I'M A GYMNAST?

04:28.436 --> 04:30.671
- WHY?
- BECAUSE OF MY BOOBS.

04:30.771 --> 04:33.641
- OH?
- SHE THINKS IT WILL
STUNT MY DEVELOPMENT.

04:33.741 --> 04:36.744
"YOUR BOOBS WON'T GROW.
YOU'LL HATE YOUR BODY.

04:36.844 --> 04:38.245
YOU'LL BE DEFORMED."

04:38.346 --> 04:40.348
THAT'S ALL SHE CARES ABOUT,

04:40.448 --> 04:43.517
WHETHER OR NOT
I GROW A RACK.

04:43.617 --> 04:46.754
SO I WON'T HAVE BIG BOOBS,
WHO GIVES A FLYING FUCK?

04:47.755 --> 04:49.423
MUST BE PRETTY
HARD FOR YOU,

04:49.523 --> 04:51.992
TRYING TO AVOID
YOUR MOM ALL THE TIME.

04:53.226 --> 04:55.095
JUST THE OPPOSITE.

04:55.195 --> 04:56.830
I ENJOY IT.

04:56.930 --> 04:58.932
OH, REALLY? WHY?

05:00.968 --> 05:04.204
A FEW MINUTES AGO
YOU SAID YOU HAD TO
RUN OFF TO THE GYM

05:04.304 --> 05:05.939
IN ORDER
TO BE WITH HER.

05:09.176 --> 05:11.379
HOW EXTRAORDINARY,
DR. FREUD.

05:11.479 --> 05:13.414
WHATEVER DO YOU
THINK I MEANT?

05:17.451 --> 05:20.588
MAYBE IT MEANS THAT...

05:20.688 --> 05:23.624
NO MATTER WHAT I DO,
I CAN'T GET RID OF HER.

05:26.760 --> 05:29.029
HMM.

05:29.129 --> 05:31.632
MAYBE IT MEANS THAT, UM...

05:31.732 --> 05:35.436
IN ORDER TO KEEP HER
INTERESTED IN YOU...

05:36.269 --> 05:38.338
YOU FEEL YOU HAVE TO

05:38.439 --> 05:40.340
RUN AWAY.

05:42.142 --> 05:43.677
THAT DOESN'T
EVEN MAKE SENSE.

05:43.777 --> 05:46.914
YOU SOUND LIKE
A FORTUNE COOKIE.

05:48.281 --> 05:50.150
HAVE YOU EVER WORN SHOES
LIKE THAT BEFORE?

05:50.250 --> 05:52.085
OH YEAH, ALL THE TIME.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.787
I MEAN, DON'T YOU?

05:55.456 --> 05:57.825
THIS TYPE OF HEEL
RAISES YOUR BUTT

05:57.925 --> 05:59.192
AND SHAPES YOUR CALF.

05:59.292 --> 06:00.828
AND THAT'S ESSENTIAL.

06:00.928 --> 06:02.996
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND
YOU PICK UP A PAIR, PAUL.

06:03.096 --> 06:07.735
MUST REMEMBER TO DO THAT.

06:07.835 --> 06:10.771
SO WHY DID YOU
WEAR THEM LAST NIGHT?

06:13.140 --> 06:15.976
- I DON'T KNOW.
- REALLY?

06:16.076 --> 06:17.878
NO IDEA?

06:19.079 --> 06:20.748
NO?

06:20.848 --> 06:22.382
HMM.

06:22.483 --> 06:25.986
THEY REMIND ME
OF DOROTHY'S SHOES.

06:27.455 --> 06:29.623
- WHO'S DOROTHY?
- FROM "THE WIZARD OF OZ."

06:29.723 --> 06:32.259
OH, YOU SAID DOROTHY LIKE
SHE WAS A FRIEND OF YOURS.

06:32.359 --> 06:33.661
OH.

06:33.761 --> 06:35.763
THEY'RE NOTHING
LIKE DOROTHY'S SHOES.

06:35.863 --> 06:38.499
DOROTHY WAS COOL.
HER SHOES WERE RETRO.

06:40.067 --> 06:42.102
HMM.

06:42.202 --> 06:44.572
- OH NO.
- WHAT?

06:44.672 --> 06:46.640
PLEASE DON'T SAY,
"THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE HOME."

06:46.740 --> 06:48.842
'CAUSE IF YOU DO,
I MIGHT HAVE TO PUKE

06:48.942 --> 06:50.744
ALL OVER YOUR SOFA.

06:50.844 --> 06:52.746
NO, AT THE END,
WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY

06:52.846 --> 06:54.782
WAS THAT DOROTHY DISCOVERS
THAT SHE CAN GO HOME

06:54.882 --> 06:58.852
ANYTIME SHE WANTS
WITH OR WITHOUT HER SHOES.

07:00.521 --> 07:02.756
WHY ARE YOU
INFANTILIZING ME?

07:05.859 --> 07:09.530
I APOLOGIZE IF--

07:09.630 --> 07:11.632
IF THAT'S HOW
IT SOUNDED, SOPHIE.

07:11.732 --> 07:14.802
I REALLY DIDN'T
INTEND THAT.

07:16.369 --> 07:18.639
SO, HAVE YOU TAKEN
YOUR SATs YET?

07:18.739 --> 07:20.641
NOT YET.

07:20.741 --> 07:23.343
I HAVE A FEELING THAT YOU'RE
GOING TO DO REALLY WELL.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.178
I EXPECT TO.

07:27.515 --> 07:30.250
SO YOUR MOTHER
BOUGHT YOU THESE SHOES,

07:30.350 --> 07:32.720
YOU HATE THEM
AND YOU STILL WORE THEM.

07:32.820 --> 07:34.387
WHY?

07:34.488 --> 07:36.590
I'M AT A TOTAL LOSS.

07:36.690 --> 07:39.259
BUT, HEY, WHY DON'T YOU
CALL UP MY MOTHER

07:39.359 --> 07:40.828
AND SAY,
"HI, SOPHIE'S MOM,

07:40.928 --> 07:43.363
SOPHIE WORE THOSE BARBIE
SHOES THAT YOU BOUGHT HER,

07:43.463 --> 07:46.433
WENT OUT TO A BAR,
SCREWED HALF THE U.S.
OLYMPIC GYMNASTIC TEAM

07:46.534 --> 07:49.136
AND NOW SHE'S
GONNA KILL HERSELF"?

07:54.575 --> 07:56.510
WHY'D YOU DO IT ANYWAY?

07:56.610 --> 07:58.211
WHY'D YOU CALL HER?

07:58.311 --> 08:01.682
BECAUSE I WAS
WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

08:01.782 --> 08:04.217
SUDDENLY EVERYONE'S
SO WORRIED ABOUT ME.

08:04.317 --> 08:05.919
DID YOU CALL CY TOO?

08:06.019 --> 08:09.056
HE'S TURNED
INTO MY GRANDMOTHER.
HE WON'T LET ME TRAIN.

08:10.591 --> 08:13.861
HE'S MAKING ME DO CLASSES
WITH THE 10-YEAR-OLDS.

08:13.961 --> 08:16.597
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

08:16.697 --> 08:18.766
NOW I REMEMBER WHAT
I WANTED TO TELL YOU.

08:18.866 --> 08:21.468
THE MOST AMAZING THING HAPPENED
AT THE GYM THE OTHER DAY.

08:21.569 --> 08:23.103
EVEN THOUGH I HAVEN'T
BEEN TRAINING,

08:23.203 --> 08:26.306
I'VE BEEN ABSORBING STUFF
JUST BY WATCHING.

08:26.406 --> 08:28.642
'CAUSE I HAVE
THIS CHRONIC PROBLEM

08:28.742 --> 08:30.377
WITH MY TOES GOING OFF
THE EDGE OF THE BEAM

08:30.477 --> 08:31.879
WHEN I LAND A HARD ELEMENT.

08:31.979 --> 08:34.782
IT'S BECAUSE I'M
NATURALLY KNOCK-KNEED.

08:34.882 --> 08:36.650
MY KNEES,
THEY FACE INWARDS.

08:36.750 --> 08:39.319
SO IN ORDER TO GET THEM
FACING STRAIGHT

08:39.419 --> 08:41.088
MY FEET HAVE TO POINT OUT,

08:41.188 --> 08:44.758
WHICH IS GOOD FOR BALLET
BUT BAD FOR GYMNASTICS.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.660
JUST A TOE
IN THE WRONG POSITION

08:46.760 --> 08:48.361
CAN LOSE YOU THE EVENT.

08:48.461 --> 08:50.898
I'M TALKING
ABOUT MEDALS HERE.

08:50.998 --> 08:53.033
SO ANYWAY,

08:53.133 --> 08:54.401
I'M ON THE BEAM, RIGHT?

08:54.501 --> 08:56.503
AND I'VE BEEN TRAINING
AT NIGHTTIME,

08:56.604 --> 08:58.839
EVEN THOUGH MY BODY
DOESN'T WANT TO YET.

09:00.974 --> 09:02.710
IT WAS LIKE...

09:02.810 --> 09:05.545
WHEN I WAS LITTLE
AND I USED TO STARVE MYSELF

09:05.646 --> 09:07.414
AND THERE WOULD BE
THIS PERIOD,

09:07.514 --> 09:08.916
USUALLY IN THE MORNING,

09:09.016 --> 09:12.686
WHERE I WAS REALLY
REALLY HUNGRY.

09:12.786 --> 09:15.422
YOU KNOW, SO HUNGRY THAT
I THOUGHT THAT MY STOMACH

09:15.522 --> 09:18.325
MIGHT JUST START EATING
THE REST OF ME.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.095
AND THEN IT WOULD GO AWAY--

09:22.195 --> 09:25.833
SUDDENLY-- LIKE TURNING
OFF A LIGHT SWITCH.

09:25.933 --> 09:29.069
AND I FELT LIKE I WAS
FLOATING ON CLOUDS.

09:29.169 --> 09:31.438
IT WAS THE SAME
WITH THE PAIN THIS TIME.

09:31.538 --> 09:34.341
I PUSHED THROUGH IT
UNTIL IT JUST LET UP

09:34.441 --> 09:35.809
ALL OF A SUDDEN.

09:35.909 --> 09:39.046
AND THEN I FELT LIKE
I DIDN'T HAVE A BODY AT ALL,

09:39.146 --> 09:42.816
LIKE I WAS JUST A PAIR
OF SOMERSAULTING EYES.

09:46.787 --> 09:49.489
SO YESTERDAY I MARCHED
INTO THE GYM

09:49.589 --> 09:51.258
AND I GOT UP ON THE BEAM.

09:51.358 --> 09:55.062
EVERYONE WAS IN SHOCK AND I FELT
THIS SILENCE ALL AROUND ME.

09:55.162 --> 09:57.665
- SOPHIE, BE CAREFUL, PLEASE.
- THEN SOMETHING INSIDE OF ME,

09:57.765 --> 09:59.466
SOME LITTLE VOICE SAID,

09:59.566 --> 10:01.368
"PROVE IT."

10:01.468 --> 10:03.503
SO I STARTED
THE FIRST ELEMENT.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.038
- HERE, I'LL SHOW YOU.
- NO, SOPHIE,

10:05.138 --> 10:07.074
PLEASE BE CAREFUL.
THIS IS DANGEROUS.

10:07.174 --> 10:09.910
DON'T HAVE A COW, PAUL.
I'M FINE.

10:10.010 --> 10:13.881
SO ANYWAY, I BEGIN
THE FIRST ELEMENT.

10:19.853 --> 10:21.588
AND WHEN I LOOK
BACK AT MY FEET,

10:21.689 --> 10:23.123
THEY WERE RIGHT
ON THE BEAM.

10:23.223 --> 10:26.694
IT'S NOTHING MAJOR, BUT
I TOOK IT AS A SORT OF SIGN.

10:26.794 --> 10:30.430
AFTERWARDS, EVERYONE TOLD ME
CY WAS SO SHOCKED THAT
HE COULDN'T BREATHE.

10:30.530 --> 10:31.699
WELL, I BET HE WAS.

10:31.799 --> 10:33.133
I DID A BACKFLIP.

10:39.106 --> 10:42.642
- I LANDED PERFECTLY.
- THAT WAS INCREDIBLE.

10:42.743 --> 10:44.477
I JUST WALKED
BACK TO THE BENCH

10:44.577 --> 10:46.013
LIKE IT WAS NO BIG DEAL.

10:46.113 --> 10:48.215
I COULD FEEL EVERYBODY'S
EYES ON MY BACK

10:48.315 --> 10:50.951
AND I WANTED TO
TURN AROUND AND JUST...

10:51.051 --> 10:52.352
AND WHAT?

10:52.452 --> 10:54.254
NOTHING.

10:54.354 --> 10:57.224
NO, COME ON, TELL ME.

11:00.861 --> 11:03.196
I WANTED TO FLIP THEM
THE BIRD WITH BOTH HANDS

11:03.296 --> 11:05.999
LIKE, "FUCK ALL OF YOU
AND THE FISH YOU SWAM IN ON."

11:06.099 --> 11:07.768
( laughs )

11:07.868 --> 11:09.536
I THOUGHT IT WAS THE, UM...

11:09.636 --> 11:12.072
THE HORSE THAT
YOU RODE IN ON.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.841
NOT IN MY BOOK.

11:13.941 --> 11:16.744
IN MY BOOK IT'S A FISH.

11:26.854 --> 11:29.156
WHAT IS IT, SOPHIE?

11:29.256 --> 11:31.191
WHAT'S WRONG?

11:31.291 --> 11:32.826
I DON'T FEEL WELL.

11:32.926 --> 11:35.462
DO YOU WANT SOME WATER?

11:35.562 --> 11:38.231
DO YOU FEEL A PAIN?

11:38.331 --> 11:40.233
WAIT A SECOND.

11:40.333 --> 11:42.202
JUST WAIT, IT'LL GO AWAY.

11:55.482 --> 11:58.418
( quietly )
STOP IT, SOPHIE.

11:59.619 --> 12:02.089
- STOP IT.
- WHAT IS IT?

12:07.227 --> 12:09.629
SOPHIE, LOOK AT ME.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.364
PLEASE.

12:17.537 --> 12:19.206
WHAT IS IT?

12:22.776 --> 12:25.178
WHAT GOES ON IN THERE?

12:26.613 --> 12:28.748
TELL ME.

12:34.354 --> 12:36.689
AROUND 2:00 A.M.,
HE TOOK ME TO HIS ROOM.

12:36.790 --> 12:38.358
WHO DID?

12:38.458 --> 12:40.861
THE NEW GUY
WITH THE TEQUILA.

12:40.961 --> 12:44.397
HE'S FROM MINNESOTA
OR MICHIGAN OR SOMEWHERE,

12:44.497 --> 12:46.466
AND HE'S A BRILLIANT GYMNAST.

12:48.001 --> 12:49.669
HE WANTED TO HAVE SEX,

12:49.769 --> 12:52.572
BUT HE COULDN'T
GET IT UP.

12:52.672 --> 12:55.943
HE WAS PRETTY WASTED TOO.

12:56.043 --> 12:58.145
AND THEN HE DID
AND THEN WE HAD SEX

12:58.245 --> 13:01.181
AND I DIDN'T
FEEL ANYTHING.

13:02.850 --> 13:04.751
AS USUAL.

13:04.852 --> 13:08.088
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

13:11.258 --> 13:13.060
AFTERWARDS HE SAID
THAT I FUCKED

13:13.160 --> 13:15.795
LIKE SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN
SEXUALLY ABUSED.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.435
PRICK.

13:24.905 --> 13:26.106
I'M SORRY, GO ON.

13:26.206 --> 13:28.641
WE WENT
TO THE GIRLS' HOUSE,

13:28.741 --> 13:31.744
TO THE ROOM THAT
I SOMETIMES STAY IN.

13:31.845 --> 13:34.948
I TRIED TO GO TO SLEEP
BUT I COULDN'T STOP THINKING
ABOUT WHAT HE'D SAID.

13:36.716 --> 13:38.285
I WAS AFRAID THAT
IF I FELL ASLEEP

13:38.385 --> 13:41.188
I WOULDN'T GET UP
IN TIME TO COME
HERE SO...

13:41.288 --> 13:44.691
AND WHEN I CLOSED MY EYES
I SAW THESE HORRIBLE IMAGES.

13:44.791 --> 13:46.393
WHAT?

13:46.493 --> 13:48.828
LIKE EVERYTHING AROUND ME
WAS FALLING APART,

13:48.929 --> 13:50.663
YOU KNOW, DISINTEGRATING,

13:50.763 --> 13:54.701
TURNING INTO ASH
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.

13:54.801 --> 13:57.905
AND I FORCED MYSELF TO THINK
OF SOMETHING PRETTY AND NICE

13:58.005 --> 14:01.808
LIKE A PASTURE IN THE SUNLIGHT
AND TO HOLD IT THERE--

14:01.909 --> 14:03.877
THAT IMAGE.

14:03.977 --> 14:05.946
BUT AS SOON AS I STARTED
TO FALL ASLEEP

14:06.046 --> 14:07.814
THE PASTURE WOULD
TURN TO ROT.

14:07.915 --> 14:10.583
IT WAS TERRIBLE.

14:10.683 --> 14:13.420
AND THAT REMINDED ME
OF THE ACCIDENT
FOR SOME REASON.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.622
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

14:17.257 --> 14:19.159
I WAS SCARED THAT
IF I SLEPT

14:19.259 --> 14:20.593
I'D DREAM ABOUT
THE ACCIDENT.

14:20.693 --> 14:23.030
SO I GOT UP
AND I WALKED

14:23.130 --> 14:26.799
TO THE BUS STOP
VERY SLOWLY,

14:26.900 --> 14:28.168
BACKWARDS ACTUALLY,

14:28.268 --> 14:31.538
JUST TO SLOW MYSELF DOWN.

14:31.638 --> 14:34.041
THE BUSES WEREN'T
RUNNING YET,

14:34.141 --> 14:37.344
SO I SAT ON THE BENCH.

14:37.444 --> 14:39.646
YEAH? AND WHAT?

14:41.581 --> 14:44.551
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING ABOUT
WHEN YOU SAT ON THE BENCH?

14:46.086 --> 14:48.188
I WAS THINKING ABOUT DANA.

14:54.928 --> 14:57.130
I COULDN'T BREATHE.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.865
THE NIGHT OF THE ACCIDENT,

14:58.966 --> 15:01.368
WHEN I LEFT DARLENE'S HOUSE
AND GOT ON THE BIKE,

15:01.468 --> 15:04.604
ALL OF A SUDDEN
I COULDN'T BREATHE.

15:04.704 --> 15:07.074
MY THROAT CLOSED UP.

15:08.441 --> 15:10.710
THERE'S THIS BLIND TURN
AT THE END OF THEIR HILL,

15:10.810 --> 15:12.679
AND WHEN I WENT AROUND IT

15:12.779 --> 15:15.882
A WHITE CAR,
IT ALMOST HIT ME.

15:15.983 --> 15:18.385
- I DON'T REMEMBER.
- GO ON, SOPHIE.

15:18.485 --> 15:21.121
- WHAT HAPPENED
WITH THE WHITE CAR?
- I DON'T REMEMBER.

15:21.221 --> 15:23.323
GO ON, SOPHIE, PLEASE.
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.

15:23.423 --> 15:24.924
I TOLD YOU I DON'T
REMEMBER ANYTHING ELSE.

15:25.025 --> 15:26.459
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO THIS ALONE.

15:26.559 --> 15:28.195
I DON'T WANT TO.

15:38.871 --> 15:40.507
GO ON.

15:45.012 --> 15:46.646
THE SEAT WAS HURTING ME.

15:49.149 --> 15:51.484
IT WAS CY'S BIKE,
A MAN'S BIKE,

15:51.584 --> 15:52.919
SO IT HAD A NARROW SEAT.

15:53.020 --> 15:55.488
THAT'S WHY
IT WAS HURTING ME.

16:00.060 --> 16:02.362
WHEN I REACHED
THE BLIND TURN

16:02.462 --> 16:05.865
A WHITE CAR CAME AROUND
AND ALMOST HIT ME.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.968
IT HAD THE BRIGHTS ON
SO IT BLINDED ME.

16:09.069 --> 16:11.471
IT SWERVED AWAY FROM ME
AND THEN HONKED AND--

16:11.571 --> 16:13.540
IT WAS SO WEIRD.

16:13.640 --> 16:16.243
THE ROAD JUST SORT OF
STARTED COMING AT ME,

16:16.343 --> 16:19.479
SORT OF ATTACKING ME
REALLY FAST,

16:19.579 --> 16:22.582
LIKE I WAS FALLING FROM
SOMEWHERE VERY HIGH.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.422
AND I WANTED IT.

16:31.724 --> 16:33.726
I WANTED TO HEAR
A HUGE BOOM

16:33.826 --> 16:35.495
AND THEN I WANTED
TO HEAR NOTHING.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.541
I'M TRYING
TO KILL MYSELF.

16:55.748 --> 16:58.051
I'M A FUCKING FREAK.

17:06.826 --> 17:08.495
YOU'RE NOT A FREAK.

17:20.107 --> 17:21.741
WHAT HAPPENED THEN?

17:27.247 --> 17:30.049
IT WAS AS IF
IT HAD ALREADY HAPPENED.

17:31.851 --> 17:33.353
AS SOON AS
THE WHITE CAR PASSED

17:33.453 --> 17:36.656
I KNEW I WAS GOING TO
HAVE AN ACCIDENT.

17:36.756 --> 17:40.026
AND I JUST FELT CALM.

17:40.127 --> 17:43.996
I TURNED THE HANDLEBARS
JUST THE SMALLEST LITTLE
BIT TO THE LEFT.

17:44.097 --> 17:46.166
I REMEMBER THINKING,

17:46.266 --> 17:48.568
"JUST THIS TINY LITTLE
MOVEMENT IS ENOUGH."

17:51.371 --> 17:53.606
THEN I RODE INTO THE STREET.

17:55.308 --> 17:57.677
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANOTHER
CAR NOT TO HIT ME.

17:57.777 --> 18:00.079
AND I FELT JUST FREE--

18:00.180 --> 18:03.616
FREE AND STRONG.

18:03.716 --> 18:06.686
I HAD THIS ADRENALINE RUSH
LIKE NOTHING COULD TOUCH ME.

18:08.721 --> 18:11.324
WHAT IS THAT ABOUT?

18:11.424 --> 18:13.893
MAYBE YOU FELT LIKE
YOU WERE IN CONTROL.

18:13.993 --> 18:15.462
- YES.
- YEAH?

18:26.339 --> 18:28.408
AND THEN I WAS IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD

18:28.508 --> 18:30.843
AND THERE WAS THIS
TERRIBLE SCREECHING SOUND

18:30.943 --> 18:32.111
AND THEN A BOOM.

18:32.212 --> 18:34.181
AND I REMEMBER
I SAID TO MYSELF,

18:34.281 --> 18:37.617
"OH."
JUST "OH."

18:38.718 --> 18:40.820
AND I FLEW INTO THE AIR.

18:40.920 --> 18:42.322
I COULD SUDDENLY
BREATHE AGAIN.

18:42.422 --> 18:44.491
I HAD ALL THIS AIR
IN MY LUNGS.

18:47.927 --> 18:49.762
AND THEN YOU WERE
ON THE GROUND

18:49.862 --> 18:53.266
AND YOU WERE LYING THERE.
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT--

18:53.366 --> 18:57.337
WHAT WAS GOING
THROUGH YOUR HEAD?

19:02.074 --> 19:04.444
THAT I FINALLY KILLED HER.

19:05.912 --> 19:07.580
KILLED WHO, SOPHIE?

19:07.680 --> 19:11.284
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT
WHEN I LANDED.

19:13.186 --> 19:14.621
WHO DID YOU KILL, SOPHIE?

19:14.721 --> 19:16.356
I DON'T KNOW.

19:37.977 --> 19:40.413
( coughing )

20:19.986 --> 20:21.921
( doorknob rattles )

20:24.257 --> 20:27.460
( flushes )

20:53.119 --> 20:54.787
SOPHIE?

20:59.826 --> 21:01.260
SOPHIE, ARE YOU OKAY?

21:01.361 --> 21:03.630
UH-HUH.
I'LL BE RIGHT OUT.

21:42.034 --> 21:43.970
YOU FEEL BETTER?

21:44.070 --> 21:47.173
I THINK I'LL GO HOME.

21:47.273 --> 21:50.009
WE HAVE A LITTLE
TIME LEFT.

21:50.109 --> 21:52.445
YEAH, BUT I'M REALLY TIRED.

21:52.545 --> 21:54.814
YOU CAN STAY FOR A LITTLE
BIT LONGER IF YOU'D LIKE.

21:54.914 --> 21:56.849
I THINK I'LL GO HOME.

21:57.917 --> 22:01.388
BUT WAIT, I HAVE
THE MAGIC SLIPPERS

22:01.488 --> 22:03.890
THAT CLEARLY I CAN
CLICK THREE TIMES

22:03.990 --> 22:06.759
AND SUDDENLY EVERYBODY I LOVE
WILL BE RIGHT BY MY SIDE.

22:08.828 --> 22:11.130
AND YOU'RE LIKE
THE WIZARD OF OZ.

22:11.230 --> 22:14.033
YOU THINK YOU KNOW EVERYTHING
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW SHIT.

22:16.603 --> 22:18.938
PLUS, YOU'RE ALWAYS
BEHIND THAT CURTAIN.

22:19.038 --> 22:20.473
WHAT CURTAIN?

22:20.573 --> 22:24.076
LET'S SEE YOU
DO SOME MAGIC.

22:24.176 --> 22:27.380
WHAT AM I
THINKING RIGHT NOW?

22:27.480 --> 22:28.815
I DON'T KNOW.

22:28.915 --> 22:32.184
SOPHIE, I CAN'T
READ YOUR MIND.

22:32.284 --> 22:34.621
TRY.

22:37.223 --> 22:39.692
PLEASE TRY,
MR. MAGIC MAN.

22:41.461 --> 22:44.296
ARE YOU ANGRY THAT I MADE
YOU REMEMBER THE ACCIDENT?

22:44.397 --> 22:46.198
IS THAT IT?

22:46.298 --> 22:47.834
THAT'S NOT
WHAT I WAS THINKING.

22:47.934 --> 22:50.970
- YOU LOSE.
- SOPHIE, ARE YOU OKAY?

22:51.070 --> 22:53.806
- YOU MUST HAVE SOMEONE
ELSE COMING HERE, RIGHT?
- I DON'T HAVE ANYBODY--

22:53.906 --> 22:55.842
I DON'T FEEL LIKE SEEING
ANYONE LIKE THIS.

22:55.942 --> 22:58.645
I'M A LITTLE
WORRIED ABOUT YOU, PLEASE.
SOPHIE, PLEASE.

22:58.745 --> 23:01.380
I THOUGHT THAT THE SHOOTING
TIMES WERE ALWAYS FIXED.

23:01.481 --> 23:02.882
WHAT SHOOTING?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

23:02.982 --> 23:04.984
I THOUGHT THAT THEY ALWAYS
CAME AT THE SAME--

23:05.084 --> 23:07.954
- WHO?
- THE MODELS.

23:08.054 --> 23:09.756
SOPHIE.

23:09.856 --> 23:11.991
OH, GOD.

23:28.174 --> 23:32.945
( theme music playing )
