01:02.855 --> 01:04.065
Thad...

01:04.147 --> 01:05.983
I said no toys at Grandfather's.

01:06.067 --> 01:08.194
But it's Christmas.

01:09.779 --> 01:11.197
- Stop it!
- Hey.

01:11.280 --> 01:12.281
Hey, Dad!

01:12.365 --> 01:14.242
Hey! Thad,

01:14.325 --> 01:17.078
you can't go crying to other people
all the time.

01:17.161 --> 01:20.790
A man needs to know
when to stand up for himself.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.918
Dear Magic-Isn't-Real Ball,

01:24.001 --> 01:25.753
will Thad ever be a man?

01:29.382 --> 01:31.300
Ouch.

01:31.384 --> 01:33.219
"Outlook not so good."

01:45.356 --> 01:46.607
You broke it.

01:48.526 --> 01:50.569
Dad? Sid?

01:55.950 --> 01:57.326
Someone help me!

01:58.869 --> 02:01.080
Help!

02:28.774 --> 02:29.859
Hello?

02:50.046 --> 02:51.547
Thaddeus.

03:22.453 --> 03:24.914
Thaddeus Sivana.

03:25.915 --> 03:27.333
Who are you?

03:28.209 --> 03:29.293
How do you know my name?

03:29.377 --> 03:32.755
I am the last of the Council of Wizards.

03:33.839 --> 03:38.594
Sworn to protect the realms
from the Seven Deadly Sins.

03:42.014 --> 03:43.891
But years have passed,

03:44.642 --> 03:46.435
and I grow weak.

03:47.019 --> 03:49.230
That is why I seek a champion

03:49.313 --> 03:51.482
to inherit my magic.

03:51.565 --> 03:54.110
You want me to do magic?

03:54.735 --> 03:56.070
With this,

03:57.154 --> 03:59.782
all of my powers will become yours.

04:05.204 --> 04:06.914
Ah. But first...

04:08.416 --> 04:11.001
you must demonstrate
that you're pure of heart

04:11.085 --> 04:13.129
and strong in spirit.

04:16.173 --> 04:18.466
He lies.

04:19.301 --> 04:22.888
Don't be his champion.

04:23.472 --> 04:26.684
We can give you power.

04:27.435 --> 04:30.312
Take the eye.

04:33.649 --> 04:34.525
Take it.

04:36.986 --> 04:40.030
Your father thinks you're weak.

04:40.114 --> 04:43.117
Show him your power.

04:46.078 --> 04:47.246
Take the eye.

04:53.711 --> 04:55.254
No!!!

04:56.881 --> 04:57.882
What?

04:57.965 --> 04:59.300
What happened?

04:59.383 --> 05:04.054
Only the purest of hearts
can resist their temptations.

05:04.638 --> 05:05.973
But you,

05:06.056 --> 05:07.725
you will never be worthy.

05:15.232 --> 05:16.108
Wait.

05:16.192 --> 05:18.235
- I'm good enough, I swear!
- What?

05:18.319 --> 05:19.570
Let me back in!

05:19.653 --> 05:21.238
Calm down, Thad!

05:21.322 --> 05:22.480
- Don't open the door!
- Stop it!

05:22.490 --> 05:23.699
- Calm down.
- Stop!

05:23.782 --> 05:25.422
Hey, I'm gonna kill you,
you little freak!

05:28.245 --> 05:29.747
Stop... Oh!

05:44.595 --> 05:45.930
I was just there.

05:46.013 --> 05:49.183
This man, this wizard,
he took me to a castle and...

05:49.266 --> 05:50.643
Stop. Stop!

05:50.726 --> 05:52.061
Stop it!

05:52.603 --> 05:56.023
You miserable, whiny, little shit!

05:56.106 --> 05:57.942
You could have killed us!

05:58.025 --> 05:59.652
Do you understand that?

06:45.990 --> 06:47.241
Dad?

06:47.324 --> 06:48.325
Dad!

07:01.088 --> 07:02.131
Dad?

07:04.216 --> 07:05.342
You're okay.

07:06.135 --> 07:07.136
You're gonna be okay.

07:14.435 --> 07:16.145
You did this.

07:16.228 --> 07:17.688
You did this!

07:19.106 --> 07:20.190
No.

07:20.274 --> 07:21.191
Dad.

07:44.423 --> 07:47.551
Your magic grows weak.

07:47.635 --> 07:52.014
Soon, you won't be able to contain us.

07:52.681 --> 07:54.683
Seeking Spell,

07:55.267 --> 07:58.354
find me one soul who is worthy.

08:00.856 --> 08:03.776
No matter how long it takes.

08:48.404 --> 08:51.115
Holy moly! The boys in blue!

08:51.198 --> 08:52.866
Sure glad to see you.

08:52.950 --> 08:54.993
I called as soon as I saw.

08:55.953 --> 08:57.246
They're in there.

08:57.329 --> 08:58.414
You stay here.

09:02.543 --> 09:04.294
Police!

09:04.878 --> 09:06.130
I saw 'em hide back in there.

09:11.301 --> 09:12.761
- Police, coming in!
- Police!

09:16.306 --> 09:17.589
- There's nobody here.
- What do you mean?

09:17.599 --> 09:19.518
- It's a closet.
- You really bought that, huh?

09:22.396 --> 09:24.273
- Hey, no, no, no!
- Hey!

09:25.941 --> 09:27.192
Stop, stop, stop!

09:29.319 --> 09:30.779
Open this up right now, kid.

09:30.863 --> 09:32.783
That's a federal offense, kid.
You can't do that!

09:32.823 --> 09:34.700
Do not go in that car.

09:34.783 --> 09:36.023
Come on, open the door. Please.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.578
Please, come on.

09:40.122 --> 09:42.541
Open this, right now!

09:44.251 --> 09:45.544
Very good, very funny.

09:45.627 --> 09:47.307
Very funny. That's great.
That's hilarious.

09:51.675 --> 09:54.475
Uh, Dispatch, we need backup at
the Laurelwood shopping center, please.

09:56.430 --> 09:58.182
Dispatch, cancel that request.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.309
Some kid stole our walkie-talkies.

10:00.392 --> 10:03.312
<i>Walkie-talkies? How old are you?</i>

10:09.234 --> 10:10.778
No, no, no.

10:10.861 --> 10:11.820
That's my lunch, kid!

10:16.325 --> 10:17.618
Miss Batson...

10:18.494 --> 10:20.287
I've been looking for you.

10:20.370 --> 10:22.664
No. Gosh.

10:24.917 --> 10:26.543
It's me. It's Billy.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.637
Okay.

10:40.474 --> 10:42.559
I want the tiger.

10:42.643 --> 10:46.438
I know, honey, I know.
But Mom's not exactly going pro here.

10:48.857 --> 10:51.068
We got one!

10:53.529 --> 10:55.405
But I wanted a tiger.

10:55.489 --> 10:59.117
Oh, but this is
the real prize, baby. See?

10:59.701 --> 11:01.119
You can use that your whole life.

11:01.203 --> 11:03.330
You'll always find your way.

11:23.559 --> 11:25.602
I can't let the ball get away.

11:34.820 --> 11:35.821
Mom?

11:42.077 --> 11:42.995
Mom!

11:49.960 --> 11:51.169
Mom!

11:52.963 --> 11:54.381
Hey.

11:54.464 --> 11:55.674
Who are you with, bud?

11:58.176 --> 11:59.678
Yeah, he says it's Billy Batson.

12:01.471 --> 12:02.681
Hey, don't worry, kid.

12:03.265 --> 12:05.324
I'm sure she'll come looking
before too long, okay?

12:05.809 --> 12:07.060
They always do.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.905
Mom, I'm home.

12:51.480 --> 12:52.397
Yes?

12:53.565 --> 12:57.277
Yeah, uh, is this Rachel Batson?

12:57.361 --> 12:58.695
Who's asking?

12:59.071 --> 13:00.072
Um...

13:00.155 --> 13:01.657
Yeah, see, the thing is...

13:03.533 --> 13:04.826
I think you're my mom.

13:08.580 --> 13:09.706
You sure about that?

13:13.085 --> 13:14.336
Sorry to bother you.

13:20.217 --> 13:22.511
Just had to take my lunch, huh?

13:22.594 --> 13:24.179
You save me any fries?

13:25.555 --> 13:29.434
Foster home in Pittsburgh
reported you missing two weeks ago.

13:29.518 --> 13:30.519
You're sending me back?

13:31.103 --> 13:32.062
No.

13:32.688 --> 13:33.897
They don't want you.

13:34.189 --> 13:36.650
- Harsh.
- You laugh,

13:36.733 --> 13:40.028
but you've run from foster homes
in six counties, Mr. Batson.

13:40.904 --> 13:43.115
From good people

13:43.949 --> 13:46.243
who want you, all in pursuit of someone

13:46.326 --> 13:48.036
who arguably does not.

13:50.372 --> 13:53.083
It's time someone looked you in the eye
and told it to you straight.

13:53.667 --> 13:56.503
I don't need parents
to play make-believe with.

13:56.586 --> 13:58.588
- I got a mom.
- Yes.

13:59.423 --> 14:01.008
You're some detective.

14:01.591 --> 14:03.260
Seventy-three Batsons

14:03.343 --> 14:06.555
between the ages of 28 to 40,
and you've crossed out every one.

14:07.139 --> 14:09.891
She's still out there. I know it.

14:18.734 --> 14:21.278
There's a couple outside, Mr. Batson.

14:21.361 --> 14:22.946
They run a group home.

14:24.489 --> 14:26.074
I can take care of myself.

14:26.158 --> 14:27.367
When you're 18.

14:27.993 --> 14:30.662
Until then,
I won't have you living on the streets,

14:30.746 --> 14:32.748
looking for someone
who never looked for you.

14:34.041 --> 14:35.333
Give these people a chance.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.336
'Cause that's what they're giving you.

14:38.962 --> 14:40.547
You're out of options.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.726
I'm gonna skip the spiel.

14:52.809 --> 14:54.603
Just know that me and Rosa, we get it.

14:54.686 --> 14:56.188
We were foster kids back in the day.

14:56.271 --> 14:57.773
Ooh, back in the Dark Ages.

14:57.856 --> 15:00.358
Girl, I'm young at heart.

15:00.442 --> 15:01.902
I got my finger on the pulse.

15:01.985 --> 15:02.986
Yeah, that's a reference

15:03.070 --> 15:04.780
to his blood pressure because he's old.

15:04.863 --> 15:06.406
Billy, do you have any food allergies?

15:06.490 --> 15:08.241
Gonna wish you did.
Darla's cooking.

15:08.325 --> 15:09.910
What?

15:12.245 --> 15:14.081
We know
how overwhelming it can all be.

15:14.164 --> 15:15.916
New house, new faces.

15:15.999 --> 15:17.584
All up in your face.

15:17.667 --> 15:20.253
Just take it at your own speed.

15:30.138 --> 15:31.306
Hello?

15:35.685 --> 15:36.937
We're home.

15:37.020 --> 15:39.106
That's what happens when you suck!

15:40.524 --> 15:41.858
So much for the welcome party.

15:41.942 --> 15:44.069
Yeah, that thing
growing out of the couch

15:44.152 --> 15:45.529
would be Eugene.

15:45.612 --> 15:46.947
Is that him?

15:47.030 --> 15:48.907
Oh, my gosh! Billy!

15:48.990 --> 15:50.200
Whoa! Slow down, slow down.

15:50.283 --> 15:51.368
Welcome home!

15:51.451 --> 15:53.411
- And that's Darla.
- I'm Darla.

15:53.495 --> 15:54.398
Big hugger.

15:54.412 --> 15:55.789
I noticed.

15:55.872 --> 15:58.083
Die, die, die!

15:58.166 --> 15:59.835
He doesn't mean that.
It's a game.

16:02.379 --> 16:03.588
Hey.

16:03.672 --> 16:05.590
No sodas after dark, remember?

16:06.007 --> 16:07.843
Whoa. When did it get dark?

16:07.926 --> 16:09.886
Oh, the poster.
I made you one.

16:09.970 --> 16:13.223
Come look! Oh, no!

16:13.306 --> 16:15.517
Sorry, Pedro must've been working out.

16:16.059 --> 16:17.686
His goal is to get swole.

16:17.769 --> 16:19.396
Just one hit! Just one hit!

16:19.646 --> 16:20.564
Oh...

16:20.772 --> 16:21.815
Here.

16:23.233 --> 16:26.778
Yes, exactly why your math department
is so uniquely suited for me.

16:26.862 --> 16:28.405
Shut up! No!

16:28.488 --> 16:30.657
I can't even with Eugene right now.

16:30.740 --> 16:33.368
I'm sorry. Mary, hi. College interview.

16:33.451 --> 16:34.494
I'm Billy.

16:34.578 --> 16:36.079
What am I most excited about?

16:36.246 --> 16:39.541
Oh! What a great question.
I was hoping you'd ask.

16:39.624 --> 16:41.168
What am I most excited about?

16:42.460 --> 16:45.297
Mention you're a foster kid.
Colleges eat that up.

16:45.380 --> 16:48.717
What I'm most excited about
is the campus experience.

16:48.800 --> 16:52.262
As a foster child, I'm a big believer
in finding family and friends

16:52.345 --> 16:54.598
in the most unlikely of places.

16:57.601 --> 16:59.603
I'm gonna miss that girl so much.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.486
It's Caltech.
It's a very prestigious school.

17:01.897 --> 17:03.440
And also all the way in California.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.858
But we don't have to talk
about that right now.

17:05.942 --> 17:07.277
It's a tough subject for me.

17:07.359 --> 17:08.569
Do you like vegan food?

17:08.737 --> 17:10.864
- Mmm-mmm.
- Because, see, I love animals.

17:12.781 --> 17:14.617
Oh, no! The Tofurky!

17:14.701 --> 17:16.411
Oh, no, we may have to eat
a real turkey!

17:16.493 --> 17:17.579
- Is that...
- It's okay.

17:17.662 --> 17:19.039
Come, I'll show you your room.

17:19.623 --> 17:22.876
It's a bit of a madhouse,
I know, but it's fun.

17:22.959 --> 17:25.545
Time to dance on your grave!

17:25.628 --> 17:27.214
Watch the bum step. Pedro...

17:29.049 --> 17:30.249
Say hi to Billy.

17:32.135 --> 17:34.804
Don't take it personally.
He's like that with everyone.

17:38.516 --> 17:39.851
Freddy.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.771
This is Billy Batson.

17:42.854 --> 17:44.356
Make sure you make him feel at home.

17:44.439 --> 17:45.565
- Okay?
- Yeah.

17:45.649 --> 17:47.567
Maybe don't say anything too weird?

17:47.651 --> 17:48.693
Oh, one weird thing is,

17:48.777 --> 17:51.457
did you know that Romans used to
brush their teeth with their urine?

17:52.948 --> 17:54.324
And apparently, it works.

17:55.200 --> 17:56.493
Yep. Um...

18:05.543 --> 18:08.004
Oh, it's a long way down.

18:08.088 --> 18:10.298
Trust me, I speak from experience.

18:13.969 --> 18:16.304
Victor pushed me.

18:16.388 --> 18:18.848
They seem nice, but don't buy it.

18:19.516 --> 18:21.351
It gets real Game of Thrones
around here.

18:23.478 --> 18:24.479
What?

18:25.647 --> 18:28.566
Dude, I'm just messin' around.

18:28.733 --> 18:32.153
It's, um, terminal cancer.
I only have three months.

18:34.072 --> 18:36.283
Kidding, again!
You look at me, and you're like,

18:36.366 --> 18:38.846
"Why so dark? You're a disabled
foster kid. You've got it all."

18:38.910 --> 18:39.953
Right?

18:41.621 --> 18:44.791
Oh, yeah, that's the old Batarang.

18:44.874 --> 18:47.585
I mean, it's a replica,
but feel how sharp.

18:47.669 --> 18:49.509
I could kill you in your sleep
with that thing.

18:50.714 --> 18:51.923
You more of a Supes guy?

18:52.757 --> 18:56.511
Yeah, me, too.
Behold, the holy grail.

18:56.594 --> 18:59.139
One nine-millimeter round
shot at Superman himself.

18:59.222 --> 19:00.265
It's legit.

19:00.348 --> 19:03.476
Probably worth, I don't know,
five, six hundred, maybe more.

19:03.560 --> 19:04.519
What's in the bag?

19:05.186 --> 19:06.271
Hey.

19:06.354 --> 19:08.690
Hey, it's all good.
It's good to maintain boundaries.

19:09.482 --> 19:12.402
You don't gotta talk so much,
you know.

19:13.320 --> 19:15.822
Anyway, this place is great.
You're gonna love it.

19:40.388 --> 19:41.765
Dinner!

19:49.105 --> 19:50.815
All hands on deck.

19:53.902 --> 19:55.779
Thank you for this family.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.030
Thank you for this day.

19:57.113 --> 20:01.034
Thank you for this food,
even if it's not steak filet.

20:04.454 --> 20:07.123
Big school.
2,000 students, you might think,

20:07.207 --> 20:08.750
"Wow, so many strangers."

20:08.833 --> 20:11.378
But not if you think of them
as possible future friends.

20:11.461 --> 20:13.880
Then it's,
"Wow, so many friends."

20:13.963 --> 20:16.925
The principal, her name's Shirley.
She's the best.

20:17.008 --> 20:18.802
Next.

20:18.927 --> 20:20.512
This is our security scanner.

20:20.595 --> 20:22.972
Like in an airport.
It's totally safe.

20:23.056 --> 20:24.516
I know what it is.

20:25.183 --> 20:27.143
- Does she always do this?
- Mmm-hmm.

20:27.227 --> 20:29.521
Silence makes me uncomfortable.

20:29.604 --> 20:32.065
She's almost never uncomfortable.

20:34.526 --> 20:35.926
Have a good first day, big brother.

20:35.985 --> 20:38.154
Look, you don't have to hug me
all the time.

20:38.238 --> 20:40.448
We're not actually
brother and sister, so...

20:42.325 --> 20:43.284
I'm sorry.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.581
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:49.290 --> 20:50.750
I didn't mean to make her...

20:53.920 --> 20:56.548
<i>I was overwhelmed, honestly.</i>

20:57.882 --> 21:01.302
<i>He said I must be pure of heart.</i>

21:01.386 --> 21:03.888
<i>He call himself a wizard.</i>

21:03.972 --> 21:08.309
<i>He even dressed like a wizard
from Harry Potter or some...</i>

21:09.644 --> 21:12.814
<i>But you're saying
that other people have experienced this?</i>

21:12.897 --> 21:16.609
In a sense, yes.
Do you remember what he said to you?

21:17.193 --> 21:18.778
<i>He tested me.</i>

21:19.821 --> 21:21.948
<i>There were these statues.</i>

21:22.657 --> 21:26.453
<i>Their eyes, it's like they were
looking at me, making me think things.</i>

21:26.536 --> 21:27.704
<i>Horrible things.</i>

21:28.329 --> 21:30.373
And do these approximate what you saw?

21:32.375 --> 21:35.420
<i>Yes, that's exactly how I remember it.</i>

21:36.004 --> 21:37.839
<i>I don't understand.
How do you know...</i>

21:37.922 --> 21:42.051
Recurrent imagery has proven very common
in cases of mass hysteria.

21:42.135 --> 21:43.303
<i>Mass hysteria?</i>

21:43.386 --> 21:46.014
I know. The term's a bit theatrical.

21:46.097 --> 21:48.850
But take UFO sightings, for example.

21:48.933 --> 21:51.436
Lights in the sky, flying saucers.

21:51.519 --> 21:54.355
Isolated incidents of people
who do not know each other...

21:54.439 --> 21:55.815
The symbols.

21:59.736 --> 22:01.070
Ask her about the symbols.

22:02.864 --> 22:06.993
Sorry, Ms. Kwan.
But as an example of recurrent imagery,

22:07.076 --> 22:08.953
maybe you'll recall seeing

22:09.037 --> 22:11.664
these symbols
before the alleged abduction.

22:12.624 --> 22:14.542
<i>I don't remember any symbols, no.</i>

22:15.460 --> 22:19.172
<i>I think I got it on video.
There was something, um...</i>

22:19.255 --> 22:21.257
<i>I remember the numbers
on my alarm clock.</i>

22:21.341 --> 22:22.592
<i>They kept shifting.</i>

22:22.675 --> 22:23.676
Video?

22:26.095 --> 22:27.222
Show me the video.

22:28.014 --> 22:30.225
Uh, Ms. Kwan, this is Dr. Sivana.

22:30.767 --> 22:33.561
Um, one moment, I can send it.

22:33.937 --> 22:37.357
<i>Hello? Oh, my God!</i>

22:37.440 --> 22:38.483
<i>Who's there?</i>

22:39.526 --> 22:42.487
<i>Hello? What's going on?
What's happening?</i>

22:44.322 --> 22:46.574
<i>I'm going to call the police!</i>

22:47.784 --> 22:50.328
<i>Then this blinding light all around me</i>

22:50.411 --> 22:52.664
<i>and I felt like I was getting
pulled down into something.</i>

22:52.747 --> 22:55.625
<i>It felt like a temple
carved inside a mountain.</i>

22:55.708 --> 22:58.576
<i>He looked exactly what you'd expect
from a guy who calls himself a wizard.</i>

22:58.586 --> 23:00.713
<i>and how you were brought there
to save the world.</i>

23:00.797 --> 23:02.757
<i>- Wearing</i> a <i>cape.
- And there's no ceiling.</i>

23:02.840 --> 23:04.050
We ran the numbers again...

23:04.133 --> 23:05.635
Dr. Sivana!

23:06.135 --> 23:11.057
I appreciate your enthusiasm,
but you're funding my project.

23:11.140 --> 23:14.143
And when I'm interviewing,
I don't wanna be interrupted.

23:14.227 --> 23:16.354
Fifty-six recorded abductions.

23:16.437 --> 23:17.689
- I never saw it.
- Saw what?

23:34.289 --> 23:35.415
Doctor, what is all this?

23:36.416 --> 23:38.418
All these years...

23:40.420 --> 23:44.424
I was convinced
I had the incorrect sequence.

23:44.507 --> 23:48.428
Or perhaps the wrong symbols

23:48.511 --> 23:50.096
to open the door.

23:51.639 --> 23:55.685
But on that woman's alarm clock,
the seven symbols.

23:57.687 --> 24:02.650
The sequence
repeated itself seven times.

24:04.777 --> 24:06.362
That's the difference.

24:06.446 --> 24:08.489
Is this some sort of joke?

24:08.573 --> 24:10.450
It may seem that way to you

24:10.533 --> 24:14.162
because we're not
in actuality studying mass hysteria.

24:14.787 --> 24:16.789
What all these people have seen,

24:17.624 --> 24:20.960
every single one of them,
is absolutely real.

24:21.169 --> 24:24.213
An alarm clock malfunctions

24:24.297 --> 24:27.300
and your first thought is
it's proof of a wizard?

24:27.467 --> 24:29.510
- Hmm.
- Come on, Dr. Sivana.

24:29.594 --> 24:32.013
You can't believe any of this is real.

24:44.901 --> 24:45.860
Why, yes.

24:52.200 --> 24:53.743
Yes, I do.

25:32.365 --> 25:36.869
I've been waiting for this moment
for so long...

25:38.162 --> 25:39.872
and now here we are.

25:40.623 --> 25:42.417
You don't remember me, do you?

25:49.090 --> 25:51.008
I remember you.

25:52.510 --> 25:54.095
You were a boy.

25:54.178 --> 25:56.180
And now you dare intrude in my kingdom.

25:56.264 --> 25:59.976
Do you know what it's like for a child
to be told you'll never be good enough?

26:00.560 --> 26:02.145
No, you don't.

26:02.228 --> 26:06.816
What you said to me all those years ago
made me realize who I really was.

26:06.899 --> 26:08.443
And you know something?

26:11.320 --> 26:13.406
I am not pure of heart.

26:14.031 --> 26:18.536
The wizard
is too weak to stop us.

26:20.913 --> 26:22.123
No!

26:22.206 --> 26:23.374
No!

26:32.258 --> 26:35.136
You never found your champion.

26:36.512 --> 26:39.474
But we found ours.

26:54.447 --> 26:58.618
You are the true champion.

27:30.191 --> 27:31.442
They're using you.

27:31.526 --> 27:34.195
You're nothing to them
but a means of escape.

27:40.743 --> 27:44.247
Through you, they'll spread their poison
to everything they touch!

27:44.956 --> 27:47.166
Make mankind turn on each other!

27:48.292 --> 27:50.670
You seek a pure soul, old man,

27:50.753 --> 27:52.922
but no one's worthy.

28:01.764 --> 28:04.642
Flight or invisibility?

28:05.852 --> 28:07.311
If you could have one superpower,

28:07.395 --> 28:09.355
flight or invisibility,
what would you pick?

28:09.438 --> 28:12.024
I mean, everybody chooses flight.
You know why?

28:12.108 --> 28:13.985
So they can fly away
from this conversation?

28:14.068 --> 28:15.486
No, no. 'Cause heroes fly.

28:15.570 --> 28:17.854
And who doesn't want people to think
they're a hero, right?

28:17.864 --> 28:20.032
But invisibility, no way.

28:20.116 --> 28:21.284
That's pervy.

28:21.367 --> 28:22.942
Spying around on people
who don't even know you're there.

28:22.952 --> 28:25.538
Sneaking around everywhere.
It's a total villain power, right?

28:33.129 --> 28:34.954
Then they did this study,
and this is a real thing.

28:34.964 --> 28:37.164
They asked people the same question.
You know, what power do you want?

28:37.174 --> 28:39.250
But this time, they made it
so the answers were anonymous.

28:39.260 --> 28:42.430
And most people, since they knew
that it was secret, said invisibility.

28:42.513 --> 28:43.838
And I think that's 'cause most people

28:43.848 --> 28:46.392
don't feel like heroes
on the inside, deep down.

28:46.475 --> 28:47.518
You're gonna run away.

28:48.603 --> 28:50.396
I mean, you stole my Superman bullet.

28:51.063 --> 28:53.024
Dude, I get it. I get it.

28:53.107 --> 28:54.682
You've been screwed over
way too many times.

28:54.692 --> 28:55.860
You don't trust anyone.

28:56.485 --> 29:00.156
That's the thing about invisibility.
You end up all by yourself.

29:01.449 --> 29:03.910
I didn't steal
your dumb bullet.

29:09.332 --> 29:11.250
Hey. How was it today?

29:12.209 --> 29:13.753
<i>That good, huh'?</i>

29:16.505 --> 29:18.883
Whoa!

29:19.300 --> 29:20.927
Oh, my God! Freddy.

29:21.010 --> 29:21.928
Are you okay?

29:22.011 --> 29:23.429
- You okay?
- Yes. Yes.

29:25.389 --> 29:26.307
What the hell?

29:26.390 --> 29:27.910
- What is wrong with you two?
- Oh, ho!

29:27.934 --> 29:30.019
No way that's gonna buff out.

29:30.102 --> 29:31.437
You gonna pay for that, Freeman?

29:31.520 --> 29:33.095
For the dent you made almost hitting me?

29:33.105 --> 29:34.190
Yeah, sure. Um...

29:34.273 --> 29:35.232
You guys take these?

29:39.904 --> 29:41.405
Brett, stop!

29:42.448 --> 29:43.741
Don't touch my brother!

29:43.824 --> 29:45.691
What, do you need your fake family
to stand up for you?

29:45.701 --> 29:47.501
- Stand up for yourself, Freeman.
- Yeah, huh?

29:47.536 --> 29:49.080
Hey, Freeman.
Freeman, here, stand up.

29:49.163 --> 29:50.247
Stand up for yourself.

29:50.331 --> 29:52.114
What are you gonna do,
go home and cry to Mommy?

29:52.124 --> 29:54.502
Oh, yeah.
You don't have a mommy.

29:56.504 --> 29:57.505
Hey.

30:00.758 --> 30:02.051
Man, sorry about that.

30:02.134 --> 30:04.845
That wasn't fair, but then again
you don't fight fair, so...

30:10.017 --> 30:12.478
Back off, assbags.
I know how to use these things.

30:18.734 --> 30:20.294
Hey! He's getting away!
Where you going?

30:21.112 --> 30:22.613
Freddy, are you okay?

30:24.532 --> 30:25.731
Hey, let's go through the back.

30:25.741 --> 30:26.784
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:34.959 --> 30:35.960
Nowhere to run!

30:36.043 --> 30:37.253
Hey!

30:37.336 --> 30:39.130
- Go, go, go!
- Grab him! Move!

30:39.213 --> 30:41.507
- Get out the way.
- Move, woman!

30:41.632 --> 30:42.633
Whoa!

30:44.093 --> 30:45.845
No, no, no.

30:46.012 --> 30:47.388
You're dead, kid.

30:47.471 --> 30:48.723
Yeah, you think you're funny.

30:48.806 --> 30:50.641
We know where you go to school, buddy!

30:53.227 --> 30:56.063
<i>Woman on PM Next stop,
30th Street Station.</i>

30:56.147 --> 30:58.065
<i>Change for the regional rail lines.</i>

31:17.084 --> 31:18.169
Uh... Hello?

31:19.295 --> 31:20.838
What's going on?

31:35.144 --> 31:36.145
Help!

31:50.743 --> 31:51.911
Okay.

32:07.635 --> 32:09.095
Holy moly.

32:25.528 --> 32:26.695
Hello?

32:41.627 --> 32:42.711
What the hell?

32:43.295 --> 32:44.880
Who's doing this?

33:16.662 --> 33:18.164
Hi. Um...

33:19.248 --> 33:21.750
I was supposed to get off at 30th.

33:21.834 --> 33:23.043
Billy Batson.

33:23.586 --> 33:24.795
How'd you know my name?

33:25.379 --> 33:28.632
I am the last of the Council of Wizards.

33:29.550 --> 33:31.886
Keeper of the Rock of Eternity.

33:32.595 --> 33:33.512
Oh...

33:34.054 --> 33:35.055
You're...

33:36.056 --> 33:37.558
that guy.

33:37.641 --> 33:39.393
Hey, listen, I don't have any money.

33:39.476 --> 33:41.478
Do not patronize me, boy.

33:43.856 --> 33:47.443
You are standing
in the source of all magic.

33:47.526 --> 33:52.656
The Rock of Eternity.
Seven thrones of seven wizards.

33:52.740 --> 33:56.243
But long ago, we chose a champion

33:56.327 --> 33:58.120
and we chose recklessly.

34:01.457 --> 34:04.668
He used his power for revenge,

34:04.752 --> 34:08.755
releasing the Seven Deadly Sins
into your world.

34:12.342 --> 34:15.094
Millions of lives were lost.

34:15.179 --> 34:19.558
Entire civilizations
erased from existence.

34:23.687 --> 34:27.358
That is why I vowed
never to pass on my magic

34:27.440 --> 34:31.654
until I find one truly good person.

34:32.529 --> 34:34.697
Strong in spirit,

34:34.782 --> 34:36.784
pure in heart.

34:37.409 --> 34:40.454
Look, man, maybe this is magic

34:41.246 --> 34:42.831
and, I don't know,

34:43.498 --> 34:46.043
but the people you're looking for,
good, pure people,

34:46.668 --> 34:47.920
I'm not one of them.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.755
I don't know if anyone is, really.

34:51.799 --> 34:54.342
You, Billy Batson,

34:55.219 --> 34:56.719
are all I have.

34:56.804 --> 34:59.014
All the world has.

35:01.100 --> 35:03.352
Lay your hands on my staff.

35:03.435 --> 35:04.478
Gross.

35:04.561 --> 35:08.148
And say my name
so my powers may flow through you.

35:08.232 --> 35:11.235
I open my heart to you, Billy Batson.

35:11.860 --> 35:15.447
And in so doing,
choose you as champion.

35:16.073 --> 35:17.157
Thanks.

35:17.241 --> 35:20.244
Real sweet of you, mister,
but I really gotta get going.

35:20.327 --> 35:23.914
My brothers and sisters
were slain by the Sins.

35:23.998 --> 35:26.750
Their thrones lie empty.

35:27.376 --> 35:30.045
My magic must be passed on.

35:30.129 --> 35:32.798
Now, speak my name!

35:33.465 --> 35:36.093
I don't know your name, sir.
We just met.

35:36.677 --> 35:38.762
My name is...

35:39.513 --> 35:41.098
Shazam.

35:43.225 --> 35:44.393
Wait, for real?

35:44.476 --> 35:46.103
- "Say it!
- OKay!"

35:46.687 --> 35:47.855
Jeez.

35:58.866 --> 36:00.993
So just say it'? Like...

36:02.119 --> 36:03.120
Shazam?

36:04.204 --> 36:05.247
Yes!

36:05.331 --> 36:08.709
Carry my name,
and with it, you carry all my powers.

36:08.792 --> 36:11.587
The wisdom of Solomon,
the strength of Hercules,

36:11.670 --> 36:14.965
the stamina of Atlas,
the power of Zeus,

36:15.049 --> 36:18.677
the courage of Achilles,
and the speed of Mercury.

36:29.104 --> 36:31.106
What happened to me? Why am...

36:31.190 --> 36:33.192
What did you do to me?
What did you do to my voice?

36:33.275 --> 36:36.945
You have been transformed
to your full potential, Billy Batson.

36:38.655 --> 36:41.825
With your heart,
unlock your greatest power.

36:42.534 --> 36:44.787
The thrones of
our brothers and sisters await.

36:57.049 --> 36:59.051
Get me outta here!

37:01.178 --> 37:02.805
Dope!

37:04.556 --> 37:07.393
My brother,
I applaud your choices today.

37:07.476 --> 37:10.229
Gold shoes, gold belt, white cape.

37:10.312 --> 37:13.649
It shouldn't work,
but hot damn, it does!

37:14.900 --> 37:15.818
Ow!

37:22.908 --> 37:24.076
Hey!

37:26.578 --> 37:27.996
Hey, babe!

37:34.378 --> 37:35.379
<i>Yes, Officer.</i>

37:35.462 --> 37:37.214
I'm aware he's run away in the past.

37:38.549 --> 37:39.800
Twenty-three times?

37:40.509 --> 37:43.971
Guy's got no social media presence.
At all.

37:44.054 --> 37:45.180
The guy is a ghost.

38:08.871 --> 38:10.706
You know, guys,
I'm happy to look for Billy.

38:10.789 --> 38:12.124
More than happy.

38:12.207 --> 38:14.751
But no, you gotta wash the dishes.
That's what's more important.

38:14.835 --> 38:16.410
"What are you gonna do,
Freddy, run after him?"

38:16.420 --> 38:18.672
Very funny.

38:19.715 --> 38:21.216
No, I said, don't scream.

38:21.300 --> 38:22.801
- Uh... Victor? Victor!
- No, no!

38:22.885 --> 38:24.261
- Victor!
- It's me. It's Billy.

38:24.344 --> 38:25.429
It's Billy!

38:25.512 --> 38:28.348
You asked me flight or invisibility.
I thought that was stupid,

38:28.432 --> 38:30.476
but now I look like this
and I need your help.

38:31.101 --> 38:32.769
Meet me back here after lights-out?

38:34.438 --> 38:35.731
'Sup, bud? You all right?

38:36.315 --> 38:39.067
Yeah. Yeah. I'm just...

38:39.735 --> 38:43.071
I'm really sad because Billy's gone.

38:43.155 --> 38:46.783
And, you know, maybe it's my fault.
Maybe I did it.

38:46.867 --> 38:48.577
Uh, you know, maybe I snore.

38:48.660 --> 38:51.163
Hey, hey, hey.
Not your fault, son, all right?

38:51.914 --> 38:53.332
We'll find him, 'kay?

38:53.916 --> 38:55.501
You don't snore that bad.

38:55.876 --> 38:57.628
But you kinda smell.

39:08.263 --> 39:10.307
Oh, thank God!

39:10.390 --> 39:12.518
Hey. Stop right there.

39:12.601 --> 39:14.968
How do I know you're not a supervillain
using telepathic abilities

39:14.978 --> 39:16.813
to make me believe
that you're Billy? Huh?

39:16.897 --> 39:17.856
What?

39:17.940 --> 39:19.181
All I have to do
is press "dial" on this thing.

39:19.191 --> 39:21.151
No! No., I have proof.
I have proof. Here.

39:22.736 --> 39:24.821
Look, I lied, okay?
I took your bullet.

39:24.905 --> 39:26.907
- Oh, no! No., no, no.
- No!

39:27.199 --> 39:29.326
Stupid adult hands.

39:29.409 --> 39:30.494
But you saw it.

39:30.577 --> 39:34.289
You saw it, right?
Look, Freddy, I swear. It's me, okay?

39:34.373 --> 39:36.281
Look, I know we're not really
close friends or anything,

39:36.291 --> 39:37.491
but you're the only person
that I know

39:37.501 --> 39:39.326
that knows anything about
this caped crusader stuff.

39:39.336 --> 39:41.171
- That's Batman.
- What?

39:42.256 --> 39:43.840
Forget it.

39:44.716 --> 39:45.842
Can l...

39:47.594 --> 39:48.929
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

39:57.229 --> 39:59.439
On... on, my God!

40:00.607 --> 40:01.775
It's crazy, right?

40:02.693 --> 40:03.860
What are your superpowers?

40:04.486 --> 40:06.926
Superpowers? Dude, I don't even know
how to pee in this thing.

40:07.239 --> 40:08.740
Okay. Can you fly?

40:11.076 --> 40:11.910
<i>Okay!</i>

40:11.994 --> 40:13.245
Let's do this.

40:13.787 --> 40:14.746
How do we do this?

40:15.539 --> 40:18.041
Just, um, like, Superman it.

40:21.420 --> 40:23.171
Oh, my God.
Obviously, you have to jump.

40:23.255 --> 40:24.089
Come on.

40:24.673 --> 40:26.216
How is any of this obvious?

40:26.300 --> 40:27.384
Okay.

40:27.968 --> 40:30.804
Try, uh, to believe
that you can fly. Okay?

40:30.887 --> 40:32.222
I read this deep dive

40:32.306 --> 40:33.922
into peer-reviewed studies
about superpowers

40:33.932 --> 40:36.852
and in six out of ten,
belief is the key.

40:36.935 --> 40:39.396
Belief. Belief. Belief. Okay. Okay.
I believe I can fly.

40:39.479 --> 40:41.231
I believe I...

40:41.356 --> 40:43.025
I believe I can fly.

40:43.108 --> 40:44.276
I believe...

40:48.780 --> 40:51.325
Whoa!

40:52.451 --> 40:54.161
Did you believe?

40:57.080 --> 40:57.998
Yeah.

40:58.665 --> 41:00.042
You wanna try invisibility?

41:01.585 --> 41:02.753
How do I do...

41:02.836 --> 41:04.379
Forget it. You know, okay.

41:04.463 --> 41:06.173
Okay, okay, okay.

41:09.259 --> 41:11.261
Oh, my God! It worked!

41:11.845 --> 41:12.846
Where'd you go?

41:14.181 --> 41:15.464
I'm right here. You can't see me?

41:15.474 --> 41:16.600
Where?

41:16.850 --> 41:19.019
I'm invisible!

41:19.102 --> 41:20.187
I'm right here. Over here.

41:22.731 --> 41:24.650
I'm invisible! I'm invisible!

41:24.733 --> 41:25.692
Hey!

41:25.776 --> 41:27.194
Nice outfit, dipshit.

41:29.446 --> 41:31.490
I might've been
testing invisibility

41:31.573 --> 41:33.533
and super-intelligence at the same time.

41:33.617 --> 41:35.827
Freeman, I'm gonna come over there
and beat you.

41:43.794 --> 41:45.921
Oh, my God!
The lightning emblem!

41:46.004 --> 41:48.382
It was staring us right in the face
the whole time.

41:49.549 --> 41:50.592
Literally!

41:58.892 --> 41:59.851
Okay, okay.

41:59.935 --> 42:01.718
Clearly, we gotta give you
a lightning-themed superhero name.

42:01.728 --> 42:02.896
Yeah.

42:14.199 --> 42:15.158
Oh, right.

42:15.242 --> 42:16.118
Hey, yo! Back...

42:18.245 --> 42:19.287
off.

42:19.371 --> 42:22.249
Hyper-speed, check.

42:23.333 --> 42:25.335
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

42:25.419 --> 42:27.035
I thought you were the one
who was screaming.

42:27.045 --> 42:28.285
I doused him with pepper spray.

42:28.797 --> 42:29.840
Smart move.

42:29.923 --> 42:33.552
Yeah, hey, Mr. Mugger Guy.
Give the old lady her purse back.

42:33.635 --> 42:35.011
I'm your age.

42:35.095 --> 42:37.856
And he didn't get a chance to take it
'cause I didn't let him take it.

42:38.223 --> 42:40.600
Good. Yeah, good.
You're really on top of this stuff.

42:40.684 --> 42:42.561
And that should teach you
that old ladies...

42:42.644 --> 42:46.606
Regular-aged ladies like yourself
don't need your protecting, right?

42:46.690 --> 42:47.941
So get woke, bro.

42:48.024 --> 42:49.401
I'm sorry, who are you?

42:49.484 --> 42:52.362
His name is Thundercrack,

42:52.446 --> 42:56.116
hero to the people with all the
power and speed of lightning all in one.

42:56.199 --> 42:57.639
Dude, that sounds like a butt thing.

42:59.578 --> 43:00.704
Mister Philadelphia.

43:00.787 --> 43:02.147
That's a cream cheese thing, dude!

43:02.164 --> 43:03.613
Power Boy.
'Cause he's got all the powers.

43:03.623 --> 43:06.209
'Cause sometimes pepper spray
can't protect against evil.

43:06.793 --> 43:08.628
Power Boy, do you know this child?

43:11.047 --> 43:13.925
Like a teeny little bit.
I don't really know...

43:14.009 --> 43:15.689
Yeah. He's like
a little miniature manager.

43:15.761 --> 43:17.721
I'm his manager.

43:17.888 --> 43:20.380
But Power Boy's not gonna work,
either, okay? So work on something else.

43:20.390 --> 43:21.850
Hey, bud, what could...

43:26.938 --> 43:29.983
Electricity manipulation, hyper-speed,
super-strength.

43:30.066 --> 43:31.276
Dude, you're stacked!

43:31.359 --> 43:33.195
You're almost as cool as Superman.
Almost.

43:33.278 --> 43:35.395
I didn't see you.
I don't know what just happened here.

43:35.405 --> 43:37.365
I don't wanna know.
Just don't hurt me.

43:37.449 --> 43:39.065
- I'm not doing it for the money.
- Thank you for your kind donation.

43:39.075 --> 43:40.525
No, no, no, but if you
ever need any more help

43:40.535 --> 43:43.622
just look for the superhero
that still can't fly.

43:43.705 --> 43:46.583
Forget flying, man.
We just made 73 bucks!

43:46.666 --> 43:48.293
Seventy-three bucks?

43:48.460 --> 43:49.961
Come on!

43:50.837 --> 43:52.047
Hey, wait a minute.

43:52.839 --> 43:54.132
I just got an idea.

43:55.383 --> 43:57.844
I'd like to purchase
some of your finest beer, please.

44:17.197 --> 44:19.606
I don't know about this.
I mean, we don't have a fake ID even.

44:19.616 --> 44:21.493
Freddy, Freddy, would you relax?

44:21.576 --> 44:24.329
Look at me. I am the fake ID.

44:24.412 --> 44:25.529
Everything from the register!

44:25.539 --> 44:27.332
Go, go! Now!

44:27.415 --> 44:29.295
Come on! We don't have any time.
Let's go. Move!

44:29.876 --> 44:31.211
We want it all! Hurry.

44:31.294 --> 44:32.546
This is your chance.

44:33.213 --> 44:34.673
Oh! Okay.

44:36.132 --> 44:38.176
Come on, come on, come on!
Let's do this!

44:39.052 --> 44:40.011
That's it. That's it.

44:41.930 --> 44:42.931
Gentlemen,

44:43.014 --> 44:45.767
why use guns
when we can handle this like real men?

44:48.186 --> 44:49.563
Billy, look out!

45:02.117 --> 45:04.828
Bullet immunity.
You have bullet immunity!

45:04.911 --> 45:06.371
I'm bulletproof.

45:07.998 --> 45:10.292
Today is December 8th,

45:10.375 --> 45:12.669
and this is video proof of authenticity.

45:13.962 --> 45:15.005
Shoot him again.

45:15.088 --> 45:17.132
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Here, here.
Go. Both of you!

45:17.215 --> 45:18.508
Come on. Go to town.

45:25.140 --> 45:26.600
Wait, wait, wait.

45:26.683 --> 45:28.727
We still don't know if
the suit is bulletproof,

45:28.810 --> 45:30.353
or if you are.

45:31.396 --> 45:32.355
Shoot him in the face.

45:32.439 --> 45:34.316
Shoot me in the face.
In the face?

45:42.240 --> 45:43.325
It kinda tickles.

45:44.910 --> 45:45.744
You're dead.

45:51.583 --> 45:53.325
- Sorry about your window.
- Have a good night!

45:53.335 --> 45:55.086
But you're welcome
for not getting robbed!

45:55.712 --> 45:58.798
Come on! Let's get outta here.

45:58.882 --> 46:00.175
Hey.

46:00.258 --> 46:02.052
- To fighting bad guys.
- Yeah.

46:03.970 --> 46:05.096
Bleh!

46:05.889 --> 46:07.098
Ugh!

46:07.223 --> 46:08.808
That tastes like actual vomit.

46:10.602 --> 46:12.854
Hey, do you know habanero jerky,

46:12.938 --> 46:15.732
if you eat enough of it,
it can burn a hole in your stomach?

46:15.815 --> 46:16.900
Worth it.

46:16.983 --> 46:19.861
Yeah. Probably not you, though.
You've probably got stomach superpowers.

46:19.945 --> 46:21.363
Probably. Oh, hey.

46:21.446 --> 46:22.572
What's up? I'm a superhero.

46:22.656 --> 46:24.282
Yeah, his name is, uh,

46:24.366 --> 46:25.825
Captain Sparklefingers.

46:25.909 --> 46:28.036
No, it's not.
No, it's not! That's not my name.

46:28.119 --> 46:30.497
Hey, we should hang out.
We're, like, the same age.

46:30.580 --> 46:32.165
Oh, okay. I'm out.

46:32.248 --> 46:33.458
Hey, wait up!

46:40.006 --> 46:42.550
I mean,
it's a pretty sick view.

46:42.634 --> 46:45.720
I totally get why Rocky
was training so hard to get up here.

46:48.056 --> 46:50.392
You know, I like you like this.
This is so cool.

46:51.434 --> 46:53.061
I mean, no offense,

46:53.144 --> 46:57.732
but, like, at first you were kinda like
the opposite of how Darla is.

46:59.442 --> 47:00.527
A dick?

47:00.610 --> 47:02.904
Your words. Not mine.

47:02.988 --> 47:04.406
But yeah.

47:05.949 --> 47:07.607
All right, well,
I feel like every criminal

47:07.617 --> 47:09.619
is either on drugs or asleep by now.

47:09.703 --> 47:10.996
Wanna head home?

47:12.163 --> 47:13.415
Looking like this?

47:13.498 --> 47:14.374
Well, yeah,

47:14.457 --> 47:17.836
I mean, usually,
we'd have a lair to go back to,

47:17.919 --> 47:19.295
but that's long-term.

47:20.005 --> 47:22.507
Right now, we have a bunk bed.

47:26.511 --> 47:29.180
Just scares me thinking of him out there
all alone.

47:29.264 --> 47:31.182
This is what he does, Rosa.

47:32.434 --> 47:36.938
Difference is, when they find him,
we'll be the first to take him back.

47:37.022 --> 47:38.356
With open arms.

47:41.401 --> 47:44.029
Didn't even make it two days.
Not even two days.

47:44.112 --> 47:46.322
Baby, we did our fair share
of running off back when.

47:46.906 --> 47:48.033
At least I did.

47:48.867 --> 47:51.036
- Yeah.
- Even Mary did it.

47:51.119 --> 47:52.412
Hmm? Twice.

47:54.456 --> 47:56.332
That second time she ran off,

47:56.416 --> 47:58.668
you said something to me
I'll never forget.

47:59.252 --> 48:00.503
You said,

48:00.587 --> 48:02.839
"It's not a home
until you call it a home.

48:02.922 --> 48:04.632
It's something you choose."

48:07.552 --> 48:10.305
All we can do is give him
a place full of love.

48:11.097 --> 48:14.350
Whether he chooses to call it a home,
that's up to him.

48:16.227 --> 48:17.812
Yeah.

48:19.606 --> 48:20.926
You gonna help me with this tree?

48:22.567 --> 48:24.194
This tree's so sad.

48:26.321 --> 48:27.739
Hello?

48:27.822 --> 48:29.365
Got lost finding the bathroom.

48:29.949 --> 48:31.701
Oh, okay, Freddy, sweetie. Good night.

48:31.785 --> 48:32.786
- Good night.
- Night.

48:35.330 --> 48:36.414
Freddy, who is that?

48:36.498 --> 48:39.417
It's Billy. He's just really tired
and he has laryngitis.

48:39.501 --> 48:40.627
What? Laryngitis!

48:40.710 --> 48:41.868
I'm just kidding! I'm just kidding.

48:41.878 --> 48:43.411
He's really, really tired,
and he wants to go to beddy-bye.

48:43.421 --> 48:45.715
- Beddy-bye? Who says beddy-bye?
- Just hide, hide.

48:45.799 --> 48:47.258
Billy, you're back. Let us see you.

48:48.384 --> 48:49.664
We've been so worried about you.

48:50.720 --> 48:52.430
I told you this was a bad idea!

48:52.514 --> 48:54.057
Freddy?

48:55.100 --> 48:56.500
Freddy,
what happened to the stairs?

48:57.393 --> 48:58.394
Mmm!

48:58.478 --> 49:00.303
Hey! Covering her mouth
like you're gonna kidnap her

49:00.313 --> 49:01.913
is not gonna make her less scared, okay?

49:04.651 --> 49:06.903
Darla, it's me. It's Billy.
I know I don't look like me.

49:06.986 --> 49:08.686
- A wizard made me look like this.
- Maybe don't start with "wizard."

49:08.696 --> 49:10.105
It's just gonna make her more confused.

49:10.115 --> 49:13.201
Some old guy brought me to a temple
and he made me say, "Shazam."

49:15.036 --> 49:15.912
Rosa!

49:16.871 --> 49:19.040
Verbally triggered
body-manipulation properties!

49:19.124 --> 49:20.524
You can switch by saying, "Shazam."

49:23.336 --> 49:25.588
Baby, was that you?
Are you okay?

49:25.797 --> 49:26.673
Uh...

49:27.215 --> 49:29.092
I was screwing in a bulb.

49:29.843 --> 49:32.595
Listen to me, Darla. You cannot tell
anybody about this, all right?

49:32.679 --> 49:34.764
But it's Billy. He's a hero.

49:34.848 --> 49:36.256
Yeah, but if a supervillain finds out
that he's a hero,

49:36.266 --> 49:37.517
that endangers us, okay?

49:37.600 --> 49:40.812
A hero's loved ones are
the perfect bad guy target.

49:40.895 --> 49:42.428
I mean, is she even good
at keeping secrets?

49:42.438 --> 49:44.023
- Moderate.
- No.

49:44.107 --> 49:45.066
Oh, God.

49:45.150 --> 49:46.359
Okay, listen, D,

49:46.442 --> 49:49.070
you cannot tell a single soul
about this, all right? Please?

49:49.154 --> 49:51.781
Why? What if it's people we trust?

49:54.826 --> 49:56.828
Because good sisters don't tell secrets.

49:56.911 --> 49:59.414
- I'm a good sister.
- Yeah, you are.

49:59.497 --> 50:01.239
You know what'd make you
an even better sister?

50:01.249 --> 50:02.448
Is if you fixed the doorknob
for us, okay?

50:02.458 --> 50:03.418
Yeah.

50:03.501 --> 50:05.503
- Sweet dreams.
- Sweet dreams. Bye.

50:05.587 --> 50:07.107
- See you in the morning.
- Good night.

50:12.594 --> 50:14.387
Hello, sir. How may I help you?

50:14.470 --> 50:15.805
Hi. Sir?

50:16.890 --> 50:19.142
Sir, you can't go in there.
Excuse me!

50:19.225 --> 50:21.269
You cannot go in there!

50:25.481 --> 50:26.482
Sorry I'm late.

50:26.566 --> 50:28.943
Thad, this is for board members only.

50:29.027 --> 50:30.403
I'm aware of that, Father.

50:34.240 --> 50:38.661
Now, that night in the car.

50:39.370 --> 50:43.374
I swore to you I saw something,
but you never believed me.

50:43.458 --> 50:46.669
So much easier to blame me, wasn't it?

50:47.253 --> 50:49.797
And say that if I hadn't screamed
that night,

50:49.881 --> 50:51.299
you'd still have your legs.

50:52.467 --> 50:54.761
Well, now I have proof.

50:57.347 --> 50:58.890
That's enough, Thad.

50:58.973 --> 51:01.809
Dear Sid, you think?

51:03.144 --> 51:07.273
You know, even before the accident,
you belittled me.

51:07.357 --> 51:09.776
Don't make me
throw you outta here, Thad.

51:10.360 --> 51:12.570
You don't need to make a scene.

51:12.654 --> 51:14.113
Oh, brother,

51:14.197 --> 51:16.616
the scene has only just begun.

51:20.161 --> 51:21.871
Ask that if you can throw me out.

51:21.955 --> 51:23.081
What?

51:23.164 --> 51:25.708
Ask the ball if you're man enough
to throw me out of this room.

51:30.129 --> 51:31.464
Let me spoil it for you.

51:39.973 --> 51:43.309
Outlook not so good.

51:45.520 --> 51:49.899
I've come here during
the season of giving to give you...

51:53.695 --> 51:55.363
what you deserve.

52:08.960 --> 52:09.919
Run!

52:52.628 --> 52:54.881
Oh, my God! No!

52:54.964 --> 52:57.133
No! No!

53:12.482 --> 53:13.816
Help!

53:13.900 --> 53:15.651
Somebody!

53:15.735 --> 53:18.404
Help me!

53:18.488 --> 53:20.615
You can't go crying to other people
all the time.

53:22.658 --> 53:25.578
What sin best befits you, Father? Hmm?

53:26.204 --> 53:27.789
I'll give you anything.

53:28.414 --> 53:29.957
Money.

53:30.041 --> 53:31.626
The company.
You want the company?

53:32.293 --> 53:33.503
There it is.

53:35.296 --> 53:36.506
Greed.

53:37.090 --> 53:38.674
Do you honestly think

53:39.801 --> 53:43.679
all this material you've accumulated

53:45.181 --> 53:47.183
amounts to actual power?

53:49.769 --> 53:52.522
This is power.

53:54.190 --> 53:55.817
More than you ever had.

53:56.943 --> 53:58.569
More than anyone has.

53:59.821 --> 54:03.324
There is one more powerful.

54:03.408 --> 54:07.787
The wizard found his champion.

54:07.870 --> 54:13.501
Kill the champion
before he learns his true potential,

54:13.584 --> 54:16.712
or he will defeat you.

54:16.796 --> 54:18.673
Show me where to find him.

54:33.688 --> 54:35.148
Oh, Greed,

54:36.858 --> 54:38.192
you can have him.

54:39.402 --> 54:40.486
No.

54:40.570 --> 54:43.573
No.. Oh, no!

54:45.158 --> 54:47.910
No! No! No!

55:05.887 --> 55:08.848
<i>Family is more than just a word.</i>

55:10.141 --> 55:14.145
<i>At Sivana Industries,
our focus is family.</i>

55:38.503 --> 55:40.254
Uh, Burke.

55:42.548 --> 55:44.217
Where's the truck?

55:53.226 --> 55:54.310
I can hear it.

56:04.695 --> 56:06.280
Oh, my God!

56:06.364 --> 56:07.907
My truck!

56:07.990 --> 56:09.450
- My truck!
- Are you kidding?

56:10.618 --> 56:11.953
You know, guys,

56:12.703 --> 56:14.497
I don't think that's gonna buff out.

56:23.297 --> 56:24.215
Hey.

56:24.298 --> 56:26.801
Making the crippled kid
do the dirty work. Wow!

56:26.926 --> 56:28.928
I'm a better lookout.
I can play innocent.

56:29.011 --> 56:30.263
And I can't?

56:31.389 --> 56:34.976
Your face gives off a very strong vibe
of someone who's hatching schemes.

56:35.059 --> 56:37.478
- My face? This face?
- Yeah. Yeah.

56:37.562 --> 56:38.563
Okay.

56:44.527 --> 56:45.945
You boys got a hall pass?

56:46.696 --> 56:49.031
Oh, us? Yeah. Always.

56:49.699 --> 56:50.908
You!

56:53.494 --> 56:55.246
You look like you're up to something.

56:55.329 --> 56:56.706
Me? Up to something?

56:56.789 --> 56:58.833
No. Never am I up to something.

56:58.916 --> 57:02.086
Our dad's picking us up.
He got held up at the...

57:02.169 --> 57:04.005
The business office.

57:04.088 --> 57:05.631
The business office, huh?

57:06.340 --> 57:07.466
Sure, kid.

57:07.550 --> 57:09.635
Look, parents or guardians

57:09.719 --> 57:12.972
must appear physically
to check out students.

57:13.723 --> 57:15.182
Gotcha.

57:15.266 --> 57:17.184
Okay, well, you hear that, Dad?

57:17.268 --> 57:18.644
- Hey!
- Shazam!

57:18.728 --> 57:20.563
Well, hey there, son,

57:20.646 --> 57:22.398
and hey there,
other son that I also have

57:22.481 --> 57:24.557
that's related to that son
I just passed in the hallway.

57:24.567 --> 57:28.946
I'm so sorry I'm late.
I got held up at the business office,

57:29.989 --> 57:31.157
doing all the work stuff.

57:31.240 --> 57:35.036
This is the security guard
all the kids admire so much.

57:35.161 --> 57:36.078
Oh.

57:36.203 --> 57:38.043
Actually, that's the other one.
This one sucks.

57:38.289 --> 57:40.291
That's not funny.

57:40.374 --> 57:43.461
I'm gonna talk to him about that.
I apologize.

57:43.544 --> 57:46.380
Anyway, this is me appearing physically
to check my sons out of school.

57:46.464 --> 57:50.843
So, thank you so much
for keeping 'em safe, Detective Moron.

57:53.888 --> 57:55.056
It's Moran.

57:56.140 --> 57:57.767
- You ready?
- Algebra!

57:58.934 --> 58:00.311
Science!

58:01.103 --> 58:02.396
English!

58:04.649 --> 58:05.941
Health!

58:17.912 --> 58:18.829
Oh. Oh.

58:38.599 --> 58:39.809
Are you okay?

59:17.722 --> 59:19.432
I'm sorry!

59:42.496 --> 59:44.415
More powerful than a locomotive.

59:44.498 --> 59:46.876
Locomotive.
What are you? An old prospector?

59:47.918 --> 59:50.129
Can leap tall buildings
in a single bound.

59:54.258 --> 59:55.217
Single bound.

59:57.887 --> 59:59.472
Oh!

59:59.555 --> 01:00:00.723
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!

01:00:00.806 --> 01:00:01.932
I'm sorry, people. Hi.

01:00:02.016 --> 01:00:03.184
- Your phone's charged.
- Wow!

01:00:03.267 --> 01:00:04.894
Your phone's charged.

01:00:04.977 --> 01:00:06.103
Your phone's charged.

01:00:06.187 --> 01:00:09.565
You really need like a mic drop
catchphrase after you do some cool shit.

01:00:09.648 --> 01:00:11.025
I've been thinking about that.

01:00:11.108 --> 01:00:12.443
What about this?

01:00:12.526 --> 01:00:15.196
"That's why you don't mess
with electricity."

01:00:15.362 --> 01:00:17.271
Catchphrases obviously
aren't one of your superpowers.

01:00:17.281 --> 01:00:18.908
And your phone's charged.

01:00:18.991 --> 01:00:21.071
- Well, you think you can do better?
- What the hell?

01:00:21.494 --> 01:00:23.579
Let there be light.

01:00:26.999 --> 01:00:29.043
Yeah, yeah, baby. Yeah, baby, okay.

01:00:34.215 --> 01:00:35.674
How do I... Never mind.

01:00:35.758 --> 01:00:36.759
Shazam!

01:00:40.596 --> 01:00:41.680
Shazam!

01:00:50.940 --> 01:00:52.640
What'd you see? What'd you see?
Were there boobies?

01:00:52.650 --> 01:00:54.693
You see nipples? Why aren't you talking?

01:00:56.445 --> 01:00:57.520
We're gonna need more money.

01:00:57.530 --> 01:00:59.021
Why? You were in there
for, like, five minutes.

01:00:59.031 --> 01:01:00.533
Dude, they were very convincing!

01:01:05.913 --> 01:01:06.914
Oh, get it, get it!

01:01:08.874 --> 01:01:09.875
Go, go, go!

01:01:15.798 --> 01:01:16.882
No!

01:01:17.550 --> 01:01:19.051
Stop! No!

01:01:19.134 --> 01:01:20.251
- I'm not even looking!
- Stop!

01:01:20.261 --> 01:01:22.555
- I'm not even looking! Oh!
- Stop!

01:01:22.638 --> 01:01:24.431
- Why?
- Oh, and done!

01:01:24.515 --> 01:01:25.933
Finished him.

01:01:29.812 --> 01:01:31.355
A lair.

01:01:31.438 --> 01:01:32.565
Yes.

01:01:32.648 --> 01:01:33.722
And obviously, we're gonna have to

01:01:33.732 --> 01:01:35.492
- be making this purchase anonymously.
- Mmm.

01:01:35.943 --> 01:01:37.069
Obviously.

01:01:37.152 --> 01:01:40.072
And, um,
if you have a location on a cliff.

01:01:40.155 --> 01:01:41.782
Like a castle-esque type thing.

01:01:41.866 --> 01:01:43.607
- Overlooking some water.
- Overlooking some water,

01:01:43.617 --> 01:01:45.369
seas, below it. Rough, you know...

01:01:45.452 --> 01:01:46.662
Like a waterfall,

01:01:46.745 --> 01:01:49.113
- so you can drive into...
- Waterfall, yeah. If you... Yeah.

01:01:49.123 --> 01:01:51.584
Look, Maximum Voltage, is it?

01:01:51.667 --> 01:01:53.752
You can call me Max.

01:01:53.836 --> 01:01:57.298
Look, Max, why don't you just start with
how many bedrooms you're looking for?

01:01:57.381 --> 01:01:58.549
- One!
- Seven.

01:01:58.632 --> 01:01:59.800
- One?
- Seven?

01:01:59.884 --> 01:02:01.364
What, am I running a foster home now?

01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:15.472
Have you seen the one
where he throws the football into space?

01:02:15.482 --> 01:02:16.482
So dope.

01:02:16.525 --> 01:02:18.525
Hey, you guys
gotta wonder who's filming those, right?

01:02:18.527 --> 01:02:20.863
I mean, that's bravery in and of itself.

01:02:20.946 --> 01:02:22.156
I mean, is it, though?

01:02:22.239 --> 01:02:24.533
Yeah. I'd actually argue
maybe even more brave.

01:02:24.617 --> 01:02:25.618
Holding a camera?

01:02:26.076 --> 01:02:28.621
Staring in the face of danger.

01:02:28.704 --> 01:02:30.080
Like some weirdo fanboy.

01:02:31.707 --> 01:02:32.875
Hey, Freeman.

01:02:32.958 --> 01:02:34.919
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

01:02:35.002 --> 01:02:38.005
What, is your bestie gonna hit us
with a wheelchair this time?

01:02:38.088 --> 01:02:39.580
No, maybe not him,
but I have another best friend

01:02:39.590 --> 01:02:41.470
who might hunt you down
and destroy both of you.

01:02:42.134 --> 01:02:43.260
Okay, Freddy.

01:02:43.344 --> 01:02:46.597
You may have heard of him.
The Human Power Storm.

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:48.933
Frequency Flinger. Sir Zaps-A-Lot.

01:02:49.016 --> 01:02:50.768
Yeah. He's a man of many names.

01:02:50.851 --> 01:02:52.019
You know the Red Cyclone?

01:02:52.102 --> 01:02:54.855
You? My ass you do.

01:02:54.939 --> 01:02:56.774
Oh, we're a lot closer than you think.

01:02:56.857 --> 01:02:58.817
Maybe even at this very moment.

01:02:58.901 --> 01:03:00.110
Prove it.

01:03:00.194 --> 01:03:03.030
I will, tomorrow.
Tomorrow he's gonna come to lunch.

01:03:03.113 --> 01:03:04.490
Right, right, Billy?

01:03:04.573 --> 01:03:07.173
Oh, yeah, and then Superman's
gonna be bringing us dessert, right?

01:03:10.245 --> 01:03:11.789
Tomorrow at lunch. You'll see.

01:03:12.373 --> 01:03:15.501
And when he doesn't show,
then we'll kick your ass.

01:03:18.170 --> 01:03:21.590
So, wait, my identity's a secret
so no one I know can get hurt.

01:03:22.299 --> 01:03:25.135
Except when it makes you look cool,
then it's all good.

01:03:25.219 --> 01:03:26.752
Billy, it's not like
they're supervillains.

01:03:26.762 --> 01:03:28.764
They're just super douchebags.

01:03:28.847 --> 01:03:31.183
So, you're breaking your own rule?

01:03:31.266 --> 01:03:32.267
Got it.

01:03:33.102 --> 01:03:35.729
This thing is as much as mine
as it is yours.

01:03:36.897 --> 01:03:39.483
Starting to think
you think it's all your thing.

01:03:39.566 --> 01:03:41.860
Billy, you're still gonna do it,
though, right?

01:03:41.944 --> 01:03:43.946
I mean, what would a good brother do?

01:03:45.614 --> 01:03:47.032
All hands on deck.

01:03:50.452 --> 01:03:53.539
Thank you for this family.
Thank you for this day.

01:03:53.622 --> 01:03:57.001
Thank you for this food.
Sorry Billy's hand's on vacay.

01:04:01.088 --> 01:04:03.465
Big news in Philly. Got a costumed hero.

01:04:04.049 --> 01:04:05.053
He's doing good.

01:04:05.092 --> 01:04:06.677
Yeah, but is he, though?

01:04:07.386 --> 01:04:10.264
Ooh! Controversy. Into it.

01:04:10.347 --> 01:04:13.726
Share with us your perspective, Eugene.

01:04:13.809 --> 01:04:16.687
Just saying, he's what?
Charging people's phones?

01:04:16.770 --> 01:04:19.606
So what?
I can charge a phone with a plug.

01:04:19.690 --> 01:04:20.649
Preach.

01:04:21.483 --> 01:04:23.610
Pedro, any thoughts?

01:04:24.319 --> 01:04:26.155
Costume's stupid.

01:04:26.363 --> 01:04:27.531
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:04:27.614 --> 01:04:29.742
Big white cape like
he's getting married or something.

01:04:29.825 --> 01:04:32.077
What if he didn't get
to pick his costume?

01:04:32.161 --> 01:04:34.329
Ever think about that?

01:04:34.413 --> 01:04:36.253
You're a specialist, Freddy.
What do you think?

01:04:36.331 --> 01:04:40.335
Yeah, Freddy,
let's manage to see the positive.

01:04:40.419 --> 01:04:42.337
Okay, Well, I think it looks like

01:04:42.421 --> 01:04:44.421
he doesn't have gratitude
for what he's been given.

01:04:44.757 --> 01:04:47.092
Very specific. All right.

01:04:47.176 --> 01:04:48.427
Maybe to the superhero,

01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:50.190
gratitude doesn't mean
having to be clingy.

01:04:50.262 --> 01:04:51.638
Clingy? Wow, interesting take.

01:04:51.722 --> 01:04:55.976
You know, maybe sometimes
a superhero just wants a little me time.

01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:59.188
You know, me time could also
be construed as pushing away his family.

01:04:59.271 --> 01:05:01.231
Family. Is that what they are now?

01:05:01.315 --> 01:05:03.400
It's a classic symptom of
"Superhero Syndrome."

01:05:03.484 --> 01:05:07.029
Coined by German psychologist
Heinrich Von German-something,

01:05:07.112 --> 01:05:10.282
where superpowers become
an all-consuming narcotic.

01:05:11.617 --> 01:05:13.577
Son, we're still eating dinner.

01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:15.412
What he needs is a sidekick.

01:05:15.496 --> 01:05:17.039
Name one cool sidekick.

01:05:18.207 --> 01:05:20.375
Darla, why are you
so quiet over there, baby?

01:05:20.459 --> 01:05:22.544
You're never at a loss for words.

01:05:22.628 --> 01:05:24.213
I'm eating.

01:05:35.015 --> 01:05:36.642
Why am I still doing this?

01:05:37.017 --> 01:05:38.936
Well, you can't skip every day.

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:40.771
Not at your age.

01:05:41.647 --> 01:05:43.107
But I'm not your age anymore.

01:05:43.857 --> 01:05:45.109
But I can go with you.

01:05:45.192 --> 01:05:47.778
We just gotta trick the guard out,
you know?

01:05:47.861 --> 01:05:49.738
Billy, where are you going?

01:05:49.822 --> 01:05:51.230
You're still gonna have
lunch with me, right?

01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:52.199
Billy!

01:05:52.741 --> 01:05:56.120
Sir Zaps-A-Lot's
still gonna eat in the cafeteria, right?

01:06:05.921 --> 01:06:07.548
All right.

01:06:07.631 --> 01:06:09.466
Did you check it to...

01:06:09.550 --> 01:06:13.262
People typically give me
a little money, you know...

01:06:13.345 --> 01:06:15.556
You're a sweet couple.
You guys have a good day.

01:06:25.357 --> 01:06:27.484
Ooh!

01:06:27.651 --> 01:06:29.945
- Oh, my God.
- Mary, are you okay?

01:06:30.487 --> 01:06:31.447
How do you know my name?

01:06:31.613 --> 01:06:33.657
Uh... How do I know your name? Uh...

01:06:34.658 --> 01:06:36.869
One of my superpowers is name guessing.

01:06:37.411 --> 01:06:39.329
Which is really weird, I bet.

01:06:39.413 --> 01:06:41.957
Uh, it's not as cool as
super-strength or super-speed,

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:44.168
but it's really helpful
when I meet new people.

01:06:44.793 --> 01:06:45.669
Are you hurt?

01:06:46.295 --> 01:06:50.007
No, I'm okay. Thank you. Um...

01:06:51.967 --> 01:06:54.428
I just need a second to think.

01:06:54.511 --> 01:06:56.054
This has been such a weird day.

01:06:56.889 --> 01:07:00.434
Um, using my powers
of super-observation,

01:07:00.517 --> 01:07:03.937
I see that you're holding
a letter from a college in your hand.

01:07:04.021 --> 01:07:06.607
Are you upset because you didn't get in?

01:07:10.152 --> 01:07:11.111
I got in.

01:07:13.739 --> 01:07:17.868
Well, now my superpowers
are failing me and I am very confused.

01:07:18.952 --> 01:07:20.704
Yeah. Me, too.

01:07:21.705 --> 01:07:23.197
I don't know. I know I should be excited

01:07:23.207 --> 01:07:26.418
'cause this is my dream and I've worked
really, really hard for this,

01:07:27.294 --> 01:07:28.420
but it's like...

01:07:31.089 --> 01:07:33.592
I don't know. Leaving my family
does not feel fun, you know?

01:07:33.675 --> 01:07:36.762
Could I give you
a little piece of advice?

01:07:36.845 --> 01:07:40.557
Don't be worried about everybody else.
Always look out for number one.

01:07:40.641 --> 01:07:41.600
Gandhi said that.

01:07:41.683 --> 01:07:43.518
- I don't think he said that.
- Yeah, he did.

01:07:43.602 --> 01:07:45.385
- Gandhi did not say...
- Somebody like Gandhi said that.

01:07:45.395 --> 01:07:46.345
"Take care of number one."

01:07:46.355 --> 01:07:48.440
It was a really wise...
It might've been Yoda.

01:07:48.523 --> 01:07:49.608
- Listen.
- I'm sorry, no.

01:07:49.691 --> 01:07:52.736
Agree to disagree.
The point is, you do you, you know?

01:07:52.819 --> 01:07:56.281
You gotta look out for you. And get
as far away from this place as you can.

01:07:58.700 --> 01:08:00.202
I don't know if I want to.

01:08:00.285 --> 01:08:01.870
Of course you do. What're you gonna do?

01:08:01.954 --> 01:08:04.194
You gonna live in a group home
for the rest of your life?

01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:06.650
Look, families are for people

01:08:06.667 --> 01:08:09.378
who can't take care
of themselves, okay? So...

01:08:10.796 --> 01:08:12.839
And you can take care of yourself.

01:08:12.923 --> 01:08:14.883
Also, look both ways
when you cross the street.

01:08:19.930 --> 01:08:21.974
I'll just call him. I'll just make sure.

01:08:25.435 --> 01:08:26.603
It's ringing.

01:08:29.064 --> 01:08:31.149
Red Cyclone, hey! Hey, what's going on?

01:08:31.984 --> 01:08:33.600
Oh, that's crazy!
Yeah, it's Freddy, by the way.

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:35.988
Yeah, it's crazy! Great story.

01:08:37.322 --> 01:08:39.073
He's not talking to anyone.

01:08:39.157 --> 01:08:40.993
I was!

01:08:41.076 --> 01:08:43.703
I was! We're friends. I know him, I do!

01:08:43.787 --> 01:08:45.706
I know him! I know him! Uh, yeah.

01:08:49.626 --> 01:08:50.627
Shit.

01:08:54.881 --> 01:08:56.258
Come on now.

01:08:56.341 --> 01:08:59.511
<i>Hands!
Lightning with my hands!</i>

01:08:59.594 --> 01:09:01.680
<i>Lightning with my hands!</i>

01:09:01.763 --> 01:09:03.724
<i>Lightning with my hands!</i>

01:09:03.807 --> 01:09:05.100
Hey. Hey.

01:09:05.684 --> 01:09:07.769
Hey, young man! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:09:07.894 --> 01:09:09.803
What are you doing?
I'm in the middle of a show right now.

01:09:09.813 --> 01:09:11.023
How can I help you?

01:09:11.106 --> 01:09:13.506
I just wanted to say thank you
for showing up to lunch today.

01:09:14.318 --> 01:09:17.279
Yeah, I got a little something
called a, uh, suitcase wedgie, right?

01:09:17.362 --> 01:09:18.270
I don't know if you've ever heard of it,

01:09:18.279 --> 01:09:21.366
but it's when someone grabs
your underwear like that

01:09:21.450 --> 01:09:24.161
and holds you like a suitcase,
walks you down the hallway.

01:09:24.243 --> 01:09:26.496
And this was my underwear.

01:09:29.332 --> 01:09:30.272
Gross.

01:09:30.959 --> 01:09:32.252
You said you'd come.

01:09:32.336 --> 01:09:34.421
You said I would come!
I never said I was...

01:09:34.504 --> 01:09:35.921
I'm a superhero, dude!

01:09:36.006 --> 01:09:37.716
Well, you're acting real heroic.

01:09:37.799 --> 01:09:39.216
How much people paying you today?

01:09:39.301 --> 01:09:42.595
Listen, I have
serious responsibilities now, okay?

01:09:42.679 --> 01:09:45.057
But that's cool because
I can carry that burden with my...

01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:47.768
<i>Hands!
Lightning with my hands!</i>

01:10:07.079 --> 01:10:08.413
Oh, man!

01:10:13.835 --> 01:10:15.003
Holy moly.

01:10:17.672 --> 01:10:20.258
Don't move! Nobody move!

01:10:28.642 --> 01:10:29.893
Oh, no, no!

01:10:29.976 --> 01:10:33.480
Oh, no, no, no! Stay, stay! Stay!

01:10:41.947 --> 01:10:42.781
Oh!

01:10:43.532 --> 01:10:44.692
Oh, that looked like it hurt.

01:10:45.158 --> 01:10:47.786
It's him! It's that superhero guy!

01:10:47.869 --> 01:10:50.539
Help us! Save us!

01:10:51.123 --> 01:10:51.957
Come on!

01:10:54.126 --> 01:10:56.294
Come on... Yeah.

01:10:56.878 --> 01:10:58.964
What's he doing?
What's going on?

01:11:07.264 --> 01:11:08.765
No way.

01:11:16.731 --> 01:11:18.608
Oh, no, no.
Please don't make me do this.

01:11:19.526 --> 01:11:20.846
God, this is the worst idea ever!

01:11:32.414 --> 01:11:34.374
I did it! I did it!

01:11:34.458 --> 01:11:36.668
I got the bus! I got the bus.

01:11:36.751 --> 01:11:38.462
Nobody move in there.

01:11:38.545 --> 01:11:40.945
Oh, I gotta put this thing down.
I gotta put this thing down.

01:11:41.506 --> 01:11:43.091
Oh!

01:11:44.384 --> 01:11:46.219
Oh.

01:11:46.344 --> 01:11:48.295
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Doggy, doggy, you have to move.

01:11:48.305 --> 01:11:50.098
Move! Move! Shoo! Shoo!

01:11:50.182 --> 01:11:52.017
Please be a good dog, good dog!

01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:53.518
You're being a bad dog!

01:11:53.602 --> 01:11:55.145
Go! Go!

01:11:56.021 --> 01:11:57.564
Please go. Please move.

01:11:58.565 --> 01:12:00.775
Yes, thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

01:12:00.859 --> 01:12:02.694
Thank you.

01:12:18.293 --> 01:12:21.254
Yeah. Yeah, no, no, no, no.

01:12:21.338 --> 01:12:23.288
I was in the neighborhood, you know,
so I thought...

01:12:23.298 --> 01:12:24.382
Thank you!

01:12:24.466 --> 01:12:26.259
It was kind of my fault anyway.

01:12:29.471 --> 01:12:32.891
So, it seems Philadelphia has gotten
an early Christmas present

01:12:32.974 --> 01:12:36.770
in the form of its very own superhero.

01:12:36.853 --> 01:12:38.104
And we're out.

01:12:38.813 --> 01:12:40.555
- Thank you very much.
- Oh, of course, yeah.

01:12:40.565 --> 01:12:43.360
Dude! Dude, dude!
Dude, did you see that?

01:12:43.443 --> 01:12:46.530
Yeah. You electrocuted a bus
and almost killed these people.

01:12:46.613 --> 01:12:48.281
And then I caught it!

01:12:48.865 --> 01:12:51.952
Freddy, I caught a bus
with my bare hands, man!

01:12:52.035 --> 01:12:53.954
I caught a bus
like people catch fly balls.

01:12:54.037 --> 01:12:55.413
Like, who does that? I do that!

01:12:55.497 --> 01:12:56.873
Billy! You do nothing.

01:12:56.957 --> 01:13:00.418
You take selfies
and make people pay you.

01:13:00.502 --> 01:13:03.797
You know, forget it. I can't really
talk to you when you look like this.

01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:05.590
You just wish it was you.

01:13:06.174 --> 01:13:07.217
No shit!

01:13:07.968 --> 01:13:11.596
You think?
I would kill to have what you have.

01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:13.723
Because everything I do is, like,

01:13:13.807 --> 01:13:16.601
some desperate attempt
to get people to notice me.

01:13:16.685 --> 01:13:18.728
To not feel sorry for me.

01:13:18.812 --> 01:13:21.523
I mean, look at me! Look at me.
Do you even see me?

01:13:22.148 --> 01:13:25.944
'Cause most people don't.
'Cause they don't want to.

01:13:26.736 --> 01:13:28.238
And now you don't either.

01:13:28.989 --> 01:13:31.074
I mean, you think this is who you are?

01:13:31.157 --> 01:13:32.701
I mean, Billy, you're 14,

01:13:32.784 --> 01:13:34.869
and now you're no better
than the Breyers.

01:13:35.662 --> 01:13:39.583
All this power, and all you did
was turn into a show-off and a bully.

01:13:42.627 --> 01:13:43.628
Whatever, kid!

01:13:43.712 --> 01:13:45.005
I do what I want!

01:13:46.965 --> 01:13:49.301
And I'm, like, mid-20s probably!

01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:52.095
Maybe even, like, 30.

01:13:55.599 --> 01:13:56.683
Chosen one.

01:14:00.645 --> 01:14:02.564
The so-called perfect man.

01:14:04.065 --> 01:14:05.275
Pure of heart.

01:14:06.526 --> 01:14:08.236
Flawless in every way.

01:14:11.072 --> 01:14:12.407
What made you so worthy?

01:14:12.490 --> 01:14:14.868
I'm sorry, can I help...

01:14:14.951 --> 01:14:16.276
Do you want an autograph or something?

01:14:16.286 --> 01:14:17.912
Give me your power.

01:14:20.373 --> 01:14:21.541
Or die.

01:14:21.625 --> 01:14:24.961
Oh, snap!
You're, like, a bad guy, right?

01:14:25.045 --> 01:14:28.298
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.
Before this gets really stupid for you,

01:14:28.381 --> 01:14:30.467
you should know that
I'm basically invincible.

01:14:39.225 --> 01:14:41.811
The weapons of man
draw no blood from our kind.

01:14:41.895 --> 01:14:43.938
I said, stop right there!

01:14:44.522 --> 01:14:46.191
The only thing
that extinguishes magic...

01:14:47.567 --> 01:14:48.485
is magic.

01:14:50.195 --> 01:14:52.280
Time to transfer your power to me.

01:14:55.492 --> 01:14:58.453
Oh, you did not see that one coming,
did you, grandpa?

01:14:58.536 --> 01:15:00.455
Them's street rules.

01:15:10.090 --> 01:15:11.299
Okay, okay, okay.

01:15:11.383 --> 01:15:13.176
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:15:13.259 --> 01:15:15.293
I never should've punched you
in the nuts like that.

01:15:15.303 --> 01:15:16.343
That was totally my bad.

01:15:16.346 --> 01:15:17.639
We can talk about this.

01:15:17.722 --> 01:15:19.224
You grovel like a child.

01:15:19.307 --> 01:15:21.351
That's because I am one. I'm a kid!

01:15:21.434 --> 01:15:22.852
You don't wanna hurt a kid, do you?

01:15:26.147 --> 01:15:28.983
I believe I can fly!
I believe I can fly, I can fly!

01:15:29.067 --> 01:15:30.767
Freddy said if I believe I can fly,
then I can fly.

01:15:30.777 --> 01:15:32.654
So I believe! I believe! I believe!

01:15:32.737 --> 01:15:33.613
Okay.

01:15:33.697 --> 01:15:34.781
Superman!

01:15:34.864 --> 01:15:36.616
Superman! What arm is it?

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:38.702
Why am I not flying?

01:15:38.785 --> 01:15:40.286
Please, I don't wanna die!

01:16:02.809 --> 01:16:04.436
I'm floating!

01:16:11.443 --> 01:16:12.944
What the hell was that?

01:16:16.614 --> 01:16:19.159
I can fly!

01:16:25.165 --> 01:16:26.040
Billy?

01:16:27.584 --> 01:16:29.252
Freddy! I need your help!

01:16:29.753 --> 01:16:31.129
You can fly?

01:16:39.095 --> 01:16:40.221
Who's the other guy?

01:16:40.722 --> 01:16:41.848
Santa!

01:16:44.976 --> 01:16:48.980
So, like, what do you and Mrs. Claus
do in the summertime?

01:16:49.063 --> 01:16:51.566
Well, in some ways,

01:16:51.649 --> 01:16:53.443
Santa is always here for you.

01:17:00.325 --> 01:17:01.284
Help Santa!

01:17:02.118 --> 01:17:04.829
Santa needs help! Help!

01:17:04.913 --> 01:17:06.372
Give us a shout if you need us.

01:17:13.463 --> 01:17:16.049
I'm just gonna chill in here
for a little while, if that's okay.

01:17:19.219 --> 01:17:21.054
This is crazy.

01:17:21.137 --> 01:17:22.629
This is crazy.
You don't have to fight this guy.

01:17:22.639 --> 01:17:24.766
This isn't your job. You can run, right?

01:17:24.849 --> 01:17:26.976
Yes, you can run. Awesome!

01:17:35.610 --> 01:17:37.028
Get back!

01:17:37.111 --> 01:17:38.530
Get away!

01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:42.534
- I'm Batman!
- Get him, Batman!

01:17:45.328 --> 01:17:46.496
Oh, sorry.

01:18:12.522 --> 01:18:13.690
Come on!

01:18:39.465 --> 01:18:41.009
Shazam!

01:19:11.414 --> 01:19:12.415
Billy!

01:19:13.833 --> 01:19:14.751
Billy!

01:19:16.252 --> 01:19:17.629
Billy, where are you?

01:19:20.757 --> 01:19:21.758
Billy!

01:19:23.009 --> 01:19:24.260
Where are you, Billy?

01:19:28.848 --> 01:19:30.224
Billy, come on!

01:19:33.353 --> 01:19:36.147
Billy. Where is he?

01:19:36.230 --> 01:19:37.607
Supervillain.

01:19:37.690 --> 01:19:40.360
Supervillain! Supervillain!

01:19:41.235 --> 01:19:43.529
Worse. Much worse.

01:19:44.405 --> 01:19:47.825
Radioactive anthromorph?
Psychic energy manipulator?

01:19:47.909 --> 01:19:51.079
I won't let you read my mind.
My mind is blank. You can't get in.

01:19:51.162 --> 01:19:54.874
I don't need to read your mind.
Because you are going to tell me.

01:19:56.125 --> 01:19:57.418
Where is he?

01:20:09.764 --> 01:20:11.307
Oh, my God, honey, are you okay?

01:20:12.016 --> 01:20:13.977
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:20:14.060 --> 01:20:15.645
What happened? Are you hurt?

01:20:15.728 --> 01:20:16.562
Come inside.

01:20:16.646 --> 01:20:17.939
We need to have a talk.

01:20:19.232 --> 01:20:21.109
Just don't be
so hard on him, okay?

01:20:27.657 --> 01:20:29.784
Running out on us! Lying!

01:20:30.034 --> 01:20:33.538
Huh? Then I get a call from the school,
telling me you've been cutting class!

01:20:33.621 --> 01:20:34.747
Getting in fights!

01:20:38.501 --> 01:20:41.004
<i>Bill, the man saved nine people.</i>

01:20:41.295 --> 01:20:43.172
Whoa! Is that...

01:20:43.256 --> 01:20:45.299
<i>I'm questioning his motive.</i>

01:20:45.383 --> 01:20:47.719
What's Freddy doing with a superhero?

01:20:50.430 --> 01:20:54.267
Or what's a superhero doing with Freddy?

01:20:57.770 --> 01:20:59.063
You remember dinner,

01:20:59.147 --> 01:21:03.151
when Billy and Freddy were arguing
like an old married couple, like this?

01:21:04.444 --> 01:21:06.821
When he rescued me,
he knew I lived in a group home.

01:21:06.904 --> 01:21:08.865
He knew my name. He called me Mary.

01:21:17.623 --> 01:21:21.044
Wait, are you saying Billy's
the Human Power Storm?

01:21:21.127 --> 01:21:22.920
Yes! You guys figured it out!

01:21:23.004 --> 01:21:24.464
All on your own. I didn't help.

01:21:24.547 --> 01:21:26.591
- I didn't break any promises.
- You knew?

01:21:27.216 --> 01:21:28.718
I'm a good sister!

01:21:32.972 --> 01:21:34.599
I mean, what were you thinking?

01:21:35.516 --> 01:21:37.310
And then you bring Freddy into it.

01:21:43.399 --> 01:21:46.235
Give him some space, guys.
He's a little upset, okay?

01:21:56.287 --> 01:21:57.288
Billy?

01:22:02.543 --> 01:22:03.753
You're him.

01:22:04.879 --> 01:22:06.172
You're the hero.

01:22:07.423 --> 01:22:09.217
Yeah, well, not anymore, so...

01:22:14.347 --> 01:22:16.557
Why do you have my notebook?

01:22:18.684 --> 01:22:20.144
Eugene finished your search.

01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:23.606
Look, I'm not a hacker, okay?

01:22:23.689 --> 01:22:26.025
But I have played <i>Watch Dogs</i> and <i>Uplink</i>.

01:22:26.109 --> 01:22:29.195
And maybe I did pick up a few skills,
which maybe did get me

01:22:29.278 --> 01:22:31.280
into federal databases
most people can't get into.

01:22:31.364 --> 01:22:33.491
Good for you, but I'm gonna go.

01:22:33.574 --> 01:22:37.286
Your parents' names
are Marilyn and C.C. Batson.

01:22:42.667 --> 01:22:43.709
What?

01:22:43.793 --> 01:22:46.045
You were born
in Zumbrota, Minnesota.

01:22:46.129 --> 01:22:47.839
They divorced when you were three.

01:22:47.922 --> 01:22:51.843
Your mom moved here that year.
Twenty months later, you got lost.

01:22:51.926 --> 01:22:52.760
You never found them

01:22:52.844 --> 01:22:55.972
'cause your dad's been in prison
in Florida for ten years.

01:22:56.055 --> 01:22:57.265
And your mom's...

01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:00.101
What?

01:23:01.853 --> 01:23:02.979
Is she dead?

01:23:03.604 --> 01:23:05.231
She's two subway stops away.

01:23:06.566 --> 01:23:07.608
What?

01:23:08.818 --> 01:23:11.863
You know, you didn't find her
because she reverted to her maiden name.

01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:18.161
Hey, Billy! Billy!

01:23:22.206 --> 01:23:23.531
- Victor, get the keys.
- I got it.

01:23:23.541 --> 01:23:25.793
Kids, stay here
in case Billy comes back.

01:23:32.592 --> 01:23:35.303
Come on. Inside, let's go.

01:23:44.103 --> 01:23:46.564
Wait. I thought
we were running after Billy.

01:23:46.647 --> 01:23:49.358
No, we're gonna wait here for now.

01:23:53.070 --> 01:23:54.322
Billy?

01:23:56.949 --> 01:23:57.909
Freddy?

01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:04.457
Oh, how quaint.

01:24:07.543 --> 01:24:09.253
Actually, I take that back.

01:24:11.464 --> 01:24:13.424
What a shithole.

01:24:56.259 --> 01:24:57.718
Just a second.

01:25:02.515 --> 01:25:04.173
Hey, look, I'm late
for work already, all right?

01:25:04.183 --> 01:25:06.894
We don't need any magazines or whatever.
Thanks, though.

01:25:06.978 --> 01:25:08.062
Oh, I'm not.

01:25:08.771 --> 01:25:11.107
You probably don't recognize me...

01:25:12.817 --> 01:25:14.235
but I found my way home.

01:25:15.695 --> 01:25:16.570
Mom.

01:25:18.656 --> 01:25:19.782
It's me.

01:25:21.117 --> 01:25:22.201
Oh, God.

01:25:23.619 --> 01:25:24.552
Is it?

01:25:27.540 --> 01:25:29.583
Um... Hang on.

01:25:30.751 --> 01:25:32.128
Who's at the door?

01:25:33.462 --> 01:25:34.714
It's, um...

01:25:35.381 --> 01:25:37.258
It's no one, Travis.

01:25:41.971 --> 01:25:43.681
That wasn't Dad, was it?

01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:46.058
No.

01:25:46.726 --> 01:25:49.270
Listen, um...

01:25:51.314 --> 01:25:52.440
It's really you, huh?

01:25:55.067 --> 01:25:58.779
I didn't mean to run away.
You know that, right?

01:25:59.488 --> 01:26:02.199
I let go, but it was by accident.

01:26:02.283 --> 01:26:03.993
Yeah, no. I know, yeah.

01:26:05.077 --> 01:26:06.203
I saw you.

01:26:07.413 --> 01:26:08.497
What?

01:26:11.625 --> 01:26:13.294
I saw you after.

01:26:16.088 --> 01:26:19.592
So, it was never your fault.

01:26:20.217 --> 01:26:24.305
Look, I was 17, okay?
And my daddy kicked me out.

01:26:24.930 --> 01:26:28.684
And your dad just decided
not to be a part of anything.

01:26:30.353 --> 01:26:32.897
<i>And I was hurting, and I was screwed up.</i>

01:26:35.316 --> 01:26:36.942
- I want the tiger.
- I know.

01:26:37.026 --> 01:26:38.736
I know, honey,

01:26:38.819 --> 01:26:41.489
but Mom's not exactly
going pro here, okay?

01:26:44.033 --> 01:26:45.326
Billy?

01:26:45.910 --> 01:26:46.744
Billy!

01:26:47.661 --> 01:26:48.829
Billy?

01:26:49.413 --> 01:26:52.083
Jesus Christ. Billy, this isn't funny!

01:26:52.166 --> 01:26:53.459
Here you go, buddy.

01:26:53.959 --> 01:26:56.670
That should warm you up. Is that better?

01:26:59.507 --> 01:27:02.760
<i>Look, it's just once
I saw you with the police,</i>

01:27:02.843 --> 01:27:04.970
<i>I realized that they could do</i>

01:27:05.054 --> 01:27:07.681
a <i>better job taking care of you
than I ever will.</i>

01:27:13.229 --> 01:27:14.688
But you're good, right?

01:27:16.482 --> 01:27:18.692
I mean, you landed on your feet.

01:27:19.402 --> 01:27:21.153
Because, I mean, you look real good.

01:27:23.572 --> 01:27:24.532
It's just...

01:27:26.951 --> 01:27:30.162
now is not a really good time
for me, Bill.

01:27:34.542 --> 01:27:39.338
All I wanted to do is
let you know I'm doing good,

01:27:41.132 --> 01:27:44.093
but I have to get back
to my real family.

01:27:46.262 --> 01:27:47.263
Here.

01:27:50.891 --> 01:27:51.725
What's this?

01:27:52.893 --> 01:27:55.521
Marilyn!
What's goin' on out there?

01:27:56.147 --> 01:27:57.731
You might need it more than me.

01:28:15.624 --> 01:28:18.210
Freddy, you were right.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

01:28:18.294 --> 01:28:21.881
<i>Come home, Billy.
Come home.</i>

01:28:21.964 --> 01:28:25.593
<i>Billy! Supervillain!
Supervillain!</i>

01:28:41.775 --> 01:28:42.818
Shazam!

01:28:56.707 --> 01:28:58.667
Who are you? What do you want?

01:28:59.293 --> 01:29:00.961
What do I want?

01:29:01.045 --> 01:29:02.796
I want...

01:29:07.718 --> 01:29:08.677
That.

01:29:10.054 --> 01:29:11.180
Whoa.

01:29:14.642 --> 01:29:16.393
Kick his ass, Billy!

01:29:19.855 --> 01:29:20.940
Yes, Billy.

01:29:21.524 --> 01:29:23.150
Try it, by all means.

01:29:23.234 --> 01:29:25.277
Let them go and I'll come inside.

01:29:25.361 --> 01:29:27.363
No, first, you come inside,

01:29:27.446 --> 01:29:28.948
then maybe I'll let them go.

01:29:46.048 --> 01:29:47.550
Good boy.

01:29:50.386 --> 01:29:52.346
Because that's all you are, isn't it?

01:29:53.222 --> 01:29:54.348
How old are you?

01:29:54.431 --> 01:29:56.725
- Basically 15.
- Hmm.

01:29:58.978 --> 01:30:02.648
When I was a child, the old man told me
I wasn't good enough.

01:30:02.731 --> 01:30:05.651
Yet here you are, a coward.

01:30:06.902 --> 01:30:11.240
Run from me and the wizard chooses you?
You're not a hero.

01:30:11.323 --> 01:30:13.909
But I'm gonna give you
the opportunity to be one.

01:30:14.994 --> 01:30:16.704
Give me the power of the champion.

01:30:16.787 --> 01:30:17.997
No. Don't do it, Billy.

01:30:34.972 --> 01:30:37.433
Give me the power and I'll let them go.

01:30:37.516 --> 01:30:38.726
Darla, no.

01:30:39.310 --> 01:30:40.394
Don't go, Billy.

01:30:41.562 --> 01:30:43.606
- Don't go, Billy.
- Darla, come here.

01:30:43.689 --> 01:30:45.524
No, I have to.

01:30:45.608 --> 01:30:48.444
It's what a good brother would do.
Right?

01:30:53.449 --> 01:30:54.533
Billy.

01:31:21.018 --> 01:31:23.729
I dedicated my life
to getting here.

01:31:24.772 --> 01:31:26.482
I scoured the earth.

01:31:27.066 --> 01:31:28.400
No one believed me.

01:31:28.609 --> 01:31:31.070
No one helped.

01:31:31.153 --> 01:31:32.571
Not the wizard.

01:31:33.739 --> 01:31:34.907
Not my family.

01:31:36.909 --> 01:31:38.535
I only had myself.

01:31:39.244 --> 01:31:40.412
I get it.

01:31:40.663 --> 01:31:43.374
I get what that's like.

01:31:45.334 --> 01:31:47.169
Feeling like
you're all alone in the world.

01:31:47.252 --> 01:31:48.212
Stand.

01:31:49.088 --> 01:31:51.455
Feeling like there's that one thing,
and if you could just find it,

01:31:51.465 --> 01:31:53.425
then you'd finally be good enough.

01:31:53.509 --> 01:31:54.468
Stand.

01:31:57.304 --> 01:31:58.931
The champion's name.

01:32:00.474 --> 01:32:01.475
Say it.

01:32:28.877 --> 01:32:30.129
Look, no offense, mister,

01:32:30.212 --> 01:32:32.732
but I don't think these things
have your best interest at heart.

01:32:33.257 --> 01:32:36.135
Don't listen to this child.

01:32:36.719 --> 01:32:39.221
Take the staff.

01:32:39.388 --> 01:32:43.684
Hold it
and say the champion's name.

01:32:44.309 --> 01:32:45.811
They're using you.

01:32:46.478 --> 01:32:48.897
You have to see that,
that they are using you.

01:32:48.981 --> 01:32:50.107
Say your name.

01:32:53.736 --> 01:32:54.570
His name...

01:32:55.863 --> 01:32:57.906
is Captain Sparklefingers.

01:32:57.990 --> 01:33:00.159
And we're gonna keep throwing things
at your big,

01:33:00.242 --> 01:33:02.202
fat, ugly-eyed head,

01:33:02.286 --> 01:33:04.163
until you let our brother go.

01:33:28.812 --> 01:33:30.492
Boy, am I glad
I didn't sell that Batarang.

01:33:31.064 --> 01:33:33.064
- Pedro, is that a lamp?
- It's an ugly one.

01:33:33.066 --> 01:33:34.860
Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:33:34.943 --> 01:33:36.183
Guys, I appreciate the thought,

01:33:36.195 --> 01:33:38.312
I really do, but I don't think
your weapons are gonna help.

01:33:38.322 --> 01:33:39.865
You can put 'em down now.

01:33:41.492 --> 01:33:42.618
The door was right here.

01:33:42.701 --> 01:33:44.119
Billy, how do we get outta here?

01:33:44.703 --> 01:33:46.183
What, you think I know? I don't know.

01:33:46.997 --> 01:33:47.831
This way!

01:33:47.915 --> 01:33:49.416
Go, go, go. Follow Darla.

01:33:49.500 --> 01:33:51.293
Good job, Darla. Go, go, go!

01:33:51.376 --> 01:33:52.294
Kids?

01:33:54.004 --> 01:33:55.047
Why is this open?

01:33:55.631 --> 01:33:57.758
Freddy? Mary?

01:34:01.428 --> 01:34:02.846
Pedro, Pedro, come on.

01:34:02.930 --> 01:34:04.723
Freddy? Freddy, keep up.

01:34:04.807 --> 01:34:06.099
Darla, stay in front.

01:34:06.934 --> 01:34:08.101
We gotta hurry.

01:34:31.750 --> 01:34:32.960
Whoa!

01:34:34.044 --> 01:34:36.255
So many doors.

01:34:36.338 --> 01:34:39.132
One of these has to be a way out, right?

01:34:39.216 --> 01:34:40.509
Yeah, I would hope so.

01:34:57.526 --> 01:34:58.569
Not this one.

01:35:12.666 --> 01:35:14.751
Okay, no more doors.
Nobody open any more doors.

01:35:14.835 --> 01:35:16.753
Come on, Billy. What are we gonna do?

01:35:16.837 --> 01:35:17.921
Darla, I don't know.

01:35:18.005 --> 01:35:20.507
Yes, you do. Just think.
How'd you get out last time?

01:35:20.591 --> 01:35:22.791
Uh, last time, I thought about
the subway, and I was on the subway.

01:35:22.801 --> 01:35:24.720
Okay. Then, Billy, look,
think about the subway.

01:35:24.803 --> 01:35:27.514
Think about any place
except for here, okay?

01:35:49.703 --> 01:35:50.871
Come on, come on, come on.

01:35:50.954 --> 01:35:52.664
Why are you covering my eyes?

01:35:52.748 --> 01:35:55.375
Really? This is the first place
you think of? Wow!

01:35:55.459 --> 01:35:56.543
You're welcome!

01:35:56.627 --> 01:35:58.253
Why can't I see what's inside?

01:35:58.337 --> 01:35:59.796
You are not old enough.

01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:01.757
Old enough to know that was great music.

01:36:02.549 --> 01:36:03.508
Not my thing.

01:36:03.592 --> 01:36:04.718
Where's Freddy?

01:36:04.801 --> 01:36:05.969
Yeah, you, too, Sriracha.

01:36:06.053 --> 01:36:07.763
Hey, have a holly jolly Christmas.

01:36:07.846 --> 01:36:09.139
Freddy! What are you doing?

01:36:09.222 --> 01:36:10.599
Nice people.

01:36:10.682 --> 01:36:11.558
Nice people? Come on.

01:36:11.642 --> 01:36:13.675
Is that glitter?
They have glitter! Can I get glitter?

01:36:13.685 --> 01:36:14.895
No, not from them.

01:36:14.978 --> 01:36:16.021
Please?

01:36:16.104 --> 01:36:16.939
No..

01:36:18.982 --> 01:36:19.816
Darla.

01:36:24.947 --> 01:36:26.865
Go, go, go. Everybody, go!

01:36:26.949 --> 01:36:28.575
Freddy? Freddy, Freddy.

01:36:28.659 --> 01:36:30.019
One, two, three. Up, up. Up we go.

01:36:38.460 --> 01:36:40.087
Carnival, go! Go, Mary, go.

01:36:40.170 --> 01:36:41.964
Come on, Pedro. Come on.

01:36:53.809 --> 01:36:55.394
Don't run, but don't walk.
Just be cool.

01:36:55.477 --> 01:36:58.146
Act naturally,
like kids naturally act in a carnival.

01:36:58.230 --> 01:37:00.013
- He's not gonna look for us here.
- Is that him?

01:37:00.023 --> 01:37:01.556
- Oh, my God!
- Dude, it's Zap-tain America!

01:37:01.566 --> 01:37:03.527
- Power Boy!
- He's an impersonator, okay?

01:37:03.610 --> 01:37:04.893
Yeah, I'm an impersonator!
I'm a fake version of myself.

01:37:04.903 --> 01:37:06.321
Don't take pictures.

01:37:08.532 --> 01:37:09.700
Shazam!

01:37:16.832 --> 01:37:18.375
Hey! Where'd he go?

01:37:18.458 --> 01:37:19.668
What, is he invisible now?

01:37:27.050 --> 01:37:29.845
Oh, man, I just spit on a baby!

01:37:31.304 --> 01:37:32.889
Yo, what is that?

01:37:36.351 --> 01:37:37.686
Who is that guy?

01:37:38.687 --> 01:37:40.188
Champion.

01:37:43.066 --> 01:37:45.152
You don't deserve that name.

01:37:46.528 --> 01:37:49.197
See that? Look at that up there!

01:37:49.281 --> 01:37:52.909
Hiding behind
innocent people who will now die.

01:37:54.703 --> 01:37:58.290
Because deep down
you're still just a scared little boy.

01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:02.085
Oh, no.

01:38:03.336 --> 01:38:05.964
Run! Run!

01:38:18.894 --> 01:38:21.396
- Oh! What do we do?
- Just hold on!

01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:23.148
- To what?
- The bar, you idiot!

01:38:32.324 --> 01:38:34.201
Well, you wanted me to be a hero.

01:38:34.284 --> 01:38:35.327
Are you kidding?

01:38:35.410 --> 01:38:39.206
Okay, no. Old guy's up there
harboring multiple spiritual entities.

01:38:39.289 --> 01:38:40.999
Plus, he has the same powers as you.

01:38:41.083 --> 01:38:42.532
Plus, I mean, he knows what he's doing.

01:38:42.542 --> 01:38:44.942
Plus, I mean, you're my best friend.
I don't want you to die.

01:38:45.921 --> 01:38:48.548
If a superhero can't save his family,

01:38:49.883 --> 01:38:50.926
he's not much of a hero.

01:38:55.806 --> 01:38:57.015
That was a decent catchphrase.

01:38:58.100 --> 01:38:59.017
Shazam!

01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:09.903
Now, let's try this again.

01:39:24.292 --> 01:39:25.752
Or try that again!

01:39:34.010 --> 01:39:34.845
Billy, look out!

01:39:38.181 --> 01:39:40.433
Laser eyes!
Guys, he's got laser eyes!

01:39:40.517 --> 01:39:42.686
Too bad your aim sucks balls!

01:39:52.571 --> 01:39:53.780
That's his power matrix.

01:39:53.864 --> 01:39:54.864
His what-what?

01:39:54.906 --> 01:39:57.909
When the demon guys leave his eye,
he loses his powers.

01:39:58.702 --> 01:40:00.245
That's why the Batarang hurt him.

01:40:01.496 --> 01:40:02.372
Hey!

01:40:02.455 --> 01:40:03.414
Over here!

01:40:04.833 --> 01:40:06.616
- Wait. What are you doing?
- Trust me. Divide and conquer.

01:40:06.626 --> 01:40:08.986
We separate the Sins from the eye,
and he's just an old man.

01:40:09.546 --> 01:40:10.797
Gather the mutts.

01:40:24.561 --> 01:40:25.562
Run!

01:40:31.818 --> 01:40:33.904
Darla, no!

01:40:48.877 --> 01:40:50.587
Here. Take it.

01:40:50.670 --> 01:40:52.547
Take it. It's for you.

01:40:52.631 --> 01:40:54.216
Hold it tight.

01:40:54.299 --> 01:40:57.260
Close your eyes.
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:40:57.344 --> 01:40:58.803
- Okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:40:59.679 --> 01:41:00.805
Okay.

01:41:41.137 --> 01:41:42.264
Shazam!

01:42:04.577 --> 01:42:05.996
Shazam!

01:42:11.084 --> 01:42:12.585
Playtime's over, boy.

01:42:14.170 --> 01:42:15.672
Your friends can't help you anymore.

01:42:15.755 --> 01:42:16.923
Shazam!

01:42:21.511 --> 01:42:22.679
Hey!

01:42:49.539 --> 01:42:50.665
Shazam!

01:43:15.231 --> 01:43:16.941
Nice trick.

01:43:17.025 --> 01:43:18.026
Catchy.

01:43:18.610 --> 01:43:20.487
One simple word.

01:43:20.570 --> 01:43:22.238
I have a better trick.

01:43:23.198 --> 01:43:24.491
Four words.

01:43:25.784 --> 01:43:26.951
Kill the little girl.

01:43:27.035 --> 01:43:29.662
- Darla, no!
- Take me instead!

01:43:33.958 --> 01:43:35.001
Stop!

01:43:50.517 --> 01:43:53.269
Billy, there's one more
demon guy in his eye!

01:43:53.353 --> 01:43:55.355
You gotta just rip it out
of his face hole!

01:43:55.438 --> 01:43:56.598
It's where he gets his power.

01:44:01.111 --> 01:44:02.320
Reach for it.

01:44:04.030 --> 01:44:04.864
I dare you.

01:44:14.124 --> 01:44:15.417
Wise decision.

01:44:17.752 --> 01:44:19.129
Hands on the staff.

01:44:19.921 --> 01:44:22.173
Billy, don't do this. Billy!

01:44:22.257 --> 01:44:23.842
- Billy.
- Don't do it, Billy!

01:44:23.925 --> 01:44:24.884
Don't!

01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:47.907
<i>Say my name so my power
may flow through you.</i>

01:44:47.991 --> 01:44:51.119
I open my heart to you, Billy Batson.

01:44:51.202 --> 01:44:55.039
And in so doing, choose you as champion.

01:44:55.707 --> 01:44:59.252
With your heart,
unlock your greatest power.

01:44:59.335 --> 01:45:02.130
The thrones
of our brothers and sisters await.

01:45:10.763 --> 01:45:11.598
All hands on deck.

01:45:17.228 --> 01:45:18.438
Say my name.

01:45:19.814 --> 01:45:21.191
Billy!

01:45:21.274 --> 01:45:22.275
No, not my name.

01:45:22.358 --> 01:45:24.158
Say the name that I say
to turn into this guy.

01:45:25.361 --> 01:45:26.279
Shazam!

01:46:05.151 --> 01:46:06.110
Guys.

01:46:08.154 --> 01:46:09.072
What's happening?

01:46:13.618 --> 01:46:14.702
I can fly!

01:46:19.832 --> 01:46:21.209
Guys.

01:46:21.292 --> 01:46:23.336
Check out these guns.

01:46:24.295 --> 01:46:27.298
No. It's not possible.

01:46:29.300 --> 01:46:32.262
Gee-whiz, mister.
Sorry I took your cane.

01:46:32.345 --> 01:46:33.513
Do you want it back?

01:46:36.182 --> 01:46:37.642
Guys, I don't believe in violence,

01:46:38.226 --> 01:46:41.521
but I think we should kick
this guy's butt, like, really hard.

01:46:46.276 --> 01:46:47.569
Whoa!

01:46:53.199 --> 01:46:54.599
Guys, I think I can move really...

01:46:55.535 --> 01:46:56.452
fast.

01:46:57.245 --> 01:46:59.247
Hyper-speed! Check!

01:47:08.339 --> 01:47:10.800
Billy! The eye!

01:47:18.683 --> 01:47:19.601
Look out!

01:47:21.894 --> 01:47:22.729
Whoa!

01:47:24.397 --> 01:47:26.691
What?

01:47:28.067 --> 01:47:29.022
- What!
- Dude!

01:47:29.027 --> 01:47:31.029
You almost exploded me.

01:48:17.033 --> 01:48:18.951
Dude, I've studied
the fighting techniques

01:48:19.035 --> 01:48:20.495
of every single superhero.

01:48:21.788 --> 01:48:23.539
What do you got?

01:48:26.918 --> 01:48:28.419
Well, that's terrifying.

01:49:02.370 --> 01:49:04.372
Enough games, boy.

01:49:05.415 --> 01:49:06.874
You think a pack of children can...

01:49:10.294 --> 01:49:11.379
Wait, what?

01:49:11.462 --> 01:49:13.756
You will beg for mercy

01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:15.800
as I feast on your heart...

01:49:16.592 --> 01:49:17.427
slow.

01:49:19.345 --> 01:49:22.932
Are you making some big evil guy speech
right now or something?

01:49:23.015 --> 01:49:26.561
You're, like, a mile away from me
right now. There's cars and trucks.

01:49:26.644 --> 01:49:29.605
I will have the world
eating out of the palm of my hand...

01:49:29.689 --> 01:49:32.150
All I see is mouth moving.
I don't hear any...

01:49:32.233 --> 01:49:35.737
Only I have the power to unleash...

01:49:37.655 --> 01:49:38.948
Ah, whatever. Screw it.

01:50:09.896 --> 01:50:11.230
Oh, my gosh. Those people!

01:50:19.322 --> 01:50:20.448
Hi!

01:50:20.531 --> 01:50:21.908
Wow. I caught you.

01:50:33.377 --> 01:50:35.963
I got it. I got it.

01:50:42.178 --> 01:50:43.930
Oh, my God. I do got it.

01:51:00.279 --> 01:51:01.437
You're not gonna believe this,

01:51:01.447 --> 01:51:03.439
but you're actually the first villain
I've ever fought.

01:51:03.449 --> 01:51:05.076
It's kind of a huge deal for me.

01:51:19.465 --> 01:51:22.009
Somebody help!

01:51:36.107 --> 01:51:39.026
Hi. Wow. It's really you.

01:51:40.069 --> 01:51:42.864
My name is Darla,
and I've been really good.

01:51:42.947 --> 01:51:43.823
What?

01:51:47.994 --> 01:51:49.161
Oh, crap.

01:51:50.663 --> 01:51:51.539
No, no, no.

01:51:51.622 --> 01:51:52.623
No, no. No!

01:52:10.641 --> 01:52:12.226
No! No, no.

01:52:20.443 --> 01:52:21.485
Oh, my God!

01:52:21.569 --> 01:52:23.237
Is he giving us
suitcase wedgies?

01:53:00.399 --> 01:53:02.276
So this is, like,
the Seven Deadly Sins, right?

01:53:03.527 --> 01:53:05.947
I mean, I've never been great at math,

01:53:06.030 --> 01:53:08.824
but, uh, the big, angry one,
that's Wrath, yeah?

01:53:08.908 --> 01:53:10.910
And then Gluttony, obvi.

01:53:11.786 --> 01:53:15.247
Pride, Greed, Sloth, Lust,

01:53:15.331 --> 01:53:18.960
who I thought was gonna be
way hotter, if I'm being honest.

01:53:19.627 --> 01:53:22.713
But that's only six.
Where's lucky number seven?

01:53:22.797 --> 01:53:25.007
Where's little man? Where's Envy?

01:53:25.091 --> 01:53:27.760
Is he just scared of me and my family
because we're so awesome?

01:53:27.843 --> 01:53:28.678
Because I get that.

01:53:29.428 --> 01:53:31.597
Like, the other sins,
they get to come out and fight

01:53:31.681 --> 01:53:33.557
because they're big
and strong and scary.

01:53:33.641 --> 01:53:34.725
But Envy...

01:53:36.102 --> 01:53:37.561
he's just the runt.

01:53:50.199 --> 01:53:53.244
And that's why all the other sins
never invite him out to play, man.

01:53:53.327 --> 01:53:55.121
Because they all know who'd win.

01:53:56.038 --> 01:54:01.335
And it's not weak, worthless, ugly Envy.

01:54:27.570 --> 01:54:29.155
Gotcha.

01:54:29.238 --> 01:54:31.282
Shazam!

01:54:37.705 --> 01:54:39.081
Shazam!

01:54:49.508 --> 01:54:51.260
Ready to go round up your buddies?

01:55:20.581 --> 01:55:23.918
No. No!

01:55:53.614 --> 01:55:55.991
Here's the thing about power.

01:55:56.117 --> 01:55:59.829
What good's power,
if you got nobody to share it with?

01:56:01.455 --> 01:56:03.207
- Nice.
- Ta-da!

01:56:03.290 --> 01:56:04.208
That's disgusting.

01:56:04.291 --> 01:56:05.126
Fatality.

01:56:07.002 --> 01:56:08.045
I got the voice.

01:56:11.799 --> 01:56:12.633
What's that?

01:56:18.514 --> 01:56:20.683
I can have anything I've ever wanted?

01:56:24.520 --> 01:56:25.688
Billy.

01:56:25.813 --> 01:56:26.981
No, no, no!

01:56:27.064 --> 01:56:28.524
- Stop it!
- Don't look at that!

01:56:28.607 --> 01:56:29.859
Billy, don't do it!

01:56:30.609 --> 01:56:32.027
Ah!

01:56:32.653 --> 01:56:34.822
- You should hear yourselves!
- Not funny.

01:56:34.905 --> 01:56:36.949
You think I'm gonna put
a demon ball in my head?

01:56:37.032 --> 01:56:37.950
That's disgusting.

01:56:38.033 --> 01:56:40.411
That's funny. That's pretty funny.
You got me going.

01:56:40.494 --> 01:56:41.996
- You got me going.
- Uh... Guys.

01:56:45.249 --> 01:56:46.083
What?

01:56:48.127 --> 01:56:49.587
Oh. Hey.

01:56:50.171 --> 01:56:52.548
Oh, wow.

01:57:00.097 --> 01:57:01.432
All right, We did it!

01:57:01.515 --> 01:57:05.519
Hey, all right, yeah! We did it!

01:57:06.729 --> 01:57:08.939
We did it!

01:57:09.356 --> 01:57:12.276
Hey, you guys are all safe.
There's no more danger anymore.

01:57:12.359 --> 01:57:14.695
- We're fine. It's okay.
- All right, all right, all right.

01:57:14.778 --> 01:57:15.821
We're good.

01:57:26.207 --> 01:57:27.875
You sure this is gonna work?

01:57:29.627 --> 01:57:30.669
Told ya.

01:57:31.212 --> 01:57:32.421
Whoa!

01:57:34.215 --> 01:57:35.174
Whoa!

01:57:50.022 --> 01:57:51.555
You guys know what this place is, right?

01:57:51.565 --> 01:57:54.693
A dark, haunted cave with demon statues.

01:57:54.777 --> 01:57:57.446
Well, yes, but also...

01:57:59.740 --> 01:58:03.327
Lair! We got a lair!

01:58:03.410 --> 01:58:04.536
- Lair.
- Yeah.

01:58:04.620 --> 01:58:05.663
No, you right.

01:58:05.746 --> 01:58:07.289
We got a lair.

01:58:09.291 --> 01:58:10.542
What's a lair?

01:58:11.460 --> 01:58:13.212
<i>And thanks to six superheroes,</i>

01:58:13.295 --> 01:58:17.383
<i>citizens are back in their homes,
safe again with their families.</i>

01:58:17.466 --> 01:58:19.927
<i>And here with an eyewitness account
of the events...</i>

01:58:20.010 --> 01:58:22.263
<i>It was crazy, man!</i>

01:58:22.346 --> 01:58:24.265
<i>Creatures from hell!</i>

01:58:24.348 --> 01:58:26.934
<i>Lightning coming out
of everyone's everything!</i>

01:58:27.017 --> 01:58:29.770
<i>And that is not cool, man!</i>

01:58:29.853 --> 01:58:31.897
So, first day as a superhero.

01:58:31.981 --> 01:58:35.109
Automatic top spot
for best ever.

01:58:35.192 --> 01:58:37.027
The man shattered
the glass noodle ceiling.

01:58:37.111 --> 01:58:38.862
- No. That's racist.
- Not if I say it.

01:58:38.946 --> 01:58:39.947
Guys.

01:58:41.073 --> 01:58:42.449
- All hands on deck.
- Oh!

01:58:45.160 --> 01:58:46.996
Wait, wait, wait.

01:58:47.079 --> 01:58:48.122
Wait.

01:58:48.205 --> 01:58:49.790
Thank you for this food.

01:58:49.873 --> 01:58:51.917
Thank you for this day.

01:58:52.001 --> 01:58:53.043
Thank you for this family.

01:58:54.128 --> 01:58:56.213
I thought maybe this time I'd stay.

01:58:57.631 --> 01:59:00.384
I mean, after all,

01:59:00.467 --> 01:59:01.343
I'm home.

01:59:33.459 --> 01:59:35.210
He better not sit at our table.

01:59:38.547 --> 01:59:39.673
Nope!

01:59:42.176 --> 01:59:43.093
Okay.

01:59:46.764 --> 01:59:48.223
What are you doing?

01:59:48.307 --> 01:59:50.351
Waiting for your imaginary BFF
to show up?

01:59:50.434 --> 01:59:51.602
Yeah.

02:00:00.277 --> 02:00:01.437
What are you guys doing here?

02:00:01.779 --> 02:00:03.197
Well, we're having lunch with you.

02:00:03.280 --> 02:00:04.920
But you guys have
different lunch periods.

02:00:05.407 --> 02:00:07.007
Well, we made
a very special arrangement.

02:00:08.744 --> 02:00:11.288
- Darla, what's going on?
- Why are you asking me?

02:00:11.997 --> 02:00:12.998
Freddy Freeman.

02:00:15.459 --> 02:00:20.756
This guy taught me everything I know
about being a dope superhero.

02:00:20.839 --> 02:00:23.133
True story. You should get
some pointers from him.

02:00:23.217 --> 02:00:27.721
What's going on,
my best bud in the whole world?

02:00:27.805 --> 02:00:32.101
And also new kids that I'm meeting
for the first time but seem very cool?

02:00:32.434 --> 02:00:33.394
Uh...

02:00:33.477 --> 02:00:36.271
I invited another friend.
I hope that's okay.

02:03:32.990 --> 02:03:37.244
Sun of Ra.

02:03:38.495 --> 02:03:45.085
Ouroboros.

02:03:46.920 --> 02:03:50.465
Solomon's...

02:03:50.549 --> 02:03:52.843
Knot.

02:04:04.021 --> 02:04:07.524
No! No!

02:04:13.905 --> 02:04:16.783
<i>Primitive symbols.</i>

02:04:16.867 --> 02:04:21.580
<i>You walking, talking monkeys
with your cave drawings.</i>

02:04:22.331 --> 02:04:26.418
<i>You assume there's only one way
to gain magic.</i>

02:04:26.501 --> 02:04:28.295
<i>No, no, no.</i>

02:04:29.546 --> 02:04:32.424
<i>There are more ways
than a mind can imagine.</i>

02:04:33.550 --> 02:04:35.427
What in God's name?

02:04:35.510 --> 02:04:39.973
<i>I name the gods, Doctor.
Not the other way around.</i>

02:04:40.057 --> 02:04:43.268
<i>Oh, what fun
we're going to have together.</i>

02:04:43.352 --> 02:04:47.314
<i>The Seven Realms are about to be ours.</i>

02:11:13.742 --> 02:11:16.036
Don't beat yourself up, buddy.
You're gonna find someone.

02:11:16.870 --> 02:11:18.621
Yeah, I'm sure.

02:11:18.705 --> 02:11:20.999
Because there's plenty of fish
in the sea.

02:11:22.709 --> 02:11:24.509
Of course it's not real.
I can't talk to fish.

02:11:24.627 --> 02:11:27.328
Even if I could, I mean, honestly,
what could we do with that that's cool?

02:11:27.338 --> 02:11:31.593
I don't know, maybe command
an army of billions in the ocean.

02:11:31.676 --> 02:11:34.846
Oh, yeah. Well, that's not that cool.
