01:11.988 --> 01:16.659
Whoever said youth's wasted on the young
must've lived in a condo.

01:16.743 --> 01:18.745
[tires screeching]

01:18.828 --> 01:20.705
[Goofy] Hiya there, Petey!

01:20.789 --> 01:24.125
Sure appreciate your letting Max
earn some pocket money over there.

01:24.250 --> 01:26.336
My pleasure, Goof.

01:26.419 --> 01:30.340
A boy's never too young to learn
the honest value of an honest dollar.

01:30.423 --> 01:35.929
Besides, it's best they start with an
enlightened employer like yours truly.

01:36.012 --> 01:39.307
Somebody to ease them into
the harsh realities

01:39.391 --> 01:41.101
awaiting them in the working world.

01:41.184 --> 01:43.937
[chuckles] They're in good hands,
all righty.

01:47.440 --> 01:48.858
[yells] What're you doing down there?

01:48.942 --> 01:50.777
I didn't schedule any breaks!

01:50.860 --> 01:55.448
So quit resting on your laurels
and go unload them boxes!

01:56.866 --> 01:59.119
Uh, what is all this, Dad?

01:59.202 --> 02:02.455
Eye-popping, customer-grabbing
sales-inducing,

02:02.539 --> 02:05.375
strategic advertising appliances.

02:05.458 --> 02:08.420
If you can beat the sweet cheap
treat of Pete's neat car fleet,

02:08.503 --> 02:10.797
I'll take the heat and eat raw meat.

02:11.172 --> 02:14.384
-You'd really eat raw meat?
-[laughs]

02:14.467 --> 02:18.888
You don't understand
the concept of advertising, son.

02:18.972 --> 02:21.975
You see, if you don't
stretch the truth a little,

02:22.058 --> 02:23.727
nobody's gonna believe it.

02:31.484 --> 02:32.986
Now that's enough gabbing.

02:33.069 --> 02:34.320
Get down there and clean the driveway

02:34.404 --> 02:37.157
and don't forget to use
the small toothbrushes.

02:37.240 --> 02:38.158
[door slams]

02:42.078 --> 02:43.455
[snoring]

02:46.332 --> 02:49.419
Well, go ahead, Peej. Ask him.

02:50.628 --> 02:53.506
Uh, Dad? Great stickers, Dad.

02:53.590 --> 02:56.843
[stammers] Listen, could we, uh,
maybe get, sort of, you know,

02:56.926 --> 02:59.554
paid for the, uh, work we did?

02:59.637 --> 03:02.182
Why, sure, son.

03:07.896 --> 03:10.982
Twenty-five cents for twelve hours work?

03:12.150 --> 03:15.362
[laughs] Sorry, my mistake.

03:15.445 --> 03:17.989
Quarters and nickels look too much alike.

03:18.073 --> 03:21.076
I thought we were at least
getting minimum wage.

03:21.159 --> 03:23.328
You can't get much more minimum than that.

03:24.079 --> 03:25.914
I knew we should've joined a union.

03:25.997 --> 03:29.250
So, you expect the world handed

03:29.334 --> 03:31.670
to you on a silver platter, is that it?

03:31.753 --> 03:36.132
Think you ought to be earning corporate
level, executive-type wages, eh?

03:36.216 --> 03:38.802
I used to walk through snow
five miles deep,

03:38.885 --> 03:41.388
twelve days a week,
just to get to the coal mine.

03:41.471 --> 03:43.807
No time off, not even Arbor Day.

03:43.890 --> 03:46.434
Now that was a real job!

03:46.518 --> 03:52.107
Maybe it's time you Rockefellers learned
what it's like in the real world.

03:52.190 --> 03:54.943
Maybe it's time you had a real job!

03:58.029 --> 04:02.701
Aren't there child labor laws
in this country?

04:02.784 --> 04:04.953
[sputters]

04:05.036 --> 04:08.623
Now you're getting a taste
of the real working world.

04:08.707 --> 04:10.458
[guffaws]

04:10.542 --> 04:12.377
[air hissing]

04:30.061 --> 04:33.231
Ah, I love the smell of newsprint
in the morning.

04:33.314 --> 04:37.068
Especially when it's a newspaper
running my ad. [laughs]

04:37.152 --> 04:41.072
Too bad they got to put
all this news stuff on the front page.

04:41.156 --> 04:43.908
Why, I'm gonna have more customers
than you can shake a dipstick at,

04:43.992 --> 04:47.495
thanks to this thin ad.

04:48.329 --> 04:49.831
All right, where'd they hide it?

04:49.914 --> 04:51.249
[both screaming]

04:51.332 --> 04:54.377
Why, it should've been on page one
for what I shelled out!

04:54.919 --> 05:00.008
What? Why, why, that's not an ad,
it's a wart!

05:00.508 --> 05:03.595
Where do they come off charging
15 bucks for the likes of that?

05:03.678 --> 05:06.348
Ooh! They're even bigger crooks than me!

05:06.431 --> 05:08.308
Oh, if I was running this paper,

05:08.391 --> 05:10.685
I'd never pull a low-down stunt
like that on myself

05:10.769 --> 05:12.020
and live to tell about it.

05:12.103 --> 05:13.772
Hmm...

05:13.855 --> 05:16.608
Running my own paper, eh?

05:16.691 --> 05:18.276
[whooshing]

05:20.111 --> 05:22.447
[chuckles] Well, look what dropped in.

05:22.530 --> 05:26.117
What kind of grades are you boys
getting in English?

05:26.201 --> 05:28.536
Um... B plus.

05:28.620 --> 05:32.415
[stammers] Uh, yeah, I...
I don't remember exactly, Dad,

05:32.499 --> 05:34.793
but I think it started with an F.

05:35.377 --> 05:38.129
I suppose you could
do the editorial section.

05:38.213 --> 05:41.216
You see, I'm starting my own newspaper

05:41.383 --> 05:45.553
and you two are gonna be
my star reporters!

05:45.637 --> 05:47.055
[chuckles]

05:49.557 --> 05:53.478
Say, Goof, our boys are turning into lazy,
lifeless slugs, wouldn't you say?

05:53.561 --> 05:55.230
Well, Pete, I...

05:55.313 --> 05:57.482
It's high time they did some growing up,

05:57.565 --> 05:59.317
learned a trade, don't you think?

05:59.401 --> 06:01.069
Learned to trade what?

06:01.152 --> 06:05.073
Why, they're falling behind the times,
losing that competitive edge.

06:05.156 --> 06:05.990
Am I right?

06:06.074 --> 06:08.785
Well, Pete... hmm...

06:08.868 --> 06:11.413
Looks like we got some termite
damage in here.

06:11.496 --> 06:15.500
If we don't fertilize some good
old American know-how in them boys,

06:15.583 --> 06:17.502
this country's gonna go bottom up!

06:17.585 --> 06:19.254
That's what I thought, too,

06:19.337 --> 06:22.507
but I didn't want to say
anything till I was sure.

06:23.675 --> 06:26.344
-Whoo-hoo!
-[crash]

06:30.015 --> 06:32.017
[clock chimes]

06:32.100 --> 06:34.769
Oh, so that's where
I put them knitting needles.

06:35.854 --> 06:38.356
That's why I'm starting a newspaper

06:38.440 --> 06:41.276
and making our boys reporters.

06:41.693 --> 06:45.613
Oof! Our Max and our P.J.? Reporters?

06:45.697 --> 06:48.616
Why, the whole future
of this entire universe

06:48.700 --> 06:51.369
of our nation practically depends on it!

06:51.953 --> 06:53.955
You wouldn't want our boys responsible

06:54.039 --> 06:56.541
for the destruction of these
"Untied States", would you?

06:56.624 --> 07:02.464
[groans] If my Max knows one thing,
it's not to destroy the United States.

07:02.714 --> 07:03.965
That's from good upbringing.

07:04.049 --> 07:08.970
There's only one slight
minor little detail.

07:09.387 --> 07:12.223
-What's that?
-We need cash to get started!

07:12.307 --> 07:14.142
If you kick in the front money,

07:14.225 --> 07:16.686
I'll only take 75% of the profits,
instead of my usual 80.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.229
Well, um...

07:18.313 --> 07:20.857
Hey! You're not pulling a fast one on me!

07:20.940 --> 07:24.235
[chuckles] You'll take the full 80%!

07:30.742 --> 07:33.870
You know, boys, I used to dream
of being a reporter myself.

07:33.953 --> 07:35.288
Would've made it, too...

07:36.456 --> 07:38.792
If I could've mastered
the English language.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.835
[chuckles] Here we are.

07:40.919 --> 07:45.799
Genuine authentic imitation
artificial reporter outfits.

07:45.882 --> 07:48.802
Been keeping them in mothballs
all these years.

07:50.720 --> 07:54.140
[mispronounces]
Voila! If you'll pardon my French.

07:54.724 --> 07:59.979
Oh, Maxie. You remind me of you
when you were your age, only younger.

08:00.063 --> 08:03.733
Come on, Peej. We're gonna be rich
and famous before supper!

08:05.151 --> 08:08.071
Well, now don't go counting
your chickens with a hatchet.

08:08.154 --> 08:10.240
There's lots to know about reporterin'.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.575
And that's why I'm gonna
give you my old book.

08:12.659 --> 08:14.744
Tells you everything
you ever wanted to know

08:14.828 --> 08:16.579
about being a reporter...

08:17.247 --> 08:19.165
[grunts]

08:19.249 --> 08:21.292
But didn't have the sense to ask.

08:21.501 --> 08:22.419
Thanks, Dad!

08:25.005 --> 08:26.214
[clears throat]

08:26.297 --> 08:28.341
[narrator]
How to be a reporter.

08:28.967 --> 08:30.760
Ah, the journalist.

08:30.844 --> 08:33.471
Deeply do we revere
the finest practitioners

08:33.638 --> 08:35.682
of this most illustrious craft!

08:35.765 --> 08:39.769
Though even a certified hack
can pull a good six-figure income.

08:39.853 --> 08:43.148
Uh, we still don't know how to start.

08:43.231 --> 08:45.191
[narrator]
Chapter one:

08:45.275 --> 08:49.195
The reporter starts by finding a subject
upon which to report.

08:49.279 --> 08:50.947
Bingo!

08:51.448 --> 08:54.784
[narrator] The alert reporter
notes his subject's every move,

08:54.868 --> 08:56.619
missing no detail.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.621
3:15 P.M.

08:58.705 --> 09:02.125
An awesome dog was seen burying
a bone in a hole that was, uh...

09:02.208 --> 09:03.209
That was, uh...

09:03.293 --> 09:05.837
-Awesome?
-[P.J.] Works for me.

09:06.588 --> 09:07.881
[narrator]
Chapter two:

09:07.964 --> 09:11.051
Journalistic ethics and responsibilities.

09:11.134 --> 09:12.802
Don't get caught.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.810
[dog sniffing]

09:24.564 --> 09:25.774
[snickers]

09:25.857 --> 09:30.570
[barking]

09:34.824 --> 09:37.702
The awesome beast chased
the mailman and it was, uh...

09:37.786 --> 09:38.912
It was, uh...

09:38.995 --> 09:40.914
Well, how would you describe it, Peej?

09:40.997 --> 09:42.457
Um...

09:42.540 --> 09:44.459
-Awesome?
-Awesome.

09:45.251 --> 09:46.503
[narrator]
Chapter three:

09:46.586 --> 09:49.506
Grammar, spelling, and style.

09:49.589 --> 09:53.927
I before E except after C.
Next chapter.

09:54.010 --> 09:57.514
The dog removed a portion of the mailman's
pants that was...

09:57.597 --> 09:59.349
That was uh, uh...

09:59.432 --> 10:01.434
What's a word for "awesome?"

10:01.518 --> 10:03.269
How about awesome?

10:04.020 --> 10:07.273
Naw. Naw, naw.
Something... something bigger.

10:07.357 --> 10:10.193
I know! Very awesome.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.407
Oh, hurry it up, Goof!

10:15.490 --> 10:17.867
We got a schedule to keep,
deadlines to meet!

10:17.951 --> 10:19.035
News to make up.

10:19.994 --> 10:21.621
Careful, will you?

10:21.705 --> 10:24.708
I paid your hard earned money
for that copying machine.

10:32.215 --> 10:34.884
[grunts]

10:37.387 --> 10:39.305
[screams]

10:41.433 --> 10:44.019
Nothing to it. Ah-hyuck!

10:46.521 --> 10:49.983
[Pete] I'd like to see anybody
not see my ad now!

10:50.066 --> 10:54.154
Just make sure it comes out nice
and crisp and clean and big.

10:54.237 --> 10:56.322
-Here's the news that we...
-Yeah, yeah, right.

10:56.406 --> 10:58.033
Just don't disturb your old man.

10:58.116 --> 11:02.495
Now don't forget, Goofer,
my picture on every page!

11:02.579 --> 11:03.913
Let me see now.

11:03.997 --> 11:06.666
The paper feed's connected to the platen.

11:06.750 --> 11:08.460
The platen's connected
to the ink-well.

11:08.543 --> 11:11.838
The ink-well's connected
to the spray-hose...

11:11.921 --> 11:14.924
Say, lame brain,
are you sure you know...

11:16.343 --> 11:17.802
what you're doing?

11:17.886 --> 11:19.554
[tires squealing]

11:19.637 --> 11:24.184
All right. Now let's get out there
and sell, sell, sell!

11:26.936 --> 11:28.938
Paper, get your paper!

11:29.022 --> 11:31.191
Two for one sale, twice the news.

11:31.274 --> 11:32.567
Paper, mister?

11:32.650 --> 11:33.651
Paper, ma'am?

11:36.279 --> 11:39.491
Hmm. "Dog buries... [mumbling]

11:39.574 --> 11:42.077
"Awesome... awesome..."

11:42.160 --> 11:45.163
[woman] [mumbles] "Awesome."

11:45.246 --> 11:46.331
[man] I want my money back!

11:46.414 --> 11:48.416
[woman] And I want my money back.

11:48.500 --> 11:49.834
[man 1] I want my money back!

11:49.918 --> 11:52.003
[man 2] I've been cheated.
I want my money back!

11:52.087 --> 11:53.505
[woman 1] I want my money back!

11:53.588 --> 11:55.757
[man 3] You can't do this to me.
I want my money back.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.759
[man 4] I want my money!

11:57.842 --> 12:00.804

Let me see one of those!

12:10.105 --> 12:12.273
-Awesome?
-No. Awful!

12:12.357 --> 12:13.858
I want my money back.

12:13.942 --> 12:16.861
But, Pete, it's free to family members.

12:16.945 --> 12:20.490
This paper isn't worth
the paper it's written on!

12:20.907 --> 12:22.951
It's pitiful, it's preposterous.

12:23.034 --> 12:25.704
Why, it's downright putrid!

12:26.996 --> 12:29.833
Oh, Max? P.J.?

12:35.130 --> 12:38.758
Nobody's gonna see my ad
when it's in a piece of garbage

12:38.842 --> 12:40.593

12:41.344 --> 12:42.303
[sniffs]

12:42.387 --> 12:45.098
Hmm. Got sort of a
Lily-of-the-valley odor.

12:45.181 --> 12:46.433
But if you don't mind my saying,

12:46.516 --> 12:48.852
I think you were kind of hard
on Max and P.J...

12:48.935 --> 12:51.980
-Well, I do mind your saying!
-They're only kids, you know.

12:52.063 --> 12:55.066
Just too young to write a paper
people will want to read

12:55.150 --> 12:58.403
or know how to shave
with a razor or do taxes or...

12:58.486 --> 12:59.571
Say that again!

12:59.654 --> 13:01.489
Oh, well, they, uh,

13:01.573 --> 13:03.324
don't know how to shave off their taxes

13:03.408 --> 13:07.078
or read a razor
or do a thing so it comes out even or...

13:07.162 --> 13:08.747
Goof, you're a genius!

13:44.282 --> 13:47.744
I'm all ready for my interview.
[chuckles]

13:47.827 --> 13:51.039
Just don't be too rough. [laughs]

13:51.122 --> 13:53.166
Just a couple of questions, Mr. P.

13:53.249 --> 13:56.086
Ooh, Mr. P. I like that.

13:56.169 --> 13:58.213
Be sure and get my good side.

14:00.590 --> 14:01.925
In the last year,

14:02.008 --> 14:03.927
how much did you swindle
your customers out of?

14:04.010 --> 14:05.428
-Swindle?
-That's right. Bilk!

14:05.512 --> 14:06.596
-[P.J.] Scam.
-Hustle!

14:06.680 --> 14:07.847
[P.J.] Do you cheat on your taxes?

14:08.014 --> 14:09.224
-Ever lied to a customer?
-What...

14:09.307 --> 14:10.517
Ever told the truth to a customer?

14:10.600 --> 14:12.185
No! I mean, yes... I mean...

14:12.268 --> 14:13.937
-So you do lie?
-Yes! No!

14:14.020 --> 14:17.440
Yes... maybe... I don't know! I mean...

14:17.524 --> 14:18.441
Hold it!

14:18.525 --> 14:19.859
Hmm...

14:20.276 --> 14:22.529
I get what you're doing.

14:22.612 --> 14:26.616
Trying to dig up some dirt
to tantalize your readers, eh?

14:26.700 --> 14:27.951
[chuckles]

14:28.034 --> 14:31.037
Well, you're not gonna find
any muck to rake around here.

14:31.121 --> 14:33.164
Now what say you go out there

14:33.248 --> 14:36.376
and write about my nice,
clean cars at reasonable prices.

14:36.459 --> 14:40.463
And don't forget to mention how spic
and span those bathrooms are!

14:40.547 --> 14:44.634
Aw, the kids are already acting
like sleazy journalists.

14:44.718 --> 14:46.720
Ain't that cute?

14:47.595 --> 14:51.683
I didn't spend five years in grade school
to write about clean toilets!

14:51.766 --> 14:53.852
You heard what my Dad said.

14:54.602 --> 14:58.314
"Three-headed chicken
gives birth to hockey team."

14:58.398 --> 15:00.442
P.J., that's it!

15:00.525 --> 15:02.694
If we can't find anything
exciting to write about,

15:02.777 --> 15:04.112
we'll do what the pros do.

15:04.195 --> 15:05.530
We'll make it up!

15:05.613 --> 15:08.616
Oh, I don't know about this, Max...

15:09.534 --> 15:11.703
We'll have the whole town talking.

15:21.671 --> 15:24.883
Don't you think we're stretching
reality just a little far?

15:24.966 --> 15:27.969
Hey, if you don't stretch
the truth a little,

15:28.053 --> 15:29.721
nobody's gonna believe it!

15:29.804 --> 15:31.723
Well, if you say so, Max.

15:38.772 --> 15:40.899
There! That ought to do it!

15:40.982 --> 15:42.567

15:55.497 --> 15:57.916
Well, at least that works right.

15:57.999 --> 16:00.502

[chuckles]

16:00.585 --> 16:04.923
Goof, I want one of these stuffed

16:05.006 --> 16:06.591
Got it, Pete!

16:06.675 --> 16:08.718
We're ready! Start the presses!

16:08.802 --> 16:11.596
Now we're cooking with thick black ink!

16:11.680 --> 16:13.640
Set it for 1,000 copies.

16:13.723 --> 16:15.350
Oh, make it 1,001!

16:16.518 --> 16:18.186

familial resemblance

and that there mutant alien.

All these years, and you never once
told me you was a mutant alien!

me to your relatives.
