{\an1}\h\h\h\hI DON'T KNOW
IF I LIKE YOU READING

17:00.350 --> 17:02.150
{\an1}ALL THOSE CARDIOLOGY BOOKS.

17:02.220 --> 17:04.079
{\an1}\h\h\h\h\h\hNO, MOM,
IT'S VERY REASSURING

17:04.150 --> 17:06.089
{\an1}AND I'VE LEARNED
\h\hA GREAT DEAL

17:06.150 --> 17:09.190
{\an1}FROM THIS COW'S HEART I GOT
\h\h\hAT THE BUTCHER SHOP.

17:09.260 --> 17:10.790

17:10.859 --> 17:12.790

until the ribs swing open

17:15.230 --> 17:16.859
{\an1}like a rusty drawbridge.

17:16.930 --> 17:17.970
{\an1}OHH, NO!

17:18.030 --> 17:19.630
{\an1}BLOOD! UGH!

17:19.700 --> 17:22.540
{\an1}Next, make an incision
in the coronary art...

17:22.599 --> 17:26.410
{\an1}And we are back with more of
\h <i>People Who Look Like Things.</i>

17:34.180 --> 17:35.620
{\an1}OH, NO! NO!

17:35.680 --> 17:38.390
{\an1}SOMEONE TAPED OVER
\hTHE END OF THIS.

17:38.450 --> 17:41.720
{\an1}All we ask is to be treated
\hwith dignity and respect.

17:41.790 --> 17:43.560
{\an1}And a new candle
\h\hnow and then?

17:43.620 --> 17:45.090
{\an1}Yes, and a new... No!

17:45.160 --> 17:46.490
{\an1}( <i>audience laughing )</i>

17:46.560 --> 17:49.230
{\an1}OH, MY LITTLE MAGGIE.

17:49.300 --> 17:51.430
{\an1}I MAY NEVER HOLD YOU AGAIN.

17:51.500 --> 17:53.970
{\an1}EWW! STINKY PANTS.

17:54.040 --> 17:55.380
{\an1}\h\h\h\hNOW, MARGE,
IF THE UNTHINKABLE

17:55.440 --> 17:58.010
{\an1}\h\h\h\h\h\hSHOULD HAPPEN,
YOU'RE GOING TO BE LONELY.

17:58.070 --> 18:00.040
{\an1}HOMEY, I COULD NEVER RE-MARRY.

18:00.110 --> 18:01.040
{\an1}DARN RIGHT.

18:01.110 --> 18:02.310
{\an1}AND TO MAKE SURE

18:02.380 --> 18:03.610
{\an1}I WANT TO BE STUFFED
AND PUT ON THE COUCH

18:03.680 --> 18:05.350
{\an1}AS A CONSTANT REMINDER
\hOF OUR MARITAL VOWS.

18:08.120 --> 18:10.180

{\an1}BART, THE SADDEST THING
\h\h\h\h\hABOUT THIS IS

18:28.600 --> 18:31.710
{\an1}\h\hI WON'T GET TO SEE
YOU GROW UP BECAUSE...

18:31.770 --> 18:34.210
{\an1}I KNOW YOU'RE GOING
\hTO TURN OUT GREAT

18:34.280 --> 18:36.220

18:36.280 --> 18:37.380

18:45.250 --> 18:47.550
{\an1}\h\h\hYOU'RE ADOPTED,

{\an1}\hBUT DON'T WORRY,
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT

WHO LOVES YOU

18:52.760 --> 18:54.660
{\an1}\hAND WILL ALWAYS

\hSHOULD GO WRONG

19:08.040 --> 19:10.410
{\an1}\h\hLET'S NOT GET
THE LAW INVOLVED.

19:35.240 --> 19:36.600
{\an1}HELLO.

19:36.670 --> 19:39.470
{\an1}I THINK YOU TWO WOULD MAKE
\h\h\h\h\hA LOVELY COUPLE.

19:42.040 --> 19:43.180
{\an1}OH. THANK GOD.

19:43.240 --> 19:44.780
{\an1}I HOPE HE PULLS THROUGH.

19:44.850 --> 19:47.010
{\an1}NOT ME.
