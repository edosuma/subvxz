Hey, what do you need?

05:02.867 --> 05:05.034
- Um, a mechanic. I'm looking for a mechanic.
- Great.

05:05.036 --> 05:07.771
You just found the best goddamned
mechanic in town! Let's go.

05:07.773 --> 05:09.772
I'm driving to LA
and my car broke down.

05:09.774 --> 05:11.942
- Those guys would've fuckin' ripped you off.
- Really?

05:11.944 --> 05:14.610
- Oh, okay.
- Eat shit, Manny!

05:14.612 --> 05:16.680
- Richard, by the way.
- Oh. Nathan.

05:16.682 --> 05:17.617
Everyone
calls me Nat.

05:25.456 --> 05:29.159
Hey, you mind if I, uh, take a
couple of, uh, pictures of you?

05:29.161 --> 05:31.560
- You wanna take a picture of me?
- Yeah, yeah, of you.

05:31.562 --> 05:34.630
You're uh...
you're interesting, you know?

05:34.632 --> 05:36.166
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

05:36.168 --> 05:38.801
I mean, don't get me wrong, dude.
I'm interesting as fuck.

05:38.803 --> 05:40.904
- Yeah.
- If you wanna take a picture of the real deal,

05:40.906 --> 05:42.671
like, you came to the right place.
Let's do this.

05:42.673 --> 05:44.106
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Fuck, yeah.

05:44.108 --> 05:46.476
- Awesome. Great.
- This is crazy.

05:46.478 --> 05:49.478
- Okay.
- Fuck, yeah.

05:49.480 --> 05:51.748
- Nice.
- Yeah, right?

05:51.750 --> 05:53.149
- Okay.
- Yeah.

05:53.151 --> 05:54.920
This is America
at its purest, dude.

05:55.788 --> 05:57.590
Oh, nice. Okay.

05:59.690 --> 06:00.990
Yeah.

06:00.992 --> 06:02.993
- Cool, man. Let me see 'em.
- Huh?

06:02.995 --> 06:05.796
- Let me see 'em.
- No, this is... It's a film camera.

06:05.798 --> 06:07.163
- It's film.
- Oh, yeah.

06:07.165 --> 06:08.899
- Cool, man. Wow.
- Developing and everything.

06:08.901 --> 06:10.433
Yeah.
That's old school, huh?

06:10.435 --> 06:12.601
- Yeah, yeah.
- Crazy.

06:12.603 --> 06:14.171
What are you,
an artist or something?

06:14.173 --> 06:16.673
I'm gonna start art school.
That's why I'm driving to LA.

06:16.675 --> 06:18.007
- Fuck.
- Yeah.

06:18.009 --> 06:19.111
- Good for you.
- Thank you.

06:20.545 --> 06:23.012
- What's your philosophy?
- My philosophy?

06:23.014 --> 06:24.781
Yeah, like, your
artist's philosophy.

06:24.783 --> 06:26.983
What's your outlook on the world?
What do you got to say?

06:26.985 --> 06:30.786
Uh... I don't know.

06:30.788 --> 06:32.755
I mean, listen,
I'm not an artist.

06:32.757 --> 06:35.659
I'm like a fuckin' piece of
shit, you know. I'm a zero.

06:35.661 --> 06:37.627
- But even I've got a philosophy.
- Uh-huh.

06:37.629 --> 06:39.628
Three things matter in life.

06:39.630 --> 06:43.098
Friends, shelter, and a little
bit of food in my belly.

06:43.100 --> 06:47.637
Everything else, bro... is fuckin'
bullshit, and I'm at war with bullshit.

06:47.639 --> 06:50.005
- Everyone hates bullshit, right?
- Yeah. Right?

06:50.007 --> 06:53.909
If there's one thing I learned
in my 35 years on this planet,

06:53.911 --> 06:56.913
it's that this world
is full of fuckin' bullshit.

06:56.915 --> 06:59.849
Hey! Here we go.
Get ready.

06:59.851 --> 07:02.118
- Start it up.
- Oh. Oh. You sure?

07:02.120 --> 07:03.723
- Yep. Start it up.
- Okay.

07:08.593 --> 07:09.759
- You ready?
- Yeah.

07:10.928 --> 07:12.497
- Boom!
- Oh, my God, yes!

07:14.632 --> 07:15.467
Thank you.

07:16.100 --> 07:17.267
How 'bout that?

07:17.269 --> 07:19.002
I really
appreciate it.

07:19.004 --> 07:21.070
Yeah, don't worry about it.
Just a loose hose. Nothing.

07:21.072 --> 07:23.272
Yeah. Thank you. I never
would've found it myself.

07:23.274 --> 07:25.976
Listen, it's just, like, I don't
know, maybe a hundred bucks?

07:25.978 --> 07:29.045
Yeah, yeah. Of course, man.
Uh...

07:29.047 --> 07:31.748
- I'm fuckin' with you, man.
- What? What the...?

07:31.750 --> 07:33.283
I'm fuckin' with you.
Don't worry about it.

07:33.285 --> 07:36.853
Oh, my God, dude, that's so generous.
Thank you.

07:36.855 --> 07:40.656
- I wish there was something I could do for you.
- Oh. There totally is.

07:40.658 --> 07:43.793
I'm going about 45 minutes up
the road, town called Alpine.

07:43.795 --> 07:46.062
- Okay.
- If you wouldn't mind just giving me a ride.

07:46.064 --> 07:48.565
You can drop me on the side of the
highway near the town. That'd be fine.

07:48.567 --> 07:50.132
I just need to get there
pretty quick.

07:50.134 --> 07:53.969
Um... I don't...
I don't know, man.

07:53.971 --> 07:55.805
Yeah.

07:55.807 --> 07:57.940
- I don't know you...
- Enough said. I get it. You don't know me.

07:57.942 --> 08:00.844
You know, I'm a stranger.
You don't want me in your car.

08:00.846 --> 08:04.079
But look. Look in my eyes, man.
I have very kind eyes.

08:04.081 --> 08:05.884
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm a good guy.

08:07.052 --> 08:09.222
- What d'ya say?
- Um...

08:12.257 --> 08:15.291
You know what?
Yeah. Yeah, hop on in.

08:15.293 --> 08:18.163
- Come on.
- Fuck, yeah! Yes! You just made my day, man.

08:21.733 --> 08:23.265
You want a road brew?

08:23.267 --> 08:26.635
No-no, I'm good. I, I don't, uh...
not while I'm driving.

08:26.637 --> 08:28.605
- But you're more than welcome to do it.
- All right.

08:28.607 --> 08:34.176
You know, keep it low, just in case
there's any, uh, cops or anything.

08:34.178 --> 08:37.746
Don't worry about it. I'm pretty much at
professional level at drinking and driving.

08:37.749 --> 08:41.217
Well, good
thing you're not driving.

08:41.219 --> 08:44.186
So what's
your story, you party?

08:44.188 --> 08:46.222
Yeah. I mean,
I go to parties often.

08:49.260 --> 08:50.960
- What?
- Nah.

08:50.962 --> 08:53.662
I don't mean, do you go to
parties, like a sweet 16.

08:53.664 --> 08:55.665
I mean, do you party,
like, do you do drugs?

08:55.667 --> 08:57.700
Oh. Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:57.702 --> 09:00.369
- Cool. Fuck, yeah.
- Yeah. Weed and drink.

09:00.371 --> 09:01.938
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

09:01.940 --> 09:03.373
- Well, that's good news.
- Yeah?

09:03.375 --> 09:07.276
'Cause I happen to have
a pretty rad jazz cigarette.

09:07.278 --> 09:09.145
- Wow, that's awesome, man.
- Yeah.

09:09.147 --> 09:11.348
- You wanna piece of this?
- No, I'm driving. I don't smoke...

09:11.350 --> 09:14.153
- Mind if I smoke it?
- No, not at all. Please, go for it.

09:15.653 --> 09:16.855
So, where
you headed, man?

09:18.889 --> 09:20.890
- Vegas.
- Vegas.

09:20.892 --> 09:24.094
Yeah. Bright lights,
beautiful women.

09:24.096 --> 09:26.195
- Cool.
- It's the perfect place to start over.

09:26.197 --> 09:28.031
- That's awesome, man.
- Yeah.

09:28.033 --> 09:30.666
Yeah. I've never
been to Vegas.

09:30.668 --> 09:32.835
- You've never been to Vegas?
- No, no, no, no, no. Never.

09:32.837 --> 09:35.171
- Oh, dude, you gotta go to Vegas.
- Yeah. I know.

09:35.173 --> 09:37.339
I wanna go
for my 21st birthday.

09:37.341 --> 09:39.275
I know it's clichÃ© and
all that, but, you know?

09:39.277 --> 09:40.944
- Dude, that's smart.
- Right?

09:40.946 --> 09:43.246
- All of the best stuff in Vegas, you gotta be 21.
- Yeah.

09:43.248 --> 09:46.882
The bars, the casinos,
gambling, strip clubs.

09:46.884 --> 09:49.252
Dude, all the best hookers
are at strip clubs.

09:49.254 --> 09:50.420
- Good to know.
- Yeah.

09:50.422 --> 09:53.022
- Uh, good to know.
- Oh.

09:53.024 --> 09:54.690
Thank you.

09:54.692 --> 09:57.060
Maybe if I'm there, I'll look
you up and we can hang out.

09:57.062 --> 09:59.365
Yeah. Sure.

10:01.799 --> 10:03.266
Tell you what.

10:03.268 --> 10:04.968
I'm done
with all this bullshit.

10:04.970 --> 10:08.137
Nothing for miles,
small-town nonsense.

10:08.139 --> 10:09.939
Fuckin' assholes at work.

10:09.941 --> 10:11.840
Shitty jobs.

10:11.842 --> 10:13.245
Fuckin' terrible people.

10:15.413 --> 10:17.917
Vegas, baby.
From that movie?

10:25.190 --> 10:26.855
So, it's this building
right here.

10:26.857 --> 10:27.991
- Oh, awesome.
- Yeah.

10:27.993 --> 10:30.126
- Pull up right here on the right.
- Great.

10:30.128 --> 10:32.127
Thank you so much, Nat.

10:32.129 --> 10:34.296
This is... You really
did me such a solid.

10:34.298 --> 10:35.799
- I appreciate it.
- No problem.

10:35.801 --> 10:38.033
- You take care of yourself.
- You take care of yourself.

10:38.035 --> 10:40.236
This baby's gonna get you to LA
no problem now. Don't you worry.

10:40.238 --> 10:41.838
Thanks to you, man.

10:41.840 --> 10:43.706
Keep your dick dry out there.
You know what I'm saying?

10:43.708 --> 10:44.840
- Okay.
- Wrap it up.

10:44.842 --> 10:46.945
All right.
I will.

10:57.121 --> 10:58.256
Fuck!

11:06.865 --> 11:08.134
Hey, man, what's up?

11:09.400 --> 11:11.434
The whole thing's closed.

11:11.436 --> 11:13.402
I don't even think the fuckin'
busses come here anymore.

11:13.404 --> 11:15.171
- What the hell?
- What?

11:15.173 --> 11:17.206
Yeah. Fuck me.

11:17.208 --> 11:21.478
Oh, shit, man. Well, uh,
what're you gonna do?

11:21.480 --> 11:24.414
I-I'll probably just stay here the
night, and hitch in the morning.

11:24.416 --> 11:26.018
It's, like, not a big deal.

11:29.421 --> 11:33.022
You know what? Um, I'm
staying in Marfa tonight.

11:33.024 --> 11:35.224
If you wanna join... I don't
know if they have a bus station,

11:35.226 --> 11:36.493
but it's closer to Vegas.

11:36.495 --> 11:38.194
- You wouldn't mind, for real?
- Yeah, man.

11:38.196 --> 11:39.298
It'd be nice
to have some company.

11:40.432 --> 11:42.065
Okay. Here's one.

11:42.067 --> 11:44.233
What's your favorite movie
of all time?

11:44.235 --> 11:45.801
<i>The Graduate.</i>
Done.

11:45.803 --> 11:46.770
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

11:46.772 --> 11:48.103
- Never seen it.
- Really?

11:48.105 --> 11:49.839
I don't even know what it is.
<i>The Graduate?</i>

11:49.841 --> 11:51.507
- Dustin Hoffman. You know...
- I'll check it out.

11:51.509 --> 11:53.376
What about you?
What's your favorite movie?

11:53.378 --> 11:57.113
Uh, <i>Fast and Furious:
Tokyo Drift.</i>

11:57.115 --> 11:59.983
- Really?
- Oh, yeah. That movie is crazy.

11:59.985 --> 12:02.084
It's about these guys
and they race all these cars.

12:02.086 --> 12:04.454
And they, like,
they drift the cars.

12:04.456 --> 12:07.190
I mean, they're... they're all right...
those movies, to be honest.

12:07.192 --> 12:09.224
- I mean...
- <i>Fast and Furious One and Two?</i>

12:09.226 --> 12:11.127
Fuckin' the best movies
I've ever seen.

12:11.129 --> 12:13.563
I mean, they, like,
they lost their steam,

12:13.565 --> 12:15.531
like, by the time
they got to, like, six.

12:15.533 --> 12:17.233
I think they're on,
like, eight now.

12:17.235 --> 12:19.234
Wait.

12:19.236 --> 12:20.936
There's more
of those fuckin' movies?

12:20.938 --> 12:22.472
Yeah. There's,
like, eight more.

12:22.474 --> 12:25.007
Are you fucking...
Oh, my God!

12:25.009 --> 12:26.542
- Yeah, they added...
- That's fuckin' amazing!

12:26.544 --> 12:28.243
They got Dwayne
"The Rock" Johnson.

12:28.245 --> 12:29.546
- The Rock...
- Yeah.

12:29.548 --> 12:30.647
- ...from wrestling...
- Yeah.

12:30.649 --> 12:33.182
- ...is in <i>The Fast and Furious?</i>
- Yeah, I mean, yeah.

12:33.184 --> 12:34.818
Fuck. He's like
my favorite wrestler...

12:34.820 --> 12:36.219
It was sad when the guy
died, the main guy.

12:36.221 --> 12:38.153
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Don't tell me.

12:38.155 --> 12:40.190
- Who... In the movie?
- No, no, not in the movie.

12:40.192 --> 12:42.090
- Vin Diesel?
- Not Vin Diesel, the other guy,

12:42.092 --> 12:43.425
- but in real life.
- Brian?

12:43.427 --> 12:45.195
- Yeah.
- Brian died in real life?

12:45.197 --> 12:47.129
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God. Wow.

12:47.131 --> 12:50.366
They CGI'd his face 'cause he,
like, only shot half of the movie,

12:50.368 --> 12:53.102
and they did the rest
with his brothers.

12:53.104 --> 12:54.369
Very touching.

12:54.371 --> 12:56.375
- Dude, you are fucking blowing my mind.
- Yeah.

12:58.475 --> 13:00.343
We need some tunes
up in this bitch, right?

13:00.345 --> 13:01.877
Yeah, oh, totally.

13:01.879 --> 13:03.378
- Let's get it goin'.
- My girlfriend...

13:03.380 --> 13:06.882
Well, ex-girlfriend, gave me
this iPod as a going-away gift.

13:06.884 --> 13:09.118
- All right, let's see what we got.
- Yeah, check it out.

13:09.120 --> 13:10.887
Any Aerosmith on here?

13:10.889 --> 13:13.388
Uh, I don't know. I haven't
actually looked at it.

13:13.390 --> 13:16.025
Well, I hope there is, because
I'm in the mood for Aerosmith.

13:16.027 --> 13:18.594
- Ooh. I have an update.
- What?

13:18.596 --> 13:21.129
Your ex has shit taste in music.
This is garbage.

13:21.131 --> 13:22.464
Yeah. No, I know.

13:22.466 --> 13:24.533
There's, like, three Indigo
Girls records on here.

13:24.535 --> 13:26.102
Is that why you dumped her?

13:26.104 --> 13:27.603
- 'Cause I get it.
- No.

13:27.605 --> 13:30.339
No, no, no, no, no.
She, uh, she dumped me.

13:30.341 --> 13:32.307
Or, well, no,
it was kind of mutual.

13:32.309 --> 13:33.943
She made the decision.
Um...

13:33.945 --> 13:36.079
Ew. This is
not sounding good.

13:36.081 --> 13:38.547
No, no, no, no, seriously.
It was the right decision.

13:38.549 --> 13:40.282
So I'm-I'm totally fine
with it.

13:40.284 --> 13:41.917
Say no more. I get it.

13:41.919 --> 13:45.220
I'm just excited to start this
new phase, this new path.

13:45.222 --> 13:47.089
Yeah.
You should be.

13:47.091 --> 13:48.657
You're going to
fuckin' art school, dude.

13:48.659 --> 13:50.493
'Cause you know what
art school is full of?

13:50.495 --> 13:54.030
Hot girls, who, like, have those
weird, chunky, black glasses

13:54.032 --> 13:57.432
- and, like, black bangs and all this shit.
- Yeah, it's...

13:57.434 --> 14:00.469
All they're into is, like, doing threesomes
and being lesbians for a minute.

14:00.471 --> 14:02.171
- Wow.
- Like, you're gonna get crazy-laid.

14:02.173 --> 14:03.473
You eat pussy, dude?

14:03.475 --> 14:06.142
- Yeah.
- Okay, good.

14:06.144 --> 14:10.479
If there's one thing you walk away from this
conversation with is, you've gotta eat that pussy.

14:10.481 --> 14:13.449
You know, it's like, my-my last girlfriend,
she didn't really like getting eaten out...

14:13.451 --> 14:15.450
Okay. Time out.
Time out.

14:15.452 --> 14:17.420
Time out. I'm gonna
stop you right there.

14:17.422 --> 14:20.223
She likes getting eaten out.
You're just bad at it.

14:20.225 --> 14:21.657
Well, here's the thing, okay?

14:21.659 --> 14:24.227
The honest truth, you want
the honest truth right here?

14:24.229 --> 14:26.094
She's the only person
I've ever been with.

14:26.096 --> 14:28.031
Oh, dude, that's
not embarrassing.

14:28.033 --> 14:29.932
You're fuckin'... What are
you, 19 years old you said?

14:29.934 --> 14:31.501
- Yeah.
- Yeah. That's fine.

14:31.503 --> 14:33.435
Fuck,
I wish I had that.

14:33.437 --> 14:36.174
I fucked a bunch of dummies before I
fucked the one true love of my life.

14:37.341 --> 14:38.276
Shit, man.

14:41.245 --> 14:43.646
This is embarrassing. Fu... Fuck. I can't
even believe I'm about to tell you this.

14:43.648 --> 14:45.480
No, come on, tell me.

14:45.482 --> 14:48.685
I'm still, like, hung up on this
girl from when I was 15 years old.

14:48.687 --> 14:51.454
- I'm talkin' like 25 years ago, man.
- Wow.

14:51.456 --> 14:53.623
My high school sweetheart...
Sharon was her name...

14:53.625 --> 14:57.326
Ooh. She had, like,
this beautiful angelic face.

14:57.328 --> 15:01.030
- We just got each other. You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

15:01.032 --> 15:03.199
I feel like in an
alternative universe,

15:03.201 --> 15:07.570
- we'd be married and have kids and be real happy, you know?
- Yeah.

15:07.572 --> 15:09.973
It's, like, there was
this fork in the road,

15:09.975 --> 15:13.675
and on one side was this
beautiful paradise with Sharon,

15:13.677 --> 15:19.482
and on the other fuckin' side, is
just, like, 25 years of fuckin' shit.

15:19.484 --> 15:24.020
And I don't know why, but I fuckin'
chose the 25 years of shit.

15:24.022 --> 15:26.622
And sometimes I'm laying in
bed, trying to fall asleep,

15:26.624 --> 15:29.291
and I just think about
that universe with her,

15:29.293 --> 15:32.228
where it's just us
and we're happy.

15:32.230 --> 15:35.031
And I don't know what the
fuck happened, man. You know?

15:35.033 --> 15:36.435
Wow.

16:04.596 --> 16:07.229
Dude, is this the hotel?

16:07.231 --> 16:08.698
Yeah. I rented out
one of those trailers.

16:08.700 --> 16:11.666
Oh, no. I spent my whole life trying
to get out of a fuckin' trailer park.

16:11.668 --> 16:13.636
Now you're gonna make me
sleep in one again?

16:13.638 --> 16:18.306
What is this, some kinda fake poverty
bullshit your generation's into?

16:18.308 --> 16:23.079
I know it's corny and all,
but, you know, it's just fun.

16:23.081 --> 16:25.781
Hey, I gotta check in. Do you wanna come
in with me, or do you wanna wait out here?

16:25.783 --> 16:30.052
Uh, no thanks. I saw
a bar couple blocks back.

16:30.054 --> 16:33.224
- Why don't you meet me there in 30.
- Uh, okay.

17:05.690 --> 17:07.623
- Richard.
- Hey.

17:07.625 --> 17:10.125
- Hey, how's it goin', man?
- Good. What, did you get lost?

17:10.127 --> 17:13.395
Oh, no. That ex I was telling
you about, she called.

17:13.396 --> 17:17.132
- Dude, you gotta cut her loose.
- I know.

17:17.134 --> 17:20.169
- You're over 21, right?
- Mm-hmm.

17:20.171 --> 17:21.369
What'll you have?

17:21.372 --> 17:25.740
- We'll, uh, we'll get two whiskeys.
- Yep.

17:25.742 --> 17:29.114
- Holy shit, I didn't get carded.
- Yeah, okay, be cool.

17:30.414 --> 17:32.280
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah, thank you.

17:32.282 --> 17:34.619
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

17:36.753 --> 17:38.423
Oh!

17:40.258 --> 17:43.191
- We'll do two more of these. Make 'em doubles.
- Yeah.

17:43.193 --> 17:44.128
Thank you.

17:46.364 --> 17:47.697
- Mmm.
- Fuck.

17:47.699 --> 17:51.700
- What?
- I'm sorry, dude.

17:51.702 --> 17:54.569
- I just did a real fuckin' dick thing.
- No, what did you do?

17:54.571 --> 17:57.273
I ordered a bunch of drinks, and I've
only got ten bucks in my pocket.

17:57.275 --> 17:59.208
Oh, come on, don't worry about it, man.
I got the drinks.

17:59.210 --> 18:00.343
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

18:00.345 --> 18:01.677
You've already been
so fuckin' nice to me.

18:01.679 --> 18:03.845
Giving me a ride,
and all this other stuff.

18:03.847 --> 18:05.413
It's all good.
Don't worry about it.

18:05.415 --> 18:06.815
- No, no, no.
- What?

18:06.817 --> 18:08.517
Don't flash that kind of
money in a place like this.

18:08.519 --> 18:11.219
- What'd you do, fuckin' rob a bank?
- No.

18:11.221 --> 18:12.787
Jesus Christ.

18:12.789 --> 18:15.423
- Are you fuckin' rich?
- No.

18:15.425 --> 18:16.595
Oh, thank you.

18:17.595 --> 18:19.327
Your parents are rich.

18:19.329 --> 18:22.265
- Well, I mean, they're like upper-middle class-ish.
- Right?

18:22.267 --> 18:25.535
I fuckin' nail... I nailed it, man.
I got your number.

18:25.537 --> 18:28.304
So, I've had, like,
a pretty sheltered life.

18:28.306 --> 18:30.506
Everything's
planned out for me.

18:30.508 --> 18:33.209
You do well on your SAT's.
Graduate high school.

18:33.211 --> 18:34.943
You go to college.
You get a job.

18:34.945 --> 18:37.279
You get married.
Blah, blah, blah.

18:37.281 --> 18:42.785
And that's fine for some people, but that
type of life doesn't interest me at all.

18:42.787 --> 18:44.487
Yeah, I get it.

18:44.489 --> 18:46.322
No one had a plan for me.

18:46.324 --> 18:47.890
Nobody fuckin' expected
anything out of my life.

18:47.892 --> 18:49.324
Yeah. And-And see?
That's-That's my point.

18:49.326 --> 18:54.330
You're one of the realest people I
think I've ever met in my entire life.

18:54.332 --> 18:56.731
And I-I guess that's what I'm
trying to do with my photography.

18:56.733 --> 19:03.372
I'm trying to get to... to the-the
heart of real America, you know?

19:03.374 --> 19:05.641
And I feel like being
in here in this place

19:05.643 --> 19:08.844
with you right now, with all these people
around, that this is real America.

19:08.846 --> 19:10.379
Nat, I have an update.

19:10.381 --> 19:13.815
I think this might be
the asshole of real America.

19:13.817 --> 19:15.383
You're a good kid, Nat.
I like you.

19:15.385 --> 19:17.553
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

19:17.555 --> 19:19.822
I think the universe brought us
together for a reason, you know?

19:19.824 --> 19:21.356
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

19:21.358 --> 19:23.959
I will fuckin' rip the condom
off of your mind, dude,

19:23.961 --> 19:27.697
so you can fuck this world raw.

19:27.699 --> 19:30.600
I wanna see you fuckin'
raw-dog this world, man.

19:30.602 --> 19:31.834
That's what you're doing.

19:43.381 --> 19:44.980
Fuck the world raw.

19:44.982 --> 19:47.016
Did you guys
just fuckin' see that?

19:47.018 --> 19:48.718
- Fuckin' kid just took our photo.
- That's funny.

19:48.720 --> 19:52.287
Hey. You just take
my fuckin' photo?

19:52.289 --> 19:54.257
What the fuck
are you thinkin'?

19:54.259 --> 19:55.958
I-I'm sorry, yeah.

19:55.960 --> 19:58.526
What the fuck are you doin'?
Erase that.

19:58.528 --> 20:00.363
Got any fuckin' manners?

20:00.365 --> 20:02.731
This is a film camera.
I can't erase it.

20:02.733 --> 20:04.533
- Give me the fuckin camera.
- No, stop!

20:04.535 --> 20:07.769
Hey, leave the kid alone, okay?
He didn't mean anything by it.

20:07.771 --> 20:10.038
What the fuck are you
gonna do about it, huh?

20:10.040 --> 20:13.843
Okay. Just go back to your game
and play pool with your bros.

20:13.845 --> 20:15.745
Uncle Joe, Ryan, come here.

20:15.747 --> 20:17.646
You wanna meet my boys?

20:17.648 --> 20:19.448
Hey, Richard. Come on. Let's go.
Let's just leave.

20:19.450 --> 20:20.749
Oh, no, no.
Hang on, Nat.

20:20.751 --> 20:23.486
I'm about to meet
Uncle Joe and Ryan.

20:23.488 --> 20:24.789
You are.

20:28.459 --> 20:30.459
Richard.

20:30.461 --> 20:33.496
Richard, come on, let's go.
Please. I'm so sorry.

20:33.498 --> 20:35.567
Richard, please?
I'm so sorry.

20:39.002 --> 20:41.737
Yeah.
Yeah, we're gonna go.

20:41.739 --> 20:45.007
- What do you mean you're gonna fuckin' go?
- I'm sorry.

20:45.009 --> 20:46.310
Thank you, ma'am.

20:48.512 --> 20:51.314
- Sorry for the disturbance.
- Fuckin' pussy.

20:51.316 --> 20:52.681
- Ooh. One sec.
- Li'l fuckin' baby.

20:52.683 --> 20:53.884
What?

20:55.353 --> 20:57.990
- Oh, my God!
- Run!

21:00.557 --> 21:01.460
Go, go, run!

21:04.028 --> 21:05.564
I think we lost 'em.

21:09.634 --> 21:10.932
Oh, my God.

21:10.934 --> 21:13.035
Did you see that guy's
face when I hit him?

21:13.037 --> 21:15.504
Oh, fuck, man.

21:15.506 --> 21:17.640
- That... That was... That was cra...
- Did you get your camera?

21:17.642 --> 21:19.374
Yeah, I got it.
I got my camera.

21:19.376 --> 21:20.776
That was crazy though.

21:20.778 --> 21:23.879
That was not crazy.
That was just a bar fight.

21:23.881 --> 21:25.980
Come on. You've never
been in a fight before?

21:25.982 --> 21:27.449
How are you
so calm right now?

21:27.451 --> 21:28.817
How are you not?

21:28.819 --> 21:31.120
You know what?
Drink the rest of this, okay?

21:31.122 --> 21:33.355
- You need to relax, buddy.
- Yeah.

21:33.357 --> 21:35.891
I'll be back here,
taking a piss!

21:35.893 --> 21:38.361
Hey, don't come back here
unless you wanna see my dick.

21:38.363 --> 21:42.701
I don't wanna see your...
Ha ha! I'm so drunk right now.

21:44.836 --> 21:47.603
Hey, you think those guys
are gonna find us?

21:47.605 --> 21:49.705
The guys from the bar?

21:49.707 --> 21:52.574
Fuck, no. And by the way,
if they do, guess what.

21:52.576 --> 21:53.742
We'll just kick
their fuckin' asses.

21:53.744 --> 21:55.009
- Yeah? That's right.
- Boom!

21:55.011 --> 21:58.517
- You fuckin' hit him so fuckin' hard.
- Yeah.

22:00.017 --> 22:01.653
Whoo.

22:02.953 --> 22:06.889
I'm pretty fuckin'
hydrated today.

22:06.891 --> 22:10.025
Hey, man, you ever thought of
getting in touch with that girl

22:10.027 --> 22:12.661
- that you're still in love with?
- Who, Sharon?

22:12.663 --> 22:15.730
- Uh, Sharon.
- Fuck, no. Why would I do that?

22:15.732 --> 22:17.932
Well, because you're
still in love with her.

22:17.934 --> 22:20.068
You haven't tried to contact her once?
That's crazy.

22:20.070 --> 22:25.039
I've looked her up. But we had a pretty
bad falling out, so what's the point?

22:25.041 --> 22:27.142
You know where she lives
though, you looked her up.

22:27.144 --> 22:28.777
- Yeah, I looked her up.
- You looked her up.

22:28.779 --> 22:31.080
- Fine. Yes, I looked her up.
- So you know where she lives.

22:31.082 --> 22:33.082
Where does she live?

22:33.084 --> 22:34.616
Where does she live?

22:34.618 --> 22:39.087
227 Lojitas Lane.
Las Cruces, New fuckin' Mexico.

22:39.089 --> 22:40.456
Okay? You happy now?

22:40.458 --> 22:42.024
That's right off the I-10.

22:42.026 --> 22:44.660
- We should go visit her.
- No.

22:44.662 --> 22:46.862
Yes. Yes!
It's on the way to Vegas!

22:46.864 --> 22:49.565
No matter what, you're gonna drive
by there, so why not say hi?

22:49.567 --> 22:52.434
Why? Because I was a piece
of shit back then, okay?

22:52.436 --> 22:55.638
And, yes, I'm still a piece of shit,
but a very different piece of shit,

22:55.640 --> 22:57.472
one I would rather
she didn't see.

22:57.474 --> 23:00.678
- Just hit this and stop bothering me, okay?
- Okay. Here.

23:01.813 --> 23:03.115
You're bumming me out.

23:09.053 --> 23:10.819
I don't know, man.

23:13.657 --> 23:15.524
- You think I'm ugly?
- What?

23:15.526 --> 23:16.892
- I'm ugly.
- No!

23:16.894 --> 23:18.693
- I'm ugly now.
- No, no, no.

23:18.695 --> 23:23.599
When she knew me, I looked like
a good-lookin' kid, you know?

23:23.601 --> 23:28.504
I look in the mirror now and there's a
old, ugly-ass man staring back at me.

23:28.506 --> 23:32.074
I'm balding,
my hair is going gray.

23:32.076 --> 23:34.980
I'm shocked I get laid as much as I do,
which is, by the way, quite a bit.

23:36.247 --> 23:38.980
I don't think women
like me for my face.

23:38.982 --> 23:41.917
I think they just like the danger.

23:41.919 --> 23:43.552
- Oh, that's real sensitive...
- Can't breathe!

23:43.554 --> 23:45.054
You know what?
You're a fuckin' dick.

23:46.891 --> 23:48.157
You know what?
Fine. Fine!

23:48.159 --> 23:49.824
Fine, We'll go,
we'll see Sharon,

23:49.826 --> 23:51.160
then we'll see
who has the last laugh.

23:51.162 --> 23:52.694
So funny.

23:52.696 --> 23:54.532
All right, done.
We're done here.

23:55.532 --> 23:56.632
Time for bed.
Shut up.

24:01.672 --> 24:03.671
Wow.

24:03.673 --> 24:04.910
Oh, that's beautiful.

24:06.810 --> 24:10.211
- Oh, fuck. Birds?
- What?

24:10.213 --> 24:12.748
- What's wrong with birds?
- Oh. Nothing.

24:12.750 --> 24:15.183
No, no, Richard.
What's wrong with birds?

24:15.185 --> 24:16.619
Let's just go.
Come on.

24:16.621 --> 24:20.189
No, no, no. Richard.
Tell me. Come on, dude.

24:20.191 --> 24:22.290
Birds like that usually
means a storm's coming.

24:22.292 --> 24:24.727
It's an old Hopi legend.
Let's just go.

24:24.729 --> 24:28.764
Storms. Storm?
I don't see any storm.

24:28.766 --> 24:30.599
Yeah, well it doesn't
have to be a literal storm.

24:30.601 --> 24:32.668
It can be a metaphorical
storm or some shit.

24:32.670 --> 24:33.939
Let's just
get on the road.

24:36.807 --> 24:39.141
Goddamn it. Come on!

24:39.143 --> 24:40.511
All right.

24:47.218 --> 24:49.084
It's really cool

24:49.086 --> 24:51.554
that you know all about the Hopi
legend and stuff like that.

24:51.556 --> 24:54.189
Yeah, you're not doing your duty as a
goddamn citizen of the United States

24:54.191 --> 24:56.257
if you don't know
all the old Indian legends.

24:56.259 --> 25:02.297
Hopi, Apache, Sioux, Iroquois,
Choctaw, Cherokee.

25:02.299 --> 25:06.000
I mean, come on, these are the people whose
land we stole, whose women we raped.

25:06.002 --> 25:09.771
Not my ancestors.
I'm one-eighth Jewish.

25:09.773 --> 25:12.574
Besides, I don't think you're supposed
to call 'em "Indians" anymore.

25:12.576 --> 25:15.844
I think the proper term
is "Native American."

25:15.846 --> 25:19.718
Your generation
is 100 percent pussies.

26:46.336 --> 26:49.074
- Think we're here.
- Fuck.

26:53.411 --> 26:55.844
All right, let's slow down
with those, all right?

26:55.846 --> 26:57.379
- Oh.
- How many...

26:57.381 --> 26:59.847
Oh, dude,
I'm fuckin' nervous, okay?

26:59.849 --> 27:02.753
I'm in a real vulnerable state right now.
I need your support.

27:11.461 --> 27:13.862
- How do I look?
- You look great.

27:13.864 --> 27:16.699
You look fantastic.
You got your good shirt on.

27:16.701 --> 27:18.967
You...
You're doing great.

27:18.969 --> 27:21.103
- You mean that? You're not just saying it?
- No, I'm not just saying it.

27:21.105 --> 27:22.106
You look good.

27:24.275 --> 27:26.441
Fuck. Did you just see that? She
just walked past that window.

27:26.443 --> 27:28.309
- Did you see that?
- Yes. Yes, I did.

27:28.311 --> 27:29.878
And what are you waiting for?
Come on.

27:29.880 --> 27:31.412
Come on, big guy.

27:31.414 --> 27:32.683
- Okay.
- You got it.

27:33.317 --> 27:34.982
Here we go.

27:34.984 --> 27:36.285
Whoo. Wish me luck.

27:36.287 --> 27:38.319
- All the luck.
- Okay.

27:38.321 --> 27:39.256
Oh, boy.

27:41.092 --> 27:42.259
Oh, God.

27:47.431 --> 27:50.099
- I can't do it. Let's just go.
- What?

27:50.101 --> 27:51.400
What are you
talking about?

27:51.402 --> 27:52.901
Let's get out of here!

27:52.903 --> 27:55.804
- No. You gotta do it.
- Come on, man.

27:55.806 --> 27:57.405
I don't wanna
be here anymore.

27:57.407 --> 28:00.342
This is... What're you doing?
What're you doing?

28:00.344 --> 28:02.311
- Oh!
- Richard, you're making me do this.

28:02.313 --> 28:04.846
Do not go in...
Do not touch that door.

28:04.848 --> 28:06.148
- Fuck!
- For your own good.

28:06.150 --> 28:07.516
Dude.

28:07.518 --> 28:08.420
No, I...

28:14.057 --> 28:16.161
- Who are you?
- I'm Ashly.

28:18.194 --> 28:20.228
- Do you know Sharon?
- Yeah. She's my mom.

28:20.230 --> 28:21.199
Oh.

28:26.537 --> 28:27.337
Is she here?

28:30.240 --> 28:33.077
No, actually,
she's, um, she's dead.

28:35.112 --> 28:37.278
- Fuck.
- Oh, shit.

28:37.280 --> 28:39.248
Yeah, she died last year.

28:39.250 --> 28:42.517
Fuck. How?

28:42.519 --> 28:45.053
- She killed herself.
- What?

28:45.055 --> 28:47.421
Slit her wrists in the bathroom
and I was the one who found her.

28:47.423 --> 28:48.457
- Jesus Christ.
- Oh, fuck.

28:48.459 --> 28:49.792
I'm so sorry.

28:49.794 --> 28:51.459
Hey, who's at the door?

28:51.461 --> 28:52.830
Oh, hi, Mom.

28:54.798 --> 28:57.799
- Hi.
- Sharon?

28:57.801 --> 28:59.468
Wait.
You're not dead.

28:59.470 --> 29:01.335
Dead?
Oh, what the fuck? Ashly.

29:01.337 --> 29:03.407
- Whatever.
- Can I help you?

29:05.442 --> 29:06.310
It's Richard.

29:08.278 --> 29:09.978
- I'm sorry. I think...
- Wait!

29:09.980 --> 29:11.313
I think you have
the wrong person.

29:11.315 --> 29:12.381
No, no, no!

29:12.383 --> 29:14.119
It's Richard,
from high school.

29:17.855 --> 29:21.190
Richard. Oh. Wow.

29:21.192 --> 29:22.924
- In the flesh.
- It's you.

29:22.926 --> 29:24.526
- It is.
- And who's this?

29:24.528 --> 29:25.994
This is
my friend, Nat.

29:25.996 --> 29:27.496
- Uh...
- That's Sharon.

29:27.498 --> 29:28.963
Nathan,
but I go by Nat.

29:28.965 --> 29:31.566
- Yeah.
- Nathan, hi. Hello. Come in.

29:31.568 --> 29:34.303
Uh, you sure we're not
bothering you or anything?

29:34.305 --> 29:35.938
No. Come on in. Please.

29:35.940 --> 29:37.940
- Hi.
- Hello.

29:37.942 --> 29:39.978
- This is a surprise.
- Very nice to meet you.

29:40.944 --> 29:42.411
Wow.
Is everything okay?

29:42.413 --> 29:44.112
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

29:44.114 --> 29:46.849
No, we were just, you know,
driving through town,

29:46.851 --> 29:49.617
and, you know, Facebook sent me a
message that you lived near here,

29:49.619 --> 29:53.020
so I figured I'd stop by and
see if you wanted to catch up.

29:53.022 --> 29:55.923
- Facebook doesn't do that.
- Ashly, go do something.

29:55.925 --> 29:58.093
Well, I'll be in my room,
if you care or whatever.

29:58.095 --> 30:00.062
I'm sorry my daughter's
such a fucking brat.

30:00.064 --> 30:02.463
- Oh, that's okay.
- You know what?

30:02.465 --> 30:05.302
I was actually about to open up a
bottle of wine, if you want some.

30:06.403 --> 30:07.469
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

30:07.471 --> 30:09.270
- That sounds great.
- You want some too?

30:09.272 --> 30:12.240
Uh, ye... No, no.
I'm fine, thank you.

30:12.242 --> 30:14.209
So, wait.
He's not your son?

30:14.211 --> 30:16.311
Him? No.

30:16.313 --> 30:19.014
- Richard, hey, I'm gonna just be in the car.
- Yeah, I don't care, Nat.

30:19.016 --> 30:20.018
Yo!

30:21.218 --> 30:22.287
Come here.

30:29.993 --> 30:31.159
Shut the door.

30:36.299 --> 30:39.034
- Uh, ca... Should I?
- Yeah, totally.

30:39.036 --> 30:40.572
Just throw all that shit
on the ground.

30:41.538 --> 30:42.606
Okay.

30:50.647 --> 30:52.280
You smoke?

30:52.282 --> 30:53.483
Uh, no.
No, I'm fine.

30:55.152 --> 30:57.286
- What do you think they're talking about?
- Huh?

30:57.288 --> 31:00.255
What do you think
they're talking about?

31:00.257 --> 31:01.422
Uh...

31:01.424 --> 31:03.959
- Who's this?
- That's my husband.

31:03.961 --> 31:04.929
Oh.

31:07.064 --> 31:09.530
- Seems like a real asshole.
- What?

31:09.532 --> 31:13.501
Uh, he's a lucky guy, huh?
Have all this.

31:13.503 --> 31:15.469
- That's great.
- Yeah.

31:15.471 --> 31:17.038
What's goin' on over there?

31:17.040 --> 31:19.509
That is, I am studying for
my real estate license.

31:20.344 --> 31:21.479
Really?

31:22.712 --> 31:24.546
Yeah, really. Why?

31:24.548 --> 31:26.480
Come on.
That doesn't add up.

31:26.482 --> 31:29.517
Not the Sharon I knew.

31:29.519 --> 31:33.555
Sharon with purple hair, whose
favorite phrase was "fuck off."

31:33.557 --> 31:35.990
Who gave me a hand job under the
bleachers at the homecoming game.

31:35.992 --> 31:37.526
Oh, my God.
I cannot believe.

31:37.528 --> 31:40.328
- I haven't thought of that in so long.
- But you remember, right?

31:40.330 --> 31:42.631
Isn't it so funny when you
look back at the past,

31:42.633 --> 31:45.167
and you're, like, "Oh, my God,
I thought that was intimacy."

31:45.169 --> 31:47.736
You just, like, stabbing me with
two fingers over and over again.

31:47.738 --> 31:50.104
You were always like, "Cut your
fingernails," all that shit.

31:50.106 --> 31:51.640
I was like, "This hurts!"
That was...

31:51.642 --> 31:53.211
- The greatest.
- ...weird.

31:58.548 --> 32:00.148
So, you from around here?

32:00.150 --> 32:02.985
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm from Texas.

32:02.987 --> 32:04.553
But I'm moving to LA.

32:04.555 --> 32:09.056
I cannot wait to get the fuck out
of here the second I turn 18.

32:09.058 --> 32:11.125
Yeah, really?
Where you gonna go?

32:11.127 --> 32:12.496
Anywhere.
Just not here.

32:13.564 --> 32:16.597
I'm so sick
of my dumb friends

32:16.599 --> 32:20.768
and my dumb parents
and my dumb teachers

32:20.770 --> 32:23.771
and my dumb job
down at The Cone Zone.

32:23.773 --> 32:26.307
Maybe I'll go to LA too.

32:26.309 --> 32:30.048
I'll be an actress or on a reality
TV show or something like that.

32:32.082 --> 32:35.083
Hey, can you stay,
like, right there?

32:35.085 --> 32:37.018
Um...

32:37.020 --> 32:38.219
- Oh, yeah, totally.
- Yeah?

32:38.221 --> 32:40.188
Everyone always tells me
I should model.

32:40.190 --> 32:41.359
Oh, okay. Great.

32:49.066 --> 32:52.334
- How old are you, again?
- Fifteen.

32:52.336 --> 32:53.704
Well, I will be in two months.

32:54.704 --> 32:55.706
Mm-hmm.

33:01.577 --> 33:03.047
- Thanks.
- I'm on Instagram.

33:04.448 --> 33:08.449
Ashly Richards 42069.
Tag me.

33:08.451 --> 33:11.585
Can I get some more of that?

33:11.587 --> 33:13.421
- Richard.
- Oh, man!

33:13.423 --> 33:14.725
Why are you here?

33:16.460 --> 33:17.495
Oh.

33:19.630 --> 33:23.198
Of course.
Why am I here?

33:23.200 --> 33:25.433
Uh...

33:25.435 --> 33:28.038
I just...

33:29.705 --> 33:32.340
- I feel like I never...
- You don't have to...

33:32.342 --> 33:35.142
...said it then, and it's what you
always wanted to hear, but...

33:35.144 --> 33:37.514
- No. You did say it.
- I love you, Sharon.

33:39.482 --> 33:41.248
I've always loved you.

33:41.250 --> 33:45.623
You know, you're the...

33:46.824 --> 33:49.324
You're the love of my life,
you know?

33:49.326 --> 33:50.624
- Richard...
- And...

33:50.626 --> 33:51.793
Oh.

33:51.795 --> 33:53.661
When I see you here now,

33:53.663 --> 33:59.101
I realize this is the life
I was supposed to have.

33:59.103 --> 34:01.402
- You know, don't you ever feel like that?
- Richard.

34:01.404 --> 34:05.239
That, like, in another world, you and
me would be living in this house,

34:05.241 --> 34:08.242
and we'd have kids,
and we'd have a happy life.

34:08.244 --> 34:09.811
Richard,
I think you should go.

34:09.813 --> 34:12.146
Wait. Because
I said I loved you?

34:12.148 --> 34:13.648
No. I...
That... Uh, sorry.

34:13.650 --> 34:16.784
That... I'm-I'm try...
I'm trying to explain myself.

34:16.786 --> 34:19.253
- Wait-wait, no. I don't... I don't wa...
- I want you to take this...

34:19.255 --> 34:21.289
- What's that?
- ...and just go.

34:21.291 --> 34:22.757
What the fuck is that?

34:22.759 --> 34:24.726
- This... I'm just trying to help you.
- What the fuck?

34:24.728 --> 34:27.195
- Dude, I don't want your fucking money.
- Richard. Okay. Calm down.

34:27.197 --> 34:30.297
That's not why I'm here! I'm trying to
tell you I'm fucking in love with you.

34:30.300 --> 34:32.132
- I don't want your fuckin' money!
- Okay, Richard,

34:32.135 --> 34:33.702
I want you to... No, no, no!
Richard.

34:33.704 --> 34:35.637
No, please don't...
Don't touch me, okay?

34:35.639 --> 34:37.204
No. No, I'm not
touching you.

34:37.206 --> 34:38.739
- If you kiss me, you'll remember.
- What?

34:38.742 --> 34:39.840
You'll remember
what we had!

34:39.842 --> 34:41.175
When we were laughing!

34:41.177 --> 34:42.643
Please get out
of my house, Richard!

34:42.646 --> 34:44.378
Seriously, you're scaring me.
Okay?

34:47.518 --> 34:48.849
- Out of my house.
- Don't worry, I'm leaving.

34:48.851 --> 34:50.684
- Nat, let's go.
- What?

34:50.686 --> 34:54.322
You're a fuckin' bullshit
person, living a bullshit life.

34:54.324 --> 34:56.724
Your shitty little house
and your bullshit husband,

34:56.726 --> 34:59.528
- and your fuckin' mean tricks-playing daughter.
- Okay.

34:59.530 --> 35:00.795
You know what?

35:00.797 --> 35:02.463
When you're tired of
your fucking plastic life,

35:02.465 --> 35:04.599
just remember out there, there's
a man who fucking loves you,

35:04.601 --> 35:06.170
who'll always love you.

35:08.704 --> 35:10.240
I-I'm so sorry.

35:13.677 --> 35:14.842
Don't tell your father.

35:14.844 --> 35:16.680
Oh, my God.

35:19.182 --> 35:21.219
Fuck... me.

35:25.289 --> 35:27.655
I need a fucking drink.

35:27.657 --> 35:29.791
Why is there no fucking
booze in this car?

35:29.793 --> 35:32.760
Okay, just calm down, and then
tell me what happened, okay?

35:32.762 --> 35:34.862
- What happened in there?
- What happened was it didn't work, Nat!

35:34.864 --> 35:36.565
It didn't fuckin' work!

35:36.567 --> 35:38.869
Your big idea,
it didn't fuckin' work!

35:40.670 --> 35:42.804
I never would've come here
if it wasn't for you.

35:42.806 --> 35:44.873
Look, I-I feel awful.

35:44.875 --> 35:47.508
Just tell me
what I can do, okay?

35:47.510 --> 35:49.711
- You wanna make it up to me?
- Yes, I wanna make it up to you.

35:49.713 --> 35:53.581
You can get me a hamburger,
and a 12-pack of beer.

35:53.583 --> 35:54.719
- Okay. Sure.
- Make it a case.

35:59.523 --> 36:02.289
I haven't eaten fast
food in, like, ten years.

36:02.291 --> 36:06.327
My school made me watch this animal
cruelty video and, oh, I think it...

36:06.329 --> 36:08.362
- Hello?
- No, hey.

36:08.364 --> 36:09.731
Don't fuckin' yell at them.

36:09.733 --> 36:11.633
I'm not even yell...
I just said, "Hello."

36:11.635 --> 36:14.568
When they're ready, they'll say what's up.
Don't yell at them.

36:14.570 --> 36:16.871
- I literally just...
- <i>Thank you for choosing Bob's Burgers.</i>

36:16.873 --> 36:18.673
<i>Would you like to try
our famous taco burger?</i>

36:18.675 --> 36:20.307
Yes, we would.
Thank you.

36:20.309 --> 36:21.809
Uh, let's see.

36:21.811 --> 36:25.579
Two taco burger combos,
one Frito pie,

36:25.581 --> 36:29.416
and then, uh,
six-piece chicken nuggets.

36:29.418 --> 36:32.487
- <i>One four-piece chicken nuggets...</i>
- No-no, six... six-piece chicken nuggets.

36:32.489 --> 36:34.021
Hey, hey, hey.
Be nice.

36:34.023 --> 36:35.956
Six-piece, please.

36:35.958 --> 36:38.459
<i>Okay, your total's
gonna be $15.27.</i>

36:38.461 --> 36:40.561
- <i>Please drive to the second window.</i>
- No, stop! Stop! Thank you!

36:40.563 --> 36:42.664
- What the fuck, dude!
- What?

36:42.666 --> 36:46.668
He wasn't fuckin' done. You don't fuckin'
just take off. You say fuckin' "Thank you."

36:46.670 --> 36:48.702
I'm gonna say thank you right now.
The second window.

36:48.704 --> 36:50.604
No, you don't know
it's the same guy!

36:50.606 --> 36:54.041
You've never worked at one of these
places before, Nat, I'm sorry. I have.

36:54.043 --> 36:56.644
Sometimes it's one guy taking the order,
and another guy gives you the food.

36:56.646 --> 36:59.880
You say fuckin' thank you.
You have fuckin' manners.

36:59.882 --> 37:02.784
- I'm sorry this isn't your dad's country club, okay?
- Oh, my God.

37:02.786 --> 37:04.952
But when a guy takes your order
and fuckin' does your food,

37:04.954 --> 37:07.655
you say fuckin' thank you,
you say fuckin' please,

37:07.657 --> 37:11.059
because all day long they're getting
shit from fuckin' assholes like you.

37:11.061 --> 37:13.894
- Goddamn it.
- Okay. Sorry. I didn't mean to be an asshole!

37:13.896 --> 37:14.896
- Hi.
- Hi.

37:14.898 --> 37:17.798
- $15.27.
- Yep.

37:17.800 --> 37:19.700
Feel like I have to fuckin'
apologize for your behavior.

37:19.702 --> 37:20.871
Okay. Fuck.

37:22.706 --> 37:24.706
They're fuckin' human beings back there, man.

37:24.708 --> 37:26.608
Fuckin' human beings
making the food

37:26.610 --> 37:28.980
that you're gonna shove
into your stupid fuckin' mouth.

37:35.786 --> 37:37.485
Thank you.

37:37.487 --> 37:38.856
Thank you so much.

37:42.893 --> 37:44.092
Catch.

37:44.094 --> 37:45.762
Whoa, you blew it.

37:48.364 --> 37:51.766
Mm! You should come
to Vegas with me.

37:51.768 --> 37:53.568
- Right?
- Um, sure.

37:53.570 --> 37:55.603
We're fuckin' driving there
already.

37:55.605 --> 37:57.405
Like, fuck art school, man.

37:57.407 --> 37:59.039
We can have drinks
with show girls.

37:59.041 --> 38:00.974
We can go to the casinos.

38:00.976 --> 38:03.711
It'd be so fuckin' fun.
We'd have the best time.

38:03.713 --> 38:06.648
I... I bet we would.

38:06.650 --> 38:09.983
Just two fuckin' hustlers taking
over the-the city and desert.

38:09.985 --> 38:11.485
I'm not a hustler.

38:11.487 --> 38:13.521
Yes, you are.
Yes, you are.

38:13.523 --> 38:15.856
- You're an artist, right?
- Yeah.

38:15.858 --> 38:18.459
Yeah. What's a fuckin'
artist but a hustler, dude?

38:18.461 --> 38:22.563
Get used to it, 'cause that's what you're
gonna be doing for the rest of your life.

38:22.565 --> 38:24.898
- Okay.
- Plus, you know what?

38:24.900 --> 38:28.702
Anybody who wants a piece, guess
what they're gonna get? Boom.

38:28.704 --> 38:29.903
Dude, what the fuck?

38:29.905 --> 38:31.940
I'm gonna protect you.
Okay?

38:31.942 --> 38:33.842
- You're gonna hurt yourself.
- I'm not gonna hurt myself.

38:33.844 --> 38:35.943
- Put the knife away!
- If anybody fucks with you...

38:35.945 --> 38:39.079
- Okay. Yep.
- I'm gonna fuckin'... I'll fuckin' slit their throat.

38:39.081 --> 38:40.981
- Put the knife away!
- Slit their fu... Okay!

38:42.085 --> 38:43.717
- Jesus.
- Jesus Christ.

38:43.719 --> 38:46.086
Such a fuckin' baby
about the knife.

38:46.088 --> 38:50.795
I'm just showing you that I'm like,
like a big brother, I'm gonna...

38:53.663 --> 38:56.400
'Cause you're like...
I can tell. You're like...

38:58.467 --> 38:59.536
scared.

39:08.677 --> 39:11.612
I'm gonna sleep
for, like, ten minutes.

39:11.614 --> 39:14.749
And then I'll drive
and then you can sleep.

39:14.751 --> 39:15.717
- Okay.
- Okay?

39:15.719 --> 39:16.717
Okay.

39:16.719 --> 39:17.851
You're doing a good job.

39:17.853 --> 39:19.887
- You're a good kid.
- Thank you.

39:19.889 --> 39:22.690
You're a good kid, Nat.
You're a good kid.

39:22.692 --> 39:26.496
Just my little brother,
who I'm teaching everything to.

39:59.596 --> 40:00.630
Shit.

40:14.744 --> 40:17.211
Come on.
Okay, come on.

40:17.213 --> 40:18.612
It's time to go.

40:18.614 --> 40:20.215
What's going on?
What time is it?

40:20.217 --> 40:24.151
It's late, uh...
It's early morning.

40:24.153 --> 40:25.954
- Okay.
- Yeah.

40:25.956 --> 40:28.021
- Why aren't we driving?
- Because I need to sleep.

40:28.023 --> 40:29.858
- Fuck it. Come on.
- Okay.

40:29.860 --> 40:32.059
- I'll drive. I can drive.
- Nope. Let's, uh,

40:32.061 --> 40:33.730
let's put you to bed, bud.

40:35.632 --> 40:36.834
This way.

42:28.811 --> 42:29.746
Fuck.

42:35.918 --> 42:37.751
What's the matter,
won't start?

42:37.753 --> 42:39.354
Uh, no.

42:39.356 --> 42:41.722
- Fuck.
- Yeah.

42:41.724 --> 42:44.825
I'll take a look at it after
we eat our free breakfast.

42:44.827 --> 42:47.295
Right? They got a
waffle bar, you know.

42:47.297 --> 42:48.795
Come on,
let's go.

42:48.797 --> 42:50.664
I'm fuckin'
starving.

42:50.666 --> 42:51.902
Whoo!

43:00.110 --> 43:02.844
- You know you left this on the table upstairs?
- Oh.

43:02.846 --> 43:04.711
You don't have to
tip maids at motels.

43:04.713 --> 43:06.347
They're not actually
cleaning anything.

43:06.349 --> 43:08.152
All they do
is make the bed again.

43:31.306 --> 43:35.443
Shit, man, I'm sorry
I couldn't fix it this time.

43:35.445 --> 43:37.679
But, good news is,

43:37.681 --> 43:40.347
the universe just handed us
a day off in a pretty cool city.

43:40.349 --> 43:42.685
So, let's enjoy it, right?

43:47.456 --> 43:50.391
Get a picture of me
with this barbed wire.

43:50.393 --> 43:52.762
- Uh...
- It's fuckin' tough as shit, right?

43:55.898 --> 43:57.201
Yeah, sure.

44:01.704 --> 44:03.804
Oh. Oh, boy.
Here we go.

44:03.806 --> 44:05.108
Classic.

44:09.978 --> 44:12.148
- I know what'll fuckin' cheer you up, bro.
- What?

44:13.248 --> 44:15.048
Fuck Vegas.
I'm not goin'.

44:15.050 --> 44:16.217
Why?

44:16.219 --> 44:18.418
Because I'm gonna
go to LA with you.

44:18.420 --> 44:21.255
- Right?
- Yeah. That's great.

44:21.257 --> 44:23.958
- I can't believe it didn't occur to me before.
- It's fuckin'...

44:27.429 --> 44:29.229
Hello?

44:29.231 --> 44:31.134
Yeah, hi, this is Nat.

44:33.902 --> 44:34.871
Okay.

44:36.739 --> 44:40.276
Uh-huh. Yeah.
Okay. Thank you.

44:41.244 --> 44:42.146
Bye.

44:43.246 --> 44:45.479
Fuck.

44:45.481 --> 44:47.481
It'll cost more to fix
the car than it's worth.

44:47.483 --> 44:50.251
Yeah. I'm not surprised.

44:50.253 --> 44:53.019
I'm so fucked. Classes start
in, like, three days.

44:53.021 --> 44:55.889
You know what?
I'm just gonna...

44:55.891 --> 44:58.492
I'm gonna go back to the hotel
and call my parents, okay?

44:58.494 --> 45:00.862
Seriously?

45:00.864 --> 45:04.097
Things get a little hard and you fuckin'
bail and go call Mommy and Daddy?

45:04.099 --> 45:06.467
- What would you do?
- What would I do?

45:06.469 --> 45:10.403
I'd go to the fuckin' bar, have a
couple drinks, fuckin' chill out,

45:10.405 --> 45:14.474
and then tomorrow, I swear to God, I
will put you on a bus to LA myself.

45:14.476 --> 45:17.778
- Yeah, but what about all my stuff in my van?
- Fuck that stuff.

45:17.780 --> 45:19.847
- You don't need it.
- I need some of it.

45:19.849 --> 45:22.784
Great. Take that and leave the rest.
Who cares? Come on.

45:22.786 --> 45:24.885
Come on, what're you doing?
Come on. Let's go.

45:24.887 --> 45:27.354
You got this. You got this.

45:27.356 --> 45:31.258
To LA, man, where everything's
gonna go fuckin' great for us.

45:31.260 --> 45:32.559
If we ever
make it there.

45:32.561 --> 45:34.364
Oh, we're gonna make it.
Don't you worry.

45:36.065 --> 45:38.199
You need to be more Zen
about how things happen.

45:38.201 --> 45:39.769
You know,
you get real down and...

45:43.206 --> 45:44.838
Can I have a tequila
soda, please?

45:44.840 --> 45:46.039
Can I have a beer,
please?

45:46.041 --> 45:48.376
- Hey.
- What?

45:48.378 --> 45:49.947
Check out these girls
over here.

45:52.548 --> 45:54.981
That girl just smiled at me.

45:54.983 --> 45:56.550
What about Sharon?

45:56.552 --> 45:58.853
Sharon? Come on, man.
That was yesterday.

45:58.855 --> 46:00.253
I'm moving forward
with my life.

46:00.255 --> 46:02.123
I'm trying to do
something new now.

46:02.125 --> 46:03.827
Where they goin'?

46:05.228 --> 46:07.228
- Let's go talk to them.
- No.

46:07.230 --> 46:08.929
- Come on, come on, come on.
- No, no. I'm good.

46:08.931 --> 46:10.463
I'm gonna just
stay right here.

46:10.465 --> 46:12.599
I don't feel like talking
to anyone right now.

46:12.601 --> 46:14.568
What's the matter with you, dude?
Come on.

46:14.570 --> 46:17.271
- No, I'm sorry. I just...
- There are cute girls here and they smiled at us.

46:17.273 --> 46:19.407
- I'm sorry.
- That's a signal.

46:19.409 --> 46:21.409
- Mm.
- You know what? Fine, forget it.

46:21.411 --> 46:23.510
You sit here and mope
while I go talk to those girls.

46:23.512 --> 46:25.847
I'm just saying...

46:25.849 --> 46:27.417
It'd be a lot more fun
if you were there.

46:33.088 --> 46:34.322
Hey.

46:34.324 --> 46:35.555
Nice.

46:35.557 --> 46:37.291
- This is so stupid.
- I know, right?

46:37.293 --> 46:39.463
Let's do it.

46:42.498 --> 46:43.998
Ladies.

46:44.000 --> 46:45.432
- How ya doin'?
- Hey.

46:45.434 --> 46:47.235
I'm Richard.
This is Nat.

46:47.237 --> 46:48.635
- I'm Nina.
- Hey.

46:48.637 --> 46:50.070
- Hey.
- Rebecca.

46:50.072 --> 46:51.371
You mind if we join you

46:51.373 --> 46:52.974
and maybe get you a drink
or something?

46:52.976 --> 46:54.575
- Absolutely.
- Oh.

46:54.577 --> 46:56.644
- Fuck, yeah.
- Great.

46:56.646 --> 47:00.150
Nat, why don't you go, uh, why
don't you get us those drinks.

47:02.150 --> 47:04.050
I'll come with you.

47:04.052 --> 47:05.186
Oh? Yeah.

47:05.188 --> 47:06.390
Okay.

47:09.157 --> 47:10.992
- Hi.
- Four shots of whiskey.

47:10.994 --> 47:12.129
Thanks.

47:13.528 --> 47:15.295
- Is that okay with you?
- Yeah.

47:15.297 --> 47:16.465
Yeah, yeah, of course.

47:17.967 --> 47:19.036
Mmm.

47:21.003 --> 47:23.371
- You guys live around here?
- No.

47:23.373 --> 47:25.106
We're just
traveling through.

47:25.108 --> 47:26.374
- Oh.
- Yeah.

47:26.376 --> 47:28.642
What about you guys?

47:28.644 --> 47:31.112
Just doing a little road
trip with my sister.

47:31.114 --> 47:32.612
Nice.
Where you guys headed?

47:32.614 --> 47:34.048
You can keep the change.

47:34.050 --> 47:36.083
- We're driving back to LA.
- Really?

47:36.085 --> 47:37.952
No way.
That's where I'm headed.

47:37.954 --> 47:39.519
Uh, starting college,
art school.

47:39.521 --> 47:42.155
Shut the fuck up.
I'm finishing art school.

47:42.157 --> 47:43.990
- Really?
- Going into my last semester.

47:43.992 --> 47:46.059
- Dude, that's hilarious.
- That's cool.

47:46.061 --> 47:48.162
I know, right? Uh...

47:48.164 --> 47:50.463
- Yeah. I go to Cal Arts.
- What kind of art do you do?

47:50.465 --> 47:52.700
I can't believe you guys are
staying in the same motel as us.

47:52.702 --> 47:54.401
- I know. Isn't that crazy?
- That's insane.

47:54.403 --> 47:56.304
- You are?
- Yeah.

47:56.306 --> 47:59.606
- Guys, this is like fate or some...
- Fate.

47:59.608 --> 48:00.708
- Whoa.
- What the fuck?

48:00.710 --> 48:03.177
This is weird.
This is now officially...

48:03.179 --> 48:04.644
- We... Guys, a toast.
- Oh, my God.

48:04.646 --> 48:07.550
All right? A toast to
fate and new friends.

48:09.184 --> 48:11.087
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

48:14.157 --> 48:15.722
Arrrr! Ooh!

48:15.724 --> 48:18.092
- Whoo.
- Ooh-wee!

48:18.094 --> 48:20.260
Oh, uh, so to answer your question.

48:20.262 --> 48:21.461
Yeah.

48:21.463 --> 48:23.197
Um, I take
a cross-disciplinary approach.

48:23.199 --> 48:26.333
So like, the work exists between
paintings and performance.

48:26.335 --> 48:27.735
- Oh.
- I don't know.

48:27.737 --> 48:30.037
I don't want it to be any
one thing, you know?

48:30.039 --> 48:32.206
Becs, no one understands what
the fuck you're talking about.

48:32.208 --> 48:35.443
What she does is she makes paintings based on her dreams.

48:35.445 --> 48:37.077
- That's her thing.
- Whoa.

48:37.079 --> 48:39.380
- Oh. Okay.
- I mean, no, it's not that simple.

48:39.382 --> 48:40.748
It's an easier way
of saying it.

48:40.750 --> 48:41.749
No, it's not.

48:41.751 --> 48:42.653
Whatever.

48:44.987 --> 48:48.322
Okay, she's mad at me because she
takes everything very seriously.

48:48.324 --> 48:51.224
He's the exact same.

48:51.226 --> 48:54.662
He gets all uptight
about stuff all the time.

48:54.664 --> 48:59.200
This might be weird, or like some
junior high shit or something,

48:59.202 --> 49:00.700
but this is a great song.

49:00.702 --> 49:02.135
- May I have this dance?
- Yeah.

49:02.137 --> 49:03.737
Fuckin' right on.

49:03.739 --> 49:06.673
I promise I'll bring her back
in one piece. Maybe.

49:06.675 --> 49:07.742
Hey!

49:07.744 --> 49:10.010
Uh-oh.

49:10.012 --> 49:12.281
I like you.
You're feisty.

49:13.782 --> 49:16.684
- I'm gonna go get us another round. Okay?
- Yeah. Okay.

49:16.686 --> 49:19.420
Uh, sure.
Do you...

49:19.422 --> 49:21.023
Do you need...

49:36.438 --> 49:37.637
- Oh...
- Okay, here we go.

49:37.639 --> 49:39.807
Sorry.
I should've helped you.

49:39.809 --> 49:42.376
Oh. No, it's okay.
I still have a tab open.

49:42.378 --> 49:43.610
You wanna take one?

49:43.612 --> 49:44.714
Sure, yeah.

49:48.050 --> 49:49.753
- To art.
- To art.

50:01.697 --> 50:04.231
I have no idea why I agreed
to let her drive with me.

50:04.233 --> 50:05.766
I'm going crazy.

50:05.768 --> 50:08.269
I feel the same way.

50:08.271 --> 50:10.574
It's the grind of the road,
you know? Takes its toll.

50:11.807 --> 50:13.507
Yep.

50:15.344 --> 50:18.079
Oh, my God. I love this song.

50:18.081 --> 50:23.249
Do you wanna dance to it,
the song, uh, with me?

50:23.251 --> 50:24.717
Yeah.

50:24.719 --> 50:28.121
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

50:28.123 --> 50:29.690
Okay.

50:29.692 --> 50:32.126
Milady.

50:56.751 --> 50:58.387
Ow!

51:05.728 --> 51:09.295
Hey, Nat,
Richard told me about your car.

51:09.297 --> 51:11.764
You guys should just
come with us.

51:11.766 --> 51:14.534
They're not listening to you.

51:40.496 --> 51:43.467
You are going to have
so much fun in college.

51:44.867 --> 51:46.800
I really hope so.

51:46.802 --> 51:48.434
You will.

51:48.436 --> 51:50.271
I know it's hard to imagine,

51:50.273 --> 51:52.405
but especially since
you're going to art school too.

51:52.407 --> 51:57.246
It's... It's an entire school
filled with weirdos, like us.

51:59.315 --> 52:02.686
Hey, can I...
Can I take your picture?

52:05.820 --> 52:07.787
- Right now?
- Come on.

52:07.789 --> 52:09.690
Come on, just stand right there.
It'll be fine.

52:09.692 --> 52:11.358
Uh, but I hate having
my picture taken.

52:11.360 --> 52:13.626
- Oh, why? You're beautiful.
- Oh!

52:13.628 --> 52:16.664
- You're gorgeous. You... You...
- You're...

52:16.666 --> 52:19.603
You are the prettiest girl
I've ever met.

52:20.603 --> 52:22.603
- Okay, fine.
- Yeah?

52:22.605 --> 52:24.173
Okay.

52:28.945 --> 52:30.644
Amazing.

52:30.646 --> 52:32.615
That was such hard work.

52:37.552 --> 52:38.755
Ooh.

52:40.422 --> 52:41.655
All right.

52:41.657 --> 52:43.824
Into my room, we go.

52:45.860 --> 52:46.827
Into my room...

52:46.829 --> 52:47.827
Whoa!

52:47.829 --> 52:50.630
Come on! In or out, guy?

52:50.632 --> 52:51.898
Wow!

52:55.871 --> 52:57.537
- Ew! Oh, my God.
- Oh, my gosh!

52:57.539 --> 52:59.340
- That's incredible!
- I guess we should go to my room.

52:59.342 --> 53:00.744
That's... Oh, my God.

53:05.248 --> 53:06.516
Can I kiss you?

53:07.849 --> 53:09.318
Yeah.

53:19.996 --> 53:21.662
Hey, Nat, get out here.

53:21.664 --> 53:23.563
Wait.
Do you hear that?

53:23.565 --> 53:25.865
N-No.

53:27.369 --> 53:29.940
No, I... I think
there's someone there.

53:32.574 --> 53:33.509
Okay.

53:35.543 --> 53:38.579
- What do you want, Richard?
- Hey, come here. It's an emergency.

53:38.581 --> 53:40.481
- What?
- Hey.

53:40.483 --> 53:43.450
Don't be a dummy, okay?
Wrap it up.

53:43.452 --> 53:44.818
- Thanks, Richard.
- Hey.

53:44.820 --> 53:47.320
- I'm proud of you, kid.
- Okay.

53:47.322 --> 53:48.692
Okay.

53:51.661 --> 53:52.793
What did he want?

53:52.795 --> 53:55.365
Uh, who knows?

53:56.364 --> 53:58.567
- Hey.
- I'm so tired.

53:59.635 --> 54:01.338
I'm gonna
shut the light off.

54:06.409 --> 54:08.010
- Wait, come here.
- Yeah.

54:09.577 --> 54:12.679
Boop.

54:12.681 --> 54:14.750
- Good night.
- Good night.

54:39.007 --> 54:40.974
- Hey.
- Hey.

54:40.976 --> 54:42.376
Took you long enough.

54:42.378 --> 54:43.976
- Well, well, well.
- Hi.

54:43.978 --> 54:47.548
Look who decided
to join the living.

54:47.550 --> 54:50.550
- Hey. How ya feelin'?
- Hi. I'm all right. You?

54:50.552 --> 54:52.786
- You were talking so much in your sleep last night.
- I was?

54:52.788 --> 54:54.688
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God. I just remembered.

54:54.690 --> 54:56.690
I had the fucking
craziest dream last night.

54:56.692 --> 54:58.559
Yeah. Uh,
I'll tell ya in a second.

54:58.561 --> 55:01.561
Right now, Nat, would you please
join me at the waffle bar?

55:01.563 --> 55:03.097
Great, thanks.

55:03.099 --> 55:04.630
- Uh, oh.
- Hey!

55:04.632 --> 55:06.032
Watch it, you.

55:06.034 --> 55:08.034
- Don't start something you're not gonna finish.
- Ha ha.

55:08.036 --> 55:09.836
- So, yeah.
- So, how'd it go?

55:09.838 --> 55:11.771
Did you use that condom
I gave you, or what?

55:11.773 --> 55:13.005
- No.
- No?

55:13.007 --> 55:14.508
- No, I didn't.
- Too bad.

55:14.510 --> 55:17.610
I didn't use anything.

55:18.713 --> 55:20.447
We made out, a little.

55:20.449 --> 55:21.581
- Yes.
- I know.

55:21.583 --> 55:22.816
- That's awesome, dude.
- Oh, my God.

55:22.818 --> 55:24.418
- It was so nice.
- Nice work.

55:24.420 --> 55:26.820
So, listen.
I, uh...

55:26.822 --> 55:29.423
I'm gonna need your help
with something right now, man.

55:29.425 --> 55:30.958
Yeah?
What do you need?

55:30.960 --> 55:35.065
Well, I'm about to ask Nina to
marry me, right here, right now.

55:37.565 --> 55:39.133
Oh, wait.
You're... You're serious.

55:39.135 --> 55:40.867
Fuckin'-A right on,
I am, dude.

55:40.869 --> 55:42.403
I'm in love
with this girl.

55:42.405 --> 55:44.405
I have been since the second
she walked into that bar.

55:44.407 --> 55:46.907
Okay.
Plus, check it out.

55:46.909 --> 55:48.941
- I got her this sweet ring at the gas station this morning.
- No, no.

55:48.943 --> 55:51.043
- She's gonna love it.
- Buddy, I think you're being a little impulsive.

55:51.045 --> 55:52.780
- It's happening.
- No, no. You do it at a later time.

55:52.782 --> 55:53.880
Ladies.

55:55.684 --> 55:59.452
If I could interrupt your
adorable giggling for a second,

55:59.454 --> 56:00.824
I have an announcement.

56:03.525 --> 56:05.726
Nina.

56:05.728 --> 56:07.927
I know that we haven't known
each other that long,

56:07.929 --> 56:11.932
and this might seem like it's
coming outta the blue, but...

56:11.934 --> 56:13.934
- What're you doing?
- Richard, hey...

56:13.936 --> 56:16.036
- Shh. Nat, hang on.
- Buddy, nope.

56:16.038 --> 56:18.438
- Hold on. Shh!
- Not right now. I'm in the middle of something.

56:18.440 --> 56:21.909
You know the phrase, "Sometimes
when you know you just know"?

56:21.911 --> 56:24.177
Well, I know.

56:24.179 --> 56:27.113
I love you.
And I can tell you love me.

56:28.717 --> 56:33.987
So will you do me the honor
of marrying me?

56:33.989 --> 56:38.492
Oh. Oh, my God, you got
me the special ring.

56:38.494 --> 56:41.561
It's so cute. Did you get
this at the gas station?

56:41.563 --> 56:42.998
Don't laugh.

56:45.034 --> 56:47.133
- Get up! Come on. Don't be silly.
- No.

56:47.135 --> 56:49.735
I'm serious.

56:49.737 --> 56:51.070
This is real. I...

56:51.072 --> 56:52.775
Come on, get up.

56:55.744 --> 56:57.945
Yeah.
No, you know what?

56:57.947 --> 56:59.679
You don't have to decide now.

56:59.681 --> 57:02.818
I'll-I'll just hold onto
this until you decide.

57:10.759 --> 57:13.630
Wait. What about, uh...
what about your dream?

57:15.130 --> 57:16.766
Oh, yeah, your dream.

57:18.967 --> 57:20.266
Oh.

57:20.268 --> 57:22.603
Yeah. Right.

57:22.605 --> 57:25.037
Okay.

57:25.039 --> 57:27.206
It's pretty fuckin' crazy.

57:27.208 --> 57:33.146
So, in the dream, I'm on tour
with The Rolling fuckin' Stones.

57:33.148 --> 57:36.516
- Oh, I love The Rolling Stones.
- Of course you do.

57:36.518 --> 57:39.952
Anyway, so, I'm hitchhiking
on the highway, no cars,

57:39.954 --> 57:43.824
and then all of a sudden, huge
black tour bus pulls up, right?

57:43.826 --> 57:46.994
Door opens, so fuck it.
I get in.

57:46.996 --> 57:48.829
And I come face-to-face
with the guys.

57:48.831 --> 57:51.063
Keith fuckin' pulls out
a guitar,

57:51.065 --> 57:53.967
hands it to me,
'cause he wants to jam.

57:53.969 --> 57:59.139
Which is crazy, because I know how to
play every single Rolling Stones song,

57:59.141 --> 58:01.108
even though A,
I don't play guitar,

58:01.110 --> 58:05.711
and B, I probably haven't listened
to The Stones in like, 15 years.

58:05.713 --> 58:07.313
Why, you don't like them
or something?

58:07.315 --> 58:10.316
Are you kidding? I fuckin'
love The Rolling Stones.

58:10.318 --> 58:13.653
They're the fuckin' best
rock band in history.

58:13.655 --> 58:15.688
And before you say anything
about The fuckin' Beatles,

58:15.690 --> 58:17.257
you can shut
your goddamn mouth,

58:17.259 --> 58:20.693
because they'd be a hack pop band
without George Martin, okay?

58:20.695 --> 58:23.697
I just don't like what The
Stones stand for, at this point.

58:23.699 --> 58:26.833
What do they stand for?

58:26.835 --> 58:31.037
They stand for the fact that my
generation, your generation,

58:31.039 --> 58:34.173
- and their shitty generation has utterly failed to produce...
- Whoa.

58:34.175 --> 58:37.077
...a rock band the caliber
of The Rolling Stones.

58:37.079 --> 58:40.780
There is no band that people remember
now, never mind in 30 years.

58:40.782 --> 58:43.316
Are you fucking kidding?
Fuck The Stones.

58:43.318 --> 58:45.017
So let me get this straight.

58:45.019 --> 58:48.921
Because you hate every band but
The Stones, you hate The Stones.

58:48.923 --> 58:50.724
See? You get it.

58:50.726 --> 58:54.193
And believe me, I'm so fuckin'
tired of women saying

58:54.195 --> 58:57.130
they still find these
old men sexy.

58:57.132 --> 58:59.066
Like Mick's strutting up there,
and they're like,

58:59.068 --> 59:01.034
"Oh, I'm still fuckin'
turned on by him."

59:01.036 --> 59:03.003
No you're not.
No you're fuckin' not.

59:03.005 --> 59:04.938
These are old geezers.

59:04.940 --> 59:07.840
And even if you found yourself in
some groupie situation with them,

59:07.842 --> 59:09.611
their dicks wouldn't
even fuckin' work.

59:11.614 --> 59:12.845
I'd still fuck Mick.

59:24.360 --> 59:25.929
- Fuck you, cunt.
- Whoa.

59:28.097 --> 59:30.396
Rebecca, wait.
Please don't go.

59:30.398 --> 59:33.900
Rebecca, is there any way
I can still go with you guys?

59:33.902 --> 59:35.302
- Unlock the car.
- I did!

59:35.304 --> 59:36.403
- Rebecca, please.
- Nina, wait.

59:36.405 --> 59:39.139
- Richard, don't! Please.
- I'm sorry.

59:39.141 --> 59:41.208
- I'll do whatever you need.
- Nat, just call me.

59:41.210 --> 59:43.010
- I don't have your number.
- Becca, just go.

59:43.012 --> 59:44.778
- Nina, I'm sorry.
- Please.

59:44.780 --> 59:46.412
- Hey! I love you.
- Rebecca, please.

59:46.414 --> 59:48.682
- Get away from the car.
- I love you. I'm sorry.

59:48.684 --> 59:51.017
- Just open the door. Talk to me.
- Get away from the car!

59:51.019 --> 59:52.188
Fuck!

59:55.891 --> 59:58.425
You can't call women
the fuckin' C-word.

59:58.427 --> 01:00:00.159
Yeah, well, she just broke
my heart, Nat.

01:00:00.161 --> 01:00:01.762
So I think "cunt" is
the appropriate word.

01:00:01.764 --> 01:00:03.329
I'm gonna go find my way
to LA.

01:00:03.331 --> 01:00:05.432
Oh, you're just pissed because
Rebecca wouldn't fuck you.

01:00:05.434 --> 01:00:07.367
Don't take it
out on me, bro.

01:00:07.369 --> 01:00:10.037
I'm the one who's brokenhearted here.
I'm the one that just got hurt.

01:00:10.039 --> 01:00:12.838
You don't think I see right
fucking through you?

01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:14.907
That you're fucking
using me?

01:00:14.909 --> 01:00:19.713
I'm paying for your hotel room,
your food, your fuckin' drinks,

01:00:19.715 --> 01:00:22.382
which, by the way, if you don't
know, you're a fucking alcoholic!

01:00:22.384 --> 01:00:24.316
Shut the fuck up, dude.
No, no, no, no, no.

01:00:24.318 --> 01:00:27.320
'Cause you're not paying
for jack shit, little rich boy.

01:00:27.322 --> 01:00:30.023
- Mommy and Daddy are paying for everything.
- Whatever!

01:00:30.025 --> 01:00:32.224
Have fun finding your way
to fuckin' Vegas,

01:00:32.226 --> 01:00:34.695
'cause you're not fuckin'
coming with me to LA.

01:00:34.697 --> 01:00:36.697
And you think I'm using you, dude?
No.

01:00:36.699 --> 01:00:39.199
You're fucking using me.
Okay, my image!

01:00:39.201 --> 01:00:42.101
Everything I fuckin' stand for,
for your bullshit fucking art.

01:00:42.103 --> 01:00:43.737
Fuck you.

01:00:43.739 --> 01:00:45.905
And what you don't even get
is that I have feelings, dude.

01:00:45.907 --> 01:00:48.141
I have feelings just like you.
Okay?

01:00:48.143 --> 01:00:50.844
But you don't even see that because
to you, I'm just some weird dude

01:00:50.846 --> 01:00:53.412
you're slumming it with on the
road, that you can fuckin' use

01:00:53.414 --> 01:00:56.048
for stories to get your fuckin'
dick sucked in art school.

01:00:56.050 --> 01:00:58.184
- Fuck you, dude.
- What the fuck are you talking about, Richard?

01:00:58.186 --> 01:01:00.287
Come on, man!

01:01:00.289 --> 01:01:01.987
You're fuckin' handsome.

01:01:01.989 --> 01:01:03.923
You're rich.

01:01:03.925 --> 01:01:07.059
You're on your way to becoming some
fuckin' big artist or whatever.

01:01:07.061 --> 01:01:10.162
And what am I? I'm just some
fuckin' poor, ugly piece of shit

01:01:10.164 --> 01:01:12.099
on his way
to an early grave.

01:01:12.101 --> 01:01:14.434
And here I was gonna
help you out of a jam

01:01:14.436 --> 01:01:16.836
so you wouldn't have to go running
back to Mommy and Daddy again.

01:01:16.838 --> 01:01:18.472
- Please, tell me how you were gonna help me.
- How?

01:01:18.474 --> 01:01:20.474
- I would love that.
- How? I happen to have a friend

01:01:20.476 --> 01:01:22.342
who lives not too far
from here named FranÃ§ois.

01:01:22.344 --> 01:01:25.244
I snap my fucking fingers
and he'll show up here,

01:01:25.246 --> 01:01:27.246
- and he'll do whatever it takes to get you to LA.
- Oh.

01:01:27.248 --> 01:01:30.050
Pretty soon, you'll be in art
school all safe and sound,

01:01:30.052 --> 01:01:32.318
- while I'll be on the road fuckin' dying in a ditch.
- Good luck with that.

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:34.521
I'm gonna take the bus.
Have fun.

01:01:34.523 --> 01:01:35.988
Joke's on you, asshole.

01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:37.326
There's no bus station
in this town.

01:01:45.134 --> 01:01:46.068
Fuck!

01:01:47.135 --> 01:01:48.467
Fine!

01:01:48.469 --> 01:01:50.936
Call Francis or whatever
the fuck his name is.

01:01:50.938 --> 01:01:52.171
His name's FranÃ§ois.

01:01:52.173 --> 01:01:53.539
I don't give a fuck.

01:01:53.541 --> 01:01:56.275
Okay, cool, I just...
I need your phone.

01:01:56.277 --> 01:01:57.376
What?

01:01:57.378 --> 01:01:58.945
I need your phone
to make the call.

01:01:58.947 --> 01:02:00.750
I don't have a phone.

01:02:11.393 --> 01:02:12.961
What's your code?

01:02:14.195 --> 01:02:15.961
Couple things
about FranÃ§ois.

01:02:15.963 --> 01:02:18.231
- What?
- One,

01:02:18.233 --> 01:02:21.001
don't call him
Francis or Frank

01:02:21.003 --> 01:02:22.401
or any shit
like that, okay?

01:02:22.403 --> 01:02:24.204
He doesn't like it.

01:02:24.206 --> 01:02:26.072
Number two,

01:02:26.074 --> 01:02:29.441
guy thinks he's some sort of fuckin'
hard-core badass or whatever.

01:02:29.443 --> 01:02:30.577
He's not.

01:02:30.579 --> 01:02:32.144
He's a fuckin' pussy,

01:02:32.146 --> 01:02:34.246
so don't listen to anything
he says, okay?

01:02:34.248 --> 01:02:36.416
Sounds just
like you.

01:02:36.418 --> 01:02:39.019
You know, you're becoming
a real fuckin' asshole.

01:02:39.021 --> 01:02:40.490
Well, I'm learning
from the best.

01:02:43.891 --> 01:02:45.458
- Minivan?
- Yep.

01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:47.526
All right.

01:02:47.528 --> 01:02:52.068
So, just as soon
as I have you sign here...

01:02:53.501 --> 01:02:56.869
And here.
Yep.

01:02:56.871 --> 01:02:59.442
I can go ahead and take that
car off your hands for ya.

01:03:01.543 --> 01:03:03.112
All right.

01:03:05.246 --> 01:03:06.412
All right.

01:03:06.414 --> 01:03:08.416
Pleasure doing business
with ya.

01:03:19.228 --> 01:03:21.327
Really need all that?

01:03:21.329 --> 01:03:23.162
I mean, I can't just
leave it all.

01:03:23.164 --> 01:03:24.331
Right?

01:03:24.333 --> 01:03:25.835
Whatever, man.

01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:33.409
Is that him?

01:03:34.376 --> 01:03:35.278
What the hell?

01:03:38.614 --> 01:03:42.182
Oh, I guess some things
just never change, huh?

01:03:42.184 --> 01:03:43.650
FranÃ§ois?

01:03:43.652 --> 01:03:45.320
It's good to see ya, man.

01:03:47.456 --> 01:03:49.858
- What are you wearing?
- Clothes.

01:03:50.525 --> 01:03:52.092
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:03:52.094 --> 01:03:53.360
- You must be Nat.
- Yes.

01:03:53.362 --> 01:03:54.494
Yeah.

01:03:54.496 --> 01:03:56.362
Heard a lot of
great stuff about you.

01:03:56.364 --> 01:03:58.298
Oh.
Good things, I hope.

01:03:58.300 --> 01:03:59.900
- Good things, yeah.
- Great.

01:03:59.902 --> 01:04:01.601
Um, by the way, thank you
so much for doing this.

01:04:01.603 --> 01:04:04.336
No, problemo.
<i>De nada.</i>

01:04:04.338 --> 01:04:07.039
- That's a nice camera. What is that?
- Uh, Pentax K1000.

01:04:07.041 --> 01:04:08.474
- K1000?
- Yeah.

01:04:08.476 --> 01:04:10.943
- Where'd you get that?
- Oh, my grandfather gave it to me.

01:04:10.945 --> 01:04:12.646
Whoa!
What the fuck, dude?

01:04:12.648 --> 01:04:14.481
Yeah. That's Jacqueline.
Watch your mouth, brother.

01:04:14.483 --> 01:04:17.416
Yeah, miracle of life.

01:04:17.418 --> 01:04:19.418
Pretty cool, right? Let's
get the party started here.

01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:21.121
Get your shit in the back.

01:04:21.123 --> 01:04:23.356
Since when do you
drive a Prius?

01:04:23.358 --> 01:04:25.691
Since the Earth
began to die.

01:04:25.693 --> 01:04:28.994
What happened to the GTO, man?

01:04:28.996 --> 01:04:31.466
I get 45 miles per
gallon in the city in this thing.

01:04:37.472 --> 01:04:39.104
Buckle up, dude.

01:04:39.106 --> 01:04:40.673
What?

01:04:40.675 --> 01:04:42.378
There's a kid
in the car.

01:05:01.963 --> 01:05:04.967
So Richard, uh, you've
been unusually quiet.

01:05:07.402 --> 01:05:09.105
What the fuck
happened to you, man?

01:05:10.739 --> 01:05:13.106
This guy basically taught me
everything I know.

01:05:13.108 --> 01:05:16.108
Literally, I wouldn't even be able to wipe
my own ass if it wasn't for this guy.

01:05:16.110 --> 01:05:18.311
You don't know how to wipe
your own ass, you dumb shit.

01:05:18.313 --> 01:05:20.313
Well, that is
kind of true.

01:05:20.315 --> 01:05:22.315
But seriously,
what happened?

01:05:22.317 --> 01:05:25.117
Hey, life goes on.
People change, man.

01:05:25.119 --> 01:05:27.022
You're looking at
the new me.

01:05:33.628 --> 01:05:35.427
Hey, Nat, will
you hand me my backpack?

01:05:35.429 --> 01:05:36.965
Uh, yeah, sure.

01:05:50.344 --> 01:05:52.211
What the fu... Hey,
have you seen my knife?

01:05:52.213 --> 01:05:54.179
Your knife?

01:05:54.181 --> 01:05:56.182
Yeah, my knife.

01:05:56.184 --> 01:05:57.650
My fuckin' dad
gave me that knife.

01:05:57.652 --> 01:06:00.119
It's the only thing I have from him.
It's not here.

01:06:00.121 --> 01:06:03.023
Um, no. No, no, no, no. I
haven't seen your knife.

01:06:03.025 --> 01:06:04.293
Your knife, no.

01:06:06.061 --> 01:06:07.193
That's weird.

01:06:07.195 --> 01:06:09.496
Yeah, weird.

01:06:09.498 --> 01:06:12.434
When's the last time
you were in Albuquerque, Richard?

01:06:13.702 --> 01:06:16.168
You're too good for us now.

01:06:16.170 --> 01:06:19.139
More like, Albuquerque's
too good for me.

01:06:19.141 --> 01:06:23.342
Hey man, again, I just wanna
say thank you so much for this.

01:06:23.344 --> 01:06:25.077
I really,
really appreciate it.

01:06:25.079 --> 01:06:27.146
Yeah. Hey, it's Richard
we're talking about, right?

01:06:27.148 --> 01:06:29.351
I can't tell you how many times
this guy's gotten me out of a jam.

01:06:31.452 --> 01:06:32.554
Uh...

01:06:34.389 --> 01:06:38.057
the sign says
straight for Albuquerque.

01:06:38.059 --> 01:06:40.827
- Huh?
- The sign back there, it said straight for Albuquerque.

01:06:40.829 --> 01:06:42.131
No.

01:06:43.532 --> 01:06:45.130
We're, uh,
taking a shortcut.

01:06:45.132 --> 01:06:46.532
We're gonna go around
the traffic.

01:06:46.534 --> 01:06:47.769
Oh. Okay.

01:06:51.773 --> 01:06:53.572
Everybody's got Chlamydia.

01:06:53.574 --> 01:06:56.242
- Fuckin' everybody's got Chlamydia.
- Yeah.

01:06:56.244 --> 01:06:58.244
I'm talking to FranÃ§ois
about it, and he goes...

01:06:58.246 --> 01:07:00.280
- Dude, I can't believe you're bringing this up.
- "My bad."

01:07:00.282 --> 01:07:02.115
- You remember that?
- Yeah. I do, I do.

01:07:02.117 --> 01:07:03.816
'Cause he was the one
who had it.

01:07:03.818 --> 01:07:06.119
He gave everybody
the same Chlamydia.

01:07:06.121 --> 01:07:08.354
Anybody else need to piss?

01:07:08.356 --> 01:07:10.690
Oh, man, we had some good
fuckin' times together, man.

01:07:10.692 --> 01:07:13.092
- Oh, shit, we sure did.
- Oh, shit.

01:07:13.094 --> 01:07:15.360
- Get out of the car.
- Holy shit. What are you doing?

01:07:15.362 --> 01:07:17.563
- Oh, fuck.
- Get out of the car. Get the fuck out of the car.

01:07:17.565 --> 01:07:20.333
- Go stand over there.
- Fuck me.

01:07:20.335 --> 01:07:22.534
How did I not
see this coming?

01:07:22.536 --> 01:07:24.539
You, give me your shit.

01:07:25.639 --> 01:07:27.574
- What?
- Your shit.

01:07:27.576 --> 01:07:29.842
I want your wallet, I want your phone,
and I want that sweet-ass camera.

01:07:29.844 --> 01:07:32.144
Put it on the seat
right now.

01:07:32.146 --> 01:07:34.179
Hey, <i>Ã¡ndale.</i>
Let's go.

01:07:34.181 --> 01:07:35.384
Come on.

01:07:37.885 --> 01:07:40.353
If you want my shit, you're
gonna have to come get it.

01:07:40.355 --> 01:07:42.322
What shit do you have?
You don't have any shit.

01:07:42.324 --> 01:07:43.822
That's not how friends
treat each other.

01:07:43.824 --> 01:07:46.258
I just told that great story
about how you gave me Chlamydia.

01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:47.726
That doesn't
make us friends.

01:07:47.728 --> 01:07:49.695
The only reason I'm here is
'cause you said

01:07:49.697 --> 01:07:52.164
you're with a little rich kid
with a wad of cash.

01:07:52.166 --> 01:07:54.733
Now look, you're not gonna say
anything about this to anybody

01:07:54.735 --> 01:08:00.173
because if you do, I'm gonna take a
little fuckin' visit to Enfield Lane,

01:08:00.175 --> 01:08:02.876
and I'm gonna curb-stomp
your fuckin' mom and dad.

01:08:02.878 --> 01:08:04.878
Shh. I know, honey.

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:06.746
It's okay.

01:08:06.748 --> 01:08:09.249
I will kick your mother
the fuck over, dude.

01:08:09.251 --> 01:08:10.816
Is that what you want?

01:08:10.818 --> 01:08:13.418
So you go ahead,
you call the cops.

01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:15.190
I'll take it out in pain.

01:08:16.791 --> 01:08:18.225
Adios, motherfuckers.

01:08:37.944 --> 01:08:39.879
I am so sorry.

01:08:39.881 --> 01:08:41.850
- If I had any...
- I'm done.

01:08:48.823 --> 01:08:50.326
Hang on, Nat.

01:08:52.627 --> 01:08:57.166
This is my fault, like,
almost all of it.

01:08:59.201 --> 01:09:00.469
Where are you going?

01:09:02.304 --> 01:09:03.506
Nat, hang on.

01:09:07.375 --> 01:09:10.345
Yeah, that's right. You-You
lead the way, I'll follow you.

01:09:13.648 --> 01:09:16.348
Nat, I fucked up.

01:09:16.350 --> 01:09:17.683
Shut up, Richard.

01:09:17.685 --> 01:09:19.885
Okay. Good. You're
talking to me again?

01:09:19.886 --> 01:09:22.688
Oh, thank God. This has been the
longest three hours of my life.

01:09:22.689 --> 01:09:24.691
- Oh, my God.
- You know, if I had my knife,

01:09:24.693 --> 01:09:26.526
I totally could've stabbed
that asshole.

01:09:26.528 --> 01:09:28.493
I threw your knife
out the window!

01:09:28.496 --> 01:09:29.728
- What?
- Yeah.

01:09:29.729 --> 01:09:32.799
So fuck you
and fuck your knife.

01:09:32.801 --> 01:09:34.334
Oh. Well,
I guess we're even, now.

01:09:34.336 --> 01:09:35.835
- Richard.
- Huh?

01:09:35.837 --> 01:09:37.402
- Shut up.
- Oh.

01:09:37.404 --> 01:09:38.870
Okay. Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:09:38.872 --> 01:09:41.340
You got it.

01:09:52.587 --> 01:09:55.888
I think I figured
the whole Nina thing out.

01:09:55.890 --> 01:09:58.657
I think the mistake I made
was I-I came on too strong.

01:09:58.659 --> 01:10:02.394
I just...
I fall in love too quick.

01:10:02.396 --> 01:10:04.500
You know, that's like...
that's my cross to bear.

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:13.606
Hey.

01:10:13.608 --> 01:10:15.508
Hey, little guy.

01:10:15.510 --> 01:10:17.376
You still mad at me?

01:10:17.378 --> 01:10:18.413
Shut up.

01:10:21.716 --> 01:10:23.816
You hear that?

01:10:23.818 --> 01:10:24.820
Hey!

01:10:26.421 --> 01:10:27.954
Hey, hey!

01:10:27.956 --> 01:10:29.557
Hey!

01:10:31.659 --> 01:10:32.827
Huh.

01:10:40.635 --> 01:10:42.701
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:10:42.703 --> 01:10:44.670
Thank you so much
for stopping.

01:10:44.672 --> 01:10:46.973
What the heck
are you doing out here?

01:10:46.975 --> 01:10:48.641
Uh, it's a long story.

01:10:48.643 --> 01:10:50.610
Uh, do you mind
giving us a lift?

01:10:50.612 --> 01:10:53.012
Well, I'm going as far as Silver City.
You wanna go there?

01:10:53.014 --> 01:10:54.880
Uh, yeah, that'd be great.
Please.

01:10:54.882 --> 01:10:56.715
Okay, guys. Hop on in. Come on.

01:10:56.717 --> 01:10:58.487
Okay. Great.
Thank you.

01:11:01.488 --> 01:11:03.889
Here we go.

01:11:03.891 --> 01:11:06.759
I've been up in Gila
for the last few days.

01:11:06.761 --> 01:11:08.760
I volunteer
with the Park Service.

01:11:08.762 --> 01:11:10.562
- Cool.
- Yeah, cool.

01:11:10.564 --> 01:11:12.031
- It is cool.
- It's cold. It's freezing.

01:11:12.033 --> 01:11:13.766
Here, take this sweatshirt.

01:11:13.768 --> 01:11:15.000
- Here, put it on.
- Are you sure?

01:11:15.002 --> 01:11:16.568
Yeah, sure I'm sure.

01:11:16.570 --> 01:11:17.872
Thank you.

01:11:19.541 --> 01:11:20.807
What's going on
with you guys?

01:11:20.809 --> 01:11:23.543
What're you doing out
on the road like that?

01:11:23.545 --> 01:11:26.379
- Uh, we just got robbed and were stranded up here.
- What?

01:11:26.381 --> 01:11:28.513
- What, you got robbed?
- Yeah.

01:11:28.515 --> 01:11:31.416
- Oh, my God.
- Friend of mine, who was supposed to be giving us a ride...

01:11:31.418 --> 01:11:32.884
- A friend!
- Well.

01:11:32.886 --> 01:11:35.955
Some friend.

01:11:35.957 --> 01:11:38.691
- Yeah.
- Jesus Christ.

01:11:38.693 --> 01:11:40.660
Well, you're
lucky it's January.

01:11:40.662 --> 01:11:43.562
It could've been worse.
The bears are all napping.

01:11:43.564 --> 01:11:46.866
God, I remember three
summers ago I was out here,

01:11:46.868 --> 01:11:49.369
was on an expedition
with a bunch of botanists.

01:11:49.371 --> 01:11:53.138
They were out collecting a bunch
of samples out in the field

01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:54.874
and I was back at camp.

01:11:54.876 --> 01:11:56.776
And I thought
I'd make some...

01:11:56.778 --> 01:11:58.910
some vegetable soup
for everybody.

01:11:58.912 --> 01:12:03.116
So I was peeling potatoes
and I hear this...

01:12:07.756 --> 01:12:10.156
What's that?

01:12:10.158 --> 01:12:12.558
Yeah, that's what I thought.
"What's that?"

01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:14.861
And I look up,

01:12:14.863 --> 01:12:17.796
and there's
a little cub.

01:12:17.798 --> 01:12:20.098
And there's another
little cub.

01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:22.802
And behind the two
cubs is Mommy.

01:12:22.804 --> 01:12:23.870
- Oh.
- Oh, my God.

01:12:23.872 --> 01:12:26.805
Yeah. And she was
not happy.

01:12:26.807 --> 01:12:29.875
And she was not asking me for soup.

01:12:29.877 --> 01:12:32.544
And I remembered, you know,
you're supposed to, like,

01:12:32.546 --> 01:12:34.781
get real full of
yourself, you know?

01:12:34.783 --> 01:12:38.084
You're supposed to, like, you know,
be big, try to be as big as they are.

01:12:38.086 --> 01:12:40.585
Well I'm 5'4", you know.
So that's not gonna happen.

01:12:40.587 --> 01:12:45.157
But I just got so full of
adrenaline and fear

01:12:45.159 --> 01:12:47.759
that I just
started yelling at her.

01:12:47.761 --> 01:12:51.964
And I said, "Get the fuck out of
my campground, you crazy bitch!"

01:12:51.966 --> 01:12:56.501
And... And I started
throwing my potatoes at her.

01:12:56.503 --> 01:12:58.603
And I startled her.
She just...

01:12:58.605 --> 01:13:01.040
I didn't know what was gonna
happen, and all of a sudden...

01:13:01.042 --> 01:13:03.108
Oh, thank you Jesus...
she ran!

01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:05.710
She ran.
Her cubs ran.

01:13:05.712 --> 01:13:08.848
And I just kept throwing. I was just
picking up carrots and potatoes

01:13:08.850 --> 01:13:11.217
and everything,
and I just went crazy.

01:13:11.219 --> 01:13:14.553
And... And then
they were gone.

01:13:14.555 --> 01:13:16.455
- And...
- That's amazing.

01:13:16.457 --> 01:13:17.924
And it was...

01:13:17.926 --> 01:13:19.759
It was such a great
feeling, you know?

01:13:19.761 --> 01:13:22.160
It was like... It was like...
It was like, you know...

01:13:22.162 --> 01:13:24.897
Those times when you just feel
like a penny waiting for a change

01:13:24.899 --> 01:13:27.599
and then all of a sudden,
the cash box is full.

01:13:27.601 --> 01:13:30.469
Yeah.
It was all right.

01:13:30.471 --> 01:13:34.005
You know, those botanists came
back and I-I told them that story.

01:13:35.777 --> 01:13:38.643
Well, somebody else was Big
Man On Campus that night.

01:13:38.645 --> 01:13:41.947
I can tell you that. That was the truth, yeah.

01:13:41.949 --> 01:13:44.884
- Yeah.
- Somewhere that bear's telling the story

01:13:44.886 --> 01:13:49.625
- about the crazy lady with vegetables.
- Yeah.

01:14:16.251 --> 01:14:17.817
Hey, Nat?

01:14:17.819 --> 01:14:19.986
Nat.
Wake up, buddy.

01:14:19.988 --> 01:14:21.620
Okay.

01:14:21.622 --> 01:14:25.892
I think you should report
what happened to the police.

01:14:25.894 --> 01:14:28.027
- Um...
- Okay?

01:14:28.029 --> 01:14:29.661
- Thank you. Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:14:29.663 --> 01:14:31.731
- Um, thank you very much.
- You bet.

01:14:31.733 --> 01:14:33.566
- For everything. Really.
- You bet. No problem.

01:14:33.568 --> 01:14:35.735
Hey.
Hold on a second.

01:14:35.737 --> 01:14:37.239
Hold on a second.

01:14:44.712 --> 01:14:46.711
You guys need this
more than I do.

01:14:48.949 --> 01:14:50.950
- Thank you.
- Sure.

01:14:50.952 --> 01:14:52.684
- Really, thank you.
- It's okay. Yeah.

01:14:52.686 --> 01:14:55.888
You just... You go on in there
and just tell 'em everything,

01:14:55.890 --> 01:14:57.255
and they'll
take care of ya.

01:14:57.257 --> 01:14:58.991
I've known these guys
for years. They're great.

01:14:58.993 --> 01:15:00.293
- Okay, cool. Thank you.
- Okay.

01:15:00.295 --> 01:15:02.894
Hey, Richard? Good
luck to ya, buddy.

01:15:02.896 --> 01:15:04.099
Thanks for everything,
Dotty.

01:15:15.042 --> 01:15:18.145
Well...
I guess this is it.

01:15:24.786 --> 01:15:27.786
I don't know about you,
but I'm starving.

01:15:27.788 --> 01:15:29.023
Wait. What?

01:15:35.829 --> 01:15:39.100
This is seriously, like,
the best food I've ever eaten.

01:15:40.268 --> 01:15:42.034
You've changed, man.

01:15:42.036 --> 01:15:44.336
You're no longer like the baby Nat
that I met a couple days ago.

01:15:44.338 --> 01:15:47.272
You're like,
real hard-core now.

01:15:47.274 --> 01:15:50.875
- Being held at gunpoint will do that to you.
- It's true.

01:15:50.877 --> 01:15:53.278
Hey, so when you
go to the cops,

01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:54.813
probably gonna
hang out here.

01:15:54.815 --> 01:15:56.781
Me and the police, we don't
really mix very well.

01:15:56.783 --> 01:16:00.288
I'm not going to the station.
Hitching a ride to Albuquerque.

01:16:01.689 --> 01:16:03.222
To Albuquerque?

01:16:03.224 --> 01:16:04.857
FranÃ§ois.

01:16:04.859 --> 01:16:07.293
- You ready to see how it's done?
- By all means, please.

01:16:07.295 --> 01:16:09.160
- You ready to see the master in action?
- I would love to.

01:16:09.162 --> 01:16:10.862
Show me how it's done please, bud.

01:16:10.864 --> 01:16:12.031
Here we go.

01:16:12.033 --> 01:16:14.333
We're about to go
to Albuquerque.

01:16:14.335 --> 01:16:16.768
Ten bucks says
I get the first car.

01:16:16.770 --> 01:16:18.103
- You guys need a ride?
- Yeah.

01:16:18.105 --> 01:16:20.071
- Yeah, we would love one.
- Yeah, come on. Why?

01:16:20.073 --> 01:16:21.906
Yeah, are you
going to Albuquerque?

01:16:21.908 --> 01:16:23.742
Real sorry, dude. She's freakin' out.
I don't know.

01:16:23.744 --> 01:16:25.777
Fuck you!

01:16:25.779 --> 01:16:27.146
That was weird.

01:16:27.148 --> 01:16:29.382
Fuck, man.

01:16:29.384 --> 01:16:31.349
Ah, actually that
happens to me all the time.

01:16:31.351 --> 01:16:33.352
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:16:33.354 --> 01:16:35.987
You get out here and try it. Maybe your
pretty face will change the equation.

01:16:35.989 --> 01:16:37.956
Sure. Should I...
So it's blowin' on the thumb?

01:16:37.958 --> 01:16:40.826
- Oh, just get out there, you little shit.
- That's... Just blow on it?

01:16:40.828 --> 01:16:41.960
- Yeah.
- Like that?

01:16:41.962 --> 01:16:43.294
- Shut up.
- Do I shake it?

01:16:43.296 --> 01:16:45.296
- Do I go rad?
- You know what? Don't get cocky, okay?

01:16:45.298 --> 01:16:47.700
Oh.
Hey, hey, hey.

01:16:47.702 --> 01:16:48.867
- I think I got one.
- What?

01:16:48.869 --> 01:16:50.402
- No!
- Yes!

01:16:50.404 --> 01:16:53.272
Are you kidding?

01:16:53.274 --> 01:16:54.973
- Amazing!
- That's not how it works.

01:16:54.975 --> 01:16:56.776
I want you to know that.

01:16:56.778 --> 01:16:59.144
- You just got lucky. That's beginner's luck.
- No.

01:16:59.146 --> 01:17:01.046
Hi. Uh, we're headed
towards Albuquerque.

01:17:01.048 --> 01:17:03.081
- Do you mind if you take us?
- Get in the back.

01:17:03.083 --> 01:17:05.386
- Get in the back.
- I got the car.

01:17:11.359 --> 01:17:12.761
Right up here is fine.

01:17:16.264 --> 01:17:18.763
- Thank you so much, Gary.
- All right, man.

01:17:18.765 --> 01:17:21.702
- Good luck with getting your kids back.
- Thank you very much.

01:17:23.970 --> 01:17:25.204
Okay, listen.

01:17:25.206 --> 01:17:27.106
I don't know what you think
you're doing, okay,

01:17:27.108 --> 01:17:30.742
but this isn't your exact world,
okay, crime and so forth.

01:17:30.744 --> 01:17:33.745
So you don't just go barging into some
guy's house who robbed you at gunpoint.

01:17:33.747 --> 01:17:34.946
- I think that's the car.
- Wait. No.

01:17:34.948 --> 01:17:36.482
It may be,
but it doesn't matter.

01:17:36.484 --> 01:17:38.217
Are you listening to me?

01:17:38.219 --> 01:17:40.052
You... Nat.

01:17:40.054 --> 01:17:41.887
- Nat!
- Shut up, Richard. Come on.

01:17:41.889 --> 01:17:44.889
- You can't sneak around in the middle of broad daylight.
- Shh!

01:17:44.891 --> 01:17:46.826
Walk like
a normal person.

01:17:46.828 --> 01:17:49.027
You look ridi...
Oh, my God.

01:17:49.029 --> 01:17:50.331
You're gonna
get us arrested.

01:17:57.171 --> 01:17:59.007
My wallet and stuff
are in the back.

01:18:00.807 --> 01:18:02.340
Shit.
It's locked.

01:18:02.342 --> 01:18:04.943
What are you doing?
No, no, no, no, no!

01:18:04.945 --> 01:18:07.448
Come back.
No, don't.

01:18:13.386 --> 01:18:15.053
- God! Fuck!
- Shh!

01:18:15.055 --> 01:18:17.889
Goddamn it. That cactus got
me right in the fuckin' dick.

01:18:17.891 --> 01:18:20.259
- His keys are right by the front door.
- God. Fuck.

01:18:20.261 --> 01:18:22.827
God.

01:18:22.829 --> 01:18:25.097
- Door's locked.
- Okay. Well, we tried. Let's go.

01:18:25.099 --> 01:18:26.397
Yeah. Let's go
through the back.

01:18:26.399 --> 01:18:28.400
No. We're not
going through the back.

01:18:28.402 --> 01:18:30.535
You don't go in the back door
of someone's house

01:18:30.537 --> 01:18:34.874
who you know has a gun,
and is also inside the house.

01:18:34.876 --> 01:18:38.843
You are doing this wrong. It's not like
the back door is gonna be open anyway.

01:18:38.845 --> 01:18:39.747
Oh, goddamn it!

01:19:15.949 --> 01:19:19.951
<i>When Turner gives
the order, cease fire.</i>

01:19:19.953 --> 01:19:21.853
I'm gonna get his keys.
Cover me. Okay?

01:19:21.855 --> 01:19:23.125
Okay.

01:19:25.025 --> 01:19:26.525
<i>You wait for a sign.</i>

01:19:50.318 --> 01:19:52.154
Go.

01:19:59.393 --> 01:20:01.863
Mommy.

01:20:26.020 --> 01:20:27.620
- Hang on.
- What?

01:20:27.622 --> 01:20:29.925
I'm gonna take a shit
on this guy's front step.

01:20:31.559 --> 01:20:33.295
No one fucks
with my friends.

01:20:35.095 --> 01:20:37.095
Hurry up.

01:20:37.097 --> 01:20:38.930
- Richard.
- Oh!

01:20:38.932 --> 01:20:40.299
Taking a shit
on my steps?

01:20:40.301 --> 01:20:42.367
Monica, get the gun.

01:20:42.369 --> 01:20:44.035
Oh, God.

01:20:44.037 --> 01:20:46.405
You little bitch-ass
piece of shit!

01:20:46.407 --> 01:20:48.907
- FranÃ§ois, I can't hear you.
- I said, get the gun!

01:20:48.909 --> 01:20:51.610
Don't yell. You'll wake up the ba...
Oh, you woke the baby.

01:20:51.612 --> 01:20:53.646
- So, feed her!
- Father of the Fuckin' Year.

01:20:53.648 --> 01:20:55.915
- Is that Richard?
- Hi, Monica.

01:20:55.917 --> 01:20:57.049
Cool, guys.
Awesome.

01:21:02.122 --> 01:21:03.923
You think you're so hard,
don't you?

01:21:03.925 --> 01:21:05.360
You don't know hard.

01:21:07.161 --> 01:21:08.693
You pussy little bitch.

01:21:08.695 --> 01:21:10.195
- Richard!
- Piece of shit.

01:21:10.197 --> 01:21:12.263
You don't know.

01:21:12.265 --> 01:21:14.532
You're a fuckin' joke,
Richard.

01:21:14.534 --> 01:21:17.204
You always have been.
And you always will be.

01:21:23.711 --> 01:21:24.977
Come on.

01:21:24.979 --> 01:21:26.344
I'll drive.

01:21:26.346 --> 01:21:27.545
- What?
- I'll drive!

01:21:27.547 --> 01:21:28.617
Okay.

01:21:35.055 --> 01:21:36.655
He's not getting up.

01:21:36.657 --> 01:21:38.123
- Hurry up!
- I'm hurrying.

01:21:38.125 --> 01:21:40.095
It's a fuckin' Prius,
dickhead.

01:21:41.729 --> 01:21:45.664
Thank you, man. Thank you for
helping me out. That was huge.

01:21:45.666 --> 01:21:48.267
- Do you think I hurt him?
- Fuck, yeah, you hurt him. Are you kidding?

01:21:48.269 --> 01:21:50.001
- You probably fuckin' killed him.
- What?

01:21:50.003 --> 01:21:52.036
I'm kidding with you.
Dude, I'm fucking with you.

01:21:52.038 --> 01:21:53.705
- You definitely did not kill him.
- Okay.

01:21:53.707 --> 01:21:55.708
At best, he's gonna need
some stitches, okay.

01:21:55.710 --> 01:21:59.311
Which he fucking deserves
for coming at us like that.

01:21:59.313 --> 01:22:02.180
Whoo! Classic FranÃ§ois, though.

01:22:02.182 --> 01:22:05.183
I'm glad to know
he's still in the game.

01:22:05.185 --> 01:22:07.186
Geez.

01:22:07.188 --> 01:22:08.519
Look good?

01:22:08.521 --> 01:22:09.754
- It's great.
- Okay, good.

01:22:09.756 --> 01:22:11.322
- It's good, it's good.
- All right.

01:22:11.324 --> 01:22:13.525
- Oh.
- Fuck, yeah. We did it, man.

01:22:13.527 --> 01:22:15.527
- We fuckin' did it.
- Oh, my God, your head's bleeding.

01:22:15.529 --> 01:22:17.196
- Are you okay?
- What?

01:22:17.198 --> 01:22:19.197
Oh, look at that.
Yeah.

01:22:19.199 --> 01:22:21.767
Oh, he fuckin' got me.

01:22:21.769 --> 01:22:24.268
You know what though?
I got to respect it.

01:22:24.270 --> 01:22:26.304
He had to come at me.

01:22:26.306 --> 01:22:27.638
Makes sense.

01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:30.342
I mean, it's crazy.

01:22:30.344 --> 01:22:32.678
- It's crazy.
- Nah. You know, it's not crazy.

01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:35.546
- It's FranÃ§ois.
- I hit him.

01:22:35.548 --> 01:22:37.516
Dude, did you see when I did it?
I hit him...

01:22:37.518 --> 01:22:40.119
- Oh, yeah. It was fuckin' badass, dude.
- Oh, my God. That's amazing.

01:22:40.121 --> 01:22:42.588
- I've never done anything like that before in my life.
- That was fuckin' badass moves.

01:22:42.590 --> 01:22:44.059
- I love that.
- Jesus Christ.

01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:54.532
- What's happening?
- What's happening is you're getting out.

01:22:54.534 --> 01:22:56.070
- Let's go.
- What?

01:22:57.304 --> 01:22:59.037
Okay. Come on.

01:22:59.039 --> 01:23:00.438
We're driving a stolen car.

01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:02.808
You just assaulted somebody.
We gotta get you outta here.

01:23:02.810 --> 01:23:04.543
What about you?

01:23:04.545 --> 01:23:06.178
What about me?
Who cares?

01:23:06.180 --> 01:23:07.649
Just take your stuff and go.

01:23:15.555 --> 01:23:17.522
That's it?
That's all you're taking?

01:23:17.524 --> 01:23:20.358
Yeah. All this shit
doesn't seem important anymore.

01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:22.727
You're welcome to keep whatever you
want and throw away whatever you don't.

01:23:22.729 --> 01:23:24.498
All right.
Whatever.

01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:29.668
This is our third time
saying good-bye.

01:23:29.670 --> 01:23:32.106
Yeah, well, you know what they say.
Third time's a charm, right?

01:23:36.510 --> 01:23:38.146
All right.
Oh, okay.

01:23:40.448 --> 01:23:41.750
You take care of yourself, Nat.
Okay?

01:23:43.417 --> 01:23:44.750
You too, Richard.

01:23:44.752 --> 01:23:46.285
You're a good kid.

01:23:46.287 --> 01:23:48.219
Thanks, man.

01:23:48.221 --> 01:23:49.620
Keep that dick dry.

01:23:49.622 --> 01:23:51.156
Yep.

01:23:51.158 --> 01:23:52.694
You too, bud.

01:23:59.833 --> 01:24:01.866
Hey, Nat.

01:24:01.868 --> 01:24:03.535
Eat shit.
