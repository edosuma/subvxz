WEBVTT

00:28.396 --> 00:30.164
(camera shutter clicking)
MAN (whispering): Hey.

00:30.198 --> 00:31.365
No flash.

00:31.399 --> 00:33.201
Sorry.

00:37.238 --> 00:39.573
MAN:
This is it.

00:39.607 --> 00:41.709
Locals have seen the lights
twice from here,

00:41.742 --> 00:42.843
including last night.

00:42.876 --> 00:46.114
WOMAN: Reports on ConspiracyNet
say Goathart is housing

00:46.147 --> 00:46.814
a reverse-UFO technology
project.

00:46.847 --> 00:49.117
MAN: Yeah,

00:49.150 --> 00:51.352
I've also heard
it's a reinvent of a Nazi

00:51.385 --> 00:53.321
superweapons program.

00:53.354 --> 00:55.589
Others think it's ghosts--

00:55.623 --> 00:58.526
spirits of World War II
test pilots.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.494
Whatever's going on,

01:00.528 --> 01:03.431
this is where it's happening.

01:03.464 --> 01:06.534
Welcome to the new Dreamland.

01:07.668 --> 01:10.538
The new Area 51.

01:34.295 --> 01:35.896
4:20.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.798
Only two more hours
till sunrise.

01:37.831 --> 01:41.335
Prime time for covert
military activity.

01:41.369 --> 01:42.670
WOMAN:
I'm going to need more coffee.

01:42.703 --> 01:45.639
(low, distant humming)

01:45.673 --> 01:47.575
WOMAN (whispering):
You hear that?

01:47.608 --> 01:48.709
MAN:
Hear what?

01:48.742 --> 01:50.778
(low humming continues)

01:52.680 --> 01:54.348
(whirring)

01:54.382 --> 01:55.549
(crackling and crashing)

01:56.417 --> 01:58.419
That.

01:58.452 --> 02:02.256
(crackling and crashing
continue)

02:02.290 --> 02:03.524
Mother Mary of...

02:08.862 --> 02:09.830
(whispering):
Look!

02:11.332 --> 02:12.900
(panting)

02:18.872 --> 02:21.175
(crackling, woman screams)

02:24.478 --> 02:28.916
(low, harmonic tones resonate)

02:44.365 --> 02:45.966
Hey, buddy.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.368
Death by UFO?

02:47.401 --> 02:49.337
Should be interesting.

02:49.370 --> 02:50.871
Yeah, we're hoping for a more
terrestrial explanation.

02:50.904 --> 02:53.207
Uh, victim here
was badly burned, so it's going

02:53.241 --> 02:54.141
to be a while
before we can identify.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.810
What have we got here,
some targets, huh?

02:56.844 --> 02:59.413
DAVID: Yeah. Thought this base
was shut down a long time ago.

02:59.447 --> 03:01.249
Well, Goathart Air Base

03:01.282 --> 03:04.285
was officially decommissioned
in 1986.

03:04.318 --> 03:06.320
It was established in 1938

03:06.354 --> 03:07.621
as a proving ground
for new aircraft.

03:07.655 --> 03:09.623
Taking its name
from the local Goathart

03:09.657 --> 03:11.292
mountain range.

03:11.325 --> 03:12.993
It's really just a monogenetic
volcanic field

03:13.026 --> 03:15.296
created about seven and a half
million years ago.

03:15.329 --> 03:17.798
Well, 7.6. Let's be fair.

03:17.831 --> 03:19.300
Right, and-and you are?

03:19.333 --> 03:20.434
Oh, I'm sorry. Of course.

03:20.468 --> 03:21.935
I'm, uh, Floyd Mayborne.

03:21.969 --> 03:23.437
I'm from Department 44.

03:23.471 --> 03:24.372
Department 44?

03:24.405 --> 03:25.606
Pentagon.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.508
- You got some I.D. there?
- Oh,

03:27.541 --> 03:29.343
I'm afraid Department 44
personnel

03:29.377 --> 03:31.479
are not allowed
to carry identification.

03:31.512 --> 03:33.547
For reasons that cannot be
specified at this time.

03:33.581 --> 03:35.249
I can give you

03:35.283 --> 03:38.352
a number to call
for verification.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.989
What exactly is Department 44?

03:42.022 --> 03:43.991
Oh, I'm not allowed to describe

03:44.024 --> 03:46.560
or to share
our current responsibilities.

03:46.594 --> 03:48.796
For reasons that cannot be
specified at this time.

03:48.829 --> 03:51.499
I can tell you, however,
Department 44 was originally

03:51.532 --> 03:54.335
established in 1863--
during the Civil War--

03:54.368 --> 03:56.370
in response to widespread
profiteering

03:56.404 --> 03:58.372
of military property.

03:58.406 --> 04:01.742
The theft and black market sale
of rations,

04:01.775 --> 04:03.811
boots, cannon wheels,
that sort of thing.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.313
So, why are you here?

04:05.346 --> 04:08.416
Well, this incident involves
military property.

04:08.449 --> 04:09.817
I was hoping you'd be so kind

04:09.850 --> 04:12.353
as to allow me to monitor
the FBI investigation.

04:12.386 --> 04:14.422
We're going to have to get
back to you on that one.

04:14.455 --> 04:16.424
We're talking alien heat rays,

04:16.457 --> 04:17.758
or maybe ghosts.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.527
Souls of dead pilots.

04:19.560 --> 04:23.297
Sounds like there's no shortage
of irrational theories.

04:23.331 --> 04:25.599
Oh, in my line of work,
I often find it difficult

04:25.633 --> 04:27.935
to stay strictly within
the bounds of rationality.

04:27.968 --> 04:29.303
Yeah, I bet.

04:32.706 --> 04:35.376
NIKKI:
Your weird friend was right.

04:35.409 --> 04:37.678
The base was shuttered in 1986.

04:37.711 --> 04:39.780
There haven't been any military
operations authorized

04:39.813 --> 04:41.048
at the base the entire time.

04:41.081 --> 04:42.550
Who were all these people?

04:42.583 --> 04:44.452
UFO and paranormal buffs.

04:44.485 --> 04:45.919
They've been tracking
Internet reports

04:45.953 --> 04:47.355
about strange lights.

04:47.388 --> 04:49.390
They camp out
along the perimeter, hoping

04:49.423 --> 04:51.492
- to collect evidence.
- Of what?

04:51.525 --> 04:53.594
Secret government UFO
technology.

04:53.627 --> 04:54.962
NIKKI:
Nellis has to deal

04:54.995 --> 04:56.464
with these kinds
of people all the time.

04:56.497 --> 04:58.532
- Nellis?
- DAVID: Air Base. Area 51.

04:58.566 --> 05:00.601
Oh. So these are really
reliable people, right?

05:00.634 --> 05:02.436
Look, short of getting access

05:02.470 --> 05:04.838
to the X Files, we're not going
with any kind of alien death ray

05:04.872 --> 05:06.807
- theories, period.
- COLBY: Guys.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.409
Processed the photos
and the video

05:08.442 --> 05:10.411
from these witnesses
at Goathart.

05:10.444 --> 05:13.313
Nothing Pulitzer-prize-winning,
but we did get something.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.417
What the hell was that?
Let me see it again.

05:18.552 --> 05:20.053
You were saying, Agent Mulder?

05:29.597 --> 05:33.701
The Air Force has reverse-
engineered crashed UFOs.

05:33.734 --> 05:36.804
It's beyond imagination.

05:36.837 --> 05:39.540
That's why they call
places like Goathart

05:39.573 --> 05:42.776
and Area 51 "Dreamland."

05:42.810 --> 05:44.044
COLBY:
Okay, but why

05:44.077 --> 05:46.480
was your group out
at the air base last night?

05:46.514 --> 05:48.916
Locals been seeing strange
lights out there for a week.

05:48.949 --> 05:50.751
We'd been out twice before

05:50.784 --> 05:52.753
trying to get something
on camera.

05:52.786 --> 05:55.923
- Last night, we got lucky.
- NIKKI: Lucky?

05:55.956 --> 05:56.990
Someone was killed.

05:57.024 --> 06:00.027
I know. It's a... tragedy.

06:00.060 --> 06:02.029
But you got to understand.

06:02.062 --> 06:04.131
This is the first confirmed

06:04.164 --> 06:07.668
observation
of alien weapon technology.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.703
All right, how can you
be so sure

06:09.737 --> 06:11.672
that what you saw
wasn't a natural phenomenon?

06:11.705 --> 06:13.874
Good point.

06:13.907 --> 06:17.177
Could have been, uh,
spiritual energy.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.680
Angry ghosts of dead pilots.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.482
It would help
if you took these questions

06:21.515 --> 06:22.550
a little more seriously.

06:22.583 --> 06:26.887
Giant balls of energy
raining down from the sky?

06:26.920 --> 06:30.057
Does that seem natural to you?

06:32.693 --> 06:37.631
(whispering):
Everything you know is wrong.

06:44.738 --> 06:45.873
Oh, guys, wait. Here, excellent.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.608
I want you to meet
Floyd Mayborne.

06:47.641 --> 06:50.611
He's, uh, Department 44
of the Pentagon.

06:50.644 --> 06:53.614
Department 44?

06:53.647 --> 06:55.783
Yeah, DC requested
that, uh, Mr. Mayborne

06:55.816 --> 06:57.851
observe our investigation.

06:57.885 --> 07:02.690
Extraordinary high-pressure day
you're having here, hmm?

07:02.723 --> 07:03.924
Weather-wise.

07:03.957 --> 07:07.094
The buildup of air pressure
in the high-altitude Great Basin

07:07.127 --> 07:09.096
between the Sierra Nevada
and the Rocky Mountains,

07:09.129 --> 07:10.798
creating adiabatic winds

07:10.831 --> 07:12.633
which are propelled
gravitationally

07:12.666 --> 07:13.767
toward the Southern
California coastline.

07:13.801 --> 07:16.670
NIKKI:
I'm sorry, what?

07:16.704 --> 07:20.007
Hot, dry conditions otherwise
known as the Santa Anas.

07:20.040 --> 07:22.009
Sounds like he'd enjoy
talking to Charlie.

07:22.042 --> 07:24.177
- Ooh, yes, Professor Eppes.
- The one and only.

07:24.211 --> 07:25.679
I would enjoy that.

07:25.713 --> 07:27.681
I really like working
with numbers.

07:27.715 --> 07:28.849
Oh, yeah,
that's a good idea, Colby.

07:28.882 --> 07:31.719
Why don't you run him over
to, uh, Cal Sci, would you?

07:31.752 --> 07:33.153
Colby?

07:33.186 --> 07:34.622
That's my grandmother's name.

07:34.655 --> 07:36.657
- Come on.
- DAVID: Hey, Don.

07:36.690 --> 07:37.958
You got a second?

07:37.991 --> 07:40.694
- Yeah. What's up?
- Now that I'm at

07:40.728 --> 07:43.597
a supervisory level,
I... I'd love some advice

07:43.631 --> 07:45.499
on what assignments
to go after.

07:45.533 --> 07:48.001
You know, like, "Where do I go
from here?" kind of thing.

07:48.035 --> 07:51.038
You have two tracks:
fieldwork and management.

07:51.071 --> 07:52.740
Well, you've managed
to keep your feet

07:52.773 --> 07:54.107
- in both worlds, though.
- Yeah,

07:54.141 --> 07:56.109
but, I mean,
I never thought about it.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.111
You're saying you didn't know
what you wanted to do?

07:58.145 --> 08:00.047
Nah, look, I knew
I wanted to be active.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.582
I knew I wanted
to be doing things,

08:01.615 --> 08:02.650
not filing reports.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.052
And, you know, eventually,

08:05.085 --> 08:06.887
I-I knew I wanted
to run a team.

08:06.920 --> 08:09.723
Okay... why?

08:09.757 --> 08:11.592
(sighs)
Why?

08:11.625 --> 08:14.227
Well, look, you know
what they say, right?

08:14.261 --> 08:16.196
"Once you had a boss,
you want to be a boss."

08:16.229 --> 08:17.731
And-and, you know,
like yourself,

08:17.765 --> 08:19.166
you see enough things
done wrong around here--

08:19.199 --> 08:20.834
don't say anything.

08:20.868 --> 08:22.870
And then, they see
you can manage people,

08:22.903 --> 08:25.038
and you get yourself a desk.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.643
It's not like I...
I made a decision.

08:29.677 --> 08:32.680
I just... I kind of played
the hand I was dealt,

08:32.713 --> 08:34.682
then, I mean,
that's the way it worked.

08:34.715 --> 08:35.749
You know what I'm saying?

08:35.783 --> 08:36.817
Think so.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.786
I mean...

08:40.921 --> 08:42.923
I guess I didn't
really have a plan.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.858
How did that work out for you?

08:46.359 --> 08:49.262
I'm going to have to get back
to you on that one.

08:51.732 --> 08:53.701
RIDENHOUR:
We're pulling dental records,

08:53.734 --> 08:56.704
but so far,
no positive I.D. match.

08:56.737 --> 08:58.806
Can you tell us anything
about the victim?

08:58.839 --> 09:01.642
Female. Late 20s, early 30s.

09:01.675 --> 09:03.977
Likes take-out Chinese food.

09:04.011 --> 09:05.846
At least that was
her last meal.

09:05.879 --> 09:08.949
Bit of a weekend warrior,
tennis or softball,

09:08.982 --> 09:11.585
moderate tendon strains
in the knee and right elbow.

09:11.619 --> 09:13.754
- Cause of death?
- Coronary arrest.

09:13.787 --> 09:14.855
From what, I'm not sure.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.690
These massive burns
indicate contact

09:16.724 --> 09:18.091
with a serious energy source.

09:18.125 --> 09:19.793
The only time I've seen
something like this

09:19.827 --> 09:21.595
was with a lightning strike.

09:21.629 --> 09:22.796
There were no thunderstorms.

09:22.830 --> 09:25.833
Just a shower
of alien death rays.

09:25.866 --> 09:27.300
Yeah, that or killer ghosts.

09:27.334 --> 09:29.737
The only other thing
of note is this.

09:29.770 --> 09:32.806
I've indicated what looks
like the burn impression

09:32.840 --> 09:36.176
of a long necklace
or I.D. badge.

09:36.209 --> 09:37.377
Where is it?

09:37.410 --> 09:39.046
Could've just burned up.

09:40.781 --> 09:43.651
Or maybe someone took it
before the cops showed up.

09:48.188 --> 09:50.624
MAN:
High-density toroid?

09:50.658 --> 09:51.625
Otto Bahnhoff.

09:51.659 --> 09:53.827
Dr. Waldie said you were
looking for an engineer

09:53.861 --> 09:54.795
with experience in plasma
physics.

09:54.828 --> 09:55.863
Yes.

09:55.896 --> 09:57.898
Thank you for coming by
so quickly, Dr. Bahnhoff.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.032
Uh, please, Otto.

09:59.066 --> 10:01.034
- My friends call me Otto-Bahn.
- Oh.

10:01.068 --> 10:02.636
Ah, that's fascinating.

10:02.670 --> 10:03.971
Uh, where's this from?

10:04.004 --> 10:05.272
Uh, this is from the FBI.

10:05.305 --> 10:06.406
But, uh, Dr. Waldie said

10:06.439 --> 10:07.540
you have a security
clearance, right?

10:07.574 --> 10:09.777
Oh, yes, yes. I have two current
projects with Raytheon.

10:09.810 --> 10:10.744
Now, what are the dimensions?

10:10.778 --> 10:12.880
It's hard to judge the scale
on this video.

10:12.913 --> 10:13.881
You know, I don't have
the dimensions.

10:13.914 --> 10:16.684
I have to assume
that the objects are anywhere

10:16.717 --> 10:18.018
from one to three meters
in diameter.

10:18.051 --> 10:20.353
But, uh, Otto? Otto?

10:20.387 --> 10:21.822
Otto-Bahn?

10:21.855 --> 10:23.156
Listen, the important thing here

10:23.190 --> 10:24.825
is that one of these things
killed someone.

10:24.858 --> 10:26.159
Uh-huh. Do you know the source?

10:26.193 --> 10:28.128
- No.
- Oh, good, good-- a mystery.

10:28.161 --> 10:29.830
- Hello.
- Hello.

10:29.863 --> 10:31.264
Hi. Come in.

10:31.298 --> 10:33.033
CHARLIE: Floyd Mayborne
from the Pentagon.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.367
This is Dr. Otto Bahnhoff.

10:34.401 --> 10:36.003
He's Cal Sci's resident
plasma physics expert.

10:36.036 --> 10:37.004
Oh, the Pentagon.

10:37.037 --> 10:38.972
I'm sure we must know
some of the same people.

10:39.006 --> 10:41.374
Actually,
I'm quite sure we don't.

10:41.408 --> 10:43.410
Uh, have you considered
the possibility

10:43.443 --> 10:45.012
that this was ball lightning?

10:45.045 --> 10:47.848
Uh, ball lightning
was never definitively proven.

10:47.881 --> 10:49.750
Tell that
to Georg Wilhelm Richmann.

10:49.783 --> 10:51.084
- Yes, yes.
- Who?

10:51.118 --> 10:52.419
An 18th century physicist.

10:52.452 --> 10:54.421
While conducting experiments
during a thunderstorm,

10:54.454 --> 10:56.857
he was struck in the head
and killed by...

10:56.890 --> 10:58.759
(speaking foreign language)

10:59.927 --> 11:01.862
A pale blue ball of fire.

11:03.030 --> 11:04.998
Well, witnesses
described these objects

11:05.032 --> 11:06.800
as being aimed
or directed at targets.

11:08.869 --> 11:10.738
Well, there-there's a reason
why it's...

11:10.771 --> 11:12.272
it's really difficult
to aim lightning.

11:12.305 --> 11:14.174
In a thundercloud,

11:14.207 --> 11:16.710
frozen raindrops
bump each other,

11:16.744 --> 11:18.946
the collisions
creating an electric charge.

11:18.979 --> 11:22.750
The positive charges, protons,
form at the top of the cloud,

11:22.783 --> 11:25.252
and the negative charges,
electrons, form at the bottom.

11:25.285 --> 11:28.488
And, since opposites attract,
that causes a positive charge

11:28.521 --> 11:31.725
to build up on the ground
beneath the cloud.

11:31.759 --> 11:33.293
The charge coming up
from these points

11:33.326 --> 11:34.928
will eventually connect
with the charge

11:34.962 --> 11:37.898
reaching down from the cloud,
and-- zap!-- lightning.

11:37.931 --> 11:39.166
And so, it's like
static electricity.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.001
I could rub my feet
on the carpet,

11:41.034 --> 11:43.070
but that doesn't mean I
can shoot the electrons at you.

11:43.103 --> 11:44.237
Yeah, the trick
is creating lightning

11:44.271 --> 11:45.973
- that you can aim.
- Exactly.

11:46.006 --> 11:47.440
Hasn't stopped people
from trying.

11:47.474 --> 11:49.910
The Air Force's ongoing
SHIVA Star program

11:49.943 --> 11:51.244
has been attempting to create
plasma projectiles.

11:51.278 --> 11:52.980
Ongoing?

11:53.013 --> 11:54.815
Well, officially, they say they
killed the project, but...

11:54.848 --> 11:56.416
Please stand by.

12:02.489 --> 12:04.391
Hmm.

12:04.424 --> 12:07.928
I have confirmed that SHIVA Star
is no longer operational.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.763
How?

12:09.797 --> 12:10.964
Cell phone.

12:14.134 --> 12:16.169
MAN: I've been the caretaker
here at Goathart

12:16.203 --> 12:17.771
ever since it closed.

12:18.906 --> 12:20.874
Make weekly rounds,
check locks.

12:20.908 --> 12:23.510
Make sure nothing
is vandalized or stolen.

12:23.543 --> 12:25.245
Look around all you like,

12:25.278 --> 12:28.248
but I haven't seen anyone
on the base for years.

12:28.281 --> 12:30.450
Were you here last night
when our victim was killed?

12:30.483 --> 12:32.920
No reason to be out here
at night.

12:32.953 --> 12:35.923
You ever hear or see anything
out of the ordinary on the base?

12:35.956 --> 12:39.893
Like what,
ghosts of dead test pilots?

12:39.927 --> 12:42.362
(laughing)

12:42.395 --> 12:45.065
Why do I feel like I'm
in a Scooby-Doo cartoon?

12:45.098 --> 12:47.000
Jinkies, Fred, I don't know.

12:47.034 --> 12:48.235
MAN:
Well, have at it.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.838
I'll open up the next hangar.

12:50.871 --> 12:52.806
(laughing)

12:58.178 --> 13:00.047
COLBY:
What's that?

13:00.080 --> 13:01.949
Sucralfate.

13:01.982 --> 13:04.051
Isn't that for ulcers?

13:04.084 --> 13:05.085
Yeah.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.119
And cancer patients,

13:06.153 --> 13:08.521
when they get ulcers
from radiation treatment.

13:08.555 --> 13:11.491
Expires November 2011.

13:11.524 --> 13:13.994
Someone was out here
recently.

13:14.027 --> 13:16.529
What does a ghost
from outer space want

13:16.563 --> 13:18.798
with stomach medication?

13:20.267 --> 13:22.569
(typing)

13:37.050 --> 13:39.186
I didn't know the desert
got so cold at night.

13:39.219 --> 13:41.088
COLBY (over radio):
Well, somebody just had to go

13:41.121 --> 13:44.224
and find evidence to warrant
a stakeout, didn't they?

13:44.257 --> 13:46.326
I'm just going to shut up
and drink my coffee.

13:46.359 --> 13:49.129
(typing)

13:49.162 --> 13:50.563
DAVID: How about we look out
for something

13:50.597 --> 13:51.999
that will justify
this little field trip.

13:56.937 --> 13:58.105
COLBY:
Hold on.

13:58.138 --> 14:00.440
- NIKKI: What do you got?
- DAVID: Yeah, I saw it, too.

14:00.473 --> 14:02.409
Light over the ridge.

14:12.152 --> 14:13.286
C-34 clear.

14:13.320 --> 14:14.454
How do we look, John?

14:14.487 --> 14:16.023
We're good.

14:16.056 --> 14:19.126
(low humming)

14:19.159 --> 14:20.894
COLBY:
You guys hear that?

14:20.928 --> 14:22.095
DAVID (over radio):
Yeah.

14:29.069 --> 14:30.470
COLBY (over radio):
Is there anyone inside?

14:30.503 --> 14:32.305
NIKKI:
I can't tell.

14:34.174 --> 14:38.111
MAN (over radio): Firestrike,
prepare for target acquisition.

14:38.145 --> 14:40.047
Your skin feel weird?

14:40.080 --> 14:41.481
Kind of tingly?

14:41.514 --> 14:42.950
Yeah.

14:44.684 --> 14:46.920
CQ-Conquest, this is Firestrike.

14:46.954 --> 14:48.188
P.E.P. frontier at two,

14:48.221 --> 14:51.024
two megajoules at 150 kV.

14:51.058 --> 14:52.559
People,
we're outside the envelope.

14:52.592 --> 14:54.527
If someone in that van
could get hurt

14:54.561 --> 14:57.530
or is doing something they
shouldn't, we have to go in.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.166
(over radio):
Firestrike, CQ-Conquest.

14:59.199 --> 15:00.267
Recommend evacuation of target
zone.

15:00.300 --> 15:01.434
Got it.

15:01.468 --> 15:02.970
Got it!

15:04.171 --> 15:06.239
(humming continues,
growing louder)

15:08.008 --> 15:11.344
(engine starter cranks weakly)

15:11.378 --> 15:12.980
Evacuate the vehicle.

15:13.013 --> 15:14.281
(strong, deep buzz)

15:14.314 --> 15:15.648
(explosion booming)

15:26.226 --> 15:27.727
DAVID:
The M.E. has the bodies.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.397
We're hoping to find I.D.
on at least one of them.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.232
- Well, what's the problem?
- They're in pretty bad shape.

15:32.265 --> 15:34.501
It's going to take some time
to figure out what's flesh

15:34.534 --> 15:35.568
and what's clothes, you know.

15:35.602 --> 15:36.669
What's in the van?

15:36.703 --> 15:37.670
Uh, it's high-tech gear.

15:37.704 --> 15:39.172
It's all pretty fried, though.

15:39.206 --> 15:41.541
Well, this
is a strange development.

15:41.574 --> 15:44.044
Yeah? What do you know about it?

15:44.077 --> 15:45.745
Agent Eppes,
I am as mystified as you are.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.347
Perhaps we're looking
at some form

15:47.380 --> 15:49.249
of high-energy weaponry.

15:49.282 --> 15:50.417
Thanks for that, Floyd.

15:50.450 --> 15:51.718
My brother could have
told me that.

15:51.751 --> 15:53.520
Charlie
is an excellent resource.

15:53.553 --> 15:54.754
I'm hoping he
can tell me something

15:54.787 --> 15:56.356
about the contents of that van.

15:57.490 --> 15:59.292
Think he's holding out on us?

15:59.326 --> 16:01.594
I don't know what
the deal is with this guy.

16:01.628 --> 16:02.996
CHARLIE:
Ooh.

16:03.030 --> 16:05.332
Looks like diagnostic equipment.

16:05.365 --> 16:06.766
Serious computing power.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.535
So, what do you think,
more UFO hunters?

16:08.568 --> 16:09.736
No, no, no, this is...

16:09.769 --> 16:11.271
this is, like,
special equipment.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.206
It's very sophisticated
and expensive.

16:13.240 --> 16:14.507
Designed to do what?

16:14.541 --> 16:15.608
I don't know.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.210
Something complex.

16:17.244 --> 16:19.379
Oh, this is... this is some sort

16:19.412 --> 16:22.215
of viscous material here.

16:22.249 --> 16:26.019
Charlie, yeah, actually,
I think that's part of a guy.

16:26.053 --> 16:28.021
Oh. Well, okay.

16:28.055 --> 16:30.790
Uh, whoever was in this van

16:30.823 --> 16:32.559
had some cutting-edge
equipment,

16:32.592 --> 16:36.363
and some of it's capable of,
uh, monitoring and tracking.

16:36.396 --> 16:37.297
Okay?

16:41.268 --> 16:43.403
RIDENHOUR:
We've I.D.'d all three bodies.

16:43.436 --> 16:45.405
Each had an employee I.D.

16:45.438 --> 16:48.041
for a company-- Neox Industries.

16:48.075 --> 16:51.578
Daniel Stymeyer, John Evans,
Richard Zezwitz.

16:53.113 --> 16:54.414
Do we know what killed them?

16:54.447 --> 16:56.749
Being blown up.

16:56.783 --> 16:58.518
There were burns--
radiation burns.

16:58.551 --> 17:00.620
Maybe an intense
X-ray exposure.

17:00.653 --> 17:03.490
What, X-rays can cause
a van to explode?

17:03.523 --> 17:05.625
They're powerful
when concentrated.

17:05.658 --> 17:08.395
Between this and the Jane Doe
that died earlier,

17:08.428 --> 17:10.763
there's some intense energy
source operating out there.

17:10.797 --> 17:12.299
Well, we need to find out

17:12.332 --> 17:14.134
what kind of work
Neox Industries does,

17:14.167 --> 17:15.802
and if they're missing
a female employee.

17:18.505 --> 17:21.374
DAVID: Cynthia Abbott,
employee of Neox Industries,

17:21.408 --> 17:23.676
reported missing two days ago.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.745
Her size matches the body
we found at the airfield,

17:25.778 --> 17:27.747
so we just need some DNA
for final confirmation.

17:27.780 --> 17:30.317
She worked at the same company
as our three toasted guys.

17:30.350 --> 17:32.452
DAVID:
All four were engineers.

17:32.485 --> 17:34.121
Neox Industries' Web site says

17:34.154 --> 17:37.190
it develops "specialized
preventative applications."

17:37.224 --> 17:39.192
That sounds like weaponry to me.

17:39.226 --> 17:42.595
I wonder why they haven't
reported four missing employees.

17:42.629 --> 17:44.231
I can't wait to ask them.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.567
John, Dan and Rich
weren't even working last night.

17:47.600 --> 17:48.868
How can they be dead?

17:48.901 --> 17:49.936
Well, they were identified

17:49.969 --> 17:52.505
by, uh, personal effects
and their dental records.

17:52.539 --> 17:54.707
Oh, my God, this is horrible.

17:54.741 --> 17:57.744
I'll have to notify
people-- families.

17:57.777 --> 17:59.746
I suppose I should ask how.

17:59.779 --> 18:02.349
Only if you don't already know.

18:02.382 --> 18:04.684
What were your three employees
working on out there?

18:06.353 --> 18:08.855
I signed a confidentiality
agreement

18:08.888 --> 18:10.557
with the government.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.459
I can't discuss that.

18:12.492 --> 18:14.427
Well, we have top
security clearance.

18:14.461 --> 18:16.463
That says I can't discuss
our federal contracts.

18:16.496 --> 18:18.265
Not with the FBI,
not with anybody.

18:18.298 --> 18:21.734
If I do, I'm violating
national security laws.

18:21.768 --> 18:24.137
You understand
we can't walk away

18:24.171 --> 18:25.772
when four people are dead.

18:25.805 --> 18:27.240
Four? You said three.

18:27.274 --> 18:28.208
We found another body

18:28.241 --> 18:29.909
in a separate incident
that we also believe

18:29.942 --> 18:32.145
to be one of your employees--
Cynthia Abbott.

18:32.179 --> 18:34.347
Cynthia?

18:34.381 --> 18:35.915
No, no, no. That's impossible.

18:35.948 --> 18:37.384
She wasn't even working
on the...

18:39.619 --> 18:41.888
This project.

18:43.390 --> 18:45.525
MAN:
Cyndi and I have been

18:45.558 --> 18:47.727
living together
for about six months.

18:49.962 --> 18:50.930
What's happened to her?

18:50.963 --> 18:52.799
We don't know yet.

18:54.434 --> 18:57.170
What can you tell us
about Cynthia's work

18:57.204 --> 18:58.238
at Neox Industries?

18:58.271 --> 19:00.673
Uh, she didn't talk about it.

19:00.707 --> 19:03.176
Only that it involved
her specialty.

19:03.210 --> 19:04.777
- And what was that?
- Plasma physics.

19:04.811 --> 19:06.879
She did say something

19:06.913 --> 19:08.715
about being dropped
off a project,

19:08.748 --> 19:10.617
but she didn't say what it was.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.885
And do you have
a recent photo of Cynthia?

19:12.919 --> 19:14.687
Yeah.

19:14.721 --> 19:16.889
She volunteers as a tutor.

19:16.923 --> 19:18.858
She donates her time
to Habitat for Humanity.

19:18.891 --> 19:21.194
She... cares about things.

19:21.228 --> 19:23.696
I can't see why anybody
would hurt her.

19:23.730 --> 19:24.831
Does she have a computer
at home?

19:24.864 --> 19:25.965
Yeah, you need to see it?

19:25.998 --> 19:28.301
Yeah, we do,
and we also need a sample

19:28.335 --> 19:29.502
of her DNA-- a toothbrush,

19:29.536 --> 19:30.837
- for instance.
- Why?

19:30.870 --> 19:31.938
Did you find something?

19:31.971 --> 19:32.939
No, it's just routine.

19:39.412 --> 19:41.348
Well, Neox has a government
defense contract, so...

19:41.381 --> 19:42.682
Well, that explains
the secrecy.

19:42.715 --> 19:43.950
Oh!

19:43.983 --> 19:46.353
- CHARLIE: Floyd?
- Floyd?

19:46.386 --> 19:48.588
I have an important question
I need to ask you.

19:48.621 --> 19:50.990
Have you had the pie at
the restaurant down the street?

19:51.023 --> 19:52.392
You mean Pie 'N' Burger?

19:52.425 --> 19:53.526
Is that the name?

19:53.560 --> 19:54.994
That's a good name.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.596
Because it's astounding pie.

19:56.629 --> 19:57.930
Yes, it is.

19:57.964 --> 19:59.932
You came all the way
out here for pie?

19:59.966 --> 20:01.934
No, but putting
all talk of pie aside

20:01.968 --> 20:03.670
for a future time,
I have new information.

20:03.703 --> 20:04.904
Due to the deaths
of the engineers,

20:04.937 --> 20:08.441
I was able to get certain data
released to me.

20:08.475 --> 20:10.243
It might help you
with your work.

20:10.277 --> 20:11.878
Well, you work
at the Pentagon, right?

20:11.911 --> 20:13.946
So, Neox has a defense project.

20:13.980 --> 20:16.883
I would think you would know
what it's working on.

20:16.916 --> 20:18.718
Department 44
is only responsible

20:18.751 --> 20:21.721
for verifying that
these projects come in on time

20:21.754 --> 20:23.590
and on budget.

20:23.623 --> 20:24.957
So, you're some sort
of auditor.

20:24.991 --> 20:28.261
Uh... some sort,
Dr. Ramanujan, yes.

20:28.295 --> 20:29.329
I'm sorry.

20:29.362 --> 20:30.497
Have... have we met?

20:30.530 --> 20:32.031
No, but I am familiar
with your work,

20:32.064 --> 20:36.936
particularly that pertaining
to satellite telemetry.

20:36.969 --> 20:38.638
Nifty stuff.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.273
Thank you.

20:40.307 --> 20:41.641
CHARLIE:
Hey, listen, Floyd, we need

20:41.674 --> 20:43.042
to know as much as possible

20:43.075 --> 20:44.944
if we're going to get anywhere
with this investigation.

20:44.977 --> 20:46.045
At this point, all I know

20:46.078 --> 20:48.448
is that the Neox Industries
contract

20:48.481 --> 20:49.982
involves "less lethal" weaponry.

20:50.016 --> 20:51.684
As opposed to nonlethal.

20:51.718 --> 20:53.753
Devices that frighten
or disable.

20:53.786 --> 20:55.288
CHARLIE:
Less lethal would mean

20:55.322 --> 20:56.523
directed energy weapons,

20:56.556 --> 20:57.990
like microwaves,
particle beams, lasers.

20:58.024 --> 20:59.326
AMITA:
Makes more sense

20:59.359 --> 21:00.960
than ETs or ghosts.

21:00.993 --> 21:02.729
The Pentagon has no contract
with aliens

21:02.762 --> 21:04.431
or with afterlife entities.

21:04.464 --> 21:07.300
That I'm aware of.

21:07.334 --> 21:08.835
At this time.

21:10.703 --> 21:14.073
The FBI has located this laptop.

21:14.106 --> 21:16.042
Belongs to Cynthia Abbott,

21:16.075 --> 21:18.811
plasma physics engineer
employed by Neox.

21:18.845 --> 21:20.347
Agent Eppes has asked
that Dr. Ramanujan

21:20.380 --> 21:21.881
examine its contents.

21:21.914 --> 21:24.083
The FBI also believes
that Dr. Abbott

21:24.116 --> 21:26.386
was the first person killed.

21:27.520 --> 21:28.955
Is there a problem?

21:28.988 --> 21:31.057
Uh-uh. Working
on a dead person's computer?

21:31.090 --> 21:32.525
Hardly my first time.

21:32.559 --> 21:35.061
No, I imagine it's not.

21:36.095 --> 21:38.398
ALAN:
I don't know, Donnie.

21:38.431 --> 21:40.099
I'm not quite sure
what you're getting at, though.

21:40.132 --> 21:42.435
I'm just saying, the major
turning points in your life--

21:42.469 --> 21:43.570
were they actually decisions,

21:43.603 --> 21:45.372
like, planned out?

21:45.405 --> 21:46.606
Oh.

21:46.639 --> 21:47.974
Well, let's see.

21:48.007 --> 21:49.542
Uh...
(grunts)

21:49.576 --> 21:51.378
I chose to go to college.

21:51.411 --> 21:53.746
I met your mom,
which I didn't choose.

21:53.780 --> 21:56.082
I chose to marry her.

21:56.115 --> 21:58.585
She got pregnant.

21:58.618 --> 22:01.888
I chose to study architecture,
but, uh,

22:01.921 --> 22:03.656
I needed a job,

22:03.690 --> 22:05.925
so I took a job with the city.

22:05.958 --> 22:06.859
Well, like having two sons.

22:06.893 --> 22:09.362
You know, I mean,
you didn't choose that.

22:09.396 --> 22:10.763
Oh, I chose to have children.

22:10.797 --> 22:12.965
Had to take what I got,
didn't I?

22:12.999 --> 22:14.934
(laughs)

22:14.967 --> 22:15.935
What is it,

22:15.968 --> 22:17.804
you're second-guessing
about some decisions?

22:17.837 --> 22:19.372
I don't know. I just...

22:19.406 --> 22:21.541
It's like-- I feel,
with all the big ones,

22:21.574 --> 22:23.976
really, it was by default.

22:24.010 --> 22:25.778
FBI was just a fallback

22:25.812 --> 22:28.147
'cause I didn't have the goods
to play pro ball.

22:28.180 --> 22:30.950
Well, maybe you have
to make some plans of your own.

22:30.983 --> 22:32.419
Yeah, well,
it never really occurred to me

22:32.452 --> 22:33.586
that I-I wasn't doing that.

22:33.620 --> 22:34.721
I'm afraid

22:34.754 --> 22:35.855
you're gonna have
to ask yourself

22:35.888 --> 22:36.789
what you really want in life.

22:38.958 --> 22:40.460
Want a lot of things, Dad.

22:46.699 --> 22:49.502
I got into
Cynthia Abbott's laptop.

22:49.536 --> 22:51.037
There's no Neox Industries
work on it,

22:51.070 --> 22:53.105
but she did send a couple
e-mails that mentioned it.

22:53.139 --> 22:54.674
She says that Neox was going

22:54.707 --> 22:56.409
to field-test a system
that wasn't ready.

22:56.443 --> 22:57.544
She knew where the test was

22:57.577 --> 22:59.712
- and planned to watch.
- Well,

22:59.746 --> 23:02.114
she was struck by a plasma
toroid device from above,

23:02.148 --> 23:04.417
which would indicate
an aircraft delivery platform.

23:04.451 --> 23:07.119
Well, here's information
about a new type of aircraft--

23:07.153 --> 23:09.188
a small military drone

23:09.221 --> 23:11.658
capable of supporting
directed-energy weaponry.

23:11.691 --> 23:14.060
Whoa. Is this some top-secret
government site

23:14.093 --> 23:15.495
you've hacked into?

23:15.528 --> 23:19.732
No. It's Wiredmagazine online
discussion board Otto IM'ed me.

23:19.766 --> 23:21.133
What about the van with

23:21.167 --> 23:23.002
the three engineers?
What type of weapons platform

23:23.035 --> 23:24.203
was used?

23:24.236 --> 23:26.573
I don't know,
but we can find out.

23:29.175 --> 23:31.143
CHARLIE: Well, we've got David
and Colby's report,

23:31.177 --> 23:33.880
and we've got these track marks
on the ground here,

23:33.913 --> 23:36.783
so I'm thinking we can use those
to calculate the force

23:36.816 --> 23:39.218
that struck the vehicle
and possibly the direction.

23:39.251 --> 23:40.953
Yeah, I think
we've got a good shot.

23:40.987 --> 23:43.022
- FLOYD: Hello. (gasps)
- Oh!

23:43.055 --> 23:47.660
Floyd, you got to stop
materializing like that.

23:47.694 --> 23:48.861
Oh. Sorry.

23:48.895 --> 23:51.698
May I inquire
what you're doing out here?

23:51.731 --> 23:53.500
Just trying to get an idea

23:53.533 --> 23:54.834
of where that energy burst
came from.

23:54.867 --> 23:55.568
Mmm.

23:55.602 --> 23:58.505
AMITA:
What are you doing here?

23:58.538 --> 24:00.740
Oh, I thought I'd try
to experience the ambiance

24:00.773 --> 24:02.542
of the scene at night.

24:02.575 --> 24:05.678
Your idea sounds
much more practical.

24:05.712 --> 24:06.813
Can I help?

24:06.846 --> 24:08.548
Sure. You, uh...
you got a flashlight?

24:21.928 --> 24:24.497
There's something here.

24:26.599 --> 24:27.834
CHARLIE:
It's a sheep.

24:27.867 --> 24:29.802
AMITA:
What could have done this?

24:29.836 --> 24:31.504
FLOYD:
Chupacabra?

24:31.538 --> 24:34.140
AMITA: Legendary bloodsucking
creature from South America?

24:34.173 --> 24:35.274
Seriously?

24:35.307 --> 24:36.375
No. I'm joking.

24:36.408 --> 24:39.111
Much more likely explanation
is that it was killed

24:39.145 --> 24:40.680
by some high-energy weapon.

24:40.713 --> 24:42.281
CHARLIE:
Well, look here.

24:42.314 --> 24:46.686
Engineering shorthand
scribbled on a washing machine.

24:46.719 --> 24:48.555
These are targeting coordinates.

24:48.588 --> 24:51.190
Oh, yeah.

24:51.223 --> 24:52.925
- There's another one.
- Well, how about that?

24:52.959 --> 24:54.627
AMITA:
They were testing the weapon

24:54.661 --> 24:57.096
against live animals
and objects.

24:57.129 --> 24:58.998
Ooh, I just saw a flash
over here.

25:04.203 --> 25:05.772
AMITA:
What is that?

25:05.805 --> 25:07.740
CHARLIE:
Looks like an unmanned drone.

25:07.774 --> 25:10.577
FLOYD:
Ah, MK-15 Shadow Hawk.

25:10.610 --> 25:12.612
National Aeronautical Dynamics.

25:12.645 --> 25:15.047
First flight,
February 2, 2008.

25:15.081 --> 25:17.950
Principal user--
United States Air Force.

25:17.984 --> 25:20.620
Unit cost 12.5
million U.S. dollars.

25:20.653 --> 25:22.555
Sensors included.

25:22.589 --> 25:24.557
AMITA:
What is it doing here?

25:24.591 --> 25:26.225
I have no idea.

25:26.258 --> 25:27.760
CHARLIE:
This is some sort of laser.

25:27.794 --> 25:29.662
A laser-induced plasma channel.

25:29.696 --> 25:32.832
It creates a channel in the air
that allows the system

25:32.865 --> 25:34.734
to fire a bolt of electricity
along it.

25:34.767 --> 25:37.870
A bolt of lightning you can aim?

25:37.904 --> 25:39.972
We've found our murder weapon.

25:48.881 --> 25:51.217
COLBY: Okay, so this thing
killed four people?

25:51.250 --> 25:52.585
And several sheep.

25:52.619 --> 25:53.920
The question is,

25:53.953 --> 25:55.588
why would they leave it
out there?

25:55.622 --> 25:56.923
Well, maybe
it malfunctioned and crashed,

25:56.956 --> 25:58.858
and whoever was operating it
got scared

25:58.891 --> 26:00.793
- of being caught and took off.
- NIKKI: Hey, we got turned down

26:00.827 --> 26:03.062
by a federal judge for the
Neox Industries subpoena.

26:03.095 --> 26:05.064
Yeah, a Defense Department
lawyer

26:05.097 --> 26:07.066
cited the project's
classified status.

26:07.099 --> 26:08.601
FLOYD:
Well, that's not optimal.

26:08.635 --> 26:09.936
Wh-what? You work
for the Pentagon.

26:09.969 --> 26:11.971
- What do you mean?
- Oh, different department.

26:12.004 --> 26:13.072
Although, I can understand
how it looks.

26:13.105 --> 26:14.607
DON: No, no, no,
I'm tired of this.

26:14.641 --> 26:15.875
Here's the deal--
either you fix it,

26:15.908 --> 26:18.077
- or you're out of here.
- Well,

26:18.110 --> 26:20.279
I guess that's a clear mandate.

26:23.950 --> 26:26.318
- What was that?
- I have no idea.

26:26.352 --> 26:28.688
NIKKI: Four dead people,
we can't cut any red tape.

26:28.721 --> 26:29.956
(phone rings)
This experimental weapons

26:29.989 --> 26:31.958
system must have some
serious money behind it.

26:31.991 --> 26:34.326
Ah, these government contracts
usually involve billions.

26:34.360 --> 26:37.329
Cynthia Abbott knew something
was wrong at Neox.

26:37.363 --> 26:39.331
- And now she's dead.
- That was David.

26:39.365 --> 26:42.268
The woman killed at Goathart
was not Cynthia Abbott.

26:42.301 --> 26:44.671
DNA match came up negative.

26:44.704 --> 26:45.838
Okay, if that's not Abbott,
then who is it?

26:45.872 --> 26:47.907
- And where the hell isAbbott?
- And what do we

26:47.940 --> 26:49.809
really know
about Mr. Department 44?

26:49.842 --> 26:51.911
I can report some progress.

26:55.447 --> 26:58.685
- What are you doing?
- Uh, please stand by.

26:58.718 --> 27:00.352
Again with the invisible
cell phone.

27:00.386 --> 27:01.854
Floyd, this better be useful.

27:01.888 --> 27:03.055
Oh.

27:03.089 --> 27:04.023
(laughs)

27:04.056 --> 27:05.692
Yes, it is-- very useful--

27:05.725 --> 27:07.927
and if I may say,
quite unexpected.

27:07.960 --> 27:10.362
(pounding on door)
DAVID: FBI! Open the door.

27:10.396 --> 27:11.664
Go!

27:17.136 --> 27:18.204
I want to see I.D.s.

27:18.237 --> 27:20.172
Cynthia Abbott?

27:20.206 --> 27:21.307
What if I am?

27:21.340 --> 27:22.809
It's not illegal

27:22.842 --> 27:24.911
to stay in a hotel
without telling anybody.

27:24.944 --> 27:27.079
DAVID:
How did you know she was here?

27:27.113 --> 27:28.214
Well, she's a scientist

27:28.247 --> 27:29.849
with expertise
in plasma physics,

27:29.882 --> 27:31.951
employed by a firm
with government contracts

27:31.984 --> 27:33.119
for classified weaponry.

27:33.152 --> 27:35.688
She's been implanted
with a microchip

27:35.722 --> 27:37.724
so that she can be
located at any time.

27:37.757 --> 27:39.926
A microchip?

27:39.959 --> 27:41.427
Are you serious?

27:41.460 --> 27:43.963
Do I appear not to be serious?

27:43.996 --> 27:47.299
If she has a locator in her,
why is she trying to hide?

27:47.333 --> 27:49.902
The microchip was implanted
without her knowledge.

27:56.108 --> 27:58.077
I wanted to watch
the field test.

27:58.110 --> 28:00.146
I didn't know they were going
to kill somebody.

28:00.179 --> 28:02.081
You saw the murder?

28:02.114 --> 28:03.315
It was horrible.

28:03.349 --> 28:04.851
Could you identify the body?

28:04.884 --> 28:07.319
I was too far away
to see her face.

28:07.353 --> 28:09.722
Well, why run?
Why not go to the police?

28:09.756 --> 28:11.791
Police can't protect me.

28:11.824 --> 28:13.860
The contract's worth billions.

28:13.893 --> 28:16.062
And I know they can't deliver.

28:16.095 --> 28:17.196
Did your boyfriend lie for you?

28:17.229 --> 28:18.130
Herbie has no idea.

28:18.164 --> 28:20.767
I figured it was safer
for him that way.

28:20.800 --> 28:22.935
What kind of weapon
is Neox developing?

28:22.969 --> 28:25.738
It's a laser-induced
plasma channel gun.

28:25.772 --> 28:27.206
Um...

28:27.239 --> 28:29.909
a lightning gun.

28:29.942 --> 28:31.778
You work
for a government agency

28:31.811 --> 28:33.279
that puts microchips
in people's heads.

28:33.312 --> 28:35.147
I mean, you can understand
if we think

28:35.181 --> 28:37.049
that maybe you've
been holding back on us.

28:37.083 --> 28:39.251
Well, Department 44 did not
perform the actual implantation.

28:39.285 --> 28:41.087
You know more
than you're telling us.

28:41.120 --> 28:43.089
I told you everything
I knew to be true

28:43.122 --> 28:44.791
when I knew it to be true.

28:44.824 --> 28:46.225
- What does that even mean?
- Have you ever heard

28:46.258 --> 28:48.027
of the Bronson Infantry
Fighting Vehicle?

28:48.060 --> 28:49.495
Yeah. The tank?

28:49.528 --> 28:52.765
Well, the initial design
contract was for $40 million,

28:52.799 --> 28:54.100
but after 17 years,

28:54.133 --> 28:55.367
there was no working design,

28:55.401 --> 28:57.203
and the cost hit $14 billion.

28:57.236 --> 28:58.404
Billion?

28:58.437 --> 29:00.139
"B." Billion.

29:00.172 --> 29:03.075
Tests were faked,
results falsified--

29:03.109 --> 29:06.112
by the contractor, but also
by generals at the Pentagon

29:06.145 --> 29:08.114
who were overseeing the project.

29:08.147 --> 29:09.315
You're saying
that Pentagon officials

29:09.348 --> 29:11.517
that know about Neox aren't
telling you what's going on?

29:11.550 --> 29:14.186
We know from experience

29:14.220 --> 29:16.288
that that
is the likely scenario.

29:16.322 --> 29:18.290
Floyd, you're going
to tell us everything you know.

29:18.324 --> 29:19.959
If I know it.

29:19.992 --> 29:22.128
Again, what does that mean?

29:22.161 --> 29:24.296
I want a list of Neox
employees, all right?!

29:24.330 --> 29:27.433
Well, then, I shall reach out.

29:36.008 --> 29:37.509
- Hey, Amita.
- Hey.

29:37.543 --> 29:39.078
Oh, thanks for coming over.

29:39.111 --> 29:41.213
Sure. I don't have
a class until 3:00.

29:41.247 --> 29:43.916
Good. Uh, it's just
that, um,

29:43.950 --> 29:46.185
I-I have something for you.

29:46.218 --> 29:49.155
Alan, you promised--
no engagement gifts.

29:49.188 --> 29:50.289
No, it's not a gift.

29:50.322 --> 29:52.258
It's, um...
it's just something

29:52.291 --> 29:55.194
that somebody wanted me
to give to you.

29:58.497 --> 30:00.466
It was, uh,

30:00.499 --> 30:02.401
my wife, Margaret's.

30:04.904 --> 30:07.073
Actually, it was given

30:07.106 --> 30:09.842
to her great-great-grandmother
for her 21st birthday.

30:09.876 --> 30:11.911
(sighs)

30:13.145 --> 30:14.180
Alan, I...

30:14.213 --> 30:15.214
Well, we never had a daughter,

30:15.247 --> 30:16.382
so Margaret wanted me

30:16.415 --> 30:17.917
to give it
to our daughter-in-law.

30:19.051 --> 30:21.320
I'm not married to Charlie yet.

30:21.353 --> 30:23.255
You've been a member
of our family for quite a while.

30:26.893 --> 30:30.462
Um, why today?

30:30.496 --> 30:33.065
Well, um...

30:33.099 --> 30:35.101
it's Margaret's birthday.

30:36.602 --> 30:38.370
So, it's my present to her.

30:42.608 --> 30:45.077
Thank you.

30:45.111 --> 30:47.179
(computer beeps)

30:47.213 --> 30:49.215
(computer chirping)

30:57.589 --> 30:59.058
What's this guy up to?

30:59.091 --> 31:01.293
List of Neox Industries'
employees.

31:04.496 --> 31:06.498
Hey, that woman killed
at the airfield that night?

31:06.532 --> 31:08.600
Finally got a possible I.D.

31:08.634 --> 31:10.569
Alison Williams, vice president
of Neox Industries.

31:10.602 --> 31:13.072
Was she reported missing?

31:13.105 --> 31:14.473
No, but I checked
with her neighbors.

31:14.506 --> 31:15.641
They heard her cat crying.

31:15.674 --> 31:17.443
They said she would
have never left it

31:17.476 --> 31:18.978
without having
someone to feed it.

31:19.011 --> 31:20.612
All right,
what do they say at Neox?

31:20.646 --> 31:22.014
That she's on leave.

31:22.048 --> 31:23.315
She's not a scientist.

31:23.349 --> 31:24.583
She's a contract liaison.

31:24.616 --> 31:25.551
In other words,
head salesperson.

31:25.584 --> 31:27.920
She could be the body
from the field test.

31:27.954 --> 31:29.155
One way to find out.

31:29.188 --> 31:30.889
Let's get to her apartment,
get some DNA.

31:33.592 --> 31:35.294
ALAN:
Hi, boys.

31:35.327 --> 31:37.163
Come to witness my defeat?

31:37.196 --> 31:39.531
I bet you wish Larry
was still in town.

31:39.565 --> 31:41.300
She's a lot harder to beat.

31:41.333 --> 31:43.469
Well, I enjoy the challenge.

31:43.502 --> 31:47.139
Fleinhardt's a good man,
but a mediocre chess player.

31:47.173 --> 31:48.941
I miss Larry.

31:48.975 --> 31:50.609
Oh, he'll be back.
He always comes back.

31:50.642 --> 31:52.311
Well, one of the nice outcomes

31:52.344 --> 31:54.313
of Larry leaving
is that you and Amita

31:54.346 --> 31:55.982
seem to be spending
a lot more time together.

31:56.015 --> 31:57.516
You know one of my true regrets

31:57.549 --> 31:58.951
in life
is not having a daughter.

31:58.985 --> 32:00.552
But you know something?

32:00.586 --> 32:02.688
Daughter-in-law is just as good.

32:02.721 --> 32:04.523
Well, you got the daughter
you always wanted, see?

32:04.556 --> 32:06.625
So, things do work out
in the end.

32:06.658 --> 32:08.560
And with any luck,
I'd have two daughters-in-law.

32:08.594 --> 32:11.964
CHARLIE: Well, isn't the clichГ©
that people hate their in-laws?

32:11.998 --> 32:13.599
You get along better with her
than you do with him or me.

32:13.632 --> 32:15.367
Yeah, what's that?
Just 'cause she's prettier?

32:15.401 --> 32:17.436
- Mm-hmm. (phone rings)
-AMITA: Well, it's easy

32:17.469 --> 32:18.537
to like other people's parents.

32:18.570 --> 32:20.539
It's your own parents
that present the challenge.

32:20.572 --> 32:22.708
Hey, this is Otto.
He's got something. Come on.

32:22.741 --> 32:24.576
- DON: Hey, keep me posted,
- Aah!

32:24.610 --> 32:27.046
Here, I'll take over.

32:27.079 --> 32:28.614
So, Cynthia Abbott was able

32:28.647 --> 32:30.983
to provide us with files
on the Neox project.

32:31.017 --> 32:32.518
Yes, yes,
I've analyzed test data

32:32.551 --> 32:34.420
from the dense plasma driver

32:34.453 --> 32:36.222
here under the magnetic coils.

32:36.255 --> 32:37.389
A lot of problems.

32:37.423 --> 32:38.557
It looks like it's designed

32:38.590 --> 32:40.659
to create a toroid
of high-density plasma.

32:40.692 --> 32:41.860
Yes, yes, uh,
one that is supposed

32:41.893 --> 32:44.630
to shower a target with X-rays
to disable electronics...

32:44.663 --> 32:47.466
Or an electrical field that
stops a person's motor controls.

32:47.499 --> 32:48.600
CHARLIE:
Yeah, well,

32:48.634 --> 32:50.402
instead, it killed four people.

32:50.436 --> 32:53.239
Uh, the plasma driver adjusts
itself to be way too powerful.

32:53.272 --> 32:55.641
It adjusts itself?

32:55.674 --> 32:59.045
It's automated,
intended to identify its targets

32:59.078 --> 33:00.779
and calibrate its energy output

33:00.812 --> 33:02.514
without requiring
human intervention.

33:02.548 --> 33:03.649
Yes, yes, uh,
the military developed

33:03.682 --> 33:06.118
a device for us in Iraq
called a C-RAM--

33:06.152 --> 33:08.120
a computerized counter-rocket
artillery mortar--

33:08.154 --> 33:09.488
to shoot down incoming rockets

33:09.521 --> 33:11.690
that are coming too fast
for humans to react.

33:11.723 --> 33:13.625
- Huh. Does it work?
- Well, it does now,

33:13.659 --> 33:15.461
but the first time
they powered it up,

33:15.494 --> 33:16.528
it fired
on an American helicopter.

33:16.562 --> 33:19.231
Luckily, the pilot was able
to evade the C-RAM.

33:19.265 --> 33:23.202
Dr. Eppes, I've just received
word of Internet chatter

33:23.235 --> 33:25.304
referencing
a ghost plane sighting

33:25.337 --> 33:27.606
near Goathart Air Base.

33:30.209 --> 33:33.712
CHARLIE:
We've been out here four hours.

33:33.745 --> 33:36.148
Internet chatter
is not always reliable.

33:36.182 --> 33:38.117
That's a bit
of an understatement.

33:44.723 --> 33:46.592
CHARLIE:
You, uh...

33:46.625 --> 33:50.062
you getting another call
on your invisible cell phone?

33:50.096 --> 33:53.031
No, just listening to the sounds
of the desert at night.

33:55.801 --> 33:57.736
You hear something?

33:57.769 --> 33:59.037
You hear it, too?

34:05.577 --> 34:08.614
I think that's
what we were hearing.

34:08.647 --> 34:09.648
Yeah, you think?

34:20.392 --> 34:23.829
Uh, I think it's safe to say
that they've spotted us.

34:25.431 --> 34:27.666
Is it similar
to the drone we found?

34:27.699 --> 34:30.402
I would say it's...
it's quite similar.

34:30.436 --> 34:32.104
So, there's a good chance

34:32.138 --> 34:35.674
that this one's also armed
with high-energy weaponry.

34:35.707 --> 34:37.343
(whirring)

34:37.376 --> 34:38.744
You hear that? What is that?

34:38.777 --> 34:41.513
If you feel
a tingling sensation,

34:41.547 --> 34:43.449
that's the plasma channel
opening up.

34:43.482 --> 34:46.252
Run sideways, not backwards.

34:46.285 --> 34:48.187
Okay, good to know.

34:48.220 --> 34:50.756
Why are you so calm?

34:50.789 --> 34:51.823
Panic won't do us any good.

34:58.664 --> 35:00.266
(sighs)

35:03.402 --> 35:04.803
(device whirring)

35:06.805 --> 35:09.308
(phone rings)

35:09.341 --> 35:11.310
- Sinclair.
- CHARLIE: Hey, hey, David,

35:11.343 --> 35:12.511
we-we sighted the drone.

35:12.544 --> 35:13.645
Can you give me a direction?

35:13.679 --> 35:15.381
NSA has a track on it.

35:15.414 --> 35:17.349
So, yeah,
we've got an exact track.

35:17.383 --> 35:20.286
Uh... wow, it's headed for the
hangars at Goathart Air Base.

35:20.319 --> 35:22.154
That's 21.3 miles from here.

35:22.188 --> 35:24.190
Now, listen, you need to get
there as fast as possible.

35:24.223 --> 35:26.258
Yeah.

35:31.730 --> 35:34.533
Gently, guys, gently.

35:34.566 --> 35:35.867
- Got it?
- Yeah.

35:35.901 --> 35:37.636
(siren wailing)

35:39.771 --> 35:42.374
Get this drone
out of here, guys,

35:42.408 --> 35:44.243
gently, gently.

35:49.348 --> 35:50.382
COLBY:
Let's go. Turn around.

35:58.490 --> 36:00.292
NIKKI:
Darren Drew. FBI.

36:00.326 --> 36:01.793
FBI. Stop.

36:01.827 --> 36:03.229
You can keep walking all the way

36:03.262 --> 36:04.563
to Bullhead, Arizona,
if you want.

36:07.299 --> 36:08.500
But we'll have called ahead.

36:08.534 --> 36:10.602
(panting)

36:10.636 --> 36:14.206
I am supervising
a legitimate test here.

36:14.240 --> 36:16.542
- I am not a criminal.
- COLBY: Then, come on over here

36:16.575 --> 36:18.344
and get yourself handcuffed
like a good person.

36:22.714 --> 36:23.949
You know what?

36:23.982 --> 36:25.584
You can't do this.

36:25.617 --> 36:27.986
This is a top secret
federal project.

36:28.019 --> 36:29.455
You don't have
the authority to a...

36:29.488 --> 36:32.224
No, no, no.
Hey, you cannot do this!

36:32.258 --> 36:33.792
Look, we just need more time.

36:33.825 --> 36:35.294
We can fix it.

36:35.327 --> 36:37.829
This is not how it
is supposed to work.

36:40.399 --> 36:43.402
Who killed your three
employees in that van?

36:43.435 --> 36:45.003
It was an accident.

36:45.036 --> 36:46.905
COLBY: Well, we've talked
to people on your team.

36:46.938 --> 36:48.440
There's a lot
of finger-pointing going on.

36:48.474 --> 36:50.842
DAVID: The engineers
are blaming the programmers.

36:50.876 --> 36:52.678
The coders are blaming
the designers.

36:52.711 --> 36:53.879
Yeah, but mostly,
they're blaming you,

36:53.912 --> 36:56.348
saying you wouldn't admit
that the project was in trouble.

36:56.382 --> 36:57.883
No, that... that is not true.

36:57.916 --> 37:00.018
We were very close.
We were days away.

37:00.051 --> 37:01.453
DAVID:
Not according to your engineers.

37:01.487 --> 37:03.522
DREW: They don't see
the whole picture.

37:03.555 --> 37:05.757
There is so much at stake.

37:05.791 --> 37:07.793
Really?

37:07.826 --> 37:08.960
Enough to kill for?

37:08.994 --> 37:10.796
No, of course not.

37:10.829 --> 37:12.931
DAVID:
Then, why are four people dead?

37:12.964 --> 37:16.001
Four people who were my friends.
All right?

37:16.034 --> 37:18.370
We're a small company.
We're like a family.

37:18.404 --> 37:19.705
I don't know
what happened out there,

37:19.738 --> 37:21.407
but I know none
of my people did it.

37:21.440 --> 37:23.775
It's possible
he's telling the truth,

37:23.809 --> 37:25.611
that he doesn't understand
what went wrong.

37:25.644 --> 37:26.612
He knows.

37:26.645 --> 37:28.280
I mean, it's his project.

37:28.314 --> 37:30.816
Right?

37:36.822 --> 37:39.024
- Hey.
- AMITA: Hey.

37:39.057 --> 37:40.992
So, Otto's analyzing
the Neox data

37:41.026 --> 37:42.394
from the field tests.

37:42.428 --> 37:43.595
Nobody at Neox seems to know
what happened.

37:43.629 --> 37:44.996
Isn't it here in their records?

37:45.030 --> 37:47.866
That depends on if we
can interpret their data

37:47.899 --> 37:49.000
better than they could.

37:49.034 --> 37:50.969
Yes, yes, no doubt,
this could work.

37:51.002 --> 37:53.004
- It needs tweaks, for sure.
- NIKKI: Excuse me?

37:53.038 --> 37:54.973
OTTO:
Uh, magnetized target fusion.

37:55.006 --> 37:56.675
Compress a smaller plasma load

37:56.708 --> 37:58.377
with imploding metal foil.

37:58.410 --> 37:59.645
Yes, yes.

37:59.678 --> 38:00.912
NIKKI:
Uh, what's he talking about?

38:00.946 --> 38:02.781
- Hey, Otto.
- Huh?

38:02.814 --> 38:05.751
What if I told you we needed
a working prototype in...

38:05.784 --> 38:07.018
two weeks?

38:07.052 --> 38:09.588
Yes, yes, uh, no problem.

38:09.621 --> 38:11.757
Uh, large team,
uh, MJ capacitor banks,

38:11.790 --> 38:13.459
new magnetic coils,

38:13.492 --> 38:14.960
some high-z metal,
redo the calcs.

38:14.993 --> 38:16.762
Uh, maybe a few risks involved.

38:16.795 --> 38:18.464
A few? Is he serious?

38:18.497 --> 38:19.531
He's an engineer.

38:19.565 --> 38:20.932
Many of them are like this.

38:20.966 --> 38:22.468
Like what?
Many of us are like what?

38:22.501 --> 38:24.803
Convinced that in two weeks,
you can take

38:24.836 --> 38:27.839
a problematic, mistake-ridden,
advanced technical project

38:27.873 --> 38:29.841
to a working prototype stage.

38:29.875 --> 38:31.643
Why not?

38:33.745 --> 38:36.382
Oh. I see your point.

38:36.415 --> 38:38.384
You know, that's how I got
my nickname, Otto-Bahn--

38:38.417 --> 38:40.719
'cause I'm always going,
like, 160 miles an hour.

38:40.752 --> 38:41.687
FLOYD:
Dr. Eppes, are you suggesting

38:41.720 --> 38:43.855
that this is a case
of confidence and drive

38:43.889 --> 38:45.724
overwhelming practical judgment?

38:45.757 --> 38:46.792
Not murder?

38:46.825 --> 38:49.361
Just...
the unrestrained ambitions

38:49.395 --> 38:50.996
of brilliant engineers.

38:51.029 --> 38:52.130
But unrestrained ambitions

38:52.163 --> 38:53.765
are the only way
to accomplish

38:53.799 --> 38:54.766
anything truly challenging,
right?

38:56.935 --> 38:59.705
Oh, dear.

38:59.738 --> 39:01.440
I see your point.

39:01.473 --> 39:03.642
Oh, it's almost like...

39:03.675 --> 39:05.777
I did it.

39:05.811 --> 39:08.714
Not you, but...

39:08.747 --> 39:10.649
people like you.

39:16.121 --> 39:18.690
Your engineers
were working too fast.

39:18.724 --> 39:19.891
They took too many chances.

39:19.925 --> 39:22.661
Which is why everybody
got killed.

39:22.694 --> 39:26.064
We needed more time,
but the Feds got impatient,

39:26.097 --> 39:27.999
- so Ali...
- Alison Williams,

39:28.033 --> 39:30.702
your Pentagon liaison.

39:30.736 --> 39:32.838
Ali wanted
a live human test.

39:32.871 --> 39:34.873
DAVID: Because it was supposed
to be nonlethal.

39:34.906 --> 39:36.608
It was supposed to be safe.

39:36.642 --> 39:38.877
She figured,
if we could do that,

39:38.910 --> 39:39.978
we'd get more funding

39:40.011 --> 39:41.112
and more time.

39:41.146 --> 39:43.014
She volunteered
to be the test subject.

39:43.048 --> 39:44.115
So, why the cover-up?

39:44.149 --> 39:45.517
Because, if anybody found out

39:45.551 --> 39:46.818
what we were doing,
we'd get shut down.

39:48.920 --> 39:51.490
I took the I.D. off her body.

39:51.523 --> 39:52.591
I figured...

39:52.624 --> 39:55.594
that would keep it a mystery
just long enough to...

39:56.662 --> 39:58.430
Alison believed in this project.

39:58.464 --> 40:00.532
Okay? I don't want
to let her down.

40:00.566 --> 40:02.468
- DON: And the engineers?
- They went out

40:02.501 --> 40:03.735
to test on their own.

40:03.769 --> 40:04.736
They didn't tell me.

40:04.770 --> 40:05.871
They thought I would say no.

40:05.904 --> 40:07.739
- Would you have?
- No, probably not.

40:08.840 --> 40:09.708
I believed

40:09.741 --> 40:12.744
in this project, damn it.
I still do.

40:19.751 --> 40:22.220
(exhales)

40:22.253 --> 40:24.022
Well, that's what they told me.

40:24.055 --> 40:27.693
Field supervisor, inspections,
two-year stint in DC.

40:27.726 --> 40:29.695
L.A. isn't big enough?

40:29.728 --> 40:32.798
Hey, if you want management,
you got to go to DC.

40:32.831 --> 40:34.232
All right, thanks.

40:34.265 --> 40:37.636
Appreciate you talking to
the assistant director for me.

40:37.669 --> 40:41.940
Okay, so if you were me,
what would you do next?

40:41.973 --> 40:44.510
What do you keep
asking me this stuff for?

40:44.543 --> 40:46.578
Well, come on, man,
you're like a mentor,

40:46.612 --> 40:48.013
and, you know,
you're a good agent, so...

40:48.046 --> 40:49.681
Look...

40:49.715 --> 40:50.916
I made my share of mistakes,

40:50.949 --> 40:52.784
and you, of all people,
know that, you know.

40:52.818 --> 40:54.019
I mean, I've taken
the wrong jobs,

40:54.052 --> 40:55.554
I've-I've quit the right ones.

40:55.587 --> 40:56.922
I've broken rules
I've regretted,

40:56.955 --> 40:59.224
and I've followed rules
I should have ignored.

40:59.257 --> 41:01.092
Even when I'm doing
what I should be doing,

41:01.126 --> 41:04.162
sometimes it feels
like it's for the wrong reasons.

41:04.195 --> 41:05.230
You know what I'm saying?

41:05.263 --> 41:06.798
I think I do.

41:06.832 --> 41:10.001
I don't even know if I should
be in the field anymore.

41:10.035 --> 41:12.237
Ah, don't start talking crazy.

41:13.572 --> 41:15.841
Right.

41:15.874 --> 41:18.877
Well, let me give you
some advice.

41:20.011 --> 41:21.947
Stop being so hard on yourself.

41:21.980 --> 41:23.081
Seriously.

41:23.114 --> 41:26.752
For a Jewish guy, you sure like
getting up on the cross.

41:26.785 --> 41:29.821
(laughing):
Yeah?

41:29.855 --> 41:33.158
Yeah, you know, I haven't
seen this thing in years?

41:33.191 --> 41:34.159
(chuckles)

41:34.192 --> 41:36.194
Floyd.

41:36.227 --> 41:38.830
- Why do you keep doing that?
- Doing what?

41:38.864 --> 41:41.299
Materializing
out of empty space.

41:41.332 --> 41:43.034
I cannot do that.

41:43.068 --> 41:45.036
However, there are contractors

41:45.070 --> 41:47.873
who have been developing
an incredible s...

41:49.007 --> 41:50.609
Sorry.

41:50.642 --> 41:52.878
Not really supposed
to talk about that.

41:52.911 --> 41:56.915
Uh, I just wanted to let you
know that Department 44

41:56.948 --> 41:59.551
really appreciated
your help on the Neox case.

41:59.585 --> 42:02.120
I convey to you the thanks
of a grateful nation.

42:02.153 --> 42:04.923
You speak on behalf
of the whole nation?

42:04.956 --> 42:07.893
A project
that wastes national resources

42:07.926 --> 42:09.895
damages national security.

42:09.928 --> 42:11.830
You know, Neox could have spent
billions more

42:11.863 --> 42:14.065
without solving the underlying
problems in its systems.

42:14.099 --> 42:16.935
Neox was backed
by Pentagon procurement

42:16.968 --> 42:20.338
and military officials
and a system built

42:20.371 --> 42:22.974
on denial and greed.

42:24.275 --> 42:27.078
And they would have gotten
away with it, too,

42:27.112 --> 42:29.848
if it weren't
for you meddling kids.
