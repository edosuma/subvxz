YOUR LITTLE GAME OF--

00:27.200 --> 00:27.934
ACTUALLY, I DON'T MIND

00:27.934 --> 00:30.000
INTERRUPTING
YOUR LITTLE GAME.
COME HERE.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.600
I NEED YOUR SIGNATURES
ON THIS CONTRACT.

00:33.600 --> 00:34.400
WHAT'S IT FOR?

00:34.400 --> 00:36.000
OH, JUST A LITTLE
DOCUMENT I'VE DRAWN UP,

00:36.000 --> 00:39.767
SPECIFYING THAT YOU
WON'T DISTURB OUR
V.I.P. GUESTS THIS WEEK,

00:39.767 --> 00:44.667
WHICH INCLUDES
"NO FOOTBALL
IN THE LOBBY."

00:44.667 --> 00:47.400
I CALL IT
A PRE-RESTRAINING ORDER.

00:47.400 --> 00:48.734
I OBJECT.

00:48.734 --> 00:50.700
OVERRULED.

00:50.700 --> 00:52.667
MR. MOSEBY.

00:52.667 --> 00:57.600
AH. MR. BABALABALOO.

00:57.834 --> 01:01.000
EVERYTHING IS IN PLACE
FOR THE ROYAL VISIT.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
INITIAL HERE,
HERE, AND HERE.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.867
REST ASSURED, THE PRINCE'S
STAY WILL BE RELAXING
AND TRANQUIL.

01:06.867 --> 01:09.600
[SCREAMS] I JUST SAW
A FLYING SAUCER.

01:09.600 --> 01:12.700
WITH ENTERTAINMENT
IN THE LOBBY

01:12.700 --> 01:14.300
EVERY HALF HOUR.

01:15.700 --> 01:16.967
WAIT.
YOU SAW ALIENS?

01:16.967 --> 01:20.500
SHE PROBABLY JUST
SAW HERSELF IN THE MIRROR.

01:22.500 --> 01:23.567
I WAS OUT ON MY BALCONY,

01:23.567 --> 01:26.700
AND I SAW SOMETHING
ROUND AND SHINY IN THE SKY.

01:26.700 --> 01:28.500
THAT'S CALLED THE MOON.

01:28.500 --> 01:31.934
I KNOW THAT. AND DURING
THE DAY, IT'S CALLED THE SUN.

01:31.934 --> 01:35.000
NOW, EXCUSE ME.
MY MASK IS HARDENING.

01:38.967 --> 01:39.767
DECENT THROW.

01:39.767 --> 01:42.500
THANK YOU.
I HAVE NEVER THROWN
ONE OF THESE,

01:42.500 --> 01:44.767
BUT I AM
WATCHING IT ON TV.

01:44.767 --> 01:46.100
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

01:46.100 --> 01:47.700
SANJEI. AND YOU ARE?

01:47.700 --> 01:49.100
I'M ZACK
AND HE'S CODY.

01:49.100 --> 01:52.000
SO YOU TWO ARE BEING
BEANS IN A POD.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.600
I MEAN,
BEING IDENTICAL.

01:54.600 --> 01:57.300
YEAH, EXCEPT I'M FUNNIER,
BETTER-LOOKING,

01:57.300 --> 01:59.300
AND CHICKS DIG ME.

01:59.300 --> 02:02.367
WANNA GO HANG OUT?

02:02.767 --> 02:04.567
YES, I WOULD.

02:04.567 --> 02:05.200
COME ON, J.

02:05.200 --> 02:08.033
J.? IS THIS
BEING A NICKNAME?

02:08.033 --> 02:12.133
WELL, SOME PEOPLE
CALL ME JUNKYARD DOG.

02:12.133 --> 02:15.800
MOST PEOPLE CALL YOU
BLANKET-HUGGIN' GEEK.

02:15.800 --> 02:19.934
WELL, AFTER THAT,
THEY CALL ME JUNKYARD DOG.

GREAT CATCH.

03:12.900 --> 03:14.734
UNH.

03:14.734 --> 03:16.500
Both: AY-YI-YI-YI!

03:16.500 --> 03:18.400
OOH, I AM LIKING
THAT ODD GESTURE.

03:18.400 --> 03:21.100
IN ISHKABAR, WE JUST BOW.

03:22.200 --> 03:24.000
ISHKABAR?
WHERE IS THAT?

03:24.000 --> 03:25.500
WELL, IF YOU PAID
ATTENTION IN CLASS,

03:25.500 --> 03:29.100
YOU'D KNOW
IT'S A SMALL ISLAND
BETWEEN INDIA AND THAILAND,

03:29.100 --> 03:31.233
AND ITS MAIN EXPORT
IS LIMA BEANS.

03:31.233 --> 03:34.467
WE'LL FORGIVE YOU
FOR THAT.

03:34.467 --> 03:35.867
OK.

03:35.867 --> 03:38.200
TIME FOR
THE EXTRA POINT.

03:38.200 --> 03:39.767
FIRST YOU CALL
THE ELEVATOR.

03:39.767 --> 03:43.467
THEN WHEN THE DOORS OPEN,
YOU HAVE TO KICK IT THROUGH

03:43.467 --> 03:46.500
BEFORE THEY CLOSE.

03:48.400 --> 03:51.367
AND THEN YOU RUN
FOR YOUR LIFE.

03:51.367 --> 03:52.367
HALT.

03:52.367 --> 03:54.834
ARE YOU FORGETTING
THE CONTRACT?

03:54.834 --> 03:56.200
I SAID NO FOOTBALL.

03:56.200 --> 04:00.066
YES. BUT IF
I MAY REFER YOU
TO PARAGRAPH 3,

04:00.066 --> 04:04.033
SUBSECTION D,
ROMAN NUMERAL V-I-I.

04:04.033 --> 04:07.300
YOU SAID
"NO FOOTBALL
IN THE LOBBY."

04:07.300 --> 04:11.834
LAST TIME I CHECKED,
THIS WAS A HALLWAY.

04:11.834 --> 04:12.767
HA HA HA.

04:12.767 --> 04:14.300
THERE YOU ARE.

04:14.300 --> 04:17.934
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING
EVERYWHERE FOR YOU,
YOUR HIGHNESS.

04:17.934 --> 04:19.467
YOU'RE THE PRINCE?

04:19.467 --> 04:21.300
YES. THE HEIR
TO THE THRONE OF ISHKABAR.

04:21.300 --> 04:23.500
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US
YOU WERE THE PRINCE?

04:23.500 --> 04:27.500
I AM NOT WORTHY.
I AM NOT WORTHY.
I AM NOT WORTHY.

04:27.500 --> 04:28.567
THAT IS WHY.

04:28.567 --> 04:30.700
YOUR HIGHNESS,
PLEASE FORGIVE ME

04:30.700 --> 04:33.000
IF YOU WERE BOTHERED
BY THESE TWO HOOLIGANS.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.367
THESE ARE MY FRIENDS.

04:34.367 --> 04:37.734
TOMORROW THEY
HAVE INVITED ME
TO THE INDOOR BAZAAR.

04:37.734 --> 04:38.200
YOU MEAN MALL?

04:38.200 --> 04:42.500
ACTUALLY, JIM'S
JERKY JOINT IS FEATURING
A NEW MYSTERY MEAT.

04:42.500 --> 04:44.367
IT IS BIZARRE.

04:44.367 --> 04:47.567
COME, YOUR HIGHNESS.
YOU ARE LATE FOR YOUR
DIPLOMACY LESSON.

04:47.567 --> 04:50.500
CAN'T I DO IT TOMORROW?
I NEED A BREAK.

04:50.500 --> 04:52.033
NO. TOMORROW YOU'RE
MEETING WITH THE MAYOR

04:52.033 --> 04:55.100
AND ADDRESSING THE ENTIRE
ISHKABARIAN COMMUNITY.

04:55.100 --> 04:58.800
FORTUNATELY, THEY BOTH
HAVE THE DAY OFF.

05:00.400 --> 05:04.900
London: MADDIE, CHECK IT OUT.
I MADE A SIGN FOR THE ALIENS.

05:06.500 --> 05:09.100
WELL, WHAT IF THEY
DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH?

05:09.100 --> 05:10.734
GOT IT COVERED.

05:12.500 --> 05:13.400
<i>"HOLA </i>ALIENS"?

05:13.400 --> 05:17.000
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU DON'T NEED ME. <i>ADIOS. </i>

05:17.500 --> 05:18.967
OK. BUT YOU'RE
GONNA MISS IT

05:18.967 --> 05:22.600
WHEN I GET
THE FIRST VIDEO
OF AN ALIEN SPACESHIP.

05:22.600 --> 05:24.000
YEAH, YOU'RE GONNA
MISS IT, TOO,

05:24.000 --> 05:27.500
UNLESS YOU TAKE
THE LENS CAP OFF.

05:28.400 --> 05:29.233
LOOK, I GOT TO GO.

05:29.233 --> 05:30.900
WE'RE DEFROSTING THE FREEZER
AT MY HOUSE TONIGHT,

05:30.900 --> 05:34.467
AND IF I DON'T HURRY,
GRANDMA'S GONNA GRAB
MY FROZEN FISH STICK.

05:34.467 --> 05:37.667
FINE. I'LL JUST CANCEL
THE LOBSTER DINNER.

05:37.667 --> 05:40.367
LOBSTER?

05:40.367 --> 05:41.200
YEAH.

05:41.200 --> 05:42.867
IS IT...FRESH?

05:42.867 --> 05:47.300
IT STILL THINKS
IT HAS PLANS THIS WEEKEND.

05:47.300 --> 05:50.700
WELL, MAYBE I COULD HELP YOU
AND LOOK FOR ALIENS,

05:50.700 --> 05:51.867
AT LEAST THROUGH DINNER.

05:51.867 --> 05:55.000
AND IF THEY
HAVEN'T ARRIVED YET,
MAYBE THROUGH DESSERT.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.600
SAY, CREME BRULE?

05:57.600 --> 06:00.300
OK. CREME BRULE.

06:00.300 --> 06:03.367
JUST SAY IT TO ROOM SERVICE.

06:05.200 --> 06:07.100
OHM.

06:07.100 --> 06:09.200
OHM.

06:09.200 --> 06:12.033
OHM.

06:12.033 --> 06:14.834
KNOCK IT OFF.

06:14.834 --> 06:16.667
OK.

06:17.867 --> 06:21.600
MOM, ZACK'S
TOUCHING MY AURA.

06:22.300 --> 06:23.367
NICE TURBAN.

06:23.367 --> 06:25.700
YOU HANG AROUND
WITH SANJEI AGAIN TODAY?

06:25.700 --> 06:29.367
YEAH, UNTIL THAT BABALOO
GUY MADE J. STOP PLAYING.

06:29.367 --> 06:31.834
JUST BECAUSE HE HAD
TO PASS A FEW LAWS.

06:31.834 --> 06:34.700
THAT BABAGANUSH GUY
IS SO BOSSY.

06:34.700 --> 06:35.734
"DO THIS. DO THAT."

06:35.734 --> 06:40.100
"GO HERE. GO THERE."
HE'S WORSE THAN A MOTHER.

06:40.834 --> 06:43.667
I CONSIDER YOU
MORE OF A FRIEND.

06:43.667 --> 06:44.400
OH, GOOD.

06:44.400 --> 06:47.834
'CAUSE FRIENDS
DON'T HAVE TO GIVE
FRIENDS ALLOWANCES.

06:47.834 --> 06:50.133
SEE YOU AFTER MY SHOW.
LOVE YOU.

06:50.133 --> 06:51.567
Both: LOVE YOU.

06:51.567 --> 06:52.500
I'M GOING TO MEDITATE.

06:52.500 --> 06:54.400
CAN YOU HURRY UP AND
FIND YOUR INNER PEACE?

06:54.400 --> 06:57.100
I WANNA HAVE A BREAD FIGHT.
AND I WANNA MEDITATE.

06:57.100 --> 07:00.867
J. DOES IT, AND THAT'S HOW
HE STAYS SO CALM AND SERENE.

07:00.867 --> 07:02.100
I CANNOT TAKE THIS!
I CANNOT!

07:02.100 --> 07:04.834
BY THE DUST OF KORISH,
I'VE HAD ENOUGH!

07:04.834 --> 07:07.467
YEAH, HE'S BLISS
ON A STICK.

07:07.467 --> 07:09.367
I'M SICK
OF DOING MY DUTY

07:09.367 --> 07:11.500
AND ALWAYS BEING TOLD
WHAT TO DO.

07:11.500 --> 07:14.233
THE SACRED TURBAN
IS NEVER TO TOUCH
THE GROUND.

07:14.233 --> 07:16.767
YOU'RE ALSO NOT
SUPPOSED TO DO THIS.

07:20.467 --> 07:23.467
FORGIVE HIM,
GREAT KANISH.

07:23.467 --> 07:25.600
HE'S LOST HIS LENTILS.

07:25.600 --> 07:27.667
I WANT TO STAY HERE WITH YOU
AND BE REGULAR KID.

07:27.667 --> 07:30.900
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO BE GETTING THE KEY
TO THE CITY TOMORROW?

07:30.900 --> 07:33.800
I DON'T CARE.
I WANT TO BE A NORMAL BOY.

07:33.800 --> 07:35.934
IT'S NOT AS MUCH FUN
AS BEING IN A PALACE.

07:35.934 --> 07:40.400
WHAT GOOD IS A PALACE
WHEN YOU'RE A PRISONER
INSIDE OF IT?

07:40.400 --> 07:42.100
OK, I'VE GOT A PLAN.
YES.

07:42.100 --> 07:46.500
THAT'S WHAT HE ALWAYS
SAYS RIGHT BEFORE
WE GET GROUNDED.

07:46.500 --> 07:47.734
NO. THIS PLAN
IS SUREFIRE.

07:47.734 --> 07:53.000
CORRECTION. THAT'S WHAT
HE ALWAYS SAYS RIGHT BEFORE
WE GET GROUNDED.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.867
HERE'S HOW
IT'S GONNA WORK.

07:54.867 --> 07:59.233
ONE OF US WILL
TAKE SANJEI'S PLACE
AT THE CEREMONY TOMORROW.

07:59.233 --> 07:59.867
BRILLIANT.

07:59.867 --> 08:03.600
EXCEPT HE LOOKS
NOTHING LIKE US.

08:03.600 --> 08:05.800
HIS PLANS ONLY
WORK FOR TWINS.

08:05.800 --> 08:08.367
THEN WHY DON'T YOU COME UP
WITH SOMETHING BETTER?

08:08.367 --> 08:10.133
I'VE GOT IT.
AT FORMAL CEREMONIES,

08:10.133 --> 08:12.600
DON'T YOU WEAR
THE TRADITIONAL
SHABAKABABA?

08:12.600 --> 08:16.233
YES. CODY, YOU'RE
BEING A GENIUS.

08:16.233 --> 08:17.767
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
TALKING ABOUT?

08:17.767 --> 08:22.400
WHY DO YOU EVEN BOTHER
TO GO TO SCHOOL?

08:22.400 --> 08:26.467
A SHABAKABABA IS YOUR
TRADITIONAL HEADDRESS
WHICH COVERS THE FACE.

08:26.467 --> 08:29.867
OH. SO WHEN YOU AND I GO
TO THE MALL AND HAVE FUN,

08:29.867 --> 08:31.467
CODY WILL PRETEND
TO BE YOU.

08:31.467 --> 08:34.767
EXACTLY. WHICH
MAKES ME THE PRINCE.

08:34.767 --> 08:36.834
OOH, THIS WILL BE
VERY EXCITING.

08:36.834 --> 08:38.867
TOMORROW I WILL BE
LIVING THE SUITE LIFE

08:38.867 --> 08:42.400
OF ZACK AND CODY
AND SANJEI.

08:42.400 --> 08:45.767
All: HUH-HUH-
AY-YI-YI-YI-YI!

08:49.500 --> 08:51.600
THE MAYOR IS WAITING
FOR US DOWNSTAIRS.

08:51.600 --> 08:54.500
YES, AND THANK YOU AGAIN
FOR HONORING MY HOTEL

08:54.500 --> 08:57.300
BY ALLOWING US
TO HOLD THE CEREMONY HERE.

08:57.300 --> 08:59.900
OH, MR. MOSEBY,
QUICK QUESTION.

08:59.900 --> 09:01.000
NOT NOW, ZACK.

09:01.000 --> 09:01.967
SEE, IF YOU HADN'T

09:01.967 --> 09:03.800
TAKEN THE TIME
TO SAY "NOT NOW, ZACK,"

09:03.800 --> 09:04.667
I WOULD'VE BEEN FINISHED.

09:04.667 --> 09:09.300
BUT NOW HERE WE ARE AT
THE BEGINNING OF MY QUESTION.

09:10.033 --> 09:12.600
VERY WELL.
WHAT IS IT?

09:12.600 --> 09:13.500
IN THE CONTRACT,

09:13.500 --> 09:15.767
ARE CODY AND I
THE PARTY OF THE FIRST PART

09:15.767 --> 09:17.667
OR THE PARTY
OF THE SECOND PART?

09:17.667 --> 09:19.967
AND WHICH PARTY
IS NOT ALLOWED TO PARTY?

09:19.967 --> 09:22.967
I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THIS.

09:22.967 --> 09:23.967
OW! PAPER CUT.

09:23.967 --> 09:26.500
OW! OW! I'M BLEEDING OUT.

09:26.500 --> 09:30.200
REMEMBER, ALL YOU HAVE
TO DO IS SIT THERE
AND SAY, "THANK YOU.

09:30.200 --> 09:33.300
I LOVE BOSTON.
GO RED SOX."

09:33.300 --> 09:33.767
NO PROBLEM.

09:33.767 --> 09:38.100
BUT I'M STILL
SHORTER THAN YOU
EVEN IN MY MOM'S HIGH HEELS.

09:39.667 --> 09:40.667
I DON'T
SEE ANYTHING.

09:40.667 --> 09:44.934
WELL, YOU CAN'T SEE
A BROKEN HEART EITHER,
BUT IT HURTS.

09:44.934 --> 09:47.300
KISS IT, MR. MOSEBY?

09:47.867 --> 09:49.600
ALL BETTER.

09:59.967 --> 10:01.233
YOU'RE THE BEST, SARAH.

10:01.233 --> 10:05.000
I CAN SEE MYSELF
IN MY TOENAILS.

10:05.400 --> 10:08.934
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE STAYED UP ALL NIGHT
AND DIDN'T SEE ANY ALIENS.

10:08.934 --> 10:13.600
THEY PROBABLY DIDN'T COME
BECAUSE THEY SENSE
YOU'RE A NONBELIEVER.

10:13.600 --> 10:14.500
YOU'RE RIGHT.

10:14.500 --> 10:18.600
I'LL SEND OUT AN "I BELIEVE
IN ALIENS" VIBE TONIGHT.

10:18.600 --> 10:21.867
THANKS, SARAH.
GIVE YOURSELF A NICE TIP.

20:29.300 --> 20:31.400
AND MY DUTY STINKS.

20:31.734 --> 20:34.200
WHAT HE'S TRYING
TO SAY IS...

20:34.200 --> 20:36.467
HE JUST WANTED TO BE
A REGULAR KID.

20:36.467 --> 20:37.767
YOU TWO STAY OUT OF THIS.

20:37.767 --> 20:40.300
NOW PRINCE SANJEI KNOWS
THAT BEING A PRINCE

20:40.300 --> 20:42.200
IS A SERIOUS OBLIGATION,

20:42.200 --> 20:43.867
AND THERE IS
NO TIME FOR FUN.

20:43.867 --> 20:46.200
HEY, HE'S JUST A KID.

20:46.200 --> 20:47.000
LOOK, MR. BABALOO.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.767
BABALABALOO.
BABALABALOO.

20:49.767 --> 20:51.600
WHATEVER.

20:51.600 --> 20:53.800
I MAY NOT KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT ROYALTY,

20:53.800 --> 20:55.200
BUT I DO KNOW ABOUT KIDS,

20:55.200 --> 20:56.400
AND THEY NEED BALANCE
IN THEIR LIVES.

20:56.400 --> 20:58.934
THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE DEPRIVING SANJEI OF.

20:58.934 --> 20:59.767
SILENCE.

20:59.767 --> 21:00.967
NO. YOU BE SILENT.

21:00.967 --> 21:01.700
BUT PRINCE...

21:01.700 --> 21:03.900
THE PRINCE
IS SPEAKING.

21:03.900 --> 21:05.000
YOU TELL HIM, J.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.934
I KNOW I MUST FULFILL
ALL OF MY DUTIES.

21:07.934 --> 21:08.500
BUT IN THE FUTURE,

21:08.500 --> 21:12.967
I WANT YOU TO BE
SCHEDULING MORE TIME
FOR FUN

21:12.967 --> 21:14.300
AND LESS FOR
UNPLEASANT THINGS.

21:14.300 --> 21:18.834
YEAH, THAT PRESS CONFERENCE
WAS LIKE DETENTION
WITH CAMERAS,

21:18.834 --> 21:20.667
AND I HAVE
A BUNION ON MY FOOT

21:20.667 --> 21:22.967
THE SIZE OF A FOOTBALL.

21:23.600 --> 21:26.300
AND TO KICK OFF
OUR POLICY OF FUN,

21:26.300 --> 21:28.734
WE WILL BE GOING
TO THE AMUSEMENT PARK
TOMORROW

21:28.734 --> 21:31.934
AND RIDING
THE ROLLER COASTER
UNTIL WE PUKE.

21:31.934 --> 21:32.500
BUT YOUR HIGHNESS--

21:32.500 --> 21:34.300
AND IF YOU'RE HAVING
ANY PROBLEM WITH THAT,

21:34.300 --> 21:37.667
YOU MAY TAKE IT UP WITH
MY NEW MINISTER OF DEFENSE,

21:37.667 --> 21:39.700
THE QUEEN OF SHEBA.

21:39.700 --> 21:41.500
ME? OH.

21:41.500 --> 21:44.233
YOU CAN CALL ME DELILAH,

21:44.233 --> 21:46.133
YOUR MAJESTY.
BUT...

21:46.133 --> 21:50.667
DON'T BUT ME,
'CAUSE I'LL BUT BACK.

21:50.667 --> 21:52.767
I WILL MAKE
THE ARRANGEMENTS.

21:52.767 --> 21:56.400
ALL RIGHT! WE'RE GOING
TO THE AMUSEMENT PARK!

21:56.400 --> 21:57.700
HO, NOT SO FAST.

21:57.700 --> 21:58.867
YOU TWO ARE
IN BIG TROUBLE.

21:58.867 --> 22:03.100
IMPERSONATING A PRINCE
IN MY NEW HIGH HEELS?

22:03.100 --> 22:05.767
NOT TO MENTION
YOUR HIGH JINKS
EMBARRASSED MY HOTEL

22:05.767 --> 22:08.033
WHICH IS
A CLEAR VIOLATION
OF OUR CONTRACT.

22:08.033 --> 22:11.000
OOH, LET'S LOOK
AT THE PUNISHMENT
CLAUSE.

22:11.000 --> 22:11.967
MR. MOSEBY.

22:11.967 --> 22:13.033
IF YOU SHOW MERCY,

22:13.033 --> 22:14.300
I WILL RECOMMEND THE TIPTON

22:14.300 --> 22:15.934
TO ALL OF MY ROYAL FRIENDS.

22:15.934 --> 22:20.000
WELL,
HAVE A COTTON CANDY
FOR ME, BOYS.

22:20.000 --> 22:20.700
[LAUGHS]

22:20.700 --> 22:25.300
All: HUH, HUH,
AI-YI-YI-YI-YI!
