WEBVTT

00:00.403 --> 00:02.472
This bookshop rules. I get it...

00:02.483 --> 00:04.413
- Paper, not screens.
- Yeah.

00:04.414 --> 00:07.585
Oof, I can't stop thinking about
this prix-fixe pasta tasting

00:07.586 --> 00:09.102
- at Dobby tonight.
- Wait a second.

00:09.103 --> 00:10.827
You're going to Dobby tonight?

00:10.828 --> 00:13.068
- Girl, yah.
- Dude, you didn't tell me that.

00:13.069 --> 00:15.413
I saw that chef on "Chef's
Table." She's incredible.

00:15.414 --> 00:16.999
I love a restaurant run by women

00:17.000 --> 00:18.703
'cause they don't rape
or molest their employees,

00:18.714 --> 00:20.263
- and the food just tastes better.
- Yeah.

00:20.274 --> 00:22.263
Also, I told them already
that you don't eat beef.

00:22.274 --> 00:23.447
Why?

00:23.448 --> 00:25.585
So there's no beef on your plate?

00:25.586 --> 00:27.240
Ilana, I'm not coming

00:27.241 --> 00:29.240
to your one-year
anniversary dinner tonight.

00:29.241 --> 00:31.137
Don't be a bitch. Who's gonna mediate?

00:31.138 --> 00:33.930
Right, it's the
anniversary/renegotiation

00:33.941 --> 00:35.749
relationship-check-in.

00:35.760 --> 00:38.290
Dude, this is big. Do you have
all your deal points prepared?

00:38.301 --> 00:40.404
You Sade-Baderinwa believe I do!

00:40.415 --> 00:41.586
Dope.

00:41.587 --> 00:43.517
There they are.

00:46.940 --> 00:48.318
That's good placement.

00:48.319 --> 00:49.560
Wow.

00:49.561 --> 00:51.215
Gor-gous!

00:53.423 --> 00:56.008
You took the lemons of being
fired from Anthropologie

00:56.009 --> 00:57.629
and turned them into gorgeous, artistic,

00:57.630 --> 00:59.663
bad-bitch-gettin'-shit-done lemonade.

00:59.664 --> 01:01.569
Yeah, I mean, thank God
those cards are in here.

01:01.580 --> 01:03.905
I'm exhausted from working
on my art all day

01:03.906 --> 01:06.792
and catering every night. I needed this.

01:07.630 --> 01:09.870
Abbi Abrams.

01:09.871 --> 01:12.801
Donna? My God. I haven't
seen you since college, dude.

01:12.802 --> 01:15.077
- Hi!
- Hi!

01:15.078 --> 01:16.664
- Wait. Is this...
- So good to see you!

01:16.675 --> 01:17.843
- You, too.
- Smelly Pussy Donna?

01:17.854 --> 01:19.092
Ilana.

01:19.975 --> 01:21.663
I am s... I am so sorry.

01:21.664 --> 01:23.318
I'm truly sorry. That is so rude.

01:23.319 --> 01:25.180
I am... I am so sorry.

01:25.181 --> 01:27.594
Clearly that got relayed from me.

01:27.595 --> 01:29.111
This is my best friend, Ilana.

01:29.112 --> 01:30.836
And she didn't mean
to say that out loud.

01:30.837 --> 01:33.491
It's okay. I officially own
that nickname,

01:33.492 --> 01:35.456
because I beat my smelly pussy.

01:35.457 --> 01:38.043
It only took probiotics
and six years of therapy,

01:38.044 --> 01:42.010
but I'm officially free
of malodorous pudenda.

01:42.021 --> 01:43.335
- That's amazing.
- Smelly pussy.

01:43.346 --> 01:44.525
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:44.526 --> 01:47.249
I've actually used my horrible
story to inspire other women.

01:47.250 --> 01:49.180
I just gave a TAD Talk.

01:49.181 --> 01:50.525
You gave a TED Talk about it?

01:50.526 --> 01:52.146
No, TADTalk.

01:52.147 --> 01:53.836
Cool.

01:53.837 --> 01:56.077
What are you up to?
Are you still doing your art?

01:56.078 --> 01:58.111
I really loved her art.
She was so talented.

01:58.112 --> 02:00.594
Thanks so much.
I... Yeah, I mean, I'm trying.

02:00.595 --> 02:02.870
She's not trying. She is succeeding.

02:02.871 --> 02:05.663
She's selling her cards
in the store right now!

02:05.664 --> 02:10.318
Okay, these are literally so cute.

02:10.318 --> 02:11.905
I just had the best idea.

02:11.906 --> 02:13.491
I'm a coordinator at MoMA.

02:13.492 --> 02:14.919
Cool? That's amazing.

02:14.930 --> 02:16.697
And we're having
an incredible party tonight.

02:16.708 --> 02:19.318
Would you guys please come
as my close personal guests?

02:19.319 --> 02:21.387
I have this dinner I have to go to.

02:21.388 --> 02:23.077
That sucks we can't go.

02:24.147 --> 02:27.870
Well, I mean...

02:27.871 --> 02:31.353
Icould still go, like, alone.

02:31.354 --> 02:33.249
Whoa.

02:33.250 --> 02:35.044
I guess you could.

02:37.451 --> 02:40.008
Okay, so you're gonna go. Great.
Yeah, I've put you on the list,

02:40.009 --> 02:42.249
and they are excited to meet you.

02:42.250 --> 02:43.698
My gosh.

02:43.699 --> 02:46.119
My Pediphile is here.

02:46.733 --> 02:47.836
What, now?

02:47.837 --> 02:50.249
Pediphile is an app

02:50.250 --> 02:52.011
for people who are obsessed
with pedicabs.

02:52.022 --> 02:53.594
I became obsessed with them in college

02:53.595 --> 02:56.491
when I needed to air out
my vagina, because...

02:56.492 --> 02:57.939
the smelly pussy thing.

02:57.940 --> 02:59.491
Also, it's so convenient to get around.

02:59.492 --> 03:01.177
You guys should think
about getting the app.

03:01.188 --> 03:02.629
I am a co-founder. Full-disclosure.

03:02.630 --> 03:05.594
- All right, I'll see you tonight, Donna.
- Don't forget to dress sexy!

03:05.595 --> 03:07.986
I got to see this bitch
get into a pedicab.

03:08.595 --> 03:10.978
- Wow.
- Wow.

03:12.267 --> 03:13.991
See you tonight!

03:15.216 --> 03:17.284
Smelly Pussy Donna.

03:17.285 --> 03:20.560
I wouldn't notair my pussy out
in a pedicab.

03:20.561 --> 03:21.974
Yeah. Me, neither.

03:28.940 --> 03:30.456
Dude, tonight is so cool.

03:30.457 --> 03:32.223
A party at MoMA? Come on!

03:32.234 --> 03:34.201
Yeah, I mean, I have to cancel
my catering shift,

03:34.212 --> 03:35.633
but MoMA's, like, so worth it.

03:35.644 --> 03:36.685
So worth it.

03:36.696 --> 03:38.260
I'm a little nervous about going alone.

03:38.271 --> 03:39.974
No, you'll have Smelly Pussy Donna...

03:39.975 --> 03:41.732
- Donna. You'll have Donna.
- I mean, I could also ask,

03:41.733 --> 03:43.249
like, another one of my friends.

03:43.250 --> 03:44.905
Yeah!

03:44.906 --> 03:48.043
Like...

03:48.044 --> 03:49.560
I could ask the...

03:49.561 --> 03:51.974
No, I...

03:51.975 --> 03:53.491
You know what? It's cool to go alone.

03:53.492 --> 03:55.146
It iscool, 'cause then
I don't have to explain

03:55.147 --> 03:57.995
all the art-world ins and outs
to someone. Like, it's a lot.

03:58.006 --> 03:59.455
You know what? I'm gonna call Kevin.

03:59.466 --> 04:00.735
Perfect. I'm gonna pet this dog.

04:00.746 --> 04:02.180
- Okay. Great.
- Hi!

04:02.181 --> 04:04.767
Hello! Hi!

04:06.595 --> 04:07.905
Hey! Kevin.

04:07.906 --> 04:09.698
- Who is this?
- It's Abbi?

04:09.699 --> 04:13.180
So, listen, this kind of, like,
really-big-deal thing

04:13.181 --> 04:15.075
came up tonight, art-wise,
and I was wondering

04:15.086 --> 04:17.974
if maybe someone could cover my shift?

04:17.975 --> 04:19.456
Fuck!

04:19.457 --> 04:21.284
Tonight is already gonna
be really intense,

04:21.285 --> 04:23.560
and it's too late to find
someone to cover you.

04:23.561 --> 04:26.077
But I guess we'll just have
to make do without you.

04:26.078 --> 04:27.801
Yes! Okay. Thank you so much, Kevin.

04:27.802 --> 04:30.284
- I owe you one.
- You go for it, girl.

04:30.285 --> 04:31.974
Okay.

04:31.975 --> 04:34.836
Hot and heavy over here,
Does Lincoln know?

04:34.837 --> 04:37.525
Well, I did have a polyamory
clause in my deal tonight,

04:37.526 --> 04:39.699
but now I have to add
a bestiality clause.

04:41.906 --> 04:43.594
- I thought it was funny.
- Thank you.

04:47.526 --> 04:50.767
Happy anniversary/
renegotiation/check-in.

04:50.768 --> 04:52.698
Yaas!

04:52.699 --> 04:55.077
All right. All right.

04:55.078 --> 04:57.560
Look at that wrapping.

04:57.561 --> 05:00.284
That's for you. That's part of it.

05:00.285 --> 05:02.215
- What is this?
- It is your very own

05:02.216 --> 05:04.249
handmade Experience Coupon Book.

05:04.250 --> 05:05.939
Okay.

05:05.940 --> 05:07.491
- "Handjob."
- Whoop!

05:07.492 --> 05:09.284
"Dry"?

05:09.285 --> 05:11.422
I prefer wet.

05:11.423 --> 05:13.594
Picnic in the park.

05:13.595 --> 05:15.939
Blowjob, wet.

05:15.940 --> 05:18.043
Zoo day.

05:18.044 --> 05:19.767
Anal!

05:19.768 --> 05:22.215
This is awesome. This is a quantified,

05:22.216 --> 05:24.801
organized list
of the stuff we already do.

05:24.802 --> 05:28.249
- I love it. Thank you.
- Yay!

05:28.250 --> 05:30.215
All right. My turn.

05:30.216 --> 05:33.939
Okay. Okay.

05:35.000 --> 05:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:47.906 --> 05:50.043
I mean

05:50.044 --> 05:52.767
I farted, and it went, like,
up my dress and up my nose,

05:52.768 --> 05:55.249
and then it dissipated...

05:55.250 --> 05:57.318
Okay. "Jewess"? Yes!

05:57.319 --> 05:59.387
I saw them, and I thought of you.

05:59.388 --> 06:01.284
Why?

06:01.285 --> 06:02.491
Just kidding.

06:11.768 --> 06:14.870
Art.

06:14.871 --> 06:18.249
Asymmetrical hairstyles.

06:18.250 --> 06:19.698
Unabashed confidence.

06:20.768 --> 06:23.629
Helicopter!

06:23.630 --> 06:24.939
Abbi!

06:24.940 --> 06:26.836
Kevin!

06:26.837 --> 06:28.491
Thank God you came after all.

06:28.492 --> 06:31.043
I was actually going to fire you
for bailing tonight,

06:31.044 --> 06:33.353
but here you are,
in your bizarrely gorgeous

06:33.354 --> 06:34.422
catering ware.

06:34.423 --> 06:35.919
Here I am!

06:35.930 --> 06:38.262
We've got asparagus spears
that still need to be trayed up,

06:38.273 --> 06:40.791
and then you can grab a tray of
riblets and start passing them.

06:40.802 --> 06:41.929
Did you bring your beret?

06:41.940 --> 06:44.008
I-I forgot the beret.

06:44.009 --> 06:45.537
It's okay. Just meet me in the garden.

06:45.548 --> 06:47.272
I brought an extra one!

06:49.588 --> 06:52.897
This is our first pasta tasting,
the bucatini tartufo.

06:52.908 --> 06:54.390
Mushrooms were milled in Hudson,

06:54.391 --> 06:56.045
and they were foraged just this morning.

06:56.046 --> 06:57.700
Nice.

06:57.701 --> 07:00.010
- Gorgeous.
- One down.

07:00.011 --> 07:02.183
11 to go. Let's enjoy this food

07:02.184 --> 07:03.838
before we get down to business.

07:03.839 --> 07:06.873
I agree. See, we are already
wonderful at negotiating.

07:06.874 --> 07:09.459
Yeah.

07:09.460 --> 07:10.873
My God.

07:10.874 --> 07:12.838
- God damn.
- I'm, like, literally, like,

07:12.839 --> 07:14.942
getting, like, buttery wet like the...

07:14.943 --> 07:16.838
- Yeah.
- Like the noodles.

07:16.839 --> 07:18.114
I would raw-dog this pasta

07:18.115 --> 07:20.873
even if I knew it had a disease.

07:20.874 --> 07:22.148
I'm a gassy bitch.

07:22.149 --> 07:24.769
I eat shtinky food! Whoo!

07:28.356 --> 07:31.114
Garlic rosemary lamb riblets
with a mint compote?

07:33.632 --> 07:35.045
Ab!

07:35.046 --> 07:37.148
- Abbi! Hi!
- Dude, what's up?

07:37.149 --> 07:39.700
I'm so sorry.

07:39.701 --> 07:41.148
Hey!

07:41.149 --> 07:42.459
Mwah! Mwah!

07:42.460 --> 07:43.700
Thanks so much for coming.

07:43.701 --> 07:44.873
It means so much to me.

07:44.874 --> 07:46.217
No, thank you for inviting me.

07:46.218 --> 07:47.631
- Of course.
- This is awesome.

07:47.632 --> 07:49.459
God.

07:49.460 --> 07:50.735
What?

07:50.736 --> 07:52.873
Jeffrey Sean Michael Thomas is here.

07:52.874 --> 07:55.942
He has nudes of me. Sick stuff.

07:55.943 --> 07:57.114
Let's go play nice.

07:57.115 --> 07:58.321
O-Okay.

07:58.322 --> 07:59.666
Hello!

07:59.667 --> 08:00.735
Ding dong!

08:00.736 --> 08:02.183
Let me get in here.

08:02.184 --> 08:04.942
- Let me get in.
- And so I said,

08:04.943 --> 08:07.355
"What is this, Sotheby's?"

08:09.529 --> 08:11.735
My God! Can I borrow your phone?

08:11.736 --> 08:13.562
Excuse me.

08:13.563 --> 08:16.838
Garlic rosemary lamb riblet
with mint compote?

08:16.839 --> 08:18.079
Jesus.

08:18.080 --> 08:20.045
This is a spiritual experience.

08:20.046 --> 08:21.079
All right, Lincoln.

08:22.391 --> 08:23.391
Shall we?

08:23.392 --> 08:24.666
All right.

08:30.770 --> 08:33.078
As we look ahead at the upcoming year,

08:33.080 --> 08:36.597
I would like to discuss the deal
points regarding sexual exploration,

08:36.597 --> 08:39.251
starting with the roller-coaster idea.

08:39.253 --> 08:41.183
That's a no for me, dawg.

08:41.183 --> 08:42.759
Roller coasters are already scary enough

08:42.770 --> 08:44.183
without me having my dick out.

08:44.183 --> 08:45.631
Plus, there's pictures,

08:45.632 --> 08:47.597
and they project the pictures
at the end.

08:47.598 --> 08:48.804
Nobody should see that.

08:48.805 --> 08:51.217
I just think it would be thrilling.

08:51.218 --> 08:53.390
I can give you Ferris wheel.

08:53.391 --> 08:55.597
Deal! I like that better, actually.

08:55.598 --> 08:57.010
Up-and-down-vibes.

08:57.011 --> 09:00.223
I'd like to bring up the item
of rom-coms.

09:00.234 --> 09:02.279
Don't know where we're
gonna get on this, Lincoln.

09:02.290 --> 09:04.666
I want to watch four rom-coms a year.

09:04.667 --> 09:07.907
I object because they are
offensive to women.

09:07.908 --> 09:09.528
That is subjective.

09:09.529 --> 09:11.838
I gotta push back,
and I'll give you two.

09:11.839 --> 09:14.631
Three. No laughing at them.

09:14.632 --> 09:16.942
Only laughing withthem.

09:16.943 --> 09:18.631
Give you two laughing at them,

09:18.632 --> 09:22.252
and one laughing with them.

09:22.253 --> 09:23.838
Deal.

09:23.839 --> 09:25.148
Can I approach the bench?

09:25.149 --> 09:27.493
Yes, you can.

09:34.184 --> 09:37.114
Hi-i-i-i!

09:37.115 --> 09:38.597
- Hey.
- How are you?

09:38.598 --> 09:39.942
- Good.
- You smell good.

09:39.943 --> 09:41.286
Thank you.

09:41.287 --> 09:44.010
Hopper went to MICA, as well!

09:44.011 --> 09:46.321
Dope! So, Hopper, what do you do now?

09:46.322 --> 09:49.010
I work at a gallery uptown part-time,

09:49.011 --> 09:51.493
and I paint in my studio
as much as I can.

09:51.494 --> 09:53.907
I teach occasionally at Hunter
undergrad as a sub.

09:53.908 --> 09:55.321
I heard you had the best time

09:55.322 --> 09:57.355
at that residency program out West.

09:57.356 --> 09:59.355
- How was it?
- Yeah, it was great.

09:59.356 --> 10:02.459
It was a nice mix of studio time
and teaching.

10:02.460 --> 10:04.424
- It was really nice.
- Beautiful.

10:04.425 --> 10:06.321
Wow. That sounds better

10:06.322 --> 10:09.942
than... anything I've done
in the past eight years.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.976
I'm sure that's not true.

10:11.977 --> 10:13.744
No, it is.

10:13.755 --> 10:15.564
You know what?
I'm gonna send you some links

10:15.575 --> 10:17.631
- to some programs, okay?
- Awesome, yeah.

10:17.632 --> 10:20.976
And also, you are going
to mingle tonight, believe me.

10:20.977 --> 10:22.886
- Okay, I will. Yeah.
- Okay, you know who I'd like

10:22.897 --> 10:25.252
to mingle with, though?
Those canapés right behind you.

10:25.253 --> 10:27.769
- Sir? Excuse me. The food?
- My God.

10:27.770 --> 10:30.942
- Hi.
- I-I'm gonna tie my shoe!

10:30.943 --> 10:32.700
- Describe!
- Okay.

10:32.701 --> 10:35.631
Salmon and cucumber twist
with a dollop of crème fraîche.

10:35.632 --> 10:36.666
- Okay.
- And our salmon

10:36.667 --> 10:38.424
is cured with beetroot.

10:38.425 --> 10:40.769
If I start choking, do not resuscitate.

10:40.770 --> 10:43.148
This is how I want to go.

10:43.149 --> 10:45.631
Hysterical.

10:45.632 --> 10:47.804
Okay.

10:49.287 --> 10:52.286
My laces get tangled.

10:52.287 --> 10:54.355
Food! You know what? I'm gonna go...

10:54.356 --> 10:57.045
I'm gonna go find them.
'Cause that looks so good.

10:57.046 --> 10:59.735
I'm gonna go get me some of that.

10:59.736 --> 11:01.010
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

11:01.011 --> 11:02.562
My God. Shit.

11:02.563 --> 11:04.597
Such a character.

11:04.598 --> 11:07.390
Do you have any coke...

11:07.391 --> 11:09.528
I've always known
how to clear out a room.

11:09.529 --> 11:12.136
Okay, moving on with the proceedings.

11:12.147 --> 11:13.774
I would like to look
at the next article,

11:13.785 --> 11:17.493
which is a suspension
period in monogamy.

11:17.494 --> 11:20.045
If we are gonna do this
for another beautiful year,

11:20.046 --> 11:25.804
I would like to make out with five...

11:25.805 --> 11:27.217
ty... "fivety" people.

11:27.218 --> 11:28.252
50 people.

11:28.253 --> 11:29.528
Ilana.

11:29.529 --> 11:30.873
Two.

11:30.874 --> 11:32.976
And I have to know about them.

11:32.977 --> 11:35.976
Okay! Dope!

11:35.977 --> 11:37.528
I mean deal.

11:37.529 --> 11:40.355
Communication is dope.

11:40.356 --> 11:43.217
On the long-term front,

11:43.218 --> 11:45.700
I would like to bring up an issue

11:45.701 --> 11:49.183
with the state of Maryland.

11:49.184 --> 11:52.425
I think I'd like to move there.

11:55.046 --> 11:57.735
You just want to up and move

11:57.736 --> 11:59.493
to middle-of-nowhere Maryland?

11:59.494 --> 12:01.252
Well, I'm from there,

12:01.253 --> 12:03.079
so my whole family would be there.

12:03.080 --> 12:04.735
My brother's a dentist, also,

12:04.736 --> 12:06.769
and we've always wanted
to start our own practice,

12:06.770 --> 12:08.217
"The Tooth Factory."

12:08.218 --> 12:12.390
And there's lots of great schools there.

12:12.391 --> 12:14.079
Schools? So, w-w-what,

12:14.080 --> 12:17.286
like, cars drive around them
slower, and it's safer to walk?

12:17.287 --> 12:19.459
No. Schools are...

12:19.460 --> 12:22.873
for the children that I father

12:22.874 --> 12:24.460
to attend.

12:30.908 --> 12:33.942
Are we... Are we still
discussing thisyear?

12:33.943 --> 12:36.286
I don't really remember
reviewing this for my notes.

12:36.287 --> 12:39.286
Well, I guess while looking
at this year's points,

12:39.287 --> 12:42.700
I looked ahead at next year
and the year after that.

12:42.701 --> 12:44.114
Is this about the rom-coms?

12:44.115 --> 12:46.562
'Cause I'll watch one
every weekend, you know?

12:46.563 --> 12:48.183
And I'll just rip a bong

12:48.184 --> 12:50.838
and laugh really sincerely,
and I'll learn to love them.

12:50.839 --> 12:53.045
No, it's just that,
I want to buy a house.

12:53.046 --> 12:54.666
I've been looking on Zillow.

12:54.667 --> 12:57.217
Houses aren't even
that expensive in Maryland.

12:57.218 --> 13:00.148
And I want to have kids,

13:00.149 --> 13:01.873
and I want to get married.

13:01.874 --> 13:03.528
Lincoln, I'm only 27.

13:03.529 --> 13:05.183
What am I, a child bride?

13:05.184 --> 13:07.493
You know, I don't know
that I never want it.

13:07.494 --> 13:09.631
I just definitely
don't want it right now.

13:09.632 --> 13:11.631
I could commit to a kid

13:11.632 --> 13:14.943
when I'm like... 43.

13:17.063 --> 13:19.597
Lincoln, I just figured out
that I want to go back to school

13:19.598 --> 13:23.183
and focus on my wizness.

13:23.184 --> 13:26.217
I'm on a New York City timeline.

13:26.218 --> 13:28.286
Do you ever think
you'd change your mind?

13:34.149 --> 13:36.597
At this point,

13:36.598 --> 13:38.736
I can't move on this.

13:41.494 --> 13:45.114
I have no counter.

13:49.667 --> 13:52.183
I have no counter.

13:52.184 --> 13:56.356
Well, these points are
non-negotiable for me.

14:48.356 --> 14:51.079
Riblets!

14:56.563 --> 14:58.010
Riblets. Am I right?

15:11.080 --> 15:12.459
God. Watch it!

15:12.460 --> 15:14.942
S... I am sorry.

15:14.943 --> 15:16.666
Shit!

15:16.667 --> 15:18.010
I'm so sorry!

15:18.011 --> 15:19.838
- Abbi!
- Abbi?!

15:19.839 --> 15:21.942
- My God.
- I'm so sorry.

15:21.943 --> 15:24.355
I'm so sorry. We were short caterers,

15:24.356 --> 15:27.010
and Abbi's never really been
talented with the tray, so...

15:27.011 --> 15:29.459
I'm so sorry. Actually,
Abbi's an up-and-coming artist

15:29.460 --> 15:31.424
and my personal guest, not a caterer.

15:31.425 --> 15:34.321
Yes, she is.

15:34.322 --> 15:38.631
So, I-I'm... I-I'm actually catering,

15:38.632 --> 15:42.666
but I am... am also a-a guest.

15:42.667 --> 15:44.804
Okay, Ab, We're gonna need you

15:44.805 --> 15:47.700
to start loading some dirties
into a van, so...

15:47.701 --> 15:49.321
Totally. I will do that.

15:49.322 --> 15:51.079
- Liars aren't cool.
- No, I-I kn...

15:51.080 --> 15:53.551
I don't think they're cool, either.

15:53.562 --> 15:55.518
You know what?
I have to go find some canapés,

15:55.529 --> 15:57.448
- clear my mind.
- Donna, I can get you canapés.

15:57.459 --> 15:59.700
I can... I can g...
I have access to all of them.

16:02.391 --> 16:04.966
Don't worry about her.
She can get her own canapés.

16:05.529 --> 16:07.700
It's not that bad!
I don't even like this dress.

16:07.701 --> 16:08.873
It's too yellow.

16:08.874 --> 16:11.252
I am so sorry.

16:11.253 --> 16:14.838
This is not how
this was supposed to go down.

16:14.839 --> 16:17.045
I was so excited to be here
tonight as a guest

16:17.046 --> 16:19.873
with all these cool art people.

16:19.874 --> 16:23.183
I mean, I'm actually an artist, too.

16:23.184 --> 16:26.233
I'm just not, like, a... a real one.

16:26.244 --> 16:27.735
Well, you might not want to say that.

16:27.736 --> 16:30.079
But it's smart to have
a flexible service job

16:30.080 --> 16:31.873
so that you can make art.

16:31.874 --> 16:33.769
I waited tables for years.

16:33.770 --> 16:36.010
And I spilled on lots of people.

16:36.011 --> 16:37.976
In fact, half my pieces are inspired

16:37.977 --> 16:40.390
by people I've spilled on.

16:40.391 --> 16:42.390
Well, what are your pieces like?

16:42.391 --> 16:43.804
You might know my work.

16:43.805 --> 16:45.700
I'm Toy Harris.

16:50.563 --> 16:53.390
You're T... You're Toy Harris?

16:56.115 --> 16:57.907
Holy shit, dude.

16:57.908 --> 16:59.666
- My God.
- You're Toy Harris?

16:59.667 --> 17:01.631
- Yeah.
- You're the third floor.

17:01.632 --> 17:04.252
It took us years of protesting,
but we're here.

17:04.252 --> 17:05.286
- I cannot bel...
- It's okay.

17:05.287 --> 17:06.665
You... You... I c...

17:06.666 --> 17:09.047
So, you want to just... you know.

17:09.058 --> 17:11.114
I can't believe I spill...
I spilled on Toy Harris.

17:11.115 --> 17:13.045
I spilled on Toy Harris!

17:13.046 --> 17:14.942
- Okay.
- I am getting dizzy!

17:14.943 --> 17:16.424
- This is insane!
- All right, then.

17:16.425 --> 17:17.459
Good night.

17:17.460 --> 17:20.037
My God. Okay.

17:22.874 --> 17:25.011
This is not her night.

17:25.916 --> 17:27.398
Bah!

17:27.400 --> 17:29.088
Bee!

17:29.089 --> 17:30.330
Hee-hee-hoo!

17:30.331 --> 17:32.157
What do they do? Hoo-hoo-hee!

17:32.158 --> 17:35.399
Put your head out of the window
now for fresh air!

17:36.676 --> 17:39.847
Ay! Zy-yo-wah!

17:39.848 --> 17:42.054
Please keep your head
out of the window, okay?

17:42.055 --> 17:43.813
You keep your head
out of the window t...

17:46.641 --> 17:48.088
You keep your head out, too.

17:48.089 --> 17:51.469
Jesus Christ!

17:54.124 --> 17:56.675
Your blood pressure's low.

17:56.676 --> 18:00.399
You probably fainted from low
blood sugar and dehydration.

18:00.400 --> 18:03.054
Your girlfriend said
you narrowly missed fainting

18:03.055 --> 18:06.709
into something dangerous...
a sculpture, I think?

18:06.710 --> 18:08.330
Wait, is Ilana here?

18:08.331 --> 18:10.675
No, she's not my girlfriend.
People do talk, though.

18:10.676 --> 18:12.571
No, Donna?

18:12.572 --> 18:13.916
The woman who brought you in.

18:13.917 --> 18:16.571
Yeah, yeah, Smelly Pussy Do... Donna.

18:16.572 --> 18:18.813
No, Donna's just my friend.

18:18.814 --> 18:22.019
No, I-I don't have a, boyfriend or...

18:22.020 --> 18:23.985
ora-a girlfriend.

18:23.986 --> 18:27.364
That's... surprising.

18:27.365 --> 18:30.123
You just seem like you would.

18:30.124 --> 18:32.950
Thanks.

18:32.951 --> 18:34.916
No, you, too. You see... I mean,

18:34.917 --> 18:37.157
obviously, you have one...
You do. You're a doctor,

18:37.158 --> 18:40.640
- so of cour...
- I don't.

18:40.641 --> 18:42.537
Cool.

18:47.020 --> 18:49.192
Fart away, man.

18:51.055 --> 18:53.298
God, I'm full.

18:55.055 --> 18:58.537
You know, while I was,
breaking your toilet,

18:58.538 --> 19:02.261
I had a lot of time to think, and...

19:02.262 --> 19:04.330
I'm meant to be a polyamorous queen.

19:04.331 --> 19:05.744
I understand.

19:05.745 --> 19:08.468
You got too much love
for just one person.

19:08.469 --> 19:11.192
You are so special.

19:11.193 --> 19:13.261
Such a heart on you.

19:13.262 --> 19:16.054
You're gonna be
an amazing dad and husband.

19:16.055 --> 19:18.468
And you should have those things
if you want them.

19:18.469 --> 19:21.088
I just don't know that I do right now.

19:21.089 --> 19:23.088
You'll figure it out when it's right.

19:23.089 --> 19:25.364
Do you think I'll figure it out
like you,

19:25.365 --> 19:27.192
by the time I'm 40?

19:27.193 --> 19:28.745
I'm 32.

19:30.745 --> 19:32.882
You know, that coupon book
never expires.

19:32.883 --> 19:34.537
Yeah?

19:34.538 --> 19:36.813
So say you have kids,
and you have a wife,

19:36.814 --> 19:40.364
and you guys are, like,
doin' the suburban grind,

19:40.365 --> 19:41.950
I will fly in.

19:41.951 --> 19:43.571
I'll hold on to it.

19:45.917 --> 19:47.916
- What?
- Is it insane

19:47.917 --> 19:50.261
that I'm still hungry?

19:50.262 --> 19:52.399
Nope, not at all.

19:52.400 --> 19:56.123
And that's why I brought
the cake in here.

20:01.848 --> 20:04.524
That is a good friend.

20:05.779 --> 20:07.192
Wow.

20:07.193 --> 20:08.353
Yep.

20:15.469 --> 20:17.399
Okay. So, this is for glucose tablets.

20:17.400 --> 20:18.640
- Okay.
- Not a bad idea

20:18.641 --> 20:20.399
to carry them with you just in case.

20:20.400 --> 20:22.054
And if you're still
feeling weak tomorrow,

20:22.055 --> 20:24.154
I'd make an appointment
with your regular doctor,

20:24.165 --> 20:26.744
but you look great to me.

20:26.745 --> 20:28.950
Okay.

20:28.951 --> 20:30.950
So, is that... That's it?

20:30.951 --> 20:35.088
Unless there's something
else I can do for you.

20:35.089 --> 20:38.054
N... I-I don't think so.

20:38.055 --> 20:40.571
Okay. Well...

20:40.572 --> 20:42.192
it was nice to meet you, Abbi.

20:42.193 --> 20:44.433
Yeah, it was nice to meet you,
too, Dr. Marnel.

20:44.434 --> 20:47.882
You know, since we're done,
why don't you call me Leslie?

20:47.883 --> 20:49.606
Okay.

20:49.607 --> 20:51.365
Leslie.

21:12.986 --> 21:14.606
- Hey, Leslie.
- Yes?

21:14.607 --> 21:17.399
I was just thinking,
would it be illegal or whatever

21:17.400 --> 21:19.675
if I...

21:19.676 --> 21:22.744
if I got your phone number?

21:22.755 --> 21:24.479
It would not be illegal.

21:25.684 --> 21:28.338
So, even though it was
a conscious uncoupling,

21:28.339 --> 21:30.614
and we will stay friends,

21:30.615 --> 21:33.993
it was, devastating

21:33.994 --> 21:36.545
and tragically bittersweet

21:36.546 --> 21:39.649
and fully broke my heart.

21:39.650 --> 21:41.511
Obviously, you had a shitty night, too.

21:41.512 --> 21:43.890
I mean, look at you. You know,
let's never be apart again.

21:43.891 --> 21:45.856
And I'm just praying
that your nose returns

21:45.857 --> 21:47.821
to its beautiful goyish shape.

21:47.822 --> 21:50.304
Okay, so, my night
was, like, kind of nuts.

21:50.305 --> 21:51.821
It started off pretty bad,

21:51.822 --> 21:53.959
you know...
typical failure after failure.

21:53.960 --> 21:56.304
But then I realized, like,
I need to put myself out there

21:56.305 --> 21:59.097
alone, to meet all these,
like, rad art contacts.

21:59.098 --> 22:02.304
- Right?
- Dude, I met Toy Harris.

22:02.305 --> 22:04.890
Whoa! Who is that, though?

22:04.891 --> 22:06.614
Yeah. She's, like,
this incredible artist.

22:06.615 --> 22:08.169
And Smelly Pussy Donna was dope.

22:08.180 --> 22:09.924
She, like, introduced me
to all these people

22:09.935 --> 22:12.718
who told me about all these
artist residencies.

22:12.719 --> 22:15.097
She's kind of like my... friend.

22:15.098 --> 22:16.787
Totally! Right?

22:16.788 --> 22:19.476
Yeah. And then, at the E.R.,

22:19.477 --> 22:21.097
you know, after I smashed my face,

22:21.098 --> 22:23.304
- there was this hot doctor.
- Okay!

22:23.305 --> 22:26.097
And we, like, really hit it off.

22:26.098 --> 22:27.580
And then I realized the only reason

22:27.581 --> 22:30.097
I wasn't automatically asking them out

22:30.098 --> 22:31.683
was because she was a woman.

22:31.684 --> 22:33.614
You don't say.

22:33.615 --> 22:36.097
Yeah. So then I just did it.

22:36.098 --> 22:38.649
We're gonna go out on Friday night. Yes!

22:38.650 --> 22:41.545
It was really
a transformative night, dude.

22:41.546 --> 22:43.580
So cool. Yes!

22:43.581 --> 22:45.580
Yes! Cool! Cool! Cool! Cool!

22:45.581 --> 22:48.097
Cool! Cool! Cool! Cool!
Cool! Cool! C-C-Cool!

22:48.098 --> 22:50.373
Cool. That is so... cool.

22:50.374 --> 22:53.614
We just both had these sort of
life-altering nights

22:53.615 --> 22:56.028
out there on our own. Yes!

22:56.029 --> 22:57.856
Yeah.

23:05.270 --> 23:06.821
So, let's watch this thing?

23:06.822 --> 23:08.821
Yeah. Found it.

23:08.822 --> 23:12.614
Hello. My name is Donna Donatachi.

23:12.615 --> 23:16.373
Back in college, they used
to call me Smelly Pussy Donna.

23:16.374 --> 23:18.545
Well, not anymore!

23:21.477 --> 23:24.684
Read my lips... Yo-gurt!

23:25.523 --> 23:28.484

23:29.789 --> 23:31.684
My nipples are hard.

23:31.685 --> 23:34.271
Yeah, my balls tinglin' from this.

23:34.272 --> 23:36.581
- Wow.
- Yeah.

23:36.582 --> 23:38.305
As a man, we're usually

23:38.306 --> 23:40.512
not capable of multiple orgasms, but...

23:41.789 --> 23:44.341
this makes that false.
