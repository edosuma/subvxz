AS A HEAD WITHOUT A BODY,
I ENVY THE DEAD.

20:53.019 --> 20:54.953
NO ARGUMENT HERE.

20:58.490 --> 21:00.159
BENDER, HOW DID
THE FIGHT GO?

21:00.259 --> 21:01.594
I HEARD SOMEBODY
GOT FLATTENED.

21:01.693 --> 21:03.829
FRY, WHERE'S
YOUR BRAIN SLUG?

21:04.830 --> 21:08.500
POOR LITTLE GUY STARVED
TO DEATH.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.303
I'M PROUD OF YOU,
BENDER.

21:10.403 --> 21:12.203
SURE, YOU LOST--
YOU LOST BAD--

21:12.305 --> 21:13.972
BUT THE IMPORTANT THING IS

21:14.073 --> 21:16.976
I BEAT UP SOMEONE WHO HURT
MY FEELINGS IN HIGH SCHOOL.

21:17.076 --> 21:17.977
[ Laughs ]

21:18.076 --> 21:21.279
I'M IN TREMENDOUS PAIN HERE.

21:21.381 --> 21:22.981
GREAT JOB, KID.

21:23.082 --> 21:25.852
YOU LOST, AND YOU MADE IT LOOK
ALMOST HALF-REAL.

21:25.951 --> 21:27.686
I WANT YOU TO HAVE THIS CARD

21:27.787 --> 21:30.189
GOOD FOR TEN PERCENT OFF
AT BED, BATH AND BEYOND.

21:32.392 --> 21:33.559
YES...

21:33.660 --> 21:35.528
I'M THE GREATEST...

21:35.627 --> 21:36.462
THE GREATEST!

21:36.563 --> 21:37.630
[ Moans ]

21:37.730 --> 21:40.732
[ Little As Cosell ]
AND SO ENDS THE CHRONICLE

21:40.833 --> 21:44.471
OF ONE OF THE GREATEST
EVER TO PLAY THE SPORT.

21:44.570 --> 21:46.972
AN-AND HE DIDN'T LOOK
HALF-BAD IN A TUTU.

21:47.073 --> 21:49.842
THAT HE DID SURELY NOT.

21:49.942 --> 21:50.977
WHAT?
