00:12.011 --> 00:13.513
[narrator]  Previously on  Dynasty :

00:13.596 --> 00:16.224
[in Spanish] Mr. Calastana, on behalf of
Carrington Atlantic, it's a great honor.

00:16.306 --> 00:17.392
Hi, Celia.

00:18.393 --> 00:19.477
[shrieks]

00:19.561 --> 00:21.104
Get Blake to sign the deal.

00:21.187 --> 00:23.690
[in English] How could you bring
that monster back into our lives?

00:23.773 --> 00:26.484
You're talking about my husband
and Sammy Jo's father.

00:26.568 --> 00:29.696
Everything she owned could all be mine
when I marry her.

00:29.779 --> 00:31.281
I won't let you hurt my father.

00:31.364 --> 00:33.950
You take your best shot.
I'll rain hellfire down on you.

00:34.034 --> 00:37.537
That deal was never gonna happen.
He tried to play us against each other.

00:37.620 --> 00:39.080
[in Spanish] You just made a big mistake.

00:39.164 --> 00:42.667
No, you made a mistake,
by messing with me and my family.

00:42.751 --> 00:44.085
[in Spanish] After tonight...

00:44.169 --> 00:45.920
we're no longer sisters.

00:46.629 --> 00:48.757
-Here. Let me help you.
-[groaning]

01:06.483 --> 01:08.443
[Alejandro in English]
Sleeping beauty wakes.

01:10.111 --> 01:11.154
[Fallon] What have you done?

01:12.989 --> 01:13.823
Where am I?

01:15.992 --> 01:16.910
Oh, my God.

01:18.161 --> 01:19.412
Is this Venezuela?

01:19.871 --> 01:22.290
Did you two psychopaths take me home
with you?

01:22.373 --> 01:23.875
[in Spanish]
I preferred when she was asleep.

01:23.958 --> 01:27.879
We're not in Venezuela.
We can't go back there. Not empty-handed.

01:27.962 --> 01:30.924
I have to make up for the deal
your stepmother screwed me out of.

01:31.007 --> 01:34.636
So, I'm paying for Cristal's mistakes?
[grunts] How fitting.

01:34.719 --> 01:35.804
[Alejandro] Your father will pay,

01:35.887 --> 01:38.848
-assuming he wants you back.
-[in English] I wouldn't.

01:38.932 --> 01:42.060
He'll make you regret you ever heard
the name Carrington.

01:42.477 --> 01:46.648
I guarantee he's turning Atlanta
upside down trying to find me.

01:47.106 --> 01:49.400
I've never been so at peace.

01:49.484 --> 01:53.238
I don't know what's being done to me,
but it's so relaxing.

01:53.321 --> 01:55.615
[Cristal in English]
She's unlocking your chakras.

01:55.698 --> 01:57.325
-[bowls humming]
-Mmm.

01:57.408 --> 02:00.703
Not to mention my brother, who I was
supposed to be meeting this morning.

02:01.037 --> 02:03.748
When I don't show up,
he'll be sounding the alarms, too.

02:03.832 --> 02:05.667
-Doughnuts?
-[Steven] What happened there?

02:05.750 --> 02:08.544
Had to eat the gold-dusted bacon cruller
before Fallon did.

02:08.877 --> 02:09.753
[both chuckle]

02:09.838 --> 02:11.131
-Where is she?
-No idea.

02:11.214 --> 02:12.048
More for me.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.633
[Fallon]  Then there's
my business partner,

02:13.716 --> 02:17.303
Jeff Colby,
who I was going to meet last night.

02:17.387 --> 02:20.223
He was expecting me
before Bonnie Parker interrupted.

02:20.306 --> 02:22.517
I'm sure Jeff called the cops hours ago.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.352
[woman on recording]  ...and exhale.

02:24.435 --> 02:27.438
You two are in way over your heads.

02:27.522 --> 02:31.860
You think you have this all under control,
but everyone is looking for me.

02:31.943 --> 02:34.445
For God's sakes, I'm Fallon Carrington!

02:35.363 --> 02:36.447
Namaste.

02:38.366 --> 02:40.076
-Thank you.
-[Blake] Amazing.

02:40.160 --> 02:43.788
But you can't tell anyone I did that,
whatever that was.

02:43.872 --> 02:47.250
Oh, it'll be our little secret.

02:47.333 --> 02:48.459
[laughs]

02:49.711 --> 02:51.713
[both moaning]

02:53.256 --> 02:57.218
Don't get me started. We have a meeting
with the new chief of police.

02:57.302 --> 02:59.012
I saw that on our schedule.

02:59.554 --> 03:01.848
Given how close this family was
to Stansfield,

03:01.931 --> 03:04.976
it seemed only right that I reach out
to his replacement.

03:05.059 --> 03:09.188
Plus, police department's endorsement
would help Paul Daniels' campaign.

03:09.272 --> 03:10.899
-The senator?
-He's up for reelection.

03:11.608 --> 03:13.985
I delivered Stansfield's endorsement
last time,

03:14.068 --> 03:16.821
I'm hoping that the new chief is
as supportive.

03:16.905 --> 03:18.698
Maybe with a sizable donation.

03:19.240 --> 03:22.118
If they need more balloons
at the Policeman's Ball,

03:22.201 --> 03:23.912
I am happy to help.

03:24.871 --> 03:25.830
[chuckles]

03:28.750 --> 03:30.627
You're not taking the Versaces?

03:30.710 --> 03:32.462
Gianni died for your sins.

03:32.545 --> 03:34.756
-They're all yours.
-Thank you.

03:34.839 --> 03:38.051
Feels good walking away from all this,
you know.

03:38.551 --> 03:40.386
-Giving up the safety net.
-Mm.

03:41.304 --> 03:45.433
The buffet breakfast prepared
by personal chefs, in-house dry cleaning,

03:45.975 --> 03:49.145
afternoon rendezvous with Gustav
after massages.

03:50.688 --> 03:51.689
Don't be jealous.

03:53.107 --> 03:58.196
-I'll miss you, Sam. And my family.
-You're moving to Edgewood, not Australia.

03:58.613 --> 04:01.908
And you can never really leave family,
even if you want to.

04:02.408 --> 04:06.913
Cristal and I moved to another country
and still couldn't cut ties with ours.

04:06.996 --> 04:09.082
No one escapes Hurricane Machado.

04:10.124 --> 04:12.794
My last act of service to you,
Master Steven...

04:13.878 --> 04:15.922
before you come running home.

04:16.005 --> 04:19.007
Not this time, Anders. But thank you.

04:21.427 --> 04:22.887
I can feel the love.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.767
-Why?
-Just checking for a pulse.

04:29.060 --> 04:31.062
[clears throat, then chuckles]

04:37.944 --> 04:40.280
Chief Johnson, so sorry
to keep you waiting.

04:40.363 --> 04:41.990
We were stuck in a meeting.

04:42.073 --> 04:45.368
Running a multi-billion dollar company
keeps you busy.

04:45.451 --> 04:47.203
My COO Cristal, more importantly, my wife.

04:47.287 --> 04:51.916
-Welcome to Carrington Atlantic.
-And congratulations on your promotions.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.212
Tell me a little about yourself.
Are you a born-and-raised Atlantan?

04:56.296 --> 04:57.630
I am, just like you.

04:57.714 --> 05:01.801
Oh, so I'm sure, like me,
you value your ties to the community.

05:01.884 --> 05:03.136
[cell phone jingling]

05:03.594 --> 05:04.512
Sorry, heh.

05:05.179 --> 05:09.600
As I was saying, it's our goal at CA
to do what we can to--

05:09.684 --> 05:11.060
[cell phone jingling]

05:12.770 --> 05:13.604
[sighs]

05:14.272 --> 05:17.066
That's my daughter.
Could you give me a moment?

05:17.734 --> 05:18.609
Sure.

05:28.619 --> 05:31.414
-Fallon, this is not a great time.
-It never is.

05:32.540 --> 05:34.542
-Hello, Blake.
-Alejandro? How's--?

05:37.086 --> 05:41.758
-How do you have my daughter's phone?
-Not just her phone. I have your daughter.

05:43.134 --> 05:47.055
If you want her returned,
deliver 15 million in cash,

05:47.597 --> 05:52.518
provide us safe passage out of the country
for me, Iris and the money on your jet.

05:53.603 --> 05:54.687
I'll provide the pilot.

05:56.105 --> 05:57.440
If you contact the police,

05:58.232 --> 05:59.317
the deal...

06:00.818 --> 06:04.197
-and your daughter are dead.
-How do I know this isn't a hoax?

06:04.280 --> 06:08.534
I don't have time for jokes.
You have until 5 to gather the money.

06:12.872 --> 06:15.166
-That's not gonna happen.
- You'll make it happen.

06:15.249 --> 06:17.668
You probably have 15 mil
in your bedside table.

06:17.752 --> 06:20.088
Something's getting lost in translation.

06:21.172 --> 06:23.091
It's not the 15 million.

06:23.174 --> 06:25.009
I'm not paying anything.

06:45.321 --> 06:48.908
-I should see where Blake went.
-I have my department to run.

06:48.991 --> 06:51.160
We're not global, but we are busy.

06:51.702 --> 06:57.166
Blake and I are committed to continuing to
support your department in any way we can.

06:57.250 --> 07:00.461
In return, Blake was hoping you'd support
Paul Daniels' next election.

07:00.545 --> 07:03.422
-Sorry?
-Your department backed him in 2016,

07:03.506 --> 07:05.299
and Blake wanted to convey--

07:05.383 --> 07:09.220
That was Stansfield's department.
And Daniels is not my senator.

07:10.012 --> 07:12.765
If Blake invited me, thinking he could buy
our endorsement--

07:12.849 --> 07:14.434
Not buy, of course not.

07:15.852 --> 07:18.855
If you knew us, you'd know
that we wanna give back to the city

07:18.938 --> 07:20.481
that has given us so much.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.526
Can we try this again?

07:30.908 --> 07:34.245
Where the hell did you go?
You left me in there to drown.

07:34.954 --> 07:37.123
Uh... I just got a call from Alejandro.

07:37.707 --> 07:41.002
-He and your sister have Fallon.
-What does that mean?

07:41.085 --> 07:44.172
-They want $15 million ransom.
-They kidnapped her?

07:44.755 --> 07:48.759
-We have to tell Chief Johnson.
-No. We're not involving anyone.

07:48.843 --> 07:50.178
I am doing this my way.

07:50.261 --> 07:52.513
Alejandro is dangerous. You don't--

07:52.597 --> 07:55.683
He knows that a hostage
is only worth anything alive.

07:57.852 --> 08:01.939
Even if this isn't a bluff,
we need to be willing to walk away.

08:02.023 --> 08:05.109
-Or give him what he wants.
-Caving into their demands this early

08:05.193 --> 08:07.403
would only leave us more vulnerable
down the road.

08:08.029 --> 08:11.782
He doesn't take you seriously.
It's why he isn't engaging.

08:11.866 --> 08:14.827
You're telling me how to do this?
You're not my first hostage.

08:14.911 --> 08:17.872
You're not the first arrogant douche bag
I've seen ruin a deal.

08:17.955 --> 08:21.250
You admitted you don't know what
you're doing by asking for 15 million.

08:21.334 --> 08:25.213
You think that's what I'm worth?
I make that much in one quarter.

08:25.296 --> 08:27.423
Honestly, I'm kind of insulted.

08:27.507 --> 08:28.716
[in Spanish] We should've taken
the other kid.

08:30.551 --> 08:33.221
Stay here... and stay calm.

08:33.679 --> 08:34.764
How?

08:34.847 --> 08:36.599
How are you so calm?

08:37.683 --> 08:38.934
Because I'm in control.

08:39.434 --> 08:42.813
And as long as it stays that way...
we'll be all right.

08:44.857 --> 08:46.609
[cell phone ringing]

08:48.653 --> 08:49.695
Dad. What's up?

08:49.779 --> 08:51.614
-[Blake]  Have you seen Fallon today?
-No.

08:51.697 --> 08:54.116
She didn't wanna get roped
into helping me pack.

08:55.910 --> 08:56.869
Is everything okay?

08:58.871 --> 08:59.789
Are you alone?

08:59.872 --> 09:03.751
-I'm with Sam.
-Don't go anywhere. I'll be there soon.

09:03.834 --> 09:04.794
Oh--

09:07.713 --> 09:08.548
[Culhane] Sir?

09:09.298 --> 09:12.260
-What's going on?
-We have a situation.

09:15.304 --> 09:18.182
Fallon has been taken by Sam's father,
Alejandro.

09:20.726 --> 09:21.644
[sighs]

09:21.727 --> 09:24.438
-What can I do?
-Drive. That's what you can do.

09:27.942 --> 09:30.653
It's important that we keep
our emotions in check.

09:33.614 --> 09:38.035
I know how much my daughter means
to you... the last four years.

09:39.579 --> 09:40.413
You knew?

09:40.496 --> 09:41.330
Yeah.

09:41.956 --> 09:43.833
[clears throat] Sir, I'm sorry.

09:43.916 --> 09:44.750
I'm not.

09:46.794 --> 09:49.338
I've always liked you.
I consider myself lucky

09:49.422 --> 09:51.507
that she's with someone
who was so good to her.

09:53.050 --> 09:55.052
[cell phone jingling]

09:58.472 --> 10:00.766
-Yeah?
-You wanted to play hardball,

10:00.850 --> 10:02.602
so let's play.

10:03.060 --> 10:06.689
Thanks to your hesitation, the price
has gone up. Twenty-five million.

10:06.772 --> 10:10.526
-That's not how a negotiation works.
-We're not negotiating.

10:10.610 --> 10:13.029
I have no reason to believe
you have my daughter.

10:13.487 --> 10:16.198
Oh, you wanted proof?
Why didn't you say so?

10:19.744 --> 10:22.038
[Fallon]  No, no!  [screams]

10:22.663 --> 10:27.043
You touch one hair on her head...
you get nothing.

10:27.126 --> 10:29.378
I wouldn't waste your breath on threats,

10:29.462 --> 10:32.715
or you may not recognize your daughter
by the time you get her back.

10:33.215 --> 10:35.009
You have less than four hours.

10:39.597 --> 10:41.223
-[Culhane] Sir?
-Just drive.

10:52.276 --> 10:53.653
I've dismissed the staff.

10:54.278 --> 10:56.781
The fewer variables we have, the better.
Where's Sam?

10:56.864 --> 10:59.200
-Want me to find him?
-No. Keep an eye

10:59.283 --> 11:00.993
-on the camera closest to him.
-Dad.

11:01.077 --> 11:03.621
Can't forget, it's his parents
that have your sister.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.956
We can't trust anyone
except for the people in this room.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.208
-Cristal?
-And Cristal.

11:07.291 --> 11:08.959
Whose sister is the reason
we're in this situation.

11:09.043 --> 11:11.170
I don't have time to argue with you.

11:12.046 --> 11:16.133
The question still remains. Do we engage,
or do we play out the gambit?

11:16.217 --> 11:18.386
-We engage.
-If we wait, we force them to pivot.

11:18.469 --> 11:20.304
Getty strung out his son's kidnappers
for months.

11:20.388 --> 11:23.265
-Kid lost an ear. He was never the same.
-They didn't kill him.

11:24.975 --> 11:29.688
As harsh as it may sound... a dead body
only gets them the gas chamber.

11:29.772 --> 11:32.108
-This isn't a game.
-No, it's a negotiation.

11:32.191 --> 11:33.734
It's what I do best.

11:33.818 --> 11:36.028
So, fall in line or you can leave.

11:39.198 --> 11:41.700
-Where are we with finances?
-Sam?

11:43.285 --> 11:44.453
What is happening?

11:45.454 --> 11:46.455
It can't be true.

11:48.165 --> 11:50.918
With everything you have in the safe,
your checking accounts

11:51.001 --> 11:55.297
and your safety-deposit boxes,
you'd have $11 million by the deadline.

11:55.381 --> 11:57.883
Even if we wanted to engage,
we're 14 short.

11:57.967 --> 12:01.137
You're not liquid enough,
not on such short notice.

12:02.263 --> 12:06.225
-I caught up Sammy Jo.
-Of course. He should be.

12:06.308 --> 12:09.478
I'm sorry. I can't believe
my parents could do something like this.

12:09.562 --> 12:12.106
-Or at least my mom.
-[Cristal] No need to apologize.

12:12.189 --> 12:15.109
This has no reflection on you.
We're all on the same team.

12:15.609 --> 12:19.780
-We're 14 million short. Price went up.
-You have friends with money. Call them.

12:19.864 --> 12:23.033
It's dangerous. The second this leaves
our circle, everything changes.

12:23.576 --> 12:26.745
It stays in the family.
We're in control and we hold the cards.

12:26.829 --> 12:28.831
Apart from the wild card that is Fallon.

12:28.914 --> 12:31.667
[weeping] How am I supposed
to live like this?

12:32.209 --> 12:33.085
Bangs?

12:35.588 --> 12:38.340
My stylist books four months out.

12:38.966 --> 12:40.342
Five for extensions.

12:40.426 --> 12:41.510
[Alejandro] You're lucky.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.721
-Hair grows back.
-Not by summer.

12:45.139 --> 12:48.976
-You should've shot me.
-Keep talking, I'll turn it into a mullet.

12:50.019 --> 12:52.271
[in Spanish] I'm going out.
Watch the bitch.

12:56.317 --> 12:57.943
[Fallon] God, he's such an ass.

12:58.861 --> 13:00.988
How could you be with a guy like that?

13:01.614 --> 13:04.867
You're cute, in an Eileen Fisher way.

13:05.242 --> 13:08.996
You seem smart when I can understand
what you're saying. You could do better.

13:09.079 --> 13:10.414
[in Spanish] Please stop talking.

13:10.498 --> 13:12.333
I bet none of this was your idea.

13:13.125 --> 13:17.254
When I look at you, I'm not like,
"I bet she has chloroform in her purse."

13:18.255 --> 13:21.008
Though you seem like the type
who would do anything for a man.

13:21.467 --> 13:23.928
-[in English] What does that mean?
-The doe-eyed,

13:24.011 --> 13:26.013
insecure, Squeaky Fromme-type.

13:26.096 --> 13:30.726
Alejandro and I are partners, okay?
I wouldn't be here if I didn't wanna be.

13:30.809 --> 13:33.103
You mean, if he didn't want you to be.

13:33.729 --> 13:35.814
He calls the shots from what I see.

13:36.690 --> 13:39.735
But I also see that you're stronger
than you think.

13:40.569 --> 13:42.988
Really? You see me?

13:43.739 --> 13:48.786
You're a gold-plated bitch who thinks
the world revolves around her.

13:49.662 --> 13:52.039
So, if you think you're gonna turn me

13:52.122 --> 13:56.252
by preaching some sort
of sisterhood propaganda...

13:57.670 --> 13:58.963
you can screw off.

14:01.674 --> 14:04.218
Oh, and if you think that me working
with Alejandro

14:04.301 --> 14:08.430
means he has control over me,
what about the men in your life?

14:08.514 --> 14:10.099
Where are you pulling that from?

14:10.849 --> 14:12.226
I answer to no man.

14:12.309 --> 14:14.270
But you're Daddy's little girl.

14:15.437 --> 14:19.149
I was at your party, trust fund baby.

14:19.233 --> 14:21.193
Everything you have is from him.

14:21.277 --> 14:22.278
Not my career.

14:22.820 --> 14:23.654
That's right.

14:24.154 --> 14:29.034
My sister said that you quit
his company... to work for another man.

14:31.036 --> 14:31.871
No.

14:32.621 --> 14:36.667
Jeff just backs the company.
I am still the boss, technically.

14:37.209 --> 14:42.339
Well... technically, I'm the boss now.

14:43.507 --> 14:44.425
[sighs]

14:46.760 --> 14:48.929
As soon as we get the location,
my friend is meeting me there.

14:49.013 --> 14:51.056
I thought we were keeping this
in the family.

14:51.140 --> 14:53.934
Gavin is like family
with Israeli military training.

14:54.018 --> 14:55.728
I prefer New Zealand's SIS program,

14:55.811 --> 14:58.647
helps one find their way
around a firearm more efficiently.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.316
You can be backup, Anders.

15:00.399 --> 15:01.442
[knocking on door]

15:06.530 --> 15:09.116
If you're looking for Fallon,
she called off work.

15:09.199 --> 15:11.994
-Little too much fun at her birthday.
-[Anders] Heck of a hangover.

15:12.077 --> 15:14.538
Save it. Mike said you needed help.

15:14.622 --> 15:16.081
-Mike?
-[Culhane] I called him.

15:20.002 --> 15:23.923
This is all I could do on short notice.
Eight in cash and jewelry.

15:24.965 --> 15:27.259
Get out. This is a family matter.

15:28.052 --> 15:30.971
Fallon said business and family are one
and the same.

15:31.472 --> 15:35.142
-I assume she learned that from you.
-Fallon's safety's more important

15:35.225 --> 15:38.395
-than whatever's going on between you two.
-Even with his 8 million,

15:38.479 --> 15:39.772
still less than Alejandro wanted.

15:39.855 --> 15:43.400
Could be enough to get Fallon to safety
before he does the final count.

15:43.484 --> 15:47.363
And give our military friend a chance
to get a shot off if he's good enough.

15:50.532 --> 15:52.409
-Okay.
-Great. Where's the drop?

15:52.868 --> 15:54.870
-I'll take it from here.
-The hell you will.

15:54.954 --> 15:57.081
This is not a debate.
I'm doing this alone.

16:00.709 --> 16:04.755
Reread your confidentiality agreement
before making more unilateral decisions.

16:04.838 --> 16:06.715
-Blake, I'm sorry.
-I understand.

16:08.050 --> 16:09.343
You were just trying to help.

16:10.010 --> 16:14.723
Since you got Colby involved, you can help
by making sure he is not a problem.

16:17.476 --> 16:19.812
Or else we have a problem, understand?

16:21.146 --> 16:21.981
Yes, sir.

16:34.368 --> 16:35.244
[knocks on door]

16:35.744 --> 16:36.787
Can I come in?

16:37.621 --> 16:38.664
Everything okay?

16:38.747 --> 16:41.041
-You didn't hear from Fallon, did you?
-No.

16:41.917 --> 16:44.920
I wanted to thank you for rounding up
that money.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.005
Wish I could do more.

16:46.088 --> 16:48.924
Same. Blake froze me out
of his rescue mission, too.

16:49.341 --> 16:53.345
I thought maybe I'd stop by her office,
see if I could find anything that'll help.

16:54.680 --> 16:58.809
Maybe we form our own operation.
Thought I'd start by tracking her car.

16:58.892 --> 17:01.228
She didn't take one.
All vehicles are accounted for.

17:01.311 --> 17:05.733
Maybe yours, but when I was at the manor,
I didn't see the Porsche I got Fallon.

17:06.900 --> 17:07.859
You got her--?

17:09.111 --> 17:12.071
Of course you did. So, can you track it?

17:15.242 --> 17:18.369
I'm no appraiser, but these are real.

17:18.454 --> 17:20.622
Not that a fisherman
from Caracas would know.

17:20.705 --> 17:23.751
It's still less than he wants.
Alejandro might balk at that alone.

17:23.834 --> 17:25.836
-It's almost 5:00.
-When will he call?

17:25.919 --> 17:29.339
Last minute. He won't want us
getting ahead of him and setting a trap.

17:29.423 --> 17:30.507
All we can do is wait.

17:30.591 --> 17:33.510
Do you kidnap many children
on your day off?

17:33.594 --> 17:34.720
[doorbell rings]

17:35.804 --> 17:37.431
That better not be Colby again.

17:43.896 --> 17:46.607
-Hi. I'm here for the Carringtons.
-[Cristal] Oh, my God.

17:48.442 --> 17:49.735
Uh, Chief Bobbi Johnson.

17:49.818 --> 17:54.364
Forgot I invited her when you ditched me.
I was trying to make things less awkward.

17:54.448 --> 17:57.117
-Couldn't be more awkward.
-Cristal invited me for dinner.

17:57.201 --> 18:02.122
-Of course. Come in. May I take your coat?
-I'll tell her I have a migraine.

18:02.206 --> 18:05.167
No. We can't raise any red flags,
especially not now.

18:05.876 --> 18:08.378
Besides, we still need that endorsement.

18:10.380 --> 18:11.882
Let's start you off with a drink.

18:12.883 --> 18:14.468
[Bobbi] Oh, my coat. Thank you.

18:17.596 --> 18:19.598
Anybody left in the kitchen?

18:19.681 --> 18:23.393
-I dismissed everyone.
-It could be cold cuts and string cheese.

18:23.477 --> 18:25.854
And that won't look at all suspicious,
will it?

18:25.938 --> 18:26.939
[sighs]

18:30.526 --> 18:32.069
How long have you been
with the department?

18:32.152 --> 18:36.490
Uh, 15 years. Started out as a beat cop,
graduated to detective.

18:36.573 --> 18:40.577
I worked a lot of different cases:
robberies, murders, kidnappings.

18:40.661 --> 18:41.537
[coughs]

18:41.620 --> 18:44.373
-Are you all right?
-[Steven] Yeah. Just the wrong pipe.

18:44.456 --> 18:45.499
[Steven clears throat]

18:46.583 --> 18:49.002
-Can I pour you another glass?
-Oh, sure.

18:49.086 --> 18:50.712
-How rude of me.
-Thank you.

18:52.005 --> 18:52.881
[both gasp]

18:52.965 --> 18:55.884
-I'm sorry.
-Would you get us a towel, Anders?

18:55.968 --> 18:58.137
At least it's not red wine. [chuckles]

19:04.184 --> 19:06.186
[Cristal] Oh! Um...

19:06.270 --> 19:08.063
[Steven] That must've been
from last night.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.565
We had a party here for my sister.

19:09.648 --> 19:12.067
-Fake jewels all over the table.
-Yeah.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.486
-Remarkable how real it looks.
-[cell phone jingling]

19:14.570 --> 19:17.030
Excuse me. It's another work emergency.

19:17.614 --> 19:18.949
[Cristal clears throat]

19:22.327 --> 19:24.580
-Welcome to my childhood.
-[chuckles]

19:27.166 --> 19:28.584
-I have the money.
-[Alejandro in English]  Good.

19:28.667 --> 19:30.752
Fulton County Airport. Alone.

19:30.836 --> 19:34.006
I'll be waiting outside
the private terminal. You have one hour.

19:35.132 --> 19:36.925
[cell phone beeping]

19:37.551 --> 19:41.555
It's go time. Fulton County Airport.
Get your team into position now.

19:42.931 --> 19:43.849
What team?

19:44.433 --> 19:45.517
What are you doing?

19:46.310 --> 19:49.563
-Why aren't you out there with Bobbi?
-Alejandro told you to go alone.

19:49.646 --> 19:52.941
Single backup's one thing. If he finds out
you're trying to ambush him,

19:54.109 --> 19:55.110
he'll kill her.

19:55.736 --> 19:57.863
Fallon is my daughter.
We're doing it my way.

20:13.253 --> 20:15.172
-Where did you get that?
-[Fallon] What?

20:15.714 --> 20:16.798
I--

20:16.882 --> 20:18.592
-Iris gave it to me.
-She's lying.

20:18.675 --> 20:20.302
-Why would I help her? Ah!
-Shut up!

20:24.932 --> 20:25.766
As for you...

20:30.395 --> 20:33.398
you're lucky your daddy is coming
to rescue you.

20:34.399 --> 20:35.776
Or you'd get it worse.

20:39.571 --> 20:42.074
Time to get out of here. Let's go.

20:51.375 --> 20:52.251
Hey.

20:52.334 --> 20:53.335
Are you okay?

20:53.627 --> 20:54.503
Come here.

20:56.421 --> 20:59.091
You know none of this has to do with you,
right?

21:02.678 --> 21:03.679
[sighs]

21:03.762 --> 21:05.097
I know they're awful,

21:05.931 --> 21:09.768
but as much as I can't stand thinking
something might happen to Fallon,

21:09.851 --> 21:13.438
I'm terrified to think that my parents
might not make it out alive.

21:17.109 --> 21:20.404
-Have you tried calling your mom?
-No, I didn't think I should.

21:21.446 --> 21:23.323
Didn't wanna interfere with Blake's plan.

21:27.244 --> 21:28.328
Can I borrow your phone?

21:30.747 --> 21:33.208
No, thanks for going out there.

21:36.003 --> 21:38.380
My security guy found Fallon's car,

21:38.463 --> 21:42.676
ditched in an empty parking structure,
still had the gold bow on it.

21:43.510 --> 21:45.470
I got a bad feeling about this.

21:45.554 --> 21:48.265
-We need real help.
-Alejandro said no cops.

21:48.348 --> 21:50.517
I don't give a damn
what some Alejandro said.

21:50.600 --> 21:51.852
Blake said no cops.

21:51.935 --> 21:54.646
-I don't care what he thinks.
-I'm saying it, too.

21:56.023 --> 21:56.898
[scoffs]

22:02.404 --> 22:04.031
-Pick up my damn phone.
-[chuckles]

22:08.160 --> 22:10.912
Pick up my phone
or we got a problem, bruh.

22:13.498 --> 22:17.044
You asked for my help,
had no problems taking my money.

22:17.127 --> 22:20.213
I'm not gonna let you jeopardize
Fallon's life by calling the cops.

22:20.630 --> 22:23.425
-I shouldn't have let you get this far.
-[scoffs] Let me?

22:24.092 --> 22:24.926
Let me?

22:26.928 --> 22:30.140
You didn't come to help,
you came to keep an eye on me.

22:30.223 --> 22:31.058
Wow.

22:31.725 --> 22:36.480
Carrington has your leash pulled tight.
He train you, too? Teach you to stay?

22:37.981 --> 22:39.191
I came here for Fallon.

22:40.567 --> 22:41.902
Does Monica know that?

22:43.528 --> 22:45.113
If you can't let my girlfriend go,

22:45.197 --> 22:47.699
the least you could do
is stop screwing my sister.

22:47.783 --> 22:49.034
[scoffs]

22:54.873 --> 22:56.041
[both grunting]

23:08.720 --> 23:11.640
With state funding drying up,
the Carrington Foundation

23:11.723 --> 23:14.726
handed out a million dollars
in law enforcement grants last year.

23:14.810 --> 23:15.936
That is very generous.

23:16.019 --> 23:19.815
Stansfield never hesitated to ask when
he needed something. You shouldn't either.

23:19.898 --> 23:23.527
Sorry to interrupt.
I have a question about the main course.

23:29.074 --> 23:30.742
I loaded everything into the Bentley.

23:30.826 --> 23:33.245
Our money, Jeff's duffle,
but there's a problem.

23:34.454 --> 23:35.372
The Bentley's gone.

23:35.455 --> 23:37.249
-What do you mean?
-And so is Cristal.

24:01.982 --> 24:04.192
[Alejandro] You're lucky
your sister took the call.

24:04.276 --> 24:05.652
[Cristal] You're the lucky one.

24:05.735 --> 24:07.028
You'd be dead if she hadn't.

24:07.112 --> 24:09.948
There's a team of snipers waiting for you
at the airport.

24:10.824 --> 24:13.160
I have your money,
but I need to see her first.

24:44.232 --> 24:45.275
What is this?

24:45.358 --> 24:48.403
You didn't give us time. Those will more
than cover the balance.

24:48.486 --> 24:52.157
What, do I look like, a pawnshop?
How do I know these are real?

24:52.240 --> 24:55.160
[in Spanish] You've always been a lying
bitch finding a way to screw me over.

24:55.243 --> 24:58.538
There's 16 million in cash, Alejandro,
that's plenty.

24:58.622 --> 25:00.165
Just let Fallon go.

25:00.248 --> 25:02.667
[in English] What I need is
more collateral, not less.

25:03.418 --> 25:04.336
Get in the car.

25:06.379 --> 25:07.339
[Cristal] Iris.

25:07.964 --> 25:09.633
[Alejandro] Get in the car.

25:26.942 --> 25:27.943
[Culhane sighs]

25:28.735 --> 25:30.403
Not a bad hook for a tech kid.

25:31.529 --> 25:32.989
I wasn't always a tech kid.

25:33.073 --> 25:35.450
My bad. Private school kid.

25:36.368 --> 25:38.453
You and I grew up fighting
the same fights.

25:38.536 --> 25:42.249
Did we? Is this the part where you say
that we're not so different after all?

25:42.332 --> 25:46.836
You and I are nothing alike. You fight
like a guy who has something to prove.

25:47.295 --> 25:48.505
I've already proven it.

25:49.047 --> 25:53.802
-Why are you so pretentious?
-Because I have no one to answer to.

25:54.219 --> 25:56.554
-[scoffs]
-[cell phone jingling]

25:56.638 --> 25:58.098
And there he is.

25:58.181 --> 26:03.561
-No. Money doesn't buy you freedom. Hello?
-Michael, I need you to track the Bentley.

26:03.645 --> 26:05.855
- You can do that, right?
-I'll need a minute.

26:06.189 --> 26:08.483
But why that car? What's going on?

26:08.566 --> 26:11.069
Cristal went rogue.
She went to deliver the ransom.

26:11.152 --> 26:12.612
I'm on it. I'll call you back.

26:13.655 --> 26:17.325
If Cristal made the drop, they could've
ditched her car like they did Fallon's.

26:17.409 --> 26:19.661
-Seeing as how it's our only lead...
-It isn't.

26:20.203 --> 26:21.955
We should follow the money.

26:22.038 --> 26:25.125
I put a tracking device on one
of the watches with the ransom.

26:25.208 --> 26:26.293
So, how do we track it?

26:28.420 --> 26:29.462
Who are you calling?

26:30.005 --> 26:32.215
If you wanna do it Blake's way, go do it.

26:32.674 --> 26:36.219
If not, what's he gonna do, fire you?

26:36.845 --> 26:37.679
Let him.

26:38.888 --> 26:40.598
Come work with me and Fallon.

26:44.561 --> 26:47.856
Dad, I am dying out there.
The longer Chief Johnson is here,

26:47.939 --> 26:49.733
the more likely she is to figure out
what's going on.

26:49.816 --> 26:53.737
-I think we should just tell her--
-Can no one follow a directive?

26:53.820 --> 26:57.240
-What's so hard to understand?
-All of it. Fallon's been kidnapped,

26:57.324 --> 26:59.951
and the chief of police is sitting
in our Great Room.

27:00.035 --> 27:02.537
All I need is for you to buy me
another hour.

27:02.620 --> 27:05.332
Where is Sam? I told you
to keep an eye on him.

27:05.415 --> 27:08.084
It's not outside the realm of possibility
he's in on this.

27:08.168 --> 27:13.423
That boy is about to lose his family in
one fell swoop, his life is falling apart.

27:13.506 --> 27:16.801
Last thing he needs is for us to point
an accusing finger at him.

27:18.053 --> 27:18.887
Sir.

27:20.221 --> 27:21.598
[cell phone jingling]

27:22.807 --> 27:24.517
Culhane, did you get the address?

27:27.896 --> 27:30.732
-That's in Union City.
-Twenty minutes from here.

27:30.815 --> 27:33.693
But if your military contact is
at Fulton County Airport--

27:33.777 --> 27:35.153
Well, I can't wait for them.

27:35.779 --> 27:36.613
I'm on my way.

27:37.405 --> 27:40.033
[Fallon]  Just when I thought
things couldn't get any worse.

27:41.159 --> 27:42.911
Did you really have to tie us together?

27:43.495 --> 27:45.538
She smells like she took a bath
in patchouli.

27:45.622 --> 27:47.999
[Alejandro] Get used to it.
Since I didn't get my plane,

27:48.750 --> 27:51.503

to get out of Atlanta safely.

the money to the truck.

27:55.048 --> 27:56.091
We're leaving in half an hour.

27:57.592 --> 27:59.094
Please don't do anything stupid.

28:03.598 --> 28:05.558
There's gotta be something here
we can use.

28:05.642 --> 28:07.894
Wow, great idea. Original.

28:08.395 --> 28:10.397
They caught me trying to melt off
my zip ties.

28:10.480 --> 28:12.107
-With what?
-A lighter.

28:12.190 --> 28:14.776
Then the Demon Barber of Caracas
hurled it over there.

28:15.235 --> 28:16.736
Right after he hit Iris.

28:18.696 --> 28:20.448
Your sister's pretty Stockholmed, huh?

28:21.616 --> 28:23.785
I can't help thinking it's my fault.

28:24.285 --> 28:27.414
-If I hadn't abandoned her in Venezuela--
-You are far from perfect,

28:27.497 --> 28:29.499
but you are not responsible for her crazy.

28:29.582 --> 28:31.000
She's my sister.

28:34.712 --> 28:35.630
But so are you.

28:37.715 --> 28:40.510
-Yeah. I'm not--
-I'm gonna get you out of here.

28:41.344 --> 28:43.221
Now, how do these work?

28:43.304 --> 28:45.515
They're plastic, more your medium.

28:46.266 --> 28:47.934
If it were a Cartier Love bracelet--

28:48.017 --> 28:50.061
What about that gold hair stick
I gave you?

28:50.145 --> 28:52.480
-You mean gold-plated.
-Shut up.

28:52.564 --> 28:54.607
Tilt your head. I'm gonna pull it out.

28:54.691 --> 28:56.443
Come on. Down this way.

28:57.318 --> 28:58.445
-To the left.
-Okay.

28:59.237 --> 29:02.699
Now, pull down, go. Got it.

-Are they inside?
-Don't know. We can't get in.

29:45.909 --> 29:48.203
I understand you tracked the money.
Thanks for that.

29:48.286 --> 29:50.997
Now wait for my security.
We can't take chances.

You grab these two.

-Her men have come to rescue her.

30:05.887 --> 30:07.430

The only reason I didn't kick your ass
harder after everything you said

with the Carringtons.

to help you pack.

just to get out of it.

You're your own hero.

38:04.115 --> 38:05.700
And it's all right if it's not.

38:06.492 --> 38:08.703
Just because your relationship
was fraught,

38:09.120 --> 38:11.747
doesn't mean you shouldn't take time
to mourn him.

38:11.831 --> 38:13.082
If I'm being honest,

38:13.874 --> 38:16.252
you've been more of a father to me
than he ever was.

I was actually thinking maybe it's time
for me to move out.

38:35.396 --> 38:37.773
Find my own path, like you said.

38:37.857 --> 38:40.818
-Try to make it on my own.
-No need to make it on your own.

38:40.901 --> 38:42.069
That's what family's for.

38:42.903 --> 38:43.738
Well, yeah.

38:48.409 --> 38:50.411
That's why I'm moving in with Steven.

38:58.085 --> 38:59.170
[knock on door]

39:00.171 --> 39:01.213
[Cristal] Are you okay?

39:03.591 --> 39:05.343
I know that I owe you an apology.

39:07.678 --> 39:12.224
I'm sorry this happened to you and that
you felt the need to go behind my back.

39:12.308 --> 39:14.435
You were acting like a dictator.

39:14.518 --> 39:17.146
I knew you couldn't understand
the danger we were in.

39:17.229 --> 39:20.358
Clearly, I was right. You could've
gotten Fallon killed or yourself.

39:20.441 --> 39:21.942
I was just trying to help.

39:22.777 --> 39:25.571
I can't compartmentalize my feelings
like you can.

39:26.489 --> 39:29.367
The way you were trying
to control everything and everyone.

39:29.450 --> 39:31.243
I wasn't gonna lose another child.

39:32.661 --> 39:34.246
Blake, what are you talking about?

39:38.084 --> 39:40.711
Before Steven and Fallon were born...

39:43.214 --> 39:44.882
Alexis and I had a son.

39:49.053 --> 39:52.056
When he was 6 months old,
someone broke in the house, took him.

39:52.139 --> 39:53.891
Blake, I'm so sorry.

39:55.101 --> 39:57.478
I did everything they tell you to do.

39:58.062 --> 39:59.063
We were compliant.

39:59.146 --> 40:02.858
Anders can tell you, I had my doubts,
but we did what the police told us,

40:02.942 --> 40:06.987
and then one errant rookie cop
with a hero complex...

40:09.365 --> 40:10.449
got trigger-happy.

40:12.660 --> 40:15.955
The kidnappers fired back,
a couple cops were shot.

40:16.038 --> 40:16.872
They got away.

40:21.460 --> 40:23.254
They took my son from me.

40:26.590 --> 40:28.008
I never saw Adam again.

40:30.136 --> 40:31.887
Steven and Fallon don't even know.

40:33.055 --> 40:35.433
I wasn't about to lose another child,

40:36.058 --> 40:37.810
and I wasn't gonna lose you.

40:46.861 --> 40:52.116

You took your time playing your games ♪

40:52.825 --> 40:58.080

40:59.582 --> 41:00.416
[chuckles]

41:01.333 --> 41:05.421
Not even a kidnapping could keep
Fallon Carrington from working it.

41:05.504 --> 41:08.591
They might've stolen my hair,
but they can never steal my hustle.

41:08.674 --> 41:10.509
I am just happy you're safe.

41:10.593 --> 41:12.595
It doesn't compare
to what you went through,

41:12.678 --> 41:16.348
but the thought of you getting hurt,
I never wanna feel that again.

41:18.225 --> 41:20.811
I've always held a torch for you, Fallon.

41:22.104 --> 41:24.815
But now I realize it's more than that.

41:25.524 --> 41:27.985
Well, yesterday made some things clearer
for me, too.

41:30.279 --> 41:32.573
I wanna invest my money in our company,

41:34.241 --> 41:36.160
but I wanna use it to buy you out.

41:37.620 --> 41:40.164
If you're not okay with that,
then you can buy me out.

41:40.247 --> 41:41.415
Make me an offer.

41:41.499 --> 41:45.044
And as for us, I know
I was only tied up for a day,

41:45.669 --> 41:49.048
but it made me realize that I have
been tied to somebody my entire life.

41:49.757 --> 41:52.551
I need to see this through, on my own.
