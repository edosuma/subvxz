00:00.400 --> 00:01.635
Previously on Legacies...
ALARIC: Yesterday,

00:01.635 --> 00:03.237
we were confronted by a dragon.

00:03.237 --> 00:05.472
Why do you want this so badly?
What's so special about it?

00:05.472 --> 00:07.241
ALARIC: And then a gargoyle
come to life.

00:07.241 --> 00:09.576
None of this started happening
until you showed up

00:09.576 --> 00:10.477
and stole their knife,
which is exactly

00:10.477 --> 00:12.279
what the other monsters
came here to do.

00:12.279 --> 00:13.413
MG:
Kaleb.

00:13.413 --> 00:15.649
I saw you feed on her.
Yeah.

00:15.649 --> 00:17.551
'Cause you got to know
who you stand with.

00:19.419 --> 00:22.422
Foster kid, I've been
looking for you.
Jed, right?

00:22.422 --> 00:24.291
We just want to initiate you
into the pack.

00:24.291 --> 00:25.692
You don't have a choice.

00:27.594 --> 00:29.363
Landon told me he didn't know
why he stole the knife.

00:29.363 --> 00:30.764
But then he lied
about having it,

00:30.764 --> 00:33.200
so I don't know what
to believe.

00:33.200 --> 00:36.136
ALARIC: Whoever wields it has
the power to save the world

00:36.136 --> 00:37.871
or end all life as we know it.

00:37.871 --> 00:39.239
It's hard to say.

00:39.239 --> 00:40.674
But we're gonna find out.

00:40.674 --> 00:42.609
I'll call if I run
into any problems.

02:01.388 --> 02:03.557
ALARIC:
Given recent events,

02:03.557 --> 02:04.958
some students
have expressed concern

02:04.958 --> 02:07.361
that I am not allowing you
to have a say

02:07.361 --> 02:10.464
in the decisions
that affect your future.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.199
And I agree.

02:12.199 --> 02:14.601
If you are expected to abide
by this school's policies,

02:14.601 --> 02:16.536
it's only fair
that you have a voice

02:16.536 --> 02:19.306
in how those rules are made.

02:19.306 --> 02:22.909
So, I am forming
an honor council.

02:24.444 --> 02:27.714
One vampire,
one witch and one werewolf,

02:27.714 --> 02:29.950
each elected by their peers.

02:29.950 --> 02:31.985
Along with our
school counselor Emma,

02:31.985 --> 02:34.888
whose vote will represent
the younger students.

02:34.888 --> 02:36.590
MG is such a narc.

02:36.590 --> 02:37.724
ALARIC:
Now, I have to go off-campus.

02:37.724 --> 02:41.461
In the meantime, I expect
you to make good decisions

02:41.461 --> 02:43.730
and to vote wisely.

02:43.730 --> 02:46.199
That's all.
You're dismissed.

02:51.471 --> 02:54.374
Hi, Dr. Saltzman.

02:54.374 --> 02:56.977
Dr. Saltzman.
Dr. Saltzman.

02:56.977 --> 03:00.313
Um, is there a decision coming
about if Landon can stay here?

03:00.313 --> 03:03.250
We are running tests on him
to figure out once and for all

03:03.250 --> 03:04.618
if he's supernatural.

03:04.618 --> 03:05.886
What if the results
aren't clear?

03:05.886 --> 03:07.487
Well, then I have a
decision to make.

03:07.487 --> 03:09.523
Well, can the
honor council decide?

03:09.523 --> 03:11.591
Isn't that the point?
You know, that we have,

03:11.591 --> 03:12.993
like, a say in stuff like this?

03:12.993 --> 03:15.262
If it comes to that,
and we determine

03:15.262 --> 03:17.364
he's not a danger, then yes.

03:17.364 --> 03:18.498
Thanks.

03:18.498 --> 03:20.967
You're not gonna
regret this.

03:20.967 --> 03:21.968
Dr. Saltzman. Hey.

03:21.968 --> 03:24.004
Hi. Um, do you have a minute
to talk about Kaleb?

03:24.004 --> 03:26.039
I'm late, MG.
It's really important.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.507
30 seconds.

03:27.507 --> 03:29.042
Okay, thank you.
'Cause when I told Lizzie

03:29.042 --> 03:31.545
about how Kaleb was feeding on
the girls at the high school,

03:31.545 --> 03:32.946
I didn't think that my big mouth

03:32.946 --> 03:34.648
would get him sent
to vampire prison.

03:34.648 --> 03:36.716
Your big mouth had nothing
to do with that.

03:36.716 --> 03:38.785
Kaleb's locked up
because he needs to dry out.

03:38.785 --> 03:39.820
When young vampires
feed on humans,

03:39.820 --> 03:42.055
they become a threat not only
to innocent people,

03:42.055 --> 03:44.791
but themselves.

03:44.791 --> 03:46.927
That's cool, but, um,
I was wondering,

03:46.927 --> 03:48.962
maybe you could show him
some leniency

03:48.962 --> 03:50.997
so that the-the vamps
won't be so pissed at me?

03:50.997 --> 03:52.532
Trust me, the punishment
fits the crime.

03:52.532 --> 03:53.834
Unless, of course,
you think I'm wrong,

03:53.834 --> 03:56.069
in which case you can
feel free to bring it up

03:56.069 --> 03:57.471
at the honor
council meeting.

03:57.471 --> 03:58.672
I've got to go.

03:58.672 --> 04:00.540
O-Okay. Yeah.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.747
Are you kidding me?
: Am I under
assault today?

04:07.747 --> 04:09.583
You get to interrogate
a tree nymph,

04:09.583 --> 04:11.084
and I have to run
Landon's 23andMe.

04:11.084 --> 04:13.553
First of all,
it's a dryad, not a nymph.

04:13.553 --> 04:16.656
Second of all, I need a witch
to run the testing spells.

04:16.656 --> 04:18.625
Get Emma to do it.
She can supervise,

04:18.625 --> 04:20.494
but she's busy managing
the school in my,

04:20.494 --> 04:22.395
I'm sure, unbearable absence.

04:22.395 --> 04:23.897
Plus, if Landon
can convince you

04:23.897 --> 04:27.400
that he belongs,
he can convince anybody.

04:27.400 --> 04:30.036
You're enjoying this.
I am.

04:30.036 --> 04:30.904
Mm.

04:30.904 --> 04:33.406
I left you instructions
in my office.

04:33.406 --> 04:35.509

the election over an outfit.

04:52.392 --> 04:54.561
I'm not worried about losing
the election.

04:54.561 --> 04:57.731
I'm worried about what I'm going
to wear to my victory rally.

04:58.865 --> 05:01.001
The outfit makes the speech.

05:03.737 --> 05:05.472
How do I look?

05:05.472 --> 05:07.607
Maybe you should wear something
that shows your fellow witches

05:07.607 --> 05:09.409
you're gonna take this
seriously.

05:09.409 --> 05:10.744
It's a big responsibility.

05:10.744 --> 05:13.613
That is why I am perfect
for the job.

05:13.613 --> 05:15.949
I'm a tastemaker.

05:15.949 --> 05:17.184
An influencer.

05:17.184 --> 05:19.786
People don't really know what
they want until I tell them

05:19.786 --> 05:21.488
that they want it.

LANDON:
What are you doing here?

05:30.831 --> 05:33.066
Dr. Saltzman wanted me
to administer your tests,

05:33.066 --> 05:37.637
starting with some weird
mystical blood analysis.

05:37.637 --> 05:39.105
No.
Excuse me?

05:39.105 --> 05:40.707
No. These tests determine

05:40.707 --> 05:42.742
whether or not I get to stay
at the school, right?

05:43.810 --> 05:45.445
There is no way
I'm putting my future

05:45.445 --> 05:46.746
in your hands; you're biased.

05:46.746 --> 05:48.582
I'm not biased.

05:48.582 --> 05:50.083
Besides,
neither of us has a choice.

05:50.083 --> 05:52.185
Believe me, this is not
how I would choose

05:52.185 --> 05:53.453
to spend my day, either.

05:53.453 --> 05:54.921
See? Biased.

05:54.921 --> 05:56.790
Landon.

05:56.790 --> 05:58.792
Last thing that you told me
was that you wanted

05:58.792 --> 06:01.061
to find answers about who
or what you are.

06:02.562 --> 06:03.863
I want those answers, too.

06:03.863 --> 06:05.799
So let's just get through this.

06:05.799 --> 06:09.769
PENELOPE:
Lizzie Saltzman only cares
about Lizzie Saltzman.

06:09.769 --> 06:11.905
If your interests
don't line up with hers,

06:11.905 --> 06:13.540
you're witch non grata.

06:13.540 --> 06:14.841
I personally believe

06:14.841 --> 06:16.509
that you deserve
a better candidate.

06:16.509 --> 06:18.979
So you're running for
honor council just to spite her.

06:18.979 --> 06:22.048
That's low, Penelope,
even for you.

06:22.048 --> 06:24.184
You used to like it
when I went low.

06:24.184 --> 06:26.486
You know what I mean.

06:26.486 --> 06:28.455
You don't even like
extracurricular activities,

06:28.455 --> 06:30.957
let alone anything that
involves a moral compass.

06:30.957 --> 06:32.692
Oh, and your one-witch
ethics committee

06:32.692 --> 06:35.729
is okay with
double plagiarism?

06:35.729 --> 06:37.697
It is not like "hope"
was an option.

06:37.697 --> 06:41.701
Bow out now, or
I will crush you.

06:41.701 --> 06:43.603
Oh, honey, you crush on me.

06:43.603 --> 06:44.871
And deep down,
you know I'm right.

06:44.871 --> 06:47.007
Your sister's unfit for office.

06:48.875 --> 06:50.577
DORIAN:
We figured out the pattern.

06:50.577 --> 06:52.145
The monsters come one at a time.

06:52.145 --> 06:54.748
I already had to kill a crazy
wraith thing just to find

06:54.748 --> 06:56.149
one of you who could
communicate about why

06:56.149 --> 06:58.551
you want this knife so bad,
so it's time to talk.

06:58.551 --> 07:00.854
Why would I talk
to evil creatures who kill?

07:00.854 --> 07:02.022
Uh, anything yet?

07:02.022 --> 07:03.890
Just some light judgment.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.762
You're a dryad, right?

07:09.863 --> 07:11.898
Living spirit of a tree.

07:12.932 --> 07:15.268
Uh, it says here that, uh,

07:15.268 --> 07:18.038
dryads were gentle creatures
who lived among humans.

07:18.038 --> 07:20.507
Well, we're
not your enemy.

07:20.507 --> 07:22.709
We're just looking for answers.

07:22.709 --> 07:24.177
Humans are known to lie.

07:24.177 --> 07:25.712
So are monsters.

07:27.013 --> 07:29.616
There is a man I cherish
named Oliver.

07:29.616 --> 07:30.784
If you bring him to me,

07:30.784 --> 07:32.886
I will believe that you
are trustworthy,

07:32.886 --> 07:35.088
or what passes for it
among your species.

07:35.088 --> 07:37.057
Only then will I answer
your questions.

07:37.057 --> 07:40.727
Whoa, we're not
negotiating, right, Ric?

07:42.729 --> 07:44.164
Uh...

07:45.765 --> 07:48.201
What should we tell this Oliver?

07:52.238 --> 07:53.807
Show him this ring.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.208
It belonged to him.

07:55.208 --> 07:56.142
He will come with you.

07:59.846 --> 08:01.948
I will give no further answers
until he does.

08:01.948 --> 08:03.316
What if we don't take the deal?

08:03.316 --> 08:05.485
Trees are patient.

08:07.687 --> 08:09.789
Humans are not.

08:20.166 --> 08:22.736
All right, I got a medieval
history paper due at 2:00.

08:22.736 --> 08:23.737
Who's on that?

08:23.737 --> 08:25.105
I'll do it.

08:25.905 --> 08:28.308
But I need a favor.

08:28.308 --> 08:29.976
You've been in the
pack for five minutes,

08:29.976 --> 08:31.611
and you want a favor
from your alpha?

08:31.611 --> 08:33.847
You're obviously gonna be
elected to the honor council.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.248
If it comes down to it,

08:35.248 --> 08:37.083
will you do what you can
to keep Landon in?

08:37.083 --> 08:38.852
That's a great idea, foster kid.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.253
I'll bring that up
at the first meeting.

08:40.253 --> 08:43.623
So I can make sure
your boy gets the boot.

08:43.623 --> 08:45.625
Why?

08:45.625 --> 08:46.593
I joined the pack.

08:46.593 --> 08:48.027
Yo, I'm following all
the stupid rules that...

08:48.027 --> 08:50.363
Well, consider that
punishment...

08:50.363 --> 08:52.866
for not respecting my authority
when you got here.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.768
The rule is this:

08:54.768 --> 08:57.871
What the alpha says goes.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.973
And I say Landon goes.

09:12.252 --> 09:14.154
What magic have you employed
to search for my Oliver?

09:14.154 --> 09:16.055
It's a new spell called Google.

09:16.055 --> 09:17.690
You're mocking me.

09:17.690 --> 09:20.693
Yeah, but just a little bit.

09:20.693 --> 09:23.797
Will you open the window?
I would like to feel the breeze.

09:23.797 --> 09:26.332
Until I know the full extent
of your power, I'd rather not.

09:26.332 --> 09:28.868
You do not need to fear
that I will deceive you.

09:28.868 --> 09:30.670
Unlike humans,
dryads do not lie.

09:30.670 --> 09:31.971
We choose not to harm.

09:31.971 --> 09:34.340
Well, in the human world,

09:34.340 --> 09:39.179
sometimes telling the truth
can do more harm than good.

09:40.747 --> 09:43.817
So, who's this Oliver
that Dorian went to go find?

09:43.817 --> 09:46.052
Oliver never lied.

09:46.052 --> 09:48.088
He was not like
the other men

09:48.088 --> 09:50.290
who would come into the forest
to chop down trees

09:50.290 --> 09:52.926
so that their houses could be
bigger than other houses.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.161
He played music.

09:55.161 --> 09:58.064
He would lean against the trees
and feel happiness.

09:58.064 --> 10:00.667
We fell in love.

10:00.667 --> 10:04.704
You should know he might
not be around anymore.

10:04.704 --> 10:08.308
It's been a... a while
since those days you remember.

10:08.308 --> 10:11.044
Oliver made a great sacrifice;
he became a vampire

10:11.044 --> 10:13.179
so we might be
together forever.

10:13.179 --> 10:15.381
We decided to meet
at the clearing

10:15.381 --> 10:17.951
where we fell in love
so we could run away.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.886
But circumstance got in the way.

10:19.886 --> 10:21.754
Hmm.

10:21.754 --> 10:23.990
I feel your pain.

10:23.990 --> 10:25.758
You've also lost a great love.

10:25.758 --> 10:28.194
A psychic tree: check.

10:28.194 --> 10:31.464
Is your humor helpful
in avoiding your pain?

10:31.464 --> 10:34.100
Not really, no.

10:34.100 --> 10:36.769
You carry more than one loss.

10:36.769 --> 10:38.071
Several.

10:38.071 --> 10:40.139
Including the mother
of my children.

10:41.975 --> 10:45.979
But there's
happiness there, too.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.882
I see it in their smiles,

10:48.882 --> 10:52.018
in their laughter.

10:52.018 --> 10:55.321
I still see her sometimes.

10:59.759 --> 11:01.294
DORIAN:
Good news, bad news.

11:01.294 --> 11:03.429
Our pal Bonnie did
her witch thing on the ring.

11:03.429 --> 11:06.432
Some sort of combo summoning
spell and astral projection,

11:06.432 --> 11:07.667
so...

11:09.168 --> 11:11.704
Can someone please tell me
what's going on here?

11:13.806 --> 11:15.074
Oliver.

11:21.314 --> 11:23.783
I'm sorry, do I know you?

11:26.920 --> 11:29.989
I'm guessing
that's the bad news.

11:29.989 --> 11:31.824
:
Yeah.

11:37.931 --> 11:39.265
Hey, I'm doing it.

11:39.265 --> 11:41.034
Now what?
Hold it for ten minutes.

11:42.468 --> 11:44.938
What

11:50.143 --> 11:51.444
You can stop.

11:51.444 --> 11:54.847
You failed. You have
no supernatural strength.

11:54.847 --> 11:56.516
What's next?
Next?

11:56.516 --> 11:58.885
You failed the vertical climb,
the long jump,

11:58.885 --> 12:01.521
and you straight-up refused
to swim across the lake.

12:01.521 --> 12:02.956
Yeah, well,
excuse the foster kid

12:02.956 --> 12:03.957
for never having swim lessons.

12:03.957 --> 12:05.058
Look,

12:05.058 --> 12:06.326
I might suck at-at...

12:06.326 --> 12:07.860
everything, apparently,

12:07.860 --> 12:10.196
but I only have
to pass one test to stay,

12:10.196 --> 12:11.831
so I'm not giving up yet.

12:11.831 --> 12:13.199
How's it going?

12:14.300 --> 12:16.269
Landon was about
to run sprints

12:16.269 --> 12:18.238
to the lake and back.

12:21.174 --> 12:22.942
What are you testing for,
exactly?

12:22.942 --> 12:25.845
His ability to get away
from me as quickly as possible.

12:25.845 --> 12:28.314
If he's gonna stay
in this school, it's a must.

12:28.314 --> 12:30.216
Did you run the lineage
spell that I left you?

12:30.216 --> 12:33.386
Yeah, first thing.
Zero magic in his bloodline.

12:33.386 --> 12:34.554
Hmm.

12:34.554 --> 12:35.221
Hmm?

12:35.221 --> 12:37.423
Most humans have some trace

12:37.423 --> 12:40.226
of magical blood in their veins
from a far-flung ancestor.

12:40.226 --> 12:42.495
So what does that mean?

12:42.495 --> 12:45.298
We need to learn more
about Landon's past.

12:46.366 --> 12:47.533
HOPE:
What's your name?

12:47.533 --> 12:50.069
Landon Kirby.

12:50.069 --> 12:52.572
See? That's the truth.

12:52.572 --> 12:54.374
Now lie.

12:54.374 --> 12:56.442
What's your favorite food?

12:56.442 --> 12:57.543
Rabbit.

12:59.512 --> 13:00.947
So it's a...

13:00.947 --> 13:02.615
supernatural lie detector.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.283
Pretty much
your worst nightmare.

13:04.283 --> 13:05.918
Bring it on, Hope.

13:06.953 --> 13:08.321
Where were you born?

13:08.321 --> 13:10.256
I don't know.

13:13.026 --> 13:14.427
Who are your parents?

13:14.427 --> 13:16.996
My mom's name is Seylah.

13:16.996 --> 13:18.598
That's pretty much all I know.

13:18.598 --> 13:20.600
She gave me up for adoption
when I was young.

13:20.600 --> 13:23.936
And your dad?
Never met him.

13:26.639 --> 13:29.442
Why can't you be compelled?
I have no idea.

13:29.442 --> 13:31.878
A couple days ago, I didn't
even know what compulsion was.

13:33.079 --> 13:34.313
Why'd you take the knife?

13:34.313 --> 13:36.315
I don't know. I don't...
I remember doing it,

13:36.315 --> 13:37.550
but I don't remember why.

13:38.451 --> 13:39.552
It's not good enough.

13:39.552 --> 13:41.454
If we can't figure
out what you are,

13:41.454 --> 13:43.556
then you can't stay
at this school.

13:46.359 --> 13:50.229
This is such an honor.

13:51.130 --> 13:53.132
It's so nice

13:53.132 --> 13:55.501
to know that you all love me

13:55.501 --> 13:57.236
as much as I thought you did.

13:57.236 --> 13:59.238
Hey, Lizzie,
before you go

13:59.238 --> 14:01.641
too far down the road of victory
speeches, I talked to Serena

14:01.641 --> 14:03.910
and her goth coven. She said
that they would vote for you,

14:03.910 --> 14:05.011
but they just
wanted to make sure

14:05.011 --> 14:07.246
that you would allow time off
for pagan holidays.

14:07.246 --> 14:08.915
Right.

14:11.918 --> 14:14.020
Hey, Raf.
Hey, Jo.

14:14.020 --> 14:15.555
Welcome to
the winner's circle.

14:15.555 --> 14:17.190
How's it going with Jackass Jed?

14:17.190 --> 14:18.624
I mean, do you need
any more advice

14:18.624 --> 14:20.293
on how to deal
with Cro

14:20.293 --> 14:22.428
That's actually
why I'm here.

14:23.963 --> 14:25.331
Lizzie.
Hey.

14:25.331 --> 14:26.933
You got a sec?

14:26.933 --> 14:27.934
I have a lot of secs.

14:29.235 --> 14:33.005
I mean... time.

14:33.005 --> 14:35.541
The honor council might get
to decide if Landon can stay.

14:35.541 --> 14:37.276
Emma won't say
how she's gonna vote,

14:37.276 --> 14:38.945
but I talked to MG,

14:38.945 --> 14:41.414
and he's the only vampire
running, and he's on board.

14:41.414 --> 14:42.648
And because everybody knows

14:42.648 --> 14:44.317
that you're gonna get
the witch vote, I...

14:44.317 --> 14:45.318
Say no more.

14:45.318 --> 14:46.953
I know how much

14:46.953 --> 14:48.488
Landon means to you,

14:48.488 --> 14:51.023
and I would be happy to help.

14:51.023 --> 14:52.291
I mean, all right. Thank you.

14:52.291 --> 14:53.526
Seriously.

14:53.526 --> 14:55.428
Oh, if-if you would, um,

14:55.428 --> 14:57.263
be happy to...

14:57.263 --> 15:00.032
be my date to my birthday
on Friday?

15:05.138 --> 15:06.439
Are you blackmailing me?

15:06.439 --> 15:08.441
:
No, silly.

15:08.441 --> 15:10.476
I'm black-tie'ing you.

15:10.476 --> 15:12.445
It's totally different.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.419
Sure.

15:21.254 --> 15:24.123
Whatever.

15:37.036 --> 15:39.038
What up, Kaleb?

15:39.038 --> 15:40.373
The hell you want, man?

15:40.373 --> 15:43.009
I, uh... I-I copped this
from the kitchen.

15:44.243 --> 15:45.545
I thought you might be hungry.

15:45.545 --> 15:48.347
Not for bunny blood.

15:48.347 --> 15:49.749
It's the only blood
in the school, man.

15:49.749 --> 15:51.751
Then hunger strike
it is, I guess.

15:51.751 --> 15:54.654
I'm sorry that you're in here,
but let me make it up to you.

15:54.654 --> 15:56.656
Dr. Saltzman is starting
an honor council.

15:56.656 --> 15:58.791
And if I get elected,
I can change things around here,

15:58.791 --> 16:01.260
starting with getting you
out of this cell.

16:01.260 --> 16:03.329
Mm. You'd do that for me?

16:03.329 --> 16:04.530
Yeah, of course.

16:04.530 --> 16:06.465
Well, all right.

16:06.465 --> 16:08.367
Send the vamps my way.

16:08.367 --> 16:10.136
I'll get 'em in line.

16:10.136 --> 16:12.271
Thanks, man.
Hey, you won't regret this.

16:12.271 --> 16:13.506
I promise.

16:16.642 --> 16:18.044
Okay.

16:18.044 --> 16:19.445
JED:
We'll blow out these walls,

16:19.445 --> 16:21.447
get a full-sized
basketball court in here.

16:21.447 --> 16:23.482
They haven't touched
this place since...

16:23.482 --> 16:25.184
We need to talk, Jed.

16:25.184 --> 16:26.252
We already did.

16:26.252 --> 16:27.486
Just hear me out.

16:27.486 --> 16:29.555
I've got the vampires
and the witches.

16:29.555 --> 16:32.158
But I need one more faction
to make sure.

16:32.158 --> 16:34.527
Be nice to know
I could count on my own pack.

16:34.527 --> 16:37.096
Yeah, see,
that's the thing, Raf.

16:37.096 --> 16:38.798
They're not your pack.

16:38.798 --> 16:41.634
They're mine.

16:43.369 --> 16:46.472
Thought you might say that.

16:48.741 --> 16:49.675
All right.

16:49.675 --> 16:51.277
I've actually been studying
all those books

16:51.277 --> 16:53.446
you make other people
read for you.

16:53.446 --> 16:56.148
Like Intro to Lycanthropy.

16:56.148 --> 16:58.851
An alpha has to face
a challenger one-on-one.

16:58.851 --> 17:01.087
I didn't want
to do things this way.

17:01.087 --> 17:03.155
But if what the alpha says
goes...

17:04.457 --> 17:06.425
...I got to be the alpha.

EMMA:
All right.

18:43.222 --> 18:45.491
Voting is now closed.

18:46.692 --> 18:48.627
Let's get started.

18:57.303 --> 18:59.939
The werewolf representative
will be...

18:59.939 --> 19:01.440
Rafael.

19:05.678 --> 19:07.880
So much for not wanting
anything to do with the pack.

19:07.880 --> 19:10.416
I've always wanted to be
part of a power couple.

19:11.817 --> 19:13.619
EMMA: All right,
settle down.

19:13.619 --> 19:15.421
Thank you.

19:15.421 --> 19:16.622
Next up...

19:21.727 --> 19:23.896
The vampire representative

19:23.896 --> 19:25.398
will be...

19:25.398 --> 19:26.465
Kaleb.

19:29.468 --> 19:31.370
All right, guys.

19:31.370 --> 19:32.772
Settle down!

19:32.772 --> 19:35.441
Thank you.

19:35.441 --> 19:37.710
Showtime.
How do I look?

19:37.710 --> 19:40.613
EMMA: And the witch
representative will be...

19:40.613 --> 19:42.782
Josie.

19:45.651 --> 19:47.653
Thank you all
for voting.

19:47.653 --> 19:52.291
And congratulations to our
newly elected representatives.

19:54.560 --> 19:55.895
There were so many
in that grove.

19:55.895 --> 19:57.730
Do you not remember any of us?

19:58.664 --> 20:00.266
ALARIC:
But she knew you.

20:00.266 --> 20:02.435
She knows your name,
that you're a vampire.

20:02.435 --> 20:04.703
I'm not sure
what's going on here, but...

20:05.938 --> 20:07.406
...we've never met before.

20:10.376 --> 20:13.279
In the forest, there was
a clearing next to the river.

20:13.279 --> 20:15.548
The bed would blossom
with daffodils every spring.

20:15.548 --> 20:18.384
Yeah, I walk there every day.

20:18.384 --> 20:20.619
It's where I proposed
to my wife.

20:21.654 --> 20:23.355
You are married.

20:23.355 --> 20:24.356
Yeah.

20:26.425 --> 20:28.828
Why did you ask me
about the clearing?

20:37.736 --> 20:39.805
I'm sorry.

20:41.474 --> 20:42.641
I made a mistake.

20:42.641 --> 20:45.010
I thought you were someone else.

20:48.781 --> 20:51.750
You said you'd help me
get answers.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.352
I didn't even want to do this.

20:53.352 --> 20:55.087
Don't blame me
because you're not special.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.623
I apologized for lying to you.

20:57.623 --> 20:59.625
I explained
why I took the knife.

20:59.625 --> 21:01.494
Why are you still so mad at me?

21:01.494 --> 21:02.628
I'm not mad.

21:02.628 --> 21:04.430
I couldn't care less.

21:08.734 --> 21:10.636
Fine. It's easier to be mad.

21:10.636 --> 21:12.338
Why?
Because it is.

21:12.338 --> 21:14.039
Or maybe it's because you feel
like if you stop being mad,

21:14.039 --> 21:15.774
you're letting your guard down,
and the legendary Hope Mikaelson

21:15.774 --> 21:17.343
couldn't possibly do that.

21:17.343 --> 21:19.879
When I let my guard down,
people disappoint me.

21:26.385 --> 21:28.754
Growing up
in the foster system...

21:29.922 --> 21:31.957
...every time
I got sent someplace new,

21:31.957 --> 21:34.660
I'd hope that this
would be the right place.

21:34.660 --> 21:36.495
You know, like, uh,

21:36.495 --> 21:37.730
"click your heels three times,"

21:37.730 --> 21:39.498
"no place like home"
kind of stuff.

21:41.100 --> 21:44.370
Just somewhere
I actually belonged.

21:44.370 --> 21:45.971
But it never was.

21:45.971 --> 21:48.774
You know, and you can only
hold out hope for so long

21:48.774 --> 21:50.509
and-and be hurt
by so many people

21:50.509 --> 21:53.812
before its starts
to seems impossible

21:53.812 --> 21:55.814
to trust someone new.

21:55.814 --> 21:58.551
Especially when they lie to you.

21:58.551 --> 22:01.086
So, for the last time,

22:01.086 --> 22:03.489
I'm sorry.

22:03.489 --> 22:06.058
I broke your trust.

22:06.058 --> 22:08.794
I don't want to do it again.

22:12.097 --> 22:14.400
Thank you.

22:14.400 --> 22:19.538
But if this goes the wrong way,
can you just make sure

22:19.538 --> 22:22.841
that Raf doesn't, um,
follow me this time?

22:22.841 --> 22:25.411
As much as I want
to stay here, he needs to.

22:25.411 --> 22:27.513
He finally found a home
he deserves.

22:30.015 --> 22:32.117
I'm not gonna
take that away from him.

22:44.496 --> 22:46.632
Oh.

22:46.632 --> 22:48.734
Hey, Jed.

22:48.734 --> 22:50.970
You don't belong here.

22:52.438 --> 22:55.140
Yeah.
Everyone keeps saying that.

22:55.140 --> 22:58.010
Everything was fine before
you and Rafael showed up.

22:59.578 --> 23:00.746
Wait, wait.

23:37.683 --> 23:39.485
I'm gonna tear Jed apart.

23:39.485 --> 23:41.487
HOPE:
No, you're really not.

23:43.155 --> 23:45.691
He's gonna pay for what he did.

23:45.691 --> 23:46.959
He could've killed him.

23:46.959 --> 23:48.661
You want to do something
to help him?

23:48.661 --> 23:51.163
Take a walk to the herb garden
and get me some hazelwood root.

23:56.702 --> 23:58.570
What does hazelwood root do?

23:58.570 --> 24:02.074
Make him cool off before
he realizes that I made it up.

24:04.943 --> 24:09.114
Raf's had a...
a rough couple of weeks.

24:09.114 --> 24:12.117
Look who's talking.

24:12.117 --> 24:14.820
Guess we can cross "supernatural
healing" off the list.

24:20.092 --> 24:23.028
I'm sorry
that this happened to you.

24:25.531 --> 24:27.199
Jed's one of those rare cases

24:27.199 --> 24:30.302
where his bite is actually worse
than his bark.

24:30.302 --> 24:32.604
I've dealt with bullies before.

24:32.604 --> 24:34.573
Not like this.

24:34.573 --> 24:38.110
I know how badly you
want to stay here,

24:38.110 --> 24:41.947
but this school is full
of people like Jed.

24:41.947 --> 24:45.718
Some of us are nicer,
some of us have more control,

24:45.718 --> 24:48.921
but all of us are capable
of doing what he did.

24:51.023 --> 24:53.792
Do you honestly think
that you're safe here?

24:53.792 --> 24:56.195
Yes, I do.

25:00.632 --> 25:02.634
You should rest.

25:09.708 --> 25:11.276
Can I...

25:11.276 --> 25:12.878
Shh.

25:12.878 --> 25:14.113
...get you anything?

25:14.113 --> 25:16.148
I said, "Shh."

25:16.148 --> 25:19.151
I'm trying...

25:19.151 --> 25:21.854
to rise above it.

25:21.854 --> 25:24.623
So let me freaking rise.

25:27.226 --> 25:30.295
Okay, I don't know why Penelope
had them vote for me.

25:30.295 --> 25:32.631
It doesn't make any sense.

25:33.799 --> 25:36.001
What's done is done, Jo.

25:36.001 --> 25:37.369
Well, I can step down,
and then they'd

25:37.369 --> 25:38.871
have to go with
the runner-up.

25:38.871 --> 25:41.073
Great minds think alike.

25:41.073 --> 25:43.142
I already asked Emma
if we could do that.

25:43.142 --> 25:45.043
And Emma said no?

25:45.043 --> 25:46.812
Well, then we can ask Dad.

25:46.812 --> 25:48.313
She said yes,

25:48.313 --> 25:50.716
except...

25:50.716 --> 25:54.319
it turns out...

25:54.319 --> 25:57.790
I wasn't the runner-up, either.

25:59.058 --> 26:01.260
Let me guess.
There's been a mistake.

26:01.260 --> 26:05.063
I won the popular vote,
but not the electoral college.

26:05.063 --> 26:06.698
No.

26:06.698 --> 26:09.701
You won fair and square,
besides the part

26:09.701 --> 26:11.370
where you stabbed me
in the back.

26:11.370 --> 26:14.072
Ooh.

26:14.072 --> 26:16.241
Doesn't feel too good, does it?

26:16.241 --> 26:18.710
Emma sent me
to come and get you.

26:18.710 --> 26:20.779
Okay.

26:27.252 --> 26:29.121
I only wanted to be elected

26:29.121 --> 26:31.089
so that I could fix things
between us.

26:31.089 --> 26:32.724
You did.

26:32.724 --> 26:34.159
We're even now.

26:36.061 --> 26:37.362
How's the interrogation going?

26:37.362 --> 26:38.997
ALARIC:
She's not talking.

26:38.997 --> 26:40.732
But I think I figured out

26:40.732 --> 26:42.935
why no one remembers dragons,
gargoyles or dryads existing.

26:42.935 --> 26:45.037
I mean, whatever happened
to these creatures,

26:45.037 --> 26:46.839
it erased all memory of them.

26:46.839 --> 26:49.141
It's like they never existed
in the first place.

26:49.141 --> 26:50.442
I guess that explains a lot.

26:50.442 --> 26:52.144
Well, don't sound so excited.

26:52.144 --> 26:54.780
It's only a massive piece
of the puzzle that explains why

26:54.780 --> 26:57.683
these creatures only exist
in legends and myths.

26:57.683 --> 26:59.051
Sorry. I'm just

26:59.051 --> 27:00.385
having a day.

27:00.385 --> 27:02.754
Listen, I want a seat
on the council.

27:02.754 --> 27:05.157
I'm a tribrid--
the only one of my kind.

27:05.157 --> 27:07.192
No one can represent
my interests but me.

27:07.192 --> 27:09.328
Is this about Landon?

27:09.328 --> 27:11.396
Because you can't
let this get personal.

27:11.396 --> 27:13.465
The political is personal.

27:13.465 --> 27:16.268
I learned that in
Advanced Civics, taught by you.

27:16.268 --> 27:18.303
That's cheating.

27:18.303 --> 27:20.806
But I trust
that you'll make the right call.

27:31.950 --> 27:33.218
It's been hours.

27:33.218 --> 27:34.786
She's not gonna
tell us anything.

27:47.966 --> 27:50.135
Oh, that feels nice.

27:50.135 --> 27:52.037
Thank you, Alaric.

27:52.037 --> 27:55.307
From somebody who has lost
exactly what you lost today...

27:56.909 --> 27:58.944
...I'm sorry.

27:58.944 --> 28:01.213
I will honor our deal.

28:01.213 --> 28:03.315
What do you wish to know?

28:11.890 --> 28:13.959
Sorry I'm late.

28:13.959 --> 28:16.061
Hold up. Who voted for her?

28:16.061 --> 28:17.396
I ran unopposed.

28:31.076 --> 28:33.278
We're here to discuss
if Landon should be allowed

28:33.278 --> 28:34.479
to stay at the school.

28:34.479 --> 28:37.215
My vote,
on behalf of the lower school,

28:37.215 --> 28:40.419
is to err on the side
of inclusion.

28:40.419 --> 28:43.488
We exist to help kids like him.

28:46.925 --> 28:49.528
Which is what I'm going
to go do now.

28:49.528 --> 28:52.164
I have a search party out
looking for Jed.

28:52.164 --> 28:53.365
As you've all seen,

28:53.365 --> 28:55.867
violence leads to more violence.

28:55.867 --> 28:57.836
If you'll excuse me.

29:00.572 --> 29:03.909
All right, who wants to start?

29:04.977 --> 29:06.478
Landon has to go.

29:15.921 --> 29:19.891
Never thought I'd be saying
this, but... Hope's right.

29:19.891 --> 29:22.327
Humans refuse to make a place
for us in their world.

29:22.327 --> 29:24.129
We start letting them in,

29:24.129 --> 29:26.031
it's only a matter of time

29:26.031 --> 29:28.000
before they take this place
from us, too.

29:37.042 --> 29:38.910
Landon goes.

29:40.112 --> 29:41.780
Landon is my brother.

29:43.315 --> 29:46.284
He's the only reason I'm alive.

29:46.284 --> 29:47.519
He can't go back
to human life

29:47.519 --> 29:50.122
knowing that magic
and dragons exist.

29:50.122 --> 29:53.425
We took his whole
crappy life from him.

29:55.060 --> 29:59.097
Be awful selfish of us not
to give him one to replace it.

30:06.238 --> 30:08.640
That's two-one.

30:08.640 --> 30:11.376
Doesn't matter how much
we want him to stay.

30:11.376 --> 30:13.412
Look what one mad wolf did
to him.

30:13.412 --> 30:16.515
Earlier, I asked him
if he felt safe here.

30:17.983 --> 30:19.551
He said "yes."

30:27.159 --> 30:29.394
He was lying.

30:31.063 --> 30:34.633
This place is dangerous for him,
and even he knows it.

30:34.633 --> 30:37.869
I will protect him.
And where were you an hour ago?

30:39.137 --> 30:41.139
That's the point.

30:41.139 --> 30:44.910
If he stays, it's on all of us.

30:44.910 --> 30:47.312
It is all of our responsibility
to protect him.

30:47.312 --> 30:49.081
Can we honestly

30:49.081 --> 30:52.350
say we believe
every one of us can handle

30:52.350 --> 30:54.853
that kind of
a responsibility?

31:07.032 --> 31:09.901
KALEB:
Two to two. Looks like
it's on you, Josie.

31:11.203 --> 31:14.106
DRYAD:
The night I was to
leave with Oliver,

31:14.106 --> 31:17.042
something attacked me, and I
woke up in an endless darkness.

31:17.042 --> 31:18.944
I could feel the presence
of others,

31:18.944 --> 31:21.313
but not see or hear them.

31:21.313 --> 31:24.082
I was there for so long,
and then, just as suddenly,

31:24.082 --> 31:26.084
I found myself not
far from here.

31:26.084 --> 31:28.353
With an urge
to possess that knife.

31:28.353 --> 31:30.355
Why

31:30.355 --> 31:31.690
I do not know.

31:31.690 --> 31:34.226
Only that I must have it.

31:34.226 --> 31:36.061
It's like something...

31:36.061 --> 31:39.464
something pressing inside me,
telling me to take it.

31:39.464 --> 31:40.932
Take it where?

31:42.234 --> 31:44.402
There is a dark pit
beneath the earth.

31:44.402 --> 31:45.604
Locked away.

31:45.604 --> 31:48.039
I can see it. I can feel it.

31:48.039 --> 31:49.741
I am meant to take
the knife there.

31:49.741 --> 31:52.344
If I do, I will find peace
and finally be free.

31:52.344 --> 31:53.612
And who told you to do this?

31:53.612 --> 31:56.348
A voice in my mind.

31:56.348 --> 31:58.183
It is still there.

31:58.183 --> 32:00.485
I tried to fight it,
but I am not strong enough.

32:03.355 --> 32:05.123
I'm sorry. I have no choice.

32:05.123 --> 32:06.758
Watch out.

32:12.497 --> 32:13.632
Dorian, the knife.

32:30.482 --> 32:32.617
Take me to the daffodils.

32:32.617 --> 32:34.586
Take me home.

32:34.586 --> 32:36.254
Take me, please.

32:49.167 --> 32:51.169
Josie.

32:51.169 --> 32:52.671
Please.

32:54.573 --> 32:56.575
Since Landon walked
through those doors,

32:56.575 --> 32:59.544
my sister, my father and I
have almost died.

32:59.544 --> 33:02.480
We don't really know
what Landon is,

33:02.480 --> 33:05.617
so we can't really say if we
know if he's dangerous or not.

33:05.617 --> 33:07.519
Raf, this isn't about

33:07.519 --> 33:10.055
who's friends with who
or who you like.

33:10.055 --> 33:12.290
This school is family,

33:12.290 --> 33:15.594
and I am not putting my family
in danger again.

33:19.798 --> 33:21.700
Raf.

33:23.368 --> 33:25.170
Raf, stop.

33:25.170 --> 33:27.706
You know what, I'm done
with both of y'all.

33:36.181 --> 33:38.116
Watch your head.

33:44.823 --> 33:49.694
I was wrong about you... Dorian.

33:49.694 --> 33:52.864
You kept your word.

33:52.864 --> 33:55.233
Not all humans lie.

33:55.233 --> 33:57.636
It's okay.

33:57.636 --> 34:00.505
I wish more monsters
were like you.

34:00.505 --> 34:02.774
I remembered something else.

34:02.774 --> 34:05.377
That black pit,

34:05.377 --> 34:07.879
that awful place,

34:07.879 --> 34:11.216
it is called Malivore.

34:11.216 --> 34:13.451
Malivore.

34:13.451 --> 34:15.387
Thank you.

34:18.390 --> 34:20.258
I'm sorry this happened.

You want to take its place?

Don't blame me.

It's the rest of the witches

36:15.407 --> 36:17.275
who knew how bad you'd be
at that job.

What did I ever do

36:20.612 --> 36:22.614
to make you hate me so much?

36:22.614 --> 36:24.382
It's not about you.

36:25.550 --> 36:27.018
Shocking, I know.

36:27.018 --> 36:30.422
It's about how you treat Josie.

36:30.422 --> 36:33.725
I love Josie.

36:33.725 --> 36:36.361
Did you think to ask her

36:36.361 --> 36:38.263
if she wanted to run
for the council

36:38.263 --> 36:40.432
before you assumed you'd win?

36:40.432 --> 36:42.567
You've left her
with no room for herself.

36:42.567 --> 36:46.438
She spends all of her energy
taking care of you.

36:46.438 --> 36:48.907
She doesn't have time
for a relationship

36:48.907 --> 36:53.411
because you are a black hole
of time and energy

36:53.411 --> 36:55.914
and love,
just sucking it all up.

36:55.914 --> 36:58.550
Never giving
any of it back.

36:58.550 --> 37:01.453
Oh, she won't ever
burn your world down.

37:02.721 --> 37:04.889
So I will do it for her.

37:19.003 --> 37:20.572
Dissulta.

37:28.880 --> 37:31.049
LANDON: Thanks for walking me.
HOPE: Yeah.

37:31.049 --> 37:35.487
LANDON: I had to go before
Rafael tried to follow me again.

37:35.487 --> 37:38.323
We didn't take the vote lightly.
It was close.

37:38.323 --> 37:40.024
Yeah, I don't really
need to hear about that.

37:40.024 --> 37:41.893
I'm in enough pain as it is.

37:42.794 --> 37:44.929
I voted no.
Yeah.

37:44.929 --> 37:48.266
Didn't need to know that.

37:49.934 --> 37:51.636
Why, exactly?

37:51.636 --> 37:53.004
Remember when you asked me
to make sure

37:53.004 --> 37:54.506
that Raf didn't follow you?

37:54.506 --> 37:57.375
You did it 'cause you care
about him, because...

37:57.375 --> 38:00.979
you wanted to do
what was right for him.

38:00.979 --> 38:02.981
Even though it was hard.

38:02.981 --> 38:06.651
Is that your way
of admitting you care about me?

38:07.719 --> 38:09.921
Maybe I'm a little biased.

38:24.936 --> 38:26.771
New Orleans.

38:26.771 --> 38:29.474
I have a family friend there
that's expecting you.

38:30.975 --> 38:34.846
I asked him to help you find
your birth mom.

38:34.846 --> 38:36.414
What?

38:36.414 --> 38:38.817
I couldn't get you
the answers that you wanted,

38:38.817 --> 38:40.785
but he can.

38:40.785 --> 38:42.554
With this.

38:42.554 --> 38:44.789
I put the results
of your lineage spell in there.

38:44.789 --> 38:46.925
And, um, some money.

38:46.925 --> 38:48.426
And a sandwich.

38:48.426 --> 38:51.596
I hope you like ham.

38:53.431 --> 38:54.899
Thank you.

38:55.833 --> 38:57.101
Yeah.

38:57.101 --> 38:59.971
Oh, and, um... and this.

38:59.971 --> 39:02.106
What is this?

39:02.106 --> 39:03.741
Think of it like a...

39:03.741 --> 39:06.511
"click your heels together
three times" kind of thing.

39:06.511 --> 39:09.080
If you ever need me,
just press it, and my bracelet

39:09.080 --> 39:11.382
will lead me to you.

39:20.592 --> 39:22.594
I should go.

39:23.695 --> 39:25.096
Okay.

39:26.164 --> 39:27.932
Bye.

39:27.932 --> 39:30.034
Bye, Landon.

39:42.013 --> 39:43.715
I wanted to see if it worked.

40:37.869 --> 40:39.537
I thought that Josie
would vote with you.

40:39.537 --> 40:41.539
I don't know what happened.
Other than that,

40:41.539 --> 40:44.275
