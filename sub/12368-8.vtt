IS RECORDED IN FRONT

00:03.002 --> 00:05.547
OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:05.630 --> 00:07.215
HI!

00:07.298 --> 00:08.967
MELANIE MORETTI,
COLUMNIST FOR <i> WOMAN'S DAY.</i>

00:09.050 --> 00:11.261
GOOD GAME, EVERYBODY.

00:11.344 --> 00:15.432
- GOOD GAME?
THEY LOST BY 20 POINTS.

00:15.515 --> 00:16.766
- YES, BUT THEY WERE VERY GOOD
ABOUT SHARING THE BALL

00:16.850 --> 00:18.768
WITH THE OTHER TEAM.

00:18.852 --> 00:22.605
- THOSE ARE FUMBLES.

00:22.689 --> 00:24.774
- [gasp] OH, WOW.
WHO'S THAT?

00:24.858 --> 00:26.943
- JIMMY ARMSTRONG.

00:27.026 --> 00:28.278
HE DOESN'T HAVE MUCH
UPSTAIRS,

00:28.361 --> 00:31.281
BUT HE'S GOT PLENTY
DOWN BELOW.

00:31.364 --> 00:33.616
- ELKA.

00:33.700 --> 00:35.326
- HE'S CLEVELAND'S KICKER.

00:35.410 --> 00:37.954
WHAT DID YOU THINK I MEANT?

00:38.037 --> 00:39.789
YO, JIMMY.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.166
SHE WANTS TO INTERVIEW YOU.

00:41.249 --> 00:42.417
- OH, HEY.
SURE THING.

00:42.500 --> 00:44.627
- HI, MELANIE MORETTI.
<i>WOMAN'S DAY.</i>

00:44.711 --> 00:46.171
I'M WRITING AN ARTICLE
ABOUT DOING THINGS

00:46.254 --> 00:47.756
OUTSIDE YOUR COMFORT ZONE.

00:47.839 --> 00:49.591
AND I'M...

00:49.674 --> 00:51.134
UNCOMFORTABLE
IN A FOOTBALL LOCKER ROOM

00:51.217 --> 00:53.636
WITH A LOT OF NAKED MEN.

00:53.720 --> 00:57.223
- I'M COMFORTABLE WITH IT.

00:57.307 --> 00:58.433
- ARE YOU A WRITER TOO?

00:58.516 --> 01:00.310
- NO, NO,
NEXT WEEK IS HER BIRTHDAY,

01:00.393 --> 01:01.644
AND THIS IS MY GIFT TO HER.

01:01.728 --> 01:03.521
- OH, HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MA'AM.

01:03.605 --> 01:04.772
- OH, THANK YOU.

01:04.855 --> 01:06.983
I'M GONNA BE 90.

01:07.066 --> 01:09.819
CAN I...SQUEEZE YOUR CHEST?

01:09.903 --> 01:13.281
- OKAY, YEAH.

01:13.364 --> 01:15.658
- OOH.

01:15.742 --> 01:17.160
- SO YOU'RE CLEVELAND'S
KICKER.

01:17.243 --> 01:20.038
- YEAH, WHICH IS FUNNY BECAUSE
MY NAME IS JIMMY ARMSTRONG.

01:20.121 --> 01:21.498
BEING THE KICKER,
YOU THINK IT WOULD BE--

01:21.581 --> 01:22.832
- LEGSTRONG.

01:22.916 --> 01:27.128
- I WAS GONNA SAY KICKGUY.
- YOURS WORKS TOO.

01:27.212 --> 01:29.506
- I'M GONNA GO BROWSING.

01:29.589 --> 01:35.178
I'M 90, CAN I SQUEEZE
YOUR CHEST?

01:35.261 --> 01:36.679
- SO I SAW ON THE JUMBOTRON

01:36.763 --> 01:38.640
THAT YOU JUST BROKE THE TEAM
RECORD FOR POINTS SCORED.

01:38.723 --> 01:40.350
YEAH, WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE
THE BALL THAT I KICKED

01:40.433 --> 01:42.852
TO BREAK THE RECORD?
- SURE, LOVE TO.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.854
- RUSTY, THROW ME THAT BALL.
WHOA, DUCK!

01:44.938 --> 01:47.148
- WHOA! AHH!

01:56.741 --> 01:59.869
{\an8}- YOUR NAME IS MELANIE.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.913
{\an8}THE YEAR IS 2011.

02:01.996 --> 02:07.502
{\an8}- 2012.
- 2012.

02:07.585 --> 02:09.838
{\an8}- WHY ARE YOU TALKING TO ME
LIKE THAT?

02:09.920 --> 02:11.714
{\an8}- SHE THINKS THE BLOW TO YOUR
HEAD HAS GIVEN YOU AMNESIA.

02:11.798 --> 02:14.717
{\an8}- DESPITE EVERYTHING I'VE SAID
TO THE CONTRARY.

02:14.801 --> 02:16.719
{\an8}- WELL, IT HAPPENED TO ME
THREE TIMES ON <i> EDGE OF TOMORROW.</i>

02:16.803 --> 02:20.557
{\an8}SO I THINK I KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

02:20.640 --> 02:21.724
{\an8}- I WENT TO HARVARD
MEDICAL SCHOOL.

02:21.808 --> 02:25.520
{\an8}- HMM. I WON A DAYTIME EMMY.

02:25.603 --> 02:28.106
{\an8}WELL, SINCE SHE'S ALREADY HERE,
ISN'T THERE SOMETHING ELSE

02:28.189 --> 02:30.233
{\an8}THAT SHE CAN HAVE DONE
THAT'S COVERED BY INSURANCE?

02:30.316 --> 02:32.110
{\an8}MAYBE SOME BOTOX OR...

02:32.193 --> 02:33.736
{\an8}I DON'T KNOW,
A CHEMICAL PEEL?

02:33.820 --> 02:37.448
{\an8}HEY, MAYBE CHEMICAL PEELS
ALL AROUND.

02:37.532 --> 02:40.243
{\an8}- WELL, WE DID JUST GET A NEW
CT MEDICAL SCANNER.

02:40.326 --> 02:43.079
{\an8}IT GIVES A COMPLETE PHYSICAL
IN JUST FIVE MINUTES.

02:43.162 --> 02:44.914
{\an8}I'VE BEEN DYING TO GIVE
THAT BABY A SPIN.

02:44.998 --> 02:48.126
{\an8}- NOT ME.
I'VE NEVER HAD A PHYSICAL.

02:48.209 --> 02:51.087
{\an8}- NEVER HAD A PHYSICAL?
THAT'S CRAZY.

02:51.170 --> 02:53.256
{\an8}YOU MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING WRONG
THEY CAN GIVE YOU PILLS FOR

02:53.339 --> 02:57.260
{\an8}THAT I CAN SNEAK INTO YOUR
BATHROOM AND STEAL.

02:57.343 --> 02:59.929
- I'M AFRAID OF WHAT
THEY MIGHT FIND.

03:00.013 --> 03:02.599
AND UNLIKE YOU, I DON'T LIKE
BEING POKED AND PRODDED

03:02.682 --> 03:06.227
BY STRANGERS.

03:06.311 --> 03:08.646
- DON'T BE A 90-YEAR-OLD BABY.
I'LL DO IT WITH YOU.

03:08.730 --> 03:11.649
- [knocking]

03:11.733 --> 03:14.944
KNOCK, KNOCK!

03:15.028 --> 03:16.404
I KNOW I KNOCKED OUTSIDE,

03:16.487 --> 03:17.655
BUT I LIKE SAYING "KNOCK, KNOCK"
IN CASE SOME OF YOU

03:17.739 --> 03:19.240
DIDN'T HEAR ME.

03:19.324 --> 03:20.950
IT'S KIND OF MY THING.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.952
- OH, MY GOD.
JIMMY ARMSTRONG?

03:23.036 --> 03:24.120
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

03:24.203 --> 03:25.788
- THIS WOMAN
IS A FRIEND OF MINE.

03:25.872 --> 03:27.665
I WANNA MAKE SURE SHE'S GETTING
THE BEST MEDICAL CARE POSSIBLE.

03:27.749 --> 03:32.712
- SHE WILL BE NOW.

03:32.795 --> 03:35.465
- WELL, JIMMY, YOU KNOW ELKA,
AND THESE ARE MY ROOMMATES

03:35.548 --> 03:37.216
JOY AND VICTORIA.
- HELLO.

03:37.300 --> 03:39.636
SO...YOU OKAY?

03:39.719 --> 03:41.095
- YEAH, BUT WHY DID YOU
TELL ME TO DUCK

03:41.179 --> 03:42.805
IF THE BALL WAS
COMING AT ME LOW?

03:42.889 --> 03:45.600
- OH, BECAUSE WHEN A DUCK
IS IN DANGER,

03:45.683 --> 03:48.144
IT FLIES UP AND AWAY.

03:48.227 --> 03:49.312
I WAS KINDA HOPING
YOU'D DO THAT.

03:49.395 --> 03:52.774
- SO...DUCK MEANS JUMP UP?

03:52.857 --> 03:56.486
- OR FLY, YEAH.

03:56.569 --> 03:57.987
HEY, SO YOU WANNA GO GRAB
SOME DINNER TONIGHT?

03:58.071 --> 03:59.322
- ME?
- YEAH.

03:59.405 --> 04:01.407
- I'D LOVE TO.
- AWESOME.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.076
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT, HEY.

04:03.159 --> 04:04.160
CAN SOMEBODY CALL THE VALET,

04:04.243 --> 04:05.495
HAVE THEM BRING
MY PORSCHE AROUND?

04:05.578 --> 04:07.163
- UH, THIS HOSPITAL
DOESN'T HAVE A VALET.

04:07.246 --> 04:12.168
- OH, NO.

04:12.251 --> 04:16.214
THAT POOR GUY THINKS
HE'S A VALET.

04:17.632 --> 04:19.509
- OH, MY GOD.

04:19.591 --> 04:22.178
A PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL PLAYER
JUST ASKED ME OUT AT MY AGE.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.472
IT'S THE MAGIC OF CLEVELAND,
LADIES.

04:24.555 --> 04:26.557
- IN L.A., THE CUT-OFF AGE FOR
DATING A PROFESSIONAL ATHLETE

04:26.641 --> 04:28.685
IS 25.

04:28.768 --> 04:32.814
WELL, 29 IF YOU'RE WILLING
TO DATE A BOWLER.

04:32.897 --> 04:35.858
- WAS THAT JIMMY ARMSTRONG?
- YES.

04:35.942 --> 04:37.151
AND I'M GOING ON A DATE
WITH HIM.

04:37.235 --> 04:39.737
[both scream]

04:39.821 --> 04:41.239
- OH, MY GOD!

04:41.322 --> 04:44.200
YOU ARE GONNA BE THE ENVY
OF EVERY WOMAN IN CLEVELAND.

04:44.283 --> 04:45.493
YOU'RE LUCKY YOU'RE NOT
ON LIFE SUPPORT.

04:45.576 --> 04:48.955
I'D KICK THAT PLUG
RIGHT OUT.

04:50.999 --> 04:54.002
OH, I CAME IN HERE
FOR A REASON.

04:54.085 --> 04:56.170
OH, THERE'S BEEN
A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT.

04:56.254 --> 04:57.922
A CARNY HAD TOO MUCH TO DRINK
AT THE CIRCUS

04:58.006 --> 05:03.052
{\an1}AND FIRED THE HUMAN CANNONBALL
RIGHT INTO A CAR FULL OF CLOWNS.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.053
THERE'VE BEEN MANY SERIOUS
INJURIES

05:04.137 --> 05:06.180
AND WE'RE LOOKING FOR
TYPE AB NEGATIVE BLOOD.

05:06.264 --> 05:08.057
- OH, VICTORIA,
YOU HAVE AB NEGATIVE BLOOD.

05:08.141 --> 05:12.061
- NO, I DON'T BELIEVE I DO
ANYMORE.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.731
- OH, DO SOMETHING SELFLESS
FOR ONCE.

05:14.814 --> 05:16.399
- I DON'T LIKE THE WORD
SELFLESS.

05:16.482 --> 05:19.193
IT IMPLIES THAT AFTERWARDS,
THERE WILL BE LESS SELF.

05:19.277 --> 05:20.778
- BUT IT FEELS GOOD
TO DO SOMETHING NICE

05:20.862 --> 05:23.239
WITHOUT THINKING OF ANY KUDOS.

05:23.322 --> 05:26.868
- KUDOS, YOU SAY.

05:26.951 --> 05:28.786
THIS ROOM FOR HERO
BLOOD DONORS,

05:28.870 --> 05:33.750
IS IT BIG ENOUGH
FOR A CAMERA CREW?

05:33.833 --> 05:36.961
- LADIES, I HAVE YOUR CT SCAN
RESULTS.

05:37.045 --> 05:38.755
YOU COULD USE
A LITTLE MORE CALCIUM,

05:38.838 --> 05:40.923
BUT FOR A WOMAN YOUR AGE,
YOU'RE IN FINE SHAPE.

05:41.007 --> 05:42.925
- WHAT ABOUT ME?

05:43.009 --> 05:45.136
- YOU? YOU'RE THE HEALTHIEST
PERSON I'VE EVER SEEN.

05:45.219 --> 05:47.764
WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING,
YOU KEEP DOING IT, ELKA.

05:47.847 --> 05:50.975
- WHAT? NO, NO, WAIT!

05:51.059 --> 05:53.436
NO, I'M NOT ELKA.
I'M JOY.

05:53.519 --> 05:55.772
- OH, I MUST'VE
MIXED THINGS UP.

05:55.855 --> 05:58.107
YOU'RE ELKA?
- YES.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.234
- YOU'RE A MEDICAL MIRACLE.

06:00.318 --> 06:02.111
YOU COULD LIVE FOREVER.

06:02.195 --> 06:03.488
- FOREVER?

06:03.571 --> 06:05.073
- THAT'S FANTASTIC.

06:05.156 --> 06:08.242
WHAT A WONDERFUL 90TH
BIRTHDAY PRESENT.

06:08.326 --> 06:09.660
HEY, WHAT ABOUT ME?

06:09.744 --> 06:12.121
- WELL, I LOOKED A CHART
AND THOUGHT YOU WERE 90.

06:12.205 --> 06:15.625
DO I NEED TO SPELL IT OUT?

06:15.708 --> 06:18.336
- SO WHAT SHOULD I DO?

06:19.879 --> 06:21.255
GO RED FOR WOMEN.

06:21.339 --> 06:23.424
- IT'S FROM THE AMERICAN
HEART ASSOCIATION.

06:23.508 --> 06:26.260
JUST A FEW SMALL CHANGES
COULD MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE.

06:26.344 --> 06:31.474
- QUIT SMOKING, LIMIT
FATTY FOODS, SALT, AND ALCOHOL.

06:31.557 --> 06:33.309
WELL, AT LEAST I CAN STILL
HAVE SEX.

06:33.392 --> 06:37.480
- WELL, WITH YOUR BRITTLE BONES,
I'D BE CAREFUL.

06:37.563 --> 06:41.442
THE AVERAGE CLEVELAND MAN
COULD SNAP YOU LIKE A TWIG.

06:41.526 --> 06:43.152
- THEY'RE READY FOR YOU
IN THE O.R.

06:43.236 --> 06:48.366
- OH, GOOD.
SEND IN THE CLOWNS.

06:50.076 --> 06:55.706
DON'T BOTHER.
THEY'RE HERE.

06:55.790 --> 06:57.333
- OKAY, YOU MIGHT STILL BE
A LITTLE WOOZY,

06:57.416 --> 06:58.751
SO TRY NOT TO GET UP
TOO QUICKLY.

06:58.835 --> 07:00.169
- WHAT?
YOU'RE DONE?

07:00.253 --> 07:02.213
BUT THE NEWS CREW
ISN'T HERE YET.

07:02.296 --> 07:05.299
DO IT AGAIN.

07:05.383 --> 07:06.717
- NO, YOU NEED TO GET YOUR
BLOOD SUGAR BACK UP.

07:06.801 --> 07:08.010
HAVE A COOKIE.

07:08.094 --> 07:09.220
- IS IT FAT FREE?
- NO.

07:09.303 --> 07:10.721
- NO, THANK YOU.

07:10.805 --> 07:13.307
- GLASS OF ORANGE JUICE?
- IS IT VODKA FREE?

07:13.391 --> 07:17.436
- YES.
- NO, THANK YOU.

07:17.520 --> 07:20.231
[distant chatter]
WHAT IS THAT?

07:20.314 --> 07:22.358
- IT'S A TELEVISION CREW.

07:22.441 --> 07:24.694
- I'M IN HERE!

07:30.616 --> 07:33.536
WHERE AM I?
DID I DIE?

07:33.619 --> 07:36.205
WHAT IS--IS THIS HEAVEN?

07:36.289 --> 07:37.832
[gasps]

07:37.915 --> 07:39.167
A SPOTLIGHT.

07:39.250 --> 07:44.130
ALL ON ME.
OH, THIS IS HEAVEN.

07:48.509 --> 07:52.597
BUT IF I'M IN HEAVEN THEN...
WHERE IS GOD?

07:52.680 --> 07:55.808
[angelic choir]

07:55.892 --> 08:01.439
- WELCOME, MY CHILD.

08:06.652 --> 08:08.738
- ELKA, YOU'RE GOD?
- YES.

08:08.821 --> 08:12.241
WAIT.

08:12.325 --> 08:16.287
THAT'S NOT THE NOSE
I GAVE YOU.

08:16.370 --> 08:17.747
- THE NOSE YOU GAVE ME

08:17.830 --> 08:21.125
WOULD ONLY HAVE LET ME PLAY
CHARACTER PARTS.

08:21.209 --> 08:24.086
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT I GOT
INTO HEAVEN.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.923
I'VE BROKEN, LIKE,
A MILLION COMMANDMENTS.

08:27.006 --> 08:28.966
COVETED EVERYTHING.

08:29.050 --> 08:33.136
I HAVE PLEDGED THOUSANDS
TO PBS AND NEVER PAID.

08:33.221 --> 08:35.722
I JUST WANTED TO HEAR THEM
SAY MY NAME ON TV.

08:35.806 --> 08:39.602
- QUIET,
THERE'S BEEN A MISTAKE.

08:39.684 --> 08:42.772
I MEANT TO SUMMON
VICTORIA PRINCIPAL...

08:42.855 --> 08:45.900
NOT VICTORIA CHASE.

08:45.983 --> 08:49.487
OH, STUPID AUTO CORRECT.

08:49.570 --> 08:51.948
- SO I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE IN HEAVEN?

08:52.031 --> 08:55.785
- NO.
WALK AWAY FROM THE LIGHT.

08:55.868 --> 08:57.745
- WELL, AM I EVER SUPPOSED
TO BE IN HEAVEN?

08:57.828 --> 09:01.290
- WALK AWAY FROM THE LIGHT.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.084
- CAN I JUST ASK YOU
ONE THING?

09:03.167 --> 09:06.963
WHO DO I HAVE TO SLEEP WITH
TO WIN AN OSCAR?

09:07.046 --> 09:09.131
IT CERTAINLY WASN'T
QUENTIN TARANTINO.

09:09.215 --> 09:14.637
I WISH I COULD TAKE THAT BACK.

09:14.720 --> 09:18.099
- CUT THE LIGHT.
WRONG VICTORIA.

09:22.436 --> 09:26.065
- QUENTIN TARANTINO.
ORIGINAL NOSE.

09:29.568 --> 09:32.113
MEL? JOY?

09:32.196 --> 09:33.698
I'M NOT DEAD?

09:33.781 --> 09:35.741
- NO, DARLING,
YOU JUST HAD A BAD FALL.

09:35.825 --> 09:38.452
THE ONLY ONE DYING
AROUND HERE IS ME.

09:38.536 --> 09:41.330
- AND IN MORE GOOD NEWS...

09:41.414 --> 09:43.541
I'M IMMORTAL.

09:43.624 --> 09:45.293
- YOU ARE?

09:45.376 --> 09:48.337
BUT WHERE IS YOUR CLOUD
AND YOUR HEAVENLY IPAD?

09:48.421 --> 09:49.839
- OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:49.922 --> 09:50.840
THE DOCTOR SAID
YOU MIGHT BE DISORIENTED.

09:50.923 --> 09:52.341
SO I'M GONNA GO TELL HIM
YOU'RE AWAKE, OKAY?

09:52.425 --> 09:54.343
- AND I'M GONNA SMOKE
MY LAST CIGARETTE.

09:54.427 --> 09:55.845
- HEY, YOU TOLD US YOU QUIT
YEARS AGO.

09:55.928 --> 09:57.722
- I TELL YOU A LOT OF THINGS.

10:00.766 --> 10:03.686
- WHY ARE YOU STARING AT ME?

10:03.769 --> 10:06.856
- I JUST HAD THE CRAZIEST
DREAM.

10:06.939 --> 10:08.983
I MEAN, I MUST'VE JUST
KNOCKED MYSELF SILLY

10:09.066 --> 10:13.237
BECAUSE I DREAMT
THAT YOU WERE GOD.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.412
- I <i> AM</i> GOD.

10:21.495 --> 10:23.748
- OH, CUT IT OUT.
COME ON.

10:23.831 --> 10:27.043
IF YOU'RE GOD,
THEN WHAT AM I THINK RIGHT NOW?

10:27.126 --> 10:28.502
- YOU'RE WISHING
YOU WERE MORE FAMOUS.

10:28.586 --> 10:32.590
- [gasp]

10:32.673 --> 10:34.342
ANYBODY COULD'VE GUESS THAT.

10:34.425 --> 10:39.889
- COULD ANYBODY HAVE KNOWN
ABOUT YOUR ORIGINAL NOSE?

10:39.972 --> 10:42.391
- YOU MEAN THE CHASE FAMILY
BEAK?

10:42.475 --> 10:44.060
THAT IS MY DEEPEST,
DARKEST SECRET.

10:44.143 --> 10:48.230
- REALLY? NOT SLEEPING
WITH QUENTIN TARANTINO?

10:48.314 --> 10:49.690
- YOU KNOW THAT TOO?

10:49.774 --> 10:53.903
YOU COULDN'T KNOW THAT
UNLESS YOU WERE...

10:53.986 --> 10:56.364
ALL RIGHT, DOES ANYONE ELSE KNOW
THAT YOU'RE...

10:56.447 --> 10:58.282
[whispering] GOD?

10:58.366 --> 11:00.242
- ONLY YOU.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.370
AND YOU CAN'T TELL ANYBODY

11:02.453 --> 11:07.416
OR...LO, YOUR THIGHS
WILL GROW IMMENSE.

11:07.500 --> 11:11.754
AND YOUR EMMY
WILL TURN TO DUST.

11:11.837 --> 11:14.256
- BUT WHY ARE YOU REVEALING
YOURSELF TO ME NOW?

11:14.340 --> 11:17.426
- BECAUSE YOU'RE SO BRILLIANT
AND TALENTED.

11:17.510 --> 11:20.221
- THAT MAKES SENSE.

11:20.304 --> 11:24.100
- AND BECAUSE I WANT YOU
TO CHANGE YOUR WAYS.

11:24.183 --> 11:27.311
YOU NEED TO BE KIND
AND GENEROUS.

11:27.395 --> 11:31.107
AND DO CHARITABLE WORKS.
- THAT'S NOT SO BAD.

11:31.190 --> 11:34.568
- WITHOUT ALERTING THE MEDIA.

11:34.652 --> 11:37.988
- YOU'RE A VENGEFUL GOD.

11:42.410 --> 11:43.994
- [gasp] JOY!

11:44.078 --> 11:45.454
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.
LOOK AT THAT HEART-HEALTHY MEAL.

11:45.538 --> 11:48.290
- HEART DISEASE IS
THE NUMBER ONE KILLER OF WOMEN.

11:48.374 --> 11:50.292
HEART DISEASE IS THE NUMBER ONE
KILLER OF ME.

11:50.376 --> 11:54.130
MANY WOMEN DON'T PERSONALIZE
THE RISK.

11:54.213 --> 11:59.552
- LOOK AT YOU
WITH NEW FUN THINGS TO SAY.

11:59.635 --> 12:01.887
- DON'T PATRONIZE ME!
I'M IN A HIDEOUS MOOD.

12:01.971 --> 12:06.809
THIS MORNING, I DRANK TEA
MADE FROM A NICOTINE PATCH.

12:06.892 --> 12:08.477
- WHERE'S VICTORIA?

12:08.561 --> 12:10.479
- SHE SAID SHE AND ELKA
WERE GOING TO A SOUP KITCHEN.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.356
- WHAT?
THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

12:12.440 --> 12:15.943
- STOP YELLING AT ME!
I'M DOING THE BEST I CAN!

12:16.026 --> 12:18.279
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
THEY'RE AT A SOUP KITCHEN.

12:18.362 --> 12:19.488
BOY, VICTORIA MUST'VE
HIT HER HEAD

12:19.572 --> 12:20.865
A LOT HARDER
THAN WE THOUGHT, HUH?

12:20.948 --> 12:22.658
[phone chiming]
OOH! GOOGLE ALERT.

12:22.741 --> 12:24.368
[gasp] OH, WAIT TILL
YOU SEE THIS.

12:24.452 --> 12:26.662
- PLEASE LET IT BE A STUDY
THAT SAYS ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO

12:26.745 --> 12:28.497
ARE THE NEW BROCCOLI.

12:28.581 --> 12:32.001
- NO, IT'S A PICTURE OF ME
AND JIMMY ON CLEVELAND.COM.

12:32.084 --> 12:34.795
"JIMMY ARMSTRONG IN THE VIP
SECTION OF THE VELVET TANGO ROOM

12:34.879 --> 12:37.006
WITH UNIDENTIFIED BRUNETTE
ARM CANDY."

12:37.089 --> 12:39.383
I'VE NEVER BEEN CALLED
ARM CANDY!

12:39.467 --> 12:43.512
IN L.A., AT BEST,
I WAS A SENSIBLE ARM SNACK.

12:43.596 --> 12:46.182
- AND IT REALLY DOESN'T BOTHER
YOU THAT HE'S NOT THAT BRIGHT.

12:46.265 --> 12:49.226
- BUP, BUP, BUP.
HE'S VERY INTERESTING.

12:49.310 --> 12:51.562
- HE'S NOT INTERESTING.
HE'S FAMOUS.

12:51.645 --> 12:53.481
YOU'RE LOOKING AT HIM
THROUGH FAME GOGGLES,

12:53.564 --> 12:58.861
WHEN IN REALITY, HE IS ABOUT
AS DUMB AND STUPID AS THIS MILK.

12:58.944 --> 13:01.989
OH, WHY CAN'T 2% BE
THE ALCOHOL CONTENT?

13:02.072 --> 13:03.574
[knocking]
- KNOCK, KNOCK!

13:03.657 --> 13:09.872
- IT'S HIS THING.

13:09.955 --> 13:11.081
- HEY, WHY DIDN'T
YOU COME OUT?

13:11.165 --> 13:16.795
I YELLED "HONK, HONK"
FROM THE CAR.

13:20.799 --> 13:23.260
- WOW, THAT WAS SO MUCH FUN.

13:23.344 --> 13:25.095
I MEAN, PEOPLE JUST GO CRAZY
AROUND YOU.

13:25.179 --> 13:26.055
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU PAID FOR A MEAL?

13:26.138 --> 13:28.390
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU PAID FOR ANYTHING?

13:28.474 --> 13:30.226
- WELL, I HAVEN'T CARRIED
A WALLET SINCE '98.

13:30.309 --> 13:31.602
- OH, IS THAT THE YEAR
YOU GOT DRAFTED?

13:31.685 --> 13:34.605
- NO, IT'S THE YEAR
I LOST MY WALLET.

13:34.688 --> 13:37.066
YOU KNOW WHAT?
UH, MELANIE, I BEEN THINKING.

13:37.149 --> 13:41.904
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

13:41.987 --> 13:43.405
TO MAKE THE PLAYOFFS
THIS YEAR,

13:43.489 --> 13:45.908
WE HAVE TO WIN
OUR FINAL FOUR GAMES.

13:45.991 --> 13:51.914
PROBLEM IS WE ONLY HAVE
ONE GAME LEFT TO PLAY.

13:51.997 --> 13:53.832
- YES, I CAN SEE HOW
THAT WOULD BE A PROBLEM.

13:53.916 --> 13:56.418
BUT UM, THERE'S ALWAYS
NEXT YEAR.

13:56.502 --> 13:58.462
- ACTUALLY, I DON'T EVEN
WANNA PLAY THE NEXT GAME.

13:58.546 --> 14:00.381
THIS IS IT FOR ME.
I'M DONE.

14:00.464 --> 14:04.760
159 GAMES IS A NICE
ROUND NUMBER.

14:04.843 --> 14:06.428
- NO, NO.
NO, NO, NO.

14:06.512 --> 14:08.264
NO, YOU HAVE TO AT LEAST
FINISH OUT THE SEASON.

14:08.347 --> 14:09.974
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE RIGHT.

14:10.057 --> 14:11.976
I COULD AT LEAST FINISH OUT
THE LAST GAME.

14:12.059 --> 14:16.438
WHAT'S THE WORST THING
THAT COULD HAPPEN?

14:16.522 --> 14:18.649
- JIMMY, I FEEL AWFUL
FOR TALKING YOU INTO PLAYING.

14:18.732 --> 14:19.858
- DON'T.

14:19.942 --> 14:21.694
THE GOOD NEWS IS NOW WE GET
TO SPEND MORE TIME TOGETHER

14:21.777 --> 14:22.945
AS REGULAR PEOPLE.

14:23.028 --> 14:26.323
- OH, YEAH,
THAT IS GOOD NEWS.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.452
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE,
VICTORIA?

14:30.536 --> 14:35.082
- OH, YOU KNOW, GOD'S WORK.

14:35.165 --> 14:37.459
- SO YOU WANNA GO BACK
TO THE SPONGEBOB MARATHON?

14:37.543 --> 14:38.919
- SURE! WHY NOT?

14:39.003 --> 14:41.964
- OOH, OR WE COULD TALK ABOUT,
AFTER WE DIE,

14:42.047 --> 14:46.135
WHETHER WE'D RATHER COME BACK
AS A SHRIMP OR A CLAM.

14:46.218 --> 14:49.430
I THINK MY ANSWER
MAY SURPRISE YOU.

14:49.513 --> 14:51.140
- HOW COME NOBODY TOLD ME
JIMMY IS DUMB?

14:51.223 --> 14:54.518
- AND THE FAME GOGGLES
ARE OFF.

14:54.602 --> 14:59.148
- FAME IS A FALSE IDOL.

14:59.231 --> 15:01.650
- WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?
YOU'RE VOLUNTEERING.

15:01.734 --> 15:04.361
YOU'RE HELPING THE NEEDY.
AND--[gasps].

15:04.445 --> 15:07.656
IS THAT YOUR NATURAL
HAIR COLOR?

15:10.200 --> 15:16.123
- IT'S THE COLOR GOD GAVE ME.

15:16.206 --> 15:17.958
- OH, YOU'VE GOTTA BE
KIDDING ME.

15:18.042 --> 15:19.710
IN YOUR LIVING WILL,
IT SAYS "DO NOT RESUSCITATE"

15:19.793 --> 15:23.047
IF YOUR ROOTS START TO SHOW.

15:23.130 --> 15:24.840
- SO SHE REALLY IS DOWDY?

15:24.923 --> 15:26.300
I JUST THOUGHT EVER SINCE
I STOPPED DRINKING,

15:26.383 --> 15:28.135
EVERYONE LOOKS TERRIBLE.

15:28.218 --> 15:33.682
- I DON'T LOOK BAD.
- O-KAY.

15:33.766 --> 15:36.226
- OKAY, WHAT AM I GONNA DO
ABOUT JIMMY?

15:36.310 --> 15:38.854
I HAVE TO BREAK UP WITH HIM
BUT IT'S MY FAULT HE GOT HURT.

15:38.937 --> 15:41.023
- WHAT YOU NEED IS SOME
LITTLE TRAMP TO SEDUCE HIM

15:41.106 --> 15:42.858
SO YOU CAN DUMP HIM
GUILT FREE.

15:42.941 --> 15:44.234
- JOY, THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

15:44.318 --> 15:47.029
I CAN WALK IN,
CATCH YOU IN BED WITH HIM,

15:47.112 --> 15:50.824
BREAK UP, AND EVERYBODY'S HANDS
ARE CLEAN.

15:50.908 --> 15:52.868
- DID YOU JUST CALL ME
A TRAMP?

15:52.951 --> 15:55.663
- NO, I THINK YOU SAID IT.

15:55.746 --> 15:58.040
PLEASE?
- OH, FINE.

15:58.123 --> 15:59.875
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
NO, NO, NO, NO.

15:59.958 --> 16:03.212
MEL, ISN'T WHAT YOU'RE ASKING
JOY TO DO A SIN?

16:03.295 --> 16:05.881
WELL, ISN'T IT?

16:05.964 --> 16:07.174
- I DON'T THINK SO.

16:07.257 --> 16:11.762
- WELL, THEN NEITHER DO I.

16:20.646 --> 16:22.856
- HELLO, JIMMY.

16:22.940 --> 16:28.862
YOU'RE LOOK VERY--

16:28.946 --> 16:31.073
- ARE YOU OKAY?
- YEAH.

16:31.156 --> 16:32.533
I JUST GAVE UP SMOKING,

16:32.616 --> 16:35.911
AND I'M STILL BRINGING UP
A LOT OF PHLEGM.

16:35.994 --> 16:39.415
I MEAN...

16:39.498 --> 16:41.041
I WANT TO GET TO KNOW YOU
BETTER, JIMMY.

16:41.125 --> 16:43.252
- OH, OKAY, THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

16:43.335 --> 16:44.920
UH, WHY DON'T YOU
COME OVER HERE,

16:45.003 --> 16:46.046
HELP ME FIND WHAT'S OUT OF PLACE
IN THIS PICTURE?

16:46.130 --> 16:47.756
I'VE ALREADY FOUND ONE.

16:47.840 --> 16:51.593
I MEAN, WHAT IS A SNOWMAN
DOING IN A PUMPKIN PATCH?

16:51.677 --> 16:53.929
- OH, JIMMY.

16:54.012 --> 16:56.724
JIMMY, JIMMY, JIMMY.

16:56.807 --> 16:58.767
THE ONLY THING WRONG
WITH THIS PICTURE

16:58.851 --> 17:02.771
IS THAT I'M NOT WITH YOU.

17:02.855 --> 17:06.316
- WELL, WHY WOULD WE BE
IN A PUMPKIN PATCH?

17:06.400 --> 17:08.569
- I'M TALKING ABOUT
THE BIGGER PICTURE.

17:08.652 --> 17:13.406
ALL I SEE IS YOU AND ME
AND A BED.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.492
- AND THERE'S
SOME MEDICAL EQUIPMENT.

17:16.577 --> 17:18.078
AND A TV.

17:18.162 --> 17:19.621
- I'M NOT LISTING THINGS
IN THE ROOM, YOU IDIOT!

17:19.704 --> 17:23.959
I'M TRYING TO SEDUCE YOU!

17:24.041 --> 17:26.336
- JOY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN BED WITH MY BOYFRIEND?

17:26.420 --> 17:29.006
JOY, WHY AREN'T YOU IN BED
WITH MY BOYFRIEND?

17:32.092 --> 17:35.012
AND I--I JUST DON'T THINK
IT'S GONNA WORK OUT WITH US.

17:35.095 --> 17:36.513
BUT I SHOULD'VE JUST
TOLD YOU THAT

17:36.597 --> 17:38.265
INSTEAD OF DOING THAT
SILLY STUNT WITH JOY.

17:38.348 --> 17:40.559
- MELANIE, I JUST WANT YOU
TO BE HAPPY.

17:40.642 --> 17:43.145
AND IF THAT MEANS WE SHOULD
BREAK UP, THEN SO BE IT.

17:43.228 --> 17:46.315
- AW, DON'T LOOK SO SAD.
YOU'LL FIND SOMEBODY NEW.

17:46.398 --> 17:47.816
ONCE YOU GET
OUT OF THIS HOSPITAL

17:47.900 --> 17:50.152
AND YOUR LEG GETS
REHABILITATED--

17:50.235 --> 17:52.279
- OH, HEY, YOU WANNA BE
MY NEW GIRLFRIEND?

17:52.362 --> 17:53.697
- OF COURSE!
WHO WOULDN'T?

17:53.781 --> 17:56.283
- SHE WOULDN'T.

17:56.366 --> 17:59.703
- WHAT ARE YOU, STUPID?

18:17.805 --> 18:21.350
- VERY FUNNY, JOY.

18:21.433 --> 18:24.686
THANK YOU ALL
FOR A WONDERFUL BIRTHDAY WEEK.

18:24.770 --> 18:29.066
OH, MELANIE, THANK YOU
FOR THE BROWN'S LOCKER ROOM.

18:29.149 --> 18:32.194
AND JOY, THANK YOU
FOR THE CHAMPAGNE.

18:32.277 --> 18:35.697
- IT'S MY FAVORITE.
ENJOY IT IN GOOD HEALTH.

18:35.781 --> 18:37.366
[whimpers]

18:37.449 --> 18:40.369
- THAT'S IT!
WE'RE HAVING AN INTERVENTION.

18:40.452 --> 18:44.581
JOY, YOU HAVE
TO START DRINKING AGAIN.

18:46.542 --> 18:50.420
LIKE LIFE, YOU'RE VERY HARD
TO TAKE WITHOUT ALCOHOL.

18:52.923 --> 18:57.678
- HELLO, OLD FRIEND.

18:57.761 --> 19:00.138
- GIVE UP SOMETHING ELSE.

19:00.222 --> 19:02.391
I MEAN, JUST CUT BACK
ON EVERYTHING ELSE.

19:02.474 --> 19:05.310
- OH, SHE'S RIGHT.
FROM GOD'S LIPS TO YOUR EARS.

19:09.815 --> 19:11.525
- ELKA, TOLD US THIS MORNING
THAT SHE HAD YOU CONVINCED

19:11.608 --> 19:13.277
SHE WAS GOD.

19:13.360 --> 19:15.028
- OH, NO.

19:15.112 --> 19:18.156
YOU KNOW THE JOKE'S ON
ALL OF YOU

19:18.240 --> 19:21.577
BECAUSE I KNEW ALL ALONG.

19:21.660 --> 19:24.079
WAIT, WAIT.
HOW DID YOU KNOW ALL MY SECRETS?

19:24.163 --> 19:26.206
- YOU WERE MUMBLING
IN YOUR SLEEP AT THE HOSPITAL.

19:26.290 --> 19:29.918
- SO YOU PUT ME THROUGH
ALL OF THAT JUST FOR A JOKE?

19:30.002 --> 19:32.754
- YES!

19:32.838 --> 19:35.424
NO.

19:35.507 --> 19:39.720
YOU COULDN'T EVEN GIVE BLOOD
WITHOUT A CAMERA CREW.

19:39.803 --> 19:42.055
I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS TIME
SOMEBODY GAVE YOU A PUSH

19:42.139 --> 19:45.100
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

19:45.183 --> 19:48.896
- WELL, YOU MAY NOT BE
TOTALLY WRONG.

19:48.979 --> 19:51.773
I MEAN, HELPING OTHERS
REALLY WASN'T SO BAD.

19:51.857 --> 19:54.401
IT MADE ME...FEEL GOOD
ABOUT MYSELF

19:54.484 --> 19:56.445
IN A NEW AND DIFFERENT WAY.

19:56.528 --> 19:58.280
YOU KNOW, I MIGHT STILL
KEEP ON DOING IT.

19:58.363 --> 20:01.909
BUT LIKE JOY--
ONLY IN MODERATION.

20:01.992 --> 20:03.577
I AM GOING TO LIGHT
THE CANDLES.

20:03.660 --> 20:05.454
- YES.
TO ELKA.

20:05.537 --> 20:09.791
YOU MAY NOT BE GOD,
BUT YOU ARE CERTAINLY DIVINE.

20:11.376 --> 20:15.505
IF I WERE GOD, MY BIRTHDAY
WISH WOULD COME TRUE.

20:21.720 --> 20:24.222
WHAT ARE YOU STILL DOING HERE?
