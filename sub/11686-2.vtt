00:08.400 --> 00:10.084
Well, Richard, according
to all of your test results,

00:10.320 --> 00:13.483
you are what we
in the medical field call healthy.

00:13.600 --> 00:15.602
In fact, you've got kind of a glow about you.

00:15.680 --> 00:17.011
- Oh, really?
- Absolutely.

00:17.120 --> 00:20.488
You know, if it were medically possible,
I might even think that you were pregnant.

00:20.560 --> 00:22.210
Of course, I thought
my girlfriend was pregnant,

00:22.280 --> 00:24.248
and I was sure wrong about that. Whoops!

00:24.960 --> 00:27.122
Hey, give me that ring back!

00:27.440 --> 00:29.044
Oh, what a mess.

00:29.600 --> 00:31.125
What a mess that was.

00:32.960 --> 00:36.203
So, been any big changes for you,
diet or exercise?

00:36.280 --> 00:39.568
Well, I actually got fired
as CEO of my company.

00:39.640 --> 00:43.247
I'm working now as the CTO
under the new CEO, Jack Barker.

00:43.320 --> 00:46.290
Wait a minute.
You got a boss at your own company?

00:46.400 --> 00:51.406
Yeah, I know that sounds bad,
but honestly, he handles all the budgeting,

00:51.480 --> 00:52.891
all the VC funding.

00:52.960 --> 00:56.442
He just negotiated a great new lease
on our new offices.

00:56.520 --> 00:58.249
I don't know.
I think this could be great for me.

00:58.320 --> 01:01.881
Boy, I don't think I could have another doctor
coming in here, being my boss.

01:01.960 --> 01:05.203
No. It'd be like, "Hey, boss,
is it okay if I listen to his heart?

01:05.280 --> 01:08.329
"Can I do that? Oh, no? Sorry.
No, I won't. Okay.

01:08.640 --> 01:09.641
"Whatever you say."

01:10.920 --> 01:13.400
- Funny.
- It is funny. Yeah.

01:13.480 --> 01:15.801
But listen, if it works for you, that's great.

01:15.880 --> 01:19.089
Just one more thing.
I've gotta check your testicles.

01:19.160 --> 01:22.881
Oh, my God. Okay.
What, for like a hernia or something?

01:22.960 --> 01:25.406
No. I just wanna make sure they're still there.

01:48.840 --> 01:53.129
Oh, wow.
This is going to be our office? All of this?

01:53.200 --> 01:54.770
Yeah,
Jack said we have the whole floor.

01:57.040 --> 01:58.280
Wow, look at that kitchen.
This is great.

01:59.720 --> 02:00.846
Richard, is that our new logo?

02:02.720 --> 02:07.282
I like it. It's clean and elegant,
but not without some danger.

02:07.880 --> 02:09.291
Gentlemen, welcome.

02:09.360 --> 02:12.648
I moved away from the flute-playing guy.

02:12.720 --> 02:16.042
I don't know if you guys realized it,
but that was a little phallic.

02:16.240 --> 02:18.971
I didn't want to waste your time with it,
so I just pulled the trigger.

02:19.040 --> 02:20.326
Mari Sheibley did this.

02:20.600 --> 02:23.490
Oh. Mari Sheibley.
That must've set you back a bit.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.483
No. She's a friend.

02:25.560 --> 02:28.450
Yeah. I know her, as well.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.411
Casually.

02:31.480 --> 02:33.926
So, why don't I show
you guys your new home?

02:34.000 --> 02:36.082
Hopefully, it lives up to your standards.

02:36.800 --> 02:39.007
Yeah, compared to
the shit shack we're used to,

02:39.080 --> 02:40.320
anything's an improvement.

02:40.400 --> 02:42.687
Ah, an insult born of respect.

02:42.760 --> 02:45.764
I'll worry when we start
complimenting each other.

02:45.840 --> 02:46.966
Fucking dick.

02:47.040 --> 02:50.010
I assume you saw Hiroki
putting in the water feature.

02:50.080 --> 02:52.208
Good feng shui. Gotta have that.

02:53.800 --> 02:56.087
This is the engineering area.

02:56.280 --> 02:57.281
We're gonna work here?

02:57.360 --> 03:01.763
That is a separate, professionally-catered
micro-kitchen back there.

03:01.840 --> 03:04.366
I want you hungry here, never here.

03:04.440 --> 03:07.125
This is all great,
but can we really afford all this?

03:08.120 --> 03:10.407
Hey, step into my office, Richard.

03:10.480 --> 03:11.925
- Here.
- Okay.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.445
I wanna show you something.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.048
This is way better
than Erlich's shithole.

03:17.680 --> 03:20.160
"The Conjoined
Triangles of Success"?

03:20.600 --> 03:24.446
I invented that,
and now it's taught at business schools.

03:24.520 --> 03:28.445
You see what's on the bottom here?
The foundation of the whole thing.

03:28.800 --> 03:30.006
- Growth?
- Growth.

03:31.280 --> 03:35.205
The more brilliant people
we can get working here,

03:35.280 --> 03:39.205
then the faster we can get
whatever is in your head out into the world.

03:39.960 --> 03:42.042
Let me tell you a story.

03:42.120 --> 03:44.248
In 1999,

03:44.320 --> 03:48.405
Google was a little startup, just like we are.

03:48.480 --> 03:51.723
And when they started
bringing in chefs and masseuses,

03:51.800 --> 03:53.370
we thought, "They're nuts!"

03:53.440 --> 03:56.171
But they were attracting
the best possible people,

03:56.240 --> 04:01.849
and they were able to create the best product,
and now they're worth over $400 billion.

04:02.800 --> 04:04.529
And do you know the name of that company?

04:06.760 --> 04:09.809
Uh, Google, right?
You said it at the beginning of the story.

04:09.880 --> 04:12.121
You're right. I did that wrong.

04:13.000 --> 04:17.130
And the whole point is
that all of this is a sound investment

04:17.200 --> 04:21.728
as long as we are able to get the best people
and make the best possible product.

04:23.880 --> 04:26.690
All right. Winner gets the big monitor. Okay?

04:26.840 --> 04:28.524
I understand how this works.

04:28.600 --> 04:29.931
Ready?
Ready?

04:30.040 --> 04:32.520
- Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.
- Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

04:34.240 --> 04:35.446
Suck it.

04:35.520 --> 04:37.170
I should've known you'd throw rock.

04:37.360 --> 04:40.045
That's all you know in Pakistan.
It's in your blood.

04:40.240 --> 04:41.651
Don't you guys call it "Rock, Rock, Rock"?

04:41.760 --> 04:42.807
That's funny.

04:42.880 --> 04:45.281
You should type up all your racist jokes
on your tiny monitor.

04:45.360 --> 04:48.204
Is that monitor not big enough?
You need a bigger monitor?

04:48.280 --> 04:52.126
You just put it on the list over there,
and our purchasing guy will hook you up.

04:52.680 --> 04:54.728
- Seriously?
- Absolutely.

04:54.880 --> 04:58.487
Jared, how about you?
You need any new gear for the office?

04:58.720 --> 05:00.802
No, I'm BYOC.

05:01.040 --> 05:02.804
Let me know if you need anything.

05:04.360 --> 05:07.603
Richard, do you think it'd be okay
if, uh, I took this box?

05:07.680 --> 05:09.921
I'm moving out
of Noah's guest house after work.

05:10.400 --> 05:11.845
And you want to sleep in that box?

05:14.120 --> 05:17.363
No. I haven't slept in a box in years. Stop.

05:17.440 --> 05:19.761
Now that, um, Pied Piper's funded,

05:19.880 --> 05:22.326
I have enough money
to move back into my condo.

05:22.400 --> 05:23.765
Oh, congratulations.

05:23.960 --> 05:25.007
I thought you sold it.

05:25.080 --> 05:28.323
No, I've been AirBNB'ing it out
to cover the mortgage.

05:28.400 --> 05:30.084
But it'll be good to get home.

05:30.280 --> 05:31.691
I've been missing my tub a lot,

05:31.760 --> 05:34.889
and, uh, Noah's been using
a lot of hate speech with me lately,

05:34.960 --> 05:36.883
so, moving will be a good thing.

05:36.960 --> 05:38.849
All right, guys, think I'm gonna take off

05:38.920 --> 05:41.366
unless you need me to stick around,
help the transition.

05:42.320 --> 05:43.526
-L...
- By doing what?

05:44.600 --> 05:47.410
I could introduce you
to some of the people that work here.

05:47.480 --> 05:50.404
I made some major inroads with Hiroki.

05:50.480 --> 05:53.768
- No.
- Uh, why would we want that?

05:54.880 --> 05:56.484
Fair... Yeah, fair point.

05:56.560 --> 05:58.449
So, welcome to your new home.

05:58.680 --> 06:01.604
Enjoy it, guys. I gave you this.

06:04.960 --> 06:06.803
on.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.400
Sorry. Sorry.

06:12.640 --> 06:13.687
How was everyone's morning?

06:16.120 --> 06:17.690
Let me tell you about mine.

06:17.760 --> 06:22.129
I started my day, as I always do,
by typing my own name into Hooli-Search.

06:22.240 --> 06:26.040
I enjoy the ritual,
which is designed to center me.

06:26.120 --> 06:27.963
But lately, it's been doing the opposite.

06:28.480 --> 06:29.970
Whose work station is this?

06:32.840 --> 06:33.966
Observe.

06:38.280 --> 06:41.762
These are all remnants of a time
before I wrote Nucleus down.

06:42.280 --> 06:47.002
Why are we allowing our own technology
to dredge up our painful past?

06:47.080 --> 06:51.244
Why is it that when I type my own name
into my own company search engine,

06:51.320 --> 06:54.529
the fucking Internet rains
shit-bolts down on me?

06:54.640 --> 06:56.927
I want this to stop!

06:58.320 --> 07:00.561
These articles are part of the public record.

07:01.840 --> 07:02.887
Your point?

07:04.160 --> 07:05.685
Are you suggesting that we alter

07:05.760 --> 07:08.366
the fundamental neutrality
of the Hooli-Search algorithm?

07:08.840 --> 07:11.491
That's a clear violation of the public trust.

07:11.560 --> 07:13.722
Yelp is threatening to sue
Google for this very thing.

07:13.800 --> 07:17.521
I can't, in good conscience,
order Hooli-Search engineers to do that.

07:17.600 --> 07:20.285
I never suggested anything of the sort.

07:20.360 --> 07:22.328
No Hooli-Search engineer

07:22.400 --> 07:26.325
will ever be asked to alter the neutrality
of the algorithm.

07:29.320 --> 07:30.560
And so, Gavin doesn't want to see

07:30.640 --> 07:33.041
any more negative mentions
of Nucleus on Hooli-Search.

07:34.800 --> 07:37.644
So, we're gonna alter the search algorithm?

07:37.720 --> 07:39.449
Of course not. That would be unethical.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.210
What are we supposed to do?

07:41.280 --> 07:44.682
Promote other websites to outrank
the bad Nucleus news?

07:44.760 --> 07:46.569
Do you have any idea
how big a fucking job that is?

07:46.640 --> 07:48.642
Don't you swear at me.

07:48.720 --> 07:49.960
We don't work here anymore.

07:50.040 --> 07:51.610
For 10 more days you do!

07:51.680 --> 07:55.048
Unless you'd all like to quit and walk away
from your entire severance packages!

07:58.120 --> 07:59.281
Amazing.

08:09.120 --> 08:10.610
Whoa, whoa! Oh.

08:14.080 --> 08:16.401
Jared. Whoa. What's up?

08:17.000 --> 08:18.411
Hi. Um...

08:18.720 --> 08:23.647
I'm sorry, I'm a little confused.
You were supposed to be out on Tuesday.

08:24.240 --> 08:26.686
Oh, I was, but plans have changed.

08:26.760 --> 08:32.563
See, I can't really afford to move or pay rent,
so I'm gonna have to stay a little while.

08:32.640 --> 08:34.210
Okay, look, um...

08:34.280 --> 08:39.410
I appreciate your situation,
but you're breaking the terms of our contract.

08:40.120 --> 08:43.522
Listen, I don't want to be a dick,
it's just, I can't afford to live around here

08:43.600 --> 08:46.490
'cause the rent is so high,
because of the tech companies, right?

08:46.560 --> 08:48.927
And you bought this place
with the money you made

08:49.000 --> 08:53.961
working at the tech companies,
so, it kind of all evens out, right?

08:54.840 --> 08:57.047
That... That makes no sense.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.884
I know. Right?

08:58.960 --> 09:02.760
Okay, look, I can give you a few days,
uh, two weeks tops,

09:02.840 --> 09:07.289
but if you're not out by then,
I'm gonna have to take legal action.

09:08.560 --> 09:09.800
This bums me out, man.

09:10.640 --> 09:13.291
I thought you were, like,
the one cool tech guy.

09:14.240 --> 09:15.321
Me?

09:16.040 --> 09:17.166
Are you sure?

09:17.240 --> 09:18.480
Not anymore.

09:19.480 --> 09:20.641
Well...

09:22.760 --> 09:27.243
Well, the occupant of a residence in California
has almost unlimited rights.

09:27.320 --> 09:29.926
I have to get his permission
to enter my property.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.402
I can't turn off the power or the gas,
and I have to hire a lawyer

09:33.480 --> 09:34.641
to start a legal eviction.

09:34.760 --> 09:36.091
That won't be cheap.

09:36.160 --> 09:38.686
Jeez, man. I'm sorry. That sucks.

09:38.760 --> 09:40.410
So, where did you sleep last night?

09:40.480 --> 09:43.006
I did not. How was your sleep?

09:43.320 --> 09:45.004
Uh... It was good, yeah.

09:45.080 --> 09:46.411
I mean, I slept like a stone.

09:46.520 --> 09:49.285
It's odd not having to do
everything ourselves, isn't it?

09:49.640 --> 09:51.608
Yeah, I'm, uh, I'm kind of loving it.

09:52.640 --> 09:54.449
Hey, you ready to go to work?

09:54.520 --> 09:56.602
Chef Amy asked us
what we wanted for breakfast,

09:56.680 --> 09:58.250
and I said, "Surprise us."

09:58.320 --> 09:59.685
Could be anything. Let's go!

10:00.840 --> 10:02.922
When was the last time you saw those two

10:03.000 --> 10:06.049
-go anywhere before noon?
-Indeed.

10:06.120 --> 10:08.646
Well, let's go get some gluten-free waffles.

10:10.520 --> 10:12.090
Sorry about the surprise.

10:12.160 --> 10:14.049
- I don't care.
- I asked Chef Amy to tell me.

10:14.120 --> 10:18.091
I have too many dietary restrictions
to leave breakfast to chance.

10:18.160 --> 10:19.366
Makes sense.

10:19.440 --> 10:22.444
Ah, two of my incubees off to eat the world.

10:22.520 --> 10:24.761
Be well, work hard, and know one another.

10:27.120 --> 10:28.167
Okay.

10:28.240 --> 10:31.210
I recently helped them install
a new CEO at Pied Piper.

10:31.280 --> 10:35.001
I needed to take a more hands-off approach,
focus on the future...

10:35.080 --> 10:40.883
-Incubees, like yourself, with great ideas,
like cataloging malware.

10:40.960 --> 10:42.166
Sexy.

10:42.240 --> 10:44.447
Uh, would you care
for another coconut water?

10:44.520 --> 10:49.208
They are the most expensive
unpasteurized variety, if that's any concern.

10:50.160 --> 10:53.209
Actually, my concern is the room.

10:54.080 --> 10:55.525
It's kind of a dump.

10:55.600 --> 10:57.011
Oh, sure, now.

10:57.080 --> 10:59.082
But, uh, with a new coat of paint,

10:59.160 --> 11:02.323
you'll hardly recognize the place
when you move in next month.

11:02.400 --> 11:05.609
Actually, uh, shit's pivoted.

11:05.680 --> 11:07.170
I need a place next week.

11:07.240 --> 11:09.129
Next week? Shit has pivoted.

11:09.200 --> 11:11.885
Well, I'll talk to the current tenant.

11:11.960 --> 11:15.362
Let him know that the time has come...

11:15.920 --> 11:18.082
Mother fuck...

11:19.080 --> 11:22.607
Uh... Yeah, put him on a slow boat
to China, so to speak.

11:22.680 --> 11:24.887
I'm sorry. lt just slipped out.

11:24.960 --> 11:26.849
I'll ask Chef Amy to make you something else.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.410
No, no, no, I want waffles.

11:28.600 --> 11:32.047
I just wanted them to be a surprise, Jared.
I wanted surprise waffles.

11:33.280 --> 11:34.964
Who are these people?

11:35.280 --> 11:38.250
Uh... I don't know.
Did Jack hire engineers already?

11:38.440 --> 11:41.046
These people are not
in the engineering gene pool.

11:41.120 --> 11:44.727
That's right, fellas.
These are our new sales people.

11:44.800 --> 11:46.325
They're the best in the business.

11:48.960 --> 11:51.645
Sales? Uh, Jack?

11:51.720 --> 11:53.210
Jack?

11:53.280 --> 11:56.489
Shouldn't we hire engineers
to build the platform

11:56.560 --> 11:58.130
before we get people to sell it?

11:58.960 --> 12:01.531
No. God, no!

12:04.640 --> 12:05.641
The system, Richard.

12:05.720 --> 12:09.930
Sales and engineering are the two pillars
of the Conjoined Triangles of Success.

12:10.040 --> 12:13.169
- Yeah.
- Engineering and sales must work together

12:13.240 --> 12:15.811
to decide what to build.

12:16.640 --> 12:18.563
Who knows better what the customers need

12:18.640 --> 12:21.564
than the people who actually deal
with the customers every single day?

12:21.640 --> 12:23.165
We're all gonna meet at 1:00, Richard.

12:23.240 --> 12:25.129
You're gonna love these guys.
They're the best.

12:27.280 --> 12:31.604
So, while the Hooli lawsuit
did hamper our ability to get funding,

12:31.680 --> 12:33.284
it did not slow down the engineering.

12:34.240 --> 12:35.241
Yes, question?

12:35.320 --> 12:36.765
Yeah, Keith, Northeast Regional.

12:36.840 --> 12:40.287
So, you don't foresee
any technical debt issues

12:40.360 --> 12:41.691
slowing our ability to scale?

12:42.080 --> 12:44.208
Actually, no, uh, none whatsoever.

12:44.280 --> 12:48.330
We've identified all our underlying issues,
and we have a plan in place for rapid growth.

12:49.200 --> 12:50.201
Uh, yes?

12:50.680 --> 12:53.206
Uh, Don, Global Accounts
and Systems Integration.

12:53.280 --> 12:55.282
What kind of growth are you projecting here?

12:55.720 --> 13:00.851
Uh... Well, this may sound a little bit
grandiose, but it's not unrealistic

13:00.920 --> 13:04.766
to think that we have the potential
for worldwide penetration

13:04.840 --> 13:07.889
on the scale of, say, Google or Facebook.

13:08.360 --> 13:10.931
This is really great, Richard. Just keep going.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.126
Sure. Yeah. Uh...

13:12.840 --> 13:16.811
Well, in regards to the launch,

13:16.880 --> 13:19.087
we are hoping to go wide, um,

13:19.160 --> 13:21.208
get it into the hands
of as many people as possible.

13:22.360 --> 13:24.727
Jan, Director, Inside Sales.
They call me "Jan the Man."

13:24.800 --> 13:25.801
Oh.

13:25.880 --> 13:28.201
When you say "people,"
you mean "companies," right?

13:28.280 --> 13:30.806
- Yeah, we're business-facing.
- Okay, just wanted to clarify.

13:30.880 --> 13:33.360
Actually, no. No, sorry, uh, Jan the Man.

13:33.560 --> 13:37.246
By "people,"
I do mean "people." Humans. Consumers.

13:37.520 --> 13:39.761
Uh, Keith, Northeast Regional, again.

13:40.400 --> 13:43.290
Jack told us we would be selling
directly to businesses.

13:45.360 --> 13:47.567
- He did?
- Doug. I'm shadowing Keith.

13:47.680 --> 13:51.162
- Yes, he did.
- Definitely. I was there. Don, again.

13:51.400 --> 13:55.803
Well, I'm sorry for the misunderstanding,
because, um, the plan has always been

13:56.080 --> 14:00.051
um, entirely based on the freemium model,
like Dropbox?

14:00.120 --> 14:03.124
You know, you give the platform away free
to consumers,

14:03.200 --> 14:05.521
and then once you have
a big enough user-base,

14:05.600 --> 14:08.001
then you sell premium services to businesses.

14:08.080 --> 14:11.846
If we're giving it away now
and waiting until later to sell it,

14:11.920 --> 14:14.605
what are we doing here now?

14:16.440 --> 14:20.525
- I don't know. I don't know.
- We could maybe ask, uh, Jack

14:20.600 --> 14:23.206
when he gets back, uh, from wherever...

14:24.400 --> 14:27.051
Sorry, one second. Just one moment.

14:27.120 --> 14:28.724
Jack. Sorry, Jack.

14:28.880 --> 14:32.851
Sorry. Excuse me, Jack. Uh, are you leaving?

14:33.000 --> 14:35.367
Oh, I have this charity wine thing.

14:35.440 --> 14:39.365
Sorry, I committed to it months ago,
but you are killing it in there, Richard.

14:39.800 --> 14:42.167
Uh... Well, actually no.

14:42.240 --> 14:47.280
Sorry. They just said that you told them
that we would be business-facing?

14:47.360 --> 14:49.727
Oh, they filled you in. That's good.

14:49.800 --> 14:52.963
I was under the impression that
we would be consumer first.

14:53.040 --> 14:54.724
My guys are pretty set on that.

14:56.040 --> 14:58.088
Richard, I read your deck,

14:58.160 --> 15:01.209
and you project it'll be four years
until we get to revenue?

15:02.160 --> 15:03.571
Uh... Yeah.

15:03.640 --> 15:06.246
You know we're in a bubble right now, right?

15:06.320 --> 15:08.926
Or maybe you don't know.
You weren't around for the last bubble.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.445
You were probably in diapers.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.287
- I was 11.
- Well, I wasn't in diapers.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.011
I don't... I wasn't either.

15:15.080 --> 15:16.764
- I was there.
- Mmm-hmm.

15:16.840 --> 15:20.162
And in March of 2000, do you know
when a four-year plan ended?

15:21.920 --> 15:23.524
April of 2000.

15:24.520 --> 15:25.931
We gotta move, now.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.331
We can't put all of our eggs

15:27.400 --> 15:29.971
in the pot-of-gold-at-the-end-
of-the-rainbow basket.

15:31.360 --> 15:35.126
So, the pot of gold is in the basket?

15:35.200 --> 15:39.444
Richard, these are
the best salespeople in the world,

15:39.520 --> 15:42.046
and when they tell me
that business-facing is the play,

15:42.120 --> 15:43.531
I gotta listen to that, okay?

15:43.600 --> 15:45.967
- That's fair, but it's...
- I'm just asking you

15:46.040 --> 15:50.125
to talk to your guys about modifying
your platform for enterprise.

15:50.200 --> 15:53.044
I mean, just see how it feels, okay?

15:53.120 --> 15:55.726
And no matter what happens,
I promise you this.

15:56.040 --> 15:58.042
I will never compromise the product.

15:58.120 --> 15:59.963
Okay. Okay.

16:00.040 --> 16:04.125
Uh, fine, I will talk to my guys,
but they're not gonna be happy about it.

16:04.200 --> 16:06.009
No, of course not. They're engineers.

16:06.240 --> 16:07.571
I'll see you later.

16:07.840 --> 16:11.890
I realize this is a Japanese tradition
and that you are Chinese.

16:11.960 --> 16:13.803
I'm not racist.

16:13.880 --> 16:17.930
Yes, Japanese people racist.
They are horrible.

16:18.240 --> 16:19.480
No. No, no.

16:20.520 --> 16:25.401
Jian-Yang, in every relationship,
there are ebbs and flows.

16:26.280 --> 16:27.850
- Ebbs?
- Yes.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.251
And although we have flowed,

16:29.320 --> 16:33.484
our relationship now
has come to a permanent ebbing.

16:33.800 --> 16:36.246
- Flow.
- No. No.

16:38.280 --> 16:40.965
We have come to a permanent ebb.

16:41.040 --> 16:42.166
Do you understand?

16:43.560 --> 16:45.528
So, you want me to leave the house?

16:45.600 --> 16:48.046
Yes. Yes. Very much so.

16:49.760 --> 16:53.321
And so, I thank you for our today.

16:57.720 --> 16:58.721
Now you bow.

17:01.920 --> 17:03.046
Bow.

17:03.120 --> 17:04.451
All the way to the waist.

17:05.480 --> 17:06.481
No.

17:06.839 --> 17:07.921
Okay.

17:08.359 --> 17:09.486
Thank you, Erlich.

17:11.119 --> 17:14.089
Goodbye, little one. I'm gonna miss you.

17:17.720 --> 17:22.646
Can't say it wasn't fun, Jian-Yang,
you little Cantonese bastard.

17:25.800 --> 17:28.007
- Hey, you like this?
- What are you doing?

17:28.400 --> 17:32.007
Hi, my name's Erlich Bachman.
I'm a lying fuck!

17:32.120 --> 17:33.565
Who... Who are you yelling at?

17:33.960 --> 17:35.530
We're the only two people
in the fucking house!

17:35.600 --> 17:37.045
Erlich a liar!

17:37.160 --> 17:38.810
You're not gonna get me to change
my opinion about myself.

17:38.880 --> 17:39.847
- Liar!
- Take that outta there.

17:42.160 --> 17:44.606
I don't know, Richard.
I don't think it's that big a deal.

17:44.680 --> 17:47.081
Really, you don't?
You're okay with being business first?

17:47.160 --> 17:49.322
Granted, it's not what we would do
if we were in charge,

17:49.400 --> 17:51.721
but, you know,
Jack seems to know what he's doing.

17:53.240 --> 17:54.605
This is fucking amazing.

17:54.680 --> 17:56.284
<i>I feel</i> like <i>I'm in Minority Report.</i>

17:56.360 --> 17:58.761
And in reality, you're just a minority.

17:58.840 --> 18:01.446
Richard, relax.
We're still building the neural net.

18:01.520 --> 18:03.648
We still get to do all the cool stuff, right?

18:03.720 --> 18:04.846
Yeah, of course.

18:04.920 --> 18:07.241
We're not scrapping
any peer-to-peer delivery?

18:07.320 --> 18:09.084
No, no, definitely not.

18:09.160 --> 18:11.606
So, we're still doing the same stuff,
just in a different order.

18:11.680 --> 18:13.364
Yeah, I guess you're right.

18:13.440 --> 18:16.683
Well, the eviction process
is officially underway,

18:16.920 --> 18:19.844
but my attorney says it may take up to a year.

18:20.040 --> 18:22.566
- Where are you gonna stay?
- Well, I always have my trick.

18:24.640 --> 18:26.290
All right, I'll bite. What's your trick?

18:26.360 --> 18:30.684
I simply imagine that my skeleton is me,

18:30.760 --> 18:36.130
and my body is my house,
and that way, I'm always home.

18:38.040 --> 18:43.285
Okay. Well, uh, we are now business-facing.
I don't know if you heard.

18:43.360 --> 18:45.966
That means we have
to rewrite our entire deck.

18:46.040 --> 18:47.963
I just hope it doesn't
put us way the fuck behind.

18:48.040 --> 18:51.283
Behind who? EndFrame sucks
and Nucleus shit the bed, remember?

18:51.600 --> 18:53.204
Yeah, yeah.
You're right, you're right.

18:55.560 --> 18:56.721
Wow.

18:58.400 --> 19:00.641
This is endless.

19:00.720 --> 19:02.643
If we'd worked this hard
on Nucleus in the first place,

19:02.720 --> 19:04.484
we probably wouldn't
be scrubbing it right now.

19:05.360 --> 19:07.328
- Dude, are you done?
- Yup.

19:07.400 --> 19:09.289
How'd your script digest
all those strings so fast?

19:09.360 --> 19:11.681
I don't know. It's just a predictive loop.

19:11.760 --> 19:13.922
Actually, it's sort of like a context tree.

19:23.760 --> 19:24.886
Holy shit.

19:28.080 --> 19:29.081
What's up?

19:33.280 --> 19:35.282
Hey, Jared, why don't we knock off for tonight

19:35.400 --> 19:36.845
and just pick this back up tomorrow morning.

19:36.920 --> 19:38.365
Mmm. Agreed.

19:38.440 --> 19:41.728
I'm going on close to 40 hours
without good sleep,

19:41.800 --> 19:45.486
and the edges of things
are starting to get a little dancey.

19:45.560 --> 19:47.210
What?

19:47.280 --> 19:49.567
Erlich, thank you again
for allowing me to occupy

19:49.640 --> 19:51.722
a corner of your cozy garage.

19:51.800 --> 19:53.609
It is my hearth and my home.

19:53.880 --> 19:55.450
What the fuck?

19:55.960 --> 19:57.325
Jian-Yang, Jesus Christ.

19:57.400 --> 19:59.767
Don't sneak up on people like that,
you devious little bastard,

19:59.840 --> 20:02.047
especially if they're cleaning glassware.

20:02.120 --> 20:06.921
You kick me out, but you let him stay.
He's not even an incubee.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.526
No, he's not, and he's not staying
in the house.

20:09.600 --> 20:13.127
He's in the garage,
like a sad bag of potting soil.

20:13.200 --> 20:14.406
Have some compassion.

20:14.480 --> 20:18.121
I mean, the guy rented his place
to some fuckhead tenant who won't leave.

20:18.200 --> 20:20.362
Jared is fucked, Jian-Yang.

20:20.440 --> 20:21.885
He can go to the police.

20:21.960 --> 20:25.567
It's useless. California law gives landlords,
literally, no recourse.

20:25.640 --> 20:27.802
So, he can go to court.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.447
Of course, he's going to go to court,
you four-eyed turd.

20:31.720 --> 20:34.246
But in America, the legal system
doesn't work very well,

20:34.320 --> 20:38.120
so it will take at least a year
for the proceedings to even begin.

20:38.200 --> 20:39.690
Do you understand that?

20:39.800 --> 20:42.201
Yes. I stay here for one year.

20:43.040 --> 20:46.487
I pay no rent. You have no recourse.

20:49.200 --> 20:50.326
That's not always the case.

20:50.400 --> 20:52.129
I mean, sometimes court systems
can move faster,

20:52.200 --> 20:55.124
-especially if you have the money for...
- I'm going to smoke in my room.

20:55.200 --> 20:57.248
- Special occasion.
- Oh. Mother fuck.

20:57.520 --> 21:00.171
If we stack that same loop on top
of the bit-level encoder

21:00.240 --> 21:01.571
that we took from Hendricks,

21:01.800 --> 21:04.690
and then we tethered it to the routine
we were trying to use...

21:04.760 --> 21:06.808
That would be a huge jump in speed.

21:06.880 --> 21:07.927
This is mega.

21:08.160 --> 21:10.162
This is what Hendricks did
at TechCrunch Disrupt.

21:10.840 --> 21:12.888
I think we just cracked middle-out.

21:13.600 --> 21:15.841
We should probably tell Gavin, right?

21:15.960 --> 21:18.122
Why? He fired us.

21:18.760 --> 21:21.366
You know how much we could get paid
if we took this somewhere else?

21:27.280 --> 21:29.169
Fuck off.

21:33.880 --> 21:35.120
Okay, let me get this straight.

21:35.520 --> 21:37.488
First you talked me
into going business-facing,

21:37.560 --> 21:41.201
and now you want to eliminate the entire
neural net from the platform?

21:41.920 --> 21:43.809
Jan, Director, Inside Sales.
They call me "Jan the Man."

21:43.880 --> 21:45.564
Yes, we know, "Jan the Man."

21:45.640 --> 21:49.361
Listen, uh, we have to do neural net
for deep learning.

21:49.440 --> 21:51.647
Look, once we get enough data
flowing through the system,

21:51.720 --> 21:55.770
it will be able to recognize
long-range patterns and actually learn.

21:55.840 --> 21:58.810
It will be able to optimize our algorithm
on its own,

21:58.920 --> 22:02.049
increasing our already
superior speed and efficiency.

22:02.120 --> 22:04.248
Right? Pretty cool, huh?

22:04.320 --> 22:06.846
But it won't be able to do that if we delete it.

22:06.920 --> 22:08.729
- Do you get that?
- But you just said it.

22:08.800 --> 22:11.371
It requires a central repository of data, right?

22:11.440 --> 22:12.771
Businesses want to protect their data.

22:12.840 --> 22:14.888
They're huge pussies
when it comes to security.

22:14.960 --> 22:16.644
Okay, well, we're not cutting
machine learning. We're not.

22:16.720 --> 22:18.927
If we cut that, we might as well cut
peer-to-peer delivery,

22:19.000 --> 22:21.241
and all the efficiencies of the cloud.

22:21.440 --> 22:22.930
Are those still in?

22:23.000 --> 22:24.365
No, those have to go also.

22:24.440 --> 22:25.771
- What?
- Keith, by the way.

22:25.840 --> 22:27.604
I know your name, okay?
I know everybody's name.

22:27.680 --> 22:32.481
Look, uh, we can't cut everything about
this platform that makes it revolutionary

22:32.560 --> 22:34.927
just because that's a little harder for you guys
to sell, all right?

22:35.080 --> 22:37.606
If we want to sell out,
let's just sell all the way out.

22:37.720 --> 22:40.883
Let's just take the algorithm,
jam it into a metal fucking box,

22:40.960 --> 22:42.644
stick it in the back
of a data center somewhere,

22:42.720 --> 22:44.324
so it can't connect to anything,

22:44.400 --> 22:46.926
and it just sits there
and no one even knows it's there.

22:49.200 --> 22:50.531
Doug, still shadowing Keith.

22:50.600 --> 22:51.647
When you say "metal box,"

22:51.720 --> 22:53.961
you're talking about a rack-mounted
server-type appliance?

22:54.040 --> 22:58.648
No, no, no. lam using it
as a rhetorical example of a bad idea.

22:59.480 --> 23:00.925
That's fucking stupid.

23:01.320 --> 23:02.401
Oh, my God.

23:02.480 --> 23:04.005
I just need to find Jack. One second.

23:06.840 --> 23:08.808
- Where's Jack?
- He had to go meet his vet.

23:08.880 --> 23:13.488
His vet? In the middle of the day?
Okay, uh, well, what's the vet's address?

23:19.640 --> 23:21.244
Jack, excuse me. Do you mind telling me...

23:21.520 --> 23:23.966
Holy shit. What is that?

23:24.040 --> 23:26.646
- Oh, mother of God.
- Richard, what are you doing here?

23:26.840 --> 23:29.081
What do you mean? It's 2:30.
What are you doing here?

23:29.160 --> 23:33.290
My number one breeding mare went into heat.
Sorry, she's not much for schedules.

23:33.360 --> 23:34.407
Oh, God.

23:34.720 --> 23:38.202
Thoroughbreds, Richard. Natural cover only.

23:38.280 --> 23:40.248
Now, you don't see that very often, do you?

23:40.320 --> 23:41.321
Nope.Uh“.

23:42.520 --> 23:45.285
I had a meeting...
I had a meeting with the sales guys

23:45.400 --> 23:47.243
and, uh, Jan the Man...

23:47.840 --> 23:51.970
Uh... You know what? Can we talk over here?
This is just hard for me.

23:58.640 --> 24:01.450
Look, Jack, uh, you and I have a problem.

24:01.520 --> 24:04.888
Okay, your salespeople are telling me
to cut everything cool about the platform

24:04.960 --> 24:07.566
just because it's a little bit harder
for them to sell.

24:07.640 --> 24:12.043
But don't you think,
because they are such amazing salespeople,

24:12.120 --> 24:16.603
that it would be okay for them to sell
the harder stuff?

24:16.680 --> 24:19.047
No. It doesn't work that way.

24:19.120 --> 24:23.364
The way you keep the best salespeople is,
you need to give 'em something easy to sell.

24:23.880 --> 24:25.450
Otherwise, they'd just go somewhere else.

24:25.520 --> 24:28.808
Okay, well, uh, Pied Piper
could honestly be the global standard

24:28.880 --> 24:30.405
for file compression and storage.

24:30.480 --> 24:34.963
Every mobile device on the face of the planet
could be able to access their data

24:35.040 --> 24:37.520
as if they had a fiber optic cable
plugged into it.

24:37.600 --> 24:40.444
People in the desert,
people in refugee camps,

24:40.520 --> 24:43.729
people who have nothing
could suddenly have access to everything.

24:44.320 --> 24:46.163
You know, everybody in this industry,

24:46.240 --> 24:48.481
they say they want to make this world
a better place,

24:48.560 --> 24:50.324
but we could actually do it.

24:50.400 --> 24:52.971
We could do it and make billions of dollars.

24:53.200 --> 24:55.680
- Richard, listen...
- No, you listen to me, Jack.

24:55.760 --> 24:59.321
You promised me that you would
never compromise the product.

24:59.400 --> 25:02.404
So, do you feel like taking some action
and backing me up on this,

25:02.520 --> 25:05.922
because me and my product
feel pretty fucking compromised right now.

25:06.000 --> 25:09.368
Richard, I don't think you understand
what the product is.

25:09.440 --> 25:13.729
The product isn't the platform,
and the product isn't your algorithm, either.

25:13.800 --> 25:15.450
And it's not even the software.

25:15.680 --> 25:18.411
Do you know what
Pied Piper's product is, Richard?

25:20.000 --> 25:21.126
Is...

25:22.640 --> 25:23.641
Is it me?

25:24.400 --> 25:26.209
Oh, God! No!

25:26.280 --> 25:29.841
No. How could it possibly be you?
You got fired.

25:29.920 --> 25:32.526
Pied Piper's product is its stock.

25:33.240 --> 25:34.241
Its stock?

25:34.440 --> 25:37.011
And whatever makes
the value of that stock go up,

25:37.080 --> 25:38.889
that is what we are going to make.

25:38.960 --> 25:40.724
And maybe sometime in the future,

25:40.800 --> 25:43.167
we could change the world
and perform miracles,

25:43.240 --> 25:45.607
and all of that stuff, and I hope we do.

25:45.680 --> 25:46.886
But, like I told you before,

25:46.960 --> 25:48.849
I'm not going to mortgage
the present for that.

25:48.920 --> 25:50.729
I need to move the needle today.

25:51.320 --> 25:52.765
And now, if you will excuse me.

25:52.920 --> 25:57.528
I paid $150,000 for the semen
that's about to come out of that stallion,

25:57.600 --> 25:59.250
and I would very much like to be there

25:59.320 --> 26:00.731
to see that it happens.

26:02.880 --> 26:04.928
- Oh. Hey, Richard!
- Yes?

26:05.160 --> 26:08.403
I just got a text from Keith,
Northeast Regional.

26:08.480 --> 26:10.130
He says the guys love your idea.

26:10.800 --> 26:12.086
What idea?

26:12.960 --> 26:14.291
It's a <i>big</i> world,

26:14.360 --> 26:17.523
<i>but thanks to modern technology,
it's smaller than ever.</i>

26:17.600 --> 26:20.001
<i>Today, business moves at the speed of light.</i>

26:20.240 --> 26:23.767
<i>You can access your company's data
anywhere, anytime.</i>

26:23.840 --> 26:27.367
<i>But if you can get your data,
who else can get it?</i>

26:27.480 --> 26:31.769
<i>Spies, thieves, criminals, and foreigners.</i>

26:32.800 --> 26:35.644
<i>What if there was a way to take all
of your company's data</i>

26:35.720 --> 26:40.487
<i>and back it up in a protected enclosure
completely isolated from the world at large?</i>

26:40.600 --> 26:41.840
Oh, no.

26:41.920 --> 26:44.969
<i>The ultimate enterprise
data storage solution.</i>

26:47.640 --> 26:51.042
<i>Think inside the box.
Powered by Pied Piper.</i>

26:52.040 --> 26:54.247
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

26:54.640 --> 26:57.962
This is the game we're playing, team,
so, let's win it!

27:02.520 --> 27:03.806
You guys, check it out.

27:03.880 --> 27:07.601
Chef Amy hollowed out a watermelon
and filled it with watermelon Jell-O!

27:07.680 --> 27:09.523
Look, that's actual rind.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.571
The fuck is that? Is that a VCR?

27:12.840 --> 27:14.649
Why does it say "Pied Piper" on it?

27:14.720 --> 27:16.131
Why is everybody so happy?
