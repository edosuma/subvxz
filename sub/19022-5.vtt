WEBVTT

00:00.149 --> 00:01.952
Previously on "Six"...

00:01.955 --> 00:05.052
If we do not get $10
million in one week,

00:05.055 --> 00:06.964
I will cut his head off.

00:06.965 --> 00:08.867
We identified an abandoned village,

00:08.870 --> 00:11.726
which we believe may be where
the hostages are being held.

00:11.729 --> 00:14.691
But I don't want this SEAL
to distract you from our goal.

00:14.693 --> 00:16.804
We can use him. For the cause.

00:16.805 --> 00:18.634
The price is $10 million.

00:18.635 --> 00:22.054
I will agree to your price
if I see the SEAL first.

00:22.055 --> 00:23.634
Be advised... four-vehicle package

00:23.635 --> 00:25.174
moving north on north-south dirt road.

00:25.175 --> 00:26.940
Or it could be a kill team

00:26.943 --> 00:28.884
- coming in to take out the hostages.
- We'd be going in blind.

00:28.885 --> 00:30.534
It's day... zero tactical advantage.

00:30.537 --> 00:33.309
This is what we came
for... Rip and those girls.

00:33.312 --> 00:34.852
Going in... now.

00:40.965 --> 00:43.174
We got a man down
behind the southwest building.

00:43.175 --> 00:44.724
- How bad?
- He's urgent surgical.

00:49.425 --> 00:52.845
This is Delta One.
We need immediate CASEVAC.

00:55.465 --> 00:59.134
Reaper Two-Two, this
is Foxtrot Delta One.

00:59.135 --> 01:01.464
CASEVAC outbound, break.

01:01.467 --> 01:04.503
What does ISR have on vehicles
egressing from the north?

01:04.506 --> 01:06.587
Delta One, Reaper Three-Three.

01:06.588 --> 01:08.827
They are under tree cover at this time.

01:08.828 --> 01:10.037
Do not have visual.

01:10.038 --> 01:12.037
PJ said Buck was bleeding out.

01:12.038 --> 01:13.417
Just stay on task.

01:13.418 --> 01:16.087
Chase, Buddha, and I
will recheck the huts.

01:16.088 --> 01:18.917
Caulder, Fish, check for
bodies, gather intel...

01:18.918 --> 01:20.958
cellphones, whatever you can find.

01:23.788 --> 01:25.287
Bashir!

01:25.288 --> 01:27.128
_

01:27.256 --> 01:29.035
_

01:29.038 --> 01:30.828
Stay in the forest. The trees shield us.

01:30.831 --> 01:32.393
_

01:33.708 --> 01:35.408
They were Americans. I know it.

01:35.411 --> 01:37.497
If any of our men survived,
they will break them, Michael.

01:37.498 --> 01:38.667
We cannot stay in Africa.

01:38.668 --> 01:39.997
We take the hostages

01:39.998 --> 01:41.957
to the facility in Chad, as planned.

01:41.958 --> 01:44.457
Muttaqi will have us both
shot. We are dead men.

01:44.458 --> 01:46.167
Is the stupid SEAL worth that?

01:46.168 --> 01:48.497
Yes. He is.

01:48.498 --> 01:51.418
Muttaqi will understand,
even if you don't.

01:58.086 --> 01:59.215
Who are they?

01:59.216 --> 02:00.465
I don't know,

02:00.466 --> 02:01.965
but they know what they're doing.

02:01.966 --> 02:03.585
And that gunfire after, what was that?

02:03.586 --> 02:05.346
No talking!

02:14.346 --> 02:16.085
You ever see an AK rigged like this?

02:16.086 --> 02:18.795
Look at his kit.

02:18.796 --> 02:21.465
These shit-birds aren't BH.

02:21.466 --> 02:22.545
How many?

02:22.546 --> 02:24.465
Eight.

02:24.466 --> 02:29.215
These are soldiers...
trained, geared up, armored.

02:29.216 --> 02:31.295
We got eight confirmed Kilos,

02:31.296 --> 02:35.045
at least one with comms, rail
system on his gun, lasers.

02:35.046 --> 02:38.385
All right, bag him and
take him to the safe house.

02:38.386 --> 02:40.136
Roger.

02:48.966 --> 02:51.965
Poor girls, man.

02:51.966 --> 02:53.635
Bag the bowl.

02:53.636 --> 02:56.045
We need to gather DNA
evidence, see if Rip was here.

02:56.046 --> 02:57.295
Roger that.

03:01.346 --> 03:03.505
Delta One, this is Foxtrot Two-Two.

03:03.506 --> 03:06.965
ISR unable to locate vehicles
departing the target area.

03:06.966 --> 03:08.715
Will notify if this changes.

03:08.716 --> 03:10.586
Roger that.

03:12.000 --> 03:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:29.886 --> 03:33.175
Look at this. Rip was here.

03:33.176 --> 03:35.045
We just missed him.

03:35.046 --> 03:37.005
All stations, this is Delta One.

03:37.006 --> 03:39.345
We have confirmation that
Taggart was just here. Over.

03:39.346 --> 03:41.135
Foxtrot Two-Two copies.

03:41.136 --> 03:43.675
Be advised... the
Nigerian army is en route.

03:43.676 --> 03:45.845
- You have 10 minutes.
- Roger that.

03:45.846 --> 03:48.085
All right, Delta, let's...
let's wrap this up.

03:48.086 --> 03:49.770
We got to get out of here.

03:49.773 --> 03:51.028
Delta One, Delta Four.

03:51.031 --> 03:53.942
Found a fresh grave on east
side of building one-one. Over.

03:55.474 --> 03:58.143
Over here!

03:58.144 --> 04:00.013
We need a shovel.

04:00.014 --> 04:01.103
We have to move, man.

04:01.104 --> 04:03.843
Give me a goddamn shovel.

04:03.844 --> 04:07.263
Come on, help me. It could be Rip.

04:07.264 --> 04:09.014
All right.

04:10.974 --> 04:13.394
I got him. Come on!

04:16.764 --> 04:18.142
Come on.

04:18.144 --> 04:20.843
It's not Rip.

04:20.844 --> 04:22.554
Neither is this one.

04:25.724 --> 04:26.683
Let's get 'em out!

04:50.144 --> 04:51.973
Foxtrot Two-Two, this is Delta One.

04:51.974 --> 04:53.764
Do we have sitrep on the CASEVAC? Over.

04:57.069 --> 05:01.279
Delta One, Foxtrot Two-Two.
Your wounded is now KIA.

05:02.644 --> 05:04.604
Roger that.

05:11.613 --> 05:13.613
Buck didn't make it.

05:49.466 --> 05:51.045
Hey, boys!

05:51.046 --> 05:53.585
Damn.

05:53.586 --> 05:55.386
We beat the chaplain.

05:58.926 --> 06:00.886
I got this from here.

06:03.176 --> 06:05.045
Where's that asshole husband of mine?

06:16.296 --> 06:19.216
No! No! No!

06:22.839 --> 06:24.419
Oh, my God.

06:29.386 --> 06:30.585
Here's his Texas flag, Tammi.

06:30.586 --> 06:31.966
No.

06:33.506 --> 06:34.505
No.

06:34.506 --> 06:35.636
No!

06:58.887 --> 07:03.127
_

07:41.426 --> 07:43.755
What's wrong?

07:43.756 --> 07:45.386
Nothing.

07:52.256 --> 07:53.465
Richard.

07:53.466 --> 07:55.676
Richard!

08:20.320 --> 08:22.030
You're up, Bear?

08:25.570 --> 08:26.819
We got your back.

08:26.820 --> 08:27.910
Gotcha.

08:42.780 --> 08:44.974
- Joe, how you doing?
- Good to go, sir.

08:44.977 --> 08:46.409
Remember Captain Pearson?

08:46.410 --> 08:50.560
Wanted to talk to you about
how things went down in Nigeria.

08:50.563 --> 08:52.359
Talk us through your decision-making

08:52.360 --> 08:53.699
up to Buckley's death.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.109
Yes, sir.

08:55.110 --> 08:57.649
ISR identified a group of vehicles

08:57.650 --> 08:59.529
heading toward the target compound.

08:59.532 --> 09:01.082
Reaper Two-Two, Foxtrot Delta One.

09:01.085 --> 09:02.383
Roger that. I see them.

09:02.386 --> 09:04.586
I tracked them on the Rover.

09:05.280 --> 09:07.029
When we lost them in the trees,

09:07.030 --> 09:09.149
I made the call to
move to site immediately

09:09.150 --> 09:10.359
and continue the rescue.

09:10.360 --> 09:12.188
The hostages could've been in danger.

09:12.191 --> 09:14.855
One of the hostages
could've been at risk.

09:14.858 --> 09:17.067
While approaching the target,

09:17.070 --> 09:20.279
we encountered resistance
from an organized force.

09:20.280 --> 09:25.239
We engaged, and at this
point, Buckley was wounded.

09:25.240 --> 09:27.319
Could you have aborted
the mission earlier

09:27.320 --> 09:29.949
when you were notified of
unidentified vehicles on target?

09:29.950 --> 09:32.699
Reaper Two-Two, Foxtrot Delta
One. Do you still have them?

09:32.700 --> 09:34.609
Negative. We lost them when
they reached the target area.

09:34.610 --> 09:36.319
- Could be nothing.
- Or it could be a kill team

09:36.320 --> 09:37.699
coming in to take out the hostages.

09:37.700 --> 09:39.649
We'd be going in blind.

09:39.650 --> 09:41.450
It's clear you didn't
have tactical advantage.

09:43.280 --> 09:45.029
Going in... now.

09:45.030 --> 09:46.859
Were you being too aggressive?

09:46.860 --> 09:49.110
Foxtrot Delta One. We
have troops in contact.

09:51.890 --> 09:53.609
Were you being too aggressive?

09:53.610 --> 09:55.949
No, sir. No such thing.

09:55.950 --> 09:58.239
No such thing?

09:58.240 --> 10:02.992
This command relies on
you exercising restraint

10:02.995 --> 10:04.535
when appropriate.

10:05.826 --> 10:07.496
Can you do that?

10:10.530 --> 10:12.609
Yes, sir.

10:12.610 --> 10:14.109
Hey, look at me, pretty eyes.

10:14.110 --> 10:15.409
I made that call.

10:15.410 --> 10:17.448
- How bad?
- He's urgent surgical.

10:17.451 --> 10:21.359
We had good intel that Rip
and the hostages were in there.

10:21.360 --> 10:23.995
And you still think it
was the right call to make?

10:29.110 --> 10:30.700
Yes, sir, I do.

10:40.272 --> 10:42.409
- Daddy!
- Dad!

10:42.410 --> 10:44.069
Hey.

10:44.070 --> 10:46.609
Hey, hey!

10:46.610 --> 10:48.722
Oh, missed you guys.

10:53.070 --> 10:55.319
I told them about Buck.

10:56.037 --> 10:57.786
Are you okay, Dad?

10:57.789 --> 10:58.880
Sure. I'm fine.

10:58.883 --> 11:00.569
I don't want it to be you, Dad.

11:00.570 --> 11:01.949
It's never gonna be me.

11:01.950 --> 11:03.859
I'm bulletproof, buddy, remember?

11:07.860 --> 11:10.037
Why don't you guys go to the Dairy Queen

11:10.040 --> 11:12.449
and get yourself a treat, okay?

11:12.450 --> 11:14.410
Come on, RJ.

11:25.110 --> 11:26.489
Oh, Papi.

11:26.490 --> 11:27.610
Oh, yeah.

11:30.860 --> 11:32.150
SÃ­.

11:41.990 --> 11:43.569
What's the matter?

12:02.820 --> 12:05.649
What was he like... Buckley?

12:05.650 --> 12:08.989
Was an asshole who believed in aliens.

12:08.990 --> 12:11.103
Hmm. You don't?

12:15.030 --> 12:18.200
What did I tell you about unpacking?

12:22.240 --> 12:25.149
It's okay to open up about
what happened, you know.

12:26.009 --> 12:29.009
Shouldn't your mother be home soon?

12:30.360 --> 12:32.069
You know...

12:32.070 --> 12:38.779
my best friend, Trevor,
committed suicide a year ago.

12:38.780 --> 12:45.239
Did it with a shotgun,
so it was a closed casket.

12:45.240 --> 12:49.319
I didn't get to see his face, but...

12:49.320 --> 12:52.780
I needed to, you know?

12:55.619 --> 12:58.222
I made a video for him
with pictures and music.

12:58.225 --> 13:00.279
I could do the same
thing for your friend,

13:00.280 --> 13:02.730
maybe show it at the
funeral or something?

13:04.402 --> 13:05.860
Maybe.

13:08.700 --> 13:10.359
I'm gonna need some pictures.

13:10.360 --> 13:12.700
You don't have very many.

13:23.298 --> 13:24.837
How you doing?

13:24.840 --> 13:26.698
I'm fine.

13:26.701 --> 13:28.976
The wives are coming over
soon to prep for tomorrow.

13:28.979 --> 13:30.518
We could use a little help.

13:30.521 --> 13:32.271
I packed up most of
his stuff from his cage.

13:33.463 --> 13:37.292
So much crap in here.
Wonder why he kept it.

13:37.295 --> 13:39.545
You want me to take it to Tammi's?

13:41.200 --> 13:44.029
I'm supposed to take care of my men.

13:44.030 --> 13:47.359
I'm supposed to be the
...damn good shepherd.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.239
- It's not your fault.
- You don't know that.

13:49.240 --> 13:51.240
- It's not your fault, Joe.
- You don't know that!

14:08.172 --> 14:12.449
Buck wore this trident on his uniform.

14:12.450 --> 14:14.819
All SEALs do.

14:14.820 --> 14:18.426
For me, this trident...

14:20.950 --> 14:26.150
stands for what we're
willing to pay, all of us...

14:28.367 --> 14:30.037
for each other.

14:32.360 --> 14:34.280
And today Buck picked up that tab.

14:39.216 --> 14:40.336
I...

14:53.485 --> 14:55.245
Vaya con Dios, amigo.

14:58.712 --> 15:02.149
_

15:02.150 --> 15:03.884
I'll miss you, brother.

15:05.410 --> 15:06.486
Till Valhalla.

15:22.384 --> 15:24.764
Patch-wearers only.

15:29.054 --> 15:31.303
Got the rest of Buck's will here,

15:31.304 --> 15:33.989
and I'm, uh, gonna read it to you,

15:33.992 --> 15:36.633
and you can decide what
you want to do about it.

15:36.634 --> 15:40.053
"I, Beauregard Jefferson Davis Buckley,

15:40.054 --> 15:45.133
being of sound mind
and... superlative body,

15:45.134 --> 15:49.883
in the event of getting killed,
likely in heroic fashion..."

15:51.554 --> 15:54.513
"...task my SEAL brothers
with one final mission.

15:54.514 --> 15:57.213
They must shoot my bodily
remains from a cannon

15:57.214 --> 15:59.843
at Malvern Hill Civil War battlefield."

15:59.844 --> 16:02.213
Freakin' Buckley.

16:02.214 --> 16:05.469
"And make sure my daddy comes,
too, that son of a bitch."

16:05.472 --> 16:07.053
Well, hell, we're gonna need a map.

16:07.054 --> 16:09.593
And a cannon and, uh,
tactical gear and NVGs.

16:09.594 --> 16:12.213
They have a cannon. They
shoot one off every year.

16:12.214 --> 16:14.553
- Yeah, right.
- Let's do it.

16:14.554 --> 16:16.593
Well, boys, you heard the man.

16:16.594 --> 16:18.923
All right, fellas.

16:18.924 --> 16:21.263
Any news on Rip and the girls?

16:21.264 --> 16:23.865
When there is, you'll be
the first to know, Joe.

16:23.868 --> 16:26.077
And, uh, Captain Pearson,
what did he say about me?

16:26.078 --> 16:27.907
The best thing that you can do right now

16:27.908 --> 16:29.407
is be there for your team, Joe.

16:29.408 --> 16:30.658
Yes, sir.

16:42.748 --> 16:44.867
Look at this.

16:44.868 --> 16:48.407
Sources have confirmed
this was indeed a failed

16:48.408 --> 16:51.867
U.S. Special Operations
rescue of several Americans,

16:51.868 --> 16:54.497
including former Navy
SEAL Richard Taggart,

16:54.498 --> 16:55.787
as well as the kidnapped schoolgirls...

16:55.788 --> 16:57.287
You shouldn't have brought them here.

16:57.290 --> 16:58.497
This is our training facility.

16:58.500 --> 17:00.657
Sources indicate scores
were killed in the raid,

17:00.658 --> 17:03.457
including a U.S. Special
Operations soldier.

17:03.460 --> 17:05.489
See, Akmal.

17:05.492 --> 17:07.577
Everything we've been working for.

17:07.578 --> 17:10.698
And it's only the beginning.

17:13.617 --> 17:16.196
How's recruiting coming?

17:16.198 --> 17:18.957
You were right about the Oregon girl.

17:18.958 --> 17:20.957
- Marissa.
- She's online.

17:20.958 --> 17:22.577
Keeps asking when she
can talk to you again.

17:22.578 --> 17:23.958
Bring her up.

17:25.698 --> 17:29.867
There's my girl. How are you, Marissa?

17:29.868 --> 17:33.117
I can't see you. I want to see you.

17:33.118 --> 17:35.037
Not yet.

17:35.038 --> 17:37.327
Hey, that jersey looks great.

17:37.328 --> 17:39.197
You like it?

17:39.198 --> 17:42.247
Kashif tells me you're ready
for some more responsibility.

17:42.248 --> 17:44.157
Are you studying the Hadith?

17:44.160 --> 17:45.601
Mashallah.

17:47.118 --> 17:49.537
I want to make you happy.

17:49.538 --> 17:52.498
Tell me about your day.

17:54.994 --> 17:57.117
Dude, where are the Jell-O
shots when you need them?

17:57.118 --> 17:58.117
I don't know.

17:58.118 --> 17:59.288
Hey, Alex.

18:00.868 --> 18:03.907
Did you bring a date to this?

18:03.908 --> 18:07.787
I mean, that is a new
low... even for you.

18:07.788 --> 18:10.117
- She looks like she's in high school.
- She is.

18:10.118 --> 18:13.578
So, there might be some
more photos for the video?

18:15.118 --> 18:16.957
Bear, you remember Dharma.

18:18.091 --> 18:19.841
Mm!

18:20.578 --> 18:24.197
Dharma. Right.

18:24.198 --> 18:28.077
Yeah, I-I don't think
I've seen you since, uh...

18:28.078 --> 18:29.538
Birth?

18:30.655 --> 18:31.905
I'm kidding.

18:34.658 --> 18:36.577
I'm really sorry about your friend.

18:36.578 --> 18:39.327
Yeah. Yeah, we're...

18:39.328 --> 18:41.907
We're firing him out of a cannon.

18:41.908 --> 18:43.327
Out of a cannon.

18:43.328 --> 18:44.407
That is dope!

18:44.408 --> 18:45.497
Yeah.

18:45.498 --> 18:46.457
Can I come?

18:46.458 --> 18:48.037
- No way.
- No. No.

18:48.038 --> 18:50.037
She looks just like
Alex, don't you think?

18:50.038 --> 18:51.537
Photos?

18:51.538 --> 18:53.617
Oh, yeah. Uh, the box
of Buckley's stuff?

18:53.618 --> 18:54.657
Right this way.

18:54.658 --> 18:56.158
- Thank you, Lena.
- Mm-hmm.

19:14.408 --> 19:16.617
Testing.

19:16.618 --> 19:19.037
I love you, Tammi.

19:19.038 --> 19:20.409
I do. I just...

19:21.868 --> 19:23.657
I don't know if I can trust you.

19:23.658 --> 19:25.958
Awkward.

19:33.458 --> 19:36.407
I just can't decide.

19:36.408 --> 19:41.497
Could you... Could
you come and help?

19:41.498 --> 19:43.458
I'm sorry.

19:43.461 --> 19:46.961
Just... I can't be
alone right now.

19:48.618 --> 19:49.787
What'd you find?

19:49.788 --> 19:52.867
Nothing. I'm...

19:52.868 --> 19:55.247
I think I have all the photos I need.

19:55.248 --> 19:57.198
Cool. We're starting up the grill.

20:03.038 --> 20:05.497
One thing I didn't know about Buckley

20:05.498 --> 20:07.827
was that he had this special affinity

20:07.828 --> 20:09.747
for something called NASCAR.

20:12.078 --> 20:14.658
And, uh, that his hair
was always perfect.

20:17.595 --> 20:22.645
What I do know is that he is my brother.

20:25.498 --> 20:29.197
Sir, ma'am...

20:29.198 --> 20:31.907
I am truly sorry for your loss.

20:31.908 --> 20:34.157
Thank you, son.

20:34.158 --> 20:35.748
Uh, Tammi.

20:44.288 --> 20:47.117
I don't know what to say.

20:47.118 --> 20:49.287
Honestly...

20:49.288 --> 20:52.498
I was always glad that I
wasn't standing up here.

20:56.484 --> 20:57.734
But now I am.

21:01.498 --> 21:03.867
Dharma, let's play that video now.

21:03.868 --> 21:04.958
Right.

21:08.908 --> 21:10.248
It's all about the hair.

21:18.368 --> 21:20.117
There we go.

21:40.198 --> 21:42.197
- To Buck!
- Buck.

21:42.198 --> 21:43.342
- To Buck!
- Buck.

21:56.288 --> 21:58.038
He's ready.

22:25.868 --> 22:28.497
What I want to know is how's a man

22:28.498 --> 22:31.957
who is in the best
special-ops team in the world

22:31.958 --> 22:35.117
end up as a burned-out security guard

22:35.118 --> 22:36.997
in ass-nowhere Nigeria.

22:36.998 --> 22:38.537
Who are you?

22:38.538 --> 22:40.327
- You don't recognize me?
- Should I?

22:40.328 --> 22:42.997
You famous on YouTube
for sucking a camel's dick?

22:45.578 --> 22:47.907
You know, comedians are dark, man.

22:47.908 --> 22:50.747
Inside, most of them are
crying their eyes out.

22:50.748 --> 22:53.457
Those girls you
kidnapped, they need water,

22:53.458 --> 22:56.747
they need food, and
they need clean clothes.

22:56.748 --> 23:00.247
You think I kidnapped them.

23:00.248 --> 23:03.157
I think I saved them.

23:03.158 --> 23:05.461
It's all semantics, isn't it?

23:05.464 --> 23:09.254
But they're taken care
of. We're not Boko Haram.

23:11.658 --> 23:14.457
We never really got around
to introducing each other.

23:14.458 --> 23:16.037
I'm Michael.

23:16.038 --> 23:20.457
That's Akmal, ex-Spetsnaz,
and straight-up OG.

23:20.458 --> 23:22.617
So that's us.

23:22.618 --> 23:25.957
Why don't you tell us
something about you?

23:25.958 --> 23:28.197
No?

23:28.198 --> 23:32.247
You know, I remember
you being this giant...

23:32.248 --> 23:36.247
helmet, goggles...
this mythical monster.

23:36.248 --> 23:38.142
You get an idea about
something in your head,

23:38.145 --> 23:40.799
thinking about it over
and over, building it up,

23:40.802 --> 23:43.997
and then, well...

23:43.998 --> 23:46.078
now look at you.

23:47.958 --> 23:52.327
Got to say, it's... a disappointment.

23:52.328 --> 23:55.197
You got me mixed up with someone else.

23:55.198 --> 23:58.657
Oh? Okay.

23:58.658 --> 24:03.037
How about we play famous last words?

24:03.038 --> 24:05.407
I'll start.

24:05.408 --> 24:09.665
"What an artist dies in me."

24:10.538 --> 24:14.748
Anything? Anybody?

24:16.526 --> 24:18.026
The emperor Nero.

24:22.368 --> 24:24.157
How about this one?

24:24.158 --> 24:29.867
"He's just a raghead driver,
doesn't speak any English."

24:29.868 --> 24:32.617
Anything?

24:32.618 --> 24:34.407
No.

24:34.408 --> 24:39.157
My brother... Omar. He was a good kid.

24:39.158 --> 24:42.367
From Detroit, remember?

24:42.368 --> 24:45.037
He loved the Lakers because of Kobe.

24:45.038 --> 24:48.658
That's what he told you...

24:50.700 --> 24:57.958
an unarmed kid who'd surrendered
right before you murdered him.

25:00.998 --> 25:03.197
What did you do with the body?

25:03.198 --> 25:05.787
Did you even have the
decency to bury him,

25:05.788 --> 25:07.998
or did you just throw him in the trash?

25:10.376 --> 25:12.086
I remember now.

25:14.658 --> 25:17.657
I made a mistake.

25:17.658 --> 25:19.498
I'm sorry.

25:21.949 --> 25:25.457
I'm sorry I didn't kill
all of you motherfuckers.

25:25.458 --> 25:28.117
So you do whatever it is you got to do.

25:28.118 --> 25:30.368
Just spare me the moral justification.

25:34.748 --> 25:36.697
Good talk.

25:36.698 --> 25:38.158
We'll finish it later.

26:06.473 --> 26:11.592
It was a one-in-a-million
shot, Bear, an act of God.

26:11.593 --> 26:14.142
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah,
it was an act of God.

26:14.143 --> 26:15.691
Hey.

26:15.694 --> 26:17.730
The enemy gets a vote, too.

26:17.733 --> 26:20.853
Sometimes, it goes against us.

26:24.664 --> 26:26.413
Come on.

26:28.218 --> 26:30.295
We've got a mission to do.

26:32.956 --> 26:35.335
Here it is here. There's the field.

26:35.336 --> 26:37.625
The cannon is near the hills. Big boom.

26:37.626 --> 26:39.125
So why Malvern Hill?

26:39.126 --> 26:41.455
His great-great-granddaddy died there.

26:41.456 --> 26:43.375
Right. The, uh... The general.

26:43.376 --> 26:45.745
- Yeah, he told me about it.
- That's right.

26:45.746 --> 26:46.955
- Cullen?
- Yeah.

26:46.956 --> 26:48.455
He was a buck private.

26:48.456 --> 26:50.205
Private! He was a private.

26:50.206 --> 26:51.995
Oh!

26:51.996 --> 26:53.205
19 years old.

26:54.416 --> 26:56.335
Having fun, boys?

26:56.336 --> 26:58.625
Yep.

26:58.626 --> 27:01.335
Gentlemen, I have something for you.

27:01.336 --> 27:04.745
It's my husband, good old Buck.

27:04.746 --> 27:07.455
Well, some of him, anyway.

27:07.456 --> 27:11.666
Fresh baked. Straight from the oven.

27:15.416 --> 27:17.166
We'll take care of
him, Tammi. I promise.

27:19.206 --> 27:20.955
Like you did out there?

27:20.956 --> 27:23.205
Huh, Joe?

27:23.854 --> 27:27.103
Hey. Come on, let's get some fresh air.

27:27.106 --> 27:28.295
Don't touch me.

27:28.296 --> 27:30.666
I have every right to be
shit-faced, same as all of you.

27:33.706 --> 27:35.125
Hey.

27:35.126 --> 27:38.085
This lady can do whatever she wants.

27:38.086 --> 27:40.296
Hey, this isn't any
of your business, man.

27:44.118 --> 27:47.237
This makes it my business.

27:47.246 --> 27:49.665
A Glock? Really?

27:49.666 --> 27:53.165
Hey, Buddha, how many people
did you kill the other day?

27:53.166 --> 27:54.665
Two.

27:54.666 --> 27:56.415
Fish, how about you?

27:56.416 --> 27:59.915
One. It was from 200 yards out.

27:59.916 --> 28:01.795
Hell of a shot.

28:01.796 --> 28:05.495
Me, I killed three for,
what, Chase, 20 bucks an hour?

28:05.496 --> 28:08.415
Well, given the travel
time, we're looking at $18.

28:08.416 --> 28:11.705
See, we don't do it for the money.

28:11.706 --> 28:13.835
Neither did our buddy.

28:13.836 --> 28:16.900
See, he didn't die for money or you

28:16.903 --> 28:21.705
or whatever it is you wannabe
GI Joes do for a living

28:21.706 --> 28:24.586
or the flag or the stock market.

28:26.666 --> 28:31.665
He died for us, and we'd die for him.

28:31.666 --> 28:34.536
We'd kill for him, too.

28:41.145 --> 28:44.105
Don't worry about the beers. I got 'em.

28:53.036 --> 28:54.745
Light discipline, assholes.

28:54.746 --> 28:56.495
- Tactical!
- Going tactical!

29:06.796 --> 29:08.706
Somebody responsible!

29:09.836 --> 29:11.335
Let's blow it!

29:11.336 --> 29:12.295
Yeah, yeah. But how?

29:12.296 --> 29:13.745
I got a video.

29:13.746 --> 29:16.415
Okay, give it to Bear.

29:16.416 --> 29:18.165
Here, press play.

29:18.166 --> 29:20.118
Number one man, Caulder,
clears the barrel.

29:20.121 --> 29:21.455
Got it.

29:21.456 --> 29:22.955
The barrel... clear!

29:22.956 --> 29:24.745
- Number two man, Chase.
- Yep.

29:24.746 --> 29:25.835
Add the gunpowder.

29:25.836 --> 29:26.955
Roger that.

29:26.956 --> 29:29.415
- Little Fishy.
- Yeah?

29:29.416 --> 29:31.625
Number three man adds the pin.

29:31.626 --> 29:32.725
Set!

29:32.728 --> 29:35.875
Okay, number four man,
Ortiz, add the shell.

29:35.876 --> 29:37.745
- What?
- Add the shell.

29:37.746 --> 29:38.904
You got the shell.

29:38.907 --> 29:40.412
What shell? Nobody
told me to bring nada.

29:40.414 --> 29:41.513
Where's the shell, Buddha?

29:41.516 --> 29:42.946
Hey, nobody... nobody told
me I had to bring a shell.

29:42.948 --> 29:44.930
You got to be me, Buddha.

29:44.933 --> 29:46.705
Hey, hey.

29:46.706 --> 29:48.205
Aw, that's... Nah,
that's not gonna work.

29:48.206 --> 29:49.835
- Bag of Buck. Right here.
- Bag of Buck.

29:49.836 --> 29:51.295
Here we go. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:51.296 --> 29:52.666
Nice and gentle. Nice and gentle.

29:54.246 --> 29:56.085
To Buck.

29:56.086 --> 29:58.085
And every brother who never came home.

29:58.086 --> 29:59.875
- To Buck!
- Buck!

29:59.876 --> 30:01.455
To Rip.

30:01.456 --> 30:02.795
Who's still out there.

30:02.796 --> 30:04.375
- To Rip!
- To Rip!

30:04.376 --> 30:05.705
- To Rip!
- Rip.

30:05.706 --> 30:07.085
Brothers.

30:13.296 --> 30:16.085
Maybe it was this...

30:16.086 --> 30:17.665
Shit!

31:05.666 --> 31:06.955
Mr. Rip!

31:06.956 --> 31:08.125
Ah!

31:08.126 --> 31:10.035
- Is everybody okay?
- Yes.

31:10.036 --> 31:11.335
Huh? You okay?

31:11.336 --> 31:13.625
Yes. We have beds and food.

31:13.626 --> 31:15.165
We have books, too.

31:15.166 --> 31:16.955
They've been nice.

31:16.956 --> 31:20.415
They asked me to keep
teaching the girls.

31:20.416 --> 31:22.483
Girls, would you...

31:22.486 --> 31:25.026
Would you finish your coloring?

31:28.766 --> 31:31.141
Who are these people? Do you know?

31:31.144 --> 31:31.875
No.

31:31.876 --> 31:34.625
Mr. Rip. Look. It is all of us.

31:34.626 --> 31:37.375
There's you, teacher Na'omi.

31:37.376 --> 31:39.835
You think this looks like me?

31:39.836 --> 31:42.795
Of course it looks like
you! Why wouldn't it?

31:47.666 --> 31:49.416
I like it.

31:55.521 --> 31:58.270
- 10-4!
- Play nice!

32:06.916 --> 32:09.285
My son would've loved this.

32:09.286 --> 32:10.576
Yes, he would.

32:14.786 --> 32:17.035
I've been running it
over and over in my head

32:17.036 --> 32:18.415
if there was anything

32:18.416 --> 32:20.116
that I could've done to have saved him.

32:26.749 --> 32:30.128
I was in the 101st.

32:30.131 --> 32:31.830
Vietnam.

32:31.833 --> 32:33.083
Yeah.

32:35.584 --> 32:37.633
I lost seven men.

32:37.634 --> 32:39.923
That was 50 years ago.

32:39.924 --> 32:43.963
Not a day goes by I
don't think about 'em.

32:43.964 --> 32:47.253
These decisions...

32:47.254 --> 32:50.213
most men never have to face.

32:50.214 --> 32:52.633
But if you do make them,

32:52.634 --> 32:56.173
you've got to make peace with them.

32:56.174 --> 33:00.423
Right here, right now.

33:00.424 --> 33:02.708
'Cause if you hold on to 'em like...

33:02.711 --> 33:04.120
like I did,

33:04.123 --> 33:06.752
they're just gonna tear you apart...

33:06.755 --> 33:09.585
tear apart your family.

33:33.425 --> 33:35.174
After you do this,
you let those girls go.

33:35.177 --> 33:36.176
That's all I ask.

33:36.179 --> 33:38.213
Do what?

33:38.214 --> 33:41.583
Oh, you think I'm
gonna cut your head off

33:41.584 --> 33:43.004
and post it online?

33:43.007 --> 33:45.716
Come on, dude.

33:45.719 --> 33:48.429
That's so clichÃ©.

33:53.722 --> 33:56.762
I just need you to read
this for the camera.

33:58.870 --> 34:01.080
Look it over and let me
know when you're ready.

34:05.012 --> 34:07.725
I took a lot of time with that.

34:07.728 --> 34:09.099
You know, most of these things,

34:09.101 --> 34:10.536
you can tell they're coerced...

34:10.540 --> 34:13.248
you know, bad grammar,
no sense of style or flow.

34:13.252 --> 34:17.058
They're just checking off boxes
on the terrorist checklist.

34:17.061 --> 34:20.243
You know what's missing? Sincerity.

34:20.246 --> 34:21.916
Why'd you let your
brother take that bullet?

34:21.918 --> 34:23.228
How does it feel

34:23.232 --> 34:25.166
knowing you stood by
doing absolutely nothing?

34:29.302 --> 34:32.101
I will never forgive myself.

34:32.101 --> 34:33.261
Ever.

34:33.262 --> 34:36.301
Good.

34:36.302 --> 34:39.221
But I might forgive you.

34:39.222 --> 34:41.391
- Just pick up the paper.
- You pick it up.

34:41.391 --> 34:45.761
Tell me, what do you call innocents

34:45.762 --> 34:47.277
that get caught up in our conflict...

34:47.280 --> 34:50.259
you know, women, children, civilians?

34:50.262 --> 34:51.721
Collateral damage, right?

34:51.722 --> 34:53.391
That's above my pay grade.

34:53.391 --> 34:54.641
Right. Collateral.

34:54.641 --> 34:56.341
I looked it up in the OED...

34:56.342 --> 34:59.011
parallel, side by side,
related but different.

34:59.012 --> 35:01.141
The families on a boardwalk in Nice,

35:01.142 --> 35:03.301
the guests at a wedding
in Afghanistan...

35:03.302 --> 35:04.971
a bomb strapped to a chest,

35:04.972 --> 35:06.721
a drone controlled from Nevada...

35:06.722 --> 35:08.971
Boom!

35:08.974 --> 35:12.681
Both dead and gone thanks to us.

35:12.682 --> 35:15.051
Is that a fancy way of
saying that I'm like you?

35:15.052 --> 35:16.221
Well, I'm not.

35:16.222 --> 35:17.971
So you take your OED,

35:17.972 --> 35:20.722
and you shove it up your terrorist...

35:29.392 --> 35:31.841
Hey, Akmal.

35:31.842 --> 35:34.601
Show him.

35:34.602 --> 35:37.641
Hi, Esther.

35:37.642 --> 35:39.931
Say hello to Mr. Rip.

35:39.932 --> 35:41.801
Hi, Mr. Rip.

35:41.802 --> 35:45.421
Na'omi can't say hello.
We had to gag her.

35:45.424 --> 35:48.929
Na'omi, you can nod.

35:48.932 --> 35:52.552
Akmal, show us what Esther
and Na'omi are wearing.

35:54.682 --> 35:57.891
It's a bit dramatic,
but that's the idea.

35:57.892 --> 36:00.391
Akmal has the detonator to these.

36:00.392 --> 36:01.971
You ready, Akmal?

36:01.972 --> 36:04.262
Just give me the word.

36:05.712 --> 36:07.582
Hey!

36:12.472 --> 36:13.681
Hey.

36:13.682 --> 36:15.471
You want to treat me

36:15.472 --> 36:18.431
like the faceless bad
guy without a conscience,

36:18.432 --> 36:21.511
ISIS, Bin Laden's bogeyman, go ahead.

36:21.512 --> 36:24.801
But I'm just a Muslim kid from Michigan

36:24.802 --> 36:27.891
who found out that the American dream

36:27.892 --> 36:30.342
was a lie for someone like me.

36:33.052 --> 36:34.511
America made us both.

36:34.512 --> 36:36.101
You know, actually,

36:36.102 --> 36:38.721
you could say we made each other.

36:38.722 --> 36:42.511
I never thought we'd have this
opportunity, but here we are.

36:42.512 --> 36:45.261
And you were right. It is about us.

36:45.262 --> 36:48.801
I don't want them to be a
part of it. I really don't.

36:48.802 --> 36:53.011
But sometimes, there's
collateral damage.

36:53.012 --> 36:55.102
Right, Rip?

36:58.753 --> 37:00.003
Make me believe it.

37:11.303 --> 37:13.302
When you call up your witness,

37:13.303 --> 37:16.172
you want to swear them
in first, like this.

37:16.173 --> 37:19.502
Do you swear to tell the
truth, the whole truth,

37:19.503 --> 37:21.212
and nothing but the truth?

37:21.213 --> 37:22.172
I do.

37:22.173 --> 37:24.002
Be seated.

37:24.003 --> 37:27.802
Would the attorneys like to
give their opening statements?

37:27.803 --> 37:30.542
Who's on trial?

37:32.253 --> 37:36.579
Counselors, we'll take
a five-minute recess.

37:36.582 --> 37:38.462
In the courtroom!

37:44.343 --> 37:45.633
Oh, hey, kids.

37:54.506 --> 37:56.680
I'm sorry about the other night.

37:59.003 --> 38:05.382
Joseph Graves, we will talk
about this when we get home.

38:05.383 --> 38:09.212
This is yours.

38:09.213 --> 38:10.923
Thank you.

38:15.423 --> 38:16.842
Good morning.

38:16.843 --> 38:19.044
- They're late for school.
- Way late.

38:19.047 --> 38:20.132
- Hey, Dad.
- Anabel!

38:20.133 --> 38:22.302
- Hey, I'll take 'em. I'll take 'em.
- Mom's taking us.

38:22.303 --> 38:24.342
Anabel, you have two seconds.
Say hello to your father.

38:24.343 --> 38:26.092
Hello to my father.

38:26.093 --> 38:27.302
Aww! Mwah!

38:27.303 --> 38:29.752
Okay, time's up. Let's go.

38:30.274 --> 38:31.273
Okay.

38:31.276 --> 38:32.325
Dad?

38:32.328 --> 38:33.342
Yes, darling.

38:33.343 --> 38:35.253
You smell really bad.

38:38.463 --> 38:40.003
I love you guys.

38:43.593 --> 38:45.042
Graves.

38:45.043 --> 38:46.842
Captain Pearson had a few questions

38:46.843 --> 38:49.172
about how things were handled.

38:49.173 --> 38:52.922
He recommended that you take
a few weeks off, but I said no.

38:52.923 --> 38:55.462
Thank you, sir.

38:55.463 --> 38:58.632
Can I trust you to keep it together?

38:58.633 --> 39:04.172
Look me in the eye and
tell me I can trust you.

39:04.173 --> 39:06.422
You can trust me.

39:06.423 --> 39:07.802
Good.

39:07.803 --> 39:09.842
Your team supports you, and so do I.

39:09.845 --> 39:11.135
Thank you, sir.

39:21.963 --> 39:24.803
Yo! Swell's coming in.
I got an extra board.

39:26.264 --> 39:27.474
Dharma?

39:30.093 --> 39:31.343
Dharma.

39:35.753 --> 39:37.673
Dharma, you can't sleep through the day.

39:53.742 --> 39:55.241
I'm sorry.

39:55.244 --> 39:57.874
Just... I can't be alone right now.

40:03.843 --> 40:04.963
Hold me.

40:06.471 --> 40:07.962
Tammi, I can't...

40:07.963 --> 40:09.172
Please.

40:17.753 --> 40:20.302
I can't believe this shit.

40:23.593 --> 40:26.002
Why don't we go
ahead and show the video.

40:26.003 --> 40:29.132
My name is Richard Taggart,

40:29.133 --> 40:31.842
and I'm the face of America.

40:31.843 --> 40:36.226
Everything that I'm about to
tell you comes from my heart.

40:37.803 --> 40:43.422
For 17 years, I was a
soldier on SEAL Team Six,

40:43.423 --> 40:47.712
the most elite special-operations
team in the world.

40:47.713 --> 40:53.752
On September 3rd, in
Kunar, Afghanistan, 2014,

40:53.753 --> 41:01.002
I murdered an unarmed American
who had surrender peacefully.

41:01.003 --> 41:04.342
I...

41:04.343 --> 41:06.252
I know now...

41:06.253 --> 41:10.132
Excuse me, this is very
hard for me to admit...

41:10.133 --> 41:15.842
that I was nothing more
than a hired assassin

41:15.843 --> 41:18.843
who committed war crimes.

41:21.633 --> 41:25.342
To the rest of the
world, rise up and fight

41:25.343 --> 41:29.252
America's endless war
against innocent Muslims.

41:29.253 --> 41:34.712
To America, take back your own soul,

41:34.713 --> 41:38.132
your dream of justice and freedom.

41:38.133 --> 41:43.252
To my brothers on SEAL Team Six...

41:43.253 --> 41:45.543
look inside your hearts.

41:48.633 --> 41:53.462
Let your better nature, let the truth...

41:53.463 --> 41:56.712
let it shine through.

41:56.713 --> 42:01.923
It's not too late. I am proof of that.
