WEBVTT

00:09.133 --> 00:11.333
- We're going to Cuba!
- Cuba!

00:11.333 --> 00:13.667
It's a three-day trip.
I'm super excited.

00:13.667 --> 00:16.100
I've always wanted the
opportunity to go to Cuba.

00:16.100 --> 00:21.067
Are you excited for Cuba?
Are you?

00:21.067 --> 00:23.533
Hola.
Everything is so cool, right?

00:23.533 --> 00:26.533
Lamar just asked for

00:26.533 --> 00:29.033
cash.
He was, like, waiting for me to

00:29.033 --> 00:30.967
leave town.
And he knows my phone doesn't

00:30.967 --> 00:34.233
work.
Being away from the hotel, and

00:34.233 --> 00:36.667
being unreachable, it's just
not, like, a settling feeling.

00:36.667 --> 00:42.333
I just don't think he would
still do the same thing.

00:50.400 --> 00:54.633
- A mia! A mia sia!
- Okay, guys,

00:54.633 --> 00:56.667
scoochie scoochie.
Scoochie scoochie.

00:56.667 --> 00:59.867
- Scoochie scoochie.
- Scoochie scoochie!

00:59.867 --> 01:03.633
Como estasa?

01:03.633 --> 01:06.433
Peace. Thanks a lot.
Thank you!

01:06.433 --> 01:10.167
- Viva la Cuba!
- Thank you.

01:10.167 --> 01:11.867
- Thank you.
- Gracias.

01:11.867 --> 01:16.500
Gracias. Thank you.
Cuba.

01:16.500 --> 01:20.733
Hit it.

01:34.500 --> 01:38.367
Have you ever honked

01:38.367 --> 01:43.100
your horn like that?

02:01.567 --> 02:04.367
Oh, those license plates
that say "Cuba" are so cool.

02:04.367 --> 02:09.967
- Really?
- Like that pink one.

02:09.967 --> 02:13.567
- Thank you.
- Should I get this for

02:13.567 --> 02:16.100
North?
Or would she like this bracelet

02:16.100 --> 02:17.733
- better?
- I like the

02:17.733 --> 02:20.033
necklace.
I feel like I need to get Mason

02:20.033 --> 02:21.967
- one more thing.
- What if you get him,

02:21.967 --> 02:24.133
- like, a wooden one of these?
- That is cool

02:24.133 --> 02:26.333
though.
He loves the cars here.

02:26.333 --> 02:28.733
Which car do you like?
This one, right?

02:28.733 --> 02:31.300
- Yeah, I like that color.
- Stupid.

02:31.300 --> 02:33.233
Kourt, have you heard
from Scott yet?

02:33.233 --> 02:35.467
- Yeah.
- Didn't he want to come

02:35.467 --> 02:37.367
- on this trip?
- Yeah, but he

02:37.367 --> 02:39.267
couldn't.
He decided too last-minute, so

02:39.267 --> 02:42.000
- the visa...
- Oh, that's right.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.067
- It's like his vibe though.
- I think he would

02:45.067 --> 02:47.900
like it, but he's more of, like,
a lay-in-the-sun kind of guy.

02:47.900 --> 02:49.433
- Yeah.
- Like, I feel like

02:49.433 --> 02:51.300
- the running around and the...
- This is free for you,

02:51.300 --> 02:52.400
- this bracelet.
- Oh, thank you.

02:52.400 --> 02:53.800
You're welcome, and
this is free for you, this

02:53.800 --> 02:54.900
- bracelet.
- Thank you.

02:54.900 --> 03:02.533
Muchas gracias.

03:02.533 --> 03:05.467
- Thank you, Armando.
- Oh, look at the

03:05.467 --> 03:07.533
- marketplace.
- Oh, how cute.

03:07.533 --> 03:11.833
- Probably the freshest fruit.
- True.

03:11.833 --> 03:14.467
- True? Yeah?
- It's true?

03:14.467 --> 03:16.600
Probably.

03:16.600 --> 03:18.100
You like the
peanuts?

03:18.100 --> 03:20.000
You like peanuts?

03:22.300 --> 03:25.067
- Do I like penis?
- Peanuts. Peanuts.

03:25.067 --> 03:27.800
- Peanuts.
- You like?

03:27.800 --> 03:31.233
Yes, I like peanuts.
Oh, how cute!

03:31.233 --> 03:33.433
Aw.

03:33.433 --> 03:36.100
Thank you.
I was like, Malika, don't you

03:36.100 --> 03:38.100
- dare.
- Khloe, I swear, I

03:38.100 --> 03:41.367
- heard it twice.
- I don't know why I'm,

03:41.367 --> 03:43.600
like, worried.
But Lamar was so good.

03:43.600 --> 03:45.633
- Like, he started...
- Khloe, I know that

03:45.633 --> 03:47.833
you're worried.
I've just tried not to bring it

03:47.833 --> 03:49.400
- up to you.
- No, but I asked him.

03:49.400 --> 03:51.333
I said, "Have you been having
any more dark thoughts?"

03:51.333 --> 03:54.467
He goes, "No, I'm great."
And that's what concerns me.

03:54.467 --> 03:57.733
I feel bad that I'm letting
the issues at home, you know,

03:57.733 --> 04:01.300
trickle into my Cuba trip.
But I finally get in touch with

04:01.300 --> 04:05.533
Lamar, and he sounds great,
but almost too good, where now

04:05.533 --> 04:07.333
I'm, like, paranoid and I'm
like, "Why do you sound

04:07.333 --> 04:09.767
so good?"
It just, like, freaks me out.

04:09.767 --> 04:11.633
I mean, he's given
you reason for concern.

04:11.633 --> 04:13.567
I-I... I know that 100%.
- Right, I just feel

04:13.567 --> 04:15.433
bad.
Like, I feel really bad even

04:15.433 --> 04:17.733
questioning it, but, um, I also
told him, I'm like, "It's gonna

04:17.733 --> 04:19.833
take you time to earn back your
trust."

04:19.833 --> 04:23.533
I don't know-- like, this
behavior is just different.

04:23.533 --> 04:26.567
I mean, it is.
Everything is out in the open

04:26.567 --> 04:29.800
now, so it's not--
there is no secret to what he

04:29.800 --> 04:35.000
- could potentially do again.
- So crazy.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.967
- Hey.
- We're not in Cuba.

04:36.967 --> 04:39.333
I'm bringing Cuba to us.
I got a serious case of FOMO for

04:39.333 --> 04:41.833
Cuba.
Let's do this!

04:41.833 --> 04:43.933
I do think Mom or

04:43.933 --> 04:46.767
Kylie, whoever, should've
presented it to Kanye first.

04:46.767 --> 04:48.767
100%.
Kylie's doing her second

04:48.767 --> 04:52.833
campaign with Puma, and Kanye
just felt blindsided.

04:52.833 --> 05:01.233
He didn't understand why he was
not at least in the loop.

05:01.233 --> 05:03.300
I feel really bad even
questioning it, but, um, I

05:03.300 --> 05:05.700
also told him, I'm like, "It's
gonna take you time to earn back

05:05.700 --> 05:07.667
your trust."
I don't know-- like, his

05:07.667 --> 05:12.167
- behavior is just different.
- I mean, it is.

05:12.167 --> 05:15.233
Everything is out in the open
now, so it's not-- there is no

05:15.233 --> 05:20.167
secret to what he could
potentially do again.

05:20.167 --> 05:24.233
So crazy.
I mean, even his drinking alone

05:24.233 --> 05:28.900
is so bothersome to me and it
makes me so furious, 'cause he

05:28.900 --> 05:32.467
can't be drinking.
It hasn't even been one year.

05:32.467 --> 05:36.533
But, honey, we know
not

05:36.533 --> 05:40.167
choosing that.
I think you've done a great job

05:40.167 --> 05:44.067
at being, like, supportive and
loving and helpful.

05:44.067 --> 05:47.633
I would just... would like to
see you be a little more

05:47.633 --> 05:52.433
- protective of yourself.
- Malika and I have been

05:52.433 --> 05:55.700
the best of friends for, like,
17 years, and we just know how

05:55.700 --> 05:58.367
to read each other.
She definitely knows when I'm in

05:58.367 --> 06:01.533
my moods, and she also knows how
to get me out of my moods.

06:01.533 --> 06:04.700
And especially when you're in a
foreign country for such a

06:04.700 --> 06:07.633
limited amount of time, you want
someone to get you out of that

06:07.633 --> 06:11.767
mood really  quick, so
you could enjoy where you are.

06:11.767 --> 06:14.233
- And Malika does that for me.
- I'll say a little

06:14.233 --> 06:26.433
prayer for you.
A big prayer for you, actually.

06:26.433 --> 06:28.500
- Hey, Scottie.
- Hey. Where are the

06:28.500 --> 06:29.867
- forks?
- Oh.

06:29.867 --> 06:32.200
- Oh, I found them.
- Or you can use just a

06:32.200 --> 06:34.367
plain silver one or a black and
silver one.

06:34.367 --> 06:35.867
- I like this one.
- You do?

06:35.867 --> 06:37.867
This an outfit or
pajamas?

06:37.867 --> 06:40.067
It's kind of in
between.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.800
- It's very chic.
- It's HermÃ¨s.

06:41.800 --> 06:43.600
That was pretty
obvious.

06:43.600 --> 06:45.600
I notice you're doing a little

06:45.600 --> 06:47.500
- remodeling.
- Yeah.

06:47.500 --> 06:49.367
Did you see what I did?
I took all the...

06:49.367 --> 06:52.467
That's, like, half
mid-century modern in there now.

06:52.467 --> 06:54.800
Yeah.
Where am I confused in here?

06:54.800 --> 06:57.333
- What are you trying to say?
- At what point are you

06:57.333 --> 06:59.267
- gonna change the floors now?
- Oh.

06:59.267 --> 07:01.367
'Cause the floors
don't match.

07:01.367 --> 07:04.133
The black and white
tile came before the Minotti

07:04.133 --> 07:06.800
- furniture.
- Like I said, it's

07:06.800 --> 07:08.800
- getting dated.
- Yeah, well.

07:08.800 --> 07:10.733
I mean, if you like
it, that's all that matters,

07:10.733 --> 07:13.700
but you just really, like,
pulled a Bruce Jenner out of

07:13.700 --> 07:15.533
that room.

07:15.533 --> 07:18.900
- Oh, yeah, I did.
And PS-- that TV

07:18.900 --> 07:21.800
- should probably be centered.
- Yeah, well, you know, I

07:21.800 --> 07:23.533
think you're worse than
Kourtney.

07:23.533 --> 07:26.400
Now I know why you guys are two
peas in a pod.

07:26.400 --> 07:28.533
By the way, we're not
together.

07:28.533 --> 07:31.400
I understand that, but
you act just like she does.

07:31.400 --> 07:33.767
Yeah, must've made a
great couple.

07:33.767 --> 07:35.533
- Is this centered now?
- Well, it's better.

07:35.533 --> 07:37.533
Who would do that to
somebody?

07:37.533 --> 07:39.033
I don't know.
I don't know.

07:39.033 --> 07:40.900
- It's just rude.
- It's like torture.

07:40.900 --> 07:42.867
- Ugh.
- I'm sure.

07:42.867 --> 07:45.533
Anyway.
I'm pretty bummed, by the way,

07:45.533 --> 07:47.800
that we're not in Cuba.
I feel like we're missing out on

07:47.800 --> 07:50.167
- something huge.
- Well, I think you've

07:50.167 --> 07:54.033
just got FOMO right now because
everyone went to someplace where

07:54.033 --> 07:56.567
- we've never been before.
- I tried to go, but

07:56.567 --> 07:59.500
there was so much I had to deal
with-- visas and customs-- and

07:59.500 --> 08:02.900
I was like, I don't need to get
arrested on the border of Cuba.

08:02.900 --> 08:05.633
- Yeah.
- But it looks so cool,

08:05.633 --> 08:07.267
and now I'm like, what am I
doing?

08:07.267 --> 08:09.233
Like, why am I in California and
everyone's in Cuba, you know

08:09.233 --> 08:10.500
- what I mean?
- Yeah.

08:10.500 --> 08:12.733
I heard that in Cuba,
there is literally no cell

08:12.733 --> 08:14.933
service.
But of course, the girls

08:14.933 --> 08:18.233
happened to figure out how to
get the Internet, and I have to

08:18.233 --> 08:21.133
say, now the girls are posting
all these photos with all these

08:21.133 --> 08:25.600
outfits on and Cuban cigars,
and I got a serious case of FOMO

08:25.600 --> 08:27.567
for Cuba.
I'm not happy.

08:27.567 --> 08:29.400
- I'm not happy at all.
- Well, look at it this

08:29.400 --> 08:31.667
way-- you just fixed my
television today.

08:31.667 --> 08:34.067
You know what?
I can rest well tonight.

08:34.067 --> 08:35.967
That's right.

08:48.567 --> 08:51.900
When we first got here,
we were living life, rolling

08:51.900 --> 08:54.167
around town.
No one knew who we were.

08:54.167 --> 08:57.200
But the word is spreading, so
now, like, people are showing up

08:57.200 --> 09:00.867
and paparazzi, and it's starting
to get a little bit hectic.

09:00.867 --> 09:03.867
We love you!

09:03.867 --> 09:06.033
Easy, Daddy.

09:06.033 --> 09:07.367
- Hi. Good morning.
- All right.

09:07.367 --> 09:10.367
- Hi. How are you?
- I want the front seat.

09:10.367 --> 09:21.067
- Just sit with KoKo.
- Mase, scoot over.

09:21.067 --> 09:22.967
I thought no one knew
who we were here.

09:22.967 --> 09:33.000
That's far from the
truth.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.833
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

09:34.833 --> 09:38.267
Today we are gonna go
salsa dancing with everybody.

09:38.267 --> 09:41.767
This is not something that I
typically do, but that's the

09:41.767 --> 09:44.967
point, is being somewhere new,
trying new things and just

09:44.967 --> 09:46.633
stepping outside your comfort
zone.

09:46.633 --> 09:50.367
- This is fun.
- Babe, this might be

09:50.367 --> 09:52.267
able to work as a skirt, like,
on the low.

09:52.267 --> 09:55.567
- I want my skirt, Mama.
- You want a skirt?

09:55.567 --> 09:57.333
- Yeah.
- We forgot to bring it.

09:57.333 --> 09:59.333
You have a purple skirt at the
house.

09:59.333 --> 10:02.400
That's so annoying.
You can't salsa dance without

10:02.400 --> 10:04.667
dresses, and we left ours at the
hotel.

10:04.667 --> 10:06.700
Thank God my husband has the
skills.

10:06.700 --> 10:10.233
I'm so glad that he figured this
out and made it happen.

10:10.233 --> 10:14.933
Oh, my God, Kanye is
making her an entire dress.

10:14.933 --> 10:20.533
This is the most genius thing I
have ever witnessed.

10:20.533 --> 10:22.600
- What's that?
- You.

10:22.600 --> 10:26.500
Designing your wife's skirt.
The cutest thing ever.

10:26.500 --> 10:29.667
- So cute.
- Yes, Kimmy!

10:29.667 --> 10:32.500
I love it.
Now, can you make your daughter

10:32.500 --> 10:34.067
- a skirt?
- Yeah.

10:34.067 --> 10:36.300
If North didn't have a
dress, she would feel so left

10:36.300 --> 10:38.967
out.
Everyone is happy and looks very

10:38.967 --> 10:41.200
- Cubano.
- So, do you know

10:41.200 --> 10:42.367
- how to dance salsa?
- No.

10:42.367 --> 10:43.800
- No.
- So, why don't you

10:43.800 --> 10:44.867
- try it?
- Yes.

10:44.867 --> 10:46.600
Let me show you
first how to do it.

10:46.600 --> 10:49.067
Actually, it's very simple.
And after that, so we can join

10:49.067 --> 10:50.900
- with the guys.
- Okay.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.500
The first step is
forward.

10:52.500 --> 10:55.233
One, so, two on the spot, and
three.

10:55.233 --> 10:59.467
We close, and now we go back.
We do our leg like five, six and

10:59.467 --> 11:01.933
seven.
This is the basic step.

11:01.933 --> 11:06.133
Okay? So let's try again.
One, two, three, and five, six,

11:06.133 --> 11:08.200
seven.
And now we change into the

11:08.200 --> 11:11.867
second one.
And one, two, three, and five,

11:11.867 --> 11:15.367
six, seven.
And one, two, three, and five,

11:15.367 --> 11:18.067
six, seven.
Okay, so now let's add one more

11:18.067 --> 11:19.900
- step.
- Even though I hate

11:19.900 --> 11:23.100
dancing, I'm gonna be a trouper.
Everyone else is excited, and I

11:23.100 --> 11:25.367
know North will be excited just
to see this.

11:25.367 --> 11:32.833
- âª âª- Oh, yeah, oh yeah.

11:32.833 --> 11:34.867
They're having so much fun.

11:42.067 --> 11:45.333
It's so good to see Khloe
letting loose, having so

11:45.333 --> 11:47.267
much fun.
This is just one of those

11:47.267 --> 11:50.533
moments where it just makes you
so happy.

11:50.533 --> 11:53.667
I just hope that Khloe is gonna
make the best of the trip and

11:53.667 --> 11:56.333
continue on and have a good
time.

12:01.333 --> 12:03.833
I'm gonna see if Khloe
won't help me with North on

12:03.833 --> 12:05.533
- Mother's Day.
- Where are you going to

12:05.533 --> 12:07.833
- be?
- New York.

12:07.833 --> 12:10.033
We didn't plan to be
together on Mother's Day?

12:10.033 --> 12:13.533
We discussed it.
I thought that we had really...

12:13.533 --> 12:15.467
But you discussed it
after the fact.

12:15.467 --> 12:18.567
Sometimes it's about a
business decision.

12:18.567 --> 12:20.800
Sometimes when you're
dealing with family, it's not

12:20.800 --> 12:31.700
really about a business
decision.

12:31.700 --> 12:33.367
- Kris?
- Hey.

12:33.367 --> 12:35.500
Hi.
So?

12:35.500 --> 12:37.767
- So?
- I have came up with a

12:37.767 --> 12:39.700
- master plan.
- A master plan for what?

12:39.700 --> 12:41.867
For feeling like I'm
missing out on Cuba.

12:41.867 --> 12:44.267
You still have Cuba
FOMO?

12:44.267 --> 12:46.967
Have you seen all the
pictures they're posting on

12:46.967 --> 12:49.100
Instagram?
Well, there's all the Cuban

12:49.100 --> 12:51.700
outfits and Cuban sandwiches and
Cuban chicken and Cuban cars

12:51.700 --> 12:54.500
and all these things, and it's
like, enough is enough!

12:54.500 --> 12:57.200
- So I'm bringing Cuba to me.
- I love it. I'm in.

12:57.200 --> 12:59.200
Yeah.
All we got to do is get, like,

12:59.200 --> 13:02.767
some chicken, vegetables, throw
some plantains in the air.

13:02.767 --> 13:05.933
We could put on some old,
little, like, pastel clothes

13:05.933 --> 13:08.600
that Kourt and Kim have been
wearing with the little tube

13:08.600 --> 13:10.167
tops...

13:10.167 --> 13:11.900
They sure do look good
though.

13:11.900 --> 13:13.600
They look amazing.
I'm pissed off.

13:13.600 --> 13:15.567
I'm not gonna wear a
tube top, but I hear you.

13:15.567 --> 13:17.267
What do I know?
I'm just a guy trying to get to

13:17.267 --> 13:19.700
Cuba.
If I can't go to Cuba, I'm

13:19.700 --> 13:22.100
bringing Cuba to me.
The embargo's over, baby.

13:22.100 --> 13:23.833
- Okay.
- I'm going Cuba, full

13:23.833 --> 13:25.200
- force.
- I want to be part of

13:25.200 --> 13:26.433
- the party.
- I appreciate you being

13:26.433 --> 13:27.633
- a part of the party.
- Okay.

13:27.633 --> 13:29.967
When Kourtney's been away with
the kids in the past, Scott

13:29.967 --> 13:33.500
has used this as almost an
excuse to do whatever he wants

13:33.500 --> 13:37.867
to do and hang out with his
friends, but I think it's really

13:37.867 --> 13:41.767
a testament to how Scott is
changing in such a great way,

13:41.767 --> 13:46.467
because he really wants to hang
out with me and Kylie while

13:46.467 --> 13:49.467
Kourtney's out of town with the
kids, and that's really

13:49.467 --> 13:50.633
impressive.
I'm in.

13:50.633 --> 13:51.667
- All right.
- Okay.

13:51.667 --> 13:52.667
- Done.
- Done.

13:52.667 --> 13:54.000
I'm-I'm getting out
of here.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.300
- I'm going to work.
- Okay.

13:55.300 --> 14:02.267
All right, I'll see you
tomorrow in Cubaville.

14:02.267 --> 14:03.933
Look where we are
right now.

14:03.933 --> 14:06.233
This is absolutely perfect.
I'm gonna eat some rice and

14:06.233 --> 14:13.033
beans... 'cause they're my
favorite food.

14:13.033 --> 14:16.400
- I'm serious.
- Mama, what can I have?

14:16.400 --> 14:19.967
I ordered you guys
rice, chicken, same kind of

14:19.967 --> 14:22.500
stuff we're gonna eat the whole
time we're here.

14:22.500 --> 14:25.167
- Want some bread, Mase?
- Want to dip it?

14:25.167 --> 14:27.233
- Do you want to try it?
- The salsa dancing

14:27.233 --> 14:29.967
- was everything.
- Kourtney, we are the

14:29.967 --> 14:34.233
world's worst dancers ever.
I just hope you know.

14:34.233 --> 14:37.067
Everyone is like this, like,
so cazh.

14:37.067 --> 14:39.567
You and I are like...

14:39.567 --> 14:42.333
- It's like...
- That's so funny.

14:42.333 --> 14:47.333
Like, we cannot dance.
Kourtney, push play.

14:47.333 --> 14:50.200
You're gonna die.
Push play. Push play.

14:50.200 --> 14:52.300
- Oh, my God.
- Look at your arms.

14:52.300 --> 14:54.933
- You're so mom.
- That's not it at all.

14:54.933 --> 14:57.467
There you go.

14:57.467 --> 14:59.667
- So cute.
- Kim, watch it.

14:59.667 --> 15:01.200
- Wait.
- No, look at Khloe.

15:01.200 --> 15:03.367
- Khloe's, like, into it.
- I really tried to give

15:03.367 --> 15:05.100
- it my all.
- Look at Kim!

15:05.100 --> 15:07.600
I couldn't move with my

15:07.600 --> 15:10.833
- skirt.
- I was getting a little

15:10.833 --> 15:12.433
- too hip-hop rather than salsa.
- Yours is very

15:12.433 --> 15:14.167
hip-hop.
- We're so bad.

15:14.167 --> 15:16.367
- Good times, guys.
- Like, it was, like, our

15:16.367 --> 15:20.500
biggest fight that, like, I
don't dance at Kanye's concerts.

15:20.500 --> 15:22.200
- You know?
- You're like, "I don't

15:22.200 --> 15:23.767
dance period, babe.
I love your shows!"

15:23.767 --> 15:25.767
I did not dance on
Dancing with the Stars.

15:25.767 --> 15:28.067
Like, I did not dance.

15:28.067 --> 15:30.667
Look, it's not for
everybody.

15:30.667 --> 15:34.900
My biggest fear was,
that if

15:34.900 --> 15:37.800
I, like, sit next to BeyoncÃ©,
'cause she dances and she's up,

15:37.800 --> 15:40.133
like, you know.
So, in the last night of the

15:40.133 --> 15:42.800
tour, she came to the dressing
room, was like, "Hey, do you

15:42.800 --> 15:44.533
want to sit together?"
And I was like...

15:44.533 --> 15:47.333
And then she wanted to go in the

15:47.333 --> 15:50.767
mosh pit, and I was like, "Wait,
what do we do in the mosh pit?"

15:50.767 --> 15:53.900
She's like, "Dance!
Just let loose, just dance!"

15:53.900 --> 15:56.533
And I was like...
"My life is over."

15:56.533 --> 15:58.433
No.

16:05.533 --> 16:07.833
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey.

16:07.833 --> 16:11.100
We're not in Cuba.
I'm bringing Cuba to us!

16:11.100 --> 16:13.100
- Oh, my God.
- Are you ready?

16:13.100 --> 16:15.100
- Jordyn?
- Oh, my God.

16:15.100 --> 16:16.867
Were you supposed to
go to Cuba?

16:16.867 --> 16:18.367
- No.
- Well, you are now.

16:18.367 --> 16:20.633
- I'm down to try it.
- Thanks for being a

16:20.633 --> 16:22.533
good sport.
It's, like, rice and beans.

16:22.533 --> 16:24.900
I mean...
In order to get my Cuba on,

16:24.900 --> 16:27.567
there's definitely some levels
and steps I have to take.

16:27.567 --> 16:30.400
I want to ease everybody into
where I'm going with this thing.

16:30.400 --> 16:33.067
I don't want to just jump in
there, dancing around town with

16:33.067 --> 16:37.000
a cigar popping out of my mouth.
So today, just Cuban food.

16:37.000 --> 16:41.533
Holy... This has got a heavy,
uh, aroma to it.

16:41.533 --> 16:43.767
- An aroma.
- So, plantains.

16:43.767 --> 16:45.267
Those look good.
Those look good.

16:45.267 --> 16:46.733
- Okay.
- They look like buffalo

16:46.733 --> 16:47.733
wings.

16:47.733 --> 16:50.267
I didn't need to go to Cuba to
see a  buffalo wing.

16:50.267 --> 16:53.333
Holy Chicago, this is a lot of
rice.

16:53.333 --> 16:55.133
I knew I smelled
something.

16:55.133 --> 16:57.267
- Welcome to Cuba!
- Oh!

16:57.267 --> 16:59.867
Cuba?
This looks like my kitchen.

16:59.867 --> 17:01.767
Yeah, but it's Cubano
now.

17:01.767 --> 17:03.867
Oh, okay.
Do you want me to get you a

17:03.867 --> 17:05.333
- plate?
- I guess.

17:05.333 --> 17:06.967
- Yeah, all right.
- I mean, this looks

17:06.967 --> 17:09.400
good, this chicken and onions.
I didn't need to go to Cuba to

17:09.400 --> 17:11.267
see that.

17:11.267 --> 17:12.967
This is pretty cute
though.

17:12.967 --> 17:15.000
I mean, who else would go out of
their way to do this?

17:15.000 --> 17:17.433
Not many, not many.
Let's do it.

17:17.433 --> 17:18.967
- Okay.
- Okay, you just went

17:18.967 --> 17:20.300
- for it.
- You like it?

17:20.300 --> 17:22.300
- It's nice.
- This is really good.

17:22.300 --> 17:25.033
- Good job, Scott.
- I feel like we need

17:25.033 --> 17:27.667
some Cuban music.

17:27.667 --> 17:30.067
Oh, my God.

17:30.067 --> 17:33.033
Don't worry, fella!
I got a pocket speaker.

17:33.033 --> 17:34.800
Yeah.

17:34.800 --> 17:37.733
Let's get it, girls.

17:37.733 --> 17:42.500
Oh, yeah!

17:42.500 --> 17:45.433
- Who needs to travel?
- Turn it down a little

17:45.433 --> 17:47.267
bit.
Turn it down. Yeah.

17:47.267 --> 17:49.067
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Just a little bit.

17:49.067 --> 17:50.833
Where do you think you
are, America?

17:50.833 --> 17:52.700
- Just a little bit.
- You can't just go

17:52.700 --> 18:02.600
turning down the music in the
middle of a Cuban lunch.

18:02.600 --> 18:04.400
You look so hot right
now.

18:04.400 --> 18:06.500
- Thanks, babe.
- Especially here in,

18:06.500 --> 18:08.567
like, Cuba.
Like, appropriately hot for

18:08.567 --> 18:11.067
- Cuba.
- What would my life have

18:11.067 --> 18:13.833
been if I was with anybody else?
Like, all my friends, if I

18:13.833 --> 18:15.400
haven't seen them for a while,
they're like, "You guys are

18:15.400 --> 18:17.667
twins.
Like, could you ever imagine

18:17.667 --> 18:20.367
your life with anyone else?"
Like, "What else would you do?"

18:20.367 --> 18:24.800
And I was like, "I know."
I want to see if Khloe won't

18:24.800 --> 18:26.500
help me with North on Mother's
Day.

18:26.500 --> 18:28.267
Where are you going to
be?

18:28.267 --> 18:30.967
- New York.
- We didn't plan to be

18:30.967 --> 18:33.833
- together on Mother's Day?
- Well, I booked a photo

18:33.833 --> 18:36.433
shoot that lands on Mother's
Day, and now that I'm getting

18:36.433 --> 18:39.433
back into work, like,
everything's moving so fast, and

18:39.433 --> 18:41.900
it's just one of those
sacrifices I'm gonna have to

18:41.900 --> 18:45.000
- make.
- What are you gonna do

18:45.000 --> 18:46.800
- about Lamar?
- I need to just go home

18:46.800 --> 18:49.067
- and see.
- Hope for the best.

18:49.067 --> 18:53.167
- That's all you can do.
- Sometimes, it's about a

18:53.167 --> 18:55.167
- business decision.
- Well, sometimes when

18:55.167 --> 18:57.667
you're dealing with family, it's
not really about a business

18:57.667 --> 18:59.567
decision.

19:16.500 --> 19:19.133
If I had this back in
the days, man?

19:19.133 --> 19:22.333
Oh, forget about it.
Come on!

19:22.333 --> 19:25.433
- Where's the ladies?
- Where you at, man?

19:25.433 --> 19:28.467
I'm already jealous that I feel
like I'm missing out on this

19:28.467 --> 19:31.533
whole Cuban trip.
And so, today, I'm upping the

19:31.533 --> 19:33.400
ante a little bit.

19:33.400 --> 19:34.967
- Wow.
- Come on!

19:34.967 --> 19:37.000
- That is so cool!
- Ladies!

19:37.000 --> 19:38.433
- No!
- You think they're

19:38.433 --> 19:40.067
- gonna have Cubans?
- Is that Frenchie?

19:40.067 --> 19:42.033
You guys, this is
perfect!

19:42.033 --> 19:43.733
- How are you?
- This is amazing!

19:43.733 --> 19:45.267
- Want to hop in?
- We want to hop in!

19:45.267 --> 19:47.867
- No problem, girls.
- This is unbelievable.

19:47.867 --> 19:50.167
- Hop in.
- Scott and French are

19:50.167 --> 19:54.367
so crazy.
But I love this car, and I'm

19:54.367 --> 19:56.600
- down for the ride.
- Who needs Cuba?

19:56.600 --> 19:58.467
- We got Cuba!
- We got it right here!

19:58.467 --> 20:00.400
The A.C. don't work
in here, but it's okay.

20:00.400 --> 20:03.067
Now you guys know how
I felt 50 years ago.

20:03.067 --> 20:05.033
Come on, girls!

20:05.033 --> 20:06.800
Let's do this!

20:06.800 --> 20:09.767
- Ay, caramba!
- I love the music!

20:09.767 --> 20:11.767
I don't even know how
to, like, hold this in my mouth.

20:11.767 --> 20:14.400
- It's, like, so amazing.
- Want to light it?

20:14.400 --> 20:16.867
This is a nice little
ride.

20:16.867 --> 20:19.600
- Oh, whoa, Frenchie!
- Wait, wait, wait,

20:19.600 --> 20:22.367
- wait, wait, wait, wait!
- Oh.

20:22.367 --> 20:25.000
This is disgusting.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.167
This is so gross.

20:27.167 --> 20:29.233
This is the way to
live life, man.

20:29.233 --> 20:31.133
Cuba's feeling good.
We didn't even have to get on a

20:31.133 --> 20:32.600
- plane.
- Cuba's nice!

20:32.600 --> 20:34.300
I want to hit the
dance floor.

20:34.300 --> 20:36.633
By the time I'm done with the
carpet, it's gonna be smoking.

20:43.933 --> 20:46.067
This is what people did
in the '50s.

20:46.067 --> 20:49.400
They just drove around.
There wasn't a lot to do.

20:49.400 --> 20:51.333
That's a nice way
to live, man.

20:51.333 --> 20:53.767
Wait. I will say
though my Lip Kit launches in

20:53.767 --> 20:55.400
- 40 minutes.
- Oh, yeah.

20:55.400 --> 20:56.867
- Less than 40 minutes.
- Oh, , yeah.

20:56.867 --> 20:59.167
You're right.
I completely forgot.

20:59.167 --> 21:02.367
- That's all the time we have.
- You show me where...

21:02.367 --> 21:03.833
- And step on it.
- You show me where to

21:03.833 --> 21:05.233
- go, y'all.
- Okay, step on it.

21:05.233 --> 21:07.200
We don't have time to
around.

21:07.200 --> 21:10.400
The whole bringing
Cuba to L.A. vibe was going

21:10.400 --> 21:14.433
pretty, pretty well.
But, of course, Kris and Kylie

21:14.433 --> 21:18.700
started talking about Lip Kit
launches, so, in a nutshell, you

21:18.700 --> 21:20.800
can never slow anybody down, I
guess.

21:20.800 --> 21:22.467
Okay, we got to go
home.

21:22.467 --> 21:24.200
- Step on it.
- I'm really starting to

21:24.200 --> 21:31.067
think Cuba's not all it's
cracked up to be.

21:31.067 --> 21:34.633
It is our last night
in Cuba, and we have one last

21:34.633 --> 21:37.500
dinner planned at La Guarida
before we go back to L.A.

21:37.500 --> 21:40.133
tomorrow.
You guys, how gorgeous is this

21:40.133 --> 21:42.300
- place?
- So fabulous.

21:42.300 --> 21:44.033
Hi, guys.

21:44.033 --> 21:46.100
- Hey, what's up?
- Hello there.

21:46.100 --> 21:48.300
- Hi, Northie.
- Do you guys have

21:48.300 --> 21:50.033
- sangria?
- She loved those

21:50.033 --> 21:52.600
- bananas we had earlier.
- I think we'll have

21:52.600 --> 21:55.267
one, two, three, four, five
sangrias.

21:55.267 --> 21:56.500
- Sangrias?
- Right?

21:56.500 --> 21:59.300
'Cause everybody... Okay.
We were looking around when we

21:59.300 --> 22:02.500
were driving, at the end of the
day, how chill everyone is,

22:02.500 --> 22:04.400
- like, people.
- They're just, like,

22:04.400 --> 22:05.933
- lax.
- 'Cause they have no

22:05.933 --> 22:08.533
Internet or social media.
They're, like, sitting on the

22:08.533 --> 22:10.967
bus and they're just, like,
looking out the window, like,

22:10.967 --> 22:14.133
- really calm.
- Did you like the

22:14.133 --> 22:17.833
beans, Northie?
Did you like the rice?

22:17.833 --> 22:19.800
How do you feel about that
white dress you're wearing?

22:19.800 --> 22:22.567
I was just thinking
that even the first two

22:22.567 --> 22:27.433
questions were so, like, what I
would probably ask you.

22:27.433 --> 22:29.133
Do you like what
you're eating?

22:29.133 --> 22:31.633
What is Mom doing, by

22:31.633 --> 22:33.700
- the way?
- She's with Kylie.

22:33.700 --> 22:36.933
Didn't they ask you
about doing Adidas for her?

22:36.933 --> 22:38.267
They didn't ask me,
but...

22:38.267 --> 22:40.267
Kanye was doing his
Adidas deal.

22:40.267 --> 22:42.833
Mom called the people that Kanye
was doing his deal with and

22:42.833 --> 22:45.000
said, "Hey, we want to do a deal
for Kylie."

22:45.000 --> 22:47.833
But they only have a certain
budget a year, 'cause they were

22:47.833 --> 22:50.333
looking at him like a celebrity
deal.

22:50.333 --> 22:53.367
And so then she shot the
campaign for Puma.

22:53.367 --> 22:55.867
But did she tell Kanye
after that?

22:55.867 --> 23:00.167
No.
And then, once it was announced,

23:00.167 --> 23:03.033
- Kanye found out.
- This is what Puma is,

23:03.033 --> 23:05.133
y'all got to really realize.
It's like if I made a show on

23:05.133 --> 23:07.633
Sunday night and didn't tell
none of y'all about it.

23:07.633 --> 23:10.367
But I had did a couple shows
with y'all, just two shows with

23:10.367 --> 23:12.233
y'all first.
So people saw me and thought,

23:12.233 --> 23:14.533
"Aw, oh, he's cool on camera,
blah, blah."

23:14.533 --> 23:18.433
Somebody offered me a deal and
I, like, did it and didn't tell

23:18.433 --> 23:21.300
none of y'all, and brought all
of my, like, whatever cool

23:21.300 --> 23:22.733
friends.
Like, now it's like Jay Z,

23:22.733 --> 23:24.667
BeyoncÃ©, blah, blah, is all on
the show.

23:24.667 --> 23:27.033
I mean, I don't agree
with going against the family in

23:27.033 --> 23:29.500
that way.
I think Mom or Kylie, whoever,

23:29.500 --> 23:31.467
should've presented it to Kanye
first.

23:31.467 --> 23:35.133
100%.
Kanye had Kylie walk in his

23:35.133 --> 23:37.400
- first two Yeezy shows.
- All right,

23:37.400 --> 23:39.433
- models, line up.
- Gonna start soon. Dress!

23:39.433 --> 23:41.600
- Go with the line up.
- He really believed in

23:41.600 --> 23:45.700
her as a part of his brand.
And you know?

23:45.700 --> 23:50.467
I understand that my mom's job
as a manager is to get us deals,

23:50.467 --> 23:53.833
but sometimes I feel like
everything has to be really

23:53.833 --> 23:58.300
carefully played out.
And I feel like that was, like,

23:58.300 --> 24:00.867
- a conflict of interest.
- Our family, they're

24:00.867 --> 24:04.167
human beings first and, even
with family, people choose self,

24:04.167 --> 24:08.300
- they just do.
- Friends of mine call me

24:08.300 --> 24:12.067
and be like, "Ugh, was he so
pissed that Kylie did Puma?"

24:12.067 --> 24:15.700
I'm just annoyed with Mom at the
process.

24:15.700 --> 24:17.733
What are you gonna do
about Lamar?

24:17.733 --> 24:19.233
I don't know anything
yet.

24:19.233 --> 24:28.100
- I need to just go home and see.
- Yeah.

24:28.100 --> 24:31.233
Mom or Kylie, whoever,
should've presented it to Kanye

24:31.233 --> 24:35.767
- first.
- 100%.

24:35.767 --> 24:39.767
Our family, they're
human beings first and, even

24:39.767 --> 24:44.000
with family, people choose self,
they just do.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.900
P?

24:48.000 --> 24:52.367
Northie, did you know that your
mommy is our sister?

24:52.367 --> 24:56.000
You know Auntie Kourtney
and KoKo are my sisters?

24:56.000 --> 24:59.933
- Mm... yeah.
- Just like baby brother's

24:59.933 --> 25:02.033
- your brother?
- Yeah.

25:02.033 --> 25:03.600
So what's gonna happen
on Mother's Day?

25:03.600 --> 25:06.300
Are we going with you or you
just don't want to see, uh,

25:06.300 --> 25:08.667
your, uh, husband and children
on Mother's Day?

25:08.667 --> 25:12.900
So now they want me to
go to my fitting at 5:00 p.m.

25:12.900 --> 25:15.433
on Sunday, so that means I'm
gonna have to leave at, like,

25:15.433 --> 25:19.600
6:00 a.m.
I feel really bad, but I made

25:19.600 --> 25:22.100
this commitment, and I've
already had to reschedule this

25:22.100 --> 25:26.200
once, so I feel bad pulling out
because I'm just not that person

25:26.200 --> 25:28.800
when it comes to work.
Like, I always stay committed.

25:28.800 --> 25:30.633
Why don't you just
tell them you won't do your

25:30.633 --> 25:33.667
fitting until the morning of?
Say, "It's not an option.

25:33.667 --> 25:35.733
It's my Mother's Day, the first
one with my son."

25:35.733 --> 25:39.100
Just be dramatic.
Boss up.

25:39.100 --> 25:40.900
It's honest, and I
think anyone could really

25:40.900 --> 25:43.533
- respect that.
- What do you want me to

25:43.533 --> 25:46.200
do exactly on Mother's Day?

25:52.467 --> 25:56.533
So, Malika, are you

25:56.533 --> 25:57.533
- packed?
- Yeah.

25:57.533 --> 25:59.533
- Did you have fun?
- I had the best time.

25:59.533 --> 26:01.000
- Right?
- I called it on our

26:01.000 --> 26:02.200
- way in.
- Would you come back

26:02.200 --> 26:03.767
- here?
- Yeah, I would.

26:03.767 --> 26:06.267
- I love it.
- I would.

26:06.267 --> 26:08.733
I love it.
I lo-- I hope they just keep

26:08.733 --> 26:11.267
this 1950s vibe.
I mean, they could, like,

26:11.267 --> 26:13.033
modernize it a little bit if
they want.

26:13.033 --> 26:15.567
Maybe, like, just the
hotel that you stay in, but I

26:15.567 --> 26:18.800
- think, like, I love this look.
- It's so cool.

26:18.800 --> 26:20.933
I love that you have no-- you're
going to someone's house and

26:20.933 --> 26:22.833
it's a restaurant.
Like, it's so cool.

26:22.833 --> 26:24.600
Like, yesterday when we were
going to lunch, I was like,

26:24.600 --> 26:27.467
"Where are we going?"
And everyone is so nice here.

26:27.467 --> 26:29.533
And I love Armando.
Like, a lot.

26:29.533 --> 26:31.100
You really love
Armando.

26:31.100 --> 26:34.467
He's just so informed.
Like, if I were to take you

26:34.467 --> 26:38.533
around, like, California, I'd
literally be like, "Here's

26:38.533 --> 26:40.833
Robertson-- I can't tell you any
facts about there."

26:40.833 --> 26:44.600
Like, he knows everything going
back to, like, the 1700s.

26:44.600 --> 26:46.467
- Armando is the best.
- Khloe, you can't take

26:46.467 --> 26:48.100
- him home.
- He's, like, the nicest

26:48.100 --> 26:50.400
- man.
- Let's go so we can

26:50.400 --> 26:53.867
catch our flight.
Thank you for an amazing trip.

26:53.867 --> 26:56.167
Another amazing memory.

27:01.233 --> 27:03.333
- Good morning, Khloe.
- Good morning!

27:03.333 --> 27:05.600
Armando, did you know

27:05.600 --> 27:07.833
that you're Khloe's favorite
person in Cuba?

27:07.833 --> 27:09.867
- Me?
- Yup!

27:09.867 --> 27:11.700
- Oh, thank you.
- Yes! I love you.

27:11.700 --> 27:14.833
You're so great.
Another nice day.

27:14.833 --> 27:17.133
- Beautiful.
- Came, we saw, we

27:17.133 --> 27:19.567
- conquered.
- That we did.

27:19.567 --> 27:22.733
I absolutely loved this Cuba
trip.

27:22.733 --> 27:26.367
Not having a cell phone was,
like, super nice and enjoyable.

27:26.367 --> 27:29.000
And I wish we could stay longer,
but I got to get back to

27:29.000 --> 27:31.867
reality and figure out
everything that's been going on

27:31.867 --> 27:34.000
since I've been gone.
A lot could happen in three

27:34.000 --> 27:36.933
days.
Has a lot changed since, like,

27:36.933 --> 27:39.633
- Obama came here?
- Cuba changed five

27:39.633 --> 27:41.633
years ago when they had the
opportunity for the private

27:41.633 --> 27:43.633
- business.
- Do you like when

27:43.633 --> 27:45.633
people want to come here to
develop new things?

27:45.633 --> 27:47.633
- No.
- No?

27:47.633 --> 27:49.500
The Cuban people,
always the same.

27:49.500 --> 27:51.500
- Yeah.
- No change.

27:51.500 --> 27:53.733
I don't want it to
change.

27:53.733 --> 27:57.967
- It's perfect how it is.
- Say bye to Cuba.

27:57.967 --> 28:00.100
Bye, Cuba.

28:08.267 --> 28:10.100
- Are they good?
- Didn't it feel so

28:10.100 --> 28:13.667
good, guys, to be, like, not
connected with the world and

28:13.667 --> 28:16.700
- just not have our phones?
- I was telling...

28:16.700 --> 28:18.933
I was telling Malika earlier.
When we were leaving, I was

28:18.933 --> 28:21.433
like, the first day, like,
when we got off the plane, I was

28:21.433 --> 28:23.467
like, "Oh, my God!"
Like, there's no service.

28:23.467 --> 28:26.267
I was a little freaked out.
And that's why everyone's so

28:26.267 --> 28:28.267
calm and cool and, like,
relaxed.

28:28.267 --> 28:29.800
Yeah.
Don't you feel like it's

28:29.800 --> 28:31.633
something you guys should
do more often?

28:31.633 --> 28:34.067
Definitely.
Even just, like, communicating,

28:34.067 --> 28:36.167
like, with, "What time are we
leaving?" like, that was, like,

28:36.167 --> 28:38.067
a challenge.
Like, nobody was on their

28:38.067 --> 28:40.500
phones.
At dinner, everybody was

28:40.500 --> 28:42.500
- actually paying attention.
- We had really good

28:42.500 --> 28:44.500
- conversations at dinner.
- We did.

28:44.500 --> 28:46.500
Yeah.
Um, so, Cake?

28:46.500 --> 28:48.500
- Huh?
- Um, we're heading

28:48.500 --> 28:50.500
home.
What are you gonna do about

28:50.500 --> 28:52.333
- Lamar?
- I need to just go home

28:52.333 --> 28:54.167
and see.
Like, I don't know if Lamar's

28:54.167 --> 28:56.533
- done anything yet.
- Yeah.

28:56.533 --> 28:58.733
Hope for the best.
That's all you can do.

28:58.733 --> 29:02.267
- Yup.
- Does this plane

29:02.267 --> 29:04.167
have Wi-Fi?

29:10.233 --> 29:13.000
We're just doing a
little organizing, you know?

29:13.000 --> 29:15.267
- What the hell is this?
- Oh, my God.

29:15.267 --> 29:17.100
- Can I have that?
- Yeah.

29:17.100 --> 29:19.500
- Knock yourself out.
- Let me show...

29:19.500 --> 29:22.167
I'm gonna show you what it is.
Watch this.

29:22.167 --> 29:28.600
This is, like, a selfie stick
that stays somewhere though.

29:28.600 --> 29:31.867
- Ugh.
- Like, am I ever

29:31.867 --> 29:35.567
- gonna use a selfie stick?
- Yes, I need one.

29:35.567 --> 29:39.067
I'm dying for one.
God, this is a life changer.

29:39.067 --> 29:41.633
- What took me so long?
- It is?

29:41.633 --> 29:44.333
- Do I need it back?
- But how the hell do you

29:44.333 --> 29:46.233
take the photo?
Like, my arm can't reach.

29:46.233 --> 29:49.300
No. Here, look.
There's a remote.

29:49.300 --> 29:52.700
Stop.
So, I'll have literally people,

29:52.700 --> 29:56.467
like, friends of mine call me
and be like, "Ugh, was Kanye so

29:56.467 --> 29:59.233
pissed that Kylie did Puma?"
Like, people that don't even

29:59.233 --> 30:02.800
know how the deal went down or,
like, anything like that.

30:02.800 --> 30:05.967
- Yeah.
- People literally ask me.

30:05.967 --> 30:10.333
I just wish that my mom spoke
about it with us, because I feel

30:10.333 --> 30:13.933
like we're such a close family
that we should all be able to

30:13.933 --> 30:16.933
communicate so that we don't
step on each other's toes.

30:16.933 --> 30:18.933
I do see both
sides.

30:18.933 --> 30:21.233
I definitely see how
Kylie should've done that deal.

30:21.233 --> 30:23.233
You know what I mean?
I never want to get in the way

30:23.233 --> 30:25.333
- of anyone's money.
- Did he care that

30:25.333 --> 30:27.467
- she did a second shoot?
- No, not at all.

30:27.467 --> 30:29.700
He tweeted about it and was
being funny.

30:29.700 --> 30:33.033
I'm just annoyed with Mom at the
process.

30:33.033 --> 30:36.467
I mean, what's done is done, but
this is something that means a

30:36.467 --> 30:40.667
lot, so I want to explain to my
mom that, in the future,

30:40.667 --> 30:42.600
communicate and just be upfront.

30:44.533 --> 30:49.433
Yeah!

30:49.433 --> 30:51.433
Are you having trouble
breathing?

30:51.433 --> 30:53.467
- No.
- Okay.

30:53.467 --> 30:56.233
I've been so worried, but there
comes a time where you just

30:56.233 --> 30:58.500
realize, you know what,
there's nothing I can do.

30:58.500 --> 31:10.233
He has to take control of his
life.

31:10.233 --> 31:12.133
Bye.

31:16.667 --> 31:18.667
That's nice that
he came.

31:18.667 --> 31:20.767
- Yeah, so sweet.
- Did he just come

31:20.767 --> 31:23.133
- for today, like...
- He flew to New York just

31:23.133 --> 31:25.167
- to hang out.
- Just for Mother's

31:25.167 --> 31:27.167
- Day, right?
Mm-hmm.

31:27.167 --> 31:29.167
- That's nice.
Mm-hmm.

31:29.167 --> 31:31.833
Today is Mother's Day, and it's
the day of the shoot.

31:31.833 --> 31:34.900
I pushed my fitting into later
in the day so that I can just

31:34.900 --> 31:38.233
wake up with my kids and Kanye,
and have a normal Mother's Day

31:38.233 --> 31:41.000
before I flew out to New York,
because I understand how

31:41.000 --> 31:42.833
- important it is.
- Were you surprised

31:42.833 --> 31:44.700
- when you woke up?
- They just started

31:44.700 --> 31:46.533
playing, and I woke up.
Like, I was, like, startled.

31:46.533 --> 31:48.367
- Was it loud?
- Yeah, it was, like, so

31:48.367 --> 31:50.267
loud, and I was like...

31:50.267 --> 31:52.100
I thought he was playing music,
like, blasting it.

31:52.100 --> 31:53.933
I didn't know there was actually
an orchestra.

31:53.933 --> 31:56.300
And he's like, "Go get North."
Kanye was so sweet.

31:56.300 --> 32:01.033
I woke up to a full orchestra.
At least a dozen people playing

32:01.033 --> 32:11.200
the cello and violins.

32:11.200 --> 32:13.700
It was honestly, like, the
sweetest thing ever.

32:13.700 --> 32:15.700
That's so nice of
him.

32:15.700 --> 32:17.433
Of course, 'cause he's
like, "Babe, I have nothing to

32:17.433 --> 32:19.433
do for Mother's Day."
That's cute.

32:19.433 --> 32:21.667
Saint's first Mother's Day.
He always does the most

32:21.667 --> 32:23.833
- extravagant things.
- I know.

32:23.833 --> 32:25.800
Everyone on Twitter was like,
cra...

32:25.800 --> 32:27.233
- That's crazy.
Mm-hmm.

32:38.667 --> 32:42.500
Ooh, sangria!
Very Cuban of us.

32:42.500 --> 32:45.333
I had the best time with Kourt
and the babies.

32:45.333 --> 32:47.333
I feel like I haven't done a
vacation with her and the kids

32:47.333 --> 32:49.333
- ever.
- They're so good,

32:49.333 --> 32:51.200
- right?
- And they were the

32:51.200 --> 32:53.200
- highlight of my trip, seriously.
- Yeah, they're so good.

32:53.200 --> 32:55.200
You guys were fun,
but because of that, I text

32:55.200 --> 32:57.200
Scott.
I was like, "Honestly, you are

32:57.200 --> 32:59.200
so blessed.
You have the most amazing

32:59.200 --> 33:01.133
children."
And I was like, "I wish you

33:01.133 --> 33:03.133
could've been there, but I...
You know, I miss you.

33:03.133 --> 33:05.267
I just wanted you to know that."
And he's like, "I know.

33:05.267 --> 33:07.267
My kids are the best.
I really wanted to be with you

33:07.267 --> 33:09.367
guys.
I miss you, too."

33:09.367 --> 33:12.500
It was a short conversation, but
I just wanted him to know, like,

33:12.500 --> 33:15.933
"We thought of you.
Your children had a good time."

33:15.933 --> 33:17.933
He always has FOMO,
like, with us.

33:17.933 --> 33:20.100
And he thinks, like, we do
things out of sympathy, but in

33:20.100 --> 33:22.333
fact, we really want him there.
Like, we love Scott.

33:22.333 --> 33:24.200
He's a part of our lives.

33:24.200 --> 33:26.133
- Excusez-moi.
- Okay.

33:26.133 --> 33:27.800
- Hello?
- Hello.

33:27.800 --> 33:29.800
Hey. You know, we were
talking, and your phone cut out,

33:29.800 --> 33:31.733
- and you never called me back.
- Why does he breathe

33:31.733 --> 33:33.733
like a 600-pound fat man
sometimes?

33:33.733 --> 33:35.933
Yeah. Why do you
breathe like that, Lam?

33:35.933 --> 33:37.767
Are you... are you having
trouble breathing?

33:37.767 --> 33:39.100
I can hear him over
here.

33:39.100 --> 33:41.000
- No. Like what?
- So, why do you breathe

33:41.000 --> 33:43.100
like you're, like, a super-fat
person?

33:43.100 --> 33:44.933
- Like what?
- Like you're a

33:44.933 --> 33:46.500
super-fat person.
Like you have...

33:46.500 --> 33:48.767
Are you having trouble
breathing?

33:48.767 --> 33:50.767
- No.
- Okay.

33:50.767 --> 33:54.100
Is it from smoking too much?

33:54.100 --> 33:57.467
- No.
- Okay.

33:57.467 --> 33:59.933
Do you really just breathe like
that right now to  with

33:59.933 --> 34:02.300
- me?
- What?

34:02.300 --> 34:06.367
Ugh!

34:06.367 --> 34:08.333
- What happened?
- Nothing happened!

34:08.333 --> 34:11.100
Nothing happened!
Coming back from Cuba, I really

34:11.100 --> 34:13.367
want to keep Lamar in, like, a
positive space.

34:13.367 --> 34:15.633
I've been so worried this entire
time.

34:15.633 --> 34:18.733
It makes me feel good to know
that he is doing okay.

34:18.733 --> 34:21.633
But there comes a time where you
go through certain life

34:21.633 --> 34:23.633
experiences, and you just
realize, you know what,

34:23.633 --> 34:27.700
no matter what I do, there's
nothing I can do.

34:27.700 --> 34:30.933
He has to take control of his
life.

34:30.933 --> 34:32.933
It's been lovely,
Khlo.

34:32.933 --> 34:34.933
It's been even better
for me.

34:34.933 --> 34:38.900
Okay, I'll call you later.

34:38.900 --> 34:40.900
- Bye, baby.
- Bye.

34:40.900 --> 34:42.967
He's really cute when
he wants to be.

34:42.967 --> 34:52.000
Mm, it's all an act.
Don't fall for it.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
How's your house
coming?

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
- So good.
- Yeah?

34:56.000 --> 34:58.400
We discussed that
bathroom today.

34:58.400 --> 35:00.833
He does not want to do it,
'cause they said it'll take four

35:00.833 --> 35:02.933
- to six months more.
- It is so small.

35:02.933 --> 35:06.167
- It's wild.
- I know.

35:06.167 --> 35:09.833
There has been people that have
come up to me privately, like,

35:09.833 --> 35:12.533
not in front of Kanye, that is,
like, "Oh, my God.

35:12.533 --> 35:16.367
Was Kanye so pissed when your
mom did that deal for Kylie?

35:16.367 --> 35:18.367
Like, I would die if that were
me."

35:18.367 --> 35:20.533
It kind of goes with
the territory of wearing all

35:20.533 --> 35:23.233
these different hats and being
mom and manager.

35:23.233 --> 35:26.567
I run a business, and the
biggest part of my business is

35:26.567 --> 35:29.500
making sure that I really pay
attention to what works for

35:29.500 --> 35:31.833
everyone involved.
You know, it's like, what if I

35:31.833 --> 35:34.500
wasn't related to any of you?
I would be making business

35:34.500 --> 35:38.200
decisions based on deals that
come in and the best fit for

35:38.200 --> 35:42.233
each one of my "clients."
We discussed it.

35:42.233 --> 35:45.400
- I thought that we had really...
- But you discussed it

35:45.400 --> 35:47.967
- after the fact.
- Sometimes it's about

35:47.967 --> 35:51.233
a business decision, which is
completely not personal.

35:51.233 --> 35:53.633
Well, sometimes when
you're dealing with family, it's

35:53.633 --> 36:04.600
not really about a business
decision.

36:04.600 --> 36:07.900
Sometimes it's about a
business decision, which is

36:07.900 --> 36:09.900
- completely not personal.
- Well, sometimes, when

36:09.900 --> 36:12.167
you're dealing with family, it's
not really about a business

36:12.167 --> 36:16.067
decision.
She was the model that he wanted

36:16.067 --> 36:19.167
over anyone.
He saw Kylie and was like,

36:19.167 --> 36:22.000
"She has to be my Yeezy model."
I would've just liked the heads

36:22.000 --> 36:24.300
up.
Like, "Hey, we did try to call

36:24.300 --> 36:27.133
Adidas.
It didn't work out, but I want

36:27.133 --> 36:29.233
to go to other brands."
Mm-hmm.

36:29.233 --> 36:31.233
I never went to another brand.
They came to me.

36:31.233 --> 36:33.567
Or, "Hey, this deal came
in.

36:33.567 --> 36:35.900
I know you wanted to work
this out, and you really

36:35.900 --> 36:37.733
wanted Kylie.
If the funds aren't there, cool.

36:37.733 --> 36:39.567
We got to make this move."
Mm-hmm.

36:39.567 --> 36:41.233
Or, "This is the deal
she's getting here.

36:41.233 --> 36:42.900
Do you want to match it?
Do you want to do this?"

36:42.900 --> 36:44.600
Well, I did.
I told him that.

36:44.600 --> 36:46.533
He goes, "Well, you know, let me
talk to somebody..."

36:46.533 --> 36:49.967
You never said.
He had no idea until the shoot

36:49.967 --> 36:51.933
- was already happening.
- I'm just trying to give

36:51.933 --> 36:56.200
my best energy and do the best
job for everybody that I can.

36:56.200 --> 36:58.500
I was the one who initiated the
conversation in the very

36:58.500 --> 37:00.500
- beginning.
- But you didn't initiate

37:00.500 --> 37:02.500
it with him.
You tried to go and get an

37:02.500 --> 37:04.500
- Adidas deal.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

37:04.500 --> 37:06.267
Yes, and at the same
time, he was trying to negotiate

37:06.267 --> 37:08.100
- his Adidas deal...
- Yeah, but I didn't know

37:08.100 --> 37:09.767
- that.
- Let's say Kendall's with

37:09.767 --> 37:11.767
- EstÃ©e Lauder, right?
Mm-hmm.

37:11.767 --> 37:14.367
I have a new manager,
and my manager decides to call

37:14.367 --> 37:16.600
EstÃ©e Lauder to get me a deal.
And you're renegotiating with

37:16.600 --> 37:18.733
Kendall.
It could be a big thing, but it

37:18.733 --> 37:21.933
would take a little bit of a
dig if I were to sign a huge

37:21.933 --> 37:23.900
deal with EstÃ©e Lauder.
Don't you think it would be

37:23.900 --> 37:26.433
shady of me if I didn't call you
to be like, "Hey, I know you're

37:26.433 --> 37:29.400
with EstÃ©e Lauder, I know you've
already got that with Kendall,

37:29.400 --> 37:31.433
but my new team's taking me over
there"?

37:31.433 --> 37:33.400
You would be like, "Wait. That's
weird.

37:33.400 --> 37:37.367
Why is she gonna, like, step on
Kendall's turf?"

37:37.367 --> 37:40.967
Well...
Sometimes I get ahead of myself,

37:40.967 --> 37:44.267
too, and sometimes I forget to
communicate maybe the way that

37:44.267 --> 37:47.467
I should.
So, I feel bad, but it wasn't

37:47.467 --> 37:50.933
intentional, and I'm really
happy that things worked out the

37:50.933 --> 37:52.933
way they did.
It's perfect, because Kylie can

37:52.933 --> 37:54.933
do her thing.
She's so excited to be with the

37:54.933 --> 37:56.933
brand.
The brand's excited to be with

37:56.933 --> 37:58.933
her.
And it all worked out for the

37:58.933 --> 38:00.933
- best, you know?
- Yeah. Totally.

38:00.933 --> 38:04.600
I'm just really glad that my mom
understands where I'm coming

38:04.600 --> 38:07.700
from, and that, in the future,
if something like this happens

38:07.700 --> 38:10.200
again, she's just able to
communicate with me.

38:10.200 --> 38:12.467
I mean, we ultimately want
what's best for each other.

38:12.467 --> 38:14.567
Like, everybody
deserves to have a very

38:14.567 --> 38:17.133
successful life, if they're
willing to work hard,

38:17.133 --> 38:19.200
- and it's a good fit.
- Totally.

38:19.200 --> 38:21.933
And my job is to find
those opportunities, you know,

38:21.933 --> 38:25.467
- like, Kimberly Cupcakes.
- All the things we would

38:25.467 --> 38:27.467
do-- so wild.
- Yeah. Yeah.

38:27.467 --> 38:32.700
Well, you know, it's not like
you could sing or dance.

38:32.700 --> 38:36.167
We made the best of it, but it
got us to here.

38:46.933 --> 38:51.167
Hi!
Oh, P, you look so cute!

38:51.167 --> 38:54.467
- You look fantastic!
- Thank you!

38:54.467 --> 38:57.033
- You look gorgeous.
- Thank you.

38:57.033 --> 39:00.000
Look how cute this table looks.

39:00.000 --> 39:03.000
- Uh, and there's a band?
- Who made you a

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
- martini?
- My boyfriend.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
- Mwah.
- Hey, Scottie!

39:07.000 --> 39:09.533
Come on out.
I've been waiting for you!

39:09.533 --> 39:12.933
We did have such a
great time in Cuba, and I know

39:12.933 --> 39:16.833
that my mom and Scott really
felt left out, so Kourt and I

39:16.833 --> 39:21.067
throw a Cuban-themed party at my
house, and really get them to

39:21.067 --> 39:23.733
feel that Cuban vibe, like, to
a T.

39:23.733 --> 39:25.933
I want them to really think
they're in Cuba.

39:25.933 --> 39:28.300
In Cuba, our phones
did not work.

39:28.300 --> 39:30.000
And it was the most amazing
experience.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.633
I'm a doctor right
now.

39:31.633 --> 39:33.467
- I understand that.
- I'm a doctor.

39:33.467 --> 39:35.133
I would love for you
to give me your phone for 30

39:35.133 --> 39:36.967
- minutes.
- Okay, take it.

39:36.967 --> 39:38.800
- I love you for this.
- You do? It's fine.

39:38.800 --> 39:40.467
I thought if you
gave up a fight, like, I could,

39:40.467 --> 39:42.300
- too.
- You're gonna have the

39:42.300 --> 39:43.967
- best Cuban experience.
- Scott, I need your

39:43.967 --> 39:45.800
cell phone.
Food is just being brought out,

39:45.800 --> 39:47.633
if you guys want to sit at the
table.

39:47.633 --> 39:49.133
- Let's do it!
- Yeah.

39:49.133 --> 39:51.133
- I'm sitting here!
- So, literally, this

39:51.133 --> 39:55.967
is what we ate every single day.
Rice, beans, plantains and

39:55.967 --> 39:59.033
- chicken.
- Ooh, yeah, P.

39:59.033 --> 40:02.900
- Bring the vibes.
- Look at how beautiful

40:02.900 --> 40:05.467
this looks.

40:05.467 --> 40:09.600
Oh, my God!

40:09.600 --> 40:11.433
That's a really
cool dress.

40:11.433 --> 40:13.767
- Thanks.
- So, you know what?

40:13.767 --> 40:16.067
We just wanted to bring you guys
together.

40:16.067 --> 40:19.367
To the people who were not able
to come to Cuba, we wanted to

40:19.367 --> 40:23.100
- bring Cuba to you guys.
- And we appreciate it.

40:23.100 --> 40:24.433
- So, here we are.
- Thank you.

40:24.433 --> 40:26.600
- No cell phones...
- This is not Cuba!

40:26.600 --> 40:29.567
- Mason!
- This is just pretend.

40:29.567 --> 40:31.800
KoKo planned it as a certain
kind of thing.

40:31.800 --> 40:33.667
- Because I wanted...
- This is all fake?

40:33.667 --> 40:36.500
I want-- Masey, you
know how we got to go to Cuba?

40:36.500 --> 40:39.567
I wanted Lovey and everyone to
pretend that they were in Cuba,

40:39.567 --> 40:42.500
'cause they couldn't go.
Mase, what was your favorite

40:42.500 --> 40:45.100
- part about Cuba?
- Having dinner with

40:45.100 --> 40:46.467
- everyone!
- Aw!

40:46.467 --> 40:48.500
- Aw, that's nice.
- That's nice, Mase.

40:48.500 --> 40:50.533
See? That's why we're trying to
have dinner here.

40:50.533 --> 40:52.533
Remember the cars that we drove
in?

40:52.533 --> 40:54.467
Those were awesome.
Did you like the pink one or

40:54.467 --> 40:56.367
- the red one?
- Green and red.

40:56.367 --> 40:57.833
Did you like salsa
dancing?

40:57.833 --> 40:59.467
Uh-huh.
- Legit?

40:59.467 --> 41:02.533
Da-da-da!
- Yeah!

41:02.533 --> 41:04.900
- Go, Mase, go!
- Right?

41:04.900 --> 41:07.133
You know, it meant a lot that
Khloe went out of her way and

41:07.133 --> 41:09.767
really made, like, an amazing
authentic Cuban night at her

41:09.767 --> 41:12.367
house for me.
The best part of the night is

41:12.367 --> 41:16.167
Mason telling me all the stories
about the cars in Cuba, and just

41:16.167 --> 41:18.600
watching Kris have fun.
And not everyone was sitting on

41:18.600 --> 41:21.433
their phones, texting away,
e-mailing, and not really being

41:21.433 --> 41:23.433
present.
You know, maybe I didn't get to

41:23.433 --> 41:27.233
go to Cuba, but at least I'm
getting to spend some really

41:27.233 --> 41:30.733
- nice time with them now.
- Yes!

41:30.733 --> 41:32.933
- Oh!
- Oh!

41:32.933 --> 41:34.667
Here we go! Here we go!
Dancing with the

41:34.667 --> 41:37.033
- Stars.
- Oh, that is kind of

41:37.033 --> 41:39.100
amazing.
Kim, let's turn it up.

41:39.100 --> 41:42.067
- Get out there.
- I actually threw my back

41:42.067 --> 41:44.867
- out, so I can't really move.
- You sound like your

41:44.867 --> 41:48.033
mother.

41:48.033 --> 41:51.333
Should we be dancing
with these girls?

42:00.600 --> 42:04.433
Khloe!
Conga line!

42:04.433 --> 42:06.333
Whatever.

42:24.467 --> 42:26.833
- That was fun, you guys.
- Smile for the camera,

42:26.833 --> 42:28.300
- P!
- Cheese!

42:28.300 --> 42:32.300
- Oh.
- Oh, P, you're so cute,

42:32.300 --> 42:35.400
P.
Maybe our Cuba trip will remind

42:35.400 --> 42:38.667
all of us to take advantage of
family time when we have it.

42:38.667 --> 42:40.867
Trip was legit!

42:40.867 --> 42:43.000
- Yeah!
- That was so fun.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.900
Oye! Oye!
Arriba, arriba!

42:45.900 --> 42:48.067
- mean?
- I have no idea.

42:48.067 --> 42:49.733
I think that's just

42:49.733 --> 42:52.700
like, "Hey, hey."
Oye.

42:52.700 --> 42:55.367
- Oh. Okay.
- Your mom is really

42:55.367 --> 42:57.000
enjoying Cuba.
Oye.

43:03.267 --> 43:06.500
Okrrr,
okrrr, okrrr, okrrr, okrrr,

43:06.500 --> 43:09.767
- okrrr, okrrr.
- Okrrr, okrrr, okrrr,

43:09.767 --> 43:12.000
obrrr, oh, bu...
Okay, I got to go now.

43:12.000 --> 43:13.833
- Love you, guys.
- Love you.

43:13.833 --> 43:17.833
Okrrr!

43:17.833 --> 43:20.300
- On the next episode...
- You can eat this.

43:20.300 --> 43:21.633
- No.
- She thinks she's

43:21.633 --> 43:25.067
allergic to everything.
I want to replace everything

43:25.067 --> 43:28.633
with regular gluten, and then
we'll see the end result.

43:28.633 --> 43:30.200
Did you see the
emojis?

43:30.200 --> 43:31.667
That's Kylie.
Look at her.

43:31.667 --> 43:33.500
You're not pissed
they kind of made an emoji

43:33.500 --> 43:35.933
of you?
Do you still take your

43:35.933 --> 43:38.700
medicine every morning?
Lamar hasn't followed through

43:38.700 --> 43:41.600
- recently with so many things.
- He obviously doesn't

43:41.600 --> 43:43.367
- care.
- No.

43:43.367 --> 43:47.500
