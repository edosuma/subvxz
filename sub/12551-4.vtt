12:11.931 --> 12:13.866
it's not dangerous, is it?

12:13.933 --> 12:16.168
On the contrary,
I hope it can help
end something that is.

12:16.235 --> 12:17.636
Oh, thank you.

12:21.006 --> 12:24.043
We think it came
from deep, deep space.

12:24.110 --> 12:26.712
But the samples
we've seen from Mars

12:26.779 --> 12:29.982
offer far more evidence
of extra-terrestrial life.

But you won't
take much, will you?

12:33.552 --> 12:35.020

this is highly irregular.

never allow it but...

the difference.

What's wrong, Mr Spellman?
Not game for a laugh?

23:51.463 --> 23:54.833
People have shuddered
with fear in my shadow
for over 700 years.

23:54.900 --> 23:56.301
And now they're
rocking with laughter.

23:56.368 --> 23:57.803
I bet that's a real
kick in the ego.

23:57.869 --> 23:59.371
Sarah Jane! Your pocket!

23:59.437 --> 24:01.239
I went to the dentist,
he said, "Say, 'Ahhh!'"

24:01.306 --> 24:03.241
I said, "Why?"
He said, "My dog's dead."

24:03.308 --> 24:04.943
Of course. That's it!

24:05.010 --> 24:07.646
You think you can destroy me
with pathetic jokes?

24:07.712 --> 24:09.281
Hey, this is classic material.

24:09.347 --> 24:11.082
I'm not going to
destroy you, Mr Spellman.

24:11.149 --> 24:12.984
I'm just going
to put you back
where you belong,

24:13.051 --> 24:15.086
where you don't need
anyone's fear to survive.

24:15.987 --> 24:17.389
(LAUGHTER ECHOING)

24:17.823 --> 24:19.191
No!

24:19.257 --> 24:21.126
This is where you belong,

24:21.193 --> 24:22.961
the meteor that
brought you to Earth.

24:23.028 --> 24:24.462
You've always
been attached to it,

24:24.529 --> 24:26.031
but you were
strong enough
to resist its pull.

24:26.097 --> 24:27.499
But not any more, Mr Spellman.

24:27.566 --> 24:28.867
The nightmare is over!

24:39.110 --> 24:40.912
Thank you!
The joker in the pack.

24:42.380 --> 24:44.449
Every alien-busting team
should have one.

24:44.516 --> 24:46.551
That was
good thinking, Clyde.

24:46.618 --> 24:48.286
Well,
it was Rani's idea.

24:48.353 --> 24:50.021
Yeah,
but I told him
to be funny.

24:50.856 --> 24:52.524
-Mum!
-Oh, Luke!

24:52.591 --> 24:54.860
Luke!
Luke, you're all right!

24:56.194 --> 24:59.664
What happened?
Where's Spellman?

24:59.731 --> 25:03.635
I imagine you could say
he's finally paid the piper.

25:03.702 --> 25:04.870
(CHUCKLING)

25:10.609 --> 25:12.277
MR SMITH: <i>The children</i>
<i>taken in recent weeks</i>

25:12.344 --> 25:14.479
<i>have all been found</i>
<i>safe and well.</i>

25:14.546 --> 25:16.481
<i>They have no memory</i>
<i>of what happened to them,</i>

25:16.548 --> 25:18.516
<i>but were clearly released</i>
<i>when the energy entity</i>

25:18.583 --> 25:20.785
<i>was returned to</i>
<i>the meteor fragment.</i>

25:20.852 --> 25:24.756
And that is going in here.

25:28.493 --> 25:30.595
Halkonite steel.

25:31.863 --> 25:34.900
Nothing can get through it.
Not even thoughts.

25:37.669 --> 25:41.840
So what happens now?
Do you trust me to
keep all this secret?

25:41.907 --> 25:43.742
When it comes to
getting a true glimpse
of the universe,

25:43.808 --> 25:45.677
there are two types of people.

25:45.744 --> 25:47.679
Those who refuse to believe,

25:47.746 --> 25:51.349
that will tell themselves
anything to deny
the evidence of their eyes,

25:51.416 --> 25:56.554
and those that
embrace the universe,
and just how special life is,

25:56.621 --> 26:00.425
and want it to stay that way
by keeping it safe and secret.

26:00.492 --> 26:02.193
And that's me?

26:02.260 --> 26:04.596
That's all of us.

26:04.663 --> 26:06.798
Rani, where do you
think you've been?

26:06.865 --> 26:08.099
I thought you would
have had more sense

26:08.166 --> 26:09.834
than to get involved
in this walkout.

26:09.901 --> 26:11.770
-Walkout?
-Stupid prank.

26:11.836 --> 26:13.071
The whole school
went walkabout,

26:13.138 --> 26:14.506
then wanders back
a couple of hours later,

26:14.572 --> 26:16.675
claiming not to have known
what they'd been doing.

26:16.741 --> 26:18.410
Obviously, some
bright spark thought

26:18.476 --> 26:20.912
it'd be a good way
of winding up
the new headteacher.

26:20.979 --> 26:24.049
Yeah. Of course.
'Cause I'm the joker
in the pack, aren't I?

26:24.115 --> 26:26.084
We had free periods
this afternoon.

26:26.151 --> 26:28.753
We've been at
the library in town
researching for a project.

26:28.820 --> 26:30.522
-Clyde, Luke and me.
-See?

26:30.588 --> 26:32.324
That's why she wasn't
answering her phone.

26:32.390 --> 26:35.226
I was at the library myself
and brought them home.

26:35.293 --> 26:37.462
I thought I'd take
your advice, sir.

26:37.529 --> 26:41.032
Try applying my brains
to something other
than being funny.

26:41.099 --> 26:43.935
Oh, by the way,
I saw it on the news.

26:44.135 --> 26:48.006
All those kids turned up
like nothing ever happened,

26:48.073 --> 26:51.643
very happy-ever-after,
but I can't help thinking,
weird.

26:51.710 --> 26:54.379
Not weird, Mum. Surprising.

26:54.446 --> 26:57.682
The universe is
a surprising place.

26:57.749 --> 27:00.819
Anyway,
Haresh is making
veggie chilli for tea.

27:00.885 --> 27:03.922
You're all welcome to share.

27:03.989 --> 27:07.759
I'd love to,
but I need to get on
with some work. But Luke...

27:07.826 --> 27:10.428
-Yeah, please.
-Come on.

27:10.495 --> 27:12.664
Haresh is always cooking
far too much food.

27:12.731 --> 27:14.766
He's got this thing
about Dawn French.

27:14.833 --> 27:16.935
His mother always said
I was far too skinny.

27:22.507 --> 27:24.876
Look at me,
with my new headteacher
cooking me tea!

27:26.478 --> 27:28.847
The universe really is
a surprising place.

27:33.585 --> 27:34.853
Yes.

27:36.154 --> 27:37.856
It really is.

27:51.036 --> 27:54.039
There's no power in the stars.

27:54.105 --> 27:55.507
SARAH JANE: <i>This Trueman's</i>
<i>come from nowhere,</i>

27:55.573 --> 27:56.941
<i>now he's pulling in</i>
<i>all these people.</i>

27:57.008 --> 27:58.109
What if there's
another universe?

27:58.176 --> 27:59.411
Where astrology worked.

27:59.477 --> 28:02.514
I've got things to do,
such amazing things.

28:04.215 --> 28:06.785
The Ancient Lights
will destroy you!
