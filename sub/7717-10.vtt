WEBVTT

00:01.334 --> 00:03.402
- To me, the sixers
are a five-seed, tops.

00:03.404 --> 00:06.038
- I think they're going
to the conference finals.

00:06.040 --> 00:08.240
- No.
- Bynum, an obvious monster.

00:08.242 --> 00:10.642
At three-point shooting,
don't even--

00:10.644 --> 00:14.480
I bit my lip
at lunch today.

00:14.482 --> 00:17.483
- Sucks.
Anyway, I just don't see it.

00:17.485 --> 00:22.021
The nets are tough.
- Oh, the nets are super tough.

00:22.023 --> 00:26.091
- Now I have this big bump
on my lip that hurts.

00:26.093 --> 00:28.327
I hate it.

00:28.329 --> 00:31.597
- The hawks are terrible.
They're always terrible.

00:31.599 --> 00:33.565
- Okay, you need
to think about it

00:33.567 --> 00:37.169
Before you come with the--

00:38.238 --> 00:40.706
Whatever.
It's not a big deal.

00:40.708 --> 00:42.274
You know, I always tell
my three-year-old,

00:42.276 --> 00:43.809
If this is the worst thing
that's gonna happen--

00:43.811 --> 00:45.677
You gotta be kidding me!

00:45.679 --> 00:51.483
Okay. Pam, that's it.
I'm going home.

00:51.485 --> 00:54.253
[cheerful music]

00:54.255 --> 00:59.458
â™ª

01:02.262 --> 01:05.064
- Morning, meredith.

01:05.066 --> 01:06.131
- What?

01:06.133 --> 01:08.233
- Oh, sorry. Pam.

01:08.235 --> 01:09.802
Yikes.

01:09.804 --> 01:13.505
- Jim's been spending
a few days a week in philly,

01:13.507 --> 01:16.842
And I'm not gonna lie--
it's been challenging.

01:19.412 --> 01:21.447
Yesterday, things took
a turn for the worse.

01:21.449 --> 01:25.250
I found out cece has lice,
so I was up all night,

01:25.252 --> 01:29.288
Disinfecting every sheet,
towel, toy,

01:29.290 --> 01:31.657
Item of clothing
in the entire house.

01:31.659 --> 01:35.627
I'm exhausted.
But don't tell jim.

01:35.629 --> 01:40.132
He has a huge meeting today,
under a lot of pressure,

01:40.134 --> 01:43.602
And he's doing it all
for the family.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.838
- I am meeting
dr. J today,

01:45.840 --> 01:47.473
Otherwise known
as julius erving,

01:47.475 --> 01:50.676
Famed 76er
and my own personal hero.

01:50.678 --> 01:52.778
But I have to be careful
not to rub it in pam's face

01:52.780 --> 01:55.848
Because, let's be honest,
how would I feel

01:55.850 --> 01:57.516
If I was at home,
stuck with the kids

01:57.518 --> 02:01.753
While she was go-karting
with john stamos?

02:01.755 --> 02:03.822
You sound tired.
Everything okay?

02:03.824 --> 02:05.791
- Great.
Everything's great.

02:05.793 --> 02:08.127
Hey, are you nervous
about your big meeting?

02:08.129 --> 02:09.495
- Uh, a little bit.

02:09.497 --> 02:11.363
It's a lot of pressure,
you know?

02:11.365 --> 02:13.265
But that's what
I signed up for, right?

02:13.267 --> 02:16.702
- Jim, the limo's here.
- Uh, you know what?

02:16.704 --> 02:18.537
I gotta hop off
because my, uh,

02:18.539 --> 02:21.373
Taxi is here to take me
to the meeting.

02:21.375 --> 02:22.674
- Oh, call me later.
- Okay.

02:22.676 --> 02:25.844
- I love you.
- Love you too. Bye.

02:25.846 --> 02:27.513
[mouths words]

02:27.515 --> 02:28.814
- How are you doing?

02:28.816 --> 02:31.216
- Okay. I mean,
it's what you want, so--

02:31.218 --> 02:34.586
- It's how it has to be.
- I know, I know.

02:34.588 --> 02:36.588
It's just hard.

02:36.590 --> 02:38.190
Me and val
were going nowhere,

02:38.192 --> 02:40.325
And if I'm gonna be
working in philly,

02:40.327 --> 02:41.460
I'm gonna need my freedom,

02:41.462 --> 02:43.829
So I convinced val
to break up with me.

02:43.831 --> 02:45.430
Here's how you do it.

02:45.432 --> 02:47.699
You say, "what are you gonna do,
break up with me?"

02:47.701 --> 02:49.201
Like, as a joke.

02:49.203 --> 02:51.336
And then you gain
a lot of weight.

02:51.338 --> 02:53.639
I'll never be sorry,
not for a moment of it.

02:53.641 --> 02:56.408
- Me neither.
Come here.

02:58.845 --> 03:01.547
- Hey, meredith, I need
your supply requests today.

03:01.549 --> 03:02.748
- Jeez h. In the morning,

03:02.750 --> 03:04.449
Will you stop your nagging
already?

03:04.451 --> 03:10.322
- He didn't leave me.
He just went part-time.

03:12.292 --> 03:13.458
Can you just fill out
the form, please?

03:13.460 --> 03:16.828
- Yes.
[scratching]

03:16.830 --> 03:18.964
- I'm sure
she's just confused.

03:18.966 --> 03:22.801
People scratch their heads
when they're confused.

03:22.803 --> 03:25.270
Not always like an ape,
the way meredith just did,

03:25.272 --> 03:27.306
But it happens.

03:27.308 --> 03:29.808
- Trust me,
I know what I'm doing.

03:29.810 --> 03:31.610
Between the foster homes
and the orphanage,

03:31.612 --> 03:34.279
I had lice 22 times.

03:34.281 --> 03:36.281
[gasps]
holy wow, that's a big one.

03:36.283 --> 03:38.417
All right, pencils down,
everyone--we've got lice.

03:38.419 --> 03:39.751
- [groans]

03:39.753 --> 03:41.520
- Oh, god, meredith!
Lice?

03:41.522 --> 03:43.722
Did you not sign
a pledge to shower?

03:43.724 --> 03:47.859
- What? Lice?
Oh, my god.

03:47.861 --> 03:50.996
Lock the doors.
We're on full quarantine.

03:50.998 --> 03:52.898
- Dwight, relax.
It's just lice.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.333
Maybe, possibly.

03:54.335 --> 03:57.002
- Just lice, pam?

03:57.004 --> 03:59.638
Of all of the vermin
in god's great green kingdom,

03:59.640 --> 04:01.974
Lice are the ones
I detest the most.

04:01.976 --> 04:04.343
My first day of school,
I had lice,

04:04.345 --> 04:05.978
And no one would play
with me.

04:05.980 --> 04:08.981
For 15 years,
they called me "freak"

04:08.983 --> 04:11.883
And "four eyes" and "sci-fi
nerd" and "girl puncher,"

04:11.885 --> 04:15.020
All because I had lice
when I was seven.

04:15.022 --> 04:16.021
Make way.
- Dwight!

04:16.023 --> 04:19.024
- No.
Inspect me.

04:19.026 --> 04:22.294
- Oh, this is the cleanest scalp
I've ever seen.

04:22.296 --> 04:23.562
You are all clear.
- I should be.

04:23.564 --> 04:25.397
I use lice shampoo
every morning.

04:25.399 --> 04:26.398
[sprays]

04:26.400 --> 04:27.399
- Hey!
- Oh!

04:27.401 --> 04:29.268
- Stop that!
- Dwight!

04:29.270 --> 04:31.270
- [coughs]
- next.

04:31.272 --> 04:33.338
- Jeez, meredith, you know,
this is an office.

04:33.340 --> 04:35.340
It's not one
of your bean-bag orgies.

04:35.342 --> 04:37.009
- Uh, let's give her
a break.

04:37.011 --> 04:39.578
We don't know for sure
this is meredith's fault.

04:39.580 --> 04:42.414
- Pam, really?
Come on.

04:42.416 --> 04:44.650
- Hey, what do you want?
I know who I am.

04:44.652 --> 04:47.619
Nobody's taking meredith palmer
to the opera to meet the queen.

04:47.621 --> 04:48.620
- Lice.
- [gasps]

04:48.622 --> 04:52.824
- Angela has lice.
- Ew! Oh! [groans]

04:52.826 --> 04:56.328
- Ooh, yabber. Lice.
Yikers. Lice.

04:56.330 --> 05:00.565
- No. How?
I am so clean.

05:00.567 --> 05:02.067
- Oh, yeah. Big-time lice.
- Aah!

05:02.069 --> 05:04.503
I wash my hands at least
six times a day.

05:04.505 --> 05:05.771
Toilet seat covers?

05:05.773 --> 05:07.472
Yes, thank you,
even when I pee.

05:07.474 --> 05:09.441
Apparently, none of that
is protection enough,

05:09.443 --> 05:11.576
Not when it comes
to meredith.

05:11.578 --> 05:14.379
[subdued chatter]

05:14.381 --> 05:15.580
- Ooh.
- Oh.

05:15.582 --> 05:17.849
- Hey,
what are you wearing?

05:17.851 --> 05:19.551
- It's a hazmat suit.

05:19.553 --> 05:23.722
That stands for hazardous
materials men's suit wearing.

05:23.724 --> 05:25.390
If you rent
more than four times a year,

05:25.392 --> 05:26.825
It just makes sense
to buy.

05:26.827 --> 05:31.763
Is there anyone else here
that is lice-free?

05:31.765 --> 05:34.399
Excellent. You have
your own hazmat suits?

05:34.401 --> 05:36.335
- No.
- No.

05:36.337 --> 05:37.669
- Ugh. Renters.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.571
Okay, I'm gonna need you
to gather your belongings,

05:39.573 --> 05:41.373
Retreat
to the warehouse.

05:41.375 --> 05:43.442
Conduct
your business there

05:43.444 --> 05:45.544
Until the infected
have been de-loused.

05:45.546 --> 05:46.578
Let's get going.

05:46.580 --> 05:48.013
I'm gonna stay here
and fight.

05:48.015 --> 05:50.382
If you don't hear from me
by lunch, call me.

05:50.384 --> 05:51.683
I might want lunch.

05:51.685 --> 05:54.052
- All right. We're going
down to my warehouse.

05:54.054 --> 05:56.121
That means we're playing
by my rules.

05:56.123 --> 05:57.622
No messing
with the baler,

05:57.624 --> 05:59.057
And be cool
in front of me and val.

05:59.059 --> 06:01.093
We just broke up.
- [gasps]

06:01.095 --> 06:05.364
- Yeah, she ended things.
- Break-ups are the worst.

06:05.366 --> 06:06.732
The only thing
that got me through mine

06:06.734 --> 06:08.633
Was large amounts
of shepherd's pie and brandy.

06:08.635 --> 06:10.569
The singer,
not the drink.

06:10.571 --> 06:12.971
- Here, man.

06:12.973 --> 06:15.374
You need them
more than me.

06:15.376 --> 06:18.810
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah.

06:20.680 --> 06:23.081
- Guys, I think we should
all ease up on meredith.

06:23.083 --> 06:25.083
This has got to be hard
for her.

06:25.085 --> 06:26.084
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

06:26.086 --> 06:28.053
I have not yet
begun to shame.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.488
- That's it.
I'm getting my stuff.

06:29.490 --> 06:30.522
I'm leaving for the day.

06:30.524 --> 06:32.791
- No, stanley,
if you leave now,

06:32.793 --> 06:33.959
Then you'll get it
in your car,

06:33.961 --> 06:34.993
And then you'll get it
in your house!

06:34.995 --> 06:36.094
- Get off me.

06:36.096 --> 06:37.929
- I'm trying to save you
from yourself!

06:37.931 --> 06:40.165
- All right, I'll stay!

06:40.167 --> 06:43.135
There's a pencil
poking in my rolls.

06:43.137 --> 06:45.670
- Maybe it was meredith.

06:45.672 --> 06:47.973
Maybe she brought in lice
that are totally different

06:47.975 --> 06:50.575
Than the lice that I got
from cece.

06:50.577 --> 06:52.744
So let's not jump
to the simplest conclusion

06:52.746 --> 06:54.780
That she got her lice
from me.

06:54.782 --> 06:59.751
That is how wars
get started.

06:59.753 --> 07:03.622
Fine, I'll tell her
it was me.

07:03.624 --> 07:05.957
- Oh, man.
That's fresh-squeezed.

07:05.959 --> 07:08.727
And are all the snacks
complimentary?

07:08.729 --> 07:10.695
- Yeah, take some home
if you want.

07:10.697 --> 07:13.899
- Oh, no, no, no.
That's okay. I...

07:19.605 --> 07:23.775
Um, I'm sorry.
Is this the conference center?

07:23.777 --> 07:25.177
- No.
Mr. Erving called.

07:25.179 --> 07:28.680
Said he's rather meet you
at his private court.

07:28.682 --> 07:33.118
- You gotta be
kidding me.

07:33.120 --> 07:38.190
- Oh, my god.
Meredith, what are you doing?

07:38.192 --> 07:40.225
- Bakin' a cake. What does it
look like I'm doing?

07:40.227 --> 07:42.160
Getting rid of the lice.
- Oh, stop! I'm so sorry!

07:42.162 --> 07:43.995
[microwave oven beeps]
- oh, can you hold that thought?

07:43.997 --> 07:49.100
You know, I think these critters
migrated from down south.

07:49.102 --> 07:50.836
What were you saying?

07:50.838 --> 07:52.771
- Nothing.

07:52.773 --> 07:54.039
I'm going to tell her,

07:54.041 --> 07:56.842
But now is clearly
not the time.

07:56.844 --> 08:00.579
I will buy her a wig,
we'll have a few laughs.

08:00.581 --> 08:03.482
There's a right way
to do this.

08:05.518 --> 08:08.019
- Scalp leeches,
skull vampires,

08:08.021 --> 08:11.022
Follicle gypsies,
hair lawyers.

08:11.024 --> 08:13.658
One thing is clear--
it's kill or be killed!

08:13.660 --> 08:15.660
- No, no, no. It's more
of a nuisance, really.

08:15.662 --> 08:17.162
It's not that big a deal.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.264
So I've collected
your hats and your coats...

08:19.266 --> 08:21.233
- To be burned!
- To be washed.

08:21.235 --> 08:22.934
- What do we do
about our heads?

08:22.936 --> 08:25.270
- I'm not gonna lie.
Lye!

08:25.272 --> 08:27.939
- No.
All we need is mayonnaise.

08:27.941 --> 08:30.642
- Excuse me?
- She's right. It works.

08:30.644 --> 08:31.943
I would imagine.

08:31.945 --> 08:34.913
- Yes. It helps to suffocate
the little buddies,

08:34.915 --> 08:36.648
And it's
a really healthy alternative

08:36.650 --> 08:39.017
To the chemicals found
in most lice shampoos.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.719
- I can appreciate that.

08:40.721 --> 08:45.290
I also only eat
local organic produce.

08:45.292 --> 08:47.893
- Sha-boom!
How do you like me now?

08:47.895 --> 08:49.961
- Oh!
- Wow!

08:49.963 --> 08:51.830
- Take a picture.
It'll last longer.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.765
- We don't want it
to last longer. It's horrible.

08:53.767 --> 08:55.967
- Bald people make me sick.
- Yeah, yeah.

08:55.969 --> 08:57.969
Everybody pile on meredith.

08:57.971 --> 08:59.137
But I'm the only one
with the balls

08:59.139 --> 09:02.974
To show them lice
who's boss.

09:02.976 --> 09:06.645
If everybody just follows
my instructions,

09:06.647 --> 09:08.079
Then nobody else
needs to end up bald.

09:08.081 --> 09:10.315
Not that it looks bad,
meredith.

09:10.317 --> 09:12.984
It looks--
it looks awesome.

09:12.986 --> 09:15.720
You look like a baby
who suddenly aged 50 years.

09:15.722 --> 09:18.924
A cute baby, but something
sucked the life force out of it.

09:18.926 --> 09:20.792
I'm so sorry.
We need mayonnaise.

09:20.794 --> 09:22.928
We need it now.
- Oh, uh, uh, I'll go.

09:22.930 --> 09:24.129
- Okay.
- Oh, thank you.

09:24.131 --> 09:25.330
- You're a saint, pam.

09:25.332 --> 09:27.999
Uh, meredith, could I get you
something special

09:28.001 --> 09:32.037
Candy or--or one
of those stylish turbans?

09:32.039 --> 09:33.104
- Thanks, pam.

09:33.106 --> 09:34.806
I'll take a pack
of nicorette gum

09:34.808 --> 09:35.807
And a pack of kools.

09:35.809 --> 09:38.643
- Okay.

09:40.613 --> 09:42.881
- Let's talk pubes,
people.

09:42.883 --> 09:47.719
- Hey, darryl.
- Oh, hey, val.

09:50.323 --> 09:53.224
- Darryl.
Oh, that was tragic.

09:53.226 --> 09:56.361
Oh, that was like a car crash.
I couldn't look away.

09:56.363 --> 09:59.264
You two still clearly have
feelings for each other.

09:59.266 --> 10:00.899
- Yeah.

10:00.901 --> 10:02.300
- What's gonna make you
feel better, big guy?

10:02.302 --> 10:04.035
- When I was a kid,

10:04.037 --> 10:05.637
My grandmother used to
make me chocolate cake

10:05.639 --> 10:07.672
When I wasn't feeling good.

10:07.674 --> 10:09.674
She's not around to do that
anymore.

10:09.676 --> 10:15.847
I just need a moment to myself,
just to clear my head.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.048
- Oh, poor darryl.

10:17.050 --> 10:18.984
I can't bear to see him
suffer like this.

10:18.986 --> 10:21.987
- I think he needs
some hugs

10:21.989 --> 10:24.723
And maybe
some chocolate cake.

10:24.725 --> 10:28.159
- Mmm. This won't help him.
It's a muffin, not cake.

10:28.161 --> 10:29.327
- Listen,
let's try and get darryl

10:29.329 --> 10:30.895
The one thing
in the world

10:30.897 --> 10:33.264
He clearly wants
and needs the most.

10:33.266 --> 10:37.168
- An escalade.
- Or what's her name.

10:37.170 --> 10:39.037
- Val.

10:39.039 --> 10:41.940
- Let's get darryl val.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.875
- I hope you don't mind me
bringing you out here.

10:43.877 --> 10:45.410
I can't get my knees
under a desk.

10:45.412 --> 10:46.811
- Are you kidding me?

10:46.813 --> 10:48.413
I could literally
scalp tickets to this.

10:48.415 --> 10:50.649
- Well, you think you could
sink one from deep?

10:50.651 --> 10:53.218
- Listen, I don't mean
to intimidate you,

10:53.220 --> 10:54.919
But I did play
a little high school ball.

10:54.921 --> 10:59.057
- Okay.

10:59.059 --> 11:02.661
Wow. Halpert's got game.
All right.

11:02.663 --> 11:05.330
[cell phone rings]
- oh, sorry. I'm so sorry.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.365
This is my wife.
Can I take this?

11:07.367 --> 11:09.334
- If it's your wife,
you better take it.

11:09.336 --> 11:12.237
- Right?
[laughs]

11:12.239 --> 11:15.040
Hey, what's up?
Everything okay?

11:15.042 --> 11:16.708
- Oh, no.
Everything's great.

11:16.710 --> 11:19.411
Um, I was just calling to see,
uh, how the meeting went.

11:19.413 --> 11:21.913
- Oh, it's still happening
right now, actually, so--

11:21.915 --> 11:23.882
- He's, uh, really making you
work for it, huh?

11:23.884 --> 11:27.952
- Yes, it is very stressful.
Are you sure everything's okay?

11:27.954 --> 11:30.455
- Great.
I am killing it over here.

11:30.457 --> 11:33.024
[splat]

11:33.026 --> 11:35.293
Jim, I gotta go.
- Okay, bye.

11:35.295 --> 11:38.029
So sorry about that.
- Oh, no problem.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.464
Hey, jim, what size
do you wear, man?

11:39.466 --> 11:42.167
I got a pair of japanese nikes
with your name on 'em.

11:42.169 --> 11:45.704
What do you think?
- I love it.

11:45.706 --> 11:47.005
- Once it's all over
your head,

11:47.007 --> 11:51.176
That will be enough time
for the lice to fall asleep,

11:51.178 --> 11:53.378
Suffocate,
and then pass away.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.080
- Oh, sure.

11:55.082 --> 11:57.215
And when you're ready
to get serious,

11:57.217 --> 12:00.985
Come to me
to get it done right.

12:00.987 --> 12:04.756
- Put those away
before you hurt yourself.

12:04.758 --> 12:05.757
[fabric rips]

12:05.759 --> 12:08.426
- [gasps]
- oh, god. Oh, no.

12:08.428 --> 12:12.430
No. No!

12:12.432 --> 12:15.967
No! No! No!

12:15.969 --> 12:19.137
No! No!

12:19.139 --> 12:21.039
- Okay, it's easier
with a buddy,

12:21.041 --> 12:22.741
So everybody pair up.

12:22.743 --> 12:25.043
- Oscar, you want to be
my partner?

12:25.045 --> 12:28.279
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.
I'd love to.

12:28.281 --> 12:31.049
- Hey, uh, mayo buddy,
$5 tip,

12:31.051 --> 12:33.251
You unclog my ears, okay?

12:33.253 --> 12:35.353
- Oh, creed,
I'm so sorry.

12:35.355 --> 12:37.956
I'm--I'm already partners
with pete. Right, pete?

12:37.958 --> 12:39.190
- Uh, yeah.

12:39.192 --> 12:41.326
We promised each other
if we ever got lice,

12:41.328 --> 12:44.929
We'd buddy up,
so, sorry, man.

12:44.931 --> 12:48.967
- Hey, creed.
Want to be my buddy?

12:48.969 --> 12:52.036
- Oh, god.
Stuck with the weirdo.

12:52.038 --> 12:56.908
- [sighs]

12:56.910 --> 12:57.909
[hard slaps]

12:57.911 --> 12:58.977
- Angela.

12:58.979 --> 13:01.146
- You don't want bugs,
you know?

13:01.148 --> 13:05.016
Who knows where those bugs
will end up.

13:05.018 --> 13:07.552
- You're getting a bargain.
I ain't got no hair no more.

13:07.554 --> 13:10.054
- [sighs]

13:10.056 --> 13:14.926
- Creed, I'm all done.
My turn.

13:14.928 --> 13:18.096
- I'm sorry, pam.
It looks a little messy.

13:18.098 --> 13:20.064
- Well, wait.

13:23.169 --> 13:25.970
- How's that?
- I feel it working.

13:25.972 --> 13:28.039
[both grunt]

13:28.041 --> 13:29.974
- Ksk, ksk, ksk, ksk, ksk.

13:29.976 --> 13:32.310
- Eiffel tower.
- Oh! [laughs]

13:32.312 --> 13:34.479
- Now.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.014
- Can I help you?

13:36.016 --> 13:37.348
- Well--
- um--

13:37.350 --> 13:38.883
- We don't want to pry,

13:38.885 --> 13:40.552
But we heard you broke up
with darryl.

13:40.554 --> 13:41.986
- Yeah, that's true.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.822
- We think you made
a big, big mistake.

13:43.824 --> 13:46.024
- Big mistake.
- Quite enormous.

13:46.026 --> 13:49.327
- He's a real catch,
and you should take him back.

13:49.329 --> 13:52.363
- Okay. Thank you.
Is that all?

13:52.365 --> 13:54.465
- No.
No, that is not all.

13:54.467 --> 13:56.968
Let me tell you
what real life is like.

13:56.970 --> 13:59.070
The men dry up,
and the nights get lonely.

13:59.072 --> 14:00.939
The only calls
on your machine

14:00.941 --> 14:02.073
Are from collection agencies

14:02.075 --> 14:03.341
About that pair
of motorcycle boots

14:03.343 --> 14:07.912
You stalk your old
high school boyfriend online,

14:07.914 --> 14:10.381
Go to his daughter's
soccer games, and make a scene.

14:10.383 --> 14:12.483
You buy a diamond ring
for yourself,

14:12.485 --> 14:13.952
Wear it
on your right hand,

14:13.954 --> 14:16.120
And tell yourself
you're all you need.

14:16.122 --> 14:19.490
One day,
you're alone, tired.

14:19.492 --> 14:21.559
At your feet,
a dying bird.

14:21.561 --> 14:23.261
But where
did it come from?

14:23.263 --> 14:25.063
Why did you kill it?

14:25.065 --> 14:26.931
It is because,
in some strange way,

14:26.933 --> 14:28.466
It is you?

14:28.468 --> 14:30.401
- Thank you all
for your concern,

14:30.403 --> 14:33.004
But I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave, okay?

14:33.006 --> 14:36.507
- Pfft! Well.
- Thank you.

14:36.509 --> 14:38.877
Thank you.

14:38.879 --> 14:41.145
- So does this mean
you're gonna take darryl back?

14:41.147 --> 14:42.947
- No.

14:42.949 --> 14:44.048
- Well, then,
what would you say

14:44.050 --> 14:47.285
To you and me
hitting the town?

14:47.287 --> 14:51.122
'cause I'm free,
literally, forever.

14:51.124 --> 14:53.224
- Yeah,
kevin asked me out.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.460
I was kind of feeling good about
re-entering the dating pool,

14:55.462 --> 14:57.629
And then kevin
asked me out.

14:57.631 --> 15:01.032
Thought I might trade up
to a new level of man.

15:01.034 --> 15:06.070
Then kevin asked me out.

15:10.509 --> 15:12.243
[phone rings]

15:12.245 --> 15:15.013
[mayonnaise splats]

15:15.015 --> 15:16.948
- Hello?
- Hi, honey, it's mom.

15:16.950 --> 15:18.549
Look, cece's school
just called.

15:18.551 --> 15:22.086
She still has lice.
- What? No, that can't--

15:22.088 --> 15:23.421
I don't--
- now, don't worry, don't worry.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.056
I'm on my way
to pick her up,

15:25.058 --> 15:26.457
But you might
have lice too.

15:26.459 --> 15:27.659
You know,
lice can be tricky.

15:27.661 --> 15:30.028
Sometimes lice, like...
[phone clatters]

15:30.030 --> 15:32.563
- Oh, my god.
- Shave her head.

15:32.565 --> 15:36.100
Shave her head!

15:39.071 --> 15:40.338
[overlapping arguing]

15:40.340 --> 15:44.042
It's just been so chaotic
with jim gone that I--

15:44.044 --> 15:45.410
- Yeah, yeah,
princess fancy-pants

15:45.412 --> 15:47.645
Letting jane 12-pack over here
take the fall!

15:47.647 --> 15:49.514
- [amplified]
she's right, pam.

15:49.516 --> 15:51.382
- Is there a volume knob
on that thing?

15:51.384 --> 15:54.485
- Yes, there's a volume knob
on that thing!

15:54.487 --> 15:59.958
- Meredith,
I am so sorry.

15:59.960 --> 16:02.393
- Well, a lot of good your
sorrys are doing her now, pam.

16:02.395 --> 16:05.997
She's a monster.

16:05.999 --> 16:08.633
- I meant to say something
earlier. I just--

16:08.635 --> 16:13.304
- Just? Just what?
Just forgot?

16:13.306 --> 16:16.207
Who's the one that didn't
bring lice into the office?

16:16.209 --> 16:18.142
Meredith.

16:18.144 --> 16:19.744
Sure, I gave everybody
pink-eye once,

16:19.746 --> 16:21.412
And my ex keyed
a few of their cars.

16:21.414 --> 16:25.016
And, yeah, I bmed
in the shredder on new year's,

16:25.018 --> 16:26.517
But I didn't bring
the lice in.

16:26.519 --> 16:29.721
That was all pam.

16:29.723 --> 16:32.023
- [amplified]
attention, people of the office,

16:32.025 --> 16:36.427
You have exactly 60 seconds
to evacuate the bullpen.

16:36.429 --> 16:39.597
At that time,
I will be tossing

16:39.599 --> 16:42.066
This powerful
insecticidal grenade,

16:42.068 --> 16:47.505
Which contains
piperonyl butoxide as well as--

16:50.410 --> 16:53.311

16:53.313 --> 16:57.215
Whoa. Hypertoxide has
a mild hallucinogenic effect,

16:57.217 --> 16:58.549
But I don't think
it's kicked in yet.

16:58.551 --> 17:00.718
I'm gonna count down
from ten.

17:10.397 --> 17:13.297
- Wow.
He got to purple.

17:15.300 --> 17:16.467
- Ow!

17:16.469 --> 17:19.037
- Sorry.

17:19.039 --> 17:22.507
- [chokes and sputters]
you're waterboarding me!

17:22.509 --> 17:26.310
- Oops.

17:33.619 --> 17:37.288
- No, this is fine.
We're allowed to do this.

17:37.290 --> 17:42.360
This is okay.

17:42.362 --> 17:44.195
- Okay, you're up.

17:44.197 --> 17:47.331
- Yeah, I'm actually kind of sad
to see this baby go.

17:47.333 --> 17:49.367
- You do kind of
look like elvis,

17:49.369 --> 17:54.572
But we should probably wash
all the dead lice out.

17:57.242 --> 18:01.245
- Okay.
- Okay. Okay.

18:04.283 --> 18:05.683
Is that too cold?

- No. Actually,
it feels kind of nice.

over there.

I've been sitting here
the whole time.

18:22.802 --> 18:26.237

18:29.475 --> 18:31.175
- Okay.
- Huh?

18:31.177 --> 18:33.444
- Let's give it a shot.
Let's make it work.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.413
- Oh, no.
I mean, I want to.

18:35.415 --> 18:37.381
I just--I don't want
to force you into doing

18:37.383 --> 18:38.816
Something
you don't want to do.

18:38.818 --> 18:42.286
- You're not.
I believe in us.

18:42.288 --> 18:46.657
- But--

18:46.659 --> 18:50.361
I'm back together
with val.

18:50.363 --> 18:52.697
Yay.

18:56.503 --> 18:58.369
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

today.

18:59.572 --> 19:02.673
Not everything went exactly
according to plan,

19:02.675 --> 19:06.410
But, lice,
if you are watching,

19:06.412 --> 19:10.148
I am ready for you anytime,
anywhere.

erin already take off?

- I guess so.

- You're kareem,
coming to help.

19:27.567 --> 19:29.367

That makes total sense.

I'm kareem.
You're dr. J.

19:37.510 --> 19:38.943
- And that's all.
- That's it.

- No one will believe this
back home, but that's okay.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.413
[phone ringing]
let me show you how it's done.

19:42.415 --> 19:44.382

19:48.688 --> 19:51.255
Just trying to catch you

20:04.404 --> 20:07.538
My mom's been watching
the kids all day.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.740
- Let her stay another hour.
Let's go get a beer.

20:09.742 --> 20:13.544

sounds incredible right now.

20:13.546 --> 20:16.847

You're buying.

20:16.849 --> 20:18.583

20:18.585 --> 20:21.586
- Meredith, I am so sorry
about today.

20:21.588 --> 20:23.487
- Forget about it.

20:23.489 --> 20:25.623
- I just did not realize
how hard it was gonna be

20:25.625 --> 20:27.758
Without jim.

I really respect you

in half a week.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.666
I have to say, there are
not a lot of people

20:35.668 --> 20:38.569
Who could pull off a shaved
head, but you're rocking it.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.004
- Right?

20:40.006 --> 20:41.505

phone number

20:41.507 --> 20:44.508
