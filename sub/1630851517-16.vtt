00:01.568 --> 00:03.436
{\an5}<i>Previously on</i> Young Sheldon...

00:01.568 --> 00:03.436
Apparently,

00:03.503 --> 00:05.739
the football boosters think
I'm not doing my job.

00:05.805 --> 00:07.374
You know you're gonna have
to talk to them, right?

00:07.440 --> 00:08.274
Yes.

00:08.341 --> 00:09.709
Maybe I should come.

00:09.776 --> 00:12.078
(scoffs) I'm not gonna
insult their children.

00:12.145 --> 00:13.346
You sure?

00:13.413 --> 00:15.215
Okay, come.

00:15.281 --> 00:16.216
I got a question.

00:16.282 --> 00:17.350
Go ahead, Roy.

00:17.417 --> 00:19.252
What in the hell
were you thinking

00:19.319 --> 00:21.421
punting with a minute 24
on the clock?

00:21.488 --> 00:22.555
Meeting's over.

00:22.622 --> 00:23.656
{\an3}FLOYD:
There it is.

00:23.723 --> 00:25.291
The Cooper Surrender.

00:25.358 --> 00:26.493
{\an5}(laughter)

00:25.358 --> 00:26.493
The Cooper Surrender.

00:26.559 --> 00:27.727
{\an1}GEORGE SR.:
Bye-bye.

00:27.794 --> 00:29.662
Guess what,
I'm buying a laundromat.

00:29.729 --> 00:32.432
DALE:
<i>So there's a secret back room</i>

00:32.499 --> 00:34.534
<i>at the laundromat</i>
<i>where you gamble?</i>

00:34.601 --> 00:35.602
(whoops)

00:35.668 --> 00:36.669
<i>Give me a sense</i>

00:36.736 --> 00:38.304
for how illegal this is.

00:38.371 --> 00:39.639
Who says it's illegal?

00:39.706 --> 00:41.040
Well, why is it a secret?

00:41.107 --> 00:42.442
Okay, it's illegal.

00:44.377 --> 00:47.547
{\an5}ADULT SHELDON:
<i>Today I thought we could talk</i>
<i>about relationships,</i>

00:47.614 --> 00:50.316
<i>so I've invited my lovely wife</i>
<i>Amy to help.</i>

00:50.383 --> 00:51.651
AMY:
<i>Thanks for letting me join in.</i>

00:51.718 --> 00:54.087
{\an5}ADULT SHELDON:
<i>Are you jealous</i>
<i>when I do this without you?</i>

00:54.154 --> 00:56.289
{\an5}AMY: <i> No.</i>

00:54.154 --> 00:56.289
ADULT SHELDON: <i> Because one of</i>
<i>the most common sources</i>

00:56.356 --> 00:58.591
<i>of conflict</i>
<i>in relationships is jealousy.</i>

00:58.658 --> 01:01.161
<i>Now, Amy, did you know</i>
<i>jealousy is triggered</i>

01:01.227 --> 01:03.062
<i>in the left part</i>
<i>of the cerebral cortex?</i>

01:03.129 --> 01:05.632
{\an5}AMY:
<i>I'm sorry, are you about</i>
<i>to explain neuroscience</i>

01:05.698 --> 01:08.802
<i>to your wife, the Nobel</i>
<i>Prize-winning neuroscientist?</i>

01:08.868 --> 01:11.204
{\an5}ADULT SHELDON: <i> Yes. Jealous?</i>

01:08.868 --> 01:11.204
AMY: <i> I'll tell you when there</i>
<i>isn't</i>

01:11.271 --> 01:13.540
{\an5}<i>a microphone in front of us.</i>

01:11.271 --> 01:13.540
ADULT SHELDON: <i> Ooh, mystery.</i>

01:13.606 --> 01:15.475
<i>That'll keep</i>
<i>a relationship on its toes.</i>

01:15.542 --> 01:17.577
{\an5}AMY:
<i>Your bathroom schedule</i>
<i>is on the refrigerator.</i>

01:17.644 --> 01:19.279
<i>We have no mystery.</i>

01:19.345 --> 01:22.449
ADULT SHELDON:
<i>Moving on, physical intimacy.</i>

01:22.515 --> 01:24.484
<i>I believe I said</i>
<i>"physical intimacy,"</i>

01:24.551 --> 01:27.587
<i>which can pose another</i>
<i>challenge in relationships.</i>

01:27.654 --> 01:30.590
{\an5}AMY:
<i>Especially when one partner</i>
<i>doesn't want to be intimate</i>

01:30.657 --> 01:32.292
<i>as frequently as the other.</i>

01:32.358 --> 01:33.526
ADULT SHELDON:
<i>Ooh, who are we talking about?</i>

01:33.593 --> 01:34.727
<i>(stammers)</i>
<i>Don't tell me.</i>

01:34.794 --> 01:36.629
<i>Let the mystery continue.</i>

01:36.696 --> 01:39.165
AMY:
<i>Just read the next one.</i>

01:39.232 --> 01:41.701
{\an5}ADULT SHELDON:
<i>Money is a frequent source</i>
<i>of conflict in a relationship.</i>

01:41.768 --> 01:44.103
{\an5}AMY:
<i>Thankfully that's never</i>
<i>been a problem for us.</i>

01:44.170 --> 01:46.473
{\an5}ADULT SHELDON:
<i>Says the woman who took away</i>
<i>my comic book allowance.</i>

01:46.539 --> 01:48.875
{\an5}AMY:
<i>To start a college fund</i>
<i>for our children.</i>

01:48.942 --> 01:50.410
ADULT SHELDON:
<i>Comic books are an investment.</i>

01:50.477 --> 01:51.644
AMY:
<i>There are better places</i>

01:51.711 --> 01:53.813
<i>to invest our money than that</i>
<i>weird wolf man you like.</i>

01:53.880 --> 01:56.416
{\an5}ADULT SHELDON:
<i>His name is Wolverine</i>
<i>and you know it.</i>

01:56.483 --> 01:58.785
{\an5}AMY:
<i>Okay we're off on a tangent.</i>
<i>I'm taking over.</i>

01:58.852 --> 02:01.788
<i>Money can be a source</i>
<i>of conflict in a relationship,</i>

02:01.855 --> 02:03.556
<i>even having too much.</i>

02:03.623 --> 02:04.691
ADULT SHELDON:
<i>Wh... Hey, this is my story.</i>

02:04.757 --> 02:07.260
AMY:
<i>I know. Jealous?</i>

02:08.761 --> 02:10.263
I need to show you something.

02:10.330 --> 02:12.332
{\an5}Okay.

02:10.330 --> 02:12.332
Now, don't freak out.

02:12.398 --> 02:13.766
Well, that's not helping.

02:16.402 --> 02:17.570
{\an3}Whoa.

02:17.637 --> 02:19.305
The gambling room's doing well.

02:19.372 --> 02:22.408
{\an1}I can see that, Scarface.
But why is it here?

02:22.475 --> 02:24.677
Well, I can't exactly
take it down to the bank.

02:24.744 --> 02:27.480
{\an4}Why not?

02:24.744 --> 02:27.480
They'd bust me
for money laundering.

02:27.547 --> 02:30.416
{\an1}Well, it's small bills.
Tell them you're a stripper.

02:30.483 --> 02:32.485
It's $14,000.

02:32.552 --> 02:34.287
{\an1}Well, tell them
you're a good stripper.

<i>Especially when the grandma</i>

03:01.981 --> 03:04.317
{\an4}Whoa.

03:01.981 --> 03:04.317
{\an3}Oh, my.

03:04.384 --> 03:05.718
Did you mean to give us
ten dollar bills?

03:05.785 --> 03:07.186
Because these are hundreds.

03:07.253 --> 03:08.321
I'm gonna kick your ass.

{\an9}MEEMAW:
I know it's a lot,

03:09.422 --> 03:10.723
{\an8}but why not see you enjoy it

03:10.790 --> 03:12.592
{\an8}while I'm still around?

03:12.659 --> 03:14.360
{\an8}Ooh, there's
an inheritance, too?

03:14.427 --> 03:17.497
{\an8}Well, depends on how
you treat me in my golden years.

03:17.564 --> 03:18.565
{\an7}I'm not interested
in your money, Meemaw.

03:18.631 --> 03:20.333
{\an8}You're pretty and I love you.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.335
{\an8}Now, don't you have something
to say to me?

03:22.402 --> 03:24.237
{\an7}Thank you.

03:22.402 --> 03:24.237
{\an8}I'm rich.

03:24.971 --> 03:25.905
{\an8}WILKINS: <i> Morning.</i>

03:25.972 --> 03:28.308
{\an8}Morning.

03:29.275 --> 03:30.610
{\an8}So, how you holding up?

03:30.677 --> 03:32.612
{\an8}What does that mean?

03:32.679 --> 03:33.713
{\an8}Nothing.

03:40.820 --> 03:42.755
{\an8}What?

03:44.557 --> 03:46.359
{\an8}There's no easy way to say this,

03:46.426 --> 03:47.894
{\an9}so I'm just
gonna say it.

03:47.961 --> 03:50.229
{\an8}I was at a meeting last night
with the boosters.

03:50.296 --> 03:51.698
{\an8}Without me?

03:51.764 --> 03:53.266
{\an9}They might've thought
that would be uncomfortable,

03:53.333 --> 03:54.934
{\an8}seeing as it was about you.

03:55.001 --> 03:56.436
{\an8}About me how?

03:56.502 --> 03:58.838
{\an8}Well, they were
floating the idea

03:58.905 --> 04:00.840
{\an8}of me being head coach
next year.

04:00.907 --> 04:02.575
{\an8}What the hell, Wayne?

04:02.642 --> 04:04.277
{\an8}I didn't know what it
was gonna be about.

04:04.344 --> 04:05.511
{\an8}Well, what did you tell them?

04:05.578 --> 04:06.913
{\an8}Look, I want you
to keep your job.

04:06.980 --> 04:08.648
{\an8}Well, then tell them
you're not interested.

04:08.715 --> 04:10.350
{\an8}But...

04:10.416 --> 04:11.751
{\an8}if you're not gonna
keep your job,

04:11.818 --> 04:13.486
{\an8}I want your job.

04:13.553 --> 04:15.655
{\an8}Really? You want to spend
your days coaching lazy kids

04:15.722 --> 04:16.789
{\an8}and getting yelled at
by their parents?

04:16.856 --> 04:18.458
{\an8}Come on, George.

04:18.524 --> 04:20.026
{\an8}Don't forget the dirty looks
after you lose,

04:20.093 --> 04:22.295
{\an8}like you're the one that fumbled
on the three-yard line.

04:22.362 --> 04:23.663
{\an8}That's the job you want?

04:23.730 --> 04:25.365
{\an8}It's called coaching, George.

04:25.431 --> 04:26.566
{\an8}GEORGE SR.:
<i>I mean, how could Wayne</i>

04:26.633 --> 04:28.401
{\an8}stab me in the back like this?

04:28.468 --> 04:30.403
{\an8}I don't think Wayne
stabbed you in the back.

04:30.470 --> 04:31.971
{\an8}Can you please
just agree with me?

04:32.038 --> 04:33.806
{\an9}Sorry.

04:33.873 --> 04:35.541
{\an8}So, what happens now?

04:35.608 --> 04:37.543
{\an8}I don't know. I guess
I wait and see if I'm fired.

04:37.610 --> 04:41.280
{\an8}Well, if that happens, you
can always get another job.

04:41.347 --> 04:43.383
{\an8}Medford has one high school.
(stammers)

04:43.449 --> 04:45.418
{\an8}Another job could mean moving.

04:45.485 --> 04:47.987
{\an8}But our roots are here.

04:48.054 --> 04:49.622
{\an8}My mom is here.

04:49.689 --> 04:51.658
{\an8}So, moving's got its upsides.

04:53.559 --> 04:55.428
{\an8}Didn't Sheldon's college
talk to you

04:55.495 --> 04:57.296
{\an8}about coaching there once?

04:57.363 --> 04:58.631
{\an8}That's right, they did.

04:58.698 --> 05:00.466
{\an8}And you know the president

05:00.533 --> 05:02.001
{\an8}pretty well now.

05:00.533 --> 05:02.001
{\an7}I do.

05:02.068 --> 05:05.371
{\an8}And they're used to losing,
so it's low pressure.

05:05.438 --> 05:07.407
{\an8}Thank you.

05:08.975 --> 05:09.976
{\an8}You have a calculator
I can borrow?

05:10.043 --> 05:11.577
{\an8}Yes, but I'm using it.

05:11.644 --> 05:12.812
{\an8}No, you're not.

05:13.946 --> 05:15.748
{\an9}Why do you need
a calculator?

05:15.815 --> 05:17.650
{\an8}I'm trying to figure out
what to spend my money on.

05:17.717 --> 05:19.752
{\an7}What are you gonna
do with yours?

05:19.819 --> 05:21.454
{\an8}I'm glad you asked.

05:21.521 --> 05:22.989
{\an8}I'm dipping my toe
in the exciting world

05:23.056 --> 05:25.491
{\an8}of the stock market
by purchasing three shares

05:25.558 --> 05:27.760
{\an8}of RadioShack.

05:25.558 --> 05:27.760
{\an8}Why?

05:27.827 --> 05:29.662
{\an8}Well, as a shareholder,
I'll be partial owner

05:29.729 --> 05:31.531
{\an8}of my very favorite company.

05:31.597 --> 05:34.000
{\an8}See, when companies go public,
they sell shares of stock...

05:34.067 --> 05:35.968
I'll just buy my own calculator.

05:39.472 --> 05:40.873
Thank you for seeing me,
President Hagemeyer.

05:40.940 --> 05:44.477
Of course.
My door is open to all Coopers.

05:44.544 --> 05:47.580
Even Alice Cooper, who
I've always found oddly sexy.

05:48.614 --> 05:49.849
Don't think we're related,

05:49.916 --> 05:50.950
but if I meet him,
I'll let him know.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.085
(chuckles)

05:52.151 --> 05:53.619
So, what can I do for you?

05:53.686 --> 05:55.555
When y'all were
first recruiting Sheldon,

05:55.621 --> 05:58.024
you offered me a chance to head
up your football program.

05:58.091 --> 05:59.525
And you turned us down.

05:59.592 --> 06:00.426
I was right in the middle
of rebuilding

06:00.493 --> 06:02.695
Medford's team, but now,

06:02.762 --> 06:04.063
I'm ready for a new challenge.

06:04.130 --> 06:05.765
Well, Mr. Cooper...

06:05.832 --> 06:08.367
Please, call me Coach.

06:08.434 --> 06:10.136
{\an3}Oh, and this just
occurred to me,

06:10.203 --> 06:11.938
but, uh, if I were here,

06:12.004 --> 06:13.706
I could help
keep an eye on Sheldon,

06:13.773 --> 06:15.108
take some of the burden off you.

06:15.174 --> 06:18.044
(laughs):
Oh, your son is no burden.

06:18.111 --> 06:20.379
He's a pain in the ass, ma'am.
You can say it.

06:20.446 --> 06:22.915
{\an4}Well, whether he is
or he isn't...

06:20.446 --> 06:22.915
{\an3}He is.

06:22.982 --> 06:25.017
...we don't have
a football team anymore.

06:26.686 --> 06:28.154
What?

06:28.221 --> 06:30.089
You're a university in Texas.

06:30.156 --> 06:32.992
We are a science-focused
university.

06:33.059 --> 06:35.661
But you got that whole stadium.

06:35.728 --> 06:37.063
Well, we still have soccer.

06:37.130 --> 06:38.598
{\an1}Oh.

06:38.664 --> 06:40.900
What-what about Texas A&amp;M?

06:40.967 --> 06:43.069
Pretty sure they have
a football program.

06:43.136 --> 06:45.738
Yeah, if that doesn't work,
maybe I'll try the Cowboys.

06:45.805 --> 06:47.774
Hey, reach for the stars.
(chuckles)

06:59.185 --> 06:59.752
{\an3}DALE:
George?

06:59.819 --> 07:00.787
{\an1}Hey, Dale.

07:00.853 --> 07:01.988
Surprised to see you here.

07:02.054 --> 07:03.656
Are you?

07:03.723 --> 07:04.724
Not even a little.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.930
You ever hear of a Texas college
that only plays soccer?

07:10.997 --> 07:12.598
(sighs)
Can I get a beer first

07:12.665 --> 07:14.667
before we start
with the hard questions?

07:17.603 --> 07:21.107
I went to Sheldon's college
for a possible coaching gig.

07:21.174 --> 07:22.942
They don't even have
a team anymore.

07:23.009 --> 07:25.678
Huh. So you're looking
for a new job?

07:25.745 --> 07:27.513
Something like that.

07:29.015 --> 07:31.584
Well, there's plenty
of teams out there.

07:31.651 --> 07:33.085
Yeah, but I'm starting to think

07:33.152 --> 07:35.221
{\an1}it's gonna be
the same BS wherever I go.

07:35.288 --> 07:36.856
That's how I feel about life.

07:36.923 --> 07:38.624
Wherever I go...
(blows raspberry)

07:38.691 --> 07:40.693
(chuckles)
Yeah.

07:40.760 --> 07:41.961
You ever think about
doing something different?

07:42.028 --> 07:44.063
Well, I played football,
I coach football,

07:44.130 --> 07:45.565
I watch a lot of football.

07:45.631 --> 07:48.634
So unless sitting here
becomes a job...

07:48.701 --> 07:50.069
How about selling footballs?

07:51.204 --> 07:52.605
You mean, like, at your store?

07:52.672 --> 07:54.140
Yeah. I could always
use the help.

07:54.207 --> 07:55.575
I'm not looking for a handout.

07:55.641 --> 07:56.876
That's not what this is.

07:56.943 --> 07:58.845
I'd love to have more time off.

07:58.911 --> 08:00.246
And it could be nice to have
someone at the store

08:00.313 --> 08:01.848
who I could trust.

08:01.914 --> 08:03.516
Well, thanks, uh...

08:03.583 --> 08:04.951
I'll think about it.

08:05.017 --> 08:06.652
Well, don't thank me,
I'm just taking advantage

08:06.719 --> 08:08.521
of your crappy situation.

08:08.588 --> 08:10.056
How do you know I'm not
taking advantage of yours?

08:10.122 --> 08:12.091
Because I'm a very
successful businessman,

08:12.158 --> 08:14.026
and you're sitting here
in the middle of the day.

08:14.093 --> 08:15.027
Well, you're here, too.

08:15.094 --> 08:17.129

{\an8}ADULT SHELDON: <i> I'd only been</i>
<i>a shareholder for one day</i>

08:19.765 --> 08:22.535
{\an8}<i>and I was already reveling</i>
<i>in the giddy thrill</i>

08:22.602 --> 08:24.871
{\an8}<i>in being part owner</i>
<i>of a thriving tech company.</i>

08:24.937 --> 08:28.507
Hello, RadioShack.
Sheldon Cooper, shareholder.

08:28.574 --> 08:30.276
I just wanted to let you know
I'm so excited

08:30.343 --> 08:31.744
to be part of the team.

08:31.811 --> 08:33.145
While I sound young,
rest assured,

08:33.212 --> 08:35.514
I'm far more intelligent
than my age would imply.

08:35.581 --> 08:37.049
So if there's anything
I can do to help,

08:37.116 --> 08:38.818
budgeting, product design,
finding a word

08:38.885 --> 08:41.254
more impressive than "shack,"
I'm your man.

{\an5}ADULT SHELDON:
<i>My sister had taken</i>
<i>a different path with her money.</i>

08:48.828 --> 08:49.929
What is that?

08:49.996 --> 08:53.633
{\an5}It's a cotton candy machine.

08:49.996 --> 08:53.633
{\an3}Why?

08:53.699 --> 08:56.569
It's a machine that makes
free cotton candy.

08:56.636 --> 08:58.170
It's not free, you paid for it.

08:58.237 --> 08:59.105
Meemaw paid for it.

08:59.171 --> 09:01.307
And it's still better
than lame stocks.

09:01.374 --> 09:02.808
You're going to end up
with a stomach ache

09:02.875 --> 09:04.610
while I get to be
part of America's

09:04.677 --> 09:06.579
favorite electronics retailer.

09:10.683 --> 09:13.753
{\an3}Really? George is gonna
work at your store?

09:13.819 --> 09:15.187
Yeah, well,
he's gonna give it a try

09:15.254 --> 09:18.090
on nights and weekends,
see if he likes it.

09:18.157 --> 09:19.625
Hmm. And what if he does?

09:19.692 --> 09:21.761
Well, hopefully,
I can start stepping back.

09:21.827 --> 09:22.962
To do what?

09:23.029 --> 09:24.196
Well, I got money in the bank,

09:24.263 --> 09:26.799
and you got some in a suitcase.

09:26.866 --> 09:28.200
{\an1}Well, we could
put it together,

09:28.267 --> 09:32.305
we could travel,
we could buy a vacation home.

09:32.371 --> 09:33.639
Well, I can't just up and leave.

09:33.706 --> 09:35.308
I mean, I got the gambling room.

09:35.374 --> 09:38.210
Georgie can take care of that,
and besides, what's the use

09:38.277 --> 09:40.246
of having all that money
and not enjoying it?

09:40.313 --> 09:41.914
I guess.

09:41.981 --> 09:44.050
God, we could go to Mexico

09:44.116 --> 09:44.717
and get a cabana

09:44.784 --> 09:46.252
and spend days on the beach.

09:46.319 --> 09:48.120
And our nights on the toilet?

09:48.187 --> 09:50.122
(both laugh)

09:50.189 --> 09:52.191
Yeah, doesn't sound half bad.

09:55.227 --> 09:56.295
What's up?

09:56.362 --> 09:57.763
I figured out you can put

09:57.830 --> 09:58.798
all kinds of candy
in the machine.

09:58.864 --> 09:59.799
Try this.

09:59.865 --> 10:01.267
Why is it brown?

10:01.334 --> 10:03.269
It's butterscotch
from Meemaw's candy bowl.

10:03.336 --> 10:05.805
(scoffs) I think that candy's
older than you.

10:05.871 --> 10:07.740
Doesn't taste like it.

10:11.010 --> 10:12.211
Not bad.

10:12.278 --> 10:14.013
I'm gonna bring
a bunch to school.

10:14.080 --> 10:15.915
How much you gonna
charge for it?

10:15.982 --> 10:17.750
Nothing. They're my friends.

10:17.817 --> 10:20.186
You think Ronald McDonald
let his friends eat for free?

10:20.252 --> 10:22.388
Ronald McDonald isn't real.

10:23.956 --> 10:26.058
The point is, you shouldn't
give this away for free.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.293
How much would I even charge?

10:27.360 --> 10:29.328
Hmm. How about 50 cents?

10:29.395 --> 10:31.797
They only cost me, like,
two cents to make.

10:31.864 --> 10:34.633
Yeah, but you're not
factoring in your time

10:34.700 --> 10:36.335
and the cost of the
machine you bought

10:36.402 --> 10:37.970
and the value
of the brainpower it took

10:38.037 --> 10:39.839
to think of butterscotch
cotton candy.

10:39.905 --> 10:42.408
Yeah. No one else thought
of putting old-lady candy

10:42.475 --> 10:43.743
in a cotton candy machine.

10:43.809 --> 10:45.311
