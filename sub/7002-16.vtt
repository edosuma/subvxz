WEBVTT

00:11.443 --> 00:13.177
Yes, he's asleep.

00:13.178 --> 00:15.213
Are you sure
we should do this?

00:15.214 --> 00:18.016
<i>(whispering)</i> after what
he did to us last night
in that pillow fight?

00:18.017 --> 00:20.018
<i>(whispering)</i>
it's payback time!

00:20.019 --> 00:21.586
<i>(snoring)</i>

00:21.587 --> 00:24.789
Ok, mark, you do the shoes.
We'll take care of the rest.

00:34.867 --> 00:36.868
Everybody,

00:36.869 --> 00:38.803
Stand back.

00:39.939 --> 00:41.706
Ok.

00:46.445 --> 00:48.546
<i>(groans)</i>

00:54.854 --> 00:57.321
You little monkeys!

01:01.226 --> 01:03.028
Nice boxers, dad.

01:03.029 --> 01:05.096
Binford! Binford!
Binford!

01:05.096 --> 01:08.166
You watch that tabasco sauce.
I'm coming after you kids.

01:09.735 --> 01:13.471
Oh, honey, not now. Can't we
wait till after dinner?

01:15.340 --> 01:18.209
Those little genius boys
did this. Give me a towel
or something. Help me.

01:18.210 --> 01:20.378
No, wait, wait, wait. You're
just gonna make a big mess.

01:20.379 --> 01:21.746
Let me help you out
with that.
Come on!

01:21.747 --> 01:24.949
Ok, just a minute.
Say cheese!

02:36.455 --> 02:38.589
What do you think? Could we
put the kids in the middle?

02:43.162 --> 02:45.263
Good morning!
Morning, hon.

02:45.264 --> 02:48.633
What is green, has eight legs
and liver spots?

02:48.634 --> 02:51.702
I don't know,
but I think I married her.

02:53.305 --> 02:55.673
With all eight legs
kicking and screaming.

02:55.674 --> 02:58.943
So, tim, do you know
what special event

02:58.944 --> 03:00.779
We have coming up
next week?

03:00.780 --> 03:02.847
You don't even have to ask me.
I know what it is.

03:02.848 --> 03:04.115
You're bluffing.
What is it?

03:04.116 --> 03:05.950
Our anniversary.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

03:05.951 --> 03:10.789
Ok, mr. Big shot,
what day of the week is it?

03:10.790 --> 03:13.191
What day of the week
is it? That's easy.

03:13.192 --> 03:14.625
What day of the week
is it? What day...

03:14.626 --> 03:16.194
Friday.
Friday. Friday.

03:16.195 --> 03:18.997
Saturday. Saturday.
Saturday?

03:21.400 --> 03:24.468
We will, of course,
be exchanging gifts.

03:24.469 --> 03:26.971
And you're the hardest person
in the world to buy for.

03:26.972 --> 03:30.275
Yes, I know, I know.
But this year, I've made it
easy for you.

03:30.276 --> 03:33.812
Crowley's is holding
this beautiful gold
hand-knit sweater for me.

03:33.813 --> 03:35.746
All you have to do
is go down there
and pick it up,

03:35.747 --> 03:38.016
And your anniversary
nightmare is over.

03:38.017 --> 03:41.352
You just waltz in here
and deny me the pleasure
of shopping for you?

03:41.353 --> 03:42.553
That's right.

03:42.554 --> 03:45.489
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
All right.

03:45.490 --> 03:48.026
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Don't you want to know
what I want?

03:48.027 --> 03:50.161
I've already got your present,
and I know you'll love it.

03:50.162 --> 03:52.130
I hope it's as good as
the sweater I bought for you.

03:52.131 --> 03:55.499
I shopped for hours
for that thing.

03:55.500 --> 03:58.502
Want us to tell you
what mom got you?

03:58.503 --> 04:01.739
No, I don't want you
to tell me what mom got me.

04:01.740 --> 04:05.243
The surprise
is half the fun.

04:05.244 --> 04:08.813
I want to know,
and I want to know right now.

04:08.814 --> 04:12.483
Oh, well, you know, I don't
want to ruin the surprise.

04:12.484 --> 04:15.019
Mark, two bucks?
Broom closet. Top shelf.

04:15.020 --> 04:17.221
All right.

04:17.223 --> 04:20.124
Hey, I didn't know there were
gonna be bribes involved.

04:20.125 --> 04:22.827
Where have you been living
the last ten years?

04:24.629 --> 04:26.597
Oh, whoa!

04:28.567 --> 04:31.135
This is
like a momo steering wheel
off some kind of sports car.

04:31.136 --> 04:33.004
Yeah,
mario andretti's racecar.

04:33.005 --> 04:35.639
Get out of here!
Oh-oh-oh!

04:35.640 --> 04:38.409
Are you kidding? This is great.
How did she get this?

04:38.410 --> 04:41.312
Well, she wrote him a letter
after he was on your show.

04:41.313 --> 04:42.813
Oh, man.

04:42.814 --> 04:46.184
This thing is really cool.

04:46.185 --> 04:49.553
I gotta get her
something great.

04:49.554 --> 04:52.590
Something she really wants.

04:52.591 --> 04:54.993
Ballroom dancing lessons.

04:54.994 --> 04:58.096
Dad, be serious.
You don't know
how to dance.

05:00.599 --> 05:03.034
Brad! The bus is gonna
be here any minute.

05:03.035 --> 05:06.004
You still have to make your bed
and brush your teeth.

05:06.005 --> 05:09.107
Tim, you know, crowley's
is only gonna hold that sweater
for three days,

05:09.108 --> 05:11.109
So if you're gonna get it,
you gotta go fast.

05:11.110 --> 05:13.077
Forget about the sweater.
I've got the perfect gift
for you.

05:13.078 --> 05:15.413
If you think filling my car
with antifreeze

05:15.414 --> 05:18.783
Is gonna work as
my present again this year,
you can forget it.

05:18.784 --> 05:21.552
Let's put it this way -
when you find out what
I'm gonna give you,

05:21.553 --> 05:23.821
You're gonna want to cover me
in chocolate syrup

05:23.822 --> 05:27.392
And show your appreciation
in weird and unusual ways.

05:27.393 --> 05:30.194
Chocolate syrup.

05:30.195 --> 05:32.797
I've gotta admit,
you piqued my interest.

05:32.798 --> 05:35.566
What do you say to me
after we finish dinner
every anniversary?

05:35.567 --> 05:37.802
"tim, you have
mashed potatoes
on your tie."

05:37.803 --> 05:39.703
Jill, you always say,
"we should go dancing."

05:39.704 --> 05:43.241
This year, we go dancing.

05:43.242 --> 05:45.009
Are you serious?
Yeah.

05:45.010 --> 05:47.845
Oh, that's wonderful.

05:47.846 --> 05:49.880
Dining and dancing
at the excalibur.

05:49.881 --> 05:53.418
The excalibur! Yay!
That's fantastic!

05:53.419 --> 05:56.821
And in order
to prepare ourselves
for a night of ecstasy...

05:56.822 --> 05:57.888
Yeah?

05:57.889 --> 06:00.024
...I say we take

06:00.025 --> 06:02.193
Ballroom dancing lessons.

06:02.194 --> 06:07.031
Ballroom dancing lessons.
Oh, honey...

06:07.032 --> 06:09.067
I just have two words
for you.
Yeah?

06:09.068 --> 06:11.635
Hot fudge.
Oh. Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh.

06:13.138 --> 06:15.406
<i>(♪ ballroom)</i>

06:18.643 --> 06:22.447
There you go, cha-cha-cha.
Move those hips, cha-cha-cha.

06:22.448 --> 06:26.517
Very good, mr. Green.
Very nice, mrs. T.

06:26.518 --> 06:28.052
Thank you.
Good.

06:28.053 --> 06:29.988
This is
really embarrassing.

06:29.989 --> 06:33.091
Well, you weren't
embarrassed in the '70s
when you had to do disco.

06:33.092 --> 06:35.460
Well, I had white boots,
you know?

06:37.396 --> 06:38.762
Cha-cha, cha-cha-cha.

06:38.763 --> 06:41.966
Yeah, that was
embarrassing.
This cha-cha's so dated.

06:41.967 --> 06:45.203
Oh, yeah, like disco
is here to stay.
Could be.

06:45.204 --> 06:48.039
Ok, class, that was
just wonderful.

06:48.040 --> 06:51.942
Mrs. Taylor, really,
you're a natural.
Such style and grace.

06:51.943 --> 06:54.112
Oh, thank you.
How about me?

06:54.113 --> 06:58.149
Well, mr. Taylor,
you're one of a kind.

06:58.150 --> 07:00.584
Thanks a lot.
What did she mean by that?

07:00.585 --> 07:03.521
She meant you're a geek,
and disco is dead.

07:05.590 --> 07:08.493
All right, everybody,
let's take a break,
but remember -

07:08.494 --> 07:12.530
To live is to dance,
and to dance is to be free.

07:12.531 --> 07:15.799
Free? Does this mean
you're not charging us
20 bucks for the lesson?

07:15.800 --> 07:18.769
Oh, mr. Taylor,
don't think of it as money.

07:18.770 --> 07:21.972
Think of it as an investment
in sophistication.

07:21.973 --> 07:25.510
And that's an investment
you could use.

07:25.511 --> 07:27.912
Tim, come on.
This dance-class thing
was your idea.

07:27.913 --> 07:30.181
Are you just gonna
fool around all the time?
No, I'm not gonna fool around.

07:30.182 --> 07:32.883
I'm gonna get this
and learn how to cha-cha.

07:32.884 --> 07:35.186
I can't fool around with
all these refined people
in here.

07:35.187 --> 07:38.122
Hey, tool man,
I love your show.

07:38.123 --> 07:40.291
<i>(grunts)</i>
<i>(tim grunts in reply)</i>

07:40.292 --> 07:43.661
You must be mrs. Arr-arr.

07:43.662 --> 07:45.663
Well, actually,

07:45.664 --> 07:47.498
Arr-arr-arr
is my married name.

07:47.499 --> 07:50.101
My maiden name was...
<i>(high-pitched barking)</i>

07:56.308 --> 07:58.309
Will you excuse me?
I have to go check
our babysitter

07:58.310 --> 08:01.279
And see if our kids
have killed him yet.

08:01.280 --> 08:03.281
Andy paxton.
Hey, andy. Tim taylor.

08:03.282 --> 08:05.550
Sit down, buddy.
How are you?

08:05.551 --> 08:08.586
So, uh, how did your wife
rope you into this
cha-cha thing?

08:08.587 --> 08:10.421
Well, it's a trade-off.

08:10.422 --> 08:13.357
You see, I do the cha-cha,
she shaves.

08:15.160 --> 08:18.329
All right, everybody.
The break's over.

08:18.330 --> 08:20.698
The line was busy.

08:20.699 --> 08:23.134
Now that you know
the basic cha-cha,

08:23.135 --> 08:24.902
Let's add a little spice.

08:24.903 --> 08:27.305
I need a couple
to demonstrate.

08:27.306 --> 08:29.474
Mrs. Taylor.

08:29.475 --> 08:31.642
No, no, mr. Taylor,
not you.

08:31.643 --> 08:34.312
I think we'll just kinda
mix things up a little bit.

08:34.313 --> 08:36.080
Mr. Green,

08:36.081 --> 08:40.683
I think you'll complement
mrs. Taylor very nicely.

08:40.684 --> 08:44.355
I bet he knows nothing
about belt sanders.

08:44.356 --> 08:47.758
All right, everybody,
we're gonna be adding
a few turns.

08:47.759 --> 08:50.228
Now, mrs. Taylor,
watch closely.

08:58.837 --> 09:02.440
I'd like to
see the guy try that
on a construction site.

09:04.109 --> 09:06.377
Now, this is what I call
the keeney flair.

09:10.682 --> 09:13.584
Well...

09:13.585 --> 09:17.087
I sometimes
get carried away.

09:17.088 --> 09:18.722
Now, mrs. Taylor, you try.

09:18.723 --> 09:20.491
Oh, I didn't get
that last part.

09:20.492 --> 09:22.726
Oh, well, try.

09:22.727 --> 09:24.695
Here we go.

09:27.932 --> 09:29.967
Loosen up, mrs. Taylor.

09:29.968 --> 09:33.604
Keep your eyes locked
on your partner.

09:33.605 --> 09:36.774
Foreheads together.

09:36.775 --> 09:40.378
This is what I call
the love focus.

09:42.247 --> 09:43.914
I can't believe
I paid 20 bucks

09:43.915 --> 09:45.916
To have some other guy
dance with my wife.

09:45.917 --> 09:48.052
Hey, I'd pay him 30
to dance with my wife.

09:48.053 --> 09:50.788
Let him get
the razor burns.

09:52.224 --> 09:55.826
Mr. Green, more flair,
more panache.

10:00.965 --> 10:02.099
What are you doing?

10:02.100 --> 10:04.202
Flairing, panaching!
Well, stop it.

10:05.737 --> 10:07.405
Mr. Taylor.

10:07.406 --> 10:09.473
Mr. Taylor, would you
come out here, please?

10:09.474 --> 10:11.475
Me?
Yes.

10:11.476 --> 10:14.245
You seem to be
enjoying yourself.
Totally, babe.

10:14.246 --> 10:15.646
Well, why don't we put-

10:15.647 --> 10:19.917
Why don't we put
all of our creative energies
to good use?

10:19.918 --> 10:23.153
And refinish the floor.

10:23.154 --> 10:25.523
No. Let's use
our imagination.
All right.

10:25.524 --> 10:26.724
We're in new york.

10:26.725 --> 10:28.593
Give me your wallet.

10:33.898 --> 10:38.068
We're in the stork club, 1957.

10:38.069 --> 10:41.105
<i>(♪ ballroom)</i>

10:41.106 --> 10:44.141
The band begins
to play a cha-cha,

10:44.142 --> 10:46.910
And we see each other
across the room.

10:46.911 --> 10:49.079
Our eyes lock.
Ah!

10:50.382 --> 10:54.385
The band begins to play
a dance of passion.

10:58.189 --> 11:01.959
Oh, the mating ritual
begins.
Lady, lady, lady.

11:01.960 --> 11:03.961
I've got a wife,
you know.

11:03.962 --> 11:07.164
In 1957, you had no wife.

11:07.165 --> 11:09.767
Now let yourself go,
mr. Taylor.

11:09.768 --> 11:11.736
Don't be a prisoner
of your body.

11:11.737 --> 11:14.171
Free me, warden.
I'm on parole!

11:14.172 --> 11:15.406
Let's show 'em.

11:15.407 --> 11:18.743
Let's show the class
those turns.

11:18.744 --> 11:21.345
Oh, with lots of speed

11:21.346 --> 11:23.381
And lots of flair.

11:23.382 --> 11:25.849
Oh, spin me, mr. Taylor!

11:25.850 --> 11:27.918
Really spin me!

11:30.021 --> 11:31.455
<i>(screaming)</i>

11:31.456 --> 11:33.758

11:44.770 --> 11:47.204
Mark, did you tie
his shoelaces together?

11:47.205 --> 11:49.273
He doesn't have any.

11:50.375 --> 11:52.310
Forget it.

11:59.785 --> 12:02.186
Put some
in his other hand.

12:22.106 --> 12:24.775
Oh, you thought
you'd get me, huh?

12:28.680 --> 12:31.782
I can't believe it.
This worked great on dad.

12:31.783 --> 12:34.151
I know. He told me.
<i>(door shuts)</i>

12:34.152 --> 12:36.420
Quick, quick.
Mom and dad are home.

12:36.421 --> 12:39.122
Run up...
Get ready for...

12:39.123 --> 12:41.592
Get ready for bed, quick!
All right. Wash your faces.

12:43.995 --> 12:46.864
Hi, al.
How were the kids?
Great, great.

12:46.865 --> 12:49.433
And how was the first
ballroom dancing class?

12:49.434 --> 12:50.634
It went pretty good.

12:50.635 --> 12:53.571
Oh, pretty good!
It was a disaster.

12:53.572 --> 12:57.007
He threw the teacher
across the room.

12:57.008 --> 12:58.075
You did?

12:58.076 --> 13:01.144
Not. She said,
"spin me. Spin me."

13:02.714 --> 13:04.715
You'd think a former
June taylor dancer

13:04.716 --> 13:07.150
Could take a fall
better than that.

13:07.151 --> 13:08.586
Well, she might have
been able to

13:08.587 --> 13:11.389
If she hadn't caught her chin
on the piano.

13:11.390 --> 13:15.726
Well, I'm still free
for tomorrow night
for lesson number two.

13:15.727 --> 13:18.829
I don't think so, al.

13:18.830 --> 13:21.565
After she regained
consciousness,

13:21.566 --> 13:25.503
Mrs. Keeney
gave our description
to the security guard.

13:25.504 --> 13:26.904
She was so woozy,

13:26.905 --> 13:29.740
She described us
as an elderly japanese couple.

13:31.710 --> 13:33.143
Well, if I leave right now,

13:33.144 --> 13:35.880
I can still make
second session of bingo.

13:35.881 --> 13:37.381
Thank you, al.
Ok.

13:37.382 --> 13:39.450
You don't want to miss that.
Hurry up, al, hurry.

13:39.451 --> 13:41.952
Bye-bye.
I'll see you
at work tomorrow.

13:41.953 --> 13:43.721
See you, buddy.

13:43.722 --> 13:45.456
There's other dance studios
we can go to, you know.

13:45.457 --> 13:46.924
You know,
you always do this.

13:46.925 --> 13:49.660
You always ridicule everything
that is important to me.

13:49.661 --> 13:51.328
No, I don't. I was just trying
to make your gift as special

13:51.329 --> 13:53.597
As the steer... Steer...
The steer. A steer.

13:53.598 --> 13:54.932
What a gift that would be.
A steer.

13:54.933 --> 13:56.767
You could have
a steer out there,

13:56.768 --> 13:59.703
Get beef and milk
out of the same animal.

14:01.339 --> 14:03.507
You snooped.
I did not.

14:03.508 --> 14:05.709
You snooped around
and found the steering wheel.

14:05.710 --> 14:07.745
It's
not like you hid it very well.
You put it in the broom closet.

14:07.746 --> 14:09.747
When was the last time
you used the broom?

14:09.748 --> 14:12.516
Thank you for ruining
both gifts.

14:12.517 --> 14:14.618
I love the steering wheel.

14:14.619 --> 14:17.154
Exactly, which is why
I would have liked to
have seen you open it.

14:17.155 --> 14:19.256
We can still go dancing
Saturday at excalibur.

14:19.257 --> 14:20.925
No way I'm gonna go
dancing with a man

14:20.926 --> 14:22.860
Who can't even make it
through one lesson.

14:22.861 --> 14:26.129
Yeah, but give me credit.
The ballroom-dancing idea
was good.

14:26.130 --> 14:28.499
Oh, I bet that wasn't even
your idea. I bet the kids
thought of it, right?

14:28.500 --> 14:30.033
No. The amount you've been
nagging me about -

14:30.034 --> 14:31.268
"nag" is the wrong word.

14:31.269 --> 14:33.737
"nag" is the wrong word.
It's the wrong word!

14:33.738 --> 14:36.206
I can dance. I've got flair.

14:36.207 --> 14:38.542
I've got panache,
just like mr. Green.

14:42.614 --> 14:45.248
And the binford power roofing
nail gun is my favorite,

14:45.249 --> 14:48.986
Because the new magazine
holds 120 roofing nails.

14:48.987 --> 14:51.455
It's enough for
a bushel of shingles.

14:51.456 --> 14:53.390
<i>(nail fires)</i>
<i>(man)</i> oh!

14:55.393 --> 14:59.062
Available at fine
hardware stores everywhere.

14:59.063 --> 15:00.931
Mark, get a claw hammer,
get that out of your thigh.

15:00.932 --> 15:03.801
Get some salve on it.
<i>(al)</i> tim.

15:03.802 --> 15:06.036
And if it doesn't
say binford on it,

15:06.037 --> 15:08.005
Somebody else makes it.

15:14.045 --> 15:16.113
Time now
for our next project.

15:16.114 --> 15:19.049
All right, before we
get to our next project,
we have a special guest.

15:19.050 --> 15:21.385
Jerry hobert's here
from the village association

15:21.386 --> 15:24.421
To give me a certificate
of appreciation.

15:24.422 --> 15:27.324
You?
Is there an echo
in here? Yes, me.

15:27.325 --> 15:30.027
Let's bring jerry out here
with a big <i>tool time</i> welcome.
Jerry hobert, everybody.

15:35.199 --> 15:37.801
It's good to see you, tim.
You know, I've never been
on tv before.

15:37.802 --> 15:39.302
Oh, anybody can do it.

15:39.303 --> 15:41.505
You should know.

15:41.506 --> 15:45.442
Well, tim, on behalf
of the detroit area
homebuilders association,

15:45.443 --> 15:48.111
I would like to present you
with this beautiful scroll.

15:48.112 --> 15:50.113
Now, al's name's
on there, right?

15:50.114 --> 15:51.181
No, it's not.

15:51.182 --> 15:53.417
Oh. It's too bad, huh?

15:55.420 --> 15:58.856
Well, read it with
a loud, clear voice
for us.

16:00.892 --> 16:04.261
<i>(very loudly)</i> we award
this certificate

16:04.262 --> 16:07.097
To tim taylor
for his efforts

16:07.098 --> 16:10.668
To promote safety at home
and on the job.

16:10.669 --> 16:13.403
You're getting an award
for safety?

16:16.575 --> 16:19.610
Yeah, I am, flannel boy.
You got a problem with that?

16:19.611 --> 16:21.311
Well, I guess
they didn't see the show

16:21.312 --> 16:22.980
Where you
fell through the roof
of the project house.

16:22.981 --> 16:25.382
Maybe they didn't, al.

16:25.383 --> 16:27.451
Or the time you glued
your head to the table.
Al!

16:27.452 --> 16:29.386
Or the time
when you stapled the...
Jerry...

16:30.722 --> 16:32.890
Jerry, continue.

16:32.891 --> 16:37.227
Your clever staging
of realistic-looking accidents

16:37.228 --> 16:41.298
Clearly shows viewers
what not to do.

16:41.299 --> 16:43.200
We salute you.

16:43.201 --> 16:44.301
Oh... <i>(grunts)</i>

16:53.244 --> 16:55.646
Hey, wilson.
Hi-ho, neighbor.

16:57.916 --> 17:00.484
Got one for you.
Mm-hmm.

17:00.485 --> 17:02.385
How much wood
could a wilson chop

17:02.386 --> 17:05.021
If a wilson
could chop wood?

17:05.022 --> 17:06.924
He could cut a quarter
of a cord of conifer

17:06.925 --> 17:10.426
If you gave him a quarter
for every cord he cut.

17:12.563 --> 17:14.632
You're good.

17:14.633 --> 17:17.601
Uh-huh. By the way,
happy anniversary.

17:17.602 --> 17:20.303
Uh... Not from
jill's point of view.

17:20.304 --> 17:21.872
Problem, tim?

17:21.873 --> 17:24.675
The problem is I can't dance.

17:24.675 --> 17:26.609
I won't ask you.

17:28.445 --> 17:29.913
I got jill kinda angry with me

17:29.914 --> 17:33.250
'cause I was goofing around
at this dance class we took.

17:33.251 --> 17:37.354
Well, tim, oftentimes, we mock
that which we cannot do.

17:37.355 --> 17:40.124
I can't cha-cha. I was
trying to figure out

17:40.125 --> 17:42.626
Where to put
my hands and my feet
and line everything up,

17:42.627 --> 17:44.294
And the next thing I know,

17:44.295 --> 17:48.065
The instructor
slides under a piano,
and her jaw is wired shut.

17:48.066 --> 17:50.768
Hmm, I don't know that step.

17:50.769 --> 17:53.303
She didn't, either.

17:53.304 --> 17:56.273
Whoa.

17:56.274 --> 17:59.843
Well, tim, the problem is,
you're just thinking too much.

17:59.844 --> 18:03.513
Let's say you were
a racecar driver...
Oh.

18:03.514 --> 18:05.049
...And you're taking
your turns at indy.

18:05.050 --> 18:08.752
Indy, aahh!

18:08.753 --> 18:10.954
Passing unser.
See you, buddy. Sucker!

18:10.955 --> 18:12.690
Aah!

18:12.691 --> 18:14.091
Ah, tim,
you're doing quite well.

18:14.092 --> 18:15.592
Finish line's right up there,
checkered flag.

18:15.593 --> 18:17.527
Don't look in the mirror.
Aahh! Mirrors?

18:17.528 --> 18:19.596
Forget about the minicam.
Minicam's right back here.

18:19.597 --> 18:21.398
Don't wave at the...
Aah!

18:21.399 --> 18:24.367
Oh!
Uh-oh. You hit the wall.

18:24.368 --> 18:26.203
<i>(makes car-passing noises)</i>

18:26.204 --> 18:29.239
They're all passing me.
I was so close to it.

18:29.240 --> 18:30.774
Well, tim, you were doing fine
when you weren't thinking

18:30.775 --> 18:33.744
About the minicam
or the mirrors and such.

18:33.745 --> 18:36.613
You were going on instinct.
You were one with the car.

18:36.614 --> 18:38.048
You were zen-like.

18:38.049 --> 18:40.450
I was zen-like.
Mm-hmm.

18:40.451 --> 18:43.954
I never met zen.
What was he like?

18:43.955 --> 18:46.356
No, no, no, tim.
Zen is a state of mind.

18:46.357 --> 18:48.125
Like when you dance,
you can't worry about

18:48.126 --> 18:50.060
What your hands
and your feet are doing.

18:50.061 --> 18:53.731
You just have to let
the music envelop you.
That's what I do.

18:53.732 --> 18:55.999
Right, left, cha-cha-cha.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.301
Left, right, cha-cha-cha.

18:58.302 --> 19:00.270
Right, left, cha-cha-cha.

19:00.271 --> 19:02.472
Left, right, cha-cha-cha.

19:02.473 --> 19:04.507
Work with me, tim.

19:04.508 --> 19:06.443
Right, left, cha-cha-cha.

19:06.444 --> 19:08.445
Right, left, cha-cha-cha.

19:08.446 --> 19:10.480
One, two, three, cha-cha-cha.
I think I got it, I got it.

19:10.481 --> 19:13.383
All right, tim.
We're gonna do a turn.
Let yourself go.

19:13.384 --> 19:15.719
Right, left, cha-cha-cha.

19:15.720 --> 19:18.321
Left, right, cha-cha-cha.

19:18.322 --> 19:20.457
Wilson, I think...
I think I got it!

19:22.961 --> 19:24.561
Come on, jill, hurry up.
Are you still mad?

19:24.562 --> 19:26.897
Are you going
to dinner with me?

19:26.898 --> 19:29.266
Yes, of course
I'm going to dinner
with you. I'm not mad.

19:29.267 --> 19:31.969
8:00 reservations. We still
have to exchange gifts.

19:31.970 --> 19:33.971
How about,
"you look pretty"?

19:33.972 --> 19:36.140
Thanks. I changed my hair.

19:36.141 --> 19:38.742
I'm using that
raspberry mousse of yours.
It's very fragrant.

19:38.743 --> 19:42.512
Where's my gift?
Close your eyes.
Shut your mouth.

19:42.513 --> 19:47.284
Now, I just know you're gonna
be so surprised about this.

19:47.285 --> 19:49.153
Ta-da!
Oh!

19:49.154 --> 19:52.122
This is great.
This is great.

19:52.123 --> 19:53.556
Oh, wow!

19:53.557 --> 19:58.361
What a pretty sweater.
You have such good taste.

19:58.362 --> 20:00.197
Happy anniversary.
Happy anniversary.

20:00.198 --> 20:02.266
I love you, and I
love this, and thanks
for thinking about me.

20:02.267 --> 20:05.068
I love you.

20:05.069 --> 20:07.070
Well, enough of that. Ok.

20:07.071 --> 20:09.306
Now, did you give al
enough money

20:09.307 --> 20:11.408
To get the kids popcorn
at the movies?

20:11.409 --> 20:15.478
Yeah. He wanted some extra
for milk duds for himself.

20:15.479 --> 20:17.314
Did you give him
the number at chez pierre?

20:17.315 --> 20:19.149
We're not going to chez pierre.
We're going to the excalibur.

20:19.150 --> 20:22.352
Oh, honey, you were
supposed to cancel
those reservations.

20:22.353 --> 20:24.822
That's when you
didn't like dancing with me.

20:24.823 --> 20:26.123
I don't want to hurt
your feelings,

20:26.124 --> 20:28.192
But I still don't
want to dance with you.

20:28.193 --> 20:31.295
I'd hold that opinion
if I were you.

20:31.296 --> 20:33.697
<i>(♪ ballroom)</i>

20:43.908 --> 20:46.210
What is this?

20:53.084 --> 20:55.518
<i>(laughs)</i>

20:55.519 --> 20:57.687
Whoa!

20:59.891 --> 21:01.992
Wow!

21:01.993 --> 21:05.128
What happened? Two days ago,
all you could do was disco.

21:05.129 --> 21:07.164
I met a man named zen.

21:07.165 --> 21:09.466
If you think
you can keep up,
please join in.

21:09.467 --> 21:11.335
Ok.

21:18.509 --> 21:20.277
Huh.

21:25.649 --> 21:27.751
<i>(grunts)</i>

21:29.820 --> 21:31.821
Shall we do the momo step?
Do the momo step.

21:34.725 --> 21:36.894
You like this thing,
don't you?
I love this thing.

21:36.895 --> 21:40.197
I bought it on your
cha-cha-charge account.

21:41.832 --> 21:43.934
<i>(makes car noise)</i>

21:46.271 --> 21:49.006
Try to picture yourself...
1993.

21:49.007 --> 21:51.741
It's the motor city.

21:51.742 --> 21:55.645
We lock eyes across
a huge hardware store.

22:04.722 --> 22:06.823
The love focus.

22:21.072 --> 22:22.739
So...

22:22.740 --> 22:24.341
Honey...

22:24.342 --> 22:27.510
You were so amazing
last night.

22:27.511 --> 22:29.446
On the dance floor.
On the dance floor?

22:31.382 --> 22:34.517
I especially liked this
tablecloth thing you did.

22:34.518 --> 22:37.620
That was cool, wasn't it?
Yes. It was so sexy
when you...

22:44.562 --> 22:46.830
How did you do that?

22:50.034 --> 22:51.501
<i>(jill)</i> brad! The bus is here,

22:51.502 --> 22:54.371
And you still have, uh,
to brush your teeth, and, um...

22:54.372 --> 22:56.673
And, uh...

22:56.674 --> 22:58.775
<i>(laughter)</i>

23:01.346 --> 23:04.381
Ooh. The wheels fell off
of that one real quick.

23:04.382 --> 23:05.949
Once you find out
what I've bought you,

23:05.950 --> 23:07.985
You're gonna want to fill
my head with cannonballs

23:07.986 --> 23:09.619
And powder my behind.

23:18.162 --> 23:20.464
<i>(jill)</i> could you
say that again?

23:25.236 --> 23:26.403
I'm ok.
