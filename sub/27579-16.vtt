You are concerned for her?

06:04.497 --> 06:05.832

06:05.866 --> 06:07.768
She's a newly

-No.

that inhibitor collar.

I suppose it gave her
the illusion of control.

there was some

12:40.360 --> 12:41.928
brought them onto the team,

12:41.962 --> 12:44.197
worked with them as Tigress.

12:44.231 --> 12:46.333
You're back with the team?

12:46.366 --> 12:48.135
You're Tigress again?

What I've always done!

13:03.049 --> 13:04.418
Not always.

13:04.451 --> 13:07.187
You left the life behind,
then came back to it

13:07.220 --> 13:09.055
at a cost that nearly
destroyed you.

-Don't.
-Two years recovering,

at a normal life.

13:17.564 --> 13:21.235

your master's degree,
and then your doctorate.

-Look at me, Artemis!

You don't have to fight crime

is your sister
