WEBVTT

00:04.108 --> 00:06.446
This week, we gave you a
taste of the high life--couture
clothing and a private jet.

00:06.446 --> 00:10.622
Man:
Jason Derulo!

00:10.622 --> 00:12.425
What's up, ladies?
( bleep ) rock star.

00:12.425 --> 00:15.130
- Yes! Fabulous.
- Right there.

00:15.130 --> 00:16.967
Tatiana:
<i>I am a boss,
and I am strong,</i>

00:16.967 --> 00:19.005
<i>so I just did
what I do best.</i>

00:19.005 --> 00:20.508
Come on, Courtney.
One leg is two steps up.

00:20.508 --> 00:22.111
Give me a lot of--
Binta lean away from him.

00:22.111 --> 00:25.183
It's almost boredom.

00:25.183 --> 00:27.054
Rita:
You two models were
the girls to beat.

00:27.054 --> 00:29.058
Courtney, congratulations.
I'm so sorry, Binta.

01:20.829 --> 01:23.867
Courtney: <i>The judges
were very harsh.</i>

01:24.703 --> 01:26.941
I feel so bad for Binta.

01:26.941 --> 01:28.611
I feel bad,
but I never feel "bad" bad,
because I want to win.

01:28.611 --> 01:31.617
I'm super excited
I got best photo.

01:31.617 --> 01:33.286
<i>I feel like people
are starting to see me</i>

01:33.286 --> 01:35.257
<i>more and more
as competition</i>

01:35.257 --> 01:36.861
I'm already a boss.
I already have a business,

01:36.861 --> 01:38.697
I'm already really clear
on my brand.

01:38.697 --> 01:40.200
Getting best photo
and thriving in photo shoots,

01:40.200 --> 01:42.405
that's just the next step.

01:42.405 --> 01:43.941
I was looking
at Court and Binta

01:43.941 --> 01:46.445
and I was like,
"Oh, my God."

01:46.445 --> 01:48.918
'Cause standing
from the sidelines

01:48.918 --> 01:50.253
it doesn't look like
it's that intense.

01:50.253 --> 01:51.590
But when you're
standing there--

01:51.590 --> 01:53.459
I was literally shaking.

01:53.459 --> 01:55.463
Oh, my gosh, I'm pretty
shaken up right now.

01:55.463 --> 01:59.204
It was my first time
being in the bottom two.

01:59.204 --> 02:01.476
<i>Those judges ripped me
to shreds today.</i>

02:01.476 --> 02:04.583
No! I thought we weren't
complaining anymore!

02:04.583 --> 02:07.956
Between the complaints
and the babying,

02:07.956 --> 02:10.326
count yourself out.

02:10.326 --> 02:12.164
I need to prove myself
this week.

02:12.164 --> 02:14.503
I think that now
that the numbers are smaller,

02:14.503 --> 02:16.439
you can't just be
a pretty face.

02:16.439 --> 02:17.140
Yeah.

02:17.942 --> 02:18.577
Hi! What's up?

02:21.883 --> 02:26.159
All: Hi.

02:26.159 --> 02:27.762
We are more than halfway
through the competition.

02:27.762 --> 02:30.234
A few weeks ago,
you all learned choreography.

02:30.234 --> 02:33.507
Today we are taking it
all the way up.

02:33.507 --> 02:37.181
We're creating a full
music fashion video this week.

02:37.181 --> 02:41.189
Marissa:
The last dance routine
that we had to learn

02:41.189 --> 02:44.428
I kind of went a little
buckwild on Stacy.

02:44.428 --> 02:46.533
You're not giving me notes.
You're just making me do
the same thing over and over.

02:46.533 --> 02:48.938
I'm not making you do
the same thing over and over.

02:48.938 --> 02:50.340
You're doing the same
thing over and over.

02:50.340 --> 02:52.077
I know, that's why
I want you to help me.

02:52.077 --> 02:53.447
I understand that you have
to have the full package,

02:53.447 --> 02:55.450
<i>but I didn't
come here to dance.</i>

02:55.450 --> 02:57.689
You're going to be
part of an ensemble.

02:57.689 --> 02:59.425
And, ladies, working with
someone else in a video
is hard. Trust me.

02:59.425 --> 03:03.333
Since there's only seven
of you left, I thought,

03:03.333 --> 03:06.506
you know, we could use
some more models.

03:19.900 --> 03:24.274
I'm back, bitches!

03:24.274 --> 03:26.112
You remember Binta, Krislian,

03:26.112 --> 03:28.718
Giah, Kyle, Tash,

03:28.718 --> 03:31.556
Cherish, and Justine.

03:31.556 --> 03:33.359
I was the first girl
eliminated.

03:33.359 --> 03:35.464
Do you know
how young you are?

03:35.464 --> 03:37.569
You have so much time.
This isn't the end.

03:37.569 --> 03:41.075
I want to prove
that I'm more mature

03:41.075 --> 03:44.081
than the first time
I was here.

03:44.081 --> 03:46.553
Kyle:
<i>It's good to see Marissa.</i>

03:46.553 --> 03:48.223
<i>I definitely missed her
while we were apart.</i>

03:48.223 --> 03:49.425
However, I know
I distracted her a little bit

03:49.425 --> 03:51.597
before I left
the competition,

03:51.597 --> 03:53.768
so I don't wanna step
on her toes.

03:53.768 --> 03:56.239
Rita:
These seven models
are moving back

03:56.239 --> 03:59.044
into your house
for the rest of the week.

03:59.044 --> 04:00.648
Holy ( bleep ).
This is so dumb.

04:03.186 --> 04:05.824
That's how this cookie
crumbles my friends.

04:05.824 --> 04:08.196
Cody:
I love my sister,
but since she's been gone

04:08.196 --> 04:10.935
I feel like I'm a much
more confident model.

04:10.935 --> 04:12.939
<i>I don't want her back
in the house</i>

04:12.939 --> 04:14.842
because then I'm just back
into that little sister mode.

04:14.842 --> 04:17.949
Based on how well you do,
one of you will be going home,

04:17.949 --> 04:22.458
and one of these girls
will be taking your place.

04:22.458 --> 04:25.130
Giah:
The girls are all
smiling and stuff.

04:25.130 --> 04:27.736
Like, it's
fake, obviously.

04:27.736 --> 04:29.940
<i>We just like, unh-uh.
Unh-uh, honey.</i>

04:29.940 --> 04:31.611
<i>You know you scared
to see us.</i>

04:31.611 --> 04:35.083
To help us out today,

04:35.083 --> 04:36.553
I brought in
the amazing choreographer

04:36.553 --> 04:40.260
<i>behind Drake's
"Hotline Bling" video,</i>

04:40.260 --> 04:42.532
<i>behind Rhianna's videos.</i>

04:42.532 --> 04:44.301
Meet the gorgeous
Tanisha Scott.

04:46.606 --> 04:46.907
Tash:
<i>Tanisha, I see her
in videos all the time.</i>

04:50.915 --> 04:54.489
I've stolen
moves from her.

04:54.489 --> 04:56.326
I'm just learning from
the best of the best.

04:56.326 --> 04:58.396
So, I'm a choreographer,
but I also work
with models a lot,

04:58.396 --> 05:02.004
on commercials,
music videos.

05:02.004 --> 05:03.975
You don't have to be
the best dancer per say,

05:03.975 --> 05:07.381
but you have to be
the best performer.

05:07.381 --> 05:10.120
You have to make me
believe that you are a dancer.

05:10.120 --> 05:12.558
I need to feel that
with you ladies, okay?

05:12.558 --> 05:15.496
I won the last video shoot
where we had to dance.

05:15.496 --> 05:17.735
<i>It wasn't easy choreography,
but I love to dance.</i>

05:17.735 --> 05:20.608
So I think I'm in good shape
for this one.

05:20.608 --> 05:22.645
Tanisha:
I'm gonna have
my assistant Nefatari

05:22.645 --> 05:24.315
show you what
the routine looks like.

05:24.315 --> 05:25.918
Ready?

05:37.976 --> 05:42.585
So within it you see
that there's poses,

05:42.585 --> 05:44.021
but in the poses,
you've still gotta move.

05:44.021 --> 05:46.827
I want this spot so bad.

05:46.827 --> 05:48.530
When the said I had peaked
already in the competition...

05:48.530 --> 05:51.368
We're concerned that
you've reached your peak.

05:51.368 --> 05:54.308
Hopefully, with my dance,
they'll see that I am talented

05:54.308 --> 05:56.680
and I'm a hard worker.
This is like my redemption.

05:56.680 --> 05:58.884
I'm gonna put you guys
into your squad groups--

05:58.884 --> 06:02.558
Squad A and Squad B.

06:02.558 --> 06:04.161
Paige:
We're doing sort of, like,
a dance-off challenge.

06:04.161 --> 06:07.301
It's essentially, Squad A,

06:07.301 --> 06:08.704
which are the girls
who are in the house

06:08.704 --> 06:10.040
versus Squad B, who are
the eliminated girls.

06:10.040 --> 06:13.046
You're going to be competing

06:13.046 --> 06:14.048
for the starring role
of each of your squads.

06:14.048 --> 06:19.225
Boom. Boom.

06:19.225 --> 06:20.561
So that means, you not only
have to work as a team,

06:20.561 --> 06:22.699
you've gotta stand out
on your own.

06:22.699 --> 06:24.836
Five, six, seven, eight.

06:24.836 --> 06:28.476
Tanisha:
To be a true boss
in this industry,

06:28.476 --> 06:31.583
you can't just
see yourself as a model.

06:31.583 --> 06:34.054
I want to know
who the baddest bitch
is in here.

06:34.054 --> 06:35.925
<i>You have to be a dancer,
you have to be a singer,</i>

06:35.925 --> 06:37.394
you have to be a part
of everything.

06:37.394 --> 06:39.431
We got, one, two,
three, and four!

06:39.431 --> 06:41.970
Get it together.
We've still got
a lot to learn.

06:41.970 --> 06:43.707
I'm gonna keep moving it

06:43.707 --> 06:44.976
and if you don't
get this part,

06:44.976 --> 06:46.814
then you're gonna be
lost in the sauce.

06:46.814 --> 06:48.651
Tash:
<i>Being eliminated,
I lost my spark.</i>

06:48.651 --> 06:51.088
And I kind of felt like
maybe this isn't my thing.

06:51.088 --> 06:54.228
I don't love it.
I think it's a little basic.

06:54.228 --> 06:57.267
I don't like
anything about it.
Everything looks cheap.

06:57.267 --> 06:59.104
<i>This is definitely
the time to fight.</i>

06:59.104 --> 07:01.408
<i>I'm a natural born leader</i>

07:01.408 --> 07:02.579
and I think that's really
going to shine through.

07:02.579 --> 07:04.381
Five, six, seven, eight.

07:04.381 --> 07:07.053
You got, one, two,
three, and four.

07:07.053 --> 07:10.127
Get it together
if you really want this.

07:10.127 --> 07:12.298
Marissa:
Honestly, I'm staying as far
away from Kyle as possible.

07:12.298 --> 07:14.402
You're doing it wrong.
It's over your face.

07:14.402 --> 07:16.607
I did ( bleep ) on the
first dance challenge.

07:16.607 --> 07:18.443
<i>I'm doing ( bleep )
on this one,</i>

07:18.443 --> 07:20.246
and I don't want to
be distracted.

07:20.246 --> 07:21.783
Again, again, again.
Come on, come on.

07:21.783 --> 07:23.420
I don't care
if the move is wrong,
you can't look lost.

07:23.420 --> 07:26.392
I'm gonna watch someone
do it right now.

07:26.392 --> 07:28.462
I'm gonna watch y'all do
the whole ( bleep ) thing.

07:28.462 --> 07:30.433
I don't know the counts.
I don't know steps.

07:30.433 --> 07:31.904
<i>Courtney has a goddamn
pole in her back</i>

07:31.904 --> 07:33.305
and she's doing better
than me.

07:33.305 --> 07:34.609
That's some ( bleep ) up
( bleep ).

07:34.609 --> 07:36.479
That's whack.

07:36.479 --> 07:37.716
I'm not a ( bleep )
dancer. Like, what the ( bleep
).

07:37.716 --> 07:39.217
( bleep ) annoying.

07:41.322 --> 07:42.825
Courtney:
<i>Marissa got flustered</i>

07:42.825 --> 07:44.996
<i>and, like, walked away.</i>

07:44.996 --> 07:46.834
It was very
unprofessional.

07:46.834 --> 07:48.403
<i>Here I am giving it 110%</i>

07:48.403 --> 07:50.608
because I want to be here
no matter what.

07:50.608 --> 07:53.313
( sobbing )

07:53.313 --> 07:55.918
I'm over this challenge
and the thought of that

07:55.918 --> 07:59.091
being the determining factor
on whether I stay or leave?

07:59.091 --> 08:01.495
Like, what the ( bleep )?
I came here to model,

08:01.495 --> 08:04.101
not to be a ( bleep )
back up dancer.

08:04.101 --> 08:05.103
If they had me doing
some runway ( bleep )

08:05.103 --> 08:07.273
and I was failing

08:07.273 --> 08:08.678
or there was a huge
photo shoot

08:08.678 --> 08:10.246
<i>that I was just
sucking balls at,</i>

08:10.246 --> 08:11.917
<i>then I can
understand that.</i>

08:11.917 --> 08:12.918
<i>I don't think
my dance skills</i>

08:12.918 --> 08:14.789
should replace me with someone

08:14.789 --> 08:16.325
that clearly just didn't make
the cut the first time.

08:16.325 --> 08:18.330
Right now you
just look all flushed.

08:18.330 --> 08:20.601
- Okay.
- Take a moment.

08:20.601 --> 08:22.671
You're mixing up the moves
from one place to the next.

08:22.671 --> 08:24.108
- If you make a mistake,
just keep going, okay?
- Yes.

08:24.108 --> 08:27.180
- All right.
- Thank you.

08:27.180 --> 08:28.449
Don't thank me,
just make it happen,

08:28.449 --> 08:30.286
because you don't want
to get kicked out.

08:30.286 --> 08:32.090
Tanisha:
<i>Marissa has the skills,</i>

08:32.090 --> 08:33.860
but she's focusing so much
on how bad she's doing

08:33.860 --> 08:35.698
it put her 10 steps back.

08:35.698 --> 08:38.469
Five, six, seven, eight.

08:38.469 --> 08:40.541
You got, one, two,
three, and four. Good!

08:40.541 --> 08:43.948
Five, six,
look seven, look eight.

08:43.948 --> 08:45.350
Rita:
I'm not expecting you guys
to be Janet Jackson.

08:45.350 --> 08:49.191
It's more about
just being you.

08:49.191 --> 08:50.528
You guys all made it
into this competition
over thousands,

08:50.528 --> 08:53.967
and you felt how it feels
to be eliminated.

08:53.967 --> 08:57.140
You're here to come back in.

08:57.140 --> 08:59.010
So that drive
that got you guys in?

08:59.010 --> 09:02.051
Bring that ( bleep ) back out.

09:02.051 --> 09:02.986
I'm rooting for you, okay?

09:02.986 --> 09:04.889
I want it,

09:04.889 --> 09:05.892
and I know that
I should have this.

09:05.892 --> 09:07.795
<i>I know that I should.</i>

09:07.795 --> 09:09.398
<i>Giah, you can do it.</i>

09:09.398 --> 09:10.835
Do it.
Prove everybody wrong.

09:10.835 --> 09:12.304
Figure it out
and pull it up.

09:12.304 --> 09:13.373
Who are you
and why are you
the special one?

09:13.373 --> 09:15.010
Justine:
<i>Just giving it my all,</i>

09:15.010 --> 09:16.245
because I want
the choreographer to notice me

09:16.245 --> 09:18.082
<i>and I want her
to be like,</i>

09:18.082 --> 09:18.917
"Oh, she's a really
good dancer."

09:18.917 --> 09:20.688
Try it again.

09:20.688 --> 09:21.255
Pop, pop! Pa-da-da-da!

09:24.261 --> 09:25.598
One, two, three, and four.

09:25.598 --> 09:28.002
Five. What's five?

09:28.002 --> 09:31.175
Ah! It's out.

09:31.175 --> 09:33.346
Uh-huh. Yes, out.

09:33.346 --> 09:34.916
- ( shouting )
- Oh, ( bleep ).

09:37.087 --> 09:40.761
Somebody get help!

09:40.761 --> 09:42.430
Giah:
My best friend
is on the ground.

09:42.430 --> 09:44.435
What the ( bleep )
am I gonna do?

09:44.435 --> 09:44.902
Tash:
Being reunited with
my sister,

09:48.409 --> 09:50.446
I guess it's
head to head now.

09:50.446 --> 09:52.117
You know what it's like
when someone's like,

09:52.117 --> 09:52.518
"I'm sexy,"
and you're like, "No"?

10:09.920 --> 10:12.925
Somebody get help!

10:12.925 --> 10:14.361
- Justine, can you hear
me? - Shh. Let her breathe.

10:20.439 --> 10:23.614
She's breathing.
That's good.

10:23.614 --> 10:25.117
- Yeah, that is.
- Justine is on the floor

10:25.117 --> 10:26.586
and it's scaring
the ( bleep ) out of everyone.

10:29.959 --> 10:33.733
Giah:
My best friend is
on the ground.

10:33.733 --> 10:34.969
What the ( bleep )
am I gonna do?

10:34.969 --> 10:36.607
<i>But I knew that
if I prayed</i>

10:36.607 --> 10:38.076
and I gave it to God,
she was going to wake up.

10:38.076 --> 10:38.910
And guess what I did?
I prayed and she woke up.

10:42.785 --> 10:43.787
- ( sirens wailing )
- Oh, my gosh.

10:47.460 --> 10:51.603
My focus was
to get that dance,

10:51.603 --> 10:54.107
<i>and a lot of people were
already around her.</i>

10:54.107 --> 10:54.775
So I went to the mirror
and started practicing more.

10:59.652 --> 11:04.494
Justine:
<i>It was extremely hot</i>

11:04.494 --> 11:05.330
<i>and I was
over-exerting myself,</i>

11:05.330 --> 11:06.967
<i>so I blacked out.</i>

11:06.967 --> 11:09.672
( groaning )

11:09.672 --> 11:10.306
This opportunity is
literally slipping through my
fingers.

11:13.747 --> 11:13.780
Come on, rock stars.
Y'all gotta get this together.

11:18.423 --> 11:20.961
That could have been
any one of us.

11:20.961 --> 11:22.631
This is competition
time, right?

11:22.631 --> 11:24.201
We're ready to go!
Let's go.

11:24.201 --> 11:25.971
Here we go!
Walk, walk, and sit!

11:25.971 --> 11:29.178
Roll, roll, roll!

11:29.178 --> 11:31.984
Five, six, seven, and eight.

11:31.984 --> 11:34.956
All right, ladies.
Time is up! Time is up!

11:34.956 --> 11:38.463
Okay, so, are you guys ready
to show me your moves?

11:38.463 --> 11:42.003
All: Yes!

11:42.003 --> 11:43.372
Okay, everybody's
gonna get a chance

11:43.372 --> 11:45.476
to try out
as a lead model.

11:45.476 --> 11:47.548
You're gonna rep your squad!

11:47.548 --> 11:51.823
So, first up,
it's gonna be

11:51.823 --> 11:53.660
the girls still
in this house,

11:53.660 --> 11:55.664
Team A-- "A", "A", "A".

11:55.664 --> 11:58.704
Okay, let's see
what you've got.

11:58.704 --> 12:01.910
Okay, here we go
with the music.

12:01.910 --> 12:04.716
<i>( music playing )</i>

12:04.716 --> 12:07.354
Paige:
Last time we did
a video shoot,

12:07.354 --> 12:08.857
I was one of
Director X's favorites.

12:08.857 --> 12:11.863
<i>This far in the
competition,</i>

12:11.863 --> 12:13.566
<i>it's always good
to have a leg up,</i>

12:13.566 --> 12:14.401
and I definitely feel like
I have one this week.

12:14.401 --> 12:15.671
Five, and pose.

12:15.671 --> 12:18.877
- Yasss!
- Good job.

12:18.877 --> 12:21.683
- Good job!
- All right, switch it up.

12:21.683 --> 12:24.656
- Go on, Marissa.
- Remember the formation.

12:24.656 --> 12:27.360
Where's your leg? Behind.

12:27.360 --> 12:29.064
Behind, behind, behind.
Here we go.

12:29.064 --> 12:32.070
Go on, keep going.
Whatever you want.
Just do something.

12:32.070 --> 12:35.243
Tanisha:
Marissa, she can do it.
In the challenge,

12:35.243 --> 12:37.047
<i>I did see a little moment
where she questioned
herself,</i>

12:37.047 --> 12:38.684
but as long as she rehearses
later on tonight,

12:38.684 --> 12:40.888
she'll be fantastic.

12:40.888 --> 12:42.424
And pose.

12:42.424 --> 12:44.629
Good job.
All right, next.

12:44.629 --> 12:46.566
Square up.
Make sure you're on
your right marks.

12:46.566 --> 12:49.371
This whole idea of
somebody's going to replace you

12:49.371 --> 12:52.410
kind of makes me feel
a little bit flustered.

12:52.410 --> 12:54.749
- Music.
- <i>But here I am dancing</i>

12:54.749 --> 12:58.055
with a ( bleep ) metal spine,

12:58.055 --> 13:00.761
<i>not complaining.</i>

13:00.761 --> 13:02.899
I want to be here
no matter what.

13:02.899 --> 13:04.034
Give personality,
give swag, give fear!

13:04.034 --> 13:07.708
Good job, ladies. Next up.

13:11.950 --> 13:16.158
Watching the A Team, if
that's what you want to call
them,

13:16.158 --> 13:19.164
<i>I'm just more confident
than ever,</i>

13:19.164 --> 13:20.968
<i>because I'm still in the game
and I'm just as great</i>

13:20.968 --> 13:23.773
<i>as any other girls
who are here.</i>

13:23.773 --> 13:26.378
Thank you, ladies.
Can we get the next
squad up, please?

13:26.378 --> 13:30.152
Okay, so you wanna be
in this house.

13:30.152 --> 13:32.323
You have something to prove.
Here we go, second chance.

13:32.925 --> 13:37.602
Play that track.

13:37.602 --> 13:37.735
I'm not really worried
about the girls

13:41.943 --> 13:43.747
coming back in the house
because I am never intimidated

13:43.747 --> 13:45.116
<i>by anyone who
I've already kind of beat.</i>

13:45.116 --> 13:49.157
Okay, next!

13:49.157 --> 13:53.132
Tanisha:
Tash just brightened up
the whole room to me.

13:53.132 --> 13:55.938
You can tell she's in it,
she wants this so bad.

13:55.938 --> 13:59.077
Her drive is what got me.

14:02.618 --> 14:06.425
Giah:
I know if they put me
back on this side,

14:06.425 --> 14:07.828
<i>they won't regret it,</i>

14:07.828 --> 14:09.298
Because I'll listen,
and I'll learn,

14:09.298 --> 14:10.668
and I'll go all the way
to the top.

14:10.668 --> 14:11.936
Good job.

14:14.876 --> 14:17.047
Tanisha, why don't
you take this one

14:17.047 --> 14:18.617
and announce
the two winners?

14:18.617 --> 14:20.487
So, Squad A,
the person that is

14:20.487 --> 14:23.459
going to be the leader
for this group...

14:23.459 --> 14:24.294
and that's Paige.

14:26.465 --> 14:27.333
For Squad B...

14:29.772 --> 14:30.974
Tash.

14:34.515 --> 14:37.487
Before I was eliminated
I hadn't won a challenge

14:37.487 --> 14:39.325
<i>in any of the
competitions,</i>

14:39.325 --> 14:40.694
<i>so coming back, winning,</i>

14:40.694 --> 14:42.164
Tash you're a freaking boss.

14:42.164 --> 14:44.401
Yes!

14:44.401 --> 14:47.842
Now, you have
your group leaders.

14:47.842 --> 14:50.647
You still all have to
practice for tomorrow.

14:50.647 --> 14:52.885
Paige:
<i>The three people I think
have a really good shot</i>

14:52.885 --> 14:56.358
at coming back into the
house are Tash, Giah, and Binta.

14:56.358 --> 15:00.600
I'll see you guys
out there.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.905
However, what the eliminated
girls don't realize

15:02.905 --> 15:04.642
is that competition
at this stage
in the game is fierce,

15:04.642 --> 15:07.413
and there is no room
for error.

15:09.585 --> 15:12.891
Cherish:
I'm back, bitches!

15:18.335 --> 15:22.511
Giah:
<i>It's a lot of emotions
being back in the house,</i>

15:22.511 --> 15:25.551
and the energy feels off.

15:25.551 --> 15:27.688
We're back for
as long as we want!

15:27.688 --> 15:30.961
<i>Some of the girls
are just very intimidated</i>

15:30.961 --> 15:33.600
<i>about us taking
their place,</i>

15:33.600 --> 15:36.540
but I don't care.

15:36.540 --> 15:38.242
This is a competition
at the end of the day.

15:38.242 --> 15:40.514
Nobody's here
to be friends.

15:40.514 --> 15:42.250
Your roomies are back,
back, back.

15:42.250 --> 15:44.789
Marissa:
It's been, literally,
like five minutes

15:44.789 --> 15:46.058
entertaining
all these personalities

15:46.058 --> 15:47.861
and I'm already exhausted.

15:47.861 --> 15:48.295
Like, I'm not feeling
this ( bleep ).

15:51.435 --> 15:53.607
<i>I was excited
to see Kyle, though.</i>

15:53.607 --> 15:54.642
<i>We kind of didn't get
to say even bye last time.</i>

15:54.642 --> 15:56.779
It was super awkward.

15:56.779 --> 15:58.482
I just kind of dismissed
her super fast

15:58.482 --> 16:00.654
because we were
in the bottom together.

16:00.654 --> 16:01.589
<i>I had a lot of
( bleep ) going on</i>

16:01.589 --> 16:03.927
and I don't know.

16:03.927 --> 16:05.965
Winning today just
brought me back to a point of,
"Wait a minute, Tash,

16:05.965 --> 16:08.970
you can do whatever
you want to do."

16:08.970 --> 16:10.908
You're great,
and I'm happy about that,

16:10.908 --> 16:12.745
but I was just thinking
maybe that's just not for me.

16:12.745 --> 16:14.247
But then winning today
just made me feel different.

16:14.247 --> 16:16.151
Cody:
I love my sister,
but now I feel like

16:16.151 --> 16:18.723
she is possibly
my biggest competition.

16:18.723 --> 16:21.261
- I don't want you here.
- You're so mean to me.

16:21.261 --> 16:24.802
Oh, where are my crystals?
I'm gonna pray her out of here.

16:24.802 --> 16:29.177
Cody:
<i>I'm not gonna let her
steal my thunder</i>

16:29.177 --> 16:30.447
<i>like she's done before. I'm
ready to fight for this.</i>

16:30.447 --> 16:33.820
( doorbell ringing )

16:33.820 --> 16:37.127
Somebody's
at the door, y'all.

16:37.127 --> 16:38.295
- Hi.
- How are you?
Are you okay?

16:41.368 --> 16:43.907
Yeah. No, I'm fine.

16:43.907 --> 16:45.811
I'm back.

16:45.811 --> 16:46.946
<i>My diagnosis
was extreme dehydration.</i>

16:48.950 --> 16:50.286
I'm really disappointed
in myself

16:53.827 --> 16:55.329
<i>because I missed
a lot of the dance,</i>

16:55.329 --> 16:57.266
but I'm here to focus.

16:57.266 --> 16:59.337
Pop, pop, bop, bop.

16:59.337 --> 17:01.977
- And then--
- Grab the titty.

17:01.977 --> 17:04.982
- Grab the titty.
- I think that Justine

17:04.982 --> 17:07.487
<i>is really somebody that
we need to watch out for.</i>

17:07.487 --> 17:10.661
I know that she fainted
today during the challenge,

17:10.661 --> 17:12.565
but she definitely has
fire to be back in this house.

17:12.565 --> 17:15.670
Okay, ready?
Five, six, seven, eight,
and down.

17:15.670 --> 17:19.812
Kyle:
I feel like you're really
on edge about tomorrow.

17:19.812 --> 17:21.616
Marissa:
Yeah, because I can't get
the goddamn dance right.

17:21.616 --> 17:23.786
If I don't do well tomorrow,

17:23.786 --> 17:25.624
one of y'all
get to take my spot.

17:25.624 --> 17:26.993
Yes, of course,
but you always have to view it

17:26.993 --> 17:29.364
as this is a game

17:29.364 --> 17:30.668
and you can't let the game
get the best of you.

17:30.668 --> 17:32.538
Nobody's about
to take my spot.

17:32.538 --> 17:34.140
That would be some
( bleep ) up ( bleep ).

17:34.140 --> 17:35.711
But you can take
someone else's spot.

17:35.711 --> 17:37.648
Kyle is being great
and comforting me.

17:37.648 --> 17:40.019
<i>Having someone
in the house</i>

17:40.019 --> 17:41.488
<i>that helps unwind
after a long day--</i>

17:41.488 --> 17:44.261
I don't know,
I felt giddy,

17:44.261 --> 17:45.363
like a little kid with
a school crush or something.

17:45.363 --> 17:47.868
I wanna help you.

17:47.868 --> 17:48.636
...or your shoulders
or something?

17:51.175 --> 17:52.410
Everything in
this competition

17:52.410 --> 17:54.548
is completely
out of my hands.

17:54.548 --> 17:54.915
All I really can do is enjoy
this crazy opportunity.

18:00.694 --> 18:05.537
One, two, three, and four.

18:05.537 --> 18:08.042
I am a little nervous
for tomorrow.

18:08.042 --> 18:10.881
Up. Come on.

18:10.881 --> 18:13.286
<i>But because Marissa
seems distracted,</i>

18:13.286 --> 18:16.860
that kind of makes me
feel a little bit better.

18:16.860 --> 18:20.901
Five, six, seven,
and eight.

18:20.901 --> 18:25.511
<i>I don't have anything
against the girl,</i>

18:25.511 --> 18:27.346
<i>I just don't want
to go home.</i>

18:27.346 --> 18:28.281
Please help me introduce
French Montana.

18:32.591 --> 18:33.225
- Come on, Marissa.
- The energy's not there.

18:52.463 --> 18:56.806
Krislian:
Today's shoot
is a music video.

18:56.806 --> 18:59.210
I was practicing all night

18:59.210 --> 19:01.549
because I need to make it
back inside the house.

19:01.549 --> 19:03.553
Like, there's no stopping me.

19:03.553 --> 19:04.989
Hello, hello, hello.

19:04.989 --> 19:06.926
So, today's going
to be insane.

19:06.926 --> 19:08.495
We're going to be
doing a video

19:08.495 --> 19:11.302
that's inspired by
"Bad Blood",

19:11.302 --> 19:13.439
<i>squads against squads,</i>

19:13.439 --> 19:16.111
and battling it
out today, okay?

19:16.111 --> 19:18.617
I think every girl has
imagined themselves in a music
video

19:18.617 --> 19:21.522
<i>with all their girls
behind them.</i>

19:21.522 --> 19:24.962
I am just excited.

19:24.962 --> 19:26.198
I want you to meet
Christian. This is your designer
today.

19:26.198 --> 19:29.639
Hi, girls. How are you?

19:29.639 --> 19:31.943
So Christian's designed
looks for Lady Gaga;

19:31.943 --> 19:34.681
Ciara, for the new Fergie
"MILF Money" video;

19:34.681 --> 19:37.487
and today he's designed
special looks just for you.

19:37.487 --> 19:40.594
We need you to be
fierce in them.

19:40.594 --> 19:42.665
We need you
to be bosses in them,

19:42.665 --> 19:45.436
because someone's
gonna be coming back

19:45.436 --> 19:46.773
and someone's
gonna be going home.

19:46.773 --> 19:48.108
I'm hot,
but I'm gonna work it.

19:51.214 --> 19:52.483
Giah:
<i>This opportunity means
the world to me.</i>

19:52.483 --> 19:55.155
I may get knocked down,

19:55.155 --> 19:56.893
but I will never be
knocked out. I won't.

19:56.893 --> 19:58.730
I'm ready to come back,
bitches. I'm coming back!

19:58.730 --> 20:01.636
- Hi, ladies.
- Oh, my God.

20:01.636 --> 20:04.709
Wow!

20:04.709 --> 20:08.282
Every single girl looks
so powerful.

20:08.282 --> 20:10.152
<i>Just their faces,
their outfits--</i>

20:10.152 --> 20:12.891
- they're all amazing.
- Here we go.

20:12.891 --> 20:14.728
Justine:
I plan on drinking
tons of water

20:14.728 --> 20:16.866
<i>just so I won't
faint again.</i>

20:16.866 --> 20:18.402
And I love music videos,
so I'm super confident.

20:18.402 --> 20:21.909
You've got five, six.

20:21.909 --> 20:23.513
Don't look at
the ground, baby.

20:23.513 --> 20:25.884
It's all right.
Try it again.

20:25.884 --> 20:27.554
Marissa:
Last night, Kyle and I
were just hanging out

20:27.554 --> 20:29.023
<i>and just being slightly
affectionate, I guess,</i>

20:29.023 --> 20:32.229
<i>and I didn't practice
the dance.</i>

20:32.229 --> 20:34.902
I'm feeling the pressure,
but I'm excited.

20:34.902 --> 20:36.237
<i>I'm sure that
it'll be fine.</i>

20:36.237 --> 20:38.175
Squad, ready?

20:38.175 --> 20:39.845
Courtney,
we're going on set!

20:39.845 --> 20:41.583
Paige:
We're doing sort of,
like, a dance off,

20:41.583 --> 20:42.884
<i>essentially
battling it out</i>

20:42.884 --> 20:43.586
in this underground
super-cool parking garage.

20:49.932 --> 20:53.940
( cheering )

20:53.940 --> 20:56.378
Hello!

20:56.378 --> 20:59.351
Ladies, you all
look incredible!

20:59.351 --> 21:02.223
Let's get down to
business. This bag? $100,000.

21:02.223 --> 21:05.630
This is what you are
fighting for in this video.

21:05.630 --> 21:08.870
It's all about being a boss.

21:08.870 --> 21:10.373
Now, to help me take
this video to the next level,

21:10.373 --> 21:15.215
this man is not only
so talented,

21:15.215 --> 21:17.053
he's everything I think
this video is missing.

21:17.053 --> 21:19.457
Please help me introduce
French Montana.

21:19.457 --> 21:23.733
Hello, everybody.

21:23.733 --> 21:26.740
They turnt up.

21:26.740 --> 21:28.576
What the ( bleep )?

21:28.576 --> 21:30.312
I was just
thinking about you.

21:30.312 --> 21:31.949
I was just listening to
one of his songs the other day.

21:31.949 --> 21:33.786
I'm like, "Wow."
I love French so much.

21:33.786 --> 21:36.626
We are taking
this music video
to the next level,

21:36.626 --> 21:38.629
so make me proud, okay?

21:39.264 --> 21:39.932
And action.

21:43.540 --> 21:45.710
That's the money shot.

21:45.710 --> 21:47.981
We gotta have the money shot!

21:47.981 --> 21:49.785
Cody:
French Montana's
rolling the video.

21:49.785 --> 21:51.756
He's the judge, so,
French, I'm gonna show you

21:51.756 --> 21:54.494
<i>that you can throw
any challenge at me</i>

21:54.494 --> 21:55.931
and I'm gonna take it
like a big girl.

21:55.931 --> 21:57.935
Oh, my God,
I'm freaking out.

21:57.935 --> 22:00.172
India:
Paige is the leader
of our group,

22:00.172 --> 22:03.278
<i>but I think I
will stand out</i>

22:03.278 --> 22:05.851
<i>even though
I was right behind her.</i>

22:05.851 --> 22:07.521
I'm gonna work extra,
extra hard to prove myself.

22:07.521 --> 22:10.292
Drew:
I love it!

22:10.292 --> 22:12.330
Cherish:
It doesn't matter.
They can all flip a coin.

22:12.330 --> 22:13.533
<i>I don't really care
who gets out of the house</i>

22:13.533 --> 22:16.038
because I'm
coming back in.

22:16.038 --> 22:16.972
So, um, they should
all be afraid.

22:18.576 --> 22:19.845
Work, Coryanne!

22:22.751 --> 22:24.020
Hit the face.

22:29.330 --> 22:34.207
Courtney:
I'm worried that
I'm the weakest link,

22:34.207 --> 22:35.777
but I practiced till my
legs wanted to fall off

22:35.777 --> 22:39.852
and that's all I can do.

22:39.852 --> 22:40.787
Giah: <i>Courtney is
the one to beat.</i>

22:44.227 --> 22:45.830
Everybody just praises her
because of her face,

22:45.830 --> 22:48.402
<i>but you have to have
the personality,</i>

22:48.402 --> 22:50.139
<i>the character,
the drive to be a model.</i>

22:50.139 --> 22:52.811
<i>It takes the
whole package,</i>

22:52.811 --> 22:53.713
and she's not
that kind of girl.

22:53.713 --> 22:54.982
This is so good.

22:58.556 --> 23:00.293
Tash: <i>Being reunited
with my sister,</i>

23:00.293 --> 23:02.062
<i>she really embraced
her independence.</i>

23:02.062 --> 23:04.969
I'm totally willing to let
her do her thing by herself.

23:04.969 --> 23:08.543
<i>I'm gonna do
my thing by myself.</i>

23:08.543 --> 23:10.146
And I guess
it's head to head now.

23:10.146 --> 23:12.551
Coryanne, you were great.
It was like--

23:12.551 --> 23:15.256
Paige, great.
You guys, great.

23:15.256 --> 23:15.923
But it's, like, Marissa,
the energy's not there.

23:17.326 --> 23:19.063
I'm really trying my hardest.

23:21.702 --> 23:23.172
No, but when you're up close,

23:23.172 --> 23:24.642
you're very nonchalant

23:24.642 --> 23:26.713
and it needs
to be tougher.

23:26.713 --> 23:27.747
Marissa:
<i>As hard as I'm trying,</i>

23:27.747 --> 23:29.518
all I hear is negativity.

23:29.518 --> 23:30.687
That, like,
rains on my parade.

23:30.687 --> 23:32.891
That dampers my spirit.

23:32.891 --> 23:34.695
You only have two more tries.

23:34.695 --> 23:36.565
All right,
get ready for take two.

23:36.565 --> 23:38.369
- ( bleep ).
- Come on, Marissa.

23:38.369 --> 23:40.607
Marissa, it's your moment!

23:40.607 --> 23:40.907
Rita:
Come on, ladies! Attitude.

23:43.747 --> 23:45.583
I think I heard a Beyoncé
thrown' out there.

23:45.583 --> 23:47.453
Do you want to be
here right now?

23:47.453 --> 23:48.622
Because I kinda feel
like you don't.

23:59.343 --> 24:04.186
All right,
get ready for take two.

24:04.186 --> 24:05.623
- Come on, Marissa.
- Marissa, let's take two.

24:05.623 --> 24:08.529
I'm on the way.

24:08.529 --> 24:09.965
Marissa,
it's your moment!
Here we go!

24:09.965 --> 24:13.238
Tanisha:
Turn it around! Come on!

24:13.238 --> 24:15.610
Drew:
Marissa really let me down.
She didn't hit it.

24:15.610 --> 24:18.048
<i>She didn't believe in it.
She couldn't do it.</i>

24:18.048 --> 24:19.719
<i>I mean,
she is a top contender,</i>

24:19.719 --> 24:21.321
but today she
definitely fell

24:21.321 --> 24:22.825
to the very
bottom of my list.

24:22.825 --> 24:25.062
Drew:
Okay, Squad B, you're up.

24:25.062 --> 24:27.433
I don't want
no smiling whatsoever!

24:27.433 --> 24:29.771
- You're bad bitches!
- Three, two, one. Action.

24:31.041 --> 24:36.084
Strong faces, ladies.

24:36.084 --> 24:39.558
I had this big hat on.
I had this furry jacket on.

24:39.558 --> 24:43.900
<i>It's hard to tell,
but my eyes are set
on the prize.</i>

24:43.900 --> 24:46.104
I'm gonna rock it
and I am gonna make it fun.

24:47.607 --> 24:51.983
Rita:
Come on. Come on!

24:51.983 --> 24:54.922
- That's it!
- Fab, fab!

24:54.922 --> 24:59.197
Drew:
Giah was fantastic.
Putting someone in a fur coat

24:59.197 --> 25:01.602
<i>in the middle of summer
in a hot garage,</i>

25:01.602 --> 25:04.508
and she did not complain,

25:04.508 --> 25:05.911
and she came and she used it

25:05.911 --> 25:07.915
and looked beautiful.

25:07.915 --> 25:09.751
Suck it in at all times.

25:09.751 --> 25:12.590
Firm it up
so your body is tight.

25:12.590 --> 25:14.427
I'm tensing in this jumpsuit
and you won't even see it.

25:14.427 --> 25:16.966
Three, two, one, action!

25:16.966 --> 25:19.004
Rita:
Come on, ladies!

25:19.004 --> 25:20.973
Attitude, attitude!

25:20.973 --> 25:22.476
Cherish:
<i>When I was dancing,</i>

25:22.476 --> 25:23.713
<i>I was bringing
all of me into it.</i>

25:23.713 --> 25:26.619
It was like, "This is me.

25:26.619 --> 25:28.021
Yeah, I'm going to
take your place

25:28.021 --> 25:30.192
and I'm going to
look good doing it."

25:30.192 --> 25:33.298
Tanisha: Keep rocking.
Six, seven, eight, and--

25:33.298 --> 25:35.135
Courtney:
Cherish looked like she's
had a couple of cocktails.

25:37.106 --> 25:38.274
Cherish:
I think I heard a Beyoncé
thrown out there.

25:41.549 --> 25:44.287
Something about her--

25:44.287 --> 25:45.790
"Watch out, Beyoncé,"
or something.

25:45.790 --> 25:47.895
Drew:
Let's see the money!

25:47.895 --> 25:50.800
Kyle needs to act like
she's in those heels.

25:50.800 --> 25:53.004
Kyle:
<i>I have no doubt</i>

25:53.004 --> 25:55.208
<i>that I'm not
the comeback girl.</i>

25:55.208 --> 25:56.645
I'm still giving it
150% out there.

25:56.645 --> 25:59.417
It's just-- it's so much.

25:59.417 --> 26:02.658
You're all superstars.

26:02.658 --> 26:03.191
Tash,
you're giving Grace Jones
a run for her money.

26:07.066 --> 26:09.336
- Oh, ho, ho!
- Cody: <i>I doubt my sister</i>

26:12.209 --> 26:14.214
<i>is going to replace me.
I don't think she can.</i>

26:14.214 --> 26:16.150
But she looks great.

26:16.150 --> 26:17.988
That's the last shot!
Let's go! Go!

26:17.988 --> 26:20.158
Last one!
Make it count! Come on.

26:22.831 --> 26:24.333
Giah: <i>We're looking
at each other,</i>

26:24.333 --> 26:25.770
<i>facing off,
watching each other.</i>

26:25.770 --> 26:27.874
And ( bleep ) real.
I mean...

26:27.874 --> 26:30.345
Work! Up, up, up!

26:32.750 --> 26:36.291
Drew:
<i>Everyone wants to stay</i>

26:36.291 --> 26:38.228
<i>and everyone wants
to come back,</i>

26:38.228 --> 26:39.798
so we can really see
that tension.

26:39.798 --> 26:43.105
- Nice.
- Yes!

26:43.105 --> 26:43.839
I literally just got chills.

26:46.077 --> 26:47.113
Like, I actually got
goosebumps from the girls.

26:47.113 --> 26:50.252
Drew: Yes!

26:50.252 --> 26:51.421
Justine:
<i>Your girl killed it,</i>

26:51.421 --> 26:53.092
and I'm still killing it.

26:53.092 --> 26:54.360
And no matter what,
I'm gonna kill it.

26:54.360 --> 26:56.097
Rita:
Nice energy, Binta.

26:56.097 --> 26:58.234
I can honestly say
I've never ever

26:58.234 --> 27:00.640
actually danced my ass off
like this before.

27:00.640 --> 27:02.710
<i>I want these judges to see
I can really deliver.</i>

27:02.710 --> 27:05.884
I think I have a good chance.

27:05.884 --> 27:08.221
Courtney:
<i>One of us is going to
be switched out</i>

27:08.221 --> 27:10.058
<i>for one of the girls
in the other group.</i>

27:10.058 --> 27:11.562
I'm nervous.
I'm very nervous.

27:11.562 --> 27:13.566
Tanisha:
Pose, nice!

27:13.566 --> 27:16.404
Drew:
It's so good.

27:16.404 --> 27:16.939
- Yes.
- Okay, ladies,
we are done,

27:19.377 --> 27:22.116
That's a wrap. Thank you!

27:22.116 --> 27:24.789
Really good.

27:24.789 --> 27:25.055
- Love you. Thank you.
- Love you, too, baby.

27:47.767 --> 27:51.508
Rita:
So it's nice to see everyone
back together again.

27:53.579 --> 27:55.516
Tonight we'll be doing
things a little differently.

27:58.088 --> 28:02.163
One of you seven models

28:02.163 --> 28:04.300
still in the competition
will be going home.

28:04.300 --> 28:08.274
And one of you
seven models

28:08.274 --> 28:10.212
who were previously eliminated

28:10.212 --> 28:12.850
will re-enter the competition

28:12.850 --> 28:15.690
to prove you have what it takes

28:15.690 --> 28:17.861
to be the next top model.

28:17.861 --> 28:19.998
Now, let's say hello to
our amazing judges--

28:19.998 --> 28:22.403
Gorgeous supermodel and
body activist Ashley Graham.

28:22.403 --> 28:25.677
Amazing image architect
of the stars--

28:25.677 --> 28:28.281
I love you-- Law Roach.

28:28.281 --> 28:31.387
Our incredible
creative consultant,

28:31.387 --> 28:33.960
Chief Creative Officer
at "Paper Magazine,"
Drew Elliott.

28:33.960 --> 28:36.397
The winner of
"Next Top Model"
will receive $100,000

28:36.397 --> 28:40.172
and be featured in
a commercial

28:40.172 --> 28:42.811
thanks to Rimmel London.

28:42.811 --> 28:44.982
In addition, the winner
will also be featured

28:44.982 --> 28:47.654
<i>in a fashion spread
for "Paper Magazine,"</i>

28:47.654 --> 28:50.593
and get an exclusive one-year
talent deal with VH1.

28:50.593 --> 28:54.033
So this week,
your squads battled it out
in a fashion video.

28:55.269 --> 28:59.511
- Let's take a look.
- ( music playing )

28:59.511 --> 29:01.916
( whispering )

29:01.916 --> 29:02.717
( music continues )

29:37.186 --> 29:41.862
( cheering )

29:41.862 --> 29:43.432
Rita: All right,
so now let's look

29:43.432 --> 29:45.369
at each of your
individual performances,

29:45.369 --> 29:46.805
beginning with the girls
still in the competition.

29:46.805 --> 29:50.914
Paige, first up.

29:50.914 --> 29:52.550
- Hi, judges.
- Ashley: Hi.

29:52.550 --> 29:53.585
Let's take a look
how you did.

29:57.727 --> 30:02.469
My vote is you.
I mean, you killed it.
You slayed.

30:02.469 --> 30:06.311
I didn't see
a cheerleader today.

30:06.311 --> 30:08.549
I saw a superhero
blonde supermodel.

30:08.549 --> 30:12.557
- Thank you so much.
- Rita: Thanks, Paige.

30:12.557 --> 30:13.424
Next up, Tatiana.

30:18.401 --> 30:23.411
I think that you were always
focusing on the dance moves

30:23.411 --> 30:25.583
and you were kind of
forgetting to give me face.

30:25.583 --> 30:28.623
I don't think that moving
is your strong suit.

30:28.623 --> 30:30.760
You did look a little like
a fish out of water this week.

30:30.760 --> 30:34.299
Next up, Coryanne.

30:40.412 --> 30:45.255
You look like
one of Rhianna's girls.

30:45.255 --> 30:46.925
- Really?
- At the end when you showed

30:46.925 --> 30:47.994
a little butt cheek,
like, "Ah!" Yes!

30:47.994 --> 30:51.267
Thank you so much.

30:51.267 --> 30:53.539
- Marissa.
How are-- are you okay?
- Yes, nervous.

30:53.539 --> 30:57.279
I know. You weren't
the biggest fan of this
challenge, were you?

30:57.279 --> 31:00.152
I was super lost.

31:00.152 --> 31:00.519
Rita:
Let's take a look.

31:05.796 --> 31:10.607
Your face-- it just looks like
you were just petrified.

31:10.607 --> 31:14.446
You had one, like,
one of the sexiest looks,

31:14.446 --> 31:17.385
and you just kind of fizzled.

31:17.385 --> 31:19.457
I don't know
what happened, Marissa.

31:19.457 --> 31:21.294
I know what happened.
You weren't there in spirit.

31:21.294 --> 31:24.366
You didn't show up.

31:24.366 --> 31:26.337
I'm not sure
how I wasn't there.

31:26.337 --> 31:27.741
I literally was asking,
"What am I doing wrong?"

31:27.741 --> 31:29.210
This is about what
Tanisha said to me,

31:29.210 --> 31:30.212
which is you just
weren't there.

31:30.212 --> 31:31.715
Whatever that issue was,

31:31.715 --> 31:33.084
you need to learn how
to leave it at home.

31:33.084 --> 31:35.990
That's it.
Next up, Courtney.

31:35.990 --> 31:40.265
- How are you?
- Courtney: I feel great.

31:40.265 --> 31:41.334
You guys kinda sparked a
fire under my butt last week.

31:41.334 --> 31:44.507
Let's have a look.

31:49.050 --> 31:53.258
Let's not give this girl
another challenge

31:53.258 --> 31:55.730
where she has to dance,

31:55.730 --> 31:57.600
because I cannot sit through
another challenge.

31:57.600 --> 32:01.107
I really tried.

32:01.107 --> 32:02.510
You know you didn't do
that great, but that's okay

32:02.510 --> 32:05.616
- because your face is
epic. - Thank you.

32:05.616 --> 32:07.520
You have a new attitude.
It's showing through your work.

32:07.520 --> 32:09.758
I'm proud of you.

32:09.758 --> 32:11.227
Okay, India.

32:16.839 --> 32:21.748
- I live.
- I loved it.

32:21.748 --> 32:24.521
I kept staring at your face
and your body in this outfit.

32:24.521 --> 32:27.126
You're giving me
a "Suicide Squad" moment.

32:27.126 --> 32:29.565
This is superstar ( bleep
). You know what I mean?

32:29.565 --> 32:31.602
- Keep it up, baby.
- Thank you very much, India.

32:31.602 --> 32:32.703
- Thank you, guys.
- Last up for Squad A, Cody.

32:39.751 --> 32:44.460
You did an amazing job
with that hat.

32:44.460 --> 32:46.498
Every so often
you gave a moment

32:46.498 --> 32:48.101
where you raised
your neck high enough

32:48.101 --> 32:49.136
so that the light
caught your face.

32:49.136 --> 32:51.207
You did an excellent job.

32:51.207 --> 32:52.711
I just wish your ending
shot was a little stronger.

32:52.711 --> 32:54.815
How you kinda put
your shoulder to the camera?

32:54.815 --> 32:56.585
It could've just been
like a fade-out, like...

32:56.585 --> 32:58.321
with the hat down.

32:58.321 --> 32:59.122
That's why I'm a supermodel.

33:03.732 --> 33:05.503
So now for the seven of you
competing for a second chance,

33:05.503 --> 33:08.007
let's start off
with the other winner
of the challenge, Tash.

33:16.191 --> 33:21.267
Well, that's why you won,
that last look.

33:21.267 --> 33:24.473
Tash:
When we were working
with Tanisha,

33:24.473 --> 33:26.912
I was like,
"This is a dream come true."

33:26.912 --> 33:28.582
So that's why
I was kinda just determined
to pick up the moves.

33:28.582 --> 33:30.251
I think that you came back
meaning business.

33:31.253 --> 33:33.024
Up next, Kyle.

33:39.771 --> 33:44.313
You have such
a great look, Kyle,

33:44.313 --> 33:47.018
like, you have
such a great face,

33:47.018 --> 33:49.056
but do you wanna be
here right now?

33:49.056 --> 33:50.225
Because I kinda
feel like you don't.

33:50.225 --> 33:52.863
I mean, I find it frustrating

33:52.863 --> 33:55.301
that I was eliminated
for a hip-hop music video

33:55.301 --> 33:59.276
and invited back
to do another
hip-hop music video.

33:59.276 --> 34:01.615
I get it.
Like, I sympathize with you,

34:01.615 --> 34:03.785
but I wish you had
just dug a little deeper

34:03.785 --> 34:05.823
and forced something else
out, a little bit more strength.

34:05.823 --> 34:07.627
- Sorry.
- Thank you, Kyle.

34:09.964 --> 34:12.670
Next up, Justine.

34:12.670 --> 34:15.844
Justine scared
the living crap out of me.

34:15.844 --> 34:19.818
Ashley:
Oh, really?

34:19.818 --> 34:21.521
She actually passed out
and needed medical attention.

34:21.521 --> 34:22.857
But on the positive,
she learned the moves

34:22.857 --> 34:25.061
and she showed up.

34:29.003 --> 34:33.846
I don't love the video,
but I love the story
behind the video.

34:33.846 --> 34:37.486
Drew: You know, you have
to be beautiful, you are.

34:37.486 --> 34:40.325
You have to work hard,
which you did.

34:40.325 --> 34:41.928
That's the most
that I can ask for.

34:41.928 --> 34:44.433
Rita: Binta.

34:48.709 --> 34:53.384
It's like you were
thinking about your mouth too
much.

34:53.384 --> 34:55.388
It was like
you were focused too much

34:55.388 --> 34:57.025
on the dance moves
and not being a model.

34:57.025 --> 35:01.200
I think it was perfect.

35:01.200 --> 35:02.704
I think the close-ups
of are killer,

35:02.704 --> 35:05.041
and I've been quietly
a very big Binta fan.

35:05.041 --> 35:08.515
Thank you, Binta.

35:08.515 --> 35:09.684
Next up, Cherish.

35:11.755 --> 35:12.791
- Hi, Cherish.
- Hi!

35:12.791 --> 35:14.059
Drew: Hi.

35:18.467 --> 35:23.244
That, I think
we can both agree,

35:23.244 --> 35:25.382
wasn't your best piece
of art, right?

35:25.382 --> 35:27.152
I thought it was
pretty good, though.
I liked it.

35:27.152 --> 35:29.389
There is a look to you
that could be an amazing model.

35:29.389 --> 35:33.566
But when you try and do--
it's like when someone's like,

35:33.566 --> 35:35.836
"I'm sexy,"
and you're like, "No."

35:35.836 --> 35:39.476
It's like, don't do that.

35:39.476 --> 35:40.713
Do the things
that are uniquely you.

35:40.713 --> 35:43.384
But, you know,
I felt like I served it.

35:43.384 --> 35:44.554
But it comes off like
drunk auntie with a cigarette.

35:44.554 --> 35:47.893
- Okay.
- Okay.

35:47.893 --> 35:49.396
Rita: Krislian.

35:53.606 --> 35:57.980
The dance and the attitude
doesn't even feel like you.

35:57.980 --> 36:02.591
Like, this is great.

36:02.591 --> 36:04.092
I loved your hair
and I loved your makeup.

36:04.092 --> 36:05.428
It was a little
bit of a hard edge,

36:05.428 --> 36:06.431
which I thought
it was really cool.

36:06.431 --> 36:08.134
Rita:
Okay, last up, Giah.

36:12.777 --> 36:17.586
"Boom, I'm back!
I'm Giah! What?"

36:17.586 --> 36:19.958
You did a really good job
and I'm very proud of you.

36:19.958 --> 36:21.962
- Thank you.
- I wish that there was

36:21.962 --> 36:23.497
just that little extra
glimmer or pop,

36:23.497 --> 36:26.538
because I think that
there's still things

36:26.538 --> 36:28.776
you're working on as a
model, and that's okay.

36:28.776 --> 36:30.478
You know, your performance
was just impeccable.

36:30.478 --> 36:33.117
I've never seen
this side of you before

36:33.117 --> 36:35.455
and I'm very happy
I got to see it.

36:35.455 --> 36:36.725
One of the things I hated
that I had to keep
saying this to you is

36:36.725 --> 36:39.129
you don't give me model,
you give me actress.

36:39.129 --> 36:40.132
But in this you gave me
model, you gave me dancer,

36:40.132 --> 36:42.904
and you did an
amazing job.

36:42.904 --> 36:45.108
Thank you, guys.
I love you all.

36:45.108 --> 36:47.279
Okay, models,
now we are gonna decide

36:47.279 --> 36:49.884
who is coming back
into the competition

36:49.884 --> 36:52.656
and who is going home.

37:05.983 --> 37:10.559
Models, welcome back.

37:10.559 --> 37:12.262
The judges have deliberated.

37:12.262 --> 37:14.534
We'll start with the girls
still in-house.

37:14.534 --> 37:15.769
The model who has
the best video this week is...

37:16.505 --> 37:21.046
India.

37:21.046 --> 37:21.714
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

37:24.052 --> 37:26.825
Next name
I'm gonna call is...

37:26.825 --> 37:29.063
Paige.

37:29.063 --> 37:29.831
Cody.

37:32.269 --> 37:32.903
Coryanne.

37:35.409 --> 37:37.045
Which model is about
to join these ladies?

37:41.220 --> 37:45.529
- Tatiana.
- Thank you, guys.

37:45.529 --> 37:48.100
Will Courtney and Marissa
please step forward?

37:51.775 --> 37:56.584
Courtney, last week,

37:56.584 --> 37:57.754
you were in the bottom two
because of your attitude.

37:57.754 --> 38:00.458
This week, we've seen,

38:00.458 --> 38:02.630
whoa, a great adjustment,

38:02.630 --> 38:04.768
but the competition?
It's stiff.

38:04.768 --> 38:07.773
Marissa, the judges
feel the pressure
that the last few weeks--

38:07.773 --> 38:10.712
maybe you're not ready
for what the rest of this
competition will bring.

38:10.712 --> 38:15.288
So, the decision
has been made,

38:15.288 --> 38:18.629
and the one that is
staying another week

38:18.629 --> 38:20.298
to prove they have
what it takes to be
the next top model is...

38:24.774 --> 38:28.883
Courtney.

38:28.883 --> 38:30.284
Thank you.

38:32.890 --> 38:36.798
- Congratulations,
Courtney. - Thank you.

38:36.798 --> 38:39.804
Marissa, you have
so much ahead of you.

38:39.804 --> 38:41.808
- You made it so far
already. - Thank you so much.

38:41.808 --> 38:43.979
I'm going home
over a video shoot.

38:43.979 --> 38:47.653
<i>Let's just clear that up.</i>

38:47.653 --> 38:49.624
<i>I'm not going home
because my photos suck,
that's for sure.</i>

38:49.624 --> 38:51.628
<i>To the girl that's
replacing me-- good job.</i>

38:51.628 --> 38:53.364
<i>I hope you go far
in this competition,</i>

38:53.364 --> 38:55.335
<i>further than you
did the first time.</i>

38:55.335 --> 38:57.506
<i>This was an amazing
opportunity</i>

38:57.506 --> 38:59.476
<i>and I'm just gonna take
everything I've learned</i>

38:59.476 --> 39:00.980
<i>and just become
a better model.</i>

39:00.980 --> 39:03.183
I'm proud of myself.

39:03.183 --> 39:04.821
Now, who is going
to take her place?

39:04.821 --> 39:07.960
Only one of you
will get a second chance.

39:07.960 --> 39:10.933
So if I call your name,

39:10.933 --> 39:12.168
you will not be moving
forward in the competition.

39:13.639 --> 39:15.007
- Cherish.
- Bye, guys.

39:17.813 --> 39:20.484
- Kyle.
- Thanks, guys.

39:22.523 --> 39:24.860
Justine.

39:26.565 --> 39:27.465
Binta.

39:34.848 --> 39:39.524
Krislian.

39:39.524 --> 39:40.726
Will Giah and Tash
please step forward?

39:46.203 --> 39:51.013
Giah, you were
sent home weeks ago

39:51.013 --> 39:53.484
because the judges
just didn't see
a top model in you.

39:53.484 --> 39:57.392
Today you brought
something completely different.

39:57.392 --> 40:01.868
Tash, you were given
the opportunity to come back

40:01.868 --> 40:05.041
and you did it
with a vengeance.

40:05.041 --> 40:06.043
So, who'll be getting
a second chance to come back?

40:07.379 --> 40:09.416
Please believe us
when I say this was so hard.

40:14.359 --> 40:15.027
Tash...

40:18.736 --> 40:19.905
congratulations,
and welcome back

40:19.905 --> 40:23.244
into the competition.

40:23.244 --> 40:24.714
Thank you.
Thank you, guys.

40:24.714 --> 40:27.251
You have a steep hill to climb

40:27.251 --> 40:29.289
to catch up with these
girls, but we believe in you.

40:29.289 --> 40:32.630
Tash:
<i>I feel like I'm in
a dream state right now.</i>

40:32.630 --> 40:35.068
I just feel like
I can't be defeated.

40:35.068 --> 40:37.205
<i>I did my absolute best,</i>

40:37.205 --> 40:39.176
and I can see
in the girls' faces

40:39.176 --> 40:41.246
now that I'm back,
they are terrified.

40:41.246 --> 40:43.417
I'm just ready
to take some girls down.

40:43.417 --> 40:45.689
Okay, ladies,
congratulations,
and thank you.

40:45.689 --> 40:47.593
- Tash, welcome back.
- Thank you.

40:47.593 --> 40:48.928
I'll see you soon.

40:58.114 --> 41:01.921
I wanna introduce you
to a friend of mine,
Ms. Amber Rose.

41:04.059 --> 41:06.396
Hello, hello! Hi!

41:08.936 --> 41:10.940
Amber Rose is a boss.
She's a superstar right now.

41:10.940 --> 41:12.876
Today, you are going to
be embodying some
of the most iconic

41:12.876 --> 41:16.618
boss ladies
in pop culture history.

41:16.618 --> 41:17.820
With this character,
it's a little bit raunchier
and dirtier.

41:17.820 --> 41:21.326
Think more iconic poses.

41:21.326 --> 41:23.766
Everything's
a little limp noodle.

41:23.766 --> 41:26.436
I don't know where
the confidence has gone.

41:26.436 --> 41:26.904
- You're coasting right
now. - Do not get comfortable.

41:32.015 --> 41:35.589
<i>We see your beauty.</i>
