WEBVTT

02:31.960 --> 02:34.560
I'll give you one try, girl.

02:37.260 --> 02:39.310
Kill me and you're free.

02:39.800 --> 02:42.850
But if I live, I'll break both your hands.

02:45.350 --> 02:47.190
Go on, hit me.

02:48.100 --> 02:49.650
Hit me hard.

02:59.740 --> 03:00.910
Sulk all you want.

03:01.950 --> 03:04.450
The truth is, you're lucky.

03:06.160 --> 03:08.670
You don't want to be alone out here, girl.

03:08.830 --> 03:11.340
Someone worse than me would find you.

03:11.790 --> 03:13.260
There's no one worse than you.

03:13.340 --> 03:15.680
(SCOFFS) You never knew my brother.

03:15.800 --> 03:18.140
He once killed a man for snoring.

03:18.590 --> 03:20.590
There's plenty worse than me.

03:20.680 --> 03:25.270
There's men who like to beat little
girls, men who like to rape them.

03:25.350 --> 03:28.020
I saved your sister from some of them.

03:29.270 --> 03:30.690
You're lying-

03:30.770 --> 03:32.610
Ask her, if you ever see her again.

03:32.690 --> 03:37.040
Ask her who came back
for her when the mob had her on her back.

03:39.070 --> 03:41.420
They would have taken her every which way

03:41.530 --> 03:43.880
and left her there with
her throat cut open.

03:49.580 --> 03:50.880
Is that the Blackwater?

03:51.080 --> 03:52.760
The Blackwater?

03:53.540 --> 03:55.590
Where do you think I'm taking you?

03:57.550 --> 04:00.680
Back to King's Landing,
to Joffrey and the Queen.

04:00.760 --> 04:03.310
Fuck Joffrey. Fuck the Queen.

04:03.390 --> 04:07.520
That's the Red Fork.
I'm taking you to the Twins.

04:09.310 --> 04:10.690
But why?

04:11.060 --> 04:15.780
Your mother and brother will be
there, and they'll pay me for you.

04:17.899 --> 04:20.070
Why would they be at the Twins?

04:20.200 --> 04:24.450
(LAUGHS) Those outlaws
you love so much never told you?

04:24.530 --> 04:27.380
The whole countryside is yapping about it.

04:28.080 --> 04:31.080
Your uncle is marrying
one of the Frey girls.

04:31.620 --> 04:33.630
So quit trying to bash my skull in,

04:33.710 --> 04:37.760
and we might
just make it there in time for the wedding.

04:43.180 --> 04:44.770
(HORSES NEIGHING)

04:54.100 --> 04:56.450
Men who fight for gold
have neither honor nor loyalty.

04:57.020 --> 04:58.740
They cannot be trusted.

04:58.820 --> 05:01.240
JORAH: They can be
trusted to kill you if they're well paid.

05:01.320 --> 05:03.490
The Yunkish are paying them well.

05:03.570 --> 05:05.290
You know these men?

05:05.620 --> 05:07.460
Only by the broken swords on their banners.

05:08.410 --> 05:11.080
They're called the Second Sons.

05:11.160 --> 05:16.220
A company led by
a Braavosi named Mero, the Titan's Bastard.

05:16.840 --> 05:19.090
Is he more titan or bastard?

05:19.170 --> 05:22.970
He's a dangerous man, Khaleesi.
They all are.

05:24.680 --> 05:25.800
How many?

05:26.970 --> 05:30.820
BARRISTAN: 2,000, Your Grace.
Armored and mounted.

05:31.140 --> 05:32.890
Enough to make a difference?

05:32.980 --> 05:34.480
(FLY BUZZING)

05:36.980 --> 05:39.860
It's hard to collect wages from a corpse.

05:39.980 --> 05:42.580
I'm sure the sellswords
prefer to fight for the winning side.

05:43.150 --> 05:44.780
I imagine you're right.

05:45.740 --> 05:49.120
I'd like to talk
to the Titan's Bastard about winning.

05:49.200 --> 05:51.170
He may not agree to meet.

05:51.250 --> 05:52.590
He will.

05:52.700 --> 05:56.500
A man who fights
for gold can't afford to lose to a girl.

05:56.580 --> 05:58.680
BARRISTAN: Your Grace, allow me to present

05:58.790 --> 06:00.890
The captains of the Second Sons,

06:02.130 --> 06:04.010
Mero of Braavos,

06:04.840 --> 06:07.010
Prendahl na Ghezn,

06:07.840 --> 06:09.310
and, um...

06:09.600 --> 06:11.690
Daario Naharis.

06:16.520 --> 06:18.070
You are the Mother of Dragons?

06:19.860 --> 06:22.280
I swear I fucked you once
in a pleasure house in Lys.

06:22.360 --> 06:23.530
Mind your tongue.

06:23.690 --> 06:24.910
MERO: Why?

06:24.990 --> 06:26.080
I didn't mind hers.

06:27.660 --> 06:30.130
She licked my ass like
she was born to do it.

06:32.370 --> 06:33.420
(MERO CHUCKLES)

06:33.500 --> 06:35.710
You, slave girl, bring wine.

06:35.830 --> 06:37.050
We have no slaves here.

06:38.540 --> 06:42.300
You'll all be
slaves after the battle, unless I save you.

06:44.340 --> 06:46.810
Take your clothes off
and come and sit on Mero's lap,

06:46.880 --> 06:48.560
And I may give you my Second Sons.

06:48.640 --> 06:51.140
Give me your Second Sons
and I may not have you gelded.

06:51.220 --> 06:52.220
(CHUCKLES)

06:52.310 --> 06:54.680
Ser Barristan,
how many men fight for the Second Sons?

06:54.770 --> 06:56.940
Under 2,000, Your Grace.

06:57.060 --> 06:59.150
We have more, don't we?

06:59.230 --> 07:01.200
BARRISTAN: 10,000 Unsullied.

07:01.270 --> 07:03.400
I'm only a young girl,
new to the ways of war,

07:03.570 --> 07:05.660
but perhaps a seasoned
captain like yourself

07:05.740 --> 07:09.290
can explain to me
how you propose to defeat us.

07:09.360 --> 07:11.960
I hope the old man is better with
a sword than he is with a lie.

07:12.530 --> 07:14.290
You have 8,000 Unsullied.

07:17.210 --> 07:18.750
You're very young to be a captain.

07:18.830 --> 07:21.510
He's not a captain. He's a lieutenant.

07:22.340 --> 07:24.260
Even if your numbers are right,

07:24.420 --> 07:26.340
the odds don't favor your side.

07:26.420 --> 07:28.520
The Second Sons have
faced worse odds and won.

07:28.590 --> 07:31.060
The Second Sons have
faced worse odds and run.

07:32.930 --> 07:34.350
Or you could fight for me.

07:34.680 --> 07:35.680
(MERO CHUCKLES)

07:37.430 --> 07:41.190
We've taken
the slavers' gold. We fight for Yunkai.

07:41.900 --> 07:43.020
DAENERYS: I would pay you
as much and more.

07:43.150 --> 07:44.270
(SNIFFING)

07:45.780 --> 07:47.650
PRENDAHL: Our contract is our bond.

07:47.740 --> 07:51.460
If we break our bond,
no one will hire the Second Sons again.

07:51.530 --> 07:54.750
Ride with me
and you'll never need another contract.

07:54.830 --> 07:57.750
You'll have gold and
castles and lordships of your choosing

07:57.830 --> 07:59.710
when I take back the Seven Kingdoms.

07:59.790 --> 08:01.870
DAARIO: You have no ships.
You have no siege weapons.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.550
You have no cavalry.

08:04.090 --> 08:08.640
A fortnight ago, I had
no army. A year ago, I had no dragons.

08:11.640 --> 08:13.310
You have two days to decide.

08:16.470 --> 08:17.570
Show me your cunt. I want to see

08:17.640 --> 08:18.770
- if it's worth fighting for.
- (BOTH IN VALYRIAN)

08:19.480 --> 08:22.650
My Queen, shall I slice out
his tongue for you?

08:23.270 --> 08:25.150
These men are our guests.

08:26.400 --> 08:27.900
You seem to be enjoying my wine.

08:27.980 --> 08:30.360
Perhaps you'd like a flagon
to help you ponder.

08:30.450 --> 08:34.450
Only a flagon?
And what are my brothers in arms to drink?

08:34.530 --> 08:36.539
- A barrel, then.
- Good.

08:37.909 --> 08:40.919
The Titan's Bastard does not drink alone.

08:43.080 --> 08:45.210
In the Second Sons, we share everything.

08:45.340 --> 08:47.510
After the battle, maybe
we'll all share you.

08:53.260 --> 08:55.140
I'll come looking for
you when this is over.

08:58.520 --> 09:04.610
Ser Barristan,
if it comes to battle, kill that one first.

09:04.860 --> 09:07.030
Gladly, Your Grace.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.420
Half Robert, half lowborn.

10:04.460 --> 10:05.800
Show the boy to his chambers.

10:05.870 --> 10:09.850
Have the maids draw him
a bath and find him some decent clothes.

10:10.130 --> 10:11.300
I'll come visit you soon.

10:20.310 --> 10:21.590
What do you mean to do with him?

10:21.640 --> 10:22.890
You know.

10:23.020 --> 10:25.690
Then why bathe him
and dress him in fine clothes?

10:25.770 --> 10:28.360
If it needs to be
done, do it. Don't torture the boy.

10:28.440 --> 10:30.940
Have you ever slaughtered a lamb, my king?

10:31.570 --> 10:32.610
No.

10:33.240 --> 10:37.210
If the lamb sees the knife, she panics.

10:37.950 --> 10:42.120
Her panic seeps into
her meat, darkens it, fouls the flavor.

10:42.490 --> 10:44.710
You've slaughtered many lambs?

10:45.830 --> 10:47.800
And none have seen the blade.

10:56.800 --> 10:57.800

They feeding you enough?

12:00.530 --> 12:02.000
Two meals a day.

12:02.070 --> 12:06.120
Cold for breakfast,
hot for supper. I cannot complain.

12:07.750 --> 12:09.710
You don't belong in a place like this.

12:09.790 --> 12:12.670
Well, it's sad to say, but I've seen worse.

12:13.920 --> 12:15.170
Yeah.

12:18.380 --> 12:20.220
I'm sorry about your son.

12:21.720 --> 12:23.850
Didn't get the chance to tell you before.

12:24.220 --> 12:26.600
Good lad. Loyal lad.

12:30.390 --> 12:32.400
Melisandre's returned.

12:33.730 --> 12:35.820
I didn't know she'd been gone.

12:35.900 --> 12:38.240
Came back with a bastard boy.

12:39.440 --> 12:41.040
Robert's bastard boy.

12:41.110 --> 12:42.240
Why?

12:43.410 --> 12:45.910
She says there's power in king's blood.

12:47.580 --> 12:48.700
She's going to kill him.

12:48.830 --> 12:50.000
Sacrifice him.

12:50.080 --> 12:52.170
Forgive me, Your Grace,
I'm not a learned man,

12:52.250 --> 12:54.470
but is there a difference
between kill and sacrifice?

12:55.670 --> 12:57.090
The boy is your nephew.

12:57.170 --> 12:59.300
What of it? We're at war.

12:59.630 --> 13:02.380
Why should I spare the son
of some tavern slut

13:02.510 --> 13:05.100
Robert bedded one drunken night?

13:05.600 --> 13:07.390
Because he has your blood in his veins.

13:09.930 --> 13:11.110
So did Renly.

13:13.020 --> 13:14.690
Renly wronged you.

13:14.810 --> 13:17.360
Renly declared himself
king when the throne belonged to you.

13:17.440 --> 13:20.070
He raised an army, stole your bannermen.

13:20.780 --> 13:22.280
This boy has done you no harm.

13:22.360 --> 13:23.610
He's an innocent.

13:23.740 --> 13:24.990
How many boys live in Westeros?

13:25.490 --> 13:28.370
How many girls?
How many men? How many women?

13:28.450 --> 13:31.960
The darkness will devour them all, she
says. The night that never ends.

13:32.710 --> 13:36.180
Unless I triumph. I never asked for this.

13:36.250 --> 13:37.970
No more than I asked to be king.

13:38.290 --> 13:43.640
We do not choose our destiny,
but we must do our duty, no?

13:44.220 --> 13:46.520
Great or small, we must do our duty.

13:48.510 --> 13:51.810
What's one bastard boy against a kingdom?

13:55.310 --> 13:59.490
Your Grace,
why did you come to see me today?

14:00.360 --> 14:02.110
I came to free you.

14:02.490 --> 14:05.960
If you swear never to raise your hand
to the Lady Melisandre again.

14:06.820 --> 14:08.170
I swear it.

14:09.240 --> 14:10.990
I can't swear never to speak against her.

14:11.540 --> 14:13.500
You have little regard for your own life.

14:13.620 --> 14:16.630
Quite little, Your Grace. Verging on none.

14:18.330 --> 14:21.340
You could have
freed me yesterday or tomorrow,

14:22.010 --> 14:24.430
but you came to me now
before this boy is put to the knife

14:24.510 --> 14:28.180
because you knew I'd counsel restraint.

14:29.850 --> 14:33.100
You came to hear me
say it because you believe it yourself.

14:33.180 --> 14:36.480
You're not a man who
slaughters innocents for gain or glory.

14:41.730 --> 14:44.200
When my son was five, he said to me,

14:45.030 --> 14:47.080
"I don't ever want to die."

14:47.160 --> 14:50.750
I wanted to say to him,
"You won't, child. You won't ever."

14:51.160 --> 14:55.290
I hated the idea
of him lying awake in the dark, afraid.

14:59.210 --> 15:01.050
I think mothers and
fathers made up the Gods

15:01.130 --> 15:05.050
because they wanted their
children to sleep through the night.

15:06.260 --> 15:08.640
I saw a vision in the flames.

15:11.220 --> 15:15.230
A great battle in the snow. I saw it.

15:18.230 --> 15:20.570
And you saw whatever she gave birth to.

15:21.980 --> 15:24.950
I never believed, but
when you see the truth,

15:25.070 --> 15:28.040
when it's right there in front of you,

15:28.110 --> 15:33.210
as real as these iron bars,
how can you deny her god is real?

15:47.340 --> 15:49.560
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

15:53.850 --> 15:54.850
(GRUNTS)

15:54.930 --> 15:57.150
That dragon bitch. She talks too much.

15:57.230 --> 15:58.900
You talk too much.

15:58.980 --> 16:01.450
She won't talk so much
when she's choking on my cock.

16:01.520 --> 16:04.120
8,000 Unsullied stand
between her and your cock.

16:05.360 --> 16:07.700
My cock will find a way. Tell him.

16:08.240 --> 16:10.330
Is there any place that
my cock can't reach?

16:10.410 --> 16:12.660
She'll tell me whatever
you pay her to tell me.

16:12.740 --> 16:16.090
Daario Naharis, the whore
who doesn't like whores.

16:16.160 --> 16:19.130
I like them very much.
I just refuse to pay them.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.720
And I'm no whore, my friend.

16:22.250 --> 16:24.340
She sells her sheath, and
you sell your blade.

16:24.420 --> 16:26.470
- What's the difference?
- I fight for beauty.

16:26.550 --> 16:28.390
- (MERO LAUGHS)
- For beauty?

16:28.460 --> 16:30.060
We fight for gold.

16:30.130 --> 16:34.140
The Gods gave men two gifts to
entertain ourselves before we die,

16:34.800 --> 16:37.560
the thrill of fucking

16:42.350 --> 16:43.900
PRENDAHL: What do we do
about the dragon girl?

16:43.980 --> 16:46.200
We can't beat 8,000 Unsullied
on the battlefield.

16:46.690 --> 16:49.490
There won't be a battle,
and we don't have to deal with her eunuchs.

16:49.570 --> 16:51.120
We only have to deal with her.

16:51.200 --> 16:52.370
She's well guarded.

16:52.490 --> 16:53.710
Tonight's a new moon.

16:53.780 --> 16:57.790
One of us slips into her camp past
her Unsullied and her knights.

16:58.700 --> 17:00.330
Which one of us?

17:02.540 --> 17:03.710
Close your eyes, love.

17:05.880 --> 17:07.420
(CLEARS THROAT)

17:10.210 --> 17:11.339
Three coins.

17:12.470 --> 17:14.220
A coin from Meereen,

17:14.589 --> 17:16.390
a coin from Volantis,

17:16.930 --> 17:18.060
and a coin from Braavos.

17:18.140 --> 17:19.810
The Braavosi does the deed.

17:24.480 --> 17:26.730
One for each of us, darling.

17:27.400 --> 17:28.780
No peeking.

17:45.170 --> 17:46.290
Do you hear me?

17:47.040 --> 17:49.550
Follow my voice. I'm right here.

17:50.760 --> 17:51.800

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

18:17.240 --> 18:18.540

18:21.870 --> 18:23.090
Lady Sansa.

18:25.620 --> 18:27.340
You look very handsome, my lord.

18:27.420 --> 18:28.670
Oh, yes.

18:29.130 --> 18:33.970
The husband of your dreams.
But you do look glorious.

18:39.430 --> 18:42.650
Perhaps we could
have a moment alone. Do you mind?

18:44.520 --> 18:47.940
Podrick, could you escort
Lady Stark's handmaiden?

19:03.700 --> 19:07.250
My lady, I want you to know

19:08.120 --> 19:10.000
I didn't ask for this.

19:10.590 --> 19:12.710
I hope I will not disappoint you, my lord.

19:12.800 --> 19:14.140
No, don't.

19:15.130 --> 19:17.880
You don't have to
speak to me as a prisoner anymore.

19:17.970 --> 19:21.470
You won't be
a prisoner after today. You'll be my wife.

19:22.970 --> 19:26.320
I suppose that's a
different kind of prison.

19:28.480 --> 19:30.400
I just wanted to say...

19:30.810 --> 19:33.910
I'm just trying to say, very badly...

19:35.400 --> 19:36.780
I just...

19:37.990 --> 19:40.410
Just want to say I know how you feel.

19:42.780 --> 19:45.330
I doubt that very much, my lord.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.300
You're right. I have no idea how you feel.

19:51.380 --> 19:53.840
And you have no idea how I feel.

20:01.300 --> 20:07.150
But I promise you
one thing, my lady. I won't ever hurt you.

20:11.940 --> 20:13.610
Do you drink wine?

20:15.020 --> 20:16.570
When I have to.

20:17.150 --> 20:19.150
Well, today you have to.

20:27.290 --> 20:29.250
MARGAERY: You look radiant, Your Grace.

20:30.160 --> 20:31.960
Radiant? Why radiant?

20:32.040 --> 20:33.130
It's the word that came to mind.

20:33.250 --> 20:34.380
(CHUCKLES)

20:36.130 --> 20:39.760
We're going to
be sisters soon. We should be friends.

20:40.550 --> 20:43.020
You're a musical girl, aren't you?

20:43.140 --> 20:45.610
I imagine you have a lovely voice.

20:46.010 --> 20:48.610
A better dancer than a singer, I'm afraid.

20:48.720 --> 20:51.520
But you know the song
The Rains of Castamere?

20:51.600 --> 20:54.780
Of course. They play it
so often here at court.

20:54.860 --> 20:57.860
So you know the story
of House Reyne of Castamere?

20:57.940 --> 20:59.100
Not as well as you, I'm sure.

20:59.110 --> 21:00.200
(CHUCKLES)

21:00.700 --> 21:03.870
House Reyne was
a powerful family. Very wealthy.

21:03.950 --> 21:06.250
The second wealthiest in Westeros.

21:07.030 --> 21:11.040
Aren't the Tyrells the second
wealthiest family in Westeros now?

21:11.540 --> 21:15.390
Ambitious climbers don't want to
stop on the second highest rung.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.300
If only you could take that final step,

21:18.420 --> 21:20.770
you'd see further than all the rest.

21:21.670 --> 21:25.220
You'd be alone with nothing
but blue sky above you.

21:25.300 --> 21:29.350
So Lord Reyne built a castle
as grand as Casterly Rock.

21:29.430 --> 21:33.280
He gave his wife diamonds
larger than any my mother ever wore.

21:33.850 --> 21:38.280
And finally one day,
he rebelled against my father.

21:38.900 --> 21:41.150
Do you know where House Reyne is now?

21:41.240 --> 21:42.330
Gone.

21:43.240 --> 21:44.410
Gone.

21:45.360 --> 21:48.790
A gentle word. Why not say "slaughtered"?

21:50.080 --> 21:54.580
Every man, woman, and
child put to the sword.

21:55.460 --> 21:57.680
I remember seeing their bodies hanging

21:57.790 --> 22:00.050
high above the gates of Casterly Rock.

22:00.130 --> 22:04.640
My father let them rot up there all summer.
It was a long summer.

22:05.550 --> 22:11.060
"And now the rains weep o'er their
halls, and not a soul to hear."

22:16.850 --> 22:18.980
if you ever call me "sister" again,

22:19.110 --> 22:21.230
I'll have you strangled in your sleep.

22:54.810 --> 22:56.190
Your father's gone.

22:57.230 --> 22:59.820
As the father of the realm, it is my duty

22:59.940 --> 23:02.530
to give you away to your husband.

24:25.690 --> 24:29.790
You may now cloak the bride and
bring her under your protection.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.040
we stand here in the sight of gods and men

25:23.170 --> 25:26.260
to witness the union of man and wife.

25:26.590 --> 25:31.840
One flesh,
one heart, one soul, now and forever.

25:50.320 --> 25:52.570
Have you ever seen one like it?

25:53.280 --> 25:57.280
I've never seen
anything like any of this. Not in my life.

25:57.370 --> 26:01.210
It's shocking, isn't it,
the first time you encounter real wealth?

26:01.870 --> 26:05.220
When I was your age,
I lived on one bowl of stew a day.

26:05.290 --> 26:07.840
And stew is a kind word for it.

26:08.920 --> 26:11.920
In Flea Bottom
we called them "bowls of brown."

26:13.590 --> 26:16.720
We'd pretend that
the meat in them was chicken.

26:17.390 --> 26:19.610
We knew it wasn't chicken.

26:25.900 --> 26:27.520
(WINE POURING)

26:59.010 --> 27:00.100
That's good.

27:04.180 --> 27:05.480
That's really good.

27:05.560 --> 27:07.610
Where do you think it's from?

27:08.270 --> 27:09.440
I couldn't even guess.

27:09.520 --> 27:13.490
Doesn't matter, does it?
It's the real thing or it's not.

27:13.980 --> 27:17.450
You only need a tongue
to tell the difference.

27:19.030 --> 27:20.780
Go on, have some more.

27:25.410 --> 27:28.130
(CHUCKLES) You still don't trust it.

27:28.210 --> 27:29.800
You think this is all a mistake

27:29.920 --> 27:32.220
and that you have to pay
for every bite you take.

27:32.290 --> 27:35.300
(CHUCKLES) That thought had
crossed my mind, yeah.

27:36.420 --> 27:37.640
There are no mistakes.

27:38.840 --> 27:40.220
Not for us.

27:41.300 --> 27:42.680
I'm a mistake.

27:44.640 --> 27:46.560
I'm only here because
my father grabbed my mother

27:46.600 --> 27:48.570
instead of the girl next
to her in the tavern.

27:48.640 --> 27:52.570
Your father chose your
mother because the Lord of Light willed it.

27:52.650 --> 27:55.150
He willed it so you could be here right now

27:56.150 --> 28:00.250
with a power inside you
you can't even begin to understand.

28:03.080 --> 28:07.330
And He brought me here to draw it
from you and birth it into the world.

28:10.670 --> 28:12.960
We're both a part of His plan.

28:13.920 --> 28:17.890
He wants this for us.
No, He demands this of us.

28:22.140 --> 28:24.230
I don't understand. This...

28:24.850 --> 28:26.520
This doesn't seem very religious.

28:27.180 --> 28:28.860
According to whom?

28:30.980 --> 28:32.400
The Silent Sisters?

28:32.730 --> 28:37.200
With their stern looks,
muzzled mouths, and dried-up cunts?

28:39.280 --> 28:41.700
What have their gods done for you?

28:42.200 --> 28:43.200
Mmm?

28:44.370 --> 28:47.340
When you pray to them, what's their answer?

28:47.870 --> 28:50.370
A god is real or he's not.

28:51.750 --> 28:54.090
You only need eyes to see.

28:59.050 --> 29:01.930
Death is coming for

Not there. Not there!

31:11.760 --> 31:16.520
You can blame Ser Davos. He didn't
believe in the power of king's blood.

He wanted a demonstration.

37:15.920 --> 37:17.890
There will be if I command it.

37:21.090 --> 37:25.560
Then you'll be
fucking your own bride with a wooden cock.

37:29.060 --> 37:30.680
JOFFREY: What did you say?

37:34.440 --> 37:38.360
What did you say?

37:39.400 --> 37:42.750
I believe we can
dispense with the bedding, Your Grace.

37:43.950 --> 37:47.250
I'm sure Tyrion did not mean
to threaten the King.

37:52.870 --> 37:54.920
(LAUGHING)

37:55.000 --> 37:56.920
A bad joke, Your Grace.

37:57.630 --> 38:00.930
Made out of envy of your own royal manhood.

38:02.470 --> 38:04.560
Mine is so small.

38:05.090 --> 38:08.060
My poor wife won't even know I'm there.

38:08.140 --> 38:11.020
Your uncle is clearly
quite drunk, Your Grace.

38:11.350 --> 38:12.570
TYRION: I am.

38:14.140 --> 38:15.360
Guilty.

38:16.980 --> 38:18.230
But...

38:20.400 --> 38:22.120
But it is my wedding night.

38:22.610 --> 38:26.460
My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do.

38:29.740 --> 38:31.120
Come, wife.

38:35.080 --> 38:38.380
I vomited on a girl once
in the middle of the act.

38:38.460 --> 38:40.050
Not proud of it.

38:40.460 --> 38:43.310
But I think honesty is important

38:43.470 --> 38:46.340
between a man and wife, don't you agree?

38:46.470 --> 38:50.100
Come, I'll tell you
all about it. Put you in the mood.

39:22.750 --> 39:24.760
Is that wise, my lord?

39:24.840 --> 39:26.340
Tyrion, Sansa.

39:27.680 --> 39:29.350
My name is Tyrion.

39:30.550 --> 39:32.350
Is that wise, Tyrion?

39:37.560 --> 39:39.480
Nothing was ever wiser.

39:51.370 --> 39:53.840
Astoundingly long.

Stop.

41:50.360 --> 41:51.610
I can't.

41:56.030 --> 41:57.630
I could, I won't.

41:57.740 --> 41:58.790
But your father...

41:58.870 --> 42:03.540
If my father wants someone to get
fucked, I know where he can start.

42:09.170 --> 42:10.840
I won't share your bed.

42:14.340 --> 42:16.340
Not until you want me to.

How can anyone speak 19 languages?

43:35.340 --> 43:38.470
It only took Your Grace
a year to learn Dothraki reasonably well.

43:38.550 --> 43:40.930
Yes, well, it was either learn Dothraki

43:41.100 --> 43:43.520
or grunt at my husband and hope...

43:45.270 --> 43:47.110
What do you mean, "reasonably well"?

43:48.810 --> 43:51.780
Dothraki is difficult for
the mouth to master.

43:52.270 --> 43:53.700
- So guttural and harsh.

43:53.780 --> 43:57.530

45:13.190 --> 45:15.360
What do your captains
have to say about that?

45:15.440 --> 45:17.190
You should ask them.

45:22.990 --> 45:24.040
Why?

45:24.370 --> 45:26.540
We had philosophical differences.

45:26.620 --> 45:28.000
Over what?

45:28.120 --> 45:29.210
Your beauty.

45:29.700 --> 45:32.420
It meant more to me than it did to them.

45:32.500 --> 45:33.970
You're a strange man.

I'm the simplest man you'll ever meet.

I told them I am Daario Naharis.
I always have a choice.

They drew their swords and I drew mine.

I saw him wink at me.

49:49.630 --> 49:50.760
He blinked.

49:52.590 --> 49:54.890
I suppose it's a rather
philosophical difference

between a wink and a blink.

Well, I mean, there's no real difference.

A wink is on purpose.

50:13.490 --> 50:14.830
