00:24.424 --> 00:26.949
<i>Sorry, I just can't give you
that kind of information.</i>

00:27.127 --> 00:29.618
<i>I'll do anything else.
I just can't do that.</i>

00:29.796 --> 00:32.822
<i>I can't betray my country. I won't.</i>

00:32.999 --> 00:35.729
<i>This country gave me everything.</i>

00:35.902 --> 00:38.496
<i>Oh, God. Just keep him away from me.</i>

00:38.671 --> 00:41.037
<i>Please. Don't let him near me.</i>

00:41.207 --> 00:43.368
<i>Oh, no! Oh, God!</i>

00:43.543 --> 00:46.944
<i>Come on, baby. Just relax into it.
Let Godzilla do his thing.</i>

00:48.314 --> 00:50.942
Come on. This is wrong
on so many levels. You in or not?

00:51.117 --> 00:52.243
And get cheated again?

00:52.786 --> 00:56.381
What? No, the Pooch may lie,
the Pooch may steal, the Pooch may...

00:56.556 --> 01:00.253
- Refer to himself in the third person?
- Occasionally. But the Pooch won't cheat.

01:00.427 --> 01:03.021
Well, the Pooch can relax.
I was worried about Cougar.

01:03.196 --> 01:05.255
Yeah, right. It's always the quiet ones.

01:05.432 --> 01:09.163
What? It's Blind Man's Bluff.
High card wins.

01:09.335 --> 01:10.996
How in the hell can a man cheat you?

01:12.105 --> 01:13.299
Cards.

01:17.277 --> 01:19.472
Feel like I got something here.
I got something.

01:19.646 --> 01:22.080
Queen, king, jack. Queen, king, jack.
All right.

01:22.248 --> 01:24.182
One, two, three, go.

01:34.861 --> 01:38.262
I got a great, great feeling
about this one.

01:40.967 --> 01:44.266
- Your mama had a great feeling last night.
- Oh, that was a mama joke.

01:45.805 --> 01:47.238
What? All right.

01:47.407 --> 01:49.773
- All right, let's go.
- Okay, it's a game.

01:49.943 --> 01:52.309
All right, I will raise you.

01:54.080 --> 01:55.638
- You don't wanna do that.
- Oh, no?

01:55.815 --> 01:58.079
- Got this piece off that Honduran general?
- Yes.

01:59.152 --> 02:02.212
Guess what? I'm definitely in.

02:04.290 --> 02:06.224
- Let's go.
- All right.

02:06.392 --> 02:07.416
Whoa!

02:09.062 --> 02:11.030
- Should even me up.
- How many do you have?

02:11.197 --> 02:12.391
What is going on here?

02:12.565 --> 02:13.964
Coug, it's your bet.

02:14.234 --> 02:15.565
Hey, losers!

02:17.871 --> 02:18.895
It's time.

02:35.021 --> 02:37.080
We got a drug and arms dealer
named Fadhil...

02:37.257 --> 02:41.125
...running a homegrown terrorist assembly
line out by the Madre de Dios River basin.

02:41.828 --> 02:45.764
We find it, we paint it for a laser-targeted
bomb, we get the hell out.

02:45.932 --> 02:47.194
No muss, no fuss.

02:47.734 --> 02:49.031
For that, they need us?

02:49.202 --> 02:51.864
You'd rather take on 50 dudes
with AK's?

03:06.553 --> 03:09.317
All right, I got eyes on Monsieur Fadhil.

03:09.489 --> 03:11.389
- Paint it.
- Showtime, fellas.

03:11.558 --> 03:14.459
Go ahead and call me Michelangelo.

03:15.528 --> 03:18.190
Dropkick, this is Pinball.
Request fire mission.

03:18.364 --> 03:22.061
The target is lased, and you are clear
to make a run from north to south. Over.

03:22.869 --> 03:25.133
Roger, Pinball,
target acquired and locked.

03:25.305 --> 03:28.832
Be advised, ETA fireworks,
zero eight Mikes.

03:29.008 --> 03:30.839
Roger, we'll break out the earplugs.

03:38.284 --> 03:39.546
Boss?

03:43.489 --> 03:44.820
They're using kids as mules.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.653
- Call it in.
- We have children at target site.

03:49.829 --> 03:52.889
Repeat, we have eyes on children
at target site. Please advise.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.533
<i>Acknowledged. Maintain position.</i>

03:54.701 --> 03:56.931
Maintain position?
What is he talking about?

03:57.103 --> 03:59.628
We strongly recommend cancellation
of payload delivery.

04:00.106 --> 04:02.438
<i>Your orders stand. Prep for extraction.</i>

04:04.644 --> 04:05.668
Cougar.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.909
Dropkick, this is Pinball.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.415
Equipment has suffered
catastrophic system failure.

04:12.585 --> 04:14.951
Am calling an on-site abort.

04:16.155 --> 04:18.555
<i>Well, that was just stupid.</i>

04:19.559 --> 04:20.958
Is this Mission Controller?

04:21.127 --> 04:22.719
<i>This is Max, Colonel Clay.</i>

04:23.129 --> 04:26.656
No one uses names on comms.
This is a secure military channel.

04:27.333 --> 04:28.925
<i>- Really?
- Goddamn it, listen to me.</i>

04:29.102 --> 04:30.831
There are children on site.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.835
<i>And you think I didn't know that?</i>

04:33.273 --> 04:35.707
<i>We locked coordinates
the moment you painted.</i>

04:35.875 --> 04:37.536
<i>Delivery will occur on schedule.</i>

04:37.844 --> 04:39.243
<i>- Have a super day.
- You can't...</i>

04:39.412 --> 04:42.506
Shit! Jensen, contact the plane directly.
Call an abort.

04:42.682 --> 04:45.549
I'm trying. He's jamming us.
There's nothing I can do.

04:48.354 --> 04:49.651
There's something we can do.

04:49.822 --> 04:52.086
All right, here it is.
Five against the fortress.

04:52.258 --> 04:56.285
We got maybe, what, eight minutes before
an airstrike sets the world on fire.

04:56.896 --> 04:58.090
Plenty of time.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.390
I'll drive.

05:26.726 --> 05:28.785
Us against 50 dudes with AK's, huh?

05:38.304 --> 05:41.034
Jensen, Pooch, get a truck for the kids.
Rest, out in five.

05:41.207 --> 05:45.701
- Airstrike in four and change, ladies!
- Be out in four. Rally point. On me.

05:46.979 --> 05:48.071
Three minutes to target.

06:01.294 --> 06:03.660
Come on, let's go!
Out you go. Come on, kids.

06:07.066 --> 06:10.001
- Okay, you go over here with him.
- Come on, mama. Come on.

06:11.904 --> 06:13.337
I got this. Get them out.

06:13.506 --> 06:16.942
All right, who's your papi? Let's go
this way. Let's go. Come on, let's go.

06:20.646 --> 06:22.045
Ah.

06:22.582 --> 06:23.947
- No.
- Yeah.

06:24.117 --> 06:25.243
- Really?
- Why not?

06:25.418 --> 06:26.851
- Can you?
- Of course.

06:27.019 --> 06:28.577
Okay.

06:35.027 --> 06:36.460
Ladies.

06:40.533 --> 06:41.864
Up you get. Up you get.

06:43.903 --> 06:46.394
<i>Clay, we gotthe kids.
Rally point, two minutes.</i>

06:52.178 --> 06:53.509
Max sent you, didn't he?

06:57.116 --> 06:59.107
I won't commit to his plan, he does this.

06:59.285 --> 07:03.153
I'm gonna make this real easy for you.
You let him go, I let you live.

07:05.825 --> 07:08.055
Come here, son.
Come here, son. Walk to me.

07:10.096 --> 07:11.427
Attaboy.

07:11.597 --> 07:14.566
<i>Clay, get the hell out. We gotta go, now.</i>

07:14.734 --> 07:16.201
He'll kill you too, you know.

07:23.810 --> 07:25.778
<i>Target is locked. T minus 20 seconds.</i>

07:27.647 --> 07:29.444
Oh, you stop for coffee in there?

07:36.489 --> 07:38.320
What kind of blast radius
we looking at?

07:40.526 --> 07:43.256
Okay, Pooch, I need you
to make this bus go a little faster.

07:43.429 --> 07:45.693
- Everybody, hold on to something.
- Like right now!

08:13.860 --> 08:15.157
I got it, I got it!

08:15.328 --> 08:16.522
There we go, Pooch!

08:21.868 --> 08:23.062
Whew.

08:27.940 --> 08:31.171
<i>Pinball, this is Chopper 3.
Prepare for extraction.</i>

08:33.145 --> 08:36.239
My favorite part was
when we were completely on fire.

08:36.415 --> 08:38.610
But the shootout, that was good times.

08:43.089 --> 08:44.522
There she blows.

08:45.057 --> 08:46.081
Well done.

08:46.259 --> 08:47.521
Let's go, let's go.

08:47.693 --> 08:50.526
- All right, everyone together.
- Come on, let's go.

08:50.696 --> 08:52.129
There you go. Good job.

08:53.699 --> 08:56.395
Sir, there's not enough room
for your team and them.

08:57.370 --> 08:58.962
Then it's them.

09:00.039 --> 09:01.939
- Let's go, guys.
- All right, here we go.

09:04.010 --> 09:05.102
Watch your heads.

09:13.286 --> 09:16.722
You keep your bear.
You keep him safe. Okay?

09:18.591 --> 09:20.786
Adios. Get them out of here.

09:34.273 --> 09:38.505
Those are some cute little buggers.
Hope they make it to the court martial.

09:39.011 --> 09:40.672
What is that? You hear that?

09:44.050 --> 09:46.348
Guys, this is bad.

09:46.886 --> 09:48.717
<i>Max, Cobra One, Bandit locked.</i>

09:49.822 --> 09:51.050
<i>Understood.</i>

09:51.457 --> 09:54.824
<i>Cobra One, kill Bandit.</i>

09:57.697 --> 09:58.755
No!

10:45.478 --> 10:47.207
That's supposed to be us.

10:48.748 --> 10:52.206
<i>Protests today in front of
the American Embassy, a violent response...</i>

10:52.385 --> 10:55.548
<i>...to the deaths of 25 Bolivian children
killed during the operation.</i>

10:55.721 --> 10:57.848
Let me be perfectly clear.

10:58.024 --> 11:03.257
In no way were these men acting
under orders from the U.S. government.

11:08.834 --> 11:11.234
Is there gonna be some kind
of ceremony for them?

11:16.909 --> 11:17.967
Where's the ring?

11:59.051 --> 12:01.713
<i>I love you, Mommy. You're so pretty.</i>

12:04.323 --> 12:05.347
<i>I love you, Mommy.</i>

12:28.180 --> 12:30.774
What are you doing? No, no, no!

12:31.183 --> 12:34.414
- Jeez. He's gonna get murdered.
- Come on, come on, come on.

12:41.460 --> 12:45.157
This is disgusting.
All right, I'm officially disgusted by us.

12:45.331 --> 12:47.595
- And you lost again.
- We lost again.

12:47.767 --> 12:50.167
- No, you put the bet down.
- You gave me the money.

12:51.270 --> 12:53.431
Yeah, and that was stupid of me,
wasn't it?

12:55.808 --> 12:59.039
I mean, could this get any more sleazy?

13:03.649 --> 13:05.810
I suppose if we started drinking.

13:05.985 --> 13:07.577
You're not...? You're not drinking?

13:12.858 --> 13:14.223
Come on, get him in there!

13:24.837 --> 13:25.861
Thank you.

13:31.610 --> 13:34.670
I found a guy online who says
he can trade intel on Max for cash.

13:34.847 --> 13:37.748
- All we gotta do is make a little money.
- We don't have money.

13:37.917 --> 13:42.217
We're gonna go PayPal-ing some kid
in a basement who's most likely lying?

13:42.388 --> 13:44.652
You were there.
You know the man tried to kill us.

13:44.824 --> 13:47.224
The man did kill us, Clay.

13:48.828 --> 13:52.730
No, we gotta stay focused. All right?
On the mission.

13:52.898 --> 13:58.029
Get money, get clean passports, get back
to stateside without anybody noticing.

13:58.204 --> 14:00.866
- Didn't even see what he looks like.
- We heard his voice.

14:01.040 --> 14:03.338
A man with a voice
is a man with a throat.

14:03.509 --> 14:05.443
Come on. Clay, just look around you.

14:05.611 --> 14:09.843
Do you think we're in a position
to actually take on some CIA super spook?

14:10.015 --> 14:11.414
- Roque.
- It's a hell of a plan.

14:11.584 --> 14:14.576
You know what? Pooch can set up
over there by the taco stand.

14:14.753 --> 14:17.517
Jensen can set up communications
right there by the hookers.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.487
- Captain.
- Yo! Yo.

14:19.658 --> 14:22.559
You're not a soldier anymore.

14:23.229 --> 14:25.629
You're not a soldier. All right?

14:27.766 --> 14:30.701
Clay, for chrissakes,
you're losing the men.

14:33.005 --> 14:36.873
- The men are fine.
- Yeah, well, you're losing me. All right?

14:37.776 --> 14:41.109
He won, we lost. Just get us home.

14:44.483 --> 14:46.144
Can you do that?

15:54.286 --> 15:56.151
How's your steak?

15:57.089 --> 15:58.488
Meaty.

16:02.261 --> 16:03.990
You want a bite?

16:06.098 --> 16:07.998
Maybe later.

16:10.302 --> 16:12.167
Okay.

16:22.014 --> 16:23.504
Do I know you?

16:23.916 --> 16:25.975
Relax, Papi.

16:29.722 --> 16:31.519
Do I not look relaxed?

16:33.158 --> 16:34.182
No.

16:39.531 --> 16:41.499
Think we can change that?

16:47.873 --> 16:51.536
Wow, it's everything a girl can dream of.

16:55.514 --> 16:56.572
Do you have a bathroom?

16:56.749 --> 16:59.684
No, I specifically requested
the only hotel room in the world...

16:59.852 --> 17:01.319
...that doesn't have a bathroom.

17:01.887 --> 17:04.947
Are you trying to turn a yes into a no?

17:05.624 --> 17:07.717
Oh. Thank you.

17:16.935 --> 17:18.800
So, what brings you to Bolivia?

17:19.371 --> 17:20.929
Cruise ship.

17:21.106 --> 17:23.370
We're a landlocked country.

17:23.542 --> 17:25.806
Well, it's an amazing cruise ship.

17:32.084 --> 17:33.483
Where were we now?

17:36.588 --> 17:38.749
Well, I think you were about to tell me...

17:39.525 --> 17:41.152
...how you enjoy following me.

17:42.327 --> 17:44.090
You saw me, didn't you?

17:44.263 --> 17:45.355
I did.

17:46.932 --> 17:49.423
I bet you didn't see me
on Mercado Street.

17:54.873 --> 17:56.932
I have a business proposition
for you, Clay.

17:57.109 --> 17:59.441
Oops. What happened to your accent?

18:00.579 --> 18:01.671
Oops.

18:06.985 --> 18:08.145
I don't wanna hurt you.

18:08.320 --> 18:10.845
- You're not going to.
- Oh, yes, I am.

19:16.155 --> 19:18.316
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:41.914 --> 19:43.142
What do you want?

19:43.649 --> 19:45.139
I can help you find Max.

19:46.652 --> 19:48.449
I'm listening.

20:00.832 --> 20:02.299
How did you know we were alive?

20:02.467 --> 20:04.935
I counted the number of teeth
in the chopper wreckage.

20:05.904 --> 20:08.372
Plus you guys aren't exactly subtle.

20:09.241 --> 20:12.836
Here's the deal.
I get you and your men back in the States.

20:13.011 --> 20:14.876
In exchange, you get Max for me.

20:15.047 --> 20:18.244
- What's the catch, lady?
- It's pretty much a suicide mission.

20:19.952 --> 20:22.113
Why should I trust you?

20:22.854 --> 20:26.483
Because if I were lying, I wouldn't have
used the words "suicide mission."

20:30.862 --> 20:33.228
Just meet me here tomorrow.

20:34.266 --> 20:36.291
And bring your boys.

20:36.468 --> 20:38.493
- Goodbye.
- Hey.

20:41.974 --> 20:45.501
If you're lying to me, I'll kill you.

20:46.545 --> 20:48.240
It was nice meeting you too.

20:48.580 --> 20:50.639
Yes, it was.

21:10.302 --> 21:13.135
I'm sorry we're late.
There was a party at the doll factory.

21:13.538 --> 21:14.766
It was Pepito's birthday.

21:14.973 --> 21:16.565
- Really?
- Yeah.

21:22.381 --> 21:25.214
So she wanted to meet in a cemetery.

21:25.384 --> 21:28.046
Because that's not,
like, foreboding at all.

21:28.553 --> 21:30.987
- Am I the only one that sees this shirt?
- No.

21:32.357 --> 21:33.824
Oh, it's my niece's soccer team.

21:33.992 --> 21:37.484
Eight and under.
I checked their scores online and I...

21:38.263 --> 21:39.730
What?

21:40.332 --> 21:42.562
They're in the playoffs.

21:43.335 --> 21:44.996
What do you have on her?

21:45.370 --> 21:47.395
Besides a pant-busting crush?

21:48.173 --> 21:49.970
Her company file is blank.

21:50.142 --> 21:54.772
CIA has a standing kill order on her.
As does Hamas, Sinn F?n.

21:54.980 --> 21:58.472
Pretty much everyone with the exception of
PETA wants this chick amscrayed.

21:59.651 --> 22:03.644
You thinking clear on this? Because every
time you mess up, it's because of a woman.

22:03.822 --> 22:05.380
- Name one time that I...
- Amber.

22:05.590 --> 22:09.082
- Amber's husband was the problem.
- Her husband wasn't the one who shot you.

22:09.261 --> 22:10.853
- Only in the leg.
- What about Emma?

22:11.029 --> 22:14.795
- Doesn't count. I didn't sleep with Emma.
- Because she put a bomb in your car!

22:14.966 --> 22:18.493
I admit, that did take a little of
the romance out of the relationship.

22:18.670 --> 22:22.003
Yeah. And now this chick shows up and...
What's her name, Aisha?

22:22.174 --> 22:25.666
And well, she burns down our hotel.

22:25.844 --> 22:27.106
I'm clear, Roque.

22:27.279 --> 22:30.544
Well, you better be,
because I ain't getting killed by no girl.

22:30.716 --> 22:33.446
It's been a long time
since anyone called me a girl.

22:37.956 --> 22:40.117
She put a bomb in your car?

22:40.325 --> 22:41.417
She was volatile.

22:42.094 --> 22:46.463
Aisha, this is Jensen,
Pooch, Roque, Cougar.

22:47.232 --> 22:48.392
Really? Heh.

22:51.303 --> 22:55.865
Gentlemen, in 97 hours,
Max will be in Miami.

22:56.041 --> 22:59.204
He travels in an armored column
with at least 30 private security...

22:59.378 --> 23:01.039
...armed to the teeth.

23:01.213 --> 23:03.841
You have a better shot
at kidnapping the president.

23:05.584 --> 23:09.452
Good news for you is I have the power
to get you guys back in the U. S...

23:09.621 --> 23:12.351
...and fund the entire op as you see fit.

23:12.524 --> 23:14.515
You get Max and we're square.

23:14.693 --> 23:17.628
And why should we believe you?

23:18.897 --> 23:22.389
Because I'm the first person you've met
who even admits he exists.

23:23.935 --> 23:26.995
Listen, you guys can all stay here
in Bolivia and rot.

23:27.172 --> 23:30.141
Or you can go home and get revenge
on the man that framed you.

23:30.642 --> 23:32.166
It's your choice.

23:33.011 --> 23:34.308
Colonel?

23:35.080 --> 23:37.275
Don't call me that.
We're not soldiers anymore.

23:37.449 --> 23:39.246
Okay, you know that if we do this...

23:39.418 --> 23:42.581
...we are waging a war
against the Central Intelligence Agency.

23:44.122 --> 23:45.885
They started it.

23:55.267 --> 23:56.666
Okay, here's what I'm hearing.

23:56.835 --> 24:01.295
I'm hearing, "No." I'm hearing, "Leave."
I'm hearing, "I'm sorry."

24:01.473 --> 24:05.102
- Is that what I'm hearing?
- We cannot do what you ask. I'm sorry!

24:05.277 --> 24:08.769
Tell me, Nabil, is this a moral issue
or a financial issue?

24:08.947 --> 24:10.039
- A moral issue.
- Really?

24:10.482 --> 24:12.814
You morally object to this deal?

24:12.984 --> 24:16.818
- Yes, I'm sorry. Please, leave.
- Okay, so that is what I'm hearing.

24:16.988 --> 24:19.980
Now I want you to listen to me,
listen carefully...

24:20.158 --> 24:21.819
...because I want you to hear this.

24:22.294 --> 24:23.556
Wade?

24:28.300 --> 24:30.029
What is this? What are you doing?

24:31.236 --> 24:32.601
No, please!

24:43.348 --> 24:45.578
What the hell was that?

24:46.051 --> 24:47.575
You gave me the nod.

24:47.752 --> 24:50.983
A hit-him-in-the-face nod,
not a throw-him-off-the-roof nod.

24:53.258 --> 24:55.419
- I thought that's what you wanted.
- At most...

24:55.594 --> 24:57.721
...at most,
that was a break-his-fingers nod.

24:57.896 --> 25:01.297
Jesus, Wade.
The man was a scientific genius.

25:01.500 --> 25:05.630
Granted, his weight signaled certain
impulse-control issues...

25:06.371 --> 25:10.364
...but that's no reason
to throw his fat ass off 57 floors.

25:10.575 --> 25:12.202
Sorry.

25:14.145 --> 25:19.742
I think I speak for everyone here
when I say your actions were excessive.

25:19.918 --> 25:23.410
And yes, more than just a little wasteful.

25:26.358 --> 25:29.191
But then, it does seem
to have had the desired effect.

25:29.361 --> 25:32.524
- I'll tell you what, throw baldy off next.
- No, please. Wait.

25:33.665 --> 25:36.600
We have a different moral perspective
than our late colleague.

25:37.102 --> 25:39.502
I need one to test and four to use.

25:39.671 --> 25:41.229
Four snukes?

25:41.606 --> 25:43.039
We would need much money.

25:46.411 --> 25:48.811
You will have much money.

26:29.854 --> 26:32.152
Welcome back to the land of the living.

26:37.362 --> 26:38.761
How do you wanna begin?

26:39.864 --> 26:41.855
We're gonna go bird hunting.

27:30.582 --> 27:34.177
It's a sonic de-materializer.
Better known as a snuke.

27:34.719 --> 27:37.517
For the 21st-century green terrorist.

27:38.023 --> 27:39.354
Pure destruction.

27:40.058 --> 27:41.719
No pollution.

27:46.431 --> 27:48.262
So who are we selling them to?

27:49.200 --> 27:51.634
Chinese extremists, PLF,
the frigging French Basques.

27:51.803 --> 27:54.829
As long as they have the right price
and are willing to use it.

27:55.006 --> 27:57.167
No stockpiling, no deterrence.

27:57.342 --> 28:00.402
It's like giving a handgun
to a 6-year-old, Wade.

28:00.578 --> 28:02.239
You don't know how it's gonna end...

28:02.414 --> 28:05.281
...but you're pretty sure
it's gonna make the papers.

28:05.984 --> 28:07.008
Another war.

28:07.218 --> 28:09.686
Well, what do you believe in, Wade?

28:09.854 --> 28:12.846
I'm guessing shotguns and big titties.

28:13.024 --> 28:15.356
I also enjoy air shows and beer.

28:19.631 --> 28:20.893
We're saving the country...

28:21.066 --> 28:24.160
...doing something for the benefit of
the United States of America.

28:24.335 --> 28:26.303
I was born in Quebec.

28:26.805 --> 28:30.138
Okay. Then we're saving North America.

28:32.944 --> 28:35.276
Oops. Sorry.

28:39.184 --> 28:41.311
Let me have your weapon, Wade.

29:20.125 --> 29:22.320
Base 1, this is Cavalier 415!

29:22.494 --> 29:25.429
We've been in a collision
with a civilian vehicle.

29:25.597 --> 29:27.929
Carvey's dead
and Freeman's hurt real bad.

29:28.099 --> 29:30.329
We need medevac immediately.

29:30.502 --> 29:32.561
He's got kids, Base 1, he's got kids!

29:34.205 --> 29:36.036
That sucked.

29:36.207 --> 29:39.142
<i>- Roger, Cavalier 415.
- Come on, Jensen. You're better than that.</i>

29:39.310 --> 29:42.040
<i>- Scrambling a chopper. Hang in there.
- He's got kids.</i>

29:42.213 --> 29:43.612
So contrived.

29:43.782 --> 29:45.750
I used to be good at that. Right, Roque?

29:45.950 --> 29:47.315
- Shut up.
- Thanks, man.

29:48.319 --> 29:49.650
Robert De Niro who?

29:49.854 --> 29:52.322
- Jensen, shut up.
- You shut up, Roque.

29:52.490 --> 29:55.687
You're dead. I'm spinal injury.
Spinal injury can talk. Dead can't.

29:55.860 --> 29:57.919
Stop talking or I'll break your neck really.

29:58.096 --> 30:00.462
You really gotta start getting
into character.

30:00.632 --> 30:03.328
I'm serious, man. Dead guy, no talking.

30:05.670 --> 30:06.762
All right.

30:08.773 --> 30:13.267
Base 1, this is Medvac Delta.
We have visual on Cavalier 415.

30:13.812 --> 30:16.007
Here we go.

30:25.356 --> 30:27.347
Buddy, we'll get you patched up
in no time.

30:27.525 --> 30:29.823
Oh, my God. Hi.

30:29.994 --> 30:31.359
What's your name?

30:32.330 --> 30:34.059
<i>Fire when ready, Cougar.</i>

30:35.433 --> 30:36.832
Ow.

30:38.736 --> 30:41.864
- Oh, shit.
- What the hell's going on?

30:49.214 --> 30:50.613
Woo-hoo.

30:53.551 --> 30:55.951
You've just been chopper-jacked, fellas.

31:04.596 --> 31:05.858
Where's my wild goose?

31:06.030 --> 31:07.998
The GPS?

31:09.100 --> 31:10.533
Got it!

31:15.039 --> 31:17.200
Have you ever seen an EMT
look like this?

31:17.375 --> 31:19.400
Really, bro? "Hi, what's your name?

31:19.577 --> 31:21.408
I have no legs,
but I wanna take you on a date"?

31:24.349 --> 31:25.680
Yo, J.

31:26.284 --> 31:29.685
What do you think is up with all this
"Don't call me colonel" stuff?

31:29.854 --> 31:31.754
It's classic loss of identity.

31:31.923 --> 31:34.585
Clay defined himself by his place
in military structure...

31:34.759 --> 31:36.750
...his way of measuring the good he did.

31:36.928 --> 31:40.887
Without it, he's just another loser
like the rest of us.

31:41.432 --> 31:43.866
You know cats can make
a thousand different sounds...

31:44.035 --> 31:45.525
...and dogs can only make ten?

31:46.938 --> 31:51.500
Cats. Not to be trusted.

31:51.676 --> 31:53.837
Okay, do me a favor
and never repeat that.

31:54.012 --> 31:55.673
Okay? We're all set.

31:58.683 --> 32:02.414
Ready to take a giant step for...

32:02.587 --> 32:04.919
...guys who like to steal stuff, I guess.

32:05.356 --> 32:07.654
- Hit it.
- Showtime.

32:12.030 --> 32:13.327
Beautiful.

32:14.599 --> 32:16.624
- Now, that's a rocket!
- Let them chase that.

32:16.834 --> 32:17.858
That is a rocket!

32:18.036 --> 32:19.298
- Wow, shit!
- Did you see that?

32:19.470 --> 32:21.028
<i>Medevac Delta, this is Base 1.</i>

32:21.205 --> 32:23.935
- Oh, my God.
- I'm the black MacGyver. BlaGyver.

32:24.108 --> 32:26.474
<i>- What's your situation? Over.
- Time to move.</i>

32:59.243 --> 33:00.403
Hi.

33:06.918 --> 33:08.749
Where you from originally?

33:10.722 --> 33:12.053
The wilds of Northern Africa.

33:12.523 --> 33:14.855
Wow, so that must've been...

33:20.231 --> 33:22.529
...sandy.

33:26.938 --> 33:28.599
Do you have any hobbies?

33:29.640 --> 33:32.473
When I was little, I collected human ears.

33:34.078 --> 33:35.477
Good times.

33:37.949 --> 33:39.041
But it's...

33:50.895 --> 33:53.056
No, no, no, my friend, listen.

33:53.231 --> 33:56.098
A gas turbine generator
running a force-fed rectifier unit.

33:56.300 --> 33:59.360
Hook it up to the fuel tank
and... we're in the game.

33:59.537 --> 34:03.200
There are few things in life that liberal
application of duct tape can't solve.

34:03.674 --> 34:05.904
Are small arms gonna be a problem?

34:06.277 --> 34:08.472
It's taken care of. Thanks.

34:09.447 --> 34:12.439
Which brings me to my question, Aisha.

34:12.617 --> 34:14.778
- What do you want with Max?
- Roque.

34:14.952 --> 34:16.943
No. She did her part.

34:17.321 --> 34:18.788
All right?

34:18.956 --> 34:21.948
We got home.
I mean, we could walk right now.

34:22.126 --> 34:24.321
- You can, but we made a deal.
- Fuck deals, okay?

34:24.495 --> 34:25.689
You made a deal with Clay.

34:28.132 --> 34:29.565
I want answers.

34:35.673 --> 34:39.074
Max is trying
to buy next-generation weapons.

34:39.243 --> 34:40.505
I don't know the endgame.

34:41.245 --> 34:44.908
What I do know is when Max takes
an interest in something, people die...

34:45.083 --> 34:46.482
...and world maps get redrawn.

34:46.651 --> 34:50.018
Bullshit. Do you really think
you could take him on, little girl?

34:50.188 --> 34:52.952
No, big boy. You are.

34:53.124 --> 34:55.684
I think I'm just gonna kill her
right now, Clay.

34:55.860 --> 34:58.351
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

34:58.529 --> 35:02.260
I'm right here. You wanna shoot
your bankroll, go right ahead.

35:04.335 --> 35:05.529
Roque.

35:06.838 --> 35:08.135
Roque.

35:12.243 --> 35:15.076
Okay, you stay with us,
but if anything smells like a trap...

35:15.246 --> 35:19.239
...I get to put a bullet in your skull.
Does that sound fair?

35:19.417 --> 35:20.975
That sounds fun.

35:22.587 --> 35:23.986
Sounds like my parents.

35:25.556 --> 35:28.684
- I knew you weren't gonna shoot her.
- Not today.

35:35.433 --> 35:37.367
Southwest perimeter secure.

35:43.374 --> 35:44.398
Load and go.

35:45.543 --> 35:48.171
That's the prize. That's where Max is.

35:48.346 --> 35:52.407
Yeah, I sure hope he doesn't see us
in this bright yellow banana Pinto.

35:52.650 --> 35:56.051
Trying to say that you're embarrassed
to be seen in an American classic?

35:56.220 --> 35:57.847
This is an American classic?

35:59.590 --> 36:00.921
All right.

36:01.259 --> 36:02.556
Here we go.

36:02.727 --> 36:04.695
Let's see what you got.

36:10.001 --> 36:11.468
Good shot.

36:12.503 --> 36:14.164
Clay, where are the seatbelts, bro?

36:14.372 --> 36:17.967
We don't need seatbelts.
The G-forces will hold you in your seat.

36:20.211 --> 36:21.303
<i>Jensen, are we wired?</i>

36:22.046 --> 36:23.070
Max is westbound.

36:25.850 --> 36:28.114
And these hot dogs are delicious.

36:34.292 --> 36:37.125
- This is not a sweet car, dog.
- This is a classic.

36:37.295 --> 36:40.059
Yeah, this is a classic piece of shit.

37:16.867 --> 37:19.131
Come on, back up! Move that car!

37:19.303 --> 37:20.964
Lead vehicle hit. Give me the exits.

37:21.138 --> 37:23.299
<i>Northbound and southbound are blocked.</i>

37:23.474 --> 37:24.566
<i>We're trying to clear now.</i>

37:24.742 --> 37:26.232
Dismount.

37:27.812 --> 37:30.280
Form a defensive perimeter
around the package.

37:41.659 --> 37:43.456
This will wake them up.

37:46.430 --> 37:47.522
Masks on!

38:06.917 --> 38:08.214
Oh, shit.

38:10.554 --> 38:11.680
Pooch?

38:12.623 --> 38:15.990
Open fire! Shoot it down now!

38:17.328 --> 38:18.659
All right, here we go.

38:33.978 --> 38:35.809
Goddamn.

38:37.515 --> 38:39.676
We are under attack. We need backup.

38:46.023 --> 38:48.218
All right, easy. Go to your right now.

38:49.627 --> 38:51.993
All right, ease down, ease down,
to your left.

38:52.163 --> 38:54.063
No, no, your other left. Easy, easy.

38:54.231 --> 38:55.664
- Can you let me do this?
- Sure.

38:55.833 --> 38:56.891
Can you let me do this?

39:01.172 --> 39:04.369
That's right, bitches. I got a crossbow.

39:06.544 --> 39:08.444
<i>Backdoor is sealed. Take him up.</i>

39:22.426 --> 39:23.893
Get out of my way!

39:34.739 --> 39:36.172
Whoa!

39:38.609 --> 39:42.739
- You said small arms weren't a problem.
- Does that look like small arms to you, huh?

39:42.913 --> 39:46.144
- He has a cannon down there.
- Doughnut. Doughnut, doughnut, doughnut!

39:52.656 --> 39:53.850
Shit!

39:55.893 --> 39:57.224
Sure you've done this before?

39:57.395 --> 40:02.059
Okay, right now, not the time.
Not the time right now.

40:02.233 --> 40:03.894
Pooch, what's your status?

40:04.068 --> 40:08.437
Completely irritated and possibly crashing,
but fish is on the hook.

40:08.639 --> 40:10.300
We got Max.

40:10.474 --> 40:11.532
Barely.

40:27.825 --> 40:32.194
Fellas. You're not gonna believe this shit.
Wade was there.

40:32.363 --> 40:33.625
Wade Travis, 7th Group?

40:33.831 --> 40:34.889
He made me, Clay.

40:35.332 --> 40:36.629
No question.

40:36.801 --> 40:39.065
- Who's he?
- Ran counter-guerrilla ops with him.

40:39.236 --> 40:41.761
Just say he's a bad man.

40:42.640 --> 40:44.164
I thought you guys were bad men.

40:44.341 --> 40:47.310
- He's worse. - All right,
but right now, we need to deal...

40:47.478 --> 40:50.504
...with the heavily armed evil genius
inside this truck.

40:50.681 --> 40:51.943
Come on.

40:52.116 --> 40:53.606
You ready?

40:57.455 --> 40:59.047
Open the valve.

41:01.692 --> 41:03.353
All right, let's unlock this thing.

41:09.433 --> 41:10.832
Hit the ground!

41:11.602 --> 41:13.763
Hit the ground or I'll blow your head off!

41:14.071 --> 41:15.538
Yeah, I don't think so.

41:15.706 --> 41:17.298
First and final warning.

41:17.641 --> 41:20.474
Gasoline, muzzle flash, think about it.

41:24.148 --> 41:25.479
Put them down.

41:32.690 --> 41:33.952
Coug.

41:35.192 --> 41:37.490
- Where is he?
- Who?

41:38.128 --> 41:39.493
Max.

41:40.898 --> 41:41.922
Who the hell is Max?

41:45.102 --> 41:46.694
- I can explain.
- Shut up.

41:48.405 --> 41:49.429
Jensen, open it.

41:58.883 --> 41:59.907
It's a hard drive...

42:00.084 --> 42:04.578
...from Goliath, the multinational
manufacturer of everything.

42:06.290 --> 42:07.484
I'm completely locked out.

42:07.658 --> 42:11.287
Without a decryption key,
you're looking at a really cool paperweight.

42:19.803 --> 42:21.794
Shoot her. Burn everything.

42:22.239 --> 42:25.037
- Don't you wanna find out what's on it?
- No.

42:25.676 --> 42:27.075
I can't find Max.

42:28.712 --> 42:30.236
Nobody can.

42:30.414 --> 42:34.714
But I knew that he was moving something
that was very valuable to him.

42:34.885 --> 42:36.147
Clay!

42:36.554 --> 42:40.820
Whatever it is, we can use it against him.
It's leverage!

42:40.991 --> 42:43.960
The drive is proprietary technology
built by Goliath.

42:44.128 --> 42:46.688
The algorithm's probably
on the mainframe.

42:51.135 --> 42:54.070
- Come on. We're not considering that.
- Wait, wait, wait.

42:54.238 --> 42:57.571
Oh, no, come on, man.
We're not the good guys anymore.

42:57.741 --> 42:59.572
Twenty-five kids.

43:00.177 --> 43:03.078
Twenty-five innocent lives lost
because of this guy. Remember?

43:03.247 --> 43:04.271
- I do.
- You were there.

43:04.448 --> 43:05.847
Yeah, I was there.

43:06.584 --> 43:08.745
- Max is gonna pay.
- Is this a guilt trip?

43:08.919 --> 43:11.217
No, I don't want him to pay.
I want my life back.

43:11.388 --> 43:15.290
Okay? My life back.
Enough of this revenge bullshit.

43:15.960 --> 43:19.623
- I'm killing her right now. - You
don't like the way I'm running things...

43:20.030 --> 43:21.998
...you can find the door.

43:22.166 --> 43:23.599
And go where, Clay?

43:23.767 --> 43:25.394
Huh? Go where?

43:26.070 --> 43:29.267
We're fugitives. Because of you.

43:29.773 --> 43:31.673
What the hell are
you gonna do next, huh?

43:31.842 --> 43:34.777
Put us in a box, because you got beat
by a guy on a radio?

43:34.945 --> 43:36.845
- Hey, whoa.
- Okay, all right, all right.

43:37.047 --> 43:39.379
- Cool out, cool out.
- You shouldn't have done that.

43:39.550 --> 43:41.643
- I did do it.
- You shouldn't have done that.

43:41.852 --> 43:43.376
I'm gonna cut your head off, man.

43:44.221 --> 43:45.552
Bring it!

43:45.756 --> 43:47.519
- Hey, get off!
- Roque.

43:47.725 --> 43:50.785
They know we're alive, Roque.

43:51.795 --> 43:54.889
Only thing we have to use against them
right now is that drive.

43:56.467 --> 43:59.436
She framed us. Are you guys blind?
She framed us!

44:00.537 --> 44:02.801
We hit Goliath Worldwide headquarters
in two days.

44:03.007 --> 44:06.465
You want your life back?
You're gonna have to steal it.

44:06.677 --> 44:08.872
You're wrong, you know that, right?

44:09.046 --> 44:10.946
- Again because of a woman!
- Cut her loose.

44:11.882 --> 44:13.349
Cut her loose.

44:13.851 --> 44:15.182
Cut her loose, Roque.

44:15.586 --> 44:17.076
You cut her loose, bro.

44:22.960 --> 44:24.655
This is on you.

44:43.547 --> 44:45.276
<i>We're all set, sir.</i>

44:45.449 --> 44:46.746
Commence.

44:46.917 --> 44:49.283
<i>- Code.
- Pulsar.</i>

44:51.722 --> 44:52.984
What's pulsar?

44:54.358 --> 44:56.349
What do you know about
deep space tachyons?

44:57.461 --> 44:58.587
Nothing.

45:00.397 --> 45:02.661
- Base-particle string theory?
- Nothing.

45:02.866 --> 45:04.561
Singularity events?

45:04.735 --> 45:05.963
Not a ton.

45:07.805 --> 45:09.932
I think we should move on, then.

45:17.681 --> 45:22.277
I'm gonna give you 45 seconds to explain
what happened to my drive.

45:27.791 --> 45:30.089
And who am I looking at here, Wade?

45:30.961 --> 45:32.223
Clay and his unit.

45:32.429 --> 45:36.331
Clay and his unit?
That sounds like a porno, Wade.

45:36.500 --> 45:38.297
You had them killed four months ago.

45:38.469 --> 45:40.562
I've done a lot in four months, Wade.

45:40.738 --> 45:42.000
I'm a very busy man.

45:42.172 --> 45:43.764
The Bolivia situation?

45:43.974 --> 45:44.998
Fadhil.

45:45.175 --> 45:46.802
The Max intel Fadhil gathered...

45:47.177 --> 45:49.771
Was incinerated along
with everything else in the blast.

45:49.980 --> 45:51.242
These guys survived.

45:51.849 --> 45:53.146
And they have my drive.

45:53.617 --> 45:55.016
Yeah.

45:56.019 --> 45:58.886
Okay, so five dead men
hijacked you, Wade.

45:59.056 --> 46:01.354
Did you happen to find out
who's behind them?

46:01.625 --> 46:05.322
- Not the CIA, NSA, special ops.
- Yeah, I'm aware it's not us.

46:06.497 --> 46:10.399
Seems like the only thing we do know is
who they're coming after.

46:14.905 --> 46:18.932
Get me an 18-man fire team in 12 hours.

46:20.310 --> 46:22.574
- What's the plan?
- What's the plan?

46:22.746 --> 46:25.977
The plan is get me
an 18-man fire team in 12 hours.

46:26.150 --> 46:28.710
- Okay.
- Are we clear on the plan?

46:28.886 --> 46:31.081
Or we could do it a third time.

46:31.789 --> 46:33.381
- Clear.
- Good.

46:33.991 --> 46:36.721
Oh, Wade, you know what I was thinking?
I forgot earlier.

46:36.894 --> 46:40.125
Get me an 18-man fire team in 12 hours.

46:40.764 --> 46:42.231
Are we clear?

47:07.524 --> 47:09.014
Do you want some?

47:47.264 --> 47:48.891
Pooch has a wife.

47:50.267 --> 47:52.167
Jensen has a niece.

47:53.570 --> 47:57.904
When all this is over and they go home
to their families, what are you gonna do?

48:00.210 --> 48:02.235
I'll think of something.

48:03.714 --> 48:07.172
They'll never let you be a soldier again.
You know that, right?

48:12.189 --> 48:15.386
- You have no one, do you?
- Do you?

48:18.962 --> 48:20.657
I got Roque.

48:25.802 --> 48:27.201
You know...

48:27.804 --> 48:30.364
...if you two really fought...

48:31.275 --> 48:32.435
...he would kill you.

48:35.779 --> 48:37.178
Why's that?

48:37.781 --> 48:39.373
Because of the others.

48:41.118 --> 48:42.745
You care what happens to them.

48:44.087 --> 48:45.554
And you think that's a weakness?

48:46.356 --> 48:47.823
I know it is.

48:48.959 --> 48:50.324
It's the law of the jungle.

48:50.527 --> 48:52.620
Well, thankfully, we're not in the jungle.

48:52.796 --> 48:54.320
Yes, we are.

49:30.767 --> 49:31.791
Good morning.

49:34.771 --> 49:35.795
Oh, wow.

49:35.973 --> 49:39.170
That's just peachy.

49:39.343 --> 49:40.469
All right, look.

49:40.644 --> 49:43.909
We're not going anywhere
until you two squash this bullshit.

49:44.081 --> 49:46.072
- We are on a schedule here. Let's go.
- Yeah.

49:46.249 --> 49:48.843
Oh, we're on a schedule. Okay.

49:50.520 --> 49:51.646
What are you doing?

49:58.192 --> 49:59.318
Roque...

50:01.795 --> 50:03.854
...I'm sorry I hit you in the face.

50:05.632 --> 50:08.100
That was good. That was good. Roque?

50:08.902 --> 50:10.233
Roque?

50:10.437 --> 50:13.702
Clay, I'm sorry I threatened
to cut your head off.

50:13.874 --> 50:16.502
Very good. Wow.

50:17.277 --> 50:19.108
Don't you two feel so much better?

50:19.780 --> 50:20.804
- No.
- No.

50:20.981 --> 50:23.381
I don't give a shit, because I do.

50:23.584 --> 50:27.281
Now, I say we go watch Jensen
get himself killed. Yup?

50:38.465 --> 50:41.457
<i>A singer in a smoky room</i>

50:42.669 --> 50:46.070
<i>Smell of wine and cheap perfume</i>

50:46.440 --> 50:49.341
<i>For a smile they can share the night</i>

50:49.510 --> 50:54.072
<i>It goes on and on
And on and on</i>

50:54.248 --> 50:57.775
<i>Strangers waiting</i>

50:59.253 --> 51:01.585
<i>Up and down the boulevard</i>

51:10.063 --> 51:11.792
<i>Goliath Worldwide Enterprises.</i>

51:11.965 --> 51:12.989
Mr. Anderson, please.

51:13.167 --> 51:16.796
<i>Mr. Frank Anderson, Human Resources.
One moment, please.</i>

51:22.376 --> 51:23.400
Wow.

51:25.946 --> 51:29.143
Liking the angle of the dangle? Heh.

51:29.316 --> 51:31.784
- Mm.
- Nice.

51:34.855 --> 51:35.879
This is Anderson.

51:36.056 --> 51:38.786
Mr. Anderson, this is Richard Hertz
from Internal Security.

51:38.959 --> 51:41.257
I'm wondering if you'd make your way
to the lobby.

51:41.428 --> 51:42.520
<i>What is this about?</i>

51:42.729 --> 51:45.459
Well, it's a matter of somewhat
sensitive nature...

51:45.632 --> 51:49.227
...involving an individual exposing himself
to women in the elevator.

51:49.403 --> 51:51.667
Nasty business, really.
Best discussed in person.

51:51.872 --> 51:53.339
All right. I'm on my way.

51:53.507 --> 51:55.202
I'll see you there.

52:02.649 --> 52:04.207
Thank you.

52:10.424 --> 52:11.755
Hi.

52:11.925 --> 52:15.622
I'm Skippy from Tech Support, here to
install the firewall on Anderson's system.

52:15.796 --> 52:19.459
You just missed him. But if you want,
you can come back in, like, an hour?

52:19.633 --> 52:22.158
I could be out in minutes.
He doesn't have to be there.

52:22.336 --> 52:24.395
- You can't go in.
- Upstairs is riding me.

52:24.605 --> 52:28.166
- But you can't... Sir...
- Thank you, I appreciate it. I like your dress.

52:30.377 --> 52:31.708
Dress?

52:32.746 --> 52:33.838
Too much.

52:36.483 --> 52:37.882
Algorithm's on the mainframe.

52:43.156 --> 52:45.021
Downloading it now.

52:48.629 --> 52:51.598
- Skippy?
- Hey! Shit.

52:51.765 --> 52:53.790
- Really?
- Oh, ho, wow.

52:55.502 --> 52:57.697
Look, I know this probably doesn't look...

53:05.178 --> 53:06.611
Clay, I need an exit!

53:06.780 --> 53:10.181
<i>Circle around the north
side of the building. You'll have cover.</i>

53:21.161 --> 53:22.628
Freeze!

53:23.063 --> 53:24.758
Wow, this got serious.

53:33.407 --> 53:35.102
I'm warning you.

53:35.309 --> 53:40.303
I am a lethal killing machine.
It was a secret government experiment.

53:40.480 --> 53:45.281
They did stuff to me. Spooky stuff.

53:46.987 --> 53:48.648
Anal stuff.

53:49.056 --> 53:52.025
Turned me into a dangerous telekinetic.

53:52.960 --> 53:55.656
As the ancient Tibetan philosophy states:

53:56.196 --> 54:00.098
"Don't start none, won't be none."

54:10.744 --> 54:12.575
Telekinetic your way out of this.

54:13.447 --> 54:14.539
- Pow.
- Ah!

54:16.316 --> 54:17.840
- Poof.
- Argh!

54:22.623 --> 54:26.821
Face down, or I'll make your heart
stop beating with my mind.

54:32.466 --> 54:33.490
Thank you, Cougar.

54:43.543 --> 54:45.135
- Who's got the hard drive?
- Yeah.

54:46.713 --> 54:49.181
And uploading the algorithm.

54:51.251 --> 54:52.548
And...

54:53.453 --> 54:57.048
Holy shit. Girlfriend was right. Ha, ha, ha.

54:57.324 --> 54:59.315
- It's a courier drive.
- A what?

54:59.493 --> 55:02.394
Twenty-first-century bagman.
Russian mob banks pioneered them.

55:02.562 --> 55:04.894
- Like an electronic bearer bond.
- Okay, all right.

55:05.065 --> 55:07.659
Say that again,
but a lot slower and dumber, please.

55:08.335 --> 55:10.599
Okay. Pretend you are super evil.

55:10.771 --> 55:13.740
And you want to move
a ton of your ill-gotten blood money...

55:13.907 --> 55:17.035
...but you can't,
because it can be tracked.

55:17.244 --> 55:19.144
So you load your cash onto
this bad boy...

55:19.312 --> 55:21.906
...and you can physically move it
anywhere you wanna go.

55:22.082 --> 55:24.380
And we have Max's courier drive, right?

55:24.751 --> 55:27.584
We have Max's $400 million.

55:29.222 --> 55:31.952
All right, Clay, before you go
do something noble like smashing it...

55:32.125 --> 55:34.059
...I say we go on Amazon
and get a jet.

55:34.227 --> 55:35.524
It doesn't work that way.

55:35.696 --> 55:39.223
Unfortunately courier drives can only load
and unload on their home systems.

55:39.433 --> 55:44.097
Although if we were gonna buy stuff,
I'd say a canary-yellow stretch Hummer.

55:44.271 --> 55:46.501
No, no. We're gonna trade it back to him.

55:46.707 --> 55:48.800
He's gonna get his money
and clear our names.

55:48.975 --> 55:50.340
- No, we made a deal.
- Yes.

55:50.544 --> 55:51.772
Aisha.

55:52.979 --> 55:54.947
He's gotta kill us now. You know that.

55:56.349 --> 55:57.475
Yeah, I know that.

55:57.651 --> 56:00.620
This has a record of every IP address
it's been jacked into.

56:00.787 --> 56:03.620
And there's one address
that comes up a lot.

56:03.824 --> 56:05.883
Obviously someplace
this keeps going back to.

56:06.059 --> 56:07.117
Max's base of ops.

56:10.063 --> 56:11.928
Port of Los Angeles.

56:14.835 --> 56:17.827
Thing probably has files on
every black-book op he's ever pulled.

56:18.872 --> 56:19.930
Including Bolivia.

56:20.240 --> 56:22.435
We could hit him there,
we could clean it out...

56:22.609 --> 56:24.975
...expose the world to what he's done.

56:25.145 --> 56:26.612
Clear our names in the process.

56:27.380 --> 56:29.473
All right, it's a good plan.

56:31.118 --> 56:32.210
And we still kill him.

56:35.388 --> 56:36.446
Absolutely.

56:40.660 --> 56:44.061
We appreciate you meeting us
at a single-story facility.

56:44.231 --> 56:45.596
No problem.

56:45.766 --> 56:48.064
I view that entire incident
as your standard...

56:48.235 --> 56:50.669
..."getting to know each other"
business orientation.

56:50.837 --> 56:51.963
I agree.

56:52.139 --> 56:53.936
But now that we do know each other...

56:54.107 --> 56:58.544
...know that if you ever come near me with
that Yankee Doodle, tough-guy bullshit...

56:58.712 --> 57:01.237
...you will be fed to my dogs.

57:03.116 --> 57:05.778
As you know, we had a hiccup
on our end with the money.

57:05.952 --> 57:08.785
One billion dollars. This is the new price.

57:08.955 --> 57:10.889
- One billion?
- Cash.

57:11.057 --> 57:12.718
Cash is gonna be difficult.

57:12.893 --> 57:17.830
Difficult? Mr. Wade, life the way
you people want to live it is difficult.

57:17.998 --> 57:21.695
You want less difficult?
Move to my country. Study Hinduism.

57:21.868 --> 57:25.929
Meditate. Cultivate serenity.
Way less difficult.

57:26.106 --> 57:29.098
But you want to buy bombs.

57:30.343 --> 57:33.471
I'm afraid that's a more difficult
way of life.

57:34.481 --> 57:35.948
Mr. Wade.

58:05.912 --> 58:06.936
Hello.

58:07.848 --> 58:10.578
He wants one billion, in cash.

58:10.750 --> 58:12.183
<i>That's a lot of paper routes.</i>

58:13.453 --> 58:14.852
Stay wet.

58:15.722 --> 58:18.350
Did you get me my 18-man firing team
I asked for?

58:18.525 --> 58:20.117
<i>- Yup.
- Okay.</i>

58:20.560 --> 58:23.154
Change of plans. Kill them.

58:23.363 --> 58:24.853
Kill my 18 guys?

58:25.031 --> 58:27.431
Or fire them. Whichever is easiest.

58:27.601 --> 58:29.762
Honestly, firing them.

58:29.936 --> 58:32.905
Okay. Did you give them intel
on Clay's people?

58:33.273 --> 58:36.174
- Well, yeah.
- And we're back to killing them.

58:37.310 --> 58:40.802
Fine, I'll kill them.
What are we doing instead?

58:40.981 --> 58:43.176
What's the matter? You related to them?

58:43.383 --> 58:44.816
Actually one of them, yeah.

58:45.285 --> 58:46.946
Really? By blood?

58:47.153 --> 58:50.554
A brother-in-law. I said I'd kill him.
What are we doing?

58:51.057 --> 58:55.357
It's not what we're gonna do.
It's what Clay's gonna do for us.

58:55.562 --> 58:59.328
- And that is?
- Get us our billion, baby.

59:10.844 --> 59:12.072
What are we up against?

59:17.984 --> 59:19.008
Chryon.

59:19.185 --> 59:20.743
Oh, shit.

59:21.187 --> 59:22.449
Who's Chryon?

59:22.622 --> 59:25.489
Chryon Security Solutions.
Ex-Special Forces.

59:25.659 --> 59:29.026
Basically a bunch of guys like Cougar
without the warm and cuddly side.

59:31.631 --> 59:34.293
We start recon at 0600.

59:34.634 --> 59:37.000
Anyone not here for it...

59:37.904 --> 59:39.235
...I'll understand.

59:58.224 --> 1:00:00.522
I was just going over the plan.

1:00:01.494 --> 1:00:03.519
You wanna go over the plan?

1:00:04.331 --> 1:00:06.390
Let's go over the plan.

1:00:14.774 --> 1:00:16.605
Ah, shit.

1:00:16.776 --> 1:00:18.107
You okay?

1:00:18.812 --> 1:00:21.042
Petunias are playing the Marigolds
on Sunday.

1:00:21.915 --> 1:00:23.473
So?

1:00:23.984 --> 1:00:25.975
These are the Marigolds.

1:00:26.152 --> 1:00:27.676
Whoa.

1:00:27.921 --> 1:00:30.185
- Those are some hard-looking 8-year-olds.
- I know.

1:00:30.357 --> 1:00:32.723
Look at these inmates. Heh, heh.

1:00:33.393 --> 1:00:34.621
What are you doing?

1:00:36.629 --> 1:00:41.396
I was just trying to connect
Fadhil's drug operation with Max's cash.

1:00:41.568 --> 1:00:44.401
There's about 4 million missing.
I'm trying to track it down.

1:00:45.605 --> 1:00:49.302
- What are you doing, Pooch?
- Jensen hacked a satellite for me earlier.

1:00:49.476 --> 1:00:51.103
What you need a satellite for?

1:00:55.715 --> 1:00:57.046
Wait a second, is that today?

1:00:57.617 --> 1:00:59.585
Yeah.

1:00:59.786 --> 1:01:01.777
Probably knows
if it's a boy or a girl now.

1:01:01.955 --> 1:01:04.116
- Congratulations, man.
- Congratulations.

1:01:04.290 --> 1:01:05.416
Thank you, man.

1:01:05.592 --> 1:01:07.958
Say that now, but you know Jolene.

1:01:08.128 --> 1:01:10.323
She finds out I'm alive,
she's gonna kill me.

1:01:14.901 --> 1:01:17.233
I can't let her have that baby
without me.

1:01:21.541 --> 1:01:23.099
What? What?

1:01:23.710 --> 1:01:25.940
Pooch, we all know
we're gonna die in there.

1:01:29.049 --> 1:01:30.914
And we can do that without you.

1:01:31.584 --> 1:01:32.846
No, you can't.

1:01:33.286 --> 1:01:34.685
Go home.

1:01:37.257 --> 1:01:38.519
Got it.

1:01:38.858 --> 1:01:42.225
Fadhil's 4 million didn't disappear.
It just went into a private account.

1:01:42.395 --> 1:01:43.726
Whose account?

1:01:43.897 --> 1:01:45.296
It's a family trust.

1:01:45.632 --> 1:01:48.863
Says that in the event of his death,
goes to his kid.

1:01:49.069 --> 1:01:50.661
Name of...

1:01:51.037 --> 1:01:53.597
- Shit.
- Wow.

1:01:55.175 --> 1:01:56.699
Tell me what happened in Bolivia.

1:02:01.981 --> 1:02:04.142
We thought we were on a legitimate op.

1:02:04.684 --> 1:02:07.118
Paint a terrorist camp
so we could bomb it.

1:02:08.521 --> 1:02:12.252
Turns out we were just executing
some Max vendetta.

1:02:12.759 --> 1:02:14.784
So you knew nothing about Fadhil?

1:02:14.961 --> 1:02:16.588
A target's a target.

1:02:18.198 --> 1:02:21.895
Never would have known the difference
if we hadn't seen those kids and gone in.

1:02:24.137 --> 1:02:25.968
You went in?

1:02:26.539 --> 1:02:28.268
Well, yeah. We had to.

1:02:29.943 --> 1:02:32.241
It was 25 innocent kids in there, Aisha.

1:02:33.947 --> 1:02:34.971
Did you see him?

1:02:36.015 --> 1:02:37.744
Yeah.

1:02:38.818 --> 1:02:40.615
Why do you wanna know all this?

1:02:40.920 --> 1:02:44.447
Did you kill Fadhil, Clay?

1:02:45.792 --> 1:02:47.487
Who are you?

1:02:50.163 --> 1:02:51.892
She's Fadhil's daughter, Clay!

1:02:52.065 --> 1:02:54.033
She's Fadhil's daughter!
Fadhil's daughter.

1:02:54.200 --> 1:02:55.758
Oh, shit.

1:02:58.171 --> 1:03:01.629
She's got a gun and it's pointed at my dick.
Clay, it's pointed at my dick.

1:03:02.041 --> 1:03:03.668
Rather it was pointed at your face?

1:03:03.843 --> 1:03:05.640
I know it makes no sense, but yes.

1:03:07.814 --> 1:03:08.974
Better?

1:03:09.149 --> 1:03:10.173
Not really.

1:03:10.350 --> 1:03:12.477
- Where's your gun, Jensen?
- In the van.

1:03:12.652 --> 1:03:14.643
- What's it doing there?
- Not much.

1:03:14.821 --> 1:03:17.449
- Would you shut up?
- What if it was pointed at your dick?

1:03:53.092 --> 1:03:55.026
- Aah!
- J, where you hit?

1:03:55.195 --> 1:03:56.992
She shot me in my arm!

1:03:57.197 --> 1:03:59.131
You're gonna live. You're gonna live.

1:04:01.067 --> 1:04:02.591
Cougar, be gentle!

1:04:07.540 --> 1:04:09.303
Clay.

1:04:09.842 --> 1:04:12.072
We gotta go, now.

1:04:14.280 --> 1:04:15.747
Come on.

1:04:22.021 --> 1:04:25.252
Home again, home again, jiggety-jig.

1:04:33.299 --> 1:04:35.631
- Do you have the money?
- Jesus.

1:04:35.802 --> 1:04:37.770
Always with the money.

1:04:38.438 --> 1:04:43.273
Hi, how are you?
How've you been? Namaste?

1:04:43.476 --> 1:04:47.810
I recently attended the funeral of my
best friend who you had thrown off a roof.

1:04:47.981 --> 1:04:49.471
How have you been?

1:04:50.283 --> 1:04:51.910
I can't complain.

1:04:52.085 --> 1:04:55.953
Actually I'm thinking about getting
a satellite radio for my car.

1:04:57.824 --> 1:04:59.314
God, you are short.

1:04:59.826 --> 1:05:01.555
Seriously, how much do you weigh?

1:05:01.761 --> 1:05:03.786
Are you standing in a hole? What...?

1:05:04.631 --> 1:05:06.155
We have your ordnances.

1:05:07.500 --> 1:05:11.561
Alrighty. Let's make a cash withdrawal.

1:05:12.105 --> 1:05:16.474
And who want to be a billionaire?

1:05:40.199 --> 1:05:41.723
She burned us.

1:05:44.704 --> 1:05:45.966
The whole op's blown.

1:05:48.341 --> 1:05:50.366
She knows our names, faces.

1:05:52.245 --> 1:05:53.940
Does she know about our families?

1:05:55.114 --> 1:05:57.082
Damn it, Clay, look at me.

1:06:00.420 --> 1:06:02.650
Does she know about our families?

1:06:06.926 --> 1:06:07.984
Yes.

1:06:12.732 --> 1:06:14.597
I gotta go home, to Springfield.

1:06:16.035 --> 1:06:19.129
Jensen can come with me.
His niece is in New Hampshire.

1:06:20.340 --> 1:06:21.864
I'm done.

1:06:27.213 --> 1:06:30.808
Well, I'm going to the port, okay?

1:06:36.255 --> 1:06:38.587
You get back to your families.

1:06:39.826 --> 1:06:41.157
We'll get Max.

1:06:41.794 --> 1:06:46.026
I did this. I made the call in Bolivia.
I put your families in danger.

1:06:46.232 --> 1:06:47.756
Just let me and Clay finish this.

1:06:47.934 --> 1:06:50.027
So you two idiots are gonna
go in there blind?

1:06:55.475 --> 1:06:57.033
Three.

1:06:58.344 --> 1:07:01.541
Hey, getting shot's great.
I'm up for doing it again.

1:07:02.515 --> 1:07:03.777
Four idiots.

1:07:10.556 --> 1:07:11.614
You sons of bitches.

1:07:17.830 --> 1:07:18.956
I'll drive.

1:07:19.132 --> 1:07:20.531
Five.

1:07:54.333 --> 1:07:55.630
We're in. Status?

1:07:56.135 --> 1:07:58.103
The Pooch is good.

1:07:59.439 --> 1:08:01.600
All right, Mojito.
It's just me and you, Papi.

1:08:02.742 --> 1:08:04.209
And this hot-ass van.

1:08:36.309 --> 1:08:37.833
Hey, you!

1:08:54.060 --> 1:08:55.925
And disco.

1:08:58.865 --> 1:09:01.197
- What's the password?
- Let us in or I'll kill you.

1:09:01.734 --> 1:09:03.258
Correct.

1:09:03.736 --> 1:09:06.637
Main server is two skylights over.
I'm coming out of that door.

1:09:06.806 --> 1:09:10.674
Be ready to move as soon as Cougar
hits the fire alarm. Get gone.

1:09:26.993 --> 1:09:30.588
I'm above the computer room.
Maybe 30 seconds out.

1:09:31.063 --> 1:09:32.428
Shit.

1:09:33.165 --> 1:09:34.189
Wade's here.

1:09:35.535 --> 1:09:37.867
<i>Last chance to get the hell out of Dodge.</i>

1:09:38.104 --> 1:09:39.128
Roger that.

1:09:42.975 --> 1:09:44.840
- Hey, Clay.
- Yeah?

1:09:45.044 --> 1:09:46.102
Check this out.

1:09:49.849 --> 1:09:51.544
Go, Petunias.

1:09:55.588 --> 1:09:57.988
And the crowd goes wild.

1:09:58.457 --> 1:10:00.220
Where do you think you're going?

1:10:00.526 --> 1:10:01.618
How you guys doing?

1:10:01.794 --> 1:10:03.489
<i>Cougar, squelch when you're in position.</i>

1:10:03.663 --> 1:10:04.755
Squelch.

1:10:12.905 --> 1:10:14.497
Cougs? Cougs?

1:10:14.674 --> 1:10:16.539
Well, what do we have here?

1:10:17.577 --> 1:10:18.635
What's up, fellas?

1:10:21.547 --> 1:10:23.674
I think someone's trying to set us up.

1:10:25.785 --> 1:10:26.979
Jesus.

1:10:28.821 --> 1:10:30.186
Something's not right.

1:10:32.725 --> 1:10:34.352
Oh, yeah?

1:10:49.241 --> 1:10:51.038
Hello, Clay.

1:10:54.480 --> 1:10:55.742
Roque.

1:10:56.716 --> 1:10:58.377
Wade.

1:10:59.986 --> 1:11:01.453
Yeah.

1:11:02.655 --> 1:11:06.887
After the Miami fiasco, I cut a deal, Clay.

1:11:11.063 --> 1:11:12.223
You're a goddamn traitor.

1:11:12.398 --> 1:11:14.161
No, you betrayed us!

1:11:15.034 --> 1:11:18.970
You were gonna keep planning missions, ways
to find Max, until you got us all killed.

1:11:19.138 --> 1:11:21.971
- No.
- Yes! I tried to tell you. You wouldn't listen.

1:11:22.141 --> 1:11:26.202
No, you wanted your revenge.
The face-to-face with the big bad wolf.

1:11:26.379 --> 1:11:29.041
The voice on the radio. All that bullshit.

1:11:29.382 --> 1:11:30.781
Now I get to walk away.

1:11:30.983 --> 1:11:32.416
We all would've walked, Roque.

1:11:35.054 --> 1:11:36.351
Don't you get it yet?

1:11:37.690 --> 1:11:39.453
There's no server.

1:11:41.827 --> 1:11:43.488
Max lured you here.

1:11:44.163 --> 1:11:46.791
This is a CIA cash stash.

1:11:47.633 --> 1:11:52.730
Kill me now
and maybe you walk away from this.

1:11:53.072 --> 1:11:54.562
No, you die later.

1:11:54.740 --> 1:11:57.208
You're about to steal a billion dollars
from the CIA.

1:12:00.312 --> 1:12:02.007
Congratulations, Roque.

1:12:03.149 --> 1:12:06.414
You just helped these assholes
get everything they need to start a war.

1:12:09.588 --> 1:12:10.987
We cool?

1:12:15.928 --> 1:12:17.896
He's not my problem.

1:12:19.432 --> 1:12:20.797
Take him away.

1:12:22.168 --> 1:12:24.102
Let's get back to the boat.

1:12:25.004 --> 1:12:27.837
Hold on. Hold on.

1:12:30.476 --> 1:12:33.912
I followed you everywhere, man.
Everywhere.

1:12:34.980 --> 1:12:37.540
Just couldn't do that shit no more.

1:12:38.851 --> 1:12:40.648
You're gonna die very badly.

1:12:43.622 --> 1:12:45.021
No.

1:12:54.033 --> 1:12:55.193
Come on, let's go.

1:13:01.774 --> 1:13:05.733
Do you have any fours?

1:13:07.646 --> 1:13:08.670
Go fish?

1:13:11.584 --> 1:13:14.781
You actually have two fours. Two.

1:13:14.987 --> 1:13:17.148
You don't understand this game, do you?

1:13:24.296 --> 1:13:26.924
Looks like somebody's money's here.

1:13:28.868 --> 1:13:30.301
By the way...

1:13:30.503 --> 1:13:32.437
...your ordnances are right here.

1:13:32.605 --> 1:13:33.765
Tricky Vikki.

1:13:37.543 --> 1:13:39.067
Four snukes and a Ducati.

1:13:40.379 --> 1:13:41.744
As requested.

1:13:49.121 --> 1:13:50.145
So you're Max?

1:13:52.191 --> 1:13:53.624
Welcome to the team.

1:13:58.931 --> 1:14:01.764
Supervise the loading of the money
onto our plane.

1:14:02.201 --> 1:14:03.259
What do you mean?

1:14:06.405 --> 1:14:07.463
What do you mean?!

1:14:08.707 --> 1:14:10.698
New change of plan.

1:14:29.495 --> 1:14:30.792
Roque.

1:14:32.264 --> 1:14:33.288
Move.

1:14:34.533 --> 1:14:36.160
Move it. Let's go.

1:14:42.174 --> 1:14:44.836
- Get down on your knees.
- You heard him.

1:14:53.986 --> 1:14:55.010
No?

1:15:01.093 --> 1:15:02.583
Pooch!

1:15:03.796 --> 1:15:06.731
- Son of a bitch!
- You know, I like that hat.

1:15:06.932 --> 1:15:08.559
That's a great hat.

1:15:09.735 --> 1:15:11.430
Hey.

1:15:13.072 --> 1:15:15.302
I really don't care if there's a hole in it.

1:15:20.913 --> 1:15:22.642
What are you smiling at?

1:15:27.987 --> 1:15:29.352
Now that's a bad-ass chick.

1:15:57.449 --> 1:15:58.643
Payback's a bitch.

1:16:03.923 --> 1:16:06.619
Never touch the hat. Hm?

1:16:19.705 --> 1:16:21.332
Can you stand?

1:16:21.507 --> 1:16:23.771
I've been shot in both of my legs.

1:16:23.943 --> 1:16:26.411
What kind of dumbass question
is that? Really?

1:16:26.578 --> 1:16:28.205
So now we're Mr. Grumpy Pants.

1:16:28.380 --> 1:16:30.678
You're not the only one
who's been shot today.

1:16:31.650 --> 1:16:33.709
Dude, you're standing.

1:16:35.020 --> 1:16:36.317
Back it up.

1:16:40.492 --> 1:16:44.121
I'm gonna need you
to arm this device right now.

1:16:44.630 --> 1:16:47.861
Extremists are about to be framed for
cratering the great Port of L.A.

1:16:48.033 --> 1:16:51.298
- You are insane.
- I am engineering a global terrorist conflict...

1:16:51.503 --> 1:16:55.530
...that's finally gonna restore some order
to this big blue marble.

1:16:56.976 --> 1:16:59.968
Now light the firecracker.

1:17:13.025 --> 1:17:14.390
Cougs.

1:17:16.495 --> 1:17:17.519
Clay!

1:17:18.497 --> 1:17:19.896
Did you kill him?

1:17:22.968 --> 1:17:25.698
My father found out about
Max's real plans.

1:17:25.871 --> 1:17:28.101
He was gonna stop him.

1:17:28.907 --> 1:17:31.467
Did you kill him?

1:17:34.546 --> 1:17:35.979
Yes.

1:17:38.450 --> 1:17:42.045
- Aisha, he was a bad man.
- It doesn't matter!

1:17:42.721 --> 1:17:44.313
I know.

1:17:45.958 --> 1:17:48.290
You can kill me right now.

1:17:48.460 --> 1:17:51.224
Or you can let me help you do
what you need to do.

1:17:52.364 --> 1:17:55.561
Either way, I get it.

1:18:07.980 --> 1:18:09.538
Let's go get Max.

1:18:13.018 --> 1:18:15.111
Wade said boat.
That means we're at the docks.

1:18:15.287 --> 1:18:16.549
Pooch, can you stand?

1:18:18.190 --> 1:18:20.021
Oh. Oh, this is stupid question day.

1:18:20.192 --> 1:18:22.717
This is stupid question day.
Nobody decided to tell me.

1:18:22.895 --> 1:18:26.422
- No, that's cool. That's awesome.
- Come on, Legless Pooch. I got you.

1:18:27.366 --> 1:18:29.459
- Here we go.
- All right, let's move.

1:18:30.169 --> 1:18:32.194
This isn't over yet.

1:18:57.596 --> 1:19:01.930
Come on, fellas. I hate to rush you,
but I got a plane to catch.

1:19:06.004 --> 1:19:07.062
Come on!

1:19:26.825 --> 1:19:29.487
There you go, there you go!
Get it in there, let's go!

1:19:31.663 --> 1:19:34.393
I got Roque. Rest of you get Wade.
Cougar, run point cover.

1:19:34.566 --> 1:19:36.727
Legless Pooch and I are on it.
Come on, buddy.

1:19:40.973 --> 1:19:44.272
Call me Legless Pooch again,
you're gonna be Headless Jensen.

1:19:45.210 --> 1:19:48.304
I think it's a cool name.
Makes you sound like a pirate.

1:19:48.480 --> 1:19:49.538
Your mama's a pirate.

1:19:58.190 --> 1:19:59.623
Go!

1:20:02.060 --> 1:20:03.425
Cover me!

1:20:17.009 --> 1:20:19.273
- Get us in the air.
- We don't have room for lift.

1:20:19.444 --> 1:20:22.174
Hey, do as you're told!
Go down there and turn around!

1:20:27.653 --> 1:20:29.177
- Shit!
- Damn it.

1:20:42.100 --> 1:20:45.228
You know, I always wondered
how this was gonna play out, Clay.

1:20:45.404 --> 1:20:47.872
I told you already. You die very badly.

1:20:48.974 --> 1:20:50.168
Oh, yeah?

1:20:50.909 --> 1:20:51.933
All right.

1:21:07.926 --> 1:21:09.791
Oh, my God.

1:21:13.599 --> 1:21:15.590
Jensen, run! Run!

1:21:28.580 --> 1:21:31.310
- Now I'm definitely gonna cut your head off.
- Go for it.

1:21:36.989 --> 1:21:39.423
Son of a bitch!

1:21:54.473 --> 1:21:55.599
You lose!

1:22:10.622 --> 1:22:12.783
We're clear to take off.
Get us out of here.

1:22:12.958 --> 1:22:13.982
Okay, all right.

1:22:14.159 --> 1:22:15.524
- Get us out of here.
- Okay!

1:22:16.528 --> 1:22:18.996
The ordnance is live.

1:22:19.598 --> 1:22:21.691
And this is the remote trigger.

1:22:23.835 --> 1:22:26.668
<i>Detonation in ten, nine...</i>

1:22:33.245 --> 1:22:35.304
That son of a bitch is stealing our cash!

1:23:01.973 --> 1:23:04.635
<i>Clay, Wade's on the move.</i>

1:23:05.010 --> 1:23:06.272
<i>Clay!</i>

1:23:06.678 --> 1:23:09.010
<i>You got Wade coming at you!</i>

1:23:21.760 --> 1:23:23.022
- Run him over.
- What?

1:23:23.195 --> 1:23:24.219
Run him over!

1:23:43.615 --> 1:23:44.946
Take him.

1:24:16.314 --> 1:24:17.941
Outstanding.

1:24:27.626 --> 1:24:29.025
<i>Clay, we got a situation here.</i>

1:24:29.194 --> 1:24:32.891
<i>I'm looking at a giant, vibrating
Easter egg from hell and no Max.</i>

1:24:33.064 --> 1:24:34.156
I think I see him.

1:24:34.332 --> 1:24:37.460
Initiate backup plan C.

1:24:39.371 --> 1:24:41.168
The one where you rescue me.

1:24:53.151 --> 1:24:54.448
Shit.

1:25:01.326 --> 1:25:03.226
ETA? I'm at rendezvous.

1:25:06.698 --> 1:25:07.722
Hello?

1:25:08.633 --> 1:25:09.725
Hello?

1:25:10.969 --> 1:25:14.166
What's the matter? Crappy reception?

1:25:24.583 --> 1:25:26.847
- That was my ride.
- Bummer.

1:25:27.619 --> 1:25:29.519
- Clay, is it?
- Colonel.

1:25:29.688 --> 1:25:31.315
So you know what this is, then?

1:25:31.523 --> 1:25:33.821
- Remote pressure trigger.
- Very good.

1:25:34.259 --> 1:25:37.558
I release the button for ten seconds
and everything goes boom.

1:25:39.331 --> 1:25:41.663
So since you can't shoot me...

1:25:44.135 --> 1:25:45.568
Goddamn it!

1:25:45.737 --> 1:25:47.204
You wanna try that again?

1:25:48.907 --> 1:25:50.306
That hurt.

1:25:52.978 --> 1:25:55.037
Having fun? Enjoying yourself?

1:25:55.213 --> 1:25:56.942
Give me the trigger, I let you live.

1:25:57.115 --> 1:25:59.481
You know the worst thing about
being the good guy?

1:25:59.684 --> 1:26:00.708
What's that?

1:26:03.154 --> 1:26:04.781
Having to make decisions like this.

1:26:39.124 --> 1:26:42.582
Hey! Ha, ha, ha. Look what Pooch found!

1:26:42.794 --> 1:26:44.125
Look what I found.

1:26:44.896 --> 1:26:46.420
This should do it.

1:26:52.103 --> 1:26:53.127
Disarmed.

1:26:55.941 --> 1:26:57.169
Hello?

1:27:01.346 --> 1:27:02.779
It's Max.

1:27:08.253 --> 1:27:09.379
Hi, Max.

1:27:09.554 --> 1:27:11.920
<i>Colonel. Nice catch.</i>

1:27:12.090 --> 1:27:16.117
<i>We could've shared the dream together.
Now you're back to where you started.</i>

1:27:16.294 --> 1:27:18.524
Yeah, well, I wouldn't go that far.

1:27:18.697 --> 1:27:19.959
<i>Why's that?</i>

1:27:20.131 --> 1:27:22.622
Well, now I know what you look like.

1:27:23.001 --> 1:27:25.435
Be seeing you soon, Max.

1:27:36.615 --> 1:27:38.640
It's a nice watch, homes.

1:27:47.092 --> 1:27:48.616
Come with us.

1:27:50.629 --> 1:27:54.429
When this is over and he's dead...

1:27:55.700 --> 1:27:57.600
...you and I are gonna finish that dance.

1:27:59.070 --> 1:28:00.970
Fair enough.

1:28:03.775 --> 1:28:06.335
Yo, let's go home.

1:28:07.412 --> 1:28:08.709
She is volatile.

1:28:18.957 --> 1:28:20.652
Poppa, Poppa, we are clear.

1:28:21.459 --> 1:28:23.086
Setting perimeter.

1:28:24.029 --> 1:28:25.496
You're five by.

1:28:28.800 --> 1:28:31.166
I'm a little nervous
about this one, colonel.

1:28:33.038 --> 1:28:35.973
Whatever happens, you get to that package.

1:28:43.481 --> 1:28:45.972
- Mission is live.
- Acknowledged.

1:28:48.553 --> 1:28:50.020
I'm in.

1:29:00.699 --> 1:29:04.601
Okay. The Pooch can do this.

1:29:07.372 --> 1:29:09.897
The Pooch can do this.

1:29:17.582 --> 1:29:18.947
Hey.

1:29:19.117 --> 1:29:20.607
Sir, you can't come in here.

1:29:20.785 --> 1:29:22.082
It's okay.

1:29:24.089 --> 1:29:25.249
I'm the father.

1:29:25.757 --> 1:29:27.247
Where the hell have you been?

1:29:28.927 --> 1:29:30.292
Traffic.

1:29:32.797 --> 1:29:33.957
Traffic?

1:29:42.440 --> 1:29:46.206
<i>It's a boy. It's a boy, Clay.</i>

1:29:46.377 --> 1:29:48.845
<i>- And he looks just like me.
- Congrats.</i>

1:29:51.750 --> 1:29:53.115
Cheers.

1:30:18.576 --> 1:30:21.443
<i>- We're taking a big chance here.
- They're getting slaughtered.</i>

1:30:29.854 --> 1:30:33.346
Come on, ref! Watch number nine!
She's throwing elbows!

1:30:33.558 --> 1:30:34.855
- Shh.
- Shh.

1:30:36.294 --> 1:30:38.023
Sorry. I'm sorry.

1:30:39.898 --> 1:30:42.264
Hi. My niece, number 21.

1:30:42.901 --> 1:30:44.163
She's the star of the team.

1:30:46.905 --> 1:30:48.304
- Diaper change.
- What?

1:30:50.575 --> 1:30:53.976
- Colonel, you wanna jump on this for me?
- I'd rather jump on a live grenade.

1:30:54.179 --> 1:30:56.545
I'm invested.
I have 100 dollars on this game.

1:30:56.748 --> 1:30:59.182
Who'd you find to bet
on a girls' soccer game with?

1:30:59.350 --> 1:31:01.079
Yeah.

1:31:01.252 --> 1:31:02.583
You bet against the Petunias?

1:31:02.754 --> 1:31:04.153
Well, he gave me points.

1:31:04.355 --> 1:31:05.913
Big mistake.

1:31:06.324 --> 1:31:07.985
Let's go, girls. Let's go, girls!

1:31:11.396 --> 1:31:12.727
Oh, no.

1:31:16.401 --> 1:31:18.801
Hey, hey, hey! You okay?
Are you all right?

1:31:19.003 --> 1:31:23.463
- What is that? That is a foul! Are you blind?
- Get off the field, sir! Are you blind?

1:31:23.675 --> 1:31:25.336
Hey, boss, boss.

1:31:25.977 --> 1:31:28.912
- Get off the field!
- You're not gonna blow your whistle?

1:31:29.080 --> 1:31:30.240
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1:31:30.882 --> 1:31:32.281
- Better...
- Yeah, we should.

1:31:32.450 --> 1:31:34.782
- A girl kicked to the ground is not a foul?
- Get off!

1:31:34.953 --> 1:31:38.218
I wanna know who you work for!
How high up does this go?

1:31:38.423 --> 1:31:39.583
Get off the field!

1:31:39.757 --> 1:31:41.918
This is worse than the NBA!

1:31:42.126 --> 1:31:43.218
Okay, come on.

1:31:43.695 --> 1:31:45.424
Come on. Loser!

1:31:45.597 --> 1:31:47.462
You don't deserve to wear those stripes!
