47:45.563 --> 47:46.929
- Tell me about your childhood.

47:49.000 --> 47:51.601
She says you dream about
killing your brother,

47:51.603 --> 47:54.570
yet you never had a
brother, is that right?

47:56.674 --> 47:57.907
Strange thing.

47:59.344 --> 48:02.278
The mind is complex,
as you know,

48:02.280 --> 48:04.947
memory being one of its more
unpredictable functions.

48:04.949 --> 48:06.716
According to the most
current research,

48:06.718 --> 48:07.984
when the mind
remembers an event,

48:07.986 --> 48:09.518
it's not the actual
event that is recalled

48:09.520 --> 48:11.787
but merely the memory of the
last time you remembered it.

48:11.789 --> 48:14.757
Eventually, we add elements,
change the order of things.

48:14.759 --> 48:16.192
Sometimes we manage
to conjure up

48:16.194 --> 48:19.262
characters who
never even existed.

48:19.264 --> 48:21.831
- And what does that make you?

48:24.369 --> 48:27.203
- So you wanna
get smart with me?

48:28.339 --> 48:29.772
What is it, Tommy?

48:30.975 --> 48:34.343
What grim tale are
you so afraid to tell?

48:39.117 --> 48:40.182
Excuse me.

48:40.184 --> 48:42.485
I seem to have lost myself.

48:45.556 --> 48:46.789
Air's a bit stale in here.

48:46.791 --> 48:49.692
Would you mind
opening the window?

49:11.816 --> 49:14.050
Tell me about your mother.

49:16.621 --> 49:19.021
- I don't have a mother.

49:19.023 --> 49:22.591
- You
don't have a mother.

49:22.593 --> 49:24.060
Incredible, that
must be a first.

49:24.062 --> 49:27.964
Tell me, how can one be
born without a mother?

49:29.634 --> 49:31.600
- I killed her.

49:33.404 --> 49:37.139
You can kill your mother
just by being born.

49:38.343 --> 49:41.377
- So, the
rumors are true.

49:41.379 --> 49:44.080
What about the brother?

49:44.082 --> 49:45.648
- My twin?

49:46.784 --> 49:48.351
He was never born.

49:49.620 --> 49:51.354
He died in the womb.

49:52.490 --> 49:54.657
They had to cut her
open to take me out,

49:54.659 --> 49:56.425
and she had a stroke.

49:57.895 --> 50:01.797
They say her heart stopped
the moment I came out.

50:01.799 --> 50:05.601
- My god, that explains
a lot, now doesn't it?

50:07.538 --> 50:11.440
Twins, one dies, one lives,
and a maternal death,

50:11.442 --> 50:14.443
what a way to begin,
what a weight.

50:15.413 --> 50:16.612
How can one live up to that?

50:16.614 --> 50:19.281
Two lives for the price of one?

50:23.121 --> 50:24.320
Tell me about your relationship.

50:28.459 --> 50:31.727
- Well, what's to tell?

50:31.729 --> 50:33.496
- Are you happy?

50:33.498 --> 50:34.497
- At times.

50:38.403 --> 50:40.369
She complains.

50:40.371 --> 50:41.337
- About what?

50:41.339 --> 50:42.505
- About me.

50:43.441 --> 50:44.673
My work.

50:44.675 --> 50:46.175
- What type
of work do you do?

50:46.177 --> 50:48.944
- Social work,
domestic violence.

50:48.946 --> 50:50.279
- That's a noble cause.

50:50.281 --> 50:51.480
- I think so.

50:51.482 --> 50:52.715
- So
what's the problem.

50:52.717 --> 50:56.419
- Well, she
questions my intentions.

50:57.555 --> 51:00.022
- Well, what
are your intentions?

51:00.024 --> 51:01.457
- I don't know.

51:01.459 --> 51:03.626
I thought it was interesting.

51:03.628 --> 51:06.395
I mean, it's a
noble cause, right?

53:26.571 --> 53:29.071
I'm trying to study,
if you didn't notice.

53:29.073 --> 53:31.907
- Whaddya readin' anyway?

53:31.909 --> 53:36.378
- Just now I was getting
into this book here.

53:36.380 --> 53:40.349
It's for a class on
gender and sexuality.

53:40.351 --> 53:41.817
- It's in French.

53:42.920 --> 53:46.422
- Yeah, I thought I
could learn French

53:46.424 --> 53:48.190
while studying for the class.

53:48.192 --> 53:50.092
- Oh, yeah, good idea.

53:51.229 --> 53:54.196
- Right, well, this
one is amazing.

53:56.968 --> 53:59.201
I mean, it's actually
devastating to read.

53:59.203 --> 54:02.171
It's kind of a memoir
of the author's

54:02.173 --> 54:04.807
history of sexual abuse by men.

54:07.011 --> 54:08.944
- I know what it
means to be a woman.

54:08.946 --> 54:11.347
I don't need books to tell me.

54:11.349 --> 54:13.949
There's more than
one kind of violence.

54:13.951 --> 54:16.685
I've been around enough to know.

54:17.855 --> 54:20.356
I mean, what's the plan, man?

54:22.326 --> 54:25.227
Will you save women
once and for all

54:25.229 --> 54:28.530
with the ink of
your pen?

54:28.532 --> 54:30.766
What do you know about it?

54:35.539 --> 54:37.506
There's no textbook, you know?

54:37.508 --> 54:42.077
You can't read about that
and expect to understand it.

54:47.318 --> 54:48.884
- Hey, I love you.

54:52.156 --> 54:53.922
- Then love me.

54:53.924 --> 54:55.958
Quit loving your books.

55:02.600 --> 55:05.367
It doesn't make it more true
if you repeat it in French.

55:13.544 --> 55:16.412
Does not sound pretty,
whatever you said.

55:16.414 --> 55:19.548
- I said, "Tell me
you love me, too."

55:20.418 --> 55:21.583
Or don't you?

55:23.821 --> 55:26.755
- There aren't words
for everything.

55:33.197 --> 55:35.364
Tommy, be gentle with me.

55:36.567 --> 55:40.703
I promise to be nice.

55:40.705 --> 55:43.138
- No promises, be gentle.

55:43.140 --> 55:44.340
You can.

56:11.635 --> 56:13.869
And it's always like that.

56:16.006 --> 56:17.740
We kiss, kiss, kiss.

56:20.444 --> 56:24.380
Then he disappears,
goes down to whisper

56:24.382 --> 56:26.715
secrets in between my legs.

56:28.719 --> 56:32.020
But I wonder sometimes
if it's not more

56:33.758 --> 56:35.991
for him than it is for me,

56:38.028 --> 56:40.529
as if he whispers to himself.

56:42.666 --> 56:47.736
And the sound of my pleasure
returns his gift, like an echo,

56:50.174 --> 56:52.474
as if I'm just an echo box.

56:57.214 --> 57:01.383
Well, you have to be empty
to be a good echo box.

57:06.023 --> 57:09.658
In the end, it's hard to
understand how to receive

57:09.660 --> 57:13.495
a gift that was taken
from you to begin with.

57:18.469 --> 57:21.437
And I'll tell you another thing.

57:21.439 --> 57:24.606
To understand Tommy,
you have to know

57:24.608 --> 57:29.211
that the softest skin on
his whole body is here,

57:29.213 --> 57:33.549
the skin on the bottom side
of this thing when it's hard.

57:33.551 --> 57:36.118
And that's the secret.

57:36.120 --> 57:38.654
If you understand that, you can

57:38.656 --> 57:41.123
understand how to love a man.

57:44.795 --> 57:45.694
- Hey.

57:48.065 --> 57:50.566
No, I wanna be inside of you.

57:59.977 --> 58:02.411
- Typically, he refuses.

58:02.413 --> 58:07.483
In fact, Tommy's
favorite word is no.

58:10.387 --> 58:13.789
Loving is easy.

58:15.025 --> 58:19.862
To be loved, that
takes courage.

59:03.841 --> 59:04.740
- Oh shit.

59:07.044 --> 59:08.343
- What's the rush?

59:08.345 --> 59:10.612
- I forgot I have a class today.

59:10.614 --> 59:12.214
I'm late.

59:12.216 --> 59:16.351
- Why do you always rush
to rinse off so quickly?

59:17.454 --> 59:19.521
- Well, 'cause I'm late.

59:20.457 --> 59:21.957
Gotta go.

59:21.959 --> 59:23.258
- Dinner?

59:23.260 --> 59:25.327
- Uh, I'll be home late.

never actually married,

that you proposed to
her with a Ring Pop.

01:11:21.978 --> 01:11:24.345
Why are you so scared
of being alone?

01:11:24.347 --> 01:11:25.513
- Well, I--

01:11:25.515 --> 01:11:28.816
- Do you ever wonder
if by refusing

01:11:28.818 --> 01:11:31.019
to let your love
take its own shape,

01:11:31.021 --> 01:11:33.488
by struggling to
maintain control

01:11:33.490 --> 01:11:35.890
over something as
fluid as affection,

01:11:35.892 --> 01:11:39.060
that you don't damage
it all the more?

01:11:39.062 --> 01:11:42.997

suffocate both yourself

01:11:42.999 --> 01:11:45.633

01:11:45.635 --> 01:11:46.567

01:11:46.569 --> 01:11:49.304
- I suppose you believe yourself

01:11:50.774 --> 01:11:53.541
to be the true
guardian of your love?

01:11:53.543 --> 01:11:55.843
Can't you see you've
come to resent her,

01:11:55.845 --> 01:11:59.113
like a child resents a mother
whose warmth he yet craves?

01:11:59.115 --> 01:12:00.648
- I--

01:12:00.650 --> 01:12:04.218
- Must love and freedom be
so relentlessly opposed?

01:12:07.424 --> 01:12:09.891
You grasp after her like water

01:12:12.228 --> 01:12:15.530

is to say, in vain.

no matter how I try,

01:29:43.479 --> 01:29:46.446
I can't even seem to
bring myself to cry.

01:29:46.448 --> 01:29:49.116
I'm an empty shell for
you, oh Risen Lord.

01:29:49.118 --> 01:29:50.317
I am your empty tomb.

01:29:50.319 --> 01:29:52.753
Good earth, good
womb, good wife too.

01:29:52.755 --> 01:29:55.155
What am I but a
dwelling place for you?

01:29:55.157 --> 01:29:56.590
How you drew me in.

01:29:56.592 --> 01:29:59.526
I fell for Tommy the dreamer,
bright eyes, twin stars,

01:29:59.528 --> 01:30:01.828
so full of charm,
so sweet and warm.

01:30:01.830 --> 01:30:03.964
You held me fast
between your rigid arms.

01:30:03.966 --> 01:30:05.465
And I should've seen it comin',

01:30:05.467 --> 01:30:07.901
the push and pull that
kept me on my toes.

01:30:07.903 --> 01:30:09.536
But I've danced
around your fears

01:30:09.538 --> 01:30:11.638
for one too many
unbecoming years.

01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:12.839
What harm lies here?

01:30:12.841 --> 01:30:14.341
What sorry past--

01:30:14.343 --> 01:30:16.643
Poor kid, who told you that
love and freedom were opposed?

01:30:16.645 --> 01:30:18.145
They're one and the same.

01:30:18.147 --> 01:30:20.981
But even so, you come and
go, and I, the solid ground,

01:30:20.983 --> 01:30:24.317
the tether pole your orbit
turns around, well, I remain.

01:30:24.319 --> 01:30:25.919
Didn't I keep watch for you?

01:30:25.921 --> 01:30:27.821
Hold fast the thread
attached to you?

01:30:27.823 --> 01:30:29.289
To watch as it unwound?

01:30:29.291 --> 01:30:32.159
To count your steps and remind
you of the way back home?

01:30:32.161 --> 01:30:34.561
Good earth, good
womb, good wife too.

01:30:34.563 --> 01:30:36.830
What was I but a
ball of clay for you?

01:30:36.832 --> 01:30:38.799
Your secret fears
like fingers crept

01:30:38.801 --> 01:30:40.801
behind my eyes and
made them shine.

01:30:40.803 --> 01:30:43.336
You carved a mouth tuned
to the tenor of your name.

01:30:43.338 --> 01:30:45.872
My hair grew long,
became a nest for you,

01:30:45.874 --> 01:30:48.542
and I felt my brow grow
heavy with your pain.

01:30:48.544 --> 01:30:50.744
Even now, my sadness bores you.

01:30:50.746 --> 01:30:53.480
You no longer want me,
but you cannot let me go.

01:30:53.482 --> 01:30:55.949
Well, here is your
longed-for freedom.

01:30:55.951 --> 01:31:00.153
I was only in your way, but now
it's my time for me to flee,

01:31:00.155 --> 01:31:02.422
to rediscover my
own right of way.

01:31:02.424 --> 01:31:05.392
I go tonight out from
these walls built by fear.

01:31:05.394 --> 01:31:06.893
You wear me out.

01:31:06.895 --> 01:31:09.763
Let me go to the place where
I have not yet arrived.

01:31:09.765 --> 01:31:12.432
Goodbye my love,
my breath, my life.

01:31:12.434 --> 01:31:15.936
I'm going to where I

- Tommy, we know
you're in there.

01:34:14.216 --> 01:34:16.282
- We're bringing him in.

01:34:40.709 --> 01:34:43.276
- Over here, Tommy!

01:35:08.770 --> 01:35:10.070
- Tommy?

01:35:32.828 --> 01:35:35.328
- Now where were we?

01:35:35.330 --> 01:35:36.529
Hm.

01:35:36.531 --> 01:35:39.966
Oh, right, come here,
you little vermin.

01:35:39.968 --> 01:35:45.038

You can point your

any way you want, but
I'm not the only one!

01:37:02.984 --> 01:37:04.818
So who'll throw the first stone?

01:37:06.021 --> 01:37:07.253
What's the matter?

01:37:07.255 --> 01:37:09.189
I thought I was
the one you chose

01:37:09.191 --> 01:37:11.191

01:37:11.193 --> 01:37:14.160
full of men too
scared to be alone!

01:37:15.497 --> 01:37:18.264
- If only it were so simple.

01:37:18.266 --> 01:37:21.267
But you can't pass
guilt around that way.

01:37:21.269 --> 01:37:23.002
It's much too sticky, you see.

01:37:23.004 --> 01:37:24.637

There's still one more

Let's hear what the
Defense has to say.

01:37:36.117 --> 01:37:41.020
He's been oh so quiet since
the scales have tipped my way!

01:37:42.057 --> 01:37:45.425
- Does the Defense
wish to call a witness?

01:37:47.562 --> 01:37:50.964
Does the Defense have
a final statement?

01:37:56.371 --> 01:37:59.439
- There goes your
last chance, boy!

01:37:59.441 --> 01:38:01.407
I guess it's up to you.

01:38:02.510 --> 01:38:05.678

01:39:22.791 --> 01:39:23.690
- Order!

01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:28.628
The Prosecution may
make a final statement.

01:39:32.867 --> 01:39:35.301
- There is nothing so arbitrary

01:39:35.303 --> 01:39:38.604
as a fence around a plot of land

01:39:38.606 --> 01:39:41.341
or a body with a line around it.

01:39:43.111 --> 01:39:45.845
And what have we here
but an empty frame!

01:39:45.847 --> 01:39:49.115
A rusted, barbed-wire fence,
there's nothing there,

01:39:49.117 --> 01:39:52.418
no property, no ground on
which to build a foundation,

01:39:52.420 --> 01:39:56.856
the basic building blocks of
what we commonly call love.

01:39:56.858 --> 01:39:59.092
The story begins with
two nascent twins,

01:39:59.094 --> 01:40:00.994
bound together in
the mother's warmth.

01:40:00.996 --> 01:40:02.929
But what was for
one a nurturing womb

01:40:02.931 --> 01:40:06.299
would become for the other
a dark and deathly tomb.

01:40:06.301 --> 01:40:08.267
They did everything they could
to save the second child,

01:40:08.269 --> 01:40:10.103
and their efforts
weren't in vain.

01:40:10.105 --> 01:40:13.606
But with her hand held
fast by her desperate love,

01:40:13.608 --> 01:40:17.076
the mother died from
the physical strain.

01:40:17.078 --> 01:40:19.979
And there he was,
our unlucky boy,

01:40:19.981 --> 01:40:22.749
a life wrought in
exchange for two.

01:40:22.751 --> 01:40:24.250
And as the father refused
to hold him close,

01:40:24.252 --> 01:40:26.285
he learnt from day one
the debt that was due,

01:40:26.287 --> 01:40:29.222
so he searched for a way
to earn his very life!

01:40:29.224 --> 01:40:31.624
He found a thousand different
ways to tell the story

01:40:31.626 --> 01:40:35.695
of his loss and a means to
exonerate, but in every corner,

01:40:35.697 --> 01:40:38.831
a finger pointed, a
swelling sea of shame.

01:40:38.833 --> 01:40:43.736
Buried in books, he found his
mother on every single page.

01:40:44.806 --> 01:40:48.241
Along comes Carolyn, poor girl.

01:40:48.243 --> 01:40:49.776
What need I say?

01:40:49.778 --> 01:40:52.145
We've all witnessed her tale,
just one of the more tragic

01:40:52.147 --> 01:40:54.714
of his attempts
to find his place.

01:40:54.716 --> 01:40:57.850
Oh, the irony of a
man who champions

01:40:57.852 --> 01:41:01.054
the safety and care of
women but cannot love

01:41:01.056 --> 01:41:03.656
the one who waits with
open arms beside him.

01:41:03.658 --> 01:41:07.560
A true dialogue of compassion
between flesh and blood

01:41:07.562 --> 01:41:11.531
is replaced by the idea,
the mere image of love.

01:41:13.868 --> 01:41:15.468
And so poor Carolyn
was sacrificed

01:41:15.470 --> 01:41:18.304
to his self-serving
crusade, a sad little man

01:41:18.306 --> 01:41:21.407
with a sorry tale and
a whole wide world

01:41:21.409 --> 01:41:24.644
to save, which
brings us here today.

01:41:24.646 --> 01:41:27.880
And what do we make
of this lady, Yes,

01:41:28.783 --> 01:41:30.883
such a strange and unheard name.

01:41:30.885 --> 01:41:32.552
But it's all too clear
if the jury knows

01:41:32.554 --> 01:41:35.688
that his favorite
word was always no.

01:41:35.690 --> 01:41:37.323
And what is it that he refuses?

01:41:37.325 --> 01:41:39.525
What are these secret
fears of yours?

01:41:39.527 --> 01:41:42.328
Why do you tremble at the
thought of losing your grip?

01:41:42.330 --> 01:41:45.631
What is this property that you
clench with white knuckles?

01:41:45.633 --> 01:41:47.834
Are not your hands wrapped
around her very throat?

01:41:47.836 --> 01:41:49.769
Is it not her skin that
you wear like a wreath

01:41:49.771 --> 01:41:52.438
around your neck, or
a crown of thorns?

01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:54.440
Are not her bones the very frame

01:41:54.442 --> 01:41:56.642
that kept you sane and composed?

01:41:56.644 --> 01:41:59.479
And without this frame, he
would scatter like dust!

01:41:59.481 --> 01:42:02.949
The infinite uncertainty of Yes,

01:42:02.951 --> 01:42:07.186
yes to the mystery of suffering
that cannot be explained,

01:42:07.188 --> 01:42:08.788
yes to the life
you've been given

01:42:08.790 --> 01:42:11.724
despite or because of
its inaugural pain.

01:42:11.726 --> 01:42:14.327
yes to the one who would love
you in spite of yourself,

01:42:14.329 --> 01:42:16.395
to the love she gave,
not meant to be earned,

01:42:16.397 --> 01:42:18.965
nothing to pay back,
no price in return,

01:42:18.967 --> 01:42:22.068
for love is not much
like a bartered exchange,

01:42:22.070 --> 01:42:26.639
and yes to the past, for
the joy and the pain.

01:42:26.641 --> 01:42:31.711
But no was your preferred
response, a disposition of denial.

01:42:33.081 --> 01:42:36.182
But a pain repressed will
be otherwise expressed,

01:42:36.184 --> 01:42:38.718
and hence our gathering today.

01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:42.088
And so it is, the final
charge against you,

01:42:42.090 --> 01:42:45.091
that you have slain
the lady, Yes,

01:42:45.093 --> 01:42:46.893
woman who wades
through a sea of names

01:42:46.895 --> 01:42:48.394
but who cannot be
allowed to speak,

01:42:48.396 --> 01:42:51.531
who sings instead, whose
voice quivers softly,

01:42:51.533 --> 01:42:53.799
high above your little
fortress of fear.

01:42:53.801 --> 01:42:58.104
She is the tremor of silence,
the whisper of possibility,

01:42:58.106 --> 01:43:01.340
the fluidity within your
very own soul that you have

01:43:01.342 --> 01:43:06.179
made rigid, petrified to supply
the lie to your feeble mind

01:43:06.181 --> 01:43:09.982
that behind your name,
something real resides.

01:43:12.453 --> 01:43:15.021
To tell the truth, I pity you,

01:43:16.858 --> 01:43:21.694
for who knew that a true
dialogue was one without speech?

01:43:24.098 --> 01:43:29.168
Two pairs of unblinking eyes,
an exchange of beating hearts.

01:43:31.506 --> 01:43:33.839
Two lips poised, half open,

01:43:36.811 --> 01:43:39.946
ready to speak,
but never speaking

01:43:39.948 --> 01:43:43.015

the punishment is to be you.

01:46:24.178 --> 01:46:27.646
You have eliminated
your will to deny.

01:46:27.648 --> 01:46:30.483
Now at last,
together, we silence

01:46:31.686 --> 01:46:34.153
the drone of your guilty cry.
