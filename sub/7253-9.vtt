BUT THAT'S

06:13.790 --> 06:15.125
ALL I COULD COME UP WITH.

06:15.167 --> 06:16.710
AND THE ONLY REASON

06:15.167 --> 06:16.710
I THOUGHT OF THAT

06:16.751 --> 06:18.962
WAS BECAUSE DAVEY JUST LEARNED

06:16.751 --> 06:18.962
"DUCK DUCK GOOSE,"

06:19.004 --> 06:21.298
AND THE DUCKS LOOKED

THIS IS SO EXCITING!

06:40.192 --> 06:42.443
HOW DOES IT LOOK?

06:46.156 --> 06:48.825
I DON'T HATE IT.

06:46.156 --> 06:48.825
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

06:48.867 --> 06:51.494
IT'S JUST -- OKAY.

06:48.867 --> 06:51.494
WHAT IF JACKSON BROUGHT HOME

06:51.536 --> 06:53.997
A SET OF HIS GRANDMOTHER'S

06:51.536 --> 06:53.997
POTS AND PANS?

06:54.039 --> 06:55.832
NOW, OBVIOUSLY,

06:54.039 --> 06:55.832
YOU NEED SOME POTS AND PANS,

06:55.874 --> 06:58.293
AND THESE ARE FREE AND ALL,

06:55.874 --> 06:58.293
BUT THEY'RE REALLY OLD.

06:58.335 --> 07:00.003
YOU DON'T WANT TO HURT

06:58.335 --> 07:00.003
JACKSON'S FEELINGS

07:00.045 --> 07:02.005
'CAUSE HE FEELS VERY

07:00.045 --> 07:02.005
SENTIMENTAL ABOUT THE PANS,

07:02.047 --> 07:03.965
BUT THEY'VE GOT FAT CHERUBS

07:02.047 --> 07:03.965
CARVED ALL OVER THEM,

07:04.007 --> 07:05.592
AND YOU JUST

07:04.007 --> 07:05.592
DON'T WANT THEM.

07:05.633 --> 07:07.344
DO THE CHERUBS INTERFERE WITH

07:05.633 --> 07:07.344
THE ACTUAL COOKING FUNCTION,

07:07.386 --> 07:08.845
OR ARE THEY JUST

07:07.386 --> 07:08.845
DECORATIVE?

07:08.887 --> 07:10.722
DECORATIVE IS A WILDLY

07:08.887 --> 07:10.722
GENEROUS DESCRIPTION,

07:10.764 --> 07:12.099
BUT FUNCTION'S FINE.

07:12.140 --> 07:13.600
WHAT HAPPENED

07:12.140 --> 07:13.600
TO MY OLD POTS AND PANS?

07:13.641 --> 07:15.810
GONE. THROWN OUT.

07:13.641 --> 07:15.810
CAN I GET THEM BACK?

07:15.852 --> 07:18.521
BABETTE'S NEPHEW, GARY,

07:15.852 --> 07:18.521
IS SLEEPING ON THEM.

07:15.852 --> 07:18.521
SLEEPING ON THEM?

07:18.563 --> 07:20.065
I'M NOT REALLY TALKING

07:18.563 --> 07:20.065
ABOUT PANS, SOOKIE.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.816
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

07:20.107 --> 07:21.816
I AM TALKING ABOUT

07:21.858 --> 07:23.651
LUKE'S GRANDMOTHER'S

07:21.858 --> 07:23.651
BEDROOM FURNITURE

07:23.693 --> 07:25.237
THAT HE SET UP

07:23.693 --> 07:25.237
IN MY BRAND-NEW BEDROOM.

07:25.279 --> 07:27.530
OH.

07:25.279 --> 07:27.530
AND HE LOVES THIS FURNITURE.

07:27.572 --> 07:30.075
AND YOU DON'T?

07:27.572 --> 07:30.075
NO, I DON'T, BUT

07:27.572 --> 07:30.075
IT SHOULDN'T MATTER, RIGHT?

07:30.117 --> 07:32.327
WHY NOT?

07:30.117 --> 07:32.327
LOOK AT EVERYTHING

07:30.117 --> 07:32.327
LUKE HAS DONE FOR ME.

07:32.369 --> 07:34.037
HE BOUGHT THE TWICKHAM HOUSE,

07:32.369 --> 07:34.037
AND THEN HE UN-BOUGHT

07:32.369 --> 07:34.037
THE TWICKHAM HOUSE,

07:34.079 --> 07:36.206
AND THEN HE ALMOST BOUGHT IT

07:34.079 --> 07:36.206
AGAIN, AND THEN HE DECIDED

07:36.248 --> 07:38.417
TO LIVE AT MY HOUSE BECAUSE

07:36.248 --> 07:38.417
I WANTED TO LIVE AT MY HOUSE.

07:38.458 --> 07:41.962
YEAH, HE DID.

07:38.458 --> 07:41.962
HE HAS TURNED HIS WHOLE LIFE

07:38.458 --> 07:41.962
UPSIDE DOWN FOR ME.

07:42.003 --> 07:44.089
HE DOES EVERYTHING

07:42.003 --> 07:44.089
IN HIS POWER TO MAKE ME HAPPY

07:44.131 --> 07:46.216
AND GIVE ME WHAT I WANT,

07:44.131 --> 07:46.216
SO CAN'T I JUST GIVE HIM

07:46.258 --> 07:48.302
THIS ONE LITTLE THING?

07:46.258 --> 07:48.302
YES, YOU CAN.

07:48.343 --> 07:49.552
NO, I CAN'T.

07:49.594 --> 07:51.430
THE BED IS SMALL

07:49.594 --> 07:51.430
AND REALLY LOW --

07:51.471 --> 07:53.014
JUST PERFECT FOR TINY,

07:51.471 --> 07:53.014
SHRUNKEN LIMBS

07:53.056 --> 07:54.808
THAT CAN'T BE TOO FAR

07:53.056 --> 07:54.808
OFF THE GROUND.

07:54.849 --> 07:56.226
AND THEN HE HAS

07:54.849 --> 07:56.226
THIS ANCIENT DRESSER

07:56.268 --> 07:57.936
WITH THE ORIGINAL

07:56.268 --> 07:57.936
FUN-HOUSE MIRROR IN IT

07:57.978 --> 07:59.604
SO THAT WHEN I WAKE UP

07:57.978 --> 07:59.604
EVERY MORNING --

07:59.646 --> 08:01.481
AND I AM AT MY MOST

07:59.646 --> 08:01.481
VISUALLY VULNERABLE --

08:01.522 --> 08:04.109
I'LL LOOK IN THERE AND THINK

08:01.522 --> 08:04.109
I'M THAT KID FROM "MASK."

08:04.151 --> 08:06.278
YOU CAN REPLACE THE MIRROR.

08:04.151 --> 08:06.278
OH, NO.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.613
HE LOVES THE MIRROR

08:06.320 --> 08:08.613
AND THE BED AND THE DRESSER --

08:06.320 --> 08:08.613
OH, AND THE PAINTINGS.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.531
DID I TELL YOU

08:08.655 --> 08:10.531
ABOUT THE PAINTINGS?

08:08.655 --> 08:10.531
NO. OF SAILBOATS?

08:10.573 --> 08:12.284
OHH.

08:10.573 --> 08:12.284
THERE'S SIX OF THEM.

08:12.326 --> 08:16.079
SIX SAILBOATS WAITING TO SAIL ME

08:12.326 --> 08:16.079
AWAY TO AN OLD-FOLKS HOME,

08:16.121 --> 08:18.915
THEN, WHEN THE WIND'S RIGHT,

08:16.121 --> 08:18.915
DROP ME OFF AT THE PEARLY GATES.

08:18.957 --> 08:21.209
I'M HATEFUL AND SELFISH.

08:18.957 --> 08:21.209
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

08:21.251 --> 08:23.003
I JUST WANT MY NEW HOUSE

08:21.251 --> 08:23.003
TO BE PERFECT.

08:23.044 --> 08:25.046
HALF THAT CRAP IN THERE WAS

08:23.044 --> 08:25.046
HAND-ME-DOWNS TO BEGIN WITH.

08:25.088 --> 08:26.631
I HAD THAT OLD BED

08:25.088 --> 08:26.631
THAT MIA LET ME SNAG

08:26.673 --> 08:28.258
FROM THE INDEPENDENCE INN.

08:28.300 --> 08:30.344
I JUST WANTED SOMETHING NEW.

08:28.300 --> 08:30.344
YOU HAVE TO TELL HIM.

08:30.385 --> 08:32.137
I CAN'T TELL HIM.

08:30.385 --> 08:32.137
MAYBE IT'S NOT SO BAD.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.555
WELL, YOU'LL SEE FOR YOURSELF

08:32.179 --> 08:34.555
ON SATURDAY NIGHT. 7:30?

08:34.597 --> 08:36.141
AYE, AYE, CAPTAIN.

08:39.102 --> 08:42.230
EMILY,

08:39.102 --> 08:42.230
SORRY TO BE SO LATE.

08:42.272 --> 08:45.233
JENSON WOULDN'T STOP TALKING.

08:45.275 --> 08:46.651
THE CAR WILL BE HERE

08:45.275 --> 08:46.651

08:46.693 --> 08:49.070

08:49.112 --> 08:51.281
REMEMBER, I'M NOT GOING

08:49.112 --> 08:51.281
TO BE BACK UNTIL TUESDAY,

08:51.323 --> 08:55.327
SO YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE

TO DEAL WITH ALEJANDRO YOURSELF.

08:55.369 --> 08:57.162
I WILL LEAVE YOU THE CHECK.

08:57.204 --> 08:58.621
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO

08:57.204 --> 08:58.621
IS HAND IT TO HIM

08:58.663 --> 09:01.541
AND TELL HIM

08:58.663 --> 09:01.541
THAT IF THERE ARE ANY PROBLEMS

09:01.582 --> 09:05.379
I WILL BE BACK

09:05.420 --> 09:07.297
I HOPE YOU TOLD THE MAID

09:05.420 --> 09:07.297

09:07.339 --> 09:10.425
FORECASTS ARE PREDICTING

09:07.339 --> 09:10.425
ARMAGEDDON, APPARENTLY.

09:10.467 --> 09:13.178
NOW, I HAVE A STOPOVER

09:10.467 --> 09:13.178

09:13.220 --> 09:16.431

09:16.473 --> 09:18.599
YOUR SAFE RETURN, DARLING,

09:16.473 --> 09:18.599

09:18.641 --> 09:20.394
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

09:20.435 --> 09:23.146

09:27.984 --> 09:30.529
PUT THAT BOX DOWN.

09:27.984 --> 09:30.529
BOTH OF YOU, EXPLAIN YOURSELVES.

09:30.570 --> 09:31.821
MR. GILMORE,

09:37.327 --> 09:38.578
DON'T KNOW, MATE.

09:37.327 --> 09:38.578
RORY LET US IN.

09:38.619 --> 09:40.038
WE CAME OVER TO HELP HER

09:38.619 --> 09:40.038
MOVE HER STUFF.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.206
MOVE HER STUFF WHERE?

09:41.248 --> 09:42.623
TO HER NEW PLACE OF RESIDENCE.

09:42.665 --> 09:44.501
WHAT DO YOU MEAN

09:42.665 --> 09:44.501
"NEW PLACE OF RESIDENCE"?

09:44.543 --> 09:46.127
RORY'S MOVING OUT?

09:44.543 --> 09:46.127
I HOPE SO.

09:46.169 --> 09:47.795
OTHERWISE, SHE'LL HAVE

09:46.169 --> 09:47.795
NOTHING TO WEAR TOMORROW.

09:47.837 --> 09:49.589
THAT'S PREPOSTEROUS!

09:47.837 --> 09:49.589
A PERSON DOESN'T JUST

09:49.630 --> 09:50.924
MOVE OUT WITHOUT A WORD.

09:50.965 --> 09:52.384
WHERE IS SHE? RORY!

10:01.059 --> 10:02.977
CLOSET SHE WAS POINTING TO.

10:03.019 --> 10:06.189
I SUPPOSE THESE HUMIDORS

ANY CHANCE

10:06.231 --> 10:07.607

10:07.648 --> 10:08.900
I PROMISE TO GIVE THEM

10:07.648 --> 10:08.900
A NICE HOME

10:08.942 --> 10:09.901
AND SHOW THEM A PICTURE OF YOU

10:09.943 --> 10:12.028
EVERY YEAR AT CHRISTMAS.

10:14.197 --> 10:15.823
VERY TALL MAN,

10:17.451 --> 10:19.578
[ BELLS JINGLE ]

10:25.292 --> 10:27.127
THEY'RE GOING TO GET COLD.

10:25.292 --> 10:27.127
ARE THEY DIFFERENT?

10:27.168 --> 10:28.711
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT?

10:27.168 --> 10:28.711
THEY SEEM DIFFERENT.

10:28.753 --> 10:30.338
THEY'RE NACHOS.

10:28.753 --> 10:30.338
NOW EAT THEM.

10:30.380 --> 10:31.965
YOU USED BAKED CHIPS.

10:32.006 --> 10:33.674
WHAT?

10:32.006 --> 10:33.674
YOU DID, DIDN'T YOU?

10:33.716 --> 10:35.760
YOU USED BAKED CHIPS

10:33.716 --> 10:35.760

10:35.802 --> 10:38.638
I DID<i> NOT</i> USE

LOW-FAT CHEESE.

10:38.679 --> 10:40.014

HOW CAN YOU TELL?

10:40.056 --> 10:41.682
HOW COULD YOU LIE?

10:40.056 --> 10:41.682
THEY TASTE THE SAME!

10:41.724 --> 10:44.311
OH, THE TRUST, LUKE.

10:41.724 --> 10:44.311

10:44.352 --> 10:45.853
TRYING TO KEEP ME HEALTHY?

10:45.895 --> 10:48.022
FINE. FORGET IT.

42:44.896 --> 42:46.189
YOU CAN THINK OF.

42:46.231 --> 42:47.899
OH -- I'M GOING

42:46.231 --> 42:47.899

42:53.530 --> 42:56.824
