00:15.348 --> 00:17.642
Coop! Coop! Hey, there you are.

00:17.726 --> 00:20.603
Hey, Katie. Just trying to find
an ending to my book.

00:20.687 --> 00:22.123
Listen. I'm not sure if you remember,

00:22.147 --> 00:24.482
but earlier this morning
we said we'd talk later.

00:24.566 --> 00:27.126
- Of course. In episode two.
- About that thing I wanna tell you.

00:27.193 --> 00:28.862
I'm dying to know
what you were gonna say.

00:28.945 --> 00:33.033
Great. So, these last ten years...

00:33.700 --> 00:37.954
Do you ever think about, you know, us?

00:38.038 --> 00:39.789
Like, what would have happened if we...

00:39.873 --> 00:42.375
Katie, are you saying
what I think you're saying?

00:42.459 --> 00:45.545
Well, if you're thinking that
what I'm saying is what I'm saying,

00:45.628 --> 00:49.090
then yes, I'm thinking that
what you're saying is what you're saying.

00:49.174 --> 00:52.260
Katie... these last ten years...

00:52.761 --> 00:55.638
Coop! Coop!

00:55.722 --> 01:01.102
Ah! Oh, my God, Ginny!

01:01.186 --> 01:03.813
- Hey, you're here! You're here!
- Yeah.

01:08.860 --> 01:14.240
Kitty, this is Ganny.
I mean, um, Gatie, this is Kitty.

01:14.324 --> 01:20.288
No, fuck! What I'm trying,
and failing, to say, is...

01:20.371 --> 01:23.750
Kathy, this is Gumpy. Ah, fuck!

01:24.334 --> 01:26.586
- You guys... What you're... Ginny!
- Ginny.

01:26.669 --> 01:28.296
- Katie. Hi.
- Hi.

01:28.379 --> 01:31.382
Ginny... Ginny, Katie, is my, um...

01:31.466 --> 01:33.510
She's my... You're my...

01:33.593 --> 01:34.803
- FiancÃ©e.
- FiancÃ©e.

01:34.886 --> 01:38.515
- Oh! Great! Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:38.598 --> 01:39.599
What are you doing here?

01:39.682 --> 01:41.851
What do you mean?
I left you a message on your machine.

01:41.935 --> 01:44.729
I was able to get off work after all.
Faison said he'd cover for me.

01:44.813 --> 01:46.272
Oh! Faison came through?

01:46.356 --> 01:48.691
Oh, yeah, Faison knew
how much I wanted to be here.

01:48.775 --> 01:51.194
Then I guess
Faison's not so bad after all.

01:51.277 --> 01:54.864
You know what? I gotta go.
I gotta go meet that guy, Peter...

01:55.615 --> 01:57.951
- Frampton.
- Oh, okay.

02:23.476 --> 02:25.687
Yeah, keep driving, asshole.

02:29.357 --> 02:31.609
Uh, what about this guy? Is he gonna stop?

02:33.069 --> 02:34.821
Here we go, finally.

02:37.991 --> 02:40.493
- Where you heading?
- I'm headed south.

02:40.577 --> 02:41.578
Hop in!

02:46.332 --> 02:47.732
Good afternoon. What can I get you?

02:47.792 --> 02:48.877
Bowl of your chili.

02:48.960 --> 02:50.295
How 'bout you, big boy?

02:50.378 --> 02:53.256
I'll have a Denver omelet
and a side of your buns.

02:54.883 --> 02:57.760
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

02:57.844 --> 03:00.722
Give me that sugar. Give me that sugar.

03:01.723 --> 03:03.563
I'm giving you the sugar!
How about some cream?

03:03.641 --> 03:05.727
No, here we go! Oh, shit!

03:05.810 --> 03:08.646
Good for you, man.
That was a hot piece of ass.

03:08.730 --> 03:12.191
That's no way to talk about a lady.
Pull the truck over.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.236
Have a nice life, my friend.

03:15.320 --> 03:16.696
Where you headin', anyway?

03:19.198 --> 03:22.201
Somewhere you can't go.

03:35.173 --> 03:37.508
Hello, old friend.

03:38.843 --> 03:42.347
Hello? Anybody home?

03:43.640 --> 03:45.099
Who is it?

03:46.893 --> 03:47.894
Mitch?

03:47.977 --> 03:49.437
Hello, Gene.

03:52.357 --> 03:56.069
So, yeah, um, then after dinner,
we walked on the Hudson.

03:56.152 --> 04:00.240
- Oh!
- And he was just funny and cute.

04:00.323 --> 04:03.117
I was like,
"I'm never letting this guy go."

04:03.201 --> 04:05.828
- I'm just a sweetie. What can I say?
- Get a room!

04:05.912 --> 04:07.914
- Oh!
- Walla-walla-hoo!

04:08.039 --> 04:10.500
Walla-walla-hey!

04:10.583 --> 04:12.418
Um... what was that about?

04:12.502 --> 04:14.921
That's the call of Camp Firewood.

04:15.004 --> 04:17.548
That's the spirit.
It's luck and serendipity.

04:17.632 --> 04:22.679
Oh, yeah. Coop told me about the spirit.
It's that totem thing, right?

04:22.762 --> 04:24.264
Uh...

04:24.347 --> 04:26.724
Yeah, well, you know,
there's more to the spirit.

04:26.808 --> 04:27.848
They'll explain it to you.

04:27.892 --> 04:29.519
That's cute.

04:29.602 --> 04:33.815
No, it's a way of life
and it's a philosophy.

04:33.898 --> 04:36.484
Yeah, Ginny, it's like when you forget
to set your alarm clock,

04:36.567 --> 04:39.445
but you wake up the next morning
at the exact right time.

04:41.072 --> 04:46.035
That's the spirit of Camp Firewood...
watching over you.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.204
It's, like, if you've ever been lost
in the dark

04:48.288 --> 04:50.790
and you're trying to find the bathroom,
and you're scared,

04:50.873 --> 04:53.751
but then you look up and you see a sign,
and the sign says "bathroom."

04:53.835 --> 04:57.046
You know, and there it is,
like, that's the spirit of Camp Firewood.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.674
Or you're worried you're late
for a meeting because of traffic,

04:59.757 --> 05:02.593
but then somehow you make it on time.

05:03.261 --> 05:06.014
- That's the spirit of Camp Firewood.
- That's right.

05:06.764 --> 05:10.226
I had a girlfriend once who thought
she was pregnant, but then she wasn't.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.353
So, that's an example of that, too.

05:13.187 --> 05:15.023
It's good luck. It's the human spirit.

05:15.106 --> 05:16.941
It's the most positive force
on the planet.

05:17.025 --> 05:19.319
Wow! That's so weird.

05:19.402 --> 05:20.653
It's not weird, it's tradition.

05:20.737 --> 05:22.071
Easy, now.

05:22.155 --> 05:25.408
Okay, I think I get it, Katie.

05:26.284 --> 05:28.286
- Do you?
- Yeah, I do.

05:28.369 --> 05:30.204
- You sure?
- I'm pretty sure.

05:30.288 --> 05:32.457
- Good.
- Yeah, it is good.

05:33.166 --> 05:36.085
The theme for tonight's dance
is an End-Summer Night's Dream,

05:36.169 --> 05:38.046
a clever play on A Midsummer Night's Dream

05:38.129 --> 05:41.090
that I came up with by myself
last night before bed.

05:41.174 --> 05:44.427
Now, you're gonna be standing by the door,
greeting people as they come in.

05:44.510 --> 05:49.432
So I really need you to embody the roles
of Theseus, Hippolyta, Puck, and Bottom.

05:49.515 --> 05:52.852
So get comfortable
in that donkey mask, Rory. I'm serious.

05:52.935 --> 05:56.814
Oh, my God. This is drama for beginners.
I used to teach this class with Ben.

05:56.898 --> 05:58.900
I'm so sorry,
this is a closed rehearsal...

05:58.983 --> 06:02.945
- Susie, oh, my God!
- Little Logan? What?

06:04.113 --> 06:06.199
- God, look at you! Oh...
- Come here.

06:08.159 --> 06:13.039
Boys and girls, you are in the presence
of a Camp Firewood living legend.

06:13.122 --> 06:15.333
This is Susie.

06:17.668 --> 06:22.381
This woman oversaw some of the greatest
theater Camp Firewood has ever seen, okay?

06:22.465 --> 06:24.926
Pippin, Chorus Line,
Fiddler, Electro-City.

06:25.009 --> 06:26.094
Not just musicals.

06:26.177 --> 06:29.222
How about Streetcar, Salesman, um...
Equus?

06:29.305 --> 06:31.766
I wanna say Godot,
but we're still waiting on that one.

06:31.849 --> 06:32.975
I'm teasing.

06:33.059 --> 06:37.146
Susie, please say something!
Teach these kids.

06:37.230 --> 06:40.483
Let them bask in the glow of your words.
Sculpt their souls.

06:40.566 --> 06:41.984
Logan, I couldn't.

06:42.068 --> 06:44.362
We won't take no for an answer.
Right, kids?

06:46.322 --> 06:48.533
Okay, okay! If you insist.

06:49.534 --> 06:51.869
So, if acting is movement,

06:51.953 --> 06:54.413
then Shakespeare is
finding the time to move

06:54.497 --> 06:56.833
and making sure
that the movement is truthful.

06:56.916 --> 06:57.917
Iambic pentameter.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.002
- Okay, everybody, stand up.
- Actually, don't.

07:00.586 --> 07:02.839
Susie, we're 40 minutes into class.
They've warmed up.

07:02.922 --> 07:04.549
- Oh, sorry, I...
- No, do your thing.

07:04.632 --> 07:07.635
Do your thing, but we can't be jerking
the kids around like this.

07:07.718 --> 07:08.886
Okay? It's a little reckless.

07:09.637 --> 07:13.808
Okay. Um, well, you're already warmed up.
Why don't we get into pairs...

07:14.809 --> 07:17.145
And then we're going
to introduce ourselves to each other.

07:17.228 --> 07:19.730
I'm sorry. This sounds like
some bastardized Meisner exercise.

07:19.814 --> 07:22.400
We've been pulling more
from Garibaldi's methods this summer.

07:23.109 --> 07:25.153
Jesus Christ, you haven't changed.

07:25.236 --> 07:27.363
Oh, no. We're just pulling from
our own experience

07:27.447 --> 07:28.799
to convey the truth of the character.

07:28.823 --> 07:31.033
- My truth for my character...
- Sure, sure.

07:31.117 --> 07:34.454
Would be that I want you
to back the flack off.

07:34.537 --> 07:37.707
Okay, wow! That just happened, didn't it?

07:37.790 --> 07:40.793
What kind of bush-league power play
are you trying to pull here?

07:40.877 --> 07:45.756
You get me up in front of these kids,
and you try to show me up in my theater?

07:45.840 --> 07:49.218
It is not your theater.
That day has passed.

07:49.302 --> 07:51.113
Everybody said
you were an ambitious little prick,

07:51.137 --> 07:53.139
and I would say, "No, not Logan."

07:53.222 --> 07:55.433
And you've always been
the most overrated director

07:55.516 --> 07:58.478
to grace these footlights, Susie!

07:58.561 --> 08:02.982
You remember the staging of
your final scene of Kiss Me, Kate in 1979?

08:03.065 --> 08:06.736
So arch, so crass, so tacky.

08:06.819 --> 08:09.697
So... What was that word
I was looking for? Regional.

08:09.780 --> 08:11.157
I gave you the lead in that play!

08:11.240 --> 08:13.260
I did the best I could
with the mess you made of it!

08:13.284 --> 08:14.494
Your performance was bloated.

08:14.577 --> 08:17.205
It was obtuse. You couldn't hold a tune.

08:17.288 --> 08:19.373
You can't sing and you can't dance.

08:19.457 --> 08:21.626
You want
a little acting wisdom, kids?

08:21.709 --> 08:25.588
Get ready for talentless gatekeepers
like this one

08:25.671 --> 08:26.547
to get in your way.

08:26.631 --> 08:29.509
He's not your teacher.
He's a cautionary tale.

08:29.592 --> 08:31.469
You guys want some other advice?

08:31.552 --> 08:36.307
This is what happens when needy girls
with daddy issues move to Hollywood.

08:36.390 --> 08:38.643
And then they come back
to their summer camp

08:38.726 --> 08:40.645
and hope that everyone remembers them,

08:40.727 --> 08:43.188
and tells them how great they were
ten years ago.

08:43.272 --> 08:47.610
Because they know they'll never be
as good as they were then.

08:53.908 --> 08:56.035
- You disgust me!
- You bore me!

09:03.084 --> 09:04.085
And scene.

09:06.170 --> 09:10.716
That was a two-person
improvisational acting exercise.

09:11.551 --> 09:12.802
And...

09:13.636 --> 09:15.012
Thank you, Logan, for...

09:16.264 --> 09:18.808
And just to piggyback off of that,
thank you, Susie.

09:19.976 --> 09:21.078
Get the fuck out of my theater.

09:21.102 --> 09:25.356
This will always be my theater, bitch.

09:26.774 --> 09:28.192
Bye, you guys.

09:32.280 --> 09:34.198
You are incredible, you know that?

09:34.282 --> 09:36.617
You had me.
I thought it was real the entire time.

09:37.660 --> 09:40.496
And it turns out she went back
to her maiden name, Murphy.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.456
Which is why the agency
had no record of her.

09:42.540 --> 09:45.084
So you see, everything's totally fine.

09:45.876 --> 09:47.962
- Why you laughing?
- Nothing.

09:48.045 --> 09:49.130
No, what?

09:49.714 --> 09:51.716
Well, of course that's what happened.

09:51.799 --> 09:53.479
Ah, forget it.
Why don't we sit over there?

09:53.551 --> 09:55.428
No, Claire, what do you mean?

09:55.511 --> 09:58.431
You know, it's just that's how
it always works in the movies.

09:59.015 --> 10:01.809
They do some investigating,
they find something suspicious.

10:01.892 --> 10:05.062
And the hot nanny has a perfectly
reasonable excuse for why it happened.

10:05.146 --> 10:07.565
- It's textbook.
- Yeah, because she has nothing to hide.

10:07.648 --> 10:08.959
She totally has something to hide.

10:08.983 --> 10:10.943
You know,
it's all part of her master plan.

10:11.027 --> 10:13.362
Gives the parents
a false sense of security,

10:13.446 --> 10:16.741
and it just gives her more time
to tear their life apart.

10:17.241 --> 10:20.911
I don't want to talk about this anymore.
This is a circular conversation.

10:22.330 --> 10:24.790
- Hey!
- Hey, what's up?

10:29.462 --> 10:32.757
Hey, guys.
Grabbed a little grub from the kitchen.

10:32.840 --> 10:34.050
Oh!

10:34.133 --> 10:37.219
Wait a minute.
Are those those Tigerclaw guys?

10:37.303 --> 10:39.972
Oh, yes.
They are buying Firewood from Beth

10:40.056 --> 10:42.683
- so our traditions will be preserved.
- Hey, guys!

10:42.767 --> 10:44.310
Hey!

10:44.393 --> 10:46.437
Oh, God, this place gives me
the heebie-jeebies.

10:46.520 --> 10:50.650
Easy, now. Remember the plan.
Play nice until we close the deal.

10:50.733 --> 10:54.737
- Ah! I just wanna crack some skulls.
- Easy. Easy, now.

10:54.820 --> 10:57.573
They have no idea how bad
we are gonna butt-fuck them

10:57.657 --> 10:59.241
when we take their camp away.

10:59.325 --> 11:02.370
We're gonna fuck their butts
from here to Timbuktu.

11:02.453 --> 11:04.038
Here, let me throw them a bone.

11:04.121 --> 11:05.247
Walla-walla-hoo!

11:05.331 --> 11:07.375
Walla-walla-hey!

11:07.458 --> 11:08.876
I love that!

11:08.959 --> 11:11.754
- Fun!
- Fuck your butthole so strong.

11:12.963 --> 11:15.549
What is this,
ground-up Chihuahua?

11:15.633 --> 11:17.259
What happened to the food in this place?

11:17.343 --> 11:19.512
Gary, you used to cook food in this place,

11:19.595 --> 11:22.848
and if memory serves,
it tasted like bunk-rot pilaf.

11:22.932 --> 11:23.932
Oh!

11:23.974 --> 11:26.185
- Burn!
- Lick my butt, Cooperberg.

11:26.268 --> 11:28.771
'Cause I've been on the line
chopping and blanching

11:28.854 --> 11:31.982
and sizzling and pickling for ten years!

11:32.066 --> 11:34.777
I can whip up a lunch with whatever
they got in that mess hall

11:34.860 --> 11:38.030
that would make all of your taste buds
do backflips.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.659
Prove it.

11:41.742 --> 11:44.537
- Yeah! Prove it.
- Yeah!

11:44.620 --> 11:47.623
Okay, I'll need a red wine
to pair with the main course,

11:47.706 --> 11:48.874
uh, a white for dessert.

11:48.958 --> 11:52.044
I'll need an egg timer,
two serving platters...

11:52.837 --> 11:55.256
Make it three.
And, um, a really nice table cloth.

11:55.339 --> 11:58.092
Um, you know what?
I can pick that stuff up.

11:58.175 --> 12:01.679
Ben is gonna put the baby down
for her nap, and we're low on diapers.

12:01.762 --> 12:03.180
Kill two birds with one stone.

12:03.264 --> 12:06.767
Wait, you know what? I just realized
I want to tag along, also.

12:06.851 --> 12:10.896
I need some stuff from the store, too.
You know, jelly remover for photo albums.

12:10.980 --> 12:13.357
Oh, well, I could pick up
whatever you need, McKinley.

12:13.441 --> 12:14.733
What's the big deal, Renata?

12:14.817 --> 12:17.361
Why are you so dead set
on me not coming with you?

12:17.445 --> 12:18.946
What are you trying to hide?

12:19.530 --> 12:22.010
I'm not trying to hide anything.
I'm just trying to be helpful.

12:22.074 --> 12:25.786
Oh. Then I guess we're both
hamburger helpers this afternoon.

12:31.459 --> 12:33.627
Oh, wait. No, she was pregnant.

12:35.254 --> 12:36.547
Oh, shit!

12:37.798 --> 12:41.010
Thank you so much for letting me
interview you, Mr. MacArthur.

12:41.093 --> 12:44.555
General questions are fine, but we're not
gonna discuss any upcoming projects,

12:44.638 --> 12:45.764
on or off the record.

12:45.848 --> 12:48.517
Okay. So, Garth MacArthur,

12:48.601 --> 12:52.521
if your life were a movie,
what would the title be?

12:53.355 --> 12:55.441
If my life were a movie,
what would the title be?

12:55.524 --> 12:56.609
Um...

12:58.277 --> 12:59.820
That is such a good question.

13:01.155 --> 13:07.828
If my life were a movie, it would
be called Sitting Right in Front of You.

13:09.914 --> 13:14.877
If you could give your younger self
one piece of advice, what would it be?

13:14.960 --> 13:16.420
Trust your gut.

13:17.296 --> 13:19.131
If it's right,
you'll feel it in your soul.

13:20.257 --> 13:21.717
The heart knows.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.385
Garth...

13:25.012 --> 13:25.930
Ga...

13:26.013 --> 13:28.516
What would you say
to the woman of your dreams?

13:29.099 --> 13:31.560
- Can you give us a minute?
- "Can you give us a minute"?

13:32.561 --> 13:36.106
Sorry, I'm saying
can you give us a minute?

13:37.816 --> 13:40.444
Oh! Yeah, sorry.

13:46.992 --> 13:49.620
Don't you see, Susie?
I can't play it cool any longer.

13:49.954 --> 13:52.715
I can't get through a bloody interview
without melting into your eyes.

13:59.505 --> 14:00.589
Say you'll be mine.

14:00.673 --> 14:03.342
But we always promised
that we wouldn't let our relationship

14:03.425 --> 14:04.593
get in the way of our work.

14:04.677 --> 14:08.764
I wanna work on a project
with you... called forever.

14:08.847 --> 14:12.935
Don't you ask me to jump
if you're not gonna be there to catch me.

14:13.811 --> 14:16.021
Oh, I'll catch you
and cradle you in my arms.

14:16.855 --> 14:21.819
Make me the happiest man ever to walk
this crazy planet some call Earth.

14:21.902 --> 14:22.903
Be my girl.

14:24.029 --> 14:25.823
- I'll be your girl.
- Oh!

14:27.366 --> 14:30.244
I can't believe it. I love you, Susie.

14:31.787 --> 14:33.831
I love you.

14:35.291 --> 14:38.419
I do. I love you! I love you! I love you!

14:38.502 --> 14:42.590
I love you, I love you, I love you.
I love you, I love you, I love you. Ah!

14:43.716 --> 14:47.344
I wanna shout it from the mountaintops!
I wanna sing it far and wide!

14:49.930 --> 14:53.601
Garth MacArthur loves Susie!

14:55.352 --> 14:58.105
- What are we doing?
- I don't know.

15:09.700 --> 15:11.410
Can I come back in?

15:24.798 --> 15:26.634
- Hey, Vic.
- Hey.

15:26.717 --> 15:28.594
I didn't know you played the mouth organ.

15:28.677 --> 15:32.348
- Oh, yeah, my uncle was in jail, so...
- Oh, gotcha.

15:32.431 --> 15:34.767
So I just pull this out
whenever I need to think.

15:34.850 --> 15:36.894
Hmm. You got something on your mind?

15:36.977 --> 15:39.188
As a matter of fact, I do. Uh...

15:40.564 --> 15:44.777
A person who is attending this reunion,
who shall remain nameless,

15:44.860 --> 15:46.654
wants me to pork his wife, Donna.

15:46.737 --> 15:51.116
So, yeah, I guess you could say
I got a bit on my mind.

15:51.241 --> 15:52.660
Whoa!

15:52.743 --> 15:55.120
- That is crazy.
- Yeah.

15:55.204 --> 15:57.122
- Is it because you're a virgin?
- What?

15:57.206 --> 15:58.886
No, I mean,
is that part of the attraction?

15:58.916 --> 16:00.584
- No!
- What?

16:02.461 --> 16:03.796
I'm sorry. I just...

16:03.879 --> 16:09.051
Are you kidding me? That's...
I took care of that when I was 14.

16:10.386 --> 16:11.929
- Let me see it.
- What?

16:13.389 --> 16:14.389
Okay.

16:19.103 --> 16:21.772
- Okay.
- Oh! Hands are cold.

16:23.774 --> 16:27.319
Vic, come on. Look at this thing.

16:27.403 --> 16:29.113
It's pristine!

16:29.196 --> 16:32.616
It's pink and soft and fluffy.
It's like an angel food cake.

16:32.700 --> 16:36.328
No, no, no. It has to have miles on it,
you know? There's no wear and tear.

16:36.412 --> 16:38.747
It's got no crow's feet or anything.

16:38.831 --> 16:41.875
I mean, it should look like
Edward James Olmos, but it doesn't.

16:41.959 --> 16:44.712
It looks like a newborn baby bird
that's in my hand.

16:44.795 --> 16:46.255
You know that just by looking at it?

16:46.338 --> 16:50.009
Oh... oh, yeah. And, you know,
when Donna looks at this,

16:50.092 --> 16:52.362
- she's gonna know you're a virgin.
- She's gonna look at it?

16:52.386 --> 16:54.626
I mean, at 26, it should look like
an old catcher's mitt.

16:55.305 --> 16:56.515
Anyway...

16:57.850 --> 16:58.851
Good luck to you.

17:01.937 --> 17:04.022
- An old catcher's mitt?
- Mm-hmm.

17:04.106 --> 17:06.191
- Thanks, Abby.
- I'll see you soon.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.318
An old catcher's mitt.

17:23.375 --> 17:27.046
Hey, think I'm gonna go check out
the magazines.

17:48.650 --> 17:49.651
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:49.735 --> 17:50.778
You okay, McKinley?

17:50.861 --> 17:52.181
Oh, yeah.

17:52.237 --> 17:53.989
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah. No, they just...

17:54.073 --> 17:55.949
Yeah. Yeah. The... So...

17:56.033 --> 17:57.910
- Let's get out of here.
- Mm-hmm.

17:57.993 --> 18:00.120
I call shotgun.

18:00.204 --> 18:02.206
Ah!

18:28.774 --> 18:32.861
All right. Uh, we are calling
this culinary adventure...

18:33.695 --> 18:34.988
"An Afternoon at Camp."

18:36.365 --> 18:39.576
I'm gonna start you off with
a macaroni and cheese cooked two ways.

18:39.660 --> 18:42.287
The first is a play
on the classic American mac and cheese.

18:42.371 --> 18:45.874
Then, over here, I have
a deconstructed mac and cheese.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.918
This is house-made macaroni.

18:48.001 --> 18:50.671
Uh, four varietals of artisanal cheeses,

18:50.754 --> 18:53.841
a Humboldt Fog, a Roquefort, a Taleggio,

18:53.924 --> 18:56.802
and, for a bit of heat,
a Spanish Manchego.

18:56.885 --> 18:58.011
Ooh!

18:58.095 --> 19:01.140
Wow! Gary, I gotta say,
this looks incredible.

19:01.223 --> 19:05.060
Well, I really enjoyed preparing
these bright, bold flavors for you today.

19:05.144 --> 19:08.689
And, you know, my food is my heart,
my heart is my food.

19:08.772 --> 19:13.986
So, dig in. Or, as they say
in some parts of France, bon appÃ©tit.

19:16.572 --> 19:19.116
That's French. I knew.

19:19.199 --> 19:22.035
Hey, um, how come
you never mentioned Katie

19:22.119 --> 19:24.705
all those times you've told me
about camp friends?

19:25.581 --> 19:28.500
I didn't? I'm sure I did.

19:28.584 --> 19:33.255
Mm... no. You've mentioned Susie, Ben,
McKinley, Victor,

19:33.338 --> 19:35.632
Neil, Abby, Gary, Andy, J.J.,

19:35.716 --> 19:40.637
Claire, Mark, Gene, Steve, Gail, Jeff,
Claude, Rhonda, Yaron, Donna, Henry,

19:40.721 --> 19:44.808
and Blake, but never Katie.

19:45.684 --> 19:48.395
Well, honestly,
we didn't know each other that well.

19:48.478 --> 19:52.107
Really? It looked like
you guys were pretty friendly.

19:52.191 --> 19:55.277
We're just close talkers.
I mean, is that illegal now?

19:55.360 --> 19:58.780
She's just some random girl that I went
to summer camp with a long time ago.

19:58.864 --> 20:01.325
We barely know each other.

20:01.408 --> 20:03.452
What are you talking about?

20:03.535 --> 20:06.622
Coop and Katie were, like,
the hot couple last day of '81.

20:06.705 --> 20:08.349
But you knew that.
You must have known that.

20:08.373 --> 20:11.543
- What?
- Wait. Are you kidding?

20:11.627 --> 20:17.132
No. Being obsessed with Katie
was Coop's defining character trait.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.152
But it was a long time ago.
I wouldn't worry about it.

20:19.176 --> 20:20.776
They kissed twice before she dumped him.

20:22.930 --> 20:24.348
Excuse me.

20:25.641 --> 20:27.601
Smooth move, Ex-Lax.

20:30.020 --> 20:32.105
Smooth move, Ex-Lax.

20:32.189 --> 20:35.901
Are you sure you're okay with us
telling everybody about us?

20:35.984 --> 20:41.365
Yes! Yes, tell the world, darling.
Send a, you know, what's the...

20:42.658 --> 20:44.493
- A telegram?
- A telegram.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.579
Is there anything you can't do?

20:49.164 --> 20:50.832
It's gonna be one hell of a wedding.

20:50.916 --> 20:52.960
Garth, you have a phone call
in the infirmary.

20:53.043 --> 20:54.503
- For me?
- Yeah.

20:54.586 --> 20:57.506
Here in the States, "You have a call"
means the call is for you.

20:57.589 --> 21:00.592
- Yeah.
- Oh, stay here, darling. All right?

21:00.676 --> 21:02.678
Don't move... Literally.

21:03.595 --> 21:05.315
- I don't want you to move a muscle.
- Okay.

21:05.347 --> 21:07.474
- Very still. Motionless.
- All right.

21:07.557 --> 21:09.142
Be right back.

21:12.729 --> 21:14.731
- Claire, I really need to talk to you.
- What?

21:14.815 --> 21:17.651
You were right about everything.
Renata's a total psycho.

21:17.734 --> 21:19.987
- I never said that.
- Claire, look at me!

21:20.070 --> 21:23.031
It's just like you warned.
She bought a knife. She's dangerous.

21:23.115 --> 21:25.355
- We have to figure out what she's up to.
- Are you sure?

21:25.409 --> 21:28.453
I'm 100% sure.
I've never been more sure of anything.

21:28.537 --> 21:30.622
I need your help.
We're in this together now.

21:30.706 --> 21:33.208
We are? What do you mean? In what?

21:33.292 --> 21:37.004
No matter how weird or awful things get,
it's you and me, fifty-fifty.

21:37.087 --> 21:38.588
Oh, I don't agree to that.

21:38.672 --> 21:39.715
- Fifty-fifty.
- No.

21:39.798 --> 21:41.842
- Claire, fifty-fifty.
- Absolutely not.

21:41.925 --> 21:43.302
- Fifty-fifty!
- Stop saying it.

21:43.385 --> 21:44.886
- Claire.
- I will not agree.

21:44.970 --> 21:46.096
Fifty-fifty!

21:47.556 --> 21:49.349
Gary, that was really good.

21:49.433 --> 21:52.036
You should have your own restaurant.
I think you'd really pack 'em in.

21:52.060 --> 21:54.021
Oof. That's always been my dream, man.

21:54.104 --> 21:56.690
My own place right on Union Square.

21:57.190 --> 21:58.775
But how am I gonna make that happen?

21:58.859 --> 22:01.069
These other chefs,
they go to the best culinary schools,

22:01.153 --> 22:02.633
they got all the right connections...

22:07.492 --> 22:09.369
Ginny, what are you doing?

22:09.453 --> 22:10.537
I'm leaving.

22:10.620 --> 22:13.874
If I go back now, I can maybe get back
in time to let Faison off the hook.

22:13.957 --> 22:17.961
Stop. Faison's not gonna care
one way or the other, and you know that.

22:18.045 --> 22:21.631
You lied to me, Coop! "The hot couple"?

22:21.715 --> 22:24.051
The only reason that I didn't tell you
about Katie before

22:24.134 --> 22:26.428
is because that's so far in the past.

22:26.511 --> 22:28.764
I wanted to make things easier for you.

22:29.389 --> 22:31.808
Besides, it was just one kiss.

22:31.892 --> 22:33.977
Abby said it was two kisses!

22:34.561 --> 22:37.814
One, two, buckle my shoe.

22:40.776 --> 22:43.820
Three, four, close the door.

22:47.032 --> 22:50.285
Five, six, pick up sticks.

22:51.578 --> 22:53.205
Do you see where I'm going with this?

22:54.956 --> 22:59.419
I'm sorry I wasn't truthful with you,
Ginny. Will you forgive me?

23:00.128 --> 23:05.425
Coop, you know I can't stay mad at you.
Come here.

23:08.762 --> 23:10.889
- So you'll stay?
- Are there any other camp flings

23:10.972 --> 23:12.015
I should know about?

23:12.808 --> 23:18.105
The only flings you need to worry about
are the flings of the Frisbee

23:18.897 --> 23:23.610
when we all gather on the main lawn later
this afternoon to play ultimate Frisbee.

23:23.693 --> 23:25.987
I'm in.

23:29.825 --> 23:31.952
Jesus, Gene. What happened to you?

23:32.035 --> 23:33.203
Life.

23:34.287 --> 23:35.580
Thanks, baby.

23:36.289 --> 23:39.042
What do you want, Mitch?
Can't you see I'm busy?

23:39.126 --> 23:40.836
You gotta come back to camp.

23:43.213 --> 23:45.507
I left camp behind years ago...

23:47.217 --> 23:48.677
when I was fired.

23:48.760 --> 23:50.679
What did you expect would happen?

23:51.680 --> 23:53.348
You went rogue.

23:53.431 --> 23:54.659
The menu would say grilled cheese

23:54.683 --> 23:56.518
and you'd make a taco.

23:56.601 --> 24:00.021
Or the menu would say hamburgers
and you'd make a taco.

24:00.105 --> 24:02.399
Or the menu would say chicken soup
and you'd make...

24:02.482 --> 24:04.067
Tacos!

24:05.068 --> 24:06.611
I know what I did!

24:07.696 --> 24:10.448
And don't give me
your holier-than-thou crap.

24:12.826 --> 24:16.246
Beth cared about you
even after you became a can,

24:16.329 --> 24:18.123
and how did you repay her?

24:18.915 --> 24:21.519
You sucked and fucked your way
through every waitress in New England.

24:21.543 --> 24:23.879
You have no idea
what my life has been like.

24:23.962 --> 24:26.173
Oh! Stop it!

24:26.256 --> 24:28.675
After the incident,
I spent years in physical therapy,

24:28.758 --> 24:30.177
just learning how to walk.

24:30.260 --> 24:32.262
I still can't type.

24:32.971 --> 24:35.015
Don't you dare judge me.

24:35.098 --> 24:37.559
And don't you dare judge me!

24:38.602 --> 24:40.187
Gene, I didn't come here to fight you.

24:43.857 --> 24:47.235
Well, then I guess
you came to the wrong Winnebago!

24:58.955 --> 25:01.958
Get a goddamn hold
of yourself, Gene!

25:04.502 --> 25:09.966
I don't want you here, Mitch!
Whatever it is you came for...

25:11.509 --> 25:13.220
I have nothing for you.

25:13.303 --> 25:18.600
You may hate my guts,
but I know that you love Camp Firewood.

25:18.683 --> 25:22.437
Now, are you gonna be part of the problem,
or are you the solution?

25:25.774 --> 25:26.900
I'm in.

25:26.983 --> 25:28.193
Thank God.

25:28.276 --> 25:31.154
If we do this, we're gonna need some help.

25:31.238 --> 25:33.531
