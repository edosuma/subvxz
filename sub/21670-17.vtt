WEBVTT

00:00.200 --> 00:01.966
<i>Previously on Hell's Kitchen...</i>

00:02.001 --> 00:03.018
Get ready.

00:03.059 --> 00:04.760
Ja'nel competed
in her first challenge

00:04.794 --> 00:05.827
as a member of the blue team.

00:05.862 --> 00:07.596
Hell yeah,

00:07.630 --> 00:08.931
blue team might actually
pull this off.

00:08.965 --> 00:10.899
It was the three-entree relay.

00:10.934 --> 00:12.267
Three stunning entrees.

00:12.302 --> 00:13.936
<i>Only one of you will be
in the kitchen at a time.</i>

00:13.970 --> 00:16.038
And while
both teams struggled...

00:16.072 --> 00:19.107
Chef Ramsay is literally putting
out fires in both kitchens.

00:19.142 --> 00:20.709
With the help
of their newest member...

00:20.743 --> 00:22.077
We can do this, guys.

00:22.111 --> 00:24.012
The blue team
managed to do something

00:24.047 --> 00:25.614
they had only done
once before...

00:25.648 --> 00:27.249
Congratulations.
Unbelievable.

00:27.283 --> 00:30.085
Win a challenge...
Yes, we did it!

00:30.119 --> 00:32.654
While the red team
got a rare taste of defeat.

00:32.689 --> 00:35.257
It's a disgrace.

00:35.291 --> 00:37.359
At dinner,
with Jon and Ja'nel

00:37.393 --> 00:38.927
working together
on appetizers...

00:38.962 --> 00:40.262
Walking risotto.

00:40.296 --> 00:41.830
The blue kitchen
seemed unstoppable.

00:41.864 --> 00:43.298
Keep it up.
Until...

00:43.333 --> 00:45.667
Stop, everybody.
Zach's overdone meat...

00:45.702 --> 00:47.502
Zach's lamb's burning.

00:47.537 --> 00:48.870
Brought the
kitchen to a screeching halt.

00:48.905 --> 00:51.273
At this stage of the game,
pick it up or off!

00:51.307 --> 00:53.442
And his inability
to communicate with his team...

00:53.476 --> 00:56.078
Zach. Zach. Hello?

00:56.112 --> 00:58.380
Seemed to make matters worse.
You're not listening.

00:58.414 --> 01:00.415
But he did
recover towards the end.

01:00.450 --> 01:02.050
Beautifully cooked.

01:02.085 --> 01:04.286
And the blue team
completed a respectable service.

01:04.319 --> 01:06.388
Ja'nel, thank you for rockin' out.
Happy to be here, Jon.

01:06.422 --> 01:07.589
In the red kitchen, Susan...

01:07.624 --> 01:09.324
Very nice, Susan.

01:09.359 --> 01:11.193
Got the dinner service
off to a good start on appetizers.

01:11.227 --> 01:12.394
Aah!

01:12.428 --> 01:13.895
But Cyndi's lobster tails...

01:13.930 --> 01:16.198
Look, it
bounces off the wall!

01:16.232 --> 01:17.766
All of you, come here!

01:17.800 --> 01:18.834
Put the whole
team in the doghouse.

01:18.868 --> 01:20.936
You're screwing the red team!

01:20.970 --> 01:23.038
Mary's perfect Wellingtons...
Very nice.

01:23.072 --> 01:24.806
Got the red
kitchen back on track.

01:24.841 --> 01:27.142
Good job.
Chef Ramsay had good news...

01:27.176 --> 01:29.511
We have two winning teams.

01:29.545 --> 01:32.214
And bad news.
I'll only be giving out

01:32.248 --> 01:33.949
four black jackets.

01:33.983 --> 01:35.284
One nominee from the red team,

01:35.318 --> 01:36.918
one nominee from the blue team.

01:36.953 --> 01:38.453
The blue
team's decision was easy.

01:38.488 --> 01:39.988
Zach.

01:40.023 --> 01:40.989
But when the
red team couldn't agree...

01:41.024 --> 01:42.057
Susan.
Mary.

01:42.091 --> 01:43.592
Cyndi.

01:43.626 --> 01:45.027
Chef Ramsay consulted
their former teammate.

01:45.061 --> 01:48.297
Ja'nel, who is
the weakest chef?

01:48.331 --> 01:49.798
Susan.
In the end,

01:49.832 --> 01:51.767
Zach was sent packing...
Good luck.

01:51.801 --> 01:54.202
And was forced
to say good-bye to his dream

01:54.237 --> 01:56.905
of becoming head chef
of Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill

01:56.939 --> 01:58.140
at Caesars Palace.

02:02.679 --> 02:03.879
* Fire *

02:03.913 --> 02:06.415
Whoa!

02:06.449 --> 02:09.418
* The way you swerve and curve *

02:09.452 --> 02:11.186
* really wrecks my nerves *

02:11.220 --> 02:13.388
* and I'm so excited, child *
ohh!

02:13.423 --> 02:15.957
<i>Go, Jon!</i>

02:15.992 --> 02:18.593
* When you take
what you've got *

02:18.628 --> 02:20.362
* and, girl, you've got a lot *

02:20.396 --> 02:21.963
* you're really smokin', child *

02:24.701 --> 02:27.436
* When you're hot, you're hot *

02:27.470 --> 02:29.404
* you really shoot your shot *

02:29.439 --> 02:31.406
* you're dynamite, child *

02:31.441 --> 02:32.908
* yeah *

02:32.942 --> 02:36.278
* well, I can tell
by your game *

02:36.312 --> 02:39.047
* you're gonna start a flame *

02:39.082 --> 02:42.517
* of love, baby, baby *

02:42.552 --> 02:45.620
* the way you push, push *

02:45.655 --> 02:47.255
* lets me know that *

02:47.290 --> 02:48.390
Hey, hey!

02:48.424 --> 02:49.524
* You're good *

02:49.559 --> 02:51.159
* you're gonna get your wish *

02:51.194 --> 02:52.527
* oh, no *

02:52.562 --> 02:54.596
* fire *

02:54.630 --> 02:56.331
* what I said, child *

02:56.366 --> 02:59.134
* oww, fire *

02:59.168 --> 03:02.070
* uh-huh *

03:02.105 --> 03:05.474
* got me burnin',
got me burnin' *

03:07.052 --> 03:10.045
<i>And now,
the continuation of Hell's Kitchen.</i>

03:10.079 --> 03:12.547
Now, get out of here.

03:16.786 --> 03:18.653
I think I peed my pants
a little bit.

03:18.688 --> 03:20.088
Whew.

03:20.123 --> 03:22.691
I really thought
I was going home.

03:22.725 --> 03:25.160
Susan, you're not
leaving here tonight.

03:25.194 --> 03:29.564
Back in line.

03:29.599 --> 03:33.135
I am relieved, drained.

03:33.169 --> 03:35.437
Just like a roller coaster
of emotions.

03:35.471 --> 03:37.406
Are you ever gonna change
your opinion of me?

03:37.440 --> 03:38.640
What can I do to help you?

03:38.674 --> 03:40.308
I don't think that

03:40.343 --> 03:42.210
anyone is weak.

03:42.245 --> 03:45.113
I can only nitpick at
the little, teeny, tiny things.

03:45.148 --> 03:46.648
I'm not gonna spare
your feelings

03:46.682 --> 03:48.417
to give you my honest opinion.

03:48.451 --> 03:50.585
And that's just how it is...
take it or leave it.

03:50.620 --> 03:51.853
You know what I mean?

03:51.888 --> 03:54.423
It really
frustrates me to no end

03:54.457 --> 03:56.958
that Ja'nel thinks that
I can't handle the pressure.

03:56.993 --> 03:58.326
I think she needs
to get her eyes checked.

03:58.361 --> 04:01.029
Maybe she needs to change
her prescription on her glasses.

04:01.063 --> 04:02.297
I'm over it,
but I swear to God,

04:02.331 --> 04:05.233
if you guys call me weak again,
I'm gonna kill you.

04:05.268 --> 04:08.003
I now feel like I'm really
out of the loop.

04:08.037 --> 04:10.038
You are.
I really am.

04:10.072 --> 04:12.107
Estrogen everywhere!

04:12.141 --> 04:14.576
Being the rooster
among the hens, man,

04:14.610 --> 04:18.313
it's not exactly the fantasy
that you think of.

04:18.346 --> 04:21.149
I think I, like...

04:23.286 --> 04:25.320
Oh, we're gonna have
to do our toes tomorrow.

04:26.722 --> 04:28.623
I'm just kinda waiting
for a pillow fight to break out,

04:28.658 --> 04:31.293
and then, all of a sudden,
I'm gonna wake up

04:31.327 --> 04:32.727
to four girls trying
to hold me down

04:32.762 --> 04:33.895
and put makeup on me.

04:33.930 --> 04:34.896
Look at that.
What is this?

04:34.931 --> 04:36.298
Chocolate?

04:36.332 --> 04:37.499
All right, I'm going
to bed.

04:37.533 --> 04:39.935
<i>Nighty night.</i>

04:39.969 --> 04:43.538
Oh!
Peace and quiet.

04:43.573 --> 04:47.008
Tom's always like, "How come
you don't want to get a Brazilian?"

04:47.043 --> 04:49.644
I was like, "You try ripping
all the hair out of your butt."

04:49.679 --> 04:51.046
<i>Ouch.</i>

04:51.080 --> 04:54.649
I just started waxing,
like, my pubic region.

04:54.684 --> 04:56.785
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up!

04:56.819 --> 04:58.153
These walls are
pretty thin, Susan.

04:58.187 --> 05:00.255
Do you trim it?

05:00.289 --> 05:02.624
Oh, my God, are we
really talking about this?

05:02.658 --> 05:03.859
Oh, my God.
Yes, we are.

05:03.893 --> 05:05.560
Hey, that's awesome.

05:05.595 --> 05:06.795
Good night, everybody.

05:06.829 --> 05:10.765
<i>Good night.
Sweet dreams.</i>

05:10.800 --> 05:13.268
After an uncomfortable
night in the dorms for Jon...

05:13.302 --> 05:14.269
I'm coming, I'm coming.

05:14.303 --> 05:15.470
The final five hurry

05:15.505 --> 05:16.938
down to the kitchen...
Good morning.

05:16.973 --> 05:18.573
Good morning, chef.

05:18.608 --> 05:21.042
With one thing on their minds.

05:21.077 --> 05:22.210
I'm sure you're all wondering

05:22.245 --> 05:25.514
when are you gonna get
your black jackets?

05:25.548 --> 05:27.849
I'm sorry to say...

05:27.884 --> 05:29.484
there's one more
important thing

05:29.519 --> 05:32.287
I need to do
before that can happen.

05:32.321 --> 05:34.189
And it begins with this video.

05:34.223 --> 05:35.457
Yes, chef.

05:35.491 --> 05:37.292
I don't know
what we're about to watch,

05:37.326 --> 05:39.461
but I'm ready.
I'm watching with intent.

05:39.495 --> 05:42.464
Hi, Cynd.
Oh, my God.

05:42.498 --> 05:43.598
Hi, Cynd.

05:43.633 --> 05:44.733
<i>Your dog just wanted to say</i>

05:44.767 --> 05:45.934
he's very proud of you,

05:45.968 --> 05:47.936
he misses you...
he misses his mommy.

05:47.970 --> 05:51.172
Oh, my God, I wasn't expecting
it to be my family.

05:51.207 --> 05:52.841
We're all proud of you.

05:52.875 --> 05:54.776
<i>We all miss you very much</i>

05:54.810 --> 05:57.145
and can't wait
till you come home

05:57.179 --> 05:59.648
<i>and can't wait
to see you again.</i>

05:59.682 --> 06:02.117
I miss my family like crazy.

06:02.151 --> 06:05.987
It feels so good to hear
from my mom and my sister.

06:06.022 --> 06:10.692
Love you. Bye.

06:10.726 --> 06:13.261
Oh, my God, I almost
start losing it

06:13.296 --> 06:14.763
'cause I know
how she feels, man.

06:14.797 --> 06:16.264
I really miss my family.

06:16.299 --> 06:18.433
Hi, my Jonny angel.
I'm so proud of you.

06:18.467 --> 06:20.368
<i>Glad you made it so far.</i>

06:20.403 --> 06:22.704
I can't wait to see you
and give you a big hug

06:22.738 --> 06:24.940
bring it home, Jon.
You're my heart and soul.

06:24.974 --> 06:28.043
I'm trying everything I can
to just hold it back,

06:28.077 --> 06:29.678
but, God, it's so good
to see them.

06:29.712 --> 06:32.447
Hi, Ja'nel. I'm so happy
you made it this far.

06:32.481 --> 06:37.452
I can't imagine all the things
that you've gone through.

06:37.486 --> 06:39.854
<i>But I hope that you continue
with your success.</i>

06:39.889 --> 06:42.624
My family's support means
the entire world to me.

06:42.658 --> 06:44.559
And I could feel
their positive vibes

06:44.594 --> 06:45.760
through that television screen.

06:45.795 --> 06:47.495
And it just feels so good.

06:47.530 --> 06:49.164
Hey, Susan,
I hope you're having fun.

06:49.198 --> 06:51.399
<i>I wish I could be there
to support you,</i>

06:51.434 --> 06:52.734
but I know you're doing great.

06:52.768 --> 06:55.003
<i>I'm so proud of you.
I miss you, I love you.</i>

06:55.037 --> 06:56.237
Good luck, sis.

06:56.272 --> 06:58.740
I have a message
from my little brother.

06:58.774 --> 07:00.942
It feels so good
to see his face

07:00.977 --> 07:01.943
and to hear his voice.

07:01.978 --> 07:03.678
Mary, it's your brother.

07:03.713 --> 07:05.547
<i>Yay.</i>

07:05.581 --> 07:08.950
I am so excited that I get
to do this video for you.

07:08.985 --> 07:11.086
I hope that you continue
to do great things

07:11.120 --> 07:13.054
and that you make it
all the way to the top.

07:13.089 --> 07:16.157
You know what I'm sayin'?

07:16.192 --> 07:17.592
Wow, what a dude.

07:17.627 --> 07:20.261
I love you so much.

07:20.296 --> 07:21.663
Wow.

07:21.697 --> 07:23.431
Aww.

07:23.466 --> 07:24.899
Wasn't that wonderful?

07:24.934 --> 07:27.435
<i>Does that give you
extra motivation?</i>

07:27.470 --> 07:28.503
Yes, chef.
Yes.

07:28.537 --> 07:31.206
Absolutely, chef.

07:31.240 --> 07:34.175
Well, it's time
for your next challenge.

07:35.611 --> 07:38.046
Seeing that video message
is awesome,

07:38.080 --> 07:40.615
but not the way you should
go into a challenge.

07:40.650 --> 07:42.751
Chef Ramsay, are you really
doing this to us?

07:42.785 --> 07:45.320
And that challenge is...

07:45.354 --> 07:47.489
Oh, my God.

07:53.626 --> 07:55.961
After surprising
the final five

07:55.995 --> 07:57.629
with words of encouragement
from their families,

07:57.664 --> 08:01.066
chef Ramsay is ready
to get down to business.

08:01.100 --> 08:04.036
Well, it's time
for your next challenge.

08:04.070 --> 08:06.405
And that challenge is...

08:10.843 --> 08:12.911
Spend time with your family.
Oh, my God.

08:16.449 --> 08:18.584
Oh, my God, it's my family!

08:18.618 --> 08:19.885
Oh, God!

08:19.919 --> 08:22.321
Mom!

08:22.355 --> 08:24.957
Mom!

08:24.991 --> 08:26.425
Oh, my God.

08:26.459 --> 08:28.327
I just can't believe
they're here.

08:28.361 --> 08:30.596
I can't believe
my family is here.

08:30.630 --> 08:34.533
God, this is so hard.

08:38.638 --> 08:41.573
Seeing my family,
it's every emotion all at once.

08:41.607 --> 08:44.443
Joy, sadness, love.

08:44.477 --> 08:45.510
Everything.

08:45.545 --> 08:47.746
Oh, it's so good
to see you guys.

08:47.780 --> 08:49.381
Oh, my gosh.

08:49.415 --> 08:52.050
Hey, mom.
How are you?

08:52.085 --> 08:54.019
How are you?
I'm good. I'm good.

08:54.053 --> 08:57.322
Oh, my gosh! My mom's here,
my brother's here.

08:57.357 --> 09:00.158
Like, I didn't even
expect that.

09:03.196 --> 09:05.264
As happy as I am to see
my mom and my brother,

09:05.298 --> 09:07.466
I'm thinking a lot
about my husband.

09:07.500 --> 09:09.768
I really, really miss him.

09:09.802 --> 09:12.137
Where's Tom?
Is he in school, or...

09:12.171 --> 09:13.138
He's in school.

09:13.172 --> 09:14.606
Mmm.
I'm sorry.

09:14.641 --> 09:16.408
Take some valuable time-outs,

09:16.442 --> 09:19.478
<i>and enjoy yourselves
with your loved ones.</i>

09:19.512 --> 09:23.081
So this is a letter
that's from Tom.

09:23.116 --> 09:24.516
Aw.

09:24.550 --> 09:26.785
"Hi, honey,
I've missed you so much.

09:26.819 --> 09:29.621
"I'm so sorry I can't
be there right now

09:29.656 --> 09:31.590
"because all I want to do
is show you

09:31.624 --> 09:34.092
how proud I am of you
and how much I support you."

09:34.127 --> 09:36.194
I miss Tom so much.

09:36.229 --> 09:39.031
More than I have ever missed
anybody in my whole life.

09:39.065 --> 09:40.032
He's my best friend,

09:40.066 --> 09:41.733
you know, and so for me

09:41.768 --> 09:43.335
to not see him this whole time

09:43.369 --> 09:45.270
is really, really hard.

09:45.305 --> 09:47.606
Aw.
That's so cute.

09:47.640 --> 09:49.908
<i>Oh.
How you been, honey?</i>

09:49.942 --> 09:53.445
Oh, good, but it's tough.
Yeah?

09:53.479 --> 09:55.647
Yeah, but it is worth
every second.

09:55.682 --> 09:57.783
<i>I miss you.
How's Hayden?</i>

09:57.817 --> 09:59.584
<i>He's doing good.
You get to see him?</i>

09:59.619 --> 10:01.520
Yes. His first day of school.

10:01.554 --> 10:04.523
He was so proud.
Oh, honey,

10:04.557 --> 10:06.591
you'll get to see him soon.

10:06.626 --> 10:08.560
My little man Hayden,
he's one of the biggest things

10:08.594 --> 10:09.861
that I miss.

10:09.896 --> 10:11.096
His real dad died
when he was one,

10:11.130 --> 10:12.197
and he was my best friend.

10:12.231 --> 10:14.366
I missed his first day
of school, man.

10:14.400 --> 10:15.967
Oh, it's okay.
You'll get to see him.

10:16.002 --> 10:18.303
You've got to come by
and watch him get on the bus.

10:18.338 --> 10:20.238
<i>I will.
Yeah.</i>

10:20.273 --> 10:23.775
He's already been
through a lot.

10:23.810 --> 10:25.277
He's only five.

10:25.311 --> 10:26.945
I can't wait to see him.

10:26.979 --> 10:28.547
God, he's such a good kid.

10:28.581 --> 10:31.516
This entire journey, really,
is dedicated to Hayden.

10:31.551 --> 10:34.453
I mean,
we're not in black jackets yet,

10:34.487 --> 10:35.687
<i>and there's only five of us.</i>

10:35.722 --> 10:37.689
<i>We have to lose one more...
Okay.</i>

10:37.724 --> 10:39.925
<i>Before we can get to black.
Yeah.</i>

10:39.959 --> 10:40.926
You are in the top five.

10:40.960 --> 10:42.494
It's so...
You got this.

10:42.528 --> 10:45.364
I can't even tell you
the things that I've done.

10:45.398 --> 10:47.199
You guys are gonna be so proud.

10:47.233 --> 10:50.602
Having my family here
to just say,

10:50.636 --> 10:52.270
"I'm proud of you.
I love you.

10:52.305 --> 10:55.674
"And I know you're doing
everything you can.

10:55.708 --> 10:58.276
You just have
a little bit further to go,"

10:58.311 --> 10:59.778
it just means so much.

10:59.812 --> 11:01.279
Like, having you guys here...

11:01.314 --> 11:04.182
like, you guys are inside
of Hell's Kitchen.

11:04.217 --> 11:05.884
Isn't it crazy? Like...
Yeah.

11:05.918 --> 11:07.252
We're, like,
in the home stretch.

11:07.286 --> 11:08.553
Yes.

11:08.588 --> 11:09.988
I've won
the most challenges ever.

11:10.022 --> 11:11.223
Congratulations.

11:11.257 --> 11:12.858
I want to make
chef Ramsay proud,

11:12.892 --> 11:14.693
but I really want
to make my mom proud.

11:14.727 --> 11:16.461
So happy.

11:16.496 --> 11:18.797
To see her, you know,
smiling and happy,

11:18.831 --> 11:19.998
it just really warms my heart.

11:20.032 --> 11:22.667
I'm just staying focused...
Wonderful.

11:22.702 --> 11:24.469
And, like, cooking my ass off.
Sorry, mom.

11:27.106 --> 11:28.473
You don't want to hear
all these f-bombs

11:28.508 --> 11:29.641
I've been dropping around here.

11:29.675 --> 11:31.576
It's my mother, and, you know,

11:31.611 --> 11:33.545
she probably would prefer
for me to have

11:33.579 --> 11:35.147
a, you know,
dainty little mouth.

11:35.181 --> 11:36.982
Me and Jon,
we kicked ass.

11:37.016 --> 11:38.884
Sorry, mom.
And so I've, like,

11:38.918 --> 11:40.619
had a day.
Sorry, mom.

11:40.653 --> 11:42.454
You know,
that kitchen's intense,

11:42.488 --> 11:44.289
and comes out.
Sorry, mom.

11:44.323 --> 11:46.358
And you just can't
help it sometimes.

11:46.392 --> 11:48.627
You know I can do it.
I'm gonna do it.

11:48.661 --> 11:49.928
Sorry, mom.

11:49.962 --> 11:51.997
Sorry, mom.

11:52.031 --> 11:54.132
You never had a problem
with expressing yourself.

11:56.402 --> 11:58.503
<i>I'm here, I'm doing this
for me, you know? Right.</i>

11:58.538 --> 11:59.971
And I haven't ever
done that before.

12:00.006 --> 12:03.308
You deserve it. You deserve it.
Thank you.

12:04.811 --> 12:07.646
I know that there is gonna be
some sort of crazy challenge

12:07.680 --> 12:09.781
in order for us to make it
to black jackets.

12:09.816 --> 12:12.918
So I'm really nervous,
but I'm motivated and excited,

12:12.952 --> 12:14.119
especially with my family here.

12:14.153 --> 12:15.353
<i>I bet this is, like,
the first time</i>

12:15.388 --> 12:16.521
<i>you've actually been able
to relax</i>

12:16.556 --> 12:17.989
and take a deep breath and...

12:18.024 --> 12:20.492
We don't ever get to sit in these chairs.

12:20.526 --> 12:23.295
Um, sorry for interrupting
this valuable moment,

12:23.329 --> 12:25.964
<i>but, families and chefs,
would you be so kind</i>

12:25.998 --> 12:27.566
<i>to step up and gather
at the hot plate, please?</i>

12:27.600 --> 12:28.867
Thank you.

12:28.901 --> 12:32.304
Oh, my gosh, what does he have
up his sleeve?

12:32.338 --> 12:33.772
Like, I'm not prepared
for this.

12:33.806 --> 12:36.475
Oh, no,
the challenge is coming.

12:36.509 --> 12:38.076
Um, chefs, families,

12:38.110 --> 12:41.213
<i>we still have some very,
very important business</i>

12:41.247 --> 12:43.315
to take care of.

12:43.349 --> 12:46.518
Chefs, I told you I'd be
only giving out

12:46.552 --> 12:48.119
four black jackets.

12:48.154 --> 12:51.356
And, unfortunately,
there are five of you.

12:51.390 --> 12:55.227
Chef, please,
you can't fly our families

12:55.261 --> 12:56.761
all the way out here

12:56.796 --> 12:59.764
just to send one of us home
with them.

12:59.799 --> 13:01.399
This is gonna be humiliating.

13:01.434 --> 13:03.702
As I look at you
with your families,

13:03.736 --> 13:06.872
I realize right now
that any one of you

13:06.906 --> 13:08.707
<i>can win Hell's Kitchen.</i>

13:08.741 --> 13:11.443
And that is why...

13:11.477 --> 13:14.012
all five of you...
Oh, God.

13:14.046 --> 13:15.580
Are gonna get black jackets.
Well done.

13:21.420 --> 13:23.889
Aah! Oh, my God!

13:23.923 --> 13:25.891
Wait, what?
Wait, what did you just say?

13:25.925 --> 13:27.192
We're all getting black jackets?

13:27.226 --> 13:28.760
Oh, my goodness.

13:28.794 --> 13:31.263
Aah! Chef Ramsay,
why do you do that?

13:31.297 --> 13:33.565
You, like, take us up
and then down.

13:33.599 --> 13:34.966
And then back up again.

13:35.001 --> 13:36.735
Like, I'm gonna explode
right now.

13:36.769 --> 13:40.839
Oh, man, this day is getting,
like, crazy good.

13:41.874 --> 13:43.441
Oh, man.

13:43.476 --> 13:45.010
Stop crying, Cyndi.

13:45.044 --> 13:46.044
I never cry.

13:46.078 --> 13:47.045
No, she never cries.

13:47.079 --> 13:49.047
I've ever seen her cry.

13:49.081 --> 13:50.048
Cyndi, you never cry?

13:50.082 --> 13:52.384
At home, I'm actually
the biggest baby,

13:52.418 --> 13:54.386
but here, I've tried to be
so hard exterior,

13:54.420 --> 13:56.187
and I'm just so overwhelmed.

13:56.222 --> 13:57.389
<i>I really am.
Glad to hear it.</i>

13:57.423 --> 13:59.291
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,

13:59.325 --> 14:02.827
our first recipient
of this amazing black jacket

14:02.862 --> 14:05.363
belongs to Jon.
Step forward, please.

14:06.399 --> 14:07.365
Good job, Jon.

14:07.400 --> 14:08.500
<i>Jon!</i>

14:08.534 --> 14:09.734
Thank you so much.
Good job.

14:09.769 --> 14:10.902
Absolutely brilliant.
Well done. Thank you.

14:10.937 --> 14:12.704
This is great news.
Ja'nel.

14:12.738 --> 14:13.738
<i>Go, Ja'nel!
Good job, Ja'nel.</i>

14:13.773 --> 14:15.540
Well done.
Go, Ja'nel!

14:15.575 --> 14:16.541
Thank you, chef.

14:16.576 --> 14:18.243
No one's going home right now.

14:18.277 --> 14:19.711
Well done, my darling. Good job.
Thank you, chef. Thank you so much.

14:19.745 --> 14:21.413
No one's getting embarrassed
in front of their family.

14:21.447 --> 14:23.615
Yay, Susan!
Well done.

14:23.649 --> 14:24.849
And all of our families
are here

14:24.884 --> 14:26.851
to see
this monumental occasion.

14:26.886 --> 14:28.019
Well done.
Thank you, chef. Thank you.

14:28.054 --> 14:29.087
Well done, well done,
well done.

14:29.121 --> 14:31.122
It's really, really exciting.

14:31.157 --> 14:32.857
How special
do those jackets feel?

14:32.892 --> 14:34.426
Amazing.
Amazing.

14:34.460 --> 14:35.594
<i>Don't they?
Wow.</i>

14:35.628 --> 14:37.395
<i>Good.</i>

14:37.430 --> 14:41.499
I'm sorry to say it's time to
say good-bye to your loved ones.

14:41.534 --> 14:42.767
I'd like all five of you
to head up to the dorms,

14:42.802 --> 14:44.135
<i>get those black jackets on,</i>

14:44.170 --> 14:46.871
because your next
individual challenge

14:46.906 --> 14:48.406
is coming up.

14:48.441 --> 14:50.308
Bye. I love you.

14:50.343 --> 14:53.178
Bye. Love you guys.
Bye, guys.

14:53.212 --> 14:54.279
After all the
I've been through,

14:54.313 --> 14:56.014
all the punishments,
all the hard work,

14:56.048 --> 14:58.717
everything that's happened to me
during this competition,

14:58.751 --> 15:01.553
I'm holding this black jacket.
Here I am.

15:01.587 --> 15:04.889
All worth it.
Every single second.

15:04.924 --> 15:07.058
<i>I'm gonna win Hell's Kitchen.
I'll be in Vegas, baby.</i>

15:07.093 --> 15:09.194
Come see me sometime.

15:15.322 --> 15:17.823
After a surprise
visit from their families,

15:17.858 --> 15:20.826
the final five chefs have
received black jackets...

15:20.861 --> 15:21.994
Wow.

15:22.029 --> 15:23.162
And are eager to prove

15:23.197 --> 15:24.664
that they deserve to keep them.

15:24.698 --> 15:26.465
Look at those jackets.

15:26.500 --> 15:28.935
Susan, how does it feel?
Perfect. Fits just perfect.

15:28.969 --> 15:31.437
Wearing this black jacket
is bringing out

15:31.471 --> 15:34.440
an even fiercer side of me
as a competitor.

15:34.474 --> 15:36.008
I have to keep my eye
on the prize,

15:36.043 --> 15:37.210
and I'm ready to bring it.

15:37.244 --> 15:39.879
From now on in,
in your challenges,

15:39.913 --> 15:41.914
you are going to be
working individually.

15:41.949 --> 15:45.017
It is
such an amazing accomplishment

15:45.052 --> 15:46.786
to be wearing
this black jacket.

15:46.820 --> 15:49.822
I mean, my goal was
to get to black jackets.

15:49.856 --> 15:52.358
My new goal is to win it all.

15:52.392 --> 15:55.695
Before we begin
our next challenge,

15:55.729 --> 15:57.930
I'm gonna give you a hint
of what your reward is

15:57.965 --> 15:58.931
<i>before you compete.
Oh.</i>

15:58.966 --> 15:59.932
The winner

15:59.967 --> 16:02.335
will get to spend the afternoon

16:02.369 --> 16:03.703
with their family.

16:03.737 --> 16:05.638
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh.

16:05.672 --> 16:06.739
That's so nice.

16:06.773 --> 16:08.641
Spend the whole day
with your family...

16:08.675 --> 16:10.409
I mean, oh, my God,

16:10.444 --> 16:12.078
I would love to spend
the afternoon with them.

16:12.112 --> 16:13.312
It would mean everything.

16:13.347 --> 16:14.747
Biggest reward.
Best reward.

16:14.781 --> 16:17.450
Excited?
Yes, chef.

16:17.484 --> 16:20.253
But first, you have to win
the challenge, right?

16:20.287 --> 16:21.254
Yes, chef.

16:21.288 --> 16:24.657
Which is a real
pressure cooker.

16:31.098 --> 16:33.499
<i>A real pressure cooker.</i>

16:33.533 --> 16:36.002
Literally.

16:36.036 --> 16:38.938
I have never used
a pressure cooker before.

16:38.972 --> 16:41.107
I've actually never used
a pressure cooker before.

16:41.141 --> 16:43.242
I've never used
a pressure cooker before.

16:43.277 --> 16:45.144
I've never even used
a pressure cooker before.

16:45.178 --> 16:47.780
I have a pressure cooker
at home...

16:49.049 --> 16:51.017
So I'm really excited
for this challenge.

16:51.051 --> 16:52.585
That's right,
your next challenge,

16:52.619 --> 16:54.053
<i>you'll be working
with pressure cookers.</i>

16:54.087 --> 16:55.554
A pressure cooker, as you know,

16:55.589 --> 16:58.491
it cooks rapidly.

16:58.525 --> 17:00.226
It's an amazing way
of tenderizing cheap cuts

17:00.260 --> 17:01.394
and adding great flavor.

17:01.428 --> 17:02.795
<i>All right?
Yes, chef.</i>

17:02.829 --> 17:04.664
I am looking to see
which of you

17:04.698 --> 17:06.732
can create a five-star dish

17:06.767 --> 17:08.800
from a inexpensive cut of meat.

17:08.835 --> 17:11.304
Yes, chef.
Good. One by one,

17:11.338 --> 17:13.204
I want you to open that lid

17:13.240 --> 17:14.940
<i>and find out what
you'll be cooking with.</i>

17:14.974 --> 17:16.342
Got it?
Yes, chef.

17:16.376 --> 17:18.210
<i>Cyndi, step up in front
of the table,</i>

17:18.244 --> 17:21.946
<i>choose a pressure cooker.
Any one.</i>

17:24.651 --> 17:26.185
<i>Pork roast.
Nice.</i>

17:26.219 --> 17:27.520
It's gonna be a challenge
to take something

17:27.554 --> 17:31.190
of such a cheap, tough cut,
use a pressure cooker,

17:31.224 --> 17:32.992
but still make it look elegant
when it comes out.

17:33.026 --> 17:35.094
Jon, off you go.
Yes, chef.

17:35.128 --> 17:36.495
I'm like,
dude, I want short ribs.

17:36.530 --> 17:39.298
I know I can make
an amazing dish with short ribs.

17:39.333 --> 17:41.200
Lamb leg, chef.
Aw, !

17:41.234 --> 17:42.968
Oh, nice.
Nice.

17:43.003 --> 17:44.470
<i>Nice.
Very cool.</i>

17:44.504 --> 17:46.639
Well, you know what?
I can work with lamb leg.

17:46.673 --> 17:48.941
I know exactly
how the works.

17:48.975 --> 17:51.744
We're gonna get it on.
Oh, pork belly!

17:51.778 --> 17:52.845
<i>Pork belly?
Oh, really?</i>

17:52.879 --> 17:54.246
<i>Nice.
Wow.</i>

17:54.281 --> 17:55.481
Really good.
Very cool.

17:55.515 --> 17:57.049
I love pork belly.

17:57.084 --> 18:01.754
I've eaten it many times,
but I've never cooked it myself.

18:01.788 --> 18:05.758
So this is definitely
gonna be a challenge for me.

18:05.792 --> 18:07.960
<i>Goat ribs.
Goat ribs.</i>

18:07.994 --> 18:09.195
<i>Wow.
Yum.</i>

18:09.229 --> 18:11.230
There's not that much meat
on there,

18:11.264 --> 18:12.798
and I know it's gonna be
really tough.

18:12.833 --> 18:14.533
Mary.

18:14.568 --> 18:16.869
Ooh, short ribs!
Short ribs.

18:16.903 --> 18:18.871
This is the one
I was secretly hoping for.

18:18.905 --> 18:21.107
Another chef's
dream there, right?

18:21.141 --> 18:22.108
Yes, chef.

18:22.142 --> 18:23.976
You've all got 45 minutes

18:24.010 --> 18:25.277
<i>to grab your pressure cooker</i>

18:25.312 --> 18:29.348
and create a absolutely
stunning five-star dish.

18:29.383 --> 18:31.684
<i>Are you ready?
Yes, chef.</i>

18:31.718 --> 18:35.087
Your 45 minutes starts...
Now.

18:35.122 --> 18:37.022
<i>Let's go.</i>

18:37.057 --> 18:40.426
In the black jackets'
first individual challenge...

18:40.460 --> 18:42.294
Coming up from behind you.
Behind you, behind you.

18:42.329 --> 18:43.796
Chef Ramsay
has tasked the chefs

18:43.830 --> 18:47.533
with taking an inexpensive cut of meat...
Onions.

18:47.567 --> 18:49.201
And skillfully combining it

18:49.236 --> 18:50.703
with their choice
of ingredients...

18:50.737 --> 18:52.304
Is this okra?

18:52.339 --> 18:55.241
To create a dish worthy
of a fine dining restaurant.

18:55.275 --> 18:58.644
I'm thinking
an old French rustic style.

18:58.678 --> 18:59.945
Fennel and leeks,

18:59.980 --> 19:02.248
they're two of my most
favorite ingredients.

19:02.282 --> 19:04.750
I want to infuse those flavors
into the pork.

19:04.785 --> 19:09.255
I hope that that does
help me stand out in a good way.

19:09.289 --> 19:11.023
Immediately, I'm like
boeuf bourguignon.

19:11.057 --> 19:12.625
It's like a French beef stew.

19:12.659 --> 19:15.361
I'm gonna do okra, potatoes.

19:15.395 --> 19:16.529
I don't see okra very often,

19:16.563 --> 19:18.330
and it's such a good veg
to use.

19:18.365 --> 19:19.999
And I know exactly
what I'm gonna do with it.

19:21.902 --> 19:24.236
I'm thinking I really wanna go
early fall.

19:24.271 --> 19:26.038
I love squash with pork.

19:26.072 --> 19:28.541
I mean, it's just gonna be
such a nice dish.

19:28.575 --> 19:30.576
30 minutes to go, yes?
Yes, chef.

19:30.610 --> 19:33.979
Make it count.

19:34.014 --> 19:36.015
Mary focuses so hard.

19:39.085 --> 19:41.020
She just can't help
but have her tongue

19:41.054 --> 19:42.922
start to slowly
creep out of her mouth.

19:42.956 --> 19:44.523
You know...

19:44.558 --> 19:46.592
And it just gets
further and further.

19:46.626 --> 19:50.629
And she's totally
letting it fly today.

19:50.664 --> 19:51.764
Mary, get your tongue
back in your mouth.

19:51.798 --> 19:54.867
You don't want to drool
on your food.

19:54.901 --> 19:56.936
Just over 25 minutes
to go, yes?

19:56.970 --> 19:58.804
Yes, chef.

19:59.906 --> 20:03.442
Just doesn't feel
tender enough.

20:03.477 --> 20:05.077
There is one rule
with pressure cooking...

20:05.111 --> 20:09.548
do not open the lid.

20:09.583 --> 20:11.317
Every time you open it,
the pressure drops.

20:11.351 --> 20:12.318
If you close it,
you have to wait for it

20:12.352 --> 20:13.319
to build back up.

20:13.353 --> 20:16.489
Don't open the lid.

20:19.259 --> 20:22.027
<i>Susan, what the heck?
Don't open it again.</i>

20:23.864 --> 20:27.800
Susan, do not open that lid.

20:27.834 --> 20:29.935
While Susan
may have flipped her lid

20:29.970 --> 20:32.271
one too many times...
Damn steamer.

20:32.305 --> 20:33.439
The competition...

20:33.473 --> 20:34.773
It's, like,
blowing right in my face.

20:34.808 --> 20:36.575
Is definitely heating up.

20:36.610 --> 20:38.310
Is anyone using the steamer?
If not, can we turn it off?

20:38.345 --> 20:40.546
I'm using it right now.
Okay.

20:40.580 --> 20:42.781
The steamer's on,
Mary's using it for potatoes,

20:42.816 --> 20:45.918
and this thing is just
pouring steam

20:45.952 --> 20:47.086
directly into my face.

20:47.120 --> 20:48.554
I can't even see
my cutting board.

20:48.588 --> 20:50.022
15 minutes to go, guys.
Yes?

20:50.056 --> 20:51.023
Yes, chef.

20:51.057 --> 20:55.661
man, like...

20:55.695 --> 20:57.530
yeah, I just can't see
what the I'm doing

20:57.564 --> 20:58.898
'cause of this steamer.

20:58.932 --> 21:02.401
Come on, Jon,
this isn't rocket science.

21:02.435 --> 21:04.436
Switch your station.
Want me to move you?

21:04.471 --> 21:07.072
Yeah.
Just get up and move.

21:09.175 --> 21:10.142
<i>Thank you, chef.</i>

21:10.176 --> 21:13.579
Duh. There you go.

21:13.613 --> 21:14.914
Somebody's burning.
I can smell it.

21:14.948 --> 21:18.250
burnt don't smell good.

21:18.285 --> 21:23.789
Oh, , I instantly
smell burnt.

21:23.823 --> 21:25.558
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

21:25.592 --> 21:26.992
This can't be happening
right now.

21:27.027 --> 21:29.061
I definitely underestimated
this pressure cooker

21:29.095 --> 21:31.196
a little bit.

21:31.231 --> 21:32.798
12 minutes to go.

21:32.832 --> 21:34.333
I'm completely
freakin' out, man.

21:34.367 --> 21:36.101
I totally freaked
the out.

21:36.136 --> 21:38.837
What the am I gonna do?

21:41.308 --> 21:43.509
You've got to leave the protein

21:43.543 --> 21:44.577
<i>cooking under pressure, right?</i>

21:44.611 --> 21:46.044
Well, I'm .

21:50.929 --> 21:52.930
In the pressure
cooker challenge...

21:52.965 --> 21:54.999
Damn steamer.
The final five chefs

21:55.033 --> 21:57.268
have a chance to impress
chef Ramsay.

21:57.302 --> 21:58.603
Somebody's burning.
I can smell it.

21:58.637 --> 22:00.571
But unfortunately for Jon...

22:00.606 --> 22:02.039
burnt don't smell good.

22:02.074 --> 22:04.342
His first few
hours in a black jacket

22:04.376 --> 22:06.377
are not going
according to plan.

22:07.579 --> 22:09.614
I'm so surprised that Jon,

22:09.648 --> 22:11.716
like, burned his meat to the
bottom of the pressure cooker.

22:11.750 --> 22:14.452
Like, I can smell it.
I can see him in the back,

22:14.486 --> 22:16.087
you know, trying
to scrub it out.

22:16.121 --> 22:19.857
Jon's starting to crumble
under pressure.

22:19.891 --> 22:23.694
I pull the legs out.
The legs aren't that bad.

22:23.729 --> 22:24.929
They haven't picked up
the burnt taste yet.

22:24.963 --> 22:27.465
I wipe this thing out,
and I'm like, ".

22:27.499 --> 22:29.033
There's still burnt
on the bottom of this.

22:29.067 --> 22:30.301
Well, I'm .

22:30.335 --> 22:31.802
I gotta do something,

22:31.837 --> 22:33.804
'cause if I put the stuff
back in here and finish it,

22:33.839 --> 22:37.875
it's all gonna taste burnt.

22:37.909 --> 22:40.745
Jon, I'll get you another one.

22:40.779 --> 22:45.983
Thank God there's another
pressure cooker in the kitchen.

22:46.018 --> 22:48.252
Thank you.

22:50.088 --> 22:51.288
Last five minutes, guys.

22:51.323 --> 22:52.590
<i>Yes, chef.
Make it count.</i>

22:52.624 --> 22:55.226
I just have to go 100%.

22:55.260 --> 22:57.762
If it means making, like,
my own fresh pasta today

22:57.796 --> 22:59.664
for this dish,
then I'm gonna do that.

22:59.698 --> 23:00.931
Wow, it smells amazing.

23:00.966 --> 23:02.466
I want to win this competition.

23:02.501 --> 23:04.168
<i>Two minutes to go.
Come on.</i>

23:04.202 --> 23:06.003
<i>Yes, chef.
Start plating.</i>

23:06.038 --> 23:09.507
My dish comes out exactly
the way that I want it to.

23:09.541 --> 23:12.209
My only concern is
I'm not sure who the judges

23:12.244 --> 23:13.644
are gonna be.

23:13.679 --> 23:15.613
And, you know,
the goat's a little spicy.

23:15.647 --> 23:17.181
Last minute. Come on.

23:17.215 --> 23:18.382
Yes, chef.

23:18.417 --> 23:20.985
Damn, my pork has not rested
long enough.

23:21.019 --> 23:22.653
I don't know what to do.
Slice it, leave a hunk.

23:22.688 --> 23:25.890
Slice it, leave a hunk.

23:25.924 --> 23:27.091
20 seconds to go.

23:27.125 --> 23:28.826
I feel like the flavors
and the ingredients

23:28.860 --> 23:29.860
that I've put into this dish

23:29.895 --> 23:32.163
are really going
to work well together.

23:32.197 --> 23:33.698
I am definitely feeling proud.

23:33.732 --> 23:39.003
<i>Five, four, three, two, one.</i>

23:39.037 --> 23:43.607
And serve.
Well done. Nice.

23:43.642 --> 23:44.975
<i>Good.</i>

23:45.010 --> 23:47.411
Domes on top
of your dishes carefully.

23:49.481 --> 23:52.450
Right, joining me today
to judge this challenge

23:52.484 --> 23:53.818
are two very prominent

23:53.852 --> 23:55.286
and incredibly successful women

23:55.320 --> 23:56.287
<i>in the food industry.</i>

23:56.321 --> 23:57.388
<i>Our first judge</i>

23:57.422 --> 24:00.991
is the James Beard
award-winning owner

24:01.026 --> 24:03.294
of one of the hottest
restaurants in Los Angeles,

24:03.328 --> 24:07.064
Osteria Mozza.
Wow.

24:07.099 --> 24:08.999
Please welcome
chef Nancy Silverton.

24:10.969 --> 24:13.037
Chef Nancy is amazing.

24:13.071 --> 24:14.138
Where I worked before,

24:14.172 --> 24:15.706
her books were always
on the shelf.

24:15.741 --> 24:17.541
Like, this is really awesome

24:17.576 --> 24:19.310
that she gets to try
my food today.

24:19.344 --> 24:21.445
Right, our next judge
is the first person ever

24:21.480 --> 24:23.614
<i>to become the recipient
of the James Beard award</i>

24:23.648 --> 24:25.015
in the field
of culinary journalism.

24:25.050 --> 24:28.152
She's currently the dine editor

24:28.186 --> 24:32.456
<i>of Los Angeles Magazine...
Lesley Bargar Suter.</i>

24:32.491 --> 24:34.258
Wow.

24:34.292 --> 24:35.459
<i>Hello.
Good morning.</i>

24:35.494 --> 24:36.594
<i>How are you, my darling?
Lovely.</i>

24:36.628 --> 24:39.330
These ladies know everything
there is to know

24:39.364 --> 24:40.998
about culinary and food.

24:41.032 --> 24:42.833
We can't have any sort
of amateur moves.

24:42.868 --> 24:44.301
Not in front of these ladies,

24:44.336 --> 24:45.903
and not
with these black jackets on.

24:45.937 --> 24:48.639
The esteemed judges and I
will be rating

24:48.673 --> 24:51.942
your dishes on a scale
of one to five stars.

24:51.977 --> 24:53.544
Clear?
Yes, chef.

24:53.578 --> 24:54.678
The chef that earns

24:54.713 --> 24:56.614
<i>the highest total amount
of stars</i>

24:56.648 --> 24:57.915
will win the challenge.

24:57.949 --> 24:59.583
Okay, ladies, ready?

24:59.618 --> 25:00.885
Ready.
I think so.

25:00.919 --> 25:02.419
Let's start off with Susan.

25:02.454 --> 25:03.854
<i>Please bring your dish forward, thank you.
Yes, chef.</i>

25:03.889 --> 25:05.623
Now that I'm wearing
a black jacket,

25:05.657 --> 25:06.957
I especially want to win.

25:06.992 --> 25:08.659
I still have some doubters
and naysayers

25:08.693 --> 25:12.196
in Hell's Kitchen, so I want
to keep proving myself.

25:12.230 --> 25:14.932
The dish I've prepared
for you today

25:14.966 --> 25:17.201
is a pork belly.

25:17.235 --> 25:19.069
And then we have
a fennel and leek slaw

25:19.104 --> 25:21.438
with some crispy
pork belly skin on top.

25:21.473 --> 25:24.041
Enjoy.

25:25.510 --> 25:27.311
<i>It eats well, but...</i>

25:27.345 --> 25:29.814
you don't feel like that fat
was really rendered.

25:29.848 --> 25:31.081
It's a little overwhelming.

25:31.116 --> 25:33.450
I told you that it's not
gonna work out for you

25:33.485 --> 25:35.452
if you open the lid.

25:41.726 --> 25:43.360
I like the flavor and the
tanginess of the slaw, though.

25:43.395 --> 25:44.829
I really think that's a nice,
brightening element.

25:44.863 --> 25:46.831
But I think it could be shaved
a little thinner.

25:46.865 --> 25:49.500
It's a little clunky.

25:49.534 --> 25:51.802
The pork is undercooked on top

25:51.837 --> 25:53.237
and cooked beautifully
underneath.

25:53.271 --> 25:55.105
Um, ladies, please,
reach for your scores.

25:55.140 --> 25:57.074
I'm gonna give it a three star.

25:57.108 --> 26:00.077
I will do the same.

26:00.111 --> 26:01.512
Three stars.

26:01.546 --> 26:02.980
Thank you.
Good job.

26:03.014 --> 26:03.981
<i>Nine.
Thank you.</i>

26:04.015 --> 26:05.349
Susan only gets nine stars.

26:05.383 --> 26:08.152
Next up, Jon.
Let's go, please, thank you.

26:08.186 --> 26:09.854
They're really tough critics,
and we've got our work

26:09.888 --> 26:11.956
cut out for us today.

26:11.990 --> 26:13.257
Ah, lovely.

26:13.291 --> 26:15.192
<i>Wow.
This is a lamb leg.</i>

26:15.227 --> 26:17.528
I kind of went
more traditional, like French.

26:17.562 --> 26:20.197
You have rutabaga,
some fingerling potatoes.

26:20.232 --> 26:22.266
Classic rustic dish.

26:22.300 --> 26:23.734
Visually,
the color's fantastic.

26:23.768 --> 26:25.536
This is
beautiful caramelization.

26:25.570 --> 26:28.005
Let's hope it tastes
as good as it looks.

26:29.574 --> 26:31.909
<i>I think
that you would have benefited</i>

26:31.943 --> 26:34.011
for more time
in the pressure cooker

26:34.045 --> 26:35.246
'cause it's still
a little bit tough.

26:35.280 --> 26:38.015
!
I knew that too.

26:38.049 --> 26:39.516
A little too much butter
for me.

26:39.551 --> 26:42.386
So you know, once
I feel it on my lips,

26:42.420 --> 26:44.788
<i>I know that...
It's a lifetime on the hips.</i>

26:44.823 --> 26:46.857
<i>Yeah.</i>

26:46.892 --> 26:48.158
You know, the flavor
is definitely there.

26:48.193 --> 26:49.593
<i>Thank you.
But I do agree that</i>

26:49.628 --> 26:50.628
it could have done
with a little more time.

26:50.662 --> 26:52.496
Presentation-wise,
it was great.

26:52.530 --> 26:53.597
Meat's not cooked enough.

26:53.632 --> 26:54.965
<i>But a good effort.
Yep.</i>

26:55.000 --> 26:57.101
Ladies.

26:57.135 --> 26:58.736
Wow.

26:58.770 --> 27:00.638
Three, three, four.

27:00.672 --> 27:01.639
<i>There you go.
Thank you, chef.</i>

27:01.673 --> 27:03.240
Good job.
Thank you.

27:03.275 --> 27:05.342
I really wanted to just
blow them away,

27:05.377 --> 27:06.810
but at this moment,
I'm winning, man.

27:06.845 --> 27:08.612
I'm like, all right, cool.
I'll take that right now.

27:08.647 --> 27:10.014
I can win this challenge.

27:10.048 --> 27:11.148
Cyndi, let's go,
please, darling.

27:11.182 --> 27:12.416
This is it.

27:12.450 --> 27:14.585
This is where the individuals
start coming out.

27:14.619 --> 27:16.153
I really need to win
one of these

27:16.187 --> 27:17.388
and have the best dish.

27:17.422 --> 27:20.124
I had the pork roast.

27:20.158 --> 27:21.258
And on the bottom
of the plate is

27:21.293 --> 27:23.060
an acorn squash puree.

27:23.094 --> 27:24.762
<i>And then a fig compote.</i>

27:24.796 --> 27:27.498
Thank you, Cyndi.
You're welcome.

27:30.835 --> 27:32.903
A lot of flavors in there.
They all work.

27:32.938 --> 27:36.206
But a little bit put off
by the color of the pork.

27:38.777 --> 27:39.877
Visually, it's just not
very appealing,

27:39.911 --> 27:42.813
but it does taste nice.

27:44.482 --> 27:47.217
Such a shame because
potentially a great dish there.

27:47.252 --> 27:48.686
Unfortunately, the presentation
lets it down because it looks

27:48.720 --> 27:50.254
like it's been carved,
you know, five hours ago.

27:50.288 --> 27:51.255
Ladies...

27:51.289 --> 27:52.623
Let's do it together.

27:52.657 --> 27:55.826
Three, two, two.
Wow.

27:55.860 --> 27:57.294
Seven.

27:57.329 --> 27:58.395
Oh, my God.

27:58.430 --> 28:00.931
I can't believe I got 7

28:00.966 --> 28:02.433
out of 15.

28:02.467 --> 28:04.368
Oh, my God, it's not even half.

28:04.402 --> 28:05.769
kidding me.

28:05.804 --> 28:07.271
Susan got a nine!

28:07.305 --> 28:10.341
Next up, Ja'nel, please.
Let's go.

28:10.375 --> 28:11.875
Jon has the
lead with ten stars,

28:11.910 --> 28:14.244
but the door clearly
remains open

28:14.279 --> 28:16.714
for Ja'nel and her goat
to grab the lead.

28:16.748 --> 28:18.482
Today I had the goat ribs.

28:18.516 --> 28:20.050
<i>I did a little crispy okra</i>

28:20.085 --> 28:22.419
<i>with a rustic smashed
sweet potato.</i>

28:22.454 --> 28:24.321
<i>Great. Thanks.
Please enjoy.</i>

28:29.494 --> 28:30.794
It's better than great.

28:30.829 --> 28:33.230
<i>That's great.
No, better than great.</i>

28:35.734 --> 28:37.067
Very well-seasoned.
It's really good.

28:37.102 --> 28:41.171
You know, goat's actually
one of my favorite proteins.

28:41.206 --> 28:43.407
Wow, that, for me,
is phenomenal.

28:43.441 --> 28:45.542
Ladies?

28:46.745 --> 28:47.878
<i>Wow.</i>

28:47.912 --> 28:49.780
Good job, Ja'nel.

28:49.814 --> 28:51.215
Five, four, five.
Great job, Ja'nel.

28:51.249 --> 28:52.649
Thank you, chef.

28:52.684 --> 28:54.051
Yes! 14 out of 15.

28:54.085 --> 28:57.087
Good luck, Mary,
you're gonna need it.

28:57.122 --> 28:58.355
Amazing, and you're in the lead.
Really good job.

28:58.390 --> 28:59.590
Good job.
Thank you, chef.

28:59.624 --> 29:01.692
Last but not least,
our butcher Mary.

29:01.726 --> 29:03.360
<i>Let's go.</i>

29:03.395 --> 29:05.529
With Ja'nel
taking an impressive lead

29:05.563 --> 29:07.598
with a near-perfect score,

29:07.632 --> 29:09.566
the pressure now shifts
to Mary

29:09.601 --> 29:11.335
and her beef bourguignon.

29:11.369 --> 29:13.103
So today I made for you
boeuf bourguignon.

29:13.138 --> 29:14.171
<i>So I seared off the meat,</i>

29:14.205 --> 29:15.672
I left it on the bone
while it was cooking,

29:15.707 --> 29:18.375
and I made fresh pasta
to go with it as well.

29:18.410 --> 29:20.377
You made fresh pasta?
Yeah, I did. Yeah.

29:20.412 --> 29:21.645
<i>Wow, thank you.
That's ambitious.</i>

29:21.679 --> 29:23.914
Thank you.
That's brave. Let me tell you.

29:23.948 --> 29:26.917
I have faith in my dish.
I love it.

29:26.951 --> 29:29.953
But 14 out of 15 is gonna be
really hard to beat.

29:29.988 --> 29:32.723
Nancy, how was that?

29:32.757 --> 29:35.225
<i>Everything complements
the chunks of the meat,</i>

29:35.260 --> 29:36.794
the chunks of the carrot.
Even the noodle.

29:36.828 --> 29:39.029
Oh, good.

29:39.064 --> 29:40.264
Yeah, I'm loving...
I'm loving the meat.

29:40.298 --> 29:43.801
It's delicious.
Really delicious. Very good.

29:43.835 --> 29:45.903
The question is, ladies,
does it beat Ja'nel?

29:45.937 --> 29:48.872
I'm getting a little worried,

29:48.907 --> 29:51.542
but I definitely think that
my dish was better than Mary's.

29:51.576 --> 29:53.177
<i>I mean, it's mine.
Everything complements.</i>

29:53.211 --> 29:55.712
And the mushrooms are
cooked perfectly. Yeah.

29:55.747 --> 29:58.048
<i>It's a great dish.</i>

29:58.083 --> 30:00.551
This is torture.
I just want to know.

30:00.585 --> 30:02.453
Man, I want to win so bad.

30:02.487 --> 30:03.454
Are you ready for your scores?

30:03.488 --> 30:05.489
I'm ready.

30:07.000 --> 30:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

30:16.274 --> 30:17.941
Mary is the
last to present her dish

30:17.976 --> 30:19.643
in the pressure cooker
challenge,

30:19.678 --> 30:22.112
and she will need
a perfect score of 15 stars

30:22.147 --> 30:25.549
to claim victory
over Ja'nel's 14-star goat ribs.

30:25.583 --> 30:27.184
It's a great dish.
Thank you, chef.

30:27.218 --> 30:30.821
The question is, ladies,
does it beat Ja'nel?

30:30.855 --> 30:33.891
Are you ready for your scores?
I'm ready.

30:33.925 --> 30:36.327
Please.

30:38.029 --> 30:40.597
Oh, my God!
Thank you so much.

30:40.632 --> 30:41.598
Wow.
Thank you very much.

30:41.633 --> 30:42.599
<i>Three fives.</i>

30:42.634 --> 30:43.701
Wow, Mary, you produced

30:43.735 --> 30:45.602
a five-star dish
beyond belief.

30:45.637 --> 30:48.539
I am so excited.
I get to see my family today.

30:48.573 --> 30:50.808
Like, this is
the best day ever.

30:50.842 --> 30:52.042
Good job, Mary.
Good job, Mary.

30:52.077 --> 30:53.243
Good job, Mary.

30:53.278 --> 30:55.012
Will you join me in thanking

30:55.046 --> 30:56.947
<i>these two amazing judges?
Thank you.</i>

30:56.981 --> 31:00.284
Thank you so much.
Thank you. Thank you.

31:00.318 --> 31:02.853
Uh, Mary, here's the good news.

31:02.887 --> 31:04.822
You are in for one hell of
a treat today, let me tell you.

31:04.856 --> 31:07.558
You will have the most
amazing meal with your family

31:07.592 --> 31:10.527
at Wolfgang Puck's WP24.

31:10.562 --> 31:12.863
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, wow.

31:12.897 --> 31:13.964
That sucks.

31:13.998 --> 31:15.265
Way to go.

31:15.300 --> 31:16.800
I definitely want
to see my family,

31:16.835 --> 31:20.304
and I'm so horrendously
disappointed in myself.

31:20.338 --> 31:23.040
That whole restaurant
is entirely reserved

31:23.074 --> 31:24.208
for you and your family.

31:24.242 --> 31:26.043
Thank you so much.

31:26.077 --> 31:28.545
Hurry up, because your limo
is on its way.

31:28.580 --> 31:29.580
Good job, Mary. Good job.
Good job, guys.

31:29.614 --> 31:32.082
Good job, Mary.
Thank you, thank you.

31:32.117 --> 31:33.283
I am so excited.

31:33.318 --> 31:35.018
This is
the experience of a lifetime

31:35.053 --> 31:36.820
that I get to share
with my family.

31:36.855 --> 31:40.224
I'm soaring so high right now.

31:40.258 --> 31:42.226
While Mary is dining
with her family,

31:42.260 --> 31:44.928
<i>you are in for some agonizing,</i>

31:44.963 --> 31:48.132
exhausting,
and some very dirty work.

31:48.166 --> 31:49.933
Just give it to us, man,
'cause I already know

31:49.968 --> 31:51.068
it's gonna be wicked.

31:51.102 --> 31:53.270
Just...

31:53.304 --> 31:55.906
I volunteered
all four of your services

31:55.940 --> 31:57.307
<i>as the maintenance crew</i>

31:57.342 --> 31:59.877
for tree people.

31:59.911 --> 32:02.079
You'll be digging in hillsides,

32:02.113 --> 32:04.581
slashing brush,
shoveling mulch,

32:04.616 --> 32:06.049
and giving back
to the community, right?

32:06.084 --> 32:07.885
Yes, chef.

32:07.919 --> 32:09.853
That's not all.
Ugh.

32:09.888 --> 32:13.390
Today's a big day
because it is recycling day.

32:15.326 --> 32:17.995
<i>So you'll all be jumping
into the dumpsters,</i>

32:18.029 --> 32:19.530
<i>pulling out all the garbage,</i>

32:19.564 --> 32:22.533
separating the food trash
from those bottles...

32:22.567 --> 32:24.802
Putting them in their
proper bins, please.

32:24.836 --> 32:26.170
<i>Get out of here.</i>

32:26.204 --> 32:29.173
This punishment sounds
absolutely disgusting.

32:29.207 --> 32:30.841
I've got
a really strong stomach,

32:30.875 --> 32:33.610
but not so much
when it comes to smells.

32:33.645 --> 32:35.712
I'm swimmin' in this thing.

32:35.747 --> 32:37.247
Me too.

32:37.282 --> 32:38.248
<i>Look at this.</i>

32:38.283 --> 32:39.550
I don't think anyone else

32:39.584 --> 32:41.618
feels as good
about the jumpsuit as I do.

32:41.653 --> 32:44.221
Cyndi's jumpsuit is just huge.

32:44.255 --> 32:45.589
The crotch is down
to her knees.

32:45.623 --> 32:48.091
Jon's jumpsuit is big...

32:49.327 --> 32:51.762
And, like, he looks
like a crazy person.

32:51.796 --> 32:54.298
And Ja'nel's...
I'm like am Oompa Loompa.

32:54.332 --> 32:58.235
Her jumpsuit just isn't
as flattering as mine is.

32:58.269 --> 32:59.736
I'm gonna rock this jumpsuit.

32:59.771 --> 33:01.772
While Susan
attempts to bring high fashion

33:01.806 --> 33:04.174
to a lowly punishment, Mary...

33:04.209 --> 33:06.176
Oh, my goodness!

33:06.211 --> 33:08.946
Is anxious for some
family time high above Los Angeles.

33:08.980 --> 33:10.247
<i>Hey...</i>

33:10.281 --> 33:11.615
Honey!

33:11.649 --> 33:14.318
This is the best reward
I could have ever asked for.

33:14.352 --> 33:18.222
Aw.

33:18.256 --> 33:19.423
This is really exciting.

33:19.457 --> 33:21.859
It's been over a year

33:21.893 --> 33:23.827
since I've seen my brother.

33:23.862 --> 33:26.163
To be able to share
something great

33:26.197 --> 33:28.332
with the people
that I love is...

33:28.366 --> 33:29.867
is the best.

33:29.901 --> 33:31.768
I had to win
the challenge today.

33:31.803 --> 33:33.370
I was like, I can't lose.
I have to win.

33:33.404 --> 33:35.072
<i>And you did.
I have to see my family.</i>

33:35.106 --> 33:36.673
We should make a toast.

33:36.708 --> 33:38.108
To family.

33:38.142 --> 33:39.710
To supporting
each other's dreams.

33:39.744 --> 33:41.044
Yeah.

33:41.079 --> 33:44.381
And to getting to spend the
day together, whoo-hoo!

33:44.415 --> 33:46.950
While Mary
reconnects with her family...

33:46.985 --> 33:49.286
<i>That is delicious.
Mmm.</i>

33:49.320 --> 33:50.787
So good.
It's delicious.

33:50.822 --> 33:53.690
The rest of the
team is about to reconnect

33:53.725 --> 33:54.791
with mother nature.

33:54.826 --> 33:56.126
<i>Hello.
Hi.</i>

33:56.160 --> 33:57.794
Welcome to tree people.

33:57.829 --> 34:00.030
I'm Jim Hardie,
director of operations here

34:00.064 --> 34:01.965
in Coldwater Canyon Park,
home of tree people.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.834
All right, the first task
for two of you

34:03.868 --> 34:05.602
is gonna be moving that mulch
over there

34:05.637 --> 34:06.970
and recovering a trail.

34:07.005 --> 34:08.371
All right, who's gonna do this?

34:08.406 --> 34:11.007
Mulching seems easy enough,

34:11.042 --> 34:14.478
but maybe there's something
a little easier.

34:14.512 --> 34:16.346
Go to it. Now.

34:16.380 --> 34:18.549
Giving back to the earth,
it's a great idea,

34:18.583 --> 34:20.817
as far as a punishment,
so I'm, you know,

34:20.851 --> 34:22.286
totally ready to do
a little bit of volunteer work

34:22.320 --> 34:23.353
while I'm here.

34:23.388 --> 34:25.389
You two are gonna
help us clean out

34:25.422 --> 34:26.857
an eroded hillside, all right?

34:26.891 --> 34:28.859
We're gonna move soil,
take it out on the trail,

34:28.893 --> 34:30.226
flatten it down.

34:30.261 --> 34:33.196
We're going to be digging up
the side of a hill.

34:33.231 --> 34:36.766
So I'm kind of wishing I was
moving the mulch right now.

34:36.801 --> 34:39.101
There's the good mulch.

34:39.137 --> 34:40.670
See how nice and moist it is?
Getting moist in there.

34:40.705 --> 34:42.472
Me and Ja'nel are actually
working pretty good as a team.

34:42.507 --> 34:43.907
Ready?

34:43.942 --> 34:46.043
We're getting big ol' sections
done pretty fast.

34:46.077 --> 34:47.043
Pitchfork the mulch,

34:47.078 --> 34:49.813
go down to the path,
put it down,

34:49.847 --> 34:52.649
spread it around...
kick it, rake it, whatever.

34:52.684 --> 34:54.117
So far, so good.

34:54.152 --> 34:55.418
We'll just keep
this little system going,

34:55.453 --> 34:59.323
and we'll be done in no time.

34:59.357 --> 35:00.991
Are you okay?

35:01.025 --> 35:03.226
Yep.

35:03.261 --> 35:05.729
This is manual, manual labor.

35:05.763 --> 35:07.931
My back is starting
to get sore,

35:07.966 --> 35:10.734
my hands are getting raw
a little bit, it's bad.

35:10.768 --> 35:13.804
This is heavy.
I know.

35:13.838 --> 35:14.938
This thing weighs,
like, 100 pounds.

35:14.973 --> 35:19.376
Ugh, my back.

35:19.410 --> 35:22.779
While Susan longs for
a little back support, Mary...

35:22.814 --> 35:26.283
Here's our kobe short rib chow fun.
Wow!

35:26.317 --> 35:28.285
Celebrates with
her biggest supporters.

35:28.319 --> 35:30.187
Hold it with your index
and your thumb.

35:30.221 --> 35:32.189
Like that.
Yeah.

35:32.223 --> 35:35.025
This is going to be
quite the task.

35:37.295 --> 35:39.896
I always call us the
velveeta and wonder bread family.

35:39.931 --> 35:41.498
Like, we weren't
fine dining people.

35:41.532 --> 35:42.499
This is good.

35:42.533 --> 35:44.067
I don't know how much is

35:44.102 --> 35:45.936
going into their mouths,

35:45.970 --> 35:48.805
but this food is so good.

35:48.840 --> 35:50.741
<i>To the good life!
To the good life!</i>

35:50.775 --> 35:54.645
Exactly, right?

35:54.679 --> 35:56.513
I'm giving you guys
a passing grade.

35:56.547 --> 35:58.281
<i>Let's see how they're
doing down here.</i>

35:58.316 --> 35:59.349
What's the problem?

35:59.384 --> 36:00.550
Some big thing
just started crawling

36:00.585 --> 36:03.186
out of the earth.

36:03.221 --> 36:04.888
It looked like
a creature.

36:04.922 --> 36:06.323
A what creature?

36:06.357 --> 36:08.725
<i>It was just like...
It was creepy-looking.</i>

36:08.760 --> 36:11.795
<i>Ew.
No, leave it buried.</i>

36:11.829 --> 36:13.397
<i>It was nasty.</i>

36:13.431 --> 36:15.165
<i>It wasn't,
like, an insect?</i>

36:15.199 --> 36:17.401
<i>No, it was big.
And it was getting bigger.</i>

36:17.435 --> 36:20.270
But you're okay?
Take a breath, breathe deeply.

36:20.304 --> 36:24.374
All right.
Well, you got some of it done.

36:24.409 --> 36:27.210
All right.
That's it for today.

36:27.245 --> 36:28.311
Thanks a lot.
Thank you, Jim.

36:28.346 --> 36:31.415
Oh, my God, I am so glad
this one is over.

36:31.449 --> 36:35.452
But I am nervous for, you know,

36:35.486 --> 36:37.020
what's waiting in store for us

36:37.055 --> 36:38.155
back at Hell's Kitchen.

36:38.189 --> 36:40.424
I know there is more to come.

36:40.458 --> 36:43.560
I gotta do my part, so I'm just
gonna do it with a smile.

36:43.594 --> 36:45.295
Vegetables are edible,

36:45.329 --> 36:47.130
<i>or used to be
at one time edible.</i>

36:47.165 --> 36:48.298
<i>Put 'em in the organic,
and everything else goes</i>

36:48.332 --> 36:50.067
<i>in the non-organic, okay?
Thank you, chef.</i>

36:50.101 --> 36:51.101
Thank you, chef.
Really appreciate it.

36:51.135 --> 36:52.936
Back to manual labor for me.

36:52.970 --> 36:54.638
Whatever, man, I'm used to it.

36:54.672 --> 36:56.273
Let's just...
let's go and do this .

36:56.307 --> 36:59.276
Oh, my God, I am gonna vomit.

36:59.310 --> 37:00.444
Yeah, that's disgusting.

37:02.180 --> 37:04.381
Just think
of the most disgusting thing

37:04.415 --> 37:05.582
that you've ever smelled,

37:05.616 --> 37:07.751
and then multiply that
by 572,000.

37:07.785 --> 37:09.553
That's how bad it is.

37:09.587 --> 37:12.856
God, it smells horrible.
Like .

37:12.890 --> 37:15.125
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah!

37:15.159 --> 37:16.927
<i>Uh, I don't like
the sound of that, Jon.</i>

37:16.961 --> 37:21.231
When did we start eating
so much rice?

37:21.265 --> 37:22.999
Aah, there's maggots!

37:23.034 --> 37:25.736
Maggots, it's really
the most disgusting thing

37:25.770 --> 37:27.471
I could ever think of.

37:27.505 --> 37:28.939
<i>It's moving and wiggling.</i>

37:28.973 --> 37:30.707
Do you see that? It's wiggling.
Yep, that's maggots.

37:30.742 --> 37:33.009
Come on, ladies, just
get through this punishment

37:33.044 --> 37:36.580
and get
these damn coveralls off.

37:36.614 --> 37:38.248
Oh, God, there's maggots
all in this meat.

37:38.282 --> 37:39.816
I can't do it!

37:39.851 --> 37:41.685
It's just disgusting
and filthy.

37:41.719 --> 37:42.753
It's giving me the willies.

37:42.787 --> 37:44.020
<i>Don't get too close.</i>

37:44.055 --> 37:46.022
Oh, my God, I can't do it.

37:46.057 --> 37:48.959
<i>Look at that little maggot.
He's trying to get away.</i>

37:48.993 --> 37:50.660
<i>, there's maggots!</i>

37:57.615 --> 37:58.881
After claiming victory

37:58.916 --> 38:01.217
in the pressure cooker
challenge with a perfect score,

38:01.251 --> 38:04.387
Mary enjoys a rewarding
afternoon with her family.

38:04.421 --> 38:07.590
To getting to spend the day
together, whoo-hoo!

38:07.625 --> 38:09.792
Meanwhile,
back at Hell's Kitchen...

38:09.827 --> 38:12.161
When did we start eating
so much rice?

38:12.196 --> 38:13.863
Aah, there's maggots!

38:13.897 --> 38:15.965
Ja'nel can't
stomach another moment

38:16.000 --> 38:17.166
of dumpster diving.

38:17.201 --> 38:18.735
It's moving and wiggling.

38:18.769 --> 38:20.236
Do you see that? It's wiggling.
Yep, that's maggots.

38:20.270 --> 38:22.171
I really would be just fine

38:22.206 --> 38:24.307
rifling through
this filth and grime

38:24.341 --> 38:26.242
if it weren't for the maggots.

38:26.276 --> 38:28.645
<i>Is this the maggot bag?
They all are.</i>

38:28.679 --> 38:29.879
I think they're all
maggot bags.

38:31.448 --> 38:34.584
Come on, Ja'nel.
Shut up, there's maggots!

38:34.618 --> 38:35.718
Aah!

38:35.753 --> 38:36.819
The faster we can get done,

38:36.854 --> 38:39.022
this torture
will be behind us,

38:39.056 --> 38:40.490
and we can move forward.

38:40.524 --> 38:42.125
Look, it's Nedra's head thing.

38:42.159 --> 38:45.194
<i>Oh, wow.
Really?</i>

38:45.229 --> 38:46.863
Wow, that's from,
like, the beginning.

38:46.897 --> 38:48.097
<i>That's probably
non-organic</i>

38:48.132 --> 38:49.399
<i>just 'cause it's flammable.</i>

38:49.433 --> 38:50.933
Oh, wow.

38:50.968 --> 38:52.101
<i>This is, like,
disgusto!</i>

38:52.136 --> 38:54.103
<i>Oh, , here comes Mary.</i>

38:54.138 --> 38:55.471
Hi, guys.

38:55.506 --> 38:57.674
Hey, Mary.
Hey, what's up, Mary?

38:57.708 --> 38:59.676
<i>How's it going?
Awesome.</i>

38:59.710 --> 39:01.978
I am so glad that
I'm not out there today.

39:02.012 --> 39:03.980
They do not look happy
right now.

39:04.014 --> 39:05.181
You want to come help?

39:05.215 --> 39:07.150
Um, I'm sorry,
I can't right now.

39:07.184 --> 39:08.584
Are you sure?

39:08.619 --> 39:10.186
I have to wash my hair.

39:10.220 --> 39:12.455
I never want
to go dumpster diving.

39:12.489 --> 39:14.557
I'm sure I'm not
missing anything.

39:14.591 --> 39:15.725
Bye.

39:15.759 --> 39:18.661
That is definitely not
on my list of goals.

39:18.696 --> 39:20.797
Oh!
Careful.

39:21.932 --> 39:24.333
I looked really cute
in the beginning,

39:24.368 --> 39:26.502
but now, not so much.

39:26.537 --> 39:29.238
Trash is not a good look
for any girl.

39:31.075 --> 39:33.643
Son of a biscuit!

39:33.677 --> 39:36.179
I need some R&R
like nobody's business.

39:36.213 --> 39:38.514
All right, let's go.
Thank God!

39:38.549 --> 39:39.515
Let's get the
out of here.

39:39.550 --> 39:40.550
Head up to the dorms.

39:40.584 --> 39:41.784
I'm gonna shower.

39:41.819 --> 39:44.721
Eat , you hippie
recycling bastards.

39:44.755 --> 39:47.957
My turn.
Pretty putrid.

39:49.293 --> 39:51.761
After a long, sweaty,

39:51.795 --> 39:53.096
smelly day,

39:53.130 --> 39:54.731
the losers have
cleaned up their act,

39:54.765 --> 39:57.233
and all the chefs are ready
to call it a night...

39:57.267 --> 40:00.136
<i>I feel like a new woman.
I know. Seriously.</i>

40:00.170 --> 40:02.071
Except for one.

40:02.106 --> 40:04.340
Don't even know if I can eat
for the next three days.

40:04.374 --> 40:07.944
Hello?

40:07.978 --> 40:09.812
It's chef Ramsay.
I need everybody downstairs

40:09.847 --> 40:11.280
<i>immediately, please.
Okay. Yes, chef.</i>

40:11.315 --> 40:12.815
Quick as you can.
Let's go.

40:12.850 --> 40:14.650
Susan,
downstairs immediately!

40:14.685 --> 40:16.886
I totally thought we were
just in for the night

40:16.920 --> 40:19.555
after this long day
of punishment.

40:19.590 --> 40:21.290
<i>Where's Susan?
I'm coming.</i>

40:21.325 --> 40:24.794
I had no idea that we were
gonna be going back downstairs.

40:24.828 --> 40:27.063
Hurry up.
Line up, please.

40:27.097 --> 40:29.298
Uh, girls, I can see
you got down here fast.

40:29.333 --> 40:30.800
, Susan, you all right?

40:30.834 --> 40:33.202
I just got out of the shower.

40:33.237 --> 40:36.405
I feel so silly and embarrassed

40:36.440 --> 40:38.674
standing here
with this towel on my head.

40:38.709 --> 40:41.410
But at least it's evidence
that I've washed myself.

40:41.445 --> 40:42.578
Um, the reason
why I got you all down here,

40:42.613 --> 40:43.980
very quickly, is because

40:44.014 --> 40:47.483
I've got to tell you something
very, very important.

40:47.518 --> 40:49.786
Oh, . Like, what kind
of curve ball is he throwing?

40:49.820 --> 40:51.087
Tomorrow night's dinner service

40:51.121 --> 40:53.055
will be the most challenging
dinner service

40:53.090 --> 40:54.891
you've ever had
in Hell's Kitchen.

40:54.925 --> 40:58.261
And it also may be
the most challenging

40:58.295 --> 41:01.464
you've ever had
in your culinary career.

41:01.498 --> 41:03.099
Firstly, you're gonna be
working together

41:03.133 --> 41:05.568
as one dynamic team
in one kitchen.

41:05.602 --> 41:07.236
How does that sound?
Great, chef.

41:07.271 --> 41:08.471
Sounds great, chef.
Absolutely.

41:08.505 --> 41:11.207
But there will be
another team of chefs

41:11.241 --> 41:14.510
in the other kitchen.

41:14.545 --> 41:17.647
You'll be up
against some of the finest chefs

41:17.681 --> 41:20.082
<i>i've ever known.
Wow.</i>

41:20.117 --> 41:22.952
I need to know how good
each and every one of you are

41:22.986 --> 41:25.988
when you're up
against serious competition.

41:26.023 --> 41:29.091
Holy shmokes, we've met
so many amazing chefs.

41:29.126 --> 41:30.593
Like, it could be anybody.

41:30.627 --> 41:32.328
Is it chef Nobu?
You know, is it Wolfgang Puck?

41:32.362 --> 41:34.197
Who could it possibly be?

41:34.231 --> 41:36.666
Right now,
I really need to know

41:36.700 --> 41:38.568
<i>how good you really are.</i>

41:38.602 --> 41:40.670
Up for the challenge?
Yes, chef.

41:40.704 --> 41:42.972
Excited?
Yes, chef.

41:43.006 --> 41:44.540
Would you like to meet
your competition?

41:44.575 --> 41:46.342
Yes, chef.

41:46.376 --> 41:47.910
Are you kidding me?

41:47.945 --> 41:49.579
Complete strangers
that I'm gonna compete against?

41:49.613 --> 41:51.647
They're gonna take me seriously
with a towel on my head?

41:51.682 --> 41:52.982
I mean, come on.
Really?

41:53.016 --> 41:55.351
Okay, listen carefully.

41:55.385 --> 41:57.854
Our first chef...

41:57.888 --> 42:00.423
Please welcome...

42:00.457 --> 42:02.558
Wow.

42:06.129 --> 42:07.897
<i>Next time on Hell's Kitchen...</i>

42:07.931 --> 42:09.966
When I told you the competition
was gonna be strong,

42:10.000 --> 42:11.067
I really meant it.

42:11.101 --> 42:12.468
See which well-known chefs

42:12.502 --> 42:14.337
will walk through the doors
of Hell's Kitchen...

42:14.371 --> 42:16.472
That man is an absolute beast
in the kitchen.

42:16.506 --> 42:18.741
To face off
against the final five.

42:18.775 --> 42:20.209
I think we're all feeling
the pressure.

42:20.244 --> 42:21.744
Will the chefs stand a chance...

42:21.778 --> 42:23.045
Let's do this.

42:23.080 --> 42:24.447
Cooking
against this elite group?

42:24.481 --> 42:26.682
Seriously, like, they're
on another level.

42:26.717 --> 42:28.885
And will
they be forced to resort

42:28.919 --> 42:30.152
to more desperate measures?

42:30.187 --> 42:31.687
I might have to get
my cleaver out

42:31.722 --> 42:34.090
and chop his head off.
Aah!

42:34.124 --> 42:36.859
And although the chefs
are told to work more as a team...

42:36.894 --> 42:38.661
You guys need to start
trusting each other.

42:38.695 --> 42:39.662
The in-fighting...

42:39.696 --> 42:40.963
I'm not trying to be a .

42:40.998 --> 42:42.665
I don't agree with that.
You failed.

42:42.699 --> 42:44.367
What?
Forces chef Ramsay

42:44.401 --> 42:45.434
to make a decision...

42:45.469 --> 42:46.802
This is where it gets ugly.

42:46.837 --> 42:48.504
That changes
the competition forever.

42:48.538 --> 42:49.838
You leave me no choice.

42:49.873 --> 42:51.020
It is an absolute disaster.

42:51.055 --> 42:53.356
I don't trust anyone.
