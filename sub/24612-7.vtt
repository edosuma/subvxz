          that this has
       of actually working

13:54.484 --> 13:56.718
    is if he brings in Jules
      as a surprise closer,

13:56.720 --> 13:58.553
    so can we bring her out?

13:58.555 --> 14:00.888
     Jules? Hello? Help me!

14:00.890 --> 14:01.889
        Jules isn't here.

14:02.892 --> 14:05.026
         I invited her,
     told her to come down.

14:05.028 --> 14:08.096
          She said no,
   said it wasn't gonna work.

14:08.098 --> 14:09.330
            -Well --
   -Apparently she was right.

14:09.332 --> 14:10.999
                 Yeah, well,
             what'd you expect?

14:11.001 --> 14:12.600
      You brought me into a room
       full of addicts, Charles.

14:12.602 --> 14:14.102
            I mean --
       -We're not addicts.

14:14.104 --> 14:15.703
           Oh, really?

14:15.705 --> 14:17.505
   What if I told you you, uh,
    couldn't have sex again?

14:17.507 --> 14:19.173
                   Today?

14:19.175 --> 14:20.508
                 I guess --
     I guess that would be hard.

14:20.510 --> 14:21.943
         Yeah, I guess.

14:21.945 --> 14:23.344
    Look, we all have our own
    little coping mechanisms

14:23.346 --> 14:24.679
         to get through

14:24.681 --> 14:26.547
 this charnel house called life,
            alright?

14:26.549 --> 14:29.851
 Lucy has to have sex with every
  single person that she meets.

14:29.853 --> 14:31.853
    Pedro staves off oblivion

14:31.855 --> 14:34.222
        through constant
   and relentless procreation.

14:34.224 --> 14:35.890
                 <i> Oye, papi,</i>
         that's a stretch, okay?

14:35.892 --> 14:36.891
      You have 14 children.

14:36.893 --> 14:38.593
        And hopefully, 15, okay,

14:38.595 --> 14:41.062
 because Uribe has been painting
            Polly's uterine wall

14:41.064 --> 14:42.730
       with at least three coats
                a day, papi.

14:42.732 --> 14:44.799
Jim, nobody's perfect.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.734
 That's why step 10
has us continually taking --

14:46.736 --> 14:49.537
You're addicted to the 12 steps!
      You understand that?

14:49.539 --> 14:51.572
    Course I am,
 you arrogant prick.

14:51.574 --> 14:53.074
That's how they work.

14:53.076 --> 14:54.108
            [Scoffs]

14:54.110 --> 14:55.610
            Raj, hi.
              Raj.

14:55.612 --> 14:57.111
        He's so desperate

14:57.113 --> 14:59.647
 to please every, single person
          that he meets

14:59.649 --> 15:01.382
          that despite
    being a very polite man,

15:01.384 --> 15:03.451
     he just flipped me off
     at my own intervention

15:03.453 --> 15:05.653
       because he thought
  that I might find it amusing.

15:05.655 --> 15:06.988
But you did like it,
   though, right?

15:06.990 --> 15:08.389
       Yeah, it was great.

15:08.391 --> 15:10.258
   Joe Buck, if he were here,
        I would tell him

15:10.260 --> 15:12.727
 that he has to say yes to every
  single gig that he is offered

15:12.729 --> 15:14.629
   because God forbid the man
         should be alone

15:14.631 --> 15:16.330
      with his own thoughts
    for a second and a half.

15:16.332 --> 15:19.067
    But instead of attending,
   he's off proving that point

15:19.069 --> 15:23.271
 by calling women's senior golf
     for Fox Sports Online!

15:23.273 --> 15:26.574
    And Charles, God damn it,
   let's not forget how you --

15:26.576 --> 15:28.142
      Hey! Hey! Hello?! --

15:28.144 --> 15:29.677
       how you betrayed me

15:29.679 --> 15:32.914
        by leaving to do
  this podcast thing of yours.

15:32.916 --> 15:35.616
        which, you know,
        I gotta tell ya..

15:35.618 --> 15:42.623
            [Sighing]

15:42.625 --> 15:44.292
             ...is a smart play.

15:44.294 --> 15:45.793
                Good for you.
                 Seriously.

15:45.795 --> 15:47.762
      It breaks this destructive
              pattern you're in

15:47.764 --> 15:49.697
    of putting everybody's needs
           in front of your own,

15:49.699 --> 15:51.466
          especially mine, okay?

15:51.468 --> 15:53.134
                   I guess
           unlike everybody else

15:53.136 --> 15:55.436
           in this little circle
           of adult dysfunction,

15:55.438 --> 15:56.938
                  you seem
         to be actually growing,

15:56.940 --> 15:58.773
                so go ahead,
               say your thing,

15:58.775 --> 16:02.210
then, you know, we can all order
 a drink before happy hour ends.

16:02.212 --> 16:04.112
              [Inhales deeply]

16:04.114 --> 16:05.813
                   [Sighs]

16:09.519 --> 16:10.518
               Okay, come o--

16:10.520 --> 16:11.719
                    Charles?
         [Door opens]

16:11.721 --> 16:13.121
               Don't do that.
                   [Sighs]

16:13.123 --> 16:14.622
         [Door closes]
           You happy?

16:14.624 --> 16:17.024
    No, I hope you're happy.
      You mad Charles sad!

16:17.026 --> 16:18.292
             Great.

16:18.294 --> 16:20.027
           Had to have
    an intervention for Jim.

16:20.029 --> 16:22.196
          God damn it.

16:26.922 --> 16:28.489
I mean,
the best part

16:28.491 --> 16:29.924
is that I get to work
with Bob Uecker.

16:29.926 --> 16:31.492
  I mean, I don't know
  much about baseball,

16:31.494 --> 16:32.860
but I can tell you this.

16:32.862 --> 16:35.529
I do know who the dad
from "Mr. Belvedere" is.

16:35.531 --> 16:37.031
       I mean,
this dude is like the original

16:37.033 --> 16:39.000
sports-entertainment
   crossover star.

16:39.002 --> 16:41.335
         He was Strahan
         before Strahan.

16:41.337 --> 16:43.604
                Did you know
                that Uribe --

16:43.606 --> 16:45.806
           I spent my best years
                in Milwaukee?

16:45.808 --> 16:46.841
        Word?
                   Mm.

16:46.843 --> 16:48.509
Well, what's it like?
                      Mm.

16:48.511 --> 16:50.945
      The whole town smells
      like beer farts, man.

16:50.947 --> 16:54.048
      Sometimes, I have to learn
that not all boundaries are bad.

16:54.050 --> 16:55.950
 Maybe Jim's right.

16:55.952 --> 16:58.152
                     [Scoffs]
Maybe I do have a problem.

16:58.154 --> 17:00.354
         That is the worst thing
                 about Jim.

17:00.356 --> 17:02.223
                 He's always
             a little bit right.

17:02.225 --> 17:04.825
       He knows just what to say
  to make you question yourself,

17:04.827 --> 17:08.529
           but also, try keeping
        your cooch in your pants

17:08.531 --> 17:10.031
         just a few days a week.
         [Door opens]

17:10.032 --> 17:11.665
              See what happens.

17:13.903 --> 17:16.170
              Oh! You're late.

17:17.839 --> 17:19.507
I had to get a ride from my dad.

17:21.377 --> 17:23.044
      Charles.

17:23.046 --> 17:25.546
        Hey!
  Come on, Charles.

17:25.548 --> 17:28.382
What, are you mad I stopped
and got a roadie? Come on.

17:28.384 --> 17:29.717
'Cause I'm what's known
       as a --

17:29.719 --> 17:31.652
I'm a functional alcoholic.
                       Really?

17:31.654 --> 17:32.653
        Yeah.

17:32.655 --> 17:34.021
                Yeah, really?

17:34.023 --> 17:35.656
           What's your function?

17:35.658 --> 17:37.358
       I-I --

17:37.360 --> 17:39.160
   Because it used to be calling
    games for the Major Leagues,

17:39.162 --> 17:40.661
            but that's gone now.

17:40.663 --> 17:42.229
               You used to get
     sober enough to call games,

17:42.231 --> 17:44.065
         and now there's nothing
              to slow you down.

17:44.067 --> 17:45.533
What about a podcast, huh?

17:45.535 --> 17:46.867
 Now, I know we were
very angry with each other

17:46.869 --> 17:48.436
   when I got back
    from Atlanta,

17:48.438 --> 17:50.237
but there's no reason for us
to stop that thing, Charles.

17:50.239 --> 17:52.373
 We got a good thing
    going there.

17:52.375 --> 17:54.375
We can use it as a platform

17:54.377 --> 17:57.578
  to launch a new,
 um, network dealy.

17:58.681 --> 18:00.781
             That is the logical
              thing to do, yes.

18:01.784 --> 18:05.219
             And I will do it...
               if you do this.

18:06.255 --> 18:09.423
   "Sobertunities
Clean Leaving Center"?

18:09.425 --> 18:11.392
 I've already set everything up.
     All you have to do is call.

18:11.394 --> 18:12.560
    Oh, God, Ch--

18:12.562 --> 18:14.061
    Friends don't
 hand friends cards

18:14.063 --> 18:15.896
  to horribly named
rehab facilities, okay?

18:15.898 --> 18:20.034
       Actually, that is exactly
          what friends do, okay?

18:20.036 --> 18:22.570
     I can't make you call them.
                I know that.

18:22.572 --> 18:24.438
          But if you don't call,

18:24.440 --> 18:26.941
             I'm never speaking
                to you again.

18:26.943 --> 18:28.876
Aw, come on. What are you,
serious with this shit?

18:28.878 --> 18:30.878
                 Yes, I am.
                    Okay?

18:30.880 --> 18:35.116
              Goodbye, podcast.
   Goodbye, you and me, forever.

18:35.118 --> 18:37.318
                    Okay?

18:37.320 --> 18:39.587
                  That is,
           unless you get sober.

18:39.589 --> 18:41.055
 Unless I get sober.
                         Yeah.

18:41.057 --> 18:42.590
        And it's -- Part of it's
          my fault. I know that.

18:42.592 --> 18:43.824
         I've been enabling you.

18:43.826 --> 18:45.593
           We have a codependent
                relationship.

18:45.595 --> 18:47.895
[Groans] Where'd you pick up
language like that, God damn it?

18:47.897 --> 18:49.563
               I went to a few
              Al-Anon meetings.

18:49.565 --> 18:51.298
       Oh, no,
you didn't, Charles.

18:51.300 --> 18:52.967
The only thing worse
  than the program

18:52.969 --> 18:55.002
   is the program
about the program, okay?

18:55.004 --> 18:57.004
And there's nothing wrong
with codependency, alright?

18:57.006 --> 18:59.640
It just lets you and me work
through my problems together.

18:59.642 --> 19:01.575
            Quit dicking around!

19:01.577 --> 19:03.944
                    Jim.

19:03.946 --> 19:06.447
     If you don't stop drinking,
           you are going to die.

19:06.449 --> 19:08.616
  [Sighs, snores]
           Just stop. Plea--

19:08.618 --> 19:10.251
            Why won't you stop?!

19:10.253 --> 19:11.986
                 Why is this
        such a problem for you?!

19:11.988 --> 19:15.623
 People only like me
when I am drunk, Charles, okay?

19:15.625 --> 19:16.991
 You know it's true.

19:16.993 --> 19:18.826
You did the focus testing.

19:18.828 --> 19:20.194
It's science, right?

19:20.196 --> 19:21.595
    Yes, alright.

19:21.597 --> 19:22.863
   Everything bad
 in my life happened

19:22.865 --> 19:24.465
because of my drinking --
        Okay.

19:24.467 --> 19:27.201
Also, everything good
in my life, alright?

19:27.203 --> 19:29.170
First game I ever called
   in Kansas City,

19:29.172 --> 19:32.006
had to do four shots of whiskey
to calm my nerves, alright?

19:32.008 --> 19:34.809
I was blackout drunk
for George Brett's 3,000th hit.

19:34.811 --> 19:36.977
They still play that call
at the Baseball Hall of Fame.

19:36.979 --> 19:39.814
Jules, she's the love
 of my life, right?

19:39.816 --> 19:42.483
  That relationship
was built on drinking!

19:42.485 --> 19:44.218
 Okay, I don't know
who the hell I would be

19:44.220 --> 19:45.219
if I was sober, Charles.

19:45.221 --> 19:46.620
But I do know nobody would

19:46.622 --> 19:49.023
give a shit about that guy,
   whoever he is.

19:49.025 --> 19:51.358
                  I would.

19:51.360 --> 19:52.726
       [Sighs]

19:52.728 --> 19:53.961
             And I hope one day
             I get to meet him.

19:53.963 --> 19:58.132
              But, until then,
                goodbye, Jim.

19:58.134 --> 20:00.167
   "Goodbye, Jim."

20:00.169 --> 20:02.136
     Okay, well,
 fuck you, Charles.

20:02.138 --> 20:04.805
Okay? My back was sore from
carrying you around, anyway.

20:04.807 --> 20:06.006
 And you know what?!

20:06.008 --> 20:07.842
Your parents were right
     about you!

20:07.844 --> 20:09.743
You are a very selfish
     young man,

20:09.745 --> 20:13.247
and you are destined
to fail with that attitude!

20:13.249 --> 20:15.749
       Go on!
  Get out of here!

20:15.751 --> 20:18.719
