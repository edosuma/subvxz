15:40.273 --> 15:42.150
I am authorized
to place you both under arrest!

15:44.110 --> 15:45.862
Under arrest, eh?

15:52.577 --> 15:54.454
I want to go home right now!

16:01.586 --> 16:03.884
This is the part where you run away.

16:07.675 --> 16:09.222
And don't come back!

16:16.267 --> 16:18.395
Can I just say? That was incredible.

16:18.561 --> 16:20.734
Man, they were trippin' over
themselves to get away from you.

16:20.897 --> 16:22.899
- I like that.
- Oh, good, I'm glad.

16:23.065 --> 16:25.443
Now, why don't you go celebrate
your narrow escape with your friends.

16:25.610 --> 16:27.612
- But I don't have any friends.
- Now there's a shocker.

16:27.778 --> 16:29.997
Say, you lost or something?

16:30.156 --> 16:32.705
No, I'm just trying to figure out
the best route to Duloc.

16:32.867 --> 16:35.416
Oh. Duloc?

16:37.079 --> 16:39.332
I know Duloc.
You gotta let me show you the way,

16:39.499 --> 16:41.797
because I am like a GPS with fur!

16:43.336 --> 16:46.385
- I'll be fine on my own, thanks.
- But nobody's fine on their own!

16:46.547 --> 16:48.049
Not when you look like we do!

16:48.216 --> 16:50.344
Hey! Didn't you hear
what they said?

16:50.510 --> 16:53.889
Man, this place is goin' Stepford!
We gotta join forces!

16:54.055 --> 16:56.808
Otherwise they'll lock me up,
and I cannot go back in a cage!

16:56.974 --> 16:57.975
I don't know if I
mentioned this or not,

16:58.142 --> 17:01.612
but I did six years in solitary
for impersonating a piñata.

17:06.400 --> 17:10.280
Oh! That was really scary.

17:10.820 --> 17:12.789
And if that don't work,
if you don't mind my saying,

17:12.949 --> 17:14.791
your breath will
certainly get the job done.

17:15.867 --> 17:19.998
Listen, little donkey,
take a look at me. What am I?

17:20.164 --> 17:23.338
- Really green?
- No! I'm an ogre!

17:23.501 --> 17:25.595
You know,
grab your torch and pitchforks!

17:25.752 --> 17:27.380
- Doesn't that bother you?
- Nope.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.595
- Really?
- Really, really.

17:29.757 --> 17:34.354
- Oh.
- Damn, I like you. What's your name?

17:35.346 --> 17:36.472
- Shrek.
-  Shrek?

17:36.639 --> 17:37.811
Well, you know
what I like about you, Shrek?

17:37.974 --> 17:40.648
You got that whole, "I don't care
what anybody thinks of me" thing.

17:40.810 --> 17:43.029
I like that.
I respect that, Shrek.

the Muffin Man.

Mirror, mirror, on the wall, is this not
the most perfect kingdom of them all?

23:59.855 --> 24:04.861
Ah, yes, Duloc is a wondrous land,
but there's one thing you forgot.

24:05.027 --> 24:08.201
You are not a king, My Liege,
and so a kingdom this is not.

24:08.364 --> 24:10.366
Uh, Thelonius.

24:10.532 --> 24:13.160
You were saying?

24:13.327 --> 24:16.422
What I mean is, you're not a king yet,
but you can become one.

24:16.580 --> 24:18.378
All you have to do is
marry a princess.

24:18.540 --> 24:21.464
- Go on.
- So just sit back and relax, My Lord,

three lives in a dragon-guarded castle,</i>

<i>- But don't let that cool you off.</i>

25:09.967 --> 25:12.641

- or bachelorette number three?
- They're all so nice. I don't know.

One, two, three, one, three, one?

25:27.776 --> 25:31.701

Except for that dragon and lava thing.
I'll have to find someone else to go.

25:51.425 --> 25:53.769
You know, I should probably mention
this little thing about the princess

25:53.927 --> 25:55.725
- that happens at night.
- I will make Fiona my queen,

25:55.888 --> 25:57.765

57:10.594 --> 57:14.189
but thy deed is great,
and thine heart is pure.

57:14.348 --> 57:18.478
- I am eternally in your debt.
- Uh...

57:18.644 --> 57:22.865
And where would a brave knight be
without his noble steed?

57:23.023 --> 57:25.697
All right! Hope you heard that.
She called me a "noble steed!"

57:25.859 --> 57:27.702
She think I'm a steed.

57:29.529 --> 57:33.955
Well, Sir Shrek, the battle is won.
You may remove your helmet.

57:34.117 --> 57:36.711
- Uh... no.
-Why not?

57:36.870 --> 57:39.794
I... I have helmet hair.

57:40.040 --> 57:43.886
Please, I wouldest look
upon the face of my rescuer.

57:44.044 --> 57:46.843
Oh, no, you wouldn't-est.

57:49.424 --> 57:51.222
But how will you kiss me?

57:51.385 --> 57:53.854
What? That wasn't
in the job description.

57:54.012 --> 57:55.810
Maybe it's a perk.

57:55.973 --> 58:00.399
No, it's destiny. "A princess
is rescued by a brave knight

58:00.560 --> 58:03.029
and then they share
true love's first kiss."

58:03.188 --> 58:06.237
With Shrek? Oh!
You think that Shrek is your true love?

58:06.400 --> 58:08.243
Wah-wah!

58:08.402 --> 58:11.326
- Oh, no.
- What's so funny?

58:11.488 --> 58:14.788
Well, let's just say
I'm not your type, OK?

58:14.950 --> 58:17.294
Of course you are. You're my rescuer!
Now remove your helmet.

58:17.452 --> 58:19.580
Look, I really don't think
that's a good idea.

58:19.746 --> 58:21.089
- Just take off the helmet.
- I'm not going to.

58:21.248 --> 58:22.215
- Take it off!
- No!

58:22.374 --> 58:24.172
- Now!
- OK! Whoa. Easy.

58:26.253 --> 58:28.347
As you command,
Your Highness.

58:41.143 --> 58:42.690
You're an ogre.

58:43.186 --> 58:45.735
Oh, you were expecting
Prince Charming?

58:46.440 --> 58:48.158
Well, yes, actually.

58:48.859 --> 58:51.863
Oh, no. I'm supposed to be rescued
by my true love.

58:52.029 --> 58:54.999
- Not by some ogre and his pet.
- Oh...

58:55.741 --> 58:58.290
- Well, so much for "noble steed."
- You're not supposed to be an ogre.

58:58.452 --> 59:02.753
Princess, I was sent to rescue you
by Lord Farquaad, OK?

59:02.914 --> 59:04.291
He's the one who
wants to marry you.

59:04.458 --> 59:06.005
Then why didn't he
come and rescue me?

59:06.168 --> 59:08.762
Good question. You should ask him that
when we get there tomorrow.

59:08.920 --> 59:10.297
Tomorrow?

59:10.464 --> 59:12.307
- Oh, my gosh, it's almost sunset!
- So?

59:12.466 --> 59:15.140
Oh, uh... I didn't realize
it was so late. We need to make camp.

59:15.302 --> 59:17.145
Camp?
But you've just escaped!

59:17.304 --> 59:19.022
Yes, and I found the whole ordeal
quite exhausting.

59:19.181 --> 59:20.182
I need to rest immediately.

59:20.348 --> 59:21.816
That's unfortunate,
because we're gonna keep going.

59:21.975 --> 59:23.977
I need to find somewhere
to camp right now!

59:24.978 --> 59:27.322
Very well.
There's a cave right there.

59:27.481 --> 59:29.404
- That is no place for a princess.
- No, it's perfect.

59:29.566 --> 59:30.818
Well, gentlemen,
I bid thee good night!

59:30.984 --> 59:32.736
You want me to read you a bedtime story?
'Cause I will.

59:32.903 --> 59:34.155
I said good night!

59:36.990 --> 59:38.412
She seems nice.

59:42.162 --> 59:45.006
<i>"By day one way,
by night another,</i>

59:45.165 --> 59:50.012
<i>this shall be the norm, until
you find true love's first kiss</i>

59:50.170 --> 59:53.219
<i>and then take love's true form."</i>

59:57.469 --> 01:00:00.393
And this is what I realized,
if we escaped a dragon,

01:00:00.555 --> 01:00:03.274
man, we could do anything.

01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:06.152
Hey, I could be a steed.

01:00:06.311 --> 01:00:09.736
Ooh! Or I could work
the Crusades circuit if I wanted to.

01:00:10.857 --> 01:00:15.408
I could even be one of those horses
that pulls those wagons full of beer!

01:00:19.533 --> 01:00:22.537
I'd have to get some hair extensions
on my ankles, but I could do it.

01:00:25.455 --> 01:00:28.254
- Who do you wanna be?
- I don't want to be anyone.

01:00:28.416 --> 01:00:29.668
Just for fun, though,
who would you pick?

01:00:29.835 --> 01:00:31.212
- I wouldn't. Donkey...
- No, but if you had to.

01:00:31.378 --> 01:00:33.301
Like, if a guy had a sword
at your throat and he was like,

01:00:33.463 --> 01:00:36.433
"Look here, you can't be an ogre
anymore, pick something else,"

01:00:36.591 --> 01:00:37.934
then who would you pick?

01:00:38.093 --> 01:00:41.222
I would pick that guy up
and hurl him into a tree!

01:00:42.139 --> 01:00:44.016
Man, you are no fun at all,
you know it?

01:00:44.182 --> 01:00:47.231
Is this what it's gonna be like
when we finish rescuing the princess?

01:00:47.394 --> 01:00:49.567
Us sitting around our swamp
all day doing nothing?

01:00:49.729 --> 01:00:54.030
Our swamp? Donkey, there is no "our."
There's no "we."

01:00:54.192 --> 01:00:57.241
There's just me and my swamp.
And when I do get back,

01:00:57.404 --> 01:01:01.204
the first thing I'm going to do is
build a ten-foot wall around my land.

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:07.543
You cut me deep, Shrek.

01:01:09.082 --> 01:01:11.335
You cut me real deep just now.

01:01:12.919 --> 01:01:15.593
What's your problem anyway?
What you got against the whole world?

01:01:15.755 --> 01:01:18.099
I'm not the one with
the problem, OK?

01:01:18.258 --> 01:01:21.432
It's the world who seems
to have a problem with me.

01:01:21.595 --> 01:01:25.099
You saw how that princess reacted.
That's how it always is.

01:01:25.265 --> 01:01:30.817
People take one look at me and it's all,
"Help! A big, stupid, ugly ogre!"

01:01:34.274 --> 01:01:37.528
They judge me
before they even know me.

01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:41.949
That's why I'm
better off alone.

01:01:44.910 --> 01:01:46.958
But you know what, Shrek?

01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:49.088
When we met,

01:01:49.247 --> 01:01:52.797
I didn't think you <i>was</i> just
a big, stupid, ugly ogre.

01:01:58.131 --> 01:01:59.428
Yeah, I know.

01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:09.814

for my behavior yesterday.

01:12:27.426 --> 01:12:31.431
We obviously got off on the wrong foot,
and I would like to make it up to you.

01:12:31.597 --> 01:12:33.224
- You would?
- Yes.

01:12:33.391 --> 01:12:36.019
You did rescue me, after all.

01:12:36.185 --> 01:12:39.189
So I've gathered a basket
of berries for the trip,

01:12:39.355 --> 01:12:44.077
and I made you each...
 a daisy chain!

01:12:44.235 --> 01:12:47.535
Oh, wow! Look at these!
They're beautiful, Princess!

01:12:47.697 --> 01:12:50.576
- Aren't they beautiful, Shrek?
- Oh... Oh...

01:12:50.741 --> 01:12:54.587
Oh! You'll grow to love them,
I promise. Lead the way!

01:12:55.413 --> 01:12:57.666
So, uh...

01:13:00.459 --> 01:13:03.554
So, Princess,
do you often frolic with rats?

01:13:03.713 --> 01:13:04.680
And what if I do?

01:13:04.839 --> 01:13:08.343
Oh, I don't know, Princess,
germ-infested vermin,

01:13:08.509 --> 01:13:10.102
not exactly what I expected.

01:13:10.261 --> 01:13:14.186
Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people
before you get to know them.

01:13:14.348 --> 01:13:15.349
Ouch!

01:13:17.435 --> 01:13:22.487
So, tell me about my groom-to-be,
Lord Farquaad. What's he like?

01:13:22.648 --> 01:13:27.119
Well, um,
let me put it this way, Princess,

01:13:27.278 --> 01:13:31.158
men of Farquaad's stature
are in short supply.

01:13:32.450 --> 01:13:36.171
- Really?
- Yeah, but he is a little intimidating.

01:13:36.329 --> 01:13:39.924
- Well, he must be!
- And yet very good at small talk.

01:13:46.672 --> 01:13:48.515
What are you guys doing?

01:13:48.674 --> 01:13:53.851
What? Just saying you might
want to lower your expectations a bit.

01:13:56.390 --> 01:13:58.484
Yes, like three feet or so.

01:13:58.643 --> 01:14:02.693
All right, all right, yuck it up.
It doesn't bother me. Not today.

01:14:02.855 --> 01:14:06.610
After a lifetime of misery,
things are finally going my way.

01:14:06.776 --> 01:14:10.872
Oh...
A lifetime of misery, right. OK.

01:14:17.286 --> 01:14:18.629
- You chuckled.
- Huh?

01:14:18.788 --> 01:14:22.213
When I said "lifetime of misery,"
you chuckled.

01:14:23.542 --> 01:14:24.919
- Did I?
- Yes.

01:14:25.086 --> 01:14:29.967
Look, I'm sure it was very difficult
living in a dragon-guarded tower.

01:14:30.132 --> 01:14:31.850
- It was.
- I'm sure.

01:14:34.261 --> 01:14:35.729
All right, then.

01:14:37.556 --> 01:14:40.400
Although, it must've been nice
to have a roof and a cozy bed.

01:14:40.559 --> 01:14:42.857
Which is more
than I had when I left home.

01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:45.864
You're not actually comparing yourself
to what I endured?

01:14:46.023 --> 01:14:50.153
I'm just saying you don't corner
the market on unhappy childhoods.

01:14:50.319 --> 01:14:53.619
There are things you
don't know, you know.

01:14:53.781 --> 01:14:55.658
About me.
About how rough I had it!

01:14:55.825 --> 01:14:58.248
What, you run out of
shampoo a couple of times?

01:14:59.912 --> 01:15:02.131
- I mean about my life!
- In that cushy tower of yours?

01:15:02.289 --> 01:15:04.007

01:25:19.031 --> 01:25:22.911
we use squirrel gizzards and mulch.
They just melt in your mouth!

01:25:23.076 --> 01:25:24.919
- I need to sit down for a minute.
- No, no sitting down.

01:25:25.078 --> 01:25:30.209

- No, wait, Shrek, I... Um...

01:25:30.375 --> 01:25:32.878
Well, look, I may not get another chance
to try one of those s'nothers.

01:25:37.382 --> 01:25:40.181
Duloc could wait
until morning?

01:25:40.344 --> 01:25:41.311
- Morning?
- Why not?

01:25:41.470 --> 01:25:45.225
I've spent my whole life without
true love. What's one more night?

01:25:47.100 --> 01:25:50.730
- All right, I'll find us some dinner.
-  I'll get the firewood.

01:25:50.896 --> 01:25:52.864
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Oh, my gosh, I'm so...

01:25:53.023 --> 01:25:54.024

- I should have...

01:25:54.191 --> 01:25:56.535

I'd want to say a few things to you.

- What?

01:29:44.170 --> 01:29:45.843
Wait a minute.
I see what's going on here.

01:29:46.006 --> 01:29:47.474
You're afraid of the
dark, aren't you?

01:29:47.632 --> 01:29:51.102
Yes, that's it. I'm terrified.
You know what? I'd better go inside.

01:29:51.261 --> 01:29:53.889
Don't worry, I used to be
afraid of the dark, too, until...

01:29:54.055 --> 01:29:56.183
Oh! No, wait.
I'm still afraid of the dark!

01:29:58.226 --> 01:30:00.570

- Oh. All right.

01:30:00.729 --> 01:30:03.733

01:30:08.153 --> 01:30:09.154
Uh-uh.

01:30:09.321 --> 01:30:11.289
No, sir. I'm sorry,
but I did not come this whole way,

01:30:11.448 --> 01:30:12.574
putting up with you
and your body odor,

01:30:12.741 --> 01:30:14.414
just so you can let her
walk away like that!

01:30:14.576 --> 01:30:17.546
- What are you talking about?
- I'm an animal, and I got instincts.

01:30:18.163 --> 01:30:20.006
And you two were obviously
digging on each other.

01:30:20.165 --> 01:30:22.839
Oh, you're crazy.
I'm just bringing her back to Farquaad.

01:30:23.001 --> 01:30:24.844
So you don't have
any feelings for her at all?

01:30:25.003 --> 01:30:29.975
Look, even if I did and
I'm not saying I do, because I don't.

01:30:30.133 --> 01:30:32.056
She's a princess and I'm...

01:30:32.218 --> 01:30:34.016
- An ogre?
- Yeah.

01:30:34.179 --> 01:30:36.523
- An ogre.
- She needs to know.

01:30:36.681 --> 01:30:38.149
- Hey, where you going?
- To get more wood,

01:30:38.308 --> 01:30:40.060
before your fire dies.

01:30:57.452 --> 01:30:58.453

01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:04.418

Princess, where are you?

01:31:08.338 --> 01:31:10.636
Princess, it's very spooky in here,
I ain't playing no games... Oh!

01:31:10.799 --> 01:31:12.597
- No! Help! Shrek!
- Oh, no, no, no! It's OK!

01:31:12.759 --> 01:31:15.888
- What'd you do with the princess?
- Donkey, I am the princess. It's me.

01:31:16.054 --> 01:31:19.479
- In this body.
- Oh, my God. You ate the princess!

01:31:19.641 --> 01:31:22.770
Can you hear me? Keep breathing!
I'll get you out of there!

01:31:22.936 --> 01:31:24.233
Donkey!

01:31:26.314 --> 01:31:27.315
Princess?

01:31:28.733 --> 01:31:30.235
What happened to you?

01:31:30.402 --> 01:31:33.406
"By day one way,
by night another,

01:31:33.571 --> 01:31:37.201
this shall be the norm, until
you find true love's first kiss

01:31:37.367 --> 01:31:40.120
and then take love's true form."

01:31:40.286 --> 01:31:43.130
That's beautiful.
I didn't know you wrote poetry.

01:31:43.289 --> 01:31:45.542
Donkey, it's a curse.
I've had it since I was girl.

01:31:45.709 --> 01:31:48.212
- A curse?
- A witch cast a spell on me.

01:31:48.378 --> 01:31:51.882
Now every night, when the sun
goes down I become this...

01:31:52.048 --> 01:31:53.595
...this horrible,
ugly beast!

01:31:53.758 --> 01:31:56.227
All right, calm down,
you're not that ugly.

01:31:58.096 --> 01:32:00.519
OK, I'm not gonna lie,
you are ugly,

01:32:00.682 --> 01:32:05.279
but you only look like this at night.
Shrek's ugly 24/7.

01:32:05.437 --> 01:32:08.236
- Wait a second, that's perfect!
- Perfect? Donkey,

01:32:08.398 --> 01:32:11.072
if Lord Farquaad finds out I look
like this, he'll never marry me!

01:32:11.234 --> 01:32:13.908
- So?
- So, I have to kiss my true love!

01:32:14.070 --> 01:32:17.165
The kiss is the only thing that will
break the spell and make me beautiful.

01:32:17.323 --> 01:32:20.167
But, you know,
you're kind of an ogre, and Shrek...

01:32:20.326 --> 01:32:21.953
Well, you got a lot in common.

01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:23.463
- Shrek?
- Yeah, if he knew all this,

01:32:23.621 --> 01:32:25.373
- I think maybe...
- No, wait, wait, wait, he can't know.

01:32:25.540 --> 01:32:28.464
And you can't tell him! Not a word!
No one must ever know!

01:32:28.626 --> 01:32:30.924
- Promise you won't tell. Promise!
- All right, all right.

01:32:31.087 --> 01:32:34.637
I won't tell him.
But you should.

01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:37.017
Man, I know when
this is all over,

01:32:37.177 --> 01:32:39.475
I'm gonna need a whole lot

That's why I can't stay here with Shrek.

01:36:04.550 --> 01:36:10.057

after is to marry my one true love.

You don't have to tell me anything.
I heard enough last night.

01:37:16.914 --> 01:37:18.541
- You heard what I said?
- Every word.

01:37:18.708 --> 01:37:22.963
Especially, "Who could love
such a hideous, ugly beast?"

01:37:23.129 --> 01:37:25.006
But I thought
that wouldn't matter to you.

01:37:25.173 --> 01:37:27.267

- As promised. Now about my swamp...

01:37:57.955 --> 01:38:02.301

the deed has been put in your name.

01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:04.633

I change my mind.

01:38:21.854 --> 01:38:25.484
That is so sweet, but you don't have
to waste good manners on the ogre.

01:38:25.650 --> 01:38:27.152
It's not like it has feelings.

01:38:27.318 --> 01:38:30.413
No, you're right, it doesn't.

for the perfect groom?

01:38:53.845 --> 01:38:55.347
Lord Farquaad, I accept.
Nothing would make me...

01:39:01.894 --> 01:39:06.149
Oh. Anxious, are we?
You're right. The sooner the better.

01:39:06.315 --> 01:39:10.240
There's so much to do! Captain,
ride ahead. Tell them it's a Code Red!

01:39:10.403 --> 01:39:12.952
We'll be married by sunset!

01:39:13.114 --> 01:39:16.368
Oh, man, there's nothing
like a good night's sleep. Oh!

01:39:16.534 --> 01:39:19.083
- What did I miss?
- Fare thee well, ogre.

01:39:22.373 --> 01:39:25.172
Shrek! Shrek, what are you doing?
You're letting her get away!

01:39:25.334 --> 01:39:27.553
Look, there's something you don't know!
I talked to her last night and...

01:39:27.712 --> 01:39:29.385
Yeah, I know you
talked to her last night.

01:39:29.547 --> 01:39:32.642
You two are great pals, aren't you?
So why don't you follow her home?

01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:35.474

Nobody else, understand?!

01:39:40.683 --> 01:39:42.356

Me, me, me!" Well, guess what?

01:48:59.992 --> 01:49:03.087
Now it's my turn, so you just shut up
and pay attention.

01:49:04.121 --> 01:49:05.623
You are mean to me.

01:49:10.544 --> 01:49:13.798
You insult me and you do not
appreciate anything I do.

01:49:13.964 --> 01:49:15.762
You're always pushing me around
or pushing me away!

01:49:15.924 --> 01:49:19.895
You're so wrapped up in layers, onion
boy, you're afraid of your own feelings!

01:49:20.054 --> 01:49:22.182
Well, if I treated you so badly,
why did you come back?

01:49:22.347 --> 01:49:24.315
Because that's what friends do,
they forgive each other!

01:49:24.475 --> 01:49:25.476
Go away!

01:49:25.642 --> 01:49:27.895
There you are doing it again!
Just like you did to Fiona!

01:49:28.062 --> 01:49:30.531
All she ever did was like you.
Maybe even love you!

01:49:30.689 --> 01:49:33.442
Love me?
She said I was ugly!

01:49:33.609 --> 01:49:36.328
A hideous creature!
I heard the two of you talking!

01:49:36.487 --> 01:49:39.161
She wasn't talking about you!
She was talking about hersel...

01:49:41.700 --> 01:49:42.872
...someone else.

01:49:43.035 --> 01:49:46.835
She wasn't talking about me?
Well then, who was she talking about?

01:49:46.997 --> 01:49:49.170
No, sir. I ain't saying nothing.

01:49:49.333 --> 01:49:50.801
You don't wanna listen to me, right?
Right?

01:49:50.959 --> 01:49:52.256
- Donkey!
- No.

01:49:55.964 --> 01:49:57.682
OK, look, I'm sorry, all right?

01:50:00.302 --> 01:50:01.303
I'm sorry.

01:50:02.262 --> 01:50:07.689
I guess I am just
a big, stupid, ugly ogre.

01:50:10.604 --> 01:50:12.151
Can you forgive me?

01:50:15.692 --> 01:50:16.864
Hey, that's what friends are for,
right?

01:50:17.027 --> 01:50:18.028
Right.

01:50:20.823 --> 01:50:22.917
- Friends?
- Oh! Friends!

01:50:25.327 --> 01:50:27.500
So, what did Fiona
say about me?

01:50:27.663 --> 01:50:29.916
What are you asking me for?
Why don't you just go ask her?

01:50:30.082 --> 01:50:31.379
Donkey!
The wedding!

01:50:31.542 --> 01:50:34.546
- We'll never make it in time!
- I know someone who can help!

01:51:07.619 --> 01:51:11.089
People of Duloc,

01:51:11.248 --> 01:51:15.128
we gather here today to bear witness

01:51:15.294 --> 01:51:19.595
to the union of our
new king and queen.

01:51:19.756 --> 01:51:25.513
And as the warm glow
of this setting sun lifts our heads,

01:51:25.679 --> 01:51:28.102
so too does the...

01:51:28.265 --> 01:51:31.439
Excuse me.
Could we just skip to the "I do's"?

01:51:31.602 --> 01:51:34.606
- What?
- Uh, yeah. Go on, go on.

01:51:34.771 --> 01:51:37.945
Right, well then, do you, Lord Farquaad,
take Princess Fiona?

01:51:38.108 --> 01:51:39.109
- I do.
- And do you...

01:51:39.276 --> 01:51:41.028
- I do.
- Yes, I thought you might.

01:51:41.195 --> 01:51:42.572
Well, then,
by the power vested in me...

01:51:42.738 --> 01:51:43.955
- Stop the wedding!
- Shrek?

01:51:44.114 --> 01:51:45.536
What does he want?
Really, it's rude enough

01:51:45.699 --> 01:51:49.624
being alive when no one wants you,
but showing up uninvited to a wedding?

01:51:49.786 --> 01:51:51.834
- Fiona, I need to talk to you.
- Oh, now you want to talk?

01:51:51.997 --> 01:51:53.999
Well, it's a little late for that,
so if you'll excuse me...

01:51:54.166 --> 01:51:56.089
- But you can't marry him!
- And why not?

01:51:56.251 --> 01:51:58.595
Because he's just marrying you
so he can be king.

01:51:58.754 --> 01:51:59.971
That is outrageous!

01:52:00.130 --> 01:52:02.303
- Fiona, don't listen to him.
- He's not your true love.

01:52:02.466 --> 01:52:03.968
And what do you know
about true love?

01:52:04.134 --> 01:52:08.014
Well... I...

01:52:09.681 --> 01:52:10.807
Um...

01:52:10.974 --> 01:52:14.023
Oh... Oh...

01:52:16.063 --> 01:52:17.861
Aw...

01:52:18.023 --> 01:52:20.492
Well, this is precious. Huh? Hm?

01:52:20.651 --> 01:52:23.700
The ogre has fallen in love
with the princess. Oh, good Lord.

01:52:27.449 --> 01:52:30.293
Mm! Guards, take this abomination
out of my sight!

01:52:30.452 --> 01:52:31.453
No!

01:52:32.829 --> 01:52:36.379
I mean...

01:52:36.541 --> 01:52:40.591
Let's hear what the monster has to say.
It might be worth a laugh.

01:52:41.171 --> 01:52:42.593
Oh, you are awful.

01:52:44.841 --> 01:52:48.596
Well, you heard her, ogre.
Express yourself. Hm?

01:52:48.762 --> 01:52:51.766
With as few grunts as possible.

01:52:55.185 --> 01:52:59.110
