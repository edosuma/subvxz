00:17.664 --> 00:21.430
The Indian knew
that deer moved in circles...

00:21.468 --> 00:25.700
that if the hunter calculated
his moves with skill...

00:25.739 --> 00:29.470
he could run the swift deer
into submission.

00:29.509 --> 00:34.572
Its hooves would bleed,
and the animal stumbled.

00:34.614 --> 00:39.916
The Indian was to kneel
above his dying prey...

00:39.953 --> 00:43.184
putting his mouth
to that of the deer...

00:43.223 --> 00:45.783
stealing its last breath.

00:47.227 --> 00:50.958
While he had earned
the swiftness of the beast...

00:50.997 --> 00:55.866
in its death he was struck by
its peace and stillness...

00:55.902 --> 00:57.893
and by his own.

04:22.676 --> 04:26.305
I tried telling myself
I'd done my job...

04:26.346 --> 04:28.007
defended my life.

04:31.184 --> 04:33.311
But I didn't believe me.

04:33.353 --> 04:38.655
You killed my boy, Joe Roberts.

04:38.692 --> 04:41.388
You killed my baby boy.

04:41.428 --> 04:44.659
This is how houses catch fire.

04:44.698 --> 04:50.193
Murderers' houses! Murderer!

04:50.236 --> 04:53.262
Mrs. Baker, come on.
This isn't helping anything.

04:53.306 --> 04:55.331
He killed my baby!

04:55.375 --> 04:58.344
Robert, you and Jim
want to get Mr. Baker there?

04:58.378 --> 04:59.970
I'm real sorry.

05:02.549 --> 05:07.111
Captain said, John Henry

05:07.153 --> 05:10.554
I'm gonna bring
my steam drill round

05:10.590 --> 05:13.218
Bring my steam drill
out on the job

05:13.259 --> 05:15.386
I'm gonna whup
that steel on down

05:15.428 --> 05:18.556
Lord, Lord, I'm gonna
whup that steel on down

05:18.598 --> 05:21.226
Henry said to Captain

05:21.267 --> 05:24.930
Whoa, man ain't nothin'
but a man...

05:41.821 --> 05:45.450
My brother Frank was due back
from Vietnam within the week.

05:47.560 --> 05:51.428
We hadn't seen each other
since I'd lost the farm in '65.

05:51.464 --> 05:54.956
I took the uniform job
to make ends meet.

05:58.972 --> 06:01.873
In one of his letters,
he complained...

06:01.908 --> 06:03.876
that his fellow soldiers
were disturbed...

06:03.910 --> 06:06.378
by the killing they'd seen.

06:06.413 --> 06:08.881
He wrote...

06:08.915 --> 06:14.012
"Guys over here expect their
hair to stay dry in the rain."

06:34.374 --> 06:35.807
Good.

06:42.449 --> 06:44.542
Your mom called.

06:44.584 --> 06:46.643
Yeah? What's happening?

06:46.686 --> 06:50.952
First the plane was going to be
delayed in Hawaii or somewhere.

06:50.990 --> 06:52.514
Then it was going to be
on time again.

06:52.559 --> 06:57.656
Now she says
9:30 Tuesday for sure.

06:57.697 --> 07:00.257
He's got to go through Fort Dix.

07:07.240 --> 07:08.707
Raffael asleep?

07:08.742 --> 07:11.176
Yes, babe.

07:22.122 --> 07:24.181
You worried about today...

07:24.224 --> 07:27.284
or about Franky coming home?

07:34.134 --> 07:36.625
No. This kid today...

07:41.608 --> 07:44.509
His parents came into
the station making threats.

07:44.544 --> 07:46.409
What threats?

07:48.014 --> 07:49.777
Threats.

07:53.019 --> 07:56.682
When they pulled the father
outside, he started singing.

08:36.996 --> 08:38.587
Joe.

09:49.302 --> 09:52.066
- Don't move!
- Hey! It's me.

09:54.807 --> 09:56.035
Shit.

09:56.075 --> 09:58.441
You scared the hell out of me.
Come here.

10:00.880 --> 10:02.438
I almost kill you!

10:02.482 --> 10:04.643
He's got you trained, ain't he?

10:04.684 --> 10:06.276
You are early.

10:06.319 --> 10:08.787
I didn't want
to hang around Fort Dix...

10:08.821 --> 10:10.288
so I took a Greyhound.

10:10.323 --> 10:12.791
Joey's going to be
so happy to see you.

10:17.897 --> 10:21.060
Joe is so happy to see you.

10:22.368 --> 10:24.836
Come on, baby, come on.

10:24.871 --> 10:27.931
Come on, a little bit.

10:29.842 --> 10:32.003
Hey.

10:33.346 --> 10:36.315
Share with
your Uncle Franky, shorty.

10:36.349 --> 10:38.817
I'm going to take Frank
over to the folks.

10:38.851 --> 10:40.819
I'll be back in a bit.

10:40.853 --> 10:42.320
You'll be here?

10:42.355 --> 10:44.653
Yeah. I've got two lessons
this afternoon.

10:44.691 --> 10:46.818
See you.

10:46.859 --> 10:48.326
Welcome home, Franky.

10:48.361 --> 10:49.692
Bye-bye.

10:50.897 --> 10:52.558
Bye-bye, say...

10:58.905 --> 11:00.304
Bye-bye.

11:00.340 --> 11:02.808
Bye-bye.

11:02.842 --> 11:05.470
Your uncle is a barnyard dog.

11:08.848 --> 11:10.941
Town looks same-same.

11:13.853 --> 11:16.014
So you're a dad, man.

11:16.055 --> 11:17.488
How's that?

11:17.523 --> 11:19.115
Undescribable.

11:21.027 --> 11:22.551
It's great.

11:23.896 --> 11:25.488
He's amazing.

11:31.237 --> 11:32.727
What?

11:32.772 --> 11:34.535
Just looking at you.

11:41.014 --> 11:43.380
Got to admit,
it feels kind of strange...

11:43.416 --> 11:45.884
riding up front
in the man's car...

11:45.918 --> 11:48.512
no handcuffs,
my own brother driving.

11:49.589 --> 11:50.988
Shit.

11:51.024 --> 11:55.791
Remember we used
to plug cop cars with snowballs?

12:31.697 --> 12:33.028
Pull over.

12:38.638 --> 12:42.574
Hey! Don't you do that.

12:42.608 --> 12:43.939
You did it.

13:03.963 --> 13:05.396
Hey, get the cop!

13:07.133 --> 13:09.192
Come on.

13:09.235 --> 13:10.793
All right!

13:12.138 --> 13:13.605
Fire!

13:26.853 --> 13:28.878
King of the mountain!

13:59.018 --> 14:01.578
Need an army to fight me?

14:09.295 --> 14:10.990
What are you doing?

14:17.470 --> 14:21.270
Listen, I just wanted
to see you guys...

14:21.307 --> 14:23.298
meet the baby and all.

14:23.342 --> 14:25.606
I ain't going over
to see Mom and Pop.

14:25.645 --> 14:27.977
What are you talking about?

14:28.014 --> 14:30.482
Franky.

14:30.516 --> 14:34.612
You caught me off balance here.
What are you saying?

14:36.422 --> 14:37.912
Good-bye?

14:41.527 --> 14:44.291
Let's just call it
see you later.

14:46.032 --> 14:49.001
Hey, I came to see you,
brother man.

14:49.035 --> 14:50.662
What about Mom and Dad?

14:50.703 --> 14:52.364
What about them?

14:52.405 --> 14:54.566
You're going
to break their hearts.

15:00.279 --> 15:02.338
You're the one who always
takes shit personal.

15:02.381 --> 15:03.871
Wait.

15:07.019 --> 15:09.453
If anything,
they'll be relieved.

15:09.488 --> 15:10.716
You'll see.

15:10.756 --> 15:12.656
Where are you going?
You got a place to stay?

15:19.532 --> 15:21.056
You got money?

15:21.100 --> 15:23.898
I already took forty bucks
from your wallet.

15:26.572 --> 15:28.563
It's in the glove box.

15:30.743 --> 15:33.769
I don't want you to go.

15:33.813 --> 15:37.374
Hey, Joe, this whole town's
talking about you.

15:37.416 --> 15:38.883
Good shot, boy.

15:38.918 --> 15:40.510
Thanks, sir.

15:44.090 --> 15:46.718
You know, if I could
figure out the difference...

15:46.759 --> 15:51.719
between what gets you a kiss
on the ass and me locked up...

16:06.445 --> 16:08.811
I used to know my brother...

16:08.848 --> 16:12.477
like I used to know
I'd always be a farmer...

16:12.518 --> 16:16.045
but drifting off on the train
that day was a stranger.

16:19.458 --> 16:21.688
He looked like a hero.

16:24.630 --> 16:26.598
The closeness
I felt with my brother...

16:26.632 --> 16:28.691
was with that
rough-and-tumble kid...

16:28.734 --> 16:31.532
I knew before
high school distractions...

16:31.570 --> 16:35.904
and then later my wife and farm
occupied our time together.

16:37.243 --> 16:41.202
In the last few years
before going overseas...

16:41.247 --> 16:45.343
Frank had become branded
the hell-raiser of town...

16:45.384 --> 16:48.217
that he'd come to no good.

16:48.254 --> 16:51.223
Maybe leaving so suddenly
was the only mercy he knew...

16:51.257 --> 16:54.249
for the grief
he'd caused before.

16:56.262 --> 17:00.266
As for my parents,
Franky was right.

17:00.266 --> 17:02.791
They would not
take it personally.

17:05.237 --> 17:08.205
They say some of
the boys coming back...

17:08.240 --> 17:10.299
are coming back real confused.

17:11.743 --> 17:13.712
Frank left confused.

17:13.746 --> 17:16.714
Well, maybe
it'll straighten him out.

17:16.749 --> 17:18.307
That's what Randall said.

17:18.351 --> 17:23.288
Oh, my God, now my boy's
comparing his mama to a moron.

17:23.321 --> 17:26.257
It wasn't a comparison, Mom.

17:27.727 --> 17:31.254
He's a very restless boy,
that Franky.

17:31.297 --> 17:34.562
That's what got him
into trouble, you know.

17:34.600 --> 17:36.261
That's why he left.

17:36.302 --> 17:39.396
I thought maybe
he just hated cops.

17:42.174 --> 17:43.732
Don't say that.

17:48.314 --> 17:50.305
Listen to your mama.

17:52.251 --> 17:55.049
You are a good man, you hear me?

17:55.087 --> 17:57.385
You are a good man.

17:57.423 --> 17:59.721
That don't exempt you
from having the time come...

17:59.759 --> 18:02.193
when you have to kill a man.

18:02.228 --> 18:04.719
You can't regret it.

18:04.764 --> 18:08.461
If it hadn't have been him,
it might have been my son.

18:08.501 --> 18:13.200
No, sir. Don't you regret it.

18:13.239 --> 18:15.207
You just keep saying
the Serenity Prayer...

18:15.241 --> 18:17.232
and you get on with it.

18:34.326 --> 18:38.353
We didn't see or hear from Frank
for a good six months...

18:39.965 --> 18:42.297
when our lives took a turn.

19:32.551 --> 19:35.315
There was a crack
of thunder outside.

19:35.354 --> 19:37.322
Mrs. Roberts must have
jumped a foot off...

19:37.356 --> 19:38.823
Do you want anything?

19:38.858 --> 19:41.827
No. I know where it is.
Thank you.

19:41.861 --> 19:45.297
She sure could make
good apple pie.

19:45.331 --> 19:47.993
Do you need anything?

19:48.033 --> 19:50.024
No. Thanks, Maria.

19:51.370 --> 19:52.837
Thanks.

19:58.377 --> 20:02.177
You know, Joe,
it didn't sit right with me...

20:02.214 --> 20:05.547
when you married
a Mexican woman.

20:05.584 --> 20:09.918
But I look at her today...
she's beautiful.

20:11.590 --> 20:13.751
She's a beautiful
and good woman.

20:17.096 --> 20:18.563
Boy, was I wrong.

20:18.597 --> 20:20.531
I was dead wrong.

20:28.941 --> 20:33.378
I'm going to check
the teletype at the station.

20:33.412 --> 20:36.313
It wouldn't surprise me if he
were somewhere in the system.

20:36.348 --> 20:39.943
He is. Yeah.

20:39.985 --> 20:42.954
He sent out a card
about a month ago...

20:42.988 --> 20:46.947
but I didn't want her to know.

20:46.992 --> 20:49.961
He's got twenty-four more days.

20:49.995 --> 20:53.294
Twenty-three and a wake-up.

20:53.332 --> 20:55.391
Oh, yeah.
I've been counting.

20:57.836 --> 20:59.326
Where is he?

20:59.371 --> 21:00.895
Columbus.

21:00.940 --> 21:06.071
Now, he didn't send a card,
but a girl named Dorothy.

21:06.111 --> 21:09.945
"Dear Mr. And Mrs. Roberts...

21:09.982 --> 21:11.950
"Frank hit me.

21:11.984 --> 21:15.943
"My daddy said
he had to go to jail.

21:15.988 --> 21:19.014
"But don't worry, because
I'm here to take care of him."

21:21.293 --> 21:23.386
He's a likable son of a bitch.

21:23.429 --> 21:26.296
Where does he get it, Joe?

21:26.332 --> 21:28.857
I don't know.

22:41.106 --> 22:46.544
Frank, he took his clothes off
to take a shit!

22:46.578 --> 22:50.241
He took his clothes off
to take a shit.

23:11.103 --> 23:12.764
Look.

23:21.346 --> 23:23.246
That's a great-Iooking kid, Joe.

23:23.282 --> 23:25.716
Thanks.
He has a great-Iooking mama.

23:40.432 --> 23:42.127
What'd she say?

23:42.167 --> 23:44.635
She asked would you mind
playing with the kid...

23:44.670 --> 23:46.638
while we chatted a bit?

23:46.672 --> 23:48.469
Sure thing. Kids love me.

23:48.507 --> 23:49.804
Come here, Raffael.

23:49.842 --> 23:51.935
How you doing, boy?

23:53.178 --> 23:54.668
Incest product?

23:56.115 --> 23:58.481
That ain't really
what she said, is it?

24:00.619 --> 24:02.143
I knew that.

24:02.187 --> 24:06.089
I got a real bad idea
I want to follow through on...

24:06.125 --> 24:07.752
and I need your OK.

24:07.793 --> 24:10.660
It's about Franky, huh?

24:15.534 --> 24:18.662
I want to offer him a room
in our place for a while.

24:18.704 --> 24:21.468
I got to try
and get close to him again.

24:21.507 --> 24:26.308
I got to try... something.

24:26.345 --> 24:30.145
Why do you think he'll want to?

24:30.182 --> 24:33.640
I thought he had that little
masochist waiting for him.

24:33.685 --> 24:36.586
Maybe the little masochist
will come, too.

24:36.622 --> 24:38.146
Now, wait a minute.

24:38.190 --> 24:40.385
No, Maria,
you're probably right.

24:40.425 --> 24:43.223
He probably won't want to come.

24:43.262 --> 24:45.696
Joe, we have a child
in the house.

24:45.731 --> 24:47.995
I've thought about that.

24:48.033 --> 24:49.694
I'd talk to him first.

24:49.735 --> 24:53.193
If he wants to come,
if he wants to bring the girl...

24:53.238 --> 24:56.730
I'd meet her
and decide from there.

24:58.243 --> 25:00.643
I'm not going to say no.

25:05.184 --> 25:06.617
Doggone it!

25:06.652 --> 25:09.644
Raffael,
what did you do that for?

25:09.688 --> 25:12.714
Put sand down my pants for?

25:48.794 --> 25:50.762
I'd spoken
to Franky's jailers...

25:50.796 --> 25:54.254
who told me that releases
didn't start till 10 a.m.

25:54.299 --> 25:56.767
I'd only driven through
three states...

25:56.802 --> 26:00.670
but, man, this country
looks smaller on a map.

27:48.814 --> 27:53.808
Franky seemed to have few enough
moments of tenderness in him.

27:53.852 --> 27:56.514
I didn't need
to interrupt this one.

27:58.557 --> 28:01.526
I thought it better
to wait my turn.

29:17.903 --> 29:19.495
Collect from Joe.

29:20.972 --> 29:23.566
Hiya, baby.
Yeah, I'm still here.

29:27.079 --> 29:28.546
No, I haven't yet.

29:30.482 --> 29:34.441
Well, soon, I figure.

29:34.486 --> 29:37.512
Kid's got me smoking again.

29:39.491 --> 29:41.459
I will.

29:41.493 --> 29:44.951
I know. I will.

29:44.996 --> 29:46.486
I love you.

29:46.531 --> 29:48.522
Bye-bye.

30:21.600 --> 30:24.728
Little sister, that you?

30:24.769 --> 30:26.066
Will big brother do?

30:26.104 --> 30:29.665
How about Winnie the Pooh?

30:29.708 --> 30:31.676
He's in the zoo.

30:31.710 --> 30:33.974
This I knew.

30:34.012 --> 30:35.912
He don't like the view.

30:35.947 --> 30:38.347
'Cause he sniffs glue.

30:38.383 --> 30:40.613
Open your damn door.

30:44.623 --> 30:46.784
Are you sore?

30:56.668 --> 30:59.398
How the hell
did you find me here?

30:59.437 --> 31:00.961
Nice guy.

31:03.074 --> 31:05.008
Are you going to invite me in?

31:20.892 --> 31:22.826
I owe you forty bills.

31:22.861 --> 31:25.557
So... pay me.

31:28.400 --> 31:31.699
Repeat... how the hell
did you find me here today?

31:31.736 --> 31:35.934
Well, I followed you
from the jail...

31:35.974 --> 31:39.102
and I've been sitting
out there across the street...

31:39.144 --> 31:42.079
smoking, which I had quit, but...

31:42.113 --> 31:43.774
You followed me?

31:47.986 --> 31:50.181
What you got there?

31:50.222 --> 31:52.486
You got some squares for me?

32:09.574 --> 32:11.838
Mommy's gone.

32:20.719 --> 32:22.812
Bye, Mommy.

32:35.033 --> 32:37.331
Where the hell is she?

32:52.284 --> 32:55.048
The funeral
was almost a month ago.

32:55.086 --> 32:58.021
I was in fucking jail, Joe.

32:58.056 --> 33:00.217
I know where you were.

33:00.258 --> 33:02.818
What difference does that make?

33:02.861 --> 33:04.624
You wouldn't have known anyway.

33:19.244 --> 33:21.474
What are you doing here?

33:22.781 --> 33:25.875
Did you come here
to fucking guilt me to death?

33:45.236 --> 33:50.435
Meet my old lady
Dorothy or Dotty...

33:50.475 --> 33:55.310
or Doe or Dute or whatever.

33:55.347 --> 33:58.111
Not whatever.

33:58.149 --> 34:00.913
Hi, Dorothy. I'm Joe.

34:00.952 --> 34:02.852
I'm Franky's brother.

34:05.390 --> 34:08.324
Nice to meet you.

34:14.498 --> 34:16.467
Joe followed us.

34:20.304 --> 34:22.795
Like a common criminal.

34:28.413 --> 34:30.108
Well, here's your beer
and stuff.

34:37.589 --> 34:40.114
Joe come here to tell me...

34:44.362 --> 34:46.387
that my mother died.

35:09.354 --> 35:12.881
What do you say
we all go for some chow?

35:12.924 --> 35:15.825
- Piñatas are from Spain.
- From Mexico.

35:15.860 --> 35:19.193
Catch you smoking again in
the motor home, I'll shave you.

35:25.103 --> 35:28.072
That woman has a beard.

35:29.841 --> 35:32.435
That woman has a beard.

35:32.477 --> 35:34.411
Are you saying that twice...

35:34.446 --> 35:38.906
because you think we can't
hear or see or what, girl?

35:38.950 --> 35:43.080
I'm going to go say hello.

35:43.121 --> 35:44.884
You do that.

35:44.923 --> 35:47.517
How do you do?
My name's Dorothy.

35:47.559 --> 35:49.493
Is it real?

35:49.527 --> 35:52.496
A way-out lady I got, huh?

35:52.530 --> 35:55.021
She used to be
one of them flower children...

35:55.066 --> 35:56.863
before I set her course.

36:00.405 --> 36:02.396
All right, come on.

36:07.912 --> 36:10.904
The bigger they come,
the harder they fall.

36:14.419 --> 36:17.877
Frank, I want you
to come back with me.

36:17.922 --> 36:20.482
What?

36:20.525 --> 36:22.390
I knew you were
going to say that.

36:22.427 --> 36:27.922
So, come back with me,
live at the house a while.

36:27.966 --> 36:30.935
Oh, yeah, Maria'd love that.

36:30.969 --> 36:35.929
I got Dorothy. I'm cool.

36:35.974 --> 36:37.942
You're cool?
You're living in a motel.

36:37.976 --> 36:41.434
No. Just for now,
till I find another place.

36:41.479 --> 36:44.471
She's staying
at her folks till then.

36:46.484 --> 36:49.453
Why don't you come back
and spend time with me...

36:49.487 --> 36:53.981
Raffael?
Spend time with the family?

36:55.493 --> 36:58.553
- How's he doing?
- He's OK.

37:02.600 --> 37:04.591
She let me touch it.

37:13.344 --> 37:17.075
She's just a little squirrel,
ain't she?

37:17.115 --> 37:19.242
Bring her with you.

37:20.285 --> 37:21.843
Bring her with you.

37:24.989 --> 37:27.480
What would I do there, man?

37:27.525 --> 37:29.686
Have a few laughs with Pop?

37:32.530 --> 37:34.498
You stay out of trouble.

37:34.532 --> 37:37.501
Get yourself a damn job.

37:37.535 --> 37:40.095
I don't want a damn job.

37:40.138 --> 37:44.370
Besides, I got a deal where
I'm scamming G.I. Bill checks.

37:44.409 --> 37:46.377
Far as Mr. Trouble goes...

37:46.411 --> 37:49.437
he ain't no less
in one place than another.

37:49.480 --> 37:51.573
Why is that, Frank?

37:53.551 --> 37:56.019
I always figured
it was Trouble had a car.

37:56.054 --> 37:58.079
You know what I mean?

38:26.551 --> 38:28.485
The law is here.

38:41.532 --> 38:44.296
Never smoke this stuff
in front of the law.

38:44.335 --> 38:46.462
The law gets upset.

38:46.504 --> 38:48.062
I'm home!

38:50.141 --> 38:52.735
Dispose of the evidence!

38:56.648 --> 38:57.945
Woman.

38:57.982 --> 39:00.416
Man.

39:00.451 --> 39:03.045
- Hey there.
- Hey there.

39:13.097 --> 39:14.724
He didn't come?

39:16.100 --> 39:17.567
I'm sorry, Joe.

39:17.602 --> 39:19.570
No surprise.

39:19.604 --> 39:22.072
Where's the boy?

39:22.106 --> 39:24.506
In there shooting heroin?

39:24.542 --> 39:29.445
Thank you, Lord, for the gift
of this woman's cooking...

39:29.480 --> 39:32.074
for the food to cook...

39:32.116 --> 39:35.882
and the family
we have to share it.

39:35.920 --> 39:37.387
Amen.

39:37.422 --> 39:38.912
Amen.

39:45.129 --> 39:46.790
You want some?

39:55.606 --> 39:59.201
Going to sell the house,
I think.

39:59.243 --> 40:00.642
Are you?

40:00.678 --> 40:02.771
Think so.

40:06.250 --> 40:08.582
Where are you
thinking of living?

40:11.089 --> 40:13.523
There's a trailer park
over on Bright's.

40:13.558 --> 40:15.719
They got
a pretty good deal there.

40:15.760 --> 40:18.194
That's nice there.

40:18.229 --> 40:21.824
They have a vegetable garden
in the back...

40:21.866 --> 40:29.398
where you can rent a plot,
grow your own vegetables.

40:29.440 --> 40:32.170
That's right... vegebulls.

40:32.210 --> 40:33.802
Vegetables.

40:38.282 --> 40:40.307
Vegebulls, that's right.

40:40.351 --> 40:45.687
Did you know your daddy
grew vegebulls, Raffael?

40:45.723 --> 40:53.095
Your daddy was a farmer
before he was a po-lice-man.

40:59.237 --> 41:01.705
Very good, Raffael.

41:08.746 --> 41:10.976
You miss the farm, Joe?

41:11.015 --> 41:13.711
Sometimes.

41:13.751 --> 41:16.652
It's a bitch, ain't it?

41:16.687 --> 41:19.713
The same thieves
that took your farm...

41:19.757 --> 41:21.952
now have you work for them.

41:23.761 --> 41:26.286
We get by fine.

41:27.832 --> 41:30.198
We get by fine.

41:30.234 --> 41:32.702
Oh, sure. Of course you do.

47:50.915 --> 47:53.042
Joe Roberts.

47:53.083 --> 47:56.052
Hey, boy, did I wake you?

47:56.086 --> 47:57.553
Who is it?

47:57.588 --> 48:00.284
It's my father.
No, it's all right.

48:00.324 --> 48:02.656
I'll tell you why I called.

48:02.693 --> 48:05.161
You know
that strip of molding...

48:05.196 --> 48:08.563
that you have between
the kitchen linoleum...

48:08.599 --> 48:12.126
and the carpet
in your living room?

48:13.337 --> 48:16.363
Well, I noticed this evening
that it was loose.

48:16.407 --> 48:18.375
You might get yourself
a screwdriver...

48:18.409 --> 48:21.378
and tighten up on it before
somebody trips and falls.

48:21.412 --> 48:24.904
OK, Dad. Thanks.
I'll take care of it.

48:28.118 --> 48:30.382
Good night, son.

48:30.421 --> 48:32.013
Good night, Pop.

50:20.831 --> 50:22.298
Who is it?

50:22.333 --> 50:23.857
It's me, Joe.

50:26.837 --> 50:28.896
How you doing?

50:30.841 --> 50:33.309
Well, it's pretty early,
Randall.

50:33.344 --> 50:35.869
What's going on?

50:35.913 --> 50:38.780
Got your paper.

50:48.359 --> 50:51.556
Joe, your daddy
shot hisself last night.

51:00.804 --> 51:02.738
Is he dead?

51:11.315 --> 51:13.476
Can I use your john?

53:50.841 --> 53:53.605
Mr. Roberts?

53:55.812 --> 53:57.370
Mr. Roberts?

53:57.414 --> 53:59.382
I just took a telephone call...

53:59.416 --> 54:03.079
from somebody claiming
to be your kin.

54:04.521 --> 54:08.082
I think there's been
some kind of family emergency.

54:14.131 --> 54:15.894
Mr. Roberts?

54:23.907 --> 54:26.307
Did you have
a nice walk up here?

54:26.343 --> 54:28.573
I don't understand.

54:37.054 --> 54:38.578
What are you doing here?

54:38.622 --> 54:40.089
I just told you.

54:40.123 --> 54:42.648
Your family needs you
to get ahold of them...

54:42.693 --> 54:44.661
because apparently
there's been some kind of...

54:44.695 --> 54:46.185
Family emergency.

54:46.229 --> 54:47.696
Right.

54:47.731 --> 54:50.256
OK, thank you.

55:00.611 --> 55:02.101
Did you like that?

55:26.236 --> 55:29.137
Joe, Franky's girl just called.

55:29.172 --> 55:31.572
He didn't want
to get on the line.

55:31.608 --> 55:33.303
Did you tell her?

55:33.343 --> 55:35.368
I told her.

55:35.412 --> 55:37.403
I don't know how
much got through, man.

55:44.154 --> 55:45.815
At least he knows.

55:47.858 --> 55:49.758
Have you been
on my property lately?

55:49.793 --> 55:54.389
Have you seen those hippies
down there with their tents?

55:54.431 --> 55:58.060
They have fires down there
at night, you know.

55:58.101 --> 56:00.934
Well, I sent Randall
down to talk to them.

56:00.971 --> 56:03.439
Why don't you come over
to talk to them?

56:03.473 --> 56:04.940
I'll do that, honey.

56:04.975 --> 56:07.239
- Pardon?
- I'll do that.

56:07.277 --> 56:12.442
Well, if you need
moral support about your dad...

56:12.482 --> 56:14.541
you could just stop by.

56:16.119 --> 56:18.110
I appreciate that.

56:20.290 --> 56:23.384
You just can't carry
that stuff alone.

56:23.427 --> 56:25.395
It's pretty emotional, you know.

56:25.429 --> 56:27.192
I got a family helping me out.

56:27.230 --> 56:28.697
I appreciate it.

56:28.732 --> 56:32.190
Well, sometimes you can
talk to another person...

56:32.235 --> 56:35.227
a lot more openly than
you can your own family.

56:36.239 --> 56:38.230
You know, let it out?

56:39.576 --> 56:44.536
So, if you could just
come over on the property...

56:44.581 --> 56:47.880
and I could even have
something to eat there.

56:47.918 --> 56:51.854
Thank you.
You're a lovely lady.

56:54.725 --> 56:56.090
You afraid of me?

56:56.126 --> 56:58.185
- Am I what?
- Afraid of me?

56:58.228 --> 57:00.696
What do you mean
am I afraid of you?

57:00.731 --> 57:04.189
Can't you open up
and talk to me a little bit?

57:04.234 --> 57:06.702
What do you mean open up
and talk to you?

57:06.737 --> 57:09.205
I'm offering to share
some time with you...

57:09.239 --> 57:11.207
while you're there
checking out these people.

57:11.241 --> 57:14.267
I don't like them there.
I do own the land.

57:14.311 --> 57:18.475
I don't really
want to prefer charges.

57:18.515 --> 57:20.142
They're just kids.

57:20.183 --> 57:24.085
Well, I don't want
to cause them problems...

57:24.121 --> 57:28.581
but with fires and stuff,
and then at night...

57:28.625 --> 57:31.958
the pop cans and everything,
for crying out loud.

57:31.995 --> 57:33.963
How's your pig doing?

57:33.997 --> 57:36.795
- Pardon?
- How's your pig?

57:36.833 --> 57:38.425
He's fine.

57:38.468 --> 57:41.437
He still living in
that old pickup truck?

57:41.471 --> 57:43.939
Yes, he is.

57:43.974 --> 57:46.442
He's a good guy, that pig.

57:46.476 --> 57:49.468
Want to come to play with him?

57:50.680 --> 57:53.171
That's an awfully
nice color on you.

57:53.216 --> 57:55.116
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

57:55.152 --> 57:56.642
Did you, uh...

57:58.789 --> 58:00.256
You missed a spot.

58:00.290 --> 58:01.757
That's just...

58:01.792 --> 58:05.250
Well, you missed a whole spot.
The whole fender.

58:05.295 --> 58:09.254
I'll take care of them hippies.
Don't you worry about that.

58:09.299 --> 58:11.267
You need a lift anywhere?

58:11.301 --> 58:12.768
To my house.

58:12.803 --> 58:14.771
To your house. Just get in.

58:14.805 --> 58:16.796
In front or back?

58:21.812 --> 58:23.837
Can you squeeze in there?

58:36.827 --> 58:38.658
Adios, Mrs. Roberts.

58:38.695 --> 58:39.992
What do you say?

58:40.030 --> 58:41.964
I don't speak no Mexican.

58:41.998 --> 58:48.062
Good-bye, and please give
for me prayers to Mr. Roberts.

58:48.104 --> 58:50.595
Thank you, Lucy, I will.

58:50.640 --> 58:53.541
Work on your past tense.

58:53.577 --> 58:56.273
Lucy, George Washington.

59:08.825 --> 59:11.055
Glow in the dark.

59:33.950 --> 59:36.043
Are you Joe Roberts' wife?

59:36.086 --> 59:38.577
Yes. Who are you?

59:38.622 --> 59:40.590
Me?

59:40.624 --> 59:43.092
I'm Dorothy.

01:00:18.795 --> 01:00:20.422
You in there, Frank?

01:00:49.492 --> 01:00:51.756
It's me... Joe.

01:00:54.164 --> 01:00:56.359
You in there, kid?

01:00:56.399 --> 01:00:58.765
That you, Joe?

01:00:58.802 --> 01:01:00.531
It's me, kid.

01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:05.906
What are you doing in there?

01:01:05.942 --> 01:01:10.436
Working on my draw.

01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:13.347
All right if I come in?

01:01:13.383 --> 01:01:15.783
Sure, Joe, come on in.

01:01:28.231 --> 01:01:30.722
Bang. Gotcha.

01:01:34.604 --> 01:01:38.404
So I had a bit to drink.

01:01:41.077 --> 01:01:44.376
Somebody was boring me.

01:01:44.414 --> 01:01:46.974
Think it was me.

01:02:11.941 --> 01:02:14.239
You want to get dressed, Frank?

01:02:16.079 --> 01:02:18.240
Take you to see your lady.

01:02:36.666 --> 01:02:41.330
Pass me my drawers, would you?

01:02:51.848 --> 01:02:54.783
I just hope he's OK.
Sometimes he hurts himself.

01:02:54.818 --> 01:02:57.810
No, he'll be fine.
Joe'll bring him home.

01:03:01.291 --> 01:03:04.749
So where did you and Frank meet?

01:03:04.794 --> 01:03:06.159
Shoot.

01:03:06.196 --> 01:03:08.664
Everywhere, I guess.

01:03:22.745 --> 01:03:24.474
Excuse me.

01:03:54.577 --> 01:03:57.045
Do you have a six?

01:03:59.983 --> 01:04:01.917
Go fish.

01:04:04.087 --> 01:04:06.521
I got what I asked for.

01:04:10.727 --> 01:04:12.752
Do you have a nine?

01:04:15.465 --> 01:04:16.898
Go fish.

01:04:23.473 --> 01:04:25.134
Welcome back.

01:04:27.410 --> 01:04:28.877
I'm sorry.

01:04:46.296 --> 01:04:50.164
Feel sort of funny
showing up like that.

01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:53.226
I don't know.
I'm glad you're here.

01:04:54.938 --> 01:04:56.929
And Dorothy, too.

01:04:58.541 --> 01:05:00.065
Finally got lucky, huh?

01:05:01.477 --> 01:05:05.106
I sure hope so, because...

01:05:08.218 --> 01:05:11.187
she's got my little monkey
in her belly.

01:05:11.221 --> 01:05:14.122
You're going to be a pop?

01:05:14.157 --> 01:05:15.488
Joe, Dorothy's pregnant.

01:05:15.525 --> 01:05:17.925
I know. So I just heard.

01:05:21.030 --> 01:05:23.658
Come here, Slappy.

01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:28.160
I knew that Frank had come back
as a result of Dad's suicide.

01:05:28.204 --> 01:05:30.434
It was an unsettling thought...

01:05:30.473 --> 01:05:33.203
but that he'd come back
at all...

01:05:33.243 --> 01:05:34.710
Help me with this shit!

01:05:34.744 --> 01:05:38.236
And that he was going to
have a baby with his girl...

01:05:38.281 --> 01:05:42.115
was enough for me to feel that
he'd not gone completely numb.

01:05:52.328 --> 01:05:54.296
What am I, black?

01:06:01.137 --> 01:06:03.002
Messy.

01:06:04.007 --> 01:06:05.634
What are you doing?

01:06:05.675 --> 01:06:10.135
This is where you
used to be a little boy.

01:06:10.179 --> 01:06:12.841
It's where I grew up.

01:06:12.882 --> 01:06:15.646
We're going to be
in the big room, girl.

01:06:15.685 --> 01:06:19.416
I know.
I just want to smell it.

01:06:23.793 --> 01:06:25.260
Sorry.

01:06:26.963 --> 01:06:29.659
I love you more than anybody
ever loved anybody before...

01:06:29.699 --> 01:06:31.257
in the whole wide world.

01:06:35.271 --> 01:06:37.296
Come on, Franky.

01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:40.776
It's our first night
alone together in a big house.

01:06:45.615 --> 01:06:48.413
I love you back, OK?

01:07:32.795 --> 01:07:35.764
Honey, I got to go.

01:07:35.798 --> 01:07:38.266
I told Joe
I'd meet him at 11:00.

01:07:38.301 --> 01:07:41.759
I'm late.
You're a beauty.

01:07:46.342 --> 01:07:48.071
What?

01:07:51.314 --> 01:07:54.010
If you see a shooting star...

01:07:54.050 --> 01:07:59.249
or if you see
anything else...

01:07:59.288 --> 01:08:00.949
will you think of me?

01:08:02.392 --> 01:08:06.089
Little sister, you really
asking me those questions...

01:08:06.129 --> 01:08:09.462
or are you just
stalling me here?

01:08:09.499 --> 01:08:11.296
Both.

01:08:15.838 --> 01:08:17.897
I'll be back soon.

01:08:26.749 --> 01:08:29.183
Used to be bears out here.

01:08:29.218 --> 01:08:32.881
Not so damn long ago.

01:08:34.823 --> 01:08:38.089
This place wasn't even
timbered when we were kids.

01:08:38.127 --> 01:08:39.787
New ground.

01:08:43.633 --> 01:08:45.897
New ground, shit.

01:08:45.935 --> 01:08:47.630
New ground.

01:08:52.642 --> 01:08:54.542
Not new ground.

01:08:54.577 --> 01:08:56.568
What do you mean,
not new ground?

01:09:00.917 --> 01:09:02.475
Old ground!

01:09:02.518 --> 01:09:04.349
Old ground, shit.

01:09:04.386 --> 01:09:07.117
Old ground. Dad said.

01:09:07.156 --> 01:09:10.250
Said what?
What did Dad say?

01:09:10.292 --> 01:09:13.558
You had a Sioux village
twenty-five miles north.

01:09:13.595 --> 01:09:16.997
You had another
ten miles southwest.

01:09:17.033 --> 01:09:20.002
He said,
when this was all woods...

01:09:20.036 --> 01:09:25.564
you had Indian runners traveling
messages right through here.

01:09:25.608 --> 01:09:27.404
Getting chewed by wolves.

01:09:27.443 --> 01:09:28.933
Safe from wolves!

01:09:28.978 --> 01:09:31.707
Shredded by grizzlies.

01:09:31.747 --> 01:09:33.145
Safe from grizzlies.

01:09:33.182 --> 01:09:35.742
Safe, shit.

01:09:39.689 --> 01:09:43.055
Safe, Dad said.

01:09:44.594 --> 01:09:46.220
Said what?

01:09:46.261 --> 01:09:51.859
"Independent of time and space,
the Runner becomes his message."

01:09:51.901 --> 01:09:55.268
Ain't no wolf, no bear
going to eat a message, Joe.

01:09:55.304 --> 01:09:56.771
Never fucking happen.

01:09:56.806 --> 01:09:58.797
Since when do you...

01:10:06.115 --> 01:10:07.605
Wait a minute.

01:10:09.452 --> 01:10:11.977
I get it.

01:10:20.162 --> 01:10:22.892
I know you think that way.

01:10:22.932 --> 01:10:24.126
What way?

01:10:29.939 --> 01:10:31.907
I still love you.

01:10:33.943 --> 01:10:37.470
Dad finally did something
you respect.

01:11:02.438 --> 01:11:06.238
Hey, Pop should have been
an Indian Runner.

01:11:11.347 --> 01:11:14.373
This place looked better
when I had it.

01:11:16.752 --> 01:11:21.280
I'll bet it did.
You know why?

01:11:21.324 --> 01:11:23.849
Because you had the fire in you.

01:11:23.893 --> 01:11:26.885
People got it now don't live
on the land they're working.

01:11:26.929 --> 01:11:30.126
Ain't got no fire.
Never had it.

01:11:31.601 --> 01:11:33.159
This fire?

01:11:33.202 --> 01:11:36.660
The fire's out now.
So what?

01:11:36.706 --> 01:11:40.164
Between the cradle and now,
you happened.

01:11:40.209 --> 01:11:42.609
You burned, brother.

01:11:47.817 --> 01:11:50.285
What do I have to show for it?

01:11:50.319 --> 01:11:57.521
What you got, Farmer Joe,
is knowing you once was.

01:11:57.560 --> 01:11:59.585
On fire.

01:12:02.365 --> 01:12:04.560
Shit.

01:12:07.370 --> 01:12:08.837
Man...

01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:12.771
I burned.

01:12:12.808 --> 01:12:15.038
The land was churned.

01:12:15.077 --> 01:12:17.238
- I burned.
- The soil was turned.

01:12:17.279 --> 01:12:19.747
- I burned.
- They took what you earned.

01:12:19.782 --> 01:12:21.909
A lesson learned.

01:12:24.086 --> 01:12:26.111
Meeting adjourned.

01:12:39.001 --> 01:12:41.333
I've missed this, Franky.

01:12:43.773 --> 01:12:46.333
I've missed having
a laugh with you.

01:12:46.375 --> 01:12:48.434
Me, too.

01:12:54.617 --> 01:12:59.145
Oh, man...
what'd you do that for?

01:12:59.188 --> 01:13:01.247
Come on.

01:13:03.693 --> 01:13:06.719
OK, Big Bear.

01:13:06.762 --> 01:13:09.822
I'm an Indian Runner.
I'm a message.

01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:14.526
And the message is...

01:13:14.570 --> 01:13:16.970
bet you can't find me.

01:13:20.609 --> 01:13:22.236
I'll get you.

01:14:09.191 --> 01:14:11.318
Ready to give up?

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:13.294
God damn it.

01:14:31.814 --> 01:14:33.441
All right!

01:14:35.217 --> 01:14:37.117
All right, you win!

01:14:37.153 --> 01:14:41.385
You're a message.
You win.

01:14:44.894 --> 01:14:47.192
Oh, Joseph.

01:14:47.229 --> 01:14:48.753
Oh, Joey.

01:15:02.711 --> 01:15:05.077
The message is...

01:15:06.649 --> 01:15:08.048
never trust a bear.

01:15:09.585 --> 01:15:12.076
I thought you're a tough guy.

01:16:39.308 --> 01:16:44.109
Frank worked hard,
every shift he could get on.

01:16:44.146 --> 01:16:46.137
And Dorothy
tended to the house...

01:16:46.181 --> 01:16:50.709
got the old place
looking remarkably new.

01:16:50.753 --> 01:16:52.584
Me...

01:16:55.057 --> 01:16:57.787
I wanted to burn again.

01:17:59.054 --> 01:18:02.217
How much longer
do I have to do this, Franky?

01:18:02.257 --> 01:18:03.224
Forty seconds.

01:18:03.258 --> 01:18:07.285
I don't think
this is good for the baby.

01:18:08.297 --> 01:18:10.424
Thirty-five seconds.

01:18:13.502 --> 01:18:16.266
Why do I have to do this?

01:18:17.339 --> 01:18:19.534
Because I got to know.
Twenty-five seconds.

01:18:19.575 --> 01:18:21.634
Got to know what?

01:18:21.677 --> 01:18:23.474
Twenty.

01:18:27.616 --> 01:18:34.385
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...

01:18:34.423 --> 01:18:40.123
five, four, three, two, one.

01:18:41.163 --> 01:18:43.097
Good.

01:18:44.199 --> 01:18:47.259
I'll marry you... if you want.

01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:50.768
Did you say you'd marry me?

01:18:50.806 --> 01:18:52.364
If you want.

01:18:55.778 --> 01:18:58.110
Oh, my God!
I'm going to be your wife!

01:18:58.147 --> 01:19:00.411
Go!

01:19:19.234 --> 01:19:20.929
Go, Franky, go!

01:21:51.119 --> 01:21:53.246
Good, little sister.

01:21:57.559 --> 01:21:58.856
It's kicking!

01:21:58.894 --> 01:22:01.761
Franky, it's kicking.

01:22:02.898 --> 01:22:04.263
Let me see.

01:22:06.501 --> 01:22:07.763
There?

01:22:10.639 --> 01:22:13.107
That ain't a kick,
that's a punch.

01:22:13.141 --> 01:22:15.609
That's the last wild son
you're baking, baby.

01:22:15.644 --> 01:22:18.112
Is that right,
what your papa said?

01:22:18.146 --> 01:22:20.341
You going to be
a big, strong, handsome dude?

01:22:21.650 --> 01:22:23.117
What about me?

01:22:23.151 --> 01:22:27.053
I got some skeeter bites
that need scratching.

01:22:27.089 --> 01:22:31.116
How about you and me
go fiddle with the hydraulics?

01:22:31.159 --> 01:22:35.687
Frank, don't talk like that!

01:22:50.712 --> 01:22:53.112
Why are you looking
at me like that?

01:22:57.219 --> 01:23:00.746
Come on, Franky,
you're scaring me.

01:23:25.314 --> 01:23:27.782
Frank, you're scaring me.

01:23:30.719 --> 01:23:33.187
Did I say the wrong thing?

01:23:34.356 --> 01:23:36.756
Is it that you don't know me...

01:23:36.792 --> 01:23:39.420
you don't know when
I say something nice?

01:23:39.461 --> 01:23:40.723
Don't.

01:23:40.762 --> 01:23:44.391
You don't know how to see
good things from bad things?

01:23:44.433 --> 01:23:45.730
That it?

01:23:47.269 --> 01:23:49.897
Is it that we're strangers?

01:23:58.747 --> 01:24:00.408
We're not strangers.

01:24:00.449 --> 01:24:02.815
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:24:04.252 --> 01:24:05.549
Let's eat.

01:24:06.755 --> 01:24:08.882
You eat.

01:24:10.359 --> 01:24:12.259
You eat.

01:24:22.137 --> 01:24:23.798
Stop it.

01:24:32.914 --> 01:24:35.212
Wait. Where are you going?

01:24:40.956 --> 01:24:43.390
It's OK, baby.

01:24:44.926 --> 01:24:47.724
He's just restless, that's all.

01:24:47.763 --> 01:24:49.788
Put your hands on him...

01:24:49.831 --> 01:24:52.595
and you can't bring
any charges against him.

01:24:52.634 --> 01:24:54.101
You weren't here.
You didn't see what he did.

01:24:54.136 --> 01:24:56.104
He blind-sided me, man!

01:24:56.138 --> 01:24:57.605
Listen to me.

01:24:57.639 --> 01:24:59.266
Get in there!

01:24:59.307 --> 01:25:01.775
No, you're not going
to get in there!

01:25:01.810 --> 01:25:04.404
I'll run you in, man.

01:25:06.548 --> 01:25:09.608
Damn it, he blind-sided me!

01:25:09.651 --> 01:25:12.119
We tried to get you at home.

01:25:12.154 --> 01:25:14.122
Maria said she didn't know
where you were.

01:25:14.156 --> 01:25:16.124
Inside. It's Frank.

01:25:16.158 --> 01:25:18.626
He busted this guy up
pretty good.

01:25:18.660 --> 01:25:20.628
The guy's talking
about pressing charges.

01:25:20.662 --> 01:25:22.653
Settle down. Take it easy.

01:25:23.698 --> 01:25:25.325
Keep him there, Jim.

01:25:26.668 --> 01:25:28.135
Where is he?

01:25:28.170 --> 01:25:29.637
He's in there, boss.

01:25:29.671 --> 01:25:32.663
I had to handcuff him
to the bar rail.

01:25:44.553 --> 01:25:46.748
Looks like he ran up
a tab tonight, huh, Caesar?

01:25:46.788 --> 01:25:50.121
He did that.

01:25:50.158 --> 01:25:52.626
He tells me
he can sell some furniture.

01:25:52.661 --> 01:25:54.754
Can you give us a minute,
Caesar?

01:26:06.808 --> 01:26:10.835
Is that right, Frank?
You can sell some furniture?

01:26:11.847 --> 01:26:13.314
That's good.

01:26:13.348 --> 01:26:18.547
You blow off some steam,
Dorothy's got nothing to sit on.

01:26:18.587 --> 01:26:22.216
What are you going to sell off
to keep this fella...

01:26:22.257 --> 01:26:25.488
with the big eye from
pressing charges against you?

01:26:25.527 --> 01:26:28.155
With your record,
you could do a year on this.

01:26:28.196 --> 01:26:30.664
What can I say?
I fucked up.

01:26:30.699 --> 01:26:33.998
I get in a violent way,
look around a room...

01:26:34.035 --> 01:26:35.832
I want to bust it all to hell.

01:26:35.871 --> 01:26:37.805
I see a guy like that...

01:26:37.839 --> 01:26:39.739
I don't want him
to look at me cross-eyed.

01:26:39.774 --> 01:26:42.299
I want that excuse
to fucking do him.

01:26:42.344 --> 01:26:45.336
So you spend your life in jail?

01:26:46.748 --> 01:26:49.546
That's a bear, man.

01:26:49.584 --> 01:26:51.552
I'm a message!

01:26:56.958 --> 01:26:59.722
Jail can't touch me.

01:27:04.699 --> 01:27:06.894
Give me a cigarette.

01:27:15.710 --> 01:27:17.940
I thought you were done
with this shit.

01:27:17.979 --> 01:27:19.537
Well...

01:27:19.581 --> 01:27:23.017
What about Dorothy? The baby?
Can it touch them?

01:27:23.051 --> 01:27:25.212
- Outside parties.
- What?

01:27:25.253 --> 01:27:29.087
Outside parties.
Give me a light.

01:27:29.124 --> 01:27:32.651
I'm tired.
I just want to sit here, OK?

01:27:32.694 --> 01:27:35.629
I'll sit here. I'll relax.

01:27:35.664 --> 01:27:39.566
- You got something...
- Wait a minute, Clyde!

01:27:39.601 --> 01:27:42.593
- Let me get in there!
- Listen to me.

01:27:46.274 --> 01:27:50.301
Boy, I've had some
western times in this joint.

01:27:50.345 --> 01:27:54.111
Frank, you got a job.

01:27:55.617 --> 01:27:57.016
Oh, yeah.

01:27:57.052 --> 01:27:59.987
You got a great girl.

01:28:00.021 --> 01:28:01.921
You have a baby coming.

01:28:09.097 --> 01:28:11.759
Give me your free hand.

01:28:14.035 --> 01:28:16.128
Frank, give me your hand.

01:28:20.108 --> 01:28:23.771
What are you doing?

01:28:23.812 --> 01:28:27.304
I'm going to cut you a break.

01:28:33.655 --> 01:28:35.054
Yeah, boss?

01:28:35.090 --> 01:28:37.115
Bring that fella in here.

01:28:37.158 --> 01:28:40.753
He's just going to jump
all over Frank.

01:28:40.795 --> 01:28:42.592
I know.

01:29:07.055 --> 01:29:08.522
You're bleeding.

01:29:08.556 --> 01:29:11.184
Goddamn rocket scientist,
I tell you.

01:29:17.565 --> 01:29:19.226
I'm going to go, Frank.

01:29:21.503 --> 01:29:23.733
Be sure he comes by
to see me tomorrow.

01:29:23.772 --> 01:29:25.763
I'll hold on to
the car keys till then.

01:29:25.807 --> 01:29:27.172
All right.

01:29:28.309 --> 01:29:30.641
Good night.

01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:33.470
Good night, Joe.

01:29:39.721 --> 01:29:41.450
What happened?

01:29:46.494 --> 01:29:47.859
Ask Joe.

01:30:18.226 --> 01:30:20.820
Joe, you've done
everything you can.

01:30:21.830 --> 01:30:23.354
I know.

01:30:26.401 --> 01:30:27.891
I know.

01:30:35.477 --> 01:30:37.468
I look at him...

01:30:42.016 --> 01:30:44.484
and I see this little boy...

01:30:46.688 --> 01:30:49.680
with his little toy gunbelt on.

01:30:56.464 --> 01:30:58.455
My little brother.

01:31:01.603 --> 01:31:03.468
He's not
a little boy anymore.

01:31:03.505 --> 01:31:05.063
He's got a problem.

01:31:05.106 --> 01:31:07.233
He has to deal with it.

01:31:32.867 --> 01:31:34.334
Dotty?

01:31:39.741 --> 01:31:41.174
Dotty!

01:31:43.378 --> 01:31:44.675
Yeah, Franky?

01:31:44.712 --> 01:31:46.577
Come here.

01:31:57.058 --> 01:32:00.221
I guess I got
a little off course last night.

01:32:00.261 --> 01:32:01.660
I know.

01:32:04.799 --> 01:32:06.630
I love you, little sister.

01:32:09.037 --> 01:32:10.504
I know.

01:33:31.019 --> 01:33:33.510
Look who I caught in
the parking lot doing wheelies.

01:33:44.632 --> 01:33:46.896
I came to get the car...

01:33:46.935 --> 01:33:49.927
but if you got a minute,
I'd like to talk to you.

01:33:49.971 --> 01:33:51.063
Sure.

01:33:52.907 --> 01:33:54.306
Can you follow?

01:33:54.342 --> 01:33:57.106
- Drop Frank's car at his place?
- Sure, boss.

01:33:59.247 --> 01:34:01.238
You ride with me.

01:34:05.019 --> 01:34:07.715
- Randall?
- Yeah, boss?

01:34:07.755 --> 01:34:09.245
Where's your gun?

01:34:18.399 --> 01:34:20.094
There it is.

01:34:24.973 --> 01:34:26.873
Damn it!
That ain't funny, Frank.

01:34:48.963 --> 01:34:51.193
I know you're worried about...

01:34:52.633 --> 01:34:55.431
will I take care of business...

01:34:55.470 --> 01:34:58.098
with the old lady...

01:34:58.139 --> 01:35:00.573
when the baby comes.

01:35:02.777 --> 01:35:04.267
I appreciate it.

01:35:10.418 --> 01:35:13.581
But I don't want you
to worry about me no more.

01:35:14.922 --> 01:35:16.913
I'm good, Joe.

01:35:18.593 --> 01:35:20.026
I'm good.

01:35:22.964 --> 01:35:25.125
I want you to have
a good life, Frank.

01:35:30.872 --> 01:35:32.362
I know.

01:35:34.575 --> 01:35:36.668
I guess...

01:35:36.711 --> 01:35:41.239
I guess what I'm here
to say is that...

01:35:45.386 --> 01:35:47.877
I'm sorry about all the shit.

01:35:49.390 --> 01:35:52.018
I'm sorry about Mom...

01:35:54.395 --> 01:35:55.885
and Pop.

01:35:57.632 --> 01:36:03.901
And, you know,
I ain't said it, so...

01:36:07.408 --> 01:36:09.376
I'm saying it.

01:36:24.392 --> 01:36:27.919
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Joe.

01:39:20.568 --> 01:39:22.536
- Have.
- I have.

01:39:22.570 --> 01:39:23.537
Have.

01:39:23.571 --> 01:39:24.970
My pen.

01:39:25.006 --> 01:39:26.530
She.

01:39:28.643 --> 01:39:32.101
- Had?
- Has.

01:39:32.146 --> 01:39:35.604
Has. Telephone!

01:39:35.650 --> 01:39:37.845
Her.

01:39:37.885 --> 01:39:40.012
She has...

01:39:44.158 --> 01:39:45.648
Joe Roberts.

01:39:47.161 --> 01:39:49.061
What is it, Frank?

01:39:51.732 --> 01:39:53.723
We'll be right there.

01:40:00.041 --> 01:40:02.032
The baby's coming.

01:40:17.692 --> 01:40:21.753
The baby was come.

01:40:21.796 --> 01:40:23.991
Present.

01:40:24.031 --> 01:40:26.932
I'm checking
the baby's head now...

01:40:26.967 --> 01:40:31.370
and the back of the baby
is right over here.

01:40:37.645 --> 01:40:40.239
The baby's coming.

01:40:56.364 --> 01:40:58.355
We'll see if there's a horsy.

01:41:02.336 --> 01:41:04.827
We'll see if there's a horsy.

01:41:15.983 --> 01:41:18.008
It's all right.
I'll be right back.

01:41:36.337 --> 01:41:38.305
Would you ask the doctor
where Frank went?

01:41:38.339 --> 01:41:40.534
I just saw him drive off.

01:41:52.553 --> 01:41:55.647
He said he left the room
just to let us in.

01:41:59.226 --> 01:42:01.217
I'm going to go find him.

01:42:16.677 --> 01:42:19.703
Did you ever
want to kill someone...

01:42:19.747 --> 01:42:21.738
just out of rage...

01:42:24.118 --> 01:42:28.953
and you don't do it
because you're afraid?

01:42:29.957 --> 01:42:31.754
And it's all about fear.

01:42:34.195 --> 01:42:37.187
Fear of the law
coming down, sure...

01:42:39.700 --> 01:42:41.292
but mostly...

01:42:44.205 --> 01:42:46.469
fear like in sin...

01:42:49.710 --> 01:42:51.473
sin with God.

01:42:54.849 --> 01:42:57.716
Yeah, Almighty God.

01:43:00.087 --> 01:43:03.955
What if he ain't almighty?
What if he ain't sacred?

01:43:03.991 --> 01:43:08.223
You might just as well
have done the fella, right?

01:43:11.899 --> 01:43:14.390
Goodness...

01:43:14.435 --> 01:43:17.529
maybe ain't nothing but fear.

01:43:17.571 --> 01:43:19.232
You know?

01:43:30.985 --> 01:43:32.475
What you doing here?

01:43:34.388 --> 01:43:35.878
Looking for you.

01:43:35.923 --> 01:43:37.982
You found me.

01:43:40.694 --> 01:43:42.685
What are you doing here?

01:43:42.730 --> 01:43:45.597
I'm having a drink.
Buy you one?

01:43:46.901 --> 01:43:50.064
Don't you think you ought to be
by your lady's side?

01:43:53.574 --> 01:43:56.134
Leastways, over at the house?

01:43:56.176 --> 01:43:58.144
The house.

01:44:03.284 --> 01:44:04.478
Why not?

01:44:04.518 --> 01:44:06.076
Why?

01:44:12.826 --> 01:44:15.761
Come on, Frank,
don't give me that horseshit!

01:44:15.796 --> 01:44:18.094
How are you, Joe?

01:44:20.367 --> 01:44:22.267
Afternoon, Caesar.

01:44:22.303 --> 01:44:24.737
You boys watch the place
for a minute?

01:44:24.772 --> 01:44:28.708
I got to go pay a visit
to the captain's chair.

01:44:35.249 --> 01:44:36.739
Chickenshit.

01:44:38.786 --> 01:44:40.447
Chickenshit.

01:44:44.525 --> 01:44:47.494
I'm trying to understand
why you are...

01:44:47.528 --> 01:44:50.520
such a selfish son of a bitch.

01:44:53.834 --> 01:44:56.325
I want to know how
to help you, Frank.

01:44:58.138 --> 01:45:00.800
You're my brother.

01:45:00.841 --> 01:45:02.968
You're the angriest man I know.

01:45:03.010 --> 01:45:04.875
I want to know
why you hurt people...

01:45:04.912 --> 01:45:07.278
why you're not with Dorothy
when your baby's being born.

01:45:07.314 --> 01:45:09.282
Let me ask you something.

01:45:09.316 --> 01:45:12.285
How'd it feel
when you killed that fella...

01:45:12.319 --> 01:45:15.311
that kid out on the highway?

01:45:17.858 --> 01:45:19.155
Not good, Frank.

01:45:19.193 --> 01:45:23.653
No? I would have thought
that felt real fucking good.

01:45:23.697 --> 01:45:26.097
It was clean. It was legal.

01:45:26.133 --> 01:45:28.567
You saved your own life.

01:45:28.602 --> 01:45:30.661
I mean, that's common sense.

01:45:30.704 --> 01:45:33.901
It's common fucking sense,
right?

01:45:33.941 --> 01:45:36.102
It's how these people think.

01:45:36.143 --> 01:45:38.270
What people?

01:45:38.312 --> 01:45:39.336
What people?

01:45:39.380 --> 01:45:41.348
Man, you're on
a fucking tangent.

01:45:41.382 --> 01:45:43.282
I ain't on a fucking tangent!

01:45:43.317 --> 01:45:46.150
These fuckers don't give you
time to figure out the problem.

01:45:46.186 --> 01:45:49.587
It's a math class.
The whole deal.

01:45:49.623 --> 01:45:53.582
Just like every math class,
there's a clown in the front...

01:45:53.627 --> 01:45:57.859
and everybody hates this clown
because he raises his hand.

01:45:57.898 --> 01:45:59.422
He's answering
all the questions.

01:45:59.466 --> 01:46:01.957
What do we do? Move on.

01:46:02.002 --> 01:46:06.462
Just fucking move on,
ready or not.

01:46:06.507 --> 01:46:12.241
He's deciding
we got to move on.

01:46:13.781 --> 01:46:15.715
He knows his math.

01:46:17.217 --> 01:46:22.314
I hadn't even figured out
about Santa Claus yet, dragons.

01:46:22.356 --> 01:46:24.722
Gasoline was my favorite smell.

01:46:26.660 --> 01:46:29.686
It's like your farm.

01:46:29.730 --> 01:46:32.824
Who grew better crops,
you or the math man...

01:46:32.866 --> 01:46:35.300
who bought it
out from under you? You!

01:46:35.335 --> 01:46:38.862
What's a farm for?
It's for crops.

01:46:40.140 --> 01:46:42.199
That's the world, Joe...

01:46:44.011 --> 01:46:45.808
and it's a beauty.

01:46:45.846 --> 01:46:47.541
Am I right?

01:46:52.886 --> 01:46:54.217
You're right.

01:46:54.254 --> 01:46:56.415
Am I wrong?

01:46:56.457 --> 01:47:00.484
There is no common sense.
Right? I'm right.

01:47:05.232 --> 01:47:07.564
All right.

01:47:07.601 --> 01:47:08.898
All right.

01:47:08.936 --> 01:47:10.563
So you're angry.

01:47:10.604 --> 01:47:12.196
All your problems
are the world's fault.

01:47:12.239 --> 01:47:15.402
That's right.
It's the world's fault.

01:47:15.442 --> 01:47:17.910
Your fault. My fault.

01:47:17.945 --> 01:47:22.109
The fault of every
motherfucking human being...

01:47:22.149 --> 01:47:24.982
every fucking one
of them out there.

01:47:28.522 --> 01:47:30.513
Life lacks tenderness, does it?

01:47:36.764 --> 01:47:38.755
Go on back there.

01:47:41.034 --> 01:47:43.935
Go see my angel get born.

01:47:46.540 --> 01:47:51.307
Life must be great
if you laugh it up.

01:47:53.514 --> 01:47:55.675
No, mister...

01:47:57.050 --> 01:48:00.042
I'll just stay here
and drink it down...

01:48:03.123 --> 01:48:07.924
because there's only
two kinds of men in this hell.

01:48:07.961 --> 01:48:10.555
There's heroes and outlaws.

01:48:11.665 --> 01:48:14.793
Which one are you?

01:48:30.083 --> 01:48:33.052
Men come strong or weak,
and you ain't strong.

01:48:33.086 --> 01:48:36.419
You're in a bar when
Dorothy needs you the most...

01:48:36.456 --> 01:48:38.253
so you go ahead, Frank.

01:48:38.292 --> 01:48:40.692
You go ahead. Drink it down.

01:48:40.727 --> 01:48:43.252
You got it right.
There ain't nothing.

01:48:43.297 --> 01:48:46.289
Ain't nothing worthwhile left,
not even our own children.

01:48:49.736 --> 01:48:53.172
Your eyes are closed.
Keep them that way.

01:48:53.207 --> 01:48:55.767
My eyes are open, Frank...

01:48:55.809 --> 01:49:00.906
and I love looking at
my little boy and my wife...

01:49:00.948 --> 01:49:03.109
and my house
and my little garden.

01:49:03.150 --> 01:49:05.141
And I love you, Frank.

01:49:08.722 --> 01:49:10.747
That all there is?

01:49:14.027 --> 01:49:16.359
Why does that scare you so much?

01:49:16.396 --> 01:49:18.694
Why doesn't it scare you?

01:49:18.732 --> 01:49:20.825
Why?

01:49:20.868 --> 01:49:24.463
I'm fixing a bridge
for fat retired men...

01:49:24.504 --> 01:49:27.598
and their fat wives
and fat fucking little kids...

01:49:27.641 --> 01:49:32.442
to drive over it
in their motor homes.

01:49:34.114 --> 01:49:38.210
I'm making an impact.
That's what I'm doing.

01:50:05.746 --> 01:50:08.078
That's all there is, Frank.

01:50:11.184 --> 01:50:13.175
Out there it's family.

01:50:19.459 --> 01:50:21.290
In here it's hell.

01:50:56.330 --> 01:50:57.797
I'll be right back.

01:50:57.831 --> 01:51:00.527
I'm here.
I'll be right back.

01:51:06.640 --> 01:51:09.609
- What happened?
- It's nothing.

01:51:09.643 --> 01:51:11.042
She all right?

01:51:11.078 --> 01:51:12.545
She's tough.
Where's Frank?

01:51:12.579 --> 01:51:14.547
- Not here.
- Where?

01:52:21.314 --> 01:52:23.805
God! No!

01:52:23.850 --> 01:52:25.249
Breathe!

01:52:25.285 --> 01:52:27.253
You're doing beautifully.

01:52:27.287 --> 01:52:29.721
- You're doing great.
- Almost there.

01:53:39.593 --> 01:53:43.222
Oh, God! Help me!

01:55:02.409 --> 01:55:04.468
Where's Franky?

01:55:29.135 --> 01:55:30.625
What?

01:56:36.703 --> 01:56:39.467
Take a deep breath
and blow it away.

01:56:46.413 --> 01:56:48.472
Keep pushing.

01:56:49.949 --> 01:56:51.541
It's just about here.

01:57:19.479 --> 01:57:22.141
This is Unit Three.
I got him.

01:57:46.740 --> 01:57:49.504
The baby's coming.

01:57:49.542 --> 01:57:51.567
He's coming.

01:57:51.611 --> 01:57:54.444
The head is being delivered.

01:58:09.662 --> 01:58:11.493
Stop!

01:58:30.116 --> 01:58:32.107
Can you see it?

01:58:35.121 --> 01:58:36.713
Oh, God.

01:59:32.378 --> 01:59:36.041
Here we come out,
and it's a boy.

01:59:43.022 --> 01:59:44.922
A healthy boy,
it looks like.

02:01:36.102 --> 02:01:39.435
I knew I'd never see or hear
from Franky again.

02:01:40.940 --> 02:01:43.568
He turned his back...

02:01:43.610 --> 02:01:45.737
on himself...

02:01:45.778 --> 02:01:47.370
and on his family.

02:01:52.118 --> 02:01:54.109
I went home that night...

02:01:55.321 --> 02:01:56.982
watered my garden...

02:01:58.224 --> 02:02:00.055
kissed my baby...

02:02:00.093 --> 02:02:02.721
and I held my wife
until morning.

02:02:04.697 --> 02:02:06.255
Life is good...

02:02:08.835 --> 02:02:10.598
my brother Frank.
