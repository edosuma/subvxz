00:01.720 --> 00:03.051
<i>Previously on Manhattan...</i>

00:03.120 --> 00:04.485
You're building an atomic bomb.

00:04.560 --> 00:06.369
What I would like
is my share of the plutonium.

00:06.440 --> 00:09.410
If Frank could prove that implosion
was more than a fairy tale,

00:09.480 --> 00:11.881
-I'd give him all the plutonium he wants.
-Fine.

00:11.960 --> 00:13.246
I don't feel bad for you.

00:13.320 --> 00:17.041
I feel bad for those suckers in your group
that you're taking down with you.

00:17.160 --> 00:18.241
Get home safe.

00:18.360 --> 00:20.328
I don't know what's gotten into him
since we got here.

00:20.400 --> 00:22.562
<i>Half the time he's brooding
and the other half...</i>

00:22.640 --> 00:25.484
<i>He can't keep his hands to himself.</i>

00:25.560 --> 00:27.369
You got to help me, Frank.
Please, I'm not a spy.

00:27.440 --> 00:28.885
Sid Liao is not a traitor.

00:28.960 --> 00:31.531
Forty eight hours ago,
our group was on the chopping block.

00:31.600 --> 00:33.125
Now we're back in this office.

00:33.240 --> 00:34.321
You said you would protect Sid.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.323
Your group is intact.
You got what you asked for.

00:36.400 --> 00:38.607
Outside parties have taken an interest
in your man.

00:38.680 --> 00:41.411
Technically, you're nowhere
talking to no one.

00:41.520 --> 00:42.567
I'm not a spy.

00:45.600 --> 00:47.125
The plutonium will remain
with Dr. Akley's group.

00:49.760 --> 00:50.841
He's got my sidearm.

00:50.920 --> 00:53.082
Whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy.

00:53.440 --> 00:54.601
Show me your pass.

00:59.280 --> 01:00.691
What did I do?

02:27.120 --> 02:28.610
Private Dunlavey.

02:32.280 --> 02:33.441
Ready, sir.

02:33.520 --> 02:36.126
Get your trunks. Colonel's been waiting.

02:36.200 --> 02:38.202
I-I didn't know I was supposed to pack.

02:39.280 --> 02:40.930
Am I being discharged?

02:54.280 --> 02:55.884
Swim out to the middle.

02:57.080 --> 02:58.730
I don't swim well. It's...

02:58.800 --> 03:00.802
It's landlocked where I'm from.

03:00.880 --> 03:04.441
Well, then you'll be the first guy
in history to drown in a desert.

03:22.960 --> 03:26.248
Private, I need a full report
of what happened at the gate.

03:27.120 --> 03:28.201
What, here?

03:31.720 --> 03:33.449
It was 1900 hours.

03:34.760 --> 03:37.001
I saw that the driver had a weapon

03:37.920 --> 03:40.400
and I didn't have time to think, sir.

03:41.520 --> 03:44.364
Maybe I could have disarmed him
or shot to wound?

03:44.440 --> 03:47.523
You fired on a civilian, soldier.
I need answers, not questions.

03:47.640 --> 03:50.723
Sir, I was afraid for the safety
of my fellow soldier.

03:53.920 --> 03:55.001
Dunlavey,

03:55.080 --> 03:57.401
you are hereby promoted to the rank of E3

03:57.480 --> 03:59.289
for bravery against enemy attack.

03:59.360 --> 04:03.081
Effective today, you'll work in my office,
reporting directly to me.

04:04.640 --> 04:06.802
I... I don't understand, sir.

04:08.040 --> 04:11.044
Walls in this base are so thin
they don't need ears.

04:11.240 --> 04:14.210
When the rest of the Hill finds out
that you pulled the trigger,

04:14.280 --> 04:16.408
people are gonna come
to you with questions.

04:16.480 --> 04:19.211
- I expect you to tell the truth.
-Yes, sir. Of course.

04:19.320 --> 04:21.607
You ensured the safety of this base.

04:21.680 --> 04:25.048
Sid Liao attempted to abscond
with highly classified materials

04:25.560 --> 04:28.769
which you personally recovered
from under the floor mats.

04:32.320 --> 04:33.401
Sir,

04:34.000 --> 04:35.684
we searched Liao's car.

04:37.320 --> 04:39.322
That's right, Private First Class.

04:39.400 --> 04:40.526
You did.

05:37.520 --> 05:40.091
<i>Attention. Your attention, please.</i>

05:40.160 --> 05:43.607
<i>A secure community
is a productive community.</i>

05:43.680 --> 05:45.967
<i>And we are a community at war.</i>

05:46.040 --> 05:47.963
<i>After the events of this week,</i>

05:48.160 --> 05:52.563
<i>the Army is instituting new directives
of compartmentalization</i>

05:53.200 --> 05:57.808
<i>to ensure the continued security of our work
and of the citizens in our care.</i>

05:59.720 --> 06:01.165
<i>From this day forward,</i>

06:01.240 --> 06:04.005
<i>each worker will have access
to the information required</i>

06:04.080 --> 06:07.004
<i>to carry out his duties and nothing more.</i>

06:07.560 --> 06:10.962
<i>All residents and workers,
regardless of clearance level,</i>

06:11.040 --> 06:13.850
<i>are now subject to random searches.</i>

06:13.920 --> 06:18.130
<i>Socializing with persons outside
of this community is prohibited.</i>

06:19.440 --> 06:24.606
<i>Concerned citizens should report any
suspicious activity to the security office.</i>

06:26.080 --> 06:29.368
<i>These measures will reinforce
the sense of privacy</i>

06:29.760 --> 06:32.445
<i>and peace of mind this community enjoys.</i>

06:33.240 --> 06:35.481
<i>Any failure to adhere to these policies</i>

06:35.600 --> 06:39.286
<i>will be deemed a violation
of the Federal Espionage Act.</i>

06:40.440 --> 06:43.011
<i>Cooperation is appreciated.</i>

07:04.480 --> 07:05.891
Doesn't look like much,

07:05.960 --> 07:08.122
but I suppose bees aren't choosy.

07:08.240 --> 07:09.810
- Ha.
- There's a

07:09.880 --> 07:12.645
swarm over in the cottonwoods by the PX.

07:13.360 --> 07:14.850
Can't you just spray them?

07:15.560 --> 07:19.167
Oh, it's not a trap. It's an artificial hive.
I wanna study them.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.001
Oh.

07:21.680 --> 07:25.321
I've been meaning to drop by
and apologize. I...

07:25.400 --> 07:26.811
About the other night.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.803
Frank's not very good at...

07:29.040 --> 07:30.371
Socializing?

07:32.720 --> 07:35.121
Um, I found this

07:35.640 --> 07:37.005
after our dinner.

07:37.080 --> 07:39.162
Does it belong to your daughter?

07:41.080 --> 07:45.085
It was a present from her aunt.
Where on earth did you find it?

07:46.160 --> 07:48.811
In my dresser drawer, stuck to a brassiere.

07:51.680 --> 07:53.762
Well, Callie will be so grateful.

08:01.520 --> 08:03.488
Wonder who they're gonna murder today.

08:05.520 --> 08:07.648
The whole thing is horrible.

08:08.160 --> 08:10.322
But they say the spy had a gun.

08:11.280 --> 08:14.841
The "spy" was a 26-year-old boy
from Frank's group.

08:16.360 --> 08:17.407
Sorry.

08:28.440 --> 08:29.726
What are we supposed to do with it?

08:31.400 --> 08:33.323
Someone should reach out to Annie.

08:33.559 --> 08:36.245
The Army would approve a call
to Mussolini before Sid Liao's wife.

08:36.320 --> 08:37.559
Well, the Army can approve my dick.

08:38.400 --> 08:39.400
Sorry.

08:40.440 --> 08:42.249
Sid loaned me his toothbrush once.

08:43.240 --> 08:44.241
Really?

08:44.320 --> 08:45.685
That's repulsive.

08:45.760 --> 08:47.524
Someone stole mine.

08:47.640 --> 08:50.450
I'm just saying,
I lived two doors down from the guy.

08:50.520 --> 08:53.364
- How did we not see this coming?
- Because he wasn't a spy.

08:57.200 --> 08:58.326
What's the difference now?

08:58.400 --> 09:00.482
The difference is now this entire
godforsaken group

09:00.600 --> 09:01.806
is gonna have its bunks
tossed every night.

09:01.880 --> 09:04.281
- No, not the guy who sold him out.
-And for the hundredth time, Meeks...

09:04.360 --> 09:06.010
Someone reported him to the Army.

09:06.080 --> 09:08.651
You'd sell yourself out if you thought
it would help your career.

09:08.720 --> 09:11.929
You know what? If I had overturned a spook,
I wouldn't feel one ounce of guilt.

09:16.440 --> 09:19.444
They found stolen files in his car.
The MP told me.

09:24.160 --> 09:26.367
What do you think they did with the body?

09:37.440 --> 09:39.647
Who's covering the spectrum analysis?

09:40.520 --> 09:42.045
That was Sid's project.

09:42.200 --> 09:43.440
Now it's yours.

10:11.040 --> 10:12.166
Who's been in my office?

10:12.240 --> 10:14.402
It was just a catnap
and it was two weeks ago.

10:15.920 --> 10:19.720
The shockwave analysis, X-ray studies,
tamper design, they're all gone.

10:21.480 --> 10:23.323
Those were all Sid's assignments.

10:24.440 --> 10:26.249
Goddamn Army.

10:33.400 --> 10:34.765
I heard he was a commie.

10:34.840 --> 10:37.571
Spy or not, I don't love the idea
of some yahoo at the gate

10:37.680 --> 10:39.364
playing jury and executioner.

10:40.200 --> 10:42.646
From now on we're supposed
to call plutonium "product."

10:42.720 --> 10:45.326
And the code for uranium is "tube alloy."

10:45.400 --> 10:47.926
I gave Martha a little tube alloy last night.

10:49.200 --> 10:52.204
Does the Army have a code for
"I can't hear myself think"?

10:55.720 --> 10:58.166
What say I buy you a sandwich, Charles?

10:58.240 --> 10:59.969
You've worked through lunch
every day this week.

11:00.040 --> 11:01.963
Dr. Akley asked me to calculate

11:02.040 --> 11:04.884
the exact velocity
of every neutron in Thin Man.

11:05.720 --> 11:08.121
Diffusion alone could take a month.

11:08.800 --> 11:11.770
You know, Reed Akley
was my graduate advisor at Chicago.

11:11.880 --> 11:14.087
Start of the semester,
he handed me a problem to work on,

11:14.160 --> 11:18.051
and after a week with no sleep, I realized
it was basically Fermat's last theorem.

11:18.120 --> 11:19.610
Completely unsolvable.

11:19.680 --> 11:21.364
Akley was hazing me.

11:26.680 --> 11:28.569
I've known fellows like you.

11:28.920 --> 11:30.490
You beat the Jew quotas.

11:30.560 --> 11:32.767
You slip in the faculty club
with a blazer and a smile.

11:32.840 --> 11:35.923
You spent your whole life fighting
your way to the top of the mountain.

11:36.040 --> 11:37.405
Take a look around.

11:37.520 --> 11:39.443
This group in this room,

11:39.960 --> 11:41.246
it's Everest.

11:42.560 --> 11:44.164
Quit acting like a Sherpa.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.209
Hey, Captain Marvel. Finally got
something to write home about, huh?

11:52.280 --> 11:53.770
What went through your head
when you shot him?

11:53.840 --> 11:57.640
- Who told you it was me?
- We know what went through the Jap's head.

11:57.720 --> 11:58.721
He was Chinese.

11:58.800 --> 12:01.690
Buddy who was at Attu Island told me
brains smell like circus peanuts.

12:01.760 --> 12:02.841
Is that true?

12:02.920 --> 12:04.365
I don't know.

12:04.440 --> 12:05.771
I've never been to the circus.

12:10.920 --> 12:12.285
God damn, Iowa.

12:12.680 --> 12:15.763
Already popped a spy this week.
You gonna pop your cherry, too?

12:16.280 --> 12:18.886
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

12:18.960 --> 12:25.127
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

12:25.200 --> 12:27.646
<i>Which nobody can deny</i>

12:35.920 --> 12:38.446
Corps of Engineers sent me
to the security offices.

12:38.520 --> 12:42.525
Security sent me to G2.
G2 sent me back to the engineers.

12:43.440 --> 12:46.250
Franz Kafka ought to sue
the US Army for plagiarism.

12:46.320 --> 12:47.446
Where are the files?

12:47.520 --> 12:50.524
The Army has taken a fine-toothed comb
to everything Sid Liao touched.

12:50.600 --> 12:52.568
It could be two weeks
before we get 'em back.

12:52.640 --> 12:55.564
- It could be two months.
-Goddamn test blew up in our face.

12:55.640 --> 12:58.723
Without those files,
we'll never figure out why.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.924
Well, all the king's horses
and all the king's men...

13:07.680 --> 13:09.808
Listen, there's another way.

13:10.120 --> 13:11.485
Akley's guys.

13:11.720 --> 13:13.404
They ran their own shockwave studies.

13:13.520 --> 13:15.363
Detonated everything
that wasn't nailed to the ground.

13:15.480 --> 13:18.051
We can move forward using their math.

13:18.120 --> 13:19.929
That's a bullshit waste of time.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.082
Akley understands
the situation we're in, okay?

13:22.160 --> 13:23.650
Just pay him a visit.

13:25.560 --> 13:27.767
Kiss the ring if you have to.

13:27.840 --> 13:29.649
Otherwise, that kid,

13:29.920 --> 13:31.570
he died for nothing.

13:37.080 --> 13:38.081
Here you go.

13:38.160 --> 13:39.810
I'm here to see Reed Akley.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.490
You've been guarding this post since April.

13:41.560 --> 13:43.528
How many times have you
seen me walk through it?

13:43.640 --> 13:45.244
That was before the incident at the gate.

13:45.320 --> 13:47.607
You need a new pass
from the security office.

13:47.720 --> 13:49.210
That could take a week.

13:50.520 --> 13:51.521
Here.

13:52.240 --> 13:54.527
Here's, um...
Here's 10 ration stamps.

13:54.600 --> 13:55.726
Go get him.

14:01.720 --> 14:03.245
They do this for free?

14:05.880 --> 14:07.882
You don't even have to tip them?

14:08.240 --> 14:11.050
You could invite one of them in
for a glass of lemonade.

14:11.320 --> 14:15.564
I drive in circles on Pajarito Road
just to get the car dirty again.

14:16.080 --> 14:17.286
They work so hard.

14:17.600 --> 14:20.206
You know they've been pulling
double shifts at the gate?

14:20.280 --> 14:22.009
All because of one bad apple.

14:22.080 --> 14:25.766
More like one bad Japple.
This is why God invented internment camps.

14:25.880 --> 14:27.848
Dot, the boy was Chinese.

14:27.920 --> 14:30.764
I stamped his badge myself
in the credentials office.

14:31.840 --> 14:33.763
Abby, did you get your work credential yet?

14:33.840 --> 14:36.730
Oh, mother of a 3-year-old
is plenty of job for me.

14:37.240 --> 14:38.401
We all work, dear.

14:39.240 --> 14:42.289
Eleanor Roosevelt says
we mustn't stand in our husband's shadow.

14:42.440 --> 14:45.808
If I looked like Eleanor Roosevelt,
I'd stand as far in the shadows as possible.

14:45.880 --> 14:48.042
I don't know how to do anything.

14:48.120 --> 14:49.201
Nonsense.

14:49.280 --> 14:53.205
Gladys is expecting a visit from the stork.
You can take over her job.

14:53.280 --> 14:55.521
You seem like a very good listener.

14:59.280 --> 15:01.806
Would you mind looking under my hood?

15:12.040 --> 15:13.530
Frank, what can I do for you?

15:13.640 --> 15:15.881
You can go get your boss.
I need to talk to a grown-up.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.604
Dr. Akley doesn't take walk-ins.

15:17.720 --> 15:19.563
I'm the best you're gonna do.

15:24.280 --> 15:26.647
The Army confiscated
half my files last night.

15:26.720 --> 15:28.484
I'm sorry to hear that.

15:28.600 --> 15:30.568
And I'm sorry to hear about
what happened to your guy.

15:30.640 --> 15:34.122
I don't need your sympathy.
I need Akley's shockwave studies.

15:34.320 --> 15:36.368
You insult me every time we talk.

15:36.880 --> 15:38.848
- You throw a lousy dinner party.
- Jesus Christ.

15:38.920 --> 15:42.561
But honestly, if it wasn't for
the new security rules, I'd help you, Frank.

15:42.640 --> 15:44.961
Science depends on
the free exchange of ideas.

15:45.040 --> 15:49.170
And as much as it galls me to say it,
implosion is an elegant solution.

15:49.240 --> 15:50.890
Then go get me the shockwave study.

15:50.960 --> 15:53.964
And lose my job?
Never mind the shit I took from my group

15:54.040 --> 15:56.122
after you conned me
into giving you the plutonium.

15:56.200 --> 15:59.249
Akley dismisses implosion because
he doesn't believe it'll win this war,

15:59.320 --> 16:00.651
that's fine.

16:00.720 --> 16:03.724
But someone who knows it'll work
but won't help because he's scared

16:03.800 --> 16:06.246
of being teased by a bunch of sycophants?

16:06.360 --> 16:07.805
You're worthless.

16:09.000 --> 16:13.005
And you're a self-righteous old man
on his professional deathbed.

16:16.200 --> 16:19.363
I've made sacrifices for this project
you couldn't possibly fathom.

16:20.200 --> 16:23.170
Watch out for a man on his deathbed.
He's got nothing to lose.

16:24.240 --> 16:27.050
Akley might not know what you really are,

16:27.280 --> 16:28.520
but I do.

16:35.720 --> 16:38.121
Effective yielding stress,
300,000 pounds per square inch.

16:38.200 --> 16:41.807
Detonation velocity,
6,700 meters per second.

16:42.320 --> 16:44.891
Heat of explosion, 650 calories per gram.

16:44.960 --> 16:47.691
What was the...
What was the collapse ratio again?

16:48.120 --> 16:51.886
Uh, I don't know, .546?

16:51.960 --> 16:53.803
No, .564.

16:54.800 --> 16:56.006
Damn it.

16:57.320 --> 16:58.560
We need that shockwave study.

16:58.640 --> 17:01.962
I cornered Akley at the gate.
The son of a bitch stonewalled me.

17:02.680 --> 17:04.967
I don't know if he's scared
to break compartmentalization

17:05.040 --> 17:07.520
or he just enjoys watching us
twist in the wind.

17:09.319 --> 17:11.003
His math was flawless.

17:11.400 --> 17:14.483
Immutable laws of physics.
It should have worked.

17:14.560 --> 17:16.926
A lot of things should have worked, Frank.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.924
But the law doesn't
take into account human error.

17:20.400 --> 17:21.765
So here we are.

17:24.880 --> 17:26.450
The kid's gone.

17:26.920 --> 17:28.410
So are his files.

17:34.920 --> 17:36.365
We're going over Akley's head.

17:41.240 --> 17:43.481
I just never thought
we'd be a two-income family.

17:43.560 --> 17:45.210
- Forty cents an hour?
- You all right?

17:45.280 --> 17:47.931
More like one income
and some pocket change.

17:48.400 --> 17:51.529
If Daddy found out I was getting a job,
he'd keel over.

17:51.600 --> 17:53.523
Maybe we should call and tell him.

17:54.360 --> 17:55.407
You're a modern woman.

17:55.480 --> 17:57.130
- Ah! Charlie.
- I think it's sexy.

17:58.120 --> 18:00.885
Anyways, they haven't hired me yet.
Apparently I have to pass an exam.

18:00.960 --> 18:02.564
You know I don't test well.

18:02.640 --> 18:03.641
It's not that kind of test.

18:03.720 --> 18:06.246
You know, Liza Winter failed it
and she's a Ph.D.

18:06.320 --> 18:07.970
I heard that's why she doesn't work.

18:08.720 --> 18:09.881
I wish her husband failed it.

18:10.080 --> 18:11.491
<i>Attention. Due to heightened security</i>

18:11.560 --> 18:14.564
<i>all residents on the Hill may be
subject to random searches.</i>

18:14.640 --> 18:18.042
If I didn't know any better, Mrs. Isaacs,
I'd think you actually want this job.

18:18.120 --> 18:21.602
No, I don't want the job.
I want them to want me for the job.

18:24.160 --> 18:27.448
Sit back and relax.
There are no wrong answers.

18:33.600 --> 18:36.251
How many alcoholic beverages
do you consume per week?

18:37.600 --> 18:40.922
Um... A little Manischewitz at Passover.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.004
Hm. What is the total value
of your household assets?

18:44.880 --> 18:49.329
Charlie and I have just over $900
in a savings account at Middlesex Bank.

18:49.800 --> 18:51.325
And we own a car.

18:52.080 --> 18:53.241
And...

18:53.960 --> 18:56.281
There's a separate trust in my name.

18:56.960 --> 18:59.008
The amount is around 200,000.

19:03.240 --> 19:04.890
Did you know Sidney James Liao?

19:06.200 --> 19:07.201
No.

19:09.080 --> 19:12.163
Have you ever been charged with
or convicted of a crime?

19:12.240 --> 19:13.241
Yes.

19:13.320 --> 19:15.926
Have you ever been charged with
or convicted of a felony?

19:17.040 --> 19:18.087
Yes.

19:18.680 --> 19:21.411
I borrowed
my piano teacher's Studebaker.

19:21.480 --> 19:23.960
It was a misunderstanding
and she dropped the charges.

19:27.360 --> 19:30.045
Have you ever had relations
with a man outside your marriage?

19:34.920 --> 19:35.967
No.

19:37.360 --> 19:40.250
Have you ever been an officer
or a member of an organization

19:40.320 --> 19:43.529
dedicated to the violent overthrow
of the United States Government?

19:46.480 --> 19:47.481
Um...

19:48.280 --> 19:49.441
No.

19:52.120 --> 19:54.088
The Colonel's not in.

19:54.200 --> 19:58.250
- Well, where is he? I will go to him.
- He doesn't wish to see you, Dr. Winter.

19:59.920 --> 20:02.161
Tell him to wish in one hand
and shit in the other.

20:02.240 --> 20:04.083
See which fills up first.

20:06.160 --> 20:09.289
Make sure he's
not allowed back into this building.

20:09.400 --> 20:10.765
Right this way, ma'am.

20:11.360 --> 20:12.600
Badge.

20:13.200 --> 20:14.440
Thank you, ma'am.

20:14.760 --> 20:16.091
Straight down the hall.

20:18.160 --> 20:21.004
You passed with flying colors.

20:21.080 --> 20:24.721
Truth is, this job is just like Harvard.
Getting in is the hardest part.

20:24.800 --> 20:25.926
Oh, good.

20:26.120 --> 20:28.851
Okay, suspicious words and phrases.

20:28.920 --> 20:31.127
Updated hourly since
the shootout at O.K. Corral.

20:31.200 --> 20:33.282
- All right.
- You hear any of these words,

20:33.400 --> 20:37.371
you're gonna press this button
and security will hop on the line.

20:37.960 --> 20:39.849
You can't say "chop suey"?

20:41.520 --> 20:44.205
- None of us speaks Chinese, so no.
- Oh.

20:44.400 --> 20:49.201
Anyway, Dr. Oppenheimer is 146.
Maintenance is 138. Colonel is 99.

20:49.280 --> 20:50.850
Where's the directory?

20:52.000 --> 20:53.764
- Oh.
- Do not answer that.

20:55.800 --> 20:57.882
What did they ask that was so bad?

20:58.600 --> 21:01.809
Could be, "What time is it there?"
"What did you do at work today?"

21:01.920 --> 21:05.641
Mmm-mmm. He wanted to know if she was
cooking sloppy joes for dinner.

21:10.160 --> 21:11.571
What's wrong with that?

21:11.640 --> 21:12.641
Nothing.

21:12.800 --> 21:14.165
They were boring me.

21:16.560 --> 21:18.881
- I'm Abby.
- Elodie.

21:19.520 --> 21:20.885
<i>Enchantée.</i>

21:22.280 --> 21:23.611
<i>Enchantée.</i>

21:25.360 --> 21:27.761
Charlie, join us at the PX?

21:27.840 --> 21:30.411
Or are you gonna keep pondering
the mysteries of your navel?

21:30.480 --> 21:32.403
I brought leftovers, thanks.

21:32.520 --> 21:34.727
Well, we can set up a scholarship fund

21:34.800 --> 21:36.643
if your wife's not giving
you enough lunch money.

21:36.720 --> 21:39.007
At least then you could say
that you achieved something today.

21:39.120 --> 21:41.043
You haven't written
on that board in two days.

21:41.120 --> 21:45.842
Physics is 90% thinking,
9% writing, and 1% talking.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.287
I never met so many
one-percenters in my life.

21:49.440 --> 21:51.283
For the last three months,
while you've been making your name

21:51.360 --> 21:53.727
writing school papers
and eating Cracker Jacks at Fenway,

21:53.800 --> 21:56.690
we've been stuck in this desert shithole
working six days a week.

21:58.360 --> 22:02.251
Now I know another tortured genius who
pisses on everyone from his high horse.

22:02.440 --> 22:05.330
He's got an office in
the old groundskeeper's shed out back.

22:05.720 --> 22:06.801
If you're not gonna join this group,

22:06.880 --> 22:09.281
maybe you should go share
your leftovers with Frank Winter, hmm?

22:11.040 --> 22:13.202
You want me to join the group?

22:13.720 --> 22:14.767
All right.

22:15.440 --> 22:17.920
How long you been working on this for?
A week?

22:21.480 --> 22:23.960
I've known fellows like you, too.

22:25.080 --> 22:28.880
Vacuous. The empty space between stars.

22:33.960 --> 22:35.086
Two weeks?

22:36.840 --> 22:40.401
See, there is no group.

22:43.120 --> 22:45.646
There's Reed Akley

22:48.800 --> 22:50.165
and there's me.

22:52.240 --> 22:54.129
And the biggest mystery

22:54.920 --> 22:58.163
I've been pondering since I got here,

23:04.760 --> 23:08.560
is what the hell the rest of you've been
doing for the last three months?

23:12.280 --> 23:13.805
Oh! Oh, my lord!

23:14.600 --> 23:16.762
- Oh!
- Do you need security?

23:16.920 --> 23:19.969
No, no, no. It's nothing like that. It's a...

23:20.520 --> 23:23.046
It's a personal matter.

23:25.160 --> 23:26.525
<i>Oui</i>.

23:28.600 --> 23:30.250
Tuesday, <i>Madame</i> Cook.

23:30.320 --> 23:33.802
She's in Ohio and her amour
is on the payphone by the PX.

23:34.600 --> 23:36.250
I've used that phone.

23:36.320 --> 23:39.164
Oh, I hope the janitor wiped the mouthpiece.

23:39.680 --> 23:44.447
Enjoy being a little fly on this wall
learning all your neighbors' dirty laundry.

23:46.800 --> 23:50.600
And then you tell me all the good stuff
and we decide who to blackmail. Hmm?

23:57.320 --> 24:00.642
You know, I've seen you before.
I think we're neighbors.

24:01.480 --> 24:03.926
Ah. What a small town.

24:05.640 --> 24:08.644
Well, I guess we'll be seeing
a lot more of each other.

24:52.280 --> 24:53.611
Can I help you?

24:54.360 --> 24:56.727
Oh, ma'am, I'm PFC Dunlavey.

24:57.400 --> 24:58.526
Is your husband home?

24:58.680 --> 24:59.727
Husband?

25:02.000 --> 25:03.490
Nope, doesn't ring a bell.

25:03.560 --> 25:05.483
Are you Mrs. Winter? We...

25:05.720 --> 25:09.361
We have some questions for Dr. Winter.
I work with Colonel Cox.

25:22.400 --> 25:23.765
Is Dr. Winter here?

25:24.880 --> 25:27.611
- I need to speak to him about, uh, Sid Liao.
- Sid?

25:28.240 --> 25:30.083
Brilliant mathematician.

25:30.240 --> 25:31.571
Terrible punster.

25:31.800 --> 25:36.203
I suppose the only bright side
is that Grace is only five years old,

25:36.280 --> 25:38.886
so in a couple of years
she won't even remember him.

25:40.520 --> 25:42.249
I didn't know that Sid had a family.

25:45.560 --> 25:46.925
Did you ever even meet him?

25:50.160 --> 25:51.400
Only very briefly.

25:52.240 --> 25:53.287
And where was that?

25:53.480 --> 25:54.481
Um...

25:55.000 --> 25:56.809
In his final moments.

25:57.560 --> 26:01.201
It became my responsibility
to ensure the safety of the base.

26:02.880 --> 26:03.881
You were at the gate?

26:03.960 --> 26:05.849
He drew a weapon, ma'am.
I...

26:07.080 --> 26:08.286
I didn't have time to think.

26:09.920 --> 26:12.082
They've got a chaplain on the Hill,
but he's a Baptist.

26:12.160 --> 26:13.924
He doesn't take confession.

26:15.360 --> 26:18.170
I said 20 Our Fathers,
but I'm not sure it's enough.

26:29.040 --> 26:30.883
Please, take a seat.

26:39.560 --> 26:40.607
So...

26:43.320 --> 26:45.641
Mr. Dunlavey, where do you call home?

26:46.280 --> 26:48.647
- Jones County, Iowa.
- Iowa?

26:49.280 --> 26:53.001
We drove through Iowa on our way out here.
It's beautiful country.

26:53.160 --> 26:55.561
- Your people are farmers?
- Corn mostly.

26:55.640 --> 26:57.130
You got hit by the Dust Bowl?

26:58.640 --> 27:00.165
Lost half our crop.

27:01.040 --> 27:04.328
So then you decided to enlist?

27:06.080 --> 27:08.686
Oh, no, ma'am, we make do all right.
I just...

27:09.720 --> 27:11.927
I couldn't sit back
with what's happening over there.

27:14.520 --> 27:15.601
Right.

27:16.760 --> 27:19.161
So what is it you want to know about Sid?

27:19.960 --> 27:21.200
Do you think...

27:23.480 --> 27:25.209
- Was he really...
- A spy?

27:26.960 --> 27:28.246
Honestly,

27:28.720 --> 27:31.690
I don't know what label to put on Sid Liao.

27:32.360 --> 27:34.488
Spy, scientist. I...

27:36.960 --> 27:38.450
I do know

27:40.480 --> 27:42.369
that I'm sorry he's gone.

27:44.200 --> 27:45.645
Yes, ma'am.

27:46.880 --> 27:49.884
Is it true you found
confidential documents in his car?

27:56.760 --> 27:58.569
I, um...

27:58.720 --> 28:00.882
I recovered them from under the floor mat.

28:08.080 --> 28:11.448
Dr. Winter, sir,
I'm Private First Class Dunlavey.

28:14.920 --> 28:16.160
Give us a minute.

28:24.520 --> 28:26.409
First class since when?

28:26.600 --> 28:28.364
They told me he was shot by a private.

28:30.400 --> 28:32.323
I wanted to say how sorry I am for your loss.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.809
You got nothing to apologize for.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.002
You did what you had to do.

28:51.920 --> 28:55.811
It'll take the four of us weeks
to reconstruct Sid's work.

28:55.920 --> 28:57.843
Guy could get through
a differential equation

28:57.920 --> 29:00.082
faster than I can get through a hamburger.

29:00.200 --> 29:02.601
He had a shortcut.
He was gonna show me.

29:02.680 --> 29:05.365
Maybe it was sorcery.
Oriental shamanism.

29:05.440 --> 29:06.965
Don't talk about him.

29:36.560 --> 29:37.561
Oh.

29:37.800 --> 29:40.531
Pretty sure his wife was
the last person to wash these.

29:45.520 --> 29:47.329
What is that?

29:47.840 --> 29:48.921
Spurs.

29:51.880 --> 29:53.450
He bought them in Santa Fe.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.526
Said that he wanted to be
the first Chinese cowboy.

29:56.760 --> 29:59.570
Remember that time he tried
to get the Indian maids

29:59.640 --> 30:01.722
to reenact Custer's Last Stand?

30:01.800 --> 30:03.450
Oh, my God.

30:05.040 --> 30:06.690
Liao was Custer.

30:18.280 --> 30:19.281
Put it back.

30:35.040 --> 30:36.280
That boy,

30:37.920 --> 30:40.321
he was just looking for someone to talk to.

30:40.440 --> 30:42.169
Think he feels better now?

30:42.240 --> 30:45.050
It'll be a long time before
any of us feels better.

30:46.080 --> 30:49.050
You knew Sid Liao for five years, Frank.

31:02.280 --> 31:03.566
Frank Winter.

31:05.800 --> 31:06.881
What do you want?

31:06.960 --> 31:11.090
We have reason to believe you're
in violation of US title code 18 chapter 37.

31:11.560 --> 31:13.608
The Federal Espionage Act.

31:19.520 --> 31:23.161
One of the guards tipped us off.
The file was in the lining of his bag.

31:23.240 --> 31:25.891
He said he'd confess,
but he'd only talk to you, sir.

31:31.640 --> 31:34.325
Hijacking classified papers.

31:36.600 --> 31:38.728
Seems to be an epidemic around here.

31:40.120 --> 31:42.771
- The chemical study of magnesium sulfate.
- Epsom salt.

31:43.520 --> 31:46.046
If it falls into Hitler's hands,
he'll enjoy a warm bath.

31:48.840 --> 31:50.285
You're a hard man to find.

31:50.440 --> 31:53.205
I figured stealing a file
would get me an audience.

31:53.280 --> 31:55.169
You paid off
one of my guards to turn you in?

31:58.000 --> 32:00.970
Excuse me, Dr. Winter.
I have a prime rib that requires my attention.

32:01.040 --> 32:05.170
I need Akley's shockwave studies.
He'll hand them over if you tell him to.

32:05.920 --> 32:07.524
A man of your intelligence,

32:07.720 --> 32:10.451
I'm sure you can understand
the concept of compartmentalization.

32:10.520 --> 32:12.568
What's yours is yours, what's Akley's is his.

32:12.640 --> 32:16.042
Everything in its own box.
Including my best mathematician.

32:16.160 --> 32:17.605
Wars have casualties.

32:17.680 --> 32:20.843
And the first casualty of war is truth.
Isn't that the saying?

32:21.000 --> 32:22.684
The first casualty of this war

32:22.760 --> 32:27.402
was a Polish hayseed with a Karabinek rifle
back in September, 1939.

32:27.480 --> 32:31.883
Four years and a few million funerals ago.
Almost 40,000 of them Americans.

32:32.840 --> 32:35.320
Your mathematician is a drop in the ocean.

32:36.840 --> 32:39.241
You know, I've learned
a lot about Sid Liao this week.

32:39.320 --> 32:41.527
He was a Japanese agent. He was a Stalinist.

32:43.600 --> 32:46.570
No one seems to know
he was a private in the US Army.

32:47.880 --> 32:49.609
Or that you signed his draft papers.

32:51.840 --> 32:54.286
I'm assuming that's
a truth you'd like to bury.

32:58.760 --> 32:59.921
Get up.

33:00.560 --> 33:04.929
There are 147 different
extensions on the Hill.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.526
I might not have your head for numbers,
but I already know half of them.

33:07.600 --> 33:09.090
You can quiz me.

33:10.880 --> 33:12.166
What did you do at work today?

33:12.240 --> 33:13.321
Trick question.

33:13.400 --> 33:15.129
If somebody asked that on the phone,
I'd have to cut in.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.001
Hmm.

33:17.880 --> 33:18.881
Hello.

33:19.880 --> 33:20.927
Sorry.

33:21.880 --> 33:23.006
Are you all right?

33:25.160 --> 33:26.161
It's the dinner hour.

33:26.240 --> 33:28.288
Can you tell the ladies
of the "Welcome Wagon"

33:28.400 --> 33:30.129
that they're not welcome?

33:33.840 --> 33:36.286
- Dr. Akley.
- Oh, please, call me Reed.

33:37.240 --> 33:39.288
- It looks like home in here already.
- Oh.

33:39.520 --> 33:41.409
May I borrow your husband
for a moment, please?

33:41.760 --> 33:42.886
Yes, of course.

33:53.000 --> 33:56.561
I understand we had
a little detonation in the lab today.

33:59.640 --> 34:03.087
Those boys have a lot of bluster,
but you certainly did a number on them.

34:03.160 --> 34:05.970
Nothing irreparable.
I imagine you'll apologize.

34:08.760 --> 34:11.764
You have a long road ahead, Charlie.
You've only just arrived.

34:11.920 --> 34:14.321
Is that why you gave me
an unsolvable problem?

34:15.040 --> 34:17.360
Some kind of freshman hazing ritual?

34:17.440 --> 34:19.329
I gave you the velocity distribution problem

34:19.400 --> 34:22.529
because I think you're the only man
here who's capable of solving it.

34:23.440 --> 34:26.170
You probably spent your whole life
surrounded by people

34:26.239 --> 34:29.289
who weren't smart enough
to recognize how smart you are.

34:29.360 --> 34:31.761
But I do. It's the reason
why I brought you here.

34:31.880 --> 34:34.406
You are a once-in-a-generation mind.

34:35.600 --> 34:36.647
Thank you, sir.

34:41.840 --> 34:44.127
But I know someone even smarter than you.

34:44.960 --> 34:47.485
When I met him, he was 25 years old

34:48.040 --> 34:50.771
and he was already reimagining
quantum mechanics.

34:51.480 --> 34:54.324
And at 30, he was a leading light in our field.

34:54.400 --> 34:57.165
And now at 40, he could end
this war once and for all.

34:57.320 --> 34:59.766
- Oppenheimer?
- Werner Heisenberg.

35:01.480 --> 35:03.926
He's the world's most
brilliant scientific mind

35:04.600 --> 35:06.887
and he's running Hitler's bomb project.

35:09.960 --> 35:11.962
Never forget, Charlie,

35:13.000 --> 35:15.651
that is the man you're competing with.

35:27.560 --> 35:29.927
Just go through it. Just get through it.

35:32.400 --> 35:33.731
Open your briefcase.

35:34.360 --> 35:36.806
Like your buddies opened my friend's skull?

35:36.880 --> 35:38.291
Maybe it was you.

35:39.080 --> 35:40.320
Okay, Meeks, come on.

35:59.280 --> 36:00.725
<i>Salud!</i>

36:14.200 --> 36:17.170
Well, here's to the Chinaman.
May he rest in pieces.

36:17.240 --> 36:18.685
Shut up, Crosley.

36:18.800 --> 36:20.245
I dare you to say it again.

36:20.800 --> 36:22.689
All 10 stone of you?
Meeks, I'm trembling.

36:25.240 --> 36:26.241
Excuse me. I'm so sorry.

36:26.320 --> 36:31.326
Look, Crosley's a top-shelf horse's ass,
but we have no idea who sold Sid out.

36:32.440 --> 36:34.124
I'll get the next round.

36:41.520 --> 36:43.443
Two more for me and the spy killer.

36:53.440 --> 36:54.646
Dismissed.

37:12.280 --> 37:15.284
This is what happened
the last time I did you a favor.

37:16.080 --> 37:18.447
I won't make that same mistake twice.

37:21.200 --> 37:24.124
Do you know where the surviving
members of your group are right now?

37:24.280 --> 37:27.204
They're drowning their sorrows
at the post exchange.

37:27.920 --> 37:30.127
I have MPs parked outside.

37:31.160 --> 37:33.367
You think the truth is on your side?

37:34.000 --> 37:35.729
Let's bring them down here

37:35.800 --> 37:39.168
and you can tell them exactly how
Sid Liao came to be lying in this box.

37:42.120 --> 37:45.886
I don't wanna see you in my office again.
I don't wanna hear your name.

37:46.480 --> 37:48.767
We're finished, understood?

38:10.640 --> 38:11.641
Easy, virgin.

38:12.040 --> 38:14.247
You're safer penetrating occupied France.

38:18.520 --> 38:20.488
- You killed him.
- I'm sorry?

38:20.560 --> 38:21.686
Private Weaver over there.

38:21.840 --> 38:24.366
What was that last score?
A hundred balls to less than 20?

38:24.480 --> 38:25.845
Just luck, I guess.

38:25.920 --> 38:27.206
From what I hear,
we're the ones who are lucky

38:27.320 --> 38:28.731
you were at East Gate the other night.

38:29.800 --> 38:31.245
My roommate works nights.

38:31.720 --> 38:32.926
How about you walk a girl home?

38:33.000 --> 38:35.606
It's really noisy in here. I don't live too far.

38:35.680 --> 38:37.842
Maybe someone else wants to play, Private.

38:38.920 --> 38:42.641
You know, I had a friend
who would have run the table on you.

38:43.200 --> 38:44.645
He was a geometry genius.

38:44.800 --> 38:45.801
Get lost.

38:46.360 --> 38:48.408
Just wanna know if the private here
ever got a chance

38:48.480 --> 38:50.482
to play Sid Liao at straight pool.

38:52.160 --> 38:53.685
What do you want from me?

39:16.920 --> 39:17.921
Easy, easy!

39:27.000 --> 39:29.651
It's all right. It's all right.
Come on, now, let's go have a beer.

39:56.600 --> 39:58.284
Frank, are you all right?

40:00.600 --> 40:02.170
It was six years.

40:05.680 --> 40:09.480
Sid walked into my office
in Berkeley six years ago.

40:11.440 --> 40:13.966
He was a college senior with a bad haircut.

40:19.840 --> 40:22.764
When they told me
I could handpick my team,

40:24.960 --> 40:26.371
he was my first call.

40:29.640 --> 40:31.642
You didn't put him in that car.

40:37.760 --> 40:39.569
Whatever we're doing here,

40:41.560 --> 40:43.562
please tell me it's worth it.

40:48.160 --> 40:49.525
If it works

40:52.160 --> 40:54.162
we won't just end this war,

40:56.320 --> 40:58.004
we'll end all war.

41:01.120 --> 41:02.326
Forever.

41:05.840 --> 41:07.842
Do you really believe that?

41:17.880 --> 41:19.882
<i>We've never met</i>

41:20.760 --> 41:22.808
<i>and I doubt we ever will.</i>

41:24.640 --> 41:27.371
<i>I'm prohibited from disclosing who I am,</i>

41:28.520 --> 41:29.885
<i>where I am,</i>

41:31.840 --> 41:34.525
<i>or in what capacity I knew your husband.</i>

41:37.240 --> 41:39.004
<i>But I did know him.</i>

41:44.040 --> 41:48.568
<i>I wish I could tell you
some good came from his passing.</i>

41:51.440 --> 41:53.442
<i>But it brought only pain.</i>

42:02.240 --> 42:03.651
<i>There's more to be said.</i>

42:09.200 --> 42:11.328
<i>I'm not at liberty to say it.</i>

42:13.400 --> 42:16.131
<i>Not even permitted
to write your husband's name.</i>

42:18.840 --> 42:20.524
<i>A man's name.</i>

42:23.200 --> 42:25.931
<i>The very last thing a person holds on to.</i>

42:29.120 --> 42:31.441
<i>Even after he leaves this world.</i>

42:36.080 --> 42:38.606
<i>Tell his daughter he was dedicated.</i>

42:40.640 --> 42:42.404
<i>He did his job.</i>

42:44.440 --> 42:46.204
<i>And he did it Well.</i>

42:48.960 --> 42:50.610
<i>He was a good man.</i>

42:55.080 --> 42:59.449
<i>In that, I hope you find
some measure of comfort.</i>

43:03.200 --> 43:04.281
Shit.

43:04.400 --> 43:07.404
<i>I myself find solace knowing that,</i>

43:07.520 --> 43:09.602
<i>nameless, though I may be,</i>

43:12.080 --> 43:15.323
<i>we can at least connect in this small way.</i>

43:19.040 --> 43:21.725
<i>Know you are in our thoughts and prayers.</i>

43:30.480 --> 43:32.164
<i>Yours sincerely,</i>

43:34.200 --> 43:35.804
<i>Number G-22.</i>

44:48.360 --> 44:49.771
You did it.
