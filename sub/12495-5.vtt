No, you'll have

Oh, he...

00:51.844 --> 00:54.555
His goldfish had babies.

00:55.014 --> 00:56.390
What goldfish?

00:56.431 --> 00:58.266
I didn't know Henry

00:56.431 --> 00:58.266
had a goldfish.

00:58.308 --> 01:00.895
Well, he does

00:58.308 --> 01:00.895

Do we know

01:02.437 --> 01:04.064
who the father is?

01:06.608 --> 01:09.444

did you notice our new...

01:54.865 --> 01:55.824
skinny jeans?

01:56.992 --> 02:00.704
They're like regular jeans,

01:56.992 --> 02:00.704
but super tight.

02:01.914 --> 02:03.040
Girls love them.

02:03.415 --> 02:05.292

around Swellview Pond.

02:20.766 --> 02:22.851
I've been wearing

02:20.766 --> 02:22.851
the wrong pants.

02:24.352 --> 02:27.940
Uh, your problems

02:24.352 --> 02:27.940
are way bigger

02:24.352 --> 02:27.940
than your pants.

02:28.732 --> 02:30.651
I got to start somewhere.

02:32.402 --> 02:34.696
Hey, Captain Man,

02:32.402 --> 02:34.696
our car's ready.

02:34.738 --> 02:36.073
Then let's ride.

02:36.115 --> 02:37.992
Wait, Captain Man!

02:36.115 --> 02:37.992
Captain Man!

02:38.033 --> 02:40.619
Yes, you in the loose pants.

02:40.661 --> 02:43.038
Will you sign my Captain Man

02:40.661 --> 02:43.038

02:43.455 --> 02:45.791
Sure. Just bring it up here

02:43.455 --> 02:45.791

(crowd gasps)

02:46.792 --> 02:48.085
(groans)

02:48.127 --> 02:49.753
It hit him in the mouth!

02:49.795 --> 02:51.338
Sorry, Captain Man!

02:51.755 --> 02:52.673
No worries.

02:52.714 --> 02:54.215
I'm okay!

02:57.594 --> 02:58.553
Captain Man.

02:58.595 --> 02:59.721
What?

03:02.933 --> 03:03.934
Blood.

03:03.976 --> 03:05.102
Why do you have

03:03.976 --> 03:05.102
a bloody thumb?

03:05.477 --> 03:07.855
I don't.

03:05.477 --> 03:07.855
You have a bloody lip

03:07.896 --> 03:09.230
from that toy

03:07.896 --> 03:09.230
hitting you in the face.

03:10.816 --> 03:12.901
But...

03:10.816 --> 03:12.901
But that's impossible.

03:12.943 --> 03:14.862
I can't be injured.

03:12.943 --> 03:14.862
I'm Captain Man.

03:14.903 --> 03:17.196
Well, Captain Man's lip

03:14.903 --> 03:17.196
is bleeding.

03:18.406 --> 03:20.534
Henry.

03:18.406 --> 03:20.534
Yeah?

03:20.575 --> 03:22.161
I'm not okay.

03:22.201 --> 03:23.662
Shh!

03:24.705 --> 03:26.414
It all just kind of happened.

03:26.456 --> 03:28.876
My dad was

03:26.456 --> 03:28.876
an irresponsible scientist.

03:28.917 --> 03:30.669
I wanted

03:28.917 --> 03:30.669
an afterschool job.

03:30.711 --> 03:33.630

03:36.717 --> 03:38.677
a pretty interesting guy.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.470

He turned out to be...

03:44.850 --> 03:46.060
<i>You know the name.</i>

03:46.101 --> 03:48.269

That's right, Henry.

03:48.311 --> 03:51.148
<i>In time, I realized</i>

03:48.311 --> 03:51.148
<i>that being a superhero</i>

03:51.190 --> 03:52.482
<i>is a lot to handle alone.</i>

03:52.524 --> 03:55.360

Yeah.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.393
It's been two seconds,

05:08.308 --> 05:10.393
the pain should be gone by now.

05:10.435 --> 05:11.853
We need more tests.

05:11.895 --> 05:13.772
No, we've checked enough

05:11.895 --> 05:13.772
of my body parts.

What about his butt?

05:13.814 --> 05:15.857
Check his butt.

05:15.899 --> 05:17.276
We should check your butt.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.653
Check my butt how?

05:20.445 --> 05:23.115
Face the other way

Oh, no, no, no.

05:26.201 --> 05:28.203
You've already

05:26.201 --> 05:28.203
stabbed my neck,

05:26.201 --> 05:28.203
poured acid on my foot,

05:28.245 --> 05:29.621

I'm also vulnerable

to butt wounds.

This is great

05:36.377 --> 05:38.255
frozen yogurt.

No one's been able to injure me

05:44.845 --> 05:47.306

05:51.977 --> 05:54.104
Watch this news footage

05:51.977 --> 05:54.104
from the award thing yesterday.

05:54.146 --> 05:56.273
Here, I'll play it

05:54.146 --> 05:56.273
in slow motion.

05:56.857 --> 05:59.693
(slowed audio, garbled)

05:59.734 --> 06:01.569
(Charlotte)

05:59.734 --> 06:01.569
There. See right there?

06:01.611 --> 06:03.030
You see that woman

06:01.611 --> 06:03.030
with the perfume?

06:03.071 --> 06:05.115
She intentionally

06:03.071 --> 06:05.115
sprayed me.

06:05.907 --> 06:08.535
But perfume

06:05.907 --> 06:08.535
wouldn't make you

06:05.907 --> 06:08.535
lose your powers.

06:08.576 --> 06:10.078
True.

06:10.120 --> 06:11.872
Perfume wouldn't.

06:11.913 --> 06:14.082
Only the tears

06:11.913 --> 06:14.082
of the jolly beetle.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.168
Jolly what?

06:19.546 --> 06:20.463
(Gooch)

06:19.546 --> 06:20.463
There.

06:20.505 --> 06:22.174
The jolly beetle.

06:22.216 --> 06:25.052
One of the rarest

06:22.216 --> 06:25.052
and happiest bugs on earth.

06:25.719 --> 06:28.763
So, you guys are saying

06:25.719 --> 06:28.763
that a jolly beetle

06:28.805 --> 06:30.349
can take away

06:28.805 --> 06:30.349
Captain Man's power?

06:30.389 --> 06:31.766
Not the beetle itself.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.518
The beetle's tears.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.354
You see, when they cry,

06:35.394 --> 06:37.356
their tears

06:35.394 --> 06:37.356
contain an enzyme,

06:37.438 --> 06:39.941
like an acid that breaks down

06:37.438 --> 06:39.941
molecular density.

06:39.983 --> 06:41.360
And molecular density

06:41.400 --> 06:44.363
is what makes

06:41.400 --> 06:44.363
Captain Man undamageable.

06:44.403 --> 06:46.156
And you guys think that

06:44.403 --> 06:46.156
that lady's perfume...

06:46.198 --> 06:48.783
Contained the tears

06:46.198 --> 06:48.783
of a jolly beetle.

06:48.825 --> 06:50.744
Ah, that's impossible.

06:51.203 --> 06:52.787
To fill a whole

06:51.203 --> 06:52.787
perfume bottle,

06:52.829 --> 06:54.831
you'd need tears

06:52.829 --> 06:54.831
from dozens of jolly beetles.

06:54.873 --> 06:57.125
And they would

06:54.873 --> 06:57.125
all have to be crying.

06:57.792 --> 07:00.587
But if those beetles

06:57.792 --> 07:00.587
are so jolly,

07:00.628 --> 07:01.880
what would make them cry?

07:07.635 --> 07:09.388

15:44.611 --> 15:46.195
Soon I'll have enough

15:44.611 --> 15:46.195
beetle tears

15:46.237 --> 15:47.864
to ensure

15:46.237 --> 15:47.864
that Captain Man

15:47.906 --> 15:50.074
will never be

15:47.906 --> 15:50.074
a threat to me again.

15:50.116 --> 15:51.785
(Nurse Cohort)

15:50.116 --> 15:51.785
And then what?

15:51.826 --> 15:53.536
Well, then I can

15:51.826 --> 15:53.536
do whatever I want

15:53.578 --> 15:54.913
here in Swellview.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.289
Well, what do you

15:54.954 --> 15:56.289
want to do?

15:56.330 --> 15:58.165
I don't know.

15:58.207 --> 15:59.918
(grunts)

16:02.336 --> 16:03.797
Okay, nobody move.

16:03.838 --> 16:07.592
Who's that boy?

16:03.838 --> 16:07.592
Easy, don't get nervous.

16:08.509 --> 16:11.095
It's just Kid Dumpster.

16:11.137 --> 16:13.097
That's Danger.

16:13.139 --> 16:14.515
I know.

16:14.557 --> 16:16.601
I was being disrespectful.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.520
Allow me

16:17.977 --> 16:19.520
to introduce myself.

16:19.562 --> 16:21.314
Yeah, I know who you are.

16:21.355 --> 16:22.607
Doctor Maniac.

16:23.524 --> 16:25.568
It's Minyak.

16:25.610 --> 16:29.071
I know.

16:25.610 --> 16:29.071
I was being disrespectful.

16:31.574 --> 16:32.992
It's over.

16:33.033 --> 16:35.578
I'm taking you

16:33.033 --> 16:35.578
and your hot nurse to jail.

16:36.496 --> 16:37.831
Goons!

16:40.040 --> 16:42.627
And now I think I shall have

16:40.040 --> 16:42.627
to teach you some manners.

16:45.797 --> 16:47.423
Why don't you teach me?

16:48.716 --> 16:49.884
Captain Man!

16:50.384 --> 16:52.553
You are handsome.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.055
And you are... correct.

16:56.265 --> 16:57.391
He may be handsome,

16:57.433 --> 17:00.060
but he can be hurt now,

16:57.433 --> 17:00.060
just like any man.

17:01.395 --> 17:02.856
You, hold the boy.

17:02.897 --> 17:05.107
You, hurt Handsome.

17:06.901 --> 17:09.946
Ooh, I'm so scared

17:06.901 --> 17:09.946
of your little club.

17:09.988 --> 17:12.239
What do you do with that thing,

17:09.988 --> 17:12.239
spank hamsters?

17:14.450 --> 17:16.076
Oh, now it's bigger.

17:16.911 --> 17:19.163
Get him, Captain Man!

17:36.514 --> 17:37.682
(groans)

17:37.724 --> 17:38.975
Come on, I had to.

17:40.100 --> 17:42.061
(grunts)

17:46.482 --> 17:47.650
Captain Man, watch out!

17:52.488 --> 17:54.407
Careful.

17:52.488 --> 17:54.407
These are dangerous.

18:00.663 --> 18:02.749
Yeah!

18:00.663 --> 18:02.749
That was awesome!

18:02.790 --> 18:03.750
Thanks.

18:03.791 --> 18:05.418
But it really hurt my knee.

18:06.836 --> 18:09.213
I'm going to see to it

18:15.302 --> 18:16.846

Count your toes.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.147
(grunts)

18:29.817 --> 18:32.028

are going to take

18:29.817 --> 18:32.028
these beetles

18:32.070 --> 18:33.487
back to my headquarters

18:33.529 --> 18:35.073
and figure out a way

18:33.529 --> 18:35.073
to get my power back.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.491
You'll have

18:35.114 --> 18:37.491
to catch them first.

18:40.369 --> 18:41.829

18:42.663 --> 18:44.040

we got to go after them.

18:56.427 --> 18:57.971
No! No!

18:58.012 --> 18:59.472
That's yokonium gas.

18:59.513 --> 19:00.848
It'll destroy the beetles.

19:01.557 --> 19:03.893
So?

19:01.557 --> 19:03.893
We need the beetles

19:01.557 --> 19:03.893
to get my power back.

19:03.935 --> 19:05.185
We can't let them die.

19:08.272 --> 19:10.608
Oh no.

19:10.650 --> 19:13.193
The gas already

19:10.650 --> 19:13.193
killed this one.

19:22.536 --> 19:24.497
So, how does this work?

19:24.538 --> 19:27.083
You see, when the beetles

19:24.538 --> 19:27.083
watch something funny,

19:27.125 --> 19:29.085
they secrete euphoric acid,

19:29.127 --> 19:31.295
which we can use to reverse

19:29.127 --> 19:31.295
the weakening effect

19:31.337 --> 19:32.296
of the tears.

I extract the fluid.

Setting to intensity five.

my Captain Man back.
