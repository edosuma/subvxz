00:12.448 --> 00:14.416
- All right, we do this smart,
and we do this--

00:14.483 --> 00:15.917
right now! Oh, golly!

00:25.261 --> 00:27.228
Exercise complete.

00:27.296 --> 00:30.665
As I suspected,
a stuffed bunny.

00:30.733 --> 00:32.467
Fine, but why didn't you
hit it with the stick?

00:32.534 --> 00:34.002
- What?
But--

00:34.070 --> 00:36.237
- We thought this was a test
of when to apply force, Skipper.

00:37.005 --> 00:38.806
Oh, it was.

00:40.242 --> 00:42.275
- Uh, how did you
get the crossbow inside the--

00:42.343 --> 00:44.344
- I know a guy in Havana.

00:44.412 --> 00:46.947
He doesn't ask questions,
and neither do I.

00:48.849 --> 00:49.816
Perimeter breach.

00:49.884 --> 00:51.017
Rico, man the bunny-bow.

00:52.553 --> 00:53.820
Sirs.

00:53.888 --> 00:56.990
Private Eggy
reporting for duty, sirs.

00:57.058 --> 00:58.826
Ah.

01:01.296 --> 01:02.263
Of course not.

01:03.332 --> 01:04.232
It's Eggy.

01:04.299 --> 01:05.933
You remember little Eggy.

01:06.001 --> 01:08.303
He's the adorable duckling
we took care of

01:08.370 --> 01:09.938
When he was just an egg.

01:10.006 --> 01:12.508
I got a bit nervous when
you all trained him so hard,

01:12.575 --> 01:15.011
But in the end, he hatched,
and everything was just--

01:15.079 --> 01:17.313
- No unauthorized flashbacks.

01:17.381 --> 01:19.550
He's cute. We have a history.
End of story.

01:19.617 --> 01:22.786
Oh, and what brings you
back to our lair,

01:22.854 --> 01:25.823
You kitchy-koochy--
oh, I just want to eat you up.

01:25.890 --> 01:27.524
Sweetie?
Are you down there?

01:27.592 --> 01:28.492
Too late.

01:28.560 --> 01:30.728
Blend and confuse, boys.

01:30.795 --> 01:34.831
- Excuse me, did my son--
there you are.

01:34.899 --> 01:38.502
Gah, my cover's blown,
but they'll never break me.

01:39.570 --> 01:41.238
So...How've you been?

01:41.306 --> 01:44.141
- You see this?
- Burmese cobra escape.

01:44.209 --> 01:45.977
Enemies sighted, Skipper.

01:47.613 --> 01:49.147
This is what he's been like

01:49.214 --> 01:51.282
Ever since your
egg-sitting adventure.

01:53.886 --> 01:57.488
There does seem to be a slight
uptick in zesty exuberance.

01:57.556 --> 01:59.123
"zesty exuberance"?

01:59.191 --> 02:00.858
My son is going to get hurt.

02:00.926 --> 02:02.360
Your mama's right, Eggy.

02:02.428 --> 02:04.663
We've had years of training
for what we do.

02:04.730 --> 02:07.532
A boy your age isn't ready
for field work.

02:07.600 --> 02:11.837
I told him that, but he says
my Intel is compromised.

02:11.904 --> 02:14.873
Who's pulling your strings,
mother?

02:14.940 --> 02:16.374
Give us till sundown.

02:16.442 --> 02:19.310
We'll get little danger britches
set straight.

02:19.378 --> 02:21.313
Thank you so much.

02:21.380 --> 02:23.649
Now listen to the penguins,
kiddo.

02:23.716 --> 02:26.652
All right, Eggy,
school's in session.

02:38.064 --> 02:39.665
And that was just to adjust

02:39.733 --> 02:41.367
Our drinking fountain
temperature.

02:41.435 --> 02:43.002
Yeah, the private
has a sensitive beak.

02:43.070 --> 02:45.972
Oh, I can't believe
you told him that.

02:46.040 --> 02:48.174
And a sensitive
everything else.

02:48.242 --> 02:49.175
Wow.

02:49.243 --> 02:51.644
That was amazing, sirs.

02:51.712 --> 02:54.447
Yes, the kind of amazing
you only get

02:54.515 --> 02:57.383
With discipline, practice,
being a penguin.

02:57.451 --> 03:01.454
Now I hope you've learned
a valuable something-or-other.

03:01.522 --> 03:03.623
Wouldn't a direct assault

03:03.690 --> 03:05.891
Take the enemy down faster?

03:05.959 --> 03:07.126
- Oh.
- Eggy, no.

03:11.631 --> 03:15.100
Sirs, mission accomplished
again...

03:15.168 --> 03:16.101
And faster.

03:16.169 --> 03:17.436
- How did you--

03:17.504 --> 03:20.739
- I learned everything
from you, sirs.

03:20.807 --> 03:22.508
Oh.

03:22.576 --> 03:24.443
No, not "oh."

03:24.511 --> 03:26.445
This is dangerous business,
eggy.

03:26.513 --> 03:28.748
I know.
Isn't it great?

03:28.815 --> 03:30.182
Can I have some dynamite?

03:30.250 --> 03:31.684
Okay.

03:31.752 --> 03:32.685
Rico, no.

03:35.088 --> 03:36.288
Hey.

03:36.356 --> 03:38.323
I meant this is dangerous
penguin business,

03:38.391 --> 03:40.825
And you are not ready,
period...

03:40.893 --> 03:42.894
Or possibly exclamation point.

03:42.962 --> 03:44.695
Kowalski, punctuation options.

03:44.763 --> 03:47.498
I suggest the Spanish inverted.

03:47.566 --> 03:48.799
<i>Muy fuerte.</i>

03:48.867 --> 03:51.801
But you saw my commando skills.

03:51.869 --> 03:54.370
How can you say
I'm not ready, sir?

03:54.438 --> 03:57.740
Well, because...

03:57.808 --> 04:00.275
Because you don't have this.

04:00.343 --> 04:02.210
A subway fare card?

04:02.278 --> 04:03.778
A license.

04:03.846 --> 04:06.315
An official
penguin commando license.

04:06.382 --> 04:08.250
No, no, I'm sure
that's a metro card.

04:08.318 --> 04:09.918
I can see the logo right--
oh!

04:09.986 --> 04:12.254
I didn't know
I needed a license.

04:12.322 --> 04:14.456
Of course.
We've all got ours.

04:14.524 --> 04:16.125
Oh, absolutely.

04:16.192 --> 04:17.192
Really?

04:17.260 --> 04:19.028
I don't have a--

04:19.096 --> 04:20.863
Oh, yes.

04:20.930 --> 04:22.966
Penguin commando license.

04:23.034 --> 04:24.334
Very important.

04:24.402 --> 04:26.570
And I'm winking
to indicate that.

04:26.638 --> 04:28.705
And they don't
come easy either.

04:28.773 --> 04:30.408
You've got to prove
you can tackle everything

04:30.475 --> 04:31.743
This zoo throws at you.

04:31.810 --> 04:32.844
Have you proven that, eggy?

04:32.911 --> 04:34.479
Uh-uh.

04:34.547 --> 04:37.115
Then I really don't think
you're ready for this.

04:37.183 --> 04:38.617
- But--

04:38.685 --> 04:40.286
You're right, sir.

04:40.354 --> 04:42.488
Private eggy
requesting permission

04:42.556 --> 04:44.757
To reapply when I'm ready.

04:44.825 --> 04:49.629
Permission granted,
you precocious ragamuffin.

04:49.697 --> 04:52.566
Well, I'd call that
mission accomplished.

04:52.633 --> 04:54.668
So what do we do
with the rest of our day?

04:54.735 --> 04:56.303
Ooh, we could get
temporary tattoos

04:56.371 --> 04:58.872
With motorcycle club nicknames.

05:00.675 --> 05:02.876
I'll be "Bobby thunderskull."

05:02.944 --> 05:04.410
All in favor of private's

05:04.478 --> 05:06.413
Tattoos and nicknames plan,
say--

05:10.317 --> 05:14.419
Oh, we should probably
do something about that.

05:14.487 --> 05:15.921
Fallen lemur, what happened?

05:15.988 --> 05:17.288
I don't know.

05:17.356 --> 05:19.624
Something came flying
out of nowhere, and wham.

05:19.691 --> 05:21.025
I'm flat on my butt.

05:21.093 --> 05:24.195
And I am left to apply
my own eye vegetables,

05:24.263 --> 05:26.130
Which is the real tragedy.

05:26.198 --> 05:27.832
Mort, weep for me.

05:27.900 --> 05:30.701
My eyes are exhausted
from all the cucumbering.

05:34.307 --> 05:37.542
My eye vegetables are burny.

05:37.610 --> 05:39.978
Can you give us any details
on your attacker?

05:40.046 --> 05:42.214
I didn't see him,
but it sounded kind of like...

05:42.282 --> 05:43.448
A kid.

05:46.119 --> 05:47.119
Ouchies.

05:47.187 --> 05:48.687
Victory from above.

05:48.755 --> 05:49.722
- Whoa there.
- Got ya.

05:49.790 --> 05:51.691
Eggy, what are you doing?

05:51.758 --> 05:52.925
Huh, eggy?

05:52.993 --> 05:55.395
You mean this is my J.J.,

05:55.463 --> 05:57.597
Who I raised
as a little lemur egg

05:57.665 --> 05:59.633
To be a mighty lemur prince?

05:59.701 --> 06:01.101
♪ me and my J.J. ♪

06:01.169 --> 06:02.569
♪ with me he will stay ♪

06:02.637 --> 06:03.737
♪ and then we ♪

06:03.805 --> 06:06.106
Great, now that's in my head
all day.

06:06.174 --> 06:08.442
Sirs, you said I had to prove

06:08.510 --> 06:10.811
I could tackle everything
in the zoo.

06:10.879 --> 06:15.249
By my count, that's two animals
tackled already.

06:15.317 --> 06:17.452
I could get my license
by sundown.

06:17.519 --> 06:20.721
- Yeah, looks like--
what?

06:20.789 --> 06:23.424
We live by a code of honor,
sir.

06:23.491 --> 06:26.894
And you promised.

06:26.961 --> 06:27.894
Hooah.

06:27.962 --> 06:28.929
Don't, eggy.

06:28.996 --> 06:30.630
This won't prove anything.

06:30.698 --> 06:32.432
Of course it will.

06:32.499 --> 06:34.366
Go, J.J.
Do it.

06:36.136 --> 06:37.202
Hold on.

06:37.270 --> 06:38.670
This may be perfect.

06:38.738 --> 06:40.272
But that's
the elephant habitat.

06:40.339 --> 06:41.706
Exactamente.

06:41.774 --> 06:44.176
One-on-one with the world's
largest land mammal.

06:44.243 --> 06:47.278
Why I'd have trouble
taking big Grey down myself.

06:47.346 --> 06:49.881
Probably have to pull out
my signature moves.

06:49.949 --> 06:51.482
Start with the tangiers
trunk swing,

06:51.550 --> 06:53.484
Then a Kyoto tail whip

06:53.552 --> 06:56.754
Into a pair
of Marrakesh kneecappers.

06:56.822 --> 06:58.757
Ha-sha.

06:58.824 --> 07:01.426
Wait a minute, why are you all
staring behind me

07:01.494 --> 07:05.931
As if fixated on something
I'm heretofore oblivious to?

07:10.370 --> 07:13.438
But those were
my signature moves.

07:13.506 --> 07:14.373
<i>My signature.</i>

07:14.441 --> 07:16.441
Oh, dear golly.

07:16.509 --> 07:18.844
Eggy said he learned
everything from us.

07:18.912 --> 07:21.480
That may be more true
than we realized.

07:21.548 --> 07:24.849
The egg state is a time
of intense knowledge absorption.

07:24.917 --> 07:27.219
If each of us gave him
our best training,

07:27.286 --> 07:31.523
Then eggy must possess all
of our strengths combined.

07:31.591 --> 07:32.858
Uh, what?

07:32.925 --> 07:35.793
He's an unstoppable
commando machine.

07:35.861 --> 07:38.363
See?
Now, that's a helpful flashback.

07:38.431 --> 07:39.698
Follow that duckling.

07:43.336 --> 07:45.271
All right. Banana.

07:45.339 --> 07:47.908
Yo, I'm totally gonna
grab that.

07:54.950 --> 07:57.118
He's got my knowledge
of physics.

07:57.186 --> 07:59.054
Ah, a bad boy, eh?

07:59.122 --> 08:01.957
Maybe Joey needs to give you
a proper spanking.

08:05.094 --> 08:06.929
He's got Rico's
psychotic instinct.

08:10.166 --> 08:12.034
Beg your pardon, miss.

08:12.101 --> 08:14.203
Might I trouble you
to lean down a spot?

08:14.270 --> 08:16.238
- Of course, you adorable--

08:17.340 --> 08:18.774
Cheerio.

08:18.842 --> 08:21.343
He's putting on an adorably
phony British accent.

08:21.411 --> 08:23.111
Just like the private.

08:23.179 --> 08:24.145
Phony?

08:24.213 --> 08:25.580
This is how I really talk.

08:25.648 --> 08:28.183
Sure it is, gov'na.

08:28.251 --> 08:31.253
Chameleons.

08:31.320 --> 08:32.754
Rhino.

08:32.822 --> 08:34.889
Flamingo.

08:34.957 --> 08:38.158
Over 92.7% of the zoo
has already gone down.

08:38.226 --> 08:40.193
Don't give me statistics, man.

08:40.260 --> 08:41.727
Tell me who isn't down.

08:41.796 --> 08:43.363
Well, there's the four of us.

08:44.799 --> 08:46.233
Three of us.

08:46.301 --> 08:47.634
Two of us.

08:47.702 --> 08:50.938
Okay, that leaves just--

08:51.005 --> 08:52.039
Right.

08:52.107 --> 08:53.941
Then the only zoo animal
left is...

08:54.008 --> 08:55.676
Oh, boy.

08:55.744 --> 08:57.644
Hey Maurice, check out
my new shirt.

08:57.712 --> 08:59.846
I don't usually wear one,
I know,

08:59.914 --> 09:01.915
But these circles
are pretty sweet, eh?

09:01.983 --> 09:03.217
Ringtail, focus.

09:03.285 --> 09:04.451
We need your help.

09:04.519 --> 09:07.154
And why would I help you
to not prove

09:07.222 --> 09:09.957
That my J.J. Is
the bestest tackler?

09:10.024 --> 09:12.025
If eggy thinks
he has a commando license,

09:12.093 --> 09:14.962
Who knows what kind of danger
he'll throw himself into?

09:15.029 --> 09:17.731
Plus, we'll have
to actually make licenses.

09:17.799 --> 09:20.300
This isn't just about tackling.

09:21.603 --> 09:23.003
Excelante.

09:23.070 --> 09:26.205
Come on, commando license.

09:26.273 --> 09:29.375
I want to fight some ninjas
in a chainsaw factory.

09:30.711 --> 09:33.379
You know, that does sound
slightly unsafe.

09:33.447 --> 09:34.414
Ringtail, run.

09:37.484 --> 09:38.384
It's too late.

09:38.451 --> 09:39.952
Eggy's locked on.

09:40.020 --> 09:42.789
Well, at least this proves
our training is effective.

09:42.856 --> 09:45.592
That duck is going to make
one heck of a penguin.

09:45.659 --> 09:47.060
What?

09:47.127 --> 09:50.663
My J.J. Wants to be a penguin?

09:50.731 --> 09:55.935
Have you not seen what
this kingly booty can do?

09:56.003 --> 09:57.170
Five, six, seven, eight.

10:03.011 --> 10:04.944
How do you like that low there?

10:05.012 --> 10:06.513
Wow.

10:06.580 --> 10:08.381
Julien's actually doing it.

10:08.449 --> 10:11.284
Eggy can't tackle everything
in this zoo after all.

10:11.351 --> 10:13.586
Can't... Tackle...

10:17.458 --> 10:20.526
You, sir, are the greatest...

10:20.594 --> 10:23.596
Of all animals.

10:23.664 --> 10:27.467
- But you can
be the second-greatest.

10:27.535 --> 10:31.138
Come, let us begin your
booty shaking training.

10:31.206 --> 10:33.840
Ooh, dancing.

10:33.908 --> 10:35.542

10:35.610 --> 10:37.511
You cured my baby.

10:37.578 --> 10:39.480
Yes, we can definitely state
that your child

10:39.547 --> 10:41.782
No longer wants to be a penguin,

10:41.849 --> 10:44.417
And may the world forgive us.

10:44.485 --> 10:46.687
Okay, little dancer,

10:46.754 --> 10:48.322

15:32.143 --> 15:34.043
