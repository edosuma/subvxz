Laney?

12:22.654 --> 12:23.612
[crying softly]

12:23.655 --> 12:24.874
Hey, Laney?

12:26.093 --> 12:27.050
Corporal!

12:27.094 --> 12:28.138
Yes, sir.

12:28.182 --> 12:29.792
Did you kill
Joe Cortez?

12:30.880 --> 12:32.273
Maybe.

12:33.753 --> 12:34.841
Maybe?

12:34.884 --> 12:38.235
I'm looking at the same evidence
you are.

12:38.279 --> 12:40.150
And, to be honest,

12:40.194 --> 12:44.154
I don't remember anything
after I spoke to Dr. Pershing.

12:44.198 --> 12:46.940
Is that who prescribed you
all those sleeping pills?

12:46.983 --> 12:49.290
No, he's my therapist.

12:49.333 --> 12:51.248
My hypnotherapist. Uh...

12:51.292 --> 12:55.949
He says he can help me go
to sleep without all the drugs.

12:55.992 --> 12:57.733
He says I'm...

12:57.777 --> 12:59.343
a great subject.SLOANE: Did he,

12:59.387 --> 13:01.432
by any chance,
hypnotize you last night?

13:03.347 --> 13:06.394
Yes. We had
a video chat session.

13:06.437 --> 13:08.265
One second, I'm...

13:08.309 --> 13:11.355
counting back, and...

13:11.399 --> 13:14.837
next thing I know, it's morning.

13:14.881 --> 13:18.232
I thought
that I slept through the night.

13:19.624 --> 13:22.105
But what if I didn't?

13:22.149 --> 13:23.585
SLOANE:
Are you suggesting

13:23.628 --> 13:27.676
you might have shot Joe Cortez
while under hypnosis?

13:31.680 --> 13:34.248
I need you to believe me.

13:35.292 --> 13:38.687
I would never murder anyone.

13:40.254 --> 13:42.865
But if I did,

13:42.909 --> 13:46.695
Dr. Pershing
must have made me do it.

13:57.575 --> 13:59.055
Hypno-homicide?

13:59.099 --> 14:01.057
Hard to believe that you
could hypnotize someone

14:01.101 --> 14:02.319
to commit a murder.

14:02.363 --> 14:03.886
But Sloane seems
pretty adamant

14:03.930 --> 14:06.410
that you meet
this new expert she found.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.587
Oh, hi, Popeye.

14:09.631 --> 14:11.328
Dr. Grace. Nice to see you.

14:11.372 --> 14:12.852
Good to see you, too, Tim.

14:12.895 --> 14:14.331
Imagine my surprise

14:14.375 --> 14:15.376
when Jack called,

14:15.419 --> 14:17.334
asking if I knew
any certified

14:17.378 --> 14:18.509
hypnotherapists.

14:18.553 --> 14:21.338
Turns out I do.

14:21.382 --> 14:23.036
SLOANE:
Just hear her out,

14:23.079 --> 14:24.341
Gibbs.

14:24.385 --> 14:26.126
Hypnosis has been

14:26.169 --> 14:28.302
a grossly misrepresented
phenomenon,

14:28.345 --> 14:30.739
so Grace is here to help you,

14:30.782 --> 14:33.176
you know, understand.Understand what?

14:33.220 --> 14:34.917
I should get back.No, no, no, no.

14:34.961 --> 14:36.049
Tim, please, stay.

14:36.092 --> 14:37.615
You're the only
one on the team

14:37.659 --> 14:39.226
who's been hypnotized before.
I need you.Well, that was--

14:39.269 --> 14:40.836
that was a long time ago.
I was...

14:40.880 --> 14:43.447
trying to remember the details
of a murder I witnessed.

14:43.491 --> 14:46.537
And as I understand it, it
worked and you caught the guy?

14:46.581 --> 14:48.365
Oh, come on, Doc.Gibbs,

14:48.409 --> 14:51.238
hypnosis is nothing more than
a state of focused attention,

14:51.281 --> 14:53.370
where a subject
is highly suggestible.

14:53.414 --> 14:57.026
That's why hypnotherapists
can help people quit smoking,

14:57.070 --> 15:00.421
conquer phobias, beat insomnia.

15:00.464 --> 15:02.423
We're not talking
about insomnia, Doc.

15:02.466 --> 15:04.381
Look, I get it.
You don't believe

15:04.425 --> 15:07.036
that anyone could convince
a law-abiding person

15:07.080 --> 15:08.951
to shoot someone.

15:08.995 --> 15:10.692
But a hypnotist

15:10.735 --> 15:14.043
can change a subject's
perception of reality.

15:14.087 --> 15:15.479
SLOANE:
That's right.
For example,

15:15.523 --> 15:18.482
one could create
an imaginative scene

15:18.526 --> 15:21.485
where that same
law-abiding person

15:21.529 --> 15:23.139
must shoot a bear

15:23.183 --> 15:25.533
that is attacking
to save their child.

15:25.576 --> 15:26.490
You know what I mean?

15:28.492 --> 15:30.973
No? Okay, Grace,

15:31.017 --> 15:34.324
maybe it would be helpful
if you could demonstrateA bear?

15:34.368 --> 15:35.412
hypnosis for us.

15:35.456 --> 15:36.370
What a great idea.

15:36.413 --> 15:38.372
All I need is a subject.

15:39.329 --> 15:40.330
Hey, McGee.

15:40.374 --> 15:42.202
Sorry, what?

15:42.245 --> 15:43.507
Ah. Hey, Gibbs.

15:43.551 --> 15:45.814
Uh, we tracked down
Laney's hypnotherapist.

15:45.857 --> 15:47.424
Took two of you
to tell me that?

15:47.468 --> 15:48.599
Well, maybe we heard
that someone

15:48.643 --> 15:49.818
was being hypnotized in here.

15:49.861 --> 15:50.819
Did we miss it?

15:50.862 --> 15:52.516
McGee, come on.Wait.

15:52.560 --> 15:55.084
I wish he could've stayed
for the demo.

15:55.128 --> 15:56.956
Mm.Mm.
Mm.

15:56.999 --> 15:58.392
Mm.Oh!

15:58.435 --> 15:59.523
Oh. No.

somebody's voodoo doll.

16:03.136 --> 16:04.441
What about you, Ellie?

16:04.485 --> 16:05.747
Come on, Jack. I mean,
you really believe

16:05.790 --> 16:08.010
Corporal Alimonte was
hypnotized to kill?

16:08.054 --> 16:10.012
I don't know
what to believe.

16:10.056 --> 16:11.883
That's why I need to see
with my own eyes

16:11.927 --> 16:13.885
what a hypnotist can
and cannot do.Mm.

16:13.929 --> 16:17.019
And you know what, Ellie?
Skeptics make the best subjects.

Fine. I'm in.

16:45.178 --> 16:46.918
You have to activate
the red light.

16:46.962 --> 16:49.443
To let Dr. Pershing know
you're here.

16:49.486 --> 16:51.445
Got it, boss.

17:02.978 --> 17:03.935
Yes.

to stop now.

17:15.904 --> 17:17.993
you're going to wake up.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.430

17:20.474 --> 17:21.997

her last night?

Yes.

Why?In addition

with crippling insomnia.

18:14.354 --> 18:16.007
I was trying to help her sleep.

18:16.051 --> 18:17.792
You suggest anything to her
other than sleep?

18:17.835 --> 18:19.924

18:19.968 --> 18:21.317
Actually, yes.

18:21.361 --> 18:23.319
I told she should call me
the minute she woke up.

18:23.363 --> 18:24.755
Which she did.

18:24.799 --> 18:26.017

18:28.150 --> 18:30.021
But she is doing better
than Joe Cortez.

18:30.065 --> 18:31.806
Okay, I give up.
Who is that?

18:31.849 --> 18:33.721
That's the guy
she killed this morning.

but she's no killer.

That's what she said.

of forcing her to do it.

It's hard enough to get a person
to quit smoking, for God's sake.

18:57.266 --> 18:59.964
I certainly can't force someone
to commit a crime.

19:00.008 --> 19:02.402

Hey, Gibbs.
I'm starting to think

20:25.311 --> 20:26.921
the hypno-homicide theory may be

20:26.964 --> 20:29.010
a little bit more legit

Ha.I know. I know.

22:14.028 --> 22:17.684
My ex had custody for the
first half of his life, and...

22:17.727 --> 22:21.035
well, let's just say manners
weren't a big part of it.

22:21.078 --> 22:22.558
Sorry.

22:22.602 --> 22:24.255
Yeah.

22:24.299 --> 22:26.257
Have a nice night.

22:26.301 --> 22:27.128
Uh, wait.

22:27.171 --> 22:29.260
Who are you?

22:29.304 --> 22:31.045
Uh... Jethro Gibbs.

22:31.088 --> 22:32.568
I live across the street.

22:32.612 --> 22:34.396
Ah.
Phineas...

22:34.440 --> 22:37.399
introduced himself to me
this morning.

22:38.661 --> 22:40.620
He broke your window, didn't he?

22:40.663 --> 22:43.405
It's already fixed.This is his second
one this week.

22:43.449 --> 22:46.408
Boys at his new school, they
all play baseball during recess

22:46.452 --> 22:48.802
and he's decided
he wants to learn.

22:48.845 --> 22:51.152
Yeah, well,
we can all use

22:51.195 --> 22:53.502
a little practice.I wish I could help him,

22:53.546 --> 22:57.811
but with my two jobs and his dad
out of the picture...

22:57.854 --> 23:00.422
This is $3.50.

23:00.466 --> 23:02.337
His lunch money.

23:02.381 --> 23:05.253
Well, um, thank
you for...

23:05.296 --> 23:07.473
I don't know,
not being a jerk.

23:07.516 --> 23:09.388
It's tough being
the new kid.

23:11.346 --> 23:12.913
He's a southpaw, huh?

23:12.956 --> 23:14.697
Left hand?Oh, uh, no,

23:14.741 --> 23:16.743
he's, um, right-handed. Why?

23:16.786 --> 23:18.092
Hmm.

23:19.746 --> 23:21.269
Nothing.

23:21.312 --> 23:23.053
Uh, nice meeting you.

23:26.622 --> 23:28.407
Phineas. See you.

23:32.498 --> 23:35.196
BISHOP:
This is the lamest
social media profile

23:35.239 --> 23:36.458
I have ever seen.

23:36.502 --> 23:38.634
Yeah. But look how
many leads we got.

23:38.678 --> 23:40.984
That therapist lived
in Florida, Georgia,

23:41.028 --> 23:43.552
Alabama, South Carolina
and North Carolina.

23:43.596 --> 23:45.641
And Kasie even tracked
him down in Missouri

23:45.685 --> 23:47.251
12 years ago.

23:47.295 --> 23:48.862
Hmm...What?

23:48.905 --> 23:50.777
Nothing. We've just
been doing this for hours,

23:50.820 --> 23:52.300
and we've got zilch.

23:52.343 --> 23:53.823
I mean, I am...

23:53.867 --> 23:56.043
frustrated,
hungry and cross-eyed.

23:56.086 --> 23:57.479
Aren't you tired?

23:57.523 --> 23:58.741
Nope. I'm ready to go.

23:58.785 --> 24:00.569
Grace said I would
wake up, uh...

24:00.613 --> 24:02.441
you know, energized
and refreshed,

24:02.484 --> 24:03.746
and I did.

24:03.790 --> 24:06.575
Hypnosis is
the bomb, baby.

24:08.708 --> 24:11.101
What the hell?
I lost my blade.

24:11.145 --> 24:13.321
No, you didn't lose it.

24:13.364 --> 24:14.844
[opens drawer]You...

24:14.888 --> 24:16.498
gave it to me...

24:16.542 --> 24:17.934
while you were under.

24:17.978 --> 24:20.110
Nobody touches
my blade.

24:20.154 --> 24:23.374
And that is why Sloane had Grace
ask you to give it to me.

24:23.418 --> 24:24.506
To demonstrate.Demonstrate what?

24:24.550 --> 24:25.986
That you could be influenced

24:26.029 --> 24:27.857
to do something that
you wouldn't normally do.

24:27.901 --> 24:29.380
That's so not cool.

24:29.424 --> 24:31.165
[laughs]Wait.

24:31.208 --> 24:34.473
What... what else did I do
that I normally wouldn't do?

24:34.516 --> 24:36.475
Okay, hold on,
wait, wait, wait.

24:36.518 --> 24:37.911
Wait a minute.
Time out.

24:37.954 --> 24:39.913
Did I do
something else?

24:39.956 --> 24:41.871
Got something!
Somebody give me the clicker.

24:41.915 --> 24:42.785
I'm ready to click.

24:42.829 --> 24:44.874
Missouri came through.

24:44.918 --> 24:45.919
St. Louis.

24:45.962 --> 24:47.660
2007. College kid steals

24:47.703 --> 24:49.792
a case of beer
from a convenience store.

24:49.836 --> 24:51.751
He tells cops his roommate

24:51.794 --> 24:54.536
"hypnotically"
forced him to do it.

24:54.580 --> 24:55.755
Cops don't believe him.

24:55.798 --> 24:57.191
Charge him with a misdemeanor.

24:57.234 --> 24:58.801
He pays a fine. Hey...

24:58.845 --> 25:00.542
Bob's your uncle.

25:00.586 --> 25:01.587
My uncle's name
is Jeffrey.

25:01.630 --> 25:03.153
Francisco Javier.

25:03.197 --> 25:04.720
It's an expression. Look.

25:04.764 --> 25:06.026
The police report contained

25:06.069 --> 25:07.897
a surveillance image
of the robbery.

25:07.941 --> 25:10.465
That's the thief with the beer
getting into the car, but look

25:10.509 --> 25:12.293
who's driving.

25:12.336 --> 25:14.425
Is that Dr. Pershing?

25:14.469 --> 25:15.688
12 years younger,
but... yeah.

25:15.731 --> 25:17.690
Wait, he told Gibbs
that hypnotizing someone

25:17.733 --> 25:19.692
to commit a crime
was impossible.

25:19.735 --> 25:20.649
He lied.

25:21.694 --> 25:23.739
What else did he lie about?

25:30.267 --> 25:32.922
You're taking lead in
the interrogation, yeah?

25:32.966 --> 25:34.533
Yeah, you're taking lead.

25:34.576 --> 25:36.056
You got a problem, Torres?

25:36.099 --> 25:36.926
Uh, wha-- No.

25:36.970 --> 25:38.624
What? No problem, no.

25:38.667 --> 25:40.539
He's not gonna hypnotize you.

25:40.582 --> 25:41.540
[high-pitched]:
What?

25:41.583 --> 25:43.150
No. [stammers]

25:43.193 --> 25:45.326
Oh, you think I'm worried
that this guy's gonna hyp...

25:45.369 --> 25:46.762
hypno...
[clears throat]

25:46.806 --> 25:48.459
No. No, I'm cool.

25:48.503 --> 25:49.852
Cool.

25:50.853 --> 25:52.115
Cool.

25:52.159 --> 25:54.030
All right, let's do this.

25:55.075 --> 25:57.947
Whoa, whoa, what...
what the hell is this?

25:57.991 --> 25:59.949
It's an interrogation.

25:59.993 --> 26:01.560
For what?
I didn't do anything.

26:01.603 --> 26:03.474
Well, you lied
to federal agents.

26:03.518 --> 26:06.086
No, I most definitely
did not do that.You said

26:06.129 --> 26:07.914
you can't hypnotize someone
to commit a crime.

26:07.957 --> 26:08.915
You can't.Well,

26:08.958 --> 26:10.003
your college roommate says

26:10.046 --> 26:11.700
you did exactly that.

26:12.919 --> 26:14.834
What?You want to change
your story,

26:14.877 --> 26:15.965
Doctor?

26:16.009 --> 26:18.141
Okay, you
can't really think that...

26:18.185 --> 26:20.666
This was 12 years ago.

26:21.797 --> 26:24.626
[exhales]
Okay, I...

26:24.670 --> 26:27.150
I was just learning hypnosis.

26:27.194 --> 26:29.892
I needed to practice,
so I tried it out

26:29.936 --> 26:32.329
on my willingroommate.You told him

26:32.373 --> 26:33.679
to rob a liquor store.Well, he just

26:33.722 --> 26:35.985
used me as an excuse
once the cops busted him.

26:36.029 --> 26:37.378
Would he have robbed
that liquor store

26:37.421 --> 26:39.293
if you didn't hypnotize him?All this proves

26:39.336 --> 26:41.556
is that my roommate
really wanted some beer.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.993
It was easy to influence him
to steal it.

26:44.037 --> 26:45.125
Corporal Alimonte.

26:45.168 --> 26:46.779
Was she easy to influence, too?

26:46.822 --> 26:49.129
Okay, if Laney killed someone,

26:49.172 --> 26:51.784
that was her idea, not mine.

26:51.827 --> 26:54.395
Yeah, but you said
she wasn't homicidal.Yes, but she doesn't sleep,

26:54.438 --> 26:56.310
she loses time--
maybe she snapped

26:56.353 --> 26:58.617
and repressed the memory.Well, maybe you

26:58.660 --> 27:00.967
hypnotized her into thinking
she had to shoot a bear

27:01.010 --> 27:04.013
to protect herself.And by "bear," he
means Joe Cortez.

27:04.057 --> 27:05.972
I still don't know who that is.

27:11.020 --> 27:12.413
Um...

27:12.456 --> 27:14.197
I want a lawyer.

27:14.241 --> 27:16.025
[voice cracks]:
Now.

27:19.246 --> 27:20.595
Whoa, what are you doing?

27:20.639 --> 27:21.901
You're-you're gonna stay here?

27:21.944 --> 27:23.119
[clears throat]

27:23.163 --> 27:25.687
You, um... Okay, you're leaving.

27:29.082 --> 27:30.779
[sighs]

27:30.823 --> 27:32.433
Well?

27:32.476 --> 27:35.828
What do you think?I think we
are not going to turn

27:35.871 --> 27:38.221
200 years of murder statute
upside down

27:38.265 --> 27:40.833
by charging a hypnotist
with homicide.

27:40.876 --> 27:43.096
Last time I checked,
The Manchurian Candidate

27:43.139 --> 27:44.924
was just a movie, right?

27:44.967 --> 27:46.621
Right?

27:46.665 --> 27:49.972
Sometimes life
imitates art, Director.

27:50.016 --> 27:53.628
The evidence says Corporal
Alimonte pulled the trigger.

27:53.672 --> 27:56.283
Yes, but what if he
convinced her to do it?Come on,

27:56.326 --> 27:57.458
Jack.Look.

27:57.501 --> 27:59.068
We already have him on record

27:59.112 --> 28:00.983
hypnotizing oneperson
to commit a crime.

28:01.027 --> 28:04.204
Yeah, but stealing beer is not
the same as committing murder.

28:04.247 --> 28:06.423
Help me out here, Dr. Grace.

28:06.467 --> 28:07.990
Do you believe
in mind-control murder?

28:08.034 --> 28:10.384
Here's what I'll say.
If a corrupt hypnotist

28:10.427 --> 28:14.170
spent months building trust
with the right patient,

28:14.214 --> 28:17.565
used multilayered suggestions
and embedded commands

28:17.608 --> 28:19.349
over the course
of many sessions,

28:19.393 --> 28:21.308
there's a greater-
than-zero chance

28:21.351 --> 28:23.223
that someone ends up dead.

28:24.267 --> 28:25.791
If this happened--

28:25.834 --> 28:27.749
and that is a gigantic if--

28:27.793 --> 28:29.795
how would we even prove it?

28:29.838 --> 28:31.187
I don't know.

28:31.231 --> 28:34.277
It's literally
the perfect murder.

28:36.715 --> 28:38.107
Dr. Pershing's lawyer?

28:38.151 --> 28:40.022
Yep. And the way
this is going,

28:40.066 --> 28:41.763
he's gonna need one.

28:41.807 --> 28:43.199
What? You, too?

28:43.243 --> 28:45.027
I-I thought you were
in Camp Skeptics with me.

28:45.071 --> 28:46.812
I was, until yesterday,

28:46.855 --> 28:49.205
when I saw Torres eat
an entire apple fritter.

28:49.249 --> 28:51.207
What?Grace hypnotized him,

28:51.251 --> 28:54.167
told him it was
a protein bar.And he believed it?

28:54.210 --> 28:56.778
That is what I'm saying, McGee--
if a hypnotist can alter

28:56.822 --> 28:59.085
someone's perception
of reality that much,

28:59.128 --> 29:01.130
who knows how far it could go?

29:01.174 --> 29:02.653
Okay, you're telling me
that-that

29:02.697 --> 29:04.220
Mr. Muscle Boy took a doughnut,

29:04.264 --> 29:06.005
put it in his mouth
and chewed it?

29:06.048 --> 29:07.093
I would have loved
to have seen that.

29:07.136 --> 29:08.659
That is why I
took a picture.

29:08.703 --> 29:10.183
Picture of what?

29:10.226 --> 29:12.359
A picture of...
motive, boss.

29:12.402 --> 29:14.491
We-we still
can't find any.

29:14.535 --> 29:16.319
I mean, even if we assume

29:16.363 --> 29:18.104
that Dr. Pershing was
able to hypnotize

29:18.147 --> 29:21.063
Corporal Alimonte into
committing a murder for him,

29:21.107 --> 29:24.066
we still don't have a motive.That cuts both ways.

29:24.110 --> 29:25.764
As far as we know,

29:25.807 --> 29:28.244
Corporal Alimonte and our
victim are complete strangers.

29:28.288 --> 29:31.073
There's no connection
so no motive, either.She shot him in the heart.

29:31.117 --> 29:32.509
There's a connection.McGee,

29:32.553 --> 29:34.381
does she really seem
capable of murder?

29:34.424 --> 29:36.165
Without being
hypnotized?Enough!

29:36.209 --> 29:38.864
You talk to her C.O. yet?He, uh, returned

29:38.907 --> 29:40.082
to Quantico about an hour ago.

29:40.126 --> 29:41.257
Go!

29:41.301 --> 29:43.259
Both of you.
Go fight in the car.

29:43.303 --> 29:45.784
Uh, did you
go shopping?

29:45.827 --> 29:47.916
Like, a shopping mall?

29:49.352 --> 29:51.528
Did Dr. Grace hypnotize you?

29:52.573 --> 29:53.922
Quantico!

29:53.966 --> 29:55.619
On my way.

30:07.806 --> 30:10.809
Corporal Alimonte worked by my
side through two duty stations.

30:10.852 --> 30:13.202
She was an invaluable
asset to the Corps.

30:13.246 --> 30:15.944
So invaluable
you're discharging her?

30:15.988 --> 30:18.338
Wasn't my
decision, ma'am.

30:18.381 --> 30:19.121
But it was the right one.

30:19.165 --> 30:20.340
So, what happened?

30:20.383 --> 30:22.951
[sighs]
You know about her insomnia?

30:22.995 --> 30:24.518
So I tried to be
accommodating.

30:24.561 --> 30:26.259
Little mistakes, I'd overlook,

30:26.302 --> 30:28.000
but... they got bigger.

30:28.043 --> 30:29.697
So you recommended
a medical exam.Yes, sir.

30:29.740 --> 30:31.830
But she got worse, not better.

30:31.873 --> 30:33.875
And last week
I found her catatonic,

30:33.919 --> 30:36.051
shoving scissors into that wall.

30:36.095 --> 30:39.141
I intervened,
and she...

30:39.185 --> 30:40.316
threatened me.

30:40.360 --> 30:42.057
So you wrote her up
for office hours.

30:42.101 --> 30:43.493
Correct.

30:43.537 --> 30:45.626
When the captain heard
what happened...

30:45.669 --> 30:47.497
he put her on limited duty

30:47.541 --> 30:50.196
and recommended
the OTH discharge.Back to the threat.

30:50.239 --> 30:52.067
What... what exactly
did she say to you?

30:52.111 --> 30:53.547
Didn't say anything.

30:53.590 --> 30:55.331
She came after me
with those scissors.

30:58.595 --> 31:00.597
[lullaby playing softly]

31:13.219 --> 31:16.048
SLOANE [distorted, echoing]:
Laney?

31:16.091 --> 31:18.659
Laney?

31:18.702 --> 31:19.921
Laney.

31:22.358 --> 31:24.056
Hey, Laney?

31:25.840 --> 31:27.886
Can you hear me?

31:33.369 --> 31:35.328
Agent Sloane.

31:35.371 --> 31:37.112
Are you okay?

31:37.156 --> 31:39.462
I don't know.

31:39.506 --> 31:43.466
Did you get any sleep
at all last night?

31:46.992 --> 31:49.124
[inhales sharply]

31:49.168 --> 31:53.563
I kept thinking
about Tracey's orchid.

31:55.087 --> 31:57.654
Tracey's my neighbor;
she's on vacation.

31:57.698 --> 32:00.919
I told her I would water it.

32:00.962 --> 32:03.791
It's beautiful.

32:03.834 --> 32:06.750
Purple flowers
but it's very delicate

32:06.794 --> 32:09.014
and I have to remember
to water it tonight.

32:09.057 --> 32:11.886
I don't think you're gonna be
going home tonight, Laney.

32:15.934 --> 32:17.979
Maybe you could water it?

32:19.241 --> 32:21.113
I know that you have insomnia.

32:21.156 --> 32:24.638
But I think there's something
else going on with you.

32:24.681 --> 32:26.770
Something only
a medical doctor can diagnose,

32:26.814 --> 32:28.990
not a hypnotherapist.

32:29.034 --> 32:32.211
Speaking of Dr. Pershing,
he claims, unsurprisingly,

32:32.254 --> 32:33.864
that he did not ask you
to kill anyone.

32:33.908 --> 32:36.563
But without evidence
to the contrary,

32:36.606 --> 32:39.044
and your fingerprints
on the gun...

32:39.087 --> 32:42.003
Have you thought
any more about that night

32:42.047 --> 32:43.874
he hypnotized you?

32:43.918 --> 32:46.007
Did he do or say
anything unusual?

32:46.051 --> 32:50.490
The man who died...

32:50.533 --> 32:53.014
Did he have a family?

32:53.058 --> 32:55.669
Uh, yeah.

32:58.063 --> 33:00.761
Can you tell them
that I'm sorry?

33:01.892 --> 33:03.198
I don't remember what happened

33:03.242 --> 33:04.852
but that I'm sorry.

33:06.723 --> 33:08.987
You believe me, right?

33:11.511 --> 33:13.730
Yeah, I do.

33:20.607 --> 33:22.478
We've got
a ginormous problem,

33:22.522 --> 33:24.089
which is why
I called you right away,

33:24.132 --> 33:25.916
so you can see it right away,

33:25.960 --> 33:28.093
so that you can
do something right away.

33:28.136 --> 33:29.529
The murder weapon

33:29.572 --> 33:31.792
with Laney's fingerprints
on the grip.

33:31.835 --> 33:33.185
I've highlighted them
so you can see.

33:33.228 --> 33:34.534
Yeah, I see.

33:34.577 --> 33:35.622
KASIE:
Three fingerprints

33:35.665 --> 33:36.840
on the left side of the grip,

33:36.884 --> 33:38.059
a partial thumbprint
above them,

33:38.103 --> 33:40.583
which leaves one finger
for the trigger.

33:40.627 --> 33:42.063
It's a normal pattern.

33:42.107 --> 33:43.847
With one abnormal distinction,

33:43.891 --> 33:45.023
which I noticed
when I was

33:45.066 --> 33:47.025
scanning the prints
for evidence archives.

33:47.068 --> 33:49.897
The print of her ring finger
is backwards,

33:49.940 --> 33:52.508
as if she's holding
the murder weapon like this.

33:52.552 --> 33:55.903
Which is physiologically
impossible.

33:55.946 --> 33:58.210
So either she's got
a really weird

33:58.253 --> 34:00.516
fingerprint
birth defect or...

34:00.560 --> 34:02.127
Someone planted her
fingerprints on the weapon.

34:02.170 --> 34:03.780
Gibbs, we've got a problem.

34:03.824 --> 34:05.434
Yeah, we do.

34:05.478 --> 34:09.090
Laney is at risk
for anaphylaxis.

34:09.134 --> 34:10.613
Right, you're not a doctor.

34:10.657 --> 34:12.224
Uh, I-I was just, uh,

34:12.267 --> 34:14.095
reviewing Laney's
medical records, and--

34:14.139 --> 34:15.531
Actually, Kasie,
your thoroughness

34:15.575 --> 34:18.099
with the ballistics test
really inspired me.

34:18.143 --> 34:19.274
Palmer!Sorry.

34:19.318 --> 34:21.102
Uh, anaphylaxis is

34:21.146 --> 34:22.712
a very serious allergic reaction

34:22.756 --> 34:24.279
that sometimes results in...Skip to the end.

34:24.323 --> 34:28.849
Corporal Alimonte
is allergic to peanuts.

34:28.892 --> 34:30.677
But they were all
over the crime scene.Exactly.

34:30.720 --> 34:32.070
And her condition is so severe,

34:32.113 --> 34:34.115
that if she'd even
walked into that house...

34:34.159 --> 34:35.247
She wouldn't have walked out.

34:35.290 --> 34:37.075
Laney didn't kill Joe Cortez.

34:37.118 --> 34:39.077
She was framed.

34:45.866 --> 34:47.346
TORRES:
Well, we still have
a murder victim.

34:47.389 --> 34:48.738
But we lost our murderer.

34:48.782 --> 34:50.436
McGEE:
Actually, we've got
two victims now.

34:50.479 --> 34:52.351
Someone tried
to frame Laney.

34:52.394 --> 34:53.917
Can't arrest
a "someone."

34:53.961 --> 34:55.919
Well, you can narrow it down
to "someone" that knew her well.

34:55.963 --> 34:58.008
Yeah, someone who knew
she was taking sleeping pills,

34:58.052 --> 34:59.401
knew her routine.

34:59.445 --> 35:00.794
And since Laney didn't do it,

35:00.837 --> 35:02.361
we can rule out
Dr. Pershing, too.

35:02.404 --> 35:05.015
Well, enough ruling out.
Anybody we can rule in?

35:05.059 --> 35:06.278
I got someone.

35:06.321 --> 35:08.671
Our victim had
a girlfriend.

35:08.715 --> 35:10.282
So?A married girlfriend.

35:10.325 --> 35:12.284
Ooh.Jealous husband, anyone?

35:12.327 --> 35:13.807
I like it already.

35:13.850 --> 35:15.722
Well, I finally got
administrator access

35:15.765 --> 35:18.681
to Cortez's bird channel,
and I found hundreds

35:18.725 --> 35:20.857
of private messages
from this woman

35:20.901 --> 35:23.860
and they are steamy.She got a name?

35:23.904 --> 35:25.688
BISHOP:
Just a screen name, for now.

35:25.732 --> 35:27.560
"HiHoBirdie."

35:27.603 --> 35:29.518
So, according to these messages,

35:29.562 --> 35:31.346
she and Cortez would meet up
at his place.

35:31.390 --> 35:32.739
Nothing, like, unusual,

35:32.782 --> 35:36.699
but take a look at this message
from last week.

35:38.223 --> 35:39.441
McGEE:
"Gotta be discreet,

35:39.485 --> 35:40.660
he almost caught us tonight."

35:40.703 --> 35:42.052
Yeah, so "he" is the husband.

35:42.096 --> 35:44.577
Presumably the jealous husband.

35:44.620 --> 35:47.319
What does "gnsdily" mean?

35:47.362 --> 35:50.148
TORRES/BISHOP:
Good night, sweet dreams,
I love you.

35:51.627 --> 35:53.847
Um...
It's, um...

35:53.890 --> 35:55.892
Everyone knows that.

35:55.936 --> 35:57.242
It's a common
texting shorthand.

35:57.285 --> 35:58.982
Very common, yeah.
Mm-hmm.

35:59.026 --> 36:00.680
Um, anyway,

36:00.723 --> 36:03.161
check out this message
a day later.

36:03.204 --> 36:04.510
TORRES:
"If he knew about us,

36:04.553 --> 36:05.902
he'd kill you."

36:05.946 --> 36:07.643
Yeah, that sounds
like a suspect.

36:07.687 --> 36:08.862
And this time with motive.

36:08.905 --> 36:10.255
What is the last
message she sent?

36:11.778 --> 36:14.346
GIBBS: What-what is that?
Is that even English?

36:14.389 --> 36:15.651
Uh, "Where are you?
Text me back."

36:15.695 --> 36:17.000
That was three hours ago.

36:17.044 --> 36:18.001
She doesn't know he's dead.

36:18.045 --> 36:19.046
Well, so let's text her back.

36:19.089 --> 36:20.700
Uh...
No, whoa, whoa,
boss, no.

36:20.743 --> 36:22.832
No. Maybe-maybe
we-we should do it.

36:22.876 --> 36:25.748
Yeah. Uh, you sort of
have to know the lingo.

36:25.792 --> 36:27.881
Well, then somebody lingo.

36:27.924 --> 36:29.187
Okay.

36:29.230 --> 36:31.798
Um, "Need 2CU.

36:31.841 --> 36:33.800
Come over."
What do you think?

36:33.843 --> 36:35.018
No, it needs this.

36:36.977 --> 36:39.197
Oh, you are
a real Casanova.

36:39.240 --> 36:41.242
Yeah. Every Thursdays,
I teach a class.

36:41.286 --> 36:44.376
BISHOP:
Oh, she already texted back.

36:44.419 --> 36:46.639
"Okay, be right there."GIBBS:
McGee, Torres.

36:46.682 --> 36:48.902
Get there first.

36:48.945 --> 36:49.990
[car door closes]

36:50.033 --> 36:51.034
WOMAN:
Joey!

36:51.078 --> 36:53.254
Joey, baby!

36:54.299 --> 36:55.648
I don't have a lot of time.

36:55.691 --> 36:58.912
Okay? Roger's gonna
be back pretty soon.

36:58.955 --> 37:00.218
HiHo, Birdie.

37:00.261 --> 37:02.829
Who, uh, who are you?

37:02.872 --> 37:05.048
Funny, I was just about
to ask you the same question.

37:05.092 --> 37:08.008
I am NCIS Special Agent
Timothy McGee.

37:08.051 --> 37:10.576
I'm sorry, I... I must
have the wrong house.

37:10.619 --> 37:12.360
Special Agent Nick Torres.

37:13.535 --> 37:15.102
Well, you've seen our I.D.s.

37:15.145 --> 37:16.843
So let's see yours.

37:16.886 --> 37:19.541
Um... [scoffs]

37:19.585 --> 37:21.717
What-What's going on?

37:21.761 --> 37:23.415
Well, Mrs. Ponziak,

37:23.458 --> 37:24.764
does your husband know
where you are?

37:24.807 --> 37:27.767
We know about you
and Joe Cortez.

37:27.810 --> 37:29.725
Yeah, so?

37:29.769 --> 37:30.987
I'm having an affair.

37:31.031 --> 37:32.859
Okay? It's not a crime.

37:32.902 --> 37:34.991
Actually, in the state
of Virginia, it is.

37:35.035 --> 37:36.384
And so is murder.

37:36.428 --> 37:37.603
Murder?

37:39.257 --> 37:40.562
Where's Joe?

37:40.606 --> 37:42.782
He's dead.

37:42.825 --> 37:45.175
Shot dead, actually.

37:48.178 --> 37:50.006
[exhales]

37:50.050 --> 37:51.443
He did it.

37:51.486 --> 37:53.009
He really did it.

37:53.053 --> 37:55.534
Your husband?

37:55.577 --> 37:57.231
He threatened to,

37:57.275 --> 38:00.452
but I didn't
take him seriously.

38:00.495 --> 38:03.237
Where's Mr. Ponziak now?

38:03.281 --> 38:06.719
At his OCD therapy session.

38:08.286 --> 38:10.679
With Dr. Pershing?

38:14.204 --> 38:16.337
PERSHING:
Yes, take a deep,
cleansing breath.

38:16.381 --> 38:17.947
NCIS!

38:17.991 --> 38:19.949
Oh, please, not again.Mr. Ponziak,

38:19.993 --> 38:20.820
hands where we can see 'em.

38:20.863 --> 38:22.474
He hypnotized?
Yeah.

38:22.517 --> 38:23.953
It's what I do.

38:23.997 --> 38:25.433
Wake him up.And, apparently,

38:25.477 --> 38:27.305
what you do is arrest
all my patients.

38:27.348 --> 38:29.132
Wake him up! Now.

38:29.176 --> 38:31.265
Okay.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.659
On the count of three,
Roger, we're going to...

38:33.702 --> 38:35.530
W-W-Wait. Actually,
before you bring him out of it,

38:35.574 --> 38:37.793
can you ask him
a few questions?

38:40.056 --> 38:41.275
Wait, you left him hypnotized?

38:41.319 --> 38:42.755
No, of course not.

38:42.798 --> 38:43.930
Gibbs wouldn't let me.

38:43.973 --> 38:46.149
Maybe you should have.

38:46.193 --> 38:47.890
He's not talking.

38:47.934 --> 38:50.893
McGEE: You found out
about your wife's affair.

38:50.937 --> 38:53.722
You went to Cortez's house
and confronted him.

38:53.766 --> 38:55.724
Then you shot him
with his own gun.

38:55.768 --> 38:59.380
Or maybe you just wanted
to talk, but he pulled a gun.

38:59.424 --> 39:01.991
There was a struggle,
and it went off.

39:02.035 --> 39:05.299
Roger, you could have
a case for self-defense here.

39:05.343 --> 39:07.083
[sighs]

39:07.127 --> 39:08.694
Roger.

39:13.960 --> 39:16.223
Oh! Sorry.

39:16.266 --> 39:19.269
What a mess.

39:19.313 --> 39:22.838
Look what I did.

39:22.882 --> 39:24.318
Sorry.

39:24.362 --> 39:25.841
You know who else is dirty?

39:25.885 --> 39:28.409
Joe Cortez.

39:28.453 --> 39:29.323
Oh, yeah.

39:29.367 --> 39:31.194
His house
was a disaster.

39:31.238 --> 39:33.806
Peanuts and seeds
all over the floor.

39:33.849 --> 39:37.113
Your wife probably tracked it
into your house.

39:37.157 --> 39:38.941
All ground up into your carpet.

39:38.985 --> 39:40.639
Look at this.It was disgusting!

39:40.682 --> 39:44.077
It was like an infestation
of-of husks and shells.

39:44.120 --> 39:45.165
So you took care of it.

39:45.208 --> 39:46.949
No more Cortez,
no more dirty house.

39:46.993 --> 39:48.995
Exactly.
Y-You understand me.I do.

39:49.038 --> 39:51.214
I completely understand that
you couldn't take the blame.

39:51.258 --> 39:53.695
And you had
an exceptional patsy

39:53.739 --> 39:55.741
in Corporal Laney Alimonte.

39:55.784 --> 39:58.047
The two of you had back-to-back
therapy sessions.

39:58.091 --> 40:00.223
You overheard everything through
those thin walls. How did you

40:00.267 --> 40:01.442
know she was gonna
be hypnotized that night?

40:01.486 --> 40:02.922
How'd you get her house keys?

40:02.965 --> 40:04.663
I mean, how'd you get
her fingerprints?

40:04.706 --> 40:08.101
She left her purse
in the waiting room.

40:08.144 --> 40:09.842
[chuckles]
Who does that?

40:09.885 --> 40:11.539
[laughs]

40:11.583 --> 40:13.280
And-and then I,
I took the...

40:13.323 --> 40:14.847
[laughs]
Write it down.

40:14.890 --> 40:17.284
Write it down.

40:21.114 --> 40:22.550
Great.

40:24.204 --> 40:26.162
Gotta give it to Gibbs.

40:26.206 --> 40:28.034
He makes 'em confess
and write it down.

40:28.077 --> 40:31.080
Hey, speaking of writing, you
wrote some very touching things

40:31.124 --> 40:32.691
in your little note
to me yesterday.

40:32.734 --> 40:34.519
What? I didn't
write you a note.

40:34.562 --> 40:36.477
Oh, really?
Because...

40:36.521 --> 40:40.481
this... sure looks
like your handwriting.

40:40.525 --> 40:43.223
What the hell?

40:43.745 --> 40:45.747
Oh, I'm never
getting hypnotized again.

40:45.791 --> 40:47.532
Hmm.What did I write?

40:47.575 --> 40:49.664
Personal stuff.

40:49.708 --> 40:51.971
It was actually
very touching.

40:52.014 --> 40:53.102
Seriously, give it back.

40:53.146 --> 40:55.061
Seriously, no.

40:55.104 --> 40:56.366
Okay, fine. Keep it.

40:56.410 --> 40:57.542
Read it every day.

40:57.585 --> 40:58.978
Think about me.

41:00.501 --> 41:02.764
Tell me what it says.Mm-mm.

41:02.808 --> 41:03.635
Hey.

41:03.678 --> 41:05.071
Hey.
Hey.

41:05.114 --> 41:06.942
I just finished Laney's
release paperwork.

41:06.986 --> 41:09.379
But, before she goes,
she wanted to say thank you.

41:09.423 --> 41:11.425
For accusing you of murder?

41:11.469 --> 41:14.428
No. Uh, because
of you guys,

41:14.472 --> 41:16.561
the Corps is reviewing
my discharge.

41:16.604 --> 41:18.214
Looks like they're
gonna upgrade it

41:18.258 --> 41:19.781
from OTH to general.

41:19.825 --> 41:22.392
Well, that's great.SECNAV recently issued

41:22.436 --> 41:25.439
a directive for Marines
with mental health issues,

41:25.483 --> 41:28.573
so that the system
will give them a fair shake.

41:28.616 --> 41:30.400
A general discharge means
I get VA health benefits,

41:30.444 --> 41:31.967
no questions asked.

41:32.011 --> 41:33.621
And can see a medical doctor

41:33.665 --> 41:35.884
to get the help
that you deserve.

41:35.928 --> 41:37.538
She wants to tell Gibbs.
Where is he?

41:37.582 --> 41:38.800
Oh, he just left.

41:38.844 --> 41:41.499
Uh, he raced out of
interrogation.

41:41.542 --> 41:43.892
GIBBS:
That's for you.

41:43.936 --> 41:47.113
Okay, now this one
should fit you better.

41:47.156 --> 41:49.637
Glove goes on your left,

41:49.681 --> 41:51.813
so you can throw
with your right.

41:53.032 --> 41:54.337
This is awesome.

41:54.381 --> 41:56.514
Yeah. Let's see
how it works.

42:00.518 --> 42:01.997
Oops. Squeeze it.

42:02.041 --> 42:03.433
All right, hit me in the chest.

42:03.477 --> 42:05.435
Aim for my chest. Right
here. Aim for my chest.

42:05.479 --> 42:07.220
Whoa!

42:07.263 --> 42:09.570
Sorry, Jethro Gibbs.Phineas.

42:09.614 --> 42:11.529
Okay. Yeah, whoa.

42:11.572 --> 42:13.226
We got a little work to do.

42:14.793 --> 42:17.012
Right here.

42:17.056 --> 42:18.579
That's it.

42:18.623 --> 42:19.928
Step, throw.

42:19.972 --> 42:22.104
Follow through.

42:22.148 --> 42:24.629
Ah, no. You're good.
You're good.

42:24.672 --> 42:26.761
All right.

42:26.805 --> 42:28.720
Yeah, man.

42:28.763 --> 42:31.157
You're a natural.

42:31.200 --> 42:32.811
Good.

42:32.854 --> 42:34.595
Step with your leg.
