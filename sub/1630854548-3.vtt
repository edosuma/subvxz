01:16.614 --> 01:18.117
[Dr. Winslow] I'm telling you,
Chief Kincaid,

01:18.210 --> 01:20.452
the Port Charlotte Ripper
is back.

01:20.551 --> 01:22.154
[Kincaid] That's impossible,
Dr. Winslow.

01:22.252 --> 01:24.756
The Port Charlotte Ripper
was executed last summer.

01:26.189 --> 01:29.194
-Unless...
-You arrested
the wrong man.

01:29.293 --> 01:30.662
Damn it!

01:30.762 --> 01:31.964
How dare they?

01:32.062 --> 01:33.698
[Kincaid] How could
I have missed this?

01:33.797 --> 01:35.834
They chose a total stranger
over me to lead them.

01:36.596 --> 01:38.437
Over me!

01:38.535 --> 01:41.006
Well. Their fucking loss.

01:41.105 --> 01:41.941
Mmm.

01:42.039 --> 01:44.104
Let them choke on it.

01:44.207 --> 01:46.811
...and I don't care that
you ran off and married
that Japanese sex robot.

01:46.911 --> 01:49.314
I've never stopped loving you.

01:49.413 --> 01:50.582
Kincaid, please...

01:50.681 --> 01:52.784
Ugh! You call
that a performance?

01:52.883 --> 01:54.353
[scoffs]

01:54.451 --> 01:57.990
Your love is about
to put himself in grave danger.

01:58.088 --> 02:01.121
-We mustn't...
-[Rita] There is no life
behind those eyes.

02:01.225 --> 02:02.394
[doorbell rings]

02:03.260 --> 02:04.296
Door.

02:06.097 --> 02:07.127
[doorbell ringing]

02:07.932 --> 02:09.468
Door.

02:09.566 --> 02:10.435
[Dr. Winslow] There's something
you should know.

02:10.534 --> 02:12.371
My name isn't Talia.

02:12.470 --> 02:14.106
-Shit.
-I'm not a doctor.

02:14.205 --> 02:15.707
I'm the Russian Grand Duchess.

02:16.774 --> 02:18.138
[wind blowing]

02:18.671 --> 02:19.544
Hello.

02:22.213 --> 02:24.349
Hello?

02:24.448 --> 02:26.785
I really don't need
any shenanigans today.

02:28.819 --> 02:30.655
[soft music playing]

02:33.757 --> 02:38.597
"Rita Farr retrospective.
At the Cloverton Art House."

02:40.397 --> 02:41.901
[speaking French]

02:41.999 --> 02:45.837
[laughing]

02:47.404 --> 02:49.774
At least,
someone appreciates me!

02:49.874 --> 02:51.171
[door slams]

02:51.275 --> 02:52.677
Find a new purpose.

02:54.746 --> 02:55.580
How?

02:57.381 --> 02:58.417
What does that even mean?

03:00.350 --> 03:01.420
[sighs]

03:02.654 --> 03:03.488
[grunts]

03:11.462 --> 03:12.531
[record scratches]

03:12.630 --> 03:14.533
[Spanish song playing]

03:27.945 --> 03:29.248
[sighs]

03:33.050 --> 03:33.885
Shit!

03:37.121 --> 03:38.290
[music stops]

03:41.058 --> 03:41.893
[sighs]

03:46.530 --> 03:48.567
Are you fucking kidding me?

03:49.901 --> 03:51.536
Fucking hate puzzles.

04:02.079 --> 04:02.982
Shelly?

04:04.381 --> 04:07.652
[wind howling]

04:11.055 --> 04:11.890
[gasps]

04:13.090 --> 04:14.326
[breathes heavily]

04:15.259 --> 04:16.295
[gasps]

04:16.393 --> 04:18.998
[breathing heavily]

04:20.264 --> 04:21.533
[gasps]

04:24.268 --> 04:27.739
[breathing heavily]

04:31.804 --> 04:33.112
Whoa.

04:33.210 --> 04:35.714
[breathing heavily]

04:49.221 --> 04:51.291
-[Calvin] Whoa.
-Whoa.

04:51.395 --> 04:52.932
[Derek] What's up, bro!

04:53.031 --> 04:54.599
Wow, Vic.

04:54.698 --> 04:57.436
-So, where's the tech?
-I'm back in the flesh.

04:58.869 --> 04:59.704
What's up, C?

05:07.045 --> 05:09.048
Cyborg was a badass, man.

05:09.147 --> 05:10.449
What gives?

05:10.547 --> 05:13.452
I made a change.
Works better for me.

05:13.550 --> 05:16.221
I'm still the same,
just without the tech.

05:16.315 --> 05:18.157
I'm more comfortable
in this skin.

05:18.255 --> 05:19.491
That's quite a change.

05:21.859 --> 05:24.429
Come on. I'm still
the same old Vic you guys know.

05:25.496 --> 05:27.532
Uh, is that synthetic skin?

05:27.631 --> 05:29.902
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah, I read about that.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.636
Wait, do you still
have your powers?

05:32.236 --> 05:33.705
Uh...

05:33.804 --> 05:37.476
Not really.
It's sort of complicated.

05:37.575 --> 05:40.079
Stealth,
but keeps 'em guessing.

05:40.177 --> 05:41.846
[chuckles] Hey.

05:41.945 --> 05:43.482
I mean, I wish
I could move through
the world like that, man.

05:43.580 --> 05:44.917
Well, we definitely don't
all have that luxury.

05:47.818 --> 05:49.288
[sighs]

05:49.386 --> 05:51.890
Yo, remember these guys?

05:51.990 --> 05:52.925
[all laugh]

05:53.023 --> 05:55.294
I remember Marcus'
high-water pants.

05:55.393 --> 05:57.062
Okay, those pants won us
the championship.

05:57.161 --> 05:59.598
-Aye, the Detroiticons.
-Couldn't touch us.

05:59.697 --> 06:02.968
-Forever undefeated.
-Oh. Hey, remember this?

06:04.702 --> 06:06.838
[in sing-song voice]
Da-da-da-na.

06:08.272 --> 06:09.708
What!

06:09.807 --> 06:11.776
[Derek] Our pride and joy.

06:11.876 --> 06:13.345
Worked our asses off on this.

06:13.443 --> 06:16.015
Hmm. Mister Indestructible.

06:16.113 --> 06:18.883
Clown, why are you still trying
to change his name?

06:18.982 --> 06:21.886
-You were out-voted.
-[all] Consensus ruled.

06:21.985 --> 06:24.589
-Man, Mister Invincible.
-Everything we wanted to be.

06:24.689 --> 06:26.491
-Bulletproof.
-Yes.

06:26.590 --> 06:28.593
You know, I remember
how hard it was for me
to connect those arms.

06:28.692 --> 06:31.030
I mean, the material
to make him bulletproof
was so hard to weld.

06:31.127 --> 06:34.366
I designed that head by drawing
on sister's big forehead.

06:34.466 --> 06:35.901
[all laughing]

06:35.999 --> 06:37.970
Yo, the robotics club was
in awe of Mister Invincible.

06:38.069 --> 06:39.704
Nah, man,
they were in awe of us.

06:39.803 --> 06:42.041
Yo, Derek and I stayed up
until 3:00 a.m.

06:42.139 --> 06:45.077
inscribing the
Detroiticons insignia.

06:45.176 --> 06:47.779
-Yo, it's still there, man.
-What?

06:47.879 --> 06:50.782
Yo. Best thing I ever did.

06:50.880 --> 06:53.752
It's the first time I ever
accomplished something.

06:53.851 --> 06:56.922
Gave me this fever to
just keep accomplishing shit.

06:57.021 --> 06:58.890
Hmm...

06:58.989 --> 07:02.422
I just got to say one time,
like, it feels so good to be
with you fellows again.

07:06.330 --> 07:07.199
-Come on.
-Ah!

07:08.365 --> 07:11.836
[all] Booyah!

07:11.931 --> 07:13.738
[all exclaiming]

07:14.471 --> 07:16.775
[all laughing]

07:19.911 --> 07:22.081
[electricity crackling]

07:22.174 --> 07:23.848
No more taunting me, Keeg!

07:24.849 --> 07:26.618
In fact, you know what?

07:26.718 --> 07:28.153
No more games.

07:28.252 --> 07:29.188
I'm ignoring you.

07:29.286 --> 07:30.322
You hear that?

07:30.422 --> 07:31.451
I am.

07:33.057 --> 07:33.892
Oh, God.

07:34.559 --> 07:36.861
[groans]

07:36.960 --> 07:40.065
Oh! I bet you think
I'm off my rocker.

07:40.164 --> 07:41.934
Yeah, well...

07:42.032 --> 07:43.002
[groans]

07:43.101 --> 07:45.004
You know, maybe,
maybe you were right.

07:45.101 --> 07:47.006
I should have
burned the little brat
when I had the chance.

07:47.805 --> 07:49.608
Oh, did I say that?

07:49.706 --> 07:53.645
[sighs] I'm sorry. I didn't...
I'm at my wits' end
with this kid.

07:53.745 --> 07:55.614
Okay? He's hiding in the walls.

07:55.713 --> 07:58.050
Okay, Larry, if I may...

07:58.147 --> 08:01.686
You might want to consider
that Keeg is just gone.

08:01.785 --> 08:03.288
I mean, he did leave you
in the future,

08:03.387 --> 08:07.927
so, you know, chances are
he's gone for good.

08:08.425 --> 08:09.594
[sighs]

08:09.693 --> 08:11.730
Is that the summation
of my life?

08:11.829 --> 08:13.598
Am I just meant to be alone?

08:13.698 --> 08:15.968
No. Try and find new meaning.

08:16.066 --> 08:20.500
New purpose. I mean,
do you have any powers
without Keeg?

08:20.605 --> 08:21.640
Yes.

08:22.574 --> 08:24.109
No.

08:24.208 --> 08:25.377
It's complicated.

08:25.476 --> 08:27.579
Ah, okay, well, let's look
on the bright side.

08:27.678 --> 08:30.249
You can enjoy
the peace and quiet.

08:30.347 --> 08:31.416
That's what I'm doing.

08:31.515 --> 08:33.585
You know, I looked at my past,

08:33.684 --> 08:35.420
and I decided
to leave it behind.

08:35.519 --> 08:39.024
Start afresh.
Quiet the demons of the past,
sort of saying.

08:39.123 --> 08:40.892
You should...
you should try it.

08:40.991 --> 08:44.263
Oh. Okay, I see.
Now that you've been voted
team leader,

08:44.361 --> 08:46.899
you're going to have
emotional wellness check-ins.

08:46.998 --> 08:49.301
Well, I'm not going to
feast on regret,

08:49.400 --> 08:53.505
but what I can do now
is become a better leader.

08:53.604 --> 08:55.535
-Like, if I may...
-You may.

08:55.639 --> 08:57.609
Before you go
giving out advice,

08:57.708 --> 09:00.913
maybe you should
make amends with the person
you hurt the most.

09:13.857 --> 09:16.761
It appears my fans
are running late. [chuckles]

09:22.032 --> 09:24.269
[orchestral music playing]

09:24.368 --> 09:25.971
Ooh, Secret Rendezvous.

09:26.070 --> 09:28.073
-[narrator] Secret Rendezvous.
-[sighs]

09:28.172 --> 09:30.442
[narrator] Starring
Kyla Wright,

09:30.541 --> 09:36.115
-Charles Auego
and introducing Rita Farr.
-[chuckles]

09:36.208 --> 09:37.416
It was my big break.

09:37.515 --> 09:39.851
[narrator] In this stately
Boston mansion,

09:39.949 --> 09:43.055
the wedding of the year
is about to commence.

09:43.788 --> 09:45.624
I smell cotton candy.

09:51.295 --> 09:52.731
[static noise]

09:57.702 --> 09:59.304
Man...

09:59.403 --> 10:01.740
Graham, the manager is still
giving us the hook up.

10:01.839 --> 10:03.542
Yeah, we're loyal customers.

10:03.640 --> 10:06.711
I mean, the three of us
been coming here
every week, for years.

10:06.811 --> 10:08.280
[Marcus] Yeah, five for four.

10:08.379 --> 10:10.149
I mean, I could down
one pie easily.

10:10.248 --> 10:12.612
Tell my mother I had
all my vegetables for the week.

10:12.717 --> 10:14.153
[laughing]

10:16.054 --> 10:16.888
Oh, Vic.

10:17.588 --> 10:19.158
My apologies, man.

10:19.256 --> 10:21.026
-I didn't.
-Oh, no, it's cool
to talk about my mom.

10:22.226 --> 10:23.895
Her funeral
was a super tough day.

10:23.994 --> 10:26.626
And thank you guys
for being pallbearers.

10:26.731 --> 10:28.067
You knew?

10:28.165 --> 10:29.969
Yeah. I mean, of course.
I was still recovering,

10:30.067 --> 10:32.104
but my dad told me...

10:34.171 --> 10:35.740
Too bad
you couldn't say goodbye.

10:36.807 --> 10:37.709
She was the best.

10:37.809 --> 10:39.044
Yeah.

10:39.138 --> 10:40.045
That's fine.

10:40.144 --> 10:41.680
I got to see her
in the afterlife.

10:42.880 --> 10:45.117
Afterlife? You mean,
like, your dreams?

10:45.216 --> 10:47.852
No, I mean, like,
where you go after you die.

10:48.787 --> 10:50.289
[chuckles]

10:50.387 --> 10:52.624
Look. See,
me and the Doom Patrol,
we all died.

10:52.724 --> 10:54.559
Well, half died.

10:54.658 --> 10:57.362
Then a couple of ghosts
saved us, and we survived.

10:59.196 --> 11:00.966
It's not the easiest thing
for me to explain.

11:01.065 --> 11:02.501
He's a superhero, dude.

11:02.599 --> 11:04.736
Like, they crush time
and all kinds of boundaries.

11:04.835 --> 11:07.272
No, no, no. Was a superhero.

11:07.366 --> 11:08.974
-[chuckles]
-[sighs]

11:10.440 --> 11:11.343
Was she happy?

11:13.477 --> 11:15.514
She was living her best life.

11:15.613 --> 11:17.983
Okay, then what's it like
up there?

11:18.550 --> 11:20.152
Pretty cool.

11:20.250 --> 11:21.886
You get to focus
on all the things
that you didn't get to do.

11:21.985 --> 11:23.822
So, Calvin, you'll finally get
a chance to open up

11:23.920 --> 11:25.824
that barber shop you keep
going on about.

11:25.923 --> 11:27.526
You just got to die first, huh?

11:27.625 --> 11:28.688
[all laughing]

11:28.793 --> 11:30.195
Funny. Funny.

11:30.294 --> 11:31.630
[Marcus] Look, you've always
had crazy strength, Vic.

11:31.730 --> 11:34.366
But Cyborg, that's next level.

11:34.465 --> 11:37.302
-What do you do
with all that power?
-Well, we stop bad guys.

11:37.401 --> 11:39.699
There was this one kid,
I gave him a second chance.

11:39.803 --> 11:43.075
I gave him the opportunity
to make different choices
with his life.

11:45.810 --> 11:46.845
Okay.

11:50.348 --> 11:52.317
We stopped
the testicle monster.

11:52.415 --> 11:54.920
[chuckles] It was crazy.
This thing was screwing up
shipping lanes.

11:55.018 --> 11:57.856
People couldn't get things
like wood that they needed
for their homes.

11:57.954 --> 12:01.360
Right! For that new house
I'm building on the lake,
right? [laughs]

12:01.459 --> 12:03.228
That new house you'll be
building in heaven.

12:03.327 --> 12:04.896
[both laughing]

12:04.996 --> 12:06.331
Vic this, Vic that,

12:06.430 --> 12:08.267
I mean, all we've been
talking about is Vic.

12:08.365 --> 12:11.336
But Vic, you haven't even asked
about your best friend, Derek.

12:11.435 --> 12:13.172
I mean, he did
what we promised to do.

12:13.270 --> 12:16.508
Change the world
starting locally, in Detroit.

12:18.175 --> 12:19.739
[Vic] Yeah, man,
that's awesome.

12:19.843 --> 12:22.014
[clears throat]
Yo, D, tell me about it.

12:23.081 --> 12:25.745
I started a robotics club
in Detroit.

12:25.849 --> 12:27.119
I teach kids
how to build robots.

12:27.217 --> 12:29.054
Nah, he's being modest, man.

12:29.153 --> 12:30.355
These kids love it.

12:30.454 --> 12:31.991
The stuff they build
is next level.

12:32.089 --> 12:34.559
Mmm-hmm. I wanna
be a part of that.

12:34.658 --> 12:38.063
Bring back the old
robotics dream team. [chuckles]

12:38.162 --> 12:39.298
How do I volunteer?

12:41.031 --> 12:44.003
These guys volunteer,
you know, they help me out.

12:44.101 --> 12:45.237
I can count on them.

12:45.903 --> 12:48.507
So, I'm good.

12:48.605 --> 12:49.942
[feedback over microphone]

12:50.039 --> 12:52.677
[announcer] The laser tag
championship is underway.

12:52.777 --> 12:54.279
The reigning champs,

12:54.378 --> 12:57.777
Your Worst Nightmare,
defeated the last opponent.

12:57.881 --> 13:00.852
Making them undefeated,
and unstoppable.

13:00.950 --> 13:04.456
Any others in here
brave enough to take on
the champs?

13:06.055 --> 13:07.787
They look how we looked
back in the day.

13:07.892 --> 13:08.994
[Derek and Marcus chuckle]

13:09.093 --> 13:10.729
Yo, let's take our title back.

13:10.827 --> 13:13.498
Oh, we haven't played
since you left, Vic.
We're rusty.

13:13.597 --> 13:16.068
Hey, loosen up
your turtleneck, man.
Let's have some fun.

13:16.167 --> 13:17.236
Yo, it's laser tag.

13:17.334 --> 13:18.637
Come on, man. We own that game.

13:18.737 --> 13:19.939
We got this.

13:22.072 --> 13:23.175
Let's get it!

13:23.274 --> 13:24.843
-[all cheering]
-There it is.

13:26.210 --> 13:28.147
[orchestral music playing]

13:28.245 --> 13:29.448
Mmm.

13:31.416 --> 13:32.384
Oh.

13:34.284 --> 13:35.120
Oh, no.

13:37.154 --> 13:39.391
Oh, no, no, no, no.

13:39.490 --> 13:42.094
Polly, what are
you going on about?

13:43.861 --> 13:45.497
-I know you.
-Yes, Yes.

13:45.595 --> 13:48.633
I am the evil mother forcing
her incorrigible daughter
to marry

13:48.732 --> 13:51.236
only the third wealthiest man
in America.

13:51.335 --> 13:54.139
Too late now. You're doomed
to be rich and famous.

13:54.238 --> 13:55.574
And why are you
just sitting there?

13:55.672 --> 13:57.576
Really, dear,
the wedding's tomorrow.

13:57.675 --> 13:58.911
There's so much to do.

13:59.009 --> 14:01.480
Good heavens,
I'm in Secret Rendezvous.

14:01.579 --> 14:03.282
[mother] And there
she goes again.

14:03.380 --> 14:05.250
Come on. No more
lollygagging, you.

14:05.349 --> 14:07.786
I've laid out
your beautiful dress upstairs.

14:07.885 --> 14:09.688
No. You don't understand.

14:09.787 --> 14:11.851
I'm not supposed to be here.

14:13.290 --> 14:15.995
Your pretty little head
is a tad confused.

14:16.093 --> 14:19.398
Darling, I am not supposed
to be here.

14:19.497 --> 14:21.934
It's bad luck to see you
before the wedding.

14:22.032 --> 14:23.202
But I couldn't stay away.

14:23.300 --> 14:26.205
Alistair Kincaid. [gasps]

14:26.303 --> 14:29.074
My God, you were good looking,
weren't you? [chuckles]

14:29.173 --> 14:30.775
Ah, but before you say
another word--

14:30.875 --> 14:32.211
-Uh-uh.
-[gasps]

14:33.912 --> 14:35.948
A jewel for my jewel.

14:37.281 --> 14:38.878
[chuckles] Alistair...

14:39.717 --> 14:41.553
Damn it. Alistair...

14:42.053 --> 14:43.488
Well...

14:43.588 --> 14:44.523
You shouldn't have.

14:45.457 --> 14:46.391
[giggles]

14:47.792 --> 14:49.861
Can you see it, darling?

14:49.961 --> 14:51.863
The biggest wedding
of the decade.

14:51.963 --> 14:53.198
Your face
on all the front pages

14:53.297 --> 14:55.767
of all the broadsheets
in all the world.

14:55.866 --> 14:57.602
Everyone knows your name.

14:57.702 --> 14:59.638
Everyone loves you.

14:59.736 --> 15:03.042
And that Princess of Monaco
will eat her hat.

15:03.140 --> 15:06.511
Alistair Kincaid,
you are a troublemaker.

15:06.611 --> 15:08.113
[sighs]

15:08.212 --> 15:09.949
No, I can see it.

15:10.748 --> 15:14.453
Or... I do see it.

15:14.553 --> 15:16.388
I mean, why not?

15:16.488 --> 15:17.918
Why not me?

15:18.022 --> 15:20.625
Do I not deserve to be loved?

15:20.720 --> 15:22.194
That's the spirit, my darling.

15:23.093 --> 15:24.163
[sighs]

15:25.930 --> 15:27.632
[eerie music playing]

15:35.606 --> 15:36.341
[sighs]

15:36.440 --> 15:37.576
[Cliff] What's up with you?

15:38.175 --> 15:39.912
Are you glowing?

15:40.011 --> 15:42.114
-No.
-[Cliff] Something's different.

15:42.212 --> 15:44.383
-New haircut?
-What? God!

15:44.483 --> 15:45.317
No, shut up.

15:47.385 --> 15:49.221
Okay, look, I'm going
to tell you something,

15:49.318 --> 15:51.323
but you can't make
a big deal about it
because it's not a big deal.

15:51.421 --> 15:53.292
-I'm listening.
-[sighs]

15:53.390 --> 15:56.061
Okay. Do you remember
when we were in Cloverton

15:56.160 --> 15:58.330
and Flex did that...

15:59.263 --> 16:02.201
thing and we all felt...

16:02.299 --> 16:04.703
If you're talking about
the orgasm thing,

16:04.803 --> 16:06.038
I don't want to talk about it.

16:06.505 --> 16:08.140
Why?

16:08.237 --> 16:11.210
Because, Jane,
maybe I don't want to talk
about orgasms, or feelings

16:11.308 --> 16:14.579
or touching little butts
that go pop in your hand.

16:15.346 --> 16:18.850
Okay. What's up with you?

16:18.950 --> 16:20.785
[Cliff grunts]

16:20.884 --> 16:22.955
[Larry] Okay, look,
let's just agree that
we're all going through

16:23.054 --> 16:24.656
a little something.

16:24.755 --> 16:27.026
Maybe what we need
is to sit here in peace
and quiet.

16:27.124 --> 16:28.693
[alarm blaring]

16:28.793 --> 16:29.761
Hmm.

16:29.861 --> 16:30.991
[Larry groans]

16:31.095 --> 16:33.732
Of course, why not?
Bring it on.

16:34.532 --> 16:36.335
Team meeting!

16:39.236 --> 16:41.440
Why? We beat the Butts.

16:41.538 --> 16:43.242
[Larry] Yeah,
we're good, De Mille.

16:43.335 --> 16:45.877
Whatever you're trying to do,
make it a solo mission.

16:45.971 --> 16:48.613
Except this is a new kind
of mission

16:48.712 --> 16:51.616
which focuses on team building,
togetherness.

16:51.715 --> 16:54.253
So, the mantra moving forward
will be...

16:58.155 --> 17:01.293
T-R-U-S-T. Trust.

17:01.391 --> 17:04.263
Oh, fuck me. I'm back
on Underground Avenue.

17:04.362 --> 17:07.299
You might not know this,
but we trust each other.

17:08.232 --> 17:09.401
Or did.

17:10.401 --> 17:12.004
-We just don't trust you.
-[scoffs]

17:12.103 --> 17:14.173
And besides, we chose you
to be a hard ass.

17:14.271 --> 17:15.774
What's with this softer,
wimpy shit?

17:15.872 --> 17:18.643
Correct. You chose me,
and I have devised a plan.

17:18.742 --> 17:22.982
So here it is, our first
trust building exercise

17:23.080 --> 17:27.920
will be to support Rita
at her movie retrospective.

17:28.013 --> 17:29.421
[Cliff] What movie
retrospective?

17:31.055 --> 17:33.025
"The Cloverton Art House."

17:33.123 --> 17:34.693
Cloverton is a town
full of dimwits.

17:34.791 --> 17:36.828
Do they even have an art house?
This seems fake.

17:36.928 --> 17:37.930
[Cliff] Nope, nope.

17:38.028 --> 17:40.399
The Clovertonians detest us.

17:40.498 --> 17:42.567
Especially Rita.
Doesn't add up.

17:42.666 --> 17:45.971
All the more reason for us
to show Rita our support.

17:46.070 --> 17:48.068
And why didn't she tell us?

17:48.171 --> 17:50.375
[Larry] Maybe because
she was hurt when we didn't
choose her as team leader.

17:50.474 --> 17:52.677
Trying to heal that, but I...

17:55.045 --> 17:55.981
[sighs]

17:56.080 --> 17:57.182
...need your help.

18:02.120 --> 18:03.555
[groans]

18:05.255 --> 18:06.525
[Cliff sighs]

18:14.598 --> 18:16.035
[Larry] Hey, yeah.
Sorry, folks,

18:16.134 --> 18:17.302
I won't be joining you.

18:17.401 --> 18:18.737
I don't have the strength.

18:18.835 --> 18:21.173
I'm still trying to wrangle
my wayward kid.

18:21.270 --> 18:24.910
[Cliff] Seriously, are you
gonna stay here and wait
for your fucked up,

18:25.009 --> 18:26.912
manipulative kid who abandoned

18:27.011 --> 18:28.647
your self-flagellating ass?

18:28.746 --> 18:31.283
Or are you going to support
your best friend, Rita?

18:31.381 --> 18:33.113
-Fuck, yeah! Rita!
-[Cliff] Rita!

18:33.216 --> 18:39.691
-[Jane] Rita.
-[all cheering] Rita,
Rita, Rita.

18:39.790 --> 18:42.361
-[cheering continues]
Rita, Rita.
-[Larry groans]

18:43.293 --> 18:44.964
[orchestral music playing]

18:45.062 --> 18:46.731
[sighs]

18:46.831 --> 18:48.433
[Rita humming]

18:48.532 --> 18:49.834
[Cliff] Where is she?

18:49.933 --> 18:51.670
[Larry] Shh.
This is Secret Rendezvous.

18:55.339 --> 18:56.841
[Rita as Polly] What's this?

18:56.940 --> 19:00.045
A twist? Just before
young Polly's wedding day.

19:00.144 --> 19:01.413
Okay, that's Oliver Truman.

19:01.511 --> 19:03.615
Polly's true secret love.

19:03.713 --> 19:09.588
[Rita as Polly] The dashing
Oliver Truman sneaking
into my window. But why?

19:09.687 --> 19:12.891
Could it be
he's my true secret love?

19:12.990 --> 19:14.693
-Here to rescue me...
-[Larry] Thank you.

19:14.791 --> 19:17.196
...from a lifetime
of endless wealth and ennui.

19:17.295 --> 19:20.065
Has he come to spirit me
away into the night?

19:20.164 --> 19:22.834
Why, um, yes.

19:23.567 --> 19:24.769
Something like that.

19:24.868 --> 19:26.271
-[Rita as Polly chuckles]
-[Larry] Huh?

19:26.370 --> 19:28.807
Something like what?

19:28.906 --> 19:31.944
What? Oh, yes, yes.

19:35.947 --> 19:37.716
Hey, what gives?

19:37.814 --> 19:40.485
We were having an affair
during this movie.

19:40.584 --> 19:43.923
You kissed me
with reckless abandon.

19:44.021 --> 19:48.160
Are you saving it
for our secret rendezvous
at the gazebo,

19:48.259 --> 19:51.296
where you finally
steal me away?

19:51.395 --> 19:53.899
Sure, the secret rendezvous
in the gazebo.

19:54.965 --> 19:55.968
Try it again.

19:56.066 --> 19:57.002
[clears throat]

19:57.101 --> 19:59.104
But this time, convince me.

19:59.202 --> 20:02.307
Oh, for the love of God,
just get through
the goddamn scene!

20:02.406 --> 20:03.675
Haven't seen
my family in years.

20:03.773 --> 20:05.477
My kids are growing up
without me.

20:05.576 --> 20:07.346
Why does this movie suck balls?

20:07.444 --> 20:08.981
-That's not the dialogue.
-[Rita] That's not
the dialogue.

20:09.080 --> 20:11.816
[Oliver] Please,
just do what she wants.

20:11.916 --> 20:12.784
I am begging you.

20:12.878 --> 20:13.986
We're all begging you.

20:14.986 --> 20:16.255
[choking]

20:16.353 --> 20:17.289
[Rita] Oliver?

20:17.389 --> 20:18.723
[retches]

20:18.822 --> 20:21.426
-[Cliff] What the fuck!
-[Rita] Oliver?

20:21.525 --> 20:23.828
[Oliver gagging and retching]

20:23.928 --> 20:24.796
[Rita sighs]

20:25.964 --> 20:27.632
Hold on.

20:27.731 --> 20:31.003
I think Rita
might be in this movie.

20:31.102 --> 20:32.232
[Cliff and Jane] No, shit!

20:32.336 --> 20:35.774
No, I mean, in the movie.

20:35.873 --> 20:37.776
What the hell
is going on here?

20:40.544 --> 20:44.083
[both] No shit.

20:44.181 --> 20:46.418
Hmm. I smell...

20:46.516 --> 20:48.353
coconut cream pie.

20:49.220 --> 20:51.356
[eerie music playing]

20:57.389 --> 20:59.398
[Cliff] Does anyone
smell Nutella?

21:03.467 --> 21:05.637
Oh, for fuck sake!

21:11.441 --> 21:12.477
[Rita as Polly] Hello?

21:15.246 --> 21:18.250
Hello... hello!

21:18.348 --> 21:20.752
Oh! This is not a gazebo.

21:23.054 --> 21:26.158
[Rita] Oh... fuck!

21:26.257 --> 21:28.460
This isn't Secret Rendezvous.

21:28.559 --> 21:31.330
This is
The Haunting of White Manor.

21:32.163 --> 21:32.998
[exhales]

21:34.731 --> 21:37.436
I don't know what the hell
is going on here,

21:37.534 --> 21:39.704
or who thinks this is funny.

21:39.803 --> 21:43.875
But this movie
gave me nightmares,
and I am not amused.

21:45.070 --> 21:46.511
[creepy kid giggles]

21:48.379 --> 21:49.481
[Rita] Fuck.

21:53.117 --> 21:55.820
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

22:00.290 --> 22:01.560
[Larry] Oh, my God.

22:02.292 --> 22:03.929
Am I in Rita's movie?

22:06.430 --> 22:07.799
I know this gazebo.

22:09.566 --> 22:12.071
I'm in Secret Rendezvous.

22:12.169 --> 22:15.040
You know, in happier times,
this would have been
a fantasy come true.

22:15.139 --> 22:16.041
But now...

22:18.776 --> 22:25.017
[softly] Rita? Rita? Rita?

22:27.351 --> 22:28.487
Who are you?

22:28.587 --> 22:29.989
I'm Oliver Truman.

22:30.087 --> 22:32.024
Polly's true love,
her newspaper man.

22:34.191 --> 22:37.462
-And you're not Polly.
-And you're not Oliver, pal.

22:38.595 --> 22:40.360
I'm Rita's best friend.

22:40.465 --> 22:41.733
At least I was.

22:41.832 --> 22:43.302
And I'm here to get her
out of this.

22:43.400 --> 22:44.603
So let's try this again.

22:44.702 --> 22:46.471
Who the hell are you?

22:46.570 --> 22:50.642
How does it feel
to walk around in the world
bandaged up like that?

22:50.741 --> 22:53.578
How do you think it feels?
Exactly how it looks.

22:53.677 --> 22:55.747
[man] Your life must
be devoid of sensuality.

22:55.846 --> 22:58.317
Yeah, well, everyone's life
is devoid of something.

22:58.414 --> 23:02.054
More importantly,
if I don't wear these bandages,
everyone will die.

23:03.354 --> 23:04.856
How do you have human contact?

23:06.458 --> 23:07.492
I don't.

23:08.593 --> 23:09.628
I used to.

23:12.029 --> 23:15.000
-I have memories.
-And memories
are enough to satisfy you?

23:15.099 --> 23:17.702
It's not like
I have a choice in this.

23:17.797 --> 23:18.870
Okay?

23:18.969 --> 23:20.572
Well, how do you know
that you don't?

23:21.772 --> 23:24.709
I'm the man in many elements.

23:24.808 --> 23:26.745
What if I were to tell you
you're right?

23:26.844 --> 23:28.580
I am not a newspaper man.

23:28.678 --> 23:31.016
I'm just an innocent soul
trapped in here, too.

23:31.683 --> 23:33.152
[Larry] By who?

23:33.250 --> 23:34.619
A strange creature, really.

23:34.719 --> 23:36.455
She calls herself Dr. Janus.

23:36.553 --> 23:39.624
Our order is to get your friend
to emote as much as possible.

23:39.724 --> 23:41.226
But what does that even mean?

23:41.325 --> 23:42.594
She's an actress.

23:42.693 --> 23:44.629
She wakes up emoting.
How do I save her?

23:44.729 --> 23:46.531
It's hard to say.

23:46.630 --> 23:48.767
Dr. Janus is sending
your friend through
her movie retrospective

23:48.867 --> 23:50.169
until she gets what she wants.

23:50.267 --> 23:53.238
She controls everything
about this place.

23:53.336 --> 23:56.475
Then again,
I know a thing or two
about this place as well.

23:56.574 --> 23:57.842
I've been trapped
here long enough.

24:00.944 --> 24:02.948
Maybe the two of us
can find a way.

24:04.915 --> 24:07.519
The two of us? Me and you?

24:11.216 --> 24:13.025
Sure, lead the way.

24:20.797 --> 24:23.602
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

24:23.701 --> 24:25.137
Fucking hell!

24:25.230 --> 24:27.072
[sighs] Fuck, fuck, fuck...

24:29.140 --> 24:30.309
Fuck.

24:30.408 --> 24:33.112
[exhales] Think, Rouge.
Think, think, think...

24:35.446 --> 24:36.748
Where's that fucking flier?

24:40.351 --> 24:41.853
"Rita Farr retrospective.

24:41.952 --> 24:44.123
A star from the golden age
of Hollywood."

24:44.222 --> 24:45.890
Hmm, questionable.

24:45.984 --> 24:49.594
"Playing at
the Cloverton Art House.
Dr. Janus Productions."

24:49.694 --> 24:51.596
Hmm, Dr. Janus.

24:52.263 --> 24:53.665
Dr. Janus?

24:56.568 --> 24:57.903
Dr. Janus.

24:59.670 --> 25:02.908
No, no, no, no...

25:05.109 --> 25:07.812
Well... Hello.

25:09.246 --> 25:10.782
"Name: Dr. Janus.

25:10.881 --> 25:14.786
Category: Emotional vampire."
Fuck.

25:14.885 --> 25:17.856
[sighs] "Weakness: Fragile ego,
lacks empathy."

25:17.955 --> 25:19.858
Oh, that's the same
for most of us.

25:19.956 --> 25:24.663
"Weapon: creates
artificial realities,
hallucinations."

25:25.296 --> 25:26.298
Oh, shit.

25:28.700 --> 25:29.834
"How to combat?"

25:34.271 --> 25:35.707
"How to combat?"

25:35.806 --> 25:37.176
Are you fucking kidding me?

25:37.274 --> 25:38.410
That's it?

25:38.503 --> 25:40.112
That's... that's all
you've got?

25:40.210 --> 25:45.484
Niles Caulder? You selfish,
sex-deprived, son of a prick.

25:45.583 --> 25:48.520
You have left out the most
important piece of information.

25:48.618 --> 25:50.222
How am I supposed
to defeat her now?

25:50.321 --> 25:54.193
You fucking asshole!

25:55.525 --> 25:56.661
[Cliff] Hello?

25:58.362 --> 25:59.198
Hello.

26:02.734 --> 26:04.069
Where the fuck are we?

26:09.440 --> 26:10.875
[softly] What the fuck!

26:10.975 --> 26:13.612
Are we in one of Rita's movies?

26:13.711 --> 26:15.180
I don't fucking know.

26:15.279 --> 26:16.648
Never saw one.

26:16.747 --> 26:18.883
Every time I try
to watch one of her movies,

26:18.982 --> 26:21.987
Top Gun comes on.
Saturday matinee.

26:22.086 --> 26:25.490
Yeah, same.
You can't not watch Top Gun.

26:25.590 --> 26:26.926
Hell yeah, Goose.

26:27.024 --> 26:29.228
-Hell yeah, Maverick.
-[hand clangs]

26:29.326 --> 26:31.663
[door creaking]

26:31.762 --> 26:34.166
Is this supposed
to be a horror movie?

26:34.265 --> 26:36.201
'Cause... not scary.

26:37.001 --> 26:38.837
[eerie music plays]

26:38.936 --> 26:41.706
[laughs] Still not scary.

26:41.806 --> 26:42.841
[floorboard creaking]

26:43.541 --> 26:44.409
[both] Fuck!

26:44.508 --> 26:46.145

26:50.014 --> 26:51.116
-[Cliff whimpering]
-Shh.

26:54.751 --> 26:56.821
-You go out.
-Fuck that. You go out.

26:56.921 --> 26:58.390
You're made
out of fucking metal.

26:58.490 --> 26:59.358
[Cliff groans]

27:01.826 --> 27:03.428
-We're badasses.
-Yeah.

27:03.527 --> 27:06.565
We fucking destroyed
the testicle monster.

27:06.664 --> 27:08.200
It's just a fucking kid.

27:08.293 --> 27:10.169
That's not just some kid.

27:10.262 --> 27:11.770
That's a creepy kid.

27:11.869 --> 27:14.634
Is anyone ever not scared
of a creepy kid?

27:14.739 --> 27:15.774
[Cliff] True.

27:19.575 --> 27:23.348
-[upbeat music playing]

Three, two, one.

-[buzzer blares]
-[automated voice] Game on.

27:25.617 --> 27:26.685
[Vic] Where you at?

27:26.784 --> 27:28.053
[laser guns firing]

27:31.388 --> 27:33.225
Here we go, here we go.

27:33.324 --> 27:34.159
Marcus, left!

27:35.627 --> 27:36.656
Duck.

27:42.432 --> 27:44.203
-[Vic] Booyah!
-He's down, he's down.

27:44.302 --> 27:45.137
Yes.

27:46.771 --> 27:48.668
[both exclaiming]

27:57.915 --> 27:59.884
Go. I got your back.

27:59.983 --> 28:02.021
Yeah, that's what
you always said, but you left.

28:03.420 --> 28:04.756
Wait, what?

28:04.856 --> 28:05.790
I didn't leave, I was grieving.

28:05.890 --> 28:07.792
Yeah, we were grieving too.

28:07.892 --> 28:09.294
But you weren't with us.

28:09.393 --> 28:11.530
The more we reached out,
the more you backed away.

28:11.628 --> 28:14.399
Why do you think
I'm back here now
in my skin again?

28:14.498 --> 28:15.434
That's a good question.

28:15.534 --> 28:16.535
You tell me.

28:16.634 --> 28:18.037
Why are you back?

28:18.135 --> 28:20.739
Yo, I had to mourn my mom
and figure out who I was.

28:20.838 --> 28:24.977
And now I'm reconnecting
with who I was before
the accident.

28:25.075 --> 28:26.946
Connecting with people
that were most important to me.

28:28.512 --> 28:30.983
We tried to be there
for you back then.

28:31.081 --> 28:32.051
We couldn't find you.

28:32.149 --> 28:33.953
So you just stopped trying?

28:34.051 --> 28:36.488
Were we supposed
to just chase you down?

28:36.587 --> 28:39.491
We don't have superpowers, Vic.

28:39.589 --> 28:41.460
I was your best friend.
You didn't even try to find me.

28:41.558 --> 28:44.163
No. Let me remind you
that I found you guys now,

28:44.261 --> 28:45.898
and I'm trying to make up
for the time we lost.

28:45.997 --> 28:47.832
Except you can't.

28:47.932 --> 28:50.035
Too much time
has already passed.

28:50.134 --> 28:52.871
We're not the same people
we once were.

28:52.970 --> 28:55.707
We have been shaped
by life in Detroit.

28:55.807 --> 28:57.109
There's been a lot of beauty,

28:57.208 --> 28:58.911
but also a lot of shit
that we had to face.

29:00.111 --> 29:02.347
Made us the men
that we are today.

29:02.446 --> 29:05.684
-You missed all of that.
-Yo, I didn't ask to be Cyborg.

29:05.783 --> 29:08.420
But I did ask to be put back
in the body that's closest
to the body--

29:08.519 --> 29:10.355
Vic, are you hearing me?

29:10.454 --> 29:14.393
You were Mr. Invincible
for all the years
that we were vulnerable.

29:14.491 --> 29:17.757
Even now,
your skin is impenetrable.

29:18.329 --> 29:19.298
Mine is not.

29:20.999 --> 29:23.763
I lost my best friend.

29:23.867 --> 29:26.171
What you don't understand
is that we live
different lives.

29:26.270 --> 29:27.940
I lost my best friend, too.

29:29.974 --> 29:31.143
But I'm here now.

29:32.110 --> 29:33.578
Why can't that be enough?

29:33.678 --> 29:36.248
[laser gun firing]

29:36.341 --> 29:37.182
[girl giggling]

29:38.549 --> 29:40.953
[buzzer blares]

29:41.052 --> 29:43.022
[automated voice] Game over.

29:47.291 --> 29:50.529
[sighs] I'm sorry
for blowing you off earlier.

29:50.627 --> 29:53.132
We can totally talk
about orgasms if you want to.

29:54.733 --> 29:55.567
[groans]

29:59.269 --> 30:02.174
You remember the fog,
right? Shelly?

30:03.007 --> 30:04.843
Sisterhood of Dada.

30:04.942 --> 30:06.245
Yeah, I hate those fucks.

30:06.978 --> 30:08.380
Very nice.

30:08.479 --> 30:14.286
Yeah, well... I saw her eye...
in a puzzle piece.

30:14.384 --> 30:16.922
Then this mist
came out of the puzzle.

30:19.190 --> 30:21.393
-For real?
-I don't know. Felt real.

30:21.993 --> 30:22.995
Felt really real.

30:23.094 --> 30:26.765
Oh, shit. The mist seduced you?

30:26.865 --> 30:28.433
-Is that weird?
-Why?

30:28.532 --> 30:30.235
-Because you blew a boner?
-[groans]

30:30.334 --> 30:31.870
-You set one free?
-Uh--

30:31.968 --> 30:34.673
No, I tell ya,
of all the feelings
in the world,

30:34.772 --> 30:36.508
I miss that the most.

30:36.607 --> 30:38.043
Nothing in life compares.

30:38.142 --> 30:40.145
If there's a Hall of Fame
for feelings,

30:40.244 --> 30:41.981
that's numero uno.

30:42.078 --> 30:45.951
Top of the charts.
Undefeated. The be all
and end all of feelings.

30:46.049 --> 30:48.887
Cleanup, Phyllis,
because the fat lady has sung.

30:48.986 --> 30:50.755
Okay. A, you're disgusting.

30:50.855 --> 30:53.258
And B, it was...

30:54.725 --> 30:57.963
tender... gentle.

30:58.061 --> 31:02.667
In my entire life,
no one or nothing
has ever touched me like that.

31:02.766 --> 31:04.904
So what's the problem?
It sounds like you liked it.

31:04.996 --> 31:07.372
[Jane] It's not about
whether I liked it.

31:07.471 --> 31:09.174
I have to think
about what's best for Kay.

31:09.273 --> 31:11.276
Fuck it. Forget about Kay.

31:11.370 --> 31:12.477
How do you feel?

31:14.812 --> 31:16.015
[Jane sighs]

31:17.381 --> 31:19.451
I can't forget about Kay.
That's the point.

31:19.551 --> 31:20.785
[both scream]

31:20.885 --> 31:22.054
[Larry] Hey, guys.

31:22.153 --> 31:23.956
Meet my new friend, not Oliver.

31:24.055 --> 31:25.324
He can take us to Rita.

31:27.025 --> 31:28.460
[eerie music playing]

31:28.560 --> 31:29.929
Fuck!

31:30.027 --> 31:31.931
-Fuck, fuck, fuck.
-[door creaking]

31:32.897 --> 31:33.933
Fuck.

31:37.134 --> 31:39.571
-Did I frighten you, Mary Ann?
-[gasps]

31:39.670 --> 31:42.975
It's time for you
to read me a bedtime story.

31:44.141 --> 31:45.544
Look, you...

31:46.845 --> 31:48.909
I know this is all bullshit.

31:50.247 --> 31:52.151
I know you played
the creepy kid.

31:52.249 --> 31:55.687
But I also know
your real name is Orville.

31:55.786 --> 31:59.091
And you were still pooping
your pants during the making
of this movie,

31:59.190 --> 32:01.826
which, trust me,
creeped everybody out.

32:01.921 --> 32:04.596
Somehow, I got trapped
in my movies

32:04.695 --> 32:06.598
which made me feel good
for a while,

32:06.697 --> 32:09.334
but it doesn't anymore,
and I want out.

32:11.035 --> 32:13.472
[floorboard creaks]

32:13.571 --> 32:16.841
Just do what she says
or you're gonna make
things worse.

32:16.940 --> 32:22.014
Who is she?
Because trust me, kid,
things can't get much worse.

32:22.113 --> 32:24.249
Not for you, for your friends.

32:25.517 --> 32:26.618
Wait.

32:26.712 --> 32:28.120
What are you talking about?

32:31.989 --> 32:33.025
[thuds]

32:34.092 --> 32:35.956
Oh, well, damn it. [inhales]

32:36.060 --> 32:38.230
There is no way to save them.

32:40.230 --> 32:43.735
I've sent them to their deaths.

32:45.535 --> 32:47.606
And the mission
was trust. [scoffs]

32:48.873 --> 32:50.342
I can't even trust myself.

32:51.809 --> 32:53.012
I mean,

32:53.111 --> 32:57.749
why did anyone think
that I was worthy

32:57.849 --> 32:59.651
of being a leader?

32:59.750 --> 33:01.453
Navel-gazing bastards.

33:01.552 --> 33:04.823
Were any of you
paying attention?

33:04.921 --> 33:09.494
Have you not seen
my track record, people?
Fucking hell.

33:09.593 --> 33:11.096
All right,
let's count them off.

33:12.463 --> 33:14.466
All right?

33:14.565 --> 33:19.571
One, half-ass victory
against the Butts.

33:22.273 --> 33:25.544
Two, Cliff feeling
the pain of violence.

33:28.212 --> 33:32.012
Number three, fucked over Rita.

33:35.186 --> 33:36.655
Number four,

33:36.754 --> 33:43.023
I had Malcolm killed,
which again fucked over Rita.

33:43.127 --> 33:45.064
Right? Mmm.

33:46.564 --> 33:47.432
Number five...

33:49.901 --> 33:52.671
I stamped innocent people...

33:54.706 --> 33:55.640
as weapons.

33:56.841 --> 33:58.077
Why?

33:58.175 --> 34:01.446
And now, I want to be good.
[chuckles]

34:02.179 --> 34:04.183
Well, maybe I'm not good.

34:04.280 --> 34:09.288
Maybe I'm, maybe I'm just bad
because everything
I ever touch turns to shite.

34:09.386 --> 34:11.890
Okay. So, when
the Doom Patrol return.

34:11.988 --> 34:16.661
If, if... the Doom Patrol
returns from wherever

34:16.760 --> 34:19.798
this fucking hell is
that I have sent them to.

34:19.897 --> 34:22.968
I'm... I'm going to
correct everything.

34:23.067 --> 34:24.303
Okay? Do you hear me?

34:24.401 --> 34:25.870
I'm going to
correct everything.

34:25.969 --> 34:31.010
And I will give Rita who
was a... a dear, dear friend--

34:31.108 --> 34:32.211
Do you know what I mean?

34:32.310 --> 34:36.076
...or whatever, toast to Rita.

34:36.179 --> 34:39.484
I'm going to give her
the position that she deserves.

34:40.718 --> 34:43.288
Team leader, right?

34:43.386 --> 34:48.460
She deserves to lead
that bunch of misfit
vagabonds, not me.

34:48.559 --> 34:50.495
Definitely not fucking me.

34:50.595 --> 34:51.496
Not me.

34:54.232 --> 34:56.468
Well, I am going to need
a bigger bottle.

34:59.303 --> 35:00.772
-That's the plan.
-[electricity crackling]

35:21.526 --> 35:22.394
Whoa.

35:44.181 --> 35:45.217
[Larry] Rita!

35:46.250 --> 35:48.387
[dramatic music playing]

35:53.490 --> 35:54.626
[Rita] My friends.

35:55.559 --> 35:57.062
You're here to save me.

35:57.161 --> 35:58.430
[Cliff] Were you in Star Trek?

35:58.529 --> 36:00.632
You never told us
you were in Star Trek.

36:00.730 --> 36:03.002
[Larry] We're in
Spartacus 452.

36:03.100 --> 36:06.538
Rita's first sci-fi movie
that, incidentally, was also
her first box office failure.

36:07.804 --> 36:09.608
But that's neither here,
nor there.

36:09.702 --> 36:11.043
Thank you, Larry.

36:11.141 --> 36:12.044
[clears throat]

36:12.143 --> 36:13.612
Now, listen to me.

36:13.710 --> 36:17.049
I appreciate you all coming,
but you are in danger.

36:17.147 --> 36:18.250
This is a trap.

36:18.349 --> 36:20.419
-We know.
-You do?

36:20.517 --> 36:22.421
[Larry] We have to save you
from Dr. Janus.

36:22.518 --> 36:26.058
She's an evil being
that has everyone trapped
in your movie retrospective.

36:26.157 --> 36:28.260
Even my new friend.

36:28.359 --> 36:30.862
-I'm sorry.
I never got your real name.
-[man] Oh.

36:32.029 --> 36:34.866
Call me Mr. One-Oh-Four.

36:39.870 --> 36:40.940
The periodic table?

36:43.803 --> 36:45.710
Seriously?

36:45.808 --> 36:49.648
[Larry] The point is,
I think this Dr. Janus wants
to collect your emotional juice

36:49.746 --> 36:51.984
and that necklace
or something like that.

36:52.081 --> 36:56.956
[laughs] Oh.
Well, she's not going
to get it in this movie.

36:57.049 --> 36:59.291
I took this role for the money.

36:59.390 --> 37:01.426
And perhaps we need
to up the stakes then.

37:02.559 --> 37:04.796
[Cliff, Jane and Larry scream]

37:04.895 --> 37:06.966
-[Larry] What the hell?
-[Cliff] What the fuck?

37:07.064 --> 37:08.228
What did you just do?

37:08.332 --> 37:10.002
Me? Nothing.

37:10.099 --> 37:13.638
I'm a man of many elements,
but this was all her.

37:13.737 --> 37:16.942
Allow me to introduce you
to Dr. Janus.

37:23.580 --> 37:25.017
-[snaps fingers]
-[Jane screams]

37:26.050 --> 37:26.885
[Cliff] Fuck!

37:30.087 --> 37:31.690
But that was all me.

37:31.788 --> 37:34.193
What are you doing?
They'll burn alive out there.

37:34.291 --> 37:36.328
I know. Isn't it a pity?

37:36.426 --> 37:37.496
[Cliff] That's your friend?

37:37.595 --> 37:39.131
Maybe you
should be by yourself.

37:39.230 --> 37:40.865
Your choices are fucked.

37:40.965 --> 37:41.901
Shut up, Cliff.

37:41.999 --> 37:43.702
We can get ourselves
out of this.

37:43.800 --> 37:47.372
So call, uh, Flit or Hammerhead
or some fucking body.

37:48.740 --> 37:49.574
[exhales]

37:52.043 --> 37:52.877
[Cliff and Larry] Um...

37:55.345 --> 37:56.982
What the fuck?

37:57.076 --> 37:59.351
-I can't.
-[Larry groans]

37:59.450 --> 38:00.986
[grunts] Nothing's happening.

38:02.486 --> 38:03.488
Break open the bars.

38:03.588 --> 38:04.723
[Cliff] Let's do this.

38:05.389 --> 38:09.361
[straining]

38:09.461 --> 38:10.429
What the fuck?

38:10.527 --> 38:11.863
Fuck, we're powerless.

38:11.957 --> 38:12.965
Now you're getting it.

38:14.565 --> 38:15.935
Why are you doing this?

38:16.028 --> 38:17.736
What did I ever do to you?

38:17.829 --> 38:21.040
You have something
that was never yours
in the first place.

38:21.138 --> 38:25.410
Something that was stolen
from someone very special.

38:25.509 --> 38:27.379
And we intend to get it back.

38:28.279 --> 38:29.581
What do I have?

38:33.050 --> 38:34.486
My emotions?

38:35.486 --> 38:36.788
Is that what you want?

38:42.226 --> 38:43.495
So what?

38:43.594 --> 38:45.297
I impassively watch
my friends burn to death

38:45.395 --> 38:47.499
or I attempt the impossible?

38:47.597 --> 38:50.330
I try to save them
and you get what you want?

38:52.737 --> 38:54.539
Fuck you! Fuck that.

38:55.973 --> 38:57.009
[breath trembles]

38:59.343 --> 39:00.612
[gasps]

39:02.946 --> 39:06.585
All of my life,
I have felt like a fraud.

39:06.684 --> 39:11.123
All of my life,
I have been the imposter
masquerading as Rita Farr.

39:11.222 --> 39:15.594
But, one day,
you crazy bunch of misfits

39:15.693 --> 39:17.862
who are just like me,
came into my life.

39:21.164 --> 39:25.938
I say fuck Niles Caulder
for most things but...
not this.

39:26.036 --> 39:27.039
He gave me you.

39:27.967 --> 39:29.874
My family.

39:29.973 --> 39:32.177
I know you don't think
we deserve anything good.

39:32.275 --> 39:37.549
But one thing I know
we do deserve is the love
that we have for each other.

39:37.648 --> 39:39.751
Well, had, before
the Butts screwed us up,

39:39.849 --> 39:41.921
and then that weird
testicle monster thing.

39:42.020 --> 39:45.690
But the point is...
you accept me.

39:45.789 --> 39:49.728
The real me,
whether I blob or triumph,

39:49.826 --> 39:51.896
you were always the place
that I returned to.

39:51.996 --> 39:53.232
You were my home.

39:53.330 --> 39:54.766
Okay, this is really beautiful,

39:54.864 --> 39:56.201
but if she doesn't hurry
the fuck up, we're gonna fry.

39:56.300 --> 39:58.938
[Rita] I've earned this family

39:59.035 --> 40:02.307
and I will be damned if I let
some D-movie villain

40:02.401 --> 40:04.843
harm you or take you
away from me.

40:04.941 --> 40:09.481
And, even though you people,
who I love more than anything
in the world,

40:09.579 --> 40:12.918
chose someone else over me
to lead you,

40:13.017 --> 40:15.988
a perfect stranger,
I might add.

40:16.087 --> 40:18.418
I would die
if anything happened to you.

40:19.923 --> 40:22.527
[exhales] I'm going
to save you. Mmm-hmm.

40:22.625 --> 40:26.131
Or we will die together
because I'm not going to live
my life without you.

40:33.337 --> 40:34.434
Bravo.

40:47.317 --> 40:49.088
Immortus will rise.

40:51.455 --> 40:53.092
[Rita] Wait, you!

40:53.190 --> 40:54.226
What did you say?

40:55.293 --> 40:57.262
Hey, that's it?

40:57.360 --> 41:00.865
You get what you want
and you still leave us here
to burn?

41:01.866 --> 41:03.402
Holy shit, we're doomed.

41:03.500 --> 41:07.139
At least you got
to have a fucking orgasm
before you die.

41:07.238 --> 41:08.107
[screams]

41:09.173 --> 41:12.511
Don't worry.
I'm coming for you.

41:12.610 --> 41:14.346
[all screaming]

41:14.444 --> 41:15.981
-[Cliff] No!
-[Larry] Rita!

41:21.385 --> 41:23.822
Oh, please. Do not let go.

41:28.226 --> 41:29.962
[Rita] Hot, hot, hot!

41:30.728 --> 41:31.830
What is that?

41:32.863 --> 41:36.068
[dramatic music playing]

41:38.102 --> 41:40.639
[Cliff] Holy fucking fuck!
Is that...

41:41.305 --> 41:42.241
[Larry] Keeg?

41:44.541 --> 41:45.945
[Jane] He's rescuing us.

41:49.347 --> 41:50.315
[Larry] Thanks, kiddo.

41:50.414 --> 41:51.511
Let's go home.

41:56.120 --> 41:57.156
Wait, don't.

41:57.588 --> 41:58.623
No!

41:59.557 --> 42:01.126
[Jane gasps]

42:01.225 --> 42:02.161
[Larry] Keeg?

42:03.194 --> 42:05.564
-[gasps] Rita!
-[Jane] Rita.

42:08.433 --> 42:09.529
Rita.

42:20.744 --> 42:24.116
-[Marcus] Man.
Good to see you, brother.
-[Vic] You too. Take care, bro.

42:25.983 --> 42:28.587
-Take it easy, man.
-One day I will.

42:33.758 --> 42:34.826
Good seeing you.

42:40.598 --> 42:41.700
Good seeing you, too.

42:51.643 --> 42:52.744
Hey!

42:56.414 --> 42:57.749
I promised to share custody.

42:59.617 --> 43:00.986
I had him
for the first ten years.

43:03.988 --> 43:05.357
You get him for the next ten.

43:10.862 --> 43:11.964
Hey, Derek.

43:15.132 --> 43:16.668
I'm forever proud of you, man.

43:28.779 --> 43:30.049
[sighs]

43:46.631 --> 43:47.766
[tires screeching]

43:47.865 --> 43:49.268
[Cliff] Get the fuck
out the way.

43:50.234 --> 43:51.971
-[door slams]
-[yelps] Oh!

43:52.069 --> 43:55.740
Fucking hell. Ow! Oh!

43:59.776 --> 44:01.513
[Cliff] Move it.
Out of the way.

44:01.613 --> 44:02.781
What's happening?

44:02.880 --> 44:03.949
[Larry] We don't know
what's going on.

44:05.916 --> 44:07.953
[dramatic music playing]
