I don't even know why,

00:20.800 --> 00:23.600
but that’s cool, because I’m just
gonna replace that with Ola...

00:23.880 --> 00:25.560
I’m trying to get my life together.

00:26.040 --> 00:28.200
I'm gonna change boyfriend.
That’ll take time. That's okay,

00:28.280 --> 00:31.080
but it will look something like that.

00:31.320 --> 00:34.320
Look, I can't be with no guy that ain't
kept a job for more than a week

00:34.400 --> 00:37.160
in his life, so this one
is gonna be smart, yeah?

00:37.240 --> 00:40.000
He’s gonna have his own place.
Drive a car like whoa.

00:40.080 --> 00:41.640
A businessman, know what I mean?

00:41.720 --> 00:45.480
He’s a tiger, but can also
be gentle, like Drake.

00:45.600 --> 00:48.520
Home is basically sorted,
I'm here, gonna surprise my Mum.

00:48.600 --> 00:51.320

01:16.160 --> 01:18.160
[Cynthia] I just need
you to enter the kitchen.

01:18.840 --> 01:20.080
[Joy] We have mice, again.

01:20.440 --> 01:23.200
If you leave food all over
the place as gifts for rodents,

01:23.400 --> 01:24.960
don't complain when they...

01:27.720 --> 01:30.760
Where were you? All I want
to know is where were you.

01:30.960 --> 01:33.400
Worshiping in Israel. I told you!

01:33.880 --> 01:35.680
-Who with?
-[sighs] Jesus!

01:35.760 --> 01:38.440
-Where in Israel?
-Where Jesus grew up, mum.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.880
-Where was that?
-Palestine.

01:43.080 --> 01:46.280
When I was a child, my mother
would always know when I was lying.

01:46.360 --> 01:48.240
-Yes, but Mummy, I'm not lying.

01:55.120 --> 01:58.600

02:11.320 --> 02:12.800

So, if you've still been
on the straight and narrow...

02:15.600 --> 02:17.560
-Yes.

02:17.640 --> 02:21.120

02:30.720 --> 02:32.720
What, that's it?
Then I can move back home?

02:33.000 --> 02:34.440
You can also heal a sick person

02:34.640 --> 02:37.560
and speak in tongues
by the power of the Holy Spirit.

02:37.960 --> 02:40.200
They are things only
the anointed can achieve.

02:40.560 --> 02:42.880
And if you succeed, it will be my proof

02:42.960 --> 02:45.480
that you are telling
the truth about your time away.

02:45.720 --> 02:50.080
And upon completion, move back home
and restore peace upon this household.

03:10.560 --> 03:13.000
I hear commands. I see strings.

03:13.280 --> 03:16.760
Mum says, "Hand out some fliers,
1,000"? Cool. That’s a string.

03:16.840 --> 03:18.680
Mum says, "Speak in tongues"?
That’s a string.

03:18.760 --> 03:20.560
Mum says, "Heal the sick"? String.

03:20.640 --> 03:23.080
Do you know what I'll do
with them strings? Pull them.

03:23.480 --> 03:26.440
Like a farmer milking
the five penises of a cow.

03:26.520 --> 03:29.960

that people that try to use

generally don't know much about it.

21:41.200 --> 21:43.080
And I loved him.

21:43.600 --> 21:45.960
That's all I needed. The truth.

21:48.840 --> 21:49.880
[sobbing laugh]

21:49.960 --> 21:51.280
Oh, Mummy.

21:55.400 --> 21:57.560
Now, speak in tongues.

21:59.880 --> 22:01.760
Uh... What?

22:01.840 --> 22:04.040
Take a leap of faith.
Just let the words out.

22:04.200 --> 22:05.560
That's all you have to do.

22:05.760 --> 22:08.800
-It doesn't matter how it sounds.
-Yeah, but I thought, now that...

22:11.560 --> 22:12.600
Um...

22:13.360 --> 22:16.080
[Italian accent] Fiato puntinana.

22:17.360 --> 22:20.720
Honda civicolo.

22:20.920 --> 22:23.680
Chevy pololo lolololo lolo.

22:25.200 --> 22:26.240
Good girl.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.360
[Candice] I shouldn't have
kicked you out, man.

22:33.440 --> 22:36.520
You would've never gone away.
I'm supposed to have your back.

22:36.600 --> 22:39.600
You do. Look at what you've
done today. If wasn't for you...

22:40.680 --> 22:42.080
Anyway, I love you.

22:47.320 --> 22:49.800
-Do you wanna go shops?
-Don't do it, Tracey.

22:51.600 --> 22:53.760
-Yeah.
