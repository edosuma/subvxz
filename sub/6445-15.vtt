WEBVTT

00:07.341 --> 00:09.002
Yeah.

00:16.058 --> 00:18.470
Okay, so maybe bowling
isn't my calling...

00:18.686 --> 00:21.644
...but it is one of the last
doctor-approved exercises left.

00:21.855 --> 00:25.439
Look, Lana, I love rolling gutter balls
just as much as the next girl...

00:25.609 --> 00:26.815
...but I've got to admit...

00:26.985 --> 00:31.069
...I expected something a little different
for the bachelorette party.

00:32.866 --> 00:34.242
Oh, nice.

00:39.415 --> 00:43.249
I know I could've invited a bunch of girls
and gone out for a night on the town...

00:43.419 --> 00:46.035
...but this is so much more special.

00:46.213 --> 00:50.456
Yeah, eating chili fries
and knocking down pins....

00:52.845 --> 00:56.554
With my best friend,
like we used to, one last time.

00:57.266 --> 00:58.472
You're getting married...

00:58.642 --> 01:02.226
-...you're not moving to Antarctica.
-l'm also having a baby.

01:02.396 --> 01:06.059
l have a feeling these girls' nights out
are gonna be a lot harder to come by.

01:06.233 --> 01:07.894
I wouldn't be so sure.

01:08.318 --> 01:11.401
Butjust in case,
let's document the night.

01:12.656 --> 01:13.736
-Okay.
-All right.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.772
-Ready?
-Yes.

01:17.327 --> 01:19.454
Cute.

01:31.633 --> 01:32.622
Yeah.

01:32.801 --> 01:36.339
One last picture of Lana Lang
before she becomes Lana Luthor.

01:36.513 --> 01:40.301
-Wow, that's weird.
-Excuse me.

01:40.559 --> 01:42.675
I couldn't help notice
your form was perfect...

01:42.853 --> 01:46.687
...but your wrist is a little off.
You think I could give you a pointer?

01:46.857 --> 01:48.688
Who's gonna man the shoe fort?

01:48.859 --> 01:51.020
I could care less.
My shift's over anyways.

01:51.195 --> 01:52.184
-Okay.
-Here.

01:52.362 --> 01:54.068
All right.

01:54.239 --> 01:57.857
Okay, you're gonna point the inside
of your elbow straight down that lane.

01:58.035 --> 02:00.947
I'll try, but don't sign me up
for the bowling league just yet.

02:01.121 --> 02:04.329
Oh, trust me.
I've got the magic touch.

02:04.500 --> 02:06.991
All right.

02:16.345 --> 02:20.179
-Oh, my God, I did it.
-Wow, nice tip.

02:20.349 --> 02:23.182
-lt's the last frame. You get to go again.
-Cool.

02:27.898 --> 02:31.061
-Remember what I said.
-Okay.

02:47.459 --> 02:49.700
-Congrats.
-Good job, Lana.

02:50.087 --> 02:53.750
Hey, why don't you give me your number,
and I'll share a few more tips?

02:53.966 --> 02:57.299
I'm not sure that
my ﬁance would approve.

02:58.053 --> 02:59.554
Yeah.

02:59.763 --> 03:02.926
-Probably not.
-Thank you.

03:04.393 --> 03:07.260
Come on, Chloe.
How about one more picture?

03:15.195 --> 03:16.605
Why here?

03:16.780 --> 03:19.567
Bowling alleys
always attract big crowds.

03:19.741 --> 03:22.528
Okay, Tobias,
it's time to take them off.

03:22.703 --> 03:24.944
Only for a second.

03:25.873 --> 03:27.613
I know it hurts.

03:37.509 --> 03:40.000
There's one right there.

04:29.853 --> 04:31.059
Help.

04:32.022 --> 04:34.889
-Hey!
-Help!

05:52.269 --> 05:54.681
I can't believe there isn't even
a skid mark outside.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.688
Maybe there's a clue here.
Sure this guy was krypto-powered?

05:57.858 --> 06:02.101
Clark, there was one pin standing,
and then, boom, it fell. All by itself.

06:02.279 --> 06:05.271
That would give someone reason
to kidnap a bowling alley employee.

06:05.449 --> 06:07.690
-Did Lana see the abduction?
-No.

06:07.868 --> 06:10.450
Speaking of, with the wedding
of the century coming up...

06:10.620 --> 06:13.657
...are you gonna be renting a tux
next weekend or a DVD?

06:13.832 --> 06:16.949
Chloe, what possible reason would I have
to watch them get married?

06:17.210 --> 06:21.123
Because if you showed up it would send
a message that you're actually moving on.

06:21.798 --> 06:26.588
You know, to Lana, to Lex,
more importantly, to yourself.

06:30.515 --> 06:32.255
So, what does this guy look like?

06:32.434 --> 06:34.390
Your bowling buddy?

06:35.270 --> 06:40.139
He's Asian, about 6 feet tall,
with an earring in his left ear.

06:42.319 --> 06:43.479
You mean like that guy?

06:44.821 --> 06:46.982
Hey, what are you doing?
We're closed.

06:47.324 --> 06:49.155
What happened to you last night?

06:55.207 --> 06:56.322
Did...?

06:56.500 --> 06:58.206
Did you and me—? Did we...?

06:58.376 --> 07:00.913
-Did we hook up?
-No.

07:01.088 --> 07:04.000
You were thrown in the back of a van
by men in black.

07:04.674 --> 07:07.962
Damn.
I thought I drank a lot last night.

07:08.512 --> 07:11.219
You sure you don't remember
getting thrown in that van?

07:11.848 --> 07:13.930
I don't remember anything.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.511
Figured I just blacked out.

07:17.646 --> 07:20.683
It was Saturday night, I wasn't driving,
so I cracked open a pint.

07:20.857 --> 07:24.645
Next thing I know I'm waking up
in bed like any other morning.

07:32.577 --> 07:36.786
Is it me, or do I look like
a waiter serving high tea?

07:36.957 --> 07:40.620
You look like the most
handsome groom in the world.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.580
Good answer.

07:49.886 --> 07:51.968
About last night.

07:52.139 --> 07:55.176
Why did Chloe go outside in the middle
of your bachelorette party?

07:56.393 --> 08:00.853
-She said she needed some air.
-In the back alley?

08:01.022 --> 08:03.764
Why not go out front
like everyone else?

08:03.942 --> 08:06.433
Lex, you seem a little obsessed
with the details.

08:08.697 --> 08:12.155
She's your maid of honor,
and she almost got run over.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.862
Lana, I wouldn't want anything
to happen to her.

08:15.036 --> 08:17.118
Neither would I.

08:20.625 --> 08:22.240
I'll see you at dinner.

08:32.137 --> 08:35.425
Dr. Bethany,
did we have an appointment?

08:35.599 --> 08:39.638
The boy is growing impatient.
He keeps asking when the surgery is.

08:40.437 --> 08:44.771
Well, tell him corneas
don't grow on trees.

08:46.193 --> 08:49.310
He's blind, Mr. Luthor. not stupid.

08:51.072 --> 08:53.449
I'm afraid if we keep stalling,
he'll start talking.

08:53.617 --> 08:55.653
You were the one
who warned a transplant...

08:55.827 --> 08:57.943
...would most likely
take away his abilities.

08:58.121 --> 09:01.329
If he tells anyone what we're doing,
my career is as good as over.

09:01.499 --> 09:04.411
-l'm the one on the line here.
-Think of your wife, doctor.

09:05.962 --> 09:07.873
If we tracked
these subjects a year ago...

09:08.048 --> 09:10.630
...she might never
have been murdered.

09:13.845 --> 09:18.680
Don't pretend that you care
about crime, Mr. Luthor.

09:18.850 --> 09:20.806
I know about your
meteor rock research.

09:20.977 --> 09:25.346
I've been victimized
by these people just like you have.

09:26.608 --> 09:29.645
Tell Tobias to be patient.

09:37.535 --> 09:39.321
Daniel may not be the only one.

09:39.496 --> 09:43.489
A mother called 911 complaining her son
disappeared in the middle of the night.

09:43.667 --> 09:46.579
But when he showed up in bed
the next morning, safe and sound...

09:46.753 --> 09:48.368
...there was no case.

09:48.546 --> 09:50.207
Son's name, Brian Osbourne.

09:50.382 --> 09:52.998
Also on the Wall of Weird,
suspected clairvoyant.

09:53.969 --> 09:55.800
People with meteor powers
are being abducted.

09:55.971 --> 09:59.304
Then released with a memory wipe
that reaches back before the abduction.

09:59.849 --> 10:03.057
The question is, what's happening
to them on their big night out?

10:03.311 --> 10:04.767
I'm guessing not a pajama party.

10:04.938 --> 10:08.146
And considering Lex's history
with 33.1, I bet he's behind this.

10:08.316 --> 10:12.685
That wouldn't be a shocker,
but this is the only clue I have.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.571
You and Lana having the time
of your lives.

10:17.742 --> 10:19.528
Be patient.

10:22.580 --> 10:24.411
See, that's Tobias Rice.

10:24.582 --> 10:26.914
He was blinded in the last meteor shower.

10:27.085 --> 10:29.872
And he's pointing directly at Daniel.

10:30.171 --> 10:34.039
Why would a blind person
point at someone?

10:35.385 --> 10:37.501
Come on in.
It's nice to hear a familiar voice.

10:37.679 --> 10:41.263
-l'm sorry about what happened to you.
-Hey, I got off lucky.

10:41.433 --> 10:44.175
My parents, not so much.

10:44.352 --> 10:47.765
Can I get you guys something to drink?
How about an iced tea?

10:48.273 --> 10:52.107
-Don't make me drink alone.
-Sure, I'll have a glass. Thanks.

10:53.236 --> 10:56.069
Tobias, you were at Smallville Lanes
last night, weren't you?

10:56.781 --> 10:58.942
You sound surprised.

10:59.117 --> 11:01.733
You were pointing at someone.
Someone named--

11:01.911 --> 11:03.492
Look, I hate to break it to you...

11:03.663 --> 11:07.076
...but in my condition, I'm not doing
too much pointing these days.

11:08.418 --> 11:12.127
Hopefully that'll change. I'm on this
waiting list for a cornea transplant.

11:15.884 --> 11:18.626
-Here, let me help you with that.
-No, I can handle it.

11:30.273 --> 11:32.355
I'm sorry.
The glass almost hit the ground.

11:32.525 --> 11:36.109
-Are you all right, Tobias?
-l'm ﬁne.

11:36.279 --> 11:40.943
It's just, when my glasses are off
I get these raging headaches from the light.

11:44.454 --> 11:46.490
Please, just go.

11:56.925 --> 11:59.086
Call me crazy,
but it was like he saw something.

11:59.260 --> 12:01.421
That's what worries me.

12:03.681 --> 12:06.673
I told you not to call me.
This had better be important, Tobias.

12:06.851 --> 12:10.014
It is. Dr. Bethany...

12:10.438 --> 12:12.474
...I found another one.

12:12.649 --> 12:16.437
I'm at the hospital now.
We 7/ deal with this later.

12:24.786 --> 12:26.697
Jimmy, okay, you win.

12:26.871 --> 12:30.830
You can come over tonight.
But I'm warning you, I have a deadline.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.788
Yeah, I like you a lot too.
Bye.

12:34.963 --> 12:36.169
Hey.

12:36.339 --> 12:39.752
-Late night nuptial emergency?
-This isn't about the wedding.

12:39.926 --> 12:41.837
I was just wondering...

12:42.011 --> 12:45.595
...did you really go outside for air last night,
or was there another reason?

12:47.976 --> 12:52.436
All right, I admit it. I was worried
that he was another Lana Lang stalker.

12:52.605 --> 12:58.441
But listen, I got my bridesmaid's dress,
and you have amazing taste.

12:59.070 --> 13:02.187
Why do I get the feeling
that you're seriously sidestepping...

13:02.365 --> 13:05.653
...any discussion
about that abduction?

13:07.662 --> 13:10.278
You think Lex had something
to do with this, don't you?

13:14.377 --> 13:16.834
Let's just say
it wouldn't be a huge leap...

13:17.005 --> 13:20.338
...considering Dan the Man
has a meteor power.

13:22.886 --> 13:26.754
It turns out that his bowling tips
came with an added advantage.

13:26.931 --> 13:30.970
Telekinesis.
And I think that's why he was abducted.

13:31.769 --> 13:34.852
But you and I both know that
just because someone has an ability...

13:35.023 --> 13:37.765
...doesn't make them a bad person.

13:37.942 --> 13:40.809
Some of these people might use
their powers to save people.

13:41.738 --> 13:43.820
Okay, I don't know
who you're talking about...

13:43.990 --> 13:48.404
...but the meteor freaks that I've met aren't
exactly in line to win a Nobel Peace Prize.

13:48.745 --> 13:51.578
These people
don't advertise their abilities.

13:51.748 --> 13:54.455
Whoever did this,
how did they ﬁgure out who to abduct?

13:54.626 --> 13:58.164
There's a kid who went to Smallville High
who was blinded in the shower...

13:58.338 --> 14:03.082
...and now he has the ability
to identify meteor freaks.

14:04.802 --> 14:07.088
What's his name?

14:11.935 --> 14:16.178
Thank you, Dr. Bethany.
I'll get the results right back to you.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.722
-Dr. Bethany?
-Yes. Can I help you?

14:19.067 --> 14:21.809
I'm friends with Tobias Rice.
He called you today.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.982
He's a patient of mine.

14:25.740 --> 14:28.072
Tobias said, "I found another one."

14:28.243 --> 14:30.859
I'm not sure what that meant,
but I'm worried about him.

14:31.746 --> 14:34.408
Well, I'm glad that Tobias
has such caring friends...

14:34.582 --> 14:38.575
...but anything said between my patients
and myself is strictly conﬁdential.

14:41.256 --> 14:44.544
What about Daniel Kim?
Is he a patient of yours?

14:46.219 --> 14:47.459
I've never heard of him.

14:47.845 --> 14:50.928
Dr. Bethany, I have something
for you to sign here.

14:51.099 --> 14:54.466
All right. Just a moment.
Oh, good the requisitions.

14:55.186 --> 14:57.472
Okay, let me just— Just let me get my--

15:02.360 --> 15:05.227
I'm so sorry.
I don't know what happened.

15:12.704 --> 15:14.740
-Where is it?
-Where's what?

15:14.914 --> 15:16.825
My computer. You took it, didn't you?

15:39.105 --> 15:40.845
Chloe?

15:41.274 --> 15:43.731
Clark, please tell me
you know where Chloe is.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.520
She's not here?

15:46.613 --> 15:49.980
No, I can't ﬁnd her. And to tell the truth,
I'm starting to freak out.

15:50.158 --> 15:52.524
She's not answering her phone.
She always answers.

15:52.702 --> 15:55.114
Wait, calm down.
When was the last time you saw her?

15:57.832 --> 16:00.039
It was at the Planet this morning.

16:00.209 --> 16:02.791
She's on a deadline.
She's supposed to be here working.

16:02.962 --> 16:06.170
If she's under a deadline,
she's probably out researching her story.

16:06.341 --> 16:10.835
On the downtown parking meters?
I don't think so.

16:12.180 --> 16:14.762
Look, I swear, Clark,
if anything happens to her—

16:14.932 --> 16:17.890
Jimmy, take this computer.
See if you can break into its ﬁles.

16:18.061 --> 16:22.680
Chloe's the one with techno skills. I'm just
a guy with a camera and a kidnapped...

16:23.566 --> 16:25.602
...girlfriend.

16:32.825 --> 16:36.534
-Where is Dr. Bethany?
-Clark?

16:36.704 --> 16:38.160
How'd you get in here?

16:38.331 --> 16:42.574
He's not at the hospital, and he's not
answering his pages. Where is he?

16:42.752 --> 16:44.492
How am I supposed to know?

16:44.671 --> 16:47.253
He kidnapped Chloe.

16:47.423 --> 16:50.665
He took my friend. Now, where is he?

16:50.843 --> 16:52.583
Kidnapped?

16:52.762 --> 16:55.970
-I don't understand.
-Tobias...

16:56.849 --> 16:57.838
...don't lie to me.

17:00.687 --> 17:03.554
He said he was helping people.

17:05.066 --> 17:08.103
He's not gonna help Chloe, Tobias.
She's a witness.

17:08.277 --> 17:09.858
God knows what he'll do to her.

17:12.448 --> 17:16.407
Look, if he took her,
it's not because she's a witness.

17:18.329 --> 17:20.490
He's trying to lure me in.

17:20.665 --> 17:22.280
You?

17:22.458 --> 17:24.835
Why would he wanna do that?

17:25.002 --> 17:27.129
Why would he take Chloe?

17:33.219 --> 17:36.052
You guys are such close friends.
I thought you knew.

17:38.433 --> 17:40.264
Knew what?

17:41.144 --> 17:43.430
She's meteor infected, Clark.

17:55.616 --> 17:57.743
Blood iron levels?

17:58.369 --> 17:59.779
Two twenty-ﬁve.

18:00.997 --> 18:04.364
Copper, creatinine
and chloride are all high.

18:05.960 --> 18:08.167
The clock is ticking.
Let's not waste time.

18:09.172 --> 18:11.663
Erythrocyte
and leukocyte counts conﬁrmed.

18:11.841 --> 18:14.833
Initializing full-body spectral scan.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.763
Scanning in progress.

18:29.859 --> 18:31.690
Vertical asymptote at X.

18:33.196 --> 18:34.686
Preparing for DNA extraction.

18:56.052 --> 18:58.043
Hello, beautiful.

18:58.221 --> 18:59.711
How are the two of you doing?

18:59.889 --> 19:02.756
Oh, we're both doing just ﬁne.

19:03.434 --> 19:06.642
Lex, have you ever heard
of Tobias Rice?

19:07.605 --> 19:09.891
No. Why?

19:10.066 --> 19:13.809
Well, I ran into him in the bowling alley.
We went to school together.

19:14.111 --> 19:16.067
He lost his vision
in the meteor shower...

19:16.239 --> 19:19.731
...and now he has this ability
to sense meteor-infected people.

19:21.953 --> 19:24.069
That's intriguing...

19:24.247 --> 19:26.408
...but why do you think I'd know him?

19:27.625 --> 19:31.083
Because I know what kinds of things
you're interested in...

19:31.254 --> 19:34.462
...and meteor powers
are high on the list.

19:35.758 --> 19:37.999
Maybe so...

19:38.177 --> 19:40.919
...but in this case
I'm afraid I'm in the dark.

19:41.097 --> 19:42.962
I've never heard of your friend.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.761
Sorry.

20:04.579 --> 20:07.787
Jimmy, any luck
with the computer?

20:07.957 --> 20:11.791
I tried every trick I know, but I'm
an amateur at the encryption game.

20:11.961 --> 20:14.998
-What about the doctor? What did he say?
-He's nowhere to be found.

20:17.258 --> 20:19.044
What if she really is gone, Clark?

20:22.346 --> 20:25.838
Look, I have never met anyone
like Chloe Sullivan, and I never will.

20:26.017 --> 20:28.474
And you know
what the most pathetic part is?

20:31.022 --> 20:34.981
Is that I was so busy
playing it cool...

20:36.861 --> 20:40.319
...that I never got to tell her
how I really, truly feel.

20:40.489 --> 20:43.196
Well, now's your chance.

20:47.121 --> 20:51.740
-Chloe. You're back.
-Jimmy, easy with the anaconda squeeze.

20:52.877 --> 20:54.583
I'm
sorry

20:54.754 --> 20:56.995
I just can't believe
that you're standing here.

20:57.173 --> 21:00.381
-Why? I live upstairs.
-Chloe...

21:01.594 --> 21:03.380
...you were abducted last night.

21:07.892 --> 21:09.382
Oh, my God.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.059
You don't remember?

21:12.229 --> 21:15.687
The last thing I remember is going to sleep,
and then I woke up in my bed.

21:16.317 --> 21:19.730
I don't understand.
Why did they take me?

21:21.155 --> 21:23.862
Because you're a witness.
They wanna shut you up.

21:29.956 --> 21:32.368
If that was the case
they wouldn't have released me.

21:32.750 --> 21:34.866
Maybe they just wanted to scare you.

21:37.630 --> 21:40.542
Look, Chloe, I'm just glad
that you're back. All right?

21:40.716 --> 21:43.753
And we have Bethany's laptop,
but all the ﬁles, they're encrypted.

21:43.928 --> 21:45.634
Maybe you can pull off a miracle.

21:50.935 --> 21:54.393
If you've come here with complaints,
they're gonna fall on deaf ears.

21:54.563 --> 21:56.394
No, this has nothing to do
with Tobias.

21:59.527 --> 22:01.438
I don't know how else to say this...

22:01.612 --> 22:05.901
...except that sensitive information
about our project has been...

22:06.075 --> 22:07.736
...misplaced.

22:17.253 --> 22:21.121
Glasses are misplaced, car keys.

22:21.465 --> 22:25.583
-Not classiﬁed information.
-Oh, I know.

22:26.095 --> 22:30.429
It seems that my laptop
was somehow stolen.

22:31.183 --> 22:33.640
On it are ﬁles that will not only...

22:35.187 --> 22:38.930
...jeopardize our project, but obliterate
my medical career in the process.

22:39.233 --> 22:42.100
Sounds like a real blunder, doctor.

22:42.945 --> 22:46.187
For your sake, I hope it hasn't gotten
into the wrong hands.

22:48.826 --> 22:50.942
For both our sakes.

22:52.163 --> 22:53.152
No.

22:53.664 --> 22:57.327
I have nothing to do with you
or your research, remember, doctor?

22:57.501 --> 23:01.665
-That was our agreement.
-I understand.

23:01.839 --> 23:04.956
But it's more than likely
that there is some mention of LuthorCorp.

23:11.724 --> 23:14.431
Then you give me no choice.

23:19.398 --> 23:24.358
-What are you implying?
-I don't tolerate loose ends, doctor.

23:25.988 --> 23:28.195
Bring me Tobias...

23:29.450 --> 23:30.656
...unharmed.

23:45.341 --> 23:46.330
Tobias.

23:48.219 --> 23:50.335
It's Lana Lang, from Smallville High.

23:52.473 --> 23:56.136
I haven't talked to this many Crows
since graduation.

23:56.936 --> 23:58.551
Come on in.

24:03.901 --> 24:07.985
-I know about your ability, Tobias.
-I wouldn't call blindness an ability.

24:08.155 --> 24:11.238
I know that you're identifying people.
People who are different.

24:11.408 --> 24:13.114
But you have to stop.

24:13.285 --> 24:16.493
Whoever's put you up to this
is exploiting your powers.

24:16.664 --> 24:19.201
I don't know
what you're talking about.

24:19.375 --> 24:20.706
I have money.

24:20.876 --> 24:23.618
I can put you on a plane.
We can get you far away from here.

24:23.796 --> 24:26.037
I'm not going anywhere.

24:26.382 --> 24:28.213
I'm in line for a cornea transplant.

24:28.884 --> 24:30.215
Okay.

24:30.386 --> 24:32.718
Then you can get
the surgery somewhere else...

24:32.888 --> 24:35.345
...where there aren't
any strings attached.

24:35.516 --> 24:37.222
I'll make sure of it.

24:37.393 --> 24:38.883
Why would you do that for me?

24:40.271 --> 24:44.765
Because you may be putting someone
at risk who saves people's lives...

24:44.942 --> 24:47.854
...on practically a daily basis.

24:48.028 --> 24:50.565
I can't let that happen.

24:52.908 --> 24:54.364
Who told you about me?

24:54.827 --> 24:56.488
Clark Kent?

24:58.914 --> 24:59.994
Clark was here?

25:00.416 --> 25:01.747
You seem surprised.

25:02.835 --> 25:04.700
Did you tell anyone about him?

25:05.212 --> 25:06.668
What's to tell?

25:08.007 --> 25:11.124
Tobias, it's okay, you can trust me.

25:11.302 --> 25:14.339
I know that Clark's infected.

25:14.513 --> 25:18.051
You must be talking
about a different Clark Kent.

25:18.559 --> 25:22.643
Because the Clark I know
is the most normal guy I've ever met.

25:42.666 --> 25:45.078
All the ﬁles are barricaded.

25:45.252 --> 25:48.244
But in every wall
there's a door somewhere.

25:48.839 --> 25:51.751
What's more impenetrable
is the way you keep staring at me.

25:51.926 --> 25:56.010
-Do I have something on my face?
-No. No.

25:56.180 --> 25:57.886
I'm just relieved.

25:58.057 --> 26:00.469
We were all really worried
about you.

26:02.394 --> 26:05.431
Nice try, Clark. Cough it up.

26:06.565 --> 26:08.647
-Cough what up?
-You know the real reason...

26:08.817 --> 26:11.194
...why I was abducted, don't you?

26:13.822 --> 26:17.155
I'm some kind of meteor freak,
aren't I?

26:19.828 --> 26:21.819
We don't know that, Chloe.

26:29.755 --> 26:32.167
Well, maybe this will help
demystify things for us.

26:35.177 --> 26:36.462
We're in.

26:38.973 --> 26:42.181
-That's a map of Smallville.
-With a GPS overlay.

26:43.769 --> 26:48.183
Clark, I think Dr. Bethany
is tracking meteor freaks.

26:48.357 --> 26:49.688
Now, the question is, why?

26:51.026 --> 26:53.312
Maybe to observe them
in their own environment.

26:54.446 --> 26:56.186
Just got off the phone
with the Planet.

26:56.365 --> 27:00.199
Daniel Kim was killed in a car accident
outside Smallville Lanes 15 minutes ago.

27:01.245 --> 27:03.702
Or someone tried to make it look
like a car crash.

27:07.876 --> 27:11.414
There's a new red dot on the street
just outside the bowling alley.

27:11.588 --> 27:14.170
That red dot must be Daniel Kim.

27:15.050 --> 27:18.417
And a blinking green one
just turned red in Granville.

27:18.595 --> 27:22.338
Chloe, they're killing
these people one by one.

27:28.856 --> 27:30.938
There's a green dot in the Talon.

27:32.985 --> 27:34.521
What's going on here?

27:34.695 --> 27:36.060
Chloe, are you okay?

27:37.448 --> 27:40.406
Yeah, I'm ﬁne. I need you
to go to the Smallville Lanes...

27:40.576 --> 27:42.612
...ﬁnd out everything
about Daniel's death.

27:42.786 --> 27:44.742
-l'|l call when I get there.
-Okay, thanks.

27:51.253 --> 27:52.914
Clark, I need you to x-ray me.

27:54.256 --> 27:56.167
-What?
-Clark, come on, we're both adults.

27:56.342 --> 27:57.377
Now, just do it.

27:59.636 --> 28:00.762
Okay.

28:15.569 --> 28:18.732
There, underneath your collarbone.

28:18.906 --> 28:19.986
What is it?

28:20.616 --> 28:23.779
-I don't know.
-Please, Clark...

28:23.952 --> 28:25.112
...I don't wanna die.

28:28.457 --> 28:29.993
Just get it out of me!

28:30.167 --> 28:31.703
We have to get you to a hospital.

28:31.877 --> 28:35.210
Clark, there's something inside of me.
I don't wanna go to the ER...

28:35.381 --> 28:39.499
...and wait for the doctors
to ﬁgure out what it's gonna do to me.

28:40.135 --> 28:41.591
How accurate's your heat vision?

28:41.929 --> 28:44.386
-Chloe, don't even go there.
-ls it pinpoint accurate?

28:44.556 --> 28:47.969
-Chloe, I'm not gonna burn you.
-Clark, Daniel Kim is dead.

28:48.143 --> 28:51.306
And every single one of those green dots
is turning red one by one.

28:51.480 --> 28:53.812
I will not be the next red dot!

28:56.485 --> 28:59.773
Fine, if you're not gonna do it,
then I'll just do it myself.

29:00.739 --> 29:04.652
Chloe, wait, wait.
Just hold on a second.

29:06.829 --> 29:08.490
Do it.

29:10.916 --> 29:12.952
All right.

29:16.338 --> 29:18.249
Hold on to me.

29:19.716 --> 29:22.674
-You can't move.
-Okay.

29:33.063 --> 29:34.269
All right.

29:36.191 --> 29:39.024
-l'm sorry.
-Just get it out!

29:40.571 --> 29:42.562
It's a GPS device. That's all it is.

29:48.203 --> 29:50.694
And my green dot's gone red.

29:55.335 --> 29:58.293
In high school, I assumed the only thing
Lana Lang cared about...

29:58.464 --> 30:02.673
-...was lip gloss and pompons.
-You didn't know me very well.

30:02.843 --> 30:05.380
Well, I'm sorry for ever thinking that.

30:05.554 --> 30:07.260
Tobias.

30:08.265 --> 30:09.380
Where are you going?

30:12.728 --> 30:14.559
What's she doing here?

30:15.230 --> 30:18.222
-He's coming with me.
-Why would he do that?

30:19.234 --> 30:21.270
I have to take him
to the medical center.

30:22.321 --> 30:24.232
Tobias...

30:24.656 --> 30:26.738
...the time has ﬁnally come.

30:26.909 --> 30:29.241
We're prepping you for surgery.

30:29.578 --> 30:31.819
Just like I promised.

30:35.209 --> 30:37.791
Let me get my jacket.

30:38.212 --> 30:40.749
Tobias, you can get
the surgery somewhere else.

30:42.007 --> 30:43.998
It's okay, Lana.

30:51.517 --> 30:52.632
Tobias.

30:59.107 --> 31:03.441
-What the heck did you do to my girl, Kent?
-Jimmy, there was a tracking device in me.

31:03.612 --> 31:06.274
-Clark had a pocketknife.
-We improvised.

31:06.448 --> 31:08.939
-lmprovised?
-Jimmy, it barely even stung.

31:16.250 --> 31:20.243
There's only one green dot left,
off Highway 52.

31:21.296 --> 31:23.287
Tobias.

31:23.924 --> 31:25.460
Tobias?

31:26.385 --> 31:29.297
The powers that be
want me to take you to them...

31:29.471 --> 31:32.429
...but if I do that I'm a dead man.

31:33.559 --> 31:35.675
So if anyone asks...

31:35.852 --> 31:37.934
...you just disappeared.

31:38.313 --> 31:39.598
Please, don't hurt him.

31:42.526 --> 31:44.266
Don't worry.

31:45.320 --> 31:49.609
This amount of voltage will stop the heart
immediately. He won't feel a thing.

31:51.451 --> 31:53.658
And neither will you.

31:55.330 --> 31:57.321
But you will.

32:01.336 --> 32:03.998
I always thought my father
had too many guns in the house.

32:04.172 --> 32:06.834
-And now I'm glad he did.
-Tobias...

32:07.259 --> 32:09.545
...what good is a gun if you can't see?

32:14.182 --> 32:17.310
But I can hear,
and the next one's going in your heart.

32:31.992 --> 32:34.358
-Tobias, go. Go now.
-Stop!

32:34.536 --> 32:35.696
Don't move.

32:36.038 --> 32:37.994
Drop it.

32:38.832 --> 32:42.040
Put it down or I swear to God
I'll pull the trigger.

32:42.210 --> 32:44.041
I think I'll take my chances.

33:10.364 --> 33:11.399
What happened?

33:15.369 --> 33:17.405
I'm not sure.

33:17.579 --> 33:19.820
But we're safe now.

33:26.421 --> 33:27.922
Are you okay?

33:28.965 --> 33:30.751
I think so.

33:31.259 --> 33:34.092
We gotta call the police.

34:13.677 --> 34:14.666
Excuse me.

34:14.845 --> 34:17.257
-Do you have someone who can assist you?
-I can.

34:17.431 --> 34:19.547
-Clark?
-Yeah.

34:20.767 --> 34:22.974
The deputies told me what happened.
Are you okay?

34:23.145 --> 34:25.056
I should've known what was going on.

34:25.230 --> 34:27.721
I wanted my sight back so badly
I never questioned it.

34:27.899 --> 34:30.231
It's okay. It's all over now.

34:30.402 --> 34:33.144
A friend of mine's gonna
get you your operation.

34:33.321 --> 34:37.360
-You'll be safe.
-Lana wanted to do the same thing for me.

34:38.118 --> 34:39.153
Lana?

34:41.496 --> 34:42.485
Why?

34:42.664 --> 34:46.327
She had this crazy notion
that you were infected by the meteors.

34:46.835 --> 34:49.577
And she didn't want me
to tell anybody else.

34:50.964 --> 34:52.500
Really?

34:53.341 --> 34:55.923
-What'd you tell her?
-The truth.

34:58.638 --> 35:01.505
That you're the most normal guy
I've ever met.

35:11.693 --> 35:13.479
The ride's here.

35:14.070 --> 35:15.731
Thanks, Clark.

35:15.906 --> 35:17.521
For everything.

35:25.540 --> 35:27.451
Thank you.

35:30.629 --> 35:36.249
Once again, fate intervenes
and lives are miraculously saved.

35:39.387 --> 35:40.547
Yeah.

35:40.764 --> 35:43.130
The paramedics said
he died of a heart attack.

35:43.308 --> 35:45.219
It's bizarre.

35:47.145 --> 35:49.477
What's really bizarre is this.

35:54.945 --> 35:59.063
I ﬁred the gun, but the bullet smashed
into the cabinet behind me.

36:00.367 --> 36:02.528
It must have ricocheted.

36:03.453 --> 36:06.320
Off of something pretty powerful.

36:08.917 --> 36:11.329
The important thing
is that you're okay.

36:14.297 --> 36:16.583
Where did Tobias go?

36:16.758 --> 36:17.918
Star City.

36:18.093 --> 36:21.927
Oliver Queen is arranging for him
to get his cornea transplant.

36:22.806 --> 36:24.296
Lana".

36:24.474 --> 36:27.887
...Tobias told me
what you were gonna do for me.

36:31.147 --> 36:34.890
I'm not sure where you got this idea
that l was meteor infected...

36:35.902 --> 36:39.645
...but I appreciate you looking out
for me. It means a lot.

36:44.953 --> 36:46.693
You know...

36:48.331 --> 36:53.792
...even if it were true,
even if you were meteor infected...

36:53.962 --> 36:56.169
...it wouldn't matter.

36:56.756 --> 36:59.793
You'd still be the same Clark Kent.

37:07.642 --> 37:09.018
Miss Lang?

37:09.185 --> 37:11.597
Are you ready
to ﬁnish your statement?

37:34.544 --> 37:36.205
Lana.

37:37.714 --> 37:40.171
Thank God you're all right.

37:46.598 --> 37:48.680
What were you doing
at that kid's house?

37:48.850 --> 37:50.681
I was trying to save him.

37:51.436 --> 37:52.846
You should've come to me.

37:53.355 --> 37:56.267
I didn't know it was gonna
turn out that way.

37:58.443 --> 38:02.277
Lex, that doctor,
I saw you meeting with him.

38:04.199 --> 38:06.565
Of course you did.

38:06.993 --> 38:11.987
I was talking to Bethany about LuthorCorp's
donation to the new trauma center.

38:15.877 --> 38:18.118
So it was just a coincidence
that he was here?

38:18.880 --> 38:20.916
A sad one.

38:21.883 --> 38:26.547
Who would've ever thought that a man
whose job it is to save lives...

38:26.721 --> 38:29.007
...would do something like this?

38:31.643 --> 38:35.056
Lex, if you were involved in this
you'd tell me, wouldn't you?

38:38.733 --> 38:40.564
Lana".

38:41.027 --> 38:43.689
...you're my bride-to-be.

38:44.072 --> 38:46.905
-The mother of my--
-Tell me the truth, Lex.

38:49.077 --> 38:52.240
On the soul of my unborn child...

38:52.414 --> 38:54.746
...I swear...

38:55.417 --> 38:57.749
...it's the truth.

39:24.821 --> 39:26.777
You look dazed and confused.
Are you okay?

39:30.952 --> 39:33.409
I can't sleep.

39:33.747 --> 39:38.582
I can't work.
I can't think about anything else.

39:45.008 --> 39:47.169
You've been through a lot.

39:47.802 --> 39:50.293
There's a reason they took me.

39:50.472 --> 39:53.714
And we both know
it's not because I was a witness.

39:54.059 --> 39:57.643
Tobias didn't identify you, Clark,
because you're not a meteor freak.

39:58.730 --> 40:00.140
It was me.

40:03.151 --> 40:06.484
-Chloe, it must have been a mistake.
-How do you know that?

40:10.075 --> 40:14.444
It's not that much of a stretch to think that
I could've been infected along the way.

40:14.621 --> 40:16.828
But you don't have any powers.

40:17.874 --> 40:18.863
Do you?

40:19.959 --> 40:22.041
No, but that doesn't rule me out.

40:22.212 --> 40:24.954
There's a percentage
of the Wall of Weird that were latent.

40:25.131 --> 40:27.838
They didn't exhibit any powers
until long after exposure.

40:28.009 --> 40:29.840
Okay.

40:30.011 --> 40:31.421
All right, let's say it's true.

40:31.596 --> 40:35.180
But who's to say you're ever gonna
develop any powers at all?

40:37.936 --> 40:41.178
All I know is that every single
meteor freak I've ever run into...

40:41.356 --> 40:44.018
...has ended up either dead
or in Belle Reve.

40:46.861 --> 40:49.113
Face it, Clark.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.692
I'm a walking time bomb.

41:06.965 --> 41:10.378
Well, then consider me
your own personal bomb squad.

41:37.787 --> 41:40.870
Regarding our most recent subject...

42:32.508 --> 42:34.499
