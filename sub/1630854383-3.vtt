00:02.517 --> 00:03.793
<i>Previously on</i> The Amazing Race...

00:03.896 --> 00:06.965
<i>11 teams raced
to Innsbruck, Austria.</i>

00:07.068 --> 00:09.862
<i>Quinton and Mattie
got off to a rocky start.</i>

00:09.965 --> 00:12.206
We were looking
for a location in Munich,

00:12.310 --> 00:13.344
but it's actually in Austria.

00:13.448 --> 00:15.620
Rookie mistake.

00:15.724 --> 00:19.310
<i>At the Roadblock,
Claire was out of tune.</i>

00:21.137 --> 00:22.689
No?

00:22.793 --> 00:24.896
<i>Military brothers
Marcus and Michael</i>

00:25.000 --> 00:26.827
<i>were out of sync
at the Detour...</i>

00:26.931 --> 00:28.137
- Are you good?
- Did I mess up again?

00:28.241 --> 00:29.172
You didn't even go.

00:29.275 --> 00:30.827
<i>...but still found a way to win.</i>

00:30.931 --> 00:32.379
Yes.

00:32.482 --> 00:33.896
Brother, we did it!

00:34.000 --> 00:35.310
<i>In a wild finish...</i>

00:35.413 --> 00:37.034
I got it. I got it.

00:37.137 --> 00:38.724
I got it in my hand.
I have it in my hand. Come on.

00:38.827 --> 00:40.620
Okay. We're good.
We are close.

00:40.724 --> 00:43.241
<i>...Quinton and Mattie
staged a comeback.</i>

00:44.068 --> 00:45.068
It's near perfect.

00:46.413 --> 00:48.620
<i>And it was Tim and Rex</i>

00:48.724 --> 00:49.965
<i>who fell short at the goal line.</i>

00:54.275 --> 00:56.862
All teams are now boarding <i>
The Amazing Race</i> charter

00:56.965 --> 00:58.896
and heading to the Boot,

00:59.000 --> 01:02.206
commonly known as Italy.

01:14.827 --> 01:18.275
After touching down in Bologna,
teams will begin a Mega Leg--

01:18.379 --> 01:21.413
two Detours,
two Roadblocks, two cities.

01:21.517 --> 01:25.413
At the end of it all,
another team will be eliminated.

01:27.413 --> 01:29.724
"Route Info.
Welcome to Bologna, Italy

01:29.827 --> 01:31.310
"and your very first Mega Leg.

01:31.413 --> 01:34.931
<i>Drive to Arco del Meloncello
to find your next clue."</i>

01:35.034 --> 01:35.931
Let's do it.

01:36.034 --> 01:37.137
<i>We're leaving in the first group</i>

01:37.241 --> 01:38.310
<i>with Glenda and Lumumba.</i>

01:38.413 --> 01:40.068
<i>We did come in first last leg,</i>

01:40.172 --> 01:41.482
<i>and we don't want, like,
ups and downs.</i>

01:41.586 --> 01:44.448
We just kind of want
to stay here, but here,

01:44.551 --> 01:46.103
<i>- at a high level.</i>
- Mega Leg. Yeah.

01:46.206 --> 01:47.379
Okay. Go ahead, baby.

01:47.482 --> 01:48.344
- Go ahead.
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:48.448 --> 01:49.517
You know this a stick, now.

01:49.620 --> 01:50.862
Okay, I got you.

01:50.965 --> 01:53.068
<i>We have been married one year.</i>

01:53.172 --> 01:55.448
We've known each other only
two and a half years total.

01:55.551 --> 01:56.724
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:56.827 --> 01:58.689
So this has been
a great opportunity for us

01:58.793 --> 02:01.862
<i>to learn how to communicate
and work, uh, with each other.</i>

02:01.965 --> 02:03.724
<i>All right,
and we're heading downhill.</i>

02:03.827 --> 02:06.206
<i>I'm feeling great about
my stick shift driving skills.</i>

02:07.689 --> 02:10.172
Uh... and then I stall.

02:11.758 --> 02:13.068
It's fine, baby.

02:14.068 --> 02:15.068
Yeah.

02:16.586 --> 02:17.862
All right. Now we're down.

02:17.965 --> 02:19.793
As soon as I say that, I stall.

02:21.620 --> 02:22.827
Yo.

02:22.931 --> 02:25.103
Make a left. It's Irma Bandiera.
Uh, right there.

02:25.206 --> 02:27.344
And we should see, uh,
the marked parking spots.

02:27.448 --> 02:29.758
<i>Parking. I see it. I see it.</i>

02:31.551 --> 02:33.034
<i>You think it's up here?</i>

02:34.551 --> 02:35.655
<i>Yeah. "Detour.</i>

02:35.758 --> 02:37.793
Head of the Class
or the Big Cheese."

02:37.896 --> 02:41.793
<i>This is the oldest
university in the Western world.</i>

02:41.896 --> 02:45.137
Famous for
this anatomical theater.

02:45.241 --> 02:48.241
This is where thousands
of medical students boned up

02:48.344 --> 02:51.793
on their human anatomy
before becoming doctors.

02:51.896 --> 02:54.689
After listening
to this 16th century lecturer,

02:54.793 --> 02:58.482
<i>teams will travel to the
courtyard to take a timed exam.</i>

02:58.586 --> 03:02.586
<i>They must
identify 16 bones, muscles</i>

03:02.689 --> 03:05.034
<i>and organs in under 90 seconds.</i>

03:05.137 --> 03:06.448
If they fail the exam...

03:06.551 --> 03:07.551
No.

03:07.655 --> 03:09.137
<i>...they must go back to class.</i>

03:09.241 --> 03:12.620
<i>Once they pass the test,
they'll get their next clue.</i>

03:15.379 --> 03:17.275
The two most popular
cheeses in Italy,

03:17.379 --> 03:20.931
mozzarella
and Parmigiano-Reggiano--

03:21.034 --> 03:24.034
which is cut from
massive cheese wheels like this

03:24.137 --> 03:27.172
that weigh in
at a staggering 88 pounds.

03:27.275 --> 03:30.172
The best way to move
these massive fromage wheels

03:30.275 --> 03:32.931
around town
is on a cart like this.

03:33.034 --> 03:36.137
<i>Teams will carry their cheese
to a restaurant,</i>

03:36.241 --> 03:37.275
<i>where they'll have
their wheels sliced</i>

03:37.379 --> 03:39.689
<i>by a professional cheese cutter.</i>

03:39.793 --> 03:42.724
<i>Then they must deliver
both halves to two restaurants</i>

03:42.827 --> 03:46.137
<i>and bring their receipts
back here for a clue.</i>

03:46.241 --> 03:48.275
- Come on, let's go.
- We're gonna do
the Big Cheese.

03:48.379 --> 03:50.137
<i>We're both smart enough
to do the Head of the Class</i>

03:50.241 --> 03:53.241
<i>and knock it out,
but 88 pounds of cheese.</i>

03:53.344 --> 03:54.758
It's nothing.

03:54.862 --> 03:56.172
Anatomy lesson.

03:56.275 --> 03:58.206
All right, let's go to school.

03:58.310 --> 04:00.448
"For both Detours,
drive yourselves

04:00.551 --> 04:01.758
to Piazza Franklin
Delano Roosevelt."

04:01.862 --> 04:03.310
- All right.
- All right.

04:04.413 --> 04:05.896
Got to go on foot.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.034
Can't be too far
if it's walking distance.

04:08.137 --> 04:10.310
Oh. They're supposed to drive,
as well.

04:10.413 --> 04:11.586
<i>All right, babe.</i>

04:11.689 --> 04:12.965
Other teams
are about to start coming.

04:13.068 --> 04:13.965
I know. I know.

04:14.068 --> 04:15.103
<i>I know, I know.</i>

04:17.482 --> 04:18.724
Mega Leg!

04:18.827 --> 04:19.896
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Let's do it.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.758
We are leaving
in group two today

04:21.862 --> 04:23.000
<i>with Linton and Sharik,</i>

04:23.103 --> 04:25.034
Abby and Will,
and Luis and Michelle.

04:26.068 --> 04:27.551
- Yeah.
- Whew. Let's go.

04:27.655 --> 04:29.931
Last leg, we were battling
from the back of the pack,

04:30.034 --> 04:32.034
<i>uh, because of
my yodeling ability.</i>

04:32.137 --> 04:33.862
But everyone's time
is limited on this race,

04:33.965 --> 04:36.034
<i>so we want to focus
on really enjoying it,</i>

04:36.137 --> 04:37.862
being in the moment and also
winning. That wouldn't,

04:37.965 --> 04:39.758
- that wouldn't hurt either.
- I just want
to focus on winning.

04:39.862 --> 04:41.931
Man, I haven't driven
a stick shift in a while.

04:42.034 --> 04:44.517
- You're killing it, though.
- Yeah.

04:44.620 --> 04:46.000
- We got this!
- Whoa.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.344
That's too much energy?
- That was a lot.

04:48.448 --> 04:49.827
Yep.
That was a lot of energy.

04:49.931 --> 04:51.344
<i>There we go. Good job.</i>

04:51.448 --> 04:52.827
Okay, now we're in second...

04:52.931 --> 04:54.655
- Nice.
- ...gear.

04:54.758 --> 04:56.206
I think it was back there.

04:56.310 --> 04:57.275
Yeah, we have to go forward
and turn around.

04:57.379 --> 04:58.862
Oh, crap.

04:58.965 --> 05:01.000
All right,
so this is gonna be fun.

05:01.103 --> 05:03.137
I have no idea
how to reverse this.

05:03.241 --> 05:04.793
Is that it? No.

05:04.896 --> 05:06.827
That's first. Oh, God.

05:06.931 --> 05:08.482
<i>We couldn't figure out
how to reverse.</i>

05:08.586 --> 05:09.793
Classic <i>Amazing Race.</i>

05:09.896 --> 05:10.965
Oh, my God.

05:12.620 --> 05:14.206
All right, baby.
You got to get out and push.

05:15.310 --> 05:17.689
:
Push it!

05:19.758 --> 05:21.241
Good. We're good.

05:22.241 --> 05:24.344
Yeah, baby.

05:39.413 --> 05:40.482
This doesn't feel right.

05:40.586 --> 05:41.482
I have no idea where we are.

05:41.586 --> 05:42.689
We're just gonna keep going.

05:42.793 --> 05:44.517
Can't be too far
from where we were, babe.

05:44.620 --> 05:46.241
- That's okay.
It's pretty far.
- We have to do this on foot.

05:46.344 --> 05:47.862
We're gonna make
this left right here.

05:47.965 --> 05:49.172
<i>Oh, my God. Yes.</i>

05:49.275 --> 05:50.896
- We're gonna do Big Cheese.
- Yeah.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.103
- Head of the Class.
- We're doing Head of the Class.

05:52.206 --> 05:53.241
We're gonna do
Head of the Class.

05:53.344 --> 05:54.241
I think we can do
the Big Cheese.

05:54.344 --> 05:55.448
Okay, let's do the Big Cheese.

05:55.551 --> 05:56.241
Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

05:56.344 --> 05:57.275
Is this it?

05:57.379 --> 05:59.758
Uh... I don't know.

05:59.862 --> 06:01.137
Oh, I see the parking.

06:01.241 --> 06:02.655
- This one right here?
- Right here.

06:02.758 --> 06:03.586
- Then we do it on foot.
- Let's get this knocked out,

06:03.689 --> 06:04.862
so we can get out of here.

06:07.379 --> 06:09.137
- Let's do this, babe.
- Love and light.

06:09.241 --> 06:10.724
Mega Leg!

06:10.827 --> 06:12.827
<i>We are getting along
like we've been sisters</i>

06:12.931 --> 06:15.344
for our entire lives,
which we technically have been.

06:15.448 --> 06:18.103
Yes. The one thing
that we have consistently

06:18.206 --> 06:19.724
<i>had trouble with
is our confidence.</i>

06:19.827 --> 06:22.310
I'm in neutral.

06:22.413 --> 06:26.034
So I think we need to trust
ourselves a little bit more.

06:26.137 --> 06:27.793
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Ooh, bicycles.

06:27.896 --> 06:30.206
<i>Oh, I just stalled. Oops.</i>

06:30.310 --> 06:31.482
They just stalled, too.

06:31.586 --> 06:33.206
Clutch. Turn it on.

06:33.310 --> 06:35.000
You need the clutch. Turn it on.

06:35.103 --> 06:37.689
Okay, babe, show 'em
what your stick driving can do.

06:37.793 --> 06:39.310
<i>Why are we backed up?</i>

06:39.413 --> 06:41.172
- I think 'cause
it keeps stalling.
- Oh.

06:41.275 --> 06:43.344
Come on, Quinton, don't rush.
You got it.

06:43.448 --> 06:45.862
<i>Okay, I really wish
there was not a car here.</i>

06:45.965 --> 06:47.344
Oh, my God.

06:47.448 --> 06:49.000
<i>What am I doing wrong?</i>

06:49.103 --> 06:50.448
Yeah, they are struggling bad.

06:53.103 --> 06:54.827
<i>- Just breathe.
- Sweet spot on neutral.</i>

06:54.931 --> 06:57.586
Just don't lift off too soon.

06:57.689 --> 06:59.482
Yikes.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.413
See where they're going?
You got it, babe.

07:04.482 --> 07:06.068
<i>We are leaving
group number three.</i>

07:06.172 --> 07:08.206
We're in the back right now,
but today is our anniversary,

07:08.310 --> 07:10.758
so we got to fight hard
to stay in it and win it for us.

07:10.862 --> 07:13.551
You'll-you'll get used to it.
You'll adjust.

07:13.655 --> 07:15.793
Yep. Good job, baby.
You're making headway.

07:15.896 --> 07:17.862
Racing on our anniversary
means everything to us.

07:17.965 --> 07:19.551
Don't worry.
Don't-don't get frustrated.

07:19.655 --> 07:21.068
Okay, sweetie.

07:21.172 --> 07:22.931
<i>But, uh, the Mega Leg
is two of everything--</i>

07:23.034 --> 07:25.896
two Roadblocks,
two Detours, two cities.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.620
<i>It's going to be
a powerful opportunity for us</i>

07:28.724 --> 07:30.758
to become
the best versions of ourselves.

07:30.862 --> 07:33.068
Here we go, my love. See? Don't
allow things to frustrate you.

07:33.172 --> 07:34.482
- Right.
- It's just an object.

07:34.586 --> 07:36.000
Objects can be manipulated.

07:36.103 --> 07:37.827
Oh, it's a market over here, Marcus.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.172
- Good eye. <i>
- So, for the Big Cheese Detour...</i>

07:41.275 --> 07:43.034
- Here we go. <i>
- ...we showed up at...</i>

07:43.137 --> 07:44.896
Forma... "For" something.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.068
I'm just gonna call him
the cheese-meister.

07:47.172 --> 07:48.793
<i>- Buongiorno.</i>
- <i>Buongiorno.</i>

07:48.896 --> 07:52.172
<i>He gave us
the 88-pound block of cheese.</i>

07:52.275 --> 07:54.655
We're gonna deliver
half of it to one restaurant,

07:54.758 --> 07:57.896
other half another restaurant,
and go back to the start point.

08:00.379 --> 08:02.206
<i>Scusi. Scusi.</i>

08:02.310 --> 08:03.517
Oh. Carts are outside.

08:04.620 --> 08:05.827
Those wooden ones?

08:05.931 --> 08:07.344
- Yeah. Okay.
- Yeah. Right here.

08:07.448 --> 08:09.103
- Just this closest one to us
right here.
- Okay.

08:09.206 --> 08:10.103
All right.

08:10.206 --> 08:11.655
So left, right on San Giorgio.

08:11.758 --> 08:12.758
- Left, Volturno.
- Left, right.

08:12.862 --> 08:14.965
Keep going. Keep straight.

08:15.068 --> 08:16.448
We need some directions.

08:16.551 --> 08:17.620
Can you, can you follow?

08:17.724 --> 08:19.551
- Please.
- My God. I'm saying,

08:19.655 --> 08:21.275
- I don't know what we're doing.
- Excuse me.
Uh, directions?

08:21.379 --> 08:23.655
Sorry, folks.

08:23.758 --> 08:24.896
<i>...autobus.</i>

08:25.000 --> 08:26.689
- Okay, so, where? Where? <i>
- Autobus.</i>

08:26.793 --> 08:29.413
Uh-huh. Okay.

08:29.517 --> 08:31.896
Okay. Thank you. Thank you.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.172
Why are you stopping
to ask somebody directions

08:34.275 --> 08:35.758
if you know where you're going?

08:35.862 --> 08:36.896
You said
you know where you're going.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.586
You said, "Yes,"
and I said, "Okay."

08:38.689 --> 08:40.482
- Okay.
- Did I say,
"No, I don't think you do"?

08:40.586 --> 08:42.827
- No, I didn't.
- Okay, baby. All right.
Just roll with me.

08:42.931 --> 08:46.379
So, we're moving this cheese.
It's 88 pounds.

08:46.482 --> 08:47.655
We're going
to our first restaurant.

08:47.758 --> 08:49.413
Go over here.

08:49.517 --> 08:50.655
- Good?
- Yeah, I'm good.

08:50.758 --> 08:51.724
One, two, three.

08:51.827 --> 08:52.724
Go.

08:57.275 --> 08:58.482
Big Cheese!

08:58.586 --> 08:59.862
<i>Let's do it.</i>

08:59.965 --> 09:01.241
We're gonna do
Head of the Class.

09:01.344 --> 09:02.551
- Head of the Class?

09:02.655 --> 09:03.896
- Okay.
- Okay.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.241
- Head of the Class.
- Head of the Class.

09:05.344 --> 09:07.379
- Do the, uh, anatomy one.
- Okay. Okay.

09:08.379 --> 09:09.517
- Honestly, stay over here.
- I'm through it, I'm through it.

09:09.620 --> 09:10.655
- All right.
- Keep going.

09:10.758 --> 09:12.137
It's gonna be on the left.

09:12.241 --> 09:13.344
What's the restaurant?

09:13.448 --> 09:15.655
Volturno 5. Ristorante Diana.

09:15.758 --> 09:17.103
I see, I see Diana.

09:17.206 --> 09:18.793
- That white sign
up there on the left.
- Yeah.

09:18.896 --> 09:20.275
<i>Buongiorno.</i>

09:20.379 --> 09:22.241
One, two, three.

09:24.241 --> 09:25.620
So the cheese cutter will cut
the cheese wheel in half,

09:25.724 --> 09:27.275
- leave half the cheese wheel...
- Here?

09:27.379 --> 09:29.034
Uh-huh. And then we'll get
a receipt when he's done,

09:29.137 --> 09:31.586
and then we'll deliver the rest
of it to Osteria del Cappello.

09:31.689 --> 09:33.000
- You want to look that up?
- Yeah.

09:33.103 --> 09:34.379
Let's make a left
on the big street.

09:34.482 --> 09:36.344
Can you do it on your own,
or no?

09:36.448 --> 09:38.724
- Yeah, I think
it'll be all right.
- Careful, babe. Don't drop it.

09:38.827 --> 09:41.034
<i>Teatro Anatomy.</i>

09:41.137 --> 09:42.275
<i>Right here.</i>

09:42.379 --> 09:43.758
- Yeah.
- It's a nice building.

09:43.862 --> 09:45.620
This is giving me
heavy church vibes.

09:53.103 --> 09:54.137
Hello.

09:54.241 --> 09:56.931
Welcome. I'm Professor Fontana.

09:57.034 --> 10:00.103
- Okay.
- Class
is about to begin.

10:01.137 --> 10:04.758
<i>The body is a fascinating
piece of machinery</i>

10:04.862 --> 10:09.000
with many parts and pieces
that function in harmony.

10:09.103 --> 10:12.896
In this class, you will learn
the anatomy of the human body,

10:13.000 --> 10:17.344
including bones,
organs and muscles.

10:17.448 --> 10:20.413
We start with the bones
of the skull, which provide

10:20.517 --> 10:21.724
a safety cage for the brain...

10:21.827 --> 10:24.275
The frontal bone
for the main part of the...

10:24.379 --> 10:27.896
The zygomatic bone protect
the eye and the optic nerve.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.689
The mandible is the only
movable bone of the skull.

10:30.793 --> 10:33.896
Onto the bones
of the arms and hands.

10:34.931 --> 10:37.620
<i>Choosing Head of the Class
was a terrible decision.</i>

10:37.724 --> 10:40.034
There was a lot to remember
in the eight-minute lecture.

10:40.137 --> 10:43.172
The humerus is
the longest bone in the arm.

10:43.275 --> 10:44.758
<i>- It took a long time.</i>
- The ulna...

10:44.862 --> 10:46.931
It was just,
it was overwhelming.

10:47.034 --> 10:51.172
...and forms the elbow joint
along with the humerus.

10:51.275 --> 10:52.965
- We made it. Thank God.
- Thank God.

10:55.241 --> 10:56.448
- Thank you.
- Sounds good.

10:56.551 --> 10:59.758
Moving away
from bones to organs.

11:01.931 --> 11:04.137
This is my first
experience with cutting

11:04.241 --> 11:06.068
an 88-pound of cheese in half.

11:10.620 --> 11:12.586
All right, so we're gonna
take it and put it here,

11:12.689 --> 11:13.896
and then we're gonna
carry it inside.

11:15.758 --> 11:17.724
<i>- Grazie.</i>
Let's get the receipt.
- Yeah.

11:17.827 --> 11:19.620
<i>Grazie.</i>
All right, set that down.

11:19.724 --> 11:20.620
Good.

11:20.724 --> 11:22.310
One, two, three.

11:22.413 --> 11:23.931
All right.
We're gonna go right here,

11:24.034 --> 11:25.896
and we're just gonna take it
down to Ugo, uh, Bassi again.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.482
- We're gonna cross the street.
- Ugo Bassi again?

11:27.586 --> 11:29.620
We're trying
to get here. Is it close?

11:29.724 --> 11:30.758
We're here.

11:33.068 --> 11:34.482
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

11:34.586 --> 11:35.896
- All right.
Come on, let's go.
- Okay.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.275
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Let's pick it up.

11:37.379 --> 11:40.344
We have to find
Teatro Anatomico. I don't know

11:40.448 --> 11:42.034
- if that's a difficult,
if that's difficult or not.
- Wait a minute.

11:42.137 --> 11:43.482
It says, "For both Detours,

11:43.586 --> 11:45.896
drive yourself to Piazza
Franklin Delano Roosevelt."

11:46.000 --> 11:48.172
- Oh, my God.
- In a car.

11:52.689 --> 11:54.172
<i>We have to find this place.</i>

11:54.275 --> 11:55.931
Teatro Anatomico.

11:56.034 --> 11:57.275
I don't know
if that's a difficult,

11:57.379 --> 11:58.241
- if that's difficult or not.
- Wait a minute.

11:58.344 --> 11:59.689
It says, "For both Detours,

11:59.793 --> 12:02.034
drive yourself to Piazza
Franklin Delano Roosevelt."

12:02.137 --> 12:03.379
In a car.

12:03.482 --> 12:04.655
- Let's go.
- Oh, my God.

12:04.758 --> 12:06.137
We were supposed
to drive ourselves?

12:06.241 --> 12:07.379
Hurry up.
Come on, come on, come on.

12:07.482 --> 12:09.241
Read the clue.

12:09.344 --> 12:11.931
<i>So the lesson is concluded.</i>

12:12.034 --> 12:14.000
- Thank you.
- Chaos.

12:14.103 --> 12:15.448
Absolute chaos.

12:15.551 --> 12:16.724
They got to take the exam.

12:16.827 --> 12:17.758
- Good luck.
- Good luck to you.

12:17.862 --> 12:20.000
All right.
Looks intense.

12:20.103 --> 12:21.896
- I don't want to talk too
much because it's in my head.
- Okay.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.724
<i>Scusi. Scusi. Scusi.</i>

12:26.137 --> 12:27.379
<i>Scusi.</i>

12:28.379 --> 12:31.344
Right now, we're looking
for Via de' Fusari.

12:31.448 --> 12:33.896
The second drop-off is gonna be
on this street over here.

12:36.172 --> 12:38.206
<i>- Buongiorno.
- Buongiorno.</i>

12:39.206 --> 12:40.172
- Give me a second.
- All right. On three.

12:40.275 --> 12:41.310
One, two, three.

12:45.448 --> 12:47.310
<i>- Grazie.</i>
- <i>Grazie.</i>
- Ciao.

12:47.413 --> 12:49.413
<i>"Return your cart to where
you picked it up. Then bring</i>

12:49.517 --> 12:50.586
your receipts to Formaggerie
to receive your clue."

12:50.689 --> 12:51.758
All right, this way.

12:51.862 --> 12:53.206
<i>Grazie.</i>

12:53.310 --> 12:54.931
- Do you know where we are?
- Via de' Preti.

12:55.034 --> 12:56.344
Santa Maria Maggiore.

12:56.448 --> 12:58.241
- We went a little bit past it.
- Okay.

12:58.344 --> 13:00.137
- Are you good?
- I got it. I got it.

13:00.241 --> 13:02.379
Diana. Ristorante Diana.

13:06.758 --> 13:09.586
How do you say "Yay"
in <i>Italiano?</i>

13:09.689 --> 13:11.310
No? Nothing?

13:11.413 --> 13:13.931
- Awesome. What?!
- Beautiful.

13:14.034 --> 13:15.241
Give half to the, to the chef.

13:15.344 --> 13:17.068
<i>Signor. Grazie.</i>

13:17.172 --> 13:19.448
- Thank you.
- He has to
give us a receipt.

13:19.551 --> 13:20.448
One down.

13:20.551 --> 13:21.620
<i>Grazie.</i>

13:21.724 --> 13:22.827
Let's go, let's go.

13:22.931 --> 13:24.896
All right, we're on Giacomo.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.482
Yeah, Ugo Bassi.

13:26.586 --> 13:28.068
- Yo, what's good, guys?
- You guys are doing the cheese?

13:28.172 --> 13:29.275
We're going there.
We got to take the cart back.

13:29.379 --> 13:30.379
Come on, come on.

13:31.482 --> 13:32.793
We'll make this left,

13:32.896 --> 13:34.310
and we should be back
where we started, okay?

13:34.413 --> 13:35.517
Oh, my goodness.

13:35.620 --> 13:36.724
We got to make up
this time we lost, babe.

13:36.827 --> 13:38.206
Yeah, we'll be fine.
We'll be fine.

13:38.310 --> 13:39.482
Why is it so hard to shift?

13:39.586 --> 13:40.793
It's okay, it's not.

13:40.896 --> 13:42.275
Don't complain about it,
because we don't want to

13:42.379 --> 13:43.551
- s-speak that into it.
- I'm not complaining about it.

13:43.655 --> 13:44.931
Just work with it.

13:45.034 --> 13:47.275
Because then you just,
you manifest it all

13:47.379 --> 13:49.000
to be difficult
when it doesn't need to be.

13:49.103 --> 13:51.241
It's all about your perspective.

13:51.344 --> 13:53.413
- I'm so stressed out,
I can't even think.
- It's okay.

13:53.517 --> 13:54.965
It's okay.

13:55.068 --> 13:57.931
Oh, God. This car.

13:58.034 --> 13:59.310
You got this.

13:59.413 --> 14:00.413
All right.

14:00.517 --> 14:02.172
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

14:02.275 --> 14:04.379
- Can you do this,
or should we switch?
- No, I can do this.

14:04.482 --> 14:05.586
We just need to get it
to the cart.

14:05.689 --> 14:07.137
- Just that way.
- Okay.

14:07.241 --> 14:08.344
- Are you sure
you can do this?
- Yes.

14:09.620 --> 14:10.517
Yes, sir.

14:10.620 --> 14:12.137
<i>- Grazie.</i>
- Rip it.

14:12.241 --> 14:13.724
"Route Info.

14:13.827 --> 14:16.137
<i>Drive to the Ducati Factory
to find your next clue."</i>

14:16.241 --> 14:18.103
Oh, hell yeah.
We're going to Ducati?

14:18.206 --> 14:19.482
<i>Start.</i>

14:28.137 --> 14:29.965
I think that's the leg.

14:37.896 --> 14:40.965
They did give us maybe 30 parts

14:41.068 --> 14:43.620
<i>to remember
in the eight-minute lecture.</i>

14:43.724 --> 14:44.931
And there are more words

14:45.034 --> 14:46.275
than there are
spaces to put the words.

14:46.379 --> 14:49.586
That's your funny bone, right?

14:49.689 --> 14:50.793
That was
pretty confusing for us.

14:53.689 --> 14:55.000
Time is over. Please.

14:55.103 --> 14:56.620
Hands up, and step aside.

14:56.724 --> 14:58.034
- Baby, come on.
- Okay.

14:58.137 --> 15:00.413
Let's go, Dad. It's fine.
Let's just do it again.

15:00.517 --> 15:01.620
Welcome
to the anatomical theater.

15:01.724 --> 15:02.724
Thank you.

15:05.068 --> 15:07.275
- Hi, guys.
- Welcome back.

15:07.379 --> 15:09.724
- Pretty tough?
- So hard.
- Tough.

15:09.827 --> 15:11.034
Anatomico.

15:11.137 --> 15:12.206
Yeah, we're in the right place.

15:12.310 --> 15:14.206
Class is about to begin.

15:14.310 --> 15:15.206
<i>Grazie.</i>

15:15.310 --> 15:18.448
Prepare for the lecture.

15:18.551 --> 15:20.896
We're delivering cheese
in Italy.

15:21.931 --> 15:23.344
- <i>Scusi.</i>
- Maybe over there?

15:23.448 --> 15:24.482
Chef outside?

15:24.586 --> 15:25.551
That's it. Chef!

15:25.655 --> 15:27.137
Yes, it's here.

15:28.517 --> 15:29.655
Now, where we got to go back to?

15:29.758 --> 15:31.448
Back to where we got the cart.

15:31.551 --> 15:33.310
- Bye, ciao! <i>Grazie!</i>
- Bye! Thank you!

15:35.034 --> 15:37.137
- I see Diana.
- Awesome. Whew.

15:37.241 --> 15:38.724
Come on.

15:38.827 --> 15:40.448
<i>The thing about this Detour
and all physical Detours</i>

15:40.551 --> 15:41.793
<i>are they're pretty straightforward.</i>

15:41.896 --> 15:43.413
- Do we know where we're going?
- Yeah.

15:43.517 --> 15:45.068
You know what you have to do,
you know where you have to go.

15:45.172 --> 15:47.379
Really, you just have to have
the endurance to complete it.

15:47.482 --> 15:49.689
So...
I think we have that.

15:49.793 --> 15:51.965
- Okay.
- I'm barely even sweating. Okay.

15:52.068 --> 15:53.172
<i>- Grazie.</i>
- <i>Grazie.</i>

15:53.275 --> 15:55.965
Away we go! Bologna.

15:56.068 --> 15:57.137
Yes.

15:57.241 --> 15:58.551
Yes.

15:58.655 --> 15:59.758
- Thank you.
- <i>Grazie.</i>

15:59.862 --> 16:00.931
<i>- Grazie. Grazie.
- Grazie.</i>

16:01.034 --> 16:02.517
Is this it?

16:04.862 --> 16:06.275
- Hotel Roma?
- Is it upstairs?

16:06.379 --> 16:07.827
What is the name
of the restaurant?

16:07.931 --> 16:10.344
Osteria del Cappello.

16:11.344 --> 16:12.448
Let me see.

16:12.551 --> 16:13.862
This might be it.

16:15.344 --> 16:17.620
I'm trying... I want
to keep an eye on our cheese.

16:17.724 --> 16:19.620
Osteria. What is this?

16:19.724 --> 16:21.275
- What number is it?
- 13.

16:21.379 --> 16:23.517
Okay. No, that isn't...
Can we just ask someone?

16:28.620 --> 16:30.551
You got to find that rhythm, babe.

16:31.620 --> 16:32.793
I'm releasing really slow, too.

16:32.896 --> 16:34.758
<i>Ay, ay, ay.</i>

16:34.862 --> 16:36.206
So stressful.

16:39.413 --> 16:41.689
- Do I need to straighten out?
- No.

16:41.793 --> 16:43.793
We might've ran down this street
instead of this street.

16:43.896 --> 16:45.068
Yep. We're on the wrong street.

16:45.172 --> 16:46.172
Okay, okay, okay.
We're on the wrong street.

16:46.275 --> 16:47.241
Here we go.

16:47.344 --> 16:48.379
We're all turned around.

16:48.482 --> 16:50.068
I'm making a U-turn.

16:50.172 --> 16:51.448
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

16:51.551 --> 16:53.000
<i>Scusi.</i> I'll run ahead, Derek.

16:53.103 --> 16:54.689
All right, clear the path.

16:56.448 --> 16:58.275
- <i>Scusi.</i>
- <i>Scusi.</i>

16:58.379 --> 16:59.724
Ah, <i>signor.</i>

16:59.827 --> 17:01.103
- Ciao, ciao.
- Ciao, ciao, ciao.

17:02.137 --> 17:03.586
- Okay.
- Fantastic.

17:03.689 --> 17:05.448
- Can we get the receipt?
- <i>Grazie.</i>

17:05.551 --> 17:07.137
- I know how to get back.
- Okay, let's turn back.

17:07.241 --> 17:09.551
- Okay, so there's
no other cars.
- Yeah.

17:09.655 --> 17:11.482
- So we're
probably last.
- Yeah.

17:11.586 --> 17:13.172
We got to make up some time.
We got to find that place now.

17:13.275 --> 17:15.034
- Yeah.
- Thank God we had a head start.

17:15.137 --> 17:18.793
Moving away from bones
to organs.

17:18.896 --> 17:22.172
The heart is located
in the thoracic cavity

17:22.275 --> 17:25.310
and circulates blood
through the body

17:25.413 --> 17:26.551
by its contraction.

17:26.655 --> 17:30.000
The liver holds
about one pint of blood.

17:30.965 --> 17:32.586
Ciao.

17:33.724 --> 17:34.827
Yes.

17:34.931 --> 17:36.172
Really happy customers.

17:36.275 --> 17:37.827
- Thank you. <i>
- Grazie.</i>

17:37.931 --> 17:39.551
Lesson is concluded.

17:40.793 --> 17:42.482
Hey, guys.

17:42.586 --> 17:43.862
They're going to the exam.

17:45.344 --> 17:46.241
Go.

17:52.206 --> 17:54.137
The deltoid is this one.

17:54.241 --> 17:57.275
- The fibula...
- Calcaneus is this one.

17:57.379 --> 17:58.965
Humerus.

17:59.068 --> 18:01.068
Metatarsals. Is that feet?

18:01.172 --> 18:02.310
Mm-hmm.

18:02.413 --> 18:04.137
This is the brachialis.
Biceps. Triceps.

18:07.310 --> 18:08.827
Is this the liver?

18:08.931 --> 18:10.448
Yeah. Do we have a liver?

18:10.551 --> 18:11.620
Yeah, I've got a liver.

18:13.103 --> 18:14.793
Wait, not the liver.
The liver's here.

18:17.827 --> 18:19.206
I think the stomach.

18:19.310 --> 18:20.655
Mandible. Check.

18:20.758 --> 18:22.655
- Clavicle. Check.
- Check.

18:22.758 --> 18:24.068
Stop.

18:24.172 --> 18:26.206
All of you, hands up,
and step aside, please.

18:26.310 --> 18:27.206
Thank you.

18:27.310 --> 18:29.034
Mm-hmm.

18:29.137 --> 18:30.965
We didn't finish.
We're missing two.

18:31.068 --> 18:33.034
I'm sorry.

18:33.137 --> 18:34.241
We're missing so many.

18:34.344 --> 18:36.103
We need to go
a little bit faster.

18:36.206 --> 18:37.931
I know. Yeah.

18:38.034 --> 18:39.620
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
- All good.

18:39.724 --> 18:42.137
- We just got confused
by the extras that were in here.
- Yeah.

18:43.827 --> 18:47.551
Normally our strategy is,
do the physical challenges,

18:47.655 --> 18:49.448
<i>but I took anatomy in college.</i>

18:49.551 --> 18:50.896
It was one
of my strongest classes.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.103
<i>So I felt confident about it.</i>

18:54.206 --> 18:55.758
Here's your clue.

18:55.862 --> 18:56.620
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

18:56.724 --> 18:58.275
<i>She beasted that.</i>

18:58.379 --> 18:59.655
Beasted that.

18:59.758 --> 19:01.586
It definitely sucks
to see them get theirs.

19:03.413 --> 19:05.000
- We're good.
- Yeah. We'll get it
this time.

19:05.103 --> 19:06.620
Babe, I need directions.

19:06.724 --> 19:08.620
Okay, okay.
We just turned into Via Irnerio.

19:08.724 --> 19:10.517
So, go straight. Go straight.

19:15.172 --> 19:16.172
Richard.

19:17.206 --> 19:19.034
I know we want
to stay in the race,

19:19.137 --> 19:21.137
and we're gonna
do our very best, and...

19:21.241 --> 19:22.689
I'm not getting the directions.

19:22.793 --> 19:24.896
I'm not understanding
where we are.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.034
I'm not understanding where
to go.

19:27.137 --> 19:29.862
All the streets
are changing constantly,

19:29.965 --> 19:32.103
and I just, I'm very confused.

19:37.827 --> 19:39.655
Do you know how to navigate
using a map?

19:39.758 --> 19:41.793
- I don't. I-I mean...
- Okay, so let's-let's go

19:41.896 --> 19:43.241
- stop and grab directions.
- Okay.

19:43.344 --> 19:44.379
- Okay, we got to...
- Okay, stop-stop right here.

19:44.482 --> 19:45.448
- Yeah.
- Okay.

19:45.551 --> 19:48.034
Excuse me. Excuse me.

19:48.137 --> 19:50.310
Piazza Franklin
Delano Roosevelt?

19:50.413 --> 19:51.931
- Yes. Ugo Bassi.
- Ugo Bassi.

19:52.034 --> 19:53.862
- Okay. We got it. Thank you.
- Okay. Okay. <i>Grazie.</i>

19:53.965 --> 19:55.068
<i>- Grazie. Grazie.</i>
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Good luck, guys. Goodbye.

19:55.172 --> 19:56.896
I can do this.

19:58.655 --> 20:00.379
That's a stomach for you.

20:04.172 --> 20:05.241
Clavicle.

20:05.344 --> 20:06.344
Ilium.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.413
- Femur?
- It's this one.

20:10.517 --> 20:11.827
Okay.

20:11.931 --> 20:13.206
<i>I worked in the medical field</i>

20:13.310 --> 20:16.896
for so many years,
and the muscles, the bones,

20:17.000 --> 20:19.034
the organs, they're
not foreign to me at all.

20:19.137 --> 20:22.413
<i>- So we felt good that we had
a chance to really catch up.
- Yeah.</i>

20:23.827 --> 20:24.896
That's the heart.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.241
No, the middle muscle.

20:26.344 --> 20:27.448
Oh, that's the brachialis.

20:27.551 --> 20:29.068
- That's right.
- Oh, ilium.

20:29.172 --> 20:32.137
And I think this is the tibia.
Do you know what the kneecap is?

20:32.241 --> 20:33.413
Is it patella?

20:33.517 --> 20:34.758
Is it the patella?
Do you think so?

20:34.862 --> 20:35.965
This one right here
is the stomach.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.344
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

20:37.448 --> 20:38.275
I think that's right.

20:38.379 --> 20:39.448
Stop.

20:39.551 --> 20:40.827
Okay.

20:40.931 --> 20:42.103
I feel good about it.

20:43.241 --> 20:44.827
- Sorry.
- It's not right?

20:44.931 --> 20:45.965
- Sorry.
- Okay.

20:46.068 --> 20:47.068
Okay.

20:53.034 --> 20:55.275
- Here you go.
- Yes.

20:55.379 --> 20:56.448
"Your next clue."

20:56.551 --> 20:57.655
-"Ducati Factory." Okay.
- Oh, my God.

20:57.758 --> 20:59.517
- Congratulations. Yes.
- Thank you.

20:59.620 --> 21:01.068
No.

21:02.103 --> 21:03.620
What? Oh, my God. <i></i>

21:04.655 --> 21:06.482
That's all right.
Let's just do it again.

21:07.758 --> 21:09.793
<i>- This looks like
it's it right here.
- Yep.</i>

21:09.896 --> 21:11.724
It's right here, Marcus.
This is all the parking.

21:11.827 --> 21:12.827
Let's do it.

21:12.931 --> 21:14.379
You see a clue box?

21:14.482 --> 21:16.413
I don't see one yet,
but I see that-that flag.

21:16.517 --> 21:18.310
- There it is.
- There it is,
right there.

21:18.413 --> 21:21.241
"Roadblock.
Who's Ready for a Brake?"

21:21.344 --> 21:24.413
<i>Speed is a way of life
here in the Motor Valley.</i>

21:24.517 --> 21:25.655
<i>The Bolognese territory</i>

21:25.758 --> 21:27.931
is home to a number

21:28.034 --> 21:30.965
<i>of world-famous
manufacturers, including...</i>

21:32.379 --> 21:36.586
...Ducati and the flagship
model, the Panigale V4--

21:36.689 --> 21:39.448
<i>the fastest
SuperSport bike they make.</i>

21:39.551 --> 21:42.310
<i>Teams must first
assemble the wheels and brakes,</i>

21:42.413 --> 21:45.103
<i>then have their work
approved by the mechanic</i>

21:45.206 --> 21:47.413
<i>before installing
the body panels.</i>

21:47.517 --> 21:51.310
When the lead mechanic
says that it's "race-ready,"

21:51.413 --> 21:52.862
<i>they'll get a clue.</i>

21:52.965 --> 21:53.827
- I'll do it.
- All right. Michael's
gonna do it.

21:53.931 --> 21:55.068
<i>Oh, right here.</i>

22:01.862 --> 22:02.827
<i>I love this.</i>

22:02.931 --> 22:04.379
<i>It's all you?</i>

22:04.482 --> 22:06.275
<i>I have to
put together the wheels,</i>

22:06.379 --> 22:09.034
<i>brakes and body panels.</i>

22:09.137 --> 22:11.344
<i>Michael and I
are both into motorcycles,</i>

22:11.448 --> 22:12.896
<i>and I actually have that bike.</i>

22:13.000 --> 22:16.793
I own a Ducati Panigale V4.

22:16.896 --> 22:18.586
<i>I don't tinker.</i>

22:18.689 --> 22:21.931
<i>It sounds snobbish,
but it's like, either you know</i>

22:22.034 --> 22:24.620
how to do something
or you pay somebody to do it.

22:24.724 --> 22:26.965
I'm the type of person
that I'm trying to pay

22:27.068 --> 22:29.034
- somebody to do it.
- And I'll try.

22:29.137 --> 22:32.862
<i>So I'm going to watch
this ongoing demonstration.</i>

22:32.965 --> 22:35.931
But not having directions,
like, going to watch

22:36.034 --> 22:38.344
<i>the lead mechanic
put it together, take it apart,</i>

22:38.448 --> 22:41.172
I was like, "Ugh.
This is gonna be very tedious."

22:41.275 --> 22:43.241
Work it out, Mike.
We're the first team here.

22:43.344 --> 22:44.482
Let's get this thing done.

22:45.758 --> 22:47.758
Hold on. This is
a <i>biblioteca.</i> There you go.

22:47.862 --> 22:49.103
- Great.
- Excuse us.

22:49.206 --> 22:50.551
- We got this, babe. We got this.
- I got you.

22:50.655 --> 22:51.620
I'm not worried at all.

22:51.724 --> 22:52.827
- Ah.
- Is this it?

22:52.931 --> 22:54.275
<i>- Biblioteca?</i>
- No.

22:55.275 --> 22:58.655
<i>When we got into the theater,
just seeing two additional teams</i>

22:58.758 --> 23:01.172
- that were there brought
a little bit of a relief.
- Yeah.

23:01.275 --> 23:02.620
Especially this
being a Mega Leg,

23:02.724 --> 23:05.000
<i>because with two Roadblocks,</i>

23:05.103 --> 23:07.103
<i>two Detours, you never know.</i>

23:07.206 --> 23:08.172
<i>It's anybody's game.</i>

23:08.275 --> 23:09.206
Go.

23:09.310 --> 23:10.931
Here.

23:19.862 --> 23:21.551
Dad, please do your side first.

23:21.655 --> 23:23.689
Understand? Thank you.

23:24.689 --> 23:25.965
Yes. This one.

23:27.034 --> 23:28.310
Ilium is, yeah.

23:28.413 --> 23:30.068
And then tibia is... okay. <i></i>

23:30.172 --> 23:31.172
Stop.

23:32.586 --> 23:34.000
- Okay, this is right.
- Yeah.

23:35.206 --> 23:36.620
This has to be right.

23:36.724 --> 23:38.275
I'm so nervous.
I really hope we get it.

23:38.379 --> 23:40.000
Yeah!

23:40.103 --> 23:41.275
Let's go.

23:42.275 --> 23:44.206
"Drive to Ducati Factory
to find your next clue."

23:44.310 --> 23:46.275
- All right, back to the car.
- Ducati Factory.

23:46.379 --> 23:47.379
- A14?
- Yeah.

23:47.482 --> 23:48.827
We're going the wrong way, babe.

23:48.931 --> 23:50.068
Damn.

23:50.172 --> 23:51.862
We got to get off
and get back on again.

23:53.344 --> 23:54.793
- All right, we're back.
We're back, we're back.
- Yeah, this looks good.

23:54.896 --> 23:55.862
We're good.

23:55.965 --> 23:56.793
Work it out, Mike.

23:56.896 --> 23:58.724
Work it out. Work it out.

23:58.827 --> 23:59.862
<i>There.</i>

23:59.965 --> 24:01.068
<i>Clue box.</i>

24:01.172 --> 24:02.551
- I can do it.
- Are you sure?

24:02.655 --> 24:04.137
Yeah.

24:04.241 --> 24:05.448
There's only one team here.
Yes! Marcus!

24:07.689 --> 24:08.620
My brother.

24:08.724 --> 24:10.551
Ah!

24:10.655 --> 24:13.517
If you see Marcus,
you can't be in last.

24:14.862 --> 24:17.275
I think I'm just gonna
gather my stuff.

24:17.379 --> 24:18.793
You got this, Claire.

24:18.896 --> 24:21.620
So they're straight-up
just assembling this car?

24:21.724 --> 24:23.206
This motorcycle?

24:23.310 --> 24:24.793
I literally just called it
a car.

24:25.793 --> 24:27.103
Come on.

24:27.206 --> 24:28.344
Come on, come on, come on.
Let's get it done.

24:28.448 --> 24:29.586
There we go.

24:29.689 --> 24:31.413
I'm trying to see
a full demonstration

24:31.517 --> 24:33.344
of how to put on the wheels.
I'm taking notes,

24:33.448 --> 24:36.172
<i>um, because I let down
Derek at yodeling,</i>

24:36.275 --> 24:37.241
<i>so don't want to repeat.</i>

24:37.344 --> 24:38.413
Let's go!

24:38.517 --> 24:39.379
"Who's Ready for a Brake?"

24:39.482 --> 24:40.413
Me.

24:40.517 --> 24:41.689
I'll do it. Hold this.

24:41.793 --> 24:43.551
It's getting there.

24:43.655 --> 24:45.482
I think I got
the rear wheel on right.

24:45.586 --> 24:48.586
Just putting in the front tire.

24:48.689 --> 24:50.000
"If the lead mechanic approves,

24:50.103 --> 24:52.034
you may proceed to
installing the body panels."

24:52.137 --> 24:53.689
Looking good, Michael.
Looking good.

24:53.793 --> 24:55.275
Baby, you got this!

24:58.862 --> 25:00.103
Come on, Q!

25:00.206 --> 25:02.172
Put this on.

25:02.275 --> 25:03.413
Go, Claire.

25:03.517 --> 25:05.586
Team Claire.
Claire, Claire, Claire.

25:05.689 --> 25:06.965
This little doodad.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.586
Just try and watch closely
in detail.

25:09.689 --> 25:10.793
This is a big old puzzle.

25:10.896 --> 25:12.275
Okay, Quinton, focus.

25:12.379 --> 25:14.000
I saw the mechanic
put it in neutral...

25:15.034 --> 25:16.620
...to spin the wheel.

25:17.620 --> 25:20.172
And then I will get a check.

25:21.379 --> 25:22.965
Here we go.

25:23.068 --> 25:24.310
Sir?

25:29.931 --> 25:31.034
Yes.

25:32.137 --> 25:34.068
So I can move on
to installing the body panels.

25:35.068 --> 25:37.517
Give this bad boy
maybe a couple cranks.

25:39.172 --> 25:41.034
That doesn't feel right.

25:42.379 --> 25:45.068
I'm not really fully sure
how to use this little wrench.

25:45.172 --> 25:46.310
Baby, you got this!

25:47.655 --> 25:48.551
Focus!

25:48.655 --> 25:49.758
What's it stuck on?

25:49.862 --> 25:51.482
I don't know
what the hell I'm doing.

25:52.482 --> 25:54.965
<i>Excuse me. Do you know
where the Teatro Anatomico is?</i>

25:55.068 --> 25:58.448
Uh, on the right.
Uh, that's the door.

25:58.551 --> 26:00.172
- Uh-huh.
- Archiginnasio.

26:00.275 --> 26:01.344
<i>Grazie. Grazie.</i> Thank you.

26:01.448 --> 26:03.310
Right here. Right here.
Come on.

26:03.413 --> 26:05.448
Thank you.

26:05.551 --> 26:07.241
Good job. Good job.

26:07.344 --> 26:10.689
I was definitely surprised
to see Lumumba and Glenda,

26:10.793 --> 26:12.379
<i>because they were
in the first group,</i>

26:12.482 --> 26:15.344
and we left in the third group,
but we were there together.

26:17.517 --> 26:18.896
Ilium, fibula.

26:19.000 --> 26:19.931
- What? What?
- I don't know where those go.

26:20.034 --> 26:21.862
Fibula, fibula.

26:21.965 --> 26:23.241
- Intestine. Intestine.
- Femur.

26:23.344 --> 26:25.379
Cecum, cecum, cecum,
cecum, cecum, cecum.

26:25.482 --> 26:27.172
Femur is down that way.

26:27.275 --> 26:29.379
- What is metatarsals?
What are these?
- I don't know.

26:29.482 --> 26:31.137
Stop, please. Thank you.

26:31.241 --> 26:32.344
Gosh.

26:34.482 --> 26:35.758
Oh, ...

26:35.862 --> 26:37.793
Third gear again.

26:37.896 --> 26:39.724
I'm so frazzled right now,
I can't even tell you.

26:39.827 --> 26:42.931
- I'm, like, I'm near the tears.
And here they come.
- No, you got this.

26:43.034 --> 26:45.448
She was getting
super frustrated in the car,

26:45.551 --> 26:48.965
<i>and I still maybe don't know
how to really be a sister.</i>

26:49.068 --> 26:50.137
You got this, Em.

26:50.241 --> 26:51.655
<i>So I just kind of let her</i>

26:51.758 --> 26:53.137
<i>get her frustrations out.</i>

26:53.241 --> 26:54.482
I believe in you.

26:54.586 --> 26:56.206
<i>There it is.</i>

26:56.310 --> 26:57.896
Okay, I'll do it.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.379
Michael, wrap it up, B.

26:59.482 --> 27:01.137
We got other challenges to do.

27:01.241 --> 27:02.448
Let's get out of here.

27:04.344 --> 27:06.344
This doesn't really seem
like it's right.

27:07.379 --> 27:08.758
I used to have
a moped growing up.

27:08.862 --> 27:10.241
My neighbor pushed me off of it,

27:10.344 --> 27:12.310
because he was mad he didn't
get one for Christmas.

27:12.413 --> 27:13.517
Shade.

27:13.620 --> 27:15.034
Let's see.

27:15.137 --> 27:17.689
Oh, that's loosening it.

27:17.793 --> 27:19.931
I wish I knew
how this thing worked.

27:20.034 --> 27:22.000
Am I doing it wrong? Probably.

27:29.517 --> 27:31.620
Righty tighty, lefty loosey.

27:31.724 --> 27:33.137
- We got it.
- All right.

27:33.241 --> 27:34.482
- You're gonna do great.
- Looks like fun.

27:34.586 --> 27:35.724
He's meticulous.

27:37.793 --> 27:40.103
It's just not lining up.

27:41.103 --> 27:42.551
There we go.

27:42.655 --> 27:45.103
<i>It being a motorcycle,
Michael's mechanically inclined.</i>

27:45.206 --> 27:48.034
I thought it shouldn't be too,
uh, difficult of a task.

27:48.137 --> 27:50.379
Give it the once-over.
It's all detail now.

27:51.758 --> 27:53.413
See, it's coming loose.

27:53.517 --> 27:55.448
Oh, this is so hard.

27:55.551 --> 27:56.793
You got this, Q!

27:56.896 --> 27:58.482
I don't understand.

27:58.586 --> 28:00.103
The back tire won't rotate.

28:00.206 --> 28:01.758
What's happening?

28:01.862 --> 28:05.241
The back wheel has to spin
freely, but it's not spinning.

28:05.344 --> 28:07.586
All three samples
have spinning wheels.

28:07.689 --> 28:09.310
I don't know how to...

28:09.413 --> 28:10.448
I'm pretty handy
around the house,

28:10.551 --> 28:12.172
<i>but I don't ride bikes.</i>

28:12.275 --> 28:13.310
And I'm not here
to mess with a Ducati.

28:13.413 --> 28:14.620
Yeah.

28:14.724 --> 28:16.275
Turns out, you have
to, uh, press the clutch

28:16.379 --> 28:18.413
<i>to put it in neutral,
to make it spin.</i>

28:18.517 --> 28:19.827
Baby, focus! You got this!

28:19.931 --> 28:21.241
I'm good. I'm good.

28:21.344 --> 28:22.551
Oh, my gosh.
Three teams just ran in.

28:22.655 --> 28:24.620
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

28:24.724 --> 28:25.896
All right, let's do it.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.310
<i>Did you get it to spin?</i>

28:27.413 --> 28:28.689
- Did you get
the back tire spinning?
- No.

28:28.793 --> 28:30.068
<i>There weren't that many parts,</i>

28:30.172 --> 28:31.793
but they kind of
went together in specific ways,

28:31.896 --> 28:34.931
<i>and everybody seemed to be
having a difficult time.</i>

28:35.034 --> 28:36.448
I got to get something done.

28:36.551 --> 28:37.931
I would go look at the tutorial,

28:38.034 --> 28:39.482
<i>and then I would
go look at the finished piece.</i>

28:39.586 --> 28:41.275
<i>Then I would come back,
and by the time I came back,</i>

28:41.379 --> 28:42.827
I was like,
"What did I just go look at?"

28:42.931 --> 28:44.965
- I have done almost nothing, so...
- Okay.

28:45.068 --> 28:46.862
- Oh, they're all coming.
- Emily!

28:48.310 --> 28:49.724
<i>A lot of other teams are here,</i>

28:49.827 --> 28:51.862
but we're still, like,
in the lead.

28:51.965 --> 28:53.344
So...

28:53.448 --> 28:54.931
Okay, eight of the ten teams
are here.

28:55.034 --> 28:56.827
So, who's not here?

28:56.931 --> 28:58.551
Humerus.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.413
- Mandible.
- Cecum.

29:01.517 --> 29:03.655
Coccyx. Deltoid.

29:03.758 --> 29:05.344
- Do you know tibia?
- So, what? Ilium.

29:05.448 --> 29:07.241
- That's the, that's the, uh...
- No, no, the ilium...

29:07.344 --> 29:09.206
The u-u-ulna.

29:09.310 --> 29:10.931
Is it more than what it is?

29:11.034 --> 29:12.965
Stop. Stop.

29:13.068 --> 29:14.689
We may not use every piece.

29:14.793 --> 29:16.344
Sorry, you have to go
to your lesson again.

29:16.448 --> 29:17.413
Okay. <i></i>

29:17.517 --> 29:19.413
We bombed...

29:19.517 --> 29:21.344
Ooh.

29:21.448 --> 29:23.068
...at Head of the Class.

29:23.172 --> 29:25.206
We were not the head.

29:25.310 --> 29:26.689
- What's this bone?
- Stop.

29:26.793 --> 29:28.310
- We got to stop.
- Dang it.

29:28.413 --> 29:30.862
I mean, we were like, "What did
we get ourselves into?"

29:30.965 --> 29:32.379
"And how do we
get out of this thing?"

29:32.482 --> 29:35.275
-"Emir." He kept saying "emir."
- That's not on there.

29:35.379 --> 29:37.000
You know, so we sat
in front of that professor.

29:37.103 --> 29:40.034
Mind you,
his native language is Italian.

29:40.137 --> 29:41.793
- Yeah.
- And so we had
some issues with even

29:41.896 --> 29:43.000
- understanding
the words that he was using.
- Yeah.

29:43.103 --> 29:44.448
Humerus.

29:44.551 --> 29:45.689
Where's the "emir"?

29:45.793 --> 29:47.000
Humerus.

29:47.103 --> 29:48.827
He kept saying "emir."

29:48.931 --> 29:53.310
Humerus. The humerus
is the longest bone in the arm.

29:53.413 --> 29:54.724
It was the humerus.

29:54.827 --> 29:56.482
It started with a "E,"
but it's not...

29:56.586 --> 29:57.517
Stop.

29:57.620 --> 29:58.655
He just said "emir."

29:58.758 --> 30:00.413
Okay. Repeat. Go.

30:00.517 --> 30:02.241
- Brachialis.
- Tibia or fibula.

30:02.344 --> 30:03.586
This is the heart?

30:03.689 --> 30:06.103
Um, we're gonna roll with it.

30:06.206 --> 30:07.793
Okay, let's make it neat
in case we got it right.

30:07.896 --> 30:09.724
- And stop.
- Damn. It may be that one.

30:09.827 --> 30:11.206
That's it. It's that one.

30:20.620 --> 30:22.896
- Please...
- Oh, God, thank you.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.827
...give this
to the other couple. Thank you.

30:25.931 --> 30:27.827
Oh, thank you, Jesus.

30:27.931 --> 30:28.827
- And that's yours.
- Okay.

30:31.034 --> 30:32.344
- Good job, you guys.
- Good job.

30:32.448 --> 30:35.137
I felt great, but I knew
that we were so far behind.

30:35.241 --> 30:37.241
"The Ducati Factory
to find your next clue." Okay.

30:37.344 --> 30:38.931
- All right, let's go.
- Okay.

30:42.310 --> 30:43.758
Mike, try to knock it out.

30:43.862 --> 30:46.793
So this is the last thing,
and then I will get a check.

30:48.103 --> 30:49.931
I know you got this, Claire.

30:50.965 --> 30:53.827
- Come on.
- There's just something
obvious that I'm missing.

30:53.931 --> 30:55.206
You got this, Q!

30:55.310 --> 30:57.655
Is there a brake on?
Am I being dumb?

30:57.758 --> 30:59.517
This isn't rocket science.

30:59.620 --> 31:01.103
It's motorcycle science.

31:01.206 --> 31:02.275
Sir, wheel check.

31:02.379 --> 31:04.379
You got this, babe!

31:07.344 --> 31:09.275
Yes, baby!

31:09.379 --> 31:12.241
<i>My back wheel doesn't spin,
and I cannot for the life of me</i>

31:12.344 --> 31:14.827
figure out how to make it spin.

31:14.931 --> 31:16.275
You can't tell me.

31:16.379 --> 31:18.103
I do mechanical work
for a living.

31:18.206 --> 31:21.827
I grew up on <i>Fast & Furious,</i>
so it's a bit easier for me

31:21.931 --> 31:23.689
to figure out certain things.

31:23.793 --> 31:25.655
So, David
is a helicopter mechanic,

31:25.758 --> 31:28.413
and, in his free time,
he's building a car.

31:28.517 --> 31:32.413
He's working on my car, so
this is completely up his alley.

31:32.517 --> 31:34.896
<i>I think we have a really
good chance of passing people.</i>

31:35.000 --> 31:37.103
Where's my Snap-on ratchets, baby?

31:37.206 --> 31:40.103
Need to make
all my friends back home proud.

31:40.206 --> 31:42.344
Played around with cars
but not bikes.

31:42.448 --> 31:44.586
You got it, Pa. It's all you.

31:44.689 --> 31:46.655
I love you, Em. You got this.

31:46.758 --> 31:49.551
<i>I got in there, I saw the demo,</i>

31:49.655 --> 31:51.689
<i>and I knew exactly
what I had to do.</i>

31:51.793 --> 31:53.482
I have a pretty strong
attention to detail.

31:53.586 --> 31:56.206
<i>Really hyper-focused.
I do build things.</i>

31:56.310 --> 31:57.655
<i>I'm a single mom,</i>

31:57.758 --> 31:59.862
so all the toys that we bought,
I was building.

31:59.965 --> 32:01.793
I build Legos
with her all the time,

32:01.896 --> 32:03.344
<i>the IKEA furniture in the house.</i>

32:03.448 --> 32:07.206
So it was definitely
a good fit for me.

32:07.310 --> 32:08.896
It sounded like those
other guys couldn't figure out

32:09.000 --> 32:12.137
how to get their wheel to spin,
but I did it.

32:13.344 --> 32:15.655
So I'm one ahead of them.

32:15.758 --> 32:17.000
Sweet.

32:18.310 --> 32:19.206
Sir?

32:19.310 --> 32:21.344
Can I get a check?

32:22.344 --> 32:24.034
No.

32:24.137 --> 32:26.379
- No.
- No? Crap.

32:27.413 --> 32:28.793
<i>I got everything in.</i>

32:28.896 --> 32:30.689
It's just not fully aligned.

32:30.793 --> 32:32.689
And it's just frustrating.

32:34.275 --> 32:37.103
- You got this, Claire.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

32:37.206 --> 32:39.275
Can I get a check
on my wheels and brakes?

32:40.310 --> 32:42.379
- Too loose?
- You got this.

32:42.482 --> 32:45.103
- No.
- No. Okay. Too loose.

32:45.206 --> 32:46.448
Needs to be a little tighter.

32:46.551 --> 32:47.827
Come on.

32:47.931 --> 32:51.758
I'm not sure really
how to make them tighter.

32:51.862 --> 32:53.862
I can't even watch anymore.

32:53.965 --> 32:55.655
I'm doing something wrong.

32:55.758 --> 32:57.758
It doesn't feel good
that it's clicking.

32:57.862 --> 32:59.068
This is so brutal.

32:59.172 --> 33:00.793
Should be going the other way.

33:01.862 --> 33:03.620
Can you, like,
reverse the way this goes?

33:03.724 --> 33:05.655
I'm going the wrong way.

33:05.758 --> 33:07.689
CLAIRE [groans]:
I don't know what to do.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.862
Come on, Claire.

33:14.965 --> 33:16.448
I'm trying to figure
out how this tool works.

33:16.551 --> 33:18.310
I don't know.

33:18.413 --> 33:19.965
You got this.

33:20.068 --> 33:21.413
Come on. You got this.

33:21.517 --> 33:23.310
Oh, my God.

33:23.413 --> 33:25.275
I have been loosening these
instead of tightening them.

33:26.413 --> 33:27.896
Okay. Thank God.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
I would have been there all day.

33:30.103 --> 33:31.344
Oh, who knew?

33:31.448 --> 33:32.827
<i>I feel like,
with these Roadblocks,</i>

33:32.931 --> 33:35.620
<i>I always have
one thing that's trouble.</i>

33:35.724 --> 33:37.172
It's tightening now.

33:37.275 --> 33:38.344
It was like yodeling
all over again.

33:40.241 --> 33:41.137
That's it. Nice and tight.

33:41.241 --> 33:42.275
Can I get a wheel check?

33:42.379 --> 33:43.310
Oh.

33:43.413 --> 33:44.586
Okay.

33:44.689 --> 33:46.172
- Awesome. Thank you.
- Good job.

33:46.275 --> 33:47.793
Move on to the next one.
You got this, Claire.

33:47.896 --> 33:50.758
It's okay, Q. Figure it out.

33:50.862 --> 33:53.068
Ah, got it. Okay. It's spinning.

33:53.172 --> 33:54.758
Can I get a wheel check?

33:54.862 --> 33:55.862
You got it spinning?

33:55.965 --> 33:57.137
What the heck?

33:57.241 --> 33:58.137
Come on. Quick, quick, quick.

33:58.241 --> 33:59.448
Good.

33:59.551 --> 34:00.896
Yes! Let's go.
Let's go. Come on.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.689
That was it.
That was so frustrating.

34:02.793 --> 34:04.586
- Check.
- Good.

34:04.689 --> 34:06.896
- Yes. Thank you.
- Yes.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.965
Ooh. Nice little click.

34:10.068 --> 34:11.482
- Let's go, David.
- Dream challenge.

34:11.586 --> 34:13.482
Let's go, baby!

34:13.586 --> 34:15.551
Wheels, nuts,
ret-retaining nuts.

34:15.655 --> 34:17.068
To hold on to the wheel.

34:18.068 --> 34:20.620
And then going from there,
I'm, like, 90% done.

34:20.724 --> 34:22.310
You got it, babe.

34:22.413 --> 34:23.896
You're killing it, Pa.

34:24.000 --> 34:27.862
There's a hole right here
that this is supposed to be in.

34:27.965 --> 34:29.586
That's it, that's it, that's it.

34:29.689 --> 34:30.862
That's the brake.

34:30.965 --> 34:33.344
I want to do this one time correctly.

34:33.448 --> 34:35.689
There it is. Okay.

34:35.793 --> 34:38.448
<i>During the Roadblock,
I was kind of concerned</i>

34:38.551 --> 34:40.379
<i>because I felt like
everyone else was struggling,</i>

34:40.482 --> 34:42.551
<i>and I thought
it was kind of easy,</i>

34:42.655 --> 34:44.551
so I felt like
maybe I did something wrong.

34:44.655 --> 34:46.310
All right.

34:46.413 --> 34:47.517
Check.

34:47.620 --> 34:49.137
Look at your sister.

34:49.241 --> 34:50.965
I'm really glad
she's doing this now.

34:53.517 --> 34:55.551
All right. I got it, Mol.

34:55.655 --> 34:57.413
What? Oh, my God.

34:57.517 --> 35:00.344
Yes. Confidence.

35:00.448 --> 35:04.137
Got one final screw,
and then I'm gonna get a check.

35:05.413 --> 35:07.103
And hopefully
we'll be out of here.

35:07.206 --> 35:09.172
That took way too long.

35:10.206 --> 35:12.241
Kind of disappointed in myself. Check.

35:12.344 --> 35:14.310
Give him the clue.

35:14.413 --> 35:16.034
Give him a clue.

35:16.137 --> 35:18.034
Dope.

35:18.137 --> 35:20.206
That was very time-consuming
and tedious.

35:20.310 --> 35:21.689
<i>Grazie.</i>

35:21.793 --> 35:23.965
I didn't do a good job,
but we're done. Moving on.

35:24.068 --> 35:25.517
"The Mega Leg continues.

35:25.620 --> 35:28.793
<i>"Drive to the city of
Florence and find Villa Bardini</i>

35:28.896 --> 35:29.931
<i>for your next Roadblock clue."</i>

35:30.034 --> 35:31.413
All right, let's go get it.

35:32.448 --> 35:34.931
<i>It's kind of crazy
not to see the newlyweds.</i>

35:35.034 --> 35:37.482
- Anything can happen.
- There's still two teams
that aren't here.

35:37.586 --> 35:39.620
We don't know where anyone is.

35:39.724 --> 35:41.103
We don't know
what their struggles are.

35:41.206 --> 35:43.551
- This is a Mega Leg, too, so...
- Mm-hmm.

35:43.655 --> 35:45.137
...let's not exhale yet.

35:47.000 --> 35:48.517
We left with Rich and Dom.

35:48.620 --> 35:50.034
I-I feel like we're kind
of neck and neck

35:50.137 --> 35:52.551
trying to get to the, uh,
Ducati Factory.

35:52.655 --> 35:54.275
So we're
coming in from the back,

35:54.379 --> 35:55.896
even though we started in front.

35:56.931 --> 35:59.000
You got it, David. Yes, baby.

35:59.103 --> 36:00.068
You got it, Pa.

36:00.172 --> 36:01.413
You got the wheels done?

36:01.517 --> 36:03.482
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God. You did that fast.

36:03.586 --> 36:05.793
<i>Putting the body together,
there were a lot of details</i>

36:05.896 --> 36:07.931
<i>in the order of the steps
that he was going in.</i>

36:08.034 --> 36:10.241
Which side did he put on first?

36:10.344 --> 36:12.724
<i>One side had to go on
before the other side.</i>

36:12.827 --> 36:14.620
<i>So they meet together
kind of like a puzzle.</i>

36:14.724 --> 36:16.034
There you go.

36:16.137 --> 36:17.758
And that's probably
where people struggled.

36:19.172 --> 36:21.551
- What the hell?
- Stupid screw. Oh, my gosh.

36:21.655 --> 36:23.206
- Feel good?
- Almost there.

36:23.310 --> 36:25.689
I don't know how many teams
have gotten out of here so far.

36:25.793 --> 36:27.241
- Only one.
- Only one?

36:27.344 --> 36:28.965
Two teams aren't here still.

36:29.068 --> 36:30.482
"Who's Ready for a Brake?"

36:30.586 --> 36:32.689
Lumumba. Let's go.

36:32.793 --> 36:34.655
- He wanted a break from me.
- I...

36:36.379 --> 36:37.655
There's team orange.

36:37.758 --> 36:40.275
He said that really fast.
"Me. I want a break."

36:40.379 --> 36:41.931
You got this, baby.

36:42.034 --> 36:43.482
Come on.
This way, baby.

36:43.586 --> 36:44.965
-"Who's Ready for a Brake?"
- You.

36:45.068 --> 36:46.137
<i>- That's me.</i>
- All right.

36:46.241 --> 36:48.241
- Can I get a check?
- What?

36:48.344 --> 36:50.862
<i>I think a number one reason
we're here</i>

36:50.965 --> 36:53.551
<i>is to get to know
one another a little bit more</i>

36:53.655 --> 36:56.206
<i>and catch up on
the 36 years that we lost.</i>

36:56.310 --> 36:57.517
Okay.

36:57.620 --> 36:58.862
- Okay?
- Okay.

36:58.965 --> 37:00.517
Yes!

37:00.620 --> 37:03.103
And I was blown away.

37:03.206 --> 37:05.241
Oh, my God!

37:05.344 --> 37:07.482
I had no idea that
she'd be able to do that.

37:08.620 --> 37:10.862
<i>We're still learning
our weaknesses and strengths,</i>

37:10.965 --> 37:12.965
and you... wow.

37:17.068 --> 37:18.068
Oh, my...

37:18.172 --> 37:19.655
Okay, okay.

37:19.758 --> 37:21.379
- We made it.
- Confidence boost.

37:21.482 --> 37:23.172
- Lord Jesus.
- Florence. Okay.

37:23.275 --> 37:24.896
- Good job, girls.
- Thank you.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.551
You killed that. I can't believe
you came in second place.

37:27.655 --> 37:29.655
<i>Finally we got
to the Roadblock,</i>

37:29.758 --> 37:33.206
<i>and I was shocked that we ran
into so many other teams.</i>

37:34.551 --> 37:36.103
You got it, Pa.

37:36.206 --> 37:38.655
David, you got this, babe.
Just <i>tranquilo.</i>

37:38.758 --> 37:40.241
You got this, Claire. <i>
Tranquilo.</i>

37:40.344 --> 37:41.586
It's not flush.

37:41.689 --> 37:44.137
I don't really know
what to do about this.

37:44.241 --> 37:48.655
It was clear to us that it was
not an easy task for everyone.

37:48.758 --> 37:50.448
I just don't want to be last.

37:50.551 --> 37:52.137
So, feels good
to have people with us.

37:52.241 --> 37:54.172
So I'm hoping to get it soon,

37:54.275 --> 37:55.931
but this is
driving me a little crazy.

37:56.034 --> 37:57.206
I'm gonna get this done.

37:57.310 --> 37:58.862
- I can figure this out.
- Come on, Richie.

37:58.965 --> 38:01.241
<i>I do not work on my car at home.</i>

38:01.344 --> 38:03.275
<i>I know nothing
about motorcycles,</i>

38:03.379 --> 38:05.103
but I know
how to follow directions.

38:05.206 --> 38:08.413
We made it in here,
so I'm just happy to see people.

38:08.517 --> 38:10.793
<i>We didn't know how far
teams were ahead</i>

38:10.896 --> 38:13.551
<i>or how far we were apart,
but as soon as we got started,</i>

38:13.655 --> 38:14.724
<i>one by one,
they started to leave.</i>

38:14.827 --> 38:15.965
Okay.

38:16.068 --> 38:18.896
- Yes! Let's go, babe!
- Let's go!

38:19.000 --> 38:20.551
- Let's go.
- Let's go, David!

38:20.655 --> 38:21.551
You know, people were finishing.

38:21.655 --> 38:22.586
Good job.

38:22.689 --> 38:24.275
Thank you.

38:24.379 --> 38:25.965
And finishing
and finishing and finishing.

38:26.068 --> 38:27.724
- All right.
- Oh, thank God.

38:27.827 --> 38:29.172
Thank you.

38:29.275 --> 38:31.241
<i>And we just
had to focus on our game</i>

38:31.344 --> 38:33.068
and watch them as they left.

38:33.172 --> 38:35.000
- You good, Dad? You killed it.
- Yeah. Thank you.

38:35.103 --> 38:36.000
<i>We got here second.</i>

38:36.103 --> 38:38.620
And again, we're leaving late.

38:39.862 --> 38:42.689
She is not getting this. Oh.

38:42.793 --> 38:44.551
<i>The partners that
were not doing the challenge</i>

38:44.655 --> 38:47.620
<i>that were left
were so, like, frustrated</i>

38:47.724 --> 38:49.689
because it took
their partners so long.

38:49.793 --> 38:51.172
There's four left.

38:51.275 --> 38:53.655
I mean, if I get this,
I'm gonna cry.

38:53.758 --> 38:55.551
And I never want to see
another motorcycle again.

38:55.655 --> 38:57.517
- Ever.
- You got it, Will.

38:58.586 --> 39:00.758
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

39:00.862 --> 39:01.965
I just dropped it.

39:02.068 --> 39:03.517
You got this, babe.

39:03.620 --> 39:05.827
All right.
I'm gonna put this brake in.

39:05.931 --> 39:07.620
Slow and steady.

39:08.620 --> 39:10.000
Slow and steady?

39:11.689 --> 39:14.448
Now I'm putting on the, the
second brake on the front wheel.

39:14.551 --> 39:16.965
This is your jam, boo.
Kill it, kill it.

39:17.068 --> 39:19.310
It was definitely
a Roadblock that was catered

39:19.413 --> 39:21.344
<i>towards technicality
and attention to detail.</i>

39:22.344 --> 39:23.241
That is so Rich.

39:23.344 --> 39:24.620
Yeah, baby.

39:24.724 --> 39:26.551
I like when you twist things on.

39:28.517 --> 39:31.689
Sorry, Derek.
You look concerned.

39:33.034 --> 39:34.448
Don't know
what the issue is here.

39:34.551 --> 39:36.034
Claire has
a couple screws loose.

39:36.137 --> 39:38.655
I guess, I... I definitely
had screws loose today.

39:38.758 --> 39:40.344
He makes that look so easy.

39:40.448 --> 39:41.689
This is killing me.

39:41.793 --> 39:43.655
Just impossible to even watch.

39:43.758 --> 39:45.413
Even this Ducati guy's like,
"Come on, man."

39:45.517 --> 39:46.655
Can I get a check?

39:46.758 --> 39:48.068
Trust in her.

39:48.172 --> 39:49.620
Man.

39:49.724 --> 39:51.413
Don't worry.
Just have confidence.

39:51.517 --> 39:54.172
Be supportive. And not just
outwardly, but in your heart.

39:54.275 --> 39:56.448
- Okay?
- I just can't.
I'm so drained.

39:56.551 --> 39:58.379
Support her in your heart,
and I'm serious.

39:59.413 --> 40:01.827
Please...

40:03.137 --> 40:04.034
Yes!

40:04.137 --> 40:05.655
Oh, my God!

40:05.758 --> 40:08.448
<i>The Roadblock
was really, really painful.</i>

40:08.551 --> 40:10.137
And not fun at all.

40:10.241 --> 40:12.275
<i>- Yeah, uh,
not fun for either of us.
- Yeah.</i>

40:12.379 --> 40:14.310
- Check.
- Let's just leave
this forsaken place.

40:14.413 --> 40:15.586
Come on, babe.

40:15.689 --> 40:16.344
- Check.
- Check.
- We got it.

40:16.448 --> 40:18.103
Let's do it.

40:18.206 --> 40:20.000
- Thank you.
- Good job, babe.

40:20.103 --> 40:21.068
- Okay.
- Yes!

40:21.172 --> 40:23.068
- Oh, yes.
- Good job, Will!

40:23.172 --> 40:24.413
- Check.
- Come on.

40:24.517 --> 40:27.379
- Yes, Q!
- Check, please. Uh, check.

40:27.482 --> 40:29.034
Let's go, I know, I know.
I know that was hard.

40:29.137 --> 40:30.137
- Come on. <i>
- Grazie.</i>

40:30.241 --> 40:31.241
You got it, boo.

40:31.344 --> 40:32.448
You got it.

40:32.551 --> 40:34.310
Let's skedaddle.

40:34.413 --> 40:35.862
Come on, Richie.

40:35.965 --> 40:37.586
All right, babe. Come on.

40:37.689 --> 40:39.379
See all these teams
that were here?

40:39.482 --> 40:41.068
I was really
confident in my husband,

40:41.172 --> 40:44.137
<i>but as teams continued to leave,
I think we were very anxious.</i>

40:44.241 --> 40:45.724
Let's get out of here.

40:45.827 --> 40:48.275
<i>Trying to catch up
is very stressful.</i>

40:51.551 --> 40:53.344
I'm sending to you energy, honey.

40:53.448 --> 40:55.586
It's from the universe,
I'm sending it to you.

40:55.689 --> 40:57.413
- Yes, baby.
- Strength.

40:59.620 --> 41:02.517
Balance. And focus.

41:03.551 --> 41:04.896
Yes, sweetie.

41:05.000 --> 41:05.896
Check, please.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.344
The highest in me, my love.

41:13.517 --> 41:14.655
All right.

41:14.758 --> 41:15.931
<i>Grazie.</i>

41:16.034 --> 41:17.241
<i>Seeing Rich and Dom</i>

41:17.344 --> 41:18.724
<i>leave out ahead of us,
you know,</i>

41:18.827 --> 41:20.620
<i>after we started off
first today,</i>

41:20.724 --> 41:23.310
it was, it was,
it was discouraging.

41:23.413 --> 41:24.793
All right, babe.
We got to move fast.

41:26.655 --> 41:27.931
We're in last place.

41:28.034 --> 41:29.551
- The Mega Leg.
- Milano Firenze.

41:29.655 --> 41:31.689
Head towards Florence.

41:31.793 --> 41:32.931
We're going
in the right direction.

41:33.034 --> 41:35.103
Peace out, Bologna.

41:35.206 --> 41:36.620
Bye, Bologna.

41:36.724 --> 41:38.034
<i>When a race is over, it's over.</i>

41:40.103 --> 41:42.275
Let's go, baby.

41:42.379 --> 41:43.586
<i>And no one wants to go home.</i>

41:43.689 --> 41:45.413
The pressure's definitely on.

41:45.517 --> 41:47.551
There's a pack
racing for first place

41:47.655 --> 41:49.793
and a pack that's racing
not to be last right now.

41:49.896 --> 41:51.827
<i>They're hungry
just like we're hungry.</i>

41:51.931 --> 41:53.379
- Yep.
- What do you do about it?

41:53.482 --> 41:57.000
I was shocked to see Glenda
and Lumumba show up so late.

41:57.103 --> 41:58.724
No one wants to go home. Nobody.

41:58.827 --> 42:03.586
We are coming from
the Roadblock of death.

42:03.689 --> 42:05.241
You still with me, babe?

42:05.344 --> 42:06.655
I'm still with you, babe.
