[Webson] <i>I don't have the right
words for what happened that day.</i>

01:54.531 --> 01:56.998
But he was a hero, no question.

01:57.034 --> 01:59.458
Captain Conway's conduct was heroic.

01:59.494 --> 02:00.627
A hero.

02:00.663 --> 02:03.295
Army Captain Craig Squire had
been captured by the Taliban,

02:03.331 --> 02:05.547
held hostage in the Kandahar province.

02:05.583 --> 02:07.341
We realized the intel was bad.

02:07.377 --> 02:09.630
By the time we found him,
we'd started taking fire.

02:11.506 --> 02:13.765
<i>It was like a death
garden or something.</i>

02:13.801 --> 02:16.976
Captain Conway got out of
the plane and got Squire out.

02:17.012 --> 02:18.231
Don't even ask me how.

02:18.931 --> 02:20.772
[Bracco] <i>This election
is too important.</i>

02:20.808 --> 02:26.027
You have a choice between
Francis Underwood and a real hero.

02:26.063 --> 02:29.822
This is what happens when you
throw around a word like "war."

02:29.858 --> 02:31.443
All hell breaks loose.

02:32.695 --> 02:36.412
He saved Squire. He saved all of us.

02:36.448 --> 02:39.081
[Conway] <i>War is real.</i>

02:39.117 --> 02:40.953
[announcer] <i>Paid for
by Americans for Truth.</i>

02:41.870 --> 02:43.745
I don't know how many times
I have to go through this,

02:43.747 --> 02:45.455
but my campaign had
nothing to do with that ad.

02:45.457 --> 02:46.798
That was a super PAC.

02:46.834 --> 02:49.133
<i>- I know, but...</i>
- But those soldiers, though.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.253
They're the ones.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.887
This country owes them a lot.

02:52.923 --> 02:54.672
<i>- But that ad is on all the time.</i>
- You wanna know why?

02:54.674 --> 02:57.934
Because Frank Underwood has
failed to keep this country safe.

02:57.970 --> 02:59.143
The death of James Miller,

02:59.179 --> 03:03.022
the so-called ICO attack at
Capital East Telecom network...

03:03.058 --> 03:05.441
<i>Wait, wait, wait. Are you
saying ICO wasn't responsible?</i>

03:05.477 --> 03:06.693
I'm saying it doesn't matter.

03:06.729 --> 03:09.486
The Internet went down
on the president's watch.

03:09.522 --> 03:11.698
<i>- Don't you think ICO was...</i>
- Now listen, Fred...

03:11.734 --> 03:14.826
<i>- No, ICO is a real threat.
- There's a lot of people waiting</i>

03:14.862 --> 03:17.244
<i>and I promised one question per person.</i>

03:17.280 --> 03:21.118
It was great talking to you, and
please don't forget to vote tomorrow.

03:22.702 --> 03:24.537
Now, how long have
we been going, anyway?

03:25.789 --> 03:27.588
- Four hours.
- Four hours.

03:27.624 --> 03:29.298
That means we got 20 hours to go

03:29.334 --> 03:31.926
and I haven't even had the chance
to thank my friends at Pollyhop

03:31.962 --> 03:35.221
for making this all possible
and live streaming this event.

03:35.257 --> 03:36.638
Benjamin Grant and his crew.

03:36.674 --> 03:39.641
[chuckles] All right.
What's the next question?

03:39.677 --> 03:43.020
Annie? Annie from Maine.
What's on your mind?

03:43.056 --> 03:44.396
Was Fred one of ours?

03:44.432 --> 03:46.357
I think so. We're gonna
keep hitting the ad.

03:46.393 --> 03:50.486
[coughs] LeAnn's got callers
lined up. Are you there yet?

03:50.522 --> 03:53.155
Almost. Then back on the plane.

03:53.191 --> 03:55.366
- I'm about to go on.
<i>- Ohio, still?</i>

03:55.402 --> 03:58.410
<i>Oh, yeah. And how's he looking? Conway?</i>

03:58.446 --> 04:00.747
Well, he's only four hours
in. It's not sustainable.

04:00.783 --> 04:03.415
<i>- But is he commanding?</i>
- He's arrogant, Francis.

04:03.451 --> 04:05.584
- [woman] Mr. President?
- [Frank] I have to go.

04:05.620 --> 04:07.539
<i>Okay. See you in Gettysburg.</i>

04:08.581 --> 04:11.716
<i>You're saying it doesn't matter if
Underwood knew about pay-for-play?</i>

04:11.752 --> 04:15.052
Well, I'm saying it's bad either way.

04:15.088 --> 04:18.680
He either stole the
presidency from his own party,

04:18.716 --> 04:22.309
or he was vice president
in a corrupt administration.

04:22.345 --> 04:25.432
But it's important that we
let the committee do its job.

04:26.016 --> 04:27.648
So thanks for your call, Annie.

04:27.684 --> 04:30.818
Arthur Capo from Del Rey Beach,
Hawaii. Arthur, how you doing?

04:30.854 --> 04:32.981
<i>Why did they want to talk to you?</i>

04:33.899 --> 04:36.407
I'm sorry, who? Uh, what's
your question, Arthur?

04:36.443 --> 04:38.403
<i>Josh Masterson and Zachary...</i>

04:39.571 --> 04:42.914
<i>I forget his last name. But the
terrorists who killed Jim Miller.</i>

04:42.950 --> 04:45.291
Right. Uh, well...

04:45.327 --> 04:47.035
- [inhales deeply]
- All I know is what they said

04:47.037 --> 04:48.627
in their list of demands.

04:48.663 --> 04:51.380
And they believed I would
be elected president.

04:51.416 --> 04:54.383
<i>But really, why? Why you?</i>

04:54.419 --> 04:58.429
<i>I successfully negotiated the release
of Caroline and Melissa Miller.</i>

04:58.465 --> 05:01.426
- [Arthur] <i>But not Jim Miller.</i>
<i>- I wasn't given the chance.</i>

05:02.970 --> 05:06.306
What's your read on him, the
way he answers those questions?

05:07.765 --> 05:10.393
- He's hiding something.
- Right.

05:11.436 --> 05:12.813
But it doesn't matter.

05:13.897 --> 05:17.442
He's modern. He makes
the presidency accessible.

05:18.610 --> 05:21.738
I mean, don't you want to see
the candidate stay up all night?

05:27.660 --> 05:29.662
Are you calling Francis old?

05:40.757 --> 05:43.682
[woman] I appreciate the
applause, ladies and gentlemen,

05:43.718 --> 05:48.145
but I imagine it's for the
woman you really came to see.

05:48.181 --> 05:49.849
[crowd cheering]

05:50.808 --> 05:53.896
"These are dangerous times."

05:54.812 --> 05:56.403
These are dangerous times.

05:56.439 --> 05:58.197
[woman] ...of the United States,

05:58.233 --> 06:01.111
- Claire Underwood.
- [crowd cheering]

06:02.195 --> 06:04.990
He's only a couple years
older than me, you know.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.535
[crowd continues cheering]

06:17.169 --> 06:20.511
Thank you. Thank you, Nevada!

06:20.547 --> 06:22.424
[crowd continues cheering]

06:26.094 --> 06:29.514
I really appreciate you all
coming out here this morning.

06:31.599 --> 06:36.944
No substitute for retail
politics. Especially her brand.

06:36.980 --> 06:38.523
[Claire] Thank you.

06:39.942 --> 06:41.740
[coughs] Could you get
me some water, please?

06:41.776 --> 06:43.653
- Hello, everyone.
- [crowd applauding]

06:44.779 --> 06:46.203
Thank you so much.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.200
Thank you very much. That's very kind.

06:49.742 --> 06:51.625
Oh, thanks so much.

06:51.661 --> 06:54.545
Oh, now stop that. Stop it, stop
it. Enough, enough, enough. Enough.

06:54.581 --> 06:57.131
It's embarrassing,
all of that adulation.

06:57.167 --> 07:00.009
Hello, nice to see you. Thank
you so much for coming out.

07:00.045 --> 07:01.379
Much appreciated.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.680
- Jack!
- Great speech, Mr. President.

07:04.716 --> 07:06.091
It's like you're saying
what I'm thinking.

07:06.093 --> 07:09.560
Well, that is the idea.
[clears throat] Thank you.

07:09.596 --> 07:11.979
Uh, I'm a little worried
about the Conway thing, though.

07:12.015 --> 07:15.149
- Bringing up a lot of questions.
- But not a lot of answers.

07:15.185 --> 07:17.435
Yeah, and we don't need to
keep hearing about that article

07:17.437 --> 07:19.395
the day before the election.
What are we doing about it?

07:19.397 --> 07:21.530
Well, we're here, Jack.

07:21.566 --> 07:24.866
We are fighting back
one handshake at a time.

07:24.902 --> 07:28.787
Gwendolyn, you look absolutely stunning.
May I get a photograph, please, Steve?

07:28.823 --> 07:31.576
Could you do this, please?
Make sure you cut him out.

07:32.535 --> 07:36.128
We have Jeff from Corpus Christi,
Texas. How are you doing today, Jeff?

07:36.164 --> 07:38.547
<i>We saw the ad. About the rescue.</i>

07:38.583 --> 07:42.009
You know, Jeff, I feel like we
have been through this already.

07:42.045 --> 07:43.630
<i>You saved my brother's life, sir.</i>

07:44.589 --> 07:45.923
<i>Craig Squire.</i>

07:47.384 --> 07:50.887
Captain Squire. That's...
that's your brother?

07:54.141 --> 07:55.558
<i>Captain.</i>

07:59.187 --> 08:00.522
<i>Remember me?</i>

08:01.564 --> 08:03.822
I do remember. Of course I remember.

08:03.858 --> 08:05.992
[Craig] <i>I didn't think
you wanted talk about it.</i>

08:06.028 --> 08:09.161
We lived through it.
That's enough, isn't it?

08:09.197 --> 08:12.039
<i>I never got to thank you and tell you...</i>

08:12.075 --> 08:15.209
Captain Squire, you
would've done the same.

08:15.245 --> 08:18.670
<i>I don't know. I was in there.</i>

08:18.706 --> 08:21.798
<i>They were tossing bodies on top
of me, one after the other...</i>

08:21.834 --> 08:23.003
<i>I was already dead.</i>

08:24.004 --> 08:27.888
<i>That's not right. It's like
I've been dead once already.</i>

08:27.924 --> 08:30.682
<i>But the bodies... the way
they were stuck together.</i>

08:30.718 --> 08:32.476
<i>And the heat and the smell...</i>

08:32.511 --> 08:34.561
<i>But you know when you were
pulling me out, remember?</i>

08:34.597 --> 08:39.816
I... I don't remember much, actually.
It all happened pretty quick.

08:39.852 --> 08:40.985
<i>I know you heard it.</i>

08:41.020 --> 08:42.986
You have to get him
out of this question.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.855
He doesn't like talking
about this. You know that.

08:44.857 --> 08:47.324
- Hannah, let's talk.
<i>- Come on, man. I know you did.</i>

08:47.360 --> 08:50.536
I was just trying to get us
out of there as fast as I could.

08:50.572 --> 08:53.075
[stutters] Craig, we're here.

08:54.576 --> 08:56.833
- We made it. <i>
- Yeah, but...</i>

08:56.869 --> 08:59.961
- You gotta live your life.
<i>- Thanks for taking our call.</i>

08:59.997 --> 09:01.374
Thank you.

09:07.880 --> 09:10.423
[LeAnn] He didn't call him out
enough. He didn't get Conway to...

09:10.425 --> 09:13.095
Look... he did what he could.

09:14.887 --> 09:17.271
[LeAnn] What did he hear?
What did he mean by that?

09:17.307 --> 09:18.939
I don't know. It's between Will and him.

09:18.975 --> 09:22.401
He's wanted Will to come clean
about it for a long time, but...

09:22.437 --> 09:23.646
it didn't happen.

09:24.564 --> 09:27.739
Which is why, for Craig's sake, we
need to get them back on the phone.

09:27.775 --> 09:31.743
Miss Harvey, you've
been on us for months.

09:31.779 --> 09:35.164
I'm sorry it didn't work out. If
this means the deal's off, okay.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.790
We can always find a place to go.

09:36.826 --> 09:39.085
Just let me talk to him again.
We wouldn't want him to...

09:39.121 --> 09:41.295
Jesus Christ! My brother
has been through enough.

09:41.331 --> 09:42.582
We're done.

09:43.916 --> 09:45.252
I need you to leave.

09:51.549 --> 09:52.884
[door opens]

09:53.801 --> 09:55.178
[sighs]

09:58.431 --> 09:59.474
[Usher] He's doing great.

10:00.267 --> 10:01.601
Is he?

10:02.560 --> 10:03.728
That ad's playing for us.

10:07.064 --> 10:10.116
Look, I... I agreed to this.

10:10.152 --> 10:12.618
- But I know my husband.
- I know you do.

10:12.654 --> 10:15.662
And those questions
were to be expected, yes?

10:15.698 --> 10:17.909
It's a good thing
Squire changed his mind.

10:19.202 --> 10:22.211
We can pull some tape and put
something together tonight.

10:22.247 --> 10:24.166
Hit some markets in the morning.

10:24.874 --> 10:26.293
When it's time to vote...

10:27.335 --> 10:28.753
Will saved his life.

10:30.213 --> 10:31.506
This is too much.

10:32.424 --> 10:34.225
I don't want any more
questions about the war.

10:34.259 --> 10:36.142
That's not gonna work.

10:36.178 --> 10:37.684
Look, I can show you numbers,

10:37.720 --> 10:39.895
I can show you how well
it's all playing for us.

10:39.931 --> 10:44.065
- What I'm saying, Mark, is that this...
- I've been at this a long time, Hannah.

10:44.101 --> 10:46.318
You know, when Marshall
told me you were available...

10:46.354 --> 10:50.107
Marshall and I go way back. The
timing is right for all of us, right?

10:51.901 --> 10:54.451
- We're very grateful.
- He will tell you, I don't get involved,

10:54.487 --> 10:58.241
not this late in the game, unless
I know I can make a difference.

11:01.118 --> 11:03.502
So whatever happened to
Will with Squire, whatever...

11:03.538 --> 11:06.416
- It's not...
- I don't wanna know. I don't need to know.

11:07.834 --> 11:10.628
But whatever pain he's
carrying about what happened...

11:12.297 --> 11:13.506
it's working for us.

11:14.632 --> 11:16.848
So, this is what I need from you.

11:16.884 --> 11:21.806
To go back out there and just make
sure he makes it through until morning.

11:25.852 --> 11:28.313
- [sighs]
- Hey.

11:30.773 --> 11:32.400
He has a chance to be a fine president.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.862
A great president.

11:38.323 --> 11:41.243
- Even better.
- [sighs]

11:42.244 --> 11:43.745
Because we could use one.

11:47.249 --> 11:51.049
There's a reason that Squire
didn't appear in that ad.

11:51.085 --> 11:52.962
I'm just nailing down the specifics.

11:56.883 --> 11:59.933
- Let's bring Doug in on this.
<i>- He's on his way to Philly.</i>

11:59.969 --> 12:01.935
And with all due respect, sir,

12:01.971 --> 12:04.140
his skill set doesn't
necessarily apply here.

12:05.892 --> 12:08.275
Do you know how long Doug
has worked for me, LeAnn?

12:08.311 --> 12:09.360
<i>Not exactly, no.</i>

12:09.396 --> 12:12.529
Well, it's just this side of
forever. I know everything about him.

12:12.565 --> 12:15.366
His strengths, his
weaknesses, his skill set

12:15.402 --> 12:18.112
and the contents of his soul.

12:19.489 --> 12:23.410
- I hope you're not questioning my loyalty.
- [coughs]

12:25.161 --> 12:27.878
I just like to know about the
people who work for me, LeAnn.

12:27.914 --> 12:31.840
- I'm pretty straightforward. <i>
- I don't believe that for a second.</i>

12:31.876 --> 12:33.842
<i>The first time I sat down with Doug,</i>

12:33.878 --> 12:36.553
it was more of a confession
than a conversation.

12:36.589 --> 12:40.927
He told me about his drinking, his
past. He was completely open with me.

12:42.219 --> 12:44.520
I don't think we can
rely on Craig Squire.

12:44.556 --> 12:46.516
<i>Then why am I still talking to you?</i>

12:47.517 --> 12:50.562
I'm not hiding the
contents of my soul, sir.

12:51.187 --> 12:54.905
- Reach out to Vanessa Morrison. <i>
- I already reached out to the director.</i>

12:54.941 --> 12:59.034
Yes, but Doug hasn't. So have him do it
and then you come up with something else

12:59.070 --> 13:01.912
before Conway is done
with his little sideshow.

13:01.948 --> 13:03.830
<i>And in terms of what comes next,</i>

13:03.866 --> 13:06.875
<i>I adjusted the opening remarks
and cut some from the stump.</i>

13:06.911 --> 13:08.335
The stump is just fine.

13:08.371 --> 13:09.851
- Thank you very much.
- [phone beeps]

13:11.958 --> 13:13.549
Get me the First Lady, please.

13:13.585 --> 13:15.926
<i>Well, the... the short answer is</i>

13:15.962 --> 13:17.928
<i>in a democracy, everyone
has the same rights...</i>

13:17.964 --> 13:20.049
- [phone ringing]
<i>- The same opportunities.</i>

13:21.468 --> 13:22.516
Hello.

13:22.552 --> 13:25.096
Do the people around us
understand what it takes?

13:26.431 --> 13:28.647
Look, I know Conway's getting a bump,

13:28.683 --> 13:31.608
but it doesn't mean we can't
surmount it in the next 24 hours.

13:31.644 --> 13:35.357
Do they know what we
have done to get this far?

13:36.691 --> 13:38.574
Tom is sitting across from me right now.

13:38.610 --> 13:40.945
<i>I don't care who you're
sitting next to, Claire.</i>

13:42.530 --> 13:46.117
We're all doing everything
we can as fast as we can.

13:49.537 --> 13:51.837
I don't like it. I
don't like chasing this.

13:51.873 --> 13:54.667
<i>- What's your next stop?</i>
- [coughs]

13:55.585 --> 14:00.507
- We, uh... We're in Scranton in 20.
- You need to save your voice.

14:02.800 --> 14:05.302
[clears throat] I'll see
you on the battlefield.

14:14.771 --> 14:15.980
How's the president doing?

14:18.775 --> 14:21.444
He's acting like he's
still 30 years old.

14:26.115 --> 14:27.116
We both are.

14:29.118 --> 14:32.414
Is that good... or bad?

14:34.916 --> 14:37.126
That depends on if we win or lose.

14:38.795 --> 14:43.138
<i>Because I'm a vet and I'm still
not clear on exactly what happened.</i>

14:43.174 --> 14:46.558
You know, I think everything has been
said by the soldiers who were there.

14:46.594 --> 14:51.271
<i>No. 'Cause your plane, was it shot
down or was it a planned rescue?</i>

14:51.307 --> 14:53.476
Planned, yes.

14:54.101 --> 14:56.527
Until the plan had to change.

14:56.563 --> 15:00.071
- I think you get the idea.
<i>- No, I don't get it, sir.</i>

15:00.107 --> 15:01.990
<i>- You were a pilot, right?</i>
- Yes.

15:02.026 --> 15:04.325
<i>So why were your boots
even on the ground?</i>

15:04.361 --> 15:06.406
Our intel was flawed.

15:08.157 --> 15:13.037
Our intel was flawed and I...
I had to step in. I had to.

15:16.958 --> 15:18.250
<i>Hi, Mike.</i>

15:19.168 --> 15:21.843
<i>My husband is a humble man.</i>

15:21.879 --> 15:25.096
<i>You're never going to get the
details of his bravery that day.</i>

15:25.132 --> 15:26.676
<i>At least, not from him.</i>

15:28.010 --> 15:29.893
<i>To me, his comrades say it all.</i>

15:29.929 --> 15:33.689
<i>Will is a man who is equipped to
deal with whatever comes at him.</i>

15:33.725 --> 15:36.650
And now, I'd like to put in a
word on a more practical matter,

15:36.686 --> 15:38.610
these new centralized voting centers.

15:38.646 --> 15:41.863
Because we've had lots
of calls and questions.

15:41.899 --> 15:46.618
Whichever candidate you support, it's
essential that you get out to vote.

15:46.654 --> 15:50.914
Ask a neighbor for a ride or
call your local party office.

15:50.950 --> 15:54.370
This race is too close for complacency.

15:54.996 --> 15:56.914
[crowd cheering]

16:03.963 --> 16:05.548
[inaudible]

16:10.720 --> 16:12.346
[man] You got my vote!

16:16.934 --> 16:20.772
- [crowd chanting] Underwood!
- Thank you so much.

16:23.232 --> 16:25.151
Thank you. Thank you.

16:28.905 --> 16:30.370
Thank you so much. Thank you.

16:30.406 --> 16:33.582
[coughing] Oh, thank you.

16:33.618 --> 16:37.002
Could you also get me a tea
with honey, please? [coughs]

16:37.038 --> 16:38.913
- Are you gonna be all right to speak?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

16:38.915 --> 16:41.047
- Listen to your voice, Francis.
- Stop.

16:41.083 --> 16:43.049
You have been running
yourself into the ground,

16:43.085 --> 16:44.843
you haven't slept for days.

16:44.879 --> 16:47.638
Why don't you kick off the speech,

16:47.674 --> 16:49.598
let me take over, and
then I will explain to...

16:49.634 --> 16:52.350
That the president's lost his
voice? No, you're not gonna say that.

16:52.386 --> 16:54.978
We're not gonna have that headline
as we enter the final stretch.

16:55.014 --> 16:58.815
Especially since Sir Lancelot is
out there yapping all day long.

16:58.851 --> 17:01.485
I'm not really sure that
Conway's a Sir Lancelot.

17:01.521 --> 17:04.488
Oh, really? Then who would
you assign that role to?

17:04.523 --> 17:07.068
[announcer speaking
indistinctly over PA]

17:11.739 --> 17:13.115
[gargles]

17:14.075 --> 17:17.834
[spits] God, I hate to
waste that. Excuse me.

17:17.869 --> 17:19.795
There was a young man in line,

17:19.830 --> 17:21.705
on the other side, sort of
against that second door.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.173
Six foot tall...

17:23.209 --> 17:27.010
- Maybe just give us a moment.
- Sure.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.220
Can you see if you can get
some contact information?

17:29.256 --> 17:31.175
Or pull him out if you can. Thank you.

17:33.928 --> 17:37.270
I didn't mean take over. I just
meant let's appear as a ticket.

17:37.306 --> 17:39.773
- "Are we united or are we divided?"
- Francis...

17:39.809 --> 17:42.067
"Here at Gettysburg, one
of the bloodiest battles..."

17:42.103 --> 17:43.354
I know your speech.

17:44.480 --> 17:47.113
But can you finish? You have
to know how to finish, Claire.

17:47.149 --> 17:50.075
[Winters] I have the distinct
honor of introducing you to,

17:50.111 --> 17:53.078
God-willing and the creek don't rise,

17:53.114 --> 17:57.541
the current and next President
of the United States of America,

17:57.577 --> 18:00.460
- Francis Underwood!
- [crowd cheering]

18:00.496 --> 18:02.164
[band playing]

18:10.882 --> 18:14.933
[Frank] Thank you. Thank
you, Congressman Winters,

18:14.969 --> 18:17.597
- and thank you, Pennsylvania.
- [crowd cheering]

18:22.977 --> 18:26.527
And my running mate, my wife,

18:26.563 --> 18:30.490
and my friend and my
partner, Claire Underwood.

18:30.526 --> 18:32.319
[crowd cheering]

18:37.491 --> 18:41.663
[Matthews] I've always got a
few minutes for Doug Stamper.

18:42.955 --> 18:47.841
Again, sorry to keep you waiting.
You sure I can't offer you something?

18:47.877 --> 18:49.295
[Doug] I don't drink, Governor.

18:50.797 --> 18:53.096
Well, I got club soda, tonic...

18:53.132 --> 18:55.641
You said you were going to
establish voting centers.

18:55.677 --> 18:58.059
I was. I tried.

18:58.095 --> 19:01.062
I got pushback from the precinct
captains like you wouldn't believe.

19:01.098 --> 19:05.483
- You said you were gonna deploy troops.
- I tried that, too.

19:05.519 --> 19:08.737
I floated the order past
Roger Frank at the ACLU.

19:08.773 --> 19:12.157
He mentioned it to Barney
Leonard at the Black Coalition.

19:12.193 --> 19:14.826
And within two hours, I
got eight angry phone calls

19:14.862 --> 19:17.578
telling me exactly what would happen

19:17.614 --> 19:20.617
if I chose to protect exurban
areas instead of Philly.

19:23.245 --> 19:25.164
You don't want to lie to me, Governor.

19:26.207 --> 19:28.292
I just came from
Barney Leonard's office.

19:29.210 --> 19:31.467
- You wanna change your story?
- Please.

19:31.503 --> 19:33.984
Barney's gonna tell you that he
threatened a fucking race riot.

19:34.006 --> 19:38.886
You fucking lied, straight up, to
the President of the United States.

19:41.388 --> 19:42.389
Doug.

19:43.766 --> 19:44.767
Doug.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.896
- Barney Leonard's office, please.
- Put the phone down.

19:49.814 --> 19:51.565
It's Doug Stamper.

19:52.149 --> 19:54.694
Yes, I need him one more time.

20:00.950 --> 20:04.203
Fine. Hang it up.

20:08.833 --> 20:10.501
I'll get you your troops.

20:13.170 --> 20:14.546
You want the truth?

20:16.423 --> 20:19.385
Not interested. I had that coming in.

20:20.928 --> 20:22.096
It's over.

20:23.014 --> 20:25.682
Underwood's gonna lose
tomorrow. He's done.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.811
And when he's done, you're done.

20:30.479 --> 20:34.942
You'll have nothing left. And
then, you'll just disappear.

20:38.279 --> 20:40.281
Thank you for your time, Governor.

20:59.175 --> 21:02.804
What would it take to federalize
the National Guard in Pennsylvania?

21:19.028 --> 21:20.321
[knocking on door]

21:26.618 --> 21:29.538
The president asked me to get him
some information about Eric Rawlings.

21:30.206 --> 21:32.798
- Who?
- From the Gettysburg event.

21:32.834 --> 21:35.211
Ah, I'll give it to him.

21:58.234 --> 22:02.202
[Catherine] Muhammed
Kalabi, 34, Syrian national.

22:02.238 --> 22:06.039
Local assets confirm his
ID with high confidence.

22:06.075 --> 22:08.744
Kalabi has strong connections to ICO.

22:09.661 --> 22:11.914
Bombing in Beirut last fall.

22:13.540 --> 22:18.087
A month before Beirut,
with Ahmadi, in Cairo.

22:20.589 --> 22:25.183
Currently, sir, there are four
Muhammed Kalabis in the United States.

22:25.219 --> 22:29.104
Two are approximately the
same age as the ICO Kalabi,

22:29.140 --> 22:32.398
and one entered the United
States three weeks ago

22:32.434 --> 22:35.193
from Afghanistan by way of Canada.

22:35.229 --> 22:39.280
He's visiting his girlfriend in Tennessee
who works at a Knoxville bookstore.

22:39.316 --> 22:40.817
[coughing]

22:44.155 --> 22:46.240
So why are you bringing me all this?

22:47.658 --> 22:50.458
You asked for options, sir.

22:50.494 --> 22:52.961
To arrest Muhammed
Kalabi on election day?

22:52.997 --> 22:56.214
Cathy, what's gonna happen when he
tells the authorities he's the wrong one?

22:56.250 --> 22:58.008
But that would be after the election...

22:58.044 --> 23:00.044
Well, that might have played
three or four days ago, Cathy,

23:00.046 --> 23:01.422
but now it's too late.

23:04.508 --> 23:09.180
- Did you have this three or four days ago?
- I would have brought it to you, sir.

23:10.597 --> 23:13.899
[sighs] All right, well,
let's leave it at that.

23:13.935 --> 23:15.150
- [phone beeps]
- Send in Doug.

23:15.186 --> 23:16.853
The secretary is just leaving.

23:29.908 --> 23:33.996
That's all we have on the Squire
rescue. It's not enough, unfortunately.

23:37.166 --> 23:38.250
Sir...

23:40.086 --> 23:42.326
when it comes to Matthews, I
don't believe he'll deliver.

23:45.841 --> 23:50.268
Let's take this from his hands.
We need to protect the polls.

23:50.304 --> 23:51.644
The request won't come from you.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.513
The way this thing is built,
you're nowhere near it.

23:53.515 --> 23:54.933
Hold on a second.

23:56.143 --> 23:58.187
How are the numbers in Pennsylvania?

23:58.854 --> 24:01.404
They're good, but they're well
within the margin of error, sir.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.023
So we don't want to
look like we're shoving

24:03.025 --> 24:06.617
an armed unit of National Guards
down Jim Matthews' throat, right?

24:06.653 --> 24:10.455
- Right.
- So, I got a call from Barney Leonard.

24:10.491 --> 24:12.618
You pushed too hard, Doug.

24:18.499 --> 24:23.545
But look, we'll have four years to
take care of Matthews, and we will.

24:27.341 --> 24:29.385
But what if there was another way?

24:30.761 --> 24:33.853
[Conway] <i>I don't think anybody,
if they're honest with themselves,</i>

24:33.889 --> 24:37.273
<i>can say they truly trust
President Underwood.</i>

24:37.309 --> 24:39.317
<i>- Why should they?</i>
- [Laura and Doug panting]

24:39.353 --> 24:41.361
<i>With so many threats to our country,</i>

24:41.397 --> 24:44.691
<i>now it's more important than ever</i>
<i>to elect...</i> [continues indistinctly]

24:57.954 --> 25:00.588
[Conway] <i>...four years</i>
<i>of misguided priorities,</i>

25:00.624 --> 25:05.385
<i>backing the GOP into soliciting
private and special interests.</i>

25:05.421 --> 25:07.256
[stammers] You know what?

25:08.006 --> 25:09.383
What?

25:12.761 --> 25:16.432
- I wanna be that person.
- What person?

25:18.517 --> 25:21.687
The person that does this for,
like, an hour and then leaves.

25:22.688 --> 25:23.736
That's not what this...

25:23.772 --> 25:27.157
Doug, I've been having sex
for as long as you have.

25:27.193 --> 25:30.076
And when you called me,
that's what it sounded like.

25:30.112 --> 25:33.740
And I thought, "Great." But
I'm here now. Where are you?

25:47.254 --> 25:48.880
I should take you home.

25:51.592 --> 25:52.801
No.

25:54.178 --> 25:56.555
- You don't have to.
- Come on.

25:57.473 --> 25:59.641
- I'll take a cab.
- I'm taking you home.

26:01.268 --> 26:02.728
What is going on with you?

26:03.854 --> 26:05.736
[sighs]

26:05.772 --> 26:08.614
You're right. I shouldn't have called.

26:08.650 --> 26:10.026
I gotta get back to work.

26:15.073 --> 26:17.623
[reporter on TV] <i>Reports are pouring
in of protests being staged</i>

26:17.659 --> 26:20.710
<i>outside of many of our newly
established voting centers.</i>

26:20.746 --> 26:23.421
<i>Which begs the question,
are Americans fed up</i>

26:23.457 --> 26:27.175
<i>with our politicians' seemingly
unquenchable thirst for conflict?</i>

26:27.211 --> 26:30.761
<i>- Between Underwood's call for a formal...</i>
- Make a decision?

26:30.797 --> 26:34.682
<i>And the strong military
ticket on the Republican side?</i>

26:34.718 --> 26:38.096
- Basil Hayden's, double, neat.
- Basil Hayden?

26:40.474 --> 26:41.683
You're killing me, buddy.

26:46.480 --> 26:50.234
- What do you got?
- Bulleit's as good as it gets in here.

26:53.779 --> 26:55.156
I'll have that.

27:06.082 --> 27:09.384
- Woman?
- Work.

27:09.420 --> 27:12.714
Yeah, well, nothing's forever, man.

27:29.315 --> 27:33.109
Those two down there, and anyone else
who comes in here until that's gone.

27:34.820 --> 27:35.862
That's for you.

28:01.179 --> 28:02.306
[door opens]

28:19.865 --> 28:22.332
[inhales deeply]

28:22.368 --> 28:24.077
[exhales]

28:28.665 --> 28:29.791
[sighs]

28:33.629 --> 28:35.422
I couldn't sleep.

28:43.054 --> 28:44.431
Is it your throat?

28:46.850 --> 28:49.228
[sighs] Is it enough?

28:50.604 --> 28:52.147
What we're doing?

28:57.986 --> 28:59.280
I...

29:02.198 --> 29:03.409
Yes.

29:07.288 --> 29:09.420
Then why aren't we farther ahead?

29:09.456 --> 29:12.668
- Most of the polls have us...
- Oh, I don't trust the polls.

29:13.835 --> 29:17.130
With few exceptions, I don't
trust anyone or anything.

29:21.802 --> 29:24.471
We won't know for sure
until the vote's begun.

29:26.139 --> 29:29.142
But turnout for their
side is sure to be down.

29:31.437 --> 29:33.855
We almost had Conway today.

29:36.358 --> 29:38.360
And we did some damage.

29:39.152 --> 29:41.827
And maybe we don't
know what he's hiding,

29:41.863 --> 29:44.700
but the public knows
there's something out there.

29:47.619 --> 29:50.372
- Hmm.
- [Yates humming]

29:58.339 --> 30:00.882
He hums in his sleep sometimes.

30:03.009 --> 30:04.260
Hums?

30:05.596 --> 30:07.138
Like what?

30:13.520 --> 30:15.063
I don't know.

30:15.814 --> 30:17.816
Nothing recognizable.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.820
Does he do it often?

30:23.614 --> 30:25.281
Sometimes.

30:28.660 --> 30:32.288
- Do it for me. What's it sound like?
- [chuckles lightly]

30:34.040 --> 30:38.044
- Let's get you something for your throat.
- No, I'm fine. You go back to sleep.

30:47.220 --> 30:49.723
We're gonna get there tomorrow, Francis.

31:25.133 --> 31:29.519
[Conway on laptop] <i>So, I'm...</i>
<i>I'm at this fundraiser.</i>

31:29.555 --> 31:32.647
<i>It's a beautiful house on
the beach in Amagansett,</i>

31:32.683 --> 31:37.985
<i>and I've been dancing all night
with this incredible girl,</i>

31:38.021 --> 31:39.945
<i>way out of my league.</i>

31:39.981 --> 31:43.783
<i>But it's late, very late,</i>

31:43.819 --> 31:47.703
<i>and I'm a very responsible
young man, so...</i>

31:47.739 --> 31:50.241
<i>I sneak upstairs to get my jacket.</i>

31:53.369 --> 31:55.038
<i>But lo and behold...</i>

31:56.081 --> 31:57.749
<i>she's following me.</i>

31:59.167 --> 32:02.885
<i>And I see my reflection in
the hallway mirror and...</i>

32:02.921 --> 32:06.049
[chuckles] <i>I'm just sweating like a pig.</i>

32:07.300 --> 32:09.636
[chuckles] <i>My heart's racing.</i>

32:11.012 --> 32:12.848
<i>And she walks up behind me.</i>

32:16.602 --> 32:18.479
<i>And as I turn...</i>

32:19.438 --> 32:22.483
<i>I see the moonlight on her face...</i>

32:24.610 --> 32:26.903
<i>and everything just slows down.</i>

32:32.117 --> 32:33.577
And that's how we met.

32:35.370 --> 32:37.706
- Me and Hannah. [chuckles]
- [laughs]

32:40.041 --> 32:43.300
<i>Well, I'm glad to hear I'm
not the only one up this late.</i>

32:43.336 --> 32:46.386
<i>Mr. President, do you
have a question for me?</i>

32:46.422 --> 32:49.223
[Frank] <i>No, I don't. But I
thought I would give you the chance</i>

32:49.259 --> 32:52.059
<i>to ask me a question. Just one.</i>

32:52.095 --> 32:55.145
[Conway chuckles] I'm not sure
I have any questions for you.

32:55.181 --> 32:57.482
[Frank] <i>Oh, don't be shy, Will.</i>

32:57.518 --> 32:59.650
<i>I mean, after all, this
is a rare opportunity.</i>

32:59.686 --> 33:02.027
<i>Just between you and me.</i>

33:02.063 --> 33:04.947
<i>It's just you and me and all
the other Americans out there</i>

33:04.983 --> 33:06.492
<i>having trouble sleeping tonight.</i>

33:06.495 --> 33:10.703
Well, that's because they know that
tomorrow's vote will decide their future.

33:10.739 --> 33:12.741
So that's the question then, isn't it?

33:13.659 --> 33:15.332
Who does the future belong to?

33:15.368 --> 33:18.168
<i>Well, I don't think anyone
but God can answer that one.</i>

33:18.204 --> 33:21.625
<i>All we can do is make a case
for ourselves while we're here.</i>

33:23.794 --> 33:25.253
Okay.

33:27.297 --> 33:28.715
Here's my question.

33:31.176 --> 33:35.686
I successfully negotiated the release
of Caroline and Melissa Miller.

33:35.722 --> 33:37.432
<i>Then you stepped in.</i>

33:38.850 --> 33:41.853
<i>You didn't let me finish the job. Why?</i>

33:43.522 --> 33:45.821
Do you really want me to
answer that question, Will?

33:45.857 --> 33:49.027
- Because I'm not sure you do.
<i>- Oh, I do.</i>

33:52.488 --> 33:56.159
Because they knew they could take
advantage of you. They saw it.

33:57.160 --> 33:59.334
<i>- How's that, sir?
- They felt it.</i>

33:59.370 --> 34:01.378
<i>Whatever happened to you overseas,</i>

34:01.414 --> 34:04.507
<i>there's no reason to
feel guilty or ashamed.</i>

34:04.543 --> 34:08.797
<i>I served my country. I did what I did...</i>

34:09.715 --> 34:11.717
<i>because it's what I had to do.</i>

34:13.092 --> 34:14.719
<i>Not like some others.</i>

34:16.346 --> 34:19.725
I've been in public office
my entire adult life, Will.

34:21.768 --> 34:24.694
The truth is, I went to
school with guys like you.

34:24.730 --> 34:27.690
Good looking guys
with good intentions...

34:28.859 --> 34:30.741
just like you.

34:30.777 --> 34:32.402
And I mean that sincerely.

34:33.487 --> 34:36.664
And I want you to know that
whatever happens tomorrow,

34:36.699 --> 34:38.659
I never doubted your intentions.

34:41.830 --> 34:45.375
<i>Must be late for you, Mr.
President. Get some sleep.</i>

34:46.001 --> 34:49.552
Oh, I doubt either of us will
be getting much sleep tonight.

34:49.588 --> 34:53.549
- But thank you for taking my call.
<i>- Well, thank you for calling.</i>

35:02.851 --> 35:06.276
<i>Now, there's only one more
question, and it's a big one.</i>

35:06.312 --> 35:08.148
<i>And you're gonna have
to answer it yourselves.</i>

35:09.482 --> 35:11.943
Who's gonna be the next
President of the United States?

35:19.701 --> 35:22.245
- I know who I'm voting for.
- [chuckles softly]

35:23.288 --> 35:26.839
I'd like to thank everyone who
made the last 24 hours possible.

35:26.875 --> 35:28.966
All the... the technicians and crew.

35:29.002 --> 35:33.512
And if we all work together the
way they have, then I promise,

35:33.548 --> 35:37.725
we will truly make this the
first of many, many new days

35:37.761 --> 35:40.013
for the greatest country in the world.

35:41.890 --> 35:45.936
Good morning, America. God
bless America, and thank you.

35:47.688 --> 35:51.524
- [man] And we're out. Okay, guys.
- [crew applauding]

35:59.908 --> 36:01.242
You did great.

36:01.993 --> 36:03.870
- You did it.
- Yeah.

36:05.121 --> 36:06.915
Everyone is so pleased.

36:13.379 --> 36:16.675
I know it was tough,
but you got through it.

36:21.137 --> 36:23.306
- I'm really proud of you.
- Thank you.

36:27.060 --> 36:29.401
- [clears throat]
- [sighs]

36:29.437 --> 36:32.154
Just some questions
that I needed to answer.

36:32.190 --> 36:36.194
I know. But you did it. You did it.

36:44.995 --> 36:46.961
- Great job. Great.
- [Conway] That was great.

36:46.997 --> 36:48.373
- Amazing.
- Thank you.

36:52.043 --> 36:53.128
[sighs]

36:55.296 --> 36:58.305
[Seth] <i>Testing, testing. One, two, three.</i>

36:58.341 --> 37:01.851
Testing. One, two, three.

37:01.887 --> 37:05.681
Uh, a little more gain.
A skosh more reverb.

37:06.599 --> 37:12.355
Uh, testing, testing, testing.
That's good. That's good. Mmm.

37:13.815 --> 37:18.200
I would like to thank the American people
for their overwhelming support tonight.

37:18.236 --> 37:21.286
As your next president, I do
not take this mandate lightly.

37:21.322 --> 37:25.124
In fact... it is heavy as hell.

37:25.160 --> 37:27.495
You got a better chance
than Underwood does.

37:34.169 --> 37:35.879
Those are very high heels, Bridget.

37:37.839 --> 37:40.216
When Underwood loses,
the committee goes away.

37:41.051 --> 37:42.718
You're breaking my heart.

37:43.594 --> 37:47.312
I was looking forward to hearing what
you had to say about Doug Stamper.

37:47.348 --> 37:48.989
Yeah, I was looking
forward to saying it.

37:50.936 --> 37:52.603
I came here to thank you.

37:53.646 --> 37:57.025
I took it down... off the Internet.

37:59.360 --> 38:02.280
It's weird, talking to
you about this. I mean...

38:03.198 --> 38:05.366
uh, you saw it.

38:07.828 --> 38:11.503
- My brother could've seen that.
- Do I remind you of your brother?

38:11.539 --> 38:12.791
[chuckles]

38:13.708 --> 38:17.843
- He's a little more present.
- Well, it's my job to look ahead.

38:17.879 --> 38:20.799
Hmm. Good luck with that.

38:26.888 --> 38:28.764
[camera shutters clicking]

38:40.485 --> 38:42.952
- Thank you so very much.
- Thank you, sir.

38:42.988 --> 38:43.989
Oh.

38:47.408 --> 38:49.410
[scattered applause]

38:53.957 --> 38:56.548
- [LeAnn] <i>We have the overnight numbers.</i>
- Give me the outliers.

38:56.584 --> 39:00.510
<i>Minus two in New York. Plus two
in New Hampshire. Both not bad.</i>

39:00.546 --> 39:04.098
"Half-empty, half-full" is an
expression I have never cared for.

39:04.134 --> 39:05.933
<i>The call you made last
night, it's helping.</i>

39:05.969 --> 39:07.343
<i>We grabbed the headlines this morning.</i>

39:07.345 --> 39:08.685
- Doug?
- [Doug] <i>Yes, sir.</i>

39:08.721 --> 39:12.314
I want you to reach out to Sally Ann back
in Gaffney and get me the turnout so far.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.231
[LeAnn] <i>I can get you the
numbers for the state.</i>

39:14.685 --> 39:17.903
No, I don't want that. I
want the Gaffney turnout.

39:17.939 --> 39:20.405
State numbers come in, you
give them to us as they come.

39:20.441 --> 39:22.282
Anything out of the
ordinary, you let us know.

39:22.318 --> 39:25.035
Other than that, we're
done. Oh, and, Doug?

39:25.071 --> 39:28.366
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>
- You'll know where to find us.

39:30.201 --> 39:31.494
[beeps]

39:33.579 --> 39:35.706
You're worried about
the crowd we just saw.

39:36.832 --> 39:40.628
Not the size. Their enthusiasm.

39:43.965 --> 39:46.009
- [indistinct chatter]
- [phones ringing]

39:48.678 --> 39:50.221
I don't think so.

39:52.057 --> 39:54.142
Jerry, I'm gonna have to call you back.

39:55.226 --> 39:57.692
This is 9:00 a.m. turnout in
our base precincts or swing?

39:57.728 --> 39:59.236
Base.

39:59.272 --> 40:00.606
Shit.

40:03.526 --> 40:05.068
I've got different numbers.
You're gonna need...

40:05.070 --> 40:07.072
I did confirm. Twice.

40:11.952 --> 40:14.412
Doug, it's me. Call me
as soon as you get this.

40:15.914 --> 40:19.506
<i>You handle just automobile
insurance or all kinds?</i>

40:19.542 --> 40:22.509
<i>All kinds. Fire, earthquake,
theft, public liability.</i>

40:22.545 --> 40:25.637
<i>Group insurance, industrial stuff,
and so on right down the line.</i>

40:25.673 --> 40:26.889
<i>Accident insurance?</i>

40:26.925 --> 40:29.385
<i>Accident insurance?
Sure, Mrs. Dietrichson.</i>

40:31.221 --> 40:32.845
<i>Wish you'd tell me what's
engraved on that anklet.</i>

40:32.847 --> 40:35.183
- [Phyllis] <i>Just my name.</i>
- [Walter] <i>As for instance?</i>

40:35.891 --> 40:39.520
<i>- Phyllis.
- Phyllis, huh? I think I like that.</i>

40:40.105 --> 40:41.486
[Frank] Let's do this one.

40:41.522 --> 40:44.323
I'd drive it around the
block a couple of times.

40:44.359 --> 40:47.867
Mr. Neff, why don't you drop by tomorrow
evening around 8:30? He'll be in then.

40:47.903 --> 40:50.329
- Who?
- My husband.

40:50.365 --> 40:52.115
You were anxious to
talk to him, weren't you?

40:52.117 --> 40:54.208
Yeah, I was. But, uh...

40:54.244 --> 40:56.564
I'm sort of getting over the
idea, if you know what I mean.

40:56.579 --> 40:58.753
There's a speed limit
in this state, Mr. Neff.

40:58.789 --> 41:00.214
Forty-five miles an hour.

41:00.250 --> 41:03.592
- How fast was I going, Officer?
- I'd say around 90.

41:03.628 --> 41:06.011
Suppose you get off that
motorcycle and give me a ticket.

41:06.047 --> 41:08.138
So I'd let you off with
a warning this time.

41:08.174 --> 41:09.932
Suppose it doesn't take.

41:09.968 --> 41:11.768
Suppose I have to whack
you over the knuckles.

41:12.387 --> 41:14.747
Suppose I burst out crying and
put my head on your shoulder.

41:15.431 --> 41:17.591
Suppose you try putting that
on my husband's shoulders.

41:18.643 --> 41:19.810
That tears it.

41:23.481 --> 41:24.947
I'm just not in the mood...

41:24.983 --> 41:27.233
Oh, no. Come on, it's tradition.
If Doug needs us, he'll call.

41:27.235 --> 41:30.202
Yes, but it's different this
time. There's so much going on...

41:30.238 --> 41:31.779
- I know, but call me superstitious.
- We're in here.

41:31.781 --> 41:34.789
But we have done this every
election we have ever won.

41:34.825 --> 41:37.334
- Come on. <i>
- I wonder if I know what you mean.</i>

41:37.370 --> 41:39.289
I wonder if you wonder.

41:43.043 --> 41:44.174
It was a hot afternoon,

41:44.210 --> 41:47.547
and I still remember the smell of
honeysuckle all down that street.

41:48.312 --> 41:49.963
How could I have known that murder...

41:49.965 --> 41:52.766
[both] Can sometimes
smell like honeysuckle?

41:52.802 --> 41:54.135
[Walter] <i>Maybe you would've
known, Keyes,</i>

41:54.137 --> 41:55.761
<i>the minute she mentioned
accident insurance.</i>

41:55.763 --> 41:59.231
- [phone rings]
<i>- But I didn't. I felt like a million.</i>

41:59.267 --> 42:00.482
[Frank] Yes.

42:00.518 --> 42:03.438
[Walter] <i>I went back to the office</i>
<i>to see if I had any mail.</i>

42:04.106 --> 42:06.357
Well, what do you mean they don't match?

42:07.400 --> 42:09.194
In my home state?

42:12.363 --> 42:15.622
Well, you and LeAnn better
get over here right now.

42:15.658 --> 42:17.243
What's the matter?

42:18.453 --> 42:20.494
There's something wrong with
the numbers in the precincts

42:20.496 --> 42:22.921
that we're getting from this
morning. They don't match up.

42:22.957 --> 42:25.543
It's never happened
before in South Carolina.

42:28.921 --> 42:32.764
- Well, you have nothing to say about that?
- Oh, I'm sure the numbers are wrong.

42:32.800 --> 42:34.802
Oh, you don't believe that for a second.

42:36.054 --> 42:38.723
[sighs] I can't win with you.

42:40.933 --> 42:42.477
No matter what I say.

42:43.686 --> 42:46.653
How many times did you walk me home?

42:46.689 --> 42:48.066
What?

42:50.610 --> 42:53.785
Oh, I don't know. Probably a handful.

42:53.821 --> 42:58.868
No, it wasn't a handful.
It was 18... in a month.

43:03.748 --> 43:06.334
- It was on my way home.
- [scoffs]

43:07.585 --> 43:10.219
- And what are you saying?
- Nothing. It was on my way home.

43:10.255 --> 43:11.970
No, it wasn't just on your way home.

43:12.006 --> 43:15.640
We tried to go to the Museum of Fine Arts.
It was closed. It was freezing that day.

43:15.676 --> 43:17.601
- Yeah.
- And this was on in your room.

43:17.637 --> 43:20.723
- It was.
- And I asked you to kiss me.

43:21.349 --> 43:23.773
- I made you kiss me.
- No, you didn't make me kiss you.

43:23.809 --> 43:25.395
I wanted to kiss you.

43:27.397 --> 43:31.734
And anyway, I knew we were gonna
spend the rest of our lives together.

43:32.527 --> 43:34.326
And we are.

43:34.362 --> 43:36.239
No regrets, no matter what.

43:38.073 --> 43:41.083
What does that mean? What do you
mean by that, "no matter what"?

43:41.119 --> 43:43.121
- You think we're gonna lose?
- No!

43:45.415 --> 43:46.416
No.

43:51.171 --> 43:52.672
[Claire sighs]

43:54.132 --> 43:58.475
- Are we together?
- Yes, we're together. No matter what...

43:58.511 --> 44:01.472
No, not "no matter
what." Are we together?

44:03.183 --> 44:05.274
We're together, Francis.

44:05.310 --> 44:08.318
Then don't ever bring up
losing around me again.

44:08.354 --> 44:11.774
<i>- That's the boy.
- Thank you, Mr. Keyes.</i>

44:15.528 --> 44:17.369
<i>What kind of an outfit is this, anyway?</i>

44:17.405 --> 44:19.988
<i>Are we an insurance company or
just a bunch of dim-witted amateurs</i>

44:19.990 --> 44:21.282
<i>to write a policy on a mug like that?</i>

44:21.284 --> 44:22.908
<i>Now, wait a minute, Keyes.
I don't rate this beef.</i>

44:22.910 --> 44:25.294
[LeAnn] The turnout in Philly
is lower than they're saying.

44:25.330 --> 44:28.004
- How much lower?
- 30% in our key precincts.

44:28.040 --> 44:29.923
Thirty? How?

44:29.959 --> 44:31.792
It's not just Pennsylvania.
People aren't voting.

44:31.794 --> 44:32.967
Their people, our people.

44:33.003 --> 44:35.804
Wait. If Conway's got
Pennsylvania, then he's got Ohio.

44:35.840 --> 44:37.889
If he's got Ohio, then we lose.

44:37.925 --> 44:39.641
- How did this happen?
- I'll tell them.

44:39.677 --> 44:41.596
That is one thing you are not doing.

44:45.015 --> 44:46.536
[Walter] <i>That was all there was to it.</i>

44:46.559 --> 44:49.276
<i>Nothing had slipped,
nothing had been overlooked.</i>

44:49.312 --> 44:51.695
<i>There was nothing to give us away.</i>

44:51.731 --> 44:55.324
<i>And yet, Keyes, as I was walking
down the street to the drugstore,</i>

44:55.360 --> 44:58.910
<i>suddenly it came over me that
everything would go wrong.</i>

44:58.946 --> 45:02.038
<i>It sounds crazy, Keyes,
but it's true, so help me.</i>

45:02.074 --> 45:04.285
<i>I couldn't hear my own footsteps.</i>

45:07.997 --> 45:09.915
<i>It was the walk of a dead man.</i>

45:13.669 --> 45:16.094
<i>That was the longest night
I ever lived through, Keyes.</i>

45:16.130 --> 45:18.841
<i>And the next day was worse when
the story broke in the papers.</i>

45:20.009 --> 45:22.058
<i>They started talking
about it at the office.</i>

45:22.094 --> 45:25.229
<i>And the day after that, when
you started digging into it.</i>

45:25.265 --> 45:29.316
<i>I kept my hands in my pockets
because I thought they were shaking.</i>

45:29.352 --> 45:31.735
<i>I put on dark glasses so
people couldn't see my eyes,</i>

45:31.771 --> 45:35.572
<i>then I took them off again so they
wouldn't get to wondering why I wore them.</i>

45:35.608 --> 45:38.700
<i>- I tried to hold myself together but...</i>
- Thank you.

45:38.736 --> 45:41.572
<i>I could feel my nerves
pulling me to pieces.</i>

45:48.078 --> 45:51.505
Get me Sally Ann in the Cherokee
County clerk's office in South Carolina.

45:51.541 --> 45:52.875
I'll hold.

45:55.795 --> 45:59.632
They overestimated the
turnouts in Pennsylvania by 30%.

46:03.177 --> 46:05.394
Hi! Hi, y'all.

46:05.430 --> 46:07.437
Well, now, do not call me "sir."

46:07.473 --> 46:11.065
This is Francis Underwood. We've
known each other too long for that.

46:11.101 --> 46:13.026
[laughs]

46:13.062 --> 46:15.820
So, Sally, how was turnout today?

46:15.856 --> 46:18.943
Well, I was just really actually
looking for Cherokee County.

46:21.487 --> 46:23.781
Yes, I just wanted
to hear it for myself.

46:24.740 --> 46:27.749
Great. Thank you.

46:27.785 --> 46:30.835
And we send our love
to Henry and the boys.

46:30.871 --> 46:32.373
Goodbye.

46:36.377 --> 46:39.547
- It's low.
- What do you mean, "low"?

46:45.094 --> 46:46.471
[Frank] Low.

46:51.434 --> 46:52.643
[door opens]

46:53.936 --> 46:55.187
[door closes]

48:36.371 --> 48:37.873
[carving]

49:03.691 --> 49:07.617
<i>- I was thinking about that anklet.
- And what are you thinking about now?</i>

49:07.653 --> 49:08.946
<i>I'm all through thinking, baby.</i>

49:10.280 --> 49:14.415
<i>- I just came to say goodbye.
- Goodbye? Where are you going?</i>

49:14.451 --> 49:16.960
[Walter] <i>You're the one</i>
<i>that's going, baby. Not me.</i>

49:16.996 --> 49:19.588
<i>I'm getting off the trolley
car right at this corner.</i>

49:19.624 --> 49:22.249
[Phyllis] <i>Suppose you stop being fancy.</i>
<i>Let's have it, whatever it is.</i>

49:22.251 --> 49:26.385
[Walter] <i>All right, I'll tell you.</i>
<i>Friend of mine's got a funny theory...</i>

49:26.421 --> 49:28.423
You know what this means, don't you?

49:29.341 --> 49:31.218
This is our house.

49:32.427 --> 49:34.471
We are not leaving.

49:34.964 --> 49:36.555
[Walter] <i>The last stop's a cemetery.</i>

49:36.557 --> 49:38.976
