00:47.380 --> 00:51.217
One, two, three...

00:51.384 --> 00:53.470
...three, three.

00:53.636 --> 00:54.888
Yo, what comes after three?

00:55.263 --> 00:57.390
Four. Four comes after three.

00:57.557 --> 00:59.559
-I don't hear you counting.
-Four.

01:00.977 --> 01:02.645
Four.

01:02.812 --> 01:05.315
-Five.
-Five.

01:05.482 --> 01:07.984
-Six.
-Six. Faster.

01:08.151 --> 01:10.904
-Seven, eight.
-Sims. Sims!

01:11.071 --> 01:12.489
You're going home.

01:21.206 --> 01:22.832
I'll see you around, sweet mouth.

01:24.167 --> 01:25.835
Inmate on deck.

01:26.503 --> 01:28.713
-He'll be back.
-What's up, baby?

01:28.880 --> 01:30.423
See you around, big man.

01:31.674 --> 01:33.343
Gate open.

01:55.990 --> 01:58.159
Where the hell is this guy?

02:08.169 --> 02:10.380
Cal. Cal.

02:15.343 --> 02:17.720
-What an idiot.
-Let me pop this door for my man.

02:17.887 --> 02:19.889
My main man,
just getting home from prison.

02:22.642 --> 02:26.229
-Percy.
-I'm sorry, Cal.

02:26.396 --> 02:28.064
You stupid?

02:29.732 --> 02:32.652
All right, wait. Hold up.
So they want us to steal a diamond?

02:32.819 --> 02:36.823
-How much your man Walken paying?
-Dig this. A hundred G's.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.950
A hundred G's?

02:39.159 --> 02:41.411
-That's good loot.
-Enough to get my label started.

02:41.953 --> 02:44.789
Let me give you a taste
of my first single.

02:47.250 --> 02:49.002
-It's fire.
-Yeah.

02:50.420 --> 02:51.963
Never been shot before...

02:52.130 --> 02:55.592
...but I've been beat about the skull
and the neck area with a crowbar.

02:55.758 --> 02:57.510
Check the lyrics, check the lyrics.

02:57.969 --> 02:59.721
I'II take you to the butcher shop

03:00.180 --> 03:02.432
Let you Iick a big pork chop

03:02.599 --> 03:04.767
GirI, I know you Iike ham hocks

03:04.934 --> 03:08.229
If you're Jewish, I even got Iox
Hey! Hey!

03:09.105 --> 03:10.440
Yo, camel-mouth.

03:10.607 --> 03:14.235
-That's 50 Cent.
-Cal, that's not 50 Cent.

03:14.402 --> 03:15.695
He talk about candy.

03:16.404 --> 03:18.281
I'm talking about meat.

03:18.448 --> 03:21.117
That's a whole other level. P-Unit.

03:21.284 --> 03:23.453
You better off stuffing your money
in a mattress.

03:23.620 --> 03:26.414
Yeah. I bet you gonna
mess your money up...

03:26.581 --> 03:28.041
...on booze and cheap hookers.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.459
-So?
-What you need to do...

03:29.626 --> 03:32.086
...is just find you a nice girl
and settle down, Cal.

03:32.253 --> 03:34.088
Come on, P,
you know that ain't happening.

03:34.255 --> 03:36.633
I mean, you being all short and all.

03:37.467 --> 03:39.302
Let me tell you something
about love.

03:39.469 --> 03:43.056
I never had it. I don't want it.
I don't need it. All right?

03:44.057 --> 03:46.726
You ain't gotta keep hitting me, Calvin.
I'm not your child.

03:46.893 --> 03:50.813
How am I gonna be a hard-core rapper
if you keep putting your hands on me?

03:50.980 --> 03:56.069
Don't push me
Because I'm cIose to the edge

03:56.236 --> 03:59.113
Check this out. You hang in the back
until Vanessa gets here.

03:59.280 --> 04:00.865
When I give a signal, you come out.

04:01.032 --> 04:02.116
That's cool. I got you.

04:02.283 --> 04:04.953
Hey, Jimmy, please, man.
This is the biggest day of my life.

04:05.119 --> 04:08.414
-It's gotta go off right, okay?
-Baby, what'd I tell you? I got you.

04:08.581 --> 04:10.083
And can I say something?

04:10.250 --> 04:13.002
-Congratulations, man.
-Thank you.

04:13.169 --> 04:16.005
You done stepped up to the plate.
Give me a hug, homeboy.

04:16.172 --> 04:19.341
Oh, man, you done did it,
you know.

04:21.427 --> 04:24.305
Hey, man, you ain't had to do this.

04:25.306 --> 04:26.849
You know, the valet tripping.

04:27.016 --> 04:29.519
-Made me park around the corner.
-Jimmy, get-- Beat it.

04:29.686 --> 04:31.312
-Thank you. Thank you.
-Get on it.

04:35.900 --> 04:38.695
-Hi.
-Hey, beautiful.

04:40.196 --> 04:42.824
So I'm so glad
that you got out of work to be here.

04:43.157 --> 04:47.912
You think I wouldn't take off work?
And miss this? Are you crazy?

04:48.079 --> 04:49.831
Look at you, beautiful.

04:49.998 --> 04:52.875
-You are glowing. My God.
-Thank you.

04:54.168 --> 04:56.045
It feels like it was just yesterday...

04:56.546 --> 04:59.549
...sitting in this same restaurant,
when I asked you to marry me.

05:00.383 --> 05:03.219
I'm still working on that diamond.
I didn't forget the diamond.

05:03.386 --> 05:07.056
I know, baby. You are the sweetest,
most supportive man on the planet.

05:08.766 --> 05:09.809
Can I talk now?

05:09.976 --> 05:11.936
-I'm sorry. Go ahead.
-Okay.

05:12.103 --> 05:14.856
So you know what I've been waiting
all week to find out.

05:15.023 --> 05:16.733
Yes. Yep.

05:16.899 --> 05:19.068
-Well, I got the news...
-Yeah.

05:19.235 --> 05:22.739
-...and I'm--
-Pregnant. Yes! Yes!

05:23.239 --> 05:25.825
-Having my baby
-Oh, no.

05:25.992 --> 05:27.827
-Is so important to me
-No. No, no.

05:27.994 --> 05:29.912
-Darryl. Darryl.
-Baby.

05:30.079 --> 05:33.249
-There's nothing more speciaI
-Darryl-- No, honey, I'm not pregnant.

05:33.416 --> 05:35.251
-I'm not pregnant.
-Than to raise a famiIy

05:35.418 --> 05:37.879
-Excuse me, sir. Sir. Sir.
-I thought that you--

05:38.046 --> 05:39.172
-Hey.
-And--

05:39.339 --> 05:40.798
-Sir.
-Jimmy.

05:41.424 --> 05:43.343
-And--
-Sir!

05:43.926 --> 05:46.012
No. Stop. No.

05:47.096 --> 05:48.348
I'm not pregnant.

05:49.390 --> 05:51.434
-No?
-No.

05:56.731 --> 05:57.732
You're not pregnant?

05:57.899 --> 06:00.777
Baby, but you was nauseous
and throwing up all over the place.

06:00.943 --> 06:02.278
Well, I was very nervous.

06:03.029 --> 06:04.697
Baby, what are we doing here?

06:05.782 --> 06:07.033
Darryl...

06:07.200 --> 06:08.993
...I got the promotion.

06:09.160 --> 06:12.622
And we're movin' on up
To the east side

06:12.789 --> 06:14.040
Jimmy.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.667
They'II be movin' on up
To that apartment in the sky

06:16.834 --> 06:20.755
-I'm gonna hurt him.
-Hey. Hey, Jimmy. Jimmy, stop.

06:20.922 --> 06:23.132
-Man-- Man, you ain't got to do this.
-Hey....

06:23.633 --> 06:25.635
-Okay, then. All right.
-Beat it.

06:28.096 --> 06:30.306
Congratulations.
I'm really proud of you.

06:32.892 --> 06:34.310
But?

06:35.144 --> 06:37.313
But I thought we was gonna
start a family.

06:38.689 --> 06:40.608
We will, baby.

06:41.067 --> 06:44.320
You know, with this promotion,
everything's on track now.

06:44.487 --> 06:48.491
In a couple of years I'll be senior V.P.,
and I can take time off to have a child.

06:48.658 --> 06:50.660
A couple of years?
I don't wanna wait years.

06:50.827 --> 06:53.162
Darryl, you know,
having a baby changes everything.

06:53.579 --> 06:55.373
Hey, I'm willing to do
whatever it takes.

06:55.540 --> 06:57.667
So no more late-night poker
with the guys.

06:58.418 --> 06:59.419
Cool.

07:00.044 --> 07:01.337
No more...

07:01.504 --> 07:03.256
...afternoon quickies.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.925
Stop right there.
We haven't had a afternoon quickie...

07:06.092 --> 07:07.427
...since your father moved in.

07:07.593 --> 07:11.180
That is not fair. My dad is getting old.
Sometimes he forgets things.

07:11.347 --> 07:13.683
I don't feel comfortable
with him living by himself.

07:13.850 --> 07:15.101
What about Whispering Glen?

07:15.268 --> 07:17.854
That place looked like a country club
inside the brochure.

07:18.020 --> 07:19.939
They got Viagra vending machines.

07:20.106 --> 07:21.107
You listen to me.

07:21.274 --> 07:24.861
Until he is a danger to himself
or others, he is staying with us.

07:26.696 --> 07:27.864
Now...

07:28.030 --> 07:29.699
...can we celebrate?

07:29.866 --> 07:34.871
Celebration, come on
We gonna ceIebrate tonight

07:35.037 --> 07:38.291
Come on, come on, let's celebrate
Let's not have a fight

07:38.458 --> 07:40.626
And I'm not taIking tonight

07:40.793 --> 07:42.712
Remix!
Now just you Iadies

07:43.421 --> 07:47.884
Celebrate, celebrate
Celebrate, celebrate

08:00.646 --> 08:02.899
Hey, oblivious.
What are you doing?

08:03.065 --> 08:05.193
Getting ready to rob a jewelry store,
Calvin.

08:05.359 --> 08:06.861
I'm going straight Jesse James.

08:07.028 --> 08:10.239
Percy, put the gun away. Guns
is how you wind up back in prison.

08:10.406 --> 08:14.076
I'm telling you, I ain't going back
to jail. You understand?

08:14.243 --> 08:15.912
Now put the gun away.

08:16.370 --> 08:17.914
Why you gotta keep hitting me, Cal?

08:18.080 --> 08:20.750
Sometimes I gotta slap
some sense into you, Percy.

08:20.917 --> 08:22.001
Come on. Give me a hand.

08:26.214 --> 08:27.673
Now, would you trust the big man?

08:29.091 --> 08:30.593
I got a plan, yo.

08:31.260 --> 08:36.432
Now, this stone is a 3-karat,
G-color diamond.

08:36.599 --> 08:40.394
-VVS2, nearly flawless.
-It's been a pleasure, sir.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.355
Just be cool, Cal. I'm telling you.

08:42.647 --> 08:44.815
Oh, there she go. There's--

08:44.982 --> 08:46.442
Go ahead. Do your thing, Cal.

08:57.161 --> 08:59.622
Pardon me for just a moment.

09:01.791 --> 09:04.043
-Do your thing.
-Yes? May I help you?

09:05.711 --> 09:09.423
Percy. CEO and A&R
of P-Unit Records.

09:09.590 --> 09:11.592
Here to pick up jewelry
for one of my artists.

09:12.051 --> 09:14.095
Well, holler at your girl.

09:15.471 --> 09:16.806
Step this way, Percy P.

09:16.973 --> 09:18.975
I like the way you said
my name just now.

09:19.141 --> 09:20.726
Can I sit down? She's sitting down.

09:20.893 --> 09:23.229
Of course you may.
Would you like some gin and juice?

09:41.664 --> 09:44.166
Well, I'm gonna show you
some shiznit right about now.

09:47.503 --> 09:51.090
Yes. Come to daddy.

10:03.060 --> 10:05.313
Now that's what
I'm talking about, baby.

10:05.479 --> 10:07.607
So, what can I get for you
today, Percy P.?

10:09.525 --> 10:11.485
All of the above.

10:15.364 --> 10:17.783
I'll send one of my assistants
from P-Unit Records...

10:17.950 --> 10:19.201
...to pick everything up.

10:19.368 --> 10:23.372
Just tell him to pull up to my bumper,
and I'll throw that junk in his trunk.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.207
Word?

10:26.375 --> 10:28.419
Let me get up out of here.
I gotta bounce.

10:28.586 --> 10:31.047
I got some people meeting me
down there, and I gotta....

10:31.380 --> 10:33.466
So I'm gonna leave, you know?

10:33.883 --> 10:37.136
-Okay? See you later, all right? Peace.
-Peace.

10:38.929 --> 10:40.473
Be cool. What's going on in there?

10:40.640 --> 10:42.308
Has anyone seen my dog?

10:43.934 --> 10:44.977
Hi, puppy.

10:50.399 --> 10:51.901
He stole my dog.

10:54.320 --> 10:55.321
Holy crap.

10:56.197 --> 10:58.074
The Queen's diamond. It's gone.

10:58.240 --> 11:01.035
Relax. We almost there, man.
We about to be paid, man.

11:01.202 --> 11:03.996
I need the police.
Yes, there's been a robbery.

11:06.332 --> 11:09.418
We did it. Modern-day
Butch Cassidy and Sundance.

11:09.585 --> 11:11.754
Come back here with my dog.

11:12.380 --> 11:14.924
-Get out of here, mutt.
-You just tossed a Chihuahua.

11:15.091 --> 11:17.927
-Come on, let's get out of here.
-Gotcha that. We are gone.

11:18.094 --> 11:19.428
Come on, Percy.

11:22.181 --> 11:24.725
-Oh, man.
-This ain't time to be doing doughnuts.

11:28.104 --> 11:29.397
I can't believe this, man.

11:29.730 --> 11:31.273
Damn it, Percy.

11:31.440 --> 11:34.360
You got a boot on the car,
and you about to get one in your butt.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.445
-She finally got me.
-Who?

11:36.612 --> 11:39.532
Nettie, down at Motor Vehicles.
Said I got her pregnant.

11:39.699 --> 11:42.118
I went to family court.
I had all my receipts.

11:43.119 --> 11:44.245
I'm out.

11:45.287 --> 11:47.957
-Hey, yo, Percy. You forgot something.
-What?

11:48.124 --> 11:49.959
Me!

11:50.876 --> 11:53.879
-Come on!
-Sorry, Cal.

12:01.929 --> 12:03.848
-They went that way.
-What'd he look like?

12:04.014 --> 12:05.599
-Black.
-I got him.

12:05.766 --> 12:07.893
-Dark or light?
-Medium.

12:08.060 --> 12:10.563
Suspect is escaping on foot.
African-American male.

12:10.730 --> 12:13.566
About 5'1 0", not real dark,
more of a mocha-caramel color.

12:23.617 --> 12:25.161
What? You shot?

12:25.369 --> 12:28.289
Sweet bejesus.
My muscle, I think I pulled it.

12:28.456 --> 12:30.249
Quick. In here.

12:33.085 --> 12:35.129
Yo, quick, put me down.
We gotta split up.

12:35.296 --> 12:36.839
Okay.

12:45.181 --> 12:48.434
It's late because of the stress,
not because I'm pregnant.

12:48.601 --> 12:52.104
Please, don't even say words like
"stress." It's not good for the baby.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.815
Darryl, there is no baby.

12:54.982 --> 12:57.109
-Aisle two.
-Well, why didn't you just say that?

13:08.704 --> 13:12.082
-Okay, let's go.
-Okay, fine. Just humor me, okay?

13:12.249 --> 13:13.959
-Okay, let's go.
-Okay.

13:17.880 --> 13:21.842
-Enough.
-Okay, okay.

13:28.182 --> 13:29.809
I got one!

13:35.231 --> 13:38.234
-Come on, man.
-Do not resist. Do not resist.

13:38.400 --> 13:40.319
-I'm not resisting.
-Wilson. Wilson. Wilson.

13:40.486 --> 13:41.904
Come on. It's not our guy.

13:42.071 --> 13:44.323
What? You said African-American.

13:44.615 --> 13:46.909
Yeah, but I said
a mocha-caramel color.

13:47.076 --> 13:49.745
He's like a Starbucks black decaf,
maybe a little cream.

13:50.246 --> 13:52.498
-It's not our guy. Sorry about that.
-Come on, man.

13:52.665 --> 13:55.334
-You sure?
-Yeah. He's okay.

13:58.254 --> 14:00.381
-Wilson!
-Well, he looked mocha to me.

14:02.716 --> 14:05.511
-Thank you.
-What?

14:07.680 --> 14:10.933
He looked real shady. He gonna
do something else, and I'll be waiting.

14:12.726 --> 14:14.270
-You still got the diamond?
-No.

14:14.436 --> 14:16.272
-I had to ditch it.
-Where?

14:17.773 --> 14:19.358
In her bag.

14:19.525 --> 14:20.943
Calvin, now what?

14:21.110 --> 14:22.194
We go get it.

14:25.114 --> 14:26.949
Let's go. Come on.

14:34.456 --> 14:36.375
Follow that car.

14:58.397 --> 14:59.607
Yo, there they are.

14:59.773 --> 15:00.983
-There is no baby.
-There is.

15:01.150 --> 15:03.652
-Honey, there is no baby.
-Well, there will be.

15:04.653 --> 15:06.155
Let's go.

15:11.619 --> 15:12.828
Daddy, we're home.

15:13.162 --> 15:16.749
-There's my baby girl.
-Hi, Daddy.

15:18.667 --> 15:20.753
Who's the best daddy
in the whole, wide world?

15:20.920 --> 15:23.297
-I am.
-I know you can do better than that.

15:23.464 --> 15:25.674
Who's the best daddy
in the whole, wide world?

15:25.841 --> 15:28.636
-I am.
-I can't hear you.

15:28.802 --> 15:30.971
I'm the best daddy
in the whole, wide world!

15:44.026 --> 15:45.444
So, what's the good news?

15:45.611 --> 15:47.029
Dad...

15:47.196 --> 15:48.656
...I got the promotion.

15:49.281 --> 15:53.327
Congratulations. Soon you'll make
enough money to leave that bum.

15:53.494 --> 15:55.204
Oh, Dad, he's not a bum.

15:55.371 --> 15:58.040
No? What kind of man
gives the woman he loves...

15:58.207 --> 15:59.833
...a wedding ring with no diamond?

16:00.000 --> 16:03.170
Hey, as soon as I make enough
money, I'm gonna buy her a diamond.

16:03.337 --> 16:05.714
And I'm going to do the nasty
with Jennifer Lopez...

16:05.881 --> 16:08.801
...while Halle Berry tickle my butt.

16:09.885 --> 16:12.554
You know, for a moment
I thought you were gonna tell me...

16:12.721 --> 16:14.807
...you were gonna let this one
impregnate you.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.726
But I see now, this man
ain't got no bullets in the chamber.

16:17.893 --> 16:19.353
What's that supposed to mean?

16:19.520 --> 16:21.480
You heard me.
You're shooting blanks.

16:21.647 --> 16:24.316
-Cooking with a wet noodle.
-What?

16:24.483 --> 16:26.318
Can't hoist the mainsaiI

16:26.485 --> 16:29.905
My sperm have fallen
and it can't get up.

16:30.072 --> 16:32.074
I'll have you know,
I hit that every night.

16:32.241 --> 16:34.076
Hey, that's my daughter
you talking about.

16:34.243 --> 16:36.996
-Back up, old man.
-Okay, okay. Stop. Stop. Please.

16:37.162 --> 16:38.205
Gentlemen.

16:38.372 --> 16:43.293
Dad, we are going to have a baby
when the time is right.

16:44.086 --> 16:46.296
Play nice.

16:53.637 --> 16:54.847
It's still in the bag.

16:55.931 --> 16:58.809
Still in the bag.
Let's go get the rock.

16:58.976 --> 17:02.563
Yo, Percy, how many times
I gotta tell you? No guns.

17:02.730 --> 17:03.731
What we gonna do?

17:03.897 --> 17:06.858
Walken is gonna kill us
if we don't give him the diamond.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.069
Then I guess we gotta find
a way to sneak in.

17:13.281 --> 17:16.035
Well, they did say
they wanted a baby.

17:16.952 --> 17:19.329
No. No.

17:19.496 --> 17:22.249
No. I ain't dressing up like no baby.

17:23.291 --> 17:26.127
Keep still, Cal. You heavy.
You gonna make me drop you.

17:26.295 --> 17:28.797
You drop me
and I'm gonna drop you.

17:28.964 --> 17:30.632
Now, look, you stay close.

17:30.799 --> 17:33.427
I'm gonna go in, I'm gonna
get the diamond, and I'm out.

17:33.594 --> 17:37.890
If you don't mind me saying, Cal,
you make a cute little baby.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.141
I'm out.

17:39.308 --> 17:41.560
You couldn't find
nothing better than a dog basket?

17:41.727 --> 17:45.147
You just be cool. I told you,
this gonna be great, Cal.

17:49.151 --> 17:50.986
Just hold tight.
Everything gonna be fine.

17:51.153 --> 17:53.322
I'm gonna be over here
in the bushes.

18:02.206 --> 18:03.499
Move, dog.

18:03.665 --> 18:05.667
Get out of here.
I'll make a coat out of you.

18:05.834 --> 18:08.170
Get out of here
before I feed you some chocolate.

18:08.837 --> 18:11.340
Get out of here, you fleabag.

18:11.507 --> 18:13.175
-Go.
-Get out of here.

18:13.342 --> 18:15.344
Wait, hold--
Wait. Muttley, wait. No, no.

18:31.193 --> 18:32.611
Honey.

18:32.778 --> 18:34.530
-Yeah?
-Come here.

18:34.863 --> 18:36.698
-What is it, Darryl?
-Look.

18:39.618 --> 18:41.370
Oh, my God.

18:41.537 --> 18:43.038
It's a baby.

18:44.998 --> 18:47.042
I know. And here's a note too.

18:47.376 --> 18:49.545
"Plez luk tafter Kalvin.

18:49.711 --> 18:53.215
We wuzn't abele to keap em."

18:53.382 --> 18:55.342
Poor guy.
His parents must've been retarded.

18:56.218 --> 18:57.803
Well, let's get him inside.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.347
-It's cold out here.
-Okay, okay. All right.

19:00.514 --> 19:01.723
Come on, little guy.

19:01.890 --> 19:03.725
-Yes.
-I got you.

19:06.562 --> 19:08.147
Oh, damn.

19:08.689 --> 19:10.816
-What in the hell is that?
-I don't know.

19:12.234 --> 19:13.652
Man.

19:14.069 --> 19:16.321
Dad, we found a baby
on the doorstep.

19:16.488 --> 19:19.199
-What? What is it? A boy or girl?
-Dada.

19:19.449 --> 19:20.826
I think it's a boy.

19:20.993 --> 19:23.162
Well, whatever it is,
it smell like piss.

19:24.288 --> 19:26.999
Yeah. I think Janet may have left
diapers here. Let's look.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.251
Doesn't your dad have some
diapers upstairs?

19:29.418 --> 19:32.004
I heard that. I don't wear diapers.
Who you talking about?

19:32.588 --> 19:34.089
Haven't worn a diaper in years.

19:34.256 --> 19:36.258
I think she put them in here.

19:43.640 --> 19:45.225
What is it?

19:47.102 --> 19:49.271
That ain't no baby.
That's a porn star.

19:50.063 --> 19:53.025
What on girth is that?

19:53.859 --> 19:56.236
I'm gonna call Child Services.

19:56.403 --> 19:57.446
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Do that.

20:03.869 --> 20:04.953
Directory assistance.

20:05.120 --> 20:07.956
Yes, can I have the number
for Child Services, please?

20:08.123 --> 20:09.791
Connecting you.

20:10.626 --> 20:13.295
ChiId Services is now cIosed
for the weekend.

20:13.462 --> 20:17.007
We wiII re-open at 9 a.m.
Monday morning.

20:21.136 --> 20:22.554
They're closed for the weekend.

20:22.721 --> 20:25.474
The office doesn't open
until 9:00 on Monday morning.

20:26.308 --> 20:27.434
So, what do we do now?

20:27.851 --> 20:31.230
I say, toss this creature back in
the Black Lagoon where it came from.

20:31.396 --> 20:32.564
Daddy, stop it.

20:33.315 --> 20:35.484
Maybe we should call the police.

20:46.995 --> 20:50.332
-That doesn't sound good.
-No, we should take him to the doctor.

20:50.499 --> 20:53.335
Get him checked out.
Who knows what he's been through?

20:53.502 --> 20:54.962
-Okay?
-I'll go get the car keys.

20:55.128 --> 20:56.129
-All right.
-Okay.

20:56.964 --> 20:59.841
Now, when you get to the hospital,
don't stop. Don't stop.

21:00.008 --> 21:02.469
Toss that monster out the window
and keep moving.

21:02.636 --> 21:05.681
Hit the accelerator. I don't wanna
see that little ugly thing again.

21:07.140 --> 21:09.184
Stinky little thing.

21:09.935 --> 21:11.353
Was it a little cough?

21:11.520 --> 21:12.521
-No.
-No.

21:12.688 --> 21:16.149
No, this was like a grown-man,
smoker's cough.

21:17.025 --> 21:19.319
Well, it's probably nothing.

21:19.486 --> 21:21.989
Come on, let's get his shirt off.

21:24.366 --> 21:27.494
He's a strong little fella.

21:31.540 --> 21:34.167
Oh, my God. What is that scar?

21:34.751 --> 21:36.295
From the look of it, I'd say...

21:36.461 --> 21:38.880
...this little guy has had
his appendix removed.

21:39.047 --> 21:40.882
Or he was
in one hell of a knife fight.

21:44.303 --> 21:45.929
What kind of person
tattoos a child?

21:46.096 --> 21:47.597
Oh, you'd be amazed. Come on.

21:48.598 --> 21:50.726
Open up. Open up and say:

21:50.892 --> 21:52.728
Come on. Come on. Come on.

21:57.065 --> 21:59.735
-Wha--? What is it?
-I've never seen a...

21:59.901 --> 22:01.153
...baby with bridgework.

22:02.237 --> 22:05.407
This child has the mouth
of a 40-year-old man.

22:05.866 --> 22:10.287
I can't tell whether these teeth
are coming in or falling out.

22:10.454 --> 22:12.080
Well, he's gonna be okay?

22:12.539 --> 22:13.832
He's fine.

22:13.999 --> 22:18.295
His tonsils are a little swollen
and he might have a bit of a cold.

22:18.462 --> 22:19.463
As a precaution...

22:19.629 --> 22:22.424
...you should take his temperature
before you put him to bed.

22:22.591 --> 22:24.551
-All right. Thank you, Dr. Murphy.
-Okay.

22:24.718 --> 22:27.262
-Thank you very much.
-Bye.

22:28.096 --> 22:30.599
This is just-- It's horrible.
Look at this child.

22:30.766 --> 22:32.642
Let's turn him over
to the authorities.

22:32.809 --> 22:34.936
They can find his parents
and prosecute them.

22:35.103 --> 22:36.605
Are you crazy? We can't do that.

22:36.772 --> 22:38.523
This kid's been through the wringer.

22:38.690 --> 22:41.026
Besides, his birth parents
are probably crackheads.

22:41.193 --> 22:43.111
They're just gonna
put them in rehab.

22:43.278 --> 22:46.281
Then they'll be back on the street,
selling him for a bag of rocks.

22:46.948 --> 22:49.159
What are you saying?

22:49.326 --> 22:51.578
I'm saying,
why don't we just keep him?

22:51.953 --> 22:53.705
-Just until Monday.
-No. No, Darryl.

22:53.872 --> 22:55.082
-Just until--
-He's a child.

22:55.248 --> 22:57.793
-I don't know what to do with a child.
-Just until Monday.

22:57.959 --> 22:59.836
And then we'll take him
to Child Services.

23:00.003 --> 23:02.172
They'll find a home for him.

23:02.339 --> 23:05.425
Besides, who could take
better care of this child than us?

23:08.387 --> 23:11.640
-Where is he?
-Oh, man.

23:17.479 --> 23:19.815
Where do you think you're going?

23:20.774 --> 23:22.025
Well, what do we got here?

23:23.485 --> 23:25.237
-Is this your baby?
-Yes, thank you.

23:26.279 --> 23:28.657
Well, actually...

23:28.824 --> 23:31.493
-...we found him--
-Mama.

23:36.623 --> 23:38.250
He called me Mama.

23:39.668 --> 23:40.669
There you go.

23:43.922 --> 23:46.591
Thank you, officer. Thank you.

23:47.843 --> 23:50.679
You know, Percy,
I don't like having to look for people.

23:52.097 --> 23:54.141
Who, me? I wasn't hiding, Mr. W.

23:54.307 --> 23:55.642
Not Percy. Not the Kid.

23:55.809 --> 23:57.769
I was gonna come
soon as I got the diamond.

23:58.186 --> 23:59.688
So you don't have
my diamond, huh?

23:59.855 --> 24:01.314
No. I mean, I do.

24:01.481 --> 24:03.358
I don't have it on me now,
but it's safe.

24:03.525 --> 24:06.611
We got everything on lockdown.
Believe me. Trust me.

24:06.778 --> 24:09.030
You trying to hustle me, Percy?

24:09.531 --> 24:12.534
Hustle a hustler?
Ain't nothing happening, Mr. W.

24:12.909 --> 24:15.745
It's just that the robbery didn't go
as smooth as we wanted to.

24:15.912 --> 24:19.082
And a situation had popped up,
so we had to split.

24:19.249 --> 24:22.335
-But my partner, he--
-Your partner is not my problem.

24:22.502 --> 24:24.963
My problem is
I don't have my diamond.

24:25.380 --> 24:27.382
Now, I'm gonna give you 24 hours.

24:27.549 --> 24:30.802
After that, my problem becomes
Bruno and Rosco's problem.

24:32.053 --> 24:33.388
And they...

24:33.555 --> 24:35.140
...become your problem.

24:35.307 --> 24:36.683
You got a problem with that?

24:37.058 --> 24:39.269
Ain't got no problem with that, Mr. W.

24:39.436 --> 24:41.354
I got it all under control, I swear.

24:41.521 --> 24:43.690
Don't want a smudge on it,
not a speck, nothing.

24:43.857 --> 24:45.901
Not a smudge.

24:46.318 --> 24:47.569
Okay, Mr. W.

24:48.570 --> 24:49.988
Get him out of here.

24:50.155 --> 24:52.115
-Get him out of here.
-Come on.

24:58.246 --> 25:00.248
Ain't nothing better
than the evening news...

25:00.415 --> 25:02.959
...and my favorite, milk and cookies.

25:03.710 --> 25:05.879
Damn, I forgot my milk.

25:06.046 --> 25:08.256
Jeez, man,
you can't be popping up like that.

25:08.757 --> 25:10.509
For a moment
I thought you were Chucky.

25:11.051 --> 25:12.719
About to put you in a chokehold.

25:14.721 --> 25:16.306
What are you looking at?

25:17.224 --> 25:21.019
A man who exposed himseIf to
poIice officers in a doughnut shop...

25:21.186 --> 25:23.563
...cIaimed that voices
made him do it.

25:23.730 --> 25:26.608
Oh, honey, look how
comfortable he is with us.

25:26.775 --> 25:28.777
He is so cute.

25:28.944 --> 25:30.529
Oh, no, you don't.

25:30.695 --> 25:33.532
No, you don't. No, no, no.

25:33.698 --> 25:35.575
-Dad.
-Come on, Pop, let him sit there.

25:35.742 --> 25:39.120
-Let him have a cookie.
-This is my throne, my sanctuary.

25:39.287 --> 25:41.289
This is my air, my end zone.

25:41.456 --> 25:44.543
-It's just a cookie.
-Oh, it start with the cookie.

25:46.962 --> 25:50.966
Then they want to come to dinner.
Then they want to move in.

25:51.550 --> 25:55.303
Next thing you know,
they're married to your daughter.

25:55.887 --> 25:59.307
-Why he got to bring it back here--
-Already made that mistake once.

25:59.474 --> 26:00.725
-Come on, now.
-Honey.

26:00.892 --> 26:02.769
No more, my brother.

26:02.936 --> 26:06.147
Nobody makes a fool out of me.
I'm from Detroit.

26:08.108 --> 26:09.651
-Everybody's here.
-I can't wait...

26:09.818 --> 26:11.778
...for everybody to meet little Calvin.

26:12.571 --> 26:14.155
-I'm so excited.
-Yeah, yeah.

26:14.322 --> 26:17.951
Introduce him to everybody else, and
go over to somebody else's house.

26:21.997 --> 26:23.582
Cookie got a little bite to it.

26:24.541 --> 26:27.002
-Hi. Come in, come in, come in.
-Hello, hello, hello.

26:27.168 --> 26:30.797
-Hello, hello.
-I'm so excited.

26:30.964 --> 26:32.173
-Hey.
-Hello.

26:32.340 --> 26:36.386
-Consuela, welcome. Come in.
-So where is the little one?

26:37.345 --> 26:42.350
-Here's Calvin.
-Here's Calvin.

26:45.437 --> 26:47.856
-What a mess.
-Honey, that's not nice.

26:48.023 --> 26:49.983
He's scary.

26:50.817 --> 26:52.861
Yeah, well, I mean....

26:53.862 --> 26:58.783
-I mean, lucky he's not yours, right?
-Yeah.

27:00.452 --> 27:03.622
I just think he is precious.
I think he is a precious gift from God.

27:04.205 --> 27:05.540
You know, God gives gifts.

27:05.707 --> 27:10.128
Sometimes he wraps them in a hurry.
Sometimes. Isn't he a precious gift?

27:10.712 --> 27:13.632
Oh, yeah. He's adorable...

27:14.215 --> 27:17.052
...in a NationaI Geographic
sort of way.

27:18.720 --> 27:20.513
What is he, a pygmy?

27:24.976 --> 27:27.228
Consuela, why don't you take
the kids to go play?

27:27.395 --> 27:28.688
Yes, good idea.
Come on, guys.

27:28.855 --> 27:31.483
Tommy, show Nicholas
that scissor-lock thing...

27:31.650 --> 27:33.151
...we've been working on, huh?

27:35.278 --> 27:38.948
Hey, little man.
No hard feelings, right?

27:41.993 --> 27:43.328
Give me five.

27:50.001 --> 27:52.379
Hey, guess what, Calvin?
We brought you some stuff.

27:52.545 --> 27:55.090
We got you some stuff.
We got a box full of bottles, bibs.

27:55.256 --> 27:58.468
Oh, and all of the Dinosaurus Rex
tapes you could possibly want.

27:58.635 --> 28:00.428
Well, thank you. That's a lot of stuff.

28:00.595 --> 28:04.599
He is so cute. I got your nose.

28:04.766 --> 28:07.936
Yes, I do. Yes, I do.

28:10.271 --> 28:11.898
Oh, you got my nose.

28:12.065 --> 28:15.276
You got my nose. Yes, you do.

28:16.611 --> 28:19.406
He's got my nose. He's got my nose.
He's hurting--

28:19.572 --> 28:20.949
Darryl, he's hurting me.

28:21.116 --> 28:23.618
-He's hurting me.
-Okay, okay, okay.

28:23.785 --> 28:25.620
Wow, is he strong.

28:26.246 --> 28:28.707
Yeah, tell me about it.
I still can't feel my hand.

28:28.873 --> 28:31.334
Okay, Darryl, I think you should
take the crib upstairs.

28:31.501 --> 28:33.795
-Yes.
-Ladies, will you help with this stuff?

28:33.962 --> 28:35.213
Okay.

28:35.380 --> 28:37.465
-Guys, help me grab this.
-I'll get this box.

28:37.632 --> 28:39.801
Let's go into the kitchen.
Come, Calvin.

28:39.968 --> 28:42.846
-Come on, baby.
-Come on, little pumpkin-butt.

28:44.013 --> 28:46.141
Janet, this fits perfectly.

28:46.641 --> 28:48.017
-Thank you.
-Let me see.

28:48.768 --> 28:50.562
I'm glad I kept it.

28:51.146 --> 28:53.940
Can't remember the last time
I could wear horizontal stripes.

28:54.899 --> 28:57.819
But, you know, here I go again.
How about you, woman of the hour?

28:57.986 --> 29:00.822
-Congratulations on the promotion.
-Oh, thank you.

29:00.989 --> 29:03.324
It's awesome.
Was Darryl so excited or what?

29:03.491 --> 29:07.662
No, actually. He was disappointed.

29:07.829 --> 29:10.081
Baby up-up.

29:12.500 --> 29:15.503
He thought I was going to tell him
I was pregnant.

29:20.175 --> 29:22.177
Okay, right.

29:22.343 --> 29:24.095
Little Ms. Corporate-Climber
pregnant?

29:24.262 --> 29:29.559
What? You guys.
I want to have a baby at some point.

29:29.726 --> 29:33.438
You could schedule one between
a conference call and a client meeting.

29:34.856 --> 29:38.526
Okay, you know, Darryl is the one
that I'm really worried about.

29:38.693 --> 29:41.112
Are you kidding me?
You're lucky he wants one at all.

29:41.279 --> 29:43.198
I had to promise Greg
I'd give him these.

29:45.283 --> 29:48.703
Okay, now. Okay, easy, fella.

29:50.997 --> 29:55.376
This one's real grabby.
He must have been breast-fed.

29:55.960 --> 29:57.837
Is the baby hungry?

29:58.296 --> 29:59.380
He should be nursed.

29:59.547 --> 30:01.549
Baby like nursey-nursey.

30:02.175 --> 30:04.469
Well, are you sure
you should do that?

30:04.636 --> 30:07.263
Yeah. You don't have to be
the birth mother to breast-feed.

30:08.056 --> 30:11.559
-Nursey-nursey?
-You want to nursey?

30:13.978 --> 30:15.396
Okay.

30:19.484 --> 30:20.860
All right.

30:21.569 --> 30:25.323
-Drink up, precious.
-This one's real wriggly, huh?

30:25.490 --> 30:28.576
Come on. Come on, now. Suck it.

30:28.743 --> 30:33.540
Latch-- Oh, that is not okay.

30:35.416 --> 30:36.709
Let's get these kids home.

30:36.876 --> 30:39.587
I have to take Nicholas and Chrissy
to Mommy and Me tomorrow.

30:39.754 --> 30:41.047
Oh, have fun.

30:41.214 --> 30:44.300
Don't worry about the nose.
He's adorable.

30:44.467 --> 30:47.303
-Thanks for all the stuff.
-Call if you need anything.

30:47.470 --> 30:48.930
-Bye, good night.
-Good night.

30:49.097 --> 30:51.850
If you change your mind
about Consuela, you can take her.

30:52.016 --> 30:54.102
-Oh, thanks.
-I've got, like, all the chores.

30:54.269 --> 30:55.937
One for you...

30:57.272 --> 30:59.274
...and one for the baby.

31:17.876 --> 31:19.669
He's a little charmer, isn't he?

31:19.878 --> 31:22.130
Call me.

31:24.299 --> 31:26.801
I could have sworn he just
stuck his tongue in my mouth.

31:34.976 --> 31:37.312
-Well, I-- That was-- I thought--
-That went well.

31:37.478 --> 31:39.647
-Yeah.
-I thought they thought he was cute.

31:39.814 --> 31:42.358
Great. You're wonder--
Oh, Calvin, you did so good.

31:42.525 --> 31:44.611
-Come on. Yeah.
-You did so well.

31:44.777 --> 31:47.697
If that lady touches you in a way
that makes you uncomfortable...

31:47.864 --> 31:49.365
...you let us know, okay?

31:49.532 --> 31:51.117
-Yeah. You're the charmer.
-Yeah.

31:51.993 --> 31:56.164
Does that warm water feel good?
Does it feel nice?

31:56.331 --> 31:58.499
Yeah. Look at you.

31:58.666 --> 32:02.337
Do you want some company in there
with you?

32:02.503 --> 32:03.796
I think we can work that out.

32:04.339 --> 32:07.050
Yeah? Yeah?

32:07.216 --> 32:08.593
Hey, Darryl?

32:08.760 --> 32:11.846
Hello. It's bath time.

32:14.641 --> 32:16.684
Come on, let's get clean.

32:17.644 --> 32:20.563
We gonna clean your little butt-butt.
Yes, we are.

32:20.730 --> 32:22.565
And then we gonna play
Snatch the Marbles.

32:22.732 --> 32:24.192
We're gonna fart in the tub...

32:24.359 --> 32:27.487
...and make our own
little Jacuzzi bubbles.

32:32.659 --> 32:36.037
Oh, the little baby.
Yes, you're so clean now.

32:36.204 --> 32:37.664
You're so nice and clean.

32:42.418 --> 32:45.296
Hey. Okay-- Calvin.

32:45.463 --> 32:47.715
Okay, Calvin.

32:48.925 --> 32:50.385
Okay. Hey, Darryl?

32:50.551 --> 32:53.721
-All right, sweetie.
-Hello, little boy.

32:53.888 --> 32:55.556
Hi, cutie.

32:55.723 --> 32:57.934
Now it's time to get you
all dressed for bed, huh?

32:58.101 --> 33:00.895
Don't forget the doctor said
we need to take his temperature.

33:01.062 --> 33:02.605
Okay.

33:02.814 --> 33:04.065
-Yeah.
-All right.

33:04.232 --> 33:05.692
Open up wide.

33:05.858 --> 33:08.736
-Darryl, what are you doing?
-I'm taking his temperature.

33:08.903 --> 33:12.407
Sweetie, he's a baby,
so that's a rectal thermometer.

33:13.950 --> 33:15.243
Yeah. Go ahead.

33:15.410 --> 33:16.661
-You're such a--
-Okay, baby.

33:16.828 --> 33:18.871
All right. Here we go. There we--

33:20.081 --> 33:21.833
-Oh, shit.
-Darryl, what are you doing?

33:22.208 --> 33:24.919
Darryl, come on. Darryl, just--

33:25.086 --> 33:27.380
-I'm trying to--
-Honey.

33:27.547 --> 33:29.424
It's okay, Calvin. It's okay.

33:29.590 --> 33:31.884
-If he'll just roll over here.
-Okay, good, good.

33:32.051 --> 33:33.761
-I could get him down like--
-No, no.

33:33.928 --> 33:37.265
-Wait, be gentle. Calvin, it's okay.
-He's a little strong.

33:37.432 --> 33:40.601
Okay, all right.
Nobody likes this, I know.

33:40.768 --> 33:43.271
I know, nobody-- Nobody likes this.

33:43.438 --> 33:47.442
It's okay. It's okay.
Oh, yeah. There we go, son.

33:47.608 --> 33:51.320
-Here comes the choo-choo train.
-You're okay, baby. Oh, yeah.

33:57.035 --> 34:01.539
It's in the tunnel, son.
It's almost at your stop.

34:06.169 --> 34:08.337
There you go, little man.

34:08.713 --> 34:12.507
Now, this is gonna put you to sleep.

34:13.467 --> 34:15.094
All right, little buddy.

34:21.559 --> 34:23.311
Good night, baby.

34:29.900 --> 34:32.820
Like this thing's gonna
put somebody to sleep.

34:33.446 --> 34:35.406
I'm gonna wait for you
to go to sleep.

34:35.572 --> 34:38.034
I'm gonna get my diamond
and be out.

36:07.999 --> 36:12.003
Come on, baby, be in here.
Come on.

36:13.588 --> 36:14.881
Come on.

36:15.047 --> 36:17.091
Come on, where you at?
Where you at?

36:17.258 --> 36:18.843
There we go.

36:20.303 --> 36:24.724
Hi, beautiful. Yes.

36:40.281 --> 36:42.950
Man, this idiot better
pick up the phone.

36:57.506 --> 36:59.926
People calling here all kind of time.

37:00.092 --> 37:03.930
Like people don't live here. I mean,
you can't be calling nobody house....

37:04.722 --> 37:08.809
P-Unit Productions, in association
with Go Get a Girl Entertainment.

37:08.976 --> 37:11.312
-Hey, yo, Percy. It's me.
-CaIvin?

37:11.479 --> 37:14.440
-What's going on?
-I need you to come pick me up.

37:14.607 --> 37:17.485
-Now, look, I got the dia--
-Reach for the sky.

37:18.986 --> 37:20.655
Who you talking to, sonny boy?

37:25.826 --> 37:28.496
Oh, don't give me that old...crap.

37:28.663 --> 37:29.997
Hand me that damn phone.

37:31.290 --> 37:33.042
-Who is this?
-Me no speak no English.

37:33.209 --> 37:34.502
Wrong number. Sorry.

37:34.669 --> 37:37.338
Who the hell's "No speak the English"?
Who the hell is this?

37:37.505 --> 37:39.257
-Say something.
-What are you doing?

37:39.423 --> 37:41.717
I heard some noises,
came downstairs...

37:41.884 --> 37:43.970
...and caught this little hoodlum
on the phone.

37:44.136 --> 37:46.681
-Must've looked for the safe.
-We don't have a safe.

37:46.847 --> 37:49.600
-He didn't know that.
-Dada.

37:50.601 --> 37:54.522
Pop, man. He's a baby.

37:54.689 --> 37:57.525
It's his first night in a new house.
Probably couldn't sleep.

37:57.692 --> 38:01.779
Look at you. You look crazy, man.
Holding a shotgun, wearing red socks.

38:01.946 --> 38:05.074
You look like Fred Sanford on crack.
Put that away, man. Go to bed.

38:05.241 --> 38:07.493
Oh, you are good.

38:07.660 --> 38:09.537
You are real good.

38:09.704 --> 38:11.872
I'm gonna keep my eye on you.

38:12.331 --> 38:13.874
You gonna give me the finger?

38:14.041 --> 38:17.503
Where did you learn that, huh?
BET videos After Dark?

38:20.381 --> 38:21.632
Him scary.

38:21.799 --> 38:23.509
There we go.

38:23.676 --> 38:26.846
Don't pay him any mind.
He just a old, crazy man.

38:27.013 --> 38:30.558
I know just what to fix you
so you can have a good night's sleep.

38:44.613 --> 38:47.575
Go. Boy, you must have
had a rough first night.

38:49.035 --> 38:51.078
That's because I'm new
at this dad stuff.

38:51.245 --> 38:53.914
Give me a minute,
I'll get it together.

38:57.668 --> 39:01.088
Man, can't imagine
what kind of life you must have had.

39:01.922 --> 39:03.132
I'll tell you this:

39:03.299 --> 39:05.885
This weekend is gonna be
the best weekend of your life.

39:06.052 --> 39:07.261
You know why?

39:07.428 --> 39:10.348
Because I'm gonna show you
how great it is to have a dad...

39:10.514 --> 39:14.226
...and you're gonna show me
how great it is to be a dad.

39:15.311 --> 39:18.272
Vanessa don't think I can do it,
but I know I got it in me.

39:18.439 --> 39:21.275
You know why? Because
I would never abandon my child.

39:22.902 --> 39:26.113
Ever. I'll always be there for him.

39:26.489 --> 39:29.492
And there'll never be a time
when my son can't come to me...

39:29.658 --> 39:32.036
...and talk to me
about anything in the world...

39:32.203 --> 39:36.123
...over a nice, warm cup of milk.

39:45.800 --> 39:48.469
What's so funny?
What are you all giggly for?

39:49.220 --> 39:51.263
You're drinking Janet's breast milk.

39:54.392 --> 39:58.771
Baby, you did the right thing,
letting him stay with us this weekend.

39:59.230 --> 40:01.065
Thank you.

40:02.650 --> 40:07.488
But you know, I still can't wait for us
to have one of our own.

40:08.906 --> 40:12.576
-Yes, I know.
-All right.

40:13.661 --> 40:16.455
You wanna know the nice thing
about you not being pregnant?

40:16.956 --> 40:18.499
What?

40:18.749 --> 40:20.835
We get to keep trying.

40:31.137 --> 40:34.181
Honey? What about the baby?

40:34.348 --> 40:37.184
He's asleep, don't worry about him.
You've got me.

40:37.351 --> 40:39.145
But, honey...

40:41.105 --> 40:42.857
...he's watching.

40:45.818 --> 40:48.946
He's too young to know
what's going on. Forget him.

40:52.533 --> 40:53.909
Okay.

40:55.286 --> 40:56.996
Okay.

41:11.510 --> 41:13.053
Good morning.

41:14.763 --> 41:17.683
More like, great morning.

41:17.850 --> 41:21.228
Looks like someone had a really good
night's sleep last night.

41:22.229 --> 41:23.856
Who could sleep?

41:24.023 --> 41:27.193
-You were an animal last night.
-Oh, well, you know--

41:27.359 --> 41:31.155
I don't remember the last time
we did it twice in one night.

41:31.322 --> 41:32.781
Twice?

41:35.409 --> 41:36.869
Hey, when did he get in the bed?

41:38.579 --> 41:41.916
I don't know. I don't know
how he gets out of that crib.

41:42.082 --> 41:43.751
He's such a crafty little fella.

41:47.838 --> 41:50.007
You want some breakfast?

41:50.174 --> 41:51.592
Some more ass.

41:54.136 --> 41:55.513
Twice?

42:14.114 --> 42:17.243
-How's my baby girl this morning?
-So good, Dad.

42:17.409 --> 42:19.787
-How are you?
-Mighty fine, thank you.

42:19.954 --> 42:21.455
No, no, no.

42:21.622 --> 42:23.958
Thanks very much, Jim.
And in other news...

42:24.124 --> 42:27.086
...poIice have a suspect
in yesterday's daring diamond heist.

42:27.253 --> 42:29.922
It is this man,
CaIvin "Baby Face" Sims...

42:30.089 --> 42:32.299
-...who was reIeased--
-D. Rex, D. Rex, D. Rex.

42:32.466 --> 42:34.301
Stop that,
whatever you're talking about.

42:34.468 --> 42:37.263
D. Rex, D. Rex, D. Rex.

42:37.429 --> 42:38.639
Just be quiet.

42:39.014 --> 42:40.641
-D. Rex.
-Baby Face--

42:40.933 --> 42:43.978
Dad, let Calvin watch his show.

42:44.353 --> 42:47.773
You have to be the adult.
Let Calvin watch his tape.

42:47.940 --> 42:50.818
-I wanna watch the news.
-I don't care what you wanna watch.

42:50.985 --> 42:53.612
He was watching the TV first.

42:53.779 --> 42:55.239
I'll read the news.

42:55.406 --> 42:59.827
I tell you, the world is going to hell
in a handcart.

43:36.071 --> 43:39.033
Wow, Dad,
you really cleaned your plate.

43:39.199 --> 43:41.493
What?
That hobgoblin ate my breakfast.

43:42.536 --> 43:44.538
Oh, Daddy, don't be ridiculous.

43:44.705 --> 43:47.875
I ain't being ridiculous.
That little sucker ate my breakfast.

43:48.042 --> 43:51.545
I'm going to the diner, where I can eat
and watch the news in peace.

43:51.837 --> 43:55.341
Okay, Dad. Be careful.

43:55.507 --> 43:59.345
Why don't we get you some food?
You must be so hungry.

43:59.511 --> 44:01.972
It's time for you to eat something.

44:03.015 --> 44:05.517
-Morning, sweetie.
-Oh, good morning, baby.

44:05.684 --> 44:06.977
Hello.

44:07.144 --> 44:10.147
-I have your breakfast right here.
-Oh, goodie.

44:11.732 --> 44:15.402
Oh, sweetie, okay,
now your dad is really tripping.

44:15.861 --> 44:19.365
Last night, I caught him
holding little Calvin at gunpoint...

44:19.531 --> 44:22.034
...because he heard him
talking on the phone.

44:22.284 --> 44:24.078
That is-- That's crazy.

44:24.411 --> 44:27.039
Well, you know...

44:27.206 --> 44:32.252
...just now he ate all of his breakfast,
and then he told me the baby ate it.

44:33.420 --> 44:36.340
-Can you say, "Whispering Glen"?
-No, Darryl.

44:36.507 --> 44:37.925
No nursing homes, okay?

44:38.092 --> 44:40.511
I don't wanna have this conversation
with you again.

44:40.678 --> 44:43.389
I have to go to work,
but the baby's food is here.

44:43.555 --> 44:45.683
-And I love you.
-I love you too.

44:45.849 --> 44:49.228
Have a good day. Kiss. Feed him.

44:50.229 --> 44:51.939
All right.

44:54.191 --> 44:57.486
Okay, okay, let's get you all fed.

44:57.653 --> 45:02.783
All right. Open up wide.
Here come the airplane.

45:08.789 --> 45:10.582
Oh, I see.

45:10.749 --> 45:12.918
You want to play a game
of peekaboo, huh?

45:13.085 --> 45:15.087
Okay, okay, okay.

45:15.254 --> 45:16.880
Peekaboo, I see you.

45:20.134 --> 45:22.386
Peekaboo, I see you.

45:38.318 --> 45:41.488
You gotta be kidding me. God.

45:48.662 --> 45:50.247
Darryl?

45:51.498 --> 45:53.167
Where did I put it?

45:59.673 --> 46:01.842
Honey, I forgot my purse.

46:02.760 --> 46:04.762
Darryl. Darryl.

46:05.179 --> 46:08.515
Sweetheart.
You can't just fall asleep like this.

46:09.016 --> 46:12.770
Oh, honey, I know that you're tired,
but you have to watch the baby.

46:12.936 --> 46:16.023
You take your eyes off him for a
minute, God knows what could happen.

46:16.190 --> 46:17.691
I was....

46:18.609 --> 46:21.111
-Darryl.
-I was....

46:21.278 --> 46:23.155
-What...?
-I don't--

46:23.322 --> 46:27.201
Honey, just take him to the park
or something, okay?

46:27.618 --> 46:28.952
Okay.

46:30.537 --> 46:31.872
What...?

46:39.546 --> 46:42.841
Peekaboo. Then I don't-- What?

46:48.013 --> 46:50.641
We gonna play baseball.
We gonna play football.

46:50.808 --> 46:53.727
And we're gonna play golf.

46:54.061 --> 46:56.939
And we're gonna shoot a plane.

46:57.105 --> 46:59.566
We're gonna have fun.

47:03.278 --> 47:04.947
There we go.

47:05.113 --> 47:08.575
All right, son. Now, don't be afraid
to really swing that bat, okay?

47:08.742 --> 47:11.995
Now, the trick is to really
keep your eye on the ball, okay?

47:12.162 --> 47:13.705
Here we go.

47:18.919 --> 47:21.547
Yeah, you want that sucker
to really fly.

47:21.713 --> 47:23.841
You wanna give that thing a lot of air,
okay?

47:24.007 --> 47:25.717
There you go.
Give it some good pump.

47:25.884 --> 47:28.428
You want it to really fly.
You want it to blast off.

47:28.595 --> 47:32.099
Yeah, there you go.
No, no, no. You want to point that up.

47:32.266 --> 47:35.561
No. No, no, son. What are you--?
No, no, no. Don't push that button.

47:38.856 --> 47:42.067
Okay, so now, what you wanna do
is you wanna wind that baby up...

47:42.234 --> 47:44.278
...and you throw it
as hard as you can, okay?

47:44.444 --> 47:46.029
-Okay.
-All right. Come on.

47:50.033 --> 47:52.452
Look at that. Yeah.

47:53.495 --> 47:56.290
Yeah. Look at that sucker.

47:58.792 --> 48:00.127
Where'd it go?

48:10.095 --> 48:11.889
The ducks teach you playfulness.

48:12.055 --> 48:14.766
Here, you can borrow this if you want.
He'd love it.

48:14.933 --> 48:16.977
Hey, Dad-For-A-Weekend.

48:17.603 --> 48:18.812
How's it going?

48:18.979 --> 48:21.940
I think they designed all the toys
to hit you in the nuts.

48:22.482 --> 48:23.901
Oh, yeah.

48:24.735 --> 48:25.736
Get off.

48:25.903 --> 48:29.072
Richard, I bet my son could
kick the crap out of both your kids...

48:29.239 --> 48:31.909
...blindfolded,
one hand tied behind his back.

48:32.075 --> 48:35.537
Come on, Greg.
Nicholas is a sweet, sensitive kid.

48:35.704 --> 48:37.748
He's not a fighter.

48:37.915 --> 48:40.959
I'm telling you, Darryl, see, you gotta
be tough on kids nowadays.

48:41.126 --> 48:44.588
All right, the slightest bit of weakness
and they could end up...

48:47.007 --> 48:48.467
...like that.

48:48.634 --> 48:51.553
Well, I don't know about all that,
but I gotta be honest with you.

48:51.720 --> 48:54.806
I'm starting to dig this father thing.
It's kind of cool.

48:54.973 --> 48:58.685
It's kind of like I get to do all the things
that I never did with my dad.

48:58.852 --> 49:00.687
-You know?
-That's real cute.

49:01.229 --> 49:04.441
Really, I think I'm having
a positive influence on him.

49:05.943 --> 49:08.362
Cee-lo, that's right.
Dig up in your OshKosh...

49:08.528 --> 49:09.988
...your babyGap and pay the man.

49:10.155 --> 49:13.367
-That's right. Yeah.
-It's not fair.

49:13.533 --> 49:15.202
Come on,
put your money in the pot.

49:15.369 --> 49:17.120
Whine to your mama,
don't whine to me.

49:17.287 --> 49:18.622
Right, good game, good game.

49:18.789 --> 49:20.290
Come here, you guys. Come here.

49:21.833 --> 49:24.002
Yo, y'all bring
your money tomorrow...

49:24.169 --> 49:27.047
...I'm gonna sell y'all some pictures
of some naked girls.

49:28.715 --> 49:31.385
What I say?
Y'all don't like big breasts?

49:31.551 --> 49:33.178
Daddy, can I have some ice cream?

49:33.345 --> 49:34.721
Sure, sweetie. What flavor?

49:34.888 --> 49:36.515
-Vanilla.
-You got it.

49:36.682 --> 49:38.141
-I think we'll go with you.
-Okay.

49:39.393 --> 49:41.395
-You're getting big.
-Janet, do me a favor?

49:42.562 --> 49:44.898
-Could you watch Calvin for me?
-No problem.

49:45.983 --> 49:47.401
Calvin.

49:47.567 --> 49:48.860
Percy.

49:49.820 --> 49:53.240
-Cal, you get the diamond?
-Yeah, it's in the diaper bag. Come on.

49:53.407 --> 49:54.574
Hold hands.

49:54.741 --> 49:57.285
Cal, which one is it?

49:57.744 --> 49:59.496
The one with the duck on it.

50:01.289 --> 50:04.918
-They all got ducks on them.
-I think it's that one.

50:05.419 --> 50:07.087
Come on.

50:07.879 --> 50:09.923
Hey, that guy's not even
here with a child.

50:10.090 --> 50:11.550
Hey.

50:12.884 --> 50:15.387
Hey, get away from him.
Girls, let's get him!

50:15.554 --> 50:18.056
-I'm out.
-There he is.

50:19.599 --> 50:21.852
Pumpkin, are you okay?

50:22.269 --> 50:23.937
-Did he touch you anywhere?
-No.

50:24.104 --> 50:26.273
No? Okay. Good.

50:26.440 --> 50:28.608
-Hey, is everything okay, Janet?
-It's not okay.

50:28.775 --> 50:31.445
Some sick pervert tried to run away
with this little guy.

50:31.611 --> 50:33.572
Hey, that psycho
took my diaper bag.

50:33.739 --> 50:35.782
-What?
-Damn.

50:36.950 --> 50:38.618
Pervert.

50:40.120 --> 50:43.915
Okay, we gonna get you home
where it's nice and safe, all right?

50:47.627 --> 50:50.297
Keys, keys. I want the keys.

50:50.547 --> 50:54.801
Keys, keys, I want keys.
Keys. Keys. Keys.

50:54.968 --> 50:57.137
No, no, no.
Daddy needs these to drive the--

50:57.304 --> 50:58.805
-Keys.
-Oh, God.

50:58.972 --> 51:00.724
Keys. Give me the keys.

51:01.308 --> 51:03.894
-Oh, no. Here. Take that.
-No. Keys.

51:04.061 --> 51:05.979
-I want keys.
-Play with that for a while.

51:06.146 --> 51:08.482
-No, no, no. I need these.
-I want keys.

51:09.316 --> 51:10.734
-Want keys.
-Okay, here.

51:11.318 --> 51:13.945
-Keys.
-All right, all right.

51:14.112 --> 51:18.033
All right, you wait right there,
and I'll be right back, okay?

51:23.580 --> 51:25.248
Hey!

51:25.415 --> 51:26.833
My car. My kid.

51:28.168 --> 51:30.837
Hey, stop!

51:36.885 --> 51:38.929
Someone just stole my car
with my kid in it.

51:39.096 --> 51:40.347
Hop in.

51:41.431 --> 51:43.809
-Thank you.
-Let's go get that son of a bitch.

51:54.194 --> 51:55.654
Damn.

52:07.707 --> 52:10.377
Man, my wife is gonna kill me
when she finds out about this.

52:10.544 --> 52:12.379
My advice to you
is don't tell her a word.

52:12.546 --> 52:14.381
I left Bobby Jr.
at an amusement park.

52:14.548 --> 52:17.050
Told his father he was at
summer camp. Bought me a week.

52:22.222 --> 52:25.267
Hello? I'm on my way.
I'll be there in about five minutes.

52:25.433 --> 52:27.894
I have the cupcakes. Yes.

52:28.061 --> 52:29.896
I didn't bring juice.
You didn't tell me.

52:30.063 --> 52:32.649
-Don't talk to me that way.
-Excuse me.

52:33.275 --> 52:34.901
-I'm hanging up.
-Oh, my God.

52:35.068 --> 52:36.903
I'm hanging up. I'm hanging up.

52:38.572 --> 52:40.657
Watch the road, moron.

52:41.408 --> 52:43.743
Come on, baby. Let's go.
Let's do this.

52:51.710 --> 52:55.088
Oh, wow, you are really upset.

52:55.255 --> 52:58.925
It makes me feel so good to know that
there are people out there who care...

52:59.092 --> 53:01.219
-Mommy, Mommy....
-...about their kids-- What?

53:01.386 --> 53:02.387
--as I do.

53:02.554 --> 53:04.472
-Mommy, Mommy.
-Just one second, honey.

53:04.639 --> 53:07.684
I'm fixing my makeup.

53:07.851 --> 53:10.020
-Mom.
-What?

53:10.187 --> 53:12.439
I think Dillon did a doodie.

53:12.606 --> 53:15.275
-Mom, hurry up. Come on, hurry.
-Change him.

53:15.442 --> 53:18.403
Oh, wait, no. Wait.

53:19.863 --> 53:22.574
Oh, my God. Excuse me. A truck.

53:22.782 --> 53:25.118
Excuse me. A truck.

53:25.285 --> 53:27.245
There you go.
Can you hand me the powder?

53:27.412 --> 53:28.914
What? No, stop.

53:29.956 --> 53:31.541
We're gonna die.

53:38.381 --> 53:40.425
Oh, my God.

53:40.592 --> 53:42.802
Don't worry.
You'll get your little boy back.

53:42.969 --> 53:45.805
It ain't worth it. Let me out.

53:52.312 --> 53:53.605
Oh, no.

54:09.746 --> 54:12.832
-Suspect got away.
-Damn it!

54:13.750 --> 54:18.255
-But the kid's okay.
-I want my daddy.

54:19.631 --> 54:23.843
I want Daddy. I want my daddy.

54:24.010 --> 54:25.887
Thanks for everything.

54:27.597 --> 54:29.683
Oh, by the way, I run a carpool...

54:29.849 --> 54:32.852
...if the little one ever needs
a ride to preschool.

54:33.103 --> 54:34.854
-Daddy.
-That's my kid.

54:35.146 --> 54:37.357
Daddy. Daddy.

54:37.524 --> 54:40.944
-Are you okay, huh?
-Daddy.

54:41.236 --> 54:45.532
-Son's okay, but car's totaled.
-Screw the car. Long as he's okay.

54:45.699 --> 54:48.618
I'm sorry, man.
I'm sorry, little buddy.

54:48.785 --> 54:51.371
I would never want anything
to happen to you.

54:51.538 --> 54:53.415
I love you, man.

54:56.209 --> 54:57.794
-Mr. W.
-Yeah.

54:57.961 --> 55:00.880
Your boy came through. I got it.

55:03.216 --> 55:05.719
Bring it to me.
Watch my drink, babe.

55:21.067 --> 55:25.071
Keep looking. Keep digging in there.
It's in there. It's in there, baby.

55:26.072 --> 55:27.907
Look around in there.

55:28.950 --> 55:31.703
Mr. Dub,
could you dig deeper in there?

55:31.870 --> 55:33.163
Damn.

55:35.290 --> 55:37.083
Is that a dirty diaper?

55:38.335 --> 55:41.713
-Did I just touch a dirty diaper?
-Wait a minute.

55:41.880 --> 55:44.132
Whoa, that baby had
lasagna last night.

55:44.299 --> 55:46.760
I know it's in here.
The diamond's in here.

55:46.926 --> 55:50.680
-He said the diamond's in there.
-Your 24 hours are up, Percy.

55:55.310 --> 55:57.354
And you haven't
delivered my diamond.

55:57.520 --> 55:59.689
Do you know
how that makes me feel?

56:00.940 --> 56:04.277
Please, Mr. Dub, give me a little
more time. I promise I'll get the rock.

56:04.444 --> 56:07.030
It makes me feel like
wanting to hurt you very badly.

56:07.572 --> 56:09.366
But I won't.

56:09.949 --> 56:13.119
Because that diamond
means more to me than your life.

56:13.453 --> 56:15.705
Now, you get out of here
and find me that diamond.

56:18.750 --> 56:22.337
-Get out of here.
-I promise you, okay? I got you.

56:23.671 --> 56:26.132
Follow him. Find his partner.

56:26.299 --> 56:29.803
Get me my diamond,
then stick them both in the ground.

56:30.428 --> 56:32.555
Aren't you taking this a bit far?

56:32.722 --> 56:35.266
I didn't even know they made
a LoJack for kids.

56:35.433 --> 56:39.062
No, I'm telling you, I'm not taking
any chances. This guy's tricky.

56:39.229 --> 56:40.605
Maybe I should skip the game.

56:40.772 --> 56:44.818
Are you crazy?
They're playing Detroit, D.

56:45.402 --> 56:49.280
Why don't we pack up the little ugly
son of a bitch and take him with us?

56:52.283 --> 56:54.160
You really think
that's the best idea?

56:54.327 --> 56:56.663
Yeah, Richard,
I do think it's the best idea.

56:56.830 --> 56:59.165
It's never too early
to become a Chicago fan.

57:01.084 --> 57:04.337
-You know what, I'm in.
-Yeah. Come on, let's go.

57:04.504 --> 57:08.091
Okay, but when the ladies ask,
I was the one that said no.

57:08.258 --> 57:09.509
I-- No.

57:15.849 --> 57:18.351
Are you ready to see how exciting
a hockey game is?

57:18.518 --> 57:19.811
It's like boxing on ice.

57:19.978 --> 57:22.480
Five rows up behind the penalty box.
Who the man?

57:22.647 --> 57:24.149
-Yeah, boy. Yeah.
-That's right.

57:28.862 --> 57:31.614
Let's go. Come on. Come on.

57:32.282 --> 57:35.201
-Go, go, go.
-Come on, what are you watching?

57:37.912 --> 57:39.706
Did you see that play? Hey.

57:39.873 --> 57:41.958
What you got in your mouth there,
little fella?

57:42.667 --> 57:46.045
What you got in your mouth?
Open up. Open. Let me see.

57:46.754 --> 57:48.715
Oh, okay, it was nothing.

57:48.882 --> 57:50.800
Come on.

57:53.094 --> 57:54.095
T Man!

57:54.262 --> 57:56.222
-Come on.
-Here we go.

57:56.848 --> 57:58.099
Yeah.

58:00.727 --> 58:02.312
Yeah.

58:06.441 --> 58:09.068
-All right, who needs drinks?
-I'm good.

58:09.235 --> 58:14.908
Oh, wait. Yeah,
I guess I need another one, please.

58:16.659 --> 58:17.911
-Thanks.
-Thanks.

58:18.119 --> 58:20.622
How about you guys?
Anything to drink?

58:20.788 --> 58:23.583
-Yeah, I'll grab a beer, sure.
-Me too, me too. Get me one.

58:24.250 --> 58:26.753
-There you go.
-Thank you.

58:26.920 --> 58:30.465
-Okay. Here you go.
-Nice ass.

58:33.259 --> 58:34.594
Pig.

58:35.762 --> 58:37.514
Tramp.

58:48.358 --> 58:51.778
What the hell was that for?

58:52.320 --> 58:54.197
-What did I do?
-You know her?

58:54.364 --> 58:55.782
No, I don't know her.

58:57.075 --> 58:58.368
I don't know-- I don't.

58:58.535 --> 59:00.245
-Hey, man. Get your own.
-Hey.

59:00.537 --> 59:02.121
-What?
-Beer. It's empty.

59:02.288 --> 59:04.707
-So get another one.
-I'm gonna--

59:04.874 --> 59:06.960
-Get off. Wait.
-What's your problem, man?

59:08.044 --> 59:10.380
-Come on, man. Come on, Miller.
-Miller.

59:13.424 --> 59:15.385
You suck.

59:17.595 --> 59:20.807
-You suck, man. You suck.
-Shut it, you losers!

59:20.974 --> 59:23.935
Want some of me? Come down here.
Come play with the big boys.

59:24.102 --> 59:27.313
-You're a bully. You're a bully, man.
-Yeah, I thought so, you princess.

59:27.480 --> 59:30.316
-Come on, you.
-Pick on somebody your own size.

59:30.483 --> 59:32.485
Come on down here, then.

59:36.072 --> 59:37.782
Who did that?

59:40.451 --> 59:43.121
You. You're dead!

59:45.999 --> 59:47.500
He's gonna kill me.

59:48.668 --> 59:51.462
-Get out of my way.
-It wasn't me. It was the baby.

59:51.629 --> 59:53.089
-You're mine.
-Get him.

59:53.256 --> 59:54.674
Hockey fight!

01:00:01.014 --> 01:00:04.017
He's got my ear.
Get this baby off of me.

01:00:08.521 --> 01:00:12.442
-Hey. Hey, hey.
-Is that all you got?

01:00:16.571 --> 01:00:18.031
I don't know, baby.

01:00:18.197 --> 01:00:21.075
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I'm not ready to be a dad yet.

01:00:21.242 --> 01:00:23.911
It really wasn't your fault.

01:00:24.203 --> 01:00:26.289
It's so funny, man.
It just happened so fast.

01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:28.333
I took my eyes off him
for one second and:

01:00:28.499 --> 01:00:30.543
He would've never had
another birthday again.

01:00:32.879 --> 01:00:35.840
Hey. Why don't we do that?

01:00:36.007 --> 01:00:37.717
Why don't we throw him
a birthday party?

01:00:37.884 --> 01:00:40.386
Well, we don't know
when his birthday is.

01:00:40.553 --> 01:00:42.180
So what?
We'll celebrate it tomorrow.

01:00:42.347 --> 01:00:45.892
We'll throw him a big birthday bash.
The biggest birthday party he ever had.

01:00:46.059 --> 01:00:48.019
That is a really good idea.

01:00:48.394 --> 01:00:52.315
And I got a little surprise for him.

01:00:52.482 --> 01:00:54.567
Does everyone know
what time it is?

01:00:54.734 --> 01:00:59.572
It's time to dance and sing,
and have lots and lots of fun.

01:00:59.739 --> 01:01:02.408
Hey there, boys and girls,
it's Dinosaur Rex...

01:01:02.575 --> 01:01:04.577
...your favorite prehistoric pal.

01:01:04.744 --> 01:01:06.871
Now, where's the birthday boy?

01:01:07.038 --> 01:01:08.581
-There.
-Yo, no, no.

01:01:08.790 --> 01:01:10.917
-Happy birthday.
-Hey, yo.

01:01:11.084 --> 01:01:12.418
Happy birthday, IittIe buddy

01:01:12.585 --> 01:01:13.753
I got a nasty hangover...

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:15.713
...and a rock stuck in my gut...

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:18.257
...that got my colon backed up
like rush-hour traffic.

01:01:18.424 --> 01:01:21.052
Now, either you're gonna stop
with your fruity kid songs...

01:01:21.219 --> 01:01:23.596
...or I'm gonna kick you
right in your furry balls.

01:01:24.097 --> 01:01:26.057
-All right?
-Well...

01:01:26.224 --> 01:01:28.434
...maybe we should talk
about manners.

01:01:28.601 --> 01:01:30.520
Now, manners are very important.

01:01:30.687 --> 01:01:34.607
When I was a tiny lizard, my mom
told me that if I had good manners...

01:01:34.774 --> 01:01:39.445
...one day I could grow up to be
president of the whole United States.

01:01:39.612 --> 01:01:41.989
But instead, you entertain
snotty-nosed kids...

01:01:42.156 --> 01:01:43.825
...in a crusty, blue dinosaur suit...

01:01:43.991 --> 01:01:47.328
...that smell like sweaty armpits
and baby urine.

01:01:48.621 --> 01:01:50.081
Far cry from president, buddy.

01:01:54.085 --> 01:01:56.254
I just got out of rehab.

01:01:56.421 --> 01:01:58.589
Because of the new
"deadbeat dad" law...

01:01:58.756 --> 01:02:02.719
...my wife's garnishing 85 percent
of my dinosaur wages.

01:02:02.885 --> 01:02:06.806
So if I weren't afraid to lose this job,
I'd kick your ass.

01:02:06.973 --> 01:02:10.226
Oh, you so pathetic you need
$4.50 an hour that bad?

01:02:10.393 --> 01:02:12.228
Come on, get your ass kicked.

01:02:16.232 --> 01:02:18.317
-Bring it on.
-Come on. Come on, then.

01:02:19.402 --> 01:02:22.488
-Hey.
-Oh, you mine now. You mine.

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:26.617
Get him, get him, get him.

01:02:29.954 --> 01:02:31.622
You little bastard.

01:02:34.167 --> 01:02:36.502
That was a cheap shot.

01:02:38.504 --> 01:02:41.841
-You stink.
-I hate your show.

01:02:42.008 --> 01:02:44.677
It has been confirmed,
the driver of the stoIen vehicIe...

01:02:44.844 --> 01:02:48.389
...matches the description of
the suspect in Friday's diamond heist.

01:02:48.556 --> 01:02:50.933
-PoIice are Iooking to question...
-I knew it.

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:52.602
...CaIvin "Baby Face" Sims.

01:02:52.769 --> 01:02:56.189
Sims, who was recentIy reIeased from
state prison, has thus far eIuded--

01:02:56.355 --> 01:02:58.524
Hey, guys, what do you say
we liven this party up?

01:02:58.691 --> 01:03:00.526
We have a little
father-son football game.

01:03:00.693 --> 01:03:03.696
Football? Greg, I don't know.
I don't think that's a good idea.

01:03:03.863 --> 01:03:06.616
Nicholas is a little young
and small for football.

01:03:06.783 --> 01:03:09.327
How about Simon Says instead?

01:03:09.535 --> 01:03:12.330
You know, Richard, your son
practically squats to pee.

01:03:12.872 --> 01:03:15.666
Come on, man.
Look, we gotta scar these kids for life.

01:03:15.833 --> 01:03:17.668
All right?
We gotta toughen them up a bit.

01:03:17.835 --> 01:03:19.212
You don't--

01:03:19.879 --> 01:03:20.880
-Come on.
-Come on.

01:03:21.047 --> 01:03:23.299
Darryl, you in,
or does Calvin have ballet class?

01:03:23.466 --> 01:03:24.550
I'm down.

01:03:25.051 --> 01:03:26.719
-All right.
-All right, let's do it.

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:32.642
Football? That's not in the books.
I've read all the books.

01:03:32.809 --> 01:03:35.353
Yeah, you're wetting yourself here.
Go play football.

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:37.146
-You sure?
-Rich, let's go.

01:03:37.313 --> 01:03:40.983
-It's 7-0 already.
-All right. I'm playing football.

01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:43.236
Take off the sli-- Oh, my God.

01:03:43.402 --> 01:03:45.613
Whoa, here we go.

01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:48.908
P-U-T-I-T-I-N
Put it in

01:03:49.075 --> 01:03:52.245
P-U-T-I-T-I-N
Put it in

01:03:53.621 --> 01:03:57.250
You and me, this is father-son stuff.
Right here, huh? Here we go.

01:03:57.416 --> 01:04:00.878
-Ready, set....
-I love you, baby.

01:04:01.045 --> 01:04:02.713
Hike.

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:04.924
One Victoria's Secret. Two--

01:04:06.092 --> 01:04:07.677
-Oh, God.
-Yeah.

01:04:07.844 --> 01:04:10.221
You want the hospital
or the graveyard, punk?

01:04:10.721 --> 01:04:11.889
Yeah.

01:04:12.056 --> 01:04:13.850
-Here we go.
-Are you okay?

01:04:14.016 --> 01:04:16.853
-I thought this was a touch game.
-You have his license number?

01:04:17.019 --> 01:04:19.438
-What is he doing?
-Sorry, D, did I hurt your vagina?

01:04:19.605 --> 01:04:23.484
Our team is what? Dynamite
Our team is what? Dynamite

01:04:23.651 --> 01:04:25.444
-What's going on?
-Our team is

01:04:26.654 --> 01:04:27.697
Dynamite

01:04:27.864 --> 01:04:29.031
Break.

01:04:31.409 --> 01:04:33.202
Run, Dad.

01:04:36.372 --> 01:04:38.040
Nicholas, are you okay?

01:04:38.207 --> 01:04:40.084
Game on.

01:04:40.293 --> 01:04:43.588
-Just stay down, son.
-Thattaboy. You did it.

01:04:44.171 --> 01:04:46.966
Now, that's why we put creatine
in our corn flakes.

01:04:47.592 --> 01:04:49.886
-You okay?
-Punch him, kick him

01:04:50.052 --> 01:04:52.471
Stick him in the eye

01:04:53.973 --> 01:04:55.975
Here we go, here we go.

01:04:56.142 --> 01:04:58.311
All right, here we go.
Come on, boys.

01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:07.278
-Yeah.
-Your husband is a brute.

01:05:07.445 --> 01:05:09.071
-That's right.
-Yo, Greg, man.

01:05:09.238 --> 01:05:10.907
You should be ashamed of yourself!

01:05:11.073 --> 01:05:13.492
Hey, what are you doing, Greg?
Man, he's a kid.

01:05:13.659 --> 01:05:16.454
Hey, Darryl, Darryl.
Shut your pie-hole, man!

01:05:16.621 --> 01:05:19.332
-It's football. It's football.
-I know.

01:05:19.498 --> 01:05:21.918
-Stop acting like a bitch.
-Why you starting, man?

01:05:22.084 --> 01:05:25.338
Come on, let's go. Man, come on.
You guys suck.

01:05:25.713 --> 01:05:27.840
It's time to kick some butt. Come on.

01:05:28.591 --> 01:05:32.970
Ready, set, hike.

01:05:35.389 --> 01:05:38.142
-I got him.
-Nicholas, block left. Come on.

01:05:40.978 --> 01:05:43.356
-Tommy.
-How do you like them apples?

01:05:43.522 --> 01:05:46.359
-Get him.
-Yeah, come on.

01:05:47.485 --> 01:05:50.696
-Yeah.
-Yes. Yes.

01:05:54.283 --> 01:05:58.162
Tommy, what's going on?
You call that a tackle?

01:05:58.621 --> 01:06:00.331
Told you,
you gotta stay in the zone.

01:06:00.498 --> 01:06:03.042
You gotta eat some lightning
and crap thunder, son.

01:06:03.209 --> 01:06:06.003
You wanna get up?
Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:06:07.296 --> 01:06:11.467
-Come on. Come on, man.
-Shut up, Darryl. It's my son.

01:06:12.343 --> 01:06:16.973
All right, it's do-or-die time.
Last point wins.

01:06:17.848 --> 01:06:20.309
Nicholas, you ready?

01:06:21.394 --> 01:06:25.356
Purple Haze. Purple Haze 1 5.

01:06:25.690 --> 01:06:29.902
Ready, set, hike.

01:06:31.070 --> 01:06:32.321
Follow me.

01:06:34.407 --> 01:06:36.534
-Go, Nicholas. Go, Nicholas.
-Come on, come on.

01:06:37.493 --> 01:06:39.078
-Bring it on.
-Go. Go.

01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:43.916
-Go. Oh, my goodness.
-Come on, get up.

01:06:45.084 --> 01:06:47.086
Go, Nicholas. Go, Nicholas.
Go, Nicholas.

01:06:47.253 --> 01:06:49.839
-Come on.
-Tommy, hurry.

01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:53.384
This team is dynamite
We're dynamite

01:06:54.593 --> 01:06:58.472
-That's my son.
-That is my boy. That is my boy.

01:06:58.639 --> 01:07:01.600
You did it, son.
You crapped thunder.

01:07:01.767 --> 01:07:04.395
Nine months inside. Yes.

01:07:04.937 --> 01:07:06.397
Dad, Dad.

01:07:07.106 --> 01:07:10.276
-Yeah, son?
-You suck.

01:07:10.901 --> 01:07:12.695
Son, Dad hurt his pee-pee.

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:14.572
-Get up, you pussy.
-I can't.

01:07:18.743 --> 01:07:21.746
All right, everybody, here she comes.
Everybody, on three.

01:07:22.079 --> 01:07:24.457
One, two, three.

01:07:29.336 --> 01:07:31.047
They trying to punk me.

01:07:33.174 --> 01:07:36.218
AII these peopIe trying
to make a fooI out of me.

01:07:36.385 --> 01:07:37.970
Trying to make me cry.

01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:43.225
I didn't cry when I went to prison,
and I ain't gonna cry now.

01:07:43.392 --> 01:07:48.147
I don't care if I never had a mother
who threw me a party.

01:07:48.814 --> 01:07:53.861
Today is my birthday
and I'm gonna smiIe, damn it.

01:07:57.656 --> 01:07:59.366
I wish I had a famiIy.

01:07:59.533 --> 01:08:03.496
Well done, baby. What is this, Dad?

01:08:03.662 --> 01:08:06.665
I got a gift for the kid.
I know I've been a little tough on him.

01:08:06.832 --> 01:08:09.835
But it ain't easy when I've been
the center of all the attention...

01:08:10.002 --> 01:08:12.505
...and all of a sudden,
a kid walk in the house. A baby.

01:08:12.671 --> 01:08:16.133
I want you to know now,
from now on, I'm here to help.

01:08:16.841 --> 01:08:20.386
Now, Calvin, make a wish.

01:08:20.554 --> 01:08:25.684
And I hope all of your wishes
come true.

01:08:37.529 --> 01:08:39.115
Oh, great, you're here.

01:08:39.365 --> 01:08:41.700
The bouncy's in the back.
Just go around the side.

01:08:41.867 --> 01:08:43.368
No, I'm here to get my son.

01:08:44.953 --> 01:08:46.663
Little dude. Little man.

01:08:46.956 --> 01:08:48.582
-Son?
-That's right.

01:08:48.749 --> 01:08:51.836
I didn't think I could do it,
but I got myself together, baby.

01:08:52.002 --> 01:08:55.171
So if you just give me the boy,
we're gonna slide out of here.

01:08:55.339 --> 01:08:59.009
So you're the guy
who left his baby on my doorstep...

01:08:59.176 --> 01:09:02.011
-...in a dog basket?
-That's right, but that was a mistake.

01:09:02.179 --> 01:09:04.014
The guy who gave
his own kid a tattoo?

01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:06.725
Wait. I can explain that.
His mother was in the service.

01:09:06.892 --> 01:09:10.604
The person responsible for allowing
his baby boy to take a knife in the gut?

01:09:10.770 --> 01:09:12.398
Wait. The boy needed discipline.

01:09:12.564 --> 01:09:14.191
-You should be castrated.
-What?

01:09:14.358 --> 01:09:16.234
Ain't nothing wrong
with my bowel movement.

01:09:16.402 --> 01:09:19.029
I go two, three times a day.
Let me tell you something.

01:09:19.196 --> 01:09:21.198
I ain't got to explain nothing.
I'm a grown--

01:09:21.365 --> 01:09:24.660
You just caught yourself the official
Brooklyn beat-down, homes.

01:09:24.827 --> 01:09:26.996
You just entered the dragon,
homeboy.

01:09:27.162 --> 01:09:29.456
Word up. I'm gonna tap you
right on your Flintstone.

01:09:29.622 --> 01:09:32.376
Here it come, homeboy.
Here it come, homeboy. Here it--

01:09:37.006 --> 01:09:38.716
Who is Mike Jones?

01:09:40.509 --> 01:09:42.595
Get the hell out of here.
And don't come back.

01:09:45.555 --> 01:09:47.474
I want my mother.

01:09:48.434 --> 01:09:52.104
Looks like Percy's partner
decided to keep the rock for himself.

01:09:52.270 --> 01:09:55.107
-Better go tell Mr. Walken.
-Yeah.

01:09:55.399 --> 01:09:59.278
There you go. Good.

01:09:59.945 --> 01:10:01.405
-Come on.
-Honestly, Janet...

01:10:01.572 --> 01:10:02.948
...I don't know how you do it.

01:10:03.115 --> 01:10:05.284
-What's that, sweetie?
-All of this.

01:10:05.451 --> 01:10:07.703
The parenting, the responsibility.

01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:10.164
It's really no different
than any other career.

01:10:10.873 --> 01:10:14.126
I mean, you have scheduling, you
have planning. Budgeting, of course.

01:10:14.293 --> 01:10:16.962
I guess the big difference
is that my boss...

01:10:17.129 --> 01:10:19.298
...I want to slather in kisses
all day long.

01:10:19.632 --> 01:10:22.635
And I can, without being sued
for sexual harassment.

01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:26.639
And you don't miss the job at all?

01:10:26.805 --> 01:10:29.642
You know,
sometimes I think I miss it...

01:10:29.808 --> 01:10:32.311
...but then I remember
all they really liked about me...

01:10:32.478 --> 01:10:34.313
...was the money
that I made for them.

01:10:34.813 --> 01:10:39.693
You know? I mean, this....
This is real. These guys dig me.

01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:43.989
I am a diva, a giant, a goddess.

01:10:44.156 --> 01:10:46.617
I'm perfect. Aren't I perfect?

01:10:49.286 --> 01:10:51.330
Mommy, I don't feel good.

01:10:51.497 --> 01:10:53.791
What's the matter, honey?
You got a tummy ache?

01:10:53.958 --> 01:10:57.503
Yeah? Think maybe it's from
eating 1 6 pieces of cake...

01:10:57.670 --> 01:10:59.213
...and beef jerky...

01:10:59.380 --> 01:11:01.674
...and a balloon? Yeah.

01:11:03.384 --> 01:11:07.304
-Is he gonna be okay?
-Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:11:07.471 --> 01:11:08.973
Just a little teaspoon of this--

01:11:09.139 --> 01:11:10.349
It is magic.

01:11:10.516 --> 01:11:14.353
--and he will poop very shortly.

01:11:14.979 --> 01:11:16.647
It'll slide right out.

01:11:18.649 --> 01:11:19.692
Good boy.

01:11:20.109 --> 01:11:22.027
Well, maybe you should
take him home.

01:11:22.194 --> 01:11:23.862
Yes, maybe we shall.

01:11:24.029 --> 01:11:26.991
-You wanna go home?
-And you too. Yeah.

01:11:28.325 --> 01:11:30.536
Oh, goodness,
what do you feed this kid?

01:11:30.703 --> 01:11:32.121
What do I feed you?

01:11:32.288 --> 01:11:34.206
-All right. I'll see you soon?
-Okay.

01:11:34.373 --> 01:11:36.208
-Thank you.
-See you later. Come on, hon.

01:11:36.375 --> 01:11:39.586
Such a good boy,
helping your mom.

01:12:01.775 --> 01:12:04.361
Oh, sweetie. Wha--?

01:12:04.695 --> 01:12:08.407
Oh, honey, what's wrong? Sweetie?

01:12:08.574 --> 01:12:11.702
-Hey, little man, what's the matter?
-I don't think he's feeling well.

01:12:11.869 --> 01:12:13.662
Are you okay?

01:12:16.999 --> 01:12:19.626
What's the matter,
you gotta make a poo-poos?

01:12:20.961 --> 01:12:24.423
You gotta make a poo-poo.
He gotta make a little poo-poo, yeah.

01:12:27.301 --> 01:12:28.719
God.

01:12:29.261 --> 01:12:31.430
What's going on, man, huh?

01:12:45.402 --> 01:12:48.447
Ain't that cute.
He made a little surprise...

01:12:48.614 --> 01:12:49.990
...for Mommy.

01:12:50.157 --> 01:12:51.450
-Mom--? For me?
-Go ahead.

01:12:51.617 --> 01:12:54.787
-Mommy take care.
-Darryl, why me? I did it last time.

01:12:54.953 --> 01:12:56.872
Wash your hands
before you make dinner.

01:12:57.039 --> 01:12:58.832
Come on, Calvin.

01:12:59.625 --> 01:13:00.793
Come on.

01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:10.469
Man, what a day.

01:13:12.638 --> 01:13:15.182
-I can't believe you did this.
-Did what?

01:13:15.349 --> 01:13:18.769
-This. Darryl, it's so beautiful.
-I did-- I--

01:13:18.936 --> 01:13:21.271
It's so romantic,
the way you put it in his diaper.

01:13:21.438 --> 01:13:24.566
Then you made me change him
even though I didn't want to. Oh, so--

01:13:25.317 --> 01:13:27.486
-No, but, honey--
-We should go out and celebrate.

01:13:27.653 --> 01:13:29.321
-Somewhere nice? I'll change.
-Wait.

01:13:29.488 --> 01:13:31.990
Thank you, baby.
I love it, I love it, I love it.

01:13:32.157 --> 01:13:35.452
-I love it, I love it, I love it.
-I gotta talk to you.

01:13:35.619 --> 01:13:37.454
-Baby, come here.
-Damn.

01:13:40.791 --> 01:13:42.501
Are you sure you guys
are gonna be okay?

01:13:42.668 --> 01:13:46.672
-We'll be fine, won't we, little boy?
-I love Papa.

01:13:46.839 --> 01:13:48.465
-All right. Bye.
-Okay.

01:13:48.632 --> 01:13:50.843
Y'all have a good time, now.
I know we will.

01:13:53.137 --> 01:13:54.847
Bye-bye.

01:13:55.347 --> 01:13:59.518
We going to have a good time.
He's a nice little boy too. Yes, indeedy.

01:13:59.685 --> 01:14:02.604
He's a cute little boy too.
Look at the little baby.

01:14:02.771 --> 01:14:06.525
Yeah, he's a good little boy.
One, two, three.

01:14:08.694 --> 01:14:11.029
Now, you come clean,
you little punk. Who are you?

01:14:11.196 --> 01:14:13.949
Where you from? What you all about?
What is all this?

01:14:17.536 --> 01:14:20.539
Look here, old man.
You been a real pain in my butt.

01:14:20.706 --> 01:14:23.041
And you're right,
I did rob that jewelry store.

01:14:23.208 --> 01:14:26.211
And now there's some
real bad people after me.

01:14:26.378 --> 01:14:28.547
And the people you love
are gonna get hurt...

01:14:28.714 --> 01:14:30.174
...if I don't get that diamond.

01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:34.887
And I don't want that to happen,
so you better just stay out of my way.

01:14:40.893 --> 01:14:43.562
Hey, yo, Percy, it's me.
Be here in a hour.

01:14:43.729 --> 01:14:46.398
-I'll have the diamond then.
-How can you do this to us?

01:14:46.982 --> 01:14:49.151
We took you in,
thought you were a child in need.

01:14:49.318 --> 01:14:52.905
-You turn out to be a lowlife thief.
-Look, I didn't mean for it to go this far.

01:14:53.071 --> 01:14:55.157
I was just trying
to get my diamond and be out.

01:14:55.324 --> 01:14:59.411
-You ain't getting away with it.
-Then it's time to dance. Come on.

01:15:00.621 --> 01:15:02.414
-Baby, I--
-Sweetheart...

01:15:02.581 --> 01:15:04.583
...this means so much to me.

01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:06.877
I know it's not real.
Look at the size of this.

01:15:07.044 --> 01:15:09.046
There's no way
you could afford that, but....

01:15:09.254 --> 01:15:13.759
Well, it's what the ring symbolizes
that makes it so special to me.

01:15:13.926 --> 01:15:16.595
-Yeah, about that, baby. I didn't--
-Please. Let me finish.

01:15:16.762 --> 01:15:20.933
Please. I know that you are
not the one who isn't ready. It's me.

01:15:21.099 --> 01:15:23.685
I have always needed
for everything to fit my schedule.

01:15:23.852 --> 01:15:27.231
And you have shown me that
sometimes life doesn't work that way.

01:15:27.397 --> 01:15:31.276
It's unpredictable, and sometimes
you have to go with the flow and....

01:15:31.443 --> 01:15:33.445
I'll never be ready
until it just happens.

01:15:33.612 --> 01:15:36.907
-Vanessa, I just wanna tell you--
-I think that we should just do it.

01:15:37.950 --> 01:15:39.576
Do what?

01:15:39.785 --> 01:15:41.119
Let's adopt him.

01:15:41.286 --> 01:15:43.789
Tomorrow let's take the baby
to Child Services...

01:15:43.956 --> 01:15:45.249
...and start the paperwork.

01:15:45.415 --> 01:15:46.959
You mean we can keep him?

01:15:47.125 --> 01:15:49.044
-Yeah.
-Yes.

01:15:50.295 --> 01:15:52.256
So, what did you wanna tell me?

01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:55.551
Nothing.

01:15:55.717 --> 01:15:57.553
Nothing at all. Let's-- Let's toast.

01:15:58.053 --> 01:15:59.680
Okay.

01:16:03.225 --> 01:16:04.977
You don't mess
with a man from Detroit.

01:16:05.143 --> 01:16:06.311
I'm from Detroit.

01:16:06.478 --> 01:16:08.647
The hell you doing?

01:16:08.814 --> 01:16:10.732
-What's going on?
-Daddy, get off of him.

01:16:10.899 --> 01:16:12.943
-Get off of the baby.
-Stop it.

01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:14.611
Ain't no baby. That's a criminal.

01:16:14.778 --> 01:16:17.948
I have had it with you.
I'm calling Whispering Glen.

01:16:18.115 --> 01:16:19.366
Vanessa, I ain't crazy.

01:16:19.533 --> 01:16:22.286
You see, I know what is
and I know what ain't is.

01:16:22.452 --> 01:16:24.621
And he ain't is what he say he is.

01:16:24.788 --> 01:16:26.999
You see, "is" is and "ain'ts" ain't.

01:16:27.416 --> 01:16:29.126
Check the teddy bear.
The teddy bear.

01:16:29.293 --> 01:16:30.752
Teddy bear knows.

01:16:30.919 --> 01:16:33.630
-Come on, then. Please.
-We'll take good care of your father.

01:16:33.797 --> 01:16:35.841
Whispering Glen is a safe facility.

01:16:36.008 --> 01:16:38.093
Give him
a couple of days to adjust...

01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:40.596
-Let me go.
-...and then come visit.

01:16:48.687 --> 01:16:52.691
Vanessa, believe me.
"Is" is, "ain'ts" ain't.

01:16:52.858 --> 01:16:54.860
Use the Taser if you have to.

01:16:55.027 --> 01:16:56.486
Check the teddy bear.

01:16:56.653 --> 01:16:58.155
The teddy bear.

01:17:00.324 --> 01:17:02.200
I'm gonna go put him to bed.

01:17:02.784 --> 01:17:04.328
Yeah.

01:17:12.794 --> 01:17:13.795
Man.

01:17:14.796 --> 01:17:18.175
How does one child turn a household
upside down in a weekend?

01:17:18.550 --> 01:17:21.637
Look at this place. It's a mess.

01:17:36.735 --> 01:17:38.570
Check the teddy bear.
The teddy bear.

01:17:38.737 --> 01:17:40.280
Teddy bear knows.

01:17:42.658 --> 01:17:44.242
Grandpa bad.

01:17:44.409 --> 01:17:47.037
No. No, baby. No, no, no.

01:17:47.204 --> 01:17:49.706
Papa's not bad.
He didn't mean to hurt you. He just--

01:17:50.415 --> 01:17:53.543
He's a little.... Yeah.

01:18:20.570 --> 01:18:23.281
Now, Iook here, oId man.
You've been a reaI pain in the butt.

01:18:23.949 --> 01:18:26.201
And you're right,
I did rob that jeweIry store.

01:18:26.368 --> 01:18:28.954
And now there's
a Iot of bad peopIe after me.

01:18:29.121 --> 01:18:30.747
PeopIe you Iove
are gonna get hurt...

01:18:30.914 --> 01:18:32.457
...if I don't get the diamond back.

01:18:32.624 --> 01:18:33.917
Vanessa.

01:18:34.084 --> 01:18:35.252
Vanessa.

01:18:35.961 --> 01:18:38.505
-Where's Calvin?
-I put him in the cr--

01:18:38.672 --> 01:18:40.924
-Where's the diamond?
-It was--

01:18:41.758 --> 01:18:43.969
-Gone.
-Damn. Pops was right.

01:18:44.136 --> 01:18:46.972
-I'm calling the police.
-I'm gonna get my dad.

01:18:48.682 --> 01:18:49.808
Dad!

01:18:49.975 --> 01:18:52.352
Yes, I have some information
on a stolen diamond.

01:18:53.145 --> 01:18:54.688
That's what I'm talking about.

01:18:54.855 --> 01:18:56.690
We did it. We rich, baby.

01:18:58.608 --> 01:19:01.820
-Yes. Just in the nick of time.
-We blinging.

01:19:01.987 --> 01:19:03.947
Walken and his goons
is going to that house.

01:19:04.322 --> 01:19:05.574
-What?
-Don't worry.

01:19:05.741 --> 01:19:07.701
He thinks Darryl's my partner.

01:19:07.868 --> 01:19:10.787
You idiot. Walken will kill him
if he don't have his diamond.

01:19:10.954 --> 01:19:14.166
Exactly. Which means
he won't be coming after you.

01:19:14.332 --> 01:19:17.794
It's perfect. We get away scot-free.

01:19:20.005 --> 01:19:21.548
This is the time you hit me, right?

01:19:24.885 --> 01:19:26.428
Let me pull over.

01:19:29.431 --> 01:19:32.726
Don't start beating me
like I'm a R & B singer, man.

01:19:34.352 --> 01:19:37.481
Police is here. Hey.

01:19:38.607 --> 01:19:40.650
Hey. Can I help you?

01:19:40.817 --> 01:19:42.778
Is this the guy that
double-crossed Percy?

01:19:42.944 --> 01:19:44.196
Yeah, that's the guy, boss.

01:19:44.362 --> 01:19:47.532
I don't know anybody named Percy.
You must got the wrong guy.

01:19:47.866 --> 01:19:50.327
-Cut the crap. I want my diamond.
-I don't have it.

01:19:50.494 --> 01:19:53.121
Too bad. I guess we're gonna
have to beat it out of you.

01:19:53.288 --> 01:19:56.041
I just called the police.
And they're on their way over here.

01:19:56.374 --> 01:19:58.668
Really? That doesn't leave us
much time then.

01:19:59.836 --> 01:20:02.506
-Take him.
-Wait, wait, wait. Wait, guys.

01:20:04.132 --> 01:20:05.300
Dada?

01:20:08.053 --> 01:20:09.721
Dada.

01:20:10.597 --> 01:20:11.681
Who's this little guy?

01:20:12.974 --> 01:20:14.559
That's my son.

01:20:17.187 --> 01:20:18.230
Take him upstairs.

01:20:20.148 --> 01:20:22.567
-I wanna talk to you.
-Cute kid.

01:20:22.734 --> 01:20:25.403
It's-- Just-- I don't have--
Listen. That's my nipple.

01:20:30.408 --> 01:20:31.535
Time to take a nap.

01:20:31.701 --> 01:20:33.286
Night-night?

01:20:33.453 --> 01:20:36.414
And don't worry about any loud noises
you may hear downstairs.

01:20:36.581 --> 01:20:38.834
It's just us beating up your daddy.

01:20:41.002 --> 01:20:42.587
Here you are.

01:20:45.757 --> 01:20:47.926
Nighty-night.

01:21:24.129 --> 01:21:25.463
Click.

01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:33.305
Now tell me, where's my diamond?

01:21:33.471 --> 01:21:34.806
I told you, I don't have it.

01:21:34.973 --> 01:21:36.892
You don't tell me
where my diamond is...

01:21:37.058 --> 01:21:40.687
...that cute little baby of yours
is gonna get hurt.

01:21:47.110 --> 01:21:49.654
Moron, get the kid. Get the kid.

01:21:51.364 --> 01:21:52.616
I want him.

01:21:58.413 --> 01:21:59.873
There you are, little buddy.

01:22:01.166 --> 01:22:02.542
Come on.

01:22:02.709 --> 01:22:04.044
Come to Uncle Rosco.

01:22:13.011 --> 01:22:14.638
Okay. Play nicey-nicey.

01:22:44.501 --> 01:22:46.378
Okay, get your ass up.

01:22:46.544 --> 01:22:49.506
Yeah, get up. I got you now.

01:22:49.673 --> 01:22:51.216
Yeah. Yeah.

01:22:52.050 --> 01:22:53.301
Ain't so tough now, are you?

01:22:57.806 --> 01:22:59.474
Back up. Or I'll shoot you.

01:22:59.891 --> 01:23:01.726
Shoot me, tough guy. Come on.

01:23:04.396 --> 01:23:05.563
Oh, boy.

01:23:05.730 --> 01:23:07.148
I'm surrounded by morons.

01:23:07.649 --> 01:23:09.526
Here. You dropped your gun, sir.

01:23:09.693 --> 01:23:12.153
Here you go. It's all yours.

01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:14.197
-What are you gonna do?
-Wait, wait, I--

01:23:14.364 --> 01:23:17.117
Come on, get out of here. Come on.

01:23:21.579 --> 01:23:22.580
All right, dude.

01:23:22.747 --> 01:23:27.252
You busted my Sergio da Vincis,
$62.50 designer frames.

01:23:27.419 --> 01:23:30.422
Not cool. Not cool.

01:23:30.922 --> 01:23:32.090
Okay, buddy.

01:23:32.257 --> 01:23:34.676
We can either do this the easy way
or the hard way.

01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:38.930
I think I like it the hard way.

01:23:48.356 --> 01:23:49.858
Did we get him?

01:23:50.567 --> 01:23:51.776
He's yours, man.

01:24:00.076 --> 01:24:01.077
Dude...

01:24:02.287 --> 01:24:04.122
...you just woke the dragon up.

01:24:04.289 --> 01:24:05.957
Prepare for pain.

01:24:06.124 --> 01:24:08.960
It's time for the dragon
to go back to sleep.

01:24:20.972 --> 01:24:22.766
What are you doing?

01:24:25.101 --> 01:24:27.979
-Stop.
-You going down, Sasquatch.

01:24:28.146 --> 01:24:29.981
Better not.

01:24:49.501 --> 01:24:51.044
What the hell is going on here?

01:24:51.211 --> 01:24:52.754
That ain't no baby.

01:24:52.921 --> 01:24:54.130
-Who else is here?
-Nobody.

01:24:54.297 --> 01:24:56.674
-Who's here?
-Nobody, I swear.

01:24:56.841 --> 01:24:58.426
Come on.

01:24:58.593 --> 01:25:00.929
Inside. Inside.

01:25:02.180 --> 01:25:03.389
There's the little monster.

01:25:04.015 --> 01:25:05.975
Listen, what does he got there?

01:25:06.351 --> 01:25:08.853
-It's an airplane.
-Tell him to get rid of the plane.

01:25:10.188 --> 01:25:11.231
Get rid of it.

01:25:12.524 --> 01:25:14.776
Calvin, throw the plane.

01:25:24.869 --> 01:25:25.870
What are you doing?

01:25:32.210 --> 01:25:33.837
Don't move.

01:25:35.088 --> 01:25:36.756
Save it, tough guy.

01:25:36.923 --> 01:25:39.050
You're not gonna shoot me.

01:25:39.634 --> 01:25:40.885
But I will.

01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:43.847
Freeze! Police!

01:25:44.013 --> 01:25:45.431
Freeze! Police!

01:25:45.598 --> 01:25:47.600
I got this. You check the house.

01:25:48.726 --> 01:25:51.688
Black cops, come with me.
White lady, you stay here.

01:25:51.896 --> 01:25:53.898
I'm telling you, guys,
that ain't no baby.

01:25:54.065 --> 01:25:56.317
He's the mastermind
behind the whole thing.

01:25:56.484 --> 01:25:58.027
Get him out of here.

01:25:58.194 --> 01:26:00.738
He's a stone-cold killer, that kid.

01:26:02.157 --> 01:26:03.658
Would you get this thing off me?

01:26:03.825 --> 01:26:07.245
Relax. Where you're going,
you might want to keep that on.

01:26:07.787 --> 01:26:09.581
I don't wanna go to jail.

01:26:09.747 --> 01:26:11.833
It's too dark. There's no TV.

01:26:16.796 --> 01:26:18.506
Hey, where you going, little guy?

01:26:21.926 --> 01:26:23.761
Ain't this your kid?

01:26:23.928 --> 01:26:24.929
Dada?

01:26:26.431 --> 01:26:27.932
Yeah, that's my son.

01:26:28.391 --> 01:26:30.351
Now, Calvin...

01:26:30.518 --> 01:26:32.770
...don't you have something
for the nice policeman?

01:26:34.439 --> 01:26:36.274
-No.
-Come on.

01:26:36.441 --> 01:26:39.402
You don't wanna go to prison
with the rest of the bad men, do you?

01:26:45.116 --> 01:26:46.242
There we go.

01:26:46.409 --> 01:26:48.453
Hey, the diamond.

01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:51.414
Thanks, kid. Now your dad's
gonna get a big reward.

01:26:51.581 --> 01:26:53.917
-A reward?
-Yeah, the insurance company...

01:26:54.083 --> 01:26:56.794
...offered $1 00,000
to whoever found the diamond.

01:26:56.961 --> 01:26:58.546
A hundred thousand dollars?

01:26:59.130 --> 01:27:00.632
God, that's gonna come in handy.

01:27:00.798 --> 01:27:02.300
Shoot, I could get my car fixed...

01:27:02.467 --> 01:27:04.219
...get a new wedding ring
for my wife...

01:27:04.385 --> 01:27:07.722
...I could take a vacation,
buy a TV set--

01:27:08.181 --> 01:27:10.099
And if there's
any change left over...

01:27:10.266 --> 01:27:13.144
...I'll give a little something
to my son.

01:27:13.478 --> 01:27:16.147
Right. Well, we'll be in touch.

01:27:26.491 --> 01:27:27.659
So....

01:27:27.909 --> 01:27:30.703
Oh, come on.
Let's not get all mushy about this.

01:27:30.870 --> 01:27:33.831
Let's just shake hands
and part ways like men.

01:27:33.998 --> 01:27:35.959
All right? No hard feelings?

01:27:36.334 --> 01:27:38.753
-Nah, no hard feelings.
-All right.

01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:41.798
Besides, it was kind of cool
having a son for a minute.

01:27:41.965 --> 01:27:44.968
See? There you go
with all that sentimental stuff.

01:27:45.843 --> 01:27:47.428
If that's the game you wanna play...

01:27:47.595 --> 01:27:50.515
...I guess it was cool
having you as a fa--

01:27:50.890 --> 01:27:52.058
Oh, boy.

01:27:52.225 --> 01:27:56.312
What I'm trying to say is,
I've never really had a daddy.

01:27:57.105 --> 01:27:58.398
I guess what I'm saying is...

01:27:58.564 --> 01:28:00.733
...you're gonna make a great father,
all right?

01:28:00.900 --> 01:28:02.652
There, I said it. Are you happy now?

01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:05.905
Now, I'm gonna walk out
that back door...

01:28:06.072 --> 01:28:09.867
...and you ain't gonna
see me no more. Ever.

01:28:10.868 --> 01:28:12.620
-But--
-Oh, it hurts.

01:28:12.787 --> 01:28:14.622
-We--
-I know.

01:28:14.789 --> 01:28:16.291
We'll never see each other again.

01:28:16.457 --> 01:28:18.751
-But we--
-Maybe that's for the best.

01:28:18.918 --> 01:28:20.086
You'll start a family...

01:28:20.253 --> 01:28:23.172
...and you won't need
a lowlife criminal like...

01:28:23.339 --> 01:28:25.174
...Calvin Sims around anymore.

01:28:25.341 --> 01:28:28.886
Actually what I was gonna say is,
we don't have a back door.

01:28:29.053 --> 01:28:31.389
Okay, well, then I'll go out the front.

01:28:32.265 --> 01:28:34.809
-Fine.
-Well....

01:28:35.393 --> 01:28:39.814
I'll be out of your lives for good,
never to return again.

01:28:40.398 --> 01:28:41.983
Cool.

01:28:45.570 --> 01:28:46.988
So long.

01:28:47.155 --> 01:28:50.700
Farewell. Oh, God.

01:28:53.745 --> 01:28:57.081
Aren't you gonna miss me?
Just a little bit?

01:28:57.248 --> 01:29:00.752
-See you around, buddy.
-No?

01:29:01.336 --> 01:29:02.545
Take care.

01:29:03.046 --> 01:29:04.672
Goodbye.

01:29:04.839 --> 01:29:10.053
It's so hard to say goodbye

01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:26.527
Why?

01:29:27.320 --> 01:29:31.449
Nobody loves Calvin.

01:29:31.616 --> 01:29:33.618
Because I'm short.

01:29:34.619 --> 01:29:37.705
-They think I'm ugly.
-Hey, little man.

01:29:38.623 --> 01:29:40.291
Wanna share a glass of milk?

01:29:50.301 --> 01:29:53.096
Enough of all this girlie stuff.
This ain't Brokeback Mountain.

01:29:54.222 --> 01:29:56.808
Hey, how about we put a little
bit of liquor in that milk?

01:29:56.974 --> 01:29:58.768
Forget that. Let's go to a bar.

01:29:58.935 --> 01:30:00.103
All right. Bet.

01:30:00.269 --> 01:30:02.772
-Are you over 21 ?
-And then some.

01:30:02.980 --> 01:30:04.482
All right.

01:30:06.734 --> 01:30:08.861
Hey, I know this great strip club.

01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:11.239
Don't say that loud.
My wife might get mad.

01:30:11.406 --> 01:30:13.157
-Oh, sorry.
-Got change of a hundred?

01:30:13.324 --> 01:30:15.660
-No, we steal it from Pops.
-All right. All singles.

01:30:29.090 --> 01:30:31.843
You a cute little fellow.
Yes, you are.

01:30:32.009 --> 01:30:34.762
Take after your mama.
You got a lot of grandpoppy in you too.

01:30:34.929 --> 01:30:39.183
Yes, you do, little boy.
Look at the little boy.

01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:41.352
Where's the bottle?
The kid is starving.

01:30:41.519 --> 01:30:43.855
I'm coming. I'm coming. Old grouch.

01:30:44.564 --> 01:30:45.857
Here he comes, little boy.

01:30:46.023 --> 01:30:50.570
Don't worry.
We gonna get you some milk. Yeah.

01:30:50.945 --> 01:30:53.197
That little guy's so cute...

01:30:53.364 --> 01:30:55.533
...it's making me go soft.

01:30:55.700 --> 01:30:58.035
He look just like his daddy.

01:31:00.621 --> 01:31:03.124
Howdy-do, little boy.
