02:06.588 --> 02:08.907
- One minute 14, dead.
- Very good, sir.

02:09.991 --> 02:11.890
Ah! Well done lad.

02:15.126 --> 02:17.075
All right, back to your
place, Corporal Webb.

02:19.025 --> 02:21.243
Well, I think we'll call
it a day, Sergeant.

02:22.632 --> 02:23.632
Sir.

02:23.657 --> 02:24.429
Sir.

02:24.454 --> 02:25.987
Yes, Lansing, what is it?

02:26.252 --> 02:28.292
Please, sir. I haven't
had a turn yet.

02:28.608 --> 02:30.606
That's right, Lansing.
You haven't, have you?

02:31.131 --> 02:32.497
I think I should, sir.

02:33.293 --> 02:34.293
All right.

02:34.577 --> 02:36.167
Bury it again, Sergeant.

02:36.371 --> 02:37.417
All right!

02:37.472 --> 02:39.379
Come on, Lansing, move!

02:39.705 --> 02:40.887
What are you waiting for?

02:41.428 --> 02:42.428
Ah, Sergeant...

02:42.962 --> 02:45.123
Bury it somewhere he won't
take all day to find it.

02:45.153 --> 02:46.153
Thank you, sir.

02:46.969 --> 02:48.631
Awk! I told you, didn't I?

02:48.937 --> 02:51.160
We'll be the last platoon
at the cookhouse again.

02:51.302 --> 02:53.036
The food's bad enough
when it's warm.

02:53.066 --> 02:55.187
I'll give him, "Haven't
had a go yet."

03:06.304 --> 03:07.425
All ready, sir!

03:07.455 --> 03:08.690
Call him on!

03:12.992 --> 03:16.611
Well, you men should have a pretty good
idea how to use a Geiger counter by now.

03:16.641 --> 03:18.324
Remember what you've
learned here today.

03:18.966 --> 03:20.628
It could save your life.

03:20.658 --> 03:21.698
And one other thing...

03:21.923 --> 03:25.083
You've been practicing with a piece
of harmless radioactive material.

03:25.262 --> 03:28.534
If it ever comes to the real thing,
the radioactivity won't be harmless...

03:28.564 --> 03:30.747
it will be extremely lethal.
So find it, mark it...

03:30.879 --> 03:32.119
and get out of the way quickly.

03:32.454 --> 03:34.544
Leave it to be dealt with
by those that know how.

03:34.707 --> 03:36.083
Right?! That's got it.

03:36.399 --> 03:38.795
When Lansing's done his
bit, we'll call it a day.

03:43.191 --> 03:45.964
- Oh blimey, look at jet moving.
- He'll take a week to find it.

03:46.240 --> 03:47.994
Not if I can help it, he won't.

03:48.472 --> 03:49.992
Shouldn't take long, sir.

03:58.143 --> 04:00.090
- I think he's found it.
- Oh, don't be so sure,

04:00.120 --> 04:02.374
he couldn't find the
nose on his stupid face.

04:04.162 --> 04:06.130
There... what did I tell you?

04:23.289 --> 04:26.826
- Lansing... what is it?!
- I'm getting a very good reading, sir.

04:32.984 --> 04:34.310
Give me the counter.

04:34.340 --> 04:37.144
- Sergeant, fetch Major Cartwright!
- Right, sir.

04:38.959 --> 04:41.181
I knew it.
We'll be out here all night.

04:41.211 --> 04:43.373
Aye, aye, talk of the devil.

04:49.372 --> 04:50.963
Bannerman wants
to speak to you, sir.

04:50.993 --> 04:52.930
- Oh good, what is it?
- Over this ridge, sir.

05:11.573 --> 05:12.827
Mr. Bannerman?

05:14.636 --> 05:16.532
I was just coming over
to see you, Bannerman.

05:16.538 --> 05:18.072
Why haven't you got
your men moving yet?

05:18.102 --> 05:19.438
There was all the
transport back to camp.

05:19.468 --> 05:20.671
There's something wrong here, sir.

05:20.701 --> 05:22.819
We're getting a reading on the counter
where there shouldn't be one.

05:22.866 --> 05:25.399
- Oh.
- It's ah... strongest about here.

05:26.326 --> 05:29.151
- Where have you got your stuff buried?
- Over there, sir, by the tree.

05:29.778 --> 05:32.031
- All right, let's have a look.
- Lansing!...

05:32.469 --> 05:34.151
Mark this spot with my stick, will you.

05:34.181 --> 05:35.691
- Very good, sir.
- Hang on here.

05:41.859 --> 05:44.623
- Come on, Sergeant, where'd he put it?
- Somewhere around here, sir.

05:45.501 --> 05:47.142
Try the counter, Mr. Bannerman.

05:48.977 --> 05:51.210
- Haggis, do you know what?
- No, what?

05:51.240 --> 05:53.759
It's uranium, that's what it is.
It's a bloomin' uranium mine.

05:53.944 --> 05:55.864
I wonder if we'll get
a chance to stake a claim?

05:55.878 --> 05:58.086
No, not if the army get
their hooks into it.

06:10.551 --> 06:12.618
Sir? There's something
happening over here, sir.

06:12.624 --> 06:14.145
Look, just a minute, Lansing!

06:25.097 --> 06:26.097
Sir!

06:27.777 --> 06:29.457
- See to it, Sergeant.
- Right, sir!

06:29.517 --> 06:32.336
You see, sir, the reaction
couldn't possibly be because...

06:33.290 --> 06:34.637
What on earth's that?

06:34.708 --> 06:36.876
I don't know, sir.
It sounds like thunder.

06:37.610 --> 06:39.870
Sergeant, get these men dispersed!

06:39.895 --> 06:40.488
Quickly!

06:40.513 --> 06:42.969
Right! You men, you heard what he said!
Come along, all of you!

06:42.993 --> 06:45.212
Come on, jump to it!
Come along, come along, men!

06:46.900 --> 06:47.900
Lansing!

06:48.165 --> 06:50.407
Go and get that man.
He's got cloth ears.

06:53.472 --> 06:55.550
Come on, now!
Move up there!

06:56.831 --> 06:58.082
Come on, Lance.

07:00.314 --> 07:02.781
Lansing, come out of there.
Lansing!

07:23.993 --> 07:28.242
Attention, please, attention
please, will Dr. Adam Royston...

07:28.336 --> 07:30.773
...report to the Director's
office immediately.

07:31.602 --> 07:34.406
Attention, please, attention please...

07:34.431 --> 07:38.360
...will Dr. Adam Royston report to
the Director's office immediately.

07:55.721 --> 07:58.416
Cobalt, container 19.
Start your readings.

07:58.596 --> 08:00.509
2,1,1, point 5.

08:01.197 --> 08:04.689
Doctor Royston, report to the
director's office immediately.

08:05.095 --> 08:06.961
Doctor Royston, report to the
director's office immediately.

08:06.986 --> 08:10.173
Sounds like your Pa is
after Dr. Royston's blood.

08:10.455 --> 08:12.525
He'll be after mine if
he catches me doing this.

08:12.963 --> 08:13.963
Open it.

08:19.525 --> 08:21.911
It's best to be the office type...
administration.

08:24.103 --> 08:25.637
Peter... just a moment.

08:28.921 --> 08:31.567
- Where's Dr. Royston?
- He asked me to stand by, sir.

08:31.622 --> 08:32.621
So I see.

08:32.989 --> 08:35.722
He's in his workshop, it's
all right, this is purely routine.

08:35.763 --> 08:38.606
Maybe it is, but that's no reason
for you to be doing his work for him.

08:40.145 --> 08:41.611
Master data coming up.

08:49.242 --> 08:51.642
Cobalt, container 20, start reading.

08:52.060 --> 08:54.581
What is Dr. Royston
doing in that lab of his?

08:54.652 --> 08:56.985
Just an experiment.
One of his own.

10:14.320 --> 10:15.765
Safe to come in, sir?

10:16.123 --> 10:17.523
Safe to come in, sir?

10:17.857 --> 10:19.716
Oh, it's you, Russell, come on in.

10:20.959 --> 10:22.989
Stay behind the screen,
it's all radioactive.

10:25.201 --> 10:26.888
Your radio needs fixing, sir.

10:28.060 --> 10:31.153
Your radio, needs fixing,
it shouldn't make a noise like that.

10:37.517 --> 10:38.517
Radiation...

10:39.785 --> 10:43.066
The day I can cut the racket
in the radio without...

10:44.705 --> 10:46.557
...putting that stuff back in
there, then...

10:46.815 --> 10:48.596
then, that'll be clever.

10:50.432 --> 10:53.461
Now, what was it you
wanted to see me about?

10:53.500 --> 10:56.234
The director wants you up at
the establishment, sir. - Oh, no.

10:56.641 --> 10:59.062
- Well, you got a car out here?
- No, sir, I came by bike.

10:59.219 --> 11:01.952
All right, I'll walk,
I need a little exercise anyway.

11:03.063 --> 11:05.664
Said it was urgent, sir.
Seemed a bit cross you might say.

11:05.689 --> 11:08.954
Yes, I'm sure he did.
Tell him I'll run all the way.

11:13.661 --> 11:15.996
I don't care what you say, Adam.
I am in charge here.

11:16.059 --> 11:18.994
And I shall decide what you will
do and what you will not do.

11:19.831 --> 11:23.158
While we're on the subject,
I do wish you wouldn't waste Peter's time.

11:23.651 --> 11:25.564
You mean I should be
wasting my own time?

11:25.620 --> 11:26.791
That is not the point.

11:26.822 --> 11:28.627
Peter's job here
is administration

11:28.682 --> 11:30.297
Oh, I know, he want's to be a scientist,

11:30.322 --> 11:32.026
but, that's no reason for
you to encourage him.

11:32.072 --> 11:33.814
He has a great future in front of him.

11:33.939 --> 11:35.947
You must allow me to
decide what's best for him.

11:35.972 --> 11:37.641
Oh, I'm sorry, John,
I didn't think for a minute...

11:37.666 --> 11:40.532
I know you didn't, Adam,
that's just the trouble.

11:41.064 --> 11:43.032
Well, let's see it
doesn't happen again, eh.

11:43.429 --> 11:45.362
Oh, by the way,
the army has phoned it.

11:45.463 --> 11:47.625
It appears they've picked
up some radiation reaction.

11:48.127 --> 11:49.791
I'd like you to go and have a look at it.

11:50.409 --> 11:52.901
What?
I've been working on a project.

11:53.292 --> 11:56.104
- Couldn't you possibly send somebody else?
- I'm afraid not, Adam.

11:58.526 --> 12:01.195
Have a car out in front in
5 minutes for Dr. Royston.

12:17.704 --> 12:19.961
- May I see those solders now?
- Of course.

12:20.016 --> 12:22.216
There's no radioactivity there
now, there's...

12:22.469 --> 12:25.195
You're quite sure there couldn't
possibly have been some mistake?

12:25.336 --> 12:27.859
Wait to you see those men,
there's no mistake about them.

12:30.575 --> 12:33.700
Back, back... whoa!

12:38.361 --> 12:39.361
Mr. Bannerman?

12:40.150 --> 12:41.306
Just a moment, please?

12:45.025 --> 12:46.866
This chap was nearest the explosion.

12:46.952 --> 12:48.921
We thought he was just a
bit shaken up at first.

12:49.600 --> 12:51.569
Then these burns
started breaking out.

12:56.218 --> 12:58.623
- Not very pretty is it?
- No it isn't.

13:00.663 --> 13:01.686
Thank you, boys.

13:04.725 --> 13:07.022
- What about the other fella?
- He's over here.

13:07.913 --> 13:10.858
He went back to fetch that one.
He wasn't quite so near the explosion.

13:12.240 --> 13:13.844
Let's have a look at your
back, old chap.

13:22.265 --> 13:23.475
What do you make of that, hey?

13:29.688 --> 13:31.696
Were you carrying this when
the explosion happened?

13:32.227 --> 13:33.227
Yes, sir.

13:34.055 --> 13:35.055
Excuse me.

13:36.524 --> 13:37.930
- OK, Sergeant.
- All right, sir.

13:43.358 --> 13:44.358
All right, sir?

13:44.584 --> 13:46.778
- Have you finished?
- Yes, thank you.

13:46.803 --> 13:49.021
- All right, carry on, Sergeant.
- Come along, old chap.

13:52.504 --> 13:53.824
Major, I'd like to get some...

13:54.551 --> 13:56.199
...further equipment out here.

13:57.012 --> 13:58.730
I wonder now if
there's any way that

13:59.136 --> 14:00.971
that you can get a
message back to my office?

14:01.058 --> 14:03.698
Yes, I'll take care of it,
I'll send it over the air to HQ.

14:03.987 --> 14:06.471
- They'll phone it through from there.
- Good.

14:07.307 --> 14:11.041
Poor old Lance is in a terrible state.
Did you see it?

14:11.180 --> 14:15.227
Horrible. I saw a man once, fell up against
a furnace door, looked just about the same.

14:15.422 --> 14:17.648
- He's passed over the nu.
- Passed over the what?

14:17.766 --> 14:19.899
Died, screened all night he did.

14:19.924 --> 14:21.693
Hey, do you mind,
I'm just going to have my tea.

14:21.718 --> 14:24.718
Tea, we'll not be back
in time for breakfast.

14:33.354 --> 14:35.877
- Swing that light off.
- If it was so sudden, Major...

14:35.908 --> 14:39.103
How did you have time to disperse...?
- Major, you didn't answer my question.

14:39.158 --> 14:40.642
Do you think it is atomic?

14:40.666 --> 14:43.252
- Well, there certainly was radioactivity.
- What are they trying to do now?

14:43.283 --> 14:44.775
I think they're trying to sound the pit.

14:44.815 --> 14:48.041
If there was radiation, how do you
account for the absence of it now?

14:48.073 --> 14:50.604
- I don't know.
- What about those burned men?

14:50.659 --> 14:52.992
They've been taken to the hospital.
Military or civil? - Military.

14:53.026 --> 14:55.033
- This one that died, who was he?
- His name was Lansing.

14:55.081 --> 14:56.619
- A National Serviceman?
- Yes.

14:56.644 --> 14:59.339
Is there anything in the fact that the only
one who died was a National Servicemen?

14:59.364 --> 15:01.598
Good heavens man,
he was nearest the explosions!

15:01.623 --> 15:03.224
- Sir?
- Yes, Sergeant, what is it?

15:03.249 --> 15:06.014
- Dr. Royston wants to see you, sir.
- Aye, and we'd like to see Dr. Royston.

15:06.062 --> 15:07.659
I'm sorry gentlemen,
I told you once before,

15:07.684 --> 15:09.394
no unauthorized person
is allowed to approach.

15:09.419 --> 15:10.543
What right do you have....?

15:10.568 --> 15:11.568
Listen to me!

15:12.404 --> 15:14.693
You are on War Department property.
I am in charge.

15:15.139 --> 15:17.794
Either you do as I say or I shall
have you escorted from here.

15:17.819 --> 15:19.755
Do you know who...?
Gentlemen, please!

15:19.780 --> 15:22.427
- Dr. Royston's over by the equipment, sir.
- Thank you, Sergeant.

15:22.452 --> 15:23.561
Good night, gentlemen.

15:28.147 --> 15:29.693
I'm fair starved.

15:29.718 --> 15:31.905
Did you hear the sergeant tell
those newspaper fella's off a strip.

15:31.960 --> 15:34.248
It's all right for him,
he's had something to eat.

15:34.273 --> 15:36.140
What's the matter with
you, have you got worms?

15:37.569 --> 15:39.717
- You're quite certain about that?
- Yes, sir.

15:40.093 --> 15:42.287
I'm getting quite a number
of readings off the sides, but

15:42.467 --> 15:44.037
I don't think there
can be any doubt.

15:44.062 --> 15:46.397
- You want me, Royston?
- Oh, Major, yes.

15:48.062 --> 15:51.634
There's nothing more we can do out here,
I suggest that you leave a couple of

15:51.659 --> 15:55.093
men on guard, even if it's only to keep
people from stepping over the edge.

15:55.526 --> 15:57.409
No point in keeping men out here all night.

15:57.542 --> 16:01.112
I'll have the area roped off and put
up a couple of "Keep Off" notices.

16:01.245 --> 16:03.956
Kiddo, you get things wrapped up,
and I'll wait for you in the car.

16:03.981 --> 16:04.988
What is it anyway?

16:05.245 --> 16:06.674
Have you found out
how deep it is?

16:07.042 --> 16:08.042
How deep?

16:12.808 --> 16:13.808
No, we haven't.

16:14.120 --> 16:16.760
Do you mean to tell me this
thing might be bottomless?

16:17.502 --> 16:20.268
I mean the operative range
of this equipment is limited.

16:21.150 --> 16:23.150
- Good night, Major.
- Good night, sir.

16:25.595 --> 16:28.095
How deep do you think that
fissure really is, sir?

16:28.369 --> 16:29.369
I don't know.

16:29.416 --> 16:32.689
Now, the Major was going on about it being
bottomless, you seem to have told him.

16:32.720 --> 16:35.520
Did I? That was very
unscientific of me.

16:35.545 --> 16:37.318
We know it must have a
bottom somewhere,

16:37.343 --> 16:39.851
whatever caused that split
had to have a beginning.

16:40.007 --> 16:41.216
Had to have an end too.

16:41.326 --> 16:44.216
Well, surely the forces causing
these surface splits just disperse.

16:44.638 --> 16:48.591
Forces causing surface spits don't
burn a man to death by radiation.

16:48.662 --> 16:49.935
What are you getting at, sir?

16:50.333 --> 16:53.006
Peter, I'm not getting at
anything, I just don't know.

16:53.031 --> 16:55.023
But, for the time being,
let's assume that you're right.

16:55.048 --> 16:59.301
Let's not conjure up visions of nameless
horrors creeping around in the night.

17:07.032 --> 17:08.032
It's all clear.

17:08.806 --> 17:11.001
- They'll kill me when I get home.
- It's on mine.

17:11.173 --> 17:13.906
But we swore,
and we can not break a swear.

17:14.720 --> 17:15.720
Repeat the oath.

17:15.907 --> 17:19.984
I swear to get into the tower, and look to
see if old Tom sleeps there every night.

17:20.501 --> 17:22.642
- Are you scared?
- No.

17:22.986 --> 17:25.519
How will ya then?
Let's get it over.

17:26.743 --> 17:29.610
- You'll wait here?
- I'll wait for 5 minutes.

17:30.563 --> 17:32.763
Three minutes!
Good luck, Willie.

17:38.361 --> 17:40.228
Go on!
Make haste, Willie.

19:04.503 --> 19:05.770
What was it, Willie?

19:05.871 --> 19:06.893
What did you see?

19:09.606 --> 19:10.776
Willie, wait for me!

19:11.714 --> 19:12.714
Willie, wait!

19:13.043 --> 19:14.894
Wait up, Willie!

19:15.330 --> 19:16.541
Don't leave me!

19:17.206 --> 19:18.206
Willie, wait!

19:18.746 --> 19:19.746
Wait!

19:34.493 --> 19:36.883
- What rate, Doctor?
- Sixty drops a minute.

19:39.189 --> 19:40.189
Well?

19:42.044 --> 19:43.997
First degree radiation burns, Kelly.

19:44.419 --> 19:47.153
I thought so,
that's why I called you in.

19:57.827 --> 19:59.944
Kelly, when did he come in?

20:00.186 --> 20:03.162
About an hour ago. Perhaps you better
see the parents, they're outside.

20:03.756 --> 20:06.373
- Replaced the dressings, nurse, will you?
- Yes, Doctor.

20:09.451 --> 20:10.920
What's wrong with him, Doctor?

20:11.271 --> 20:12.152
What is it?

20:12.177 --> 20:13.920
Is there anything you can tell
us, Doctor?

20:14.286 --> 20:16.753
Well, I'm afraid it's a
little early yet, to...

20:16.810 --> 20:18.653
Your son has been badly burned.

20:18.810 --> 20:22.210
- If you could tell us how or...
- Burned, burned by what?

20:22.693 --> 20:24.427
That's what we're trying to find out.

20:24.685 --> 20:26.239
When did you first notice anything?

20:26.341 --> 20:29.505
- It was this morning.
- I went into his room to wake him up.

20:29.630 --> 20:33.059
He was lying there with those
horrible marks all over him.

20:33.240 --> 20:35.473
Well, yesterday,
what happened yesterday?

20:35.646 --> 20:37.669
- Where did he go, do you know?
- We don't know.

20:38.286 --> 20:40.864
He stopped out late with a friend of
his, Ian Osborne.

20:41.208 --> 20:42.208
Ask him.

20:42.465 --> 20:44.613
He'll be able to tell you
where they were last night.

20:59.363 --> 21:01.566
Oh, Ian, just a moment.

21:07.169 --> 21:08.738
Somebody wants to meet you, Ian.

21:13.521 --> 21:14.552
Ian...

21:15.849 --> 21:17.067
this is Dr. Royston.

21:17.092 --> 21:19.225
- Dr. Royston, this is Ian Osborn.
- How are you, Ian?

21:19.250 --> 21:20.271
Thank you.

21:20.493 --> 21:21.826
Let's sit down, Ian.

21:22.984 --> 21:27.522
Now, I've just come from visiting
your friend, Willie Harding.

21:28.163 --> 21:29.763
He's not very well, Ian.

21:30.281 --> 21:31.747
What's wrong with him?

21:32.109 --> 21:34.897
Well, you know, you and he were
out late last night, weren't you?

21:34.953 --> 21:37.358
And something must have
happened to him where you were.

21:37.492 --> 21:39.483
I'd like you to
tell me what it was.

21:41.117 --> 21:42.117
Where did you go, Ian?

21:43.281 --> 21:44.382
Where was it, Ian?

21:45.046 --> 21:46.313
I can not tell you.

21:46.335 --> 21:47.469
We swore an oath.

21:47.804 --> 21:48.804
Willie is sick.

21:49.734 --> 21:51.067
He's very sick, Ian.

21:51.413 --> 21:54.522
I can't, I can't, we swore an oath.

21:55.093 --> 21:59.202
Yes, yes, but that was when Willie
was fit and healthy, wasn't it?

22:01.343 --> 22:02.343
Wasn't it?

22:03.285 --> 22:06.784
Now that he's sick, see, that's
different, he'd want you to tell.

22:07.511 --> 22:08.511
Are you sure?

22:08.996 --> 22:09.996
I'm very sure.

22:11.527 --> 22:14.440
Well, we went out to the
tower in the marshes.

22:14.846 --> 22:16.313
It was awfully creepy.

22:16.721 --> 22:19.057
I dared Willie to go to the tower.

23:41.123 --> 23:43.357
Hello, anybody there?

24:14.524 --> 24:15.524
Mister.

24:17.117 --> 24:18.390
Wake up, mister!

24:19.305 --> 24:21.554
What is it... what, what, what is it?

24:27.910 --> 24:30.698
Oh! Look at the waste.

24:44.366 --> 24:47.233
- You care for a dram?
- No, no thank you.

24:47.444 --> 24:50.858
- I came out here because...
- Oh, come on man, have a dram.

24:57.501 --> 25:00.806
That container, that's mine, it came
from my workshop. Where did you get it?

25:00.853 --> 25:04.579
- This? I found it lying about...
- Don't touch it!

25:04.939 --> 25:06.517
Here man, mind what you're up to!

25:06.580 --> 25:09.564
Stay away from that!
You touch it, and it may kill you.

25:18.516 --> 25:19.531
Come in.

25:20.703 --> 25:22.437
- Good evening, sir.
- Hello, Peter.

25:25.115 --> 25:27.044
I can see what you
meant on the phone.

25:27.584 --> 25:29.786
- Is it safe?
- Unfortunately, yes.

25:39.226 --> 25:41.671
- This is lead, isn't it?
- Half an inch thick.

25:43.005 --> 25:44.674
There's a sort of...

25:44.699 --> 25:46.995
I know, I found the same
thing up at the tower.

25:47.137 --> 25:48.370
There's a towel there.

25:52.238 --> 25:54.024
You won't be able to wipe it off, Peter.

25:54.049 --> 25:55.673
It'll just disappear in an hour or two.

25:55.869 --> 25:56.869
What is it?

25:58.072 --> 26:00.251
Well, whatever it is,
it's all over the place.

26:01.079 --> 26:02.344
How do you explain it, sir?

26:02.689 --> 26:06.344
All this extraordinary damage just
to steal on old sample container.

26:07.782 --> 26:09.860
Do you know what's in that
container, Peter?

26:09.915 --> 26:10.915
It's Tritium.

26:11.423 --> 26:13.321
Don't be alarmed now,
it's completely harmless.

26:13.766 --> 26:16.454
And how long would you say
Tritium retains its radioactivity?

26:16.540 --> 26:19.094
It's not a very stable
compound, about 30 years.

26:19.212 --> 26:23.305
28 actually,
now take a radiation reading.

26:28.852 --> 26:30.922
No, the counters working all
right, here, look.

26:32.813 --> 26:34.586
Just the luminous paint on my watch.

26:34.759 --> 26:36.766
What happened, sir?
I don't understand.

26:37.930 --> 26:39.469
Peter, I'm afraid I don't either.

26:39.852 --> 26:42.096
Yesterday the material
on that container was

26:42.121 --> 26:44.141
giving a danger point
radiation reading.

26:44.166 --> 26:46.922
- Now as you just saw, it's nothing.
- But that's impossible!

26:47.900 --> 26:48.900
Isn't it?

26:49.182 --> 26:53.009
Yesterday I would have said yes,
but this fact is inescapable.

26:53.385 --> 26:56.431
The energy trapped in that Tritium
has been sucked right out of it.

26:56.463 --> 27:00.509
And furthermore, these windows were
barred and that door was locked all night.

27:01.118 --> 27:03.336
So, whoever it was came in here must be...

27:04.017 --> 27:05.017
most unusual.

27:06.071 --> 27:07.671
- Really, Inspector McGill.
- Tristen.

27:07.954 --> 27:10.883
I'm sorry, but the whole
thing's quite ridiculous.

27:11.321 --> 27:13.782
I never thought anyone would
call you people in on this.

27:13.907 --> 27:15.462
The local police called us.

27:15.634 --> 27:18.277
As you know, sir, any crime,
however small, connected with

27:18.302 --> 27:20.720
this establishment,
automatically comes through to us.

27:20.745 --> 27:21.618
Quite possibly,

27:21.643 --> 27:22.698
but this crime,

27:22.722 --> 27:23.518
if you can call it that,

27:23.543 --> 27:25.268
has nothing to do with
the establishment.

27:25.387 --> 27:28.389
This tin can was stole from
Dr. Royston's own workshop,

27:28.414 --> 27:30.075
it's purely a personal matter.

27:30.546 --> 27:31.556
I should have thought
the local police

27:31.581 --> 27:33.164
were well able to
take care of that.

27:33.511 --> 27:36.471
As for the story of Dr. Royston's
about the tin containing some...

27:36.714 --> 27:38.530
...radioactive material.
Well, I've spoke to the doctor about that,

27:38.555 --> 27:40.183
and I don't want to hear anymore
about the matter, thank you.

27:41.078 --> 27:42.145
Well, I do, sir.

27:43.203 --> 27:45.539
So, perhaps you can tell me
where I can find Dr. Royston.

27:45.844 --> 27:47.377
Obviously, Inspector...

27:47.710 --> 27:48.710
...Mr. McGill...

27:48.726 --> 27:50.664
If you place any credence in this
story, you don't

27:50.689 --> 27:52.778
know the first thing about
the basic facts of science.

27:53.095 --> 27:54.930
- Now, let me...
- Dr. Royston does.

27:55.189 --> 27:58.789
- Does what?
- Know about the basic fact of science.

27:59.189 --> 28:01.243
Look here, sir,
I've been sent up here to...

28:01.392 --> 28:02.923
...pursue an investigation.

28:02.978 --> 28:04.883
Perhaps you'll allow
me to do just that.

28:05.142 --> 28:06.712
Where can I find Dr. Royston?

28:26.989 --> 28:28.900
Don't you chaps even stop to eat?

28:30.057 --> 28:32.220
My name's McGill,
do you mind if I sit down?

28:38.598 --> 28:42.043
United Kingdom, Atomic Energy
Commission, Internal Security Police.

28:42.598 --> 28:44.082
Sounds very impressive.

28:44.106 --> 28:46.440
Impressive, yes, except on paydays.

28:46.747 --> 28:48.949
- Well, Inspector, what can I possibly...
- Mister.

28:50.083 --> 28:52.442
OK, Mac, what can I tell you?

28:53.341 --> 28:56.207
It's about that child that was
burned, any idea how it happened?

28:57.036 --> 28:58.637
Well, not for sure, no.

28:58.662 --> 29:01.505
It's possible he may have handled
that sample container of mine.

29:01.530 --> 29:04.553
Oh, the case of the missing radiation.
Yes, I've heard about that already.

29:04.578 --> 29:06.288
- From the Director?
- From the Director.

29:06.422 --> 29:08.593
There's no doubt as to his
opinions about the matter.

29:08.961 --> 29:11.773
What about yours?
Oh, I'm not entitled to have any opinion.

29:11.798 --> 29:13.485
I'm only interested in facts.

29:13.946 --> 29:16.524
I was talking to that old
reprobate up in the tower, old Tom.

29:17.017 --> 29:18.925
One fact I did manage
to learn was that child

29:18.950 --> 29:20.650
never went near that
container of yours.

29:20.675 --> 29:22.471
He was burned by something else.

29:23.424 --> 29:26.198
Dr. Royston, I'd like you to
help me find out what it was.

29:40.338 --> 29:41.525
I'm so sorry.

29:51.423 --> 29:52.572
Oh, Willie.

30:00.635 --> 30:03.455
I expect you'd like to stay here
awhile, use my room.

30:03.533 --> 30:04.549
Thank you.

30:08.018 --> 30:09.218
The boy's parents.

30:15.132 --> 30:16.134
Is he dead?

30:16.159 --> 30:18.440
I'm afraid so,
he never regained consciousness

30:18.604 --> 30:21.229
Adam, we've got to find out
how this thing happened!

30:21.261 --> 30:23.729
- That's what we're trying to do, Doctor.
- Kelly. - McGill

30:23.776 --> 30:25.244
That's why we came
to seek for it.

30:31.368 --> 30:32.835
Dr. Royston, isn't it?

30:32.884 --> 30:35.563
- Mr. Harding, how...
- There's nothing you can say will help.

30:35.588 --> 30:37.392
I know about you, Dr. Royston!

30:37.518 --> 30:39.423
You're a scientist, not a doctor.

30:39.448 --> 30:40.705
You don't look after the sick

30:40.730 --> 30:43.573
You meddle with things that kill,
like they killed my boy in here.

30:44.370 --> 30:45.987
You should be locked up Royston.

30:46.277 --> 30:47.839
Locked up with other like you.

30:47.864 --> 30:50.012
Letting off bombs you can't control.

30:50.933 --> 30:51.933
You're not safe.

30:52.987 --> 30:54.424
You're a murderer.

30:55.050 --> 30:56.565
Mr. Harding, please.

30:57.542 --> 31:00.475
I don't know what to do.
I just don't know.

31:00.948 --> 31:01.948
My wife!

31:17.215 --> 31:19.136
I don't think he really
meant what he said, Adam.

31:19.191 --> 31:20.878
Yes, he did, Mac.
He meant it.

31:20.941 --> 31:25.875
I'm sure you know, that though it all,
we only try to create, not destroy.

31:42.917 --> 31:44.448
Two minutes?
Right.

32:19.399 --> 32:21.079
Zena, in here.

32:28.042 --> 32:30.245
Hmm, cozy.

32:31.941 --> 32:35.081
- Convenient too.
- So I've heard from the other nurses.

32:35.347 --> 32:37.050
You don't want to take any
notice of what they tell you.

32:37.066 --> 32:39.333
Oh, but I do,
that's why I'm here.

32:39.613 --> 32:41.464
What did you think
I came down for?

32:41.550 --> 32:44.659
A course of... radium treatment?

32:56.686 --> 33:00.155
Zena, darling,
why didn't we start doing this earlier?

33:00.288 --> 33:02.607
I've given you enough
encouragement, haven't I?

33:02.632 --> 33:04.226
But you should've been more direct.

33:04.523 --> 33:05.858
You should've come up and said...

33:05.905 --> 33:08.913
Harry, I want... I want...

33:10.749 --> 33:12.069
- What the?
- It switched on.

33:12.094 --> 33:13.625
Must be your electric personality.

33:19.960 --> 33:21.069
Stay here, don't move.

34:14.655 --> 34:16.647
This is where we stored the radium.

34:16.672 --> 34:17.672
Yes.

34:18.203 --> 34:20.179
Obviously, the radium was the target.

34:21.391 --> 34:23.125
Safe proved no obstacle
whatsoever, did it?

34:23.150 --> 34:25.264
What sort of heat would
be required to do this?

34:25.431 --> 34:27.603
Heat far beyond anything
we ever dreamed of.

34:28.235 --> 34:29.837
Don't forget the time element.

34:29.947 --> 34:32.212
Whatever happened in here must've
taken place in a few seconds.

34:32.237 --> 34:34.330
Perhaps we'll learn a bit more
when we can talk to the girl.

34:34.355 --> 34:35.393
Look, there's another thing, Adam.

34:35.418 --> 34:37.768
- I know, it's all over the place.
- Same as in your workshop.

34:41.456 --> 34:42.456
Any luck?

34:42.777 --> 34:45.007
I don't know if she'll recover,
but I think it would be a good

34:45.033 --> 34:47.097
thing if we got here away from
here as quickly as possible.

34:47.121 --> 34:48.876
You mean she won't be able
to tell us what happened?

34:48.964 --> 34:51.222
She won't be able to
tell you her own name.

34:53.050 --> 34:53.940
Royston?

34:55.636 --> 34:57.487
What is this?
What are we dealing with?

34:57.605 --> 34:59.655
How could anyone get in
here when there are people

34:59.680 --> 35:01.448
outside there in the
corridor all the time?

35:01.524 --> 35:03.953
Well, apparently,
this is the only place it could come in.

35:04.039 --> 35:06.586
But, the grill doesn't open,
it's cemented to the wall.

35:06.611 --> 35:09.196
- Came in through the grill.
- But, Adam, that's impossible.

35:09.299 --> 35:11.133
Whatever it was that
did all this certainly

35:11.158 --> 35:12.908
wasn't small enough
to come through that.

35:13.088 --> 35:15.642
Well, how small is
10,000 gallons of oil?

35:15.916 --> 35:16.790
What do you mean?

35:16.815 --> 35:19.892
10,000 gallons of oil would take up
a pretty large area, wouldn't it?

35:20.424 --> 35:22.273
And yet,
10,000 gallons of oil could come

35:22.298 --> 35:24.322
through the holes in that
grill, couldn't it?

35:24.829 --> 35:25.610
Yes, it could.

35:25.634 --> 35:27.883
Then, that's the way it got into my
workshop, it came in under the door.

35:27.923 --> 35:29.297
You know, obviously...

35:29.322 --> 35:31.360
this thing can take up
any shape it needs to.

35:31.385 --> 35:32.548
Where do you think it is now?

35:33.431 --> 35:34.892
Somewhere out on the ridges.

35:35.299 --> 35:37.200
Well, thank goodness
that Major didn't take my

35:37.225 --> 35:39.166
advice and station a
couple soldiers out there.

35:39.452 --> 35:40.452
But he did.

35:46.131 --> 35:47.131
Brew up!

35:55.412 --> 35:56.607
- What's that?
- Tea.

35:57.029 --> 35:58.310
You don't hear something?

35:58.881 --> 35:59.881
Like what?

35:59.936 --> 36:00.936
I don't know.

36:01.092 --> 36:02.115
Must have been...

36:04.240 --> 36:05.974
No, it couldn't have been.

36:13.393 --> 36:16.259
Hey, Spider,
there's a really great glow out here.

36:21.088 --> 36:23.080
- What is it, Haggis?
- I'm not sure.

36:23.924 --> 36:25.978
- You better go and have a look.
- Yeah.

36:27.821 --> 36:29.673
- Why me?
- Frightened?

36:30.665 --> 36:33.732
Yeah.... and I don't
mind admitting it either.

36:33.915 --> 36:35.625
You know these parts better than
me, you go have a look.

36:35.649 --> 36:36.649
I don't know these parts.

36:36.674 --> 36:39.486
- You're a Scott, ain't ya?
- Aye, but I was born 300 miles from here.

36:41.104 --> 36:43.971
Doesn't matter now,
anyhow, it's gone away.

36:44.799 --> 36:46.846
Well, I suppose I'd
better go have a look.

36:52.339 --> 36:55.003
- Keep my tea warm, Spider.
- OK.

36:56.378 --> 36:57.378
Here, Haggis...

36:58.003 --> 36:59.206
Haggis, I've been thinking...

36:59.566 --> 37:01.784
Why don't you and me go
to Glasgow on our next 48?

37:02.542 --> 37:04.120
You can show me the castle!

37:05.721 --> 37:08.057
Hey, Spider, come here, quick!
Look!

37:12.219 --> 37:13.219
Haggis?!

37:15.070 --> 37:16.070
Haggis?!

37:18.133 --> 37:19.429
What's the matter, Haggis?!

37:26.377 --> 37:27.415
What is it, Haggis?

37:28.689 --> 37:29.689
Haggis?!

37:39.364 --> 37:40.520
Where are you, Haggis?

37:41.942 --> 37:42.942
Haggis?

38:37.338 --> 38:38.338
Guard?!

38:40.979 --> 38:41.979
Guard!

38:44.474 --> 38:45.701
Looks like we're too late.

39:22.449 --> 39:24.094
I suggested this meeting
because I think I

39:24.119 --> 39:25.840
have an idea of what
we may be dealing with.

39:26.143 --> 39:28.056
Perhaps one of you
may have a solution.

39:28.127 --> 39:30.330
Then again, perhaps one of
you may think I'm talking a

39:30.355 --> 39:32.596
lot of nonsense and can offer
a more logical conclusion.

39:32.792 --> 39:35.401
What's this going to be
then, Adam, fact or theory?

39:35.644 --> 39:37.299
Partly fact, mostly theory.

39:37.324 --> 39:39.526
I see, well, carry on,
we're all listening.

39:39.972 --> 39:42.934
I'd like to resurrect for just a moment,
if I may, a treatise I did when I

39:42.959 --> 39:45.762
was a student. Which has to do with
the cooling of the earth's Surface.

39:46.051 --> 39:48.814
Hundred's of millions of years
ago, the earth was like the sun...

39:48.839 --> 39:52.120
...no form, no solidity to it,
it was just a blazing mass of energy.

39:52.253 --> 39:55.948
And then the Earth started cooling,
and as it cooled an outer crust was formed.

39:56.198 --> 39:59.557
The energy was still there, but it was
being compressed beneath this crust.

39:59.830 --> 40:02.118
As time went by, the crust grew deeper.

40:02.526 --> 40:04.959
An the compression became
greater as this vast energy

40:04.984 --> 40:07.190
was being squeezed into
an ever decreasing space.

40:07.354 --> 40:09.744
May I interrupt a moment, Adam?
What you're telling us is

40:09.769 --> 40:11.994
something every schoolboy knows.
What's it leading to?

40:12.143 --> 40:14.158
I'm sorry, maybe I should
skip the preliminaries.

40:14.182 --> 40:17.056
No, don't skip anything, Adam,
I was never very bright at school.

40:17.916 --> 40:20.377
Well, then in a comparatively
short space of time,

40:20.402 --> 40:22.862
a matter of a 100 thousand
years, man has evolved.

40:23.158 --> 40:25.523
And man has evolved from
nothing, to becoming the most

40:25.548 --> 40:27.740
intelligent creature on
the surface of this planet.

40:27.885 --> 40:30.973
Now, considering the far
greater span of time involved...

40:31.049 --> 40:32.755
...isn't it reasonable
to assume that the

40:32.780 --> 40:34.729
forces contained in the
center of this earth...

40:34.791 --> 40:36.502
...have developed an
intelligence of their own?

40:36.971 --> 40:40.025
If we accept this, we must then
consider what these forces would think.

40:40.151 --> 40:42.861
Their world is slowly being
compressed out of existence.

40:43.104 --> 40:45.767
Therefore, survival must be
uppermost in their thoughts.

40:46.362 --> 40:48.707
What's more natural in their
search for survival than that they

40:48.732 --> 40:51.002
should return to the face of the
planet where once they lived.

40:51.893 --> 40:52.893
Now...

40:53.291 --> 40:57.544
...if you check, you will find every 50 years,
by virtue of the position of the Earth in the

40:57.569 --> 41:01.683
solar system, a greater pull is exerted on the
surface of this planet than at other times.

41:01.886 --> 41:05.792
Quite unnoticeable to us,
but 2,000 miles down, who knows?

41:06.707 --> 41:09.581
And during the short period of
time that this pull is at it's most

41:09.606 --> 41:12.394
powerful, you will also find there's
always been a freak earth tremor.

41:12.441 --> 41:16.058
And that in each of these cases, a fissure
has opened in the surface of the Earth.

41:16.410 --> 41:19.647
Now, what if, on these occasions,
some of the vast energy trapped below

41:19.672 --> 41:22.863
had caused the eruptions or tremors
in an attempt to reach the surface?

41:23.290 --> 41:25.102
What if, in fact,
it did reach the surface?

41:25.525 --> 41:28.352
It looked around for a means
to sustain its existence.

41:28.798 --> 41:30.571
For to live,
one must have nourishment.

41:31.173 --> 41:34.360
And these forces are almost pure
energy, and what does energy live on?

41:34.439 --> 41:35.665
- Energy.
- Exactly.

41:36.009 --> 41:38.454
Energy can only be fed
with more energy... or...

41:39.017 --> 41:40.384
...radiation, if you like.

41:40.939 --> 41:44.646
50, 100, 150 years ago, these forces
found themselves without any means

41:44.671 --> 41:48.171
of sustenance and their mass became
unstable and they disintegrated.

41:48.218 --> 41:50.694
Now, we come to this 50 year cycle...

41:51.304 --> 41:53.437
...this time, there's radiation!

41:53.554 --> 41:55.053
There was radiation in the hospital.

41:55.562 --> 41:57.085
There was radiation in my workshop!

41:58.491 --> 42:00.702
As long as this thing feeds, it will live.

42:00.811 --> 42:02.631
And the more it lives,
the more it will grow.

42:02.795 --> 42:03.873
It's fantastic.

42:04.803 --> 42:06.623
I admit, it does sound that
way, doesn't it?

42:06.897 --> 42:09.311
But if anyone can offer a
simpler explanation of what's

42:09.336 --> 42:11.663
been going on,
I'd be grateful and relived to hear it.

42:11.858 --> 42:15.014
You're trying to tell us that some kind
of creature came up out of the fissure?

42:15.100 --> 42:17.345
Mac, I'm not trying to tell you
anything, I'm just putting

42:17.370 --> 42:19.270
forward a theory based on
the facts that we know.

42:19.295 --> 42:21.451
- So, what do we look for?
- I don't know.

42:21.842 --> 42:23.709
And what do we do if
we find something?

42:23.944 --> 42:25.420
I'm afraid I don't know that either.

42:26.030 --> 42:28.138
How big is this thing supposed to be?

42:29.077 --> 42:31.010
Might be the size of my fist.

42:31.709 --> 42:33.397
Might be as large as a house.

42:33.422 --> 42:36.318
We can't stand about here, we've got
to find this thing, and destroy it.

42:36.365 --> 42:37.365
Destroy it?

42:37.443 --> 42:39.779
How are you going to do that,
shoot it, burn it, blow it up?

42:39.804 --> 42:41.138
Listen to me, all of you!

42:41.210 --> 42:44.491
We've been told a story based on a
little fact, and a great deal of fiction.

42:44.570 --> 42:46.628
I'm amazed that this story
has been accepted by all

42:46.653 --> 42:48.632
of you without the slightest
doubt or hesitation.

42:49.320 --> 42:51.266
I said just now that I
thought the whole thing

42:51.291 --> 42:53.113
was fantastic,
I'll go further than that...

42:53.163 --> 42:54.554
...it's absolute rubbish!

42:55.054 --> 42:57.671
Dr. Royston, you're a
scientist, you deal with facts.

42:57.781 --> 43:01.171
A man of your intelligence and capabilities
has no right to talk as you have.

43:01.445 --> 43:02.445
You astound me!

43:02.569 --> 43:04.888
- What about that boy being burned?
- We've been all through that.

43:04.913 --> 43:06.350
And that business
at the hospital?

43:06.375 --> 43:08.272
There must be some perfectly
logical explanation for it,

43:08.297 --> 43:10.122
I suggest we leave the police
to find out what it is.

43:10.147 --> 43:14.622
I'm the police, in a way, and I've
come here to get Dr. Royston's advice.

43:14.647 --> 43:16.756
In that case,
I'll waste no more time.

43:16.851 --> 43:18.317
Good night, gentlemen.

43:21.683 --> 43:23.894
I'm sorry if anybody
else feels that way.

43:24.230 --> 43:26.019
Let's try and get a
look at this thing.

43:26.527 --> 43:28.628
The only way we can do
that is go to the fissure.

43:28.699 --> 43:30.441
But we've been there
more than once already.

43:30.558 --> 43:31.581
We've seen nothing.

43:31.606 --> 43:34.223
You misunderstood me. Somebody
has got to go down in the fissure.

43:48.067 --> 43:49.467
Well, all ready, sir.

43:49.497 --> 43:51.442
Peter, now, you're quite sure you
still want to go through with this?

43:51.467 --> 43:53.051
I know, we've argued this out before.

43:53.537 --> 43:55.404
After all,
I did volunteer for the job.

43:55.584 --> 43:57.784
- He's right, Adam.
- OK, Peter.

43:58.155 --> 43:59.155
Thank you.

44:00.655 --> 44:03.529
- Senior doesn't like it at all.
- Ha ha, nor do any of us.

44:03.554 --> 44:05.334
Director of the establishment’s
been on to him,

44:05.359 --> 44:06.920
told him he thinks the whole
things a waste of time.

44:06.945 --> 44:08.310
I hope you're not in any
trouble, Major.

44:08.335 --> 44:09.958
Not yet,
but I have strict orders what to do.

44:09.983 --> 44:11.521
All ready. Sir.

44:17.414 --> 44:19.187
- You're all right now, are you?
- Yes, sure.

44:19.874 --> 44:20.882
What's the drill?

44:20.905 --> 44:22.817
If there's any radioactivity
on that Geiger counter,

44:22.842 --> 44:24.429
let us know and we'll
get you out of there.

44:26.265 --> 44:27.397
Right, lower it away.

44:37.850 --> 44:38.850
Keep going.

44:40.662 --> 44:41.662
Lower.

44:44.381 --> 44:45.381
Lower away.

44:46.740 --> 44:47.740
Keep going,

44:48.261 --> 44:49.261
Lower.

44:49.542 --> 44:50.542
You all right, sir?

45:01.813 --> 45:02.813
Nothing to report, sir.

45:06.899 --> 45:07.899
Lower.

45:08.328 --> 45:09.328
Oop.

45:12.032 --> 45:14.554
- Oop, stop, stop there!
- Hold it!

45:16.625 --> 45:18.492
All right, lower away again.

45:20.071 --> 45:21.071
Stop lowering!

45:25.678 --> 45:26.943
You all right, sir?

45:27.904 --> 45:28.904
He's all right.

45:55.661 --> 45:56.661
What is it?

45:57.958 --> 45:59.879
He's all right,
but something's happening, sir.

46:04.167 --> 46:06.659
No, it's all right, keep lowering.

46:07.299 --> 46:08.299
Keep lowering!

46:13.181 --> 46:14.743
Stop! Stop lowering!

46:30.798 --> 46:32.531
Get me out of here, quick!

46:33.001 --> 46:34.274
Faster! Faster!

46:35.173 --> 46:37.706
Faster! Fast as you can!
Come on now!

46:38.790 --> 46:40.057
Bring him up, boys.

46:40.804 --> 46:41.804
Come on, boys!

46:44.020 --> 46:45.787
Faster! Heave! Faster!

46:46.997 --> 46:48.629
Crank faster!

46:59.112 --> 47:00.446
You were right, sir.

47:00.839 --> 47:02.659
There's a body of a
soldier down there.

47:02.691 --> 47:04.120
- It's all burnt up.
- What else?

47:04.167 --> 47:06.292
Well, never mind about that,
let's get away from here.

47:12.254 --> 47:13.831
Peter,
what did you see down there?

47:13.856 --> 47:14.874
I don't know what it was,

47:14.899 --> 47:17.269
it was like something out of a
nightmare, it was horrible.

47:17.371 --> 47:19.698
We'll talk about that later,
and you get in the car, Peter.

47:21.324 --> 47:22.925
I told you I had my orders, sir.

47:22.949 --> 47:24.644
They were to take action if
anything was found down there.

47:24.669 --> 47:25.801
What sort of action?

47:25.826 --> 47:28.044
Kill whatever it is,
and concrete the whole thing over.

47:28.803 --> 47:29.936
Concrete it over?

47:30.342 --> 47:32.466
- You don't mean that?
- Those are my orders.

47:41.224 --> 47:42.614
Well, Major, when do you start?

47:43.231 --> 47:44.564
Tonight, right away.

47:44.794 --> 47:46.301
- Sergeant?
- Right, sir!

48:02.595 --> 48:04.477
Well, you seem to be
making a job of it.

48:04.947 --> 48:06.970
I think this should do the trick.
What about you?

48:07.493 --> 48:10.227
You know this Royston chap,
brilliant of course, I'm sure.

48:10.251 --> 48:11.973
But the trouble with some
of these scientific types

48:11.998 --> 48:13.695
is they can't see the
easy way out of anything.

48:13.720 --> 48:15.602
It's got to be complicated
if it's going to work.

48:33.147 --> 48:34.280
Come in, come in.

48:37.224 --> 48:38.310
Hello, Mac.

48:39.349 --> 48:41.575
Where you been all day?
Here, hold this.

48:41.670 --> 48:45.169
- Down at the fissure.
- Oh, they finished down there?

48:45.194 --> 48:47.348
- What did they do, exactly?
- Practically everything.

48:47.373 --> 48:51.036
Flame throwers, high explosive,
and a neat little concrete tombstone.

48:51.185 --> 48:52.763
Rest in peace, huh?

48:52.788 --> 48:54.536
You don't think it's done any
good, do you?

48:54.561 --> 48:56.982
Well, how could it?
Let's look at the facts, you know this...

48:57.170 --> 48:58.437
Here, give me that.

48:58.608 --> 49:01.572
There's this "X", this unknown
quantity, whatever it is, has

49:01.597 --> 49:04.264
forced it's way through miles
and miles of solid rock.

49:04.529 --> 49:06.498
How's a couple feet of
concrete going to stop it?

49:06.685 --> 49:08.693
But what about the
flamethrowers and explosive?

49:08.718 --> 49:10.192
Nothing could live after that!

49:10.288 --> 49:12.553
Perhaps nothing we've ever
encountered before, but...

49:12.890 --> 49:15.483
...no, this isn't a living
organism, as we know it.

49:16.390 --> 49:19.827
It's life source may be
the same as we've got here.

49:20.374 --> 49:22.085
Stay on the side of the screen.

49:24.116 --> 49:25.116
That's good.

49:31.234 --> 49:33.867
Now, Mac, how would you
go about killing that?

49:35.117 --> 49:36.124
What is it?

49:39.273 --> 49:40.807
It's a particle of mud.

49:40.976 --> 49:43.882
And by virtue of it's atomic
structure, emits radiation.

49:44.312 --> 49:47.413
That's all it is, just mud.
How do you kill mud?

49:52.081 --> 49:54.878
Have you informed anyone
in London about all this?

49:54.995 --> 49:57.268
Hmm, no more than a half a dozen times.

49:57.425 --> 49:58.425
And?

49:58.597 --> 50:00.627
Well, at first they were
interested, but skeptical.

50:00.917 --> 50:03.229
They suggested I get in touch
with the Director about it.

50:03.628 --> 50:05.916
And later on,
the Director got in touch with them.

50:06.183 --> 50:08.401
The result is,
I've been called back to London.

50:09.034 --> 50:10.463
- When?
- Tonight.

50:10.519 --> 50:12.620
I'm catching the last
plane from Glasgow.

50:13.089 --> 50:14.955
Mac, I'm sorry to hear that.

50:14.980 --> 50:17.127
You've become one of
my staunchest allies.

50:18.566 --> 50:21.535
Adam, this thing is going to
break out again, isn't it?

50:22.199 --> 50:23.424
In my opinion, yes.

50:23.449 --> 50:25.120
Isn't there anything
we can do to stop it?

50:26.199 --> 50:27.277
I don't know.

50:27.302 --> 50:30.262
Something I've been working
on a long time now. A method of...

50:30.287 --> 50:34.802
...disintegrating atomic structure,
obviating with the sudden explosion.

50:35.873 --> 50:36.873
Well, it's...

50:37.936 --> 50:39.630
Look, what's an atomic bomb?

50:39.670 --> 50:41.623
It's a breaking up of atomic
particles, isn't it?

50:41.709 --> 50:43.902
Well, not quite, but that's close enough.
You see, I'm

50:43.927 --> 50:46.279
trying to achieve this breaking
up, without the explosion.

50:46.420 --> 50:47.420
This is a...

50:49.131 --> 50:50.464
Look, I'll show you.

50:53.624 --> 50:56.624
Now, in that lead container is
an atomically unstable compound.

50:56.882 --> 50:58.311
Two things can happen to it...

50:58.336 --> 51:02.178
Either it will continue to give off radiation
for the next 200 years, or it can be

51:02.203 --> 51:05.841
subjected to an outside force which will
disintegrate it in a fraction of a second.

51:05.866 --> 51:07.631
- A bomb, in fact.
- Well, if you like, yes.

51:07.656 --> 51:09.592
But see,
that's what I'm trying to prevent.

51:10.015 --> 51:11.415
Now, theoretically...

51:11.687 --> 51:14.452
...if you draw this stuff
between the scanners...

51:15.531 --> 51:17.701
...and adjust the scanners
to a certain pitch,

51:17.726 --> 51:19.664
a neutralizing affect
should be achieved.

51:21.312 --> 51:24.327
You mean to say that this apparatus
would neutralize an atomic bomb?

51:24.358 --> 51:26.859
- So that it wouldn't explode?
- That's my point, it couldn't.

51:26.890 --> 51:28.840
It couldn't, it wouldn't
be a bomb anymore, it would

51:28.865 --> 51:30.974
just be a handful of mud
and a very expensive casing.

51:33.537 --> 51:35.099
But, Adam, that's fantastic!

51:35.349 --> 51:37.317
A step in the right direction
anyway, isn't it, Mac?

51:37.342 --> 51:39.605
Will you be able to use this
against that thing out there?

51:39.653 --> 51:41.661
Six months time, perhaps, but...

51:43.974 --> 51:44.974
Yes, Russell, what is it?

51:45.044 --> 51:47.215
Mr. Peters sent me down to
remind you of the time, sir.

51:47.653 --> 51:49.950
Oh... yes, yes, thank you.

51:50.411 --> 51:53.223
Oh, Russell, you were able to
locate Mr. Elliott, weren't you?

51:53.262 --> 51:54.590
- Not yet, no sir.
- Oh, that's too bad.

51:54.615 --> 51:56.449
All right, thank you,
I'll be right out.

51:56.545 --> 51:58.617
We're taking the cobalt
out of the pile tonight,

51:58.642 --> 52:00.545
and we haven't been
able to locate John yet.

52:00.580 --> 52:03.376
Well, Mac, we're sure going
to miss you around here.

52:03.408 --> 52:05.165
Goodbye, Adam. Good luck.

52:36.683 --> 52:40.127
- Peter, is that truck ready?
- Yes, it's standing by outside, sir.

52:40.159 --> 52:41.794
Well, as soon as these are all
out, I want you to

52:41.819 --> 52:43.497
get a quick reading,
and then we'll load them.

52:43.522 --> 52:45.787
The pile is now inactive!

52:46.343 --> 52:47.983
The pile is now inactive!

52:48.008 --> 52:50.101
OK, boys, let's get started
and I'll get these out.

52:54.888 --> 52:57.802
No, sir, I don't. I think we have
every chance of seeing it again.

52:58.794 --> 52:59.794
Excuse me...

53:01.177 --> 53:02.716
I'm sorry, sir, the lines bad.

53:03.904 --> 53:06.317
Yes, I see.
But I only want one more night, sir.

53:06.349 --> 53:08.973
If nothing happens, I can catch
the first plane tomorrow morning.

53:08.990 --> 53:10.247
Station Sergeant speaking.

53:10.271 --> 53:11.505
Yes, of course. Aye.

53:12.240 --> 53:13.240
Aye.

53:13.693 --> 53:14.693
Where?

53:14.810 --> 53:16.210
Well, thank you, sir.

53:16.255 --> 53:18.201
Oh, there's one other thing.
I believe the Director,

53:18.226 --> 53:20.113
Mr. Elliott's got in touch
with you earlier today.

53:20.138 --> 53:22.538
You must speak up,
this phone's bad!

53:22.615 --> 53:24.466
- Oh, yes, I've seen him.
- I've got that.

53:25.661 --> 53:26.888
What about the occupants?

53:27.247 --> 53:29.458
They what?
You must be mad!

53:29.483 --> 53:31.561
No sir, he doesn't, I
know, but all the same.

53:32.264 --> 53:33.264
All right, sir.

53:33.725 --> 53:34.701
Very well, good night.

53:34.726 --> 53:36.546
All right,
I'll send somebody out right away!

53:36.999 --> 53:39.147
Williams, I want you to go
out, there's been an accident!

53:39.172 --> 53:39.969
Right, Sarge.

53:39.994 --> 53:41.242
- Thank you, Sergeant.
- Right, sir

53:41.267 --> 53:43.759
And tell McGowan to report to
me when he comes off duty.

53:43.783 --> 53:45.532
People melting, indeed.

53:46.517 --> 53:48.782
- What's that you say?
- Oh, there's been an accident, sir.

53:48.830 --> 53:49.580
Four miles from here.

53:49.605 --> 53:51.260
Yes, I know, I heard that,
but what's this about people melting?

53:51.300 --> 53:53.143
Well, that's what the man on the beat
said, I think he must be...

53:53.168 --> 53:55.550
Let me have that address.
Thank you.

54:06.174 --> 54:08.574
Hey, what do you
think you're doing?

54:08.807 --> 54:09.807
Do you hear me?

54:09.877 --> 54:12.410
I say,
what do you think you're doing?

54:14.110 --> 54:15.110
Sorry, sir.

54:27.973 --> 54:29.285
Where's the nearest telephone?

54:29.419 --> 54:31.715
The nearest public phone is
a couple of miles away, sir.

54:31.778 --> 54:34.223
But maybe one of these people
will let you use theirs.

54:34.590 --> 54:36.379
Anybody live near
here have a phone?

54:36.520 --> 54:39.910
Aye, there's a phone in my shop, half
a mile down the road. You can use that.

54:39.935 --> 54:42.263
Thanks very much.
Pop in the car, I'll drive you down.

54:46.988 --> 54:47.988
Dr. Royston?

54:50.503 --> 54:53.182
John, we've just taken the
cobalt out of the pile.

54:53.207 --> 54:54.917
- There wasn't time...
- On who's authority?

54:54.949 --> 54:56.480
Well, there wasn't really
time to check with you.

54:56.582 --> 54:59.050
You know how long it takes to
get that pile started again.

54:59.277 --> 55:01.902
You'll put the cobalt bombardment
weeks behind schedule.

55:01.949 --> 55:04.652
Entirely on you own initiative,
you break in on an official experiment.

55:05.035 --> 55:07.086
You deactivate the pile
without consulting me.

55:07.111 --> 55:08.637
This isn't your
workshop, Royston!

55:08.666 --> 55:10.884
This is a government establishment,
and I'm it's director.

55:10.938 --> 55:13.056
Look, I'm sorry,
you'll have to speak louder.

55:14.243 --> 55:17.376
No, he's busy right now,
this is Peter Elliott.

55:17.837 --> 55:18.837
Oh yes.

55:22.141 --> 55:23.141
Yes.

55:23.242 --> 55:24.406
I'll tell him, right away.

55:25.367 --> 55:27.593
Dr. Royston, it's McGill.

55:27.867 --> 55:29.914
It appears what you were
afraid of has happened.

55:29.969 --> 55:32.101
It's just killed 4 people in a car.

55:33.016 --> 55:35.820
The lines terrible,
but I think he said they'd melted.

55:39.748 --> 55:41.294
Hello, Mac, this is Royston.

55:41.435 --> 55:42.583
What's this all about?

55:43.904 --> 55:46.396
Yes, yes, wait a minute.

55:47.092 --> 55:48.092
Just a minute.

55:49.177 --> 55:50.497
Do you have a pencil, please?

55:51.842 --> 55:52.801
Go ahead.

55:52.825 --> 55:53.825
Yes.

55:54.263 --> 55:55.263
Where?

55:55.583 --> 55:57.418
Yes, right... right.

55:59.411 --> 56:00.411
Got it.

56:04.850 --> 56:06.631
Do you have a local
surveying map in your office?

56:06.656 --> 56:07.686
Yes, there's one up there.

56:07.711 --> 56:09.804
- Let's take a look at it.
- Yes, of course, come on.

56:11.045 --> 56:12.592
This point right
here is the fissure.

56:12.920 --> 56:14.295
Now, here is the hospital.

56:14.623 --> 56:16.514
This is where something
was seen glowing.

56:17.381 --> 56:20.264
Now, over here, is my workshop.

56:20.381 --> 56:23.170
If we follow this line,
right here is the old tower.

56:24.504 --> 56:27.363
You know, this thing can
obviously sense radioactivity.

56:27.535 --> 56:30.425
And once it does, nothing can stop it.
Makes straight for the radiation.

56:30.574 --> 56:32.097
And then returns to the fissure.

56:32.144 --> 56:35.105
And by these lines, it's pretty
clear it returns by the same route.

56:36.129 --> 56:39.691
Now, this latest report,
this burned out car, is right here.

56:39.832 --> 56:42.640
Now, if we extend the line from
the fissure through this point,

56:42.665 --> 56:45.121
somewhere along this extended
line is where it's headed.

56:45.827 --> 56:47.287
- I see.
- Here!

56:47.421 --> 56:50.389
That's right, it's on its way for
the biggest meal of it's life!

56:56.944 --> 56:58.877
Hurry up, man, hurry
up, open the gate!

56:59.858 --> 57:02.271
- All right, all right.
- Oh, come along, man, open up the gate.

57:02.616 --> 57:04.139
- Let's see your pass.
- Oh, you know me.

57:04.170 --> 57:06.318
- Come along, open up!
- Sorry, sir, let's see your pass first.

57:07.827 --> 57:09.561
- Here.
- All right, sir.

57:16.040 --> 57:19.586
We daren't put that cobalt back in the
pile, we've got to get it out of here fast.

57:19.611 --> 57:21.944
There must be a limit to the
distance it can sense radiation.

57:21.969 --> 57:23.322
We've got to get
beyond that point.

57:23.461 --> 57:25.718
Adam,
I just wanted to say that...

57:26.484 --> 57:28.929
Oh, never mind.
I'll go and warn the security people.

57:44.775 --> 57:45.775
- Mac.
- Adam.

57:46.423 --> 57:48.188
- Any sign of it yet?
- No, not yet.

57:48.236 --> 57:49.274
It can't be far off.

57:49.478 --> 57:52.290
I've warned everybody to keep indoors.
Upstairs, if possible.

57:52.408 --> 57:54.907
I posted every man I could lay
hands on to keep watch for it.

57:55.116 --> 57:57.569
I tried to phone London again, but there's
something the matter with the lines.

57:57.594 --> 57:58.386
It's all interference.

57:58.411 --> 57:59.887
We've got the same trouble here.

57:59.919 --> 58:02.325
- Nobody's spotted a thing, huh?
- None of my men have seen anything.

58:02.349 --> 58:04.919
I'd like to know why?
A thing that big simply can't disappear.

58:04.997 --> 58:07.681
No, but it might alter it's form
and become almost invisible.

58:07.706 --> 58:08.599
Isn't that true?

58:08.624 --> 58:09.412
What's going on here?

58:09.437 --> 58:11.783
We're trying to get this
cobalt loaded and out of here.

58:13.101 --> 58:14.436
What about the gates
around this place?

58:14.476 --> 58:15.942
They're being watched.

58:15.967 --> 58:17.709
I'd like to phone around the
gates, if I may?

58:17.811 --> 58:19.029
There's a phone in there.

58:19.054 --> 58:20.803
The line isn't very good, I'm afraid.

59:08.747 --> 59:09.747
Peter!

59:10.496 --> 59:12.449
Check the main gate.
See if you can spot it.

59:23.534 --> 59:25.229
Clear this yard, boys!

59:26.242 --> 59:29.140
- Adam, what about the cobalt?
- There's nothing we can do about that now.

59:29.165 --> 59:31.039
But if it gets near, it might explode it.

59:31.064 --> 59:33.930
Then we'll be the first to explode a
cobalt bomb, now clear out of here!

59:34.079 --> 59:36.540
Boys, get out of this yard!
Come on!

59:39.352 --> 59:41.070
Hello! Wait a minute!

59:43.491 --> 59:45.858
It's the main yard gate.
Where can we see it from?

59:45.883 --> 59:47.150
Up that ladder, sir!

59:58.604 --> 01:00:01.674
Tell everyone to stay clear of the
west approach to the reactor building.

01:00:01.761 --> 01:00:03.018
It's coming in that way.

01:00:04.783 --> 01:00:07.251
Our only chance is the hope
that it absorbs radiation.

01:00:07.276 --> 01:00:09.105
Won't that make it unstable
as the cobalt decays?

01:00:09.130 --> 01:00:10.154
Yes, yes it would.

01:00:10.179 --> 01:00:11.155
Dr. Royston...

01:00:12.499 --> 01:00:13.532
...its on its way.

01:00:13.557 --> 01:00:15.219
The man on the main gate
had it just like the others.

01:00:15.244 --> 01:00:16.364
It's coming in on the west side.

01:00:16.388 --> 01:00:18.388
Look! There it is on the roof!

01:00:21.906 --> 01:00:23.539
Up there, quick!

01:00:30.822 --> 01:00:32.155
It's growing larger.

01:00:32.415 --> 01:00:35.243
The mass has to increase to
accommodate the extra radiation.

01:00:35.345 --> 01:00:36.360
How big will it get?

01:00:37.532 --> 01:00:40.133
The important thing is how
unstable is it going to get?

01:00:40.158 --> 01:00:42.398
Isn't there anything we can do?

01:00:42.423 --> 01:00:44.900
Well, we can try, but not here.

01:00:46.221 --> 01:00:49.697
The only thing we can do is to
let it go back to the fissure.

01:00:49.932 --> 01:00:51.781
Now we know the exact
route it will take so let's

01:00:51.806 --> 01:00:53.666
clear that route and get
everybody out of its path.

01:00:53.705 --> 01:00:55.813
I'll see if the army has a helicopter.
We can use that

01:00:55.838 --> 01:00:57.806
to keep a check on it,
in case it changes direction.

01:00:57.831 --> 01:00:58.963
What are you going to do, Adam?

01:00:58.995 --> 01:01:00.932
- I'm going down to my workshop.
- It's moving.

01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:22.620
Any luck?

01:01:22.645 --> 01:01:24.855
I can't hear a thing,
the static's drowning out everything.

01:01:24.911 --> 01:01:27.324
The sergeant says that's a sure
sign the thing's not far off.

01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:29.419
- Aye, let's get back to Lock Mouth.
- Aye.

01:01:46.194 --> 01:01:49.725
Come on now, hurry!
You'll be safe inside the chapel.

01:01:51.881 --> 01:01:54.756
Come on now.
Inside, hurry!

01:01:55.952 --> 01:01:59.318
- Do you need any help, minister?
- I don't think so.

01:01:59.716 --> 01:02:00.919
How near is it going to come?

01:02:00.953 --> 01:02:03.538
It should pass within a 100
yards of where you are now.

01:02:03.563 --> 01:02:04.852
Between those trees.

01:02:04.915 --> 01:02:08.180
- How much longer.
- About 2 minutes, as far as I can tell.

01:02:10.413 --> 01:02:12.741
Come on, Mrs. McGinty,
let me take your bundle.

01:02:13.304 --> 01:02:15.311
Come on, it's nice and warm inside.

01:02:16.546 --> 01:02:17.663
There you are.

01:02:39.054 --> 01:02:41.866
It's changed direction,
it's not following the same route.

01:02:43.428 --> 01:02:45.287
Plot a map the other way out.

01:03:03.033 --> 01:03:04.259
That was close.

01:03:05.932 --> 01:03:09.854
Army copter to mobile, heading out
from Loch Mouth, traveling east.

01:03:11.151 --> 01:03:13.673
Oh, what's the use, they'll never
hear anything in this static.

01:03:13.713 --> 01:03:16.017
- Are you getting all this, lad?
- Oh, yes, sir.

01:03:16.119 --> 01:03:18.548
Oh, fine, let's get over to Check Point 3.

01:03:19.479 --> 01:03:20.556
Just... there.

01:03:28.330 --> 01:03:31.752
Come on, ladies, hurry,
there is no time to lose, hurry!

01:03:32.447 --> 01:03:33.798
Inside, quickly!

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:04.760
Wait here.

01:04:25.590 --> 01:04:28.684
Every line out of this place is useless.
Radio's even worse.

01:04:28.709 --> 01:04:30.779
There's no hope of getting
through to London now.

01:04:30.804 --> 01:04:32.357
We've got to handle this ourselves.

01:04:32.382 --> 01:04:35.513
I still think that as soon as it gets to
the fissure, we ought to leave it alone.

01:04:35.538 --> 01:04:37.623
That is, until we can get
in touch with the ministry.

01:04:37.648 --> 01:04:39.875
Look, Mr. Elliott,
Adam says the larger this

01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:42.226
thing grows,
the more its range will increase.

01:04:42.501 --> 01:04:44.250
You know the next
point it will make for?

01:04:44.593 --> 01:04:48.827
There, that's it, the experimental
nuclear power station at Glen Cardiff.

01:04:48.913 --> 01:04:51.663
And to reach there, it will go right
through the center of Inverness.

01:04:51.688 --> 01:04:54.555
Now do you see, we've got to
stop this thing at the fissure.

01:04:54.774 --> 01:04:56.609
And we've got to stop it for good.

01:05:15.593 --> 01:05:17.037
- Well, Adam?
- How's it going?

01:05:17.069 --> 01:05:19.366
Not too good,
I'm just ready to try again.

01:05:19.413 --> 01:05:21.092
Watch out now, just in case.

01:06:00.557 --> 01:06:03.822
- That's it, it's worked.
- You've done it, Adam, you've done it!

01:06:04.721 --> 01:06:05.986
Adam, look!

01:06:06.479 --> 01:06:08.111
The container, it's glowing!

01:06:09.244 --> 01:06:10.710
What's happening, sir?

01:06:19.983 --> 01:06:21.649
Well, that won't do,
we'll have to try again.

01:06:21.674 --> 01:06:22.904
There's no time to try again!

01:06:23.705 --> 01:06:26.157
If a piece of material no bigger
than a pin head can cause an

01:06:26.182 --> 01:06:28.791
explosion like that can't you
imagine what would happen out there?

01:06:28.838 --> 01:06:29.845
We've got to have time!

01:06:29.870 --> 01:06:31.455
I don't care, Adam,
we've got to take the chance!

01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:33.487
We've got to try and stop
this thing at the fissure!

01:06:33.831 --> 01:06:34.831
Dr. Royston?

01:06:35.784 --> 01:06:38.690
Those scanners, they could have
slipped out of synchronization.

01:06:39.081 --> 01:06:40.276
They might have, yes.

01:06:40.402 --> 01:06:41.971
Might have been a
hundred other things.

01:06:41.995 --> 01:06:43.706
But could it have been the
scanners, Adam?

01:06:44.526 --> 01:06:45.752
Yes, yes, they...

01:06:46.245 --> 01:06:48.627
...being out of sync
might have caused it.

01:06:48.916 --> 01:06:50.877
Everything you've asked for
is at the fissure, Adam.

01:06:51.433 --> 01:06:54.112
Trucks, radioactive material...
everything's ready!

01:06:54.894 --> 01:06:57.237
Well, if that's the way it's got to
be, let's get started.

01:07:14.243 --> 01:07:15.828
Tell them to get that
copter away from here.

01:07:15.875 --> 01:07:18.117
Noise enough to wake the dead,
let alone that thing down there.

01:07:18.164 --> 01:07:19.164
Right, sir.

01:07:30.258 --> 01:07:32.466
- Is everything here, Major?
- I don't know yet.

01:07:32.491 --> 01:07:33.913
What are all these men doing?

01:07:33.929 --> 01:07:35.662
Mac, let's clear this area.

01:07:35.687 --> 01:07:37.702
Well, if anything goes wrong,
it won't matter much where they are.

01:07:37.726 --> 01:07:39.926
True, but they'll get in our way.
Now, is this our Jeep?

01:07:39.952 --> 01:07:41.249
That's it, just as you ordered.

01:07:45.569 --> 01:07:47.217
You know what you got on the
back there is bait, don't you?

01:07:47.233 --> 01:07:47.975
Yes, sir.

01:07:48.014 --> 01:07:50.100
The purpose is to entice
whatever is down there, out.

01:07:50.171 --> 01:07:52.811
Now don't you get any closer than 15
feet, you understand that?

01:07:52.850 --> 01:07:53.850
Very good, sir.

01:07:55.444 --> 01:07:56.644
Let's get started.

01:07:56.874 --> 01:07:58.412
- Have the trucks follow.
- Right.

01:07:58.467 --> 01:08:00.701
- Mr. Thomson, follow this car down.
- Right, sir.

01:09:01.143 --> 01:09:04.267
Now, Peter, don't let that Jeep
get any closer than 15 feet.

01:09:04.307 --> 01:09:06.392
- Remember that, 15 feet.
- Right, sir!

01:09:11.759 --> 01:09:13.212
Can we do anything to help, Adam?

01:09:13.642 --> 01:09:15.189
No, Mac, just keep your fingers crossed.

01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:16.734
Right, well,
we'll stay out of your way, anyhow.

01:09:16.759 --> 01:09:19.977
Major, impress upon your men the importance
of keeping these scanners in phase.

01:09:20.149 --> 01:09:22.328
As soon as we're ready,
I'll give the signal for the switch on.

01:09:22.376 --> 01:09:23.376
Right.

01:09:35.895 --> 01:09:36.911
Everything all right?

01:09:36.935 --> 01:09:38.645
Thank you, sir.
I've got the cobalt out.

01:09:38.670 --> 01:09:40.943
- I'll get the men under cover, sir.
- What's that? Yes, yes!

01:09:45.564 --> 01:09:47.040
Hold it, you lads, take cover.

01:09:47.759 --> 01:09:50.493
Come along all of you,
get your heads down behind this bank here.

01:09:53.718 --> 01:09:55.655
Come on, Dole, what are you waiting for?

01:09:56.077 --> 01:09:57.389
What's going to happen, Sarge?

01:09:57.414 --> 01:09:59.881
I'm gonna kick you head in if you don't
get it down, that's what's gonna happen.

01:10:13.095 --> 01:10:15.212
Give me the OK as soon as
you're synchronized. - Right!

01:10:17.150 --> 01:10:18.883
- You ready number one?
- Ready, sir!

01:10:20.970 --> 01:10:22.134
Are you ready number two?

01:10:23.603 --> 01:10:24.603
Ready, sir!

01:10:28.682 --> 01:10:29.689
Excuse me, Major.

01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:33.619
Peter!
Turn on the Jeep.

01:10:35.002 --> 01:10:36.269
Bring out the Jeep!

01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:52.380
Hey, what's the matter?

01:10:55.168 --> 01:10:56.809
Right, come on, get
out, I'll take it.

01:11:08.041 --> 01:11:09.041
Good luck, sir!

01:11:13.714 --> 01:11:14.971
You better take cover too.

01:11:20.522 --> 01:11:21.522
It's Peter.

01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:29.833
- What do you think you're doing?
- The drivers sick.

01:11:30.324 --> 01:11:31.973
That's no reason why
you should do it.

01:12:31.914 --> 01:12:32.981
What's he doing?

01:12:33.305 --> 01:12:34.305
Peter!

01:12:34.515 --> 01:12:36.315
Peter, don't go any closer!

01:12:37.335 --> 01:12:39.772
Peter, don't go any closer!
Peter!

01:12:41.101 --> 01:12:44.034
Peter! Peter, don't be a fool!
Get back! Get back!

01:13:45.957 --> 01:13:46.760
Peter!

01:13:46.793 --> 01:13:48.286
Peter, get out, Peter!

01:13:48.311 --> 01:13:50.278
Get out, and try to walk!

01:14:03.253 --> 01:14:04.292
All right!

01:14:04.784 --> 01:14:05.784
Switch on!

01:14:10.211 --> 01:14:11.796
- Switch on!
- Right, sir!

01:14:11.914 --> 01:14:12.914
Switch on!

01:15:15.485 --> 01:15:16.485
It's gone.

01:15:19.649 --> 01:15:20.715
Adam, it's gone!

01:15:20.914 --> 01:15:22.211
It worked, Mac, didn't it?

01:15:28.991 --> 01:15:31.358
Bring out the Geigers!
Let's have a reading!

01:15:50.650 --> 01:15:51.650
What was that?

01:15:52.658 --> 01:15:54.603
I don't know,
but it shouldn't have happened.

01:15:55.541 --> 01:15:56.941
But the thing's gone!

01:15:57.267 --> 01:15:59.470
You should be very proud, Adam.
Your theories worked!

01:15:59.595 --> 01:16:00.595
It has, Adam.
