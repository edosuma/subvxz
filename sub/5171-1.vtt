00:25.500 --> 00:29.000
<i>The Book Thief (2013)</i>

00:48.500 --> 00:50.859
<i>One small fact.</i>

00:50.860 --> 00:53.299
<i>You are going to die.</i>

00:53.300 --> 00:57.346
<i>Despite every effort,
no one lives forever.</i>

01:01.300 --> 01:04.060
<i>Sorry to be such a spoiler.</i>

01:04.061 --> 01:08.700
<i>My advice is, when the
time comes, don't panic.</i>

01:08.701 --> 01:11.063
<i>It doesn't seem to help.</i>

01:27.661 --> 01:30.300
<i>I guess I should
introduce myself properly.</i>

01:30.301 --> 01:33.300
<i>But then again,
you'll meet me soon enough.</i>

01:33.301 --> 01:35.940
<i>Not before your time, of course.</i>

01:35.941 --> 01:40.032
<i>I make it a policy
to avoid the living.</i>

01:52.941 --> 01:56.780
<i>Well, except sometimes.</i>

01:56.781 --> 02:00.269
<i>Once in a very long time...</i>

02:01.021 --> 02:03.588
<i>I can't help myself.</i>

02:04.261 --> 02:06.100
<i>I get interested.</i>

02:16.781 --> 02:21.543
<i>I don't know exactly what it
was about Liesel Meminger.</i>

02:25.421 --> 02:27.669
<i>But she caught me.</i>

02:31.261 --> 02:32.826
Mama.

02:35.901 --> 02:37.512
<i>And I cared.</i>

02:52.741 --> 02:54.545
Do you want to say a few words?

03:01.621 --> 03:03.949
Goodbye my darling

04:07.022 --> 04:10.112
She would have kept you
if she could have.

04:10.742 --> 04:13.422
You know that, don't you?

04:34.982 --> 04:37.992
Here we are. Come, Liesel.

04:39.262 --> 04:41.464
Meet your new parents.

04:42.782 --> 04:44.347
Come.

04:45.982 --> 04:47.261
Hans Hubermann.

04:47.262 --> 04:48.543
Heinrich.

04:49.982 --> 04:51.707
Heinrich.

05:12.063 --> 05:13.628
Where is the boy?

05:14.303 --> 05:15.629
He died.

05:16.263 --> 05:17.502
What do you mean?

05:17.503 --> 05:19.982
On the way here.

05:19.983 --> 05:21.902
They had to bury him by the tracks.

05:21.903 --> 05:24.742
They promised us two children,
with two allowances.

05:24.743 --> 05:26.982
Rosa, you cannot
blame the boy for dying.

05:26.983 --> 05:28.262
No, I blame his mother.

05:28.263 --> 05:30.782
Dragging them across the
country unfed, unwashed!

05:30.783 --> 05:32.182
She was running for her life.

05:32.183 --> 05:33.509
Have you seen that girl?

05:33.903 --> 05:35.382
Filthy.

05:35.383 --> 05:38.702
Everything they say about communists
is true. Dirty and stupid.

05:38.703 --> 05:41.349
I'll speak as loud as I want.

05:44.823 --> 05:46.024
Come.

05:48.383 --> 05:49.709
Come!

05:49.943 --> 05:51.827
What is the matter with her?

05:56.583 --> 05:58.706
Your Majesty.

06:08.223 --> 06:10.903
What are you brats looking at?

06:13.503 --> 06:16.991
This is Heaven Street,
your new home.

06:18.023 --> 06:21.033
Hey, lover boy! Can we get
on with the game now?

06:25.863 --> 06:27.906
Please, go in.

06:50.023 --> 06:51.907
Well, go on.

06:54.343 --> 06:55.544
What do you say?

06:58.783 --> 07:01.429
They have given us a mute.

07:03.023 --> 07:05.032
Go upstairs.

07:22.664 --> 07:23.990
Where is it?

07:26.824 --> 07:28.264
That one.

07:37.104 --> 07:38.954
It's for you.

07:44.944 --> 07:46.103
Hans!

07:46.104 --> 07:48.068
Ja, my sunshine?

08:47.384 --> 08:49.074
Good morning, Your Majesty.

08:55.824 --> 08:58.630
Would you stop that racket?

09:07.984 --> 09:10.186
What do you say?

09:11.344 --> 09:12.543
Thank you.

09:12.544 --> 09:13.870
It speaks?

09:15.864 --> 09:18.988
Now, listen, from now on
you call me "Mama," ja?

09:20.665 --> 09:22.071
Say it.

09:22.865 --> 09:24.024
Mama.

09:24.025 --> 09:25.306
Good.

09:25.905 --> 09:30.633
And that Saukerl,
that lazy pig over there...

09:31.825 --> 09:34.107
you call him "Papa."
Understood?

09:34.145 --> 09:35.346
Papa.

09:39.745 --> 09:41.384
Who is that?

09:41.385 --> 09:42.996
Who is it?

09:43.585 --> 09:45.704
Rudy Steiner, Frau Hubermann.

09:45.705 --> 09:47.111
What do you want?

09:48.065 --> 09:50.267
My mother says you've
got a daughter now.

09:50.545 --> 09:52.110
What's it to you?

09:52.745 --> 09:55.266
I'm here to take her to school.

09:55.665 --> 09:57.993
Why can't people ever
mind their own business?

09:58.905 --> 10:00.104
Hello, Rudy.

10:00.105 --> 10:01.386
Hello!

10:04.665 --> 10:07.424
And what makes you think you are
good enough for my daughter?

10:07.425 --> 10:08.626
Rudy.

10:09.945 --> 10:11.635
I'm almost 12.

10:12.825 --> 10:15.864
Liesel, eat your soup
and go and get dressed.

10:15.865 --> 10:18.830
Stay outside, you filthy Saukerl.

10:21.625 --> 10:23.236
Hurry up, Liesel.

10:28.505 --> 10:29.945
Do you like to run?

10:32.865 --> 10:34.988
I bet I could beat you.

10:35.265 --> 10:37.832
No one has ever
beaten me in a race.

10:42.745 --> 10:45.073
You don't say much, do you?

10:48.425 --> 10:51.834
Is that one spit, "Yes,"
and two spits, "No"?

10:54.865 --> 10:56.510
I'm glad we
understand each other.

10:57.545 --> 11:01.545
My mother didn't really tell
me to come and get you.

11:02.705 --> 11:06.512
I just thought
you might need a friend.

11:16.665 --> 11:18.867
<i>Danke sch√∂n!</i>
Rudy!

11:20.785 --> 11:22.316
What are you up to?

11:22.385 --> 11:23.705
Nothing, Papa.

11:23.706 --> 11:25.225
Then get to school.

11:41.786 --> 11:43.317
Come on.

11:52.106 --> 11:53.432
You are?

11:56.746 --> 11:58.550
Frau Hubermann's new daughter.

11:58.746 --> 12:00.869
I was not addressing you, Steiner.

12:02.306 --> 12:04.395
Girl, speak.

12:06.186 --> 12:07.672
Liesel Meminger.

12:09.066 --> 12:10.916
Chalk, board, name.

12:14.466 --> 12:17.112
Come, girl.
We don't have all day.

12:22.666 --> 12:24.197
Write it.

12:34.786 --> 12:36.147
Silence.

12:40.746 --> 12:42.471
Silence!

12:42.586 --> 12:45.357
Back to your seat, now.

12:50.106 --> 12:51.831
Silence.

12:55.106 --> 12:59.789
<i>Dummkopf!
Dummkopf! Dummkopf!</i>

13:05.186 --> 13:08.225
Hey, Dummkopf.
Can't you even read yet?

13:08.226 --> 13:11.105
Go on. Read one word.
Read something.

13:11.106 --> 13:12.467
<i>Dummkopf.</i>

13:27.946 --> 13:29.148
She's killing him!

13:44.747 --> 13:46.756
I bet that wasn't your first fight.

13:47.267 --> 13:49.586
Franz Deutscher hasn't
been hit like that...

13:49.587 --> 13:52.306
since he peed in
Tommy Muller's lunchbox.

13:52.307 --> 13:55.386
Franz Deutscher
doesn't sound very smart.

13:55.387 --> 13:57.715
He's the dumbest kid in school.

13:58.187 --> 13:59.434
But he shaves.

14:01.107 --> 14:02.986
You remember how to get home?

14:02.987 --> 14:05.986
Just because I can't read
doesn't make me stupid.

14:05.987 --> 14:08.428
All right.
I'll follow you, then.

14:11.747 --> 14:14.546
You could join our
soccer team, you know?

14:14.547 --> 14:18.832
Look, you should probably just
stop trying to be my friend...

14:19.147 --> 14:20.946
because I won't be
here long enough.

14:20.947 --> 14:22.387
Why not?

14:22.427 --> 14:25.346
I'm running away.
That's why not.

14:25.347 --> 14:26.826
Where to?

14:26.827 --> 14:28.791
None of your business.

14:29.667 --> 14:32.506
Well, let me know when.

14:32.507 --> 14:33.868
Why?

14:34.307 --> 14:36.316
So I can come with you.

14:36.627 --> 14:39.666
You don't understand.
I'm serious.

14:39.667 --> 14:41.386
I have to find my mother.

14:41.387 --> 14:42.626
Frau Hubermann?

14:42.627 --> 14:45.706
<i>Nein, Dummkopf.</i>
My real mother.

14:45.707 --> 14:46.826
Great.

14:46.827 --> 14:49.075
I'd like to meet her.

14:51.547 --> 14:52.786
What are you doing now?

14:52.787 --> 14:54.113
Racing you.

14:54.827 --> 14:57.792
I'll bet you a kiss I can beat you.

14:58.347 --> 14:59.548
Why would I want to kiss you?

14:59.787 --> 15:02.946
I don't know.
What does that matter?

15:02.947 --> 15:04.876
I'm the one who's going to win.

15:05.307 --> 15:07.748
Just to the end of the street.

15:09.707 --> 15:11.238
And what if I win?

15:11.627 --> 15:13.113
You don't have to kiss me.

15:13.147 --> 15:14.712
Ever?

15:16.587 --> 15:17.866
What do you care?

15:17.867 --> 15:20.468
You're not sticking around, right?

15:22.427 --> 15:24.356
<i>Hey! Saumensch!</i>

15:47.748 --> 15:48.995
You cheated.

15:49.188 --> 15:50.549
So what?

15:52.948 --> 15:54.559
I beat you.
Did not.

15:55.068 --> 15:56.269
It was a draw.

15:56.628 --> 15:59.187
Draw means I get the kiss.

15:59.188 --> 16:00.833
You can stick your kiss.

16:01.988 --> 16:03.189
Oh, my God.

16:03.548 --> 16:05.352
She's going to kill you.

16:07.148 --> 16:08.429
Who?

16:14.348 --> 16:16.994
If you think that I am
some kind of pushover...

16:17.348 --> 16:19.147
you are very much mistaken.

16:19.148 --> 16:20.713
Do you hear?

16:26.308 --> 16:29.079
I have just come to say good night.

16:35.468 --> 16:37.079
What is this?

16:37.988 --> 16:39.189
Is it yours?

16:48.308 --> 16:51.910
Why would a nice girl like you
want to read such a thing?

16:57.348 --> 16:59.710
Are you sure this is yours?

16:59.988 --> 17:02.395
It wasn't always mine.

17:04.188 --> 17:06.067
It belonged to my brother.

17:06.068 --> 17:07.315
I see.

17:07.548 --> 17:09.347
Your brother...

17:09.348 --> 17:12.551
his name was Pieter Strauss?

17:21.788 --> 17:23.433
Do you know what this says?

17:26.348 --> 17:27.788
Do you want to know what it says?

17:36.148 --> 17:38.750
I'm not such a good
reader myself, you know.

17:39.029 --> 17:41.755
We will have to
help each other out.

17:42.389 --> 17:43.750
<i>Ja?</i>

17:45.469 --> 17:48.149
We better get started.

17:48.549 --> 17:53.152
<i>"The Gravedigger's Handbook."</i>

17:55.189 --> 18:02.955
Raise the red flags
for German effort

18:03.029 --> 18:08.554
we want to pave the way to freedom

18:08.829 --> 18:12.920
For German effort

18:12.989 --> 18:18.639
we want to pave the way to freedom

18:18.829 --> 18:22.795
We do not create a brother pact

18:22.829 --> 18:26.670
with Jews or non-Germanics

18:26.749 --> 18:31.159
Because they falsify
the liberty certificate

18:31.269 --> 18:37.078
of Germany's people

19:21.749 --> 19:22.948
Walter.

19:22.949 --> 19:25.390
Listen, he told me
he can only take one.

19:25.789 --> 19:27.788
Take Max.
No, Mama.

19:27.789 --> 19:28.988
Take him! Go!

19:28.989 --> 19:30.228
I won't leave without you.

19:30.229 --> 19:31.430
Yes, you will.

19:31.749 --> 19:34.428
Upon your father's grave, you will.

19:34.429 --> 19:35.868
There's no time for heroics, Max.

19:35.869 --> 19:37.400
One or none.

19:37.429 --> 19:38.869
Come.

19:40.149 --> 19:41.349
The papers are inside.

19:41.350 --> 19:43.837
They don't look great,
but they'll have to do.

19:44.710 --> 19:46.196
Go find him.

19:49.270 --> 19:51.120
Forgive me.

19:57.830 --> 20:01.512
<i>When I finally caught up
with Max Vandenberg's soul...</i>

20:02.150 --> 20:04.876
<i>it was this moment
that haunted him the most.</i>

20:05.950 --> 20:08.269
<i>For leaving his mother.</i>

20:08.270 --> 20:12.191
<i>For feeling that awful,
light-headed relief...</i>

20:12.590 --> 20:15.157
<i>that he would live.</i>

20:21.030 --> 20:24.269
Jesse Owens is
the fastest man on earth.

20:24.270 --> 20:26.438
Hey, watch out, you two.

20:28.230 --> 20:29.920
What are you doing, Papa?

20:31.070 --> 20:32.431
Working, for once.

20:32.910 --> 20:35.920
I thought you painted signs,
not scraped them off.

20:37.070 --> 20:40.080
Well, the scraping-off
business is picking up, Rudy.

20:41.030 --> 20:42.391
What can you do?

20:42.630 --> 20:44.594
"Accountant."

20:45.950 --> 20:48.994
You make me proud, girl.
She's clever, Rudy.

20:49.310 --> 20:50.796
<i>Ja,</i> sir.

20:51.990 --> 20:53.476
What's an accountant?

20:53.910 --> 20:55.919
Something we will never need.

20:57.110 --> 21:00.149
"We wish you...

21:00.150 --> 21:04.719
"every success...

21:05.310 --> 21:07.672
"with your...

21:09.590 --> 21:11.789
"career...
Mmm.

21:11.790 --> 21:14.349
"In the funeral...

21:20.310 --> 21:21.789
"Business."

21:21.790 --> 21:23.355
"Funeral business."

21:24.790 --> 21:27.391
We made it.
Your first book.

21:27.950 --> 21:29.879
Congratulations.

21:33.830 --> 21:36.349
So, promise me one thing, Liesel.

21:36.350 --> 21:40.316
If I die anytime soon,
make sure they bury me right.

21:40.390 --> 21:41.751
<i>Ja?
Ja.</i>

21:41.870 --> 21:44.596
No skipping chapter six.

21:45.511 --> 21:47.201
Can we start again?

21:48.311 --> 21:50.001
Tomorrow.

21:51.071 --> 21:52.790
But it is tomorrow.

21:52.791 --> 21:54.277
You sleep now.

22:08.031 --> 22:10.040
His name was Werner.

22:20.191 --> 22:23.873
Come.
I have a surprise for you.

22:26.671 --> 22:29.070
It's very dark here.

22:29.071 --> 22:30.955
We had better turn on the light.

22:36.351 --> 22:38.076
It's a dictionary.

22:42.351 --> 22:44.633
Some of the words we have learned.

22:49.431 --> 22:51.633
Add as many as you like.

22:52.711 --> 22:54.595
It's yours.

22:57.871 --> 22:59.994
Thank you, Papa.

23:36.631 --> 23:40.230
He's done it!
He's made history!

23:40.231 --> 23:41.670
Jesse Owens...

23:41.671 --> 23:43.236
the fastest man alive!

23:43.351 --> 23:44.430
Hey!

23:45.511 --> 23:47.361
What is this?

23:51.432 --> 23:52.793
Ow!

24:02.312 --> 24:05.641
You want to remain a member?
Teach your son!

24:14.712 --> 24:16.191
Why?

24:16.192 --> 24:18.511
Why Jesse Owens?

24:18.512 --> 24:19.791
Why?

24:19.792 --> 24:21.311
He's the fastest man on earth.

24:21.312 --> 24:24.111
The fastest man on earth!

24:24.112 --> 24:25.151
The boy is crazy.

24:25.152 --> 24:27.719
- Ow! That hurts.
- Sit still, Rudy.

24:28.472 --> 24:30.871
It's even in his earholes.

24:30.872 --> 24:32.358
Barbra...

24:32.592 --> 24:34.282
Fine, you deal with him.

24:39.472 --> 24:40.991
Son...

24:40.992 --> 24:45.311
you can't go around painting
yourself black, you hear?

24:45.312 --> 24:46.673
Why not?

24:48.032 --> 24:50.838
Because you shouldn't
want to be black people.

24:51.472 --> 24:52.878
Why?

24:53.832 --> 24:56.876
Because I say so. Ja?

24:58.352 --> 25:02.716
<i>"Dear Mama, today is the
Fuhrer's birthday.</i>

25:02.992 --> 25:04.876
<i>"I wish it was mine.</i>

25:05.392 --> 25:09.483
<i>"Maybe then you
could come and see me.</i>

25:09.872 --> 25:12.271
<i>"I miss you all daylong.</i>

25:12.272 --> 25:15.711
<i>"Sometimes, I think
I see you in the street.</i>

25:15.712 --> 25:18.438
<i>"But it's never you.</i>

25:20.112 --> 25:24.551
<i>"My new mama is like a thunderstorm.
Always rumbling. "</i>

25:24.552 --> 25:26.751
Hans, where did you put the flag?

25:26.752 --> 25:29.951
If we don't find it, it's going to
look like we're saying something.

25:29.952 --> 25:31.191
All right, all right, all right.

25:31.192 --> 25:33.156
I'm going to look in the basement.

25:33.752 --> 25:35.397
God in Heaven.

25:37.432 --> 25:39.711
Liesel, I know you
like it down here...

25:39.712 --> 25:42.191
but don't you think
you should be outside a bit?

25:42.192 --> 25:43.911
I'm writing Mama a letter.

25:43.912 --> 25:45.791
Well, that's very good.

25:45.792 --> 25:48.751
Please tell her, from me, I could
do without all the nagging.

25:48.752 --> 25:50.602
Not that mama.

25:52.632 --> 25:54.039
I see.

25:55.873 --> 25:57.154
What are you telling her?

25:58.433 --> 25:59.912
Everything.

25:59.913 --> 26:03.435
About you und Mama und Rudy.

26:04.913 --> 26:06.160
Can you send it for me?

26:06.953 --> 26:08.072
Well...

26:08.073 --> 26:10.401
You could give it to the woman
who brought me here.

26:10.713 --> 26:12.802
Frau Heinrich? Ja.

26:13.433 --> 26:17.115
I'm sure she would do
her best to pass it on.

26:19.993 --> 26:21.240
Ah, found it.

26:30.233 --> 26:32.832
What is she doing writing
to her mother, anyway?

26:32.833 --> 26:34.432
She's her mother.

26:34.433 --> 26:36.072
I'm not going to
waste good money...

26:36.073 --> 26:38.912
on a stamp for a letter that's
never going to be answered.

26:38.913 --> 26:40.592
What was I to say?

26:41.673 --> 26:43.637
Hans?
Alex.

26:45.273 --> 26:47.952
Good man.
Are you ready to go?

26:47.953 --> 26:49.592
Of course he is.

26:49.593 --> 26:50.632
Liesel!

26:50.633 --> 26:52.164
Come on, Liesel,
we'll miss the parade.

26:59.273 --> 27:00.884
Right.

27:01.833 --> 27:03.552
Come on, let's go.

27:03.553 --> 27:05.517
<i>Saumensch.</i>
Hello, Rudy.

27:11.553 --> 27:15.121
During this National
Socialist revolution

27:15.233 --> 27:20.360
as much as our nation prospers,
we should not decrease

27:20.793 --> 27:23.837
our determination to
cleanse ourselves morally

27:23.873 --> 27:25.996
and intellectually from within

27:27.753 --> 27:32.720
Education, theater,
films, literature, the press

27:33.073 --> 27:35.752
these are the supporting pillars

27:35.753 --> 27:40.152
which shape the unique
personality of our nation

27:42.433 --> 27:47.844
And that is why we
have gathered here tonight

27:48.153 --> 27:53.359
to free ourselves from
any intellectual dirt

28:02.874 --> 28:05.441
We will exterminate the illness

28:05.554 --> 28:09.884
that infected Germany
for the last twenty years

28:10.834 --> 28:14.322
We will completely
destroy the chains

28:14.354 --> 28:18.161
that were forged to enslave us

28:20.074 --> 28:25.804
We will fight our
enemies and if that means war

28:26.074 --> 28:30.757
then we will stand by our
Fuhrer until the final victory

28:32.954 --> 28:37.955
Such a war will see
our nation restored

28:38.434 --> 28:42.241
and bring an end to our enemies

28:43.794 --> 28:46.565
The end of plutocrats

28:47.074 --> 28:50.596
The end of communists

28:50.794 --> 28:53.759
And the end of Jews

28:55.474 --> 28:57.881
To our great German Empire

28:58.074 --> 29:02.643
and to our beloved Fuhrer,
Adolf Hitler

29:03.074 --> 29:04.753
<i>- Sieg!
- Heil!</i>

29:58.314 --> 30:00.323
Hey, Jesse Owens.

30:00.554 --> 30:01.755
Push off, Franz.

30:01.994 --> 30:03.274
Leave him alone.

30:03.275 --> 30:06.514
Did you like the speech, Dummkopf?
Were you listening?

30:06.515 --> 30:07.794
What about it?

30:07.795 --> 30:09.554
Your mother was one, wasn't she?

30:09.555 --> 30:11.883
A communist?
That's what they say.

30:12.155 --> 30:13.394
Who's "they"?

30:13.395 --> 30:14.835
You even look like one.

30:14.995 --> 30:16.514
What are you talking about?

30:16.515 --> 30:18.554
I'm not talking
to you, Steiner.

30:18.555 --> 30:20.120
She knows.

30:21.755 --> 30:23.366
Burn a book.

30:23.995 --> 30:26.084
Go on, burn a book.

30:26.235 --> 30:29.518
Go on! I'll be watching.
Both of you.

30:30.835 --> 30:33.154
What was that about?

30:33.155 --> 30:34.880
Nothing.

31:42.435 --> 31:43.636
Liesel.

31:44.155 --> 31:47.314
Where have you been? I said
to meet me at the church.

31:47.315 --> 31:48.914
Sorry, Papa.

31:48.915 --> 31:50.355
Let's go now.

32:03.435 --> 32:05.000
What is it?

32:05.355 --> 32:06.886
Nothing.

32:10.796 --> 32:12.435
Are you sick?

32:12.436 --> 32:14.638
Nein. I'm fine.

32:19.116 --> 32:20.556
Tell me, what is the
matter with you?

32:23.436 --> 32:25.320
What the hell is this?

32:26.916 --> 32:28.117
You stole it?

32:28.996 --> 32:30.197
Sorry, Papa.

32:33.116 --> 32:35.318
Are you going to tell Mama?

32:36.676 --> 32:38.082
Papa?

32:38.356 --> 32:40.320
Did anyone see you?

32:43.036 --> 32:44.886
I'll tell you what.

32:46.356 --> 32:47.887
Let's make this our secret.

32:48.316 --> 32:50.325
We'll read it like the other book.

32:50.996 --> 32:52.635
In the basement.

32:52.636 --> 32:54.361
Thank you, Papa.

32:55.076 --> 32:56.516
Good, now.

32:57.156 --> 33:00.678
We better get back before Mama worries.
We don't want that.

33:02.556 --> 33:04.440
Liesel, come.

33:11.316 --> 33:13.200
What is it?

33:17.396 --> 33:19.280
Liesel?

33:20.316 --> 33:23.963
My mother isn't
coming back, is she?

33:28.556 --> 33:29.837
Is she a communist?

33:31.756 --> 33:33.685
Who told you that?
Is she?

33:36.916 --> 33:38.720
Did the fuhrer take her away?

33:40.716 --> 33:42.515
Then I hate the fuhrer.

33:42.516 --> 33:43.922
<i>Nein.</i>

33:45.196 --> 33:47.239
You can't say that.

33:47.676 --> 33:49.719
Don't ever say that.

33:52.996 --> 33:54.277
Understand?

33:58.076 --> 33:59.357
Come.

34:02.476 --> 34:07.075
<i>"The Invisible Man</i>
by H.G. Wells."

34:07.076 --> 34:08.926
Sounds good.

34:11.757 --> 34:13.607
"Chapter one.

34:13.956 --> 34:17.001
"The Strange Man's Arrival.

34:17.717 --> 34:21.842
"The stranger came early in Feb..."

34:24.157 --> 34:26.882
"February." Ah.

34:29.317 --> 34:30.757
Good girl.

34:37.757 --> 34:39.116
Who's that?

34:40.956 --> 34:42.283
Papa, who is it?

34:53.437 --> 34:55.480
Hans Hubermann?
Ja.

34:56.117 --> 34:58.001
Do you still play the accordion?

34:58.437 --> 34:59.684
Quickly.

35:02.597 --> 35:04.208
Papa!
Liesel, go to bed!

35:04.877 --> 35:06.317
What is this?

35:07.517 --> 35:09.036
Max.

35:09.037 --> 35:10.762
No. No.

35:11.637 --> 35:13.168
Help me.

35:13.917 --> 35:15.482
We'll put him upstairs.

35:16.237 --> 35:18.405
Liesel, everything is fine.

35:19.957 --> 35:21.443
Here we go.

35:32.917 --> 35:35.119
I'll warm him some soup.

35:43.437 --> 35:45.241
Who is he, Papa?

35:49.677 --> 35:53.120
I have something very
important to tell you, Liesel.

35:54.157 --> 35:56.325
You must listen.

36:07.077 --> 36:09.325
That is not my accordion.

36:10.437 --> 36:13.607
The man who owns that accordion
is this boy's father.

36:16.598 --> 36:17.677
You stole it?

36:17.678 --> 36:19.039
<i>Nein.</i>

36:19.198 --> 36:21.207
I've been looking after it.

36:22.558 --> 36:24.362
Did he die?

36:25.518 --> 36:26.924
<i>Ja.</i>

36:28.518 --> 36:30.527
Many years ago.

36:30.838 --> 36:33.245
Before you were born.

36:36.078 --> 36:38.121
I saw him die.

36:39.998 --> 36:41.688
In a war.

36:42.198 --> 36:43.477
You were in a war?

36:43.478 --> 36:44.679
<i>Ja.</i>

36:45.398 --> 36:49.045
His father gave up his life...

36:49.358 --> 36:51.003
for me.

36:52.518 --> 36:54.717
And I made a
promise to the family...

36:54.718 --> 36:58.559
if ever I could help them, I would.
I gave them my word.

37:00.238 --> 37:03.044
Now, I need you to promise me.

37:03.678 --> 37:05.717
I need you to give me your word

37:05.718 --> 37:08.762
that you will not tell
anyone about our visitor.

37:09.758 --> 37:12.962
Nobody. Not a soul.

37:13.358 --> 37:15.401
Not even Rudy.

37:16.958 --> 37:18.808
I mean it, Liesel.

37:20.078 --> 37:22.246
Not a soul.

37:22.758 --> 37:24.687
Understand?

37:25.798 --> 37:27.077
<i>Ja.</i>

37:27.078 --> 37:31.249
A person is only as good
as their word, Liesel.

37:33.078 --> 37:34.439
Do I have yours?

37:36.118 --> 37:37.763
Ja, Papa.

37:38.758 --> 37:39.959
I promise.

38:07.398 --> 38:08.637
Did you talk to her?

38:08.638 --> 38:09.919
<i>Ja.</i>

38:11.198 --> 38:12.917
She can't tell a soul.

38:12.918 --> 38:14.529
She knows.

38:18.758 --> 38:20.848
Can we trust her?
She's our daughter.

38:20.879 --> 38:22.808
She's a child!
Rosa.

38:22.999 --> 38:25.122
We have no choice.

38:30.039 --> 38:31.843
He looks like death.

38:32.279 --> 38:34.918
He's probably forgotten
what food tastes like.

38:34.919 --> 38:36.158
What are we going to feed him on?

38:36.159 --> 38:37.720
We barely have enough
to feed ourselves!

38:37.759 --> 38:39.040
We will make do.

38:40.039 --> 38:42.287
"We will make do."

38:43.319 --> 38:46.966
We have always known
that one day this may happen.

38:56.359 --> 38:58.561
We could turn him in tomorrow.

38:59.919 --> 39:01.518
The authorities would understand.

39:01.519 --> 39:02.958
We could say
that it was late at night...

39:02.959 --> 39:04.158
Rosa.

39:04.159 --> 39:06.441
I know.
He came to us.

39:08.199 --> 39:10.686
I owe his family everything.
I know.

39:10.759 --> 39:12.723
Then, that's all.

39:13.679 --> 39:17.520
We'll just go about things
as normally as possible.

40:05.119 --> 40:06.366
Hello.

40:06.799 --> 40:08.285
Hello.

40:11.879 --> 40:14.207
What were you dreaming about?

40:14.559 --> 40:16.249
My mother.

40:18.639 --> 40:20.443
Is that your book?

40:21.439 --> 40:22.640
<i>Ja.</i>

40:23.359 --> 40:24.846
Nein, it...

40:26.280 --> 40:28.448
it wasn't always mine.

40:30.880 --> 40:32.650
Did you steal it?

40:32.840 --> 40:34.326
<i>Nein.</i>

40:35.120 --> 40:37.288
Can I see it?
It's...

40:39.080 --> 40:40.719
It's not for children.

40:42.280 --> 40:43.686
Ah.

40:44.200 --> 40:46.243
Good morning, Max.

40:48.600 --> 40:50.086
You have met Liesel?

40:50.720 --> 40:51.921
Liesel.

40:52.680 --> 40:54.245
Don't worry.

40:54.800 --> 40:56.650
She's a good girl.

41:07.320 --> 41:09.488
Not a word.

41:10.040 --> 41:12.481
Good, <i>Saumensch.</i>

41:18.680 --> 41:20.199
What's the rush?

41:20.200 --> 41:22.050
I have to get home.

41:23.120 --> 41:24.685
Race you.

41:33.160 --> 41:35.124
I have to go inside.

41:35.760 --> 41:37.883
What do you want?
My permission?

41:39.520 --> 41:40.999
Nein. I'm just telling you.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.326
Fine.

41:46.440 --> 41:48.165
<i>See you, Saumensch.</i>

41:48.320 --> 41:50.959
Where have you been?
You're late.

41:50.960 --> 41:53.162
I ran as fast as I could.

41:53.520 --> 41:55.359
And you mentioned
nothing to no one?

41:55.360 --> 41:57.324
<i>Nein,</i> Mama.
Rosa...

42:05.120 --> 42:07.402
Liesel! He's asleep.

42:26.200 --> 42:27.479
Mmm.

42:27.480 --> 42:31.128
At least someone knows how
to appreciate my cooking.

42:37.641 --> 42:40.526
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

42:53.401 --> 42:55.968
Is he going to be all right?

42:56.601 --> 42:58.371
Of course.

43:44.801 --> 43:46.924
You're a curious girl.

43:47.921 --> 43:49.160
I didn't mean to.

43:51.001 --> 43:52.885
It's all right.

44:03.001 --> 44:04.362
What is it about?

44:05.801 --> 44:07.002
Hitler.

44:08.321 --> 44:10.285
Are you hiding from Hitler?

44:10.481 --> 44:11.728
<i>Ja.</i>

44:14.521 --> 44:16.052
Are you a communist?

44:17.201 --> 44:18.482
I'm a Jew.

44:20.001 --> 44:22.010
Did he take away your mother?

44:22.521 --> 44:24.211
Probably.

44:33.602 --> 44:35.247
Don't worry.

44:35.522 --> 44:38.168
I cried a lot
when I first came, too.

44:41.602 --> 44:44.043
The soup is terrible, isn't it?

44:45.922 --> 44:48.853
You may find this
hard to believe, but...

44:49.762 --> 44:51.532
it's the best thing
I've ever thrown up.

45:10.082 --> 45:11.647
Liesel!

45:11.962 --> 45:14.290
I have a job for you.

45:22.962 --> 45:25.563
And don't forget to
count the money.

45:27.282 --> 45:28.561
Come back with the right amount

45:28.562 --> 45:31.049
or don't bother coming back at all.

45:56.482 --> 45:58.889
The <i>B√ºrgermeister's</i> house.

45:59.962 --> 46:02.130
Are you sure?

46:02.642 --> 46:05.971
Do you see any other houses
looking like this?

46:07.282 --> 46:10.645
He had dinner with the fuhrer once.

47:01.003 --> 47:02.534
Laundry.

47:03.163 --> 47:04.364
Come in.

47:08.443 --> 47:09.690
Go on.

47:45.203 --> 47:46.768
Wait.

48:08.043 --> 48:09.404
Danke sch√∂n.

48:17.603 --> 48:19.009
So, you like books?

48:33.963 --> 48:35.244
Come.

49:45.964 --> 49:48.371
<i>"The Dream Carrier."</i>

50:10.964 --> 50:12.450
Rudy.

50:14.844 --> 50:16.091
I have to go.

50:19.804 --> 50:22.843
You can come back
whenever you want.

50:22.844 --> 50:24.887
It will be here.

50:27.524 --> 50:29.374
Ja, Frau Hermann.

50:32.404 --> 50:34.723
Call me "Ilsa."

50:34.724 --> 50:36.733
What shall I call you?

50:38.124 --> 50:39.325
Liesel.

50:43.364 --> 50:45.771
You are a brave girl, Liesel.

50:59.205 --> 51:00.770
<i>Come back, Saumensch!</i>

51:00.885 --> 51:02.450
Catch me!

51:04.085 --> 51:07.287
Hey, Dummkopf! Did you hear?
England declared war on us!

51:07.313 --> 51:08.804
We're at war with England!

51:13.005 --> 51:14.616
We're at war!

51:15.565 --> 51:17.444
England declared war!

51:17.445 --> 51:23.924
<i>It's always been the same,
the excitement and rush to war.</i>

51:23.925 --> 51:26.604
<i>I've met so many young men
over the years...</i>

51:26.605 --> 51:29.764
<i>who have thought they were
running at their enemy.</i>

51:29.765 --> 51:33.651
<i>When the truth was,
they were running to me.</i>

51:47.325 --> 51:48.651
<i>Ja!</i>

51:50.445 --> 51:51.646
Excellent.

52:02.285 --> 52:04.886
You should look
where you're going next time.

52:06.605 --> 52:08.250
Drop dead, Franz.

52:09.645 --> 52:13.133
What's up, Jesse Owens?
I thought you liked being black.

52:36.285 --> 52:37.850
Who is Johann?

52:40.845 --> 52:43.935
He used to love to read.

52:45.165 --> 52:47.811
And he was brave.
Just like you.

52:50.326 --> 52:53.211
This is all him.
Everything he knew.

52:54.006 --> 52:55.537
All here.

52:56.126 --> 52:57.487
All in its place.

53:09.846 --> 53:11.775
They never found his body.

53:14.486 --> 53:18.247
If they could have shown me his
body, I would have believed them.

53:18.526 --> 53:20.967
But how can a mother give up?

53:22.526 --> 53:25.730
A mother never
gives up on her child.

53:30.206 --> 53:32.215
I have to go.

53:53.846 --> 53:56.287
Do you think my mother
really loved me?

53:57.566 --> 53:59.495
Of course.

54:01.606 --> 54:04.173
Every mother loves her child.

54:05.646 --> 54:07.575
Even Hitler's.

54:12.206 --> 54:15.330
Do you think she writes to him?

54:25.366 --> 54:26.647
"Dear fuhrer...

54:28.566 --> 54:31.485
"just wait until
your father gets home.

54:31.486 --> 54:33.495
"Love, Mama."

54:33.966 --> 54:36.605
"Dear fuhrer, clean up your mess."

54:36.606 --> 54:38.968
"Dear fuhrer, who cut your hair?"

54:39.046 --> 54:41.055
"You're not going
out in that, are you?"

54:41.606 --> 54:43.285
"What's that growing on your lip?"

54:43.286 --> 54:45.295
"Don't raise your voice at me."

54:45.326 --> 54:48.336
"Stop spitting when you yell."

55:00.327 --> 55:01.688
Hans...

55:02.487 --> 55:04.177
he's getting bedsores.

55:04.807 --> 55:07.089
Then he needs to get up
and move about.

55:07.847 --> 55:10.166
He can't just walk around.

55:10.167 --> 55:11.326
Why not?

55:11.327 --> 55:13.246
Because people will see in.

55:15.847 --> 55:19.369
He can't lay still forever.
He needs to be moved.

55:20.647 --> 55:21.848
Why?

55:22.607 --> 55:25.166
The mouth on it!
Because I say so.

55:25.167 --> 55:26.326
Rosa.

55:26.327 --> 55:28.052
And what do you propose?

55:28.287 --> 55:30.888
"Propose"?
Listen to this one.

55:31.127 --> 55:33.728
I propose that we
put him downstairs.

55:42.447 --> 55:44.775
It's not good, we know that.

55:47.527 --> 55:48.686
I'm sorry.

55:48.687 --> 55:52.526
Please don't apologize. I've
put you all in such danger.

55:52.527 --> 55:54.058
It's more than I deserve.

55:54.727 --> 55:57.578
Liesel's lessons.
It is a dictionary.

55:58.047 --> 56:00.534
I tried to make it as
comfortable as I could.

56:05.687 --> 56:07.377
I'm sorry, there's no bed.

56:08.727 --> 56:10.975
If anyone saw, you know?

56:11.407 --> 56:14.246
You feel free to do your
lessons whenever you want.

56:14.247 --> 56:16.688
Make sure you knock first.

56:19.207 --> 56:21.409
I'm just downstairs.
I'm not going anywhere.

56:22.407 --> 56:23.813
Promise.

56:49.527 --> 56:51.172
Don't give me that look.

57:04.688 --> 57:06.492
"Jellyfish."

57:06.928 --> 57:08.567
"Jellyfish."

57:08.568 --> 57:09.769
Jellyfish.

57:20.528 --> 57:23.538
Tell me, where do you
get these words?

57:26.808 --> 57:28.294
It's a secret.

57:29.848 --> 57:31.891
And who would I tell?

57:35.808 --> 57:38.329
<i>The B√ºrgermeister's wife.</i>

57:39.128 --> 57:41.535
She lets me read her books.

57:41.888 --> 57:43.931
I memorize them.

57:45.568 --> 57:48.499
"Memory is the scribe of the soul."

57:49.688 --> 57:51.128
Do you know who said that?

57:53.368 --> 57:56.094
A man called Aristotle.

57:57.488 --> 57:59.372
Can you do me a favor?

57:59.688 --> 58:02.334
Can you describe the day for me?

58:04.568 --> 58:06.930
What's it like outside?

58:07.368 --> 58:08.607
It's cloudy.

58:08.608 --> 58:09.969
No, no, no.

58:10.168 --> 58:12.257
Make the words yours.

58:14.408 --> 58:16.690
If your eyes could speak...

58:17.168 --> 58:18.893
what would they say?

58:22.408 --> 58:25.737
It's a pale day.

58:25.848 --> 58:28.369
"Pale." Good. Go on.

58:31.848 --> 58:35.211
Everything's stuck behind a cloud.

58:36.008 --> 58:38.575
Lind the sun...

58:38.928 --> 58:40.857
doesn't look like the sun.

58:41.328 --> 58:43.098
What does it look like?

58:46.008 --> 58:49.610
Like a silver oyster?

58:58.048 --> 59:00.569
Thank you. I saw that.

59:47.969 --> 59:49.978
We're hiding a Jew.

59:50.009 --> 59:52.291
Johann?

59:53.689 --> 59:55.095
<i>Nein.</i>

59:56.649 --> 59:58.135
It's Liesel.

01:00:05.809 --> 01:00:08.137
What's the meaning of this?

01:00:24.889 --> 01:00:27.490
Lind he didn't say why?

01:00:30.249 --> 01:00:32.208
I don't understand it.

01:00:32.209 --> 01:00:35.488
I've always ironed his shirts
in exactly the same way.

01:00:35.489 --> 01:00:37.688
Maybe they can't
afford it any longer.

01:00:37.689 --> 01:00:39.459
They can't afford it?

01:00:40.169 --> 01:00:41.859
We can't afford it.

01:00:45.689 --> 01:00:47.648
It's another customer gone.

01:00:47.649 --> 01:00:49.208
And four mouths to feed.

01:00:55.569 --> 01:00:56.975
Well.

01:00:57.529 --> 01:01:01.450
It's two meals a day
from now on, not three.

01:01:02.089 --> 01:01:03.700
That's all there is to it.

01:01:32.090 --> 01:01:33.655
I've made you a suit.

01:01:35.850 --> 01:01:40.180
I want you to wear it
on your 14th birthday.

01:01:41.130 --> 01:01:43.729
You'll be back then, Papa.

01:01:43.730 --> 01:01:45.534
Won't you?

01:02:54.970 --> 01:02:56.296
Hans!

01:02:56.890 --> 01:02:58.089
Rosa...

01:02:58.090 --> 01:03:00.249
I'm asking you, I'm begging you...

01:03:00.250 --> 01:03:04.819
would you please keep your
mouth shut for five minutes?

01:03:10.810 --> 01:03:12.610
I brought you something.

01:03:12.611 --> 01:03:14.650
Is this today's?
<i>Ja.</i>

01:03:14.651 --> 01:03:16.970
A gift from Franz Deutscher.

01:03:16.971 --> 01:03:20.015
That boy doesn't know
how generous he is.

01:03:20.931 --> 01:03:23.452
"Hitler poised to take Moscow."

01:03:27.611 --> 01:03:29.893
The world has turned mad.

01:03:31.331 --> 01:03:32.817
But...

01:03:33.171 --> 01:03:34.861
aren't we winning the war?

01:03:40.171 --> 01:03:41.418
Max?

01:03:48.851 --> 01:03:51.053
Where's my weather report?

01:04:05.491 --> 01:04:07.216
You're full of wonders.

01:04:09.011 --> 01:04:10.497
I've got an idea.

01:04:53.651 --> 01:04:56.092
What on earth are you doing?

01:05:04.371 --> 01:05:06.016
Go, go, go!

01:05:19.772 --> 01:05:20.973
Max.

01:05:25.012 --> 01:05:26.373
I have no more snow!

01:05:26.612 --> 01:05:28.251
Get him, Max!

01:05:28.252 --> 01:05:31.371
What in God's name are you
Saukerle doing down here?

01:05:31.372 --> 01:05:32.573
Rosa!

01:05:36.572 --> 01:05:39.901
There's a madwoman on the battlefield!
<i>Nein, nein!</i>

01:05:40.612 --> 01:05:42.416
I'm unarmed!

01:06:01.292 --> 01:06:04.931
This is the stupidest thing
that I have ever done.

01:06:04.932 --> 01:06:07.180
Lind look how happy you are.

01:06:14.052 --> 01:06:15.731
What do we do when it melts?

01:06:15.732 --> 01:06:17.331
<i>You mop it up, Saumensch.</i>

01:06:17.332 --> 01:06:20.012
It won't melt.
It's freezing down here.

01:06:20.812 --> 01:06:23.491
I don't know how
you do it every night.

01:06:23.492 --> 01:06:25.291
Please, don't think about me.

01:06:25.292 --> 01:06:27.460
Nonsense.
We all think about you.

01:06:30.332 --> 01:06:32.853
This is the best Christmas.

01:06:34.772 --> 01:06:36.861
This is my first Christmas.

01:06:37.452 --> 01:06:40.940
Now you know what you've
been missing out on.

01:06:41.532 --> 01:06:43.171
We should call it a night.

01:06:43.172 --> 01:06:45.331
Nein, Papa. Please.

01:06:45.332 --> 01:06:46.693
Listen to your father.

01:06:47.132 --> 01:06:48.771
You can stay a little longer.

01:06:48.772 --> 01:06:51.179
Oh, you're too soft on that girl.

01:06:59.212 --> 01:07:01.141
I've made you a Christmas gift.

01:07:04.012 --> 01:07:05.702
It's all I had.

01:07:21.333 --> 01:07:22.532
But...

01:07:22.533 --> 01:07:23.734
Open it.

01:07:27.053 --> 01:07:28.254
"For Liesel...

01:07:28.733 --> 01:07:30.583
"from Max."

01:07:34.053 --> 01:07:35.982
What does it say?

01:07:40.413 --> 01:07:42.024
"Write."

01:07:45.093 --> 01:07:46.932
In my religion...

01:07:46.933 --> 01:07:50.216
we're taught that
every living thing...

01:07:50.533 --> 01:07:53.012
every leaf, every bird...

01:07:53.013 --> 01:07:57.263
is only alive because it contains
the secret word for life.

01:07:59.413 --> 01:08:03.982
That's the only difference between
us and a lump of clay. A word.

01:08:06.573 --> 01:08:08.980
Words are life, Liesel.

01:08:10.613 --> 01:08:12.622
All those blank pages...

01:08:13.013 --> 01:08:14.499
they're for you to fill.

01:08:45.133 --> 01:08:47.017
My God.

01:08:51.212 --> 01:08:52.932
Is he going to die?

01:08:52.933 --> 01:08:54.452
Shut up!

01:08:54.453 --> 01:08:57.542
I won't have that talk in this
house. Do you understand?

01:08:57.773 --> 01:09:01.332
I haven't starved us all for the
better part of two years...

01:09:01.332 --> 01:09:04.184
just so that he could die.

01:09:06.453 --> 01:09:07.814
It's my fault.

01:09:08.252 --> 01:09:10.182
Why is it your fault?

01:09:10.412 --> 01:09:13.139
It was my idea
to build that snowman.

01:09:14.013 --> 01:09:16.022
Why did we build it?

01:09:17.252 --> 01:09:19.535
Because we had to.

01:09:24.133 --> 01:09:27.497
You said you weren't
going anywhere, Max.

01:09:27.814 --> 01:09:29.903
You promised.

01:09:51.214 --> 01:09:53.973
<i>"The Invisible Man...</i>

01:09:53.974 --> 01:09:56.415
"by H.G. Wells."

01:10:01.894 --> 01:10:04.904
"The stranger came
early in February...

01:10:05.374 --> 01:10:06.939
<i>"one wintry day...</i>

01:10:07.214 --> 01:10:10.975
<i>"through a biting wind
and a driving snow.</i>

01:10:11.334 --> 01:10:13.343
<i>"The last snowfall... "</i>

01:10:14.414 --> 01:10:17.424
<i>"And none other
will know of them...</i>

01:10:18.054 --> 01:10:19.779
<i>"until he dies."</i>

01:10:21.414 --> 01:10:22.945
<i>"The End."</i>

01:10:24.334 --> 01:10:26.104
Max?

01:10:34.574 --> 01:10:36.617
"Chapter One."

01:11:40.655 --> 01:11:41.856
Ilsa?

01:12:05.175 --> 01:12:08.814
<i>"The eyes in the faces he
passed on the street...</i>

01:12:08.815 --> 01:12:12.701
<i>"seemed to look inside him
and finger his guilt.</i>

01:12:13.015 --> 01:12:15.297
<i>"But things were
out of his control.</i>

01:12:16.095 --> 01:12:18.059
<i>"He had cut himself loose...</i>

01:12:18.175 --> 01:12:23.666
"and was drifting faster and
faster towards his fate.

01:12:25.855 --> 01:12:28.454
<i>"...was the dustiness
of the floor...</i>

01:12:28.455 --> 01:12:33.695
<i>"the feeling that the clothes were
more next to her than on her...</i>

01:12:34.135 --> 01:12:39.375
"and the sudden realization that
this would all be for nothing."

01:12:42.895 --> 01:12:45.097
- Did you lose something?
- Rudy!

01:12:45.895 --> 01:12:47.335
What are you doing?

01:12:47.375 --> 01:12:49.543
Spying on you, obviously.

01:12:49.615 --> 01:12:51.226
Give me that!

01:12:52.135 --> 01:12:56.385
So, let me guess. You forgot
where the front door was.

01:12:57.175 --> 01:13:00.618
I've got to hand it to you,
Saumensch, you've got guts...

01:13:00.735 --> 01:13:02.734
<i>stealing from the B√ºrgermeister.</i>

01:13:02.735 --> 01:13:04.414
Keep it down.

01:13:04.415 --> 01:13:07.061
I'm not stealing.
I'm borrowing.

01:13:07.375 --> 01:13:08.694
Whatever you are "borrowing"...

01:13:08.695 --> 01:13:10.374
I just wish you let me in on it.

01:13:10.375 --> 01:13:11.774
It's not what you think.

01:13:11.775 --> 01:13:13.254
Then...

01:13:13.255 --> 01:13:14.786
What is it?

01:13:16.215 --> 01:13:18.099
I'm borrowing books.
That's all.

01:13:18.255 --> 01:13:20.694
Books? Are you nuts?

01:13:20.695 --> 01:13:23.054
We are starving out here
and you're stealing books?

01:13:23.055 --> 01:13:24.461
Stop using that word.

01:13:24.735 --> 01:13:28.214
How about food? Did you ever even
think of looking in the kitchen?

01:13:28.215 --> 01:13:29.416
<i>Nein.</i>

01:13:29.495 --> 01:13:31.777
We could have planned this
better if you told me.

01:13:32.535 --> 01:13:34.935
I'm sorry. I couldn't.

01:13:34.936 --> 01:13:38.857
You know, for a best friend,
you keep a lot to yourself.

01:13:42.176 --> 01:13:43.980
What's that supposed to mean?

01:13:44.696 --> 01:13:46.227
Who's Max?

01:13:48.296 --> 01:13:49.577
Who is he?

01:13:50.296 --> 01:13:51.577
Liesel!

01:13:56.136 --> 01:13:58.304
Tell me what's going on!

01:13:58.616 --> 01:14:01.820
Tell me, Saumensch, who is he?

01:14:03.296 --> 01:14:05.624
Is he your boyfriend?

01:14:05.696 --> 01:14:07.307
What?

01:14:08.056 --> 01:14:09.496
Is that what you think?

01:14:09.616 --> 01:14:11.227
Then what?

01:14:11.416 --> 01:14:13.027
Tell me, who is he?

01:14:13.096 --> 01:14:14.815
I can't.

01:14:14.816 --> 01:14:16.256
Why not?

01:14:18.816 --> 01:14:20.177
It's a secret.

01:14:20.816 --> 01:14:22.347
You don't trust me?

01:14:22.736 --> 01:14:25.337
It's not like that, Rudy.
I can't.

01:14:26.296 --> 01:14:28.021
If I...

01:14:28.496 --> 01:14:32.462
If I told you, I'd have to go away.

01:14:33.256 --> 01:14:36.027
Papa would have to go away.

01:14:37.256 --> 01:14:39.857
God knows what would happen to him.

01:14:40.656 --> 01:14:42.301
"Him"?

01:14:43.656 --> 01:14:45.904
You're hiding someone?

01:14:47.336 --> 01:14:50.301
You're hiding someone, aren't you?

01:14:50.496 --> 01:14:51.857
Liesel!

01:14:54.936 --> 01:14:57.264
One spit, "Yes."
Two spits, "No."

01:15:04.376 --> 01:15:05.577
I knew it.

01:15:06.696 --> 01:15:08.978
No one can know, Rudy.

01:15:09.256 --> 01:15:10.615
I mean it.

01:15:10.616 --> 01:15:12.500
You can trust me.

01:15:13.336 --> 01:15:15.061
Don't worry.

01:15:15.376 --> 01:15:17.340
I won't tell anybody.

01:15:17.456 --> 01:15:19.465
You won't tell anyone what?

01:15:21.536 --> 01:15:24.342
Hello, Steiner.
Hello, <i>Dummkopf.</i>

01:15:26.856 --> 01:15:28.740
What's that behind your back?

01:15:28.976 --> 01:15:30.416
Give it to me.

01:15:31.616 --> 01:15:32.935
Leave him alone!

01:15:32.936 --> 01:15:34.297
I said, give it to me!

01:15:36.536 --> 01:15:37.898
Give it to me!

01:15:40.897 --> 01:15:43.376
What was that?
What was it?

01:15:43.377 --> 01:15:45.784
None of your business, Deutscher.

01:15:49.417 --> 01:15:50.664
Leave him!

01:15:56.057 --> 01:15:57.702
You're done for, Steiner.

01:15:59.257 --> 01:16:00.416
I'm reporting you.

01:16:00.417 --> 01:16:03.427
For what?
Having a diary?

01:16:03.857 --> 01:16:06.344
I know you're up to something.

01:16:14.377 --> 01:16:15.738
Come on!

01:16:23.617 --> 01:16:24.978
Come on!

01:16:27.257 --> 01:16:28.776
What are you doing?

01:16:28.777 --> 01:16:31.821
I know where it is!
I watched it!

01:16:33.097 --> 01:16:35.664
It's freezing, Rudy.
You'll die in there.

01:16:38.697 --> 01:16:40.103
Rudy!

01:16:44.297 --> 01:16:45.623
Rudy?

01:16:48.057 --> 01:16:49.338
Rudy!

01:16:51.137 --> 01:16:52.498
Rudy?

01:16:54.057 --> 01:16:56.259
Rudy, I can't swim!

01:16:56.977 --> 01:16:58.417
Rudy!

01:16:59.137 --> 01:17:00.577
Please!

01:17:03.817 --> 01:17:05.382
I got it!

01:17:06.377 --> 01:17:07.703
Rudy!

01:17:08.137 --> 01:17:09.862
I thought you were...

01:17:10.497 --> 01:17:11.698
Never mind.

01:17:12.137 --> 01:17:13.941
Trust me now?

01:17:14.937 --> 01:17:16.136
<i>Ja.</i>

01:17:16.137 --> 01:17:18.936
Then, how about that kiss?

01:17:18.937 --> 01:17:21.538
Come on.
You're going to freeze.

01:17:38.177 --> 01:17:39.976
Good night...

01:17:39.977 --> 01:17:41.781
book thief.

01:17:46.298 --> 01:17:47.943
Good night, fish.

01:18:08.658 --> 01:18:10.667
I told Rudy.

01:18:14.978 --> 01:18:17.067
Here, come on!
I'm here!

01:18:31.178 --> 01:18:32.709
Look!

01:18:35.738 --> 01:18:37.224
What are they doing?

01:18:37.338 --> 01:18:40.428
Checking basements. They checked
my cousin's last night.

01:18:41.938 --> 01:18:43.139
For what?

01:18:44.538 --> 01:18:46.706
Can we get on with it now?

01:18:46.898 --> 01:18:48.384
Come on!

01:18:49.338 --> 01:18:51.267
Here! Pass it!

01:18:54.578 --> 01:18:55.779
Are you nuts?

01:19:04.098 --> 01:19:05.299
I have to go inside.

01:19:05.418 --> 01:19:06.777
Oh, great.

01:19:06.778 --> 01:19:07.979
She's hurt.

01:19:08.098 --> 01:19:09.424
Never stopped her before.

01:19:09.898 --> 01:19:11.224
I'm fine.

01:19:19.538 --> 01:19:21.617
Mama!
Why are you shouting?

01:19:21.618 --> 01:19:22.777
They're coming.

01:19:22.778 --> 01:19:23.937
Who?

01:19:23.938 --> 01:19:25.663
They're checking basements.

01:19:33.258 --> 01:19:34.823
Hans, come quickly!

01:19:35.578 --> 01:19:36.777
What is it?
Somebody is coming.

01:19:36.778 --> 01:19:38.742
They are checking basements.

01:19:40.098 --> 01:19:41.937
We have to hide him.

01:19:41.938 --> 01:19:44.186
Get him up here, under the bed.

01:19:47.299 --> 01:19:49.098
Max!

01:19:49.099 --> 01:19:50.346
Max!

01:19:51.299 --> 01:19:52.830
Come on. Come on.

01:19:52.899 --> 01:19:56.148
So, do they give you a gun
when you join the army?

01:19:56.379 --> 01:19:57.626
Mama!

01:19:59.459 --> 01:20:00.865
Oh, my God.

01:20:01.419 --> 01:20:03.348
Hans, leave that!

01:20:10.339 --> 01:20:13.702
Wolfy. What a surprise.
How are you?

01:20:14.659 --> 01:20:16.338
You want Hans?

01:20:16.339 --> 01:20:17.618
Hans!

01:20:17.619 --> 01:20:20.338
<i>Nein, nein, nein.</i> We're just
checking people's basements.

01:20:20.339 --> 01:20:22.018
Oh, Liesel,
will you get <i>Herr</i> Edel...

01:20:22.019 --> 01:20:24.018
a glass of water?
No need.

01:20:24.019 --> 01:20:25.459
This shouldn't take a second.

01:20:28.979 --> 01:20:30.298
You should bandage that.

01:20:30.299 --> 01:20:33.178
Oh, my God, Liesel! Ja!
Oh, would you do me a favor...

01:20:33.179 --> 01:20:35.938
and get me the medicine chest?
It's just on that...

01:20:35.939 --> 01:20:37.300
Where is the man trap?

01:20:38.179 --> 01:20:39.578
The what?

01:20:39.579 --> 01:20:40.985
The door to your basement.

01:20:43.539 --> 01:20:44.618
Ah!

01:20:44.619 --> 01:20:46.298
Wolfa.

01:20:46.299 --> 01:20:48.501
I heard you were coming.
I've been working, tidying up.

01:20:50.379 --> 01:20:51.865
Heard from who?

01:20:53.019 --> 01:20:55.028
Who was it collecting our washing?

01:20:55.219 --> 01:20:56.378
Frau Schneider.

01:20:56.379 --> 01:20:59.218
Frau Schneider, ja.
She mentioned it.

01:20:59.219 --> 01:21:00.466
Come.

01:21:11.979 --> 01:21:13.498
Is there a light in here?

01:21:13.499 --> 01:21:15.269
Ja, of course.

01:21:15.579 --> 01:21:18.510
I should probably
throw most of this stuff out.

01:21:18.899 --> 01:21:22.058
You wouldn't believe what we
find in some people's basements.

01:21:22.059 --> 01:21:24.227
Oh, it wouldn't surprise me.

01:21:24.699 --> 01:21:26.858
Liesel, she is always
playing down here.

01:21:26.859 --> 01:21:29.665
I keep telling her to
get out in the fresh air.

01:21:35.819 --> 01:21:38.306
What is this about, anyway?

01:21:57.260 --> 01:21:58.461
What's this?

01:22:06.780 --> 01:22:08.061
My brushes.

01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:14.222
You should look after them better.

01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:17.299
Liesel, you know,
she never listens to me.

01:22:23.420 --> 01:22:26.100
Still no work, eh, Hans?

01:22:26.380 --> 01:22:28.070
Not a lot.

01:22:29.380 --> 01:22:32.982
You should have taken my
advice and joined the party.

01:22:33.260 --> 01:22:35.139
Then your wife wouldn't
have to break her back...

01:22:35.140 --> 01:22:37.991
washing people's
underwear to feed you.

01:22:39.980 --> 01:22:42.182
Isn't that right, Rosa?

01:22:42.980 --> 01:22:44.466
<i>Ja.</i>

01:22:45.900 --> 01:22:47.864
What's wrong with you?

01:22:49.620 --> 01:22:51.819
I've never heard you
turn down an opportunity...

01:22:51.820 --> 01:22:53.624
to give this one some lip.

01:22:55.100 --> 01:22:56.381
Well...

01:22:56.820 --> 01:23:01.708
if the Saukerl would get off
his lazy backside and help...

01:23:02.020 --> 01:23:03.659
then maybe I would have the energy

01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:06.340
to give him all the lip
that he deserves.

01:23:12.660 --> 01:23:14.908
I don't know how you live with her.

01:23:15.260 --> 01:23:16.700
Neither do I.

01:23:22.620 --> 01:23:24.982
Never too late to join, Hans.

01:23:31.020 --> 01:23:33.179
So, how's our basement?

01:23:33.180 --> 01:23:35.779
Perfectly useless.
The ceiling is too low.

01:23:35.780 --> 01:23:37.179
What for?

01:23:37.180 --> 01:23:40.065
Air raid shelters.
Every street has to have one.

01:23:40.220 --> 01:23:41.619
You should be more careful.

01:23:41.620 --> 01:23:43.151
<i>Ja, Herr</i> Edel.

01:23:53.820 --> 01:23:55.546
Hans...

01:23:58.181 --> 01:24:01.112
What if he does die?

01:24:03.341 --> 01:24:06.545
We can't just leave him there.

01:24:10.181 --> 01:24:13.191
The smell will give us away.

01:24:16.981 --> 01:24:19.627
Hans, I'm afraid.

01:24:21.741 --> 01:24:24.069
Look, if it happens...

01:24:24.581 --> 01:24:26.909
if he dies...

01:24:28.661 --> 01:24:31.307
we'll simply have to find a way.

01:24:33.261 --> 01:24:35.270
He's not dead yet.

01:24:40.141 --> 01:24:41.866
All right?

01:24:59.901 --> 01:25:01.460
Frau Hubermann?

01:25:01.461 --> 01:25:03.550
I need to speak to Liesel.

01:25:04.341 --> 01:25:06.703
Of course. Liesel?

01:25:12.061 --> 01:25:13.180
Ow!

01:25:13.181 --> 01:25:15.100
What did you do with it,
you little thief?

01:25:15.101 --> 01:25:16.140
What, Mama?

01:25:16.141 --> 01:25:17.500
Don't "what" me.

01:25:17.501 --> 01:25:19.140
I have told you a hundred times

01:25:19.141 --> 01:25:21.389
to leave that thing alone,
but do you listen?

01:25:27.061 --> 01:25:28.308
Back to work.

01:25:33.301 --> 01:25:34.866
I'm sorry.

01:25:35.421 --> 01:25:37.544
Mama, what is it?

01:25:40.061 --> 01:25:41.706
It's Max, isn't it?

01:25:49.341 --> 01:25:51.908
He said that this belongs to you.

01:25:55.261 --> 01:25:56.701
Who said?

01:25:58.661 --> 01:26:00.661
He woke up.

01:26:00.662 --> 01:26:01.861
He's going to live!

01:26:01.862 --> 01:26:03.109
Mama!

01:26:08.702 --> 01:26:09.903
Careful.

01:26:12.822 --> 01:26:15.070
I'm sorry if I hurt you.

01:26:15.422 --> 01:26:18.181
I couldn't think of
any other way to tell you.

01:26:18.182 --> 01:26:20.381
I know it's silly of me.
I know.

01:26:20.382 --> 01:26:22.461
<i>Nein,</i> Mama, it's not.

01:26:22.462 --> 01:26:23.709
Thank you.

01:26:24.302 --> 01:26:27.392
Well, you'd better wipe
that smile off your face.

01:26:28.382 --> 01:26:30.821
Just go back in there...

01:26:30.822 --> 01:26:34.708
and act like I'm the witch,
you know? Ja?

01:26:35.022 --> 01:26:36.633
<i>Ja.</i>

01:26:37.142 --> 01:26:40.107
Just know that...

01:26:42.302 --> 01:26:44.106
that I...

01:26:46.862 --> 01:26:48.188
Go on.

01:26:52.062 --> 01:26:54.469
Do you need a bit of
help with that smile?

01:27:02.342 --> 01:27:03.941
If I ever catch you...

01:27:03.942 --> 01:27:05.621
doing that sort of
thing again, so help me...

01:27:05.622 --> 01:27:07.181
I will string you up by your toes.

01:27:07.182 --> 01:27:09.461
Do you hear me, Saumensch?

01:27:09.462 --> 01:27:10.948
Understood?

01:27:36.862 --> 01:27:39.588
Max!

01:27:46.622 --> 01:27:47.869
I knew you'd live.

01:27:48.022 --> 01:27:50.702
With all that reading, you
wouldn't leave me in peace.

01:27:51.542 --> 01:27:52.821
You heard me?

01:27:52.822 --> 01:27:54.228
Of course.

01:27:55.222 --> 01:27:56.423
Thank you.

01:28:06.903 --> 01:28:08.343
So...

01:28:11.103 --> 01:28:12.953
How's Rudy?

01:28:17.863 --> 01:28:19.462
I don't know.

01:28:19.463 --> 01:28:21.870
Rudy's a pain in the neck.

01:28:25.383 --> 01:28:29.668
The only thing worse than a boy you
hate is a boy you like, right?

01:28:33.383 --> 01:28:35.426
Liesel, it's an air raid!

01:28:38.663 --> 01:28:39.864
Go on, then.

01:28:40.103 --> 01:28:41.782
What about you?

01:28:41.783 --> 01:28:44.302
I'm here. I'll be fine.

01:28:44.303 --> 01:28:46.142
It's a basement, isn't it?

01:28:46.143 --> 01:28:47.582
Did you hear me, Saumensch?

01:28:47.583 --> 01:28:48.909
Ja, Mama.

01:30:16.584 --> 01:30:22.427
<i>While 10,000 souls hid their
heads in fear and trembled...</i>

01:30:22.464 --> 01:30:26.988
<i>one Jew thanked God for the
stars that blessed his eyes.</i>

01:30:54.744 --> 01:30:55.943
It's all I have.

01:30:55.944 --> 01:30:57.270
I'm sorry.

01:30:57.624 --> 01:31:00.475
I was saving it for
my husband's return, but...

01:31:00.624 --> 01:31:02.792
Thank you. Very much.

01:31:17.744 --> 01:31:19.023
He's a Jew.

01:31:19.024 --> 01:31:20.423
They found his birth certificate.

01:31:20.424 --> 01:31:22.786
He's a "Lehman" with one not two.

01:31:23.464 --> 01:31:24.825
Please!

01:31:26.624 --> 01:31:28.588
My son is in the army!

01:31:30.024 --> 01:31:31.385
He's fighting on the front!

01:31:32.944 --> 01:31:34.343
Please.
In the car!

01:31:36.224 --> 01:31:37.710
Please!

01:31:42.104 --> 01:31:43.305
You know me.

01:31:43.584 --> 01:31:44.945
Please!

01:31:45.864 --> 01:31:47.943
You know me! Please!

01:31:47.944 --> 01:31:49.509
I'm German!

01:31:50.704 --> 01:31:51.905
Please...

01:31:51.944 --> 01:31:54.750
I've known this man my
whole life. We all have.

01:31:54.904 --> 01:31:56.515
He's a good person.

01:31:56.664 --> 01:31:57.911
What's your name?

01:32:01.384 --> 01:32:03.427
Hans Hubermann.

01:32:06.784 --> 01:32:09.112
Please! He's a good man.
Get back!

01:32:09.384 --> 01:32:10.585
Papa!

01:32:11.544 --> 01:32:12.746
Papa!

01:32:13.865 --> 01:32:15.146
Liesel!

01:32:34.665 --> 01:32:36.071
Rudy!

01:32:38.745 --> 01:32:40.106
Rudy.

01:32:49.425 --> 01:32:51.064
Keep still.

01:32:51.065 --> 01:32:53.267
What was I thinking?

01:32:54.185 --> 01:32:56.433
He took my name.

01:32:58.265 --> 01:33:01.064
Christ on the cross,
what have I done?

01:33:03.225 --> 01:33:06.588
I've ruined us!
I've ruined us!

01:33:07.345 --> 01:33:09.544
I'm sorry, Rosa.

01:33:09.545 --> 01:33:11.634
I'm sorry.

01:33:17.545 --> 01:33:19.509
I don't understand.

01:33:22.425 --> 01:33:24.866
What did he do so wrong?

01:33:26.745 --> 01:33:29.789
He reminded people
of their humanity.

01:33:31.905 --> 01:33:33.869
Can't he apologize?

01:33:34.945 --> 01:33:36.590
To who?

01:33:37.385 --> 01:33:38.586
Hitler?

01:33:41.785 --> 01:33:43.944
Will they take him away?

01:33:43.945 --> 01:33:45.192
I don't know.

01:33:45.945 --> 01:33:47.431
But...

01:33:48.505 --> 01:33:51.106
if they come and find me here...

01:33:52.105 --> 01:33:53.989
they'll take all of you away.

01:33:58.585 --> 01:34:00.549
No, Max.

01:34:02.185 --> 01:34:03.989
I have to, Liesel.

01:34:06.025 --> 01:34:07.431
I'm sorry.

01:34:08.345 --> 01:34:10.035
But you promised.

01:34:11.225 --> 01:34:13.189
It's for your own good.

01:34:15.025 --> 01:34:16.556
For your family.

01:34:17.626 --> 01:34:19.874
But you're my family.

01:34:34.506 --> 01:34:36.913
You've kept me alive, Liesel.

01:34:38.146 --> 01:34:39.665
Don't ever forget that.

01:34:39.666 --> 01:34:41.025
I can't lose someone else.

01:34:41.026 --> 01:34:43.433
I'm not lost to you, Liesel.

01:34:43.506 --> 01:34:46.869
You'll always be able
to find me in your words.

01:34:47.346 --> 01:34:49.594
That's where I'll live on.

01:34:55.306 --> 01:34:56.632
Max...

01:34:57.746 --> 01:34:59.436
please.

01:35:01.266 --> 01:35:02.956
Thank you.

01:35:10.306 --> 01:35:11.746
Here.

01:35:12.226 --> 01:35:15.635
It's two blankets
and a pair of socks.

01:35:15.746 --> 01:35:17.945
And a nice piece of cheese
that I've been saving.

01:35:17.946 --> 01:35:19.432
Rosa...

01:35:19.586 --> 01:35:20.867
It's yours.

01:36:17.706 --> 01:36:19.545
Come. Liesel.

01:36:19.546 --> 01:36:21.317
Leave her.

01:36:42.667 --> 01:36:43.868
Hans?

01:36:45.907 --> 01:36:47.791
I'll get my coat.

01:36:56.267 --> 01:36:58.390
You are <i>Herr Steiner?</i>

01:37:02.427 --> 01:37:03.833
What?

01:37:04.827 --> 01:37:07.394
I'm here to talk
about your son, Rudy.

01:37:07.867 --> 01:37:09.307
Rudy Steiner.

01:37:10.347 --> 01:37:12.675
He lives next door.

01:37:13.227 --> 01:37:15.156
What do you want with him?

01:37:32.267 --> 01:37:34.868
He's been selected
for elite training.

01:37:35.547 --> 01:37:37.431
He starts in the summer.

01:37:39.587 --> 01:37:42.358
I'm sorry, Barbra.

01:37:53.307 --> 01:37:55.157
Hans Hubermann?

01:38:30.148 --> 01:38:32.999
What's "conscripted"?

01:39:13.748 --> 01:39:16.307
Look how you've grown.

01:39:16.308 --> 01:39:18.351
I had not noticed.

01:39:19.668 --> 01:39:21.147
I will miss you.

01:39:21.148 --> 01:39:23.307
Everyone's leaving.

01:39:23.308 --> 01:39:24.627
Even Rudy.

01:39:24.628 --> 01:39:27.147
Rudy is going to be fine.

01:39:27.148 --> 01:39:30.787
Look after your Mama, ja? She's not
as strong as she makes out.

01:39:30.788 --> 01:39:32.147
I know.

01:39:32.148 --> 01:39:33.679
Good girl.

01:39:44.348 --> 01:39:46.038
Papa?

01:39:48.668 --> 01:39:50.313
Come home.

01:40:55.789 --> 01:40:57.070
What do you think?

01:41:00.229 --> 01:41:02.033
The shoes let you down.

01:41:03.909 --> 01:41:05.474
And the face.

01:41:06.029 --> 01:41:07.310
Coming?

01:41:07.749 --> 01:41:09.474
Where are you going?

01:41:10.229 --> 01:41:12.955
Isn't it obvious?
I'm running away.

01:41:18.389 --> 01:41:20.508
Have you thought this through?

01:41:20.509 --> 01:41:22.074
<i>Ja.</i>

01:41:22.389 --> 01:41:24.468
I don't want to die.

01:41:24.469 --> 01:41:27.559
There.
All thought through.

01:41:29.069 --> 01:41:31.908
Rudy, where are you going to stay?

01:41:31.909 --> 01:41:34.874
"You"? What about "we"?

01:41:35.429 --> 01:41:37.828
I didn't think
you were this serious.

01:41:37.829 --> 01:41:39.155
What do you call this?

01:41:40.749 --> 01:41:42.439
Packed lunch?

01:41:42.989 --> 01:41:46.398
Is there anything in there
besides your soccer ball?

01:41:53.389 --> 01:41:55.591
I miss my dad.

01:42:00.349 --> 01:42:03.120
I don't even know
if he's alive.

01:42:08.349 --> 01:42:10.472
I'm not ready.

01:42:11.389 --> 01:42:14.593
I want to grow up before I die.

01:42:16.709 --> 01:42:18.195
So did my brother.

01:42:21.469 --> 01:42:22.875
I'm sorry.

01:42:25.869 --> 01:42:27.788
I didn't ask for this.

01:42:27.789 --> 01:42:29.559
Who would?

01:42:32.029 --> 01:42:34.392
I hate Hitler.

01:42:34.550 --> 01:42:35.956
Me, too.

01:42:39.110 --> 01:42:41.312
I hate Hitler!

01:42:42.950 --> 01:42:46.438
I hate Hitler!

01:42:46.470 --> 01:42:49.229
I hate Hitler!
Hitler is a monkey's ass!

01:42:49.230 --> 01:42:50.920
Stick you, Hitler!

01:43:02.550 --> 01:43:04.593
You're all I've got, Rudy.

01:43:09.310 --> 01:43:10.716
Let's go home.

01:43:56.190 --> 01:43:58.389
<i>The bombs were coming thicker now.</i>

01:43:59.790 --> 01:44:01.269
<i>It's probably fair to say...</i>

01:44:01.270 --> 01:44:05.839
<i>that no one was able to serve
the fuhrer as loyally as me.</i>

01:44:47.151 --> 01:44:50.833
There once was
a ghost of a boy...

01:44:51.671 --> 01:44:54.556
who liked to live
in the shadows of things...

01:44:55.431 --> 01:44:57.550
so he wouldn't frighten people.

01:44:57.551 --> 01:44:59.674
What was that?
Who's speaking?

01:45:01.191 --> 01:45:03.110
What are you doing?

01:45:03.111 --> 01:45:05.030
Telling a story.

01:45:05.031 --> 01:45:06.310
Why?

01:45:06.311 --> 01:45:07.558
Whose boy?

01:45:08.471 --> 01:45:09.670
She's telling a story.

01:45:09.671 --> 01:45:10.872
Speak up.

01:45:12.351 --> 01:45:13.598
Start again.

01:45:16.311 --> 01:45:19.150
There once was a ghost of a boy...

01:45:19.151 --> 01:45:21.510
who liked to live in the shadows,

01:45:21.511 --> 01:45:23.918
so he wouldn't frighten people.

01:45:25.431 --> 01:45:30.353
His job was to wait for his
sister, who was still alive.

01:45:32.031 --> 01:45:34.470
She wasn't afraid of the dark...

01:45:34.471 --> 01:45:38.392
because she knew
that's where her brother was.

01:45:40.311 --> 01:45:41.956
Go on.

01:45:42.711 --> 01:45:47.041
At night, when darkness
came to her room...

01:45:47.911 --> 01:45:50.510
she would tell her brother
about the day.

01:45:50.511 --> 01:45:55.190
She would remind him how the
sun felt on his skin...

01:45:55.191 --> 01:45:57.710
and what the air
felt like to breathe...

01:46:01.271 --> 01:46:05.715
Or how snow felt on his tongue.
And that reminded her...

01:46:05.911 --> 01:46:08.432
that she was still alive.

01:46:23.351 --> 01:46:24.791
Gentlemen...

01:46:25.471 --> 01:46:27.116
how is everybody?

01:46:27.351 --> 01:46:30.510
Look at this one. They are starting
to conscript grandfathers.

01:46:31.671 --> 01:46:36.195
Hey, old man. Old man,
are they your own teeth?

01:47:02.552 --> 01:47:06.111
Together, they sat in the forest...

01:47:06.112 --> 01:47:09.431
and watched the sun rise.

01:47:09.432 --> 01:47:12.831
And as he disappeared
back into the shadows...

01:47:12.832 --> 01:47:16.514
she waved goodbye
for the last time.

01:47:18.792 --> 01:47:20.676
Oh, Liesel.

01:48:04.552 --> 01:48:05.913
Max?

01:48:06.992 --> 01:48:08.193
Max?

01:48:08.672 --> 01:48:10.158
Max!

01:48:15.192 --> 01:48:16.439
Max!

01:48:17.272 --> 01:48:18.871
<i>Saumensch!</i>

01:48:18.872 --> 01:48:20.791
What are you up to?

01:48:20.792 --> 01:48:22.039
Max?

01:48:22.992 --> 01:48:24.921
Liesel!
Max?

01:48:25.792 --> 01:48:27.596
Do you know Max?
Liesel!

01:48:27.992 --> 01:48:29.273
Do you know Max?

01:48:31.752 --> 01:48:33.363
Max?

01:48:36.352 --> 01:48:38.042
Do you know Max?

01:48:45.312 --> 01:48:47.436
Get out of here, you stupid girl!

01:48:49.553 --> 01:48:50.800
Liesel!

01:48:51.313 --> 01:48:53.754
I won't forget you.
I won't forget you.

01:48:53.833 --> 01:48:55.512
I won't forget you.

01:48:55.513 --> 01:48:57.602
I won't forget you, Max.

01:48:58.273 --> 01:48:59.520
Liesel!

01:49:05.553 --> 01:49:06.800
Go out!

01:49:07.393 --> 01:49:08.594
Liesel!

01:49:20.913 --> 01:49:23.684
You're too much like your
father, you know that?

01:49:25.553 --> 01:49:27.994
What's wrong with that?

01:49:31.193 --> 01:49:32.918
Nothing.

01:49:39.993 --> 01:49:42.392
Hey, Saumensch, want to play?

01:49:42.393 --> 01:49:44.721
<i>Nein,</i> not today.

01:49:44.993 --> 01:49:47.592
Then let's steal something.

01:49:47.593 --> 01:49:50.194
I don't steal. I borrow.

01:49:50.633 --> 01:49:55.680
Then let's go borrow Franz Deutscher's
bike und get out of here.

01:49:56.633 --> 01:49:57.914
Can't you see I'm reading?

01:49:59.113 --> 01:50:00.644
Are you still angry with me?

01:50:02.273 --> 01:50:03.713
For what?

01:50:05.553 --> 01:50:07.357
Saving you.

01:50:07.793 --> 01:50:09.483
<i>Nein,</i> Rudy.

01:50:09.513 --> 01:50:10.953
You're very brave.

01:50:26.873 --> 01:50:28.484
Papa!

01:50:30.513 --> 01:50:32.044
You're home!

01:50:39.353 --> 01:50:41.317
What is it, my girl?

01:50:46.913 --> 01:50:48.558
My girl.

01:50:49.233 --> 01:50:50.798
My girl.

01:51:14.954 --> 01:51:17.521
It's nice to hear you play.

01:51:17.594 --> 01:51:19.603
I can't hear properly.

01:51:21.474 --> 01:51:23.278
I'm going to bed.

01:51:24.114 --> 01:51:26.601
Don't stay up too late, you two.

01:51:39.114 --> 01:51:41.715
Your mama told me what you did.

01:51:45.114 --> 01:51:46.964
I shouldn't have.

01:51:47.114 --> 01:51:49.157
Maybe you had to.

01:51:52.394 --> 01:51:54.995
I keep thinking about Max.

01:51:55.714 --> 01:51:57.154
Wondering where he is.

01:51:58.394 --> 01:52:00.164
Me, too.

01:52:01.834 --> 01:52:04.162
I'm not sure what it all meant.

01:52:05.394 --> 01:52:07.756
Everything he went through.

01:52:08.274 --> 01:52:10.442
Everything we did.

01:52:13.274 --> 01:52:15.920
We were just being people.

01:52:16.954 --> 01:52:18.485
That's what people do.

01:52:21.234 --> 01:52:22.720
Liesel...

01:52:23.634 --> 01:52:25.802
you are all grown up.

01:52:31.034 --> 01:52:35.793
<i>All I have learned is that
life makes no promises.</i>

01:52:35.794 --> 01:52:37.962
<i>So I had better get started.</i>

01:52:38.354 --> 01:52:41.160
<i>I have always
tried to ignore it...</i>

01:52:41.274 --> 01:52:44.683
<i>but I know this all
started with a train...</i>

01:52:46.274 --> 01:52:48.203
<i>and some snow...</i>

01:52:49.114 --> 01:52:50.839
<i>and my brother.</i>

01:52:53.834 --> 01:52:57.756
<i>Outside the car, the world was
thrown inside a snow-shaker.</i>

01:52:57.835 --> 01:53:00.074
<i>Und on a place
called Heaven Street...</i>

01:53:00.075 --> 01:53:03.994
<i>a man with an accordion heart und
a woman cloaked in thunder...</i>

01:53:03.995 --> 01:53:05.799
<i>waited for their new daughter.</i>

01:53:13.195 --> 01:53:17.354
<i>He lived under our stairs like
a quiet owl with no wings...</i>

01:53:17.355 --> 01:53:20.559
<i>until the sun forgot
what his face was.</i>

01:53:26.995 --> 01:53:29.234
<i>The book floated
down the river...</i>

01:53:29.235 --> 01:53:33.201
<i>like a red fish being chased
by a yellow-haired boy.</i>

01:53:43.275 --> 01:53:46.206
<i>For Max, who gave me eyes.</i>

01:54:12.635 --> 01:54:15.042
Good night, Your Majesty.

01:54:26.115 --> 01:54:30.434
<i>I've always quite liked the
image of me with a sickle and cape.</i>

01:54:30.435 --> 01:54:33.154
<i>Dark and formidable.</i>

01:54:33.155 --> 01:54:37.599
<i>Unfortunately, I'm far more
ordinary and commonplace.</i>

01:54:39.355 --> 01:54:43.480
<i>No one intended to destroy
a street named after Heaven.</i>

01:54:44.035 --> 01:54:46.714
<i>It was a misread on a map.</i>

01:54:46.715 --> 01:54:49.236
<i>No sirens that evening.</i>

01:54:50.395 --> 01:54:52.962
<i>First were Rudy's brothers.</i>

01:54:56.555 --> 01:54:59.326
<i>I read their simple dreams.</i>

01:55:03.316 --> 01:55:06.042
<i>Then, I kissed his mother.</i>

01:55:08.436 --> 01:55:12.561
<i>And stole the meanness
from Franz Deutscher's heart.</i>

01:55:17.476 --> 01:55:20.441
<i>Rosa, I caught mid-snore.</i>

01:55:21.036 --> 01:55:24.675
<i>I could swear I heard
her call me a Saukerl.</i>

01:55:24.676 --> 01:55:30.565
<i>Then I felt her regrets for not
sharing more of her very big heart.</i>

01:55:31.196 --> 01:55:36.402
<i>As for Hans, his soul was
lighter than a child's.</i>

01:55:36.516 --> 01:55:40.641
<i>I felt his itch for one last
tune on his accordion...</i>

01:55:40.996 --> 01:55:43.676
<i>and heard his final thought...</i>

01:55:45.396 --> 01:55:47.280
<i>"Liesel."</i>

01:56:40.196 --> 01:56:41.682
Over here!

01:56:47.476 --> 01:56:49.201
Just over.

01:56:57.076 --> 01:56:58.323
Your hand.

01:57:11.037 --> 01:57:13.478
Mama? Papa?

01:57:51.237 --> 01:57:52.768
Papa?

01:57:58.357 --> 01:57:59.922
Papa.

01:58:25.997 --> 01:58:27.483
Rudy?

01:58:42.717 --> 01:58:44.885
<i>Saumensch.</i>

01:58:45.997 --> 01:58:47.358
Liesel.

01:58:51.757 --> 01:58:53.116
I need to tell you...

01:58:53.117 --> 01:58:54.807
Don't speak.

01:58:55.477 --> 01:58:57.566
I need to say it.

01:59:01.837 --> 01:59:03.198
I...

01:59:07.237 --> 01:59:08.599
Rudy?

01:59:10.038 --> 01:59:11.399
Rudy, nein.

01:59:12.238 --> 01:59:13.883
Rudy, wake up.

01:59:14.518 --> 01:59:16.077
Rudy, <i>nein!</i>

01:59:16.078 --> 01:59:18.929
Wake up, Rudy!
Rudy, wake up!

01:59:19.518 --> 01:59:21.288
Rudy, kiss me.

01:59:26.718 --> 01:59:31.446
<i>Rudy, his soul just
rolled into my arms.</i>

02:00:49.038 --> 02:00:53.687
<i>In my job, I am always finding
humans at their best...</i>

02:00:53.958 --> 02:00:56.037
<i>and their worst.</i>

02:00:56.038 --> 02:00:59.526
<i>I see their ugliness,
and their beauty...</i>

02:00:59.878 --> 02:01:04.083
<i>and I wonder how the
same thing can be both.</i>

02:01:56.639 --> 02:01:57.886
Liesel!

02:03:00.639 --> 02:03:02.079
Max!

02:03:14.599 --> 02:03:17.799
<i>I have seen a great many things.</i>

02:03:17.800 --> 02:03:21.319
<i>I've attended all the
world's worst disasters...</i>

02:03:21.320 --> 02:03:24.490
<i>and worked for the greatest of villains.</i>

02:03:24.840 --> 02:03:28.089
<i>And I've seen the greatest wonders.</i>

02:03:28.200 --> 02:03:31.199
<i>But it's still like I said it was.</i>

02:03:31.200 --> 02:03:34.131
<i>No one lives forever.</i>

02:03:42.080 --> 02:03:45.239
<i>When I finally came for Liesel...</i>

02:03:45.240 --> 02:03:47.839
<i>I took selfish pleasure
in the knowledge</i>

02:03:47.840 --> 02:03:51.567
<i>that she had lived
her 90 years so wisely.</i>

02:03:58.240 --> 02:04:02.519
<i>By then, her stories
had touched many souls.</i>

02:04:02.520 --> 02:04:05.849
<i>Some of whom I came
to know in passing.</i>

02:04:11.320 --> 02:04:16.686
<i>Max, whose friendship lasted
almost as long as Liesel.</i>

02:04:17.360 --> 02:04:19.210
<i>Almost.</i>

02:04:21.920 --> 02:04:24.119
<i>In her final thoughts...</i>

02:04:24.120 --> 02:04:28.723
<i>she saw the long list of lives
that merged with hers.</i>

02:04:29.240 --> 02:04:30.919
<i>Her three children.</i>

02:04:30.920 --> 02:04:32.999
<i>Her grandchildren.</i>

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.248
<i>Her husband.</i>

02:04:35.640 --> 02:04:38.439
<i>Among them, lit like lanterns...</i>

02:04:38.440 --> 02:04:40.839
<i>were Hans and Rosa...</i>

02:04:40.840 --> 02:04:42.399
<i>her brother...</i>

02:04:42.400 --> 02:04:47.640
<i>and the boy whose hair remained
the color of lemons forever.</i>

02:04:50.120 --> 02:04:51.959
<i>I wanted to tell the book thief</i>

02:04:51.960 --> 02:04:53.839
<i>she was one of the few souls...</i>

02:04:53.840 --> 02:04:57.840
<i>that made me wonder
what it was to live.</i>

02:04:58.520 --> 02:05:01.999
<i>But in the end,
there were no words.</i>

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:03.964
<i>Only peace.</i>

02:05:04.800 --> 02:05:07.999
<i>The only truth I truly know...</i>

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:12.842
<i>is that I am haunted by humans.</i>
