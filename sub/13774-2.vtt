WEBVTT

00:00.985 --> 00:03.095
Babe, I'm having week one issues.

00:04.625 --> 00:06.630
- Which tie?
- Left.

00:06.911 --> 00:09.742
Ricky Williams or Toby Gerhardt?
I am not sure. What do you think?

00:10.727 --> 00:13.101
I don't know. I am not in the league.
I have no opinion.

00:13.356 --> 00:16.140
Yet you have an opinion about ties and
you're not an Italian tie-maker.

00:16.922 --> 00:17.864
What?

00:18.357 --> 00:20.790
- Are you mad about the whole Vegas thing?
- No.

00:20.910 --> 00:21.915
No, I'm not mad at all.

00:22.035 --> 00:24.069
Well, then, help me out
with this decision, then.

00:24.137 --> 00:25.489
Okay, I'm a little mad.

00:25.609 --> 00:26.372
I knew it.

00:26.439 --> 00:27.406
See?

00:27.474 --> 00:29.408
You're making a big
deal out of this thing.

00:30.443 --> 00:31.076
Whoa, what are you doing?

00:31.144 --> 00:33.012
What does it look like I'm doing?

00:33.079 --> 00:35.948
I-I do not, I don't know what...
This is intimacy, sweetheart.

00:36.016 --> 00:37.383
This is what you signed on for.

00:37.450 --> 00:39.385
This is not intimacy, okay?

00:39.452 --> 00:40.652
Intimacy is spooning.

00:40.720 --> 00:42.921
This is like watching
the Nature Channel.

00:42.989 --> 00:44.656
I thought we were comfortable
with our bodies.

00:44.724 --> 00:47.459
 I am incredibly
uncomfortable right now.

00:47.527 --> 00:50.095
Can you at least toss me the cordless?

00:50.096 --> 00:53.713
<font color="#EC14BD">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#EC14BD">www.addic7ed.com</font>

00:53.833 --> 00:56.201
I don't think what I did was
wrong; I feel like it was fine.

00:56.269 --> 00:57.202
You're a vile animal.

00:57.270 --> 01:00.039
No, look, she's the person I've chosen
to spend the rest of my life with.

01:00.106 --> 01:02.508
I should be allowed to be comfortable
being myself around her.

01:02.575 --> 01:04.410
Isn't there such a
thing as too much sharing?

01:04.477 --> 01:06.111
Yeah, you want to talk
about too much sharing?

01:06.179 --> 01:07.679
She pulled me into the labor room.

01:07.747 --> 01:09.496
So this is payback for the placenta.

01:09.616 --> 01:11.633
- Payback for the placenta, right.
- Placenta is beautiful.

01:11.753 --> 01:14.250
It literally is the circle of life.

01:14.370 --> 01:16.273
It looks like a Hefty bag
that washed up on the shore.

01:16.393 --> 01:19.328
And by the way, after Vegas, you
were already in the doghouse

01:19.396 --> 01:21.931
with Jenny, so you really have
to show some sort of effort.

01:21.999 --> 01:23.800
I don't understand
what "effort" means.

01:23.867 --> 01:25.885
You got to keep it spontaneous,

01:26.005 --> 01:30.295
so that's why every 2.6 months,
I make a grand gesture.

01:30.415 --> 01:32.108
You know, the rest of
the year I coast by.

01:32.176 --> 01:34.844
It's like how studios release
these big blockbuster movies and

01:34.912 --> 01:38.548
then the rest of the year, they just
sort of fart out Katherine Heigl dreck.

01:38.615 --> 01:41.150
Like, I'm gonna take Sofia this
weekend and I'm gonna give her a

01:41.218 --> 01:43.853
Terrific Lady Day...
A Terrific Lady Day?

01:43.921 --> 01:47.590
You do whatever they want and you got
to look interested the whole day.

01:47.658 --> 01:48.591
"What's that?

01:48.659 --> 01:51.394
Heirloom tomatoes are different
from regular tomatoes?

01:51.462 --> 01:52.361
Amazing."

01:52.429 --> 01:54.864
And at the end of that day, we
will adjourn to our bedroom and

01:54.932 --> 01:56.532
we will culminate with
me entering my wife.

01:57.434 --> 01:58.367
Enough.

01:58.435 --> 01:59.202
No, no, no.

01:59.269 --> 02:01.137
We don't want to hear about it.

02:01.205 --> 02:01.971
Are you kidding me?

02:02.039 --> 02:05.241
When we were dating, all you wanted
to hear was sex details about Sofia.

02:05.309 --> 02:08.578
Yeah, but you're married now and we're
literally as bored with it as you are.

02:08.645 --> 02:10.580
It's like second-generation
stale to us.

02:10.646 --> 02:11.481
But he does have a point.

02:11.548 --> 02:14.851
You need to find that little thing that says...
I got to put in some effort.

02:14.918 --> 02:16.853
Oh, Raffi's coming by for a drink.

02:16.920 --> 02:17.553
You invited him here?

02:17.621 --> 02:18.554
Why?

02:18.622 --> 02:19.589
'Cause he's in the league.

02:19.656 --> 02:20.423
He's our friend.

02:20.491 --> 02:21.390
You know we hate him, right?

02:21.458 --> 02:22.225
You realize that?

02:22.292 --> 02:23.059
We call him El Cunado.

02:23.126 --> 02:23.893
He's vile.

02:23.961 --> 02:26.863
By the way, "El Cunado" just
means "brother-in-law" in Spanish.

02:26.930 --> 02:27.864
I know what you're trying to do.

02:27.931 --> 02:29.866
You're trying to make it sound dirty.

02:29.933 --> 02:31.400
No, it does sound dirty.

02:31.468 --> 02:33.236
El Cunado.

02:33.303 --> 02:34.403
Cunado.

02:34.471 --> 02:37.006
When did you become such
a fan of El Cunado?

02:37.074 --> 02:39.575
You used to rip on him
constantly, and then all of a

02:39.643 --> 02:41.410
sudden you marry his sister and
he's your best friend now?

02:41.478 --> 02:44.080
You used to call him, like, a
homeless, ethnic Santa Claus.

02:44.147 --> 02:47.917
It happened to be around
Christmastime, and he was

02:47.985 --> 02:50.186
carrying a big bag of things.

02:50.254 --> 02:54.790
Guys, uh, over here at 2:00,
there's this chick I work with.

02:56.026 --> 02:59.195
We're up for the same case, it's
a big thing, and, uh, she's

02:59.263 --> 03:00.696
one of those Goody Two-Shoes.

03:00.764 --> 03:04.300
She's a team player, she
uses words like "synergy."

03:04.368 --> 03:06.335
She's, she's kissing Taco.

03:06.403 --> 03:08.905
What the (bleep) is going on?

03:08.972 --> 03:11.474
Oh, my God, this is perfect.

03:11.542 --> 03:12.475
How's it going?

03:12.543 --> 03:13.309
Hey, guys.

03:13.377 --> 03:14.310
Hey.

03:14.378 --> 03:15.311
Hi.

03:15.379 --> 03:16.312
Hi.

03:16.380 --> 03:18.381
Um, just so you know, in your
inbox, there is a corrected

03:18.448 --> 03:21.050
version of your motion for The State v.
Kinley.

03:21.118 --> 03:22.184
Also, check your inbox.

03:22.252 --> 03:23.219
I sent you a message.

03:23.287 --> 03:25.117
My neighbor's cat's still
making that noise.

03:25.237 --> 03:27.832
Oh, these are some of Kevin's friends.

03:27.952 --> 03:29.926
They're in a fantasy football
league together.

03:30.046 --> 03:32.514
It's a tad childish, but
hey, they enjoy it.

03:32.582 --> 03:33.448
I won it.

03:33.516 --> 03:34.349
Oh, good for you.

03:34.417 --> 03:36.652
Yeah, you know you're in
it, too, Taco, right?

03:36.719 --> 03:38.120
Yeah, just to humor them.

03:38.187 --> 03:39.154
That's so thoughtful of you.

03:40.056 --> 03:40.889
Oh, you know what?

03:40.957 --> 03:42.024
I'm gonna have to take this.

03:42.091 --> 03:43.492
Yeah.

03:43.560 --> 03:44.526
I may be right back.

03:47.063 --> 03:48.897
Probably O'Connor... he's
a ballbuster, that guy.

03:48.965 --> 03:50.632
Yeah, O'Connor is my
boss, too, Taco.

03:50.700 --> 03:52.634
What the hell's he
doing calling her?

03:52.702 --> 03:53.468
I don't know, man.

03:53.536 --> 03:54.903
I'm off the clock.

03:54.971 --> 03:56.905
You don't have a clock, Taco.

03:56.973 --> 03:58.106
Yeah, I do, in my kitchen.

03:58.174 --> 03:58.941
It makes animal noises.

03:59.008 --> 03:59.942
Oh.

04:00.009 --> 04:01.910
Okay, I am turning this off.

04:01.978 --> 04:02.878
All right.

04:02.946 --> 04:04.980
And I am officially yours.

04:05.048 --> 04:05.981
Okay.

04:07.250 --> 04:09.212
God, you smell good.

04:10.005 --> 04:10.886
Babe.

04:10.954 --> 04:11.887
Hey.

04:11.955 --> 04:14.122
How much do you love
this guy, huh?

04:14.190 --> 04:15.123
What did you do?

04:15.191 --> 04:16.091
I made a plan.

04:16.159 --> 04:18.927
You know that O'Connor fund- raiser
I have downtown this weekend?

04:18.995 --> 04:19.928
Yeah.

04:19.995 --> 04:22.864
I'm gonna make a whole adult
weekend out of the thing.

04:22.932 --> 04:24.967
We're gonna get a hotel, we're
gonna go out to dinner.

04:25.034 --> 04:26.301
It's gonna be awesome.

04:26.369 --> 04:27.302
A real grown-up date?

04:27.370 --> 04:29.605
Yes, we are going to get dressed
up, we're going to drink

04:29.672 --> 04:31.273
urbane $17 martinis.

04:31.341 --> 04:32.307
I might even talk politics.

04:32.375 --> 04:34.242
Ooh, I love when you
talk politics.

04:34.310 --> 04:36.144
Yeah, a little urban
housing development.

04:36.212 --> 04:37.145
Oh.

04:37.213 --> 04:38.246
Little financial crisis.

04:38.314 --> 04:39.247
Oh, come on.

04:39.315 --> 04:40.082
Little Ben Bernanke.

04:40.149 --> 04:40.916
Ben Bernanke.

04:40.984 --> 04:41.883
Yeah, how's that sound?

04:41.951 --> 04:42.651
Say it again.

04:42.719 --> 04:43.485
So you in?

04:43.553 --> 04:44.319
So in.

04:44.387 --> 04:45.320
Good.

04:45.388 --> 04:46.488
Yeah.

04:50.005 --> 04:50.938
You guys ready for week one?

04:51.006 --> 04:51.939
Yeah.

04:52.007 --> 04:52.774
Week one.

04:52.841 --> 04:53.775
I'm very excited.

04:53.842 --> 04:57.111
And I really see some good
matchups this weekend, huh?

04:57.179 --> 05:01.316
The unblinking eye of Sauron has
Grima Wormtongue in his sights.

05:01.383 --> 05:03.685
It's amazing how pointless and
terrible your analogies are.

05:03.752 --> 05:06.487
I can't believe I'm actually rooting
for Ruxin to win here, but I really...

05:06.555 --> 05:08.156
Raffi in the house!

05:08.223 --> 05:10.792
What's up, my boys?

05:10.859 --> 05:12.694
Hey, it's Raffi.

05:12.761 --> 05:13.695
How's it going, bros?

05:13.762 --> 05:15.496
Raffi bringing the heat right away.

05:15.564 --> 05:16.698
Oh, man.

05:16.765 --> 05:17.699
Funny.

05:17.766 --> 05:19.133
What are we talking about?

05:19.201 --> 05:21.703
Talking about, uh,
football... week one.

05:21.770 --> 05:24.238
Oh, man, I am killing it in
my fantasy football league.

05:24.306 --> 05:27.175
We didn't even st... this is week one
of the fantasy football league.

05:27.242 --> 05:29.077
No, no, no, real football,
like in England.

05:29.144 --> 05:30.311
You mean fútbol?

05:30.379 --> 05:31.312
Yeah.

05:31.380 --> 05:32.313
Soccer?

05:32.381 --> 05:36.117
No, sorry, that's, that's what,
that's what assholes call it.

05:36.185 --> 05:37.118
Sorry.

05:37.186 --> 05:40.488
Ah, the shit-talking has already
started between week one

05:40.556 --> 05:44.144
adversaries Raffi and Kevin..

05:44.264 --> 05:47.194
Raffi, what are you... Oh, my God.
That's yours now.

05:47.314 --> 05:48.582
I'm in your head, bro.

05:48.702 --> 05:50.939
Get ready, 'cause I
am coming for you.

05:51.059 --> 05:54.624
Prepare yourself, because I am
literally going to sodomize you

05:54.744 --> 05:55.507
on the battlefield.

05:55.491 --> 05:58.060
I'm going to have nonconsensual
sex with your face and butt.

05:58.127 --> 05:58.860
All right.

05:58.928 --> 06:00.696
And then I'm coming for
your wife and your kids.

06:00.763 --> 06:02.064
Hey, Raffi.

06:02.131 --> 06:04.633
I'm just kidding, man,
just busting balls.

06:04.701 --> 06:05.634
Jukebox.

06:05.702 --> 06:06.635
I'm gonna put seven dollars'

06:06.703 --> 06:10.439
worth of Hoobastank in it, and I'm
coming back to hang with you bros.

06:10.506 --> 06:11.640
He's so funny, man.

06:11.952 --> 06:15.877
You know, within 48 seconds, he
sucked all the fun out of the room.

06:15.997 --> 06:16.904
He's a fun vacuum.

06:16.882 --> 06:18.015
You guys, he's the new guy.

06:18.083 --> 06:19.817
You just... you razz him a
little, but you take advantage

06:19.885 --> 06:20.651
of him in trades.

06:20.719 --> 06:22.486
He's more worthless than
the black Thompson Twin.

06:22.554 --> 06:24.422
You know, I can't tell if
that's more dated or more

06:24.489 --> 06:25.523
racist. Any thoughts?

06:25.590 --> 06:26.991
That might be racist.

06:27.059 --> 06:28.426
I think it's more dated.

06:28.493 --> 06:30.027
Either way, you're
right, though.

06:30.095 --> 06:31.529
Oh... we're out of beer, bro.

06:31.596 --> 06:32.463
You should get us another round.

06:32.531 --> 06:33.431
Oh, God, I'm out of here.

06:33.498 --> 06:36.033
What are we doing this weekend?
Wait a minute.

06:36.101 --> 06:36.867
I got plans, man, sorry.

06:36.935 --> 06:37.701
Come on.

06:37.769 --> 06:41.672
I got plans, too, but these two
single gentlemen are going

06:41.740 --> 06:44.041
to a party and they are trying
to put together a posse.

06:44.109 --> 06:45.042
Yeah.

06:45.110 --> 06:46.043
What?

06:46.111 --> 06:48.446
Later, guys.

06:48.513 --> 06:50.214
Oh, shit, you guys
are crewing up?

06:50.282 --> 06:51.248
Let's do this.

06:51.316 --> 06:53.451
I don't even know if this
party is happening.

06:53.518 --> 06:55.019
I think the party is
happening tomorrow night.

06:55.087 --> 06:55.853
Sweet, yeah.

06:55.921 --> 06:57.588
You should come with
us, and you know why?

06:57.656 --> 06:59.523
We have a tradition
in the league.

06:59.591 --> 07:01.459
It's a rule that we take turns...

07:01.526 --> 07:02.493
Oh, on the same girl?

07:02.561 --> 07:05.463
Well, no, we take turns as
designated drivers, so since

07:05.530 --> 07:08.065
you're new to the league...
You are going to be the

07:08.133 --> 07:09.033
designated driver.

07:09.101 --> 07:10.034
Awesome.

07:10.102 --> 07:10.935
Pick us up at 8:00.

07:11.002 --> 07:11.869
Oh, I don't have a car.

07:11.937 --> 07:13.871
That's fine, you can
just use Andre's.

07:13.939 --> 07:16.173
Oh, no, I mean...
Perfect, done.

07:16.241 --> 07:17.174
Thank you.

07:17.242 --> 07:19.543
Cheers.

07:26.094 --> 07:28.463
Thank you for my
grown-up weekend.

07:28.530 --> 07:29.197
You look beautiful.

07:29.264 --> 07:29.864
Thank you.

07:29.932 --> 07:30.832
Do you like my earrings?

07:30.899 --> 07:31.466
I do.

07:31.533 --> 07:34.101
When I dropped off Ellie, my mom
just handed them over to me.

07:34.169 --> 07:34.936
They were Grandma's.

07:35.003 --> 07:36.838
That's an unbelievable
trade-off.

07:36.905 --> 07:37.839
I know.

07:37.906 --> 07:40.608
Let's go overpay
for some drinks.

07:40.676 --> 07:42.243
Ah, good evening, gentlemen.

07:42.311 --> 07:43.311
Hi.

07:43.378 --> 07:44.278
Hello, Taco.

07:44.346 --> 07:45.313
Taco, look at you.

07:45.380 --> 07:46.848
Yeah, in Uncle Frank's suit.

07:46.915 --> 07:49.050
Yeah. Gave me the suits when
he became handicapped.

07:49.117 --> 07:49.917
Did he? Hey.

07:49.985 --> 07:50.618
There you are.

07:50.686 --> 07:52.253
I was wondering where
you were hiding.

07:52.321 --> 07:52.920
Hi, sweetheart.

07:52.988 --> 07:53.654
Hi, Lily.

07:53.722 --> 07:54.422
Hi.

07:54.490 --> 07:55.323
This is my wife, Jenny.

07:55.390 --> 07:57.107
Hi. And you are dating Taco?

07:57.227 --> 07:57.881
Yes.

07:58.001 --> 07:59.647
He's my hot date for tonight.

07:58.927 --> 07:59.861
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

07:59.928 --> 08:02.109
- Oh, that's great.
- Yeah, good for you, guys.

08:05.781 --> 08:07.593
We're not gonna let this ruin
our grown-up weekend, babe...

08:07.713 --> 08:09.474
No. Not.

08:09.594 --> 08:10.932
We should go upstairs
to our hotel room.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.534
What are you gonna
go upstairs for?

08:12.602 --> 08:15.837
I mean, let's go upstairs
to our hotel room.

08:15.905 --> 08:17.939
I can't... I have
O'Connor's speech.

08:18.007 --> 08:20.409
I think you're just gonna
have to be quick.

08:20.476 --> 08:21.143
I can do that.

08:21.210 --> 08:22.173
- I know.
- All right, let's go.

08:24.113 --> 08:26.148
That car drives like
garbage, am I right?

08:26.215 --> 08:28.016
No, it doesn't drive
like garbage.

08:28.084 --> 08:29.484
It's a brand-new Porsche
Cayenne, okay?

08:29.552 --> 08:30.619
You don't know how to drive it.

08:30.686 --> 08:31.653
You're pressing all the buttons.

08:31.721 --> 08:32.486
It's not a video game.

08:32.554 --> 08:33.554
I thought he did a fine job.

08:33.623 --> 08:34.155
Thank you.

08:34.222 --> 08:35.857
In fact, you should do
this all the time for us.

08:35.924 --> 08:37.426
He's not doing it all
the time, all right?

08:37.493 --> 08:39.461
I just want to go find this
girl, just... I'll be back.

08:39.529 --> 08:40.429
Wait, wait, wait, hang on.

08:40.496 --> 08:41.797
If we get separated,
I need to call you.

08:41.864 --> 08:42.631
It's a house party.

08:42.698 --> 08:44.032
We're not going to
get separated.

08:44.100 --> 08:44.868
I don't know where
you're going to go.

08:44.904 --> 08:46.568
Maybe you're off, like,
finger blasting somebody.

08:46.688 --> 08:48.074
Andre...
Finger blaster.

08:48.194 --> 08:49.438
I'll put it in myself.

08:49.505 --> 08:50.172
Dude, give me your e-mail.

08:50.239 --> 08:51.073
Do you like funny videos?

08:51.140 --> 08:51.873
No.

08:51.941 --> 08:53.475
He loves funny videos.

08:53.543 --> 08:56.078
Dude, seriously, I have such
funny videos to send you.

08:56.145 --> 08:56.912
Holy shit.

08:56.979 --> 08:57.479
Great.

08:57.547 --> 08:59.481
One of them's a pig having
sex with a monkey.

08:59.549 --> 09:00.248
The monkey freaks out.

09:00.316 --> 09:01.450
Excuse me, where you going?

09:01.517 --> 09:03.485
I'm going to find
my friend... Molly.

09:03.553 --> 09:04.586
So, enjoy yourselves.

09:04.654 --> 09:07.556
Um, well, nice to
see you again.

09:07.623 --> 09:08.757
Uh, what you got here?

09:08.825 --> 09:09.591
Hmm?

09:10.797 --> 09:11.933
Whoa, that's really strong.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.935
Super strong, so I only
have to drink a little.

09:14.002 --> 09:15.002
'Cause, you know, I'm driving.

09:15.070 --> 09:17.238
I think you're not supposed to
be drinking anything, 'cause

09:17.306 --> 09:18.205
you're driving, right?

09:18.273 --> 09:19.373
I'm the designated driver.

09:19.441 --> 09:21.676
When you need somebody
to drive, I do it.

09:21.743 --> 09:23.911
But there's an implied value
that you might be sober.

09:23.979 --> 09:26.380
Well, I will be... like 30
minutes before we're going to

09:26.448 --> 09:29.350
leave, you give me the heads up,
I'll go to the bathroom, I'll

09:29.418 --> 09:33.287
crap the booze out, have
a mint, good to go.

09:33.355 --> 09:34.188
Crap and a mint?

09:34.256 --> 09:35.222
Crap the booze out.

09:35.290 --> 09:36.123
It works?

09:36.191 --> 09:39.393
Sort of, yeah.

09:39.461 --> 09:40.628
Voila.

09:40.696 --> 09:42.163
Oh, my God.

09:42.230 --> 09:44.298
I love Terrific Lady Day.

09:44.366 --> 09:46.467
Yeah, you should, but you know
what you're going to love

09:46.535 --> 09:47.068
even more?

09:47.135 --> 09:47.969
Terrific Lady Night.

09:48.036 --> 09:48.936
Ooh.

09:49.004 --> 09:50.037
You were really good today.

09:50.105 --> 09:52.373
You didn't complain once at the
farmer's market, and you held my

09:52.441 --> 09:53.007
hand.

09:53.075 --> 09:55.076
Mm-hmm. Who else is going to
hold your hand when you're

09:55.143 --> 09:56.978
looking at organic
squash for 20 minutes?

09:57.045 --> 09:58.679
And the best part is...
Mm-hmm?

09:58.747 --> 10:00.514
...you didn't mention
football once.

10:00.582 --> 10:03.417
Well, there are no games on
Saturday in the NFL, that are

10:03.485 --> 10:05.219
more important than you.

10:05.287 --> 10:07.655
And I also want to
say, thank you.

10:07.723 --> 10:08.522
For what?

10:08.590 --> 10:10.224
For taking my brother
into the league.

10:10.292 --> 10:11.726
We love him.

10:11.793 --> 10:12.393
I loathe him.

10:12.461 --> 10:13.961
I loathe the El Cunado.

10:14.029 --> 10:15.162
He's awful.

10:15.230 --> 10:17.430
Like, it's almost like a joke.

10:17.810 --> 10:18.977
- It is a joke.
- I know what you mean.

10:19.990 --> 10:23.492
This party is awesome.
What is this?

10:23.612 --> 10:24.885
That's my drink.

10:25.005 --> 10:27.937
Mm, El Cunado like.

10:28.057 --> 10:29.443
All right, I'll check you guys later.

10:29.511 --> 10:30.077
Dick punch!

10:30.145 --> 10:30.611
Oh.

10:30.679 --> 10:32.446
Let's all get the same
girl pregnant tonight.

10:32.514 --> 10:33.347
Did you see that?

10:33.415 --> 10:35.016
He embraces the El
Cunado nickname.

10:35.083 --> 10:37.451
It's like we're throwing
feces at him and he's just

10:37.519 --> 10:38.452
playing with it.

10:38.520 --> 10:39.620
It's horrible.

10:39.688 --> 10:41.555
The worst thing that's
ever happened to us.

10:41.623 --> 10:42.790
This is our 9-11.

10:44.161 --> 10:45.226
Oh, my God.

10:45.293 --> 10:46.994
That's the girl.

10:47.062 --> 10:47.995
That's Molly.

10:48.063 --> 10:48.629
It's no big deal.

10:48.697 --> 10:50.431
It's just like a brand-new
Porsche Cayenne.

10:50.499 --> 10:50.998
Porsche?

10:51.066 --> 10:51.532
Yeah.

10:51.600 --> 10:52.600
Oh, my God, what color is it?

10:52.668 --> 10:56.270
Green, like the color of money...
and the color of your eyes.

10:56.338 --> 10:58.773
She seems to have taken a shine
to the gaucho stylings of

10:58.840 --> 10:59.740
El Cunado.

10:59.808 --> 11:02.009
Okay, you know what, this
isn't funny anymore.

11:02.077 --> 11:03.711
Fix this. It's your fault.

11:03.779 --> 11:05.012
Get rid of him. Right now.

11:05.080 --> 11:05.780
I don't care how.

11:05.847 --> 11:06.747
I got it, I got it.

11:06.815 --> 11:08.315
I'm going to do to him
what I do to you.

11:08.383 --> 11:09.016
What's that?

11:09.084 --> 11:10.718
Don't worry about it,
I'll take care of it.

11:10.786 --> 11:12.653
I don't know what your deal is,
but I found these pills in

11:12.721 --> 11:13.454
the medicine cabinet.

11:13.522 --> 11:16.290
Hi. Um, would you excuse us
for just a second, please?

11:16.358 --> 11:17.825
Okay, but I'll see you later?

11:17.893 --> 11:19.660
All right, I'll talk to
you later, Blondie.

11:20.696 --> 11:22.096
Dude, how hot is that?

11:22.164 --> 11:23.030
Very well done.

11:23.098 --> 11:25.800
Look, there's another situation
developing we need to talk about.

11:25.867 --> 11:27.735
Do you see... see that
guy over there?

11:27.803 --> 11:28.502
Yeah.

11:28.570 --> 11:31.038
Dude, that's Matt Forte... running
back from the Chicago Bears.

11:31.106 --> 11:31.672
The redhead?

11:31.740 --> 11:32.273
No, no, no.

11:32.340 --> 11:34.308
Yeah, it's the other
guy... the black one.

11:34.376 --> 11:35.276
He is shit-faced.

11:35.343 --> 11:36.177
Look at him.

11:36.244 --> 11:37.311
Hold on a second.

11:37.379 --> 11:38.579
Isn't he on your team?

11:38.647 --> 11:40.047
Oh, yeah, he is.

11:40.115 --> 11:41.048
Yeah, whoa.

11:41.116 --> 11:42.249
Oh, that's not cool.

11:42.317 --> 11:44.318
Yeah, and they're playing the
Lions at home tomorrow, man.

11:44.386 --> 11:45.619
He's going to be useless.

11:45.687 --> 11:46.654
What do I do?

11:46.722 --> 11:48.522
Man, I think you know
what you got to do.

11:48.590 --> 11:50.191
You think I should kill him?

11:50.258 --> 11:53.694
No, I was thinking, you
know, you could trade him.

11:53.762 --> 11:55.429
Maybe that's the better
choice, you know.

11:55.497 --> 11:56.130
Okay, okay.

11:56.198 --> 11:56.864
Such a better choice.

11:56.932 --> 11:57.865
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:57.933 --> 11:59.767
Okay, good, all right...
But the lineups lock in,

11:59.835 --> 12:00.668
like, 20 minutes.

12:00.736 --> 12:01.669
So you got to get a move on.

12:01.737 --> 12:03.838
Shit. Okay, got to just get out
of here, go to an Internet

12:03.905 --> 12:05.072
cafe, make the trade.

12:05.140 --> 12:06.140
Get it done, man.

12:06.208 --> 12:08.142
Hey, man, that stuff I said about
killing him, please don't

12:08.210 --> 12:09.376
tell anybody I said that.

12:09.444 --> 12:11.078
Especially if he ends up dead.

12:11.146 --> 12:12.847
Awesome. Thanks so much.

12:12.914 --> 12:14.081
You're welcome.

12:14.149 --> 12:16.717
Hey, Blondie, want
to drive a Porsche?

12:16.785 --> 12:17.818
Oops.

12:17.886 --> 12:19.086
So, what happened?

12:19.154 --> 12:20.688
Uh, basically a success.

12:20.756 --> 12:24.358
A couple of minor casualties...
your car and your girl.

12:24.426 --> 12:26.360
But otherwise, he's gone.

12:26.428 --> 12:27.094
It's good.

12:27.162 --> 12:28.863
Son of a bitch!

12:28.930 --> 12:31.699
Andre... so difficult to please.

12:31.767 --> 12:33.200
Go, go, go, go!

12:33.320 --> 12:35.420
No, no, no. Come back.

12:35.786 --> 12:36.644
Come back!

12:37.770 --> 12:39.444
Get him back here.
You got to get him back.

12:39.564 --> 12:40.875
What, you want him gone,
you want him back.

12:40.942 --> 12:41.876
I'm not a miracle worker.

12:41.943 --> 12:43.811
I don't want him
gone with my car.

12:43.879 --> 12:44.478
It's fine.

12:44.546 --> 12:45.346
He's got your number.

12:45.413 --> 12:46.680
He'll call you back.

12:46.748 --> 12:48.215
I gave him a fake number.

12:48.283 --> 12:50.289
Why would you do that?

12:50.409 --> 12:51.919
'Cause girls do that to me
all the time, you know?

12:51.987 --> 12:52.753
Did it feel good?

12:52.821 --> 12:56.381
It felt really good... till now.

12:59.191 --> 12:59.924
I feel like a new man.

12:59.992 --> 13:00.992
Yeah.

13:01.060 --> 13:01.760
Quick yet effective.

13:01.827 --> 13:03.595
I am quick, you are effective.

13:03.662 --> 13:06.898
You know, babe, I wouldn't even worry
about the whole Taco and Lily thing.

13:06.966 --> 13:09.534
I think it is a blessing in disguise.

13:09.602 --> 13:11.102
Taco is like career kryptonite.

13:11.170 --> 13:13.004
You get dumber just
by being around him.

13:13.072 --> 13:14.339
I love Taco, you know I do.

13:14.407 --> 13:18.372
I just... I think in the end that she's
gonna end up creating a bigger mess

13:18.492 --> 13:19.938
and you're gonna look like a golden boy.

13:21.347 --> 13:22.580
Ew!

13:22.648 --> 13:23.715
Are you okay?

13:23.783 --> 13:24.849
I choked on some water.

13:24.917 --> 13:27.719
Was that the glass that was
sitting right next to the sink?

13:27.787 --> 13:29.220
Yeah.

13:29.288 --> 13:30.155
No.

13:30.222 --> 13:31.389
It hurts down my throat.

13:31.457 --> 13:33.591
You just drank Grammy's earrings.

13:33.659 --> 13:34.159
What?!

13:34.226 --> 13:35.360
Yes.

13:35.428 --> 13:37.829
Damn it, you're going
to have to throw up.

13:37.897 --> 13:41.032
I am not a 16-year-old girl who thinks
she's fat and lives in Florida.

13:41.100 --> 13:41.966
Do you understand me?

13:42.034 --> 13:42.867
I will cut them out of you.

13:42.935 --> 13:46.304
You will... What, this is not
blood diamonds, sweetheart.

13:46.372 --> 13:47.305
They are coming out tonight.

13:47.373 --> 13:52.377
I don't care if we have to spend our
entire grown-up weekend making you vomit.

13:52.445 --> 13:53.244
Come back to bed, Rodney.

13:53.312 --> 13:54.212
I'll be back in a sec.

13:54.280 --> 13:57.882
I'm just grabbing another
bottle of champagne.

13:57.950 --> 14:00.251
What the hell's this?

14:01.720 --> 14:03.855
Why is he offering me Forte?

14:03.923 --> 14:05.023
Are you coming back to bed?

14:05.091 --> 14:06.324
Just a second, baby.

14:06.392 --> 14:08.626
I stubbed my toe.

14:08.694 --> 14:12.630
I miss you, Rodney.

14:12.698 --> 14:14.399
I can have it all.

14:14.467 --> 14:16.401
I deserve it all.

14:16.469 --> 14:18.169
Honey, you've never done this before.

14:18.237 --> 14:19.104
Do you like it?

14:19.171 --> 14:20.004
Yeah. This is unlike you.

14:20.072 --> 14:22.841
Yeah, it's unlike me, but
you know who it isn't like?

14:22.908 --> 14:24.075
The attorney general.

14:24.143 --> 14:24.909
Like the sound of that?

14:24.977 --> 14:26.644
Take me away, Attorney General.

14:26.712 --> 14:27.345
I will.

14:27.413 --> 14:28.646
You're being put away for years.

14:28.714 --> 14:29.647
You know why?

14:29.715 --> 14:31.716
I'm so sorry for whatever I did.

14:31.784 --> 14:35.286
You're under arrest
for being too sexy.

14:35.354 --> 14:36.654
You stay right there.

14:36.722 --> 14:37.689
All right, baby.

14:37.756 --> 14:38.289
All right.

14:38.357 --> 14:39.124
Let's do this thing.

14:39.191 --> 14:40.258
You ready to get into it?

14:40.326 --> 14:41.126
Yeah.

14:41.193 --> 14:43.294
You ready to find out what's going on?

14:43.362 --> 14:44.262
Yeah.

14:44.330 --> 14:44.963
Ooh.

14:45.030 --> 14:46.764
What's next, baby, what's next?

14:46.832 --> 14:48.967
I've got to figure out if
you're ready to play, right?

14:49.034 --> 14:50.101
Yeah.

14:50.169 --> 14:51.469
What's your problem?

14:51.537 --> 14:52.770
Is it your ankle?

14:53.973 --> 14:54.772
Uh-oh.

14:54.840 --> 14:56.674
Could it be... ooh,
is it your meniscus?

14:56.742 --> 14:58.443
Baby, I don't even know
what a meniscus is.

14:58.511 --> 14:59.911
Is it the anterior cruciate ligament?

14:59.979 --> 15:01.679
Can it be a disciplinary problem?

15:01.747 --> 15:02.680
Ooh, yeah.

15:02.748 --> 15:04.682
I've been a bad, bad girl.

15:04.750 --> 15:05.683
Oh, yeah?

15:05.751 --> 15:06.951
You need to be reprimanded?

15:07.019 --> 15:08.253
I need a spanking.

15:08.320 --> 15:09.087
Is that what you want?

15:09.155 --> 15:10.221
Yeah.

15:10.289 --> 15:11.222
Yeah.

15:11.290 --> 15:12.991
Yeah, you've been a bad girl.

15:13.058 --> 15:15.426
Just drink this.

15:18.197 --> 15:19.330
Ew.

15:19.398 --> 15:20.165
Okay.

15:20.232 --> 15:20.798
No.

15:20.866 --> 15:21.432
You good?

15:21.500 --> 15:21.966
Yeah.

15:22.034 --> 15:23.468
You're not going...
I'm fine.

15:23.536 --> 15:24.002
Seriously?

15:24.069 --> 15:26.437
Yeah...
Oh, God!

15:26.505 --> 15:27.138
Did it work?

15:27.206 --> 15:27.906
No.

15:27.973 --> 15:28.806
Are you going to throw up?

15:28.874 --> 15:30.241
No. I just feel hurt.

15:30.309 --> 15:33.166
I'm sorry.
I just... Ow!

15:33.286 --> 15:35.528
I'm doing it because
I want you to throw out.

15:36.237 --> 15:39.459
How is it possible that your stomach
is more stubborn than you are?

15:39.466 --> 15:40.165
I don't know.

15:40.233 --> 15:41.867
Look, it's clearly not working.

15:41.935 --> 15:43.635
We're going to have to try phase two.

15:43.703 --> 15:44.369
No. What's phase two?

15:44.437 --> 15:45.370
It's going out the other end.

15:45.438 --> 15:48.240
No, no, no, I'm not...
B-side, B-side, come on.

15:48.308 --> 15:49.641
I am not a biologist.

15:49.709 --> 15:51.710
I'm not rummaging through my
own feces like a raccoon.

15:51.778 --> 15:52.945
Go.

15:53.012 --> 15:55.380
Aw, I hate phase two.

15:56.068 --> 15:58.169
No, no, no, phase two
is not a public event.

15:58.237 --> 16:00.371
I am pretty sure it was very
public a couple days ago when I

16:00.439 --> 16:01.206
was brushing my teeth.

16:01.273 --> 16:03.341
I have to go downstairs and
listen to O'Connor's speech.

16:03.409 --> 16:04.275
Lily's going to be there.

16:04.343 --> 16:05.510
She's not going to miss it.

16:05.578 --> 16:08.346
Before I get into that stuff
and some of these concerns, I

16:08.414 --> 16:10.748
want to thank all of you for
being here tonight... for taking

16:10.816 --> 16:14.118
time out of your life for being here.

16:14.186 --> 16:17.889
Uh, I want to talk about a couple of
things that concern me personally.

16:17.957 --> 16:18.756
They also concern you.

16:18.824 --> 16:19.791
Babe, I don't feel good.

16:19.858 --> 16:20.558
You're fine.

16:20.626 --> 16:23.027
No, it's all starting to hit me now.

16:23.095 --> 16:26.864
And that you have, is what makes us
a country... - I've got to go to the

16:26.932 --> 16:27.765
bathroom and throw up.

16:27.833 --> 16:28.299
No, no.

16:28.367 --> 16:31.002
You are not going to throw up
Gramma's earrings in a public toilet.

16:31.070 --> 16:32.503
I've got to throw up somewhere.

16:32.571 --> 16:34.339
...Once and for all, we've
got to come up with a plan.

16:34.406 --> 16:35.506
Just breathe.

16:35.574 --> 16:36.774
Relax, you're fine.

16:36.842 --> 16:38.810
Got to get the people in there.

16:38.877 --> 16:40.011
That's where they live.

16:40.079 --> 16:40.878
I'm not fine.

16:40.946 --> 16:42.247
I got to go. I got to go.

16:42.314 --> 16:43.181
Oh, God!

16:47.419 --> 16:49.254
Wait, oh!

16:49.321 --> 16:50.855
Oh, my God, I got 'em!

16:50.923 --> 16:53.324
That totally worked.

16:53.392 --> 16:55.393
Don't know what I'm going
to do with that kid.

16:55.461 --> 16:56.527
Oh, God, we're good.

16:56.595 --> 16:57.528
There's more.

17:01.031 --> 17:02.699
This is too good to be true.

17:02.766 --> 17:03.866
Should I do this?

17:03.934 --> 17:04.867
Do this, baby.

17:04.935 --> 17:05.702
I'm gonna accept it.

17:05.769 --> 17:06.536
Yeah, baby.

17:06.603 --> 17:07.502
You ready to accept it?

17:07.570 --> 17:09.806
Oh, I am, as you see.

17:09.873 --> 17:11.641
I am going to ravage you.

17:11.709 --> 17:13.509
Yeah, baby.

17:13.577 --> 17:14.510
You, too.

17:15.346 --> 17:16.646
All right.

17:16.714 --> 17:17.714
Let's do this, honey.

17:17.781 --> 17:18.714
It is done.

17:18.781 --> 17:19.549
This is exciting.

17:19.616 --> 17:20.782
I can't see you.

17:22.019 --> 17:23.519
Be back in a sec, honey.

17:23.587 --> 17:26.990
♪ Just going ball-deep
On the league. ♪

17:27.057 --> 17:27.991
Ooh, nice leggies.

17:28.058 --> 17:29.525
What are you doing here?

17:29.593 --> 17:32.295
You're not answering your phone
tonight, not checking text messages?

17:32.363 --> 17:33.129
No, I'm not.

17:33.197 --> 17:34.097
Okay, here's the situation.

17:34.164 --> 17:34.931
Your brother stole my car.

17:34.999 --> 17:35.765
He's not my brother.

17:35.833 --> 17:36.599
Brolo El Cuñado.

17:36.667 --> 17:38.601
If he has sex in that car,
you're buying me a new one.

17:38.669 --> 17:40.303
Well, someone will finally
have sex in that car.

17:40.371 --> 17:42.538
I went down on a
girl in that car.

17:42.606 --> 17:43.773
That wasn't a girl.

17:43.841 --> 17:45.541
Yes, Turner's syndrome, XXY.

17:45.609 --> 17:46.642
Don't worry about that.

17:46.710 --> 17:49.912
This idiot told your brolo that
some drunk dude at a party was

17:49.980 --> 17:52.964
Matt Forte and he'd better drop him
cause he's too drunk to play tomorrow.

17:53.084 --> 17:55.677
- Did you?
- ***

17:55.797 --> 17:57.820
Uno's and we told Andre it was
Anquan Boldin?

17:57.888 --> 17:59.822
Anquan. Quan... Asian name.

17:59.890 --> 18:01.657
Michelle Kwan. All right?

18:01.725 --> 18:03.469
Rodney.

18:03.589 --> 18:05.340
Come to bed.

18:05.588 --> 18:06.888
Yeah, in a second, sweetie.

18:06.956 --> 18:08.957
What you got going
on back there?

18:09.025 --> 18:09.925
It's Terrific Lady Night.

18:09.992 --> 18:11.093
Ugh!

18:11.160 --> 18:13.528
It's not Terrific Lady and Two
Assholes Night, so get out!

18:13.596 --> 18:14.963
What are you looking at?

18:15.031 --> 18:16.098
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!

18:16.165 --> 18:17.532
You picked up Matt Forte?

18:17.600 --> 18:18.500
I'm playing him tomorrow.

18:18.568 --> 18:21.203
He's now gonna destroy me
'cause he's got Forte.

18:21.270 --> 18:22.671
Yeah, it's gonna be a savaging.

18:22.739 --> 18:25.140
You did a trade during
Terrific Lady Night.

18:25.208 --> 18:26.341
Well done!

18:26.409 --> 18:26.908
Thank you.

18:26.976 --> 18:27.709
Drop him.

18:27.777 --> 18:28.276
Leave!

18:28.344 --> 18:29.177
Drop him.

18:29.245 --> 18:30.145
Leave.

18:30.213 --> 18:31.279
What's it gonna be, guys?

18:31.347 --> 18:32.314
Good night, gentlemen.

18:32.382 --> 18:33.215
Okay.

18:33.282 --> 18:34.015
See you later.

18:34.083 --> 18:34.916
Rodney!

18:34.984 --> 18:36.918
Hey, hey, hey, no, I'm
coming right here, baby.

18:36.986 --> 18:37.719
What happened?

18:37.787 --> 18:38.620
I'm right here, baby.

18:38.688 --> 18:40.188
What happened to
Terrific Lady Day?

18:40.256 --> 18:42.157
Oh, it's still
Terrific Lady Day.

18:42.225 --> 18:44.159
Mmm...
Mmm, here I am.

18:44.227 --> 18:46.598
Mmm-mmm.

18:50.115 --> 18:52.343
Honey, where are you?

18:52.471 --> 18:53.664
I'm right here, baby.

18:53.732 --> 18:54.565
Where?

18:54.633 --> 18:55.332
I'm right here.

18:55.400 --> 18:56.333
Don't you want me?

18:56.401 --> 18:57.968
Yeah, I'll make you beg for it.

18:58.036 --> 18:59.970
Yeah, you're my little...
Come on, baby, bring it.

19:00.038 --> 19:02.006
I'm touching you with rose
petals because if anybody

19:02.073 --> 19:05.176
else touched you, I would take
their nuts and put 'em in a

19:05.243 --> 19:07.745
beanbag and then let fat
people sit on them.

19:07.813 --> 19:09.680
Okay, baby, you don't
have to get upset.

19:09.748 --> 19:11.015
Okay? I'm not gonna do it.

19:11.082 --> 19:12.550
You're getting so
emotional, honey.

19:12.617 --> 19:14.218
I'm a bit emotional right now.

19:14.286 --> 19:16.720
I don't mind if you cry
during sex again.

19:16.788 --> 19:17.988
I like it.

19:18.056 --> 19:19.290
I don't cry during sex.

19:19.357 --> 19:20.424
Yes, you do.

19:20.492 --> 19:21.992
It's just that I'm allergic.

19:22.060 --> 19:24.395
I have sensitive eyes, okay?

19:24.463 --> 19:25.729
That's the issue.

19:25.797 --> 19:28.732
Come on, baby, bring
those tears over here.

19:28.800 --> 19:30.768
Come get it. Come get mama.

19:30.836 --> 19:34.138
Oh, you put on some
corduroy pants, huh?

19:34.206 --> 19:36.307
No, I just put on
pants for a second.

19:36.374 --> 19:38.075
I'm gonna take 'em off
in just a second.

19:38.143 --> 19:39.076
Naughty boy.

19:39.144 --> 19:40.711
No, no, I'm leaving 'em on!

19:40.779 --> 19:42.012
I'm leaving the pants on, okay?

19:42.080 --> 19:43.047
Making it tough for mama.

19:43.114 --> 19:45.015
I don't like that when you
put that there at all.

19:45.083 --> 19:46.317
I know that you like this.

19:46.384 --> 19:48.719
No, no, no, oh, I don't
like that at all.

19:48.787 --> 19:50.054
Oh, oh, yes, you do.

19:50.121 --> 19:52.323
You love it when I put it there.

19:52.390 --> 19:55.824
Fine. I will do this, but I'm
gonna get even with you.

19:55.944 --> 19:58.028
Okay.

19:58.096 --> 20:00.231
Okay, are we happy now?

20:00.298 --> 20:03.067
Where? Honey?!

20:03.134 --> 20:05.569
We are filthy.

20:05.637 --> 20:07.725
We are horrible.
Get out. Go.

20:08.522 --> 20:11.133
Hello? Ruxin?

20:12.071 --> 20:13.084
Go!

20:13.204 --> 20:14.378
Ah, here we go.

20:14.446 --> 20:15.846
You guys know where Andre is?

20:15.914 --> 20:16.580
Whoa-ho, look at this!

20:16.648 --> 20:17.415
Are you kidding me?

20:17.482 --> 20:18.516
Raffi, what are you doing here?!

20:18.583 --> 20:19.984
I gotta give Andre
his car back.

20:20.052 --> 20:21.419
Relax, man, you don't
have to cover her up.

20:21.486 --> 20:23.087
We shared a room
till we were 18.

20:23.155 --> 20:23.854
Oh, God!

20:23.922 --> 20:26.691
Fella, I need to thank you for
making that trade just now.

20:26.759 --> 20:28.593
You made a trade on
Terrific Lady Day?

20:29.428 --> 20:31.429
No, I didn't make a trade
on Terrific Lady Day!

20:31.497 --> 20:32.363
I would never do that!

20:32.431 --> 20:33.097
I swear to God.

20:33.165 --> 20:34.199
I think I'm gonna barf.

20:34.266 --> 20:34.933
Oh, my God!

20:35.000 --> 20:36.201
All these candles
are all vanilla.

20:36.268 --> 20:38.069
That triggers a gag
reflex in me.

20:38.137 --> 20:38.937
Get out of here!

20:39.004 --> 20:40.371
I gotta lie down for a second.

20:40.940 --> 20:42.373
Sometimes when I puke, I shit.

20:42.441 --> 20:42.907
No!

20:42.975 --> 20:43.675
Raffi!

20:43.742 --> 20:45.677
He's having a very special
night with his wife.

20:45.744 --> 20:48.079
And you, my friend, got a
little foot jibber from Sofia.

What a night!

20:49.081 --> 20:50.478

20:50.598 --> 20:53.348
- Alright!

20:53.446 --> 20:55.979
- Holy...
- El Cunado.

20:56.112 --> 21:06.067
