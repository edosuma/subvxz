WEBVTT

00:04.094 --> 00:06.220
Ooh, Jen, smells wonderful in here.

00:06.222 --> 00:08.555
Thanks. I told the geology club

00:08.557 --> 00:10.241
the motto for our bake sale is

00:10.243 --> 00:13.268
"If you want to make dough, make dough".

00:13.270 --> 00:16.563
(CHUCKLES) Ooh, a club
that loves puns. Ah.

00:16.565 --> 00:18.529
Well, I wish I could stay and help you,

00:18.531 --> 00:20.637
but I just don't have the, um...

00:20.639 --> 00:22.828
the thyme. (LAUGHS)

00:22.830 --> 00:26.114
You're running for office...
you have a lot to do.

00:26.116 --> 00:29.451
Plus, Mr. Baxter is really
looking forward to helping.

00:29.453 --> 00:31.596
Mm. Well, I've known him a long time,

00:31.598 --> 00:34.065
and he's not.

00:34.067 --> 00:35.900
Hey, Jen. I got the afternoon off,

00:35.902 --> 00:38.753
so we can teach that
geology club that you rock!

00:38.755 --> 00:39.945
VANESSA: Oh, hey, no.

00:39.947 --> 00:41.089
Uh-uh.

00:41.091 --> 00:43.925
Puns are our thing.

00:43.927 --> 00:46.169
It's nice that you're excited to help.

00:46.171 --> 00:48.245
Yeah. I get to teach
the capitalism I love

00:48.247 --> 00:50.557
to a teenager that I... tolerate.

00:51.918 --> 00:53.459
I'm so excited.

00:53.461 --> 00:54.752
When's the first lesson?

00:54.754 --> 00:55.795
Right now.

00:55.797 --> 00:57.254
I'd love one of these muffins.

00:57.256 --> 01:00.183
Oh, okay. Here you go.

01:00.185 --> 01:02.068
- You're selling them, right?
- Yes.

01:03.780 --> 01:05.930
How much... are you selling them for?

01:05.932 --> 01:07.115
Oh, right.

01:07.117 --> 01:08.432
Four dollars.

01:08.434 --> 01:10.785
Um...

01:10.787 --> 01:12.495
I'm-I'm hungry.

01:15.700 --> 01:17.200
Okay.

01:17.202 --> 01:18.943
Give me four dollars and start eating.

01:18.945 --> 01:20.203
MIKE: No.

01:20.205 --> 01:22.113
I'm starving.

01:22.115 --> 01:23.656
He's starving

01:23.658 --> 01:26.992
for that particular muffin.

01:26.994 --> 01:30.287
Oh, I meant $100.

01:30.289 --> 01:32.548
Yeah.

01:32.550 --> 01:34.434
I'm starving, I'm not an idiot.

01:36.337 --> 01:38.355
Fine, then ten. But
that's the lowest I'll go.

01:38.357 --> 01:39.981
- Yes.
- (LAUGHS)

01:39.983 --> 01:41.298
Wow, that was fun.

01:41.300 --> 01:43.393
- Why am I shaking?
- Whoa, whoa.

01:43.395 --> 01:45.653
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
That's a money high.

01:45.655 --> 01:47.397
The sweet buzz of capitalism.

01:47.399 --> 01:48.823
Thank you.

01:48.825 --> 01:50.766
Hey, where's my money?

01:50.768 --> 01:52.494
Think of me as the government.

01:52.496 --> 01:54.162
Just add it to the debt.

02:02.363 --> 02:05.006
You know, if the geology
club wins this competition,

02:05.008 --> 02:07.250
- we get to choose our own field trip.
- Ooh.

02:07.252 --> 02:09.919
And we picked the Grand Canyon.

02:09.920 --> 02:11.996
You guys live in
Colorado, just go outside,

02:11.998 --> 02:15.350
look at the mountains
and then go to Vegas.

02:15.352 --> 02:18.377
I can't wait to finally
beat the chemistry club.

02:18.379 --> 02:19.879
And it will all be thanks

02:19.881 --> 02:23.024
to the Mike Baxter School of Business.

02:23.026 --> 02:25.384
Way too long. It should
be "Mike Baxter...

02:25.386 --> 02:28.488
S.O.B".

02:28.490 --> 02:31.088
Okay, our product is
now ready for purchase.

02:31.090 --> 02:33.559
- What's next?
- Okay, next lesson.

02:33.561 --> 02:37.002
Number two is geographical advantage.

02:37.004 --> 02:39.453
I'm guessing that means
finding the perfect place

02:39.455 --> 02:40.783
for me to set up my stand.

02:40.785 --> 02:42.452
Bingo.

02:42.454 --> 02:44.120
It would be good business
to sell surfboards

02:44.122 --> 02:45.955
and Spam in Hawaii,

02:45.957 --> 02:47.865
and good business to sell dunce caps

02:47.867 --> 02:50.534
at Democratic conventions.

02:50.536 --> 02:53.500
Okay, okay. So I need to find a place

02:53.502 --> 02:56.057
where people will
really want baked goods.

02:56.059 --> 02:58.250
Your teachers must love you.

02:58.252 --> 03:00.753
Where in Denver

03:00.755 --> 03:03.088
will we find people with the munchies

03:03.090 --> 03:06.091
that don't mind paying
(SINGSONGY): high prices?

03:06.093 --> 03:09.094
At Bud's Buds.

03:09.096 --> 03:11.555
- Mr. Baxter, you are a genius.
- (CHUCKLES)

03:11.557 --> 03:14.826
Yeah. Well, a genius would
know to put the seat down.

03:17.747 --> 03:19.655
What did he do today?

03:19.657 --> 03:23.159
He came up with the perfect
place for my bake sale.

03:23.161 --> 03:24.919
That's right. I'll give Ryan a call,

03:24.921 --> 03:26.570
and we'll set up in
front of the pot shop.

03:26.572 --> 03:29.073
Oh... So the geology club gets to go

03:29.075 --> 03:32.952
to the Grand Canyon
because of "stoners".

03:32.954 --> 03:34.596
(BOTH LAUGHING)

03:34.598 --> 03:36.097
You know, puns are our thing.

03:39.418 --> 03:41.377
This is all so exciting.

03:41.379 --> 03:43.771
I can't wait for my next lesson

03:43.773 --> 03:46.608
with "Mike Baxter... S.O.B".

03:52.449 --> 03:55.658
He must've left the
seat up for her, too.

04:07.205 --> 04:08.963
Pour.

04:08.965 --> 04:11.115
Guys, guys, big news.

04:11.117 --> 04:12.658
Kyle finally picked a college.

04:12.660 --> 04:15.828
- Whoa.
- Oh. Hallelujah.

04:15.830 --> 04:18.632
I was gonna drink to nothing,
but I'll drink to that.

04:18.635 --> 04:20.216
Yeah.

04:20.218 --> 04:23.052
We've been listening to Kyle
agonize over this decision

04:23.054 --> 04:25.388
- every lunch hour for-for weeks.
- Mm-hmm.

04:25.390 --> 04:27.690
Oh, really? Every lunch hour?

04:29.135 --> 04:30.893
Kyle talks about it during dinner,

04:30.895 --> 04:32.845
when we're getting ready
for bed, and after we...

04:32.847 --> 04:36.473
Uh, he talks about it a lot.

04:36.475 --> 04:38.274
Does he talk to you about it
while you're trying to drink?

04:38.276 --> 04:40.644
Because that's annoying.

04:40.646 --> 04:42.738
- Well, look, he is on his way here now...
- What's this?

04:42.740 --> 04:44.123
... to tell us he finally chose

04:44.125 --> 04:45.482
- Brooksdale College.
- (WHOOPS)

04:45.484 --> 04:47.501
And we are going to support that 100%.

04:47.503 --> 04:48.819
- Ooh!
- That's great.

04:48.821 --> 04:50.696
This decision has to stick...
do you understand me?

04:50.698 --> 04:52.173
Do you understand me?!

04:52.175 --> 04:53.841
Yeah, right. T-Totally.

04:53.843 --> 04:56.803
(OVERLAPPING CHEERS)

04:58.423 --> 05:00.998
Thank you! Uh, so long,
other college brochures.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.925
I'll miss your photos
of sunlit classrooms

05:02.927 --> 05:05.436
and ethnically diverse Frisbee teams.

05:07.765 --> 05:09.691
What's going on? I heard cheers.

05:09.693 --> 05:12.193
Usually that only happens
when I <i> leave</i> a room.

05:12.195 --> 05:15.179
Kyle finally picked a college.

05:15.181 --> 05:16.259
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- (WHOOPS)

05:16.261 --> 05:17.940
He is going to Brooksdale.

05:17.942 --> 05:20.059
Brooksdale, huh? Well, that's a...

05:20.061 --> 05:22.278
that's a choice, I guess.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.637
What-what does that mean?

05:24.639 --> 05:26.203
Oh, he's kidding or stupid.

05:26.205 --> 05:28.543
Either way, we don't listen.

05:28.545 --> 05:31.637
You, uh, you didn't send them any money

05:31.639 --> 05:32.871
or anything already, did you?

05:32.873 --> 05:34.123
What? Why?

05:34.125 --> 05:35.866
Don't listen to Joe.

05:35.868 --> 05:38.243
He's only an expert on one thing...

05:38.245 --> 05:40.371
nothing.

05:40.373 --> 05:42.256
Which is still more than your average

05:42.258 --> 05:44.449
Brooksdale graduate, huh?

05:44.451 --> 05:46.832
Joe, Kyle wants to go there,

05:46.834 --> 05:48.337
and we want Kyle to go there.

05:48.339 --> 05:50.445
So shut up.

05:50.447 --> 05:52.969
Look, fine, look, forget
I said anything, okay?

05:52.971 --> 05:54.477
My blood sugar's low.

05:54.479 --> 05:56.904
I haven't had my
before-dinner doughnut yet.

05:58.908 --> 06:00.816
I-I don't know.

06:00.818 --> 06:02.985
Maybe Brooksdale isn't the
perfect choice, after all.

06:02.987 --> 06:04.103
What?

06:04.105 --> 06:05.321
I'm gonna reopen the search.

06:05.323 --> 06:08.082
It's gonna be a long night.

06:08.084 --> 06:09.942
I'll be right back.

06:09.944 --> 06:12.337
Someone's about to choke on
his before-dinner doughnut.

06:14.591 --> 06:16.448
That Mandy.

06:16.450 --> 06:18.384
Always trying to save a life.

06:23.174 --> 06:26.934
That's four Rice Krispie treats,
three brownies and a lemon bar.

06:30.515 --> 06:32.523
You already paid me.

06:35.594 --> 06:37.928
Baked goods... get it?

06:37.930 --> 06:40.198
(INHALES) Baked good.

06:43.310 --> 06:45.102
Principal Larabee.

06:45.104 --> 06:47.546
Welcome to Jen's Table
of Tantalizing Treats.

06:47.548 --> 06:49.031
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Carol.

06:49.033 --> 06:50.958
What are you doing
here? I never took you

06:50.960 --> 06:53.294
for a fan of the devil's lettuce.

06:53.296 --> 06:55.296
Officially?

06:55.298 --> 06:56.298
No.

06:57.425 --> 06:59.652
No, I-I heard Jen had set up shop

06:59.654 --> 07:02.470
outside of a dispensary, and
I had to come see it for myself.

07:02.472 --> 07:04.329
Here's a fun fact... gluten-free, right?

07:04.331 --> 07:06.307
So the stoners think
they're getting a deal

07:06.309 --> 07:08.810
because they don't have
to pay for the gluten.

07:10.480 --> 07:12.480
I'm telling you, Principal Larabee,

07:12.482 --> 07:14.006
as long as I'm selling here,

07:14.008 --> 07:16.467
this contest is as good as over.

07:16.469 --> 07:19.511
Well, that's great news
for the chemistry club

07:19.513 --> 07:21.013
because you <i> can't</i> sell here anymore.

07:21.015 --> 07:22.181
What?

07:22.183 --> 07:24.016
It's not a good image for our school.

07:24.018 --> 07:26.518
Well, neither is a football
team that goes 0-10

07:26.520 --> 07:28.996
in a nine-game season.

07:29.806 --> 07:32.238
Jen, if you want to
stay in this contest,

07:32.240 --> 07:33.760
you got to sell your
baked goods elsewhere.

07:33.762 --> 07:36.464
Whoa, whoa, C-Carol! Carol,
hold on a second, hold on a second.

07:36.466 --> 07:38.605
You're aware that weed is legal?

07:38.607 --> 07:40.824
She's not doing anything wrong here.

07:40.826 --> 07:43.035
Mr. Baxter, this is my business.

07:43.037 --> 07:44.661
- I'll handle it.
- Okay.

07:44.663 --> 07:46.224
How big of a taste do you need

07:46.226 --> 07:47.386
to forget you were ever here?

07:49.001 --> 07:50.017
I'm sorry, Jen.

07:50.019 --> 07:52.019
Shut it down.

07:58.770 --> 08:02.104
So what does baloney have
to do with fighting the man?

08:02.106 --> 08:04.699
I think it's the nitrates.

08:04.701 --> 08:06.651
Rumor has it,

08:06.653 --> 08:08.843
when Napoleon admitted
defeat to the Russians,

08:08.845 --> 08:10.613
he turned to his generals and he said,

08:10.615 --> 08:14.024
"Oh,<i> mon dieu!</i> No baloney".

08:14.026 --> 08:15.734
Got it.

08:15.736 --> 08:18.237
So, what's our game plan
at the school board meeting?

08:18.239 --> 08:20.139
There'll be a couple
hours of stuff going on

08:20.141 --> 08:22.792
even C-SPAN wouldn't show.

08:22.794 --> 08:25.284
And then they open up the
floor to civilians like us.

08:25.286 --> 08:26.796
We give them the what for.

08:26.798 --> 08:30.332
- What's a "what for"?
- That's where you kick ass.

08:30.334 --> 08:32.006
You haven't broken any laws,

08:32.008 --> 08:33.210
there's no reason to shut you down.

08:33.212 --> 08:34.970
- We're like superheroes.
- Yes.

08:34.972 --> 08:37.565
Maybe someday people will
make a movie about us.

08:37.567 --> 08:39.308
Yeah, yeah. Animated ones.

08:39.309 --> 08:41.943
I like the animated
ones with-with spacemen.

08:43.638 --> 08:45.035
Hey.

08:45.037 --> 08:46.557
Hey, baby.

08:46.559 --> 08:49.151
- Oh, you're eating baloney.
- Mm-hmm.

08:49.153 --> 08:51.520
Who are you fighting?

08:51.522 --> 08:54.398
We're headed to the school board meeting

08:54.400 --> 08:56.334
to slap them with a for what.

08:57.587 --> 08:59.444
Did I do that right?

08:59.446 --> 09:01.405
(STAMMERS) Language evolves.

09:01.407 --> 09:04.241
Why, uh, why are you
fighting the school board?

09:04.243 --> 09:06.836
Principal Larabee said I can't
sell outside the pot shop.

09:06.838 --> 09:08.763
Oh, no. No, really?

09:08.765 --> 09:11.782
Yeah, got a complaint
from some lame-o parent

09:11.784 --> 09:14.209
turned... (BLOWS) ... whistleblower.

09:16.130 --> 09:19.682
But we're gonna keep the
"free" in free market.

09:19.684 --> 09:21.737
Uh, yeah. Yeah. Well, you know what?

09:21.739 --> 09:24.019
Maybe-maybe don't take
it to the school board.

09:24.021 --> 09:25.855
Too late... I've already
got the baloney in me.

09:25.857 --> 09:27.217
The rocket is primed, ready to go.

09:29.119 --> 09:31.526
Mr. Baxter said there's
no greater thrill

09:31.528 --> 09:33.086
than being told, "You're out of order!"

09:33.088 --> 09:35.413
- Yeah, you're out of order.
- You're out of order.

09:35.415 --> 09:37.822
Yeah, you're out of order, yeah.
We got to get going, man.

09:37.824 --> 09:40.056
Before the magic of that
processed meat wears off.

09:40.058 --> 09:42.154
Yeah. No, Mike. Stop, stop,
stop, stop. Yeah, no, uh...

09:42.156 --> 09:44.281
The-the school board doesn't
know anything about this.

09:44.283 --> 09:47.784
Uh, Carol shut you down because of me.

09:47.786 --> 09:50.263
- What?
- You're the whistleblower?

09:52.216 --> 09:55.378
I mentioned to Carol that you
were selling at the pot shop

09:55.380 --> 09:56.978
because I thought it was a cool idea.

09:56.980 --> 09:58.980
- She didn't.
- Why?

09:58.982 --> 10:01.430
Well, she thought it
might hurt my campaign

10:01.432 --> 10:02.674
if Slattery heard about it.

10:02.676 --> 10:04.778
Like, he-he's known for
smearing his opponents.

10:04.780 --> 10:06.520
You know, when you think about it,

10:06.522 --> 10:08.564
- it actually makes some sense.
- Yeah.

10:08.566 --> 10:10.900
Jen, we're not going anywhere.

10:10.902 --> 10:13.351
Honey, look. Uh... Carol didn't tell me

10:13.353 --> 10:14.803
what she was gonna do. I'm so sorry.

10:14.805 --> 10:16.855
I-I didn't know she
was gonna shut you down.

10:16.857 --> 10:19.983
You guys just better not piss me off.

10:19.985 --> 10:22.879
Because I-I've got a
belly full of baloney.

10:26.509 --> 10:28.083
You guys wanted to see me?

10:28.085 --> 10:29.719
You're damn right we did.

10:29.721 --> 10:31.577
What the hell were you doing,

10:31.579 --> 10:34.373
scrambling up Kyle's brains
over this college thing?

10:34.375 --> 10:36.620
Yeah, kid's brain comes scrambled.

10:36.622 --> 10:38.928
He doesn't need your help.

10:38.930 --> 10:41.096
Forgive me for looking
out for the guy, all right?

10:41.098 --> 10:43.006
I like him. He reminds me of Doug...

10:43.008 --> 10:46.176
the only dog I ever liked.

10:46.178 --> 10:48.986
We held Kyle's hand for weeks

10:48.988 --> 10:51.678
while he agonized over
picking the perfect college.

10:51.680 --> 10:52.999
Yeah, yeah. And where do you get off

10:53.001 --> 10:55.394
badmouthing Brooksdale College anyway?

10:55.396 --> 10:56.445
I know the place.

10:56.447 --> 10:58.372
I used to teach there.

10:59.408 --> 11:00.625
- What?
- What?

11:02.378 --> 11:05.120
I-Is this some kind
of Make-A-Wish thing?

11:05.122 --> 11:08.624
I was a professor in
the English department.

11:08.626 --> 11:10.200
<i>- What?
- What?</i>

11:10.202 --> 11:11.460
(SIGHS)

11:11.462 --> 11:14.246
Brooksdale is fine for
20th Century America,

11:14.248 --> 11:17.466
but Brit Lit... pish and posh.

11:17.468 --> 11:19.301
No. No.

11:19.303 --> 11:22.757
No, no. You-you barely speak English.

11:22.759 --> 11:24.256
There's-there's no way you taught it.

11:24.258 --> 11:25.733
You don't know everything about me.

11:25.735 --> 11:28.978
- Well, we know you're a bonehead.
- Yeah.

11:28.980 --> 11:31.596
Look, I didn't plan on
being an academic, okay?

11:31.598 --> 11:34.149
But I ended up at Dartmouth
after my book was published.

11:34.151 --> 11:36.226
- Dartmouth?
- Book?

11:36.228 --> 11:37.561
It got a lot of attention.

11:37.563 --> 11:39.271
Critics called it a revelation.

11:39.273 --> 11:41.490
It dealt with themes of perception,

11:41.492 --> 11:45.327
existential angst and alienation.

11:45.329 --> 11:47.755
And-and this-this book was called...

11:47.757 --> 11:49.298
<i>What the Cat Sees.</i>

11:51.359 --> 11:52.533
It's a kids' book.

11:52.535 --> 11:53.995
At least, that's what
it was about for me.

11:53.997 --> 11:55.029
But critics, you know...

11:55.031 --> 11:56.955
W-Well, I know what you're gonna do.

11:56.957 --> 11:58.933
You're-you're gonna go talk to Kyle.

11:58.935 --> 12:00.342
That's right. You scrambled him up...

12:00.344 --> 12:02.177
you're gonna put the
pieces back together.

12:02.179 --> 12:04.421
That's what we call a mixed metaphor.

12:04.423 --> 12:06.488
Where'd you go to
college, Ed, Brooksdale?

12:06.490 --> 12:08.296
Wait, wait, wait.

12:08.298 --> 12:09.612
Wait a minute, wait a
minute, wait a minute.

12:09.614 --> 12:11.762
<i>What-What the Cat Sees?</i> (CHUCKLES)

12:11.764 --> 12:15.357
I used to read that book to
Brandon when he was little.

12:15.359 --> 12:17.768
You're Professor Puddle?

12:17.770 --> 12:20.579
(ENGLISH ACCENT): At your service, sir.

12:25.182 --> 12:27.256
Principal Larabee
didn't even mention you

12:27.258 --> 12:28.612
when she shut us down.

12:28.614 --> 12:32.374
She's just trying to keep
her candidate's hands clean.

12:32.376 --> 12:34.506
(A LA BRANDO): The Godfather
doesn't need to know

12:34.508 --> 12:36.679
the details.

12:36.681 --> 12:39.240
I don't know. I-I think she
was just trying to eliminate

12:39.242 --> 12:41.291
a problem before it became a problem.

12:41.293 --> 12:43.218
You'd think a woman that
thinks that far ahead

12:43.220 --> 12:45.062
wouldn't have married Chuck.

12:46.306 --> 12:48.186
I need a new plan.

12:48.188 --> 12:50.801
I've only got 24 hours
to outsell chem club.

12:50.803 --> 12:54.210
Okay, what business lessons
have we learned so far?

12:54.212 --> 12:56.660
- Price point, geographic advantage,
- Mm-hmm.

12:56.662 --> 12:58.016
fighting the Man.

12:58.018 --> 13:00.227
Check, check and check.

13:01.704 --> 13:03.835
We got this far. Now
it's time to bear down

13:03.837 --> 13:05.166
- and really focus, okay?
- Right.

13:05.168 --> 13:08.419
- We need to maximize profit and minimize time.
- Okay.

13:08.421 --> 13:10.171
Where are we gonna sell?

13:10.173 --> 13:12.364
(EXHALES) Back to the pot shop.

13:12.366 --> 13:13.657
Right.

13:13.659 --> 13:15.751
Even though Carol shut us down,

13:15.753 --> 13:18.328
Slattery may find out about you

13:18.330 --> 13:20.589
and Slattery may hurt Vanessa?

13:20.591 --> 13:22.850
Check, check and check.

13:24.261 --> 13:25.427
Wow.

13:25.429 --> 13:27.271
Who's the S.O.B. now?

13:34.197 --> 13:36.213
Hey, Mike Baxter for Outdoor Man

13:36.215 --> 13:38.014
to talk about one of
my favorite passions.

13:38.016 --> 13:39.775
No, no, no, not gutting a deer

13:39.777 --> 13:42.036
while listening to the Lovin' Spoonful.

13:43.188 --> 13:46.064
I'm talking about capitalism.

13:46.066 --> 13:49.210
Now, old Bernie and young
Elizabeth tell the folks

13:49.212 --> 13:52.797
capitalists are coldhearted,
money-grubbing vultures.

13:53.716 --> 13:55.407
When you put it that way,

13:55.409 --> 13:56.867
you make it sound like a bad thing.

13:56.869 --> 13:58.961
(CHUCKLES)

13:58.963 --> 14:01.637
But we're also human
beings with a conscience.

14:01.639 --> 14:03.311
Conscience. You remember those?

14:03.313 --> 14:05.227
It's that little annoying
voice that wakes you up

14:05.229 --> 14:06.918
in the middle of the
night saying, "Mike, Mike,

14:06.920 --> 14:08.587
did you really have to flip the bird

14:08.589 --> 14:10.898
to that old lady who cut you off?"

14:12.532 --> 14:14.647
I did. How else was she gonna know

14:14.649 --> 14:17.262
that I had the right of way?!

14:17.264 --> 14:20.288
Besides, the truck was
slammed with a dual exhaust.

14:20.290 --> 14:23.435
Who thought an old woman
would be driving that thing?

14:23.437 --> 14:25.733
But the evolved capitalist should listen

14:25.735 --> 14:27.522
to that little voice
every once in a while.

14:27.524 --> 14:29.274
You know, there's actual laws that say

14:29.276 --> 14:32.302
a seven-year-old can't
operate a saw in a lumber mill.

14:32.304 --> 14:33.469
You know why?

14:33.471 --> 14:35.273
Because some jackass way back when

14:35.275 --> 14:37.569
actually had a
seven-year-old operating a saw

14:37.571 --> 14:39.242
in a lumber mill.

14:39.244 --> 14:41.859
Just imagine the workers
complaining back then.

14:41.861 --> 14:44.789
(HIGH-PITCHED): "Boy, what
a long day it was, huh, guys?

14:44.791 --> 14:47.959
"I can't wait to get home and
roll my tire down the street

14:47.961 --> 14:50.104
with a stick".

14:50.106 --> 14:52.964
I mean, sure, paying your
workers with baseball cards

14:52.966 --> 14:54.851
and bubble gum would increase profits,

14:54.853 --> 14:56.801
but it's wrong!

14:56.803 --> 14:59.827
Listen, a good boss should
know how to make a buck

14:59.829 --> 15:01.202
and still be a human being.

15:01.204 --> 15:02.836
You see, capitalism,

15:02.838 --> 15:05.437
it's just a recipe for economic success,

15:05.439 --> 15:06.971
and it doesn't taste quite right

15:06.973 --> 15:09.712
until you sprinkle in a little morality.

15:09.714 --> 15:12.547
That's why, here at Outdoor
Man, we provide benefits

15:12.549 --> 15:14.945
for our part-timers, paid medical leave

15:14.947 --> 15:17.590
and all-you-can-eat chili
at the Annual Meat Summit.

15:19.543 --> 15:23.012
Which sadly leads to a
lot of paid medical leave.

15:24.831 --> 15:26.807
Happy employees make good employees,

15:26.809 --> 15:29.041
and that's good business.

15:29.043 --> 15:31.477
Baxter out.

15:35.008 --> 15:36.150
Oh. Hey, Joe.

15:36.152 --> 15:38.067
Hey, Kyle. What are you reading?

15:38.069 --> 15:40.426
Oh, I'm just rereading all
these college brochures.

15:40.428 --> 15:42.156
I'm scared I'm gonna make
the wrong choice again.

15:42.158 --> 15:45.492
Oh. Sounds important.
Don't let me bother you.

15:51.358 --> 15:54.335
Um, what are <i> you</i> reading?

15:54.337 --> 15:55.986
Oh, it's a kids' book

15:55.988 --> 15:58.464
called <i> What the Cat Sees.</i>

15:59.533 --> 16:00.916
What's it about?

16:00.918 --> 16:04.202
It's about a cat

16:04.204 --> 16:05.870
and what he sees.

16:05.872 --> 16:07.014
Oh. Yeah, okay.

16:07.016 --> 16:09.040
I could, uh...

16:09.042 --> 16:10.709
I could read it to you if you want.

16:10.711 --> 16:12.094
Oh, really? Yeah.

16:12.096 --> 16:14.004
- Yeah, my mom used to read to me when I was little.
- Oh.

16:14.006 --> 16:18.058
Mostly from the <i> Mr. Boston's
Bartending Guide.</i>

16:18.060 --> 16:21.928
I was the only third grader
who could make a sloe gin fizz.

16:21.930 --> 16:24.454
"Magellan the cat walked to his bed.

16:24.456 --> 16:26.700
Then he stopped! Something
was very, very wrong".

16:26.702 --> 16:30.320
Oh, this book starts like gangbusters!

16:30.322 --> 16:32.720
"Magellan's old cat bed was gone.

16:32.722 --> 16:34.041
In its place was a new bed.

16:34.043 --> 16:35.525
Magellan didn't want to go to it.

16:35.527 --> 16:37.452
White Dog laughed at him.

16:37.454 --> 16:39.370
(DEEP VOICE): 'You're afraid
'cause you're a Fraidy Cat',

16:39.372 --> 16:41.204
said White Dog". See this?

16:41.206 --> 16:42.330
Oh. (SCOFFS)

16:43.743 --> 16:45.173
Stupid dog.

16:45.175 --> 16:46.295
Yeah.

16:46.297 --> 16:48.297
"Yellow Bird laughed at him.

16:48.299 --> 16:50.206
(HIGH-PITCHED): 'You're scared
'cause you're a Scaredy Cat',

16:50.208 --> 16:51.300
said Yellow Bird".

16:51.302 --> 16:52.302
See this?

16:54.755 --> 16:57.973
What is it with birds and their insults?

16:57.975 --> 16:59.931
"Magellan was too nervous
to sleep in his new bed,

16:59.933 --> 17:02.377
so he laid down on the cold floor".

17:02.379 --> 17:05.281
The end? That is the
saddest book in the world.

17:05.284 --> 17:07.824
How did you learn to
make a sloe gin fizz

17:07.826 --> 17:09.201
when you won't stop yakking?

17:11.156 --> 17:13.347
"Then Brown Mouse
walked over to Magellan".

17:13.348 --> 17:15.307
Oh, don't eat him. Don't
eat him. Don't eat him.

17:17.161 --> 17:19.234
"Brown Mouse said,

17:19.237 --> 17:22.446
'I don't think you're a
Fraidy Cat or a Scaredy Cat.

17:22.449 --> 17:25.617
I think you're a brave
cat, and if you try it,

17:25.618 --> 17:28.345
I think you'll like your new bed'."

17:29.340 --> 17:30.464
So what happened?

17:30.466 --> 17:31.765
Did-did he like the new bed?

17:31.767 --> 17:34.009
The book isn't about
whether he liked it, Kyle.

17:34.011 --> 17:36.478
The book is about whether he'd try it.

17:37.606 --> 17:39.440
Even though he was scared.

17:39.442 --> 17:41.108
Exactly.

17:41.110 --> 17:44.094
You know what? (EXHALES)

17:44.096 --> 17:48.023
I think that Brooksdale
was a-a good choice for me.

17:48.025 --> 17:50.617
And that's what <i> this</i> cat sees.

17:50.619 --> 17:52.361
Thanks, Joe.

17:52.363 --> 17:54.029
(ENGLISH ACCENT): Professor Puddle,

17:54.031 --> 17:56.206
at your service.

18:00.278 --> 18:02.153
Well, that's the last of the bunch.

18:02.155 --> 18:05.132
Back to Bud's Buds... I love it.

18:05.134 --> 18:07.092
It's not illegal, and
I have every right!

18:08.637 --> 18:10.829
I believe I said, "I love it".

18:10.831 --> 18:12.789
And I don't say that
about many things...

18:12.791 --> 18:13.974
my wife, the Broncos,

18:13.976 --> 18:17.052
and any song with a drum solo in it.

18:17.054 --> 18:20.722
Good, because the pot shop
is the perfect location.

18:20.724 --> 18:22.666
According to my research,

18:22.668 --> 18:26.317
the stoners who get high
after work will be getting good

18:26.319 --> 18:28.489
and hungry right about...

18:31.258 --> 18:32.358
... now.

18:33.829 --> 18:35.626
Listen to you, thinking stoners wait

18:35.628 --> 18:37.814
till after work to get loaded.

18:37.816 --> 18:39.574
You ever notice at the coffee shop,

18:39.576 --> 18:41.076
they can never figure out your name?

18:41.078 --> 18:43.587
The Barista, "Is that Mike or Ike?"

18:44.673 --> 18:46.544
Right, like you say, my job is

18:46.546 --> 18:48.158
to keep the wheels of commerce turning.

18:48.160 --> 18:50.177
What I've learned is, if
you're going to make it

18:50.179 --> 18:53.639
in the free marketplace, profit
is the only thing that matters.

18:55.528 --> 18:57.559
It's not my personal
business philosophy,

18:57.561 --> 18:59.261
but it's one way to go.

18:59.263 --> 19:02.022
The road taken, for example,
by the tobacco industry.

19:02.024 --> 19:04.564
What? I'm not like tobacco.

19:04.566 --> 19:06.411
My muffins don't kill people.

19:06.413 --> 19:09.079
No, but selling your
muffins at the pot shop

19:09.081 --> 19:11.347
does come with a risk,
and that risk in the shape

19:11.349 --> 19:13.683
of beautiful hair and nice teeth.

19:13.685 --> 19:15.560
I've thought about this.

19:15.562 --> 19:18.247
And I think the chance of
this hurting Vanessa's campaign

19:18.249 --> 19:21.450
is... slim.

19:21.452 --> 19:24.383
A slim chance is still a
chance, though, isn't it?

19:24.385 --> 19:27.739
I wonder if Blockbuster Video
thought it was a slim chance

19:27.741 --> 19:30.398
that people would be beaming movies

19:30.400 --> 19:33.411
to their watch with magic.

19:33.413 --> 19:35.722
But I want to win!

19:35.724 --> 19:37.540
Well, so does Vanessa.

19:37.542 --> 19:39.134
I'm running a business, Mr. Baxter.

19:39.136 --> 19:40.394
That's not really my problem.

19:40.396 --> 19:42.896
No, that's not your problem.

19:42.898 --> 19:44.565
But I do love Vanessa.

19:44.567 --> 19:46.933
That's your problem, yeah.

19:46.935 --> 19:48.259
Oh, uh...

19:48.261 --> 19:50.551
Come over here a minute and sit down.

19:50.553 --> 19:52.668
This is a very important lesson

19:52.670 --> 19:55.317
about capitalism.

19:55.319 --> 19:57.911
Commerce versus conscience.

19:57.913 --> 20:01.731
Mr. Baxter, please just tell
me not to sell at the pot shop.

20:01.733 --> 20:04.918
Not gonna do it... that
would be regulating you.

20:08.470 --> 20:10.901
(GROANS) Fine!

20:10.903 --> 20:12.475
I won't sell my stupid baked goods

20:12.477 --> 20:13.952
outside the stupid pot
shop, and I won't go

20:13.954 --> 20:15.387
to the stupid Grand Canyon!

20:19.009 --> 20:21.935
Girl says stupid three times, smart.

20:28.946 --> 20:30.326
You know what?

20:30.328 --> 20:31.851
I say you're lying.

20:31.853 --> 20:34.693
I wrote it!

20:34.695 --> 20:37.701
This was my young daughter
Eve's favorite book

20:37.703 --> 20:39.571
when she was growing up.

20:39.573 --> 20:42.615
You're telling me you sat
and wrote this entire book?

20:42.617 --> 20:46.484
Mostly sat, some of it
I wrote on the treadmill.

20:46.486 --> 20:49.445
Let's just check this
out on the Internet.

20:49.447 --> 20:51.632
- Yeah.
- Okay.

20:51.634 --> 20:54.593
Okay, let's see, let's find
<i>What the Cat Sees.</i>

20:55.724 --> 20:57.104
Well, lookie there.

20:57.106 --> 20:58.771
Picture of you.

20:58.773 --> 21:00.462
Told you.

21:00.464 --> 21:01.546
Can I have this?

21:02.478 --> 21:04.520
$12.95.

21:05.814 --> 21:07.297
Well, will you sign it?

21:07.299 --> 21:09.191
Sure.

21:11.136 --> 21:12.635
To Eve?

21:12.637 --> 21:14.846
(STAMMERS) Just put Mike.

21:14.848 --> 21:16.806
Mike...

21:16.808 --> 21:19.350
My, my best friend Mike.

21:19.352 --> 21:22.086
"My best friend..."

21:22.088 --> 21:23.479
All right.

21:23.481 --> 21:25.165
- Hey, appreciate it, man.
- There you go.

21:25.167 --> 21:26.533
That's great.

21:26.535 --> 21:27.678
I really appreciate it, thanks.

21:27.680 --> 21:29.169
Hey, hey! Where's my money?

21:29.171 --> 21:30.320
Just consider me the government.

21:30.322 --> 21:31.797
Add it to the debt.

21:33.033 --> 21:34.341
Joke's on him.

21:34.343 --> 21:35.759
Wait till he reads what I wrote.

21:38.847 --> 21:40.347
