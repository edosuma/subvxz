We don't wanna see you dirty
on this camera, Tahir, you understand?

if you get robbed.

No. No camera in the crapper.

her a couple days earlier.

ls it your testimony
that you felt no curiosity. . .

34:05.453 --> 34:08.842
. . .as to why she was approached?
Did you think it was at random?

34:09.053 --> 34:11.886

was in their pocket. . .

to suspect her of any criminal activity.

work together in the squad room.
