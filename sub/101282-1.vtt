WEBVTT

00:44.728 --> 00:46.329
What up, kids? It's Cole.

00:46.363 --> 00:48.465
This is ERL.

00:48.498 --> 00:50.433
I just got out of the bathroom.

00:50.467 --> 00:52.069
And I am so high.

00:52.103 --> 00:54.671
30,000-feet-in-the-air high!
Sorry.

00:54.704 --> 00:58.910
Anyway, this month marks ten
years of having doing this.

00:58.943 --> 01:01.611
Ten! What?!

01:01.645 --> 01:05.749
You better buckle those safety belts because
ten years of filming is a ton of footage.

01:08.485 --> 01:10.955
<i>And before we left on this
trip, I went through all of it.</i>

01:10.988 --> 01:12.355
<i>Or most of it.</i>

01:12.389 --> 01:13.490
<i>Or some of it.</i>

01:13.523 --> 01:15.358
<i>There's just so much!</i>

01:15.392 --> 01:17.494
Did you see that?

01:17.527 --> 01:19.663
<i>It's hard to believe how many
adventures we've been on together.</i>

01:23.067 --> 01:25.402
<i>Before any of that stuff,
my parents were filming me.</i>

01:25.435 --> 01:27.004
Cole, Cole, Cole.
Watch out! Hold on. Hold on, buddy.

01:27.038 --> 01:29.372
<i>All the time.</i>

01:29.406 --> 01:31.741
- <i>Hey, look. It's tiny me.</i>
- Happy birthday, Cole.

01:31.776 --> 01:35.046
<i>Once I got my hands on a
camera, I was filming everything.</i>

01:36.881 --> 01:38.816
- Come on, Cole, you got it!
- Oh!

01:38.850 --> 01:40.684
- <i>Ouch.</i>
- Thomas, keep your eyes on the road.

01:40.717 --> 01:43.486
<i>And when I got older,
I started this channel</i>

01:43.520 --> 01:46.157
<i>and began sharing my videos
with you and it blew up!</i>

01:46.190 --> 01:49.392
<i>Now I get to do this
for a living!</i>

01:49.426 --> 01:52.163
<i>Which is nuts!</i>

01:52.196 --> 01:54.397
<i>I traveled all over the world,</i>

01:54.431 --> 01:57.068
<i>looking for the wildest
experiences to entertain you guys.</i>

01:57.101 --> 02:00.104
A 100,000... 250...
Half a million followers.

02:00.805 --> 02:04.441
I'm in Brooklyn! Birmingham, Alabama.
I'm in Detroit.

02:04.474 --> 02:05.642
ERL is in Nepal.

02:07.078 --> 02:09.479
<i>You watched, commented...</i>

02:10.948 --> 02:12.183
<i>and told me
what to do next.</i>

02:12.216 --> 02:14.051
What up, kids, it's Cole.

02:14.085 --> 02:16.553
I challenge all of you to find
something that scares me.

02:16.586 --> 02:18.122
I dare you! Come on!

02:20.825 --> 02:21.792
<i>And I listened!</i>

02:21.826 --> 02:23.127
Hey. Hi.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.462
OK, go, go. Shit.

02:25.495 --> 02:27.664
- Sir, you can't film here.
- I'm not, it's not on.

02:27.697 --> 02:29.599
I'm in a coffin
being buried alive.

02:29.633 --> 02:31.534
OK, it's not so bad.

02:34.571 --> 02:35.705
Hello? Oh, shit.

02:35.739 --> 02:37.440
<i>Looking at all this crazy shit</i>

02:37.474 --> 02:39.442
<i>we've done together,
and this escape from real life,</i>

02:39.476 --> 02:41.645
<i>none of this would've been
possible</i>

02:41.678 --> 02:43.580
- <i>if it wasn't for this vlog and for all of you.</i>
- Shi...

02:43.613 --> 02:44.815
<i>So thank you.</i>

02:44.849 --> 02:45.950
Woo!

02:46.350 --> 02:47.818
<i>All right, the nostalgia trip
is over.</i>

02:47.852 --> 02:49.552
<i>So, if you remember back
in August,</i>

02:49.586 --> 02:52.089
we asked you to vote
on where we should go

02:52.123 --> 02:54.125
to celebrate this amazing
occasion.

02:54.158 --> 02:56.426
Over a million of you
weighed in and...

02:57.261 --> 02:58.829
Moscow.

02:58.863 --> 03:00.798
My friends pulled all the
stops

03:00.831 --> 03:02.532
and they hooked us up
with first-class tickets!

03:02.565 --> 03:04.567
That's right!

03:04.601 --> 03:06.670
As usual, I'm taking you somewhere
you've probably never been

03:06.703 --> 03:08.505
to show you something
you've never seen.

03:08.538 --> 03:10.107
I know where we're going

03:10.141 --> 03:12.642
but I have no idea
what we're doing

03:12.676 --> 03:14.511
because they won't tell me!

03:14.544 --> 03:15.780
- Dash!
- Evening!

03:15.813 --> 03:17.647
- Samantha!
- Yo. Yeah.

03:17.681 --> 03:19.716
Actually, Samantha wasn't
supposed to be here because

03:19.749 --> 03:21.584
she's usually training
for the X Games,

03:21.618 --> 03:23.586
But for the first time in
forever, she didn't qualify.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.056
Ooh! Oh!

03:25.089 --> 03:27.091
- Ouch!
- Fuck you, OK?

03:27.124 --> 03:28.591
Hey, hey, hey. Children are watching.

03:28.625 --> 03:31.628
- And... Erin is here!
- Hi, guys!

03:31.661 --> 03:33.596
Yeah, it's her first time
out of the states.

03:33.630 --> 03:35.665
- Are you serious?
- Mm-hmm.

03:35.699 --> 03:37.101
Besides Mexico.

03:37.134 --> 03:38.769
Which does not count.

03:38.803 --> 03:41.738
But you can plan on seeing
a lot more of her!

03:41.772 --> 03:42.773
Really?

03:42.807 --> 03:43.808
Yes, they will.

03:43.841 --> 03:45.276
So, we're almost there

03:45.309 --> 03:46.743
and then you kinda have to
tell me, OK?

03:46.777 --> 03:47.878
I think I've waited
long enough.

03:47.912 --> 03:49.280
OK. Not a chance.

03:49.313 --> 03:51.182
OK, fine.

03:51.215 --> 03:52.183
You know what?
That's all for now.

03:52.216 --> 03:53.683
No, wait, wait, wait!

03:53.717 --> 03:54.752
- I'm turning this off.
- Wait, wait.

03:54.785 --> 03:55.820
Get ready.

03:57.721 --> 03:59.190
Oh, my God!

03:59.223 --> 04:01.192
This is my best friend
in the world, Thomas!

04:01.225 --> 04:04.195
Oh, yeah! First class.
I see you, big dog. OK!

04:04.228 --> 04:06.864
Dude, wait, where were you
this whole flight?

04:06.897 --> 04:08.631
Coach. I wanted it
to be a surprise.

04:08.665 --> 04:10.034
Thank you so much.
You guys are the best.

04:10.067 --> 04:11.668
Thanks, bro.
Anything for you.

04:11.701 --> 04:13.037
- Here, let me get this.
- OK.

04:13.070 --> 04:14.872
- All right.
- Happy ten!

04:14.905 --> 04:16.173
- Happy ten years, buddy.
- Love you, man!

04:16.207 --> 04:17.108
You guys are
the best friends ever.

04:17.141 --> 04:18.242
Cheers!

04:31.688 --> 04:33.290
Oh, finally.
He's finished.

04:33.324 --> 04:34.859
Oh, look who's done.

04:37.895 --> 04:40.331
All right.
What the hell we doing?

04:40.364 --> 04:42.599
'Cause, 'cause, like,
come on.

04:42.632 --> 04:44.601
I've been waiting, so...

04:44.634 --> 04:46.303
you... you, like, tell me,
like, for real.

04:46.337 --> 04:47.338
You gonna tell me, or...?

04:47.371 --> 04:48.939
All right. So...

04:48.973 --> 04:52.176
I have a buddy in Moscow
named Alexei.

04:52.209 --> 04:54.311
This guy is next-level loaded.

04:54.345 --> 04:55.946
And when I told him you're
coming,

04:55.980 --> 04:57.747
he watches ERL. Loves you, bro.

04:57.782 --> 04:59.582
He wants to take us everywhere.

04:59.616 --> 05:01.852
I'm talking the best clubs,
the best restaurants,

05:01.886 --> 05:05.756
And when I mean "the best," this
guy's so rich, that everything he does

05:05.790 --> 05:07.925
is legitimately the best.

05:07.958 --> 05:09.960
OK, OK.
Clubs and restaurants,

05:09.994 --> 05:13.964
but like what are we
actually doing there?

05:13.998 --> 05:16.033
- Are you done?
- Yes, go ahead. Sorry.

05:16.067 --> 05:20.337
We are taking you to an escape
room experience in Moscow.

05:21.638 --> 05:23.673
Seriously?

05:26.877 --> 05:27.845
You're serious?

05:27.878 --> 05:29.746
That's what it is? Yeah?

05:29.780 --> 05:31.782
We're flying all the way to
Russia to go do an escape room?

05:31.816 --> 05:35.352
- I've been to escape rooms, man. Come on.
- No, no. Yeah.

05:35.386 --> 05:37.321
Dude, I can't vlog an escape room.
What are you, nuts?

05:37.354 --> 05:39.390
I get it, you been to an escape
room but not one like this, bro.

05:39.423 --> 05:41.258
This one you have to be
personally invited to.

05:41.292 --> 05:43.626
It's custom-made.
It's scary as hell.

05:43.660 --> 05:46.864
And that means it's
perfect for you.

05:46.897 --> 05:49.800
OK. No one else
could do this.

05:49.834 --> 05:51.402
They built it for us.

05:51.435 --> 05:52.702
Swear to God.

05:57.441 --> 05:58.843
OK.

05:58.876 --> 06:00.845
OK! OK. OK.

06:02.780 --> 06:04.348
All right,
say that one more time.

06:04.381 --> 06:06.683
You're taking me to
an escape room?

06:06.716 --> 06:08.685
- We're...
- For those of you who don't know what an escape room is,

06:08.718 --> 06:11.288
it's a game where they lock
you and your friends in a room

06:11.322 --> 06:13.390
and you have to solve puzzles
to try and get out.

06:13.424 --> 06:15.159
Why does that need to be explained?

06:15.192 --> 06:17.394
Oh, and they don't have
the same rules we do, so...

06:17.428 --> 06:21.232
Exactly! Thank you.
Which means, Cole, dear friend of mine,

06:21.265 --> 06:22.299
you can't be a pussy!

06:22.333 --> 06:23.868
Oh, dude! Come on, man!

06:23.901 --> 06:25.870
You know that I am up
for anything!

06:25.903 --> 06:28.405
Oh! Give me that!
You guys heard him, he said anything!

06:28.439 --> 06:30.074
Give it! All right.

06:30.107 --> 06:31.708
They're letting us tie into
their cameras,

06:31.741 --> 06:33.444
which means, you guys are
gonna be able to see it.

06:33.477 --> 06:35.913
OK. How do you know
this Alexei guy?

06:35.946 --> 06:37.848
His dad is some politics
or some shit,

06:37.882 --> 06:39.316
I don't even know.
But the last time I met him,

06:39.350 --> 06:41.252
he was throwing around
money like an idiot, bro.

06:41.285 --> 06:43.020
It was insane.

06:43.053 --> 06:45.289
We ended up on a yacht
for, like, a fuckin' week.

06:45.322 --> 06:47.791
Oh, shit.
Delete that last part.

06:47.825 --> 06:48.859
No, dude. This is live.

06:50.394 --> 06:52.029
Samantha's responsible for me.

06:52.062 --> 06:54.465
So there you go.
Mystery revealed.

06:54.498 --> 06:57.301
A Russian escape room.
What could possibly go wrong?

06:57.334 --> 06:59.403
This goin' be lit!
Peace out, kids!

07:03.007 --> 07:04.875
"This 'gun be lit.
Peace out, kids."

07:06.777 --> 07:09.079
Oh, yeah, you gonna have
to delete that. Come on, bro.

07:09.113 --> 07:10.347
No, no, no.

07:12.049 --> 07:14.151
For real, though.
How's that going over there?

07:16.820 --> 07:18.721
Mm-hmm. She's cool.

07:19.990 --> 07:22.126
- "She's cool"?
- Yeah, dude.

07:22.159 --> 07:24.495
I see it all up in your face.
You really care about her, don't you?

07:24.528 --> 07:27.031
Yeah, man. Like, you can tell?
Like, right now?

07:27.064 --> 07:30.100
You can't hide that.
White people do that.

07:33.103 --> 07:35.873
Ah, man. Yeah, no. She's...

07:35.906 --> 07:39.910
She's the first girl that I've
been with who really sees me.

07:39.944 --> 07:41.412
You know? She's great.

07:41.445 --> 07:43.047
That's dope.
I'm happy for you.

07:45.416 --> 07:46.951
Shit.

07:46.984 --> 07:49.453
Whoa! No, no, no, sir. Oh!

07:49.853 --> 07:51.956
You OK, babe?

08:05.402 --> 08:08.372
Hey, yo!
We are in Russia, baby!

08:08.405 --> 08:10.407
And I have a quick question
for my fellow friends.

08:10.441 --> 08:11.508
Have you ever wondered
what's back there?

08:11.542 --> 08:13.410
No, not once ever. No.

08:13.444 --> 08:15.346
So, we all agree I should
go back there?

08:15.379 --> 08:16.880
- No.
- No, couldn't care less.

08:16.914 --> 08:18.415
OK, I'll be right back.

08:18.449 --> 08:21.151
- He plays too much.
- Yo.

08:25.589 --> 08:27.958
Yo, Dash!

08:30.594 --> 08:33.163
Where'd he go?

08:33.197 --> 08:35.432
What is he doing?

08:35.466 --> 08:37.501
Dash, what are you doing?

08:39.036 --> 08:42.873
Oh, no. Oh, no. We lost Dash.

08:44.475 --> 08:45.576
OK. Cole? Cole?

08:45.609 --> 08:47.544
Whoa, hey. Whoa, whoa!

08:47.578 --> 08:49.380
Whoa, whoa, w-wait, wait.

08:49.413 --> 08:50.881
I swear to God,
I wasn't gonna... Cole!

08:50.914 --> 08:52.850
W-wait, wait. Wait one second.

08:52.883 --> 08:54.084
Wh-what happened?

08:55.419 --> 08:56.487
Uh, sir.

08:58.455 --> 09:00.424
I... I... uh...

09:00.457 --> 09:03.060
I'm sorry, my friend's
an idiot. One... one second.

09:04.862 --> 09:05.863
I...

09:07.231 --> 09:09.033
Hey, hey. Whoa.

09:17.241 --> 09:21.478
Oh.
OK.

09:29.953 --> 09:31.021
Mm-hmm.

09:36.527 --> 09:38.495
Thank you.

09:38.529 --> 09:40.230
What's up, bud?

09:40.264 --> 09:43.300
Uh, I was throwing money
around like, uh, like an idiot?

09:46.003 --> 09:50.441
Uh, no, no.
Like, um, no, no, um...

09:50.474 --> 09:54.111
Come on!
I'm fucking with you!

09:54.144 --> 09:55.446
But I do, huh?

09:55.479 --> 09:58.082
You're a legend, bro.
This is Cole.

09:58.115 --> 10:00.184
- Cole.
- Alexei. Welcome to Moscow.

10:00.217 --> 10:01.218
Thank you.

10:01.251 --> 10:02.319
Where's the rest?

10:04.555 --> 10:06.657
It's great to finally meet you,
Cole, huh?

10:06.690 --> 10:09.993
And see this motherfucker again.

10:10.027 --> 10:12.196
- How've you been, bro?
- Very good, very good.

10:12.229 --> 10:13.931
Whoa.

10:21.505 --> 10:23.640
Everyone, this is Victoria.

10:23.674 --> 10:24.675
Hello, everyone.

10:24.708 --> 10:26.076
- Hi.
- Hey.

10:26.110 --> 10:29.046
And this is Sergei.
Vitali.

10:29.079 --> 10:30.681
Personal driver and security.

10:30.714 --> 10:32.950
Now, they go everywhere
that I go.

10:32.983 --> 10:35.519
- OK? It's very cool.
- Now...

10:36.687 --> 10:38.055
Everybody, we go.

10:59.676 --> 11:03.113
Oh, yeah. That's it, Cole,
you bringin' me on all those trips.

11:03.147 --> 11:05.949
This place is fucking
amazing, huh? Come on.

11:05.983 --> 11:07.117
Who wants a drink?

11:09.353 --> 11:11.288
Only the best
for you guys.

11:11.321 --> 11:14.091
Oh, what do
we have here?

11:14.124 --> 11:16.293
- Dash...
- France all over again.

11:16.326 --> 11:18.061
- Welcome.
- Pleasure.

11:18.095 --> 11:20.297
Ooh, wow.

11:21.231 --> 11:24.234
Cole.

11:24.268 --> 11:29.573
OK. Everyone.
Welcome to Russia. Huh?

11:30.240 --> 11:31.975
To Russia!

11:44.354 --> 11:45.422
What is this?

11:48.125 --> 11:49.660
Here we go.

11:49.693 --> 11:51.228
Yeah,
this about to be dope!

11:51.261 --> 11:52.663
Oh, this doesn't
look sketchy at all.

11:54.364 --> 11:56.233
Yo, Dash,
this your scene, right?

11:56.266 --> 11:59.670
OK. OK.

11:59.703 --> 12:02.239
Erin, look.
It's a real Russian club.

12:02.272 --> 12:03.373
Obviously.

12:07.110 --> 12:12.216
Oh! Whoa! Look at this!
So much content! Whoa!

12:12.249 --> 12:15.753
Yo, Cole, you see that?

12:15.787 --> 12:19.623
Sam. How about this? Divide and
conquer. Whoever gets the hottest girl wins.

12:19.656 --> 12:21.358
- Yes!
- Oh, shit. We get our own table?

12:21.391 --> 12:25.295
H-hey, fire!
Dude, this is sick!

12:25.329 --> 12:27.197
All right, so which one?

12:27.231 --> 12:29.132
- Her. The brunette.
- That's easy.

12:29.166 --> 12:31.201
- Easy for what?
- I could easily do that.

12:31.235 --> 12:33.270
So you're telling me,
you could do that?

12:33.303 --> 12:35.272
Hell, not a chance
in the world.

12:37.241 --> 12:39.743
You said it like
I'm a joke. Oh, my God.

12:44.114 --> 12:47.752
We know each other very well.

12:49.386 --> 12:52.089
This is Mina.
She's beautiful, isn't she?

12:52.122 --> 12:53.423
Yeah!

12:53.457 --> 12:54.691
What?

13:00.197 --> 13:02.099
Oh, shit.
She's coming over.

13:04.836 --> 13:07.404
How you doin? Oh, a shot.
We're gonna drink... Oh!

13:11.742 --> 13:12.844
Oh, this is happening.

13:12.877 --> 13:14.278
Samantha.

13:14.311 --> 13:15.847
All right, yup. I'm ready.

13:15.880 --> 13:17.114
Let's dance.

13:46.778 --> 13:48.412
Moscow! Whoo!

13:53.250 --> 13:55.185
Alexei, you drink like this
every night?

13:55.218 --> 13:58.188
That's right! Hey...

13:58.221 --> 14:00.424
You party all the time, too.
Come on!

14:00.457 --> 14:02.626
No, no. That's just
for the camera, man.

14:02.659 --> 14:04.328
I remember the first time
we got drunk. You remember that?

14:04.361 --> 14:05.763
- I do remember that.
- Oh, shit!

14:05.797 --> 14:07.464
- Oh!
- Sorry.

14:09.399 --> 14:11.301
OK, OK, OK.

14:11.335 --> 14:16.440
ERL is in the club!

14:16.473 --> 14:19.911
Hey, guys!

14:19.944 --> 14:22.880
So we came halfway
around the world.

14:22.914 --> 14:24.782
What do you have
planned for us?

14:24.816 --> 14:28.251
- You have never seen anything like it, OK?
- OK.

14:28.285 --> 14:33.457
- Every experience is tailored to the player...
- Hi, guys.

14:33.490 --> 14:34.792
Hi.

14:34.826 --> 14:36.627
Uh, we watch you all the time.

14:36.660 --> 14:39.429
Oh, you do? Oh, well,
actually, we're live right now.

14:39.463 --> 14:41.398
Oh!

14:41.431 --> 14:43.233
All right, actually, hold on.

14:43.266 --> 14:45.602
It's... it's better,
better by bar.

14:46.838 --> 14:49.439
Uh, I'm Alina. This is my
sister, Alisa.

14:50.842 --> 14:52.309
It's nice to meet you.

14:53.276 --> 14:54.444
Hey, uh, Cole?

14:54.478 --> 14:56.313
Hold on one second, man.

14:56.346 --> 14:57.648
They watch my vlogs.

14:57.681 --> 14:59.516
All right. Where are
you girls from?

14:59.549 --> 15:01.385
- St. Petersburg!
- St. Petersburg!

15:01.418 --> 15:02.954
- I've never been there before.
- You should come...

15:02.987 --> 15:04.688
Hey, uh, Cole.

15:04.721 --> 15:06.891
Well, maybe we should. Hey,
Thomas, how far away

15:06.924 --> 15:08.225
is St. Petersburg from here?

15:08.258 --> 15:09.259
Cole, look!

15:09.292 --> 15:10.427
Cole!

15:13.798 --> 15:15.933
Hey, get your fucking hands
off her!

15:19.003 --> 15:20.537
Oh, shit! Cole, Cole, stop!

15:20.570 --> 15:21.973
You don't know who these
guys are.

15:22.006 --> 15:23.975
I don't give a fuck who they
are... let go!

15:37.554 --> 15:38.588
Tell him stop!

16:05.449 --> 16:06.683
Motherfucker.

16:10.021 --> 16:12.622
You and your friends
are fucked!

16:15.325 --> 16:16.526
I'm watching you, you bitch.

16:16.560 --> 16:18.930
- Hey, you OK?
- Yeah.

16:18.963 --> 16:20.497
Who the fuck were those guys?

16:22.666 --> 16:23.901
Hey, you OK?

16:23.935 --> 16:27.038
- Yeah. Let's just go.
- OK.

16:27.071 --> 16:28.371
Sorry about that.

16:28.405 --> 16:29.573
Let's get the fuck out of here.

16:29.606 --> 16:31.042
Let's go. Come on.

16:31.075 --> 16:32.709
Let's get the fuck
out of here. Now. Go.

16:32.743 --> 16:35.913
- What was that? What the fuck?
- Let it go.

16:35.947 --> 16:38.515
Come on. Ooh!

16:41.886 --> 16:44.021
I apologize for not
coming sooner.

16:44.055 --> 16:47.657
I wouldn't know what would've
happened if you didn't get there.

16:47.691 --> 16:49.426
I mean, like, who were those
fuckin' guys?

16:49.459 --> 16:51.561
I feel like they knew Alexei
or something.

16:51.595 --> 16:54.397
Those clubs are.

16:54.431 --> 16:56.533
How you say? A bad type.

16:56.566 --> 16:58.936
Mr. Koslov should know better.

16:58.970 --> 17:01.671
Well, thank you.

17:01.705 --> 17:03.507
For, you know... Thanks.

17:03.540 --> 17:06.878
Eh,

17:06.911 --> 17:09.613
I wonder if Alexei
got any of that on camera.

17:14.986 --> 17:16.353
Sorry.

17:19.123 --> 17:22.894
I'm just glad that we're all...

17:22.927 --> 17:24.628
safe, you know?

18:08.005 --> 18:10.007
Cole.

18:10.041 --> 18:13.743
<i>You've gotten used to all
of these people following you</i>

18:13.778 --> 18:17.347
<i>and watching everything you do.
And it's exciting.</i>

18:18.648 --> 18:22.419
<i>But I finally get to be
a part of it with you.</i>

18:22.452 --> 18:25.455
<i>I'm not sure what these trips
are normally like.</i>

18:25.488 --> 18:28.625
<i>But it looked like
we were in real danger.</i>

18:28.658 --> 18:30.694
<i>And you were too busy
with your fans to notice.</i>

18:32.495 --> 18:34.832
<i>That guy pulled a gun on us.</i>

18:34.866 --> 18:38.635
<i>And afterwards, I couldn't tell if
you were more concerned about me</i>

18:38.668 --> 18:41.973
or how many people
were watching.

18:42.006 --> 18:45.642
<i>I know there are
two sides to you.</i>

18:45.675 --> 18:48.779
<i>The public Cole.
And the real Cole.</i>

18:48.813 --> 18:50.647
<i>My Cole.</i>

18:50.680 --> 18:53.450
<i>They both have their place,
but...</i>

18:55.485 --> 18:57.487
<i>I always thought you knew
the difference.</i>

19:12.569 --> 19:15.639
- Don't forget. At Dash.
- OK.

19:15.672 --> 19:18.175
- Dash! Don't forget to call me back. Cool.
- Mm-hmm.

19:20.477 --> 19:22.813
Good morning.

19:22.847 --> 19:24.681
- Morning!
- Good morning.

19:30.087 --> 19:32.589
Morning, guys.

19:32.622 --> 19:34.025
Morning.

19:34.058 --> 19:35.725
How was last night?

19:35.760 --> 19:38.095
Now you know
your boy can't drink.

19:38.129 --> 19:39.629
He's still in
my room, asleep.

19:39.663 --> 19:41.165
Oh, he ended up
in your room?

19:41.198 --> 19:43.100
I kicked him out of
my place last night.

19:43.134 --> 19:45.535
You have no shame at all.

19:45.568 --> 19:47.138
No, no. Did you see her?

19:47.171 --> 19:49.472
Exactly. You would've
done the same thing.

19:51.042 --> 19:52.810
Oh, I think Alexei's sending
a car for us at two.

19:52.843 --> 19:54.845
Yeah.

19:54.879 --> 19:57.514
Oh, do you guys mind if
I steal him for the day?

19:57.547 --> 20:00.117
- What?! No, I thought we were gonna go sight-seeing.
- Absolutely.

20:00.151 --> 20:03.854
Thomas is not getting up no time soon.
We can just do our own thing.

20:03.888 --> 20:06.257
Fine, whatever.
Who needs you guys?

20:06.290 --> 20:09.126
We have a fireplace.
We have a spa.

20:09.160 --> 20:10.828
We have room service.
That's all paid for, yeah?

20:12.263 --> 20:13.798
Yeah, we don't need
you guys.

20:18.302 --> 20:19.736
It's two o'clock.

20:21.638 --> 20:24.507
It's the only car here.

20:24.541 --> 20:25.742
I guess this ours?

20:25.776 --> 20:26.944
Obviously.

20:34.251 --> 20:35.585
Hi. Are you here for Cole...?

20:35.618 --> 20:37.221
Cole. Turner.

20:39.123 --> 20:40.925
Please, step inside.

20:42.326 --> 20:43.593
Um...

20:44.661 --> 20:46.629
Please, step inside.

20:46.663 --> 20:48.165
Thank you.

20:59.276 --> 21:00.610
That's so pretty.

21:04.681 --> 21:07.584
- Should we get out and walk? The Red Square's right up here.
- Oh yeah.

21:07.617 --> 21:10.821
Mr. Alexei told me to stay
with you. I wouldn't want to...

21:10.855 --> 21:12.555
Yeah, but that's OK.
Stop right up here.

21:12.589 --> 21:13.891
Yeah, yeah, stop right up here.

21:13.924 --> 21:16.827
It's perfect. We'll meet
you back here later.

21:18.963 --> 21:20.730
Uh, can you unlock the door,
please?

21:23.367 --> 21:27.604
Can I just take you to the place I
was told to take you? And then...

21:27.637 --> 21:31.275
She... she wants to see Red
Square, and we're kinda tourists.

21:31.308 --> 21:33.010
So we'll meet back here later.

21:36.347 --> 21:38.949
OK. OK, I'll pick you up
on the far side.

21:38.983 --> 21:40.351
Perfect.

21:40.384 --> 21:41.852
Baby, we haven't exchanged
currency yet.

21:41.886 --> 21:42.887
Uh, do you know where we
can get...?

21:42.920 --> 21:43.988
You don't have any rubles?

21:47.724 --> 21:50.795
How about 100 dollars?
No worries.

21:52.196 --> 21:54.697
Most places will not
take credit.

21:54.731 --> 21:55.900
Thanks, bro.

21:57.368 --> 21:58.903
I need to have you by eight!
You...

22:33.703 --> 22:37.208
So it's 6:15 here,
that means at home it's...

22:37.241 --> 22:39.844
8:15 AM.

22:39.877 --> 22:42.346
I always keep the watch
on LA time. Ha!

22:42.379 --> 22:43.881
You're so weird.

22:45.916 --> 22:47.952
I thought I'd have
terrible jet lag and...

22:47.985 --> 22:50.955
Mm. Everything last night.

22:50.988 --> 22:52.689
Hm.

22:52.722 --> 22:54.258
Oh, that bed was so comfy.
I slept like a rock.

22:54.291 --> 22:55.759
Me, too.

22:55.793 --> 22:59.029
I'm glad I get you almost
to myself today.

23:00.931 --> 23:04.034
So am I. This was good.
I'm glad we stumbled in here.

23:04.068 --> 23:05.436
Imagine that.

23:05.469 --> 23:06.937
Oh, my God.

23:06.971 --> 23:08.906
Not having to ask anyone.

23:08.939 --> 23:10.975
- I mean, I'm actually really proud of you.
- Thank you.

23:11.008 --> 23:13.377
- How will anyone even know that we were here?
- I don't know.

23:13.410 --> 23:14.778
I mean, that we had so much fun?

23:14.812 --> 23:15.946
And it was so beautiful.

23:15.980 --> 23:17.948
OK. OK.

23:21.018 --> 23:22.086
Oh.

23:24.321 --> 23:26.790
Thank you.

23:30.828 --> 23:33.397
Hey, uh, how much, uh...

23:34.865 --> 23:35.933
What's wrong?

23:37.101 --> 23:38.802
Well, it's not US dollars.

23:43.407 --> 23:44.942
Cole?

23:47.011 --> 23:48.312
Do you have cash?

23:48.345 --> 23:51.081
Uh,.
Do I have enough cash?

23:52.749 --> 23:53.951
OK.

23:53.984 --> 23:55.152
Oops.

24:01.525 --> 24:02.960
Looks like it.

24:02.993 --> 24:04.395
You're really cool.

24:04.428 --> 24:05.429
Thanks.

24:05.462 --> 24:06.830
You get that a lot?

24:06.864 --> 24:08.199
I do.

24:08.232 --> 24:10.100
Yeah, you clearly like
the lifestyle. I get it.

24:10.134 --> 24:11.802
I'm slowly picking up on that.

24:11.835 --> 24:14.305
I'm Russian-rich.

24:14.338 --> 24:16.840
Um, Mr. Koslov
has taken care of your meal

24:16.874 --> 24:19.109
and the driver
is waiting outside.

24:19.143 --> 24:21.011
Wait, Alexei?

24:23.347 --> 24:24.381
OK.

24:24.415 --> 24:25.482
Oh!

24:29.386 --> 24:30.387
This is yours.

24:30.421 --> 24:31.455
Huh?

24:37.928 --> 24:38.996
What is this?

24:39.463 --> 24:40.730
Mm.

24:43.901 --> 24:46.470
Hey. How did Alexei
even know where we are?

24:46.503 --> 24:48.005
I don't know.

24:48.038 --> 24:49.873
Is that cool or creepy?

24:49.907 --> 24:52.042
Uh, yeah,

24:52.076 --> 24:53.911
A little, yeah.

24:53.944 --> 24:55.446
Excited for tonight?

24:55.479 --> 24:57.348
You know me,
I'm gonna hype anything.

24:57.381 --> 25:00.017
But I hope that
it is big enough.

25:00.050 --> 25:01.518
No, I wouldn't worry
about that.

25:01.552 --> 25:03.153
Like, just wait.

25:03.187 --> 25:04.221
Oh, my...

25:07.124 --> 25:08.092
Cole.

25:08.125 --> 25:09.159
Yeah?

25:13.430 --> 25:14.398
What?

25:14.431 --> 25:16.066
This is all for you.

25:16.100 --> 25:18.035
So if tonight gets too intense,
I hope you know...

25:18.068 --> 25:20.104
Too intense?
We're going to an escape room.

25:20.137 --> 25:23.040
Come on. Stop.

25:23.073 --> 25:24.174
All right.

25:24.208 --> 25:25.175
What?

25:25.209 --> 25:26.910
OK.

25:26.944 --> 25:28.379
Do you remember who you're
talking to right now?

25:28.412 --> 25:30.581
Oh, shut up.

25:30.614 --> 25:32.249
Come on, let's go.

25:37.554 --> 25:41.191
Actually, hold on.
Wait, for real.

25:43.861 --> 25:45.529
Hey, kids. It's Cole.

25:45.562 --> 25:48.165
I just wanted to hop on
really fast and thank everybody

25:48.198 --> 25:53.070
so much for their suggestions.
AlisaV34, the Bolshoi was mmm...

25:53.103 --> 25:55.472
Amazing! Yes!

25:55.506 --> 25:58.409
And I don't know why everybody
shit-talks Russia so much,

25:58.442 --> 26:02.012
besides all the guns and
gangsters, actually not that bad.

26:07.985 --> 26:09.219
It's not!

26:09.253 --> 26:10.554
You know.

26:10.587 --> 26:11.588
OK?

26:11.622 --> 26:15.859
So anyway, in three hours,

26:15.893 --> 26:19.096
we will be going live from
this mysterious escape room.

26:19.129 --> 26:23.167
See what happens
9 PM Moscow time.

26:23.200 --> 26:24.635
- Let's go.
- And we out!

26:24.668 --> 26:26.503
- This is stupid.
- OK, OK.

26:44.555 --> 26:46.190
Oh, actually...

26:48.192 --> 26:49.460
Hey, thank you so much.

26:49.493 --> 26:51.595
No, Mr. Cole.
Uh, you keep it.

26:51.628 --> 26:53.997
I... I insist, please.
You keep it. Please.

26:54.031 --> 26:54.998
Oh.

26:55.032 --> 26:56.100
Shit!

27:01.071 --> 27:02.139
You two ready?

27:02.172 --> 27:03.173
What?

27:03.207 --> 27:04.274
Hey.

27:06.577 --> 27:08.112
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

27:08.145 --> 27:09.246
He didn't give you
any trouble, did he?

27:09.279 --> 27:10.914
'Cause I will fucking fire him.

27:10.948 --> 27:12.549
No, no, no. It's no big deal.

27:12.583 --> 27:14.551
- Want to stay here? I should
get changed before we go.

27:14.585 --> 27:15.919
Yeah, yeah, sounds good.

27:15.953 --> 27:17.955
OK, then.

27:19.289 --> 27:20.657
I am so happy for you.

27:20.691 --> 27:22.626
I wish I could go again.

27:22.659 --> 27:24.294
You can't go twice?

27:24.328 --> 27:25.562
No.

27:25.596 --> 27:27.264
This is all he could talk about

27:27.297 --> 27:30.200
for a month after we went.

27:30.234 --> 27:32.569
About how intense it was.

27:32.603 --> 27:34.705
And how it gave him life.

27:34.738 --> 27:37.508
Hey.
OK?

27:37.541 --> 27:40.010
Yeah?

27:55.159 --> 27:57.628
Hey, man.
What'd you get into today?

27:57.661 --> 28:00.230
Oh. Room service.

28:00.264 --> 28:02.599
Fire. I got a massage.

28:02.633 --> 28:04.968
I know you're jealous.
I know.

28:06.303 --> 28:08.005
I'm on vacation, baby.

28:09.306 --> 28:11.708
About to get ready
for tonight.

28:27.391 --> 28:28.725
- Hey.
- Hm.

28:31.662 --> 28:33.397
Oh, this place is fire.

28:36.400 --> 28:38.035
Oh, yup,
this has got me out.

28:45.375 --> 28:46.677
OK, now.

28:46.710 --> 28:51.248
Remember. As real
as everything might seem,

28:52.683 --> 28:53.717
OK?

28:54.718 --> 28:55.986
You're safe.

28:57.321 --> 28:58.355
OK?

29:01.291 --> 29:02.359
That's dramatic.

29:04.428 --> 29:05.395
Let's do it.

29:05.429 --> 29:08.198
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

29:10.100 --> 29:11.168
OK.

29:19.309 --> 29:20.344
OK.

29:25.716 --> 29:27.017
Not sketchy at all.

29:28.719 --> 29:31.789
Tonight! In true ERL fashion,

29:31.823 --> 29:33.690
we are taking you to the most
intense,

29:33.724 --> 29:39.429
the most hyper-exclusive,
escape room in Moscow.

29:39.463 --> 29:42.432
That's right! Just for you,
they're letting us tie

29:42.466 --> 29:44.101
into their cameras

29:44.134 --> 29:45.770
so you all can watch
what's happening live.

29:45.803 --> 29:51.208
And because every experience
is completely different,

29:51.241 --> 29:53.110
You never know what's gonna
happen! Oh, my God.

29:53.143 --> 29:54.846
Alexei, come here, come here.

29:54.879 --> 29:57.114
Is there any way they can find
this place online

29:57.147 --> 29:58.515
Do you have a website?
Do you have a profile?

29:58.549 --> 30:00.384
Do you have a hashtag?
Do you have any...

30:00.417 --> 30:03.420
- No.
- No, you don't! Because ERL is the only place

30:03.453 --> 30:05.122
you can get this content.
That's right! Uh!

30:05.155 --> 30:07.190
You guys ready or what?

30:07.224 --> 30:10.727
- Not as much as you. Jesus Christ!
- All right, let's do this.

30:10.762 --> 30:12.696
OK, Cole,
they will begin streaming it

30:12.729 --> 30:16.133
- directly into your device.
- Let's do it.

30:16.166 --> 30:17.200
OK.

30:19.169 --> 30:21.171
All right.

30:21.204 --> 30:24.708
Don't lose that.
Don't lose that phone.

30:24.741 --> 30:30.380
They are good to go.

30:30.414 --> 30:33.751
My backup phone.
Hope they don't find all my nudes.

30:33.785 --> 30:35.686
Just kidding, just kidding.
Erin, stop.

30:35.719 --> 30:37.354
It's a joke.

30:37.387 --> 30:38.422
But how much fun
would they be?

30:39.857 --> 30:42.392
- Scared?
- No.

30:42.426 --> 30:44.762
So, what do you think
they're doing?

30:44.796 --> 30:46.730
I don't got a clue.

30:46.764 --> 30:47.832
It's like that.

30:50.467 --> 30:51.735
Fuck.

30:51.769 --> 30:53.303
Who are these guys?

30:53.337 --> 30:54.504
They'll be
taking you inside.

30:54.538 --> 30:56.306
But they only speak
Russian.

30:56.340 --> 30:58.275
So I told them I'd give you
instructions in English.

30:58.308 --> 31:01.712
You're being held
in a Bolshevik prison.

31:01.745 --> 31:03.915
This is a facility where
enemies of the state

31:03.948 --> 31:08.151
were tortured, questioned
and killed.

31:08.185 --> 31:10.788
The last man executed
is still inside.

31:10.822 --> 31:15.292
He stole the cell block key and
hid it in the only place he could.

31:15.325 --> 31:17.795
They tortured him.
Starved him.

31:17.829 --> 31:20.263
But he never gave it up.

31:20.297 --> 31:22.800
You must release
your companions

31:22.834 --> 31:24.401
before the timer runs out.

31:26.570 --> 31:28.572
And they are executed.

32:21.358 --> 32:22.392
Fuck.

32:44.882 --> 32:45.917
What?

32:47.451 --> 32:50.587
This is crazy.

33:03.533 --> 33:04.568
Ugh.

33:27.657 --> 33:29.894
Yo, guys, this place is legit.

33:29.927 --> 33:31.528
Hey, Cole!

33:33.630 --> 33:34.832
Yeah?

33:34.866 --> 33:37.334
Is anybody else
down here?

33:37.367 --> 33:38.535
Yeah, me.

33:40.437 --> 33:43.074
I'm... I'm strapped
into some kind of... machine.

33:43.107 --> 33:44.341
OK.

33:48.079 --> 33:49.312
Ugh.

33:49.679 --> 33:50.680
Cole!

33:50.714 --> 33:52.349
OK, hang tight!

33:54.551 --> 33:55.585
OK.

34:00.724 --> 34:01.759
Oof.

34:04.694 --> 34:05.729
This guy real?

34:09.733 --> 34:10.768
Holy shit.

34:13.537 --> 34:17.008
I think I'm supposed to
cut this guy open?

34:23.613 --> 34:25.615
This is really weird.

34:25.649 --> 34:28.685
Super creepy. I, uh,
am feeling a little weird about it.

34:30.620 --> 34:32.089
No one's gonna stop me?

34:35.525 --> 34:36.726
Oh, my goodness.

34:36.761 --> 34:39.696
I got this.

34:39.729 --> 34:41.398
All right.

34:41.431 --> 34:43.134
This is so sketch.

34:43.167 --> 34:44.668
All right.

34:47.504 --> 34:48.572
I'm gonna do it.

34:51.108 --> 34:52.375
Oh, shit.

35:00.084 --> 35:01.118
Ugh.

35:02.119 --> 35:03.486
Ew, weird.

35:14.031 --> 35:16.834
Uh... I don't know
what I'm looking for.

35:18.169 --> 35:19.837
OK, it's not there.

35:21.072 --> 35:22.739
Sorry, man, it's weird
for me, too.

35:32.183 --> 35:34.118
This is so sick.

35:35.820 --> 35:36.854
Oh.

35:42.626 --> 35:43.660
Oh!

35:48.833 --> 35:50.067
Ugh.

36:25.568 --> 36:27.104
Erin!

36:27.138 --> 36:29.572
Erin! Are you OK?

36:29.606 --> 36:31.108
This is
so fuckin' crazy.

36:33.844 --> 36:36.579
The key. The key.
I don't know what to do.

36:37.181 --> 36:38.783
Hello!

36:38.816 --> 36:41.218
OK. I'll be right back.

36:43.720 --> 36:44.789
OK.

36:59.904 --> 37:02.139
Hey, Sam.
How you doin'?

37:02.173 --> 37:03.874
Nice to see you
doin' good.

37:03.908 --> 37:05.076
Man, this shit
is uncomfortable.

37:05.109 --> 37:07.144
Hey, Alexei was not joking.

37:07.178 --> 37:09.213
Do you guys think
this is a real prison?

37:09.246 --> 37:10.915
I think it's a real prison.

37:10.948 --> 37:13.583
<i>Ha ha! I told you!</i>

37:13.616 --> 37:16.519
Oh, so you guys are watching.

37:16.553 --> 37:18.289
<i>Better get going, baby face.</i>

37:18.322 --> 37:20.758
<i>Your friends don't have</i>
<i>much time left.</i>

37:22.293 --> 37:24.594
Baby face.
Hey, everybody.

37:24.627 --> 37:26.563
I'm gonna solve
all these puzzles quick.

37:26.596 --> 37:27.697
Watch this.

37:29.200 --> 37:30.835
Hey, something's
happening down here.

37:30.868 --> 37:32.269
'Kay, coming.

37:32.303 --> 37:33.670
Hey, seriously.
Get down here, man.

37:33.703 --> 37:34.772
This is starting to hurt.

37:38.909 --> 37:39.910
Finally.

37:39.944 --> 37:42.079
Wow. Look at you guys.

37:42.113 --> 37:43.781
Where's Erin and Sam?

37:43.814 --> 37:45.116
You guys are all in
different torture devices.

37:45.149 --> 37:46.817
Sam's in an electric chair,

37:46.851 --> 37:49.887
and Erin is down there
in some sort of a tank?

37:49.920 --> 37:53.858
Oh, OK.
Yo, what happened to your hands?

37:53.891 --> 37:55.625
The key that I used
to get in here,

37:55.658 --> 37:59.230
I had to cut out
of a guy's stomach!

37:59.263 --> 38:00.697
This is blood!

38:00.730 --> 38:02.665
Like a real dude?

38:02.699 --> 38:05.336
Yes, Dash.
Like a real dead Russian.

38:05.369 --> 38:06.904
From the war.

38:08.906 --> 38:11.175
No! I don't know, man!
I don't know.

38:11.208 --> 38:12.243
- I don't know.
- Crazy.

38:12.276 --> 38:13.944
I mean, look where we are.

38:13.978 --> 38:16.213
You had me, though.
Not gonna lie. You had me.

38:16.247 --> 38:17.948
Guys. O-OK,
serious, though.

38:17.982 --> 38:20.583
Uh, when that door opened,
this started pulling.

38:21.986 --> 38:23.620
- This door?
- Hey!

38:23.653 --> 38:25.688
This thing right here
is starting to close.

38:25.722 --> 38:27.158
O-OK.

38:27.191 --> 38:28.926
Uh, each of the rooms
across from you guys

38:28.959 --> 38:31.328
have puzzles and those are
the only doors that are open.

38:31.362 --> 38:32.595
I guess I just need to
solve them and... and

38:32.629 --> 38:33.964
I'll get you guys out.

38:33.998 --> 38:36.834
Just stay right there.
Don't move.

38:36.867 --> 38:38.701
OK. I mean, we
can't go anywhere but, yeah.

38:38.735 --> 38:39.870
- Hang tight.
- Cole!

38:39.904 --> 38:41.372
- I know.
- Jesus!

38:41.405 --> 38:47.278
Huh. So these probably connect
to Dash's cell.

38:47.311 --> 38:51.949
And then there's more
in that room. Huh.

38:51.982 --> 38:54.584
OK, please hurry.

38:59.957 --> 39:02.860
Hey... Yo, where are you going, bro?
These things are sharp!

39:02.893 --> 39:04.261
You'll be fine.

39:04.295 --> 39:05.695
Hurry!

39:05.728 --> 39:06.864
Oh, yeah.

39:08.399 --> 39:11.335
What up, kids?
I'm using gears to solve puzzles

39:11.368 --> 39:13.070
to save my friends' lives.

39:14.839 --> 39:16.207
- Lives are at stake.
- Hey, Cole!

39:16.240 --> 39:17.707
Yeah, buddy.

39:17.740 --> 39:19.276
I don't mean to sound
like a wimp

39:19.310 --> 39:20.878
but this is starting
to get uncomfortable.

39:20.911 --> 39:22.813
Aww, Thomas.

39:22.847 --> 39:24.281
- Is this a little scawy for you?
- Man, whatever, G.

39:24.315 --> 39:25.748
You sound like a wimp!

39:25.783 --> 39:26.749
I'm gonna need you
to hang tight.

39:28.919 --> 39:31.654
Oh! Ah!

39:31.688 --> 39:32.790
Oh, boy.

39:32.823 --> 39:33.824
Hold on!

39:34.992 --> 39:36.227
This is gonna be
a piece of cake.

39:36.260 --> 39:37.161
What was that?

39:37.194 --> 39:38.229
Sorry.

39:38.262 --> 39:39.330
Sorry.

39:39.363 --> 39:40.865
OK, all right.

39:40.898 --> 39:42.665
Dude, these things
are coming close.

39:42.699 --> 39:44.068
I think now's a good time

39:44.101 --> 39:45.836
to let you guys know
I'm claustrophobic.

39:45.870 --> 39:47.737
Yup! I think it's this one.

39:49.039 --> 39:50.407
Cole, it's tightening!

39:50.740 --> 39:52.309
Oh!

39:52.343 --> 39:53.743
Cole!

39:53.777 --> 39:55.446
I got it.

39:55.479 --> 39:57.047
Get me out
of this shit!

39:57.081 --> 39:58.782
Oh! Uh, yeah, man.

39:58.816 --> 40:00.284
You probably should speed up
for his sake.

40:00.317 --> 40:02.019
OK, whoa. Whoa.

40:02.052 --> 40:03.720
Yeah, hold on!

40:05.923 --> 40:07.958
Whatever you did, don't do it.

40:07.992 --> 40:09.059
It's getting faster!
It's getting faster!

40:09.093 --> 40:10.261
Yes! Almost done!

40:10.294 --> 40:11.862
Yo, where are you going?

40:11.896 --> 40:12.930
Where are you running?

40:12.963 --> 40:14.798
I gotta do the other side!

40:16.167 --> 40:18.836
Seriously, this is starting
to hurt!

40:18.869 --> 40:19.970
So heavy, dude.
Hold on.

40:20.504 --> 40:22.072
OK, whoa. Whoa.

40:22.106 --> 40:23.941
Uh, this is not OK.

40:23.974 --> 40:25.009
Oh, dammit!

40:26.911 --> 40:28.012
Ah!

40:28.045 --> 40:29.346
Fix my shit first!

40:29.380 --> 40:31.048
OK, OK, OK...
B-b-b-b-b-back!

40:31.081 --> 40:33.050
Ooh-ooh. Great. OK.

40:34.785 --> 40:36.754
This is starting to get
a little fucking painful!

40:36.787 --> 40:37.888
Hey, Thomas, hold on!

40:38.756 --> 40:40.024
Hold on!

40:43.127 --> 40:44.161
B-b-b-b-b-b!

40:46.497 --> 40:47.965
Whoa-whoa-whoa!

40:52.903 --> 40:53.971
Last one!

40:55.906 --> 40:56.974
Oh!

40:58.876 --> 41:00.743
Ooh-oh. Oh! Oh, shit.

41:02.213 --> 41:04.815
Thank God. That was
way too fucking close.

41:06.016 --> 41:07.918
Oh. It worked.

41:07.952 --> 41:09.787
Guys! I think I did it.

41:11.422 --> 41:13.090
Let me tell you how
claustrophobic I was getting.

41:16.393 --> 41:17.962
All right! Thomasito,
I'm coming for ya.

41:17.995 --> 41:21.966
Cole, get me out of this shit.

41:21.999 --> 41:24.535
I know Alexei said this was
gonna hurt, but that shit was intense.

41:24.568 --> 41:26.837
Look, we're running
out of time.

41:26.870 --> 41:28.072
<i>Oh,
you better get moving, guys.</i>

41:28.105 --> 41:29.340
Even he saw that.

41:29.373 --> 41:30.874
Come on. Phantom Alexei.

41:30.908 --> 41:31.875
Get this shit
over with.

41:35.412 --> 41:36.981
Oh, God. This is
even kinky for you.

41:37.014 --> 41:38.482
- I'm not gonna lie.
- Just get me out of here.

41:38.515 --> 41:42.019
- We can't hear you.
- Get me out of here!

41:42.052 --> 41:44.955
Guys, I ain't
fucking...

41:44.989 --> 41:46.790
Just come on, man.

41:46.824 --> 41:49.893
All right.
We'll be back.

41:49.927 --> 41:51.962
Unless you don't want us
to help you. Do you need help?

41:51.996 --> 41:53.230
Come on, man.
Fuck you, man.

41:53.264 --> 41:54.832
- What?
- Nothing. Get me out of here!

41:55.566 --> 41:57.067
You... you like the chair?

41:57.101 --> 41:59.169
You like...

41:59.203 --> 42:01.038
- You play too much, come on!
- What?

42:01.071 --> 42:02.840
All right, this looks
pretty straight-forward.

42:02.873 --> 42:05.175
Yeah.

42:05.209 --> 42:08.012
- It's just a maze.
- Duh, it's a maze, Cole.

42:08.045 --> 42:09.913
This is pretty cool, though.

42:09.947 --> 42:11.415
OK, so...

42:11.448 --> 42:13.450
You gotta go this way, yeah?

42:13.484 --> 42:15.185
I guess it goes around?

42:15.219 --> 42:16.387
Damn!

42:17.588 --> 42:19.089
Whoa! Yo.

42:19.123 --> 42:21.425
I think you just shocked her.

42:21.458 --> 42:23.193
<i>Hey,
you should be more careful with that, huh?</i>

42:23.227 --> 42:25.195
Oh, OK. Let me see
this. Move, move, move.

42:25.229 --> 42:27.931
Yeah, but, hey. But did you
hear what they said?

42:27.965 --> 42:30.134
- Yeah.
- You got to be careful.

42:30.167 --> 42:32.169
- Be careful.
- Guys, guys. Come on. Let's get out of here.

42:32.202 --> 42:34.004
All right. OK.

42:34.038 --> 42:36.440
All right, so what'd you do
to shock her? You just... that?

42:39.243 --> 42:40.611
Oh ho. Whoops!

42:43.614 --> 42:45.182
Easy, easy, easy.

42:46.450 --> 42:47.618
This is crazy. Look.

42:47.651 --> 42:49.086
Dash! Dash, stop! Stop!

42:49.119 --> 42:50.554
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

42:52.256 --> 42:53.223
- Stop, guys! Easy!
- Thomas, relax.

42:53.257 --> 42:54.625
-Yo, what the fuck?

42:54.658 --> 42:55.893
Look! I think it's actually
hurting her!

43:00.064 --> 43:01.565
Relax, bro! It's a game!

43:03.267 --> 43:04.468
Samantha, is this hurting you?

43:05.903 --> 43:06.904
Should we get them
to stop this game?

43:09.640 --> 43:11.208
What the fuck?
Here, give it to me.

43:11.241 --> 43:14.978
- Be easy!
- Stop! No! Let go.

43:15.012 --> 43:16.980
- It goes this way.
- I know where it goes.

43:17.014 --> 43:18.382
I'm just tryin' to
tell you, I mapped it already.

43:18.415 --> 43:20.017
- Make a right!
- It's all right, I got it.

43:20.050 --> 43:20.918
Be quick about it.
Make a right.

43:20.951 --> 43:21.885
No!

43:24.254 --> 43:25.255
Come on,
come on!

43:26.190 --> 43:27.591
Easy, there.
You got a right.

43:29.393 --> 43:30.227
- Easy, easy!
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

43:30.260 --> 43:31.261
Left.

43:31.295 --> 43:32.463
OK!

43:32.496 --> 43:33.931
Make a right.

43:33.964 --> 43:35.065
Shit.

43:36.700 --> 43:39.002
You got a right,
and then a left.

43:41.438 --> 43:42.539
You guys, how you doing
in there?

43:42.573 --> 43:44.041
I'm trying, shut up!

43:44.074 --> 43:45.242
I'm trying to help you!

43:47.311 --> 43:49.513
Now you gotta make a
right up here and then a left.

43:51.248 --> 43:52.616
Come on, you got it.

43:52.649 --> 43:54.218
You're close, you're close,
you're close.

43:54.251 --> 43:55.619
- H-hey!
- You got it!

43:55.652 --> 43:56.887
Let's go!

44:01.525 --> 44:03.160
Get this off me, man.

44:05.562 --> 44:06.930
What just happened?

44:06.964 --> 44:07.965
I'm so sorry, Sam.

44:07.998 --> 44:08.966
How bad was that?

44:08.999 --> 44:10.100
I feel sick.

44:12.536 --> 44:14.705
That shit wasn't
right, man.

44:14.738 --> 44:16.607
That shit wasn't right at all.

44:16.640 --> 44:19.309
Well, Alexei said that this
was gonna be pretty intense.

44:19.343 --> 44:21.311
- Fuckin' Alexei, man.
- This place is pretty intense.

44:21.345 --> 44:23.247
Y'all think this is funny, huh?

44:23.280 --> 44:25.282
Yo, yo, Sam. It's a game.
It's supposed to be...

44:25.315 --> 44:30.020
Fuck that, Cole! This shit don't
feel like no game no more, man.

44:30.053 --> 44:32.089
Sam, if you want to leave,
we can just leave right now.

44:32.122 --> 44:33.490
You know I want to leave, man.

44:33.524 --> 44:34.725
I don't wanna stay here no
more, Dashell.

44:34.759 --> 44:37.194
I wanna go!

44:37.227 --> 44:38.429
Look, why is nobody
answering us?

44:38.462 --> 44:40.197
I don't know.
Alexei, hello?!

44:40.230 --> 44:42.199
Guys! Hello?! Hello?!

44:42.232 --> 44:43.700
What do you mean you don't
know? This is your guy.

44:43.734 --> 44:44.735
- You were just talkin' to him.
- yeah.

44:44.769 --> 44:46.036
Where's he at now?

44:46.069 --> 44:47.604
I don't know him all that well!

44:47.638 --> 44:49.339
- What do you mean you don't know him that well?
- What?

44:49.373 --> 44:51.708
I don't know, I met him
and he said he loved his vlogs.

44:51.742 --> 44:53.610
He's some rich guy.
He said he did this before.

44:53.644 --> 44:55.112
There's no way
this kid did this, man.

44:55.145 --> 44:56.547
I don't know
what to tell you guys.

44:56.580 --> 44:58.048
All I know is just as much
as you guys.

44:58.081 --> 44:59.550
They change it every
single time.

44:59.583 --> 45:00.717
It's intense.

45:00.752 --> 45:02.019
But it's a game!

45:02.052 --> 45:04.288
Dash. We're in Russia

45:04.321 --> 45:06.089
with some guy
that you barely know

45:06.123 --> 45:08.325
in some old prison?
Or wherever we are.

45:08.358 --> 45:11.728
Are you fucking crazy?

45:11.763 --> 45:13.697
How could I be
so stupid?

45:13.730 --> 45:15.767
- This is so like you.
- What do you mean? Fuck... Fuck you!

45:15.800 --> 45:17.501
What do you mean
"it's like" me?

45:17.534 --> 45:19.603
You came on this trip, too.
Just fucking chill.

45:19.636 --> 45:21.672
He's probably laughing at you right now.
He's messing with us.

45:21.705 --> 45:23.440
He's not messing with us, Dash.

45:24.809 --> 45:26.009
Guys?

45:26.043 --> 45:27.110
What?!

45:27.144 --> 45:28.145
Get over here.

45:36.119 --> 45:37.387
Oh, my God. Erin!

45:37.421 --> 45:39.189
- Shit!
- Erin, are you OK?

45:39.223 --> 45:40.724
How long do you think
it's gonna take to fill up?

45:40.758 --> 45:42.092
I don't know, if she's
OK... Are you OK?!

45:43.393 --> 45:44.628
She doesn't know
what's going on.

45:44.661 --> 45:46.663
She didn't even see
what happened to me.

45:46.697 --> 45:47.698
- That's true.
- I don't think she can even hear us.

45:47.731 --> 45:49.666
Erin! Can you hear us?!

45:49.700 --> 45:51.702
Cole. Can you hear her?

45:51.735 --> 45:53.403
Fuck!

45:53.437 --> 45:54.338
All right, where did you guys
just start from?

45:54.371 --> 45:56.139
From down there.

45:56.173 --> 45:59.076
Our devices hurt but not as bad
as that electric chair.

45:59.109 --> 46:00.410
I bet.

46:00.444 --> 46:03.313
Alexei, what gives, bro?!
What's next?

46:03.347 --> 46:04.648
Are you even there?

46:04.681 --> 46:05.817
Hello?!

46:05.850 --> 46:07.050
Dash, they're not
gonna help us.

46:07.084 --> 46:08.118
We're on our own.

46:14.826 --> 46:16.059
OK.

46:16.828 --> 46:18.095
This is just like
the other rooms.

46:19.831 --> 46:22.165
We need to figure it out and
get her out now!

46:22.199 --> 46:23.267
Now, now, now!

46:24.434 --> 46:26.470
We're gonna be
right back!

46:29.339 --> 46:30.407
Uh...

46:30.440 --> 46:32.075
What the hell
is this?

46:32.409 --> 46:33.377
Ugh.

46:33.410 --> 46:37.849
OK. Uh, three L, five L

46:37.882 --> 46:40.183
Well, it's like that thing
from <i>Die Hard</i>.

46:40.217 --> 46:42.152
I mean, then we also did it
at school once, too.

46:42.185 --> 46:43.487
What?

46:43.520 --> 46:44.688
Come on, man. We used to
love that movie.

46:44.721 --> 46:46.256
It's an old puzzle.

46:46.290 --> 46:47.859
Well, just, get her out
of there, OK?

46:47.892 --> 46:49.560
- Let's solve it and get her out.
- All right.

46:49.593 --> 46:51.528
OK, I got this, guys.
Use the three-liter jug

46:51.562 --> 46:54.231
and the five-liter jug to get
precisely four liters of water.

46:54.264 --> 46:56.400
So first we need to fill up
the five-liter jug.

46:59.904 --> 47:01.672
How she doing
over there?

47:01.705 --> 47:03.206
She's not freaking out,
so that's good.

47:03.240 --> 47:05.475
Great. Now we pour
the five-liter jug

47:05.509 --> 47:08.412
into the three-liter jug.
We need to fill that all the way up.

47:08.445 --> 47:09.713
Help me out here.

47:09.746 --> 47:10.747
That's in the three-liter.

47:10.782 --> 47:12.149
Try to help me, all right.

47:12.182 --> 47:13.483
Thank you.

47:13.517 --> 47:15.753
Careful, we can't waste
any of this.

47:17.454 --> 47:18.522
All right, stop.

47:19.757 --> 47:21.325
Now.

47:21.358 --> 47:22.794
That leaves us with two
liters of water

47:22.827 --> 47:24.661
in the five-liter jug.

47:24.695 --> 47:26.296
So now we need to empty out
the entire three-liter jug.

47:28.332 --> 47:29.399
Um...

47:32.402 --> 47:33.470
Come on, Thomas.

47:34.438 --> 47:35.907
Great. Now quickly.

47:35.940 --> 47:37.708
Let's put the two liters
in the three-liter jug.

47:37.741 --> 47:38.810
Help me out again?

47:42.312 --> 47:43.380
Great, keep going.

47:44.916 --> 47:46.149
Yup.

47:46.550 --> 47:47.718
- All right.
- OK.

47:47.752 --> 47:49.620
Sweet!

47:49.653 --> 47:51.488
All right. Now two liters are
in the three-liter jug, OK?

47:51.521 --> 47:53.825
Which gives us room
for one more liter.

47:53.858 --> 47:56.159
Let's fill up the
five-liter jug...

47:59.831 --> 48:03.768
All right. Now time to top off
the three-liter jug.

48:03.801 --> 48:05.402
Last step, guys.
Come on.

48:05.435 --> 48:07.805
Thank you.

48:07.839 --> 48:09.941
You remember all this from
<i>Die Hard</i>?

48:09.974 --> 48:11.241
And perfect. Stop!

48:11.274 --> 48:12.309
All right, great.

48:12.342 --> 48:13.878
That should leave us with

48:13.911 --> 48:17.849
exactly four liters of water
in the five liter jug.

48:17.882 --> 48:19.951
- Come on, Thomas.
- How are we lookin'? How's Erin doing?

48:19.984 --> 48:21.284
You're really
cuttin' it close.

48:21.318 --> 48:22.352
I know, I know.
Hold on.

48:27.524 --> 48:28.558
There.

48:37.401 --> 48:38.535
- Oh, my God, Erin!
- Shit!

48:38.568 --> 48:40.704
Erin!
Are you OK?

48:40.737 --> 48:41.973
All right, we need
to get her out of here.

48:42.006 --> 48:43.206
How are we supposed
to do that?!

48:43.240 --> 48:44.307
This is the key!

48:44.341 --> 48:45.442
The key, the key, uh...

48:45.475 --> 48:46.978
Is there a latch
or something?

48:47.011 --> 48:48.278
- I don't see anything.
- I don't see any.

48:49.546 --> 48:50.547
Hey, there's a hatch on top!

48:50.580 --> 48:51.648
OK, uh...

48:53.617 --> 48:54.852
Here, grab one!

48:56.453 --> 48:57.855
- Dash!
- She has the key.

49:00.590 --> 49:01.658
Hold on.

49:11.836 --> 49:13.004
It's rusted shut!

49:13.037 --> 49:14.705
What do you mean
it's rusted shut?

49:14.738 --> 49:16.540
- It's rusted shut, man!
- It's not rusted shut!

49:16.573 --> 49:17.909
- Just pull harder!
- That's what I'm doing, man!

49:17.942 --> 49:19.010
Turn it! Turn it at the same time.
Come on!

49:21.311 --> 49:22.279
God, fuck!

49:22.312 --> 49:23.346
Oh, my God.

49:27.284 --> 49:28.652
Come on!

49:28.685 --> 49:30.320
Ah, it should be
fucking opening!

49:30.353 --> 49:32.355
What's going on?

49:32.389 --> 49:33.858
She's gonna fucking drown!

49:33.891 --> 49:35.258
Find something to
break this open, Cole!

49:35.292 --> 49:36.560
Erin!

49:40.664 --> 49:42.566
Fuck. I don't know
what to do.

49:42.599 --> 49:43.835
I don't know what to do.

49:43.868 --> 49:44.936
I know.

49:47.004 --> 49:48.371
Cole, she's gonna
fucking drown!

49:48.405 --> 49:50.273
Alexei, what the fuck!

49:50.307 --> 49:51.441
That's enough!
Stop the game!

49:51.475 --> 49:52.877
We can't get her out!

49:52.910 --> 49:54.912
Alexei! Victoria!

49:54.946 --> 49:57.647
Stop the game!
We can't get her out!

49:57.681 --> 49:58.715
Fuck!

50:02.887 --> 50:04.856
Alexei!

50:04.889 --> 50:06.289
Anyone?

50:17.902 --> 50:18.970
Fuck!

50:19.003 --> 50:20.270
Alexei! Anyone!

50:21.973 --> 50:23.507
Erin!

50:23.540 --> 50:24.741
No, no, no, no!

50:27.444 --> 50:29.379
Alexei! Where the fuck
are you?!

50:32.049 --> 50:33.416
Fuck, man.

50:33.450 --> 50:34.684
We're never gonna
get this off!

50:38.655 --> 50:40.024
Shit. Shit.

50:47.631 --> 50:48.766
Move! Move!

50:54.138 --> 50:55.572
Fuck!

51:03.713 --> 51:05.783
Erin!

51:13.157 --> 51:14.992
Help me! Help me!

51:15.026 --> 51:16.093
Help me!

51:18.562 --> 51:19.629
Erin!

51:24.601 --> 51:26.436
Help me!

51:27.504 --> 51:29.073
Yeah. Oh, God.

51:30.540 --> 51:33.376
Erin! Erin! Erin!

51:33.410 --> 51:34.678
Slow, slow, slow.

51:34.711 --> 51:36.379
Watch her head.
I don't know.

51:36.413 --> 51:38.548
Erin! Erin!

51:38.582 --> 51:39.583
Oh, my God.

51:39.616 --> 51:42.019
Erin!

51:42.053 --> 51:43.087
- Erin!
- She's not breathing!

51:43.120 --> 51:44.454
What do we do?

51:44.487 --> 51:45.722
Give her mouth-to-mouth!

51:47.557 --> 51:49.060
Oh, my God!
Oh! Oh, my God!

51:51.095 --> 51:52.596
Oh!

51:52.629 --> 51:54.698
Get her up, get her up,
get her up.

51:54.731 --> 51:56.466
Thank God
you're OK.

52:03.174 --> 52:04.441
Thank God, thank God.

52:05.675 --> 52:06.811
What the fuck is that?
Is it over?

52:08.445 --> 52:10.047
Fuck that.
Are you OK?

52:10.081 --> 52:11.715
I'm OK.

52:13.184 --> 52:14.417
- OK, OK. She...
- I'm OK

52:14.451 --> 52:15.953
- You good?
- Uh-huh. OK.

52:15.987 --> 52:17.654
Fuck!

52:17.687 --> 52:18.789
I don't get it. Why the fuck
didn't they come?

52:18.823 --> 52:20.557
Why did they say?

52:20.590 --> 52:22.425
I tried to... I... We
couldn't do anything!

52:22.459 --> 52:24.427
Because Alexei was helping us
and then he was just gone!

52:24.461 --> 52:26.496
We was yellin' to them the
whole entire time, Erin.

52:26.529 --> 52:27.530
We... we... Let's go.

52:27.564 --> 52:29.166
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

52:29.200 --> 52:30.567
Wait, hey, hey. That's...
that's gotta be the key

52:30.600 --> 52:32.136
for the end
of the hall.

52:33.170 --> 52:34.138
Yeah, let's go.

52:34.171 --> 52:35.172
Let's go.

52:35.206 --> 52:36.473
- Can you get up?
- Mm-hmm.

52:43.513 --> 52:44.581
Fuck this place.

52:52.089 --> 52:54.158
Alexei, what the fuck?

53:00.697 --> 53:01.698
What the fuck?

53:01.731 --> 53:02.800
Whoa, shit!

53:03.600 --> 53:04.668
Alexei?

53:05.535 --> 53:06.670
Hello?

53:06.703 --> 53:08.105
What the hell is this?

53:08.139 --> 53:09.206
Alexei?

53:10.707 --> 53:11.876
Dash,
the door, the door!

53:11.909 --> 53:12.810
- Fuck!
- Fuck!

53:12.843 --> 53:13.911
No, no.

53:13.945 --> 53:15.246
What happened here?

53:15.279 --> 53:16.746
I... I don't know.

53:16.781 --> 53:18.883
But whatever it was,
it was bad.

53:18.916 --> 53:20.517
- We were just talking to Alexei and then he stopped.
- OK.

53:20.550 --> 53:22.086
What if this is
still part of it?

53:22.119 --> 53:23.520
No, fuck, no. We lost.

53:23.553 --> 53:24.688
Look at the timer.
It's over.

53:24.721 --> 53:26.523
Someone should be here.

53:26.556 --> 53:28.159
Someone should've been here
a long time ago

53:28.192 --> 53:29.760
after what happened in there.

53:29.794 --> 53:32.129
Maybe the audience saw it
on my feed and they're

53:32.163 --> 53:33.764
sending help or...

53:33.798 --> 53:35.665
I don't think so.
I don't see any cameras.

53:35.699 --> 53:37.268
- There's blood on the wall.
- What?!

53:37.301 --> 53:38.568
Fuck!

53:39.569 --> 53:40.603
- Cole!

53:42.639 --> 53:43.808
What do we do?

53:43.841 --> 53:45.142
What do we do?

53:45.176 --> 53:46.877
Uh, I don't know. Uh...

53:46.911 --> 53:48.545
It's jammed, the door's locked!

53:48.578 --> 53:50.081
This won't open either.

53:50.114 --> 53:52.216
OK, hold on.
Let me try.

53:52.249 --> 53:53.884
- Shit!
- OK, think.

53:53.918 --> 53:55.152
Maybe we can
break the lock.

53:55.186 --> 53:57.254
OK, hold...

53:57.288 --> 53:59.223
Maybe we should
stay here.

53:59.256 --> 54:01.624
If there's actual danger,
this is the best place to be.

54:01.658 --> 54:03.526
We'll just wait for the security
to come back.

54:03.560 --> 54:05.628
Yeah, he's right.
That makes sense.

54:05.662 --> 54:06.730
What are you doing?

54:09.934 --> 54:11.634
Cole.

54:11.668 --> 54:15.806
Cole! Cole! Wait! No!

54:15.840 --> 54:17.241
Dude, what the fuck?!

54:17.274 --> 54:18.742
We're getting out of there now.

54:18.776 --> 54:19.877
Fuck that, I'm not
going out there.

54:19.910 --> 54:21.145
None of us should.

54:21.178 --> 54:22.746
Everybody, listen.

54:22.780 --> 54:24.782
We don't have any
identification.

54:24.815 --> 54:26.183
We are in a strange country.

54:26.217 --> 54:27.717
We don't have our phones,
our wallets,

54:27.752 --> 54:29.619
our passports, anything.

54:29.652 --> 54:31.654
We need to leave now!

54:31.688 --> 54:33.190
We're gonna stick together
and find help!

54:34.591 --> 54:35.658
Oh, what the fuck?!

54:35.692 --> 54:37.294
Oh, my God.

54:55.312 --> 54:56.579
No, no, no! Wait!

54:58.883 --> 55:00.051
Oh, my God!

55:00.084 --> 55:02.820
Erin? Thomas?

55:04.121 --> 55:05.588
What are you
doing to us?

55:05.622 --> 55:07.324
What do you want?
Where's Alexei?

55:12.695 --> 55:14.965
What do you want
with us?

55:14.999 --> 55:17.968
Let go of me!
Where are my friends?

55:20.703 --> 55:21.972
Oh, my God.

55:30.014 --> 55:31.048
Oh, my God.

55:39.423 --> 55:40.657
Hello, Cole.

55:41.724 --> 55:42.927
Who... who is that?

55:44.328 --> 55:45.662
How do you know my name?

55:55.840 --> 55:56.907
Who are you?

55:58.309 --> 55:59.376
What is this?

56:01.312 --> 56:02.379
Oh, my God.

56:03.713 --> 56:06.283
Please, please, please.

56:07.952 --> 56:10.387
You fucking Americans.

56:12.957 --> 56:15.426
This is... this is a mistake.

56:15.459 --> 56:16.760
You think you're so safe?

56:16.794 --> 56:17.895
M-misunderstanding.

56:17.928 --> 56:19.296
Mm?

56:19.330 --> 56:20.730
I don't know...
I don't know who you are.

56:20.764 --> 56:23.334
When a man is shot
in the head,

56:23.367 --> 56:25.369
there's so much blood.

56:27.004 --> 56:29.773
Nothing can prepare you
for it.

56:30.774 --> 56:32.376
It goes everywhere.

56:37.948 --> 56:38.983
Who am I?

56:42.086 --> 56:44.355
I'll show you who I am.

56:50.928 --> 56:52.263
Bam!

56:52.296 --> 56:53.330
Fuck!

56:58.836 --> 57:00.771
My friends and I
were just visiting,

57:00.804 --> 57:02.806
having fun.
We went to a club,

57:02.840 --> 57:04.741
I... I don't know what happened.

57:04.775 --> 57:06.076
We just want to go home.

57:06.110 --> 57:08.012
Please, please, please.

57:11.815 --> 57:13.083
What is this?

57:13.117 --> 57:14.852
Are you broadcasting this?

57:19.523 --> 57:21.825
Exclusive.

57:21.859 --> 57:25.095
American

57:25.129 --> 57:30.100
Huh?

57:32.403 --> 57:33.904
Celebrity!

57:39.343 --> 57:40.844
Celebrity.

57:40.878 --> 57:41.979
No.

57:45.082 --> 57:46.083
Gah!

57:46.116 --> 57:47.952
You know how much they pay

57:47.985 --> 57:50.354
to watch people like you
get torn apart

57:50.387 --> 57:51.422
piece by piece?

57:53.924 --> 57:55.926
- They love to watch.
- No!

57:57.027 --> 57:58.362
What are you doing?

57:58.395 --> 57:59.863
They love to decide

57:59.897 --> 58:01.332
how we do it.

58:01.365 --> 58:02.433
Oh, please.

58:02.466 --> 58:03.867
No!

58:03.901 --> 58:05.936
And first up, is the girl!

58:05.970 --> 58:07.037
No, don't you fucking...

58:07.071 --> 58:08.839
Don't you fucking touch her!

58:10.574 --> 58:12.176
No, no, please.

58:12.209 --> 58:14.078
We'll kill one of you
every half hour.

58:14.111 --> 58:15.479
No! No!

58:16.547 --> 58:19.984
No, no, no, please!

58:32.196 --> 58:33.998
Please, please!

58:48.512 --> 58:49.780
Oh, my God.

59:02.493 --> 59:03.527
Fuck!

59:19.977 --> 59:21.178
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

59:24.948 --> 59:26.550
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

59:28.585 --> 59:31.555
<i>What the fuck
are you doing, man?</i>

59:35.225 --> 59:37.494
<i>Come on, man.
We can work this out...</i>

59:39.263 --> 59:40.130
<i>Are you fuckin'
filming this?</i>

59:41.999 --> 59:43.567
<i>I promise if you
let me out of here,</i>

59:43.600 --> 59:46.603
<i>I'm gonna fuck you up, man!</i>

59:46.637 --> 59:48.906
<i>What is all that
stuff you're sayin', man?</i>

59:48.939 --> 59:50.974
<i>Man, what are you doing, man?</i>

59:51.008 --> 59:52.843
<i>Huh?</i>

59:55.179 --> 59:58.615
<i>What's all of that? One of you guys
gotta speak English. Talk to me!</i>

1:00:02.653 --> 1:00:04.922
<i>Fuck!</i>

1:00:04.955 --> 1:00:06.523
<i>Come on, man! Come on!</i>

1:00:06.557 --> 1:00:08.892
No.

1:00:08.926 --> 1:00:11.462
<i>Just chill...
The fuck you gonna do with that?</i>

1:00:11.495 --> 1:00:13.063
No, no, no!

1:00:14.698 --> 1:00:17.267
<i>Please stop!</i>

1:00:23.107 --> 1:00:24.108
No.

1:00:24.141 --> 1:00:25.209
<i>Fuck you!</i>

1:00:26.577 --> 1:00:27.644
<i>My fuckin' eye!</i>

1:00:33.217 --> 1:00:36.153
<i>Now, come on.
Come on, come on.</i>

1:00:36.687 --> 1:00:38.188
<i>Please stop!</i>

1:01:03.247 --> 1:01:04.314
Goddamn it!

1:01:12.022 --> 1:01:13.090
Oh, shit.

1:01:49.126 --> 1:01:50.160
Ow!

1:02:54.458 --> 1:02:55.659
What do you want?

1:02:57.762 --> 1:02:59.129
Dash.

1:03:01.866 --> 1:03:04.201
What? What the fuck?
What are you talking...?

1:03:04.234 --> 1:03:06.303
And you,
been chosen.

1:03:06.336 --> 1:03:08.305
What if... what if we
talk about this, man?

1:03:08.338 --> 1:03:10.073
What if I could do
something?

1:03:10.107 --> 1:03:12.309
- Like you...
- You know I have a lot of...

1:03:12.342 --> 1:03:14.411
...you have audience,
I have audience.

1:03:14.444 --> 1:03:16.179
OK.

1:03:16.213 --> 1:03:20.083
Mine is just a little
more selective than yours.

1:03:20.117 --> 1:03:22.452
We can talk about this.
You don't have to fuckin' do this.

1:03:23.720 --> 1:03:25.188
What the fuck
are you doing?

1:03:26.891 --> 1:03:29.726
You know how much they pay
for an American?

1:03:30.862 --> 1:03:34.131
Huh? They love to watch.

1:03:54.184 --> 1:03:55.419
You have any preferences?

1:03:55.452 --> 1:03:56.553
Fuck you!

1:03:58.155 --> 1:03:59.222
Fuck you!

1:04:07.197 --> 1:04:08.265
They've chosen.

1:04:30.454 --> 1:04:31.856
Still alive?

1:04:33.791 --> 1:04:35.325
Final words?

1:04:38.830 --> 1:04:42.265
I can't help it.
I enjoy this.

1:06:45.923 --> 1:06:48.492
Fuck.

1:06:48.525 --> 1:06:49.961
Oh, my God.

1:07:02.439 --> 1:07:03.573
Mister Cole, I'm so glad
you found...

1:07:03.607 --> 1:07:05.308
You!

1:07:05.342 --> 1:07:06.878
What the fuck is this?

1:07:06.911 --> 1:07:08.012
No! Please,
no, no, no, no.

1:07:08.045 --> 1:07:09.781
I have been trying to help you.

1:07:09.814 --> 1:07:11.414
Help me? You're the fucking
driver. What is this?

1:07:11.448 --> 1:07:13.550
Listen to me!

1:07:13.583 --> 1:07:17.088
I couldn't say nothing earlier
because <i>he</i> is always watching.

1:07:17.121 --> 1:07:18.588
Who? Who is always watching?

1:07:18.622 --> 1:07:20.925
There's no time. Please.
You need to go.

1:07:20.958 --> 1:07:22.492
Please! You need to go,
right now!

1:07:22.526 --> 1:07:25.395
Go where? What the fuck?
What about my friends?

1:07:25.428 --> 1:07:26.898
There is no help
for your friends.

1:07:26.931 --> 1:07:29.533
You have the chance to escape.
Take my car.

1:07:29.566 --> 1:07:31.068
Please, go.
They are coming!

1:07:31.102 --> 1:07:35.572
- Who's coming?
- They are coming! Go!

1:07:35.605 --> 1:07:36.974
Why are you helping me?

1:07:37.008 --> 1:07:37.942
Hide!

1:09:11.202 --> 1:09:13.004
Thomas.
Holy shit. You're alive.

1:09:13.037 --> 1:09:14.171
Cole?

1:09:14.205 --> 1:09:16.774
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1:09:26.250 --> 1:09:27.885
You OK?

1:09:27.919 --> 1:09:30.087
- I'm so glad you're here.
- What did they do to you?

1:09:30.121 --> 1:09:32.223
Oh, your face.

1:09:32.256 --> 1:09:34.457
I can't see shit, Cole.

1:09:34.491 --> 1:09:36.626
Wait, wait.
Can you walk?

1:09:36.660 --> 1:09:38.728
Yeah, yeah. OK.

1:09:50.707 --> 1:09:53.710
Go, go over here.
Go, go, go!

1:09:53.743 --> 1:09:54.812
Go, go, go, go!

1:09:58.149 --> 1:09:59.850
Cole, Cole, Cole.
I can't see.

1:09:59.884 --> 1:10:01.886
Oh, yeah, OK.

1:10:14.631 --> 1:10:15.699
Shh.

1:11:36.881 --> 1:11:40.217
Sorry.

1:11:40.251 --> 1:11:43.187
Oh, my God.
What are they doing to us?

1:11:43.220 --> 1:11:45.790
Torturing us.

1:11:45.823 --> 1:11:47.825
People are paying to watch.

1:11:47.858 --> 1:11:50.027
Sam and Dash are...

1:11:52.629 --> 1:11:54.765
Sam and Dash are what?

1:11:58.269 --> 1:11:59.702
They're gone.

1:11:59.736 --> 1:12:01.839
I couldn't do anything,
Thomas.

1:12:01.872 --> 1:12:05.342
They died right
in front of me.

1:12:07.378 --> 1:12:10.181
Have you seen Erin?

1:12:10.214 --> 1:12:11.348
No.

1:12:15.386 --> 1:12:18.956
How do you get these
things off?

1:12:18.989 --> 1:12:21.358
They took mine off.
I was put in rusty handcuffs.

1:12:21.392 --> 1:12:24.028
Broke mine off when
I pulled this.

1:12:26.030 --> 1:12:27.865
OK, wait, stay here.
I'm gonna find something to break those.

1:12:27.898 --> 1:12:28.966
Yeah.

1:12:36.407 --> 1:12:38.943
Shh!

1:13:09.306 --> 1:13:10.774
Well, where the hell
do you think it goes?

1:13:10.808 --> 1:13:12.076
I don't know.

1:13:13.110 --> 1:13:15.279
I'll guide you.
Just trust me.

1:13:52.049 --> 1:13:55.352
All right, let's go.

1:13:58.956 --> 1:14:01.392
- Up here.
- Where are we going?

1:14:20.444 --> 1:14:23.746
I'll help you up.

1:14:31.021 --> 1:14:33.123
OK, OK. Stay here.

1:14:47.504 --> 1:14:50.007
Someone's coming.
Someone's coming.

1:14:52.509 --> 1:14:53.944
Come on, Thomas.

1:14:55.179 --> 1:14:56.547
OK, OK.

1:14:56.580 --> 1:14:58.015
There's gotta be some way
out of here.

1:15:00.985 --> 1:15:02.019
What do we do?

1:15:02.052 --> 1:15:03.087
Can we turn
this on?

1:15:11.929 --> 1:15:13.497
Fuck!

1:15:18.135 --> 1:15:19.937
Cole!

1:16:24.668 --> 1:16:25.903
Oh, fuck.

1:17:31.001 --> 1:17:32.903
Hey!

1:19:17.741 --> 1:19:18.709
Erin?

1:19:46.370 --> 1:19:47.704
Stop! Stop!

1:19:50.340 --> 1:19:51.308
No further.

1:19:52.709 --> 1:19:54.211
No further.

1:19:54.244 --> 1:19:55.847
Let her go or I'll
fucking shoot you.

1:19:55.880 --> 1:20:00.317
I don't think so.
One more move and I kill her.

1:20:00.350 --> 1:20:01.451
Please let her go.

1:20:01.485 --> 1:20:03.755
I will do whatever you want.

1:20:03.788 --> 1:20:06.089
We... we didn't do
anything to you.

1:20:06.123 --> 1:20:07.691
Please let her go.

1:20:07.724 --> 1:20:09.794
My men will come rushing
through the door any second.

1:20:09.827 --> 1:20:15.132
No!

1:20:15.165 --> 1:20:18.302
I'm so sorry.
What the fuck is this?

1:20:20.437 --> 1:20:23.674
What the fuck are you doing?

1:20:23.707 --> 1:20:25.843
What do you want?
Do you want money?

1:20:25.877 --> 1:20:28.278
I will give you... I'll pay you.
I'll give you all my money.

1:20:28.312 --> 1:20:30.147
Please, please, let her go.

1:20:34.184 --> 1:20:35.853
They pay me more.

1:20:41.425 --> 1:20:42.860
You think you're fast
enough?

1:20:44.361 --> 1:20:45.729
Huh?

1:20:48.332 --> 1:20:50.133
Cole...

1:20:51.735 --> 1:20:53.270
Do it!

1:20:54.538 --> 1:20:57.775
Oy.

1:20:57.809 --> 1:21:00.744
Do it!

1:21:11.823 --> 1:21:12.857
I love you.

1:21:37.280 --> 1:21:38.883
Wait!

1:22:02.874 --> 1:22:05.208
Erin!

1:22:06.309 --> 1:22:08.445
No, no, no!

1:22:36.908 --> 1:22:38.608
Oh, my God.

1:22:56.660 --> 1:22:57.694
Fuck!

1:23:24.688 --> 1:23:26.057
Cole...

1:23:28.625 --> 1:23:31.394
How does it feel
to lose everything, huh?

1:23:31.428 --> 1:23:33.497
Motherfucker!

1:23:33.530 --> 1:23:37.001
Come on.
Hey, hey, hey, Cole.

1:23:37.034 --> 1:23:38.635
How could you
do that to them?

1:23:38.668 --> 1:23:40.504
- Hey, hey, Cole, please!
- Fuck you!

1:23:40.537 --> 1:23:41.873
Let me explain!

1:23:41.906 --> 1:23:44.942
Fuckin' piece of...
I'll kill you!

1:23:44.976 --> 1:23:47.044
I'll fuckin' kill you!

1:23:47.078 --> 1:23:48.645
Fuckin' piece of shit.

1:23:48.678 --> 1:23:51.581
We trusted you,
you motherfucker!

1:23:51.615 --> 1:23:53.951
It's not real!
They're all... they're all...

1:24:27.651 --> 1:24:29.486
<i>So in three
months, my friends and I</i>

1:24:29.519 --> 1:24:31.555
<i>are gonna be doing
something special.</i>

1:24:31.588 --> 1:24:33.991
<i>They promised me it's gonna be
amazing.</i>

1:24:34.025 --> 1:24:35.692
<i>Thank you all so much
for watching,</i>

1:24:35.725 --> 1:24:39.462
<i>for voting, and for following.</i>

1:24:39.496 --> 1:24:42.499
<i>Yeah, we got drinks,
motherfucker!</i>

1:24:44.434 --> 1:24:46.703
<i>Every experience
is tailored to the player.</i>

1:24:46.736 --> 1:24:47.905
Oh, my God.

1:24:53.978 --> 1:24:56.680
Oh, my...

1:24:56.713 --> 1:24:59.083
<i>I need
to have you back by eight!</i>

1:25:01.118 --> 1:25:02.385
<i>This is yours.</i>

1:25:05.122 --> 1:25:07.959
<i>That's enough!
Stop the game! We can't get her out!</i>

1:25:07.992 --> 1:25:09.526
Oh, my God.

1:25:09.559 --> 1:25:11.528
<i>Where are you!</i>

1:25:12.063 --> 1:25:15.432
<i>Help! Fuck!</i>

1:25:36.087 --> 1:25:39.757
<i>Erin, Samantha, Dash.
We're taking you...</i>

1:25:39.790 --> 1:25:41.458
<i>So sick!</i>

1:25:44.095 --> 1:25:45.796
<i>Ah!</i>

1:25:50.667 --> 1:25:53.536
What the fuck?

1:26:12.656 --> 1:26:15.126
Hey, babe.
Where are you?

1:26:15.159 --> 1:26:16.660
Oh, great, you're almost here.

1:26:16.693 --> 1:26:18.095
We'll see you
in a second. Bye.

1:26:18.129 --> 1:26:19.629
He just pulled
in the driveway.

1:26:22.767 --> 1:26:24.035
You want anything?

1:26:24.068 --> 1:26:25.535
No, I'm good.

1:26:25.568 --> 1:26:27.637
FaceTime Thomas.

1:26:27.671 --> 1:26:29.106
- <i>Hey, what up, Dash?</i>
- All right, so he still doesn't know.

1:26:29.140 --> 1:26:31.641
So just tell everybody to keep
it on the low.

1:26:31.675 --> 1:26:33.210
<i>Dude, this is gonna be crazy.
He's not gonna even see it coming.</i>

1:26:33.244 --> 1:26:34.845
When's the last time you
guys even seen each other?

1:26:34.879 --> 1:26:36.479
<i>Must've been some years, bro.</i>

1:26:36.513 --> 1:26:38.115
OK, I'm gonna have to
let you go. He's coming.

1:26:38.149 --> 1:26:39.716
<i>OK, sounds good.
I'll see you soon.</i>

1:26:39.749 --> 1:26:40.851
All right, see you, bud.

1:26:44.288 --> 1:26:46.824
What's up, guys? Dash here.
And check this out.

1:26:46.857 --> 1:26:48.491
- We just picked up Thomas!
- Hey!

1:26:48.525 --> 1:26:50.094
He still has no idea.

1:26:50.127 --> 1:26:51.661
We got Alexei.

1:26:51.695 --> 1:26:53.530
<i>Hey. See you soon.</i>

1:26:57.201 --> 1:26:58.836
It'll be so crazy.
Oh, my gosh.

1:26:58.869 --> 1:27:02.139
I can't believe he
just has no idea.

1:27:02.173 --> 1:27:03.740
- You don't think he does?
- What's up?

1:27:06.643 --> 1:27:08.212
He's gonna know
that this is fake.

1:27:08.245 --> 1:27:10.815
He won't, trust me.
I'm taking care of everything.

1:27:12.917 --> 1:27:15.119
Aren't we worried
this isn't too much?

1:27:15.152 --> 1:27:17.755
He's always looking for
something to actually scare him, right?

1:27:17.788 --> 1:27:19.757
If we pull this off,
this is it.

1:27:20.925 --> 1:27:23.294
<i>There's no turning back now.
Remember, dude. We love you.</i>

1:27:23.327 --> 1:27:25.229
This is crazy even for you.

1:27:25.262 --> 1:27:26.897
You'll love it, bro.

1:27:26.931 --> 1:27:28.165
- All right, man, good luck.
- Peace.

1:27:28.199 --> 1:27:29.233
Peace.
