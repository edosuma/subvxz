00:39.497 --> 00:42.292
<i>Some places feel like
they're right out of a dream.</i>

00:44.252 --> 00:46.755
<i>Larkinville is one of those places.</i>

00:47.922 --> 00:53.178
<i>The people here are just a little
friendlier, the pace a little slower.</i>

00:54.471 --> 00:57.432
<i>Yeah, Larkinville's pretty great.</i>

00:57.515 --> 01:02.771
<i>Matter of fact, there's only
one problem in the whole town.</i>

01:06.024 --> 01:08.610
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I, I didn't see you there.

01:08.693 --> 01:10.528
Well, it's okay, Trevor.

01:10.612 --> 01:12.280
I'm sure it was an accident.

01:12.363 --> 01:13.865
Oh, it definitely was.

01:13.948 --> 01:15.408
I'll see you tomorrow!

01:15.492 --> 01:17.327
Yeah, I'm sure you will.

01:27.712 --> 01:29.714
-Sorry, Trevor.

01:29.798 --> 01:30.924
My bad.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.409
Oh, do you want this?

01:58.493 --> 02:00.829
You want this? You want this?

02:00.912 --> 02:02.664
Too bad, stupid.

02:09.587 --> 02:12.132
<i>Larkinville was a dream, all right.</i>

02:12.632 --> 02:14.134
<i>For Trevor Larkin.</i>

02:15.135 --> 02:19.055
<i>For just about everybody else,
it was a nightmare.</i>

02:22.600 --> 02:23.810
He's here.

02:45.915 --> 02:47.876
Look at you!

02:47.959 --> 02:49.919
You work out?
'Cause you're looking mad jacked.

02:50.003 --> 02:50.920
And that hair!

02:51.004 --> 02:52.714
You got it done fresh, didn't you?

02:52.797 --> 02:54.132
Let me see it from the side.

02:54.215 --> 02:56.176
Oh, okay. From the back.

02:56.259 --> 02:57.802
Looks tight.

03:01.055 --> 03:02.265
Well?

03:02.348 --> 03:05.768
Your essay on <i>Animal Farm</i>, your algebra
worksheet, and your Civil War diorama.

03:06.936 --> 03:08.646
We would've had
your chemistry project,

03:08.730 --> 03:10.732
but I got some ratios wrong
while I was mixing liquids.

03:10.815 --> 03:11.941
-There was a fire.
-A big one.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.151
-We'll have it tomorrow.
-At the latest.

03:13.234 --> 03:14.736
Hey! Hey, he looked at you.

03:15.695 --> 03:17.655
What? No, I didn't.

03:18.907 --> 03:20.950
No, I didn't. I swear I didn't.

03:21.576 --> 03:22.785
Were you looking at my scar?

03:22.869 --> 03:25.038
-No, no, I swear, I wasn't. I promise.
-He was. I saw him!

03:29.292 --> 03:30.668
Two for flinching.

03:32.712 --> 03:34.255
"Two for flinching."

03:34.339 --> 03:35.548
Classic.

03:52.815 --> 03:54.275
All right. I... I surrender.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.410
I want him gone.

04:04.494 --> 04:06.496
I don't care who his father is.

04:06.579 --> 04:10.250
That maniac bloodied my son's nose,
and I want him expelled!

04:10.333 --> 04:12.460
-Janice.
-I mean it! Today!

04:14.295 --> 04:16.256
We're sitting in the Larkinville Academy.

04:16.339 --> 04:19.300
A school made possible
by a grant from the Larkin Institute.

04:19.801 --> 04:22.095
I can't expel Trevor Larkin.

04:22.178 --> 04:23.429
Then bring him in here.

04:23.513 --> 04:25.139
So that I can tell him off to his face.

04:26.182 --> 04:28.476
Janice, don't you work
for Larkin Industries?

04:28.559 --> 04:29.686
Let them fire me!

04:29.769 --> 04:30.937
I don't care.

04:31.020 --> 04:33.064
My son is more important.

04:33.147 --> 04:36.526
Rick Larkin won't just fire you.

04:36.609 --> 04:38.945
He owns the apartment complex you live in.

04:39.028 --> 04:40.571
He'll toss you out on the street

04:40.655 --> 04:43.449
for even suggesting
his precious son did something wrong.

04:43.533 --> 04:47.412
And then he'll fire me for having
the audacity to hear you suggest it.

04:47.495 --> 04:49.622
And then, he'll pull all our funding,

04:49.706 --> 04:52.542
and 50 teachers and administrators
will be out of a job,

04:52.625 --> 04:55.086
and your son's nose
won't be any less bloodied.

04:55.670 --> 04:57.046
Forget it, Jan.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.631
It's Larkinville.

05:00.091 --> 05:02.760
According to the laws of economics,

05:02.844 --> 05:06.389
the shorter the supply,
the more valuable something becomes.

05:07.348 --> 05:09.309
MR.
Can anyone give me an example

05:09.392 --> 05:11.602
of something that gets its value

05:11.686 --> 05:13.396
-from being in short supply?

05:15.106 --> 05:18.359
Trevor, you have something to contribute.

05:19.068 --> 05:20.153
I do.

05:20.611 --> 05:21.696
Jobs.

05:22.363 --> 05:26.326
See, my dad says the only good jobs
in Larkinville are because of him.

05:26.909 --> 05:28.578
He says, if he wanted,

05:29.078 --> 05:33.875
he can make this whole town turn to dust
with the snap of his fingers.

05:34.792 --> 05:36.127
He's basically Thanos.

05:36.210 --> 05:38.504
Well, I can't argue with that.

05:38.588 --> 05:39.839
Um...

05:39.922 --> 05:41.257
Excuse me.

05:44.719 --> 05:48.139
Sorry, they told me to come here. I'm new.

05:48.681 --> 05:50.183
<i>Oh, bliss.</i>

05:51.059 --> 05:53.186
<i>Sweet bully bliss.</i>

05:53.728 --> 05:55.438
<i>Trevor's senses were overwhelmed.</i>

05:55.521 --> 05:56.689
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

05:56.773 --> 05:59.317
<i>His mind already conjuring insults.</i>

05:59.400 --> 06:00.318
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

06:00.401 --> 06:02.570
Sure, have a seat, Mr...

06:02.653 --> 06:04.655
Burger. Evan Burger.

06:04.739 --> 06:05.782
Burger?

06:05.865 --> 06:10.036
I'm sorry, did he just say
that his last name... is Burger?

06:11.704 --> 06:14.040
Oh, my God. Do you come with fries?

06:14.123 --> 06:16.000
Is your middle name Cheese?

06:19.754 --> 06:21.214
Burger.

06:28.137 --> 06:29.764
-We don't have long.
-What are you doing?

06:29.847 --> 06:31.307
-We're here to warn you.
-Warn me?

06:31.391 --> 06:32.975
-The laughing kid?
-Curly hair?

06:33.059 --> 06:34.435
-Size of a kaiju?
-What about him?

06:34.519 --> 06:36.270
His name is Trevor Larkin,
and he's coming for you.

06:36.354 --> 06:37.897
-Why?
-Why does the lion hunt the gazelle?

06:37.980 --> 06:40.900
-Because it's Larkinville.
-Everyone's a target in Larkinville.

06:40.983 --> 06:41.859
You're a bull's eye, kid.

06:41.943 --> 06:43.861
And that means it's only a matter of time.

06:43.945 --> 06:46.489
Our advice, do what he says.
It's easier that way.

06:47.281 --> 06:48.408
Welcome to the Resistance.

07:03.089 --> 07:04.590
Empty your backpack.

07:05.425 --> 07:06.676
Excuse me?

07:06.759 --> 07:09.262
He said, "Empty your backpack."

07:11.305 --> 07:12.306
Why?

07:12.390 --> 07:13.724
Nobody told this kid?

07:17.478 --> 07:18.813
What did you say?

07:18.896 --> 07:20.273
I said, "Why?"

07:21.899 --> 07:23.568
Because I said so.

07:25.319 --> 07:26.446
No.

07:33.369 --> 07:35.121
-He's a dead man.
-We didn't try hard enough.

07:35.329 --> 07:36.622
I blame myself.

07:41.669 --> 07:42.920
Do it...

07:43.004 --> 07:48.593
or you'll catch the beating
of your pathetic little life.

07:49.802 --> 07:51.429
That would be a mistake.

08:03.274 --> 08:04.942
You brought this on yourself.

08:09.071 --> 08:11.073
<i>You're dead! Yes!</i>

08:11.157 --> 08:14.660
Ooh, can we get a triple?
Let's do it! Dead!

08:14.744 --> 08:16.370
<i>Stop spawn camping, you cheater!</i>

08:16.454 --> 08:18.456
Stop dying, you loser.

08:19.248 --> 08:20.708
-Yes!

08:20.791 --> 08:23.002
Oh, come on, let me get that diamond.

08:23.085 --> 08:25.004
Where are you going? You're dead.

08:26.047 --> 08:28.299
Hey, is somebody gonna get that?

08:33.971 --> 08:35.181
Seriously?

08:39.227 --> 08:40.603
The heck?

08:42.271 --> 08:43.481
What do you...

08:44.065 --> 08:46.317
Did you do this to my grandson?

08:47.735 --> 08:49.820
How did you find my house?

08:49.904 --> 08:51.864
Did you do this to him?

08:52.657 --> 08:54.784
Get out of here, or I'll call the cops!

08:54.867 --> 08:56.744
Ask his forgiveness.

08:56.827 --> 08:58.037
Oh. Yeah.

08:58.120 --> 09:00.039
Um, do you know who my dad is?

09:00.122 --> 09:02.166
Ask his forgiveness!

09:02.250 --> 09:04.418
My dad is Rick Larkin.

09:04.502 --> 09:06.128
I will not say it again.

09:06.212 --> 09:07.672
Ask his forgiveness!

09:07.755 --> 09:10.383
Get off my property.

09:10.758 --> 09:13.427
Or something bad will happen to you, too.

09:17.348 --> 09:19.433
And I'll see you at school tomorrow.

09:23.145 --> 09:24.397
Hey!

09:33.864 --> 09:38.786
<i>For the first time in his life,
Trevor Larkin was afraid.</i>

09:43.583 --> 09:45.876
<i>As for the rest of Larkinville, well...</i>

09:46.669 --> 09:49.088
<i>people weren't quite sure what they felt.</i>

09:50.506 --> 09:53.509
<i>It was like the wind
had come out of nowhere</i>

09:53.593 --> 09:55.720
<i>and brought something new with it.</i>

09:57.972 --> 09:59.682
<i>They couldn't quite place it...</i>

10:00.683 --> 10:02.560
<i>but they knew it was different.</i>

10:28.794 --> 10:30.212
I tried to warn you.

10:39.972 --> 10:42.725
<i>She's talking to me?
About dodgeball?</i>

10:42.808 --> 10:44.393
Oh, I couldn't believe it.

10:44.727 --> 10:49.857
She had the nerve to barge into my office,
tell me my son is a menace?

10:49.940 --> 10:51.192
I nearly blew my top.

10:51.275 --> 10:53.944
-It was an accident, Dad.
-Of course, it was.

10:54.028 --> 10:56.197
You should have seen the way
I screamed at her.

10:56.781 --> 11:00.201
Is it wrong that
I kinda feel bad for the kid?

11:00.785 --> 11:03.663
No, babe, you're made of sugar.

11:03.746 --> 11:04.955
You can't help, but be sweet.

11:06.332 --> 11:08.709
Um, you'll mess my lipstick.

11:10.378 --> 11:13.547
So, should we send a card or something?

11:13.631 --> 11:15.383
Well, don't send it to their apartment.

11:15.466 --> 11:16.676
I had the locks changed.

11:16.759 --> 11:18.719
She had her furniture
dumped on the curb.

11:18.803 --> 11:19.720
I mean, the nerve!

11:19.804 --> 11:21.681
Her son's nose was bleeding.

11:21.764 --> 11:24.266
Oh, for the love... It's dodgeball.

11:24.350 --> 11:27.019
You take a ball,
you throw it at the other kid.

11:27.103 --> 11:30.356
It's not his fault the twerp
didn't have his hands up in time.

11:30.439 --> 11:33.109
I know, Daddy.

11:34.318 --> 11:37.321
I know you know, Mommy.

11:41.575 --> 11:42.618
Mm-mm.

11:42.702 --> 11:43.994
Mm-mm.

11:46.664 --> 11:52.420
All I'm saying is that
maybe Trevor shouldn't be so, um...

11:53.337 --> 11:55.256
aggressive.

11:59.301 --> 12:01.220
You want him to be less aggressive?

12:02.346 --> 12:03.514
Uh-huh.

12:03.597 --> 12:06.767
Okay, tell her what being
less aggressive gets you.

12:07.685 --> 12:08.978
Trampled on.

12:09.061 --> 12:10.479
Trampled, Kendra.

12:10.563 --> 12:14.900
In this life, you're either wearing
the boot or you're under it.

12:18.529 --> 12:20.406
-- <i>Are you good?</i>
-- <i>Uh-huh.</i>

12:20.990 --> 12:23.033
<i>My leg!</i>

13:26.305 --> 13:28.098
No. No!

13:31.101 --> 13:32.770
-Trevor, you all right, son?

13:36.732 --> 13:38.192
I'm fi...

13:38.692 --> 13:39.819
...fine.

13:39.902 --> 13:42.822
I'm just... sick.

13:42.905 --> 13:44.490
Let me take
your temperature, sweetie.

13:44.573 --> 13:45.991
I said I'm fine.

13:47.117 --> 13:49.829
<i>Trevor was a long way from fine.</i>

13:50.704 --> 13:53.457
<i>And he had a hunch as to why.</i>

13:53.624 --> 13:58.170
Ask his forgiveness.

14:18.107 --> 14:19.567
Hey!

14:19.650 --> 14:22.695
No, it really was an accident this time.

14:26.115 --> 14:27.533
You?

14:27.616 --> 14:28.784
Let me go!

14:28.868 --> 14:30.452
You know how many times
I prayed about this?

14:30.536 --> 14:31.453
Let go of me!

14:31.537 --> 14:33.414
All the little flowers
that you have stomped on.

14:33.497 --> 14:35.583
I prayed that someday,

14:35.666 --> 14:38.544
-somebody was gonna stomp on you!
-Let go of me!

14:38.627 --> 14:40.212
Come back here!

14:41.463 --> 14:43.299
Watch out, you little jerk.

14:44.758 --> 14:48.220
Please. Please, you've gotta help me.

14:48.304 --> 14:50.347
-She's after me.
-Don't I know you?

14:50.431 --> 14:52.057
Oh, you know him, all right.

14:52.725 --> 14:55.352
He has been making your life
miserable for years.

14:56.478 --> 14:59.231
It's him, it's Trevor Larkin.

14:59.315 --> 15:00.649
-No.
-Uh-huh.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.902
-That's impossible.
-I think she's right.

15:02.985 --> 15:04.778
Looks like somebody stuck him
in the dryer on high heat.

15:04.862 --> 15:07.239
-But how?
-Who cares how?

15:07.865 --> 15:10.534
I don't know,
he's still Rick Larkin's kid.

15:11.201 --> 15:14.622
-<i>He was still Rick Larkin's kid.</i>

15:14.705 --> 15:17.374
<i>But somehow it felt different.</i>

15:20.210 --> 15:21.795
Yeah, but I don't care.

15:25.090 --> 15:26.216
Get him!

16:03.587 --> 16:05.756
-Hey, have you seen Evan Burger?

16:05.839 --> 16:07.549
You, have you seen Evan Burger?

16:08.634 --> 16:10.719
Have you seen Evan Burger?

16:11.845 --> 16:13.347
Please someone...

16:13.430 --> 16:15.224
You! Have you seen Evan Burger?

16:15.849 --> 16:17.810
Please, has anybody seen
the new kid, Evan?

16:18.227 --> 16:20.604
Hey, you. Have you... Oh.

16:20.688 --> 16:22.231
It's Trevor Larkin.

16:23.524 --> 16:25.192
What? No, I don't know
what you're talking about.

16:25.275 --> 16:26.235
It's Trevor Larkin!

16:26.318 --> 16:28.570
-Trevor?
-You smashed my nose.

16:28.654 --> 16:30.155
You got my mom fired.

16:30.239 --> 16:31.615
You got us evicted!

16:33.784 --> 16:34.910
Whoa, stop.

16:36.078 --> 16:38.038
-You humiliated me.

16:38.122 --> 16:39.707
You hung me over a toilet.

16:39.832 --> 16:43.293
-Two for flinching, Trevor.
-No more putting up with insults.

16:43.377 --> 16:44.712
No more being afraid.

16:44.837 --> 16:47.297
Let's see if you like how it feels.

16:47.381 --> 16:49.299
-Yeah, get him.
-Get him, now!

16:49.383 --> 16:50.300
Help!

16:50.384 --> 16:52.594
-Somebody help me!
-Stop!

16:57.141 --> 16:58.475
He deserves it.

16:58.559 --> 17:01.603
We do this,
and we're just as bad as he is.

17:09.361 --> 17:10.404
Thanks.

17:16.160 --> 17:17.661
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

17:17.745 --> 17:20.748
I promise I'll never make fun of anybody,

17:20.831 --> 17:24.918
or pick on anybody
or hurt anybody ever again, I swear.

17:28.505 --> 17:29.631
I'm so sorry.

17:34.928 --> 17:36.388
Please forgive me.

17:36.472 --> 17:39.892
Please, just make me big again.

17:44.980 --> 17:45.898
Up.

17:46.899 --> 17:47.858
Up.

17:51.528 --> 17:55.074
The things we do to others,
we do to ourselves.

17:55.908 --> 17:59.036
Love others and you love yourself.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.830
-Hurt others...
-Yes.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.749
Yes, I understand.

18:30.734 --> 18:35.739
When you wake up in the morning,
the world will be as it should.

18:37.324 --> 18:39.118
Thank you! Thank you!

18:39.201 --> 18:41.328
I promise I'll never forget.

18:41.411 --> 18:43.247
I'll never forget it, I swear.

18:43.914 --> 18:45.791
I know you won't.

18:55.968 --> 18:59.179
<i>That night felt like Christmas Eve.</i>

18:59.263 --> 19:05.269
<i>Trevor could hardly wait till morning
when the world would be as it should be.</i>

19:05.352 --> 19:07.771
<i>Just like the old woman promised.</i>

19:08.438 --> 19:13.360
<i>He'd been given something priceless,
a chance at a new life.</i>

19:14.570 --> 19:17.614
<i>The only thing left to do was live it.</i>

19:32.045 --> 19:33.547
Payback time.

19:55.736 --> 19:57.279
Oops, my bad.

19:58.197 --> 19:59.364
Trevor.

20:02.367 --> 20:04.369
What did you do that for, son?

20:05.996 --> 20:09.416
Dad. Dad, why are you working?

20:09.833 --> 20:11.168
What do you mean?

20:11.251 --> 20:13.587
I work for the Burger family.

20:15.631 --> 20:16.882
We all do.

20:17.466 --> 20:18.592
What?

20:37.945 --> 20:39.112
Come on.

20:40.364 --> 20:41.531
Take your gloves.

20:42.115 --> 20:43.575
We got a long day ahead of us.

20:47.788 --> 20:50.290
No!

20:50.374 --> 20:52.292
<i>It's said Trevor's scream could be heard</i>

20:52.376 --> 20:54.670
<i>clear across three counties that day.</i>

20:57.297 --> 21:00.884
<i>Carried on the same wind
that had swept away a town ruled by fear.</i>

21:04.137 --> 21:07.266
<i>And left something better
growing in its wake.</i>

21:12.271 --> 21:14.481
<i>Yeah, Burgerville is pretty great.</i>

21:15.482 --> 21:17.859
<i>The people here
are just a little friendlier.</i>

21:18.485 --> 21:20.654
<i>The pace a little slower.</i>

21:21.571 --> 21:25.492
<i>Some places feel like
they're right out of a dream.</i>
