- Tarragon, God damn it.

39:44.512 --> 39:47.036
- What now?
- Tarragon. It's an herb.

39:48.777 --> 39:50.170
Felicity loved it.

39:50.213 --> 39:51.780
Dumped it on just
about everything.

39:51.824 --> 39:54.043
Chicken. Fish. White chili.
- Mm.

39:54.087 --> 39:56.176
- There's not a trace of it
in that apartment,

39:56.219 --> 39:58.047
same as there aren't any books,

39:58.091 --> 39:59.875
which is, by the way,

39:59.919 --> 40:01.486
what my sister
liked to read,

40:01.529 --> 40:03.009
two at a time,

40:03.052 --> 40:05.490
not magazines.

40:06.795 --> 40:08.928
- Books?
- Yeah, books.

40:08.971 --> 40:12.018
Felicity wasn't neat, Chief.

40:12.061 --> 40:14.194
She didn't hang Impressionist
prints on her wall

40:14.237 --> 40:15.891
like a fucking
depressed secretary.

40:15.935 --> 40:19.721
She didn't press and fold
her underwear.

40:19.765 --> 40:21.854
She left piles.

40:21.897 --> 40:23.551
Nests.

40:23.595 --> 40:26.859
- Miss Dill, you really need
to calm down.

40:26.902 --> 40:30.079
- No one lived
in that apartment.

40:30.123 --> 40:32.212
Certainly not my sister.

40:32.255 --> 40:34.519
- When was the last time
you saw Felicity?

40:37.130 --> 40:38.566
- Three years ago.

40:38.610 --> 40:40.220
She came to D.C.
for a few days.

40:40.263 --> 40:41.874
- The last time
you were here?

40:41.917 --> 40:43.745
- Nine years before that.

40:43.789 --> 40:45.921
- Doesn't sound like
you were particularly close.

40:45.965 --> 40:48.794
I say that because police work

40:48.837 --> 40:50.839
has a funny way
of changing people.

40:50.883 --> 40:54.452
Makes them a lot less sloppy
in all areas of their life.

41:00.545 --> 41:02.590
- Tell me where
my sister lived,

41:02.634 --> 41:08.074
or so help me God, I will burn
this city to the ground.

41:13.601 --> 41:15.821
- I believe you would, too.

41:18.127 --> 41:19.955
Okay, Miss Dill.

41:19.999 --> 41:22.610
Maybe your sister didn't live
at this address.

41:23.959 --> 41:25.700
At least not full-time.

41:25.744 --> 41:27.659
- Why?

41:30.313 --> 41:33.534
- Perhaps it wasn't safe.

41:33.578 --> 41:35.710
- What did she have
to be afraid of?

41:35.754 --> 41:37.930
- Everything.

41:37.973 --> 41:39.975
If you're smart
in this life,

41:40.019 --> 41:42.717
you'll be afraid
of everything.

Felicity that.

aren't you?

42:07.786 --> 42:09.309

42:09.352 --> 42:11.093

42:15.054 --> 42:16.708

42:27.936 --> 42:30.156
Where Felicity
actually lived.

42:31.940 --> 42:33.986
You know, I had an old
desk sergeant

42:34.029 --> 42:36.902
that used to say that
being a cop in Saint Disgrace

42:36.945 --> 42:40.340
was kind of like being a salad
on the menu at a burger joint.

it was more than that.
