00:04.123 --> 00:06.752
Police have identified
the body parts of a man

00:06.857 --> 00:10.136
found in six bags
in the Hastings River at Wauchope.

00:10.137 --> 00:11.077
Frank O'Rourke?

00:11.108 --> 00:13.387
I know who killed
Terry Falconer.

00:13.388 --> 00:16.267
Who's been talking?

00:16.268 --> 00:20.587
Tink'd never tell. It's not in
his - whatcha-me-call-it? - DNA.

00:20.588 --> 00:22.988
And what if he finds out
we knew but never said nothin'?

00:22.989 --> 00:26.307
Jeepers. You're scaring me.
You ought to be scared, eh?

00:26.308 --> 00:28.267
No, YOU. YOU'RE scaring me.

00:28.268 --> 00:30.627
Francis Xavier O'Rourke, aka Tink.

00:30.628 --> 00:32.747
Gary, you can't hang
an entire murder brief

00:32.747 --> 00:34.547
on one tattooed lunatic.

00:34.548 --> 00:35.987
He'll come around.

00:35.988 --> 00:37.706
- This is Anthony's number?
- Yeah.

00:37.707 --> 00:39.106
Didn't get the last three digits?

00:39.107 --> 00:40.748
I got the make and model
of the dog and bone.

00:40.749 --> 00:42.667
Hello?

00:42.668 --> 00:44.827
Sergeant Jubelin?
Technical Branch.

00:44.828 --> 00:48.348
We've identified the number.
Anthony Perish's mobile number?

00:51.588 --> 00:53.067
My strong advice?

00:53.068 --> 00:55.747
Concentrate on catching
Anthony John Michael Perish

00:55.748 --> 00:57.668
while you've still got
a strike force to do it.

00:57.669 --> 01:00.747
But you've got to sign
and date every page of that.

01:00.748 --> 01:03.068
You've gotta look Rooster
in the eye in court one day

01:03.069 --> 01:05.388
and you gotta tell the jury
what happened.

02:01.948 --> 02:06.227
Bless us, O Lord,
and these thy gifts

02:06.228 --> 02:09.987
which we are about to receive
from thy bounty.

02:09.988 --> 02:13.347
Through Christ our Lord, amen.

02:13.348 --> 02:15.867
Amen.

02:15.868 --> 02:18.428
Happy birthday, Mum.
Happy birthday, Mum.

02:19.988 --> 02:22.107
Lovely to see my family here.

02:22.108 --> 02:23.788
Not all of them.

02:27.148 --> 02:29.388
Hope he gave you the day off, Mum.

02:31.348 --> 02:33.027
Where's the birthday girl?

02:33.028 --> 02:35.267
Oh, I didn't expect
to see you, love.

02:35.268 --> 02:36.747
Many happies, Mum.

02:36.748 --> 02:40.308
Let me take them for you.

02:42.828 --> 02:44.827
G'day, Pop.

02:44.828 --> 02:47.587
Thought you were dead in a ditch.

02:47.588 --> 02:50.307
Hoped I was.

02:50.308 --> 02:52.427
What you been up to, Rooster?

02:52.428 --> 02:55.587
Oh, you know...
Seeing a man about a... dog.

02:55.588 --> 02:57.947
Did you shoot it?

02:57.948 --> 02:59.748
Made a car seat cover out of it.

03:01.348 --> 03:03.868
Heard a nasty rumour
about your mate - Frank.

03:05.068 --> 03:07.747
He's buggered off. Cleared out.

03:07.748 --> 03:11.067
Nobody knows where.
Who says?

03:11.068 --> 03:12.907
Why would he do that, eh?

03:12.908 --> 03:15.308
Well, who said it?
Muzz.

03:16.628 --> 03:20.228
Muzz doesn't know
whether his head's on.

03:21.748 --> 03:23.868
Why would a man do that?

03:27.868 --> 03:30.427
Look, I'll find him
and I'll... I'll sort it out.

03:30.428 --> 03:33.267
Only one reason I can think of -
he dogged me.

03:33.268 --> 03:35.627
That's bullshit.

03:35.628 --> 03:37.627
Dogged you too.
That's bullshit.

03:37.628 --> 03:39.348
Or he's thinking about it.

03:40.508 --> 03:42.987
Tink... Tink - he's not
that kind of...

03:42.988 --> 03:46.427
He wouldn't dog anyone.
He's... he's not that stupid.

03:46.428 --> 03:48.668
Yeah, well, maybe he is.

03:52.988 --> 03:55.788
Find him, Undies. Sort him out.

04:04.148 --> 04:06.988
Where is he living these days?

04:08.268 --> 04:11.107
You wouldn't tell me,
even if you knew.

04:11.108 --> 04:13.548
How would I know?
He never tells me a thing.

04:26.148 --> 04:28.027
Tink, you fuck...

04:28.028 --> 04:29.668
Fuckin' piece of shit.

04:34.388 --> 04:37.347
Fuckin' shit! Shit!

04:37.348 --> 04:41.667
Fuck! Shit! Shit! Shit!

04:41.668 --> 04:43.148
Fuck!

04:46.748 --> 04:48.906
Look, I know what you're gonna
say, and I am telling you,

04:48.907 --> 04:51.028
this is not the time
to pull the plug on Tuno, alright?

04:51.029 --> 04:53.068
Every instinct I've got
tells me we're close.

04:54.668 --> 04:57.147
I need your resources elsewhere.

04:57.148 --> 04:59.948
What f... resources?

05:02.468 --> 05:04.748
Alright, we can...
We can make an arrest tomorrow.

05:04.749 --> 05:06.307
Oh, Jesus, Gary!

05:06.308 --> 05:07.786
What do I tell the Falconer family?

05:07.787 --> 05:10.026
The same thing we always say -
the file stays open

05:10.027 --> 05:11.708
in the event
new evidence comes to light.

05:11.709 --> 05:14.747
And what - I just move on
to another murder of the week?

05:14.748 --> 05:18.668
No. That's the other news.

05:20.028 --> 05:22.187
I'm rotating you out of Homicide.

05:22.188 --> 05:23.468
What?

05:24.588 --> 05:26.148
You need a change of scene.

05:30.548 --> 05:32.228
I'm the corporate memory
of this place.

05:32.229 --> 05:34.707
Mate, 20 years in one job
is too long.

05:34.708 --> 05:37.108
What - you saying I'm stale?
You saying I'm lazy?

05:38.108 --> 05:40.787
What - you look at me and you see
Chook fuckin' Fowler, is that it?

05:40.788 --> 05:42.548
You're the hardest-working
copper in the building.

05:42.549 --> 05:44.267
Then why?!

05:44.268 --> 05:46.227
Because Homicide needs new blood

05:46.228 --> 05:49.428
and you need to expand
your horizons.

05:53.588 --> 05:56.147
So, just like that? That...

05:56.148 --> 05:58.267
You just...?

05:58.268 --> 06:00.548
Mate, you knew it was coming.

06:03.548 --> 06:06.347
Tuno's not exactly...
It's not exactly dead.

06:06.348 --> 06:08.387
It's, uh...
Unconscious?

06:08.388 --> 06:10.547
On life support?
Downsized?

06:10.548 --> 06:12.747
Brownie'll take carriage
of the Falconer matter

06:12.748 --> 06:15.347
while he's... he's doing other stuff.

06:15.348 --> 06:17.668
So, basically, he's
officer in charge of a briefcase?

06:17.669 --> 06:19.147
No, good work, Brownie.

06:19.148 --> 06:22.147
The rest of us will go off
and expand our skill sets.

06:22.148 --> 06:25.027
So, they've actually kicked you
out of Homicide? Why?

06:25.028 --> 06:27.267
The idea is to keep people fresh.

06:27.268 --> 06:30.507
It's just...
No, it's a good idea.

06:30.508 --> 06:32.507
It's come from the top,
so that's where we are.

06:32.508 --> 06:33.947
What's the role, Gary?

06:33.948 --> 06:36.107
It's crime manager at Chatswood.

06:36.108 --> 06:38.627
You know what? We should
all go for promotions.

06:38.628 --> 06:40.428
Might get ourselves some clout.

06:41.548 --> 06:43.587
Keep our heads down
till the dust settles,

06:43.588 --> 06:45.267
and then we'll get back together.

06:45.268 --> 06:47.748
Good plan.
Yeah, clever plan.

06:49.428 --> 06:50.907
That's it, guys.

06:50.908 --> 06:53.067
But in their heart of hearts

06:53.068 --> 06:55.028
they knew they were
kidding themselves.

06:55.029 --> 06:57.707
Strike Force Tuno
was a dead duck.

06:57.708 --> 07:02.307
But, of course, Anthony Perish
didn't know that... yet.

07:02.308 --> 07:04.187
As far as he was concerned,

07:04.188 --> 07:07.427
Gary Jubelin and a large team
of dedicated police officers

07:07.428 --> 07:10.587
were still coming after him,
all guns blazing.

07:10.588 --> 07:12.506
You want me to put
stainless-steel reinforcing

07:12.507 --> 07:14.346
in the front room -
is that what you said?

07:14.347 --> 07:16.228
Yeah, that'll be me bedroom.
Six mil.

07:16.229 --> 07:19.147
Are you expecting
heavy artillery fire?

07:19.148 --> 07:21.107
Why does it have to be stainless?

07:21.108 --> 07:22.787
Come on, Heidi. Tea time.

07:22.788 --> 07:24.307
Ooh, who's a good girl, eh?

07:24.308 --> 07:26.707
I like stainless steel.

07:26.708 --> 07:30.467
Here, you feed her.
Come on, get in there.

07:30.468 --> 07:32.467
She can't reach that far.

07:32.468 --> 07:34.388
Go on, matey.

07:35.388 --> 07:39.068
Don't be a dill, Muzz.
She'll rip your bloody arm off.

07:40.588 --> 07:42.067
Look, I know for a fact

07:42.068 --> 07:43.788
the Living Deadheads
have got grenade launchers

07:43.789 --> 07:45.467
'cause I supplied the fuckers,

07:45.468 --> 07:47.426
and their clubhouse
is two suburbs thataway.

07:47.427 --> 07:49.668
Look, I just don't want to wake up
dead one night, alright?

07:49.669 --> 07:51.708
You don't sleep anyway.

07:54.908 --> 07:57.187
Could do with a lick of paint.

07:57.188 --> 07:59.068
Don't be stupid. Leave it alone.

08:00.228 --> 08:02.227
It's my Wild West bolthole.

08:02.228 --> 08:03.908
Perfect for when I visit me folks.

08:05.268 --> 08:08.347
It's gonna take some organising -
steel plate that size.

08:08.348 --> 08:10.788
Yeah, well, you can earn
your money for once, eh?

08:10.789 --> 08:12.667
We need tradies we can trust.

08:12.668 --> 08:15.427
You don't have to tell 'em
it's for Australia's most wanted.

08:15.428 --> 08:18.868
Just say I'm a nut.
I wear tinfoil in me underpants.

08:22.708 --> 08:24.348
So, tell me something,
Muzzy Muzz.

08:26.228 --> 08:28.467
How come you knew
Tink had pissed off, eh?

08:28.468 --> 08:30.907
Oh, it was the, um...

08:30.908 --> 08:33.628
The guy at the, uh, servo
on Henry Lawson Drive.

08:39.668 --> 08:42.788
Only way to survive - assume
everyone you deal with is a dog.

08:45.868 --> 08:47.628
Everyone except you, eh?

09:03.228 --> 09:05.467
Boss? Uh, Gary.

09:05.468 --> 09:07.987
Sorry. Gary.

09:07.988 --> 09:09.708
Come in, Camille.

09:12.428 --> 09:14.227
I just wanted to say

09:14.228 --> 09:17.347
working with you and Tim Browne
and the boys,

09:17.348 --> 09:19.787
it's been the highlight
of my career.

09:19.788 --> 09:21.627
Thank you.

09:21.628 --> 09:23.427
No, thank you.

09:23.428 --> 09:25.308
We really appreciate
what you brought the team.

09:26.468 --> 09:28.787
You do?
We do.

09:28.788 --> 09:30.746
If by some miracle
Tuno happens to reboot,

09:30.747 --> 09:32.268
you'd be the first person
I'd call.

09:34.628 --> 09:36.108
Thank you, Camille.

09:49.468 --> 09:51.148
It's been good working
with you, Camille.

09:52.908 --> 09:56.068
I feel like I've been expelled.

10:04.708 --> 10:06.227
You know something?

10:06.228 --> 10:08.947
We're at the heart of the city,
population-wise.

10:08.948 --> 10:10.788
Just as many people
living to the west

10:10.789 --> 10:12.667
as there are to the east.

10:12.668 --> 10:14.827
You a westie, Brownie?

10:14.828 --> 10:16.787
Born and bred.

10:16.788 --> 10:18.428
Camille too.

10:19.628 --> 10:22.707
Frank O'Rourke, Terry Falconer,
the Perishes.

10:22.708 --> 10:25.667
How do you think Anthony got so big
without us even noticing?

10:25.668 --> 10:27.307
Oh, he'll make a mistake one day,

10:27.308 --> 10:28.788
and when he does,
we'll be there to nab him.

10:28.789 --> 10:30.788
We?

10:31.948 --> 10:33.707
Me and you, Brownie.

10:33.708 --> 10:36.108
We're not giving up on this bloke.

10:37.268 --> 10:40.148
So, this is where the big nobs
hang out - Bar Tuno.

10:41.628 --> 10:44.107
You're evil, Keogh.
Mm-hm. I'm quitting.

10:44.108 --> 10:47.508
You heard?
Yeah. Bummer.

10:49.628 --> 10:51.828
We've just gotta make sure
that Perish doesn't find out.

10:51.829 --> 10:55.107
We want him to think we're still
breathing down their necks.

10:55.108 --> 10:57.227
I can keep this vibe going
in the media

10:57.228 --> 10:59.468
as long as you guys feed me
the occasional titbit.

10:59.469 --> 11:01.748
We can do that.

11:02.828 --> 11:04.307
Tuno lives.

11:04.308 --> 11:06.427
Tuno lives.

11:06.428 --> 11:07.908
Cheers.

11:27.108 --> 11:29.067
The jacks have bugged me car!

11:29.068 --> 11:31.947
They got surveillance on me
24 fuckin' 7.

11:31.948 --> 11:34.067
I don't know how,
but every time I take a leak,

11:34.068 --> 11:35.948
there's a cop measuring
me fuckin' flow.

11:35.949 --> 11:38.067
Well, how do they know
it's your wheels?

11:38.068 --> 11:39.587
The rego papers don't say so.

11:39.588 --> 11:42.587
Frank 'The Dog' O'Rourke,
that's how.

11:42.588 --> 11:44.188
Anything?

11:45.548 --> 11:49.187
Oh, well, let's say we go for a
drive to celebrate? Grab a burger.

11:49.188 --> 11:51.028
Nah, we got work to do.

11:52.388 --> 11:54.587
I need a plasma cutter.

11:54.588 --> 11:58.148
Get me a plasma cutter!
You lazy bastard.

12:57.308 --> 13:00.027
Tim Browne
was now officer in charge of

13:00.028 --> 13:01.827
the Terry Falconer matter,

13:01.828 --> 13:04.027
but he didn't have much time
to dwell on it.

13:04.028 --> 13:07.987
He was up to his armpits
in other murders.

13:07.988 --> 13:10.147
Over the next couple of years,

13:10.148 --> 13:12.147
he served
on Strike Force Katina,

13:12.148 --> 13:15.747
investigating the murder of
underworld figure Franco Mayer,

13:15.748 --> 13:19.907
Strike Force Eade, dealing with
a triple killing in Albury,

13:19.908 --> 13:23.667
Strike Force Womboola,
Strike Force Broomwade

13:23.668 --> 13:25.347
and others.

13:25.348 --> 13:27.187
Gary Jubelin, on the other hand,

13:27.188 --> 13:29.587
would have given his strong right arm

13:29.588 --> 13:32.027
for a nice, juicy,
complicated murder.

13:32.028 --> 13:34.188
Settling in?

13:35.508 --> 13:37.708
You do realise you're expected
to wear a uniform?

13:37.709 --> 13:41.347
Well, I'm an investigator, Doreen,
so people expect me to wear a suit.

13:41.348 --> 13:44.147
Well, I expect you
to wear a uniform.

13:44.148 --> 13:46.187
Well, I haven't put it on
in over 20 years,

13:46.188 --> 13:47.668
so it probably doesn't fit me.

13:47.669 --> 13:50.627
Ha! Liar. You haven't gained
a kilo since you were 16.

13:50.628 --> 13:53.067
Well, I've misplaced
my pith helmet, then.

13:53.068 --> 13:55.268
Oh, Gary, please. For me, huh?

13:57.388 --> 14:00.027
Here, you'll need these.

14:00.028 --> 14:03.187
HR - it's one of
your main duties.

14:03.188 --> 14:05.388
You up to the speed on
the Anti-Discrimination Act?

14:06.428 --> 14:09.347
The Equal Opportunity for Women
in the Workplace?

14:09.348 --> 14:11.507
Disability Discrimination Act?

14:11.508 --> 14:14.347
Here. Read and digest.

14:14.348 --> 14:16.908
And good luck.
Thank you.

14:19.108 --> 14:20.627
Brownie.

14:20.628 --> 14:22.548
Please tell me you got something.

14:31.468 --> 14:33.188
There's no name
attached to the note?

14:33.189 --> 14:36.028
Anonymous.
Came through Crime Stoppers.

14:41.988 --> 14:43.468
Just that and the map reference.

14:43.469 --> 14:46.587
So, what, some smart-arse boosts
a car, sets it on fire,

14:46.588 --> 14:48.308
and that's supposed to
send us a message?

14:48.309 --> 14:51.507
It's registered to a bloke
who's been dead for years.

14:51.508 --> 14:53.508
So, it's not stolen?

14:54.628 --> 14:56.987
You think this is Perish?

14:56.988 --> 14:58.866
Until proven otherwise,
I'm assuming it is.

14:58.867 --> 15:00.388
Who else would be worrying
about Tuno?

15:00.389 --> 15:02.868
The pressure's getting to him.

15:04.668 --> 15:06.828
So, he's gonna cut us up
and set us on fire, is he?

15:08.028 --> 15:11.068
Reminds me of a baboon, running
around, showing his big red arse.

15:26.068 --> 15:27.906
Every time I see her,
I just go to water.

15:27.907 --> 15:30.108
I know it's stupid. She doesn't
mean anything to me anymore.

15:30.109 --> 15:33.987
It's just... I can't talk.
I can't make decisions.

15:33.988 --> 15:38.387
'Crime manager' isn't an
entirely accurate job description.

15:38.388 --> 15:39.987
Gary, it wasn't my fault.

15:39.988 --> 15:41.948
She never even told me
she was married.

15:41.949 --> 15:44.227
In addition to
tackling such weighty matters

15:44.228 --> 15:46.067
as stolen shopping trolleys,

15:46.068 --> 15:48.947
Gary Jubelin found himself
at the sharp end

15:48.948 --> 15:51.427
of human resources management,

15:51.428 --> 15:54.508
which meant listening to
every sob story in town.

15:55.788 --> 15:58.547
The matters he dealt with
ranged from affairs of the heart

15:58.548 --> 16:00.587
to the more prosaic.

16:00.588 --> 16:03.347
For example, the young
general duties officer

16:03.348 --> 16:05.107
distressed by the fact

16:05.108 --> 16:07.188
a male colleague routinely used
the station showers

16:07.189 --> 16:09.027
as a lavatory.

16:09.028 --> 16:10.748
He shits in the shower.

16:11.868 --> 16:14.787
There you go, I've said it.
I beg your pardon?

16:14.788 --> 16:21.508
Senior Constable Nathan Smith
defecates in the shower stalls.

16:22.628 --> 16:24.308
In the male change room.

16:26.828 --> 16:28.507
Regularly.

16:28.508 --> 16:31.547
But the stories
that walked into Gary's office

16:31.548 --> 16:33.827
weren't all salt and manure.

16:33.828 --> 16:35.947
Valuable nuggets of intelligence

16:35.948 --> 16:39.147
sometimes arrived
in unexpected packages.

16:39.148 --> 16:42.467
The local patrol thought
the guy was a jumper

16:42.468 --> 16:44.667
because he was in heaps of debt

16:44.668 --> 16:47.148
and his car was found at The Gap.

16:48.388 --> 16:53.587
Uh, The... The Gap,
the... famous suicide spot?

16:53.588 --> 16:55.787
It's a notorious suicide spot.

16:55.788 --> 16:58.027
Yeah, but we don't think
it was suicide.

16:58.028 --> 17:00.467
Who's we?
Uh, Chatswood detectives.

17:00.468 --> 17:05.747
Me, Carr and... and Brenno.
You met them at muster.

17:05.748 --> 17:07.867
And why do you think that, son?

17:07.867 --> 17:09.666
Uh, Ben.

17:09.667 --> 17:11.267
Ben?

17:11.268 --> 17:14.426
Gary Jubelin was
born to catch murderers.

17:14.428 --> 17:18.867
Like a dog chasing cars,
it was a habit he couldn't kick.

17:18.867 --> 17:21.467
He took murder personally.

17:21.468 --> 17:24.347
It didn't matter to Gary
if the victim was an innocent child,

17:24.348 --> 17:26.467
a petty crook like Terry Falconer

17:26.468 --> 17:29.227
or even a shonky used-car dealer.

17:29.228 --> 17:31.628
The other night, Ljubic gets
a call from someone...

17:31.629 --> 17:34.267
That's why he threw himself
into the Bob Ljubic case,

17:34.268 --> 17:37.507
when he could have easily passed
it up the line to Homicide.

17:37.508 --> 17:39.027
Bob goes off to the meeting...

17:39.028 --> 17:41.228
If the bosses wouldn't let him
chase Anthony Perish,

17:41.229 --> 17:43.988
he'd find other killers to hunt.

17:48.788 --> 17:51.787
Well, go and get Carr and Beano
and come back in here.

17:51.788 --> 17:53.787
Uh, Brenno.
Who?

17:53.788 --> 17:55.268
It's Brenno.

17:57.268 --> 18:00.227
So Ljubic sells prestige cars?

18:00.228 --> 18:03.107
He does some car rebirthing
on the side. He moves some drugs.

18:03.108 --> 18:05.267
And that's how he's connected
to Anthony Perish.

18:05.268 --> 18:07.066
No, he's not connected
to Anthony Perish.

18:07.067 --> 18:08.988
He's got nothing
to do with Anthony Perish.

18:08.989 --> 18:11.547
It's a Chatswood matter
because that's where he lives.

18:11.548 --> 18:14.507
And why do you keep turning them?
Well, isn't that how you cook them?

18:14.508 --> 18:16.348
No, it's not.
Well, how do you...?

18:16.349 --> 18:19.507
You're makin' 'em dizzy.
Just... beat it.

18:19.508 --> 18:21.507
Turn 'em once.

18:21.508 --> 18:22.988
Yeah.

18:24.588 --> 18:28.748
Why don't we go to the movies
on the weekend? No kids.

18:30.428 --> 18:31.948
What do you wanna go see?

18:33.268 --> 18:35.787
I want to see
'Lord of the Rings' at Erina.

18:35.788 --> 18:37.748
Part 3, the stirring climax.

18:39.988 --> 18:41.588
I was gonna give Brownie a hand.

18:43.428 --> 18:45.348
No time for climaxes?

18:46.388 --> 18:48.067
That's sad.

18:48.068 --> 18:50.467
You go. You'll have a good time.

18:50.468 --> 18:52.788
Oh, it'll be great. I'll go alone.
You'll be alright.

18:54.068 --> 18:56.907
Anyway, know what my boys did?
What?

18:56.908 --> 18:59.188
They figured Ljubic
had to cross the Harbour Bridge

18:59.189 --> 19:00.787
to get from his house to The Gap.

19:00.788 --> 19:03.627
So, they took the CCTV
from the toll booths, right,

19:03.628 --> 19:05.548
and they spotted a car behind
his Porsche Cayenne.

19:05.549 --> 19:08.547
A Ford Forte registered
to Jason Clive McCall.

19:08.548 --> 19:10.708
You had anything to do with him?

19:11.708 --> 19:13.748
He might be one of the killers.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.787
Gary, why don't you just
hand it over to Homicide?

19:18.788 --> 19:20.508
Because they'd probably fuck it up.

19:20.509 --> 19:22.107
Oh, everybody'd fuck it up.
Hey!

19:22.108 --> 19:24.026
Hey, look, these guys
are doing good work.

19:24.027 --> 19:25.506
It's good training for 'em.

19:25.507 --> 19:27.428
Yeah, not to mention
alleviating boredom

19:27.429 --> 19:29.028
for a certain crime manager.

19:34.548 --> 19:37.707
While Gary was keeping
himself busy at Chatswood,

19:37.708 --> 19:40.347
Tim Browne used
his rostered days off

19:40.348 --> 19:43.027
to go back to his roots
in the west.

19:43.028 --> 19:44.587
Brownie.

19:44.588 --> 19:46.707
G'day, Mud. How you been?

19:46.708 --> 19:50.347
You know what this is?
It's a souvenir.

19:50.348 --> 19:53.227
From Lithgow correctional
bed and breakfast.

19:53.228 --> 19:55.188
Thanks to you, old mate.

19:56.428 --> 19:59.348
Crime doesn't pay.
Told you that several times.

20:01.268 --> 20:03.427
You're a long way from home.

20:03.428 --> 20:07.308
I'm working the Terry Falconer
matter. You ever hear anything?

20:16.588 --> 20:18.307
They fuckin' kill people.

20:18.308 --> 20:20.588
Someone gets in their way,
anyone gets in their way,

20:20.589 --> 20:22.947
and you're gone - G-A-W-N.

20:22.948 --> 20:25.467
Yeah, one day we're gonna
take this guy off the street

20:25.468 --> 20:28.187
and some smart bastard's
gonna claim that reward.

20:28.188 --> 20:29.828
A hundred Gs.

20:31.508 --> 20:35.228
By the way, you ever hear of
a bloke called Muzz?

20:37.908 --> 20:40.428
Doesn't ring any bells.

20:42.388 --> 20:43.867
Once upon a time,

20:43.868 --> 20:46.387
we had round-the-clock
surveillance on this bloke.

20:46.388 --> 20:48.348
Back in the Dreamtime, mate.

20:51.628 --> 20:54.268
So Anthony Perish never even
drops in for a cup of coffee?

20:55.908 --> 20:57.828
After three weeks
of getting a numb bum,

20:57.829 --> 20:59.588
I can confidently say no.

21:00.908 --> 21:02.787
But Undies might lead us to him.

21:02.788 --> 21:04.587
Hopefully.

21:04.588 --> 21:09.827
I've been thinking about Anthony -
his reputation.

21:09.828 --> 21:12.868
Terry Falconer can't be the first
poor bastard he chopped to bits.

21:13.988 --> 21:15.627
How many more?

21:15.628 --> 21:18.707
While Tim and Gary
fanned the dying embers

21:18.708 --> 21:20.747
of the Terry Falconer
investigation,

21:20.748 --> 21:24.747
Anthony Perish cranked up
the company's operation,

21:24.748 --> 21:27.867
producing speed and ecstasy
in volume

21:27.868 --> 21:30.307
and dispatching it
around the country.

21:30.308 --> 21:32.427
The Nullarbor run
to Western Australia

21:32.428 --> 21:35.507
was a regular gig for truckies
willing to take a risk

21:35.508 --> 21:39.507
in return for a fast,
very large buck.

21:39.508 --> 21:43.867
Of course, there was always a danger
they might succumb to temptation.

21:43.868 --> 21:47.348
But Anthony had ways of
keeping their minds focused.

21:55.028 --> 21:57.267
- Hello?
- G'day, mate.

21:57.268 --> 21:59.507
My name's Chicken Steve.

21:59.508 --> 22:02.827
Anthony wanted me to give you
a call and say g'day.

22:02.828 --> 22:05.347
He wants to know if you're
enjoying the hot dog,

22:05.348 --> 22:07.508
the vanilla slice
and the cup of coffee.

22:13.708 --> 22:16.547
As it continues to
worsen, the Federal Government...

22:16.548 --> 22:18.028
Hey.

22:19.628 --> 22:21.268
Sorry, mate. I got held up.

22:23.188 --> 22:25.147
No.

22:25.148 --> 22:27.307
No, don't give it a second thought.

22:27.308 --> 22:31.427
We've had a lovely time,
sitting here.

22:31.428 --> 22:33.787
Well, we've gotta know
what Perish is up to.

22:33.788 --> 22:36.987
There's no-one else that can do it
and old Brownie's by himself.

22:36.988 --> 22:38.867
Oh...

22:38.868 --> 22:41.908
Poor old Brownie. I... I understand.

22:42.948 --> 22:44.708
What about tomorrow, me and you,
we go see a movie?

22:45.868 --> 22:47.627
No, what about poor old Brownie?

22:47.628 --> 22:50.067
He'll be so lonely
without you holding his hand.

22:50.068 --> 22:52.107
Well, we don't have to
go see a movie.

22:52.108 --> 22:55.427
We can go to... go for a run.

22:55.428 --> 22:57.107
Go shopping.

22:57.108 --> 22:59.067
Oh...

22:59.068 --> 23:01.068
Fuck shopping.

23:04.628 --> 23:06.108
Fair enough.

23:09.548 --> 23:11.907
What are you doing?
Cleaning up.

23:11.908 --> 23:14.667
Well, if I wanted it cleaned up
I would have said "Clean up."

23:14.668 --> 23:16.187
Leave it.

23:16.188 --> 23:18.507
Just relax, Pam.

23:18.508 --> 23:21.227
No, I said leave it.
I said leave it!

23:21.228 --> 23:23.427
If I want it cleaned up,
I'll do it myself.

23:23.428 --> 23:26.708
Gives me something to do
on these cold, lonely nights.

23:28.548 --> 23:30.268
Poor old Brownie.

23:55.129 --> 23:56.968
Evening, Brownie.

23:56.969 --> 23:59.208
Mud.

23:59.209 --> 24:01.009
Thought you'd given up
breaking into cars.

24:02.289 --> 24:04.408
Muzz, wasn't it?

24:04.409 --> 24:06.489
I got a name for ya.

24:07.569 --> 24:09.729
This time it's gonna cost ya.

24:13.329 --> 24:16.648
Matthew Robert Lawton.

24:16.649 --> 24:19.049
Also known as...

24:21.689 --> 24:23.209
Muzz.

25:33.649 --> 25:35.688
What are you bastards doing?

25:35.689 --> 25:37.689
Building a battleship?

26:04.689 --> 26:07.769
You bloody little beauty!

26:15.769 --> 26:19.168
Two choices - let him run
while we keep on building a brief

26:19.169 --> 26:20.649
strong enough to put him away.

26:20.650 --> 26:24.208
Which could take years.
It already has taken years.

26:24.209 --> 26:26.449
Or pick him up on an unrelated
charge, put him on hold.

26:28.529 --> 26:31.888
We could do that, and feed it
to the media, keep the vibe going,

26:31.889 --> 26:34.049
encourage the people
he's pissed off to come forward.

26:34.050 --> 26:36.208
We could give the reward
another run.

26:36.209 --> 26:38.528
But you'd want to make sure

26:38.529 --> 26:41.288
he's kept off the streets for
a long, long time, wouldn't you?

26:41.289 --> 26:44.168
Problem.
Perish is ultra-careful.

26:44.169 --> 26:48.208
Keeps his nose clean. Always has.
What's that expression you guys use?

26:48.209 --> 26:50.329
'Load him up'. Perish, I mean.

26:52.049 --> 26:54.088
I'm kidding.
Oh, I'm tempted.

26:54.089 --> 26:57.768
What's that drug matter he got
charged with when he was a kid?

26:57.769 --> 26:59.928
The '92 matter?
When he did the runner?

26:59.929 --> 27:01.728
It's better than nothing.

27:01.729 --> 27:04.208
You could run it by the Drug Squad.

27:04.209 --> 27:06.528
He can't know we're behind it.

27:06.529 --> 27:09.289
I wonder if any of the original
crew are still on the job.

27:27.689 --> 27:29.368
Tony Maloney?

27:29.369 --> 27:30.848
Tim Browne.

27:30.849 --> 27:32.328
How do you do?

27:32.329 --> 27:34.968
I'm here to ask you a favour.

27:34.969 --> 27:37.128
I thought you were
from the lottery office.

27:37.129 --> 27:40.088
Yeah.
What can I do for you?

27:40.089 --> 27:42.728
Early '90s, Tony -
you were Drug Squad.

27:42.729 --> 27:46.289
Yeah. The good old days.

27:48.369 --> 27:51.168
Do you remember a bust
at Leppington that went wrong?

27:51.169 --> 27:54.568
1992, it was. A kid called
Anthony Perish ran like a rabbit.

27:54.569 --> 27:56.729
You filed an arrest warrant
that's never been executed.

27:56.730 --> 28:00.488
That's ancient history.
What are you after him for now?

28:00.489 --> 28:03.088
'Cause he's a big deal now.
Yeah?

28:03.089 --> 28:04.689
He's got meth labs
all over the state.

28:04.690 --> 28:08.248
They say every cook-up, he produces
100-odd kilos of pills.

28:08.249 --> 28:09.368
Sheesh.

28:09.369 --> 28:11.209
Supplies half the bike gangs
between here and Perth.

28:11.210 --> 28:13.488
But he's smart -
does it by remote control.

28:13.489 --> 28:14.969
We've got nothing new on him.

28:14.970 --> 28:17.608
Well, you know where to find him?
Yeah.

28:17.609 --> 28:19.129
Why don't you arrest him yourself?

28:20.129 --> 28:21.607
Uh, we don't want to tip our hand.

28:21.608 --> 28:23.207
You know, we're looking
at the big picture.

28:23.208 --> 28:24.929
Joint task force
with other agencies.

28:24.930 --> 28:28.488
Other agencies?

28:28.489 --> 28:31.928
Hope they're using Vaseline.
Yeah.

28:31.929 --> 28:33.689
We take Perish
off the street for a while,

28:33.690 --> 28:35.209
we give the tree a good shake.

28:36.569 --> 28:38.569
You'd be doing us a favour.

28:39.569 --> 28:43.608
Doing YOU a favour? I don't owe
you new-age cops a thing.

28:43.609 --> 28:45.968
No, I know.

28:45.969 --> 28:47.889
But we'd appreciate it.

28:49.849 --> 28:52.609
Make a change from
slashing grass.

28:55.049 --> 28:58.129
Cut it down,
grows straight back up again.

28:59.689 --> 29:01.249
There you are. Have a go.

29:12.689 --> 29:14.729
Shut the fuck up, Heidi!

29:20.329 --> 29:22.328
Ohh, look at that!

29:22.329 --> 29:25.368
Oh, sweet as.
Good as gold.

29:25.369 --> 29:26.888
Stop a tank.

29:26.889 --> 29:29.209
Yeah, well, let's hope
it doesn't come to that, eh?

29:36.169 --> 29:37.808
Let the dog off!

29:37.809 --> 29:42.928
Get on the ground!
Get on the ground! Get down!

29:42.929 --> 29:46.649
On your knees. On your knees!
Get down.

29:50.569 --> 29:52.129
Piss off.

29:54.169 --> 29:55.728
Anthony Perish?

29:55.729 --> 29:58.008
Who are you?

29:58.009 --> 30:00.609
We've got some
unfinished business, son.

30:20.209 --> 30:22.609
He's gone and built himself a bunker.

30:24.369 --> 30:27.529
He's either got a heap of enemies,
or he's paranoid as Frank O'Rourke.

30:28.729 --> 30:30.209
Gary?

31:17.529 --> 31:19.688
Anthony Perish
spent months on remand

31:19.689 --> 31:22.448
before his ancient drugs matter
came before the court.

31:22.449 --> 31:27.449
But with money and friends,
he survived prison better than most.

31:28.889 --> 31:30.768
So, can I get you anything?

31:30.769 --> 31:32.809
No, I'm... I'm all good.

31:40.009 --> 31:43.208
Bank account numbers belonging to
a few young blokes in here.

31:43.209 --> 31:45.649
Put $100 in each one,
every week, alright?

31:49.569 --> 31:51.369
How to win friends
and influence people.

31:52.849 --> 31:54.848
This drugs charge thing's
just a cover.

31:54.849 --> 31:56.848
Something else is going on.

31:56.849 --> 31:59.289
What - not Falcon...
Shut up!

32:01.889 --> 32:03.888
Nah, they got me in the frame
for Didi and Baba.

32:03.889 --> 32:05.968
What?!
Yeah.

32:05.969 --> 32:08.088
I know. Fuckin' cops.

32:08.089 --> 32:10.289
I gotta get out of here, mate.

32:12.249 --> 32:15.689
Alright?
Mm. Mm.

32:22.889 --> 32:24.409
Hello?

32:26.329 --> 32:29.129
Is this Tony Maloney?
Who's this?

32:30.289 --> 32:31.529
How's Nathan?

32:33.049 --> 32:36.008
What? Who are you?

32:36.009 --> 32:38.808
Your grandson, Nathan -
I heard he's got cystic fibrosis.

32:38.809 --> 32:40.568
That's... that's just awful.

32:40.569 --> 32:42.649
Yeah, it must be
a real worry for ya.

32:44.089 --> 32:45.648
Poor little bugger.

32:45.649 --> 32:47.849
You might want to
keep an eye on him.

32:58.129 --> 33:02.368
Gary? Me.
No sign of Tony Maloney.

33:02.369 --> 33:03.928
Well, ring his mobile.

33:03.929 --> 33:05.648
Oh, shit,
I didn't think of that!

33:05.649 --> 33:08.248
Sorry. Look, just... He might be
running late. Just keep trying.

33:08.249 --> 33:10.169
I gotta go, Brownie.

33:13.849 --> 33:15.488
Hello, strangers.

33:15.489 --> 33:17.928
Gaz. Love the new outfit.

33:17.929 --> 33:20.728
I thought we could use
some reinforcements.

33:20.729 --> 33:23.328
Make sure everyone
introduces themselves around.

33:23.329 --> 33:25.127
Tuno mob, welcome to
Strike Force Lyttle.

33:25.128 --> 33:26.647
Now, we don't know
exactly what happened

33:26.648 --> 33:28.167
to Bob Ljubic that night
up at The Gap,

33:28.168 --> 33:30.009
so what we're after
are confessions.

33:30.010 --> 33:31.008
Ma'am?

33:31.009 --> 33:32.368
On the run sheets...

33:32.369 --> 33:34.448
you'll find your targets
and our objectives.

33:34.449 --> 33:38.168
We're gonna hit them simultaneously
so they can't talk to each other.

33:38.169 --> 33:40.448
What do you mean
he didn't fuckin' show up?

33:40.449 --> 33:42.289
Well, do you know where
that leaves us, Brownie?

33:42.290 --> 33:46.568
Well, I don't know. Go and find
Tony fuckin' Maloney!

33:46.569 --> 33:48.849
Oh, I miss him, don't you?

33:56.329 --> 33:58.008
Where's Jubelin?

33:58.009 --> 34:00.007
This fuckin' comedy's got
his fingerprints all over it.

34:00.008 --> 34:02.369
How'd he find out about the new
joint? That's what I wanna know.

34:02.370 --> 34:05.008
Well, maybe because some fuckwit
led 'em right to the front door, eh?

34:05.009 --> 34:06.887
Some fuckwit's too stupid to realise

34:06.888 --> 34:08.529
the whole task force
was following him.

34:08.530 --> 34:10.128
You know what started all this?

34:10.129 --> 34:13.007
You and your idiot mate and his
stupid piece-of-shit fuckin' boat!

34:13.009 --> 34:15.007
It was because you built
a meth lab with your mates

34:15.007 --> 34:16.487
in Didi and Baba's backyard.

34:16.487 --> 34:18.889
That's why they were killed.
You're a wanker. You know that?

34:18.889 --> 34:20.848
Anthony Perish?
Yeah?

34:20.849 --> 34:23.047
Federal Organised Crime Authority.

34:23.049 --> 34:25.408
You're holding a summons.
You're hereby served.

34:25.409 --> 34:27.248
What's this about?
It's all in the document.

34:27.250 --> 34:29.487
I remind you,
you are compelled to appear

34:29.489 --> 34:32.047
and you are compelled to answer
all questions put to you.

34:32.049 --> 34:34.848
Failure to do so
constitutes contempt

34:34.849 --> 34:37.049
and will result in
a custodial sentence.

34:43.208 --> 34:45.447
"Operation Eucalypt,

34:45.449 --> 34:48.768
"investigating the deaths of
Anthony Albert Perish Senior,

34:48.768 --> 34:50.608
"Frances Vera Perish,

34:50.609 --> 34:52.608
"Terrence Falconer,

34:52.609 --> 34:54.649
"Jasper Woodworth Pengilly."

34:58.729 --> 35:03.408
We've got e-tag records from
the Harbour Bridge tollbooths

35:03.409 --> 35:06.928
placing Jason McCall's car
two seconds behind Bob Ljubic's.

35:06.929 --> 35:09.369
I've got phone records here
from Jason McCall's house,

35:09.370 --> 35:13.048
in the name of the man Bob Ljubic
thought he was meeting that evening.

35:13.049 --> 35:14.728
Gary's best chance

35:14.729 --> 35:16.367
of wrapping up
the Bob Ljubic case

35:16.368 --> 35:18.607
was to get one of the two suspects
to roll on the other.

35:18.608 --> 35:20.127
We've got one of
Jason's colleagues

35:20.128 --> 35:21.609
who's made a statement...

35:21.610 --> 35:24.088
Step one, pick the weak link.

35:24.089 --> 35:27.808
Step two, outline the
irresistible case against him.

35:27.809 --> 35:32.248
Step three,
put a deal on the table.

35:32.249 --> 35:34.128
Standard operating procedure.

35:34.129 --> 35:36.808
What Gary wasn't expecting

35:36.809 --> 35:39.609
was the nugget
lobbed back in return.

35:41.289 --> 35:43.448
He couldn't wait to make
an induced statement.

35:43.449 --> 35:46.928
You know what else he said?
I fucking hate that.

35:46.929 --> 35:49.408
What? Oh, when a killer walks free?

35:49.409 --> 35:51.369
Yeah, in exchange for
locking up his mate.

35:51.370 --> 35:52.848
I mean...

35:52.849 --> 35:55.129
And then how's Mrs Ljubic
supposed to feel?

35:56.169 --> 35:58.848
Well, one out of two's
better than none out of two.

35:58.849 --> 36:01.648
Yeah. But it's not justice.

36:01.649 --> 36:04.208
No, but it's the system, Pam.
You know that.

36:04.209 --> 36:06.208
Well, how will you feel

36:06.209 --> 36:08.328
if you have to let Perish's pals
take a walk

36:08.329 --> 36:10.329
after what they did to
Terry Falconer?

36:15.209 --> 36:18.528
Got some news on Perish.
Actually, no, OK? No. No.

36:18.529 --> 36:20.929
We're having dinner without
Anthony Perish tonight.

36:20.930 --> 36:22.528
Well, you're the one who just...

36:22.529 --> 36:24.529
OK.
OK, OK.

36:27.329 --> 36:30.288
Mm, you know what?
I've got some news.

36:30.289 --> 36:34.448
You know how I do... occasionally,
I do prisoner transportation

36:34.449 --> 36:36.208
for the Immigration Department?

36:36.209 --> 36:37.767
Well, I have an assignment
next week

36:37.768 --> 36:40.127
and this time, I get to nominate
my male partner.

36:40.128 --> 36:41.569
So, guess where we're going.

36:42.609 --> 36:44.408
Beirut.

36:44.409 --> 36:46.529
We're going to Paris.

36:49.649 --> 36:51.688
And then after we drop
the prisoner off,

36:51.689 --> 36:54.728
we get a three-day lay-over
in a four-star hotel,

36:54.729 --> 36:56.808
and then we fly home
business class.

36:56.809 --> 36:59.568
What do you say, partner?

36:59.569 --> 37:01.048
This is next week?

37:01.049 --> 37:04.609
Mm-hm. We, uh, go on Monday,
we're back on Saturday.

37:08.089 --> 37:10.609
Perish is up before the Feds
next week.

37:11.929 --> 37:14.128
Me and Brownie get to go.

37:14.129 --> 37:17.328
After all this time,
I get to be in the same room.

37:17.329 --> 37:18.808
I get to see him.

37:18.809 --> 37:21.849
Yeah, but, baby, you're...

37:22.849 --> 37:24.928
You're not in Homicide anymore.

37:24.929 --> 37:27.208
You're certainly not OIC of Tuno.

37:27.209 --> 37:30.368
Technically, Tuno,
it doesn't even exist.

37:30.369 --> 37:33.929
Well, it's...

37:35.729 --> 37:37.649
You'd dump Paris for Perish?

37:41.569 --> 37:43.369
It's not...

37:47.409 --> 37:50.608
You know how I said the Irishman
gave his statement.

37:50.609 --> 37:52.088
Yeah.

37:52.089 --> 37:53.969
Well, after he gave his
statement, I asked him.

37:53.970 --> 37:56.528
I said, "Who are the major
players?" Know what he said?

37:56.529 --> 37:58.409
You wanna know the biggest
criminal on the east coast?

37:58.410 --> 38:00.328
Easy.

38:00.329 --> 38:02.208
That'd be Anthony Perish.

38:02.209 --> 38:04.648
Easy.

38:04.649 --> 38:07.728
That would be Anthony Perish.

38:07.729 --> 38:11.529
They say he's rubbed out
16 people or more. Probably more.

38:14.609 --> 38:16.809
16? Jesus.

38:21.849 --> 38:24.648
I can't get off the horse now, Pam.
I just... I fuckin' can't.

38:24.649 --> 38:28.049
Yeah, I know. I know you can't.

38:32.289 --> 38:34.489
The fish was really good.
Mm.

38:40.049 --> 38:42.809
You done?
Yeah.

39:04.329 --> 39:04.489
You currently have
no official status

39:06.129 --> 39:08.248
in the Terry Falconer
murder investigation?

39:08.249 --> 39:10.808
Yes? No?
On every second Tuesday?

39:10.809 --> 39:12.647
I regularly meet with
Detective Sergeant...

39:12.648 --> 39:14.369
You realise
the Federal Organised Crime...

39:14.370 --> 39:17.728
who is currently OIC
and who consults with me.

39:17.729 --> 39:19.407
Authority Act
grants us autonomy?

39:19.408 --> 39:21.289
We have no obligation
to consult with you

39:21.290 --> 39:22.888
or inform you of our actions.

39:22.889 --> 39:24.688
Really?

39:24.689 --> 39:27.089
We're here to help in any way
we can. Background briefings...

39:27.090 --> 39:30.328
Suggested line of questioning.
Suggested line of questioning.

39:30.329 --> 39:32.047
If we get stuck,
I'll be sure to call.

39:32.048 --> 39:34.209
We understand you're the Feds -
all-powerful and all-seeing...

39:34.210 --> 39:37.688
but we cannot over-emphasise
the importance of our Informant X.

39:37.689 --> 39:39.728
That's Frank O'Rourke?
Who's the linchpin.

39:39.729 --> 39:42.129
We can't afford Perish to know
he's given us a statement.

39:42.130 --> 39:44.888
'Cause if he goes on the run again,
we won't find the prick.

39:44.889 --> 39:47.768
The statement's our ace.
We hear you.

39:47.769 --> 39:49.407
You'll provide us
with copies, hard and soft?

39:49.408 --> 39:51.809
Since you've got access to
the COPS database whenever you like,

39:51.810 --> 39:53.888
you can help yourself.

39:53.889 --> 39:55.408
Thank you.

39:55.409 --> 39:59.969
You're welcome to monitor
the Perish hearing... remotely.

40:06.969 --> 40:08.848
I feel violated.

40:08.849 --> 40:11.168
You look like you need counselling.

40:11.169 --> 40:13.369
You're able to get away from
Chatswood for a bit?

40:13.370 --> 40:14.848
Better we're both here.

40:14.849 --> 40:17.408
No problemo.

40:17.409 --> 40:19.369
I never met
Terry Falconer personally.

40:19.370 --> 40:22.048
I wouldn't know him
from a bar of soap.

40:22.049 --> 40:25.288
So, why would I go to
all the trouble of killing him

40:25.289 --> 40:27.768
and chopping his head off
or whatever they did?

40:27.769 --> 40:30.608
Fear. Hate.

40:30.609 --> 40:34.088
Greed. Revenge.

40:34.089 --> 40:36.008
Well, can't argue with that.

40:36.009 --> 40:38.049
Whoever did it must have
really hated his guts, eh?

40:38.050 --> 40:39.968
You know, people say that he was

40:39.969 --> 40:42.928
a drug-dealing, low-life bikie scum
with plenty of enemies.

40:42.929 --> 40:44.448
I don't know, pick one, eh?

40:44.449 --> 40:47.408
Mr Falconer was abducted...
Calm, isn't he?

40:47.409 --> 40:48.847
From his place of business,

40:48.848 --> 40:50.769
a smash repair shop
called Wreck-a-Mended...

40:51.769 --> 40:54.728
in Ingleburn, at around 3pm
that day, November 16.

40:54.729 --> 40:57.648
Where were you at that time,
Mr Perish?

40:57.649 --> 41:01.568
Christ, it's years ago.

41:01.569 --> 41:04.128
You don't strike me as
the kind of man

41:04.129 --> 41:07.288
who forgets important dates.

41:07.289 --> 41:12.648
I, um... I had an appointment
with a physio at Lindfield.

41:12.649 --> 41:16.528
Yeah. I'll bet it checks out.

41:16.529 --> 41:18.968
You can furnish
a name and contact details?

41:18.969 --> 41:22.488
What's the difference between
'au revoir' and 'adieu'?

41:22.489 --> 41:23.728
Huh?

41:23.729 --> 41:26.049
The difference between
'au revoir' and 'adieu'?

41:27.329 --> 41:29.768
Oh, uh, one's like 'goodbye',

41:29.769 --> 41:31.488
and the other's 'see you later',

41:31.489 --> 41:34.168
but... I don't know which.

41:34.169 --> 41:36.329
Prison sentence awaits those
that lie to the Commission.

41:36.330 --> 41:39.008
Yeah, no, no, I do. I deny it.

41:39.009 --> 41:42.448
No, I'm an innocent man,
on my mother's blessed eyes.

41:42.449 --> 41:45.608
We'll leave your mother out of it,
if you don't mind.

41:45.609 --> 41:49.968
I'll return to the Falconer murder
in a moment, Mr Commissioner.

41:49.969 --> 41:51.568
What's your occupation?

41:51.569 --> 41:53.409
In other words,
how do you earn a living?

41:53.410 --> 41:58.168
I'm a silent partner
in my family's poultry business.

41:58.169 --> 42:01.608
I lease paddocks from my brother
and grow broccoli.

42:01.609 --> 42:04.088
And what do you earn
in an average year?

42:04.089 --> 42:06.208
Oh, $60,000.

42:06.209 --> 42:08.128
According to intelligence,

42:08.129 --> 42:10.728
you live very well
on such a modest income.

42:10.729 --> 42:12.449
I'm a lucky punter.

42:13.529 --> 42:15.968
When's the last time
you filed a tax return?

42:15.969 --> 42:18.368
Never.

42:18.369 --> 42:19.849
I imagine that's about to change.

42:19.850 --> 42:22.769
Do you know a man named
Frank Xavier O'Rourke?

42:27.449 --> 42:29.728
Don't think so, no.

42:29.729 --> 42:31.768
Well, I want you to think back...
Fuck!

42:31.769 --> 42:34.528
To Wednesday, 17 October 2001.

42:34.529 --> 42:36.768
Did you attend a dinner
at a Newtown restaurant

42:36.769 --> 42:39.728
with your brother, Andrew Perish,
and Frank O'Rourke?

42:39.729 --> 42:42.969
I just said I don't know
any Frank O'Rourke.

42:45.049 --> 42:46.529
But now you've jogged me memory,

42:46.530 --> 42:50.688
uh, my brother did have a friend
called Tink, I think it was.

42:50.689 --> 42:51.968
Jesus...

42:51.969 --> 42:54.088
From his days in
a motorcycle club. Is that him?

42:54.089 --> 42:56.328
Were you at dinner with them

42:56.329 --> 42:58.488
in a Newtown restaurant
on that date?

42:58.489 --> 43:00.488
Jesus, I don't know.

43:00.489 --> 43:03.088
I can't remember. I might have been.

43:03.089 --> 43:06.368
Well, I eat out a fair bit.
Which restaurant?

43:06.369 --> 43:08.329
Frank O'Rourke claims that
at this particular dinner,

43:08.330 --> 43:11.888
you discussed using
his services and his boat

43:11.889 --> 43:13.568
to dispose of body parts.

43:13.569 --> 43:15.528
Is that true?

43:15.529 --> 43:17.568
Does he, now?

43:17.569 --> 43:19.489
Well, what do you say?
Is that true?

43:19.490 --> 43:22.568
I'd say he's lying.
Shit!

43:22.569 --> 43:24.929
Mr O'Rourke made a full statement
to Strike Force Tuno,

43:24.930 --> 43:27.288
claiming you made
several approaches to him

43:27.289 --> 43:29.247
in the weeks prior to
Terry Falconer's murder

43:29.248 --> 43:31.089
to discuss the disposal
of the body.

43:31.090 --> 43:32.848
Well, he's a bloody liar.

43:32.849 --> 43:35.248
I don't know why he's pointing
the finger at me.

43:35.249 --> 43:36.848
Maybe 'cause he's the killer.

43:36.849 --> 43:39.049
What do they call that,
blame shifting?

43:40.489 --> 43:42.689
I can't watch this fuckin' shit.

44:15.129 --> 44:16.809
Fuck!

44:27.489 --> 44:29.488
Nearly six years had passed

44:29.489 --> 44:31.208
since Terry Falconer's murder.

44:31.209 --> 44:35.409
Anthony Perish had slipped out of
Gary Jubelin's grip a second time.

44:36.649 --> 44:40.489
Gary was afraid he was running
a marathon without end.

44:42.849 --> 44:44.329
OK, now, you take it easy, mate.

44:44.330 --> 44:48.009
You're not Valentino Rossi, OK?
Right, go.

44:50.689 --> 44:52.408
Shootin' up, isn't he?

44:52.409 --> 44:54.608
That's a nice little machine, mate.

44:54.609 --> 44:56.808
You done good.

44:56.809 --> 44:58.968
Yeah, 15% discount with cash.

44:58.969 --> 45:02.088
Yeah, keep going, mate. Well done!

45:02.089 --> 45:04.768
He's a good kid.
Yeah.

45:04.769 --> 45:06.688
Don't let him stay up too late.

45:06.689 --> 45:08.328
One last thing...

45:08.329 --> 45:11.328
you've gotta find out what the jacks
have done with Tink.

45:11.329 --> 45:14.368
Oh... Shit, Rooster.

45:14.369 --> 45:16.808
That won't be easy.

45:16.809 --> 45:19.489
Wanna do a life sentence
on account of Terry Falconer?

45:20.489 --> 45:22.288
Tink's gotta go, mate,

45:22.289 --> 45:24.169
'cause without him,
Tuno's got nothing.
