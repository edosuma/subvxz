<i> Okay, my little snow globes,</i>

00:21.872 --> 00:24.356
I found some mittens
for our snow tubing trip today.

00:24.508 --> 00:26.099
Not all the mittens
have matches,

00:26.252 --> 00:27.359
but you can mix them up

00:27.586 --> 00:28.952
like Punky Brewster did
with her shoes.

00:28.954 --> 00:30.011
Boy, she knew how to have fun.

00:30.089 --> 00:31.513
My snow pants are kind of tight.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.257
Guess I grew a little
since last winter.

00:33.275 --> 00:34.424
That's what happens
when we water you

00:34.443 --> 00:36.109
and give you lots of sunlight.

00:36.262 --> 00:38.262
(sighs) This coat seems
pretty aerodynamic.

00:38.355 --> 00:40.355
Probably not gonna get
a lot of wind resistance.

00:40.449 --> 00:42.357
-Good for snoobing.
-What's snoobing?

00:42.451 --> 00:44.935
Oh, like snow tubing?
Snoobing? I get it.

00:45.028 --> 00:45.936
Yeah, you do.

00:46.029 --> 00:47.287
These feel okay, I guess.

00:47.439 --> 00:48.955
Can you tell they're
giving me a wedgie?

00:49.050 --> 00:50.049
-No...?
-(doorbell rings)

00:50.200 --> 00:51.458
BOB:
That's probably Teddy.

00:51.552 --> 00:52.442
I'll let him in.

00:52.461 --> 00:53.960
Why is Teddy coming upstairs?

00:54.113 --> 00:55.112
Is the restaurant gonna be
up here today?

00:55.205 --> 00:56.446
No, he's coming to work on

00:56.465 --> 00:58.131
a bunch of little things
around the apartment.

00:58.284 --> 00:59.224
You know, like the
wobbly flusher on the toilet.

00:59.376 --> 01:00.801
We're finally gonna fix it.

01:00.895 --> 01:03.970
But our wobbly flusher makes
a funky sound when I jiggle it.

01:04.123 --> 01:05.046
Now what am I gonna jiggle?

01:05.066 --> 01:06.640
-Hey, Teddy.
-Hey, Linda.

01:06.809 --> 01:09.142
Oh, you kids are bundled up.
Going outside to play?

01:09.236 --> 01:11.219
I guess the snow's
not that old and dirty.

01:11.238 --> 01:12.979
-That's what we say about Dad.
-Gene.

01:13.132 --> 01:14.889
We're going snow tubing today.

01:14.967 --> 01:16.224
-Snoobing.
-Snoobing. Right.

01:16.243 --> 01:17.859
Oh, that sounds fun.

01:17.894 --> 01:19.227
You guys going
to Avalanche Mountain?

01:19.321 --> 01:20.470
Avalanche Mountain closed.

01:20.564 --> 01:22.973
Oh, no. Why'd it close?
Avalanche?

01:23.066 --> 01:24.249
No. Back taxes, I think.

01:24.476 --> 01:26.159
We're gonna try
this new place out in Redburn.

01:26.312 --> 01:28.570
-Wait. You guys are
going to Redburn today?
-Yeah, why?

01:28.664 --> 01:30.831
My mom's buried
in the cemetery in Redburn.

01:30.925 --> 01:32.407
She is? I didn't know that.

01:32.426 --> 01:35.260
Yeah. Uh, we didn't live there,
but it's a nice cemetery.

01:35.337 --> 01:36.987
I remember my dad
was sort of proud

01:37.080 --> 01:38.171
that he got her a plot there.

01:38.324 --> 01:39.581
Is that like getting into
a good school?

01:39.749 --> 01:42.175
Should I start doing more
extracurriculars now, or...?

01:42.328 --> 01:44.269
-Uh, no, Tina.
-Oh, good.

01:44.496 --> 01:48.107
Wait, you guys have never
visited my mom's grave.

01:48.258 --> 01:50.091
I mean, I haven't
been there myself

01:50.111 --> 01:51.835
in a really, really long time.

01:51.928 --> 01:54.338
But if you guys are
going to Redburn,

01:54.431 --> 01:55.930
maybe I'll come with you,

01:56.008 --> 01:57.691
and then maybe we can
all visit my mom's grave,

01:57.767 --> 02:00.268
and we can go snoobing
together afterwards?

02:00.287 --> 02:01.620
What are we gonna do
about the restaurant?

02:01.771 --> 02:04.456
We could close for now
and be back for the dinner rush.

02:04.533 --> 02:06.350
You're closing the restaurant
for lunch.

02:06.443 --> 02:08.702
I didn't plan on that,
but it's totally fine.

02:08.854 --> 02:09.777
I can change my plans.

02:09.872 --> 02:11.779
No big deal.
Mr. Flexible over here.

02:11.874 --> 02:13.357
-Easy, Teddy.
-Sorry. Sorry.

02:13.375 --> 02:16.117
Okay. We're going to see
your mom's grave,

02:16.211 --> 02:17.527
and then-then
we're gonna go snoobing.

02:17.696 --> 02:19.045
Uh, okay.

02:19.122 --> 02:21.640
You're saying "okay" in a way
that's not weird at all.

02:21.867 --> 02:25.385
Yeah. It's just, uh, you know,
my thing with cemeteries.

02:25.537 --> 02:27.813
Uh, they kind of give me
the heebie-jeebies.

02:27.964 --> 02:30.632
Heebie Jeebies is the name of
Ken's Oingo Boingo cover band.

02:30.726 --> 02:33.226
Oh, right, I forgot about
your cemetery thing.

02:33.379 --> 02:34.820
If you want,
you can stay at the restaurant

02:34.897 --> 02:35.970
and I'll take the kids today.

02:36.064 --> 02:37.322
Oh, that's an interesting idea.

02:37.474 --> 02:38.824
Keep the restaurant open. Linda?

02:38.975 --> 02:41.735
Uh, no, no, I'll go
and support my husband

02:41.829 --> 02:43.236
and all that good wife crap.

02:43.389 --> 02:44.830
-I mean, I love you.
-Hmm.

02:44.981 --> 02:45.906
LINDA:
Supportive. Yay.

02:46.667 --> 02:49.559
So, it's taking us
a little longer to get there

02:49.653 --> 02:50.727
than I thought it would.

02:50.746 --> 02:51.895
We hit some traffic.

02:52.064 --> 02:54.506
-And there were some pee stops.
-GENE: Mm-hmm.

02:54.733 --> 02:57.401
And it also took a while
to leave the apartment.

02:57.419 --> 03:00.237
Making cards for my mom,
for Grandma,

03:00.239 --> 03:02.255
seemed like a good idea
that I had,

03:02.349 --> 03:04.165
but it was time-consuming.

03:04.185 --> 03:05.500
Some of us nailed it.

03:05.594 --> 03:08.020
"You put the grand in grandma,
I'm guessing.

03:08.171 --> 03:09.913
I never met you. Love, Tina."

03:09.932 --> 03:11.431
Eh, it's no drawing of Grandma

03:11.525 --> 03:13.341
kickboxing all the clouds
in heaven.

03:13.435 --> 03:14.676
And I wrote, "I hope
you're giving heaven hell."

03:14.770 --> 03:16.361
I drew her as Uma Thurman
from that dancing scene

03:16.513 --> 03:18.346
with John Travolta
in<i> Pulp Fiction.</i>

03:18.515 --> 03:19.347
She'll love it.

03:19.366 --> 03:20.866
So, Dad, when was the last time

03:21.093 --> 03:22.034
you visited your mom's grave?

03:22.261 --> 03:24.870
Oh, I honestly can't remember.

03:25.021 --> 03:26.020
It was so many years ago.

03:26.040 --> 03:27.539
-Did you have hair?
-Yes.

03:27.766 --> 03:30.024
-On the part of your head
that I can see right now?
-Yes.

03:30.118 --> 03:33.194
-What color was it?
-GENE: Were you a spicy redhead
back then?

03:33.214 --> 03:34.771
-BOB: No.
-GENE: Boo.

03:34.790 --> 03:37.031
(Linda moaning nervously)

03:37.092 --> 03:38.124
BOB:
Lin, you okay?

03:38.277 --> 03:39.776
Oh, yeah. I'm just ducking down.

03:39.869 --> 03:41.962
You know, in case anything
comes out of the cemetery

03:42.114 --> 03:43.129
to suck my soul.

03:43.224 --> 03:44.872
I mean, I know
that's not how it works.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.283
Uh, no, that's how it works.

03:46.301 --> 03:47.467
Lin, you-you can stay
in the car.

03:47.561 --> 03:48.785
You don't have to get out.

03:48.804 --> 03:50.062
Me? In the car?

03:50.213 --> 03:51.638
By myself? In the cemetery?

03:51.732 --> 03:53.381
Are you playing Clue right now?

03:53.400 --> 03:55.234
Or how about we park
on the street?

03:55.461 --> 03:57.461
And the kids and I
can walk inside?

03:57.479 --> 03:59.980
Ah, no, I want
to be there for you.

04:00.074 --> 04:01.815
Seriously, you-you don't
have to come in.

04:01.967 --> 04:02.741
LINDA:
Really?

04:02.892 --> 04:04.058
Yes. Definitely.

04:04.152 --> 04:06.728
Okay. Kids, say
hi to Grandma for me.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.472
And if anything tries
to suck your soul,

04:08.490 --> 04:10.749
just spit on your fingertips,
slap the ground three times,

04:10.900 --> 04:11.825
and run back to the car.

04:11.994 --> 04:13.067
Okay.

04:13.829 --> 04:16.904
LOUISE:
Ooh, look at all that
white gold. Sorry, sorry.

04:16.999 --> 04:18.982
We're visiting Grandma now,
snoobing later.

04:19.001 --> 04:22.094
-I'm in the moment.
-BOB: All right, I-I think
we go that way?

04:22.245 --> 04:23.911
Or maybe that way?

04:24.006 --> 04:25.155
TINA:
Okay. Good start.

04:25.173 --> 04:27.340
Oh, that building
must be the office.

04:27.493 --> 04:28.825
Uh, let's go in and see
if they have a map.

04:28.918 --> 04:30.494
And maybe a hot cocoa
to warm up?

04:30.587 --> 04:32.253
TINA:
I'd sit by the fire
and have a hot cocoa.

04:32.273 --> 04:33.588
Guys, there's no cocoa.

04:33.682 --> 04:36.182
It's an office at a cemetery,
not a lodge.

04:36.277 --> 04:37.609
LOUISE:
Not with that attitude.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.670
Hi. Bathroom's
over there on the left.

04:40.689 --> 04:42.263
Uh, we don't need the bathroom.

04:42.283 --> 04:44.007
Oh, sorry, you had that look.

04:44.026 --> 04:45.600
Our dad just has
resting pee face.

04:45.619 --> 04:48.436
Louise. Um, I-I'm
looking for my mother's grave.

04:48.455 --> 04:50.271
Do you happen to have a map
I could use?

04:50.291 --> 04:51.865
Oh, yes. We have maps.

04:52.034 --> 04:53.292
Where did I put them?

04:53.443 --> 04:55.794
Sorry for your loss.
Uh, when did your mother pass?

04:56.021 --> 04:58.946
Um, 33 years ago...?

04:58.966 --> 05:00.299
I mean, 32.
Wait, how old am I?

05:00.450 --> 05:01.374
64?

05:01.527 --> 05:03.117
-Lower. I think.
-I'm not in my 60s.

05:03.244 --> 05:04.952
When was the last time
you visited us?

05:04.972 --> 05:07.306
Um, uh, you know,
it's been a while.

05:07.533 --> 05:08.122
Last year?

05:08.216 --> 05:11.143
Not quite last year, no.

05:11.294 --> 05:13.812
I-I think it's been,
um, uh, 20 years?

05:13.963 --> 05:15.055
Did you move out of state?

05:15.207 --> 05:16.464
That happens when people
move out of state.

05:16.558 --> 05:18.725
No, no, we've been...
We've been here.

05:18.877 --> 05:20.152
O-kay.

05:20.303 --> 05:21.820
Here's a map.
What's your mother's name?

05:22.047 --> 05:23.322
Belcher. Lily Belcher.

05:23.549 --> 05:25.657
Let's see...

05:25.884 --> 05:26.974
Ah, she's right over here.

05:27.069 --> 05:28.476
Okay, great. Thanks.

05:28.570 --> 05:30.311
Gonna get this baby ready
to give to Grandma.

05:30.331 --> 05:32.814
Oh, uh, sorry,
can't leave cards.

05:32.833 --> 05:33.999
Or anything except flowers.

05:34.226 --> 05:36.743
Oh, my mom didn't like
getting flowers.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.319
She was more
of a "don't pick 'em,

05:38.339 --> 05:39.987
just leave 'em"
kind of person.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.231
That's what I say about boogers.

05:41.249 --> 05:43.400
Well, cards are against
the rules, sorry.

05:43.418 --> 05:45.569
It's okay. We don't have
to leave our cards.

05:45.587 --> 05:47.754
I didn't work a long time
on mine or anything.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.255
I could leave Grandma
the granola bar

05:49.350 --> 05:50.757
I just found in my pocket.

05:50.851 --> 05:51.999
They're biodegradable.

05:52.094 --> 05:53.593
I hope she likes them
warm and smushed.

05:53.745 --> 05:56.930
(grunts) Is it rude to pick
your wedgie in a cemetery?

05:57.082 --> 05:58.023
I think it's rude not to.

05:58.174 --> 06:00.007
This map is really hard to read.

06:00.060 --> 06:02.268
It-it looks like
a Xerox of a Xerox.

06:02.421 --> 06:05.271
Oh, Papa, stop making up words
and find Grandma already.

06:05.424 --> 06:07.348
Okay, well, she's not here,

06:07.368 --> 06:10.927
because this seems like the
really old part of the cemetery.

06:11.096 --> 06:12.353
That I sort of remember?

06:12.431 --> 06:14.264
It's pretty, in a grave-y way.

06:14.282 --> 06:16.282
Also in a groovy way.

06:16.435 --> 06:19.269
That guy died in the '60s.
The 1860s.

06:19.271 --> 06:22.105
Lot of walking, which is cool.

06:22.198 --> 06:23.882
Should we have rented
Segues for this?

06:24.033 --> 06:25.700
-Cemetery Segues?
-Segue-teries?

06:25.794 --> 06:29.554
Okay, we're looking for a grave
that's flat on the ground.

06:29.706 --> 06:32.039
Uh, I can't read this.
Can-can you read this?

06:32.134 --> 06:33.967
Uh, are those even letters?

06:34.119 --> 06:35.877
I think it says Patrick-cake?

06:35.896 --> 06:38.471
No, it says Ram-snicks-icks.

06:38.624 --> 06:40.399
Uh, let's try this way.

06:40.626 --> 06:42.884
GENE:
I wonder how Mom's doing.
Do you think she remembers us?

06:42.978 --> 06:46.479
♪ Everything is fine,
everything's okay ♪

06:46.632 --> 06:48.240
♪ Not gonna look
at the cemetery ♪

06:48.391 --> 06:49.466
♪ Oh, my God I peeked ♪

06:49.484 --> 06:51.243
♪ Did the dead people see me? ♪

06:51.394 --> 06:52.911
♪ Are they gonna come get me? ♪

06:53.062 --> 06:55.914
♪ I sure hope not. ♪

06:56.065 --> 06:57.490
Okay, where are we?

06:57.643 --> 06:59.584
Don't worry, kids, we-we're
gonna find Grandma soon.

06:59.736 --> 07:03.404
Oh, what? It's fine,
we haven't been keeping track

07:03.573 --> 07:05.406
of how long
this is taking at all.

07:05.575 --> 07:09.577
Wait a second, are we back in
the old part of the cemetery?

07:09.671 --> 07:11.412
Oh, yeah. I remember that angel.

07:11.506 --> 07:13.490
The snow makes it look like
he's wearing a cool hat.

07:13.583 --> 07:15.416
I remember I said,
"Cool hat, bro."

07:15.436 --> 07:18.678
Oh, my God. I have no idea
where I'm supposed to go.

07:18.755 --> 07:22.941
I can't find my mom's grave.
I-I can't find my mom's grave.

07:23.092 --> 07:24.334
I am a horrible person.

07:24.352 --> 07:26.611
But a great granola bar opener?

07:26.763 --> 07:28.095
Please? Sir?

07:28.115 --> 07:30.449
Oh, yeah, look at that.
Good job, Dad.

07:34.012 --> 07:35.845
I'm so sorry, kids,
this-this was

07:35.939 --> 07:37.030
not supposed to take this long.

07:37.124 --> 07:38.364
You should be
snoobing right now.

07:38.459 --> 07:40.533
No, no, no, no, no, no.
It's fine, it's fine.

07:40.627 --> 07:43.520
But we can't go without
seeing my mom's grave.

07:43.613 --> 07:45.689
I mean, I don't really
believe in ghosts,

07:45.857 --> 07:48.374
but I feel like all these people
buried here are judging me

07:48.543 --> 07:51.136
and saying I'm a terrible son
and a terrible person.

07:51.287 --> 07:54.121
Maybe they're saying,
"No prob, Bob. Go snoob."

07:54.141 --> 07:55.882
Yeah, if the ghosts
are judging you,

07:56.034 --> 07:57.291
it's about so many other things.

07:57.460 --> 07:58.810
(grunts) I wish
I wore bigger pants.

07:59.037 --> 07:59.886
We all do.

08:00.038 --> 08:01.313
Uh, I'm gonna call your mom

08:01.464 --> 08:02.706
and tell her we're gonna
be a little longer.

08:02.799 --> 08:06.543
Okay, there's like
a 90% chance my whole family got

08:06.561 --> 08:08.320
pulled into a grave and that's
why they're taking so long.

08:08.396 --> 08:10.155
-(phone buzzes)
-Ah! Bob?

08:10.382 --> 08:13.325
BOB:
Lin-- We're-- We're, uh--
--metery-- a little bit l-- now.

08:13.476 --> 08:16.386
What? I-I can't hear you.
Y-You're breaking up.

08:16.404 --> 08:18.330
BOB:
I c-- hear you-- No, you're c--
--ing out.

08:18.557 --> 08:20.406
Did you get pulled
into a grave or not?

08:20.501 --> 08:23.727
Lin? Oh, disconnected.
Really bad reception here.

08:23.745 --> 08:25.837
I mean, it's not like
<i> they</i> need cell phone service,

08:26.064 --> 08:27.172
but I'd like to think

08:27.323 --> 08:29.156
wherever they are now
has unlimited texting.

08:29.251 --> 08:30.900
Ah, shoot. I lost him.

08:30.994 --> 08:32.010
-(phone buzzes)
-Hello? Bob?

08:32.161 --> 08:33.236
-Hey, Lin.
-Teddy?

08:33.255 --> 08:34.679
The toilet handle is fixed

08:34.831 --> 08:36.497
and I'm just finishing
patching that hole in the wall.

08:36.517 --> 08:38.332
Well, I won't be able
to walk by it

08:38.352 --> 08:39.518
and say "holey moley" anymore,

08:39.594 --> 08:41.411
but it'll be nice
to have a fixed-up wall.

08:41.429 --> 08:43.079
-Thanks, Teddy.
-Sure thing.

08:43.172 --> 08:45.598
Hey, I tried to call Bob and it
went straight to voice mail.

08:45.692 --> 08:48.509
Is he screening my calls?
Just kidding. But is he?

08:48.529 --> 08:51.178
No, he's in the cemetery
and there's bad reception there.

08:51.273 --> 08:53.198
Oh. Why aren't you
in the cemetery?

08:53.349 --> 08:55.016
I'm waiting for them in the car.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.535
-I couldn't go in.
-Oh, right.

08:56.762 --> 09:00.113
Your whole totally normal for an
adult fear of cemeteries thing.

09:00.265 --> 09:01.447
Yeah, I-I know.

09:01.542 --> 09:04.267
I feel bad, but why couldn't
Bob's mom be buried

09:04.286 --> 09:06.452
in a nice, well-lit mall
or something?

09:06.621 --> 09:09.047
But Lin, if anything
scary's gonna happen,

09:09.274 --> 09:10.774
it'll happen at night.
During the day,

09:10.792 --> 09:13.385
it's just a pretty park
with not enough places to sit.

09:13.612 --> 09:16.279
You know what, Teddy?
You're right.

09:16.372 --> 09:17.781
It's daytime. I'll be fine.

09:17.799 --> 09:21.059
Okay, I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna go inside the cemetery

09:21.228 --> 09:22.635
and I'm gonna be there for Bob.

09:22.788 --> 09:23.711
Good for you, Lin.

09:23.789 --> 09:25.713
Oof, I-I'm feeling
light-headed.

09:25.807 --> 09:26.898
Teddy, are you okay?

09:27.125 --> 09:28.792
Yeah, I think it's
low blood sugar.

09:28.885 --> 09:29.901
I skipped lunch.

09:30.128 --> 09:31.461
I couldn't think
of any place to eat

09:31.479 --> 09:32.979
and I'm not allowed
to pretend to be Bob

09:33.131 --> 09:34.239
and cook in the restaurant
anymore,

09:34.316 --> 09:35.815
so here we are. (chuckles)

09:35.909 --> 09:37.909
Listen, help yourself
to anything in the fridge.

09:38.061 --> 09:40.895
Okay. Thanks, Lin,
I'm gonna go do that right now.

09:40.989 --> 09:42.155
Okay, bye.

09:42.231 --> 09:43.898
Oh, but don't eat
the leftover meatloaf,

09:43.917 --> 09:44.991
we're saving that for dinner.

09:45.143 --> 09:46.585
Hello? Oh, he hung up.

09:46.736 --> 09:48.069
It's okay, I'll text him.

09:48.313 --> 09:50.997
And I'll text Bob his super
supportive wife is on her way.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.665
And he's lucky to have me.

09:52.818 --> 09:54.408
Eh, what do we got here?

09:54.502 --> 09:56.836
Oh, meatloaf.
Maybe I'll try this.

09:56.988 --> 09:58.079
Should I heat it up or...

09:58.098 --> 10:00.490
Oh. Oh, I'm eating it.
It's so good.

10:00.508 --> 10:01.507
Oh, and now I'm crying
a little bit.

10:01.584 --> 10:02.934
-Oh, I was so hungry.
-(phone dings)

10:03.086 --> 10:04.919
Oh. Oh...

10:04.938 --> 10:07.772
TINA:
Damn. The sun looks like
it's gonna set soon.

10:07.924 --> 10:08.848
It's 'snoob big deal.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.108
I mean, it's no big deal.

10:10.259 --> 10:12.444
Yeah, I-I'm sorry again, kids.

10:12.520 --> 10:14.446
Hey, there's still
a little time to snoob,

10:14.597 --> 10:16.856
if we found the grave,
like, right now.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.265
What if we shouted "Grandma"?

10:18.360 --> 10:19.618
Maybe she'd give us a sign

10:19.845 --> 10:22.103
and a branch would fall off
a tree or something?

10:22.122 --> 10:23.529
Grandma! Anything?

10:23.624 --> 10:26.625
Uh, okay, let's not shout
"Grandma" in a cemetery.

10:26.776 --> 10:29.110
A lot of people here
probably answer to that name.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.037
Oh, hey, look.
Uh, a flat section.

10:31.189 --> 10:33.114
We weren't here
already, were we?

10:33.208 --> 10:34.374
GENE:
I don't think so.

10:34.468 --> 10:36.117
I don't see any footprints
in the snow.

10:36.136 --> 10:37.527
Or any of the beautiful
butt-prints I made.

10:37.545 --> 10:39.545
Okay, great.
Let's try this section.

10:39.698 --> 10:42.456
-And make more butt-prints. And
this time I won't hold back.
-Mm.

10:42.550 --> 10:45.977
Thanks. Sorry about all
the weird questions.

10:46.129 --> 10:48.388
I know I don't need to hold my
breath the whole time I'm here

10:48.464 --> 10:50.206
so I don't die.
(chuckles nervously)

10:50.299 --> 10:52.041
You probably get that
a lot, right?

10:52.135 --> 10:54.878
No? Well, uh,
thanks for the map.

10:54.971 --> 10:57.656
Okay, here I am.

10:57.883 --> 10:59.399
Walking in the cemetery.

10:59.493 --> 11:02.143
All right, map,
where's my family?

11:02.220 --> 11:03.811
Oh, my God,
this thing is terrible.

11:03.830 --> 11:06.147
Are you my dad's mom? No.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.832
Are<i> you</i> my dad's mom? No.

11:08.059 --> 11:10.151
Gene, you don't have
to say that every time.

11:10.245 --> 11:11.394
What if I whisper it?

11:11.413 --> 11:12.912
(quietly):
Are you my dad's mom? No.

11:13.064 --> 11:15.507
Hey, so you know, I'm locking
the gate in about a half-hour.

11:15.734 --> 11:18.492
Which is exactly how much time
I have left in this podcast.

11:18.586 --> 11:21.513
Oh, God. Okay, well,
thanks for letting us know.

11:21.664 --> 11:23.664
H-Hey, could you
help us out real quick?

11:23.684 --> 11:24.590
Yep. You, too.

11:24.685 --> 11:26.351
BOB:
Oh, you're driving away.

11:26.502 --> 11:28.261
Good luck with the podcast,
I hear they're great!

11:28.413 --> 11:31.022
Hey, Dad? Didn't you
say Grandma died 33 years ago?

11:31.174 --> 11:32.598
-Yeah.
-All the graves that I'm seeing

11:32.767 --> 11:35.509
are for people who died within,
like, the last ten years.

11:35.529 --> 11:36.861
-Same.
-Yeah, same.

11:37.088 --> 11:38.271
(sighs) You know what?

11:38.347 --> 11:40.014
Let's just go to the car

11:40.108 --> 11:41.682
and-and come back another time.

11:41.776 --> 11:43.034
Th-This isn't gonna work.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.186
We're not gonna find the grave
in the next 30 minutes.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.446
Are you sure, Dad?

11:46.598 --> 11:47.764
Yeah. Let's go.

11:47.857 --> 11:50.116
And maybe you guys can get
a little snoobing in

11:50.210 --> 11:52.026
and the day won't be
a total waste.

11:52.120 --> 11:54.862
Okay. Um, sorry we
didn't find Grandma.

11:54.940 --> 11:56.289
Bye, Grandma!

11:56.383 --> 11:58.866
And I'm sorry I ate your granola
bar. You didn't miss much.

11:58.885 --> 12:01.535
When we come back, I'll bring
the kind with chocolate chips.

12:01.629 --> 12:04.797
Okay. Crooked cabinet door
is no longer crooked.

12:04.950 --> 12:06.391
Mmm. Eating and working.

12:06.542 --> 12:09.710
Mm-mm-mmm. All right,
what's next on the list?

12:09.730 --> 12:11.304
Oh. A text from Linda.

12:11.398 --> 12:14.507
"Don't eat the meatloaf,
we're saving it for dinner."

12:14.659 --> 12:15.716
What? No!

12:15.736 --> 12:17.143
Ah! I ate their dinner?

12:17.295 --> 12:19.479
Ah, God, what am I gonna do?

12:19.631 --> 12:21.981
Ah! Ah!
Think, Teddy, think.

12:22.133 --> 12:24.391
Uh, I could, uh, uh...

12:24.560 --> 12:28.137
Uh, I could... make another
meatloaf. Yes. Good plan.

12:28.156 --> 12:30.306
Okay.
Looking up meatloaf recipes.

12:30.399 --> 12:32.141
And I guess
I might as well finish this

12:32.160 --> 12:33.159
while I'm doing it.

12:33.311 --> 12:34.811
Oh, that's so good.

12:34.904 --> 12:37.146
Uh, where's your mom?

12:37.240 --> 12:39.406
Is she hiding behind the seats?
That's fun.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.000
Maybe she found a better car?

12:41.094 --> 12:42.927
-She's always wanted
a PT Cruiser.
-(phone chiming)

12:43.079 --> 12:44.654
Hold on,
I'm getting a bunch of texts.

12:44.672 --> 12:47.081
A lot of messages from Teddy.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.841
-Something about a meatloaf.
-GENE: Mmm.

12:48.935 --> 12:50.268
Oh, here's one from your mom.

12:50.419 --> 12:51.102
Oh, no.

12:51.254 --> 12:52.512
She went into the cemetery.

12:52.664 --> 12:54.088
She's in there
right now looking for us.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.607
-What?
-No!

12:55.792 --> 12:57.667
I'm trying to call her, but it's
going straight to voice mail.

12:57.760 --> 13:00.445
She's probably out of range.
Listen, kids...

13:00.672 --> 13:01.428
Don't say it, Dad.

13:01.615 --> 13:03.264
We got to go back
in the cemetery.

13:03.358 --> 13:04.783
-He said it.
-Dang it.

13:04.934 --> 13:06.175
We have to find your mom.

13:06.194 --> 13:07.601
First of all, we love her

13:07.695 --> 13:08.953
and we shouldn't abandon her.

13:09.180 --> 13:11.030
And second,
she's in the scariest place

13:11.182 --> 13:12.698
imaginable to her,
all by herself.

13:12.793 --> 13:14.942
Maybe it's not as bad as she
thought it was gonna be?

13:14.961 --> 13:15.960
(breathing heavily)

13:16.153 --> 13:17.186
(branch snaps)

13:17.355 --> 13:18.354
-Oh, my God!
-(crow cawing)

13:18.373 --> 13:19.689
Ah! Cemetery bird!

13:19.782 --> 13:23.026
Look, I know I couldn't find
my own mother's grave.

13:23.044 --> 13:25.044
But your mom
will be easier to find.

13:25.196 --> 13:26.379
I hope. I mean, she's louder.

13:26.531 --> 13:27.547
And then we'll leave

13:27.715 --> 13:30.475
and maybe we'll still be
able to snoob. Possibly.

13:30.626 --> 13:33.219
For 20 minutes or so, before
the snoobing place closes.

13:33.371 --> 13:34.387
But if we can't, at least

13:34.481 --> 13:36.055
this is your mom's fault
and not mine.

13:36.207 --> 13:37.732
Ah! Parents!

13:41.304 --> 13:43.321
Crap, where is your mom?
(exhales)

13:43.472 --> 13:46.049
Uh, you guys have
been quiet for a while.

13:46.067 --> 13:48.217
Is-is it 'cause,
instead of snoobing,

13:48.278 --> 13:50.403
we've been doing this so much?

13:50.555 --> 13:52.889
Hey. Snoobing is just a joyful
thing that kids do,

13:52.907 --> 13:55.683
but getting lost in a cemetery
in the cold is great, too.

13:55.760 --> 13:58.578
LOUISE:
(groans) We were gonna be
zooming down a hill

13:58.672 --> 14:00.396
on an inner tube, using gravity

14:00.415 --> 14:02.507
-for our own sick pleasures.
-BOB: I know.

14:02.734 --> 14:04.342
LOUISE:
And how are we supposed
to find Mom

14:04.493 --> 14:06.660
in a giant cemetery
with the sun going down?

14:06.754 --> 14:09.830
GENE:
Should we shake some keys
or bang on her food bowl?

14:09.850 --> 14:12.575
Oh, why is it getting
so dark out already?

14:12.668 --> 14:15.336
Stupid winter. And where
the hell is this grave?

14:15.355 --> 14:18.915
Okay, maybe I'll try reading
this terrible map one more time.

14:18.933 --> 14:20.917
Heritage Road and Cedar Lane.

14:21.052 --> 14:24.195
Huh. That gobbledygoop
kind of looks "Heritage."

14:24.347 --> 14:26.030
Oh, I'm close to Bob's mom.

14:26.107 --> 14:27.365
Guys! I'm close!

14:27.534 --> 14:29.759
Oh, sorry. Sorry.
Excuse me. Sorry.

14:29.852 --> 14:33.204
Okay, I put all the ingredients
in the bowl. What's next?

14:33.373 --> 14:36.357
"Knead everything together using
your hands." All right.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.784
Ahh! This is how you
make meatloaf?

14:38.937 --> 14:40.378
Ugh, oh, gross.

14:40.529 --> 14:42.939
But I got to do it.
Teddy, be strong.

14:43.032 --> 14:45.366
Ahh! Ugh! So slimy.

14:45.385 --> 14:49.387
Ohh! Ugh, Bob and Linda are
disgusting. Ugh, ugh.

14:49.538 --> 14:52.115
Well, the sun went down.
Damn sun.

14:52.133 --> 14:53.783
Sorry, sun, it's not your fault.

14:53.876 --> 14:55.785
Guys, I-I know
I keep saying this,

14:55.803 --> 14:59.063
but I really am sorry that
this day is a total failure.

14:59.215 --> 15:01.382
Hold on.
Maybe not a total failure.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.735
What if we snoob right here?

15:03.962 --> 15:04.885
I'm listening.

15:04.979 --> 15:06.295
Look at how steep this hill is.

15:06.314 --> 15:07.980
We can slide down
on our bellies.

15:08.133 --> 15:09.132
-Belly-tube.
-Boob.

15:09.150 --> 15:11.150
-Yes.
-I like it, I like it.

15:11.302 --> 15:13.469
Kids, you can't,
we need to find your mom

15:13.488 --> 15:15.154
before they
lock up the cemetery.

15:15.306 --> 15:16.806
Come on, Dad.
Just a little boobing?

15:16.899 --> 15:19.083
-TINA and GENE: Please?
-Please? Please, please, please?

15:19.252 --> 15:20.643
(sighs) Okay, fine.

15:20.662 --> 15:22.921
Just a little bit.
And then w-we go save your mom.

15:23.072 --> 15:24.313
-Yes!
-Yeah.

15:24.407 --> 15:27.650
Ready? One, two, three, go!

15:27.669 --> 15:29.969
♪ ♪

15:43.276 --> 15:45.518
-Yeah!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

15:45.670 --> 15:49.113
My wedgie's never been bigger
and I've never felt more alive.

15:49.265 --> 15:51.783
Pretty sure this is the spot.
(grunting)

15:51.934 --> 15:52.951
(Linda gasps)

15:53.178 --> 15:56.012
Oh, my God.
Bob's mom. I found you.

15:56.030 --> 15:57.363
Where the heck are Bob
and the kids?

15:57.515 --> 16:00.016
Did the cemetery eat them?
I hope not.

16:00.109 --> 16:01.350
No, right?

16:01.444 --> 16:05.204
Uh, so, I'm Linda,
your daughter-in-law.

16:05.356 --> 16:08.207
Sorry this is the first time
we're meeting.

16:08.359 --> 16:09.859
I wish we met
when you were alive,

16:09.877 --> 16:11.285
but I didn't know Bob back then.

16:11.304 --> 16:14.697
Ah, I don't know why I get
so afraid of cemeteries.

16:14.790 --> 16:17.475
I mean, you're here all the time
and you're not complaining.

16:17.644 --> 16:21.795
I guess maybe part
of that is cemeteries

16:21.889 --> 16:23.314
kind of make me think about,

16:23.541 --> 16:26.542
you know, losing someone close
to me, like how Bob lost you.

16:26.561 --> 16:30.046
But hey, I got to tell you,
you made a good guy.

16:30.139 --> 16:32.231
Bob's sweet, he's a great dad.

16:32.383 --> 16:33.974
He always remembers
to put the toilet seat down

16:33.994 --> 16:35.476
in the middle of the night.

16:35.495 --> 16:37.903
Except that one time,
when I fell in. That was bad.

16:38.056 --> 16:39.405
-(whoops)
-I like boobing,

16:39.499 --> 16:41.774
but it's a little hard
on my actual boobs.

16:41.926 --> 16:43.001
Mine are comfortably numb.

16:43.228 --> 16:44.502
I think that's what
that song is about.

16:44.729 --> 16:47.079
You could just go down on
your side. A little side boob.

16:47.232 --> 16:48.564
Guys, I'm glad
you're all having fun,

16:48.583 --> 16:50.041
but I-I think we need
to get back

16:50.193 --> 16:52.176
to finding your possibly
terrified mom.

16:52.328 --> 16:53.569
TINA:
Wow, yeah, it got dark.

16:53.662 --> 16:55.346
LOUISE: There's no way
Mom's still here.

16:55.498 --> 16:57.849
She probably left us
and found a family

16:58.000 --> 17:00.243
that doesn't
wander around in cemeteries.

17:00.261 --> 17:02.261
Yeah, she's probably back
at the car. So, let's go.

17:02.355 --> 17:03.763
LINDA:
Can you believe it?

17:03.857 --> 17:05.431
-Ah!
-Is that... Mom?

17:05.583 --> 17:08.084
It's either Mom or a
talking bird that's loving life.

17:08.102 --> 17:09.027
-Lin?
-LINDA: Bob?

17:09.178 --> 17:10.253
Lin? Where are you?

17:10.271 --> 17:11.937
LINDA:
I'm at your mom's grave.

17:12.014 --> 17:13.214
Where are you?

17:13.274 --> 17:15.349
Just stay there.
We'll come to you.

17:15.368 --> 17:17.518
Keep saying stuff,
we'll follow your voice.

17:17.537 --> 17:20.854
LINDA:
Okay. Na-na-na-na-na-na.

17:20.948 --> 17:22.206
She's coming from over there.

17:22.358 --> 17:24.116
-LINDA: Na-na-na-na.
-Lin.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.601
Na-na-na-na-na-na.

17:25.620 --> 17:27.378
TINA: Okay, yeah,
we all see each other.

17:27.530 --> 17:29.272
-Na-na-na-na-na.
-TINA: So, you don't have
to do that anymore.

17:29.290 --> 17:31.274
Not that we don't all love it.

17:31.292 --> 17:32.608
Where have you guys been?

17:32.701 --> 17:34.385
Oh, wait, that-that must be
the groundskeeper.

17:34.537 --> 17:36.220
I-I guess we should
flag him down?

17:36.447 --> 17:38.556
Dad, no. He's gonna
make us leave.

17:38.707 --> 17:40.874
We finally made it
to Grandma's grave.

17:40.968 --> 17:42.376
You need to have your visit.

17:42.470 --> 17:44.878
And maybe we want to have
a visit with Grandma, too.

17:44.898 --> 17:46.138
Okay. All right.

17:46.232 --> 17:47.957
What are you doing?
Come over here.

17:48.050 --> 17:50.568
-The truck is getting closer.
-Quick, hide.

17:50.719 --> 17:52.219
(quietly):
Okay. Lin, hide.

17:52.238 --> 17:53.629
Huh? Why are we hiding?

17:53.722 --> 17:55.573
Because the ghosts are coming?
Oh, God. Oh, God.

17:55.724 --> 17:57.391
No, we got to hide
from the groundskeeper.

17:57.410 --> 17:58.818
It-it's a long story,
I'll tell you later.

17:58.894 --> 18:00.244
Just hide, quick, please.

18:00.396 --> 18:02.305
-Oh, okay.
-LOUISE: I love how
Mom will hide

18:02.323 --> 18:05.083
from any authority figure
under any circumstance.

18:05.234 --> 18:07.159
Oh, yeah. She'd take him out
if we told her to.

18:07.328 --> 18:09.145
-What? We're taking him out?
-No. No, no, no.

18:09.163 --> 18:10.445
Okay, no one move.

18:10.447 --> 18:11.831
I'm just gonna pick
a wedgie real quick.

18:11.983 --> 18:13.149
-Tina, no.
-I'm doing it.

18:13.167 --> 18:14.592
Ah, I did it.
Oh, it's already back.

18:18.323 --> 18:20.356
So we're hiding from
groundskeepers? I like it.

18:20.416 --> 18:22.825
I'm glad it's not ghosts.
No offense, ghosts.

18:22.918 --> 18:24.343
So, where the heck have
you guys been?

18:24.495 --> 18:26.679
We got really lost.
And then we got lost again.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.589
You should've gotten a map
from that little lodge.

18:28.608 --> 18:31.167
It's an office,
it's not a lodge. And we did.

18:31.185 --> 18:33.018
-Oh.
-Can you be map-blind?

18:33.113 --> 18:34.837
Because if so, Dad's that.

18:34.930 --> 18:36.197
Shh. Here he comes.

18:40.178 --> 18:41.193
Go around the bush.

18:41.346 --> 18:43.663
(grunting, straining)

18:46.033 --> 18:47.291
Oh, thank God.

18:47.443 --> 18:50.035
Wow. Lin, I can't believe
you're in a cemetery.

18:50.130 --> 18:52.130
In the dark.
And you were by yourself.

18:52.357 --> 18:53.798
Well, not really.
I was with your mom.

18:53.967 --> 18:54.966
We had a nice talk.

18:55.193 --> 18:56.359
I mean, I did the talking.

18:56.377 --> 18:58.285
And it helped me relax,
a little.

18:58.379 --> 19:00.045
Also, I was picturing myself

19:00.198 --> 19:01.714
-in Jamaica the whole time.
-Hmm.

19:01.866 --> 19:06.051
So, here we are. Bob's mom,
these are your grandchildren.

19:06.204 --> 19:07.461
The ones I was
telling you about.

19:07.555 --> 19:08.537
-Hi.
-Hey, you.

19:08.556 --> 19:11.040
Uh, hi, Grandma.
We made you cards.

19:11.133 --> 19:12.208
We're not allowed
to leave them here,

19:12.301 --> 19:14.134
but we can show them to you.

19:14.154 --> 19:15.394
Here's mine. Pretty good, huh?

19:15.546 --> 19:17.304
Be easy on Louise and Gene.
They tried.

19:17.514 --> 19:19.306
Bob, move closer.

19:19.325 --> 19:21.066
And maybe change your face

19:21.219 --> 19:23.310
so it's not so "I'm Bob,
I'm a terrible person"?

19:23.404 --> 19:27.314
Yep, yep, no, I-I know.
I-I-I just, yeah.

19:27.408 --> 19:30.409
Listen. I think I know your mom
well enough to know

19:30.561 --> 19:32.486
that she would be okay with you
not coming till now.

19:32.505 --> 19:35.155
Because she'd want you
to be busy living your life,

19:35.175 --> 19:36.823
with your three
beautiful children,

19:36.918 --> 19:38.492
and your fun, hot wife Linda.

19:38.511 --> 19:41.404
And she'd be so proud of you.
I mean, look what you've done.

19:41.422 --> 19:43.181
With the restaurant,
with this family.

19:43.408 --> 19:44.998
-Tina, take your
hand out of your butt.
-Sorry.

19:45.018 --> 19:46.075
Thanks, Lin.

19:46.093 --> 19:47.167
Okay, kids, step back.

19:47.261 --> 19:49.078
You're hogging Grandma.

19:49.096 --> 19:51.355
BOB:
Hi, Mom.

19:52.266 --> 19:53.582
TINA:
That was a nice visit.

19:53.601 --> 19:54.525
Until Gene farted.

19:54.752 --> 19:56.343
It wasn't me,
it was a cemetery ghost.

19:56.362 --> 19:57.253
It was me.

19:57.346 --> 19:58.921
BOB:
Yeah, we're locked in.

19:58.940 --> 20:01.974
He did say he was gonna do that
and then I guess he did it.

20:02.126 --> 20:03.776
Good for him
for following through.

20:03.928 --> 20:05.277
So, uh, what do we do?

20:05.430 --> 20:07.263
(sighs)
I don't know. Maybe we...

20:07.281 --> 20:08.614
Oh, your mom's
already climbing the fence.

20:08.708 --> 20:11.600
Let's get the hell out of here.
Come on, come on.

20:11.602 --> 20:12.768
TINA:
Ah, coming.

20:12.787 --> 20:14.045
Ah, first boobing and now

20:14.196 --> 20:15.379
climbing a cemetery fence?

20:15.531 --> 20:17.048
Is this the best night ever?

20:17.199 --> 20:18.123
-(cloth ripping)
-Ah, my snow pants.

20:18.276 --> 20:19.866
Well, no more wedgie, I guess.

20:19.886 --> 20:22.220
Wait, I'm not sure if I can
climb this without a boost.

20:22.447 --> 20:24.055
-TINA: Ghost boost?
-GENE: Who you gonna call?

20:24.131 --> 20:25.448
LOUISE:
Ghost boosters!

20:25.466 --> 20:26.799
LINDA: Oh, God,
I'm getting in the car!

20:26.951 --> 20:28.559
Eh, looks pretty good.

20:28.711 --> 20:31.378
Not exactly like the one
I ate, but not bad.

20:31.472 --> 20:33.456
Anyway, they're gonna be
really surprised

20:33.474 --> 20:35.641
-that's it's hot
out of the oven.
-Teddy?

20:35.735 --> 20:37.142
Ahh! Oh, jeez.

20:37.237 --> 20:39.720
Oh, my God. Uh, uh...

20:39.814 --> 20:42.798
Go back outside for an hour and
a half and-and then come back.

20:42.891 --> 20:44.391
