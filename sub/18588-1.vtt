WEBVTT

00:31.280 --> 00:33.400
Visit Santa's grotto!

00:33.440 --> 00:35.440
SHE SCREAMS

00:37.280 --> 00:39.280
HE LAUGHS

00:50.480 --> 00:52.640
You look a right muffin, you. Ssh!

00:52.640 --> 00:56.120
Don't talk to me.
I'm a stranger round here.

00:56.160 --> 00:58.800
Are you hiding from her
boyfriend again?

00:58.800 --> 01:01.640
I've told her she should go back to
him cos when you get to know him

01:01.680 --> 01:04.480
he's really very...big.

01:04.519 --> 01:06.040
Here you are.

01:07.440 --> 01:13.120
Oh, look, there's the Black Widow
with that poor fly.

01:13.160 --> 01:15.760
Smile, Mr Newbold.

01:15.760 --> 01:18.080
No, that's not good. Put it away!

01:18.080 --> 01:20.720
Looks as if it's on the wrong face.

01:22.840 --> 01:25.600
It's you she fancies.
He's just for practice.

01:28.880 --> 01:32.520
Oh, good day to you, Mrs Bridges.

01:32.520 --> 01:35.760
You said that yesterday
and it wasn't.

01:35.800 --> 01:39.000
Oh, is there a man anywhere
you can rely on?

01:39.000 --> 01:43.480
You give them your best years,
smarten up your underwear,

01:43.480 --> 01:46.120
totter about in crippling heels

01:46.120 --> 01:50.200
and still they leave you
empty, broken.

01:50.200 --> 01:53.640
Is that it? Is that life?

01:53.640 --> 01:56.720
Is that all there is?

01:56.720 --> 01:59.720
I've got some nice fresh kidneys.

02:46.480 --> 02:48.520
Ole!

02:49.720 --> 02:52.320
It's getting more like
a bullfight with this till.

02:52.320 --> 02:53.600
Did you see that?

02:53.600 --> 02:56.400
This time in the morning you
think people can see?

02:58.040 --> 03:01.600
I think it's Arkwright
having a laugh.

03:01.640 --> 03:05.960
He's deadly when he's playful.
You ask Nurse Gladys Emmanuel.

03:08.200 --> 03:10.560
Oh, good morning, Gastric.

03:10.600 --> 03:13.240
Morning. Right, I want...

03:14.920 --> 03:17.520
Why's he dressed like a pillock?

03:20.880 --> 03:24.000
It's not me. I'm out.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.680
Anyway, you owe me 10p
from yesterday. How come?

03:26.680 --> 03:30.800
Well, actually it's 11p, but I'm
giving you favoured customer rates.

03:30.840 --> 03:32.560
It's about time!

03:32.560 --> 03:35.640
Well, don't tell anybody else
cos they'll all want it.

03:35.640 --> 03:39.280
I've forgotten it already,
along with what I came in for.

03:40.480 --> 03:42.200
I'll have to come back.

03:42.200 --> 03:44.160
Eh? No!

03:44.160 --> 03:47.360
Heck, now look what you've done.
You've lost us a customer!

03:47.400 --> 03:51.040
He said he'll be back. Yes, I know,
but they lie, don't they?

03:51.040 --> 03:53.720
Right, I want two pound of bacon.

03:53.720 --> 03:57.160
Two pound of bacon.
A dozen eggs. A dozen eggs.

03:57.160 --> 03:59.360
A large tin of beans.
Large tin of be...

03:59.360 --> 04:02.400
You know, Gastric, I'm glad you got
your appetite back.

04:02.400 --> 04:06.520
I mean, Gastric and diet were two
words that don't really go together.

04:06.520 --> 04:09.760
It's not just for me. I've got
Cliff Bridges staying with me.

04:09.760 --> 04:13.200
Elsie's husband. Mrs Bridges.

04:13.200 --> 04:15.640
Oh, yes! I thought he'd left her?

04:15.640 --> 04:19.120
Oh, he's left her three times
altogether but now he's come back

04:19.120 --> 04:20.720
just in time for Christmas.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.920
So he's brought himself back,
has he?

04:22.920 --> 04:25.360
Well, it saves him buying
a Christmas present, I suppose,

04:25.400 --> 04:27.200
doesn't it?

04:27.240 --> 04:30.440
He must pack some romantic punch
if he gets away with that.

04:30.440 --> 04:34.520
Oh, not this time. She won't let him
in. She's thrown him back out.

04:34.520 --> 04:38.160
I've taken him in
temporarily for a while.

04:38.200 --> 04:41.840
I thought I might pick up a few
pointers about how to handle Madge.

04:43.560 --> 04:46.280
Oh, Mrs Bridges, eh? Poor lass.

04:46.320 --> 04:49.000
I thought she looked
a bit emotional yesterday.

04:49.040 --> 04:52.080
She's always emotional.
She cries when anything dies.

04:52.080 --> 04:54.280
Well, there's no harm in that.

04:54.280 --> 04:56.400
Her battery?!

05:00.000 --> 05:02.560
He comes home for Christmas
and she won't even let him in.

05:02.560 --> 05:05.000
How Christmassy is that?

05:05.000 --> 05:08.040
Women!
Where do they learn this behaviour?

05:08.040 --> 05:10.480
Are they born nasty?

05:10.480 --> 05:12.600
Elsie's not nasty...

05:12.600 --> 05:15.040
compared to some I could mention.

05:15.040 --> 05:17.360
It's hardly Good King Wenceslas.

05:17.360 --> 05:21.240
A poor man comes inside
and all she gives him is grief.

05:21.240 --> 05:23.360
Then she shoves him
straight back out

05:23.360 --> 05:25.720
into the deep and crisp and even.

05:25.720 --> 05:29.560
He's left her more than once
and always for some other woman.

05:29.560 --> 05:31.480
Well, there you go.

05:31.480 --> 05:34.640
It's not as if he didn't have
a good reason.

05:34.680 --> 05:37.000
She's taken him back twice.

05:37.040 --> 05:39.720
I don't think mine would show
that kind of consideration.

05:39.720 --> 05:42.360
What's he like, this Bridges fella?

05:42.360 --> 05:45.120
Are we talking good looking,
athletic?

05:45.120 --> 05:47.760
Unfair competition?

05:47.760 --> 05:51.200
Obviously he has some pull
with the ladies.

05:51.240 --> 05:53.320
I don't like him already.

05:58.720 --> 06:04.320
Oh, get a grip, Elsie. Have
a good sing. Take your mind off him.

06:04.320 --> 06:08.240
Forget him.
Repeat after me - "Cliff who?"

06:08.240 --> 06:12.360
Was he born at the seaside?
Why did they call him after a cliff?

06:12.360 --> 06:14.880
His name's Clifford!

06:14.880 --> 06:17.920
It bears no relation to the seaside.

06:17.920 --> 06:21.840
Cliff to me is something you have
to be careful not to fall off.

06:21.880 --> 06:24.200
I think Elsie found that.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.160
Did he just appear at your doorway?

06:28.200 --> 06:31.200
With a suitcase and his washing.

06:31.200 --> 06:34.160
Three years of washing?!

06:34.160 --> 06:38.600
No, I think she must have
done her bit,

06:38.600 --> 06:42.080
although I don't believe
that was the attraction.

06:42.080 --> 06:45.720
I hope you didn't let him in.
No, I didn't let him in.

06:47.480 --> 06:49.840
Did it never occur to you to
set the dog on him?

06:51.360 --> 06:55.360
I don't have a dog. For the
occasion, I'd have borrowed one!

06:55.360 --> 06:56.840
You give them your best.

06:56.840 --> 06:59.120
Ah, now that's where you went
wrong, right there.

06:59.120 --> 07:01.600
They thrive better on less.

07:01.600 --> 07:05.080
Think of him as dead or living
somewhere similar,

07:05.120 --> 07:07.240
like Lancashire.

07:08.680 --> 07:11.760
And don't you be encouraging her
to take him back.

07:11.760 --> 07:15.200
He's all alone and it's Christmas.

07:15.200 --> 07:19.640
Oh, I can see him now out on
the street in a blizzard,

07:19.680 --> 07:22.720
trying to keep warm with only
a Mars bar.

07:22.720 --> 07:24.920
Why would he have a Mars bar?

07:24.920 --> 07:27.360
Because I would have
just given him one.

07:28.760 --> 07:32.720
You're as daft as Auntie Eileen.
She found love in the end.

07:32.760 --> 07:35.200
And we all know which end!

07:36.320 --> 07:38.240
Be firm, Elsie, don't weaken.

07:38.280 --> 07:40.160
I know it's Christmas,
goodwill to all men,

07:40.160 --> 07:44.040
but you're allowed to be nasty to
those closest to you.

07:44.040 --> 07:50.240
I AM being firm, even though his
coming back must mean something.

07:50.240 --> 07:53.200
It probably means the other
woman's chucked him out!

07:53.240 --> 07:56.720
Came straight home though,
didn't he?

07:56.720 --> 07:58.880
Oh, Elsie! Oh, Elsie!

08:00.800 --> 08:03.320
You're only guessing it's me.

08:03.360 --> 08:05.160
I could be a real elf.

08:05.200 --> 08:07.400
You're too tall.

08:07.440 --> 08:10.040
I've been stretched.

08:10.080 --> 08:11.480
I'm an elongated elf.

08:11.520 --> 08:13.680
My favourite kind.

08:13.680 --> 08:15.720
Have you got a name?

08:15.720 --> 08:17.440
Ginger.

08:17.440 --> 08:21.320
May I enquire where the bit
might be that's ginger?

08:26.600 --> 08:28.440
I'm looking forward
to a little session

08:28.480 --> 08:29.960
with the kid that works here.

08:29.960 --> 08:32.559
Me too!

08:32.600 --> 08:35.000
Was that him?
I'm not allowed to say,

08:35.039 --> 08:37.120
on the grounds of "elf" and safety!

08:43.039 --> 08:46.120
Do you often talk to strange elves?

08:46.120 --> 08:48.200
He's got a nice face.

08:48.200 --> 08:50.440
You ought to see it
first thing in the morning.

08:50.440 --> 08:52.480
Ready when he is.

08:57.400 --> 09:01.680
# Therefore, Christian men be sure

09:01.720 --> 09:05.480
# Wealth or rank possessing

09:05.480 --> 09:09.360
# Ye who now will bless the poor

09:09.360 --> 09:13.760
♪ Shall yourselves find blessing. ♪

09:16.040 --> 09:17.720
SHE SIGHS

09:17.760 --> 09:20.520
OK, well, a smidgeon better
than yesterday,

09:20.520 --> 09:23.760
but remember, we've got that choir
in Finkle Street to beat,

09:23.760 --> 09:26.680
otherwise they'll be
bragging all year!

09:26.720 --> 09:30.000
Go on, take ten.

09:30.040 --> 09:32.120
Were you singing?
Cos I couldn't hear you.

09:32.120 --> 09:34.600
I told you,
I'm not much for singing.

09:34.640 --> 09:37.800
Well, you didn't tell me you needed
a voice transplant.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
Get some expression into it.

09:42.040 --> 09:44.080
And try to look happy.

09:44.080 --> 09:47.440
They know we're an item. If you
don't look happy it reflects on me.

09:47.480 --> 09:49.200
You expect me to be happy?

09:49.200 --> 09:53.040
Until after the formal engagement
and then I'll settle for obedient.

09:53.080 --> 09:55.280
Engaged? You and me?

09:55.280 --> 09:59.000
Well, unless I get a better offer
you're in with a chance.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.360
Lots of goodies coming your way.

10:04.800 --> 10:08.160
Where's this collector
of ladies' scalps then?

10:08.200 --> 10:11.120
Oh, I couldn't dream.
Elsie goes ballistic.

10:11.160 --> 10:14.160
In that case,
he can't be all that magnetic.

10:14.160 --> 10:17.000
I don't see him any more
Leonardo DiCaprio than I am.

10:18.720 --> 10:20.640
Listen, I were at school with him.

10:20.640 --> 10:23.080
While the rest of us were
playing marbles,

10:23.120 --> 10:25.960
he were playing with the entire
girls' hockey team!

10:29.000 --> 10:32.520
I bet Elsie and Cliff have really
missed each other.

10:32.520 --> 10:35.480
I bet you still believe
in Father Christmas.

10:35.480 --> 10:37.720
Not always.

10:37.720 --> 10:42.360
I can't afford to keep him.
He eats like a woodchipper.

10:42.360 --> 10:46.480
Lost his wife but not his appetite.
How heartbroken is that?

10:46.520 --> 10:50.680
He's not lost her. She's trying to
be tough but she's wavering.

10:50.720 --> 10:53.760
His old magic is still working.

10:53.760 --> 10:56.480
It's magic the way
he goes through a bacon butty.

10:59.640 --> 11:02.640
The entire girls' hockey team?

11:02.680 --> 11:04.520
They'd have shin pads,

11:04.560 --> 11:07.160
but what protection would that
be against him?

11:07.160 --> 11:08.760
If I tried half that stuff
on with our lass,

11:08.760 --> 11:11.840
I'd be the one needing shin pads!

11:11.840 --> 11:14.880
If you want to have a look at him
I'll bring him in the shop.

11:14.880 --> 11:16.320
HE BURPS

11:16.320 --> 11:18.320
Two o'clock this afternoon.

11:26.080 --> 11:28.920
Right, what have we got here?

11:28.920 --> 11:32.160
"Dr Proctor's
Fiery Chest Pastilles."

11:32.160 --> 11:34.320
You can put them away.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.600
They never sold. Far too hot.

11:36.600 --> 11:39.000
It's like sucking a chilli.

11:39.040 --> 11:42.520
Well, maybe they've cooled down now
we've had 'em for a while.

11:43.800 --> 11:48.080
Plus they turned your tongue green.
Yeah, well, it wore off, didn't it?

11:48.080 --> 11:51.440
Anyway, we can tell them it was
a sign of inner purity.

11:52.960 --> 11:54.680
Right, come on, you try one.

11:54.680 --> 11:56.960
YOU try one! No, no, you try one.

11:56.960 --> 11:59.760
Oh, no, you... TRY ONE.

11:59.760 --> 12:01.800
All right, tell you what,
we'll both try one.

12:01.840 --> 12:04.840
We should always be familiar with
the products that we are selling,

12:04.840 --> 12:08.800
right, apart from a small selection
of ladies' underwear, OK?

12:11.000 --> 12:13.160
There you go.

12:17.040 --> 12:20.720
You better get that in your...

12:20.760 --> 12:23.120
All right, all right, all right.

12:32.480 --> 12:34.600
Oh. Oh.

12:34.640 --> 12:37.760
Yeah, they have.
They've cooled down.

12:37.760 --> 12:40.000
Used to bring
me out in clammy sweats.

12:40.040 --> 12:41.880
Black Widow does that to me.

12:43.520 --> 12:45.480
Hmm, yeah.

12:58.560 --> 13:01.320
It's when you get to the middle!

13:01.360 --> 13:04.480
You can clear drains with these
things, can't you?

13:22.640 --> 13:25.320
Stand there, Mr Newbold.
This is girl talk.

13:27.320 --> 13:29.560
You're looking a bit
female stressed.

13:29.600 --> 13:33.200
I'm getting older.
It can't last forever.

13:33.200 --> 13:35.840
Oh, there's better solutions
than being dead.

13:35.880 --> 13:38.080
Not as reliable.

13:38.080 --> 13:42.560
You need a few hours of all-male
company. Crack some jokes.

13:42.560 --> 13:45.840
A free flow of bad manners.
Spill a few drinks.

13:45.840 --> 13:49.880
Drop some crumbs down your front.
Belch a bit.

13:49.880 --> 13:53.520
It's true.
It's those little things you miss.

13:53.520 --> 13:57.000
First of all,
two o'clock at Arkwright's.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Let's get a look at this
Cliff Bridges.

13:59.040 --> 14:03.160
The man with power over women.
Pick up a few tips.

14:03.160 --> 14:05.920
Not that we need any help
in that direction.

14:05.960 --> 14:08.040
I think that's understood.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.680
HE PANTS

14:17.680 --> 14:20.720
Guaranteed to clear
all your passages.

14:32.320 --> 14:34.680
You do know it's bad luck,
don't you,

14:34.720 --> 14:38.240
standing out here practising
not spending?

14:38.240 --> 14:41.960
Just browsing. Just happened to be
coming in your direction.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.960
Here, what time have you got?

14:46.960 --> 14:50.600
Well, does it matter? You're not
doing anything with it, are you?

14:51.960 --> 14:55.080
Are we late? For what?
Well, I don't know.

14:55.080 --> 14:58.920
Mr Newbold said we had to get
a move on. I didn't say a word.

14:58.920 --> 15:02.960
He's so forgetful. I forget when I
last got the CHANCE to say a word!

15:02.960 --> 15:05.640
Listen to him rattling on.
Do be quiet, Mr Newbold.

15:05.640 --> 15:08.280
People are going to think
you're a chatterbox.

15:11.760 --> 15:14.600
Hey, we've got quite a crowd
building now, haven't we?

15:14.640 --> 15:18.400
You must have all heard about
my special offers.

15:18.400 --> 15:21.040
Just passing. I'll take some.

15:21.040 --> 15:22.840
You don't even know what they are!

15:22.880 --> 15:24.920
I like surprises.

15:30.240 --> 15:33.320
What's all this then?
Have I missed something?

15:33.360 --> 15:35.880
Not a lot,
by the look of that lipstick.

15:35.880 --> 15:39.480
I turned a corner, walked straight
into this pair of lips.

15:39.520 --> 15:42.200
Which corner?

15:42.240 --> 15:45.240
Here comes Gastric's mini.
HORN BEEPS

15:45.280 --> 15:46.240
Hey up!

15:48.280 --> 15:49.920
What's going on?

15:53.760 --> 15:56.520
THEY GASP

15:56.520 --> 15:58.440
THEY SIGH

15:58.440 --> 16:00.280
Now, listen, you lot,

16:00.280 --> 16:04.320
if you're not going to buy anything
there will be a parking fee,

16:04.360 --> 16:07.160
refundable upon your first purchase.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.240
THEY GASP

16:11.240 --> 16:13.480
THEY SIGH

16:13.480 --> 16:15.920
Hey up, it's Black Friday.

16:17.120 --> 16:19.160
Where is he? God's gift to women.

16:19.160 --> 16:23.440
Cliff Bridges. He's adjusting his
cap in the rear-view mirror.

16:23.440 --> 16:25.760
He'll be here in a minute.

16:25.760 --> 16:28.840
So THAT'S what this is
all about, is it?

16:28.880 --> 16:31.760
You all want to see Mr Magnificent.

16:33.400 --> 16:35.600
THEY GASP

16:38.280 --> 16:40.360
You've got to be kidding!

16:41.880 --> 16:42.920
What?

16:46.400 --> 16:48.600
He reminded me of someone
and he was dead!

16:50.120 --> 16:52.280
Maybe he's got a big personality?

16:52.280 --> 16:55.520
He's not big enough to have
a big personality.

16:55.520 --> 16:58.760
If I were you I'd ask for
your Mars bar back.

16:58.760 --> 17:01.200
Who in their right mind would
take him back?

17:01.200 --> 17:03.640
He's hardly fit for recycling.

17:03.680 --> 17:06.720
Makes your man look good.
I wouldn't go as far as good.

17:08.160 --> 17:10.319
There's been some wear
and tear in there.

17:10.319 --> 17:11.880
No wonder he's ready for home.

17:11.880 --> 17:14.000
Home? I wouldn't have him delivered!

17:15.720 --> 17:20.720
So you've left Elsie three times?
Anybody can make a mistake.

17:20.720 --> 17:22.160
What, three times?!

17:22.160 --> 17:27.040
Same mistake. Mmm. You don't look
like a lady-killer, Clifford.

17:27.079 --> 17:31.880
You look more like his grandad.
I've retired.

17:31.880 --> 17:36.080
All right, from the horse's mouth,
what's the secret?

17:36.120 --> 17:39.000
He keeps asking me that.
On behalf of a friend.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.880
All right, so he keeps asking.
What do you tell him?

17:43.880 --> 17:47.880
I tell him I don't know.
Anyway, that's all in the past.

17:47.920 --> 17:51.880
Dr Proctor's Fiery Chest Pastilles?

17:51.880 --> 17:54.040
Haven't seen these in a while.

17:54.040 --> 17:56.280
I used to swear by these.

18:09.080 --> 18:11.120
Oh, hello, Mavis.

18:11.160 --> 18:12.600
Hello, Granville.

18:12.600 --> 18:15.960
What are we doing for Christmas?
We did that last year.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.640
Wasn't it a lovely Christmas?

18:20.680 --> 18:24.920
I shan't enjoy this Christmas if
poor Mr Bridges can't get home.

18:24.920 --> 18:28.360
You're such a
kind-hearted woman, Mavis,

18:28.360 --> 18:32.000
but Elsie is surrounded
by the female Mafia.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.840
They're all telling her
to send him packing.

18:34.840 --> 18:39.120
I don't think there's anybody going
to be able to get him back.

18:39.120 --> 18:41.560
I bet you could.

18:41.560 --> 18:43.840
If anyone can...

18:43.880 --> 18:45.920
Oh.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.840
FROM INSIDE BOX: Ow! Ah! Ooh!

18:51.880 --> 18:53.960
She'll only throw him out again.

18:53.960 --> 18:55.640
Even now he's gift-wrapped.

18:55.680 --> 19:00.040
Once he's inside the house, he'll be
able to work his magic, won't he?

19:00.040 --> 19:03.120
He's not sounding all that
magical at the moment.

19:03.120 --> 19:04.520
Stop moaning, will you?

19:04.520 --> 19:08.960
We're trying to get you back to
where you want to be. Ow! Ah!

19:09.000 --> 19:10.600
Oh, it's no good.

19:10.600 --> 19:13.880
Open the lid, will you,
let's see what he's grizzling about?

19:15.560 --> 19:16.800
Ah!

19:18.920 --> 19:20.360
Oh, 'eck!

19:24.720 --> 19:26.520
When she opens the box, Mr Bridges,

19:26.520 --> 19:30.120
my advice is to grab her while
she's too surprised to speak.

19:30.120 --> 19:32.320
Give her your best shot.

19:37.240 --> 19:38.960
Parcel for Bridges.

19:51.840 --> 19:54.000
She should have opened it by now.

19:54.040 --> 19:57.040
He should be out of the box.

19:57.040 --> 20:00.280
Unless he's dragged her in.
She's not complaining.

20:00.320 --> 20:03.720
He's done it again,
that old hockey magic!

20:03.720 --> 20:06.680
I think you're right,
I think he's cracked it!

20:06.680 --> 20:08.480
He's still got it, eh?

20:08.480 --> 20:10.120
I wonder if he keeps his cap on.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.680
She dumped me and kept the box.

20:20.080 --> 20:23.120
She's got them women with her.
They threw me out the back.

20:25.880 --> 20:27.040
You blew it!

20:27.080 --> 20:29.360
Where was all this magic?

20:29.400 --> 20:33.080
I just want to go home.
I'm all out of magic.

20:33.080 --> 20:34.800
And I'm all out of bacon.

20:36.720 --> 20:39.000
Can I ask you please
not to repeat that?

20:39.040 --> 20:41.080
I've been telling everybody
it's down to

20:41.080 --> 20:44.040
Dr Proctor's Fiery Chest Pastilles.

20:45.560 --> 20:46.560
We need a plan B.

21:07.840 --> 21:11.360
This forgotten secret
from the Victorian era

21:11.400 --> 21:13.680
has to be handled with care.

21:13.680 --> 21:16.960
I mean, are you ready for
this much power over women?

21:19.040 --> 21:21.400
You're going to have
to pace yourselves.

21:21.440 --> 21:22.400
We're ready.

21:24.640 --> 21:28.120
I think I can safely speak
also for my colleague here.

21:28.120 --> 21:32.640
Providing it's the genuine stuff
Cliff Bridges has been using.

21:32.680 --> 21:34.160
To such effect.

21:34.200 --> 21:39.160
And providing it will prove to
have a similar effect upon us.

21:40.280 --> 21:42.560
Within reason.

21:42.600 --> 21:45.240
Nobody's talking an entire
ladies' hockey team.

21:49.080 --> 21:52.320
Tom Jones has a pack of
these at his bedside.

21:54.160 --> 21:57.520
He always sucks two
when he sings Delilah.

22:00.840 --> 22:03.880
And if you listen carefully,
you can hear the whisper

22:03.880 --> 22:06.520
of ladies' underwear
as it sails past.

22:08.760 --> 22:12.040
Today, Tom Jones.
Tomorrow, Eric and Cyril.

22:15.160 --> 22:18.440
So how come these are
not more widely known?

22:18.480 --> 22:20.160
Oh, because they were banned,
you see,

22:20.200 --> 22:23.400
once they found out that they
started the First World War.

22:24.800 --> 22:28.040
I thought it was because some
archduke got himself shot...

22:28.040 --> 22:29.080
in the Balkans.

22:31.800 --> 22:34.240
Yes, and very painful it was, too.

22:35.760 --> 22:39.200
But you've got to ask yourself,
why was he shot?

22:39.240 --> 22:43.680
He was shot because he was doing
a bit of archduking on the side,

22:43.680 --> 22:45.960
you know, he was running
amok with his Dr Proctor's.

22:48.120 --> 22:51.720
So, if they're banned,
where did you get these?

22:51.760 --> 22:55.880
They were from a secret hoard that
was buried in the grounds of

22:55.920 --> 22:59.680
the lodge of the Royal Antediluvian
Order of Buffaloes.

23:00.800 --> 23:02.000
Near Macclesfield.

23:08.480 --> 23:11.240
The men still need to
give it some...oomph.

23:11.280 --> 23:14.760
It's not something I'd
encourage in Mr Newbold.

23:14.760 --> 23:16.800
You've got to let them
loose sometime.

23:16.800 --> 23:20.400
But you have to be careful, in case
they turn out to be ravening wolves.

23:20.440 --> 23:22.680
I think you're safe enough
with Mr Newbold.

23:26.560 --> 23:31.520
Hey, let's get this thing over
with and then, er...

23:31.520 --> 23:33.640
we can go and make
some magic together.

23:33.680 --> 23:35.360
You've got to pick my mother up.

23:37.520 --> 23:40.760
You'll regret this when
I'm irresistible to women.

23:40.800 --> 23:42.200
There'll be a queue.

23:42.200 --> 23:44.000
Maybe if you were at a bus stop.

23:45.240 --> 23:48.800
Right, places, everybody.

23:48.800 --> 23:50.640
Clear your throats.

23:50.680 --> 23:55.000
Get all your coughs and sneezes over
with. This is our last rehearsal.

23:55.000 --> 23:59.360
Let's make it a good 'un.
Come on, open your books.

23:59.400 --> 24:03.920
We ought to go see Uncle Gerald.
Again? Oh, he doesn't recognise us.

24:03.960 --> 24:06.680
Well, he knows when it's mealtimes.

24:06.680 --> 24:08.000
He thought I was German.

24:09.640 --> 24:11.840
Well, you CAN be a bit
that way inclined.

24:13.480 --> 24:16.920
Stay there, Mr Newbold.
I'll soon be back at your side.

24:18.560 --> 24:21.000
I'm beginning to feel
she's at both sides.

24:22.400 --> 24:25.200
Granville, you're
a man of experience.

24:25.240 --> 24:27.600
I'd like you to come upstairs
to my bedroom

24:27.640 --> 24:30.240
and take a look at a damp patch.

24:36.640 --> 24:40.280
I think you'll need a builder
for that, Mrs Featherstone.

24:40.280 --> 24:44.120
Come and look at my damp patch,
Granville. We can build on that.

24:48.840 --> 24:53.880
Come along, people.
Let's get this show on the road.

24:53.920 --> 24:55.320
SHE SIGHS

24:55.320 --> 24:58.560
Hey, so where's this lad of yours?

24:58.600 --> 25:03.560
Ooh! Well, the last time I saw him,
he was, er, dressed as an elf.

25:06.120 --> 25:07.440
Ooh!

25:07.480 --> 25:09.120
Right, take those glasses off!

25:11.200 --> 25:13.360
You can wrap this up for
Christmas, and all.

25:14.760 --> 25:17.640
Take your hands off my husband.

25:17.640 --> 25:19.680
Look at me, Norm.

25:19.680 --> 25:21.920
You're not fit to be loose.

25:21.920 --> 25:24.080
And stop grinning!

25:24.120 --> 25:26.680
You've got some grovelling to do!

25:34.120 --> 25:37.560
You look like you might
be a baritone.

25:37.560 --> 25:40.000
Well, I'm no soprano.

25:40.000 --> 25:44.200
Hmm. Good. Give it some volume.

25:44.200 --> 25:45.680
Hey, what have you got there?

25:49.960 --> 25:53.400
It clears all your passages. Oh!

25:53.400 --> 25:57.080
Do you want a throat pastille,
everyone? It clears your passages.

25:58.920 --> 26:02.880
We need all the help we can get if
we're going to beat Finkle Street.
