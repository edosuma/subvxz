<i>Who the hell are you?</i>

00:57.914 --> 01:00.381
- Siobhan.
- Stay the fuck away from me.

01:02.719 --> 01:06.254
You played us.
Me, Brock... Emmett?

01:06.306 --> 01:08.139
Everything about you is a lie.

01:10.477 --> 01:13.864
- Siobhan, listen to me.
- Don't.

01:15.398 --> 01:17.982
Okay. Okay.

01:18.902 --> 01:20.351
<i>Okay...</i>

01:22.238 --> 01:23.688
Put the gun down.

01:29.946 --> 01:32.597
- It's me, Siobhan.
- No...

01:34.701 --> 01:39.203
You hear me?
It's me.

01:41.207 --> 01:42.924
<i>Come on.</i>

01:44.878 --> 01:46.644
It's just me.

01:46.645 --> 01:48.763
There is no you.

01:49.966 --> 01:52.683
<i>There is no you.</i>

01:54.187 --> 01:55.937
There is no you!

03:35.371 --> 03:36.871
I need time to think. Just get out.

03:36.906 --> 03:40.592
- We should talk about this.
- Get the fuck out!

03:41.044 --> 03:42.660
Now!

04:21.868 --> 04:24.619
- Hey, good evening.
- Where's Mario and Frank?

04:24.671 --> 04:28.172
Oh, um, they had to do
a double at Raymor Plaza.

04:28.208 --> 04:30.091
Some kind of plumbing leak.

04:30.126 --> 04:32.627
They're up to their
eyeballs in shit, literally.

04:32.679 --> 04:34.879
- Yeah.
- Give me your badges.

04:34.931 --> 04:37.298
We already scanned them.

04:37.350 --> 04:39.016
And I'm gonna scan them again.

04:39.052 --> 04:40.801
Excuse my friend.

04:40.853 --> 04:43.054
He's a little slow since the accident.

04:46.693 --> 04:49.110
What? Something wrong?

04:49.145 --> 04:50.728
Why'd you cut your hair, man?

04:50.730 --> 04:52.396
What?

04:53.399 --> 04:54.782
The 'fro.

04:59.539 --> 05:01.572
You know, just hanging
around guys like this,

05:01.574 --> 05:05.326
it just felt too much like showing off.

05:06.412 --> 05:07.628
Thanks.

05:07.664 --> 05:09.880
Have a good night.

05:09.916 --> 05:12.083
Yeah, thank you. You, too.

05:26.182 --> 05:28.683
Okay.

05:45.368 --> 05:47.418
Big Brother's in the house.

05:48.621 --> 05:50.788
You seeing what I'm seeing?

05:50.840 --> 05:53.424
Shit, they're watching
them monitors like hawks.

05:53.459 --> 05:55.960
Then let's change the view.

06:00.300 --> 06:02.016
All right.

06:02.051 --> 06:05.803
<i>Okay, you're clear. Go get that formula.</i>

06:05.855 --> 06:09.440
<i>- It's an algorithm.
- Yeah, you say tomato.</i>

06:46.512 --> 06:48.179
<i>Hey, one of the
guards is on the move.</i>

06:48.231 --> 06:50.598
<i>- You better step on it.
- You need to step off it.</i>

06:50.650 --> 06:53.317
I ain't watching fucking
YouTube videos up in here.

06:54.937 --> 06:56.904
Damn, he's getting on the elevator.

07:00.526 --> 07:02.026
Sh...

07:04.947 --> 07:06.330
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:06.366 --> 07:08.699
- Where's your partner?
- Oh, he went to take a leak.

07:08.751 --> 07:11.369
You know?

07:13.373 --> 07:15.873
<i>Look, you better step on it, man.</i>

07:15.925 --> 07:18.008
Gonna get real crowded
in there real soon.

07:18.044 --> 07:20.544
Got you.

07:20.596 --> 07:21.962
Job.

07:23.015 --> 07:24.131
Job.

07:27.553 --> 07:29.387
Job.

08:34.203 --> 08:37.171
- Sorry I'm late.
- 45 minutes, Carrie.

08:37.206 --> 08:39.623
Her teacher couldn't wait.

08:42.094 --> 08:43.544
What did she say?

08:43.596 --> 08:46.380
Well, Deva's missing assignments,
she's disruptive in class,

08:46.432 --> 08:49.133
and basically her attitude sucks.

08:49.185 --> 08:51.051
And apparently the school
feels that our daughter

08:51.103 --> 08:54.104
is lacking any kind of
discipline or structure at home.

08:54.140 --> 08:56.056
- And that's my fault?
- I'm not pointing fingers.

08:56.108 --> 08:58.476
Well, you just did and this
from a mayor who bangs hookers.

08:58.478 --> 09:00.528
Yeah, and like abandoning your
family to go off to hunt down

09:00.563 --> 09:03.481
your gangster father is
a lesson in family values?

09:03.533 --> 09:05.816
Fuck you, Gordon.

09:06.819 --> 09:09.153
Carrie, can you stop, please?

09:10.706 --> 09:14.875
Look, we need to do better.

09:16.796 --> 09:20.331
I realize that I have
been blaming everybody else

09:20.383 --> 09:23.384
for my inability to handle
everything that's happened.

09:23.419 --> 09:27.505
I just... it's our family.

09:29.008 --> 09:32.009
But you know that I have
never been a victim in my life

09:32.011 --> 09:35.145
and I'm done with that.

09:35.181 --> 09:38.516
I want to figure this out for all of us.

09:46.909 --> 09:50.361
Where I come from, it's customary

09:50.363 --> 09:53.531
to drink to a job well done.

09:53.533 --> 09:55.332
Ha!

09:55.368 --> 09:56.951
Done?

09:58.421 --> 10:01.755
That algorithm was just the
tip of this cluster fuck.

10:01.791 --> 10:05.376
No, it's the small victories
that keep you in the fight.

10:05.428 --> 10:08.429
I know you the Dalai Lama
of Mayberry and all that ,

10:08.464 --> 10:11.515
but that don't mean everything
coming out your mouth is wisdom.

10:11.551 --> 10:14.184
It is far from party time.

10:14.220 --> 10:16.136
Fine.

10:16.188 --> 10:17.805
Cheers.

10:26.482 --> 10:28.315
Who'd you piss off this time?

10:34.624 --> 10:37.157
We may have to bail.

10:37.209 --> 10:39.209
What, on the job?

10:39.245 --> 10:41.412
On everything.

10:42.665 --> 10:44.465
Everything everything?

10:44.500 --> 10:46.550
How bad is it?

10:48.087 --> 10:50.971
- Siobhan has the police file on me.
- Oh, fuck.

10:51.007 --> 10:53.674
So why aren't we already
doing 95 out of this shithole?

10:53.726 --> 10:55.926
Could be she won't turn me in.

10:56.979 --> 10:59.597
Let me explain something to you.

10:59.599 --> 11:01.565
There are fake cops...
that's you...

11:01.601 --> 11:04.685
and there are real cops...
that's her.

11:04.737 --> 11:08.272
Difference being real
cops will turn your ass in.

11:08.274 --> 11:10.774
Maybe not.

11:10.826 --> 11:13.243
Would you please tell this man

11:16.415 --> 11:19.750
You two both do time
what you gotta do.' run

11:19.785 --> 11:21.502
But I'm going to work, Job.

11:24.373 --> 11:28.125
Baby, I want you to try real hard

11:28.127 --> 11:31.595
to remember what happened the last
time you rolled the dice on a woman.

11:32.715 --> 11:34.798
Fuck this. I'm packing.

11:54.487 --> 11:56.737
- When were you gonna tell me?
- Brock.

11:56.789 --> 11:59.289
You're working for Proctor
now, Emily? Have you lost it?

11:59.325 --> 12:01.075
How could you possibly know that?

12:01.127 --> 12:02.876
- I called your agency.
- You did what?

12:02.912 --> 12:04.328
- I didn't hear from you.
- Jesus Christ, Brock.

12:04.380 --> 12:06.080
- I was worried about you.
- You're spying on me.

12:06.132 --> 12:07.831
- I'm not spying on you.
- You're unbelievable.

12:07.883 --> 12:09.550
Do you have any idea
how dangerous Proctor is?

12:09.585 --> 12:11.051
The kind of people that he deals with?

12:11.087 --> 12:12.586
d now you're living
in the goddamn house?

12:12.638 --> 12:13.887
His mother is dying.

12:13.923 --> 12:15.589
Yeah, well, apparently
she's not the only one.

12:15.641 --> 12:19.309
I was there the other day fishing
a dead gangbanger out of his pool.

12:19.345 --> 12:22.312
Em, bad things happen there.

12:22.348 --> 12:24.682
I care for the dying.

12:24.684 --> 12:26.183
That's what I do.

12:26.235 --> 12:27.985
That's what I'm gonna keep on doing.

12:28.020 --> 12:31.271
Listen. Em, I'm begging you.

12:31.323 --> 12:33.357
Get as far away from
that man as possible.

12:33.409 --> 12:35.242
The only one I need
to get away from isou.

12:35.327 --> 12:36.694
Emily.

12:41.367 --> 12:44.118
That's very interesting.

12:44.170 --> 12:47.588
Just call me if anything changes.

12:49.041 --> 12:51.709
Tommy Littlestone's body
has been cleared for release.

12:53.462 --> 12:56.880
I'm pretty sure his brother's eager
to get him back to the reservation.

12:59.385 --> 13:01.552
I want to go, too.

13:04.724 --> 13:06.557
All right.

13:09.979 --> 13:12.062
Thank you, Ule.

13:20.406 --> 13:22.072
My mother is driving me crazy.

13:22.124 --> 13:23.874
She's got a problem
with everything I do.

13:23.909 --> 13:27.211
Any time you want to trade
moms, just say the word.

13:27.246 --> 13:28.746
Sorry.

13:28.798 --> 13:31.381
Yeah, didn't think so.

13:32.885 --> 13:34.501
How is Max doing?

13:35.638 --> 13:37.921
Fine, I guess.

13:40.509 --> 13:43.177
Max has been wanting
that game for months.

13:43.229 --> 13:46.013
$75 for a video game? What the hell?

13:46.065 --> 13:47.681
It's crazy.

13:58.277 --> 13:59.660
How's she doing?

13:59.695 --> 14:02.446
Resting comfortably.

14:02.498 --> 14:04.531
The new meds are doing a
better job with the pain.

14:04.583 --> 14:06.333
That's good.

14:06.368 --> 14:08.352
Thank you for taking
such good care of her.

14:08.387 --> 14:10.871
Well, it's what she deserves.

14:10.923 --> 14:12.623
It's what we all deserve.

14:12.625 --> 14:14.625
Yeah.

14:15.795 --> 14:17.594
How are you holding up, Mr. Proctor?

14:17.630 --> 14:19.630
Me?

14:21.133 --> 14:23.300
Well, I'm not the one who's dying.

14:23.302 --> 14:27.304
But you are suffering and
you don't get any meds.

14:30.226 --> 14:32.860
The downside to being
strong for everyone else

14:32.895 --> 14:35.529
is that you never get
a moment for yourself.

14:35.564 --> 14:37.981
If you ever want to talk or...

14:40.653 --> 14:42.986
I've got nowhere else to be.

14:46.742 --> 14:48.826
Do you want to sit down?

15:13.018 --> 15:14.985
Apple on three.

15:20.359 --> 15:21.942
Table six is ready to order.

15:21.994 --> 15:23.694
Table nine needs silverware.

15:23.746 --> 15:27.865
And the campers on 12 are asking
for a third refill on coffee.

15:51.223 --> 15:53.023
A little help here.

15:53.058 --> 15:55.309
12 is still asking for that refill.

15:55.361 --> 15:57.394
Carrie.

16:19.668 --> 16:22.669
- What now?
- We wait.

16:41.106 --> 16:43.240
Stay here.

17:23.398 --> 17:25.531
<i>Get in.</i>

17:28.319 --> 17:30.487
I've been practicing with my uncle.

17:30.489 --> 17:32.739
You're not an experienced driver.

17:32.791 --> 17:35.158
Well, then let's go
get me some experience.

18:36.448 --> 18:38.248
What the hell?

19:55.944 --> 19:58.111
You called. What's going on?

19:58.113 --> 20:01.447
I'm withdrawing Proctor's plea bargain.

20:01.499 --> 20:03.282
I don't understand.

20:03.284 --> 20:05.451
We'll file the motion
first thing in the morning.

20:05.453 --> 20:07.587
Sperling is gonna go apeshit on us.

20:08.923 --> 20:11.674
Well, that's just the gravy.

20:21.636 --> 20:23.803
By the way, I'm sorry I was a jerk.

20:23.855 --> 20:26.522
You weren't a jerk.

20:26.558 --> 20:29.308
You were an asshole.

22:11.963 --> 22:14.247
I should probably go.
Let you get settled.

22:14.249 --> 22:16.249
You've got secrets, boss.

22:16.251 --> 22:17.884
Don't we all?

22:19.754 --> 22:22.588
If they ever get to be too
much or if you want to talk...

22:26.928 --> 22:29.762
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

22:34.736 --> 22:35.935
<i>Hi, you've reached Siobhan Kelly.</i>

22:35.987 --> 22:38.905
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

22:45.280 --> 22:46.612
- Hood.
- Yeah?

22:46.664 --> 22:48.164
I just got a call from fire and rescue.

22:48.199 --> 22:49.699
There's a wreck out on Highway 6.

22:49.751 --> 22:52.418
- You handle it.
- Two DOAs, both Redbones.

22:53.788 --> 22:55.922
They were transporting
Tommy Littlestone's body.

22:58.293 --> 22:59.926
Great, let's go.

23:01.396 --> 23:03.446
<i>♪ Black or white ♪</i>

23:03.481 --> 23:08.151
<i>♪ She's always the same ♪</i>

23:08.987 --> 23:11.204
<i>♪ Lays in bed ♪</i>

23:11.239 --> 23:15.992
<i>♪ Naked and unashamed... ♪</i>

23:19.397 --> 23:22.365
Tequila. Whatever you got.

23:22.400 --> 23:26.152
She'll have the Anejo, chilled.

23:26.154 --> 23:29.822
A real woman like you, I think
that she deserves the best.

23:29.874 --> 23:31.490
You buying?

23:31.543 --> 23:32.992
Yes, ma'am.

23:34.662 --> 23:36.162
Make it a double.

23:43.054 --> 23:44.420
And keep 'em coming.

24:14.252 --> 24:16.285
I thought I was having a bad day.

24:16.337 --> 24:18.454
<i>What do we got?</i>

24:18.506 --> 24:20.873
Driver is Hakan Evans.

24:20.875 --> 24:23.426
He signed for the body at the morgue.

24:23.461 --> 24:26.045
We'll need dental records
to identify the other.

24:26.047 --> 24:28.547
- Any witnesses?
- Not out here.

24:28.600 --> 24:32.685
A second set of skid marks confirms
another vehicle was involved.

24:32.720 --> 24:35.438
- Could have been an accident.
- Yeah.

24:36.975 --> 24:38.891
You know this wasn't an accident.

24:38.977 --> 24:40.393
No?

24:40.395 --> 24:42.695
Chayton is gonna see this
as a declaration of war.

24:42.730 --> 24:44.780
Yeah, well, that's Proctor's problem.

24:44.816 --> 24:46.399
Well, what are we gonna do about it?

24:46.401 --> 24:48.284
- Nothing.
- What?

24:49.370 --> 24:51.237
We stay the fuck out of it.

25:01.666 --> 25:03.249
Ah, it burns so good.

25:03.251 --> 25:05.418
You have a real pretty smile.

25:05.470 --> 25:07.970
- Yeah, I still got it.
- Yes, ma'am.

25:08.006 --> 25:09.422
That's good.

25:09.474 --> 25:13.009
Is that your bike parked outside?

25:13.061 --> 25:15.728
- Sexy beast, isn't she?
- Mmm.

25:17.098 --> 25:19.398
I used to dream about
owning a machine like that.

25:19.434 --> 25:21.434
What do you mean used to?

25:21.436 --> 25:23.486
Another life.

25:23.521 --> 25:26.989
Well, that is a terribly sad story.

25:29.077 --> 25:33.029
But don't you worry 'cause
your new buddy Scuyver,

25:33.081 --> 25:35.498
well, he's all about the happy endings.

25:36.534 --> 25:38.617
Is that right?

25:38.670 --> 25:40.453
That is right.

25:41.456 --> 25:43.622
I think that...

25:43.624 --> 25:47.259
maybe you and me should
go somewhere more private.

25:47.295 --> 25:50.463
That sounds great, but, no.

25:50.465 --> 25:53.049
I gotta go.

25:53.101 --> 25:55.301
- Maybe next time.
- What?

25:56.220 --> 25:58.804
Hey, hey, hey. Hey. Hey.

25:58.856 --> 26:01.941
I got six drinks

26:01.976 --> 26:05.027
invested in this little party.

26:05.063 --> 26:08.147
So you ain't going nowhere

26:08.149 --> 26:10.816
till you show me

26:10.818 --> 26:13.035
a little gratitude.

26:39.680 --> 26:42.348
When I say no, I mean it.

27:17.718 --> 27:19.051
<i>Hi, you've reached Siobhan Kelly.</i>

27:19.053 --> 27:21.554
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

27:34.235 --> 27:35.618
Where are you?

27:35.653 --> 27:37.787
You should be asking where I'm not.

27:37.822 --> 27:39.955
Because in 20 minutes,
the answer's gonna be

27:39.991 --> 27:41.874
Banshee,
Pennsyl-fucking-vania.

27:41.909 --> 27:44.126
Give me until the end of the
day and I'll come with you.

27:44.162 --> 27:46.745
<i>Just gotta tie up a few loose ends.</i>

27:46.798 --> 27:48.747
Well, then you tie them up quick, baby,

27:48.749 --> 27:51.634
and let's get the fuck out of here.

28:03.764 --> 28:05.097
Hey.

28:06.601 --> 28:08.434
- Hey, Deva.
- What?

28:09.937 --> 28:12.271
- You aren't in school.
- I'm just running a little late.

28:12.323 --> 28:13.906
Well, maybe that's 'cause
you're going the wrong way.

28:13.941 --> 28:16.609
- Like you never ditched.
- I never got caught.

28:16.611 --> 28:19.445
Hey, Deva, I'm
sorry about the other day.

28:19.447 --> 28:20.946
I'm over it, seriously.

28:20.948 --> 28:24.450
Look, I didn't mean to blow you off.

28:24.452 --> 28:26.619
Okay? I...
You caught me off guard

28:26.671 --> 28:29.038
and everything came
out wrong and I'm sorry.

28:29.090 --> 28:30.956
Well, it won't happen again, okay?

28:31.008 --> 28:33.225
From now on, you're just the
asshole who knocked up my mom.

28:33.261 --> 28:36.679
Okay, fine, I'm the asshole.

28:36.714 --> 28:39.298
I mean, I've caused you nothing
but problems since I got here,

28:39.350 --> 28:40.466
so I get it.

28:40.468 --> 28:42.351
Pretty much.

28:42.386 --> 28:44.103
Fuck.

28:44.138 --> 28:45.855
- Why do you even care?
- I just do.

28:45.890 --> 28:48.140
Why?

28:49.694 --> 28:53.145
Look, my old man never
gave a shit about me.

28:53.197 --> 28:55.147
All right? I mean...

28:55.149 --> 28:57.366
I guess you could call him honest.

28:58.452 --> 29:01.237
But I fucking hated him for it.

29:01.289 --> 29:03.822
I still do. I wish I didn't, but I do.

29:06.160 --> 29:08.661
<i>I don't want you to hate me, Deva.</i>

29:10.131 --> 29:13.082
But I can't make you
do anything; no one can.

29:14.669 --> 29:17.169
That's a choice you
gotta make on your own.

29:19.557 --> 29:21.140
You're leaving, aren't you?

29:24.679 --> 29:26.645
I have to.

29:29.684 --> 29:31.850
Does it matter that I want you to stay?

29:35.406 --> 29:38.023
Yes.

29:38.075 --> 29:42.611
It matters.
Okay?

29:46.450 --> 29:49.368
But I made a huge fucking mess, kid.

29:51.289 --> 29:55.174
- And I have to go.
- Yeah.

29:58.212 --> 30:00.179
I don't hate you.

30:02.967 --> 30:04.516
Well, maybe a little bit.

30:07.521 --> 30:09.722
I can live with that.

30:19.867 --> 30:22.451
What the fuck are you doing?

30:22.486 --> 30:24.370
Hi, Jackson. We have an appointment?

30:24.405 --> 30:26.405
We had a goddamn deal.

30:26.407 --> 30:27.990
Yeah, well, our position has changed.

30:28.042 --> 30:29.708
You can't do this.

30:29.744 --> 30:31.160
It's already done.

30:31.212 --> 30:32.911
Proctor will have his day in court.

30:32.913 --> 30:34.580
You're making a big mistake, Gordon.

30:34.582 --> 30:36.915
Careful, Jackson, that
almost sounded like a threat.

30:36.968 --> 30:38.917
It's a warning.

30:38.919 --> 30:40.803
I'm gonna come at you
with everything I've got.

30:40.838 --> 30:43.555
Yeah, and what you've
got is a guilty client.

30:47.261 --> 30:49.395
You should talk some
sense into your boss.

30:49.430 --> 30:51.013
Your ass is on the line here, too.

30:51.065 --> 30:53.098
I appreciate your concern.

31:13.167 --> 31:16.452

Shit.

33:15.493 --> 33:17.409
So you want to talk about it?

33:17.411 --> 33:20.462
It was stupid. I just
got carried away is all.

33:31.725 --> 33:33.976
I feel trapped.

33:34.011 --> 33:35.644
I keep waking up from a dream

33:35.679 --> 33:38.430
to realize that it's real life
that's become the nightmare.

33:38.482 --> 33:41.817
Then I do these stupid,
dangerous things.

33:41.852 --> 33:43.318
I know that.

33:43.354 --> 33:47.272
It's just... I need to breathe.

33:49.243 --> 33:51.443
Well, I know how that feels.

33:58.919 --> 34:00.919
It's good to have you around.

34:05.709 --> 34:08.460
Yeah.

34:09.797 --> 34:12.264
- About that.
- What?

34:14.435 --> 34:15.851
What?

35:01.348 --> 35:04.516
I know I'm being selfish,
but I don't want you to go.

35:06.353 --> 35:08.186
Not now.

35:08.239 --> 35:11.189
Well, there's really no
choice anymore, is there?

35:14.361 --> 35:15.744
Do you really think she'd arrest you?

35:15.779 --> 35:17.696
It doesn't really matter, does it?

35:19.199 --> 35:21.366
She knows.

35:50.147 --> 35:52.481
Where are you gonna go?

35:52.533 --> 35:53.732
I don't know.

35:55.986 --> 35:57.286
Anywhere.

35:57.321 --> 36:00.238
Right.

36:08.082 --> 36:10.332
Deva.

36:13.420 --> 36:15.554
She'll be okay.

36:17.925 --> 36:20.092
She's strong.

36:20.928 --> 36:22.728
Like her mom.

36:28.435 --> 36:31.436
And what about you?

36:31.488 --> 36:33.071
Are you gonna be okay?

36:37.161 --> 36:38.910
Of course.

37:48.682 --> 37:50.565
<i>Yeah?</i>

37:52.686 --> 37:55.520
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:55.572 --> 37:57.656
You look upset. Everything okay?

38:01.995 --> 38:03.495
It'll be all right.

38:05.332 --> 38:07.416
You know we have to talk about school.

38:07.451 --> 38:10.202
Yeah.

38:10.204 --> 38:12.838
Not tonight, though.

38:12.873 --> 38:14.706
Get some sleep.

38:14.758 --> 38:17.008
Okay. Good night.

38:17.044 --> 38:19.010
Good night.

38:22.216 --> 38:24.216
You can get undressed now.

38:41.785 --> 38:43.735
Are you leaving?

38:44.788 --> 38:46.288
You wanna take on the Redbones,

38:46.323 --> 38:48.573
go right ahead.

38:48.575 --> 38:49.958
I'm too old and too tired

38:49.993 --> 38:51.960
to be sticking my nose
where it don't belong.

38:51.995 --> 38:53.962
We're the goddamn police, Karl.

38:56.800 --> 38:58.583
I'm going home.

38:58.635 --> 39:00.886
Don't call me unless
the building's on fire.

40:28.425 --> 40:30.675
<i>I still don't
think you're much of a cop,</i>

40:30.677 --> 40:32.844
<i>but I think you're serious
about getting Proctor.</i>

40:32.846 --> 40:36.147
<i>And this town's been waiting for
somebody to do that for a long, long time.</i>

40:36.183 --> 40:40.518
<i>Sheriff, do you
know why they're afraid of me?</i>

40:40.520 --> 40:42.354
<i>Why is that?</i>

40:42.356 --> 40:44.439
<i>Because they should be.</i>

40:44.491 --> 40:46.491
<i>And maybe you should be, too.</i>

40:46.526 --> 40:49.611
<i>You have no evidence, no body,</i>

40:49.663 --> 40:51.363
<i>not even a name you say.</i>

40:51.365 --> 40:52.781
<i>Would you put him away?</i>

40:52.833 --> 40:55.533
<i>Could you even put him away?</i>

40:57.120 --> 41:00.505
A guilty verdict could
mean five years in prison.

41:00.540 --> 41:01.957
Not acceptable.

41:02.009 --> 41:05.377
I... I will file every motion
I can to slow the process down,

41:05.379 --> 41:08.713
but barring a miracle, your case
is gonna be decided by a jury.

41:08.765 --> 41:11.716
<i>Then a miracle is
exactly what you're gonna get me.</i>

41:11.768 --> 41:13.768
You get it?

41:17.774 --> 41:20.308
- Yeah?
- Kai, it's Emily.

41:21.311 --> 41:22.861
Your mother's taken a turn.

41:23.780 --> 41:26.231
<i>You should come home now.</i>

41:26.233 --> 41:27.732
She doesn't have much time.

41:27.784 --> 41:29.284
<i>Thank you, Emily.</i>

41:29.319 --> 41:31.403
I'm on my way.

41:32.956 --> 41:35.206
You fucking fix this.

41:38.245 --> 41:39.878
We're closed.

41:39.913 --> 41:42.047
Leave.

41:43.467 --> 41:45.717
- Get out.
- What the hell are you doing?

41:45.752 --> 41:47.385
You need to leave now.

41:47.421 --> 41:49.254
Whatever it is, Sheriff, it has to wait.

41:49.306 --> 41:50.472
No!

42:02.269 --> 42:03.652
Jesus.

42:07.991 --> 42:09.407
Call the police.

42:09.443 --> 42:11.276
<i>Uh, he is the police.</i>

42:12.612 --> 42:14.579
God damn it.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.084
Hood!

45:11.291 --> 45:14.008
Come on. Get up.

45:14.044 --> 45:15.710
Get up.

45:17.214 --> 45:19.631
You okay?

45:19.683 --> 45:22.050
Kai Proctor, you're under
arrest for assaulting an officer.

45:22.102 --> 45:25.053
Whoa, whoa. It was self-defense.
Hood attacked him first.

45:25.105 --> 45:27.472
Back up or I'll cuff your ass, too.

45:28.558 --> 45:30.024
Go to your grandmother. She needs you.

45:30.060 --> 45:31.309
Yeah, let's go.

45:50.497 --> 45:52.330
<i>Sorry for the wait.</i>

45:52.332 --> 45:53.665
You can all head back now.

45:53.667 --> 45:55.750
The sheriff will need
just a few minutes.

45:55.802 --> 45:58.336
Go.

46:08.682 --> 46:10.064
May I help you?

46:10.100 --> 46:12.350
I would like to speak
to the sheriff, please.

46:14.020 --> 46:15.486
Is he expecting you?

46:15.522 --> 46:18.022
- No, ma'am.
- Take a seat.

46:21.194 --> 46:24.612
On second thought, go wait back there.

46:24.664 --> 46:27.031
Yes, ma'am.

46:27.033 --> 46:29.367
This is beyond harassment.
I've got a dozen witnesses

46:29.419 --> 46:31.002
who will testify that
you started the fight.

46:31.037 --> 46:33.371
- Why don't you shut the fuck up?
- What the hell happened?

46:33.423 --> 46:35.290
- He tried to murder my client.
- I wasn't asking you.

46:35.342 --> 46:37.041
Do you have any idea how bad this looks?

46:37.043 --> 46:38.376
Ask me if I care.

46:38.378 --> 46:40.628
- Hood.
- Stay!

47:19.970 --> 47:22.086
What's up, farm boy?

47:29.596 --> 47:31.763
You three play nice.

47:50.450 --> 47:52.200
Hey, Hood.

47:52.252 --> 47:55.453
Yeah, don't worry. I got this.

48:40.800 --> 48:43.217
I'm not gonna turn you in.

48:44.554 --> 48:47.755
<i>Not because I don't want to,</i>

48:47.807 --> 48:51.509
but because the truth would
annihilate this department.

48:51.561 --> 48:55.480
It would wipe away all the good
work real cops have done around here.

49:02.021 --> 49:04.188
You know I tried to do
good with that badge.

49:05.525 --> 49:08.192
That badge was never yours to wear.

49:17.170 --> 49:19.370
Rabbit was your boss?

49:20.707 --> 49:22.540
You stole for him?

49:26.596 --> 49:28.045
Yes.

49:31.217 --> 49:33.718
And Carrie Hopewell,
the two of you were...

49:33.720 --> 49:37.054
- Yes.
- Jesus.

49:41.394 --> 49:46.731
- Why me?
- Siobhan, no matter what you think,

49:46.733 --> 49:50.234
you and me was not a lie.

49:53.072 --> 49:55.072
Siobhan, I swear to God.

50:03.583 --> 50:07.979
The only time I ever felt safe
was with you.

50:08.014 --> 50:09.921
I trusted you. I let you in.

50:09.973 --> 50:11.673
- I know.
- You endangered my life,

50:11.674 --> 50:12.807
my career, and I let you.

50:12.842 --> 50:15.059
- Siobhan.
- No.

50:16.729 --> 50:19.096
Don't fuckin' touch me.

50:24.020 --> 50:26.737
This is what you're gonna do.

50:26.773 --> 50:29.006
You're gonna go out there right now,

50:29.108 --> 50:32.493
you're gonna finish booking Proctor,

50:32.745 --> 50:35.769
and then you're gonna quietly resign.

50:41.171 --> 50:43.287
Then what?

50:44.757 --> 50:47.091
And then you're gonna walk away.

50:57.854 --> 50:58.970
Get down!
