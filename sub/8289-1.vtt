01:51.586 --> 01:52.816
Deanie, please.

01:54.691 --> 01:56.124
Bud, I'm afraid.

01:58.762 --> 02:00.127
Oh, Bud.

02:05.268 --> 02:06.496
Don't, Bud.

02:07.270 --> 02:08.294
No.

02:08.771 --> 02:10.330
We mustn't, Bud.

02:11.008 --> 02:13.067
No. No.

02:25.024 --> 02:26.651
Bud, don't be mad.

02:31.296 --> 02:33.059
I'd better take you home.

02:57.692 --> 03:00.126
We've had enough kissing for tonight.

04:05.265 --> 04:06.562
Has Bud left?

04:07.000 --> 04:08.126
Yes, Mom.

04:14.574 --> 04:16.974
There's wonderful news tonight.

04:17.277 --> 04:21.839
The Stamper Oil stocks, drink your milk,
went up 14 points today.

04:22.785 --> 04:24.218
Think of it, honey.

04:24.319 --> 04:29.188
That means if we sold those stocks,
we'd make $15,000.

04:29.691 --> 04:33.183
Maybe we can even send you away
to college next year.

04:33.762 --> 04:35.787
Well, we're not going to sell.

04:36.265 --> 04:39.496
Your father says that everyone
at the Elks says...

04:39.601 --> 04:43.059
...that the stocks are going up even higher.

04:46.208 --> 04:49.008
Didn't Bud say anything about it tonight?

04:49.213 --> 04:52.979
He doesn't know anything
about his father's business, Mom.

04:54.552 --> 04:56.645
He doesn't care about that.

04:57.354 --> 05:01.290
What were you and Bud doing all this time,
for heaven's sake?

05:01.759 --> 05:03.784
We were studying together.

05:13.306 --> 05:16.002
I'm going to bed, Mom. I'm awfully tired.

05:21.247 --> 05:22.737
Now, Wilma Dean...

05:28.554 --> 05:30.249
I want to talk to you.

05:30.957 --> 05:34.893
Now, Wilma Dean, Bud Stamper could
get you into a whole lot of trouble.

05:35.061 --> 05:37.052
And you know how I mean.

05:37.999 --> 05:41.594
Boys don't respect a girl
they can go all the way with.

05:42.403 --> 05:44.837
Boys want a nice girl for a wife.

05:49.010 --> 05:52.969
Wilma Dean, you and Bud haven't gone
too far already, have you?

05:53.248 --> 05:54.510
No, Mother.

05:55.083 --> 05:56.983
Tell me the truth, Wilma Dean!

05:58.720 --> 06:01.154
No, Mom, we haven't gone too far.

06:06.062 --> 06:07.552
That's a relief.

06:10.000 --> 06:10.898
Mom?

06:12.202 --> 06:15.694
Is it so terrible to have those feelings
about a boy?

06:16.840 --> 06:18.467
No nice girl does.

06:19.509 --> 06:20.635
Doesn't she?

06:20.777 --> 06:22.972
No. No nice girl.

06:27.619 --> 06:28.916
But, Mom...

06:30.756 --> 06:32.519
...didn't you ever...

06:37.696 --> 06:40.096
Didn't you ever feel that way about Dad?

06:41.366 --> 06:45.393
Your father never laid a hand on me
until we were married.

06:46.338 --> 06:47.669
And then...

06:48.073 --> 06:51.201
...I just gave in because a wife has to.

06:53.213 --> 06:56.774
A woman doesn't enjoy those things
the way a man does.

06:58.385 --> 07:00.444
She just lets her husband...

07:03.223 --> 07:07.057
...come near her in order to have children.

07:16.770 --> 07:19.366
Deanie, what's troubling you?

07:20.009 --> 07:21.442
Oh, nothing, Mom.

07:23.546 --> 07:24.877
I'm just tired.

07:26.782 --> 07:28.272
I want to go to bed now.

07:29.251 --> 07:30.775
Now, Deanie...

07:33.789 --> 07:36.917
...you tell Bud Stamper to bring you home
earlier after this...

07:37.026 --> 07:39.358
...especially on school nights.

07:41.030 --> 07:43.933
"Good night, sleep tight,
don't let the bedbugs bite. "

07:44.035 --> 07:45.059
'Night.

08:18.838 --> 08:21.864
"Our Father which art in heaven,
Hallowed be thy name... "

08:34.389 --> 08:35.447
Something wrong?

08:35.557 --> 08:38.491
Wilma Dean and the Stamper boy
are in love.

08:38.794 --> 08:41.058
They're in love, I tell you, Del!

08:41.163 --> 08:43.063
Go back to sleep, Mama.

08:43.597 --> 08:46.692
He'd be the catch of a lifetime, Del.

09:05.189 --> 09:07.623
I hope we bring in a gusher
every day, Boss!

09:11.128 --> 09:13.096
Hold it! Hold it!

09:13.597 --> 09:15.258
Boss, Bud's here. Here's Bud!

09:15.365 --> 09:17.390
Come on in here, my boy.

09:17.534 --> 09:20.367
Your old man will get us in trouble
with our wives...

09:20.471 --> 09:24.068
...'cause we'll go home smelling
like home brew and they'll wonder why.

09:24.176 --> 09:25.165
They'll want some, too.

09:25.277 --> 09:28.041
- Get something to eat, Son.
- I gotta go up to bed now.

09:28.147 --> 09:30.411
Wait a minute, Son. I want to talk to you.

09:30.516 --> 09:34.008
You go on entertaining yourselves.
I'll have a few words with my boy here.

09:34.120 --> 09:37.089
Have more of this venison.
You don't get meat like that anymore.

09:37.189 --> 09:39.680
They don't make home brew
like that anymore.

09:41.460 --> 09:44.486
It's pretty late for a boy
keeping football training, isn't it?

09:44.597 --> 09:46.929
Come here. I want to talk to you, Son.

09:47.635 --> 09:52.038
You're the captain of the team, Son.
Those other boys look up to you.

09:52.440 --> 09:54.601
You gotta run with the ball.

09:56.644 --> 10:01.081
I wasn't much older than you, Bud,
when I fell off that crown block...

10:01.482 --> 10:03.473
...and I hit that rig floor.

10:05.286 --> 10:07.777
And my running days was long gone.

10:12.462 --> 10:15.829
So, you're doing the running
for both of us now, boy.

10:16.466 --> 10:18.400
Listen, I brought in a well today.

10:18.501 --> 10:22.164
She's flowing over 100 barrels an hour,
and our stocks are going way up.

10:22.272 --> 10:25.366
Those big Eastern companies are beginning
to take notice of us.

10:25.475 --> 10:28.035
Them people really beginning
to take notice of us.

10:28.144 --> 10:30.476
- That's great.
- You been out with the Loomis girl?

10:30.580 --> 10:33.378
- Yes, sir.
- Are you watching yourself with her?

10:35.018 --> 10:37.750
You're not doing anything
you'll be ashamed of, are you?

10:37.856 --> 10:38.880
No, sir.

10:38.990 --> 10:42.323
She's a nice kid, Son. She's a good looker.

10:42.427 --> 10:46.488
I've known her folks ever since
old Del and I were boys together.

10:46.598 --> 10:49.089
I got nothing against them
'cause they're poor.

10:49.201 --> 10:51.101
I'm not a snob or anything like that.

10:51.203 --> 10:54.536
The only difference between me and Del
is that I got ambition.

10:54.639 --> 10:55.970
Hey, Dad, I-

10:56.074 --> 10:59.566
But if anything was to happen,
you'd have to marry her.

11:00.178 --> 11:04.014
You'd have to marry her, Son.
You realize that, don't you?

11:04.184 --> 11:07.278
You get a girl in trouble
and you gotta take the consequences.

11:07.387 --> 11:08.786
- Dad, I'm not-
- Sit down.

11:08.889 --> 11:10.789
- I want to talk to you-
- Sit down.

11:10.891 --> 11:13.121
- I want to talk to you about that.
- All right.

11:13.227 --> 11:15.422
All right, lay it on me. Come on.

11:15.529 --> 11:18.828
Lay it on me. That a boy.
There we go, lay it on me.

11:19.566 --> 11:22.729
Lay it on now. Lick like a bear.

11:22.836 --> 11:25.600
We got a future, boy.
You and me, we got a future.

11:25.806 --> 11:28.038
First, we'll get you an education.

11:28.143 --> 11:29.906
The best. Four years at Yale.

11:30.012 --> 11:31.377
Did I tell you a secret?

11:31.480 --> 11:33.038
- I'll tell you a secret.
- What?

11:33.148 --> 11:34.172
Come here.

11:34.283 --> 11:38.219
My company is gonna merge
with one of those big Eastern companies.

11:38.320 --> 11:41.221
I'm gonna put you in there, boy.

11:41.323 --> 11:43.791
I'm lining up a future for you, boy.

11:43.892 --> 11:45.257
I've been thinking about-

11:45.361 --> 11:49.092
There ain't nothing in this world
that I wouldn't do for you, boy.

11:49.198 --> 11:49.926
I know.

11:50.032 --> 11:52.525
There's nothing I wouldn't do
if you do right.

11:52.637 --> 11:54.264
If you do right, Bud!

11:55.172 --> 11:57.333
Now, don't disappoint me, Son.

11:58.175 --> 11:59.938
Don't disappoint me, boy.

12:01.078 --> 12:03.842
God knows I've had
one disappointment already.

12:05.549 --> 12:08.109
- She asleep?
- Yes, finally.

12:08.919 --> 12:10.784
- Is Sis back?
- Hello, Bud, darling.

12:10.888 --> 12:13.584
Mother brought her home
from Chicago a little while ago.

12:13.691 --> 12:14.749
Welcome home, Mom.

12:14.859 --> 12:17.989
It was a miserable trip, just miserable.
How's Deanie?

12:19.499 --> 12:20.659
I don't know.

12:21.067 --> 12:22.466
I'm gonna go to bed, Dad.

12:22.568 --> 12:25.503
I'm going to bed, too,
but I'm afraid I won't sleep a wink.

12:25.605 --> 12:27.334
Yeah, you go to bed, Son.

12:27.573 --> 12:30.007
You got a football game to win tomorrow.

12:33.146 --> 12:35.410
I got all my hopes pinned on you now.

12:43.591 --> 12:45.525
How're you men getting on in there?

12:52.667 --> 12:54.931
Well, you certainly spoiled that girl.

12:55.437 --> 12:58.736
First you send her off to finishing school.

12:59.140 --> 13:01.438
She breaks all the rules
and they kick her out.

13:01.543 --> 13:03.408
Then you send her off to university.

13:03.511 --> 13:05.706
She goes hog wild
and flunks all her courses.

13:05.814 --> 13:09.149
Then you had to learn your lesson
all over again, didn't you?

13:09.252 --> 13:12.244
Let her go off to art school
in a wild place like Chicago.

13:12.356 --> 13:16.486
She gets tied up with some cake-eater who
gets her into trouble so he can marry her.

13:17.127 --> 13:18.924
Your lawyer got it annulled.

13:19.062 --> 13:20.859
Damn right I got it annulled.

13:20.964 --> 13:24.832
When I made it clear to "Mr. Cake-Eater"
that I'd cut off her allowance...

13:24.935 --> 13:27.096
...he backed out in a hurry.

13:27.237 --> 13:29.831
She's just a headstrong little flapper...

13:29.940 --> 13:33.002
...but I'll keep her home
and teach her a little discipline.

13:34.780 --> 13:36.008
Yes, sir.

13:36.548 --> 13:40.006
I'm gonna keep that young lady home,
teach her a little discipline.

13:40.119 --> 13:42.713
If you think I'll stay
in this God-forsaken town...

13:42.821 --> 13:46.257
...and have people gossip about me,
you've got another think coming.

13:46.358 --> 13:48.690
I'll really give them something
to gossip about.

13:48.794 --> 13:51.592
Why, Sister, you're up so early!

13:51.697 --> 13:53.665
I can't sleep in this house.

13:54.199 --> 13:57.864
I'm going to California and live
with Aunt Blossom and study art.

13:58.539 --> 13:59.471
Art who?

14:01.075 --> 14:02.940
Welcome home, Miss Virginia.

14:03.210 --> 14:04.234
Phoebe.

14:06.347 --> 14:08.542
I hate it here. I'm a freak in this town.

14:08.649 --> 14:11.550
Everybody stares at me
like I'm something out of a carnival.

14:11.652 --> 14:14.746
'Cause you peroxide your hair
and paint your face like an Indian.

14:14.855 --> 14:16.254
Good morning, everybody.

14:16.357 --> 14:18.188
- Hey, how are you?
- Just great.

14:18.292 --> 14:21.056
He's gonna make me stay home
a whole year just to punish me.

14:21.162 --> 14:24.099
There aren't any more schools left
that'll have you.

14:24.367 --> 14:26.267
There's nothing so distasteful-

14:26.369 --> 14:28.564
This is the ugliest place
in the whole world.

14:28.671 --> 14:31.367
Everywhere you look is an oil well,
even on the front lawn.

14:31.474 --> 14:33.738
I'll bet you'd drill right here
in the dining room.

14:33.843 --> 14:36.676
Damn right I would, if I thought
there was any oil in there.

14:36.779 --> 14:38.770
I'll see you later.

14:39.215 --> 14:41.581
How do you want your eggs, Bud darling?

14:42.452 --> 14:44.579
Come back here
and eat a decent breakfast!

14:45.121 --> 14:45.849
I'm late.

14:46.122 --> 14:49.753
Come back! You can't play a football game
on a breakfast like that!

14:55.867 --> 14:58.768
Neither of my children gets
any real nourishment.

15:10.882 --> 15:12.179
Hey, you want a peach?

15:12.283 --> 15:13.274
What?

15:13.553 --> 15:14.986
Don't! Bud, don't!

15:55.797 --> 15:57.196
Pardonnez-moi.

16:30.570 --> 16:32.970
Wilma Dean, hereafter,
I shall count you tardy...

16:33.072 --> 16:35.472
...if you are not in your seat
when the bell rings.

16:35.575 --> 16:37.372
I'm sorry, Miss Metcalf.

16:44.016 --> 16:45.381
Alan, please.

16:48.487 --> 16:49.545
All right.

16:52.961 --> 16:55.452
For the first few weeks,
we've been reading...

16:55.563 --> 16:59.499
...the stories of King Arthur
and the Knights of the Round Table.

16:59.934 --> 17:02.926
The literature of the age
was characterized by...

17:05.339 --> 17:06.500
All right, Alan?

17:10.678 --> 17:12.009
"By high ideals. "

17:13.381 --> 17:15.645
True. And by what else?

17:16.984 --> 17:19.012
You going with us to the football game?

17:19.455 --> 17:20.980
All right, Carolyn?

17:21.156 --> 17:22.954
They were very religious.

17:23.226 --> 17:27.685
Religion was an important part of the lives
of the Knights and their fair ladies.

17:28.365 --> 17:29.593
What else?

17:30.233 --> 17:33.031
I'm going with you, but I'm waiting
for Bud after the game.

17:33.136 --> 17:34.603
We knew that, crazy.

17:42.781 --> 17:44.908
The Knights of the Round Table...

17:45.484 --> 17:48.453
- Just because his father's got money-
- That's not true.

17:49.254 --> 17:52.985
Well, they were very brave
and things like that.

17:53.458 --> 17:55.585
Bud Stamper isn't stuck on himself at all.

17:57.129 --> 18:00.621
What in the world do you mean
by "things like that" exactly?

18:03.535 --> 18:05.298
Well, I don't know exactly.

18:10.010 --> 18:14.037
Let us learn to express ourselves
with as much precision as possible.

18:17.151 --> 18:18.914
Juanita, you had your hand up?

18:19.353 --> 18:22.652
The Knights of the Round Table
had a very high regard for women.

18:23.023 --> 18:24.490
In what way, Juanita?

18:27.961 --> 18:31.021
They looked on women as very pure.

18:31.632 --> 18:33.966
They wouldn't look on her as very pure.

18:35.604 --> 18:38.300
All right now, I want it quiet
in this classroom!

18:38.808 --> 18:42.209
The next time there is talking
while this class is in session...

18:42.311 --> 18:45.838
...I am going to send the culprit
to the principal's office.

18:47.183 --> 18:49.242
Yes, Juanita, you're quite right.

18:49.985 --> 18:53.318
The Knights did have a very high regard
for womanhood.

18:54.390 --> 18:57.086
In fact, they put women on a pedestal.

18:58.496 --> 19:01.795
Some people say that chivalry is not dead.

19:03.134 --> 19:04.829
Well, how about it, girls?

19:05.069 --> 19:07.833
Do any of you feel
that you're on a pedestal?

19:20.218 --> 19:21.742
That's unnecessary roughness.

19:21.886 --> 19:22.912
Fifteen yards.

19:23.022 --> 19:25.149
Come on, you've been on me all day!

19:25.992 --> 19:28.256
You're out! You're out of the game!

19:34.567 --> 19:35.932
Who you taking out, Toots?

19:36.035 --> 19:37.468
Never mind who.

19:41.307 --> 19:43.969
Okay, okay, what's so funny about that?

19:44.544 --> 19:46.842
She's the only girl who knows
what it's all about.

19:46.946 --> 19:48.245
You can say that again.

19:48.350 --> 19:50.580
I'll never look twice at those other girls.

19:50.685 --> 19:54.246
They expect you to be satisfied
if they even kiss you good night.

20:06.234 --> 20:07.201
Hi, Bud.

20:07.335 --> 20:08.199
Hi, Juanita.

20:08.303 --> 20:10.294
Did you see Toots in there?

20:10.405 --> 20:12.534
Yeah, yeah. He should be right out.

20:12.643 --> 20:14.508
You played a wonderful game.

20:17.247 --> 20:18.305
Thank you.

20:25.756 --> 20:27.417
He should be right out.

20:33.397 --> 20:34.864
Hi, sweetheart.

20:36.166 --> 20:39.160
I suppose you wish I were more
like Juanita Howard, don't you?

20:39.271 --> 20:40.203
What?

20:41.807 --> 20:45.971
I saw the way you were looking at her.
I think she's disgraceful.

20:46.312 --> 20:48.940
The way she stands
waiting for one of the players-

20:49.048 --> 20:50.276
Wait a minute.

20:50.716 --> 20:54.345
There isn't any reason in the world
why I shouldn't speak to her.

20:54.453 --> 20:56.250
You were more than speaking to her.

20:56.355 --> 20:59.882
I'm supposed to not notice her?
Is that what you expect out of me?

20:59.992 --> 21:03.361
I'm not even supposed to know
girls like that exist, huh?

21:03.898 --> 21:05.365
Bud, I'm sorry.

21:06.667 --> 21:09.465
- I'm sorry, Bud, honest.
- All right, you're sorry.

21:15.443 --> 21:17.809
Mr. Loomis, a customer for meat.

21:21.716 --> 21:23.377
Bud, please don't be mad.

21:23.885 --> 21:25.182
I'm not mad, Deanie.

21:25.286 --> 21:26.844
Hi, Bud. Deanie.

21:26.954 --> 21:28.651
- Hi, Mr. Loomis.
- Hi, Dad.

21:34.163 --> 21:36.654
I just can't stand it
when you're mad at me.

21:37.901 --> 21:40.369
I don't know what's the matter
with me lately.

21:40.470 --> 21:42.597
I'm always losing my temper.

21:45.575 --> 21:48.476
You're the only girl in the world for me,
you know that?

21:48.578 --> 21:49.943
I want to be.

21:50.580 --> 21:52.550
If it weren't for you...

21:54.252 --> 21:56.516
If it weren't for you, Deanie, I'd...

21:58.189 --> 21:59.486
I don't know!

22:19.046 --> 22:20.570
Bud, it's broad daylight.

22:20.681 --> 22:22.808
- Who cares?
- Stop it. Stop it.

22:25.919 --> 22:28.410
Come on now. Bud! People can see us.

22:28.522 --> 22:29.716
I don't care.

22:29.890 --> 22:32.085
Bud, stop it. Come on now.

22:35.595 --> 22:36.493
Mom?

22:42.369 --> 22:43.269
Mom?

22:45.307 --> 22:46.569
She's not here.

22:46.809 --> 22:48.242
- Mom?
- "Mom?"

22:48.844 --> 22:50.175
Nobody's here.

22:50.913 --> 22:51.937
Stop that.

23:03.325 --> 23:05.316
Yes, Mrs. Harper, here's your change.

23:05.427 --> 23:08.557
Stop it. I have to pull down
the shade to the store.

23:15.606 --> 23:16.971
Bud, stop it.

23:22.013 --> 23:24.447
You're nuts about me, aren't you?

23:27.351 --> 23:29.114
You're nuts about me.

23:33.960 --> 23:38.363
I've got your ten-pound sack
in the back of the store, Mrs. Thatcher.

23:56.482 --> 23:57.883
At my feet, slave!

23:58.086 --> 24:00.020
- Bud, don't.
- Tell me you love me.

24:00.121 --> 24:02.555
- You're hurting me.
- Say you can't live without me.

24:02.657 --> 24:03.624
- Say it!
- I do.

24:03.725 --> 24:05.022
- Do what?
- I do love you.

24:05.126 --> 24:08.823
And you can't live without me.
You'd be everything I ever ask you to be.

24:08.930 --> 24:10.761
I'd do anything for you.

24:17.105 --> 24:19.335
Deanie, I didn't mean to hurt you.

24:28.752 --> 24:30.515
Deanie, I was just kidding.

24:31.321 --> 24:34.415
I'm the one; I should go down
on my knees to you.

24:35.425 --> 24:38.189
I was just kidding.
I thought you knew that.

24:41.565 --> 24:43.692
I can't kid about these things...

24:44.734 --> 24:46.634
...because I am nuts about you.

24:47.337 --> 24:51.673
And I would go down on my knees
to worship you if you really wanted me to.

24:52.611 --> 24:54.875
Bud, I can't get along without you.

24:56.682 --> 24:59.116
And I would do anything you'd ask me to.

25:00.018 --> 25:01.076
I would.

25:03.489 --> 25:04.456
I would.

25:05.757 --> 25:06.781
Anything.

25:29.316 --> 25:32.808
- Let's speak of it at the next meeting.
- I certainly will, if you will.

25:33.554 --> 25:35.954
I'm going in to fix supper now.

25:36.090 --> 25:38.083
- Bye-bye, Nell.
- 'Bye, Frieda.

25:56.145 --> 25:57.077
Hi, Mom.

26:06.824 --> 26:08.257
The coast is clear.

26:13.097 --> 26:15.395
Are we going to the victory dance?

26:19.170 --> 26:21.331
I can think of things I'd rather do.

26:30.417 --> 26:31.611
I'll be ready.

26:37.824 --> 26:40.588
I'll pick you up right after dinner then.

26:50.303 --> 26:52.535
Did he tell you about his sister Ginny?

26:52.641 --> 26:53.471
No.

26:53.909 --> 26:56.878
Ginny Stamper is too low
for the dogs to bite.

26:56.979 --> 26:58.037
Come here.

26:58.947 --> 27:03.213
She met some man in Chicago,
put her in the family way.

27:04.186 --> 27:08.213
Mrs. Stamper had to go out there
and get her, take her to a doctor.

27:08.323 --> 27:09.915
Store's all locked up.

27:12.694 --> 27:13.626
Good.

27:15.197 --> 27:18.396
To have one of those
awful operations performed.

27:19.169 --> 27:20.727
Mom, that's gossip.

27:21.705 --> 27:23.366
Every word is true.

27:23.974 --> 27:26.374
I was at the DAR and heard all about it.

27:26.510 --> 27:29.308
Mrs. Whitcomb lives across the street
from the Stampers...

27:29.413 --> 27:32.905
...and she knows everything
that goes on in their house.

27:33.384 --> 27:37.411
That's what happens to girls
who go wild and boy-crazy.

27:53.506 --> 27:55.599
Well, congratulations, Son!

27:56.709 --> 27:59.075
The game, boy, the game.

27:59.545 --> 28:00.739
Thank you.

28:05.051 --> 28:06.985
I'll run along upstairs and...

28:11.592 --> 28:13.321
Dad, I have to talk to you.

28:15.363 --> 28:19.197
I've just about had all the nonsense
I intend to take out of you.

28:24.439 --> 28:28.239
Get out of here, young lady.
I'm gonna have a talk with my boy.

28:35.719 --> 28:36.981
All right, Son.

28:39.656 --> 28:41.123
All right, go ahead.

28:42.926 --> 28:44.416
Dad, I'm gonna marry Deanie.

28:44.527 --> 28:45.653
Whoa now, Son.

28:47.964 --> 28:50.626
You see, I don't really wanna go to Yale.

28:50.834 --> 28:52.461
I'm not a very good student.

28:52.569 --> 28:55.504
What do you mean
you're not a good student?

28:55.972 --> 28:58.738
Boy, you can do anything
you set your mind to do.

28:59.378 --> 29:03.508
I'd like to go to a good agricultural college
for a couple of years.

29:03.615 --> 29:06.675
I'd really like to do that.
I could come right back here...

29:06.785 --> 29:09.083
...and take over your ranch
just south of town.

29:09.187 --> 29:10.552
Ranching's no life.

29:10.655 --> 29:13.089
I could marry Deanie,
take her to college with me.

29:13.191 --> 29:16.592
That's what I really want.
She'd be a big help to me, Dad.

29:16.695 --> 29:21.257
I spent my life trying to create a place
of importance for you in this world...

29:21.400 --> 29:25.168
...then you come home telling me
you want to marry some little girl!

29:25.939 --> 29:27.804
It's what I want that counts.

29:28.809 --> 29:31.835
Son, a boy your age doesn't even know
what he wants.

29:31.945 --> 29:35.244
After you've had a college education,
you might change your mind.

29:35.349 --> 29:37.476
A college education
will take me four years.

29:37.584 --> 29:39.142
- Trust me.
- I do trust you, but-

29:39.253 --> 29:41.619
- Trust me this time, Son.
- I trust you, Dad.

29:41.722 --> 29:44.020
I do trust you, but four years-

29:44.958 --> 29:46.323
Listen to me now.

29:47.060 --> 29:48.154
But, Dad...

29:48.898 --> 29:52.026
Son, all I'm asking you to do is
to finish Yale.

29:52.468 --> 29:57.132
Then if you still want to marry her,
return and marry her with my blessing.

29:57.239 --> 30:00.208
I'll send you both off to Europe
for a honeymoon.

30:00.309 --> 30:02.800
Bud, please wait, Son.

30:02.912 --> 30:05.073
I just don't know if I can, Dad.

30:09.084 --> 30:11.314
I feel like I'm going nuts sometimes.

30:12.657 --> 30:14.284
I understand, Son.

30:15.693 --> 30:17.888
Your old man understands, Son.

30:20.431 --> 30:24.265
What you need for the time being is...

30:25.703 --> 30:27.637
...a different kind of girl.

30:27.772 --> 30:32.334
When I was a boy, Son,
there was always two kinds of girls.

30:33.478 --> 30:37.073
Us boys, we'd never even mention them
in the same breath...

30:37.181 --> 30:41.984
...but every now and then one of us boys
would sneak off with a girl...

30:43.389 --> 30:47.018
...and we'd get a little steam
out of our system.

30:49.262 --> 30:51.253
No girl looks good to me except Deanie.

30:51.364 --> 30:53.025
I know, Son.

30:53.132 --> 30:54.121
I know.

30:56.236 --> 30:57.294
I love her, Dad.

30:57.604 --> 30:59.333
I know, Son, I know.

31:02.075 --> 31:03.908
See, I don't want to do that.

31:20.595 --> 31:22.654
Okay, I'll go to Yale.

31:22.864 --> 31:26.300
But I want to tell you now,
I'll marry her as soon as I get out.

31:26.401 --> 31:27.426
That's a promise.

31:27.538 --> 31:30.098
- I want you to remember that.
- It's a promise.

31:30.207 --> 31:33.540
It's a promise, Son. I'll send you both
off to Europe on a honeymoon.

31:33.644 --> 31:35.305
- That's a promise.
- Okay.

31:43.053 --> 31:44.748
Bud, I'll wait for you.

31:45.489 --> 31:47.286
I'll wait for you forever.

31:49.226 --> 31:51.387
I'll do anything you want, Bud.

31:59.838 --> 32:04.207
Yes, it's a time of great prosperity
for us all, and we must give thanks.

32:06.111 --> 32:09.945
But let us not forget Christ's warning
to the multitude.

32:11.150 --> 32:14.608
"Lay not up treasures for yourselves
on earth...

32:15.654 --> 32:18.216
"... where moth and rust doth corrupt...

32:18.993 --> 32:22.087
"... and where thieves break through
and steal:

32:23.297 --> 32:26.460
"But lay up for yourselves treasures
in heaven...

32:27.268 --> 32:30.294
"... where neither moth nor rust
doth corrupt...

32:30.738 --> 32:34.071
"... and where thieves do not
break through and steal:

32:35.810 --> 32:40.440
"For where your treasure is,
there will your heart be also. "

32:46.289 --> 32:48.314
Fine sermon. Fine sermon.

32:49.926 --> 32:51.860
Let us pray.

32:59.902 --> 33:02.769
Take my advice, Del.
Hang onto those stocks of yours.

33:02.872 --> 33:05.534
This comedian said,
"You ain't seen nothing yet. "

33:05.642 --> 33:07.041
We're hanging on.

33:07.310 --> 33:09.507
Fine sermon, Reverend, fine sermon.

33:10.782 --> 33:12.409
Wonderful passage.

33:20.992 --> 33:23.927
Don't light a cigarette
in front of all these church people!

33:24.029 --> 33:26.259
Do you want me to be a hypocrite?

33:30.201 --> 33:33.764
Who would've thought that one day
our kids would be, well, engaged sort of?

33:33.874 --> 33:36.866
I'm mighty proud
of my son's choice, Frieda.

33:37.711 --> 33:39.906
I'm mighty proud of your boy, too.

33:41.848 --> 33:43.110
Excuse us, honey.

33:43.216 --> 33:45.741
I'll see you at dinner tonight. Don't forget.

33:54.761 --> 33:55.955
Dad, I'm no spy.

33:56.063 --> 34:00.263
All I'm asking you to do is keep an eye
on her while I'm in New York.

34:00.369 --> 34:04.066
She likes you, Son. She won't do
anything crazy when you're around.

34:15.451 --> 34:18.648
Virginia, I told you, your father has
the key to that cabinet...

34:18.754 --> 34:20.915
...and he's on the train to New York.

34:21.023 --> 34:23.322
That's him all over. He keeps it locked.

34:23.427 --> 34:25.793
He doesn't think
anybody should drink but him.

34:25.896 --> 34:27.659
You may be shocking Glenn.

34:28.331 --> 34:31.391
Virginia, after all,
we do have prohibition, you know.

34:31.902 --> 34:34.063
Maybe Glenn doesn't approve of drinking.

34:34.170 --> 34:35.866
Quick, Henry, the flit.

34:38.007 --> 34:40.568
Has your family lived long in town?

34:43.714 --> 34:46.239
They just moved here from Oklahoma.

34:46.417 --> 34:48.216
Oh, I see.

34:49.722 --> 34:52.987
Is your father engaged
in some business in town?

34:57.330 --> 35:01.130
His father is looking for work
and Glenn works at the filling station...

35:01.234 --> 35:04.692
...on the corner of Sycamore and Main.
Anything else you'd like to know?

35:04.804 --> 35:08.137
Ginny, I see no reason at all
for your bad nature.

35:09.275 --> 35:11.505
Bud, you're not eating a thing.

35:11.611 --> 35:12.910
I'm bored!

35:13.615 --> 35:14.946
Come on, let's go.

35:15.250 --> 35:17.150
There's a lovely dessert coming.

35:17.252 --> 35:20.619
I don't want a lovely dessert.
Glenn and I are going for a ride.

35:20.722 --> 35:21.814
Come on.

35:23.792 --> 35:26.090
Deanie and I'll go with you and Glenn.

35:35.403 --> 35:36.461
Wake up.

35:36.671 --> 35:40.632
Hey, Buddy boy, you're a Boy Scout.
Run in and build us a nice, hot fire.

35:40.744 --> 35:42.075
My hair's a mess.

35:42.345 --> 35:43.312
Where?

35:43.680 --> 35:44.578
Here.

35:50.253 --> 35:51.845
Stop it. Stop it.

35:52.789 --> 35:55.019
"Everybody's wild about Mabel

35:55.258 --> 35:57.419
"She's the talk of the town

35:57.561 --> 35:59.722
"Mabel's willing and able

35:59.863 --> 36:02.058
"To show a guy around

36:02.199 --> 36:04.396
"She's a tease, she's a flirt

36:04.636 --> 36:07.196
"You better watch out or you'll get hurt"

36:09.608 --> 36:12.270
Good, Buddy boy.
Now, how about a drink?

36:13.912 --> 36:16.210
I forgot, Buddy boy's in training.

36:16.748 --> 36:18.978
What about you, Deanie girl?
You want a drink?

36:20.118 --> 36:21.608
Come on, Deanie.

36:22.187 --> 36:26.647
Come on, have a little drink. Come on.
Or is Deanie girl in training, too?

36:27.528 --> 36:28.517
Lay off, Ginny.

36:29.597 --> 36:31.326
Why don't you relax?

36:31.599 --> 36:34.090
You're just standing around
like a chaperone.

36:34.201 --> 36:37.898
Is that what you came out here for,
just to chaperone Glenn and me?

36:39.540 --> 36:41.371
Ain't he pretty, Deanie, huh?

36:43.143 --> 36:45.771
My handsome filling-station attendant.

36:46.714 --> 36:48.978
Fill me up, please, I'm empty.

36:53.923 --> 36:55.857
Come on, honey, let's go for a walk.

36:55.958 --> 36:56.925
All right.

36:57.026 --> 36:59.790
Yeah, why don't you go
for a walk upstairs?

37:00.997 --> 37:04.831
Why don't you quit trying to pretend
you're so pure and righteous?

37:04.934 --> 37:06.401
If you weren't my sister-

37:06.502 --> 37:09.266
If I weren't your sister,
you wouldn't do anything.

37:09.372 --> 37:11.863
You never do anything
except what Dad tells you.

37:11.974 --> 37:15.569
Isn't that right, Deanie?
You been finding that out, haven't you?

37:16.012 --> 37:19.279
He just lets things torment him inside
and make him miserable...

37:19.550 --> 37:21.848
...and he never does anything about them.

37:21.953 --> 37:23.853
He never does anything.

37:24.789 --> 37:25.721
'Bye.

37:38.403 --> 37:41.304
All this is gonna be ours someday.

37:49.215 --> 37:51.877
This is the most wonderful Christmas
I've ever had.

37:51.985 --> 37:55.785
Isn't it beautiful? Oh, Dad,
it's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

37:55.889 --> 37:58.255
I wonder what Bud paid for it?

37:58.391 --> 38:00.416
Why do you always think about the cost?

38:00.527 --> 38:03.553
If you want to know,
I wish it was a lot less and was a ring.

38:03.663 --> 38:06.393
- Don't, Mom, don't.
- Four years, you'll be...

38:06.499 --> 38:08.162
All right, all right.

38:09.871 --> 38:12.931
I just wish that Bud Stamper
had a little more gumption.

38:14.843 --> 38:17.004
Always drink plenty of milk, Deanie.

38:18.280 --> 38:19.247
Still.

38:19.514 --> 38:20.572
Still.

38:20.749 --> 38:22.842
One, two. There.

38:23.418 --> 38:24.385
Thank you.

38:24.753 --> 38:25.879
One more, please.

38:25.988 --> 38:28.650
I don't know why I couldn't have had a car.

38:28.824 --> 38:31.384
Why should I buy you a car?
You got your mother's coupe.

38:31.493 --> 38:32.985
That coupe is a wreck.

38:33.097 --> 38:36.555
- What have you done with your hair?
- I just put a henna rinse in it.

38:37.568 --> 38:38.466
Still.

38:39.837 --> 38:40.826
Still.

38:41.038 --> 38:42.164
I'll get it.

38:42.272 --> 38:44.968
One. Two. There.

38:46.543 --> 38:48.067
Thank God that's over.

38:50.881 --> 38:52.576
- Hi, Ginny.
- Oh, Brian.

38:52.950 --> 38:54.781
My parents are in there.

38:58.791 --> 39:00.019
- Perfume?
- Arpege.

39:00.126 --> 39:02.617
It's my favorite.
I just have to slip on my dress.

39:02.728 --> 39:04.719
Come meet the folks. Come on.

39:06.565 --> 39:10.001
They're kind of dull,
but you can stand them for a few minutes.

39:11.337 --> 39:12.326
Go on!

39:16.709 --> 39:19.678
- Hello. I'm Ace Stamper.
- I'm Brian Stacey.

39:19.845 --> 39:22.075
- What can I do for you?
- I'm waiting for Ginny.

39:22.181 --> 39:25.380
She may take forever. Come on in.
This is my son, Bud.

39:25.853 --> 39:27.115
Come here, Son.

39:27.789 --> 39:30.724
The boy's captain of the football team.
You heard about him?

39:30.825 --> 39:32.315
I don't get to many games.

39:32.427 --> 39:33.917
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

39:34.028 --> 39:36.019
This is my wife, Mrs. Stamper.

39:37.465 --> 39:39.092
Won't you come in?

40:05.462 --> 40:07.054
Ginny, I want to talk to you.

40:07.163 --> 40:08.425
Come on in.

40:18.210 --> 40:20.110
Ginny, I know who that guy is.

40:21.913 --> 40:23.312
That guy's a bootlegger.

40:23.415 --> 40:25.007
Is he? Here, do me up.

40:27.152 --> 40:28.813
He's married. Do you know that?

40:28.920 --> 40:31.616
How do you know so much about him,
sweetie-pie?

40:32.190 --> 40:34.522
- You're not going out with him.
- Is that so?

40:34.626 --> 40:36.753
- Try to stop me.
- This is Christmas Day.

40:36.862 --> 40:39.833
You'll stay home and you'll be decent
to your mother.

40:39.933 --> 40:42.265
- You're not leaving!
- Get out of my way!

41:04.226 --> 41:06.524
If you want to listen to Dad, go ahead.

41:08.731 --> 41:10.824
One of these days you'll find out.

41:14.703 --> 41:17.263
You'll find out and then God help you.

41:19.909 --> 41:23.538
All right, calm down, everybody.
Come on now, just calm down!

41:23.679 --> 41:26.876
All right, boys, give me a fanfare.
Give me a fanfare.

41:27.116 --> 41:28.847
You people, shut up in there!

41:32.256 --> 41:34.747
Let's crowd around here,
crowd around here.

41:34.992 --> 41:36.892
We'll bring this New Year in right.

41:43.401 --> 41:44.766
For Joe!

42:01.054 --> 42:02.521
Happy New Year!

42:30.418 --> 42:32.147
You look lovely, boy!

42:32.254 --> 42:34.381
You're the prettiest baby here!

42:45.669 --> 42:47.000
Shake that jelly.

42:49.273 --> 42:51.366
Look, Daddy. Happy New Year!

42:52.075 --> 42:54.339
Shake that jelly. Shake it! Shake it!

42:54.444 --> 42:55.911
Daddy, look at us.

42:57.080 --> 42:58.445
Daddy, look!

42:59.783 --> 43:02.946
Come on, move aside.
Hey, let me through there.

43:03.053 --> 43:06.352
Hey, Smokey boy,
let me ring your doorbell.

43:08.894 --> 43:10.725
Happy New Year, Daddy.

43:12.698 --> 43:14.029
You cut that out!

43:14.400 --> 43:18.268
You behave yourself.
You behave yourself, you hear me?

43:20.406 --> 43:22.931
Mr. Stamper, the perfume is coming in.

43:23.042 --> 43:25.033
Yeah, perfume for all the ladies.

43:25.144 --> 43:27.704
Line up, ladies.
Line up to get your perfume.

43:28.814 --> 43:32.513
Come on, get your perfume,
all you ladies.

43:34.555 --> 43:37.615
Happy New Year, Son.
Go on, get in line. There's some for you.

43:37.725 --> 43:39.716
It will be a great year for both of us.

43:44.432 --> 43:46.923
- Dance with me, Dick?
- No thanks, Ginny.

43:54.442 --> 43:56.535
Boy, oh boy, she's really plastered.

43:56.644 --> 43:57.943
Hello, Bill.

44:00.616 --> 44:02.083
She's disgraceful.

44:03.119 --> 44:04.586
It's all she can do to walk.

44:04.687 --> 44:07.121
Why don't her folks
do something about her?

44:07.223 --> 44:08.986
What did she do to her hair?

44:09.092 --> 44:11.060
Charley, will you dance with me?

44:11.994 --> 44:13.461
Not right now, Ginny.

44:15.365 --> 44:17.390
I didn't know you were married.

44:31.850 --> 44:32.817
Hey, look out!

44:34.719 --> 44:36.687
What do you think you're doing?

44:50.837 --> 44:52.771
Happy New Year, Joe!

44:53.874 --> 44:56.536
Go get your sister, Son,
and take her on home.

44:59.045 --> 45:00.672
- Hey, Sis.
- Happy New Year.

45:00.781 --> 45:02.112
Happy New Year.

45:03.283 --> 45:05.274
- Happy New Year.
- What's happy about it?

45:05.385 --> 45:06.750
You want to dance?

45:12.861 --> 45:14.522
Where are you taking me?

45:17.599 --> 45:20.625
- Where are you taking me?
- Sis, let me take you home.

45:20.736 --> 45:21.361
No!

45:21.537 --> 45:23.471
No, I'm not going home.

45:23.605 --> 45:25.266
- Can I do your dress up?
- No.

45:25.374 --> 45:26.739
You're all unsnapped here.

45:26.842 --> 45:31.438
Get away. I'm not going home.
And you don't have to dance with me.

45:31.580 --> 45:35.016
Ginny, I like to dance
with a good-looking girl once in a while.

45:35.517 --> 45:39.717
If you weren't my brother
you wouldn't even come near me.

45:39.824 --> 45:41.815
You're a nice boy! You're nice!

45:42.560 --> 45:44.357
I know what you nice boys are like.

45:44.462 --> 45:46.487
I know, you only talk to me in the dark!

45:46.697 --> 45:47.755
In the dark!

45:47.865 --> 45:49.628
You talk to me then, don't you?

45:49.733 --> 45:53.260
You talk to me in the dark, in automobiles!
You talk to me!

45:53.370 --> 45:55.895
You're very familiar then, aren't you?

45:56.907 --> 45:58.204
Get away from me!

46:13.726 --> 46:16.058
Joe, where have you been?

46:26.205 --> 46:28.334
- Where's Joe?
- Here I am.

46:39.220 --> 46:41.154
Come on, Joe. Let's go.

46:41.623 --> 46:42.590
Where?

46:45.059 --> 46:45.957
Anywhere!

46:46.060 --> 46:47.425
Let's go, honey.

46:49.264 --> 46:51.198
Happy New Year!

46:54.437 --> 46:55.597
Hey, come on.

47:23.201 --> 47:26.170
Leave me alone. Leave me alone.

47:27.506 --> 47:28.598
I'm dizzy.

47:33.812 --> 47:34.779
No!

47:37.583 --> 47:39.551
Did you see where Arnold went?

47:39.685 --> 47:42.119
- You get stood up, Kay?
- It looks like it.

47:42.254 --> 47:44.247
Bud, would you be an angel, huh?

47:45.559 --> 47:48.960
- I'll love you for the rest of my life.
- I'll go look for him.

48:11.787 --> 48:13.550
Cut it out, it's his sister!

48:14.991 --> 48:16.253
Now lay off, Bill!

48:16.359 --> 48:19.760
Cut it out, I tell you, she's his sister.
He's gone mad.

48:22.765 --> 48:24.562
Stop this fight! Stop this fight!

48:24.667 --> 48:26.931
It wasn't his fault. No one's to blame.

48:30.006 --> 48:31.064
Let's go.

49:21.161 --> 49:23.131
Come on inside a minute. Okay?

49:42.684 --> 49:44.675
- Do you wanna come inside?
- No.

49:44.786 --> 49:48.155
We gotta stop all this kissing
and fooling around, Deanie.

49:49.526 --> 49:51.460
Tell me what's happened.

49:51.595 --> 49:55.156
I just don't think we'd better
see each other for a while.

50:00.637 --> 50:02.366
I have to go. Goodbye.

50:12.818 --> 50:14.718
We planned the whole play around you.

50:14.820 --> 50:17.414
You're supposed to be there.
What's the matter?

50:17.523 --> 50:18.785
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry, my foot!

50:18.891 --> 50:20.722
- You keep training?
- Yes, sir.

50:20.826 --> 50:22.555
- Hours? Diet?
- Yes, sir.

50:22.728 --> 50:24.593
All right, let's try it again.

50:24.730 --> 50:26.493
I said, let's try it again.

50:29.201 --> 50:31.362
I want very much to say this:

50:32.037 --> 50:36.167
I want to give most of you
a high compliment on your term paper.

50:37.511 --> 50:40.504
They're the best set of papers
I've ever received.

50:58.800 --> 50:59.596
Bud?

50:59.934 --> 51:01.162
Just a minute.

51:07.811 --> 51:10.143
There's something I've got to tell you.

51:10.513 --> 51:13.539
Your term paper was not very good.

51:14.517 --> 51:15.814
Well, I guess so.

51:15.919 --> 51:18.319
Remember, you've got to do much better...

51:18.421 --> 51:21.185
...if you're going to get into Yale in the fall.

51:28.366 --> 51:29.333
Hi.

51:30.936 --> 51:32.301
I miss you, Bud.

51:37.576 --> 51:40.272
I just wanted to wish you good luck
on the game.

51:40.712 --> 51:41.838
Thanks.

52:14.581 --> 52:15.775
Dr. Smiley.

52:25.628 --> 52:26.925
- Doc?
- Yes, Bud.

52:27.096 --> 52:29.087
- What happened?
- You tell me.

52:29.331 --> 52:31.231
What do you want? What is it?

52:31.333 --> 52:32.664
What's wrong with him?

52:32.768 --> 52:35.794
He just had a fall.
There's nothing to worry about at all.

52:35.905 --> 52:40.069
104Â°. I recommend the hospital.
There's a lot of pneumonia around.

52:40.175 --> 52:41.938
- Pneumonia?
- My God!

52:46.517 --> 52:47.643
Yes, I know.

52:58.062 --> 53:00.155
I've signed my name to this check.

53:00.598 --> 53:03.192
Pull my boy through
and I'm willing to give you a bonus.

53:03.301 --> 53:05.701
You just fill out the amount,
$5,000, $10,000-

53:05.803 --> 53:07.602
I'm doing everything that can be done.

53:07.707 --> 53:09.231
You just fill out the amount.

53:09.342 --> 53:12.709
I think the boy's going to be all right,
but if he isn't...

53:13.346 --> 53:15.007
What do you mean, "if he isn't"?

53:15.114 --> 53:19.073
Ace, I'm not a very religious man,
but I know what every doctor knows.

53:22.488 --> 53:24.718
You can't reckon with the will of God.

53:27.660 --> 53:30.561
Just say whatever is in your heart,
Wilma Dean.

53:30.730 --> 53:34.862
All I can think of is, "Dear God,
make him well, make him well. "

53:35.770 --> 53:37.704
Then that's your prayer.

53:38.840 --> 53:42.139
But aren't there some words I should say
out of the Bible?

53:43.111 --> 53:46.410
I can't think of any that would be better
than your own.

54:03.800 --> 54:06.894
Oh, please, God, make him well.

54:09.039 --> 54:10.438
Make him well.

54:24.690 --> 54:28.683
Well, Bud, in another week or so
you'll be feeling yourself again.

54:29.228 --> 54:30.923
Then spring will be here.

54:31.563 --> 54:35.294
You know what happens
to a young man's fancy in the springtime.

54:38.604 --> 54:41.266
- You go with Del Loomis' girl, don't you?
- Yeah.

54:42.374 --> 54:43.932
Mighty attractive girl.

54:44.810 --> 54:45.970
She sure is.

54:50.684 --> 54:54.017
- I'm pretty nuts about Deanie Loomis.
- I don't blame you.

54:54.221 --> 54:55.745
I mean, I love her.

54:57.291 --> 54:58.690
And she loves me.

55:01.896 --> 55:04.421
But it's no fun to be in love. It hurts.

55:06.100 --> 55:08.125
Every time that we're together...

55:10.604 --> 55:12.128
...I have to...

55:14.343 --> 55:16.368
...remember things.
You know what I mean?

55:16.479 --> 55:17.377
Oh, yes.

55:17.480 --> 55:21.143
I just can't go back to seeing her again.

55:22.618 --> 55:26.384
Not like the way we were doing.
We'd go out every night and...

55:29.659 --> 55:32.287
...I'd hold her and I'd kiss her and...

55:34.163 --> 55:35.653
...I'd just go home.

55:37.735 --> 55:40.135
I mean, a guy can go nuts that way.

55:42.941 --> 55:45.876
I don't know how to advise you, Bud.

55:54.185 --> 55:55.379
My dad said...

55:58.189 --> 56:00.783
...that I should get another kind of a girl.

56:02.060 --> 56:02.892
No.

56:05.599 --> 56:08.261
But when you don't really want
another girl...

56:09.269 --> 56:10.099
No.

56:13.507 --> 56:14.701
I don't know.

56:19.279 --> 56:22.442
Come in again Friday, Bud.
I'll give you another shot of iron...

56:22.549 --> 56:24.449
...and another sun-lamp treatment.

56:30.659 --> 56:31.683
Okay, Doc.

56:33.595 --> 56:34.584
So long.

57:25.985 --> 57:27.043
Hi, Deanie.

57:29.655 --> 57:31.782
And that was the surest way to lose him.

57:31.891 --> 57:33.222
What did you say?

57:33.626 --> 57:35.389
- He's an animal.
- He is not.

57:35.728 --> 57:37.992
- Yes, he is. I met him.
- You don't know him.

57:38.097 --> 57:39.621
Who's an animal?

57:48.509 --> 57:50.067
- You're out.
- I am not.

57:50.178 --> 57:51.236
Yes, you are.

57:51.346 --> 57:54.406
- I hurt my finger.
- I'll kiss it and make it better.

58:30.920 --> 58:34.221
"What though the radiance
which was once so bright

58:34.926 --> 58:37.486
"Is now for ever taken from my sight...

58:38.797 --> 58:42.665
"Though nothing can bring back the hour
Of splendor in the grass...

58:42.768 --> 58:44.668
"... of glory in the flower;

58:45.971 --> 58:49.134
"We will grieve not, rather find

58:49.808 --> 58:52.299
"Strength in what remains behind... "

58:57.316 --> 59:00.446
What do you suppose the poet means
by these lines?

59:11.198 --> 59:12.165
Deanie Loomis?

59:16.570 --> 59:18.197
I'm sorry, Miss Metcalf.

59:21.342 --> 59:22.777
I didn't hear the question.

59:22.978 --> 59:26.209
I know it's spring but I must ask you
to pay more attention.

59:27.049 --> 59:28.243
I'm sorry.

59:28.684 --> 59:33.121
I quoted some lines from Wordsworth's
Ode on Intimations of Immortality.

59:33.222 --> 59:34.280
Did you hear them?

59:37.259 --> 59:39.159
I'm afraid not, Miss Metcalf.

59:39.261 --> 59:41.991
Then I must ask you to turn your text
to Page 380.

59:54.045 --> 59:55.137
Yes, I...

59:58.416 --> 01:00:00.077
You read the lines to me.

01:00:00.885 --> 01:00:01.783
Yes.

01:00:04.922 --> 01:00:06.287
Stand please.

01:00:16.736 --> 01:00:19.466
"Though nothing can bring back the hour

01:00:19.572 --> 01:00:21.472
"Of splendor in the grass...

01:00:21.841 --> 01:00:23.570
"... of glory in the flower;

01:00:24.244 --> 01:00:27.611
"We will grieve not, rather find

01:00:29.149 --> 01:00:33.882
"Strength in what remains behind... "

01:00:34.954 --> 01:00:37.550
Perhaps you can tell me
exactly what the poet means...

01:00:37.659 --> 01:00:40.150
...by such expressions as
"splendor in the grass"...

01:00:40.262 --> 01:00:42.196
...and "glory in the flower. "

01:00:50.439 --> 01:00:52.066
I think it has some...

01:00:53.074 --> 01:00:53.972
Yes?

01:00:58.814 --> 01:01:00.509
Well, when we're young...

01:01:01.450 --> 01:01:05.320
...we look at things very idealistically,
I guess.

01:01:12.296 --> 01:01:14.423
And I think Wordsworth means...

01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:18.795
...that when we grow up...

01:01:25.676 --> 01:01:29.876
...that we have to forget
the ideals of youth...

01:01:31.884 --> 01:01:33.647
...and find strength...

01:01:47.032 --> 01:01:48.294
Miss Metcalf...

01:01:49.134 --> 01:01:50.658
...may I please be...

01:02:02.817 --> 01:02:03.943
Children!

01:02:04.285 --> 01:02:06.276
I'll go see what's the matter.

01:02:17.031 --> 01:02:18.432
- Hi, June.
- Hi.

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:22.003
I just gave her a sedative.

01:02:22.105 --> 01:02:24.835
- I'm not sick.
- She'll be all right in a little while.

01:02:24.941 --> 01:02:26.067
Now lie down.

01:02:26.175 --> 01:02:28.666
I'm all right. I'm perfectly all right.

01:02:28.778 --> 01:02:30.040
Stop that.

01:02:32.115 --> 01:02:33.514
I'm all right.

01:02:42.025 --> 01:02:45.588
I don't care if his father is making
my folks rich. I hate Bud Stamper.

01:02:45.697 --> 01:02:48.165
- You'd take a date if he asked you.
- I would not.

01:02:48.266 --> 01:02:50.791
- You know you would.
- I absolutely would not.

01:02:50.902 --> 01:02:52.164
Here he comes.

01:02:54.306 --> 01:02:55.204
Hi.

01:02:59.411 --> 01:03:00.435
All right.

01:03:19.166 --> 01:03:21.634
Why aren't you going out
for track this year?

01:03:21.735 --> 01:03:24.169
Got all that work to make up
from when I was sick.

01:03:24.271 --> 01:03:27.365
You going to Yale? You going to Yale?

01:03:27.507 --> 01:03:29.771
Yeah, if my grades are good enough.

01:03:31.211 --> 01:03:33.681
How come you're not dating Deanie
anymore?

01:03:33.782 --> 01:03:34.976
I'm just not.

01:03:35.150 --> 01:03:39.018
I guess I'll just go to cow college.
I'm only a farmer and I know it.

01:03:39.121 --> 01:03:41.089
Hot dog! Now it's my chance.

01:03:42.391 --> 01:03:43.653
Any objections?

01:03:48.430 --> 01:03:49.761
I can't stop you.

01:04:02.613 --> 01:04:05.446
Deanie! Come on, honey, supper's ready.

01:04:13.858 --> 01:04:15.792
Deanie! Come on, honey.

01:04:20.498 --> 01:04:23.560
Deanie, come on! Supper's getting cold!

01:04:29.142 --> 01:04:32.703
Veal roast, mashed potatoes
and succotash for my girl.

01:04:32.979 --> 01:04:35.573
Eat a good meal, Deanie.
Make you feel better.

01:04:36.215 --> 01:04:39.412
Always drink plenty of milk, Deanie.

01:04:55.370 --> 01:04:56.667
Eat your dinner.

01:04:57.172 --> 01:05:01.108
Seventy-six and three-eighths!
What do you know about that, huh?

01:05:01.209 --> 01:05:05.703
Seventy-six and three-eighths! Oh, Del!
Did you hear that, Deanie?

01:05:05.947 --> 01:05:07.847
We are rich! We are rich!

01:05:14.224 --> 01:05:16.749
I'll bet the Stampers are feeling good
these days.

01:05:16.860 --> 01:05:21.194
Honey, we'll send you to college.
We'll get a new car. That I promise.

01:05:21.298 --> 01:05:23.732
Saw young Stamper driving this afternoon.

01:05:23.834 --> 01:05:27.668
Crowd of boys in the car.
Brand new car his father got him.

01:05:34.578 --> 01:05:37.206
Deanie, stop it! Stop carrying on this way!

01:05:44.890 --> 01:05:47.358
Mom, I can't eat. I can't study.

01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:50.856
I can't even face my friends anymore.

01:05:51.363 --> 01:05:53.923
I wanna die. I wanna die.

01:06:05.246 --> 01:06:07.043
Do you feel better, dear?

01:06:08.916 --> 01:06:10.042
Oh, yes.

01:06:11.719 --> 01:06:12.686
Oh, yes.

01:06:15.055 --> 01:06:16.920
Nothing like a good soak.

01:06:17.892 --> 01:06:22.454
Deanie, tell me,
what's been the matter the past few days?

01:06:25.866 --> 01:06:27.733
I'm sorry I've troubled you.

01:06:29.438 --> 01:06:31.303
I don't want to worry you.

01:06:32.742 --> 01:06:34.642
I don't want to worry anyone.

01:06:34.844 --> 01:06:37.813
Is it all on account of... because of Bud?

01:06:38.614 --> 01:06:41.139
Because he doesn't call for you anymore?

01:06:42.418 --> 01:06:43.715
I don't know.

01:06:45.388 --> 01:06:47.117
I don't know, Mom.

01:06:47.290 --> 01:06:49.121
I want to call him and tell him-

01:06:49.225 --> 01:06:53.391
Don't you dare! Don't you dare, Mom!
Don't you dare!

01:06:53.498 --> 01:06:54.465
I won't!

01:06:59.003 --> 01:07:03.736
Mother, you do something like that,
I'll do something desperate!

01:07:04.542 --> 01:07:07.306
I will! I will, Mom! I will!

01:07:10.315 --> 01:07:12.806
Deanie, how serious have
you and Bud become?

01:07:14.752 --> 01:07:15.810
I mean...

01:07:17.121 --> 01:07:18.385
You know what I mean.

01:07:24.364 --> 01:07:26.264
Had anything serious happened?

01:07:31.571 --> 01:07:32.663
Did he spoil you?

01:07:34.107 --> 01:07:35.074
Spoil?

01:07:36.209 --> 01:07:38.074
Did he spoil me? No!

01:07:45.954 --> 01:07:48.582
No, Mom! I'm not spoiled!

01:07:48.991 --> 01:07:50.515
I'm not spoiled, Mom!

01:07:51.526 --> 01:07:54.927
I'm just as fresh and virginal
like the day I was born, Mom!

01:07:55.030 --> 01:07:56.088
Stop it! Stop it!

01:07:56.198 --> 01:07:58.758
I'm a virgin who wouldn't think
of being spoiled!

01:07:58.867 --> 01:08:01.028
- Stop it, please!
- I've been a good little girl!

01:08:01.136 --> 01:08:03.070
A good little, good little girl!

01:08:03.171 --> 01:08:05.503
I've always done everything
Daddy and Mommy told me!

01:08:05.607 --> 01:08:06.904
I've obeyed every word!

01:08:07.009 --> 01:08:09.377
I hate you! I hate you! I hate you!

01:08:14.418 --> 01:08:16.886
- Help me.
- What's wrong? People can hear her.

01:08:16.987 --> 01:08:18.045
What will we do?

01:08:19.256 --> 01:08:20.723
Leave me alone!

01:08:21.158 --> 01:08:22.625
What'll we do with her?

01:08:22.725 --> 01:08:24.557
Give her some of that medicine.

01:08:24.662 --> 01:08:26.425
I hate to give it to her so often.

01:08:26.529 --> 01:08:30.022
I'm not spoiled! I'm not spoiled!

01:08:30.401 --> 01:08:31.959
What else can we do?

01:08:38.243 --> 01:08:41.270
Open this door, dear.
Deanie, open the door.

01:08:42.581 --> 01:08:44.014
What are you doing?

01:08:48.921 --> 01:08:52.687
Maybe we should take her to Wichita
like Doc Smiley suggested.

01:08:52.792 --> 01:08:54.259
A psychiatrist?

01:08:57.832 --> 01:09:00.300
It'll take money,
but I'll sell the stocks if I must.

01:09:00.401 --> 01:09:03.962
I can't believe it's that serious.
She's bound to get over it in time.

01:09:04.072 --> 01:09:07.529
There's never been any mental trouble
in either of our families.

01:09:18.252 --> 01:09:19.310
Who's this?

01:09:20.354 --> 01:09:22.220
Probably one of her school friends.

01:09:24.761 --> 01:09:27.286
How do you do, folks?
My name is Alan Tuttle.

01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:28.761
They call me Toots.

01:09:28.865 --> 01:09:31.231
Yes, I've heard Deanie speak of you.

01:09:31.334 --> 01:09:32.301
How do you do?

01:09:32.402 --> 01:09:35.166
I thought I'd drop in
and say hello to Deanie.

01:09:40.777 --> 01:09:41.835
Hi, Deanie.

01:09:43.446 --> 01:09:44.470
Hi, Toots.

01:09:46.916 --> 01:09:48.680
How are you feeling, Deanie?

01:09:49.453 --> 01:09:50.751
I feel all right.

01:09:51.790 --> 01:09:55.783
If you two young folks will pardon us...
It's almost time for supper.

01:09:56.928 --> 01:09:58.657
Very nice to have met you, folks.

01:10:01.166 --> 01:10:03.134
What have you done to your hair?

01:10:04.503 --> 01:10:06.528
Enjoyed meeting you, too, Toots.

01:10:08.106 --> 01:10:12.133
I've been meaning to come for a long time
to see how you were getting along.

01:10:14.581 --> 01:10:15.809
Thanks, Toots.

01:10:17.885 --> 01:10:18.852
You look fine.

01:10:18.952 --> 01:10:20.943
But she's out there in her robe.

01:10:22.923 --> 01:10:24.254
Thank you, Toots.

01:10:30.864 --> 01:10:32.798
So I was wondering if maybe...

01:10:34.268 --> 01:10:36.862
...you would like to go to the dance.

01:10:41.210 --> 01:10:44.577
I'd probably be an awful drip
at the dance, Toots.

01:10:45.448 --> 01:10:47.313
Why don't you say you'll go?

01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:52.016
And if anything happens, you change
your mind or you don't feel like it...

01:11:04.902 --> 01:11:06.164
Have a wonderful time.

01:11:06.270 --> 01:11:09.296
- I'll take good care of her, Mrs. Loomis.
- Thank you.

01:11:13.511 --> 01:11:14.808
Good night, Deanie.

01:11:14.912 --> 01:11:16.106
Good night.

01:11:16.214 --> 01:11:17.943
I'll leave the door open.

01:11:18.616 --> 01:11:21.414
And, Deanie, don't stay out too late.

01:11:23.387 --> 01:11:25.753
"Don't stay out too late. "
Did you hear her?

01:11:25.857 --> 01:11:28.293
She's been saying that
ever since I was knee high.

01:11:28.394 --> 01:11:32.592
I used to think it meant something,
but it doesn't. Doesn't mean a thing.

01:11:48.681 --> 01:11:50.672
Hello, Deanie. Glad to see you.

01:11:52.385 --> 01:11:54.218
- Hello, Toots.
- Hello, Coach.

01:12:05.534 --> 01:12:08.765
You look just beautiful. Look at your hair.

01:12:09.337 --> 01:12:11.771
- Your dress is beautiful.
- You look gorgeous.

01:12:30.027 --> 01:12:32.962
He's here. And guess who with? Kay.

01:12:45.911 --> 01:12:47.902
Would you dance with me, Toots?

01:12:49.014 --> 01:12:50.743
All right with you, Deanie?

01:12:52.818 --> 01:12:53.807
Sure.

01:12:54.653 --> 01:12:55.881
Sure, go ahead.

01:12:56.322 --> 01:12:57.289
Come on.

01:13:07.902 --> 01:13:09.369
How are you, Deanie?

01:13:10.605 --> 01:13:13.073
All right, I guess. I don't know.

01:13:16.143 --> 01:13:17.269
How are you?

01:13:18.346 --> 01:13:19.779
All right, I guess.

01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:26.709
You like?

01:13:30.858 --> 01:13:32.919
Come on outside for a cigarette.

01:13:33.096 --> 01:13:34.028
Okay.

01:13:38.768 --> 01:13:40.565
When did you start smoking?

01:13:41.204 --> 01:13:44.230
The past few weeks.
I had to do something.

01:13:44.774 --> 01:13:47.902
Mom had a fit, but she doesn't
say anything anymore.

01:13:57.353 --> 01:13:59.186
I know why you quit coming by.

01:13:59.291 --> 01:14:02.192
- Let's not talk about it.
- I've got to talk about it.

01:14:02.294 --> 01:14:05.627
All I've done the past couple of months
is just sit home...

01:14:05.797 --> 01:14:07.059
...and think about it.

01:14:07.165 --> 01:14:08.757
Hey, get out of there.

01:14:08.867 --> 01:14:12.359
You said you wouldn't see him anymore,
and here you are in his car.

01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:14.700
Deanie, I want to tell you something.

01:14:16.074 --> 01:14:20.511
Every night after dinner I force myself
from going to the telephone and calling.

01:14:22.916 --> 01:14:25.384
Deanie, I think about you all the time.

01:14:30.357 --> 01:14:31.654
Where's your car?

01:14:34.761 --> 01:14:35.728
Come on.

01:14:46.139 --> 01:14:48.234
Please, Bud. Please.

01:14:48.744 --> 01:14:49.938
Deanie, cut it out.

01:14:50.045 --> 01:14:51.137
Now, Bud.

01:14:51.580 --> 01:14:53.445
Deanie, you're a nice girl.

01:14:54.583 --> 01:14:55.641
I'm not.

01:14:57.286 --> 01:14:58.913
I'm not a nice girl.

01:14:59.221 --> 01:15:00.654
Come on, cut it out.

01:15:00.756 --> 01:15:03.452
I just can't go on like this anymore.

01:15:05.094 --> 01:15:07.494
Now come on, we're gonna go back inside.

01:15:07.663 --> 01:15:09.597
No, I don't want to go back inside.

01:15:09.698 --> 01:15:12.326
I want to stay here with you. I want you!

01:15:12.435 --> 01:15:14.563
- This isn't the way it should be.
- Why not?

01:15:14.672 --> 01:15:17.505
- Why not? Why don't you want it?
- You're not yourself.

01:15:17.608 --> 01:15:19.235
Deanie, where's your pride?

01:15:19.343 --> 01:15:21.971
My pride? My pride?

01:15:22.947 --> 01:15:25.279
- I don't care about my pride!
- Deanie, stop it!

01:15:25.383 --> 01:15:27.749
Stop it, Deanie! Deanie, stop!

01:15:28.252 --> 01:15:31.016
Go on, go on! I haven't any pride!

01:15:31.389 --> 01:15:32.549
I haven't any pride!

01:15:32.656 --> 01:15:35.523
Oh, God! What am I gonna do with you?

01:15:38.097 --> 01:15:40.088
I don't care what you do.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:42.695
I don't care what happens!

01:15:43.202 --> 01:15:44.669
I haven't any pride!

01:15:48.674 --> 01:15:51.871
I just want to die! I just want to die!

01:16:06.127 --> 01:16:08.652
Take me away from here. Take me away.

01:16:26.648 --> 01:16:28.140
It's okay. Come on.

01:17:30.150 --> 01:17:34.280
I put some bread on to set.
We'll have homemade bread for a few days.

01:17:35.689 --> 01:17:37.589
What are you thinking about, Del?

01:17:37.691 --> 01:17:39.591
I'm worrying about our little girl.

01:17:39.693 --> 01:17:44.530
She's all right now. She's at the dance.
I'll bet you she's having the time of her life.

01:17:44.634 --> 01:17:45.931
Drink your milk.

01:17:47.203 --> 01:17:48.227
Stop it!

01:17:50.706 --> 01:17:51.798
Stop it!

01:17:53.276 --> 01:17:54.937
Don't, Bud, don't!

01:17:56.245 --> 01:17:57.212
Bud?

01:18:02.318 --> 01:18:05.048
Deanie, come back here!
Where are you going?

01:18:13.932 --> 01:18:15.297
Deanie, come back!

01:18:17.669 --> 01:18:18.636
Stop it!

01:18:36.623 --> 01:18:38.181
Deanie, come back here!

01:19:29.446 --> 01:19:31.209
Hey, you can't go up there!

01:19:31.915 --> 01:19:33.746
Hey, you, come back here!

01:19:36.286 --> 01:19:37.878
Hey, you, come back here!

01:19:37.988 --> 01:19:39.387
Isn't that Deanie Loomis?

01:19:39.490 --> 01:19:41.390
What's the matter with you? Come here!

01:19:41.859 --> 01:19:44.123
What's the matter with you? Come here!

01:20:08.821 --> 01:20:10.982
She dove in. What's wrong with that girl?

01:20:38.221 --> 01:20:40.416
Get away! Leave me alone!

01:20:47.897 --> 01:20:51.697
She hasn't spoken a word of sense
since they brought her in here.

01:20:53.703 --> 01:20:55.330
Stay close to her.

01:20:59.709 --> 01:21:01.506
- Any word?
- No, not yet.

01:21:05.650 --> 01:21:06.639
Not yet.

01:21:09.488 --> 01:21:10.455
Not yet.

01:21:11.089 --> 01:21:13.683
My baby. Why did she do it?

01:21:18.196 --> 01:21:19.993
I don't want to see you ever again.

01:21:20.098 --> 01:21:21.395
Mama, quit talking like that.

01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:24.867
I don't care. He's the cause
of all her trouble.

01:21:26.138 --> 01:21:27.127
He's the cause.

01:21:28.909 --> 01:21:31.707
- What did you do to her tonight?
- No, Mama!

01:21:32.546 --> 01:21:34.070
I want him to answer me.

01:21:34.181 --> 01:21:35.910
She doesn't mean what she says.

01:21:36.016 --> 01:21:37.244
I do, too.

01:21:39.586 --> 01:21:42.555
My little girl. I want my little girl.

01:21:43.056 --> 01:21:44.819
Mama, quit getting all worked up.

01:21:44.925 --> 01:21:47.086
How can I help getting worked up...

01:21:47.694 --> 01:21:51.755
...when my baby, my baby lies there
fighting for her life?

01:21:54.503 --> 01:21:56.528
Frieda, I'm sorry.

01:21:56.972 --> 01:21:59.941
By george, Del,
I'm sorry to hear about this.

01:22:09.084 --> 01:22:12.747
- Is she all right?
- They don't know what's the matter yet.

01:22:17.293 --> 01:22:19.763
Your daughter is
in a very nervous condition.

01:22:19.864 --> 01:22:22.765
- Can I see my baby?
- No, not now. Perhaps tomorrow.

01:22:23.267 --> 01:22:25.792
Have you thought about
what I suggested to you?

01:22:25.903 --> 01:22:28.269
Yes. I'm going through with it.

01:22:29.173 --> 01:22:33.303
I'll sell those stocks and send her off
to Wichita as soon as she's ready to leave.

01:22:33.411 --> 01:22:35.902
Good. I'll make the arrangements for you.

01:22:38.316 --> 01:22:40.546
It's time you and I were home in bed.

01:22:42.220 --> 01:22:46.124
I'm gonna marry Deanie.
I don't care what he says, Doc.

01:22:48.595 --> 01:22:50.688
- Good night, Bud.
- Good night, Mr. Loomis.

01:22:50.797 --> 01:22:54.528
I'm of legal age. I don't care what he says,
I'm gonna marry her.

01:23:29.738 --> 01:23:33.232
Bud, do you want to help Deanie?
Then stay away from her.

01:23:35.312 --> 01:23:37.246
- For how long?
- I don't know.

01:23:37.347 --> 01:23:39.315
I don't know now. No one does.

01:24:04.677 --> 01:24:05.905
Who's that?

01:24:08.814 --> 01:24:10.805
Who's there? Who's there?

01:24:11.016 --> 01:24:12.950
There's nobody. Nobody.

01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:17.850
There was somebody here.
Somebody was here.

01:24:18.590 --> 01:24:19.921
Somebody was here.

01:24:34.241 --> 01:24:36.766
You have another letter from your father.

01:24:59.702 --> 01:25:03.035
I'm beginning to think you want
to be thrown out of school.

01:25:44.084 --> 01:25:46.518
Angelina, do you think I could have...

01:25:48.522 --> 01:25:50.285
...another one of these home brew?

01:25:51.091 --> 01:25:53.855
Mister, you drink! You're gonna get sick.

01:25:56.029 --> 01:25:59.487
Let me bring you some food.
Would you like something to eat?

01:26:00.767 --> 01:26:04.034
My mother's making some pizza.
Would you like some pizza?

01:26:05.374 --> 01:26:06.534
What is pizza?

01:26:06.909 --> 01:26:09.742
You don't know what pizza is?
Where are you from?

01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:12.372
From Kansas.

01:26:15.184 --> 01:26:16.173
Where is that?

01:26:18.353 --> 01:26:20.617
It's right in the middle of the USA.

01:26:26.128 --> 01:26:28.064
So that's where your home is.

01:26:30.234 --> 01:26:32.099
Is it nice out there in Kansas?

01:26:35.773 --> 01:26:36.740
Yep.

01:26:41.112 --> 01:26:42.545
It's very friendly.

01:26:44.949 --> 01:26:47.213
That's what it's like, it's friendly.

01:26:47.852 --> 01:26:51.344
Everybody knows your name
and they know who you are and...

01:26:53.259 --> 01:26:54.851
Why don't you go back?

01:26:56.629 --> 01:26:58.529
You must have a sweetheart out there.

01:27:00.900 --> 01:27:01.889
I did.

01:27:09.175 --> 01:27:10.642
Come in the kitchen with me.

01:27:11.110 --> 01:27:13.169
Mama will give you some pizza.

01:27:21.356 --> 01:27:22.687
Have some pizza.

01:27:23.158 --> 01:27:24.147
Come on.

01:27:31.966 --> 01:27:33.797
That's fine, you're up.

01:27:35.270 --> 01:27:36.498
You all right?

01:27:41.176 --> 01:27:42.040
What?

01:27:44.047 --> 01:27:45.742
Are you all right, mister?

01:27:46.349 --> 01:27:47.543
Sure you are.

01:27:51.154 --> 01:27:54.214
Sit on that bench.
I'll be right with you. All right?

01:27:56.326 --> 01:27:58.317
No, that's for Mr. Mangialomino.

01:28:09.741 --> 01:28:11.641
What do you think about that?

01:28:11.743 --> 01:28:14.837
Squint your eyes a bit.
What would CÃ©zanne say to that?

01:28:14.947 --> 01:28:16.209
That's swell, Deanie.

01:28:19.618 --> 01:28:22.314
I never thought I could do this well, really.

01:28:22.421 --> 01:28:24.753
It looks better with one eye closed.

01:28:26.758 --> 01:28:27.725
Oh, you!

01:28:30.729 --> 01:28:34.428
I like metalwork, though. You can
get rid of a lot of hostilities this way.

01:28:34.535 --> 01:28:35.502
Watch.

01:28:37.438 --> 01:28:40.532
Every time I pound,
I tell myself it's my old man.

01:28:44.345 --> 01:28:47.712
My old man had his heart set on
my being a surgeon.

01:28:48.549 --> 01:28:52.417
Well, not just a surgeon
but the greatest surgeon who ever lived.

01:28:56.423 --> 01:28:59.690
So, anyway, I couldn't make that first cut.

01:29:01.497 --> 01:29:04.728
That first cut into the flesh
of another man's body.

01:29:05.434 --> 01:29:08.403
I shook. I couldn't keep my hands steady.

01:29:09.305 --> 01:29:12.035
You can still be an M.D.
when you get out, though.

01:29:12.141 --> 01:29:13.768
If I ever get out.

01:29:14.610 --> 01:29:16.510
Johnny, don't talk like that.

01:29:16.712 --> 01:29:18.339
I'm kidding, I hope.

01:29:18.447 --> 01:29:21.109
Deanie, your parents are
in the waiting room.

01:29:21.317 --> 01:29:23.014
Mother and Dad are here?

01:29:27.825 --> 01:29:32.262
My folks are here. I haven't seen them
for six months. Not since I've been here.

01:29:40.605 --> 01:29:43.165
I hope these people know
what they're doing.

01:29:43.308 --> 01:29:46.243
How much longer are they going
to keep her here?

01:29:49.449 --> 01:29:50.916
Here she comes.

01:30:01.661 --> 01:30:03.959
Don't let Deanie see you looking this way.

01:30:13.809 --> 01:30:17.802
- My baby! My little baby!
- Hi, Mother. It's good to see you.

01:30:18.447 --> 01:30:21.382
Daddy! It's so good to see you.

01:30:21.483 --> 01:30:24.247
Doesn't she look just fine, Del?

01:30:24.419 --> 01:30:27.752
They can't tell me there's anything wrong
with my little baby.

01:30:27.856 --> 01:30:30.450
She's just as sound and normal
as the next one-

01:30:30.559 --> 01:30:32.652
I brought our little girl a box of candy.

01:30:32.761 --> 01:30:34.058
Thank you, Daddy.

01:30:34.496 --> 01:30:37.865
All the girls in your old gang
wanted to tell you hello.

01:30:38.102 --> 01:30:40.764
Your father had to go
and tell everyone where you are.

01:30:40.871 --> 01:30:42.634
I'm not ashamed, Mom.

01:30:42.806 --> 01:30:43.830
Sit down.

01:30:47.611 --> 01:30:49.670
Well, now lets see.

01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:53.179
Kay's gone off to Miss Finch's school.
Very elegant.

01:30:53.283 --> 01:30:56.150
Her folks are very wealthy now, you know.

01:30:56.587 --> 01:31:00.546
And June. June calls about you
every week or so.

01:31:00.691 --> 01:31:03.093
- I guess you know she married Bob.
- Yes.

01:31:03.229 --> 01:31:08.724
Carolyn and June are off at the university.
Now Carolyn pledged Pi Phi.

01:31:09.001 --> 01:31:12.232
Hazel pledged Kappa. Which is better?

01:31:13.639 --> 01:31:16.904
- I don't know.
- The university isn't far from here.

01:31:24.116 --> 01:31:27.381
Maybe you'd like them to come
and see you some Saturday.

01:31:31.926 --> 01:31:33.757
I don't think so, Mom.

01:31:36.063 --> 01:31:38.964
No, no, I guess not.

01:31:39.700 --> 01:31:42.328
I guess it wouldn't be... suitable.

01:31:46.274 --> 01:31:49.937
There's nothing the matter with you,
you just remember that.

01:31:50.978 --> 01:31:54.780
You are perfectly all right.

01:31:55.919 --> 01:32:00.788
Just as well off as Kay or June or Hazel
or any of those girls.

01:32:19.110 --> 01:32:20.270
Maybe...

01:32:27.252 --> 01:32:31.382
Deanie, would you like to have dinner
with us tonight down at the hotel?

01:32:37.429 --> 01:32:40.227
Deanie's had a very trying day,
she's too tired.

01:32:40.365 --> 01:32:42.162
Yes, I'm awfully...

01:32:43.937 --> 01:32:46.303
We're not gonna see any more of you?

01:32:50.143 --> 01:32:52.475
This is all we get to see of you?

01:32:54.615 --> 01:32:56.082
Mom, I'm sorry.

01:33:02.890 --> 01:33:06.257
We drove all the way up here
just to be with our baby.

01:33:07.094 --> 01:33:09.564
Now they tell us we can't be
with her tonight.

01:33:09.665 --> 01:33:13.226
You want what's best for your daughter,
don't you, Mrs. Loomis?

01:33:14.737 --> 01:33:15.726
Yes.

01:33:17.273 --> 01:33:19.969
Yes, I want what's best for my daughter.

01:33:21.343 --> 01:33:23.504
We'll take our little girl out to dinner...

01:33:23.612 --> 01:33:24.806
I'm sorry.

01:33:34.759 --> 01:33:36.954
...the next time we come up, Mama.

01:33:38.829 --> 01:33:41.127
Mom kept calling me her baby...

01:33:41.532 --> 01:33:44.990
...and Dad kept calling me his little girl.

01:33:48.406 --> 01:33:51.000
Dr. Judd, don't they realize I'm me?

01:33:52.476 --> 01:33:55.309
You're the one that's got to change.
They can't.

01:33:55.913 --> 01:33:58.645
I don't think I could ever go
back home again.

01:33:58.751 --> 01:34:02.448
I don't think I can feel the same way
I used to feel about them.

01:34:02.589 --> 01:34:07.151
You'll just have to accept them as people,
with a lot of faults maybe...

01:34:07.994 --> 01:34:10.155
...but not as Mama and Papa.

01:34:11.164 --> 01:34:12.358
As people?

01:34:14.867 --> 01:34:18.303
You know, we blame our parents
for everything these days.

01:34:19.872 --> 01:34:22.397
You've gotta remember
they had parents, too.

01:34:22.509 --> 01:34:23.602
I suppose.

01:34:27.282 --> 01:34:29.250
You had a mama and a papa, too?

01:34:29.484 --> 01:34:31.418
Oh, yes, most assuredly.

01:34:34.222 --> 01:34:36.588
That'll be all, Deanie. You can go now.

01:34:40.328 --> 01:34:41.886
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:34:51.174 --> 01:34:53.404
Have you heard from that young man?

01:34:53.877 --> 01:34:55.208
What was his name?

01:34:55.646 --> 01:34:56.476
Bud?

01:35:00.784 --> 01:35:01.751
No.

01:35:03.820 --> 01:35:06.345
No, we've given up writing.

01:35:07.057 --> 01:35:09.548
I guess he's probably away at school.

01:35:11.395 --> 01:35:15.060
I don't know. No one ever writes me
anything about him.

01:35:18.704 --> 01:35:20.797
I guess they're afraid it would upset me.

01:35:21.674 --> 01:35:22.641
Would it?

01:35:29.982 --> 01:35:32.712
Maybe you'll feel a little stronger
about it in time.

01:35:34.286 --> 01:35:35.412
I hope so.

01:35:55.609 --> 01:35:58.407
I'll bet they've been practicing
some of that Freud on her.

01:35:58.512 --> 01:36:02.141
I've read about him.
All he's concerned about is sex.

01:36:02.283 --> 01:36:05.880
And it's costing us every blessed penny
we made on our stocks.

01:36:06.122 --> 01:36:09.216
If we could've held onto those stocks,
we would've made a fortune.

01:36:09.325 --> 01:36:13.659
I don't think it's very polite of you to turn
on the radio when I'm talking to you.

01:36:13.763 --> 01:36:15.526
Stock prices crashed today...

01:36:15.631 --> 01:36:19.226
...in the most disastrous trading ever
on the New York Stock Exchange.

01:36:19.335 --> 01:36:22.668
$14 billion was lost
in the nation-wide attempt to unload.

01:36:23.206 --> 01:36:27.233
Sell out? What do you mean, sell out?
You're getting panicky like everybody else.

01:36:27.343 --> 01:36:29.245
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

01:36:29.681 --> 01:36:33.549
Now just don't get panicky, Jack.
Don't lose your courage.

01:36:34.486 --> 01:36:35.544
Come in.

01:36:35.653 --> 01:36:38.918
Hang on, Jack, just hang on.
Just hang in there.

01:36:40.024 --> 01:36:42.492
No, I can't go on with this right now, Jack.

01:36:42.594 --> 01:36:45.222
Sit down, friend, I'll be right with you.

01:36:45.630 --> 01:36:46.995
I'm in New Haven.

01:36:47.832 --> 01:36:49.493
My kid's in school up here.

01:36:50.435 --> 01:36:54.874
Oh, hell, he's doing just fine.
Flunking every course, but otherwise fine.

01:36:55.976 --> 01:36:59.639
He'll be all right.
I got an idea what's wrong with him.

01:37:01.248 --> 01:37:03.045
Yeah, I'll be calling you.

01:37:05.619 --> 01:37:07.917
- What'd you find out?
- You were right.

01:37:08.021 --> 01:37:09.784
- Who is she?
- She's a waitress.

01:37:09.890 --> 01:37:10.982
Waitress?

01:37:11.091 --> 01:37:13.423
In a pizza place. It's all right here.

01:37:15.295 --> 01:37:16.728
Do you want a drink?

01:37:18.767 --> 01:37:19.825
Bud, suppose you tell us-

01:37:19.935 --> 01:37:22.301
He hasn't been applying himself.
I know my boy.

01:37:22.404 --> 01:37:26.306
He could pass any course you offer here.
Flying colors, straight A's.

01:37:26.408 --> 01:37:27.466
Thank you.

01:37:27.743 --> 01:37:30.712
Suppose you tell us
what you think is the matter, Bud.

01:37:38.420 --> 01:37:42.049
Have you really been interested
in your work here at Yale?

01:37:42.893 --> 01:37:46.624
What difference does that make?
I sent you here to graduate.

01:37:47.364 --> 01:37:50.094
I'm sorry to disappoint you, Dad, but-

01:37:50.201 --> 01:37:52.829
Now why don't we just talk turkey, Son?

01:37:53.070 --> 01:37:57.063
Tell us what's been on your mind.
What's been eating your time and energy?

01:37:57.174 --> 01:37:59.768
A long-distance call from New York
for Mr. Stamper.

01:37:59.877 --> 01:38:03.108
- Where can I take it?
- Urgent. Right this way, sir.

01:38:11.390 --> 01:38:14.826
Is there anything you'd rather
be doing now than going to school here?

01:38:15.728 --> 01:38:20.665
To tell you the truth, Dean Pollard,
I never wanted to do a thing but ranch.

01:38:21.300 --> 01:38:22.267
But, Dad...

01:38:22.368 --> 01:38:25.599
I've never had the belief
that everybody should go to college.

01:38:26.639 --> 01:38:28.470
Well, maybe you could talk to him.

01:38:29.675 --> 01:38:32.703
He isn't a very good listener really, is he?

01:38:40.722 --> 01:38:42.485
I gotta get back to New York right away.

01:38:42.590 --> 01:38:45.457
Bud, suppose you let me talk
to your father.

01:38:46.027 --> 01:38:47.927
Yeah, sure. Thank you.

01:38:49.797 --> 01:38:52.231
I'll see you back in your room, Son.

01:38:53.468 --> 01:38:56.335
Dean Pollard, what's the matter
with people?

01:38:56.471 --> 01:38:58.031
What do you mean?

01:39:00.443 --> 01:39:03.344
The whole town of New York
is jumping out of windows.

01:39:04.047 --> 01:39:05.674
I mean, they're quitting.

01:39:05.782 --> 01:39:09.218
And things are gonna get back to normal
in a couple of days.

01:39:09.319 --> 01:39:11.514
- You really think so?
- I know so! I know so!

01:39:11.621 --> 01:39:13.555
They've got to! They've got to!

01:39:14.925 --> 01:39:16.517
Now, about the boy...

01:39:17.260 --> 01:39:21.162
I'm gonna take him to New York with me.

01:39:21.798 --> 01:39:26.499
I'll have him back here Monday morning
ready to settle down and go to work.

01:39:27.072 --> 01:39:32.237
I must say, Mr. Stamper, I do not feel
that the boy should remain in school here.

01:39:32.744 --> 01:39:35.042
Please don't give up on him.

01:39:35.480 --> 01:39:38.142
Don't give up on him, Dean Pollard.

01:39:40.385 --> 01:39:43.821
I had to go through something like this
with him once before.

01:39:44.489 --> 01:39:48.689
He falls for some little girl
and then that's all he can think about.

01:39:48.796 --> 01:39:53.290
- I don't think that's it, Mr. Stamper.
- I think that's it! I think that's it!

01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:58.133
I think I've known him a little bit longer
and a little bit better than you have!

01:39:58.238 --> 01:40:01.469
I had to break something like this before!
I'll break it up again!

01:40:01.575 --> 01:40:04.601
I'll have him Monday morning
ready to go to work!

01:40:16.092 --> 01:40:17.457
Kewpie dolls.

01:40:18.361 --> 01:40:19.555
Kewpie dolls.

01:40:20.229 --> 01:40:22.561
Would you like a Kewpie doll
for your cutie-pie?

01:40:22.665 --> 01:40:24.724
- Yeah. How much are they?
- $50.

01:40:24.834 --> 01:40:28.861
All right, you fish $50 out of there
and you give me the rest back.

01:40:32.942 --> 01:40:33.909
Thank you.

01:40:34.210 --> 01:40:35.177
Thank you.

01:40:36.412 --> 01:40:37.344
'Bye.

01:40:37.481 --> 01:40:38.414
'Bye.

01:40:50.061 --> 01:40:52.427
They all look the same in this town.

01:40:56.200 --> 01:40:59.465
The newlyweds. Stand up.
Give the little girl a hand.

01:41:10.950 --> 01:41:12.383
Hello, suckers.

01:41:15.688 --> 01:41:18.054
I think I smell fresh money tonight.

01:41:18.491 --> 01:41:23.224
I'm glad the stock market crash
didn't keep you from coming out tonight.

01:41:24.798 --> 01:41:29.100
Tonight as I was walking
down Park Avenue to get a taxi...

01:41:30.005 --> 01:41:33.771
...I had to dodge the bodies
jumping out of the windows.

01:41:35.177 --> 01:41:37.077
But let's not be morbid.

01:41:41.817 --> 01:41:43.876
- Same all around?
- No, no more for me.

01:41:43.985 --> 01:41:45.316
Same all around.

01:41:50.826 --> 01:41:52.762
Lay one on me. Lay one on.

01:41:53.397 --> 01:41:54.455
Doggone.

01:41:55.199 --> 01:41:56.166
Dad, let's go.

01:41:56.266 --> 01:41:58.063
Wait, Bud, wait a minute.

01:41:58.168 --> 01:42:00.068
The point I'm trying to make, Bud...

01:42:00.170 --> 01:42:04.334
I never have been able to make
this one point with you, Son.

01:42:10.514 --> 01:42:11.947
Bud, listen...

01:42:13.517 --> 01:42:17.112
I may not be around
too much longer and...

01:42:18.357 --> 01:42:19.824
What are you talking about?

01:42:19.925 --> 01:42:23.861
Wait now. Don't act so worried.
I got no intention of kicking off for a while.

01:42:23.963 --> 01:42:25.794
What are you leading up to?

01:42:31.604 --> 01:42:35.597
It may be that I haven't always done
the right thing by you, boy...

01:42:35.708 --> 01:42:37.005
...and I'm sorry.

01:42:37.176 --> 01:42:40.441
There may be things
I might have taken away.

01:42:42.917 --> 01:42:45.044
I'd like to make it up to you.

01:42:53.394 --> 01:42:54.656
Forget it, Dad.

01:43:13.583 --> 01:43:16.575
Look up there.
Look up there on that stage.

01:43:17.353 --> 01:43:18.377
Deanie.

01:43:22.559 --> 01:43:24.891
Yeah, she does look a little like Deanie.

01:43:24.994 --> 01:43:28.987
Little, hell! Hell, a little! Exactly!
Same damn thing! Exactly!

01:43:29.299 --> 01:43:32.565
Same damn thing! Just as pretty!
Just as pretty!

01:43:32.804 --> 01:43:36.240
You never been fair to me on that.
I did that for your own good.

01:43:36.341 --> 01:43:39.708
How'd you like to be married to her now?
Did you ever think about that?

01:43:39.811 --> 01:43:43.872
Ever think of how you'd like to be married
to Deanie with her in that institute?

01:43:43.982 --> 01:43:46.382
Did you ever think about it?
How'd you like that?

01:43:46.484 --> 01:43:49.248
How'd you like that?
Her in that institution?

01:43:50.822 --> 01:43:53.313
What the hell difference does it make?

01:43:53.425 --> 01:43:56.292
That's the same thing!
That's the same thing exactly!

01:43:56.394 --> 01:44:00.457
And just as pretty! Just as pretty!
You look up there, just as pretty!

01:44:00.567 --> 01:44:04.367
You want that? Do you want it, Son?
Son, you want it, you can have it!

01:44:04.471 --> 01:44:08.202
You can have it, boy. I'll get it for you.
You can have anything you want.

01:44:08.308 --> 01:44:11.334
Anything you want, boy!
This world is your oyster!

01:44:11.445 --> 01:44:14.312
You sit here, I'll show you.
You sit there, I'll show you.

01:44:14.414 --> 01:44:15.938
You sit there, I'll show you.

01:44:53.357 --> 01:44:54.381
Yeah?

01:45:03.267 --> 01:45:04.393
Are you Bud?

01:45:06.003 --> 01:45:07.197
Yes, ma'am.

01:45:07.305 --> 01:45:09.273
Aren't you gonna invite me in?

01:45:17.750 --> 01:45:19.149
I'm sorry, but...

01:45:20.219 --> 01:45:22.687
...I think you must've got the wrong room.

01:45:59.194 --> 01:46:00.320
Mr. Stamper?

01:46:06.370 --> 01:46:07.667
Mr. Stamper!

01:46:35.701 --> 01:46:36.861
That's him.

01:46:37.002 --> 01:46:38.970
What do you want to do with...?

01:46:41.373 --> 01:46:42.806
I'll take him home.

01:47:05.197 --> 01:47:06.994
I'll be home in a few hours.

01:47:08.067 --> 01:47:09.364
The first time in...

01:47:09.468 --> 01:47:11.868
Two years and six months
almost to the day.

01:47:11.971 --> 01:47:13.700
How do you feel about going home?

01:47:14.506 --> 01:47:16.804
Like going to a foreign country.

01:47:27.355 --> 01:47:28.982
John has asked me to marry him.

01:47:30.191 --> 01:47:31.886
You waited until now to tell me?

01:47:33.894 --> 01:47:34.826
Well.

01:47:35.263 --> 01:47:37.197
Are you going to accept?

01:47:37.565 --> 01:47:38.930
I don't know.

01:47:39.367 --> 01:47:40.925
Do you love John?

01:47:43.172 --> 01:47:44.469
I think so.

01:47:47.910 --> 01:47:50.435
It's different from the way
that I felt about...

01:47:51.848 --> 01:47:52.815
...Bud.

01:47:55.685 --> 01:47:56.743
But, I...

01:47:59.188 --> 01:48:00.416
...I love him.

01:48:00.690 --> 01:48:05.024
Well, I see no reason why both of you
shouldn't have a very happy future.

01:48:05.361 --> 01:48:09.925
John's back in Cincinnati now,
practicing medicine, doing very well.

01:48:10.669 --> 01:48:11.795
I know.

01:48:12.370 --> 01:48:14.463
I hear from him every day.

01:48:19.544 --> 01:48:20.772
My taxi.

01:48:26.184 --> 01:48:27.481
Taxi's here.

01:48:30.722 --> 01:48:32.851
Will you see Bud when you're home?

01:48:33.627 --> 01:48:34.889
I don't know.

01:48:35.162 --> 01:48:37.596
Do you think you'll be happy
married to John if...

01:48:37.698 --> 01:48:41.429
...you still don't know how you feel
about the other young man?

01:48:43.170 --> 01:48:46.697
When we face these fears
they sometimes turn into nothing.

01:49:00.923 --> 01:49:02.447
All right, Dr. Judd.

01:49:04.093 --> 01:49:05.390
I'll see him.

01:49:09.598 --> 01:49:10.963
I'll write to you.

01:49:25.015 --> 01:49:25.982
Bye-bye.

01:49:48.441 --> 01:49:50.602
Why couldn't you marry a boy from here?

01:49:50.710 --> 01:49:54.510
You won't be much company for me,
living back East in Cincinnati.

01:49:54.614 --> 01:49:57.208
What do you know about
this young man you're marrying?

01:49:57.316 --> 01:50:00.877
After all, you met him in a mental hospital.
Are you sure he's all right?

01:50:00.987 --> 01:50:02.420
I was in the hospital, too.

01:50:02.522 --> 01:50:05.548
Well, with you it was different.
You were just run down.

01:50:05.658 --> 01:50:08.388
That was the only thing
the matter with you.

01:50:10.096 --> 01:50:11.757
Is he a New Dealer?

01:50:11.998 --> 01:50:13.194
I don't know.

01:50:13.835 --> 01:50:18.863
I could cry, just cry, when I think
I'm going to lose my little girl.

01:50:20.074 --> 01:50:21.974
How much did this cost?

01:50:22.444 --> 01:50:23.934
I don't know, Mother.

01:50:34.422 --> 01:50:36.515
Did those doctors at the hospital...

01:50:36.624 --> 01:50:39.857
...say your mother had raised you wrong
or something?

01:50:41.465 --> 01:50:43.899
Did they blame your father...

01:50:46.136 --> 01:50:47.967
...and me in any way?

01:50:53.143 --> 01:50:55.134
I don't blame anyone, Mother.

01:50:56.079 --> 01:50:59.845
I raised you the only way I knew how.
The only way I knew how.

01:51:00.550 --> 01:51:02.245
The way my mother raised me...

01:51:03.055 --> 01:51:05.888
...and I suppose the way
her mother raised her.

01:51:07.392 --> 01:51:11.624
If I brought you up wrong, Deanie,
I don't think you should hate me.

01:51:13.765 --> 01:51:16.393
I know I used to hate my mother at times...

01:51:17.803 --> 01:51:21.967
...but I always believed she was right
about things. Maybe she wasn't...

01:51:23.876 --> 01:51:25.309
...but I loved her.

01:51:31.185 --> 01:51:32.846
I love you, Mother.

01:51:39.994 --> 01:51:41.621
I hope so, Deanie.

01:51:52.239 --> 01:51:56.143
You know it would be nice if children
could be born into this world...

01:51:56.245 --> 01:52:01.239
...with an absolute guarantee they'd have
just the right kind of bringing up...

01:52:01.384 --> 01:52:03.978
...and all lead happy, normal lives, but...

01:52:05.521 --> 01:52:09.890
Well, I guess when we get born
we just all have to take our chances.

01:52:12.328 --> 01:52:13.226
Mom?

01:52:15.364 --> 01:52:16.763
Is he married?

01:52:16.933 --> 01:52:17.902
Who?

01:52:20.538 --> 01:52:24.497
To tell you the truth, Deanie,
I don't really know.

01:52:25.076 --> 01:52:28.978
Don't be afraid of running into him.
Maybe he's living with his mother in Tulsa.

01:52:29.080 --> 01:52:32.106
She joined her folks there
after old Ace killed himself.

01:52:32.216 --> 01:52:35.743
They say she's as poor as a church mouse.
And that girl Ginny?

01:52:36.120 --> 01:52:37.883
Got killed in a car accident.

01:52:37.989 --> 01:52:41.982
We all knew something like that
would happen the way she carried on.

01:52:43.630 --> 01:52:47.396
Now the Stampers are almost extinct
in this town.

01:52:49.836 --> 01:52:52.703
You know their home's been turned
into a funeral parlor?

01:52:54.774 --> 01:52:57.174
Some of the old gang's here
to see you, Deanie.

01:52:57.277 --> 01:53:00.110
- I can't wait to see her.
- It seems simply ages.

01:53:01.348 --> 01:53:02.940
How is she, Mr. Loomis?

01:53:05.585 --> 01:53:06.847
She's fine.

01:53:29.645 --> 01:53:31.670
Come on, come for a ride with us.

01:53:32.080 --> 01:53:35.051
All right, but give me two minutes
to wash the train off.

01:53:42.459 --> 01:53:43.926
Just one thing:

01:53:45.129 --> 01:53:47.427
Keep her away from Bud Stamper.

01:53:47.998 --> 01:53:50.330
Mrs. Loomis, she's forgotten about all that.

01:53:50.434 --> 01:53:52.868
No, she hasn't. Have some fudge.

01:53:53.303 --> 01:53:55.828
The very first thing she did
was ask about him.

01:53:55.939 --> 01:53:59.604
And then she laid on the bed
and cried and cried.

01:54:00.513 --> 01:54:03.607
I thought that the years away
she'd forget about him but...

01:54:09.722 --> 01:54:12.213
Now I want you to promise me.

01:54:12.358 --> 01:54:17.295
The doctors say she's perfectly all right,
but there's no use in asking for trouble.

01:54:18.698 --> 01:54:20.256
Keep her away from him.

01:54:25.973 --> 01:54:29.374
Well, here's our girl.

01:54:37.185 --> 01:54:38.777
I want to see Bud now.

01:54:39.821 --> 01:54:41.789
Now, honey, you just forget about him.

01:54:41.889 --> 01:54:44.585
I'm not even sure where he is now, Deanie.

01:54:44.759 --> 01:54:48.322
I mean, no one ever sees him.
Do you know where he is, Hazel?

01:54:49.332 --> 01:54:51.459
He's staying out at his father's old ranch.

01:55:22.834 --> 01:55:25.997
- It's a long way out there.
- I want to go, please.

01:55:37.315 --> 01:55:38.875
Clear out of there!

01:55:42.823 --> 01:55:45.018
You want me to go looking for Bud?

01:55:45.359 --> 01:55:46.849
Oh, Hazel, would you?

01:56:03.879 --> 01:56:05.312
He's around back.

01:56:19.061 --> 01:56:20.028
I know.

01:56:27.738 --> 01:56:30.002
Hi, Bud. Jeepers, you're a mess.

01:56:30.107 --> 01:56:32.803
Yeah, I've been working.
We have 40 head of cattle now.

01:56:34.111 --> 01:56:36.636
Bud, Deanie's out there in the car.

01:56:44.522 --> 01:56:47.923
- I hate to see Deanie when I'm so dirty.
- She won't mind, Bud.

01:56:55.501 --> 01:56:56.593
How is she?

01:56:57.203 --> 01:56:58.670
She seems just fine.

01:57:00.807 --> 01:57:02.274
Well, I'm glad.

01:57:08.414 --> 01:57:09.403
Hi, Bud.

01:57:28.870 --> 01:57:30.167
Long time no see.

01:57:31.506 --> 01:57:32.700
Long time.

01:57:33.441 --> 01:57:34.965
It's good to see you.

01:57:36.077 --> 01:57:37.169
Thanks, Bud.

01:57:48.625 --> 01:57:50.058
You want to meet my family?

01:57:54.765 --> 01:57:55.959
Of course.

01:58:00.337 --> 01:58:01.304
Come on.

01:58:02.839 --> 01:58:04.534
She didn't even know he was married.

01:58:04.641 --> 01:58:06.768
You're her best friend.
Why didn't you tell her?

01:58:06.877 --> 01:58:08.039
I just couldn't.

01:58:18.524 --> 01:58:21.084
Come here, honey,
I want you to meet somebody.

01:58:23.762 --> 01:58:24.751
Hello.

01:58:25.130 --> 01:58:28.122
Angelina, this is Deanie,
an old friend of mine.

01:58:30.269 --> 01:58:31.463
How do you do?

01:58:36.043 --> 01:58:37.738
How do you do, Angelina?

01:58:38.713 --> 01:58:40.078
Would you like to come in?

01:58:40.614 --> 01:58:41.638
Please.

01:58:44.251 --> 01:58:45.218
Come in.

01:58:49.790 --> 01:58:50.757
Hungry?

01:58:51.892 --> 01:58:55.157
The house, it doesn't look like much.

01:58:55.663 --> 01:58:59.465
- Maybe I can offer you some wine.
- Thank you, but I really can't stay.

01:59:01.170 --> 01:59:02.569
This is Bud Junior.

01:59:03.673 --> 01:59:05.504
The one without the feathers.

01:59:10.313 --> 01:59:11.280
Oh, sure.

01:59:15.785 --> 01:59:18.219
Hello, Bud Junior. Hello.

01:59:18.988 --> 01:59:21.252
What a fine boy you are!

01:59:31.436 --> 01:59:35.236
So now we're expecting another child.
I hope it's a girl this time.

01:59:36.875 --> 01:59:38.365
You're a fine boy.

01:59:46.184 --> 01:59:47.778
Well, I have to go now.

01:59:49.356 --> 01:59:53.292
You will come back again sometime?
Will you come back for dinner?

01:59:53.393 --> 01:59:54.860
Thank you, Angelina.

02:00:19.054 --> 02:00:22.023
I married Angie when I left New Haven.

02:00:24.159 --> 02:00:26.923
You know I didn't even finish
my first year there?

02:00:27.029 --> 02:00:28.519
She's real nice.

02:00:29.231 --> 02:00:32.462
She was wonderful to me
when things started to go wrong.

02:00:33.001 --> 02:00:34.628
You're happy, Bud?

02:00:38.776 --> 02:00:39.868
I guess so.

02:00:41.745 --> 02:00:44.646
I don't ask myself that question
very often now.

02:00:47.184 --> 02:00:48.412
How about you?

02:00:50.454 --> 02:00:52.319
I'm getting married next month.

02:00:52.423 --> 02:00:53.754
Are you, Deanie?

02:00:55.659 --> 02:00:57.286
A boy from Cincinnati.

02:01:00.331 --> 02:01:02.094
I think you might like him.

02:01:09.542 --> 02:01:12.534
Things work out awful funny sometimes,
don't they?

02:01:13.179 --> 02:01:14.510
Yes, they do.

02:01:19.485 --> 02:01:21.680
Hope you're gonna be awful happy.

02:01:22.522 --> 02:01:26.515
Like you, Bud, I don't think too much
about happiness either.

02:01:29.697 --> 02:01:32.689
What's the point?
You gotta take what comes.

02:01:34.736 --> 02:01:35.760
Yes.

02:02:00.664 --> 02:02:02.723
I'm awful glad to see you again.

02:02:06.536 --> 02:02:07.764
Thanks, Bud.

02:02:09.172 --> 02:02:10.230
Goodbye.

02:02:12.509 --> 02:02:13.476
'Bye.

02:02:16.246 --> 02:02:17.304
So long, Bud.

02:02:17.682 --> 02:02:18.672
Hello.

02:02:19.318 --> 02:02:22.344
- You girls have to come again sometime.
- You might ask us.

02:02:22.454 --> 02:02:26.185
I will. I promise. Angie and I got
a little more money coming in now.

02:02:26.291 --> 02:02:28.486
We'll have a big beer party. She'll call you.

02:02:28.594 --> 02:02:29.754
- It's a date.
- Great.

02:02:32.364 --> 02:02:33.456
Goodbye.

02:02:56.757 --> 02:02:58.224
When do we eat?

02:03:10.740 --> 02:03:13.641
Deanie, honey, do you think
you still love him?

02:03:21.784 --> 02:03:26.380
"Though nothing can bring back the hour
Of splendor in the grass...

02:03:28.157 --> 02:03:29.886
"... of glory in the flower;

02:03:30.693 --> 02:03:36.656
"We will grieve not, rather find
Strength in what remains behind... "
