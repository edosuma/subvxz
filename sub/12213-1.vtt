-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

00:16.808 --> 00:17.808
I sing.

00:17.935 --> 00:19.482
Why do you sing?

00:19.770 --> 00:23.775
Well, because,
um, I get to experience

00:24.066 --> 00:25.066
a lot of feelings.

00:25.234 --> 00:26.234
It's really a lot of fun.

00:26.443 --> 00:27.865
You get to feel
all kinds of things

00:28.153 --> 00:31.123
that you could hardly find if
you went to parties all year

00:31.406 --> 00:33.784
round and made it with
everyone you ever wanted to

00:34.076 --> 00:36.387
because you get to feel things
that are in your imagination

00:36.411 --> 00:37.537
and another end of truth.

00:37.829 --> 00:41.379
That's why I like music
because it's created from

00:41.667 --> 00:44.841
and as it's happening
creates feelings.

00:45.128 --> 00:46.128
What could I feel if I

00:46.380 --> 00:47.677
attended your concert tonight?

00:47.965 --> 00:50.138
I'd like you
to feel like standing up

00:50.425 --> 00:52.105
and jump up and down
in time with the music

00:52.219 --> 00:55.189
and get sweaty and
just go with the music.

00:55.472 --> 00:56.472
Just go with it.

00:56.723 --> 00:58.123
Like, rock and
roll's very rhythmic.

00:58.308 --> 00:58.934
That's what it's all about.

00:59.226 --> 01:01.729
You know, it's 1,2, 3, 4.

01:02.020 --> 01:03.863
Yeah, you thought you had

01:04.147 --> 01:07.242
found yourself a good
girl, one who would love

01:07.526 --> 01:08.903
you and give you the world.

01:09.194 --> 01:11.788
Then you find, hun, that
you've been misused.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.289
Look at me, honey.

01:13.574 --> 01:14.666
I'll do what you choose.

01:14.950 --> 01:18.204
I want you to, well,
tell Mama all about it.

01:18.495 --> 01:19.587
Yeah, tell Mama.

01:19.871 --> 01:21.088
What do you need?

01:21.373 --> 01:23.125
Tell your Mama, babe.

01:23.417 --> 01:24.134
What you want?

01:24.418 --> 01:25.590
Tell your Mama, babe.

01:25.877 --> 01:26.877
What do you need?

01:27.045 --> 01:28.217
What do you want?

01:28.505 --> 01:29.677
What do you need?

01:29.965 --> 01:32.093
What do you want?

01:32.384 --> 01:35.012
I'll make everything all right.

01:35.304 --> 01:37.398
I'll tell ya.

01:37.681 --> 01:41.811
When you get lonely... and I
figure everybody does, now,

01:42.102 --> 01:44.946
because as a matter of
fact, everybody does... I'll

01:45.230 --> 01:46.652
tell you what you need, baby.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.751
When you get those strange
thoughts in your head,

01:48.775 --> 01:50.175
you don't know where
they came from,

01:50.235 --> 01:52.035
man, you've got those
strange little weirdness

01:52.112 --> 01:53.112
that's happening to you.

01:53.155 --> 01:54.372
You don't know what they are.

01:54.656 --> 01:56.750
I'll tell you what you need.

01:57.034 --> 01:59.503
You need a sweet-loving
mama, baby.

01:59.786 --> 02:02.414
Hun, a sweet-talking
mama, babe, you

02:02.706 --> 02:05.550
know, someone to listen to you,
someone to want you, someone

02:05.834 --> 02:09.714
to hold you, someone to need
you, someone to use you,

02:10.005 --> 02:13.225
someone to want you, someone
that needs you, someone

02:13.508 --> 02:14.851
to hold you.

02:15.135 --> 02:19.686
You need a mama, mama, mama,
babe, a mama, ma, ma, ma.

02:19.973 --> 02:23.147
Yeah, mama, mama, mama, ma mama.

02:23.435 --> 02:25.654
Tell Mama all about it.

02:25.937 --> 02:28.656
Tell Mama all about it.

02:28.940 --> 02:30.157
What do you need?

02:30.442 --> 02:31.614
What do you want?

02:31.902 --> 02:37.580
Anything I can do,
anything I can do,

02:37.866 --> 02:41.086
I'll be your mama, babe,
yeah, your mama, babe,

02:41.370 --> 02:47.468
<i>oh, mama, babe, oh, mama, babe,
oh, mama, babe, oh, mama, babe.</i>

02:47.751 --> 02:48.991
I'll make everything all right.

03:13.568 --> 03:15.570
Dear family, I managed

03:15.862 --> 03:21.414
to pass my 27th birthday
without really feeling it.

03:21.702 --> 03:22.782
Oh, it's such a funny game.

03:25.497 --> 03:28.376
Two years ago, I didn't
even want to be it.

03:28.667 --> 03:30.010
No, that's not true.

03:30.293 --> 03:32.546
I've been looking around,
and I've noticed something.

03:32.838 --> 03:35.808
After you reach a certain level
of talent... and quite a few

03:36.091 --> 03:38.185
have that talent...
The deciding factor

03:38.468 --> 03:42.564
is ambition or, as I see it,
how much you really need,

03:42.848 --> 03:47.695
need to be loved and need
to be proud of yourself.

03:47.978 --> 03:50.026
And I guess that's
what ambition is.

03:50.313 --> 03:53.658
It's not all a depraved
quest for position or money.

03:53.942 --> 03:58.493
Maybe it's for love,
lots of love, ha, Janice.

04:10.125 --> 04:12.048
Port Arthur, to a lot of people,

04:12.335 --> 04:15.384
it was a really good
town to grow up in.

04:15.672 --> 04:17.094
I never thought so.

04:17.382 --> 04:21.228
Janice never thought
so, and she couldn't

04:21.511 --> 04:27.314
figure out how to make
herself like everybody else,

04:27.601 --> 04:28.601
thank goodness.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.198
Our parents,
I'm not exactly sure

04:37.486 --> 04:39.363
how they actually
met, but they started

04:39.654 --> 04:42.999
dating after Mother had gone
away to college and come back

04:43.283 --> 04:45.331
and started working.

04:45.619 --> 04:48.748
Daddy was a mechanical
engineer, but he

04:49.039 --> 04:51.212
was able to get a job
because at that time,

04:51.500 --> 04:54.595
so many people
were away fighting.

04:54.878 --> 04:56.438
So he got a job at
Texaco, and he stayed

04:56.630 --> 04:58.177
there his entire working life.

04:58.465 --> 05:02.186
And he came home from work
one day and told mother,

05:02.469 --> 05:06.190
let's do something
for posterity.

05:06.473 --> 05:14.473
So that's Janis
being born in 1943.

05:16.525 --> 05:23.534
So that's Janis
being born in 1943.

05:23.824 --> 05:26.703
She joined the choir,

05:26.993 --> 05:31.339
and they kicked her
out of the choir.

05:31.623 --> 05:35.469
She wouldn't follow directions,
and they said, you're out.

05:44.761 --> 05:46.388
Like most women, Janis

05:46.680 --> 05:49.479
wanted to be beautiful
and curvaceous and skinny

05:49.766 --> 05:53.646
like the pictures that
she saw in magazines.

05:53.937 --> 05:59.285
And she saw herself, you know,
gain weight and get chunky.

05:59.568 --> 06:01.787
Her skin broke out,
and her features

06:02.070 --> 06:05.165
weren't that fine, beautiful,
female thing that we

06:05.448 --> 06:06.495
see pictures everywhere.

06:10.453 --> 06:12.672
And so she had
questions about her own,

06:12.956 --> 06:13.956
you know, desirability.

06:27.470 --> 06:29.768
She demanded to be different.

06:30.056 --> 06:32.400
You know, our parents had
given us permission to do it

06:32.684 --> 06:37.110
and then weren't aware of what
would happen if you did it.

06:37.397 --> 06:42.449
Janis was the first one in
our family to find that out,

06:42.736 --> 06:46.616
that if you were rocking the
boat, you might get noticed.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.955
And she rocked the boat
as often as she could.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.322
She liked rocking the boat.

06:53.872 --> 06:55.215
The world was changing,

06:55.498 --> 06:58.843
and I think that Janis's
interpretation of what being

06:59.127 --> 07:03.633
good was included things that
a lot of people in the South

07:03.924 --> 07:05.676
weren't yet ready to include.

07:05.967 --> 07:09.392
She said, I think immigration
is the right thing to do.

07:09.679 --> 07:13.900
Well, our hometown had
an active KKK chapter.

07:14.184 --> 07:17.233
And what happened
was she was harassed

07:17.520 --> 07:19.568
by some guys in her class.

07:19.856 --> 07:20.982
They threw pennies at her.

07:21.274 --> 07:25.745
They called her names,
and she became a target

07:26.029 --> 07:27.656
for the last three
years of high school.

07:33.995 --> 07:36.999
She started dressing
differently, wearing loafers

07:37.290 --> 07:39.167
without socks and tight skirts.

07:39.459 --> 07:43.305
Her hair was becoming
more, like, beatnik,

07:43.588 --> 07:46.967
and still there was an
aspect of her sexuality

07:47.258 --> 07:49.727
and her personality
that was at odds.

07:50.011 --> 07:50.637
Where does she go?

07:50.929 --> 07:51.929
What does she do?

07:54.599 --> 07:56.818
She was pushing the
limits, and women

07:57.102 --> 07:58.399
weren't supposed to swear.

07:58.687 --> 08:00.485
And women were
supposed to be demure

08:00.772 --> 08:05.323
and not know that anything
existed below their waistlines.

08:05.610 --> 08:09.660
And I met her in high school,
and she wouldn't go away.

08:09.948 --> 08:13.168
She was always calling us
up, one of us or the other,

08:13.451 --> 08:15.124
and say, what are
you doing tonight'?

08:15.412 --> 08:16.412
Where are we going?

08:19.165 --> 08:20.587
She was a lot of trouble.

08:20.875 --> 08:25.426
We went to Louisiana, and
she would start fights which

08:25.714 --> 08:28.092
we didn't want started
because the Cajuns

08:28.383 --> 08:29.976
were known, good fighters.

08:30.260 --> 08:33.389
But she got a kick out of it,
just playing the bad girl.

08:33.679 --> 08:34.977
She wasn't a bad girl.

08:35.265 --> 08:38.360
I mean, she just
liked to bait the men.

08:38.643 --> 08:43.149
You know, we would deny
all knowledge of her

08:43.440 --> 08:45.818
and barely escape
with our lives.

08:46.109 --> 08:48.362
That made her real
dangerous to take to a bar.

08:56.870 --> 09:00.500
I mean, she was amusing, so we
took her to the beach with us.

09:00.790 --> 09:04.340
She borrowed some records
which were obscure.

09:04.627 --> 09:06.880
One of them was a
record by Odetta.

09:12.844 --> 09:16.815
All of a sudden, she busted into
a perfect imitation of Odetta

09:17.098 --> 09:19.977
on the record, and
everybody was just

09:20.268 --> 09:25.991
stunned... this little,
troublesome kid, you know,

09:26.274 --> 09:29.244
could sing that well.

09:59.599 --> 10:02.273
This particular
night Janis said,

10:02.560 --> 10:04.938
let's go see this
wonderful Austin

10:05.230 --> 10:08.154
you're always talking about.

10:08.441 --> 10:12.662
So we pulled in at
five thirty in the morning,

10:12.946 --> 10:16.496
and you could hear music.

10:16.783 --> 10:18.160
And it wasn't recorded music.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.124
It was live music.

10:20.411 --> 10:22.209
And Janis grabbed my
arm, and she said,

10:22.497 --> 10:24.420
Jack, I am going
to like it here.

10:34.008 --> 10:35.134
On accident, I discovered

10:35.426 --> 10:37.520
I had an incredibly loud voice.

10:37.804 --> 10:39.764
So I started singing blues
because that was always

10:39.973 --> 10:44.649
what I liked, and, you know,
I got in a bluegrass band,

10:44.936 --> 10:48.440
played hillbilly music in
Austin, Texas for free beer.

10:48.731 --> 10:51.234
I used to sing at folk
clubs just for a goof.

10:54.070 --> 10:56.539
We call ourselves
the Waller Creek Boys,

10:56.823 --> 11:02.080
and instantly Janis
became one of the boys.

11:07.083 --> 11:12.385
People just stared
open mouthed, and she

11:12.672 --> 11:15.266
was not ever accepted, really,
except by the folk community.

11:18.344 --> 11:23.271
Growing up, her peers picked
on her and bullied her.

11:23.558 --> 11:24.878
And by the time
she got to Austin,

11:25.101 --> 11:28.776
and by the time I knew
her, she had already been

11:29.063 --> 11:32.158
profoundly hurt over and over.

11:32.442 --> 11:34.285
And so in Austin,
it was the same way.

11:38.656 --> 11:43.127
Every year, the
fraternities held a contest,

11:43.411 --> 11:46.381
and people could nominate
someone to be ugliest man.

11:46.664 --> 11:53.513
And someone nominated Janis, and
all these jerks voted for her.

11:53.796 --> 12:00.600
And it crushed her,
saddest thing I ever saw.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.935
You know, it really was.

12:06.809 --> 12:10.313
To that point, I'd
never seen Janis cry.

12:10.605 --> 12:15.907
Janis had a very tough
exterior, but it really got her.

12:16.194 --> 12:18.617
It got her bad.

12:18.905 --> 12:22.079
And I said, Janis, they
don't mean anything to you.

12:22.367 --> 12:26.417
They're... they're not
even in your class.

12:26.704 --> 12:28.957
It became increasingly
harder to fit

12:29.249 --> 12:36.258
into a group of angry, angry
men who liked to pick on her.

12:36.547 --> 12:39.050
Even though she ran around with
a tight group of friends that

12:39.342 --> 12:42.516
were into books and
ideas, she needed

12:42.804 --> 12:44.124
to go out to where
the people were

12:44.389 --> 12:47.313
that wrote those books,
where the people were

12:47.600 --> 12:49.193
that sung those songs.

12:49.477 --> 12:50.194
Where does she go?

12:50.478 --> 12:51.478
What does she do?

13:04.742 --> 13:06.494
San Francisco.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.555
It would have to be about
'63 or something like that.

13:08.579 --> 13:12.209
I couldn't stand Texas anymore,
and I went to California

13:12.500 --> 13:13.752
because it's a lot freer.

13:14.043 --> 13:16.671
You can do what you want
to do, and nobody bugs you.

13:16.963 --> 13:20.684
15,000 San
Franciscans protest segregation

13:20.967 --> 13:23.345
in Birmingham, negro
and white citizens

13:23.636 --> 13:26.685
marching in unity for
equality in San Francisco.

13:29.642 --> 13:32.942
We used to all hang out at
a bar called the Anxious Asp

13:33.229 --> 13:34.469
on Green Street in North Beach.

13:37.442 --> 13:39.570
We went to a party one
night, and, you know,

13:39.861 --> 13:42.080
with a little of wine and
a little bit of, you know,

13:42.363 --> 13:44.661
whatever, We kind
of got to talking.

13:44.949 --> 13:47.828
And two weeks later,
she moved in with me.

13:51.539 --> 13:53.758
Sometimes, we went
down to Monterrey,

13:54.042 --> 13:55.760
and she would sing
in the hootenannies.

13:56.044 --> 13:59.844
And she would win tickets for
us to get to the main arena.

14:00.131 --> 14:04.682
One time, we went there, and
there was Bob Dylan, her idol.

14:04.969 --> 14:09.520
And she walks up to him, and she
said, oh, Bob, I just love you.

14:09.807 --> 14:11.287
You know, I'm gonna
be famous one day.

14:11.559 --> 14:14.062
He said, yeah, we're
all gonna be famous.

14:14.354 --> 14:15.981
I'll never forget
that, you know?

14:19.025 --> 14:21.869
She definitely felt the blues.

14:22.153 --> 14:24.576
Bessie Smith and all
the blues singers,

14:24.864 --> 14:26.662
she loved those people.

14:26.949 --> 14:30.249
And I think she emulated
them in the sense of wanting

14:30.536 --> 14:32.538
to be like them, you
know, to have the pain,

14:32.830 --> 14:34.430
and I guess that's
why she drank like she

14:34.707 --> 14:36.380
did and took drugs
because that's

14:36.667 --> 14:38.340
all part of the whole picture.

14:42.799 --> 14:46.349
She definitely needed people
to tell her how great she was,

14:46.636 --> 14:51.062
and she needed that
stroking all the time.

14:51.349 --> 14:53.943
I don't think she was with
girls to shock people.

14:54.227 --> 14:55.788
I think she was with
girls because that's

14:55.812 --> 14:58.281
what she felt at the moment.

14:58.564 --> 15:00.862
And I think she was
totally in a conflict

15:01.150 --> 15:03.869
all the time with
herself, constantly,

15:04.153 --> 15:07.123
and she was unhappy.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.125
She was quite
unhappy, and I think

15:09.409 --> 15:14.085
on the stage it made her feel
that she was somebody, that she

15:14.372 --> 15:15.840
had something to offer.

15:16.124 --> 15:18.843
And I said, I just think this
is not working for both of us.

15:19.127 --> 15:21.527
You know, you want to go off
and do things with other people,

15:21.796 --> 15:25.517
and I'm not strong
enough to handle that.

15:25.800 --> 15:28.349
She got with this
English fellow,

15:28.636 --> 15:30.809
and they were into shooting
up and stuff like that.

15:31.097 --> 15:32.474
And that was never my style.

15:32.765 --> 15:35.644
You know, I just never
could get into that.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.905
Janis was in North
Beach, and she

15:39.188 --> 15:40.906
developed an
intense relationship

15:41.190 --> 15:42.658
with Peter de Blanc.

15:42.942 --> 15:46.071
Then Janis got into methadrine.

15:46.362 --> 15:48.205
Janis told me that
they were living

15:48.489 --> 15:51.117
in that building
behind Tommy's joint

15:51.409 --> 15:53.628
and had not a
stick of furniture.

15:53.911 --> 15:55.959
And Peter was just sitting
there for hours on end

15:56.247 --> 15:58.407
throwing a Super Ball against
the wall and catching it.

16:01.043 --> 16:05.139
And she was skin and bones.

16:05.423 --> 16:09.223
She used, overused, lost weight,

16:09.510 --> 16:14.391
got so strung out that her
group of friends held a party,

16:14.682 --> 16:17.026
and they passed the
hat to get enough money

16:17.310 --> 16:20.234
to put her on a Greyhound
bus and send her back home.

16:31.574 --> 16:34.168
She and Peter decided
that they both needed

16:34.452 --> 16:37.581
to get their lives cleaned up
and would go to their hometowns

16:37.872 --> 16:39.433
and get their lives
together, and then they'd

16:39.457 --> 16:40.925
get together and get married.

16:51.427 --> 16:54.146
Dear Peter, well, I'm home now.

16:54.430 --> 16:57.149
I have your picture on the
desk where I do my homework,

16:57.433 --> 17:00.277
and everyone in the family's
seen it at least three times.

17:00.561 --> 17:02.939
Everyone agrees you're handsome.

17:03.231 --> 17:05.233
I really love you.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.325
In attempting to find a
semblance of a pattern

17:07.527 --> 17:11.452
in my life, I find I've gone
out with great vigor every time

17:11.739 --> 17:14.117
and gotten really fucked up.

17:14.407 --> 17:17.287
All I did was be wild,
drank constantly,

17:17.578 --> 17:19.454
fucked people, sang.

17:19.747 --> 17:21.920
Then San Francisco, kind
of wanting to find an old

17:22.208 --> 17:23.960
man and be happy, but I didn't.

17:24.252 --> 17:25.932
I just found Linda and
became a meth freak.

17:29.799 --> 17:33.645
Jesus fucking Christ, I want
to be happy so fucking bad.

17:45.314 --> 17:48.659
He came home at one
point and met the family

17:48.943 --> 17:53.949
and asked our father formally
for her hand in marriage.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.242
Well, now it's Saturday,

17:56.534 --> 17:59.003
and you're letter didn't come.

17:59.287 --> 18:01.289
So I'm very sad and
moping around the house,

18:01.581 --> 18:03.629
and mother's worried.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.338
Baby, what's happening?

18:05.626 --> 18:09.221
You could really be hurting
me, and, hell, I couldn't tell.

18:09.505 --> 18:11.178
Am <i>I</i> still happy?

18:11.465 --> 18:14.514
Do I still have you?

18:14.802 --> 18:16.122
She was embarrassed
that he wasn't

18:16.220 --> 18:17.580
going to show up
after she had told

18:17.638 --> 18:20.437
her mom and dad that he was.

18:20.725 --> 18:23.945
He was evidently living with a
woman who he'd gotten pregnant.

18:24.228 --> 18:27.277
And Janis only discovered that
when she happened to call him,

18:27.565 --> 18:29.045
and this woman
answered the telephone.

18:36.699 --> 18:38.292
Do you ever go
back to Port Arthur?

18:38.576 --> 18:39.919
I went back once.

18:40.202 --> 18:43.547
It's a... it's a bummer, and
I ain't going back again.

18:43.831 --> 18:46.505
No, it's no good.

18:46.792 --> 18:50.717
Chet asked me to come
and see his new band,

18:51.005 --> 18:55.681
and that's when I heard that Big
Brother was auditioning women.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.767
So I went by his house and said,
you know, I'm going to go home.

18:59.055 --> 19:01.149
I can ask about
Janis if you like.

19:01.432 --> 19:03.651
And she found out
that I was there,

19:03.934 --> 19:06.062
and we spent the whole
day talking about what was

19:06.354 --> 19:08.573
going on since she had left.

19:08.856 --> 19:10.824
And we should go see
a rock and roll band,

19:11.108 --> 19:13.907
and there's one playing
around the corner.

19:14.195 --> 19:17.870
Didn't have anything to
drink because she was sober.

19:18.157 --> 19:22.333
And we listened to, I think,
two songs, and she turned to me

19:22.620 --> 19:25.089
and she said, that's
what I want to do.

19:25.373 --> 19:26.044
So I said, OK.

19:26.332 --> 19:27.332
Let's go figure this out.

19:27.541 --> 19:29.464
He said, I'm not
going to go and take

19:29.752 --> 19:31.925
it till you tell your parents.

19:32.213 --> 19:36.434
He waited in the car while Janis
went in to tell her parents.

19:36.717 --> 19:39.812
Janis went in and said she was
going to Austin for the weekend

19:40.096 --> 19:42.975
and left and went
to San Francisco.

19:51.273 --> 19:53.367
Mother and
Dad, with a great deal of

19:53.651 --> 19:56.530
trepidation, I bring the news.

19:56.821 --> 19:58.539
I am in San Francisco.

19:58.823 --> 20:00.666
Now, let me explain.

20:00.950 --> 20:05.080
Chet Helms, an old friend,
now is Mr. Big in SF.

20:05.371 --> 20:07.499
He encouraged me to come out.

20:07.790 --> 20:10.964
Seems the whole city had gone
rock and roll, and it has.

20:11.252 --> 20:15.849
And he assured me fame
and fortune, so I came.

20:16.132 --> 20:17.975
I'm so sorry.

20:18.259 --> 20:20.432
My love to Mike and Laura.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.098
Love, Janis.

20:51.333 --> 20:52.880
I would pick her
up, and I'd drive her

20:53.169 --> 20:54.512
back to where she was staying.

20:54.795 --> 20:58.516
I mean, she was always like,
I don't know whether this

20:58.799 --> 20:59.846
is going to work out.

21:00.134 --> 21:03.058
I probably... I should
go back to Texas.

21:03.345 --> 21:05.063
I don't know if
I should do this.

21:05.347 --> 21:06.690
She had a lot of misgivings.

21:06.974 --> 21:09.523
She was very afraid of drugs.

21:12.688 --> 21:16.067
She said, I don't ever want
to see anybody shooting drugs.

21:16.358 --> 21:19.953
I can't stand to see that
because if I see that,

21:20.237 --> 21:22.831
it's just going to
take her out so much.

21:23.115 --> 21:24.555
She came out to San
Francisco and had

21:24.784 --> 21:26.661
this coffeehouse career.

21:26.952 --> 21:28.249
She almost died that time.

21:28.537 --> 21:29.914
She lost all this
weight, you know,

21:30.206 --> 21:31.674
and she went back to Texas.

21:31.957 --> 21:34.631
And her mother said, if you
ever go back out there again,

21:34.919 --> 21:35.919
you're going to die.

21:53.020 --> 21:56.024
Parents encourage
you to sing at all?

21:56.315 --> 21:58.693
Oh, no, no, no, they wanted
me to be a schoolteacher,

21:58.984 --> 22:01.578
you know, like all parents.

22:01.862 --> 22:05.082
But I started singing
when I was about 17.

22:05.366 --> 22:06.913
I listened to a
lot of music first,

22:07.201 --> 22:08.453
and one day I started singing.

22:08.744 --> 22:09.996
And I could sing.

22:10.287 --> 22:14.008
It was, like, it was a
surprise, to say the least.

22:27.429 --> 22:29.932
Dear Mother
and Dad, Daddy brought up

22:30.224 --> 22:31.864
the college issue,
which is good because I

22:31.976 --> 22:34.946
probably would have continued
avoiding it until it went away.

22:35.229 --> 22:37.152
I don't think I can go back now.

22:37.439 --> 22:39.543
I don't know all the reasons,
but I just feel that this

22:39.567 --> 22:42.286
a truer feeling, true to me.

22:42.570 --> 22:43.913
I don't feel like I'm lying now.

22:52.413 --> 22:54.211
I have to see this
through first.

22:54.498 --> 22:56.418
If I don't, I'd always be
thinking about singing,

22:56.500 --> 22:59.128
being good and known, and
feel like I cheated myself,

22:59.420 --> 23:00.420
you know?

23:08.012 --> 23:10.515
Weak as it is, I
apologize for being so

23:10.806 --> 23:13.434
just plain bad in the family.

23:13.726 --> 23:16.400
I'm just sorry, love, Janis.

23:21.025 --> 23:22.572
We're all primitive musicians.

23:22.860 --> 23:25.363
We're self-taught.

23:25.654 --> 23:26.894
We don't know much about music.

23:27.072 --> 23:29.370
We're not trained in the
music that we're doing.

23:29.658 --> 23:30.818
We've all sort of come to it.

23:31.911 --> 23:34.505
I was trained on
triangle and tuba.

23:34.788 --> 23:36.016
Tuba, you weren't house trained.

23:36.040 --> 23:37.225
You're a great
triangle player, baby.

23:37.249 --> 23:38.842
I wasn't even house trained.

23:39.126 --> 23:40.799
Go outside.

23:41.086 --> 23:43.088
I used to be sort of
like a blues singer.

23:43.380 --> 23:44.552
And Jimmy Swift.

23:44.840 --> 23:45.840
Jimmy Swift?

23:45.925 --> 23:47.205
She used to be a
baseball player,

23:47.301 --> 23:50.100
and she always used
to say, sock it to me.

23:50.387 --> 23:52.435
Folk blues, you know,
I was a folk singer,

23:52.723 --> 23:56.444
you know, and sang blues mostly,
country blues, old time blues,

23:56.727 --> 23:58.604
slow.

23:58.896 --> 24:00.398
Didn't you have a
job soldering once?

24:00.689 --> 24:01.360
Soldering?

24:01.649 --> 24:02.649
No, a key punch operator.

24:02.858 --> 24:04.075
It was a back then.

24:04.360 --> 24:06.738
I was a waitress in a
bowling alley once, too.

24:07.029 --> 24:10.374
Playing is like the
mostest fun there is.

24:10.658 --> 24:14.162
Feeling things and really
getting into it, that's fun.

24:24.046 --> 24:26.515
At that time,
there was definitely

24:26.799 --> 24:28.221
a sense Of camaraderie.

24:28.509 --> 24:32.230
If you knew the Grateful Dead
had the house on Ashbury,

24:32.513 --> 24:35.608
it Wouldn't be unlikely that
if you were in the neighborhood

24:35.891 --> 24:38.110
you'd just drop by and
hang out with those guys

24:38.394 --> 24:40.442
and smoke a joint or
something like that.

24:44.108 --> 24:47.533
We were all sort of riding the
same wave in a sense, all part

24:47.820 --> 24:50.539
of the same scene, and
all shared, in some ways,

24:50.823 --> 24:52.791
the same values
that we were par':

24:53.075 --> 24:56.830
of this counterculture,
revolutionary music thing that

24:57.121 --> 24:58.794
was going to change the world.

25:06.505 --> 25:11.602
She was just funny,
unassuming, sexy,

25:11.885 --> 25:15.185
and sort of a kind of, like,
almost a sort of Huck Finn

25:15.472 --> 25:19.648
innocence to her, the
absolutely child-woman

25:19.935 --> 25:21.562
ideal of the.

25:21.854 --> 25:24.448
Well, I met Janis as
a romantic interest

25:24.732 --> 25:29.203
for one of my band mates,
Pigpen, Ron McKernan.

25:29.486 --> 25:31.614
We called him the Mighty Pig.

25:31.905 --> 25:35.785
It was an on again, off again
little affair that they had.

25:36.076 --> 25:38.750
And on the nights that Janis
would come over and visit,

25:39.038 --> 25:41.132
I got very little
sleep because Janis

25:41.415 --> 25:45.340
was not real quiet in the rack.

25:45.627 --> 25:48.221
And so all night long, it
would be, daddy, daddy,

25:48.505 --> 25:52.931
daddy, all that kind of
stuff, I mean, but endlessly.

25:53.218 --> 25:55.061
Isn't Pigpen cute?

25:55.345 --> 25:57.145
They make Pigpen T-shirts
now with his picture

25:57.222 --> 25:58.222
on it for fans.

25:58.307 --> 25:59.934
I have one in red.

26:00.225 --> 26:01.693
Those people are
all friends of mine.

26:01.977 --> 26:03.024
Aren't they amazing?

26:03.312 --> 26:04.832
The people with stars
after their names

26:05.064 --> 26:06.407
are members of the band.

26:06.690 --> 26:10.786
I'm in the back on the left,
really an amazing picture.

26:11.070 --> 26:12.070
They aren't dressed up.

26:12.237 --> 26:13.659
They look that way all the time.

26:13.947 --> 26:17.121
Now, taken in perspective,
I'm not so far out at all, eh'?

26:25.167 --> 26:26.339
There was a party.

26:26.627 --> 26:30.052
There was a party in
the city at an apartment

26:30.339 --> 26:32.467
on California Street.

26:32.758 --> 26:35.181
Someone opened this bottle
model of this stuff.

26:35.469 --> 26:36.469
It's called Cold Duck.

26:36.678 --> 26:37.349
You don't sit it around much.

26:37.638 --> 26:38.935
Sparkling wine.

26:39.223 --> 26:41.476
Sparkling wine, and it
started to go around the room,

26:41.767 --> 26:43.127
and people were
taking chugs of it.

26:43.227 --> 26:45.446
And Janis took a big swig of it.

26:45.729 --> 26:47.276
And someone said to
Janis, oh, man, you

26:47.564 --> 26:49.407
must really want to get high.

26:49.691 --> 26:51.819
And she just went, like, what?

26:52.111 --> 26:53.838
And someone said, yeah,
there's, like, you know,

26:53.862 --> 26:56.490
60, 80 hits of acid in
that bottle of Cold Duck.

26:56.782 --> 27:00.787
Anyway, she ran into the
bathroom and tried to throw up.

27:06.416 --> 27:10.762
But she got very high, anyway,
and we went from this party

27:11.046 --> 27:12.046
to the Fillmore.

27:26.854 --> 27:29.323
And Otis Redding was I
think in his second night,

27:29.606 --> 27:31.028
and it was his second show.

27:31.316 --> 27:33.545
They did two shows, so there
weren't a lot of people there.

27:33.569 --> 27:35.412
And I remember sitting with her.

27:35.696 --> 27:37.869
We sat down in the
middle of the floor,

27:38.157 --> 27:40.080
and Otis Redding came
out with his band.

27:46.081 --> 27:49.881
I think when she saw him and
so the way he moved and how

27:50.169 --> 27:52.763
he interpreted a song, I
really think it very much

27:53.046 --> 27:54.423
affected her.

27:54.715 --> 27:56.568
I mean, literally, she'd start
doing this got to, go to,

27:56.592 --> 27:57.093
go to.

27:57.384 --> 27:58.384
She stole that.

28:05.225 --> 28:06.977
Billie Holiday, Aretha Franklin,

28:07.269 --> 28:09.613
now, they are so subtle.

28:09.897 --> 28:13.117
They can milk you
with two notes.

28:13.400 --> 28:16.279
They could go no
farther from A to B,

28:16.570 --> 28:18.131
and they could make you
feel like they told you

28:18.155 --> 28:20.203
the whole universe, you know?

28:20.490 --> 28:21.867
And Otis, too.

28:22.159 --> 28:26.335
And Otis, oh, Otis, my man,
but I don't know that yet.

28:26.622 --> 28:31.594
All I got now is strength,
but maybe if I keep singing,

28:31.877 --> 28:32.548
maybe I'll get it.

28:32.836 --> 28:33.836
That's what I think.

28:48.894 --> 28:50.612
Mother,
haven't heard from you yet.

28:50.896 --> 28:52.944
But I'm brimming with
news, so here I am.

28:53.232 --> 28:54.700
Last weekend, we
played in the city,

28:54.983 --> 28:59.284
and a man from Elektra, a good
label, spoke to me afterwards.

28:59.571 --> 29:01.073
Rothchild feels
that popular music

29:01.365 --> 29:03.083
can't continue getting
farther and farther

29:03.367 --> 29:04.619
out and more chaotic.

29:04.910 --> 29:06.628
He feels there's going
to be a reaction,

29:06.912 --> 29:09.461
and old-fashioned music...
Blues, shuffles, melodic stuff...

29:09.748 --> 29:11.216
Is going to come back in.

29:11.500 --> 29:14.049
Well, Elektra wants to form
the group to be this way,

29:14.336 --> 29:16.179
and they want me.

29:16.463 --> 29:18.650
Wish I could ask someone for
advice that knew and wasn't

29:18.674 --> 29:20.176
biased for any reason.

29:20.467 --> 29:21.889
Ah, dream on, Janis.

29:31.561 --> 29:34.531
We thought maybe we
could get Janis to be

29:34.815 --> 29:36.237
more locked into the group.

29:36.525 --> 29:38.368
I took her down the hill,
down a little pathway

29:38.652 --> 29:40.450
here through the
woods, and talked

29:40.737 --> 29:42.034
to her all about this stuff.

29:42.322 --> 29:46.828
And a lot of what you would
say the American dream

29:47.119 --> 29:53.798
of most girls in the '50s and
'60s came out at that time.

29:54.084 --> 29:56.837
She said, you know, I've
dreamed about all this stuff

29:57.129 --> 29:59.757
all my life, being on the
cover of these magazines

30:00.048 --> 30:04.895
and having a fancy car and
living in a fancy home.

30:05.178 --> 30:06.350
And I don't know what to do.

30:06.638 --> 30:09.016
I mean, you guys are
good stuff, but, I mean-

30:09.308 --> 30:11.468
and I said, you know, a lot
of that stuff was bullshit,

30:11.685 --> 30:13.232
and give us a chance.

30:13.520 --> 30:14.520
Give us a month.

30:17.357 --> 30:21.282
Bobby Shad from Mainstream
Records, he offered us a deal,

30:21.570 --> 30:25.200
and so we signed this
bad record contract.

30:25.490 --> 30:27.413
And at the same
time, in doing so,

30:27.701 --> 30:30.796
we were kind of locking in Janis
and that she knew what she was

30:31.079 --> 30:32.956
doing, that she was
in some way locking

30:33.248 --> 30:37.344
herself in with the band
for at least a few years.

30:37.627 --> 30:38.987
It was good that
she stayed with us

30:39.254 --> 30:40.756
because we let her alone.

30:41.048 --> 30:43.847
You know, we weren't talented
enough to get in her way.

30:44.134 --> 30:44.805
You know what I mean?

30:45.093 --> 30:46.310
We weren't strong enough.

30:46.595 --> 30:49.394
But those guys, you know,
Paul Rothchild, they

30:49.681 --> 30:50.807
would have eaten her alive.

30:51.099 --> 30:54.899
They would have shoved
her over in the corner,

30:55.187 --> 30:57.531
as much as you could
shove Janis in the corner.

31:01.068 --> 31:03.036
In the very
beginning, she didn't

31:03.320 --> 31:04.913
take over as, I'm the singer.

31:05.197 --> 31:06.289
I'm the lead singer.

31:06.573 --> 31:08.667
She really tried to
integrate into the band

31:08.950 --> 31:10.076
and be part of it.

31:10.369 --> 31:12.918
The big turning point
was Monterey Pop.

31:17.167 --> 31:20.671
A very good friend of mine
said, you've got to come

31:20.962 --> 31:23.135
to the Monterey Pop Festival.

31:23.423 --> 31:24.845
There's never been
a Pop Festival.

31:27.761 --> 31:29.481
You know, you're going
to have a great time.

31:29.554 --> 31:30.554
It's a weekend.

31:30.597 --> 31:32.270
It's in Monterey, California.

31:32.557 --> 31:35.356
Simon and Garfunkel were
going to perform there.

31:35.644 --> 31:38.022
That's all I knew about.

31:38.313 --> 31:46.313
So I came here with my khaki
pants and a tennis sweater,

31:46.947 --> 31:52.295
and I was astonished by
everything that I saw.

31:52.577 --> 31:55.046
I got a call from
Lou Adler, who was

31:55.330 --> 31:56.490
the producer of Monterey Pop.

31:56.706 --> 31:59.835
He was also the manager of
the Mamas and the Papas.

32:00.127 --> 32:03.802
He told me there's
in the Monterey Pop Festival.

32:04.089 --> 32:06.763
Well, Big Brother, come.

32:07.050 --> 32:08.050
I saw the future.

32:19.813 --> 32:22.657
He offered me a number,
and I went for it.

32:22.941 --> 32:24.568
I didn't give a damn
about the money.

32:24.860 --> 32:27.864
I knew that this was
going to be a monster.

32:34.119 --> 32:37.714
So I vividly remember
sitting in the grounds

32:37.998 --> 32:41.753
there, being surrounded
by this unusual crowd,

32:42.043 --> 32:44.262
and then they
announced the group.

32:44.546 --> 32:48.722
Three or four years ago,
I ran into a chick in Texas

32:49.009 --> 32:55.642
by the name of Janis Joplin,
and I heard her sing.

32:55.932 --> 32:59.186
And Janis and I hitchhiked
to the West Coast.

32:59.478 --> 33:02.357
A lot of things have gone
down since that time,

33:02.647 --> 33:04.991
but it gives me a
great deal of pride

33:05.275 --> 33:08.324
to present today
the finished product

33:08.612 --> 33:10.580
of three or four years
of work, Big Brother

33:10.864 --> 33:12.036
and the Holding Company.

33:24.419 --> 33:27.013
We had been told
about Monterey Pop

33:27.297 --> 33:29.641
that it was going
to be a big party,

33:29.925 --> 33:31.222
and everybody's
playing for free.

33:31.510 --> 33:32.950
And no one's going
to make any money.

33:33.053 --> 33:35.226
And then all of a sudden
there's a movie being made

33:35.514 --> 33:36.936
by DA Pennebaker,
and they're asking

33:37.224 --> 33:40.945
everybody to sign a release
just before you get on stage.

33:41.228 --> 33:42.946
I thought everybody
in this country

33:43.230 --> 33:44.652
is dying to get
out to California

33:44.940 --> 33:46.567
to see what's going on.

33:46.858 --> 33:50.613
And so, without even
thinking, I said, sure.

33:50.904 --> 33:54.659
Lou Adler wanted me to sign,
as he had everybody sign,

33:54.950 --> 33:56.042
the contract for the movie.

33:56.326 --> 33:57.623
And I said, no.

33:57.911 --> 34:00.710
And he kept on it,
and I kept saying, no.

34:00.997 --> 34:04.376
There was a whole sort of San
Francisco kind of contingent

34:04.668 --> 34:05.988
that was of the
sort of philosophy

34:06.211 --> 34:08.134
that these LA guys
are not going to make

34:08.420 --> 34:10.014
a movie out of out stuff.

34:10.297 --> 34:11.567
We're not going to
be in your movie.

34:11.591 --> 34:13.217
We just came for the party.

34:13.510 --> 34:19.016
There were nine big machine-gun
cameras around the arena.

34:19.306 --> 34:22.356
All nine cameras were
pointed down to the ground.

34:22.643 --> 34:24.817
Now, they're starting
to come off stage.

34:25.105 --> 34:26.947
People are starting
to tell them.

34:27.232 --> 34:27.824
This wasn't filmed.

34:28.108 --> 34:28.609
This wasn't filmed.

34:28.900 --> 34:30.822
This wasn't filmed.

34:31.110 --> 34:34.489
But Janis is really pissed off.

34:34.781 --> 34:36.909
They got to Janis, John Phillips

34:37.199 --> 34:39.873
and Lou Adler and these
people, and they said, look.

34:40.161 --> 34:41.504
We'll put you on again.

34:41.788 --> 34:43.891
We'll give you a second show
if you'll be in the movie.

34:43.915 --> 34:47.293
And to make a long story short,
there was a lot of infighting

34:47.585 --> 34:50.304
amongst the band
and our manager.

34:50.589 --> 34:52.056
Grossman was involved, too.

34:52.340 --> 34:54.342
And Albert Grossman
got involved.

34:54.634 --> 34:56.101
I went to Albert,
and I said, Albert,

34:56.386 --> 34:57.466
I know what you have to do.

34:57.596 --> 35:00.440
But you better find
a way to get her

35:00.724 --> 35:04.649
so that we can film her because
she's really critical to this.

35:04.936 --> 35:07.109
This group we'd
like to bring on now

35:07.397 --> 35:10.367
because of the great acceptance
they had on Saturday afternoon.

35:16.865 --> 35:19.038
From San Francisco,
on Mainstream Records,

35:19.326 --> 35:21.920
let's hear it for Big Brother
and the Holding Company.

35:27.459 --> 35:29.803
Cass was sitting there
in one of the rows,

35:30.086 --> 35:33.932
and I kind of had an
eye on her during Janis

35:34.215 --> 35:38.015
because they had been a
little critical because they

35:38.303 --> 35:39.304
were Los Angelenos.

35:39.596 --> 35:42.145
And the Los Angelenos
were somewhat

35:42.432 --> 35:45.185
critical of the San Franciscans
in terms of the bands.

35:45.477 --> 35:49.573
And so I kind of wanted to
watch her when Janis sang.

35:57.197 --> 36:01.452
Sitting down by my window,

36:01.743 --> 36:05.748
just looking out at the rain.

36:13.963 --> 36:19.265
Something came along,
honey, grabbed a hold of me,

36:19.552 --> 36:24.399
and it felt like
a ball and chain.

36:24.683 --> 36:29.814
Well, yeah.

36:30.105 --> 36:36.363
And I said, oh, oh, oh,
well, honey, this can't be.

36:36.653 --> 36:42.001
This can't be in vain.

36:42.283 --> 36:48.290
Na, na, na, na,
na, na, na, and I

36:48.581 --> 36:54.213
said, oh, oh, oh, well,
honey, oh, this can't be

36:54.504 --> 36:59.180
b... b... b... baby, not in vain.

36:59.467 --> 37:06.601
I said, no, no,
no, no, yeah, whoa,

37:06.891 --> 37:10.521
and I want somebody
to tell me, come on.

37:10.812 --> 37:15.989
And tell me why, why, 0h,
people tell me why love,

37:16.276 --> 37:24.276
honey, why love is like, well,
it's like a ball and a chain.

38:08.328 --> 38:11.332
Once she caught real
recognition at the Monterey Pop

38:11.623 --> 38:15.048
Festival, I think
she began to see

38:15.335 --> 38:16.837
what the possibilities were.

38:17.128 --> 38:20.348
And the possibilities were
somewhat over the top.

38:25.220 --> 38:29.646
Dear Mother, at
last, a tranquil day and time

38:29.933 --> 38:31.526
to write all the good news.

38:31.810 --> 38:35.030
I'm now safely moved into my
new room in our beautiful house

38:35.313 --> 38:36.940
in the country.

38:37.232 --> 38:40.236
Gosh, I can't seem to find
anything else to talk about.

38:40.527 --> 38:42.529
This band is my whole life now.

38:42.821 --> 38:46.371
I really am totally
committed, and I dig it.

38:46.658 --> 38:48.098
I wanted to send
you these clippings.

38:48.243 --> 38:51.087
Since Monterey, all
this has come about.

38:51.371 --> 38:53.373
Did "Port Arthur News"
have anything on these?

38:53.665 --> 38:55.417
If so, please send.

38:55.708 --> 38:57.927
I just may be a star someday.

38:58.211 --> 38:59.428
You know, it's funny.

38:59.712 --> 39:01.760
As it gets closer and more
probable, being a star

39:02.048 --> 39:03.516
is really losing its meaning.

39:03.800 --> 39:06.849
But whatever it
means, I'm ready.

39:07.136 --> 39:09.355
Things are going so
well for me personally.

39:09.639 --> 39:11.061
I have a boyfriend.

39:11.349 --> 39:14.853
He's head of Country Joe and
the Fish, a band from Berkeley.

39:15.144 --> 39:17.613
He' a Capricorn
like me and is 25,

39:17.897 --> 39:19.820
and so far we're
getting along fine.

39:20.108 --> 39:21.588
Everyone in the rock
scene just thinks

39:21.776 --> 39:23.295
it's the cutest thing
they've ever seen,

39:23.319 --> 39:24.571
and it is rather cute actually.

39:28.199 --> 39:30.577
Oh, we were never in
love with each other.

39:30.869 --> 39:36.046
No, no, there was
no sizzle going on.

39:36.332 --> 39:38.255
We were good friends.

39:38.543 --> 39:41.843
We were both control
freaks, both lead singers.

39:42.130 --> 39:44.758
There was a maternal
feminine side of her

39:45.049 --> 39:48.679
that never was allowed to grow.

39:48.970 --> 39:51.723
She was really trying
hard, you know,

39:52.015 --> 39:53.813
and her mother was
coming to town.

39:54.100 --> 39:55.977
She wanted to cook chow
mein for her mother.

39:56.269 --> 39:58.146
She was so worried
that her mother

39:58.438 --> 39:59.860
would like her apartment.

40:00.148 --> 40:02.992
And had just
made that poster of her naked

40:03.276 --> 40:04.823
with the necklaces.

40:05.111 --> 40:06.351
We put them all up on the wall.

40:09.991 --> 40:13.370
We went out to visit her the
Summer of Love as a family.

40:13.661 --> 40:15.834
My brother and I were the
only teenagers who probably

40:16.122 --> 40:17.499
went outwith their parents.

40:17.790 --> 40:18.950
You know, we go to see Janis.

40:19.042 --> 40:20.402
And we're walking
down the streets.

40:20.460 --> 40:24.090
She's showing us around,
and I was so excited.

40:24.380 --> 40:26.132
Then We went to the
Avalon Ballroom,

40:26.424 --> 40:30.349
and Big Brother was not
on the bill that night.

40:30.637 --> 40:32.935
But they went on and
did three or four songs.

40:33.222 --> 40:35.975
Moby Grape let them have
a set because Janis's

40:36.267 --> 40:38.895
parents were there.

40:39.187 --> 40:41.281
When we were getting
ready to leave,

40:41.564 --> 40:45.865
I remember overhearing one of
my parents tell the other one,

40:46.152 --> 40:48.530
you know, dear, I
don't think we're going

40:48.821 --> 40:50.289
to have much influence anymore.

40:57.330 --> 41:00.755
I think that her own
telling of her story

41:01.042 --> 41:06.390
was about the ability to make
your life fit your values,

41:06.673 --> 41:09.722
and she found that
opportunity in the music

41:10.009 --> 41:17.439
world of the 1960s.

41:17.725 --> 41:20.854
The social acceptance that
she'd always wanted was there,

41:21.145 --> 41:23.489
and it just propelled
her forward.

41:23.773 --> 41:24.319
Come on.

41:24.607 --> 41:26.280
Come on.

41:26.567 --> 41:27.784
Come on.

41:28.069 --> 41:29.321
Come on.

41:29.612 --> 41:37.612
Didn't I make you feel
like you were the only man?

41:38.997 --> 41:42.376
It felt so fresh
and so different

41:42.667 --> 41:43.987
for someone who'd
been an outcast.

41:47.588 --> 41:50.842
Each time I tell myself that I,

41:51.134 --> 41:53.307
well, I think I've had enough.

41:53.594 --> 41:59.317
But I'm gonna show you, baby,
that a woman can be tough.

41:59.600 --> 42:00.772
I want you to come on.

42:01.060 --> 42:02.733
Come on.

42:03.021 --> 42:04.238
Come on.

42:04.522 --> 42:05.739
Come on.

42:06.024 --> 42:07.241
Take it.

42:07.525 --> 42:11.155
Take another little piece
of my heart now, baby.

42:11.446 --> 42:12.618
Break it.

42:12.905 --> 42:17.581
Break another little piece
of my heart, oh, yeah.

42:17.869 --> 42:19.041
Come on.

42:19.328 --> 42:23.458
Take another little piece
of my heart now, baby.

42:23.750 --> 42:28.256
You know you got it if
it makes you feel good.

42:31.382 --> 42:33.805
You've got another
manager, Albert Grossman,

42:34.093 --> 42:35.811
who also manages Bob Dylan.

42:36.095 --> 42:39.599
Yeah, he's better.

42:39.891 --> 42:42.565
Dear Mother,
<i>as</i> of yesterday afternoon,

42:42.852 --> 42:44.650
we're officially with Columbia.

42:44.937 --> 42:46.814
Wow, I'm so lucky.

42:47.106 --> 42:51.327
25, 25, 25, it's
all too incredible.

42:51.611 --> 42:53.784
I just fumbled around
being a mixed-up kid

42:54.072 --> 42:55.619
and then fell into this.

42:55.907 --> 42:57.267
Finally, it looks
like something is

42:57.366 --> 42:58.646
gonna work for me... incredible.

43:09.295 --> 43:13.175
February 20, 1968,
Dear Mother, our record

43:13.466 --> 43:15.013
is a success story in itself.

43:15.301 --> 43:17.895
We got a gold album
in three days,

43:18.179 --> 43:20.932
and the most fantastic thing of
all happened at the Rose Bowl.

43:21.224 --> 43:23.304
The cops wouldn't let the
kids off the grass near us.

43:23.518 --> 43:25.771
And all of a sudden they
broke, just like a wave,

43:26.062 --> 43:27.609
and swarmed onto the field.

43:27.897 --> 43:30.320
They were pulling on my
clothes, my beads, calling,

43:30.608 --> 43:33.031
Janis, Janis, we love you.

43:33.319 --> 43:34.536
Come on.

43:34.821 --> 43:38.917
Take another little piece
of my heart now baby.

43:39.200 --> 43:43.797
You know you got it, man,
if it makes you feel good.

43:46.874 --> 43:50.845
She had a sense that as long
as people gave her the stage,

43:51.129 --> 43:52.129
she would be a winner.

43:59.470 --> 44:00.767
Let's sit down, boys.

44:01.055 --> 44:02.272
Come on, boys.

44:02.557 --> 44:04.935
Let's sit down.

44:05.226 --> 44:07.274
Here we are, sitting down.

44:07.562 --> 44:09.189
Almost everybody's sitting down.

44:09.480 --> 44:10.026
Oh, yes.

44:10.314 --> 44:12.316
Fantastic.

44:12.608 --> 44:14.360
Is there a San Francisco sound?

44:14.652 --> 44:16.825
And if so, what is it,
and how did it start?

44:17.113 --> 44:19.433
The thing that makes what they
call the San Francisco music

44:19.657 --> 44:21.830
scene, as far as I'm concerned,
is, like, first of all,

44:22.118 --> 44:23.791
the freedom to create here.

44:24.078 --> 44:26.078
You know, for some reason,
like, a lot of musicians

44:26.205 --> 44:28.003
ended up here and
ended up together

44:28.291 --> 44:30.760
and had complete freedom to
do whatever they wanted to.

44:31.043 --> 44:32.966
And so they came up with
their own kind of music.

44:33.254 --> 44:36.258
What do you think, Sam?

44:40.052 --> 44:41.052
Honey.

44:45.766 --> 44:47.359
That's what we call
love music, baby.

45:01.407 --> 45:04.160
Not bad.

45:04.452 --> 45:05.971
Well, here we are,
together again at last,

45:05.995 --> 45:07.167
by popular demand.
- Honey.

45:07.455 --> 45:08.126
How are ya?

45:08.414 --> 45:09.558
Yeah, I don't know what it was.

45:09.582 --> 45:10.959
We sort of hit it
off right away.

45:11.250 --> 45:13.844
Was she romantically
attached to me?

45:14.128 --> 45:15.801
I would hope so.

45:16.088 --> 45:17.368
May I light your fire, my child?

45:21.010 --> 45:22.010
I guess not.

45:22.261 --> 45:24.730
Apparently not,
no, well, I would

45:25.014 --> 45:26.186
have bet against it myself.

45:26.474 --> 45:27.474
We were good friends.

45:27.516 --> 45:29.689
And I will level with you.

45:29.977 --> 45:37.577
We may or may not have
ended up intimate.

45:37.860 --> 45:40.283
I just, you know,
my memory is so bad.

45:43.157 --> 45:44.157
Or so good.

45:46.911 --> 45:49.790
We lived in the
Chelsea Hotel while we

45:50.081 --> 45:52.504
were making Cheap Thrills
and while we were touring.

45:52.792 --> 45:54.044
And we lived in Los Angeles.

45:54.335 --> 45:56.212
About half the time,
we were in Hollywood,

45:56.504 --> 46:00.008
and half the time we were at
the Chelsea Hotel in Manhattan.

46:00.299 --> 46:02.472
And it was just so much fun.

46:02.760 --> 46:07.436
You know, we would get together
and do heroin at these people's

46:07.723 --> 46:13.401
rooms and just kind of not nod
off or go to sleep or something

46:13.688 --> 46:16.692
but just have really nice
mellow conversations.

46:41.257 --> 46:46.138
She liked New York, and it had
that tombstone quality for her.

46:46.429 --> 46:49.353
And so I was going to do a
little film with her because I

46:49.640 --> 46:50.812
really liked her a lot.

46:51.100 --> 46:55.446
And she was recording
stuff with the band,

46:55.730 --> 46:59.155
and I would go and
listen and film them.

47:02.320 --> 47:06.917
I was interested mostly in
how she understood to control

47:07.199 --> 47:09.327
her singing because
her singing had

47:09.618 --> 47:15.000
this thing of when she'd lose
it, she would shout and scream.

47:15.291 --> 47:18.761
And sometimes that
was very effective,

47:19.045 --> 47:21.969
but the music had to have
something more to it than that.

47:32.933 --> 47:36.563
Liar, I think it's a
real good-liar, liar.

47:36.854 --> 47:37.946
Let's do Summertime.

47:38.230 --> 47:41.325
OK, let's go.

47:53.996 --> 47:59.469
Play the second one,
when she goes, no, no, no,

47:59.752 --> 48:00.878
don't you cry.

48:01.170 --> 48:05.596
No, no, no,
no, no, don't you cry.

48:05.883 --> 48:07.003
At the very end of the song.

48:07.259 --> 48:08.779
End of the song, the
last chord of the song.

48:08.803 --> 48:12.353
You're first G major
arpeggio, I think, is wrong.

48:12.640 --> 48:13.857
That's when she says, cry.

48:14.141 --> 48:16.439
What do you want, like,
six arpeggios of G minor?

48:16.727 --> 48:18.647
Because it changes to B
minor for two after that.

48:18.854 --> 48:19.854
He's already in a major.

48:19.897 --> 48:21.097
He's trying to get in a minor.

48:25.820 --> 48:26.912
We can do it either way.

48:27.196 --> 48:29.073
I mean, they're both
valid approaches.

48:29.365 --> 48:31.208
But I think if we...
Like, it's 10 o'clock.

48:31.492 --> 48:33.836
I think by 4:00 we
could have Summertime.

48:34.120 --> 48:36.794
I'd say if we don't do it
by 12 o'clock or 1 o'clock,

48:37.081 --> 48:39.101
we can spend a few hours doing
something else, you know?

48:39.125 --> 48:41.719
If you all voted to do
a bunch of them tonight,

48:42.002 --> 48:43.002
it's OK with me.

48:43.212 --> 48:44.398
But I personally
don't agree with it.

48:44.422 --> 48:45.782
Playing it and
listening to it back

48:46.006 --> 48:47.849
ain't gonna take
us a damn thing.

48:48.134 --> 48:50.182
Man, I know exactly what
that song sounds like,

48:50.469 --> 48:52.549
and I've racked my brain to
try and get ideas for it,

48:52.638 --> 48:53.890
as I'm sure everybody else has.

48:54.181 --> 48:55.701
D major and D minor
sing don't you cry.

48:55.933 --> 48:56.952
I don't even know what it says.

48:56.976 --> 48:58.148
Turn that mic thing off.

48:58.436 --> 49:00.438
OK,.

49:00.729 --> 49:02.356
Hey, don't go away.

49:40.060 --> 49:41.580
You look so cute when
you're passed out.

49:41.604 --> 49:42.275
You look just like a hot dog.

49:42.563 --> 49:43.563
OK.

49:48.194 --> 49:49.194
OK, good time.

49:56.368 --> 49:57.888
You dug it the first
time you heard it.

49:57.912 --> 49:58.912
Yeah, I did dig it.

49:59.163 --> 50:00.223
I did dig it the
first time I heard it.

50:00.247 --> 50:01.373
I also liked the other way.

50:01.665 --> 50:04.885
I mean, I think maybe an
adaptation or.

50:05.169 --> 50:07.547
Yeah, right, because, like,
yours had a lot of lyricism

50:07.838 --> 50:11.388
to it, but this has nothing
but-frenetic is the word.

50:51.006 --> 50:56.006
Oh, one of
these mornings, child,

51:01.600 --> 51:03.819
you'll rise up singing, babe.

51:08.065 --> 51:14.914
I said you're gonna go, honey,
gonna spread your wings.

51:15.197 --> 51:18.792
Honey, take, take to the sky.

51:21.912 --> 51:22.912
Move the sky.

51:26.208 --> 51:31.208
Until that morning, honey, no,
nothing's gonna harm you, baby.

51:39.346 --> 51:42.395
I said, honey, nothings
ever gonna let you down.

51:42.683 --> 51:44.936
Oh, it just wouldn't do it.

51:45.227 --> 51:51.451
Hush, baby, baby,
baby, baby, baby, baby.

51:51.734 --> 51:53.953
No, no, no, no, don't you cry.

52:13.464 --> 52:17.264
Janis Joplin and the Holding
Company, aren't they great?

52:17.551 --> 52:19.613
Absolutely great, Janis, I just
thought you were wonderful.

52:19.637 --> 52:22.516
You know, you were written up
recently in "Life Magazine,"

52:22.806 --> 52:24.353
and I have a copy here.

52:24.642 --> 52:26.360
And I'd like to read
what you were quoted

52:26.644 --> 52:29.443
as saying about your music.

52:29.730 --> 52:33.701
The audience sitting
down is a weird trip.

52:36.862 --> 52:38.785
It's like separateness.

52:39.073 --> 52:42.043
But when they're dancing,
they're doing it with you,

52:42.326 --> 52:43.748
like you said it to them.

52:44.036 --> 52:49.509
And they've got it, and you
can play freer and freer.

52:49.792 --> 52:51.669
Would you care to
elaborate on that?

52:54.880 --> 52:56.928
It sounds different when
you say it,.

52:57.216 --> 52:59.890
It's sort of like
you as a performer

53:00.177 --> 53:03.681
will understand like an audience
communicating with a performer.

53:03.972 --> 53:06.395
Instead of one giving
and one receiving,

53:06.684 --> 53:08.106
it's, like, a reciprocal thing.

53:08.394 --> 53:10.372
When an audience is dancing,
they're communicating with you.

53:10.396 --> 53:11.790
And you know that
you're getting to them.

53:11.814 --> 53:13.454
And they're grooving,
and you're grooving.

53:13.524 --> 53:14.946
And it's sort of like feedback.

53:15.234 --> 53:16.628
Do you know what feedback
is in amplifiers?

53:16.652 --> 53:17.904
Yes.

53:18.195 --> 53:19.339
When you play the note
too loud, and the amplifier

53:19.363 --> 53:19.955
will play it back.

53:20.239 --> 53:21.616
And you play it back.

53:21.907 --> 53:22.926
And it goes around and back,
and it just makes everything

53:22.950 --> 53:24.327
go higher and higher.

53:24.618 --> 53:28.213
I see, well, that...
That clears it up for me.

53:32.042 --> 53:34.795
Dear family,
lots of trouble in the band,

53:35.087 --> 53:36.567
most of them revolving
around the fact

53:36.839 --> 53:38.591
that I think I'm hot
shit, as I'm told

53:38.882 --> 53:40.225
by everyone from Albert down.

53:40.509 --> 53:42.307
And the band is sloppy.

53:42.594 --> 53:44.267
When she came into
the band, Peter

53:44.555 --> 53:46.275
was the leader of the
band, the bass player,

53:46.390 --> 53:49.985
and James was the
mythic, iconic, you know,

53:50.269 --> 53:51.521
beautiful figure.

53:51.812 --> 53:53.280
He represented the band.

53:56.358 --> 53:57.405
And then here comes Janis.

53:57.693 --> 53:58.973
And when she joined
the band, she

53:59.027 --> 54:00.324
became both of those things.

54:00.612 --> 54:03.331
They had a very complicated
reaction to her fame.

54:09.747 --> 54:12.591
There was a cadre
of hangers that

54:12.875 --> 54:16.129
sort of insulated her from her
band, from what I could see.

54:16.420 --> 54:18.593
And it was just a matter
of time until somebody

54:18.881 --> 54:24.103
tried to polish her up and
make a big star out of her.

54:24.386 --> 54:27.310
It's crazy, now, to think back
at it that we signed, you know,

54:27.598 --> 54:28.998
a management agreement
with the guy.

54:29.266 --> 54:30.734
But I think from
the very get go,

54:31.018 --> 54:34.272
I think there was a sense that
he was not a big fan of ours,

54:34.563 --> 54:36.816
that he really was into Janis.

54:37.107 --> 54:42.534
But we wanted to believe that he
would work for the whole band.

54:42.821 --> 54:45.119
And the guys in the
band were powerless.

54:45.407 --> 54:48.456
No one had the ability to
stop that from happening.

54:48.744 --> 54:50.997
She was a singularity,
and she attracted

54:51.288 --> 54:52.288
that kind of attention.

54:54.792 --> 54:57.511
She cared about Big
Brother's career.

54:57.795 --> 55:00.765
She loved those guys, but
there was something that she

55:01.048 --> 55:04.769
saw that was beyond that.

55:05.052 --> 55:09.023
And if she didn't do it,
she'd never know if she could.

55:09.306 --> 55:11.900
Dear family,
so we're back in California

55:12.184 --> 55:13.936
for two more weeks.

55:14.228 --> 55:16.777
After that, begins
my hardest task.

55:17.064 --> 55:19.658
I told you, remember, that
I was leaving Big Brother

55:19.942 --> 55:21.865
and going to do a
thing on my own.

55:22.152 --> 55:24.433
There will be a whole lot of
pressure because of the vibes

55:24.655 --> 55:26.123
created by my
leaving Big Brother,

55:26.406 --> 55:28.204
and also just how big I am now.

55:35.040 --> 55:37.000
Nobody ever saw her wearing
those kind of clothes,

55:37.167 --> 55:38.510
but that's the
kind of clothes she

55:38.794 --> 55:40.421
had when she came for Texas.

55:40.712 --> 55:42.774
If someone said, well, what
did you learn from Janis?

55:42.798 --> 55:43.798
What did she teach you?

55:44.049 --> 55:45.801
If I had to say
it in a sentence,

55:46.093 --> 55:52.351
it's emotional honesty and the
price of not emotional honesty.

55:52.641 --> 55:54.063
She started to lose that.

55:54.351 --> 55:57.355
She started to become something
that people expected of her.

55:57.646 --> 55:59.523
She started to
become a caricature

55:59.815 --> 56:04.116
of what she was and play
it for people, you know?

56:04.403 --> 56:07.623
And I think that
hurt her in some way.

56:07.906 --> 56:11.331
Take this lonely heart
from one lonely girl.

56:11.618 --> 56:15.668
Reach in to high, babe, can't
help from getting burned.

56:15.956 --> 56:19.551
Everything she ever wrote
pretty much is autobiographical.

56:19.835 --> 56:21.475
And I thought the
reaching too high, babe,

56:21.503 --> 56:23.881
too, this is done
right at the time

56:24.172 --> 56:26.925
when she's leaving Big Brother.

56:27.217 --> 56:30.096
She knows she's kind of
going to go for some higher

56:30.387 --> 56:33.266
level of fame and
stardom and, you know,

56:33.557 --> 56:34.934
she might fall on her face.

56:35.225 --> 56:35.896
She knew that.

56:36.184 --> 56:37.184
It might not work out.

56:37.394 --> 56:38.394
She might get burned.

56:48.113 --> 56:51.663
The fallout for James
and Peter and David

56:51.950 --> 56:55.454
was significant because
Janis asked Sam to come

56:55.746 --> 56:57.168
with her to her new band.

57:00.500 --> 57:01.500
I loved Jan.

57:01.627 --> 57:02.907
I loved her all the way through.

57:03.045 --> 57:05.013
You know, the first
time I ever saw her,

57:05.297 --> 57:08.301
she just had this
attitude that I liked.

57:08.592 --> 57:11.220
It wasn't belligerent, but
it was non-compromising.

57:17.726 --> 57:18.773
She's loud.

57:19.061 --> 57:22.110
She's one of these
loud Texas women.

57:22.397 --> 57:27.403
She's real smart and
considerate most of the time.

57:27.694 --> 57:29.947
And we both had
real quick tempers.

57:46.713 --> 57:48.886
They called me up
to play with Janis,

57:49.174 --> 57:50.391
so they sent me a ticket.

57:50.676 --> 57:53.520
And I went to New York.

57:53.804 --> 57:55.602
And I went there, and
they opened the door.

57:55.889 --> 58:00.315
And this girl had on a
bra and some panties.

58:00.602 --> 58:02.400
She said, hi, I'm Janis.

58:02.688 --> 58:04.048
I said, hi, I'm in
the right place.

58:10.320 --> 58:12.573
And she started singing.

58:12.864 --> 58:14.707
I said, damn.

58:14.992 --> 58:15.992
Are you sure she's white?

58:19.746 --> 58:21.874
When you quit Big Brother
and the Holding Company,

58:22.165 --> 58:24.839
why did you do that?

58:25.127 --> 58:30.600
Well, just because it was
sort of just time for us,

58:30.882 --> 58:32.509
I think, to go on and
do something else.

58:32.801 --> 58:33.973
You know what I mean?

58:34.261 --> 58:38.232
Like, you grow together,
you know, a certain way,

58:38.515 --> 58:40.813
and you sort of
exhaust each other.

58:41.101 --> 58:43.141
You exhaust the good that
you can do for each other,

58:43.311 --> 58:45.313
and it was just
time for us to start

58:45.605 --> 58:47.528
growing in other directions.

58:47.816 --> 58:48.816
You know what I mean?

58:51.486 --> 58:53.339
You know, I think you
really grow as a musician.

58:53.363 --> 58:55.866
And that's what, after all,
we're supposed to be all about,

58:56.158 --> 58:58.078
is trying to get better
at what we do, you know'?

59:03.498 --> 59:05.216
San Francisco was
the first place,

59:05.500 --> 59:10.222
the first community, Where
Janis really felt at home.

59:10.505 --> 59:12.974
When she left Big
Brother, she lost it.

59:46.583 --> 59:48.677
The pressure to
succeed was huge,

59:48.960 --> 59:51.463
and she was carrying
around this weight.

01:00:00.555 --> 01:00:02.523
You know, she didn't
know how to lead a band.

01:00:02.808 --> 01:00:05.152
That's one of the
reasons it was a mistake.

01:00:05.435 --> 01:00:06.875
She didn't know how
to lead the band.

01:00:07.145 --> 01:00:10.240
And she was in charge, so she
had people putting together

01:00:10.524 --> 01:00:14.779
that band for her, along with a
lot of other strange people who

01:00:15.070 --> 01:00:16.788
were appointed band directors.

01:00:17.072 --> 01:00:19.325
It wasn't working.

01:00:22.369 --> 01:00:25.794
There were changes in
personnel, and none of it

01:00:26.081 --> 01:00:28.004
solved anything.

01:00:28.291 --> 01:00:33.092
We went to Europe only, like,
two months into touring.

01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:35.380
She's there with a new band
which doesn't know what

01:00:35.549 --> 01:00:38.428
the hell it's supposed to be.

01:00:38.718 --> 01:00:39.890
<i>OK, You GUYS-</i>

01:00:43.098 --> 01:00:45.021
You know what?

01:00:45.308 --> 01:00:48.357
I make it a policy.

01:00:48.645 --> 01:00:53.526
We played in Frankfurt,
and Janis was freaking out.

01:00:53.817 --> 01:00:56.445
We peeped out a curtain,
and all of these dudes

01:00:56.736 --> 01:00:59.660
were sitting there with
their little haircuts,

01:00:59.948 --> 01:01:04.579
like you put a bowl on their
head and cut around the bowl.

01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:05.917
(Is everybody read)”

01:01:06.204 --> 01:01:07.205
But we felt like playing.

01:01:07.497 --> 01:01:10.091
We said, hey, man,
we'll play the show.

01:01:10.375 --> 01:01:14.380
If y'all want to boogie, come
on up here with us and boogie.

01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:24.939
If there's something you need,

01:01:25.223 --> 01:01:29.444
hun, that you've never ever
had, I know you've never had it.

01:01:29.728 --> 01:01:32.447
Oh, honey, don't you
sit there crying.

01:01:32.731 --> 01:01:36.452
Don't just sit there
feeling bad, no, no, no.

01:01:36.735 --> 01:01:37.952
You better get up.

01:01:38.236 --> 01:01:39.453
Now, do you understand?

01:01:39.738 --> 01:01:40.955
Raise your hand.

01:01:41.239 --> 01:01:42.957
Hey, hey! hey.

01:01:43.241 --> 01:01:45.460
Raise your hand.

01:01:45.744 --> 01:01:47.667
Right here, right now.

01:01:47.954 --> 01:01:48.954
Hey.

01:01:52.125 --> 01:01:56.380
Whoa, oh, yeah.

01:02:15.273 --> 01:02:15.865
I'm nobody.

01:02:16.149 --> 01:02:17.401
I'm just a fan.

01:02:17.692 --> 01:02:19.410
No, I'm just a fan.

01:02:19.694 --> 01:02:21.367
I'm crazy about her.

01:02:21.655 --> 01:02:22.372
Where from you are friend?

01:02:22.656 --> 01:02:23.373
I can't talk.

01:02:23.657 --> 01:02:24.374
Quit taking pictures of me.

01:02:24.658 --> 01:02:25.875
Why not?

01:02:26.159 --> 01:02:27.159
Because I'm not groovy.

01:02:27.369 --> 01:02:27.870
She's groovy.

01:02:28.161 --> 01:02:29.161
Look at her.

01:02:34.542 --> 01:02:37.921
I guess because we're
strangers in foreign lands,

01:02:38.213 --> 01:02:39.931
the Cosmic Blues
Band came together.

01:02:43.343 --> 01:02:47.018
The Albert Hall in London
was the last concert,

01:02:47.305 --> 01:02:50.525
and Janis knew that
Bob Dylan had sold out.

01:02:50.809 --> 01:02:53.733
And she was really excited
about playing the Albert Hall,

01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:55.863
and she did sell out.

01:02:56.147 --> 01:02:58.525
She got people dancing in the
aisles at the Albert Hall,

01:02:58.817 --> 01:03:01.320
and she was just ecstatic after.

01:03:01.611 --> 01:03:04.660
Excited,
woo, nobody ever-nobody,

01:03:04.948 --> 01:03:07.121
anybody, ever thought
it would be that good.

01:03:07.409 --> 01:03:08.786
Nobody's ever
fucking got up yet.

01:03:09.077 --> 01:03:11.000
No one's ever got up
and danced and dug it.

01:03:11.288 --> 01:03:14.007
No one's ever done anything
there, and they did it, man.

01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:16.419
They fucking got up and grooved.

01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:18.804
Then they listened.

01:03:19.087 --> 01:03:20.714
<i>God, I'm so happy, woo-hoe.</i>

01:03:33.143 --> 01:03:35.942
When Janis was on stage
and things were going well,

01:03:36.229 --> 01:03:37.389
all was right with the world.

01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:43.745
But after that hour, you've
got to come off stage.

01:03:52.203 --> 01:03:54.877
She used to say that
it was like making love,

01:03:55.165 --> 01:03:59.261
being on the stage, you
know, but it's an illusion.

01:03:59.544 --> 01:04:02.172
When the show's over,
the audience leaves,

01:04:02.464 --> 01:04:03.664
and you're left with yourself.

01:04:16.394 --> 01:04:21.241
She rarely was using
heroin before a concert

01:04:21.524 --> 01:04:24.653
because it wasn't the right
kind of energy for onstage,

01:04:24.944 --> 01:04:26.446
and she cared about that.

01:04:26.738 --> 01:04:30.208
But her after-the-concert
fix was a real regular thing.

01:04:33.119 --> 01:04:35.167
We were devolving into this drug

01:04:35.455 --> 01:04:37.503
use that was way out of hand.

01:04:37.791 --> 01:04:41.011
I have to, you know,
digress for a second say,

01:04:41.294 --> 01:04:44.548
when Janis was in Big Brother,
Peter didn't do any drugs.

01:04:44.839 --> 01:04:46.637
You know, so out
of respect to him,

01:04:46.925 --> 01:04:50.975
we kept it toned down a lot.

01:04:51.262 --> 01:04:54.061
So now she's in Cosmic
Blues so we're doing really

01:04:54.349 --> 01:04:56.397
a lot of drugs, you know,
because Peter's not-...

01:04:56.684 --> 01:04:58.231
Daddy isn't there anymore.

01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:00.864
We're free, and we can
do all these drugs now.

01:05:03.983 --> 01:05:05.781
So it really got out of hand.

01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:09.744
In Los Angeles, in particular,
at the Landmark Hotel,

01:05:10.031 --> 01:05:11.283
she called me to her room.

01:05:11.574 --> 01:05:15.249
And she said, your services
are no longer needed.

01:05:15.537 --> 01:05:17.457
And so then we shot up
some heroin, and she said,

01:05:17.622 --> 01:05:19.169
well, aren't you
going to ask me why?

01:05:21.835 --> 01:05:23.929
I said what difference
does it make?

01:05:24.212 --> 01:05:27.386
It was just like a marriage, you
know, it had run out of juice.

01:05:27.674 --> 01:05:32.896
And a lot of our friends
were dying that year.

01:05:33.179 --> 01:05:35.307
She's lying on a motel
bed, and she says,

01:05:35.598 --> 01:05:37.646
it's not going to happen to me.

01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:39.777
She said, my people
are pioneer stock,

01:05:40.061 --> 01:05:41.741
you know, and they came
across the country.

01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:42.980
And they came to Texas.

01:05:43.022 --> 01:05:44.069
They're tough.

01:05:44.357 --> 01:05:45.779
I've got those
genes, and nothing's

01:05:46.067 --> 01:05:47.319
going to happen to me.

01:05:47.610 --> 01:05:49.988
And I said, shit, I wish
you wouldn't have said that.

01:06:45.877 --> 01:06:48.756
We had heard about Woodstock
from pretty well in advance.

01:06:49.047 --> 01:06:50.264
And we thought, oh, great.

01:06:50.548 --> 01:06:53.301
It's the next Monterey.

01:06:53.593 --> 01:06:59.350
It's a very warm summer day,
and all this variety of choppers

01:06:59.641 --> 01:07:00.721
are taking off and landing.

01:07:03.561 --> 01:07:07.566
I do remember that Peggy
was on the airlift zone

01:07:07.857 --> 01:07:10.701
where we took off from.

01:07:10.985 --> 01:07:14.910
I was always apprehensive when
Peggy was around because I felt

01:07:15.198 --> 01:07:18.077
that she would be an enabler,
rather than a helper,

01:07:18.368 --> 01:07:19.711
with the drug problem.

01:07:24.457 --> 01:07:28.553
She called and
said, you have to come.

01:07:28.836 --> 01:07:31.840
I said, I can't, because
we were hearing reports

01:07:32.131 --> 01:07:34.054
that the turnpike
was bogged down.

01:07:34.342 --> 01:07:36.265
And people were out of
gas and having babies,

01:07:36.553 --> 01:07:40.603
and, you know, it was like
locusts coming through.

01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:43.018
And so I said the
only way I'd come out

01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:45.152
there is if I was airlifted in.

01:07:45.436 --> 01:07:46.436
And she said, OK.

01:08:06.457 --> 01:08:11.054
We were both around the
same age in the South

01:08:11.337 --> 01:08:13.180
with middle-class families.

01:08:13.464 --> 01:08:18.970
But I think Janis had a
harder time of coming through.

01:08:19.261 --> 01:08:22.140
But on the other hand, you know,
people tend to take because

01:08:22.432 --> 01:08:25.276
of that she was depressed.

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:27.312
She wasn't.

01:08:27.604 --> 01:08:29.948
It was all fun.

01:08:30.231 --> 01:08:34.611
We shot heroin for fun,
and it took the edge off.

01:08:34.902 --> 01:08:37.404
We were in the midst
of one of the most

01:08:37.697 --> 01:08:39.243
social phenomenons in history.

01:08:44.328 --> 01:08:45.956
What I understand
is she got very

01:08:46.247 --> 01:08:52.845
high shooting up in the
portisan and couldn't go on.

01:08:53.129 --> 01:08:55.678
Finally, Peggy and John Cooke
had to push her onstage.

01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:11.234
How are y'all... how... I mean,
um, how are you out there?

01:09:11.522 --> 01:09:12.023
Are you mellow?

01:09:12.314 --> 01:09:13.314
Are you OK?

01:09:17.194 --> 01:09:19.448
You're not, uh, are
you staying stoned?

01:09:19.738 --> 01:09:21.741
And you've got enough water,
and you've got a place

01:09:22.033 --> 01:09:23.205
to sleep and everything?

01:09:27.246 --> 01:09:30.295
Because, you know, because we
ought to all of us, you know,

01:09:30.582 --> 01:09:32.176
I don't mean to be preachy.

01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:35.087
But we ought to remember... and
that means promoters, too...

01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:37.474
That music's for grooving, man.

01:09:37.756 --> 01:09:40.260
And music's not for putting
yourself through bad changes.

01:09:40.551 --> 01:09:43.020
You know, I mean, you don't
have to take anybody's shit,

01:09:43.304 --> 01:09:44.805
man, just to like music.

01:09:45.098 --> 01:09:45.644
You know what I mean?

01:09:45.932 --> 01:09:47.149
You don't.

01:09:47.433 --> 01:09:50.482
So if you're getting more
shit than you deserve,

01:09:50.770 --> 01:09:53.990
you know what to
do about it, man.

01:09:57.735 --> 01:09:58.952
Work me, lord.

01:10:06.077 --> 01:10:09.581
Work me, lord.

01:10:09.872 --> 01:10:14.093
Please, don't you leave me.

01:10:14.377 --> 01:10:22.353
I feel so useless down
here with no one to love,

01:10:22.635 --> 01:10:26.105
though I've looked everywhere.

01:10:26.389 --> 01:10:32.487
And I can't find me anybody
to love, to feel my care.

01:10:32.770 --> 01:10:40.770
So work me.

01:10:41.404 --> 01:10:48.913
Whoa, oh, use me, lord.

01:10:49.203 --> 01:10:50.483
Did you ever have a whole night,

01:10:50.538 --> 01:10:51.932
though, you just stand
up there and feel

01:10:51.956 --> 01:10:53.833
like you're not making it?

01:10:54.125 --> 01:10:56.753
Well, yeah, but you
kind of try and... you

01:10:57.044 --> 01:10:58.522
have little games that
you play with yourself

01:10:58.546 --> 01:10:59.718
to turn yourself on.

01:11:00.006 --> 01:11:01.883
You can usually
get yourself going.

01:11:02.175 --> 01:11:04.849
You never had a desire to
just leave the stage and say,

01:11:05.136 --> 01:11:07.230
I'm sorry, it isn't
working tonight, folks?

01:11:07.513 --> 01:11:09.073
It's the best thing
ever happened to me.

01:11:09.265 --> 01:11:10.357
I wouldn't leave.

01:11:10.641 --> 01:11:13.315
Yeah, yeah, if you
couldn't do it anymore,

01:11:13.603 --> 01:11:15.947
you'd be miserable, huh?

01:11:16.230 --> 01:11:18.198
Yeah, I hope that by
that time, I'll have

01:11:18.483 --> 01:11:19.643
something else that's groovy.

01:11:22.153 --> 01:11:27.153
Whoa, whoa, please, oh, no, no,

01:11:35.833 --> 01:11:40.509
no, no, no, please...
Ah, oh, no, no,

01:11:40.797 --> 01:11:42.219
no, don't you go and leave me.

01:11:42.507 --> 01:11:44.305
Honey, when I reach
you, I want to,

01:11:44.592 --> 01:11:48.972
I said I want to hold on to you.

01:11:49.263 --> 01:11:51.516
Well, you're never there.

01:11:51.808 --> 01:11:53.276
It doesn't turn me off, man.

01:11:53.559 --> 01:11:58.190
I still reach out to
hold onto my man.

01:11:58.481 --> 01:12:03.738
I said, daddy, daddy, daddy,
daddy, daddy, don't you go.

01:12:04.028 --> 01:12:09.028
No, no, no, no, honey, don't
you go and leave some love.

01:13:07.133 --> 01:13:11.809
This is the dark time
in my time with Janis.

01:13:12.096 --> 01:13:13.689
Albert and Janis
reached a point where

01:13:13.973 --> 01:13:17.352
they said, well, we're
going to let the Cosmic

01:13:17.643 --> 01:13:19.145
Blues Band dissipate.

01:13:23.149 --> 01:13:25.868
Janis took that
failure on herself.

01:13:26.152 --> 01:13:28.075
She felt that she was failing.

01:13:28.362 --> 01:13:30.364
And this was, as
a result, by far,

01:13:30.656 --> 01:13:33.034
their worst abuse of
heroin and alcohol.

01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:44.220
Well, this whole thing that's
happened to me, you see,

01:13:44.503 --> 01:13:49.805
this whole success
thing, uh, it hasn't yet

01:13:50.092 --> 01:13:52.265
really compromised
the position that I

01:13:52.553 --> 01:13:53.753
took a long time ago in Texas.

01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:56.024
That was to be true
to myself, to be

01:13:56.307 --> 01:13:59.151
the person that was
on the inside of me

01:13:59.435 --> 01:14:00.903
and not play games.

01:14:01.187 --> 01:14:04.361
And so that's What I'm trying
to do mostly in the whole world,

01:14:04.649 --> 01:14:05.901
is to not bullshit myself.

01:14:08.694 --> 01:14:10.822
When I saw her in the hotel, all

01:14:11.113 --> 01:14:12.831
of the uncertainties
and the little girl

01:14:13.115 --> 01:14:15.117
lost were very visible.

01:14:15.409 --> 01:14:18.128
And she said, come
on up, and we'll

01:14:18.412 --> 01:14:20.005
order drinks from room service.

01:14:20.289 --> 01:14:23.338
And I hadn't been
there very long

01:14:23.626 --> 01:14:24.843
when she decided to shoot up.

01:14:25.127 --> 01:14:27.676
And I'd never seen
her do that before.

01:14:27.964 --> 01:14:30.092
And then we had some drinks.

01:14:30.383 --> 01:14:34.388
We talked, and she did
it again before I left.

01:14:34.679 --> 01:14:37.649
When I left, I thought,
I don't know if I

01:14:37.932 --> 01:14:39.354
will want to see her again.

01:14:44.563 --> 01:14:46.043
What do you think
when you're singing?

01:14:46.315 --> 01:14:47.793
Are you actually thinking
what's going on in the song,

01:14:47.817 --> 01:14:50.570
or can your mind
be somewhere else?

01:14:50.861 --> 01:14:51.880
I'm not really thinking much.

01:14:51.904 --> 01:14:54.077
You just sort of try and feel.

01:14:56.951 --> 01:15:00.501
When last I heard of you, you
were in the jungles of Brazil.

01:15:00.788 --> 01:15:03.587
I went to Rio for a
carnival, and then I

01:15:03.874 --> 01:15:07.674
decided to hitchhike around
the northern part of Brazil.

01:15:07.962 --> 01:15:09.054
As a kind of vacation?

01:15:09.338 --> 01:15:11.058
Just like a regular
old beatnik on the road.

01:15:20.099 --> 01:15:22.568
I knew I was going to try to
make it to Rio for carnivals

01:15:22.852 --> 01:15:24.329
because I was meeting
a friend of mine.

01:15:24.353 --> 01:15:27.232
So I got to Rio a
couple days early.

01:15:27.523 --> 01:15:30.948
And I thought, God,
there's Ipanema Beach,

01:15:31.235 --> 01:15:32.908
the girl from Ipanema you know?

01:15:33.195 --> 01:15:37.200
So I went over to Ipanema Beach
and the very first person I ran

01:15:37.491 --> 01:15:40.165
into on the beach was Janis.

01:15:40.453 --> 01:15:41.750
So I didn't know it was Janis.

01:15:42.038 --> 01:15:43.961
I just saw this girl
with a bikini on.

01:15:58.971 --> 01:16:00.348
She looked up.

01:16:00.639 --> 01:16:02.576
I remember her lifting her
sunglasses up and saying,

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:04.523
hi, you cute thing.

01:16:04.810 --> 01:16:07.279
And I went, wow,
I, a cute thing.

01:16:07.563 --> 01:16:09.003
I had been in the
jungle a long time.

01:16:28.167 --> 01:16:30.716
When we went back to the
hotel the first night,

01:16:31.003 --> 01:16:32.003
she wasn't sleeping well.

01:16:32.171 --> 01:16:32.763
She was rolling around.

01:16:33.047 --> 01:16:33.764
She was unhappy.

01:16:34.048 --> 01:16:35.550
She was having cold sweats.

01:16:35.841 --> 01:16:38.435
And she told me that she was
trying to kick the habit.

01:16:38.719 --> 01:16:41.142
So I held her for two and a
half days while she came down.

01:16:46.685 --> 01:16:48.733
She was really a
different person.

01:16:49.021 --> 01:16:50.819
She was much more calm.

01:16:51.107 --> 01:16:53.610
She was much more beautiful.

01:16:53.901 --> 01:16:55.781
You know, and she wasn't
used to being straight,

01:16:55.820 --> 01:16:58.289
so she knew she
was more beautiful.

01:16:58.572 --> 01:17:00.540
And then after that,
everything was clear.

01:17:00.825 --> 01:17:05.126
She couldn't have gotten higher
when we traveled around Brazil.

01:17:05.412 --> 01:17:08.006
She was so free and so
different than any other girl

01:17:08.290 --> 01:17:09.290
I'd ever met.

01:17:11.877 --> 01:17:15.256
I never had a woman inspire
me before, so it stopped

01:17:15.548 --> 01:17:16.668
me in my track, so to speak.

01:17:16.924 --> 01:17:19.427
I was heading for North Africa.

01:17:19.718 --> 01:17:22.118
And when I met her, I realized,
shit, I'm not going anywhere.

01:17:25.683 --> 01:17:29.438
When we came back to
California, we more spent time

01:17:29.728 --> 01:17:31.947
together just the two of us.

01:17:32.231 --> 01:17:33.671
I mean, we did come
to the park here,

01:17:33.858 --> 01:17:35.075
and we did go to.

01:17:35.359 --> 01:17:37.239
But basically, we just
pretty much fun together.

01:17:37.444 --> 01:17:39.617
We were inseparable,
really, for those months.

01:17:43.701 --> 01:17:46.124
As my relationship
with Janis grew,

01:17:46.412 --> 01:17:48.835
I realized that when she
sang me all these songs,

01:17:49.123 --> 01:17:51.217
they were always the blues.

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:53.969
And that's what she felt,
basically, were the blues.

01:17:54.253 --> 01:17:56.722
She could feel everybody's pain.

01:17:57.006 --> 01:17:58.349
That's one of the
reasons she did

01:17:58.632 --> 01:18:01.135
heroin was so she didn't
have to be involved

01:18:01.427 --> 01:18:03.225
with everybody else's life.

01:18:03.512 --> 01:18:06.186
Most people can be oblivious
to what's going on around them,

01:18:06.473 --> 01:18:07.473
but Janis couldn't.

01:18:07.558 --> 01:18:10.107
She couldn't block it out.

01:18:10.394 --> 01:18:12.988
But she was addicted to it, you
know, and I got her to stop.

01:18:13.272 --> 01:18:15.821
And then when I would
go away, she'd get weak,

01:18:16.108 --> 01:18:20.579
I guess is one way to say
it, and start it again.

01:18:20.863 --> 01:18:22.865
I told her I can't do that part.

01:18:23.157 --> 01:18:25.117
I can't put up with that
because it's killing you.

01:18:25.284 --> 01:18:26.444
And it broke my heart to see.

01:18:26.493 --> 01:18:27.494
That's really what it is.

01:18:27.786 --> 01:18:30.289
It broke my heart
more than anything.

01:18:30.581 --> 01:18:31.981
When I said I was
leaving, she said,

01:18:32.166 --> 01:18:34.510
why don't you stay
and become my manager?

01:18:34.793 --> 01:18:39.264
And it was a tempting offer,
but the heroin I couldn't even

01:18:39.548 --> 01:18:40.548
begin to put up with.

01:18:51.602 --> 01:18:59.602
Baby, yeah, baby, well, baby,

01:19:01.111 --> 01:19:05.287
oh, honey, welcome back home.

01:19:05.574 --> 01:19:07.292
I had a man.

01:19:10.955 --> 01:19:16.553
He said, honey, honey,
you know that I love you.

01:19:16.835 --> 01:19:18.337
See, but I gotta go find myself.

01:19:18.629 --> 01:19:21.098
You know, I gotta
go and find my life.

01:19:21.382 --> 01:19:26.309
I gotta go find myself over in
Africa or over in, uh, New York

01:19:26.595 --> 01:19:30.850
City or over in, uh,
, some place

01:19:31.141 --> 01:19:32.661
those cats are always
wandering off to.

01:19:32.851 --> 01:19:35.445
I never figured out
exactly where it was.

01:19:35.729 --> 01:19:37.129
They're always going
somewhere, man.

01:19:40.526 --> 01:19:42.654
And I said, baby,
don't you realize?

01:19:45.781 --> 01:19:48.079
You're looking for your
life over there, honey.

01:19:48.367 --> 01:19:49.869
Well, you know
where your life is?

01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:52.288
You're life's waiting
like a God-damned fool

01:19:52.579 --> 01:19:55.583
right here for you, man.

01:19:55.874 --> 01:19:59.253
And one morning, you're gonna
wake up in, uh, Casablanca,

01:19:59.545 --> 01:20:01.013
one of those fancy places.

01:20:01.297 --> 01:20:03.925
Honey, you're gonna be
freezing to death, man.

01:20:04.216 --> 01:20:07.220
You're gonna wake up and
you'll say, good, good lord,

01:20:07.511 --> 01:20:10.560
good, good, good lord.

01:20:10.848 --> 01:20:12.316
I just went off
and left that woman

01:20:12.599 --> 01:20:15.603
in that great big huge double
bed with that great big fur rug

01:20:15.894 --> 01:20:18.192
on top of it and those
satin sheets, man.

01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:21.609
What am I doing in
Casablanca, man?

01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:23.277
I mean, really, man.

01:20:23.569 --> 01:20:24.963
One of these days, that
cat's going to wake

01:20:24.987 --> 01:20:26.409
up and say that to himself.

01:20:26.697 --> 01:20:31.544
And when he comes back home,
there, just like the Capricorn

01:20:31.827 --> 01:20:34.546
that I am, I'll be
standing there waiting.

01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:38.630
I said, baby, I
knew one day, hun,

01:20:38.917 --> 01:20:42.717
I knew, knew, knew one day.

01:20:43.005 --> 01:20:45.758
'Cause you've finally
come on home to me.

01:20:46.050 --> 01:20:49.805
Honey, when you walk
in my front door,

01:20:50.095 --> 01:20:52.769
I'm gonna be able to tell
by the look in your eyes.

01:20:53.057 --> 01:20:57.107
I'll say, good God, that
man finally done got it.

01:20:57.394 --> 01:21:01.570
Lord, that man
finally done realized.

01:21:01.857 --> 01:21:04.576
So you can put your
head on my shoulder,

01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:09.991
baby, yeah, 'cause I know you've
got some more tears to shed.

01:21:10.282 --> 01:21:11.499
So come on.

01:21:11.784 --> 01:21:12.501
Come on.

01:21:12.785 --> 01:21:13.502
Come on.

01:21:13.786 --> 01:21:14.503
Come on.

01:21:14.787 --> 01:21:15.504
Come on.

01:21:15.788 --> 01:21:20.885
Come on and cry, cry, baby.

01:21:21.168 --> 01:21:25.093
Cry, baby.

01:21:25.381 --> 01:21:26.381
Cry.

01:21:29.259 --> 01:21:30.259
Cry.

01:21:34.014 --> 01:21:41.273
Oh, baby, cry, baby-

01:21:41.563 --> 01:21:42.735
Cry, baby.

01:21:54.993 --> 01:21:57.337
Hey, I want to ask about
that tune that you just sang.

01:21:57.621 --> 01:22:01.626
It's, um, it's about men.

01:22:01.917 --> 01:22:02.917
It's about men?

01:22:03.085 --> 01:22:05.554
Did you ever see
those mule carts'?

01:22:05.838 --> 01:22:06.885
Yeah.

01:22:07.172 --> 01:22:08.692
They, uh, there's a
dumb mule up there,

01:22:08.882 --> 01:22:12.136
right, and a long stick
with a string and a carrot

01:22:12.428 --> 01:22:13.805
hanging out of it.

01:22:14.096 --> 01:22:16.199
And they hang this thing out
in front of the mule's nose,

01:22:16.223 --> 01:22:19.693
and he runs after
it all day long.

01:22:19.977 --> 01:22:23.356
And who is the man in this
parable, the mule or the person

01:22:23.647 --> 01:22:24.647
holding the carrot?

01:22:24.898 --> 01:22:27.993
The woman is the
mule, chasing something

01:22:28.277 --> 01:22:29.517
that somebody's always teasing.

01:22:29.695 --> 01:22:32.824
Constantly chasing a man
who always eludes here.

01:22:33.115 --> 01:22:34.843
Well, they just always
hold up something more

01:22:34.867 --> 01:22:36.067
than they're prepared to give.

01:22:38.579 --> 01:22:41.924
We had dinner one night, and
I remember suddenly saying,

01:22:42.207 --> 01:22:46.883
not having planned to,
how-— can you assure me

01:22:47.171 --> 01:22:52.268
that you're not doing heroin?

01:22:52.551 --> 01:22:53.894
And her answer was interesting.

01:22:54.178 --> 01:22:57.227
It was, who would care?

01:22:57.514 --> 01:22:58.514
It really stopped me.

01:23:04.771 --> 01:23:06.773
Do you ever get back
to Port Arthur, Texas?

01:23:07.065 --> 01:23:09.568
No, but I'm back in August, man.

01:23:09.860 --> 01:23:10.860
And guess what I'm doing?

01:23:10.903 --> 01:23:12.155
I don't know, night clubbing?

01:23:12.446 --> 01:23:14.366
I'm going to my tenth
annual high school reunion.

01:23:19.036 --> 01:23:21.116
Oh, I want to... take movies
and bring them back here

01:23:21.205 --> 01:23:22.205
and show us.

01:23:22.414 --> 01:23:23.558
Hey, would you
like to go with me?

01:23:23.582 --> 01:23:24.299
Well, I don't have
that many friends

01:23:24.583 --> 01:23:25.709
in your high school class.

01:23:26.001 --> 01:23:27.562
- I don't, either.
- Or mine, for that matter.

01:23:27.586 --> 01:23:28.087
I don't either.
Believe me.

01:23:28.378 --> 01:23:29.470
You don't, either?

01:23:29.755 --> 01:23:31.515
How do you know they
won't move the reunion'?

01:23:31.548 --> 01:23:32.265
That's true.

01:23:32.549 --> 01:23:33.669
I wasn't going to tell them.

01:23:39.264 --> 01:23:40.984
What do you remember
most about Port Arthur?

01:23:45.145 --> 01:23:48.820
Uh, I don't really...
Uh, no comment.

01:23:52.444 --> 01:23:55.368
Because it was really only
the acceptance of millions

01:23:55.656 --> 01:24:00.583
that could make up for that
way that she had grown up.

01:24:00.869 --> 01:24:03.213
If everyone loved
her, then it was OK.

01:24:03.497 --> 01:24:08.003
But if anyone didn't, they
could destroy her in a minute.

01:24:08.293 --> 01:24:10.512
Hi, how were you different
from your schoolmates

01:24:10.796 --> 01:24:12.389
when you were in DJ?

01:24:12.673 --> 01:24:13.265
I don't know.

01:24:13.549 --> 01:24:14.549
Why don't you ask them?

01:24:17.844 --> 01:24:18.845
I wonder.

01:24:19.137 --> 01:24:20.514
I was they who
made you different?

01:24:20.806 --> 01:24:21.932
No, I was...

01:24:22.224 --> 01:24:23.368
In other words, you were
different in comparison

01:24:23.392 --> 01:24:23.893
to them.

01:24:24.184 --> 01:24:25.857
Why Were you?

01:24:26.144 --> 01:24:28.272
I felt apart from them.

01:24:28.564 --> 01:24:31.238
Did you go to football games?

01:24:31.525 --> 01:24:33.698
I don't remember.

01:24:33.986 --> 01:24:38.116
Uh, I don't remember.

01:24:38.407 --> 01:24:39.909
I think not.

01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:42.294
I didn't go to the
high school prom.

01:24:45.163 --> 01:24:46.460
Aw, you were asked, weren't you?

01:24:46.748 --> 01:24:48.796
No, I wasn't.

01:24:49.084 --> 01:24:52.008
They didn't think... I don't
think they wanted to take me.

01:24:55.382 --> 01:24:59.637
And I've been... I've been
suffering ever since.

01:24:59.928 --> 01:25:04.604
I remember when I was young,
some doctor told my mother

01:25:04.891 --> 01:25:08.361
that if I didn't, quote,
"straighten up," quote,

01:25:08.645 --> 01:25:12.070
I was going to end up either
in jail or an insane asylum

01:25:12.357 --> 01:25:14.906
by the time I was 21.

01:25:15.193 --> 01:25:17.241
So when I turned 25 and
my second record came out,

01:25:17.529 --> 01:25:19.529
I think my mother sent me
a congratulatory telegram

01:25:19.573 --> 01:25:24.044
or something, you know,
that I had escaped the pen.

01:25:24.328 --> 01:25:25.955
How do you get along
with your parents?

01:25:26.246 --> 01:25:27.246
Pretty good.

01:25:27.497 --> 01:25:28.589
They had somewhere to go.

01:25:28.874 --> 01:25:30.421
Right, they went to a wedding.

01:25:30.709 --> 01:25:34.384
We go along pretty good, yeah.

01:25:34.671 --> 01:25:37.595
Did they ever seem
surprised by your success?

01:25:37.883 --> 01:25:40.011
I think, yeah, yeah.

01:25:40.302 --> 01:25:44.307
Our parents saw it was
challenging to their way

01:25:44.598 --> 01:25:47.226
of life, to their
positions in the community,

01:25:47.517 --> 01:25:52.614
and it created difficulties
between them and both of them

01:25:52.898 --> 01:25:55.492
silently with each
other, feeling that they

01:25:55.776 --> 01:25:59.781
had somehow caused a calamity.

01:26:24.513 --> 01:26:26.015
I didn't see her for six months.

01:26:26.306 --> 01:26:30.482
She had promised me that she
was going to quit heroin,

01:26:30.769 --> 01:26:31.770
and she did.

01:26:32.062 --> 01:26:33.188
And it changed her.

01:26:36.733 --> 01:26:38.531
Dear family, things

01:26:38.819 --> 01:26:40.571
are going so well for me.

01:26:40.862 --> 01:26:44.207
I have a new, smaller band, and
it's really going fantastic.

01:26:44.491 --> 01:26:47.085
I met a really fine man in Rio,
but I had to get back to work.

01:26:47.369 --> 01:26:49.747
So he's off finding
the rest of the world,

01:26:50.038 --> 01:26:53.042
but he really did love
me and was so good to me.

01:26:53.333 --> 01:26:55.210
He wants to come
back and marry me.

01:26:55.502 --> 01:26:58.221
I thought I'd die without
someone besides fans asking me,

01:26:58.505 --> 01:26:59.006
but he meant it.

01:26:59.297 --> 01:27:00.297
And who knows?

01:27:00.507 --> 01:27:01.651
I may get tired
of the music biz,

01:27:01.675 --> 01:27:03.177
but I'm really
getting it on now.

01:27:08.598 --> 01:27:11.147
She called me up and said,
I've got a great new band.

01:27:11.435 --> 01:27:14.405
Do you want to come
back on the road?

01:27:14.688 --> 01:27:16.110
With Janis, it was magic.

01:27:16.398 --> 01:27:19.993
She had a gift from
God when she played.

01:27:20.277 --> 01:27:22.077
There was a connection
there that I don't even

01:27:22.154 --> 01:27:24.031
know what it was between us.

01:27:24.322 --> 01:27:25.762
Somehow, we didn't
really do a lot...

01:27:25.949 --> 01:27:27.149
We never did a lot of talking.

01:27:29.745 --> 01:27:31.497
She was bubbly person.

01:27:31.788 --> 01:27:34.132
She wanted everything to
be so perfect for everyone,

01:27:34.416 --> 01:27:36.043
not just her, everyone.

01:27:36.334 --> 01:27:39.884
You say that it's over, baby.

01:27:40.172 --> 01:27:43.301
You say that it's over, dear.

01:27:43.592 --> 01:27:44.718
But still you hang around.

01:27:45.010 --> 01:27:46.808
She said, man, with Full Tilt, I

01:27:47.095 --> 01:27:48.938
can change something in
the middle of a song,

01:27:49.222 --> 01:27:52.146
and they're right there.

01:27:52.434 --> 01:27:56.234
She was a fantastic
front person.

01:27:56.521 --> 01:28:00.742
She would say, when I do the
windmill, keep her going.

01:28:01.026 --> 01:28:03.266
Or we'd be playing a song,
and she would decide she would

01:28:03.445 --> 01:28:05.447
like to talk to the audience.

01:28:05.739 --> 01:28:08.333
And she would bring
the band down,

01:28:08.617 --> 01:28:10.369
and then she would
start talking.

01:28:10.660 --> 01:28:11.660
I can't hear ya.

01:28:17.626 --> 01:28:19.173
She was working the crowd.

01:28:23.298 --> 01:28:25.096
It wasn't just
that she was clean.

01:28:25.383 --> 01:28:28.853
She had learned just
about every lesson

01:28:29.137 --> 01:28:34.109
to be learned from the really
tough times of the year before.

01:28:34.392 --> 01:28:36.736
She was more comfortable
about her whole life.

01:28:39.606 --> 01:28:43.236
Having David leave her was
actually really good for her.

01:28:43.527 --> 01:28:46.622
She spoke of him afterwards
as her lost love,

01:28:46.905 --> 01:28:48.185
and she still
hoped that he would

01:28:48.448 --> 01:28:50.121
come back after she got clean.

01:28:58.542 --> 01:29:03.218
Hey, make up your mind, honey.

01:29:03.505 --> 01:29:06.133
You're playing with me.

01:29:06.424 --> 01:29:08.267
David, honey, daddy, listen.

01:29:08.552 --> 01:29:10.930
I kicked, man, four months ago.

01:29:11.221 --> 01:29:14.896
I'm on the road rocking with a
great group, so get Janis back.

01:29:15.183 --> 01:29:18.027
She's delightfully crazy,
but I love her, man.

01:29:18.311 --> 01:29:19.871
I've got that picture
of us in Salvador,

01:29:20.063 --> 01:29:21.565
and every time I
look at it, I look

01:29:21.857 --> 01:29:23.951
like a woman, not a pop star.

01:29:24.234 --> 01:29:25.781
But I'm afraid it's too late.

01:29:26.069 --> 01:29:29.164
I know how to be a pop star, but
I don't know how to bake bread.

01:29:29.447 --> 01:29:32.417
But, honey, when I look at you,
this whole flood comes over me.

01:29:32.701 --> 01:29:34.578
I love you, and I did
write, mother fucker.

01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:36.087
Don't you yell at me.

01:30:01.479 --> 01:30:04.858
It seems to bother a
lot of women's lib people

01:30:05.150 --> 01:30:09.200
that you are kind of
so up front sexually.

01:30:09.487 --> 01:30:10.967
I haven't
been attacked by anyone yet.

01:30:11.239 --> 01:30:12.661
You know, how can
they attack me?

01:30:12.949 --> 01:30:16.169
I'm representing everything
they said they want, you know?

01:30:16.453 --> 01:30:19.548
It's sort of like you
are what you settle for.

01:30:19.831 --> 01:30:21.299
Do you know what I mean?

01:30:21.583 --> 01:30:23.256
You are only as much
as you settle for.

01:30:23.543 --> 01:30:26.342
And, you know, if they
settle for being somebody's

01:30:26.630 --> 01:30:28.553
dishwasher, that's their
own fucking problem.

01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:30.888
If you don't settle
for that, and you

01:30:31.176 --> 01:30:34.726
keep fighting, you know, you
end up anything you want to be.

01:30:35.013 --> 01:30:39.393
I'm just doing what I want
to and what feels right

01:30:39.684 --> 01:30:41.732
and not settling for
bullshit, and it works.

01:30:42.020 --> 01:30:43.488
How can they be mad at that?

01:30:43.772 --> 01:30:46.092
Yeah, one girl I know said,
well, how come she doesn't have

01:30:46.274 --> 01:30:48.902
any women in any of her groups?

01:30:49.194 --> 01:30:51.663
You show me a
good drummer, and I'll hire one.

01:30:51.947 --> 01:30:54.200
You know, show me a good chick.

01:30:54.491 --> 01:30:56.260
Besides, I don't want any
chicks on the road with me.

01:30:56.284 --> 01:30:57.410
You don't?

01:30:57.702 --> 01:31:00.501
I've got
enough competition, man.

01:31:00.789 --> 01:31:02.666
No, I like to be around men.

01:31:08.046 --> 01:31:09.047
God bless ya, folks.

01:31:09.339 --> 01:31:12.263
God bless ya.

01:31:12.550 --> 01:31:14.803
It was fun getting
back together with her

01:31:15.095 --> 01:31:18.019
on the Festival
Express because we were

01:31:18.306 --> 01:31:21.150
all stuck in a little area.

01:31:21.434 --> 01:31:24.358
Her yes men couldn't
contain her there.

01:31:24.646 --> 01:31:27.570
They couldn't control
her there because she

01:31:27.857 --> 01:31:29.817
wanted to get out and be
with her kindred spirits,

01:31:29.943 --> 01:31:30.944
the musicians.

01:31:31.236 --> 01:31:32.328
Are we in Calgary yet?

01:31:32.612 --> 01:31:33.204
We're stopped.

01:31:33.488 --> 01:31:35.115
Hey, we're in Alberta.

01:31:35.407 --> 01:31:35.999
Alberta?

01:31:36.282 --> 01:31:37.283
Alberta.

01:31:37.575 --> 01:31:39.498
Alberta, don't let
your hair hang down.

01:31:48.753 --> 01:31:50.272
I've loved you ever
sine the day I saw you.

01:31:50.296 --> 01:31:50.922
He ain't much of a boxer.

01:31:51.214 --> 01:31:52.511
I got to tell you.

01:31:52.799 --> 01:31:55.348
Jerry didn't love Janis
because she was a Sports

01:31:55.635 --> 01:31:57.478
Illustrated swimsuit model.

01:31:57.762 --> 01:32:00.515
He loved her for what she did.

01:32:00.807 --> 01:32:03.526
And the sparks
that she threw off,

01:32:03.810 --> 01:32:06.484
he had a right proper
appreciation for what Janis was

01:32:06.771 --> 01:32:07.811
and what she had to offer.

01:32:14.863 --> 01:32:16.740
From the Kentucky coal

01:32:17.032 --> 01:32:21.082
mines to the
California sun, Bobby

01:32:21.369 --> 01:32:24.964
shared the secrets of my soul.

01:32:25.248 --> 01:32:30.248
Her producer gave me a demo
of her singing "Bobby McGee."

01:32:39.512 --> 01:32:44.063
It was so exhilarating for me
to hear her make that her song.

01:32:44.350 --> 01:32:46.694
If you're a songwriter
and somebody

01:32:46.978 --> 01:32:49.652
does that with what you've
got, it's the greatest

01:32:49.939 --> 01:32:51.282
feeling in the world.

01:32:51.566 --> 01:32:54.240
But I'd trade
all of my tomorrows

01:32:54.527 --> 01:32:58.703
for one single
yesterday to be holding

01:32:58.990 --> 01:33:03.621
Bobby's body next to mine.

01:33:03.912 --> 01:33:09.385
And freedom's just another
word for nothing left to lose,

01:33:09.667 --> 01:33:13.012
nothing, that's all
my Bobby left me.

01:33:13.296 --> 01:33:14.639
I hear you're
making a new record.

01:33:14.923 --> 01:33:16.203
Yeah, and
it's really going good.

01:33:16.466 --> 01:33:17.558
I like my producer.

01:33:17.842 --> 01:33:19.361
He's really working
out very well with me.

01:33:19.385 --> 01:33:20.728
Who's producing it?

01:33:21.012 --> 01:33:22.138
Paul Rothchild.

01:33:22.430 --> 01:33:23.908
You haven't worked
with him before, huh?

01:33:23.932 --> 01:33:25.058
No, no, I haven't.

01:33:25.350 --> 01:33:27.523
The first time I talked
to Janis about Paul,

01:33:27.811 --> 01:33:29.984
she said, boy, that guy.

01:33:30.271 --> 01:33:31.271
And I said, what?

01:33:31.439 --> 01:33:33.533
And she started
talking about him.

01:33:33.817 --> 01:33:37.287
This is serious Janis, and I had
never heard her say this kind

01:33:37.570 --> 01:33:38.947
of stuff about anybody.

01:33:39.239 --> 01:33:42.789
She was talking about how much
she was learning from him.

01:33:43.076 --> 01:33:46.296
The mood was very up.

01:33:46.579 --> 01:33:50.300
I mean, as good as sessions
get, everybody in love

01:33:50.583 --> 01:33:55.180
with everybody else and
working very hard, and Janis,

01:33:55.463 --> 01:33:58.182
she was always ready
to do the most.

01:33:58.466 --> 01:34:01.720
She was a much better singer
than the world, or even she,

01:34:02.011 --> 01:34:03.011
knew.

01:34:08.810 --> 01:34:09.810
Oh, we knew.

01:34:10.061 --> 01:34:11.779
We knew there was
something here.

01:34:12.063 --> 01:34:15.158
And that was all, really,
that whole thing was

01:34:15.441 --> 01:34:17.864
spontaneous combustion
because she had

01:34:18.153 --> 01:34:19.700
an incredible sense of time.

01:34:19.988 --> 01:34:21.549
You listen to that stuff,
and like I tell you,

01:34:21.573 --> 01:34:23.826
it's like you're breathing.

01:34:24.117 --> 01:34:28.588
And the slowing down, and
it's like being in heaven.

01:34:28.872 --> 01:34:32.627
What he was asking her
to do was to understand

01:34:32.917 --> 01:34:35.386
the different voices
she had at her command.

01:34:35.670 --> 01:34:38.594
And the ramifications
for this, for Janis,

01:34:38.882 --> 01:34:42.056
were really profound because
she had always said...

01:34:42.343 --> 01:34:44.141
And she absolutely
meant it... oh, man.

01:34:44.429 --> 01:34:46.807
When I blow out my voice,
I'm going to buy a bar

01:34:47.098 --> 01:34:49.066
and retire in Marin County.

01:34:49.350 --> 01:34:52.980
What she was learning from Paul
was enabling her to see farther

01:34:53.271 --> 01:34:55.490
into the future,
and that's where

01:34:55.773 --> 01:34:57.650
Paul was looking all along.

01:34:57.942 --> 01:34:59.785
He said, 30 years
from now, I want

01:35:00.069 --> 01:35:01.821
you to be making
your best album,

01:35:02.113 --> 01:35:05.413
and I want you to be
making it with me.

01:35:05.700 --> 01:35:08.749
She called me on the
phone and she said,

01:35:09.037 --> 01:35:12.587
I gotta play on
the phone for you

01:35:12.874 --> 01:35:16.924
a song of Kris
Kristofferson's that I've just

01:35:17.212 --> 01:35:23.060
recorded... to hear that
voice, to hear her pride,

01:35:23.343 --> 01:35:26.563
to hear her excitement.

01:35:26.846 --> 01:35:28.974
I didn't hear it
till she was gone,

01:35:29.265 --> 01:35:35.739
and it was very
emotional for me.

01:35:36.022 --> 01:35:37.302
Uh, I could just
hear her saying,

01:35:37.565 --> 01:35:39.283
wait till that son of
a bitch hears this.

01:35:39.567 --> 01:35:40.567
You know?

01:35:47.951 --> 01:35:49.419
You know, everything
about it was

01:35:49.702 --> 01:35:52.080
positive for Janis,
except that she

01:35:52.372 --> 01:35:53.999
always hated the down hours.

01:35:57.585 --> 01:36:00.054
The Janis who says, how
come the guys in the band

01:36:00.338 --> 01:36:05.014
go home with these girls and I
go home alone, she was saying,

01:36:05.301 --> 01:36:08.145
you can't imagine how
hard it is to be me.

01:36:14.602 --> 01:36:18.106
She just didn't know
who to relax with.

01:36:18.398 --> 01:36:22.073
She just didn't know, anymore.

01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:24.454
A lot of pressure, you've
got to do this, Janis.

01:36:24.737 --> 01:36:27.206
You've got to do that.

01:36:27.490 --> 01:36:29.913
That's what made it
hard for her, I think.

01:36:30.201 --> 01:36:30.793
She loved everybody.

01:36:31.077 --> 01:36:34.081
That was the probably.

01:36:34.372 --> 01:36:38.218
She was like a little girl
lost, and then she would be

01:36:38.501 --> 01:36:41.050
as strong as a mountain lion.

01:36:49.721 --> 01:36:53.021
As far as anyone could
see, she had kicked heroin.

01:36:53.308 --> 01:36:54.901
She had replaced
it with alcohol,

01:36:55.184 --> 01:36:57.733
but it didn't look like
that was going to kill her.

01:36:58.021 --> 01:37:01.696
I think she just thought,
one last little, uh, hurrah.

01:37:04.819 --> 01:37:06.287
I can understand her wanting to.

01:37:06.571 --> 01:37:09.290
You know, oh, no
one's ever gonna know.

01:37:09.574 --> 01:37:13.670
I'll hang in my room, do
a hit, and then go to bed.

01:37:17.582 --> 01:37:20.506
Paul Rothchild called me,
and he said, Janis isn't here.

01:37:20.793 --> 01:37:22.966
Can you see if you can find her?

01:37:23.254 --> 01:37:26.599
And I pull out of the driveway,
and I just look up there.

01:37:26.883 --> 01:37:28.931
And I know which window
is hers, and there's

01:37:29.218 --> 01:37:31.812
a light in the window.

01:37:32.096 --> 01:37:35.066
And when I opened the
door, I had this really

01:37:35.350 --> 01:37:36.852
simple and direct feeling.

01:37:37.143 --> 01:37:39.111
Nobody's here.

01:37:39.395 --> 01:37:43.025
I came around the corner and
saw Janis lying by the bed.

01:37:46.944 --> 01:37:51.791
But that feeling of nobody
is here, it was right.

01:38:24.941 --> 01:38:29.913
I was standing at the stove,
boiling an egg or something.

01:38:30.196 --> 01:38:32.244
The radio said,
Janis Joplin, and I

01:38:32.532 --> 01:38:35.081
knew before they got the
last consonant in her name

01:38:35.368 --> 01:38:36.711
out that she was dead.

01:38:49.215 --> 01:38:56.520
And I wrote a telegram to Janis
that says, um, really miss you.

01:38:56.806 --> 01:38:59.935
Things aren't the same alone.

01:39:00.226 --> 01:39:02.524
I could meet you in
Kathmandu anytime,

01:39:02.812 --> 01:39:06.282
but late October
is the best season.

01:39:06.566 --> 01:39:10.070
Love you, Mama,
more than you know.

01:39:17.493 --> 01:39:18.790
I just fell apart.

01:39:19.078 --> 01:39:20.500
I just completely fell apart.

01:39:20.788 --> 01:39:23.507
She was in touch
with her own emotions

01:39:23.791 --> 01:39:28.592
and who she was in some way
that nobody else that I knew

01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:30.723
was that in touch with.

01:39:31.007 --> 01:39:33.806
And to be that way,
to try to get that,

01:39:34.093 --> 01:39:41.443
that's" that's the
price you pay for doing

01:39:41.726 --> 01:39:43.228
that kind of art on that level.

01:39:50.401 --> 01:39:52.620
Dear family, I'm awfully

01:39:52.904 --> 01:39:55.953
sorry to be such a
disappointment to,

01:39:56.240 --> 01:39:59.164
but I really do think there's
an awfully good chance

01:39:59.452 --> 01:40:01.830
I won't blow it this time.

01:40:02.121 --> 01:40:05.125
There is really nothing
more I can say right now.

01:40:05.416 --> 01:40:07.136
Guess I'll write more
when I have more news.

01:40:07.168 --> 01:40:11.548
Until then, address all
criticism to the above address.

01:40:11.839 --> 01:40:15.343
And please believe that you
can't possibly want for me

01:40:15.635 --> 01:40:17.603
to be a winner more than I do.

01:40:17.887 --> 01:40:18.887
Love, Janis.

01:40:21.766 --> 01:40:22.766
Sit there.

01:40:28.231 --> 01:40:29.231
Go on.

01:40:29.357 --> 01:40:33.032
Go on and count your fingers.

01:40:33.319 --> 01:40:41.045
I know what else, what else,
what have you got to do?

01:40:41.327 --> 01:40:45.252
And I know how you
feel, and I know you

01:40:45.540 --> 01:40:47.417
ain't got no reason to go on.

01:40:47.708 --> 01:40:49.881
I know you feel that
you must be through.

01:40:50.169 --> 01:40:53.389
Go on and sit right back down.

01:40:53.673 --> 01:40:55.846
I want you to count.

01:40:56.133 --> 01:41:03.813
Count your fingers, my
unhappy, my unlucky,

01:41:04.100 --> 01:41:08.822
but my little, my girl blue.

01:41:09.105 --> 01:41:11.324
I know you're unhappy.

01:41:11.607 --> 01:41:19.607
Oh, hun, I know, babe, I
know just how you feel.

01:41:59.905 --> 01:42:01.373
I thought I might share with you

01:42:01.657 --> 01:42:04.501
some comments made from some
of the people who loved her.

01:42:07.663 --> 01:42:11.668
Dearest family, although
I never ever met Janis,

01:42:11.959 --> 01:42:16.305
she was my best friend
in this whole world.

01:42:16.589 --> 01:42:19.809
Janis was a beautiful
person because she always

01:42:20.092 --> 01:42:23.187
put everything she
had into her music.

01:42:23.471 --> 01:42:28.102
She was and always will be
the mother of the blues.

01:42:28.392 --> 01:42:30.736
Words fail me now.

01:42:31.020 --> 01:42:35.025
Nevertheless, I am
very, very sorry.

01:42:35.316 --> 01:42:37.819
Women were way ballsier
then than they are now,

01:42:38.110 --> 01:42:42.536
and Janis was fearless with
her pain and with her truth.

01:42:42.823 --> 01:42:44.903
And that was one of the most
inspiring things for me,

01:42:44.992 --> 01:42:46.539
watching her, going, OK.

01:42:46.827 --> 01:42:52.800
I don't need to be anything
other than who I am.

01:42:53.084 --> 01:42:57.635
To perform that way with
those lyrics and those songs,

01:42:57.922 --> 01:43:01.142
and to feel there's
no lie in it,

01:43:01.425 --> 01:43:06.682
it is like... you might as well
be slashing yourself on stage

01:43:06.972 --> 01:43:08.349
and opening your skin.

01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:13.983
She, like, took a flag and
made a place in rock and roll

01:43:14.271 --> 01:43:15.693
for women.

01:43:15.981 --> 01:43:20.908
She was the first to really
feel that crazy light of what

01:43:21.195 --> 01:43:23.914
rock and roll was at the time.

01:43:24.198 --> 01:43:26.158
I know if you knew Janis
Joplin well, or if you...

01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:27.761
She sent me a birthday
tape on my birthday.

01:43:27.785 --> 01:43:29.429
Last birthday, Yoko asked
all different people

01:43:29.453 --> 01:43:30.454
to make a tape for me.

01:43:30.746 --> 01:43:32.015
And she was one of
them, and we got it.

01:43:32.039 --> 01:43:33.559
After she died, it
arrived in the post.

01:43:33.666 --> 01:43:35.826
And she was singing happy
birthday to me in the studio.

01:43:36.001 --> 01:43:37.979
What do you think could be
done about drug overdosing,

01:43:38.003 --> 01:43:39.471
in or out of the
profession of music?

01:43:39.755 --> 01:43:41.928
Well, I think the
basic thing nobody asked

01:43:42.216 --> 01:43:43.968
is why do people take
drugs of any sort,

01:43:44.260 --> 01:43:46.388
from alcohol to
aspros to hard drugs.

01:43:46.679 --> 01:43:48.865
I mean, is there something wrong
with society that's making us

01:43:48.889 --> 01:43:51.517
so pressurized that we
cannot live in it without

01:43:51.809 --> 01:43:53.903
guarding ourselves against it?
