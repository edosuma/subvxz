your age, actually.

Both my parents
died on the same night,

05:43.340 --> 05:45.310

05:45.310 --> 05:47.110
But you had your grandparents
to raise you,

and...I had my uncle Ray
to raise me.

but do you think
we could wait till tonight,

06:17.740 --> 06:19.470

a little less crowded?

06:19.470 --> 06:21.270
No, I want crowded.

About what?

07:01.150 --> 07:02.650
Parents.

07:04.420 --> 07:07.490
What about parents?

to grow up without 'em.

09:56.160 --> 09:58.890
Nah. We'll be downin' some
brewskies at Scully's tonight.

09:58.890 --> 09:59.890
You wait and see, Leo.

09:59.890 --> 10:00.890
I told ya,

10:00.900 --> 10:03.130
I'm invincible.

10:03.130 --> 10:04.260
Teddy.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.170
Please be okay.

10:06.170 --> 10:09.030
Please,
please be okay.

10:12.440 --> 10:14.410
Flanders.
Mickey Flanders.

10:14.410 --> 10:16.480
Uh, 3375 Verdugo Road.

10:16.480 --> 10:18.440
Hey, when do I get
my phone call?

10:18.450 --> 10:20.350
You get your phone call
when I say.

10:20.350 --> 10:21.910
Ooh! You see what
you got here, Leo,

10:21.920 --> 10:23.980
is a man frustrated
by his job.

10:23.990 --> 10:25.820
You know, you should
just take it from me and Leo

10:25.820 --> 10:26.820
and just chuck it all

10:26.820 --> 10:29.160
and go out
and blow off some steam.

10:29.160 --> 10:30.660
The only thing
I'm gonna blow off

10:30.660 --> 10:32.590
is that smart-ass attitude
you're sportin'.

10:32.590 --> 10:34.530
MICK:
Hey, why don't you
just finish up

10:34.530 --> 10:36.430
so I can make my phone call
and get outta here?

10:38.130 --> 10:40.200
You're not going anywhere.

10:40.200 --> 10:41.300
Not till the judge finds out

10:41.300 --> 10:42.800
whether that boy'll live or die.

10:42.800 --> 10:44.340
Hey, can you imagine
stickin' your beak

10:44.340 --> 10:46.240
in a loaded gun
for some bimbo stripper?

10:46.240 --> 10:47.310
Heh. If he lives,

10:47.310 --> 10:49.140
he's got a good life
lesson on him.

10:49.140 --> 10:52.880
Let me tell you
something...punk.

10:52.880 --> 10:55.410
That was his sister.

10:55.420 --> 10:57.850
And you're the one
in for a life lesson.

10:57.850 --> 10:59.590
Hey, what's your name
and your badge number?

10:59.590 --> 11:01.790
You got a bad attitude.

11:03.660 --> 11:05.160
Walker.

11:05.160 --> 11:06.960
And take a good look at it.

11:11.100 --> 11:12.330
You want a better look?

11:12.330 --> 11:13.700
I didn't say anything.

11:16.640 --> 11:18.100
Ranger Walker,
Trivette?

11:18.110 --> 11:20.410
Miss Cahill would like
to see you right away.

11:20.410 --> 11:22.180
Tell her we're bookin'
some prisoners now.

11:22.180 --> 11:24.680
She said ASAP.

11:26.180 --> 11:27.180
Hey, Randy.

11:27.180 --> 11:28.380
RANDY:
Yeah?

11:28.380 --> 11:30.120
Wanna finish givin'
these guys their stats?

11:30.120 --> 11:32.020
Hey, so long,
Walker.

11:32.020 --> 11:33.820
It was nice
meetin' ya.

11:33.820 --> 11:35.560
I'll remember you.

11:35.560 --> 11:37.520
What do you mean,
you're gonna let 'em go?

11:37.530 --> 11:40.230
Walker, I know
how upset you are.

11:40.230 --> 11:42.060
Two guys waltz into this place,

11:42.060 --> 11:44.300
rob and terrorize
everyone in there,

11:44.300 --> 11:46.870
and then they shoot a kid
who may or may not live,

11:46.870 --> 11:48.230
and now you're gonna let 'em go?

11:48.240 --> 11:49.870
What makes you think I'm upset?

11:49.870 --> 11:51.600
Look, I'm not happy
about this either.

11:51.610 --> 11:54.340
But I've got pressure coming
down on me from upstairs.

11:54.340 --> 11:55.680
All right?

11:55.680 --> 11:57.240
Pressure from upstairs?
From who?

11:57.250 --> 11:58.650
I can't go into that.

11:58.650 --> 12:01.280
You can't go--
What?!

12:01.280 --> 12:03.120
Look, all I can
tell you

12:03.120 --> 12:04.650
is that Mickey Flanders
and Leo Cale

12:04.650 --> 12:06.020
are not gonna be arraigned.

12:06.020 --> 12:08.150
They are not gonna be held,
they're not gonna be booked.

12:08.160 --> 12:10.490
I can't tell you
anything more, but...

12:10.490 --> 12:12.460
forget this case.

12:12.460 --> 12:14.930
It's not active.
It's not even a case.

12:19.600 --> 12:22.240
( sighing )

12:22.240 --> 12:24.100
Look...

12:24.110 --> 12:25.470
I hate this.

12:25.470 --> 12:27.140
I wanna tell
you more.

12:27.140 --> 12:28.680
Not that it would make
you feel better.

12:28.680 --> 12:30.980
But I hate issuing
commands like this

12:30.980 --> 12:33.810
and leaving so many
unanswered questions.

12:33.820 --> 12:36.050
There's only one
unanswered question, Alex.

12:36.050 --> 12:38.850
When are these hot rodders
gonna go out and do it again?

12:40.020 --> 12:41.790
Maybe that won't happen.

12:41.790 --> 12:43.460
Trust me, it will happen.

12:43.460 --> 12:45.460
We're just gonna let 'em
walk outta here and do it.

12:45.460 --> 12:47.060
No, we aren't.

12:47.060 --> 12:48.530
Forget it, Walker.

12:48.530 --> 12:49.860
Is that clear?

12:49.870 --> 12:51.730
This is an official order.

12:51.730 --> 12:53.770
Do not pursue this matter
for another second.

12:53.770 --> 12:54.800
You got it?

12:54.800 --> 12:56.740
I got it.

12:56.740 --> 12:59.110
But I'm not gonna take it.

13:01.040 --> 13:02.610
I mean it, Trivette.

13:02.610 --> 13:04.080
He is gonna get
into such deep trouble

13:04.080 --> 13:06.750
that nobody's gonna be
able to bail him out.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.850
Randy, I left you in charge
of those two prisoners.

13:14.860 --> 13:16.020
Where in the hell are they?

13:16.020 --> 13:17.890
They came and took 'em away.

13:17.890 --> 13:18.890
Who?

13:18.890 --> 13:20.660
A couple
of double-breasted suits.

13:20.660 --> 13:23.400
They had authorization
from the DA's office.

13:23.400 --> 13:24.400
Sorry. I th--

13:24.400 --> 13:25.630
Walker.

13:25.630 --> 13:27.470
You're not gonna
believe this, man.

13:30.140 --> 13:32.140
They're gone.

13:34.140 --> 13:37.210
Gone? What do you mean, gone?

13:37.210 --> 13:39.610
There's nothin' there.
It's gone.

13:39.610 --> 13:41.510
I thought once you put
something into a computer,

13:41.520 --> 13:42.520
it was permanent.

13:42.520 --> 13:44.520
Yeah, you can get
charges dropped,

13:44.520 --> 13:45.780
files misplaced,

13:45.790 --> 13:47.790
felonies can be squashed,
and to get yanked

13:47.790 --> 13:49.420
from the main computer
takes an act of God.

13:49.420 --> 13:51.060
Yeah, it's like we never
even arrested 'em

13:51.060 --> 13:53.290
in the first place.

14:02.240 --> 14:03.770
DANCER:
They say he's stable.

14:04.740 --> 14:05.870
( sighs )

14:05.870 --> 14:07.310
I guess that's, uh...

14:07.310 --> 14:08.370
That's what they call it

14:08.380 --> 14:10.040
if you're not gonna
die any second.

14:10.040 --> 14:11.440
Well, he's got
a strong will to live,

14:11.450 --> 14:12.780
and that's a good sign.

14:12.780 --> 14:14.210
Yeah.

14:14.220 --> 14:16.220
It counts for a lot.

14:16.220 --> 14:18.250
Well, what'll
really count for me

14:18.250 --> 14:20.090
is seeing the men
who did this get exactly

14:20.090 --> 14:22.560
what they deserve.

14:22.560 --> 14:24.320
I can't tell you
how important it's been for me

14:24.330 --> 14:25.690
just to hang on to that.

14:25.690 --> 14:27.060
Just knowing
that they were caught

14:27.060 --> 14:28.090
and that they won't go free.

14:28.100 --> 14:30.100
Thank you,
Ranger Walker...

14:30.100 --> 14:32.770
Ranger Trivette.

14:32.770 --> 14:35.430
Thank you both so much
for getting them.

14:35.440 --> 14:37.570
Well, Vickie,
there's something

14:37.570 --> 14:38.610
I've got to explain
to you.

14:38.610 --> 14:39.840
What is it?

14:39.840 --> 14:42.710
Well, the two men
we arrested...

14:42.710 --> 14:43.910
they've been released.

14:43.910 --> 14:45.780
Released?

14:45.780 --> 14:48.280
What do you mean, released?
You mean on bail?

14:48.280 --> 14:49.450
After what they did?

14:49.450 --> 14:51.720
TRIVETTE:
No, not on bail.

14:51.720 --> 14:53.220
The charges were dropped.

14:53.220 --> 14:54.950
Dropped?

14:57.960 --> 14:59.890
And-- There were all
those witnesses!

14:59.900 --> 15:01.730
I mean, you were there.
You saw!

15:01.730 --> 15:04.300
God!

15:04.300 --> 15:06.170
( exhales sharply )

15:08.670 --> 15:11.800
Well, I'm gonna go find
a rock to crawl under.

15:11.810 --> 15:14.870
Let's go find the rock
Mickey Flanders crawled under.

15:14.880 --> 15:16.040
I wish to heck
I could remember

15:16.040 --> 15:17.140
the exact address
he gave.

15:17.150 --> 15:19.410
W-- Wait a minute. Okay.

15:19.410 --> 15:21.410
Um, he said
somethin' about...

15:21.420 --> 15:23.480
goin' to Scully's to talk
to the boys tonight.

15:23.490 --> 15:25.750
Scully's. I've heard
of that place.

15:25.750 --> 15:27.690
It's a dance hall
over on Lockridge.

15:27.690 --> 15:28.860
Sounds about their speed.

15:28.860 --> 15:31.020
You and I are gonna
drop by there tonight.

15:31.030 --> 15:32.060
Now, wait-- Wait a minute.

15:32.060 --> 15:33.090
I'm supposed to remind you

15:33.090 --> 15:35.090
what Alex said
about us not buttin' in.

15:35.100 --> 15:36.230
Yeah, well,
you reminded me.

15:36.230 --> 15:37.230
I'll pick you up at 7.

15:37.230 --> 15:39.270
Good. Where you goin'?

15:39.270 --> 15:41.570
I have to pick up
a friend.

15:43.770 --> 15:45.770
( bell rings )

15:47.280 --> 15:49.780
( boys shouting indistinctly )

15:51.980 --> 15:53.150
Where'd he go?

15:53.150 --> 15:54.150
Go this way.
Come on!

15:55.020 --> 15:57.180
Don't let him get away!

15:57.190 --> 15:58.380
( boys shouting indistinctly )

15:58.390 --> 15:59.890
Get outta the way!

16:03.220 --> 16:04.220
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:04.230 --> 16:05.460
Slow down there,
partner.

16:05.460 --> 16:06.490
Ranger Walker.

16:06.490 --> 16:07.630
What are you doing here?

16:07.630 --> 16:08.960
I told you I may stop by.

16:08.960 --> 16:11.100
I hope you didn't go out
of your way or nothin'.

16:11.100 --> 16:13.170
Nah. How 'bout a lift?

16:14.600 --> 16:16.770
Well, unless
you'd rather walk.

16:16.770 --> 16:18.370
I'll take the lift.

16:18.370 --> 16:20.240
( chuckles ):
Okay, come on.

16:29.420 --> 16:30.920
Come on, guys.

16:32.150 --> 16:33.620
Here we go,
little buddy--

16:33.620 --> 16:37.090
C.D.'s special
super-duper triple-scooper.

16:37.090 --> 16:40.860
Guaranteed to give you
a bellyache for a week.

16:40.860 --> 16:42.930
Wow! Thanks, C.D.

16:45.630 --> 16:47.000
How much do I owe ya?

16:47.000 --> 16:48.400
Oh, it's on the house.

16:48.400 --> 16:50.300
I mean, uh, just don't tell
your grandparents

16:50.310 --> 16:51.900
who made you sick.

16:53.940 --> 16:55.670
You know, Archie,
eventually you're gonna

16:55.680 --> 16:58.340
have to face up
to those bullies.

16:59.580 --> 17:00.580
There you go.

17:00.580 --> 17:02.920
You ruined his appetite.

17:03.850 --> 17:05.319
I can't.

17:05.319 --> 17:06.750
Why not?

17:06.750 --> 17:08.250
'Cause.

17:09.359 --> 17:10.690
I'm afraid
of them.

17:10.690 --> 17:12.960
You know, it's a funny thing
about bullies.

17:12.960 --> 17:15.230
They only pick on kids
who are afraid of them.

17:15.230 --> 17:16.359
If you'd face this guy

17:16.359 --> 17:17.660
and look him right in the eye

17:17.670 --> 17:21.170
and say, "if you want a piece
of me, come and get it,"

17:21.170 --> 17:23.540
nine times out of ten,

17:23.540 --> 17:25.000
they're gonna back down.

17:25.010 --> 17:27.310
But what about
the other time?

17:27.310 --> 17:28.810
( chuckling ):
Well...

17:28.810 --> 17:30.040
well, then
you're gonna have to

17:30.040 --> 17:31.280
give it your best
shot, Archie.

17:31.280 --> 17:33.150
But believe me, win or lose,

17:33.150 --> 17:35.180
they're gonna know you're not
gonna take it anymore,

17:35.180 --> 17:36.850
so they're gonna find
some other scared kid

17:36.850 --> 17:37.950
to pick on.

17:37.950 --> 17:39.620
But they're
bigger than me.

17:39.620 --> 17:42.290
You gotta be bigger
than them up here.

17:42.290 --> 17:44.020
If you want to be
a good hitter, son,

17:44.030 --> 17:45.720
you gotta get up to bat.

17:45.730 --> 17:48.030
All the guys
that knocked the home runs...

17:48.030 --> 17:50.100
they've struck out
the most too.

17:50.100 --> 17:53.070
But they weren't afraid
of gettin' hit with the ball.

17:53.070 --> 17:54.070
Right, Cordell?

17:54.070 --> 17:55.070
That's right.

17:55.070 --> 17:57.270
It's just like
Archimedes said:

17:57.270 --> 17:59.010
"Give me a lever big enough,

17:59.010 --> 18:01.240
I'll move the world."

18:01.240 --> 18:02.240
Who?

18:02.240 --> 18:03.840
Archimedes. A scientist.

18:03.850 --> 18:05.180
He lived about, um...

18:05.180 --> 18:06.580
about, uh, 250 B.C.

18:06.580 --> 18:09.310
You know, back when they had
them big puffed pants?

18:11.790 --> 18:13.720
Uh...

18:13.720 --> 18:15.660
he's from out of town.

18:15.660 --> 18:18.160
His name is weirder
than mine!

18:18.160 --> 18:19.730
( chuckling )

18:19.730 --> 18:21.930
C.D., will you take Archie
home when he gets done?

18:21.930 --> 18:24.860
Yep. But we're gonna sit here
and eat all that ice cream.

18:24.870 --> 18:26.770
We're not gonna let that
homemade ice cream spoil,

18:26.770 --> 18:27.770
are we?

18:27.770 --> 18:28.770
Ranger Walker,
thanks.

18:28.770 --> 18:31.240
You're welcome,
Archie.

18:31.240 --> 18:32.600
Where's he going?

18:32.610 --> 18:34.740
To get a great big lever.

18:34.740 --> 18:35.910
He's gonna move the world.

18:35.910 --> 18:38.710

18:46.550 --> 18:48.920
He just got us sprung.

18:48.920 --> 18:49.960
We capped this guy

18:49.960 --> 18:51.620
in front of ten, 20,

18:51.630 --> 18:53.190
maybe 30 witnesses,

18:53.190 --> 18:55.760
and here I am,
back on the street.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.730
They didn't even
finish bookin' us.

18:57.730 --> 18:58.730
No way.

18:58.730 --> 19:00.100
Matter of fact,
maybe we oughta

19:00.100 --> 19:01.930
take a joyride,
take somethin' down.

19:01.940 --> 19:04.140
Then...you'll see.

19:04.140 --> 19:05.140
Evening, Leo.

19:07.170 --> 19:09.270
Your buddy's not here
to protect you tonight, Leo.

19:09.280 --> 19:10.980
Well, I don't know
what you want with me.

19:10.980 --> 19:14.180
I'm just havin' a couple brews
with my buds here.

19:14.180 --> 19:15.750
I didn't do
nothing wrong.

19:15.750 --> 19:17.980
Where is your buddy,
Mickey Flanders?

19:17.990 --> 19:18.980
What's the matter?

19:18.990 --> 19:20.720
Ain't he on your computer?

19:20.720 --> 19:23.060
No, he's not.
But we found you.

19:23.060 --> 19:24.160
Two-time loser,

19:24.160 --> 19:25.790
waitin' to go down
one more time.

19:25.790 --> 19:27.930
Three strikes,
you're out.

19:27.930 --> 19:30.060
Well, then, I guess,
Mr. Trivette,

19:30.060 --> 19:34.030
it would be in my best interest,
uh, to cooperate...

19:34.030 --> 19:36.640
with my friend Mickey...

19:36.640 --> 19:38.540
because he's invincible.

19:38.540 --> 19:41.510
And I stick with him,
then I'm invincible too!

19:41.510 --> 19:42.840
As a matter of fact,

19:42.840 --> 19:44.840
I think it would be
a good idea

19:44.850 --> 19:47.380
if the two of you
got out of this bar

19:47.380 --> 19:48.380
before I broke this bottle

19:48.380 --> 19:49.750
over your face!

19:51.720 --> 19:53.720
( screaming )

20:01.530 --> 20:02.700
Why, you--!

20:06.270 --> 20:07.330
Oh, hey, wait.
Yeah?

20:07.340 --> 20:08.830
Can you get me
an orange juice, please?

20:08.840 --> 20:10.300
Sure.
Clean glass.

20:10.300 --> 20:11.800
Always.

20:12.710 --> 20:13.710
C'mon, buddy.

20:20.980 --> 20:21.980
Very nice.

20:38.630 --> 20:39.930
You'd better
settle down, Leo,

20:39.930 --> 20:42.670
before you get me mad.

20:42.670 --> 20:44.200
Where's Mickey Flanders?

20:44.200 --> 20:45.800
You won't get away
with this.

20:45.810 --> 20:47.270
I already have.

20:48.180 --> 20:49.910
The next words
outta your mouth

20:49.910 --> 20:51.340
had better be
his address.

20:52.850 --> 20:55.480
( humming )

20:55.480 --> 20:57.620
Hey, this is a great
dinner, sis.

20:57.620 --> 20:59.650
Thank you.

20:59.650 --> 21:01.150
But I'm sorry,
I gotta hit the bricks.

21:01.160 --> 21:03.560
No, Mickey, no.
You can't go.

21:03.560 --> 21:04.820
I made all
your favorite foods.

21:04.830 --> 21:05.820
You can't go out tonight.

21:05.830 --> 21:07.530
Well, I-I--
What am I gonna do?

21:07.530 --> 21:08.790
Eat dinner? Sit around,

21:08.800 --> 21:11.630
watch the boob tube
and get brain rot?

21:11.630 --> 21:12.630
Not that you
got it, sis,

21:12.630 --> 21:13.900
but you know,
you should get out.

21:13.900 --> 21:15.230
You're young.
Live it up.

21:15.240 --> 21:17.470
Oh, and who shall
I live it up with?

21:17.470 --> 21:20.570
Leo and those other deadbeats
you hang around with

21:20.580 --> 21:21.810
at the pool hall?

21:21.810 --> 21:25.210
It's a dance hall
and Leo is a very cool dude.

21:25.210 --> 21:26.480
You know,
you should've gone out

21:26.480 --> 21:27.480
with him that time.

21:27.480 --> 21:28.980
Ew.
Come here.

21:28.980 --> 21:31.250
Mwah! You be good.

21:31.250 --> 21:32.790
Don't be late.

21:32.790 --> 21:34.150
All right.

21:34.150 --> 21:35.220
Hello, Mickey.

21:35.220 --> 21:36.890
Now, how the hell
did you get here?

21:36.890 --> 21:38.660
Leo sends
his regards.

21:38.660 --> 21:40.130
Mickey?

21:42.230 --> 21:43.360
Is everything
all right?

21:43.360 --> 21:45.300
Yeah, everything's
just hunky-dory.

21:45.300 --> 21:46.800
SISTER:
Well, then...

21:46.800 --> 21:48.030
what's the problem?

21:48.040 --> 21:50.400
Absolutely nothin',
sis, right?

21:50.400 --> 21:53.170
You two guys aren't on any
active case, are you?

21:53.170 --> 21:54.170
Miss Flanders?

21:54.180 --> 21:56.680
Yeah. Lainie Flanders.

21:56.680 --> 21:59.750
Did you know your brother
committed armed robbery,

21:59.750 --> 22:01.610
and in the process,
shot a man?

22:01.620 --> 22:03.820
What?

22:03.820 --> 22:05.250
Uh...no.
( chuckles )

22:06.850 --> 22:08.190
Don't listen
to these two gomers.

22:08.190 --> 22:10.720
I'm gonna sue you
right down to your belt buckle.

22:10.720 --> 22:12.360
You can't go around
saying these things!

22:12.360 --> 22:13.530
There weren't
any charges!

22:13.530 --> 22:17.030
No official charges,
but it happened just the same.

22:17.030 --> 22:18.300
And there's a man
in the hospital

22:18.300 --> 22:19.970
on life support
to prove it.

22:19.970 --> 22:23.170
No. No, I don't
believe it.

22:23.170 --> 22:24.500
And...I don't
believe you.

22:24.510 --> 22:26.440
And I don't know
what kind of sick joke

22:26.440 --> 22:28.640
this is,
but I want both of you

22:28.640 --> 22:30.810
to get off
of my porch.

22:30.810 --> 22:32.140
We wouldn't joke
about something

22:32.150 --> 22:33.580
this serious, ma'am.

22:33.580 --> 22:35.550
You heard my sister.
Get out!

22:35.550 --> 22:37.050
Now!

22:45.060 --> 22:46.690
Come on, Lainie--
No.

22:46.690 --> 22:49.090
Mickey...

22:49.100 --> 22:51.460
Now, you tell me
what happened!

22:51.470 --> 22:52.630
You wanna
know what happened?

22:52.630 --> 22:53.730
You wanna know?

22:53.740 --> 22:55.500
These guys, they're crazy.

22:55.500 --> 22:56.500
We didn't do nothin'.

22:56.500 --> 22:57.540
Come on.

22:57.540 --> 22:58.900
It's me.
It's Mickey.

22:58.910 --> 23:00.340
Gktt! Gktt!

23:00.340 --> 23:01.340
Don't!
When we were kids.

23:01.340 --> 23:02.340
Come on! It's Mick.

23:02.340 --> 23:03.940
Come here.
Come here.

23:03.950 --> 23:06.050
You're crazy.
You know that?

23:06.050 --> 23:07.180
You're crazy.

23:07.180 --> 23:09.010
Mmmwah!
I love you.

23:09.020 --> 23:10.880
Nothin' happened.
Nothin'.

23:10.880 --> 23:13.150
It better not
have happened.

23:17.560 --> 23:19.490
You can sure tell
his sister has no idea

23:19.490 --> 23:22.330
what kind of creepazoid
Flanders is, can't ya?

23:22.330 --> 23:23.830
Yeah.

23:25.300 --> 23:27.200
Okay. Where do we
go from here? Look...

23:27.200 --> 23:31.200
All right, when I went back
to the courthouse today,

23:31.200 --> 23:33.870
I ran Mickey Flanders
through every database

23:33.870 --> 23:36.710
of every computer
in the country I could access.

23:36.710 --> 23:38.240
And?

23:38.250 --> 23:39.980
Nothin' but a mechanic.

23:39.980 --> 23:41.550
Member of local 355.

23:41.550 --> 23:43.880
He's got no priors,
no DUI,

23:43.880 --> 23:46.920
not even a parking ticket.

23:46.920 --> 23:49.120
So explain to me
how a guy like that

23:49.120 --> 23:50.390
suddenly goes
on a rampage, man.

23:50.390 --> 23:51.890
Well, maybe
the Mickey Flanders

23:51.890 --> 23:54.660
we know of
doesn't exist.

23:54.660 --> 23:58.500
Why do you keep lookin'
in that rear view mirror?

23:58.500 --> 24:00.500
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

24:06.540 --> 24:08.610
Hands on the wheel!

24:08.610 --> 24:10.040
Just take it easy.

24:10.040 --> 24:11.940
You better have
a good reason for tailing us.

24:13.280 --> 24:14.280
Watch it.

24:14.280 --> 24:16.350
I'm just gonna
get the wallet.

24:25.590 --> 24:27.530
You Rangers were told
not to stick your badges

24:27.530 --> 24:28.690
where they don't belong!

24:32.470 --> 24:34.800
Seems I'm gonna
have to rip 'em off!

24:45.050 --> 24:47.550
(<i> light-hearted theme playing</i> )

24:56.590 --> 24:57.720
Good morning.

24:57.730 --> 24:59.990
( whinnies )

24:59.990 --> 25:01.190
Stay, Amigo.

25:01.200 --> 25:03.330
Good morning.

25:03.330 --> 25:06.530
Here...
For you.

25:06.530 --> 25:08.500
And what
is this for?

25:08.500 --> 25:09.670
A doughnut
and coffee,

25:09.670 --> 25:11.500
and there's not even
a favor attached.

25:11.510 --> 25:12.570
Mm-hm.

25:12.570 --> 25:13.640
That'll be a first.

25:15.180 --> 25:16.810
So, what are you doing
up so early?

25:16.810 --> 25:20.850
Up early? I haven't
been to bed yet.

25:20.850 --> 25:22.620
I have been on the phone
with everyone

25:22.620 --> 25:24.450
from the attorney general

25:24.450 --> 25:25.450
to the governor

25:25.450 --> 25:26.920
to the director
of the FBI.

25:26.920 --> 25:28.720
You kicked over a heck
of a hornet's nest.

25:28.720 --> 25:31.020
All in a day's work.

25:31.030 --> 25:32.630
That's not funny.

25:32.630 --> 25:35.590
I almost lost my job trying
to help you keep yours.

25:35.600 --> 25:36.960
Some job you got, Alex,

25:36.960 --> 25:38.830
protectin' a slimeball
like Mickey Flanders.

25:38.830 --> 25:42.130
Agent Escalante
explained it to you.

25:42.140 --> 25:44.000
They are not protecting
Mickey Flanders,

25:44.000 --> 25:45.740
they're protecting
his sister, Lainie.

25:45.740 --> 25:47.370
She's the one whose testimony
can put away

25:47.380 --> 25:49.340
the head of the Bayone
crime syndicate.

25:49.340 --> 25:50.910
But when she
agreed to join

25:50.910 --> 25:52.280
the Witness
Protection Program,

25:52.280 --> 25:54.810
she made a not-altogether
unreasonable request

25:54.820 --> 25:57.120
that her only living relative,
her brother,

25:57.120 --> 25:58.580
be brought along too.

25:58.590 --> 26:01.320
So because this gal's on
the Witness Protection Program,

26:01.320 --> 26:03.020
her brother has
an open ticket, right?

26:04.690 --> 26:07.030
Obviously, they don't
intend for the people

26:07.030 --> 26:08.560
in the program
to commit crimes,

26:08.560 --> 26:10.100
but it does happen.

26:10.100 --> 26:13.160
And apparently this case
is so big back in New Jersey,

26:13.170 --> 26:15.500
and it's gonna put away
so many mobsters,

26:15.500 --> 26:17.470
that they feel they
can't jeopardize it.

26:17.470 --> 26:19.040
So Vickie Hurley
sits in a hospital

26:19.040 --> 26:20.770
waiting to see if her brother
will live or die,

26:20.770 --> 26:22.140
and that's fair, right?

26:22.140 --> 26:24.980
No. Come on, Walker.

26:24.980 --> 26:28.210
You know what this guy told me,
this Agent Escalante?

26:28.220 --> 26:29.380
What?

26:29.380 --> 26:31.080
He said they haven't
even told her

26:31.080 --> 26:32.420
what her brother has done.

26:32.420 --> 26:33.820
They're afraid
it may spook her,

26:33.820 --> 26:35.850
and in turn she may think
that they'll cut her brother

26:35.860 --> 26:37.660
loose from the program.

26:37.660 --> 26:39.890
She doesn't even know, Alex.

26:39.890 --> 26:42.260
Apparently,

26:42.260 --> 26:45.160
that's one of the reasons
they're so upset with you,

26:45.170 --> 26:47.000
is that you tried to tell her.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.630
Oh, bull.

26:48.640 --> 26:52.140
Look, Walker...

26:52.140 --> 26:53.710
You're right.

26:53.710 --> 26:56.810
There's nothing I can say.
I hate it too.

26:56.810 --> 26:58.410
But you know what?

26:58.410 --> 27:01.280
I guess I am
asking you for a favor.

27:01.280 --> 27:03.620
I'm asking you
to sit this one out

27:03.620 --> 27:05.620
so we can continue
our work together

27:05.620 --> 27:06.850
after it's all over.

27:06.850 --> 27:09.790
A favor, Amigo.
What do you think?

27:09.790 --> 27:11.290
Hm?

27:12.690 --> 27:14.090
You can have
your doughnut back.

27:14.100 --> 27:15.460
(<i> mysterious theme playing</i> )

27:15.460 --> 27:17.530
Where are you going?

27:17.530 --> 27:18.730
To get ready.

27:18.730 --> 27:20.930
Ready for what?

27:20.940 --> 27:22.770
School.

27:23.370 --> 27:25.670
( whinnies )

27:27.410 --> 27:28.410
Ugh!

27:28.410 --> 27:29.680
Boo!

27:29.680 --> 27:32.580
So, Archibald,
are you gonna run,

27:32.580 --> 27:34.380
or are you waiting
for the Lone Ranger

27:34.380 --> 27:36.320
to ride up
in the nick of time?

27:36.320 --> 27:37.420
( all chuckle )

27:37.420 --> 27:39.850
I don't need anyone
to help me with you.

27:39.850 --> 27:41.990
You're cruisin'
for a bruisin',

27:41.990 --> 27:44.160
ain't you, squirt?

27:44.160 --> 27:45.790
Ugh!

27:46.930 --> 27:49.900
You're askin'
for it, ain't ya?

27:51.160 --> 27:53.130
Come on! Let's see
how tough you are

27:53.130 --> 27:54.930
without your friends
helping.

27:54.940 --> 27:56.040
You want a piece of me?

27:56.040 --> 27:57.540
Come and get it.

27:57.540 --> 27:58.770
You're serious?

27:58.770 --> 28:01.210
He's serious, Rick.
He's gonna fight you.

28:01.210 --> 28:02.740
Well,

28:02.740 --> 28:04.610
I don't wanna waste my time
with you, squirt.

28:04.610 --> 28:06.240
Come on, guys.

28:10.690 --> 28:13.050
You guys comin',
or what?

28:24.130 --> 28:25.430
How long
you been here?

28:25.430 --> 28:26.900
Heh-heh. Long enough.

28:26.900 --> 28:29.000
I guess they won't
be botherin' you anymore.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.570
Well, at least
not them.

28:32.910 --> 28:34.240
Thanks for coming by.

28:34.240 --> 28:35.670
I might've needed
your help.

28:35.680 --> 28:37.910
Heh. I don't think so.

28:37.910 --> 28:39.780
I think you had
everything under control.

28:39.780 --> 28:41.650
But I was afraid.

28:41.650 --> 28:43.250
I didn't know what
was gonna happen.

28:43.250 --> 28:44.980
I was really afraid.

28:44.990 --> 28:46.520
Well,

28:46.520 --> 28:48.420
being afraid's okay.

28:48.420 --> 28:50.490
In fact, getting knocked down
every once in a while's

28:50.490 --> 28:52.360
not the worst thing
in the world.

28:52.360 --> 28:53.690
You know,
if you ever meet a man

28:53.690 --> 28:55.390
who doesn't have
a scar or two,

28:55.400 --> 28:57.830
that means he never fought
for anything he believed in.

28:57.830 --> 28:59.730
Hey,

28:59.730 --> 29:01.330
that's what C.D. told me
last night

29:01.340 --> 29:02.800
when he was
driving me home.

29:02.800 --> 29:04.740
Heh. Well...

29:06.340 --> 29:07.570
...he's the one
that taught me.

29:07.580 --> 29:09.340
And how did you do?

29:09.340 --> 29:11.340
Did you find that lever
you need?

29:11.340 --> 29:12.610
Lever?

29:12.610 --> 29:14.410
You know,
to move the world.

29:14.410 --> 29:16.150
All you need
is the right lever.

29:16.150 --> 29:18.450
Heh-heh. Yeah, I found it.

29:18.450 --> 29:20.690
Now all I gotta do
is use it.

29:31.900 --> 29:34.370
Uh, Miss Flanders?

29:34.370 --> 29:35.630
Sorry, didn't mean
to scare you.

29:35.640 --> 29:36.640
I just need to--
Look!

29:36.640 --> 29:38.640
I don't have to speak to you.

29:38.640 --> 29:40.410
I have nothing to say
to you.

29:40.410 --> 29:42.310
I know you don't have to,
I have something to say--

29:42.310 --> 29:44.510
Look, I don't believe
any of the things

29:44.510 --> 29:46.780
you said about my brother,
so just leave us alone!

29:46.780 --> 29:48.450
I don't care if you believe
anything or not.

29:48.450 --> 29:49.620
I want to show
you something.

29:49.620 --> 29:51.550
Oh, really? What do you
want to show me?

29:51.550 --> 29:52.790
Huh?

29:52.790 --> 29:54.720
Look, I don't
have to see anything.

29:54.720 --> 29:56.860
I believe what
my brother told me.

29:56.860 --> 29:57.960
If you believe that,

29:57.960 --> 30:00.660
then you won't be afraid
to come with me.

30:02.730 --> 30:03.930
All right?

30:03.930 --> 30:06.230
All right.

(<i> brooding theme playing</i> )

30:19.950 --> 30:21.110
Oh, hi, Vickie.

30:21.120 --> 30:22.650
Hi, Ranger Walker.

30:22.650 --> 30:26.220
Oh, Vickie Hurley, this is, uh,
Lainie Flanders.

30:26.220 --> 30:28.220
Hi.
Hi.

30:28.220 --> 30:30.960
I'm really sorry
about your brother.

30:30.960 --> 30:34.830
Thanks. But he's gonna
be okay, you know?

30:34.830 --> 30:37.800
He just has to be.

30:37.800 --> 30:40.330
I just keep praying,
and I know that he will.

30:40.330 --> 30:42.030
He has to.

30:45.570 --> 30:47.340
Have you heard anything at all

30:47.340 --> 30:49.240
on those men?

30:49.240 --> 30:51.710
Not yet.

30:51.710 --> 30:54.110
Um, Ranger Walker

30:54.110 --> 30:55.510
told me about what happened.

30:56.620 --> 30:58.020
It's really awful.

30:58.020 --> 31:00.850
He said that you would
be able to identify

31:00.850 --> 31:02.250
the man who did this.

31:03.320 --> 31:05.090
I could pick him
out of a room of 50

31:05.090 --> 31:07.760
with the lights off.

31:07.760 --> 31:09.830
He was this close to me.

31:11.570 --> 31:13.730
He would've kidnapped me
and probably worse

31:13.730 --> 31:16.540
if my brother hadn't...

31:16.540 --> 31:18.140
(<i> melancholy theme playing</i> )

31:20.110 --> 31:21.910
He's gonna be okay,
you know.

31:21.910 --> 31:23.740
He has to.

31:23.740 --> 31:26.780
'Cause it'd be bad enough
losing him.

31:28.450 --> 31:30.880
But if I lose him,

31:30.880 --> 31:34.090
and the men who did this to him
go free,

31:34.090 --> 31:35.720
it would just be
too much.

31:35.720 --> 31:39.160
Then this whole damn world
would just go topsy-turvy.

31:39.160 --> 31:41.590
And I don't think that it
would ever make much sense.

31:43.500 --> 31:46.860
Excuse me.
I really need to go

31:46.870 --> 31:48.100
sit with Ted.

31:48.100 --> 31:50.500
It was nice meeting you,
Lainie.

31:55.340 --> 31:58.080
Lainie, I'm sorry
I had to do that to you.

31:58.080 --> 32:01.380
You realize what
you're asking me to do?

32:03.780 --> 32:05.480
To give up my brother.

32:05.490 --> 32:07.620
I don't want to lose him,

32:07.620 --> 32:10.660
any more than Vickie
wants to lose hers.

32:10.660 --> 32:12.760
I can understand that,
but protecting your brother

32:12.760 --> 32:14.930
from prosecution
is only encouraging him

32:14.930 --> 32:16.390
to commit more crimes.

32:17.970 --> 32:19.400
That's not what I'm doing.

32:19.400 --> 32:21.070
You are wrong about that.

32:21.070 --> 32:23.270
I'm not wrong, Lainie,
and you know it.

32:24.810 --> 32:26.440
I know you understand
the difference

32:26.440 --> 32:28.540
between right and wrong.

32:28.540 --> 32:29.710
Otherwise, you wouldn't have

32:29.710 --> 32:31.340
uprooted your life
the way you did.

32:31.350 --> 32:33.780
You know,

32:33.780 --> 32:37.350
it made it so much easier for me
knowing...

32:38.990 --> 32:41.850
that wherever
they finally put me...

32:44.060 --> 32:46.290
my little brother
was gonna be with me.

32:46.290 --> 32:49.160
Now I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

33:10.990 --> 33:12.050
Wait a minute, Lainie.

33:12.050 --> 33:13.450
What?

33:13.450 --> 33:15.850
Where are your agents?
Aren't they supposed to have

33:15.860 --> 33:17.390
24-hour surveillance
on your house?

33:19.060 --> 33:20.790
They're always supposed
to be out in the car.

33:20.790 --> 33:22.430
WALKER:
Well, there's no one in the car.

33:22.430 --> 33:23.660
Could they be in the house?

33:23.660 --> 33:25.760
No, they never
go in the house.

in the truck.

Are you okay?

34:40.310 --> 34:41.770
Yeah.

34:43.110 --> 34:44.440
They found me.

34:44.449 --> 34:47.510
Yeah, two guys
from the East Coast.

34:47.510 --> 34:49.380
Probably sent here
to keep you from testifying.

34:51.179 --> 34:52.850
How did they find me?

34:52.850 --> 34:54.620
Well, you brother and Leo
have been bragging

34:54.620 --> 34:56.760
around town a lot about
what they've been doing.

Amigo, Archie.

Which horse do you like?

35:11.670 --> 35:14.010
You mean I can pick
whichever one I want?

35:14.010 --> 35:16.410
You bet.
Horses are like people, Archie.

35:16.410 --> 35:18.340
Some of 'em you like,
some of 'em you don't.

35:18.350 --> 35:20.010
You don't wanna ride

You mean,
like my Aunt Louise?

35:23.080 --> 35:26.480
She's always hanging over me
with this really bad perfume,

35:26.490 --> 35:27.890
and kissing me and--

35:27.890 --> 35:28.990
Yuck!

35:28.990 --> 35:30.460
Yeah, like your Aunt Louise.

some tricks?

Yeah.

Okay.

twirl it for me? How's that?
