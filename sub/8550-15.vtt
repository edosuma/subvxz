GOD WASN'T SMILING.
HE JUST HAD GAS.

00:48.882 --> 00:51.085

TELL ME DETROIT.

12:07.460 --> 12:10.998

A SERIOUS RIDE.

10 YEARS IN THE SLAMMER.

12:22.776 --> 12:23.844
YOU STOLE THIS CAR?

12:23.911 --> 12:26.013
NOT STOLE. BORROWED.

OUT THE RESTAURANT,

12:30.984 --> 12:32.752
WE HAVE IT PARKED
AT THE CURB.

A $2.00 TIP.

12:40.560 --> 12:41.862
DON'T DO IT, EDD-O.

12:41.929 --> 12:44.464
LISTEN TO THAT LITTLE VOICE
ECHOING INSIDE OF YOU.

12:44.531 --> 12:46.466

IN THAT CAR.

THAT CARE ABOUT YOU,

MAKE A MISTAKE,

BORROWING THAT CAR.

18:24.070 --> 18:25.605

BORROWING.

18:25.672 --> 18:28.241

HAVE TO SEND HIM HOME.

20:08.308 --> 20:11.244
HOW COULD EDDIE DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

20:11.311 --> 20:12.912
WELL, HONEY,

20:12.979 --> 20:14.881
SOME POWERFUL TEMPTATION--

20:14.947 --> 20:16.883
FANCY CARS AND PRETTY GIRLS.

20:18.017 --> 20:20.953
HE WANTED TO LOOK COOL.

20:21.020 --> 20:22.822
THOSE THINGS
ARE HARD TO RESIST.

20:24.090 --> 20:25.458
YOU'RE RIGHT.

20:31.598 --> 20:33.633
I THINK HE KNOWS WHAT
HE DID WAS WRONG

20:33.700 --> 20:36.703
AND HE'S GENUINELY SORRY
THAT HE DID IT.

20:36.769 --> 20:40.139
AND THAT'S SOMETHING
TO BE GRATEFUL FOR.

20:40.206 --> 20:43.676
I GUESS WE DID
A FEW THINGS RIGHT.

20:43.743 --> 20:46.913

21:31.658 --> 21:34.327
WHY DON'T I REMIND YOU
WHERE THE DOOR IS?

21:34.394 --> 21:37.296
AH, IT'S SO GOOD
TO BE BACK.

21:38.230 --> 21:40.166
LET ME TELL YOU, LAURA.

21:40.232 --> 21:43.403
I'VE BEEN SCARED STRAIGHT.

21:43.470 --> 21:45.237
