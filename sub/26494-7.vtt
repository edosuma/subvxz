00:00.076 --> 00:01.827
You know my brother thinks
you can be saved.

00:01.829 --> 00:02.895
You don't believe that.

00:02.897 --> 00:03.863
No, I don't.

00:03.865 --> 00:05.197
And it comes to
killing you,

00:05.199 --> 00:06.665
I'll be the one to do it.

00:08.402 --> 00:09.969
No.

00:09.971 --> 00:11.170
Aah!

00:11.172 --> 00:12.671
I just need your power.

00:16.844 --> 00:19.345
I know this must be
so hard without your grace,

00:19.347 --> 00:20.596
but you can get past this.

00:23.768 --> 00:24.767
You did good, kid.

00:24.769 --> 00:25.884
I was right.

00:25.886 --> 00:27.052
You're pretty smart
sometimes.

00:31.371 --> 00:32.487
Jack?!

00:33.907 --> 00:36.157
I don't understand
how Lucifer could die

00:36.159 --> 00:37.242
and I could live...

00:37.244 --> 00:39.360
Aaah!

00:39.362 --> 00:42.196
...how I would let
Lucifer possess me.

00:42.198 --> 00:43.548
You were in a lot of pain.

00:43.550 --> 00:45.533
I'm gonna find out
who killed my family.

00:45.535 --> 00:49.421
I thought I saw something,
but I was wrong.

00:49.423 --> 00:51.556
I don't know anything.

00:51.558 --> 00:52.807
I think you do.

00:56.013 --> 00:59.481
I know I've got issues.

00:59.483 --> 01:02.317
It's not like I want
to do this, okay?

01:02.319 --> 01:04.102
I need to.

01:04.104 --> 01:06.888
I know I should stop.

01:06.890 --> 01:10.391
It's just that...

01:10.393 --> 01:15.563
these feelings afterward...

01:15.565 --> 01:18.700
I hate.

01:18.702 --> 01:22.037
I hate

01:22.039 --> 01:26.591
that it feels so good.

01:26.593 --> 01:29.794
Anyway, I know I've taken up
too much of your time.

01:33.300 --> 01:35.467
If you say you can't tell me

01:35.469 --> 01:39.087
what Arty told you during
confession, I accept that.

01:39.089 --> 01:42.524
Of course, he was the only
witness to my family's murder,

01:42.526 --> 01:44.726
but I understand you got
your vows to keep and all that,

01:44.728 --> 01:48.146
but...

01:48.148 --> 01:49.948
You really shoulda helped me.

01:52.602 --> 01:54.069
Okay?

01:54.071 --> 01:58.373
So you brought this
on yourself.

01:58.375 --> 02:01.326
But, look, I will take
some of your advice.

02:01.328 --> 02:03.294
Perhaps...

02:03.296 --> 02:04.996
Perhaps the peace
I'm looking for

02:04.998 --> 02:08.666
does lie in the power of prayer.

02:08.668 --> 02:11.619
And I do agree with you, Padre.

02:11.621 --> 02:13.788
There is a Devil,

02:13.790 --> 02:17.642
and we should try to fight him.

02:17.644 --> 02:19.561
Sometimes we just can't.

02:22.232 --> 02:23.932
Hang in there.

- What's taking so long?
- I don't know.

03:17.020 --> 03:19.737
Whatever's going on with Jack
is probably complicated.

03:19.739 --> 03:21.990
Yeah, but, I mean, weird stuff
happens to kids all the time.

03:21.992 --> 03:25.493
They get coughs,
bloody noses.

03:27.497 --> 03:28.546
Is he okay?

03:29.749 --> 03:32.333
I -- I did what I could,
but I don't --

03:33.303 --> 03:36.370
I -- I don't know what's
wrong with him.

03:36.372 --> 03:38.590
But you can figure it out,
right?

03:40.427 --> 03:42.710
Jack?

03:42.712 --> 03:43.761
Jack?

03:46.066 --> 03:48.433
Hey.

03:48.435 --> 03:50.318
Jack!

03:56.526 --> 03:58.359
I need a doctor!

03:58.361 --> 03:59.611
Hey.

04:03.233 --> 04:04.732
Look, could you just
get him inside?

04:04.734 --> 04:06.067
Sir, I just need
some basic information.

04:06.069 --> 04:07.401
That's the procedure.

04:07.403 --> 04:09.003
I do the work-up,
then I take him back.

04:09.005 --> 04:10.588
Okay, the basic information
is he's sick.

04:10.590 --> 04:14.008
Do you see anyone here
who isn't?

04:14.010 --> 04:17.245
His full name, please.

04:17.247 --> 04:19.346
You do know his name,
right?

04:19.349 --> 04:20.849
Jack.

04:24.187 --> 04:27.722
Uh, uh, Kline.
Jack Kline.

04:27.724 --> 04:30.525
K-l-i-n-e.

04:30.527 --> 04:31.559
Date of birth?

04:31.561 --> 04:33.144
Come on.
Is that important?

04:33.146 --> 04:34.595
What did you say your
relationship is to the patient?

04:34.597 --> 04:36.564
May 18th.

04:36.566 --> 04:39.033
Date of birth --
May 18th.

04:40.937 --> 04:43.437
2000 -- '99.

04:43.439 --> 04:45.874
2000.

04:45.876 --> 04:48.209
Uh-huh.
Family medical history?

04:48.211 --> 04:50.912
Let's start with the father.

04:50.914 --> 04:52.947
He's dead.

04:52.949 --> 04:54.716
Cause of death?

04:55.886 --> 04:58.419
He was stabbed through
the heart, and he exploded.

05:00.290 --> 05:01.973
Okay, you know what?
We don't have time for this.

05:01.975 --> 05:04.309
All right, he's sick.
His name is Jack Kline.

05:04.311 --> 05:05.510
His father exploded.

05:05.512 --> 05:06.811
There, you've got
all the basics.

05:06.813 --> 05:08.629
Now what does he need
to do to see a doctor?

05:08.631 --> 05:09.931
Jack!

05:09.933 --> 05:10.899
Jack?!

05:13.270 --> 05:16.137
It's all right, Jack.
Hang in there, buddy.

05:16.139 --> 05:17.405
Jack, hey, we're
right here, buddy.

05:17.407 --> 05:20.108
He's in good hands.
Don't worry.

05:25.081 --> 05:27.498
So, there's -- there's been...
Uh, he's been coughing. There's been blood.

05:27.500 --> 05:28.514
Okay, gentlemen, can you at
least wait outside, please?

05:28.538 --> 05:29.285
It's been going on for a while.

05:29.286 --> 05:30.818
What's happened?
Is he gonna be okay?

05:30.820 --> 05:32.453
- The doctor will handle it.
- Okay.

05:32.455 --> 05:35.423
Jack, we're right here!

06:23.840 --> 06:26.174
Nick?

06:26.176 --> 06:27.759
Hello. Diane Fargo.

06:27.761 --> 06:29.710
Hey, yeah.

06:29.712 --> 06:31.562
Yeah, you weren't easy
to track down.

06:31.564 --> 06:34.766
I left Pike Creek
six years ago.

06:34.768 --> 06:36.889
I'm working at the <i>Tribune</i>
here in Wilmington.

06:36.913 --> 06:37.486
Oh.

06:37.487 --> 06:39.570
-What can I get you?
-Coffee, please.

06:39.572 --> 06:41.055
Well,
thanks for seeing me.

06:41.057 --> 06:44.692
I didn't think you were
gonna remember who I am.

06:44.694 --> 06:46.244
Of course I do.

06:46.246 --> 06:49.330
I spoke to you the morning
after your family was...

06:49.332 --> 06:51.032
Slaughtered.

06:53.753 --> 06:57.422
And then you left town.

06:57.424 --> 06:59.791
Yeah, just...

06:59.793 --> 07:03.344
I couldn't stay, you know?
Too much baggage.

07:03.346 --> 07:06.481
I had to rebuild.

07:06.483 --> 07:07.465
Thank you.

07:07.467 --> 07:08.966
You're welcome.

07:08.968 --> 07:13.021
My ex-neighbor, Arty Nielsen,
was killed a few weeks ago.

07:13.023 --> 07:15.423
- Really?
- Yeah, so...

07:15.425 --> 07:17.892
just brought back all kinds
of bad memories, you know,

07:17.894 --> 07:22.313
and, uh, I was just
looking for some answers.

07:22.315 --> 07:24.032
To...?

07:24.034 --> 07:27.068
My family.

07:27.070 --> 07:28.236
The case was never solved.

07:28.238 --> 07:29.603
The one witness was Arty,

07:29.605 --> 07:33.408
and he said that he
saw someone leaving my house

07:33.410 --> 07:34.542
the night of the murders,

07:34.544 --> 07:36.494
and then he changed
his story.

07:36.496 --> 07:38.446
It happens.

07:38.448 --> 07:40.164
People say things
in the heat of the moment,

07:40.166 --> 07:42.467
and then realize
they're not so sure.

07:42.469 --> 07:44.719
Even you gave up
on the story.

07:46.890 --> 07:49.390
There was almost no evidence
at the crime scene.

07:49.392 --> 07:50.508
Mm-hmm.

07:50.510 --> 07:52.393
The cops had zero
to say to me.

07:52.395 --> 07:54.729
I even played with the idea
you did it, but you...

07:54.731 --> 07:58.316
Well, I was getting hammered
at the Elks Lodge that night.

07:58.318 --> 08:01.102
So...I moved on.

08:04.023 --> 08:07.024
Yeah, well, I can't.

08:07.026 --> 08:08.076
Nick?

08:08.078 --> 08:10.828
No, I'm good.

08:10.830 --> 08:12.613
Seriously.

08:12.615 --> 08:15.083
As -- As soon as I figure out
what happened that night,

08:15.085 --> 08:17.985
these demons will disappear.

08:17.987 --> 08:22.623
Look, you were
a crime reporter, right?

08:22.625 --> 08:26.928
So you've got to know all
the beat cops in Pike Creek.

08:26.930 --> 08:28.162
Sure.

08:28.164 --> 08:29.847
Okay, do you happen to
remember who was assigned

08:29.849 --> 08:33.267
to my neighborhood
that night?

08:33.269 --> 08:35.520
I think so.
All right.

08:35.522 --> 08:38.523
I'm...pretty sure

08:38.525 --> 08:41.509
it was Frank --
Frank Kellogg.

08:41.510 --> 08:42.777
Frank Kellogg.

08:42.779 --> 08:44.612
Last I heard,
he was doing private security

08:44.614 --> 08:47.148
up in Montauk.

08:47.150 --> 08:50.535
Frank Kellogg, Montauk.

08:58.711 --> 09:00.795
This is crazy.

09:00.797 --> 09:02.547
When Jack became human,
I was worried, you know,

09:02.549 --> 09:04.698
given what we do, that -- that
something would happen to him,

09:04.700 --> 09:07.201
but I thought it'd be
a vampire or a ghoul,

09:07.203 --> 09:09.137
not a friggin' cough.

09:09.139 --> 09:10.638
He's just a kid.

09:10.640 --> 09:12.974
Hey, hey, hey.

09:12.976 --> 09:14.058
Cass.

09:14.060 --> 09:15.643
Doctor.

09:15.645 --> 09:17.979
So, um...

09:17.981 --> 09:19.180
What do we know?

09:19.182 --> 09:21.065
Well, I can tell you
what we don't know.

09:21.067 --> 09:22.517
I don't like
the sound of that.

09:22.519 --> 09:25.319
Jack's test results
all came back negative.

09:25.321 --> 09:26.737
That's great, right?

09:26.739 --> 09:30.658
Well, Jack --
he's very ill.

09:30.660 --> 09:32.393
We're just not sure
what we're up against.

09:32.395 --> 09:33.911
You just said his tests
came back negative.

09:33.913 --> 09:36.247
Well, those tests,
but we have to run more tests.

09:36.249 --> 09:37.698
<i>More</i> tests?

09:37.700 --> 09:39.250
Yes, until we can figure out
what's happening to him.

09:39.252 --> 09:42.420
What is happening to him
right now?

09:42.422 --> 09:44.005
Jack...

09:46.593 --> 09:50.244
Jack's in total
systemic failure.

09:50.246 --> 09:52.763
His body's in the process
of shutting down.

10:01.772 --> 10:03.906
Lemme ask you a question.

10:03.908 --> 10:05.808
How much longer
are we gonna give this?

10:05.810 --> 10:07.509
How many more tests
are there gonna be?

10:07.511 --> 10:10.379
My opinion?
I think we're done here.

10:10.381 --> 10:12.097
Yeah, that was kinda
my opinion, too.

10:12.099 --> 10:13.549
I mean, this place,
we tried,

10:13.551 --> 10:15.284
but they've never seen
anything like Jack,

10:15.286 --> 10:17.119
and we can't exactly
tell them what he is.

10:17.121 --> 10:19.088
Then let's get
him out of here.

10:19.090 --> 10:21.757
Let's bring him home.
Let's do what we do.

10:21.759 --> 10:24.426
Let's find a way.

10:24.428 --> 10:26.829
Hell, I was even thinkin'
maybe Rowena...

10:26.831 --> 10:28.614
Already called her.

10:37.408 --> 10:40.159
Uh, what --
What's going on?

10:40.161 --> 10:41.577
What's it look like?

10:41.579 --> 10:43.462
You can't expect him to hit
the street with nothing on

10:43.464 --> 10:45.214
but a hospital gown,
his ass hanging out.

10:45.216 --> 10:46.448
He's not going anywhere.

10:46.450 --> 10:49.117
We're just getting
a second opinion.

10:49.119 --> 10:52.638
Jack?

10:52.640 --> 10:56.425
We're getting a second opinion.

10:56.427 --> 10:57.593
If he leaves the hospital,

10:57.595 --> 10:59.011
we are no longer responsible
for him.

10:59.013 --> 11:00.462
You and he have to acknowledge

11:00.464 --> 11:02.014
that you're leaving
against medical advice.

11:02.016 --> 11:04.683
- Fine.
- We're leaving.

11:04.685 --> 11:09.655
Yeah, there's just no talkin'
to him when he gets like this.

11:09.657 --> 11:12.441
- Thanks for coming.
- I got here quick as I could.

11:12.443 --> 11:13.742
How is he?

11:13.744 --> 11:14.827
Well, uh...

11:14.829 --> 11:16.862
I brought the
Book of the Damned.

11:16.864 --> 11:19.981
Which, uh, you stole.

11:19.983 --> 11:22.785
Which I borrowed amidst
the ruckus

11:22.787 --> 11:24.653
of all those folks
arriving from the other world,

11:24.655 --> 11:26.121
but we can talk
about that later.

11:26.123 --> 11:28.424
Just how sick is Dean?

11:28.426 --> 11:31.260
Yeah, about that, um...

11:31.262 --> 11:33.378
What?

11:33.380 --> 11:34.763
Is this a trick?

11:34.765 --> 11:36.432
Samuel, I thought
we were beyond this.

11:36.434 --> 11:38.884
Somebody is sick,
all right, but...

11:38.886 --> 11:41.503
Listen, I-I don't know how
well you got to know

11:41.505 --> 11:43.138
our -- our --
our friend Jack

11:43.140 --> 11:45.340
with everything that was
going on when you were here,

11:45.342 --> 11:47.810
but we've sort of been
taking care of him,

11:47.812 --> 11:51.814
and, uh, he's, um...

11:51.816 --> 11:54.283
Lucifer's son.

11:54.285 --> 11:55.517
Goodbye.

11:55.519 --> 11:57.569
No, no, no. Stop, stop.
He's a great kid.

11:57.571 --> 12:00.205
His mother was
a fantastic human being,

12:00.207 --> 12:03.625
a-a-and he wanted nothing
to do with Lucifer,

12:03.627 --> 12:05.694
w-who is dead,
as you know.

12:05.696 --> 12:06.995
I hope he's rotting.

12:06.997 --> 12:09.164
Yes, but Lucifer
stole Jack's grace,

12:09.166 --> 12:11.166
so he's powerless now,
and -- and something's

12:11.168 --> 12:12.801
going on with him,
and he might die.

12:12.803 --> 12:15.254
Oh, splendid!
The sooner the better!

12:15.256 --> 12:16.705
From what I know
of the father,

12:16.707 --> 12:19.224
the world will be better off
without the son.

12:19.226 --> 12:21.844
You might be right.

12:24.648 --> 12:27.683
We're all still
figuring that out.

12:31.605 --> 12:33.021
I'm Jack.

12:33.023 --> 12:35.941
And I know people have
a lot of strong feelings

12:35.943 --> 12:38.911
about my father, but I'm --

12:38.913 --> 12:42.247
I'm trying hard
not to be like him.

12:44.735 --> 12:48.236
Sam and Dean, they -- they say
such nice things about you.

12:48.238 --> 12:50.038
They do?

12:50.040 --> 12:53.842
You saved all of us --
from Apocalypse World.

12:53.844 --> 12:56.912
Well, that's true.

12:56.914 --> 12:59.097
So, before you go,

12:59.099 --> 13:01.800
I -- I just wanted to say...

13:01.802 --> 13:03.435
thank you.

13:07.257 --> 13:08.557
Jack.

13:08.559 --> 13:11.527
Hey, buddy. Hey.
You're all right.

13:11.529 --> 13:14.613
Bollocks.

13:16.901 --> 13:21.236
Possim rei huius cognoscere
causas...

13:24.441 --> 13:28.877
Possim rei huius cognoscere
causas...

13:42.593 --> 13:44.393
How am I?

13:56.357 --> 13:57.305
And?

13:57.307 --> 13:58.974
It's as I suspected.

13:58.976 --> 14:00.776
A nephilim,
for all its power,

14:00.778 --> 14:02.310
is an unnatural presence.

14:02.312 --> 14:03.745
Part human, part angel...

14:03.747 --> 14:06.815
It -- It doesn't quite fit.
It's delicate.

14:06.817 --> 14:08.867
Its grace is what
holds it in balance,

14:08.869 --> 14:11.336
and when Jack's grace
was taken from him,

14:11.338 --> 14:13.372
his being fell into chaos.

14:13.374 --> 14:16.174
The -- The cells
are gobbling each other up.

14:16.994 --> 14:20.462
Well, if it's grace he needs,
he can have mine.

14:20.464 --> 14:22.798
No, dear, it won't do.

14:22.800 --> 14:24.549
Jack is part archangel.

14:24.551 --> 14:27.269
He needs
a much stronger force

14:27.271 --> 14:28.971
and probably
some kind of magic,

14:28.973 --> 14:30.338
and he needs it quick.

14:30.340 --> 14:32.107
- How quick?
- I don't...

14:32.109 --> 14:35.694
I don't exactly know, but he's
enterin' a critical phase.

14:35.696 --> 14:37.345
Sometimes he'll look
just fine,

14:37.347 --> 14:41.016
but then his body
will give way and...

14:41.018 --> 14:45.203
it'll be the end of him.

14:50.544 --> 14:52.377
Hey.

15:07.261 --> 15:08.810
Yeah, no.

15:08.812 --> 15:10.679
Wasn't sure which one you
thought would be the best one.

15:11.765 --> 15:15.216
Don't do it.
Don't do it.

15:15.218 --> 15:17.102
Don't do it.

15:21.575 --> 15:25.661
Evening.

15:25.663 --> 15:28.497
Evening yourself.

15:28.499 --> 15:29.698
You're out here alone?

15:29.700 --> 15:32.250
That's sort of dangerous,
isn't it?

15:35.255 --> 15:38.173
Weird!
That sounded weird.

15:38.175 --> 15:40.241
I just meant be safe.

15:40.243 --> 15:43.378
Just hadda use my phone.
I'm headed back in.

15:43.380 --> 15:45.380
Copy that.

15:45.382 --> 15:47.883
Have fun.

15:54.858 --> 15:57.025
Did you wanna come in?

16:00.364 --> 16:02.397
Meet my friends...?

16:02.399 --> 16:04.700
That sounds awesome,

16:04.702 --> 16:08.320
but it's a nice night,
and it's so loud in there.

16:08.322 --> 16:11.990
I know.
That's the best part.

16:11.992 --> 16:13.959
Come on.
It'll be fun.

16:21.502 --> 16:24.386
Get away from me.

16:24.388 --> 16:25.420
...what?

16:25.422 --> 16:27.973
Get away from me!

16:27.975 --> 16:30.475
Now!

16:30.477 --> 16:31.510
Go!

16:53.230 --> 16:55.065
Hey, pal.
I brought you some carbs.

16:55.067 --> 16:56.900
You, uh...

16:56.902 --> 17:00.270
You goin' somewhere?

17:00.272 --> 17:03.639
Thought I'd go to Vegas.
Maybe Tahiti.

17:03.641 --> 17:05.108
Okay.

17:06.328 --> 17:08.194
Nice.

17:08.195 --> 17:09.829
You think this is
the best time?

17:09.830 --> 17:11.948
Pretty sure it is.

17:14.502 --> 17:15.452
Listen, Jack --

17:15.454 --> 17:16.502
Since I've been alive,

17:16.505 --> 17:17.837
everyone assumed
I would be

17:17.839 --> 17:20.957
this special "person"
who goes on forever.

17:20.959 --> 17:23.460
Only now it looks like
forever

17:23.462 --> 17:25.494
might be a couple
of weeks, so --

17:25.497 --> 17:27.547
We don't know that.

17:27.549 --> 17:31.217
What I do know is
I'm done being special.

17:31.219 --> 17:33.636
Before my life is over,

17:33.638 --> 17:36.339
I want to live it.

17:36.341 --> 17:40.026
I-I just want
a chance to...

17:40.028 --> 17:42.678
get a tan...

17:42.680 --> 17:45.848
to see a hockey game...

17:45.850 --> 17:47.534
get a parking ticket...

17:49.354 --> 17:51.621
...get bored...

17:51.623 --> 17:55.241
and when
it's all over...

17:55.243 --> 17:56.376
die.

17:59.831 --> 18:02.582
So that's your plan,
huh?

18:02.584 --> 18:05.135
I don't want to
waste time arguing.

18:05.137 --> 18:07.303
I know you disagree.

18:07.305 --> 18:11.057
Did I say I disagree?

18:11.059 --> 18:13.176
...and how likely
do you think that is?

18:13.178 --> 18:15.311
Because no Hunter I've spoken to
has heard of anything.

18:15.313 --> 18:17.597
...I know you're not
speakin' to me, Magda,

18:17.599 --> 18:20.049
basically no one
is speakin' to me,

18:20.051 --> 18:21.735
but I have a situation.

18:21.737 --> 18:25.772
There's a wee nephilim
I know who's ailing...

18:25.774 --> 18:27.890
Dean --

18:27.892 --> 18:30.226
the bunker's vault has a number
of Enochian texts

18:30.228 --> 18:34.297
on archangels, but nothing
on their half-human offspring.

18:34.299 --> 18:37.133
And I've spoken to some of the
greatest minds in witchcraft,

18:37.135 --> 18:39.836
and they all say there's
nothing that'll help Jack.

18:39.838 --> 18:43.239
Well, then, they're not
the greatest minds, are they?

18:43.241 --> 18:45.308
Well, I just got off
the phone with Ketch.

18:45.310 --> 18:47.043
Um, he's got a line
on a shaman.

18:47.045 --> 18:48.178
A shaman?

18:48.180 --> 18:49.646
Yeah,
the British Men of Letters

18:49.648 --> 18:51.448
used to use him --
as a consultant.

18:51.450 --> 18:53.967
Whenever they needed to
"solve the unsolvable" --

18:53.969 --> 18:55.769
he was their guy.

18:55.771 --> 18:58.104
He's an expert in mysticism --

18:58.106 --> 19:00.190
esoteric divinity.

19:00.192 --> 19:03.259
I mean, Ketch says
the Brits swore by him.

19:03.261 --> 19:04.894
Ketch "says."

19:04.896 --> 19:07.096
Yeah.

19:07.098 --> 19:09.282
His name is "Sergei,"
I-I got a location,

19:09.284 --> 19:13.769
and Ketch says
he'll set up a meeting.

19:13.771 --> 19:15.321
Okay, I'll go.

19:15.323 --> 19:18.241
You and Dean need to
stay here with, uh...

19:19.777 --> 19:21.711
Jack, hey.

19:21.713 --> 19:23.079
W-What are you, uh --

19:23.081 --> 19:25.781
We're -- We're headed out.

19:25.783 --> 19:27.967
You're, uh...

19:27.969 --> 19:29.836
Where?

19:29.838 --> 19:33.056
We're takin' Baby
for some exercise.

19:33.058 --> 19:36.309
You think that's
a good idea?

19:36.311 --> 19:37.927
Yeah.

19:39.815 --> 19:42.182
Come on.

19:53.912 --> 19:56.613
Hey.
Why don't you drive?

19:56.615 --> 19:58.314
...what?

19:58.316 --> 20:00.483
Dean, I-I don't drive.

20:00.485 --> 20:02.285
Now you do.

20:04.789 --> 20:07.457
Okay, um...

20:07.459 --> 20:09.709
Ah, ah, ah.
That "R" is not for "Race."

20:09.711 --> 20:11.494
Put it in park.

20:11.496 --> 20:13.046
- Okay.
- Start it.

20:13.048 --> 20:14.180
Um...

20:14.182 --> 20:15.498
Oh, boy.

20:16.518 --> 20:17.550
There we go.

20:17.552 --> 20:18.501
Okay.

20:18.503 --> 20:20.103
D for "Drive."

20:35.019 --> 20:37.687
Okay. All right.
Okay, uh...

20:37.689 --> 20:39.405
Keep going.

20:41.243 --> 20:42.408
That...

20:42.410 --> 20:44.026
Okay, look.
You know what?

20:44.028 --> 20:45.995
- I'm not very good at this.
- No, you're doing just fine.

20:45.997 --> 20:47.630
Okay, try using one foot,
not two,

20:47.632 --> 20:50.250
and, uh, just relax.

20:50.252 --> 20:51.867
Take it smooth.
Don't overthink it.

20:51.869 --> 20:52.886
Here we go.

20:52.888 --> 20:54.087
Okay.

20:57.041 --> 20:59.976
- See? Huh?
- Yeah.

20:59.978 --> 21:01.227
Perfect.

21:02.814 --> 21:04.731
Whoa, whoa. Let's keep it
in between the lines.

21:04.733 --> 21:07.049
There we go. That's...

If this "Sergei" has anything
even remotely useful to offer,

22:18.956 --> 22:20.289
I'll call.

22:20.291 --> 22:22.809
Yo, Cass, wait.

22:22.811 --> 22:26.012
Are you sure you wanna
handle this alone?

22:29.484 --> 22:30.600
I, uh...

22:30.602 --> 22:32.902
I feel the need
to do something.

22:32.904 --> 22:34.303
And I think Dean's right.

22:34.305 --> 22:37.273
We can't afford to overlook
any possibility.

22:40.578 --> 22:45.331
He seems to be taking this
particularly hard.

22:48.653 --> 22:51.921
Yeah, yeah.

22:51.923 --> 22:53.289
Yeah, he -- he, uh,

22:53.291 --> 22:57.710
was pretty rough on Jack
at the beginning, and...

22:57.712 --> 23:00.996
I don't think
he's forgotten.

23:00.998 --> 23:05.218
And I know
he hasn't forgiven himself.

23:05.220 --> 23:08.805
You know, he's lost people,
we've all lost people,

23:08.807 --> 23:09.839
but, um...

23:09.841 --> 23:11.441
This feels different.

23:16.347 --> 23:19.348
Losing, um...

23:19.350 --> 23:23.536
a son...

23:23.538 --> 23:25.121
feels different.

23:50.148 --> 23:51.514
I can drive.

23:53.735 --> 23:55.935
Yeah, you can.

23:55.937 --> 23:58.354
No, for real.
I'm a driver.

23:58.356 --> 24:03.076
Yeah, born with
the wheel in your hand, right?

24:03.078 --> 24:05.445
All right, so what do
you want to do next?

24:05.447 --> 24:07.730
I know of a bar near here,
little low on class,

24:07.732 --> 24:09.916
but high
on hook-up potential.

24:09.918 --> 24:12.251
Personally, I've never
missed at this place. Hm?

24:12.253 --> 24:16.089
Actually,
I've kind of got an idea.

24:42.484 --> 24:43.783
Hey.

24:43.785 --> 24:45.434
Yeah?

24:45.436 --> 24:47.436
Frank Kellogg?

24:47.438 --> 24:49.271
Do I know you?

24:49.273 --> 24:52.942
Um, I just wanted to talk to you
for a couple of minutes

24:52.944 --> 24:55.294
about the night
you came over to my house.

24:55.296 --> 24:57.947
Pal,
I been to a lot of houses.

24:57.949 --> 25:00.416
Yeah, but this was
in Pike Creek.

25:00.418 --> 25:05.054
When you were a cop.
Nine years ago.

25:05.056 --> 25:06.506
I don't remember you.

25:06.508 --> 25:08.758
No, I wasn't there.
Um...

25:08.760 --> 25:11.293
My wife and my son
were there.

25:11.295 --> 25:13.012
Alone.

25:14.015 --> 25:15.731
Until you showed up.

25:23.358 --> 25:25.274
So let's talk.

25:42.435 --> 25:44.818
Well, bait and beer.

25:44.820 --> 25:47.288
You are a cheap date.

25:47.290 --> 25:50.441
This certainly isn't Tahiti.

25:50.443 --> 25:54.812
You once told me you and your
father did the exact same thing.

25:54.814 --> 25:57.882
It was your happiest memory
of him.

25:57.884 --> 26:00.150
I didn't say <i>that.</i>

26:00.152 --> 26:02.853
It was how you said it.

26:02.855 --> 26:04.688
I could tell.

26:09.228 --> 26:12.763
I guess my point is that...

26:12.765 --> 26:16.133
if I don't make it...

26:16.135 --> 26:20.854
The stuff I'd miss -- it
wouldn't be things like Tahiti.

26:20.856 --> 26:24.108
Or the Taj Mahal.

26:26.746 --> 26:29.747
I'd miss more time
with you.

26:29.749 --> 26:35.536
I'm getting that life isn't all
these big, amazing moments.

26:35.538 --> 26:37.871
It's time together
that matters.

26:41.160 --> 26:43.010
Like this.

26:45.548 --> 26:46.931
Well, who'd have thought
hanging out with me

26:46.933 --> 26:48.599
would make you
sentimental?

26:54.673 --> 26:57.441
I've had a good life,
Dean.

27:16.212 --> 27:17.578
Sergei?

27:23.336 --> 27:24.501
Sergei?!

27:35.398 --> 27:38.148
The angel Castiel?

27:38.150 --> 27:39.350
And who else?

27:39.352 --> 27:42.186
Do you see anyone else?

27:42.188 --> 27:45.239
Is the Holy Fire
really necessary?

27:45.241 --> 27:49.026
Self-preservation makes
many things necessary.

27:51.747 --> 27:53.447
Please, sit.

28:03.009 --> 28:05.909
As for
my curriculum vitae,

28:05.911 --> 28:08.045
I'm passionately
peripatetic.

28:08.047 --> 28:09.346
No roots.

28:09.348 --> 28:12.416
I've re-crossed the globe
many, many times over.

28:12.418 --> 28:16.086
Studying and observing
the skills of myriad witches,

28:16.088 --> 28:19.139
and seers, holy men,
et cetera.

28:21.143 --> 28:25.279
And what is it
exactly you do?

28:25.281 --> 28:28.065
Answer
the unanswerable.

28:28.067 --> 28:29.316
No.

28:29.318 --> 28:31.568
Know the unknowable.

28:32.738 --> 28:37.491
And I am first and foremost
a healer.

28:39.628 --> 28:42.279
And you know Ketch?

28:42.281 --> 28:43.797
We've never met
face-to-face,

28:43.799 --> 28:47.718
but -- our reputations
are mutually stellar.

28:49.255 --> 28:51.839
I wouldn't call Ketch
"stellar."

28:51.841 --> 28:55.175
Then you have met him.

28:59.398 --> 29:01.265
But -- back to this nephilim

29:01.267 --> 29:02.483
you've been fostering...

29:02.485 --> 29:04.268
Jack.

29:04.270 --> 29:06.437
His name is Jack.

29:06.439 --> 29:10.524
Well, "Jack" is in
a pretty pickle.

29:10.526 --> 29:14.811
If what you're telling me is
right, his condition is dire.

29:14.813 --> 29:18.365
Do you think
it's reversible?

29:18.367 --> 29:21.668
Not as such, but...

29:21.670 --> 29:24.922
it can be shocked out
of its progression

29:24.924 --> 29:27.157
by a recharging agent.

29:27.159 --> 29:31.211
Think of it like you're,
uh, rebooting a computer.

29:31.213 --> 29:34.431
And where would one find
such a thing?

29:34.433 --> 29:38.469
First and foremost,
a healer.

29:41.724 --> 29:44.391
And...

29:53.852 --> 29:55.953
Archangel grace?

29:55.955 --> 29:58.956
Vintage. From Gabriel.

29:58.958 --> 30:02.526
In trade for my home-brewed
cloaking spell.

30:02.528 --> 30:04.294
He used it to hide away
in Monte Carlo.

30:04.296 --> 30:07.080
With porn stars,
yes, I know the story.

30:08.300 --> 30:11.185
But this alone
won't do the trick.

30:13.222 --> 30:15.439
It must be administered

30:15.441 --> 30:20.060
along with the precise
recitation of a spell.

30:26.452 --> 30:30.353
And what is all this
going to cost?

30:30.355 --> 30:32.906
Don't insult me.

30:32.908 --> 30:34.291
I never take money.

30:34.293 --> 30:37.077
My skills are exclusively
for barter.

30:38.214 --> 30:40.247
Then what is it
that you want?

30:41.750 --> 30:43.584
I don't know.

30:46.538 --> 30:49.039
But...

30:49.041 --> 30:52.059
tell the Winchesters
they owe me.

30:56.715 --> 31:01.401
Well, Frank, how long
you gonna hold out, man?

31:03.856 --> 31:05.189
Nick...

31:05.191 --> 31:07.191
I don't even know what
you're talking about.

31:07.193 --> 31:09.576
Really?

31:09.578 --> 31:11.078
Okay, um, well,

31:11.080 --> 31:14.531
let me just lay the scenario
out for you one more time.

31:14.533 --> 31:16.667
My ex-neighbor, Arty,

31:16.669 --> 31:19.569
said he saw someone
coming out of my house

31:19.571 --> 31:21.455
the night of the murder,
right?

31:21.457 --> 31:23.373
And then he changed his mind.

31:23.375 --> 31:25.008
I didn't --
I didn't buy it...

31:26.262 --> 31:27.961
...but, uh, he stuck
to story number two

31:27.963 --> 31:29.579
till I came along.

31:35.137 --> 31:37.754
Paid him a visit.

31:37.756 --> 31:41.091
I was very,
very persuasive.

31:44.446 --> 31:46.429
You saw somebody leave
my house, didn't you?

31:46.431 --> 31:48.565
Didn't you?!
It was a cop.

31:48.567 --> 31:52.819
So, Arty said when he
told the cops what he saw,

31:52.821 --> 31:54.604
they threatened him.

31:54.606 --> 31:57.374
They said, "Keep
your mouth shut or else."

31:57.376 --> 31:59.576
It was like those, uh --

31:59.578 --> 32:02.629
what do you call it --
cover up...

32:02.631 --> 32:04.447
like they were protecting
one of their own.

32:04.449 --> 32:07.584
What does any of this
have to do with me?

32:09.555 --> 32:12.806
Glad you asked, buddy.

32:12.808 --> 32:16.426
I got in contact

32:16.428 --> 32:18.679
with the reporter,

32:18.681 --> 32:21.631
and she gave me the name
of the beat cop

32:21.633 --> 32:22.966
in our neighborhood,
yeah,

32:22.968 --> 32:24.234
a guy she couldn't interview

32:24.236 --> 32:26.520
'cause he left town
after the murders.

32:30.276 --> 32:32.025
See where I'm going
with this?

32:35.948 --> 32:38.949
I -- Look, I don't know
what happened that night,

32:38.951 --> 32:40.250
I -- I --

32:40.252 --> 32:42.669
Y-Your wife

32:42.671 --> 32:44.237
called the precinct.

32:44.239 --> 32:45.706
Thought she heard
a prowler.

32:49.528 --> 32:51.128
And...?

32:52.364 --> 32:54.798
I'm walking up
the front path,

32:54.800 --> 32:56.383
no back-up,

32:56.385 --> 32:59.086
and suddenly from outta nowhere,
there's this guy.

32:59.088 --> 33:01.638
There's this "guy."

33:01.640 --> 33:04.391
He said his name
was "Abraxas."

33:04.393 --> 33:05.892
Abraxas.

33:05.894 --> 33:08.011
The next thing I know,
I'm back in the patrol car,

33:08.013 --> 33:11.064
and I'm --
I'm covered in blood.

33:11.066 --> 33:13.150
My wife's blood.

33:15.854 --> 33:19.656
And my baby's blood.

33:22.945 --> 33:24.528
"Abraxas."

33:27.166 --> 33:29.750
I know that name.

33:30.786 --> 33:32.869
Lucifer knew that name.

33:32.871 --> 33:36.256
Now, this -- this is crazy.

33:36.258 --> 33:38.041
I was outta my head
that night!

33:38.043 --> 33:41.178
I -- I wouldn't
kill anyone.

33:41.180 --> 33:43.046
I know.

33:46.935 --> 33:49.686
I know.
You were possessed.

33:49.688 --> 33:50.687
What?

33:50.689 --> 33:53.557
You were possessed.

33:54.810 --> 33:58.562
Yeah, this -- this --
all this, it's not your fault.

34:10.993 --> 34:14.411
But this was the hand
that murdered my family.

34:16.748 --> 34:21.967
And even if it
wasn't <i>you --</i>

34:21.969 --> 34:23.637
it was still <i>you.</i>

34:25.556 --> 34:28.257
I can't let that slide.

34:29.094 --> 34:30.342
No.

34:30.344 --> 34:32.462
No, please.

34:32.464 --> 34:34.898
Please. No.

34:34.900 --> 34:35.899
No.

34:35.900 --> 34:37.184
Yeah.

34:37.186 --> 34:38.935
Please.

34:41.857 --> 34:44.107
I'm sorry, Frank.

34:44.109 --> 34:46.076
No.

34:46.078 --> 34:47.494
No!

35:24.369 --> 35:26.670
This Sergei was legit.

35:26.672 --> 35:30.174
I mean, he was definitely odd,
but he seemed honest.

35:31.761 --> 35:34.544
So, we're still not certain
this is gonna work?

35:34.546 --> 35:36.980
No, we're not certain,
but...

35:38.717 --> 35:41.051
Gentlemen?

35:42.888 --> 35:44.988
Are you ready, Jack?

35:52.364 --> 35:55.165
Yes.

36:02.258 --> 36:05.709
All right. Here you go.

36:13.552 --> 36:17.271
Potione hac,
restitutus Eris.

36:17.273 --> 36:20.057
Omnia erunt sicut erant!

36:55.177 --> 36:57.010
Something.

36:57.012 --> 36:58.929
Something good?

37:01.133 --> 37:02.316
I think so.

37:06.689 --> 37:08.772
Definite improvement.

37:08.774 --> 37:10.824
- That's great.
- Mm.

37:10.826 --> 37:14.361
Yeah.

37:14.363 --> 37:16.947
Jack?

37:16.949 --> 37:18.532
Did you say
the words right?

37:18.534 --> 37:20.284
I did!

37:23.122 --> 37:24.654
- Jack.
- Jack!

37:24.656 --> 37:26.089
Say them again!

37:26.091 --> 37:27.875
Of course we followed
the instructions,

37:27.877 --> 37:31.178
and Rowena performed the spell
exactly as written,

37:31.180 --> 37:33.163
<i>but he is worse.</i>

37:33.165 --> 37:35.098
<i>He's much worse.</i>

37:35.100 --> 37:36.550
You need to come at once.

37:36.552 --> 37:40.387
I am a shaman. I realign
the harmonics of the universe.

37:40.389 --> 37:42.105
I don't make house calls.

37:42.107 --> 37:44.558
Jack isn't just
another sick kid.

37:44.560 --> 37:48.395
This is the son of an archangel
of the Lord,

37:48.397 --> 37:53.650
who is much more ill now
because of your "harmonics."

37:53.652 --> 37:56.536
And?

37:56.538 --> 38:01.041
Science is sometimes
trial and error.

38:01.043 --> 38:04.328
<i>Victory through</i>
<i>experimentation.</i>

38:04.330 --> 38:07.714
This was an experiment?

38:07.716 --> 38:09.249
You never said that.

38:10.302 --> 38:15.339
If Jack dies,
I will find you.

38:15.341 --> 38:18.392
You can try.

38:36.946 --> 38:40.364
All right...

38:40.366 --> 38:41.898
I'm not very good
at this,

38:41.900 --> 38:46.736
but the priest said
it would help, so, um...

38:46.738 --> 38:48.755
I'm gonna try.

38:51.043 --> 38:54.594
I say that I do
the terrible things I do

38:54.596 --> 38:58.465
because I couldn't find
who killed Sarah and Teddy.

39:01.253 --> 39:04.304
And that once I did,
I'd be free of this darkness

39:04.306 --> 39:06.690
and this rage...

39:08.927 --> 39:11.361
...but I lied.

39:13.649 --> 39:16.199
Truth is...

39:20.706 --> 39:25.108
...I like
doing these things,

39:25.110 --> 39:27.494
and I don't want to stop.

39:32.918 --> 39:36.586
I'm bonded to you
and what you are.

39:36.588 --> 39:38.621
I mean, it's -- it's --

39:38.623 --> 39:40.757
It's how you
first found me.

39:45.147 --> 39:48.148
I don't know who I am

39:48.150 --> 39:49.766
if I'm not you.

39:51.470 --> 39:52.652
No consequences.

39:52.654 --> 39:54.905
No pain. No sorrow.

39:54.907 --> 39:57.324
I want that back.

39:57.326 --> 40:00.827
I want it back.

40:00.829 --> 40:04.031
I don't want to feel now
what I didn't feel then.

40:06.335 --> 40:07.784
Where are you?

40:09.621 --> 40:11.254
Where are you?

40:13.825 --> 40:15.292
Help me.

40:15.294 --> 40:18.095
Help me.

40:24.553 --> 40:27.471
I shouldn't have done it.
I shouldn't have taken him out.

40:27.473 --> 40:29.356
It was what he wanted.

40:29.358 --> 40:32.509
I mean, we knew he was gonna
get worse, regardless.

40:32.511 --> 40:33.894
Yeah, but it was too risky.

40:33.896 --> 40:38.365
Yeah, but, Dean, life,
all of it, is a risk.

40:38.367 --> 40:39.733
Jack knew that.

40:39.735 --> 40:41.351
Possim rei huius
cognoscere causas...

40:41.353 --> 40:43.787
- And you made him happy.
- Mm.

40:43.789 --> 40:46.289
You did more for him
than any of us.

40:55.751 --> 40:58.085
So, what can we do?

41:01.757 --> 41:03.640
Watch over him.

41:03.642 --> 41:06.343
Stay by his side...

41:06.345 --> 41:08.929
as he dies.
