something would happen to him...

00:35.036 --> 00:37.169

Brother and sister...

01:46.440 --> 01:49.041
Riley and I are
brother and sister now.

01:49.043 --> 01:50.142
What does that even mean?

01:51.479 --> 01:53.445
What does anything mean
out the mouth of a girl?

01:53.447 --> 01:55.547
I mean, I used to
tell vanessa, clear as day,

01:55.549 --> 01:57.449
"vanessa, I'd buy
you a house,

01:57.451 --> 01:59.952
"and I'd be yours forever,
and I'd buy you ice cream,"

01:59.954 --> 02:01.153
You know what'd she say?

02:01.155 --> 02:02.621
"I don't want you
to buy me a house,

02:02.623 --> 02:05.724
"I don't want your ice cream,
and I don't like you."

02:05.726 --> 02:08.127
How am I supposed
to understand that?

02:08.129 --> 02:09.328
I understand it.

02:13.801 --> 02:16.969
Whoa. Gentlemen,
look how lucky you are.

02:18.572 --> 02:20.105
You treat 'em right.

02:20.107 --> 02:21.673
Thank you, pappy joe.

02:21.675 --> 02:25.477
I see why you get homesick
for texas sometimes, lucas.

02:26.680 --> 02:29.248
I never knew that
the sky had this many stars.

02:30.518 --> 02:32.951
You know what else?
I don't get nervous

02:32.953 --> 02:34.653
When I'm with you anymore.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.622
We're doing the right thing.

02:36.624 --> 02:37.856
Ah.

02:37.858 --> 02:40.359
Remember when we couldn't
even say "hi" to each other?

02:40.361 --> 02:43.662
Remember how
we'd go, "hi."

02:43.664 --> 02:46.131
"howdy." "hi."
remember?

02:46.133 --> 02:47.799
Now watch this.
Say "hi" to me.

02:47.801 --> 02:49.334
-Hi.
-Hi, lucas.

02:49.336 --> 02:51.537
What up, brah?
What's up with you, man?

02:51.539 --> 02:53.038
You good? You cool?

02:54.508 --> 02:55.707
Hi.

02:55.709 --> 02:58.110
Still got some
catching up to do.

02:58.112 --> 02:59.978
Riley, I-- I don't even
know what's going on right now.

02:59.980 --> 03:01.480
What's going on
is that we're gonna

03:01.482 --> 03:03.882
Be the best of friends
and care about

03:03.884 --> 03:06.552
What each of us has to say
for the rest of our lives.

03:06.554 --> 03:08.554
Yeah, I sort of
thought we had that.

03:08.556 --> 03:09.688
What does brother
and sister mean?

03:09.690 --> 03:11.857
It means... You know...

03:11.859 --> 03:13.058
-Poom!
-Hey!

03:13.060 --> 03:14.560
-Ping!
-Riley!

03:14.562 --> 03:16.628
Ha, you said that
just like a brother would.

03:16.630 --> 03:18.030
-Well, can I hit you back?
-No.

03:18.032 --> 03:19.698
-Only you get to hit me?
-Mm-hmm.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.700
We're just like
how you and maya were.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.971
Ha-hee.

03:27.641 --> 03:28.840
You don't even do it right.

03:28.842 --> 03:32.544
Oh! Maya,
I thought you weren't
talking to lucas.

03:32.546 --> 03:33.912
I'm not talking to him.

03:33.914 --> 03:35.013
I'm talking to you.

03:35.015 --> 03:37.216
Maya, are you seriously
not gonna talk to me?

03:37.218 --> 03:41.053
You could've gotten hurt
on that stupid bull.

03:42.389 --> 03:43.755
What do you think
you getting hurt

03:43.757 --> 03:45.724
Would have done
to the people who...

03:47.094 --> 03:48.894
Care about you?

03:48.896 --> 03:50.495
I think you were
gonna say "care about you."

03:50.497 --> 03:52.397
I'm not talking about me.
You think I'm talking about me?

03:52.399 --> 03:54.600
-Yes, I do.
-I'm talking
about everybody here.

03:54.602 --> 03:55.400
All right.

03:55.402 --> 03:57.569
Maya, lucas is okay.

03:57.571 --> 03:58.537
He didn't get hurt.

03:58.539 --> 04:00.105
All of us are okay.

04:01.175 --> 04:03.542
And we're gonna go spend
our first night in texas...

04:03.544 --> 04:04.776
What should we do?

04:04.778 --> 04:06.044
I've been reading
about austin,

04:06.046 --> 04:07.279
And they call it
a music city.

04:07.281 --> 04:08.914
They call it the live
music capital of the world.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.515
That's absolutely
what we should do.

04:10.517 --> 04:12.417
Show them the town
and listen to some music.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.553
Yeah! Anyone good
playing tonight?

04:14.555 --> 04:17.623
If I was a young buck
trying to impress my friends,

04:17.625 --> 04:21.526
I might suggest
chubby's famous barbecue pit.

04:21.528 --> 04:24.129
Always good eats,
always good music.

04:24.131 --> 04:25.931
But barbecued foods
aren't good for you.

04:34.808 --> 04:37.476
Let me tell you
what ain't good for you.

04:37.478 --> 04:38.644
You're not gonna do
anything to me

04:38.646 --> 04:40.612
Because you know
I'm a new york intellectual

04:40.614 --> 04:42.481
And you don't want
to be a cliche.

04:44.652 --> 04:47.119
Lucas, fetch me my shotgun.

04:47.121 --> 04:49.488
-Okay.
-Lucas!

04:49.490 --> 04:50.555
Okay.

04:52.593 --> 04:55.661
Okay, I'll go to chubby's,
I'll eat your food,

04:55.663 --> 04:57.229
I'll listen to your music,

04:57.231 --> 05:00.165
But don't expect
a changed farkle, hombre.

05:06.173 --> 05:07.506
Coming with us?

05:07.508 --> 05:09.274
Appreciate the invite.

05:09.276 --> 05:10.742
I'm extremely busy...

05:15.182 --> 05:17.649
As I found...

05:17.651 --> 05:19.518
This chair won't rock itself.

05:23.490 --> 05:25.157
(country music plays)

05:27.661 --> 05:31.163
While I understand barbecue
is not your thing, farkle,

05:31.165 --> 05:32.664
You do seem
to have found

05:32.666 --> 05:35.567
A new appreciation
for our hometown cuisine.

05:37.638 --> 05:39.171
More.

05:40.774 --> 05:43.709
Easy, cowboy.
You need to calm down.

05:43.711 --> 05:45.110
Oh, I have to calm down?

05:45.112 --> 05:47.979
They make a big deal
out of you riding a bull
for four seconds.

05:47.981 --> 05:49.681
Well, I ate him.

05:55.989 --> 05:57.723
Riley:
Maya...

05:57.725 --> 05:59.691
Will you please
say something to him?

05:59.693 --> 06:02.160
I know that you care
about him. It's okay.

06:02.162 --> 06:04.596
I just don't want
anything to change.

06:05.532 --> 06:08.033
Hey, huckleberry...

06:08.035 --> 06:09.234
Are we dancing or what?

06:09.236 --> 06:11.636
Oh, we can do that?
Is that part of the new rules?

06:11.638 --> 06:12.971
This kind of dancing? Sure.

06:19.413 --> 06:21.313
-Maya, what's
going on with you?
-I don't know.

06:22.649 --> 06:24.750
Do you know? 'cause...

06:24.752 --> 06:26.585
Help me.

06:37.398 --> 06:39.731
-Oh, you've done this before?
-Never.

06:39.733 --> 06:40.732
Then how are you so good?

06:40.734 --> 06:42.701
Because I'm finally
relaxed with you.

06:42.703 --> 06:44.669
I'm not sure
that's good news.

06:44.671 --> 06:46.405
It is, lucas.

06:46.407 --> 06:48.407
I had no idea
I would be in texas

06:48.409 --> 06:51.543
Just like I had no idea
I would ever dance
with a rodeo star.

06:51.545 --> 06:53.578
The only thing I know
is that I always want

06:53.580 --> 06:54.713
To be able
to talk to you,

06:54.715 --> 06:56.615
And maybe that this
is the best way to do that.

06:56.617 --> 06:59.684
If that's what you want.

06:59.686 --> 07:01.019
You know what I don't want?

07:01.021 --> 07:03.722
I don't want
to go out for a while

07:03.724 --> 07:06.625
And break up
and not like each other anymore.

07:06.627 --> 07:08.393
Isn't that
what happens next?

07:08.395 --> 07:10.295
Isn't that what people do?

07:10.297 --> 07:12.431
I don't
understand that, lucas.

07:12.433 --> 07:15.100
I always want
you around and...

07:15.102 --> 07:16.802
Maybe the best way
to do that is

07:16.804 --> 07:18.303
To be like brother and sister.

07:26.713 --> 07:28.613
You didn't want
him to get hurt
because you care about him.

07:28.615 --> 07:30.282
-I care about all of us.
-You care about him.

07:30.284 --> 07:31.650
-I care about all of us.
-You care about him.

07:31.652 --> 07:33.251
I will kill you.

07:33.253 --> 07:34.886
I'm not gonna
care about anybody

07:34.888 --> 07:36.321
For the rest
of my life, all right?

07:36.323 --> 07:38.457
I tried it once.
Didn't work.

07:38.459 --> 07:40.559
From now on,
I like nobody.

07:40.561 --> 07:41.993
Zay?

07:41.995 --> 07:43.562
Unbelievable.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.498
How's new york
been treating you?

07:46.500 --> 07:47.966
Good, yeah.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.334
Just trying to fit in.

07:49.336 --> 07:50.435
Making new friends...

07:50.437 --> 07:52.637
Well, looks like
you made some.

07:52.639 --> 07:53.805
Wanna introduce me?

07:54.908 --> 07:56.741
Yeah. Um, this is farkle...

07:56.743 --> 07:58.310
Texas lady.

07:58.312 --> 07:59.978
And this is my friend, maya.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.680
You did not just do that.

08:01.682 --> 08:02.948
What?

08:02.950 --> 08:06.985
You did not just introduce
your girlfriend as your friend.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.854
(scoffs)
what?

08:08.856 --> 08:10.755
Isaiah earl babineaux...

08:10.757 --> 08:12.691
Your middle name is earl?

08:12.693 --> 08:17.362
-No.
-The next time you introduce
your girlfriend as your friend,

08:17.364 --> 08:19.331
We are through.
Do you hear me?

08:19.333 --> 08:22.367
I mean, I hear you, but I...

08:22.369 --> 08:24.336
Put your arm around me.

08:24.338 --> 08:26.037
Twirl my hair.

08:27.774 --> 08:29.608
Call me honey nugget.

08:29.610 --> 08:30.942
Hi, honey nugget.

08:30.944 --> 08:32.511
Hi, hunkalicious.

08:34.515 --> 08:35.780
Vanessa?

08:35.782 --> 08:37.849
Vanessa.

08:38.886 --> 08:40.785
A little possessive, no?

08:40.787 --> 08:42.854
Well, the good ones
you don't let get away,

08:42.856 --> 08:44.322
You know what I mean?

08:44.324 --> 08:46.825
With all the girls chasing
him around new york city,

08:46.827 --> 08:49.594
You have to
swoop right in
or he'll be gone.

08:50.697 --> 08:54.032
I said, "you have to
swoop right in or he will"--

08:54.034 --> 08:55.967
Isaiah hank babineaux.

08:55.969 --> 08:58.703
-No--
-I don't care.

08:58.705 --> 09:01.373
I only care that
you don't let maya get

09:01.375 --> 09:03.408
Her hooks into you
when you know you are mine.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.745
This is my friend, riley--

09:06.747 --> 09:08.880
Now, how do you like it
when he calls you
a friend, riley?

09:08.882 --> 09:10.649
-I like it.
-No, you do not like it.

09:10.651 --> 09:13.251
I do not like
when you call me just "friend."

09:13.253 --> 09:15.687
Well, what would you like
for me to call you?

09:15.689 --> 09:18.490
I would like for
you to call me...

09:18.492 --> 09:21.092
Cotton candy face.

09:21.094 --> 09:23.361
Good girl.
I know that was hard.

09:23.363 --> 09:26.364
Zay, is it possible
I've misjudged you?

09:26.366 --> 09:28.033
It's possible, vanessa.

09:28.035 --> 09:30.168
-How do you know my name?
-Um...

09:30.170 --> 09:31.202
-Too much.
-Too much.

09:31.204 --> 09:32.270
-Too much.
-Too much.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.374
Hey, everybody.
Welcome to chubby's
famous barbecue,

09:36.376 --> 09:37.776
Home of the best
ribs in texas.

09:37.778 --> 09:39.010
(cheers and applause)

09:39.012 --> 09:40.845
I grew up here!

09:40.847 --> 09:42.581
Okay, well we're about
to introduce two lovely ladies

09:42.583 --> 09:43.848
And one of them
grew up here as well,

09:43.850 --> 09:45.517
About two hours down
the road in sugar land.

09:45.519 --> 09:46.952
Ladies and gentlemen,
please help me welcome

09:46.954 --> 09:48.720
Maddie & tae!

09:48.722 --> 09:50.255
(cheers and applause)

09:51.925 --> 09:54.759
Well, it feels real good
to be back home in texas.

09:54.761 --> 09:56.595
This first one's a love song...

09:56.597 --> 09:58.363
All:
Uh-oh.

09:58.365 --> 10:00.231
And it's called
<i>no place like you.</i>

(chuckles)

12:26.947 --> 12:28.947
You've just been
sitting here, pappy joe?

12:28.949 --> 12:31.015
Oh, after you run
around enough,

12:31.017 --> 12:32.584
You'll find that
a comfy chair

12:32.586 --> 12:35.386
On your own front porch
is your favorite destination.

12:35.388 --> 12:37.856
Oh, by the way...

12:42.763 --> 12:45.797
Lord chesterfield's
letters to his son.

12:45.799 --> 12:47.132
What?

12:47.134 --> 12:50.135
Lord chesterfield had a son
who traveled the world.

12:50.137 --> 12:51.469
What is that?
What are you doing?

12:51.471 --> 12:52.604
It's a blackboard.

12:52.606 --> 12:54.539
My daddy made you do this.

12:54.541 --> 12:56.141
-He's good people.
-No, he's not.

12:57.144 --> 12:59.878
Chesterfield writes
him letters about

12:59.880 --> 13:01.813
How he should
behave himself

13:01.815 --> 13:03.915
Because a father knows...

13:03.917 --> 13:07.218
The only way for a kid
to really learn anything

13:07.220 --> 13:08.486
Is to go out
into the world

13:08.488 --> 13:09.954
And find out who he is.

13:09.956 --> 13:12.724
My daddy is trying to teach
us from beyond the grave.

13:12.726 --> 13:14.959
Matthews wrote
us a letter, didn't he?

13:14.961 --> 13:16.094
He did.

13:16.096 --> 13:17.228
(chuckles)

13:19.900 --> 13:21.800
"dear my favorite children...

13:23.170 --> 13:26.671
"take care of each other.
Enjoy the world."

13:27.841 --> 13:29.407
I don't want
this night to end.

13:32.612 --> 13:34.345
What do you do around here
when you just want to look

13:34.347 --> 13:35.914
At each other's faces
a little longer?

13:42.589 --> 13:44.355
Please do me
the great favor

13:44.357 --> 13:47.792
Of dousing these embers
real good when you're done.

13:47.794 --> 13:49.961
That house and me
might be real old,

13:49.963 --> 13:52.096
But we ain't quite
ready to burned down yet.

13:53.600 --> 13:56.634
Well, I never
thought I'd say
anything like this, but...

13:56.636 --> 13:59.037
I'm real sad I don't
have a pappy joe of my own.

13:59.039 --> 14:01.005
Thank you, maya.

14:01.007 --> 14:03.041
I wish you'd
consider me yours

14:03.043 --> 14:06.377
Till the time I...
I... You know... Bleh.

14:07.848 --> 14:09.047
Okay.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.051
You guys were lucky.

14:13.053 --> 14:14.018
How come?

14:14.020 --> 14:16.221
To grow up out here...

14:16.223 --> 14:18.189
To have this sky...

14:18.191 --> 14:20.124
And the stars...

14:21.828 --> 14:23.862
This has been the best
weekend of my life.

14:23.864 --> 14:25.063
Thank you.

14:26.299 --> 14:28.032
Promise we'll always
be friends no matter what.

14:28.034 --> 14:30.368
-Riley...
-Promise.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.370
No matter what happens,
I am telling you

14:32.372 --> 14:34.572
That I will always
be your best friend.
No matter what.

14:34.574 --> 14:36.074
Oh.

14:37.043 --> 14:38.910
There's nothing I could do--

14:38.912 --> 14:41.179
No, there's nothing
you could do, maya.

14:41.181 --> 14:42.780
Do you understand?

14:44.017 --> 14:46.351
It's you and me
until the time we...

14:46.353 --> 14:48.353
You know...

14:48.355 --> 14:49.454
Both:
Bleh.

14:51.892 --> 14:53.892
-Zay.
-Vanessa?

14:53.894 --> 14:56.261
Pappy joe told me
you were out here.

14:56.263 --> 14:57.495
You were looking for me?

14:57.497 --> 15:00.231
I wanted to tell
you I was sorry.

15:00.233 --> 15:03.768
-What'd you do?
-I never really
gave you a chance.

15:03.770 --> 15:06.070
Now I'm too late
because I could never

15:06.072 --> 15:08.940
Steal you away
from your new friends...

15:08.942 --> 15:10.308
Could I?

15:14.114 --> 15:15.580
Steal me from these people?

15:16.683 --> 15:18.082
Hmph.

15:18.084 --> 15:20.885
No. No, you couldn't.

15:20.887 --> 15:22.687
What if I bought you ice cream?

15:22.689 --> 15:24.122
(sighs)

15:24.124 --> 15:25.757
You know, vanessa...

15:25.759 --> 15:29.294
They're not really
both my girlfriends.

15:31.031 --> 15:32.563
Or either of 'em.

15:32.565 --> 15:34.098
I think I knew that.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.200
That's not what impressed me.

15:36.202 --> 15:38.436
They're your friends
who stuck up for you,

15:38.438 --> 15:41.039
So I must have
missed something...

15:41.041 --> 15:43.074
Or you must have changed.

15:43.076 --> 15:46.210
Well, I've learned
that people change people.

15:46.212 --> 15:48.980
Hm, from beyond the grave,
he's teaching us.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.150
We're breaking up
with you, honey nugget.

15:52.152 --> 15:54.319
Let her buy you ice cream.

15:56.256 --> 15:59.223
Vanessa, you made
a mistake with this one.

15:59.225 --> 16:00.558
He's pretty wonderful.

16:00.560 --> 16:03.027
Well, let's go see.

16:15.308 --> 16:16.908
Do you want me to buy
you ice cream, farkle?

16:16.910 --> 16:17.976
What?

16:17.978 --> 16:20.345
Do you want me to
buy you ice cream?

16:20.347 --> 16:22.280
-Oh. Are you sure?
-Yeah. Let's go.

16:22.282 --> 16:23.982
Riles, where are you going?

16:25.485 --> 16:27.986
You need to feel
whatever you feel, maya.

16:29.589 --> 16:31.622
It's you and me forever.

16:31.624 --> 16:35.360
There is nothing that
you could ever do
to change that.

16:44.304 --> 16:46.037
-Maya likes you.
-Riley!

16:46.039 --> 16:47.705
She's been hiding
it all this time.

16:47.707 --> 16:49.307
That's why she couldn't
watch you at the rodeo.

16:49.309 --> 16:50.541
What are you doing?

16:50.543 --> 16:52.043
I saw you, maya.

16:52.045 --> 16:54.379
I saw how much you cared.

16:57.183 --> 16:59.550
It's why she makes
fun of you, I think.

16:59.552 --> 17:02.320
Riley, what are we?

17:02.322 --> 17:04.155
I told you what we are.

17:04.157 --> 17:05.923
What if that's not
what I think we are?

17:08.294 --> 17:11.796
Well, then you better start
thinking of us like that.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.300
-Riley, I--
-lucas...

17:16.302 --> 17:19.270
We will always be there
for each other.

17:22.008 --> 17:23.408
You stepped back.

17:25.345 --> 17:27.145
I know that you stepped back.

17:36.322 --> 17:37.855
What's going on?

17:37.857 --> 17:40.391
I don't know.

17:41.661 --> 17:43.694
I'm her brother now?

17:43.696 --> 17:45.430
Apparently.

17:48.935 --> 17:51.402
-You like me?
-No.

17:51.404 --> 17:53.838
Maya, why didn't you want
me to ride in the rodeo?

17:56.176 --> 17:58.543
Because I didn't
want you to win

17:58.545 --> 18:00.745
And get all conceited.

18:00.747 --> 18:03.281
I don't think that's it.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.417
(speaking with a drawl)
I don't think that's it.

18:06.419 --> 18:09.053
I don't talk like that.
I just don't.

18:09.055 --> 18:12.123
-Why do you see me like that?
-Of course I don't
see you like that.

18:12.125 --> 18:14.092
Can we just...

18:14.094 --> 18:16.394
Can we just look
at this fire, please?

18:16.396 --> 18:17.662
Yes.

18:24.370 --> 18:25.436
Stop.

18:34.948 --> 18:36.247
Can we just stop?

18:36.249 --> 18:38.416
I just want
everything to stop.

18:38.417 --> 18:40.584
It's been bad enough
I've been keeping this secret
from riley all this time.

18:40.587 --> 18:42.186
What secret?

18:45.325 --> 18:47.325
You guys are so much alike.

18:49.429 --> 18:52.130
I thought you were just like
brother and sister, too.

18:52.132 --> 18:53.197
Why?

18:55.935 --> 18:59.003
You're at your best
when you're just talking
to each other.

18:59.005 --> 19:01.105
Looking out for each other.

19:01.107 --> 19:04.475
That's what I believed,
but I kept it a secret.

19:07.280 --> 19:10.515
And now the secret's out,
so I don't have to carry
it around with me anymore.

19:12.785 --> 19:16.320
I just don't want to have
anymore secrets from her.

19:19.459 --> 19:23.394
So you don't make fun of me
because you like me?

19:26.166 --> 19:27.865
I'm just gonna
watch this fire.

19:27.867 --> 19:30.368
Maya, why do you
make fun of me?

19:31.704 --> 19:34.138
-Because you're easy
to make fun of.
-Okay, then stop.

19:34.140 --> 19:36.340
Because you're a huckleberry.
Because you're a ranger--

19:36.342 --> 19:38.176
-Would you stop?
-Look, if I had
feelings for you,

19:38.178 --> 19:39.877
Don't you think I'd
just come right out and say it?

19:39.879 --> 19:42.246
Well, I don't.
So what I do say is har-har--

19:52.892 --> 19:54.458
Why did you do that?

19:54.460 --> 19:57.261
I don't know. I just...
Wanted you to stop.

19:58.631 --> 20:00.431
Please don't tell my sister.

20:02.835 --> 20:05.002
You couldn't think of
another way to stop me?

20:05.004 --> 20:07.305
Not at the time. No.

20:07.307 --> 20:08.906
I'm sorry.

20:11.477 --> 20:14.879
You don't have to
be sorry, huckleberry.

20:14.881 --> 20:16.714
Of course I like you.

20:18.418 --> 20:19.717
You're a good guy.

20:22.589 --> 20:25.423
If you got hurt,
I don't know what
I would've done.

20:37.570 --> 20:40.004
I don't want to have
any more secrets from her.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.920
I need to talk
to both of you.

20:57.257 --> 20:59.123
You are gentle...

20:59.125 --> 21:02.193
But when I first met you,
I was scared of you.

21:03.396 --> 21:05.029
I never told you that.

21:05.031 --> 21:07.365
You wouldn't think
that someone could be

21:07.367 --> 21:09.734
Scared of you, but...

21:09.736 --> 21:11.469
I was.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.973
And you...

21:15.975 --> 21:18.376
Now, you always scared me.

21:18.378 --> 21:21.812
You gave me nightmares
from the day I first
looked at you.

21:21.814 --> 21:25.549
Then when I found out
that I was gonna have
a chance with you, well...

21:27.120 --> 21:29.487
That was about
the scariest moment
of my life.

21:31.591 --> 21:33.724
Anyway, I...

21:33.726 --> 21:35.626
I want you to know that
you're both an important part

21:35.628 --> 21:37.628
Of my growing up.

21:37.630 --> 21:41.766
I wouldn't be who I am today
without either one of you, so...

21:41.768 --> 21:43.668
Thank you.

21:43.670 --> 21:45.169
But...

21:45.171 --> 21:47.138
You guys are nothing...

21:47.140 --> 21:49.006
Compared to riley and maya.

21:49.008 --> 21:51.509
-(snorts)
-(bleats)

21:57.183 --> 21:58.683
You ready?

21:59.652 --> 22:01.252
Yeah.

22:01.254 --> 22:02.687
Thank you.

22:02.689 --> 22:04.689
For everything.

22:06.125 --> 22:07.925
Good luck in the world, boy.
