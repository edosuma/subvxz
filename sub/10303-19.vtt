01:16.260 --> 01:17.852
<i>Previously on Married with Children:</i>

01:18.100 --> 01:20.614
<i>The family who never feeds me
went on vacation.</i>

01:20.860 --> 01:22.088
Oh, it's not so bad.

01:22.300 --> 01:25.098
<i>No, it's like 20,000 Leagues
Under the Sea.</i>

01:25.580 --> 01:28.697
Except I'm married
to the giant squid.

01:29.780 --> 01:32.499
<i>Exacerbating the situation
was the fact that by day...</i>

01:32.820 --> 01:35.618
<i>...the cruise was geared
towards women who ate like mastiffs.</i>

01:36.140 --> 01:38.051
<i>But by night...</i>

01:39.900 --> 01:42.414
<i>...Al was happy
for a brief moment until--</i>

01:42.660 --> 01:45.128
I can't go out in public like this.

01:45.380 --> 01:48.258
It's all right. No, you can't, sweetheart.
I know you can't--

01:48.500 --> 01:50.695
- Come on, Jefferson.
- You can't go either.

01:50.940 --> 01:52.658
Why? My hair don't look like crap!

01:54.060 --> 01:56.858
<i>And if that shipwreck wasn't enough,
get a load of this one.</i>

01:57.100 --> 02:01.332
- Oh, my God, we're really sinking?
- Oh, come on.

02:01.580 --> 02:04.970
If we were sinking, you think
I could look in this porthole and see...

02:06.020 --> 02:07.692
...fish!

02:07.940 --> 02:11.171
<i>And now back
to Buck, King of All Dogs.</i>

02:11.420 --> 02:14.651
<i>Also known to humans
as Married With Children.</i>

02:27.020 --> 02:30.774
Did I thank you for inviting me
on this cruise, Peg?

02:31.860 --> 02:35.011
Well, as a matter of fact,
you haven't.

02:35.260 --> 02:39.048
Then maybe a simple stake
through the heart would suffice.

02:39.900 --> 02:42.812
All right, look,
this is no time to turn on each other.

02:43.060 --> 02:44.812
We're alone
in the middle of the ocean.

02:45.020 --> 02:47.853
It's a perfect time
to turn on each other.

02:48.380 --> 02:50.052
Why don't you look
on the bright side.

02:50.260 --> 02:54.378
It's a balmy summer day,
we're on vacation.

02:54.580 --> 02:57.731
Well, now we know
who we're going to eat first.

02:59.300 --> 03:01.734
Dibs on the thighs.

03:06.420 --> 03:10.413
Look, you cookie-aisle of a woman.

03:11.140 --> 03:14.177
If you hadn't gnawed
through 12 inches of bulkhead...

03:14.380 --> 03:17.770
...to inhale some jerk chicken,
none of us would be here.

03:18.020 --> 03:21.171
So if anyone's gonna feed
on my husband's dead thighs...

03:21.380 --> 03:23.132
...it's gonna be me.

03:24.060 --> 03:25.971
Thanks, gumdrop.

03:26.220 --> 03:28.017
I can't stand this
for one minute more.

03:28.260 --> 03:31.218
Oh, come on, Al.
It's a perfectly calm sea.

03:31.420 --> 03:34.298
It's not the sea, Peg. It's...

03:34.980 --> 03:36.413
...Gilbert Gottfried.

03:48.780 --> 03:52.090
So I'm on a cruise.
My agent says to me:

03:52.340 --> 03:56.379
"Go on a cruise.
You don't have to follow Sinbad.

03:56.620 --> 03:59.339
And you don't have to follow
Carrot Top.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.974
And you get to eat with the captain."

04:02.220 --> 04:05.815
So am I eating with the captain?
Am I eating?

04:06.060 --> 04:12.249
Am I even on a cruise anymore?
Somebody get my agent!

04:13.180 --> 04:16.297
Somebody get my spear gun.

04:17.740 --> 04:21.289
- I think he's funny.
- Make it two spear guns.

04:22.700 --> 04:25.612
- So, what do we do now?
- We bob around in the sea...

04:25.820 --> 04:29.051
...until the sun bakes us
like cookies.

04:29.580 --> 04:31.332
Cookies?

04:32.300 --> 04:34.814
Quiet, sea hags.

04:35.460 --> 04:38.611
Now, first thing we have to do
is pick a leader.

04:38.860 --> 04:40.532
Who knows the most about the sea?

04:40.780 --> 04:42.850
David Hasselhoff.

04:44.220 --> 04:46.859
Okay, Gilbert's disqualified.

04:47.100 --> 04:50.012
- Anyone else?
- Oh, what difference does it make?

04:50.260 --> 04:55.573
We're just gonna wind up with sea gulls
pecking out our salt-encrusted eyes.

04:55.820 --> 04:58.175
Thank you, Kathy Lee Gifford.

04:59.780 --> 05:02.374
Well, you know, Al really doesn't know
much about the sea.

05:02.580 --> 05:05.936
- So I think we're gonna have to--
- Excuse me, Loch Ness Hairdo.

05:08.300 --> 05:09.733
I know two things about the sea.

05:09.940 --> 05:11.976
Number one, when you flush,
it ends up here.

05:15.980 --> 05:20.098
<i>And two, I watched all 3000 episodes
of Gilligan's Island.</i>

05:20.340 --> 05:24.015
- How do you find the time?
- I don't have sex with you.

05:24.580 --> 05:27.731
All right, then it's decided.
Al's captain.

05:27.980 --> 05:30.050
Well, captain, now what?

05:30.580 --> 05:34.653
Well, as my first official act, I'm
declaring my marriage null and void.

05:36.340 --> 05:39.571
And secondly, I think
we should strike out for land.

05:43.380 --> 05:44.733
Which way is land?

05:44.980 --> 05:47.255
I think it's back there...

05:47.900 --> 05:51.051
Good. Then we're on our way.

05:51.300 --> 05:57.057
Look, this is useless, Al couldn't find
land if he was skydiving.

05:57.540 --> 06:00.259
We're in the hands
of a blithering idiot.

06:00.780 --> 06:03.533
That's Captain Blithering.

06:04.340 --> 06:10.336
Look, perhaps a brief comic interlude
will help lighten the moment.

06:10.580 --> 06:15.210
I hope you can hear my jokes
over the rumbling in my stomach.

06:16.660 --> 06:18.810
Is this thing on?

06:19.660 --> 06:25.132
Right before we went down, I took
a bunch of serving trays as props.

06:25.380 --> 06:28.099
Oh, much better than taking food.

06:28.620 --> 06:31.009
Why couldn't have Gallagher
been the entertainer?

06:31.260 --> 06:34.411
I mean, at least then
we could have had watermelon.

06:34.980 --> 06:37.540
Yeah, like we'd have gotten any.

06:40.460 --> 06:43.816
Well, anyway, Mickey Mouse on acid.

06:45.500 --> 06:49.129
I'm freaking out. Somebody help me.

06:49.380 --> 06:52.452
I'm having a bad trip.

06:54.780 --> 06:58.136
A midget putting a dime
in a payphone.

07:01.180 --> 07:03.136
Clark Gable.

07:03.780 --> 07:06.089
Vincent van Gogh.

07:09.820 --> 07:12.095
Peg, you wanna give this one tug?

07:12.340 --> 07:14.410
Ironside.

07:20.500 --> 07:22.889
No, no. No, Bugs,
don't go into that deserted mine.

07:23.100 --> 07:25.568
Yosemite Sam
just threw dynamite in there.

07:25.820 --> 07:28.573
Oh, God, I hope this is rerun.

07:30.100 --> 07:32.853
God, I hope you marry
someone with money.

07:34.220 --> 07:36.609
Now move over,
I wanna watch the news.

07:37.180 --> 07:39.853
<i>And in close-to-show-biz news,
radio personality...</i>

07:40.060 --> 07:42.255
<i>...and ex-pimple cream spokesman
Wolfman Jack...</i>

07:42.460 --> 07:44.496
<i>...was found bound and gagged
in a dumpster...</i>

07:44.700 --> 07:47.260
<i>...behind Planet Hollywood
last night.</i>

07:54.140 --> 07:59.168
<i>Police found several clues, but instead
opted to go inside where it was warm.</i>

08:00.180 --> 08:03.252
That's the last time
I let you hit someone with a shovel.

08:03.500 --> 08:06.890
<i>In another late-breaking story,
the luxury cruise liner, Sea Dodge...</i>

08:07.100 --> 08:10.934
<i>...went down last night in calm waters
somewhere in the Caribbean.</i>

08:11.180 --> 08:13.057
Kelly, that's the ship
Mom and Dad are on.

08:13.260 --> 08:16.013
<i>The passengers have been
accounted for except one lifeboat...</i>

08:16.220 --> 08:18.609
<i>...purportedly carrying comedian
Gilbert Gottfried...</i>

08:18.820 --> 08:23.177
<i>...and some other people, including
a woman with really silly red hair.</i>

08:24.340 --> 08:30.256
Oh, my God, Gilbert Gottfried
and one of the Judds are lost at sea.

08:32.460 --> 08:35.532
It's not one of the Judds,
you Zagnut.

08:35.860 --> 08:38.658
Kelly, do you know what this means?

08:39.700 --> 08:43.294
Mom and Dad.
Oh, my God, what are we gonna do?

08:43.539 --> 08:47.328
How are we gonna eat?
How are we gonna pay the mortgage?

08:47.580 --> 08:49.616
Our lives are gonna be...

08:49.900 --> 08:51.970
...exactly the same.

08:52.860 --> 08:55.658
We can't just sit here. We gotta get
to the Caribbean somehow.

08:55.860 --> 08:57.134
Okay.

08:57.380 --> 09:00.656
<i>Don't forget to leave
some food for the dog.</i>

09:01.220 --> 09:04.132
- How long are we gonna be gone?
- I don't know. Maybe weeks.

09:04.380 --> 09:07.053
<i>Yo, dog here. Yo.</i>

09:08.540 --> 09:09.893
<i>I'm from the Chicago Examiner.</i>

09:10.100 --> 09:12.375
Are you the people
whose parents are lost at sea...

09:12.580 --> 09:15.140
...with the voice of lago, the parrot,
Gilbert Gottfried?

09:15.340 --> 09:16.932
- Yeah.
- Soup's on.

09:17.180 --> 09:18.659
- Let's go.
- Come on. Get in there.

09:18.860 --> 09:21.328
- Wait a minute.
- Don't miss that beat. Get around here.

09:21.540 --> 09:23.178
- Let's go.
- What's going on here?

09:23.420 --> 09:26.651
You. We're here to bring the country
live minute-by-minute coverage...

09:26.860 --> 09:29.374
...of your anguish
at the loss of Gilbert Gottfried.

09:29.620 --> 09:31.576
And your parents.

09:32.260 --> 09:33.488
They might still be alive.

09:33.700 --> 09:35.656
Yeah. And Hoffa's eating at Denny's.

09:38.060 --> 09:39.334
Now, wait a second now.

09:39.580 --> 09:42.572
You people can't just barge in here
and invade our privacy.

09:42.820 --> 09:44.139
Kelly, show these people out.

09:44.380 --> 09:47.690
We'll pay you a million dollars
for your exclusive story.

09:50.100 --> 09:52.295
Kelly, get these people a Snapple.

10:08.420 --> 10:11.776
It has been 24 hours. I'm starved.

10:11.980 --> 10:14.130
Me too.

10:14.540 --> 10:16.258
Hey, Al, why aren't you hungry?

10:16.500 --> 10:19.617
Because I've got
a natural appetite suppressant.

10:20.780 --> 10:23.294
Twenty-five years of marriage.

10:23.580 --> 10:28.176
Yeah, and since he doesn't brush,
he can always mine his teeth for food.

10:29.020 --> 10:31.773
Well, I'm starting to get hungry.

10:32.500 --> 10:34.536
Big surprise.

10:35.500 --> 10:36.899
Some captain you are.

10:37.100 --> 10:40.058
If you're not gonna go down
with the ship, at least do something.

10:40.260 --> 10:42.490
Oh, excuse me,
Miss We-Never-Do-Anything-Together.

10:42.740 --> 10:45.937
Well, we're dying together, Peg.
Are you happy now?

10:46.980 --> 10:51.849
Well, just don't look at me
to cheer anybody up anymore.

10:52.180 --> 10:54.933
You bent my props.

11:01.820 --> 11:06.894
As far as I'm concerned,
we can float out here sans comedy...

11:07.140 --> 11:12.294
...and die a miserable,
humorless death.

11:13.220 --> 11:17.691
Now look what you've done, Al.
You've upset the entertainer.

11:18.460 --> 11:20.337
Good. Maybe he'll walk.

11:21.540 --> 11:25.169
Hey, I know.
We could try to catch a fish.

11:25.460 --> 11:28.497
How? We got no rod,
we got no hooks, we got no bait.

11:35.260 --> 11:37.774
We got no rod and hooks.

11:38.060 --> 11:42.451
- Honey, we got this.
- Peg. Peg. Peg. That's a flare gun.

11:42.700 --> 11:45.976
We only use that
when the rescuers try to find us.

11:46.220 --> 11:49.849
Oh, but I don't want them
to see my hair.

11:52.580 --> 11:57.256
<i>Well, now I know why Jacques
Cousteau only has men on the Calypso.</i>

11:58.220 --> 12:00.415
That's not why.

12:07.620 --> 12:10.498
Hey, hey, we've got an oar.

12:10.780 --> 12:13.453
And there's dozens of little fish
swimming around the boat.

12:13.660 --> 12:17.619
We just hit them with the oar
and dinner is served.

12:19.060 --> 12:21.130
Without cooking it?

12:21.740 --> 12:26.860
Why bother? I mean,
cooking just makes them smaller.

12:32.220 --> 12:33.778
Al, just go hit a fish.

12:33.980 --> 12:38.292
Oh, all right. It's always,
"Al, I'm hungry. Al, I'm horny."

12:39.740 --> 12:42.538
Why can't it for once be,
"Al, wake up, it's Cindy Crawford...

12:42.740 --> 12:44.731
...I'm hungry and horny."

12:47.780 --> 12:51.409
- What are you waiting for?
- A red one.

12:53.300 --> 12:56.770
There it is. Gotcha!

12:57.740 --> 12:59.617
Hey, where'd she go?

13:00.460 --> 13:02.849
Where all dead fish go.

13:03.420 --> 13:05.695
To the Red Lobster?

13:06.460 --> 13:09.770
No, nimrod, to the bottom.

13:10.740 --> 13:15.336
Hey, Al, you know, I just remembered
the one thing I knew about the sea.

13:15.580 --> 13:20.700
If you beat a fish to a bloody pulp, it
tends to attract other fish, bigger fish.

13:20.940 --> 13:23.659
Fish with no known enemies.

13:37.860 --> 13:41.773
Well, this is nice.

13:42.380 --> 13:44.610
Does anyone know
how to repel a shark?

13:45.340 --> 13:47.570
Go ahead, Gilbert,
do your impressions.

13:48.900 --> 13:50.697
Okay, Jerry Lewis.

13:50.940 --> 13:54.774
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, drum roll.

13:54.980 --> 13:57.653
How much money did we raise?

14:04.260 --> 14:08.811
Hello, this is Miranda Veracruz
de la Jolla Cardenal.

14:11.420 --> 14:14.014
Live at the home
of Kelly and Bud Bundy...

14:14.260 --> 14:15.978
...who are anxiously awaiting news...

14:16.180 --> 14:18.819
...of whether their parents
will be found alive...

14:19.060 --> 14:22.496
...or if their decomposing corpses
will be found weeks later...

14:22.700 --> 14:25.612
...in some South Florida bog.

14:25.940 --> 14:29.250
Bud and Kelly, I know
that this is a difficult time for you...

14:29.500 --> 14:31.377
...but can you tell me
how you're feeling?

14:31.580 --> 14:34.492
And please be as graphic
as possible.

14:35.300 --> 14:37.370
We refuse to answer
this line of questioning...

14:37.580 --> 14:39.298
...until we find out if they're alive.

14:39.540 --> 14:41.929
Well, I apologize
if I seemed insensitive.

14:42.180 --> 14:44.899
So tell me, did your parents
ever abuse you?

14:46.860 --> 14:48.293
No.

14:48.620 --> 14:51.817
Surely your father
must have seen your heinie?

14:53.580 --> 14:55.332
Well, yeah, when I was a baby.

14:56.740 --> 14:59.618
Did Michael Jackson
ever touch you?

15:02.700 --> 15:05.260
Did Bob Barker ever touch you?

15:05.500 --> 15:07.138
- Tom Arnold?
- Roseanne?

15:07.340 --> 15:09.092
George Plimpton?

15:09.940 --> 15:12.215
What is the matter with you, people?

15:12.460 --> 15:15.054
Whatever happened to the noble image
of the fourth estate?

15:15.260 --> 15:17.649
People like Edward R. Murrow
and then Walter Cronkite?

15:17.860 --> 15:19.213
Who?

15:20.540 --> 15:21.768
Walt-- Walter Cronkite?

15:22.820 --> 15:24.458
Don't know that name.

15:24.700 --> 15:28.090
Was he ever touched
by Michael Jackson?

15:28.580 --> 15:31.333
Get away from me, you ghouls.

15:31.580 --> 15:34.048
What was I even thinking,
letting you people in here?

15:34.300 --> 15:38.179
Me and my sister will not sell
our parents out for money. Right, Kel?

15:38.420 --> 15:43.335
Well, then Daddy had Senator
Packwood chase me around the bed.

15:45.340 --> 15:48.332
Or was it Senator Mike Tyson?

15:49.420 --> 15:52.969
Yes, yes, it was both of them.

15:54.460 --> 15:56.849
Okay, Jerry Seinfeld.

15:57.620 --> 16:01.169
Why do people ride buses?

16:06.820 --> 16:09.653
Who are these people?

16:10.300 --> 16:14.691
And where do they find
exact change?

16:16.020 --> 16:18.409
- Hey, can you do Ted Kennedy?
- Sure.

16:18.660 --> 16:21.174
Anyone wanna hold my pants?

16:22.500 --> 16:23.569
Hold my pants.

16:23.780 --> 16:27.090
Look, Peg, it's obvious
we're not gonna be rescued...

16:27.340 --> 16:29.695
...and it's even more obvious why.

16:29.940 --> 16:33.979
Now look, one of us has gotta swim
for help. Any volunteers?

16:37.860 --> 16:40.658
Okay, okay. We should draw straws.

16:40.860 --> 16:43.897
- Did anybody bring straws?
- I have straws.

16:46.900 --> 16:48.492
Thank you.

16:52.140 --> 16:53.892
All right.

16:54.380 --> 16:55.859
Whoever picks the short one--

16:56.060 --> 16:58.733
Like we don't know
who that's gonna be.

16:59.100 --> 17:00.931
--swims for help.

17:11.140 --> 17:13.654
Gee, I can't believe how small it is.

17:14.020 --> 17:18.218
Boy, if I had a nickel
for every time I've said that.

17:21.980 --> 17:25.733
Oh, Al, I'm just kidding,
this is the bravest thing I've ever seen.

17:25.980 --> 17:27.857
You know, honey,
we've been through a lot.

17:28.060 --> 17:31.336
Good times and bad times. And,
you know, if I never see you again...

17:31.540 --> 17:34.293
...I just really want you to know
that I love--

17:37.340 --> 17:41.618
- Boy, he's a fast swimmer.
- Yeah, look at him go.

17:42.340 --> 17:45.810
Well, what do we do now?

17:46.060 --> 17:49.097
Well, there is the matter
of my cheque.

17:49.300 --> 17:51.416
You see,
just because the boat sinks...

17:51.620 --> 17:54.259
...doesn't mean a comic
has to work for free.

17:55.100 --> 17:57.773
Put a tray in it, Gilbert.

17:58.180 --> 18:01.570
Well, he's right, sweetheart.
Give the man a 20.

18:03.700 --> 18:05.770
Fine. Get me my wallet.

18:06.020 --> 18:09.979
- Okay. Where is it?
- On the ocean floor.

18:10.340 --> 18:14.777
Don't you realize that we are stuck
out here a million miles from nowhere.

18:15.020 --> 18:18.171
It's gonna be weeks
before we see any sign of life.

18:18.420 --> 18:20.012
<i>Ahoy there.</i>

18:20.260 --> 18:24.173
<i>We're a yacht full of congressmen
wasting out constituents' tax dollars.</i>

18:24.420 --> 18:27.890
<i>You need any help,
or liquor or anything?</i>

18:28.340 --> 18:30.058
We're saved!

18:31.020 --> 18:32.931
That's enough. Go away.

18:33.420 --> 18:35.980
It's been two days
since you were rescued, Mrs. Bundy...

18:36.180 --> 18:38.330
...and they still haven't found
your husband.

18:38.580 --> 18:42.653
How do you feel about that?
Cry if you can.

18:43.300 --> 18:46.610
Well, of course, we all want Al back.

18:46.860 --> 18:48.771
We thought he'd washed up
onto the beach...

18:48.980 --> 18:52.336
...but it turned out to be
just a giant jellyfish.

18:56.060 --> 18:58.494
Mrs. Bundy,
if you're husband does turn up dead...

18:58.700 --> 19:01.168
...we're willing to pay you
for your exclusive story.

19:01.420 --> 19:03.411
Really? Well, how much?

19:03.660 --> 19:05.730
Depends.
What did he do for a living?

19:05.980 --> 19:08.050
He was a shoe salesman.

19:08.300 --> 19:13.294
Fifty bucks.
Unless, of course, he abused you.

19:13.940 --> 19:16.693
- How much is that worth?
- $500,000.

19:17.540 --> 19:20.850
Well, you know he did make us drive
around in that Dodge.

19:21.100 --> 19:23.409
And he made us live in this house.
Is that enough?

19:23.660 --> 19:26.094
- Oh, God--
- God, yes. Awesome.

19:26.340 --> 19:28.649
How did you put up with it
all this time?

19:28.900 --> 19:30.891
Daddy!

19:31.140 --> 19:33.096
Daddy!

19:34.140 --> 19:35.812
Thank you.

19:39.060 --> 19:42.973
Oh, Al... vin.

19:43.220 --> 19:47.816
Alvin Bundy.
My late husband's identical twin.

19:48.060 --> 19:51.894
How nice of you to drop by
on such a sad occasion.

19:52.380 --> 19:54.291
How much, Peg?

19:55.100 --> 19:58.137
Enough to make it worth your while
to walk out and never come back.

19:58.380 --> 20:00.132
Five dollars?

20:01.180 --> 20:04.934
- Nice try, Mrs. Bundy.
- And Mr. Bundy.

20:05.220 --> 20:07.017
Who's for rooting through
Oprah's trash?

20:10.340 --> 20:14.128
Well, perhaps some of our viewers
who sit way too close to the screen...

20:14.340 --> 20:16.695
...might find your rescue story
interesting.

20:16.940 --> 20:18.658
Well, it-- It is, really.

20:18.900 --> 20:23.337
I swam for hours and then when
I didn't think I could go on any longer...

20:23.580 --> 20:27.129
...suddenly I was surrounded
by a school of man-eating sharks...

20:27.380 --> 20:30.816
...when miraculously
some dolphins chased them away...

20:31.060 --> 20:32.857
...swam me to safety.

20:33.100 --> 20:38.094
Man and dolphin, working together
against a common enemy.

20:38.940 --> 20:41.738
And did any of them abuse you?

20:45.660 --> 20:47.730
No, they saved my life.

20:47.980 --> 20:49.936
Turn the camera off.

20:50.940 --> 20:53.249
- Hey, where you going?
- It's sweeps, guys.

20:53.500 --> 20:56.298
Unless that dolphin
was Michael Jackson's love child...

20:56.500 --> 20:57.694
...we've got nothing.

21:00.620 --> 21:02.929
Peg, by the way,
thanks for the all-out effort...

21:03.140 --> 21:05.051
...to find me after you were rescued.

21:05.300 --> 21:09.612
You know, I wanted to wait to find you,
but I was outvoted five to nothing.

21:09.860 --> 21:12.010
I mean, four to one.

21:12.900 --> 21:15.209
Mom, you shouldn't talk like that
to Dad's twin.

21:15.420 --> 21:17.456
You know he's gonna tell.

21:22.020 --> 21:25.217
Peg, I'm only gonna say this once
because I'm tired and I--

21:25.460 --> 21:28.179
I think I have a clam in my shorts.

21:28.500 --> 21:30.730
Don't flatter yourself.

21:30.980 --> 21:33.175
No more magazine contests.

21:33.420 --> 21:36.378
As I've said before,
no good can come of it.

21:42.460 --> 21:47.454
Congratulations. I'm Gilbert Gottfried
and you've just won one--
