right where we

Uh, didn't even get back
before I got the call.

You enjoy yourself,
touring with

Walter "Wolfman"
Washington's band,

01:44.046 --> 01:45.312
tickling the ivories?

01:45.314 --> 01:46.913
Had a lot of fun.

01:46.915 --> 01:48.882
Didn't last long enough though.
How about you?

01:48.884 --> 01:50.684
Did you get
a chance to unpack?

01:50.686 --> 01:52.686
Barely. But it was
good to get home

01:52.688 --> 01:55.422
for a couple of weeks, catch
up with some old friends.

01:56.725 --> 01:59.092
Oh, gentlemen never
kiss and tell.

01:59.094 --> 02:01.127
You know that.

02:01.129 --> 02:02.662
How many wounded?

02:02.664 --> 02:04.431
Three.
One critical.

02:04.433 --> 02:05.665
Gilbert Lee.

02:05.667 --> 02:08.101
Owns that new bistro in Marigny.

02:08.103 --> 02:09.568

He's engaged
to my friend Bella Pearl.

02:10.973 --> 02:13.640
Take it the lone
fatality's ours?

02:13.642 --> 02:15.141
Looks that way.

02:15.143 --> 02:16.776
PRIDE:
Loretta?

02:16.778 --> 02:20.013
Master Chief Dylan Maron, 40,
just in on shore leave.

02:20.015 --> 02:22.849
At least we survived
<i>our</i> vacations.

02:22.851 --> 02:25.685
Loretta, I never
doubted you for a second.

02:25.687 --> 02:27.387
Sure you did.

02:27.389 --> 02:30.824
Said you couldn't picture me
backpacking, remember?

02:30.826 --> 02:32.359
Of course,
you were right.

02:32.361 --> 02:34.361
Talked Annie
into renting a hotel

02:34.363 --> 02:35.562
halfway through.

02:35.564 --> 02:37.964
Ate Oreo cookies,
watched movies.

02:37.966 --> 02:39.232
Had a grand old time.

02:39.234 --> 02:40.467
That's what it's all about.

02:41.503 --> 02:43.403
Theories?

02:43.405 --> 02:45.472
Well, it's
too soon to tell.

02:45.474 --> 02:47.173
There's a lot
of other victims.

02:47.175 --> 02:48.842
Although they were
only wounded.

02:48.844 --> 02:52.012
WADE: Still, based on the
specific location of the shot,

02:52.014 --> 02:54.147
just right
of the scapula

02:54.149 --> 02:56.483
and just below
the T-4 vertebrae,

02:56.485 --> 02:58.451
our master chief was unlucky,

02:58.453 --> 03:01.555
or our sniper knew exactly
what he was aiming for.

03:01.557 --> 03:05.025
Well, if he was targeted,
then why shoot the others?

03:05.027 --> 03:06.259
Don't know.

03:06.261 --> 03:07.594
And we don't know why

03:07.596 --> 03:09.162
he killed an investment banker
last week

03:09.164 --> 03:10.530
outside the
ferry terminal.

03:10.532 --> 03:12.098
What do you mean?

03:12.100 --> 03:15.268
.308. High-powered
and long-distance.

03:15.270 --> 03:17.671
Connecting both cases,
according to NOPD.

03:17.673 --> 03:19.906
Which means we're
probably looking for

03:19.908 --> 03:21.875
the same sniper
or snipers.

03:21.877 --> 03:24.844
Question is: what's he after?

03:24.846 --> 03:27.247
Or are we just dealing
with some random crazy?

03:27.249 --> 03:30.483
Wouldn't be the first time
a sniper terrorized NOLA.

03:30.485 --> 03:32.786
40 years ago.
I remember it all too well.

03:32.788 --> 03:35.021
I never seen my mama
that scared before.

03:35.023 --> 03:37.757
Put the whole city on edge
for over a week.

03:37.759 --> 03:40.026
Yeah, then we need to
stop this joker fast.

03:40.028 --> 03:44.431
Find anything and everything
you can on these victims.

03:44.433 --> 03:46.733
Especially connections
to that banker.

03:46.735 --> 03:48.401
Want me to call
Percy and Brody?

03:48.403 --> 03:50.103
Already did.
Left word for Brody.

03:50.105 --> 03:51.271
Sonja's on her way back.

03:51.273 --> 03:52.772
She'll meet you
at the squad room.

03:52.774 --> 03:54.541
Copy that.

03:56.178 --> 03:59.112
First a cartel tries
to blow up the bridge,

03:59.114 --> 04:01.214
and D.C. puts us
under review.

04:01.216 --> 04:04.851
Now snipers
taking potshots at folks.

04:04.853 --> 04:07.654
What's happening to our city,
Loretta?

04:08.724 --> 04:10.657
Something you're gonna stop.

04:12.628 --> 04:14.794
(phone ringing)

04:15.998 --> 04:17.764
Sebastian.

04:17.766 --> 04:20.600
SEBASTIAN:
Hey, I'm over here.

04:20.601 --> 04:21.834
Up on the roof.

04:21.837 --> 04:24.404
Yeah, uh,
I think I found something.

04:24.406 --> 04:28.141
Actually, I found nothing--
but that could mean something.

04:28.944 --> 04:31.144
Welcome back.

04:33.382 --> 04:37.283
All right, so I triangulated
from where the... Whoa-ho.

04:37.285 --> 04:38.386
Hey. You all right?

04:38.409 --> 04:39.586
Yeah, yeah.
I'm fine, I'm fine.

04:39.588 --> 04:40.264
You sure?

04:40.288 --> 04:41.621
Yeah. I just... long
as I don't look down.

04:41.623 --> 04:43.823
I'm not really, uh,
crazy about heights.

04:43.825 --> 04:45.558
It's not that
I'm acrophobic,

04:45.560 --> 04:48.995
per Se, it's just more of
a generalized anxiety.

04:48.997 --> 04:50.363
It's probably agoraphobic,
actually,

04:50.365 --> 04:52.532
now that I think about it,
but I never got that diagnosed.

04:52.534 --> 04:53.933
Which means I should call
somebody and try to get...

04:53.935 --> 04:54.968
- Sebastian.
- Sorry.

04:54.970 --> 04:57.270
Uh, okay. So, I, uh,

04:57.272 --> 04:59.637
I triangulated from where
the victims were shot,

04:59.638 --> 05:01.299
I compared it to
the crack of the rounds

05:01.300 --> 05:03.333
heard by some of the witnesses,
and then factored in

05:03.334 --> 05:05.835
sound delay to estimate range,
and voila.

05:05.837 --> 05:07.670
You're standing in
the sniper's nest.

05:07.672 --> 05:10.139
Stage is almost
a half-mile away.

05:10.141 --> 05:10.846
You're sure?

05:10.870 --> 05:12.530
Yeah, I'm pretty
positive.

05:12.877 --> 05:15.011
Except for the fact that I
didn't find any trace evidence,

05:15.013 --> 05:17.547
which, you know,
is kind of weird.

05:17.549 --> 05:19.449
Well, how can somebody
pull all this off

05:19.451 --> 05:21.150
without leaving
any evidence?

05:21.152 --> 05:22.351
Well, that's, uh,
that's what's weird.

05:22.353 --> 05:23.953
I mean, there's no
spent casings,

05:23.955 --> 05:26.255
gunshot residue,
hair follicles, shoeprints.

05:26.257 --> 05:27.557
I mean, there's...

05:27.559 --> 05:29.158
there's nothing.

05:29.160 --> 05:31.127
That's why I-I think
it's something.

05:31.129 --> 05:32.058
Sniper's a professional.

05:32.082 --> 05:33.130
Exactly.

05:33.131 --> 05:35.531
Whoever he or she or they were,

05:35.533 --> 05:37.266
they knew exactly
where to shoot from,

05:37.268 --> 05:39.035
how to escape
without being detected

05:39.037 --> 05:41.237
and how to cover their tracks.
I mean, it reads targeted.

05:41.239 --> 05:44.373
Gonna need your assist on this,
Sebastian,

05:44.375 --> 05:46.409
till the whole team gets back.

05:46.411 --> 05:47.777
Get Patton

05:47.779 --> 05:49.378
to pull surveillance footage,

05:49.380 --> 05:51.981
then help him scan for suspects
in the immediate area.

05:51.983 --> 05:53.144
And see what you can find
on those bullets.

05:53.168 --> 05:54.118
All right, will do.

05:54.119 --> 05:55.818
Okay.
Oh, and by the way,

05:55.820 --> 05:57.787
you haven't, uh...
you haven't heard from Merri--

05:57.789 --> 06:00.623
I mean, uh, Brody, have you?
Just 'cause, you know, I...

06:00.625 --> 06:02.291
put a few calls in
to her myself,

06:02.293 --> 06:04.627
but she probably forgot to get on the
Caribbean calling plan, or something.

06:04.629 --> 06:07.563
Yeah, well, I haven't
made contact with her yet.

06:07.565 --> 06:09.665
But I left word.

06:09.667 --> 06:11.901
Know she took
the Russo betrayal hard.

06:11.903 --> 06:13.836
Feels bad about
the D.C. blowback on us.

06:13.838 --> 06:15.404
Maybe she just
needs more time.

06:15.406 --> 06:16.639
Right now,

06:16.641 --> 06:18.074
case is all that matters.

06:18.076 --> 06:19.775
Get on that surveillance
footage, will ya?

06:19.777 --> 06:21.144
I'm on it.

06:23.047 --> 06:25.982
Hold the door?
Hold the... Okay.

06:30.088 --> 06:31.921
(siren whooping in distance)

06:33.057 --> 06:35.491
(monitor beeping steadily,
air pumping)

06:42.934 --> 06:44.333
Bella.

06:45.870 --> 06:48.271
(sobs):
It's bad.

06:48.273 --> 06:49.839
(quietly):
I know.

06:49.841 --> 06:51.440
I know.

06:51.442 --> 06:55.077
They're getting him
ready for surgery.

06:55.079 --> 06:56.679
They said it's
life-threatening.

06:56.681 --> 06:58.948
(sniffles)

06:58.950 --> 07:01.017
What if I lose him?

07:01.019 --> 07:03.052
Don't talk like that.

07:03.054 --> 07:05.454
Doesn't do any good.

07:05.456 --> 07:08.257
You can do this.
I know it, Bella.

07:08.259 --> 07:10.760
I've seen myself
what you've overcome.

07:10.762 --> 07:14.564
I just don't understand
who would do such a thing.

07:14.566 --> 07:17.767
The whole town's
scared half to death.

07:17.769 --> 07:19.669
That's why I'm here.

07:19.671 --> 07:22.271
I'm hoping you
can help me.

07:22.273 --> 07:24.740
Can you tell me
what you saw?

07:24.742 --> 07:26.509
It all happened so fast.

07:26.511 --> 07:28.978
I was only on stage
for a few seconds,

07:28.980 --> 07:30.880
and all hell broke loose.

07:30.882 --> 07:32.915
Do you know who
got shot first?

07:34.018 --> 07:36.452
Eyewitnesses are critical
in situations like this,

07:36.454 --> 07:38.454
and you were
front and center.

07:38.456 --> 07:42.158
I think one or two men
on the steps,

07:42.160 --> 07:44.427
then a woman...

07:44.429 --> 07:45.695
and Gilbert.

07:45.697 --> 07:47.396
What about the sailor?

07:47.398 --> 07:49.065
Was he by the stage, too?

07:49.067 --> 07:52.902
First I saw, he was running
towards Gilbert.

07:52.904 --> 07:55.037
To help him, I think.

07:55.039 --> 07:56.272
Then...

07:56.274 --> 07:58.441
(shuddering breath)

07:59.811 --> 08:01.844
It's okay. Come on.
You're doing fine.

08:01.846 --> 08:03.546
(sniffling)
So...

08:03.548 --> 08:08.517
did it look like
that Gilbert was just...

08:08.519 --> 08:11.020
in the wrong place
at the wrong time?

08:11.022 --> 08:12.788
Random?

08:14.158 --> 08:15.725
Wait.

08:15.727 --> 08:17.627
You're saying the shooter
was aiming for him?

08:17.629 --> 08:19.595
It's not just
some crackpot?

08:19.597 --> 08:22.431
Nah, I'm just trying (cell phone ringing)
to sort it all out.

08:22.433 --> 08:23.799
It's still early.

08:25.637 --> 08:27.870
Oh.

08:27.872 --> 08:29.739
Can you excuse me?

08:29.741 --> 08:33.208
I-I have to take this call.
I'll be right back. Okay?

08:33.211 --> 08:35.244
Sorry.

08:35.246 --> 08:37.212
Trying to get ahold
of you, Brody.

08:37.215 --> 08:39.515
Where the hell you been?
You okay?

08:39.517 --> 08:41.384
(jazz playing over radio)

08:41.385 --> 08:43.019
Oh, hey, Roy.
How's the arm?

08:43.020 --> 08:45.488
Got my wound pin--
nice scar, too.

08:45.490 --> 08:47.056
My hero. (chuckles)

08:47.058 --> 08:48.491
LASALLE:
There she is.

08:48.493 --> 08:49.625
I was starting to wonder

08:49.627 --> 08:51.193
if you were gonna
come back at all.

08:51.195 --> 08:52.595
Oh, yeah,
I thought about it.

08:52.597 --> 08:55.097
Then I realized
y'all would be lost without me.

08:55.099 --> 08:56.432
Appreciate the sacrifice.

08:56.434 --> 08:57.900
(chuckles)

08:59.737 --> 09:01.704
Hell, this place
looks good as new.

09:01.706 --> 09:05.107
Seems Lieutenant Buckley can do
more than just tend bar.

09:05.109 --> 09:06.709
He's a jack
of all trades.

09:06.711 --> 09:08.277
How was the
Civil War tour?

09:08.279 --> 09:09.478
Interesting.

09:09.480 --> 09:11.447
Uh, spoiler alert:
the South lost.

09:11.449 --> 09:13.816
Yeah, I heard.
So what is going on?

09:13.818 --> 09:15.618
It took me no time
to get here from the airport.

09:15.620 --> 09:16.852
I've never seen the city
like this.

09:16.854 --> 09:18.554
Yeah, folks are spooked.

09:18.556 --> 09:20.890
Not sure when the sniper's
gonna strike next.

09:20.892 --> 09:23.292
Two separate attacks.

09:23.294 --> 09:24.875
Two are dead, four wounded
and one critical.

09:24.876 --> 09:25.995
Any connection between the vics?

09:26.019 --> 09:27.264
Not so far.

09:27.265 --> 09:28.798
Couldn't be a more
unrelated bunch.

09:28.800 --> 09:31.067
So what are we looking at?

09:31.069 --> 09:33.404
Our own Beltway sniper?
A random crazy?

09:33.405 --> 09:34.904
Well, I don't think so.

09:34.906 --> 09:37.873
He's a expert marksmen,
covers his tracks like a pro.

09:37.875 --> 09:41.277
Plus, Miss Loretta called
and said the two murder vics

09:41.279 --> 09:44.480
were shot straight
through the heart.

09:44.482 --> 09:45.948
From a half mile away, too.

09:45.950 --> 09:47.383
Whoa.

09:48.453 --> 09:50.252
Hey, um...

09:50.254 --> 09:51.787
did Pride hear
anything from D.C.

09:51.789 --> 09:53.289
about whether or not
we're being reviewed?

09:53.291 --> 09:55.024
No news is good news.

09:55.026 --> 09:56.625
Not necessarily.

09:56.627 --> 09:59.428
Not after you've been
infiltrated by a DHS mole.

09:59.430 --> 10:02.698
Speaking of Russo,
where is Brody?

10:02.700 --> 10:03.799
Don't know.

10:03.801 --> 10:05.401
Pride says she's
coming back soon.

10:05.403 --> 10:06.736
I wouldn't count on it.

10:06.738 --> 10:09.472
Just spoke to Merri.

10:10.475 --> 10:12.675
She's not coming back.

10:31.100 --> 10:32.900
I don't understand.

10:32.902 --> 10:34.935
What do you mean,
Brody's not coming back?

10:34.937 --> 10:36.770
Yeah, did she say
for how long?

10:36.772 --> 10:38.272
She all right?

10:38.274 --> 10:41.008
Said she's sad about leaving us,
but not the job.

10:41.010 --> 10:43.143
Seemed pretty clear
about her decision.

10:43.145 --> 10:44.778
But, no, that
doesn't make sense.

10:44.780 --> 10:48.148
Believe me, I tried
to talk her out of it.

10:48.150 --> 10:50.184
Told her that if this
had anything to do

10:50.186 --> 10:51.785
with being taken
advantage of by Russo...

10:51.787 --> 10:52.920
That's not her fault!

10:52.922 --> 10:54.621
None of us knew
Russo was a terrorist.

10:54.623 --> 10:55.823
I told her that, too.

10:55.825 --> 10:58.192
And I also said
not coming back

10:58.194 --> 11:00.894
could make her and us
look complicit to D.C.

11:00.896 --> 11:02.830
There's got to be
more to it than that.

11:02.832 --> 11:05.632
I mean, Russo can't just be
the only reason she quit.

11:05.634 --> 11:06.934
Claims it's not.

11:06.936 --> 11:08.802
According to her, she's
been thinking about this

11:08.804 --> 11:09.970
for a long time now.

11:09.972 --> 11:12.072
PATTON:
Well, lookee who's back

11:12.074 --> 11:13.440
from Chickamauga.

11:14.543 --> 11:16.343
I'm a big Civil War buff myself.

11:16.345 --> 11:17.644
Well, actually, I'm convinced

11:17.646 --> 11:19.513
I fought at
the Battle of Fort Wagner

11:19.515 --> 11:21.682
in my prior life.

11:25.287 --> 11:27.154
Okay, I admit it was a stretch.

11:27.156 --> 11:30.224
PRIDE: Just filled
everybody in, Patton.

11:30.226 --> 11:31.725
Brody quit.

11:31.727 --> 11:33.060
Wait, what?

11:33.062 --> 11:34.661
Did you tell her
about the sniper?

11:34.663 --> 11:37.031
Did you tell her how much
we need her right now?

11:37.033 --> 11:38.966
PRIDE: No, we've always
got something going on.

11:38.968 --> 11:42.269
I didn't see any reason to make
her feel bad about her decision.

11:42.271 --> 11:44.738
Oh, but it's okay for her
to leave us high and dry?

11:44.740 --> 11:45.454
Percy.

11:45.478 --> 11:46.341
No, what-what...

11:46.342 --> 11:48.442
what happened
to "we're a team"?

11:48.444 --> 11:50.844
This is our family.

11:50.846 --> 11:52.279
She can't just abandon us!

11:52.281 --> 11:54.114
Does Sebastian know?

11:55.584 --> 11:58.052
Oh, he's gonna be crushed.

11:58.054 --> 11:59.586
(sighs)

11:59.588 --> 12:03.424
We've all been
caught off guard.

12:03.426 --> 12:06.093
But right now, we
got a job to do.

12:06.095 --> 12:08.862
We owe it to the city
to put our focus on that.

12:08.864 --> 12:10.531
Gonna have to
double up on duties,

12:10.533 --> 12:11.999
till I can get some help.

12:12.001 --> 12:14.168
In the meantime,

12:14.170 --> 12:15.636
what do we know?

12:15.638 --> 12:18.739
Well, not much, unfortunately,

12:18.741 --> 12:21.275
other than everyone was shot
from long range.

12:21.277 --> 12:24.545
But no other clear links,
and no clear motive

12:24.547 --> 12:27.714
to want to kill either the
banker or our master chief.

12:27.716 --> 12:30.284
Ditto on the cell phone cams
and the surveillance footage.

12:30.286 --> 12:32.319
Other than the fact
that the sniper disabled

12:32.321 --> 12:33.754
selective cameras all
around the Moonwalk.

12:33.756 --> 12:34.922
Yeah, which means

12:34.924 --> 12:38.125
he, or they, knew exactly
how not to be seen.

12:38.127 --> 12:39.827
PATTON: I've been through
all the footage I got,

12:39.829 --> 12:40.861
but nothing.

12:40.863 --> 12:42.296
The man is a ghost.

12:42.298 --> 12:43.764
Well, I don't
believe in ghosts.

12:43.766 --> 12:45.566
Had to disable those
cameras at some point.

12:45.568 --> 12:46.967
(phone beeping)

12:46.969 --> 12:48.535
Go back days.

12:48.537 --> 12:51.271
Weeks if you have to.

12:52.842 --> 12:54.141
Problem?

12:54.143 --> 12:56.877
When the mayor calls? Usually.

12:56.879 --> 13:00.347
See what NOPD has on the
first attack and the banker.

13:00.349 --> 13:02.015
If this isn't random,

13:02.017 --> 13:04.284
there's got to
be a connection.

13:10.092 --> 13:12.459
HAMILTON: <i>Whole damn city's</i>
<i>in a panic, Dwayne.</i>

13:12.461 --> 13:14.394
Phone's ringing off the hook.
Governor, senator, media--

13:14.396 --> 13:16.263
they all want to know
what the hell we're doing.

13:16.265 --> 13:17.431
You're on this, right?

13:17.433 --> 13:20.300
A master chief
was one of the victims.

13:20.302 --> 13:23.137
All right, I want
you taking lead.

13:23.139 --> 13:25.038
I want you overseeing
everything, do you understand?

13:25.040 --> 13:27.374
Sorry, what about NOPD, FBI?

13:27.376 --> 13:29.276
The NOPD is good,
but they're not you.

13:29.278 --> 13:30.811
FBI-- they think they're God.

13:30.813 --> 13:32.246
They don't share
jack with us.

13:32.248 --> 13:34.448
Plus, I don't much like them
snooping around me anyway.

13:34.450 --> 13:37.651
You mean, the city or you?

13:41.190 --> 13:43.257
I think you know
what I mean.

13:44.593 --> 13:46.293
Just fix this.

13:46.295 --> 13:47.694
For everybody's sake.

13:47.696 --> 13:50.631
We might be dealing
with a pro here.

13:50.633 --> 13:51.999
Victims could be
targeted.

13:52.001 --> 13:53.300
Well, it'll make it
easier for you

13:53.302 --> 13:54.601
to figure out who's doing this.

13:54.603 --> 13:56.603
Be easier if you'd authorize
a bigger police presence,

13:56.605 --> 13:59.773
ask LSP to put up helos,
checkpoints.

13:59.775 --> 14:01.708
Well, I'll do what I can.

14:01.710 --> 14:04.111
Meanwhile, we can't have folks
thinking that we're afraid, too.

14:04.113 --> 14:05.345
We need to protect our people.

14:05.347 --> 14:08.382
No, we need to
protect our image.

14:08.384 --> 14:10.384
Next to Mardi Gras
and Halloween,

14:10.386 --> 14:12.452
Fall Fest is the biggest
week of the year for us.

14:12.454 --> 14:14.755
I mean, we can't have folks
hiding inside their houses.

14:14.757 --> 14:16.690
Got to get out.
We need them outside.

14:17.826 --> 14:19.660
I'm counting on you, Dwayne.

14:22.097 --> 14:24.698
WADE: <i>He can't put this</i>
<i>all on you; it's not fair.</i>

14:24.700 --> 14:26.166
<i>Hamilton should be doing</i>

14:26.168 --> 14:28.101
everything possible
to keep those bodies

14:28.103 --> 14:30.103
from ending up
on my tables.

14:30.105 --> 14:33.006
Well, I think we both know that
smart and fair aren't usually

14:33.008 --> 14:35.442
as important to the mayor
as covering his backside.

14:35.444 --> 14:37.277
(chuckles)
Maybe you should be mayor.

14:37.279 --> 14:38.612
Ha!

14:38.614 --> 14:39.913
Think I got enough
on my plate.

14:39.915 --> 14:41.782
Thank you very
much, Loretta.

14:41.784 --> 14:45.586
Bet your music tour feels like
weeks ago, not just yesterday.

14:45.588 --> 14:47.788
So much for finding
balance in your life.

14:47.790 --> 14:49.723
Ongoing challenge,
to be sure.

14:49.725 --> 14:51.225
Not something
I'm giving up on.

14:51.227 --> 14:53.126
Just not a priority
at the moment.

14:53.128 --> 14:55.796
Is it ever?

14:57.633 --> 15:00.467
I was able to get the victim
from the first sniper attack

15:00.469 --> 15:02.636
transferred from
Orleans M.E.

15:02.638 --> 15:04.705
The investment banker?

15:04.707 --> 15:08.875
And that's when I realized
both he and the master chief

15:08.877 --> 15:10.944
were shot through the heart.

15:10.946 --> 15:12.464
Perfectly placed, too.

15:12.488 --> 15:13.281
Kill shots.

15:13.282 --> 15:15.582
One lucky shot I could buy,
but two?

15:15.584 --> 15:17.484
Can't be a coincidence.

15:17.486 --> 15:19.519
Yeah, it means your shooter
or shooters are cocky, too.

15:19.521 --> 15:20.721
I mean,
they didn't even bother

15:20.723 --> 15:22.422
to use the classic
Mozambique Drill.

15:22.424 --> 15:23.824
A variation of which
was used on JFK.

15:23.826 --> 15:25.325
Do not get me started on that.

15:25.327 --> 15:26.593
On the same page there.

15:26.595 --> 15:29.263
Point is,
to try to shoot somebody

15:29.265 --> 15:32.399
from half a mile away with
a single shot to the heart--

15:32.401 --> 15:33.433
that's more than good.

15:33.435 --> 15:35.502
That's, like,
<i>American Sniper</i> good.

15:35.504 --> 15:36.670
Now, whoever you're
looking for,

15:36.672 --> 15:38.338
they obviously like a challenge.

15:38.340 --> 15:40.707
Still, if he's so good,
why miss the other victims?

15:40.709 --> 15:41.875
Just injured them.

15:41.877 --> 15:44.444
Maybe he doesn't miss.

15:44.446 --> 15:46.246
Maybe the sniper

15:46.248 --> 15:47.648
or snipers

15:47.650 --> 15:49.249
just want to make
the attacks look random

15:49.251 --> 15:51.852
to cover their
real targets.

15:51.854 --> 15:55.522
Keep us from figuring out
who's behind this and why.

15:55.524 --> 15:57.891
Well, on the who of it all,
I might have a lead.

15:57.893 --> 16:00.594
So, Lasalle sent me the NOPD
files on the first attack.

16:00.596 --> 16:02.996
And after I
compared them

16:02.998 --> 16:06.133
to the Burlesque Fest M.O.,
I was able to triangulate

16:06.135 --> 16:08.702
the sniper's nest
to Crescent City Connection.

16:08.704 --> 16:10.604
Just like the Moonwalk,
it's about a half a mile away.

16:10.606 --> 16:12.139
PRIDE:
If so,

16:12.141 --> 16:13.974
got to be something on
bridge surveillance cameras.

16:13.976 --> 16:15.542
Can't disable
them all.

16:15.544 --> 16:17.711
That's good work,
Sebastian.

16:17.713 --> 16:19.980
Can you get
this to Patton?

16:19.982 --> 16:21.682
See what he
can find ASAP?

16:21.684 --> 16:23.317
ASAP it is.

16:25.120 --> 16:27.220
(door opens)

16:27.222 --> 16:28.722
(sighs)

16:28.724 --> 16:30.123
(door closes)

16:30.125 --> 16:32.592
Take it from a coroner,

16:32.594 --> 16:35.395
carrying the weight of the
world's not good for longevity.

16:35.397 --> 16:37.464
I know.

16:37.466 --> 16:41.034
But it's more than just
all this, Loretta.

16:41.036 --> 16:43.070
Merri.

16:43.972 --> 16:46.106
You know?

16:46.108 --> 16:47.507
I'm her landlord.

16:47.509 --> 16:48.975
Or was.

16:48.977 --> 16:50.644
She was afraid to talk to you.

16:50.646 --> 16:53.547
Afraid you'd be
disappointed in her.

16:53.549 --> 16:55.315
I'm not disappointed in <i>her.</i>

16:55.317 --> 16:57.084
I'm disappointed in myself.

16:57.086 --> 16:58.885
I should've paid more attention.

16:58.887 --> 17:00.087
I should've seen
this coming.

17:00.089 --> 17:02.155
So what, now you want
to take on her problems, too?

17:02.157 --> 17:03.423
No, it's not that.
It's just that

17:03.425 --> 17:04.590
maybe I could've
done something.

17:04.593 --> 17:05.858
Maybe I could've
talked her out of it.

17:05.861 --> 17:07.194
If I'd, if I'd...
Dwayne.

17:07.195 --> 17:10.664
What she did and why she did it
had nothing to do with you.

17:10.665 --> 17:12.031
Or any of us.

17:12.034 --> 17:14.367
It had everything
to do with her.

17:14.369 --> 17:17.170
Brody was my first stab
at expanding the team.

17:17.172 --> 17:19.806
Beyond Christopher
and myself.

17:19.808 --> 17:22.608
Can't help but feel
some responsibility.

17:22.611 --> 17:24.444
Like Sonja says,
we're a family.

17:24.445 --> 17:26.213
Brody left because
she needed to.

17:26.214 --> 17:29.116
It's that simple.

17:29.118 --> 17:30.984
Wait, Merri left?

17:31.920 --> 17:33.687
Just-just like that?

17:33.689 --> 17:35.856
She-she's not coming back?

17:42.898 --> 17:43.800
What do you got, Patton?

17:43.824 --> 17:45.165
Nothing on the bridge.

17:45.167 --> 17:46.900
They disabled
the cameras there, too.

17:46.902 --> 17:48.602
But I think I spotted
the suspect's van

17:48.604 --> 17:50.103
on Tchoupitoulas exit,

17:50.105 --> 17:51.738
three minutes
after the first attack.

17:51.740 --> 17:53.774
Okay, good. You got enough
to track where he is now?

17:53.776 --> 17:55.108
No, not yet.

17:55.110 --> 17:56.543
Well, what'd you
call us in here for?

17:56.545 --> 17:59.212
Because in looking for it,
(beeping) I noticed three...

17:59.214 --> 18:00.847
now four surveillance cameras
going down

18:00.849 --> 18:02.048
in and around Champions Square.

18:02.050 --> 18:02.946
When?

18:02.970 --> 18:04.970
Right now!

18:06.221 --> 18:09.523
King, I think we got
a bead on our sniper.

18:09.525 --> 18:11.725
(lively jazz music playing)

18:21.570 --> 18:23.003
Where are you, Christopher?

18:23.005 --> 18:24.538
Office building on Poydras.

18:24.540 --> 18:25.906
The last surveillance camera

18:25.908 --> 18:27.374
that went off
was on the rooftop.

Whoa, whoa, don't shoot.

19:30.739 --> 19:32.839
I'm putting the gun down.

19:34.409 --> 19:35.809
Turn around slowly.

19:41.683 --> 19:43.717
FBI?

19:43.719 --> 19:45.719
Friendly little town
you got here.

19:45.721 --> 19:47.354
And now one that still has

19:47.356 --> 19:50.323
a sniper on the loose,
thanks to you.

20:12.071 --> 20:14.204
(sirens wailing,
emergency horn blares)

20:15.274 --> 20:16.440
LASALLE:
You still haven't told us

20:16.442 --> 20:17.942
how you knew
the sniper would be there.

20:17.944 --> 20:20.010
SAC says it's on
a need-to-know basis.

20:20.012 --> 20:22.212
We're federal agents
and we need to know.

20:22.214 --> 20:23.547
Not my call.

20:23.549 --> 20:25.215
You couldn't have
used ShotSpotter.

20:25.217 --> 20:27.184
That doesn't work until
after shots are fired.

20:27.186 --> 20:28.852
FBI uses other tools.

20:28.854 --> 20:30.854
Like Geo-profiling software?

20:30.856 --> 20:32.957
That's right,
you used to be ATF.

20:32.959 --> 20:35.125
Hey, hold up.

20:35.127 --> 20:37.261
How did you know that?
We just met.

20:37.263 --> 20:38.929
I do my homework.

20:38.931 --> 20:41.665
I like to know who the good guys
are when I come into town,

20:41.667 --> 20:44.802
so I don't get into any more
friendly fire incidents.

20:47.139 --> 20:49.139
Kidding. Relax.

20:49.141 --> 20:51.809
Yeah, well, you're lucky
we didn't shoot you.

20:51.811 --> 20:53.410
And it wouldn't have
been a problem

20:53.412 --> 20:55.813
if the FBI would've deigned
to share Intel with us.

20:55.815 --> 20:57.114
So, you're not NOLA?

20:57.116 --> 20:59.783
Spent some time down here
a few years go, then bolted.

20:59.785 --> 21:02.620
I'm not much of a foodie
or big on humidity.

21:02.622 --> 21:04.421
Still, since they
know I have history,

21:04.423 --> 21:06.290
D.C. sent me down
here to assist.

21:06.292 --> 21:07.958
Whoa, did you say D.C.?

21:07.960 --> 21:09.226
That's right.

21:09.228 --> 21:11.462
They want this
solved yesterday,

21:11.464 --> 21:13.297
and because of that,
we don't have time

21:13.299 --> 21:14.965
to catch everybody up.
No offense.

21:14.967 --> 21:16.033
Too late.

21:17.770 --> 21:19.036
You Agent Pride?

21:19.038 --> 21:21.238
Special Agent
Tammy Gregorio.

21:21.240 --> 21:23.407
NOLA FBI says a lot of
good things about you.

21:23.409 --> 21:24.742
It's really nice
to meet you.

21:24.744 --> 21:27.077
Be nicer if we had a little
interagency cooperation.

21:27.079 --> 21:28.921
I don't like
how this went down.

21:28.945 --> 21:29.580
As I explained to your...

21:29.582 --> 21:30.681
May I finish?

21:30.683 --> 21:32.750
I already talked
to NOLA FBI.

21:32.752 --> 21:35.452
I don't have time or patience
for jurisdictional battles.

21:35.454 --> 21:36.787
Neither does the city.

21:36.789 --> 21:37.753
Understand?

21:37.777 --> 21:38.890
Yes, sir.

21:38.891 --> 21:40.257
Did you get a look
at the sniper?

21:40.259 --> 21:43.327
Tried to,
and then I got interrupted.

21:44.063 --> 21:45.262
We'll check surveillance,

21:45.264 --> 21:46.697
cell cameras, too.

21:46.699 --> 21:48.632
See if anyone saw him
rappeling down the building.

21:48.634 --> 21:51.735
Make sure the rope
and the bag get processed,

21:51.737 --> 21:53.604
sent to Sebastian,
along with the bullets.

21:53.606 --> 21:54.838
Sniper can't have done all this

21:54.840 --> 21:56.340
without leaving
something behind.

21:56.342 --> 21:58.142
Yeah. You got it.

21:58.144 --> 21:59.910
Do a deep dive into
the latest victim.

21:59.912 --> 22:02.346
There got to be a pattern
with the other vics; find it.

22:02.348 --> 22:04.314
Copy that.

22:05.384 --> 22:07.317
Look, Agent Pride,
I apologize

22:07.319 --> 22:09.153
if we got off on
the wrong foot.

22:09.155 --> 22:10.988
I'm from New York.
It happens.

22:10.990 --> 22:12.256
Not anymore.

22:12.258 --> 22:13.924
From this point on,
we work together.

22:13.926 --> 22:16.026
I want to know everything
you know about this case.

22:16.028 --> 22:17.961
The only thing
that matters to me

22:17.963 --> 22:21.732
is stopping the sniper before
anybody else gets hurt, capisce?

22:25.237 --> 22:26.470
REPORTER:
<i>Mr. Mayor!</i>

22:26.472 --> 22:27.838
Do you know who
the sniper is?

22:27.840 --> 22:29.306
Is there more than one?

22:29.308 --> 22:31.341
Mr. Mayor, what are you
doing to protect the city?

22:31.343 --> 22:32.543
Should people stay inside?

22:32.545 --> 22:34.011
Will you have to
cancel Fall Fest?

22:34.013 --> 22:35.979
No, no, no, no, no.
Just... no.

22:35.981 --> 22:38.382
No-Nobody's canceling
anything, okay?

22:38.384 --> 22:40.751
FBI, ATF, NOPD--

22:40.753 --> 22:42.753
we've got a coordinated
law enforcement effort

22:42.755 --> 22:44.121
blanketing the city.

22:44.123 --> 22:46.557
As a matter of fact, we almost
caught the bastard today.

22:46.559 --> 22:49.159
And I'm confident
we are on his heels.

22:49.161 --> 22:51.261
NCIS has assured me of that.

22:51.263 --> 22:54.364
Oh, great, put all the pressure
on us, why don't you.

22:54.366 --> 22:56.233
Yeah, he's just
a big ol' blowhard.

22:56.235 --> 22:59.069
Yeah, well all I know is
we got squat.

22:59.071 --> 23:00.671
Still nothing to connect
the victims.

23:00.673 --> 23:02.806
Nothing on surveillance.
The city's in a panic.

23:02.808 --> 23:03.874
Brody's gone.

23:03.876 --> 23:05.943
Now we got this snotty
FBI chick to deal with?

23:05.945 --> 23:08.112
- Hey, come on...
- Don't!

23:08.114 --> 23:10.581
Don't.

23:12.785 --> 23:14.718
Are we ever gonna
talk about it, Percy,

23:14.720 --> 23:16.754
or we just gonna pretend
like nothing ever happened?

23:16.756 --> 23:19.623
There's nothing to talk about.
It was just a stupid hug.

23:19.625 --> 23:21.892
A stupid hug, huh?

23:24.864 --> 23:25.696
Am I interrupting something?

23:25.698 --> 23:27.397
Yes.
No.

23:28.234 --> 23:30.634
Okay.

23:32.905 --> 23:35.038
Did you find the van?

23:35.040 --> 23:36.507
PATTON:
No. That's a ghost, too.

23:36.509 --> 23:38.342
But I think I may have found
something to connect

23:38.344 --> 23:39.843
at least two
of our murder victims.

23:39.845 --> 23:43.046
First one, the banker,
shot at the casino.

23:43.048 --> 23:44.782
Now, this guy was
seriously in debt

23:44.784 --> 23:46.250
up till about six months ago.

23:46.252 --> 23:48.418
Then all of a sudden,
he was flush with cash.

23:48.420 --> 23:50.954
Taking his lady friends
to five-star resorts,

23:50.956 --> 23:52.823
buying bling, living large.

23:52.825 --> 23:55.959
Same as our latest victim,
shot at Champions Square.

23:55.961 --> 23:57.494
Unless a postal worker is making

23:57.496 --> 23:58.529
way more scratch
than I'm aware of,

23:58.531 --> 24:00.697
this guy was living
the high life, too.

24:00.699 --> 24:02.099
Payoffs?

24:02.101 --> 24:04.701
(scoffs) Too big of
a coincidence not to be.

24:04.703 --> 24:06.670
The only problem
is our master chief.

24:06.672 --> 24:08.572
He doesn't fit the pattern.

24:08.574 --> 24:10.307
This guy never spent a dime
over his pay grade.

24:10.309 --> 24:11.308
(sighs)

24:11.310 --> 24:13.644
Which means we still got squat.

24:19.151 --> 24:20.984
Another kill shot?

24:20.986 --> 24:22.452
Severed aorta.

24:22.454 --> 24:24.755
Whoever your sniper is,
he's pretty consistent,

24:24.757 --> 24:26.156
I'll give him that.

24:26.158 --> 24:28.425
Single kill shot's
his signature.

24:28.427 --> 24:31.662
Helps him withdraw before being
detected by I.R. or acoustics.

24:31.664 --> 24:34.398
Means he could be ex-SWAT,
maybe military,

24:34.400 --> 24:36.233
especially considering
the specificity

24:36.235 --> 24:37.634
of his aim.

24:37.636 --> 24:41.438
This is Special Agent Gregorio,
FBI.

24:41.440 --> 24:44.007
D.C. sent her down
to lend us a hand.

24:44.009 --> 24:45.542
D.C.?

24:45.544 --> 24:47.144
Dr. Loretta Wade.

24:47.146 --> 24:48.478
Nice to meet you.

24:48.480 --> 24:49.780
Likewise.

24:49.782 --> 24:51.615
I take it
you're an expert on snipers.

24:51.617 --> 24:54.985
Trained sharpshooter myself--
one of only a few female agents.

24:54.987 --> 24:57.521
My divisional specialty
is actually counterterrorism

24:57.523 --> 24:59.289
and behavioral profiling,

24:59.291 --> 25:02.226
but obviously sniper
activity is a sub-specialty.

25:02.228 --> 25:03.894
Obviously.

25:03.896 --> 25:07.631
You said his signature
is a single kill shot,

25:07.633 --> 25:09.333
but our sniper
injures others, too.

25:09.335 --> 25:11.602
His first shot is
to cover his motive,

25:11.604 --> 25:13.203
make us think it's random.

25:13.205 --> 25:14.671
Then, after the
kill shot, he's gone.

25:14.673 --> 25:16.840
And public hysteria
only helps his cover.

25:16.842 --> 25:19.476
Media, too, which is why
he never uses a silencer.

25:19.478 --> 25:21.845
The more people panic,
the less they witness.

25:21.847 --> 25:23.013
Go into survival mode.

25:23.015 --> 25:24.514
He knows exactly
what he's doing.

25:24.516 --> 25:26.183
That's why he's
so difficult to detect.

25:26.185 --> 25:27.851
May I?

25:27.853 --> 25:30.320
I've incorporated
several factors

25:30.322 --> 25:32.222
in my preliminary
profile to try

25:32.224 --> 25:34.124
and optimize
search strategy.

25:34.126 --> 25:36.960
Preferred location,
desire for anonymity,

25:36.962 --> 25:38.829
supersonic signature of rounds.

25:38.831 --> 25:40.163
Uh, who-who's she?

25:40.165 --> 25:41.531
GREGORIO: And assuming
he's the best of the best,

25:41.533 --> 25:43.800
loves a challenge,
I was able to narrow down

25:43.802 --> 25:45.269
my suspect list
as well as

25:45.271 --> 25:47.104
potential hunting areas.

25:47.106 --> 25:48.572
Fortunately, I was already
near the first one

25:48.574 --> 25:49.573
when he struck.

25:49.575 --> 25:51.541
Wait.

25:51.543 --> 25:54.544
So, you were in town
before the first attack?

25:56.315 --> 25:59.082
Which means...

25:59.084 --> 26:02.920
D.C. didn't send you
because of all this.

26:05.991 --> 26:10.060
You didn't come down here
to investigate the sniper.

26:10.062 --> 26:12.896
You came down here
to investigate us.

26:31.066 --> 26:33.132
CHARLENE: I need that
report on my desk ASAP.

26:33.134 --> 26:34.901
Charlene, why
didn't you tell me

26:34.903 --> 26:36.436
D.C. was down
here already?

26:36.438 --> 26:37.837
Dwayne, listen, I...
When I called before

26:37.839 --> 26:40.873
about us working together,
why didn't you say something?

26:40.875 --> 26:42.909
Listen, Dwayne, I wanted
to tell you, believe me,

26:42.911 --> 26:43.825
but I'm in an
awkward position.

26:43.849 --> 26:44.712
Awkward, how?

26:44.713 --> 26:46.279
Damn it, Charlene,
we go way back,

26:46.281 --> 26:48.181
and I think I deserve
the courtesy of...

26:48.183 --> 26:49.682
I...
It wasn't her call.

26:49.684 --> 26:50.683
It was mine.

26:50.685 --> 26:51.884
Who the hell are you?

26:51.886 --> 26:54.587
I'm Executive Assistant Director
Raymond Isler.

26:54.589 --> 26:57.023
I'm with the FBI's National
Security Branch in D.C.

26:57.025 --> 27:00.093
Shall we chat?

27:12.741 --> 27:14.307
How long you been down here?

27:14.309 --> 27:16.142
ISLER: The DOJ sent us down
two weeks ago,

27:16.144 --> 27:18.478
right after your team was
placed on administrative leave.

27:18.480 --> 27:19.746
Why wasn't I told?

27:19.748 --> 27:21.380
Oh, we weren't
keeping it from you,

27:21.382 --> 27:22.949
but you were on vacation.

27:24.419 --> 27:26.319
Forget how to use a cell?

27:26.321 --> 27:29.455
A DHS mole infiltrated
your team, Agent Pride,

27:29.457 --> 27:32.225
used one of your own agents
to nearly pull off

27:32.227 --> 27:33.693
a disastrous terror attack

27:33.695 --> 27:35.328
that would've blocked
the Mississippi River.

27:35.330 --> 27:36.863
An attack my team stopped.

27:36.865 --> 27:38.231
Barely.

27:39.400 --> 27:42.268
By the way,
w-where is Agent Brody?

27:42.270 --> 27:45.605
We haven't been able
to contact her yet.

27:45.607 --> 27:47.673
Still on vacation.

27:47.675 --> 27:49.242
Look, nobody's accusing
you or your people

27:49.244 --> 27:50.443
of being complicit.

27:51.513 --> 27:53.346
But because
Brody was compromised

27:53.348 --> 27:55.414
and because your
NCIS team is responsible

27:55.416 --> 27:57.116
for overseeing
one of the most

27:57.118 --> 28:00.953
vulnerable entry points into

is warranted.

28:08.029 --> 28:09.362
This isn't D.C.

It's okay, Gregorio.

28:21.976 --> 28:23.009
I was just

28:23.011 --> 28:25.178
filling Agent Pride in.

28:30.151 --> 28:32.952
Intel discovered
that he

and the Ciudad Natal cartel
had embedded accomplices

28:35.890 --> 28:38.491
in the area-- inside help.

Yeah, thought we had

but master chief
messed that all up.

29:56.404 --> 29:58.137
That's why I've been thinking,

29:58.139 --> 29:59.138
maybe he wasn't

29:59.140 --> 30:00.373
the intended target.

30:00.375 --> 30:02.508

30:10.018 --> 30:12.285
I don't think
Patton checked him out.

30:12.287 --> 30:14.487
So, you think the sniper
was aiming at Gilbert,

30:14.489 --> 30:16.355
but the master chief
just got in the way?

30:16.357 --> 30:17.857
Bullet went right
through him,

30:17.859 --> 30:20.459
into Gilbert, nearly
killed them both.

Expert marksman,
high-powered rifle,

on the second.

30:29.170 --> 30:31.370
I think you might be
onto something, King.

30:31.372 --> 30:34.373
Looks like Gilbert was living
way above his means, too.

30:34.375 --> 30:37.777
Look, he bought
a beachfront condo-- cash.

30:40.214 --> 30:43.249
If we eliminate the master
chief from the equation,

30:43.251 --> 30:44.717
we got a clear pattern.

30:44.719 --> 30:46.052
Each of the intended targets

30:46.054 --> 30:47.753
were getting payoffs
from somebody.

30:47.755 --> 30:49.288
Somebody who wants
to cover their tracks

30:49.290 --> 30:51.190
by silencing them
permanently.

30:51.192 --> 30:53.492
Still, it's a stretch to think
the sniper intentionally aimed

30:53.494 --> 30:55.695
at the master chief
to get to the restaurant owner.

30:55.697 --> 30:57.430
May not have
had a choice.

about to take him to safety.

39:30.650 --> 39:34.351
just... a little smaller is all.

39:36.088 --> 39:38.155
Okay, so...
(sighs)

39:38.157 --> 39:41.892
Let's go. We got a burlesque
competition to go to.

39:41.894 --> 39:44.361
Wait. What was that?
- Uh...

39:44.363 --> 39:47.130
I offered up the bar.

39:47.132 --> 39:49.533
Uh, they roped me into it.

39:49.535 --> 39:50.967
Don't give me any guff.

39:50.969 --> 39:53.136
Oh, I'm not making
any promises.

39:53.138 --> 39:55.672
(chuckles)
Show must go on.

39:55.674 --> 39:57.507
Oh!

39:57.509 --> 39:59.776
BOTH:
After you.

40:03.548 --> 40:05.448
(sultry jazz music playing,
lively chatter)

40:14.793 --> 40:16.659
Why didn't Merri call?

40:16.661 --> 40:17.682
She should've called.

40:17.682 --> 40:18.362
Come on, Sebastian.

40:18.362 --> 40:20.629
Man up. It's not like
you got dumped or something.

40:20.631 --> 40:24.467
I sure as heck
<i>did</i> get dumped, man.

40:24.469 --> 40:27.002
Doesn't matter that
we didn't actually date.

40:27.004 --> 40:28.704
You, uh, want me
to call him a cab?

40:28.706 --> 40:29.871
More like a shrink.

40:29.873 --> 40:31.307
SEBASTIAN:
Should've asked her out

40:31.309 --> 40:33.209
is what I should've done.
She would've stayed

40:33.211 --> 40:34.374
if I had asked her out.

40:34.398 --> 40:35.945
Mm-hmm.

40:35.946 --> 40:37.378
Night, night.

40:38.849 --> 40:41.917
SONJA:
(sighs) Poor guy.

40:41.919 --> 40:44.052
He's gonna feel
even worse in the morning.

40:44.054 --> 40:45.253
(chuckles)

40:48.291 --> 40:51.159
Yow-uh!

40:51.161 --> 40:52.960
Yeah. (laughing)

40:56.032 --> 40:56.956
Loretta.

40:56.980 --> 40:58.267
Hmm?

40:58.268 --> 41:00.735
Don't tell me you're here
for the burlesque, too.

41:00.737 --> 41:02.670
Oh, what?
Can't a woman enjoy

41:02.672 --> 41:05.039
the fine art
of satirical theater?

41:05.041 --> 41:07.308
(laughs):
Okay. Is that what it is?

41:07.310 --> 41:09.844
I appreciate art
in any form.

41:09.846 --> 41:11.545
Well, I'll drink to that.

41:11.547 --> 41:12.647
Tap, boss?

41:12.649 --> 41:14.548
Thanks, Buckley.
And by the way...

41:14.550 --> 41:17.718
you did a nice job
cleaning up the squad room.

41:17.720 --> 41:18.953
Oh. Least I can do.

41:18.955 --> 41:20.354
Appreciate it.

41:20.356 --> 41:21.622
(Wade sighs)

41:21.624 --> 41:24.291
How is everybody holding up?

41:24.293 --> 41:26.193
Talking about Brody?

41:26.895 --> 41:28.128
Too early to tell.

41:28.130 --> 41:30.697
How are <i>you</i> holding up?

41:31.567 --> 41:34.000
Uh, well.

41:34.002 --> 41:36.770
Trying to take the
advice of a wise woman.

41:36.772 --> 41:40.774
Working on
letting myself off the hook.

41:40.776 --> 41:41.908
Oh!

41:41.910 --> 41:44.377
Seems like a <i>very</i> wise woman.

41:44.379 --> 41:46.846
Come on, Dwayne,
we're short a judge.

41:46.848 --> 41:48.548
Oh, no, yeah. Uh, that's okay.

41:48.550 --> 41:49.783
No, I'm just here to...
Oh, come on.

41:49.785 --> 41:51.250
You don't want to let
NOLA down, do you?

41:51.252 --> 41:51.922
Let's go.

41:51.946 --> 41:53.054
Oh, God. Okay.

41:53.055 --> 41:54.420
(laughs)

41:54.422 --> 41:56.656
(sultry jazz music playing,
crowd cheering)

42:00.395 --> 42:02.061
(wolf whistles)

42:08.869 --> 42:10.369
Ah!

42:16.343 --> 42:17.475
(laughs)
