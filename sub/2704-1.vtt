00:43.413 --> 00:47.243
<i>There's a legend</i>
<i>of a man who lives beneath the sea.</i>

00:47.313 --> 00:49.211
<i>He is a fisher of men,</i>

00:49.513 --> 00:53.172
<i>the last hope of all those</i>
<i>who have been left behind.</i>

00:53.246 --> 00:56.769
<i>Many survivors claim to have felt</i>
<i>his gripping hands beneath them,</i>

00:56.845 --> 00:58.777
<i>pushing them up to the surface,</i>

00:58.845 --> 01:02.005
<i>whispering strength</i>
<i>until help could arrive.</i>

01:02.079 --> 01:05.408
<i>But this, of course, is only a legend.</i>

01:09.345 --> 01:10.742
Help!

01:11.512 --> 01:12.875
Over here!

01:17.078 --> 01:18.237
Sherilyn!

01:18.411 --> 01:19.434
Help!

01:19.511 --> 01:22.443
Ma'am, I'm a Coast Guard
rescue swimmer.

01:22.511 --> 01:24.033
I'm here to help you.

01:25.311 --> 01:29.709
Sir, stay with your flotation.
I'll be back for you.

01:29.777 --> 01:31.834
- Don't leave me!
- Just stay there.

01:31.910 --> 01:33.967
Don't you leave me!

01:37.677 --> 01:39.836
<i>Basket is outside</i>
<i>the cabin door and going down.</i>

01:39.910 --> 01:40.932
<i>Roger. Copy you.</i>

01:41.009 --> 01:43.941
<i>Forward and right 30.</i>
<i>Forward and right 15.</i>

01:44.009 --> 01:44.997
<i>Right 15.</i>

01:45.076 --> 01:46.064
<i>Ho, ho, ho!</i>

01:46.876 --> 01:49.035
<i>Basket is in the water.</i>

01:49.109 --> 01:51.075
<i>Swimmer and survivor</i>
<i>are at the basket.</i>

01:51.143 --> 01:53.006
Put your head in first.

01:56.642 --> 01:58.039
I gotta get out!

01:58.108 --> 01:59.335
<i>Easy, forward.</i>

02:00.175 --> 02:02.868
Let go! Let go.

02:03.108 --> 02:05.539
Let go. You're drowning her!

02:10.241 --> 02:12.764
<i>Swimmer just popped him in the face.</i>

02:16.241 --> 02:18.798
<i>Okay, he's putting the man</i>
<i>in the basket.</i>

02:18.874 --> 02:20.669
<i>The man is in the basket.</i>

02:20.974 --> 02:22.872
<i>We're taking the load.</i>

02:27.640 --> 02:28.936
<i>Whoa, big wave.</i>

02:34.340 --> 02:36.465
Get out! Get out!
What's wrong with you?

02:36.540 --> 02:38.199
Sit there and shut up.

02:58.039 --> 02:59.198
<i>Swimmer in sight.</i>

03:03.538 --> 03:05.299
<i>Prepare to take the load.</i>

03:05.371 --> 03:07.360
<i>I have the ready-for-pickup signal.</i>

03:15.804 --> 03:18.395
<i>Swimmer is approaching cabin door.</i>

03:19.004 --> 03:20.970
<i>Survivor looks unconscious.</i>

03:22.637 --> 03:24.728
<i>Swimmer inside the cabin door.</i>

03:26.870 --> 03:29.063
<i>Cabin door closing.</i>

03:43.303 --> 03:44.996
I think you just broke my nose.

03:45.069 --> 03:47.728
And you may have killed your wife, sir.

03:49.635 --> 03:50.965
<i>Twenty minutes to Kodiak.</i>

03:51.036 --> 03:53.797
<i>Roger.</i>
<i>He's giving her CPR.</i>

03:53.969 --> 03:56.662
<i>Comstate Kodiak,</i>
<i>this is Coast Guard 6096.</i>

03:56.735 --> 03:59.360
<i>We have</i>
<i>two hypothermic survivors onboard.</i>

03:59.435 --> 04:00.458
<i>We'll be there in 20 minutes.</i>

04:00.535 --> 04:03.557
<i>Requesting to have an ambulance</i>
<i>on-scene when we land.</i>

04:23.500 --> 04:24.796
Whoa, there we go.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.625
- <i>Got her?</i>
- Got her!

04:44.365 --> 04:45.922
Attaway, baby.

04:47.198 --> 04:48.596
There's dead,

04:51.865 --> 04:53.525
then there's dead.

04:54.898 --> 04:57.057
I swear,
you get better with age.

05:24.163 --> 05:26.459
- Had to hit him, huh?
- Yeah.

05:27.063 --> 05:29.824
You are not. You stay over there!
You stay over there!

05:31.829 --> 05:34.886
Seems like it's always the big ones
that crack.

05:36.963 --> 05:38.053
Lieutenant.

05:38.129 --> 05:41.788
Crew said that she went under.
They thought you'd lost her.

05:42.195 --> 05:44.252
Lucky guess.

05:45.429 --> 05:47.292
Luck, my ass.

06:08.827 --> 06:11.657
- I didn't think you were serious.
- Of course you didn't, Ben.

06:11.727 --> 06:13.386
How could you possibly think
I was serious?

06:13.460 --> 06:15.653
I'm not some nameless
drowning victim.

06:15.726 --> 06:19.658
Oh, gee, I'm sorry saving lives
doesn't jive with our social...

06:21.160 --> 06:22.148
That's...

06:24.293 --> 06:25.418
That's my chair.

06:25.493 --> 06:27.550
Oh, he's right. Not that chair.

06:28.593 --> 06:33.287
I'm sorry. I was just pointing things out
in the living room. He didn't know.

06:33.892 --> 06:36.154
I would never take your chair.

06:43.425 --> 06:45.186
Pick it up, would...

06:48.058 --> 06:49.785
Doesn't have to be messy, Ben.

06:49.858 --> 06:53.291
It's clean, simple for both of us.
We don't have kids.

06:56.491 --> 06:58.457
Well, what about Friday?

07:00.925 --> 07:02.220
What about Friday?

07:02.291 --> 07:04.723
We were gonna go
with Carl and Bridget, you know,

07:04.790 --> 07:08.154
to that dinner-dance thing at the base.

07:09.723 --> 07:12.281
The base? All-you-can-eat wings?

07:12.356 --> 07:15.948
A dart game to settle the tab?
That's the date that we can't break?

07:16.024 --> 07:18.114
- You're right. You're right.
- Wow.

07:18.189 --> 07:22.417
Look, we'll... We'll go away, all right?
Just us.

07:23.056 --> 07:24.215
It's too late, Ben.

07:24.290 --> 07:27.085
I don't know what I can say to you
that I haven't said already.

07:27.156 --> 07:29.587
It's time for me to rescue myself.

07:36.955 --> 07:39.716
Maybe... Maybe I should be the one
to move out.

07:39.788 --> 07:40.879
<i>Hi, you've reached Helen.</i>

07:40.955 --> 07:42.080
<i>And Ben.</i>

07:42.155 --> 07:43.178
<i>Leave a message.</i>

07:43.255 --> 07:45.379
You don't even know where anything is
in this house.

07:45.454 --> 07:46.613
It's much easier this way.

07:46.688 --> 07:49.153
<i>Senior Chief, please report to base.</i>

07:50.187 --> 07:53.278
I can... I can fix this, all right? I...

07:54.588 --> 07:56.019
I can...

07:57.720 --> 07:59.277
I can fix this.

08:01.021 --> 08:02.987
Just tell me what to do.

08:03.687 --> 08:05.414
Tell me what to do.

08:11.853 --> 08:13.513
- Just let me go.
- No.

08:14.320 --> 08:16.649
- Just let me go.
- No.

08:24.853 --> 08:26.785
You should answer that.

08:29.085 --> 08:33.017
<i>Ready rescue helo 6096.</i>
<i>Swimmer One, return to base.</i>

08:34.184 --> 08:36.980
- I don't wanna lose her.
- Then change.

08:37.052 --> 08:39.711
Ben, how many times
have we had this conversation?

08:39.784 --> 08:43.808
The only way for you to save it
is to give this up and fly a desk.

08:44.718 --> 08:47.513
Exactly. She just wants to live.

08:49.184 --> 08:52.014
Hey, maybe we can get a hobby.
Both of us.

08:52.651 --> 08:54.549
Something like fishing.

08:54.984 --> 08:56.177
- Fishing?
- Yeah.

08:56.250 --> 08:58.614
Guys like us don't fish, Carl.

08:58.684 --> 09:00.843
It'll work out. Always does.

09:02.350 --> 09:06.339
Let me ask you something, seriously.
Is it too soon for me to ask her out?

09:06.550 --> 09:07.845
I guess so.

09:10.917 --> 09:12.815
<i>Mayday! Mayday!</i>
<i>Mayday!</i>

09:12.883 --> 09:14.872
<i>This is cargo vessel</i> Seaqueen.

09:15.483 --> 09:18.643
<i>We're at 55 degrees,</i>
<i>12 minutes north.</i>

09:18.716 --> 09:21.477
<i>167 degrees, 10 minutes west.</i>

09:23.016 --> 09:24.141
<i>We're taking on water.</i>

09:24.749 --> 09:28.011
We're abandoning ship.
I repeat, abandoning ship.

09:35.248 --> 09:38.544
Son, look at me. Look at me.
You're gonna be okay. Got that?

09:38.615 --> 09:40.739
Got that? We're gonna be okay.

09:41.415 --> 09:42.903
Okay.

09:57.880 --> 09:59.971
<i>We have</i>
<i>a tail rotor de-ice caution light.</i>

10:00.047 --> 10:01.172
- <i>Any secondaries?</i>
- <i>No.</i>

10:01.247 --> 10:03.337
<i>Circuit breakers are in,</i>
<i>so it definitely has failed,</i>

10:03.413 --> 10:04.845
<i>but we're not building up any ice.</i>

10:04.914 --> 10:08.311
- <i>How's the fuel?</i>
- <i>Forty minutes to bingo.</i>

10:08.380 --> 10:10.676
- <i>All right, take the stick.</i>
- <i>Okay, I have the controls.</i>

10:10.747 --> 10:12.144
<i>All right, huddle time, boys.</i>

10:12.213 --> 10:14.576
<i>We have a de-ice fail.</i>
<i>We're low on fuel.</i>

10:14.646 --> 10:18.408
<i>The rulebook says we cut our losses.</i>
<i>What do you think, Ben?</i>

10:18.879 --> 10:21.436
<i>Well, we go home, they die, Bill.</i>

10:25.178 --> 10:28.905
<i>Ops Cent Kodiak, Ops Cent</i>
<i>Kodiak, this is Coast Guard 6096.</i>

10:28.978 --> 10:30.944
<i>We have</i>
<i>a tail rotor de-ice caution light,</i>

10:31.012 --> 10:32.478
<i>but we are pressing on.</i>

10:32.544 --> 10:35.102
6096, keep us updated on your status.

10:35.178 --> 10:36.973
- <i>6096...</i>
- Get the maintenance chief on the line.

10:37.045 --> 10:38.476
I wanna know
what he thinks about this.

10:56.877 --> 10:59.365
<i>Computer's saying</i>
<i>the winds are 60 to 85 knots.</i>

10:59.443 --> 11:00.704
<i>I'm turning your bear alt off.</i>

11:00.777 --> 11:03.265
- <i>You're on your own with altitude hold.</i>
- <i>Roger.</i>

11:03.343 --> 11:05.831
<i>Lower! Lower!</i>
<i>Right side. Debris in water.</i>

11:05.910 --> 11:08.603
- <i>Request to open cabin door.</i>
- <i>Roger. Open door.</i>

11:10.442 --> 11:12.431
<i>Kodiak Ops,</i>
<i>6096 is on-scene.</i>

11:12.509 --> 11:15.407
<i>We have heavy debris in the water.</i>
<i>Commencing cover search.</i>

11:30.575 --> 11:32.063
<i>Mark and note position.</i>

11:33.842 --> 11:35.330
<i>I'm going in.</i>

11:38.408 --> 11:41.464
<i>They're dead, Ben. Ben, they're dead!</i>

11:41.540 --> 11:43.268
We don't know that.

11:43.540 --> 11:46.370
<i>There's six PIWs all tied together.</i>
<i>No signs of life.</i>

11:47.507 --> 11:48.871
I think we may be too late.

11:48.941 --> 11:51.997
Not our call. They're on-scene.
They'll make the assessment.

11:52.440 --> 11:54.167
<i>Requesting to get wet, sir.</i>

11:54.240 --> 11:56.671
<i>I ain't sending you fishing for bodies,</i>
<i>not in this.</i>

11:56.740 --> 11:59.172
<i>Well, how about fathers and sons?</i>

12:01.673 --> 12:05.230
<i>Flare! Flare! We got a live one here.</i>
<i>We got a live one!</i>

12:07.939 --> 12:11.235
<i>You got five minutes,</i>
<i>then we're hauling your ass back up.</i>

12:11.306 --> 12:13.431
<i>Kodiak Ops,</i>
<i>this is Coast Guard 6096.</i>

12:13.505 --> 12:15.937
<i>We have people in the water,</i>
<i>and we are deploying our swimmer.</i>

12:16.006 --> 12:18.165
6096, Kodiak Ops, copy.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.670
<i>One's holding the flare.</i>
<i>I see no other movement.</i>

12:20.739 --> 12:21.762
<i>Roger that.</i>

12:21.839 --> 12:23.134
<i>Swimmer's ready to deploy.</i>

12:23.205 --> 12:26.262
- <i>Check swimmer.</i>
- <i>Roger. Checking swimmer.</i>

12:29.871 --> 12:32.564
<i>Swimmer's dressed out.</i>
<i>Checklist is complete.</i>

12:32.638 --> 12:34.104
<i>Five minutes.</i>

12:37.871 --> 12:39.496
<i>Swimmer's away.</i>

12:47.237 --> 12:48.294
<i>Swimmer's okay.</i>

12:48.371 --> 12:51.598
- <i>Clear to move back and left 30.</i>
- <i>Clear back and left.</i>

13:11.636 --> 13:13.033
<i>How we looking</i>
<i>on fuel there?</i>

13:13.102 --> 13:15.330
<i>Two minutes to bingo.</i>

13:22.102 --> 13:24.795
I'm a Coast Guard rescue swimmer
here to help you, son.

13:24.868 --> 13:28.561
You're gonna be okay.
I'm gonna get you in that helicopter.

13:33.368 --> 13:36.163
- <i>I have the ready-for-pickup signal.</i>
- <i>Roger.</i>

13:41.400 --> 13:44.195
<i>Basket is going out the cabin door.</i>

13:45.267 --> 13:47.062
<i>Bingo. We're at bingo. Gotta go.</i>

13:47.133 --> 13:48.463
<i>Ease it back.</i>

13:49.333 --> 13:52.493
- <i>Basket is in the water!</i>
- <i>We're out of time. We gotta go, Carl.</i>

13:52.567 --> 13:55.623
<i>Hold position. Steady. Hold.</i>

13:55.699 --> 13:57.562
<i>He's putting the survivor in the basket.</i>

13:57.633 --> 13:59.360
<i>Your rad alt's going crazy.</i>

13:59.432 --> 14:02.262
<i>Yeah, yeah, I know.</i>
<i>I'm all over the place.</i>

14:06.965 --> 14:08.794
<i>Come on, Carl, we gotta go now!</i>

14:08.865 --> 14:11.127
<i>I don't have</i>
<i>a ready-for-pickup signal yet.</i>

14:13.598 --> 14:16.064
Whoa! Carl! Behind you!

14:16.132 --> 14:17.461
<i>Holy shit!</i>

14:19.665 --> 14:21.290
<i>We lost our tail rotor!</i>

14:24.632 --> 14:26.564
<i>Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!</i>

14:29.464 --> 14:31.692
<i>Coast Guard 6096 is going down!</i>

14:31.764 --> 14:33.992
<i>Mayday! Mayday! 6096 is going in.</i>

15:18.661 --> 15:20.854
Carl. I'm here.

15:20.928 --> 15:21.916
Carl.

15:24.095 --> 15:26.993
Hold on, Carl. Hold on.

15:28.427 --> 15:30.416
They'll be coming for us.

15:33.160 --> 15:35.682
I got you. You're okay now.

15:36.526 --> 15:38.754
You're okay. I'm here, Carl.

15:40.326 --> 15:42.849
We're okay. Hang on. I got you.

15:44.059 --> 15:47.617
- You think they're coming?
- Oh, yeah, they're coming.

15:50.493 --> 15:52.754
I want a C-130
over that crash site now.

15:52.826 --> 15:54.758
Lieutenant Krauss,
start the mishap checklist.

15:54.826 --> 15:55.814
Aye, Captain.

15:55.893 --> 15:57.722
Captain, I've got an EPIRB hit
on Randall's survivor suit.

15:57.792 --> 15:59.781
Launch ready helos. Swimmer provide.

15:59.859 --> 16:03.018
We have a C-130 coming off a case
off Attu. It's already low on fuel.

16:03.092 --> 16:04.524
I don't care. Have them cut an engine.

16:04.592 --> 16:06.182
I want him to know
he's not alone out there.

16:10.591 --> 16:12.716
Listen. Listen.

16:14.791 --> 16:16.347
You hear that?

16:31.790 --> 16:35.779
Hold on, Carl.
Here we go, Carl. I got you.

16:37.923 --> 16:39.287
What's the ETA on the backup helo?

16:39.357 --> 16:40.380
Helo's en route to Cold Bay.

16:40.457 --> 16:42.184
They should be on-scene,
three, maybe four hours.

16:42.257 --> 16:43.280
Make it three.

16:56.589 --> 17:00.316
Jesus. How much more of that stuff
do you think I got in me?

17:01.022 --> 17:02.612
Feel that?

17:03.822 --> 17:05.753
- You feel that?
- Yeah.

17:05.821 --> 17:08.845
That means you're alive.
I'm not gonna let go.

17:10.722 --> 17:14.586
- Don't you!
- I'm not gonna. I'm not gonna.

18:08.252 --> 18:09.808
serious fractures,
like in the C-spine,

18:09.885 --> 18:11.283
which could cause paralysis.

18:11.351 --> 18:14.909
Mostly what we see is old fractures
in the arms, also in the leg,

18:14.985 --> 18:17.849
but nothing acute.
Nothing new with this injury, luckily.

18:18.684 --> 18:20.411
We just hope the kidneys kick in

18:20.484 --> 18:22.779
and start to help him
resolve a lot of that fluid.

18:22.850 --> 18:24.373
Thank you very much.

19:03.314 --> 19:06.042
We've been friends a long time,
haven't we?

19:06.114 --> 19:08.137
I've always been good to you,
haven't I?

19:08.214 --> 19:11.442
Didn't promote you to a desk when
you turned 40 like everybody else.

19:11.514 --> 19:12.537
That's right.

19:12.615 --> 19:15.671
All right,
so now I need you to listen to me.

19:15.747 --> 19:16.872
Okay.

19:18.413 --> 19:20.379
There's an instructor opening
at "A" School, that...

19:20.447 --> 19:22.640
No. The answer is no.

19:22.714 --> 19:25.043
You just said you'd listen. Sit down.

19:25.547 --> 19:27.479
I'm not interested, Captain.

19:27.547 --> 19:31.001
Well, it's no longer a request,
Senior Chief. Sit down.

19:31.080 --> 19:32.602
You're serious?

19:40.312 --> 19:42.244
You have two choices.

19:42.312 --> 19:45.574
Sign the papers today and you can
live life as a civilian here in Kodiak,

19:45.646 --> 19:47.373
if that's what you want.

19:48.045 --> 19:51.602
Or you can take that "A" School
opening I'm offering you.

19:51.678 --> 19:53.610
I've already spoken to command
down there.

19:53.678 --> 19:56.576
It will be your class.
You will be in charge.

19:56.645 --> 19:59.440
You can take the time
to work your way back into shape.

19:59.511 --> 20:00.738
I am in shape.

20:00.812 --> 20:03.800
God damn it,
that's not what I'm talking about.

20:05.944 --> 20:08.876
Ben, all I'm asking is that
you go down there for a few months.

20:08.944 --> 20:11.501
You work with the kids, you recharge.

20:11.577 --> 20:15.134
Download that epic résumé
where it's gonna do some good.

20:17.844 --> 20:20.900
You can't always be
the one in the water, Ben.

20:20.977 --> 20:23.568
You'll know
when you're ready to come back.

21:10.608 --> 21:13.233
You people got 15 seconds
to get off this bus.

21:13.307 --> 21:16.171
Move! Move! Let's go! Get off the bus!

21:29.906 --> 21:31.963
Hurry up.
Let's go, let's go.

21:36.439 --> 21:38.065
Put your white books
in your red bags.

21:38.505 --> 21:41.027
Let's get that squared away now.
Put those books away.

21:41.105 --> 21:43.503
Females,
grab your bags, fall out to the rear.

21:43.572 --> 21:45.561
Follow Chief Flight
and Petty Officer Hall.

21:45.639 --> 21:48.366
The rest of you, pick a bunk,
put on your ODUs.

21:48.439 --> 21:50.904
You started with 15 minutes,
you are now down to 12.

21:50.972 --> 21:53.961
Move! Move, move, move!

21:55.371 --> 21:57.667
Move it out. Get changed
out of those working blues.

21:57.738 --> 21:59.465
Hurry up. Move it out.

21:59.538 --> 22:01.663
Find your rack. Quit wasting my time.

22:01.737 --> 22:05.033
Hey. Hey! That's my stuff, man.

22:05.271 --> 22:07.429
Hey, that's his bunk.

22:08.104 --> 22:09.797
You two a couple?

22:11.570 --> 22:14.661
It's okay. I like the top better anyway.

22:17.103 --> 22:18.762
<i>Out of the 39,000</i>
<i>men and women</i>

22:18.836 --> 22:20.665
<i>who make up</i>
<i>the United States Coast Guard,</i>

22:20.736 --> 22:23.668
<i>there are only 280 rescue swimmers.</i>

22:23.736 --> 22:25.066
Let's go! Let's go, mermaids!

22:25.136 --> 22:27.125
<i>This is because</i>
<i>we are the Coast Guard's elite.</i>

22:27.202 --> 22:29.066
<i>We are the best of the best.</i>

22:29.135 --> 22:32.465
<i>When storms shut down entire ports,</i>
<i>we go out.</i>

22:32.935 --> 22:36.390
<i>When hurricanes ground</i>
<i>the United States Navy, we go out.</i>

22:36.469 --> 22:39.060
<i>And when the holy Lord himself</i>
<i>reaches down from heaven</i>

22:39.135 --> 22:43.067
and destroys his good work with winds
that rip houses off the ground,

22:43.368 --> 22:45.231
we go out.

22:46.201 --> 22:49.827
And the attrition rate at this school
is well over 50%.

22:49.901 --> 22:54.561
So if by some miracle you actually
have what it takes to become one of us,

22:55.235 --> 22:59.065
then you get to live a life of meager pay

22:59.134 --> 23:03.259
with the distinct possibility
of dying slow, cold and alone

23:03.634 --> 23:05.156
somewhere in the vast sea.

23:06.267 --> 23:09.631
However, you also get the chance
to save lives,

23:10.567 --> 23:13.964
and there is no greater calling
in the world than that.

23:14.033 --> 23:18.431
So, ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
Welcome to "A" School.

23:19.033 --> 23:21.055
Are there any questions?

23:22.800 --> 23:26.197
Captain, Airman Fischer.
Just have one question.

23:27.032 --> 23:30.486
That guy who holds all them records,
is he still alive?

23:30.765 --> 23:31.992
Why do you ask?

23:32.066 --> 23:33.588
I just thought you ought to let him know

23:33.665 --> 23:35.426
I'm about to knock his name
off that board.

23:35.498 --> 23:37.896
Really?
Why don't you let him know yourself?

23:37.966 --> 23:41.420
He's standing right behind you
in the back of the room.

23:41.765 --> 23:45.197
Class, turn around
and greet Senior Chief Ben Randall.

23:46.131 --> 23:50.722
Senior Chief Randall will be your
lead instructor for the next 18 weeks.

23:50.798 --> 23:54.423
Senior Chief Randall is one of
the most decorated rescue swimmers

23:54.497 --> 23:57.588
in the history
of the United States Coast Guard.

23:59.164 --> 24:01.789
Ben, would you care
to address the class?

24:01.864 --> 24:04.796
No, I think there's been enough talk
for one day.

24:04.864 --> 24:07.523
Chief Skinner, they're all yours.

24:07.597 --> 24:09.495
Attention on deck.

24:09.563 --> 24:11.495
- Carry on.
- Aye, Captain.

24:12.797 --> 24:15.592
PT test begins at 0700 tomorrow.

24:15.663 --> 24:17.890
Class dismissed.
You will file through the front door.

24:17.963 --> 24:19.486
First row first, followed by the second.

24:19.562 --> 24:21.028
Frank.

24:22.429 --> 24:25.191
"When God rips houses
off the ground"?

24:26.329 --> 24:27.852
I was rolling.

24:28.362 --> 24:30.987
And I didn't mean
to put you on the spot up there.

24:31.796 --> 24:34.727
And I was real sorry
to hear about your crew.

24:35.262 --> 24:37.489
Come on. I'll show you around.

24:38.362 --> 24:41.452
- So I hear you're staying in a single?
- Yeah.

24:42.195 --> 24:45.558
Helen's got some family business
she's gotta take care of up there.

24:48.328 --> 24:50.226
<i>Mayday, mayday, mayday!</i>

24:50.661 --> 24:53.320
<i>This is</i> Ballmariner! Ballmariner!

24:53.794 --> 24:57.090
<i>We are on fire! We are on fire!</i>

25:19.793 --> 25:20.850
Go!

25:20.925 --> 25:23.891
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!
- Let's go, logs.

25:24.226 --> 25:26.249
Let's move it out! Let's move it out!

25:26.326 --> 25:28.621
Work as a team! Work as a team!

25:30.458 --> 25:31.515
- Two lines.
- Two lines.

25:31.592 --> 25:32.888
- Two lines.
- Two lines.

25:54.357 --> 25:55.721
Do you understand me?

25:55.791 --> 25:57.154
Yes, Petty Officer Hall.

25:57.224 --> 25:59.849
Very well, let's try it. Lean and rest!

26:02.023 --> 26:03.613
Pop tall.

26:04.123 --> 26:05.214
Oorah!

26:05.290 --> 26:06.755
- What the hell was that?
- That was terrible.

26:06.823 --> 26:07.811
That was the worst
I've ever seen.

26:07.890 --> 26:08.878
That was terrible.

26:08.957 --> 26:10.445
Let's try that again.

26:20.922 --> 26:22.547
Twenty-two.
Come on!

26:22.622 --> 26:23.883
- Up!
- Twenty-three.

26:23.956 --> 26:25.319
Down. Up.

26:25.388 --> 26:27.445
- Twenty-four.
- Get that ass down, Cable!

26:27.522 --> 26:28.886
- Up!
- Twenty-five.

26:29.355 --> 26:31.480
That is absolutely horrible.

26:31.555 --> 26:34.453
Pop tall to the lone pine and back! Go!

26:34.522 --> 26:37.885
Move your ass!
Let's move it! Get it going!

26:38.055 --> 26:39.078
Let's go.

26:41.321 --> 26:42.309
Let's go.

26:42.554 --> 26:43.850
Bring them back.

26:43.921 --> 26:46.886
- Circle back!
- Let's go! Get back here!

26:46.954 --> 26:48.284
- Get back in line!
- Let's move!

26:48.354 --> 26:50.115
- Back in formation.
- Let's move, move, move!

26:50.187 --> 26:52.085
Back in formation.

26:53.154 --> 26:55.676
Lean and rest. Senior Chief on deck.

27:29.985 --> 27:31.245
Pop tall.

27:32.518 --> 27:33.541
Oorah!

27:34.184 --> 27:36.013
I don't care who you are,

27:36.284 --> 27:38.216
where you are from
or where you are going.

27:38.284 --> 27:40.216
I care about one thing
and one thing only.

27:40.284 --> 27:43.273
That is the future victims
that you will be asked to save.

27:43.351 --> 27:47.113
If I feel that you will fail them,
I will fail you, understood?

27:47.184 --> 27:49.479
Yes, Senior Chief!

27:51.584 --> 27:54.277
Hodge. Where are you from, Hodge?

27:54.350 --> 27:56.543
I'm from Teaneck, New Jersey,
Senior Chief!

27:56.617 --> 27:58.707
Hodge is our triple repeat.

27:59.549 --> 28:02.015
Do you plan on making it this time,
threepeat?

28:02.083 --> 28:03.343
I really hope to, Senior Chief.

28:03.416 --> 28:05.245
Yeah, well, hope don't float, Hodge.

28:05.316 --> 28:08.339
You better start to learn to swim
against the current and not with it.

28:08.416 --> 28:10.314
Aye, aye, Senior Chief.

28:11.082 --> 28:12.343
Fisch.

28:13.715 --> 28:16.045
Fisch. Why are you here, Fisch?

28:16.615 --> 28:19.513
I'm here to exceed your expectations,
Senior Chief.

28:19.582 --> 28:23.106
I'm a rescue swimmer at heart,
born, bred and water-fed. Oorah!

28:23.982 --> 28:26.641
Wow. I bet you practiced that
all morning.

28:27.782 --> 28:29.872
Mr. Fischer is
our high school swim champ.

28:29.948 --> 28:32.743
He's had scholarships
to every lvy League.

28:33.181 --> 28:36.738
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize that he was so qualified.

28:36.948 --> 28:39.413
I mean, you set records in a pool?

28:40.247 --> 28:41.304
That's amazing.

28:41.380 --> 28:45.107
I'll bet it was like, what,
eight feet deep in the deep end?

28:46.647 --> 28:48.839
What if your nose plug didn't work?

28:48.913 --> 28:52.004
What if another swimmer
had cut into your lane?

28:55.413 --> 28:58.538
For the love of God,
you could have been killed.

28:59.880 --> 29:02.811
Your schedule says that you will
perform a PT test this morning.

29:02.879 --> 29:04.742
That will not be necessary.

29:04.812 --> 29:07.472
Water is where
you've been called to serve.

29:07.545 --> 29:09.408
Water is where you will be tested.

29:14.579 --> 29:17.306
This will serve
in place of your PT in-test.

29:17.378 --> 29:19.935
This is a golno-go exercise.

29:21.312 --> 29:23.777
You will tread water for one hour.

29:24.078 --> 29:28.407
You touch the wall, you fail.
You touch the bottom, you fail.

29:28.477 --> 29:30.500
You fail and you go home.

29:31.411 --> 29:34.571
Senior, this school operates
on a two-challenge rule.

29:34.644 --> 29:36.667
You can't throw them out
on their first day.

29:36.744 --> 29:38.766
If you cannot survive
in a warm pool of water,

29:38.844 --> 29:42.208
then you have no business being here.
Does this class understand?

29:42.277 --> 29:43.572
Yes, Senior Chief!

29:43.643 --> 29:45.632
Oorah, Class 5506.

29:45.710 --> 29:48.403
Now, who here can tell me
the rescue swimmer's motto?

29:48.476 --> 29:50.305
"So others may live," Senior Chief!

29:50.376 --> 29:52.864
Oh, I feel safer already.

29:52.943 --> 29:56.034
You willing to sacrifice your life
so others may live, Goldfish?

29:56.109 --> 29:57.972
Yes, I am, Senior Chief.

29:58.043 --> 30:02.566
You will have to earn that right.
I want all of you to think about that.

30:03.976 --> 30:06.134
There's going to come a time

30:06.809 --> 30:10.605
when you reach the point of exhaustion
and you wanna give up.

30:11.075 --> 30:14.064
Question is, will you?

30:24.974 --> 30:27.963
There are three letters
that will set you free.

30:28.041 --> 30:31.474
DOR. Drop on Request.

30:49.307 --> 30:50.295
Look at that.

30:52.040 --> 30:53.562
Waste of time.

31:01.372 --> 31:03.997
- You all right?
- Hey. Come on, stay up.

31:13.238 --> 31:14.670
Somebody help him out.

31:16.438 --> 31:18.404
Hey, he's going under, man!

31:19.505 --> 31:20.834
Help him out.

31:21.505 --> 31:22.970
Come on!

31:27.205 --> 31:29.193
- Help him out.
- Help him out!

31:40.469 --> 31:42.163
Guys, relax, man!

31:42.870 --> 31:44.166
Come on.

31:46.236 --> 31:47.725
Come on, man.

31:48.136 --> 31:49.762
You're dismissed.

31:50.536 --> 31:53.058
- I cramped up.
- You're gone.

31:54.436 --> 31:56.061
Let's go, Lyons,
out of the water. Hurry up.

31:56.136 --> 31:58.159
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

31:59.936 --> 32:01.424
On your feet.

32:02.368 --> 32:07.198
muscle does not float.

32:09.235 --> 32:11.666
Petty Officer Watson,
pull them out of the pool.

32:11.734 --> 32:12.893
Aye, aye, Senior Chief.

32:12.968 --> 32:14.195
Let's go, people, out of the water.

32:15.434 --> 32:16.661
Hurry up! Let's move, people!

32:16.734 --> 32:18.962
Hurry up! Hurry up!

32:19.035 --> 32:21.001
Class leader, right here.

32:25.867 --> 32:29.459
I thought you said you were willing
to sacrifice your life for another.

32:30.367 --> 32:32.026
I am, Senior Chief.

32:32.100 --> 32:33.656
Then why didn't you
save your teammate

32:33.733 --> 32:35.858
when he reached out for you?

32:38.266 --> 32:41.721
I wasn't aware we were working
as a team, Senior Chief.

32:42.300 --> 32:44.993
That's the only way we work,
swim champ.

32:48.532 --> 32:50.464
Aye, aye, Senior Chief.

33:02.566 --> 33:03.895
Asshole.

33:03.965 --> 33:06.090
- Come again?
- You heard me.

33:06.165 --> 33:08.528
Hey, hey, hey! Ease up! Ease up!

33:09.464 --> 33:10.987
- It's not worth it.
- Come on.

33:11.065 --> 33:13.587
Good news, Lyons. I think there's
an opening on my buoy tender.

33:13.665 --> 33:15.960
I'll put in a word for you, huh?

33:18.498 --> 33:20.793
I'm really gonna miss that guy.

33:26.530 --> 33:29.826
- Hey, man, what are you doing?
- Got your bunk back.

33:36.397 --> 33:38.555
- Captain.
- Ben. Come in.

33:39.297 --> 33:40.694
You work fast.

33:40.763 --> 33:43.490
Lyons,
he was one of our top candidates.

33:44.396 --> 33:46.794
Sometimes you gotta shoot a hostage.

33:46.863 --> 33:50.260
Look, we all know
that you're a legend and all,

33:51.296 --> 33:53.887
but our program
has been proven to work.

33:53.962 --> 33:57.087
There's a gap between training and
what really happens out there, Cujo.

33:57.162 --> 33:58.559
- Oh, really?
- That's right.

33:58.628 --> 34:00.060
My intention is to narrow that gap.

34:00.129 --> 34:03.117
Now, if someone has a problem
with that idea,

34:03.795 --> 34:05.818
I'd like to hear about it.

34:10.295 --> 34:12.590
Is this how it's gonna be, sir?

34:15.427 --> 34:16.791
Yes, it is.

34:18.128 --> 34:21.321
- Permission to be dismissed, sir?
- Granted.

34:27.860 --> 34:30.849
Let's go. Let's go.
Keep it together. Look tight!

34:30.927 --> 34:32.790
Keep it together. Let's go. Let's move.

34:32.860 --> 34:36.485
You've got three minutes
to get this gear on. All of it.

34:36.860 --> 34:38.155
Set! Go!

34:41.726 --> 34:42.713
Let's go.

34:47.159 --> 34:48.748
Are you ready?

34:54.058 --> 34:55.853
Come on, rescue swimmer!

34:58.258 --> 34:59.622
Don't quit on me.

35:15.157 --> 35:16.986
Do you hear me?

35:17.057 --> 35:18.455
Do you hear me?

35:18.723 --> 35:22.281
Pop tall! Pop tall! Pop tall!

35:25.057 --> 35:29.785
If you make a mistake, just fess up to it.
Take your licks and we'll press on.

35:30.056 --> 35:33.545
Everybody now is gonna pay
for your potty mouth.

35:33.623 --> 35:36.713
- Down. Up.
- One!

35:36.789 --> 35:37.948
Down.

35:38.023 --> 35:39.284
- Up.
- Three!

35:39.355 --> 35:40.753
Down. Up.

35:40.823 --> 35:42.516
Five! Six!

35:42.589 --> 35:44.179
- Forward.
- Seven!

35:48.155 --> 35:49.416
Are you crazy?

35:49.622 --> 35:51.315
I'm the commander! Get up!

35:51.389 --> 35:53.854
- Oorah!
- Get down! Get down!

35:54.755 --> 35:55.778
Oorah!

36:03.354 --> 36:04.342
Go.

36:18.687 --> 36:19.675
Oorah.

36:21.420 --> 36:22.408
Oorah.

36:22.820 --> 36:23.808
Oorah!

36:43.052 --> 36:45.517
Can you die from chlorine poisoning?

36:45.819 --> 36:48.341
I can't feel my legs. I'm serious.

36:49.385 --> 36:51.783
I don't know about you guys,
but I feel good.

36:51.852 --> 36:54.908
This Randall guy, he's operating
on some whole other cylinder.

36:54.984 --> 36:57.973
What is it, two weeks, and he's failed
almost half the class already?

36:58.051 --> 36:59.449
He's a legend.

36:59.518 --> 37:01.347
They say he's got
something like 200 saves.

37:01.418 --> 37:03.179
I heard it was 300.

37:03.251 --> 37:05.240
Who cares what his number is?

37:05.317 --> 37:07.783
If he's such a stud,
what's he doing here?

37:07.851 --> 37:09.476
How we feeling, boys?

37:10.083 --> 37:11.481
Hey, Z, where you going?

37:11.551 --> 37:14.415
My sister's best friend
is getting married,

37:14.484 --> 37:16.347
and they're having
a big reception downtown.

37:16.417 --> 37:18.280
I promised her I'd go.

37:18.950 --> 37:21.178
Wait, you said wedding reception?

37:39.982 --> 37:41.675
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

37:41.749 --> 37:42.737
Hi.

37:43.016 --> 37:44.845
- Congratulations.
- Hi.

37:44.915 --> 37:45.903
Nice to meet you.

37:46.315 --> 37:50.747
Yes, Kodiak, Alaska.
The number for Helen Randall.

37:54.548 --> 37:56.980
Okay, try Helen Freeman.

37:59.848 --> 38:01.245
You betcha.

38:07.381 --> 38:09.846
<i>Hi, you've reached</i>
<i>Helen. Leave a message.</i>

38:10.747 --> 38:13.406
<i>Helen, it's Ben.</i>
<i>Jesus, that was weird.</i>

38:13.980 --> 38:17.434
<i>Haven't had to use your maiden name</i>
<i>since we were kids.</i>

38:17.979 --> 38:21.434
Helen, if you're there, just pick up.
We need to talk.

38:25.146 --> 38:26.134
<i>Please.</i>

38:38.546 --> 38:40.341
All right. All right.

38:40.978 --> 38:44.376
To those who have fallen,
to those who have survived Phase 1.

38:44.444 --> 38:46.240
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

38:46.311 --> 38:49.539
- Oorah, oorah, oorah.
- Guys, this is great.

38:49.611 --> 38:54.236
And to our gal Lindsey.
You can rescue me anytime.

38:54.777 --> 38:56.641
- Did he just say that?
- You did not just say that.

38:56.710 --> 38:58.438
- Did he just say that?
- You did not just say that.

38:58.511 --> 39:02.442
You know what, Doran?
You, I think I might actually let drown.

39:03.011 --> 39:04.738
Oh!

39:13.943 --> 39:15.704
Hey, Senior Chief.

39:17.177 --> 39:19.234
Ben, she's hot tonight.

39:25.942 --> 39:27.931
This place has not changed.

39:32.276 --> 39:34.833
- <i>From Kodiak, Alaska...</i>
- Don't.

39:34.909 --> 39:38.534
<i>... Senior Chief Ben Randall</i>
<i>is in the house,</i>

39:38.608 --> 39:40.972
<i>big as day and still alive.</i>

39:41.041 --> 39:43.269
<i>I must owe somebody money.</i>

39:44.874 --> 39:47.306
- You're terrible.
- Oh, Ben.

39:48.941 --> 39:52.066
I heard a rumor you were gonna be
teaching here in town.

39:52.141 --> 39:55.402
If that ain't the karmic wheel spinning,
I don't know what is.

39:56.207 --> 40:00.139
Well. To the prodigal's return.

40:01.007 --> 40:04.803
- Where's your better half?
- She decided to stay home.

40:05.541 --> 40:07.699
- Oh.
- Work stuff.

40:08.573 --> 40:13.029
Yeah. Winter in Kodiak.
Let me see. Winter in Louisiana.

40:13.107 --> 40:15.595
- All right, stop. Stop.
- "She decided to stay home."

40:16.773 --> 40:19.863
Well, it's a good thing
we got a full bottle and half the night.

40:19.939 --> 40:21.337
Yes, we do.

40:24.072 --> 40:26.833
Check it out. She's staring at you.

40:27.572 --> 40:29.231
That girl right there
is not staring at me.

40:29.305 --> 40:31.100
Did you just point at her?

40:31.172 --> 40:33.297
- Did she see you point?
- I don't know.

40:34.672 --> 40:37.399
All right, now you gotta go talk to her.
You gotta go make a move.

40:37.472 --> 40:39.438
- Yeah.
- I can't.

40:39.505 --> 40:42.436
I just don't feel comfortable right now
talking to women.

40:42.504 --> 40:44.436
You're telling me
you wanna jump out of helicopters

40:44.504 --> 40:45.834
- for a living...
- You're talking to me.

40:45.905 --> 40:47.234
...but you can't go talk to a girl?

40:47.304 --> 40:49.963
- That's exactly what I was telling you.
- You're smooth.

40:50.037 --> 40:51.900
All right, look,
I'm gonna help you out here.

40:51.970 --> 40:53.902
I'll show you how it's done.

40:54.271 --> 40:57.600
Pick out the hottest girl in here.
I'll take her home.

40:57.670 --> 40:59.193
- Oh, gosh.
- Okay.

40:59.271 --> 41:02.725
- Here he go, now.
- No, how about I will find the girl?

41:02.837 --> 41:03.962
All right.

41:05.004 --> 41:06.936
- Okey-doke.
- Who you thinking?

41:07.003 --> 41:08.765
Make sure she's hot.

41:09.803 --> 41:11.860
- Where you looking?
- Okay.

41:11.936 --> 41:14.368
At the bar. Two o'clock.

41:18.036 --> 41:20.524
- Yes.
- That's a good one.

41:20.869 --> 41:22.459
There's no way in hell
she's talking to you.

41:22.536 --> 41:24.263
- That one?
- Yeah, that one.

41:24.435 --> 41:26.992
Hundred bucks says
she shuts you down

41:27.068 --> 41:28.534
in less than a minute.

41:29.402 --> 41:30.459
Boom.

41:30.536 --> 41:33.501
- That looks like a bet to me, Jake.
- That's a bet.

41:36.501 --> 41:38.899
All right. All right.

41:38.968 --> 41:42.127
Hundred bucks says I close
in less than a minute.

41:42.201 --> 41:43.758
Oh, absolutely.

41:46.967 --> 41:50.024
- Hats off, man.
- Tick-tock. Tick-tock. Tick-tock.

41:50.101 --> 41:52.090
Clock starts when I talk to her.

41:52.168 --> 41:53.191
That's fine.

41:53.267 --> 41:54.255
This is
gonna be embarrassing.

41:54.333 --> 41:55.356
All right, buddy.

41:55.433 --> 41:56.694
What do you think?
What do you got?

41:56.767 --> 41:58.824
- You think he's gonna do it?
- Yeah.

42:03.400 --> 42:05.991
Evening, ma'am.
Can I buy you a drink?

42:09.233 --> 42:10.994
I don't think so.

42:12.533 --> 42:15.021
You don't know what you're missing.

42:18.999 --> 42:21.227
You sure you wanna go with that one?

42:21.299 --> 42:23.890
That's, like, your top-of-the-line,
A-game material?

42:26.832 --> 42:29.923
See, the way I see it,
you got two choices here:

42:31.231 --> 42:32.458
walk away from me,

42:32.532 --> 42:34.997
or walk out of here with me
and split the cash.

42:36.798 --> 42:37.786
Cash?

42:39.664 --> 42:41.028
What cash?

42:41.098 --> 42:44.427
The money you bet your friends
you could pick me up.

42:46.931 --> 42:48.726
See, that makes me nervous.

42:48.798 --> 42:50.354
She's shutting him down.

42:52.797 --> 42:54.990
How much time you got left?

42:56.997 --> 42:59.690
- About 20 seconds.
- Shall we?

43:02.596 --> 43:04.061
- Oh, my gosh.
- No way.

43:04.129 --> 43:06.595
It looks like they're leaving
the bar together, is what I see.

43:06.663 --> 43:08.288
No way!

43:08.363 --> 43:09.851
You have got to be kidding me.

43:09.929 --> 43:11.418
- Unbelievable.
- How did he do that?

43:11.496 --> 43:13.518
- I'm impressed.
- I'm impressed.

43:14.129 --> 43:17.288
There's a bar outside your base
called Maggie's. You know it?

43:17.362 --> 43:18.419
Yeah.

43:18.495 --> 43:21.689
Good. Meet me there next Friday
around 8:00?

43:21.762 --> 43:23.853
- You got a name?
- Yeah.

43:24.495 --> 43:26.358
Don't forget my money.

43:31.461 --> 43:33.324
You got a middle name?

43:36.028 --> 43:38.721
You do realize I can't go back in there.

43:42.628 --> 43:44.287
<i>This is the sound of death knocking.</i>

43:44.361 --> 43:47.122
<i>SAR alarms and sleep deprivation</i>
<i>are part...</i>

43:49.161 --> 43:51.127
Where the hell are they?

44:03.260 --> 44:07.192
You know, the first stages
of hypothermia are the most critical.

44:07.260 --> 44:08.247
Why?

44:09.192 --> 44:12.215
Because you still have
the ability to think. Say it.

44:12.292 --> 44:15.452
You still have
the ability to think.

44:15.526 --> 44:18.321
The decisions you make
during this stage

44:18.392 --> 44:22.222
are gonna determine
whether you live or die.

44:22.424 --> 44:24.686
There a reason
you're not breathing, Goldfish?

44:25.491 --> 44:27.252
Is there a reason
why you're not breathing?

44:28.725 --> 44:31.213
I don't know anyone
who can stay alive without breathing

44:31.291 --> 44:33.086
for 15 minutes, Senior Chief.

44:33.158 --> 44:34.817
Are you a coroner?

44:35.857 --> 44:39.153
Because pronouncing people dead
is not part of our job description.

44:39.224 --> 44:40.712
What do we always say?

44:40.791 --> 44:43.256
There's dead
and then there's dead.

44:44.423 --> 44:47.980
We never stop, Jake,
not from the cabin to the tarmac.

44:48.056 --> 44:50.079
- We never stop.
- Aye, aye, Senior Chief.

44:50.157 --> 44:52.816
- Understood?
- Yes, Senior Chief.

44:52.890 --> 44:55.685
Okay, Jake, in the pool.
Hodge, you're up.

44:55.890 --> 44:57.220
You're with the dummy.

44:59.256 --> 45:01.449
All right, now. Three letters.

45:01.956 --> 45:05.285
Three letters will get you people
a cup of hot coffee and a blanket.

45:07.222 --> 45:09.211
What do you say, Goldfish?

45:09.889 --> 45:12.514
I'm actually not that cold anymore,
Senior Chief.

45:12.588 --> 45:16.077
You're not cold anymore
because blood is moving

45:16.156 --> 45:18.417
from your outer extremities
to your heart.

45:18.488 --> 45:20.818
That's why your arms won't work.

45:21.355 --> 45:25.014
You can plan on spending
roughly 60% of your career

45:25.088 --> 45:27.020
in a mildly hypothermic state.

45:27.355 --> 45:29.684
Senior Chief, may I have a word?

45:43.887 --> 45:44.875
Sir?

45:46.387 --> 45:49.375
Why wasn't I informed of this?
You know, we have classrooms.

45:49.453 --> 45:53.249
Your assignment is to simply teach
the stages of hypothermia.

45:53.386 --> 45:58.875
Sir, in about two and a half minutes,
they'll understand.

46:02.619 --> 46:04.744
Permission to carry on, sir?

46:06.819 --> 46:07.807
Go ahead.

46:20.985 --> 46:25.815
Three letters, people, will get you
a hot cup of coffee and a warm blanket.

46:26.885 --> 46:29.680
What do you say, Class 5506?

46:30.317 --> 46:31.907
Oorah.

46:40.583 --> 46:43.777
<i>This is an oxygen-deprivation</i>
<i>anaerobic exercise.</i>

46:44.517 --> 46:46.880
<i>You and your partner</i>
<i>will push your brick</i>

46:46.949 --> 46:50.404
<i>along the bottom of the pool,</i>
<i>down and back.</i>

46:51.816 --> 46:55.078
<i>If you need air, you may surface.</i>
<i>One breath.</i>

46:56.216 --> 46:59.579
<i>Your partner must remain underwater</i>
<i>until you return.</i>

47:00.949 --> 47:04.971
<i>Your brick can only move</i>
<i>while both of you are touching it.</i>

47:06.382 --> 47:09.814
<i>If you both surface, you both fail.</i>

47:10.948 --> 47:14.210
<i>This exercise is designed</i>
<i>to teach you teamwork.</i>

47:15.015 --> 47:18.879
<i>On my whistle, drop your gear,</i>
<i>enter the pool and pair up.</i>

47:50.112 --> 47:52.738
I said one breath, Sunkist. Let's go!

47:53.513 --> 47:54.604
- I can't.
- Come on!

47:54.679 --> 47:55.871
- I can't.
- "I can't."

47:55.945 --> 47:58.604
Get your ass out of the pool! Let's go!

48:00.612 --> 48:02.669
Come on! Lean and rest.

48:02.745 --> 48:05.734
You wanna quit, just quit now.
I could use those new shoes.

48:05.812 --> 48:08.073
Senior Chief, we got a problem.

48:08.979 --> 48:10.944
Somebody's missing.

48:16.378 --> 48:17.843
Jesus Christ.

48:27.744 --> 48:30.369
That's gotta be a new record. Oorah.

48:31.777 --> 48:34.641
I'm so sick of records. Go get him.

48:54.009 --> 48:58.134
You think I'm impressed because
you can hold your breath, Goldfish?

49:00.142 --> 49:04.040
I wouldn't venture to say
what would impress you, Senior Chief.

49:10.242 --> 49:12.799
All right. Get him out of the pool.
We're done for the day.

49:12.875 --> 49:15.534
Out of the pool, Fischer. Let's move.

49:19.907 --> 49:21.930
- Oorah!
- Move your ass.

49:24.307 --> 49:25.432
Pop tall, Sunkist.

49:25.507 --> 49:27.098
Out of the pool.
Out of the pool.

49:34.607 --> 49:35.595
Records.

49:38.140 --> 49:40.628
Never stare
directly into the flame, people.

49:40.706 --> 49:42.638
It will impair your night vision.

49:42.706 --> 49:46.536
This is a Mark 58 flare.
This is what it looks like.

49:47.106 --> 49:49.435
It'll light up a 50-foot swath of water

49:49.506 --> 49:52.370
and can be detected by infrared
miles out.

49:54.339 --> 49:56.066
This is a demonstration model.

49:56.139 --> 49:58.798
The normal one will burn
for 40 to 60 minutes.

49:58.872 --> 50:00.531
Hey, pay attention.

50:00.605 --> 50:05.435
The Mark 58 is used to reference
the wind, to detect a current.

50:05.505 --> 50:08.096
Petty Officer Watson is gonna talk
a little bit more about that.

50:10.238 --> 50:11.828
<i>Five minutes.</i>

50:18.304 --> 50:20.326
The vessel you're looking
at right now,

50:20.403 --> 50:21.994
people, is listing to the port side.

50:22.071 --> 50:24.662
As a rescue swimmer, when you get
to the door of the helicopter,

50:24.737 --> 50:26.498
you need to look down
and pay attention

50:26.570 --> 50:28.933
to what you really have down there.

50:29.003 --> 50:32.526
It's very important
that you understand your limitations.

50:32.603 --> 50:36.229
Limitations without understanding
are gonna get you killed.

50:36.302 --> 50:40.530
Case in point, this vessel's trapped
in pancake ice in the Bering Sea.

50:40.870 --> 50:42.768
And as you can see,
the crew are out on the deck

50:42.836 --> 50:45.563
in a relatively manageable
hoisting position.

50:45.636 --> 50:47.226
But suddenly...

50:49.069 --> 50:52.126
Those pieces of ice can weigh in
upwards of thousands of pounds.

50:52.202 --> 50:56.930
Now imagine yourself trapped
in between 2,000-pound pieces of ice

50:57.002 --> 50:58.627
trying to free-swim.

50:58.702 --> 50:59.793
Thank you, Chief.

50:59.869 --> 51:02.426
Next scenario, Petty Officer Watson.

51:03.001 --> 51:05.490
Before you leave
that helicopter, going down to a...

51:05.567 --> 51:10.465
Standardization is one of the reasons
we were so successful during Katrina.

51:10.534 --> 51:13.432
We had crews come in
from all over the country,

51:13.501 --> 51:16.933
but it didn't matter, because we have
all been trained the same way.

51:17.000 --> 51:19.727
I didn't know my pilot,
I didn't know my copilot,

51:19.800 --> 51:21.823
I didn't know my flight mechanic.
But guess what?

51:21.900 --> 51:23.298
It didn't matter, because...

51:23.367 --> 51:24.491
That's why we do it.

51:24.566 --> 51:27.055
So you have to get your mind
wrapped around that idea.

51:27.134 --> 51:30.930
When that helicopter starts going,
when the wind starts coming...

51:31.000 --> 51:32.829
Twenty!
Down! Up!

51:32.900 --> 51:34.661
- Twenty-one!
- Down! Up!

51:34.733 --> 51:36.631
- Twenty-two!
- Down! Up!

51:36.699 --> 51:38.688
<i>Twenty-three!</i>

51:38.766 --> 51:40.255
- Two!
- Down!

51:40.333 --> 51:41.889
- Up!
- Three!

51:43.066 --> 51:45.157
<i>Don't need no land</i>
<i>Don't need no tree</i>

51:45.265 --> 51:47.697
<i>Out in the water</i>
<i>That's where I wanna be</i>

52:00.965 --> 52:03.829
- Hey, Mags, can I have a beer?
- Sure.

52:05.698 --> 52:07.721
Well, well.

52:07.997 --> 52:10.589
So you are gonna
have a drink with me.

52:10.664 --> 52:14.426
No, I'm having a drink near you.
Entirely different thing.

52:16.630 --> 52:19.494
You're a regular lightning rod,
aren't you?

52:20.097 --> 52:23.756
- What's your name?
- Daisy Buchanan.

52:25.296 --> 52:27.159
You're lying, Daisy Buchanan.

52:28.063 --> 52:30.585
- There is that possibility.
- No.

52:30.662 --> 52:32.651
That was a sure-fire lie.

52:32.729 --> 52:35.559
So I take it
you've read <i>The Great Gatsby.</i>

52:37.462 --> 52:40.916
- Where's my money?
- It's not on me.

52:41.662 --> 52:44.786
But it is close. In a very safe place.

52:45.162 --> 52:49.753
Now, I've drawn a map
with a complex set of clues.

52:50.461 --> 52:53.621
Each one is more fiendishly clever
than the last.

52:58.595 --> 53:00.151
That works, too.

53:01.528 --> 53:03.891
This is just a picture of your pants.

53:03.961 --> 53:08.484
Yeah, but it's a bad picture, which is
what makes it so fiendishly clever.

53:08.827 --> 53:09.815
Nice.

53:09.894 --> 53:12.257
How did Emily Thomas
become a schoolteacher?

53:12.327 --> 53:14.225
Well, how does Jake Fischer
become a guy

53:14.293 --> 53:16.759
who wants to jump out of helicopters?

53:18.026 --> 53:21.322
I killed a couple guys
and had to get out of Dodge.

53:23.026 --> 53:26.117
- You're lying.
- There is that possibility.

53:28.559 --> 53:29.684
The truth.

53:30.659 --> 53:33.250
My bull-riding career
was going down the drain.

53:33.326 --> 53:37.088
- Okay, that's better.
- All right, now you.

53:41.226 --> 53:43.021
I really should go.

53:43.092 --> 53:45.319
Go? What? No, you're not going.

53:45.391 --> 53:47.823
We're just starting to have fun.
You're insulting my drawing.

53:47.892 --> 53:49.790
No, you were insulting your drawing.

53:49.858 --> 53:51.790
Although, to be fair,
it's a pretty lame drawing.

53:51.858 --> 53:54.347
All right. Well, you can't go,
'cause you owe me a dance.

53:54.425 --> 53:55.583
No, I don't think so.

53:55.657 --> 53:57.452
Well, then, I'm gonna
have to take that money back,

53:57.524 --> 53:59.218
'cause I wouldn't feel right
taking the money...

53:59.290 --> 54:01.483
Look, every 18 weeks,
a new bunch of you guys comes in,

54:01.557 --> 54:03.682
all looking to score with the local talent.

54:03.758 --> 54:05.849
I live here. I work here.

54:07.491 --> 54:10.786
It's a good thing
I'm just asking for a dance, then.

54:12.990 --> 54:14.615
Okay, one dance.

54:16.389 --> 54:19.514
No attachments. Just casual.

54:20.089 --> 54:22.851
I'm a guy. I can do casual.

54:23.156 --> 54:24.349
Mmm-hmm.

54:24.423 --> 54:26.718
I am the king of casual.

54:29.089 --> 54:30.748
There's just one thing, though.

54:31.789 --> 54:34.448
You're gonna have to stop
undressing me with your eyes,

54:34.522 --> 54:37.317
'cause there's no way
you're getting me into bed.

55:20.153 --> 55:21.413
Hey, you.

55:24.220 --> 55:26.049
I gotta get to work.

55:27.219 --> 55:29.912
- I'm late. I fell asleep.
- What...

55:29.985 --> 55:31.713
- They're gonna kill me.
- They won't kill you.

55:31.786 --> 55:32.808
This isn't like school.

55:32.885 --> 55:35.215
They don't hand out tardies
in the military.

55:37.052 --> 55:39.847
- You smell really good.
- I smell like you.

55:46.184 --> 55:48.343
- He never came back?
- Nope.

55:49.284 --> 55:50.715
Wow.

55:50.784 --> 55:54.444
Four years as lead instructor,
I never had one go missing.

55:55.784 --> 55:58.443
All right, take the others to the pool.
I'll catch up.

55:58.517 --> 56:00.176
Aye, aye, Senior.

56:17.382 --> 56:19.780
Oh, God, there they are.
Stop. Stop the car. Stop.

56:19.850 --> 56:20.838
- Here?
- Yes.

56:20.915 --> 56:21.938
- Okay.
- I'll call you.

56:22.015 --> 56:23.106
You better. Bye.

56:25.516 --> 56:27.004
Jake! Jake! Jake!

56:27.116 --> 56:30.139
<i>Airman Fischer's</i>
<i>coming in late, yeah</i>

56:30.216 --> 56:31.204
Here.

56:31.281 --> 56:34.179
<i>Airman Fischer's</i>
<i>coming in late, yeah</i>

56:34.248 --> 56:35.236
Hi.

56:39.081 --> 56:42.138
<i>Must be nice to go out on a date, yeah</i>

56:42.215 --> 56:45.238
<i>Must be nice to go out on a date, yeah</i>

56:45.981 --> 56:48.243
Oh, my goodness, look at this.

56:49.748 --> 56:53.009
Look at this.
"Freshman Leads Team to State Title."

56:54.714 --> 56:56.077
That's you.

56:56.880 --> 56:57.903
Holy smokes.

56:57.980 --> 57:02.208
"At only 16, Jake Fischer displays
the traits of a seasoned athlete.

57:03.013 --> 57:07.502
"One thing's for sure: the future
looks bright for this young competitor."

57:08.813 --> 57:12.677
Guess they didn't know
you were gonna flunk out of "A" School.

57:15.812 --> 57:17.801
You have a nice evening?

57:20.113 --> 57:21.544
Get dressed.

57:41.277 --> 57:44.038
Think we need another brick.
Bring it in.

57:46.711 --> 57:47.971
Goldfish.

57:50.411 --> 57:51.706
Goldfish.

58:01.343 --> 58:04.866
Thanks to Mr. Fischer's
extracurricular activities,

58:04.943 --> 58:08.239
you have all now gone 36 hours
without sleep.

58:09.642 --> 58:10.767
Blow it.

58:15.542 --> 58:18.702
Class leader, you are done.
Form it up in the shallow end.

58:18.776 --> 58:19.934
Aye, Senior Chief!

58:20.008 --> 58:22.701
Class 5506, form it up!

58:23.142 --> 58:27.665
No. No, no, no. You're with me.

58:31.875 --> 58:34.568
<i>I'm a rescue swimmer, yes, I am</i>

58:34.641 --> 58:36.970
<i>I'm here to pull your ass out of this jam</i>

58:37.041 --> 58:39.303
<i>I jump from the helo</i>
<i>and swing from the cable</i>

58:39.374 --> 58:41.363
All right, knock it off.

58:42.274 --> 58:44.899
I am having a hard time
figuring you out, Fischer.

58:45.741 --> 58:49.003
I mean, you like seeing your picture
in the paper.

58:49.373 --> 58:52.271
In it for the glory, maybe a few chicks.
Am I right?

58:52.340 --> 58:53.772
But when it comes down to it,

58:53.840 --> 58:56.670
you will choose yourself over them
every time,

58:56.740 --> 58:59.570
like you did on the first day in the pool,

59:00.040 --> 59:02.835
like you did yesterday
by missing muster.

59:02.906 --> 59:05.337
Won't happen again, Senior Chief!

59:05.740 --> 59:08.934
Why don't you do us both a big favor
and quit?

59:10.072 --> 59:12.731
<i>I'm a rescue swimmer, yes, I am</i>

59:13.506 --> 59:15.994
<i>I'm here to pull your ass out of this jam</i>

59:16.072 --> 59:19.061
<i>I jump from the helo</i>
<i>and swing from the cable</i>

59:19.638 --> 59:22.763
<i>I'm not Tarzan</i>
<i>I'm just willing and able</i>

59:28.171 --> 59:30.728
Give me something else, Senior Chief.

59:31.371 --> 59:32.631
Thirty!

59:33.537 --> 59:34.935
Thirty-one!

59:35.871 --> 59:37.030
Thirty-two!

59:38.004 --> 59:38.992
Thirty-three!

59:40.504 --> 59:41.800
Thirty-four!

59:43.137 --> 59:44.535
Thirty-five!

59:45.170 --> 59:46.534
Thirty-six!

59:46.770 --> 59:48.532
Stop. Drop them.

59:48.603 --> 59:51.035
Senior Chief's on deck. Pop tall.

59:52.536 --> 59:54.002
Oorah!

59:57.070 --> 59:58.228
Morning, class.

59:58.303 --> 59:59.667
Today we were going to learn

59:59.737 --> 01:00:03.635
about how to approach
a drowning victim in high seas,

01:00:05.669 --> 01:00:08.658
but I think there are some here
who aren't interested in that victim.

01:00:08.736 --> 01:00:10.326
Fact, I think there's some in this class

01:00:10.402 --> 01:00:13.368
who aren't interested
in saving lives at all.

01:00:14.368 --> 01:00:16.732
I believe there are some

01:00:16.802 --> 01:00:19.767
who are more interested
in setting records.

01:00:20.135 --> 01:00:22.828
So today is record day.

01:00:36.434 --> 01:00:38.332
5:28.

01:00:38.434 --> 01:00:40.729
Put one on the board for Goldfish.

01:00:45.533 --> 01:00:47.362
Wow, he's fast.

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:51.295
He's good.

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:57.758
You got it, man! You got it, Fisch!

01:00:57.933 --> 01:01:01.296
Another record. Chalk it up, Chief.

01:01:01.365 --> 01:01:03.923
- Get some.
- You are the man!

01:01:03.999 --> 01:01:07.328
You people do not deserve
to be in the same pool as Jake.

01:01:07.399 --> 01:01:09.297
He's destroying you.

01:01:11.832 --> 01:01:14.730
Wow, look at him go! He's fast!

01:01:14.898 --> 01:01:16.523
Wow, he's fast.

01:01:16.598 --> 01:01:19.894
Come on, you're all fighting for second.
Just first loser.

01:01:19.965 --> 01:01:20.988
This is fun.

01:01:21.065 --> 01:01:23.121
We'll pass out trophies later.

01:01:29.064 --> 01:01:30.620
Unbelievable.

01:01:34.331 --> 01:01:35.819
Unbelievable.

01:01:39.130 --> 01:01:41.790
You want me to pull these pansies out?

01:01:48.529 --> 01:01:51.984
- You do not wanna hear about my day.
- Yeah, I do.

01:01:55.097 --> 01:01:57.153
Man, this guy Randall...

01:01:57.229 --> 01:02:01.355
You know, it doesn't matter what I do.
It's just not good enough.

01:02:01.429 --> 01:02:03.860
Well, maybe he's just trying
to push you to be better.

01:02:03.929 --> 01:02:06.327
You know, we teachers do that
to the ones we believe in.

01:02:06.396 --> 01:02:08.657
No, it's personal with me.

01:02:09.295 --> 01:02:11.557
He knows that I'm better than he was.

01:02:11.695 --> 01:02:14.820
I mean, today,
I broke every one of his records.

01:02:14.895 --> 01:02:16.793
I own them all.

01:02:17.161 --> 01:02:18.684
Not all of them.

01:02:18.761 --> 01:02:21.250
There's one record you won't break.

01:02:22.328 --> 01:02:24.021
This is the <i>Aegis.</i>

01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:27.553
Medical ship. Caught on fire.

01:02:28.427 --> 01:02:30.916
It was a nightmare.
People burning in their beds.

01:02:30.993 --> 01:02:33.653
And Ben Randall
got every one of those people off there,

01:02:33.728 --> 01:02:35.159
except for this one guy.

01:02:35.227 --> 01:02:37.591
And right when the ship
started to go down,

01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:39.956
he reaches down and grabs this guy.

01:02:40.227 --> 01:02:43.386
He's hanging from the cable
with this man's life in his hands,

01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:44.926
and the winch jams.

01:02:44.993 --> 01:02:48.516
It's 20 minutes to the base.
The man's screaming.

01:02:48.959 --> 01:02:51.755
Ben looks him dead in the eye,
and you know what he said?

01:02:51.826 --> 01:02:53.554
He said, "I won't let go."

01:02:53.626 --> 01:02:54.886
What happened?

01:02:54.959 --> 01:02:58.084
Dislocated his shoulder,
tore every tendon in his hand.

01:02:58.159 --> 01:02:59.624
But he didn't let go.

01:02:59.692 --> 01:03:02.556
Twenty minutes, just fingertips.

01:03:03.192 --> 01:03:06.386
You break that record
and you give me a call.

01:03:21.124 --> 01:03:22.522
My day was all right.

01:04:34.554 --> 01:04:38.384
So here's my thinking.
We should go on a date.

01:04:39.853 --> 01:04:42.012
- Well, what do you call this?
- No, no, no.

01:04:42.087 --> 01:04:44.279
I'm talking about, like, a real date.

01:04:44.352 --> 01:04:47.841
You know, with, like, a nice restaurant,
some nice clothes.

01:04:47.919 --> 01:04:49.908
I'll get you some flowers.

01:04:49.985 --> 01:04:52.543
I thought we agreed
to keep this casual.

01:04:52.618 --> 01:04:54.811
Look, it's one steak. What is...

01:04:54.885 --> 01:05:00.079
One steak is not gonna forge some
kind of a lasting emotional bond.

01:05:01.385 --> 01:05:02.851
I'm serious.

01:05:03.218 --> 01:05:04.309
Yeah?

01:05:04.385 --> 01:05:06.351
- Yeah.
- So am I.

01:05:06.418 --> 01:05:08.883
It's one dinner. What's it gonna hurt?

01:05:08.951 --> 01:05:12.076
Well, if you ordered a steak,
I'd imagine a cow would be involved.

01:05:12.151 --> 01:05:15.275
What do you have, an art gallery
over here? What is this "2"?

01:05:16.584 --> 01:05:20.243
It's so the guy behind me knows
what place he's coming in.

01:05:21.684 --> 01:05:22.809
What about this one?

01:05:22.883 --> 01:05:29.805
That is the initials of the guys
on my high school relay team.

01:05:30.683 --> 01:05:33.081
A drunken celebration gone wrong?

01:05:34.249 --> 01:05:36.044
Something like that.

01:05:36.650 --> 01:05:39.877
- So, about this date.
- God. It's just dinner, right?

01:05:39.949 --> 01:05:44.938
No flowers, where we will discuss
nothing emotional or important?

01:05:46.349 --> 01:05:48.371
I am fully prepared

01:05:48.849 --> 01:05:53.440
to do an entire hour
on nothing but the Chicago Bears.

01:05:53.916 --> 01:05:56.074
And we can have
completely meaningless sex

01:05:56.148 --> 01:05:58.046
immediately afterwards.

01:05:58.115 --> 01:06:01.513
You think I'm gonna sleep with you
on our first date?

01:06:01.981 --> 01:06:03.446
Think again.

01:06:05.148 --> 01:06:06.875
You just head-butted me.

01:06:07.148 --> 01:06:09.511
I'm gonna teach you the breaststroke.

01:06:09.581 --> 01:06:14.275
It's pretty complicated,
different than that of the butterfly.

01:06:18.214 --> 01:06:21.611
I guess I can't sleep.

01:06:23.914 --> 01:06:25.903
Well, of course you can't.

01:06:27.213 --> 01:06:29.406
Your wife left you.
Your best friend died.

01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:31.469
You sound like a damn country song.

01:06:31.547 --> 01:06:34.240
If you had a dog,
he'd be run over by now.

01:06:34.313 --> 01:06:37.143
- So, did she send you papers?
- Yeah.

01:06:37.479 --> 01:06:38.968
And did you read them?

01:06:40.979 --> 01:06:41.967
No, I did not.

01:06:42.679 --> 01:06:45.201
Well, you think you might ought to?

01:06:51.812 --> 01:06:54.074
You know,
there never was anyone else, Mags.

01:06:54.145 --> 01:06:55.735
Like hell, Ben.

01:06:57.145 --> 01:06:58.838
You're a bigamist.

01:06:59.611 --> 01:07:02.008
You been married to the Coast Guard
all along.

01:07:02.078 --> 01:07:03.976
Give me that shoulder.

01:07:04.478 --> 01:07:09.035
You probably swum it out of socket
trying to prove you're still 19.

01:07:09.677 --> 01:07:11.143
Am I right?

01:07:14.977 --> 01:07:17.169
When the heck did we get old?

01:07:17.243 --> 01:07:19.505
Hell, I've always been old, Ben.

01:07:19.577 --> 01:07:21.406
You know what, though? I don't mind.

01:07:21.477 --> 01:07:24.136
I mean, if my muscles ache,
it's 'cause I've used them.

01:07:24.210 --> 01:07:26.369
If it's hard for me
to walk up them steps now,

01:07:26.444 --> 01:07:31.206
it's 'cause I walked up them every night
to lay next to a man who loved me.

01:07:31.276 --> 01:07:32.765
I got a few wrinkles here and there,

01:07:32.843 --> 01:07:37.537
but I've laid under thousands of skies
on sunny days, yeah.

01:07:38.710 --> 01:07:43.165
I look and feel this way,
well, 'cause I drank and I smoked,

01:07:43.242 --> 01:07:47.004
I lived and I loved,
and danced, sang, sweat

01:07:47.076 --> 01:07:50.564
and screwed my way
through a pretty damned good life,

01:07:50.709 --> 01:07:52.299
if you ask me.

01:07:52.408 --> 01:07:54.465
Getting old ain't bad, Ben.

01:07:54.542 --> 01:07:56.633
Getting old, that's earned.

01:08:30.473 --> 01:08:32.870
There will come a time
when you might have to decide

01:08:32.939 --> 01:08:34.801
who lives and dies out there.

01:08:36.339 --> 01:08:37.736
It's a terrible responsibility,

01:08:37.807 --> 01:08:41.136
but it is one you will have to make
as a rescue swimmer.

01:08:44.305 --> 01:08:45.703
The bigger reality is,

01:08:46.939 --> 01:08:49.497
it's also something
you're going to have to live with

01:08:49.604 --> 01:08:50.935
as a human being.

01:08:54.372 --> 01:08:58.361
There will come a time
when you're going to have to say no.

01:08:59.471 --> 01:09:03.631
The most important person
to keep alive is yourself.

01:09:04.639 --> 01:09:10.593
You'll be facing crews from five to 20,
all saying, "Save me, save me."

01:09:10.671 --> 01:09:12.603
They're looking for a miracle.

01:09:13.770 --> 01:09:16.566
- How old are you, Hodge?
- Twenty-four.

01:09:16.871 --> 01:09:20.234
At 24 years old,
you have to become that miracle.

01:09:20.537 --> 01:09:23.832
You have to find a way
to be that miracle.

01:09:27.737 --> 01:09:30.635
Looking right,
looking center, looking left.

01:09:31.437 --> 01:09:32.663
Oorah!

01:09:39.803 --> 01:09:43.031
You okay, sir? I'm a rescue swimmer.

01:09:53.602 --> 01:09:54.760
Again.

01:10:17.368 --> 01:10:19.299
All right, that's it. Time-out.

01:10:19.367 --> 01:10:22.561
- Panics every time, Senior.
- Hodge, over here.

01:10:26.567 --> 01:10:27.624
Hey.

01:10:32.333 --> 01:10:34.457
The only difference
between you and the victim

01:10:34.533 --> 01:10:37.363
is the attitude
in which you enter the water.

01:10:37.433 --> 01:10:39.365
You've gotta figure out
a way to be calm

01:10:39.433 --> 01:10:42.160
in the face of chaos.
Do you understand?

01:10:45.399 --> 01:10:48.024
That's your first challenge, Charlie.

01:10:48.499 --> 01:10:50.828
One more and you're gone.

01:10:53.565 --> 01:10:56.725
- Come out.
- Aye, aye, Senior Chief.

01:11:01.898 --> 01:11:03.693
What's up, Big Fisch?

01:11:12.230 --> 01:11:14.924
You don't have to take his shit, Hodge.

01:11:15.664 --> 01:11:18.823
What do you know?
It's so easy for you, Fischer.

01:11:19.297 --> 01:11:20.354
Is that right?

01:11:21.763 --> 01:11:22.751
Yeah.

01:11:23.797 --> 01:11:25.286
You know, you don't get it.

01:11:26.596 --> 01:11:29.153
You don't realize
that you're tougher than I am.

01:11:29.229 --> 01:11:30.388
And how's that?

01:11:30.463 --> 01:11:33.361
Well, if I get kicked out of here,
I'm not coming back.

01:11:33.430 --> 01:11:35.759
I'm definitely not coming back twice.

01:11:35.829 --> 01:11:37.591
I mean, you got guts, man.

01:11:37.662 --> 01:11:38.992
Stupidity.

01:11:39.829 --> 01:11:41.954
How long you been here, man?

01:11:43.696 --> 01:11:46.628
Altogether... I don't know,
10 weeks the first time,

01:11:46.696 --> 01:11:50.594
- six weeks, two days the second time...
- Six weeks this time.

01:11:50.662 --> 01:11:51.820
So basically, you've been here

01:11:51.895 --> 01:11:54.225
longer than anybody
that's graduated this place,

01:11:54.295 --> 01:11:56.158
but you don't think you can make it.

01:11:59.028 --> 01:12:01.153
Lighten up on yourself, man.

01:12:01.828 --> 01:12:03.350
Let's go. Let's get a beer.

01:12:04.327 --> 01:12:07.725
Hey, wait. Don't you have a date
with the girl from the wedding?

01:12:08.127 --> 01:12:12.582
Yeah, but it's not till 9:00.
We got time. Get dressed.

01:12:15.361 --> 01:12:16.656
Let's go.

01:12:17.794 --> 01:12:20.124
When you go under,
when you're pulling on your stroke,

01:12:20.193 --> 01:12:22.819
- move your hand...
- Wait a minute. Where are we going?

01:12:24.493 --> 01:12:27.822
Jake, that's a squid bar.
I mean, there's Navy guys everywhere.

01:12:27.893 --> 01:12:29.416
I don't give a shit. A beer's a beer.

01:12:29.493 --> 01:12:32.788
When you're pulling through the water,
you're gonna pull yourself through.

01:12:33.492 --> 01:12:34.890
- Like, you know...
- So I'll go fast.

01:12:34.959 --> 01:12:37.390
No, you wanna lay to your side
and pull it like that.

01:12:42.392 --> 01:12:44.585
Hey, Charlie,
you get those fittings replaced

01:12:44.659 --> 01:12:47.056
- before you came off to get tanked up?
- Yes, sir, Captain.

01:12:47.125 --> 01:12:49.488
Yeah, I'll believe that when I see it.

01:12:49.558 --> 01:12:50.717
We go to "A" School,

01:12:50.792 --> 01:12:53.383
which is the most difficult school
in the military.

01:12:53.458 --> 01:12:56.253
The attrition rate's, like...
What is it, 50%?

01:12:56.324 --> 01:12:57.312
50%.

01:12:57.391 --> 01:12:59.118
- It's over 50%.
- Over 50.

01:12:59.191 --> 01:13:01.816
We're still here,
'cause we're the best of the best.

01:13:02.624 --> 01:13:06.579
When storms shut down entire ports,
you know who goes out?

01:13:07.124 --> 01:13:08.419
We do.

01:13:08.490 --> 01:13:11.082
When hurricanes...
When hurricanes ground the US Navy,

01:13:11.157 --> 01:13:14.783
like these little guys over here,
guess who goes out?

01:13:14.857 --> 01:13:16.379
That's right, we do.

01:13:16.457 --> 01:13:19.150
Look, honey,
you better keep it down in here, okay?

01:13:19.223 --> 01:13:21.155
Okay, honey. She called me "honey."

01:13:22.723 --> 01:13:23.916
Okay, honey.

01:13:23.990 --> 01:13:26.979
But when God himself reaches down
from heaven...

01:13:27.690 --> 01:13:30.554
- What does he do, Jake, when he...
- Rips houses off the foundation.

01:13:30.623 --> 01:13:33.986
When God himself rips houses
off the foundation, we go out,

01:13:34.056 --> 01:13:35.749
because we are rescue swimmers,

01:13:35.822 --> 01:13:38.414
and that is our job,
and that's what we do.

01:13:38.489 --> 01:13:40.613
You might wanna
recheck your compass.

01:13:40.689 --> 01:13:43.087
This ain't no puddle pirate bar.

01:13:51.754 --> 01:13:54.584
No problem,
because we were just leaving anyway.

01:13:54.654 --> 01:13:56.314
- Sit down, Hodge.
- Jake.

01:13:56.388 --> 01:13:58.081
- Finish your beer.
- Jake.

01:13:58.155 --> 01:13:59.780
Yeah, sit, Hodge.

01:14:00.454 --> 01:14:02.215
That's my beer, man.

01:14:07.220 --> 01:14:08.686
Finished now?

01:14:10.421 --> 01:14:12.284
Must be happy hour.

01:14:17.286 --> 01:14:18.274
Hey!

01:14:19.787 --> 01:14:20.810
Back off.

01:14:23.386 --> 01:14:25.874
Everyone in this place is retired Navy.

01:14:25.952 --> 01:14:28.679
Hey. Hey, when do I get
that phone call?

01:14:29.319 --> 01:14:32.773
I know I get a phone call.
When do I get my phone call?

01:14:38.052 --> 01:14:39.575
Ma'am, I am sorry,

01:14:39.652 --> 01:14:42.277
but if nobody come in 20 minutes,
I need the table.

01:14:42.652 --> 01:14:43.708
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

01:14:43.785 --> 01:14:44.876
Yeah.

01:14:49.252 --> 01:14:51.184
She's never gonna talk to me again.

01:14:52.118 --> 01:14:54.515
You know they're gonna
kick us out for this, right?

01:14:54.584 --> 01:14:55.743
Yep.

01:14:59.950 --> 01:15:02.178
Least they can't say we quit.

01:15:03.251 --> 01:15:07.512
I was never gonna make it, anyway.
Skinner's right. Panic every time.

01:15:08.884 --> 01:15:10.713
Man, screw Skinner.

01:15:12.150 --> 01:15:13.979
I'm Skinner. Break my hold.

01:15:14.050 --> 01:15:16.539
Hey, what are you doing, man?
Come on, Fischer, get off me.

01:15:16.617 --> 01:15:17.877
Clock's ticking. Break it.

01:15:17.949 --> 01:15:21.177
Fischer, you're hurting me, man.
Fischer, get off me, man!

01:15:22.183 --> 01:15:24.842
Come on, Fischer, you're hurting me.
Fischer, man, get off!

01:15:24.916 --> 01:15:26.939
- Break the goddamn hold.
- Fischer, get off me, man!

01:15:27.016 --> 01:15:29.607
- Break the goddamn hold, Hodge.
- Fischer, get off me!

01:15:31.115 --> 01:15:32.774
I said, get off me!

01:15:33.249 --> 01:15:34.442
All right.

01:15:34.715 --> 01:15:37.909
Now, it's just like that
when you're in the water.

01:15:40.882 --> 01:15:43.939
Well, now. We could come back.

01:15:44.415 --> 01:15:47.779
Give you boys time for a smoke
and some pillow talk.

01:15:55.814 --> 01:15:57.075
You can't kick us out.

01:15:57.148 --> 01:15:59.272
It's called disorderly
conduct, and yes, we can.

01:15:59.347 --> 01:16:01.973
- We didn't fail at nothing.
- Our profession is all about control.

01:16:02.047 --> 01:16:03.775
You both failed miserably
in that department.

01:16:03.847 --> 01:16:05.642
Hold it right there.

01:16:05.714 --> 01:16:07.509
- Senior?
- Yeah, come in.

01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:12.404
Their disenrollment records.

01:16:14.213 --> 01:16:15.542
Bar fight?

01:16:17.047 --> 01:16:19.171
- All right, bring them in.
- Senior.

01:16:19.279 --> 01:16:20.609
Square it.

01:16:27.413 --> 01:16:30.606
It's all my fault, Senior Chief.
Hodge had nothing to do with it.

01:16:32.378 --> 01:16:34.571
- That true, Hodge?
- It's true.

01:16:38.478 --> 01:16:41.171
All right. Fine, you're dismissed.

01:16:41.645 --> 01:16:45.599
- Senior Chief, I was...
- I said that you are dismissed.

01:16:46.477 --> 01:16:47.738
Let's go.

01:16:54.844 --> 01:16:57.571
You're gonna kick me out
for defending the Coast Guard?

01:16:58.044 --> 01:17:00.135
The Coast Guard's been around
for 200 years.

01:17:00.210 --> 01:17:03.539
I doubt a couple of knuckleheads
like yourself are gonna defend it.

01:17:03.910 --> 01:17:05.137
Sit down.

01:17:08.643 --> 01:17:12.234
I've been trying to peel the layers
back on you for a while now, and I...

01:17:12.543 --> 01:17:13.769
I just don't get it.

01:17:15.276 --> 01:17:17.367
I mean, this kind of work
seems a little remedial

01:17:17.443 --> 01:17:18.466
for someone like yourself.

01:17:18.542 --> 01:17:20.940
You know, big swim champ,
offer to every lvy League.

01:17:21.009 --> 01:17:23.668
You give it all up to be here with us.

01:17:24.942 --> 01:17:28.430
- Why?
- I'm here to save lives, Senior Chief.

01:17:32.741 --> 01:17:34.969
I spoke with your coach, Jake.

01:17:37.175 --> 01:17:39.640
- You spoke with my coach?
- Yeah, I spoke with your coach.

01:17:39.708 --> 01:17:43.071
Something in your file
just kept hanging me up.

01:17:43.141 --> 01:17:46.596
You win the state championship
your freshman and sophomore year

01:17:46.675 --> 01:17:49.334
and then you don't swim the next two.

01:17:49.608 --> 01:17:53.040
I'm just a public school guy,
so pardon me,

01:17:53.107 --> 01:17:56.869
but it didn't add up until now.

01:18:03.073 --> 01:18:06.267
"Kirk Holloway,
100-meter medley winner,

01:18:07.106 --> 01:18:09.571
"thrown through the passenger window.

01:18:09.639 --> 01:18:11.935
"Pronounced dead at the scene.

01:18:13.439 --> 01:18:18.394
"Abe lkeman, first team All-American,
lungs crushed.

01:18:21.439 --> 01:18:25.394
"Carl Sandoval,
50-meter freestyle champ,

01:18:25.472 --> 01:18:30.097
"made it all the way to the hospital.
Died of internal bleeding."

01:18:39.638 --> 01:18:42.365
I guess you just know everything, then.

01:18:43.204 --> 01:18:45.795
I know what it's like to lose a team.

01:18:47.237 --> 01:18:48.362
Yeah?

01:18:48.637 --> 01:18:50.035
What about living in a small town

01:18:50.103 --> 01:18:52.228
where everyone thinks
that you killed their brother

01:18:52.303 --> 01:18:53.859
or their son or their best friend?

01:18:53.936 --> 01:18:55.334
You know about that?

01:18:56.270 --> 01:18:59.702
Kind of small town where everyone
still waves to everyone,

01:19:00.936 --> 01:19:02.526
just not to you?

01:19:04.936 --> 01:19:08.834
I read the report, Jake.
Your blood alcohol was zip that night.

01:19:09.870 --> 01:19:12.994
I'm guessing there was a flip
for designated driver.

01:19:13.069 --> 01:19:14.365
You lost.

01:19:15.403 --> 01:19:17.493
Guess that just makes it
all go away, huh?

01:19:17.568 --> 01:19:20.796
No, it doesn't make it all right.
It just makes it an accident.

01:19:21.301 --> 01:19:23.324
At least that's how it reads.

01:19:24.669 --> 01:19:26.328
You were 16 years old, Jake.

01:19:26.402 --> 01:19:28.924
I'm not your priest, but if I was, I think...

01:19:29.402 --> 01:19:31.493
I think maybe you'd deserve a pass.

01:19:35.035 --> 01:19:37.058
You're giving me a pass?

01:19:37.235 --> 01:19:41.360
You just think you know everything
with your psychobabble bullshit.

01:19:41.434 --> 01:19:43.457
Why am I here? Why are you here?

01:19:44.867 --> 01:19:47.561
You're too old to be doing this.
You're washed-up here.

01:19:47.634 --> 01:19:51.191
You don't wanna be teaching
a bunch of kids in a pool. Am I right?

01:19:51.267 --> 01:19:54.664
I don't give a shit what you read
or who you talked to.

01:19:54.733 --> 01:19:58.665
You don't know about me! You don't...
I have me under control.

01:20:03.199 --> 01:20:04.721
I can see that.

01:20:23.831 --> 01:20:26.592
The only difference
between you and me is,

01:20:28.132 --> 01:20:31.291
I don't wear the ones I lost
on my arm, Jake.

01:20:39.730 --> 01:20:41.958
I know where you're at, Jake.

01:20:42.864 --> 01:20:44.557
I'm there myself.

01:20:46.797 --> 01:20:50.320
I ask myself every day
why I was the one that survived.

01:20:55.630 --> 01:20:57.857
- And?
- And...

01:21:00.663 --> 01:21:02.186
And if I can't answer that for me,

01:21:02.262 --> 01:21:05.660
I'm certainly not going to try
and answer it for you.

01:21:10.462 --> 01:21:11.859
Have a seat.

01:21:18.295 --> 01:21:21.419
I want you
to start being a member of this team,

01:21:22.628 --> 01:21:24.491
the team you have now.

01:21:25.762 --> 01:21:27.660
You have a gift, Jake.

01:21:28.028 --> 01:21:30.085
You're the best swimmer
to come through this program,

01:21:30.161 --> 01:21:31.354
hands down, by far.

01:21:31.428 --> 01:21:33.360
You got a whole record board
to prove it.

01:21:33.427 --> 01:21:36.121
But you know what I see
when I look at it?

01:21:36.194 --> 01:21:39.648
I see someone fast enough
who's gonna get there first.

01:21:40.861 --> 01:21:42.985
I see someone strong enough
who's gonna last.

01:21:43.060 --> 01:21:47.754
I see someone who can save a life
that maybe nobody else could.

01:21:50.093 --> 01:21:53.218
You really wanna honor
the initials on your arm?

01:21:54.526 --> 01:21:56.355
Then honor your gift.

01:21:59.326 --> 01:22:01.451
Save the ones you can, Jake.

01:22:02.892 --> 01:22:06.256
The rest, we've gotta let go.

01:22:17.058 --> 01:22:19.183
Does this mean
you're not gonna fail me?

01:22:19.991 --> 01:22:23.753
For what, backing up a buddy in a bar?

01:22:26.658 --> 01:22:29.180
Man, I got bigger problems than you.

01:22:32.424 --> 01:22:35.947
I don't know about you,
but I could use a fucking drink.

01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:41.915
Oops.

01:22:44.423 --> 01:22:48.287
I'm gonna consider everything tonight
off-record and off-duty.

01:22:52.089 --> 01:22:53.248
That was an invite.

01:22:54.056 --> 01:22:55.044
Oh.

01:22:59.389 --> 01:23:01.355
You gotta be kidding me.

01:23:01.956 --> 01:23:05.649
- What was it they called you?
- "Puddle pirates," but it's not...

01:23:05.722 --> 01:23:09.449
I'm way over it, Senior Chief. This is...

01:23:09.921 --> 01:23:13.285
- Well, it's like sticks and stones.
- Well, we'll just have one beer.

01:23:19.655 --> 01:23:23.519
Great. They're angrier
and drunker. Perfect.

01:23:23.588 --> 01:23:25.985
Hi. Two beers.

01:23:26.987 --> 01:23:29.612
- You gotta be kidding me.
- That's what I said.

01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:33.146
Look, I don't want any trouble, okay?

01:23:36.121 --> 01:23:38.552
They really don't like us, do they?

01:23:38.620 --> 01:23:43.052
No. They think they're better than us
because they're combat-oriented.

01:23:44.220 --> 01:23:46.345
We're the Coast Guard, Jake.

01:23:46.453 --> 01:23:49.612
Nobody really appreciates us
until they need us.

01:23:52.153 --> 01:23:53.413
That him?

01:24:01.352 --> 01:24:02.409
Yep.

01:24:07.818 --> 01:24:11.147
So let me ask you a question
before we start bleeding.

01:24:12.818 --> 01:24:16.840
All those saves...
What's your real number?

01:24:23.784 --> 01:24:27.147
Do you have a death wish,
or are you just shit-stupid?

01:24:28.484 --> 01:24:30.972
I'm gonna go with stupid this time.

01:24:31.050 --> 01:24:32.913
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:24:32.983 --> 01:24:35.040
Who's this, your old man?

01:24:41.117 --> 01:24:43.548
You know,
I'm really glad you're still here.

01:24:43.616 --> 01:24:45.275
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:24:53.615 --> 01:24:56.343
- Behind you.
- Stand down! I said stand down.

01:25:03.515 --> 01:25:05.504
I think you better leave.

01:25:08.482 --> 01:25:09.573
Okay.

01:25:12.048 --> 01:25:13.536
Come on, Jake.

01:25:20.147 --> 01:25:22.545
All right, sit down. Have a beer.

01:25:23.614 --> 01:25:26.239
- That went a lot better than I thought.
- Yeah.

01:25:27.014 --> 01:25:30.037
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know.

01:25:30.580 --> 01:25:34.376
Hey, I wanted to apologize to you

01:25:35.713 --> 01:25:38.838
for what I said earlier about you
being old and washed-up now.

01:25:41.446 --> 01:25:44.843
Is there anything
you'd like to say to me?

01:25:45.213 --> 01:25:46.236
Like what?

01:25:47.346 --> 01:25:49.311
I don't know, but I apologized to you.

01:25:49.379 --> 01:25:51.141
I just thought that, you know,

01:25:51.212 --> 01:25:53.440
there might be something
you've said or done

01:25:53.512 --> 01:25:55.478
that you'd like to apologize to me for.

01:25:55.545 --> 01:25:56.602
Why?

01:25:58.312 --> 01:26:00.505
'Cause that's how it's done. I...

01:26:00.878 --> 01:26:03.174
You suck at apologies, you know that?

01:26:03.278 --> 01:26:05.267
I mean,
you're missing the whole concept.

01:26:16.111 --> 01:26:19.305
- Hello?
- <i>Hi. It's me.</i>

01:26:21.810 --> 01:26:25.367
Are you okay? What happened?
I mean, I waited for two hours.

01:26:25.677 --> 01:26:29.803
Yeah. No. Look, I'm really sorry. I...

01:26:30.377 --> 01:26:31.570
What happened?

01:26:31.677 --> 01:26:34.438
<i>It's a really long story.</i>

01:26:35.976 --> 01:26:39.533
Let me just... Let me put it this way.

01:26:40.709 --> 01:26:45.368
It was the best worst night of my life.

01:26:46.609 --> 01:26:48.404
Well, I'm glad someone had fun.

01:26:53.742 --> 01:26:56.606
Can I see you tomorrow night?

01:26:57.009 --> 01:26:59.270
I have parent-teacher conferences
tomorrow.

01:27:00.274 --> 01:27:01.900
What about the next night?

01:27:02.508 --> 01:27:04.667
I have parent-teacher conferences
all week.

01:27:06.074 --> 01:27:09.063
- You blowing me off?
- <i>No, Jake.</i>

01:27:10.274 --> 01:27:11.967
I wouldn't do that to somebody.

01:27:14.074 --> 01:27:17.006
<i>I gotta get up in a couple hours.</i>
<i>I gotta go.</i>

01:27:17.173 --> 01:27:20.139
- Yep.
- <i>Goodbye.</i>

01:27:30.673 --> 01:27:32.935
All right, you know what
we briefed on the ground.

01:27:33.007 --> 01:27:35.632
Same thing.
We're gonna stay together.

01:27:35.706 --> 01:27:39.570
No matter what happens out there,
you stay together.

01:27:40.006 --> 01:27:44.665
Whatever decision you make,
you make as a team.

01:27:47.739 --> 01:27:50.899
<i>We trained to freefall at 15 to 20 feet.</i>

01:27:51.538 --> 01:27:54.867
<i>You fall from 50 feet,</i>
<i>it's like hitting concrete.</i>

01:27:55.271 --> 01:27:59.067
<i>You fall 80 to 100 feet, you die.</i>

01:28:06.170 --> 01:28:07.568
Hey, where they going?

01:28:07.638 --> 01:28:09.331
They're supposed to come back
for us, right?

01:28:09.404 --> 01:28:11.427
I don't know.
Well, Hodge, you been here before.

01:28:11.504 --> 01:28:12.663
They're gonna come back for us, right?

01:28:12.738 --> 01:28:14.999
Yeah, but I never made it this far.

01:28:15.070 --> 01:28:17.661
- You're kidding.
- Not to the final week.

01:28:18.536 --> 01:28:20.502
They're not coming back.

01:28:21.104 --> 01:28:24.365
- What do we do?
- All right, listen up.

01:28:25.037 --> 01:28:26.968
We stay together as a group.

01:28:27.036 --> 01:28:29.525
Nobody falls behind.
We all stay together.

01:28:29.603 --> 01:28:32.467
One guy goes back,
we get him back up to the front, okay?

01:28:32.536 --> 01:28:34.297
We're a team. Oorah.

01:28:34.370 --> 01:28:36.063
- Oorah.
- Oorah!

01:28:36.136 --> 01:28:37.897
Let's do it, 5506.

01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:17.225
Sir, it's okay,
I'm with the US Coast Guard.

01:29:43.932 --> 01:29:45.159
Again.

01:29:52.864 --> 01:29:56.194
I'm a Coast Guard rescue swimmer.
I'm here to help you.

01:29:57.498 --> 01:29:58.793
Time-out.

01:29:58.864 --> 01:30:00.194
Class, pop tall.

01:30:00.264 --> 01:30:03.196
Hodge, get yourself
to the side of the pool.

01:30:03.263 --> 01:30:04.661
Aye, aye, Senior Chief.

01:30:08.163 --> 01:30:09.527
Oorah!

01:30:18.997 --> 01:30:20.257
Easy, Chief.

01:30:21.963 --> 01:30:23.724
Guess it was a lucky punch.

01:30:27.463 --> 01:30:28.622
Hodge!

01:30:31.463 --> 01:30:33.894
- You all right, Chief?
- You stay right there!

01:30:43.829 --> 01:30:45.556
Well done, Charlie.

01:30:48.594 --> 01:30:49.958
Well done.

01:30:51.794 --> 01:30:53.657
Oorah, Chief Skinner.

01:30:54.361 --> 01:30:57.486
Class 5506, "Oorah, Hodge," on three!

01:30:57.561 --> 01:30:59.459
One, two, three.

01:30:59.527 --> 01:31:01.186
Oorah, Hodge!

01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:04.426
Good for you.

01:31:11.326 --> 01:31:12.383
Get their gear off.

01:31:12.460 --> 01:31:14.858
- Go on, get that gear off.
- Get that gear off!

01:31:28.292 --> 01:31:29.656
Get it off!

01:31:33.258 --> 01:31:37.281
Class 5506,
will you come find me if I am lost?

01:31:37.958 --> 01:31:39.548
Yes, Senior Chief!

01:31:40.925 --> 01:31:43.550
Will you come save me
if I am drowning?

01:31:43.625 --> 01:31:45.250
Yes, Senior Chief!

01:31:50.324 --> 01:31:52.085
I believe you would.

01:31:53.091 --> 01:31:55.613
I have high hopes for this class.

01:32:02.357 --> 01:32:04.380
I have high hopes for you.

01:32:08.056 --> 01:32:10.988
<i>Matthew Stokes, Savannah, Georgia.</i>

01:32:11.123 --> 01:32:13.453
Matthew, a job well done.
Oorah, Captain.

01:32:14.457 --> 01:32:17.547
<i>Kenneth Weatherly,</i>
<i>Clearwater, Florida.</i>

01:32:17.656 --> 01:32:19.281
Go out there and do great things.

01:32:19.823 --> 01:32:22.550
<i>William Hodge, Astoria, Oregon.</i>

01:32:24.055 --> 01:32:25.316
Where's Senior Chief?

01:32:25.389 --> 01:32:27.786
He had a chance to go back to Kodiak
and he took it.

01:32:27.855 --> 01:32:29.378
He never had
much of a bedside manner.

01:32:29.456 --> 01:32:30.944
He's a water dog, Jake,

01:32:31.022 --> 01:32:34.045
and as it turns out,
not a half-bad teacher.

01:32:34.122 --> 01:32:35.485
Best of luck.

01:32:35.555 --> 01:32:38.885
<i>Jacob Fischer, Kodiak, Alaska.</i>

01:32:41.455 --> 01:32:43.886
Congratulations, Jake.
Make us proud up there.

01:32:43.954 --> 01:32:45.420
Aye, aye, Captain.

01:32:45.488 --> 01:32:48.420
<i>Scott Reeves, Sitka, Alaska.</i>

01:32:49.054 --> 01:32:51.713
Ladies and gentlemen, your graduates.

01:32:52.121 --> 01:32:53.109
Oorah!

01:32:59.253 --> 01:33:01.048
- Congratulations.
- Thanks a lot.

01:33:02.420 --> 01:33:04.443
- Good job, guys.
- Good luck.

01:33:25.285 --> 01:33:28.274
- Well, congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:33:34.818 --> 01:33:36.148
It's okay.

01:33:36.818 --> 01:33:39.011
We both knew
where this was going, right?

01:33:39.651 --> 01:33:40.947
Just casual.

01:33:42.784 --> 01:33:43.943
Right.

01:33:47.351 --> 01:33:49.976
To getting what you've always wanted.

01:33:51.917 --> 01:33:53.906
And always wanting more.

01:33:56.717 --> 01:33:58.842
Take care of yourself, Jake.

01:34:13.716 --> 01:34:16.012
- I gotta go to work.
- Yeah.

01:34:31.648 --> 01:34:32.705
Bye.

01:35:47.177 --> 01:35:49.972
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the Rock.

01:35:50.710 --> 01:35:53.904
I'm Captain William Hadley,
CO of Kodiak Air Station.

01:35:54.344 --> 01:35:56.366
- Fischer.
- Yeah, right here.

01:35:56.443 --> 01:35:58.966
Mr. Mitcheltree will square you away.

01:35:59.043 --> 01:36:01.201
The rest of you,
step up here with Mr. Christiansen.

01:36:01.276 --> 01:36:03.242
He will process you in.

01:36:18.075 --> 01:36:19.541
Oh, amazing.

01:36:20.175 --> 01:36:21.970
Not only does he come back
in great shape,

01:36:22.041 --> 01:36:23.768
but he still thinks he can cook.

01:36:23.841 --> 01:36:26.000
- Hello, Jake. Welcome.
- How you doing?

01:36:26.108 --> 01:36:28.699
- Good to see you again.
- You guys keep it warm here, huh?

01:36:28.774 --> 01:36:30.933
Glad to know
you know where a free meal is.

01:36:31.341 --> 01:36:33.103
We need three crews in Sitka
for the weekend.

01:36:33.174 --> 01:36:34.538
You make sure that happens.

01:36:34.608 --> 01:36:36.870
And the stand team arrives here
next Tuesday.

01:36:37.541 --> 01:36:40.132
Patch things up with the wife?

01:36:42.040 --> 01:36:44.733
You fix things up with that young lady?

01:36:45.974 --> 01:36:48.735
Well, you still have a choice, you know.

01:36:51.107 --> 01:36:55.266
Hey, there's a question
I wanted to ask you back in school

01:36:56.039 --> 01:36:57.130
and I didn't.

01:36:58.139 --> 01:37:01.264
But when you can't save them all,

01:37:03.273 --> 01:37:05.397
how do you choose who lives?

01:37:06.872 --> 01:37:09.804
It's probably different
for everybody, Jake.

01:37:10.906 --> 01:37:13.667
Kind of simple for me, though. I just...

01:37:14.005 --> 01:37:18.097
I take the first one I come to
or the weakest one in the group,

01:37:18.172 --> 01:37:21.831
and then I swim
as fast and as hard as I can

01:37:22.871 --> 01:37:24.427
for as long as I can.

01:37:26.571 --> 01:37:28.696
And the sea takes the rest.

01:37:33.770 --> 01:37:35.361
Think I'm ready?

01:37:37.204 --> 01:37:41.465
I'm not your teacher anymore, Jake.
I'm just your fellow swimmer.

01:37:41.537 --> 01:37:44.594
That's not exactly
the answer I'm looking for there.

01:37:44.670 --> 01:37:48.625
If I did not think you were ready,
I would not put you in the Bering Sea.

01:37:54.502 --> 01:37:56.764
<i>6030, this is Kodiak Ops Cent.</i>

01:37:56.836 --> 01:37:58.961
<i>We are diverting your training mission</i>
<i>at this time.</i>

01:37:59.036 --> 01:38:01.001
<i>We have two young kayakers</i>
<i>swept into the cave</i>

01:38:01.069 --> 01:38:02.501
<i>one mile south of Saltery Cove.</i>

01:38:02.569 --> 01:38:04.694
- <i>How copy?</i>
- <i>6030 copies.</i>

01:38:04.768 --> 01:38:07.132
- <i>We're diverting at this time.</i>
- <i>We've got a real case now.</i>

01:38:07.202 --> 01:38:08.929
<i>Okay, guys, that tide's coming in,</i>

01:38:09.002 --> 01:38:11.559
<i>and we've got six- to eight-foot rollers</i>
<i>coming from the north.</i>

01:38:11.635 --> 01:38:14.260
<i>Senior, what do you think</i>
<i>about taking Fischer with you on this?</i>

01:38:14.335 --> 01:38:17.062
<i>I want him with me.</i>
<i>All right? He's good to go.</i>

01:38:17.602 --> 01:38:20.124
<i>I don't think it's gonna be</i>
<i>a problem sliding in there.</i>

01:38:20.201 --> 01:38:22.962
<i>I think the problem's gonna be</i>
<i>coming back out.</i>

01:38:23.034 --> 01:38:26.057
<i>That's why I got Jake with me.</i>
<i>Got my human speedboat.</i>

01:38:28.601 --> 01:38:33.034
<i>Kodiak Ops, this is 6030.</i>
<i>We're on-scene at this time.</i>

01:38:34.901 --> 01:38:37.923
<i>No sign of kayakers.</i>
<i>I'm taking her down.</i>

01:38:42.833 --> 01:38:44.731
<i>Cabin door is open and locked.</i>

01:38:45.100 --> 01:38:46.759
<i>Those are definitely</i>
<i>ten-foot waves.</i>

01:38:48.533 --> 01:38:50.726
<i>Swimmer's coming to the door.</i>

01:38:53.032 --> 01:38:54.555
Remember, all right?

01:38:54.633 --> 01:38:58.997
You got the whole weight of the ocean
punching through that opening.

01:38:59.066 --> 01:39:02.463
You gotta read the hydraulics,
gotta count the waves,

01:39:02.865 --> 01:39:04.831
then wait for the flush.

01:39:06.265 --> 01:39:07.891
<i>Checking swimmer.</i>

01:39:08.632 --> 01:39:12.120
<i>Sure as hell hope</i>
<i>you paid attention in class, Speedboat.</i>

01:39:34.164 --> 01:39:36.027
<i>Swimmers in the water.</i>

01:39:36.264 --> 01:39:37.786
<i>Swimmers okay.</i>

01:39:42.496 --> 01:39:45.587
<i>Swimmer Two is making contact</i>
<i>with Swimmer One.</i>

01:40:21.494 --> 01:40:22.517
Hey!

01:40:22.827 --> 01:40:23.850
Over here!

01:40:23.927 --> 01:40:25.722
- Here.
- Over here!

01:40:25.794 --> 01:40:27.317
Got them. Three o'clock.

01:40:27.827 --> 01:40:29.191
Right here.

01:40:33.093 --> 01:40:35.423
We're rescue swimmers.
We're gonna get you out of here.

01:40:35.493 --> 01:40:37.516
Can't believe
you guys actually got here.

01:40:37.594 --> 01:40:39.150
Give me your hand.

01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:42.353
Just the two of you?

01:40:42.426 --> 01:40:44.017
Yeah, yeah. His arm's hurt real bad.

01:40:44.093 --> 01:40:45.422
All right.

01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:51.217
Swimmer One. I got two survivors.
It's gonna be a basket pickup here.

01:40:51.292 --> 01:40:52.315
Roger.

01:40:52.392 --> 01:40:53.483
Broken here?

01:40:53.559 --> 01:40:56.354
You take him first.
Get him in the basket.

01:40:57.225 --> 01:40:59.350
I'll follow with the other one
right behind you.

01:40:59.425 --> 01:41:00.482
- You got that?
- Yeah.

01:41:00.558 --> 01:41:01.546
- You got it?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:41:01.625 --> 01:41:03.648
All right. I'm gonna lower you down
in here, all right?

01:41:03.725 --> 01:41:05.918
- Okay.
- Relax, buddy. I got you.

01:41:07.458 --> 01:41:08.788
All right.

01:41:09.224 --> 01:41:11.053
- You're with me.
- Okay.

01:41:19.924 --> 01:41:21.719
I don't swim so good.

01:41:21.857 --> 01:41:24.652
- You don't swim so good?
- No, sir.

01:41:24.724 --> 01:41:28.679
It's okay. I swim pretty good.
All right, on your back.

01:41:44.456 --> 01:41:48.286
- Wait. Are we gonna take the boat?
- I'm the boat.

01:41:48.356 --> 01:41:49.821
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

01:41:49.889 --> 01:41:52.446
- I'm not ready! I can't...
- Hey!

01:41:52.522 --> 01:41:55.249
- Wait, wait, wait...
- Settle down!

01:42:14.621 --> 01:42:15.916
<i>Something's not right.</i>

01:42:15.987 --> 01:42:18.078
<i>Swimmer One's going back</i>
<i>to the cave.</i>

01:42:49.185 --> 01:42:50.674
What happened?

01:42:51.452 --> 01:42:52.917
He hit a log.

01:42:53.918 --> 01:42:55.713
What? What are you...

01:42:56.851 --> 01:42:58.680
What...

01:43:10.618 --> 01:43:12.708
- He's gone, Jake.
- He's not.

01:43:15.151 --> 01:43:17.480
He's just got a head laceration.

01:43:22.250 --> 01:43:24.773
Here we go. Come on.

01:43:27.016 --> 01:43:28.243
Let's go.

01:43:30.350 --> 01:43:31.610
Let's go!

01:43:35.150 --> 01:43:39.206
Senior Chief Randall! Lock it in.

01:43:42.416 --> 01:43:43.473
It's simple physics.

01:43:43.549 --> 01:43:46.379
We're just gonna time the flush,
all right?

01:43:50.115 --> 01:43:51.410
All right.

01:43:52.082 --> 01:43:53.877
You call it, Swimmer.

01:44:01.181 --> 01:44:02.169
Now!

01:44:12.714 --> 01:44:16.646
Hey, I know you're tired, okay?
I know you feel tired right now.

01:44:16.714 --> 01:44:19.236
But you need
to keep your eyes open, okay?

01:44:19.347 --> 01:44:22.642
All right? All right?
Hey, I need you to keep talking to him.

01:44:22.713 --> 01:44:24.406
- You keep talking to him.
- Okay.

01:44:24.479 --> 01:44:26.274
Senior. Senior!

01:44:27.346 --> 01:44:29.608
Can you open these up for me?

01:44:30.012 --> 01:44:32.740
One by one,
I want you to hand them to me.

01:44:32.979 --> 01:44:34.104
Reyes!

01:44:34.179 --> 01:44:35.509
He's fine.

01:44:37.379 --> 01:44:39.106
Right here, buddy. Right here. Okay?

01:44:39.179 --> 01:44:40.202
- Okay.
- Right here.

01:44:47.011 --> 01:44:48.739
- Robert!
- I'm okay.

01:44:48.812 --> 01:44:50.902
He's got a compound fracture
in his right radius.

01:44:50.978 --> 01:44:53.069
We tried to stabilize that a little bit.

01:44:53.145 --> 01:44:54.304
We put a collar on this one,

01:44:54.378 --> 01:44:56.003
but it's more precautionary
than anything.

01:44:56.078 --> 01:44:57.135
Thank you.

01:44:57.211 --> 01:44:59.233
This one's possibly
a little bit concussive.

01:44:59.311 --> 01:45:01.243
We checked their vitals
the whole way back.

01:45:01.311 --> 01:45:04.471
They're both mildly hypothermic,
but I think they'll come around.

01:45:06.678 --> 01:45:08.303
Thank you so much.

01:45:11.477 --> 01:45:13.067
You're welcome.

01:45:16.977 --> 01:45:18.602
It happens, Ben.

01:45:19.910 --> 01:45:22.740
Not to me. Not like that.

01:45:25.143 --> 01:45:29.041
I want you to sign them in front of me.

01:45:29.742 --> 01:45:31.640
Why don't you take some time
and think about it?

01:45:31.709 --> 01:45:33.073
No. It's...

01:45:34.375 --> 01:45:38.205
It's over. Just sign them.

01:45:44.208 --> 01:45:45.401
Please.

01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:11.765
Could've happened to anyone.

01:46:12.407 --> 01:46:13.566
Maybe.

01:46:14.040 --> 01:46:17.200
But what if it happens again?
What then?

01:46:18.206 --> 01:46:20.865
Kid got a couple stitches.
He's gonna be fine.

01:46:20.940 --> 01:46:22.769
We got him out of there.

01:46:23.206 --> 01:46:24.603
No, you did.

01:46:25.239 --> 01:46:27.535
You were strong out there today.

01:46:28.939 --> 01:46:30.701
I was proud of you.

01:46:33.772 --> 01:46:35.567
What are you gonna do?

01:46:36.272 --> 01:46:38.897
Friend of mine once suggested fishing.

01:46:40.605 --> 01:46:42.833
Think I might take his advice.

01:46:43.371 --> 01:46:44.598
Fishing?

01:46:45.004 --> 01:46:46.095
Yeah.

01:46:46.438 --> 01:46:48.903
Guys like us don't go fishing.

01:46:50.138 --> 01:46:52.434
Where have I heard that before?

01:46:59.904 --> 01:47:03.165
Senior, before you go,

01:47:04.270 --> 01:47:06.168
I gotta know one thing.

01:47:06.803 --> 01:47:08.769
What's your real number?

01:47:13.970 --> 01:47:15.333
Twenty-two.

01:47:18.236 --> 01:47:19.566
Twenty-two?

01:47:21.736 --> 01:47:25.827
That's not bad. It's not 200. It's not...

01:47:25.902 --> 01:47:28.959
Twenty-two's the number of people
I lost, Jake.

01:47:30.136 --> 01:47:32.260
Only number I kept track of.

01:47:50.568 --> 01:47:52.864
Keeps the sea out of your mouth.

01:48:31.865 --> 01:48:32.888
Hey.

01:48:33.698 --> 01:48:34.686
Hi.

01:48:37.299 --> 01:48:39.389
You started painting again?

01:48:40.364 --> 01:48:42.455
Yeah. Great light up there.

01:48:50.697 --> 01:48:51.958
You know,

01:48:53.630 --> 01:48:56.653
I wanna apologize
for the phone calls, Helen.

01:48:58.196 --> 01:49:00.594
I should've given you your space.

01:49:01.963 --> 01:49:03.792
And you felt
showing up here unannounced

01:49:03.863 --> 01:49:06.455
was the best way to communicate that?

01:49:12.629 --> 01:49:13.652
Hey.

01:49:38.827 --> 01:49:40.225
- Please just...
- Ben.

01:49:40.295 --> 01:49:44.352
I want you to have it, along with these.

01:49:46.761 --> 01:49:48.249
I signed them.

01:49:54.360 --> 01:49:55.587
Why now?

01:50:03.560 --> 01:50:06.458
I had a... I had a case a while back.

01:50:06.526 --> 01:50:08.890
You know, a couple was drowning.

01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:12.786
By the time I got there,

01:50:12.859 --> 01:50:16.121
the husband
was dragging his wife under,

01:50:17.026 --> 01:50:19.254
just trying to stay afloat.

01:50:20.759 --> 01:50:23.055
Pure survival instinct.

01:50:25.925 --> 01:50:27.391
It took me...

01:50:29.258 --> 01:50:34.656
Took me a long time to understand
that that man was me.

01:50:39.224 --> 01:50:42.156
Oh, man. Oh, doggone it.

01:50:47.257 --> 01:50:48.416
Sorry.

01:50:50.456 --> 01:50:52.615
Aren't you gonna answer that?

01:50:56.156 --> 01:50:58.850
I'm not a rescue swimmer anymore,
Helen.

01:51:25.655 --> 01:51:26.951
Bye, baby.

01:51:54.387 --> 01:51:55.410
Lock it up.

01:51:55.487 --> 01:51:58.351
We have a 75-foot fishing vessel
in distress,

01:51:58.420 --> 01:52:00.385
taking on water in high seas.

01:52:01.486 --> 01:52:04.646
<i>She's dead in the water</i>
<i>with four souls onboard.</i>

01:52:05.052 --> 01:52:07.950
<i>With its dewatering pumps</i>
<i>unable to keep up,</i>

01:52:08.252 --> 01:52:11.877
<i>it's not a matter of</i>
<i>if this thing is going down, but when.</i>

01:52:34.417 --> 01:52:37.645
Tighten her down!
We gotta secure her.

01:52:50.516 --> 01:52:54.642
<i>There will come a time</i>
<i>when you're going to have to say no.</i>

01:52:56.216 --> 01:53:02.410
<i>You'll be facing crews from five to 20,</i>
<i>all saying, "Save me, save me."</i>

01:53:02.982 --> 01:53:05.175
<i>They're looking for a miracle.</i>

01:53:06.415 --> 01:53:07.904
<i>At 24 years old,</i>

01:53:07.982 --> 01:53:11.107
<i>you have to find a way</i>
<i>to be that miracle.</i>

01:53:11.315 --> 01:53:13.747
<i>Sounds good. We'll plan</i>
<i>our free-fall deployment to the water.</i>

01:53:13.815 --> 01:53:15.542
- <i>Are you good with that, Jake?</i>
- <i>Yeah, copy that.</i>

01:53:15.615 --> 01:53:18.842
<i>Okay, if we have to put you in,</i>
<i>we're gonna get you in upswell</i>

01:53:18.915 --> 01:53:20.881
<i>and let the waves</i>
<i>take you down to the boat.</i>

01:53:20.948 --> 01:53:22.811
- <i>Are you good with that?</i>
- <i>Roger.</i>

01:53:22.881 --> 01:53:25.245
<i>We're only gonna have</i>
<i>about 20 minutes on-scene,</i>

01:53:25.314 --> 01:53:27.644
- <i>so we gotta be quick.</i>
- <i>Copy that.</i>

01:53:27.748 --> 01:53:31.441
<i>All right, I got the vessel in sight.</i>
<i>Two o'clock, about 50 meters.</i>

01:53:38.680 --> 01:53:40.646
<i>Cabin door open and locked.</i>

01:53:40.713 --> 01:53:43.179
<i>Pre-rescue checklist</i>
<i>for free-fall deployment.</i>

01:53:44.680 --> 01:53:46.077
<i>Whoa, whoa!</i>
<i>Boat just took a wave, sir.</i>

01:53:46.146 --> 01:53:47.544
<i>One appears to have gone</i>
<i>on the edge.</i>

01:53:47.613 --> 01:53:48.806
<i>He's hanging from the cargo net.</i>

01:53:50.079 --> 01:53:51.602
<i>We need to get our swimmer</i>
<i>down there.</i>

01:53:51.680 --> 01:53:53.202
<i>Computer's showing 60 knots...</i>

01:53:53.280 --> 01:53:54.768
<i>Going off com.</i>

01:53:55.113 --> 01:53:57.977
<i>Prepare for a free-fall deployment</i>
<i>of the rescue swimmer.</i>

01:54:01.445 --> 01:54:03.104
<i>Rescue checklist, part two.</i>

01:54:03.178 --> 01:54:04.644
<i>Swimmer's getting ready.</i>

01:54:04.712 --> 01:54:06.769
<i>Rescue checklist complete.</i>
<i>Swimmer's coming out.</i>

01:54:06.845 --> 01:54:08.834
<i>Roger that. Check swimmer.</i>

01:54:09.078 --> 01:54:11.976
<i>Swimmer's at the door, sir.</i>
<i>Checking swimmer.</i>

01:54:12.045 --> 01:54:13.533
<i>Swimmer ready?</i>

01:54:14.212 --> 01:54:16.404
<i>God help you if you ain't, boy.</i>

01:54:20.278 --> 01:54:21.801
<i>Swimmer's away.</i>

01:54:30.710 --> 01:54:33.801
<i>Swimmer's okay.</i>
<i>He's heading towards the vessel.</i>

01:54:40.343 --> 01:54:43.831
<i>All right, he's cutting</i>
<i>through those waves pretty good.</i>

01:55:03.642 --> 01:55:06.074
<i>That's it. He's approaching the vessel.</i>

01:55:06.642 --> 01:55:08.540
<i>He's at the boat, sir.</i>

01:55:14.341 --> 01:55:17.068
Man, are we glad to see you!

01:55:28.974 --> 01:55:31.337
<i>Kodiak Ops, rescue 6034.</i>

01:55:31.407 --> 01:55:33.635
<i>Fischer's onboard,</i>
<i>but vessel is compromised.</i>

01:55:33.706 --> 01:55:35.968
<i>Taking on lots of water.</i>
<i>May not hold much longer.</i>

01:55:36.040 --> 01:55:37.097
<i>Stand by for further.</i>

01:55:37.573 --> 01:55:40.199
How many guys you got on here?
Is anybody injured?

01:55:40.274 --> 01:55:41.398
I got four guys.

01:55:41.473 --> 01:55:43.336
This guy's got a broken leg.

01:55:43.406 --> 01:55:46.133
The skipper's down below.
He's trying to start the pumps.

01:55:46.206 --> 01:55:49.036
- All right, he's gonna go up first.
- All right.

01:55:49.339 --> 01:55:52.668
<i>Kodiak Ops, Kodiak Ops,</i>
<i>this is rescue 6034.</i>

01:55:52.739 --> 01:55:55.069
<i>There's three onboard with injuries,</i>
<i>one more down below.</i>

01:55:56.339 --> 01:55:58.395
<i>What do you want me to do?</i>

01:56:08.038 --> 01:56:10.231
You there,
help me get him around in here.

01:56:10.871 --> 01:56:12.996
- Bring him on in.
- All right.

01:56:28.037 --> 01:56:30.026
Basket is on its way up.

01:56:37.537 --> 01:56:39.002
Strap in. Strap in!

01:56:39.069 --> 01:56:41.864
The captain's down below,
and there's one other man on deck.

01:56:41.936 --> 01:56:44.368
Help him out. Strap yourself in.
Get out of the way.

01:56:44.436 --> 01:56:48.027
<i>I repeat, the boat's going</i>
<i>down fast. Eight minutes to bingo.</i>

01:56:52.269 --> 01:56:54.962
All right, come on, get in the basket.

01:57:00.735 --> 01:57:03.201
<i>I have</i>
<i>the ready-for-pickup signal.</i>

01:57:04.501 --> 01:57:05.797
Hold on.

01:57:08.102 --> 01:57:10.499
<i>Swimmer One, Swimmer One,</i>
<i>come in.</i>

01:57:11.835 --> 01:57:13.925
<i>Rescue swimmer, 6034.</i>

01:57:14.001 --> 01:57:15.899
<i>Fischer. Come in, Fischer.</i>

01:57:15.967 --> 01:57:18.195
<i>Swimmer One, Swimmer One,</i>
<i>come in.</i>

01:57:18.268 --> 01:57:21.132
- <i>This is Swimmer One.</i>
- <i>Roger that, Swimmer One. Go ahead.</i>

01:57:21.201 --> 01:57:24.257
<i>Swimmer One. I got one down</i>
<i>below. I'm gonna go down there.</i>

01:57:24.333 --> 01:57:27.822
<i>Swimmer One, be advised</i>
<i>we've got seven minutes to bingo.</i>

01:57:27.934 --> 01:57:29.456
I'm going down.

01:57:41.432 --> 01:57:43.159
- Captain?
- Yeah!

01:57:43.332 --> 01:57:44.423
Captain?

01:57:48.432 --> 01:57:52.228
Captain! I'm a rescue swimmer.
I'm here to help you out.

01:57:52.299 --> 01:57:55.822
Your leg is jammed in here?
Or is it just closed...

01:57:55.899 --> 01:57:57.626
It's the whole leg!

01:57:57.899 --> 01:58:00.831
I tried to free the clutch and got stuck.

01:58:02.465 --> 01:58:03.953
This is Swimmer One.

01:58:04.031 --> 01:58:06.520
I got the captain down here
in the engine room. He's stuck.

01:58:06.598 --> 01:58:07.927
<i>We're gonna be a little bit.</i>

01:58:07.998 --> 01:58:09.430
<i>Swimmer One, we're about out of time.</i>

01:58:09.497 --> 01:58:12.089
<i>That boat's listing bad,</i>
<i>and we're two minutes to bingo.</i>

01:58:12.164 --> 01:58:14.561
I ain't leaving here without him.

01:58:15.831 --> 01:58:18.524
Send somebody back for us,
'cause I'm staying down here with him.

01:58:18.597 --> 01:58:21.620
<i>Negative, Swimmer One.</i>
<i>We need you topside ASAP.</i>

01:58:22.830 --> 01:58:25.194
<i>Swimmer One, 6034.</i>

01:58:25.863 --> 01:58:28.261
<i>Swimmer One, 6034.</i>

01:58:28.863 --> 01:58:32.091
<i>Kodiak Ops, Kodiak Ops,</i>
<i>this is 6034.</i>

01:58:32.162 --> 01:58:34.492
<i>Be advised we are RTB at this time.</i>

01:58:34.563 --> 01:58:36.586
<i>We are leaving the rescue swimmer</i>
<i>on-scene.</i>

01:58:36.663 --> 01:58:38.821
<i>I say again, we are leaving</i>
<i>our rescue swimmer on-scene.</i>

01:58:38.896 --> 01:58:40.328
Who do we have left in the shop?

01:58:40.396 --> 01:58:42.487
08's all we've got left, sir, but no crew.

01:58:42.562 --> 01:58:44.051
- All right, get her online.
- Yes, sir.

01:58:44.129 --> 01:58:47.220
Lieutenant Krauss, suit up.
We're handling this.

01:58:48.362 --> 01:58:49.988
I need a swimmer.

01:58:52.328 --> 01:58:53.692
Don't worry.

01:58:53.795 --> 01:58:55.522
No, no, they'll get him.

01:58:55.595 --> 01:58:56.719
Don't worry! Don't worry.

01:59:10.194 --> 01:59:11.592
Here we go.

01:59:27.593 --> 01:59:29.252
Hold on. Hold on.

01:59:35.492 --> 01:59:37.617
- Ready to go home?
- Yeah, man.

01:59:53.525 --> 01:59:55.151
Captain. Captain!

02:00:10.057 --> 02:00:12.818
- Are we cleared in, Lieutenant?
- Aye, aye, Captain.

02:00:12.891 --> 02:00:14.288
Outstanding.

02:00:31.056 --> 02:00:33.851
<i>Rescue Swimmer One, this is 6008.</i>

02:00:33.923 --> 02:00:35.013
<i>Do you read?</i>

02:00:35.089 --> 02:00:38.919
<i>Come in, Rescue Swimmer One.</i>
<i>6008. Do you read?</i>

02:00:39.655 --> 02:00:41.621
<i>Come on, Jake, be there.</i>

02:00:58.821 --> 02:01:02.254
<i>Cabin door's coming</i>
<i>open. Cabin door's open and locked.</i>

02:01:03.021 --> 02:01:06.282
<i>All right, right there.</i>
<i>Right side. Nobody onboard.</i>

02:01:07.254 --> 02:01:09.117
All right. I see what I want.

02:01:09.187 --> 02:01:11.948
Just get me down.
The right-hand corner.

02:01:12.020 --> 02:01:13.610
Try to avoid the rigging.

02:01:13.686 --> 02:01:15.743
<i>Okay, swimmer requests</i>
<i>aft right-hand corner.</i>

02:01:15.820 --> 02:01:17.218
<i>Aft right-hand corner.</i>

02:01:17.287 --> 02:01:18.616
<i>Okay, this is what we're gonna do.</i>

02:01:18.686 --> 02:01:20.276
<i>Start a rescue checklist, part two,</i>

02:01:20.353 --> 02:01:22.285
<i>for a harness deployment</i>
<i>of the rescue swimmer.</i>

02:01:22.353 --> 02:01:24.615
- <i>No trail line...</i>
- <i>Roger that. Backup pump is on.</i>

02:01:24.686 --> 02:01:26.276
<i>All right, we'll do the hoist at 100 feet.</i>

02:01:26.353 --> 02:01:27.683
<i>Roger that.</i>

02:01:28.719 --> 02:01:31.583
<i>Kodiak Ops, Kodiak Ops,</i>
<i>rescue 6028.</i>

02:01:31.652 --> 02:01:34.709
<i>Rescue 6028,</i>
<i>Kodiak Ops. Go ahead.</i>

02:01:35.119 --> 02:01:37.778
<i>Swimmer's ready.</i>
<i>Load-checking swimmer.</i>

02:01:39.552 --> 02:01:42.780
<i>And load check complete.</i>
<i>Swimmer's going out the door.</i>

02:01:42.852 --> 02:01:46.079
<i>Swimmer's out the door.</i>
<i>Swimmer's on his way down.</i>

02:02:01.150 --> 02:02:03.378
Coast Guard helo, do you copy?

02:02:04.950 --> 02:02:07.677
Coast Guard helo,
this is Rescue Swimmer One.

02:02:07.750 --> 02:02:08.773
Do you copy?

02:02:08.850 --> 02:02:10.111
<i>Forward, right 40.</i>

02:02:10.184 --> 02:02:11.706
<i>Forward, right 30. Watch your altitude.</i>

02:02:11.783 --> 02:02:12.942
<i>Roger.</i>

02:02:45.281 --> 02:02:47.247
<i>Hold.</i>
<i>I have a fouled cable. Fouled cable.</i>

02:02:47.314 --> 02:02:48.837
<i>Paying out slack.</i>

02:02:50.348 --> 02:02:53.178
Coast Guard helo,
this is Swimmer Number One!

02:02:53.248 --> 02:02:56.839
I'm in the engine room,
and the hold of the boat is filling up!

02:02:56.914 --> 02:02:58.903
- <i>He's trying to free the cable.</i>
- <i>Come on.</i>

02:03:03.947 --> 02:03:06.378
<i>Okay, cable free. Cable free.</i>

02:03:11.846 --> 02:03:12.937
<i>Attaboy.</i>

02:03:14.579 --> 02:03:16.943
<i>Cable's free,</i>
<i>and I got a fray right here.</i>

02:03:17.013 --> 02:03:19.877
<i>It's still good. It's still good.</i>
<i>I can use it. It's all we got.</i>

02:03:19.946 --> 02:03:20.934
<i>All right, good.</i>

02:03:21.013 --> 02:03:22.205
<i>Go back and left, Captain.</i>

02:03:22.279 --> 02:03:23.677
<i>Back and left. Roger that.</i>

02:03:29.079 --> 02:03:30.204
Jake.

02:03:43.911 --> 02:03:45.138
Come on.

02:03:45.311 --> 02:03:46.504
Come on.

02:03:48.878 --> 02:03:50.003
Jake!

02:03:55.544 --> 02:03:56.635
Jake!

02:03:59.544 --> 02:04:00.567
Jake?

02:04:00.644 --> 02:04:03.405
Senior? Senior, is that you?

02:04:03.576 --> 02:04:04.940
Goldfish!

02:04:05.077 --> 02:04:08.839
I checked all the locks on the door.
I can't get them loose. They're stuck.

02:04:08.910 --> 02:04:10.967
No, no, I see the problem.

02:04:11.977 --> 02:04:14.204
It's filling up, Senior Chief!

02:04:14.643 --> 02:04:17.404
Senior Chief! Get me out of here!

02:04:23.076 --> 02:04:25.473
I'm almost submerged!
You gotta get the door open!

02:04:25.542 --> 02:04:27.031
Hold on, Jake.

02:04:45.808 --> 02:04:47.932
Senior! The captain's body!

02:04:48.274 --> 02:04:50.433
We gotta let him go. Come on.

02:04:58.007 --> 02:04:59.495
Jake, he's gone!

02:05:09.139 --> 02:05:10.230
Jake!

02:05:12.739 --> 02:05:14.103
<i>I got both swimmers coming out.</i>

02:05:14.173 --> 02:05:16.764
- <i>Both swimmers are in sight.</i>
- <i>All right, I got them.</i>

02:05:34.738 --> 02:05:35.897
<i>Hook is going down.</i>

02:05:35.972 --> 02:05:39.233
<i>Let's go forward, right 40.</i>
<i>Hook is halfway down.</i>

02:05:39.371 --> 02:05:41.132
I'm hooking into you.

02:05:41.204 --> 02:05:43.500
We're only gonna get one shot at this.

02:05:46.404 --> 02:05:47.630
I'm in.

02:05:48.937 --> 02:05:50.130
I'm in!

02:06:04.036 --> 02:06:06.433
I thought you were going fishing.

02:06:06.503 --> 02:06:08.401
What do you call this?

02:06:13.902 --> 02:06:14.993
Whoa.

02:06:17.436 --> 02:06:21.163
<i>The cable's starting</i>
<i>to part! The cable! Hold, hold, hold!</i>

02:06:24.435 --> 02:06:26.560
<i>Okay, hold right there. Hold.</i>
<i>I'm bringing them up.</i>

02:06:26.635 --> 02:06:29.260
<i>I gotta jam this cable into the drum.</i>

02:06:36.801 --> 02:06:39.426
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

02:06:41.801 --> 02:06:43.733
Don't even think about it.

02:06:43.801 --> 02:06:45.926
It's not gonna hold us both.

02:06:46.133 --> 02:06:47.292
What...

02:06:47.634 --> 02:06:50.690
Yes, it will. Don't! lt'll hold!

02:06:54.334 --> 02:06:56.356
<i>Senior fell. Senior fell!</i>

02:06:58.700 --> 02:07:00.131
<i>Jake's got him. Jake's got him.</i>

02:07:00.199 --> 02:07:01.961
<i>I gotta get them up.</i>

02:07:23.532 --> 02:07:25.054
I won't let go!

02:07:27.298 --> 02:07:28.456
I know.

02:07:50.163 --> 02:07:51.652
Senior!

02:07:54.096 --> 02:07:55.494
Senior!

02:07:57.163 --> 02:07:58.651
Lower me down!

02:07:59.662 --> 02:08:01.151
Lower me down!

02:08:01.363 --> 02:08:03.954
<i>He just fell! He just fell!</i>
<i>Randall fell! Hit the water!</i>

02:08:04.029 --> 02:08:05.017
Lower me down!

02:08:05.096 --> 02:08:07.062
<i>He's in the water.</i>
<i>Been hit by a wave, full debris.</i>

02:08:07.128 --> 02:08:08.594
- Put me down!
- <i>I can't!</i>

02:08:08.662 --> 02:08:10.821
You gotta lower me down now!

02:08:13.062 --> 02:08:14.687
Get me out of here!

02:08:14.795 --> 02:08:17.159
- You gotta lower me down!
- <i>I can't!</i>

02:08:17.229 --> 02:08:18.217
I'll free-fall!

02:08:18.695 --> 02:08:22.821
<i>If I do, you don't come back.</i>
<i>I can't! I can't lose two!</i>

02:08:25.561 --> 02:08:27.356
<i>Lost swimmer. Lost swimmer.</i>

02:08:27.428 --> 02:08:30.326
<i>He saw the cable coming apart.</i>
<i>He just let go.</i>

02:08:31.027 --> 02:08:32.856
<i>He was about 80, 90 feet up, sir.</i>

02:08:32.927 --> 02:08:34.517
<i>He didn't come up. I don't see him.</i>

02:08:34.594 --> 02:08:36.617
<i>Flash landing hover lights.</i>

02:08:36.794 --> 02:08:38.090
<i>Monitor the radio, sir.</i>

02:08:38.161 --> 02:08:41.524
<i>Look for flares, strobes, anything.</i>
<i>He fell right in the debris.</i>

02:08:42.460 --> 02:08:45.324
<i>Lost swimmer. Lost swimmer.</i>

02:08:56.292 --> 02:08:57.622
<i>The Coast Guard conducted</i>

02:08:57.693 --> 02:08:59.488
<i>one of the largest</i>
<i>search-and-rescue missions</i>

02:08:59.559 --> 02:09:01.354
<i>for a single man in its history,</i>

02:09:03.326 --> 02:09:06.883
<i>but the body of Senior Chief</i>
<i>Ben Randall was never found.</i>

02:09:16.291 --> 02:09:17.917
I'm sorry, Helen.

02:09:19.225 --> 02:09:20.781
There's nothing more we can do.

02:09:21.924 --> 02:09:23.685
<i>What makes a legend?</i>

02:09:24.791 --> 02:09:26.984
<i>Is it what someone did</i>
<i>when they were alive...</i>

02:09:27.058 --> 02:09:29.024
Randall never was much
for this sort of thing.

02:09:29.091 --> 02:09:32.057
<i>or how they're remembered</i>
<i>after they're gone?</i>

02:09:34.157 --> 02:09:36.089
<i>Some people actually believe</i>

02:09:36.157 --> 02:09:39.453
<i>Senior Chief made the swim</i>
<i>to the Aleutian Islands.</i>

02:09:40.390 --> 02:09:43.220
<i>He's standing</i>
<i>on a distant beach somewhere</i>

02:09:43.324 --> 02:09:45.653
<i>with a fishing pole in his hand.</i>

02:09:48.790 --> 02:09:51.620
<i>But I found my answer</i>
<i>a couple weeks later.</i>

02:09:57.223 --> 02:09:58.586
Where is he?

02:10:01.922 --> 02:10:03.751
There's nobody else out there, man.

02:10:03.822 --> 02:10:05.412
No, he was there.

02:10:06.388 --> 02:10:08.616
He was with me the whole time.

02:10:08.789 --> 02:10:11.584
He said he would hold on
till help arrived.

02:10:12.689 --> 02:10:14.314
He never let go.

02:10:34.920 --> 02:10:38.545
<i>There's a legend of a man</i>
<i>who lives beneath the sea.</i>

02:10:41.019 --> 02:10:42.883
<i>He is a fisher of men,</i>

02:10:43.986 --> 02:10:47.316
<i>a last hope for all those</i>
<i>who have been left behind.</i>

02:10:50.919 --> 02:10:53.078
<i>He is known as the Guardian.</i>

02:10:56.053 --> 02:10:59.450
<i>Ben Randall always said</i>
<i>life is about making choices.</i>

02:10:59.985 --> 02:11:03.917
<i>In the end, by making his,</i>
<i>he helped me make mine.</i>

02:11:04.052 --> 02:11:05.518
What do you remember?

02:11:05.585 --> 02:11:07.176
What did you smell?
What did you see?

02:11:07.252 --> 02:11:09.081
How did this make you

02:11:13.918 --> 02:11:14.975
feel?

02:11:20.717 --> 02:11:22.343
I'll be right back.

02:11:26.951 --> 02:11:28.940
What are you doing here?

02:11:31.150 --> 02:11:32.639
I lied to you.

02:11:34.283 --> 02:11:35.873
I can't do casual.
