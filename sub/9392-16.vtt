FOX BROADCASTING COMPANYION,

00:31.032 --> 00:33.799
Brought to you by the
event, where you can drive away

00:33.801 --> 00:36.168
in any new 2012 VW
just your signature.

00:36.170 --> 00:38.203
Good evening, Quahog.
I'm Tom Tucker.

00:38.205 --> 00:39.204
Our top story tonight:

00:39.206 --> 00:40.773
In a shocking turn of events,

00:40.775 --> 00:43.042
the city of Detroit
has officially given up.

00:43.044 --> 00:46.011
The now former mayor has given
the key to the city

00:46.013 --> 00:47.546
back to the Huron Indian tribe.

00:47.548 --> 00:49.048
So, farewell, Detroit.

00:49.050 --> 00:53.018
From Bob Seger to Axel Foley,
we never really cared. Joyce?

00:53.020 --> 00:54.520
Thanks, Tom.
In local news,

00:54.522 --> 00:57.122
Quahog is expecting
a special guest this weekend,

00:57.124 --> 00:59.158
famed Asian
competitive eating champion

00:59.160 --> 01:01.026
Charles Yamamoto.

01:01.028 --> 01:03.662
Yamamoto has not yet lost
a hot dog eating competition

01:03.664 --> 01:05.030
on his world tour.

01:05.032 --> 01:06.999
But if you think
you have what it takes

01:07.001 --> 01:09.101
to beat the best eater
in the world,

01:09.103 --> 01:11.537
come down to the James Woods
High parking lot this Saturday

01:11.539 --> 01:13.505
with $50 and a large appetite.

01:13.507 --> 01:15.874
Wow, maybe you should
enter the contest, Dad.

01:15.876 --> 01:17.443
I'll bet
you could win.

01:17.445 --> 01:18.644
Well, I would, Chris,

01:18.646 --> 01:20.512
if I wasn't so
obsessed with my figure.

01:20.514 --> 01:21.780
Wait a minute.

01:21.782 --> 01:23.182
Chris, have <i>you</i> ever
eaten anything?

01:23.184 --> 01:24.850
Only, like, all the time!

01:24.852 --> 01:27.019
Perfect! Now we just
need the 50 bucks.

01:27.021 --> 01:29.922
Damn it, I knew I shouldn't
have named that star for Mort.

01:29.924 --> 01:32.424
Ugh! Just give me the money.

01:32.426 --> 01:33.625
Peter, we're not
spending $50

01:33.627 --> 01:35.794
so Chris can stuff his
face with hot dogs.

01:35.796 --> 01:37.096
All right, fine.

01:37.098 --> 01:39.164
I'll figure out a way
to get the cash myself.

01:39.166 --> 01:40.365
I'm a smart guy.

01:40.367 --> 01:42.134
Peter, no, you're not.

01:42.136 --> 01:45.170
Don't you feel ridiculous now?

01:48.141 --> 01:49.842
All right, Chris,
if we're gonna pay the entry fee

01:49.844 --> 01:51.043
for that eating contest,

01:51.045 --> 01:53.178
we got to sell some
of my old stuff.

01:53.180 --> 01:54.480
What are these, Dad?
Oh, wow.

01:54.482 --> 01:55.981
I haven't seen
those in a while.

01:55.983 --> 01:58.283
Those are my old <i>Playboys</i>
<i>from the '70s.</i>

01:58.285 --> 02:00.319
Oh, my God, this one's so hot.

02:00.321 --> 02:02.921
You can almost see
a little bit of woman.

02:02.923 --> 02:06.125
Wow, Peter, you've got some
pretty cool albums here.

02:06.127 --> 02:09.361
Yeah, well, I was one
cool potato back in the day.

02:09.363 --> 02:11.630
You know, some of these might
actually be worth something.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.532
Look at this--
Beatles, Rolling Stones.

02:13.534 --> 02:16.135
Oh, my God, I haven't seen
this one in forever.

02:16.137 --> 02:18.203
Look-Look at this. Queen,
<i>News of the World.</i>

02:18.205 --> 02:20.372
Check it out.

02:20.374 --> 02:21.507
Aah!

02:21.509 --> 02:22.774
Oh, what's the matter?

02:22.776 --> 02:25.010
What the hell is that?!
A killer robot monster?!

02:25.012 --> 02:26.278
No, it's <i>News of the World.</i>

02:26.280 --> 02:28.013
It's an album
by the band Queen. See?

02:28.015 --> 02:29.648
Aah!
Stewie, relax.

02:29.650 --> 02:32.117
No, Brian! You keep
that thing away from me!

02:32.119 --> 02:34.086
Is it... Is it looking at me?!

02:34.088 --> 02:35.921
Can it see me?!

02:35.923 --> 02:38.123
(laughing):
of this thing, huh?scared

02:38.125 --> 02:39.291
Does it eat little boys?!

02:39.293 --> 02:41.593
I don't know. Maybe,
if it's hungry.

02:41.595 --> 02:44.229
(yelling)

02:45.965 --> 02:48.300
Here's 50 bucks.
I'm taking this album.

02:48.302 --> 02:50.002
Oh, wow, check
it out, Chris!

02:50.004 --> 02:52.204
We got our entry fee
for the eating contest!

02:52.206 --> 02:53.505
Now for the
next five days,

02:53.507 --> 02:55.040
we're gonna focus on
nothing but training.

02:55.042 --> 02:57.242
We'll even get up at
the crack of dawn.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.812
(snoring)

03:00.814 --> 03:03.115
(whispering):
Dad?

03:03.117 --> 03:05.484
Dad, it's time to get up.

03:05.486 --> 03:08.954
Oh, jeez, Chris,
it's the crack of dawn.

03:08.956 --> 03:11.290
Yeah, but Dad, you
said to wake you up.

03:11.292 --> 03:13.158
Yeah... Yeah, but, uh...

03:13.160 --> 03:14.159
(mumbling)

03:14.161 --> 03:15.594
Just... get-get...
get in...

03:15.596 --> 03:17.930
get in the bed
with me and your mom.

03:17.932 --> 03:19.665
Okay, but what
about training?

03:19.667 --> 03:21.833
Oh, you smell
like melted cheese.

03:21.835 --> 03:25.270
Yummy, yummy, yummy,
yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy.

03:29.642 --> 03:32.211
(yawns) Good morning, Rupert.

03:32.213 --> 03:35.480
Please tell me you set the timer
on the coffeemaker

03:35.482 --> 03:37.249
because I completely forgot.

03:37.251 --> 03:38.617
(yelling)

03:38.619 --> 03:40.018
(laughing)

03:40.020 --> 03:41.587
You son of a bitch!

03:41.589 --> 03:44.089
Good morning.
Thought I'd help you wake up.

03:44.091 --> 03:46.091
God, why does he look sad?!

03:46.093 --> 03:47.693
He's already
destroyed mankind!

03:47.695 --> 03:49.394
What else could he want?!

03:51.164 --> 03:52.531
Hey, Carl.

03:52.533 --> 03:55.133
Hey, can I get a couple
of scratch-off lottery tickets?

03:55.135 --> 03:56.468
Oh, sure, Brian.

03:56.470 --> 03:59.037
Ooh, Brian, can I do one?
I love scratchers!

03:59.039 --> 04:00.672
Well, all right,
maybe just one.

04:01.808 --> 04:03.508
Cherry.

04:03.510 --> 04:04.710
Another cherry.

04:04.712 --> 04:07.079
Oh, come on, one more, one more!

04:08.047 --> 04:10.015
(yelling)

04:10.017 --> 04:11.316
Thanks, Carl.

04:11.318 --> 04:12.818
Yeah, you're welcome.
That was fun.

04:12.820 --> 04:14.253
See you later.

04:14.255 --> 04:16.989
Hey, uh, thanks
for letting me be Yoda.
Yup.

04:22.528 --> 04:24.263
What is this?

04:30.970 --> 04:34.473
("Pop Goes the Weasel" plays)

04:34.475 --> 04:35.140
(music stops)

04:35.142 --> 04:36.108
(music stops)

04:36.110 --> 04:37.609
(music resumes)

04:39.312 --> 04:41.680
(music stops)

04:41.682 --> 04:43.548
(music resumes)

04:45.251 --> 04:46.518
(music stops)

04:48.421 --> 04:49.621
(boing)

04:49.623 --> 04:52.357
Oh-ho-ho,
what was I worried about?

04:52.359 --> 04:54.192
Aah! Aah! Aah!
Oh, God!

04:54.194 --> 04:55.761
Aah! Aah!

04:55.763 --> 04:57.029
He's bleeding, man!

04:57.031 --> 04:59.798
He's bleeding, and nobody's
doing anything about it!

04:59.800 --> 05:02.167
I'll tell you what the news
of the world is.

05:02.169 --> 05:03.835
We're in a lot
of (bleep) trouble!

05:03.837 --> 05:05.904
(cheering and applause)

05:07.840 --> 05:09.107
All right, Chris,
this is it.

05:09.109 --> 05:10.876
This is what we've
been working for.

05:10.878 --> 05:13.011
If you get nervous, just
picture the audience naked

05:13.013 --> 05:14.813
and slide those hot
dogs down your throat.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.415
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome

05:16.417 --> 05:20.118
to the World Hot Dog Eating
Championship Competition!

05:20.120 --> 05:22.688
Please welcome our undefeated
champion eater,

05:22.690 --> 05:25.190
Charles Yamamoto!

05:25.192 --> 05:27.259
(cheering and applause)

05:29.529 --> 05:32.264
Oh, my God, that guy is huge.

05:33.199 --> 05:35.300
All right, eaters,
you have ten minutes.

05:35.302 --> 05:38.403
On your marks,
get set, eat!

05:48.614 --> 05:51.850
(cheering and whistling)

05:57.757 --> 05:59.024
Come on, Chris.
You're doing great.

05:59.026 --> 06:01.159
Just keep going.
You're almost there.

06:01.161 --> 06:03.161
Well, I'd better get a move on.

06:08.868 --> 06:10.102
Time's almost up!

06:10.104 --> 06:12.003
It's gonna be a close one!

06:14.874 --> 06:16.141
Chris, you're four
hot dogs behind!

06:16.143 --> 06:17.342
Come on! Hurry!

06:17.344 --> 06:20.512
Oh! I can't eat anymore.

06:20.514 --> 06:22.447
Remember what I told you.

06:22.449 --> 06:26.151
I get these weird cyst things
right on the fringe of my sac.

06:26.153 --> 06:27.919
I want to get 'em checked,

06:27.921 --> 06:29.921
but I'm afraid
of what they're gonna tell me.

06:29.923 --> 06:32.190
He's right. I <i>can</i> do it!

06:39.332 --> 06:40.532
(buzzer sounds, cheering)

06:40.534 --> 06:42.134
ANNOUNCER:
We have a winner!

06:42.136 --> 06:45.871
Ladies and gentlemen, Yamamoto
has finally been defeated!

06:45.873 --> 06:48.140
(cheering, applause
and whistling)

06:48.142 --> 06:50.342
Chris, you did it!
You're a champion!

06:50.344 --> 06:52.677
And now you get your
pick of the groupies.

06:54.414 --> 06:55.647
They're shiny.

06:55.649 --> 06:57.249
Yeah, it's a
pretty warm day.

07:01.087 --> 07:02.788
Oh!

07:02.790 --> 07:04.122
Hey, hey, hey,
there, champ!

07:04.124 --> 07:05.357
Aw, look at
him, Lois.

07:05.359 --> 07:06.958
Relaxing after
his big victory.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.460
Peter, he's not relaxing.

07:08.462 --> 07:10.262
He's in a great deal of pain.

07:10.264 --> 07:12.764
Damn it, don't you
see what you did to him?

07:12.766 --> 07:15.333
I told you not to take him
to that eating competition,

07:15.335 --> 07:16.835
and you deliberately defied me!

07:16.837 --> 07:18.637
All right, what's
this really about?

07:18.639 --> 07:20.806
Peter, Chris is
already overweight.

07:20.808 --> 07:23.842
We need to start taking
responsibility for his health.

07:23.844 --> 07:26.144
So I decided to sign him up
for fat camp.

07:26.146 --> 07:29.014
What?! Mom, I don't want
to go to fat camp!

07:29.016 --> 07:31.516
I'm sorry, sweetie.
It's for your own good.

07:31.518 --> 07:34.519
And trust me, you'll feel
much better about yourself.

07:34.521 --> 07:37.155
Everyone's gonna
make fun of me!

07:37.157 --> 07:39.291
Oh, come on, who's
gonna make fun of you?

07:39.293 --> 07:41.460
Hey, fatty, I hear
you're going to fat camp.

07:41.462 --> 07:42.694
That's where
you belong!

07:42.696 --> 07:44.029
Peter, stop it!

07:44.031 --> 07:46.531
And I'd better not see
you at the big dance!

07:46.533 --> 07:47.799
Come on, you.

07:47.801 --> 07:50.235
Sorry, Chris.
I-I'm gonna go with him.

08:11.457 --> 08:13.792
Hi. Welcome to
Camp Fresh Start.

08:13.794 --> 08:15.794
Yeah, our son's gross,
so here we are.

08:15.796 --> 08:17.095
The name's
Griffin.

08:17.097 --> 08:18.129
Ah, yes,
Chris Griffin.

08:18.131 --> 08:20.365
We have you staying
in the Broccoli Cabin.

08:20.367 --> 08:22.667
So you guys are just
gonna leave me here?

08:22.669 --> 08:24.603
Yeah, honey.
That's what camp is.

08:24.605 --> 08:26.204
I don't want to stay!

08:26.206 --> 08:28.006
Please take me home!

08:28.008 --> 08:30.141
I don't want to go to fat camp!

08:30.143 --> 08:32.110
Aw, come on, Chris.
Your mother's right.

08:32.112 --> 08:33.178
This'll be good for you.

08:33.180 --> 08:35.013
Well, how come you
don't have to go?!

08:35.015 --> 08:36.815
You're fatter
than I am!

08:36.817 --> 08:38.016
Huh. Good question, Peter.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.085
How come
you don't have to go?

08:40.087 --> 08:41.119
What are you
talking about?

08:41.121 --> 08:42.921
Well, you're the one
who entered him

08:42.923 --> 08:44.256
in that hot dog
eating contest.

08:44.258 --> 08:45.524
Besides, he's right.

08:45.526 --> 08:47.826
You    <i>cou</i>stand to lose
a few pounds yourself.

08:47.828 --> 08:49.794
Unless you don't think
you could handle it.

08:49.796 --> 08:51.530
Oh, yeah?

08:51.532 --> 08:52.797
Well, I think I can.

08:52.799 --> 08:54.032
What was that?

08:54.034 --> 08:55.634
Never you mind
what that was.

08:55.636 --> 08:57.769
(birds singing)

08:57.771 --> 08:59.104
(trash can lid clanging)

08:59.106 --> 09:01.006
Rise and shine, everyone!

09:02.041 --> 09:03.141
What do you got there?

09:03.143 --> 09:04.476
A candy bar, huh?

09:04.478 --> 09:05.844
Got any other
contraband?

09:05.846 --> 09:07.012
No.
Don't lie to me.

09:07.014 --> 09:08.580
My father was a lawyer.

09:08.582 --> 09:10.115
Oh, so your dad
gets guys off.

09:10.117 --> 09:11.316
(laughing)

09:11.318 --> 09:12.617
Peter Griffin.
Cabin clown.

09:12.619 --> 09:14.019
Where's your bag, fatty?

09:14.021 --> 09:16.021
You're welcome to
search my "beef case."

09:16.023 --> 09:17.989
But there's
"mutton"in there.

09:17.991 --> 09:20.091
(laughs)
Peter Griffin.
Cabin clown.

09:20.093 --> 09:21.760
You're in big trouble, mister.

09:21.762 --> 09:24.462
Oh, there's no pulling the
wool over this guy's eyes.

09:24.464 --> 09:26.798
Looks like I'd better
go on the "lamb."

09:26.800 --> 09:28.867
Peter Griffin.
Cabin clown.

09:31.504 --> 09:34.306
I think I'm gonna do okay here
at fat camp.

09:34.308 --> 09:36.508
You sure you got
the "chops"for it?

09:36.510 --> 09:38.343
Knock it off.
I'm the cabin clown.

09:38.345 --> 09:40.412
(owl hooting)

09:44.016 --> 09:46.084
And then he went
into the kitchen,

09:46.086 --> 09:49.854
slowly opened the refrigerator,
and it was empty!

09:49.856 --> 09:50.755
(all gasp)

09:50.757 --> 09:52.123
So then, the man,

09:52.125 --> 09:54.092
weak with hunger,
raced from the refrigerator

09:54.094 --> 09:56.628
to the counter
to look for a delivery menu,

09:56.630 --> 09:59.631
but all he could find was one
for a vegan place!

09:59.633 --> 10:01.333
(all yell)

10:01.335 --> 10:03.101
Vegan places aren't
real, right?

10:03.103 --> 10:06.137
No, they're not real.
Or are they?!

10:06.139 --> 10:07.339
Aah! Salad!

10:07.341 --> 10:09.507
(all yelling)

10:09.509 --> 10:11.042
Thank you
for sharing, Leonard.

10:11.044 --> 10:13.511
And I think getting a new couch
<i>was</i> the way to go.

10:13.513 --> 10:15.447
Is there someone else
who has a story

10:15.449 --> 10:16.815
they'd like to share? Peter?

10:16.817 --> 10:18.016
Uh, yeah, sure.

10:18.018 --> 10:19.985
This one time,
I was on a city bus,

10:19.987 --> 10:21.486
and the guy next to me

10:21.488 --> 10:23.254
was eating a bucket
of fried chicken.

10:23.256 --> 10:25.156
Mmm!
Ooh!
Yum!

10:25.158 --> 10:27.425
And the smell was
getting to me, you know.

10:27.427 --> 10:29.694
And even though
I didn't know the guy,

10:29.696 --> 10:31.196
I just dug in

10:31.198 --> 10:33.331
and started stuffing
that chicken into my mouth.

10:33.333 --> 10:34.633
O-Oh!
Embarrassing.

10:34.635 --> 10:35.934
I've done that.

10:35.936 --> 10:37.102
It was so delicious.

10:37.104 --> 10:40.005
But... it wasn't
fried chicken.

10:40.007 --> 10:42.173
It was a baby!

10:42.175 --> 10:44.943
(crying):
It was a baby.

10:44.945 --> 10:46.544
(sobbing)

10:50.983 --> 10:52.117
Stewie?

10:52.119 --> 10:55.086
Rupert, we won't give
that evil robot

10:55.088 --> 10:56.454
the satisfaction of killing us.

10:56.456 --> 10:59.290
We'll go together
on our own terms.

10:59.292 --> 11:01.459
See you on the other side.

11:01.461 --> 11:02.460
(gunshot)

11:02.462 --> 11:03.461
Oh, my God!

11:03.463 --> 11:04.863
Stewie, no!

11:04.865 --> 11:06.264
What the hell's
wrong with you?!

11:06.266 --> 11:07.666
It's that robot!

11:07.668 --> 11:10.101
He killed Queen,
and now he's going to kill me!

11:10.103 --> 11:11.202
He didn't kill Queen.

11:11.204 --> 11:12.437
They're all fine.

11:12.439 --> 11:14.105
Most of them are fine.

11:14.107 --> 11:16.141
Look, Stewie, I'm sorry
for scaring you, all right?

11:16.143 --> 11:18.276
But come on,
it's not a real robot.

11:18.278 --> 11:20.345
See? It, It's
just an album. Look.

11:20.347 --> 11:22.414
Here, you want
to hit it?

11:22.416 --> 11:24.983
Well... I'm usually more
comfortable around things

11:24.985 --> 11:27.018
if I can put them
in my mouth.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.154
So, can I put it
in my mouth?

11:29.156 --> 11:30.221
I guess.

11:31.691 --> 11:32.991
This is just an album!

11:32.993 --> 11:35.660
Yeah, that's what I've
been trying to tell you.

11:35.662 --> 11:37.629
So, you know,
can you forgive me?

11:37.631 --> 11:40.131
Oh, I suppose so.

11:40.133 --> 11:42.100
I mean, Magellan forgave
the "Land Ho" prankster.

11:42.102 --> 11:43.268
Land ho!

11:43.270 --> 11:44.436
Where?! Where?!

11:44.438 --> 11:45.870
Psych! Made you
look, loser.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.038
Good thing
there wasn't land

11:47.040 --> 11:49.174
or else you'd have
to meet the natives

11:49.176 --> 11:51.009
with that mustard stain
on your shirt.
What stain?

11:51.011 --> 11:52.077
Ah! (blows raspberry)

11:52.079 --> 11:54.312
Ugh! Why did I even bring
you on this trip?!

11:54.314 --> 11:55.947
Because I'm the best
damn land spotter

11:55.949 --> 11:57.148
in all of Europe.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.483
It's true.
You are the best.

11:58.485 --> 12:00.585
Yeah, I don't need you
to tell me that.

12:00.587 --> 12:02.754
(birds chirping)

12:02.756 --> 12:04.422
(both panting)

12:04.424 --> 12:06.424
Dad, I can't take
this anymore.

12:06.426 --> 12:10.528
I'm so tired
and I'm so hungry.

12:10.530 --> 12:12.597
I got an idea, Chris.
Follow me.

12:13.966 --> 12:15.133
What are we doing?

12:15.135 --> 12:17.435
I saw a forest like this
in a book one time,

12:17.437 --> 12:19.771
and I know there's
a gingerbread house
out here somewhere.

12:19.773 --> 12:21.106
Do you think
we could find it?!

12:21.108 --> 12:23.041
We have to, Chris.
We-we gotta eat something

12:23.043 --> 12:24.375
besides what
they're feeding us.

12:24.377 --> 12:25.977
I know what
you mean, Dad.

12:25.979 --> 12:28.980
I'm so hungry I could
eat this dead camper.

12:28.982 --> 12:30.115
Holy crap!

12:30.117 --> 12:32.250
(flies buzzing)

12:35.988 --> 12:38.523
Well, we clearly don't have
all the evidence yet,

12:38.525 --> 12:40.825
but that's never
stopped us before, right?

12:40.827 --> 12:42.160
(laughs)

12:44.196 --> 12:45.997
Oh, there's no other cops here.

12:45.999 --> 12:49.100
But we do know one thing,
this kid was murdered.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.168
(all gasp)

12:50.170 --> 12:51.603
Murdered?!
Who in the world

12:51.605 --> 12:53.004
would want to
kill a camper?

12:53.006 --> 12:54.372
Don't look at me.

12:54.374 --> 12:56.174
I'm just here to
drop off my son.

12:56.176 --> 13:00.578
Justin? Justin,
that does not work for me.

13:00.580 --> 13:02.480
And it looks like there
are signs of trauma

13:02.482 --> 13:03.982
around the throat.

13:03.984 --> 13:06.117
Somebody strangled
this fat kid.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.318
Wait. He was strangled?

13:07.320 --> 13:08.353
Yeah.

13:08.355 --> 13:09.921
Joe, I know
who did it.

13:09.923 --> 13:11.289
You do? Who?

13:11.291 --> 13:13.024
Well, there's
only one person I know

13:13.026 --> 13:14.959
who likes to strangle fat guys:

13:14.961 --> 13:16.661
Patrick Pewterschmidt.

13:16.663 --> 13:17.428
Who's that?

13:17.430 --> 13:19.597
My brother-in-law.

13:19.599 --> 13:22.934
<i>People call him</i>
<i>"The Fat Guy Strangler."</i>

13:22.936 --> 13:26.437
<i>He's always had a thing</i>
<i>for strangling fat guys.</i>

13:26.439 --> 13:29.040
I guess he fits
the profile, Peter,

13:29.042 --> 13:31.142
but Lois's brother is
locked up in an asylum.

13:31.144 --> 13:33.411
Well, either way,
we gotta get out of here.

13:33.413 --> 13:34.846
Otherwise,
we're just sitting ducks!

13:34.848 --> 13:37.682
Hey, we all know this guy
goes for the classy ladies.

13:37.684 --> 13:39.150
In fact, I once
caught him trying

13:39.152 --> 13:40.618
to pick up
a quack whore.

13:40.620 --> 13:42.954
(all laugh)

13:42.956 --> 13:44.088
All right, calm down.

13:44.090 --> 13:46.257
We all make bad choices.

13:48.127 --> 13:49.327
(phone rings)

13:49.329 --> 13:50.328
Hello?

13:50.330 --> 13:51.696
Lois, I hope
you're sitting down.

13:51.698 --> 13:53.031
I got something
to tell ya.

13:53.033 --> 13:54.132
Oh, God, what's wrong?

13:54.134 --> 13:56.134
Is everything okay?
Is it Chris?

13:56.136 --> 13:57.702
No, it's Peter,
your husband.

13:57.704 --> 13:59.270
But I'm calling
with big news.

13:59.272 --> 14:01.172
I was Anita in
the camp production

14:01.174 --> 14:02.473
of   <i>West Side Story.</i>

14:02.475 --> 14:05.143
Peter, you know you're terrible
at patter songs.

14:05.145 --> 14:06.644
I did okay.

14:06.646 --> 14:09.080

14:16.590 --> 14:18.923
One of the fat kids at camp
got strangled!

14:18.925 --> 14:20.425
(gasps) Oh, my God!

14:20.427 --> 14:22.260
Yeah, but don't worry.
It ain't your brother.

14:22.262 --> 14:23.828
He's still locked up
in that asylum.

14:23.830 --> 14:26.030
Um, Mom...

14:26.032 --> 14:28.099
look who dropped
by for a visit.

14:29.301 --> 14:31.302
Hello, Lois.

14:31.304 --> 14:32.637

14:32.639 --> 14:34.038
It's been
a long time.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.207
(hushed):
Peter, he's here!

14:36.209 --> 14:38.176
Wait a second, Lois,
I want to go back

14:38.178 --> 14:40.011
to what you said
about my patter singing.

14:40.013 --> 14:41.346
Who gives you
the right?!

14:41.348 --> 14:42.914
You know I carried
Pirates of Penzance

anyone else!

15:05.138 --> 15:07.272
If he even lays
a finger on my family,

15:07.274 --> 15:09.707
I'll do to him
what I did to the Riddler.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.152

15:21.154 --> 15:22.754

15:22.756 --> 15:24.088
Oh, Peter, thank God!

15:24.090 --> 15:26.124
Patrick Pewterschmidt,
you're under arrest

15:26.126 --> 15:29.127
for the murder of, uh...
(bleep)

15:29.129 --> 15:31.095
I didn't get
the kid's name.

15:31.097 --> 15:32.530
We're supposed to do that.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.032
Lois, you called
the cops?

15:34.034 --> 15:38.136
Patrick, you're my brother and
I love you, but you're not well.

15:38.138 --> 15:39.003
But I'm better now.

15:39.005 --> 15:40.505
I've put my past
behind me.

15:40.507 --> 15:41.839
Save it, Patrick.

15:41.841 --> 15:44.575
We know you escaped
from the asylum and killed...

15:44.577 --> 15:46.311
Bill, we'll just call him
"Bill" for now.

15:46.313 --> 15:48.146
Escaped?
I-I didn't escape.

15:48.148 --> 15:50.748
Just this morning, a very nice
gentleman opened my cell door

15:50.750 --> 15:52.450
and said I was
free to go.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.953
Yeah, nice try.
That's not how it works.

15:54.955 --> 15:57.989
Uncle Patrick, why do you
strangle fat people?

15:57.991 --> 15:59.324
It's probably
a weird fetish thing.

15:59.326 --> 16:00.959
Some criminals have 'em.

16:00.961 --> 16:02.694
Like those anal-retentive
bandits

16:02.696 --> 16:04.262
who robbed Quahog Bank
last year.

16:04.264 --> 16:06.931
All right, hands in the air!
Vertically!

16:06.933 --> 16:08.833
Both arms should be
parallel to each other!

16:08.835 --> 16:11.202
You, fill this bag with clean,
unmarked bills!

16:11.204 --> 16:14.305
But first fix that notepad
so it's at a right angle

16:14.307 --> 16:15.773
with the corner of your desk!

16:15.775 --> 16:18.109
And tap that pile
of receipts against
a flat surface

16:18.111 --> 16:19.410
so they're not sticking out
haphazardly!

16:19.412 --> 16:20.945
You know what?!
Forget about the money!

16:20.947 --> 16:21.980
Everybody grab a broom!

16:21.982 --> 16:23.247
We are straightening
this place up!

16:26.618 --> 16:27.652
All right, campers,

16:27.654 --> 16:29.354
until the Fat Guy Strangler
is caught,

16:29.356 --> 16:31.856
everyone has to stay
inside their cabins.

16:31.858 --> 16:33.458
Now I'm gonna do
a stomach count.

16:33.460 --> 16:35.193
When I call your name,
please respond.

16:35.195 --> 16:36.260
Jenkins?

16:36.262 --> 16:37.261
(stomach growls)

16:37.263 --> 16:38.262
Robertson?

16:38.264 --> 16:39.263
(stomach growls)

16:39.265 --> 16:40.264
Davis?

16:40.266 --> 16:42.133
(stomach growls)
Elliot?

16:42.135 --> 16:43.201
Where's Elliot?

16:43.203 --> 16:44.469
I think he's asleep.

16:44.471 --> 16:47.005
Elliot?
Elliot, wake up.

16:47.007 --> 16:49.507
Elliot? (gasps)

16:49.509 --> 16:51.142
(phone rings)

16:51.144 --> 16:52.410
Officer Swanson here.

16:52.412 --> 16:54.312
What?! Oh, my God!

16:54.314 --> 16:56.147
What is it, Joe?

16:56.149 --> 16:58.082
Another camper was strangled
half an hour ago.

16:58.084 --> 17:00.351
But... that means...

17:00.353 --> 17:02.620
Patrick can't be
the killer.

17:02.622 --> 17:04.655
That's what I was
trying to tell you.

17:04.657 --> 17:06.090
Acknowledged. I'm on it.

17:06.092 --> 17:08.092
Joe, would you settle
a camp argument?

17:08.094 --> 17:10.128
Is it "Bombardment"
or "Dodgeball"?

17:10.130 --> 17:10.828
Dodgeball.

17:10.830 --> 17:11.929
Ah, you don't know.

17:11.931 --> 17:13.531
Well, I'd better
put out an APB

17:13.533 --> 17:15.133
to all
the neighboring towns.

17:15.135 --> 17:16.968
Oh, the murderer won't leave
the camp.

17:16.970 --> 17:19.103
What?
What are you talking about?

17:19.105 --> 17:20.271
He's "feeding."

17:20.273 --> 17:22.340
He killed twice and
he's gonna do it again.

17:22.342 --> 17:25.143
He's got plenty of places
to hide out there

17:25.145 --> 17:26.744
and a fully stocked corral
of victims.

17:26.746 --> 17:28.012
How do you know that?

17:28.014 --> 17:29.981
Trust me. I know.

17:29.983 --> 17:31.983
You know, Joe,
maybe Patrick can
actually be of help.

17:31.985 --> 17:34.519
I mean, who better
to get inside the
mind of someone

17:34.521 --> 17:37.088
who's strangling fat
people than someone
who's done it himself?

17:37.090 --> 17:38.289
Yeah, give him a chance, Joe.

17:38.291 --> 17:40.158
Like I did with scary teenagers.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.460
I used to be afraid of 'em,
until I realized

17:42.462 --> 17:43.828
they were just misunderstood.

17:43.830 --> 17:45.530
Hey, fat ass,
give me your wallet!

17:45.532 --> 17:46.998
I  <i>could</i>give you
my wallet,

17:47.000 --> 17:49.434
but what I think
you really want...

17:49.436 --> 17:50.802
is love.

17:50.804 --> 17:52.603
(voice breaks):
It's true!

17:57.810 --> 17:59.143
I'm taking your shoes.

18:05.984 --> 18:07.018
Poor kid.

18:07.020 --> 18:08.519
You know,
the weirdest thing is

18:08.521 --> 18:09.987
his bunk is right next
to Chris's.

18:09.989 --> 18:11.522
Yeah, that was
a close call.

18:11.524 --> 18:13.591
Oh, it was more
than a close call.

18:13.593 --> 18:16.260
You said the first victim was
wearing a baseball cap,

18:16.262 --> 18:17.695
this second one is blond...

18:17.697 --> 18:20.198
The killer wasn't trying
to murder <i>this</i> kid.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.200
He was trying to murder Chris.

18:22.202 --> 18:23.534
(gasps) Oh, my God!

18:23.536 --> 18:25.770
W-Why would anyone
want to kill Chris?

18:25.772 --> 18:27.105
I don't know,
but I do know

18:27.107 --> 18:29.340
that he's in a great deal
of danger right now.

18:29.342 --> 18:30.975
Come on. Let's go!
Yeah!

18:30.977 --> 18:33.945
But wait, this is our last
chance to do a panty raid!

18:33.947 --> 18:35.179
(women scream)

18:35.181 --> 18:36.981
Yay! Fat camp!
We got it!

18:36.983 --> 18:39.050
Oh, no, a gust of wind!

18:45.157 --> 18:47.225
(rustling)

18:51.763 --> 18:54.165
(creaking)

18:55.367 --> 18:58.136
(gasps) Wha, what
are you doing here?

18:58.138 --> 19:00.004
You dishonored me,
Chris Griffin.

19:00.006 --> 19:02.974
No one has ever eaten
more hot dogs than me.

19:02.976 --> 19:04.909
Now you must die!

19:07.012 --> 19:09.814
(gagging)
(glass shattering)

19:13.685 --> 19:15.186
(groans)

19:15.821 --> 19:17.155
(gasps)

19:21.693 --> 19:23.895
(gagging)

19:33.172 --> 19:34.539
STEWIE: Hey, fat ass!

19:35.807 --> 19:37.408
I got news for you.

19:37.410 --> 19:40.611
The <i>News of the World!</i>

19:40.613 --> 19:41.779
(screams)

19:41.781 --> 19:43.915
Why does robot hold
dead people?!

19:43.917 --> 19:45.616
Is that future or past?!

19:45.618 --> 19:47.685
(gasping and groaning)

19:51.156 --> 19:54.425
Oh, my God, Stewie,
you saved my life!

19:54.427 --> 19:56.360
Ah, you would've done
the same for me, Chris.

19:56.362 --> 19:58.863
The important thing is,
we're all gonna be okay.

19:58.865 --> 20:00.231
Right, Giant Robot?

20:10.175 --> 20:14.445
Charles Yamamoto...
went from eating champion

20:14.447 --> 20:15.913
to cold-blooded killer.

20:15.915 --> 20:17.114
Who'd have thought?

20:17.116 --> 20:19.016
Wait a minute, Joe.
That's the guy who opened

20:19.018 --> 20:20.918
the door to my cell
yesterday and told me

20:20.920 --> 20:22.153
I could leave
the asylum.

20:22.155 --> 20:23.654
Huh. Is that right?

20:23.656 --> 20:25.122
Well, then it
all makes sense.

20:25.124 --> 20:26.457
Yamamoto wanted it
to look like

20:26.459 --> 20:28.426
you broke out
on your own.

20:28.428 --> 20:29.860
That way,
when he murdered Chris,

20:29.862 --> 20:32.630
it was a cinch
that you would
take the blame.

20:32.632 --> 20:36.634
Well, Patrick, I guess
we all owe you an apology.

20:36.636 --> 20:37.702
Patrick?

20:37.704 --> 20:39.537
Where did he go?

20:39.539 --> 20:41.072
He was just
right here.

20:41.074 --> 20:42.240
What happened?!

20:43.475 --> 20:45.142
Damn it!
He must've gotten away!

20:45.144 --> 20:46.310
How is that possible?!

20:46.312 --> 20:48.246
I don't know,
but I'd better make it

20:48.248 --> 20:49.914
look like there
was a struggle.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.315
Someone punch me
in the face.

20:52.284 --> 20:54.051
I'm a good friend
to you.

20:57.456 --> 21:01.525
