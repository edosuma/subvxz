01:52.160 --> 01:53.840
Mr. Shikijoh...

01:53.840 --> 01:56.560
Do you think he’ll really come here?

01:56.560 --> 01:58.370
He will.

01:58.370 --> 02:00.640
His go-to lady works here.

02:00.640 --> 02:03.220
And I know he has an appointment tonight.

02:03.590 --> 02:07.520
I don’t know. He’s been really good at watching his back.

02:10.229 --> 02:11.400
He’s here!

02:11.400 --> 02:13.160
Holy shit...

02:13.160 --> 02:15.030
Every guy thinks with his dick.

02:15.030 --> 02:16.220
Okay...

02:16.960 --> 02:18.370
Let’s go in!

02:18.370 --> 02:19.130
Yes, sir!

02:20.650 --> 02:24.720
Unbelievable! You’re human trash!

02:26.950 --> 02:29.180
Does that make you happy?

02:29.180 --> 02:31.140
Shake your butt harder!

02:32.310 --> 02:34.150
There!

02:34.150 --> 02:36.120
Like that?

02:36.880 --> 02:38.840
Do you want more?

02:38.840 --> 02:40.800
Is this good?

02:44.240 --> 02:45.220
Stop right there!

02:46.070 --> 02:47.730
And who might you be?

02:47.730 --> 02:49.770
I’m with the MPD, Criminal Investigation Division.

02:49.770 --> 02:51.900
I saw a serial bomber walk in here.

02:53.400 --> 02:55.730
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

02:55.730 --> 02:57.530
Don’t try to hide him...

02:58.800 --> 03:00.110
...or you’ll have to answer to the law.

03:01.250 --> 03:03.620
You barged in here and disrupted my business!

03:03.620 --> 03:05.230
Who do you think you are?!

03:23.670 --> 03:25.680
What are you...gonna do to me?

03:28.380 --> 03:29.330
Mr. Shikijoh!

03:29.330 --> 03:31.160
Stay out of this!

03:31.160 --> 03:32.470
You better watch it.

03:32.470 --> 03:36.930
That’s Shikijoh Hario, the demon of the CID you’re messing with. You’re gonna pay—

03:36.930 --> 03:38.340
Shut it!

03:39.290 --> 03:41.030
This is me we’re talking about.

03:41.030 --> 03:45.070
I’m not gonna be like this forever against a mere dominatrix.

03:45.070 --> 03:47.410
Oh? Then maybe you’ll like this!

03:49.640 --> 03:54.000
Most men fall for me after experiencing my whip!

03:54.000 --> 03:55.960
Impossible!

03:55.960 --> 03:58.350
He’s extremely straitlaced!

03:58.350 --> 04:00.720
A demon with no interest in women!

04:01.480 --> 04:04.800
No way he’d fall for a woman like you—

04:06.150 --> 04:07.320
Stop right now!

04:07.320 --> 04:08.940
No way am I stopping!

04:08.940 --> 04:11.850
This is for disrupting my business!

04:11.850 --> 04:14.260
That was an order!

04:16.279 --> 04:18.779
Pointing a gun at a lady with a whip?

04:18.779 --> 04:20.940
You guys have stooped as low as you possibly can...

04:20.940 --> 04:22.570
This is your final warning!

04:22.570 --> 04:23.970
Stop.

04:23.970 --> 04:24.780
Don’t shoot.

04:24.780 --> 04:26.070
But Mr. Shikijoh...

04:29.780 --> 04:30.830
Why?

04:30.830 --> 04:33.800
This is obviously an obstruction of justice!

04:33.800 --> 04:34.820
I’ll shoot.

04:34.820 --> 04:35.540
No!

04:35.540 --> 04:36.540
Why?

04:38.000 --> 04:40.380
This actually isn’t...

04:40.380 --> 04:41.420
Huh?

04:44.590 --> 04:48.280
This actually isn’t...

04:57.440 --> 04:59.900
Isn't so bad. More! Give me more!

05:01.360 --> 05:05.660
That’s how my parents met.

05:06.840 --> 05:12.810
Three years after I was born, my dad was shot by a criminal and died on duty.

05:14.270 --> 05:16.740
There were bullet wounds all over his body.

05:16.740 --> 05:18.560
His last words, you ask?

05:18.560 --> 05:21.520
“This actually isn’t...” or so the story goes.

05:22.320 --> 05:23.710
As for my mom?

05:25.000 --> 05:26.380
Ow!

05:26.380 --> 05:31.180
How many times do I have to tell you to eat the egg white too?

05:32.640 --> 05:34.240
She still works.

05:34.240 --> 05:38.280
I have the late shift tonight, so go eat out tonight, okay?

05:38.280 --> 05:39.880
Okay.

05:39.880 --> 05:41.400
But if you ask me...

05:41.400 --> 05:46.150
...why don’t you smooth talk some girl into eating out with you ?

05:46.150 --> 05:50.330
Why are you so needlessly huge and unattractive?

05:50.330 --> 05:54.800
What is my, <i>my</i> DNA doing inside a body that looks like this?

05:54.800 --> 05:56.710
I don’t have time for girls with school and club activities.

05:56.710 --> 05:59.460
What are you? A goody two-shoes?

06:02.910 --> 06:04.660
You’re so gross!

06:07.130 --> 06:08.650
What is wrong with you?

06:08.650 --> 06:09.890
You stink!

06:09.890 --> 06:10.730
So bad!

06:10.730 --> 06:12.430
So bad!

06:12.430 --> 06:14.600
Hey! What are you doing?

06:14.600 --> 06:15.100
Stop right there!

06:16.380 --> 06:20.130
Huh? Who do you think you are?

06:20.130 --> 06:24.780
In contrast, I do seem to take after my dad and have his strong sense of justice.

06:24.780 --> 06:26.110
Why don’t you pick on someone your own size?

06:26.880 --> 06:28.590
Bring it on!

06:28.590 --> 06:30.500
However...

06:31.490 --> 06:32.120
Let’s go!

06:36.350 --> 06:38.240
And scene!

06:38.240 --> 06:39.080
I’m weak.

06:39.580 --> 06:41.470
Don’t mess with us again!

06:48.480 --> 06:49.460
You did it again?

06:51.340 --> 06:52.010
Yeah.

06:52.580 --> 06:57.800
You know, you have a bit of a scary face, so you should be careful.

06:57.800 --> 07:01.540
Your default expression looks like you’re saying, “you gotta problem?”

07:01.540 --> 07:02.440
You don’t have to tell me.

07:03.410 --> 07:07.600
But that disconnect is what makes you likable.

07:07.600 --> 07:11.760
You look so strong, yet...you’re so weak.

07:11.760 --> 07:12.810
Shut up.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.290
Everyone, to your seat!

07:17.290 --> 07:19.740
You too! Get to your seat!

07:19.740 --> 07:20.910
Oh, sorry.

07:23.090 --> 07:26.950
Everyone, I’d like to introduce our new student to you.

07:26.950 --> 07:30.270
Please welcome, Himeno Aiko, who’s come from Kobe.

07:30.270 --> 07:32.080
Hi. I’m Himeno Aiko.

07:32.080 --> 07:33.090
It’s nice to meet everyone.

07:34.020 --> 07:35.100
She’s so cute.

07:36.280 --> 07:38.200
I heard that.

07:38.200 --> 07:38.820
Hm?

07:38.820 --> 07:40.500
You were thinking out loud.

07:40.500 --> 07:41.110
Really?

07:41.110 --> 07:43.870
How about you sit next to Shikijoh?

07:43.870 --> 07:45.240
Okay?

07:45.240 --> 07:48.680
The guy in the back who looks like an oaf.

07:48.680 --> 07:49.830
Oh, okay!

07:49.830 --> 07:51.490
How did she know it was me?

07:51.490 --> 07:53.430
All right, let’s get started.

07:55.210 --> 07:56.720
Everyone, turn to page 85.

07:58.120 --> 07:59.600
Ikeda, read please.

08:02.840 --> 08:05.220
What’s wrong with your face?

08:06.280 --> 08:08.140
I was born looking like an oaf.

08:08.140 --> 08:10.430
No, I mean the blood.

08:11.150 --> 08:11.960
Oh!

08:12.570 --> 08:16.400
It’s uh...it’s nothing.

08:17.300 --> 08:20.390
Um, if you’d like, use this.

08:21.330 --> 08:22.190
Really? 

08:25.330 --> 08:27.190
Insect Repellant 

08:28.720 --> 08:30.050
So cute...

08:34.299 --> 08:35.740
Let’s see what you’ve got, Kyosuke!

08:36.620 --> 08:40.510
To knock someone out, strike their gut.

08:40.510 --> 08:41.080
Okay.

08:42.360 --> 08:45.950
I joined the martial arts club in hopes of becoming a little more rugged.

08:45.950 --> 08:51.520
Even if it’s just a little bit, I hope that it brings me closer to the strongest man I’ve known, my dad.

08:52.060 --> 08:52.970
However...

08:57.180 --> 08:58.430
That’s the match!

08:58.430 --> 09:01.310
I’m showing no signs of improvement.

09:03.450 --> 09:04.580
Hey guys!

09:05.710 --> 09:09.270
Aiko here just transfered in, and she’s interested in being the manager of our club.

09:10.610 --> 09:12.150
She’s more than welcome!

09:21.990 --> 09:22.830
Kyosuke!

09:23.280 --> 09:25.360
Hey, ’sup?

09:25.360 --> 09:27.210
Kyosuke, she’s in your class, right?

09:27.660 --> 09:28.540
Yes.

09:29.190 --> 09:30.840
What a coincidence.

09:30.840 --> 09:31.920
It’s a pleasure to be here.

09:32.870 --> 09:34.800
The pleasure’s all mine.

09:34.800 --> 09:38.010
Why does it feel like fireworks are going off in my chest?

09:39.470 --> 09:43.970
{\fad(443,95)}Why don’t you smooth talk some girl into eating out with you sometime?

09:43.970 --> 09:47.130
That’s right... I should take her out to dinner.

09:47.130 --> 09:54.510
But would she think I’m a player if I took her out on her first day here?

09:54.510 --> 10:00.320
Should I just listen to my heart and tell her straight up?

10:00.320 --> 10:02.540
Okay, let’s ask her out.

10:03.650 --> 10:10.280
Wait, what if she’s interested in the kind of guys who have no interest in women?

10:10.280 --> 10:10.750
What are you gonna do?

10:11.970 --> 10:14.350
What are you gonna do, Kyosuke?

10:14.350 --> 10:16.300
Well, I’m going to go home today.

10:16.300 --> 10:17.920
Have a nice day!

10:17.920 --> 10:19.930
I’m looking forward to starting tomorrow.

10:20.530 --> 10:22.560
It was great meeting you.

10:29.160 --> 10:30.590
Don’t worry.

10:30.590 --> 10:32.370
Time’s on your side.

10:32.370 --> 10:34.420
You did the right thing.

10:35.810 --> 10:37.410
Oh, man...

10:37.410 --> 10:40.050
I guess I’m eating out alone again.

10:50.140 --> 10:52.030
Excuse me, is something happening?

10:52.030 --> 10:54.780
There’s a hostage situation!

10:54.780 --> 10:55.630
Hostage?

10:55.630 --> 10:56.280
Yeah.

10:57.050 --> 11:01.350
There’s a robbery in progress at Cosmo Loans, a money loaning company. It’s already been reported.

11:01.350 --> 11:04.580
It seems that they have a group of four or five people being held hostage.

11:04.580 --> 11:09.120
Among them are several employees of the company and a high school girl who was passing by.

11:09.120 --> 11:10.130
Yes.

11:10.130 --> 11:11.400
Aiko?

11:11.400 --> 11:14.940
Hey, what’re the police doing?

11:14.940 --> 11:17.650
Hurry up and get a helicopter ready!

11:17.650 --> 11:19.620
Hey, you asshole!

11:19.620 --> 11:20.910
Let her go!

11:20.910 --> 11:22.520
Kyosuke!

11:22.520 --> 11:24.080
Hey, stop!

11:24.080 --> 11:25.720
Don’t agitate them!

11:25.720 --> 11:27.750
Who are you?

11:28.210 --> 11:29.540
I’m her boyfriend!

11:29.540 --> 11:31.470
Her boyfriend?

11:31.470 --> 11:33.540
What? No, he’s not.

11:33.540 --> 11:35.500
He’s not your boyfriend?

11:35.940 --> 11:36.880
We’re dating.

11:36.880 --> 11:39.590
We’re not dating. We just met today.

11:39.590 --> 11:40.520
We’re dating.

11:40.520 --> 11:41.530
We’re not!

11:41.530 --> 11:42.300
We’re dating!

11:42.300 --> 11:43.210
We’re not!

11:43.210 --> 11:45.520
I don’t care!

11:45.520 --> 11:47.460
Hey, buddy!

11:47.460 --> 11:50.810
If the police don’t call a helicopter for us, your girlfriend’s gonna die!

11:52.140 --> 11:54.430
Excuse me! Can you hurry it up with the helicopter?

11:54.430 --> 11:55.900
Look around!

11:55.900 --> 11:58.160
You can’t land a helicopter anywhere.

11:58.160 --> 12:00.740
Then why are they demanding a helicopter?

12:00.740 --> 12:01.990
They’re idiots.

12:01.990 --> 12:03.510
They’re idiots?

12:04.340 --> 12:05.660
God damn it.

12:33.880 --> 12:35.400
Hey, dude!

12:35.400 --> 12:36.920
Go check around the building.

12:36.920 --> 12:37.950
Yes, sir.

12:40.150 --> 12:43.030
Hey, where’s the helicopter?

12:43.030 --> 12:44.910
I’m sorry, boss.

12:44.910 --> 12:46.790
I think it’ll be here soon.

12:47.540 --> 12:49.320
Oh, man!

12:49.320 --> 12:54.670
If you would have just given us the money instead of calling the cops, this wouldn’t have happened!

12:55.300 --> 12:58.440
You’re so stupid, Mr. Manager.

13:02.920 --> 13:04.210
Listen up!

13:05.000 --> 13:09.220
I can’t wait forever, so I’m going to kill someone every 30 minutes.

13:13.870 --> 13:15.320
This is 911.

13:15.320 --> 13:18.620
We’re going to kill one off every 30 minutes!

13:18.620 --> 13:21.150
Hurry up with the damn helicopter!

13:24.960 --> 13:26.610
I told them.

13:26.610 --> 13:28.980
I guess we’ll start with...

13:28.980 --> 13:31.490
...the little girl.

13:41.870 --> 13:43.290
Now...

13:43.290 --> 13:45.300
How do I sneak into the office?

13:47.640 --> 13:50.440
Oh...a weapon would be nice.

14:02.040 --> 14:03.640
Who are you?

14:03.640 --> 14:04.800
Gut punch!

14:09.600 --> 14:13.680
Hell yeah! My training is starting to pay off!

14:15.930 --> 14:17.120
I know!

14:17.720 --> 14:20.630
I’ll steal his clothes and pretend to be him.

14:30.350 --> 14:31.690
All right.

14:31.690 --> 14:33.640
I’m coming, Aiko.

14:35.100 --> 14:38.310
Oh, forgot the mask.

14:38.680 --> 14:40.210
The mask.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.030
Here it is.

14:44.490 --> 14:45.560
Okay.

14:49.610 --> 14:50.600
Huh?

14:52.700 --> 14:54.790
This isn’t a mask.

14:56.280 --> 15:00.420
Is this...a pair of panties?

15:01.610 --> 15:05.210
They’ll think I’m a total pervert if I walk in there with this on my head.

15:05.210 --> 15:06.940
I need to wear the real mask.

15:08.660 --> 15:09.610
But...

15:12.210 --> 15:17.530
But why does it feel so perfect on my skin?

15:19.360 --> 15:22.350
No, I must take this off!

15:22.350 --> 15:26.070
But this intensifying feeling of excitement—I can’t hold it in!

15:28.950 --> 15:30.640
No!

15:30.640 --> 15:34.090
I can’t let Aiko see me like this.

15:36.760 --> 15:37.800
What?

15:38.700 --> 15:42.470
It feels like it’s become a part of my face!

15:43.230 --> 15:44.360
What is this?

15:45.510 --> 15:48.880
What is this pool of magma I feel welling inside me?

15:49.680 --> 15:54.470
The raging magma that melts away all sense of guilt!

15:56.190 --> 15:58.190
I can’t...

15:58.920 --> 16:00.770
I’m losing...

16:02.910 --> 16:06.040
I’m losing myself.

16:09.900 --> 16:11.860
I’m in a state of ecstasy!

16:12.770 --> 16:17.640
Normally, a person can only use 30% of their maximum potential.

16:17.640 --> 16:22.480
However, by wearing panties, the DNA of Kyosuke’s mother has awakened within him,

16:22.480 --> 16:26.020
and he is able to use his maximum potential.

16:30.360 --> 16:32.870
Out with clothes!

16:36.910 --> 16:39.470
I have no need for clothes.

16:50.560 --> 16:54.420
Well...it’s almost been 30 minutes.

16:54.420 --> 16:59.890
Like I said earlier, you’re first in line to die.

16:59.890 --> 17:01.200
No...

17:01.200 --> 17:02.690
Someone...

17:03.790 --> 17:05.420
Someone save me!

17:06.690 --> 17:07.690
Who’s that?

17:07.690 --> 17:10.250
Hey, that better not be the police.

17:12.630 --> 17:14.560
It’s Kyosuke.

17:14.560 --> 17:17.220
He must have come to save me.

17:17.220 --> 17:18.430
Who’s there?

17:22.980 --> 17:25.720
He’s wearing a mask.

17:25.720 --> 17:27.200
Is he the guy you sent to—

17:27.200 --> 17:28.109
No!

17:28.109 --> 17:30.960
Who the fuck are you?

17:35.240 --> 17:39.650
I’ve come to teach evil doers like you a lesson.

17:40.880 --> 17:42.540
I'm The Masked Pervert!

17:45.330 --> 17:46.730
The Masked Pervert?

17:47.340 --> 17:49.170
Holy shit...

17:49.170 --> 17:51.960
He’s wearing panties on his face.

17:53.950 --> 17:56.750
He’s wearing panties on his face!

18:00.440 --> 18:04.750
Now...hand her over.

18:05.460 --> 18:05.810
No...

18:06.360 --> 18:08.710
...he’s a different kind...

18:08.710 --> 18:09.870
...of scary.

18:09.870 --> 18:13.440
Don’t get any closer, Mr. Pervert!

18:13.440 --> 18:16.350
Girl, come over here.

18:16.350 --> 18:18.570
No, you’re scary!

18:18.570 --> 18:21.450
I was serious!

18:29.710 --> 18:31.080
What the fuck?

18:38.380 --> 18:39.490
Okay, I get it!

18:39.490 --> 18:41.060
Hey, go over there!

18:46.080 --> 18:48.070
Hey, wait! Come back here!

18:48.070 --> 18:49.640
I got your back!

18:53.000 --> 18:54.230
The Masked Pervert...

18:55.170 --> 18:57.070
You sure gave us a hard time.

18:57.070 --> 18:58.600
Now you can’t move.

18:58.600 --> 19:01.780
Why don’t you and that girl hold hands as you walk into hell?

19:10.250 --> 19:12.160
The Masked Pervert...

19:12.160 --> 19:15.590
...power up!

19:24.350 --> 19:25.640
What?

19:26.480 --> 19:28.100
Here I come.

19:28.100 --> 19:35.070
The Masked Pervert is able to draw out more power by applying pressure to his crotch.

19:51.370 --> 19:53.470
Take my ultimate move.

19:54.530 --> 19:57.750
Golden Power Bomb!

20:20.190 --> 20:21.910
The Masked Pervert...

20:22.560 --> 20:24.700
You’re such a pervert...

20:24.700 --> 20:28.820
You’re such a pervert, but...you’re so cool!

20:30.640 --> 20:31.530
Justice is served.

20:33.090 --> 20:35.140
Everyone, get away.

20:48.840 --> 20:50.870
Are you okay, Miss?

20:58.330 --> 21:00.240
Hands where I can see them!

21:02.860 --> 21:04.490
Who are you?

21:04.490 --> 21:05.700
Oh, no.

21:05.700 --> 21:06.520
Time to leave.

21:14.790 --> 21:16.480
Are you okay, Aiko?

21:17.130 --> 21:20.170
Yeah, a superhero saved me.

21:20.800 --> 21:22.510
A superhero?

21:24.130 --> 21:27.860
I wish I could have been there for you.

21:27.860 --> 21:28.920
No.

21:28.920 --> 21:31.240
Everyone had guns.

21:31.240 --> 21:33.760
Even if you’re in the Martial Arts Club, you couldn’t.

21:34.560 --> 21:35.440
I see.

21:37.190 --> 21:40.820
I wish I could be a superhero like that.

21:40.820 --> 21:42.050
You can’t!

21:42.050 --> 21:43.800
He may be strong, but...

21:45.580 --> 21:47.320
...he’s a pervert.

21:49.560 --> 21:51.480
I...see...

21:52.480 --> 21:54.060
He’s a pervert?

22:03.800 --> 22:05.730
Get back here and pay for your meal!

22:10.350 --> 22:12.010
This was in your pocket.

22:14.390 --> 22:15.620
Here you go.

22:15.620 --> 22:16.730
Thanks.

22:17.810 --> 22:19.760
Give us your wallet.

22:19.760 --> 22:20.680
Do you take us for chumps?

22:20.680 --> 22:22.150
Do you? Huh?!

22:28.760 --> 22:31.610
If you’d like, you can have my jewels.

22:38.040 --> 22:38.920
This is great.

22:38.920 --> 22:44.500
Just by wearing panties, I can rid the world of all evil!

22:53.870 --> 22:57.770
The Masked Pervert... My prince.

22:57.770 --> 23:00.390
He saved a high school girl.

23:00.390 --> 23:02.720
Really? That’s so cool.

23:04.510 --> 23:06.930
The Masked Pervert is the shit!

23:06.930 --> 23:09.240
I heard he’s super strong.

23:09.240 --> 23:11.760
He even saved Aiko.

23:11.760 --> 23:12.920
Yeah!

23:12.920 --> 23:15.510
Hey, how is he in person?

23:15.510 --> 23:17.510
Well what do you mean how is he?

23:17.510 --> 23:19.660
Is he super buff?

23:20.580 --> 23:21.400
Yeah.

23:22.600 --> 23:24.420
Well...

23:24.420 --> 23:27.300
He might be buff and super strong, but...

23:28.090 --> 23:29.420
...he’s still a pervert, right?

23:30.760 --> 23:31.430
Yeah!

23:31.430 --> 23:34.930
I mean, who in their right mind can walk around public like that?

23:34.930 --> 23:37.680
I bet he gets off on being seen like this because he’s a pervert!

23:37.680 --> 23:39.470
Oh, that’s awful!

23:39.470 --> 23:40.880
But...

23:41.530 --> 23:42.710
I heard he’s really cool.

23:42.710 --> 23:45.650
With panties on his face? Get real!

23:45.650 --> 23:47.830
He’s even wearing fishnet stockings!

23:47.830 --> 23:49.240
He’s such a fucking pervert!

23:49.240 --> 23:51.320
So much so, that it’s hilarious!

23:51.320 --> 23:53.160
Yeah, gross!

23:54.320 --> 23:56.520
He was cool!

23:56.520 --> 23:58.610
He was really cool!

24:02.270 --> 24:03.360
Aiko!

24:06.920 --> 24:08.510
What’s with her?

24:09.730 --> 24:12.080
What’s wrong, Aiko?

24:12.080 --> 24:13.690
They...

24:13.690 --> 24:16.260
They made fun of The Masked Pervert.

24:16.750 --> 24:18.180
Aiko...

24:18.180 --> 24:20.330
I know it’s weird.

24:20.330 --> 24:25.950
He’s a pervert. I know I shouldn’t like him.

24:26.870 --> 24:30.960
But the more I think I shouldn’t, the more I think about him.

24:34.760 --> 24:36.180
I think it’s fine.

24:41.760 --> 24:45.440
He may wear panties on his face...

24:46.710 --> 24:48.850
...but he’s not actually a pervert.

24:49.840 --> 24:51.480
He’s not?

24:52.030 --> 24:55.700
I think...the pervert we know him as is his alter ego.

24:56.740 --> 25:01.020
His normal self isn’t a pervert.

25:01.740 --> 25:03.340
How do you know so much?

25:04.100 --> 25:06.070
Sorry, it was just my imagination.

25:08.110 --> 25:09.950
That’s just my hypothesis.

25:12.700 --> 25:14.520
I hope you’re right.

25:19.950 --> 25:22.080
I’m not a pervert.

25:22.750 --> 25:25.680
It’s true that I am The Masked Pervert.

25:25.680 --> 25:29.030
But I’m really not a pervert.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.310
We come in live at the scene.

25:30.310 --> 25:31.760
Natsumi!

25:33.390 --> 25:35.800
I bought you everything you wanted!

25:36.700 --> 25:37.730
Oh no!

25:45.680 --> 25:48.070
Shit!

25:53.450 --> 25:56.720
It’s not that I want to wear panties.

25:56.720 --> 25:59.360
It’s for the sake of his life.

26:07.760 --> 26:09.840
Good. My disguise is perfect.

26:09.840 --> 26:11.710
Everyone thinks I’m a woman.

26:17.120 --> 26:18.480
Excuse me.

26:18.480 --> 26:20.660
Isn’t that customer a man?

26:20.660 --> 26:21.480
Hm?

26:23.120 --> 26:24.220
He’s huge!

26:25.120 --> 26:26.600
Excuse me.

26:26.600 --> 26:27.960
Excuse me.

26:29.700 --> 26:31.630
Can I try these on?

26:31.630 --> 26:33.690
Yes, go ahead.

26:48.960 --> 26:50.700
Amazing.

26:50.700 --> 26:53.390
It’s like these were made for my face.

26:55.860 --> 26:58.040
I’m in a state of ecsta...

27:01.210 --> 27:02.650
Ecsta...

27:05.280 --> 27:06.680
Damn.

27:07.920 --> 27:12.360
I can’t feel the magma I felt back then.

27:16.730 --> 27:17.740
Not these.

27:20.120 --> 27:22.310
None of these work!

27:22.310 --> 27:23.850
Why?

27:26.430 --> 27:27.480
I get it.

27:28.840 --> 27:37.600
My...superpowers won’t work unless I’m wearing a used pair of panties!

27:38.460 --> 27:43.340
Oh my god! I think that does make me a pervert!

27:43.340 --> 27:47.550
Am I... Am I...a pervert?

27:49.630 --> 27:52.160
What do you think you’re doing, you behemoth?!

27:53.500 --> 27:55.440
Get back here!

27:56.510 --> 27:57.710
No way...

27:58.390 --> 28:00.240
This is unbelievable.

28:22.720 --> 28:23.550
Just leave him be.

28:25.470 --> 28:27.210
I’m not a pervert.

28:28.470 --> 28:32.390
I don’t have to wear panties on my face.

28:34.290 --> 28:38.300
I’ll never...wear panties on my face ever again.

28:43.240 --> 28:45.790
Go away, damn it!

28:45.790 --> 28:48.480
I want to die alone!

28:49.080 --> 28:51.120
If you want to die alone, then kill yourself at home.

29:14.770 --> 29:15.720
Huh...

29:16.360 --> 29:18.040
Is this a pair of balls?

29:19.290 --> 29:23.040
You are touching...my golden balls.

29:30.160 --> 29:32.000
Do you still want to die?

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
I do!

29:33.570 --> 29:35.620
My girlfriend dumped me. My life’s over.

29:36.330 --> 29:39.840
Very well. I will cast a spell on you.

29:43.100 --> 29:43.690
What?

29:50.730 --> 29:52.230
Stop.

29:52.230 --> 29:54.160
Not so close!

29:54.160 --> 29:55.240
Behold my secret move.

29:55.240 --> 29:57.950
Perverted Brainwashing!

30:01.060 --> 30:04.640
Not so close!

30:07.330 --> 30:10.050
Suicide is stupid.

30:10.050 --> 30:12.390
Suicide is stupid.

30:12.390 --> 30:15.880
Suicide is stupid.

30:19.830 --> 30:21.250
How’s that?

30:21.250 --> 30:23.800
I never want to die.

30:26.590 --> 30:28.970
Hey, don’t throw your life away—

30:33.250 --> 30:34.220
The Masked Pervert!

30:35.080 --> 30:37.320
I am in love with you, bro!

30:39.200 --> 30:40.370
Farewell!

30:41.570 --> 30:43.290
He’s running!

30:43.280 --> 30:45.260
Hey, wait!

30:47.210 --> 30:49.420
Hey look!

30:50.450 --> 30:54.080
Wow!

30:54.080 --> 30:55.040
That’s awesome.

30:55.040 --> 30:55.890
Yeah!

30:55.890 --> 30:58.160
Seriously awesome.

30:58.160 --> 31:02.060
Hey, hey, what did The Masked Pervert say to you?

31:01.010 --> 31:02.050
Who are you?

31:02.060 --> 31:02.860
No, what did he say?

31:03.860 --> 31:04.960
Answer me!

31:05.900 --> 31:07.340
Hey, he’s running! He’s running!

31:23.240 --> 31:24.800
Oh, no...

31:24.800 --> 31:29.000
I’m falling even more in love with Prince The Masked Pervert.

31:40.230 --> 31:42.470
I’m not a pervert, Aiko.

31:44.830 --> 31:46.970
I’m really not.

32:15.590 --> 32:22.940
Why are you having a hard time taking over a school of this level?

32:26.420 --> 32:27.730
Hey, Aiko.

32:27.730 --> 32:28.420
Yeah?

32:28.420 --> 32:32.450
If you don’t mind, why don’t we grab burgers or something on the way home?

32:32.450 --> 32:34.280
Oh, I’m sorry!

32:34.280 --> 32:36.850
I’m going out to dinner with my parents tonight.

32:37.310 --> 32:39.920
Do you think I can come along?

32:39.920 --> 32:42.300
Of course not. Why would you?

32:42.300 --> 32:45.190
Then can I just watch from afar?

32:45.190 --> 32:47.270
What are you, a pervert?

32:48.600 --> 32:49.840
What did you say?

32:50.770 --> 32:52.760
I’m not a pervert!

32:54.350 --> 32:55.800
Oh, I know!

32:55.800 --> 32:59.400
How about I hide under the table, so can you step on me while you eat?

32:59.400 --> 33:01.560
Now you really sound like a pervert!

33:01.560 --> 33:03.580
But I’m not!

33:13.360 --> 33:15.470
What’s going on?

33:19.800 --> 33:21.040
You okay?

33:24.610 --> 33:25.900
Are you—

33:28.080 --> 33:30.000
Who would do such a thing?

33:30.760 --> 33:33.400
Are you a member of the Martial Arts Club, as well?

33:35.310 --> 33:37.400
And who might you be?

33:39.330 --> 33:41.200
I just transferred here today.

33:41.200 --> 33:43.160
My name is Ogane Tamao.

33:43.160 --> 33:45.370
I’m the new captain of the Karate Club next door.

33:45.370 --> 33:47.760
Why? Because I beat everyone there up.

33:47.760 --> 33:51.710
And once I beat you, that’s everyone in the Martial Arts Club...

33:51.710 --> 33:54.260
...and I will be the new captain.

33:54.260 --> 33:56.380
You can’t possibly do that.

33:56.380 --> 33:57.680
Well then...

33:57.680 --> 34:00.960
Looks like we have ourselves a nice strong-willed cutie-pie.

34:00.960 --> 34:02.930
Would you like to be our manager?

34:02.930 --> 34:04.480
No.

34:04.480 --> 34:09.730
Even if you refuse, if I beat him, the Martial Arts Club will be mine.

34:10.320 --> 34:11.960
I’ll take you on.

34:13.550 --> 34:18.989
I can’t hand over the club to a guy like you!

34:18.989 --> 34:22.550
Sounds like I’ve finally met a worthy opponent.

34:22.550 --> 34:24.250
It’d be a problem otherwise.

34:24.250 --> 34:30.510
We’re looking very, very hard for someone strong. We’re desperate.

34:33.510 --> 34:34.630
Bring it on.

34:35.159 --> 34:35.929
Okay.

34:36.920 --> 34:37.610
Here I go.

34:42.310 --> 34:43.760
Kyosuke!

34:44.480 --> 34:46.350
You’re just all talk.

34:47.120 --> 34:49.239
Bye-bye then.

34:50.310 --> 34:51.909
Stop.

34:51.909 --> 34:53.650
You’re going to kill him.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.450
Okay.

34:57.450 --> 35:00.660
If you kiss me, I’ll stop.

35:01.630 --> 35:02.430
What?

35:06.790 --> 35:07.770
Wait...

35:07.770 --> 35:09.930
My, oh, my...

35:09.930 --> 35:14.050
The man you risked your life to defend ran away like a coward.

35:14.050 --> 35:16.630
Really, Kyosuke?

35:16.630 --> 35:19.190
Not like that’ll save him.

35:19.190 --> 35:22.120
Well, what will it be?

35:22.120 --> 35:26.140
Would you like to kiss me? Or...kiss me?

35:26.900 --> 35:28.420
Kyosuke...

35:28.420 --> 35:34.150
Hey, if you kiss me, I won’t get so close.

35:37.110 --> 35:38.880
So fluffy.

35:39.400 --> 35:41.050
It’s really fluffy!

35:41.050 --> 35:44.580
It’s as if I’m kissing a rice cake.

35:45.060 --> 35:47.200
That’s no rice cake you’re kissing.

35:47.900 --> 35:51.630
That is my scrotum.

35:56.280 --> 35:59.020
I just... I just kissed your penis!

35:59.020 --> 36:01.480
How are you... How are you going to pay for this?!

36:01.480 --> 36:02.550
The Masked Pervert!

36:02.940 --> 36:05.410
Taking over the school on your first day here?

36:05.410 --> 36:07.580
You sure are cheeky.

36:07.580 --> 36:11.390
I, The Masked Pervert, will teach you a lesson.

36:18.270 --> 36:22.010
So you’re The Masked Pervert I’ve been hearing so much about.

36:22.010 --> 36:24.210
Who would’ve thought you’d be lurking around here.

36:24.210 --> 36:29.130
And...you have the same perverted look they show on the news.

36:30.060 --> 36:33.250
If you take me for a mere pervert, you might regret it.

36:35.200 --> 36:39.750
I’d feel silly getting upset over a pervert, but I guess...

36:39.750 --> 36:41.110
...I just have to beat you.

36:41.110 --> 36:42.630
Let’s. Go.

36:54.970 --> 36:56.140
Yes!

36:57.570 --> 36:59.190
Yes!

37:00.610 --> 37:01.750
Damn it!

37:01.750 --> 37:02.630
What the fuck!

37:05.430 --> 37:07.370
Stop! Stop!

37:08.480 --> 37:09.340
Please!

37:09.340 --> 37:12.560
Master! Master Tamao! Help me! Help—

37:20.520 --> 37:21.590
Interesting.

37:21.590 --> 37:24.180
The rumors don’t do your perversion any justice.

37:24.720 --> 37:26.830
I’m sorry for you, but...

37:26.830 --> 37:30.640
...with panties on my face, I’m invincible.

37:31.950 --> 37:34.240
We’ll see about that.

37:34.240 --> 37:38.290
You’ve left me no choice but to...get serious.

38:13.270 --> 38:15.340
Yes!

38:17.930 --> 38:20.230
The Masked Pervert! Don’t lose!

38:23.210 --> 38:25.160
Take my secret move.

38:25.160 --> 38:27.530
Flying Kick Bondage!

38:29.990 --> 38:31.120
What the?

38:34.190 --> 38:34.950
This is the end.

38:38.240 --> 38:42.950
Ultimate move, The Tightrope of Hell.

38:51.810 --> 38:55.860
Dick! Your dick will break my nose!

38:55.860 --> 39:01.560
If you don’t want my dick to break your nose, leave this school.

39:13.320 --> 39:14.760
Don’t think...

39:14.760 --> 39:17.260
Don’t think you’ve won just yet!

39:23.580 --> 39:26.300
Well...hello again, Miss.

39:26.300 --> 39:29.760
Masked Pervert, just who are you?

39:32.200 --> 39:34.640
Just a pervert who happened to be walking by.

39:35.700 --> 39:36.850
Farewell!

39:41.550 --> 39:43.450
Masked Pervert...

39:43.450 --> 39:47.280
You’re such big, big pervert, but...

39:47.280 --> 39:50.440
...you’re so cool.

39:50.440 --> 39:53.960
What am I supposed to do?

39:55.450 --> 39:58.200
Hey, don’t scare me like that! What do you want?

39:58.000 --> 39:58.800
I need to disinfect it.

39:58.200 --> 39:59.400
What, I’m fine!

39:59.400 --> 40:00.200
You’ll get infected.

39:59.880 --> 40:00.830
Wait, wait, stop, stop!

40:00.830 --> 40:01.390
Is it gonna hurt?

40:01.360 --> 40:02.170
Is it gonna hurt?

40:01.390 --> 40:02.150
Uh...

40:02.170 --> 40:02.810
Just a little.

40:02.810 --> 40:03.690
Then it’s fine! Really!

40:03.690 --> 40:04.400
Bear with me.

40:03.890 --> 40:05.200
I’m fine! I’m fine!

40:04.880 --> 40:05.880
Please bear—

40:05.200 --> 40:07.090
Really stop! Calm down. Calm down for a second.

40:07.750 --> 40:09.340
You idiots really—

40:09.340 --> 40:11.450
I’m talking. I’m talking right now.

40:10.490 --> 40:11.460
Yes, sir.

40:11.480 --> 40:14.890
You idiots really embarrassed me! Like really?

40:14.890 --> 40:17.860
I’m very sorry. We’ll get him next time.

40:17.860 --> 40:18.980
Know your place!

40:18.980 --> 40:22.730
You idiots aren’t capable of taking on that pervert.

40:22.730 --> 40:26.230
But...he hurt you so badly, Master.

40:26.680 --> 40:29.800
Shut up... Hey, shut up!

40:29.800 --> 40:33.860
I didn’t lose! I just underestimated him, okay?

40:33.860 --> 40:36.740
Then...should we give up on that school?

40:36.740 --> 40:38.400
You stupid?!

40:38.400 --> 40:41.850
There’s money buried under that campus.

40:41.860 --> 40:43.660
It’s gotta be there!

40:43.660 --> 40:45.520
It’s 100% under there!

40:45.520 --> 40:47.810
We couldn’t even find it after buying all the land there...

40:47.810 --> 40:53.130
...so we’re gonna fuck that school up, get rid of the students, and shut the school...

40:56.990 --> 40:57.480
But Master—

40:57.480 --> 40:59.240
I was building anticipation!

40:58.320 --> 40:59.240
I’m sorry.

40:59.250 --> 41:00.730
Still building it!

41:00.730 --> 41:01.680
Shut the school...

41:02.600 --> 41:03.760
...down!

41:03.760 --> 41:06.190
But don’t you think he’ll show up again?

41:07.060 --> 41:10.420
Yeah, you’re right.

41:10.430 --> 41:13.720
We can’t do anything unless we beat that guy.

41:17.190 --> 41:21.420
We’ll have to use...that plan.

41:21.420 --> 41:22.810
Yes, Master.

41:22.810 --> 41:26.210
I’ll send in our first assassin.

41:26.570 --> 41:28.570
Wait, does that mean we have more than one?

41:32.040 --> 41:34.690
Wait! Hey, wait!

41:34.690 --> 41:36.010
I didn’t really run away!

41:36.010 --> 41:38.180
You did! Left me alone too!

41:38.180 --> 41:39.540
I was...

41:39.540 --> 41:42.390
I went to get the teachers even after taking so much damage.

41:42.390 --> 41:44.250
But no one came in the end!

41:44.250 --> 41:46.020
It was The Masked Pervert who saved me!

41:46.480 --> 41:48.680
I can’t beat The Masked Pervert, but...

41:48.680 --> 41:51.530
I was also desperately trying to save you!

41:52.520 --> 41:54.340
The hammer of god!

41:54.340 --> 41:55.930
The hammer of god!

41:57.260 --> 41:59.600
Your skirt is an inch too short!

41:59.600 --> 42:00.330
The hammer of god.

42:00.330 --> 42:01.240
The hammer of god!

42:02.900 --> 42:04.740
A logo on your shirt.

42:04.740 --> 42:05.790
The hammer of god!

42:05.790 --> 42:06.750
The hammer of god!

42:08.730 --> 42:09.790
Who are you people?

42:10.360 --> 42:15.620
We’re a group that enforces campus rules.

42:15.620 --> 42:17.260
The Goody Two-shoes Division.

42:17.260 --> 42:19.020
The Goody Two-shoes Division?

42:19.020 --> 42:21.570
Girl, your hair’s too long!

42:21.570 --> 42:22.970
The hammer of god!

42:22.970 --> 42:24.350
The hammer of god!

42:25.170 --> 42:26.520
What do you think you’re doing to Aiko?

42:39.480 --> 42:40.800
Nice to meet you.

42:41.400 --> 42:46.640
I am...Goody Two Shoes Man.

42:46.640 --> 42:48.500
Goody Two Shoes Man?

42:48.500 --> 42:55.590
I will...guide this school...in the right direction. That is my strong will.

42:55.590 --> 43:00.200
Or, or, or... That is how I feel.

43:00.180 --> 43:04.850
I would like to end my introduction now.

43:04.850 --> 43:06.060
What?

43:06.060 --> 43:09.440
The color of the clothes you’re wearing is extremely flashy.

43:09.440 --> 43:12.020
Or perhaps, extremely tropical.

43:12.020 --> 43:14.490
Or maybe even tropicana.

43:14.490 --> 43:22.450
I would like to...end...my...speech now.

43:29.750 --> 43:30.920
The hammer of god!

43:31.650 --> 43:32.700
Kyosuke!

43:32.700 --> 43:33.880
Aiko, we’re hopeless!

43:33.880 --> 43:35.920
We have to get away.

43:45.360 --> 43:46.360
Wait here.

43:46.360 --> 43:48.090
Where are you going?

43:48.090 --> 43:50.330
I can’t let a guy like that do as he pleases.

43:50.330 --> 43:52.000
But what will you do?

44:02.330 --> 44:03.290
Huh?

44:04.560 --> 44:08.520
Shit. My panties are in my bag.

44:08.520 --> 44:11.520
But he’s waiting in front of the classroom.

44:11.520 --> 44:13.560
What to do, Kyosuke?

44:17.260 --> 44:18.520
I know!

44:30.060 --> 44:31.410
Damn...

44:32.270 --> 44:34.890
Am I even allowed to do this?

44:34.890 --> 44:39.110
But...everyone in school is suffering.

44:39.110 --> 44:41.560
I need panties.

44:42.370 --> 44:46.130
Fight the sense of guilt and win, Kyosuke!

44:47.740 --> 44:50.200
I’m not a petty panty thief.

44:51.310 --> 44:55.430
I’m just a superhero that happens to need panties.

45:11.430 --> 45:12.930
You’re wearing make-up.

45:12.930 --> 45:13.600
The hammer of god!

45:13.600 --> 45:14.160
The hammer of god!

45:14.160 --> 45:15.860
You’re not wearing your in-door shoes correctly!

45:15.860 --> 45:16.540
The hammer of god!

45:16.540 --> 45:17.800
The hammer of god!

45:24.790 --> 45:29.070
Am I breaking any school regulations, Goody Two-shoes-man?

45:32.620 --> 45:34.770
Oh, mama...

45:35.400 --> 45:37.960
There you are, The Masked Pervert.

45:37.960 --> 45:45.260
Your existence itself...or, or... Your mere existence is a crime.

45:45.260 --> 45:47.300
That is my answer to your question.

45:48.300 --> 45:53.060
I don’t need a bogus goody two-shoes guy to deny me of my existence.

45:53.060 --> 45:56.440
Of course you’re not allowed to wear panties on your face at school!

45:57.250 --> 45:57.900
What?

45:57.900 --> 46:02.400
I’ve never seen anyone at school with their nipples...

46:03.230 --> 46:05.360
...and their butt...

46:05.360 --> 46:09.830
...so exposed to the eyes of fellow students.

46:09.830 --> 46:11.330
That’s...

46:11.330 --> 46:14.240
I believe you’ve found yourself in the wrong place, Masked Pervert.

46:14.760 --> 46:19.930
I will use my Goody Two Shoes power and defeat you to—

46:19.930 --> 46:21.980
That’s the bell. We need to get to class.

46:21.980 --> 46:22.590
You dweeb!

46:22.590 --> 46:24.420
Oh, no I won’t.

46:24.420 --> 46:25.880
I won’t be going to class.

46:27.200 --> 46:33.090
Now, put a school uniform on this clown!

46:36.520 --> 46:37.730
Stop!

46:40.150 --> 46:43.320
By wearing clothes, I’ll lose my pervert power...

46:46.530 --> 46:52.480
So, you did have some sense of guilt in you; you fell for my plan so easily.

46:52.480 --> 46:54.620
Now, finish him!

46:54.620 --> 46:55.320
The hammer of god!

46:55.950 --> 46:57.200
The hammer of god!

46:59.080 --> 47:02.230
You sure didn’t live up to your name, Masked Pervert.

47:02.230 --> 47:06.170
It makes me very happy to welcome you as one of us now.

47:11.000 --> 47:12.100
The Masked Pervert!

47:13.890 --> 47:16.480
Stop, stay away! It’s dangerous here.

47:16.480 --> 47:21.230
It’s okay to be a pervert! If you’re not a pervert, you’re not The Masked Pervert!

47:22.280 --> 47:27.520
That woman is extremely annoying.

47:28.230 --> 47:30.270
Let’s make her face the hammer of god.

47:36.330 --> 47:37.720
What?

47:41.080 --> 47:42.760
Strange.

47:42.760 --> 47:46.380
Our amazing onslaught didn’t affect you?

47:47.330 --> 47:49.940
You seem to be misunderstanding.

47:49.940 --> 47:55.140
The more you hit me, the more I enjoy!

47:55.140 --> 47:56.320
Oh my god!

47:56.320 --> 47:58.360
Yes!

47:58.360 --> 48:00.420
More!

48:00.420 --> 48:05.590
You were...enjoying the entire beating?

48:06.140 --> 48:09.660
Yes, I was indeed.

48:09.660 --> 48:11.120
The entire time!

48:12.390 --> 48:14.040
Impossible!

48:14.040 --> 48:15.750
A candle would’ve made it better.

48:17.800 --> 48:19.130
You’re a pervert!

48:20.800 --> 48:22.960
Unrivaled pervert!

48:24.820 --> 48:27.770
Out with clothes!

48:30.450 --> 48:31.920
Remember this.

48:31.920 --> 48:37.760
In this 21st century of today, being a pervert is true justice!

48:37.760 --> 48:38.970
What?

48:40.650 --> 48:42.390
Have a taste of my ultimate attack.

48:43.690 --> 48:46.520
Spinning Fire of Death!

48:56.840 --> 48:57.740
Amazing!

48:57.740 --> 48:59.490
What an incredible attack!

49:09.000 --> 49:10.440
My glasses.

49:10.440 --> 49:11.630
Where are my glasses.

49:12.200 --> 49:17.020
Goody Two Shoes Man, try seeing the world without your glasses.

49:18.800 --> 49:20.320
Master Tamao!

49:19.960 --> 49:20.880
Be quiet. Be quiet.

49:20.300 --> 49:22.850
Master Tamao! Master Tamao!

49:20.880 --> 49:23.370
Dust. Dust. You’re stirring up dust.

49:22.850 --> 49:24.970
Goody Two Shoes Man has lost.

49:25.670 --> 49:27.190
What?

49:27.800 --> 49:29.420
What?!

49:29.420 --> 49:34.130
The pervert managed to resist the Goody Two Shoes Man’s logic?

49:34.130 --> 49:35.100
Yes.

49:35.100 --> 49:38.500
He is... He is no ordinary pervert!

49:44.430 --> 49:47.040
Man, like are you serious?

49:47.040 --> 49:55.590
Geez! Can you just send in the second, the third, and even the fourth assassins who might be able to beat him?

49:55.590 --> 49:56.430
Yes, sir!

49:56.430 --> 49:59.770
Now! Now! Now! Now!

49:59.770 --> 50:00.840
Run!

50:00.840 --> 50:02.020
Go call them!

50:02.480 --> 50:03.850
Door! Door! Door!

50:03.850 --> 50:06.020
Close it! Close it!

50:07.390 --> 50:09.690
It’s not even!

50:13.680 --> 50:15.480
You’re really gross.

50:15.480 --> 50:17.110
Gross!

50:17.110 --> 50:20.390
Why don’t you be pleasant like me?

50:22.040 --> 50:23.620
versus Pleasant-man.

50:23.620 --> 50:29.960
No matter how pleasant you may be, I will never give in to you, Pleasant-man!

50:29.960 --> 50:31.350
Oh, really?

50:38.620 --> 50:42.120
You’re...just drinking water!

50:47.380 --> 50:50.560
What?! Now you really feel pleasant.

50:52.900 --> 50:56.820
Let’s all be pleasant!

51:07.070 --> 51:08.570
He’s so pleasant...

51:09.440 --> 51:14.170
At this rate, I may also become pleasant.

51:18.270 --> 51:22.570
Secret move – Pervert Dance!

51:30.790 --> 51:32.080
I can’t breathe!

51:32.560 --> 51:36.190
If I see anything too disturbing, I can’t breathe.

51:39.790 --> 51:42.060
Please stop! Please...

51:44.290 --> 51:47.100
My name is Manly-man!

51:47.100 --> 51:49.670
I can’t let a pervert like you roam this earth!

51:50.200 --> 51:52.290
versus Manly-man.

51:56.870 --> 51:57.770
What are you doing?

51:57.770 --> 51:59.210
Fooled you!

51:59.210 --> 52:02.270
My real name is Moho-man!

52:02.480 --> 52:04.710
Real name, Moho-man.

52:04.720 --> 52:07.820
I actually love men like you!

52:07.820 --> 52:08.340
What?

52:08.340 --> 52:10.640
Let me kiss you!

52:10.640 --> 52:12.230
Stop, you pervert!

52:16.320 --> 52:17.750
Where’s the evil doer?

52:17.750 --> 52:18.950
Over there!

52:20.490 --> 52:23.540
Masked Pervert, this is the end for you.

52:26.980 --> 52:27.990
Who are you?

52:27.990 --> 52:30.830
My name is Slender-But-Fit Man.

52:31.250 --> 52:33.460
versus Slender-But-Fit Man.

52:33.460 --> 52:35.890
You’re just plain and simply slender!

52:36.860 --> 52:40.080
The kind of muscular body you have isn’t cool anymore!

52:40.080 --> 52:43.240
The ladies like slender guys.

52:43.960 --> 52:46.120
I give... up.

52:53.810 --> 52:55.650
Fuck!

52:55.650 --> 52:57.820
I just threw my chicken!

52:59.280 --> 53:00.740
Like seriously?

53:00.740 --> 53:03.770
You’re not supposed to throw perfectly good chicken! 

53:05.180 --> 53:07.080
I just threw a chicken!

53:07.810 --> 53:09.880
I just threw... I just...

53:12.190 --> 53:13.480
Fuck!

53:14.220 --> 53:15.670
Why?

53:15.670 --> 53:19.470
Why can’t you beat the pervert?

53:19.470 --> 53:23.350
Master Tamao, I have an idea.

53:25.610 --> 53:28.230
What may that be?

53:28.780 --> 53:34.720
I have collected data on the past appearances of The Masked Pervert...

53:35.560 --> 53:38.920
...and the results are very interesting.

53:38.900 --> 53:40.350
Okay.

53:40.350 --> 53:42.900
I suppose I can lend an ear.

53:44.120 --> 53:53.330
When he appears, there’s Himeno Aiko nearby almost every time.

53:54.620 --> 53:57.590
What are you implying?

53:57.590 --> 53:58.760
It appears...

54:00.410 --> 54:04.880
...The Masked Pervert may have...a crush on her.

54:08.330 --> 54:09.610
You know.

54:09.610 --> 54:11.860
I think you’re on to something.

54:12.610 --> 54:14.580
What shall we do?

54:14.580 --> 54:16.360
I don’t know...

54:16.360 --> 54:19.860
Even if we attack, it’ll just backfire.

54:20.780 --> 54:23.140
How about we send <i>him</i> ?

54:24.180 --> 54:25.460
Yes.

54:28.790 --> 54:33.580
He could...do the job.

54:44.730 --> 54:52.450
Mrs. Yoshizawa is on maternity leave so I, Mr. Towatari, will be your temporary math teacher.

54:52.450 --> 54:53.700
Nice to meet you.

54:55.030 --> 54:57.270
I’d like to start class now.

54:58.050 --> 55:01.170
Please, open the textbook to page 22.

55:01.170 --> 55:02.880
We’ll be covering trigonometric functions.

55:02.880 --> 55:07.740
Does everyone know that...

55:07.740 --> 55:09.550
...these triangles in trigonometric functions—

55:09.550 --> 55:09.990
Guys!

55:11.040 --> 55:13.000
The teacher’s talking.

55:13.000 --> 55:14.640
Please, be quiet.

55:14.640 --> 55:16.620
Th-That’s right!

55:19.200 --> 55:21.290
Thank you, Himeno.

55:25.240 --> 55:26.410
You’re welcome.

55:41.810 --> 55:45.190
Are you really somebody’s mother? Damn it...

55:45.770 --> 55:47.010
What’s wrong?

55:47.010 --> 55:48.090
Let’s eat.

55:48.090 --> 55:52.870
Sorry, I was thinking I should go on a diet.

55:52.870 --> 55:54.490
What do you mean?

55:54.490 --> 55:55.620
You’re weird.

55:57.350 --> 56:00.720
Oh, if you want to lose weight, why not go to a gym?

56:00.720 --> 56:02.110
A gym?

56:02.110 --> 56:03.120
Maybe.

56:03.120 --> 56:05.280
I’ve been going to a gym lately.

56:05.280 --> 56:07.510
Just swimming in the pool makes your body feel good.

56:08.200 --> 56:09.770
Pool?

56:09.770 --> 56:11.520
Wait, Aiko...

56:11.520 --> 56:12.760
In your swimsuit?

56:12.760 --> 56:14.670
Of course...

56:14.670 --> 56:15.540
That’s not good!

56:16.020 --> 56:18.530
A lot of people are going to look at you in your swimsuit.

56:18.530 --> 56:21.100
What are you talking about? They’re there to work out.

56:21.100 --> 56:22.520
No! They’re ogling at you for sure!

56:22.520 --> 56:26.520
The fat old men are just pretending to work out to ogle you!

56:26.520 --> 56:28.370
Maybe they’re even going underwater to look at your—

56:28.950 --> 56:30.140
Damn it!

56:30.140 --> 56:31.700
They’re not!

56:33.790 --> 56:34.680
Oh, I know!

56:34.680 --> 56:37.510
Why don’t you come try out this Sunday?

56:38.250 --> 56:39.460
The gym?

56:39.460 --> 56:40.120
Yeah!

56:40.120 --> 56:42.120
Swimming is a great way to lose weight.

56:43.240 --> 56:46.720
Are you going to swim with me?

56:46.720 --> 56:47.830
Of course!

56:51.130 --> 56:53.050
Kyosuke!

56:53.600 --> 56:54.980
Oh, yeah!

56:55.510 --> 56:57.000
I love you.

56:58.840 --> 57:00.000
Stop!

57:00.970 --> 57:05.190
Stop fantasizing about Aiko in her swimsuit!

57:08.110 --> 57:09.300
Shikijoh.

57:10.380 --> 57:10.820
Yes?

57:11.400 --> 57:14.860
Why is your desk raised?

57:17.360 --> 57:20.770
Oh, I wonder why...

57:21.320 --> 57:22.250
Ow.

57:23.880 --> 57:26.050
What’s stuck under there?

57:27.010 --> 57:30.200
I... I don’t know...

57:32.890 --> 57:35.480
Okay, class is over.

57:35.480 --> 57:38.180
Himeno, come to the special purpose room later.

57:39.760 --> 57:43.540
I heard that you’re a little behind being new.

57:43.540 --> 57:44.850
I’ll tutor you.

57:46.440 --> 57:47.020
Okay.

57:51.870 --> 57:53.300
What’s wrong, Kyosuke?

57:53.300 --> 57:54.490
Don’t look!

57:55.000 --> 57:56.540
What?

58:14.520 --> 58:15.760
Hey.

58:18.580 --> 58:19.980
Thanks for coming.

58:20.880 --> 58:22.380
Thank you for helping me.

58:29.660 --> 58:30.840
Now...

58:32.050 --> 58:35.680
Let’s begin...our one-on-one lecture.

58:37.120 --> 58:38.300
Okay.

58:53.640 --> 58:54.580
Oh no!

58:54.580 --> 58:56.520
Aiko is drowning!

59:04.000 --> 59:05.450
Are you okay?

59:05.450 --> 59:07.810
Drowning in a pool? You’re crazy.

59:09.160 --> 59:11.160
I must do CPR.

59:21.450 --> 59:25.020
What are you doing, you perv?

59:31.160 --> 59:34.980
Your hopelessness never ceases to amaze me.

59:34.980 --> 59:36.440
Turn the TV on!

59:36.440 --> 59:38.780
A man among men is on.

59:42.600 --> 59:46.680
He was known to be a superhero before, but suddenly...

59:46.680 --> 59:50.120
Suddenly, he’s running around flipping everyone’s skirt!

59:51.570 --> 59:52.520
What?

59:52.520 --> 59:57.200
I guess this means...The Masked Pervert was just a pervert?

59:57.200 --> 01:00:00.110
Well, he is wearing underwear on his face.

01:00:00.110 --> 01:00:01.850
No!

01:00:01.850 --> 01:00:03.620
The Masked Pervert isn’t a pervert!

01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:05.300
What are you saying?

01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:07.060
This is just beautiful!

01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:08.830
The best! Amazing!

01:00:08.830 --> 01:00:10.400
Wonderful!

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:11.540
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:14.450
Keep going! Keep up the joke!

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:18.210
That’s odd...

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:20.810
Damn...

01:00:20.810 --> 01:00:23.170
Fake Masked Pervert...

01:00:23.170 --> 01:00:24.610
Where are you?

01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:29.490
You!

01:00:30.070 --> 01:00:31.520
Who are you?

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:34.480
My name... is The Masked Pervert.

01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:35.820
What?

01:00:38.250 --> 01:00:39.560
You won’t get away!

01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:02.570
Damn...

01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:16.570
Damn it! God damn it!

01:01:18.110 --> 01:01:20.740
Is something wrong, Shikijoh?

01:01:21.610 --> 01:01:22.630
Mr. Towatari.

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:25.920
No, nothing’s wrong.

01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:29.410
Himeno Aiko.

01:01:31.650 --> 01:01:34.760
She’s...a good student.

01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:37.700
Y-Yes.

01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:38.920
Yes, she is.

01:01:40.050 --> 01:01:43.020
Do you...well...

01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:54.000
Do you like her?

01:01:56.540 --> 01:01:59.770
No, me? Like her?

01:02:04.690 --> 01:02:06.310
You don’t like her?

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:08.530
Well...

01:02:09.350 --> 01:02:11.770
You’re a teacher.

01:02:11.770 --> 01:02:13.250
I can’t tell you.

01:02:13.250 --> 01:02:16.180
Yes, well...of course.

01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:25.340
Aiko, do you want to go to a restaurant to make plans for Sunday?

01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:26.390
I’m sorry.

01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:28.410
Mr. Towatari’s tutoring me again.

01:02:28.410 --> 01:02:30.020
Oh, okay.

01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:36.700
The Daily Bugle.

01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:38.370
Extra! Extra!

01:02:38.370 --> 01:02:40.010
Extra! The Daily Bugle.

01:02:40.010 --> 01:02:41.160
Extra!

01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:42.380
Extra.

01:02:43.730 --> 01:02:45.360
What? The Masked Pervert?

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:47.430
The Masked Pervert? Is he really?

01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:54.210
That jerk.

01:02:56.990 --> 01:02:59.060
You ready, Kyosuke?

01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:03.640
Let’s take on that Bizzaro The Masked Pervert this Sunday.

01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:06.680
We have to stop that merciless pervert!

01:03:09.210 --> 01:03:10.140
I can’t.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.310
Why?

01:03:12.310 --> 01:03:14.220
He’s made a public statement!

01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:16.560
We know he’ll be there.

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:17.940
It’s our perfect chance!

01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:19.650
I can’t.

01:03:19.650 --> 01:03:21.190
Why, Kyosuke?

01:03:21.190 --> 01:03:22.440
I have a date!

01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:26.790
A date?

01:03:27.930 --> 01:03:31.440
I have a date with Aiko at the gym.

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:33.040
A pool date.

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:35.750
She’ll be in her swimsuit.

01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:38.160
Oh my god...

01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:41.130
I’ll get to see her wearing swimsuit with the naked eye!

01:03:41.130 --> 01:03:44.070
If I’m lucky... <i>If</i> I’m lucky...

01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:47.860
She’ll ask me to put on something like tanning oil.

01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:51.550
She may ask me with those cute innocent eyes.

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:54.720
Why should I have to fight a stupid pervert instead?

01:03:56.030 --> 01:03:59.440
Has god forsaken us?

01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:03.020
Just let that guy do whatever he wants.

01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:04.620
I see.

01:04:05.150 --> 01:04:06.860
If it means sacrificing your date...

01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:10.400
...you’d rather have 1,000 ladies have their skirts flipped.

01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:14.370
Yeah.

01:04:16.810 --> 01:04:18.750
Very well.

01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:27.920
Okay, so...

01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:29.870
How about we go to the one in Shibuya?

01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:31.950
Yeah.

01:04:34.490 --> 01:04:36.100
Wow, I’m so excited.

01:04:40.830 --> 01:04:41.940
What’s wrong?

01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:43.420
It’s just...

01:04:44.330 --> 01:04:49.970
...The Masked Pervert I loved...was such a horrible person.

01:04:50.530 --> 01:04:51.410
What?

01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:57.720
When he saved me, he was so handsome.

01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:00.870
But now, he’s so heartless.

01:05:00.870 --> 01:05:03.290
No...that’s just a misunderstanding.

01:05:03.290 --> 01:05:04.740
What’s there to misunderstand?

01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:09.300
He was just a pervert after all.

01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:10.800
What?

01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:13.720
He was just a pervert! That’s all!

01:05:16.940 --> 01:05:18.080
Aiko!

01:05:23.690 --> 01:05:26.310
What should I do?

01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:29.780
What’s there to contemplate?

01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:32.640
You’ve already decided to go on the date.

01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:36.760
But...I want to defeat him with my own hands.

01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:38.550
Oh?

01:05:38.550 --> 01:05:41.040
You don’t want Aiko to disdain us?

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:42.720
I don’t want her to dislike The Masked Pervert.

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:44.960
Because I am The Masked Pervert!

01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:48.270
But I want to go on the date!

01:05:49.100 --> 01:05:50.000
I do...

01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:52.800
What will you do, Kyosuke?

01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:55.720
Only you can decide.

01:05:55.720 --> 01:06:00.360
The date...or the battle.

01:06:09.350 --> 01:06:10.700
Aiko!

01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:11.980
Over here!

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.560
All right, let’s go to the gym!

01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:22.220
I’m sorry, Kyosuke.

01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:24.720
Hm? What’s wrong?

01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:27.960
Mr. Towatari’s tutoring me again.

01:06:29.070 --> 01:06:32.680
What? Are you serious?

01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:35.420
I’m really sorry!

01:06:38.670 --> 01:06:39.650
Why...?

01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:43.930
Why...are you so eager about math?

01:06:45.730 --> 01:06:48.310
It’s because...I’m behind.

01:06:48.310 --> 01:06:50.690
You can take a break on a Sunday.

01:06:50.690 --> 01:06:51.650
That’s not it.

01:06:51.650 --> 01:06:53.190
What’s not it?

01:06:53.870 --> 01:06:54.920
I think...

01:06:56.070 --> 01:06:57.810
I have a crush.

01:07:01.570 --> 01:07:03.620
You’re kidding, right?

01:07:04.130 --> 01:07:05.860
I have a crush on him.

01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:12.210
No...

01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:16.790
I’m really sorry, Kyosuke.

01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:26.770
As he’s previously said, will he really flip 1,000 skirts?

01:07:26.770 --> 01:07:31.240
Well, it looks like there are already some casualties.

01:07:27.530 --> 01:07:28.240
Hey!

01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:28.730
Yes?

01:07:28.730 --> 01:07:30.040
That’s really in the way!

01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:31.260
What is?

01:07:31.260 --> 01:07:32.220
That!

01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:34.320
Oh, no!

01:07:39.070 --> 01:07:40.260
Are you okay?

01:07:40.930 --> 01:07:41.560
Hello?

01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:43.700
Are you okay?

01:07:46.850 --> 01:07:47.890
Are you fucking serious?

01:07:47.890 --> 01:07:48.710
Pardon?

01:07:55.710 --> 01:07:57.840
Are you fucking serious?!

01:08:19.830 --> 01:08:21.630
628!

01:08:26.430 --> 01:08:27.580
Miss...

01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:30.850
What are you hiding in your crotch?

01:08:31.590 --> 01:08:35.040
That is my scrotum.

01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:35.880
What?

01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:39.130
Who are you?

01:08:39.130 --> 01:08:41.550
Who are <i>you</i> ?

01:08:41.550 --> 01:08:43.800
I am The Masked Pervert.

01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:48.270
No, I am...The Masked Pervert.

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:52.080
You’re a fake who’s taken my name.

01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:54.100
I’ll teach you a lesson.

01:08:57.750 --> 01:08:59.990
Am I fake?

01:09:01.130 --> 01:09:03.600
You’re the fake!

01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:09.540
If you’d like, we can fight it out to see which of us is real.

01:09:10.590 --> 01:09:12.359
Bring it on!

01:09:39.090 --> 01:09:40.160
What?

01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:42.500
Damn...I’m tied up.

01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:45.279
Now...

01:09:45.279 --> 01:09:47.569
Here I go!

01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:57.570
Why...are you binding yourself when I’m tied up?

01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:04.320
I’m tied up, but I’m just being watched.

01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:09.360
I’m tied up but I’m left stranded...

01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:11.840
The tease and denial!

01:10:15.390 --> 01:10:17.120
I’m powering up...

01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:20.940
My perversion power is accumulating.

01:10:21.370 --> 01:10:22.450
What?

01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:26.180
I can’t feel anything...

01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:29.200
I can’t feel any perversion power!

01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:31.800
Excuse me!

01:10:32.910 --> 01:10:34.400
Stop!

01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:36.340
You can’t hide!

01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:39.570
I can smell your panties from a mile away!

01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:54.760
What are you doing here?

01:10:56.390 --> 01:10:59.640
I was in ecstasy being all alone!

01:11:00.750 --> 01:11:02.290
I thought I told you.

01:11:02.290 --> 01:11:05.350
I came to defeat you!

01:11:12.580 --> 01:11:14.410
Naive.

01:11:14.410 --> 01:11:17.080
You’re so naive.

01:11:33.710 --> 01:11:38.520
Am I... Am I going to lose?

01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:44.360
Your loss, Masked Pervert.

01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:48.780
I haven’t lost just yet.

01:11:57.540 --> 01:11:59.510
Listen well, Masked Pervert.

01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:03.400
You think you’re a pervert?

01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:07.350
Think again!

01:12:10.630 --> 01:12:13.120
Your perversion is fake!

01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:15.700
Masked Pervert.

01:12:16.470 --> 01:12:21.190
Actually, I’ll just call you <i>Normal-Man</i>.

01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:23.040
Stop!

01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:25.020
I <i>am</i> The Masked Pervert!

01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:26.720
Are you?

01:12:27.690 --> 01:12:32.870
Look at my panties, Masked Pervert.

01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:38.050
You wear them with the inside to your face.

01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:40.950
Of course you are.

01:12:41.710 --> 01:12:45.670
You’re wearing them to smell a woman's crotch.

01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:48.010
But look at me!

01:12:50.340 --> 01:12:55.200
Mine are turned inside out.

01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:58.560
That’s right.

01:12:59.390 --> 01:13:04.810
I...have the outside towards my face!

01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:08.620
I can’t smell them even if I wanted to.

01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:14.660
I can’t smell the owner's crotch.

01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:18.160
I want to, but I can’t!

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.370
Do you see how humiliated I am?

01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:29.850
I... am being teased by the panties!

01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:36.380
“You don’t even deserve to smell me!”

01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:45.810
Oh, I am so undeserving.

01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:51.190
So low that the panties belittle me - and how do I feel?

01:13:51.190 --> 01:13:56.030
I’m in ecstasy from the humiliation!

01:13:56.510 --> 01:13:59.280
In ecstasy for being humiliated like a bug!

01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:02.370
You’re a fucking pervert.

01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:07.990
Now take a look at my crotch.

01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:12.630
You may be showing off your big scrotum.

01:14:13.510 --> 01:14:16.220
But look between my legs!

01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:21.180
By using a powerful jock strap, I’ve managed to suppress my penis.

01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:25.440
What do you reckon the public will think when they see it?

01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:28.450
“Huh?”

01:14:29.510 --> 01:14:34.890
“He...has a small penis.”

01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:38.030
“So funny.”

01:14:38.030 --> 01:14:44.220
“He’s proudly exhibiting his body, but his genitals are so small.”

01:14:45.860 --> 01:14:47.640
“He should be embarrassed.”

01:14:51.270 --> 01:14:53.910
That’s what people think.

01:14:55.390 --> 01:14:59.280
That my penis is tiny!

01:15:13.590 --> 01:15:16.970
I’m in ecstasy from the humiliation!

01:15:21.030 --> 01:15:22.770
Impossible...

01:15:22.770 --> 01:15:27.160
I’ve never seen such a pervert.

01:15:33.990 --> 01:15:36.090
Do you understand, Masked Pervert?

01:15:37.610 --> 01:15:40.950
This is what it means to be a pervert.

01:15:40.950 --> 01:15:42.920
I can’t win...

01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:46.360
I can’t beat this pervert.

01:15:47.650 --> 01:15:49.480
Understand?

01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:55.920
You’re not even close to being a pervert.

01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:58.450
Is that what it is?

01:15:58.450 --> 01:16:04.100
Am I...normal?

01:16:04.100 --> 01:16:05.440
That’s right.

01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:11.450
You have no right to wear panties on your face.

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:27.090
Just as I suspected.

01:16:28.380 --> 01:16:29.560
Shikijoh Kyosuke.

01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:35.730
How do you... know me?

01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:46.740
Don’t ever interrupt me again!

01:16:54.880 --> 01:17:00.840
I’m... not a pervert?

01:17:19.490 --> 01:17:20.780
Forget it.

01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:25.570
It has nothing to do with me now.

01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:39.190
1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8... 9... 10!

01:17:39.190 --> 01:17:43.420
You know, this school’s become quite peaceful lately.

01:17:43.420 --> 01:17:46.970
Though there were a bunch of weird people walking around until recently.

01:17:46.970 --> 01:17:51.390
But now, we can practice in peace.

01:17:51.390 --> 01:17:53.360
We’ll see about that.

01:17:57.010 --> 01:18:00.190
You’re...The Masked Pervert!

01:18:00.190 --> 01:18:03.090
The man who saved our club from being taken over!

01:18:03.710 --> 01:18:06.320
I spent some time thinking, and...

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:10.620
...I’ve decided to stop being such a phony superhero.

01:18:11.430 --> 01:18:14.740
Yay! The Masked Pervert’s on my side!

01:18:14.740 --> 01:18:18.130
Now, I can just do what I want at this school.

01:18:18.130 --> 01:18:21.450
Let’s...go.

01:18:36.350 --> 01:18:38.170
Okay...

01:18:38.170 --> 01:18:43.560
Now, the campus and the buried money...is mine.

01:18:52.540 --> 01:18:53.330
Huh?

01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:00.070
What?

01:19:03.030 --> 01:19:05.090
What exactly happened here?

01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:09.990
Masked…Pervert...

01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:18.660
Let it go.

01:19:20.820 --> 01:19:25.880
A normal person...doesn’t need to fight.

01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:32.360
Kyosuke!

01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:34.830
The Masked Pervert’s attacking the students, and they’re in trouble.

01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:41.370
It’s got...nothing to do with me now.

01:19:41.370 --> 01:19:43.000
But Aiko’s also...

01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:48.000
What about Aiko?

01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:50.720
She went back to the main building to see Mr. Towatari.

01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:55.730
Oh my god!

01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:02.310
Aiko!

01:20:07.390 --> 01:20:09.800
Aiko!

01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:19.540
Aiko!

01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:22.790
If The Masked Pervert comes, you must run!

01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:23.760
I can’t.

01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:26.280
Mr. Towatari’s tutoring me right now.

01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:27.810
I must respect him.

01:20:29.230 --> 01:20:31.160
He’s not here.

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:32.720
He is.

01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:34.100
He’s right there.

01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:39.640
No...

01:20:40.450 --> 01:20:44.310
Are you in a trance?

01:20:44.310 --> 01:20:48.260
Mr. Towatari, Kyosuke’s saying something weird.

01:20:49.740 --> 01:20:53.290
Mr. Towatari, just who are you?

01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:09.840
What the fuck?

01:21:11.270 --> 01:21:14.430
Oh...looks like you’ve found my identity.

01:21:19.230 --> 01:21:21.310
You're the phony Masked Pervert?

01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:24.160
I thought I told you, Shikijoh Kyosuke.

01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:27.520
I’m the real deal.

01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:32.360
How dare you brainwash Aiko!

01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:36.470
This is all for my master, Ogane Tamao.

01:21:41.410 --> 01:21:43.840
You can’t transform into The Masked Pervert anymore.

01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:46.040
You’re hardly a threat.

01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:09.440
I’ll be taking Aiko, thanks.

01:22:16.030 --> 01:22:17.490
Come back!

01:22:25.750 --> 01:22:27.230
Damn...

01:22:32.340 --> 01:22:33.880
I’m sorry yet again!

01:22:56.470 --> 01:23:00.270
Yes...this feels perfect on my face.

01:23:00.270 --> 01:23:02.430
The excitement is welling within...

01:23:12.100 --> 01:23:14.050
This can’t be...

01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:24.470
I can’t... transform anymore?

01:23:29.430 --> 01:23:36.060
I’m... really a normal person now.

01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:45.880
What’s wrong with it?

01:23:48.490 --> 01:23:51.600
You never wanted to believe you were a pervert.

01:23:54.220 --> 01:23:55.520
That’s right.

01:23:58.100 --> 01:24:00.470
You’re a normal person.

01:24:02.010 --> 01:24:03.100
That’s what you wanted.

01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:12.860
Kyosuke.

01:24:12.860 --> 01:24:14.360
If you’d like, use this.

01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:16.600
The Masked Pervert I loved was...

01:24:19.750 --> 01:24:21.090
No...

01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:27.040
Who ever said only a pervert could save her?

01:24:28.850 --> 01:24:29.690
It’s true.

01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:32.910
I’m usually incredibly weak.

01:24:34.550 --> 01:24:41.960
But I should... I should at least have the power to save Aiko!

01:24:44.010 --> 01:24:49.520
I can smell where she is from a mile away!

01:25:05.050 --> 01:25:07.800
You live up to your name, pervert.

01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:10.330
You followed her scent?

01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:14.650
She has nothing to do with our battle.

01:25:15.950 --> 01:25:17.800
Give her back.

01:25:18.170 --> 01:25:21.070
Well...I wonder where she is.

01:25:21.070 --> 01:25:24.390
Are the young guys doing something to her back there?

01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:27.310
What?

01:25:27.310 --> 01:25:30.600
You sure gave us a lot of trouble, Masked Pervert.

01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:35.270
But in order for us to proceed with our takeover plans accordingly...

01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:40.780
...let’s have you...die right here, right now.

01:25:41.370 --> 01:25:45.700
I won’t die until I go to the pool with Aiko!

01:25:45.700 --> 01:25:47.910
Is that so?

01:25:47.910 --> 01:25:55.500
Then I’ll kill both of you, so you can go swim in the pool of blood in hell.

01:25:55.500 --> 01:25:58.000
Let’s...go.

01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:19.320
Wow.

01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:22.440
You’re quite good even without panties on your face.

01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:26.120
Now, it’s time we also... went all out.

01:26:43.670 --> 01:26:46.770
You put up a good fight.

01:26:46.770 --> 01:26:49.720
I’ll tell her how bravely you fought.

01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:54.880
Though since you can’t transform, this was all you could do.

01:26:56.750 --> 01:26:58.020
Too bad.

01:26:58.020 --> 01:26:59.140
Stop!

01:27:00.860 --> 01:27:04.530
Aiko!

01:27:04.530 --> 01:27:09.370
She’ll soon be eaten by the beasts.

01:27:09.370 --> 01:27:11.280
How can this be...

01:27:12.610 --> 01:27:17.360
I can hear her scream, but I can’t do a thing...

01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:21.000
How humiliating.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:25.370
I can hear her scream, but I can’t do a thing.

01:27:25.370 --> 01:27:28.260
I’m such a useless man.

01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:33.180
I’m in ecstasy from the humiliation!

01:27:33.180 --> 01:27:34.640
That’s right.

01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:37.200
You’re no ordinary pervert.

01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:39.040
Remember...

01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:43.610
You’ve carried on my will...as a pervert who fights for justice!

01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:51.530
I feel something...

01:27:51.530 --> 01:27:57.320
The magma I felt the first time is slowly welling up.

01:27:58.330 --> 01:27:59.870
Don’t tell me...

01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:03.070
This is...

01:28:03.070 --> 01:28:04.550
Well then...

01:28:06.100 --> 01:28:07.460
Let’s put an end to you.

01:28:20.330 --> 01:28:24.140
Cloth out!

01:28:27.090 --> 01:28:29.110
How were you able to transform?

01:29:21.620 --> 01:29:23.160
Adios!

01:29:31.630 --> 01:29:33.480
Oh?

01:29:34.260 --> 01:29:37.600
You decided to show up after I completely beat you, Masked Pervert?

01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:40.540
Listen up, Fake Masked Pervert.

01:29:40.540 --> 01:29:43.390
I realized something very important.

01:29:43.390 --> 01:29:45.200
What’s that?

01:29:46.600 --> 01:29:52.240
There’s no rule says perversion defines your strength!

01:29:55.680 --> 01:29:58.180
So you noticed.

01:30:00.580 --> 01:30:02.420
You’re absolutely right.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:10.760
So I will fight with confidence, even though I am not as perverted as you!

01:30:12.970 --> 01:30:13.930
Very well.

01:32:42.940 --> 01:32:44.740
This ends now!

01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:53.960
Spinning Fire!

01:33:01.590 --> 01:33:02.720
Masked Pervert!

01:33:10.380 --> 01:33:15.400
This is the real...Spinning Fire!

01:33:24.870 --> 01:33:27.080
This fight is mine!

01:33:55.070 --> 01:33:56.860
The Masked Pervert!

01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:27.440
Aiko...

01:34:31.580 --> 01:34:32.910
That’s right...

01:34:36.100 --> 01:34:43.080
...The Masked Pervert...that’s me.

01:34:51.650 --> 01:34:53.140
Kyosuke?

01:34:56.010 --> 01:34:59.120
Indeed...I am The Masked Pervert.

01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:07.740
But...I...Kyosuke, am not a pervert.

01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:11.730
Please, believe me.

01:35:16.930 --> 01:35:20.310
Okay, I do.

01:35:31.110 --> 01:35:32.250
What was that?

01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:37.250
I have no choice.

01:35:38.050 --> 01:35:41.090
I’ll just destroy the school building!

01:36:06.980 --> 01:36:08.200
Are you okay?

01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:17.260
At this rate, the school will turn to dust.

01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:20.880
But...what can we do?

01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:29.050
Your...and my school...will turn to rubble.

01:36:43.450 --> 01:36:44.990
Aiko...

01:36:49.530 --> 01:37:01.870
Can I...have...your panties?

01:37:04.490 --> 01:37:05.880
What?

01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:10.630
In order to beat him, there’s no other way.

01:37:11.590 --> 01:37:13.680
But why?

01:37:14.220 --> 01:37:21.770
Because...I love you.

01:37:25.810 --> 01:37:29.300
If I wear the panties of the girl I love...

01:37:29.300 --> 01:37:31.740
...I should gain a power most unfathomable.

01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:40.030
But I’m embarrassed.

01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:44.720
It’s for the school.

01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:45.670
No...

01:37:46.290 --> 01:37:47.670
It’s for the world.

01:37:50.470 --> 01:37:59.260
Give me your...panties!

01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:05.440
Okay.

01:38:42.340 --> 01:38:47.310
Your name...is sewn on...

01:38:47.310 --> 01:38:50.640
D-Don’t look at them so carefully.

01:38:52.130 --> 01:38:53.590
I’ll win.

01:38:55.260 --> 01:38:59.490
I’ll definitely win!

01:38:59.490 --> 01:39:00.930
I know you will.

01:39:26.350 --> 01:39:27.810
Nooo… Not...

01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:34.230
There...

01:39:41.540 --> 01:39:43.950
Kyosuke!

01:40:08.100 --> 01:40:12.270
Hey, Kyosuke, let’s swim together.

01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:14.070
What?

01:40:14.070 --> 01:40:16.380
Please swim with me.

01:40:16.380 --> 01:40:18.200
Please, please, pretty please!

01:40:18.570 --> 01:40:20.080
Oh, dear.

01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:22.320
You’re so needy.

01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:25.660
Please, please, pretty please!

01:40:30.330 --> 01:40:31.710
Kyosuke...

01:40:34.820 --> 01:40:36.310
Hey, Kyosuke!

01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:37.840
Yes?

01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:40.090
What are you sleeping for?

01:40:40.090 --> 01:40:41.550
Read page 167!

01:40:42.630 --> 01:40:43.600
Okay!

01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:52.560
O-Oh my god, Kyosuke!

01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:54.420
No, that’s not it!

01:40:54.420 --> 01:40:56.320
It’s not what it looks like.

01:40:56.320 --> 01:40:57.450
Quiet everyone!

01:40:57.450 --> 01:40:58.420
Quiet!

01:40:58.420 --> 01:41:01.490
I’ll go get the nurse!

01:41:01.490 --> 01:41:02.160
Stay put!

01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:04.520
