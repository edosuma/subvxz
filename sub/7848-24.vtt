19:24.800 --> 19:26.200
YEAH. WE'RE
SO DISGUSTING,

19:26.200 --> 19:28.367
YOU MIGHT WANT TO MOVE
OUT OF STATE.

19:28.367 --> 19:31.367
HERE, LET ME GET
THE DOOR FOR YOU.

19:31.367 --> 19:34.100
UNLESS YOU PREFER
THE WINDOW.

19:34.100 --> 19:35.400
WAIT A MINUTE.

19:35.400 --> 19:38.033
ARE YOU TWO TRYING
TO GET RID OF ME?

19:38.033 --> 19:39.100
WELL...

19:39.100 --> 19:39.800
YES!

19:39.800 --> 19:41.800
WE'RE TRYING
TO SHOW YOU
HOW ANNOYING IT IS

19:41.800 --> 19:44.600
TO HAVE
SOMEONE WHO WON'T
LEAVE YOU ALONE.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.300
OH.

19:46.300 --> 19:47.300
I SEE.

19:47.300 --> 19:52.000
I DIDN'T REALIZE
I WAS BEING
SUCH A BOTHER.

19:53.734 --> 19:55.600
UH...AGNES...

19:55.600 --> 19:58.500
WHAT ZACK IS TRYING
TO SAY IS...

19:58.500 --> 20:00.400
YOU COME ON
A LITTLE TOO STRONG.

20:00.400 --> 20:03.367
NO...WHAT ZACK
IS <i>TRYING </i>TO SAY

20:03.367 --> 20:06.000
IS...LEAVE.

20:07.000 --> 20:07.834
THE POINT IS...

20:07.834 --> 20:10.400
YOU CAN'T FORCE
SOMEONE TO LIKE YOU.

20:10.400 --> 20:13.033
IT TAKES TIME
FOR A FRIENDSHIP TO GROW.

20:13.033 --> 20:16.233
YOU MEAN...IF
I HADN'T PUSHED
SO HARD,

20:16.233 --> 20:18.300
YOU WOULD'VE
LIKED ME?

20:19.100 --> 20:22.700
IT'S...POSSIBLE.

20:24.967 --> 20:26.934
THANKS FOR BEING
HONEST WITH ME, CODY.

20:26.934 --> 20:29.133
YOU'RE REALLY
A NICE GUY.

20:29.133 --> 20:31.200
SO I'VE BEEN TOLD.

20:31.200 --> 20:33.400
AND THAT'S WHY...

20:33.400 --> 20:35.200
I'LL WAIT FOR YOU.

20:35.200 --> 20:36.100
HUH?!

20:36.100 --> 20:38.100
SO YOU JUST
GO OUT THERE

20:38.100 --> 20:40.300
AND YOU SOW
YOUR WILD OATS.

20:40.300 --> 20:42.800
AND THEN...
WHEN YOU'RE READY...

20:42.800 --> 20:46.600
I'LL BE RIGHT OUT THERE
ON THAT SCAFFOLDING.

20:47.367 --> 20:49.834
BYE, CODYKINS.

20:49.834 --> 20:51.367
HMMH.

20:59.367 --> 21:01.367
I DID IT AGAIN, DIDN'T I?

21:01.367 --> 21:02.133
YEP.

21:02.133 --> 21:03.400
WHY, OH, WHY
WAS I CURSED

21:03.400 --> 21:06.567
WITH THIS INCREDIBLY KIND
AND GENTLE NATURE?

21:06.567 --> 21:10.934
YOU GOTTA STOP BEIN'
SUCH A PUSHOVER!
OK.

21:10.934 --> 21:14.233
NOW, GO DO MY HOMEWORK
LIKE YOU PROMISED.
OK.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.467
BUT YOU'RE ONLY
GETTING A "B."

21:18.467 --> 21:22.000
YES! MY FIRST "B"!

21:28.367 --> 21:29.600
I'M GOING TO NAME
MY PUPPY

21:29.600 --> 21:32.934
MARIA CONSUELO
MARGUERITA FRANCESCA
DEL CIELO.

21:32.934 --> 21:35.500
I THINK WE'LL NAME
THIS ONE SCRUFFY.

21:35.500 --> 21:37.367
YOU CALL <i>THOSE  </i>
NAMES?

21:37.367 --> 21:40.100
PRINCE PERCIVAL
PERSIMMON DU LAC.

21:40.100 --> 21:41.500
NOW, <i>THAT'S </i>A NAME.

21:41.500 --> 21:45.734
SURE...IF YOU WANT
HIM TO GET BEAT UP
AT THE DOG PARK.

21:45.734 --> 21:48.033
WHAT PART OF
"NO DOGS IN THE LOBBY"

21:48.033 --> 21:48.900
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?!

21:48.900 --> 21:52.934
NOW, WHOEVER'S FATHER
DOES NOT OWN THIS HOTEL
IS FIRED.

21:52.934 --> 21:56.600
