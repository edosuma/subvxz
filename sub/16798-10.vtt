WEBVTT

00:01.830 --> 00:03.231
Previously on Madam Secretary...

00:03.232 --> 00:06.868
We already needed an inside
straight to win this election

00:06.869 --> 00:09.137
in the House of
Representatives in two months.

00:09.138 --> 00:11.041
If Israel and Iran start
shooting at each other,

00:11.042 --> 00:11.907
we're done.

00:11.908 --> 00:13.875
And we will do what is necessary

00:13.876 --> 00:15.911
to defend ourselves.

00:15.912 --> 00:18.947
Can we convince both parties
to not escalate things further?

00:18.948 --> 00:20.982
Iran is already
planning countermeasures.

00:20.983 --> 00:24.286
Come back tomorrow
for the recommendation.

00:24.287 --> 00:26.688
The Iran deal is going to
define my administration.

00:26.689 --> 00:30.759
Just... not the way I hoped.

00:30.760 --> 00:32.761
If this is a bad time...

00:32.762 --> 00:36.563
Are you okay? Are you okay?

00:38.166 --> 00:40.602
Um, help! Adele!

00:40.603 --> 00:43.171
- Help.
- What is it? My God.

00:43.172 --> 00:44.705
- My God.
- Okay, breath.

00:45.874 --> 00:46.942
He's not breathing.

00:46.943 --> 00:49.062
- I need the medical units.
- There's no pulse.

00:49.063 --> 00:50.663
To Russell Jackson's office immediately.

00:50.687 --> 00:51.813
Okay... middle of the chest.

00:51.814 --> 00:53.048
100 compressions per minute.

00:53.049 --> 00:55.183
Two inches deep.

00:55.184 --> 00:56.451
- Come on.
- Is he breathing?

00:56.452 --> 00:57.986
Come on! Come on!

01:02.191 --> 01:04.733
- My God! What happened?
- Come on! Come on.

01:04.735 --> 01:06.598
It looks like a heart
attack. I called medical.

01:06.599 --> 01:08.720
- Is he breathing?
- No. I don't think so.

01:08.721 --> 01:10.586
I-I came to get my
recommendation letter

01:10.587 --> 01:11.887
- and-and he just collapsed.
- Okay, okay.

01:11.888 --> 01:13.022
Baby, you're doing
great, you're doing great.

01:13.023 --> 01:14.500
M-m-make sure his airway's clear.

01:14.501 --> 01:15.177
My God.

01:15.202 --> 01:17.203
He's in here. It's in his office.

01:17.204 --> 01:18.704
Ma'am, step aside.

01:18.705 --> 01:21.445
- Step aside, ma'am.
- Come here, baby. Come on, come on, come on.

01:22.408 --> 01:24.143
It's okay, it's okay.

01:24.144 --> 01:26.012
All right, no pulse.

01:26.013 --> 01:28.280
No breathing.

01:34.353 --> 01:35.954
I'm gonna defib.

01:42.228 --> 01:44.330
And clear!

01:47.333 --> 01:50.503
Come on, Russell. Come on, man!

01:50.504 --> 01:51.838
We got an arrest here.

01:51.839 --> 01:54.105
We got to get him on the cot fast.

01:56.843 --> 02:00.078
One, two, three.

02:00.880 --> 02:04.484
Okay. It's gonna be fine.

02:04.485 --> 02:06.085
It's okay.

02:06.086 --> 02:08.287
Thank God he wasn't alone, baby.

02:08.288 --> 02:09.521
It's hard to see that.

02:09.523 --> 02:11.457
You did really good... yeah.

02:11.458 --> 02:13.018
- I better call Carol.
- Yeah.

02:13.019 --> 02:14.752
Mr. President, Madam
Secretary, I'm sorry,

02:14.753 --> 02:16.073
but Admiral Hill needs to see you

02:16.097 --> 02:17.588
urgently.

02:17.589 --> 02:18.972
- I'm fine, I'm fine.
- Go, go, go.

02:18.973 --> 02:20.024
I'll call Carol, sir.

02:20.025 --> 02:21.786
And I want real-time
updates on his condition

02:21.787 --> 02:23.450
- no matter how small.
- Go straight home.

02:24.229 --> 02:25.462
What is it?

02:25.463 --> 02:27.932
- Is Russell gonna be okay?
- Yeah. What's going on?

02:27.933 --> 02:30.801
CENTCOM is reporting that
about five minutes ago

02:30.802 --> 02:33.470
Iran launched Shahab missiles

02:33.471 --> 02:35.773
at Israel's Zahavi nuclear facility.

02:35.774 --> 02:37.775
Did any of them get through?

02:37.776 --> 02:39.743
All were intercepted by Arrow Three,

02:39.744 --> 02:42.279
but one was only partially destroyed,

02:42.280 --> 02:44.381
and struck the facility.

02:44.382 --> 02:45.749
That's a massive escalation.

02:45.750 --> 02:48.852
They have to know the Israelis
are just gonna hit right back.

02:48.853 --> 02:49.987
Thank you, Ellen.

02:49.988 --> 02:52.289
Keep me apprised of damage assessments.

02:52.290 --> 02:53.457
Of course, Mr. President.

02:53.458 --> 02:56.559
I'll be praying for Russell.

02:57.661 --> 02:59.430
I'm gonna reach out to the Israelis.

02:59.431 --> 03:00.664
Yeah.

03:00.665 --> 03:03.300
I'll call Shiraz.

03:03.301 --> 03:06.337
Conrad, I-I can deal with him, too.

03:06.338 --> 03:07.671
Mr. President,

03:07.672 --> 03:09.895
I know the campaign must be
the last thing on your mind,

03:09.896 --> 03:11.375
but Taylor Wilson needs a minute.

03:11.376 --> 03:13.444
Says it's important.

03:13.445 --> 03:14.445
Send her in.

03:14.446 --> 03:16.013
And get me President Shiraz.

03:16.014 --> 03:17.247
Yes, sir.

03:17.248 --> 03:19.516
If you wouldn't mind staying, Bess.

03:19.517 --> 03:22.686
Of course.

03:22.687 --> 03:25.422
Mr. President, Madam Secretary.

03:25.423 --> 03:27.157
Sorry to both you about the election.

03:27.158 --> 03:28.726
Normally, I would go to Mr. Jackson...

03:28.727 --> 03:30.027
It's all right. What is it?

03:30.028 --> 03:32.429
House leadership just
pushed through a rule

03:32.430 --> 03:33.864
to move its vote for president

03:33.865 --> 03:36.700
up from January 6th to next week

03:36.701 --> 03:39.436
- in the lame duck session.
- On what grounds?

03:39.437 --> 03:41.505
They say with all the
current instability,

03:41.506 --> 03:44.641
we need presidential certainty.

03:44.642 --> 03:45.943
Not a bad point.

03:45.944 --> 03:47.711
I recommend

03:47.712 --> 03:49.975
that we immediately file a
lawsuit to challenge the rule.

03:49.976 --> 03:53.484
White House Counsel thinks we
have a decent chance of winning.

03:53.485 --> 03:56.519
Otherwise, Evans will win
the election next week.

03:58.155 --> 03:59.156
Bess?

03:59.157 --> 04:01.792
Well, they're taking the election

04:01.793 --> 04:03.394
away from the new Congress.

04:03.395 --> 04:05.729
We have a legitimate fight.

04:05.730 --> 04:08.532
I have President Shiraz for you, sir.

04:08.533 --> 04:09.733
Thank you.

04:09.734 --> 04:13.604
I agree that we have a strong argument.

04:13.605 --> 04:15.339
And I would love to fight this,

04:15.340 --> 04:16.660
but I've already upset the system

04:16.684 --> 04:17.875
by running as an Independent.

04:17.875 --> 04:20.043
Is it really best for the country

04:20.045 --> 04:21.810
to get the courts involved now?

04:22.813 --> 04:24.314
I respect the House's

04:24.315 --> 04:25.816
constitutional prerogative on this.

04:25.817 --> 04:27.316
The answer is no.

04:28.619 --> 04:32.155
Thank you, Mr. President.

04:33.957 --> 04:36.360
Thank you, Bess.

04:36.361 --> 04:40.497
Let's just... keep doing
our jobs while we have them.

04:40.498 --> 04:41.698
Yes, sir.

04:41.699 --> 04:44.902
I'll call Prime Minister
Aaronson right away.

04:44.903 --> 04:47.771
President Shiraz...

04:47.772 --> 04:49.873
I just heard about your
ill-conceived attack

04:49.874 --> 04:53.010
on Israel's Zahavi nuclear facility.

04:54.412 --> 04:57.748
Ma'am, Russell
Jackson has stabilized.

04:57.749 --> 04:59.416
Thank God.

04:59.417 --> 05:00.350
Well, he's on his way

05:00.351 --> 05:01.585
into bypass surgery,

05:01.586 --> 05:03.387
so we're not completely
out of the woods.

05:03.388 --> 05:05.722
God. Is the Israeli ambassador here yet?

05:05.723 --> 05:07.203
Yes, ma'am, he's waiting for you.

05:07.227 --> 05:08.125
Excuse me.

05:08.126 --> 05:09.326
The Israelis are reporting

05:09.327 --> 05:10.727
five dead at Zahavi.

05:10.728 --> 05:13.530
Prime Minister Aaronson just told me.

05:13.531 --> 05:17.067
In between vows to end the Iran threat

05:17.068 --> 05:18.969
once and for all.

05:18.970 --> 05:20.471
- That's terrifying.
- Yes.

05:20.472 --> 05:22.615
- What do you want me to tell the gaggle?
- The truth.

05:22.616 --> 05:25.742
The U.S. is deeply concerned
about an escalating conflict

05:25.743 --> 05:29.345
that will not end well for
either side or the world.

05:30.481 --> 05:32.950
Ambassador Dori, thank you for coming.

05:32.951 --> 05:34.485
I understand you've already talked

05:34.486 --> 05:35.919
to Prime Minister Aaronson.

05:35.920 --> 05:37.054
Yes.

05:37.055 --> 05:39.923
And I need you to
convince him to stand down.

05:39.924 --> 05:41.925
And why would I do that?

05:41.926 --> 05:44.228
When five Israelis were just
murdered by Iranian missiles?

05:44.229 --> 05:46.530
Because as the former head of Mossad

05:46.531 --> 05:48.866
you understand that an all-out war

05:48.867 --> 05:51.401
with Iran and their
half-million-strong army

05:51.402 --> 05:53.036
will threaten your existence.

05:53.037 --> 05:55.706
Iran doesn't acknowledge
our right to exist.

05:55.707 --> 05:59.543
Which we strongly disagree with.

05:59.544 --> 06:03.714
But if Iran threatens
Tel Aviv, or Jerusalem,

06:03.715 --> 06:05.649
you could be forced to go nuclear,

06:05.650 --> 06:07.618
and if that happens, God help us all.

06:07.619 --> 06:10.020
You should have listened to the elements

06:10.021 --> 06:11.722
in your government who understood

06:11.723 --> 06:13.390
that Iran could never be trusted.

06:13.391 --> 06:15.259
Your deceased CIA director

06:15.260 --> 06:17.127
and that-that woman
in prison, they knew,

06:17.128 --> 06:19.730
but you and Dalton chose not to listen.

06:19.731 --> 06:21.331
Lior, you have the prime minister's ear.

06:21.355 --> 06:22.299
I need you to get him

06:22.300 --> 06:23.700
to stop this madness... I'm sorry,

06:23.724 --> 06:25.869
is there somewhere more
important you need to be?

06:27.238 --> 06:29.139
You are about to get news

06:29.140 --> 06:31.141
that Ebrahim Air Base
has been destroyed.

06:31.142 --> 06:33.577
Iran won't be launching missiles

06:33.578 --> 06:35.012
at us from there anymore.

06:35.013 --> 06:38.881
They will feel our existence now.

06:41.753 --> 06:45.689
Ma'am, we just got word
that Israel launched

06:45.690 --> 06:47.958
- an attack inside Iran.
- I need you to get the president for me.

06:47.959 --> 06:49.279
Actually, his office just called.

06:49.303 --> 06:51.161
He would like you to
meet him at the hospital.

06:52.730 --> 06:56.567
Russell's still in surgery,
but Carol's up there.

06:56.568 --> 07:00.003
Some stunt by the Israeli ambassador.

07:00.004 --> 07:02.706
Yeah. Initial reports out of Tehran

07:02.707 --> 07:04.241
are more than 200 dead.

07:04.242 --> 07:05.309
This thing's spiraling,

07:05.310 --> 07:08.045
and diplomacy clearly isn't working.

07:08.046 --> 07:09.913
We could try to get between them.

07:09.914 --> 07:11.715
I just ordered three
carrier strike groups

07:11.716 --> 07:14.818
from the Fifth Fleet
to the Persian Gulf.

07:14.819 --> 07:18.155
Should make the Iranians
think twice before retaliating.

07:18.156 --> 07:20.090
Okay. Thank you for the update. Carol.

07:20.091 --> 07:21.592
Thank you for coming.

07:21.593 --> 07:23.493
Goodness.

07:23.494 --> 07:25.462
- Hi.
- How is he doing?

07:25.463 --> 07:28.498
Well, the EMTs restored
his spontaneous circulation,

07:28.499 --> 07:30.067
and the bypass surgery

07:30.068 --> 07:31.468
has been pretty textbook so far.

07:31.469 --> 07:32.836
Thank God. Good.

07:32.837 --> 07:34.204
Well, I'm just sorry if I've

07:34.205 --> 07:35.908
put undue strain on
him the last few years.

07:35.909 --> 07:37.040
Are you kidding me?

07:37.041 --> 07:38.342
He's never been happier,

07:38.343 --> 07:40.210
and stress didn't clog his arteries.

07:40.211 --> 07:41.954
He thinks I don't know
he cheats on his diet

07:41.955 --> 07:42.980
when he comes home

07:42.981 --> 07:44.281
wreaking of pÃ¢tÃ©.

07:44.282 --> 07:45.549
- Hi. Hey.
- Hi.

07:45.550 --> 07:46.683
How's he doing?

07:46.684 --> 07:49.086
- Okay so far.
- Thank God.

07:49.087 --> 07:51.030
I don't think you've met
our daughter, Stephanie.

07:51.031 --> 07:52.823
- Hi.
- No. But I'm,

07:52.824 --> 07:54.291
I'm very glad to now.

07:54.292 --> 07:56.727
The doctors told me that you
started chest compressions

07:56.728 --> 07:59.062
before the medical staff arrived.

07:59.063 --> 08:02.199
Yeah, just, like, for-for a minute.

08:02.200 --> 08:04.534
Thank you.

08:06.537 --> 08:09.273
Listen, we'll-we'll
leave you, go up and...

08:09.274 --> 08:10.340
- Thank you.
- Gosh.

08:10.341 --> 08:11.475
Good to see you.

08:11.476 --> 08:12.843
- Say hi to him.
- I will.

08:12.844 --> 08:13.877
- Conrad.
- See you soon.

08:13.878 --> 08:17.113
Bye.

08:19.349 --> 08:21.184
Do you know how proud

08:21.185 --> 08:22.408
- we are of you?
- My God.

08:22.409 --> 08:25.055
- To stay so calm under pressure.
- Mom... okay, thank you.

08:25.056 --> 08:27.057
I'm, I'm gonna call Jareth.

08:27.058 --> 08:28.692
- Okay.
- I need to update him.

08:28.693 --> 08:30.793
- See you at home, maybe, later.
- Bye.

08:33.063 --> 08:35.532
Look, I'm gonna cancel this
whole 10K thing on Sunday.

08:35.533 --> 08:37.034
Shane and Sarah can't make it?

08:37.034 --> 08:38.769
No. But with everything that's going on,

08:38.770 --> 08:40.703
the last thing we need
is a house full of people.

08:40.705 --> 08:43.006
Babe, no. Family first.

08:43.006 --> 08:45.776
I know how much you've
been looking forward

08:45.777 --> 08:47.511
to kicking your little brother's ass

08:47.512 --> 08:48.745
and everybody else's.

08:48.746 --> 08:50.080
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

08:50.081 --> 08:52.916
And it's a charity run, and
I roped my staff into it,

08:52.917 --> 08:55.752
and so there's lots of other
asses that need kicking.

08:55.753 --> 08:56.953
Okay, then.

08:56.954 --> 08:58.188
You got to go back to work?

08:58.189 --> 08:59.688
Yep.

09:02.526 --> 09:04.127
Babe, you okay?

09:04.128 --> 09:05.694
What is it?

09:06.830 --> 09:09.066
I just met with the Israeli ambassador

09:09.067 --> 09:11.535
and he made a point that
Munsey and Juliet knew

09:11.536 --> 09:13.537
that the Iran deal would never work.

09:13.538 --> 09:15.539
That's a cheap shot.

09:15.540 --> 09:17.074
No one could have predicted all this.

09:17.075 --> 09:19.810
They believed it would lead
to an existential threat

09:19.811 --> 09:21.914
to the world, and what if
everything that they feared

09:21.915 --> 09:25.449
is coming true now?

09:27.000 --> 09:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:03.588 --> 10:06.188
Hello.

10:07.491 --> 10:11.461
Okay. I'll be right there.

10:13.197 --> 10:15.198
Is it about Russell?

10:15.199 --> 10:19.202
No. Iran.

10:19.203 --> 10:22.005
They just kidnapped
Israel's defense minister.

10:22.006 --> 10:23.507
President Shiraz,

10:23.508 --> 10:25.308
are you out of your mind?

10:25.309 --> 10:27.477
Have you seen the
destruction at Ebrahim?

10:27.478 --> 10:29.713
Kidnapping, an-an Israeli minister,

10:29.714 --> 10:31.314
it's, it's unprecedented.

10:31.315 --> 10:32.582
We know the Hezbollah faction

10:32.583 --> 10:33.784
that took Minister Weissberg

10:33.785 --> 10:34.885
was working for you.

10:34.886 --> 10:36.787
And they will kill him
if I give the order.

10:36.788 --> 10:38.789
If you did that, I assure you

10:38.790 --> 10:40.524
there would be know coming back from

10:40.525 --> 10:41.658
the hell you would unleash!

10:41.659 --> 10:43.362
Then you should advise
your Israeli friends

10:43.363 --> 10:45.562
not to take any further
action against us!

10:45.563 --> 10:48.231
They're mobilizing for war.

10:48.232 --> 10:50.100
You need to release Minister Weissberg

10:50.101 --> 10:52.502
- immediately!
- Israel attacked us first.

10:52.503 --> 10:54.370
A suicide mission is
not defending yourself.

10:58.209 --> 11:01.044
He's boxed himself into a corner.

11:01.045 --> 11:03.980
I guarantee you the Israelis
are all over Lebanon right now,

11:03.981 --> 11:05.215
looking for Weissberg.

11:05.216 --> 11:06.616
Well, maybe we should be, too.

11:06.617 --> 11:08.018
We have assets in country.

11:08.019 --> 11:09.352
Plus the Sixth Fleet nearby.

11:09.353 --> 11:11.288
- Get into it.
- Yes, sir.

11:11.289 --> 11:15.025
If we get to Weissberg first,
it'll give us some leverage.

11:15.026 --> 11:17.326
And if the Israelis do?

11:29.779 --> 11:31.547
Thank you, Matt.

11:31.548 --> 11:35.521
Hey, is that bacon?

11:35.522 --> 11:37.260
There better be some left for me.

11:37.261 --> 11:38.360
Better hurry!

11:38.361 --> 11:40.429
I see more McCords.

11:40.430 --> 11:41.630
My God!

11:41.631 --> 11:43.499
- Hi!
- Hi.

11:43.500 --> 11:44.667
How was the drive?

11:44.668 --> 11:46.635
Really early. Yeah.

11:46.636 --> 11:48.571
Like you wanted
to sit in D.C. traffic.

11:48.572 --> 11:50.106
Yeah, McCord brothers.

11:50.107 --> 11:52.308
Wouldn't do ten more
minutes on the road.

11:52.309 --> 11:54.092
- My goodness. Gosh.
- You like that?

11:54.093 --> 11:55.211
- Okay.
- How are you?

11:55.212 --> 11:56.545
- All right. Okay.
- How are you?

11:56.546 --> 11:57.813
- Good.
- So great to be here.

11:57.814 --> 11:59.949
I'm so sorry I wasn't
here to greet you, but...

11:59.950 --> 12:01.517
- It's okay. - Gosh.
- You kidding?

12:01.518 --> 12:03.741
With everything going on,
I'm surprised you're here now.

12:03.742 --> 12:05.020
Girl's got to eat.

12:05.021 --> 12:06.755
And I wanted to warn you

12:06.756 --> 12:08.824
that Henry is out for bragging rights.

12:10.026 --> 12:11.994
You don't have to worry
about Dad, Uncle Henry.

12:11.995 --> 12:14.697
He hasn't exactly been training. At all.

12:15.932 --> 12:17.366
Yeah? Yeah?

12:17.367 --> 12:19.902
Well, not everybody
can drop out of college,

12:19.903 --> 12:22.246
enlist in the Army and get in
the best shape of their lives

12:22.247 --> 12:23.105
like Sarah did.

12:23.106 --> 12:24.607
Wait. What?!

12:24.608 --> 12:25.975
The Army?

12:25.976 --> 12:27.243
- Dropped of school? What do you mean?
- Wow.

12:27.244 --> 12:29.078
What, what's wrong with the Marines?

12:29.079 --> 12:31.147
Okay, I'm going to
finish college eventually.

12:31.148 --> 12:34.250
I totally get it. I've
been there, done that, cuz.

12:34.251 --> 12:35.784
It just wasn't clicking, you know?

12:35.785 --> 12:38.146
Like, all these classes, but
nothing I was passionate about.

12:38.147 --> 12:40.250
Are you saying school's not
supposed to be like that?

12:40.251 --> 12:41.123
Good for you, Sarah.

12:41.124 --> 12:42.404
Serving your country's an honor.

12:42.428 --> 12:43.961
- Seriously.
- Thank you. - Yeah.

12:46.262 --> 12:47.863
- You look amazing, by the way.
- Thanks.

12:47.864 --> 12:49.632
I mean, seriously, you
have to let me style you.

12:49.633 --> 12:50.993
I've seen your YouTube videos.

12:50.994 --> 12:52.362
So you know I know what I'm doing.

12:52.363 --> 12:53.469
Yeah.

12:53.470 --> 12:55.271
- Take this.
- Okay.

12:55.272 --> 12:57.173
Which one was your favorite?

12:57.174 --> 12:59.037
Um, I liked the one where you sort of...

12:59.038 --> 13:00.109
Sarah seems great.

13:00.110 --> 13:01.310
Your kids, too.

13:01.311 --> 13:02.745
The girls are amazing,

13:02.746 --> 13:04.847
and Jason's basically
you in high school.

13:04.848 --> 13:07.283
Snarky, disrespectful
little pain in the...

13:07.284 --> 13:08.817
Payback's a bitch, brother.

13:13.122 --> 13:15.791
So, listen, I'm... concerned

13:15.792 --> 13:17.927
about Sarah and this whole Army thing.

13:17.928 --> 13:19.728
Yeah, I was kind of getting that.

13:19.729 --> 13:21.997
I just think she's making a big decision

13:21.998 --> 13:23.299
for all the wrong reasons.

13:23.300 --> 13:24.767
What she didn't tell you is

13:24.768 --> 13:25.935
that she just broke up

13:25.936 --> 13:27.136
with her boyfriend Charlie

13:27.137 --> 13:28.370
a couple weeks ago.

13:28.371 --> 13:29.905
That's too bad.

13:29.906 --> 13:32.308
She fell pretty hard, got into a funk,

13:32.309 --> 13:33.492
started messing up in school,

13:33.493 --> 13:36.879
and then, suddenly decides to enlist.

13:36.880 --> 13:39.615
Yeah, well, that
doesn't necessarily mean

13:39.616 --> 13:41.550
it's a bad decision.

13:41.551 --> 13:44.220
I know.

13:44.221 --> 13:46.789
I just...

13:46.790 --> 13:49.158
I'm worried that she doesn't
know what she's getting into.

13:49.159 --> 13:51.694
Listen, she doesn't officially

13:51.695 --> 13:54.330
sign on the dotted line until next week.

13:54.331 --> 13:57.833
Can you talk to her, tell
her what it's really like?

13:57.834 --> 14:00.102
Okay.

14:00.103 --> 14:02.571
Sure, but I'm not gonna
try to talk her out of it.

14:02.572 --> 14:04.740
Just about it.

14:04.741 --> 14:06.408
It's all I ask.

14:06.409 --> 14:08.644
I really appreciate it.

14:08.645 --> 14:10.312
CIA has

14:10.313 --> 14:13.382
credible intel that
Minister Weissberg was taken

14:13.383 --> 14:15.384
by tunnel into Yaroun,

14:15.385 --> 14:17.620
and then driven to the Baalbek District.

14:17.621 --> 14:19.455
We're focusing our search there.

14:19.456 --> 14:21.257
That's quick work.

14:21.258 --> 14:23.792
- But the Baalbek District... it looks...
- Huge.

14:23.793 --> 14:25.828
Almost 900 square miles.

14:25.829 --> 14:28.797
The Israelis aren't going
to stand down forever.

14:28.798 --> 14:30.432
Thanks, Ephraim.

14:30.433 --> 14:32.001
We'll stay on it, sir.

14:32.002 --> 14:33.302
Madam Secretary.

14:35.005 --> 14:36.438
Sir, Taylor Wilson?

14:36.439 --> 14:38.607
Okay.

14:38.608 --> 14:40.309
I'm still not filing a lawsuit.

14:40.310 --> 14:42.144
Understood, sir.

14:42.145 --> 14:44.146
But I'd be remiss if I didn't tell you

14:44.147 --> 14:46.015
you have one more card to play.

14:46.016 --> 14:49.084
Several months ago, the campaign
received an anonymous mailing

14:49.085 --> 14:52.054
containing Governor Evans'
genetic testing report.

14:52.055 --> 14:54.290
Now, Russell and I
knew you'd balk at it,

14:54.291 --> 14:56.759
but given where we are...

14:56.760 --> 14:59.795
It shows that Evans has the PSEN1 gene,

14:59.796 --> 15:01.263
meaning he has a high risk

15:01.264 --> 15:03.599
of developing early-onset Alzheimer's.

15:03.600 --> 15:07.403
We confirmed with the lab
that the result is authentic.

15:07.404 --> 15:11.273
Not exactly how I wanted to win.

15:11.274 --> 15:12.908
Well, I know, sir, but

15:12.909 --> 15:14.643
the public deserves to know.

15:14.644 --> 15:17.479
And at this point, it may
be our only plausible path.

15:17.480 --> 15:19.581
I think we all know
what Russell would say.

15:19.582 --> 15:20.983
Excuse me, sir.

15:20.984 --> 15:22.451
Sorry to interrupt,

15:22.452 --> 15:24.353
but CENTCOM has picked
up Israeli fighter jets

15:24.354 --> 15:26.455
headed toward Iranian airspace.

15:26.456 --> 15:28.724
Any idea what their target is?

15:28.725 --> 15:30.788
Back channels are saying
the Parsa Nuclear facility.

15:30.789 --> 15:31.794
My God.

15:31.795 --> 15:33.095
The fallout will last

15:33.096 --> 15:36.031
for decades, if not centuries.

15:36.032 --> 15:38.766
The Iranians will counter
with everything they've got.

15:45.972 --> 15:48.274
How long until IDF jets reach Parsa?

15:48.275 --> 15:50.643
17 minutes, sir. They just
crossed the Iraq-Syria border.

15:50.644 --> 15:52.479
Any luck reaching out to Jerusalem?

15:52.480 --> 15:54.948
No, ma'am. There's a total
communications blackout.

15:54.949 --> 15:58.512
Mr. President, CIA assets
inside Lebanon believe

15:58.513 --> 16:01.782
they've located Israeli
Defense Minister Weissberg.

16:01.783 --> 16:04.785
He's being held at a private
compound in Deir El Ahmar.

16:04.786 --> 16:07.054
How the hell do we let the Israelis know

16:07.055 --> 16:08.388
in the next 17 minutes?

16:08.389 --> 16:09.690
We can't, sir.

16:09.691 --> 16:12.592
And if they hit Parsa, it won't matter.

16:12.593 --> 16:14.528
How do we buy some time?

16:14.529 --> 16:16.663
Israeli jets can't hit their targets

16:16.664 --> 16:18.598
without global positioning.

16:18.599 --> 16:20.667
It's messy, but...

16:20.668 --> 16:24.470
we could knock out their
satellite with an SM-3.

16:26.506 --> 16:28.575
That would be an act of war.

16:28.576 --> 16:30.177
To stop a bigger war.

16:30.178 --> 16:34.081
Israel would never retaliate against us.

16:34.082 --> 16:35.816
I'm not willing

16:35.817 --> 16:38.051
to completely destroy our
relationship with Israel.

16:38.052 --> 16:40.520
But I like your thinking,
Ellen. What else?

16:40.521 --> 16:42.622
What about doing the
same thing with cyber?

16:42.623 --> 16:45.926
Muckware. I mean, can it neutralize.

16:45.927 --> 16:47.127
Israel's satellite?

16:47.128 --> 16:49.089
We created it with the
Israelis, so they'd be able

16:49.090 --> 16:51.473
to clean it up pretty quickly,
but it might buy us 24 hours.

16:51.474 --> 16:53.667
Enough time to get their hostage back

16:53.668 --> 16:56.136
and possibly end this crisis.

16:56.137 --> 16:57.617
It's cyber, but technically speaking,

16:57.641 --> 16:58.905
it's still an act of war.

16:58.906 --> 17:01.908
One I can live with. Do it, General.

17:01.909 --> 17:04.211
Admiral Parker, do we have

17:04.212 --> 17:06.445
enough assets nearby
to put together a raid

17:06.446 --> 17:07.614
on Deir El Ahmar?

17:07.615 --> 17:09.316
We can have a SEAL team spin up

17:09.317 --> 17:10.817
from Carrier Group 2 pretty quick.

17:10.818 --> 17:12.685
- Get 'em ready.
- Sir.

17:16.223 --> 17:18.290
So, exciting time for you?

17:18.291 --> 17:21.862
He asked you to talk me out
of joining the Army, didn't he?

17:21.863 --> 17:24.097
You might want to consider
military intelligence.

17:25.333 --> 17:27.000
Nah, he just wants what's best for you.

17:27.001 --> 17:29.144
Make sure you understand
the commitment you're making,

17:29.145 --> 17:31.972
especially considering what's
going on in the world right now.

17:33.741 --> 17:36.410
If you're really interested,
I already took my ASVAB,

17:36.411 --> 17:39.713
and I made the cut as
a nursing specialist.

17:39.714 --> 17:42.883
I'm gonna go get my 68C
primary training down in Houston

17:42.884 --> 17:46.953
before starting second,
the phase two training.

17:46.954 --> 17:50.490
And then, I'm gonna take the
NCLEX-PN to be a licensed nurse.

17:50.491 --> 17:52.325
OMG. That's a lot of letters.

17:52.326 --> 17:54.494
I just joined,

17:54.495 --> 17:58.231
to get away from my dad.

17:58.232 --> 18:00.500
Yeah, well, there's that, too.

18:05.472 --> 18:07.773
He lost his job back in June.

18:08.508 --> 18:10.510
What?

18:10.511 --> 18:12.179
What happened?

18:12.180 --> 18:15.082
He showed up to a
sales call drunk, and...

18:15.083 --> 18:17.783
he made me promise I wouldn't tell you.

18:18.785 --> 18:20.754
Has been drinking a lot?

18:20.755 --> 18:22.756
No. No, it's...

18:22.757 --> 18:24.491
It's not so much that.

18:24.492 --> 18:26.827
It's more like...

18:26.828 --> 18:28.795
ever since Grandpa died,

18:28.796 --> 18:32.666
he's just... kind of lost
interest in everything.

18:35.002 --> 18:37.170
- So is he looking for another job?
- No...

18:37.171 --> 18:40.040
He's just basically been sitting home,

18:40.041 --> 18:42.909
doing nothing, and
I'm worried about him.

18:44.812 --> 18:50.216
Is it wrong for me to want
to go away and have a life?

18:52.752 --> 18:55.054
No, not at all.

18:57.457 --> 18:59.526
"Secrecy did pay off for Patton

18:59.527 --> 19:02.496
"in that the western
task force had succeeded

19:02.497 --> 19:04.231
"in sneaking up the coast

19:04.232 --> 19:06.666
"totally unexpected and unobserved.

19:06.667 --> 19:10.337
"But, as Morrison put
it, 'By a curious paradox,

19:10.338 --> 19:14.574
"'the efforts of the Allied
armed forces to maintain secrecy

19:14.575 --> 19:16.877
"'probably lost
whatever chance there was

19:16.878 --> 19:19.846
of an unopposed landing in Morocco.'"

19:26.753 --> 19:29.956
Where's my phone?

19:29.957 --> 19:31.925
Hey there.

19:34.262 --> 19:36.329
What the hell?

19:36.330 --> 19:38.732
Carol...

19:38.733 --> 19:41.701
she... she went to get coffee, and also,

19:41.702 --> 19:44.204
to call your son again.

19:44.205 --> 19:47.541
She was reading this... to you.

19:47.542 --> 19:50.510
Um, she said it's your favorite,

19:50.511 --> 19:52.579
which doesn't explain
why I'm here, but...

19:52.580 --> 19:55.982
Iran... and Israel.

19:55.983 --> 19:57.717
What's going on?

19:59.353 --> 20:01.354
She...

20:01.355 --> 20:05.025
she insisted on a total media blackout,

20:05.026 --> 20:06.826
- so...
- Of course.

20:06.827 --> 20:08.995
But we're just talking.

20:08.996 --> 20:11.064
Casually.

20:11.065 --> 20:13.033
About Iran and Israel.

20:13.034 --> 20:15.535
Speak!

20:15.536 --> 20:18.171
Sure, okay.

20:18.172 --> 20:19.839
Let's see.

20:19.840 --> 20:22.209
Iran launched missiles at Israel,

20:22.210 --> 20:26.413
so Israel destroyed Iran's base.

20:26.414 --> 20:30.984
Then Iran kidnapped, um,
Israel's Defense Minister.

20:30.985 --> 20:34.955
What about the election?

20:34.956 --> 20:37.624
The vote in the House

20:37.625 --> 20:40.893
is next week, so...

20:43.563 --> 20:45.465
It's January?! What...?

20:45.466 --> 20:47.667
- How long have I been asleep?
- No, no.

20:47.668 --> 20:50.103
Um, the House decided to move it up.

20:50.104 --> 20:52.172
Give me your phone.

20:52.173 --> 20:53.273
Give me your phone.

20:53.274 --> 20:55.041
- Give me your phone.
- You should...

20:55.042 --> 20:57.344
You should really...
You should really relax.

20:57.345 --> 20:58.645
Listen to me.

20:58.646 --> 21:00.714
The future of the world is at stake.

21:00.715 --> 21:01.948
I need you to call

21:01.949 --> 21:03.116
the White House.

21:03.117 --> 21:04.751
You really need to talk to...

21:04.752 --> 21:07.621
No, I need to talk... speak to the pr..

21:07.622 --> 21:09.522
I need...

21:09.523 --> 21:12.859
to talk to the president, and
you need to get him for me.

21:12.860 --> 21:14.793
Do you understand?

21:18.031 --> 21:22.202
Israeli jets are
approaching Iranian airspace.

21:22.203 --> 21:24.137
Only minutes out of
Parsa... what's going on?

21:24.138 --> 21:26.273
CYBERCOM is still activating
the virus. Almost there.

21:26.274 --> 21:27.607
They better finish soon,

21:27.608 --> 21:28.642
or it'll be too late...

21:28.643 --> 21:30.303
we'll have attacked an ally for nothing.

21:31.611 --> 21:34.047
Israeli jets have
breached Iranian airspace.

21:34.048 --> 21:35.382
Damn it.

21:35.383 --> 21:38.285
Activation complete.

21:38.286 --> 21:40.586
Israeli's nav satellite is offline.

21:44.090 --> 21:45.859
They're turning back.

21:45.860 --> 21:48.193
Any ordnance dropped?

21:50.130 --> 21:51.897
Negative, sir.

21:53.400 --> 21:56.536
Well, the Israelis are
gonna want an explanation

21:56.537 --> 21:59.673
as to why their closest ally
just cyber-attacked them.

21:59.674 --> 22:02.475
Rescuing their defense
minister would go a long way

22:02.476 --> 22:04.010
towards repairing relations.

22:35.608 --> 22:38.211
No sign of the package.

22:38.212 --> 22:40.246
Could our intel have been faulty?

22:40.247 --> 22:41.947
Or they could have moved him.

22:45.251 --> 22:46.920
Is that him?

22:46.921 --> 22:48.922
We need a better look, Chief.

22:48.923 --> 22:51.223
Copy. Coming closer.

22:54.761 --> 22:57.763
- Put up a photo of Minister Weissberg.
- Yes, sir.

23:01.868 --> 23:03.570
That's him.

23:03.571 --> 23:05.737
It's Weissberg.

23:07.407 --> 23:09.509
Orion ready to breach. Over.

23:09.510 --> 23:10.876
Copy, Orion.

23:12.011 --> 23:14.413
On your command, Mr. President.

23:24.758 --> 23:26.760
Tell them to stand by, Admiral,

23:26.761 --> 23:28.027
and mute comms.

23:28.028 --> 23:29.896
Stand by, Orion.

23:29.897 --> 23:31.630
Copy.

23:35.935 --> 23:37.737
Yes, Mr. President?

23:37.738 --> 23:40.206
Best estimate on losses in a raid.

23:40.207 --> 23:43.041
Three to seven men, sir.

23:44.210 --> 23:47.180
Odds of taking the hostage alive?

23:47.181 --> 23:48.914
50 percent.

23:54.020 --> 23:55.020
_ _

24:00.172 --> 24:01.738
Yes, sir.

24:05.276 --> 24:06.945
President Shiraz.

24:06.946 --> 24:08.293
You're probably wondering

24:08.294 --> 24:09.893
why your Parsa nuclear facility

24:09.894 --> 24:12.295
isn't a smoldering ember right now.

24:12.296 --> 24:15.098
It's because the United
States, at great risk,

24:15.099 --> 24:17.501
took offensive measures against Israel.

24:17.502 --> 24:20.704
Now I need something from you in return.

24:20.705 --> 24:22.906
U.S. military personnel are outside

24:22.907 --> 24:25.442
the compound in Deir El Ahmar,
where your soldiers are holding.

24:25.443 --> 24:26.676
Minister Weissberg.

24:26.677 --> 24:28.145
We can go in

24:28.146 --> 24:30.814
and kill your men, and risk
the life of the hostage,

24:30.815 --> 24:33.049
which would be very bad for you.

24:33.050 --> 24:35.118
But I'm giving you the opportunity

24:35.119 --> 24:38.655
to release the minister
with no bloodshed.

24:38.656 --> 24:40.990
You have five minutes.

25:02.946 --> 25:04.815
Hey.

25:04.816 --> 25:06.983
Aw.

25:06.984 --> 25:08.385
Hi.

25:08.386 --> 25:10.320
Did I miss everybody?

25:10.321 --> 25:12.789
Yeah. Sorry. Shane and
Sarah crashed a while ago.

25:12.790 --> 25:15.592
And the kids shortly after
that. I read that Iran

25:15.593 --> 25:17.794
returned the Israeli defense
minister... that's good.

25:17.795 --> 25:19.329
Yeah.

25:19.330 --> 25:21.531
That is good.

25:21.532 --> 25:23.300
We are...

25:23.301 --> 25:25.435
cautiously optimistic

25:25.436 --> 25:29.972
that we'll be able to walk
both sides back from the brink.

25:31.141 --> 25:33.410
You okay?

25:33.411 --> 25:35.111
Having a...

25:35.112 --> 25:37.814
nice visit with Shane?

25:37.815 --> 25:39.816
Sarah told me he lost his job

25:39.817 --> 25:42.486
- five months ago.
- No.

25:43.554 --> 25:45.789
That he barely leaves the house, and...

25:45.790 --> 25:48.792
I'm worried he's depressed.

25:48.793 --> 25:51.228
After everything that
went on with my dad,

25:51.229 --> 25:55.131
my mind goes to some very dark places.

25:55.132 --> 25:57.467
Have you talked to him?

25:57.468 --> 25:58.668
No.

26:01.838 --> 26:05.909
You gave a beautiful
eulogy at your dad's funeral

26:05.910 --> 26:08.345
about how all you stubborn McCords

26:08.346 --> 26:10.847
need to lean on each other.

26:10.848 --> 26:14.083
Yeah, well, obviously, it
didn't get through to him.

26:14.985 --> 26:17.454
And he hates it when I'm big brother-y.

26:19.891 --> 26:22.257
I'm afraid he'll clam up.

26:22.959 --> 26:25.628
You have to try.

26:36.607 --> 26:38.207
Hello.

26:40.544 --> 26:42.445
Okay.

26:42.446 --> 26:45.982
Thank you, Mr. President.

26:45.983 --> 26:47.751
What is it?

26:47.752 --> 26:49.319
You have to go in?

26:49.320 --> 26:51.054
There's new intel.

26:51.055 --> 26:55.424
Looks like Israel's gonna hit
Iran within the next 48 hours.

26:56.760 --> 26:58.562
Decades of enmity and...

26:58.563 --> 27:02.965
a couple of days to
figure out how to stop it.

27:03.967 --> 27:06.970
No wonder Munsey and Juliet
were against the Iran deal.

27:06.971 --> 27:09.940
So much so that they put
their lives on the line.

27:09.941 --> 27:11.875
You put your life on the line, too.

27:11.876 --> 27:13.944
Yeah, but they were right.

27:13.945 --> 27:16.245
Look at where we are now.

27:18.815 --> 27:21.051
Juliet was on the...

27:21.052 --> 27:24.187
Israel desk for almost 20 years.

27:24.188 --> 27:27.656
She obviously knew
something that I didn't.

27:32.495 --> 27:35.464
Well, did you ever ask her about it?

27:55.952 --> 27:57.953
Nice shoes.

28:00.223 --> 28:02.157
Ali picked them.

28:02.892 --> 28:05.996
She always had a good eye.

28:05.997 --> 28:09.198
Though heels are one thing I don't miss.

28:15.171 --> 28:17.340
It's freezing in here.

28:17.341 --> 28:20.377
You get used to it.

28:20.378 --> 28:22.379
It burns calories.

28:26.049 --> 28:28.617
It's good to see you.

28:29.886 --> 28:31.888
Of all the...

28:31.889 --> 28:34.424
different scenarios
that I had in my head

28:34.425 --> 28:37.093
about how you would greet me, that...

28:37.094 --> 28:39.629
that wasn't one of them.

28:39.630 --> 28:42.564
How are...?

28:44.267 --> 28:46.169
How are Henry and the kids?

28:46.170 --> 28:47.704
They're great. Everybody's...

28:47.705 --> 28:49.005
Stevie's engaged.

28:49.006 --> 28:50.640
Wow!

28:50.641 --> 28:52.876
You like the guy?

28:52.877 --> 28:54.044
Yes, I do.

28:54.045 --> 28:56.179
Maybe even more than she does.

28:56.180 --> 28:58.648
We see Aiden and Lily and Miles

28:58.649 --> 29:01.618
maybe every couple of months
just to check in, see...

29:01.619 --> 29:03.886
They seem good.

29:10.026 --> 29:13.362
So I'm guessing this
isn't just a social visit.

29:15.165 --> 29:16.700
What was it?

29:16.701 --> 29:19.469
- What was what?
- What was the reason

29:19.470 --> 29:22.939
that you... were part
of a plot to murder

29:22.940 --> 29:26.276
my predecessor and George
and foment a coup in Iran

29:26.277 --> 29:27.977
to spike the deal?

29:27.978 --> 29:31.681
Why were you so sure that
it would lead us to...?

29:31.682 --> 29:32.849
Where we are now?

29:32.850 --> 29:36.352
You had deep contacts
in Mossad and VEVAK.

29:36.353 --> 29:38.288
What did you know

29:38.289 --> 29:39.956
that Conrad and I didn't?

29:39.957 --> 29:42.357
Nothing. It was all obvious.

29:46.362 --> 29:48.364
After Iraq fell,

29:48.365 --> 29:50.700
the balance of power
in the region shifted

29:50.701 --> 29:52.001
in Iran's favor.

29:52.002 --> 29:54.604
Sanctions were the only
thing that kept them in check.

29:54.605 --> 29:57.073
Lifting them allowed Iran

29:57.074 --> 29:59.576
to become an economic powerhouse.

29:59.577 --> 30:01.311
So that's... that's it?

30:01.312 --> 30:03.213
But their agenda never changed.

30:03.214 --> 30:05.515
Mainly, to wipe Israel off the map.

30:05.516 --> 30:08.685
Any deal that would
lift Iran's sanctions

30:08.686 --> 30:10.353
was doomed to bring us

30:10.354 --> 30:11.888
- to this place?
- Any deal

30:11.889 --> 30:14.324
within the realm of possibility, yes.

30:14.325 --> 30:15.525
What-what does that mean?

30:15.526 --> 30:17.160
You went at it the wrong way.

30:17.161 --> 30:20.029
You gave Israel the Heisman,
when what you really needed

30:20.030 --> 30:22.098
was Israel at the negotiating table.

30:22.099 --> 30:23.533
Iran, the P5

30:23.534 --> 30:25.635
and Israel.

30:25.636 --> 30:28.805
Okay, so in this impossible... scenario,

30:28.806 --> 30:30.273
what else would Israel need?

30:30.274 --> 30:32.175
Iran would have to discontinue

30:32.176 --> 30:34.277
its support of Hezbollah and Hamas.

30:35.713 --> 30:39.382
And then I... suppose Iran
would probably want Israel

30:39.383 --> 30:41.718
to acknowledge their nuclear program.

30:41.719 --> 30:45.688
And Israel would have to
provide security guarantees

30:45.689 --> 30:47.757
and waive U.S. support.

30:47.758 --> 30:49.926
All of which is impossible.

30:49.927 --> 30:53.396
So a peace deal between
Iran and the West

30:53.397 --> 30:55.899
is impossible.

30:55.900 --> 30:58.401
Funny that the price
of winning this argument

30:58.402 --> 31:00.369
is a life sentence.

31:01.070 --> 31:03.173
So according to Juliet,

31:03.174 --> 31:04.957
and reinforced by
everything that's happened,

31:04.958 --> 31:07.177
the only solution is an impossible one.

31:07.178 --> 31:09.012
How is she? Stupid question,

31:09.013 --> 31:10.331
but you know what I mean.

31:10.332 --> 31:13.049
Well, in better spirits
than you might imagine.

31:13.050 --> 31:15.285
It was nice to see her.

31:15.286 --> 31:17.187
Complicated, obviously.

31:17.188 --> 31:19.855
Thanks for thinking outside the box.

31:20.523 --> 31:22.725
- Hi.
- How's he doing?

31:22.726 --> 31:24.861
All his vitals are strong, thank God.

31:24.862 --> 31:27.063
Well, you can't keep a good man down.

31:27.064 --> 31:28.464
Yes, I can.

31:28.465 --> 31:31.067
No shoptalk. Please?

31:31.068 --> 31:34.404
Trust me, Carol, the last
thing I want is to talk shop.

31:34.405 --> 31:37.273
You have visitors.

31:40.710 --> 31:41.945
How you feeling, pal?

31:41.946 --> 31:44.681
Like a stuffed goose.

31:44.682 --> 31:46.482
With astonishingly good vitals.

31:46.483 --> 31:49.319
Your daughter fell
down on the job, Bess.

31:49.320 --> 31:50.653
She's smart.

31:50.654 --> 31:54.224
She knows Carol's the one
to really be afraid of.

31:54.225 --> 31:56.926
Just a few minutes, okay?

31:58.195 --> 31:59.962
I'm guessing...

32:01.998 --> 32:03.833
Taylor told you about Evans'

32:03.834 --> 32:05.068
genetic testing report.

32:05.069 --> 32:07.604
Carol's right outside, man.

32:07.605 --> 32:09.572
Have you leaked it yet?

32:09.573 --> 32:11.140
No.

32:11.141 --> 32:12.909
But you can rest assured

32:12.910 --> 32:14.210
I know where you stand, okay?

32:14.211 --> 32:15.278
Don't do it.

32:15.279 --> 32:17.413
Don't do it.

32:17.414 --> 32:19.782
It's not who you are.

32:19.783 --> 32:21.284
I know, I know,

32:21.285 --> 32:23.286
I know... a few days ago

32:23.287 --> 32:24.754
I probably would have told you

32:24.755 --> 32:27.289
to stick the shiv in Evans' back.

32:28.558 --> 32:30.359
But...

32:31.294 --> 32:34.430
I've been to the brink of death, or...

32:34.431 --> 32:36.199
whatever you call this.

32:36.200 --> 32:39.936
And-and-and I see
things differently now.

32:39.937 --> 32:41.537
I just...

32:41.538 --> 32:44.641
People aren't gonna support you

32:44.642 --> 32:47.176
'cause of some political dirty trick.

32:47.177 --> 32:49.545
They trust you

32:49.546 --> 32:52.115
to make difficult decisions,

32:52.116 --> 32:54.684
and to do the principled thing

32:54.685 --> 32:57.719
instead of what's politically expedient.

32:59.188 --> 33:03.025
They don't want you to be
a street fighter like me.

33:04.794 --> 33:07.029
They want you to be a knight.

33:09.132 --> 33:11.433
So go be a knight.

33:15.905 --> 33:17.506
Okay.

33:20.643 --> 33:22.145
Look,

33:22.146 --> 33:23.879
we should let you rest.

33:25.281 --> 33:28.284
We'll, we'll check
back with you soon.

33:28.285 --> 33:30.552
Good night.

33:32.555 --> 33:34.424
Night.

33:34.425 --> 33:37.393
Either Russell saw the
face of God or his brain

33:37.394 --> 33:39.861
is swimming in a quart of painkillers.

33:41.864 --> 33:43.732
What if it's the former?

33:44.634 --> 33:46.402
Juliet said the only way to make

33:46.403 --> 33:48.104
real, lasting peace with Iran

33:48.105 --> 33:50.239
was by bringing Israel to the table.

33:50.240 --> 33:52.108
So let's bring Israel to the table.

33:52.109 --> 33:53.843
And how do you propose we do that?

33:53.844 --> 33:55.878
Both countries are facing devastation,

33:55.879 --> 33:58.781
- maybe even total destruction.
- And when you've

33:58.782 --> 34:00.650
been to the brink of death,

34:00.651 --> 34:02.585
you see things differently.

34:02.586 --> 34:05.822
So let's use the brink

34:05.823 --> 34:07.523
to our advantage. I mean,

34:07.524 --> 34:09.659
shouldn't Iran and Israel

34:09.659 --> 34:12.427
be open to hearing a way out?

34:22.398 --> 34:23.717
Here goes nothing.

34:23.719 --> 34:25.485
They're here because of you, sir.

34:25.487 --> 34:27.110
Because I threw my weight around.

34:27.110 --> 34:28.556
Well, that's something.

34:28.556 --> 34:31.225
Not if we fail.

34:31.226 --> 34:33.127
Then it's just annihilation.

34:33.128 --> 34:35.896
At least there's no pressure.

34:39.567 --> 34:41.402
Let's make a deal.

34:41.402 --> 34:43.170
We don't let them leave the room

34:43.172 --> 34:45.505
until they agree to the framework.

34:45.507 --> 34:48.676
Are you prepared to put Prime
Minister Aaronson in a headlock?

34:48.677 --> 34:50.645
Whatever it takes. I figure you got

34:50.646 --> 34:52.480
at least a head on Shiraz, so...

34:52.481 --> 34:54.614
What happened to being a knight?

34:54.616 --> 34:56.617
Knights lance their enemies

34:56.618 --> 34:58.786
like shish kebabs.

34:58.787 --> 35:01.421
Deal.

35:02.590 --> 35:04.659
Prime Minister Aaronson,
thank you for coming.

35:04.660 --> 35:06.259
Madam Secretary.

35:08.663 --> 35:10.865
President Shiraz.

35:10.866 --> 35:12.200
It's good to see you.

35:12.201 --> 35:13.833
President Dalton.

35:19.540 --> 35:22.043
You can't be serious.

35:22.044 --> 35:24.911
It's how you avoid a war.

35:25.646 --> 35:27.615
I would rather fight a war

35:27.616 --> 35:29.617
than back down from our sworn enemy.

35:29.618 --> 35:31.819
A sworn enemy with nuclear weapons.

35:31.820 --> 35:33.621
We have the advantage.

35:33.622 --> 35:35.490
Why should we blink?

35:35.491 --> 35:37.258
I'm asking you to open your eyes.

35:37.259 --> 35:39.460
I'm listening.

35:39.461 --> 35:41.929
What if Iran cut ties
with Hezbollah and Hamas

35:41.930 --> 35:43.431
and officially acknowledged...

35:43.432 --> 35:44.966
Israel's right to exist?

35:44.967 --> 35:46.801
Why would we ever agree to that?

35:46.802 --> 35:49.604
Because the United States
and Israel will provide you

35:49.605 --> 35:51.706
with ironclad security guarantees.

35:51.707 --> 35:53.541
That will never happen.

35:53.542 --> 35:55.109
And Israel will once and for all

35:55.110 --> 35:57.111
acknowledge its nuclear program.

35:57.112 --> 35:58.346
Impossible.

35:58.347 --> 35:59.347
That's impossible.

35:59.348 --> 36:00.815
It's only impossible

36:00.816 --> 36:03.150
if we fail to try.

36:03.151 --> 36:05.820
This framework is bold and aspirational,

36:05.821 --> 36:07.722
and I would be lying if I said

36:07.723 --> 36:11.259
we were anywhere close
to a signing ceremony.

36:11.260 --> 36:13.194
But the fact

36:13.195 --> 36:15.863
that Prime Minister
Aaronson and President Shiraz

36:15.864 --> 36:16.967
are standing here together,

36:16.968 --> 36:19.367
mere days after
agreeing to a cease-fire,

36:19.368 --> 36:23.170
is proof that anything is possible...

36:23.171 --> 36:25.406
if you can dream it.

36:25.407 --> 36:26.841
Together,

36:26.842 --> 36:30.510
we can make our shared
impossible dream come true.

36:38.419 --> 36:40.121
That's President Conrad Dalton,

36:40.122 --> 36:43.424
finishing historic remarks.
And, jumping to other...

36:43.425 --> 36:45.860
Hey, come on, how come you're
not dressed? Let's go already.

36:45.861 --> 36:48.529
Just saw Elizabeth in Geneva,
and now the House election thing

36:48.530 --> 36:49.368
is coming up.

36:49.369 --> 36:51.732
Well, that's gonna
take a while. Let's go.

36:51.733 --> 36:53.367
- Come on.
- No, you go ahead.

36:53.368 --> 36:55.836
To accommodate what's
happening in Washington...

36:55.837 --> 36:58.339
Whoa, what the hell?

36:58.340 --> 37:00.641
Look, you promised me at
least one full training run.

37:00.642 --> 37:02.977
- The race is tomorrow.
- This is it. - I will be fine.

37:02.978 --> 37:05.079
And I'm gonna kick your ass, old man.

37:05.080 --> 37:06.781
All right. Well, then get dressed.

37:06.782 --> 37:08.950
Get moving. It'll help.

37:08.951 --> 37:11.251
Help with what?

37:13.921 --> 37:15.456
Sarah told me you lost your job.

37:15.457 --> 37:17.024
I dragged it out of her.

37:17.025 --> 37:19.160
So what are you so mad at me about?

37:19.161 --> 37:20.661
I'm not mad, I'm concerned.

37:20.662 --> 37:22.396
I'm not asking you for money.

37:22.397 --> 37:24.165
- I'll-I'll get another job.
- You can always ask for... That's not...

37:24.166 --> 37:25.389
Look at you. You're depressed.

37:25.390 --> 37:27.201
- Really, Doctor?
- Have you...

37:27.202 --> 37:28.305
Are you seeing a therapist?

37:28.306 --> 37:29.570
I...

37:29.571 --> 37:32.106
I got no job, I can't
keep a woman around,

37:32.107 --> 37:34.775
and my daughter is leaving.
So what I am is sad.

37:34.776 --> 37:36.644
And how'd this become about me?

37:36.645 --> 37:38.279
I asked you to talk
Sarah out of throwing

37:38.280 --> 37:40.383
- the rest of her life away.
- She's concerned about you,

37:40.384 --> 37:41.716
and so am I. I... Look at Dad.

37:41.717 --> 37:44.638
- My God, you seriously think I'm Dad?
- Yeah, lo... I mean, that's...

37:44.639 --> 37:46.974
I don't know, but it-it's
nothing to be embarrassed about

37:46.975 --> 37:48.922
if you need to talk to somebody.

37:51.993 --> 37:53.626
Everything okay?

37:55.162 --> 37:57.231
What are you thinking,
telling Uncle Worrywart

37:57.232 --> 37:58.015
that I'm depressed?

37:58.016 --> 37:59.767
What were you thinking,
trying to get him

37:59.768 --> 38:01.869
to talk me out of the
Army? And you are depressed.

38:01.870 --> 38:04.605
- What is it with you people?
- What is it with you?

38:04.606 --> 38:05.800
Is he dropping out of the
race? 'Cause I will, too.

38:05.801 --> 38:06.474
Sorry that I'm not perfect.

38:06.475 --> 38:08.109
No one's dropping out.
You're not helping.

38:08.110 --> 38:09.147
Sorry for giving a
crap and for loving you.

38:09.171 --> 38:09.577
Just go back, okay?

38:09.578 --> 38:11.578
- Love me and leave me the hell alone.
- What, why?

38:11.602 --> 38:13.547
- Fine, you're alone.
- Just stay out of this.

38:13.548 --> 38:15.228
I don't even know what
we're talking about.

38:15.229 --> 38:16.332
Just stay out of it.

38:16.333 --> 38:19.020
My God, you guys, the
election... they're voting.

38:19.021 --> 38:21.055
Will the House now come to order?

38:21.056 --> 38:23.658
For the love of everything
holy, please, Carol.

38:23.659 --> 38:25.126
You want another heart attack?

38:25.127 --> 38:27.278
Let's see the results,
and I'll let you know.

38:27.303 --> 38:27.995
No. No.

38:27.996 --> 38:29.230
It's too much for you

38:29.231 --> 38:31.832
- to watch the tally.
- Or it's too much to know

38:31.833 --> 38:33.616
it's happening and not
know what's happening.

38:33.617 --> 38:35.836
Russell, you shouldn't
even know about the vote.

38:35.837 --> 38:38.139
Well, then you should've
gotten tougher nurses. Come on.

38:42.744 --> 38:45.212
You're killing me. You know that?

38:46.481 --> 38:48.783
Excuse me. I'm sorry, I know

38:48.784 --> 38:51.652
you said no calls, Dr.
Jackson, but President Dalton

38:51.653 --> 38:54.521
is on the line for Mr. Jackson.

38:56.223 --> 38:58.057
Carol.

38:59.460 --> 39:00.661
Fine.

39:00.662 --> 39:03.029
Thanks, Joanne.

39:05.966 --> 39:08.735
Yes. I have him right here.

39:12.139 --> 39:14.440
Hello.

39:21.248 --> 39:24.185
Hello, Mr. President.

39:24.186 --> 39:26.187
No. No, sir, we were,

39:26.188 --> 39:28.454
having trouble with the TV.

39:45.806 --> 39:48.074
Congratulations, Mr. President.

39:54.982 --> 39:57.250
I'm honored to know you.

40:23.477 --> 40:25.645
Thank you.

40:27.047 --> 40:28.983
Matt "The Flash" Mahoney.

40:28.984 --> 40:31.218
- Ready to go?
- Man...

40:31.219 --> 40:33.387
we'll find out?

40:33.388 --> 40:36.489
And the race will begin in two minutes.

40:39.093 --> 40:41.562
Madam Secretary.

40:41.563 --> 40:43.930
I'm surprised to see
you got back so fast.

40:46.066 --> 40:48.969
- Yeah. Nice to see you, Governor Evans.
- Good to see you.

40:48.970 --> 40:51.605
My husband's a leatherneck.
It's a family tradition,

40:51.606 --> 40:53.541
so I hightailed it

40:53.542 --> 40:56.010
back from Geneva.

40:56.011 --> 40:58.979
I'd be lying if I said
I didn't shed a tear

40:58.980 --> 41:01.582
at that tableau of Dalton
with Aaronson and Shiraz.

41:02.851 --> 41:04.151
Congratulations.

41:04.152 --> 41:06.921
Thanks. Yeah, we'll see what happens.

41:06.922 --> 41:08.923
And congratulations to you

41:08.924 --> 41:11.358
on a hard-fought race.

41:11.359 --> 41:13.194
I admire your patriotism.

41:13.195 --> 41:14.595
I know the...

41:14.596 --> 41:15.796
the president does, too.

41:15.797 --> 41:17.798
Does he?

41:20.402 --> 41:22.870
It's good to see you.

41:22.871 --> 41:26.440
Hey, I-I know about your,
um, your little meeting

41:26.441 --> 41:30.576
with the state senators in
Ohio a couple of months back.

41:31.679 --> 41:33.681
Well, that's all on
the up and up, Governor.

41:33.682 --> 41:36.550
Well... you may want
to read The Vasey Act.

41:36.551 --> 41:38.886
It's a little-known,
anti-lobbying law.

41:38.887 --> 41:42.857
It's been on the books
in Ohio since about 1893.

41:42.858 --> 41:44.592
Hey, Sam.

41:44.593 --> 41:46.093
The election's over.

41:46.094 --> 41:47.394
Dalton won.

41:47.395 --> 41:50.296
Not if he didn't win Ohio.

41:51.665 --> 41:54.235
I'm filing suit in
Cleveland tomorrow morning.

41:54.236 --> 41:56.503
On what basis?

41:56.504 --> 41:57.805
You lobbied Ohio state senators

41:57.806 --> 41:59.240
to get Dalton on the ballot

41:59.241 --> 42:00.941
despite their sore loser law.

42:00.942 --> 42:04.478
Court rules in my favor,
I win Ohio, get to 270.

42:06.581 --> 42:08.881
This whole exercise in
the House never happened.

42:11.785 --> 42:13.353
Good luck in the race.

42:14.054 --> 42:15.855
Runners ready!

42:17.324 --> 42:18.893
Come on, let's go!

42:18.894 --> 42:20.394
Oorah, oorah!

42:20.395 --> 42:21.762
Oorah!
