00:01.760 --> 00:03.860
On this episode of "Mythbusters" --

00:03.860 --> 00:05.370
I'm king of the world.

00:05.370 --> 00:07.390
We were diving into the death,

00:09.070 --> 00:11.930
We might as well been holding handful of chum.

00:11.930 --> 00:14.440
shaping up ban shipping out

00:16.970 --> 00:21.690
to get the inside scoop on the myth that a gun hole for H2O,

00:21.690 --> 00:23.060
That made our dive master

00:23.060 --> 00:24.380
kind of nervous for some reason.

00:24.480 --> 00:25.690
I don't know why.

00:25.690 --> 00:28.610
as we count down the top 12

00:28.610 --> 00:32.240
wettest and wildest moments in mythbuster history.

00:32.240 --> 00:34.490
It is true that I wet myself

00:34.490 --> 00:37.200
during the course of testing that story.

00:37.200 --> 00:39.430
It was disgusting.

00:41.850 --> 00:43.790
Who are the mythbusters?

00:43.790 --> 00:46.530
Adam Savage,

00:46.530 --> 00:48.190
and Jamie Heinaman.

00:48.550 --> 00:49.630
I almost too excited.

00:49.630 --> 00:54.290
Between them, more than 30 years of special-effects experience.

00:54.360 --> 00:56.960
Together with Grant Imahara,

00:57.120 --> 00:57.900
Save yourself.

00:57.970 --> 01:01.680
Kari Byron

01:01.680 --> 01:04.290
and Tory Belleci.

01:05.160 --> 01:07.000
They don't just tell the myths.

01:07.070 --> 01:10.320
They put them to the test.

01:16.710 --> 01:21.910
For this mythbusters dirty dozen special, just add water.

01:27.340 --> 01:29.070
What are we waiting for?

01:29.140 --> 01:30.340
Just one moment.

01:30.670 --> 01:31.300
Only one.

01:31.370 --> 01:33.130
Okay. They are late so I guess I'll tell you.

01:33.130 --> 01:35.090
We are counting down the top 12

01:35.090 --> 01:39.260
best mythbusters moments that involve water.

01:39.330 --> 01:39.930
Water?

01:40.000 --> 01:41.080
Water.

01:41.430 --> 01:42.760
So anything that we've done

01:42.830 --> 01:46.110
that involves us being around, in, or under the water?

01:46.110 --> 01:46.970
Exactly.

01:47.040 --> 01:47.690
It gives us a chance to

01:47.690 --> 01:48.720
celebrate and scrutinize our

01:48.720 --> 01:50.830
best myth busters watery escapades.

01:50.830 --> 01:54.070
- Any chance to see Jamie swim in syrup again? - Precisely.

01:59.280 --> 02:01.390
- This is the pool party? - Lame.

02:02.440 --> 02:03.970
Let's start the show.

02:05.060 --> 02:08.560
First up in the wet and wild ride --

02:09.919 --> 02:11.880
We've sunk boats.

02:12.070 --> 02:13.970
We've raised boats.

02:15.940 --> 02:17.830
We've nearly drowned in cars

02:17.830 --> 02:20.050
but we should really kick this off

02:20.120 --> 02:22.300
with water slide wipeout.

02:22.300 --> 02:23.790
The myth is an online video

02:23.790 --> 02:25.370
that a fan sent us that shows

02:25.370 --> 02:27.380
Some guys having built a massive

02:27.380 --> 02:29.940
water slide on the side of this hill.

02:30.030 --> 02:32.770
He slides down it, hits the edge

02:32.770 --> 02:34.400
of the water, slides in the air

02:34.400 --> 02:35.280
for this impossible long length

02:35.280 --> 02:38.380
of time and lands safely in this

02:38.380 --> 02:41.270
tiny, little swimming pool like 100 feet away.

02:41.270 --> 02:43.870
That was our task, to test that.

02:43.870 --> 02:45.420
With the guys not willing to

02:45.420 --> 02:48.540
risk their lives on sticking the landing,

02:48.540 --> 02:49.170
Splat!

02:49.170 --> 02:53.260
They decided to test this slide over water.

02:53.260 --> 02:55.470
But, first, they had to build it.

02:55.470 --> 02:56.930
Isn't that great?

02:56.930 --> 02:59.510
It is like monster truck fantasy camp.

02:59.510 --> 03:02.280
The building of this ramp was positively egyptian.

03:02.280 --> 03:03.300
I mean, I'm down at the bottom

03:03.740 --> 03:06.140
putting together this wood frame and truss work

03:06.430 --> 03:09.060
that will hold the plywood together for the actual ramp part

03:09.740 --> 03:11.260
while Jamie is up top feeding

03:11.610 --> 03:14.330
this massive hundreds of foot long piece of plywood 

03:14.610 --> 03:15.720
he is screwing together up top 

03:16.030 --> 03:18.260
and slowly rolling down towards me.

03:18.490 --> 03:20.050
It looks great.

03:20.870 --> 03:25.090
You really don't get the sense from a camera how steep something is

03:25.090 --> 03:27.230
like you do when you are really there.

03:27.290 --> 03:30.360
Let me tell you, that was one steep slide.

03:30.430 --> 03:33.720
It was so steep that you really had to struggle to walk up or down it.

03:34.140 --> 03:36.550
Finally, with the mega wosh complete,

03:36.550 --> 03:39.290
it was time for its first human test.

03:39.290 --> 03:42.830
I started from halfway up the ramp figuring that would be safe.

03:42.830 --> 03:46.160
It was almost the most dangerous thing we did in the whole thing.

03:46.450 --> 03:48.200
It wasn't going very fast so

03:48.200 --> 03:51.280
he kind of dropped like a son right off the end of it.

03:54.100 --> 03:55.940
Gave me a bit of a sinking feeling, 

03:55.940 --> 03:58.820
because I knew there wasn't much depth of water there, 

03:58.820 --> 04:01.920
which meant he could have gotten hurt.

04:04.060 --> 04:04.790
I'm okay.

04:06.390 --> 04:10.190
But, if at first, you don't succeed, try again. Higher.

04:10.190 --> 04:11.850
We found out once we started testing that 

04:12.170 --> 04:14.710
the lubrication we put on the slide was extremely important.

04:15.060 --> 04:16.740
If you didn't do it exactly right,

04:16.740 --> 04:18.450
you weren't going to get enough speed and 

04:18.450 --> 04:21.250
you wouldn't go far enough off the end of the ramp.

04:21.250 --> 04:23.180
Adam figured the best the way to do this was to 

04:23.640 --> 04:25.810
just dump a massive bucket of it on to the slide.

04:27.120 --> 04:29.190
But after a face full of foam --

04:29.260 --> 04:31.590
I couldn't see a thing. I hit the ramp blind.

04:31.660 --> 04:35.000
I figured we would be better off by putting it on the sprayer.

04:35.000 --> 04:39.160
Adam agreed that Jamie had the lubrication thrust.

04:40.830 --> 04:43.410
But on day two, it was accuracy, not

04:43.410 --> 04:45.980
lubrication giving Adam a headache.

04:47.360 --> 04:48.290
I landed wrong.

04:48.290 --> 04:49.990
When you land wrong flying

04:49.990 --> 04:51.090
70 feet through the air into water, 

04:51.090 --> 04:53.430
you get an instant headache.

04:55.440 --> 04:56.770
By the time of the third jump

04:56.840 --> 05:00.560
when we actually had our target out, I was really cranky.

05:00.560 --> 05:02.800
So our safety guide, stunt coordinator,

05:02.800 --> 05:05.030
Nick Pussie comes up to the top of the ramp 

05:05.030 --> 05:07.670
and says to me, are you a stunt man, man?

05:07.670 --> 05:09.670
It is not here, it is here.

05:09.670 --> 05:11.550
You do all the work before you leave the ramp.

05:11.550 --> 05:14.680
The only thing I want you thinking when you hit that water is,

05:14.680 --> 05:17.850
does my director, Alex, want another take.

05:17.850 --> 05:20.130
You know how to do this. I will see you at the bottom.

05:20.130 --> 05:22.870
And he turned around and went to the bottom of the ramp.

05:22.870 --> 05:25.030
And three, two --

05:25.030 --> 05:26.570
As I thought, oh, my god, i'm in a movie,

05:26.570 --> 05:29.170
I'm in a movie about a guy about to doing a key jump.

05:30.790 --> 05:32.930
The thing was, his talk worked perfectly.

05:33.000 --> 05:38.100
My third jump, I landed perfectly 50-degree angle,

05:38.100 --> 05:39.460
feet in the center of the target,

05:39.460 --> 05:42.720
didn't even disturb the actual target.

05:42.720 --> 05:44.140
It is the bull's eye that

05:44.140 --> 05:48.260
rocketed this incredible wet and wild moment into our countdown.

05:48.260 --> 05:49.790
It couldn't have gone better.

05:51.650 --> 05:56.750
Next is an explosive boom and bust.

05:58.010 --> 06:01.070
No myth the busters countdown would ever be complete

06:01.270 --> 06:02.880
without a blast.

06:04.480 --> 06:07.830
Explosives and water make one heck of a team.

06:07.830 --> 06:10.120
I don't get that excited about using explosives to

06:10.120 --> 06:11.950
just destroy things.

06:12.860 --> 06:17.380
I do find it really interesting when you can use them to do specific work.

06:17.380 --> 06:19.850
So that would mean my favorite water explosion

06:19.850 --> 06:22.660
would have to involve safe cracking.

06:22.660 --> 06:24.460
The story here was that you

06:24.530 --> 06:26.190
could open this safe without

06:26.260 --> 06:27.360
destroying the contents by

06:27.430 --> 06:29.650
filling it with water first.

06:31.570 --> 06:33.530
We got a safe. We filled it with water.

06:33.530 --> 06:36.470
We put explosives in it and we blew it up.

06:36.540 --> 06:40.150
Three, two, one.

06:44.680 --> 06:45.850
Look at the door.

06:46.650 --> 06:48.420
That worked beautifully.

06:48.620 --> 06:49.490
I would like to point out that

06:49.490 --> 06:51.630
former FBI special agent, Frank Doyle,

06:51.630 --> 06:54.220
offered us all a steak dinner if it worked.

06:54.220 --> 06:57.290
So convinced was he that it would not.

06:57.290 --> 07:01.050
We've never yet gotten our steak dinner, Frank.

07:02.520 --> 07:05.990
But for the ultimate combination of water and explosives

07:06.000 --> 07:07.950
it is over to Grant.

07:08.020 --> 07:09.380
So the black powder shark myth

07:09.380 --> 07:11.630
comes from the movie "Deep Blue Sea."

07:11.630 --> 07:14.990
In that, the hero has to kill this highly intelligent

07:15.000 --> 07:17.590
very deadly, very large shark.

07:18.000 --> 07:23.000
What he does is empties a number of flares into a canister

07:23.140 --> 07:24.880
There should be enough black powder in this flare

07:24.890 --> 07:27.290
to give us 2 1/2 sticks of dynamite.

07:27.690 --> 07:31.750
He fires it at the shark that connected by a steel cable back

07:31.750 --> 07:36.000
to him which he then touches to the end of a battery and "Boom!".

07:37.840 --> 07:39.000
The shark blows up.

07:40.020 --> 07:43.100
First things first, they needed a big fish to fry.

07:43.100 --> 07:47.310
So Tory created Hugo. The giant foam shark.

07:47.310 --> 07:50.840
So often on the show, our schedule doesn't allow us to

07:50.840 --> 07:53.970
take time to make it exactly how you want it,

07:53.970 --> 07:56.400
but this one magical time on Myth Busters,

07:56.440 --> 07:59.230
I was allowed to sculpt this shark.

08:01.730 --> 08:04.740
It turned out better than I thought it would.

08:04.740 --> 08:09.740
He put so much time and love into building that big shark.

08:09.980 --> 08:12.350
That was a great idea. How you getting back on the boat?

08:12.410 --> 08:13.910
I haven't thought about that yet.

08:13.980 --> 08:15.460
Even named it.

08:15.460 --> 08:18.260
He might even have crossed the line a little bit.

08:20.010 --> 08:21.430
That a shark.

08:25.100 --> 08:25.960
Finally, at the lake

08:26.280 --> 08:28.870
with Hugo ready to become shark foam soup,

08:29.160 --> 08:31.150
the guys flared up their flares.

08:31.150 --> 08:33.750
What we actually found when we tested this,

08:33.750 --> 08:36.730
when you set off that amount of black powder under water.

08:36.799 --> 08:40.450
Ready to fire in three, two, one.

08:40.450 --> 08:42.450
Pretty much nothing happened.

08:43.340 --> 08:45.370
It did no damage at all.

08:45.370 --> 08:47.680
So we did what we usually do.

08:47.680 --> 08:49.400
We called in our friend, Frank Doyle.

08:49.400 --> 08:52.570
He brought 400 pounds of explosives

08:52.570 --> 08:55.670
to actually execute the final experiment.

08:55.670 --> 08:57.420
It is going to be magnificent.

08:57.420 --> 09:00.960
Magnificent compared to the previous damp squid.

09:00.960 --> 09:03.010
We are waiting for this explosion to go off.

09:03.010 --> 09:05.850
We give a three, two, one!

09:09.170 --> 09:11.120
And then nothing happens.

09:11.120 --> 09:14.210
This is every bomb tech's worst nightmare.

09:15.960 --> 09:19.350
All of us, I think, starting to get a little heart flutter

09:19.350 --> 09:22.380
because the bomb squad had to take a boat all the way in

09:22.450 --> 09:23.850
and find out what went wrong.

09:23.850 --> 09:26.850
This is like the worst experiment ever.

09:26.920 --> 09:28.680
We hadn't been trained to problem solve

09:28.680 --> 09:30.930
a bomb of that size not going off.

09:30.930 --> 09:33.190
I would not want to be the person in charge.

09:33.190 --> 09:36.770
Frank Doyle definitely earned his stripes that day.

09:36.770 --> 09:39.990
- He is a bad ass. - Indeed, he is.

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
After a gut-wrenching 40-minute wait with the charges reset,

09:46.700 --> 09:50.720
it was time for take two.

09:51.390 --> 09:53.830
Three, two, one!

10:00.140 --> 10:05.000
This huge tower of water just shot into the air

10:05.000 --> 10:06.880
pieces of Hugo everywhere.

10:06.880 --> 10:08.950
We got down to the lake.

10:08.950 --> 10:13.340
It was just foam rubber shark pieces floating all over.

10:13.890 --> 10:15.470
Hugo!

10:16.440 --> 10:19.770
For Tory, although Hugo was hugh gone, 

10:19.840 --> 10:23.170
at least he will always have the high speeds.

10:23.240 --> 10:26.210
After the break, swimming Hyneman style.

10:26.210 --> 10:29.100
Raise arms up, leave out of water, put arms down

10:29.100 --> 10:33.100
And later what will be the wettest and wildest number one?

10:33.100 --> 10:34.360
Drum roll, please.

10:40.560 --> 10:43.600
There is water, water everywhere.

10:43.600 --> 10:48.600
Because we are counting down our most memorable myths.

10:48.910 --> 10:50.780
At number ten, the guys slip into

10:50.850 --> 10:53.870
something a little more uncomfortable.

10:57.880 --> 11:01.090
Obviously, whether you are tackling myths that are wet or wild

11:01.410 --> 11:02.760
or especially both,

11:02.860 --> 11:03.840
it means that you are going to get wet

11:03.840 --> 11:06.870
And often when you are going to get wet,

11:08.120 --> 11:10.900
Unfortunately, it means you are going to get cold too.

11:10.900 --> 11:14.310
Yep, experimenting in water can get very cold very fast.

11:14.310 --> 11:17.360
@#%$&*!

11:20.000 --> 11:23.030
The most hypothermic myth they they ever tested

11:23.150 --> 11:25.000
will surprise you.

11:26.090 --> 11:28.180
The coldest and wetest I think we've ever been

11:28.180 --> 11:30.180
has to be swimming in syrup.

11:30.180 --> 11:31.410
The question was whether or not

11:31.480 --> 11:35.600
you could swim faster in syrup rather than water.

11:37.190 --> 11:40.210
The reason it was so cold is two-fold.

11:40.820 --> 11:43.090
One it was winter in San Francisco,

11:43.090 --> 11:45.270
which is not cold by most people's standard.

11:45.270 --> 11:46.600
But when you are swimming in syrup,

11:46.600 --> 11:48.260
it's pretty freking cold.

11:48.260 --> 11:50.760
The second reason is because the syrup

11:50.760 --> 11:53.250
is not something you can dry off of yourself.

11:53.250 --> 11:55.320
You have to be rinsed off.

11:55.320 --> 11:56.630
You have to be rinsed off in water 

11:56.630 --> 12:00.670
we could never get warmer than slightly look warm.

12:00.670 --> 12:02.770
It may have been freezing

12:02.840 --> 12:05.220
but what warmed the cockles of Adam's heart

12:05.990 --> 12:08.040
was Jamie swimming.

12:08.040 --> 12:09.620
Jamie's technique at swimming

12:09.620 --> 12:11.370
is kind of like his technique at building something,

12:11.370 --> 12:13.710
in which he thinks through every step as he is going

12:14.060 --> 12:15.710
which makes him a little bit plotting as a swimmer.

12:16.070 --> 12:18.930
I belive he is actually doing this, raise arms up,

12:19.010 --> 12:21.720
lift out of water, put arms down, swim forward;

12:21.720 --> 12:23.460
raise arms up, lift out of water, put...

12:23.460 --> 12:26.420
Like he is like a robot working through a set of instructions.

12:26.420 --> 12:28.390
I was actually surprised

12:28.390 --> 12:31.500
how difficult it was for him to swim.

12:31.560 --> 12:34.940
I thought he descended from the great walrus tribe.

12:34.940 --> 12:37.000
So I figure he would be great swimmer.

12:38.540 --> 12:40.000
The great walrus tribe,

12:40.000 --> 12:41.910
I am going to get killed for that one.

12:44.570 --> 12:48.510
The next is a moment all about dunking and diving.

12:50.990 --> 12:52.780
Our intrepid mythbusters have

12:52.780 --> 12:56.680
gone under cover under water for many a myth.

12:56.680 --> 12:57.780
It is party time.

12:58.710 --> 13:02.780
But when it comes to strange suits and underwater adventures

13:02.850 --> 13:07.420
The maritime myth of a diver stuck to his diving helmet

13:07.420 --> 13:10.200
takes the grizzly prize.

13:11.650 --> 13:14.110
With Kari on maternity leave,

13:14.960 --> 13:17.640
it was down to Tory to create the diver.

13:17.640 --> 13:22.880
I present to you, my creation, meat man.

13:24.550 --> 13:25.820
Oh, I almost throw up.

13:26.540 --> 13:27.940
Meat man was disgusting.

13:28.010 --> 13:30.680
I had a love for him, because I built the guy

13:30.680 --> 13:33.290
but he was rotting pork meat.

13:33.290 --> 13:36.690
At one point, the refrigerator truck got shut off.

13:36.760 --> 13:39.280
So it spent a night unrefrigerated.

13:39.280 --> 13:44.020
The next day, the rotting flesh was unbearable.

13:44.020 --> 13:45.330
How many mythbusters does it take

13:45.330 --> 13:46.940
to get meat men in a diving suit?

13:46.940 --> 13:50.480
With their old time diving suit completely porked out,

13:50.550 --> 13:54.330
it was time for meat man to meet his deep sea fate.

13:54.330 --> 13:57.030
If you see any sharks, play dead.

13:57.100 --> 13:59.450
At 300 feet below the surface

13:59.450 --> 14:03.270
with the underwater camera poised, Grant cut the cord.

14:03.270 --> 14:05.740
Three, two, one.

14:06.170 --> 14:07.910
One thing we didn't foresee,

14:07.970 --> 14:11.980
the suit was filled with the stench of rotting flesh.

14:12.040 --> 14:13.740
So when Grant vented the suit,

14:13.810 --> 14:17.850
all that air came rushing into the boat with us.

14:17.850 --> 14:20.070
It was nauseating.

14:22.050 --> 14:26.980
Then, at one moment, everything just gets to the point where it all goes.

14:31.450 --> 14:33.260
The meat man is in the helmet.

14:33.330 --> 14:36.770
You see all the guts squashed up against the glass.

14:36.770 --> 14:38.890
It was disgusting.

14:39.730 --> 14:40.870
It works.

14:41.970 --> 14:45.360
It worked so well that it is also a demonstration of why you

14:45.360 --> 14:48.700
should never lend the mythbusters anything.

14:48.700 --> 14:52.190
We boroughed a set of antique diving equipment.

14:52.190 --> 14:54.860
His stomach is inside his helmet.

14:54.930 --> 14:57.070
We promised the guy.

14:57.070 --> 14:59.130
No, it is totally going to be fine. It is going to be great.

14:59.130 --> 15:00.710
Don't worry about it.

15:03.090 --> 15:06.730
The helmet was not in returnable condition.

15:06.730 --> 15:10.460
Later -- it is a little scary down here.

15:10.460 --> 15:10.920
But, first --

15:10.920 --> 15:13.060
Like this -- we were like,

15:13.060 --> 15:14.090
Oh, my god.

15:19.630 --> 15:21.740
Next on the Wet and Wild splashdown 

15:22.110 --> 15:23.830
is a myth as cold as ice.

15:27.320 --> 15:28.690
The idea behind the myth of

15:28.690 --> 15:32.490
blue ice is that there is a leaky toilet on a commercial airline.

15:32.730 --> 15:34.880
That leaky toilet allows a giant chunk of ice

15:34.880 --> 15:36.780
to form on the side of the jet.

15:36.780 --> 15:38.660
That chunk of ice breaks off 

15:38.660 --> 15:41.160
and punches a hole into someone's house.

15:42.300 --> 15:43.420
How do you capture

15:43.420 --> 15:45.470
the forming of blue ice on the outside

15:45.470 --> 15:47.430
of an moving airplane at altitude.

15:47.430 --> 15:49.750
I mean, it's almost impossible.

15:49.750 --> 15:54.810
Impossible, unless you have an open invitation to geektopia.

15:54.810 --> 15:56.070
The Isenar research center

15:56.070 --> 15:58.520
it is a world class research facility.

15:58.520 --> 16:00.960
They test spacecraft, fighter jets, 

16:01.020 --> 16:02.740
commercial aircraft and

16:02.740 --> 16:04.610
here we come in with our rinky dinky things.

16:04.990 --> 16:06.280
- Does this mean I am the R2D2?  - Oh, boy.

16:06.830 --> 16:08.690
But you know what, what makes it great is that

16:09.080 --> 16:10.700
they are like, "Absolutely, 

16:10.950 --> 16:13.280
we will help you out because we want to get to the bottom of this too."

16:14.580 --> 16:19.730
How can you not love a set of guys whose motto is, we freeze to please.

16:20.260 --> 16:22.120
However getting to the bottom of this

16:22.120 --> 16:25.020
myth was not as quick as you might think.

16:25.020 --> 16:25.800
Fire it up.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.990
All right, let's go. Fire it up.

16:28.060 --> 16:29.390
Maximum work.

16:30.970 --> 16:34.320
It takes hours to cool down the air,

16:34.320 --> 16:36.580
to chill it to operating temperature.

16:36.650 --> 16:39.220
We started our experiment at 8:00 A.M.

16:39.290 --> 16:42.720
We did not get out of there 1:00 A.M. the next day.

16:42.790 --> 16:46.260
So it turns out to be a 17-hour day.

16:46.330 --> 16:48.440
But those hours were well spent

16:48.440 --> 16:51.090
because this myth was looking plausible.

16:51.840 --> 16:54.080
Look out quick, guys. It is building up.

16:54.140 --> 16:55.930
The ice forms so perfectly

16:56.040 --> 16:59.420
that all the NASA guys could not believe how well it worked.

16:59.480 --> 17:02.270
They even told us, we have had tests

17:02.270 --> 17:05.050
that have been planned for years.

17:05.119 --> 17:07.329
It is approaching soccer ball size.

17:07.329 --> 17:10.260
And it's like, you guys throw this crazy thing together.

17:10.260 --> 17:11.780
We are getting bigger chunks breaking off.

17:11.780 --> 17:15.020
Come here, do the test and it works.

17:15.079 --> 17:17.800
I mean, they were just saying sometimes it

17:17.800 --> 17:20.730
just shows you, simple is better.

17:21.890 --> 17:24.930
Indeed. As jumping out of a plane with a block of

17:24.930 --> 17:28.200
simulated blue ice turned out to be.

17:29.500 --> 17:31.000
Steady attacked!

17:31.400 --> 17:33.220
Just as the myth predicted.

17:33.560 --> 17:34.330
Check it out.

17:34.330 --> 17:37.510
It dug itself into the ground.

17:37.510 --> 17:40.840
However, for those of you watching the skies --

17:40.840 --> 17:42.630
I really don't think that the

17:42.630 --> 17:44.710
chances are high it is going to happen.

17:44.710 --> 17:47.120
The chain of the events is a perfect

17:47.120 --> 17:48.650
storm of circumstances.

17:48.650 --> 17:53.050
I think it is going to be a pretty rare event but, it is still possible.

17:53.560 --> 17:54.950
From plummeting ice to the

17:54.950 --> 17:57.710
dangers of letting off steam, 

17:57.710 --> 18:00.680
At the other end of the spectrum from ice is gaseous water.

18:00.680 --> 18:01.760
And that is steam.

18:02.070 --> 18:06.060
Steam has absolutely given us some of our most choice moments on the show.

18:06.550 --> 18:10.270
From the Archimedes Cannon

18:11.330 --> 18:14.100
to exploding fire extinguishers,

18:16.590 --> 18:21.240
there has been a lot of hot and steamy mythbusters moments.

18:21.240 --> 18:23.960
You think that the shoo-in for the best moment

18:23.960 --> 18:25.950
would be the water heater rocket.

18:26.010 --> 18:27.040
There is a good reason for that.

18:27.040 --> 18:30.480
Becasue water heater's failing is pure

18:30.480 --> 18:32.540
unadulterated awesome.

18:37.690 --> 18:39.570
Unadulterated awesome,

18:39.570 --> 18:42.260
because you never know when they will blow.

18:42.260 --> 18:44.200
Right when you kind of relax

18:44.260 --> 18:45.680
and think everything is going to be okay, 

18:45.680 --> 18:49.060
that's when the vessel decides to rupture.

18:50.350 --> 18:54.250
But surprisingly, explosions pale in comparison to

18:54.250 --> 18:57.460
the extreme steam power of this.

18:57.460 --> 19:00.090
The steam power that gets the numb for me 

19:00.090 --> 19:01.530
is my favorite has to be steam machine gun.

19:01.530 --> 19:03.410
This is a mythical machine 

19:03.410 --> 19:05.540
supposed to be developed during the American civil war.

19:05.600 --> 19:08.930
That was a steam-powered rotary machine gun

19:08.930 --> 19:13.770
that had incredibly devlivered ball bearings at a deadly rate of speed.

19:14.910 --> 19:15.440
We built one.

19:15.990 --> 19:17.390
Yes, they did.

19:17.460 --> 19:20.320
And stoking their big, bad steam machine, 

19:20.390 --> 19:22.530
those unpredictable water heaters.

19:22.590 --> 19:23.830
It was during the build of the steam machine gun

19:24.150 --> 19:28.310
that Jamie and I got a truly visceral understanding of the power of steam.

19:30.540 --> 19:33.610
Oh, wow. I can see where it hit.

19:34.070 --> 19:37.130
Very pleased. And terrified.

19:37.850 --> 19:40.510
The steam machine gun was one of those devices that was 

19:40.900 --> 19:44.060
so over the top and kind of out of control.

19:46.180 --> 19:49.520
You might think that it was too dangerous to actually take on.

19:49.520 --> 19:53.370
This was for distance and for glory.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.550
Three, two, one.

20:03.480 --> 20:05.860
But, you know, we've done the math.

20:05.860 --> 20:09.520
We had made sure that we had the overpressure relief valves on it.

20:09.590 --> 20:13.440
We had very sturdy mechanical rigs and guards on it.

20:13.740 --> 20:18.640
But still, you know, you get stuff like that going really, really fast,

20:18.920 --> 20:19.860
it is kind of messed up.

20:22.130 --> 20:25.600
Messed up but ultimately busted.

20:25.700 --> 20:27.240
- Soldier! - Sir, yes, sir.

20:27.310 --> 20:30.410
What do you think of the steam machine gun as a weapon of war?

20:30.480 --> 20:32.820
Sir, it is not very effective, sir.

20:33.940 --> 20:35.570
Okay, let's get out of here.

20:35.790 --> 20:36.980
Coming right up, 

20:36.980 --> 20:39.670
this kills you and this kills everyone else in the room.

20:45.600 --> 20:49.620
We are halfway through our splashtacular countdown.

20:49.620 --> 20:52.210
But there are plenty more myths in the scence.

20:54.120 --> 20:57.140
Now, for a moment in the swim.

20:58.580 --> 21:00.100
Swimming pools have often

21:00.100 --> 21:02.330
played a key role in our myths.

21:02.330 --> 21:03.460
They are perfect for us.

21:03.460 --> 21:04.930
They are clear water.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.170
Swim harder.

21:06.240 --> 21:07.320
They are often quite accessible.

21:07.320 --> 21:08.450
You can pull vehicles right up to them.

21:08.450 --> 21:11.370
But, honestly, I pity our researchers

21:11.370 --> 21:13.070
that have phones calls they have to make.

21:13.070 --> 21:14.970
They got to call people up with a working swimming pool 

21:15.290 --> 21:16.280
that in perfect working order,

21:16.540 --> 21:21.910
and say, hi, can we sink a car in your swimming pool?

21:21.980 --> 21:24.110
We promise it is mostly clean.

21:24.110 --> 21:26.290
Hello, hello.

21:27.290 --> 21:28.800
I think the most impressive things 

21:28.800 --> 21:30.330
we have ever done in a pool

21:30.330 --> 21:32.880
is bullets fired into water. 

21:32.880 --> 21:34.280
Three, two, one.

21:35.330 --> 21:37.630
The question about bullets fireded into water was whether

21:37.700 --> 21:40.280
you could dive into the water to protect yourself 

21:40.740 --> 21:42.450
from somebody that was shooting at you.

21:42.990 --> 21:46.120
After testing all the guns in their arsenal --

21:46.190 --> 21:48.440
This is the black powder rifle.

21:49.460 --> 21:51.180
Here is a slug in the shotgun.

21:51.180 --> 21:52.410
One.

21:53.390 --> 21:56.170
This is m-1 grand 30 caliber.

21:58.460 --> 22:00.780
It turned out that a depth of three feet

22:00.790 --> 22:03.080
would be safe for a swimmer.

22:03.350 --> 22:04.790
There is your problem.

22:06.880 --> 22:09.150
But the ultimate big fish

22:09.150 --> 22:12.190
into a small pool was the 50 cal.

22:12.260 --> 22:16.350
This is a gun that shoots Bugs Bunny-sized banana bullets.

22:16.350 --> 22:18.210
This is the m-1 grand.

22:19.040 --> 22:21.800
This is the 50 caliber.

22:21.800 --> 22:22.550
This kills you.

22:22.550 --> 22:25.380
This kills you and everyone else in the room.

22:25.450 --> 22:26.900
These are really powerful,

22:26.900 --> 22:28.120
long-range weapons.

22:28.120 --> 22:30.500
They are not made to fire at things, 

22:30.500 --> 22:33.330
especially not a pool, at close range.

22:33.330 --> 22:35.330
So I didn't know what to expect.

22:35.330 --> 22:39.670
Let's just be prepared to pack and get out of here really fast.

22:40.150 --> 22:43.310
Hopefully, we will be gone before the pool fully drains.

22:44.100 --> 22:46.150
Okay, eyes and ears,

22:46.150 --> 22:49.030
this is a 50-caliber at ten feet.

22:49.100 --> 22:51.040
The water did stop the bullet quite nicely.

22:51.040 --> 22:55.290
Three, two, one.

22:58.250 --> 23:01.730
But the bullet did put most of the pool on the roof.

23:01.730 --> 23:05.140
It was raining in there for about five minutes afterwards.

23:05.140 --> 23:08.090
There was no bullet in the bullets' shell.

23:08.090 --> 23:11.550
So taking cover under water was confirmed.

23:11.620 --> 23:15.610
It spent all of its energy within three feet and became totally nonlethal.

23:16.960 --> 23:19.730
And that gave Adam ideas.

23:19.730 --> 23:21.420
Once we found out during that episode 

23:21.430 --> 23:24.260
how fast the bullets lost all their energy in the water,

23:24.260 --> 23:26.380
I wanted to finish the episode with Jamie

23:26.380 --> 23:28.410
in full scuba gear at the bottom of the pool

23:28.410 --> 23:31.140
while I unloaded a full clip of bullets at him.

23:31.140 --> 23:34.380
For some reason, the insurance company didn't like that.

23:34.380 --> 23:38.470
At number five is the most disturbing wet and wild myth ever,

23:39.690 --> 23:41.420
water torture.

23:42.430 --> 23:44.930
Tory and Scotty are going to

23:45.000 --> 23:46.260
make me cry today.

23:47.170 --> 23:49.170
The water torture myth is

23:49.240 --> 23:51.610
that dripping water on your head

23:51.680 --> 23:53.900
works sort of like how you see in nature

23:54.170 --> 23:56.160
where a waterfall can wear away at a rock,

23:56.980 --> 24:00.490
where it could drive you completely insane.

24:00.560 --> 24:03.690
Now, presented with this myth,

24:03.690 --> 24:07.510
did anybody really think about the fact that if we were successful,

24:07.580 --> 24:09.740
we were torturing ourself.

24:09.810 --> 24:10.770
I imagine I am going to fall

24:10.770 --> 24:12.530
asleep on this thing.

24:15.720 --> 24:17.060
Could you fall asleep?

24:17.120 --> 24:20.710
In the beginning, testing this myth seemed straightforward

24:20.810 --> 24:22.130
and pretty light hearted,

24:22.130 --> 24:24.150
considering the subject matter.

24:24.150 --> 24:25.610
So to test chinese water torture,

24:25.900 --> 24:28.590
Adam was robed, he served as the control,

24:29.050 --> 24:30.930
which meant he wasn't restrained

24:31.220 --> 24:35.820
but he did have to hold the same position for a long period of time.

24:35.910 --> 24:38.280
The fly is much worse than the water.

24:38.280 --> 24:41.180
So he did what any logical person would do.

24:41.250 --> 24:43.430
He wore his adult diapers.

24:45.920 --> 24:49.030
Lest anyone forget, there is no dignity on Mythbusters.

24:49.470 --> 24:54.320
Yes, it is true I wet myself during the course of testing that story.

24:54.320 --> 24:57.100
I was in the chair for so long,

24:57.100 --> 25:01.420
eventually, I could no longer restrain my own bladder.

25:01.420 --> 25:04.980
Oh, oh, oh my god.

25:09.460 --> 25:10.990
We learned something really interesting on the show,

25:11.060 --> 25:13.730
which is that adult diapers,

25:13.730 --> 25:15.760
they are not like baby diapers.

25:15.760 --> 25:17.650
Adult diapers are for leakage,

25:17.650 --> 25:19.060
not a full pee.

25:19.060 --> 25:21.230
I guess that's something to remember.

25:21.230 --> 25:23.460
Indeed. Based on Adam's experience,

25:23.920 --> 25:27.130
Kari wasn't too concerned whether it came to her turn.

25:27.130 --> 25:29.770
I can't even imagine this being for real.

25:29.840 --> 25:31.130
I am around people I am secure

25:31.130 --> 25:32.380
with and I totally trust.

25:32.380 --> 25:33.480
I know they are going to get me out of this.

25:33.480 --> 25:35.330
I have an ambulance standing by with paramedics.

25:35.670 --> 25:38.530
If this was for real, I would be screaming and struggling

25:38.870 --> 25:40.380
I'll probably have bloody wrists and ankles by now.

25:41.470 --> 25:42.820
But as it turned out

25:42.820 --> 25:44.160
Kari had seriously

25:44.160 --> 25:48.020
underestimated the power of that slow and steady drip.

25:48.020 --> 25:49.550
Are you getting upset and

25:49.620 --> 25:51.250
feel like you are going to panic?

25:51.320 --> 25:52.370
Extreme.

25:54.010 --> 25:54.670
You feel like you are going

25:54.670 --> 25:57.290
to fall apart and go to pieces?

25:58.010 --> 25:59.680
I actually don't want to do this test right now.

25:59.680 --> 26:00.610
Let's get her out.

26:00.680 --> 26:03.100
No, it's fine, give me a second, okay.

26:03.100 --> 26:04.800
I did tell them to continue even after

26:04.800 --> 26:05.860
they said to take me out.

26:05.930 --> 26:09.110
For me, I was trying to see it like climbing a mountain where

26:09.540 --> 26:11.930
it is hard but you can keep going on

26:12.260 --> 26:14.850
and it was really early on in my mythbusters career.

26:15.090 --> 26:17.290
I just had a sudden claustrophobia attack.

26:17.290 --> 26:18.650
That's what that was a minute ago.

26:18.720 --> 26:21.090
I wanted to prove myself.

26:21.090 --> 26:22.890
I didn't want to be a wimp and

26:22.960 --> 26:24.300
take myself out of the game.

26:24.360 --> 26:26.680
I think I was trying to walk it off.

26:26.680 --> 26:28.240
Probably not the best idea.

26:28.310 --> 26:29.780
You have proven yourself that

26:29.780 --> 26:31.580
you probably could stay here longer.

26:31.650 --> 26:34.400
But I am actually going to let you loose.

26:34.400 --> 26:35.620
One and a half hours later,

26:35.970 --> 26:39.450
it was clear they needed to not only end Kari's ordeal

26:39.850 --> 26:42.060
but to stop this myth all together.

26:42.460 --> 26:43.870
Normally, when we are doing a myth,

26:43.870 --> 26:47.040
you have to endure a lot of pain

26:47.040 --> 26:48.670
in order to gather enough data

26:48.740 --> 26:51.220
so that way you can either bust or confirm the myth.

26:51.220 --> 26:53.760
In that particular situation, it was so unbearable

26:54.100 --> 26:56.060
that we had to call it.

26:56.570 --> 26:58.930
What if asked to revisit myths

26:59.000 --> 27:00.310
and do them a little differently.

27:00.310 --> 27:02.710
I can guarantee you, I will

27:02.780 --> 27:06.600
never, never do water torture again.

27:06.600 --> 27:08.500
Next up in our splashdown,

27:08.500 --> 27:11.380
we put the wild into wet and wild.

27:11.380 --> 27:14.450
Then, I shot it.

27:19.720 --> 27:24.380
Next, we're taking a walk on the wet and wild side.

27:26.010 --> 27:27.240
From kissing dolphins

27:27.310 --> 27:29.010
That is so cool.

27:30.070 --> 27:31.290
Just a little clammy, a little wet

27:31.290 --> 27:33.630
but I mean you are making out with a fish.

27:33.630 --> 27:34.690
What do you want?

27:34.690 --> 27:37.350
to reanimating dead fish.

27:37.350 --> 27:39.150
Franken fish was pretty much like it sounds.

27:39.220 --> 27:43.960
I took a fish and brought it to life using electricity

27:46.340 --> 27:47.150
and then I shot it.

27:49.700 --> 27:51.010
The mythbusters have learned

27:51.010 --> 27:54.040
a lot from their brushes with aquatic life.

27:54.780 --> 27:57.040
I just found out that if you were holding on to a penguin,

27:57.040 --> 27:58.100
you have to wash your hands

27:58.100 --> 27:59.750
because you can get salmonella.

28:00.270 --> 28:03.330
But one experiment sticks in Adam's mind.

28:03.330 --> 28:06.140
One of my personal favorites for the best aquatic animal myth

28:06.140 --> 28:10.010
has to be one of the early ones, "Octopus Pregnancy".

28:10.010 --> 28:11.510
the question here was, whether or not

28:11.510 --> 28:14.940
you could accidentally swallow the fertilized egg of an octopus

28:15.360 --> 28:18.470
and bring it fully to term in your stomach.

28:19.140 --> 28:20.090
And to test that,

28:20.090 --> 28:24.630
they needed a close encounter of the octopus kind.

28:25.380 --> 28:29.510
Now it turns out, I, and I've met several octopi since then,

28:30.040 --> 28:32.530
have skin that octopi love.

28:33.730 --> 28:34.920
So cool!

28:34.920 --> 28:36.350
They love me.

28:36.350 --> 28:38.470
You must taste really good.

28:38.470 --> 28:40.300
'Cause he is really interested in you.

28:40.370 --> 28:41.610
We got along really well.

28:41.670 --> 28:43.210
He is very excited.

28:43.280 --> 28:44.710
I did have to explain to my wife

28:44.710 --> 28:47.660
why I had circular hickeys all the way up my arm,

28:47.660 --> 28:49.920
but there is nothing quite like

28:49.920 --> 28:52.560
getting so much affection from a cephalopod.

28:52.560 --> 28:54.220
It is amazing.

28:54.220 --> 28:58.310
It even squirted water playfully at me during our time together.

28:58.310 --> 28:59.410
I will never forget that.

29:00.260 --> 29:02.190
Number Three, it's all aboard

29:02.190 --> 29:04.190
for some boat destruction.

29:05.520 --> 29:07.660
Where there is water, there are boats.

29:08.680 --> 29:10.170
And where there is mythbusters,

29:10.170 --> 29:11.320
there is destruction.

29:13.370 --> 29:14.670
So if you put the two together,

29:14.670 --> 29:16.660
you have got boat destruction.

29:17.130 --> 29:20.860
But one cursed craft looms in their memories.

29:21.710 --> 29:23.900
We had a lot of frustrating moments on the show,

29:23.900 --> 29:27.320
but one that sticks out in my mind is "Bifurcated Boat."

29:27.320 --> 29:29.640
So "Bifurcated Boat" is about a boat

29:29.640 --> 29:32.910
that got split down the middle on a pole.

29:33.650 --> 29:36.530
Now, obviously you would think we'd test this

29:36.530 --> 29:37.770
with a boat on watter,

29:37.770 --> 29:39.430
but we couldn't.

29:39.430 --> 29:42.500
Because having a power boat on water

29:42.500 --> 29:44.500
that would potentially sink

29:44.570 --> 29:46.250
would create a ecological hazard.

29:46.250 --> 29:47.570
Are you trying to hold my hands?

29:48.070 --> 29:50.630
No. I am trying to hold on to something.

29:51.040 --> 29:53.720
So really, the best option that we had

29:53.720 --> 29:55.970
was to do this on land.

29:57.490 --> 29:59.260
Testing this myth out of the water 

29:59.260 --> 30:01.120
may have been good for the environment,

30:01.120 --> 30:03.680
but not for our mythbusters.

30:03.750 --> 30:05.650
From the very beginning, things started to go wrong.

30:05.720 --> 30:07.670
Let's start with the weather.

30:10.160 --> 30:12.220
I am so over this one.

30:12.220 --> 30:14.120
I'm pretty much over this one.

30:14.120 --> 30:18.080
And then, there was the instance of the blue rope.

30:18.400 --> 30:21.970
With the light fading and time running out,

30:22.430 --> 30:24.260
the breakaway broke.

30:24.260 --> 30:25.260
Do we lose a cable?

30:26.080 --> 30:28.190
Cable broke.

30:28.190 --> 30:30.060
So apparently did the team.

30:30.130 --> 30:31.790
So for all the other things

30:31.790 --> 30:33.760
where we tow you something big

30:33.760 --> 30:36.070
into something else and crash it,

30:36.070 --> 30:38.240
we use a breakaway rope.

30:38.310 --> 30:40.340
There is a standard one that we have been using,

30:40.340 --> 30:42.220
which is a blue marine rope.

30:42.220 --> 30:42.740
Grant is sitting there.

30:42.740 --> 30:45.310
He is like, Tory gave me this piece of rope.

30:45.310 --> 30:47.110
We always use blue rope, not this stuff.

30:47.180 --> 30:51.350
On this particular one, Tory didn't want to use that.

30:51.350 --> 30:52.790
He wanted to use this.

30:52.790 --> 30:54.810
Grant says one thing.

30:54.810 --> 30:56.490
Tory says another thing.

30:56.490 --> 30:58.810
Moments before that, I showed him the rope.

30:58.810 --> 30:59.960
He is like, yeah, that will work.

31:00.400 --> 31:01.530
So I don't understand

31:01.530 --> 31:04.400
what happened between that moment and that moment.

31:04.400 --> 31:05.700
I think what we are going to do

31:05.770 --> 31:10.360
is go back to what we used to use that was working.

31:11.700 --> 31:13.760
Dude, we have never used the blue rope.

31:13.760 --> 31:14.630
We always used the blue rope.

31:14.630 --> 31:17.130
No, we haven't, not with a breakaway.

31:17.200 --> 31:18.240
Yes, we do.

31:18.300 --> 31:19.440
No, we don't.

31:19.440 --> 31:21.050
So I think that the fun was when

31:21.270 --> 31:24.570
we each have a different recollection of what happened.

31:24.570 --> 31:26.520
All I know is to this day,

31:26.520 --> 31:28.440
someone in the office would yell,

31:28.440 --> 31:30.490
"We always use the blue rope."

31:31.110 --> 31:33.100
15 miles per hour.

31:33.100 --> 31:34.350
On day two,

31:34.350 --> 31:36.530
with the blue rope controversy behind them,

31:36.530 --> 31:40.250
the team tried again.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.700
And again.

31:49.620 --> 31:52.820
Well, it didn't bifurcate but it was still pretty cool.

31:52.820 --> 31:56.280
But nothing could get the "mythity split" to split.

31:56.280 --> 31:58.760
So what we decided to take the crane,

31:58.760 --> 32:01.240
raise up the boat as high as it can go,

32:01.240 --> 32:04.210
maybe like 90 feet and drop it nose first.

32:04.280 --> 32:05.870
Go, go, go, go, go.

32:05.870 --> 32:07.210
It smashed on to the tarmac.

32:07.270 --> 32:09.580
We were like, yeah!

32:13.110 --> 32:14.660
Just when we thought we were done.

32:14.660 --> 32:19.420
And we were going to take our revenge on the bifurcated boat.

32:19.420 --> 32:22.630
Apparently the bifurcated boat had other plans

32:22.630 --> 32:24.670
and took revenge on us.

32:24.670 --> 32:26.320
We are in so much trouble.

32:26.320 --> 32:28.030
We are kind of in trouble.

32:28.030 --> 32:32.130
It was just all together a really disastrous experiment.

32:32.130 --> 32:35.200
Next up, the mythbusters darkest hour.

32:35.200 --> 32:37.000
You are pretty much bait.

32:37.060 --> 32:40.210
And find out or splashtacular wet and wild.

32:40.210 --> 32:41.110
Number One.

32:45.780 --> 32:47.260
Coming in at number two,

32:47.260 --> 32:51.440
our unforgettable encounters with nature's deadliest catch.

32:53.670 --> 32:55.160
We have done so many shark myths,

32:55.160 --> 32:58.670
it's absolutely impossible to pick one that's the all-time favorite.

32:59.860 --> 33:01.550
Something just touched me!

33:01.790 --> 33:03.490
So we're all gonna do this individually.

33:04.070 --> 33:05.420
Yep, just when they thought

33:05.420 --> 33:07.250
it was safe to go back in the water-

33:07.250 --> 33:08.470
Oh, my lord!

33:08.470 --> 33:10.470
It was like arrgh.

33:11.080 --> 33:12.890
The mythbusters are reliving

33:12.890 --> 33:15.530
their most memorable shark moments.

33:15.530 --> 33:18.380
And to kick us off is Adam's favorite

33:18.380 --> 33:20.380
straight from the shark's mouth.

33:22.360 --> 33:24.170
This is my favorite thing we've ever made.

33:24.170 --> 33:25.970
My favorite shark moment on the show

33:25.970 --> 33:28.550
does not involve a real life shark.

33:28.550 --> 33:30.750
It involves our robo shark.

33:38.160 --> 33:39.230
That is so perfect.

33:39.290 --> 33:41.660
That thing, that robot is not only

33:41.660 --> 33:44.020
one of the most beautiful things we have ever built.

33:46.790 --> 33:48.080
It's time to go swimming.

33:48.080 --> 33:50.240
It's time for his first meal.

33:50.720 --> 33:52.050
Both beautiful in its execution

33:52.050 --> 33:54.680
and beautiful to watch it move in the water.

33:54.680 --> 33:55.810
Go.

33:59.650 --> 34:01.590
It's like the best toy ever.

34:02.500 --> 34:06.330
But seriously, being in its jaws while it's thrashing me about

34:06.330 --> 34:08.600
trying to poke its eyes out,

34:14.440 --> 34:16.710
it really satisfies something inside of me

34:16.710 --> 34:21.620
like this early seven-year-old Adam's desire to be in an action movie.

34:24.570 --> 34:27.550
Adam's creature feature was impressive,

34:27.550 --> 34:29.710
but Jamie's most memorable moment 

34:29.710 --> 34:33.239
was dicing with danger in a dingy.

34:33.239 --> 34:35.750
The idea here was that a fish that had been wounded

34:35.750 --> 34:38.860
would thrash around and attract the attention of sharks.

34:38.860 --> 34:41.500
And so, of course, I decided to test this

34:41.500 --> 34:44.060
by getting into an inflatable toy boat...

34:44.060 --> 34:45.969
Okay, flapping fish.

34:47.620 --> 34:49.310
and going out into the middle of a bunch of sharks

34:49.310 --> 34:51.000
and slapping my oars

34:51.000 --> 34:53.360
to see whether it attracted them more.

35:00.190 --> 35:01.480
It did.

35:02.490 --> 35:05.490
Of course, that made our dive master kind of nervous for some reason.

35:05.560 --> 35:06.590
I don't know why.

35:06.590 --> 35:08.750
But I was having a great old time.

35:08.750 --> 35:10.290
There we go.

35:10.290 --> 35:12.080
That's what I'm talking about.

35:12.080 --> 35:13.600
It was one of those things that

35:13.600 --> 35:15.440
you just don't see that every day, 

35:15.440 --> 35:17.840
at least not to live through it.

35:18.440 --> 35:22.170
Stirring up a shark frenzy in an inflatable was crazy,

35:23.100 --> 35:25.460
but for our intrepid trio,

35:25.460 --> 35:29.680
one moment was so terrifying, that they all picked it.

35:31.550 --> 35:32.670
Now we are testing the myth,

35:33.020 --> 35:34.860
do flash lights attract sharks.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.970
Now, obiviuosly, you can't test that in the daylight,

35:37.030 --> 35:38.720
so we had to do night dives.

35:38.720 --> 35:40.420
See you back on the surface.

35:40.420 --> 35:42.650
Try not to get eaton.

35:43.380 --> 35:45.530
Night diving alone is scary.

35:46.110 --> 35:49.740
Night diving with sharks is terrifying.

35:50.180 --> 35:52.600
During the day, it is fine.

35:52.600 --> 35:55.180
I mean, you can see the sharks, they can see you.

35:56.280 --> 35:57.590
But at night,

35:58.830 --> 36:00.010
all bets are off.

36:00.020 --> 36:03.630
It is a little scary down here.

36:03.630 --> 36:05.850
You can't see anything down there.

36:05.850 --> 36:07.150
They have all the advantages

36:07.250 --> 36:11.520
and you, you are pretty much bait.

36:15.200 --> 36:17.510
I have a lot of activity down here.

36:17.510 --> 36:18.780
We were in the dark.

36:18.850 --> 36:20.800
We were at depth.

36:20.800 --> 36:24.990
Definitely this is quite and creeping me out.

36:24.990 --> 36:28.700
We might as well been holding handfuls of chum.

36:28.700 --> 36:30.400
Holy crap!

36:30.470 --> 36:32.290
Pursue and circling.

36:33.370 --> 36:35.200
They got so aggressive.

36:35.270 --> 36:36.610
They actually came right into my face.

36:36.670 --> 36:39.930
I had to push one away with the flash light.

36:42.570 --> 36:44.040
Oh, my gosh.

36:44.110 --> 36:44.950
All of the sudden,

36:44.950 --> 36:47.530
the dive master gets this look in his face

36:47.530 --> 36:49.200
and gives everybody the signals

36:49.200 --> 36:51.090
to get back on the boat.

36:51.500 --> 36:54.180
When he does that, your blood runs cold.

36:54.750 --> 36:57.020
I was the last to get back on to the boat

36:57.020 --> 36:58.250
and I was like, "What's going on?"

36:58.320 --> 36:59.540
"Why are we getting on to the boat?"

36:59.540 --> 37:02.860
He said, oh, yeah, tiger shark came around.

37:02.860 --> 37:05.780
You know that chain meling you are wearing, wouldn't help.

37:05.780 --> 37:07.290
Snaps your arm right off.

37:07.290 --> 37:08.850
I got on the boat so fast

37:08.850 --> 37:10.540
I think might have actually leapt out of

37:10.610 --> 37:12.440
the water on to the boat.

37:15.570 --> 37:19.110
There is no doubt that during all their encounters,

37:20.510 --> 37:22.300
I guess they are hungry today.

37:22.300 --> 37:25.120
these infamous fish have terrified our hosts.

37:25.120 --> 37:27.740
Why the hell are we doing this?

37:27.740 --> 37:30.650
But they have also come to respect them.

37:31.130 --> 37:32.730
There is one more thing I got to say,

37:32.730 --> 37:36.020
that is that we and a lot of other shows make a big drama

37:36.020 --> 37:38.760
about sharks and how dangerous they are and everything.

37:38.760 --> 37:41.340
But, the realility is that more

37:41.340 --> 37:44.120
people die in their bathrooms by like

37:44.120 --> 37:45.730
slipping and falling and hitting

37:45.730 --> 37:49.570
their heads on the toilet or something than are killed by sharks.

37:49.570 --> 37:54.170
Yet, we are killing sharks by the millions for stuff like

37:54.170 --> 37:56.860
shark fin soup or some other stupid thing.

37:56.860 --> 37:58.940
So let's stop doing that, okay?

37:58.940 --> 38:00.850
sharks are really cool.

38:02.120 --> 38:03.520
Folks, we are gonna need a

38:03.520 --> 38:05.350
bigger boat, because this is our

38:05.350 --> 38:08.080
wettest and wildest moment.

38:10.300 --> 38:14.100
After the spills, chills, and thrills,

38:14.170 --> 38:18.090
we're ending with an ingenious build.

38:18.090 --> 38:19.930
it may be because Jamie is a

38:19.930 --> 38:22.670
salty sea dog of salty sea dogs

38:22.670 --> 38:25.080
and I love making anything I can.

38:25.570 --> 38:28.380
We love making our own boats.

38:28.380 --> 38:30.190
Hurry up, they are coming.

38:32.590 --> 38:36.640
The escape boat was made out of raincoats and was inflatable.

38:36.750 --> 38:40.260
The duct tape boat was made out of duct tape, of course.

38:42.120 --> 38:44.140
The air cylinder speed boat was

38:44.140 --> 38:45.780
made out of a speed boat that

38:45.850 --> 38:47.270
was powered by air cylinders.

38:47.570 --> 38:49.770
It didn't do anything really important,

38:50.100 --> 38:51.660
but it was cool-looking.

38:51.660 --> 38:53.410
but, shiver me timbers,

38:53.410 --> 38:57.070
if this isn't the most novel boat build of all.

38:57.140 --> 38:58.450
Drum roll, please.

38:59.200 --> 39:00.260
The Pykrete boat.

39:01.240 --> 39:03.910
Pykrete is something had been on Jamie's mental list

39:03.910 --> 39:06.880
for years before we tested it.

39:07.260 --> 39:08.940
And then we were asked to go back to

39:08.940 --> 39:10.540
Alaska a second time to do

39:10.540 --> 39:12.910
another Alaska special.

39:12.970 --> 39:14.450
Then, Jamie mentioned the Pykrete boat

39:14.450 --> 39:17.850
and it was one of those moments where we all realized instantly,

39:17.850 --> 39:20.550
this is the myth we have to test.

39:20.550 --> 39:24.250
This is Pykrete. Aircraft carriers.

39:24.250 --> 39:25.720
The myth here was based on an idea

39:25.720 --> 39:27.580
that somebody had around world War II

39:27.650 --> 39:28.970
that you could build an

39:28.970 --> 39:32.080
aircraft carrier out of sawdust and water.

39:32.080 --> 39:33.740
Sawdust and water,

39:33.740 --> 39:37.060
but with a typically mythbusters twist.

39:37.540 --> 39:40.280
We stumbled upon newspaper as

39:40.280 --> 39:42.230
an ideal replacement for sawdust.

39:42.230 --> 39:43.870
I love wet newspapers.

39:44.130 --> 39:47.010
Especially for building a shell boat

39:47.010 --> 39:48.670
like we finally built.

39:48.740 --> 39:52.220
With the kids at Catch Can high taking care of the paperwork,

39:52.220 --> 39:56.790
all Adam and Jamie had to do was craft the scoop of the century.

39:57.860 --> 39:59.770
We are going to be layering in the newspapers,

39:59.770 --> 40:02.530
layer overlayer like the shingles of a roof

40:02.530 --> 40:06.860
where all the open sides point away from the direction of travel.

40:07.290 --> 40:09.300
I feel like I'm working in a swamp.

40:09.300 --> 40:11.100
After a back-breaking build,

40:11.100 --> 40:13.190
the boat was put on ice.

40:15.170 --> 40:18.480
It is an ice boat and it is a nice boat.

40:18.880 --> 40:19.710
Get it?

40:19.710 --> 40:20.940
Yeah, I got it.

40:21.330 --> 40:23.230
The mythbusters were ready for launch

40:23.650 --> 40:27.190
but would it sail or become yesterday's news?

40:31.290 --> 40:32.770
You and I are pushing. Ready?

40:32.770 --> 40:35.560
It is funny that Alcatraz and the pykrete boat

40:35.560 --> 40:39.040
both have moments that are quite similar.

40:40.140 --> 40:40.870
Look at that.

40:40.870 --> 40:45.050
The very first time we placed each of those boats in the water,

40:45.060 --> 40:48.270
we weren't sure whether there would be total failure

40:48.270 --> 40:49.990
Go, Jamie.

40:49.990 --> 40:51.260
You are the man, buddy.

40:51.330 --> 40:52.230
Come on, baby.

40:53.240 --> 40:55.340
or maybe it would last a little while.

40:55.340 --> 40:57.300
Do you realize what this is?

40:57.370 --> 41:00.030
A maiden voyage of yesterday's news.

41:00.030 --> 41:00.960
Iced newspaper.

41:01.030 --> 41:01.790
Let's go.

41:01.860 --> 41:03.670
In neither case, did we expect the boat to be

41:03.670 --> 41:06.680
as sea worthy as it turned out to be.

41:07.060 --> 41:08.460
When I put that boat in the water,

41:08.460 --> 41:09.230
I knew I had a choice.

41:09.450 --> 41:12.060
I could either take it easy and try not to break the thing

41:12.230 --> 41:15.630
or I could just gun it and see whether it worked.

41:19.700 --> 41:21.160
I decided to do the latter,

41:21.160 --> 41:23.360
because the clock was ticking.

41:23.430 --> 41:25.710
And that thing was going to melt.

41:25.710 --> 41:27.710
It was then or never.

41:27.780 --> 41:29.910
I'm king of the world.

41:33.120 --> 41:34.630
I really like this story,

41:34.630 --> 41:36.510
because it exemplifies what I like to see

41:36.510 --> 41:37.900
come out of mythbusters.

41:37.900 --> 41:40.390
We have to keep it afloat.

41:40.390 --> 41:43.680
That is that we start with a simple seed of an idea.

41:43.680 --> 41:46.320
This might be good or maybe not

41:46.320 --> 41:50.500
but eventually, we take it some place that it has never gone before

41:50.500 --> 41:54.900
and in this case, we were able to make a frozen speed boat.

41:54.900 --> 41:56.170
It actually worked.

41:58.060 --> 41:59.190
I don't want to get all misty on you

41:59.190 --> 42:01.890
but it is a pleasure building strange craft with you.
