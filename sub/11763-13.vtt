WEBVTT

00:01.132 --> 00:04.035
IT'S DAYLIGHT.
WHY AREN'T YOU AT MY HOUSE YET?

00:04.035 --> 00:07.578
TODAY IS BIG PRESENT DAY. I HAVE
TO GO GET MYSELF A BIG PRESENT.
IS ANDY GOING WITH YOU?

00:07.578 --> 00:11.412
NO, HE DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT IT.
WELL, YOU'RE COMING OVER LATER
FOR MOVIE NIGHT, RIGHT?

00:11.412 --> 00:13.684
I DON'T KNOW.

00:13.684 --> 00:15.416
ELLIE... FRIEND TEST.

00:15.416 --> 00:18.589
FINE, I'LL COME.
(grunts)

00:18.589 --> 00:19.690
FRIEND TEST?

00:19.690 --> 00:21.692
YEAH. IT'S WHEN YOU CALL

00:21.692 --> 00:24.295
YOUR ENTIRE FRIENDSHIP
INTO QUESTION

00:24.295 --> 00:28.259
AND FORCE THEM INTO DOING
SOMETHING. I CAME UP WITH IT.
SOUNDS LIKE YOU.
MOM, I'M TRYING TO FIX THE TV,

00:28.259 --> 00:32.663
BUT I NEED TO KNOW
WHAT YOU DID TO BREAK IT.
I JUST PUSHED ONE OF THE BUTTONS
ON THE REMOTE,

00:32.663 --> 00:34.305
AND IT WENT TO BLACK.
MM-HMM. AND THEN?

00:34.305 --> 00:37.308
AFTER IT WENT BLACK, I PUSHED
ABOUT A HUNDRED OTHER BUTTONS,

00:37.308 --> 00:40.811
AND THEN I PLUGGED
AND RE-PLUGGED A BUNCH OF WIRES.
FIX IT, T-REX.
I'M PUMPED TO SEE THIS MOVIE.

00:40.811 --> 00:42.543
"WAITING FOR SUPERMAN."
REALLY?

00:42.543 --> 00:44.545
BOBBY,
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THIS,

00:44.545 --> 00:47.047
BUT SUPERMAN'S NOT IN IT.
IT'S...

00:47.047 --> 00:48.819
IT'S A DOCUMENTARY.

00:48.819 --> 00:50.821
NO!
YEP.

00:50.821 --> 00:53.824
IT'S A BIRD, IT'S A PLANE--
NO, IT'S A DEPRESSING EXPOSГ©

00:53.824 --> 00:56.157
ABOUT THE FAILING
PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM.

00:56.157 --> 00:58.559
OH, MAN. WELL, DID YOU SEE
THE WHOLE THING?

00:58.559 --> 01:01.562
'CAUSE MAYBE SUPERMAN FLIES IN
AT THE END.
HE DOESN'T.
BUT IT'S STILL GOOD.

01:01.562 --> 01:04.565
TOM, I KNOW YOU WANNA BE
A PART OF THIS GROUP,

01:04.565 --> 01:06.837
BUT HOVERING OUT THERE
EAVESDROPPING

01:06.837 --> 01:08.839
IS NOT THE WAY TO DO IT.
EAVESDROPPING?

01:08.839 --> 01:11.302
(chuckles nervously)
THAT'S CRAZY.
WHAT WERE YOU DOING?

01:11.302 --> 01:15.576
UH... LOOKING FOR MY CAT.
(clicking teeth) SNOWBALL?

01:15.576 --> 01:17.578
I SHOULD GO.

01:20.311 --> 01:22.413
TOM.

01:22.413 --> 01:24.285
ANY SIGN OF HIM?

01:24.285 --> 01:26.687
OH, BOY.

01:26.687 --> 01:29.560
(horn honks in distance)
OH, HELLO, JULES.

01:29.560 --> 01:32.823
I JUST FINISHED
THE TASTIEST CUBAN SANDWICH.

01:32.823 --> 01:34.825
BARB, I'M GONNA STOP YOU
RIGHT THERE

01:34.825 --> 01:37.428
AND ASSUME THAT YOU'RE NOT
TALKING ABOUT YOUR LUNCH

01:37.428 --> 01:40.431
BUT RATHER TWO YOUNG CUBAN BOYS
THAT DIDHORRIBLETHINGS TO YOU.

01:40.431 --> 01:43.834
HECTOR AND JULIO, YES.
YES, THEY'RE COUSINS.

01:43.834 --> 01:46.437
WHY ME? WHY DO YOU
WANNA TORTURE ME

01:46.437 --> 01:47.838
WITH YOUR FILTHY STORIES?

01:47.838 --> 01:50.711
YOU USED TO BE ONE OF US--
STALKING YOUNG PREY

01:50.711 --> 01:52.713
WITHOUT MERCY OR SHAME.

01:52.713 --> 01:54.715
WHEN ARE PEOPLE
GOING TO UNDERSTAND

01:54.715 --> 01:56.717
THAT'S NOT WHO I AM ANYMORE?

01:56.717 --> 02:00.891
I MEAN, WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO,
CHANGE MY NAME?

02:00.891 --> 02:02.493
YOU'LL BE BACK.

02:02.493 --> 02:04.725
THE FILTH IS STRONG
WITHIN YOU.

02:04.725 --> 02:06.727
(horn honking tune of "Dixie")

02:06.727 --> 02:08.859
CHECK OUT MY NEW RIDE.

02:08.859 --> 02:10.631
WHOO-HOO!

02:10.631 --> 02:13.334
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

02:13.334 --> 02:16.337
THAT'S MY TRUCKER "WHOO."
YOU DO IT.
NOT A CHANCE.

02:16.337 --> 02:17.568
FRIEND TEST.

02:17.568 --> 02:20.711
FINE. A-WHOO-HOO!

02:22.173 --> 02:24.175
WHAT?

02:24.175 --> 02:25.746
WHOO-HOO!

02:25.746 --> 02:28.219
WHOO-HOO!
WHOO-HOO!

02:28.219 --> 02:29.450
PLEASE STOP DOING THAT.
(cell phone alert chimes)

02:29.450 --> 02:32.623
OH. HEY.
SAM'S GOT A NEW HAIRCUT.

02:32.623 --> 02:35.456
WHO'S SAM AND WHAT SHOULD
I TEXT HIM BACK?

02:35.456 --> 02:37.758
S-SAM'S A BUDDY.
"SEND US A PIC OF YOUR HAIRCUT

02:37.758 --> 02:40.761
SO WE CAN JUDGE WHETHER
IT IS HOT OR NOT."

02:40.761 --> 02:42.863
OH, GOOD,
IT'S MY EX-BOYFRIEND SMITH.

02:42.863 --> 02:45.236
HEY, LAURIE. OH.

02:45.236 --> 02:48.369
IT'S A FOREARM KISS.
JUST AS CORDIAL. (chuckles)

02:48.369 --> 02:49.770
в™Єв™Єв™Є

02:49.770 --> 02:53.344
OKAY. I'LL LEAVE SO YOU CAN ALL
SAY HORRIBLE THINGS ABOUT ME.

02:53.344 --> 02:55.746
OH, NO, SMITH. I MEAN,
WE'RE ON LAURIE'S SIDE,

02:55.746 --> 02:57.748
BUT YOU'RE A GOOD GUY.

02:57.748 --> 02:59.480
THANKS.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.482
ALL RIGHT, LET ME GET
THE BALL ROLLING.

03:01.482 --> 03:04.485
HE IS A PALE-FACED JERK.
TOOL BAG.

03:04.485 --> 03:07.358
HE WASWAYTOO GOOD FOR YOU.

03:07.358 --> 03:11.191
DON'T HARSH ON SMITH.
HE JUST BOUGHT YOU ALL REFILLS.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.493
HMM.

03:12.493 --> 03:15.326
I CHARGED HIM DOUBLE,
THE PRETENTIOUS LITTLE DINK.

03:15.326 --> 03:17.728
YOU GUYS!

03:18.869 --> 03:21.372
NO LOOK.

03:21.372 --> 03:23.874
(clank)
(all) PENNY CAN!

03:23.874 --> 03:26.477
SCHOOLED BY A CHICK.
THIS IS EMBARRASSING.

03:26.477 --> 03:28.879
IT'S WORSE FOR ANDY.
HE'S MISSED SO MANY TIMES,

03:28.879 --> 03:31.742
HE CAN'T EVEN PLAY
REAL PENNY CAN.

03:31.742 --> 03:32.743
(clank)

03:32.743 --> 03:34.645
(high-pitched voice)
PENNY CAN!

03:34.645 --> 03:38.489
NO. WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SING
WHEN YOU GET IT IN THE BIG ONE?

03:38.489 --> 03:39.890
(normal voice) в™Є SISSY CAN в™Є
MM-HMM.

03:39.890 --> 03:41.352
(chuckles)

03:41.352 --> 03:43.494
STOP SUCKING SO MUCH,DUDE.

03:43.494 --> 03:45.896
PENNY CAN IS ONE PART GEOMETRY,
ONE PART MARKSMANSHIP,

03:45.896 --> 03:47.898
AND ONE PART CORE STRENGTH.

03:47.898 --> 03:50.901
NOW YOU GOT THE FIRST TWO
IN SPADES, BUT THIS RIGHT HERE--

03:50.901 --> 03:53.233
AH-WOKKA-WOKKA-WOKKA-
WOKKA-WOKKA.

03:53.233 --> 03:56.236
THAT'S HOLDING YOU BACK
IN THE MINORS, BRUH.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

03:56.236 --> 03:58.769
I DON'T HAVE TO TAKE
THIS CRAP FROM YOU.

03:58.769 --> 04:01.642
I'M GRABBING MY PENNY CAN,
AND I'M GOING HOME.
(coins clatter)

04:01.642 --> 04:04.615
WE WERE ALL TALKING SMACK.
WHY'S HE ONLY GOING OFF ON ME?

04:04.615 --> 04:06.877
HE'LL BE FINE.
CHECK THIS OUT.

04:06.877 --> 04:08.619
(clank)

04:08.619 --> 04:11.352
(all, high-pitched voices)
MOVING TARGET PENNY CAN!

04:11.352 --> 04:13.484
(loud clatter)

04:13.484 --> 04:16.026
(laughs)
OH! BOBBY,
DO YOU HAVE ANY CLEAN SHIRTS?

04:16.026 --> 04:18.629
I'VE GOT SHIRTS. WHY?

04:18.629 --> 04:21.932
OH. HEY THERE, FELLA.

04:21.932 --> 04:25.636
YOU KNOW, BUYING THAT RIG
IS JUST THE BEGINNING.

04:25.636 --> 04:28.499
I'M GONNA GO BALLS TO THE WALL
WITH THIS TOMBOY THING.

04:28.499 --> 04:32.773
WHAT UP, BROSEPH?
WEIRD. MOM, THIS IS TAKING
A WHILE TO FIX.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.775
I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE

04:34.775 --> 04:36.777
TO WATCH THAT DOCUMENTARY
TONIGHT.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.779
DAMN IT! I WANTED
TO FEEL SMART TONIGHT--

04:38.779 --> 04:40.781
SMART AND DEPRESSED
ABOUT THE WORLD,

04:40.781 --> 04:44.655
NOT DUMB AND HAPPY LIKE ALWAYS.
MAN, THOSE ARE SOME BIG GRAPES.

04:44.655 --> 04:46.817
DO YOU KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD DO?
(whispers) WHAT?

04:46.817 --> 04:49.820
LET'S ALL PILE IN THE BACK
OF MY PICKUP TRUCK

04:49.820 --> 04:53.394
AND MAKE OUR OWN ROADS
IN THE FOREST BEHIND THE MALL.
I'LL DO THAT.

04:53.394 --> 04:55.696
ALL RIGHT, BUBBA GUMP.
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY GOING

04:55.696 --> 04:58.369
THROUGH SOMETHING, AND WE'RE
HERE FOR YOU, BUT STILL,

04:58.369 --> 05:01.632
ANYONE HAVE AGOODIDEA?
WELL, WE ACTUALLY READ THIS
GREAT ARTICLE IN MY PSYCH CLASS

05:01.632 --> 05:03.374
ABOUT HOW--
ALL RIGHT, I WANNA
GET A GRAPE.

05:03.374 --> 05:05.806
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY!
STAY WITH ME.
WHAT?

05:05.806 --> 05:09.640
IT'S ABOUT HOWADULTSCAN REDUCE
THEIR STRESS LEVELS BY EMBRACING

05:09.640 --> 05:12.042
THE ACTIVITIES THEY LOVED
WHEN THEY WERE LITTLE KIDS.

05:12.042 --> 05:14.044
SO WE SHOULD ALL GO HIDE
IN THE SHOWER

05:14.044 --> 05:17.047
AND WATCH MY BABYSITTER PEE?
NO, NO, NO, THIS IS GOOD.
I MEAN, NOT YOUR THING.

05:17.047 --> 05:19.790
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO TALK
TO A PROFESSIONAL ABOUTTHAT.

05:19.790 --> 05:21.952
BUT I GOT A GREAT IDEA.
OH, WHO'S THAT DUDE?

05:21.952 --> 05:23.554
YOUR WIFE.

05:23.554 --> 05:25.926
IS THAT BOBBY'S SHIRT?
THAT'S RIGHT.

05:25.926 --> 05:28.829
YEAH, I'VE HAD THIS DREAM.

05:30.401 --> 05:33.063
(door creaks open)

05:33.063 --> 05:35.406
WHOA! BOBBY,
LET THE GIRL BREATHE.

05:35.406 --> 05:37.808
WHAT, YOU JUST GET ON THE BOAT
WITHOUT KNOCKIN'?

05:37.808 --> 05:41.111
I MEAN, THERE'S AN AIR HORN
ON THE LADDER FOR A REASON.
HI. I'M SAM.

05:41.111 --> 05:45.576
THIS IS SAM? MM!
I PICTURED HIM WITH LESS BOOBS.

05:45.576 --> 05:47.948
DID SHE SAY "HIM"?
IT'S A FIGURE OF SPEECH.

05:47.948 --> 05:50.851
(air horn blares)
WHAT?

05:50.851 --> 05:53.424
SEE? THAT'S THE PIZZA GUY.
HE'S GOT MANNERS.
(exhales deeply)

05:53.424 --> 05:54.785
(blaring continues)

05:54.785 --> 05:56.527
BUTNO PATIENCE.

05:58.058 --> 06:00.661
(lowered voice)
DON'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT SAM.

06:00.661 --> 06:03.664
OKAY, GUYS, WE COULD ALL USE
A LITTLE "ACT LIKE A KID" TIME,

06:03.664 --> 06:06.066
SO WE'RE GONNA PLAY
SARDINES IN A CAN.

06:06.066 --> 06:08.068
AND ONE PERSON GOES TO HIDE,

06:08.068 --> 06:11.071
AND THEN EVERYONE LOOKS
FOR THEM, BUT HERE'S THE CATCH.

06:11.071 --> 06:13.674
IF YOU FIND THE HIDER,
YOU HIDE WITH THEM,

06:13.674 --> 06:16.677
AND THEN THE LAST PERSON
LEFT LOOKING IS THE LOSER.

06:16.677 --> 06:19.680
HOW FUN DOES THAT SOUND?

06:20.951 --> 06:22.953
LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

06:22.953 --> 06:26.557
INSTEAD OF DOING FUN STUFF
WITH MY NEW TRUCK...
YOU BOUGHT A TRUCK?

06:26.557 --> 06:27.818
LATER.
SUPER.

06:27.818 --> 06:29.960
WE'RE GONNA PLAY
SOME LAME VERSION

06:29.960 --> 06:32.563
OF HIDE-AND-SEEK?
DON'T BE ALL SULKY JUST 'CAUSE

06:32.563 --> 06:35.696
YOU'RE NOT GETTING YOUR WAY
FOR ONCE.
HAIL MARY TO SAVE THE NIGHT--

06:35.696 --> 06:38.699
I, AT MY PLACE, HAVE
A FABULOUS BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE,

06:38.699 --> 06:41.702
TWO THICK, BIG, JUICY STEAKS.
I COULD COOK 'EM UP.
I'M IN.

06:41.702 --> 06:45.075
TALKING TO JULES.
WE'RE PLAYING SARDINES IN A CAN.

06:45.075 --> 06:49.079
NOW THE MORE THE MERRIER,
SO WE CAN ASK TOM TO PLAY.
AH, I'D LOVE TO.

06:49.079 --> 06:51.942
WAY TO KEEP IT WEIRD, TOM.
WHOEVER'S HIDING CAN HIDE

06:51.942 --> 06:53.944
ANYWHERE
IN OR AROUND THIS HOUSE,

06:53.944 --> 06:56.687
ELLIE AND ANDY'S, OR GRAYSON'S.
I'LL HIDE.

06:56.687 --> 07:00.721
OH. WAY TO BOUNCE BACK. WHEN YOU
FIND YOUR SPOT, CALL US.

07:00.721 --> 07:03.594
TOM, I DIDN'T INCLUDE YOUR HOUSE
AS A PLACE TO HIDE

07:03.594 --> 07:06.597
BECAUSE I JUST FIGURED
IT WAS CREEPY IN THERE.
PRETTY MUCH.

07:06.597 --> 07:08.599
I CAN SEE HIS GUEST ROOM
FROM UPSTAIRS.

07:08.599 --> 07:11.131
THERE'S A MANNEQUIN
IN A DOG CAGE.

07:11.131 --> 07:13.704
(telephone rings)
OH! HERE WE GO. ALL RIGHT.

07:13.704 --> 07:15.706
(beep)
ELLIE, YOU ARE ON SPEAKER.

07:15.706 --> 07:16.967
(Ellie) Good.

07:16.967 --> 07:19.439
JULES, YOU ALWAYS ACT LIKE
I'M THE CHOREY ONE

07:19.439 --> 07:21.842
WHO HAS TO GET HER OWN WAY,
BUT THE TRUTH IS,

07:21.842 --> 07:23.974
youare the bossy-pants
control freak

07:23.974 --> 07:26.577
WHO MAKES EVERYONE DO
WHATYOUWANT THEM TO DO

07:26.577 --> 07:29.119
LIKE SOME EVIL DICTATOR.
DAMN!

07:29.119 --> 07:31.982
THANK YOU, JELLYBEAN.
SERIOUSLY, JULES,

07:31.982 --> 07:35.125
WHO ELECTEDYOUGROUP LEADER?
WELL, I HAVE SOMETHING
TO SAY ABOUT THAT.

07:35.125 --> 07:38.128
THAT'S WHY I HID. I KNEW
YOU'D WANNA DEFEND YOURSELF,

07:38.128 --> 07:40.130
BUT NOW YOU CAN'T.
ELLIE!

07:40.130 --> 07:41.862
GOOD-BYE.
(beep)

07:41.862 --> 07:43.834
(dial tone, beep)
OH, MY GOD.

07:43.834 --> 07:45.235
UHH!
(glass shatters)

07:45.235 --> 07:46.867
AAH!
(telephone clatters)

07:46.867 --> 07:48.869
GAME ON!
YEAH!

07:48.869 --> 07:50.971
(Grayson) SOUNDS GOOD.
(Laurie) EXCUSE ME.

07:50.971 --> 07:55.976
в™Єв™Єв™Є

08:02.152 --> 08:04.254
I TOLD YOU ELLIE
WASN'T IN THE POOL SHED.

08:04.254 --> 08:07.257
WELL, IT WAS A GOOD GUESS.
THAT'S WHERE SHE HIDES FROM ANDY

08:07.257 --> 08:09.720
WHEN HE WANTS TO HAVE SEX.
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT CRAP

08:09.720 --> 08:13.023
SHE SAID ABOUT ME?
I THINK I'LL PASS ON GETTING
IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR FIGHT.

08:13.023 --> 08:16.026
SMART MOVE, BOY TOY.
OH, TRAVIS, YOU HEARD
WHAT ELLIE SAID.

08:16.026 --> 08:19.770
I MEAN, DO YOU THINK
THAT I'M AT ALL--
NO. MNH-MNH. I AIN'T STUPID.

08:19.770 --> 08:22.773
YOU CALL YOURSELF MEN,
BUT YOU'RE BOTH WUSSES.

08:22.773 --> 08:25.876
ELLIE'S NOT IN THE HEDGE
WHERE SHE HIDES FROM THE NANNY.

08:25.876 --> 08:28.508
ELLIE HIDES A LOT.
HEY, ANDY.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.611
(bang)

08:32.743 --> 08:34.715
I GOTTA GO TALK TO HIM.

08:34.715 --> 08:37.718
NO! YOU'RE MY SEARCHING PARTNER/
TELL-ME-ELLIE'S-CRAZY BUDDY.

08:37.718 --> 08:40.250
(cell phone rings)

08:40.250 --> 08:42.152
(ring)
OH.

08:42.152 --> 08:43.754
LET ME GUESS.

08:43.754 --> 08:47.027
YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND SOMEONE
TO TELL YOU THAT I'M CRAZY.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.999
WHEN I FIND YOU,
YOU'RE DEAD.

08:48.999 --> 08:52.002
YOU'LL NEVER FIND ME.
NO ONE WILL.

08:52.002 --> 08:54.164
(clicks teeth)

08:54.164 --> 08:56.266
OH, GREAT!
(beep)

08:56.266 --> 08:58.869
SCOOT OVER, BABY. (grunts)

08:58.869 --> 09:01.612
YOU THINK
JULES WILL EVER LIKE ME?

09:01.612 --> 09:05.145
WHAT DOES GRAYSON HAVE
THAT I DON'T?
I DON'T KNOW. A CHIN?

09:05.145 --> 09:07.878
YEAH, RIGHT.RIGHT.

09:09.780 --> 09:10.921
I'M DONE.

09:10.921 --> 09:12.923
OH, GOOD, SOYOUCAN BE

09:12.923 --> 09:15.886
MY SEARCHING PARTNER/
TELL-ME-ELLIE'S-CRAZY BUDDY.

09:15.886 --> 09:16.887
LET'S GO.

09:16.887 --> 09:18.889
COME ON, HONEY.

09:22.032 --> 09:24.034
YOUR HOUSE IS DUMB.

09:24.034 --> 09:27.037
WELL, AT LEAST YOU DON'T HAVE
A STUPID OCTOPUS PAINTING.

09:27.037 --> 09:28.869
OH, WAIT.

09:28.869 --> 09:31.271
HEY, UH, WE WERE ALL
MAKING FUN OF YOU

09:31.271 --> 09:34.745
WHEN WE WERE TOSSING COPPER--
THAT'S A NEW SLANG FOR

09:34.745 --> 09:37.878
PLAYING PENNY CAN, BY THE WAY.
PASS IT ON, BUT, UH,

09:37.878 --> 09:41.151
YOU ONLY FREAKED OUT ON ME.
HOW COME?
YOU GRABBED MY STOMACH.
I HAVE PERSONAL SPACE ISSUES.

09:41.151 --> 09:43.283
I FREAK OUT
WHEN PEOPLE TOUCH ME.
HMM. OKAY.

09:43.283 --> 09:45.616
HE'S ALSO ALLERGIC
TO RASPBERRIES.

09:45.616 --> 09:46.757
(blows raspberry)

09:46.757 --> 09:50.160
(laughs) THAT TICKLES.

09:50.160 --> 09:52.292
THAT'S DIFFERENT.
HE'S EARNED IT.

09:52.292 --> 09:54.294
HMM. WE ALREADY
CHECKED IN HERE.

09:54.294 --> 09:57.327
YEAH,
WE'LL JUST DOUBLE-CHECK.

09:57.327 --> 09:59.199
WHY ARE WE DOUBLE-CHECKING?

10:01.802 --> 10:05.035
STEAK AND CHAMPAGNE.

10:05.035 --> 10:07.037
I LOVE ME
SOME BEEF AND BUBBLES.

10:07.037 --> 10:10.310
OOH! THAT SHOULD BE
OUR DETECTIVE NAMES.

10:10.310 --> 10:13.644
HE'S BEEF, A GRIZZLED EX-MARINE
WITH A SECRET.

10:13.644 --> 10:15.045
HE'S A VEGETARIAN.

10:15.045 --> 10:17.648
SHE'S BUBBLES,
HIS PLUCKY, HOT PARTNER

10:17.648 --> 10:19.650
WITH A SECRET OF HER OWN.

10:19.650 --> 10:21.291
SHE'S BEEF'S DAUGHTER.

10:21.291 --> 10:23.293
TOGETHER, THEY FIGHT CRIME,

10:23.293 --> 10:24.895
AND EACH WEEK...

10:24.895 --> 10:27.758
MAYBE THEY GROW
A LITTLE BIT CLOSER TOGETHER.

10:27.758 --> 10:32.032
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I GOT CHOKED UP.

10:32.032 --> 10:34.905
(sighs) WELL, WE MIGHT
AS WELL WATCH

10:34.905 --> 10:37.637
THIS FAKE, BORING SUPERMAN
DOCUMENTARY.

10:37.637 --> 10:40.340
SO BEEF, WHY ARE YOU HIDING
YOUR GIRLFRIEND FROM EVERYONE?

10:40.340 --> 10:44.174
GET OUT OF MY GRILL, BUBBLES.

10:44.174 --> 10:46.176
WELL, MRS. TORRES
WASN'T IN THE PANTRY,

10:46.176 --> 10:48.949
BUT THIS NOTE WAS.
"ENOUGH WITH THE COOKIES."

10:48.949 --> 10:51.351
SHE LEAVES NOTES FOR ANDY
EVERYWHERE.

10:51.351 --> 10:54.184
OH.
"KISSING IS FOR SHAVERS."

10:54.184 --> 10:56.656
I MEAN, SHE CALLSME
THE CONTROL FREAK.

10:56.656 --> 11:00.330
DOES THAT MAKES SENSE?
VERY SMOOTH, TRYING TO SLIDE
INTO THAT CONVERSATION.

11:00.330 --> 11:03.063
UNFORTUNATELY, THIS ISN'T
MY FIRST MOTHER-SON RODEO.

11:03.063 --> 11:05.966
OH, I REALLY WISH
THEY HAD THOSE.

11:05.966 --> 11:09.099
I'M ALWAYS THERE FOR YOU
WHEN YOU WANNA TALK. COME ON.

11:09.099 --> 11:12.072
A HEART-TO-HEART
ON MR. AND MRS. TORRES' BED?

11:12.072 --> 11:14.344
YOU WANNA SNUGGLE?

11:14.344 --> 11:16.777
OH, YEAH.
(high-pitched, singsong voice)
KIDDING.

11:16.777 --> 11:18.448
WELL, DON'T TEASE.

11:18.448 --> 11:21.311
ALL RIGHT, ELLIE SEES ME
AS THE DICTATOR WITH EVERYONE.

11:21.311 --> 11:23.313
NOW YOU HAVE
AN OUTSIDE PERSPECTIVE

11:23.313 --> 11:25.315
OF THE CUL-DE-SAC CREW.

11:25.315 --> 11:27.317
HOW DO YOU SEE US?

11:27.317 --> 11:29.960
WELL, I SEE YOU GUYS
AS A BUNCH OF OLD PEOPLE

11:29.960 --> 11:31.962
WITH SURPRISINGLY GOOD SKIN
GIVEN THE AMOUNT

11:31.962 --> 11:33.964
OF WINE AND SUN YOU TAKE IN.

11:33.964 --> 11:36.196
YEAH, I THINK THE ALCOHOL
PRESERVES US.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.198
MOM, I WISH I COULD HELP YOU,

11:38.198 --> 11:41.201
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO QUESTIONS
ABOUT WHO YOU REALLY ARE,

11:41.201 --> 11:45.705
I THINK... THE ONLY PERSON
WHO CAN ANSWER THEM IS YOU.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.810
THAT'S THE DUMBEST THING
I EVER HEARD.

11:49.810 --> 11:51.211
YOU'RE WELCOME.
(drawer opens)

11:51.211 --> 11:53.814
I REALLY DOUBT ELLIE'S
HIDING IN THE DRAWER.

11:53.814 --> 11:55.816
NO, BUT HER...

11:55.816 --> 11:59.089
SEX CHOPSTICKS ARE,
WHATEVER THE HELL THESE DO.

11:59.089 --> 12:01.351
COME ON.
THEY'RE ALL SNOOPING, TOO.

12:01.351 --> 12:03.223
I'M PRETTY SURE THEY'RE NOT.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.825
(chuckles) HEY, LOOK.

12:04.825 --> 12:07.357
TRAVIS' IRONIC T-SHIRT
COLLECTION.

12:07.357 --> 12:10.931
(imitating Travis)
HEY. I'M MOODY AND SARCASTIC.

12:10.931 --> 12:13.063
AH.
AND I'M HOME FOR
THE TENTH STRAIGHT WEEKEND

12:13.063 --> 12:16.206
BECAUSE I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW COLLEGE WORKS.
OH, I DON'T HAVE
A TRAVIS IMPRESSION.

12:16.206 --> 12:18.208
I JUST WANT THIS HOODIE.

12:18.208 --> 12:20.811
HEY, LISTEN, UM,
WE STILL NEED TO TALK.

12:20.811 --> 12:23.213
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT REALLY GOOD
AT BEING REAL

12:23.213 --> 12:25.345
UNLESS I'M TRYING
TO GET SOMEONE'S PANTS OFF.

12:25.345 --> 12:28.348
DON'T KNOW WHERE
THIS IS HEADED, BUT GO ON.

12:30.080 --> 12:32.352
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

12:32.352 --> 12:34.354
YOU DON'T HAVE ISSUES
WITH TOUCHING.

12:34.354 --> 12:36.957
IT'S YOUR FAULT FOR MAKING
YOUR HANDS SMELL SO GOOD.

12:36.957 --> 12:39.830
WHY DO YOU HAVE THIS BIG CHIP
ON YOUR SHOULDER WITH ME, HUH?

12:39.830 --> 12:41.091
I MEAN, DID I DO SOMETHING
TO OFFEND YOU?

12:41.091 --> 12:44.494
BECAUSE IF I DID,
LET'S TALK ABOUT IT, OKAY?

12:44.494 --> 12:47.497
BUT JUST DON'T WALK AWAY AGAIN
BECAUSE IT DRIVES ME...

12:47.497 --> 12:49.499
HMM. I WILL WEAR HIS SKIN.

12:51.842 --> 12:54.504
WOULD YOU STOP WALKING AWAY
FROM ME? IT'S RUDE.

12:54.504 --> 12:58.108
OH, GROW A PAIR, CINDY.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ABOUT IT?

12:58.108 --> 13:00.110
(grunts) HEY.

13:00.110 --> 13:02.252
THAT'SWHAT I'M GONNA DO.

13:02.252 --> 13:03.984
OKAY, HA HA.

13:03.984 --> 13:06.356
ARE YOU STILL THERE?!
(dogs barking in distance)

13:06.356 --> 13:11.391
COME ON! I'M BREATHING
MY OWN BREATH! (grunting)

13:11.391 --> 13:12.993
(TV playing indistinctly,
click)

13:12.993 --> 13:16.226
UGH. I'M SORRY. I CAN'T WATCH
THIS DOCUMENTARY ANYMORE.

13:16.226 --> 13:18.829
YOU KNOW WHAT'S SCARIER
THAN LEX LUTHOR?

13:18.829 --> 13:20.831
THE DECAYING
PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM

13:20.831 --> 13:23.103
THAT'S CHEATING OUR YOUNG PEOPLE
OUT OF A FUTURE.

13:23.103 --> 13:25.105
YOU KNOW WHAT'S
ALSO DECAYING?

13:25.105 --> 13:27.107
THAT ONE
VICE PRINCIPAL'S TEETH.

13:27.107 --> 13:30.010
WHAT DOES SHE
BRUSH THEM WITH, PUDDING?

13:30.010 --> 13:33.513
YOU SEE? THAT'S WHY I DON'T
BRING SAM AROUND YOU GUYS.

13:33.513 --> 13:35.986
OH, NO. HONEY,
DOES SHE HAVE PUDDING TEETH?

13:35.986 --> 13:39.119
NO! 'CAUSE OUR GROUP
IS TOO JUDGMENTAL.

13:39.119 --> 13:41.992
I MEAN, YOU SAW HOW WE TORE
SMITH A NEW TAILPIPE TODAY.

13:41.992 --> 13:43.994
THAT WAS DIFFERENT.
SMITH DUMPED ME,

13:43.994 --> 13:45.996
AND THAT'S THE ONLY REASON

13:45.996 --> 13:48.298
WHY PEOPLE WERE
TALKING CRAP ABOUT HIM.

13:48.298 --> 13:51.301
MM, NO, WE TALKED CRAP ABOUT HIM
WHEN YOU WERE DATING, TOO.

13:51.301 --> 13:53.533
WE JUST DID IT
BEHIND YOUR BACK.

13:53.533 --> 13:55.135
HMM.

13:55.135 --> 13:57.107
SHOULD WE GO CHECK
THE GARAGE?

13:57.107 --> 14:00.110
AH, THE HELL WITH LOOKING.
I WANNA TALK MORE ABOUT ELLIE.

14:00.110 --> 14:02.242
LET'S GO, TALK-BUDDY.

14:02.242 --> 14:04.244
(both mouth words)

14:04.244 --> 14:06.546
(speaks indistinctly)
(thud)

14:06.546 --> 14:10.250
ELLIE AND I HAVE ALWAYS HAD
A COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIP.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.252
WE ACTUALLY MET
AT A SAMPLE SALE.

14:12.252 --> 14:14.384
SHE TRAMPLED ME.

14:14.384 --> 14:17.127
TRAV?TRAV?

14:17.127 --> 14:19.129
(cell phone rings)
HMM.

14:19.129 --> 14:21.131
(beep)
HELLO?

14:21.131 --> 14:22.993
I'VE GOT YOUR BOY.

14:22.993 --> 14:25.395
I'M HAVING THE BEST TIME.
ME, TOO, TOM.

14:25.395 --> 14:27.267
GIVE ME BACK MY SON!

14:27.267 --> 14:29.269
(voice breaks)
MOM, I'M SCARED.

14:29.269 --> 14:32.002
NOW YOU KNOW HE'S OKAY.
GOOD-BYE, JULES.

14:32.002 --> 14:33.573
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

14:33.573 --> 14:37.147
WHAT ARE THOSE CHOPSTICKS FOR?
(beep)

14:49.419 --> 14:52.422
(lowered voice) GET IN QUICK.
JULES WILL SEE YOU.

14:55.265 --> 14:56.666
(lowered voice) OH, MAN.

14:56.666 --> 14:58.428
PIPE DOWN, PRETTY BOY.

14:58.428 --> 15:01.431
HEY, GUYS!
ANYBODY WANT A WINE BREAK?

15:01.431 --> 15:03.673
DON'T MOVE!
IT'S A TRICK.

15:03.673 --> 15:06.406
(sighs) DAMN IT.

15:07.537 --> 15:09.539
HELP ME OUT WITH SOMETHING.

15:09.539 --> 15:12.142
I ALWAYS FELT THIS LITTLE EDGE
FROM ANDY.

15:12.142 --> 15:15.445
WHAT'S HIS PROBLEM WITH ME?
CAN YOU IMAGINE
WHAT IT'S LIKE BEING ANDY?

15:15.445 --> 15:19.549
WELL, HE'S MARRIED TO YOU,
SO I KNOW IT'S MOSTLYTERRIBLE.

15:19.549 --> 15:22.692
ZING. GIVE ME SOME, TRAV.
(chuckles) NO, THANKS.

15:22.692 --> 15:25.695
LOOK, WHEN ANDY'S PARENTS
FIRST MOVED HERE FROM CUBA,

15:25.695 --> 15:29.559
THEY SCRAPED UP ENOUGH MONEY
TO SEND HIM TO PREP SCHOOL.

15:29.559 --> 15:31.561
SO IN WALKS THIS
HUSKY, BALDING, 11-YEAR-OLD

15:31.561 --> 15:33.563
WITH A WHOLE FRIED FISH
FOR LUNCH.

15:33.563 --> 15:36.166
HE GOT TERRORIZED
BY PRETTY BOY D-BAGS LIKE YOU

15:36.166 --> 15:38.308
NAMED WYATT OR DECKLAND.

15:38.308 --> 15:41.441
AND EVERY TIME YOU TEASE HIM,
YOU REMIND HIM OF THOSE GUYS.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.713
DON'T FEED INTO IT,
AND YOU'LL BE FINE.

15:43.713 --> 15:45.145
NO PROBLEM...

15:45.145 --> 15:48.148
EXCEPT FOR I JUST TIED HIM
TO A TREE. I GOTTA GO GET HIM.

15:48.148 --> 15:50.680
GET PILLOWS AND WINE.

15:50.680 --> 15:55.025
AND IF YOU TELL JULES
THAT WE'RE HERE, I WILL END YOU.
CAN YOU GET MY RETAINER?

16:00.430 --> 16:02.032
THIS SUCKS. (sighs)

16:02.032 --> 16:04.034
WHY AREN'T YOU AT COLLEGE?

16:04.034 --> 16:08.438
YOU KNOW, TOM,
I DON'T...KNOW.

16:10.070 --> 16:14.174
YOU KNOW WHAT, BEEF?
I'VE DECIDED I'M MAD AT YOU.

16:14.174 --> 16:17.307
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY FAITH
IN YOUR FRIENDS.

16:17.307 --> 16:19.449
WE WOULD NEVER TRASH SAM.

16:19.449 --> 16:21.451
WHEN I WAS DATING SMITH,

16:21.451 --> 16:24.184
I KNEW THAT HE WASN'T
EVERYONE'S FAVORITE.

16:24.184 --> 16:27.317
BUT YOU GUYS NEVER SAID
ANY OF THAT STUFF TO MY FACE,

16:27.317 --> 16:30.460
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW
WE SUPPORT EACH OTHER.

16:30.460 --> 16:32.462
IT'S KIND OF BEAUTIFUL.
I MEAN,

16:32.462 --> 16:35.595
NO ONE LIKES ELLIE, BUT WE'RE
NOT MEAN WHEN ANDY'S AROUND.

16:35.595 --> 16:39.429
I LIKE ELLIE.
(chuckles) COME ON, BUDDY.
IT'S JUST US.

16:39.429 --> 16:43.033
EVERYONE IS GONNA BE SO PSYCHED
THAT YOU'RE DATING AGAIN,

16:43.033 --> 16:47.177
THAT WE'LL BE COOL,
EVEN IF SAM TOTALLY SUCKS.

16:47.177 --> 16:49.579
BOBBY,
WE'RE THE CUL-DE-SAC CREW.

16:49.579 --> 16:51.741
WE ALWAYS HAVE
EACH OTHER'S BACKS.

16:51.741 --> 16:53.313
(door opens)

16:53.313 --> 16:56.316
PUT MY ICE CREAM AWAY
AND GO GET SOME WINE AND PILLOWS

16:56.316 --> 16:58.318
AND GO HIDE FROM JULES
IN THE TRUCK.

16:58.318 --> 17:01.321
I GOTTA GO GET ANDY
BECAUSE I TIED HIM TO A TREE.

17:01.321 --> 17:05.455
OUR GROUP IS SO MUCH FUN!
(door closes)

17:05.455 --> 17:06.726
(footsteps approach)

17:06.726 --> 17:08.728
(muffled voice)
IS SOMEONE THERE?

17:08.728 --> 17:10.730
PLEASE HELP. DO THE RIGHT THING.

17:10.730 --> 17:12.732
ANDY? WHAT HAPPENED?

17:12.732 --> 17:15.605
YOUR BOYFRIEND'S A BIG BULLY.
UNTIE ME.

17:15.605 --> 17:17.607
OH, MY GOODNESS.

17:17.607 --> 17:19.609
OH.

17:19.609 --> 17:21.611
WOW. I'LL HAVE
TO GET SOME SCISSORS.

17:21.611 --> 17:24.214
HEY, YOU KNOW, I'M HAVING
A BAD DAY, TOO.

17:24.214 --> 17:27.217
HEY, DO YOU THINK THERE'S
ANYTHING TO WHAT ELLIE SAID?

17:27.217 --> 17:30.220
I MEAN, THE WAY I SEE IT--
I AM SO HOT!

17:30.220 --> 17:33.583
FINE! KEEP YOUR SHIRT ON.
(chuckles) GET IT?

17:33.583 --> 17:35.585
I'M GOING.

17:36.726 --> 17:39.329
OKAY, SHE'S GONE.
I'LL UNTIE YOU.

17:39.329 --> 17:41.060
I CAN STILL KICK.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.062
DO YOU WANNA BE LET GO
OR NOT?

17:43.062 --> 17:46.466
OKAY, SO I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T
HAVE TIED YOU TO A TREE.

17:46.466 --> 17:49.739
SINCE I'M CUBAN,
IT'S ALMOST A HATE CRIME.

17:49.739 --> 17:53.072
LOOK, DON'T COMPARE ME
TO THOSE DOUCHEY GUYS

17:53.072 --> 17:55.074
THAT HASSLED YOU
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.476
ELLIE TOLD YOU? PERFECT.

17:56.476 --> 17:58.478
YOU KNOW WHY
YOU'RE AN IDIOT?

17:58.478 --> 18:00.480
ONE OF THE REASONS,
ANYWAY?

18:00.480 --> 18:02.482
IT'S 'CAUSE
YOU'RE STILL COMPETING

18:02.482 --> 18:05.084
WITH A BUNCH OF JERKS
FROM YOUR PAST.

18:05.084 --> 18:08.658
BUT, DUDE, YOU ALREADY WON.
I MEAN, YOU GOT A HOT WIFE

18:08.658 --> 18:10.660
AND A BEAUTIFUL SON
AND A GREAT JOB.

18:10.660 --> 18:14.093
MOST OF THOSE COOL GUYS--
I BET THEY'RE LIKE ME--

18:14.093 --> 18:16.766
YOU KNOW, DIVORCED,
STRUGGLING THROUGH LIFE,

18:16.766 --> 18:18.628
PEAKED AT 18.

18:18.628 --> 18:21.100
WOW. YOU'RE A TOTAL LOSER.

18:21.100 --> 18:24.103
WHAT? NO, I GOT, UH,
I GOT JULES NOW.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.276
(chuckles) YEAH,
BUT YOU'RE GONNA BLOW THAT.

18:26.276 --> 18:27.737
I--FORGET IT.

18:27.737 --> 18:28.878
WAIT.

18:30.340 --> 18:33.213
THANKS FOR COMING BACK
FOR ME.

18:34.484 --> 18:37.217
ANDY?
ALL RIGHT, DON'T PISS ME OFF.

18:37.217 --> 18:39.489
I'VE GOT SCISSORS!

18:39.489 --> 18:40.750
ANDY?! ANDY!

18:40.750 --> 18:43.623
(Johnny Flynn's "Tickle Me Pink"
playing)

18:43.623 --> 18:46.226
WAIT.WHEREARE YOU?

18:46.226 --> 18:48.228
(lowered voice)
OOH. HEY, OVER HERE!

18:48.228 --> 18:50.360
OH, GOOD YOU INVITED HER.

18:50.360 --> 18:53.763
OH. HI.

18:53.763 --> 18:55.365
HEY.

18:57.237 --> 18:59.909
EVERYONE, THIS IS SAM...

18:59.909 --> 19:01.241
MY GIRLFRIEND.

19:01.241 --> 19:02.812
OHH!

19:02.812 --> 19:05.375

19:05.375 --> 19:08.278
OKAY, GUYS, I'M THE LAST ONE!

19:08.278 --> 19:11.251
GAME OVER!
YOU CAN ALL COME OUT NOW!

19:11.251 --> 19:14.254
NOBODY MOVE.
SHE'S ABOUT TO SNAP.

19:14.254 --> 19:17.527
I SWEAR TO GOD, I WILL BURN
THIS WHOLE CUL-DE-SAC DOWN!

19:17.527 --> 19:19.529
(dogs barking in distance)

19:19.529 --> 19:22.492
HEY, MS. VASQUEZ.
JUST PLAYING A LITTLE GAME.

19:22.492 --> 19:24.764

19:24.764 --> 19:28.238

19:28.238 --> 19:30.640
SHE NEEDS ME.
NO! HOLD HIM DOWN.

19:30.640 --> 19:32.642
SAM, COVER HIS MOUTH!
I DON'T LIKE THIS.

19:32.642 --> 19:35.405
JUST DO IT, SAM!

19:35.405 --> 19:39.249
IT IS DARK,
AND I AM TIRED OF BEING ALONE!

19:39.249 --> 19:41.651
ELLIE?
в™Є I WISH I WAS HOME
AND TUCKED AWAY в™Є

19:41.651 --> 19:44.284
ELLIE! FRIEND TEST!

19:44.284 --> 19:46.286
в™Є WHEN NOTHING GOES RIGHT,
AND THE FUTURE'S DARK в™Є

19:46.286 --> 19:49.689
(Travis)
UGH, CAN WE STAND UP, TOO?

19:49.689 --> 19:52.792
OKAY, EVERYONE,
FRIEND TEST!

19:52.792 --> 19:55.795
OH, THANK GOD! THAT WAS
LIKE A BUTT NUMB-A-THON.

19:55.795 --> 19:57.667
OH!

19:57.667 --> 19:59.669
LOOK, THIS WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE FUN.

19:59.669 --> 20:02.802
BUT, ELLIE, YOU WERE RIGHT.
I-I AM AN EVIL DICTATOR.

20:02.802 --> 20:05.705
EVEN WHEN I WAS A KID, I USED TO
ORDER MY FRIENDS AROUND SO MUCH,

20:05.705 --> 20:07.707
THEY CALLED ME "BOSSY BOY."

20:07.707 --> 20:09.309
BOSSYBOY?

20:09.309 --> 20:11.681
OH. I DIDN'T GET BOOBS
UNTIL I WAS A SENIOR.

20:11.681 --> 20:13.283
LATE BLOOMER. NICE!

20:13.283 --> 20:14.684
NO, TOM.

20:14.684 --> 20:17.647
I DON'T KNOW WHY EVERYTHING
ALWAYS HAS TO BE MY WAY.

20:17.647 --> 20:19.249
I DON'T. I JUST...

20:19.249 --> 20:22.252
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW YOU GUYS PUT UP WITH ME.

20:22.252 --> 20:23.653
I'M--I'M SO SORRY.

20:23.653 --> 20:25.525
OH, PLEASE.
I WAS JUST PISSY

20:25.525 --> 20:27.527
'CAUSE YOU WOULDN'T
GO OFF-ROADING.

20:27.527 --> 20:29.429
(Ellie) WE'RE ALL GROWNUPS.

20:29.429 --> 20:31.831
WE WOULDN'T SPEND EVERY SECOND
AT YOUR HOUSE

20:31.831 --> 20:35.265
IF WE DIDN'T WANT TO.
I HAD A BLAST TODAY.

20:35.265 --> 20:37.267
I ATE STEAK!
BEST NIGHT EVER.

20:37.267 --> 20:40.310
(Bobby) IT WAS ALL RIGHT.
JULES, IF WE HAD TO ELECT
A GROUP LEADER, IT'D BE YOU.

20:40.310 --> 20:42.312
YOU BRING US ALL TOGETHER.

20:42.312 --> 20:43.543
THANK YOU.

20:43.543 --> 20:45.445
WHO'S THE NEW CHICK?

20:45.445 --> 20:47.277
OH, IT'S MY GIRLFRIEND SAM.

20:47.277 --> 20:50.420
WELL, WELCOME, SAM.
GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT.

20:50.420 --> 20:53.423
WANT TO PLAY ANOTHER ROUND?
HEY, TOM, YOU WANNA HIDE?

20:53.423 --> 20:54.824
I'M A GREAT HIDER.

20:54.824 --> 20:56.956
в™Є PUSHED BACK
THROUGH THE LEAFY GROUND в™Є

20:56.956 --> 20:58.958
в™Є PRAY FOR THE PEOPLE
INSIDE YOUR HEAD в™Є

20:58.958 --> 21:01.291
WANNA HEAD INSIDE
AND DRINK SOME WINE?

21:01.291 --> 21:02.432
YEAH.
HELL, YEAH.

21:02.432 --> 21:03.563
(Bobby) OHH.

21:03.563 --> 21:06.566
в™Є WHEN YOU'RE DEAD,
WHEN YOU'RE... в™Є

21:12.942 --> 21:16.806
(sighs) SO... DID Y'ALL BAG
ON SAM ONCE WE LEFT?

21:16.806 --> 21:18.808
WHAT COULD WE POSSIBLY
SAY ABOUT HER?

21:18.808 --> 21:22.582
WE MET HER FOR, LIKE,
TWO SECONDS.
WELL,
THAT'S ALL YOU'RE GONNA GET,

21:22.582 --> 21:24.684
BECAUSE SHE DUMPED ME.
GO AHEAD.

21:24.684 --> 21:27.687
BAD HAIR, WEIRD NOSE,
THICK NECK.
SHE SHOOK MY HAND
WITH HER FINGERTIPS.

21:27.687 --> 21:32.322
WHAT ARE YOU,
THE QUEEN OF FRANCE?
HER FACE MADE ME WANT TO LEARN
HOW TO BOX.

21:32.322 --> 21:34.724
MAN,THERE'S A LOT OF LOVE
IN THIS ROOM.

21:34.724 --> 21:35.825
AW.

21:35.825 --> 21:37.427
SORRY.
