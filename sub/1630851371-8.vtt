Nick:
<i> As tv's number one show,</i>

00:03.921 --> 00:06.380
<i> we've got a lot</i>
<i> to be thankful for...</i>

00:06.382 --> 00:09.341
- That's amazing!
-<i> Because so far,</i>

00:09.343 --> 00:12.928
<i> season six has been</i>
<i> serving up a feast of fun.</i>

00:12.972 --> 00:14.930
( trills, laughs )

00:14.974 --> 00:17.224
- dwight howard!
- <i> And a full cornucopia</i>

00:17.268 --> 00:20.436
<i> of the biggest stars</i>
<i> that have ever been unmasked.</i>

00:20.438 --> 00:22.438
Larry the cable guy!

00:22.440 --> 00:24.648
Toni braxton!

00:24.692 --> 00:27.609
My man rob schneider!

00:27.653 --> 00:31.155
- Oh, my gosh.
- Wow.

00:32.366 --> 00:35.159
Welcome to the masky's
thanksgiving parade.

00:38.998 --> 00:40.831
It's officially November,

00:40.875 --> 00:42.499
and we're ready
to start giving thanks.

00:49.175 --> 00:51.842
<i> Group b is here</i>
<i> to serve up a musical buffet</i>

00:51.844 --> 00:54.970
- <i> of epic proportions. </i>
- Wow!

00:55.014 --> 00:56.388
- They're gonna win it all.
- ( gobbling )

00:56.432 --> 01:00.100
<i> along with the last wild card</i>
<i> of the season.</i>

01:00.102 --> 01:01.226
How many do you think
there's in there?

01:01.270 --> 01:03.145
<i> But save some room</i>
<i> for dessert.</i>

01:03.189 --> 01:04.438
- Push it! Push it!
- I wouldn't do it!

01:04.482 --> 01:07.232
<i> Because someone</i>
<i> is getting stuffed.</i>

01:07.276 --> 01:09.943
- Oh, my god!
- Oh, no!

01:09.987 --> 01:13.781
<i> So get ready</i>
<i> for an early-bird special,</i>

01:13.824 --> 01:17.201
<i> because even though</i>
<i> it's technically</i>
<i> not thanksgiving yet...</i>

01:17.244 --> 01:21.121
It doesn't matter on
"the masked singer."

01:21.165 --> 01:25.250
<i> ( music playing )</i>

01:25.294 --> 01:29.213
-<i> ♪ I want to thank you  </i>
- wow, look at that.

01:29.256 --> 01:31.548
<i> ♪ be myself again </i>

01:34.970 --> 01:37.846
<i> ♪ thank you for letting me </i>

01:37.848 --> 01:40.474
-<i> ♪ be myself again  </i>
- yeah!

01:40.518 --> 01:41.934
Nicole: Wow.

01:41.977 --> 01:45.854
Welcome to
"the masked singer."

01:45.898 --> 01:48.816
yeah!

01:48.859 --> 01:51.819
Tonight, our remaining group b
singers are giving thanks

01:51.862 --> 01:53.320
for making it this far
in the competition

01:53.364 --> 01:56.990
and fighting for a spot
in the semi-finals.

01:57.034 --> 01:59.827
But the last wild card
of the season

01:59.829 --> 02:02.663
is showing up uninvited
to the feast,

02:02.706 --> 02:05.040
and there's not enough turkey
to go around.

02:05.084 --> 02:07.167
The suspense!

02:07.211 --> 02:12.422
Now let's give it up
for our favorite tv detectives,

02:12.466 --> 02:15.092
nicole scherzinger,

02:15.177 --> 02:17.386
jenny mccarthy wahlberg,

02:17.429 --> 02:18.929
robin thicke,

02:18.973 --> 02:21.056
and dr. Ken jeong.

02:21.100 --> 02:22.850
And who is our guest panelist?

02:22.852 --> 02:24.601
One of the biggest stars
in the world.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.145
And I'm talking about height.

02:26.230 --> 02:29.022
- Y'all make some noise
for joel mchale!
- Ken: That's right.

02:29.066 --> 02:31.108
Jenny: Yes!

02:32.444 --> 02:36.321
- Nicole: Oh, my god.
- What?

02:36.365 --> 02:38.907
- Nick: What is going on?
- Jenny: What's he doing?

02:38.951 --> 02:40.617
- Ken: Why's he eating turkey?
- ( gobbling )

02:40.661 --> 02:44.955
is he eating a turkey leg?
What is this? Medieval times?

02:44.999 --> 02:47.457
Hi, nick. Wanna bite?

02:47.501 --> 02:49.126
I'm vegan.

02:49.170 --> 02:51.420
Happy thanksgiving,
everybody!

02:52.256 --> 02:54.214
- ( gobbling )
- see you later!

02:54.258 --> 02:57.050
Ken:
Look at the turkey right there.

02:57.094 --> 02:58.385
What an entrance.

02:58.429 --> 03:00.762
- Joel mchale,
ladies and gentlemen.
- Thank you.

03:00.806 --> 03:03.932
This is the first time I've ever
seen a ham eat a turkey.

03:03.976 --> 03:05.851
- Ooh.
- Ha-ha!

03:05.853 --> 03:07.644
The puns are already flying.

03:07.646 --> 03:10.898
Ken and joel, you guys
will be ringing in
the new year live on fox.

03:10.941 --> 03:12.357
- Jenny: Yes!
- Yeah!

03:12.735 --> 03:16.028
That's right.
For a second year, I will
carry ken the entire show.

03:16.071 --> 03:18.697
No. How dare you?

03:18.741 --> 03:20.657
I don't know if new york city
is ready for the both
of you, though.

03:20.659 --> 03:23.368
I'm pretty sure
you guys have got a lot
in store for us, right?

03:23.370 --> 03:24.620
- We do.
- Well, nick, do you
wanna come with?

03:24.663 --> 03:27.789
- No.
- Okay, great.

03:27.833 --> 03:30.834
That was really quick, nick.
That was lightning quick.

03:30.836 --> 03:32.044
We'll see them
on new years, y'all.

03:32.087 --> 03:34.046
Make some noise
for them for sure.

03:34.089 --> 03:36.423
- Toast and roast!
- Toast and roast!

03:36.467 --> 03:38.008
Toast and roast.

03:38.052 --> 03:39.927
Now, our panel
has been struggling

03:39.970 --> 03:41.845
with their first impression
guesses so far.

03:41.889 --> 03:43.931
Only ken has a point.

03:43.974 --> 03:45.057
How are we eight episodes in

03:45.100 --> 03:46.975
and only ken has a point?

03:47.019 --> 03:48.852
Thank you, daddy.

03:48.854 --> 03:51.021
Now, I wanna remind you, panel,

03:51.065 --> 03:54.274
that the take it off buzzer
is still in play.

03:54.318 --> 03:58.195
As you know, only one of you
can use it per group.

03:58.197 --> 04:00.781
If you really think you know
who's behind the mask,

04:00.824 --> 04:01.865
boom, you hit it.

04:02.201 --> 04:05.369
If you're right, the singer
must immediately unmask

04:05.412 --> 04:06.620
and get eliminated,

04:06.956 --> 04:10.999
and you get two extra points
towards the golden ear trophy.

04:11.043 --> 04:12.918
- Ken: Two?
- Yes, two. You got it, two.

04:12.962 --> 04:14.294
I feel good.
I feel good about this, nick.

04:14.338 --> 04:16.088
All right, let's get to it.

04:16.131 --> 04:19.508
We're kicking story time off
with mallard.

04:19.551 --> 04:23.387
What's this bird thankful for
other than not being a turkey?

04:23.430 --> 04:25.222
Take a look.

04:28.060 --> 04:31.687
One thing this duck
is thankful for is family.

04:31.730 --> 04:35.315
In fact, I rose to fame
as part of a pretty famous one.

04:35.359 --> 04:38.318
- Allen key. Exactly.
- Like alan jackson.

04:38.362 --> 04:41.113
Mallard:<i> Sometimes family</i>
<i> has its challenges.</i>

04:43.158 --> 04:46.243
<i> I've scrutiny over stuff</i>
<i> my family members said.</i>

04:46.287 --> 04:49.329
- Uh-oh.
- No kidding.

04:49.373 --> 04:51.456
Mallard:<i> But no matter</i>
<i> how much you disagree,</i>

04:51.500 --> 04:54.334
<i> you still gotta get together</i>
<i> at the end of the day</i>

04:54.378 --> 04:56.128
<i> and have a good</i>
<i> ol' supper together,</i>

04:56.171 --> 04:58.922
<i> and always remember</i>
<i> that there's probably</i>

04:58.966 --> 05:00.382
<i> more things about each other</i>

05:00.426 --> 05:03.260
<i> that we are alike</i>
<i> than we are different.</i>

05:03.262 --> 05:06.888
This next song is by someone
I basically consider family,

05:06.932 --> 05:08.265
- luke bryan.
- Yee-haw!

05:08.309 --> 05:10.851
Years ago, he asked me
to get up onstage

05:10.853 --> 05:12.311
and sing this song.

05:12.313 --> 05:15.022
But one problem--
I didn't know the words.

05:15.065 --> 05:16.648
I just couldn't do it.

05:16.650 --> 05:19.943
<i> And I have regretted that</i>
<i> my whole life.</i>

05:19.987 --> 05:22.029
<i> So tonight is redemption.</i>

05:22.072 --> 05:24.573

- Nicole: Quack!

06:55.999 --> 06:58.959
Quack!

06:59.002 --> 07:01.044
Nick: Oh.

07:04.967 --> 07:06.133
Wow.

07:06.135 --> 07:09.052
There it is! Mallard!

07:09.972 --> 07:12.097
Setting it off up in here.

07:12.141 --> 07:14.933
Mallard, you got, like,
moves like jagger.

07:14.977 --> 07:19.479
You own the stage,
and once again, a killer
performance. Great job.

07:19.523 --> 07:22.899
- It's always a good time.
- Always a good time.

07:22.943 --> 07:24.818
- Every time he hits the stage,
it's a great time.
- Ken: Really good.

07:24.862 --> 07:29.156
All right, panel,
it's not thanksgiving
without some turkey.

07:29.199 --> 07:33.034
So tonight, we will be given
some one word clues

07:33.078 --> 07:34.411
by a feathered friend.

07:34.455 --> 07:37.080
- Unleash the turkey drop.
- ( gobbling )

07:37.124 --> 07:38.331
- uh-oh.
- What?

07:38.375 --> 07:41.126
Where's that? Oh!
Behind you, ken.

07:41.170 --> 07:43.420
- Robin: Oh.
- ( gobbling )

07:43.464 --> 07:44.838
nick: Gobble, gobble, gobble.

07:44.882 --> 07:46.965
All right,
dig into turkey, ken.

07:47.000 --> 07:47.841
Break the wishbone.

07:48.135 --> 07:50.594
- The crown is the clue.
- Robin: Oh, crown.

07:50.637 --> 07:53.263
On the turkey is a crown.

07:53.307 --> 07:55.724
It makes me think of,
he's, like, hollywood royalty.

07:55.726 --> 07:59.102
Based off that package,
we know he either grew up
in a famous family

07:59.104 --> 08:01.229
or the family
all kind of became famous,

08:01.231 --> 08:02.731
or someone in the family did.

08:02.774 --> 08:05.066
The person I'm thinking of
does have a famous daughter,

08:05.068 --> 08:10.155
and tonight, I felt like
I heard a little bit
of this guy's voice.

08:10.199 --> 08:13.825
You know, I hate
to ever agree with ken,

08:13.827 --> 08:16.578
but I think it might be
billy ray cyrus.

08:16.580 --> 08:17.996
- Robin: Oh.
- Ken: Oh.

08:18.040 --> 08:19.581
Nick: That's not
a bad guess, jenny.

08:19.583 --> 08:20.957
Very good guess, jenny.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.626
All right, well, robin,
what you picking up on?

08:22.669 --> 08:26.421
Well, you know, I'm thinking
about this famous family thing

08:26.465 --> 08:28.507
that jenny's
also picking up on,

08:28.550 --> 08:31.051
and there's
a very famous actor

08:31.094 --> 08:33.220
who also has
a country rock band

08:33.263 --> 08:35.388
and has a very famous father
who's also an actor,

08:35.390 --> 08:37.724
and I'm thinking it might be
somebody like kiefer sutherland.

08:37.768 --> 08:41.102
- Jenny: Huh!
- Nicole:
Oh, that's good, robin.

08:41.104 --> 08:42.771
So I'm gonna go off of that.

08:42.814 --> 08:45.982
When I think of a royal family
or a famous family,

08:46.026 --> 08:48.860
I think of my dear friends
the osbournes, right?

08:48.862 --> 08:52.030
I think it would be so much fun
if that was jack osbourne.

08:52.074 --> 08:54.199
- Robin: Oh.
- Ken: Oh.

08:54.243 --> 08:57.369
Nicole: But it could be
a country singer still.

08:57.412 --> 08:59.162
I've been going off
the country singer vibes.

08:59.164 --> 09:00.288
Yeah.

09:00.332 --> 09:02.999
And how do I like my men?
Big and rich.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.835
That's right.
So I think this could be--

09:05.837 --> 09:07.754
you don't like them
short and poor? I thought--

09:07.798 --> 09:11.132
I think this could be
john rich from big & rich.

09:11.134 --> 09:12.092
- Ken: Oh!
- Robin: Okay. Okay.

09:12.094 --> 09:13.468
Jenny: That's not bad.

09:13.470 --> 09:16.221
But nicole, didn't he sing
a big & rich song

09:16.265 --> 09:17.722
the first time
we ever saw him?

09:17.766 --> 09:19.266
The really considerate one

09:19.268 --> 09:21.017
about saving a horse
and riding a cowboy.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.352
Jenny: Yes, exactly.

09:22.396 --> 09:23.853
It's a considerate
country song.

09:23.855 --> 09:25.272
It's an environmentalist theme.

09:25.307 --> 09:26.898
Nicole: He could be
throwing us off.

09:26.942 --> 09:28.233
I mean, we could just stop
all the guessing,

09:28.235 --> 09:30.110
and he could just tell us
who he is.

09:30.153 --> 09:31.361
That would ruin the show, joel.

09:32.489 --> 09:34.906
Go ahead and make some noise
one more time

09:34.950 --> 09:38.118
for my man mallard.
Such a great job.

09:38.161 --> 09:41.454
Now go ahead
and waddle backstage, sir.

09:44.668 --> 09:46.209
Hey, uh, mallard.

09:46.253 --> 09:47.210
Chris pratt here.

09:47.504 --> 09:52.382
Awhile back you and I
went out catching frogs.

09:52.384 --> 09:54.634
Any chance you could send
someone to come pick me up?

09:54.678 --> 09:56.261
I mean...

09:57.848 --> 09:59.139
I've been waiting a while.

10:01.143 --> 10:03.518
A little muddy in this swamp.

10:03.562 --> 10:04.561
Send help, mallard.

10:06.648 --> 10:08.064
<i> ♪ who is that? </i>

10:12.279 --> 10:14.029
Tonight's all about
giving thanks,

10:14.072 --> 10:15.447
and I'm thankful
to sing these songs

10:15.490 --> 10:18.241
<i> in front of real people</i>
<i> making real noise.</i>

10:18.285 --> 10:20.327
Something about that crowd
gets you going.

10:20.370 --> 10:23.038
<i> You know, you feed off that.</i>

10:23.081 --> 10:25.707
It was definitely emotional
hearing the crowd react
to my performance.

11:00.952 --> 11:03.328

<i> an excuse to call them.</i>

11:03.372 --> 11:05.246

- Hello?

11:05.290 --> 11:07.248

- How cute is that costume?
- It's bananas. It's amazing.

13:45.909 --> 13:48.326
I think we got ourselves
a boy bander!

13:48.370 --> 13:53.164
Somebody definitely knows
what they're doing.

13:53.208 --> 13:56.793
This feels like a professional
right here. I don't know.

13:56.795 --> 13:59.921
- Right?
- How did this performance
make you feel, robin?

13:59.965 --> 14:01.089
I love the song choice.

14:01.132 --> 14:03.216
Obviously,
always a good party song.

14:03.260 --> 14:05.134
- And I love the costume--
- I love your jacket. Wow.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.595
- I know. Look at that.
- Thank you.

14:07.597 --> 14:10.056
That's right.

14:10.100 --> 14:14.143
Honestly, it's so hard to
do the moves that you're doing
in that outfit.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.020
That was an epic performance.

14:16.064 --> 14:18.022
Nicole: Come on!

14:18.066 --> 14:20.859
All right, panel,
time for another one word clue

14:20.861 --> 14:23.194
courtesy of our turkey drop.

14:23.238 --> 14:26.447
- Bring it, turkey.
- ( gobbling )

14:26.449 --> 14:27.991
look out, nicole!

14:27.993 --> 14:30.243
Oh, gosh.
Is this happening right now?

14:30.287 --> 14:32.287
Wow. Okay, let's do this.

14:32.330 --> 14:34.122
Oh. "pop."

14:34.165 --> 14:36.165
- all: Oh!
- Oh, pop singer.

14:36.209 --> 14:37.584
That just hit you, ken?

14:37.586 --> 14:40.670
It did, daddy. It did.

14:40.714 --> 14:44.048
Thinking pop star,
you can think, like,
niall horan, harry styles.

14:44.092 --> 14:45.842
But then in that clue package

14:45.844 --> 14:47.260
it was implied
that he's adopted.

14:47.262 --> 14:49.846
Actually, our good friend,
keegan-michael key,

14:49.890 --> 14:52.348
great comedian, I just worked
with him on a mike myers film.

14:52.392 --> 14:53.433
Look it up.

14:53.476 --> 14:55.226
Ken, you just
dropped something, babe.

14:55.270 --> 14:58.730
Yeah, I dropped three names.
Keegan-michael key.

14:58.773 --> 15:02.025
He's adopted,
but I don't know if he has
this kind of voice,

15:02.068 --> 15:05.236
so if there's,
like, a pop star

15:05.238 --> 15:07.906
that's adopted or was
estranged from his family.

15:07.949 --> 15:09.407
( gasps )
oh, oh!

15:09.451 --> 15:11.451
Oh, oh, my god.
Are you okay?

15:11.494 --> 15:12.952
Spider? Spider?

15:12.996 --> 15:14.245
- I know who it is!
- What?

15:14.247 --> 15:16.289
- Where's that button?
- No, no, no, no, no!

15:16.333 --> 15:18.917
- Gimme the button,
gimme the button!
- Don't do it!

15:18.960 --> 15:21.711
No, no, no, no.
No, jenny, jenny--

15:21.755 --> 15:22.921
I need the button!
I need the button!
I need the button!

15:23.256 --> 15:23.796
- She's gonna push the button.
- Caterpillar: What's happening?

15:24.341 --> 15:26.925
- No, no, no! No, no!
- ( humming )

15:26.968 --> 15:28.176
- oh, my god.
- Don't do it. Jenny--

15:28.178 --> 15:29.344
joel: You're not allowed
to touch the button.

15:29.638 --> 15:31.429
- It's hot!
- Are you sure you want
to do this, jenny?

15:31.473 --> 15:35.058
- I know who exactly
who this is, guys.
- Nicole: No, don't--

15:35.101 --> 15:36.601
are you sure you want
to do this, jenny?

15:36.686 --> 15:37.518
Ken: No, no, no, no.

15:37.771 --> 15:39.187
( chanting )
push it, push it, push it!

15:39.230 --> 15:42.065
No, jenny, jenny.
Don't do it. No, no.
Don't do it.

15:42.108 --> 15:44.359
- Push it, push it, push it!
- I wouldn't do it!

15:44.361 --> 15:47.278
I wouldn't do it!
I really wouldn't!

15:49.699 --> 15:50.698
<i> ♪ who is that? </i>

15:53.161 --> 15:57.121
Push it! Push it! Push it!
Push it! Push it!

15:57.165 --> 16:00.750
I know exactly
who this is, guys.

16:00.752 --> 16:03.378
- Don't do it, jenny.
- Are you sure you wanna
do this, jenny?

16:03.421 --> 16:06.005
- It's a big risk.
- Push it! Push it! Push it!

16:06.049 --> 16:08.925
Ken: I wouldn't do it!
I really wouldn't!

16:08.927 --> 16:10.218
- ( screams )
- robin: Oh.

16:11.721 --> 16:13.179
Okay. I'm putting this away.

16:13.264 --> 16:14.389
- Thanks for the false alarm.
- Ken: Yeah, put it away, robin.

16:14.808 --> 16:16.182
- Nicole: Put it away, robin!
- Way to get me all excited.

16:16.226 --> 16:17.850
- Put it away.
- Joel: Yeah.

16:17.852 --> 16:19.394
This will be
a good learning experience,

16:19.396 --> 16:21.980
so if you love my guess,
then I can feel

16:21.982 --> 16:23.439
horrible afterwards
like I should've pressed it.

16:23.483 --> 16:25.817
But if you hate my guess,
then it's a good thing.

16:25.860 --> 16:27.443
So here we go.

16:27.445 --> 16:30.530
Adopted, boy bander,

16:30.573 --> 16:32.240
the word "pop" was a clue.

16:32.242 --> 16:34.951
He sings "dirty pop" in n'sync.

16:34.995 --> 16:38.413
Jc chasez, people! Adopted!

16:38.456 --> 16:40.832
Nicole: I'm so glad
that you did not press it.

16:40.834 --> 16:43.001
- Why?
- That is not jc.

16:43.044 --> 16:45.378
Wasn't that just an n'sync song
that he sung?

16:45.380 --> 16:48.256
It doesn't matter
on "the masked singer."

16:48.299 --> 16:49.415
- robin: That's true.
- Really?

16:49.417 --> 16:51.426
- No.
- But you know what?

16:51.469 --> 16:53.052
It could be also be,
by the way,

16:53.096 --> 16:54.554
someone that has
been here before.

16:54.597 --> 16:57.640
- Right, right.
- Like, a joey fatone even.

16:57.684 --> 17:00.018
There's no rules to say
no one can come back twice.

17:00.061 --> 17:01.519
- That's right.
- That's right.

17:01.563 --> 17:02.603
You never know!

17:02.939 --> 17:05.064
Nick: Robin thicke, make
some sense out of this, man.

17:05.066 --> 17:09.986
After all that excitement,
well, in the clue package
there was a beanbag.

17:10.030 --> 17:11.446
- Bb.
- Jenny: Yep.

17:11.489 --> 17:12.530
I'm getting the boy band.
I'm getting the backstreet.

17:12.824 --> 17:15.742
I'm still not off
of the aj mclean train though.

17:15.785 --> 17:16.951
Jenny: Yes.

17:17.328 --> 17:20.455
But what you do
about that big thing, robin,
called adopted?

17:20.498 --> 17:23.583
That clue package didn't
necessarily say he was adopted.

17:23.585 --> 17:25.084
See, that's what I-- yeah.

17:25.128 --> 17:28.004
It said he was adopted.

17:28.048 --> 17:29.380
No, it didn't.
Where did it say that?

17:29.424 --> 17:33.342
It said, "nick cannon,
your boy was adopted."

17:33.386 --> 17:35.303
that's what it said
in the clue package.

17:35.346 --> 17:37.221
I have a memory
like an elephant.

17:37.265 --> 17:39.932
If he's not adopted, maybe
he was coming out to his family.

17:39.976 --> 17:41.642
- Yeah.
- He wanted to be accepted.

17:41.686 --> 17:43.144
He's from the lgbtq+ community.

17:43.188 --> 17:44.479
I was picking up
more in that world.

17:44.522 --> 17:47.148
- Are we thinking
more lance bass now?
- Oh!

17:47.192 --> 17:49.358
Shouldn't we be happy
ken got out of medicine

17:49.360 --> 17:52.195
because could you imagine
being misdiagnosed like that?

17:53.323 --> 17:56.157
- Ken: How dare you?
- The tin man is wrong.

17:59.245 --> 18:01.829
One thing we do know,
that was an amazing performance.

18:01.873 --> 18:04.373
Caterpillar, nice job.

18:04.375 --> 18:07.585
Watch where you're swinging
that thing.

18:08.963 --> 18:10.922
So cute.

18:10.924 --> 18:13.758
Caterpillar:<i> You know,</i>
<i> this week is all about</i>
<i> giving thanks,</i>

18:13.802 --> 18:17.220
and I am thankful
that jenny didn't push
that take it off buzzer.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.972
I thought for sure
I was a goner.

18:20.016 --> 18:22.183
Nick: All right,
let's keep it going!

18:22.227 --> 18:24.477
Now last time,
robin said queen of hearts

18:24.521 --> 18:27.647
gave the greatest performance
in "masked singer" history,

18:27.649 --> 18:29.857
but what does she have
up her sleeves this week?

18:29.901 --> 18:31.359
Watch this.

18:35.657 --> 18:38.950
One thing I've learned in
my life is the power of words.

18:38.993 --> 18:39.867
When I was discovered,

18:40.161 --> 18:43.287
the press, just,
it wasn't real kind to me.

18:43.331 --> 18:46.207
- Wow.
- Press wasn't kind.

18:46.251 --> 18:48.501
<i> So their words</i>
<i> were real critical,</i>

18:48.545 --> 18:50.920
<i> telling me what I should</i>
<i> and shouldn't wear,</i>

18:50.964 --> 18:52.338
<i> what I should</i>
<i> and shouldn't look like,</i>

18:52.382 --> 18:54.549
<i> all because I was a woman.</i>

18:56.094 --> 18:57.552
<i> But I didn't listen.</i>

19:00.014 --> 19:02.265
<i> I've always written</i>
<i> my own story.</i>

19:02.267 --> 19:05.476

19:12.485 --> 19:15.236
I'm doing this show
to push myself.

19:15.280 --> 19:19.115
<i> After the last performance,</i>
<i>I wanted to pivot a little bit.</i>

19:19.117 --> 19:21.951
I changed the song last minute,
so it's definitely a risk.

19:21.995 --> 19:25.955
<i> Mock rehearsal was terrible.</i>
<i> Like, it was awful.</i>

19:25.999 --> 19:27.456
Okay, we're gonna reset.

19:27.500 --> 19:30.418
I said I wanted to be
challenged, so here I am,

Yeah!

21:41.259 --> 21:43.968
- Wow.
- Unbelievable!

21:44.012 --> 21:48.014
- Wow!
- We're not worthy.

21:48.057 --> 21:49.807
- Bowing to the queen.
- Ken: Oh, my goodness.

21:49.851 --> 21:53.269
We are in the presence
of greatness.
Did you hear that?

21:53.271 --> 21:57.064
- Absolutely.
- Oh, my gosh!

21:57.108 --> 21:58.899
This is the greatest artist

21:58.943 --> 22:01.569
- we've ever had on
"masked singer" ever!
- What? Really?

22:01.571 --> 22:03.988
- Wow!
- Jenny: Ever!

22:03.990 --> 22:05.573
Robin: You're definitely
one of the frontrunners.

22:05.616 --> 22:08.117
That was amazing. Great job.

22:08.161 --> 22:10.953
All right, so who is
the queen of hearts?

22:10.997 --> 22:14.957
Let's see her one word clue.
Turkey drop!

22:15.001 --> 22:18.210
( gobbling )

22:18.254 --> 22:19.837
ken, get the turkey!

22:19.839 --> 22:21.172
Hey, turkey, get the turkey.

22:22.925 --> 22:25.134
It's "home."

22:25.219 --> 22:27.178
- jenny: Ooh!
- Home.

22:27.221 --> 22:28.929
- Ken: Home.
- Does that give you anything?

22:28.973 --> 22:30.348
- A little bit.
- Nicole: Okay.

22:30.391 --> 22:33.684
I mean, the person
I'm thinking of

22:33.686 --> 22:37.396
has a song called "my house,"
and that's a big clue.

22:37.440 --> 22:38.647
Oh!

22:38.691 --> 22:39.982
I'm getting those country vibes.

22:40.026 --> 22:43.194
I think this could be
kacey musgraves, you guys.

22:44.989 --> 22:47.365
Maybe.
You know, I have a feeling

22:47.367 --> 22:49.992
from the voice,
the southern drawl,

22:50.036 --> 22:51.118
and has definitely gone through

22:51.162 --> 22:53.079
very difficult times
with the tabloids.

22:53.122 --> 22:56.374
Maybe the cowboy clue,
she did a remake of "these boots
are made for walking."

22:56.376 --> 22:58.709
could it possibly be
jessica simpson?

22:58.753 --> 23:01.253
- Ooh.
- Oh, that's good.

23:01.297 --> 23:03.923
- Jenny:
It's really great, robin.
- Jessica can sing.

23:03.966 --> 23:06.217
However!

23:06.260 --> 23:08.803
I have been losing sleep
over this one.

23:08.846 --> 23:10.221
- Really?
- Okay? Yes.

23:10.223 --> 23:12.681
- Really?
- I'll take y'all down
my rabbit hole.

23:12.725 --> 23:17.937
So I know that we said
that we do have oscar-nominated
talent in this group.

23:17.980 --> 23:22.400
- Yeah.
- So I'm thinking could it
be jennifer lawrence?

23:22.402 --> 23:26.153
Marion cotillard?
Look, she sounded just
like edith piaf last time.

23:26.197 --> 23:27.863
But then when I went down
that thing,

23:27.865 --> 23:30.241
remember in one
of our clue packages

23:30.284 --> 23:32.326
it said that she was single.

23:32.370 --> 23:35.579
Most of these chicks
is not single.

23:35.581 --> 23:37.039
However!

23:37.083 --> 23:38.374
Listening to that voice

23:38.376 --> 23:40.918
and now tying it in
with today's clues--

23:40.962 --> 23:42.920
oh, my god, she had me
all over the place.

23:42.964 --> 23:45.923
But I heard it tonight,
and that is jewel.

23:45.967 --> 23:48.217
- What?
- Ooh.

23:48.261 --> 23:50.219
- All right.
- Ken: You think it's jewel?

23:50.263 --> 23:52.346
Jewel's outstanding,
don't get me wrong, but I--

23:52.348 --> 23:54.849
- and she is a big jewel.
- No, I get it, robin.

23:54.851 --> 23:56.517
- I get it.
- It's a big ruby.

23:56.561 --> 23:58.394
Ken: No, I get it.
Again, I've met jewel before.

23:58.396 --> 24:01.147
She's from alaska
and not from alabama, right?

24:01.190 --> 24:04.483
Yeah, they don't sound
like that in fairbanks.

24:04.527 --> 24:08.279
Well, whoever it is,
you stole our hearts,
especially mine.

24:08.322 --> 24:11.907
- Ken: Absolutely.
- Stole all of
our hearts, right?

24:11.951 --> 24:13.993
Let's hear it
for the queen of hearts.

24:14.036 --> 24:16.245
Thank you so much, queen.

24:16.247 --> 24:19.832
Queen of hearts was so good,
that was, like, an off with
their heads type performance.

24:19.834 --> 24:21.459
- You know what I mean?
- Ooh!

24:21.502 --> 24:22.877
I mean, ridiculous.

24:22.920 --> 24:24.003
Queen of hearts:
<i> I'm so grateful,</i>

24:24.038 --> 24:25.379

to queen of hearts.

you have the goods.

29:40.362 --> 29:43.113
A famous director
and an actress?

29:43.157 --> 29:44.448
This is my wheelhouse.

29:44.492 --> 29:47.284
Her vocals, I'm just--
I love. That's my jam.

29:47.328 --> 29:51.205
Sutton foster and hugh jackman
are actually gonna star

29:51.248 --> 29:53.874
on broadway together in
"the music man."

29:53.918 --> 29:56.126
and hugh jackman
has directed, so...

29:56.128 --> 29:57.419
Jenny: Does hugh jackman
also play the piano?

29:57.463 --> 29:59.755
- He sure does.
- With a wolverine claw hand.

29:59.799 --> 30:01.957
Right, he's got a claw that can
just rip that thing apart.

30:03.177 --> 30:04.968
You know who else is
a really good piano player?

30:05.012 --> 30:06.512
- Jeff goldblum.
- Ken: Yes.

30:06.555 --> 30:08.889
And his wife emilie
was on "the voice."

30:08.933 --> 30:09.681
- joel: Yes.
- Ken: Oh, really?

30:09.934 --> 30:11.183
- Jenny: Yes!
- Robin: Not bad.

30:11.268 --> 30:14.102
You know, the more talented
these performances,

30:14.146 --> 30:16.647
the harder it is to put
these two names together.

30:16.649 --> 30:19.983
However, a different food group
that's not a banana,

30:20.027 --> 30:22.110
a bacon who's married
to a sedgwick.

30:22.112 --> 30:23.654
- Oh!
- Yes!

30:23.656 --> 30:26.240
Sedgwick sings,
bacon plays many instruments.

30:26.242 --> 30:27.950
- Yes.
- Jenny: That's true.
I like it.

30:27.993 --> 30:30.244
I thought his guess was stupid.

30:30.287 --> 30:33.413
No, in actuality though,
I actually think it might be,

30:33.457 --> 30:34.998
and I'm not kidding,
'cause they said
they worked together,

30:35.417 --> 30:40.295
and she's got an amazing voice,
and he put out an album
last year, a rap album,

30:40.339 --> 30:43.340
so I think it might be
zooey deschanel
and lamorne morris.

30:43.384 --> 30:45.968
- Nicole: Oh, my god!
- Jenny: That's a great guess!

30:45.970 --> 30:49.179
- Joel: She can sing.
- Oh, zooey can sing.

30:49.223 --> 30:50.639
Whoever it is,
it doesn't matter.

30:50.683 --> 30:52.057
They're gonna be in the finals.

30:52.101 --> 30:55.435
It's gonna be a long,
wonderful ride.

The audience is going
bananas for you.

30:58.357 --> 31:00.315
Now go ahead
and head backstage.

31:00.359 --> 31:03.110
Hang out in joel mchale's
dressing room.

31:03.153 --> 31:05.904
- Banana split!
- Robin: Yeah!

31:05.948 --> 31:09.074
Outstanding.

31:09.076 --> 31:12.286
All right, it's been
a rollercoaster season
full of wild cards.

31:12.329 --> 31:14.830
Have we saved
the best for last?

31:14.874 --> 31:16.999
We're about to find out.

31:17.042 --> 31:20.502
Arriving here all the way
from the florida panhandle,

31:20.504 --> 31:25.132
it's high tides and good vibes
with beach ball!

31:31.056 --> 31:33.640
<i> ♪ vacation,</i>

31:38.814 --> 31:41.189
- how many do you think
there's in there?
- Good question.

31:41.233 --> 31:44.026
Nick: This is
an interesting costume.

31:44.069 --> 31:46.361
We about to have a ball, y'all.

31:46.363 --> 31:52.117
- Oh, I love beach ball!
- Bounce, bounce, bounce.

31:54.371 --> 31:57.122
Beach ball:
<i> Coming in as the wild card</i>
<i> definitely makes sense</i>

31:57.166 --> 31:59.625
<i> because my whole life's</i>
<i> kinda been wild.</i>

31:59.668 --> 32:03.629
I was thrown into the game
at a very early age

32:03.672 --> 32:05.631
and in the spotlight
for a very long time.

32:05.674 --> 32:07.257
Child actor.

32:07.259 --> 32:08.800
I have famous recipes,

32:08.802 --> 32:12.387
and I even had a hit single that
I recorded in just one take.

32:12.389 --> 32:14.890
- Okay!
- Director: Action.

32:14.934 --> 32:19.019
And best of all,
I've done it all with my biggest
supporter right by my side...

32:19.063 --> 32:20.687
Peach. Georgia peach.

32:20.731 --> 32:25.025
...Until recently,
when both of us went
our separate ways.

32:27.237 --> 32:30.864
I would call out for them,
and they just weren't there.

32:30.908 --> 32:35.035
When they found out
I was doing the show,
we reconnected.

32:35.079 --> 32:38.288
- And cut! Great job, people!
- ( bell rings )

32:38.332 --> 32:43.251
the greatest thing is
I know my biggest supporter
will always have my back.

32:43.295 --> 32:47.255
So whatever happens tonight,
I'm truly thankful for that.

33:06.860 --> 33:08.986
Jenny: What's happening?

33:08.988 --> 33:12.572

Beach ball, beach ball!

34:42.247 --> 34:45.040
Well, we are definitely
having a ball,

34:45.084 --> 34:47.042
and they came to party.

34:47.086 --> 34:48.251
Nicole: That was fun.

34:48.295 --> 34:51.129
I am a bit freaked out
because I feel like

34:51.173 --> 34:52.881
there are two people
underneath there.

34:52.925 --> 34:54.716
- Nick: Okay.
- I'm stumped.

34:54.718 --> 34:56.802
There were definitely two voices
singing simultaneously.

34:56.845 --> 34:57.803
Yes.

34:57.846 --> 34:58.929
I don't know
if they were singing,

34:59.264 --> 35:01.348
but they were definitely
fighting inside of that thing.

35:01.391 --> 35:02.682
Nicole:
They were having a party.

35:02.726 --> 35:04.226
Oh, that was a party all right.

35:04.228 --> 35:06.895
I will definitely
fight you, joel. Come on.

35:06.939 --> 35:08.647
Nicole: Oh!

35:08.649 --> 35:12.776
All right, it's time for
your first impression guesses.

35:12.778 --> 35:15.487
But the good news is
it's your last one
of the season.

35:15.531 --> 35:17.239
Yay!

35:17.241 --> 35:19.032
Write down your guesses,
attach them to the beach ball,

35:19.034 --> 35:20.283
and toss them up here.

35:20.327 --> 35:22.619
Yeah, you do you think
it's two or up to five?

35:23.956 --> 35:25.580
I think it's two people.

35:25.582 --> 35:26.998
I don't know.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.458
Come on, before you wipe out.

35:32.297 --> 35:35.298
- Joel: Oh, my gosh.
- Come on, now. Serve it up!

35:35.342 --> 35:38.051
- Oh, no! It fell!
- Oh, my guess!

- Yeah!
- Ken: Jenny! Nice.

35:42.975 --> 35:44.474

- Go, nicole.

35:44.518 --> 35:47.060
Yeah! Aww.

35:54.236 --> 35:57.946
- Look at that! Nick cannon!
- That's a host.

35:57.990 --> 36:00.615
Somebody come lock these
in the lair.

36:00.659 --> 36:02.576
This is how nick
takes his kids to daycare.

36:05.330 --> 36:07.789
All right, robin,
what you picking up on?

36:07.833 --> 36:10.458
I do have a couple of names
just from the fun
of this performance.

36:10.502 --> 36:12.460
- We saw a georgia peach, right?
- Yep.

36:12.462 --> 36:15.088
Dakota and elle fanning
are from georgia.

36:15.132 --> 36:17.215
- Oh, I like it.
- Ken: Oh, good guess.

36:17.259 --> 36:19.718
But I'm getting the side ball
on this one.

36:19.761 --> 36:22.345
Somebody's in the back, too.
They said something back here.

36:22.389 --> 36:25.599
- Let the lady
in the back talk.
- What'd you say?

36:25.601 --> 36:27.684
I don't think that's it!

36:27.728 --> 36:29.644
Nick: They almost got, like,
a little southern thing.

36:29.688 --> 36:30.937
"I don't think that's it."

36:31.023 --> 36:33.940
okay, well, there was also
a money symbol, right?

36:33.984 --> 36:36.109
- In the clue package.
- Yeah.

36:36.153 --> 36:38.945
What about if
it's the "2 broke girls,"

36:38.989 --> 36:40.280
kat dennings and beth behrs?

36:40.324 --> 36:44.117
- Ken: Oh, okay.
- I was thinking that, too.

36:44.161 --> 36:46.036
Uh-oh, something's
happening inside the ball.

36:46.079 --> 36:47.746
Are they--
oh, is that a yes?

36:47.789 --> 36:50.457
Who is driving the ball?
That's what I wanna know.

36:50.500 --> 36:52.834
I'll tell you
who controls the ball.

36:52.878 --> 36:56.254
Kris jenner, the mother
of the duo inside.

36:56.256 --> 36:59.174
I believe this is
kim and chloe kardashian.

36:59.176 --> 37:03.762
- Dollar bill. Very rich.
- I'm getting more of
a kendall/kylie vibe...

37:03.805 --> 37:05.055
- Nicole: Yeah!
- ...Than chloe/kim.

37:05.098 --> 37:08.391
I think it's diseck
and rob kardashian, so...

37:08.393 --> 37:10.685
Nick: You guys are all over
the place with this one.

37:10.729 --> 37:13.230
- What?
- Well, you know what?
One thing we do know.

37:13.232 --> 37:15.899
We had a lot of fun
with the beach ball.
Y'all make some noise.

37:15.943 --> 37:17.859
Ken: Yeah.

37:17.861 --> 37:19.027
Thank you, beach ball.

37:19.071 --> 37:22.113
- Whoo!
- Oh, they're funny.

37:29.957 --> 37:32.249
and we're stuffed
with gratitude.

37:32.251 --> 37:34.251
But now it's time
to get serious

37:34.253 --> 37:36.795
because somebody's
gotta leave the competition.

37:36.797 --> 37:42.467
Studio audience and panel,
time to vote for your favorite.

37:42.511 --> 37:46.221
The singer with the least amount
of votes will be unmasked.

37:46.265 --> 37:48.265
The people have spoken.

37:48.267 --> 37:53.061
The singer headed home
tonight is...

37:53.105 --> 37:54.312
Come on, dawg.

But we can't wait to see
who is inside this beach ball.

38:36.273 --> 38:39.816
- All: Yes.
- But first, men in black,

38:39.860 --> 38:43.486
bring out the first impression
guesses from the vault.

38:55.167 --> 39:00.286
All right, now, ken, you said
kim and chloe kardashian.

39:00.297 --> 39:04.090
- Yep.
- That is a very,
very valuable ball.

39:04.134 --> 39:06.259
- Billion dollar ball.
- Nick: There it is.

39:06.303 --> 39:08.928
Ken: I think,
just based on the clues,

39:08.930 --> 39:09.929
this is someone
who's really rich.

39:09.973 --> 39:12.390
This is someone who is lavish,

39:12.392 --> 39:14.225
so I'm sticking
with it, daddy.

39:14.227 --> 39:17.479
Well, jenny, you actually
thought it was a kim as well,

39:17.481 --> 39:19.647
- but not a kardashian.
- Correct.

39:19.649 --> 39:23.276
Your first impression guess
was kim zolciak and erika jayne.

39:24.863 --> 39:26.821
Yeah, 'cause they both
had hit songs.

39:26.865 --> 39:30.992
- Oh, yeah.
- But I think this might be
snooki and jwoww.

39:30.994 --> 39:35.497
They would totally have a party
inside of a ball.

39:37.158 --> 39:40.293
Guys, they literally brought
the shore to the stage.

39:41.421 --> 39:43.213
Nick: Joel,
your first impression guess

39:43.256 --> 39:46.049
was tiffany pollard
and tori spelling.

39:46.093 --> 39:47.801
Interesting combination.

39:47.844 --> 39:51.054
I'm anticipating
they will have a show
at some point.

39:51.098 --> 39:52.597
Yeah, are you sticking
with that?

39:52.599 --> 39:54.391
No.

39:54.393 --> 39:57.644
I'm gonna go with snooki
and jwoww

39:57.687 --> 39:59.020
on jenny's suggestion.

39:59.064 --> 40:02.023
I like that.

40:02.067 --> 40:04.359

40:04.361 --> 40:08.446

and the other girl
from "barb and star."

40:10.575 --> 40:12.409
that's what you wrote.

40:12.452 --> 40:16.371
Listen, barb and star
went to vista del mar,

40:16.373 --> 40:19.124
and then they came
on "the masked singer,"
and now they're beach balls.

40:19.167 --> 40:21.251
- Come on!
- Robin: Yeah.

40:21.294 --> 40:23.545
It's kristen wiig
and annie "muh-luh-loh."

what was it like
being inside that beach ball?

41:23.398 --> 41:25.648
Um, it was definitely
very hot.

41:25.692 --> 41:27.192
And we had a lot of things
going on.

41:27.194 --> 41:30.236
We had to move mouth, make sure
we don't roll off the stage.

41:30.280 --> 41:33.656
- Like, it was a lot.
- Who was in the back
of the ball?

41:33.658 --> 41:36.993
- She was in the back
of the ball.
- Oh, bless.

41:37.037 --> 41:37.869
You know I gotta be

- Ken: Aw, yeah.

41:40.332 --> 41:44.250

Thank you so much.

41:46.463 --> 41:48.171
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

41:49.716 --> 41:53.176
So in the clues you guys talked
about having some time apart.

41:53.220 --> 41:56.971
- Can you talk about that?
- You know,
I was in my addiction.

41:56.973 --> 41:58.890
I was away from my kids
for two years.

41:58.934 --> 42:02.060
Now I'm fixing to celebrate
two years clean.

42:02.103 --> 42:03.394
Good for you.

42:03.396 --> 42:08.024
So this is the first project
outside of our show

42:08.068 --> 42:09.526
