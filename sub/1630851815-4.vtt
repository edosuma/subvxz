00:16.541 --> 00:18.083
Let me tell you something.

00:18.166 --> 00:22.000
There's an old saying in baseball,
"Play the game the right way."

00:22.500 --> 00:26.500
It's something coaches tell players
from tee-ball to the big leagues.

00:27.250 --> 00:29.041
And it's something Romare Bearden,

00:29.541 --> 00:32.916
one of the best pitchers in the world
during the 1930s,

00:33.416 --> 00:35.083
was very familiar with.

00:42.083 --> 00:46.666
In order to realize his dreams of
playing for the Philadelphia Athletics...

00:48.375 --> 00:50.958
he had to play the game the right way.

00:52.291 --> 00:54.250
But what does that mean exactly?

00:57.500 --> 01:01.250
In the end,
this star baseball player proved

01:01.750 --> 01:05.916
that what you start out as
isn't always what you become.

01:19.875 --> 01:23.208
As a kid, I loved playing baseball.

01:23.291 --> 01:25.916
A lot of people think
it was my best sport.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.208
They're probably right.

01:28.125 --> 01:31.125
So why didn't Colin Kaepernick,
the NFL quarterback,

01:31.208 --> 01:34.250
become Colin Kaepernick,
the Major League pitcher?

01:42.583 --> 01:44.958
When I was in high school,
I was always sick.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.208
The cold, the flu.
If it was going around, I would catch it.

01:50.916 --> 01:54.750
But the sickest I ever felt was
at the end of my junior year.

01:55.416 --> 01:57.166
Last game of the season.

01:57.250 --> 01:58.458
Play ball!

01:58.541 --> 02:00.416
Bottom of the seventh inning.

02:06.083 --> 02:08.833
-Strike two!
-Oh! Whoo!

02:08.916 --> 02:12.416
-Are you seeing what I'm seeing?
-Everyone is seeing it.

02:12.500 --> 02:14.291
Let's go, Colin!

02:14.875 --> 02:17.958
-Every cough set my lungs on fire.

02:18.708 --> 02:22.666
Every breath felt like
knives stabbing me in the chest.

02:23.791 --> 02:24.625
And the crowd...

02:25.750 --> 02:28.041
I could lie and tell you
I didn't hear them,

02:28.541 --> 02:29.791
but I did.

02:31.333 --> 02:34.416
Got nothing! This boy's got nothing!

02:34.500 --> 02:35.708
Let's go!

02:37.291 --> 02:40.375
Every single word.

02:40.458 --> 02:43.041
Don't let that boy strike you out, Johnny!

03:07.833 --> 03:09.291
Come on!

03:13.875 --> 03:15.166
All right, baby!

03:15.250 --> 03:16.458
Come on!

03:17.833 --> 03:19.041
Out!

03:19.541 --> 03:21.875
That's my Colin! That's a no-no!

03:22.833 --> 03:24.791
-What?
-Look at the scoreboard!

03:25.291 --> 03:26.750
You pitched a no-hitter!

03:26.833 --> 03:28.458
You're like the future of baseball!

03:28.541 --> 03:30.750
-Good noise, bad noise.

03:30.833 --> 03:34.333
At the end of the day,
you can't let it get in the way.

03:35.458 --> 03:38.000
Colin, you are dehydrated
because you have pneumonia.

03:38.875 --> 03:44.541
And how in the hell did you hang a no-no
on Los Banos with this fever, huh?

03:45.125 --> 03:46.708
The toilets...

03:47.625 --> 03:49.250
are our biggest rivals, doc.

03:49.333 --> 03:51.708
-I couldn't let my team down.

03:52.208 --> 03:55.041
Gonna be using this thing
in the big leagues?

03:55.625 --> 03:59.583
It will either be pitching,
or throwing touchdowns.

04:00.083 --> 04:01.458
Still trying to decide.

04:01.541 --> 04:05.375
Well, as your doctor,
I would recommend sticking with baseball.

04:05.458 --> 04:08.458
You don't want your brain
turned into mush from all of those hits.

04:09.208 --> 04:12.500
-They gotta try and sack me first, doc.

04:12.583 --> 04:16.416
Smart, athletic, and confident.
Your phone must be ringing off the hook.

04:16.500 --> 04:18.416
The phone was ringing off the hook.

04:18.500 --> 04:19.416
Hmm.

04:19.500 --> 04:22.083
But they weren't the calls
I was hoping for.

04:22.750 --> 04:23.750
Hello?

04:25.958 --> 04:30.041
Sorry, coach, he's not feeling well.
You're gonna have to call back.

04:31.541 --> 04:32.708
Tomorrow's fine.

04:33.291 --> 04:34.125
Okay.

04:35.416 --> 04:37.291
Okay. Bye.

04:40.416 --> 04:44.833
That was the last call I answer.
It's your job.

04:44.916 --> 04:46.625
Not as fun as it looks, huh?

04:47.375 --> 04:48.375
Don't worry.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.375
-My five-minute break is almost up.
-That's what you said five minutes ago.

04:55.833 --> 04:58.208
Early favorites are out for the Heisman.

04:58.916 --> 05:04.166
They like Bush, Leinart,
and your guy from Texas, Vince Young.

05:04.250 --> 05:05.583
What's not to like?

05:07.375 --> 05:09.666
Dual-threat quarterbacks are taking over.

05:10.166 --> 05:13.666
Then Coach Parker needs
to let you start running more.

05:14.250 --> 05:17.166
How are colleges gonna see what you can do
if he won't let you?

05:17.250 --> 05:19.375
He says I need to put on weight.

05:19.458 --> 05:22.166
Maybe I need to borrow
your metabolism for a little bit.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.583
Oh, my ribs.

05:27.375 --> 05:28.666
Good one, smartass.

05:29.250 --> 05:32.458
Maybe you need to borrow
some of my football scholarships too.

05:32.541 --> 05:34.666
Nope. I'm good.

05:36.083 --> 05:37.458
I'll have my own soon.

05:49.416 --> 05:52.458
All right, all right. I got it.

05:54.583 --> 05:56.791
Kaepernicks, we love the troops.

05:57.958 --> 05:59.250
There we go, Colin, nice.

05:59.833 --> 06:03.083
After the no-hitter,
I was the man at school.

06:06.333 --> 06:08.041
Yo, Colin.
Congrats on the no-hitter.

06:08.125 --> 06:10.833
I heard the Yankees offered you a million.
Is that true?

06:10.916 --> 06:13.708
-Yeah, is that true?
-Back up. Let the man live.

06:15.791 --> 06:17.458
It ain't never gonna stop, is it?

06:17.541 --> 06:18.875
Not until you decide.

06:18.958 --> 06:21.291
Then everybody'll beg you
for money and tickets.

06:21.375 --> 06:23.333
You finally might lose your virginity.

06:23.416 --> 06:24.875
Oh, your mom didn't tell you?

06:26.708 --> 06:28.750
Can you sign this for my dad?
He's a big fan.

06:28.833 --> 06:30.916
No problem. Depends on what you got on it.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
We accept cash, cash, and cash.

06:33.083 --> 06:35.125
And even though
the only thing on my mind

06:35.208 --> 06:36.708
was getting a football scholarship...

06:36.791 --> 06:39.166
Tell your dad I appreciate the support.

06:39.250 --> 06:42.041
...I allowed myself
to enjoy the love a little bit.

06:43.291 --> 06:47.208
Hey, I forgot to tell you.
Coach Schott was looking for you.

06:47.291 --> 06:48.958
When isn't that man looking for me?

06:49.041 --> 06:51.250
So, uh, what are we doing tonight?

06:51.791 --> 06:56.500
I'm probably gonna go to Walcott's later,
but I gotta handle some business first.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.416
I'm down. What's the biz?

06:59.208 --> 07:01.750
You ain't ready to hang with the big boys.

07:01.833 --> 07:04.750
-Your parents would kill you.
-You act like I ain't grown.

07:04.833 --> 07:07.458
You a grown nerd
with the highest GPA on the team.

07:08.333 --> 07:10.708
Hurry up, get to class.
You don't wanna be late.

07:10.791 --> 07:12.958
-You're not coming?
-In a little bit.

07:13.041 --> 07:15.541
This bowl in my truck
ain't gonna smoke itself.

07:16.250 --> 07:18.416
-Hey, take some good notes for me.
-Mm-hm.

07:18.500 --> 07:21.666
Big smile.
Like you just won the World Series.

07:24.458 --> 07:27.833
Everybody was waiting
to hear my decision about baseball.

07:27.916 --> 07:29.333
And I mean everybody.

07:29.833 --> 07:31.666
And it was getting annoying.

07:31.750 --> 07:34.333
Everything we talked about today
is gonna be on the test.

07:34.416 --> 07:36.958
So I wanna see everyone
taking crazy good notes.

07:37.041 --> 07:39.291
If you have questions, ask them now.

07:39.375 --> 07:43.250
-We're on page 424, chapter six.

07:43.916 --> 07:44.750
Hello?

07:45.291 --> 07:46.833
Okay. I'll let him know.

07:47.333 --> 07:50.500
Hey, Colin? Coach Schott
would like to see you in his office.

07:51.125 --> 07:53.500
-About what?
-I don't know. All right...

07:53.583 --> 07:56.541
When it came to
making a decision about my life,

07:56.625 --> 07:59.416
I had a lot of people
wanting me to do one thing

07:59.500 --> 08:02.208
and tell me all about what matters.

08:04.666 --> 08:06.208
What matters to them.

08:26.458 --> 08:27.833
You wanted to see me, coach?

08:28.500 --> 08:32.625
When I call a pitch,
I expect you to throw that pitch.

08:32.708 --> 08:35.208
If you try that in the bigs,
your ass will be toast.

08:36.041 --> 08:36.916
Yes, sir.

08:43.791 --> 08:48.000
Wait. I got some good news.
Great news, actually.

08:49.291 --> 08:51.875
It's your invite
to the Area Code Games this summer.

08:53.250 --> 08:55.875
We did it. Congratulations, son.

09:00.666 --> 09:03.250
Wow. Cool.

09:03.916 --> 09:04.791
"Cool"?

09:08.041 --> 09:08.875
"Cool"?

09:08.958 --> 09:10.291
I mean, you're invited

09:10.375 --> 09:13.166
to the most prestigious showcase
in high school baseball,

09:13.250 --> 09:14.708
and all you can say is, "cool"?

09:16.583 --> 09:20.166
Colin, do you know
how hard I've been working for you?

09:20.708 --> 09:25.458
I've been talking to coaches and scouts
day and night, singing your praises.

09:27.666 --> 09:28.541
You know...

09:29.791 --> 09:33.250
Coach, I don't want you to think
I'm not appreciative,

09:33.791 --> 09:36.666
or that I don't recognize
what you're doing, but, you know...

09:37.166 --> 09:40.083
I just wanna keep my options open.
With football.

09:40.666 --> 09:43.000
If you dropped football
and focused on baseball,

09:43.083 --> 09:45.875
you could be the next Dontrelle Willis.

09:48.666 --> 09:51.416
I mean, what if I drop baseball instead?

09:53.375 --> 09:55.791
You drop baseball,
you're dropping your future.

09:57.041 --> 09:59.708
Baseball scholarships
are flooding in every day.

09:59.791 --> 10:02.500
You don't have a single one for football.

10:02.583 --> 10:05.333
Zero. Zip. Zilch.

10:06.250 --> 10:08.500
Well, not yet.

10:09.083 --> 10:11.208
But I will. Soon.

10:11.291 --> 10:13.500
Yeah? But what if you don't?

10:14.458 --> 10:17.791
Everybody thought
because I didn't have a football offer,

10:18.291 --> 10:22.250
that I should just be happy
and accept the baseball offers.

10:23.375 --> 10:24.291
Hey, Mom.

10:25.708 --> 10:27.208
Dinner will be ready in 20.

10:27.916 --> 10:30.208
Hey, Dad. Any coaches call today?

10:30.916 --> 10:31.958
You serious?

10:33.333 --> 10:34.333
About football?

10:35.375 --> 10:36.208
Not yet.

10:37.208 --> 10:38.291
Be patient.

10:39.958 --> 10:41.250
Keep working hard.

10:41.333 --> 10:43.875
I wasn't ready
to give up on my dream...

10:44.583 --> 10:45.416
I am.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.750
...even if other people were.

10:48.250 --> 10:51.791
Not only am I the best player on the
football team, I'm also the best looking.

10:51.875 --> 10:55.041
It's only natural
girls at Pitman flock to my jock.

10:55.125 --> 10:57.125
They know they're looking at a superstar.

10:57.208 --> 10:59.500
Just remember
who the coaches are coming to see.

10:59.583 --> 11:02.000
Colin, make that arm is ready
to throw me the ball.

11:02.083 --> 11:03.958
Why? So you can fumble it?

11:04.041 --> 11:06.416
-"So you can fumble it?"
-How are the camps going?

11:07.041 --> 11:10.000
Good. You know,
I've just been doing my thing.

11:10.666 --> 11:13.250
Coaches still think
I'm trying to play baseball.

11:13.833 --> 11:14.666
You're not?

11:14.750 --> 11:17.250
You know how much you can make
in the Major Leagues?

11:17.333 --> 11:20.875
You could finally afford some rims
and stop rolling on them dusty factories.

11:20.958 --> 11:24.375
Yeah, I'll remember that
next time you ask me for a ride.

11:24.458 --> 11:27.958
Thankfully, I don't need one today.
Jordan, you ready to go?

11:28.041 --> 11:30.791
Yeah. Same time next week?

11:30.875 --> 11:34.000
Nah, I'll let y'all know.
Might be at one of those camps.

11:34.500 --> 11:36.708
-Football or baseball?
-Not sure yet.

11:37.208 --> 11:39.291
It's crazy
that you're that good at football.

11:39.375 --> 11:41.250
It's not even your best sport.

11:54.750 --> 11:56.833
-Yo.
-Yo.

11:56.916 --> 12:00.750
Can I kick it at your spot for a minute?
I don't feel like going home yet.

12:01.375 --> 12:02.791
-Nah.
-Nah?

12:02.875 --> 12:04.708
I got errands with Max and CJ.

12:04.791 --> 12:08.000
-All right, whatever.
-You gonna miss me or something?

12:09.083 --> 12:11.291
Catch you later. I'll hit you up.

12:23.375 --> 12:26.000
Everybody wanted me to play baseball.

12:28.666 --> 12:30.500
All the schools wanted me.

12:33.125 --> 12:36.583
The offers were all there,
but my heart wasn't.

12:37.916 --> 12:39.166
It was with football.

12:41.791 --> 12:43.666
A place where no one wanted me.

12:47.416 --> 12:50.208
There's always going to be
moments that shake you up.

12:50.916 --> 12:53.916
But when I saw
I was just a two-star prospect...

12:54.458 --> 12:57.750
I wasn't prepared
to see how the world was seeing me.

13:01.583 --> 13:02.875
I'll get it, Mom.

13:02.958 --> 13:04.625
Got a surprise for you, bro.

13:12.125 --> 13:15.250
I can't let you ride around
on them dusty rims.

13:15.333 --> 13:17.541
Damn. Where'd you get these?

13:17.625 --> 13:18.541
Jacked them.

13:19.125 --> 13:21.875
Nah, I'm just messing with you.
I got them from my cousin.

13:21.958 --> 13:24.500
A tree fell on his car
and the rims are still good.

13:24.583 --> 13:26.541
-He said I can have them.
-All right.

13:29.125 --> 13:32.083
-How much you want for them?
-They're on the house.

13:32.166 --> 13:35.583
Just make sure to pass me the ball
every once in a while.

13:35.666 --> 13:36.958
We're about to be seniors.

13:37.041 --> 13:39.041
This is my last chance
to impress the girls.

13:39.125 --> 13:42.125
And lace me up with Super Bowl tickets
when you're on the Raiders.

13:42.208 --> 13:44.500
Raiders? You mean the Packers.

13:44.583 --> 13:46.333
Yeah, I forgot you're a cheesehead.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.541
These would look so good on my baby too.

13:56.500 --> 13:59.250
I can't take these.
My parents would flip out.

13:59.333 --> 14:01.083
Why? They're from my cousin.

14:01.166 --> 14:03.916
Imagine my mom's face
when she sees these on my truck.

14:04.500 --> 14:08.000
No worries. I'll just
find someone else who might want them.

14:08.708 --> 14:10.875
You're still passing me the rock.

14:10.958 --> 14:12.291
No doubt. Peace.

14:12.375 --> 14:16.541
It's true in life and in sports.
Decisions are funny things.

14:16.625 --> 14:20.708
In some moments, you know exactly
when you're making the right one.

14:21.541 --> 14:24.416
When they say,
"Play the game the right way,"

14:24.500 --> 14:26.166
what are they really saying?

14:26.833 --> 14:30.625
In the early 1930s,
Romare Bearden found out.

14:31.625 --> 14:36.583
When Bearden got to Philly, the Athletics
were anxious for him to sign his contract.

14:37.125 --> 14:41.083
He was going to be the first
Black player in the Major Leagues,

14:41.166 --> 14:43.375
years before Jackie Robinson.

14:44.041 --> 14:47.875
All he had to do
was sign on the dotted line.

14:48.791 --> 14:52.125
There was just one more little thing.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.375
In order to make his contract official,

14:55.875 --> 14:58.041
in order to realize his dreams,

14:58.625 --> 15:01.000
he was told
he would have to play as a white man.

15:01.083 --> 15:03.208
You'll have to pass as a white man.

15:10.083 --> 15:11.750
He rejected the offer.

15:12.583 --> 15:16.375
What Bearden learned then
is something I learned in high school.

15:16.875 --> 15:19.416
And something
America has always taught us.

15:20.166 --> 15:24.375
Playing ball the right way
means playing ball the white way.

15:27.916 --> 15:31.000
And in many ways, the rules of the game

15:31.083 --> 15:35.625
reflect the code of behavior
expected in American society.

15:39.416 --> 15:43.375
I was at the Area Code Games,
and I was supposed to be excited.

15:43.958 --> 15:45.083
But all I could think of

15:45.166 --> 15:49.541
was that baseball was starting to feel
more and more like a backup plan.

15:50.125 --> 15:53.750
Take this game, for instance.
It was the same as any other.

15:54.458 --> 15:58.458
Except this time, there was
another kid who looked like me.

16:00.416 --> 16:01.916
Strike three! You're out!

16:08.166 --> 16:10.625
We gave each other a nod of recognition.

16:15.958 --> 16:20.250
Hey! No fraternization on the field.
Respect the game!

16:21.125 --> 16:23.791
Whether it was the spectators
or the umpires,

16:23.875 --> 16:27.125
in baseball, something always seemed off.

16:31.625 --> 16:36.916
Like baseball, America selectively chooses
when to enforce its rules.

16:37.500 --> 16:41.375
Sometimes they let you
express your rights, sometimes they don't.

16:41.958 --> 16:45.583
When they see
the rules don't apply to everyone equally,

16:45.666 --> 16:47.916
they say they're willing to change them.

16:48.583 --> 16:53.333
But just because rules are changed,
doesn't mean hearts are changed.

16:53.416 --> 16:55.250
The question becomes,

16:55.333 --> 16:58.500
is it in your heart
to play by their rules?

16:58.583 --> 17:00.250
Let's get this over with.

17:04.666 --> 17:07.208
I'm the head baseball coach
at the University of Texas.

17:07.791 --> 17:08.833
Cal-Berkeley.

17:08.916 --> 17:10.250
UCLA.

17:10.333 --> 17:11.666
Harvard University.

17:11.750 --> 17:16.500
-The Arizona State University.
-If you come to Texas, we will make you...

17:16.583 --> 17:18.000
-A star.
-A superstar.

17:18.083 --> 17:21.125
You come with LSU,
you'll be the next Dave Stewart.

17:21.208 --> 17:22.333
The next Dwight Gooden.

17:22.416 --> 17:24.875
-The next...
-D-Train, Dontrelle Willis.

17:24.958 --> 17:26.416
The next Jackie Robinson.

17:26.500 --> 17:30.000
Did you know
that he went to UCLA? Oh, yeah.

17:30.083 --> 17:32.750
We're excited
to offer you a full scholarship.

17:32.833 --> 17:33.875
Full scholarship.

17:33.958 --> 17:34.916
A free ride.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.541
We don't offer baseball scholarships,
but with your grades,

17:38.625 --> 17:41.125
you'll have no problem
getting an academic scholarship.

17:41.208 --> 17:45.291
At Arizona State,
grades will be the least of your concerns.

17:45.375 --> 17:46.291
Go, Devils.

17:46.875 --> 17:51.791
Now, technically, I'm not supposed to
give you any gear, but...

17:51.875 --> 17:53.541
Don't tell anybody I gave you this.

17:53.625 --> 17:55.041
Let's keep this between us.

17:59.583 --> 18:00.625
He's here.

18:04.083 --> 18:07.583
I saw you at the Area Code Games.
You got the goods, kid.

18:08.083 --> 18:10.833
Now, you can go to college, play for free.

18:11.333 --> 18:14.041
Put on that freshman 15, bottom out,

18:14.125 --> 18:17.208
and be back here in Turlock in a few years
selling used Fords.

18:17.708 --> 18:22.833
Or you can go pro and be
a millionaire by your 19th birthday.

18:22.916 --> 18:24.625
Come on, really? A millionaire?

18:24.708 --> 18:29.416
Mrs. Kaepernick, your son has one of
the best arms I've seen on a kid his age.

18:29.500 --> 18:31.458
He'll be one of the top picks
in the draft.

18:35.125 --> 18:39.208
There can be all kinds of reasons
to do what people want you to do.

18:44.333 --> 18:47.916
-What if I wanna play football?
-We'll still draft you.

18:48.583 --> 18:52.166
And when you see the signing bonus
we'll give you, you'll change your mind.

18:52.250 --> 18:56.541
But there's only ever one reason
to actually do anything.

18:58.666 --> 19:00.041
You on a diet or something?

19:01.333 --> 19:03.041
Just not that hungry.

19:03.125 --> 19:05.208
Can I get one of them tacos then?

19:12.000 --> 19:15.041
-Catch up with you later.
-Yo, where are we going?

19:15.541 --> 19:18.958
I gotta take care of something
right quick. All right?

19:19.041 --> 19:21.583
-You stay here.
-Why you always ditching me?

19:22.625 --> 19:24.750
Trust me. It's for your own good.

19:24.833 --> 19:26.708
How are you supposed to tell me that?

19:26.791 --> 19:28.500
You're supposed to be my boy.

19:28.583 --> 19:30.458
This ain't what you want, bro.

19:30.541 --> 19:32.708
I don't even know what I want anymore.

19:34.166 --> 19:38.083
What happened to, "I'm a quarterback"?
That's not what you want?

19:41.583 --> 19:45.291
We're halfway through senior season,
and I still don't have any offers.

19:45.916 --> 19:47.166
-Yo, Colin.
-What?

19:47.250 --> 19:49.625
You sound like a punk-ass cry baby.

19:50.541 --> 19:53.750
Nothing in life worth having comes easy.

19:53.833 --> 19:54.833
All right?

19:56.375 --> 20:00.916
-I'll see you later, bro.
-A'ight. I see how it is.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.833
No, you don't. If you did,
you wouldn't be so mad right now.

20:14.291 --> 20:17.625
Jake wasn't wrong.
I knew I was moping.

20:18.291 --> 20:22.416
I knew no one could understand
why I wasn't taking the easy choice.

20:23.375 --> 20:25.625
But I couldn't shake how I felt.

20:26.208 --> 20:30.333
Sometimes, you just feel what you feel
and nothing will change your mind.

20:30.416 --> 20:32.666
Coach, there's gotta be
something we can do.

20:32.750 --> 20:34.291
Can we try Fresno State again?

20:34.791 --> 20:39.166
I know they said they weren't taking
any new QBs, but it's worth a shot.

20:44.625 --> 20:46.041
-You didn't hear?
-What?

20:47.125 --> 20:51.416
They signed a quarterback.
Some kid from a JUCO down south.

20:52.000 --> 20:52.875
Come on.

20:53.791 --> 20:55.666
Hey, I know you don't wanna hear this,

20:56.375 --> 20:59.500
but junior college
may not be a bad idea for you too.

20:59.583 --> 21:00.416
What?

21:01.375 --> 21:03.125
I'm not going to a JUCO.

21:04.458 --> 21:05.916
I'm a D1 quarterback.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.416
Okay, we both know that.

21:07.916 --> 21:11.833
So I want you to
leave it all on the field in the playoffs.

21:11.916 --> 21:14.250
You put together a few good games,

21:15.166 --> 21:18.458
win Section Championship, then...

21:20.041 --> 21:21.791
Keep your chin up, Colin.

21:22.541 --> 21:23.708
There's still time.

21:38.125 --> 21:38.958
You're late.

21:40.583 --> 21:43.541
Why are we even here anyway?
The place is closed.

21:44.166 --> 21:46.916
I know the manager.
She was supposed to hook us up.

21:47.458 --> 21:51.166
Real talk, Taco Bell should
start serving breakfast. I'd eat it.

21:51.250 --> 21:54.750
-I'm surprised you invited me out.
-What's that supposed to mean?

21:54.833 --> 21:57.416
-We're supposed to be friends.
-We are.

21:57.500 --> 21:59.458
So why you always ditching me?

21:59.541 --> 22:02.875
Maybe I'm ditching you
because we're friends.

22:02.958 --> 22:05.333
Come on, man. Don't do that.

22:06.708 --> 22:07.958
Let me show you something.

22:16.166 --> 22:18.750
-Is that from...?
-Yeah, I started a little side hustle.

22:18.833 --> 22:20.291
Selling car parts and whatnot.

22:20.375 --> 22:23.625
-You mean jacking car parts?
-Tomato-tomahto.

22:23.708 --> 22:26.291
Okay, so why won't you let me come?

22:28.166 --> 22:30.083
You're 6'13" and Black.

22:30.666 --> 22:33.916
There is only one person in Turlock
that fits that description.

22:34.666 --> 22:36.791
If I get caught, I might go to jail.

22:37.541 --> 22:39.916
But if I get caught with you,
I might get shot.

22:41.375 --> 22:42.541
Not funny, Jake.

22:44.166 --> 22:45.875
You have a chance to be special.

22:46.541 --> 22:50.250
Maybe baseball isn't what you want,
but it's a way out of here.

22:51.125 --> 22:52.208
That's the thing.

22:55.291 --> 22:56.708
It's not the future I want.

22:56.791 --> 22:58.750
Then go get the future you want.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.458
Life's too short
to be living someone else's dream.

23:07.791 --> 23:11.791
Damn. That might be
the realest thing you ever said.

23:11.875 --> 23:15.708
I can't take credit for that one.
I read it in Playboy as a kid.

23:18.625 --> 23:20.958
I learned a lot of things that summer.

23:21.041 --> 23:22.916
Summer of my senior year.

23:23.500 --> 23:25.666
But the one thing I remember most

23:26.166 --> 23:28.666
is you gotta
play the game that's right for you.

23:28.750 --> 23:33.083
Coach Schott called
to see if you're ready for tomorrow.

23:34.875 --> 23:37.541
He asked if you've made your decision yet.

23:37.625 --> 23:39.708
Can we send out some more tapes?

23:39.791 --> 23:41.708
A very wise man once said,

23:42.625 --> 23:48.458
"Things work out best for those who
make the best of the way things work out."

23:49.041 --> 23:53.250
Look, we know that this is your decision.

23:54.208 --> 23:55.625
And we support you.

23:57.250 --> 24:00.416
But what's wrong with baseball?

24:02.333 --> 24:03.625
It's not football.

24:05.458 --> 24:10.583
No, but it is a way
to get a free education,

24:11.208 --> 24:12.583
make some great money.

24:13.458 --> 24:17.750
With football,
I feel like myself. I feel comfortable.

24:17.833 --> 24:20.833
Baseball, I'm a visitor, an outsider.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.500
I don't know. It's hard to explain.

24:24.583 --> 24:27.666
We know how bad
you wanted this thing to happen.

24:28.583 --> 24:29.666
But it didn't happen.

24:31.083 --> 24:32.375
Like Mom said...

24:33.791 --> 24:35.125
It's your decision.

24:36.875 --> 24:40.458
But sometimes in life,
the decisions are already made for you.

24:45.166 --> 24:49.041
And sometimes,
you make the decision for yourself.

24:55.583 --> 24:58.250
Hey, Kaepernick. Right on time.

24:59.208 --> 25:01.083
So I talked to Coach Parker.

25:01.958 --> 25:05.458
I just want you to know, I'm sorry
it didn't work out with football.

25:06.166 --> 25:10.291
But like I told you back in spring,
baseball is your future.

25:14.333 --> 25:18.500
So which school? You made your decision?

25:20.083 --> 25:21.958
Well, what is it?

25:23.791 --> 25:25.541
I'm gonna be a quarterback.

25:32.833 --> 25:36.916
It's the biggest mistake of your life.
You're gonna look back on this.

25:37.458 --> 25:38.833
You're gonna regret it.

25:39.958 --> 25:40.833
Forever.

25:42.291 --> 25:43.875
The hell are you thinking?

25:50.708 --> 25:53.500
I was thinking
that what you start out as

25:53.583 --> 25:56.000
is not necessarily what you become.

25:59.666 --> 26:03.541
Bearden continued in the Negro Leagues
for a few more seasons

26:03.625 --> 26:07.333
before shifting his focus
to another passion: art.

26:08.958 --> 26:13.583
He went on to become one of the most
influential artists of the 20th Century...

26:16.708 --> 26:19.083
using his brilliant folk collages

26:19.166 --> 26:24.041
to showcase the harsh reality
of the Black experience in America.

26:24.125 --> 26:25.791
Many others would follow.

26:26.875 --> 26:28.708
Bearden was good at baseball,

26:29.208 --> 26:33.208
but because he didn't sell his soul,
he found his true love.

26:33.916 --> 26:37.750
For me, I played baseball
because I was good at it.

26:38.416 --> 26:42.916
My passion, my love,
was being a quarterback.

26:48.833 --> 26:52.250
Damn, I didn't think
everybody would be this mad at me.

26:52.333 --> 26:54.916
You had the winning lottery ticket
and you threw it away.

26:55.416 --> 26:58.041
My dad says you're making
the biggest mistake of your life.

26:58.125 --> 26:59.916
Your dad works at Blockbuster.

27:01.916 --> 27:07.833
Kaepernick was projected to be a top pick
in the 2006 MLB Draft.

27:07.916 --> 27:12.291
Now he waits for a football scholarship
that may never come.

27:12.375 --> 27:16.083
A lot of people are
scratching their heads about this one.

27:18.625 --> 27:19.791
What do they know?

27:32.625 --> 27:33.458
Hello?

27:38.416 --> 27:39.250
Really?

27:41.125 --> 27:42.583
I'll grab him for you.

27:43.458 --> 27:44.375
Colin?

27:47.958 --> 27:49.166
Baseball?
