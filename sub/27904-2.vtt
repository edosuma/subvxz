WEBVTT

00:04.439 --> 00:05.788
Lowell, how could
your wife leave a man

00:05.831 --> 00:07.616
that makes biscuits this fluffy?

00:07.659 --> 00:10.227
When you move
into your own place,

00:10.271 --> 00:13.100
don't bother getting a bed,
just make a giant one of these.

00:14.666 --> 00:16.625
Cooking for you guys
is the least I can do.

00:16.668 --> 00:18.409
You took me in
at my darkest hour,

00:18.453 --> 00:22.239
when my soul was shattered
and all hope was lost.

00:23.284 --> 00:24.459
That's the frittata.

00:26.156 --> 00:28.245
We have never eaten
like this before.

00:31.466 --> 00:34.034
Uh, we cook for you every day.

00:34.077 --> 00:36.166
I stand by what I said.

00:37.950 --> 00:39.865
Hey, honey, you know
what I realized?

00:39.909 --> 00:42.129
We've been working
together for a week.

00:42.172 --> 00:45.915
Today is our one week
workaversary.

00:45.958 --> 00:47.438
Oh, wow, yeah.

00:47.482 --> 00:49.049
Uh, I got you something.

00:49.092 --> 00:51.268
I'm just waiting
on a tracking number.

00:51.312 --> 00:53.836
Oh, come on.
Seriously, this is big.

00:53.879 --> 00:57.057
I mean, I think we're past the
bumpy getting used to it phase

00:57.100 --> 00:58.710
and on to smooth sailing.

00:58.754 --> 01:00.799
Toot, toot!

01:00.843 --> 01:04.064
Today's Mommy's big day
to show us the sample finishes

01:04.107 --> 01:05.848
that she picked out
for the flip house.

01:05.891 --> 01:07.632
What's a sample?What's a finish?

01:07.676 --> 01:09.852
What's a flip house?

01:09.895 --> 01:11.984
The house we've been
fixing up to sell.

01:12.028 --> 01:13.899
We've been talking
about it for weeks.

01:13.943 --> 01:17.816
You know, we listen
to all your boring stories.

01:17.860 --> 01:20.863
Mr. 45 Minutes on what
happened in some video game.

01:21.951 --> 01:23.518
All right, come on.
We better get going.

01:23.561 --> 01:25.520
Oh, Lowell, do you need
a ride to work?I'll meet you there.

01:25.563 --> 01:27.478
I have to stop by the grocery
store to pick up buttermilk

01:27.522 --> 01:29.611
for Fried Chicken Friday.

01:29.654 --> 01:32.092
Now that's a wife.

01:33.702 --> 01:36.574
I hope Lowell never leaves.

01:36.618 --> 01:38.272
No, no, no, no. We...

01:38.315 --> 01:41.101
We want our friend to get
his confidence back,

01:41.144 --> 01:43.581
move into his new apartment
and start his new life.

01:43.625 --> 01:46.628
Sure, just as long as it's after
Fried Chicken Friday.

01:54.462 --> 01:56.638
Ha, ha. You were quiet,
you thought we'd forget

01:56.681 --> 01:59.293
to take you to school.
Come on, let's go.

01:59.336 --> 02:01.686
ANDI:
So,

02:01.730 --> 02:03.123
that's the kitchen.

02:03.166 --> 02:06.648
Crisp, elegant, a world above.

02:06.691 --> 02:08.606
I got that
from a vodka commercial,

02:08.650 --> 02:09.999
but y-you get my point.

02:10.042 --> 02:11.392
I love it.

02:11.435 --> 02:12.697
This is like one
of those kitchens

02:12.741 --> 02:14.177
the lady on Fixer Upper
would make.

02:16.223 --> 02:18.660
Her name is Joanna Gaines,
and that is the nicest thing

02:18.703 --> 02:19.922
you've ever said to me.

02:21.228 --> 02:22.620
Well, what are
you thinking, Don?

02:22.664 --> 02:25.754
To be honest, I was thinking
about Lowell's biscuits.

02:27.625 --> 02:29.584
He loves it.
All right, so, uh,

02:29.627 --> 02:31.890
all we have left
is the backsplash?

02:31.934 --> 02:35.633
Yeah, yeah. I'm thinking,
let's blow people's minds

02:35.677 --> 02:39.028
with this gorgeous
Peruvian tile.

02:39.071 --> 02:41.030
Eh, that stuff's expensive.

02:41.073 --> 02:42.597
Okay? I'm thinking
we need something

02:42.640 --> 02:45.556
a little less Peruvian,
a little more Home Depot-vian.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.167
And you know,
I've checked

02:47.210 --> 02:48.385
the comps for this neighborhood,

02:48.429 --> 02:50.126
and they don't support
high-end finishes.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.955
Values in this neighborhood
are up ten percent.

02:52.998 --> 02:55.479
Buyers are gonna be looking
for something more custom.

02:55.523 --> 02:57.525
Maybe, maybe,
but that's a gamble.

02:57.568 --> 02:59.918
Okay? And last time we gambled,

02:59.962 --> 03:02.138
you got pregnant
for the third time.

03:03.661 --> 03:05.750
Guys, can I say something?

03:05.794 --> 03:08.710
I don't even remember
eating the last biscuit.

03:08.753 --> 03:11.234
All right, look. Okay,
we both have some good points,

03:11.278 --> 03:12.714
so it's a tie.

03:12.757 --> 03:16.108
But at work, tie goes
to the boss, so the answer's no.

03:16.152 --> 03:17.675
But it's imported.

03:17.719 --> 03:18.894
No.

03:18.937 --> 03:20.112
Artisan.

03:20.156 --> 03:21.113
No.

03:21.157 --> 03:22.637
That means hand-painted.

03:22.680 --> 03:25.335
Oh. Well, then, no.

03:25.379 --> 03:27.337
Wow.

03:27.381 --> 03:29.165
Three no's.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.514
That's a lot of no's.

03:30.558 --> 03:33.648
Oh, come on, honey.

03:33.691 --> 03:36.564
You're not gonna get mad just
because I said no to some tile?

03:36.607 --> 03:41.177
Well, no, it's not the no,
it's just, you had a tone.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.570
I had a tone?

03:42.613 --> 03:43.962
Yeah. "Tie goes to the boss"?

03:44.006 --> 03:45.137
I mean, who says that?

03:45.181 --> 03:47.314
The boss.

03:47.357 --> 03:49.925
Okay. You know what?
I'm a professional.

03:49.968 --> 03:51.405
I can handle it.

03:51.448 --> 03:52.536
Great.

03:52.580 --> 03:54.146
Don't touch me.

03:54.190 --> 03:55.583
Come on.

03:55.626 --> 03:57.715
I thought we were
smooth sailing.

03:57.759 --> 04:00.022
Toot, toot.

04:00.065 --> 04:02.372
You should go
with the nice tile,

04:02.416 --> 04:04.244
'cause this might be
where you're living now.

04:18.432 --> 04:19.520
Hey.
Hey.

04:19.563 --> 04:20.825
Thanks for coming to pick us up.

04:20.869 --> 04:22.871
Andi's still mad
about that tile,

04:22.914 --> 04:25.961
so she drove herself and
my truck keys to work.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.181
It was a very quiet dinner
last night.

04:29.225 --> 04:31.053
If I can't win her over
with my Beef Wellington,

04:31.096 --> 04:32.272
you know Mama's cranky.

04:33.403 --> 04:35.840
Well, it got worse
when we went upstairs.

04:35.884 --> 04:38.103
She made me watch
Sex and the Cityreruns.

04:39.104 --> 04:40.541
That is the longest I've gone

04:40.584 --> 04:43.195
without laughing
in my entire life.

04:43.239 --> 04:45.633
You and Andi are creating
a hostile work environment.

04:45.676 --> 04:49.593
I may need a couple weeks off.

04:49.637 --> 04:53.641
The problem is, Andi's not
used to me saying no to her.

04:53.684 --> 04:55.469
You say it to us all the time.

04:55.512 --> 04:56.992
That's because you guys are men,

04:57.035 --> 04:59.864
and you understand that
no is the end of it.

04:59.908 --> 05:02.389
But women are stronger
than us. They don't give up.

05:02.432 --> 05:05.000
That's why theygive birth.

05:05.043 --> 05:07.350
We'd be like, oh, forget
it, just leave it in,

05:07.394 --> 05:08.960
I'll loosen my seatbelt.

05:10.571 --> 05:12.877
Like how my wife wouldn't
take no for an answer

05:12.921 --> 05:15.315
when she asked if she could
sleep with other men.

05:19.014 --> 05:22.713
Lowell, your thing is not
like other things, okay?

05:22.757 --> 05:26.456
When Andi and I were first
married, I said no a lot.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.937
But then I noticed something:
it didn't work.

05:30.068 --> 05:31.766
Do you think I said yes to this?

05:31.809 --> 05:33.376
Huh?

05:33.420 --> 05:36.161
A giant painting of a tricycle?

05:36.205 --> 05:41.645
I said no to her 20 times,
but she asked me 21 times,

05:42.646 --> 05:45.780
Why a tricycle? I don't get it.

05:45.823 --> 05:49.566
So when she hears a no from you,
it's a shock to the system.

05:49.610 --> 05:51.525
Right, right.
And now that I'm her boss,

05:51.568 --> 05:54.223
I'm gonna have
to say no to her all the time.

05:54.266 --> 05:56.051
Marcy hates it when I say no.

05:56.094 --> 05:57.182
So whenever

05:57.226 --> 05:58.749
she brings up something
I disagree with,

05:58.793 --> 06:01.796
I just say "Yeah, maybe."

06:01.839 --> 06:05.669
"Yeah, maybe"?

06:05.713 --> 06:07.932
Yeah. It's like
a softer version of no.

06:09.151 --> 06:10.282
I can't say a real no to her.

06:10.326 --> 06:12.284
She'll rip my arms off.

06:12.328 --> 06:15.984
And I need my arms.
That's where I keep my hands.

06:16.027 --> 06:17.986
And that works?

06:18.029 --> 06:19.509
Every time.

06:19.553 --> 06:21.598
She feels like
I'm thinking about it--

06:21.642 --> 06:24.514
which I'm not-- time passes,

06:24.558 --> 06:27.038
and then it just goes away.

06:27.082 --> 06:29.345
I'll be in the truck.

06:34.872 --> 06:38.093
Am I crazy, or did he just
say something helpful?

06:38.136 --> 06:40.530
I'm as stunned as you are.

06:40.574 --> 06:43.533
"Yeah, maybe." Huh.

06:43.577 --> 06:46.014
Next time Andi brings up
the tile, I'm using that.

06:46.057 --> 06:48.016
I can't sleep when
we're fighting.

06:48.059 --> 06:50.975
Okay? Usually I'm the big spoon
and she's the little spoon.

06:51.019 --> 06:54.109
But you can't cuddle
with an angry spoon.

06:54.152 --> 06:56.938
That's just a fork.

07:00.811 --> 07:03.248
Oh, hey, Andi. You okay?

07:03.292 --> 07:05.381
Ugh, I've been all over town
trying to find a cheaper tile

07:05.425 --> 07:07.775
that'll work, but I know that
the one I picked is perfect.

07:07.818 --> 07:10.430
And then, I got so distracted
thinking about how right I was,

07:10.473 --> 07:12.823
that I drove onto the front lawn
of the library.

07:12.867 --> 07:15.391
Maybe let Adam have this one.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.785
In the marriage book
I'm reading, a little late--

07:17.828 --> 07:20.004
I said it before you could--

07:20.048 --> 07:22.006
they say the best gift
you give yourself

07:22.050 --> 07:24.356
is the one you give
your partner.

07:24.400 --> 07:26.489
Yeah, I'm not doing that.

07:28.056 --> 07:30.972
I mean,
this is my first big idea

07:31.015 --> 07:32.277
for Burns Brothers, you know?

07:32.321 --> 07:33.627
And how we handle this
is gonna decide

07:33.670 --> 07:35.150
how we handle everything else.

07:35.193 --> 07:36.630
I don't know,
the tile

07:36.673 --> 07:39.284
is a great idea
Adam hasn't recognized yet.

07:39.328 --> 07:41.504
Ugh, husbands are weird.

07:41.548 --> 07:44.202
Last night, Don handed me
a bunch of biscuit crumbs

07:44.246 --> 07:46.988
from his pocket and asked me
to reverse engineer it.

07:48.250 --> 07:50.252
Like Jurassic Park,he said.

07:50.295 --> 07:52.820
You know, when
we were first married,

07:52.863 --> 07:54.996
I had to convince Adam
of everything.
Oh.

07:55.039 --> 07:57.564
But you know, I'd just keep
explaining how what I wanted

07:57.607 --> 08:00.088
was a good idea until
he realized he was wrong.

08:01.655 --> 08:03.918
Like that tricycle painting.

08:05.136 --> 08:06.747
He didn't want it, and now,

08:06.790 --> 08:08.531
he loves it as much as I do.

08:08.575 --> 08:11.578
Are you sure he loves it?

08:11.621 --> 08:14.319
Oh, yeah.
: Okay?

08:14.363 --> 08:17.801
I mean, sometimes
I catch him staring at it,

08:17.845 --> 08:21.936
shaking his head, wondering
how he could've been so wrong.

08:22.980 --> 08:24.373
You'll wear him down eventually.

08:24.416 --> 08:26.418
I believe in you.I don't have time.

08:26.462 --> 08:29.726
I mean, every day we own
that house, we're losing money.

08:29.770 --> 08:31.119
We got to keep things moving.

08:31.162 --> 08:33.338
You're making this
way too complicated.

08:33.382 --> 08:34.818
He's a guy.

08:34.862 --> 08:38.169
You know what to do. Sex him up.

08:38.213 --> 08:39.519
If you don't want to do it,
that's fine.

08:39.562 --> 08:40.911
Just don't have a backsplash.

08:40.955 --> 08:42.696
No backsplash? Well...

08:42.739 --> 08:44.524
Huh, better go shave my legs.

08:58.407 --> 08:59.713
Hey.

09:02.846 --> 09:05.022
Hey.

09:05.066 --> 09:08.417
So,

09:08.460 --> 09:13.683
Lowell took the kids
to the movies.

09:15.511 --> 09:19.210
So it's just you and me.

09:24.302 --> 09:28.437
I think I dripped
a little salsa on that arm.

09:28.480 --> 09:30.439
I like it, señor.

09:30.482 --> 09:32.615
It makes you spicy.

09:34.835 --> 09:36.793
Okay, well,

09:36.837 --> 09:39.622
I guess you're not
mad at me anymore.

09:39.666 --> 09:42.843
Well, if you're talking
about the flip house,

09:42.886 --> 09:44.627
we both want the same thing.

09:44.671 --> 09:47.630
Right? To make the most money
when we sell it.

09:47.674 --> 09:49.893
Which is why

09:49.937 --> 09:53.505
I really think...

09:53.549 --> 09:55.638
Hmm.

09:55.682 --> 09:58.075
...we need...

10:00.121 --> 10:04.865
...that gorgeous Peruvian tile.

10:04.908 --> 10:07.432
Ha! There it is.

10:07.476 --> 10:09.870
Okay, I'm onto you.What?

10:09.913 --> 10:11.654
You're using sex
to get your way?

10:11.698 --> 10:16.703
Ooh, I want to be mad at you,
but I just can't. What...

10:16.746 --> 10:18.530
Come on, honey.

10:18.574 --> 10:22.491
I-I... I really think the
tile is the way to go.

10:22.534 --> 10:26.060
Just, I just want you
to trust me on this.

10:26.103 --> 10:27.714
What do you say?

10:27.757 --> 10:29.324
I...

10:36.200 --> 10:38.725
Uh...

10:38.768 --> 10:42.119
Yeah, maybe.

10:42.163 --> 10:44.295
Roger that.

10:52.739 --> 10:55.611
All right.

10:55.655 --> 10:58.788
All right.

10:58.832 --> 11:01.922
I'm glad we talked
about this.

11:01.965 --> 11:04.185
Me, too. Yeah.

11:04.228 --> 11:07.014
Now let's go upstairs,
Señor Spicy.

11:08.842 --> 11:11.453
You are a good person.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.893
ANDI:
Leave the chips.

11:24.727 --> 11:26.860
Hey, Don.

11:26.903 --> 11:28.644
You are a genius.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.211
I get that a lot.

11:30.254 --> 11:33.475
So Andi tried to manipulate me
with sex to get that tile,

11:33.518 --> 11:36.652
but I used your trick
and she gave up on it,

11:36.696 --> 11:38.785
and then we still went upstairs.

11:38.828 --> 11:41.004
It was just like an episode
of Sex and the City,

11:41.048 --> 11:43.093
but with more laughs.

11:43.137 --> 11:44.791
I wish I could've
been there to see it.

11:44.834 --> 11:46.706
Just the first part,
not the gross part.

11:47.750 --> 11:48.708
Hey, guys.

11:48.751 --> 11:49.926
Hey.

11:49.970 --> 11:51.232
Hey, there's
my pretty lady.

11:51.275 --> 11:53.060
Aww. Hey, um, where do you want
the delivery guy

11:53.103 --> 11:54.322
to put the Peruvian tile?

11:54.365 --> 11:56.063
What?

11:56.106 --> 11:59.022
I didn't approve that.
I said, "Yeah, maybe."

11:59.066 --> 12:01.024
Right. The "yeah"
meant you approved

12:01.068 --> 12:03.505
and the "maybe" meant, "only if
I thought it was a good idea,"

12:03.548 --> 12:05.550
which I did.
You know what, I'll just,

12:05.594 --> 12:06.769
I'll just have him
take it around back.

12:10.947 --> 12:13.820
Don't look at me,
you did it wrong.

12:13.863 --> 12:15.778
I told you to say,
"Maybe, yeah."

12:15.822 --> 12:19.782
No, you said, "Yeah, maybe."

12:19.826 --> 12:21.088
I would never say "yeah, maybe"

12:21.131 --> 12:22.567
because "yeah, maybe"
means yeah.

12:22.611 --> 12:23.960
Everyone knows that.

12:24.004 --> 12:26.789
You know why
you like biscuits so much?

12:26.833 --> 12:28.399
'Cause that's what your brain
is made of.

12:35.450 --> 12:38.061
Thanks to you, this whole thing
just got ten times worse.

12:38.105 --> 12:41.238
Now I have to tell Andi no
when she thinks I told her yes.

12:41.282 --> 12:43.763
She's really not gonna like
my tone on that.

12:43.806 --> 12:44.938
So let her have the tile.

12:44.981 --> 12:47.070
I can't do that.

12:47.114 --> 12:48.724
This is our first
work disagreement, okay?

12:48.768 --> 12:50.682
How this plays out
sets a precedent

12:50.726 --> 12:52.684
for our whole
working relationship.

12:52.728 --> 12:54.948
She needs to respect me
as her boss.

12:54.991 --> 12:57.385
I don't see that happening.

12:58.690 --> 13:00.475
Look, I know the tile
is a little thing,

13:00.518 --> 13:02.085
but this is what happened
at home.

13:02.129 --> 13:04.261
I gave in on little stuff,
next thing I know,

13:04.305 --> 13:06.611
she's driving the bus.
This is my bus,

13:06.655 --> 13:09.832
I get to drive it!
Hey, hey.

13:09.876 --> 13:12.617
It's our bus.
We're Burns Brothers, remember?

13:12.661 --> 13:13.836
We're partners.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.795
That's right.

13:15.838 --> 13:18.188
That's right,
you're her boss, too,

13:18.232 --> 13:21.148
but she's not your wife,
so you can say no to her

13:21.191 --> 13:23.585
and it's no big deal.
What do you say?

13:23.628 --> 13:26.196
Maybe, yeah.

13:26.240 --> 13:28.590
All right, well,
you think about it.

13:30.331 --> 13:32.420
Wait a minute,
that does work!

13:35.466 --> 13:38.774
Andi, we need
to talk.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.254
Okay, what's up?

13:40.297 --> 13:42.604
I'm gonna stop you
right there.

13:42.647 --> 13:46.390
Look, Adam's not your only boss,
I'm your boss, too.

13:46.434 --> 13:49.263
And as such, I'm saying no
to that Peruvian tile.

13:49.306 --> 13:53.267
So you can box it up
and send it all back to Peruvia.

13:53.310 --> 13:55.704
Peru.

13:55.747 --> 13:58.402
Pretty sure I'm right.

14:00.143 --> 14:01.623
Anyway, it's not happening.
The answer's no.

14:01.666 --> 14:04.234
Done talking, final answer, no.

14:04.278 --> 14:08.804
Okay, you're the boss, but, uh,
can I ask you something?

14:08.848 --> 14:12.329
Did, uh, did Adam
put you up to this?

14:12.373 --> 14:14.201
What?

14:14.244 --> 14:16.594
Adam doesn't tell me what to do.

14:16.638 --> 14:20.120
Yeah. I bet he told you
to do this.

14:20.163 --> 14:22.905
And he didn't even ask you
how you felt about it, did he?

14:22.949 --> 14:24.167
He did not.

14:27.431 --> 14:31.958
I mean, would a brother treat
a brother that way in Peruvia?

14:32.001 --> 14:34.177
He would not.

14:37.964 --> 14:39.966
Hey, guys.

14:44.448 --> 14:46.973
Andi and Don would like me
to tell you

14:47.016 --> 14:48.539
that they don't like your tone.

14:50.585 --> 14:54.328
She already turned you?
You weak-minded fool.

14:54.371 --> 14:56.460
I didn't do anything.

14:56.504 --> 14:58.027
He doesn't like
your tone, either.

14:58.071 --> 15:01.204
Oh, it's got nothing to do
with my tone, okay?

15:01.248 --> 15:03.119
You just don't like
hearing the word no.

15:07.297 --> 15:08.908
Okay, fine,

15:08.951 --> 15:10.866
I don't like hearing no,
especially when I'm right.

15:10.910 --> 15:13.521
Ha, I knew it! My tone is great.

15:13.564 --> 15:16.524
In the morning, animals gather
around me like I'm Cinderella.

15:16.567 --> 15:18.482
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:18.526 --> 15:20.049
You're wasting your time.
He doesn't listen.

15:20.093 --> 15:21.485
I tried to teach you
"yeah, maybe"

15:21.529 --> 15:23.270
to get you out of this jam,
but you screwed it up.

15:23.313 --> 15:25.402
Well, you did it again!
You just said, "Yeah, maybe."

15:25.446 --> 15:26.664
No, I said "maybe, yeah."

15:26.708 --> 15:29.493
This guy.

15:29.537 --> 15:32.757
Tell you what, Don and Lowell
both work with you,

15:32.801 --> 15:35.760
so raise your hand
if you think Adam

15:35.804 --> 15:37.675
doesn't always listen
to your ideas.

15:40.374 --> 15:44.378
I'm not seeing any hands.

15:44.421 --> 15:47.511
All I'm saying is
consider the possibility

15:47.555 --> 15:50.297
that you don't always
recognize a good idea.

15:50.340 --> 15:53.953
Like the tricycle painting you
didn't want and now you love.

15:55.998 --> 15:58.261
I love?
Yeah.

15:58.305 --> 15:59.523
I hate that painting.

15:59.567 --> 16:01.134
What?

16:01.177 --> 16:03.266
I knew that. I knew he
didn't like the painting.

16:03.310 --> 16:04.964
I've been playing
both sides on this one.

16:08.663 --> 16:10.621
But I convinced you I was right.

16:10.665 --> 16:12.797
What? You didn't convince me
of anything.

16:12.841 --> 16:14.060
You outlasted me.

16:14.103 --> 16:15.148
You're like the

16:15.191 --> 16:17.846
Everlasting Gobstopper
of arguing.

16:17.889 --> 16:20.457
But it's poignant.

16:20.501 --> 16:21.850
It's got nothing
to do with us.

16:21.893 --> 16:23.417
Whenever someone new
comes over the house,

16:23.460 --> 16:24.635
they look at that painting
and they say,

16:24.679 --> 16:26.202
"Oh, do you collect
tricycles?

16:26.246 --> 16:29.075
"Uh, did your grandfather
invent the tricycle?

16:29.118 --> 16:32.469
"What's-what's, what's with
the weird tricycle?"

16:32.513 --> 16:34.384
I finally lied
and just started saying

16:34.428 --> 16:36.517
it's a tricycle
because we have three kids.

16:36.560 --> 16:38.910
That is why
it's a tricycle!

16:40.651 --> 16:43.480
Oh.

16:43.524 --> 16:45.221
Yeah. I still hate it.

16:45.265 --> 16:48.137
I just wish I would've
stuck to my guns,

16:48.181 --> 16:49.486
like I'm doing
with your fancy tile.

16:49.530 --> 16:51.662
Yeah, well, I'm sticking
to my guns, too.

16:51.706 --> 16:54.230
Well, then I don't know
what to do.

16:54.274 --> 16:57.016
Well, I don't know
what to do either.

16:58.930 --> 17:00.845
Hey, here's an idea.

17:00.889 --> 17:02.412
Let's make a fancy backsplash
out of that painting.

17:02.456 --> 17:03.935
Kill two birds.

17:03.979 --> 17:06.329
Oh, yeah?
I got two birds for you.

17:08.853 --> 17:12.031
Very nice.
You have children!

17:17.819 --> 17:19.429
All right.

17:19.473 --> 17:21.779
I had a lot of time
to think in there,

17:21.823 --> 17:23.172
thanks to Lowell's jambalaya.

17:23.216 --> 17:26.349
Here's the thing.

17:26.393 --> 17:28.221
I like working together.

17:28.264 --> 17:30.092
You're a
great designer

17:30.136 --> 17:33.226
and you look smoking hot
in a hard hat.

17:35.141 --> 17:37.839
That's a good opening line,
I'm listening.

17:37.882 --> 17:40.363
Honey, our marriage
means everything to me,

17:40.407 --> 17:43.453
but in business you need
a boss who has final say

17:43.497 --> 17:45.455
or it's chaos.

17:45.499 --> 17:47.240
I get that.

17:47.283 --> 17:49.155
Just like here at home,
where you get the final say,

17:49.198 --> 17:50.634
which makes sense

17:50.678 --> 17:54.116
because you care about the kids
way more than I do.

17:54.160 --> 17:58.164
I love them,
but their stories are so boring.

17:58.207 --> 17:59.469
Okay, so what do you suggest?

17:59.513 --> 18:01.341
I mean, you were
in there for a while

18:01.384 --> 18:02.864
so I know you have a plan.

18:02.907 --> 18:06.172
Yeah, okay, all right,
here's my offer.

18:06.215 --> 18:09.305
You get to pick where
you want to drive the bus.

18:09.349 --> 18:12.003
Now, you can keep
driving it here at home,

18:12.047 --> 18:14.745
or you can start
driving it at work.

18:14.789 --> 18:16.312
But before
you answer,

18:16.356 --> 18:17.748
you should know
that, last week,

18:17.792 --> 18:20.142
when I was supposed to take
the kids to the dentist,

18:20.186 --> 18:22.362
we got lost and just went
to Dairy Queen.

18:22.405 --> 18:25.147
That's the opposite
of the dentist.

18:26.627 --> 18:29.020
Okay, I'm...

18:29.064 --> 18:30.587
I'm gonna stick with home.

18:30.631 --> 18:32.502
Great, and I will
stick with work.

18:32.546 --> 18:35.592
And from now on,
I will watch my tone

18:35.636 --> 18:38.160
when I say things like this:

18:38.204 --> 18:42.295
Darling, love of my life,
I already returned the tile.

18:42.338 --> 18:47.038
Okay, that's your call
and I respect that.

18:47.082 --> 18:49.780
Great. So are we good?

18:49.824 --> 18:51.347
Yeah, we're good.

18:53.044 --> 18:55.612
So, what do you
want to do now?

18:55.656 --> 18:58.049
Well...

18:58.093 --> 19:00.313
I was thinking...
Yeah?

19:00.356 --> 19:02.532
...we could watch some
Sex and the City.

19:02.576 --> 19:04.012
Really?

19:04.055 --> 19:05.927
Yeah, Carrie's got problems.

19:05.970 --> 19:07.233
Mr. Big won't commit!

19:12.325 --> 19:15.502
Morning, Lowell.
Morning.

19:15.545 --> 19:17.417
I've decided to move back
to my apartment.

19:17.460 --> 19:19.897
Are you sure?
You're-you're welcome to stay.

19:19.941 --> 19:22.422
Oh, h-how about this,
stay through the week,

19:22.465 --> 19:26.513
and then we'll do a big send-off
after Fried Chicken Friday.

19:26.556 --> 19:29.298
No, it's too much.

19:29.342 --> 19:31.387
First you're fighting,
then you're fooling around,

19:31.431 --> 19:32.867
then it sounds like
you're fighting,

19:32.910 --> 19:34.347
but I can't tell the difference.

19:34.390 --> 19:37.306
You heard us?

19:37.350 --> 19:39.656
The guest room shares a wall
with the master.

19:39.700 --> 19:41.702
I might as well
be in there with you.

19:43.356 --> 19:46.359
Well, that's
new information.

19:46.402 --> 19:48.491
We've had a lot of people
stay in that guest room.

19:48.535 --> 19:50.972
Maybe that's why we never got
another exchange student.

19:51.015 --> 19:52.669
Oh.

19:52.713 --> 19:57.108
I have to ask you,
who is Señor Spicy?

19:57.152 --> 19:58.762
All right.

19:58.806 --> 20:00.286
He has a lovely
singing voice.

20:00.329 --> 20:02.026
Yeah, good luck to you.
See you later.

20:10.296 --> 20:12.863
Hey, what are
you doing?

20:12.907 --> 20:14.517
I'm taking it down.

20:14.561 --> 20:16.737
I don't want you to be unhappy
in your own living room.

20:16.780 --> 20:19.348
No, you can leave it up there.

20:19.392 --> 20:22.046
I've kind of gotten
used to it,

20:22.090 --> 20:24.266
like your extra long middle toe.

20:24.310 --> 20:26.703
Hey, that's good luck.

20:28.488 --> 20:30.403
But about the painting,
thank you,

20:30.446 --> 20:31.665
You're welcome.

20:31.708 --> 20:33.754
But if I ever kill something
with a big head,

20:33.797 --> 20:35.799
it's going up there.

20:35.843 --> 20:38.715
Maybe, yeah.

20:38.759 --> 20:41.283
Okay, it's settled.
