WEBVTT

00:03.294 --> 00:05.964
- Like you went shopping
in my shopping bags.

00:06.047 --> 00:07.215
Turn around.

00:07.298 --> 00:11.177
Yeah, I'm gonna look good
when I get to wear that.

00:11.261 --> 00:13.263
- Hey, I need
to bring the heat.

00:13.346 --> 00:14.806
It's the first day
of sophomore year.

00:14.889 --> 00:18.810
Molly and I are gonna be part of
the coolest clique in school--

00:18.893 --> 00:22.647
as soon as we figure out
which one that is.

00:22.731 --> 00:23.732
- Here's a clue.

00:23.815 --> 00:25.108
If they're willing to
take you, keep looking.

00:28.027 --> 00:31.448
Hey, Steph, if I eat your
over-priced onion garbage,

00:31.531 --> 00:32.281
can I take one of
these cupcakes?

00:32.365 --> 00:34.367
- James, I told you--

00:34.451 --> 00:36.411
anything in a pink box is for
my party-planning business.

00:36.494 --> 00:38.788
- Then I'd like to hire
you for a party in my stomach.

00:38.872 --> 00:42.292
I'll need one
cupcake, please.

00:42.375 --> 00:43.960
- Boy, close the fridge.

00:47.881 --> 00:48.173
- [sighs loudly]

00:52.051 --> 00:54.012
I hate the first
day of school.

00:54.095 --> 00:56.806
No more kids around
to do all my fun stuff with.

00:56.890 --> 01:00.059
- Dad, there was nothing fun
about that Civil War auction.

01:00.143 --> 01:01.311
- Oh, no?

01:01.394 --> 01:03.313
Well, you grabbed my bidding
paddle awfully fast

01:03.396 --> 01:04.980
when they brought out
that cannon.

01:05.063 --> 01:05.940
- Because I wanted
to buy it, climb in,

01:06.024 --> 01:09.652
and shoot myself home.

01:09.736 --> 01:12.322
And why are you complaining
about the first day of school?

01:12.405 --> 01:15.158
I'm the one who got stuck with
Mr. Shank for history.

01:15.241 --> 01:16.993
- [laughing]
No way. You got Shanked?

01:17.076 --> 01:21.831
He gives more homework
than any teacher in school.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.124
- Well, seventh grade
is the time

01:23.208 --> 01:24.417
when you're supposed
to buckle down

01:24.501 --> 01:25.502
and start hitting
the books.

01:25.585 --> 01:26.419
- Okay, I heard your
best shot, Dad.

01:26.503 --> 01:27.837
What have you got, Steph?

01:27.921 --> 01:29.589
- Well, if the workload
really gets to be

01:29.672 --> 01:31.591
too much for you, I guess
I can talk to him.

01:31.674 --> 01:32.759
- You'd talk
to my teacher?

01:32.842 --> 01:36.679
Have we learned
nothing from third grade?

01:36.763 --> 01:38.181
- All right, last year,
Mrs. Gosnold and I

01:38.264 --> 01:43.102
had our differences.
- You killed our class rabbit.

01:43.186 --> 01:45.021
- That was one of them.

01:45.104 --> 01:46.356
- And you knocked out
her front teeth

01:46.439 --> 01:48.775
playing parent-teacher
dodge ball.

01:48.858 --> 01:51.361
- Mrs. Gosnold knew
what she was getting into.

01:51.444 --> 01:54.531
- She was getting
into our car.

01:54.989 --> 02:01.955
- ♪

02:02.038 --> 02:02.455
♪ Yeah Hey ♪

02:02.539 --> 02:08.586
♪

02:08.669 --> 02:10.588
♪ Huh Huh Huh Huh ♪

02:10.672 --> 02:12.423
♪ Huh Huh Huh Huh ♪

02:12.507 --> 02:14.133
♪ Huh Huh Huh Huh ♪

02:15.260 --> 02:17.387
{\an8}- Uh-huh. That's nice.
That's nice.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.889
{\an8}I like it! I like it!

02:19.973 --> 02:23.184
{\an8}- Stephanie, you said one quick
picture and you'd be gone.

02:23.268 --> 02:25.728
{\an8}Why aren't you gone?

02:25.812 --> 02:28.857
{\an5}- Huh, I went to school with
a girl named Donna Dreyfus.

02:28.940 --> 02:30.358
{\an8}But there is no way
my Donna Dreyfus

02:30.441 --> 02:33.194
{\an8}is a fourth grade teacher.

02:33.278 --> 02:34.404
{\an8}Student, maybe.

02:34.487 --> 02:35.947
{\an8}She was dumb as a stump.

02:36.030 --> 02:37.490
{\an8}We used to call
her Donna Doofus.

02:37.574 --> 02:41.953
{\an8}- Great story. Bye!

02:42.036 --> 02:43.329
{\an8}- She always wanted
to fight me.

02:43.413 --> 02:44.873
{\an8}She'd tell me to meet
her at the flagpole at 3:00,

02:44.956 --> 02:45.915
{\an8}but she wouldn't show
up until 4:00,

02:45.999 --> 02:47.250
{\an8}'cause she couldn't
tell time.

02:47.333 --> 02:51.379
{\an8}- I can and it's
time to go.

02:51.462 --> 02:54.591
{\an8}- That girl was dumb.

02:54.674 --> 02:58.595
{\an8}That girl is here.

02:58.678 --> 03:01.222
{\an8}That's Donna Doofus.

03:01.306 --> 03:03.266
{\an8}- Stephanie Turner?

03:03.349 --> 03:05.184
{\an8}- Donna Dreyfus?

03:05.268 --> 03:06.060
{\an8}What a surprise.

03:06.144 --> 03:07.353
{\an8}It's Stephanie Phillips now.

03:07.437 --> 03:09.105
{\an8}- Look at you--married.

03:09.188 --> 03:13.776
{\an8}- And look at you--
still in the fourth grade.

03:13.860 --> 03:17.572
- I'm the teacher.
Can you believe it?

03:17.655 --> 03:20.575
- No, I really can't.

03:20.658 --> 03:22.285
- And who is this
young man?

03:22.368 --> 03:25.455
- I'm Walter,
the class orphan.

03:25.538 --> 03:27.290
- This is Aaron,
my stepson.

03:27.373 --> 03:28.791
- Well, Aaron,
your stepmom and I

03:28.875 --> 03:30.460
used to go to
school together.

03:30.543 --> 03:33.922
Look how far we've come.
[laughing]

03:34.005 --> 03:35.173
- And look how far
Ben Franklin's come.

03:35.256 --> 03:38.551
Apparently, he's been
promoted to President.

03:38.635 --> 03:39.844
- You know what
I just realized?

03:39.928 --> 03:41.888
I left my lesson plan
in the teacher's lounge.

03:41.971 --> 03:42.597
I do that like...
[smacks forehead]

03:42.680 --> 03:46.100
all the time.
[laughing]

03:46.184 --> 03:49.187
- Ben Franklin?
Welcome with two Ls?

03:49.270 --> 03:50.480
She's still a doofus.

03:50.563 --> 03:52.774
Don't worry, Aaron,
I'm gonna fix this.

03:52.857 --> 03:55.735
- Hi, I'm Walter and I'm
all alone in the world.

04:00.031 --> 04:01.950
- Now, remember, joining
the right clique

04:02.033 --> 04:03.743
will set the tone for
the rest of high school.

04:03.826 --> 04:05.495
- And whatever we choose,
we stay together.

04:05.578 --> 04:08.998
Deal?
- Deal.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.124
- BOTH: Woo!

04:10.208 --> 04:12.627
- I know exactly
what we should do.

04:12.710 --> 04:13.670
A capella.
- Too perky.

04:13.753 --> 04:15.004
Let's go Goth.

04:15.088 --> 04:18.841
- I wanna join a clique,
not a coven.

04:18.925 --> 04:20.718
We're in this
to make friends.

04:20.802 --> 04:22.637
- Goths are very friendly.

04:22.720 --> 04:24.180
They do blood oaths.

04:24.263 --> 04:29.269
I don't wanna sing.
- I don't wanna bleed.

04:29.352 --> 04:30.353
How about theater?

04:30.436 --> 04:32.355
- Oh, you know
I can't memorize.

04:32.438 --> 04:33.648
Debate team?

04:33.731 --> 04:34.691
- You have to memorize
your arguments.

04:34.774 --> 04:38.611
- Unh-unh.
See? I'm learning.

04:38.695 --> 04:41.030
Okay, fine, uh...

04:41.114 --> 04:42.532
Drill team?
- I don't march.

04:42.615 --> 04:44.117
- Environmental club?
Newspaper?

04:44.200 --> 04:46.536
- I don't hug trees
and print media is dead.

04:46.619 --> 04:48.037
- Well, why don't
we just join

04:48.121 --> 04:51.541
the Gabby's-too-good-for-
everything club and do nothing?

04:51.624 --> 04:55.378
- Why don't you join
the shut up club and shut up?

04:55.461 --> 04:57.380
- Well, why don't
you just...

04:57.463 --> 05:00.091
[frustrated scream]

05:00.174 --> 05:03.219
- And you wanted to
join debate.

05:03.302 --> 05:05.680
Do you know what?
I'm gonna join a capella.

05:05.763 --> 05:07.682
- Fine, I'm gonna
join the Goths.

05:07.765 --> 05:09.100
- Fine, but don't
come to me

05:09.183 --> 05:11.686
when you need someone to sing
at your goat sacrifice.

05:11.769 --> 05:14.897
- You don't sing,
you chant.

05:14.981 --> 05:19.819
- Good golly,
Miss Molly.

05:19.902 --> 05:21.571
- Not now, James.

05:21.654 --> 05:26.409
- Okay. Later 'gator.

05:26.492 --> 05:27.493
- It's here!

05:27.577 --> 05:28.411
Look, it's here!
It's here!

05:28.494 --> 05:31.914
- I finally have
my very own...

05:31.998 --> 05:34.584
tourniquet
from the Civil War.

05:34.667 --> 05:38.046
It's stained.
That makes it worth more.

05:38.129 --> 05:42.008
- In that case, I have
good news about the couch.

05:42.091 --> 05:44.510
- Don't you get it?
This is living history.

05:44.594 --> 05:47.180
- Well, history
is killin' me.

05:47.263 --> 05:49.640
The first day of school,
Mr. Shank assigns me,

05:49.724 --> 05:53.269
and only me, an extra report
on World War II.

05:53.352 --> 05:55.021
- Really? Just you?

05:55.104 --> 05:57.190
Congratulations, buddy.
You're his project.

05:57.273 --> 05:59.776
- What is that and how
do I get out of it?

05:59.859 --> 06:01.069
- You can't.

06:01.152 --> 06:03.029
Every year, Shank picks
one slacker

06:03.112 --> 06:03.821
to turn into
the perfect student

06:03.905 --> 06:06.115
by crushing him
with extra work.

06:06.199 --> 06:08.659
Your life is gonna be
a total nightmare.

06:08.743 --> 06:11.120
This really is gonna
be my year.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.247
[laughing]

06:13.331 --> 06:14.707
- So, what did you do
to Mr. Shank

06:14.791 --> 06:17.001
to become his project?
- Nothing.

06:17.085 --> 06:20.379
He just started talking
about the Battle of the Bulge...

06:20.463 --> 06:23.716
and maybe I giggled.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.010
- James, those who don't
learn from history

06:26.094 --> 06:26.761
are doomed to repeat it...

06:26.844 --> 06:29.138
in summer school.

06:29.222 --> 06:31.808
- Mr. Shank said
the exact same thing.

06:31.891 --> 06:33.142
You guys should hang out.

06:33.226 --> 06:36.062
See who puts who
to sleep first.

06:36.145 --> 06:37.480
- I'll bet we'd stay
awake forever

06:37.563 --> 06:40.441
because history
is anything but boring.

06:40.525 --> 06:41.317
For instance,
the Battle of the Bulge

06:41.400 --> 06:45.905
was one of the biggest--
- [snickering]

06:49.158 --> 06:52.954
What? I'm 12.
It's gonna happen.

06:55.540 --> 06:59.168
- [knocks on door]
Sorry to barge in, Mrs.--

06:59.252 --> 07:00.670
Gosnold?

07:00.753 --> 07:04.590
- Oh, goody, a reunion.

07:04.674 --> 07:07.176
- Wait, you're
the principal now?

07:07.260 --> 07:08.594
What happened to
Mrs. Brannigan?

07:08.678 --> 07:09.929
- Well, she was
able to retire.

07:10.012 --> 07:13.516
I, on the other hand,
needed to keep my dental.

07:13.599 --> 07:15.685
- Hey, the new teeth
look totally real.

07:15.768 --> 07:16.853
And in my defense,
I did say, heads up.

07:16.936 --> 07:19.105
- [teeth click]

07:19.188 --> 07:23.109
Duck would have been
more helpful.

07:23.192 --> 07:25.278
Let me guess. You have
a problem with Aaron's teacher.

07:25.361 --> 07:26.195
- Well, I've heard
good things about

07:26.279 --> 07:28.698
the other fourth
grade teachers,

07:28.781 --> 07:29.740
and maybe Aaron could
get one of them.

07:29.824 --> 07:32.160
- Well, I've heard
good things

07:32.243 --> 07:33.202
about the other
fourth grade parents.

07:33.286 --> 07:37.206
Maybe Aaron could
get one of them.

07:37.290 --> 07:38.666
- Look, I don't wanna
be a problem mom.

07:38.749 --> 07:40.710
- [laughs]
Really?

07:40.793 --> 07:44.213
And you can stay that
to me with a straight face.

07:44.297 --> 07:45.715
- Okay, okay,
I'm the worst.

07:45.798 --> 07:47.842
Fine.

07:47.925 --> 07:50.219
I just want Aaron
transferred to another class.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.554
- Oh, that won't
be possible.

07:51.637 --> 07:54.223
The other fourth grade
teachers drew longer straws.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.434
- What? How do they
even know about me?

07:56.517 --> 07:57.560
- You might have been
the subject of

07:57.643 --> 08:00.938
our teachers' retreat.

08:03.941 --> 08:06.736
- Dad, meet my new favorite
teacher, Mr. Shank.

08:06.819 --> 08:08.196
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

08:08.279 --> 08:09.447
Sorry to intrude,
but James mentioned

08:09.530 --> 08:12.074
a Civil War collection
and I had to see it.

08:12.158 --> 08:15.703
- Two grown men with a mutual
interest in military history?

08:15.786 --> 08:18.748
Dare I say "Bromance"?

08:18.831 --> 08:20.208
- What are you up to?

08:20.291 --> 08:21.542
- I just figured you
could use someone

08:21.626 --> 08:24.253
to share your
hobbies of sadness.

08:24.337 --> 08:27.173
- Oh, look at you,
thinking of old dad.

08:27.256 --> 08:29.175
So, a fellow Civil War buff.

08:29.258 --> 08:30.760
Are you a collector,
as well, or just a fan?

08:30.843 --> 08:31.886
- Are you kidding?

08:31.969 --> 08:36.890
I happen to have a bone saw
from Antietam in my car.

08:36.974 --> 08:38.226
Do you wanna see it?

08:38.308 --> 08:41.270
- Did Robert E. Lee surrender
at Appomattox in 1865?

08:41.354 --> 08:44.607
- Was it on a postage
stamp in 1965?

08:44.690 --> 08:45.900
- Whoa! Ho! Ho!

08:51.864 --> 08:53.241
- Why are you so happy

08:53.324 --> 08:54.242
and what is Shank
doing in our house?

08:54.325 --> 08:57.245
- Because he's
Dad's new BFF.

08:57.328 --> 08:59.664
Which means I get
the family homework discount.

08:59.747 --> 09:01.624
- Yeah, that'll work.

09:01.707 --> 09:03.000
I have to go.
I have a capella practice.

09:03.084 --> 09:06.629
- Is Molly picking you up?
How much time do I have?

09:06.712 --> 09:08.881
My hair is a mess.

09:08.965 --> 09:10.800
- Get over her, James.

09:10.883 --> 09:12.593
Molly's not picking
me up for this

09:12.677 --> 09:13.386
or anything ever again.

09:13.469 --> 09:15.471
- You can't break
up with Molly.

09:15.554 --> 09:19.725
She's the only
good thing about you.

09:19.809 --> 09:21.894
- I would give anything
to try this bone saw

09:21.978 --> 09:23.229
out on a femur right now.

09:23.312 --> 09:25.106
- Ah, you're a doctor.
Can't you get your hands on one?

09:25.189 --> 09:27.233
- Well, I can't make
any promises,

09:27.316 --> 09:28.943
but I'll make
a few phone calls.

09:29.026 --> 09:30.569
- BOTH: [laughing]

09:30.653 --> 09:31.821
- You two have fun.

09:31.904 --> 09:33.531
I'll be upstairs playing
Puppets of Vengeance.

09:33.614 --> 09:37.660
- So, you finished that extra
report I assigned you?

09:37.743 --> 09:39.787
- I still have to do
that, even though

09:39.870 --> 09:42.331
you're having the time of
your life with my Dad?

09:42.415 --> 09:45.793
[snaps fingers]
What if I got you that femur?

09:45.876 --> 09:46.669
- Of course, you have
to do the report

09:46.752 --> 09:48.629
and if you get
your outline together,

09:48.713 --> 09:50.506
I can give you some
notes before I leave.

09:50.589 --> 09:51.841
- Well, if you have
to give him notes,

09:51.924 --> 09:52.800
maybe you'd like
to stay for dinner.

09:52.883 --> 09:54.927
- Was that an invitation?

09:55.011 --> 09:59.682
- Was the Gettysburg Address
elegant in its simplicity?

09:59.765 --> 10:02.310
- BOTH: Ah!
[laughing]

10:08.566 --> 10:09.775
- Aaron.

10:09.859 --> 10:11.110
Aa-ron!

10:11.193 --> 10:12.028
- Leave me alone.

10:12.111 --> 10:16.699
- No talking, please.

10:16.782 --> 10:18.242
- Just give this
note to Eric.

10:18.326 --> 10:20.453
- He already said
he doesn't like you.

10:20.536 --> 10:22.872
- It's not from me,
it's from Sasha.

10:22.955 --> 10:25.124
- Aaron, pass it.

10:25.207 --> 10:28.210
I like Sasha.

10:28.294 --> 10:30.379
- Dude, I told you no.

10:30.463 --> 10:33.007
The teacher said we have
to finish this before lunch.

10:33.090 --> 10:35.384
- Thank you.

10:35.468 --> 10:38.554
Okay, let's see what was more
important than long division.

10:38.637 --> 10:41.223
Oh, looks like Aaron
has a girlfriend.

10:41.307 --> 10:45.019
- KIDS: Oooohhhh...

10:45.102 --> 10:46.729
- That's not mine.

10:46.812 --> 10:48.814
- I do not allow
note passing.

10:48.898 --> 10:49.982
- I didn't do it.

10:50.066 --> 10:51.233
- Well, you can
explain that to me

10:51.317 --> 10:52.860
while you're standing
in the corner.

10:52.943 --> 10:53.944
- I said I didn't do
it, Miss Doofus.

10:54.028 --> 10:58.657
- KIDS: [gasping]

10:58.741 --> 11:00.659
- But I did do that.

11:04.330 --> 11:06.957
- I can't believe
I called my teacher doofus.

11:07.041 --> 11:08.709
I had to stand in the corner
for five whole minutes.

11:08.793 --> 11:11.253
- You think you've
got problems.

11:11.337 --> 11:12.797
Mr. Shank gave me
extra reading,

11:12.880 --> 11:15.758
so we can discuss it when
he comes over to see Dad.

11:15.841 --> 11:17.551
Did you know there are
three whole books

11:17.635 --> 11:19.011
just about World War II?

11:19.095 --> 11:21.847
- Three? Dad has
a shelf full of them.

11:21.931 --> 11:24.433
- What have I done?

11:24.517 --> 11:27.645
- Okay, next week is my first
a capella performance

11:27.728 --> 11:30.106
with Earth, Wind and Choir.
[laughing]

11:30.189 --> 11:33.234
Listen to this.
[clears throat]

11:33.317 --> 11:37.363
Ready?
Five, six, seven, eight...

11:37.446 --> 11:38.781
♪ Yah ♪

11:38.864 --> 11:40.908
[snaps fingers]
♪ Yah ♪

11:40.991 --> 11:43.619
♪ Yaaaah ♪

11:43.702 --> 11:46.914
- I'm sorry, I just
have one quick question.

11:46.997 --> 11:49.667
What the...?

11:49.750 --> 11:52.837
- See, you're not hearing the
whole group singing together.

11:52.920 --> 11:54.130
I'm just one part.

11:54.213 --> 11:56.757
- Is yours the part
of the dying sea cow?

11:56.841 --> 11:58.926
- Gabby, when
is this concert?

11:59.009 --> 12:02.263
Because I think
I have jury duty.

12:02.346 --> 12:04.974
- You guys have to hear
everybody sing together.

12:05.057 --> 12:06.475
I'm just the "Yahs."

12:06.559 --> 12:07.852
There's another
girl who's like...

12:07.935 --> 12:09.520
♪ Oh, yeah ♪

12:09.603 --> 12:11.105
And then a couple of
guys are like...

12:11.188 --> 12:12.773
♪ Bom bom bom bom
bom bom ♪

12:12.857 --> 12:16.819
And then this girl
Jackie gets all the words.

12:16.902 --> 12:17.653
- Do you know who
actually would be

12:17.736 --> 12:19.697
interested in
listening to this?

12:19.780 --> 12:21.740
Molly.
Why don't you call her?

12:21.824 --> 12:23.659
- I told you.
Molly and I broke up.

12:23.742 --> 12:24.994
We're not talking.

12:25.077 --> 12:25.953
- You don't have to talk.
Just listen to her breathe.

12:26.036 --> 12:29.832
That's what I do.

12:29.915 --> 12:32.960
I wish Dad and Mr. Shank
weren't talking.

12:33.043 --> 12:35.171
I need to break them up.

12:35.254 --> 12:36.714
Break them up like
the Munich Agreement

12:36.797 --> 12:39.341
broke up Czechoslovakia
in 1938.

12:39.425 --> 12:42.219
And why is this
in my brain?

12:42.303 --> 12:43.095
- So, there wasn't
any underwear

12:43.179 --> 12:46.056
in the laundry this week.

12:46.140 --> 12:48.225
Anybody wanna tell
me anything?

12:48.309 --> 12:52.438
- I do. I called
my teacher Miss Doofus.

12:52.521 --> 12:53.481
- Aaron!

12:53.564 --> 12:55.191
Do you think she knows
you got that from me?

12:55.274 --> 12:58.194
- Just how dumb
do you think she is?

12:58.277 --> 13:00.029
- Why would you say that?

13:00.112 --> 13:02.865
- Because you did--
in front of me.

13:02.948 --> 13:04.200
What were you thinking?

13:04.283 --> 13:05.534
My little brain just
soaks things up

13:05.618 --> 13:07.369
and I don't know when
they're gonna come out.

13:07.453 --> 13:10.331
James owns a piece
of a race horse.

13:13.959 --> 13:15.044
- Aaron, I am so sorry.

13:15.127 --> 13:16.712
But don't worry, this year
isn't ruined yet.

13:16.795 --> 13:20.049
We'll find a way to make things
right with Miss Doofus.

13:20.132 --> 13:23.928
- We should probably start
by not calling her Miss Doofus.

13:24.011 --> 13:25.888
- Excellent point.

13:25.971 --> 13:28.390
Plus, maybe
a "we're sorry" gift.

13:28.474 --> 13:30.476
Now how does a 12-year-old
buy a piece of a race horse?

13:30.559 --> 13:31.769
- Hey, I did something
for somebody,

13:31.852 --> 13:34.897
somebody did
something for me.

13:40.819 --> 13:41.612
- Uh, uh, uh, Charlie.

13:41.695 --> 13:42.905
Put your hands
in the air

13:42.988 --> 13:43.906
and step away from
the bakery boxes.

13:43.989 --> 13:46.116
Those are all
for my events.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.910
- But Les and I
are hungry.

13:47.993 --> 13:48.994
And, besides,
you've got all these.

13:49.078 --> 13:51.580
What about this one?

13:51.664 --> 13:54.583
Ah.
Hello?

13:54.667 --> 13:58.212
- It's for
a bachelorette party.

14:00.548 --> 14:01.465
- Good.

14:01.549 --> 14:02.925
'Cause that would be
a funny way of saying

14:03.008 --> 14:05.511
"It's a boy."
- STEPHANIE: [laughing]

14:06.679 --> 14:08.097
- MR. SHANK: At the
Jefferson Davis Museum

14:08.180 --> 14:10.182
of the Confederacy--
Oh, hey, buddy.

14:10.266 --> 14:12.393
I was just showing James
this musket ball

14:12.476 --> 14:14.853
from the Battle
of Chickamauga.

14:14.937 --> 14:16.063
It's very rare.
- Oh.

14:16.146 --> 14:18.107
- Not to brag.
Get it?

14:18.190 --> 14:20.109
Because the Confederate
commander was...

14:20.192 --> 14:23.821
- BOTH: Braxton Bragg!
[laughing]

14:23.904 --> 14:26.323
- You're right, Mr. Shank.

14:26.407 --> 14:28.701
Your collection is way
better than my Dad's.

14:28.784 --> 14:29.952
- I didn't say that.

14:30.035 --> 14:32.037
I said his is promising.

14:32.121 --> 14:33.956
- Promising? Ouch!

14:34.039 --> 14:36.458
I think we all
know what that means.

14:36.542 --> 14:38.586
Dinky!

14:38.669 --> 14:39.920
- Well, I think it's
a little more than dinky.

14:40.004 --> 14:42.256
It may not be extensive,

14:42.339 --> 14:43.507
but I have some
quality pieces.

14:43.591 --> 14:47.511
I believe my tourniquet
speaks for itself.

14:47.595 --> 14:48.929
- Yes, it does,
and it's saying

14:49.013 --> 14:53.017
Mr. Shank's collection
is a whole mess of cheap junk.

14:53.100 --> 14:54.476
- Cheap junk?

14:54.560 --> 14:55.978
I guess you wouldn't know
the difference,

14:56.061 --> 14:58.480
since you're still
a newbie.

14:58.564 --> 15:02.151
- Newbie?
That seems uncalled for.

15:02.234 --> 15:06.655
- Yes, I came late to collecting
tourniquets and saws,

15:06.739 --> 15:07.990
but that's because
I was busy using them

15:08.073 --> 15:10.659
to save peoples' lives.

15:12.911 --> 15:15.873
- Sounds like somebody's
putting down teachers

15:15.956 --> 15:17.666
for going home
at 3:00 o'clock

15:17.750 --> 15:20.753
and having
the whole summer off.

15:22.421 --> 15:24.173
- Teaching isn't important?

15:24.256 --> 15:25.132
How did you learn
to be a surgeon?

15:25.215 --> 15:27.176
Oh, right,
from a teacher.

15:27.259 --> 15:29.762
Boom!
You got Shanked.

15:29.845 --> 15:30.971
- Do you know what?

15:31.055 --> 15:32.598
I don't have to stand
here and take this.

15:32.681 --> 15:35.893
I am seceding from
this conversation, huh?

15:35.976 --> 15:38.687
- Ohhhhhhh!

15:38.771 --> 15:39.855
Yeah!

15:39.938 --> 15:41.899
Mr. Shank, if somebody
talked to me like that,

15:41.982 --> 15:44.610
I would storm outta here,

15:44.693 --> 15:47.196
hop into my...
What's that, a Civic?

15:47.279 --> 15:51.742
And keep going 'til
I hit the Mason-Dixon Line.

15:53.994 --> 15:55.537
- Abraham Lincoln said,

15:55.621 --> 15:57.581
"A house divided against
itself cannot stand,"

15:57.665 --> 16:00.542
and I, sir, cannot
stand your house.

16:00.626 --> 16:03.587
- You know what? I don't need
a collecting buddy like you!

16:03.671 --> 16:05.923
- Yeah!
- I have James!

16:06.006 --> 16:07.800
- No!

16:10.928 --> 16:13.847
- [blowing musical note]

16:13.931 --> 16:14.765
- Missing Molly, huh?

16:14.848 --> 16:19.228
- [blowing discordant notes]

16:19.311 --> 16:20.187
- Okay, don't
tell your Dad,

16:20.270 --> 16:22.648
but I am going
to sneak you

16:22.731 --> 16:24.900
one of my work cookies
to cheer you up.

16:24.983 --> 16:27.444
Wait a minute.
I'm missing a pink box.

16:27.528 --> 16:29.863
- Aaron took one to school
to butter up his teacher.

16:29.947 --> 16:32.366
- Please tell me it wasn't
the box on the bottom shelf.

16:32.449 --> 16:35.119
- He's little. He always takes
what's on the bottom.

16:35.202 --> 16:36.412
- No, no, no.

16:36.495 --> 16:37.371
They're not supposed to
learn about that cake

16:37.454 --> 16:40.749
until the eighth grade!

16:45.045 --> 16:48.257
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:48.340 --> 16:51.093
- I, uh, came by to collect
some of my things.

16:51.176 --> 16:53.762
How's a capella?

16:53.846 --> 16:55.723
- They made me the Yah-Yah
girl and I hate it.

16:55.806 --> 16:58.100
- And I hate being Goth.

16:58.183 --> 16:59.893
I know that's supposed to be
the point, but I still hate it.

16:59.977 --> 17:02.479
- Let's both quit and join
the watching cute boys club.

17:02.563 --> 17:05.107
- Oh, what's that?
- Just us watching cute boys.

17:05.190 --> 17:06.650
- I can do that. Sign me up.

17:06.733 --> 17:08.861
- [laughing] I saw three
of them two blocks down.

17:08.944 --> 17:10.154
- Oh, I call president.

17:10.237 --> 17:11.989
- Why do you get
to be president?

17:12.071 --> 17:13.240
- Because I just
like boys more.

17:13.323 --> 17:16.410
- Maybe because I like boys
more. Please.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.789
- Okay, everyone,
settle down.

17:20.873 --> 17:23.125
Please find your seats.

17:23.208 --> 17:25.627
Ooh, where did
this come from?

17:25.711 --> 17:27.212
- I brought it just
for you

17:27.296 --> 17:29.298
to say I'm sorry for
calling you that name.

17:29.381 --> 17:31.717
- Well, that is very sweet
of you, Aaron.

17:31.800 --> 17:33.302
Thank you.

17:33.385 --> 17:36.513
[gasps]
Where did you get this?

17:36.597 --> 17:39.641
- My stepmom.
It was her idea.

17:39.725 --> 17:40.976
- Okay, Stephanie told you
to give me this cake?

17:41.059 --> 17:45.147
- She wants you to know
what kind of mom she is.

17:45.230 --> 17:47.191
Let's dig in.

17:47.274 --> 17:49.526
- Don't dig in!

17:49.610 --> 17:51.153
There was a mix-up.
I need this for work.

17:51.236 --> 17:54.114
- What sort of work
do you do?

17:54.198 --> 17:56.158
- Stephanie, I'm trying
to make her like us.

17:56.241 --> 17:58.243
- This won't do it.
Gimme the box.

17:58.327 --> 17:59.787
- It's for Miss Dreyfus.

17:59.870 --> 18:01.121
- You never should
have taken it.

18:01.205 --> 18:03.373
- [cake splats]

18:03.457 --> 18:04.750
- STEPHANIE & DONNA:
[gasping]

18:04.833 --> 18:06.335
- Quick, step on
the present!

18:06.418 --> 18:09.838
- BOTH: [stomping]

18:09.922 --> 18:11.673
- The other teachers
are right.

18:11.757 --> 18:14.426
It is kinda funny when
it's not happening to you.

18:18.639 --> 18:21.225
- Donna, I am so sorry
about the cake,

18:21.308 --> 18:22.434
the nickname,
just all of it.

18:22.518 --> 18:26.855
- I just can't believe
you taught Aaron that nickname.

18:26.939 --> 18:30.400
I guess some of us haven't grown
up since the fourth grade.

18:30.484 --> 18:32.528
- Okay, I deserve that.

18:32.611 --> 18:34.780
But for what it's worth,
I did tell Aaron that name

18:34.863 --> 18:36.573
before I knew
you were his teacher.

18:36.657 --> 18:38.242
- But why would you say
that to any child?

18:38.325 --> 18:41.370
It was so mean.

18:41.453 --> 18:42.955
- Here's the thing.

18:43.038 --> 18:43.872
I'm a new mom.

18:43.956 --> 18:46.750
I'm still making
rookie mistakes.

18:46.834 --> 18:47.709
- [sighs]

18:47.793 --> 18:50.254
- Is there any way
we can bury the hatchet,

18:50.337 --> 18:53.590
start over, and give
Aaron a great year?

18:53.674 --> 18:55.843
- Sure.

18:55.926 --> 18:59.096
Just stay clear
of the bake sale.

18:59.179 --> 19:00.806
- Fair enough.

19:00.889 --> 19:01.265
So, are we good?

19:01.348 --> 19:03.559
- We're good.

19:03.642 --> 19:05.769
- BOTH: [laughing]

19:05.853 --> 19:07.187
- Uh, just real quick
before I go.

19:07.271 --> 19:10.816
Um, you do know that
Ben Franklin wasn't a President

19:10.899 --> 19:14.570
and that you don't
spell welcome with two Ls.

19:14.653 --> 19:16.488
- You still think
I'm a doofus.

19:16.572 --> 19:19.241
- Well, you did get left
back once or twice.

19:19.324 --> 19:20.617
- It was once and that
was only because

19:20.701 --> 19:22.119
they hadn't figured out
that I needed glasses.

19:22.202 --> 19:24.538
And as for the welcome
with two Ls

19:24.621 --> 19:27.916
and "President" Ben Franklin,
those are teaching tools.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.502
I deliberately put mistakes
around the classroom

19:30.586 --> 19:33.088
for the students to catch.
- Oh.

19:33.172 --> 19:38.427
Smart. Like the way you put
Grover Cleveland up there twice.

19:38.510 --> 19:40.596
- Oh, no, see, Cleveland
is up there twice

19:40.679 --> 19:45.267
because he was President
two separate times.

19:45.350 --> 19:47.519
- Please don't
flunk my kid.

19:53.317 --> 19:55.777
Hey, the Northerners
better win.

19:55.861 --> 19:57.613
- Don't worry,
it's a reenactment.

19:57.696 --> 19:59.531
They kinda make you
stick to the script.

19:59.615 --> 20:01.575
- Well, make sure you
take the hill by 1:30.

20:01.658 --> 20:03.660
I have a hair appointment.

20:03.744 --> 20:05.787
So, I take it you made
up with Mr. Shank.

20:05.871 --> 20:07.748
- A shared love of history

20:07.831 --> 20:10.918
is a bond not easily
torn asunder.

20:11.001 --> 20:11.960
- [laughing]

20:12.044 --> 20:13.670
- Besides, the battle
gives you free lunch,

20:13.754 --> 20:15.631
if you register
as a group of three.

20:15.714 --> 20:21.511
- Wait, you, Shank.
Who's your three?

20:21.595 --> 20:24.014
- [footsteps thudding
heavily]

20:27.184 --> 20:28.810
- [plays drum note]

20:31.438 --> 20:46.620
- ♪
