Excuse me?

00:55.000 --> 00:57.180

Cynthia Keener had a daughter named
Suzie who went missing in 1998.

04:06.220 --> 04:10.550
*****with her cell phone,her
wallet,her credit cards still inside.

04:10.560 --> 04:15.990
"to the victim found inside the vehicle
"led Phoenix police to conclude that MneHer

04:16.000 --> 04:19.010
was forcibly abducted from the scene."

04:19.019 --> 04:20.910
God.

04:24.250 --> 04:26.270
You're taking this pretty hard.

04:26.280 --> 04:29.370
I work with this woman practically
every da dn't even know she was a mother,

04:29.380 --> 04:32.010
let alone a victim
of a horrible tragedy.

04:32.020 --> 04:33.820
I can't believe she anything.

04:33.830 --> 04:37.140
that you bring up in
casual conversation.

04:37.150 --> 04:39.240
My conversations with her aren't casual.

04:39.250 --> 04:40.970
I help her find missing people.

04:40.980 --> 04:42.520
Her daughter is a missing person.

04:42.530 --> 04:46.400
You'd think that would com I'm
supposed tet wh hein less than an h

04:46.410 --> 04:48.010
What the hell do I say to her?

04:48.330 --> 04:50.170
Why... why are you
going to say anything?

04:50.180 --> 04:53.200
I methis is clearly something
that't want to talk about.

04:53.210 --> 04:55.810
I dreamt it for a reason,for a purpose.

04:55.820 --> 05:00.560
is to open up Cynthia Keener's
year and pour salt in it.

05:00.570 --> 05:01.740
Of course not. But.

05:01.750 --> 05:03.960
I don't think there's a "but" here.

05:03.970 --> 05:07.970
It seems to me that everything you saw
is right there in that news article.

05:07.980 --> 05:11.500
Did you see the kidnapper's face or his.

05:11.510 --> 05:14.400
- No.
- I don't know.

05:14.590 --> 05:19.720
Maybe the universe just wants you to
know at tWitch isn't so wicked after all.

05:21.320 --> 05:24.970
Melanie Louise Linder,age 18.

05:24.980 --> 05:28.500
Lives with her parents
Marjorie and Clarence Linder.

05:28.840 --> 05:32.630
Hasn't called home in 72 hours.

05:34.780 --> 05:37.470
Did you get to the
she's done this before?

05:37.480 --> 05:40.910
Yeah. Ran off to Baja with her
friends for two wee she was 16.

05:40.920 --> 05:45.820
that she used her ATM card

05:45.830 --> 05:49.180
that cost about as muc
e in the last quarter,

05:49.190 --> 05:51.070
leads me to believe that

05:51.080 --> 05:57.750
young Melanie decided to
at to escape her ovotects.

05:59.360 --> 06:02.010
Still,her mother must be devastated.

06:02.020 --> 06:04.860
They usually are.

06:06.630 --> 06:12.120
I know you don't normally dream
aboung girls on shopping sprees,

06:12.790 --> 06:14.690
but I'd like you to listen to these.

06:14.700 --> 06:15.880
What are these?

06:15.920 --> 06:18.990
They're some interviews I
did with Melanie's friends.

06:19.000 --> 06:24.190
I'd like you to listen to them and tell
me whether you get a feeling or whatever,

06:24.680 --> 06:29.000
********

06:32.200 --> 06:33.470
What's wrong

06:33.480 --> 06:35.250
Nothing. I...

06:35.260 --> 06:37.930
I just feel bad for her mother.

06:38.900 --> 06:41.770
Not knowing be

06:44.170 --> 06:50.540
Yobe a how much the human
constitution can withstand,Allison.

06:52.570 --> 06:55.690
I just wanted to,I don't
know,give her a hug.

06:55.700 --> 07:00.590
It's amazing how finding out this one new
thing about her makes the rest of it make sense.

07:00.600 --> 07:02.340
I don't know what I
would do if I were her.

07:02.350 --> 07:03.750
Well,**

07:03.760 --> 07:08.840
Instead,you are someone who's going to
figure out how to make this meal edible.

07:08.850 --> 07:10.850
I'm an engineer. You're a psychic.

07:10.860 --> 07:13.680
Why can't we follow this recipe?

07:13.690 --> 07:15.400
GETTE: This is stupid!

07:15.410 --> 07:17.240
What you got there,Bridge?
What's stupid?

07:17.250 --> 07:19.880
Science. Science is stupid.

07:19.890 --> 07:22.630
That's a pretty bold statement.
What's all this about?

07:22.640 --> 07:27.770
We're supposed to take this stupid solar
cell,make it turn on this light bulb.

07:27.780 --> 07:30.820
olar cells are not stupid.

07:30.830 --> 07:36.690
Th becomnergand then the energy
turns on the Christmas tree light.

07:36.700 --> 07:40.160
But th stuIf it's sunny
outside,what's the pointng on a light b

07:40.170 --> 07:42.330
Shgota point there

07:42.340 --> 07:47.690
The point is toze yourself with other ways to
energize things an plugging them into a wall socket.

07:47.700 --> 07:49.260
But why a light bulb?

07:49.270 --> 07:50.780
Well,it doe have be a light b

07:50.790 --> 07:53.280
You're right.Ituldnbe a light b at mb e

Middle of nowhere,as far as I can tell.

09:10.310 --> 09:15.090
The last girl tried
screaming,but no one hears.

09:15.100 --> 09:16.910
No one but him.

09:16.920 --> 09:18.600
The last girl?

09:18.610 --> 09:22.060
It seems like there's always two of us.

09:22.080 --> 09:26.050
One of us out he one in there.

09:26.060 --> 09:31.220

11:10.930 --> 11:17.090
or a forms of employment outside of
your current field or specialization?

11:17.100 --> 11:23.720
I would thatged one the above le second
of every single day just like last month.

11:23.730 --> 11:27.490
And have you turned down any
offers of employment in tnth?

11:27.500 --> 11:31.390
No,I haven't torn up
any ing ckets either.

11:31.400 --> 11:33.040
d boch of money from my mother,though.

11:33.050 --> 11:35.000
at was particularly pleasant.

11:35.010 --> 11:37.030

m with that,does it?

11:37.040 --> 11:40.180
Man humiliating himself by
asking his mother for money?

11:40.190 --> 11:42.170

11:42.180 --> 11:43.980
Sorry,yere Go ahead.

11:43.990 --> 11:46.460
Ask me the next one. The

That's my favorite. That's
the one I look forward to.

We have to ask theuest Mr. Dubois,in
the event that answactually chang

11:54.290 --> 11:58.670
Isn't that the definition of crazy,doing the same thing over
and over again with the expectation of a different result?

11:58.680 --> 12:02.200
Could I not say the
same thing back to you?

12:03.810 --> 12:06.940
Mr. Dubois,you're a highly educated man.

12:06.950 --> 12:09.980
he things you're doing
to find employment king.

12:09.990 --> 12:14.760
are only two companies in Phoenix
that do work in your field,

12:14.770 --> 12:18.310
and that in the near term,neither
one is going to hire you.

12:18.700 --> 12:23.240
Why are you waiting for someone to
give you permission to earn a living?

12:23.250 --> 12:25.680
I beg your pardon?

12:29.250 --> 12:30.290

12:43.110 --> 12:46.130
You might need a couple more of these.

12:46.140 --> 12:47.820
But I don't have any more.

12:47.830 --> 12:49.480
Maybe if you...

12:49.490 --> 12:51.340
if we ask your teacher for more.

12:51.350 --> 12:55.140
Bu tea we can only use what
she gave us for the project.

Well,maybe if we talked to her.

16:08.740 --> 16:11.430
You want to hear somey?

16:11.440 --> 16:14.560
What if we're already dead?

16:16.150 --> 16:21.100
What if this is death
and someonst f to tell us?

16:29.770 --> 16:31.730
What?

16:31.740 --> 16:33.230
- What?
- Listen.

16:34.620 --> 16:37.230
Do you hear that?

16:39.100 --> 16:42.020
- 's got the TV on or a radio.
- No,no.

16:42.030 --> 16:44.700
No,I know what that is. That's...

16:45.490 --> 16:47.660
that's St. John the Divine.

16:47.670 --> 16:48.930
What do you mean,the apostle?

16:48.940 --> 16:50.780
No,the church.

16:50.790 --> 16:53.580
It's two blocks from my house.

16:53.590 --> 16:56.320
I've heard them ring
every day of my life.

16:56.330 --> 16:58.700
ust be within blocks of my house.

16:58.710 --> 16:59.690
Are you sure?

16:59.700 --> 17:02.750
Every day of my life.

17:03.210 --> 17:04.630
You're right.

17:04.640 --> 17:06.260
a die. No way.

17:06.270 --> 17:11.569
****Not if I'm this close to home.

17:12.599 --> 17:15.619
t if I'm this close to my mom.

17:23.430 --> 17:25.579
Allison?

17:25.980 --> 17:28.500
Why didn't you say something?

17:28.510 --> 17:32.140
I never say anything to anyone.

17:33.250 --> 17:35.630
It's mine.

17:35.640 --> 17:38.360
I own it.

17:41.530 --> 17:46.020
's tnowior w...

17:46.810 --> 17:49.840
who did it...

17:49.850 --> 17:52.480
what they did.

17:53.900 --> 17:56.260
******

17:56.270 --> 18:01.370
*********

18:04.980 --> 18:08.910
Sometimes I think it's
God laughing at me.

18:09.680 --> 18:14.350
I think I ere he took
h e he k and the others.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.140
The others?

18:16.150 --> 18:18.280
There was at least one other.

18:18.290 --> 18:20.740
Her name was Johanna.

18:20.750 --> 18:22.250
my G

18:22.260 --> 18:27.170
I believe with a little bit of legwork,we
can figure out where he kept them.

18:27.750 --> 18:31.190
something your daughter said.

18:31.200 --> 18:34.180
She heard church bells.

18:34.190 --> 18:35.110
It was underground,

18:35.120 --> 18:37.960
but it wasn't a basement or
it wasn't just a basement.

18:37.970 --> 18:43.200
And it looked like it was set up
like some kind of a fallout shelter,

18:43.930 --> 18:48.080
which makes sens 'cause we
don'allyavesements here in P

18:48.090 --> 18:51.480
I still don't understand
how that telanyt

18:51.490 --> 18:55.230
Well,I was hoping that we could
go down to City Hall,save records,

18:55.240 --> 19:00.380
permits and *******

19:00.390 --> 19:05.940
if we make a list of all the addresses
that are half a awafrom that churc

19:08.140 --> 19:10.280
*******

19:10.290 --> 19:14.620
to come to Phoenix.

19:14.740 --> 19:18.630
I look for some reason,some...

19:18.930 --> 19:24.490
unsolved case that I can attach myself
to without expending too much effort.

19:26.060 --> 19:31.700
excuse I can give compy here

19:32.340 --> 19:35.760
I keep thinking I'm
gonna find something,

19:36.100 --> 19:40.620
some clue,some stone
nobody's turned over.

19:42.730 --> 19:47.160
every year,I leave with nothing.

19:49.800 --> 19:51.940
Until now.

19:52.760 --> 19:54.250
415 Natchez.

19:54.260 --> 19:57.510
Well,it's the last address on our list.

20:00.470 --> 20:02.990
*********

20:09.790 --> 20:11.570
How long have you lived here,Ms

20:12.250 --> 20:13.940
Um,six years.

20:13.950 --> 20:18.600
******

20:18.610 --> 20:24.410
He talks about making this a
game room f those home theaters,

20:24.420 --> 20:29.860
but the grandkids have pretty
mucfor when they're here.

20:29.870 --> 20:34.320
What about before
you,say,eight or nine years ago?

20:34.330 --> 20:36.880
Do you have aneaved here then?

20:36.890 --> 20:39.040
No,I'm sorry.

20:39.050 --> 20:41.840
*********

20:41.850 --> 20:46.190
He rented it out,which is why it was
in such bad shape when we bought it.

20:46.560 --> 20:47.840
Nice man.

20:47.850 --> 20:50.390
Passed away June before last.

20:50.400 --> 20:53.030
Uh,I need to grab that.

21:08.290 --> 21:11.530
This is the place.

21:32.600 --> 21:34.800
Tell me everything.

21:47.720 --> 21:50.130
They kept them...

21:51.810 --> 21:55.100
shackled to the wall over here...

21:55.110 --> 21:58.890
with just enough chain so
that they could reach the...

21:58.900 --> 22:01.740
the wash basin here.

22:06.780 --> 22:08.870
And here.

22:12.760 --> 22:15.290
This is where first kept her...

22:20.620 --> 22:23.070
bound and gagged.

22:39.330 --> 22:40.960
**********

22:49.620 --> 22:52.820
She was here the whole time.

23:08.710 --> 23:11.670
st six b.

23:22.730 --> 23:24.010
Here's where you can reach me,

23:24.020 --> 23:26.550
um,if you do fi numfor the former

23:26.560 --> 23:28.830
Oh,fin I've got it here somewhere.

23:29.480 --> 23:30.690
Thanks.

23:57.930 --> 24:00.820
Hi,Mom. What's going on?

24:00.830 --> 24:02.860
What's all this for?

24:02.870 --> 24:04.870
For me.

24:04.880 --> 24:06.680
Where is everybody?

24:06.690 --> 24:09.920
Follow the obnoxiously loud music.

24:29.670 --> 24:31.870
It's all about the mirrors.

24:32.130 --> 24:37.510
that your father rented
to back in, uh, June 1988.

24:37.520 --> 24:41.560
Weuh, ld call me with any
information or-or fax me,

24:41.570 --> 24:42.820
that w beally great.

24:42.830 --> 24:44.210
I hope to hearfrom you.

24:44.220 --> 24:46.990
I keep waiting for it to
fail,but it just won't fail.

24:47.010 --> 24:49.610
I'm sorry. The topic of
the conversation is what?

24:49.620 --> 24:52.080
My little solar-cell amplifion

24:52.090 --> 24:55.560
I just hooked it upto the garage
door clicker,and it worked.

24:55.570 --> 24:59.200
It powered that, too.

24:59.210 --> 25:00.920
Excellent, Mr. Edison.

25:00.930 --> 25:05.200
A clock radio that only works un
is t or you shine a lamp on it.

25:05.570 --> 25:07.060
Hey, just 'cause your world isn't sunny,

25:07.070 --> 25:10.320
that doesn't mean you
get to rain all over mine.

25:10.330 --> 25:11.680
I'm sorry I wasn't listening.

25:11.690 --> 25:15.180
I was watching the clock radio stop
working whenyou click the light off.

25:17.640 --> 25:20.460
You're in a dark place,aren't you?

25:20.470 --> 25:22.240
I still have my pi y decorations.

25:22.250 --> 25:24.010
You want to borrow some?

25:43.080 --> 25:45.340
Do you have any idea how to do this?

25:45.960 --> 25:49.500
God,no.

25:50.010 --> 25:51.460
Where did you get that?

25:51.470 --> 25:54.010
I saw it upstairs,and I...

25:54.940 --> 25:56.900
You know.

25:57.320 --> 25:59.850
I thought maybe I could use it...

25:59.860 --> 26:03.940
to pick the lock or...

26:06.650 --> 26:09.500
But I don't know what I'm doing.

26:14.950 --> 26:17.020
Do you think your mom
might really find us?

26:17.040 --> 26:18.830
She's an investigator.

26:18.840 --> 26:21.400
ally good at this stuff.

26:21.410 --> 26:23.700
nice.

26:23.860 --> 26:26.140
Itt beeling.

26:26.910 --> 26:29.050
I'm sure your mom is
worried about you,too.

26:29.060 --> 26:31.530
I'm sure she's out there looking.

26:32.280 --> 26:34.330
My mom?

26:34.910 --> 26:36.760
My mom is...

26:36.770 --> 26:39.210
home right now and...

26:39.220 --> 26:42.000
knitting me a sweater.

26:42.010 --> 26:43.450
What are you talking about?

26:43.460 --> 26:45.580
Nothing.

26:47.130 --> 26:53.830
momto knit. She's.he'sitting.

26:55.010 --> 26:59.750
Yeah,she even opened a yarn
store in Buxley,two towns over.

27:01.270 --> 27:03.190
Any minute now,she's gonna...

27:03.200 --> 27:08.870
burst in the door with a knitting needle and
threaten to stab our host in the heart with it.

27:56.610 --> 28:02.020
No. No,no,no,no,no,no!

28:04.340 --> 28:05.870
Get off her!

28:10.510 --> 28:15.350
No! Don't! Let her
go!Let her go!Let her go!

28:15.360 --> 28:19.390
Stop! Don't you...Oh,my
God...Stop it,please!

28:19.400 --> 28:22.830
No! Stop!

28:35.330 --> 28:36.850
Well,I went down to police headquarters.

28:36.860 --> 28:39.380
lookthe mug books all
the way back to '95.

28:39.390 --> 28:40.920
dn't see his picture.

28:40.930 --> 28:43.770
But I have his face burned in my memory.

28:43.780 --> 28:47.780
So this is the man you
saw kill this girl Johanna?

28:48.490 --> 28:51.910
The same girl who-who was
trying to help my daughter?

28:51.920 --> 28:55.690
She d in Or her mother lived in Buxley.

28:55.700 --> 28:59.110
At least she owned a shop
there,a yarn store or something.

29:00.820 --> 29:03.220
me to The Complicated Yarn.

29:03.230 --> 29:04.470
What can I do for you?

29:04.480 --> 29:06.100
CYNTHIA: Marion Wheeler?

29:06.110 --> 29:08.320
Are you the owner of this store?

29:08.330 --> 29:10.370
**

29:10.380 --> 29:13.380
Actually,we're here to talk to you
about your daughter,Mrs. Wheeler.

29:13.390 --> 29:14.670
Okay.

29:14.680 --> 29:16.350
Again,who-who are you?

29:16.360 --> 29:19.750
We're investigators working
on a missing persons case,

29:19.760 --> 29:24.170
anthat happened nine years
ago. aughter's name came up.

29:24.180 --> 29:25.630
I don't understand.

29:25.640 --> 29:27.030
Johanna.

29:27.040 --> 29:29.740
We're talking about Johanna.

29:30.280 --> 29:32.450
We think we know what
might have happened to her.

29:32.460 --> 29:33.740
M-My Johanna?

29:33.750 --> 29:38.970
We thought yight filed
a police report,...

29:39.860 --> 29:42.830
I have...

29:42.840 --> 29:45.890
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

29:45.900 --> 29:47.220
Johanna.

29:47.230 --> 29:48.910
Her disappearance.

29:48.920 --> 29:51.420
In 1998.

29:51.830 --> 29:53.450
Okay,I'm sorry. There's...

29:53.460 --> 29:57.430
Th-there's obviously someriblhere.

29:57.830 --> 30:00.350
My dn't missing. She's
never been missing.

30:00.360 --> 30:01.620
She never disappeared.

30:01.630 --> 30:04.970
I mean,I was with her
yesterday here,and...

30:04.980 --> 30:07.230
and-and I spoke to her
this morning. She's...

30:07.240 --> 30:08.910
she's fine.

30:08.920 --> 30:10.740
She's fine?

30:10.750 --> 30:12.820
Uh,par-pardon me. Forgive me.

30:12.830 --> 30:15.610
Do you have a picture of her?
If I could just look at her...

30:15.620 --> 30:17.710
Uh,yes,I-right over here.

30:17.720 --> 30:22.110
We took a trip to ndogether a couple

30:29.320 --> 30:31.500
Oh,my goodness,that's her.

30:31.510 --> 30:32.980
That's... that's who?

30:32.990 --> 30:35.680
Thatdaughter. That's my Johanna.

30:36.010 --> 30:37.960
And-and really,for
the life of me,I c...

30:37.970 --> 30:40.370
I cannot figure out what
you people want with her.

30:40.380 --> 30:46.470
Um,yo rigMr. We've obviously made
some sort of horrible mistake.

30:46.480 --> 30:48.390
But she exists.

30:48.400 --> 30:50.640
The fallout shelter exists.

30:50.660 --> 30:52.250
It must mean something.

30:52.260 --> 30:53.710
It means you're wrong.

30:53.720 --> 30:55.100
It means I'm actually...

30:55.110 --> 30:58.060
I'm actually angry that
that woman's daughter isn'

30:58.070 --> 31:00.460
because she couldn't have been
there for my daughterinal moments

31:00.470 --> 31:03.180
if,in fact,she was ever
even in that basement.

31:03.190 --> 31:04.520
Cynthia!

31:04.530 --> 31:07.540
I think we've come to the of Allison.

31:07.550 --> 31:08.600
What does that mean?

31:08.610 --> 31:10.280
It means...

31:10.290 --> 31:12.600
I don't want to have anything
further to do with you.

31:12.610 --> 31:14.940
I no longer want any
association with you.

31:14.950 --> 31:16.320
ns you're fired!

31:16.330 --> 31:18.590
Where can I drop you off?

32:34.950 --> 32:40.170
INSPIRATION

32:54.660 --> 32:55.700
Uh,I don't understand.

32:55.710 --> 32:57.690
We're talking about Ariel's old toy?

32:57.700 --> 32:59.220
Here's the thing: it isn't just a toy.

32:59.230 --> 33:02.340
I actually think that
it might havel-woations.

33:02.350 --> 33:05.860
I mean,there are problems on top of problems
but if I could lick even just a few of them...

33:05.870 --> 33:06.820
Wait,slow down.

33:06.830 --> 33:08.410
Are you telling me you think you...

33:08.920 --> 33:10.560
you actually invented something?

33:10.570 --> 33:14.110
I've a lot of things.

33:14.120 --> 33:17.130
This... this would be
mine.This could be ours.

33:17.140 --> 33:22.400
I mean,think about it: own *****

33:22.800 --> 33:25.960
I mean,I'm actually starting to
think that everyg thhappened wit that

33:25.970 --> 33:31.080
it was supposed to happen so that I
could be t this idea,have this new future.

33:31.090 --> 33:33.960
I don't understand. w
dork?What do we do next?

33:33.970 --> 33:38.700
We just put gnoutside the
house,"solar-cell amplifiers for sale"?

33:38.710 --> 33:42.060
Well,that's what I've been trying to
figure out since 3:00 in the morning.

33:42.070 --> 33:46.150
First thing I got to do is file a bunch
of legal papers,patents and things.

33:46.160 --> 33:52.300
Then I got to get a working model built,ybe
pay for some testing,some studies s

33:52.310 --> 33:55.780
o that I can show people
that it acly dwhat I say it

33:55.790 --> 33:59.740
And then the key to thing

33:59.750 --> 34:01.870
Wait a second.Wait a second

34:02.460 --> 34:06.340
All that sounds expensive.

34:06.350 --> 34:08.380
Well,that's why you meet
with the venture capitalists:

34:08.389 --> 34:09.920
to get the money to start the business.

34:09.929 --> 34:11.040
Yeah,but...

34:11.060 --> 34:14.300
all the stuff before that
all the stuff foreit to them--

34:14.320 --> 34:17.449
the lawyers and the
model and the studies.

34:17.460 --> 34:21.060
Yeah,I figure all that's
gonna cost about 30,000.

34:21.570 --> 34:24.179
Joe,come on.

34:24.190 --> 34:27.460
$30,000? We don't even have $3,000.
