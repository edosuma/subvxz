You left us exposed
for two days?

14:22.696 --> 14:24.114
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

14:24.198 --> 14:26.074
I was afraid, Kai.

14:26.366 --> 14:27.993
Afraid of what?

14:29.328 --> 14:31.038
Afraid of what, Ally?

14:31.121 --> 14:33.999
I was afraid what happened
would break your heart.

14:41.840 --> 14:44.343
Please, you can't tell Kai.

14:44.635 --> 14:46.386
Who the hell are you?

14:47.054 --> 14:48.597
Are you a cop?

14:48.680 --> 14:50.265
-(COUGHING) No.
-You FBI?

14:50.349 --> 14:52.935
No. No, I do data processing
for a hospital.

14:53.018 --> 14:54.978
The cops busted me
heading to a rave

14:55.103 --> 14:57.064
with 120 ecstasy pills
in my bag.

14:57.147 --> 14:59.483
They were gonna lock me up
for five years.

14:59.816 --> 15:02.236
They knew Samuels was dirty.

15:02.528 --> 15:05.572
They told me
if I could infiltrate the gang

15:05.656 --> 15:09.159
and get information on him,
they'd drop all the charges.

15:09.243 --> 15:11.828
But they had no idea,
no clue about Kai

15:11.912 --> 15:14.164
and all the crazy cult shit
we've been up to.

15:14.248 --> 15:18.377
Once they did, they made me
stay in and get more.

15:21.547 --> 15:23.966
So you're just working
for the state police?

15:25.259 --> 15:27.010
Isn't that enough?

15:27.094 --> 15:28.846
He's gonna kill me.

15:28.929 --> 15:32.182
Look what he just did
to his goddamn sister!

15:32.266 --> 15:34.226
Are the cops listening in on us
right now?

15:34.309 --> 15:35.769
Can you call for help?

15:36.103 --> 15:37.938
No, it doesn't work like that.

No, Kai.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.962
Your sister never betrayed you.

16:02.045 --> 16:05.090
It was Speedwagon all this time.

16:06.133 --> 16:08.010

21:26.453 --> 21:28.705
can I take a picture with you?

you had to go through,

21:30.582 --> 21:32.376

the other shoe to drop.

then let me go.

of angry white nationalists?

22:43.405 --> 22:45.115

an unwilling victim.

22:45.199 --> 22:46.575
You were the informant.

22:46.658 --> 22:48.202
Is that what you told them?

22:48.285 --> 22:50.078
I told them the truth.

22:50.871 --> 22:54.082
I didn't see that you were
involved in any crime,

22:55.125 --> 22:56.919
except being subservient

22:57.002 --> 22:59.713
to those misogynistic assholes.

23:00.214 --> 23:01.757

23:01.840 --> 23:04.051
what Kai did or didn't do.

23:04.134 --> 23:06.011
The DA offered a plea.

23:07.721 --> 23:11.308
He waives a trial to save himself
from the death penalty.

23:12.100 --> 23:14.561

he couldn't bear to have

23:14.645 --> 23:15.938

23:16.021 --> 23:17.981
You got to admit
it's driving you crazy,

to turn on you.

out smelling like a rose?

23:29.493 --> 23:31.870
<i>when Vincent put me</i>
<i>in the psychiatric ward.</i>

23:31.954 --> 23:34.248
<i>They had their suspicions</i>
<i>about Kai back then,</i>

23:34.331 --> 23:36.041
<i>after the assassination attempt.</i>

23:36.124 --> 23:38.043
BEVERLY: <i>And that's when</i>
<i>you joined the cult.</i>

23:38.126 --> 23:41.338
I became invaluable to the FBI,

23:41.421 --> 23:43.549
and in return,
I got immunity.

23:44.883 --> 23:46.343
Damn, Ally.

23:46.426 --> 23:48.428
You're the one
they all should be afraid of.

23:48.512 --> 23:49.721
Ha!

23:49.805 --> 23:51.473
Of all the pain you endured,

23:52.182 --> 23:56.478
I'm sure watching Kai kill Ivy
right in front of you

23:56.562 --> 23:58.939
must have been
the most difficult.

24:01.733 --> 24:03.485
It was.

24:05.779 --> 24:08.782
I couldn't process it
for a long time.

24:09.283 --> 24:12.369
Obviously, I still haven't.

24:13.537 --> 24:16.123
Her last words to me were:

24:16.206 --> 24:17.457
"I love you.

24:17.541 --> 24:19.251
"I'm sorry.

24:20.669 --> 24:22.671
"Protect our son."

24:25.299 --> 24:26.758
So I did.

24:27.759 --> 24:30.429
You do know that Kai took credit

24:30.512 --> 24:32.681
for every murder

24:32.764 --> 24:34.850
except Ivy's.

24:34.933 --> 24:37.227
He says you did that.

24:37.311 --> 24:40.564
For revenge
for all that she had taken from you.

24:40.647 --> 24:42.816
Yeah, I-I think I read that...

24:42.900 --> 24:44.735
in <i>The New York Times.</i>

24:44.818 --> 24:46.612
It's absurd, right?

24:47.821 --> 24:50.324
Yes. Absurd.

24:51.783 --> 24:53.827
I joined his cult to save Oz,

24:53.911 --> 24:56.330
to <i>save </i>Ivy.

24:58.916 --> 25:00.959
But I couldn't save them both.

25:03.420 --> 25:05.422
I could only save one.

25:08.008 --> 25:09.259
I believe you.

25:09.343 --> 25:11.053
(EXHALES) Thank you.

25:13.347 --> 25:14.890
I know a lot of women, though,

25:14.973 --> 25:17.434
who would kill their spouse

25:17.518 --> 25:21.230
if they were that betrayed,
that humiliated.

25:22.147 --> 25:24.233
And I bet every woman
in the world

25:24.316 --> 25:26.568
would understand that reaction.

25:33.242 --> 25:35.494
How have you been holding up?

25:38.997 --> 25:41.124
I went from a TV news reporter

25:41.208 --> 25:43.210
to tending bar
at The Flaming Lips.

39:09.266 --> 39:10.851
If I'm being honest,

39:11.393 --> 39:14.897
all that Divine Ruler shit
really turns me off.

39:22.029 --> 39:23.864
KAI: Don't just stand there
and stare at me.

39:23.947 --> 39:25.324
Say something.

39:27.868 --> 39:29.870
Say something!

39:33.916 --> 39:35.292
You were wrong.

39:36.877 --> 39:40.005
There is something more
dangerous in this world

39:40.088 --> 39:41.924
than a humiliated man:

39:42.966 --> 39:44.718
a nasty woman.

39:46.720 --> 39:48.222
(SCREAMING)

39:54.228 --> 39:56.021
REPORTER: <i>The polls</i>
<i>have closed in Michigan</i>

39:56.104 --> 39:59.525
and with just 6% of precincts reporting,

39:59.608 --> 40:03.070
we can project that underdog,
Allyson Mayfair-Richards,

40:03.153 --> 40:06.031
has unseated incumbent
Herbert Jackson,

40:06.114 --> 40:09.201
sealing her place
as Michigan's next senator.

40:09.284 --> 40:11.578
Exit polls indicate
Ms. Richards will win

40:11.662 --> 40:14.498
an astounding 80%
of the female vote.

40:15.415 --> 40:17.501
-Tickle, tickle, tickle!
-(OZ GIGGLES)

40:17.584 --> 40:19.253
Okay, you need to go to sleep.

40:19.336 --> 40:20.671
Come on.

40:21.171 --> 40:23.465
All righty, here's your elephant.

40:26.051 --> 40:27.177
What is it?

40:27.553 --> 40:28.720
You won.

40:28.804 --> 40:30.013
Yes, I did.

40:30.222 --> 40:31.598
We did.

40:35.686 --> 40:38.146
Does this mean
you're in charge now?

40:38.230 --> 40:40.023
Well, I'm in charge of you.

40:40.107 --> 40:41.733
(LAUGHING)

40:44.903 --> 40:46.405
Of your constituents?

40:47.030 --> 40:48.282
Wow.

40:49.658 --> 40:50.951
There's a big word.

40:51.034 --> 40:52.578
Someone's been paying attention.

40:57.499 --> 41:00.836
In our system, elected officials
work for the people.

41:02.087 --> 41:03.630
Mmm...

41:03.714 --> 41:05.841
so you get to boss them around?

41:06.675 --> 41:08.594
Well, more like lead them.

41:10.179 --> 41:11.847
Help show them the way.

41:12.890 --> 41:14.641
Take them to a better place.

41:15.058 --> 41:16.602
A better world.

41:18.312 --> 41:20.647
I want that for you, Oz.

41:21.231 --> 41:23.609
A world where
you can be a better man

41:23.692 --> 41:25.861
than the ones
who came before you.

41:26.278 --> 41:27.946
I will be.

41:28.530 --> 41:30.115
I hope so, honey.

41:41.543 --> 41:42.669
You want this guy?

41:48.050 --> 41:50.219
I need you to go back to sleep, okay?

41:50.302 --> 41:52.221
And Erika's here
if you need anything.

41:52.346 --> 41:54.640
-Where are you going?
-Mama has a meeting.

41:55.182 --> 41:57.518
Some very special,
very powerful friends

41:57.601 --> 41:59.102
who are gonna help bring about

41:59.186 --> 42:02.022
that better world
that we were talking about.

42:02.105 --> 42:03.899
What kind of friends?

42:04.483 --> 42:07.236
Political people, like Kai?

42:07.819 --> 42:08.946
No, honey.

42:10.072 --> 42:11.740
Not like Kai.

42:12.449 --> 42:14.535
Never again like Kai.

42:18.205 --> 42:19.748
Women.

42:20.290 --> 42:23.669
A group of powerful,
empowered women

42:24.253 --> 42:26.129
who want to change the system.

42:32.010 --> 42:33.554
Okay, close your eyes.

42:43.897 --> 42:45.440
I love you, Ozzie.

42:46.191 --> 42:47.860
I love you, Mom.

43:04.710 --> 43:06.712
