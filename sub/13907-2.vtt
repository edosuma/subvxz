what is your assessment
of the situation?

13:36.010 --> 13:38.023
Stanley, when dealing
with Mojo Jojo,

13:38.025 --> 13:40.005
we're talking pure evil.

13:40.007 --> 13:42.028
We got guns,
we got tanks,
we got missiles

13:43.000 --> 13:44.017
all aimed at
the mayor's office,

13:44.019 --> 13:47.007
but pure evil
cannot be stopped
by these methods.

13:47.009 --> 13:49.015
It seems as though
evil will prevail.

13:49.017 --> 13:51.025
Thank you for your time,
Chief Hittledee.

You'll never guess
what's for breakfast.

14:17.007 --> 14:19.017
Pancakes!

14:20.007 --> 14:23.013
No one understands me!

14:32.004 --> 14:34.013
Newscaster:
We interrupt this program
for a breaking news update.

14:34.015 --> 14:36.005
Hello. This is
Stanley Whitfield,

14:36.007 --> 14:37.021
live in front
of City Hall,

14:37.023 --> 14:42.004
where Mojo Jojo still has
our beloved mayor captive.

14:43.003 --> 14:45.001
And if this situation
isn't already horrific,

14:45.003 --> 14:47.016
last night it accelerated
to new heights.

14:47.018 --> 14:50.021
On the phone with us
is rescue theorist
Maria Santiago.

14:50.023 --> 14:51.028
Are you there, Maria?

14:52.000 --> 14:53.007
Yes. Hello, Stanley.

14:53.009 --> 14:55.016
Maria, as we
show the viewers
last night's footage,

14:55.018 --> 14:56.013
could you please comment?

14:56.015 --> 14:57.016
Yes, of course.

14:57.018 --> 14:59.003
At approximately
7:45 P.M. last night,

14:59.005 --> 15:00.017
when the situation
looked its darkest,

15:00.019 --> 15:04.005
the Powerpuff Girls
arrived at the scene.

15:05.019 --> 15:08.011
Once inside, it seemed
the Powerpuff Girls had
Mojo Jojo on the run.

15:09.011 --> 15:13.000
But just then,
the tables turned.

15:13.002 --> 15:14.015
Mojo Jojo reclaimed his control.

15:14.017 --> 15:16.024
Townsville could be
in big, big trouble. Stanley?

15:16.026 --> 15:18.004
Stanley: Thank you, Maria.

15:18.006 --> 15:20.020
This is a grim day
for Townsville.

15:20.022 --> 15:22.022
Not only is the mayor
being held hostage,

15:22.024 --> 15:26.016
but so are the Powerpuff Girls.

15:29.008 --> 15:32.022
Dinner will be ready
in 15, honey.

15:46.023 --> 15:48.024
Leave me alone!

Hello, this is
Stanley Whitfield,

15:53.023 --> 15:55.005
live in front of
City Hall.

15:55.007 --> 15:57.013
It's day 3
of the hostage situation,

15:57.015 --> 15:59.004
and we're still at a standstill.

15:59.006 --> 16:00.000

16:07.005 --> 16:08.024

16:08.026 --> 16:11.004
Thank you, Powerpuff Girls!

16:11.006 --> 16:14.012
Bless your huge little heads!

16:18.015 --> 16:20.015
Sorry, dear--
no private time tonight.

16:20.017 --> 16:22.007
We're having dinner guests.

16:22.009 --> 16:23.003
[Doorbell rings]

16:23.005 --> 16:25.023
Oh, good, they're here.

16:26.014 --> 16:28.021
Look who's here!

16:28.023 --> 16:30.004
Hiya, neighbors!

16:30.006 --> 16:32.027
Thank you
for inviting us.

16:39.004 --> 16:41.012
Yeah, uh...hi.

16:41.014 --> 16:43.029
Gosh, it's, uh,
great to see you.

16:44.001 --> 16:46.026
Maryann, I-I don't
think tonight's

16:46.028 --> 16:49.004
going to, uh, be a good,
uh, night, uh,

16:49.006 --> 16:52.005
you know, for this,
uh...tonight.

16:52.013 --> 16:54.010
[Embarrassed laugh]

16:54.012 --> 16:55.014
Just a moment.

16:55.016 --> 16:57.009
You listen to me,
Harold!

16:57.011 --> 17:00.006
That family has
lived a nightmare
for the past 3 days,

17:00.008 --> 17:02.013
and we're going
to be good neighbors
and help them out

17:02.015 --> 17:04.005
through these
troubled times.

17:04.007 --> 17:05.004
Do not, Harold,

17:05.006 --> 17:07.001
<i>ruin this dinner!</i>

17:07.003 --> 17:08.025
Come in!

17:10.020 --> 17:13.028
Now isn't this nice?

17:14.000 --> 17:14.023
Oh, yes.

17:14.025 --> 17:16.018
It's nice to
relax with friends

17:16.020 --> 17:18.027
after a long battle
against evil.

17:18.029 --> 17:19.026
That's right.

17:19.028 --> 17:22.027
You really took care
of Mojo Jojo, huh?

17:22.029 --> 17:23.023
You know, buddy,

17:23.025 --> 17:25.010
I-I really, uh,
think that

17:25.012 --> 17:28.000
maybe we--we--we
should talk about

17:28.002 --> 17:29.008
something else.

17:29.010 --> 17:30.006
Okay, Dad--

17:30.008 --> 17:32.023
let's talk about <i>your</i>
amazing day.

17:32.025 --> 17:35.017
How many mustard jars
<i>did</i><i>you fill?</i>

17:35.019 --> 17:37.017
We don't mind
telling the story.

17:37.019 --> 17:39.028
And to start,
villains are stupid.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.007
Uh, excuse me.

17:41.009 --> 17:43.003
Hi-ho, I'm just
going to just

17:43.005 --> 17:45.019
quickly use
the bathroom.

17:45.021 --> 17:46.015
So anyway,

17:46.017 --> 17:49.007
we busted in
on Mojo and...

17:59.019 --> 18:01.027
All right, Harold,
you can--you can do this.

18:01.029 --> 18:05.015
Just make it through
this one night, just one night.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.029
Great.

18:09.001 --> 18:13.010
Bubbles: Then I started
to smash his face!

18:15.013 --> 18:18.019
Basically there's
no villain around
that could take us.

18:18.021 --> 18:21.019
Harold: Oh, really?

18:27.018 --> 18:28.027
[Embarrassed laugh]

18:28.029 --> 18:31.001
What a joker
Harold is.

18:31.003 --> 18:33.022
You're joking,
right, Harold?

18:33.024 --> 18:36.027
No. I'm finally free, Maryann.

18:36.029 --> 18:39.018
I'm the arch-villain
I always wanted to be.

18:39.020 --> 18:43.013
No more mustard jars
and routine days for me!

18:43.015 --> 18:46.012
And definitely no more
average Harold Smith!

18:46.014 --> 18:49.013
I am now supervillain--

18:49.015 --> 18:51.017
uh, Harold Smith!

18:54.009 --> 18:56.008
All right, Dad!

18:56.010 --> 18:58.006
So tell me, Harold,

18:58.008 --> 18:59.010
what are you
going to do

18:59.012 --> 19:02.020
with this newfound
identity, hmm?

19:02.022 --> 19:04.021
I'm glad you asked,
Maryann.

19:04.023 --> 19:06.009
I'm going to take
this ray gun

19:06.011 --> 19:08.014
and melt the
Professor's head

19:08.016 --> 19:11.014
clear off his shoulders,
ha ha ha ha!

19:11.016 --> 19:13.001
And that's just
for starters.

19:17.011 --> 19:19.003
Stop it!
Stop it, stop it!

19:19.005 --> 19:20.021
You are not going to
ruin this dinner,

19:20.023 --> 19:22.002
I worked too hard on it!

19:22.004 --> 19:24.019
Everyone to the table--
<i>now!</i>

19:24.021 --> 19:28.007
Ahh, we're going to have
a nice evening together.

19:28.009 --> 19:32.003
Mm-hmm. But the second
that meal is over,

19:49.016 --> 19:51.024
Does anyone want to play
jacks after dinner?

19:51.026 --> 19:55.008
Man, Dad, you're
the coolest.

19:55.010 --> 19:56.006
I'm done.

19:56.008 --> 19:58.021
This is so good,
Mrs. Smith,

19:58.023 --> 20:02.011
that I'm going
to just take my time

20:02.013 --> 20:04.015
with this plate here.

20:04.017 --> 20:05.010
I'm done.

20:05.012 --> 20:06.008
I'm done.

20:06.010 --> 20:07.013
I'm done.

20:07.015 --> 20:09.022
We should do this
more often.

20:09.024 --> 20:12.012
Does anybody want to play
jacks after dinner?

20:12.014 --> 20:15.013
Man, Dad,
you're the coolest.

20:15.015 --> 20:17.018
Eat your pea, Professor.

20:32.000 --> 20:32.027

21:01.000 --> 21:04.004
Oh, for crying
out loud, Maryann!

21:04.006 --> 21:05.025
It's coconut cream pie.

21:05.027 --> 21:08.002
I made one
for each of you.

21:08.004 --> 21:11.013
Well, you <i>do</i><i>make great</i>
coconut cream pies, Maryann.

21:11.015 --> 21:13.026
Then eat up, Harold!
