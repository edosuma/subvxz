00:17.882 --> 00:19.449
Hey, guys.

00:33.298 --> 00:36.265
Okay, let's go! Let's go in the museum.

00:36.267 --> 00:37.200
Come on, everyone.

00:37.202 --> 00:39.369
Hey, Lucas, Miguel! Wait up!

00:39.371 --> 00:40.816
Hey, Monique.

00:43.708 --> 00:45.975
Let's go, everyone. Stick together.

00:45.977 --> 00:48.444
We're going inside now.

00:49.714 --> 00:51.280
Right here! Right here, right here.

00:51.282 --> 00:53.182
You want to take a picture?
Are you serious, dude?

00:53.184 --> 00:54.417
All right.

00:54.419 --> 00:57.002
Hello, I'm Ryan Rojas,
inviting you to join us

00:57.004 --> 00:59.722
as we revisit
how the American West was won.

01:02.927 --> 01:05.795
Monique, can you text me that?

01:11.736 --> 01:15.071
Okay, let's go.
Watch your step on these stairs.

01:15.073 --> 01:17.306
And go ahead and file in.

01:30.588 --> 01:31.854
This way. Come on.

01:37.662 --> 01:39.662
Come on, this way.

01:47.072 --> 01:48.768
Hey! You ruined my shot!

01:48.770 --> 01:49.770
Shh!

02:08.592 --> 02:11.661
And that's the last anyone saw
of these three boys...

02:11.663 --> 02:13.362
11:03 a.m. this morning.

02:13.364 --> 02:14.831
An hour later, when teachers discovered

02:14.833 --> 02:16.466
they were gone, we responded.

02:16.468 --> 02:18.601
I had the folks in C.I. gather
all the student and teacher

02:18.603 --> 02:20.269
cellphone video and photographs.

02:20.271 --> 02:21.537
And synched it with
local surveillance footage,

02:21.539 --> 02:23.206
hoping to get a clue, but no luck.

02:23.208 --> 02:25.241
Well, 11:03 this morning?

02:25.243 --> 02:28.644
Chief, you know,
nine hours isn't missing

02:28.646 --> 02:30.146
for 15 year olds.

02:30.148 --> 02:31.714
They're probably at the beach.

02:31.716 --> 02:32.982
Yeah, maybe they planned

02:32.984 --> 02:34.951
to be back by the end of the field trip

02:34.953 --> 02:36.352
and just lost track of time.

02:36.354 --> 02:37.954
Or just got lost, period.

02:37.956 --> 02:39.255
Not a great neighborhood for that.

02:39.257 --> 02:40.890
What about their cellphones?

02:40.892 --> 02:42.325
Turned off... batteries out.

02:42.327 --> 02:44.193
These three boys are off the grid.

02:44.195 --> 02:46.062
Yeah, so their parents can't find them,

02:46.064 --> 02:47.563
or because of us.

02:47.565 --> 02:49.465
I think what we're all wondering, Chief,

02:49.467 --> 02:51.934
is what makes <i>this</i> incident different

02:51.936 --> 02:54.370
from all the other teens
who skipped school today?

02:54.372 --> 02:57.073
Buzz, can you find that video of
all three boys posing outside?

02:57.075 --> 02:58.774
Yes, sir.

02:58.776 --> 03:00.309
These boys...

03:00.311 --> 03:01.978
aren't troublemakers.

03:01.980 --> 03:03.713
All three are honorroll students

03:03.715 --> 03:06.482
and members of St. Joseph
of Nazareth's Campus Ministry,

03:06.484 --> 03:08.384
working hand in hand with
the church's youth programs.

03:08.386 --> 03:12.255
Three 15 year olds working
hand in hand with the church.

03:12.257 --> 03:14.223
Now where have I heard that before?

03:14.225 --> 03:16.058
My daughter and both of my sons

03:16.060 --> 03:18.261
attended St. Joseph's, Lieutenant.

03:18.263 --> 03:22.064
No priest in my parish has ever
been accused of wrongdoing.

03:22.066 --> 03:24.033
I assume, Chief, there's something else?

03:24.035 --> 03:26.151
- There is.
- Is this what you wanted, Chief?

03:26.153 --> 03:27.803
Yes. Thank you, Buzz.

03:27.805 --> 03:30.940
That "something else"
you're assuming, Commander,

03:30.942 --> 03:32.575
would be the boy on the far right.

03:32.577 --> 03:34.177
His name's Lucas Garza, and he's been

03:34.179 --> 03:36.212
a TypeA diabetic since he was seven.

03:36.214 --> 03:38.347
He may have an insulin kit
in his jacket, but...

03:38.349 --> 03:41.484
Nine hours missing...
Lucas could already be in shock.

03:41.486 --> 03:43.619
Yes, which makes this disappearing act

03:43.621 --> 03:44.921
even more worrisome.

03:44.923 --> 03:47.490
Plus, the middle boy, Ryan Rojas?

03:47.492 --> 03:49.158
Two months ago, his stepfather died,

03:49.160 --> 03:50.693
putting him and his mother
in financial trouble.

03:50.695 --> 03:53.462
And the other kid,
Miguel Diaz, is a Dreamer.

03:53.464 --> 03:55.531
Teachers say he would never
bring unwanted attention

03:55.533 --> 03:57.266
on to his family, who are undocumented.

03:57.268 --> 03:59.001
Also, I have at least one

03:59.003 --> 04:00.369
freakedout parent of each of these kids

04:00.371 --> 04:02.071
in my office right now... unusual.

04:02.073 --> 04:04.207
Look, Chief, Julio lost his mom

04:04.209 --> 04:06.442
and has days of bereavement leave left,

04:06.444 --> 04:09.312
and the Commander, Nolan, and Mike

04:09.314 --> 04:10.813
are still getting over the flu.

04:10.815 --> 04:13.549
Well, we can't just stop working
till Julio gets back,

04:13.551 --> 04:14.984
and II'm almost well.

04:14.986 --> 04:16.719
Well, better, anyway.

04:16.721 --> 04:17.987
Excuse me, Commander.

04:17.988 --> 04:19.755
I'd like to ask Chief Mason a question,

04:19.757 --> 04:22.024
for my own edification...

04:22.026 --> 04:24.327
Why is this a Major Crime?

04:24.329 --> 04:26.362
If we were dealing
with three missing white boys

04:26.364 --> 04:28.531
from HarvardWestlake,
and one of them had diabetes

04:28.533 --> 04:30.199
- and maybe...
- This is not about race.

04:30.201 --> 04:32.268
Right now? It's always
about race, Lieutenant.

04:32.270 --> 04:33.669
That's just the way it is.

04:37.375 --> 04:40.109
By the time we investigate
a fullon critical missing, sir,

04:40.111 --> 04:41.811
these boys will probably be back home.

04:41.813 --> 04:44.013
And if that happens, Nolan,
you have my permission

04:44.015 --> 04:45.248
to tuck them in and bawl them out.

04:45.250 --> 04:46.749
But right now, I'd rather overreact

04:46.751 --> 04:48.851
than discover I didn't
pay enough attention later.

04:48.853 --> 04:52.855
So, if you want to know what
makes this a Major Crime,

04:52.857 --> 04:53.923
I guess I do.

04:56.594 --> 04:58.928
Well, that is all we need to know.

04:58.930 --> 05:00.496
As of this moment,

05:00.498 --> 05:04.033
these three boys are a critical missing.

05:04.035 --> 05:05.701
Chief, you said the parents are here?

05:05.703 --> 05:07.703
With articles of their sons' clothing...

05:07.705 --> 05:09.138
which I hope to God we don't need.

05:15.213 --> 05:17.680
As a diabetic,
my son keeps a strict schedule.

05:17.682 --> 05:19.915
It's so unlike Lucas to skip school.

05:19.917 --> 05:22.685
He's never even left Mass early,
much much less a field trip.

05:22.687 --> 05:26.589
Well, there's a first time
for everything, Ms. Garza.

05:26.591 --> 05:28.124
Do you have any idea

05:28.126 --> 05:30.893
where Lucas and his friends
could have gone?

05:30.895 --> 05:32.628
Maybe he forgot his insulin,

05:32.630 --> 05:34.363
and he went back to school to get it.

05:34.365 --> 05:36.365
Are you sure he didn't take
an Uber or a Lyft

05:36.367 --> 05:38.234
- back to St. Joseph's?
- Well, we have officers

05:38.236 --> 05:40.403
in front of the school
and in front of your house

05:40.405 --> 05:41.937
<i>in case Lucas shows up.</i>

05:41.939 --> 05:44.006
<i>Now, to your knowledge,
did any of these boys...</i>

05:44.008 --> 05:45.975
All this trouble
and the boys are probably

05:45.977 --> 05:47.543
just at a double feature somewhere.

05:47.545 --> 05:49.578
A double feature somewhere?

05:49.580 --> 05:51.914
Should we be looking
for these kids in the 1950s?

05:51.916 --> 05:54.016
I mean, where do they have
double features anymore?

05:54.018 --> 05:55.451
I doubt they went to the movies,

05:55.453 --> 05:56.952
but they didn't just slip away.

05:56.954 --> 05:59.255
They had a destination in mind...

05:59.257 --> 06:01.724
- but where?
<i>- Should I call my husband?</i>

06:02.112 --> 06:04.493
<i>MMateo's been performing
knee surgeries all day and...</i>

06:04.495 --> 06:06.929
<i>Well, if you want to</i> text <i>your husband</i>

06:06.931 --> 06:09.332
<i>and see if he knows about
all of this, please.</i>

06:09.334 --> 06:11.434
I need to separate Mr. and Mrs. Diaz,

06:11.436 --> 06:13.202
- and I'm out of bodies.
- Mike?

06:13.204 --> 06:15.037
Still checking
their socialmedia sites...

06:15.039 --> 06:16.839
- want me to stop?
- No. Stay there.

06:16.841 --> 06:20.042
Buzz, looks like it's time
to put your reserve

06:20.044 --> 06:22.078
detective skills to a test.

06:22.080 --> 06:23.746
- Really?
- Yes.

06:23.748 --> 06:25.348
Okay.

06:25.350 --> 06:27.450
This is the break room,

06:27.452 --> 06:29.185
Visitor's Conference Center,

06:31.255 --> 06:33.356
Remember, you ask the questions.

06:33.358 --> 06:35.024
He knows that, Andy.

06:35.026 --> 06:36.092
Good luck, Buzz.

06:36.094 --> 06:38.194
- Thanks.
- Let's go, let's go.

06:38.196 --> 06:39.662
- I think I need a tie.
- You don't need a tie.

06:39.664 --> 06:40.863
<i>Promise.</i>

06:40.865 --> 06:42.365
<i>Right.</i>

06:42.367 --> 06:44.367
<i>Mateo says...
II don't if this is important,</i>

06:44.369 --> 06:47.169
<i>but when you're asked
if anyone disliked Lucas,</i>

06:47.171 --> 06:49.672
Mateo reminded me that he had received

06:49.674 --> 06:52.908
a very angry phone call
from a Marvin Garret.

06:52.910 --> 06:55.544
He's a next door neighbor
of Miguel's family.

06:55.546 --> 06:59.014
<i>Apparently, Marvin Garret was
saying that he wanted Lucas</i>

06:59.016 --> 07:00.716
to stay away from his daughter.

07:01.719 --> 07:03.352
I can't remember her name right now.

07:03.354 --> 07:05.321
Um... I'm sorry. I'm drawing a blank.

07:05.323 --> 07:07.223
<i>Well, was there ever any trouble</i>

07:07.225 --> 07:09.225
<i>between this girl and Lucas?</i>

07:09.227 --> 07:11.127
There's a young lady in the mix.

07:11.129 --> 07:12.582
- What a surprise.
<i>- But apparently.</i>

07:12.606 --> 07:14.063
<i>Mr. Garret was extremely rude,</i>

07:14.065 --> 07:15.464
<i>saying that he wanted...</i>

07:15.466 --> 07:17.633
<i>Kelly! Kelly... That was her name.</i>

07:17.635 --> 07:20.803
<i>He wanted Kelly to stop
hanging out with Mexicans.</i>

07:20.805 --> 07:22.405
<i>I think Mr. Garret's daughter</i>

07:22.407 --> 07:24.740
has a little crush on Lucas.

07:24.742 --> 07:27.476
Maybe Lucas has one on her, too.

07:27.478 --> 07:29.211
Mr. Garret doesn't like it.

07:29.213 --> 07:32.348
Did Mr. Garret ever threaten Lucas

07:32.350 --> 07:34.049
or anyone in your family?

07:34.051 --> 07:36.986
No, but Marvin reported
us to Immigration again.

07:36.988 --> 07:39.989
He stopped me while
I was coming out of my driveway

07:39.991 --> 07:43.170
to tell me that we should move
before ICE detained us.

07:43.171 --> 07:44.225
I don't get it.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.562
Marvin Garret came after you
because his daughter

07:46.564 --> 07:48.297
wanted to date someone else's son?

07:48.299 --> 07:50.966
Well, first, Kelly
was interested in Miguel.

07:50.968 --> 07:52.868
But both Lucas and Ryan...

07:52.870 --> 07:54.336
They hang out at our place.

07:54.338 --> 07:56.705
We live right by St. Joseph of Nazareth,

07:56.707 --> 07:59.675
<i>and Kelly knows all of them very well.</i>

07:59.677 --> 08:01.544
<i>We treat them all like our own children.</i>

08:01.546 --> 08:03.446
Kelly Garret is 16 years old.

08:03.448 --> 08:06.415
The older woman
with a driver's license.

08:06.417 --> 08:10.019
Maybe she was at the museum
to pick them up.

08:10.021 --> 08:13.122
<i>- Did the boys ever argue over Kelly?
- No.</i>

08:13.124 --> 08:14.690
<i>- It was never that serious.</i>
- Buzz, could you please

08:14.692 --> 08:17.026
ask Mr. Diaz about his neighbor.

08:17.028 --> 08:20.629
<i>Marvin Garret who was trying
to deport his family.</i>

08:20.631 --> 08:22.765
We could flip more houses,
but you don't want

08:22.767 --> 08:24.767
to bid too hard against legal residents.

08:24.769 --> 08:26.936
They can call Immigration... it happens.

08:26.938 --> 08:29.905
If you're worried about ICE,
then your neighbor Marvin

08:29.907 --> 08:32.006
must make you extra anxious.

08:32.009 --> 08:33.642
You know about Marvin?

08:33.644 --> 08:36.010
Yeah, Marvin doesn't like us,
sure, but it...

08:36.013 --> 08:37.880
it's mostly because
of his daughter, Kelly.

08:37.881 --> 08:41.909
My son and his two best friends
are almost her age,

08:41.912 --> 08:44.119
and... she kind of likes all of them...

08:44.121 --> 08:46.155
<i>- in different ways.
- Different ways?</i>

08:46.157 --> 08:48.324
<i>Is that a problem
for your son and his friends?</i>

08:48.326 --> 08:49.558
No, no, no. No.

08:49.560 --> 08:51.861
Miguel is very close with these boys.

08:51.863 --> 08:53.429
Us, too. Us, too.

08:53.431 --> 08:54.797
We keep insulin around for Lucas,

08:54.799 --> 08:57.766
and we've tried to step in for Ryan.

08:57.768 --> 09:00.941
You know, his family situation was...

09:01.339 --> 09:03.138
- not great.
- Not great how?

09:03.140 --> 09:05.508
My first husband
was a worthless piece of crap...

09:05.510 --> 09:07.376
cheated on me all the time,

09:07.378 --> 09:09.778
never paid child support for Ryan,

09:09.780 --> 09:12.535
doesn't let us know
how to get in touch with him.

09:13.284 --> 09:14.717
At least I got my son out of it.

09:14.719 --> 09:16.819
Now, Hector... <i>Ay carajo.</i>

09:18.222 --> 09:20.456
Your second husband's
supposed to be better.

09:20.458 --> 09:22.491
Mine was worse... I learned nothing.

09:22.493 --> 09:24.960
And Hector passed away
a couple of months ago.

09:24.962 --> 09:27.329
Fell... maybe jumped...

09:27.331 --> 09:29.999
from our apartment balcony,
drunk or high.

09:30.001 --> 09:32.268
Look, Hector paid his own way
and then some.

09:32.270 --> 09:33.369
I'll give him that.

09:33.371 --> 09:34.837
But he lied to me.

09:34.839 --> 09:36.939
He hadn't left the gangs at all.

09:36.941 --> 09:38.436
And...

09:39.043 --> 09:40.543
he got physical with Ryan...

09:40.545 --> 09:42.244
knocked him around a little.

09:42.246 --> 09:44.213
Your husband <i>fell</i> off your balcony

09:44.215 --> 09:46.282
after beating your son?

09:46.284 --> 09:48.684
Don't worry about
what Hector did to Ryan.

09:48.686 --> 09:51.587
<i>Worry about what I'm gonna do to Ryan.</i>

09:51.589 --> 09:53.856
Have you checked
with my first husband... Ian?

09:53.858 --> 09:56.058
<i>He tried to take Ryan
out of school two weeks ago</i>

09:56.060 --> 09:57.293
<i>without my permission.</i>

09:57.295 --> 09:58.661
<i>And he's done that before, too.</i>

09:58.663 --> 10:00.362
<i>Otherwise, I can't be missing work...</i>

10:00.364 --> 10:01.864
All right, it's time to hit everyone

10:01.866 --> 10:04.900
with consent forms to search
their houses and devices.

10:04.902 --> 10:06.168
We got to get moving.

10:06.170 --> 10:08.174
Commander.

10:09.473 --> 10:10.639
Father Stan.

10:10.641 --> 10:12.308
Sharon.

10:12.310 --> 10:13.309
Are you okay?

10:13.311 --> 10:15.444
Yes, I'm just, um...

10:15.446 --> 10:18.180
I'm still shaking off the remnants

10:18.182 --> 10:19.915
of that terrible flu.

10:19.917 --> 10:21.917
Well, hopefully, we won't make it worse.

10:21.919 --> 10:23.619
I brought Father Jonas Alcaraz,

10:23.621 --> 10:25.754
- new head of our Campus Ministry.
- Hello, Father.

10:25.756 --> 10:27.256
He spends more time
with these missing boys

10:27.258 --> 10:28.524
than anyone on our faculty.

10:28.526 --> 10:29.992
I'm feeling just...

10:29.994 --> 10:32.394
Terrible that
I wasn't at the museum today.

10:32.396 --> 10:34.663
I'd have noticed
they were gone much faster.

10:34.665 --> 10:36.697
You pay that close attention to them?

10:36.699 --> 10:38.683
You're responsible
for their commitment to Christ,

10:38.685 --> 10:40.002
not their science tests.

10:40.415 --> 10:43.706
Sharon, thank you for what
you're doing to find our boys.

10:43.708 --> 10:45.474
And for moving so quickly.

10:45.476 --> 10:48.277
Well, maybe not quickly enough.
Father, may I?

10:49.109 --> 10:51.580
A teacher found Lucas Garza's
backpack on the bus.

10:51.582 --> 10:53.616
He didn't have it with him
at the museum today.

11:01.058 --> 11:02.652
Are those insulin kits?

11:08.265 --> 11:09.498
If Lucas doesn't have his meds,

11:09.500 --> 11:10.899
we might already be out of time.

11:10.901 --> 11:13.969
Mike, I need you
to gather all the boys' clothing

11:13.971 --> 11:15.533
from the interview rooms.

11:16.440 --> 11:18.507
Chief, I'm going to need

11:18.509 --> 11:21.410
some extra personnel and some dogs.

11:25.983 --> 11:29.084
I'm going to need a lot of dogs.

11:38.678 --> 11:41.212
All of their families have issues.

11:41.214 --> 11:44.312
Miguel and his parents are undocumented.

11:44.314 --> 11:46.417
Lucas' father has
one of the most successful

11:46.419 --> 11:49.490
surgical practices in America,
but he has health issues.

11:49.591 --> 11:50.723
And though we didn't find out

11:50.725 --> 11:52.325
until after his stepfather died,

11:52.327 --> 11:53.613
Ryan...

11:54.029 --> 11:55.728
was physically abused for two years.

11:55.730 --> 11:57.930
Yet they're all doing well at school

11:57.932 --> 12:00.800
and, from this distance,
seem relatively happy.

12:00.802 --> 12:02.468
Well, I credit their friendship
for that...

12:02.470 --> 12:04.637
and Father Jonas, of course.

12:04.639 --> 12:06.506
But I hate this happened
while these boys

12:06.508 --> 12:07.874
were under St. Joseph's supervision.

12:07.876 --> 12:10.443
I... Maybe if they'd been
in school uniforms...

12:10.445 --> 12:13.299
You know, we let them wear
what they want on field trips.

12:13.815 --> 12:16.349
Will we find them? Soon?

12:16.351 --> 12:17.717
If the boys stuck together

12:17.719 --> 12:20.348
and we have a <i>little</i> luck, I hope.

12:24.192 --> 12:26.926
And I talked to the young lady
you met at Ascension Day,

12:26.928 --> 12:29.729
and she would be honored
to sing at your wedding.

12:29.731 --> 12:30.969
I gave her your number.

12:30.994 --> 12:33.766
That's a bit of good
news on a terrible night.

12:33.768 --> 12:35.902
Thank you, Father, for arranging that.

12:35.904 --> 12:38.304
And with everything else
that you have to do.

12:38.306 --> 12:40.073
In the middle of crisis, life goes on...

12:40.075 --> 12:42.537
Something our work teaches both of us.

12:43.511 --> 12:45.078
And here's her ring bearer.

12:45.080 --> 12:46.512
Yeah, well, one of 'em.

12:46.514 --> 12:47.947
Hey, Father Stan.

12:47.949 --> 12:51.117
I'd... I'd hate to interrupt,
but Mom has to eat.

12:51.119 --> 12:53.786
I'm trying to get my appetite back.

12:53.788 --> 12:55.888
Yeah. This was a tough flu.

12:55.890 --> 12:58.524
At one point, almost a third
of our students were out sick.

12:58.526 --> 12:59.959
Poor Julio's mother.

13:00.221 --> 13:01.394
I'm stopping by his house tomorrow.

13:01.396 --> 13:04.797
Please remind him
that we are here if he needs us.

13:04.799 --> 13:06.399
And if you hear anything
about these boys,

13:06.401 --> 13:07.600
anything at all...

13:11.139 --> 13:12.672
They didn't have the salad you wanted,

13:12.674 --> 13:14.140
so I got that...

13:14.142 --> 13:17.643
horrible broccolicarrotquinoa
thing that you like

13:17.645 --> 13:19.445
and a little bit of chicken soup.

13:19.447 --> 13:20.680
Maybe you'll be better

13:20.682 --> 13:22.615
by your doctor's appointment tomorrow.

13:23.718 --> 13:25.580
All right.

13:26.955 --> 13:28.788
Are you kidding me?

13:28.790 --> 13:30.656
They put mustard on my hamburger bun

13:30.658 --> 13:31.657
without asking me.

13:31.659 --> 13:33.192
Why would anybody do that?

13:36.331 --> 13:37.663
Sorry. Sorry, Sharon.

13:37.665 --> 13:42.034
I just feel like nothing has
been going right for me today...

13:42.036 --> 13:43.069
at all.

13:43.071 --> 13:44.904
Did Gus ever call you back

13:44.906 --> 13:47.740
or respond to any of your text messages?

13:47.742 --> 13:49.108
No, no, um...

13:49.110 --> 13:53.713
but his boss, Aiden,
posted four Instagram photos

13:53.715 --> 13:56.182
of them at a club
in San Francisco, dancing.

13:56.184 --> 14:00.386
You are following Gus'<i>boss</i> on Instagram?

14:00.388 --> 14:02.755
Yeah. Yeah. I am,
and I'm not proud of it.

14:02.757 --> 14:06.159
But those Instagram photos
explain Gus' complete

14:06.161 --> 14:08.461
lack of communication with me
over the past four days.

14:08.463 --> 14:11.330
Clearly, there's stuff
that he doesn't want to tell me,

14:11.332 --> 14:12.418
and...

14:12.867 --> 14:14.587
now he doesn't have to.

14:14.936 --> 14:17.270
Maybe call again anyway.

14:17.632 --> 14:19.005
I want to,

14:19.007 --> 14:22.208
to hear him explain
why he's been avoiding me,

14:22.210 --> 14:23.346
but...

14:24.379 --> 14:26.512
I'm not gonna hunt him down.

14:30.518 --> 14:33.219
So, they were last seen moving
in this direction,

14:33.221 --> 14:35.688
past the yellow school buses,

14:35.690 --> 14:37.790
where the other kids did not go,

14:37.792 --> 14:39.292
so it gives us a fighting chance.

14:39.294 --> 14:41.027
Prep for search!

14:41.364 --> 14:43.930
Let's start with our missing diabetic,

14:43.932 --> 14:46.299
see where that takes us.

14:48.436 --> 14:50.269
I don't understand why you want to look

14:50.271 --> 14:51.904
in the one place we know he's not.

14:51.906 --> 14:54.006
If Lucas were home,
we wouldn't need you!

14:54.008 --> 14:56.242
Ms. Garza, Dr. Garza,

14:56.244 --> 14:58.444
if the boys made a plan
to skip the field trip,

14:58.446 --> 15:00.713
we might find proof of that
in Lucas' room

15:00.715 --> 15:02.748
or on devices he uses.

15:02.750 --> 15:04.917
Lucas may have
hid something in your house.

15:04.919 --> 15:06.806
His situation is...

15:07.422 --> 15:08.788
We feel it's urgent.

15:08.790 --> 15:14.060
Sara, it's been 13 hours.
Okay, we have to help them.

15:16.097 --> 15:18.698
Lucas' room is... is this way.

15:22.203 --> 15:24.337
Watch your step, Lieutenant.

15:29.744 --> 15:31.744
Check out these classrooms, please.

15:31.746 --> 15:33.082
Let's see...

15:34.048 --> 15:35.960
This is Miguel's.

15:41.289 --> 15:42.655
Ryan's is over here.

15:42.657 --> 15:44.023
I doubt you'll find anything

15:44.025 --> 15:46.471
but what other kids keep
in their lockers.

15:49.998 --> 15:51.430
They know we can open these at any time,

15:51.432 --> 15:53.232
so they're not really
a safe place to stash...

15:53.234 --> 15:54.867
Father, I'm conducting this search,

15:54.869 --> 15:57.648
not you... stand aside. Now.

15:58.239 --> 15:59.905
I'm just trying to help, Lieutenant.

15:59.907 --> 16:01.826
No reason to be annoyed.

16:04.646 --> 16:06.812
So, tell me, Father,

16:06.814 --> 16:09.248
would any other kid at your school

16:09.250 --> 16:13.452
have a Mexican drug cartel bracelet...

16:13.454 --> 16:14.874
in his locker?

16:16.024 --> 16:17.189
I told you already...

16:17.191 --> 16:19.191
I had no idea Hector was a gangster.

16:19.193 --> 16:21.160
In fact, part of the reason
I married Hector

16:21.162 --> 16:23.562
was so Ryan could have
a good guy around the house,

16:23.564 --> 16:25.965
and that was a mistake.

16:25.967 --> 16:27.867
Where'd you think
Hector's money came from?

16:27.869 --> 16:28.901
He had money, right?

16:28.903 --> 16:30.503
He said he was in the...

16:30.505 --> 16:31.804
importexport business,

16:31.806 --> 16:33.906
which I don't know nothing about.

16:33.908 --> 16:35.508
I... I understand the codes

16:35.510 --> 16:37.343
hospitals use for billing insurance,

16:37.345 --> 16:39.524
and that's it.

16:40.381 --> 16:41.814
Hector fell from here?

16:41.816 --> 16:44.517
Or jumped? One or the other.

16:44.519 --> 16:46.562
The police weren't sure,
aand I wasn't here.

16:48.523 --> 16:49.855
How tall was he?

16:52.427 --> 16:54.060
The Death Report says 5'7".

16:54.062 --> 16:56.495
About. Maybe, yeah.

16:56.916 --> 16:58.564
So, he fell?

16:58.566 --> 17:00.132
How?

17:00.134 --> 17:02.735
Did he, like, get drunk,
walk on the balcony's edge,

17:02.737 --> 17:04.837
hang from it by his feet?

17:07.108 --> 17:09.303
Ryan was here at the time?

17:10.278 --> 17:12.098
In his room.

17:13.013 --> 17:14.814
He didn't even know
anything had happened

17:14.816 --> 17:16.482
till the police knocked on the door.

17:16.483 --> 17:17.516
Where was Ian,

17:17.518 --> 17:19.117
your first husband, Ryan's father?

17:19.119 --> 17:20.386
I have no idea.

17:20.387 --> 17:22.088
What about a last name, a date of birth?

17:22.089 --> 17:24.819
We'd like to notify Ian
that Ryan is missing.

17:25.326 --> 17:26.625
Let me look.

17:50.084 --> 17:52.284
Okay, I need you guys to check
the backyard,

17:52.286 --> 17:54.687
those hedges, the garage, the roof.

17:54.689 --> 17:55.921
They're not here.

17:55.923 --> 17:57.390
Excuse me, shouldn't you be out there,

17:57.392 --> 17:59.191
looking in the streets
or... or the trains

17:59.193 --> 18:01.135
or... or something
instead of our backyard?

18:01.137 --> 18:03.691
Sir? Sir?

18:04.499 --> 18:06.652
Right. Yes?

18:07.301 --> 18:08.734
You're finally deporting these people?

18:08.736 --> 18:10.536
I've only been calling 'em in
for five years.

18:10.538 --> 18:12.605
L.A.P.D., sir.
I need you to get off the wall

18:12.607 --> 18:14.640
- and step away...
- I'm standing on my own property.

18:14.642 --> 18:16.342
If you interfere
with this investigation,

18:16.344 --> 18:17.977
you'll standing
in front of a booking camera

18:17.979 --> 18:20.079
with a slate beneath your neck.

18:30.825 --> 18:33.125
Excuse me, why don't you want us

18:33.127 --> 18:35.127
to look under the floor of your closet?

18:35.129 --> 18:37.296
You... you speak Spanish?

18:37.298 --> 18:39.098
<i>Claro. </i> Officers!

18:43.204 --> 18:44.737
Ooh, this is...

18:44.739 --> 18:47.239
This is a lot of oxy to keep
in your garage, Doctor.

18:47.241 --> 18:49.141
Do you have a prescription for all this?

18:49.143 --> 18:51.076
You swore to me that you had stopped,

18:51.078 --> 18:52.778
that you had gotten rid of everything!

18:52.780 --> 18:53.946
I did get rid of everything.

18:53.948 --> 18:55.581
What is that she's holding then?!

18:55.583 --> 18:58.050
- I forgot that stuff was there, okay?
- My God! Mateo!

18:58.052 --> 19:00.820
If you're using again after all
that we have been through.

19:00.822 --> 19:02.221
This is not the issue here.

19:02.223 --> 19:03.956
You've only been out of rehab
for two weeks.

19:03.958 --> 19:06.358
- Does Lucas know?
- Would you just shut up?!

19:06.360 --> 19:09.128
Good God, Sara! Just shut up!

19:09.130 --> 19:12.765
Can you concentrate on Lucas
for just one minute?!

19:14.936 --> 19:17.470
Do the two of your argue
like this in front of your son?

19:21.075 --> 19:22.508
I don't see any signs of a struggle.

19:22.510 --> 19:25.744
But the dogs say the boys were here.

19:38.893 --> 19:40.192
Hey... Hey, look, it...

19:40.194 --> 19:42.261
it's no crime
to have cash in your house.

19:42.263 --> 19:43.462
About how much?

19:43.464 --> 19:45.231
Close to a million dollars, sir.

19:45.233 --> 19:46.599
It's exactly a million dollars,

19:46.601 --> 19:49.301
and every penny of it is legally ours.

19:49.303 --> 19:53.239
Why are you taking the money
instead of bringing back my son?

20:13.494 --> 20:15.060
Come on. Let's get this over with.

20:20.034 --> 20:23.080
Well, if the boys were here,
they weren't in this car.

20:24.939 --> 20:26.906
- So, what do we have?
- Not much.

20:26.908 --> 20:28.674
All three boys were tracked
to the same place,

20:28.676 --> 20:32.611
but their scent didn't go beyond
the traffic circle.

20:32.613 --> 20:35.214
So... someone was waiting for them,

20:35.216 --> 20:37.016
picked them up, and drove them away.

20:37.018 --> 20:39.385
It could have been Ryan's
biological father, Ian NuÃ±ez.

20:39.387 --> 20:41.053
He's tried to pick his son up before.

20:41.055 --> 20:42.354
Or some gang banger who knew

20:42.356 --> 20:44.390
that Ryan and his friends were rich.

20:44.392 --> 20:46.225
But would whoever grabbed them

20:46.227 --> 20:48.327
have known how much
Lucas needed insulin?

20:48.329 --> 20:51.230
Well, we have a lot more
drugrelated materials

20:51.232 --> 20:54.199
to discuss here...
a full bag of opiates,

20:54.201 --> 20:58.170
a dead cartel member,
a million bucks in cash,

20:58.172 --> 20:59.471
and, let's not forget

20:59.473 --> 21:01.640
the Catholic Church and Father Jonas,

21:01.642 --> 21:06.145
who was apparently
very close to these boys.

21:08.149 --> 21:09.882
Commander... it's your call.

21:09.884 --> 21:11.717
But I believe we need
to get photos of these boys

21:11.719 --> 21:13.986
out to the media as soon as possible,

21:13.988 --> 21:16.322
'cause they didn't just vanish
off the face of the Earth.

21:16.324 --> 21:17.690
No, they did not.

21:17.692 --> 21:21.327
It's beginning to look like
they were abducted.

21:28.607 --> 21:30.607
It started as a yearly field trip

21:30.648 --> 21:32.648
organized by the diocesis High school.

21:33.151 --> 21:34.477
<i>When it was over,</i>

21:34.479 --> 21:36.920
<i>three teenage boys under
the direct supervision</i>

21:36.922 --> 21:38.855
<i>of the Catholic Church were missing.</i>

21:38.857 --> 21:41.824
<i>Only two months after the death
of Ryan's stepfather...</i>

21:41.826 --> 21:45.328
<i>a gang member with connections
to a Mexican drug cartel...</i>

21:45.330 --> 21:46.796
<i>The three teenagers vanished</i>

21:46.798 --> 21:49.566
<i>with socalled Dreamer Miguel Diaz,</i>

21:49.568 --> 21:51.234
<i>originally from Tamaulipas,</i>

21:51.236 --> 21:54.537
<i>the Mexican state with
the highest kidnapping rate...</i>

21:54.539 --> 21:56.606
<i>The boy who grew up here, Lucas Garza,</i>

21:56.608 --> 21:58.942
<i>is a TypeA diabetic
and, without his insulin,</i>

21:58.944 --> 22:00.810
<i>could already be another casualty</i>

22:00.812 --> 22:03.413
<i>of the upswing in hate crimes
against Latinos and...</i>

22:03.415 --> 22:04.547
Lots of different theories.

22:04.549 --> 22:06.115
I don't care what the media says

22:06.117 --> 22:08.551
as long as they
get the boys' faces out there.

22:08.553 --> 22:10.219
The million in cash...

22:10.221 --> 22:12.255
- That bothers me.
- We're already looking into it, Chief.

22:12.257 --> 22:16.259
But what about my request
for more specialized personnel?

22:16.261 --> 22:19.329
I have a young expert
in your Murder Room right now

22:19.331 --> 22:20.430
catching up with the investigation.

22:20.432 --> 22:21.731
One expert?

22:21.733 --> 22:23.232
But worth many times that.

22:23.234 --> 22:25.435
Detective Camila Paige was
a goto utility hitter

22:25.437 --> 22:27.036
when I headed C.I.

22:27.038 --> 22:29.238
She transferred to Missing
Persons a yearandahalf ago

22:29.240 --> 22:31.474
and has become exceptional
at finding teenagers.

22:33.011 --> 22:35.011
Two cautionary things...

22:35.013 --> 22:36.646
Detective Paige is still working out

22:36.648 --> 22:39.649
how to be a part of a team,
and her manner is...

22:39.651 --> 22:42.619
Excuse me, Commander,
mind if I ask why no one here's

22:42.621 --> 22:44.454
trying to tap the phones
of these families yet?

22:44.456 --> 22:47.641
And you must be Detective Camila Paige.

22:48.360 --> 22:50.560
Sorry. I should've started by...

22:50.562 --> 22:52.161
Yes, I'm Detective Paige.

22:52.163 --> 22:53.863
Very happy that
you requested me, Commander,

22:53.865 --> 22:56.332
and hopeful I can contribute...
so much at stake.

22:56.334 --> 22:59.135
Yes, we have three young boys
who may be depending on us

22:59.137 --> 23:00.436
to save their lives.

23:00.438 --> 23:03.840
Warrants for wires
take time, but Narcotics

23:03.842 --> 23:06.342
can get this done much faster
than we can, Chief.

23:06.344 --> 23:07.810
Well, let me push the process.

23:07.812 --> 23:09.812
If someone makes a ransom demand
or the boys call in,

23:09.814 --> 23:11.014
- we need to know.
- Thank you.

23:11.016 --> 23:12.548
I'd also like to talk to the girl...

23:12.550 --> 23:13.883
what's her name...

23:13.885 --> 23:15.818
from next door to
the undocumented family...

23:15.820 --> 23:17.987
Kelly Garret's father won't
let her talk to us,

23:17.989 --> 23:19.856
and we have no means of coercing him,

23:19.858 --> 23:21.591
so we are surveilling their house

23:21.593 --> 23:24.060
in case the girl steps out on her own.

23:24.062 --> 23:26.496
- This way, please.
- Mom. Mom!

23:26.498 --> 23:27.663
- Yeah?
- Your doctor's appointment.

23:27.687 --> 23:28.865
It's in 40 minutes.

23:28.867 --> 23:30.733
- I'm gonna go in later.
- Wait! No, no, no!

23:30.735 --> 23:32.735
Look, II can call Andrea
and just ask her

23:32.737 --> 23:34.137
if I can run you there and back
really fast.

23:34.139 --> 23:37.440
Rusty, if Lucas Garza hasn't
taken his insulin,

23:37.442 --> 23:39.809
his situation is far worse than mine.

23:39.811 --> 23:42.612
And I'm fine. I'm better. I am.

23:43.782 --> 23:45.715
<i>We only have so much capital.</i>

23:45.717 --> 23:47.350
<i>AAnd we have to buy whatever...</i>

23:47.352 --> 23:49.352
Lieutenants Flynn and Tao, Buzz,

23:49.354 --> 23:52.622
this is Detective Camila Paige
from Missing Persons.

23:52.624 --> 23:57.326
She is an expert in locating teenagers.

23:57.328 --> 23:58.461
- Hi.
- Greetings.

23:58.463 --> 23:59.796
Miguel's parents are trying

23:59.798 --> 24:01.364
to explain the million dollars we found.

24:01.366 --> 24:03.666
<i>Been taxed through
our daughter's company.</i>

24:03.668 --> 24:05.702
<i>Which she has a right to own,</i>

24:05.704 --> 24:07.770
<i>because she's an American citizen.</i>

24:07.772 --> 24:09.372
Yeah, well, let me tell you
about the other four times

24:09.374 --> 24:12.442
that I found a million dollars
hidden in someone's house.

24:12.444 --> 24:14.043
The first time, it was drugs.

24:14.045 --> 24:16.412
Second time, it turned out to be...

24:16.414 --> 24:17.313
drugs.

24:17.315 --> 24:18.715
The third time, well,

24:18.717 --> 24:21.084
we discovered that it was drugs.

24:21.086 --> 24:22.528
The fourth time...

24:23.621 --> 24:25.054
Was it drugs?

24:25.056 --> 24:27.557
You know, yeah. I think it was.

24:27.559 --> 24:31.360
Maybe we... we should get a lawyer.

24:31.362 --> 24:34.030
Well, now, that's interesting,
because everyone else

24:34.032 --> 24:37.200
I found with a million dollars,
they wanted an attorney, too.

24:37.202 --> 24:38.601
What a coincidence.

24:38.603 --> 24:40.203
- This is just...
- You can't pay for a lawyer

24:40.205 --> 24:42.038
- with the money we found in your house.
- You listen...

24:42.040 --> 24:44.741
The only drugs that we have are the ones

24:44.743 --> 24:47.176
that you take for a headache or a cold.

24:47.178 --> 24:49.145
If someone knew you had
a million dollars

24:49.147 --> 24:50.713
in your house and was
demanding a ransom for your...

24:50.715 --> 24:53.683
No one kidnapped Miguel
because we have money.

24:53.685 --> 24:56.753
We left Mexico because
of all of the kidnappings.

24:56.755 --> 24:58.454
<i>Please, please, I'm begging you.</i>

24:58.456 --> 25:00.857
<i>- You have to find our son.</i>
- She may have a point.

25:00.859 --> 25:03.459
If you're looking
for a kidnapping victim,

25:03.461 --> 25:06.262
Lucas Garza is the obvious target.

25:06.264 --> 25:08.664
I looked it up, and
if you're a professional athlete

25:08.666 --> 25:09.932
and need your knee fixed,

25:09.934 --> 25:12.168
Dr. Garza or one of his associates

25:12.170 --> 25:13.703
is where you go.

25:13.705 --> 25:15.838
Garza's rich,

25:15.840 --> 25:18.241
and if you know his parents
have a million in cash,

25:18.243 --> 25:19.575
Miguel's valuable.

25:19.577 --> 25:21.544
But why grab Ryan?
His mom's got nothing.

25:21.546 --> 25:22.879
Yeah, I've been thinking
about that, too,

25:22.881 --> 25:25.148
and Ryan could have accidently

25:25.150 --> 25:26.983
set his friends up to be kidnapped

25:26.985 --> 25:29.218
just by talking about them
to the wrong people,

25:29.220 --> 25:31.621
especially if he was dealing
drugs on the side.

25:31.623 --> 25:34.991
Well, we haven't found any
gangster connections to Ryan.

25:34.993 --> 25:37.860
Still, he had a cartel bracelet
in his locker...

25:37.862 --> 25:39.695
probably belonged to his stepdad.

25:39.697 --> 25:42.765
It's Ryan's biological father
we need to find now,

25:42.767 --> 25:44.967
if nothing else but to notify him.

25:44.969 --> 25:46.803
Detective Paige, you get your wish.

25:46.805 --> 25:48.671
I want you to go
with Lieutenant Provenza...

25:48.673 --> 25:50.406
I know him really well.

25:52.644 --> 25:54.410
Hey, that's great news, Detective.

25:54.412 --> 25:56.012
Now maybe you'd like to hear

25:56.014 --> 25:57.364
what the Commander would like you to do.

25:57.388 --> 25:58.521
I know.

25:58.523 --> 26:01.083
She wants us to try and talk to
Marvin Garret's daughter, Kelly.

26:01.085 --> 26:02.919
If the boys were planning
something offthewall,

26:02.921 --> 26:05.089
then Lucas or Miguel might've told her.

26:05.723 --> 26:07.757
She could have even picked them up.

26:07.759 --> 26:10.259
Kelly has a driver's license,
access to a car...

26:10.261 --> 26:12.595
Detective Paige, thank you
for so completely

26:12.597 --> 26:14.030
anticipating my orders.

26:14.032 --> 26:15.865
Buzz, will you fill in for Julio again

26:15.867 --> 26:18.334
and go with the Lieutenant
and Detective Paige?

26:18.336 --> 26:20.436
Sure. Absolutely. Great.

26:20.438 --> 26:23.439
And I'll bring my camera, too,
just in case Kelly talks to us.

26:23.441 --> 26:26.709
Well, Mr. and Mrs. Diaz
certainly seem genuine.

26:26.711 --> 26:30.572
Still, a million bucks in cash, well...

26:30.862 --> 26:32.328
Cami?

26:32.517 --> 26:33.950
Cami!

26:33.952 --> 26:35.751
What are you doing here?

26:42.694 --> 26:45.061
Good morning. L.A.P.D.

26:45.063 --> 26:48.364
We need to search your offices,
so buzz open the doors now.

26:48.366 --> 26:50.466
I can't let those dogs in here.
Also, you can't look in any...

26:50.468 --> 26:52.802
- Would you rather shut down for the day?
- What?

26:52.804 --> 26:54.503
Look, you people don't understand.

26:54.505 --> 26:56.272
- HIPAA protects...
- HIPAA doesn't apply to this warrant.

26:56.274 --> 26:59.876
We can hold everyone here
while your lawyers explain that.

26:59.878 --> 27:01.477
That won't be necessary.

27:01.479 --> 27:03.145
Hi. I'm Dr. Alan Redmond.

27:03.147 --> 27:04.347
Is this about Lucas?

27:04.349 --> 27:05.414
Yes, it is.

27:05.416 --> 27:06.849
Please, come in. Right there.

27:11.956 --> 27:13.856
Are you looking for something specific?

27:13.858 --> 27:16.559
The boys? Large amounts of cash?

27:16.561 --> 27:18.294
Where's Dr. Garza's office?

27:18.296 --> 27:19.580
Right this way.

27:20.298 --> 27:23.165
We don't keep large amounts of cash.

27:23.167 --> 27:24.834
Most of our fees are collected

27:24.836 --> 27:29.038
from insurance companies,
credit cards, checks.

27:29.040 --> 27:30.706
- This is Dr. Garza's office...
- Unh, unh.

27:30.708 --> 27:32.041
Doctor, stand over there.

27:32.043 --> 27:33.260
Okay.

27:34.011 --> 27:36.212
When did you last see Lucas?

27:36.214 --> 27:38.714
About three weeks ago.

27:38.716 --> 27:40.116
Mrs. Garza was working late.

27:40.118 --> 27:41.851
Lucas came in and waited for her.

27:41.853 --> 27:44.086
And where was Dr. Garza at that time?

27:45.056 --> 27:47.590
His wife said he'd just
got out of rehab two weeks ago,

27:47.592 --> 27:51.093
and he had a large stash
of oxycodone at his house.

27:51.095 --> 27:52.828
Any idea where that
might have come from...

27:54.132 --> 27:55.064
It's clear.

27:55.066 --> 27:56.999
The oxy?

27:59.537 --> 28:03.306
We encourage our patients
to return the unused portion

28:03.308 --> 28:05.041
of their prescription painkillers.

28:05.043 --> 28:06.943
I think that Mateo was...

28:06.945 --> 28:09.378
You know, he was in a car
accident three years ago,

28:09.380 --> 28:11.380
and he's been trying to recover, right?

28:11.382 --> 28:15.051
Look, he never operated on
a patient under the influence.

28:15.053 --> 28:17.019
And how does his opioid use
have anything to do

28:17.021 --> 28:18.554
with why Lucas is missing?

28:18.556 --> 28:21.225
Did Lucas know his father
had a drug problem?

28:22.293 --> 28:23.759
I'm not sure.

28:23.761 --> 28:25.728
Mrs. Garza is our office manager,

28:25.730 --> 28:27.106
and we thought...

28:27.699 --> 28:29.298
She never talked about it.

28:29.300 --> 28:31.300
All right, can you think
of any reason why these boys

28:31.302 --> 28:33.803
might've stepped away
from their field trip?

28:33.805 --> 28:35.805
Young love makes kids crazy.

28:35.807 --> 28:38.374
He's a handsome, bright kid
with a dangerous health problem.

28:38.376 --> 28:39.942
She's trapped in the house with a father

28:39.944 --> 28:42.011
determined to keep them separated.

28:42.013 --> 28:44.347
They had no choice
but to fall for each other.

28:44.349 --> 28:45.915
Their friends might've even helped them

28:45.917 --> 28:47.116
run off to get married.

28:47.118 --> 28:48.751
You remember Elena, Lieutenant?

28:48.753 --> 28:51.220
I had to stop Elena
from doing that very same thing

28:51.222 --> 28:52.288
when she was 16.

28:52.290 --> 28:54.824
Little Elena. How is she?

28:54.826 --> 28:56.292
Not so little anymore...

28:56.294 --> 28:59.695
sophomore at Stanford...
physics major, full ride.

28:59.697 --> 29:01.197
Can you believe it?

29:01.199 --> 29:04.300
Now all five of them are
either in or through college.

29:04.302 --> 29:06.736
- You have five children?
- No.

29:06.738 --> 29:08.437
Five little brothers and sisters.

29:08.439 --> 29:10.906
Cami's parents were killed
by a drunk driver

29:10.908 --> 29:12.074
when she was 20.

29:12.076 --> 29:14.877
She raised all the rest of her family

29:14.879 --> 29:16.712
pretty much on her own.

29:16.714 --> 29:18.781
II'm sorry. I didn't know.

29:18.783 --> 29:21.217
Lieutenant Provenza found the asshole.

29:21.219 --> 29:23.519
Had three priors. Can you believe it?

29:23.521 --> 29:27.556
Anyway, all the Paiges
grew up happy and healthy,

29:27.558 --> 29:31.260
and they still love you, Lieutenant.

29:31.262 --> 29:33.729
And every Fourth of July,
we talk about that barbecue

29:33.731 --> 29:35.091
where your clothes caught on fire.

29:36.167 --> 29:38.100
Never seen anyone so mad at a hot dog.

29:40.538 --> 29:42.905
God. This doesn't look good.

29:47.211 --> 29:49.745
Buzz! Buzz! Keep them away from us.

29:49.747 --> 29:51.380
Yes, sir... L.A.P.D.!

29:51.382 --> 29:54.350
We are not here to talk to you,
so please just stay back,

29:54.352 --> 29:56.886
or I'm going to have to ask you
to move to the end of block.

29:56.888 --> 29:58.554
Officers, please. Thank you.

29:58.556 --> 30:00.923
We appreciate you being here.
Please, just keep moving back.

30:00.925 --> 30:03.492
Thank you.

30:14.472 --> 30:15.838
Yeah?

30:15.840 --> 30:19.041
We'd like to talk to you about
some boys who have gone missing.

30:19.043 --> 30:21.077
I'll tell you who needs to go missing...

30:21.079 --> 30:22.511
the whole Diaz family.

30:22.513 --> 30:25.186
You should be over there, getting
rid of <i>them,</i> not bothering me.

30:25.188 --> 30:27.249
Mr. Garret, we apologize
for the inconvenience,

30:27.251 --> 30:28.684
but do you mind if
we ask your daughter just...

30:28.686 --> 30:29.952
Leave Kelly out of this.

30:29.954 --> 30:32.388
And you, you rude son of a bitch,

30:32.390 --> 30:34.190
I don't want you on my property.

30:34.192 --> 30:36.258
Mr. Garret, I don't
think you understand, sir.

30:36.260 --> 30:39.528
Your neighbor's son, Miguel Diaz,

30:39.530 --> 30:41.931
is missing with two of his friends...

30:41.933 --> 30:44.500
Lucas Garza and Ryan Rojas.

30:44.502 --> 30:47.169
Now, we're just here
to canvass the neighborhood.

30:47.171 --> 30:49.505
My God. Dad, please!

30:49.507 --> 30:51.571
- We... We... We should talk to them!
- Kelly!

30:51.573 --> 30:54.009
Kelly, my name is Detective Camila Paige.

30:54.011 --> 30:55.667
Call the L.A.P.D. and ask
for me, Camila Paige...

30:55.691 --> 30:57.246
Go back to your room, young lady...

30:57.248 --> 30:59.014
- and we can talk!
- And stay there! Now!

30:59.016 --> 31:01.383
And you people,
don't come back on my property

31:01.385 --> 31:05.554
- without a warrant!
- We have three missing boys, sir.

31:05.556 --> 31:07.123
This is a crisis.

31:07.125 --> 31:08.724
You call it a crisis.

31:08.726 --> 31:10.426
I call it a good start.

31:17.602 --> 31:21.070
Cami... I appreciate your initiative,

31:21.072 --> 31:24.240
but do not go around
yelling things like "Call me"

31:24.242 --> 31:27.576
while I'm standing there
unless I say so.

31:30.784 --> 31:34.850
And neither of you open your mouths

31:34.852 --> 31:41.123
while I make this jerk's life
as hard as I possibly can.

31:42.527 --> 31:43.492
Excuse me.

31:43.494 --> 31:46.228
I am Lieutenant Provenza, L.A.P.D.,

31:46.230 --> 31:50.065
and I would like to announce
that due to his refusal

31:50.067 --> 31:52.902
to cooperate with the L.A.P.D.'s search

31:52.904 --> 31:54.770
for these missing 15 year olds,

31:54.772 --> 31:59.408
the Diaz's next door neighbor,
Mr. Marvin Garret...

31:59.410 --> 32:05.047
just became a person of interest

32:05.049 --> 32:08.317
in the case of the St. Joseph's Three.

32:08.319 --> 32:09.885
Lieutenant Provenza...

32:18.270 --> 32:19.870
<i>Does this mean the Catholic Church</i>

32:19.872 --> 32:20.937
<i>is no longer part of the investigation?</i>

32:20.939 --> 32:22.906
<i>We're not ruling out anyone,</i>

32:22.908 --> 32:25.208
<i>any place, or any organization.</i>

32:25.210 --> 32:27.711
<i>What about forced
deportation or hate crimes...</i>

32:27.713 --> 32:29.045
<i>Any possibility of these...</i>

32:29.047 --> 32:30.747
<i>I just answered that when I said</i>

32:30.749 --> 32:33.647
<i>we're not ruling</i> anything <i>out. Next.</i>

32:33.649 --> 32:35.346
<i>Is there any truth to the rumor that.</i>

32:35.348 --> 32:37.120
<i>Ryan Rojas' stepfather, Hector Padilla,</i>

32:37.122 --> 32:39.356
<i>is a courier
for the Mexican drug cartel?</i>

32:39.358 --> 32:40.857
<i>I have no idea.</i>

32:40.859 --> 32:43.126
<i>Mr. Padilla has been dead
for two months,</i>

32:43.128 --> 32:45.908
<i>so we know these boys are not with him.</i>

32:45.910 --> 32:47.731
<i>Excuse me, excuse me. That's all.</i>

32:48.774 --> 32:50.634
Lieutenant, you care to explain
why you took it upon yourself

32:50.636 --> 32:53.303
to brief the media
without permission from me?

32:53.705 --> 32:55.071
Not really.

32:57.543 --> 32:59.176
But since you ask,

32:59.178 --> 33:02.212
Marvin Garret was not
just uncooperative.

33:02.214 --> 33:04.047
He was obstructive.

33:04.049 --> 33:06.583
There are lives at stake here, Chief,

33:06.585 --> 33:08.185
and if that jerk won't talk to us,

33:08.187 --> 33:10.020
let's see how he likes the attention

33:10.022 --> 33:12.255
of some of L.A.'s finest journalists.

33:12.257 --> 33:14.925
The hunt for these boys
is an L.A.P.D. investigation,

33:14.927 --> 33:17.194
not a press opportunity,
and so you know,

33:17.196 --> 33:18.929
I was just on the phone
with Bishop Calhoun,

33:18.931 --> 33:21.398
who the press contacted
after your little briefing,

33:21.400 --> 33:23.099
and he was furious that
you didn't rule out

33:23.101 --> 33:25.168
- the Catholic Church.
- Well, how could I do that?

33:25.170 --> 33:28.438
These three 15 year olds
have a very special relationship

33:28.440 --> 33:30.106
with a priest in their school.

33:30.108 --> 33:32.509
Father Jonas <i>actively</i> tried to stop me

33:32.511 --> 33:35.145
from looking into the locker
of Ryan Rojas.

33:35.147 --> 33:37.747
I don't think Chief Mason objects to us

33:37.749 --> 33:39.482
investigating the Church, Lieutenant.

33:39.484 --> 33:44.187
I think he objects to us saying
that out loud to the media.

33:44.189 --> 33:45.922
Good luck controlling the press.

33:45.924 --> 33:47.757
We've got journalists staked out

33:47.759 --> 33:50.302
in front of every one
of the boys' homes.

33:50.327 --> 33:51.313
Typical death watch.

33:51.315 --> 33:52.429
We're not there yet, Mike.

33:52.431 --> 33:54.378
We're passed the 24hour mark...

33:54.380 --> 33:56.980
no ransom demands over our wires
and no word from the boys.

33:56.982 --> 33:59.669
And nothing on any of their
devices or their email servers,

33:59.671 --> 34:01.771
and nothing on
any socialmedia platforms.

34:01.773 --> 34:03.139
We're not at a dead end yet.

34:03.141 --> 34:05.175
The Ian NuÃ±ez brought in by Patrol is

34:05.177 --> 34:06.376
definitely Ryan's father.

34:06.378 --> 34:07.444
Wes is bringing him up.

34:07.446 --> 34:08.745
Where'd they find him?

34:08.746 --> 34:10.045
Working the counter
at his fatherinlaw's

34:10.047 --> 34:12.704
- marijuana dispensary.
- Drugs again.

34:12.706 --> 34:14.951
Mr. NuÃ±ez doesn't seem to know
what's going on with his son.

34:14.953 --> 34:16.585
According to Patrol,
he came willingly...

34:16.588 --> 34:18.728
- No questions asked.
- Why?

34:18.731 --> 34:20.123
What does he think this is about?

34:20.125 --> 34:23.025
Look, I can get her, like,
a third of the child support.

34:23.027 --> 34:25.929
That'd be, like, $20,000...
almost a third.

34:25.931 --> 34:27.630
But, I mean, there's
no reason to arrest me.

34:27.632 --> 34:29.799
That'd... That'd make it
harder on everybody.

34:29.801 --> 34:31.301
<i>If you have $20,000 in cash,</i>

34:31.303 --> 34:33.458
<i>why not just give it to your exwife?</i>

34:33.460 --> 34:36.132
<i>Because it's never enough. Yeah.</i>

34:36.135 --> 34:37.726
<i>Like, with Daniella, when I see her,</i>

34:37.728 --> 34:40.129
<i>whenever I slip her some bills,
she's all like,</i>

34:40.154 --> 34:42.254
<i>"What am I supposed to do with $500?"</i>

34:42.255 --> 34:43.588
<i>"And," Where are you?</i>

34:43.590 --> 34:44.822
<i>Why don't you ever see your son?"</i>

34:44.824 --> 34:45.858
Which is not true, because I spent

34:45.860 --> 34:47.312
two whole days with him in Disneyland.

34:47.313 --> 34:49.110
And you know what?
She didn't thank me or anything.

34:49.110 --> 34:50.511
Because you picked him up from school

34:50.513 --> 34:51.779
- without telling her?
- No.

34:51.781 --> 34:53.246
No, I'm not talking about that time.

34:53.248 --> 34:55.081
No, um, that was when he was seven.

34:55.083 --> 34:56.382
No, this is, more recent.

34:56.385 --> 34:57.451
Yeah, like,

34:57.453 --> 34:58.953
<i>II called, I set it up,</i>

34:58.955 --> 35:00.588
<i>I came to the house, I picked him up.</i>

35:00.590 --> 35:02.223
<i>Yeah, the kid had a blast.</i>

35:02.225 --> 35:03.919
<i>More recently when?</i>

35:04.160 --> 35:05.359
<i>When...</i>

35:05.361 --> 35:06.990
<i>Wow.</i>

35:06.991 --> 35:08.390
<i>That was a while back.</i>

35:08.392 --> 35:10.659
Yeah, like...
you know, Ryan was 12.

35:10.661 --> 35:12.127
But you've seen him since,
though, right...

35:12.129 --> 35:13.362
just two weeks ago?

35:13.970 --> 35:15.330
Let me jog your memory.

35:15.332 --> 35:17.866
You when to St. Joseph of Nazareth

35:17.868 --> 35:19.501
and tried to take Ryan out of class,

35:19.503 --> 35:21.370
- which caused a...
- Whoa, wow. Really?

35:21.372 --> 35:23.071
That nosey priest said all that?

35:23.073 --> 35:24.506
Okay, okay. Well, look.

35:24.508 --> 35:26.341
Let me tell you something
about Father Jonas.

35:26.343 --> 35:27.943
By all means, Ian.

35:27.945 --> 35:30.479
Tell us everything about Father Jonas.

35:30.481 --> 35:32.681
Yeah, that name keeps popping up.

35:32.683 --> 35:34.182
<i>Let me tell you the story
from the beginning.</i>

35:34.184 --> 35:36.385
I went to St. Joseph's because Ryan...

35:36.387 --> 35:38.453
he was looking me up, like, online,

35:38.455 --> 35:40.856
and he posted something
on my Facebook page.

35:40.858 --> 35:42.424
And that's a problem why?

35:42.874 --> 35:45.661
Yeah. Because...

35:45.663 --> 35:48.296
All right, look, um...

35:48.298 --> 35:50.866
I got three other kids
with my new wife, Angela.

35:50.868 --> 35:52.067
It's kind of funny.

35:52.069 --> 35:53.468
I just haven't really gotten around

35:53.470 --> 35:56.038
to telling Angie about my other son.

35:56.040 --> 35:58.106
I mean, she hasn't heard
about Ryan at all,

35:58.108 --> 36:00.008
and if she found out
on Facebook, you know...

36:00.010 --> 36:02.110
My God. Really?

36:02.112 --> 36:04.246
And just like that,
we have another suspect.

36:04.248 --> 36:06.415
At this point, who isn't a suspect?

36:06.417 --> 36:08.050
<i>On my page again,
you know, because II...</i>

36:08.052 --> 36:09.951
I can't be monitoring
my Facebook all day.

36:09.953 --> 36:12.120
He was posting shit like,
"Yo, when are you gonna

36:12.122 --> 36:13.789
"give Mom a little money," right?

36:13.791 --> 36:16.391
TThis was after, um...
Hector, he took that leap,

36:16.393 --> 36:18.293
you know, and he fell
or whatever he did, and...

36:18.295 --> 36:19.538
and they were hurting for cash.

36:19.563 --> 36:20.896
So, Ryan posted on your Facebook page,

36:20.898 --> 36:23.498
then you came to school, then you
tried to pull him from a class.

36:23.500 --> 36:25.667
Yeah, to give the little man
some money... $300.

36:25.669 --> 36:27.936
That is a lot of cash
for a 15yearold kid.

36:27.938 --> 36:29.471
And Father Jonas stopped you.

36:29.473 --> 36:31.039
Yeah, and he called the guards.

36:31.041 --> 36:32.274
He called the guards,
and he had me kicked

36:32.276 --> 36:33.675
out of the building, and for what?

36:33.677 --> 36:36.511
It ain't illegal
to offer your own kid $300.

36:36.513 --> 36:38.613
That is a good thing... a good thing.

36:38.615 --> 36:40.215
Okay, where were you yesterday

36:40.217 --> 36:41.683
between 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m.?

36:41.685 --> 36:43.245
What were you doing during those hours?

36:46.457 --> 36:47.422
Why?

36:47.424 --> 36:48.990
What's the problem, Ian?

36:48.992 --> 36:50.992
What, you don't remember where you were?

36:50.994 --> 36:52.828
No, no. Let me just... Let me just
think about that, man.

36:52.830 --> 36:54.496
So... You're just suddenly
getting in my face,

36:54.498 --> 36:55.831
asking me where I was and all that,

36:55.833 --> 36:57.866
and just, it's, like, sounding serious.

36:57.868 --> 36:59.167
It is serious, Ian.

36:59.169 --> 37:01.470
Yesterday, your son
and two of his friends

37:01.472 --> 37:04.005
went missing on a school field trip.

37:04.998 --> 37:05.915
What?

37:05.917 --> 37:07.576
Your son has disappeared, sir,
and we're trying to find him.

37:07.578 --> 37:09.411
No, no, no. He ain't disappeared, man.

37:09.413 --> 37:11.646
He just ran away from Mama
or he's probably with,

37:11.648 --> 37:13.181
- Father Jonas...
- No, he isn't.

37:13.183 --> 37:14.483
Ian, no, he isn't!

37:14.485 --> 37:16.551
We need you to tell us where you were...

37:16.553 --> 37:18.253
- Okay.
- Yesterday morning.

37:18.255 --> 37:20.489
Okay. All right. Okay.

37:20.491 --> 37:22.591
Just hold on, all right? I was, um...

37:22.593 --> 37:24.893
I was... I was hanging out
at the beach, okay?

37:24.895 --> 37:26.628
<i>Yeah, I was hanging out at the beach.</i>

37:26.630 --> 37:28.730
<i>It was my day off,
my... my wife was at work,</i>

37:28.732 --> 37:30.665
the kids were...
were with their grandparents,

37:30.667 --> 37:32.501
and, um... yeah, I was just chilling

37:32.503 --> 37:34.369
with aaa jug of mojitos at Matador.

37:34.371 --> 37:35.837
Anyone see you at Matador?

37:35.839 --> 37:37.305
You speak to anyone
while you were there?

37:37.307 --> 37:38.406
No. I was by myself.

37:38.408 --> 37:39.875
- Doing what?
- Doing what?

37:41.345 --> 37:43.678
I was just watchin' waves,
you know, laying back,

37:43.680 --> 37:44.880
reading a book.

37:44.882 --> 37:46.148
What book?

37:46.150 --> 37:47.649
"Valley of the Dolls."

37:47.651 --> 37:49.451
<i>Yeah, it was my wife's book.
I borrowed it.</i>

37:49.453 --> 37:50.719
It, sounded like fun.

37:50.721 --> 37:52.854
Who are some of the characters
in that book,

37:52.856 --> 37:54.322
"Valley of the Dolls"?

37:54.714 --> 37:56.391
Characters.

37:57.461 --> 38:00.662
- Where is she?
- Interview Room 1.

38:00.664 --> 38:02.030
I need to talk to her.

38:02.032 --> 38:03.223
Buzz.

38:04.535 --> 38:07.169
D.D.A. Hobbs
says she needs you to step

38:07.171 --> 38:09.020
<i>out into the hallway, if you can.</i>

38:09.640 --> 38:11.690
All right, Ian, you know what?

38:12.142 --> 38:14.009
We want you to sign a consent form.

38:14.011 --> 38:15.410
Let us search your house.

38:15.412 --> 38:16.812
Wait, you got to what? No. What for?

38:16.814 --> 38:18.446
What do you got to search my house for?

38:18.448 --> 38:20.448
To prepare you for
the very difficult conversation

38:20.450 --> 38:22.117
you're about to have with your wife.

38:22.119 --> 38:24.219
No. No. No way. No.

38:24.221 --> 38:26.555
You want to search my house,
you get a warrant.

38:31.528 --> 38:33.461
I've come from a meeting
at the D.A.'s office,

38:33.463 --> 38:36.231
where we've ordered bodyguards
for Emma Rios,

38:36.233 --> 38:38.033
and we're recommending them for Rusty.

38:38.035 --> 38:39.401
What?

38:39.403 --> 38:41.970
Based on a death report
of Carolyn Sayles

38:41.972 --> 38:44.739
from Scottsdale, Arizona,
age 72... What?

38:44.741 --> 38:47.509
In perfect health
until she lost her balance

38:47.511 --> 38:49.778
while hiking a canyon
and fell down 400 feet.

38:49.780 --> 38:53.515
Why is Carolyn Sayles
so important to this case?

38:53.517 --> 38:55.016
It's not <i>this</i> case.

38:55.018 --> 38:58.954
Ms. Sayles was once stepmother
to Phillip Stroh.

39:09.402 --> 39:10.635
Five deaths.

39:10.637 --> 39:13.171
Three could be coincidental.

39:13.626 --> 39:15.340
But five makes a pattern.

39:15.342 --> 39:17.041
Yes, I think so.

39:17.043 --> 39:18.798
Andrea thinks so, too.

39:19.779 --> 39:22.714
I don't get it.
Stroh made a clean getaway.

39:22.716 --> 39:25.149
No one has spotted him anywhere,
have they?

39:25.151 --> 39:29.187
No, but he's been known
to work through third parties,

39:29.189 --> 39:31.589
or in concert with them, anyway.

39:31.591 --> 39:34.592
So four accidents and a suicide

39:34.594 --> 39:38.296
equals protection
for Emma, Brenda, and me.

39:38.298 --> 39:40.698
And I may add Linda Rothman
to that list,

39:40.700 --> 39:42.667
because she was Stroh's attorney
for a while,

39:42.669 --> 39:44.669
and it didn't work out.

39:44.671 --> 39:48.339
Look, all of these deaths were
several months apart.

39:48.341 --> 39:52.677
II don't think that I need
an S.I.S. security detail yet,

39:52.679 --> 39:54.879
but, Sharon, I can't just sit back

39:54.881 --> 39:56.581
and let this happen to me again.

39:56.583 --> 39:59.339
- Meaning?
- Meaning I'd like to be...

40:00.353 --> 40:03.421
more proficient in protecting myself.

40:03.423 --> 40:06.424
More proficient in protecting yourself

40:06.426 --> 40:07.592
in what way?

40:07.594 --> 40:09.460
Sorry to interrupt,

40:09.462 --> 40:10.828
but you have to go.

40:10.830 --> 40:12.230
- I'll drive.
- I'll drive.

40:12.232 --> 40:14.198
I'm back almost 100%.

40:14.200 --> 40:15.667
Yeah, but I can't be in the field

40:15.669 --> 40:18.069
unless I'm with my commanding officer.

40:18.071 --> 40:19.571
So let me take you.

40:19.573 --> 40:20.573
"In the field"?

40:21.441 --> 40:22.570
What's happened?

40:38.925 --> 40:40.858
How long?

40:40.860 --> 40:42.760
I'm not sure. The gardener
called it in 20 minutes ago,

40:42.762 --> 40:44.228
but the body has obviously been here

40:44.230 --> 40:46.331
since sometime last night.

40:57.110 --> 40:58.509
Well...

40:58.511 --> 41:00.567
here's our diabetic.

41:02.549 --> 41:04.882
Now, what I'd like to know is...

41:04.884 --> 41:06.906
where are the other two boys?

41:07.454 --> 41:09.576
That, Lieutenant, is, um...

41:10.156 --> 41:12.290
It's an excellent question.
