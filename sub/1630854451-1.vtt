00:31.866 --> 00:34.802
<i>Once</i>
<i>it was a family of pioneers.</i>

00:39.874 --> 00:41.609
<i>They were looking</i>
<i>for a better life.</i>

00:56.858 --> 00:58.425
<i>The family came from a big city,</i>

00:59.594 --> 01:01.829
<i>but then they ran out of money</i>
<i>and they had to leave.</i>

01:09.003 --> 01:12.172
<i>There was a big sister</i>
<i>and a little sister.</i>

01:13.641 --> 01:15.677
<i>There was a mom and a dad.</i>

01:17.244 --> 01:19.179
<i>They weren't perfect.</i>

01:19.313 --> 01:20.548
<i>But they were a family.</i>

01:30.123 --> 01:31.258
<i>...and</i>
<i>are throwing in the towel.</i>

01:31.391 --> 01:33.160
<i>The indicators are right there.</i>

01:33.293 --> 01:36.396
<i>We have the highest</i>
<i>unemployment in-</i>

01:36.531 --> 01:38.332
<i>and growing segment</i>
<i>of the population</i>

01:38.465 --> 01:41.201
<i>who are taking out more</i>
<i>than they are putting in</i>

01:41.335 --> 01:44.539
<i>at a national debt</i>
<i>that outweighs our GDP.</i>

01:44.672 --> 01:48.009
<i>Folks, we are living</i>
<i>in a house of cards.</i>

01:48.141 --> 01:50.511
<i>And when the walls</i>
<i>come tumbling down...</i>

01:54.849 --> 01:59.286
Riley, we can't leave
without you.

02:00.922 --> 02:02.322
You'd never survive on your own.

02:04.058 --> 02:05.158
I would.

02:05.292 --> 02:06.426
Oh, yeah?

02:06.561 --> 02:08.029
What would you eat?

02:08.161 --> 02:09.363
Cereal.

02:09.496 --> 02:10.832
There's three boxes
in the kitchen.

02:12.567 --> 02:14.869
All right, Cap'n Crunch.
Let's roll.

02:17.071 --> 02:18.305
This is home.

02:22.275 --> 02:25.847
No, home
is where we're together.

02:29.117 --> 02:30.350
Promise?

02:57.512 --> 03:00.280
Vroom, vroom,
vroom, vroom, vroom.

03:05.019 --> 03:08.255
Vroom, vroom, vroom,
vroom, vroom.

03:10.024 --> 03:11.526
How you girls
doing back there?

03:13.161 --> 03:14.428
After we move,

03:14.562 --> 03:15.930
are you going to have a job
like before?

03:17.397 --> 03:18.933
Not right away.
You know, unless I want one.

03:20.134 --> 03:21.334
You know why?

03:21.468 --> 03:24.105
Because we're going on
an adventure.

03:24.237 --> 03:26.007
You know adventurers, right?

03:26.140 --> 03:27.374
Like a Tarzan.

03:27.508 --> 03:28.843
Yeah, sure.

03:28.976 --> 03:30.410
Yeah, like a Tarzan.

03:30.545 --> 03:31.846
I like the monkeys.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.618
Mommy...

04:16.256 --> 04:18.993
<i>People out there</i>
<i>are pissed off.</i>

04:19.127 --> 04:21.294
<i>They've lost homes, businesses,</i>

04:21.428 --> 04:23.430
<i>and they're not taking it</i>
<i>anymore.</i>

04:23.564 --> 04:24.899
<i>The phone lines are blowing up.</i>

04:25.032 --> 04:27.101
<i>Let's go to Dennis in Milwaukee.</i>
<i>What's up, man?</i>

04:27.235 --> 04:29.302
<i>Jerry, look,</i>
<i>we're going to talk about</i>

04:29.436 --> 04:30.772
<i>what the last caller was saying.</i>

04:30.905 --> 04:32.305
<i>I gotta...</i>

04:47.822 --> 04:49.223
When can I play?

04:49.356 --> 04:51.025
Never.

04:51.159 --> 04:52.527
Why?

04:52.660 --> 04:54.762
Your brain
is still little and stupid.

04:54.896 --> 04:57.297
Someday it'll grow up
and it'll work better.

04:57.430 --> 04:58.633
Riley, share with your sister.

04:58.766 --> 05:00.268
She doesn't even know
how to play.

05:00.400 --> 05:01.803
She just wants to press buttons.

05:03.470 --> 05:04.739
-Uh, excuse me.
-Yeah.

05:06.207 --> 05:09.309
Yeah. My husband and I, we split
the combo number one,

05:09.442 --> 05:10.878
but we didn't get
the hash browns

05:11.012 --> 05:12.880
since he had chose
the hash browns.

05:13.014 --> 05:14.982
Yeah, that's just
how they do it.

05:15.116 --> 05:16.584
All combos are $7.99.

05:16.717 --> 05:18.052
Doesn't really matter
if you get everything or not.

05:18.186 --> 05:19.921
I just don't want
to pay for the hash browns.

05:20.054 --> 05:21.222
Will you take it off?

05:21.354 --> 05:22.355
-Like I said, the-
-You know what?

05:22.489 --> 05:24.025
I'd love to have
the hash browns.

05:24.158 --> 05:25.226
Thank you.

05:25.358 --> 05:26.561
Be right out.

05:35.870 --> 05:37.872
Mom.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.040
Mary!

05:40.141 --> 05:41.341
Mommy, look.

05:43.778 --> 05:45.246
It's name is Cookie.

05:45.378 --> 05:46.781
Baby, you...
you can't do that, okay?

05:46.914 --> 05:48.683
I love riding her.
She's very pretty.

05:48.816 --> 05:50.383
-And I love braiding her hair.
-Okay?

05:53.287 --> 05:57.158
She comes from Unicorn Land
and she's a very rare unicorn.

05:57.291 --> 05:58.458
She's very pretty.

07:55.242 --> 07:56.476
Home.

08:40.621 --> 08:42.556
Pipe wrench.
I'll get you.

08:47.361 --> 08:48.629
What do you think?

08:48.763 --> 08:50.197
Call it a day?

08:50.331 --> 08:51.899
I'm not tired.

08:52.033 --> 08:54.402
It's because you're not the one
on top of the house.

08:54.535 --> 08:55.803
First lesson
of upper management.

08:57.004 --> 08:59.707
Respect union breaks
or the workers will strike.

09:03.177 --> 09:04.211
Thanks, hon.

09:06.714 --> 09:07.915
Hey, little monster.

09:08.049 --> 09:09.216
Get over here
and finish your food.

09:16.357 --> 09:17.625
What, you don't like it?

09:17.758 --> 09:18.859
Tomatoes are gross.

09:18.993 --> 09:21.062
What? No. They're so good.

09:27.435 --> 09:28.803
When do we go back to school?

09:34.942 --> 09:36.644
What if you don't have to?

09:38.145 --> 09:39.814
What if you could
just stay up here?

09:39.947 --> 09:41.582
Kids have to go to school.

09:44.118 --> 09:45.286
Okay.

09:46.555 --> 09:47.755
Then this is a school.

09:48.656 --> 09:49.757
What is?

09:49.890 --> 09:51.459
This cabin.

09:51.592 --> 09:55.463
It can be a school. It can be
whatever you want it to be.

09:55.596 --> 09:57.932
-Really?
-Mary likes it.

10:03.337 --> 10:06.140
If you could learn about
anything, what would it be?

10:08.409 --> 10:10.311
I like history.

10:11.779 --> 10:13.080
Then we'll learn history.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.319
Your mom and I, we had two jobs

10:18.452 --> 10:21.122
so we could buy groceries
that somebody else grew.

10:21.255 --> 10:23.057
Send you to school
where somebody else taught.

10:24.058 --> 10:25.226
And it was backwards.

10:26.994 --> 10:29.997
We make the rules now.
All four of us.

10:31.799 --> 10:33.334
<i>This place, it's just us.</i>

10:35.202 --> 10:36.170
<i>It's ours.</i>

11:08.068 --> 11:11.939
Oh. Mm.
Pew. Pew, pew. Pew. Pew.

11:17.111 --> 11:19.947
Now what?
Nothing. You exploded.

11:22.016 --> 11:23.817
When do you explode?

11:23.951 --> 11:26.020
I don't. I'm the American.

11:26.153 --> 11:27.321
You're the Taliban.

11:29.957 --> 11:31.158
Oh, okay.
One, two, three.

11:40.801 --> 11:43.370
<i>When the early pioneers</i>
<i>went west, life was hard.</i>

11:44.606 --> 11:47.074
<i>Many spent all their money</i>
<i>on the trip</i>

11:47.208 --> 11:49.611
<i>and had nothing left</i>
<i>when they got there.</i>

11:49.743 --> 11:51.178
<i>They were everyday Americans</i>

11:51.312 --> 11:54.381
<i>who risked everything</i>
<i>for an uncertain reward.</i>

11:55.816 --> 11:57.284
The frontire was a-

11:57.418 --> 11:58.986
Frontier.

11:59.119 --> 12:01.255
The I-E-R is like ear.

12:03.090 --> 12:04.992
The frontier was...

12:17.505 --> 12:19.873
Well, what do you guys
want on the flag?

12:20.007 --> 12:21.342
Can there be stars?

12:21.475 --> 12:22.409
How many?

12:22.544 --> 12:24.144
Four?

12:24.278 --> 12:26.146
Why four?

12:26.280 --> 12:27.748
Four of us.

12:29.450 --> 12:30.484
I like pirates.

12:30.619 --> 12:32.453
Like a skull and crossbones?

12:32.587 --> 12:34.455
No, no, no!

12:34.589 --> 12:36.457
Your sister is afraid
of skeletons.

12:36.591 --> 12:38.225
You said
it could be anything.

12:38.359 --> 12:40.394
Anything that doesn't
involve skeletons or the undead.

12:42.863 --> 12:44.131
Sharks.

12:51.839 --> 12:52.973
Sharks we can do.

13:04.753 --> 13:07.054
<i>You look like a man</i>
<i>with a question.</i>

13:07.187 --> 13:09.223
<i>What does that look like?</i>

13:09.356 --> 13:14.228
Hmm. Pensive, squinty eyes,
maybe a little constipated.

13:14.361 --> 13:15.429
Really?

13:19.366 --> 13:20.901
Are you okay?

13:21.035 --> 13:22.336
Better than okay.

13:26.040 --> 13:28.042
Do you think this place
is good for you?

13:28.175 --> 13:29.577
Is it, is it helping?

13:33.113 --> 13:34.348
Hmm.
I love you.

13:34.481 --> 13:35.482
And I love you, too.

14:01.241 --> 14:02.610
Spotted a base command.

14:02.744 --> 14:04.078
We have eyes on target.

14:04.211 --> 14:06.146
Be advised. He has a weapon.

14:06.280 --> 14:08.683
May need air support. Over.

14:35.610 --> 14:36.644
Good afternoon.

14:37.812 --> 14:38.946
You got a minute?

14:39.079 --> 14:40.414
I'm with Building and Safety.

14:42.751 --> 14:45.919
I was up here for an inspection
three or four years back.

14:47.488 --> 14:49.089
The place was already
in foreclosure then

14:49.223 --> 14:51.091
but it looked like hell.

14:51.225 --> 14:52.761
Yeah, I found some
spare lumber around the place,

14:52.893 --> 14:54.294
you know, fixed what I could.

14:56.029 --> 14:57.264
Power come off the grid?

14:57.398 --> 14:58.966
Yep.
Hoping to go solar, though.

14:59.834 --> 15:01.034
Phone?

15:01.168 --> 15:03.103
Uh, old landline hookup.

15:03.237 --> 15:05.005
And where's your septic?

15:07.174 --> 15:08.475
Uh... over there, I think.

15:14.582 --> 15:16.518
Yeah.

15:16.651 --> 15:18.051
You smell that?

15:18.185 --> 15:20.053
You got a leak.

15:20.187 --> 15:21.188
You're gonna need
to dig out the tank,

15:21.321 --> 15:23.390
patch it, maybe replace.

15:26.728 --> 15:28.028
Come on.

15:28.162 --> 15:30.464
You've got farms in the valley.

15:30.598 --> 15:32.266
County considers
cross-contamination

15:32.399 --> 15:34.001
to be an E. coli risk.

15:35.169 --> 15:37.037
Previous owner probably
got grandfathered in.

15:38.038 --> 15:39.940
I... I got to dig it out myself?

15:40.073 --> 15:41.475
You got a winch?

15:41.609 --> 15:43.611
-No.
-You're going to need a winch.

15:46.815 --> 15:48.081
It's bullshit.

15:48.215 --> 15:50.284
No, that is your shit

15:50.417 --> 15:52.219
running into the county's
water table.

15:59.159 --> 16:00.360
Fuck's sake!

16:12.139 --> 16:13.508
What do you think
they look like?

16:13.641 --> 16:15.108
Do you think
that they're yellow?

16:15.242 --> 16:16.711
You think they're orange?

16:16.845 --> 16:19.714
How do you not know
what a monkey looks like?

16:45.807 --> 16:47.040
Mary!

16:54.849 --> 16:58.252
Mary! Mary!

17:00.522 --> 17:02.256
Mary!

17:02.389 --> 17:05.527
She said there weren't,
but I think I found one.

17:05.660 --> 17:07.562
Have you seen any in the trees?

17:08.763 --> 17:11.031
I think they only come out
at night.

17:11.164 --> 17:12.734
And that's why
nobody's seen them.

17:16.871 --> 17:18.138
Is she with you?

17:22.142 --> 17:23.377
I'm Eric.

17:25.947 --> 17:27.615
Riley.

17:27.749 --> 17:29.684
Well, Riley,

17:29.817 --> 17:32.520
you gonna give her
the bad news about the monkeys?

17:32.654 --> 17:34.154
Or am I gonna have
to be the one?

17:39.761 --> 17:41.361
So it's a night
before Thanksgiving.

17:41.495 --> 17:42.830
We got some family
coming into town.

17:42.964 --> 17:45.800
So Susie cooks up everything
the day before,

17:45.934 --> 17:49.971
the bird, mashed potatoes,
cornbread, that works.

17:50.103 --> 17:52.439
That night I wake up,

17:52.574 --> 17:55.510
I hear this crashing
coming from downstairs.

17:55.643 --> 17:57.645
It's like a marching band's
moving in.

17:57.779 --> 17:59.547
Now I just figured
it was Susie, right?

17:59.681 --> 18:03.383
Figured she was putting the last
minute touches on the meal.

18:04.886 --> 18:06.654
Then I hear this deep,

18:06.788 --> 18:11.224
deep grumbling inches
from the back of my neck.

18:12.961 --> 18:14.161
Oh. Was it a monster?

18:14.294 --> 18:16.731
It was worse.

18:16.864 --> 18:18.866
It was Susie snoring.

18:20.133 --> 18:21.101
I do not.

18:29.376 --> 18:32.080
So then I go downstairs, right?

18:32.212 --> 18:34.682
The fridge is wide open,
and I kid you not,

18:34.816 --> 18:37.217
there is this guy
gorging his face,

18:37.351 --> 18:39.020
going to town on Susie's food.

18:39.186 --> 18:42.422
And I'm like, "Hey, buddy,
that's our Thanksgiving dinner."

18:42.557 --> 18:44.324
Well, what did he say?

18:44.458 --> 18:46.694
"The neighbor's food
was better."

18:47.962 --> 18:49.864
He's like, "The neighbor's
food was better."

18:49.998 --> 18:51.733
"Get the hell out of my house."

18:53.935 --> 18:56.671
Yeah. That's when we decided
that Tampa wasn't for us.

18:56.804 --> 18:57.872
Too many lunatics.

18:58.006 --> 18:59.741
Those people
should be permanently locked up,

18:59.874 --> 19:01.174
as far as I'm concerned.

19:02.744 --> 19:04.579
- Bourbon?
- Oh, yes.

19:05.880 --> 19:07.081
Hey, old man.

19:07.214 --> 19:09.851
Pour me up a tall one
on the rocks.

19:11.586 --> 19:12.954
Have you all seen
the bear that's been

19:13.087 --> 19:14.421
roaming around here?

19:16.057 --> 19:18.059
You walk all the way
down to the creek.

19:18.191 --> 19:19.226
There's a little waterfall,
but you-

19:19.359 --> 19:20.695
Guns are bad.

19:24.832 --> 19:29.570
Well, uh, guns can be bad,
but if it's used correctly,

19:29.704 --> 19:32.272
it's just a tool,
like a screwdriver.

19:32.406 --> 19:33.908
Or like a pipe wrench.

19:35.877 --> 19:36.911
That too.

19:46.921 --> 19:48.890
I'm sorry if I made anyone
feel uncomfortable.

19:49.023 --> 19:51.826
I'm used to carrying it
everywhere.

19:51.959 --> 19:53.226
I'm sorry.

19:53.360 --> 19:54.696
Nah. We're a bunch
of city folk talking.

19:57.699 --> 19:59.299
<i>We made a mistake, babe.</i>
<i>We're going home.</i>

19:59.433 --> 20:01.536
<i>The girls</i>
<i>are having fun out here.</i>

20:01.669 --> 20:04.371
<i>I like it, and I think</i>
<i>it's great to be up here.</i>

20:04.505 --> 20:05.773
Is Mom okay?

20:05.907 --> 20:07.441
<i>And we do not</i>
<i>have to deal</i>

20:07.575 --> 20:09.177
<i>with the real world right now,</i>
<i>okay?</i>

20:09.309 --> 20:10.745
<i>That is the best for you.</i>
<i>We moved up here for you.</i>

20:10.878 --> 20:12.680
- <i>You understand that?</i>
-She'll be fine.

20:12.814 --> 20:14.481
<i>We're nothing</i>
<i>like these peoples!</i>

20:15.683 --> 20:16.651
<i>We're going back...</i>

20:16.784 --> 20:18.351
She'll be better in the morning.

20:18.485 --> 20:19.921
<i>We're going</i>
<i>to figure it out.</i>

20:24.192 --> 20:26.627
Do you think
Eric kills people with his gun?

20:29.931 --> 20:30.998
Probably.

20:32.667 --> 20:34.702
How many?

20:34.836 --> 20:36.771
Ten.

20:36.904 --> 20:38.005
Really?

20:39.674 --> 20:41.109
Yeah.

20:41.241 --> 20:43.010
Shot them right in the head.

20:43.144 --> 20:45.345
I mean, their brains explode
like spaghetti.

20:47.380 --> 20:48.883
I don't think he kills anyone.

21:12.740 --> 21:14.341
You can fix it, right?

21:15.243 --> 21:17.277
Yeah.

21:24.118 --> 21:25.753
Motherfucker!

21:31.491 --> 21:33.326
Fucking winch!

21:33.460 --> 21:34.996
Where am I going
to find a fucking winch?

21:45.472 --> 21:46.808
Remember
what we talked about.

21:48.976 --> 21:49.944
You take a breath.

21:51.411 --> 21:55.016
Exhale slowly.

21:58.085 --> 21:59.887
And whenever you're ready.

22:05.993 --> 22:07.061
Ha-ha! Nice shot.

22:09.530 --> 22:10.832
You're a natural.

22:23.343 --> 22:24.979
Look, uh,
it's none of my business,

22:25.112 --> 22:27.582
so you just tell me
to fuck right off

22:27.715 --> 22:28.916
if I'm overstepping.

22:30.518 --> 22:32.086
Is Alice okay with her
being out here?

22:34.021 --> 22:37.390
Yeah. Yeah, she's okay.
She's... she's fine.

22:44.065 --> 22:45.432
Alice is bipolar.

22:48.703 --> 22:50.638
A year ago, she was teaching
elementary school and...

22:51.772 --> 22:53.174
she had an episode

22:53.307 --> 22:55.643
and she thought a student
was somebody they weren't.

22:56.777 --> 22:58.112
And it was pretty bad.

22:59.180 --> 23:00.447
She...

23:00.581 --> 23:01.782
She just needs some time off.

23:01.916 --> 23:03.985
Get some rest.
Get her mind right.

23:04.118 --> 23:05.620
I mean, they put her
on this medication

23:05.753 --> 23:07.420
and it helps for a while,

23:07.555 --> 23:08.789
but she always gets worse.

23:11.525 --> 23:13.928
But up here, she seems good.

23:14.061 --> 23:15.129
You know?

23:15.263 --> 23:17.632
I think this is a really
good place for her.

23:17.765 --> 23:19.399
She's happy. We're happy.

23:47.228 --> 23:48.596
Chin up.

23:48.729 --> 23:50.631
You'll be a family
of mountain men in no time.

23:52.099 --> 23:53.634
Pioneers.

23:53.768 --> 23:55.970
Yeah.
We have all the help we can get.

24:06.213 --> 24:07.515
Do you have a winch?

24:09.917 --> 24:12.320
-Sweetheart, don't bother-
-I don't.

24:12.452 --> 24:14.454
But I might know
someone who does.

24:19.560 --> 24:20.795
I... I may need a favor.

24:33.774 --> 24:35.076
All right. How does it look?

24:35.209 --> 24:36.177
Is it tight?

24:36.310 --> 24:37.578
- Yep.
- Okay.

24:39.246 --> 24:41.148
I figure you can plug
that leak with a can of sealer

24:41.282 --> 24:42.683
and drop it
in the ground up there.

24:42.817 --> 24:43.985
Mr. Danik,
I can't say how much...

24:44.118 --> 24:46.087
Oh, Mr. Danik?
Mr. Danik's my dad.

24:46.220 --> 24:47.355
Come on, Steve, man.

24:47.487 --> 24:48.823
-All right, Steve.
-We're neighbors.

24:48.956 --> 24:50.324
Yeah. You'd do
the same thing for me, right?

24:50.458 --> 24:51.759
Yeah, of course.

24:51.892 --> 24:53.361
You're a real badass
motherfucker, aren't you?

24:53.493 --> 24:54.762
You're the real deal.

24:56.530 --> 24:57.999
We're a dying breed up here.

24:59.066 --> 25:01.969
Hey, Lana, you want to operate
the winch.

25:02.103 --> 25:03.738
Wait. Seriously?

25:03.871 --> 25:05.639
Hell no. He's not serious.

25:08.342 --> 25:09.310
Come on.
You want a beer?

25:09.443 --> 25:10.745
-Yeah.
-Let's go.

25:15.950 --> 25:17.685
Squeeze the trigger.
Don't yank it.

25:18.552 --> 25:19.854
All right.

25:22.490 --> 25:23.691
Then what?

25:23.824 --> 25:24.992
It's going to kick you
in the shoulders,

25:25.126 --> 25:26.093
so keep it tight.

25:26.227 --> 25:27.661
Kick?

25:27.795 --> 25:29.697
You're going to want
to keep... keep it right...

25:29.830 --> 25:30.898
keep the butt right up in there.

25:31.032 --> 25:32.199
All right.
Yeah.

25:41.242 --> 25:42.910
Oh! That hurts.

25:43.044 --> 25:44.745
You got something
that doesn't rip your arm off?

25:44.879 --> 25:46.814
That thing's got more recoil
than a 12-gauge.

25:46.947 --> 25:49.650
So it'll be smooth sailing
after this.

25:49.784 --> 25:51.886
Gave our daughter one
when she turned seven.

25:52.019 --> 25:54.488
Dumbass kid shot right next
to her brother's head.

25:54.622 --> 25:56.257
Still can't hear us
half the time.

25:57.958 --> 25:59.860
<i>What did your dad do?</i>

25:59.994 --> 26:02.997
He used to work
at a mine, but he got fired.

26:03.130 --> 26:04.231
Now?

26:04.365 --> 26:07.301
I don't know,
he's like a farmer, I think.

26:08.537 --> 26:09.737
That's pretty good.

26:10.838 --> 26:12.873
My family's rich as shit.

26:13.007 --> 26:15.443
We just live up here because
we like hunting and fishing.

26:15.576 --> 26:18.612
Could probably even live
in Beverly Hills if we wanted.

26:18.746 --> 26:20.347
Have a pool or something.

26:20.481 --> 26:22.383
We used to have a pool.

26:22.517 --> 26:24.051
I'm talking about a real pool.

26:24.185 --> 26:27.121
Not your family's
weak-ass pool.

26:27.254 --> 26:28.722
Should we go back?

26:30.458 --> 26:32.093
You scared?

26:32.226 --> 26:34.428
I'm trying to show you
the big dog shit.

26:34.563 --> 26:35.796
You a big dog?

26:37.364 --> 26:38.966
I think so.

26:39.100 --> 26:40.334
Good.

26:53.714 --> 26:54.915
Cool place.

26:55.049 --> 26:57.017
Yeah, it's pretty sweet.

26:57.151 --> 26:58.452
Thinking about putting
an ice machine

26:58.587 --> 26:59.753
in over there for the summer.

27:01.722 --> 27:03.525
What do you do in here?

27:03.657 --> 27:05.059
Adult shit.

27:17.004 --> 27:18.305
You're clinging it!

27:19.673 --> 27:21.709
Be careful with the pages. Okay?

27:23.545 --> 27:24.778
Okay.

27:27.549 --> 27:29.316
I drink my dad's beer sometimes.

27:37.491 --> 27:39.260
We should go back.

27:39.393 --> 27:40.595
Why?

27:40.728 --> 27:42.696
I think I may be heard
somebody yelling,

27:42.830 --> 27:44.064
so we should go back.

27:45.232 --> 27:46.568
If you didn't want
to hang out with me,

27:46.700 --> 27:47.835
you should've just said so.

27:50.404 --> 27:51.405
It's just...

27:52.706 --> 27:53.974
I... I don't want to drink it.

27:56.143 --> 27:57.378
I thought
we could be friends.

27:57.512 --> 27:58.746
We can.

27:58.879 --> 28:00.114
Drink it.

28:01.583 --> 28:04.218
You gotta drink! Drink it!

28:05.686 --> 28:08.422
Hey! Get back here!

28:13.827 --> 28:15.296
You said you're a big dog.

28:21.135 --> 28:22.637
I'm sorry I didn't do that.

28:22.770 --> 28:24.639
- I didn't do that, okay?
- Riley!

28:24.772 --> 28:25.806
- Okay?
- Hey, what's up?

28:25.940 --> 28:28.008
-What's going on?
-Riley.

28:28.142 --> 28:29.611
- Are you okay? Yeah?
- I'm so sorry.

28:29.743 --> 28:31.580
I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to.
It was an accident.

28:31.712 --> 28:34.281
I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry.

28:34.415 --> 28:36.116
You shouldn't move.
You shouldn't move.

28:36.250 --> 28:37.686
It's okay.
Let me take care of her.

28:37.818 --> 28:39.186
I just want to see you.

28:39.320 --> 28:40.854
I just want you to move for me.
Just move it.

28:40.988 --> 28:42.856
How's that?
Yeah, it hurts a little? Okay.

28:42.990 --> 28:44.225
All right. Well, you know what?

28:44.358 --> 28:45.560
Looks like you wrenched
a little bit,

28:45.694 --> 28:46.628
but I think you're going
to live.

28:46.760 --> 28:48.162
Riley.

28:48.295 --> 28:49.496
What's going on? What happened?

28:49.631 --> 28:50.965
Mom.

28:52.866 --> 28:54.301
Oh, God. Are you okay?
Oh, baby.

28:55.369 --> 28:56.504
I'm sorry,
it was an accident.

28:56.638 --> 28:58.038
It was an accident.

28:58.172 --> 29:00.140
What did she do to you?
Why would she hurt you?

29:00.274 --> 29:01.108
It's okay.

29:01.242 --> 29:02.711
What did you do to her?

29:02.843 --> 29:04.778
I'm sorry. It was an accident.
We were just playing.

29:04.912 --> 29:06.313
This is not playing.

29:07.815 --> 29:08.916
What did you do?

29:09.049 --> 29:09.850
I'm sorry,
it was an accident.

29:09.984 --> 29:11.051
I'm sorry.

29:11.185 --> 29:13.220
What did you do?
What did you do?

29:16.290 --> 29:18.492
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Honey, honey, honey, honey.

29:18.627 --> 29:21.028
Honey, honey. Honey, cut it out.

29:22.496 --> 29:23.732
Honey. Hey, look at me.
Look at me.

29:23.864 --> 29:25.799
Hey, look at me.
Look at me.

29:28.836 --> 29:31.038
It's okay. It's okay.
Look, she's okay.

29:31.171 --> 29:32.439
All right. Look at her.

29:32.574 --> 29:33.941
- I'm so sorry.
- She's okay. Look at me.

29:34.074 --> 29:36.310
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean it.

29:44.118 --> 29:46.854
-I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
-Hey, stop crying!

29:46.987 --> 29:48.989
Okay? Enough.

29:50.958 --> 29:52.393
Sorry this happened.

29:52.527 --> 29:53.927
Yeah. We'll make it up
to you somehow.

29:54.061 --> 29:55.630
And she's going to be...

29:55.764 --> 29:56.698
it's going to be okay, so.

29:56.830 --> 29:58.032
It's okay. She's okay.

29:59.233 --> 30:01.569
-She's not okay.
-She's okay. Look at her.

30:01.703 --> 30:03.070
-She's fine.
-She's not okay.

30:03.203 --> 30:04.238
Come on.

30:10.745 --> 30:11.912
Riley, let's go.

30:25.159 --> 30:26.827
<i>Mom is sick.</i>

30:26.960 --> 30:28.162
<i>Like a cold?</i>

30:30.464 --> 30:32.701
<i>She got like this before.</i>

30:32.833 --> 30:34.502
<i>You don't remember.</i>

30:34.636 --> 30:37.572
<i>I remember.</i>
<i>Dad took her to the doctor.</i>

30:39.139 --> 30:40.608
<i>Then she was Mom again.</i>

30:42.544 --> 30:43.944
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>Dad's going to take her</i>

30:44.078 --> 30:45.212
<i>to the doctor this time.</i>

30:46.715 --> 30:48.817
<i>It's different than before.</i>

30:48.949 --> 30:50.384
<i>Is Dad sick too?</i>

30:52.754 --> 30:54.321
<i>No.</i>

30:54.455 --> 30:55.489
<i>Just different.</i>

30:58.593 --> 31:01.128
<i>And I feel like</i>
<i>it's been so long.</i>

31:01.261 --> 31:04.465
When was the last time
that... that I saw you?

31:05.667 --> 31:07.000
My kids are older now.

31:07.134 --> 31:09.470
You have to see them
before you go.

31:09.604 --> 31:11.573
You just don't know
where they go off to.

31:12.940 --> 31:14.341
Hmm.

31:15.976 --> 31:17.144
I'm here.

31:17.277 --> 31:18.546
You know, the kids.

31:20.447 --> 31:22.584
They're growing up so fast.

31:22.717 --> 31:27.154
You just turn around one day
and boom, they're little people.

31:28.956 --> 31:30.725
It's me.

31:30.859 --> 31:32.126
I'm here.

31:39.701 --> 31:40.934
Mary?

31:42.670 --> 31:43.971
I thought...

31:47.675 --> 31:48.976
Of course it's you.

31:51.011 --> 31:53.213
Of course it's you.

31:54.948 --> 31:56.283
I'm so sorry, babe.

31:58.586 --> 31:59.621
That's okay.

32:23.912 --> 32:26.280
I built this shit myself.
This is my only child.

32:26.413 --> 32:28.583
This is my only child.
Fuck those other kids.

32:28.716 --> 32:32.252
This is a serious motherfucking
weapon of war right here, buddy.

32:47.635 --> 32:48.770
No.

32:53.273 --> 32:54.576
It's pretty cool
that your parents

32:54.709 --> 32:55.743
let you hang out late.

32:58.145 --> 32:59.547
Push the sides in, dumb fuck.

33:01.281 --> 33:02.449
I brought the spray.

33:03.383 --> 33:05.185
Trying to get fucked up or what?

33:06.688 --> 33:07.689
You going in?

33:08.823 --> 33:10.123
Yeah. I will.

33:10.257 --> 33:12.092
Hey, I'll beat your ass.

33:12.226 --> 33:14.127
Take it easy.
We're just fucking around.

33:18.131 --> 33:19.233
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, wait, wait.

33:19.366 --> 33:20.835
Are you serious?
What?

33:20.969 --> 33:22.537
Huffing,

33:22.670 --> 33:24.404
that's old school.

33:24.539 --> 33:26.541
Best high is to take it
direct, the rag just dilutes it.

33:26.674 --> 33:27.542
Everyone knows that.

33:27.675 --> 33:30.778
- Since when?
- Since always.

33:30.912 --> 33:32.212
Look, you want to get blasted,

33:32.346 --> 33:33.615
ditch the rag
and stick it right in here.

33:38.185 --> 33:39.286
Fine, man. If you're too much
of a pussy,

33:39.419 --> 33:40.522
let daddy do it for you.

33:40.655 --> 33:41.656
Fuck off!

33:54.468 --> 33:55.737
Fuck you, man!

34:02.142 --> 34:03.811
Fuck you!

34:06.014 --> 34:07.347
You're so stupid.

34:17.224 --> 34:18.593
Dad.

34:18.726 --> 34:19.894
Is Mom okay?

34:20.028 --> 34:22.162
Yeah, Mom's fine.

34:22.296 --> 34:23.497
She's just tired.

34:23.631 --> 34:24.766
You know how she gets
when she's tired.

34:26.366 --> 34:28.335
It's not easy taking care
of everyone all the time.

34:32.072 --> 34:33.975
Should she go to a doctor?

34:34.107 --> 34:35.409
Mom doesn't need a doctor.

34:36.911 --> 34:37.912
She just needs rest.

34:38.046 --> 34:39.714
She'll be good, I promise you.

34:46.788 --> 34:48.188
Mom?

34:51.559 --> 34:52.627
Mom?

34:59.499 --> 35:01.134
<i>When they got here,</i>

35:01.268 --> 35:04.438
<i>they were over 500 native tribes</i>
<i>already in the United States.</i>

35:04.572 --> 35:06.306
But as white
settlers moved west,

35:06.440 --> 35:08.342
violence increased
between these newcomers

35:08.475 --> 35:09.911
and the local tribes.

35:10.044 --> 35:12.914
In 1800, the Indian population
of the United States

35:13.047 --> 35:14.749
was roughly 600,000.

35:14.882 --> 35:18.285
But by 1890,
it had dropped to only 250,000.

35:18.418 --> 35:19.721
Where did they go?

35:22.189 --> 35:23.925
They died.

35:24.058 --> 35:25.093
Why?

35:25.225 --> 35:26.527
We killed them.

35:27.962 --> 35:29.697
Riley, your sister doesn't-

35:29.831 --> 35:31.131
It's true.

35:32.265 --> 35:33.568
Your sister doesn't like that.

35:38.640 --> 35:40.173
The remaining Indian tribes

35:40.307 --> 35:41.576
had the lands taken from them

35:41.709 --> 35:43.377
and were forced
onto reservations

35:43.511 --> 35:45.947
where thousands more died
of starvation and-

35:46.080 --> 35:47.447
Riley.

35:53.121 --> 35:54.488
Why did they kill them?

36:06.299 --> 36:07.535
Mom.

36:26.821 --> 36:27.889
Riley.

36:29.724 --> 36:31.224
Did you take out
one of these pages?

36:36.898 --> 36:41.368
It's okay if you did.
You can tell me the truth.

36:47.175 --> 36:48.375
No more school today.

37:22.309 --> 37:23.511
You look cool.

<i>buttholes and vaginas</i>

38:18.199 --> 38:19.734
<i>that happened a long time ago.</i>

38:19.867 --> 38:22.469
In the past, adults used
to dress in shitty -

38:22.603 --> 38:23.838
and kids...

38:53.501 --> 38:56.671
Mom, I need a shirt.

38:59.540 --> 39:00.875
They're
in the washing machine.

39:05.880 --> 39:07.582
We don't have a washing machine.

39:09.717 --> 39:11.085
That was at the old house.

39:15.256 --> 39:16.657
What are you talking about?

39:19.392 --> 39:20.628
Never mind.

39:22.230 --> 39:23.463
I'm sorry.

39:40.548 --> 39:41.749
What are you doing?

39:44.652 --> 39:46.486
Being a worm.

39:46.621 --> 39:48.055
That's fucking stupid.

39:53.194 --> 39:54.394
Let's go, dear both.

39:56.197 --> 39:57.832
Where's Mom?

39:57.965 --> 39:59.432
She's not coming.

39:59.567 --> 40:00.835
How do you know?

40:13.614 --> 40:14.949
Hardware?

40:15.082 --> 40:16.183
Down on 12th.

40:34.502 --> 40:36.938
-What are you doing?
-oShut up.

40:37.238 --> 40:38.940
Riley!

40:40.942 --> 40:42.777
-Give it.
-Hey, let go.

40:42.910 --> 40:44.578
No! Mom would let me have it.

40:44.712 --> 40:46.047
Mom's not here!

40:47.148 --> 40:50.017
Hey. Is everything
cool back here?

40:51.252 --> 40:52.520
Riley won't share.

40:56.691 --> 40:58.458
Looks like there's enough
to go around.

41:07.835 --> 41:09.103
Share with your sister.

41:11.372 --> 41:12.606
It's on me.

41:16.777 --> 41:18.579
So, haven't seen you two before.

41:19.847 --> 41:22.049
We live on the mountain.

41:22.183 --> 41:23.451
The mountain.

41:23.584 --> 41:24.885
That sounds like fun.

41:25.019 --> 41:27.254
Yeah, sometimes it's boring.

41:27.388 --> 41:30.157
There aren't any other kids
except for this one girl,

41:30.291 --> 41:31.525
but she hurt Riley.

41:33.227 --> 41:34.261
Are you okay?

41:36.831 --> 41:39.400
My mom hit the other girl
right in the face.

41:39.533 --> 41:40.935
Mary.

41:48.042 --> 41:49.777
Everyone's okay.

41:49.910 --> 41:51.245
My mom didn't hurt anybody.

41:54.382 --> 41:56.317
My mom is scary sometimes.

41:56.450 --> 41:57.818
Shut up!

42:01.389 --> 42:03.724
When I was your age,
my parents would fight.

42:05.326 --> 42:06.527
And it was scary.

42:09.096 --> 42:11.065
And sometimes
they would hit people, too.

42:15.369 --> 42:16.904
Does your Mom hurt you?

42:18.305 --> 42:19.607
You can talk to me.

42:20.841 --> 42:22.877
It's fine. We need to go.

42:23.778 --> 42:25.646
Mary, let's go.

42:27.648 --> 42:29.150
It's okay to ask for help.

42:31.152 --> 42:32.753
What the fuck
do you think you're doing?

42:34.523 --> 42:35.723
Get away from them.

42:39.427 --> 42:40.995
We were talking about Mom.

42:42.696 --> 42:44.598
Girls, in the car.

42:44.732 --> 42:45.900
- But we were-
- Now!

42:56.143 --> 42:57.611
<i>What did you tell her</i>
<i>about your mom?</i>

42:57.745 --> 42:58.979
<i>I didn't tell her</i>
<i>anything.</i>

43:46.093 --> 43:47.596
It's like Reagan, man.

43:47.728 --> 43:49.029
Remember Reagan? He said,

43:49.163 --> 43:51.732
"Be as a shining city
on the hill." Right?

43:53.602 --> 43:55.336
And he fucking got that shit
from the Bible.

43:55.469 --> 43:57.572
But he said it best.

43:57.705 --> 43:59.073
God, fucking badass.

43:59.206 --> 44:01.610
City on a hill, I like that.

44:01.742 --> 44:03.043
-You're on it.
-Yeah.

44:03.177 --> 44:04.845
We're the shining city
on the hill, right?

44:04.979 --> 44:07.181
That's us, dude.
That's fucking us.

44:07.314 --> 44:08.749
-That's what we're doing.
-Yeah.

44:08.883 --> 44:10.552
And they don't fucking get it.

44:10.684 --> 44:11.553
-Yeah. Who?
-Huh?

44:11.685 --> 44:12.753
Who?

44:12.887 --> 44:15.990
The fucking uptight elites.

44:18.759 --> 44:20.794
Wait.
Are you fucking listening to me?

44:22.930 --> 44:24.431
You gotta fucking breathe.

45:33.901 --> 45:35.302
I'm sorry.

45:38.339 --> 45:39.674
I don't know
what's happening to me.

45:39.807 --> 45:41.610
Oh, baby.

45:41.742 --> 45:42.843
I need a doctor.

45:42.977 --> 45:44.278
Hey, who's going
to pay for that?

45:44.411 --> 45:45.946
I mean, this place
is good for you.

45:46.080 --> 45:47.815
Now, you said
you were good here.

45:47.948 --> 45:49.416
You said it was helping.

47:28.115 --> 47:29.551
What are you guys doing?

47:29.684 --> 47:30.884
Are your parents home?

47:35.790 --> 47:37.458
-Can I help you?
-Mr. Hayes.

47:37.592 --> 47:39.093
I'm Loraine Miller.

47:39.226 --> 47:41.161
I'm with the Department
of Child and Family Services.

47:43.397 --> 47:44.699
Okay.

47:44.833 --> 47:48.469
We've received a child
welfare report for your family.

47:48.603 --> 47:49.604
A report from who?

47:51.004 --> 47:52.373
May we come in?

48:12.226 --> 48:14.629
And do either of you
have a criminal record?

48:15.663 --> 48:17.064
No.

48:18.198 --> 48:20.568
Do you discipline
your children?

48:20.702 --> 48:21.969
No.

48:24.806 --> 48:26.173
I mean, yes.

48:26.306 --> 48:30.144
I mean, if they're bad,
but we don't hit them.

48:30.277 --> 48:31.646
I mean, are you asking
if we hit our children?

48:34.948 --> 48:36.551
These are just
standard questions.

48:38.986 --> 48:40.020
If your children are injured,

48:40.154 --> 48:41.623
do you have contingencies
in place

48:41.756 --> 48:43.023
for their medical care?

48:44.324 --> 48:45.627
Yeah. We have a first aid kit.

48:52.667 --> 48:53.934
May I see it?

48:55.603 --> 48:57.004
Sure.

49:11.485 --> 49:12.821
Do you have a copy
of your children's

49:12.953 --> 49:14.254
current school records?

49:20.127 --> 49:22.162
Uh, we homeschool our children.

49:22.296 --> 49:24.264
My wife's a teacher,
professionally.

49:25.199 --> 49:26.935
Oh, you're licensed?

49:27.067 --> 49:28.101
Yeah, she's credentialed
in California.

49:28.235 --> 49:29.571
I'm sorry, sir.

49:29.704 --> 49:31.706
I'd like her to answer,
if that's all right.

49:41.048 --> 49:42.316
Ma'am.

49:48.055 --> 49:49.256
I was credentialed

49:49.389 --> 49:51.425
with the California Board
of Education,

49:51.559 --> 49:53.761
but that lapsed
during a leave of absence.

49:53.895 --> 49:56.330
I do still have my early
childhood credential, though.

49:57.765 --> 49:58.766
Would you like to see it?

50:03.237 --> 50:04.506
That would be helpful.

50:05.907 --> 50:08.275
Quite a few families
up here homeschool.

50:08.408 --> 50:10.377
Normally, though,
we have standardized reporting

50:10.512 --> 50:13.781
and benchmarks that we expect
parents to provide annually.

50:15.717 --> 50:16.684
Hmm. Of course.

50:18.218 --> 50:20.487
Yeah. Yeah. Found it.

50:21.856 --> 50:23.290
Okay.

50:27.695 --> 50:29.631
I'm going to need to speak
to your children in private.

50:29.764 --> 50:32.099
Is there somewhere
we can do that?

50:38.873 --> 50:40.274
And what's this a picture of?

50:42.042 --> 50:43.645
A turtle with no shell.

50:45.445 --> 50:46.748
Hmm. That's very creative.

50:49.717 --> 50:52.085
You need to know that it's okay
to be honest with me.

50:53.788 --> 50:55.188
Are we in trouble?

50:56.290 --> 50:57.525
Nobody's in trouble.

51:01.428 --> 51:02.697
Then, why are you here?

51:03.898 --> 51:05.800
I'm here to help. That's it.

51:08.101 --> 51:09.537
What does that mean?

51:09.671 --> 51:12.006
It means that I'm here to do
whatever I can

51:12.139 --> 51:14.676
to help your parents
make this the best home for you

51:14.809 --> 51:16.143
that it can possibly be.

51:25.319 --> 51:27.087
Have you helped lots of people?

51:31.059 --> 51:32.225
I have.

51:37.665 --> 51:38.733
Riley.

51:39.834 --> 51:42.135
Is there something
you need to tell me?

51:53.180 --> 51:54.448
Does it always take this long?
Can I speak to you outside?

52:16.738 --> 52:18.171
What did you guys talk about?

52:20.008 --> 52:21.208
What did she say?

52:24.979 --> 52:26.279
She's going to help.

52:27.381 --> 52:28.783
How is she going to help?

52:32.954 --> 52:34.221
Riley!

52:35.123 --> 52:36.624
She's going to help mom.

52:40.193 --> 52:41.328
Riley, whatever you told her,

52:41.461 --> 52:42.730
you have to tell her
that it's a lie.

52:42.864 --> 52:43.698
Do you understand me?

52:43.831 --> 52:45.733
-It wasn't.
-I don't care!

52:49.403 --> 52:50.905
Mr. and Mrs. Hayes,

52:51.039 --> 52:53.808
based on observable evidence
in your home,

52:53.941 --> 52:55.777
I believe it's in the best
interest of the children

52:55.910 --> 52:57.845
to be placed
into the care of DCFS

52:57.979 --> 53:00.313
while we complete
a further investigation.

53:01.649 --> 53:03.216
No. No way.
You said you would help my mom.

53:03.350 --> 53:04.752
She said she would help mom.

53:04.886 --> 53:06.521
Whatever my daughter
told you is not true.

53:06.654 --> 53:07.889
Please, I don't understand,
can we just sit down?

53:08.022 --> 53:09.423
We can just, we can just
sit down. Come on.

53:09.557 --> 53:10.725
Calm down, ma'am.
Calm down. Calm down.

53:10.858 --> 53:12.225
Have a seat.
Please, have a seat.

53:12.359 --> 53:13.326
Hey, enough.
Step away from my wife.

53:13.460 --> 53:14.962
Why do I have to go?

53:15.096 --> 53:16.263
You said you would help my mom.

53:16.396 --> 53:17.665
-I'm not a kid!
-It's okay, Riley.

53:17.799 --> 53:19.667
Don't talk to me
like I'm a little kid.

53:19.801 --> 53:21.536
-Calm down.
-Same team, remember?

53:21.669 --> 53:23.638
We're not.
You lied, you're a liar.

53:23.771 --> 53:24.972
You said you would help my mom.

53:25.106 --> 53:26.074
You can't do this.
Riley!

53:26.206 --> 53:28.776
Hey.
You can't do this.

53:41.889 --> 53:43.024
Riley!

54:13.921 --> 54:15.355
<i>Welcome back</i>

54:17.058 --> 54:18.526
It's okay. Hold still.
Okay.

54:23.965 --> 54:25.566
There. All done.

55:10.678 --> 55:12.046
You know you're gonna
have to go soon?

55:14.882 --> 55:15.983
I know.

55:59.861 --> 56:00.895
Riley.

56:02.597 --> 56:03.831
You're gonna be late.

56:07.367 --> 56:09.737
Come on, get up. Let's go.

56:18.312 --> 56:21.582
Mama Carol says we can go
to the good park this weekend.

56:21.716 --> 56:23.885
Stop calling her that.

56:24.018 --> 56:26.087
She's just taking care of us
until we go back home.

56:30.524 --> 56:32.760
Hey. Cool shirt.

56:34.629 --> 56:35.863
Thanks.

56:38.566 --> 56:39.800
What'd you bring for lunch?

56:42.103 --> 56:43.237
Mm-mmm. I don't know.

56:43.371 --> 56:44.605
Want to trade?

56:46.374 --> 56:47.675
Okay.

56:50.344 --> 56:52.013
Thanks.

56:54.582 --> 56:56.117
She didn't give you her lunch.

Whoo, heck of a grip.

1:00:25.960 --> 1:00:27.928
Hey, what happened to your eye?

1:00:30.731 --> 1:00:32.299
There was an incident.

1:00:32.433 --> 1:00:33.634
Someone hurt you?

1:00:34.969 --> 1:00:37.972
She got into a fight
with some other girls at school.

1:00:40.774 --> 1:00:42.243
Hey, who wants pizza, huh?

1:00:48.082 --> 1:00:49.950
Is Mommy coming?

1:00:50.084 --> 1:00:52.153
No. Mom couldn't make it.

1:00:52.286 --> 1:00:55.789
But she told me to tell you that
she loves you both very much.

1:00:58.192 --> 1:01:00.595
What's the matter? You don't eat
your crust anymore.

1:01:00.728 --> 1:01:01.962
When did that happen?

1:01:03.632 --> 1:01:05.199
Come on, crust builds character.

1:01:12.072 --> 1:01:13.374
Oh, it's terrible.

1:01:16.545 --> 1:01:18.112
Warned you.

1:01:18.245 --> 1:01:19.413
Oh, it speaks.

1:01:21.248 --> 1:01:22.249
How is school?

1:01:24.051 --> 1:01:25.352
I had to go to a new one.

1:01:27.054 --> 1:01:28.657
A new school, when?

1:01:28.789 --> 1:01:30.291
It's on the same campus.

1:01:31.892 --> 1:01:33.894
I... don't understand.

1:01:34.028 --> 1:01:36.130
Riley is enrolled in a satellite
program for children

1:01:36.263 --> 1:01:38.832
who need some extra
academic support.

1:01:40.201 --> 1:01:41.969
That's for stupid kids.

1:01:43.404 --> 1:01:44.972
Riley, you're not stupid.

1:01:46.407 --> 1:01:48.375
This doesn't make any sense.
I mean, she's a great reader.

1:01:48.510 --> 1:01:49.443
She loves school.

1:01:58.520 --> 1:01:59.753
What is this?

1:02:00.821 --> 1:02:02.156
Medicine.

1:02:02.289 --> 1:02:03.290
For what?

1:02:03.424 --> 1:02:04.425
My brain.

1:02:04.559 --> 1:02:07.027
It's generic methylphenidate.

1:02:07.161 --> 1:02:09.096
She's on a relatively
low dosage.

1:02:09.230 --> 1:02:11.365
Mary was diagnosed with ADHD.

1:02:11.498 --> 1:02:14.001
She's just a little kid.
She has a personality.

1:02:14.134 --> 1:02:16.103
You have to get our permission
for that, don't you?

1:02:16.237 --> 1:02:18.272
Parental consent
wasn't required in this case.

1:02:18.405 --> 1:02:22.076
The foster family and DCFS felt
it was the right choice.

1:02:28.949 --> 1:02:31.919
Hey. Baby, does
this stuff help you?

1:02:39.694 --> 1:02:42.463
If they say you have to take it,
then you have to take it, okay?

1:02:42.597 --> 1:02:43.831
Okay.

1:02:55.142 --> 1:02:57.778
If you'll excuse me,
I have to use the restroom.

1:03:01.982 --> 1:03:03.317
Maybe you should start
wrapping up.

1:03:25.839 --> 1:03:28.309
Hey, I've got a present for you.

1:03:28.442 --> 1:03:30.010
What is it?

1:03:30.144 --> 1:03:31.845
It's... it's in the car.

1:03:31.979 --> 1:03:33.180
You wanna go see it?

1:03:34.248 --> 1:03:35.916
Should we wait for Loraine?

1:03:40.087 --> 1:03:41.355
Let's not.

1:03:44.892 --> 1:03:45.859
We left my medicine.

1:03:45.993 --> 1:03:47.394
You don't need those, okay?

1:03:47.529 --> 1:03:48.896
You're perfect exactly the
way you are. Come on.

1:03:49.029 --> 1:03:50.831
Okay.

1:03:50.964 --> 1:03:52.567
Come on, get in the car.

1:03:52.701 --> 1:03:53.934
Where's the present?

1:03:54.068 --> 1:03:55.836
Uh, I forgot it at home.

1:03:55.969 --> 1:03:57.037
- Come on, we have to go.
- Dad? Dad?

1:03:57.171 --> 1:03:58.807
-You should write a note.
-What?

1:03:58.939 --> 1:04:00.542
Next time
before you leave the house,

1:04:00.675 --> 1:04:01.776
you should write a note,

1:04:01.909 --> 1:04:02.910
so you don't forget my present.

1:04:03.043 --> 1:04:04.679
- Dad!
- Good idea.

1:04:04.813 --> 1:04:06.046
What?

1:04:09.983 --> 1:04:11.185

1:05:02.903 --> 1:05:04.438

1:05:07.374 --> 1:05:09.577
It was who let the frogs out.

1:05:09.711 --> 1:05:11.679
- It's not what Dad said.
- I like mine better.

1:05:15.115 --> 1:05:16.518

1:05:19.386 --> 1:05:20.622
Doing your work today.

1:05:22.923 --> 1:05:24.425
Uh, it's... it's Sunday.

1:05:24.559 --> 1:05:26.427

Hmm. I'm not just gonna let you
watch SpongeBob all day.

1:05:32.299 --> 1:05:33.535
I have homework.

1:05:35.469 --> 1:05:36.504
Homework?

1:05:37.705 --> 1:05:39.507
I'm gonna have a talk
with your teacher.

1:05:41.041 --> 1:05:42.142
The way she loads you up.

1:05:42.276 --> 1:05:43.977
I know she doesn't grade
any of it.

1:05:47.715 --> 1:05:50.117
- You don't have-
- RILEY: No, it's fine.

1:05:50.250 --> 1:05:51.719
I don't want to do it.

1:05:51.853 --> 1:05:53.220
What can I say?
She's... she's a hard worker.

1:05:53.353 --> 1:05:57.124
Hmm. Who's hungry?

1:06:03.531 --> 1:06:05.265
You don't have any homework.

1:06:07.167 --> 1:06:08.670
Shut up. Pretend.

1:06:10.905 --> 1:06:11.940
This is stupid!

1:06:12.072 --> 1:06:14.509
Mary, quiet.

1:06:14.642 --> 1:06:15.743
Don't set her off again.

1:06:17.411 --> 1:06:19.213
Why are we pretending
we're in our old house?

1:06:19.346 --> 1:06:21.883
We're not in our old house.

1:06:22.015 --> 1:06:23.250
Dave.

1:06:26.320 --> 1:06:27.988
Where's the food?

1:06:28.121 --> 1:06:29.591
I thought we bought food.

1:06:32.527 --> 1:06:33.293
Alice.

1:06:35.162 --> 1:06:36.965
It's okay. It's okay, it's okay.

1:06:39.166 --> 1:06:41.201
They're gonna come inside.

1:06:41.335 --> 1:06:43.437
Honey, honey,
they're gonna come inside, okay?

1:06:44.906 --> 1:06:47.609
<i>Mr. Dave,</i>
<i>your house is surrounded.</i>

1:06:47.742 --> 1:06:49.711
Alice, look at me,
as long as the kids are here,

1:06:49.844 --> 1:06:50.778
they won't come in.

1:06:50.912 --> 1:06:52.279
You lied to me.

1:06:52.412 --> 1:06:53.581
<i>We have</i>
<i>a medical chop on standby.</i>

1:06:54.582 --> 1:06:56.518
<i>You need</i>
<i>to communicate with us.</i>

1:07:19.007 --> 1:07:21.576
Spider to command, do you copy?

1:07:21.709 --> 1:07:23.711
Looks like we got
some heavy manpower out here.

1:07:23.845 --> 1:07:26.614
Probably got a fucking rocket
launcher or something.

1:08:03.083 --> 1:08:06.353
<i>Mr. Hayes,</i>
<i>this is going to end.</i>

1:08:06.486 --> 1:08:08.322
<i>You do not control that.</i>

1:08:08.455 --> 1:08:09.624
<i>Think about your family.</i>

1:09:02.442 --> 1:09:03.845
Why do they do
this every night?

1:09:05.113 --> 1:09:06.346
So we can't sleep.

1:09:07.882 --> 1:09:09.182
They want us to leave.

1:09:12.820 --> 1:09:14.856
Mary.

1:09:14.989 --> 1:09:16.156
-What?
-Drums or guitar?

1:09:17.992 --> 1:09:20.293
Come on, gotta think fast,
drums or guitar?

1:09:20.427 --> 1:09:21.796
Oh, guitar.

1:09:23.698 --> 1:09:24.732
All right, cool.

1:10:14.148 --> 1:10:15.382
Hey, take it easy.

1:10:18.786 --> 1:10:20.054
Ow!

1:10:20.188 --> 1:10:21.956
Hey, that hurts.

1:10:23.323 --> 1:10:25.126
Mama Carol says
they have to do it tight

1:10:25.292 --> 1:10:26.961
so I don't look like a slob.

1:10:28.529 --> 1:10:30.297
Mama Carol called you a slob?

1:10:31.364 --> 1:10:33.467
Hmm. Yeah.

1:10:34.301 --> 1:10:36.037
Hmm.

1:10:36.170 --> 1:10:38.072
Mama Carol sounds like a bitch.

1:11:22.984 --> 1:11:25.285
How about that drink
you wanted?

1:11:27.855 --> 1:11:28.923
For real?

1:11:30.558 --> 1:11:31.959
Yeah, sure. Why not?

1:11:44.172 --> 1:11:45.773
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:11:45.907 --> 1:11:48.009
We gotta cheers to something.
Make it official.

1:11:50.878 --> 1:11:52.479
Pioneers?

1:11:52.613 --> 1:11:54.882
Yeah, sure. Pioneers.

1:12:03.057 --> 1:12:04.759
Does it taste better
when you're older?

1:12:06.027 --> 1:12:07.829
Nah. You just get better
at drinking it.

1:12:12.099 --> 1:12:13.366
Do you have a plan?

1:12:15.069 --> 1:12:16.103
No.

1:12:19.774 --> 1:12:21.108
I like this, though.

1:12:23.410 --> 1:12:24.679
What?

1:12:24.812 --> 1:12:26.047
Being together again.

1:12:36.157 --> 1:12:38.159
Yeah.

1:12:38.292 --> 1:12:39.660
Me too.

1:13:50.231 --> 1:13:51.198
Is there food?

1:14:44.484 --> 1:14:45.753
<i>911 operator.</i>

1:14:45.886 --> 1:14:47.955
Hey, can I get
a two meatball subs,

1:14:48.089 --> 1:14:50.858
toasted turkey sandwich
and a salami sandwich?

1:14:52.126 --> 1:14:53.160
Dad.

1:14:53.294 --> 1:14:54.929
No, no lettuce
on the salami, please.

1:14:55.930 --> 1:14:57.264
<i>Is this a joke?</i>

1:14:57.398 --> 1:14:58.766
No, it's not a joke.

1:14:58.899 --> 1:15:00.201
I don't have a phone book
and my kids are hungry.

1:15:02.370 --> 1:15:04.505
<i>Sir, this is -</i>
<i>we don't deliver sandwiches.</i>

1:15:04.638 --> 1:15:05.906
Well, why don't you tell
one of your guys

1:15:06.040 --> 1:15:07.708
parked outside of my house
to go get one?

1:15:09.677 --> 1:15:10.611
<i>Who am I speaking with?</i>

1:15:10.745 --> 1:15:12.046
This is Dave Hayes.

1:15:33.968 --> 1:15:36.103
Drop it at the door.
I'm not fucking around.

1:15:47.982 --> 1:15:49.550
You're gonna let me in or what?

1:15:53.454 --> 1:15:57.992
So you just took the kids
and walked right out the door?

1:15:58.125 --> 1:15:59.393
Pretty much.

1:15:59.528 --> 1:16:00.761
And then you...

1:16:02.363 --> 1:16:03.597
you came back here.

1:16:04.498 --> 1:16:05.766
Yeah, well,

1:16:05.900 --> 1:16:07.902
we weren't doing too well
without them here.

1:16:09.036 --> 1:16:11.105
Hmm.
Kids belong with their parents.

1:16:12.139 --> 1:16:14.642
Sheriff gave a press conference.

1:16:14.775 --> 1:16:16.110
Said you opened fire
on a cruiser

1:16:16.243 --> 1:16:17.211
when they pulled up.

1:16:17.344 --> 1:16:19.180
I hadn't fired a shot
in the air.

1:16:19.313 --> 1:16:20.748
That's about it.

1:16:20.881 --> 1:16:22.583
Well, I'm personally willing
to testify under oath

1:16:22.716 --> 1:16:24.251
you couldn't hit shit
if you tried.

1:16:26.053 --> 1:16:28.523
That being said,
he had a driveway full of cops

1:16:28.656 --> 1:16:30.124
who don't know you
as well as I do.

1:16:31.859 --> 1:16:33.127
Danik's protesting

1:16:33.260 --> 1:16:35.996
the police, made signs
and everything.

1:16:37.364 --> 1:16:40.067
He got the whole family
camped out at the turnout.

1:16:40.201 --> 1:16:43.804
Personally, I think
Steve likes being on TV.

1:16:43.938 --> 1:16:45.106
God bless him.

1:16:45.239 --> 1:16:48.642
So we're the Danik clan's
last stand, huh?

1:16:48.776 --> 1:16:49.710
Well, you're going to die
on a cross,

1:16:49.844 --> 1:16:51.078
make it a big one.

1:16:53.047 --> 1:16:55.216
I don't know how big we are.

1:16:55.349 --> 1:16:57.818
Don't tell that
to the news crews.

1:16:57.952 --> 1:17:00.020
They got these people
on little boxes

1:17:00.154 --> 1:17:03.491
talking about your six, seven,
eight on screen at once.

1:17:03.624 --> 1:17:05.594
Are any of them on our team?

1:17:05.726 --> 1:17:07.194
Mostly just the assholes.

1:17:08.295 --> 1:17:11.365
Well, us assholes
are a proud people.

1:17:11.499 --> 1:17:12.766
We have to stick together.

1:17:17.204 --> 1:17:18.706
What'd you learn from this?

1:17:20.542 --> 1:17:23.010
Like I said, kids belong
with their parents.

1:17:23.144 --> 1:17:27.815
No, I mean, from all of it,
this... this place.

1:17:35.156 --> 1:17:36.290
Man, I thought it'd be nice

1:17:36.423 --> 1:17:37.791
not to be part of the world
anymore.

1:17:39.126 --> 1:17:40.761
What do you got
against the world?

1:17:40.895 --> 1:17:42.296
It had something against us.

1:17:44.665 --> 1:17:47.168
You know,
this is the world, right?

1:17:49.837 --> 1:17:51.005
You're still in it, buddy.

1:17:52.840 --> 1:17:56.410
All he did was move
to the top of a mountain.

1:18:04.251 --> 1:18:05.252
Can you help us?

1:18:06.887 --> 1:18:08.255
Can you talk to them?

1:18:08.389 --> 1:18:10.124
Tell them
that we're good people.

1:18:13.494 --> 1:18:14.695
When I was in the Corps,

1:18:16.297 --> 1:18:17.331
during basic,

1:18:19.099 --> 1:18:22.469
they put us in a room and tossed
in percussion grenades.

1:18:22.604 --> 1:18:24.405
It was fast.

1:18:24.539 --> 1:18:25.873
You go blind.

1:18:26.006 --> 1:18:27.542
The shock wave wrecks
your inner ear

1:18:27.676 --> 1:18:29.343
so you can't stand.

1:18:29.476 --> 1:18:32.581
I saw grown men puking
their guts out

1:18:32.713 --> 1:18:34.315
till nothing but bile came out.

1:18:36.850 --> 1:18:38.018
What do you think
one of those grenades

1:18:38.152 --> 1:18:39.353
will do to a child?

1:18:49.063 --> 1:18:50.297
What do we do?

1:18:54.468 --> 1:18:58.105
Let me walk out
with the kids, today.

1:19:05.879 --> 1:19:07.147
Whose side are you on?

1:19:08.882 --> 1:19:10.217
They're coming in, Dave.

1:19:12.353 --> 1:19:15.823
I don't know when,
but this will end.

1:19:16.824 --> 1:19:18.292
But you...

1:19:18.425 --> 1:19:19.561
What, you're trying to take
my family away from me?

1:19:19.694 --> 1:19:21.228
You need to end this right.

1:19:21.362 --> 1:19:23.130
-You need to leave.
-No, not yet.

1:19:25.899 --> 1:19:28.035
Dave, stop.

1:19:29.571 --> 1:19:30.672
Riley, Dad.

1:19:30.804 --> 1:19:32.373
Baby.

1:19:32.507 --> 1:19:33.675
He's right.

1:19:33.807 --> 1:19:35.309
What are you
fucking talking about?

1:19:35.442 --> 1:19:37.244
What do you mean?

1:19:37.378 --> 1:19:38.812
You don't ever want
to see our kids again?

1:19:38.946 --> 1:19:40.548
-Is that what you want?
-Dave, stop.

1:19:40.682 --> 1:19:43.217
You think I'm some
sort of fucking joke, huh?

1:19:43.350 --> 1:19:44.151
This is my house!

1:19:44.285 --> 1:19:46.320
Ahh!

1:19:46.453 --> 1:19:48.088
Shots fired, shots fired.

1:19:49.223 --> 1:19:50.424
Get out!

1:19:51.825 --> 1:19:53.961
-Find a safe place to hide.
-Don't talk to my fucking kids.

1:19:54.094 --> 1:19:56.297
- Girls, upstairs.
- Dave.

1:19:56.430 --> 1:19:57.464
-Get out of my fucking house!
-Okay.

1:19:57.599 --> 1:19:58.832
Get out!

1:19:58.966 --> 1:20:00.901
Stay back.
Stay back from the door.

1:20:01.035 --> 1:20:02.803
Move!

1:20:02.936 --> 1:20:05.239
Get the fuck out
of my house, Eric.

1:20:09.176 --> 1:20:10.545
Argh! Fuck you!

1:20:13.947 --> 1:20:15.182
Dad.

1:20:21.155 --> 1:20:22.389
Oh, jeez! No.

1:20:23.625 --> 1:20:25.459
Alice.

1:20:25.593 --> 1:20:27.595
Hey, no, don't go,
don't go, don't go.

1:20:27.729 --> 1:20:30.964
Stay with me. Stay with me.

1:20:31.098 --> 1:20:32.534
Do you understand?

1:20:32.667 --> 1:20:34.968
Girls, come here.
Keep pressure on her.

1:20:41.442 --> 1:20:45.346
Mommy. Please. Please, please.

1:20:49.283 --> 1:20:50.851
Keep pressure on it.

1:20:55.255 --> 1:20:56.857
You don't need me anymore.

1:20:58.158 --> 1:21:00.160
You're all grown up now.

1:21:01.962 --> 1:21:03.598
Promise me that you won't leave.

1:21:05.265 --> 1:21:06.400
Promise!

1:21:08.803 --> 1:21:10.104
Promise!

1:21:11.806 --> 1:21:13.040
Promise.

1:21:30.792 --> 1:21:33.795
Get out of the way,
get out of the way, move, move.

1:21:33.961 --> 1:21:35.496
Hon, you're okay, you're okay.

1:21:35.630 --> 1:21:37.431
Riley, anything that
comes through that door,

1:21:37.565 --> 1:21:38.700
you shoot it.

1:21:38.833 --> 1:21:40.835
Do you understand me?
Do you understand me?

1:21:40.968 --> 1:21:43.137
Honey, honey, honey, honey.
Honey.

1:21:43.270 --> 1:21:45.507
Stay with me, okay?
Just stay with me.

1:21:45.640 --> 1:21:48.543
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.

1:21:51.746 --> 1:21:53.313
You're gonna be okay.
I promise you.

1:21:55.850 --> 1:21:57.918
<i>Mr. Hayes, is</i>
<i>everyone inside okay?</i>

1:21:58.051 --> 1:21:59.587
You shot my wife!

1:22:00.954 --> 1:22:04.358
Fuck you! Fuck you!

1:22:05.560 --> 1:22:08.530
Hold your fire.
Hold your fucking fire.

1:22:08.663 --> 1:22:11.131
Why can't you just
leave us alone?

1:22:11.265 --> 1:22:13.568
We just want to be left alone!
It's all we ever wanted!

1:22:20.107 --> 1:22:21.341
Fuck you!

1:22:25.012 --> 1:22:26.614
Dad!
We just want to be left alone.

1:22:26.748 --> 1:22:27.916
That's it.

1:22:28.048 --> 1:22:29.216
-Why can't you do that?
-Dad! Dad!

1:22:29.349 --> 1:22:30.350
What?
Stop!

1:22:30.484 --> 1:22:33.253
You want to see your mom die?

1:22:33.387 --> 1:22:34.923
They did this to her.
They shot her.

1:22:35.055 --> 1:22:37.224
They're going to come in here
and take her away from me.

1:22:37.357 --> 1:22:38.258
No.

1:22:38.392 --> 1:22:39.493
Now you shut up
and listen to me.

1:22:39.627 --> 1:22:40.795
No, you listen.

1:22:40.929 --> 1:22:42.664
You don't ever listen.

1:22:42.797 --> 1:22:44.498
All Mom ever needed was help.

1:22:45.533 --> 1:22:47.267
They didn't do this to her.

1:22:48.937 --> 1:22:50.170
You did.

1:23:23.136 --> 1:23:25.038
We'll never be a family again.

1:23:28.342 --> 1:23:30.077
This isn't home anymore.

1:23:31.713 --> 1:23:34.248
It hasn't been
for a really long time.

1:23:37.150 --> 1:23:39.353
But this place doesn't make us
a family.

1:23:41.689 --> 1:23:43.023
It never did.

1:23:49.029 --> 1:23:50.364
I'm sorry.

1:24:29.369 --> 1:24:32.840
<i>Once there was a family</i>
<i>of pioneers,</i>

1:24:34.709 --> 1:24:36.476

<i>for a better life.</i>

1:24:38.412 --> 1:24:42.050

1:24:56.931 --> 1:24:58.833
<i>They had a house</i>

1:25:03.571 --> 1:25:06.641
<i>And they laughed and fished</i>

1:25:08.108 --> 1:25:09.644
<i>and grew their own vegetables.</i>

1:25:24.859 --> 1:25:26.694
