02:09.332 --> 02:14.754
When the Second World War was over, we
were the one great power in the world.

02:14.837 --> 02:17.924
The Soviets had a substantial
military machine,

02:18.007 --> 02:21.427
but they could not
touch us in power.

02:21.511 --> 02:24.305
We had this enormous force
that had been built up.

02:24.430 --> 02:27.099
We had the greatest
fleet in the world.

02:27.183 --> 02:31.437
We'd come through the
war economically sound.

02:31.521 --> 02:37.360
And I think that, in addition to
feeling a sense of responsibility,

02:37.443 --> 02:40.780
we also began to feel...

02:40.863 --> 02:44.450
the-the sense of a world power,

02:44.534 --> 02:49.664
that possibly we could control
the future of the world.

03:34.792 --> 03:39.046
Our vision of progress is not
limited to our own country.

03:39.130 --> 03:42.258
We extend it to all the
peoples of the world.

03:46.053 --> 03:48.890
Military action in Indochina.

03:48.973 --> 03:52.768
French regulars land along the coast
in search of roving communist bands.

03:52.894 --> 03:56.063
For France, it represents
a tremendous sacrifice...

03:56.189 --> 03:58.816
of manpower and
financial resources.

03:58.941 --> 04:01.611
Without American help,
the burden would be too great.

04:13.331 --> 04:18.586
I do not expect that there is going to
be a communist victory in Indochina.

04:54.872 --> 04:58.376
I affirm that Secretary Dulles...

04:58.501 --> 05:02.129
offered me two atomic bombs.

05:02.213 --> 05:04.340
Two, uh...

05:07.093 --> 05:10.179
Neither one, neither three. Two.

05:12.306 --> 05:17.687
If Indochina goes, several
things happen right away.

05:17.812 --> 05:22.692
The Accra Peninsula, the little bit
of end hanging on down there...

05:22.817 --> 05:25.153
would be scarcely defensible.

05:25.236 --> 05:27.029
The tin and the tungsten...

05:27.155 --> 05:31.117
that we so greatly value from
that area would cease coming.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.494
We don't see the end of the
tunnel, but, uh, I must say...

05:33.619 --> 05:37.999
I don't think it's darker than it was a
year ago, in some ways lighter. Yes?

05:38.082 --> 05:41.502
So we must be ready
to fight in Vietnam,

05:41.586 --> 05:45.506
but the ultimate victory
will depend upon the hearts...

05:45.590 --> 05:50.344
and the minds of the people
who actually live out there.

05:50.470 --> 05:52.388
Throughout the war in Vietnam,

05:52.472 --> 05:55.766
the United States has exercised
a degree of restraint...

05:55.892 --> 05:58.352
unprecedented in the annals of war.

07:08.464 --> 07:11.926
There was just one thing,

07:12.009 --> 07:16.472
one small word that enabled
myself and my buddies...

07:16.597 --> 07:19.475
to stay alive those many years.

07:19.559 --> 07:22.436
That one thing was faith.

07:22.520 --> 07:27.441
Faith in my family,
my God and my country.

07:28.985 --> 07:33.156
I remembered high school.
I remembered playing sports there.

07:33.281 --> 07:35.741
And I can remember
my coach saying...

07:35.867 --> 07:39.287
"When the going gets tough,
the tough get going,

07:39.370 --> 07:42.665
because winners never quit
and quitters never win."

07:42.790 --> 07:45.251
Why did I go to Vietnam?

07:45.334 --> 07:50.006
I will have to go back to 1965,
when I was 22 years old.

07:50.131 --> 07:54.302
At that time, communism was once
again trying to muscle its way...

07:54.385 --> 07:56.471
into a free country.

08:00.349 --> 08:03.519
That would assert that there's a
majority of people in that country...

08:03.644 --> 08:06.022
that want to be communist.

08:06.147 --> 08:08.274
Why do they need us then?

08:08.357 --> 08:14.572
Because they were subjected to,
uh, military attack from outside.

08:14.697 --> 08:18.826
Uh, the, uh...

08:18.951 --> 08:22.663
Are you really asking me
this goddamn silly question?

08:22.747 --> 08:25.583
- You really want me to go into this?
- Yes.

08:25.708 --> 08:28.836
I mean... I mean, you know,
we really got to go back to...

08:28.961 --> 08:31.756
You just want me to go back
to the origins of this thing then.

08:31.881 --> 08:36.302
All right, I'll do it, but this is
pretty pedestrian stuff, I must say,

08:36.385 --> 08:38.513
at this late stage of the game.

08:38.638 --> 08:40.807
Honestly it is.

08:40.890 --> 08:42.808
I'll do it. All right.

08:42.892 --> 08:45.311
- There's disagreement about the origins.
- No, there's not.

08:45.394 --> 08:47.563
No, there's not. There's no doubt.

08:47.688 --> 08:51.859
All right, I'll answer your question,
you can throw away that tape.

08:51.943 --> 08:55.780
I didn't expect to have to go back
to this kind of sophomoric stuff,

08:55.905 --> 08:58.866
but I'll do it.

08:58.950 --> 09:04.539
The problem, uh, began, uh,

09:04.664 --> 09:07.542
in its present phase,
after the Sputnik,

09:07.625 --> 09:12.088
the launch of the Sputnik
in 1957, October.

09:12.171 --> 09:16.843
This opened a phase
of not well-coordinated,

09:16.926 --> 09:20.972
but universally optimistic and
hopeful communist enterprise...

09:21.097 --> 09:23.224
in many parts of the world.

09:23.307 --> 09:26.727
Renewed hostile actions...

09:26.811 --> 09:31.440
against United States ships on the
high seas in the Gulf of Tonkin...

09:31.566 --> 09:37.280
have today required me to order
military forces of the United States...

09:37.405 --> 09:40.199
to take action in reply.

09:40.283 --> 09:44.871
We always hesitate in public to use
the word "lie" but a lie is a lie.

09:44.954 --> 09:48.416
I mean, it's a
misrepresentation of fact.

09:48.499 --> 09:52.795
And it's supposed to be a criminal
act if its done under oath.

09:52.920 --> 09:56.424
Mr. Johnson didn't say it
under oath, he just said it.

09:56.549 --> 09:59.594
We don't usually have
the president under oath.

09:59.719 --> 10:04.974
There are those who ask why this
responsibility should be ours.

10:05.099 --> 10:07.810
The answer, I think, is simple.

10:07.935 --> 10:11.314
There is no one else
who can do the job.

10:11.397 --> 10:14.984
If necessary,
I am ready to go back.

10:15.109 --> 10:17.737
We all must be ready.

10:17.820 --> 10:22.408
You must have the political, economic
and philosophical courage to send me...

10:22.492 --> 10:25.161
or do whatever you think
is necessary.

10:25.286 --> 10:28.623
I must be ready to go.
If I did well,

10:28.706 --> 10:31.792
it is only because Linden did
well in bringing me up...

10:31.918 --> 10:35.421
and making me into a man.

10:35.505 --> 10:38.132
If I served the military well,

10:38.257 --> 10:42.178
it is only because the military
trained me to be a good officer.

10:43.346 --> 10:45.640
If I am a good American,

10:45.765 --> 10:50.520
it is only because America
brought me up to be a good American.

10:50.645 --> 10:55.149
- Three, two, one...

10:55.274 --> 10:57.860
It was a sight to touch
the heart of the most callous.

10:57.985 --> 11:01.864
Lieutenant George Coker was back in
Linden, New Jersey, the hero of the day.

11:01.989 --> 11:04.826
Three thousand people turned out
to greet him. Schools were closed...

11:04.909 --> 11:07.537
and streets were blocked as the
young former prisoner of war...

11:07.662 --> 11:10.832
walked on a red carpet
to the steps of city hall.

11:10.957 --> 11:14.001
Mike is still open. Two, one...

11:14.126 --> 11:17.713
I'm from Duncan, Oklahoma, which
is about 90 miles south of here.

11:17.839 --> 11:21.300
And, uh, and I lived
around several places...

11:21.425 --> 11:25.847
uh, Missouri, Chicago,
Detroit, uh, Germany,

11:27.056 --> 11:29.809
Uh...

11:29.892 --> 11:32.603
by the time I got out of high
school, I was very conservative.

11:32.728 --> 11:35.439
We have, in Duncan high school...
we bought...

11:35.565 --> 11:38.151
the high school had bought a, uh...

11:38.234 --> 11:40.862
Excuse me...
a John Birch package on communism.

11:40.945 --> 11:43.281
So we studied communism
via the John Birch Society,

11:43.406 --> 11:47.994
the big red map with the flowing
out of the disease and so forth,

11:48.077 --> 11:51.122
and-and learned how Karl Marx
was a very cruel man...

11:51.247 --> 11:54.667
and used to, uh, make his
family suffer and so forth.

11:54.750 --> 11:59.672
Uh, so when I got out of high school,
I thought basically that, um,

11:59.755 --> 12:01.799
Teddy Roosevelt's
what this country needed,

12:01.924 --> 12:04.844
and F.D.R. had kind of sold us
down the drain to the commies.

12:04.927 --> 12:08.055
The communist conspiracy is a deliberate
and predictable plan of action...

12:08.181 --> 12:10.099
to subvert the world.

12:10.183 --> 12:12.894
Mosinee, Wisconsin,
in a unique Mayday object lesson,

12:12.977 --> 12:16.564
shows what could happen here
if communism took over.

12:16.689 --> 12:20.359
The unyielding chief of police is
liquidated by American Legionnaires...

12:20.443 --> 12:22.570
portraying Red trigger men.

12:24.697 --> 12:28.326
A grim demonstration of
what subversion could lead to,

12:28.451 --> 12:33.080
Mosinee's Mayday serves as a sharp
warning to all democratic communities.

12:33.206 --> 12:37.460
It's an international,
criminal conspiracy.

12:37.585 --> 12:40.421
Before we know it, we're gonna
turn our backs around someday,

12:40.505 --> 12:43.549
the whole United States, we're gonna
turn around and see nothing but V. C...

12:43.633 --> 12:46.636
or not V.C., but communism... we're gonna
turn around and say, "What happened?"

12:46.719 --> 12:49.263
People just walking in
with riots, drugs, you name it.

12:49.347 --> 12:51.390
They're tearing us down
from the inside out.

12:51.474 --> 12:56.103
In 1917, when the communists
overthrew the Russian government,

12:56.187 --> 13:01.317
there was 1 communist
for every 2,277 persons...

13:01.442 --> 13:03.319
in Russia.

13:03.444 --> 13:06.239
In the United States today,
there is one communist...

13:06.322 --> 13:11.285
for every 1,814 persons
in this country.

13:11.410 --> 13:15.873
If we lose Indochina, Mr. Jenkins,
we will lose the Pacific,

13:15.998 --> 13:19.460
and we'll be an island
in a communist sea.

13:19.585 --> 13:22.964
- Go ahead, how does it go?
- Oh, mother.

13:24.757 --> 13:26.717
I swear that I am not now...

13:26.843 --> 13:30.680
or ever have been a member
of the communist party.

13:30.805 --> 13:33.266
Feel better?

13:34.684 --> 13:36.769
Of course, when it gets down
to communism, uh,

13:36.853 --> 13:39.689
I've been fighting communism
since 1951, actually.

13:39.814 --> 13:44.694
I was looked at, you know, the American
fighting man, as being, uh, you know,

13:44.819 --> 13:49.574
like a warrior of sorts,
you know, due to my background,

13:49.699 --> 13:51.576
the way my mother brought me up.

13:51.701 --> 13:55.163
She always spoke of the warrior
societies of our tribe...

13:55.288 --> 13:58.457
and of the different tribes around
us and how that these men...

13:58.541 --> 14:02.420
always had to work to gain the
respect of the people around them...

14:02.545 --> 14:07.008
and how they had to live, uh,
more or less a life dictated to them...

14:07.091 --> 14:10.720
by the society that they belonged
to, and it was extremely hard.

14:10.845 --> 14:16.142
I-I looked around and from listening to
my uncles and a lot of my relations...

14:16.225 --> 14:19.145
they had been in the Marine Corps...
and they always told me that...

14:19.228 --> 14:23.191
the Marine Corps was the hardest service
to cope with physically and mentally.

14:23.274 --> 14:26.110
And I naturally wanted to be
the best at that time,

14:26.235 --> 14:29.530
and I looked at the Marine Corps
as being the elite of the elite,

14:29.655 --> 14:32.033
the warrior society
in the United States.

14:32.116 --> 14:36.871
Now it might sound
cliché-ish to say that,

14:36.996 --> 14:41.417
"My country, may it always be right,
but right or wrong, my country."

14:41.542 --> 14:44.545
But that's how I felt back in '67.

14:44.670 --> 14:47.340
And during my senior year,

14:47.423 --> 14:51.719
I said I've got an
obligation to serve.

14:51.844 --> 14:54.222
I've got to fulfill it.

14:54.305 --> 14:58.392
There's no reason physically
why I would be exempted,

14:58.518 --> 15:01.938
and therefore, I'm gonna enlist.

15:26.254 --> 15:28.214
- What you got there?
- Picture.

15:28.297 --> 15:30.216
Picture? How much picture?

15:30.299 --> 15:34.095
- Three thousand?
- I go beaucoup hungry. I sell 3,000.

15:34.220 --> 15:37.557
- You go here, too much money.
- I buy watch for 1,500.

15:37.640 --> 15:41.102
No, you sell to me?
You lie. You lie, you die.

15:41.227 --> 15:44.105
- You give massage? What else you give?
- Yes.

15:44.188 --> 15:46.649
Huh?

15:46.732 --> 15:50.278
- I buy you one beer, okay?
- You-You buy me one beer?

15:50.361 --> 15:52.613
No, no. No money.
Go home, mama-san.

15:52.738 --> 15:56.617
Please, go home, mama-san.

15:56.701 --> 15:59.579
No. Go home, mama-san.

15:59.662 --> 16:03.499
No. Go home, mama-san.
Okay? No. Go home, mama-san.

16:03.624 --> 16:06.210
- You will like.
- No. No.

16:11.340 --> 16:13.968
Huh?

16:14.093 --> 16:16.137
- How much?
- One thousand.

16:16.220 --> 16:19.515
You? Ah, it's too much. Beaucoup.

16:19.640 --> 16:22.685
Yeah, for sure. No, no good.

17:25.455 --> 17:30.503
We thought of ourselves, I think,
as trying to defeat communists.

17:30.586 --> 17:35.299
Defeat... Accepting a view of, uh...
the Walt Rostow kind of view...

17:35.424 --> 17:38.052
of covert aggression of some kind.

17:38.136 --> 17:40.930
The kind of view that enabled you
to think of the conflict...

17:41.055 --> 17:43.015
in, really, World War II terms.

17:43.099 --> 17:45.017
That was an unquestioned
assumption.

17:45.101 --> 17:47.520
It had an idealistic flavor to it,

17:47.603 --> 17:51.440
but it was the underpinning of
an imperial policy, basically.

17:51.566 --> 17:56.779
I shared the assumption, very easily, and
felt it as an idealistic one really.

17:56.904 --> 17:58.781
We were doing something for them.

17:58.906 --> 18:02.577
I recall that I was in the
New York area at the time,

18:02.702 --> 18:08.249
and I stopped by to see General MacArthur,
who I had known for several years.

18:09.876 --> 18:14.255
Uh, when he greeted me, he made,
uh, quite a prophetic statement.

18:15.590 --> 18:20.428
He said, "Westmoreland,
I-I see you have a new job."

18:21.971 --> 18:25.933
He said, "I hope you appreciate
that this new assignment...

18:27.351 --> 18:31.606
is filled with opportunities,
but fraught with hazards."

18:31.689 --> 18:35.610
And indeed, uh,
this was a prophetic statement.

18:56.088 --> 18:58.508
It can be described
much like, uh...

18:58.633 --> 19:02.970
a-a-a singer doing an aria...

19:03.054 --> 19:06.724
that's totally into what he's doing,
you know, totally feeling it.

19:06.849 --> 19:09.560
He knows the aria,
and he's experiencing the aria.

19:09.685 --> 19:14.106
And he knows his limits, and he knows
whether he's doing it and doing it well.

19:14.232 --> 19:16.651
Flying an aircraft
can be a great deal like that.

19:16.734 --> 19:18.653
What's a race driver feel like?

19:18.736 --> 19:21.531
Why does a guy want to drive
in the Indianapolis 500?

19:21.656 --> 19:23.991
I guess, perhaps,
the risk of dying,

19:24.116 --> 19:26.327
being killed is part of it
that makes it thrilling.

19:30.998 --> 19:34.627
I can tell when the aircraft feels
right, when it's about to stall.

19:34.710 --> 19:38.339
I can tell when I cant
pull another fraction of a pound...

19:38.464 --> 19:41.968
or the airplane will stall,
flip out and spin on me.

19:42.051 --> 19:45.096
I would follow a pathway on something
like a TV screen in front of me...

19:45.221 --> 19:47.640
that would direct me
right, left or center...

19:47.723 --> 19:50.852
follow the steering, keep the
steering symbol, uh, centered.

19:50.977 --> 19:54.438
I'd see a little attack light
when we'd stepped into attack.

19:54.564 --> 19:59.527
I could pull the "commit" switch on
my stick, and the computer took over.

19:59.610 --> 20:03.322
A computer figured out the ballistics,
the airspeed, the slant range...

20:03.406 --> 20:05.491
and dropped the bombs when we
got to the appropriate point,

20:05.575 --> 20:07.702
in whichever kind of attack
we'd selected,

20:07.785 --> 20:11.914
whether it was flying straight and
level or tossing our bombs out.

20:12.039 --> 20:15.710
So it was very much of
a technical expertise thing.

20:15.835 --> 20:19.005
I was a good pilot, you know.
I had, uh, uh,

20:19.088 --> 20:21.340
I had a lot of pride
in my ability to fly.

20:26.471 --> 20:29.056
You're up there
doing something that, uh,

20:29.140 --> 20:33.728
mankind has only dreamed of; the flying,
especially at night, in an aircraft.

20:33.811 --> 20:37.273
The A-6 is one of the few that can
really do it the way we did it.

20:37.398 --> 20:41.110
Um, a World War II aviator would not
even dream of doing the things we did.

20:41.235 --> 20:43.196
It's definitely
the ultimate in aviation.

20:56.542 --> 20:59.962
Almost everybody
has blown off firecrackers.

21:00.087 --> 21:03.132
The thrill you get when you
see something explode as a child,

21:03.257 --> 21:05.384
or even as an adult almost.

21:05.468 --> 21:08.387
You put something in the can and
watch the can blow up in the air.

21:14.685 --> 21:17.355
And the excitement,
the sense of excitement,

21:17.480 --> 21:20.441
especially if you're getting
shot at, is just incredible.

21:22.693 --> 21:24.987
You get there, have a real
good mission, hit your target,

21:25.112 --> 21:27.657
find out later your target
was totally destroyed,

21:27.782 --> 21:31.118
that it wasn't one of these misses
or almost, you got it.

21:31.202 --> 21:36.082
And come back and make a night carrier
landing recovery. Uh, that's fantastic.

21:36.165 --> 21:39.293
To say it's thrilling,
yes, it's deeply satisfying.

21:53.432 --> 21:56.185
The planes again.

21:56.310 --> 22:00.148
Are they American or Vietnamese?

22:00.273 --> 22:04.443
I don't know
whose they are. Just airplanes.

22:07.947 --> 22:10.491
What was this here?

22:10.616 --> 22:13.161
I used to raise pigs
here, right there.

22:15.746 --> 22:20.334
Where was the kitchen?

22:24.213 --> 22:27.008
The kitchen was here.
They built it with bricks.

22:27.091 --> 22:30.178
This was the floor.
And this was for the heat.

22:30.261 --> 22:32.847
What's that?

22:32.930 --> 22:34.932
That is the bomb crater.

22:35.057 --> 22:38.478
The bombs dropped there
and destroyed everything I had.

22:43.774 --> 22:48.237
An older sister died,
and I've another older sister left.

22:48.321 --> 22:51.324
Yes, there were just the three of us.
But then one died.

22:51.407 --> 22:54.577
And I'm supposed to live
in a house over there.

22:56.454 --> 22:59.373
But now it's just a heap of rubble.

22:59.457 --> 23:03.711
How old was your sister?

23:03.795 --> 23:06.172
Seventy-eight.

23:06.255 --> 23:09.675
What did she die of?

23:09.759 --> 23:12.345
Bombs. Bombs were dropped
here the other day,

23:12.428 --> 23:14.430
and they killed her.

23:24.232 --> 23:26.275
I'm so unhappy.

23:35.368 --> 23:38.329
My sister died
and I've got no home left.

23:38.454 --> 23:40.832
I've moved in with my sister here.

23:43.751 --> 23:45.711
I've been wounded.

23:48.381 --> 23:53.094
I can't do anything for a living now.
I'm old and weak.

23:53.177 --> 23:57.598
I've got nothing to sell.
Nothing to do.

24:23.499 --> 24:25.543
Mm.

24:31.007 --> 24:33.426
You really just don't have
time for personal thoughts...

24:33.509 --> 24:36.971
when you're up there flying around
at 500, 600 miles an hours.

24:37.054 --> 24:39.432
You might call it an electronic war
in a certain way.

24:39.515 --> 24:41.642
I didn't have time to think
about anything else.

24:41.767 --> 24:44.979
If you wanted to later, you might.
But it was all business.

24:45.104 --> 24:47.398
It's, um, just strictly
professionalism.

24:47.523 --> 24:49.817
We had a job to do and we did it.

24:49.942 --> 24:53.070
Never could see the people.
You never could see...

24:53.196 --> 24:56.199
Occasionally you saw the houses when
you were bombing around a village...

24:56.324 --> 24:58.367
or bombing in a village.

24:58.493 --> 25:00.745
Uh, you never heard the explosion.

25:00.870 --> 25:04.165
You never saw any blood or any screams.
It was very clean.

25:04.290 --> 25:07.502
You're doing a job.

25:07.627 --> 25:10.004
You're an expert at what you do.

25:13.466 --> 25:15.593
I was a technician.

25:20.515 --> 25:23.476
Everything just
collapsed under the bombs.

25:23.559 --> 25:25.561
Everything just caved in.

25:31.067 --> 25:34.237
It's like a bird and its nest.

25:35.738 --> 25:38.574
The way things are
with the house in the rubble,

25:39.909 --> 25:43.746
the bird comes home
and finds no nest.

25:43.871 --> 25:47.875
Where am I to find a place to sit
and work for something to eat?

25:48.000 --> 25:51.712
Even a bird needs a nest
it can go back to,

25:51.838 --> 25:54.465
crawl into for sleep and food.

26:17.113 --> 26:19.782
Look, they're focusing on us now.

26:22.493 --> 26:27.123
First they bomb as much as
they please, then they film.

26:36.883 --> 26:40.803
We fought against the
Chinese for 12 centuries.

26:40.887 --> 26:43.514
We fought against the French
for 100 years.

26:47.935 --> 26:51.522
And finally, when the war
was lost by the French in 1954...

26:51.647 --> 26:53.941
at the battle of Dien Bien Phu,

26:54.066 --> 26:57.236
the Vietnamese were liberated
from foreign oppression.

27:02.450 --> 27:07.288
But it was at that precise moment
that the Americans came to Vietnam.

27:07.413 --> 27:11.793
Little by little at first.
Then more and more as an invasion,

27:11.876 --> 27:14.295
an invasion of the American army.

27:17.423 --> 27:20.343
Five hundred thousand of them
in Vietnam.

27:20.468 --> 27:24.263
And this war
became a war of genocide.

27:24.347 --> 27:27.642
The people of North Vietnam
and South Vietnam...

27:27.725 --> 27:32.814
fight only for freedom,
independence and national unity.

27:34.857 --> 27:39.987
This war is a war against
the American imperialists.

27:40.112 --> 27:43.449
This is our war for independence.

27:54.502 --> 27:58.714
What we are trying to put across this
afternoon is to get you to realize...

27:58.840 --> 28:01.676
that these weren't mythical,
hazy people from the past.

28:01.759 --> 28:04.011
These were very real people.

28:04.095 --> 28:07.932
When they rose up against the
most powerful army in the world,

28:08.057 --> 28:11.018
they were actually putting everything
on the line that they had:

28:11.102 --> 28:15.189
Their homes, their wealth,
their past and their future.

28:17.942 --> 28:20.319
That all men are created equal.

28:20.403 --> 28:24.532
That they are endowed by their creator
with certain unalienable rights.

28:24.657 --> 28:30.079
That among these are life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness."

28:30.204 --> 28:32.665
And when you judge the Revolution
and the problems and the success we had,

28:32.748 --> 28:34.667
it was a two-way street.

28:34.750 --> 28:37.879
A good many citizens
at the time of the Revolution...

28:38.004 --> 28:40.590
actually stayed
and fought with the British.

28:40.715 --> 28:42.717
It was close to being a civil war
in many areas.

28:42.842 --> 28:45.511
You actually split
many-many families.

28:45.595 --> 28:48.389
Thomas Jefferson said,
"The tree of revolution is..."

28:48.514 --> 28:50.433
or "The tree of liberty is...

28:50.516 --> 28:53.936
watered by the blood of revolution
every generation."

28:54.061 --> 28:58.441
And I think that's a little exaggerated,
but there's some truth to that.

28:58.566 --> 29:00.985
The war had come
to Westchester County,

29:01.110 --> 29:05.448
but so too had independence
and a new responsibility.

29:05.573 --> 29:08.618
Men are getting killed, men are
killing. That's the parallel.

29:08.743 --> 29:11.329
As far as politics,
are you kidding?

29:11.454 --> 29:14.123
Oriental politics?
Don't put me on, man.

29:15.458 --> 29:16.959
Fire!

29:18.878 --> 29:21.923
We haven't found his weapon yet.
We're still looking for it.

29:22.006 --> 29:23.925
- You got a weapon?
- No, sir.

29:24.008 --> 29:25.927
He had one, man.
This guy's got ammo.

29:26.010 --> 29:28.763
I'm planning to medivac this guy.

29:34.435 --> 29:36.979
The people who are
living in the jungle,

29:37.104 --> 29:41.275
under the bombs, without pay,
without their families,

29:41.400 --> 29:44.654
are doing so because they are
fighting for independence.

29:44.779 --> 29:47.073
Because they're fighting, in
this case, for unification...

29:47.156 --> 29:49.283
and they're fighting
for revolution.

29:56.415 --> 30:01.420
Of course, the name
for a conflict...

30:01.546 --> 30:05.049
in which you're opposing a
revolution is counter-revolution.

30:05.174 --> 30:07.718
And this is something we never
admitted to ourselves at all.

30:07.844 --> 30:09.804
It's-It's what we
were really doing.

30:09.887 --> 30:13.516
The letters and the
reports we had...

30:13.641 --> 30:17.103
on Ho Chi Minh's attitude
back in 1946...

30:17.228 --> 30:21.607
he wrote I think it was seven letters to
this government and received no reply.

30:21.691 --> 30:26.821
The-The-The pathos, almost,
the sadness...

30:26.904 --> 30:30.324
Here's a man who felt
and believed the United States...

30:30.408 --> 30:33.744
would be sympathetic to his purpose
of gaining his independence...

30:33.870 --> 30:35.746
from a colonial power.

30:35.872 --> 30:39.000
And then to find we...
You know, this is what he'd read.

30:39.125 --> 30:42.587
He'd been here, read our Constitution
and Declaration of Independence.

30:42.712 --> 30:45.715
He thought surely the United States
would be interested.

30:45.840 --> 30:48.342
We had testimony in the
committee that his one worry...

30:48.468 --> 30:50.344
was that it was so insignificant...

30:50.470 --> 30:54.640
Vietnam was so far away, insignificant...
we would never bother about it.

30:54.724 --> 30:59.645
It's too small to ever attract the
attention of the United States.

30:59.729 --> 31:01.647
He was sure in his own mind...

31:01.731 --> 31:04.567
that if we ever put our minds in
focus upon it, we would be for him.

31:04.692 --> 31:09.155
How different history would have
been for us and for them...

31:09.238 --> 31:12.158
if we had felt a common interest...

31:12.241 --> 31:15.411
in the colonial province
like Vietnam...

31:15.536 --> 31:17.497
seeking its independence
from France.

31:18.706 --> 31:20.583
The Ho Chi Minh of '56,

31:20.708 --> 31:23.878
I don't think could have got elected
dogcatcher in South Vietnam.

31:24.003 --> 31:28.716
Ho Chi Minh, uh, dead...

31:28.800 --> 31:32.011
Could beat any candidate
we've ever put up in Vietnam.

31:34.806 --> 31:38.601
You asked me about
my oldest son Bing.

31:38.726 --> 31:43.397
He was a graduate of Harvard, 1965.

31:43.481 --> 31:46.400
And he was not a soldier at heart.

31:46.484 --> 31:50.571
Uh, but he realized,
I'm sure, there's no question,

31:50.696 --> 31:56.410
he realized he was part of a
big job that had to be done,

31:56.536 --> 32:00.957
and he was gonna do it the way
he did everything... full out.

32:01.040 --> 32:04.418
And he went out on this mission...
Minh River...

32:04.544 --> 32:07.463
and it was a big assault mission
bringing elements...

32:07.588 --> 32:11.801
to this area just south of Da Nang
along the railroad line.

32:11.926 --> 32:16.848
And they encountered heavy, sustained,
uh, automatic weapons fire.

32:16.973 --> 32:20.977
And the helicopter ahead of him,
I believe,

32:21.102 --> 32:25.356
was, uh, uh, destr...
was shot down.

32:25.481 --> 32:30.736
And then he went in
and his helicopter was, uh, uh...

32:30.820 --> 32:35.783
He was actually killed in flight.
That's what they...

32:35.867 --> 32:39.579
And the airplane crashed,
and he and his co... He was killed.

32:39.662 --> 32:42.331
His copilot was very badly injured.

32:42.457 --> 32:46.919
And I think there were 12 out of
15 or 16 of the people aboard...

32:47.003 --> 32:49.255
were either killed or badly hurt.

33:04.020 --> 33:06.314
Many bombs, many coffins.

33:07.648 --> 33:09.692
These are for children.

33:12.528 --> 33:16.824
Eight or nine hundred a week.
I have lost seven children myself.

33:19.327 --> 33:22.288
Many have died here.

33:22.371 --> 33:27.251
It's nothing like in the countryside.
Many more have died there.

33:31.297 --> 33:36.135
In the country, there are no coffins.
There's no money to buy them.

33:39.972 --> 33:41.933
How did all the children die?

33:44.435 --> 33:48.648
Poison. Poison, you know.

33:52.652 --> 33:58.324
These planes keep spouting and spraying
the stuff, and so many people have died.

34:00.576 --> 34:03.371
It seems to destroy
their intestines.

34:03.454 --> 34:07.375
With this spraying and bombing,
so many have died.

34:10.628 --> 34:14.590
Each day, right on time,
the bomb craters appear.

34:19.679 --> 34:22.639
Hundreds of tons
are dropped each day.

34:31.190 --> 34:33.818
And we can't talk about it.
We can't talk about it...

34:33.943 --> 34:36.445
because we are afraid
of the government.

34:55.130 --> 34:57.675
Come on.

35:05.933 --> 35:09.103
- You look nice.
- How do you feel?

35:09.187 --> 35:11.105
What'd you do?

35:11.189 --> 35:13.608
Uh, shaved.

35:13.733 --> 35:15.818
I liked it better long.

35:17.820 --> 35:20.323
So what you been doing?

35:23.117 --> 35:25.161
In little more than a week,

35:25.286 --> 35:28.456
I'll be going back to the military.

35:28.539 --> 35:31.459
You what?

35:31.542 --> 35:34.295
- Why?
- Well...

35:37.089 --> 35:40.051
After what they've done to you?

35:42.136 --> 35:44.806
Well, it's...

35:44.889 --> 35:47.308
it's a choice between that...

35:48.976 --> 35:52.438
or, uh, Canada, again.

35:54.190 --> 35:57.151
Or, uh, staying underground.

35:58.361 --> 36:00.988
Which is, uh, as you know,
impossible...

36:01.113 --> 36:04.033
- Have you been in contact with them?
- No.

36:04.158 --> 36:06.410
No. But I've got a lot of support.

36:06.536 --> 36:08.412
You'll get the same deal
Mike's getting.

36:08.538 --> 36:12.333
It's going to be a different type thing.
I'm going back publicly.

36:12.416 --> 36:16.337
We're having, uh,
Ad Hoc Congressional Hearings.

36:16.420 --> 36:17.380
Yeah?

36:17.505 --> 36:19.865
It's really been building up
over the past couple of months.

36:19.924 --> 36:24.303
- And...
- Am I going to be able to be there?

36:24.387 --> 36:28.474
Of course you're going to be there. I'm
gonna try to get Ronnie there, too.

36:28.558 --> 36:30.810
"Cause you know what
I feel about the army.

36:30.893 --> 36:35.189
These people holding their heads
high because they lost a son...

36:35.273 --> 36:37.191
in Vietnam or something.

36:37.275 --> 36:39.694
I don't think
that's much to be proud of.

36:42.321 --> 36:46.033
They've lost more than they'll ever
gain for the rest of their lives.

36:49.871 --> 36:53.875
And I remember I was sitting
at the base of the hill,

36:54.000 --> 36:56.669
and I was on one of the tanks.

36:56.752 --> 36:59.839
And I had an M-16,
and I had stacks of magazines.

36:59.922 --> 37:02.133
And there were two guys, you know,

37:02.258 --> 37:06.262
that were going through,
like, some grass and bam!

37:06.387 --> 37:09.432
I dinged in on one of 'em,
and I nailed him, you know.

37:09.557 --> 37:14.228
And the Aussie with me confirmed,
you know, that I dinged him.

37:14.312 --> 37:17.023
And I felt good. And I wanted more.

37:17.106 --> 37:22.111
And it wasn't that I wanted more
for politics or anything like that.

37:22.236 --> 37:25.865
No. I couldn't of cared
if they were whatever.

37:25.948 --> 37:30.411
I just wanted them because they
were the opposition, the enemy.

37:30.495 --> 37:34.123
Stinking little savages.
Wipe 'em out, I say.

37:34.248 --> 37:37.043
Wipe 'em out.
Wipe 'em off the face of the earth!

37:38.294 --> 37:40.755
Will we ever understand
these Eastern races?

37:40.880 --> 37:43.132
Hit me, Poon Soon.

37:47.261 --> 37:49.096
You hideous yellow monster!

37:49.180 --> 37:52.642
I wanted to go out
and kill some gooks, you know?

37:52.725 --> 37:57.480
I-I really... I-I don't know. I guess
I had been totally brainwashed,

37:57.605 --> 38:01.108
because I could remember when people
used to call me "blanket ass"...

38:01.234 --> 38:03.486
or "chief"
and they still did, you know?

38:03.611 --> 38:07.406
I think my name was, uh,
Ira Hayes in boot camp.

38:07.490 --> 38:11.410
Either Ira Hayes or squaw, depending on
what mood the drill instructor was in.

38:11.494 --> 38:14.789
But there I was, you know, saying
I wanted to go kill some gooks.

38:14.914 --> 38:19.794
They were instructed to remove
the eyes of the individual...

38:19.877 --> 38:22.505
and place them in a hole
in the middle of the back,

38:22.630 --> 38:25.299
and that would say to the
Vietnamese, you have to understand,

38:25.383 --> 38:28.261
uh, that whoever did that
was ubiquitous.

38:28.344 --> 38:30.972
In other words, the eye being
the symbol of ubiquity,

38:31.097 --> 38:34.809
uh, or of all-present, all-powerfulness
on the part of the Saigon government.

38:34.934 --> 38:39.063
Which is an easy message
for the local villagers to get.

38:39.188 --> 38:42.068
In fact, the American advisors didn't
have that much of a stomach for it.

38:42.191 --> 38:45.862
So they used to use CBS logos.

38:45.987 --> 38:47.947
You know, the eye of CBS?

38:48.030 --> 38:50.671
And they would kill the individual
and then they would leave him...

38:50.700 --> 38:52.660
with kind of a calling card on him.

38:52.785 --> 38:56.831
At one point, I was invited to go
along on an airborne interrogation...

38:56.956 --> 38:59.625
in a helicopter with the marines
northwest of Da Nang.

38:59.709 --> 39:02.003
And they took along two Vietnamese.

39:02.128 --> 39:05.923
And one was already reduced
by beatings with a rubber hose...

39:06.048 --> 39:09.177
and some other methods
of, uh, beating and torture...

39:09.302 --> 39:11.679
to the point where he couldn't
talk, he couldn't respond.

39:11.804 --> 39:16.225
As an example to the one they
wanted to question, they'd say,

39:16.350 --> 39:18.311
"If you don't tell us
what we want to know,

39:18.394 --> 39:20.396
we're gonna throw you
out of the helicopter."

39:20.521 --> 39:23.274
And, uh, he couldn't respond.
He didn't understand.

39:23.399 --> 39:26.819
They were using, uh, pigeon Vietnamese,
which he didn't understand.

39:26.903 --> 39:28.821
It was more English
than Vietnamese.

39:28.905 --> 39:31.657
They'd run him up to the helicopter...
two hefty E.M. were along...

39:31.741 --> 39:36.204
they'd take him by each elbow and run
him up to the door of the helicopter.

39:36.287 --> 39:39.707
They'd do this three or four times.
He was reduced to whimpering and crying.

39:39.791 --> 39:44.128
And they finally, um, uh, told
him that this was the last run.

39:44.253 --> 39:47.965
He still responded the same way, and
they winged him out of the helicopter.

39:48.090 --> 39:52.386
The second fellow
immediately started to babble.

39:52.470 --> 39:54.388
Anything he could tell them.

39:54.472 --> 39:57.767
Any kind of information
he could give them for one goal.

39:57.892 --> 40:00.019
And that was to reach the ground
alive again.

40:00.102 --> 40:03.356
I just can't see in my mind somebody
throwing somebody out of a helicopter.

40:03.439 --> 40:07.193
I don't believe this kind of stuff
happened. Maybe it did. I don't know.

40:07.276 --> 40:09.403
I never saw it, put it that way.

40:11.155 --> 40:16.619
I've seen G.I.'s get mad and, uh, uh,
rather than shoot one of these dinks,

40:16.744 --> 40:20.456
uh, just punch him right out, yeah,
with his hands.

40:22.750 --> 40:25.837
Americans say Vietnamese are
just slant-eyed savages.

40:25.962 --> 40:28.798
The Vietnamese have
5,000 years of history.

40:28.923 --> 40:33.719
We fight against the invaders.
It is not we who are the savages.

40:49.652 --> 40:51.821
I don't know where they are.
That's the worst thing.

40:51.946 --> 40:54.824
Right around and run into the sewers
and the gutters, anywhere.

40:54.949 --> 40:58.369
They can be anywhere. Just hopin'
you can stay alive from day to day.

40:58.494 --> 41:01.539
I just want to go back home
and go to school. That's about it.

41:01.664 --> 41:03.624
- Have you lost any friends?
- Quite a few.

41:03.749 --> 41:08.045
We lost one the other day.
The whole thing stinks.

41:12.341 --> 41:14.927
The dude in the foxhole with me,
he was dead.

41:15.011 --> 41:19.724
And, like, here come the jets.
Everybody's, "Yay, jets! Do it to 'em.

41:19.849 --> 41:22.059
Get these motherfuckers
off our ass." You know.

41:22.185 --> 41:24.604
'Cause they were diggin'
in our behind real good.

41:24.687 --> 41:28.024
And, like, the jet came in
and "Yay, jet, get 'em."

41:28.149 --> 41:30.860
And you see 'em swoopin' all around.
"Yay, jet, get 'em."

41:30.985 --> 41:34.238
And he came over that way and let
it go, and you say, "Uh-oh."

41:34.363 --> 41:37.492
And you could see it's napalm
cannister, because you can tell 'em.

41:37.575 --> 41:41.454
They spin asshole over head, backwards
as they're tumbling through the air.

41:41.537 --> 41:45.124
And the thing is just tumbling down.
You know it's coming right at you.

41:45.208 --> 41:48.669
You know. And, like, wow. The
napalm hit, I grabbed this dude,

41:48.795 --> 41:51.297
just put him up over my head
in the hole like that.

41:51.380 --> 41:55.218
Fuckin' napalm went down the whole line.
Just creamed everybody in the line.

41:55.343 --> 41:58.846
Thirty-five dudes, man, just burnt.
Post-toasty to the bitter, you dig?

41:58.971 --> 42:01.432
And that napalm was just drippin'
on both sides of this dude.

42:01.557 --> 42:04.268
He's dead, you know. I'm just holdin'
him up, using him as a shield.

42:04.393 --> 42:07.522
I just chunked this dude off of me
and just sprung out of the hole.

42:07.605 --> 42:10.149
I didn't know which way I was going
outside of back, you dig?

42:10.274 --> 42:12.193
And just ran through.
Burned my pants off.

42:12.276 --> 42:15.822
Spent the rest of the battle running
with no drawers. My stuff hanging out.

42:15.905 --> 42:18.825
You ever try to fight a battle
without any drawers on, man?

42:20.910 --> 42:23.996
Awful sick of it.
I'll be so glad to go home.

42:24.080 --> 42:28.876
I don't know. It's the worst area we've
been in since I've been in Vietnam.

42:29.001 --> 42:31.087
You think it's worth it?

42:31.212 --> 42:35.675
Yeah. I don't know. They say we're
fighting for something. I don't know.

42:35.800 --> 42:40.429
I was at a very kind of
sobering thing last night.

42:40.555 --> 42:43.391
Memorial service for four men
in the second squadron...

42:43.516 --> 42:45.476
who were killed the other day.

42:45.601 --> 42:47.770
One of them being a medic.

42:47.895 --> 42:50.481
And, uh, the place was just packed.

42:50.606 --> 42:53.568
And we sang three hymns
and had a nice prayer.

42:53.651 --> 42:57.530
I turned around, looked at
their faces, and they were...

42:57.613 --> 43:02.869
I was just proud.
My-My, uh, feeling for America...

43:02.952 --> 43:05.079
just soared because of their...

43:05.163 --> 43:07.457
The way they looked.
They looked determined...

43:07.582 --> 43:10.585
and-and-and reverent
at the same time.

43:10.710 --> 43:15.131
But still they're
a bloody good bunch of killers.

43:16.632 --> 43:20.094
"When you go forth to war
against your enemies...

43:20.219 --> 43:25.057
and see horses and chariots
in an army larger than your own,

43:25.141 --> 43:28.436
you shall not be afraid."

43:28.519 --> 43:32.064
Well, let's not anybody
be so naive as to think we're here,

43:32.190 --> 43:35.276
in any way, to worship football.

43:36.777 --> 43:41.032
Nor are we here,
as I'm sure many people believe,

43:41.157 --> 43:44.076
to pray for a victory.

43:45.328 --> 43:47.497
We believe in victory.

43:47.622 --> 43:50.458
We believe it will come to the team
that's best prepared.

43:50.541 --> 43:54.086
This is serious business
that we're involved in.

43:54.212 --> 43:57.840
And that's religious,
and God cares.

43:57.965 --> 44:02.053
There are going to
be men made tonight.

44:02.178 --> 44:05.139
And that's religious,
and God cares about that.

44:08.935 --> 44:11.604
We're concerned about the big game.

44:13.314 --> 44:15.483
But we're also concerned
about the bigger game,

44:15.608 --> 44:20.112
the biggest game of all that
surrounds us: The game of life.

44:22.240 --> 44:24.659
May you be winners.

44:24.784 --> 44:27.161
Winners in the big game.

44:27.245 --> 44:31.999
But even more importantly,
winners in the biggest game of all,

44:32.125 --> 44:35.503
which we all play. Let us pray.

44:39.674 --> 44:41.008
That's a touchdown.

44:44.679 --> 44:48.307
Because we got our kids
geared to crack like hell.

44:54.647 --> 44:59.152
Holding, number 37.

45:11.664 --> 45:14.167
You got to tell them
they're number one, no matter what.

45:14.250 --> 45:17.462
- You're number one.

45:17.587 --> 45:21.507
Wow. Why don't you just say "wow"?

45:21.591 --> 45:25.094
- Say what?
- 'Toy hoy" means "wow"?

45:25.219 --> 45:27.096
- Toy hoy?
- Yeah.

45:27.221 --> 45:31.058
Like, toy hoy means,
like, wow, you know?

45:31.142 --> 45:33.895
- Look at the hickeys I gave this chick.
- You gave her hickeys?

45:33.978 --> 45:36.022
- Yeah.
- I can imagine. Where?

45:36.105 --> 45:39.901
Uh, one on each side.

45:40.026 --> 45:43.863
- It's a place where she can't hide 'em.
- Oh, really?

45:43.946 --> 45:47.241
See, this one? I gave her this one.

45:47.325 --> 45:49.327
And this one,
this is the first one right there.

45:49.452 --> 45:52.163
It came out kind of
nasty, you know.

45:52.288 --> 45:55.124
- And... No can do, I know.
- Maybe he's dead.

45:55.249 --> 45:58.085
- He's not dead. Wake him up.
- No can wakey up.

45:58.211 --> 46:00.546
Why?

46:00.630 --> 46:04.300
- Wakey him up. He no hard.
- Huh? Why he's no hard?

46:04.425 --> 46:06.302
- Uh-huh.
- 'Cause you no wake him up.

46:06.427 --> 46:09.639
Hey, Charles.
You getting anything out of yours?

46:09.764 --> 46:14.435
This one's, uh, kind of sour on me,
you know? Uh...

46:14.560 --> 46:17.230
- Well, keep her going, man.
- Huh?

46:17.313 --> 46:20.149
- Keep her going.
- I'm trying to.

46:20.274 --> 46:22.944
You know what it is about
these chicks down here,

46:23.069 --> 46:27.073
like, they're, uh...
Well, what would you want to do...

46:27.198 --> 46:29.492
except for, you know,
have a ball with them.

46:29.617 --> 46:32.537
- And, uh... Right?
- Right.

46:32.662 --> 46:34.622
You're number one.

46:34.705 --> 46:37.458
This one's got
a set of knockers, man.

46:37.542 --> 46:40.002
This one does, too, but she
won't take her goddamn bra off.

46:40.128 --> 46:41.087
Take it off for her.

46:41.212 --> 46:43.131
Take it off for her?

46:43.214 --> 46:45.925
- That's the name of the game.
- Here, you don't want this.

46:46.008 --> 46:49.011
I know. I know what you want.

46:49.137 --> 46:51.597
- Hey. Hey, Charles. Charles.
- What?

46:51.722 --> 46:54.892
Yeah? It's about time.

46:58.479 --> 47:00.356
Ah, you don't be mad at me, okay?

47:00.481 --> 47:02.859
It took you long enough,
you know that?

47:11.033 --> 47:14.537
- Oh, yeah. Check it out, baby.
- Check it out later, man.

47:14.662 --> 47:16.956
Check it out later? Mm!

47:31.721 --> 47:35.683
You know, if my chick at home could
see this now, man, she'd flip.

48:05.963 --> 48:09.383
One more. Yeah, this man here.

48:19.310 --> 48:21.229
Hurry up down that tunnel.

48:21.312 --> 48:23.606
Let's make a quick
check and let's go.

48:32.782 --> 48:35.618
Okay, well, hurry it up
and check it out quickly.

49:22.498 --> 49:24.375
Some people enjoy it, some don't.

49:24.500 --> 49:28.796
Some just go out and do it as a job.
It's a daily grind.

49:28.880 --> 49:31.924
- What is it for you?
- I enjoy it.

49:42.560 --> 49:47.899
Now I know that he will have a very
important message for each one of us,

49:48.024 --> 49:51.235
so I want you all
to listen very attentively...

49:51.360 --> 49:54.113
to what he has to say to you.

49:54.197 --> 49:56.741
- Lieutenant Coker.
- If you ever have to go to a war,

49:56.866 --> 50:00.495
and unfortunately, someday you
probably will have to fight a war,

50:01.829 --> 50:05.166
you'll find out
that life becomes very simple.

50:05.249 --> 50:09.545
Because the only thing you're
concerned about is living and dying.

50:09.670 --> 50:15.676
Everything else is unimportant, because
suddenly your life is at stake.

50:15.760 --> 50:20.056
And that's what it's like to be
when you become a prisoner,

50:20.181 --> 50:22.350
particularly, a prisoner of war.

50:22.433 --> 50:25.686
Because the thing that got us through
were the things we learned...

50:25.770 --> 50:28.815
before we were ten years old.

50:28.940 --> 50:31.192
I'd like to open up
to questions now.

50:31.275 --> 50:34.654
Just raise your hand or yell it out and
you can ask any question you want.

50:34.737 --> 50:37.573
And I'll do the best I can
to answer them.

50:39.117 --> 50:42.161
How did you feel when
the Vietnam war was over?

50:42.245 --> 50:44.956
How did I feel
when the war was over?

50:45.081 --> 50:47.792
I felt real good. Real good.

50:47.917 --> 50:51.420
It was a long war and a very
difficult war to understand.

50:51.546 --> 50:55.591
But the reason we went there
was to win this war.

50:55.716 --> 50:59.095
I volunteered to go.
I'd go again if I had to.

50:59.220 --> 51:02.306
And we wanted to win.
That was our number one ambition.

51:02.431 --> 51:04.851
That's what we really wanted,
was to win this war.

51:04.934 --> 51:08.437
And it took us a long time.
So when we knew that we had won,

51:08.563 --> 51:11.524
we felt great;
we really felt great.

51:11.649 --> 51:16.028
- What did Vietnam look like?
- What did Vietnam look like.

51:16.112 --> 51:19.615
Well, if it wasn't for the people,
it was very pretty.

51:19.740 --> 51:21.909
Uh, the people over there are
very backward and very primitive.

51:22.034 --> 51:24.245
And they just make a mess
out of everything.

51:26.164 --> 51:28.332
How did you... How did you, um...

51:28.458 --> 51:30.918
What do you feel about
the people that, um,

51:31.002 --> 51:34.005
went and burned their draft cards
and went into Canada?

51:34.130 --> 51:37.425
We don't agree with them. I think
these people were legally wrong.

51:37.508 --> 51:40.553
I think sometimes
they were cowards.

51:40.636 --> 51:44.140
If they wanted to leave
and go to Canada, that's okay.

51:44.265 --> 51:47.185
But they can't come back, though,
because they have disagreed.

51:47.310 --> 51:50.438
They say, "We don't like your
country, we don't like your people."

51:50.521 --> 51:52.440
They're saying that to you and me.

51:52.523 --> 51:54.442
"I don't like you, so I'm leaving."

51:54.525 --> 51:58.529
Well, fine, that's okay. There's
no reason to hate a guy for that.

51:58.654 --> 52:02.283
'Cause that's also his right,
but he can't come back.

52:02.366 --> 52:06.078
Instead of helping and aiding
the Vietnamese people,

52:06.162 --> 52:10.917
I saw that we were party to their
deliberate and systematic destruction.

52:11.000 --> 52:16.422
The Vietnamese were considered,
less than humans, inferiors.

52:16.506 --> 52:19.801
We called them "gooks," "slopes."

52:19.926 --> 52:23.471
Their lives weren't worth anything to us
because we'd been taught to believe...

52:23.596 --> 52:26.682
that they were all fanatical
and that they were all V. C...

52:26.808 --> 52:29.477
or V.C. sympathizers,
even the children.

52:29.602 --> 52:31.479
Many of us, however,
began to understand...

52:31.604 --> 52:34.106
through our personal
experiences in Vietnam...

52:34.232 --> 52:37.819
the depth of the lies and
deceptions practiced upon us,

52:37.944 --> 52:41.447
and the American people,
by our country's leaders.

52:41.531 --> 52:44.700
It was they who trained us
to kill without question...

52:44.826 --> 52:47.912
and to hate our enemy...
the Vietnamese.

52:48.037 --> 52:52.458
They concocted such phrases
as "kill ratios", "search and destroy",

52:52.542 --> 52:56.587
"free fire zones",
"secure areas", and so on...

52:56.712 --> 53:01.717
to mask the reality
of their combat policy in Vietnam.

53:01.843 --> 53:04.679
I make no apology
for this act of resistance.

53:04.804 --> 53:07.515
I could do nothing else
at the time.

53:07.640 --> 53:10.560
But underground life
has become intolerable to me.

53:10.685 --> 53:16.107
So I'm here today to draw attention
to the true facts concerning my case...

53:16.232 --> 53:20.027
and the cases of tens of thousands
just like me.

53:20.111 --> 53:23.406
We are not criminals
to be hunted and imprisoned.

53:23.531 --> 53:29.036
Over a half million of us have
deserted the military since 1965.

53:29.162 --> 53:31.539
Most of us have already returned
to the military...

53:31.664 --> 53:34.167
to be punished with jail
and bad discharges...

53:34.250 --> 53:37.420
that will be carried around
for the rest of our lives.

53:37.545 --> 53:41.883
And it is a supreme irony to be
prosecuted by the very same men...

53:42.008 --> 53:46.053
who planned and executed
a genocidal war in Indochina.

53:46.179 --> 53:50.057
Now, inside this hearing room,
Eddie Sowders has surrendered himself.

53:50.183 --> 53:54.103
Urged on, he says, by a hand-to-mouth
underground existence...

53:54.228 --> 53:57.440
that still nags at many
of his fellow deserters...

53:57.565 --> 53:59.734
who continue to look
over their shoulders.

53:59.817 --> 54:02.695
Paul Udell, NBC News, Washington.

54:05.323 --> 54:07.617
- How was your sound?
- One more time.

54:09.744 --> 54:11.954
Let me respectfully
tell the American people...

54:12.079 --> 54:15.041
that this is their dirtiest
and longest war.

54:15.124 --> 54:17.752
The Vietnamese fight
only in self-defense.

54:17.835 --> 54:21.339
Ultimately, the Americans
will see the light.

54:21.464 --> 54:24.383
If not, they will
defeat themselves.

54:24.467 --> 54:28.805
You know, Vietnam, uh,
reminded me of a... of a child,

54:28.930 --> 54:31.349
the developing of a child.

54:31.432 --> 54:34.977
The laws of nature control
the development of this child.

54:35.102 --> 54:37.021
A child has to sit up
before it crawls.

54:37.146 --> 54:39.106
It has to crawl before it walks.

54:39.190 --> 54:41.234
It has to walk before it runs.

54:44.987 --> 54:47.615
No matter how
many decades America fights,

54:53.871 --> 54:57.959
I'm telling you so that you will go
back and repeat it to President Nixon.

55:01.712 --> 55:05.967
Over here, as long as there is
rice to eat, we'll keep fighting.

55:06.050 --> 55:11.180
And if the rice runs out, then we'll
plow the fields and fight again.

55:11.305 --> 55:14.892
I know very little about it
over there, I'll tell ya.

55:15.017 --> 55:18.104
And the less I know,
the better off I'll be.

55:18.187 --> 55:20.189
It has not affected me a whole lot.

55:20.314 --> 55:23.401
I mean, the American...
The way of life is still here.

55:23.484 --> 55:26.279
And if you work for it,
it's there for you.

55:26.362 --> 55:29.907
We're taught that we're
to obey our government,

55:30.032 --> 55:33.035
and I would have to go
if I was instructed to.

55:33.161 --> 55:35.037
Once in a while, I think about it,

55:35.163 --> 55:38.833
but I like to think about the things
that are happening right now to me.

55:38.916 --> 55:41.836
I don't it's affected mine at all.

55:41.919 --> 55:45.673
I don't even know who we're fighting for
over there, to be real honest with you.

55:45.756 --> 55:48.843
I think we're fighting
for the North Vietnamese, ain't we?

55:53.347 --> 55:57.435
I fled from Dau Tien
to go live in Suoi Dua.

55:59.103 --> 56:02.482
Then I was allowed to go back,
and I went back...

56:02.565 --> 56:04.984
and stayed in Ben Chua.

56:06.611 --> 56:10.573
While I was in Ben Chua,
trouble broke out again.

56:10.698 --> 56:14.619
So I was taken up to Co Tach.

56:14.744 --> 56:17.747
I was picked up again
and sent to Ben Chua...

56:17.872 --> 56:20.249
to be lumped together
with the others.

56:24.587 --> 56:29.425
My house burned down
while I was away.

56:29.550 --> 56:31.594
Once more, I got sent to Co Tach.

56:34.263 --> 56:39.227
I've fled five, six,
at least seven times already.

56:41.187 --> 56:46.400
The lives of my countrymen are
worth no more than that of a fly.

56:46.484 --> 56:50.029
You take it and swat it dead...

56:50.113 --> 56:52.115
just like that.

57:26.357 --> 57:29.610
Ladies, listen to me.

57:29.694 --> 57:34.407
There were some women amusing themselves
and one pushed the other onto a table.

57:34.490 --> 57:37.785
The lady's falsies
broke the table in two.

57:39.829 --> 57:44.709
If a table breaks, think of what
would happen to a man's face.

57:46.377 --> 57:49.380
Watch it, they're filming.
Don't joke.

57:49.505 --> 57:52.633
People in America
will think we're ridiculous.

57:55.595 --> 57:58.097
We have about 15 companies now,

57:58.222 --> 58:03.311
including an insurance company
and a tractor company.

58:03.436 --> 58:07.482
We are in the hotel business,
in the travel agency business.

58:07.607 --> 58:12.320
We are the exclusive dealer
for Ford in the country, Ford cars.

58:12.445 --> 58:15.114
Oh, many, many other things,

58:15.198 --> 58:17.116
like, uh, an oil company
in the forming.

58:17.200 --> 58:21.162
We, uh, have a bottling company.
In other words, uh,

58:21.287 --> 58:24.832
we greatly... we greatly believe
in the future of this country,

58:24.957 --> 58:27.794
and, uh, we think
there's a great future for Vietnam.

58:27.877 --> 58:31.881
And, uh, we think
that Vietnam will be liveable,

58:32.006 --> 58:34.050
will not go communist,

58:34.175 --> 58:36.552
because otherwise, all these
companies will go to waste.

58:36.677 --> 58:40.348
And the way we work
is we take a calculated risk.

58:40.473 --> 58:44.435
If we don't lose South Vietnam
within the next three to five years,

58:44.560 --> 58:46.687
then nobody can catch up with us.

58:46.771 --> 58:51.984
I'm a Johnny-come-lately as far
as war profiteering is concerned.

58:53.152 --> 58:55.863
Uh, the reason why I...

58:55.947 --> 59:00.993
uh, organized this group of companies
is because when I was in Paris,

59:01.077 --> 59:04.664
I saw that peace was coming,
whether we liked it or not.

59:04.789 --> 59:08.709
Therefore, I got home
in order to prepare for peace.

59:08.793 --> 59:14.298
All these companies have been organized
in order to prepare for peace...

59:14.423 --> 59:18.553
and prepare for the economic
takeoff that will come with peace.

59:18.636 --> 59:23.224
We have the infrastructure of hotels, of
travel agencies and things like that.

59:23.349 --> 59:27.687
But, of course, there are no tourists
in Vietnam now. But there will be.

59:27.770 --> 59:31.232
And, uh, we are getting
ready for that sort of thing.

59:48.291 --> 59:50.251
Does it feel comfortable?

01:00:41.803 --> 01:00:46.015
Keep it flat. Just like you
do with your good leg.

01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:48.559
Now try to walk.

01:00:56.526 --> 01:00:59.570
Well, it really isn't that much.
We were just walking and...

01:00:59.695 --> 01:01:04.575
We were walking on a patrol
and, uh, we ran into an ambush.

01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:06.577
About six, seven guys
really got hurt.

01:01:06.702 --> 01:01:10.081
Ran into a battalion ambush,
they said it was.

01:01:10.164 --> 01:01:14.585
And it was supposed to be one of the
biggest ambushes of Tet season.

01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:20.591
And we called in two or three
medivacs, and they got hit.

01:01:20.716 --> 01:01:24.595
So, finally, the last one
came in and got us out.

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:28.766
From that, I never saw any of the others
I was with, except for one or two.

01:01:28.850 --> 01:01:30.768
And that was about it.

01:01:30.852 --> 01:01:34.480
Most of the guys I keep in touch
with are guys in the hospital.

01:01:34.564 --> 01:01:36.774
They usually have a reunion
once a year.

01:01:40.403 --> 01:01:43.197
That's about it. There's really
not that much to talk about.

01:01:46.325 --> 01:01:51.873
Here we are for one thing that we
said, and I don't give a shit now.

01:01:51.998 --> 01:01:54.375
I don't care
about the football game now.

01:01:54.459 --> 01:01:56.627
I don't care about anything now.

01:01:56.752 --> 01:02:00.631
The one thing that we wanna show these
bastards with Masillon pride...

01:02:00.756 --> 01:02:03.134
is that we come down and show
'em a great Masillon effort.

01:02:03.217 --> 01:02:06.304
And what the piss you doing?
What are ya doing?

01:02:06.429 --> 01:02:08.306
Get going! Goddamn it, Tony!

01:02:08.431 --> 01:02:10.641
Don't let 'em beat us!
Don't let 'em beat us!

01:02:10.766 --> 01:02:12.643
Let's go! Show 'em Masillon pride.

01:02:12.768 --> 01:02:15.146
- Come on! Go!
- Go!

01:02:15.229 --> 01:02:17.607
Go, go, go, go!

01:02:32.288 --> 01:02:34.373
Get him! Get him!

01:02:42.215 --> 01:02:44.425
Make no mistake about it.

01:02:46.052 --> 01:02:48.179
I don't want a man in here...

01:02:48.262 --> 01:02:51.682
To go back home thinking otherwise.

01:02:51.808 --> 01:02:54.101
We are going to win.

01:03:15.456 --> 01:03:17.291
Go, motherfucker! Go!

01:03:17.375 --> 01:03:19.293
Since the Lunar New Year,

01:03:19.377 --> 01:03:22.213
the Vietcong and North Vietnamese
have proved they are capable...

01:03:22.296 --> 01:03:24.799
of bold and impressive
military moves...

01:03:24.924 --> 01:03:27.718
that Americans here
never dreamed could be achieved.

01:03:27.844 --> 01:03:32.306
Whether the Vietcong can sustain this
onslaught long remains to be seen,

01:03:32.431 --> 01:03:34.642
but whatever turn
this war now takes,

01:03:34.767 --> 01:03:37.895
the capture of the U.S. Embassy
in Saigon for seven hours...

01:03:37.979 --> 01:03:41.399
will be a story to rally
and inspire the Vietcong.

01:03:41.482 --> 01:03:46.112
Don North, ABC news,
at the U.S. Embassy in Saigon.

01:03:46.195 --> 01:03:50.408
I know that, as was the case in the
Battle of the Bulge in World War II,

01:03:50.491 --> 01:03:53.411
that after the enemy exposed
himself, we would defeat him.

01:03:53.494 --> 01:03:57.331
He would be weakened, and
we could follow that up.

01:03:57.457 --> 01:03:59.750
Through the use of, uh,

01:03:59.876 --> 01:04:03.921
the maximum military force that
we could bring to bear on him,

01:04:04.005 --> 01:04:06.924
through the bombing, through
the mining of the harbors,

01:04:07.008 --> 01:04:09.427
through the cutting of his
lines of communication,

01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:11.762
by moving in and cleaning
out his sanctuaries,

01:04:11.888 --> 01:04:14.182
the enemy would have no choice...

01:04:14.265 --> 01:04:16.309
but to come to some accommodation.

01:04:16.392 --> 01:04:18.853
In the beginning of 1968,

01:04:18.978 --> 01:04:22.940
General Westmoreland needed
206,000 more troops.

01:04:23.024 --> 01:04:26.027
We met hour after hour after
hour in the Pentagon.

01:04:26.110 --> 01:04:31.741
And I started in and asked
the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

01:04:31.866 --> 01:04:34.494
"How long do you think that
we'll still be in the war?"

01:04:34.577 --> 01:04:36.704
None of them knew.

01:04:36.829 --> 01:04:41.209
"Uh, do you think that the
206,000 men will be enough?"

01:04:41.292 --> 01:04:43.211
Nobody knew.

01:04:43.294 --> 01:04:47.298
"Uh, might we have to send
more men?" "Well, possibly."

01:04:47.381 --> 01:04:49.300
"Well, in six months?"
"We don't know."

01:04:49.383 --> 01:04:51.052
"A year? Eighteen months?"

01:04:51.177 --> 01:04:53.721
I couldn't get answers
to these questions.

01:04:53.846 --> 01:04:57.809
By the end of that
four-day interrogation,

01:04:57.934 --> 01:05:01.729
I was getting down... by the end of it...
into very serious questions,

01:05:01.854 --> 01:05:07.151
"Do any of you men, as you
look at it objectively,

01:05:07.235 --> 01:05:12.657
do you find any diminution in the
will of the enemy to fight?"

01:05:12.782 --> 01:05:14.992
Well, they said,
"No, we guess we don't."

01:05:15.076 --> 01:05:18.496
"Are they sending the same number of men
down through the Ho Chi Minh trail?"

01:05:18.579 --> 01:05:22.500
"Well, yes, and even they
might be a little more."

01:05:22.583 --> 01:05:27.505
"And how about our bombing? We've
placed great reliance on our bombing.

01:05:27.588 --> 01:05:29.924
Is our bombing stopping them?"
"No."

01:05:30.007 --> 01:05:33.427
"Well, what is the amount of attrition
that our bombing's causing?"

01:05:33.553 --> 01:05:36.764
"Well, maybe 10 to 15 percent."

01:05:36.889 --> 01:05:39.183
So I remember asking one question.

01:05:39.267 --> 01:05:44.605
"If a North Vietnamese field commander
in South Vietnam needed 1,000 men..."

01:05:44.689 --> 01:05:46.607
They said, "Yes."

01:05:46.691 --> 01:05:52.321
"If he asked for, say, 1,200
men, 1,000 would get through?"

01:05:52.447 --> 01:05:54.323
"Well, that's right."

01:05:54.449 --> 01:05:57.869
'then he'd have the thousand he
needed." "Well, yes. That's so."

01:05:57.994 --> 01:06:03.207
Well, this type of interrogation...
Finally, by the end of four or five days,

01:06:03.291 --> 01:06:06.043
I must say that my thinking...

01:06:06.127 --> 01:06:10.256
had undergone a very
substantial revolution.

01:06:27.231 --> 01:06:30.485
Come on, everybody!

01:06:45.708 --> 01:06:49.253
As long as the
American President...

01:06:49.337 --> 01:06:52.799
is commander in chief...

01:06:52.882 --> 01:06:58.596
of the biggest war machine
in human history,

01:06:58.679 --> 01:07:04.602
with bases on every continent, we
are going to get into trouble.

01:07:04.685 --> 01:07:10.066
Our enemy is the growing
militarization of American life.

01:07:10.191 --> 01:07:14.028
Our enemy is American imperialism.

01:07:14.153 --> 01:07:16.447
And there is an awakening.

01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:21.953
The enemy was on the ropes after
the Tet offensive was over.

01:07:22.078 --> 01:07:24.539
And it's like two
boxers in the ring.

01:07:24.664 --> 01:07:26.791
One boxer has the other
one on the ropes,

01:07:26.874 --> 01:07:29.794
but the man who is about
to be the victor...

01:07:29.877 --> 01:07:32.380
has his second throw the towel in.

01:07:32.463 --> 01:07:34.507
Accordingly,

01:07:36.008 --> 01:07:38.010
I shall not seek...

01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:41.973
and I will not accept...

01:07:42.098 --> 01:07:45.893
the nomination of my party for
another term as your president.

01:07:46.936 --> 01:07:48.855
I don't think we
helped 'em one bit.

01:07:48.938 --> 01:07:51.649
All I think we've done is destroyed
their country, laid it waste.

01:07:51.732 --> 01:07:54.402
No. I don't think we helped 'em.

01:07:54.527 --> 01:07:58.072
As fellow human beings, I don't think
they should be there doing that.

01:07:58.197 --> 01:08:00.700
Certainly a mature person can
say they made a mistake.

01:08:00.783 --> 01:08:02.243
Why can't a government?

01:08:02.368 --> 01:08:06.747
You let us all go off to war and said,
"Yea, team. Fight in Vietnam,"

01:08:06.873 --> 01:08:09.667
and all this kinda shit
in 1965 through 1968.

01:08:09.750 --> 01:08:14.172
Now 1968 comes along and "Boo, team.
Come on home," and all this shit.

01:08:14.255 --> 01:08:17.008
"And don't say nothin' about it, 'cause
we don't want to hear about it...

01:08:17.091 --> 01:08:19.010
'cause it's upsetting
around dinnertime."

01:08:19.093 --> 01:08:21.345
Well, Goddamn. It upset me
for a whole goddamn year.

01:08:21.429 --> 01:08:24.389
It upset a lot of people to the point
where they're fuckin' dead, you know?

01:08:24.432 --> 01:08:27.350
All this shit. You don't wanna hear
about it? I'll tell you every day.

01:08:27.435 --> 01:08:29.854
Make you sit out and puke
on your dinner, you dig?

01:08:29.937 --> 01:08:32.857
Because you got me over there, and
now you done brought me back here...

01:08:32.939 --> 01:08:36.027
and you wanna forget it so somebody
else can go do it somewhere else.

01:08:36.109 --> 01:08:38.196
Hell no. Uh-uh.
You gonna hear it all.

01:08:38.279 --> 01:08:42.533
Every day as long as you live, because
it's gonna be with me as long as I live.

01:08:42.617 --> 01:08:44.743
When I get up in the morning,
when John gets up,

01:08:44.827 --> 01:08:46.871
when a lot of dudes
sitting here get up,

01:08:46.953 --> 01:08:49.040
man, their gut hurts
because they got shot there.

01:08:49.122 --> 01:08:52.042
I gotta put on an arm and a leg, 'cause
it ain't there no more, you dig?

01:08:52.126 --> 01:08:55.546
Now, my man's got a hole in his stomach.
He can't work right, you know?

01:08:55.630 --> 01:08:59.050
You do something about that.
Make that all disappear, you dig?

01:08:59.133 --> 01:09:01.051
Make it all go away
with the 6:00 news.

01:09:01.135 --> 01:09:03.720
Turn it off or switch it
to another channel.

01:09:03.805 --> 01:09:07.058
Uh-Uh. To hell with that, you dig?
It's here and it's for real.

01:09:07.140 --> 01:09:10.060
And it's gonna happen again unless
these folks get off their ass...

01:09:10.144 --> 01:09:12.145
and realize it has happened.

01:09:18.319 --> 01:09:22.740
The country is ready to pass
a reasoned judgment on this war.

01:09:22.823 --> 01:09:26.577
The people have judged, I think,
that it's unwise and immoral...

01:09:26.661 --> 01:09:29.412
and not in the national interest
of this country...

01:09:29.497 --> 01:09:31.999
and that, therefore,
it must be brought to an end.

01:09:36.212 --> 01:09:39.756
For 20 years, first the French,
and then the United States...

01:09:39.841 --> 01:09:43.094
had been predicting
victory in Vietnam.

01:09:43.176 --> 01:09:46.264
In 1961 and in 1962,

01:09:46.346 --> 01:09:49.767
as well as 1966 and 1967,

01:09:49.850 --> 01:09:52.270
we have been told
that the tide is turning,

01:09:52.353 --> 01:09:57.442
there is a light at the end of the tunnel,
we can soon bring our troops home,

01:09:57.525 --> 01:10:00.528
victory is near, the
enemy is tiring.

01:10:00.611 --> 01:10:02.655
Once, in 1962,

01:10:02.738 --> 01:10:07.285
I participated
in such a prediction myself.

01:10:07.368 --> 01:10:10.455
But for 20 years,
we have been wrong.

01:10:10.538 --> 01:10:12.957
The history of conflict
among nations...

01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:18.129
does not record another such lengthy
and consistent chronicle of error...

01:10:18.212 --> 01:10:20.715
as we have shown in Vietnam.

01:10:20.798 --> 01:10:23.718
I had just given the policy line,

01:10:23.843 --> 01:10:27.305
stayed up all night with
Adam Walinsky and Peter Edelman,

01:10:27.388 --> 01:10:29.307
helping on a speech
for Robert Kennedy...

01:10:29.390 --> 01:10:33.019
which proved to be his last speech
given in San Francisco here...

01:10:33.144 --> 01:10:36.314
to a businessman's
luncheon on Vietnam.

01:10:36.397 --> 01:10:40.735
Uh, I went up with some corrections
last thing in the morning...

01:10:40.818 --> 01:10:44.155
and shook hands with him in his
bathrobe as he stood there.

01:10:44.238 --> 01:10:47.825
And then he came down from the
Ambassador Hotel and got into a car.

01:10:47.909 --> 01:10:52.163
We were struck with how easy
it was to get onto that floor...

01:10:52.246 --> 01:10:54.165
and approach him at that point.

01:10:54.248 --> 01:10:56.250
At the conference on
lessons on Vietnam,

01:10:56.334 --> 01:10:59.587
of course, in the morning I learned
that Robert Kennedy had died.

01:11:06.093 --> 01:11:08.221
Well...

01:11:10.598 --> 01:11:12.934
So...

01:11:13.059 --> 01:11:15.770
So, uh...

01:11:20.108 --> 01:11:24.278
Well, that was a way for a lot
of people to feel powerless.

01:11:34.789 --> 01:11:37.208
So, um,

01:11:37.291 --> 01:11:40.753
it began to look as if there was
no way to change this country.

01:12:33.973 --> 01:12:36.851
We'd been going down this
road for so many years,

01:12:36.976 --> 01:12:41.105
and I had felt so strongly before
that this was the right policy,

01:12:41.189 --> 01:12:43.775
that it was difficult
for me to change.

01:12:43.858 --> 01:12:49.238
I know now that the domino
theory was a false theory.

01:12:49.363 --> 01:12:53.993
I know now that we should
not have become involved.

01:12:54.076 --> 01:12:58.956
As far as I'm concerned today, I
have no hesitancy whatsoever...

01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:05.213
in saying I could not have been more wrong...
in my attitude toward Vietnam.

01:13:10.301 --> 01:13:14.555
Ground combat, Vietnamese cross
of gallantry with a silver star,

01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:19.977
gallantry in ground combat, four air
medals, an "I was there" ribbon.

01:13:25.566 --> 01:13:28.486
I got a colonel that's flying upstairs,
and he's gettin' down on me...

01:13:28.569 --> 01:13:32.323
and he's saying, 'take the hill,
take the hill, take the hill."

01:13:32.406 --> 01:13:35.493
So I got together
with the tank commander...

01:13:35.576 --> 01:13:37.829
and I said,
"Look, let's take three tanks...

01:13:37.912 --> 01:13:40.832
and we'll walk the A.R.V.N.
Up the hill, you know?

01:13:40.915 --> 01:13:44.085
And we'll lay down a base of fire
as we're going."

01:13:44.210 --> 01:13:47.505
He says, "Okay." I got with the
A.R.V.N. And says, "Let's fly."

01:13:47.588 --> 01:13:53.136
So I popped up behind the lead tank...
and, uh, started to go up the hill.

01:13:53.261 --> 01:13:57.598
And everything was cool,
until we started taking fire.

01:13:57.723 --> 01:14:00.935
And, uh, the A.R.V.N.
started to split.

01:14:03.104 --> 01:14:05.273
And that's when I got it.

01:14:05.398 --> 01:14:10.278
I said, "Oh, my God. I'm hit."
I couldn't believe it, you know?

01:14:10.403 --> 01:14:12.530
"I can't believe it.
I'm really hit."

01:14:12.613 --> 01:14:17.910
And my first, first thought...
was Kay, my girl, you know?

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:24.125
It's gonna sound stupid, but I'm...
but my thought was "she'll kill me."

01:14:24.250 --> 01:14:27.920
You know, here I was dying and I was
worried that she was gonna kill me.

01:14:28.004 --> 01:14:32.967
But then I realized that I didn't
have to worry because I was dying.

01:14:33.092 --> 01:14:36.721
It's all over. And
for what, you know?

01:14:36.804 --> 01:14:39.640
My last... My last
conscious thought...

01:14:39.724 --> 01:14:43.144
was "I can't believe it. I'm dying.

01:14:43.227 --> 01:14:48.649
On this shitty piece of ground, I'm dying...
and I can't fuckin' believe it."

01:14:48.775 --> 01:14:52.945
Bobby was a surfer, he was a wrestler,
he was a long-distance runner.

01:14:53.029 --> 01:14:55.823
We danced. He was active.
Active, active.

01:14:55.907 --> 01:14:58.117
Our whole life was active.

01:14:58.201 --> 01:15:00.369
And now they're telling
me that he's paralyzed.

01:15:00.495 --> 01:15:03.414
He couldn't believe it and I
couldn't believe it. Right now...

01:15:03.498 --> 01:15:07.418
Bobby's not a boyfriend. He's not
a husband. He's not a brother.

01:15:07.502 --> 01:15:10.505
It-It's very...

01:15:12.632 --> 01:15:14.592
It's very hard.

01:15:14.675 --> 01:15:16.928
What hurts the most...

01:15:17.011 --> 01:15:19.222
and this is a purely
personal thing, you know?

01:15:19.347 --> 01:15:22.975
Right, wrong or indifferent,
that's how I feel.

01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:25.103
When I was in the Marine Corps,

01:15:25.186 --> 01:15:28.106
I remember I was in the Marine
Corps barracks in Washington...

01:15:28.189 --> 01:15:30.191
They call it "A," "F," and "I."

01:15:30.274 --> 01:15:33.111
And they had the Marine
Corps drill team there.

01:15:33.194 --> 01:15:37.281
And I was standing at
attention in my uniform...

01:15:37.365 --> 01:15:39.283
and they were playing the
"Marine Corps Hymn".

01:15:39.367 --> 01:15:42.620
And then they played the
'star-Spangled Banner."

01:15:42.703 --> 01:15:44.914
And I actually started to cry.

01:15:46.374 --> 01:15:51.045
I cried because I was so proud
to be an American, you know?

01:15:51.170 --> 01:15:53.965
And I was so proud
to be a marine...

01:15:54.048 --> 01:15:57.051
and in uniform, standing
there at attention.

01:15:59.053 --> 01:16:02.890
That-That represented
so much to me...

01:16:02.974 --> 01:16:06.477
in the way of life and...

01:16:06.561 --> 01:16:09.063
That's gone, you know?

01:16:09.188 --> 01:16:12.483
And that hurt. That hurts.

01:16:12.567 --> 01:16:14.569
That's what I'm bitter about.

01:17:08.456 --> 01:17:12.543
Ha! Didn't think we were here,
did you, you dirty rotten rats!

01:17:12.627 --> 01:17:14.754
We're still here!
We'll always be here!

01:17:35.316 --> 01:17:39.153
Truman lied from 1950 on...

01:17:39.237 --> 01:17:42.156
on the nature and purposes
of the French involvement,

01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:48.079
the colonial reconquest of Vietnam...
that we were financing and encouraging.

01:17:48.162 --> 01:17:50.581
Eisenhower lied
about the reasons for...

01:17:50.665 --> 01:17:53.084
and the nature
of our involvement with Diem,

01:17:53.167 --> 01:17:55.837
and the fact that he was in power,
essentially,

01:17:55.962 --> 01:18:00.258
because of American support,
American money, and for no other reason.

01:18:00.341 --> 01:18:05.680
Kennedy lied about the type of
involvement we were doing there,

01:18:05.763 --> 01:18:07.682
our own combat involvement,

01:18:07.765 --> 01:18:11.269
and about the recommendations that were
made to him for greater involvement.

01:18:11.352 --> 01:18:13.271
President Kennedy lied about...

01:18:13.354 --> 01:18:16.482
the degree of our participation
in the overthrow of Diem.

01:18:17.859 --> 01:18:22.113
The, um... Johnson, of course,
lied and lied and lied...

01:18:22.196 --> 01:18:24.740
about our provocations
against the North Vietnamese...

01:18:24.866 --> 01:18:27.618
prior to and after
the Tonkin Gulf incidents,

01:18:27.702 --> 01:18:31.289
about the plans
for bombing North Vietnam,

01:18:31.372 --> 01:18:35.626
and the nature of the buildup...

01:18:35.710 --> 01:18:38.129
of American troops in Vietnam.

01:18:38.212 --> 01:18:42.633
Nixon, as we now know, misled and
lied to the American public...

01:18:42.717 --> 01:18:46.179
for the first months of his office in
terms of our bombing of Cambodia...

01:18:46.262 --> 01:18:48.681
and of Laos,
ground operations in Laos,

01:18:50.016 --> 01:18:53.478
the reasons for our invasion
of Cambodia and of Laos,

01:18:53.561 --> 01:18:57.982
and the prospects for the mining at
Haiphong that came about in 1972,

01:18:58.065 --> 01:19:00.693
but was envisioned
as early as 1969.

01:19:01.986 --> 01:19:05.573
The American public
was lied to month by month...

01:19:05.698 --> 01:19:08.576
by each of these
five administrations.

01:19:08.701 --> 01:19:12.330
As I say, it's a tribute
to the American public,

01:19:12.413 --> 01:19:16.834
that their leaders perceived
that they had to be lied to.

01:19:16.918 --> 01:19:21.255
It's no tribute to us that it
was so easy to fool the public.

01:19:21.380 --> 01:19:23.841
We have adopted a plan...

01:19:23.925 --> 01:19:27.386
which we have worked out in cooperation
with the South Vietnamese...

01:19:27.512 --> 01:19:32.350
for the complete withdrawal of
all U.S. combat ground forces...

01:19:32.433 --> 01:19:35.853
and their replacement
by South Vietnamese forces...

01:19:35.937 --> 01:19:38.856
on an orderly, scheduled timetable.

01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:42.693
This withdrawal will be made from
strength and not from weakness.

01:19:42.777 --> 01:19:45.363
As South Vietnamese forces
become stronger,

01:19:45.446 --> 01:19:49.450
the rate of American withdrawal
can become greater.

01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:55.957
Congratulations to Battalion 332...

01:19:56.082 --> 01:19:59.710
on your recent victories
over the communists.

01:19:59.794 --> 01:20:03.714
We ask ourselves,
"When will peace come?"

01:20:03.798 --> 01:20:07.385
And I tell you, if you chase
the communists back to the north,

01:20:07.468 --> 01:20:10.471
there won't be any war
in this hamlet.

01:20:10.555 --> 01:20:13.891
Help rebuild the houses.

01:20:13.975 --> 01:20:16.102
Help the people.

01:20:17.812 --> 01:20:20.565
Rid the hamlet of all V. C...

01:20:20.648 --> 01:20:23.276
so there will be no more suffering
and destruction...

01:20:23.401 --> 01:20:26.863
for ourselves and our compatriots.

01:20:31.492 --> 01:20:34.245
Oh, my friend.

01:20:34.328 --> 01:20:36.414
- How you doing? Good to see you again.
- You just get back?

01:20:36.497 --> 01:20:39.584
- Yeah. How you doing, men?
- Very good to see you.

01:20:39.667 --> 01:20:41.919
How you doing?
Trung, good seeing you.

01:20:42.003 --> 01:20:45.423
- Good to see you, sir.
- How you doing? Fine.

01:20:45.506 --> 01:20:48.426
Just came in this afternoon, sir.
Been very quiet?

01:20:48.509 --> 01:20:51.929
- Except last time, when the, uh...
- When the rockets went off?

01:20:52.013 --> 01:20:53.931
Yeah.

01:20:54.015 --> 01:20:57.018
Very nice. I read about
it in Stars And Stripes.

01:20:57.143 --> 01:20:59.604
That's one of our success stories
here, this battalion is.

01:20:59.687 --> 01:21:01.773
We had a real, uh...
a lot of trouble with it.

01:21:01.856 --> 01:21:04.275
We just gave, uh,
four bronze stars...

01:21:04.358 --> 01:21:07.445
and five Ar-Comms
with V-device this week...

01:21:07.528 --> 01:21:11.282
to a battalion commander and three
of his officers and five soldiers.

01:21:11.365 --> 01:21:14.786
And we have six N-pac awards...

01:21:14.869 --> 01:21:17.455
pending for
last Saturday night's action...

01:21:17.538 --> 01:21:20.374
where we killed six V.C.
And captured nine weapons.

01:21:20.458 --> 01:21:21.417
Good grief.

01:21:21.542 --> 01:21:26.798
He had been the recon company
commander of the, uh, 263rd...

01:21:26.881 --> 01:21:31.636
and he'd done a real tremendous job
just as recon company commander.

01:21:31.719 --> 01:21:34.806
And then they moved him over here.

01:21:34.889 --> 01:21:37.489
In a ten-day period or two-week
period, he completely reversed it.

01:21:37.558 --> 01:21:42.522
They had the battalion here
under a very poor major.

01:21:42.647 --> 01:21:46.150
They had it to the point
where the company commanders...

01:21:46.234 --> 01:21:49.487
were throwing down their weapons
and crying... or at least one of them did.

01:21:49.570 --> 01:21:52.490
Ten days later they had
a big contact with the V. C...

01:21:52.573 --> 01:21:57.703
and in 3 days killed 42,
lost none of their own.

01:21:57.787 --> 01:22:00.373
He does it with a
fairly limited staff.

01:22:00.498 --> 01:22:03.835
Although some of his people, like
that young major there, Major Yuk...

01:22:03.918 --> 01:22:05.837
tremendous guy.

01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:09.465
He just heard his name over there.
Hey.

01:22:28.901 --> 01:22:31.446
It's no surprise
that in a very poor country...

01:22:31.571 --> 01:22:35.783
you can find people
who will wear foreign uniforms.

01:22:35.908 --> 01:22:37.785
What has always surprised us,

01:22:37.910 --> 01:22:41.789
what we've never been willing
to predict or understand,

01:22:41.914 --> 01:22:44.792
is that the Vietnamese
communist leadership...

01:22:44.917 --> 01:22:48.045
can find enough people
to live in the tunnels,

01:22:48.129 --> 01:22:51.048
fight for nothing
wearing ragged shorts,

01:22:51.132 --> 01:22:53.634
year after year
under the American bombs.

01:22:53.759 --> 01:22:58.055
A war in which one side
is entirely financed...

01:22:58.139 --> 01:23:03.144
and equipped and supported by foreigners...
is not a civil war.

01:23:03.269 --> 01:23:05.146
The only foreigners
in that country...

01:23:05.271 --> 01:23:07.899
were the foreigners we financed
in the first part of the war...

01:23:07.982 --> 01:23:12.904
and the foreigners we were
in the second half of the war.

01:23:12.987 --> 01:23:17.408
Basically, we didn't want to acknowledge...
the scale of our involvement there.

01:23:17.492 --> 01:23:19.410
We didn't want to realize
that it was our war,

01:23:19.494 --> 01:23:23.748
because that would have been to say
that every casualty on both sides...

01:23:23.831 --> 01:23:26.334
was a casualty
caused by our policy.

01:23:26.459 --> 01:23:30.338
The question used to be "Might it
be possible we were on the wrong side...

01:23:30.421 --> 01:23:32.715
in the Vietnamese War?"

01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:35.259
We weren't on the wrong side.

01:23:35.343 --> 01:23:38.054
We are the wrong side.

01:23:44.102 --> 01:23:47.271
You have exemplified,
in your corner of the world,

01:23:47.355 --> 01:23:49.524
patriotism of the highest order.

01:23:49.649 --> 01:23:54.654
You have brought to your great task
of organizing your country...

01:23:54.737 --> 01:23:58.199
the greatest of courage,
the greatest of statesmanship.

01:24:09.335 --> 01:24:11.295
I had two possibilities.

01:24:11.379 --> 01:24:14.632
Either I could submit
to Washington's politics...

01:24:14.715 --> 01:24:17.885
Every morning, "Yes, sir."

01:24:18.010 --> 01:24:20.513
Or I would have to resign.

01:24:23.266 --> 01:24:27.061
You can be sure that as a soldier
I only submit very rarely.

01:24:30.356 --> 01:24:32.316
And, in fact, never.

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:35.236
I chose the second solution,
that of resigning.

01:24:35.319 --> 01:24:40.158
On the Vietnamese side, I would say
the most encouraging factor...

01:24:40.241 --> 01:24:43.035
is the promise offered
by General Khanh's government.

01:24:46.914 --> 01:24:51.335
Through a security
service in the president's office,

01:24:51.419 --> 01:24:54.839
we taped all communications
with the outside.

01:24:54.922 --> 01:24:58.342
All telephone communications.

01:24:58.426 --> 01:25:02.346
And fortunately, among these
taped telephone communications,

01:25:02.430 --> 01:25:05.850
I still have the tape
from which we can hear precisely...

01:25:05.933 --> 01:25:07.977
General Taylor...

01:25:10.521 --> 01:25:14.484
stating precisely that he wants me,
General Khanh,

01:25:16.944 --> 01:25:19.363
to leave Vietnam.

01:25:19.447 --> 01:25:22.575
Can you let us hear it?

01:25:25.119 --> 01:25:27.455
Certainly. I hope it works.

01:25:30.792 --> 01:25:34.045
- General Taylor.
- Uh, this is General Khanh speaking.

01:25:34.128 --> 01:25:36.047
How are you? Glad to hear you.

01:25:36.130 --> 01:25:39.550
Uh, uh, may I speak in French?

01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:10.414
Mr. President and ladies and gentlemen,
as our joint communique indicates,

01:26:10.498 --> 01:26:13.751
President Thieu and I have
had very constructive talks...

01:26:13.835 --> 01:26:18.089
with regard to how we shall
work together in the years ahead,

01:26:18.172 --> 01:26:22.426
working for the program of peace,

01:26:22.510 --> 01:26:27.473
which we now hope
will all be the wave of the future,

01:26:27.598 --> 01:26:30.768
not only for the
Republic of Vietnam,

01:26:30.852 --> 01:26:33.771
but for all of the countries
in Indochina.

01:26:54.208 --> 01:26:57.086
What kind of freedom
could you preserve here...

01:26:57.211 --> 01:27:01.966
when you put so many
of our compatriots into prison...

01:27:02.049 --> 01:27:05.887
without any charge,
without any reason why?

01:27:07.722 --> 01:27:11.976
Just because you want us
to have freedom?

01:27:12.059 --> 01:27:15.646
What kind of freedom
could you give us?

01:27:15.730 --> 01:27:19.650
We know that we only have freedom
if we fight for it.

01:27:19.734 --> 01:27:23.571
But here we fight for what?

01:27:23.654 --> 01:27:25.573
We fight for prisons?

01:27:30.578 --> 01:27:34.707
People can be arrested
at any moment by any organization.

01:27:37.335 --> 01:27:41.297
And then tortured in inhuman ways
in all the prisons.

01:27:42.548 --> 01:27:44.926
And, above all, in police stations.

01:27:49.180 --> 01:27:52.725
And then imprisoned
for years and years without trial.

01:27:53.851 --> 01:27:55.895
Their only crime
is loving their country.

01:27:58.272 --> 01:28:01.526
They had the courage
to tell the truth.

01:28:01.609 --> 01:28:04.862
They asked for the liberation
of political prisoners.

01:28:07.281 --> 01:28:09.617
They asked for an end to the war.

01:28:11.119 --> 01:28:15.206
They asked for peace,
for national reconciliation.

01:28:15.289 --> 01:28:19.752
And all that is considered a crime
by the government of Thieu.

01:28:26.050 --> 01:28:28.803
I was arrested in 1968.

01:28:28.928 --> 01:28:31.931
I was at home
when the security police came.

01:28:33.307 --> 01:28:36.310
They took me to headquarters
for a few questions...

01:28:36.436 --> 01:28:38.438
and kept me.

01:28:44.068 --> 01:28:47.738
You can't imagine
how badly I was beaten.

01:28:47.822 --> 01:28:51.492
Mostly on the head.
My eyes are bad now.

01:28:51.617 --> 01:28:55.079
After I was arrested,
I was beaten so badly...

01:28:55.163 --> 01:28:57.290
even now
I sometimes have headaches...

01:28:57.373 --> 01:28:59.667
and nosebleeds and ear-bleeds.

01:29:03.504 --> 01:29:07.175
In those days, all we were
getting to eat was rotten fish,

01:29:07.300 --> 01:29:09.594
so we asked for some vegetables.

01:29:09.677 --> 01:29:12.513
But when we complained,
we were beaten and chained...

01:29:12.597 --> 01:29:14.766
and lime powder was thrown on us.

01:29:14.849 --> 01:29:18.311
And they poured water on us,
and we had nowhere to run.

01:29:23.816 --> 01:29:26.110
Our cells were this big...

01:29:26.194 --> 01:29:28.946
and we could do nothing
but stand where we were...

01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:31.783
and get the water
and the lime all over us.

01:29:31.866 --> 01:29:34.786
Some of us lost our teeth
and our hair.

01:29:34.869 --> 01:29:39.290
And when the lime got wet, it just
boiled up, bubbling all over us.

01:29:39.373 --> 01:29:44.337
Our hair fell out and our skin
became covered with sores.

01:29:47.715 --> 01:29:50.301
They said that if we were innocent,

01:29:50.384 --> 01:29:53.304
they would beat us
until we were guilty,

01:29:53.387 --> 01:29:58.142
and that if we were guilty, they
would beat us until we repent.

01:30:04.148 --> 01:30:09.987
In a country where the people
don't hold national sovereignty,

01:30:10.071 --> 01:30:13.533
in a country where
the government has proven itself...

01:30:13.616 --> 01:30:18.204
to be the enemy of the people,
the prisoners are the patriots.

01:30:20.289 --> 01:30:26.754
And no matter how badly treated
we are, still we are proud,

01:30:26.838 --> 01:30:28.756
because at least we are free,

01:30:28.881 --> 01:30:34.095
instead of enslaved as so many of
the so-called government officials.

01:30:38.516 --> 01:30:40.435
And so, you see,

01:30:40.518 --> 01:30:43.438
when a Vietnamese works
for peace and for liberty,

01:30:45.064 --> 01:30:47.442
he is considered a communist.

01:30:51.946 --> 01:30:56.284
It is an honor for the communists to
have to work for peace and justice.

01:30:58.911 --> 01:31:02.707
So it is the government which gives
validity to being a communist,

01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:04.709
because they continue to say...

01:31:04.792 --> 01:31:08.754
that the people who work for justice
and for peace are communists.

01:31:10.631 --> 01:31:12.508
You see?

01:31:12.633 --> 01:31:14.760
We were learning to
be good soldiers...

01:31:14.844 --> 01:31:16.804
back when you're three, four,
five, six years old.

01:31:16.888 --> 01:31:21.225
That's when good ol' mom is telling you
to obey the local camp regulations.

01:31:21.309 --> 01:31:23.644
In this case, it's the house.

01:31:23.728 --> 01:31:27.064
And you start to learn
to respect authority.

01:31:27.148 --> 01:31:30.067
And so, finally, lo and behold,
at 20, 22 years old,

01:31:30.151 --> 01:31:34.238
you find yourself in service and
maybe take that last and final step,

01:31:34.322 --> 01:31:39.410
where you become quite regimented...
in a military form of discipline.

01:31:39.494 --> 01:31:43.915
That stuff isn't worth the paper it's
written on, if the basis isn't there.

01:31:43.998 --> 01:31:47.460
You need that cornerstone that goes back
to childhood, and who's teaching you,

01:31:47.543 --> 01:31:52.048
but good old moms,
women like yourselves.

01:31:52.173 --> 01:31:55.426
It's terrifying. When you're facing a
torture session with a bunch of gooks,

01:31:55.510 --> 01:31:57.428
it's gonna be pretty
darn miserable.

01:31:57.512 --> 01:31:59.793
No doubt about it. You're scared.
You're really petrified.

01:31:59.847 --> 01:32:02.767
But at the other side, you have
a bunch of women back there...

01:32:02.850 --> 01:32:05.436
telling you, "You better
do something," you know?

01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:08.773
That's the wrath of God. You don't want
100 women climbing down your back,

01:32:08.856 --> 01:32:11.484
So you figure the
gooks aren't so bad.

01:32:11.567 --> 01:32:13.528
So you press on.

01:32:13.611 --> 01:32:16.280
In many respects,
the destiny of our country,

01:32:16.364 --> 01:32:19.617
and more personally,
the destiny of me,

01:32:19.700 --> 01:32:24.455
your men, your children...
is in your hands.

01:32:24.539 --> 01:32:27.959
If you are proud of the P.O. W. S
and personally of me,

01:32:28.042 --> 01:32:33.381
then you should be proud of yourselves,
because I was what you made me to be.

01:32:33.506 --> 01:32:37.885
As for my own view, uh, I thought
through as best I could...

01:32:37.969 --> 01:32:40.972
the meaning of Southeast Asia
to the United States in the 1950s,

01:32:41.055 --> 01:32:43.307
Looking backward
and looking forward...

01:32:43.391 --> 01:32:46.978
in terms of what I know about the
dynamics of societies and so on.

01:32:47.061 --> 01:32:50.022
And on balance...
It is an on-balance judgment...

01:32:50.106 --> 01:32:52.984
I came to the judgment that it's a
vital interest to the United States.

01:32:53.067 --> 01:32:55.570
I've never had any reason
to change that judgment.

01:32:57.238 --> 01:33:01.617
And, uh, therefore, I, uh,

01:33:01.742 --> 01:33:06.080
I do believe that what we have done
is generally right,

01:33:06.164 --> 01:33:09.792
although I would have preferred
to have seen a different,

01:33:09.917 --> 01:33:11.919
more decisive military strategy.

01:33:12.044 --> 01:33:14.338
Certainly, to me,

01:33:14.422 --> 01:33:19.093
the day you can say that a sacrifice
such as that is not worthwhile...

01:33:19.218 --> 01:33:21.846
is the day that you've destroyed
all your real values...

01:33:21.929 --> 01:33:24.432
of what is worthwhile
and what isn't.

01:33:24.557 --> 01:33:26.434
And there's no
question in my mind...

01:33:26.559 --> 01:33:30.021
that he and everybody else
that did what he did...

01:33:30.104 --> 01:33:32.857
there's no sacrifice
that is in vain.

01:33:32.940 --> 01:33:37.862
Absolutely none. Down the line, that's
the price you pay for freedom...

01:33:37.945 --> 01:33:43.034
and that's the price that you pay for
the kind of stature that we have...

01:33:43.117 --> 01:33:47.789
and it's the kind of risk you take...
to preserve the ideals that we have.

01:33:47.872 --> 01:33:49.791
He had just a tremendous
sense of humor...

01:33:49.874 --> 01:33:55.546
and just an amazing, instinctive sense
of what was important and what wasn't.

01:33:55.630 --> 01:33:58.716
I remember when I was getting ready
for our oldest daughter's wedding,

01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:01.886
and I was upset because something
or other wasn't going well,

01:34:01.969 --> 01:34:05.306
and he called up from Pensacola and
he said, "How are thing's going?"

01:34:05.389 --> 01:34:07.934
And I said, "Fine, Bing,
but such-and-such has happened."

01:34:08.059 --> 01:34:10.978
He said, "Oh, Mom,
don't sweat the small stuff."

01:34:11.062 --> 01:34:13.231
You know,
it just made all the difference.

01:34:13.314 --> 01:34:16.067
I thought, "Gee. That really
is small stuff, you know?"

01:34:16.150 --> 01:34:18.236
And it was. Yeah.

01:34:18.319 --> 01:34:20.863
And it made the whole thing
much easier.

01:34:20.988 --> 01:34:25.576
And, of course, I came up in a tradition
where military service was...

01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:28.913
In World War II, there was no
question everybody was part of it.

01:34:28.996 --> 01:34:31.499
There was not the kind
of dissension and so forth...

01:34:31.624 --> 01:34:36.129
that there has been surrounding
the Vietnam thing.

01:34:36.212 --> 01:34:38.756
But I think that most of the
people of this country...

01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:41.592
are too busy
to get involved deeply...

01:34:41.676 --> 01:34:43.594
in, uh, uh,

01:34:43.678 --> 01:34:47.598
on, uh, the kind of things
that the dissenters do.

01:34:47.682 --> 01:34:50.685
In other words, I think that really
the strength of our system,

01:34:50.768 --> 01:34:52.854
and I think it's a terrific system,

01:34:52.979 --> 01:34:57.358
is that you do rely on somebody like
President Nixon for leadership.

01:34:57.483 --> 01:35:02.613
I think his team of people with him
are outstanding...

01:35:02.697 --> 01:35:05.783
and, to me,
the leadership that he has shown...

01:35:05.867 --> 01:35:08.286
and decisions that he has made,

01:35:08.369 --> 01:35:13.291
uh, really have...
They're the kind of decisions...

01:35:13.374 --> 01:35:15.793
I would expect from
the president of this country.

01:35:15.877 --> 01:35:19.380
And the action he has taken
is the action I'd expect...

01:35:19.505 --> 01:35:21.799
from the president of this country.

01:35:21.883 --> 01:35:25.970
I think the whole executive,

01:35:26.053 --> 01:35:31.976
legislative and judicial system
that we have is superb.

01:35:32.059 --> 01:35:36.814
It has worked many, many... far better
than any other system I'm aware of...

01:35:36.898 --> 01:35:40.485
and brought us
to our state of power...

01:35:40.568 --> 01:35:45.656
and, uh, really,
of international stature...

01:35:45.740 --> 01:35:51.579
that we have a responsibility
to stay with and to uphold.

01:35:54.665 --> 01:35:57.001
What did your son want to become?

01:35:57.084 --> 01:35:59.921
I suspect he would have
gone into the newspaper.

01:36:00.004 --> 01:36:03.174
He actually had just got a job
with the New York Times...

01:36:03.257 --> 01:36:08.387
when he went into the, uh, O.C.S.

01:36:09.597 --> 01:36:14.018
And he'd worked for newspapers
in the summer...

01:36:14.102 --> 01:36:16.979
while he was at college.

01:36:20.108 --> 01:36:22.693
I suppose that it's like any pain.

01:36:22.777 --> 01:36:26.739
You don't remember pain too well...
afterwards.

01:36:44.757 --> 01:36:48.636
Thank you. Thank you very much,
Mr. President, dear people.

01:36:48.761 --> 01:36:52.390
I'm thrilled to be here with you guys.
This is what I like... a captive audience.

01:36:59.856 --> 01:37:02.400
It is always the custom
at a dinner at the White House...

01:37:02.483 --> 01:37:05.820
to have a toast
to the honored guest.

01:37:05.945 --> 01:37:08.823
The difficulty tonight is that there
are so many honored guests...

01:37:08.948 --> 01:37:11.576
that we would be drinking
all night and into the day.

01:37:19.333 --> 01:37:22.378
Somebody just said,
"What's wrong with that?"

01:37:24.046 --> 01:37:26.966
The most difficult decision that I
have made since being president...

01:37:27.049 --> 01:37:30.261
was on December the
18th of last year.

01:37:30.344 --> 01:37:32.346
There...

01:37:39.937 --> 01:37:41.814
And there were many occasions...

01:37:41.898 --> 01:37:44.734
in the 10-day period
after the decision was made...

01:37:44.859 --> 01:37:47.779
when I wondered whether
this country really supported it.

01:37:50.156 --> 01:37:54.952
After having met each one of our
honored guests this evening...

01:37:55.036 --> 01:38:00.458
and after having talked to them,
I think that all of us...

01:38:00.541 --> 01:38:02.794
would like to join
in a round of applause...

01:38:02.877 --> 01:38:07.131
for the brave men that took
those B-52s in and did the job.

01:39:34.969 --> 01:39:37.430
My eight-year-old
daughter was killed.

01:39:38.973 --> 01:39:41.559
And my three-year-old son.

01:39:41.642 --> 01:39:44.645
A son, three years old, killed.

01:39:46.981 --> 01:39:49.484
Nixon, murderer of civilians.

01:39:51.319 --> 01:39:55.406
What have I done to Nixon so that
he comes here to bomb my country?

01:39:57.033 --> 01:39:59.911
My daughter died right here.

01:39:59.994 --> 01:40:02.497
She was feeding the pigs.

01:40:02.580 --> 01:40:04.499
She was so sweet.

01:40:06.167 --> 01:40:09.587
She is dead. The pigs are alive.

01:40:11.339 --> 01:40:14.926
My mother and my children
took shelter here.

01:40:15.009 --> 01:40:17.011
Here they died.

01:40:21.516 --> 01:40:23.601
The planes came from over there.

01:40:23.684 --> 01:40:25.603
No targets here.

01:40:25.686 --> 01:40:28.022
Only rice fields and houses.

01:40:29.524 --> 01:40:32.777
I'll give you
my daughter's beautiful shirt.

01:40:34.529 --> 01:40:37.031
Take it back to the United States.

01:40:38.533 --> 01:40:40.660
Tell them what happened here.

01:40:40.785 --> 01:40:43.037
My daughter is dead.

01:40:44.372 --> 01:40:46.707
She will never wear
the shirt again.

01:40:52.004 --> 01:40:54.382
Throw the shirt in Nixon's face.

01:40:56.050 --> 01:41:00.388
Tell them she was only
a little schoolgirl.

01:43:22.655 --> 01:43:25.700
Well, the Oriental...

01:43:25.825 --> 01:43:29.495
doesn't put the same high price
on life as does a Westerner.

01:43:31.038 --> 01:43:34.041
Life is plentiful,
life is cheap in the Orient.

01:43:35.668 --> 01:43:38.671
And, uh, as the, uh,

01:43:40.840 --> 01:43:44.218
philosophy of the, uh,
of the Orient, uh,

01:43:45.887 --> 01:43:47.889
uh, expresses it, uh,

01:43:49.557 --> 01:43:53.519
uh, life is, uh,

01:43:54.896 --> 01:43:57.273
is not important.

01:44:07.575 --> 01:44:09.911
During the missions,
after the missions,

01:44:09.994 --> 01:44:12.079
the result of what I was doing...

01:44:12.205 --> 01:44:16.834
the result of this-this game,

01:44:16.918 --> 01:44:21.339
this, uh, exercise
of my technical expertise...

01:44:21.422 --> 01:44:23.508
never really dawned on me.

01:44:23.591 --> 01:44:29.180
That reality of the screams
or the people being blown away...

01:44:29.263 --> 01:44:31.265
or their homeland being destroyed,

01:44:33.267 --> 01:44:37.772
uh, just was not a part
of what I thought about.

01:45:03.506 --> 01:45:06.217
Uh, we, as Americans,
have never experienced that.

01:45:06.300 --> 01:45:10.638
We've never experienced
any kind of devastation.

01:45:14.934 --> 01:45:18.813
When I was there, I never saw
a child that got burned by napalm.

01:45:22.024 --> 01:45:25.236
I didn't drop napalm, but I
dropped other things just as bad.

01:45:25.319 --> 01:45:29.407
I dropped C.B.U. s, which
can't destroy anything.

01:45:29.490 --> 01:45:31.993
It's meant for people.
It's an antipersonnel weapon.

01:45:32.076 --> 01:45:34.745
We used to drop canister upon
canister of these things...

01:45:34.829 --> 01:45:38.916
with 200 tumbling little balls in
there about this big around...

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.252
with something like
600 pellets in each ball...

01:45:41.335 --> 01:45:43.921
that would blow out
as soon as it hit the ground,

01:45:44.005 --> 01:45:46.257
uh, and shred people to pieces.

01:45:46.340 --> 01:45:48.593
They couldn't be gotten out
in many cases.

01:45:48.676 --> 01:45:52.263
People would suffer. They would live,
but they would suffer, you know?

01:45:52.346 --> 01:45:54.265
Then often they would
die afterwards.

01:45:54.348 --> 01:45:57.935
This would cause people to have
to take care of them, you know?

01:45:58.019 --> 01:46:00.354
But I look at my children now...

01:46:01.856 --> 01:46:06.944
and, uh, I don't know what
would happen if, uh...

01:46:07.028 --> 01:46:10.990
uh, what I would think about
if someone napalmed them.

01:46:43.314 --> 01:46:46.025
Do you think we've learned
anything from all this?

01:46:47.527 --> 01:46:49.695
I think we're trying not to.

01:46:50.947 --> 01:46:53.324
I think I'm trying
not to sometimes.

01:46:53.407 --> 01:46:55.409
I can't even cry easily.

01:46:56.410 --> 01:47:00.331
From my, uh, my manhood image.

01:47:01.707 --> 01:47:04.877
I think Americans have tried...

01:47:05.002 --> 01:47:08.005
We've all tried very hard...

01:47:08.089 --> 01:47:10.007
to escape
what we've learned in Vietnam,

01:47:10.091 --> 01:47:14.345
to not come to the logical conclusions
of what's happened there.

01:47:14.429 --> 01:47:17.181
You know, the military
does the same thing.

01:47:17.265 --> 01:47:19.392
They don't realize that, um,

01:47:21.102 --> 01:47:23.438
people fighting for
their own freedom...

01:47:25.940 --> 01:47:29.861
uh, are not gonna be stopped...

01:47:29.944 --> 01:47:32.029
by just changing your tactics,

01:47:32.113 --> 01:47:35.032
adding a little bit more
sophisticated technology over here,

01:47:35.116 --> 01:47:39.704
improving the tactics we used last time,
not making quite the same mistakes.

01:47:39.787 --> 01:47:43.374
Uh, you know, I think history operates
a little different than that.

01:47:43.458 --> 01:47:48.045
And I think that those kind of
forces are not gonna be stopped.

01:47:48.129 --> 01:47:51.716
I think Americans have
worked extremely hard...

01:47:52.967 --> 01:47:57.221
not to see, uh, the criminality,

01:47:57.305 --> 01:48:01.225
uh, that their officials
and their policy makers,

01:48:01.309 --> 01:48:04.771
uh, have exhibited.

01:49:42.910 --> 01:49:45.538
Number one! Number one!

01:50:42.637 --> 01:50:44.806
It's your country, not a toilet,
you bastards!

01:50:44.931 --> 01:50:48.684
They oughta go to Cuba. That's
where they belong. Or Russia.

01:50:53.856 --> 01:50:57.941
Boo!

01:50:58.111 --> 01:51:00.154
You motherfuckers!

01:51:05.993 --> 01:51:08.913
Man, let me talk to somebody.
I was in Vietnam.

01:51:08.996 --> 01:51:10.915
I was a platoon leader over there.

01:51:10.998 --> 01:51:13.334
What is this?
What the hell is this?

01:51:13.417 --> 01:51:15.795
We were the ones that got shot.

01:51:15.878 --> 01:51:19.173
You guys were over there too
with your damn cameras.

01:51:22.677 --> 01:51:25.263
Holy... Make my day!

01:51:40.194 --> 01:51:42.196
Come on, smile a little bit!

01:51:42.321 --> 01:51:44.282
Come on! Smile! Smile!

01:51:44.365 --> 01:51:47.869
Be happy! Smile!
Everything isn't bad!
