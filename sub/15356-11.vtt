WEBVTT

00:54.555 --> 00:56.635
Why are you here?

00:56.725 --> 00:59.435
I... got a call to come here.

00:59.455 --> 01:01.575
Are you related to the deceased?

01:01.595 --> 01:03.185
Yes.

01:05.065 --> 01:07.255
M... Mom.

01:10.075 --> 01:12.865
All right, you may enter this way.

01:13.125 --> 01:14.645
Yes.

03:07.955 --> 03:09.375
How long have you known?

03:09.395 --> 03:11.948
Since the time I almost fell
at the broadcasting station...

03:12.349 --> 03:13.847
when I saw your eyes.

03:13.975 --> 03:16.565
And you pretended not to know?

03:16.585 --> 03:18.905
I couldn’t bring myself to tell you.

03:18.965 --> 03:23.095
If you knew,
you would have tried to avoid me even more.

03:24.105 --> 03:28.175
I’m warning you,
don’t get involved in my business anymore.

03:28.305 --> 03:29.845
How can I do that?

03:29.885 --> 03:33.915
The person I shot
is the same one who saved my life twice.

03:34.835 --> 03:36.785
How many lives do you have?

03:36.825 --> 03:40.765
I warned you.
Don’t get involved in my business anymore.

03:40.815 --> 03:43.185
This is my true face.

03:43.595 --> 03:47.925
Snuffing out a life like yours,
is nothing to someone like me.

03:48.415 --> 03:53.765
If you don’t want to die, erase everything
you know about me from your mind.

03:54.815 --> 03:59.915
Go back to the time before you knew me
or even met me.

04:18.355 --> 04:19.725
You said it's not a match?

04:19.745 --> 04:23.155
Yes, the blood you brought
from the crime scene,

04:23.215 --> 04:26.235
and the blood you brought today,
aren’t a match.

04:26.275 --> 04:29.705
How can...?
Are you sure you ran the test properly?

04:29.725 --> 04:31.975
Are you questioning me right now?

04:31.995 --> 04:34.319
I set aside all my work to do this for you
first because you’re a pretty prosecutor.

04:34.320 --> 04:36.431
I’m so sad.

04:56.645 --> 04:59.455
You ended up doing the blood test.

04:59.475 --> 05:00.343
And Prosecutor Kim

05:00.344 --> 05:02.852
was lying in wait to take your blood sample
to the National Forensic Service.

05:02.855 --> 05:06.995
Nothing happened. I switched it
at the National Forensic Service.

05:07.035 --> 05:10.135
That prosecutor suspects you now.

05:10.165 --> 05:13.305
Do you think that by making that one switch,
he'll stop suspecting you?

05:13.355 --> 05:15.985
I’ll be careful not to get caught.

05:16.005 --> 05:18.075
A person who is being careful...

05:18.095 --> 05:19.472
Would he leave his perfectly good home

05:19.473 --> 05:22.564
to go and live with a girl named Kim Na Na
at her house?

05:22.645 --> 05:25.835
What if your identity is exposed?

05:25.855 --> 05:27.935
It hasn't been exposed.

05:28.175 --> 05:31.335
If she ever discovers who you are...

05:32.415 --> 05:35.136
that child will have to die.

05:41.515 --> 05:45.095
We’re here to take revenge.

05:45.565 --> 05:49.115
Don’t be swayed by your personal feelings.

06:29.955 --> 06:32.355
It must have hurt so much...

06:45.015 --> 06:46.775
<i>How many lives do you have?</i>

06:47.095 --> 06:51.435
I warned you,
don’t get involved in my business anymore.

06:58.035 --> 06:59.915
Lee Yoon Sung,

07:01.335 --> 07:04.035
erase Kim Na Na...

07:05.770 --> 07:07.936
for Na Na.

07:30.825 --> 07:33.375
It’s Go Ki Joon and Lee Yoon Sung.

07:35.625 --> 07:37.375
Oh, hey.

07:45.115 --> 07:46.429
Dr. Lee Yoon Sung,

07:46.518 --> 07:50.017
you didn’t go to the Integrated Government
meeting last night? Huh?

07:50.105 --> 07:52.025
When it was our team's turn to present,

07:52.045 --> 07:55.175
the executives got impatient and left
because our presenter didn't show up.

07:55.195 --> 07:57.405
And the whole meeting became a mess.

07:57.425 --> 08:01.385
On my way to Gwacheon,
I went the wrong way and got a little lost.

08:01.405 --> 08:03.295
I'll call the executives right away.

08:03.315 --> 08:05.265
Dr. Lee, you’ve never been to the
Integrated Government Building before?

08:05.285 --> 08:08.885
What do you mean?
He’s been there twice with me.

08:09.315 --> 08:10.557
MIT isn't so impressive after all.

08:10.558 --> 08:12.738
How can you get lost
when you've been there twice...?

08:14.065 --> 08:16.465
Did you go somewhere else by any chance?

08:18.755 --> 08:20.555
It can happen.

08:20.575 --> 08:22.212
He just came from America not long ago,

08:22.213 --> 08:24.310
so he might still be unfamiliar
with the roads in Seoul.

08:24.325 --> 08:27.775
He always gets lost in the Blue House.
Right, Lee Yoon Sung?

08:27.795 --> 08:29.315
It’s my fault.

08:29.335 --> 08:32.525
I'll take responsibility and explain
to the affected departments.

08:32.544 --> 08:37.495
I'll redo yesterday's presentation and
make sure there are no mistakes this time.

08:42.485 --> 08:44.625
He's not going to get lost anymore.

08:49.535 --> 08:51.885
<i>Kim Na Na, come to the bench.</i>

09:01.715 --> 09:04.695
Did you think my warning last time
was a joke?

09:06.575 --> 09:11.245
I was just worried you’d be in a tight spot
because of what happened yesterday.

09:11.265 --> 09:13.685
I told you not to get involved.

09:14.135 --> 09:16.735
I’ve lived my life solely for my objective.

09:16.775 --> 09:19.875
If you become an obstacle,
I won’t forgive you.

09:19.905 --> 09:21.516
I’m not scared at all.

09:21.850 --> 09:25.308
Even if you threaten me like this,
I'm not scared.

09:25.405 --> 09:29.175
The fact that I know your secret
doesn't change anything.

09:29.195 --> 09:33.305
You're still the same Lee Yoon Sung I know.

09:33.325 --> 09:35.417
Don't be mistaken.

09:35.452 --> 09:39.260
Do you think there's any truth to the
Lee Yoon Sung you've seen up until now?

09:39.265 --> 09:44.145
That... is something
you'd know better than me.

09:45.235 --> 09:47.615
You saved me.

09:48.175 --> 09:53.055
With an injured arm and an injured shoulder,
you saved me.

09:53.075 --> 09:55.605
Even if it had been Shin Eun Ah,
I would have saved her.

09:56.155 --> 10:00.275
To me, you're just a prop I used
to cover my identity.

10:00.315 --> 10:03.635
To me, your usefulness has expired.

10:03.675 --> 10:06.615
Pack your things up tonight
and get out of the house.

10:06.655 --> 10:11.895
You, your house...
I don’t need them anymore.

10:14.495 --> 10:17.575
You said even if it had been Shin Eun Ah,
you would have saved her...

10:19.095 --> 10:23.015
That means you didn’t kill
Lee Kyung Wan, right?

10:24.855 --> 10:28.645
I can believe that at least, right?

10:30.335 --> 10:34.884
The eyes of the man named Lee Yoon Sung
I know,

10:35.195 --> 10:37.156
I can trust that too, right?

10:37.175 --> 10:39.995
Don’t make me regret saving your life.

10:52.545 --> 10:53.875
[Letter of Resignation]

10:54.885 --> 10:58.395
Wh... what is this, Dr. Lee?

10:58.415 --> 10:59.245
It’s my resignation letter.

10:59.305 --> 11:03.515
No... I mean why are you resigning?

11:03.535 --> 11:05.395
Is it because of what I said before?

11:05.425 --> 11:07.768
I only asked because I was worried,

11:07.769 --> 11:11.204
like maybe you got into an accident
or something.

11:11.305 --> 11:12.255
That's not the reason.

11:12.275 --> 11:14.325
Then what is it?

11:14.375 --> 11:17.585
The work isn’t interesting,
so I want to change jobs.

11:17.625 --> 11:18.975
Luckily, an opportunity has come up.

11:18.995 --> 11:21.715
Dr. Lee, you can’t do this.

11:21.735 --> 11:24.885
You’re the cornerstone
of our Communications Network Team!

11:24.935 --> 11:28.035
Here, I’ll pretend I never got this,
so take it back.

11:28.055 --> 11:30.675
Please take it.
I’m quitting.

11:30.695 --> 11:33.345
Dr. Lee, what company is it?

11:33.355 --> 11:35.045
What company are you trying to go to?

11:35.105 --> 11:37.585
If you insist on going there,

11:37.605 --> 11:38.752
I’ll go to the higher-ups

11:38.753 --> 11:41.246
and have them run a detailed investigation
on the company, okay?

11:41.275 --> 11:45.425
Either way, I've told you,
so please take care of it quickly.

11:47.015 --> 11:47.845
Ay, wait, wait, wait...

11:47.865 --> 11:50.155
Dr. Lee... Dr. Lee!

11:51.915 --> 11:54.615
Was I too harsh before?

11:57.265 --> 11:59.175
It’s not me.

12:02.685 --> 12:03.905
I’m sorry.

12:03.935 --> 12:05.674
I was following Lee Yoon Sung,

12:05.675 --> 12:09.655
but Kim Na Na suddenly ran
in front of the car, asking for you.

12:09.690 --> 12:10.595
Na Na did?

12:10.615 --> 12:11.835
Yeah.

12:11.855 --> 12:14.765
If it wasn’t for Na Na,
I wouldn’t have lost him.

12:14.785 --> 12:15.705
By the way,

12:15.775 --> 12:17.975
I looked into it...

12:18.005 --> 12:21.835
The reason Lee Yoon Sung got a blood test
was for a woman named Lee Kyung Hee.

12:21.875 --> 12:26.805
Her husband went missing in October 1983.

12:26.825 --> 12:30.675
And her husband was in a special ops team.

12:30.805 --> 12:36.165
October 1983,
a special ops soldier who went missing...

12:45.305 --> 12:47.145
Lee Kyung Hee?

12:49.785 --> 12:52.635
I’m Prosecutor Kim from the Seoul District
Prosecutor's Office, Special Investigations.

12:53.145 --> 12:58.895
I’m sorry, but your husband Park Moo Yul
went missing in October 1983, right?

13:00.855 --> 13:01.925
Yes.

13:01.945 --> 13:04.485
I'd like to know
a few things about your husband.

13:04.486 --> 13:06.127
Can we talk for a moment?

13:06.295 --> 13:08.375
I’d like to know, too.

13:09.015 --> 13:11.355
Twenty-eight years ago,

13:11.375 --> 13:14.455
the place he went to
saying he'd be back shortly,

13:14.475 --> 13:16.835
why he went there,
why he never returned...

13:16.855 --> 13:19.185
I don’t know anything about that.

13:19.215 --> 13:20.905
But why are you curious about it?

13:20.925 --> 13:24.055
It’s related to the case
that I’m working on.

13:24.075 --> 13:29.895
Like your husband, it has to do with the
people who went missing in October 1983.

13:30.155 --> 13:34.115
When your husband went missing,
what was your husband’s job?

13:34.135 --> 13:36.815
He was a security agent for the Blue House.

13:36.835 --> 13:41.295
He was protecting the president
when that big incident occurred at Aung San.

13:43.035 --> 13:44.996
Right after he came back, he disappeared.

13:45.015 --> 13:48.035
You’re saying that your husband was a
security agent assigned to the president,

13:48.055 --> 13:50.675
during his tour at Aung San?

14:00.005 --> 14:01.855
I’m sorry.

14:02.365 --> 14:06.925
I don’t want to think about
the events of twenty-eight years ago.

14:06.945 --> 14:09.945
I’m tired, so please excuse me.

14:25.065 --> 14:26.975
Jin Pyo.

14:30.245 --> 14:33.635
The prosecutor managed to find you too.

14:38.085 --> 14:41.425
What happened twenty-eight years ago?

14:41.645 --> 14:44.425
What was Moo Yul doing when he died?

14:44.445 --> 14:49.695
And why you took my child...
I need to know the truth.

14:50.275 --> 14:53.125
Moo Yul died for his country.

14:53.165 --> 14:57.365
And he was betrayed by his country.

14:58.775 --> 15:01.605
I’ll make it so that those prosecutors
don’t come looking for you again.

15:01.645 --> 15:07.305
The person the prosecutors are looking for,
it isn’t you, is it?

15:18.415 --> 15:23.595
Jin Pyo... I might die.

15:25.035 --> 15:26.835
Before I die, just once...

15:28.340 --> 15:31.136
let me see my child’s face.

15:32.955 --> 15:35.865
Please let me see him just once.

15:38.955 --> 15:41.135
I’m sorry, Kyung Hee.

15:41.355 --> 15:43.685
Your son is dead.

15:45.015 --> 15:46.255
What?

15:46.275 --> 15:50.475
He died... in an airplane crash
five years ago.

15:52.275 --> 15:54.135
You said he was alive!

15:54.155 --> 15:56.186
You said he was living well in America!

15:56.187 --> 15:57.852
I lied to you!

16:00.075 --> 16:04.955
The people who killed Moo Yul
caused your son's death, too.

16:06.905 --> 16:10.925
H... How do you expect me to believe
anything you say?

16:11.875 --> 16:16.985
Last time you said he was living well,
and now you’re saying that he’s dead?

16:17.015 --> 16:19.115
Liar!

16:26.835 --> 16:28.595
[Korean Boy Killed in Airplane Accident]

16:28.615 --> 16:31.905
The small aircraft accident was reported
in a Korean-American newspaper.

16:32.235 --> 16:34.806
But do you think it was really an accident?

16:39.605 --> 16:41.795
That's the kind of people they are.

16:41.815 --> 16:46.225
To achieve their goals,
they treat human lives like they're flies.

16:48.755 --> 16:52.645
You can’t even begin to imagine
how Moo Yul died.

16:55.755 --> 16:57.685
Kyung Hee,

16:57.855 --> 17:00.185
just forget everything that happened.

17:00.205 --> 17:04.345
Get your illness treated,
and live your life.

17:04.365 --> 17:06.655
I’ll help you.

17:07.145 --> 17:09.375
This can’t be happening.

17:10.335 --> 17:13.974
I only lived for the day I'd see my child.

17:14.005 --> 17:17.895
This can’t happen, this can’t happen.

17:18.194 --> 17:20.375
I’m at war with those people now.

17:20.895 --> 17:25.905
If they find out I came here to see you,
you could be in danger.

17:26.085 --> 17:30.875
I found a safe hospital somewhere else,
so let’s go there.

17:34.865 --> 17:38.115
Stay focused!
That’s the only way you’ll live!

17:45.485 --> 17:48.835
Kyung Hee, I...

17:50.320 --> 17:52.936
want you to live well.

18:18.915 --> 18:24.075
No, no... This isn’t right.
It can't be.

18:30.735 --> 18:34.895
Help her pack and watch over her
when she moves to the other hospital.

18:36.695 --> 18:37.915
Why aren’t you answering?

18:37.955 --> 18:40.655
Did you have to go that far?

18:40.715 --> 18:43.475
Telling her that Yoon Sung died,
even though he’s alive and well?

18:43.885 --> 18:49.135
Yoon Sung and I have lived harshly
for our revenge up until now.

18:49.395 --> 18:53.375
We can't let petty things
like personal feelings get in the way.

18:54.275 --> 18:57.035
If Kyung Hee appears in his life,

18:58.035 --> 19:00.336
Yoon Sung will get distracted.

19:09.955 --> 19:11.815
Eat some more!

19:12.095 --> 19:13.845
I don’t have an appetite.

19:15.045 --> 19:19.135
You've lost more weight, eat something.

19:21.305 --> 19:24.345
Aigoo, why can't we have
even one peaceful day?

19:25.475 --> 19:29.205
By the way... Yoon Sung,
can you take a look at this for me?

19:29.225 --> 19:31.415
I wrote a confession letter.

19:31.435 --> 19:32.635
Confession?

19:32.655 --> 19:33.955
Yeah.

19:34.005 --> 19:36.075
The work we do is so dangerous.

19:36.105 --> 19:38.068
If by any chance something happens to me,

19:38.099 --> 19:40.687
poor Na Na will have to bear this injustice
for the rest of her life.

19:40.705 --> 19:43.515
I have to at least send a confession
to put my heart at ease.

19:43.535 --> 19:47.365
Grammar mistakes won't make it
less effective legally, right?

19:47.875 --> 19:49.855
I told Na Na to take her luggage
and move out.

19:49.875 --> 19:51.195
What?

19:51.245 --> 19:53.345
She has nowhere else to go,
how could you tell her to move out?

19:53.365 --> 19:57.385
That's the only way to make her leave me
and convince Father, too.

19:58.845 --> 20:01.115
I’m going to go to the hospital.

20:03.025 --> 20:06.705
Yoon Sung at least eat something
before you go. Yoon Sung!

20:08.715 --> 20:11.865
Did you need something?

20:12.485 --> 20:16.875
I feel very frustrated,
so I wanted to have a Sprite.

20:16.895 --> 20:19.015
Stay here.
I’ll get it for you.

20:19.065 --> 20:21.435
No, I can go.

20:21.465 --> 20:24.655
No...
Stay here.

21:43.785 --> 21:47.145
The patient who was staying here,
Lee Kyung Hee, where did she go?

21:47.175 --> 21:51.605
After a man with a cane came by,
she disappeared.

21:51.625 --> 21:55.885
We’re looking for her right now too,
but I don’t think she’s in the hospital.

22:04.605 --> 22:06.875
What happened?

22:09.145 --> 22:10.175
What do you mean?

22:10.195 --> 22:12.075
What did you do to her?

22:12.095 --> 22:16.915
You went ahead and did what I told you not
to do. But it seems you're scared after all.

22:16.965 --> 22:17.965
Please answer me.

22:17.985 --> 22:21.095
Prosecutor Kim
has started to suspect your identity.

22:21.135 --> 22:24.345
He even found out about the relationship
between your mom and Moo Yul.

22:24.395 --> 22:27.199
If he takes your blood sample
for a DNA test,

22:27.200 --> 22:29.102
your identity will be exposed right away.

22:29.105 --> 22:33.305
Then, in order to find you,
do you think

22:33.640 --> 22:36.306
the Council of Five
will leave your mom alone?

22:36.345 --> 22:39.555
Where is she?

22:40.265 --> 22:42.705
I moved her somewhere safe.

22:44.975 --> 22:48.895
Of course, as long as you don't defy me,

22:49.325 --> 22:51.396
she'll remain safe.

22:52.575 --> 22:56.435

I’ll leave it to you.

23:17.895 --> 23:21.635
I searched the entire hospital,
but she’s not here.

23:27.165 --> 23:28.875
Okay.

23:35.215 --> 23:38.825
Your mom has arrived safely
at the hospital I arranged for her.

23:38.855 --> 23:40.505
Where is that?

23:40.525 --> 23:42.625
I’ll go there.

23:43.165 --> 23:48.815
There's only about one month's time left
to save your mother.

23:49.305 --> 23:55.005
In her current condition, if she doesn’t
get treatment or a bone marrow transplant,

23:55.225 --> 23:59.635
then you know full well
there's no chance she'll survive.

24:02.335 --> 24:07.775
Your method of exacting revenge,
I will acknowledge it.

24:07.795 --> 24:12.355
But you must acknowledge
that my method is also a form of revenge.

24:13.405 --> 24:18.695
If my leg wasn’t like this,
I would have personally taken revenge.

24:18.715 --> 24:21.135
I won't force you.

24:22.545 --> 24:28.535
But... if you go against me,
you will lose two things.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.536
The mother you hate,
but whose life you still want to save,

24:33.555 --> 24:38.115
and the woman
you willingly risked your own life to save...

24:38.135 --> 24:39.875
Father.

24:42.465 --> 24:45.995
This repetitive battle with you
is getting tedious.

24:47.376 --> 24:48.896
The choice is yours.

24:48.915 --> 24:51.585
They have nothing to do with this.

24:51.615 --> 24:53.705
Don’t touch them.

24:54.695 --> 24:59.385
If you do it my way...
then I will do as you ask.

25:12.685 --> 25:15.235
Find Kyung Hee immediately.

because of school tuition...

25:42.175 --> 25:45.365
It's a wise decision
for young people to not have children..

25:45.385 --> 25:47.404
My oldest child was worried
about me working too hard,

25:47.405 --> 25:48.793
so she just gave up on going to college.

25:48.835 --> 25:50.916
<i>No matter how expensive they say tuition is,</i>

25:50.917 --> 25:53.765

I just arrived.

26:16.675 --> 26:18.265
Have you heard about Seo Yong Hak?

26:18.285 --> 26:20.915
I heard he was delivered straight to my son.

26:21.085 --> 26:23.505
I don't know about
Lee Kyung Wan and Seo Yong Hak,

26:23.535 --> 26:27.645
but I won’t be taken down so easily.
I've committed no unlawful acts.

26:27.665 --> 26:29.875
Are you that confident?

26:31.365 --> 26:36.105
If you can’t find it even if you look, then
it’s not an unlawful act. That is the law.

26:36.385 --> 26:39.825
After I meet with Young Joo, I'll tell you
what I find out about the investigation.

26:39.855 --> 26:41.925
The president wants to see us.

26:42.545 --> 26:44.245
Let’s talk at the Blue House when we meet.

26:44.265 --> 26:45.915
Fine.

26:53.305 --> 26:55.635
Yeah, it’s Dad.

27:00.175 --> 27:02.425
Is work going well?

27:03.385 --> 27:06.625
You’re probably busy
with the City Hunter or whatever.

27:06.645 --> 27:11.075
You called me as soon as you arrived.
What’s going on?

27:11.295 --> 27:13.885
You don’t have any interest in what I do.

27:14.165 --> 27:20.135
Sometimes... I miss the days
when we went fishing together.

27:20.345 --> 27:21.895
Those were good times...

27:24.135 --> 27:27.396
I don’t know
when this friction between us started.

27:28.145 --> 27:29.826
At one time,

27:29.927 --> 27:35.282
I was like you and wanted to stand
on the side of justice and virtue, but...

27:36.155 --> 27:38.370
Without even realizing it,
I rose to the highest ranks...

27:41.045 --> 27:43.156
After I had taste of power,

27:44.957 --> 27:47.957
maybe I just didn't want to let it go.

27:49.665 --> 27:53.415
How about now?
Do you regret it?

27:54.185 --> 27:55.985
No.

27:57.255 --> 28:00.395
The taste is too sweet to regret.

28:01.015 --> 28:06.952
However,
I want you to live a life that befits you.

28:07.537 --> 28:09.583
Take your own path.

28:11.745 --> 28:14.125
Because you’re another me...

28:16.415 --> 28:20.255
No.
I’m not like you.

28:20.275 --> 28:22.905
We’re different, down to the bones.

28:23.955 --> 28:26.125
I’m leaving first.

28:33.055 --> 28:38.877

29:00.065 --> 29:05.075
Is this it? The files that my son
wants you to make public?

29:05.525 --> 29:08.525
It was a closed ceremony,
but he came to see me.

29:08.545 --> 29:10.665
He said his investigations
have come to a standstill,

29:10.685 --> 29:15.445
but if he were to obtain these files,
he would make progress.

29:15.785 --> 29:18.095
Does he suspect something?

29:18.115 --> 29:20.475
About Operation Clean Sweep in 1983?

29:20.495 --> 29:24.095
No, I don’t think he suspects.
However...

29:24.115 --> 29:26.645
If he sees this he will catch on.

29:27.805 --> 29:33.685
After what happened to Lee Kyung Wan,
the mountain no longer seems small.

29:34.055 --> 29:37.625
The fact that you didn't burn the files
and called us here,

29:37.865 --> 29:42.645
suggests that you have a desire
to make this public.

29:44.355 --> 29:47.825
I think we should reveal it,
don't you think?

29:47.885 --> 29:49.855
For whom?

29:49.925 --> 29:52.875
Are you going to say it's for the nation
and the citizens again?

29:52.905 --> 29:56.345
Would you still say that after you're
removed from office and sent to prison?

29:56.375 --> 29:59.435
- Chairman Chun...
- I’m against it.

30:00.185 --> 30:04.125
Let this be taken to the grave...
It's what we must do.

30:04.165 --> 30:06.375
That's how I feel as well.

30:07.055 --> 30:11.445
At the very least,
I don't want my son to find out about this.

30:13.375 --> 30:16.515
Whoever commits a wrong, even if it's us,

30:17.955 --> 30:20.616
deserves to be punished by the citizens.

such an honest president, then go ahead.

I know the weak point

30:29.640 --> 30:32.850

Regardless, I've told you clearly,
so please process it quickly.

It’s not like that.
I’m sorry, Chief.

31:24.735 --> 31:27.075
Chief, I really didn’t lay a hand on him.

31:27.115 --> 31:32.145

I bought him meat with my brother, too.

31:32.835 --> 31:34.715
Oh, that shopping bag...

31:34.735 --> 31:38.145

because you broke up, right?

Do you want it?

31:43.435 --> 31:44.955
Can I?

31:44.975 --> 31:46.885
This looks very expensive.

31:46.905 --> 31:49.125
I don’t have a girl to give it to anyway.

31:49.515 --> 31:51.615
Then I’m leaving.

31:51.895 --> 31:53.115

32:27.595 --> 32:30.825
Either way, it’s pretty,
so I’ll let it go.

Lee Yoon Sung quit the Blue House?

32:35.715 --> 32:36.615
What?

32:36.635 --> 32:39.605
I heard Lee Yoon Sung originally bought this
for his girlfriend.

32:39.655 --> 32:42.045
But he said he was going to throw it away
so Go Ki Joon took it.

32:42.075 --> 32:44.425
He just packed up his stuff
and is leaving right now.

32:44.445 --> 32:46.205
Isn’t Lee Yoon Sung funny?

32:46.225 --> 32:49.585
We helped each other out
with Judo training,

32:49.605 --> 32:52.115
but he just leaves
without even saying goodbye.

33:13.935 --> 33:17.855
Is this job a joke to you,
that you can quit so easily?

33:18.055 --> 33:21.375
I wanted to work here so badly
that I even applied three times.

33:21.395 --> 33:24.345
You don’t have to quit because of me.

33:26.125 --> 33:28.005
I'll forget.

33:28.035 --> 33:31.205
I’ll go back to the time before I met you,
Lee Yoon Sung.

33:33.385 --> 33:37.885
I’ll disappear from your life.

33:40.005 --> 33:42.185

Oh, that...

It’s a quote that our prosecutor recites
when he’s going through a rough time.

37:02.365 --> 37:04.788
Long Leg Ahjussi is Prosecutor Kim,

37:04.789 --> 37:08.536
and you’re going to reinvestigate
my parent's accident.

37:08.575 --> 37:10.765
This kind of fate is rare.

37:10.785 --> 37:13.165
Are you looking into that reinvestigation?

37:13.185 --> 37:15.305
Yes. Oh, right.

37:15.345 --> 37:18.155
Bae Man Deok sent me this.

37:18.175 --> 37:19.278
After the accident,

37:19.279 --> 37:22.047
I couldn’t find him because his
resident registration had been eliminated.

37:22.115 --> 37:24.514
But he sent a full description
of what happened.

37:24.549 --> 37:27.241
He was bribed by someone
named Kim Jong Shik to give false testimony.

37:27.242 --> 37:31.683
He also sent copies of his bank statement.
It's all very detailed.

37:34.575 --> 37:39.675
I'm going to undo this injustice
and clear my parents' names.

37:43.915 --> 37:48.975
Kim Na Na...
I have something to say.

37:52.675 --> 37:55.730
This is going to be really hard because
the statute of limitations has passed,

37:55.731 --> 37:57.568
but I’ll try my best.

37:57.605 --> 38:01.005
I’m going to try my best
to get a reinvestigation, too.

38:01.055 --> 38:05.865
Punishing someone like Kim Jong Shik
is within the power of the law, right?

38:08.735 --> 38:10.835
Thank you.

38:10.945 --> 38:13.645
I’m thankful that you’re Long Leg Ahjussi.

38:13.685 --> 38:16.555
And I’m thankful that you’re helping my dad.

38:17.265 --> 38:20.905

[Myung Mun University Accounting Book]
Myung Mun University's 2 billion won fund...

38:34.805 --> 38:37.135
Where did it all go?

38:40.225 --> 38:41.725
What?
Is something wrong?

38:41.745 --> 38:44.035
There's 2 billion won missing
from the university fund.

38:44.055 --> 38:47.693
I went through all of Kim Jong Shik's
accounts, but there are barely any deposits.

38:47.694 --> 38:49.247
And I didn't find any hidden accounts.

38:49.305 --> 38:53.905
You know Kim Jong Shik, he treats
the Foundation's money like it's his own.

38:53.925 --> 38:56.455
I had a drink with his household gardener.

38:56.475 --> 38:58.935
He said he gets paid by the university
and is listed as an university employee.

38:58.965 --> 39:00.435
He doesn’t pay him with his own money?

39:00.465 --> 39:01.855
No.

39:02.535 --> 39:04.485
Rotten man...

39:04.785 --> 39:07.845
The students are eating triangle kimbab
for a meal to save money for tuition,

39:07.875 --> 39:10.055
but he uses the money like that?

39:10.675 --> 39:13.165
Yoon Sung, eat this.

No matter how much I made her worry,
she always put up with me.

39:30.725 --> 39:33.145
So your mom was like that.

39:36.825 --> 39:37.665
It’s good.

- Yeah.

39:54.925 --> 39:57.812
What... what if I get caught?

39:57.813 --> 40:00.506
I’m really going to die this time, Yoon Sung.

40:00.515 --> 40:04.775
If we track Father's whereabouts,
I'll be able to find her.

40:04.815 --> 40:06.295
We can't just sit around and do nothing.

40:06.335 --> 40:09.095
Yeah, that’s true, but...

40:10.096 --> 40:12.396
I’m really scared, Yoon Sung.

40:12.635 --> 40:16.815
Father's guard is down around you,
so you’ll be fine.

40:16.855 --> 40:20.405
That’s true, but...

40:20.855 --> 40:24.415
If I get caught like last time, I’m really
going to go be sent to the underworld.

41:06.965 --> 41:09.795
I might not be able to protect it,

No, no. The sofa is fine.
I can sleep well on the sofa.

By the way, did you know
my Long Leg Ahjussi is Prosecutor Kim?

41:58.395 --> 42:00.855
You said you've been friends with him
for ten years.

42:00.915 --> 42:04.175
Huh?
I didn’t know.

42:04.195 --> 42:06.125

42:06.545 --> 42:11.215
Anyway, Prosecutor Kim said he’d help with
the reinvestigation of my parent's accident.

were both sent to me by the City Hunter.

so shameful that they've enraged citizens.

45:49.545 --> 45:52.161
You knew the witness
was on probation for gambling,

45:52.162 --> 45:54.372
so you used that to blackmail him.

56:38.185 --> 56:41.595
Kim Na Na, run as fast as you can.

57:34.295 --> 57:39.005
50,000 won bills are 15.4 cm x 6.8 cm,
the thickness is about 1.2.

57:39.035 --> 57:41.905
That's approximately 16 cm x 7 cm.

57:42.065 --> 57:45.030
3.2 m long and 1.4 m wide.

57:45.031 --> 57:48.321
There are 20 rows and 20 columns.

57:48.325 --> 57:50.895
So that's about 20 million won per layer.

57:51.415 --> 57:56.366
It’s about 1.2 m high, so...

57:56.367 --> 57:57.879
The total is 200 billion...

57:58.912 --> 58:01.596
It’s all here!

58:24.865 --> 58:28.845
Na Na. Let’s go to the car.
Yoon Sung told us to go to the car and wait.

58:28.865 --> 58:30.835
He's been in there a while...

58:30.885 --> 58:33.175
- I’m going inside.
- Hey!

58:33.195 --> 58:35.525
Do you know how upset Yoon Sung gets
when you stick your neck out?

58:35.575 --> 58:37.645
Why are your guts so big
compared to your body?

58:37.675 --> 58:40.475
But what kind of a relationship
do you have with Yoon Sung?

58:40.495 --> 58:42.915
- I’ll tell you if you go to the car.
- We got him!

58:46.645 --> 58:48.105
Yoon Sung!

58:56.605 --> 58:58.655
That jerk, what did he do to our Yoon Sung?

58:58.685 --> 59:00.325
Where did you say the car was?

59:00.355 --> 59:01.165
Over there.

59:01.205 --> 59:02.595
Let’s go.

59:25.985 --> 59:27.575
Who are you?

59:27.595 --> 59:30.415
What were you doing
charging into someone else’s house?

59:31.045 --> 59:35.155
You guys know why I came.

59:37.955 --> 59:41.535
Yeah.
Talk back all you want.

59:41.555 --> 59:44.685
Your life is about to end anyway.

59:45.475 --> 59:49.485
I don’t know why you’re targeting
Chairman Kim Jong Shik, but...

59:52.995 --> 59:55.115
It's not going to work.

59:55.285 --> 59:56.825
Why?

59:57.085 --> 59:58.735
Because you’re going to die today.

59:58.775 --> 01:00:00.335
Let go...

01:00:00.385 --> 01:00:01.905
What?

01:00:02.505 --> 01:00:08.135
I said let go.
I care a lot about my hairstyle.

01:00:08.645 --> 01:00:10.685
You Bastard...

01:00:10.705 --> 01:00:12.435
Hold it!

01:00:18.975 --> 01:00:21.435
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

01:00:21.965 --> 01:00:23.855
Untie him.

01:00:33.025 --> 01:00:35.845
Come, hit me.

01:00:38.135 --> 01:00:40.455
Whoa, whoa!

01:00:43.475 --> 01:00:45.125
I'm over here, You Idiot.

01:00:45.165 --> 01:00:46.510
Ah, seriously...

01:00:47.328 --> 01:00:48.530
Let go!

01:00:50.265 --> 01:00:53.555
I think they drugged Yoon Sung.

01:00:53.585 --> 01:00:56.475
I’m going to call...
It’s in the car.

01:00:56.495 --> 01:01:02.465
I’m going to go call either the boss or the
police, so stay here and keep watch. Okay?

01:01:09.625 --> 01:01:11.635
Come on.

01:01:13.965 --> 01:01:16.135
Hey, get up, get up.

01:01:19.085 --> 01:01:22.365
I said hit me straight, Jerk!

01:02:27.299 --> 01:02:28.238
Kim Na Na?

01:02:28.239 --> 01:02:29.239
Seriously...

01:02:37.725 --> 01:02:39.895
You bastard!

01:03:51.125 --> 01:03:52.885
Kim Na Na...

01:03:55.515 --> 01:03:57.335
Kim Na Na...

01:03:57.725 --> 01:03:59.305
Why?

01:04:00.525 --> 01:04:02.385
Why?

01:04:03.955 --> 01:04:09.904
You saved me... twice.

01:04:13.935 --> 01:04:19.655
Did you... hurt this much, too?

01:04:20.275 --> 01:04:24.645
Don’t talk.
Don't say a word.

01:04:26.375 --> 01:04:31.855
Did you... hate me?

01:04:35.115 --> 01:04:39.895
I'd like it if you say you didn't.

01:04:46.275 --> 01:04:51.345
I wanted... to say thank you.

01:04:52.095 --> 01:04:54.815
Why did you run in and get shot?

01:04:54.835 --> 01:04:57.885
Why did you run in and get shot?!

01:04:58.585 --> 01:05:03.745
Thank goodness it wasn't you.

01:05:09.895 --> 01:05:11.135
Kim Na Na...

01:05:11.185 --> 01:05:14.585
Kim Na Na. Kim Na Na.

01:05:17.755 --> 01:05:19.855
Kim Na Na!

01:05:20.535 --> 01:05:22.315
Kim Na Na...
