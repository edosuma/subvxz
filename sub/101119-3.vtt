WEBVTT

00:05.423 --> 00:07.174
Y'all better sit
y'all asses down.

00:07.216 --> 00:09.135
It's time for "P-Valley."

00:09.176 --> 00:12.471
They say if we don't pay up in
30 days, they gonna have our
asses kissing asphalt.

00:12.513 --> 00:15.516
Y'all gonna be practicing
inside this new building right
here.

00:15.558 --> 00:18.227
The new home
of the Chucalissa Challengers.

00:19.645 --> 00:25.192
I thought you was gonna get
another one of your daughter's
contributions today.

00:25.234 --> 00:28.237
I'ma need those 20 stacks I let
y'all hold come end of the week.

00:28.279 --> 00:29.655
Just talk to your daughter.

00:29.697 --> 00:34.243
I think I might just have to try
you out on that pulpit one
Sunday service.

00:34.285 --> 00:36.287
Corbin just text.
Say he ain't coming.

00:36.328 --> 00:39.165
The brother from another mother
strikes again. Ain't this some
shit?

00:39.206 --> 00:41.751
Promised Land can't start until
we have the signatory of all
owners.

00:41.792 --> 00:44.587
But I ain't interested in making
a little one-off $1 million.

00:44.628 --> 00:46.839
I'm interested in
making $10 million,

00:46.881 --> 00:49.425
and if we actually lease
our land to the casino,

00:49.467 --> 00:51.719
that's what we could make
over the long haul.

00:51.761 --> 00:53.012
New song, huh?

00:53.053 --> 00:54.597
You need to holler
at DJ Neva Scared.

00:54.638 --> 00:56.515
He get more bump
in his bathroom.

00:56.557 --> 00:58.100
There's a casino
coming to Chucalissa?

00:58.142 --> 01:00.060
Ask him yourself.

01:00.102 --> 01:02.104
"Andre Watkins, Esquire."

01:02.146 --> 01:03.397
I don't need to talk to him.

01:03.439 --> 01:05.483
Not when I got somebody else
it seem he like talking to.

01:05.524 --> 01:07.276
You are not my pimp.

01:07.318 --> 01:10.571
Oh, but I am your employer
with a fake-ass ID in my hand.

01:10.613 --> 01:11.614
Now, unless you don't want me
to call the sheriff,

01:11.655 --> 01:13.783
let him know about the little
fraud game you probably running,

01:13.824 --> 01:15.743
I suggest you do as I say.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.822
Is there room for me
on that lap of yours?

01:53.447 --> 01:56.408
You know I can always
make room for the GOAT.

01:57.201 --> 01:59.495
You should have been
moved to Atlanta,

01:59.537 --> 02:02.414
with all that talent.

02:03.374 --> 02:05.835
I'm fine where I is, Coach,

02:05.876 --> 02:07.378
right here with you.

02:09.046 --> 02:12.216
Besides, how else
we would've had met?

02:13.968 --> 02:17.179
Chucalissa don't deserve you.

02:18.681 --> 02:22.852
How about I take you on up to
Memphis with me?

02:22.893 --> 02:26.438
I'll put you up in that condo,
right on the river.

02:27.147 --> 02:30.234
Have you sit front and center...

02:31.694 --> 02:32.778
...every game.

02:34.238 --> 02:37.658
You's a fool to think you'd be
concentrating on your ball
players...

02:38.909 --> 02:41.078
...with me sitting
on the 50-yard line.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.790
I know you right.

02:44.832 --> 02:46.917
I'ma have to put you
on up in the skybox.

02:46.959 --> 02:48.919
Wouldn't want them
Giuseppes getting messed up

02:48.961 --> 02:51.130
by somebody in the crowd.

02:52.590 --> 02:55.676
Wouldn't want somebody
within earshot of their wife.

02:58.804 --> 03:00.180
Shit.

03:02.391 --> 03:04.184
I'm serious about this.

03:04.226 --> 03:05.686
Let me take care of you.

03:09.481 --> 03:13.861
Coach, baby, this fantasy cheap.

03:13.903 --> 03:18.115
Real life,
I don't think you could afford
her.

05:19.153 --> 05:20.863
I know I'm biased,

05:20.904 --> 05:22.698
but you should try this one on.

05:25.242 --> 05:27.202
Look at you, gecko!

05:27.244 --> 05:29.329
-You mean chameleon?
-What you said?

05:29.371 --> 05:31.707
A stripper always got
to have her looks.

05:31.749 --> 05:33.625
That's what my mama always say.

06:18.087 --> 06:21.465
Hey, Bill, I just finished
looking over the blueprints.

06:21.507 --> 06:23.300
You're gonna love what they did.

06:24.468 --> 06:26.887
Yeah. Yeah, check your inbox.

07:39.751 --> 07:41.170
You done talk to
your regular yet?

07:41.211 --> 07:43.922
How somebody you dance for once
is a regular is beyond me.

07:43.964 --> 07:46.341
Heifer, don't get smart with me.

07:46.383 --> 07:48.719
If you don't talk to that damn
man about this damn casino, you
better.

07:48.760 --> 07:51.972
I called him. Left a message.
He didn't call me back.

07:56.018 --> 07:57.978
I want my tea.

08:01.523 --> 08:02.983
No tea...

08:05.027 --> 08:06.403
...no ID.

08:18.582 --> 08:21.460
God-daddy, now, why
you wastin' good Macallan?

08:25.214 --> 08:28.217
Gots to feed the gods, boy.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.761
Go ahead. 'Cause you don't know
nothing about that.

08:32.304 --> 08:34.139
See, you left Chucalissa
before the old ways

08:34.181 --> 08:36.433
tattooed themselves
on your heart.

08:37.226 --> 08:39.436
Most niggas leave here,
and they never turn back.

08:41.021 --> 08:41.939
But you?

08:41.980 --> 08:43.440
You remembered me.

08:46.735 --> 08:49.404
And you bringing the casino here

08:49.446 --> 08:52.282
shows me you remembering
your peoples.

08:52.324 --> 08:57.955
See how these mu'fuckers
working day and night to put up
my bar?

08:57.996 --> 09:01.917
How's things with them cowboys?
They sign yet?

09:01.959 --> 09:03.794
Wayne and Wyatt on board,

09:03.835 --> 09:07.297
but they happen to have a half
-brother proving to be tricky.

09:07.339 --> 09:10.801
Corbin say he want to lease.
which I can't say is a bad idea.

09:10.842 --> 09:12.052
No, no, no.

09:12.094 --> 09:15.055
Kyle land is supposed
to have a straight sale, now.

09:16.265 --> 09:18.392
You know, 6 million,
like we discussed.

09:18.433 --> 09:21.436
But it's not even waterfront
property like The Pynk,

09:21.478 --> 09:24.439
which is the only land we
actually need to build the
casino.

09:24.481 --> 09:26.858
I promised those Kyle boys
I was gonna hook 'em up,

09:26.900 --> 09:31.488
you know, call it a gift
for them helping me get elected.

09:31.530 --> 09:33.615
That's a gift or a kickback?

09:38.829 --> 09:42.291
I didn't see you objecting

09:42.332 --> 09:44.626
when your Promised Land folks
was giving me

09:44.668 --> 09:47.337
a few hundred thousand to build

09:47.379 --> 09:52.259
the entire damn
Russell Park, huh?

09:52.301 --> 09:53.385
Come on.

09:53.427 --> 09:55.637
You said this was a
good-faith gesture

09:55.679 --> 09:57.639
to show the city council
that Promised Land

09:57.681 --> 09:58.849
was serious about
rebuilding this town.

09:58.890 --> 09:59.850
Yeah.

09:59.891 --> 10:01.601
You didn't say anything
about naming it after yourself.

10:01.643 --> 10:05.897
Who better to name it after
the first black mayor of
Chucalissa?

10:05.939 --> 10:07.566
Think of the optics, though.

10:07.607 --> 10:10.110
Hey, boy. Lower your voice down.

10:16.700 --> 10:18.118
You judging me?

10:23.081 --> 10:26.752
This is just how things work

10:26.793 --> 10:28.420
in the Delta.

10:28.462 --> 10:31.131
Have always worked around here.

10:31.173 --> 10:35.052
Now, these boys are part
of the cotton connect

10:35.093 --> 10:37.054
that runs this state,

10:37.095 --> 10:39.306
and Wayne Kyle

10:39.348 --> 10:41.558
runs the city council.

10:42.225 --> 10:44.770
Guess they don't call it
the Dirty South for nothin'.

10:44.811 --> 10:46.605
Hey, now...

10:46.646 --> 10:49.775
hey, we got the
police discounts...

10:49.816 --> 10:53.111
so we won't have to
have no citywide vote,

10:53.153 --> 10:57.115
because if those bible-thumpers
find out about this casino,

10:57.157 --> 11:00.577
they gonna send it
straight to hell.

11:01.953 --> 11:03.163
Yeah, man.

11:04.414 --> 11:06.750
We got to keep this
thing a secret, Andre.

11:07.584 --> 11:08.710
Come on.

11:09.795 --> 11:10.962
You hear me?

11:14.049 --> 11:15.425
Come on. Come on.

11:17.803 --> 11:20.138
It smells like it's
gonna rain again.

11:23.767 --> 11:25.310
Yeah.

11:25.352 --> 11:29.398
God is about to shake
the mess out of Mississippi.

11:32.609 --> 11:35.320
- Jungle juice and Tang.
- Jungle juice all day.

11:40.409 --> 11:42.994
Boy, I knew your ass
was project as hell, man.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.496
Can I get a cigarette?

11:44.538 --> 11:47.165
What you need is an escort
with a umbrella.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.709
You gonna be square
out in these streets?

11:49.751 --> 11:51.586
No. She good.

11:51.628 --> 11:53.004
Yeah, I see.

12:53.064 --> 12:55.942
- Don't stop on account of me.
- It's a brief recess.

12:55.984 --> 12:58.528
- You sound like a lawyer.
- That's what I do on weekends.

12:58.570 --> 13:00.864
- What do you do on weekends?
- Go to Atlanta.

13:04.034 --> 13:05.368
What's her name?

13:10.957 --> 13:11.875
Britney.

13:14.961 --> 13:16.755
Well, the closest
I've been to Atlanta

13:16.796 --> 13:19.049
is the Freaknik chapter
in "A Man in Full."

13:19.090 --> 13:20.342
Easily top five.

13:20.383 --> 13:21.968
That blonde wig got
you talking crazy.

13:22.010 --> 13:23.887
- It ain't no "Kindred."
- Shut the front door.

13:23.929 --> 13:25.388
What you know about
some "Kindred"?

13:25.430 --> 13:26.681
What you know about
some patter master?

13:30.101 --> 13:32.103
Your slip is showing, Andre.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.897
Well, yours is, too.

13:39.110 --> 13:40.987
Your wife must miss you
being away for so long,

13:41.029 --> 13:42.697
working on this casino thing.

13:42.739 --> 13:44.783
Hey, can you keep
your voice down?

13:44.824 --> 13:46.409
What? I'm not allowed
to talk about it?

13:46.451 --> 13:49.371
- It's complicated.
- What, you think I wouldn't
understand?

13:49.412 --> 13:51.248
No. No, no, no, no.

13:51.289 --> 13:52.916
I actually think you would.

13:56.920 --> 13:59.714
But I'm not at liberty to speak
on confidential matters, so...

13:59.756 --> 14:00.757
Got it.

14:04.553 --> 14:06.930
Y'all sure is a
cute couple there.

14:06.972 --> 14:08.098
Where y'all staying at?

14:08.139 --> 14:09.975
- Oh, we're not a...
- Staying long.

14:10.016 --> 14:12.310
Just passing through.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.271
Done with our
sightseeing for today.

14:14.312 --> 14:16.773
Niggas always wanna
do Highway 61 trail.

14:16.815 --> 14:20.694
But Robert Johnson's shack got
washed away 60-some years ago.

14:20.735 --> 14:21.945
Ain't shit to see.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.991
You want to see some history?
Go to the mounds.

14:26.032 --> 14:27.117
Oh, yeah.

14:27.158 --> 14:29.244
My grandmama used to take me
there when I was little.

14:29.286 --> 14:32.789
Well, she might've took you
there, but did she tell you the
story?

14:33.790 --> 14:37.460
Two Choctaw brothers walking
they people down south

14:37.502 --> 14:39.129
in search of new land.

14:39.170 --> 14:41.881
Well, every night
when they set up camp,

14:41.923 --> 14:43.550
they would plant a
stick in the ground,

14:43.592 --> 14:46.052
and whichever way
it was pointing,

14:46.094 --> 14:49.889
the next morning,
that's the direction they go.

14:49.931 --> 14:52.851
They did that night after night,

14:52.892 --> 14:56.104
over and over for 100 years.

14:56.146 --> 15:00.275
Anytime one of 'em died,
they carried 'em on they back.

15:00.317 --> 15:05.822
Can you imagine dragging death
on your back like that?

15:07.407 --> 15:09.326
One morning, they got up,
and they saw they stick

15:09.367 --> 15:13.079
was pointing straight up,
and that was all she wrote.

15:13.121 --> 15:16.875
They laid down their bones
and made a home there.

15:16.916 --> 15:20.211
Well, actually, here.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.213
Would you like to go
see the mounds?

15:29.012 --> 15:31.765
Can you add three lumberjack
specials to the ticket on that
table?

15:31.806 --> 15:33.642
Oh, and I'll take two coffees.

15:33.683 --> 15:36.770
- What you need the other one
for? - I like to keep both my
hands warm.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.816
Well, I was just leaving.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.027
Excuse me.

15:47.989 --> 15:51.242
I'll make sure the ticket
is paid for you lovely ladies.

15:52.202 --> 15:53.870
Make sure you leave a tip.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.042
The mounds.

16:00.043 --> 16:01.461
I'd like to see 'em.

16:01.503 --> 16:02.837
Cool.

16:02.879 --> 16:03.922
I'll text you.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.256
I'll reply.

16:07.634 --> 16:10.053
Oh, you better
get you a regular!

16:10.095 --> 16:11.763
I gots two.

16:11.805 --> 16:15.350
Corbin and that
freaky-ass anesthesiologist.

16:15.392 --> 16:18.645
One like to get beat,
and the other like to watch me
sleep.

16:18.687 --> 16:20.480
Mercedes got this coach
from up in Memphis.

16:20.522 --> 16:22.482
Always trying to
play Cap'n Save A Ho.

16:22.524 --> 16:23.775
Bitch, you the ho.

16:25.151 --> 16:27.862
I turned my regular
into my boyfriend.

16:27.904 --> 16:30.949
- A boyfriend?
- White-girl magic.

16:32.075 --> 16:33.034
Nasty.

16:33.076 --> 16:35.036
Look, it's innocent.

16:35.078 --> 16:36.496
Say the guilty.

16:40.291 --> 16:41.459
Well...

16:51.511 --> 16:53.138
Enjoy your breakfast, ladies.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.475
We will!

16:59.310 --> 17:01.855
She's bein' a bitch.
She probably anorexic.

17:01.896 --> 17:03.648
This bitch ain't even eatin'.

17:41.519 --> 17:43.354
- Hey, Corbin.
- Clifford.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.489
You done started
keeping secrets from your girl.

17:53.948 --> 17:56.034
Ain't nobody keeping
no secrets from you.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.203
Yet you consortin'
with the enemy in my palace.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.122
Who this Andre Watkins?

18:01.164 --> 18:02.874
I was just showing
him a good time.

18:02.916 --> 18:04.834
By trying to bribe
him with those stacks?

18:06.711 --> 18:09.380
Ears stay more open than legs
at The Pynk, Corbin.

18:10.381 --> 18:13.134
You know how black-folk talk
strike faster than lightning.

18:13.176 --> 18:15.178
Have I told any of
your other secrets?

18:16.596 --> 18:19.390
Hell, I might be the only person
in this town you can trust.

18:22.811 --> 18:25.271
This casino want
to buy our land.

18:26.189 --> 18:29.567
I'm trying to get my brothers to
lease instead of selling it.

18:29.609 --> 18:32.111
These folks came in
offering some serious stacks.

18:32.153 --> 18:34.280
But Wayne and Wyatt done blew
they whole inheritance,

18:34.322 --> 18:36.616
so they ready to
offload every acre,

18:36.658 --> 18:38.910
but I'm trying to convince 'em
to hold on to it.

18:38.952 --> 18:40.620
It's like what you
tell your girls.

18:40.662 --> 18:42.831
Closed legs still get fed.

18:43.623 --> 18:44.541
Nah, the other one.

18:45.208 --> 18:47.335
Oh. Rule 57.

18:47.377 --> 18:49.712
No change in the G-string,

18:49.754 --> 18:51.256
only dollars.

18:51.297 --> 18:53.591
Why make one dollar
when you can make ten...

18:53.633 --> 18:55.176
million.

18:55.218 --> 18:56.511
Shut your mouth.

18:56.553 --> 18:58.513
That's that legacy money.

18:58.555 --> 19:00.431
That's that private
-school money.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.141
Honey, that's that money money.

19:02.183 --> 19:03.685
Hey. So you trying to tell me

19:03.726 --> 19:04.894
that The Pynk gonna be
right across the street

19:04.936 --> 19:07.522
from a motherfucking
casino, huh?

19:07.564 --> 19:08.940
From a motherfucking casino?

19:08.982 --> 19:10.525
It's gonna take
some time to build.

19:10.567 --> 19:12.443
Oh, well, honey,
Oprah wasn't built in a day.

19:13.236 --> 19:14.904
I can wait for this.

19:14.946 --> 19:16.865
I just got to hold
on to one brick.

19:20.243 --> 19:22.453
And I see what patience'll do.

19:23.580 --> 19:25.415
You had to wait
till your daddy's last breath

19:25.456 --> 19:27.750
for you to get recognized.

19:27.792 --> 19:29.460
And look at ya.

19:30.753 --> 19:33.673
The son of the maid
keeping a plantation goin'.

19:36.134 --> 19:39.679
If that ain't some reparations
for your ass, I don't know what
is.

19:42.348 --> 19:44.851
Funny how you kept that secret
all the way since elementary.

19:44.893 --> 19:47.478
That you the bastard son
of good ol' boy Johnny Kyle?

19:48.563 --> 19:49.689
See that?

19:51.441 --> 19:53.234
This tongue stay tied.

20:00.909 --> 20:03.494
I got to get back to
pickin' this cotton.

20:07.415 --> 20:09.000
Hey, Corbin?

20:09.042 --> 20:10.877
Yes, Clifford?

20:10.919 --> 20:12.712
Get you some sunscreen.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.841
We don't want you
getting black now.

20:19.677 --> 20:22.347
And P-U-S-S-Y

20:22.388 --> 20:24.933
V-A-L-L-E-Y.

20:24.974 --> 20:26.434
Pussy Valley, baby.

20:26.476 --> 20:28.144
Oh, get that money!

20:28.186 --> 20:30.063
Child, we gonna get that money!

20:32.065 --> 20:35.276
'Cause my God is an awesome God,

20:35.318 --> 20:40.156
and the very fact that you
have survived is a message.

20:40.198 --> 20:41.616
A promise.

20:41.658 --> 20:42.951
A prophecy.

20:44.327 --> 20:49.082
I stand before you,
an imperfect promised soul.

20:49.123 --> 20:51.334
I done done some things.

20:52.043 --> 20:53.670
What Deborah Cox song...

20:53.711 --> 20:57.924
Nobody supposed to be here
done the things I done.

20:57.966 --> 21:02.053
I was addicted to that life.

21:02.095 --> 21:04.722
Was always about that life.

21:04.764 --> 21:08.267
But now I'm living for Jesus.

21:08.309 --> 21:11.229
Won't He do it? Yes, He will.

21:11.270 --> 21:14.732
Won't He pull you
through? Yes, He will.

21:14.774 --> 21:18.903
I want you to turn to your
neighbor and say, "Neighbor."

21:18.945 --> 21:20.446
Neighbor.

21:23.199 --> 21:24.200
Well...

21:25.201 --> 21:27.120
...you always know
how to find me, don't you?

21:27.161 --> 21:28.788
Well, I went to the
back office first.

21:28.830 --> 21:31.040
Didn't expect to find
you up here, though.

21:31.082 --> 21:34.627
Must say, it's a
pleasant surprise.

21:34.669 --> 21:37.005
Well, my vocal warm
-up got carried away.

21:38.131 --> 21:40.049
It's been a few days.

21:40.091 --> 21:42.260
You made the withdrawal
from the church account yet?

21:42.301 --> 21:43.511
The loan got approved.

21:43.553 --> 21:45.054
So when you gonna roll
my stacks on to me?

21:45.096 --> 21:47.515
What you need it for?
What your little ass gonna do
with it?

21:47.557 --> 21:49.767
A wise woman once told me

21:49.809 --> 21:52.770
don't let not one nigga know
what you abouts to do.

21:52.812 --> 21:55.148
Just let these bitches watch.

21:56.232 --> 21:57.859
Now I'ma say this.

21:57.900 --> 22:00.778
How you gonna be disrespectful
in the house of the Lord?

22:01.571 --> 22:03.823
My gym, Ma.

22:04.824 --> 22:06.409
I finally got it.

22:09.454 --> 22:10.621
So...

22:12.165 --> 22:15.168
...this retirement plan
of yours is real, huh?

22:20.840 --> 22:22.008
Fine.

22:22.050 --> 22:24.093
I'ma cut the check tomorrow.

22:24.135 --> 22:25.636
You can come get it first thing.

22:48.117 --> 22:50.703
I know y'all ain't.
What type of ish is this?

22:51.662 --> 22:53.748
Y'all got me messed up,

22:53.790 --> 22:57.085
and y'all got the nerve to have
Chucalissa Challenger shorts on,
too.

22:58.086 --> 23:00.505
This might disqualify us
from our next stand.

23:00.546 --> 23:02.215
We were just gonna
upload it to Snap.

23:02.256 --> 23:03.633
It deletes as soon as it plays.

23:03.674 --> 23:05.343
Well, Terricka, thank God.

23:05.384 --> 23:07.470
Otherwise, you would have
everybody booty popping

23:07.512 --> 23:09.430
from Chucalissa
to doggone Pluto.

23:10.765 --> 23:13.434
"The bad bitch party.

23:13.476 --> 23:16.646
Invitation only to
the top 20 twerkers."

23:16.687 --> 23:19.107
Well, bless your
thotty little hearts.

23:19.899 --> 23:21.692
Y'all know what happen
at parties like this?

23:21.734 --> 23:24.362
We should be free to express
our sexual freedom

23:24.403 --> 23:27.907
without patriarchal consequence
of rape, rumor...

23:27.949 --> 23:29.450
Taylor, fuck y'all feminism.

23:29.492 --> 23:31.369
You don't want no stuff
out there on the Internet

23:31.410 --> 23:34.122
about y'all that look like this,
point blank, period!

23:34.163 --> 23:35.123
You do.

23:42.505 --> 23:45.091
Well, Terricka, I
gets paid for mine.

23:45.133 --> 23:47.343
You out here shaking
y'all shit for free.

23:47.385 --> 23:48.803
Where they do that at?

23:52.932 --> 23:54.225
You know what?

23:54.267 --> 23:56.102
Give me 50 toe touches
before y'all leave.

23:56.144 --> 23:57.854
Oh, man!

23:57.895 --> 23:59.355
Jump!

24:01.274 --> 24:03.151
Why you ain't jumpin', Captain?

24:05.945 --> 24:07.905
No, no, no.

24:07.947 --> 24:09.365
Make it 70.

24:12.743 --> 24:14.745
Girl, come on! Get up!

24:14.787 --> 24:16.622
Get your legs up
like you was getting 'em up

24:16.664 --> 24:18.082
- on that dadgum fence.
- High!

24:18.124 --> 24:19.584
- Point your toes!
- Please!

25:02.335 --> 25:03.419
Girl, where you been?

25:03.461 --> 25:05.546
From almost beatin'
a little bitch ass,

25:05.588 --> 25:09.217
but I'm ready to slay,
'cause God is in the building.

25:11.010 --> 25:12.220
Come on, girl, let's do this.

25:30.821 --> 25:31.739
I got to get down.

25:35.326 --> 25:37.078
Y'all keep practicing.

25:37.119 --> 25:38.454
I need to fill my water bottle.

25:49.215 --> 25:50.883
- Fuck!
- Oh, sorry.

25:52.635 --> 25:54.387
You in early.

25:59.058 --> 25:59.976
Can I see it?

26:02.353 --> 26:05.314
I just fell at practice again.

26:18.661 --> 26:19.870
It just sprained.

26:37.680 --> 26:39.181
What the hell?

26:39.223 --> 26:41.225
Oh, this is my
granddaddy recipe.

26:41.267 --> 26:42.935
Just a little
alcohol and pepper.

26:45.730 --> 26:47.523
Them dudes in Iraq would laugh.

26:49.525 --> 26:51.569
Pour that on, it's
quick fast, though.

26:53.779 --> 26:55.448
Unless you got a
bullet in your head.

26:56.532 --> 26:59.118
Then, well, it wouldn't
much help there.

27:13.424 --> 27:14.967
So when you gonna stop?

27:17.970 --> 27:19.138
Falling?

27:26.687 --> 27:29.815
Keyshawn, girl, bring your
titties. This baby up here
hungry.

27:29.857 --> 27:31.692
You know my ass can't feed her.

27:31.734 --> 27:32.735
Shit.

27:33.736 --> 27:37.448
Let me go before Uncle Clifford
start fussing louder than the
baby.

27:37.490 --> 27:38.657
All right.

27:51.879 --> 27:55.341
It's your girl. The M, I,
crooked letter, crooked letter,
I

27:55.383 --> 27:59.678
crooked letter, crooked letter,
I, humpback, humpback, I!

27:59.720 --> 28:02.681
Get 'em, Gidget and Mercedes!

28:02.723 --> 28:06.310
Come on down, 'cause we finna
show out as soon as y'all show
up.

28:06.352 --> 28:09.313
Meet me at the club.
It's going down.

28:19.657 --> 28:22.952
Can somebody please hold Reba
for me so I can finish this
post?

28:22.993 --> 28:24.203
No.

28:27.623 --> 28:29.875
Autumn, do me this favor.

28:58.237 --> 28:59.363
Another one.

29:09.665 --> 29:10.958
This is water.

29:11.000 --> 29:15.004
Slow down, high yellow.
You getting redboned.

29:15.671 --> 29:16.922
Fuck out of here!

29:22.094 --> 29:23.262
Buy me a drink?

29:25.431 --> 29:29.810
Throw it up for the baddest
bitches in all of Chucalissa.

29:33.439 --> 29:35.065
The trinity.

29:42.781 --> 29:44.867
Y'all need to throw some more,
throw some more.

29:44.909 --> 29:49.830
Go, Miss M-I,
crooked letter, crooked letter,
I,

29:49.872 --> 29:52.416
crooked letter,
crooked letter, I,

29:52.458 --> 29:55.002
humpback, humpback, I!

29:56.420 --> 29:57.630
Hey!

29:59.048 --> 30:02.218
Here we got my girl.
Get 'em, Gidget.

30:02.259 --> 30:03.844
No, no, no, no.

30:03.886 --> 30:05.554
Y'all better give
her more than that.

30:05.596 --> 30:07.973
Show her some
motherfucking appreciation.

30:08.015 --> 30:10.309
White girl used to cheer
for Ole Miss, y'all.

30:18.025 --> 30:19.944
Fuck that shit up, 'Cedes.

30:19.985 --> 30:23.072
Fuck it up. Fuck it up.

30:23.113 --> 30:24.740
Trinity.

30:26.158 --> 30:27.535
Trinity.

30:28.577 --> 30:31.288
Trinity.

30:45.553 --> 30:49.098
And then we got
my bottom bitch...

30:50.849 --> 30:53.519
...Mercedes!

30:56.146 --> 30:59.984
And she rides one every day,
all day, baby, baby!

31:02.319 --> 31:04.405
Hey, babe. Hey.

31:04.446 --> 31:06.323
How much for a dance?

31:11.870 --> 31:14.081
Well, well, well,

31:14.123 --> 31:17.751
looks like we got ourselves
a special guest.

31:17.793 --> 31:21.297
This my new girl,
y'all, with a new swirl.

31:21.338 --> 31:25.134
Give it up for Autumn Night.

31:25.175 --> 31:26.802
Turn it up in this bitch.

31:29.888 --> 31:31.140
Oh, Lord, she done...

31:32.308 --> 31:33.976
You all right,
baby. You all right.

31:34.018 --> 31:35.227
Girl...

31:36.395 --> 31:37.813
What you doing?

31:37.855 --> 31:40.399
Get your ass off that pole.

31:41.775 --> 31:43.235
Where you think you going?

31:53.287 --> 31:54.997
All right, now,
y'all in for a show.

31:55.039 --> 31:56.248
They taking y'all up.

31:56.290 --> 31:58.626
- Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
- Hey!

31:58.667 --> 32:01.420
Throw it up. Throw it up.

32:01.462 --> 32:04.173
Throw it up. Throw it up!

32:04.214 --> 32:05.215
Hey.

32:05.257 --> 32:06.133
Shit!

32:06.175 --> 32:08.636
I swear, yellow bitches,
I can't take it.

32:08.677 --> 32:09.845
What you do?

32:14.433 --> 32:15.643
Knuck if you buck.

32:15.684 --> 32:18.354
Knuck if you buck.
We got a Chucalissa tax night.

32:18.395 --> 32:21.482
Oh, that's right.
Make it rain on these bitches.

32:21.523 --> 32:23.025
Let's go.

32:23.567 --> 32:25.110
Yes! Throw that money.

32:29.448 --> 32:30.616
Hey!

32:30.658 --> 32:33.786
Bitch, if I ever see you
climbing your yellow ass on my
pole again,

32:33.827 --> 32:36.330
I swear before God
I will fuck you up on sight.

32:36.372 --> 32:37.706
Let go of me!

32:37.748 --> 32:40.000
The crowd liked it.
What's your problem?

32:40.042 --> 32:42.878
My problem is working
with sloppy-drunk bitches.

32:42.920 --> 32:44.088
You want to be a alky?

32:44.129 --> 32:45.964
Do that shit on
somebody else pole.

32:46.006 --> 32:47.883
You ain't finna get me hurt.

32:47.925 --> 32:49.468
I'm not drunk.

32:51.470 --> 32:54.264
Little mama, you need to go on
home and take care of yourself.

32:56.475 --> 32:58.769
- Why you even care?
- I don't.

32:58.811 --> 33:02.898
Only thing I care about is you
not getting up on my
motherfucking pole.

33:19.039 --> 33:21.709
Hey, yo, DJ Neva Scared.
What it do, though?

33:26.088 --> 33:27.047
Later.

33:27.089 --> 33:29.049
- Hey, Tequan, can I come?
- No.

33:30.843 --> 33:32.261
What up, man?

33:32.302 --> 33:33.679
Hey, you ain't want
your man to come?

33:33.721 --> 33:36.181
No. He got to stay.
He got to stay in the back.

34:07.212 --> 34:08.422
Real talk?

34:09.798 --> 34:12.634
The hook kind of knock,
but it ain't like it's up to me.

34:12.676 --> 34:14.470
You gonna need more than a hook
you can vibe out to

34:14.511 --> 34:16.597
for any of them girls
to really fuck with it.

34:16.638 --> 34:17.681
What you mean?

34:17.723 --> 34:19.516
It mean everything got to knock.

34:19.558 --> 34:23.395
Your shit got to have a spectrum
of swag but with that turned-up
energy.

34:23.437 --> 34:25.564
Right now your shit
more like salad.

34:27.024 --> 34:28.859
Romaine or frisée?

34:29.568 --> 34:32.488
Romaine, and you see,
that what I'm talking about.

34:32.529 --> 34:34.448
You got to pick the
right ingredients.

34:34.490 --> 34:37.618
You got to have that right
flavor, the right head, the
right clip,

34:37.659 --> 34:40.078
and that 808, got to
marinate that shit.

34:40.120 --> 34:41.997
Your perc sound
got to slice through that spice

34:42.039 --> 34:44.124
and make room for the bottom
on that tremolo.

34:44.166 --> 34:45.667
Nigga, you speaking
another language.

34:45.709 --> 34:48.712
Nigga, you be speaking
another language.

34:48.754 --> 34:52.549
What I mean is salad
is for rookies.

34:52.591 --> 34:55.677
You got to get on that next
level, making that souffle type
of shit.

35:02.017 --> 35:03.644
Why don't you come over?

35:03.685 --> 35:06.104
My mom's making
that ill quinoa stuffing, so...

35:06.146 --> 35:08.607
- Word?
- Yeah, you know, man.

35:08.649 --> 35:10.651
I dig it. Hop in the car.

35:10.692 --> 35:13.612
- You know your mama love me,
right? - Hey, hey. Stop that,
bro.

35:13.654 --> 35:15.364
- Gonna be my stepson, boy.
- Bro, bro, yo...

35:15.405 --> 35:16.657
- I promise you right now.
- Stop that.

35:20.202 --> 35:21.286
Race you to the top?

35:27.835 --> 35:29.002
Stop!

35:34.633 --> 35:36.009
Oh, God.

35:49.231 --> 35:52.067
When I used to live here
with my grandmother, it felt
like...

35:53.235 --> 35:54.403
...paradise.

35:57.114 --> 35:59.241
From what I've seen,
it ain't like that no more.

36:00.284 --> 36:02.452
Want to bring that back
for the folks here now.

36:05.706 --> 36:08.250
You think that casino you
buildin' is gonna change that?

36:08.292 --> 36:12.254
This casino could single
-handedly turn tourism in this
town around.

36:14.673 --> 36:16.341
So why is it so hush-hush?

36:16.383 --> 36:19.094
'Cause it's not a done deal yet.

36:22.180 --> 36:25.851
Can you imagine people
from all across the South

36:25.893 --> 36:27.936
could come vacay here?

36:27.978 --> 36:29.646
I mean, most Southerners
don't have passports,

36:29.688 --> 36:31.648
but at Promised
Land Casino Resorts,

36:31.690 --> 36:34.276
you'd be able to take your girl
to Rome, Paris, China.

36:35.277 --> 36:36.778
All around the world
be the thing...

36:36.820 --> 36:39.907
Yeah, so what does that do
for the people who live here?

36:48.832 --> 36:50.208
Take a good look.

36:51.126 --> 36:52.294
What else is here?

36:54.129 --> 36:56.006
I know this casino
ain't the answer

36:56.048 --> 36:57.925
to everything
that's gone wrong here, but...

36:59.718 --> 37:01.553
It's a start.

37:01.595 --> 37:04.681
So you're gonna make Chucalissa
great again, then, huh?

37:05.849 --> 37:07.351
Is this how you always are?

37:08.143 --> 37:10.479
So contrarian? So facetious?

37:12.940 --> 37:14.316
It's like you're
hanging up on me again.

37:15.734 --> 37:18.028
And the other night
I actually wanted to talk.

37:22.157 --> 37:23.158
So...

37:26.328 --> 37:27.955
Let's talk, then.

38:20.215 --> 38:21.216
Condom?

38:24.094 --> 38:25.012
No.

38:33.812 --> 38:35.480
You better go get one.

38:40.944 --> 38:41.820
Wait.

38:43.822 --> 38:45.365
Can you let me in?

38:46.783 --> 38:49.036
I want to keep this
engine humming.

38:59.254 --> 39:00.630
Be right back.

39:17.439 --> 39:18.815
Hey.

39:18.857 --> 39:21.777
Hey, y'all sell Magnums?

39:22.652 --> 39:23.653
No.

39:25.447 --> 39:27.532
We don't sell condoms,

39:27.574 --> 39:29.993
but we sure got Bibles
in our room for free.

39:34.456 --> 39:37.292
And, Jesus, we are
worthy of the blessing

39:37.334 --> 39:40.003
that You've given to us
and of that blessing that we've
taken.

39:40.045 --> 39:42.130
- Yes.
- So God so loved the world

39:42.172 --> 39:44.549
that He gave his
only begotten son.

39:44.591 --> 39:47.094
- And in Jesus' name, amen.
- Yes.

39:47.135 --> 39:48.470
Amen.

39:49.346 --> 39:52.140
So first order of business...

39:52.182 --> 39:56.269
we need to figure out
who gonna be preaching in my
place,

39:56.311 --> 39:59.106
since I got to go on up
to Mississippi Boulevard

39:59.147 --> 40:01.274
for they revival.

40:01.316 --> 40:04.528
Now, I was thinking
Clydell could.

40:07.489 --> 40:09.491
Something you have to
say, Sister Patrice?

40:10.408 --> 40:15.956
Well, we do want dollars instead
of cents in the collection
plate, don't it?

40:15.997 --> 40:18.083
- Sister Woodbine...
- I'm just saying.

40:18.125 --> 40:20.335
My singing after service
can only wake up half the folk

40:20.377 --> 40:23.004
lulled to sleep by his rambling.

40:23.547 --> 40:24.840
What?

40:24.881 --> 40:26.591
You think you can get up there
and do better?

40:26.633 --> 40:30.512
The one thing this mouth know
how to do is draw dollars from a
sinner's pocket.

40:32.722 --> 40:35.142
So that must be where
your daughter gets it from.

40:39.146 --> 40:42.524
Let he who is without sin
cast the first stone upon.

40:43.817 --> 40:46.945
That is what my savior said
of a woman that was scorned.

40:47.696 --> 40:50.866
And that is what I'd like to
preach on, next Sunday morn, if
I could...

40:50.907 --> 40:52.701
Now, Sister Woodbine...

40:53.785 --> 40:58.331
...you is the finest treasurer
this church done ever seen.

40:58.957 --> 41:01.960
The church building fund
would be in the red if it wasn't
for you.

41:02.002 --> 41:05.380
Fact, we just got that bank loan
'cause of me, and you said...

41:05.422 --> 41:09.384
And I will always be thankful
for your sacrifice.

41:10.385 --> 41:11.386
Now, look here.

41:12.304 --> 41:15.056
Women are the backbone
of this church,

41:15.098 --> 41:18.560
but we must submit
to our elders.

41:21.521 --> 41:24.441
Now, Elder Clydell

41:24.482 --> 41:27.986
will be preaching in
my place come Sunday.

41:30.363 --> 41:31.823
Next order of business.

41:38.246 --> 41:40.457
Oh, my God, yes!

41:40.498 --> 41:41.416
Yes!

41:42.459 --> 41:44.002
Oh, my God, yes!

41:49.883 --> 41:52.177
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

42:08.818 --> 42:10.570
Enjoy your stay.

42:32.968 --> 42:34.844
Luckily, there's a
Walgreens on the co...

42:43.061 --> 42:44.271
Fuck.

42:57.033 --> 42:58.952
Hey, Uncle Clifford!

42:58.994 --> 43:00.912
Hey, my flodgin' city girls.

43:02.205 --> 43:03.248
Look, I...

43:05.458 --> 43:06.751
See ya.

43:07.294 --> 43:09.212
Nigga, you is late.

43:09.254 --> 43:11.840
Big L done had to put
on the Bell Biv DeVoe CD.

43:11.881 --> 43:14.175
It's driving me out my mind.

43:16.511 --> 43:20.098
And since when your mama
start driving a hooptie?

43:28.940 --> 43:30.108
You coming in?

43:32.110 --> 43:33.528
Nah.

43:33.570 --> 43:35.322
Not tonight,
shorty, not tonight.

43:41.870 --> 43:43.621
Go on, get out of here.

43:47.667 --> 43:51.755
Pull out them ones, 'cause it
about to go down in the building
tonight.

43:51.796 --> 43:53.882
Big one for the old
heads up in the joint,

43:53.923 --> 43:57.010
the ones who graduated
Chucalissa High in '99, y'all.

43:57.052 --> 43:58.887
Y'all old as fuck.

43:58.928 --> 44:02.015
Bring out the cans, get on the
floor, but don't hurt nobody.

44:02.057 --> 44:06.603
We about to get that
work from the ladies!

44:06.644 --> 44:09.230
And speaking of ladies,
we got salt and pepper

44:09.272 --> 44:12.192
on the pole here
doing the swirl.

45:06.454 --> 45:09.249
All right, Sleeping Beauty,
go get them coins.

45:58.298 --> 46:00.049
What did Uncle Clifford say?

46:00.842 --> 46:03.678
Ain't no vitamin D in the VIP.

46:03.720 --> 46:05.472
I just want to put the tip in.

46:09.851 --> 46:10.935
There they go.

46:10.977 --> 46:14.522
Gidget, if you don't get your
flat ass back out on that
stage...

46:14.564 --> 46:17.609
Told you Uncle Clifford
got me working like a slave.

46:17.650 --> 46:19.819
Ain't it a new day
when a white girl in Mississippi

46:19.861 --> 46:21.488
claim she working like a slave?

46:22.655 --> 46:24.491
Now, Duffy, boy, why
you come so late?

46:24.532 --> 46:25.450
Oh, man.

46:25.492 --> 46:28.495
This flood's fucked up
for all them connects run away.

46:28.536 --> 46:31.080
I-55 clogged worser
than my meemaw heart.

46:31.122 --> 46:35.210
Well, let it be known,
I'm only stashing your load this
one time.

46:35.251 --> 46:36.920
You sell weed wings,
now, don't you?

46:36.961 --> 46:40.757
Well, weed about to be legal
once we get Obama back in office
a third term.

46:40.798 --> 46:42.967
But that Oxy you had me holding?

46:43.009 --> 46:44.636
No, sir. No, ma'am.

46:52.644 --> 46:54.020
It's all there.

46:54.062 --> 46:55.980
You know I don't
trust white people.

46:57.524 --> 46:59.234
Big L will help you load up your
truck out back.

47:00.360 --> 47:03.196
Hey, Sojourner, you
got one more minute

47:03.238 --> 47:05.240
before you need to come back
out here and pick this cotton.

47:05.281 --> 47:06.741
As long as it's green.

47:10.537 --> 47:12.247
I gots to go.

47:12.288 --> 47:14.666
Let me hold some before you go.

47:17.335 --> 47:18.586
It's for Keyshawn.

47:18.628 --> 47:20.547
She sprained her wrist yesterday
at practice.

47:21.756 --> 47:23.925
You sure it's not for your mama?

47:38.314 --> 47:40.149
My nipples just done
got hard as rubies.

47:40.191 --> 47:42.110
That's not the only thing.

47:42.151 --> 47:43.570
Look at this map.

47:43.611 --> 47:44.988
That's Corbin tract of land.

47:45.029 --> 47:46.531
And look right
across from there.

47:48.074 --> 47:50.410
And the price point.

47:50.451 --> 47:52.203
Oh, Lord.

47:52.245 --> 47:54.163
Don't make me fall the fuck out.

47:56.916 --> 47:58.751
Child, fuck some tea!

47:58.793 --> 48:01.379
You done poured a pot of hot
grits on these ears of mine.

48:03.715 --> 48:05.133
ID. Now, please.

48:05.174 --> 48:08.219
Damn. Why is your
nose so turnt up?

48:08.261 --> 48:10.305
Do you know what I
had to do to get this?

48:10.346 --> 48:13.683
I can only imagine how awful it
is to lay up on a cute-ass nigga

48:13.725 --> 48:15.435
for a little bit of
afternoon delight.

48:20.940 --> 48:22.191
What's wrong with you?

48:25.486 --> 48:26.821
He's calling me again.

48:28.698 --> 48:30.825
- What the hell? Give it!
- Get back.

48:30.867 --> 48:32.285
- Give it back!
- Get back.

48:32.327 --> 48:33.828
- Give...
- Get back!

48:40.376 --> 48:41.878

48:41.919 --> 48:43.630
Welcome to paradise.

48:45.506 --> 48:47.008

48:49.052 --> 48:50.053
Apples.

48:59.979 --> 49:01.230
Now...

49:02.482 --> 49:06.861
...it's just one more thing
I'ma need for you to do.

49:10.615 --> 49:13.284
I'm thinking zirconia
along the edges.

49:13.326 --> 49:15.578
Bitch, I want it to look
like the Milky Way

49:15.620 --> 49:18.414
just done exploded
all over my booty.

49:18.456 --> 49:21.626
I'm a bad bitch.
Why I ain't get no invite?

49:21.668 --> 49:23.086
They twerk better than me.

49:26.047 --> 49:29.050
- Now look.
- Oh, God.

49:29.092 --> 49:30.051
Girl.

49:31.886 --> 49:34.263
Shit. It's Terricka.

49:34.972 --> 49:36.057
Oh, hell, no.

49:38.226 --> 49:39.977
These little bitches

49:54.784 --> 49:56.619

49:56.661 --> 49:59.622

50:13.219 --> 50:15.263
Bitch, move your ass.

50:15.304 --> 50:16.305

50:22.103 --> 50:23.479

50:23.521 --> 50:25.273
but you gots to get the fuck up

50:25.314 --> 50:26.232
Oh, shit.

50:29.026 --> 50:31.612
- Walk faster.
- Okay.

50:31.654 --> 50:34.365
Where your little ass going
when you live here?

51:12.570 --> 51:14.781
Keep your eyes on your
own paper, partner.

51:20.161 --> 51:22.205
Welcome to Paradise.

51:22.246 --> 51:23.581
Password?

51:24.749 --> 51:25.792
Apples.

51:36.344 --> 51:38.262
Thanks for taking the time
to meet with me.

51:38.304 --> 51:40.431
I know you at work and shit,
but I wanted to explain that...

51:40.473 --> 51:41.599
Oh, good.

51:43.935 --> 51:47.563
'Cause my ears could use
another cup of tea.

51:56.531 --> 51:57.907
You around the corner?

51:57.949 --> 51:59.826
Good. I'm still here.

52:00.993 --> 52:02.870
I don't know why you call her.

52:02.912 --> 52:05.706
'Cause she need to know you done
turned this house around and
upside down.

52:05.748 --> 52:08.334
God damn it, Terricka.
What was you thinking?

52:08.376 --> 52:11.379
- Me and the girls was just
having fun. - No, no, no. Listen
to me.

52:11.420 --> 52:14.298
You cute. You get
it from your mama.

52:14.340 --> 52:17.343
But being banging sometime
more a burden than a blessing.

52:18.427 --> 52:19.470
Keep on.

52:19.512 --> 52:23.099
Some little baller gonna pull on
up, spit some whack-ass game,

52:23.140 --> 52:25.309
and just 'cause your little ass
want to be liked,

52:25.351 --> 52:27.478
next thing you know,
that nigga gonna have you

52:27.520 --> 52:29.397
bent over in the bathroom
with your panties

52:29.438 --> 52:31.399
around your ankles,
and you deserve it.

52:31.440 --> 52:33.401
- Deserve it?
- Yeah.

52:33.442 --> 52:36.195
The way you going, you gonna
end up on "13 and Pregnant."

52:36.237 --> 52:38.781
And what you gonna do then, huh?

52:38.823 --> 52:40.449
- What you gonna do?
- You know what?

52:40.491 --> 52:42.743
If I did get pregnant,

52:42.785 --> 52:46.122
at least I wouldn't give up
my baby like you gave up me.

52:54.338 --> 52:56.883
Oh, my imported rug.

52:57.842 --> 53:00.177
A bad-bitch party?
I'ma kill her.

53:00.219 --> 53:02.096
- Where she at?
- Where was you at?

53:02.847 --> 53:05.600
I was down in Jackson
visiting my sick sister.

53:05.641 --> 53:07.101
Terricka said she was
gonna spend the night

53:07.143 --> 53:08.728
with her girl
Jalissa this weekend.

53:10.104 --> 53:12.690
You done fell for
the oldest trick in the book.

53:12.732 --> 53:14.317
You should've just let her
spent the night at my house.

53:14.358 --> 53:15.943
So she can take some more
pictures in your floss?

53:15.985 --> 53:18.195
- That was a joke.
- It was inappropriate.

53:19.113 --> 53:22.116
No wonder she around
here shaking her ass.

53:22.158 --> 53:24.452
What? Whipped cream
in the Jacuzzi?

53:24.493 --> 53:26.454
You make her think
stuff like this is cool.

53:26.495 --> 53:28.748
I was the one that was trying
to talk her out of it.

53:28.789 --> 53:30.708
So you knew she was trying
to throw this party?

53:31.292 --> 53:33.920
- Un-fucking-believable.
- I tried to stop it.

53:36.005 --> 53:40.301
Look, I promised Cortez when he
died that I'd do right by his
child.

53:40.343 --> 53:41.761
She's my child, too.

53:41.802 --> 53:45.848
I know that,
which is why I've been open...

53:45.890 --> 53:47.767
open to her being on the team,

53:47.808 --> 53:50.895
but she's too focused
on her body...

53:50.937 --> 53:53.189
always in the mirror,

53:53.230 --> 53:55.107
always concerned
about how many likes she's
getting.

53:55.149 --> 53:56.525
What you trying to say?

53:59.236 --> 54:01.113
I don't want her on
the team no more.

54:01.906 --> 54:03.491
But, 'Chelle,

54:03.532 --> 54:06.327
that's the only time
I get to see her.

54:07.703 --> 54:08.746
I know.

54:09.747 --> 54:12.541
We need to refocus this energy

54:12.583 --> 54:14.919
on grades, volunteer work...

54:14.961 --> 54:17.338
anything but this dancing.

54:18.464 --> 54:19.340
Right.

54:20.341 --> 54:21.342
Well...

54:22.301 --> 54:25.179
...you the one
with custody, so...

54:26.973 --> 54:28.099
Yeah.

54:30.768 --> 54:32.186
You welcome.

54:36.607 --> 54:37.775
Thanks.

54:45.992 --> 54:50.246
If I was a stripper, my name
would be Sweet Potato Ponchita.

54:50.287 --> 54:53.749
That's the last thing I ate
and the color of my underwear.

54:53.791 --> 54:55.876
That's a little TMI,
don't you think?

54:57.670 --> 54:58.587
It might be.

54:59.880 --> 55:02.049
But I've been getting
too little information,

55:02.091 --> 55:04.552
or none at all, on
something called

55:04.593 --> 55:08.347
Promised Land Casino & Resort.

55:08.389 --> 55:10.683
Look, these are
confidential matters.

55:10.725 --> 55:12.601
Oh, well, good.

55:12.643 --> 55:13.811
I'm good at keeping secrets.

55:15.062 --> 55:18.858
Like if that wife of yours
rolled her flat ass up in here,

55:18.899 --> 55:20.443
I would not tell her

55:20.484 --> 55:23.320
how you've been dicking down
one of my gals.

55:23.362 --> 55:25.948
Look, I don't need to tell you
anything, man.

55:25.990 --> 55:28.200
Oh, but you best
tell me something.

55:28.242 --> 55:30.369
You seem to already know
a casino's coming.

55:30.411 --> 55:35.458
Well, unless they plan
on building a bridge over The
Pynk,

55:35.499 --> 55:38.586
it don't seem like I got too
much a place in Promised Land.

55:43.215 --> 55:44.633
Can you show me The Pynk?

55:46.969 --> 55:48.429
It's not there.

55:48.471 --> 55:51.724
Can you explain that to me,
Andre motherfucking Watkins?

55:51.766 --> 55:54.477
Like I said, I'm not allowed to
speak on confidential matters.

55:54.518 --> 55:58.230
Well, tell whoever you can speak
to on confidential matters
this...

55:58.272 --> 56:02.860
until hell freeze over
and the Devil learn how to ice
-skate...

56:03.819 --> 56:05.571
...I ain't going nowhere.

56:06.947 --> 56:08.532
- You sure about that?
- Oh, yeah.

56:08.574 --> 56:11.660
Seem like The Pynk got a hole in
its hull and no buckets for
bailing.

56:17.666 --> 56:19.460
You might be right about that.

56:21.962 --> 56:24.298
But you can have
some of this water...

56:26.300 --> 56:28.219
...'cause you's a thirsty nigga.

56:28.260 --> 56:29.345
Show him the door.

56:47.029 --> 56:51.117
Sorry to wake you up so late,
God-daddy, but I think we got us
a problem.

56:59.917 --> 57:00.960
Doggy.

57:01.001 --> 57:02.294
You lucky.

57:02.336 --> 57:06.090
You only had 30 minutes to spare
before this wire expired.

57:06.132 --> 57:08.509
You have a nice
night, Ms. Savage.
