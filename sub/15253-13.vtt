<i>w things that you might need to know.</i>

00:02.957 --> 00:04.223
<i>I'm going undercover into
Volkoff Industries.</i>

00:04.224 --> 00:06.225
<i>I'm gonna take them down from the inside.</i>

00:06.226 --> 00:10.697
<i>Hydra is the heart of Volkoff Industries,
but it has a flaw.</i>

00:10.698 --> 00:12.064
<i>So you just destroyed the whole system?</i>

00:12.065 --> 00:13.066
Of course not.

00:13.067 --> 00:14.367
I just downloaded all the data

00:14.368 --> 00:16.703
to a more secure backup location.

00:16.704 --> 00:19.172
All I want you to do is kill John Casey.

00:19.173 --> 00:20.373
<i> Throw me out the window.</i>

00:20.374 --> 00:21.975
There's a little platform down the.

00:21.976 --> 00:23.843
Give this to Chuck.

00:26.380 --> 00:27.630
Oh!

00:29.000 --> 00:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here

00:39.426 --> 00:40.893
Hey, what'd he say?

00:40.894 --> 00:42.061
John's in good hands.

00:42.062 --> 00:43.579
His doctor's a friend of mine.

00:43.580 --> 00:45.682
He thinks that he'll regain
consciousness in a day or two.

00:45.683 --> 00:47.083
Thank you.

00:47.084 --> 00:49.736
Casey's family; Chuck and
I do anything for family.

00:49.737 --> 00:52.405
Thanks for coming by, El.

00:52.406 --> 00:54.440
Of course.

00:54.441 --> 00:56.993
Thanks.

00:56.994 --> 01:00.246
Hey, he is the strongest
man I've ever met, okay?

01:00.247 --> 01:01.848
He'll pull through.

01:03.617 --> 01:04.950
You guys hear that?

01:04.952 --> 01:06.219
I think I did.

01:06.220 --> 01:08.171
I don't know, did I?

01:09.456 --> 01:11.624
That's a grunt, that is a Casey grunt.

01:11.625 --> 01:13.326
I think he's trying to say something.

01:14.461 --> 01:15.862
What do you got? Go ahead.

01:15.863 --> 01:16.963
Pants.

01:16.964 --> 01:19.465
Pants, pants, he said, "pants."

01:19.466 --> 01:21.300
Pants?

01:21.301 --> 01:22.702
Why pants?

01:22.703 --> 01:24.804
The man's never going to wear pants again.

01:24.805 --> 01:25.938
No, he means his pants.

01:25.939 --> 01:27.190
Maybe there's something in 'em.

01:27.191 --> 01:28.191
That's-- yeah, of course.

01:28.192 --> 01:30.876
Yeah, good observation.

01:33.280 --> 01:35.865
Yep, got it, here it is.
It's a, uh, like, half an eye.

01:35.866 --> 01:36.883
That's half an eyeball.

01:36.884 --> 01:38.551
What is he doing with that?

01:47.294 --> 01:51.097
Casey, where did you get this,
where did you get this eye?

01:51.098 --> 01:52.398
Sarah.

01:54.134 --> 01:56.969
Sarah.

01:56.970 --> 01:58.904
What'd he say?

02:00.240 --> 02:03.076
He said, "Sarah."

02:23.864 --> 02:26.165
Volkoff's security is down.

02:26.166 --> 02:27.500
We have exactly two minutes.

02:27.501 --> 02:28.701
Let's hope this tells us

02:28.702 --> 02:31.554
where he downloaded the Hydra Network to.

02:45.385 --> 02:46.819
You should answer it.

02:58.632 --> 03:00.066
Hello, Alexei.

03:00.067 --> 03:02.502
Frost, it's me.

03:02.503 --> 03:05.204
Yes, I know, I can see you.

03:05.205 --> 03:06.906
It's really dark there.

03:06.907 --> 03:08.040
Where are you?

03:08.041 --> 03:10.176
I'm just getting ready to go to bed.

03:10.177 --> 03:11.344
Oh.

03:11.345 --> 03:13.179
Okay, first ask me

03:13.180 --> 03:14.180
how my day was.

03:14.181 --> 03:16.149
How was your day?

03:16.150 --> 03:17.517
Awful.

03:17.518 --> 03:19.886
Andre wasn't working out
in Budapest, so I had

03:19.887 --> 03:22.522
to let him go... off a 20-story building.

03:22.523 --> 03:23.756
20 seconds.

03:23.757 --> 03:25.892
Oh, that's just awful.

03:25.893 --> 03:27.560
Well, I really should be going.

03:27.561 --> 03:28.561
All right.

03:28.562 --> 03:33.733
Sweet dreams, my sweet little pea.

03:33.734 --> 03:36.535
Good night, darling.

03:44.878 --> 03:46.879
Did you find its location?

03:46.880 --> 03:48.347
Looks like Volkoff is entrusting the Hydra

03:48.348 --> 03:51.250
to another person after all-- the Contessa.

03:51.251 --> 03:53.553
<i>We've received a message from Agent Walker.</i>

03:53.554 --> 03:55.555
Seems she'll be in the field a while longer.

03:55.556 --> 03:57.423
She's learned that Volkoff
is planning to transfer

03:57.424 --> 04:00.343
the Hydra Network to a
woman called the Contessa.

04:00.344 --> 04:02.628
General, what about the piece
of Hydra that I flashed on?

04:02.629 --> 04:05.181
Roni Eimacher designed Yuri's eye.

04:05.182 --> 04:07.433
There's a good chance he designed
something for the Contessa, too.

04:07.434 --> 04:09.035
General, there's got to
be another way, okay?

04:09.036 --> 04:10.570
Sarah pushed Casey out a window,
for crying out loud.

04:10.571 --> 04:12.605
This needs to end now,
she needs to come home.

04:12.606 --> 04:15.441
As I said before, my superiors
will follow up on Eimacher

04:15.442 --> 04:18.978
and the rest of the information
in the Hydra fragment.

04:18.978 --> 04:21.981
I'm sorry, but you're too close
to this, Agent Bartowski.

04:21.982 --> 04:23.499
Okay, fine, well,
then what am I supposed to do?

04:23.500 --> 04:24.717
You wait.

04:24.718 --> 04:27.186
That's all you can do.

04:28.889 --> 04:31.374
O- Okay, hey, it's gonna
be all right, buddy.

04:31.375 --> 04:33.125
You know what? We'll go outside,

04:33.126 --> 04:35.961
we'll get some fresh air,
play a little bocce. No.

04:36.930 --> 04:38.798
No, Morgan, I can't do this anymore.

04:38.799 --> 04:41.968
I watched my mom leave
us and my dad follow her.

04:41.969 --> 04:43.386
I let Sarah go and now Casey,

04:43.387 --> 04:45.104
and the whole time I did nothing--

04:45.105 --> 04:48.040
nothing-- while one man took
everything away from me.

04:49.776 --> 04:51.978
Ellie's right.

04:51.979 --> 04:53.512
Bartowskis take care of their family,

04:53.513 --> 04:57.416
and right now it's time I put
mine back together again.

04:57.417 --> 05:00.286
This was my father's mission,
and I have to finish it.

05:00.287 --> 05:02.288
We're gonna take down Volkoff. We? Really?

05:02.289 --> 05:04.624
'Cause you were kind of talking
in the first person there,

05:04.625 --> 05:05.791
and I'm not usually invited

05:05.792 --> 05:07.326
on these sort of climactic missions, so...

05:07.327 --> 05:08.377
I'm, I'm in, though.

05:08.378 --> 05:10.362
I mean, which guns do we grab?

05:10.363 --> 05:11.547
No guns.

05:11.548 --> 05:12.798
We need...

05:12.799 --> 05:14.734
Office supplies?

05:14.735 --> 05:18.737
No, Morgan, we need a plan.

05:35.221 --> 05:37.222
This is gonna work.

05:37.223 --> 05:38.524
Yeah, it is.

05:38.525 --> 05:39.742
Of course it is; it's a good plan.

05:39.743 --> 05:41.060
Thanks. You know, I've been doing

05:41.061 --> 05:43.329
a lot of yoga lately,
so I feel like I'm peaking

05:43.330 --> 05:46.032
mentally and physically,
so no problems there.

05:46.033 --> 05:48.367
You think this is what they call a, uh,

05:48.368 --> 05:49.568
suicide mission?

05:49.569 --> 05:51.037
What? No, of course not.

05:51.038 --> 05:52.905
Look, the first step is we find the guy

05:52.906 --> 05:55.841
Roni Eimacher.

05:57.577 --> 06:01.314
And Morgan, this is going to work.

06:01.315 --> 06:02.882
I promise.

06:02.883 --> 06:05.184
Of course.

06:06.253 --> 06:08.054
Oh, man, we're going to need some help.

06:30.494 --> 06:32.511
Get someone up here immediately.

06:32.512 --> 06:35.681
We've got a problem with the...

06:48.161 --> 06:50.446
What the hell is going on?

06:52.199 --> 06:55.117
Who's doing this?

07:02.042 --> 07:04.610
My God.

07:04.611 --> 07:06.245
He's still alive.

Armand.

07:54.450 --> 07:56.451
We have a problem

07:56.452 --> 07:59.454
in the form of Stephen Bartowski.

07:59.455 --> 08:01.723
Orion was killed by The Ring.

08:01.724 --> 08:02.958
Well, then somehow a dead man

08:02.959 --> 08:06.094
broke into my computer system last night.

08:06.095 --> 08:09.331
He wants something very dear to me.

08:09.332 --> 08:12.267
I'm gonna take Frost to a safer place.

08:13.002 --> 08:15.554
I want you to figure out

08:15.555 --> 08:19.808
where Orion has been hiding all these years.

08:21.010 --> 08:23.011
Where can I find you?

08:23.012 --> 08:28.116
I'll be visiting an old friend--
the Contessa.

08:36.525 --> 08:38.961
Hey, hey. Hey.

08:38.962 --> 08:40.913
Thanks for meeting me here.
I appreciate that.

08:40.914 --> 08:42.414
Hold on one second.

08:42.414 --> 08:43.832
There you are.

08:43.832 --> 08:45.167
And boom.

08:45.168 --> 08:46.168
Push mix for Ellie.

08:46.169 --> 08:47.636
Just what the doctor ordered.

08:47.637 --> 08:48.670
Oh, thanks, bro.

08:48.671 --> 08:49.755
I know you're busy; it's just,

08:49.756 --> 08:51.306
Ellie hates my music.

08:51.307 --> 08:52.774
But Rusted Root is rad, right?

08:52.775 --> 08:54.293
Yeah, yeah.

08:54.294 --> 08:55.544
They're rad-radical.

08:55.545 --> 08:56.712
Awesome. Good.

08:56.713 --> 08:58.680
Happy to help. Plan is in place.

08:58.681 --> 09:02.117
No deep terror can eat away
at me from the inside now.

09:02.118 --> 09:03.485
"Deep terror"?

09:03.486 --> 09:06.121
Did I say, "deep terror"?

09:06.122 --> 09:07.289
You said, "deep terror."

09:07.290 --> 09:09.191
Huh. Listen, I got to run.

09:09.192 --> 09:10.859
I still got to find someone to make

09:10.860 --> 09:12.110
Ellie's placenta into vitamin pills.

09:12.111 --> 09:13.695
I... have to unhear that.

09:13.696 --> 09:14.863
How do I unhear that?

09:14.864 --> 09:16.531
I don't know how to unhear that.

09:16.532 --> 09:20.535
Um... one more thing really quick.

09:20.536 --> 09:21.803
I'm gonna be gone

09:21.804 --> 09:24.039
for a little while, so I took the liberty of

09:24.040 --> 09:25.824
setting up some protection for you and Ellie

09:25.825 --> 09:27.209
through the CIA, just in case.

09:27.210 --> 09:28.210
Protection?

09:28.211 --> 09:29.578
Just in case.

09:29.579 --> 09:31.313
But promise me, if anything

09:31.314 --> 09:33.465
out of the ordinary comes up,
you call that number

09:33.466 --> 09:35.384
and an undercover team will
show up at your front door,

09:35.385 --> 09:37.352
and they will take you
anywhere you need to go.

09:37.353 --> 09:39.655
Well, thanks for everything, Chuck.

09:39.656 --> 09:40.656
Yeah.

09:51.017 --> 09:53.434
Pardon me, Jeff.

09:58.358 --> 10:01.710
I bet you Bartowski put a bunch of
indie crap on this-this push mix.

10:01.711 --> 10:03.378
It's like, we get it, dude, you're cool.

10:03.379 --> 10:05.781
You know. Has he no respect for the unborn.

10:05.782 --> 10:08.417
The first sounds that a
child hears should not be

10:08.418 --> 10:09.534
from an audio disc.

10:09.535 --> 10:11.186
What is the matter with these people?

10:11.187 --> 10:13.121
Yeah, they should be raw, unfiltered, live.

10:13.122 --> 10:16.591
This baby needs a performance,

10:16.592 --> 10:19.528
delivery room style.

10:19.529 --> 10:23.265
This baby needs... Jeffster!

10:23.266 --> 10:24.967
<i> So I tracked</i>

10:24.968 --> 10:28.603
Eimacher through his online
Settlers of Catan league.

10:28.604 --> 10:30.605
Ooh. Yeah. Turns out,

10:30.606 --> 10:32.441
he is a engineering professor at

10:32.442 --> 10:34.726
UC Irvine.

10:34.727 --> 10:36.655
That's great, great. This will be easy.

10:36.656 --> 10:38.516
I've done a thousand missions like...

10:38.517 --> 10:42.064
But wait a minute...

10:42.065 --> 10:44.422
told us to back off.

10:44.423 --> 10:47.445
I actually don't think we need Castle.

10:49.970 --> 10:51.854
Oh, my God, where am I?

10:51.855 --> 10:54.257
Is this a bathroom?

10:54.258 --> 10:56.159
No. This is hell.

10:56.160 --> 10:57.677
Listen, you're gonna

10:57.678 --> 10:58.995
tell us who the Contessa is.

10:58.996 --> 11:01.064
The Contessa? I have no idea

11:01.065 --> 11:03.066
who you're talking about. Do not play games

11:03.067 --> 11:04.767
with us, Roni Eimacher.

11:04.768 --> 11:08.404
Roni Eimacher? My name's Barry Greenfield.

11:09.139 --> 11:11.574
Barry Green... Oops.

11:15.245 --> 11:16.379
If you'll excuse us

11:16.380 --> 11:18.714
for just a moment, Mr. Greenfield.

11:21.035 --> 11:23.519
That is not Roni Eimacher!

11:23.520 --> 11:25.455
I know it's not Roni Eimacher!

11:25.456 --> 11:27.990
But you got to admit,
looks a lot like him. Well, it's...

11:27.991 --> 11:30.560
Okay. All right. Fine, fine, fine.
What are we gonna do?

11:30.561 --> 11:32.729
Gonna tranq him, then we'll just
put him back where we found him.

11:32.730 --> 11:33.896
Perfect. No, wait a minute.

11:33.897 --> 11:35.198
He's seen half of our faces.

11:35.199 --> 11:36.966
Chuck, does that mean we have to,
uh... you know...

11:36.967 --> 11:38.885
Are you crazy?! We just have to find

11:38.886 --> 11:40.336
the real Eimacher, all right?

11:40.337 --> 11:42.238
And this time, bring the picture!

11:45.976 --> 11:47.727
Please don't hurt me, I'm just

11:47.728 --> 11:49.946
an engineer... Wait.

11:49.947 --> 11:52.015
Am I in a bathroom?

11:52.016 --> 11:53.349
What? No... geez! No.

11:53.350 --> 11:54.784
It-it's hell. I mean, it's clearly...

11:54.785 --> 11:56.285
It's clearly hell.

11:56.286 --> 11:57.620
We went through all this trouble--
it's hell!

11:57.621 --> 11:59.622
All right? We know you designed

11:59.623 --> 12:00.823
the glass eye that Alexei Volkoff

12:00.824 --> 12:02.592
stored his Hydra Network on.

12:02.593 --> 12:04.026
You two are in serious trouble.

12:04.027 --> 12:05.161
Volkoff kidnapped me

12:05.162 --> 12:06.996
and forced me to create the Hydra Device.

12:06.997 --> 12:09.382
He said he'd kill everyone I know,
if I didn't do it.

12:11.035 --> 12:13.102
So you've never met the Contessa?

12:13.103 --> 12:14.837
The Contessa?

12:14.838 --> 12:16.973
No, that's where he took
me to-to design the Hydra.

12:16.974 --> 12:19.108
What does that mean?

12:20.978 --> 12:22.345
The Contessa's not a person.

12:22.346 --> 12:23.646
It's a...

12:38.662 --> 12:40.696
<i>Welcome to The Contessa.</i>

12:40.697 --> 12:41.931
What do you think?

12:41.932 --> 12:43.399
Beautiful.

12:43.400 --> 12:45.701
Yeah. Well, um...

12:45.702 --> 12:48.704
bought the old girl years ago,
on craigslist Dubai.

12:48.705 --> 12:50.506
She's got anti-aircraft missiles,

12:50.507 --> 12:52.208
sonar stealth technology,

12:52.209 --> 12:54.927
and an old-fashioned ice cream parlor.

12:54.928 --> 12:58.848
I like to think of her as
my floating fortress of fun.

12:58.849 --> 12:59.849
Captain!

12:59.850 --> 13:01.317
Welcome. Good to see you.

13:02.853 --> 13:05.221
The Hydra Network must
be on the ship somewhere.

13:05.222 --> 13:06.589
This is our chance.

13:06.590 --> 13:08.307
Yes. But Volkoff brought us here

13:08.308 --> 13:09.725
because he's nervous about something.

13:09.726 --> 13:10.893
Wants to stay mobile.

13:10.894 --> 13:13.029
We have to go for the Hydra tonight.

13:13.030 --> 13:16.282
And nothing can get in our way.

13:18.318 --> 13:19.835
Let's do this.

13:22.322 --> 13:25.775
I told you to take the flippers off!

13:31.248 --> 13:33.015
We're in.

13:36.304 --> 13:37.471
Okay.

13:37.472 --> 13:39.640
Okay. All right, listen...

13:39.641 --> 13:41.142
We gotta get down to the lower decks, okay?

13:41.143 --> 13:44.044
That's where Eimacher said the server was.

13:44.045 --> 13:46.430
Hey, hey.

13:46.431 --> 13:48.749
What's going on, buddy? We gotta go.
You never told me you were

13:48.750 --> 13:50.217
gonna be wearing something
else underneath that wetsuit.

13:50.218 --> 13:51.986
Morgan, are you telling me

13:51.987 --> 13:53.787
you're not wearing any clothes under there?

13:53.788 --> 13:56.490
Underwear, Chuck.
I'm wearing underwear. I mean...

13:56.491 --> 13:57.992
'Cause how do you even fit
anything else under there?

13:57.993 --> 13:59.126
Where does it all go?

13:59.127 --> 14:00.394
It doesn't matter, doesn't matter.

14:00.395 --> 14:01.629
You know what? I'm cool like this.

14:01.630 --> 14:02.663
I look like a seal...

14:02.664 --> 14:03.864
a seal that does yoga.

14:03.865 --> 14:05.166
Yeah. Yoga seal.

14:05.167 --> 14:07.201
Yoga seal. All right, just... Yeah.

14:07.202 --> 14:09.219
Just don't squeak. Copy.

14:15.577 --> 14:18.512
We're as close as we're ever going to get.

14:18.513 --> 14:21.748
Tonight, whether or not we find the Hydra,

14:21.749 --> 14:22.983
you're going home.

14:22.984 --> 14:24.385
What do you mean?

14:24.386 --> 14:25.636
No, I can't. I promised Chuck

14:25.637 --> 14:27.388
that I wouldn't come home without you.

14:27.389 --> 14:29.823
Yes. I made a lot of promises, too.

14:29.824 --> 14:32.126
I don't want you to become me.

14:32.127 --> 14:35.896
And I will not allow my
son to become his father.

14:35.897 --> 14:40.033
So, tonight, it ends.

14:45.773 --> 14:47.157
Armand?

14:47.158 --> 14:50.678
Whatever system Orion used to
contact you is untraceable.

14:50.679 --> 14:52.179
I need to figure out

14:52.180 --> 14:54.148
if he's working with someone on the inside.

14:54.149 --> 14:56.317
I told you to find Orion.

14:56.318 --> 14:58.085
I'm well aware of his connections

14:58.086 --> 15:00.254
inside my organization.

15:00.255 --> 15:03.090
Then let me prove Frost's
loyalty's only to you.

15:03.091 --> 15:05.559
Give me access to Hydra.

15:05.560 --> 15:08.278
Hold on.

15:14.135 --> 15:16.170
Do it.

15:16.171 --> 15:19.156
It's not on this deck.

15:20.692 --> 15:22.042
What the...?!

15:22.827 --> 15:23.861
Chuck?

15:23.862 --> 15:25.162
Sarah!

15:31.536 --> 15:33.837
What are you two doing here?

15:33.838 --> 15:34.838
Taking down Volkoff.

15:34.839 --> 15:35.956
How did you even find us?

15:35.957 --> 15:37.291
You shouldn't be here!

15:37.292 --> 15:38.359
She's right. This is

15:38.360 --> 15:39.627
my mission, and it's too dangerous.

15:39.628 --> 15:40.628
No. No, no.

15:40.629 --> 15:41.862
This is our mission, okay?

15:41.863 --> 15:43.897
I never should have let you go;
either one of you.

15:43.898 --> 15:45.599
You don't have to do this alone.
We're here to help.

15:45.600 --> 15:47.468
Seriously, guys, it's going to be okay.

15:47.469 --> 15:50.170
Chuck has a plan.

15:51.439 --> 15:54.074
The server room is right down there.

15:58.563 --> 16:01.381
Mom. Mom! Mom.

16:06.321 --> 16:08.906
When we get back,
we need to have a serious talk

16:08.907 --> 16:10.824
about the benefits of tranq guns.

16:12.494 --> 16:14.378
There's the door to the server room.

16:14.379 --> 16:15.712
I'll try to hack in.

16:16.531 --> 16:17.998
Hang on a second.

16:17.999 --> 16:20.301
This dude's got a key card, right?

16:20.302 --> 16:21.735
Maybe this will help us

16:21.736 --> 16:23.971
with the way in. Uh, Morgan, we don't know

16:23.972 --> 16:25.372
what's going to happen if you do that.

16:27.409 --> 16:28.642
See? Easy.

16:28.643 --> 16:30.911
Wait. This can't be right.

16:30.912 --> 16:32.479
Oh!

16:40.955 --> 16:43.157
Guys! I think I'm going to die in here!

16:43.158 --> 16:44.992
Morgan! What's happening? Lasers.

16:44.993 --> 16:48.128
Lots and lots of lasers.
And-and they cut things!

16:48.129 --> 16:50.431
Hang on, buddy!

16:50.432 --> 16:52.766
Hang on, buddy. I'm in the system.

16:54.836 --> 16:57.171
Awesome,

16:57.172 --> 16:58.305
Chuck! Nice work!

16:58.306 --> 16:59.640
You got the door to the server room open!

16:59.641 --> 17:01.975
Now, just turn off the lasers!

17:01.976 --> 17:04.511
I don't think I can do it from here.

17:04.512 --> 17:06.113
Morgan!

17:06.114 --> 17:07.881
If you can get into the server room,

17:07.882 --> 17:09.148
you can power them down

17:09.150 --> 17:10.884
and open the door for us.

17:10.885 --> 17:13.020
Are you crazy? He can't go
through all those lasers!

17:13.021 --> 17:14.454
You kidding me? I can't
go through those lasers!

17:14.455 --> 17:16.190
This could be the only chance

17:16.191 --> 17:18.108
you have. We have to hurry.

17:21.563 --> 17:23.130
Yes, you can.

17:23.131 --> 17:24.832
Yes you can. Morgan-- I...!

17:24.833 --> 17:26.165
I can do this!

17:26.166 --> 17:27.201
'Cause I'm... a yogi.

17:27.202 --> 17:28.569
All right? I am peaking mentally...

17:28.569 --> 17:31.238
and physically.

17:31.239 --> 17:35.109
I just need to use my Ujjayi breath, okay?

17:35.110 --> 17:36.877
Come on.

17:53.661 --> 17:55.763
Warrior Two pose.

17:55.764 --> 17:59.833
Transition... slowly...

17:59.834 --> 18:03.470
into Warrior Three pose.

18:03.471 --> 18:05.005
Easy...

18:16.985 --> 18:18.852
I didn't know I could do that.

18:28.463 --> 18:30.097
Guys!

18:30.098 --> 18:31.298
I'm stuck!

18:31.299 --> 18:32.666
Okay. Okay, okay, buddy.

18:32.667 --> 18:34.401
I'm gonna try something else.

18:35.520 --> 18:38.305
Easy... easy.

18:38.306 --> 18:39.873
Your strength is in your core.

18:41.609 --> 18:43.544
Oh, God!

18:43.545 --> 18:44.945
Oh! Not good!

18:44.946 --> 18:46.146
Lasers are moving, now!

18:46.147 --> 18:47.247
Not good!

18:47.248 --> 18:48.565
No. No, no, worse now!

18:48.566 --> 18:50.384
Worse now! Oh God!

18:50.385 --> 18:52.619
It's slicing through my wetsuit!

18:52.620 --> 18:55.338
Morgan?! Are you okay?

19:08.887 --> 19:10.137
Morgan!

19:10.138 --> 19:12.305
Morgan, don't you ever do that again.

19:13.141 --> 19:14.141
It's all right.

19:14.142 --> 19:16.560
It's okay.

19:18.913 --> 19:21.031
Yeah.

19:22.517 --> 19:24.318
You're not cold? MORGAN: Yeah.

19:37.999 --> 19:39.716
Uh... Morgan...

19:40.468 --> 19:41.602
Here.

19:41.603 --> 19:43.837
I'm glad you're okay.

19:43.838 --> 19:45.706
Thank you. Thanks. And thank you for this.

19:45.707 --> 19:47.257
Although I don't think it's going to...

19:47.258 --> 19:50.127
fit over these shoulders;
my lats have been, uh...

19:50.128 --> 19:51.745
It's, you know...

19:51.746 --> 19:54.464
It's just-just kind of, barely.

19:59.554 --> 20:01.488
Careful, Chuck.

20:01.489 --> 20:02.439
Don't touch that.

20:02.440 --> 20:04.808
Okay.

20:04.809 --> 20:06.560
I'm in.

20:06.561 --> 20:08.779
All of Volkoff's contacts are here.

20:08.780 --> 20:11.231
I am transferring Hydra

20:11.232 --> 20:14.618
to a CIA offshore server...

20:16.037 --> 20:17.270
...now.

20:23.912 --> 20:25.145
Hey, babe!

20:25.146 --> 20:27.147
Watch me glide.

20:27.148 --> 20:29.649
Devon! My water just broke.

20:30.752 --> 20:32.352
But you're not due yet.

20:32.353 --> 20:33.954
What is Baby Clara thinking?

20:33.955 --> 20:35.339
Well, it happened about ten minutes ago.

20:35.340 --> 20:36.990
I took a shower, and had a protein bar,

20:36.991 --> 20:38.091
and now I'm ready to go, so...

20:38.092 --> 20:39.309
Let's go have a baby.

20:39.310 --> 20:40.460
Okay.

20:40.461 --> 20:42.646
I'm prepared for this. Yes, you are.

20:42.647 --> 20:45.198
You have a plan. You have an awesome plan.

20:47.735 --> 20:50.270
Okay, everything's gonna be just fine.

20:53.608 --> 20:57.010
Where's my push mix?
I just got it from Chuck.

20:57.011 --> 20:58.879
It couldn't have disappeared.
Devon! It's fine, really.

20:58.880 --> 21:01.031
I don't need a push mix. Let's just go.

21:01.032 --> 21:02.849
I'm going to grab some water for the road.

21:04.752 --> 21:06.670
I'm not ready for this.

21:06.671 --> 21:09.172
Perfect plan not perfect.
Oh, God! It's gone!

21:09.173 --> 21:10.791
No push mix: no baby.

21:10.792 --> 21:12.726
It's all gone!

21:19.550 --> 21:21.818
Are you expecting someone?

21:27.475 --> 21:28.609
Mrs. Woodcomb?

21:28.610 --> 21:30.410
Your transport service has arrived.

21:30.411 --> 21:31.528
Let's move quickly.

21:31.529 --> 21:34.114
Devon, did you arrange this?

21:34.115 --> 21:35.983
<i> Voice identification required.</i>

21:35.984 --> 21:37.718
Damn it.

21:37.719 --> 21:39.319
Only Volkoff can access this.

21:39.320 --> 21:41.788
It's connected to his voice.

21:41.789 --> 21:43.924
Okay, Chuck,

21:43.925 --> 21:45.926
you and Morgan need to get
out of here right now.

21:45.927 --> 21:47.577
No. You all need to get out of here.

21:47.578 --> 21:49.579
Volkoff will be here any second.
No, not without you.

21:49.580 --> 21:52.565
Hey, we're all going, okay? Let's go.

22:08.399 --> 22:12.252
Frost, I am very disappointed in you.

22:13.421 --> 22:17.374
"Death is the solution to all problems."

22:19.961 --> 22:21.244
That's a quote

22:21.245 --> 22:25.332
from my favorite poet and humanitarian...

22:25.333 --> 22:27.250
Joseph Stalin.

22:38.446 --> 22:42.516
Good job I didn't tell you
all my secrets, isn't it?

22:42.517 --> 22:44.317
Just know...

22:44.318 --> 22:46.787
you did this.

22:46.788 --> 22:48.321
Shoot them.

22:48.322 --> 22:49.990
All right, then shoot 'em,

22:49.991 --> 22:54.227
but not before I get one shot off,
and one is all I need.

22:54.228 --> 22:56.146
Get out of here, Chuck.

22:56.147 --> 22:57.898
Morgan, go.

22:57.899 --> 22:58.699
Go! Now!

22:58.700 --> 23:00.400
Come on, Sarah.

23:02.036 --> 23:04.404
Come on, come on, come on. Mom, come on!

23:04.405 --> 23:06.807
You do realize for them to get out
of here alive, you have to stay.

23:06.808 --> 23:08.542
Yes, I know.

23:11.829 --> 23:13.013
Run!

23:13.014 --> 23:14.247
Mom!

23:14.248 --> 23:15.382
Chuck, come on! Mom!

23:19.303 --> 23:21.221
Are you okay? Yeah.

23:21.222 --> 23:22.622
Look, we better get out of here.

23:22.623 --> 23:24.174
No, no, this wasn't part of my plan.

23:24.175 --> 23:26.109
Come on, we have to go.

23:28.693 --> 23:32.446
You have nothing to say to me?
No perfect excuses?

23:32.680 --> 23:33.847
No "Trust me, Alexei"?

23:33.848 --> 23:35.148
No. Nothing?!

23:38.453 --> 23:40.904
Give me the gun.

23:46.611 --> 23:49.112
No one touches my Frost.

23:51.366 --> 23:53.617
Armand.

23:57.622 --> 23:58.672
Come, please.

23:58.673 --> 24:00.374
You need to see this.

24:00.375 --> 24:02.959
I have something I've got to show you.

24:04.979 --> 24:06.747
Please,

24:06.748 --> 24:08.749
you have to see this.

24:08.750 --> 24:14.087
"Meet me at Twin Pines cabin.
Godspeed, my love--

24:14.088 --> 24:16.223
Orion."

24:17.091 --> 24:18.692
What is this?

24:18.693 --> 24:21.094
You tell me.

24:21.095 --> 24:24.898
Armand found it on our
server a few moments ago.

24:26.034 --> 24:28.001
I've never seen this before.

24:28.002 --> 24:29.686
Really?

24:29.687 --> 24:33.740
Because this message led
Armand to hundreds more.

24:33.741 --> 24:37.077
You've been talking to
Orion every day for years.

24:37.078 --> 24:41.114
Night after night, behind my back!

24:41.115 --> 24:43.116
That's why you didn't want me near you.

24:43.117 --> 24:46.753
I have no idea what you are talking about.

24:46.754 --> 24:49.689
Stop lying to me!

24:51.526 --> 24:54.428
You knew your husband was alive.

24:54.429 --> 24:57.264
You knew the whole damn time.

24:57.265 --> 25:00.033
I believed in you.

25:00.034 --> 25:02.803
You want the truth, Alexei?

25:02.804 --> 25:06.473
The truth is, my husband, alive or dead,

25:06.474 --> 25:10.010
will always be ten times the man you are.

25:11.512 --> 25:13.780
And every moment that I was with you,

25:13.781 --> 25:16.283
I was thinking of him.

25:26.928 --> 25:30.580
I'm going to visit your husband,

25:30.581 --> 25:33.700
and when I come back...

25:33.701 --> 25:37.103
I'll bring you his body.

25:56.591 --> 25:58.525
Moron Grimes.

26:05.233 --> 26:07.534
You're here.

26:08.252 --> 26:09.736
Of course, I am.

26:11.806 --> 26:13.573
I, uh...

26:13.574 --> 26:15.575
I brought your bonsai.

26:15.576 --> 26:17.811
Thought it might feel more like home.

26:17.812 --> 26:19.813
Would have brought your guns,
but don't think they really

26:19.814 --> 26:21.798
would have let me through
the door with those, so...

26:24.802 --> 26:27.054
No, save your strength, Dad.

26:27.055 --> 26:30.390
The doctor says you need to rest.

26:31.993 --> 26:35.195
Listen, I, uh...

26:35.196 --> 26:39.282
I... kind of like having my dad around.

26:40.601 --> 26:44.704
I don't just like it;
I've gotten to used to it, so...

26:44.705 --> 26:46.506
I've spent most of my life thinking

26:46.507 --> 26:49.309
that my dad was dead, and...

26:49.310 --> 26:52.445
I'm not ready to do it again, okay?

27:05.393 --> 27:07.227
My contractions are only ten minutes apart.

27:07.228 --> 27:10.063
Let's go ahead and administer
the pitocin, please.

27:10.064 --> 27:11.815
Can I get ten cc's of Compazine?

27:11.816 --> 27:13.066
I'm a little nauseous.

27:13.067 --> 27:15.101
Of course, Dr. Woodcomb.

27:16.404 --> 27:18.471
Is your husband all right?

27:18.472 --> 27:19.689
Yeah.

27:19.690 --> 27:20.941
He'll snap out of it.

27:20.942 --> 27:22.843
He was like this once before,

27:22.844 --> 27:24.044
during his exit exams.

27:24.045 --> 27:25.879
He'll be fine, I'm sure.

27:42.296 --> 27:45.549
This is the location Orion
listed on his communique.

27:45.550 --> 27:50.003
Then let's finally put
this ghost in the ground.

27:50.004 --> 27:52.689
I'll do this myself.

27:52.690 --> 27:55.141
Stay here and keep guard.

28:09.407 --> 28:11.057
Orion--

28:11.058 --> 28:13.159
we finally meet.

28:19.300 --> 28:22.302
Charles. Hello, Alexei.

28:22.303 --> 28:24.571
I believe you were looking for me.

28:42.393 --> 28:44.094
Morning, sunshine.L.

28:45.663 --> 28:49.399
Oh, you seem very proud.

28:49.400 --> 28:53.270
Using your father's toys to lure me in.

28:53.271 --> 28:56.239
Well...

28:56.240 --> 28:59.109
I'm not dead yet,
so you must want something.

28:59.110 --> 29:01.762
You're right, actually.

29:01.763 --> 29:04.180
There is still something I want.

29:05.800 --> 29:09.619
I hadn't figured you as the vengeful type.

29:09.620 --> 29:13.857
Is it because I spoke
disparagingly about your father?

29:13.858 --> 29:17.294
This is because you took my mother from him.

29:17.295 --> 29:20.197
You took his whole life, and his death...

29:20.198 --> 29:21.431
His death was ages ago.

29:21.432 --> 29:24.201
Isn't it time you moved on?

29:24.202 --> 29:26.503
Bearing grudges.

29:26.504 --> 29:28.922
A bit childish, isn't it?

29:30.608 --> 29:33.160
You can't kill me.

29:33.161 --> 29:35.979
For the same reason your mother
and your girlfriend couldn't.

29:35.980 --> 29:39.449
What do you think's gonna happen
to all those people you love

29:39.450 --> 29:42.986
if you put a bullet between my eyes?

29:44.922 --> 29:47.190
I have access

29:47.191 --> 29:49.976
<i>to everyone.</i>

30:19.156 --> 30:21.558
I have to admit, it was a good plan.

30:21.559 --> 30:24.194
Using my own jealousy against me.

30:24.195 --> 30:26.430
But it had its problems.

30:26.431 --> 30:29.065
How could it not?

30:29.066 --> 30:32.268
After all, you are your father's son.

30:33.438 --> 30:35.739
Just know this.

30:35.740 --> 30:38.241
If it wasn't for you,

30:38.242 --> 30:42.328
<i>everyone could have gotten
out of this alive.</i>

31:10.641 --> 31:13.143
And now for the sister.

31:14.946 --> 31:16.813
I told my men to kill your mother,

31:16.814 --> 31:20.400
<i>if they didn't hear from me.</i>

31:22.820 --> 31:24.588
And they won't.

31:24.589 --> 31:28.725
So... cheers, Charles.

31:28.726 --> 31:32.162
Here's to a family reunion.

31:33.865 --> 31:36.733
I can't believe you haven't
figured out the solution yet.

31:36.734 --> 31:38.969
Solution?

31:38.970 --> 31:41.271
To what?

31:43.107 --> 31:44.407
Gotcha.

31:44.408 --> 31:47.294
"Death is the solution

31:47.295 --> 31:49.679
to all problems." Got it, Chuck.

31:49.680 --> 31:52.015
We got the pass code.

31:54.952 --> 31:56.402
What is this?

31:57.922 --> 32:02.692
"Death is the solution to all problems."

32:04.278 --> 32:07.664
That fake communique you
received from Orion--

32:07.665 --> 32:14.337
that wasn't just a play on your
weird affection for my mom.

32:14.338 --> 32:17.207
That was also a virus
that my father created.

32:17.208 --> 32:19.476
And now that I have your pass code,

32:19.477 --> 32:22.646
that virus will begin to transfer

32:22.647 --> 32:24.781
the entire Hydra Network

32:24.782 --> 32:27.217
onto this computer.

32:27.218 --> 32:31.555
Technically, I guess you could say that

32:31.556 --> 32:33.957
in the end,

32:33.958 --> 32:37.493
it was Stephen J.
Bartowski who took you down.

32:39.630 --> 32:42.799
Fitting. Don't you think?

32:44.368 --> 32:47.370
You know, my father--
he taught me a lot of things.

32:47.371 --> 32:50.807
Like, looks can be deceiving.

32:59.784 --> 33:02.419
Fight for your family.

33:02.420 --> 33:05.338
Something's wrong.

33:07.008 --> 33:10.043
Mary, quick!

33:10.044 --> 33:11.177
Oh!

33:20.805 --> 33:23.189
<i> And of course,</i>

33:23.190 --> 33:25.558
never use a gun...

33:27.111 --> 33:29.312
...unless you absolutely have to.

33:32.583 --> 33:36.152
Yeah, I probably should have told you,
I have this... thing

33:36.153 --> 33:39.055
about bullets.

33:39.056 --> 33:41.424
I was never going to kill you, Alexei.

33:41.425 --> 33:43.426
After all,

33:43.427 --> 33:46.863
I am my father's son, aren't I?

33:52.086 --> 33:55.105
You made one mistake, Charles.

33:55.106 --> 33:57.207
All the information you've got is right here

33:57.208 --> 33:59.142
in your father's little cabin in the woods.

33:59.143 --> 34:00.310
And outside that door,

34:00.311 --> 34:03.680
I have dozens of heavily-armed men.

34:03.681 --> 34:05.682
If I don't walk out of here,

34:05.683 --> 34:08.485
they're gonna come in for me.

34:08.485 --> 34:12.022
You're gonna need an army
to get out of here alive.

34:26.587 --> 34:28.972
Will they suffice?

34:37.414 --> 34:39.232
Arrest him.

34:43.270 --> 34:45.789
I just received word from Frost and Walker.

34:45.790 --> 34:47.123
They're en route to Burbank.

34:47.123 --> 34:50.560
It was a good plan, Agent Bartowski.

34:50.561 --> 34:52.245
Thank you, General.

34:53.230 --> 34:55.898
Tell your mom to come visit.

34:57.150 --> 34:59.202
It's been fun.

35:01.989 --> 35:04.174
Chuck? Chuck?

35:04.175 --> 35:05.542
Excuse me, guys.

35:05.543 --> 35:07.911
No, you first.

35:07.912 --> 35:09.996
As you were. At ease... gentlemen.

35:09.997 --> 35:12.382
We have to get out of here right now.

35:12.383 --> 35:13.583
What's up, buddy? Is everything okay?

35:13.584 --> 35:15.001
Just got a call from the hospital.

35:15.002 --> 35:17.220
Ellie's having her baby now.

35:17.221 --> 35:18.388
What?

35:18.389 --> 35:19.856
Oh. Oh, hey. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:19.857 --> 35:21.725
Uh, General, General, can we borrow a van?

35:21.726 --> 35:25.228
Agent Bartowski,
you just arrested Alexei Volkoff

35:25.229 --> 35:27.530
and obtained the Hydra Network
we have spent the last

35:27.531 --> 35:29.432
20 years searching for.

35:29.433 --> 35:32.185
Lieutenant, get this man a chopper.

35:32.186 --> 35:34.437
Thanks.

35:39.084 --> 35:41.452
You're dilated to ten and
fully effaced, Dr. Woodcomb.

35:41.453 --> 35:43.854
The contractions are two minutes apart.
The baby's coming.

35:43.855 --> 35:46.257
Can you get the doctor?

35:46.258 --> 35:47.792
Babe?

35:49.661 --> 35:50.861
Honey, look at me.

35:52.347 --> 35:54.365
I need you to go outside

35:54.366 --> 35:56.000
and take five minutes for yourself,

35:56.001 --> 35:58.602
pull yourself together and
then come back to me, okay?

35:58.603 --> 36:01.305
You're all I have right now, Devon.

36:01.306 --> 36:02.673
I need you.

36:13.035 --> 36:15.069
Ew, pregnant women.

36:15.070 --> 36:17.838
Ooh, pregnant women.

36:20.191 --> 36:22.827
Excuse me, candy striper?

36:22.828 --> 36:24.912
Hi. Listen,

36:24.913 --> 36:27.832
could you point us in the
direction of the Woodcomb womb?

36:27.833 --> 36:29.500
What? Without us,

36:29.501 --> 36:31.202
that kid is gonna grow up listening

36:31.203 --> 36:33.337
to Snow Patrol and... Coldplay.

36:34.673 --> 36:36.574
And we just can't have that, can we? So...

36:36.575 --> 36:38.759
I'm sorry, but no one goes in there

36:38.760 --> 36:40.177
unless they're a family member.

36:40.178 --> 36:42.897
So I suggest that you take a seat.

36:42.898 --> 36:44.682
Dr. Adler,

36:44.683 --> 36:46.984
Room 315, please.

37:02.167 --> 37:03.667
Hey, Awesome?

37:03.668 --> 37:05.336
Heard Ellie's in labor.

37:05.337 --> 37:07.871
Where is she?

37:09.808 --> 37:12.142
Why aren't you in there?

37:14.679 --> 37:17.715
Oh, listen, don't make
the same mistake I did.

37:17.716 --> 37:19.750
I missed my daughter's birth,

37:19.751 --> 37:22.119
missed her whole damn childhood.

37:22.120 --> 37:25.889
Alex's mom had to raise her all on her own.

37:28.060 --> 37:31.095
There's not a day that goes
by I don't regret that.

37:32.864 --> 37:34.999
Now you get in there.

37:35.000 --> 37:38.402
Move it.

38:00.592 --> 38:02.159
It's time to push.

came here to do, Jeffrey.

39:21.723 --> 39:23.841
Cover song by cover song,

39:23.842 --> 39:26.610
we are shaping the youth of America. Aah!

39:26.611 --> 39:29.597
I'm not allowed to do that anymore.

39:29.598 --> 39:31.815
Are you family?

39:31.816 --> 39:33.567
Yes.

39:33.568 --> 39:36.587
Okay. Well, only one of you can come in.

39:38.456 --> 39:39.823
Um, Mom.

39:39.824 --> 39:41.258
Mom, go ahead, please.

39:42.994 --> 39:45.429
Just make sure she knows
we're all out here, okay?

39:45.430 --> 39:48.749
I will.

39:53.672 --> 39:55.589
You came.

39:56.341 --> 39:58.475
We all did.

40:14.425 --> 40:16.477
I got it.

40:16.478 --> 40:18.562
Where'd Alex go? She went home.

40:18.563 --> 40:19.980
No, I didn't.

40:19.981 --> 40:22.099
I just went to get a coffee.

40:23.535 --> 40:27.538
Whether you like it or not,
Dad, I am not going anywhere.

40:28.740 --> 40:32.109
Neither am I.

40:32.110 --> 40:35.412
Good luck trying to get rid of me,
guys, 'cause...

40:35.413 --> 40:37.180
I like you guys.

40:38.383 --> 40:41.468
Your, your line is "I like you,
too, Morgan."

40:55.600 --> 40:57.284
Ellie, she's so beautiful.

40:59.904 --> 41:01.321
Congratulations.

41:02.107 --> 41:03.574
Thank you.

41:09.581 --> 41:12.082
Hello, my angel.

41:31.603 --> 41:32.903
