02:39.660 --> 02:41.140
Is anybody... 

02:43.490 --> 02:45.570
Is anybody there? 

03:14.760 --> 03:18.150
5 killings in one location.
This is considered manslaughter. 

03:18.150 --> 03:21.830
Lots of killings is good.
There's be that many more clues for us. 

03:21.830 --> 03:23.920
The murder weapon was already found at the scene. 

03:26.430 --> 03:29.980
This isn't even a long term case.
Why did they give it to us? 

03:29.980 --> 03:32.880
This is the first murder case since the new administrator took over. 

03:32.880 --> 03:34.880
Wouldn't the Director have more interest in this one? 

03:37.070 --> 03:39.260
You said there were survivors? 

03:39.260 --> 03:42.330
Well... there are survivors. 

03:42.330 --> 03:44.140
But there's also witnesses too. 

03:48.380 --> 03:50.780
The back door is blocked. 

03:51.490 --> 03:53.610
No other entrances... 

03:56.450 --> 04:00.880
Then, the ball had to have come from the front entrance. 

04:05.630 --> 04:10.700
Wow... how can they not have a single security camera around? 

04:33.960 --> 04:35.560
She's blind? 

04:35.560 --> 04:36.550
Yes. 

04:37.270 --> 04:38.290
How bad is it? 

04:38.290 --> 04:40.940
Visually handicapped, 1st degree. 

04:40.940 --> 04:42.630
She can't even feel light. 

04:42.630 --> 04:45.480
She had no idea what happened. 

04:45.480 --> 04:47.480
She was in the middle of recording. 

04:48.510 --> 04:49.740
Recording? 

04:49.740 --> 04:52.680
She was in the middle of recording an audition demo. 

04:52.680 --> 04:56.210
She was on stage the whole time during the 5 murders. 

04:57.980 --> 04:59.300
Give me a flashlight. 

05:06.910 --> 05:09.070
The only survivor. 

05:09.070 --> 05:11.910
Did they keep her alive because she couldn't be a witness anyway? 

05:14.350 --> 05:15.880
Or... 

05:15.880 --> 05:19.220
Director... that's a bit much... 

05:20.010 --> 05:22.010
What about the murder weapon? 

05:22.010 --> 05:23.650
They were strangled. 

05:23.650 --> 05:27.130
No criminal fingerprints,
only traces of the victims. 

05:27.130 --> 05:28.400
Where were they found? 

05:28.400 --> 05:29.810
Backstage. 

05:32.150 --> 05:34.650
I thought that woman was on stage the whole time. 

05:34.650 --> 05:37.680
That's true. But... 

05:39.740 --> 05:42.290
They left the evidence as is. 

05:43.170 --> 05:44.280
Interesting. 

05:44.970 --> 05:46.810
Who reported it first? 

05:46.810 --> 05:50.130
He's a singer here. He's on his way from the police station right now. 

06:09.420 --> 06:12.360
4:21, entered. 

06:14.910 --> 06:17.790
4:28, walked out. 

06:24.150 --> 06:27.180
Everyone dead but two. 

06:27.180 --> 06:32.390
One is blind, the other is in and out in 7 mins and reports the crime. 

06:32.390 --> 06:36.650
Beer boxes by the back door,
a security camera near the front door... 

06:36.650 --> 06:39.280
No other exits... 

06:40.040 --> 06:42.400
That leaves three possibilities. 

06:42.400 --> 06:44.110
The criminal is the blind woman. 

06:44.110 --> 06:47.170
Or the criminal is the one who reported the crime. 

06:47.170 --> 06:49.170
Or... 

06:54.160 --> 06:55.300
Mister! 

06:55.970 --> 06:57.300
Mister! 

06:57.790 --> 06:59.430
Mister! 

07:00.280 --> 07:02.760
Who are you? Police? 

07:02.760 --> 07:03.850
What? 

07:09.770 --> 07:11.950
- Wear the badge around.
- Yes. 

07:17.530 --> 07:18.740
Hey, you. 

07:18.740 --> 07:22.090
Lock the doors and make sure no one is allowed to leave. Got it? 

07:22.090 --> 07:23.440
Yes! 

07:26.980 --> 07:29.420
Everybody freeze! 

07:30.850 --> 07:33.860
We're going to do an inside search! 

07:33.860 --> 07:37.530
No one can leave and everyone must cooperate! Got it? 

07:37.530 --> 07:40.730
Inside search?
What does that mean? 

07:41.660 --> 07:44.080
It's a closed door investigation. 

07:44.080 --> 07:46.960
He's saying that the criminal could be hiding here among us. 

07:49.360 --> 07:52.770
Closed doors 

07:53.950 --> 07:55.720
Listen carefully! 

07:55.720 --> 07:57.580
Right side people!
Bathrooms, back door! 

07:57.580 --> 07:58.880
Center!
Stage, backstage! 

07:58.880 --> 08:01.420
Left side people!
Office, bar, dressing room! 

08:01.420 --> 08:02.050
Start! 

08:02.050 --> 08:03.280
Yes! 

08:03.280 --> 08:07.460
Make sure these hiding bastards don't escape! 

08:26.870 --> 08:29.540
Choi Dong Hyun, 27.
Waiter. 

08:31.980 --> 08:35.590
Kim Yoon Suk, 28.
Another waiter. 

08:36.929 --> 08:39.780
Kim Min Shik, 48.
Cafe owner. 

08:47.400 --> 08:50.860
Bang Jung Hoon, 41.
Head chef. 

08:52.650 --> 08:55.940
Finally, Choi Chul Gyu, 34.
Manager. 

08:57.190 --> 08:59.650
This is a bit strange. 

08:59.650 --> 09:02.330
I can't believe he got killed with a knife in his hand... 

09:02.330 --> 09:04.820
...with the criminal record and job he had. 

09:07.610 --> 09:09.620
He wielded the knife... 

09:11.760 --> 09:13.520
But it's clean. 

09:18.030 --> 09:19.830
No signs of struggle... 

09:22.620 --> 09:26.270
They were all strangled to death but this is the only trace of resistance. 

09:26.270 --> 09:27.590
But... 

09:27.590 --> 09:31.910
How did they not know the others were dead when they were all in the same place? 

09:31.910 --> 09:35.480
If someone even wielded a knife,
other people would've screamed. 

09:35.480 --> 09:37.020
Was it because of the music? 

09:38.380 --> 09:40.050
What if they were already dead? 

09:41.080 --> 09:45.840
If someone wanted to kill 5 people at once, they must've had a plan. 

09:45.840 --> 09:48.110
A plan with the lowest risk. 

09:49.490 --> 09:51.680
- Did they have an entry card?
- Yes. 

09:59.270 --> 10:02.530
The criminal was familiar with the setting. 

10:02.530 --> 10:06.040
Then, that leaves that woman and the man who reported. 

10:08.870 --> 10:13.190
It's possible to strangle 5 people within 7 minutes. 

10:15.890 --> 10:20.130
But how could a blind woman kill 5 people in a row? 

10:20.130 --> 10:23.070
In this case, domination is key. 

10:23.070 --> 10:25.860
From 2-4 PM. 

10:25.860 --> 10:27.490
In two 30 minute intervals. 

10:29.710 --> 10:31.640
But, work hours are pretty much set. 

10:31.640 --> 10:33.880
They knew the pattern well. 

10:33.880 --> 10:37.040
It would've been hard to kill all of them at the same time. 

10:37.040 --> 10:39.590
As soon as they got to work, they waited... 

10:39.590 --> 10:41.280
...to kill them one by one. 

10:41.280 --> 10:46.100
Then, the order of death matches the order of work clock in. 

11:00.370 --> 11:02.190
There's a wound near the ear. 

11:02.190 --> 11:03.690
His name is... 

11:04.350 --> 11:05.690
Kim Yoon Suk? 

11:06.230 --> 11:10.060
But seeing that it's healed,
he probably had this for a week. 

11:10.430 --> 11:12.940
It hasn't even been 30 minutes since the bodies arrived. 

11:12.940 --> 11:14.880
It's confusing keeping track of who's who. 

11:15.610 --> 11:17.580
But, the weird thing is... 

11:17.580 --> 11:19.610
He was strangled in the front. 

11:20.240 --> 11:22.280
Did the criminal want to see him die face to face? 

11:22.280 --> 11:24.550
The criminal couldn't satisfy his revenge by just killing. 

11:25.340 --> 11:26.730
There has to be something else. 

11:27.550 --> 11:29.130
Call me if you find anything. 

11:49.040 --> 11:51.270
He's not in here, I see. 

11:53.740 --> 11:56.000
That leaves 2 possibilities left. 

11:57.390 --> 12:00.670
The man who reported it to the police... Or... 

12:02.680 --> 12:05.070
The woman who waited for the police. 

12:13.190 --> 12:15.810
The recording was turned off at times. 

12:15.810 --> 12:17.690
What were you doing during the breaks? 

12:17.690 --> 12:21.240
I was just... on stage. 

12:21.240 --> 12:22.860
Continuously? 

12:23.730 --> 12:24.860
Yes. 

12:25.610 --> 12:28.700
This may sound strange but... 

12:28.700 --> 12:32.440
Moving around is not natural to a handicapped person. 

12:34.080 --> 12:35.530
But... 

12:35.530 --> 12:38.320
Who would do such a thing? 

12:39.440 --> 12:41.180
I'm not sure. 

12:41.950 --> 12:43.850
I'm curious as well. 

12:44.550 --> 12:47.620
You have beautiful eyes. 

12:47.620 --> 12:49.020
Really? 

12:54.690 --> 12:58.390
It doesn't sound like you think they're beautiful. 

13:01.350 --> 13:04.870
No, they're really pretty. 

13:04.870 --> 13:06.870
I wish you could see them. 

13:11.080 --> 13:13.590
There was someone I wanted to see. 

13:15.340 --> 13:17.410
That person used to say that too. 

13:17.410 --> 13:20.590
He wanted me to see my own face. 

13:20.590 --> 13:24.350
Do you live with anyone by any chance? 

13:25.960 --> 13:28.420
No. Why? 

13:29.130 --> 13:31.680
It looks like someone takes care of you. 

13:31.680 --> 13:33.430
Your nails look nice. 

13:34.390 --> 13:36.570
They said it was red. 

13:37.650 --> 13:39.730
But, I can't tell. 

13:39.730 --> 13:41.940
I lost that skill when I was two. 

13:45.000 --> 13:48.010
The color suits you. 

13:53.800 --> 13:55.560
Ah! Detective? 

13:56.810 --> 13:58.090
Yes. 

13:58.090 --> 14:00.010
I just remembered something. 

14:00.010 --> 14:03.680
This might not help but I remember hearing sounds that night. 

14:04.900 --> 14:06.520
What sounds. 

14:06.520 --> 14:09.070
I thought maybe I heard wrong... 

14:10.760 --> 14:13.940
The sound of footsteps. 

14:18.910 --> 14:22.510
Witness 

14:42.580 --> 14:43.820
<i>Boss? </i>

14:45.270 --> 14:46.820
<i>Eun Soo? </i>

14:48.510 --> 14:50.480
Play that louder. 

14:54.500 --> 14:56.050
<i>Eun Soo? </i>

14:57.590 --> 14:59.020
What time was that? 

15:00.030 --> 15:02.860
I'd say before 4:00 PM. 

15:02.860 --> 15:05.910
Park Eun Soo came in around 4:21 PM. 

15:06.710 --> 15:11.390
Then, it's likely those footsteps belonged to the criminal. 

15:11.390 --> 15:14.070
But, why did she think it was Park Eun Soo? 

15:15.410 --> 15:17.200
That's just because... 

15:17.200 --> 15:19.920
I thought the footsteps sounded like Eun Soo's. 

15:21.090 --> 15:24.380
Everyone's footsteps sound different. 

15:24.380 --> 15:27.730
The way they walk, their shoes...
Things like that. 

15:27.730 --> 15:32.810
Eun Soo's footsteps sound like boots. 

15:32.810 --> 15:34.780
It has a specific sound. 

15:34.780 --> 15:36.440
Boots? 

15:38.930 --> 15:41.350
The person who reported is here! 

15:44.700 --> 15:46.050
Sounds... 

15:47.000 --> 15:49.380
I'd be listening for the sound. 

15:54.430 --> 15:58.700
I don't know who but whoever he was, he should've killed her too. 

16:01.900 --> 16:03.500
That's fine. 

16:03.500 --> 16:06.460
Let's hear what you did for 7 minutes real time. 

16:06.460 --> 16:08.750
No sugarcoating. 

16:17.890 --> 16:22.310
Well, there was nothing different about that day. 

16:22.310 --> 16:27.160
I went straight to the bathroom as soon as I got in. 

16:29.790 --> 16:34.540
But, the bathroom was so dirty. 

16:34.540 --> 16:38.690
I thought I should clean it during that time. 

16:40.190 --> 16:42.310
But it was strange. 

16:42.310 --> 16:44.510
That feeling. 

16:44.510 --> 16:46.570
I didn't see anybody around. 

16:47.410 --> 16:50.370
The kids should've been preparing to open. 

17:04.210 --> 17:06.970
Is anybody here?! 

17:08.690 --> 17:10.480
Chul Gyu! 

17:12.690 --> 17:17.200
When I saw the knife, I was wondering what was going on! 

17:17.200 --> 17:19.970
So I decided to report it first. 

17:22.050 --> 17:23.300
What about Song Hwa Young? 

17:23.300 --> 17:27.480
I told you she was just singing casually. 

17:27.480 --> 17:31.280
Why didn't you protect your colleague in that dangerous situation? 

17:31.280 --> 17:34.480
Why would I?
I was more scared! 

17:34.480 --> 17:36.380
What's so scary about a woman who can't see? 

17:36.380 --> 17:42.810
Everyone else is dead and there she was singing by herself... 

17:42.810 --> 17:44.620
Is that not scary to you? 

17:44.620 --> 17:46.620
Everyone else dead,
only she was alive? 

17:47.800 --> 17:51.060
How did you know they were all dead when you only saw 2? 

17:52.230 --> 17:53.550
Well that... 

17:55.170 --> 17:58.350
I found out from the police. 

18:06.270 --> 18:07.370
Why? 

18:12.600 --> 18:14.760
Give it back! 

18:17.270 --> 18:18.500
What's wrong with your eye? 

18:18.500 --> 18:20.280
Give it back! 

18:22.720 --> 18:25.960
I told you to be straightforward and now what is this? 

18:33.940 --> 18:40.520
The Boss told Eun Soo to quit. 

18:40.520 --> 18:41.360
Why? 

18:42.240 --> 18:43.360
That... 

18:46.220 --> 18:48.370
It's all because of me. 

18:50.250 --> 18:55.930
Eun Soo wanted something from me. 

18:59.670 --> 19:01.030
Like what? 

19:02.100 --> 19:03.540
At any time... 

19:05.170 --> 19:07.410
At any place... 

19:09.140 --> 19:11.370
He wanted me from time to time. 

19:12.710 --> 19:16.540
I was afraid others would find out so I hid it. 

19:17.770 --> 19:20.360
That awful lotion smell... 

19:22.400 --> 19:24.970
It was so terrible but... 

19:27.200 --> 19:30.090
I had no choice but to keep it to myself. 

19:31.020 --> 19:35.820
Every time someone touched me,
I wanted to die. 

19:36.690 --> 19:39.950
You should've told the police. 

19:41.340 --> 19:43.020
But that day... 

19:44.020 --> 19:46.620
He made it possible for me to sing. 

19:52.580 --> 19:56.750
But later on, the Boss found out. 

19:59.240 --> 20:01.510
There was a big fight. 

20:02.140 --> 20:03.700
They fought? 

20:05.560 --> 20:06.770
Yes. 

20:06.770 --> 20:08.910
I heard the fighting. 

20:09.690 --> 20:10.680
Very intensely. 

20:24.560 --> 20:26.960
Yes, I fought. 

20:26.960 --> 20:28.760
But, so what? 

20:28.760 --> 20:30.760
Who cares if you fought? 

20:30.760 --> 20:33.690
It's what you fought about that's illegal! 

20:33.690 --> 20:35.130
Illegal? 

20:36.040 --> 20:39.240
You sexually assaulted Song Hwa Young. 

20:39.240 --> 20:42.900
Just wait until we report it to the police. 

20:45.510 --> 20:51.480
Being known as a public sex offender is worse than going to prison. 

20:52.580 --> 20:56.450
This is driving me crazy! 

20:56.450 --> 20:58.450
What the hell! 

21:00.910 --> 21:02.320
Detective. 

21:03.120 --> 21:05.970
These people are scary people. 

21:06.730 --> 21:14.310
These kids have been working with the Boss since his nightclub days. 

21:14.900 --> 21:16.220
Hwa Young? 

21:16.220 --> 21:22.600
She's someone who would do anything to be a singer. 

21:22.680 --> 21:27.090
She seduced me a couple times to get up on stage. 

21:27.090 --> 21:30.710
I guess she told the Boss immediately right after! 

21:31.460 --> 21:39.090
Do you know what kind of things the Boss did to finalize the contract? 

21:39.090 --> 21:42.470
So, how is this illegal?! 

21:42.470 --> 21:44.520
I was taken advantage of too! 

21:56.020 --> 21:58.680
This carpet is like a science. 

22:04.070 --> 22:07.250
The carpet dents don't match up. 

22:07.250 --> 22:09.630
It looks like someone moved it. 

22:09.630 --> 22:13.600
But they wiped it clean.
There's nothing left. 

22:14.660 --> 22:17.110
There isn't nothing left. 

22:17.110 --> 22:19.120
There's traces of the wiping. 

22:19.120 --> 22:21.120
Then that means something happened here. 

22:22.080 --> 22:23.350
Min Ho. 

22:23.350 --> 22:25.990
What if everything stayed the same when the workers left? 

22:28.610 --> 22:32.220
If the door was unlocked and the box was moved to the side... 

22:33.060 --> 22:34.640
That means he broke in from the inside. 

22:34.640 --> 22:39.010
He broke in, committed the murder and then closed it again. 

22:39.010 --> 22:41.990
But how did he block the door with beer boxes from the outside? 

22:42.810 --> 22:45.130
Isn't that possible in 7 minutes? 

22:46.810 --> 22:50.080
I'm curious about his schedule for today. 

24:24.010 --> 24:26.820
Why are you doing this again? 

24:26.820 --> 24:30.080
If I killed them, would I report it? 

24:32.240 --> 24:33.910
I'm so speechless. 

24:33.910 --> 24:38.130
Bring the evidence, then suspect me! 

24:38.730 --> 24:40.330
It's raining outside. 

24:41.950 --> 24:43.780
But your shoes are clean. 

24:45.350 --> 24:46.930
You have a car, huh? 

24:47.840 --> 24:49.220
Car? 

24:49.220 --> 24:50.710
Why are you asking all of a sudden? 

24:50.710 --> 24:51.700
No, no. 

24:52.590 --> 24:56.310
I wanted to pay your parking fee since you're cooperating so well. 

25:06.110 --> 25:09.720
You parked in this underground parking lot at 11:38. 

25:11.060 --> 25:16.830
Even my dead grandma could get here in 5 minutes. 

25:17.910 --> 25:19.920
But, why did it take you 5 hours? 

25:28.720 --> 25:31.270
The stomach is clean and so is the blood. 

25:31.820 --> 25:35.970
But, there were slight burn marks near the back of his neck. 

25:39.140 --> 25:40.740
He was tasered. 

25:41.780 --> 25:43.640
Same for everybody else. 

25:43.640 --> 25:45.440
<i>We're lucky we found this out. </i>

25:45.440 --> 25:49.310
There's not enough. There has to be another murder weapon. 

25:51.020 --> 25:52.100
Fear. 

25:52.920 --> 25:56.620
Facing the criminal holding the taser even with a knife in your hand... 

25:57.330 --> 25:58.620
That kind of fear. 

26:20.640 --> 26:23.150
If you were at the motel at 4:09... 

26:25.910 --> 26:28.010
Park Eun Soo is telling the truth. 

26:28.790 --> 26:31.990
Those boxes could've been there for a while. 

26:31.990 --> 26:34.580
It's also not certain that the door was opened today. 

26:34.580 --> 26:36.050
No. 

26:36.050 --> 26:39.260
Those marks were definitely made today. 

26:39.260 --> 26:40.900
Keep up the good work. 

26:44.770 --> 26:49.090
Something is fishy with that bastard but I don't know what. 

26:49.090 --> 26:51.950
Song Hwa Young is left. 

26:57.420 --> 26:59.840
She mentioned footsteps.. 

27:01.850 --> 27:04.860
I feel like we're being played by her game. 

27:07.650 --> 27:11.710
There's a flower blooming among the dead bodies making this confusing. 

27:22.000 --> 27:25.900
Corpse Flower 

27:46.840 --> 27:48.270
What exactly... 

27:48.270 --> 27:51.370
A taser that was used to control the victims. 

27:52.290 --> 27:56.510
That was licensed under Song Hwa Young's name for self defense. 

27:56.510 --> 27:59.410
The murder weapon was licensed by the police. 

28:00.140 --> 28:01.850
Was that before the case? 

28:03.520 --> 28:05.160
That's too careless. 

28:05.160 --> 28:07.710
It's too careless for me to believe. 

28:07.710 --> 28:11.500
Looks like there was a motive behind this careless act. 

28:12.490 --> 28:15.260
So accurate that it looks careless... 

28:15.260 --> 28:18.090
Song Hwa Young is hiding behind her handicap. 

28:18.090 --> 28:21.940
We've been underestimating her because of it. 

28:22.610 --> 28:26.330
Without proper evidence,
we can't prosecute her and she won't confess. 

28:27.450 --> 28:30.130
We need to reveal her true self. 

28:30.130 --> 28:33.870
We need to read deeper into those eyes that can't see anything. 

28:35.040 --> 28:37.010
If she's hiding something... 

28:40.710 --> 28:41.870
Fought? 

28:41.870 --> 28:47.450
<i>Yes, they submitted a demo and proposed a slave contract... </i>

28:47.450 --> 28:51.110
<i>They said that if we didn't agree to the terms, they wouldn't do it. </i>

28:51.110 --> 28:52.990
<i>They came to our office and started a ruckus. </i>

28:54.310 --> 28:57.180
First, Park Eun Soo. 

28:57.180 --> 28:59.750
Now, the Boss's woman... 

29:01.590 --> 29:05.340
First, sexual harassment... 

29:05.340 --> 29:08.300
Now, a slave contract... 

29:32.430 --> 29:36.640
I guess she didn't want to share dressing rooms. 

30:54.920 --> 30:56.390
What's going on? 

30:56.390 --> 30:58.830
Customers keep coming in. 

31:01.040 --> 31:02.440
They must have good business. 

31:12.430 --> 31:13.990
Eun Jung? 

31:14.760 --> 31:16.540
I need some bank records. 

31:21.320 --> 31:22.900
What are you doing here? 

31:23.890 --> 31:25.510
I was looking for that. 

31:31.650 --> 31:35.240
It's all the same brand. 

31:35.240 --> 31:38.420
We found those lotions in the office a while ago. 

31:38.420 --> 31:40.090
But, they were inside a drawer. 

31:43.740 --> 31:46.830
There was another one on top of the desk. 

31:46.830 --> 31:49.360
So I didn't think much of it. 

31:50.180 --> 31:53.530
But later on, I saw one in the kitchen cabinet. 

31:53.530 --> 31:55.530
And another one in the drawer. 

32:05.860 --> 32:07.650
All the staff members... 

32:08.800 --> 32:10.940
...use the same lotion? 

32:11.810 --> 32:14.100
But the weird thing is... 

32:15.030 --> 32:17.010
Why would they be hidden? 

32:17.010 --> 32:19.010
They can just leave it outside. 

32:20.930 --> 32:23.540
I thought I wouldn't find it here... 

32:23.540 --> 32:24.910
But it's right there. 

32:34.360 --> 32:37.620
Someone threw it and broke it? 

32:38.830 --> 32:40.090
Sorry. 

32:55.220 --> 32:59.030
Was there a reason why the employees all used the same lotion? 

33:01.320 --> 33:03.630
While secretly hiding it? 

33:05.300 --> 33:09.950
Song Hwa Young said that Eun Soo would molest her from time to time. 

33:09.950 --> 33:12.200
Enough for her to hate his scent. 

33:14.530 --> 33:18.310
If all the employees smelled like Park Eun Soo... 

33:20.110 --> 33:21.580
Then what? 

33:21.580 --> 33:24.890
Does that mean Song Hwa Young was molested by more than one person? 

33:24.890 --> 33:30.380
Song Hwa Young's dressing room has blinds installed from the outside. 

33:31.310 --> 33:34.190
The terrible abuse... 

33:34.900 --> 33:36.930
The terrible revenge... 

33:47.680 --> 33:49.040
Eun Soo? 

33:51.590 --> 33:54.160
Everyone wore this lotion that day. 

33:59.900 --> 34:03.760
You seem to think I'm Eun Soo, even thought I'm not wearing boots. 

34:04.800 --> 34:06.550
Sorry. 

34:06.550 --> 34:08.219
I must've been imagining things. 

34:08.219 --> 34:09.820
You were sure. 

34:09.820 --> 34:13.469
You already knew that we weren't able to sense other's footsteps. 

34:14.250 --> 34:15.699
I'm sorry. 

34:16.330 --> 34:19.610
I just had a feeling...
I must've heard wrong. 

34:21.620 --> 34:25.360
Did you know that Park Eun Soo walked around this entire cafe? 

34:27.230 --> 34:29.040
What are you saying? 

34:29.040 --> 34:32.070
I only recognize his scent. 

34:32.929 --> 34:35.050
Where is your taser? 

34:38.840 --> 34:40.370
My taser? 

34:40.370 --> 34:43.480
The one you reported to the police a week ago. 

34:47.880 --> 34:50.020
It's at home. 

34:53.150 --> 34:54.880
Send a patrol car. 

35:04.910 --> 35:07.310
They're all happy songs. 

35:08.220 --> 35:11.340
But the mood totally changed. 

35:12.420 --> 35:15.270
She was singing sad love songs. 

35:15.270 --> 35:19.440
She must've changed her repertoire. Singers do that. 

35:19.440 --> 35:22.540
But she changed her entire style. 

35:23.590 --> 35:26.450
Like a completely different person... 

35:32.370 --> 35:34.280
That nail art... 

35:35.700 --> 35:40.610
But seeing that she still has a habit of biting her nails... 

35:40.610 --> 35:42.610
It hasn't been that long. 

35:44.110 --> 35:48.830
There were recent changes in her emotions, her feelings. 

35:50.250 --> 35:52.850
There was someone I wanted to see. 

35:55.470 --> 35:57.690
That person used to say that too. 

35:58.930 --> 36:01.870
He wanted me to see my own face. 

36:03.920 --> 36:05.350
Love? 

36:06.520 --> 36:07.960
With who? 

36:09.760 --> 36:11.770
I don't know. 

36:11.770 --> 36:16.070
It doesn't seem like it was just an ordinary love. 

36:16.070 --> 36:18.040
This was just 10 days ago. 

36:18.040 --> 36:21.300
Just before planning out the crime... 

36:35.040 --> 36:38.490
There were no tasers at your house. 

36:38.490 --> 36:40.490
There's no way... 

36:40.490 --> 36:42.970
Then, how about the drawers? 

36:42.970 --> 36:45.690
Whatever you had in your house... 

36:45.690 --> 36:50.710
...were things for your sex life between you and the Boss. 

36:53.540 --> 36:57.020
What does that have to do with this case? 

36:57.020 --> 36:58.360
You tell me 

36:59.300 --> 37:01.170
what it has to do with the case. 

37:01.930 --> 37:04.180
Why did you sent us over there?

37:05.460 --> 37:07.450
It's not me! 

37:08.400 --> 37:11.550
How could a blind idiot like me? 

37:11.550 --> 37:14.650
How could I kill someone?
How?! 

37:22.890 --> 37:25.260
Did Song Hwa Young really kill them? 

37:26.950 --> 37:29.160
In one specific location... 

37:29.160 --> 37:31.950
...multiple murders committed... 

37:33.850 --> 37:36.460
The motive is clear. 

37:37.110 --> 37:39.820
Revenge, punishment... 

37:41.160 --> 37:44.830
Other people would've used a knife, a baseball bat... 

37:44.830 --> 37:47.210
...an ax, a shotgun. 

37:47.210 --> 37:48.660
Why? 

37:50.890 --> 37:52.750
To release their anger. 

37:54.040 --> 37:57.280
But, this case involves tasering and strangling. 

37:58.080 --> 37:59.900
Very tedious and complicated. 

37:59.900 --> 38:01.670
Why did she do it? 

38:01.670 --> 38:04.850
First off, she needed it to control them. 

38:04.850 --> 38:07.010
She couldn't have them bleeding. 

38:07.530 --> 38:09.310
That's the second reason. 

38:10.370 --> 38:14.730
She wouldn't know where to wipe the blood off anyway. 

38:15.360 --> 38:18.710
So, where is the taser? 

38:19.950 --> 38:21.720
It's not where... 

38:21.720 --> 38:24.180
It's why she sent us to her house that's important. 

38:24.850 --> 38:27.280
Park Eun Soo should have the answers. 

38:30.480 --> 38:31.790
Bring him in. 

38:32.100 --> 38:32.980
Yes. 

38:37.260 --> 38:41.830
Kicking me out, calling me in.
How annoying! 

38:42.430 --> 38:43.800
What now?! 

38:46.220 --> 38:49.660
I want to hear why everyone likes this lotion so much. 

38:51.020 --> 38:54.170
Your fingerprints are on here so don't try anything funny. 

38:58.000 --> 39:00.720
I only used it once after washing my face. 

39:01.890 --> 39:04.590
Song Hwa Young said it was yours. 

39:05.240 --> 39:09.140
What?! That crazy -  

39:12.310 --> 39:14.450
You might not go home today. 

39:19.340 --> 39:22.110
Well... the Boss... 

39:22.110 --> 39:27.930
...said he'd introduce her to a management company... 

39:27.930 --> 39:30.090
She said she wanted to work there. 

39:36.970 --> 39:39.710
What a sexy body... 

39:39.710 --> 39:42.890
She probably doesn't know what a sexy body she has. Huh? 

39:43.730 --> 39:46.000
Maybe because she used to massage... 

39:46.000 --> 39:47.770
She's different. 

39:47.770 --> 39:49.440
What's different? 

39:49.440 --> 39:51.710
Already? 

39:51.710 --> 39:53.710
Not yet, you punk. 

39:56.400 --> 40:01.130
I found out what they were doing that day for the first time. 

40:03.150 --> 40:07.390
One day, I saw these bastards... 

40:07.390 --> 40:09.980
Jesus... 

40:12.730 --> 40:16.940
I saw them taking turns sexually assaulting her. 

40:16.940 --> 40:20.290
I couldn't believe it. 

40:20.290 --> 40:25.590
I saw the kind of games those guys were playing with her. 

40:25.590 --> 40:28.380
They were wearing that lotion. 

40:31.430 --> 40:36.060
After that... well...
Everyone. 

40:37.550 --> 40:40.020
So, the lotion isn't yours? 

40:40.020 --> 40:41.850
Of course not! 

40:41.850 --> 40:46.950
I don't know what she's been saying about me. 

40:46.950 --> 40:49.270
But, this really isn't mine! 

40:50.010 --> 40:51.670
Then whose is it? 

40:54.290 --> 40:55.540
Well... 

41:02.140 --> 41:03.860
We found another suspect. 

41:13.310 --> 41:17.180
These are bank records but there's one guy without an employee card. 

41:18.180 --> 41:19.600
Kang Jin Wook? 

41:21.490 --> 41:25.290
The club was too busy to only have 2 waiters. 

41:25.290 --> 41:28.820
There's another guy who gets paid less. 

41:29.750 --> 41:31.670
Probably a part time worker. 

41:32.750 --> 41:35.460
He was probably in an intimate relationship with Hwa Young. 

41:36.840 --> 41:39.460
If this is the love that Detective Nam was talking about... 

41:40.250 --> 41:43.500
He probably did some "cleaning" for the woman he loved. 

41:44.470 --> 41:48.450
Then, the person who came in through the back door was... 

41:48.450 --> 41:49.660
Kang Jin Wook? 

41:54.870 --> 41:57.120
Yes, Kang Jin Wook! 

41:57.120 --> 41:59.120
He was a part time worker here. 

41:59.120 --> 42:01.510
That lotion was his. 

42:01.510 --> 42:06.270
Yoon Suk used to tell me that those two were close. 

42:07.760 --> 42:11.110
Dead Yoon Suk. He was like Satan! 

42:11.110 --> 42:18.240
He would put on Jin Wook's lotion and play with her. 

42:19.090 --> 42:21.660
That bastard started this whole thing! 

42:22.660 --> 42:27.610
One day, he caught on. 

42:27.610 --> 42:32.060
The guys would constantly tease her. 

42:32.060 --> 42:35.260
Then, he really found out the truth. 

42:35.980 --> 42:41.380
Who wouldn't go crazy if they found out that the Boss and... 

42:41.380 --> 42:45.900
...his employees were using his lotion to play with his girl? 

42:49.360 --> 42:52.020
Why didn't you speak up earlier? 

42:52.020 --> 42:54.070
We could've wrapped this up! 

42:54.070 --> 42:55.690
Sorry. 

42:55.690 --> 42:59.540
I thought you would misinterpret my relationship with Hwa Young. 

42:59.540 --> 43:01.810
It really wasn't like that. 

43:01.810 --> 43:04.600
Song Hwa Young has been calling you out for a reason. 

43:06.720 --> 43:10.360
After this case closes, you're up next. 

43:22.360 --> 43:23.830
I... 

43:25.970 --> 43:27.500
...killed them. 

43:39.280 --> 43:40.630
I... 

43:42.070 --> 43:43.800
...killed them! 

43:47.390 --> 43:50.400
I said I killed them! 

43:53.690 --> 43:57.320
Blind Canary 

44:09.660 --> 44:11.570
Who did you kill next? 

44:17.970 --> 44:19.670
The head chef. 

44:20.470 --> 44:21.990
That's not the kitchen. 

44:23.890 --> 44:29.340
Sorry. I'm a bit out of it. 

44:32.130 --> 44:33.900
Where did you go next? 

44:35.440 --> 44:37.750
After I killed the chef... 

44:39.830 --> 44:42.400
I washed my hands. 

44:42.400 --> 44:43.760
Why? 

44:46.510 --> 44:48.350
In case there was blood. 

44:52.200 --> 44:53.860
No, wait. 

44:53.860 --> 44:56.190
Did I say blood? 

44:56.190 --> 44:57.710
Not that... 

44:59.160 --> 45:01.800
Whatever it was... 

45:02.530 --> 45:04.630
Director, give it a rest. 

45:10.750 --> 45:12.350
I'm sorry. 

45:13.130 --> 45:16.090
I can't remember. 

45:17.900 --> 45:19.790
I'm stupid. 

45:21.000 --> 45:23.120
I lack a lot of things. 

45:24.280 --> 45:28.370
I'm very sorry. 

45:48.110 --> 45:50.030
This is broken. 

45:52.670 --> 45:53.900
Who's there? 

45:54.530 --> 45:56.690
Put the light away. 

45:58.470 --> 46:00.430
When did this go out? 

46:01.620 --> 46:04.460
Are you an electrician? 

46:04.460 --> 46:08.180
So you're saying that a murderer was living here? 

46:09.280 --> 46:11.770
When was the last time you saw the person who lived here? 

46:12.890 --> 46:16.440
I don't know!
There's too many people. 

46:16.440 --> 46:20.030
I don't know who lives where. 

46:20.690 --> 46:24.310
It's true that a Kang Jin Wook lived in Room 211. 

46:24.310 --> 46:26.510
But I've never seen his face. 

46:26.510 --> 46:32.610
For someone who ran away,
he didn't take much of his things. 

46:35.610 --> 46:38.280
What a scaredy cat. 

46:42.620 --> 46:43.980
Hey, you. 

46:43.980 --> 46:45.220
Yes? 

46:50.620 --> 46:52.350
Do I still look like a cop? 

46:55.680 --> 46:57.340
You scared me! 

47:04.220 --> 47:06.770
We received a report on Kang Jin Wook. 

47:06.770 --> 47:08.200
What report? 

47:08.870 --> 47:12.130
The victim's family reported him for assault. 

47:12.130 --> 47:14.880
Victim? Who's that? 

47:34.560 --> 47:37.280
How could I not have seen these clues? 

47:43.990 --> 47:45.910
Who are you looking for? 

47:49.800 --> 47:51.180
Kang Jin Wook. 

47:53.990 --> 47:55.720
I had a dream. 

47:59.310 --> 48:01.990
I've been having dreams almost every day. 

48:01.990 --> 48:05.090
I can't see what color they are. 

48:05.090 --> 48:09.350
But I know it's not the same darkness I see everyday. 

48:11.920 --> 48:15.010
What color could it be? 

48:16.330 --> 48:17.540
Perhaps... 

48:18.690 --> 48:22.510
If love had a color,
it'd be that color. 

48:24.850 --> 48:28.160
What's your relation to Kang Jin Wook? 

48:30.320 --> 48:32.200
The person you wanted to see... 

48:33.090 --> 48:34.780
...is Kang Jin Wook? 

48:36.270 --> 48:37.870
One day... 

48:39.040 --> 48:41.070
As I got off stage... 

48:41.890 --> 48:44.050
I was so thirsty. 

48:44.870 --> 48:46.210
But... 

48:47.270 --> 48:53.610
Nobody could tell that I was thirsty. 

48:56.900 --> 49:01.090
Would you like a beer? 

49:04.380 --> 49:06.560
Thank you. 

49:08.140 --> 49:13.290
But then someone noticed how thirsty I was. 

49:16.440 --> 49:19.250
Whenever you get thirsty,
just hold out this glass. 

49:19.250 --> 49:22.300
Whenever. So I can tell. 

49:24.100 --> 49:26.340
Thank you. 

49:32.570 --> 49:35.170
That was the first time I ever felt that way. 

49:36.380 --> 49:41.700
The feeling of someone actually noticing me. 

49:42.600 --> 49:46.800
The feeling of someone watching over me. 

49:47.710 --> 49:51.360
He didn't do it for himself. 

49:53.590 --> 49:56.030
Everything that happened to you... 

49:57.800 --> 50:00.070
We already know. 

50:01.670 --> 50:03.210
But... 

50:06.300 --> 50:09.000
How did you not know? 

50:09.480 --> 50:11.640
Even if it was the same lotion... 

50:12.310 --> 50:19.470
Because I'm the idiot who can't see the person I love. 

50:24.850 --> 50:31.080
Anyone can become blind when they fall for someone. 

50:32.600 --> 50:33.800
Anyone. 

50:40.980 --> 50:44.160
Where is Kim Yoon Suk? 

50:44.160 --> 50:46.160
Which one is he? 

50:57.940 --> 51:00.400
We have a problem here. 

51:03.130 --> 51:07.320
The boxes couldn't have been moved without Song Hwa Young's help. 

51:08.320 --> 51:09.790
Are they both accomplices? 

51:11.260 --> 51:14.850
Every clue is leading towards Song Hwa Young. 

51:15.600 --> 51:18.500
Kang Jin Wook is hiding behind Song Hwa Young's handicap. 

51:20.770 --> 51:24.060
If Kang Jin Wook used his lover's handicap... 

51:24.990 --> 51:27.820
Do you think he used Song Hwa Young? 

51:28.830 --> 51:30.280
The suspect has arrived. 

51:42.570 --> 51:43.770
Kang Jin Wook? 

51:44.880 --> 51:46.670
This bastard isn't Kang Jin Wook. 

51:47.690 --> 51:49.350
This bastard is Kim Yoon Suk. 

52:02.730 --> 52:06.360
Elegy 

52:08.250 --> 52:11.520
He was hospitalized after Kang Jin Wook beat him up. 

52:14.090 --> 52:19.520
Kang Jin Wook was afraid those guys would do it again. 

52:19.520 --> 52:23.630
So, he went instead of Kim Yoon Suk to protect her from them. 

52:23.630 --> 52:27.370
So, the person dead isn't Kim Yoon Suk. 

52:28.730 --> 52:30.460
Kang Jin Wook? 

52:30.460 --> 52:33.550
She killed the man she loved. 

52:33.550 --> 52:37.160
No way... Song Hwa Young did this all... 

52:37.160 --> 52:39.300
This is the end of the investigation. 

52:39.300 --> 52:41.480
But how is that possible? 

52:41.480 --> 52:43.000
Without any help? 

53:00.560 --> 53:01.940
What are you doing? 

53:04.660 --> 53:07.450
He pulled out the knife to defend himself. 

53:08.670 --> 53:10.780
But why didn't he run for the door instead of the corner? 

53:12.210 --> 53:14.140
The exit is that way. 

53:16.900 --> 53:18.700
Did the crime team leave? 

53:22.070 --> 53:23.740
What is this? 

53:30.140 --> 53:31.730
He lost his direction. 

53:57.470 --> 53:59.840
She just pretended to move the beer box. 

54:01.790 --> 54:04.230
But why blame it on Kang Jin Wook? 

54:16.860 --> 54:18.830
Where is Song Hwa Young? 

54:18.830 --> 54:20.690
I told her to get some rest. 

54:53.430 --> 54:55.090
Are you sure she's blind? 

54:55.960 --> 54:58.440
It looks like she can see everything. 

55:01.360 --> 55:03.370
It's kind of creepy. 

55:08.000 --> 55:10.010
A blind person may be weak in the daylight... 

55:11.000 --> 55:13.190
But we're the weak ones in the dark. 

55:16.150 --> 55:18.720
We were the ones too blind to see that. 

57:21.820 --> 57:24.350
What the hell? 

57:32.310 --> 57:34.830
The taser that was used in the dark. 

57:41.020 --> 57:44.700
If you put enough pressure on the neck for 2-3 mins, they die. 

58:20.910 --> 58:25.300
Next was the Manager, who was the only difficult one to kill. 

59:02.510 --> 59:05.840
Choi Chul Gyu couldn't win even with the knife. 

59:05.840 --> 59:09.060
Because there was something more terrifying than the taser. 

59:09.800 --> 59:11.870
Darkness becomes our handicap. 

59:13.020 --> 59:14.360
Because it's our fear. 

59:14.360 --> 59:17.480
Why did Song Hwa Young stay after the crime? 

59:19.290 --> 59:21.710
She had a reason to. 

59:22.920 --> 59:27.400
After making Park Eun Soo a suspect, she stayed to make sure all the evidence pointed to him. 

59:28.630 --> 59:32.010
After that, she lead all the evidence toward her revenge. 

59:33.220 --> 59:35.010
Not as a victim... 

59:35.010 --> 59:37.010
She hid herself as a suspect. 

59:37.240 --> 59:41.260
A suspect that could never be the criminal. 

59:42.580 --> 59:44.680
What about the beer boxes? 

59:44.680 --> 59:46.680
There were traces of someone breaking in... 

59:47.400 --> 59:51.960
Not breaking in... but traces of someone making it look that way. 

59:51.960 --> 59:54.280
Song Hwa Young moved the boxes around. 

59:54.770 --> 59:59.060
And then put the dust on the floor and door handle. 

59:59.880 --> 01:00:03.600
That was made to look like Kang Jin Wook did it. 

01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:10.000
Turning the crime over to the man she loved while giving a false confession. 

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.190
Why did she lead the evidence towards Kang Jin Wook? 

01:00:14.190 --> 01:00:16.330
He was someone that she loved. 

01:00:16.330 --> 01:00:19.100
If Kang Jin Wook came back alive... 

01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:21.760
Our investigation would've went down the drain. 

01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:25.070
The moment Kang Jin Wook would've been proved innocent. 

01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:29.870
We would've had to look for the sound Song Hwa Young made. 

01:00:36.030 --> 01:00:38.950
We would've had to look for another suspect with boots. 

01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:41.040
What do we do now? 

01:00:52.890 --> 01:00:56.380
It's been revealed that Kang Jin Wook had no affiliation with this crime. 

01:00:58.370 --> 01:00:59.680
Kang Jin Wook... 

01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:08.100
...won't be able to see you.
From now on... 

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:12.980
How fortunate. 

01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:16.590
What is? 

01:01:16.590 --> 01:01:18.150
Because of me... 

01:01:18.910 --> 01:01:21.280
He's been hurt a lot. 

01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:23.490
That person... 

01:01:26.130 --> 01:01:28.420
He said that because of him... 

01:01:29.130 --> 01:01:31.550
I had to go through this. 

01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:34.520
He thinks it's his fault. 

01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:42.730
That this happened because we had to hide our love. 

01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:48.270
Because of me... 

01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:52.310
I hurt him. 

01:02:02.210 --> 01:02:03.750
Are you okay? 

01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:07.790
Don't fight because of me. 

01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:11.620
I'm really fine. 

01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:14.540
How can you be so stupid? 

01:02:15.530 --> 01:02:17.440
Even if you can't see... 

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:26.260
I really want to kill those bastards. 

01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:27.970
How... 

01:02:28.550 --> 01:02:31.150
How can you be fine? Huh?! 

01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:34.130
Sorry. 

01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:38.500
I'm really sorry. 

01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:41.740
How can I - 

01:02:48.190 --> 01:02:50.090
I feel like it's my fault that this happened. 

01:02:51.150 --> 01:02:52.700
It's so hard for me. 

01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:55.790
Take care of yourself. 

01:02:57.350 --> 01:02:59.260
I'm leaving now. 

01:03:16.030 --> 01:03:18.870
That's when I knew. 

01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:24.440
This person doesn't love me anymore. 

01:03:25.270 --> 01:03:27.750
He won't protect me anymore. 

01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:34.850
I gave him that lotion as a gift. 

01:03:34.850 --> 01:03:40.680
I was always curious about where he would be. 

01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:44.290
But in the end, that lotion... 

01:03:46.130 --> 01:03:49.700
...only caused that person pain. 

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:55.060
It worked out well. 

01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:01.180
If he was with me... 

01:04:03.150 --> 01:04:06.000
He would be hurting more. 

01:04:09.590 --> 01:04:11.000
It worked out. 

01:04:14.420 --> 01:04:15.890
So... 

01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:19.540
Whose footsteps were those? 

01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:22.200
We heard it together. 

01:04:23.890 --> 01:04:25.720
Did you not catch him yet? 

01:04:26.570 --> 01:04:29.720
That person is definitely the criminal. 

01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:32.490
But... 

01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:35.630
If it's not Jin Wook... 

01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:38.030
Then who? 

01:04:57.470 --> 01:04:59.430
Let's go. Don't say anything. 

01:05:00.170 --> 01:05:02.460
Just refill her beer mug. 

01:05:03.870 --> 01:05:05.140
Got it. 

01:05:58.530 --> 01:05:59.930
Because I... 

01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:05.490
...was drunk off of that lotion scent... 

01:06:07.970 --> 01:06:11.720
Did you not think I would recognize you? 

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:17.210
The feeling of knowing and having to accept it... 

01:06:18.290 --> 01:06:20.210
That sad feeling... 

01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:25.060
It helped me sing my songs. 

01:06:26.850 --> 01:06:28.280
I... 

01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:32.450
Can protect you. 

01:06:34.050 --> 01:06:36.040
Don't have a hard time... 

01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:39.040
Because of me anymore. 

01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:44.020
Even though I'm blind... 

01:06:46.230 --> 01:06:51.050
I'm not stupid. 

01:09:22.340 --> 01:09:25.000
What a sad eye contact that must've been. 

01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:59.270
The taser was found inside Song Hwa Young's speakers. 

01:09:59.270 --> 01:10:01.820
We received her confession and the case has been closed. 

01:10:01.820 --> 01:10:04.310
We never heard her testimony. 

01:10:05.470 --> 01:10:07.760
Was it just for revenge? 

01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:13.520
She wanted to take away the guilt he felt for not protecting her. 

01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:17.990
To be free now. 

01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:39.980
Nam Yeh Ri. 

01:10:51.270 --> 01:10:52.830
Can you help me? 

01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:55.310
I need to get someone a gift. 

01:11:18.930 --> 01:11:22.900

01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:26.990
We found 10 infected people outside this villa. 

01:11:28.850 --> 01:11:32.050
They weren't injected. 

01:11:32.050 --> 01:11:34.410
The place of contact... here. 

01:11:37.780 --> 01:11:39.310
I want to send him to the hospital for real this time. 
You could die. 

01:11:42.410 --> 01:11:46.840
With every new suspect, should come a new infection... 

01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:48.680
Why is there none? 

01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:51.420
It's coming together slowly.
