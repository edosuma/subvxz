WEBVTT

00:02.054 --> 00:03.726
They fuckin' punch him,

00:03.756 --> 00:05.125
and stab him,

00:05.158 --> 00:07.692
and Rasputin's yelling,
I can't fucking die!

00:07.721 --> 00:09.666
I got two fucking dicks!

00:09.699 --> 00:11.135
W.C. Minor

00:11.169 --> 00:12.605
volunteers to help write

00:12.638 --> 00:14.576
the Oxford English Dictionary.

00:14.608 --> 00:17.780
This is what I was born to do!

00:19.684 --> 00:22.108
Space exploration has its roots

00:22.138 --> 00:26.104
in Jack Parsons' mumbling occult rituals

00:26.134 --> 00:30.704
while snorting blow off
of his friend's boobs.

00:44.095 --> 00:45.196
- Have you ever
- _

00:45.229 --> 00:46.866
been friends or known someone

00:46.900 --> 00:48.469
that you're like, Oh, this is, like,

00:48.503 --> 00:50.240
a real, like, fucking dangerous mind

00:50.273 --> 00:51.675
and I don't want to be around?

00:51.709 --> 00:53.512
Oh, yeah, I've dealt
with a Rasputin before.

00:53.545 --> 00:54.948
- You have dealt with a Rasputin?
- Yeah.

00:54.981 --> 00:56.149
I know girls like that where I'm like,

00:56.183 --> 00:57.479
I know how you get.

00:57.509 --> 01:00.189
Like, I don't want to
accidentally do crystal meth.

01:00.224 --> 01:01.159
- Right.
- Like, I just don't want

01:01.189 --> 01:02.126
- to accidentally do that.
- Yeah.

01:02.156 --> 01:03.862
To people that you... you think that

01:03.897 --> 01:05.233
you should trust, but
you really shouldn't.

01:05.266 --> 01:06.238
To you and me.

01:06.268 --> 01:07.268
Yes.

01:08.344 --> 01:09.344
Hello!

01:10.308 --> 01:12.846
Hello, everybody of the
Comedy Central world,

01:12.879 --> 01:14.283
my name's Chris Romano.

01:14.316 --> 01:16.286
And today, we're going
to be talking about

01:16.319 --> 01:18.756
the dangerous mind of Rasputin.

01:18.790 --> 01:19.759
Nostrovia.

01:19.793 --> 01:20.894
Nostrovia.

01:20.927 --> 01:22.631
The story of Rasputin.

01:22.664 --> 01:25.034
He leave his house at 23 and says,

01:25.069 --> 01:26.993
I got to wander the wilderness

01:27.023 --> 01:29.661
of Siberia in Russia.

01:29.693 --> 01:31.130
And at the time, I believe,

01:31.163 --> 01:32.833
that was called a... a strannik.

01:32.866 --> 01:33.867
A strank?

01:33.901 --> 01:35.604
A strannik was just a... is a...

01:35.637 --> 01:36.872
is a religious wanderer.

01:36.905 --> 01:38.609
So he became, like, a
strannik, and became...

01:38.643 --> 01:39.949
A strannik.

01:40.406 --> 01:41.782
Right.

01:42.160 --> 01:44.854
Exactly. He became a strannik.

01:44.887 --> 01:46.122
And so he...

01:46.157 --> 01:47.526
When he is out one night

01:47.559 --> 01:49.429
and he hears girls,

01:49.461 --> 01:50.630
like, playing outside,

01:50.663 --> 01:51.898
like girls laughing,

01:51.932 --> 01:53.035
like, real horny.

01:54.098 --> 01:55.673
Oh, fuck.

01:55.705 --> 01:56.774
Eh, oh fuck.

01:56.809 --> 01:58.044
So he sees three women

01:58.077 --> 01:59.813
skinny-dipping in the fucking pond

01:59.848 --> 02:01.738
and dives into the pond with them.

02:01.768 --> 02:03.538
Eventually, one thing leads to another,

02:03.572 --> 02:05.609
and he fucks each one of them.

02:07.378 --> 02:09.247
Has a great time.

02:09.281 --> 02:11.285
So Rasputin decides, he's like, look,

02:11.318 --> 02:12.755
I want to go to fucking St. Petersburg,

02:12.787 --> 02:14.223
'cause that's the capital of Russia.

02:14.257 --> 02:15.225
There's a fucking ton of women there,

02:15.258 --> 02:16.595
and I'm going to fuck

02:16.627 --> 02:17.930
until I get enlightened,

02:17.964 --> 02:20.076
until my fucking head explodes.

02:20.106 --> 02:21.370
He goes to St. Petersburg,

02:21.404 --> 02:23.306
and he's immediately
introduced to Tsar Nicholas.

02:23.340 --> 02:25.313
Course, he got a
beautiful, beautiful wife,

02:25.343 --> 02:26.779
Tsarina Alexandra,

02:26.813 --> 02:28.916
and their son, poor little Alexei.

02:28.950 --> 02:31.287
This little poor little
hemophiliac bastard

02:31.319 --> 02:32.442
who he can't even bump...

02:32.472 --> 02:33.540
if he bumps into a couch,

02:33.574 --> 02:34.542
he's gushin' blood.

02:34.576 --> 02:36.234
Right? That's embarrassing
for the family.

02:36.264 --> 02:37.548
It's kinda gross.

02:37.582 --> 02:39.619
Hey! Rasputin!

02:39.651 --> 02:41.922
Alexei's bleeding? Is
there anything you can do?

02:41.956 --> 02:43.192
Rasputin goes, Hey,

02:43.225 --> 02:44.627
relax, relax.

02:44.661 --> 02:46.831
He sits with Alexei for a little bit.

02:46.866 --> 02:48.435
Eventually, he stopped bleeding.

02:48.467 --> 02:49.435
He seems to be getting better.

02:49.469 --> 02:50.302
Then he's like, Holy shit,

02:50.332 --> 02:52.509
did you just cure fucking hemophilia?

02:52.542 --> 02:54.611
So, of course, the goddamn fucking...

02:54.645 --> 02:56.081
the tsar and the tsarina

02:56.115 --> 02:57.484
are super fucking happy.

02:57.516 --> 02:58.455
The czarina is like, Look,

02:58.485 --> 02:59.989
I gotta set you up with...

03:00.021 --> 03:02.025
with a fucking house and shit

03:02.058 --> 03:03.193
to fucking do this out of.

03:03.228 --> 03:04.195
Like, this is amazing.

03:04.229 --> 03:06.533
And it will be away from

03:06.567 --> 03:08.474
the rest of the fucking St. Petersburger

03:08.504 --> 03:10.675
aristocrat... aristocross...

03:10.708 --> 03:11.777
Aristocr...

03:11.810 --> 03:13.883
Aristocrocity.

03:13.913 --> 03:15.682
Aristo... aristocrate?

03:15.717 --> 03:16.987
Aristo...

03:17.020 --> 03:19.056
What's the fucking...

03:19.088 --> 03:20.893
Aristocrat, aristocrat-acy?

03:20.926 --> 03:24.231
Aristo...

03:24.264 --> 03:26.001
I need a fucking word.

03:26.036 --> 03:28.105
Aristo... the fucking
rich fucking pieces of shit

03:28.139 --> 03:30.209
that don't want you to do this.

03:30.242 --> 03:32.712
He... he starts having
these crazy fucking parties.

03:32.746 --> 03:34.049
He really, truly believes

03:34.082 --> 03:35.585
like, when I pull my dick out of here,

03:35.619 --> 03:36.753
you're going to see something

03:36.788 --> 03:37.989
you've never seen before.

03:38.022 --> 03:39.725
It's going to be enlighten.

03:39.759 --> 03:41.829
Um, my dick's full of hope.

03:41.862 --> 03:44.901
I call it the Obama Hope Syndrome.

03:48.108 --> 03:51.881
Also, FYI, no husbands allowed.

03:51.914 --> 03:55.754
This is a fucking BY-don't-B...
bring your fucking husbands.

03:57.959 --> 03:59.106
Should we get in the hot tub?

03:59.136 --> 04:01.102
- Sure.
- Oh, fuck, this hot tub

04:01.132 --> 04:03.770
feels real good on my... on everything.

04:05.639 --> 04:07.076
So, by 1916,

04:07.109 --> 04:09.346
everyone's soon slowly finding out

04:09.380 --> 04:10.392
like, Oh, these fucking parties

04:10.422 --> 04:12.449
aren't just to go fucking
drink and have fun.

04:12.479 --> 04:15.189
They're going in to fuck Rasputin.

04:15.224 --> 04:17.194
Finally, this guy, Felix,

04:17.226 --> 04:18.666
he's like, Here's what I'm going to do.

04:18.697 --> 04:21.702
I'm going to invite that
fucking prick Rasputin

04:21.733 --> 04:23.004
to fuck my wife.

04:23.038 --> 04:24.507
No way he's not going to fall for that.

04:24.539 --> 04:26.709
This fucking horny bastard loves cake.

04:26.743 --> 04:28.580
I'm going to fucking put some cyanide

04:28.613 --> 04:30.049
in his cake, and fucking let

04:30.084 --> 04:32.361
this fucking idiot eat... eat his death.

04:32.391 --> 04:33.690
I'll watch him fuck my wife

04:33.724 --> 04:34.892
and die at the same time.

04:34.924 --> 04:35.712
It'll be great.

04:35.742 --> 04:37.028
But also, the worst.

04:37.063 --> 04:38.633
So they feed him some cake.

04:38.663 --> 04:39.868
They watch him eat the cake.

04:39.901 --> 04:43.507
They sit back and go, Oh, he's dead.

04:43.541 --> 04:45.844
They look back at
him, two minutes later,

04:45.878 --> 04:48.015
he's finished the whole
fucking cake, not dead.

04:48.045 --> 04:49.518
They go, What the fuck is going on?

04:49.551 --> 04:51.721
That was a fucking
horse-load of fucking cyanide.

04:51.755 --> 04:54.193
- How the fuck is this guy not dead?
- Oh, wow.

04:54.226 --> 04:57.198
Besides pussy, this guy loves wine.

04:57.231 --> 04:58.934
We're going to dump some fuck cyanide

04:58.967 --> 05:00.102
in his wine.

05:00.137 --> 05:01.906
And they go, Hey, cheers!

05:01.940 --> 05:02.941
Let's fucking drink

05:02.976 --> 05:04.077
to fucking fucking my wife.

05:04.111 --> 05:05.647
Thanks so much for doing this.

05:05.681 --> 05:06.526
They look back at him,

05:06.556 --> 05:07.912
he's drinking all the fucking wine.

05:07.942 --> 05:10.556
He stands up, having
a fucking jovial time,

05:10.589 --> 05:11.314
and everybody's like,

05:11.344 --> 05:13.030
What the fuck is going on here?

05:13.060 --> 05:15.395
Why the fuck isn't this
piece of shit dying?

05:15.425 --> 05:16.934
And then they go, You
know what we need to do?

05:16.968 --> 05:18.905
Felix pulls out a revolver

05:18.937 --> 05:20.940
and fucking raises it,

05:20.974 --> 05:21.942
and shoots him in the back.

05:24.405 --> 05:27.352
Fuckin' Rasputin falls
down, and they go,

05:27.385 --> 05:28.587
He's fucking dead.

05:28.622 --> 05:29.891
Stay down here and party

05:29.923 --> 05:31.058
and fuck your own wife for once,

05:31.093 --> 05:32.237
you fucking asshole.

05:32.267 --> 05:34.698
They all go back, celebrating,

05:34.733 --> 05:36.435
Felix turns back
around, all of a sudden,

05:36.469 --> 05:37.939
he's fucking grabbed from behind,

05:37.971 --> 05:40.074
turns around and sees
that it's fucking Rasputin

05:40.108 --> 05:41.411
with his arms around his neck,

05:41.444 --> 05:42.714
choking him to death,

05:42.747 --> 05:43.949
and immediately starts freaking out,

05:43.983 --> 05:45.118
going I didn't fucking kill him!

05:45.151 --> 05:46.587
I didn't fucking kill him!

05:46.620 --> 05:47.621
And Rasputin's yelling,

05:47.656 --> 05:49.212
I can't fucking die!

05:49.242 --> 05:51.814
I got two fucking dicks!

05:52.098 --> 05:55.566
I got two fucking dicks.

05:55.596 --> 05:58.025
You can't kill a two-dicked man.

05:58.055 --> 05:59.439
You can't kill him.

06:00.362 --> 06:02.967
His cards come running to his aid,

06:02.999 --> 06:04.403
pull out their revolvers,

06:04.436 --> 06:06.941
and shoot Rasputin,

06:06.975 --> 06:09.082
each one time in the back.

06:09.112 --> 06:11.355
That makes it four shots in the back.

06:11.385 --> 06:13.905
He again rises and...

06:15.321 --> 06:17.326
They're like, This
motherfucker is crazy.

06:17.359 --> 06:19.105
They fucking beat him to death.

06:19.135 --> 06:22.502
They fucking punch him, and stab him,

06:22.535 --> 06:24.004
They get a carpet.

06:24.037 --> 06:25.473
They roll him up in the carpet.

06:25.506 --> 06:27.009
They take him to a bridge

06:27.042 --> 06:28.345
and dump him over the side

06:28.379 --> 06:30.018
into the fucking water.

06:30.048 --> 06:30.883
And then, morning,

06:30.917 --> 06:32.052
when his body washes up

06:32.085 --> 06:34.827
along the shore, frozen to death,

06:35.309 --> 06:38.128
they fucking finally realize,

06:38.390 --> 06:39.965
Wow.

06:40.275 --> 06:41.703
This is the first time

06:41.737 --> 06:43.191
I've ever thought that maybe,

06:43.221 --> 06:44.524
just maybe,

06:44.557 --> 06:46.528
that Rasputin is human.

06:46.562 --> 06:48.932
He's not a god that
we all thought he was.

06:48.966 --> 06:51.672
He's a human being, just
like every one of us.

06:53.623 --> 06:55.047
On the count of three.

06:55.077 --> 06:55.893
- Okay.
- Is there a way

06:55.923 --> 06:57.782
for your [bleep] to just...

06:57.815 --> 06:59.618
make its way out of your pants

06:59.651 --> 07:01.384
and we stand up on the count of three

07:01.414 --> 07:03.559
and we see your cock?

07:03.591 --> 07:04.378
I'll do it for you.

07:04.408 --> 07:05.271
Thank you.

07:05.301 --> 07:06.533
- On the count of three.
- Ready? One...

07:06.563 --> 07:07.990
- One. Two.
- Two.

07:08.020 --> 07:10.046
Three.

07:10.771 --> 07:12.571
- Cheers, Doug.
- Cheers.

07:17.078 --> 07:18.522
Hello. I'm Doug Jones,

07:18.552 --> 07:20.522
and today we're going
to talk about W.C. Minor,

07:20.555 --> 07:23.961
the most important man
behind the most important book

07:23.995 --> 07:25.565
in the English language.

07:25.598 --> 07:27.000
That... that's not what you wanted.

07:27.033 --> 07:28.069
No, but I love it.

07:28.103 --> 07:29.199
Okay.

07:29.229 --> 07:30.818
In 1863,

07:30.848 --> 07:34.146
W.C. Minor graduated
from Yale Medical School

07:34.180 --> 07:37.426
as a surgeon and joined the US Army.

07:37.456 --> 07:39.589
He had blood in his hands

07:39.624 --> 07:41.527
and he was trying to put...

07:41.559 --> 07:44.531
people's brains back into their heads,

07:44.566 --> 07:47.291
and he was like, Oh, my god,

07:47.321 --> 07:48.575
this is [bleep] up.

07:48.605 --> 07:52.096
This is messing up my head.

07:52.126 --> 07:53.549
They diagnosed him

07:53.581 --> 07:55.618
with delusional paranoia.

07:55.653 --> 07:58.857
I gotta get out of here.
I'm going to move to London.

07:58.891 --> 08:02.481
February 17th, 1872,

08:02.511 --> 08:03.734
W.C. Minor

08:03.766 --> 08:05.336
wakes up in the middle of the night

08:05.369 --> 08:06.906
in a paranoid fit.

08:06.939 --> 08:08.742
He grabbed his gun.

08:08.776 --> 08:10.646
He thinks that a man

08:10.679 --> 08:12.282
has broken into his home

08:12.316 --> 08:13.785
and is trying to kill him.

08:13.817 --> 08:15.325
He runs outside.

08:15.355 --> 08:16.622
At that very moment,

08:16.656 --> 08:18.660
George Merrett was on his way to work

08:18.694 --> 08:20.383
at a brewery, like,

08:20.413 --> 08:21.797
do-do-do-do-do,

08:21.831 --> 08:23.802
♪ I'm on my way to work ♪

08:23.836 --> 08:25.972
♪ I got six kids ♪

08:26.007 --> 08:28.946
♪ My wife, Eliza, is pregnant ♪

08:28.979 --> 08:31.216
♪ Ain't life glorious ♪

08:31.249 --> 08:32.686
He turns around,

08:32.719 --> 08:34.388
he sees W.C. Minor

08:34.421 --> 08:35.924
run out of his house with a gun.

08:35.956 --> 08:38.260
Minor shoots George Merrett,

08:38.294 --> 08:42.368
fatally wounding him dead in the neck.

08:42.403 --> 08:45.141
W.C. Minor get entered into the

08:45.173 --> 08:50.250
Broadmoor Asylum for
the Criminally Insane.

08:50.283 --> 08:52.319
So because W.C. Minor

08:52.352 --> 08:55.157
was a prestigious doctor,
he get special treatment

08:55.192 --> 08:56.861
in the asylum.

08:56.891 --> 08:58.898
They give him two cells.

08:58.932 --> 09:01.403
They reunite him with
all of his possessions.

09:01.437 --> 09:02.972
He has so many books

09:03.005 --> 09:04.808
that he takes his second cell

09:04.841 --> 09:06.700
and turns it into a library.

09:06.730 --> 09:10.787
However, he's still racked
with the tremendous guilt

09:10.820 --> 09:12.355
over this murder.

09:12.389 --> 09:15.061
So W.C. Minor contacts

09:15.094 --> 09:17.431
the murder... Um...

09:17.465 --> 09:19.268
He wrote to his, uh,

09:19.302 --> 09:23.475
He want... he wrote
to his victim's widow,

09:23.908 --> 09:25.779
Eliza Merrett.

09:25.813 --> 09:28.851
Eliza pays Minor a visit.

09:28.884 --> 09:32.793
He said, Thank you for
coming today, Mrs. Merrett.

09:32.826 --> 09:34.709
Um, should I say

09:34.739 --> 09:36.466
Miss Merrett,

09:36.499 --> 09:38.469
now that you're single?

09:40.799 --> 09:42.022
Too soon.

09:42.052 --> 09:43.445
Too soon.

09:43.479 --> 09:45.882
All of a sudden, she notices behind him

09:45.916 --> 09:47.419
the guy's got a lot of books.

09:47.451 --> 09:49.088
So she says, like,

09:49.121 --> 09:51.091
I notice you have a lot of books.

09:51.125 --> 09:52.616
What kind of books do you got?

09:52.646 --> 09:55.131
Nothing much. Just a bunch of, like,

09:55.166 --> 09:58.939
interesting books by
people like Jonathan Swift.

09:58.972 --> 10:01.342
She's like, I love Jonathan Swift.

10:01.376 --> 10:04.824
"Gulliver's Travels"? That's
like, my favorite book.

10:04.854 --> 10:08.809
He's like, Me too. Like, OMG.

10:08.839 --> 10:10.326
You... you're just like me.

10:10.360 --> 10:12.129
She starts coming to visit him

10:12.163 --> 10:14.265
at the asylum, like, once a month.

10:14.299 --> 10:18.005
Every time, she brings a
bundle of new books for him.

10:18.039 --> 10:20.510
He's giving her some
books from his library.

10:20.544 --> 10:22.147
This is crazy.

10:22.181 --> 10:24.518
This is the guy that
murdered her husband,

10:24.552 --> 10:26.154
and they're, like,

10:26.188 --> 10:28.259
have a book club?

10:28.679 --> 10:29.460
What?

10:29.494 --> 10:31.297
In one of these bundles of books

10:31.331 --> 10:32.971
there's a notice from a man named

10:33.001 --> 10:34.069
James Murray.

10:34.103 --> 10:35.671
Hear ye, hear ye.

10:35.704 --> 10:39.489
All y'all bibliophiles
out there, listen up.

10:39.519 --> 10:43.739
I am writing the very first
Oxford English Dictionary.

10:43.769 --> 10:46.273
We're looking for volunteers

10:46.307 --> 10:48.690
to submit your words,

10:48.720 --> 10:50.786
along with quotations

10:50.816 --> 10:52.819
from the English literature.

10:52.852 --> 10:55.323
W.C. Minor sees this notification,

10:55.358 --> 10:59.365
he's like, This is
what I was born to do!

10:59.398 --> 11:02.539
W.C. Minor writes in to
James Murray and says,

11:02.569 --> 11:05.108
Will you please see it in your heart

11:05.141 --> 11:07.849
to allow me to "contribut-ee"

11:07.879 --> 11:10.418
to your great Oxford English Dictionary?

11:10.451 --> 11:12.288
And they kinda look at this letter,

11:12.321 --> 11:14.691
and they're like, Yeah, dude.

11:14.725 --> 11:17.289
Of course. Here's the list of words.

11:17.319 --> 11:19.432
Bonnet. Boner.

11:19.466 --> 11:20.736
Bona fide.

11:20.769 --> 11:22.405
He takes this list of words

11:22.438 --> 11:24.275
and he's like, Okay.

11:24.310 --> 11:26.380
I'm like a search engine

11:26.413 --> 11:27.682
I'm gonna, like,

11:27.715 --> 11:29.685
spend the next year of my life

11:29.719 --> 11:32.123
going through hundreds
and hundreds of books,

11:32.157 --> 11:34.795
looking for uses of these words.

11:34.827 --> 11:36.264
The years go by.

11:36.297 --> 11:39.069
W.C. Minor is like, doing so much work,

11:39.101 --> 11:41.172
and getting so much joy out of it,

11:41.206 --> 11:43.009
It's giving him so much purpinizes...

11:43.043 --> 11:44.712
purpose in his life.

11:44.745 --> 11:47.350
So finally, after
years of correspondence,

11:47.384 --> 11:49.387
they finally meet face-to face.

11:49.421 --> 11:51.124
They sit down and they chat.

11:51.157 --> 11:54.028
And these guys completely hit it off.

11:54.062 --> 11:56.032
They share their love
for the rich complexity

11:56.066 --> 11:57.739
of the English language.

11:57.769 --> 11:59.873
They're like BFF overnight.

11:59.906 --> 12:04.050
And James Murray gave him
his six completed volumes

12:04.080 --> 12:05.852
of the Oxford...

12:07.088 --> 12:09.337
English Dictionary,

12:09.367 --> 12:10.726
and said,

12:10.760 --> 12:11.928
Thank you

12:11.962 --> 12:15.370
for your hard work and dedication.

12:15.400 --> 12:18.305
You dedicated all... uh,

12:18.339 --> 12:20.009
so much of your life

12:20.043 --> 12:23.414
to the Oxford English Dictionary.

12:23.448 --> 12:26.353
And he's like,

12:26.387 --> 12:28.023
You're welcome.

12:28.057 --> 12:29.864
W.C. Minor contributed

12:29.894 --> 12:31.263
somewhere in the neighborhood

12:31.295 --> 12:33.699
of about 200,000 quotations

12:33.733 --> 12:38.007
for the Oxford English Dictionary.

12:38.040 --> 12:39.877
The end.

12:39.911 --> 12:41.112
Let's cheers to him.

12:41.146 --> 12:42.748
W.C.!

12:44.252 --> 12:46.222
Stay tuned for more "Drunk History."

12:46.779 --> 12:47.779
Oh!

12:53.234 --> 12:55.505
Here, can I tell you
something that's really...

12:55.539 --> 12:57.273
honest to god, you won't like this.

12:57.303 --> 12:58.076
So these...

12:58.111 --> 12:59.547
- Oh, God.
- Boots.

12:59.579 --> 13:01.215
Have been in my garage.

13:01.250 --> 13:03.554
The last time I went in my garage,

13:03.587 --> 13:05.023
do you know what I found?

13:05.057 --> 13:06.025
No.

13:06.058 --> 13:07.208
Black widows.

13:09.363 --> 13:10.331
Oh, fuck!

13:12.484 --> 13:14.539
I'm glad you find it funny

13:14.573 --> 13:16.910
that there could be a...
oh, what the [bleep] is that?

13:16.944 --> 13:18.145
There's something in that one.

13:22.453 --> 13:24.457
You have to be so careful!

13:24.491 --> 13:26.361
Yeah, I have to be careful.

13:31.264 --> 13:32.974
Let's do it, man.

13:33.006 --> 13:34.006
Hello.

13:35.562 --> 13:36.562
Hello.

13:37.146 --> 13:38.482
My name...

13:38.516 --> 13:41.188
is Duncan Trussell.

13:42.208 --> 13:44.493
And today, we will talk

13:44.526 --> 13:48.066
about Jack Parsons.

13:48.101 --> 13:49.570
Uh, Jack Parsons

13:49.602 --> 13:51.238
was always interested in

13:51.271 --> 13:54.177
rockets and explosives.

13:54.211 --> 13:57.183
1937, Jack Parsons...

13:57.217 --> 13:58.752
Just say it.

13:58.785 --> 14:00.255
- I got it, I got it.
- Just repeat it.

14:00.288 --> 14:02.495
I [bleep] got it! Derek.

14:02.525 --> 14:05.365
In 1937, Jack Parsons,

14:05.397 --> 14:07.600
Ed Forman, and Frank Malina

14:07.635 --> 14:09.376
were doing rocket tests

14:09.406 --> 14:12.144
at Devil's Gate Dam.

14:12.176 --> 14:13.979
So, they ended up

14:14.013 --> 14:16.654
inventing something
called the JATO rocket,

14:16.684 --> 14:18.755
and sure enough, the
United States military

14:18.785 --> 14:19.890
caught wind of this

14:19.923 --> 14:21.393
and came to them,

14:21.426 --> 14:22.798
and the military was like,

14:22.828 --> 14:24.298
You guys seem to know what you're doing.

14:24.332 --> 14:26.102
Why don't we get together

14:26.135 --> 14:29.076
and work on better explosives

14:29.106 --> 14:31.802
than what you guys are
blowing up by the dam?

14:31.832 --> 14:34.150
Jack Parsons got a bunch of money.

14:34.182 --> 14:37.459
He buys a mansion in
the heart of Pasadena,

14:37.489 --> 14:39.158
and while this was happening,

14:39.191 --> 14:40.851
he came into contact

14:40.881 --> 14:44.032
with Aleister Crowley.

14:44.066 --> 14:46.938
He was considered one
of the great occultists

14:46.971 --> 14:50.510
of our age, who teaches Parsons

14:50.545 --> 14:53.049
about sex magic. Right.

14:53.083 --> 14:54.682
Like, this is... do you
know about sex magic?

14:54.712 --> 14:56.114
No, but yes, please.

14:56.144 --> 14:58.225
Okay. Let me tell you.

14:58.616 --> 15:01.264
Now, sex magic is
like, the idea is, like,

15:01.605 --> 15:06.273
cumming... orgasm... ejaculation.

15:06.669 --> 15:09.379
This is the essence

15:09.412 --> 15:11.984
of what makes life
happen on this planet.

15:12.017 --> 15:13.686
That moment of orgasm

15:13.719 --> 15:15.522
is so powerful,

15:15.556 --> 15:17.661
if you experience an orgasm

15:17.695 --> 15:20.400
while focusing your intention or will,

15:20.432 --> 15:22.068
you can make magic happen.

15:22.101 --> 15:23.303
You can make things happen.

15:23.338 --> 15:26.710
Let's summon spirits and hump.

15:27.011 --> 15:28.546
For a long time.

15:28.580 --> 15:31.686
And that's what was happening.

15:31.719 --> 15:33.690
He's doing these occult rituals

15:33.723 --> 15:37.094
and he is fucking all day long,

15:37.128 --> 15:39.667
cumming and cumming and cumming

15:39.700 --> 15:41.469
and casting spells,

15:41.503 --> 15:43.205
and in the end of the day,

15:43.239 --> 15:44.743
he's going to work,

15:44.776 --> 15:46.148
and he's like, Hey, man,

15:46.178 --> 15:49.183
you guys care if I do
a fucking magic spell

15:49.217 --> 15:51.120
before we launch this missile?

15:51.154 --> 15:52.890
They're like, all right,

15:52.924 --> 15:54.493
dude, I guess so.

15:54.526 --> 15:57.970
We're trying to fucking
make the planet better.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.070
And he's intoning this
thing called the Hymn to Pan.

16:01.105 --> 16:03.409
Oh, I, Pan,

16:03.443 --> 16:05.547
I, Pan.

16:05.581 --> 16:07.918
So he is out of his gourd,

16:07.952 --> 16:09.354
but they're doing great,

16:09.386 --> 16:11.423
and his fucking friends are like,

16:11.457 --> 16:13.427
Let's start a company.

16:13.677 --> 16:16.066
We'll call it JPL:

16:16.098 --> 16:19.273
Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

16:19.303 --> 16:20.071
Oh, wow.

16:20.106 --> 16:21.308
One of the founders

16:21.342 --> 16:23.178
of, like, the...

16:23.212 --> 16:25.249
one of the corp... the companies

16:25.282 --> 16:28.921
that is responsible for
space exploration today.

16:28.954 --> 16:30.991
If you know what [bleep] Saturn

16:31.025 --> 16:32.328
looks like right now,

16:32.361 --> 16:33.930
the rings of Saturn,

16:33.963 --> 16:36.100
the Cassini fucking probe around it,

16:36.135 --> 16:37.404
the Mars rover,

16:37.437 --> 16:39.407
all of this has its roots

16:39.439 --> 16:42.011
in Jack Parsons

16:42.045 --> 16:44.984
in a mansion in fucking Pasadena,

16:45.018 --> 16:47.904
mumbling occult rituals

16:47.934 --> 16:50.327
while snorting blow

16:50.360 --> 16:52.430
off of his friends' boobs.

16:52.463 --> 16:54.300
And...

16:54.333 --> 16:55.937
It's outstanding.

16:56.591 --> 16:58.307
So, and a fellow shows up

16:58.341 --> 17:00.794
by the name of

17:00.824 --> 17:04.385
L. Ron Hubbard.

17:04.419 --> 17:07.829
He's this sci-fi writer
with crazy stories,

17:07.858 --> 17:09.265
he's very charismatic,

17:09.295 --> 17:11.435
and Parsons is like, hey, man,

17:11.464 --> 17:13.167
you're awesome.

17:13.200 --> 17:16.539
Do you have any interest
in having sex with my wife?

17:16.573 --> 17:18.310
And Hubbard is like,

17:18.343 --> 17:20.313
Yeah. L. Ron Hubbard

17:20.348 --> 17:25.991
just starts fucking Jack Parsons' wife.

17:26.023 --> 17:27.359
And Jack Parsons is like,

17:27.392 --> 17:29.429
I like you, you're my
friend, L. Ron Hubbard.

17:29.464 --> 17:31.467
Let's just have sex and do sex magic

17:31.501 --> 17:33.404
while I, like, blow up rockets!

17:33.437 --> 17:35.741
He's partying so fucking hard.

17:35.774 --> 17:39.046
But then the FBI visit Jack Parsons,

17:39.081 --> 17:41.118
and they're like, Hey, um...

17:41.150 --> 17:44.055
You have military-grade
weapons clearance.

17:44.090 --> 17:46.461
You're also into the occult.

17:46.494 --> 17:48.197
You're doing magic spells.

17:48.230 --> 17:50.133
You're going to Communist meetings,

17:50.167 --> 17:51.439
and we've heard that
you might want to, like,

17:51.469 --> 17:52.559
sell some of this information

17:52.589 --> 17:54.475
to the Israeli military.

17:54.509 --> 17:56.011
So, uh,

17:56.045 --> 17:58.015
we're going to take away
your military clearance,

17:58.049 --> 18:00.319
because you can't fucking do that.

18:00.681 --> 18:01.520
So,

18:01.553 --> 18:03.523
he lost his military clearance.

18:03.799 --> 18:05.427
He says to L. Ron Hubbard,

18:05.462 --> 18:06.530
What do we do, man?

18:06.562 --> 18:07.535
We're running out of money.

18:07.565 --> 18:08.760
I don't know what I'm going to do,

18:08.790 --> 18:09.792
and Hubbard is like,

18:09.822 --> 18:11.805
I think I know what you can do.

18:11.840 --> 18:14.341
You... we will start a boat business,

18:14.371 --> 18:16.047
and you will give me

18:16.080 --> 18:18.118
the last of your money,

18:18.151 --> 18:20.421
and I will go to Florida with your wife,

18:20.455 --> 18:21.958
and we will be fine.

18:21.992 --> 18:24.229
And Parsons is... is like, okay.

18:24.263 --> 18:26.099
Sure.

18:26.744 --> 18:29.237
I trust you, man.

18:29.272 --> 18:30.875
You're my best friend.

18:30.907 --> 18:33.599
Who couldn't trust someone like you,

18:33.629 --> 18:35.015
L. Ron Hubbard?

18:37.351 --> 18:40.492
And he gives him $20,000!

18:43.433 --> 18:44.585
I love you so much

18:44.615 --> 18:46.333
I love you too, Derek.

18:46.615 --> 18:48.977
Hubbard goes to Florida
with Jack Parsons' wife.

18:49.007 --> 18:50.508
And Parsons is like,

18:50.542 --> 18:52.899
Wait, I haven't heard from
L. Ron Hubbard in a few days.

18:52.929 --> 18:55.551
So, he calls L. Ron Hubbard,

18:55.584 --> 18:56.953
What's going on?

18:56.986 --> 18:58.522
Like, what's going on?

18:58.557 --> 19:01.429
Sorry. You fucked up,

19:01.462 --> 19:03.001
and I'm with your wife,

19:03.031 --> 19:04.701
on a boat, going to F...

19:04.734 --> 19:06.705
out of Florida's... wherever Florida is.

19:06.737 --> 19:09.342
And Jack Parsons is like, No.

19:09.376 --> 19:10.444
Fuck that.

19:10.477 --> 19:11.813
I'm a wizard.

19:11.847 --> 19:13.620
I'm a fucking wizard.

19:14.136 --> 19:17.757
And Jack Parsons cast a spell.

19:17.791 --> 19:21.965
Om...

19:23.000 --> 19:29.074

19:32.925 --> 19:34.988
But that's just your interpretation.

19:35.022 --> 19:36.591
Yeah. That's probably the spell

19:36.625 --> 19:38.027
- I would imagine he did.
- Yeah. Who knows?

19:38.057 --> 19:39.914
And then it starts...

19:46.827 --> 19:48.730
Something in that vein.

19:49.434 --> 19:51.667
Oh, check, please.

19:51.702 --> 19:53.142
He called up a storm,

19:53.172 --> 19:56.110
and Hubbard and Betty had to turn around

19:56.142 --> 19:57.377
'cause the storm was too powerful

19:57.411 --> 19:59.248
to proceed.

19:59.282 --> 20:01.797
And L. Ron Hubbard
gave him his money back,

20:01.827 --> 20:03.223
but took his wife,

20:03.255 --> 20:06.227
and started a religion
called Scientology.

20:06.613 --> 20:08.264
Um...

20:08.299 --> 20:10.135
And then, in a garage,

20:10.168 --> 20:13.441
while experimenting with
some explosive chemicals,

20:13.474 --> 20:16.714
he exploded himself in Pasadena,

20:16.747 --> 20:19.418
killing himself.

20:19.876 --> 20:21.326
Is this proof of...

20:22.857 --> 20:25.730
what we love kills us?

20:26.095 --> 20:29.503
No. It's proof that if
you're fucking around with

20:29.536 --> 20:31.773
fulminate of mercury, don't drop it.

20:31.808 --> 20:33.644
There's no magical thing here.

20:33.676 --> 20:35.446
Don't do speed and fuck with explosives.
