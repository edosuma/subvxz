WEBVTT

00:01.609 --> 00:02.998
Stella: Previously on
"Life Sentence"...

00:03.040 --> 00:04.257
Someone should convert
this into a bar.

00:04.300 --> 00:05.346
This is amazing.

00:05.390 --> 00:07.471
You want to buy a bar?

00:07.520 --> 00:08.783
Why do you think a bank

00:08.830 --> 00:10.480
is gonna hand you money
to open a bar?

00:10.530 --> 00:13.044
Because I have a friend
who knows all the ins and outs

00:13.100 --> 00:14.704
on the financial stuff,
and he's gonna coach me.

00:14.750 --> 00:16.354
This is gonna turn out
to be me, isn't it?

00:16.400 --> 00:18.266
Ida: I've been thinking
about our Kiss.

00:18.320 --> 00:19.879
I've been thinking
about that, too.

00:19.930 --> 00:21.750
I think that we both know
that moment is over.

00:21.800 --> 00:24.235
Yeah, that's exactly
what I was thinking.

00:24.280 --> 00:25.406
This could be
something real.

00:25.460 --> 00:27.588
The last real thing I had
I screwed up.

00:27.630 --> 00:29.018
My big brother's name
was Jesse.

00:29.070 --> 00:31.232
And every single patient
I treat, I see him.

00:31.290 --> 00:33.987
When I lose one, I lose
my brother all over again.

00:34.030 --> 00:35.896
You had a wedding with Pippa?!
So, what?

00:35.940 --> 00:38.204
Sh-She just left you
at the altar?

00:38.250 --> 00:39.684
Stella:
I had told myself

00:39.730 --> 00:41.289
that things between me and Wes
were fine after Pippa,

00:41.340 --> 00:42.557
but maybe they're not?

00:42.600 --> 00:43.726
Do you have
feelings for him? No.

00:43.780 --> 00:44.861
We might need
someone to help us

00:44.910 --> 00:46.127
sort through
our specific problems,

00:46.170 --> 00:47.649
like Dr. Grant and Pippa.

00:47.690 --> 00:49.306
Counseling. We do have
a lot to sort through.

00:49.350 --> 00:50.772
So you're our
couples counselor?

00:50.830 --> 00:53.470
Miles: Yes, I assure you,
I am qualified.

00:54.700 --> 00:56.395
Great session.
See you next time.

00:56.440 --> 00:59.228
Actually, we wanted
to talk to you about that.

00:59.270 --> 01:02.797
We've been doing so well
since we started coming here...

01:02.840 --> 01:04.535
We've been "checking in"
night and day,

01:04.580 --> 01:06.093
looking for
"win-win solutions..."

01:06.150 --> 01:08.403
And we are back to having
Sara Bareilles candle sex

01:08.450 --> 01:10.145
like three times a week.

01:11.240 --> 01:13.106
We were just wondering

01:13.160 --> 01:16.107
if maybe it was time
to take off the training wheels.

01:16.160 --> 01:18.857
And work our new tools
all by ourselves.

01:18.900 --> 01:21.688
At home.
Without you there.

01:21.730 --> 01:23.596
Did I do something wrong?

01:23.640 --> 01:26.382
No, not at all!
You did something right.

01:26.430 --> 01:28.467
In fact, congratulations
are in order.

01:28.520 --> 01:30.033
You did it, kid.
Yep.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.559
Well, it sounds like
you made a decision.

01:32.610 --> 01:35.216
And that you made it
together.

01:35.260 --> 01:37.046
So, good for you.

01:37.090 --> 01:40.310
But if anything comes up,
my door is always open.

01:40.360 --> 01:41.703
<i>-0
Oh, My -</i>

01:41.750 --> 01:43.570
Well, actually, no.
Your door is locked.

01:43.620 --> 01:45.395
Ah,
It does that sometimes.

01:48.320 --> 01:49.185
There.

01:49.230 --> 01:50.311
-Oh, okay.
-Bye.

01:50.370 --> 01:52.452
-See ya.
-Bye.

01:52.500 --> 01:54.150
Was that too abrupt?

01:54.200 --> 01:56.237
I mean, maybe we should have
had a few more sessions?

01:56.290 --> 01:59.373
No. We've been at it for weeks,
and it's worked wonders,

01:59.420 --> 02:01.730
but now we need
to try it on our own.

02:01.770 --> 02:03.158
See if it sticks,
you know?

02:03.210 --> 02:04.462
Yeah, but I gotta go.

02:04.510 --> 02:06.239
I've got a volunteer shift
with my name on it.

02:06.300 --> 02:08.371
Yeah, I should probably
get back to work, as well.

02:08.430 --> 02:10.205
Aiden's been texting
about "a surprise”

02:10.259 --> 02:12.206
he has for me,
and I'm terrified.

02:12.260 --> 02:13.557
Oh.
Is everything okay?

02:13.610 --> 02:15.169
We just haven't really been
seeing eye-to-eye

02:15.220 --> 02:17.643
on what things are and are not
worth spending money on.

02:17.700 --> 02:18.917
But I'll sort it out.

02:18.960 --> 02:21.133
I am looking for
"win-win solutions."

02:26.880 --> 02:30.532
Not to brag, but I was really
killing it at marriage.

02:30.580 --> 02:31.661
Well, thank you
for nothing!

02:31.710 --> 02:33.530
And work was going well, too.

02:33.580 --> 02:35.537
Stella, there's something foul
in the break-room fridge.

02:35.590 --> 02:36.921
Can you
get to the bottom of it?

02:36.980 --> 02:38.846
Are we short
on janitors today?

02:38.890 --> 02:40.585
No, why?

02:40.630 --> 02:44.021
NO reason.
I am on it.

02:44.070 --> 02:46.027
Hey, Elaine,
is everything okay?

02:46.070 --> 02:47.765
Sheila in Community Outreach
just quit

02:47.810 --> 02:49.153
and left me
with a half-planned

02:49.210 --> 02:51.110
bone marrow drive
at the rec center.

02:51.170 --> 02:53.593
Why would she plan a bone marrow
drive at the rec center?

02:53.650 --> 02:55.300
18- to 30-year-olds
are the most viable donors,

02:55.340 --> 02:57.513
and nobody under the age of 60
goes to the rec center.

02:57.560 --> 02:58.868
You know a lot
about bone marrow.

02:58.910 --> 02:59.991
I was supposed to
have a transplant,

03:00.040 --> 03:01.257
but we couldn't
find a match.

03:01.310 --> 03:02.914
I ended up
getting into a trial,

03:02.960 --> 03:04.655
but I know that most kids
don't make it that far,

03:04.700 --> 03:06.395
so that's why these drives
are so important.

03:06.440 --> 03:07.965
I could really
use your help.

03:08.010 --> 03:09.614
Sure. What do you need?Take the whole thing over.

03:09.660 --> 03:11.799
Starting with getting a few
hundred 18- to 30-year-olds

03:11.840 --> 03:13.615
to the rec center
on Friday.

03:13.670 --> 03:16.662
Well, that is my demo,
so leave it me.

03:16.710 --> 03:19.054
I-I won't let you down!

03:21.760 --> 03:26.231
So, Gina and I are
kinda getting serious.

03:26.290 --> 03:27.246
Oh? Do tell.

03:27.290 --> 03:29.543
We're talking
about the future.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.284
And, uh, to that end,

03:31.340 --> 03:35.072
I may have told her that you
and I were officially divorced.

03:35.120 --> 03:36.599
Oh.

03:43.440 --> 03:46.307
- Are these
divorce papers?

03:46.350 --> 03:47.784
Sorry to spring this
on you,

03:47.830 --> 03:50.481
but I didn't think
it would be a problem,

03:50.530 --> 03:54.444
given the fact that...
you left me.

03:54.490 --> 03:56.049
No. It's not a problem.

03:56.100 --> 03:57.613
I would be thrilled
to sign these.

03:57.670 --> 03:59.274
Give 'em the old
Jane Hancock.

03:59.320 --> 04:02.881
Make my mark.
I just, um...

04:02.930 --> 04:05.012
You know,
I don't have a pen.

04:07.420 --> 04:08.490
Oh.

04:14.250 --> 04:19.029
You know, uh, signing divorce
papers is like peeing --

04:19.079 --> 04:21.515
hard to do with
someone watching.

04:21.560 --> 04:23.870
Take your time.

04:23.910 --> 04:26.345
And thank you for being
so great about this.

04:26.390 --> 04:27.869
Of course.

04:27.910 --> 04:31.210
Love Gina.
So happy for you.

04:31.270 --> 04:32.396
Thanks.

04:39.230 --> 04:41.483
Don't worry about a thing

04:41.540 --> 04:45.056
You'll learn to live again

04:45.110 --> 04:47.147
You're gonna learn
to live again

04:47.190 --> 04:51.366
Oh, oh, oh

04:54.030 --> 04:55.247
Ta-da!

04:55.290 --> 04:57.759
Uh...
I'm confused.

04:57.810 --> 05:00.290
I thought we agreed you were
gonna take care of the sign.

05:00.340 --> 05:02.468
And I did.
It works perfectly now.

05:02.510 --> 05:04.387
No, no,
I meant take it down

05:04.430 --> 05:07.070
and put up a sign
that says "bar."

05:07.130 --> 05:09.644
But this sign is cool
and vintage and --

05:09.700 --> 05:11.350
Does not say
the word "bar."

05:11.390 --> 05:13.392
"Cause we're not a bar, Wes.
We're a speakeasy.

05:13.440 --> 05:15.260
We don't want just anybody
coming in here.

05:15.310 --> 05:19.099
We want the mystique...
of Miss Steak.

05:19.140 --> 05:22.440
So, what you're saying is,
you spent money on a sign

05:22.490 --> 05:25.619
that keeps our bar a secret
from the general public?

05:25.670 --> 05:27.365
Yeah.
Now you're getting it.

05:27.410 --> 05:28.923
Hey, guys.
What's up?

05:28.980 --> 05:32.063
I just wanted to, uh,
offer my, uh, congratulations.

05:32.110 --> 05:33.714
I had no idea that
you were doing this.

05:33.760 --> 05:35.455
Wait. Really?
No one told you?

05:35.500 --> 05:36.638
Not a soul.

05:36.680 --> 05:38.068
I actually found out
from Lizzie

05:38.120 --> 05:39.451
before she left town
to meet with her publisher.

05:39.510 --> 05:41.672
Anyways, uh, she wanted me
to drop this off.

05:41.730 --> 05:44.552
It's, uh, an old framed
photo of this place.

05:44.600 --> 05:45.772
She figured that
it'd be nice to have

05:45.820 --> 05:47.470
once you guys take down
the old sign.

05:47.520 --> 05:48.908
We're not taking
the sign down.

05:48.950 --> 05:50.679
So, how are people supposed to
know that this is a bar?

05:50.740 --> 05:52.515
Oh! I rest my case.

05:52.560 --> 05:53.641
They're not
supposed to know,

05:53.700 --> 05:57.819
but then they come in
and it is one.

05:57.870 --> 05:59.395
That is cool!
Okay. Okay.

05:59.440 --> 06:00.692
And I rest my case.

06:00.750 --> 06:03.617
Oh! Oh! Oh!

06:03.660 --> 06:05.446
-Whoa!
-I'm gonna get that fixed.

06:05.490 --> 06:06.571
No, you're not!

06:06.620 --> 06:08.440
Come on, Wes.
I know bars.

06:08.490 --> 06:12.529
I know what makes bars cool
because I am the cool one.

06:12.580 --> 06:13.979
I think we're
equally cool.

06:14.020 --> 06:16.842
Really? I think your
flannel shirt is tucked in.

06:16.890 --> 06:18.801
Look, the point is,
we are gonna run out of money

06:18.850 --> 06:21.717
if we keep wasting it
on signs that don't work

06:21.770 --> 06:23.761
and whatever it is
you're about to show me.

06:23.810 --> 06:27.155
Custom-etched glasses with
a graphic of my design.

06:27.210 --> 06:28.632
Goes with the whole
"what people in the '50s

06:28.690 --> 06:30.385
thought the future
would look like" vibe.

06:30.430 --> 06:32.683
You mean the "mid-century
modern" furniture

06:32.740 --> 06:33.901
that you
spent too much on?

06:33.950 --> 06:36.647
Oh! It's super comfy.

06:38.180 --> 06:41.343
Wes, most bars close
within the first three months

06:41.400 --> 06:44.040
"cause people come once
and they don't come back.

06:44.090 --> 06:47.003
I am trying to create a vibe
that creates a buzz

06:47.050 --> 06:48.484
that prevents that
from happening.

06:48.530 --> 06:50.441
And I am trying to make sure
that we don't close

06:50.490 --> 06:52.185
before we even open.

06:52.230 --> 06:54.699
You have already blown through
our four-week start-up fund.

06:54.760 --> 06:56.751
Then we'll open early.
How about Friday?

06:56.800 --> 06:58.017
Diego, are you free Friday?

06:58.060 --> 06:59.585
Sure,
I've got nothing going on.

06:59.630 --> 07:01.678
Because nobody asked me
to be a part of anything.

07:01.720 --> 07:03.233
How are we
gonna open early

07:03.290 --> 07:04.678
when we don't even have
money for advertising?

07:04.720 --> 07:06.597
Can't you move
some numbers around?

07:06.640 --> 07:07.983
There are no numbers
to move.

07:08.030 --> 07:09.941
Then we'll get creative.

07:09.990 --> 07:12.459
All right, you, you put
your thinking cap on,

07:12.510 --> 07:14.729
and I...

07:14.780 --> 07:17.943
will fire up
the snow cone machine.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.435
By the way, I-I bought
a snow cone machine.

07:24.050 --> 07:27.088
-Oh. Dr. Grant, hello.
-Hey.

07:27.140 --> 07:29.700
So, I am hosting this
bone marrow drive on Friday,

07:29.750 --> 07:31.616
and I was wondering if --No.

07:31.660 --> 07:34.095
Well, you didn't hear
what I needed.

07:34.140 --> 07:35.278
Well, you said
it was on Friday,

07:35.320 --> 07:37.015
and I'm not available
on Friday.

07:37.060 --> 07:39.495
Okay. Well, do you think
that I could have access

07:39.540 --> 07:40.848
to your patient profiles

07:40.890 --> 07:42.369
to see if there's
a potential match?

07:42.410 --> 07:44.492
Sure. I will, uh,
leave them here for later.

07:44.550 --> 07:46.279
Hey?

07:46.330 --> 07:47.764
Are you okay?

07:47.810 --> 07:49.585
Yeah.
Why wouldn't I be okay?

07:49.640 --> 07:51.984
I don't know.
That's why I was asking.

07:52.030 --> 07:53.634
Don't worry about me,
Stella.

07:59.390 --> 08:01.347
Oh! Sorry.

08:03.520 --> 08:05.124
Thank you for this.

08:05.180 --> 08:08.081
It's been a weird day, and your
grilled cheese comforts me.

08:08.130 --> 08:12.567
My trick is the Dijon mustard.
It really pops the cheddar.

08:12.620 --> 08:13.837
MmMmm.

08:13.880 --> 08:15.871
I mean,
I'm happy for Peter,

08:15.930 --> 08:19.275
so why am I freaking out
about signing some papers?

08:19.320 --> 08:24.099
Well, because divorce
just seems final, you know.

08:24.150 --> 08:25.458
One day
you're part of something,

08:25.500 --> 08:26.843
and the next day
your brother-in-laws

08:26.890 --> 08:28.756
are opening up a bar
without you.

08:28.810 --> 08:30.938
Does Peter think he's gonna
marry this woman?

08:30.980 --> 08:34.462
Do Wes and Aiden think I'm not
cool enough to be part of it?

08:34.510 --> 08:36.854
I should just take the plunge
and keep moving forward, right?

08:36.900 --> 08:39.335
I should just talk to them.
Just ask them straight up.

08:39.380 --> 08:40.813
You know what I like

08:40.860 --> 08:43.557
I like that we really
listen to each other.

08:43.610 --> 08:45.032
Hmm.

08:45.080 --> 08:46.696
-Hey, babe.
-Hi.

08:46.740 --> 08:47.775
-Yep.

08:47.830 --> 08:49.127
How was your day?

08:49.180 --> 08:50.955
Well, your brother
spent all of our money

08:51.000 --> 08:52.786
and wants the bar
to be a secret.

08:52.830 --> 08:54.559
That does not sound good.

08:54.620 --> 08:55.917
Nope.
How was your day?

08:55.970 --> 08:57.779
It was partly amazing.

08:57.840 --> 09:01.356
I get to run a bone marrow
drive for the hospital.

09:01.410 --> 09:02.832
-Babe, that's great!
-I know.

09:02.890 --> 09:04.961
I might directly
save a life.

09:05.020 --> 09:07.318
Wait. Why is it only
partly amazing?

09:07.370 --> 09:10.624
Well, I have to get
a couple hundred 20-somethings

09:10.680 --> 09:12.193
to show up
at the rec center,

09:12.240 --> 09:13.969
and while I have a decent
advertising budget,

09:14.030 --> 09:16.988
I just don't know how
I'm going to get them there.

09:17.030 --> 09:20.250
<i>I can offer you a very expensive
SNOW cone machine.</i>

09:21.820 --> 09:23.424
Aiden bought
a snow cone machine.

09:23.470 --> 09:24.596
That makes sense.

09:24.650 --> 09:27.290
Snow was always
his favorite food group.

09:27.340 --> 09:29.479
That's not a bad idea,
actually.

09:29.520 --> 09:32.990
What? Luring them
in with something fun.

09:33.050 --> 09:37.169
How about...
a bar opening?

09:37.220 --> 09:38.654
That's kind of perfect.

09:38.700 --> 09:39.747
Look at us.

09:39.790 --> 09:42.703
Yeah.We're doing so well.

09:42.750 --> 09:46.789
We definitely
do not need therapy.

09:46.840 --> 09:48.490
Sorry. What'd you say?

09:56.680 --> 09:57.761
-Ida!
-Hey!

09:57.810 --> 09:58.766
What are you
doing here?

09:58.810 --> 09:59.982
Oh, I just
dropped by to say...

10:00.030 --> 10:02.727
you've been served.

10:02.770 --> 10:04.022
Signed, sealed,
delivered.

10:04.080 --> 10:07.641
I'm...not yours
anymore.

10:07.690 --> 10:08.771
Thank you.

10:08.820 --> 10:10.811
Thank you.

10:10.870 --> 10:12.167
For what?

10:12.220 --> 10:15.690
For 30 years...
and three beautiful children.

10:24.580 --> 10:26.708
See you around,
Mr. Abbott.

10:26.750 --> 10:30.835
See you around,
Mrs...Ida.

10:40.070 --> 10:41.674
Aiden: You know I want
to help you, sis,

10:41.720 --> 10:43.893
but I got to say,
a bone marrow drive --

10:43.940 --> 10:46.022
not exactly a sexy way
to open a place.

10:46.080 --> 10:49.072
But it is a great way to get
a crowd together last-minute

10:49.120 --> 10:50.815
without spending money
that we don't have.

10:50.860 --> 10:53.864
Plus, Aiden, you can
make anything sexy.

10:53.910 --> 10:56.902
You're right.
I can even pull off jorts.

10:56.960 --> 10:58.166
Let's do this.

10:58.220 --> 10:59.699
The more people
we get to come,

10:59.740 --> 11:01.048
the better chance we have
of saving a life.

11:01.090 --> 11:02.694
So we need to hand out
all of these flyers.

11:02.740 --> 11:04.913
Well, can we at least agree
to be selective

11:04.960 --> 11:06.177
about who we
give them out to?

11:06.230 --> 11:08.528
So...basically
just pretty girls?

11:08.580 --> 11:10.617
A few dudes.
Like at a five-to-one ratio.

11:10.670 --> 11:14.447
Okay. Operation Bone Drive/
Bar Alive is a go, people.

11:14.490 --> 11:17.016
Yeah, let's definitely
not call it that.

11:17.060 --> 11:18.494
Yeah, I realized that
the minute I said it.

11:18.540 --> 11:21.100
Come on, Aiden!
You can make this sexy!

11:21.150 --> 11:23.289
Oh, baby,
are you goin' my way

11:23.330 --> 11:25.936
I see you kicking off
for holiday

11:25.980 --> 11:30.759
So maybe get to know you,
baby, don't know you at all

11:30.820 --> 11:32.151
Uh, no, no. Tell me how you know

11:32.210 --> 11:34.907
I'm not crazy or a fiend,
oh, oh

11:34.950 --> 11:37.590
Not, not stalker and obscene

11:37.650 --> 11:41.951
Like, like how
you know what I see, oh, okay

11:42.000 --> 11:44.958
Got a feeling, got a feeling,
got a feeling, got a feeling

11:45.000 --> 11:47.697
Got a feeling, got a feeling,
got a feeling, got a feeling

11:47.750 --> 11:49.559
Got a feeling, got a feeling,
got a feeling

11:49.620 --> 11:51.748
I got a feeling,
I got a feeling, got a feeling

11:51.790 --> 11:53.349
Feeling, feeling,
feeling, feeling

11:53.400 --> 11:55.789
I got, got, got,
to get, get, to get

11:55.840 --> 11:58.753
And take your time
and try not to wreck it

11:58.800 --> 12:01.269
On, on, on, off,
off for all kids

12:01.320 --> 12:04.972
Get, get up
and make up your own dance

12:05.020 --> 12:06.101
Hello.

12:06.160 --> 12:07.810
Hi. We are hosting
a bone marrow drive,

12:07.850 --> 12:09.329
and we would love
for you to come.

12:09.380 --> 12:10.893
You will love it. It will be
the best thing for you.

12:10.940 --> 12:12.192
And there might be
a free drink

12:12.250 --> 12:13.411
if you're one of
the first ones there.

12:13.470 --> 12:15.245
Yes.
And give some to your friends.

12:15.290 --> 12:17.201
Like hanging
on a darkened cloud

12:17.250 --> 12:18.854
The wind is movin' slow

12:18.910 --> 12:19.854
Hey, beautiful.

12:19.910 --> 12:21.071
What's a guy got to do

12:21.130 --> 12:22.643
to get you to give him
a little bone marrow?

12:22.690 --> 12:24.738
Well, that all depends --
Oh, Aiden.

12:24.780 --> 12:25.736
Mom?

12:25.780 --> 12:26.770
Hey, Mom.
What are you doing here?

12:26.830 --> 12:28.605
I came
to see your father.

12:28.660 --> 12:30.082
And then
I was feeling nostalgic,

12:30.140 --> 12:32.780
so I peeked into
the art classes.

12:32.830 --> 12:36.710
And I think I might try
to finish my art degree.

12:36.750 --> 12:38.832
Oh, look, free dental dams!
Bye, guys.

12:38.880 --> 12:40.314
-Okay.
-Bye.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.795
Okay. Handed out all my flyers.
We did it!

12:42.840 --> 12:46.367
Yes! Go, team.
Thank you guys so much.

12:46.410 --> 12:49.198
This is going to be the best
bar opening bone drive

12:49.240 --> 12:50.799
in the history of ever!

12:50.850 --> 12:52.102
And also the first.

12:52.160 --> 12:53.810
Definitely the first.

12:59.730 --> 13:01.289
Oh. Hi, Elaine.

13:01.340 --> 13:03.559
So, status update -- I am moving
the drive from the rec center

13:03.600 --> 13:05.386
to my husband's super-cool
new speakeasy.

13:05.430 --> 13:07.034
And I hope that
that's okay with you,

13:07.090 --> 13:08.956
because I just realized I did
not get permission to do that.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.957
You could have it on the
moon for all I care. Great.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.650
Now, more important --

13:12.700 --> 13:14.259
Did you get the thing
out of the break

13:14.310 --> 13:16.654
I did. It was old chicken salad
and it was truly horrible.

13:16.700 --> 13:18.873
But what is most important
is that I came here

13:18.920 --> 13:20.740
to get the cheek swab kits
for tomorrow.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.313
Do you know where
I can find them?I can bring them,

13:22.360 --> 13:23.885
if you promise to hook me up
with a bunch of free drinks.

13:23.930 --> 13:25.227
Done and done.

13:25.280 --> 13:27.886
You know, Elaine,
I like you because y--

13:27.930 --> 13:29.102
Are walking away. Okay.

13:29.150 --> 13:30.197
Dr. Grant:
Are you kidding me?!

13:30.240 --> 13:32.015
You're completely insane!

13:32.070 --> 13:33.367
I'm -- I'm hanging up.

13:33.420 --> 13:35.286
I'm -- I'm -- I'm hanging up.

13:36.770 --> 13:38.067
If that was a patient,

13:38.120 --> 13:40.680
we really need to work
on your bedside manner.

13:42.730 --> 13:46.519
Patients are easy.
Family's hard.

13:49.950 --> 13:51.736
I knew
something was wrong.

13:53.960 --> 13:57.954
My parents are in town
for a dedication for my brother.

13:58.010 --> 14:00.786
And they are
driving me crazy.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.092
Hmm. Yeah.

14:02.140 --> 14:04.450
Families will do that.

14:04.490 --> 14:06.185
Mine certainly does,
as you know.

14:06.230 --> 14:10.189
No, mine takes it
to a whole new level.

14:10.240 --> 14:13.403
My parents haven't been
in the same state for 10 years.

14:13.460 --> 14:15.929
My dad is bringing
his 22-year-old girlfriend,

14:15.980 --> 14:16.936
who is pregnant.

14:16.980 --> 14:19.028
Oh.
Yeah.

14:19.070 --> 14:21.505
And now my mom wants
to bring her pit bull.

14:21.550 --> 14:22.631
You still wanna play
the whole

14:22.680 --> 14:23.897
"whose got a crazier
family" game?

14:23.950 --> 14:26.339
Nope.
Think we have a winner.

14:26.380 --> 14:28.291
Yeah!

14:30.520 --> 14:33.740
The worst part
is that the one person

14:33.780 --> 14:39.310
that used to be able to help me
through the insanity...

14:39.350 --> 14:41.478
isn't here anymore.

14:45.660 --> 14:50.359
I don't know where I would be
without my siblings.

14:50.410 --> 14:53.448
Hey, if you need anything
at all this week,

14:53.500 --> 14:57.277
you just send up that
Bat

14:57.330 --> 14:58.889
Thanks, Stella.

15:01.030 --> 15:02.896
!
-Hey, Diego!

15:02.940 --> 15:04.931
Can I talk to you
about something?

15:04.990 --> 15:09.154
Whoa! Is that jukebox
another gift from Lizzie?

15:09.210 --> 15:11.907
Uh, no. It was, uh --
It was here when I got here.

15:11.950 --> 15:14.942
I may have bid on that
a while ago and totally forgot.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.684
This is a one-of-a-kind
collector's item.

15:16.740 --> 15:18.515
People are totally gonna
flip out over it.

15:18.560 --> 15:21.040
Oh, I'll be the first one
to flip out over it

15:21.090 --> 15:22.216
if it cost
more than $100.

15:22.260 --> 15:23.955
Oh, it definitely did.

15:24.010 --> 15:26.354
I mean, these things can go
for, what, like 10 grand.

15:26.400 --> 15:29.700
10
Did it cost that much?

15:29.750 --> 15:31.445
It might have
cost that much.

15:31.490 --> 15:33.049
But in my defense,
I placed that bid

15:33.100 --> 15:35.410
way before you talked to me
about spending too much money.

15:35.450 --> 15:41.105
There is no defense for buying
a $10,000 CD player!

15:41.150 --> 15:42.879
We could have the biggest
opening of all time,

15:42.940 --> 15:44.283
but without that money
in the bank,

15:44.330 --> 15:45.980
we won't have enough
to stay in business!

15:46.030 --> 15:47.987
Hey, if this is a bad time,
I can go.

15:48.030 --> 15:49.418
How is that possible?

15:49.470 --> 15:51.029
I thought if we had a big
opening night, we'd be fine.

15:51.080 --> 15:52.286
Of course
you thought that, Aiden,

15:52.340 --> 15:53.762
because you never bothered
to ask me

15:53.820 --> 15:56.164
how the business
of our business works!

15:56.210 --> 15:57.723
You just want to do
all the fun stuff.

15:57.780 --> 15:59.384
Well, who doesn't want
to do the fun stuff!?

15:59.430 --> 16:01.216
You know, maybe if you guys
had a third partner,

16:01.260 --> 16:03.604
there'd be somebody here all the
time to mediate and it could --

16:03.650 --> 16:06.210
Okay. I mean,
I'm just saying, it's...

16:06.260 --> 16:08.877
wel'll, I'll -- T'll be here
if you guys need me.

16:17.970 --> 16:18.880
Hi, Pippa.

16:18.930 --> 16:20.238
Pippa: Hi, Wes.
Are you okay?

16:20.280 --> 16:22.499
No, I'm fine.

16:22.540 --> 16:25.760
Actually, no, I'm not fine.

16:25.810 --> 16:27.881
Hey, can I
ask you something?

16:32.730 --> 16:34.027
Hi.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.593
So, you ready
to "check

16:35.640 --> 16:37.165
Because we need to talk.We need to talk.

16:37.210 --> 16:38.291
You go first.You go first.

16:38.340 --> 16:40.069
-No, you go first.
-No, you go first.

16:42.130 --> 16:43.780
I promised Dr. Grant

16:43.820 --> 16:46.733
that I would help him
through a family crisis.

16:46.780 --> 16:48.999
How do you feel
about that?

16:49.050 --> 16:53.089
Pippa called and offered to help
me through a financial crisis.

16:53.140 --> 16:55.359
How do you feel
about that?

16:57.140 --> 16:58.744
Welcome back!

17:04.930 --> 17:06.887
I think it's important
that you don't consider

17:06.930 --> 17:09.148
being back here
a failure.

17:09.200 --> 17:11.976
-I don't.
- I do. A little.

17:12.030 --> 17:15.159
Regardless, it's smart
to unpack the feelings

17:15.200 --> 17:17.510
brought up by inviting
Dr. Grant and Pippa

17:17.550 --> 17:19.461
back into
your personal lives.

17:19.510 --> 17:24.550
We are feeling
super not good about it.

17:24.599 --> 17:27.069
But it feels like
we should be past it.

17:27.130 --> 17:29.258
Right, because we both know
that neither one of us

17:29.300 --> 17:31.382
would ever do anything
to hurt the other.

17:31.440 --> 17:33.659
The only reason I even
took Pippa's call

17:33.700 --> 17:35.259
was because I needed
to talk to someone

17:35.310 --> 17:37.745
about my rubbish
financial situation.

17:37.790 --> 17:39.485
And, plus, it turned out
to be a happy accident,

17:39.530 --> 17:41.316
because she said that
she might be able to help me

17:41.360 --> 17:43.829
find an investor,
which I need.

17:43.880 --> 17:46.190
And the only reason
I offered to help Dr. Grant

17:46.230 --> 17:49.973
is because I know firsthand
exactly what he's going through.

17:50.020 --> 17:51.795
Cancer destroyed
his family.

17:51.850 --> 17:53.272
And I can't just stand here
and watch him suffer

17:53.330 --> 17:54.582
when I know
that I could help.

17:54.630 --> 17:56.325
But, still,
the thought of Stella

17:56.370 --> 17:58.111
helping Dr. Grant feels --

17:58.160 --> 18:03.849
And the thought of Pippa helping
Wes, it just feels similarly...

18:03.900 --> 18:05.117
Super not good.

18:05.170 --> 18:07.116
Extra super.

18:07.170 --> 18:10.731
Look, this is just fear.

18:10.780 --> 18:13.693
But if you two are fully
committed to each other,

18:13.740 --> 18:15.731
then you really have
nothing to be afraid of.

18:15.790 --> 18:17.918
Well, we are.
We are committed.

18:17.960 --> 18:19.041
Fully.

18:19.090 --> 18:22.526
So...huh, what
you're saying is,

18:22.570 --> 18:24.447
we didn't really need
to come here at all.

18:24.490 --> 18:26.390
Not what I was saying.

18:26.450 --> 18:29.624
Um, next week, we should
work on listening.

18:31.320 --> 18:33.106
You, especially.

18:33.150 --> 18:33.924
Hmm.

18:33.980 --> 18:35.584
-Oh.
-Hey!

18:35.630 --> 18:37.234
Can 1
ask you something?

18:37.290 --> 18:38.280
Sure, what's up?

18:38.330 --> 18:39.980
So, I suggested
to Aiden and Wes

18:40.030 --> 18:42.192
that they might need
a third partner,

18:42.250 --> 18:43.854
and they
totally ignored me.

18:43.900 --> 18:45.766
Hey, do you want
to open a bar with me?

18:45.820 --> 18:48.505
It could be Asheville's
first bi bar.

18:48.560 --> 18:50.119
For men and women.

18:50.170 --> 18:51.729
I'm pretty sure
that's just a bar.

18:51.780 --> 18:54.078
I think it's
a million-dollar idea.

18:54.130 --> 18:56.770
And I'm gonna need a million
dollars to afford college.

18:56.830 --> 18:58.514
-I want to,

18:58.570 --> 19:01.301
_ but it's —-
it's too expensive.

19:01.350 --> 19:02.693
And the last time
I checked,

19:02.750 --> 19:04.263
they not giving out
scholarships to people

19:04.310 --> 19:06.176
who are older than dust.

19:06.230 --> 19:07.391
You're not old.

19:07.450 --> 19:08.963
Honestly,
there are sometimes

19:09.010 --> 19:10.739
that I think it's mathematically
impossible for you

19:10.800 --> 19:11.870
to be Lizzie's mother.

19:11.930 --> 19:13.625
You know,
I do look young.

19:13.670 --> 19:16.970
In fact, my own son almost
hit on me yesterday on campus.

19:17.020 --> 19:19.330
-It's a long story.
-I-I don't need to hear it.

19:19.370 --> 19:21.236
Okay.

19:21.290 --> 19:22.587
Hey, but look,
if -- if you want,

19:22.630 --> 19:24.678
I'll look into
how I can help.

19:24.720 --> 19:27.337
Aw. Diego, thank you.

19:37.690 --> 19:41.513
Dad...do you think
I'm a child?

19:41.570 --> 19:43.868
Not the best time
to ask that question.

19:46.050 --> 19:47.916
Mind if I have
some of your sundae?

19:47.960 --> 19:49.041
Way ahead of you.

19:49.100 --> 19:51.444
Ah!

19:51.490 --> 19:54.790
So...what is going on?

19:54.840 --> 19:57.275
Wes thinks all my ideas for
the bar are a waste of money.

19:57.320 --> 19:59.368
-No.

19:59.410 --> 20:00.844
But...

20:00.890 --> 20:02.756
I guess I did get
a little carried away

20:02.810 --> 20:05.324
and overspent a little.

20:05.370 --> 20:07.543
Like father, like son.

20:07.590 --> 20:09.900
I did the same thing
with your mom.

20:09.940 --> 20:13.240
When Stella was sick,
I did what I thought was right,

20:13.290 --> 20:17.818
but I didn't ask your mom what
she thought, which was wrong.

20:19.470 --> 20:22.349
That's not how
partnership works.

20:22.390 --> 20:25.473
But what if I'm right?

20:27.000 --> 20:29.264
Then you'll
convince him.

20:29.310 --> 20:31.483
Or you compromise.

20:31.530 --> 20:33.089
Or you end up alone.

20:33.140 --> 20:35.450
Yeah.

20:35.490 --> 20:38.664
Hey, I'm really
proud of you.

20:38.710 --> 20:40.269
And I don't want you
to screw this up

20:40.320 --> 20:43.711
because you're acting like me,
so talk to Wes.

20:43.760 --> 20:46.195
I will.
And for the record,

20:46.240 --> 20:49.289
acting like you wouldn't be
the worst thing in the world.

20:49.330 --> 20:51.025
Although, I'm gonna need you
to back off my sundae,

20:51.070 --> 20:52.287
"cause you're acting
like a pig.

20:52.330 --> 20:54.116
Aw, come on.

20:54.160 --> 20:55.764
No, go ahead.

20:58.600 --> 21:02.514
Okay, I just have
a few more errands to run.

21:02.560 --> 21:04.346
And then I will
meet you at the bar.

21:04.390 --> 21:07.439
Have you heard more from
Pippa about the investor?

21:07.480 --> 21:08.777
Not yet.

21:08.830 --> 21:11.049
And, Stella, I promise,
if she hadn't offered --

21:11.090 --> 21:14.435
It's fine. We're fine.
You heard what Miles said.

21:14.490 --> 21:17.528
We are fully committed and we
have nothing to be afraid of.

21:17.580 --> 21:19.924
Oh. I'm sorry, I'm getting
another call, though.

21:19.970 --> 21:21.745
Go.
I'll see you soon.

21:21.800 --> 21:23.484
Okay.

21:23.540 --> 21:25.190
Hello?
Dr. Grant: Hey.

21:25.240 --> 21:30.360
Uh, well, I'm sending up
the Bat-Signal.

21:30.410 --> 21:34.449
Uh, you got a second
to talk?

21:34.510 --> 21:35.807
What's up?

21:35.850 --> 21:40.947
Well, uh, my blood alcohol
level, for starters.

21:40.990 --> 21:42.242
Wait, I thought you were
supposed to be

21:42.300 --> 21:45.383
driving your parents
to the dedication.

21:45.430 --> 21:47.899
I'll let them take a cab.

21:47.950 --> 21:51.432
And, uh, I think
I'm gonna stay home.

21:51.480 --> 21:53.209
You don't
have to be there?

21:53.260 --> 21:57.481
I'm...supposed to present
a scholarship in Jesse's name.

21:57.530 --> 22:01.091
But with my parents there, it
just feels like another reminder

22:01.140 --> 22:02.926
of how damaged
we all are.

22:02.970 --> 22:06.759
Damage can be repaired, Will.
You're a doctor.

22:06.800 --> 22:09.053
You of all people
should know that.

22:11.330 --> 22:13.458
I have no idea
how to fix them.

22:15.420 --> 22:20.244
And I have no idea how I'm
gonna get through it.

22:20.290 --> 22:23.544
What would Jesse
have told you to do?

22:23.600 --> 22:24.817
He...

22:28.470 --> 22:31.201
He would have told me to quit
trying to make it all better

22:31.260 --> 22:33.774
and just...

22:33.830 --> 22:36.049
just be there.

22:36.090 --> 22:38.252
For them.

22:38.310 --> 22:39.562
For him.

22:40.750 --> 22:44.527
Sounds like he has
some pretty good advice.

22:44.580 --> 22:47.618
Yeah.
Yeah, he did.

22:49.890 --> 22:51.665
Hey, Stella, thank you.

22:53.540 --> 22:56.805
And, um,
good luck tonight.

22:58.550 --> 23:00.496
Yeah. You, too.

23:00.550 --> 23:02.245
Bye.

23:05.940 --> 23:08.420
You ready
for our big night?!

23:08.470 --> 23:10.336
Ready as I can be.

23:10.380 --> 23:12.428
Listen, I'm sorry
about the money.

23:12.470 --> 23:13.904
You're my partner,

23:13.950 --> 23:15.941
and I should have consulted you
about everything first.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.217
Thank you for saying that.

23:17.260 --> 23:19.251
And don't worry
about the money.

23:19.310 --> 23:22.211
We will find an investor
and get back on track.

23:22.270 --> 23:23.305
Not "we."

23:23.350 --> 23:24.954
I made this mess,
and I'll fix it.

23:25.010 --> 23:27.172
I'll find the investor.

23:27.230 --> 23:31.610
Look no further.
Here I am.

23:34.150 --> 23:36.573
See?
I'm really good at this.

23:36.630 --> 23:37.529
What are you doing here?

23:37.590 --> 23:39.718
I think I just said.

23:39.760 --> 23:41.273
Right, but --

23:41.330 --> 23:43.059
But nothing!

23:43.110 --> 23:44.805
Let us meet this angel.

23:44.850 --> 23:47.592
-Hi. I'm Aiden.
-Aiden.

23:47.640 --> 23:50.462
Aiden...this is Pippa.

23:50.510 --> 23:51.466
Who says what now?

23:57.130 --> 23:59.997
Thisis Pippa?

24:00.040 --> 24:02.953
PippaPippa?
ThePippa?

24:03.000 --> 24:05.526
I see my reputation
precedes me.

24:05.570 --> 24:07.959
I hope that's a good thing,
but I fear it isn't.

24:08.010 --> 24:11.708
Pippa, you -- you offered
to help me findan investor,

24:11.750 --> 24:13.479
not be the investor.

24:13.530 --> 24:16.704
Look, you need a 10K cash
infusion and a safety net.

24:16.750 --> 24:19.276
I'm offering that.

24:20.500 --> 24:21.717
Wow.

24:21.760 --> 24:23.580
She's offering that.

24:23.630 --> 24:24.847
Pippa, I --

24:24.890 --> 24:26.710
You know,
this is kind of thing

24:26.760 --> 24:28.671
that we should
probably consult about.

24:28.720 --> 24:29.892
Right, partner?

24:29.940 --> 24:32.250
Um, would you excuse us
for just one second?

24:35.730 --> 24:37.425
So...what do we think?

24:37.470 --> 24:38.858
Because generally speaking,
I make it a point

24:38.910 --> 24:40.730
not to look a gift hot chick
in the mouth.

24:40.780 --> 24:43.829
Yes, but going into business
with my ex-fiance,

24:43.870 --> 24:45.429
that could cause
some Serious issues.

24:45.480 --> 24:47.471
Especially since Pippa
is so crazy hot.

24:47.520 --> 24:49.864
Stella did know that Pippa
was planning on helping me,

24:49.920 --> 24:51.308
and she was fine with it.

24:51.350 --> 24:52.954
Plus, Pippa wouldn't have to
move here to invest.

24:53.010 --> 24:56.571
So maybe she could
be a silent partner?

24:56.620 --> 24:58.531
And being silent
will not prevent her

24:58.580 --> 24:59.741
from being
stupid hot.

24:59.800 --> 25:00.835
All right,
seriously, Aiden.

25:00.890 --> 25:04.440
Okay, look.
We don't need her money.

25:04.500 --> 25:05.922
Right. We don't.

25:05.980 --> 25:07.937
We can always find someone new
to invest the $10,000.

25:07.980 --> 25:12.372
Wow. Okay, that is
a big safety net.

25:12.420 --> 25:15.765
Ugh. Just looking at it
makes me feel calm.

25:15.810 --> 25:17.460
Still.

25:17.510 --> 25:18.727
Considering
the circumstances,

25:18.770 --> 25:20.374
probably best to find
someone else.

25:20.430 --> 25:22.467
Totally, and now we don't even
have to tell Stella

25:22.520 --> 25:23.646
about the offer at all,
right?

25:23.690 --> 25:25.772
Right.
Total non-issue.

25:28.740 --> 25:32.563
Hi. Look who I found here.
It's your new business partner.

25:32.610 --> 25:34.339
Actually, she's not.

25:34.400 --> 25:36.653
Aiden and I both really
appreciate the offer, Pippa,

25:36.700 --> 25:39.579
but, um,
we're not interested.

25:39.620 --> 25:40.792
Really?

25:40.840 --> 25:42.569
<i>I see
so much potential here,.</i>

25:42.620 --> 25:44.759
-We're sure.

25:44.800 --> 25:46.700
We're gonna find
another way.

25:46.760 --> 25:48.239
Well, I'm sorry
to hear that.

25:48.280 --> 25:49.668
I'm sorry you came
all this way for nothing.

25:49.720 --> 25:51.142
Well,
it's not for nothing.

25:51.200 --> 25:53.362
Stella was telling me
about her bone marrow drive,

25:53.420 --> 25:55.809
and I'd love to come tonight
and support the cause.

25:55.850 --> 25:58.672
Pippa was the last person
I wanted to come tonight,

25:58.730 --> 26:00.073
but she did have bone marrow.

26:00.120 --> 26:03.727
Great! Just don't forget
to bring those cheeks.

26:03.770 --> 26:05.113
Eh...You know
what I'm saying.

26:05.170 --> 26:07.593
I do.
I'll see you all tonight.

26:07.650 --> 26:10.688
And T'll leave this.
You never know.

26:14.050 --> 26:15.472
So, I'm guessing that was
a pretty good offer?

26:15.530 --> 26:16.952
It doesn't matter.

26:17.010 --> 26:18.660
Aiden and I both agree
that we do not need her money.

26:18.700 --> 26:20.350
We're gonna find
another way.

26:20.400 --> 26:23.483
All right, then I better
start getting ready, too.

26:23.530 --> 26:25.089
-Okay.
-Bye.

26:25.140 --> 26:27.142
Bye.

26:27.190 --> 26:29.181
-Hey.
-Hey.

26:29.230 --> 26:31.847
Hey, guys?
You, uh, need anything?

26:31.890 --> 26:34.496
Diego, good news!

26:34.540 --> 26:36.679
We just made room
for a new partner,

26:36.720 --> 26:40.065
and naturally, you're the
first person we thought of.

26:40.120 --> 26:42.373
All we need from you is a
small investment, and you're in.

26:42.420 --> 26:44.639
Finally!
Ah, come here!

26:44.690 --> 26:47.682
Oh!
I have been waiting

26:47.730 --> 26:49.209
for you guys to ask me
to be your partner!

26:49.250 --> 26:50.991
-Thank you!

26:51.040 --> 26:52.690
No. No. I can't do it.

26:52.740 --> 26:54.037
Wait, really?

26:54.090 --> 26:55.649
You just said you wanted
to be a partner.

26:55.700 --> 26:58.783
I wanted you to wantme
to be your partner.

26:58.830 --> 27:01.003
But I got kids
and a mortgage and --

27:01.050 --> 27:03.394
'Nough said.
I'll find someone else.

27:03.440 --> 27:06.705
Quick thought.
Uh, if I were your partner,

27:06.750 --> 27:10.709
I actually would spring
for a bar sign out front.

27:10.750 --> 27:12.058
I mean, how are people
gonna come in

27:12.100 --> 27:13.499
if they can't find
the place, right?

27:15.190 --> 27:17.887
Fine! Geez.
I'll put out a sign.

27:28.860 --> 27:32.205
Guys, there's a line
around the block!

27:33.950 --> 27:35.907
That's amazing!

27:35.950 --> 27:37.600
Very impressive,
gang.

27:37.650 --> 27:39.698
Let's do this,
shall we?

27:39.740 --> 27:41.344
Ooh, ooh, ooh

27:41.390 --> 27:43.654
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

27:43.700 --> 27:45.828
I see the way that you've
been looking at me

27:45.880 --> 27:49.225
You know that I got
what you wanted

27:49.270 --> 27:51.136
Think I gotta
let you know that we

27:51.190 --> 27:54.535
Were over the day
that we started

27:54.580 --> 27:56.571
It was coming on eventually

27:56.630 --> 27:59.531
The writing was on the wall

27:59.590 --> 28:05.711
And as soon as you move on

28:05.770 --> 28:07.898
We tried to dance

28:07.940 --> 28:10.898
And you didn't
wanna look uncool

28:10.950 --> 28:14.079
You took my hand, and I

28:14.120 --> 28:15.906
Put my trust in you

28:15.950 --> 28:18.078
Hi. Sign up for
the bone marrow registry?I don't think so.

28:18.130 --> 28:19.780
If you're a match,
you could save a life.

28:19.820 --> 28:20.867
Sorry.

28:20.910 --> 28:22.821
Thanks
for your compassion.

28:22.870 --> 28:25.180
Hey, Aiden?!

28:25.220 --> 28:26.437
This guy wants to take
our picture

28:26.480 --> 28:28.300
for the hospital
newsletter.

28:28.350 --> 28:29.397
Great place.

28:29.440 --> 28:30.657
I bet it catches on
like wildfire.

28:30.700 --> 28:32.839
We certainly hope so,
'cause if not...

28:32.880 --> 28:36.874
Hey, how are my
maybe

28:37.490 --> 28:38.798
Can I have a photo
of you three?

28:38.840 --> 28:40.797
Oh, no, she's not
our partner. At all.

28:40.840 --> 28:43.150
Well, she's still improving
the shot considerably.

28:43.190 --> 28:44.624
Sorry, darling,

28:44.670 --> 28:46.934
but you know
this is my good side.

28:48.200 --> 28:51.067
We had to reshoot
our engagement photos.

28:54.640 --> 28:56.984
I also do baby photos,
if you guys are in the market.

28:57.030 --> 29:01.945
Oh, no. Uh, I'm not his wife...
almost once, but not quite.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.298
That's his wife.
Stella?!

29:04.350 --> 29:05.511
Hmm?

29:07.610 --> 29:08.509
-Hi.
-Hi.

29:08.570 --> 29:10.561
-Nice to meet you.
-Yeah.

29:10.610 --> 29:11.827
Smile.

29:14.440 --> 29:16.169
Pippa, may I borrow you
for a moment?

29:16.230 --> 29:19.530
Yeah. Absolutely, Stella.
Anything for you.

29:21.710 --> 29:22.620
What can I do for you?

29:22.670 --> 29:23.922
For starters,
you can tell me

29:23.970 --> 29:25.711
what it is you're really
doing in Asheville.

29:25.760 --> 29:28.104
I'm sorry.
I'm not sure I understand.

29:28.150 --> 29:29.936
It's a simple question,
Pippa.

29:29.980 --> 29:31.493
Why are you here?

29:31.550 --> 29:33.154
Wes needed somebody
to help him,

29:33.200 --> 29:35.191
and I wanted to offer
to be that somebody.

29:35.250 --> 29:37.332
Look, if we're being
perfectly honest,

29:37.380 --> 29:38.859
the both of us know
that the real reason

29:38.900 --> 29:40.595
why you want to
invest in this bar

29:40.640 --> 29:43.860
is so that Wes will be back
in your life in a big way.

29:43.910 --> 29:47.164
I'm here because I want to help
a man I care deeply about.

29:47.220 --> 29:49.029
No. You can't do that.

29:49.090 --> 29:51.252
-Care. Deeply.

29:51.310 --> 29:53.916
I'm sorry, Stella,
but I already do.

29:53.960 --> 29:56.691
Wes and I grew up together.
He's practically family.

29:56.750 --> 29:59.788
And if I can help him,
I have to try.

29:59.840 --> 30:01.797
Or would you rather
I let him fail?

30:01.840 --> 30:03.660
Of course not.

30:03.710 --> 30:07.408
But you have to understand
you are not Wes' somebody.

30:07.450 --> 30:09.009
I am.

30:09.060 --> 30:12.018
Okay, and in a marriage, there's
only room for one somebody.

30:12.070 --> 30:14.414
Stella, hey.
Sorry for interrupting.

30:14.460 --> 30:16.633
Hi. I didn't know
you were gonna make it.

30:16.680 --> 30:20.799
Um, this is Pippa.
Wes' ex.

30:20.860 --> 30:22.077
Nice to meet you.

30:22.120 --> 30:23.076
Will Grant.

30:23.120 --> 30:25.031
Dr. Will Grant?

30:25.080 --> 30:26.070
That's right.

30:26.120 --> 30:29.340
I've heard
all about you.

30:29.390 --> 30:31.427
I'll let you two chat.

30:31.480 --> 30:33.209
-Pleasure.
-Pleasure.

30:33.260 --> 30:34.955
And that's when I realized,

30:35.000 --> 30:38.300
Pippa didn't need to work
her way into our marriage.

30:41.100 --> 30:43.489
Wes had already let her in.

30:43.530 --> 30:45.487
Sorry.
Will you excuse me?

30:47.140 --> 30:48.744
Yeah.

30:54.940 --> 30:56.544
Sorry,
but it's 21 and over.

30:56.590 --> 30:59.548
-I'm 24.
-Sure you are.

30:59.590 --> 31:01.149
Miles! Hi.

31:01.200 --> 31:03.635
Oh, this is our
couples counselor.

31:03.680 --> 31:05.990
I didn't know you were
still in couples therapy.

31:06.030 --> 31:07.589
They're not anymore.

31:07.640 --> 31:09.904
They keep quitting every time
they have a good session.

31:09.950 --> 31:12.032
Okay.
Well, uh, Miles,

31:12.080 --> 31:14.469
would you like to sign up
for the bone marrow registry?

31:14.520 --> 31:16.864
-Great.

31:22.570 --> 31:23.696
Peter!

31:24.530 --> 31:25.964
-Hey!
-This place is great!

31:26.010 --> 31:27.569
I know, right?
Here.

31:27.620 --> 31:29.133
I need to talk to you
about Ida.

31:29.190 --> 31:30.487
Is everything all right?

31:30.540 --> 31:32.053
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
She's fine.

31:32.100 --> 31:33.317
Uh, except that she wants
to go back to college

31:33.360 --> 31:35.101
and she can't afford it.

31:35.150 --> 31:38.142
I was thinking maybe you knew of
scholarships or financial aid.

31:38.200 --> 31:40.237
Why didn't she come
to me with this?

31:40.280 --> 31:41.896
I think she's
a little embarrassed.

31:41.940 --> 31:43.544
She left you to be
her own person.

31:43.590 --> 31:45.069
And now
she needs your help.

31:45.120 --> 31:47.987
And I can't imagine it feels
too good to know that.

31:52.430 --> 31:53.682
Hmm.

31:53.730 --> 31:55.812
You really don't have to
feel bad about the fact

31:55.870 --> 31:57.861
that this is harder than
you thought it would be.

31:57.910 --> 32:00.607
I just thought we were past all
these ridiculous trust issues.

32:00.650 --> 32:02.379
And what am I
still so afraid of?

32:02.440 --> 32:04.044
Maybe what scares you...

32:04.090 --> 32:08.049
is the thought that Wes could
feel the same way about Pippa

32:08.100 --> 32:09.784
that you feel
about Dr. Grant.

32:09.840 --> 32:13.003
I don't have those
feelings for Dr. Grant.

32:13.060 --> 32:14.095
Okay.

32:26.160 --> 32:28.936
Quick announcement.

32:28.990 --> 32:30.242
Girls drink free!

32:32.030 --> 32:36.069
...ly. Girls drink freely.
But also drink responsibly.

32:36.120 --> 32:37.849
And please pay for stuff.

32:40.610 --> 32:43.170
Peter.
Hi! Wow!

32:43.220 --> 32:44.301
You look handsome.

32:44.350 --> 32:46.864
Ida, you look...20.

32:46.920 --> 32:49.002
I could mistake you
for just another coed.

32:49.050 --> 32:50.563
Like father, like son.

32:50.620 --> 32:52.918
There's just something
about being around them.

32:52.970 --> 32:55.837
It makes me feel like
I never left school.

32:55.880 --> 32:57.439
Then you should go back.

32:57.490 --> 32:58.707
Oh, yeah, I already
looked into it.

32:58.750 --> 33:00.058
Unfortunately,
I can't afford it.

33:00.100 --> 33:01.443
You can.

33:01.500 --> 33:04.663
Turns out, as the wife
of a college professor,

33:04.720 --> 33:07.234
you can attend the
university tuition-free.

33:07.280 --> 33:09.021
Really?
But wait a minute.

33:09.070 --> 33:11.630
Wait, wait. We're divorced.
You just filed the paperwork.

33:11.680 --> 33:14.024
I haven't.
Not yet.

33:14.070 --> 33:17.119
And I won't, if you
really want to do this.

33:17.160 --> 33:18.241
Well, what about Gina?

33:18.300 --> 33:19.722
I thought
this was important to her.

33:19.780 --> 33:20.906
It is.

33:20.950 --> 33:24.511
But your happiness
is important to me.

33:24.560 --> 33:27.951
And if Gina really is the woman
for me, she'll understand.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.220
You've supported me
through 30 years of marriage.

33:31.270 --> 33:34.080
<i>- _Theleast1lcan do
is give you a few semesters.</i>

33:36.530 --> 33:38.874
Is that
a habanero martini?

33:38.920 --> 33:40.092
Yes.

33:40.140 --> 33:41.665
But I liked these
way before I met you.

33:41.710 --> 33:43.883
Hmm. I thought we weren't
gonna lie to each other.

33:43.930 --> 33:46.979
Right. Oh, I'm -- I'm sorry
I ran off earlier.

33:47.020 --> 33:48.328
How was the dedication?

33:48.370 --> 33:51.237
Ah. It was like
a slow-motion train wreck.

33:51.290 --> 33:52.849
Oh, no. Seriously?
Yeah.

33:52.900 --> 33:55.289
But based on some good advice
that I got earlier,

33:55.330 --> 33:58.152
I decided to forget
about my insane family

33:58.210 --> 34:01.248
and focus on the kid
who got the scholarship.

34:01.300 --> 34:04.338
I'm glad I went.
Thank you.

34:04.390 --> 34:06.074
That was all
Jesse's advice.

34:06.130 --> 34:11.387
No, Stella, I needed somebody,
and you were there for me, so...

34:13.920 --> 34:15.649
-Thank you for coming.
-Yeah.

34:15.699 --> 34:17.485
Yeah. And thank you
for your DNA.

34:17.530 --> 34:18.952
Mmm.
Please don't clone me.

34:19.010 --> 34:21.445
I'm pretty sure one of you
is more than enough.

34:23.190 --> 34:25.147
So the turnout's
amazing.

34:25.190 --> 34:27.147
Yeah, there's a lot
of people here,

34:27.190 --> 34:28.965
but turns out
that 20-somethings

34:29.020 --> 34:30.748
would rather
drink themselves blind

34:30.800 --> 34:33.143
than sign up for a potentially
invasive medical procedure.

34:33.199 --> 34:34.975
And this is news to you?

34:35.020 --> 34:37.239
In fairness, I haven't
had much experience

34:37.290 --> 34:39.327
being a typical
20-something.

34:39.380 --> 34:41.109
So how many more
donors do you need?

34:41.159 --> 34:42.672
A lot.

34:53.520 --> 34:57.525
Um, hey, how cool
is this place, right?

35:00.570 --> 35:02.698
-I don't know.

35:02.750 --> 35:04.002
But if he starts singing,

35:04.050 --> 35:05.870
I'm gonna burn
this bar to the ground.

35:05.920 --> 35:08.230
Does anyone out here drink gin?
Huh

35:08.280 --> 35:10.271
There they are!
There's my people!

35:10.320 --> 35:13.711
So, I, uh --
I started drinking gin, um,

35:13.760 --> 35:16.536
because my older brother, Jesse,
he -- he told me that --

35:16.590 --> 35:18.718
that James Bond was
the coolest guy ever.

35:18.760 --> 35:20.319
And I-I thought
that my older brother

35:20.370 --> 35:24.546
was the coolest guy ever,
so, well...here I am.

35:28.950 --> 35:31.988
Drinking gin alone.

35:32.040 --> 35:35.556
I would give anything if --
if Jesse was here tonight.

35:35.610 --> 35:39.433
He would love this place.
He would.

35:39.480 --> 35:41.790
But he's not here.

35:41.830 --> 35:47.394
Because he -- he died three
weeks before his 21st birthday.

35:48.450 --> 35:50.396
Um...

35:52.360 --> 35:55.239
He had cancer, and he --

35:55.280 --> 35:58.409
he needed
a bone marrow transplant,

35:58.460 --> 36:00.235
and I-I'll never forget
the day that I-I went

36:00.280 --> 36:03.102
to get tested to see
if I was a match.

36:06.030 --> 36:10.979
But I wasn't a match and, uh --
and I couldn't save his life.

36:11.030 --> 36:14.989
But -- But maybe someone
in this room could have.

36:15.040 --> 36:18.340
So if you haven't
gotten swabbed yet,

36:18.390 --> 36:23.783
please...be the hero
that I know you can be.

36:23.830 --> 36:25.127
And if you don't want to do it

36:25.180 --> 36:27.649
for some guy up here
drinking gin,

36:27.700 --> 36:31.876
then -- then do it
for my brother.

36:31.920 --> 36:33.354
Thank you guys.
Cheers!

36:41.370 --> 36:43.020
That was some speech.

36:44.240 --> 36:46.891
I guess Dr. Grant's
still in the picture.

36:46.940 --> 36:48.453
He's not.

36:48.510 --> 36:51.150
And I should never have talked
to you about that whole thing.

36:51.200 --> 36:54.022
You don't want to take my money.
I get that.

36:54.080 --> 36:57.300
But it's me. _
You can always tell me anything.

36:57.340 --> 37:01.470
No, Pip, I can't.
Not anymore.

37:14.360 --> 37:16.351
Will!

37:16.400 --> 37:18.744
Will?!

37:18.800 --> 37:20.666
Hey.

37:20.710 --> 37:22.929
That was some speech.

37:22.970 --> 37:26.326
I really thought I could
keep it together, but...

37:28.460 --> 37:30.451
I'm a mess today.

37:30.500 --> 37:33.288
Well, thank you.

37:33.330 --> 37:36.379
And just so you know,
you are a hero...

37:36.420 --> 37:42.075
to that kid you helped today, to
the kids you help every day...

37:42.120 --> 37:43.463
to me.

37:44.910 --> 37:50.952
And if you miss your brother,
it's okay to be a mess.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.343
It's okay.

37:52.400 --> 37:54.346
It's just a little white lie

37:54.400 --> 37:58.041
If it is all the same to me

37:58.100 --> 38:00.523
And it's just
a little white lie

38:00.580 --> 38:04.539
If I was to blame you

38:06.190 --> 38:08.101
Would you...

38:08.150 --> 38:09.140
What was that?

38:12.110 --> 38:13.418
What was that?

38:13.460 --> 38:16.100
I...I don't --
I don't know.

38:16.160 --> 38:17.889
I-I didn't mean it
to happen that way.

38:17.940 --> 38:21.114
So you did
want it to happen?

38:21.160 --> 38:24.460
Yeah. Of course I wanted it
to happen, but...not now.

38:24.510 --> 38:26.854
No. Not ever.

38:26.910 --> 38:29.299
What?I'm serious. I mean it.

38:30.430 --> 38:34.048
Okay, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go home now.

38:42.620 --> 38:45.009
Wes! There he is!
We need to celebrate!

38:45.060 --> 38:48.360
Let me watch you do
a couple...shots.

38:48.410 --> 38:49.889
Hey. Are you okay?

38:49.930 --> 38:52.149
I promise I'll figure out
the money stuff.

38:52.190 --> 38:55.490
But tonight, we just
got to enjoy this.

38:55.550 --> 38:58.770
Sorry.
I got to get out of here.

39:00.640 --> 39:02.244
What

39:11.170 --> 39:13.036
Can't believe
the kid who framed

39:13.080 --> 39:15.560
his Least Likely to Succeed
award

39:15.610 --> 39:16.953
is a business owner.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.469
And, by the way, everything
that Aiden is doing

39:19.530 --> 39:21.259
is because of you.

39:21.310 --> 39:24.223
It's because of us.

39:24.270 --> 39:25.442
To us.

39:27.140 --> 39:29.097
[ Mid-tempo music plays,
indistinct singing]

39:30.670 --> 39:32.365
You remember this?

39:32.410 --> 39:35.311
This is the first song
that we ever danced to.

39:35.370 --> 39:38.010
At that sorority mixer
you made me go to.

39:38.070 --> 39:39.799
Yes.

39:39.850 --> 39:42.717
You really missed out
not being bi in college.

39:42.770 --> 39:44.374
No, I didn't.

39:46.600 --> 39:49.240
It's been 100 years since
the last time I asked you this,

39:49.290 --> 39:54.512
but, Ida Kaminsky,
would you like to dance with me?

39:54.560 --> 39:56.119
I'd love to.

40:13.230 --> 40:16.097
Elaine. Hi.
Have you seen my husband?

40:16.150 --> 40:19.586
No, but I have signed up a lot
of people for the registry.

40:19.630 --> 40:21.587
You did a great job.

40:21.630 --> 40:24.850
You make people care, Stella.
It's a strength.

40:24.900 --> 40:26.846
Why does it feel
like a weakness?

40:26.900 --> 40:28.504
-Nothing.

40:28.550 --> 40:31.941
I'm sorry. I just --
I need to find Wes.

40:34.210 --> 40:35.518
Wes, would you
please stop walking?

40:35.560 --> 40:37.517
Would you please
stop following me?

40:37.560 --> 40:39.517
I'm worried about you.
What's going on?

40:39.560 --> 40:41.289
Wes?

40:46.740 --> 40:49.823
Well, I'm thinking
to myself again

40:49.880 --> 40:52.656
Am I always on
the losing end?

40:52.710 --> 40:55.532
You never called back,
you never called back

40:55.580 --> 40:58.572
Well, that's okay, 'cause
I don't talk like that

40:58.630 --> 41:01.884
Wes? Now, I'm waiting
for my time to come

41:01.930 --> 41:04.581
And I know
I'm not the only one

41:04.630 --> 41:07.804
I'll never hold back,
I'll never hold back

41:07.850 --> 41:10.581
Hey, it's me again.
I'm just checking in.

41:10.640 --> 41:12.119
I-I lost track
of you at the bar

41:12.160 --> 41:13.935
and I'm really starting
to get worried,

41:13.990 --> 41:17.506
so just call me back, okay?

41:17.560 --> 41:20.257
"Cause I know
it would be good for you

41:20.300 --> 41:22.644
Talk to me. You don't know,
then I'll show you

41:22.690 --> 41:25.864
Let me show you how

41:25.910 --> 41:28.436
Will you show me how

41:28.480 --> 41:30.790
So meet me in the middle
sometime
