WEBVTT

00:12.762 --> 00:14.681
There's no sign of Superman
in Park Ridge or Midtown.

00:14.681 --> 00:16.349
Steve, Cat and Ronnie
agreed to call

00:16.349 --> 00:17.726
if their contacts
see something.

00:17.726 --> 00:21.062
- Anything on Flamebird?
- Nothing.

00:21.062 --> 00:23.648
It's like he disappeared
off the face of the Earth.

00:23.648 --> 00:25.525
Which is why we're here.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.945
Nobody knows the streets
of Metropolis

00:28.945 --> 00:30.488
better than the <i>Newskid</i> Legion.

00:30.488 --> 00:32.282
<i>Big Words brought
the walkie talkies.</i>

00:32.282 --> 00:33.867
<i>Gaby made missing posters.</i>

00:33.867 --> 00:36.244
<i>Even Patti is helping.</i>

00:36.244 --> 00:38.163
Flip, it's too dangerous.

00:38.163 --> 00:40.373
- Go home, okay?
- I can't.

00:40.373 --> 00:42.417
We can't.

00:42.417 --> 00:44.210
Superman saved me.

00:45.879 --> 00:49.007
Look, I don't know why
those people want to hurt him.

00:49.007 --> 00:51.301
And it's weird and scary now.

00:51.301 --> 00:54.095
But when I think
of helping Superman,

00:54.095 --> 00:58.808
like he helped me,
I don't feel so small.

00:58.808 --> 01:01.269
So, are we doing this or what?

01:04.397 --> 01:06.232
Okay. Give us a walkie.

01:06.232 --> 01:10.487
Yes. We'll find him
and everything will be okay.

01:10.487 --> 01:11.571
You'll see.

01:24.459 --> 01:26.044
Hello, Superman.

01:55.990 --> 01:57.909
Where am I?

01:59.702 --> 02:03.623
You're not going
to punch your way
out of this one, Superman.

02:03.623 --> 02:05.542
Now I need dates and numbers.

02:05.542 --> 02:08.878
What... what dates? I--

02:12.423 --> 02:13.883
When is the invasion?

02:13.883 --> 02:16.052
How many of your kind
will come through this time?

02:17.137 --> 02:18.263
This time?

02:18.263 --> 02:21.182
You've... you've met
others like me?

02:21.182 --> 02:22.517
When?

02:22.517 --> 02:24.644
After everything
you've done to us,

02:24.644 --> 02:26.437
you dare still pretend

02:26.437 --> 02:28.731
that you're the
innocent one here?

02:28.731 --> 02:31.234
I don't know what
you're talking about.

02:31.234 --> 02:33.194
I've lived on Earth
my whole life.

02:33.194 --> 02:34.404
Stop lying!

02:34.404 --> 02:37.782
I was there on Zero Day,
and so were you.

02:52.672 --> 02:54.090
All right, listen up.

02:54.090 --> 02:57.844
Seventy-two hours ago,
an unidentified flying object

02:57.844 --> 02:59.345
broke through the atmosphere...

02:59.345 --> 03:01.598
- Sam, where are you?
- ...and touched down here.

03:01.598 --> 03:06.644
This is a
Division One classified site,
and you're here to secure it.

03:06.644 --> 03:10.023
I'll be home soon. I promise.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.649
- I can't believe you.
- Whoa!

03:11.649 --> 03:13.192
Uh, hey Mandy.

03:13.192 --> 03:14.611
Don't "Mandy" me!

03:14.611 --> 03:17.030
You snuck into the command tent
to make a call!

03:17.030 --> 03:19.908
What part of
"Top Secret mission"
did you not get?

03:19.908 --> 03:24.412
I guess, based on my actions,
the top secret part?

03:24.412 --> 03:25.371
I'm gonna kill you.

03:25.371 --> 03:26.873
Come on, Waller,

03:26.873 --> 03:29.292
it's been three days of staring
at a hole in the ground.

03:29.292 --> 03:32.337
You can't tell me this is what
you imagined when we enlisted.

03:32.337 --> 03:34.547
Serving my country
without question?

03:34.547 --> 03:36.090
Uh, yes, it is.

03:36.090 --> 03:39.302
Besides, this is important.

03:39.302 --> 03:40.803
So is this mission.

03:40.803 --> 03:42.764
Get your head in the game.

03:42.764 --> 03:45.934
You know, one day I'm not going
to be around to pull you
out of trouble.

05:02.593 --> 05:03.428
Huh?

05:25.825 --> 05:27.243
Every moment...

05:27.243 --> 05:30.496
I've spent every moment
of the past 22 years

05:30.496 --> 05:32.999
seeing this when
I close my eyes.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.792
Putting everything aside,

05:34.792 --> 05:39.756
sacrificing everything,
in order to prepare Earth
for your return.

05:39.756 --> 05:43.134
But I wasn't going to let us
be taken by surprise again.

05:43.134 --> 05:45.136
I created Task Force X.

05:45.136 --> 05:46.846
I took the tech
you left behind

05:46.846 --> 05:49.348
and turned your
weapons into ours.

05:49.348 --> 05:50.933
I made the hard calls.

05:50.933 --> 05:52.810
So that when your people
came back to finish

05:52.810 --> 05:55.229
what they started,
we would be ready.

05:55.229 --> 05:59.317
And then you showed up,
passing yourself off as a hero.

05:59.317 --> 06:01.611
When we both know what you are.

06:01.611 --> 06:03.404
A weapon!

06:03.404 --> 06:06.532
So you're going to tell me
everything you know.

06:06.532 --> 06:07.575
Who are you?

06:07.575 --> 06:08.910
And why are you on Earth?

06:10.828 --> 06:11.913
I, I don't know.

06:11.913 --> 06:13.206
I always thought that...

06:15.333 --> 06:18.002
Why...
why would they do this?

06:21.214 --> 06:23.382
This is Jimmy.
He's not at the docks.

06:23.382 --> 06:24.801
Have you found anything?

06:24.801 --> 06:27.553
Nothing in Bakerline
or around the bay.

06:27.553 --> 06:29.013
<i>But we'll keep looking.</i>

06:29.013 --> 06:30.014
<i>Over and out.</i>

06:32.517 --> 06:34.644
- Hey. You okay?
- No.

06:34.644 --> 06:37.939
Jimmy, I said awful
things to Clark.

06:37.939 --> 06:40.525
I doubted him when
he needed us most.

06:40.525 --> 06:43.569
I was wrong and now
he's gone and...

06:43.569 --> 06:45.321
And we are going to find him.

06:46.572 --> 06:47.865
Right?

06:49.575 --> 06:51.160
Of course.

06:51.160 --> 06:54.580
No!
You can't do this to me!

06:54.580 --> 06:57.834
You promised me Superman!

06:57.834 --> 07:00.545
He took everything from me!

07:00.545 --> 07:02.421
But I am not finished with him!

07:02.421 --> 07:04.173
I don't want to cage him.

07:04.173 --> 07:06.551
- I want him to suffer!
- Shut up!

07:11.848 --> 07:12.890
What?

07:23.401 --> 07:27.697
Superman's power level
remains suppressed
throughout your interrogation.

07:27.697 --> 07:29.866
The parasite collar
and Cadmus omega field

07:29.866 --> 07:31.993
are working in
conjunction perfectly.

07:31.993 --> 07:34.996
Seems Ivo lives up
to his own hype.

07:34.996 --> 07:37.248
Too bad he's going insane.

07:37.248 --> 07:42.628
Still, we can get some more
use out of him before
he completely loses it.

07:42.628 --> 07:44.839
We've spent so much
time guessing

07:44.839 --> 07:48.217
about why Nemesis
Omega attacked.

07:48.217 --> 07:52.263
And when it seems like
we finally have the answers
in our grasp...

07:53.806 --> 07:55.141
What if we're wrong?

07:56.017 --> 07:58.019
Tamp that talk down now.

07:58.019 --> 08:01.272
Task Force X
doesn't make mistakes.

08:01.272 --> 08:03.482
If his people age like us,

08:03.482 --> 08:06.027
he's too young to have been
part of Zero Day.

08:06.027 --> 08:08.404
- If he's innocent--
- Innocent?

08:08.404 --> 08:10.990
And what were our friends
who were slaughtered guilty of?

08:10.990 --> 08:14.076
We, the only survivors
haven't made a mistake.

08:14.076 --> 08:15.995
Superman is an invader.

08:15.995 --> 08:18.581
And if he's compromised
your commitment...

08:18.581 --> 08:20.249
then it's time to
get rid of him.

08:20.249 --> 08:22.835
We need information
more than revenge.

08:22.835 --> 08:26.214
The only information we need
is how to take his kind down.

08:26.214 --> 08:28.090
Get your head in the game.

08:28.090 --> 08:30.885
If you can't do it,
then we turn him over to Ivo.

08:30.885 --> 08:32.345
No!

08:32.345 --> 08:35.139
Are you having doubts
because of something real,

08:35.139 --> 08:37.892
or is it because Superman
reminds you of her?

08:37.892 --> 08:41.103
Think hard about
what you say next.

08:41.103 --> 08:44.524
I am. And if you can't
make the right call,

08:44.524 --> 08:49.070
then you're not
the man I followed
for the last 22 years.

08:49.070 --> 08:51.948
We're keeping Superman alive
for questioning.

08:51.948 --> 08:54.617
It's my call, not yours.

08:54.617 --> 08:55.826
Dismissed.

08:56.494 --> 08:57.787
Hmm.

09:04.961 --> 09:06.754
Camera's off.

09:23.896 --> 09:26.482
Hey. You still want
to take down Superman?

09:43.124 --> 09:45.501
Rematch time, Superman!

09:45.501 --> 09:48.129
No more constraints.
No more collars.

09:48.129 --> 09:52.883
Just you and me,
and the beatdown
of the century, buddy.

09:52.883 --> 09:55.219
Let's see what
the Man of Steel's got!

09:56.637 --> 09:58.180
I don't wanna hurt you.

09:58.180 --> 10:00.266
Hurt me?

10:00.266 --> 10:04.812
The only reason
you won last time
is because you cheated!

10:04.812 --> 10:06.439
You don't hurt me.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.774
I hurt you!

10:12.695 --> 10:14.071
What...

10:15.448 --> 10:17.992
Wilson! Waller! Code orange!

10:20.036 --> 10:21.996
If you're trying
to trick me like last time,

10:21.996 --> 10:24.040
it's not going to work.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.042
I don't need your power.

10:29.045 --> 10:31.881
There's power everywhere!

10:33.341 --> 10:36.010
What do you say now, cheater?

10:36.010 --> 10:37.887
I won't fight you, Ivo.

10:37.887 --> 10:41.098
I don't... I never
wanted to fight anyone.

10:41.098 --> 10:43.059
I only wanted to help.

10:43.059 --> 10:45.561
Well, then I guess
you're just gonna die.

10:45.561 --> 10:46.854
Ivo!

10:47.688 --> 10:50.566
Stand down. Now.

10:50.566 --> 10:53.069
No! He's mine.

10:58.741 --> 10:59.867
Ahhh!

11:05.873 --> 11:07.833
Open fire on my command.

11:10.795 --> 11:12.546
Yeah, I don't think so.

11:33.067 --> 11:35.444
Bye-bye, Black Ops.

11:42.701 --> 11:46.664
Clark...
Clark! Where are you?

11:47.873 --> 11:48.833
Lois?

12:01.387 --> 12:03.097
Well, this has been fun.

12:03.097 --> 12:04.890
But we've got places to be.

12:30.791 --> 12:31.750
Superman!

12:31.750 --> 12:33.335
We found him! We found him!

12:33.335 --> 12:35.588
We're at 47th and... Whoa!

12:37.131 --> 12:38.048
Flip...

12:38.048 --> 12:39.425
It's not safe.

12:39.425 --> 12:40.926
Leave me.

12:42.219 --> 12:43.679
I've got him, everyone.

12:43.679 --> 12:46.432
Meet us back at
the <i>Newskid</i> clubhouse.

12:55.649 --> 12:58.486
- Clark.
- Are you okay?

12:58.486 --> 12:59.653
Clark?

13:02.031 --> 13:05.743
Lois.
Remember when you
asked me who I was?

13:06.869 --> 13:08.746
Why I'm here?

13:08.746 --> 13:10.706
I finally have
an answer for you.

13:11.707 --> 13:13.209
I'm a weapon.

13:13.209 --> 13:15.920
I'm an alien invader
sent to kill you all.

13:15.920 --> 13:18.380
No! You would
never hurt anyone.

13:18.380 --> 13:19.632
You help people.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.217
I saw it, Jimmy!

13:21.217 --> 13:23.719
The day my people sent me
here to invade Earth,

13:23.719 --> 13:27.056
I saw my spaceship
come through with an armada.

13:27.056 --> 13:29.016
And it makes sense.

13:29.016 --> 13:33.395
Why else would I be able
to shoot fire from my eyes,
to rip apart steel?

13:33.395 --> 13:36.398
I'm made for destruction.

13:37.733 --> 13:39.527
The Earth's
better off without me.

13:40.986 --> 13:42.112
No.

13:42.112 --> 13:43.531
I won't accept that.

13:44.323 --> 13:45.407
You're not a weapon.

13:45.407 --> 13:47.535
You're a person.

14:15.187 --> 14:20.234
Superman! Come out,
come out, wherever you are.

14:21.235 --> 14:24.446
Or I'll make you come to me.

14:27.783 --> 14:29.326
This is all my fault.

14:29.326 --> 14:32.162
My people brought
these weapons here.

14:32.162 --> 14:33.956
I'm the only one
who can stop him.

14:35.249 --> 14:37.751
Clark! You can't beat him
in your condition,

14:37.751 --> 14:41.922
and he's just getting stronger
with every building
he drains and...

14:41.922 --> 14:43.340
People are getting hurt, Lois.

14:44.300 --> 14:45.342
I...

14:46.802 --> 14:48.012
I have to try.

14:55.060 --> 14:56.478
Wait...

15:14.747 --> 15:17.458
Took you... long enough.

15:17.458 --> 15:21.545
Do whatever you want with me,
but leave the people
of Metropolis out of--

15:24.131 --> 15:26.508
How about... no!

15:28.260 --> 15:30.721
What?

15:33.557 --> 15:34.600
More power!

15:38.479 --> 15:40.022
I need more!

15:40.022 --> 15:41.357
More!

16:02.544 --> 16:04.380
No, no, no, no.

16:04.380 --> 16:05.964
We have to help.

16:05.964 --> 16:07.132
How do we help?

16:09.426 --> 16:10.761
I have an idea.

16:12.846 --> 16:13.889
<i>Hi, Birdwatchers.</i>

16:13.889 --> 16:15.265
<i>You know me as Flamebird.</i>

16:15.265 --> 16:17.935
<i>But my real name
is Jimmy Olsen.</i>

16:17.935 --> 16:19.561
<i>Superman's best friend.</i>

16:19.561 --> 16:22.773
<i>And I'm Lois Lane,
Superman's...</i>

16:22.773 --> 16:25.275
<i>A reporter for
the</i> Daily Planet.

16:25.275 --> 16:27.194
<i>Metropolis is under attack.</i>

16:27.194 --> 16:30.030
<i>Superman is out there
right now defending us.</i>

16:30.030 --> 16:32.074
<i>But he can't do this
on his own.</i>

16:32.074 --> 16:35.703
<i>When I first met Superman,
I didn't know how to feel.</i>

16:35.703 --> 16:40.541
<i>He was stronger than us,
faster, more powerful.</i>

16:40.541 --> 16:43.419
<i>And every single day,
he went out there,</i>

16:43.419 --> 16:46.171
<i>and used that power to help us.</i>

16:46.171 --> 16:51.218
<i>People have told you
to fear Superman because
he's different from us.</i>

16:51.218 --> 16:55.681
<i>But we humans are capable
of causing hurt and pain too.</i>

16:55.681 --> 16:57.141
<i>Because of greed.</i>

16:59.184 --> 17:03.147
<i>Because we want to punish those
who don't look or act like us.</i>

17:04.481 --> 17:07.025
<i>Because of fear.</i>

17:07.025 --> 17:12.114
<i>But we're also
capable of greatness.</i>

17:12.114 --> 17:15.826
<i>It's what we choose
to do that matters.</i>

17:15.826 --> 17:18.037
Superman's made his choice.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.872
It's our turn, Metropolis.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.957
So please, turn off your power.

17:21.957 --> 17:23.667
Shut off your
building's breakers,

17:23.667 --> 17:25.127
your generators,

17:25.127 --> 17:27.963
do anything you can
to starve Parasite of energy.

17:27.963 --> 17:31.633
Superman has saved this city
over and over again.

17:31.633 --> 17:34.136
<i>It's time for us
to save Superman.</i>

17:37.848 --> 17:41.059
You lose!

17:47.524 --> 17:48.942
<i>Come on, Superman.</i>

17:48.942 --> 17:50.861
<i>Honey, turn off the lights.</i>

17:50.861 --> 17:52.905
<i>We have to help Superman!</i>

17:54.782 --> 17:56.450
<i>Mom, I'm scared.</i>

17:58.452 --> 18:00.329
<i>Superman will save us.</i>

18:12.257 --> 18:13.509
What did you do?

18:13.509 --> 18:15.177
You did something!

18:15.177 --> 18:17.262
You cheated again!

18:22.684 --> 18:24.353
Dr. Ivo,
I know you're in there.

18:24.353 --> 18:26.021
Please stand down.

18:26.021 --> 18:28.774
I won't let you hurt
the people of this city

18:28.774 --> 18:30.859
or anyone ever again.

18:30.859 --> 18:33.987
You aren't the hero here!

18:33.987 --> 18:36.406
You're not even human!

18:36.406 --> 18:39.868
You turned me into a monster!

18:45.415 --> 18:47.876
You chose to be a monster, Ivo.

18:47.876 --> 18:52.589
Then what
does that make
an alien freak like you?

18:55.384 --> 18:56.260
Huh?

18:59.847 --> 19:00.973
Don't you read the paper?

19:08.605 --> 19:10.190
I'm Superman.

19:24.746 --> 19:26.498
Yay! He did it!

19:26.498 --> 19:27.583
We did it!

19:48.020 --> 19:49.521
Clark!

19:49.521 --> 19:51.440
I'm okay.
I'm okay, Jimmy.

19:51.440 --> 19:52.900
Of course you are.

19:52.900 --> 19:55.110
Get used to me being
right here because

19:55.110 --> 19:57.613
I am never letting you
go again, buddy.

20:02.951 --> 20:04.620
Oh, uh, hmm...

20:06.872 --> 20:08.165
I heard everything you said.

20:09.041 --> 20:11.543
- Lois, I--
- I know.

20:11.543 --> 20:13.211
I meant every word.

20:13.211 --> 20:15.631
The world is better
with you in it.

20:15.631 --> 20:18.300
My world is better
with you in it.

20:21.219 --> 20:24.181
So don't ever worry me
like that again, Smallville.

20:24.932 --> 20:26.642
I love you. And--

20:35.776 --> 20:36.902
I love you, too.

20:42.574 --> 20:43.825
Hmm?

20:48.830 --> 20:50.499
Huh?

20:59.257 --> 21:00.550
Waller.

21:00.550 --> 21:02.344
We need to talk, General.

21:02.344 --> 21:04.262
About Superman.

21:04.262 --> 21:08.183
We? There is no "we" here.

21:08.183 --> 21:12.354
It was my call
what to do with him,
and it's still my call.

21:12.354 --> 21:13.855
Not anymore.

21:13.855 --> 21:16.066
Our superiors have been
displeased at your failure

21:16.066 --> 21:18.360
to take lethal action
against the invader.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.487
At the cost of civilian lives!

21:20.487 --> 21:22.739
And what do you call
what happened today?

21:26.702 --> 21:28.996
As of now,
I am authorized by Checkmate

21:28.996 --> 21:33.583
and the Government
of the United States of America
to relieve you of your duties.

21:33.583 --> 21:36.503
You are no longer head
of Task Force X.

21:37.587 --> 21:38.630
I am.

21:40.674 --> 21:42.467
Oh, and General?

21:42.467 --> 21:45.929
From now on,
we're taking a different track
in regards to Superman.

21:46.763 --> 21:48.724
Ivo's last invention.

21:49.558 --> 21:51.560
The Omega Cannon.

21:51.560 --> 21:55.522
It should weaken
the alien enough for you
to carry out your new mission.

21:55.522 --> 21:59.067
Track down
and terminate Superman.
