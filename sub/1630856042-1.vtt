WEBVTT

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.400
There's only one here.

00:02:21.745 --> 00:02:23.167
They were forged as a pair.

00:02:23.292 --> 00:02:26.128
We'll keep looking for it.
It must be buried elsewhere.

00:02:26.206 --> 00:02:27.382
Elsewhere?

00:02:29.658 --> 00:02:30.697
Like where?

00:02:45.198 --> 00:02:48.722
Kamala! Are you doing
your homework, beta?

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.956
Yeah! Science!

00:03:00.026 --> 00:03:01.284
Boom!

00:03:01.441 --> 00:03:03.316
Enter, Kamala Khan.

00:03:03.378 --> 00:03:04.452
Ready for...

00:03:05.085 --> 00:03:07.388
Captain Marvel.

00:03:08.612 --> 00:03:09.624
She needs my help.

00:03:10.307 --> 00:03:12.487
Shine on, baby.

00:03:16.081 --> 00:03:18.316
Ugh! Why are hands
so hard to draw?

00:03:18.534 --> 00:03:21.654
Okay, Ms. Marvel arrives,
and just in time,

00:03:21.679 --> 00:03:23.538
'cause even the Avengers
need backup, ya know?

00:03:23.571 --> 00:03:25.138
Wham! Kapow!

00:03:27.763 --> 00:03:30.077
This is my chance!

00:03:32.998 --> 00:03:34.123
Pow!

00:03:35.662 --> 00:03:36.752
Boom!

00:03:38.197 --> 00:03:39.433
Not bad, kid.

00:03:41.279 --> 00:03:42.349
What's your name?

00:03:42.443 --> 00:03:43.858
Ms. Marvel.

00:03:43.892 --> 00:03:44.926
Dude.

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.059
Twinsies!

00:03:47.638 --> 00:03:49.629
Hey, you wanna go party
with the Avengers?

00:03:49.654 --> 00:03:51.677
Uh... Yeah!

00:03:51.982 --> 00:03:53.810
Oh, uh, can you fly?

00:03:53.873 --> 00:03:56.857
No, but, um, I can do this!

00:03:58.037 --> 00:03:59.059
Kamala!

00:03:59.084 --> 00:04:01.108
Don't make me come up there!

00:04:02.623 --> 00:04:04.479
That does not sound
like science to me.

00:04:04.512 --> 00:04:05.599
Okay.

00:04:29.146 --> 00:04:31.185
You don't remember anything?

00:04:31.893 --> 00:04:33.528
I see...

00:04:33.929 --> 00:04:35.196
flashes.

00:04:37.216 --> 00:04:38.588
Little moments.

00:04:38.818 --> 00:04:41.826
If I could just piece together
what happened that morning,

00:04:41.983 --> 00:04:44.084
maybe it'll all make sense.

00:04:53.224 --> 00:04:56.810
You stole me from my home,
my family, my friends.

00:04:56.857 --> 00:04:58.333
Lieutenant Trouble.

00:04:58.607 --> 00:04:59.966
Higher, further, faster, baby.

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:01.162
That's right.

00:05:01.459 --> 00:05:04.104
Tell the Supreme Intelligence
that I'm coming to end it.

00:05:04.787 --> 00:05:07.365
The war, the lies.

00:05:07.591 --> 00:05:10.044
- All of it.
- You can't do this.

00:05:10.078 --> 00:05:11.254
I'll be back before you know it.

00:05:11.278 --> 00:05:12.946
I could fly up
and meet you halfway.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.783
Oh, only if you learn to glow
like your Auntie Carol.

00:05:48.767 --> 00:05:50.034
Come here, Goosey.

00:05:52.203 --> 00:05:54.146
Incoming call from Nick Fury.

00:05:54.171 --> 00:05:55.844
Oh. You expecting a call?

00:05:56.781 --> 00:05:59.382
Maybe we just send it
to voice mail.

00:06:02.578 --> 00:06:03.687
Nick Fury,

00:06:03.913 --> 00:06:06.468
my favorite one-eyed man
of intrigue.

00:06:06.701 --> 00:06:07.820
Carol Danvers.

00:06:07.845 --> 00:06:09.837
Prodigal child of the Milky Way.

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:11.289
How goes it out there?

00:06:11.445 --> 00:06:12.867
Thriving.

00:06:14.188 --> 00:06:15.789
What the hell was that?

00:06:15.813 --> 00:06:17.203
- Goose?
- Yeah.

00:06:17.398 --> 00:06:18.968
What about you?

00:06:19.023 --> 00:06:20.081
How are you doing?

00:06:20.106 --> 00:06:21.460
What do you know about the surge

00:06:21.485 --> 00:06:24.118
in the jump point system
a few hours ago?

00:06:24.352 --> 00:06:26.812
I didn't notice
anything unusual.

00:06:26.913 --> 00:06:28.179
I'll take a look now.

00:06:28.351 --> 00:06:29.400
It rattled the whole system.

00:06:29.424 --> 00:06:31.209
We're trying to get a handle
on what happened.

00:06:31.233 --> 00:06:32.818
The entire network was affected?

00:06:32.843 --> 00:06:34.515
Yeah. End to end.

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:36.437
Thankfully, our neural network team

00:06:36.462 --> 00:06:40.068
was able to trace the origin
back to MB-418.

00:06:40.327 --> 00:06:41.671
You're in the neighborhood, right?

00:06:41.695 --> 00:06:42.788
Yeah.

00:06:42.937 --> 00:06:44.062
Can you check it out?

00:06:44.788 --> 00:06:46.708
- I'm on it.
- Appreciate you.

00:06:46.936 --> 00:06:49.866
Monica and her team will send
more intel as they acquire it.

00:06:49.897 --> 00:06:52.491
Monica? Wha...
What's she doing there?

00:06:52.516 --> 00:06:53.913
I thought that she was on Earth.

00:06:53.944 --> 00:06:55.646
- Is she okay?
- Yeah.

00:06:56.117 --> 00:06:58.514
And she's not that
little kid you remember.

00:07:13.948 --> 00:07:17.438
So, do we think that
we can finish this before dinner?

00:07:17.472 --> 00:07:19.309
Yeah. I don't think
we're gonna fix it in time

00:07:19.333 --> 00:07:21.531
to get a reading
on the jump point.

00:07:21.609 --> 00:07:25.313
But I do know someone
with superpowers who could.

00:07:25.346 --> 00:07:26.881
Ooh.

00:07:26.914 --> 00:07:29.382
Fine. I'll go.

00:07:29.515 --> 00:07:31.986
You guys head in and check
the status of the network.

00:07:32.019 --> 00:07:34.891
We've gotta find this damage
and see if we can reverse it.

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:36.179
Aye, aye, Captain.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:07.321
Fury,

00:08:07.355 --> 00:08:09.457
I think I found something.

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:11.516
Communications override.

00:08:11.596 --> 00:08:13.628
Captain Rambeau Spacewalk.

00:08:13.661 --> 00:08:14.862
Connected.

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:16.491
Rambeau,

00:08:16.516 --> 00:08:18.063
what the hell are you doin'?

00:08:18.088 --> 00:08:20.602
Seems the surge has had
some residual effect

00:08:20.627 --> 00:08:22.102
on the jump point.

00:08:22.157 --> 00:08:23.860
I'm gonna get you
some readings, Fury.

00:08:23.885 --> 00:08:25.048
Moni...

00:08:25.073 --> 00:08:26.774
- Hello?
- Monica.

00:08:26.799 --> 00:08:27.942
Hello?

00:08:35.082 --> 00:08:36.551
Was that Monica?

00:08:37.085 --> 00:08:38.970
- Aunt Carol?
- Fury, was that Monica?

00:08:38.995 --> 00:08:40.389
Why, you wanna talk to her?

00:08:40.422 --> 00:08:42.350
I, uh... I don't think
I'm in the best...

00:08:43.072 --> 00:08:45.672
position to...
I don't know... I don't want...

00:08:45.837 --> 00:08:47.092
I don't wanna...

00:08:47.516 --> 00:08:48.449
Look...

00:08:48.474 --> 00:08:49.798
I don't wanna
talk to her like this.

00:08:49.822 --> 00:08:51.962
- Not after all this time.
- You know,

00:08:51.987 --> 00:08:53.715
eventually you're gonna
have to talk to her.

00:08:53.763 --> 00:08:55.395
I know.
I know, but...

00:08:55.579 --> 00:08:58.184
let's save the family reunions
till I'm back inside.

00:09:06.414 --> 00:09:08.850
I think I found
the source of the surge.

00:09:09.917 --> 00:09:11.204
What are you seeing?

00:09:12.399 --> 00:09:16.324
It's a jump point,
but it's not closing. Like...

00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.192
it's stuck.

00:09:18.321 --> 00:09:19.407
Danvers.

00:09:33.491 --> 00:09:34.542
Danvers.

00:09:35.631 --> 00:09:36.711
Danvers!

00:09:42.764 --> 00:09:44.886
The jump point's
still leaking energy.

00:09:44.919 --> 00:09:46.554
- Captain Rambeau?
- Hello?

00:09:47.319 --> 00:09:49.624
- Hello?
- Monica.

00:09:57.331 --> 00:09:58.766
Beautiful.

00:10:01.612 --> 00:10:02.545
Ah.

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:04.038
Ooh.

00:10:31.833 --> 00:10:34.836
Oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God!

00:10:39.816 --> 00:10:42.377
Stop spinning, stop spinning,
stop spinning, please!

00:10:48.847 --> 00:10:51.714
It's Nick Fury! Hey!

00:10:51.853 --> 00:10:53.588
How did you... Oh, wow.

00:10:54.026 --> 00:10:55.394
I'm Kamala Khan.

00:10:55.534 --> 00:10:57.525
No, sorry,
I'm Ms. Marvel, actually.

00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:59.111
But I'm from
Jersey City and I...

00:10:59.136 --> 00:11:01.034
Oh, no, I don't have my mask on.

00:11:01.299 --> 00:11:03.682
Is this an Avengers test?

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:06.378
Who the hell are you?

00:11:34.696 --> 00:11:35.797
Um...

00:11:35.894 --> 00:11:36.956
Hi.

00:11:37.482 --> 00:11:39.597
Really good living room.

00:11:40.568 --> 00:11:41.667
Huh?

00:11:41.803 --> 00:11:43.355
- Kamala?
- Kamala?

00:11:51.713 --> 00:11:52.862
What did you do to me?

00:11:52.941 --> 00:11:55.144
- What is Dar-Benn doing?
- It's too late.

00:11:55.198 --> 00:11:57.370
The Supremor's
already on Tarnax.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:00.121
You can't stop this.

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:01.322
Watch me.

00:12:15.493 --> 00:12:17.383
Fury. It's the Kree.

00:12:17.422 --> 00:12:19.311
They're going after
the Skrulls on Tarnax.

00:12:19.336 --> 00:12:22.665
Now, hold on.
Do not go in swinging.

00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:24.890
This is a peace
and reconciliation tour.

00:12:24.915 --> 00:12:27.121
- Fury. I got this.
- Carol...

00:12:29.581 --> 00:12:32.155
So, I switched with
someone named Kamala Khan?

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:34.422
Yeah. She seemed to be
as confused as you are.

00:12:34.589 --> 00:12:36.867
Well, there's nothing in her
power-set about teleportation.

00:12:36.891 --> 00:12:37.899
Enough about her.

00:12:37.924 --> 00:12:40.725
I wanna know what happened
to you on MB-418.

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:41.993
Yes, sir. Uh...

00:12:42.018 --> 00:12:44.811
Let me preface this by saying
I'm not really sure. But...

00:12:44.836 --> 00:12:47.118
I did not break
my closet door, okay?

00:12:47.143 --> 00:12:48.149
I was in space.

00:12:48.174 --> 00:12:50.061
Oh, so it broke itself?

00:12:50.086 --> 00:12:51.709
No, no, no, no, no.
See, I disappeared.

00:12:51.734 --> 00:12:54.123
So maybe
Captain Marvel broke it.

00:12:54.264 --> 00:12:55.717
- What?
- Yes.

00:12:55.877 --> 00:12:57.374
Your friend, Captain Marvel.

00:12:57.399 --> 00:12:59.483
She was walking up and down
our living room,

00:12:59.508 --> 00:13:00.594
and now you come back,

00:13:00.619 --> 00:13:02.265
waltzing in with no apologies.

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:04.485
I'm sorry, Captain Marvel
was in our house?

00:13:04.532 --> 00:13:07.782
Is Captain Marvel
pressuring you in any way?

00:13:07.891 --> 00:13:09.773
Look, I understand that
she's an important figure

00:13:09.797 --> 00:13:12.546
and all that, but you don't
have to do as she says.

00:13:12.571 --> 00:13:15.108
No, no, they're
clearly working together.

00:13:15.133 --> 00:13:16.586
- Look at her face. Look at her smile.
- Aamir, stop it.

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:19.181
- She's being super secretive as always.
- Aamir, stop picking on your sister.

00:13:19.205 --> 00:13:20.423
- Look at her.
- Muneeba.

00:13:20.447 --> 00:13:21.648
Kamala, are you lying again?

00:13:21.672 --> 00:13:23.851
- Just tell me if you're involved in all...
- My daughter has said she's not lying.

00:13:23.875 --> 00:13:24.938
- Kamala.
- Looks like she's having

00:13:24.962 --> 00:13:26.079
- so much fun.
- Muneeba...

00:13:26.104 --> 00:13:28.504
- She's bad at keeping secrets.
- Oh, my God! It's happening!

00:13:36.125 --> 00:13:37.986
Approaching Tarnax.

00:13:42.373 --> 00:13:45.193
Warning. Kree ship detected.

00:14:32.711 --> 00:14:35.010
This is not what
we agreed, Dar-Benn.

00:14:35.044 --> 00:14:36.244
Supremor Dar-Benn.

00:14:36.337 --> 00:14:38.524
The Skrull...
have been scattered

00:14:38.549 --> 00:14:40.610
to every corner of the universe.

00:14:40.875 --> 00:14:44.344
Made refugees wherever we go,
and still,

00:14:44.602 --> 00:14:48.824
we came into these negotiations
in good faith.

00:14:48.858 --> 00:14:50.726
I hear you, Dro'ge.

00:14:52.336 --> 00:14:53.640
I, perhaps more than anyone,

00:14:53.665 --> 00:14:56.391
understand what you and your people
have been through.

00:14:56.836 --> 00:14:59.502
After my predecessor
was destroyed,

00:14:59.844 --> 00:15:02.136
heretics rose up
to fill the void.

00:15:03.915 --> 00:15:05.891
The Civil War
has polluted our skies.

00:15:05.916 --> 00:15:07.610
My people cannot breathe.

00:15:10.157 --> 00:15:11.947
Our sun is dying.

00:15:12.032 --> 00:15:14.349
Hala is out of time.

00:15:15.188 --> 00:15:17.321
I hope we can rebuild together.

00:15:17.407 --> 00:15:19.030
So much so
that I'm willing to put

00:15:19.055 --> 00:15:21.356
our ancient animosities
behind us.

00:15:22.844 --> 00:15:25.226
And give you a chance
to protect your people.

00:15:26.916 --> 00:15:28.383
To stop running.

00:15:32.141 --> 00:15:34.108
The Skrull will take
their rightful place

00:15:34.133 --> 00:15:35.860
in the Kree Empire.

00:15:37.372 --> 00:15:39.344
And I will aid
in their relocation.

00:15:39.493 --> 00:15:41.175
Relocation? What?

00:15:41.336 --> 00:15:43.766
What is the meaning of this?

00:15:45.404 --> 00:15:47.327
I would hate for
your people to suffocate

00:15:47.352 --> 00:15:49.290
when I strip the atmosphere.

00:16:07.883 --> 00:16:09.704
It's the Annihilator!

00:16:20.172 --> 00:16:21.836
There!

00:16:23.836 --> 00:16:25.721
Oh, my God!

00:16:36.274 --> 00:16:37.569
What the hell is going on?

00:16:37.594 --> 00:16:39.054
Yes, what the hell is going on?

00:16:39.079 --> 00:16:41.258
I was on some freaky spaceship
and then I teleported here.

00:16:41.282 --> 00:16:42.383
I don't know
if that's my new power.

00:16:42.407 --> 00:16:44.730
- And then this freaking cat ate a man.
- How can a cat eat a man, Kamala?

00:16:44.754 --> 00:16:45.708
I don't know. It has tentacles

00:16:45.741 --> 00:16:47.084
- and it ate a man.
- What tentacles, Kamala?

00:16:47.108 --> 00:16:48.285
- I don't know.
- Where are the tentacles?

00:16:48.309 --> 00:16:49.320
It comes out of his mouth,
and they're...

00:16:49.344 --> 00:16:50.913
Oh, my God!

00:16:50.946 --> 00:16:51.781
Oh!

00:16:51.814 --> 00:16:54.382
Oh, my God!
It's happening again!

00:16:58.446 --> 00:17:02.243
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- K-Kamala, who are they?

00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:06.160
Please run.

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:12.608
How did you get here,
and how're you involved in this?

00:17:12.633 --> 00:17:15.241
The Kree jury-rigged
a wormhole on MB-418.

00:17:15.266 --> 00:17:16.267
You mean like a jump point?

00:17:16.291 --> 00:17:18.757
I don't know. But,
I touched it and then I...

00:17:18.782 --> 00:17:19.843
Why'd you do that?

00:17:19.868 --> 00:17:21.382
Because it was glowing
and mysterious.

00:17:21.407 --> 00:17:23.468
Okay, new rule,
no more touching shit.

00:17:23.493 --> 00:17:25.085
Especially glowing,
mysterious shit.

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:26.719
Okay, I'm feeling a lot of
negative energy from you

00:17:26.743 --> 00:17:27.969
and I don't like it.
That's not the point.

00:17:27.993 --> 00:17:30.696
The point is, is that it was
siphoning off the atmosphere.

00:17:30.721 --> 00:17:32.493
And it did this!

00:17:32.518 --> 00:17:33.585
Scissors beat paper.

00:17:33.617 --> 00:17:36.155
Fury! There was, like, energy
that went around my hand.

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:37.180
Focus.

00:17:37.343 --> 00:17:38.810
Okay, maybe if I do this.

00:17:45.633 --> 00:17:46.907
Annihilator.

00:17:46.969 --> 00:17:48.210
I don't like that name.

00:18:20.375 --> 00:18:22.540
- Friends of yours?
- Hi.

00:18:48.063 --> 00:18:50.364
Annihilator!

00:18:52.328 --> 00:18:53.328
Hmm.

00:19:10.284 --> 00:19:11.887
Annihilator!

00:19:43.918 --> 00:19:45.551
Aamir, get him!

00:19:45.576 --> 00:19:47.745
Get him! Hit him!

00:20:02.215 --> 00:20:03.652
Yusuf! Oh!

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:15.316
Let me go! Let me go!
Let me go!

00:20:30.527 --> 00:20:32.738
Kamala, are you okay?

00:20:37.543 --> 00:20:38.785
Fury!

00:20:38.988 --> 00:20:40.574
I think I'm getting teleported

00:20:40.599 --> 00:20:42.809
whenever I channel
any kind of radiant ener...

00:20:44.605 --> 00:20:46.645
I think I switch
when I use my powers.

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:47.840
Strong theory.

00:20:55.771 --> 00:20:56.949
Strong theory.

00:20:58.402 --> 00:21:00.973
Our tests keep
generating the same result.

00:21:01.029 --> 00:21:02.660
With each new jump point,

00:21:02.691 --> 00:21:05.012
this band becomes more unstable.

00:21:05.254 --> 00:21:07.936
I strongly suggest we wait
for the second band.

00:21:56.238 --> 00:21:58.508
Oi.

00:22:00.276 --> 00:22:02.117
Hi, again.

00:22:02.574 --> 00:22:04.625
So sorry about earlier.

00:22:04.846 --> 00:22:06.703
We're looking for Kamala Khan.

00:22:06.766 --> 00:22:08.662
Did I get in?

00:22:09.427 --> 00:22:11.232
Is this the new iPad?
I haven't seen it yet.

00:22:11.265 --> 00:22:12.381
They wish!

00:22:12.406 --> 00:22:13.478
- All right. Come on, let's go.
- I know.

00:22:13.502 --> 00:22:15.031
Wait, if this is
all top secret information,

00:22:15.055 --> 00:22:17.338
- why is it on a clear case?
- Uh, well...

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:19.483
Just swipe it a little bit.

00:22:19.508 --> 00:22:21.226
- Whoa, whoa. Hi. Okay.
- Can you believe it?

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:23.079
They have intel on me.

00:22:23.329 --> 00:22:24.513
On me!

00:22:25.188 --> 00:22:26.665
I am intel.

00:22:26.982 --> 00:22:29.140
Look at you!

00:22:29.289 --> 00:22:31.387
Hey, what does, um,
S.A.B.E.R. stand for?

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:33.443
Uh, Strategic Aerospace Biophysics

00:22:33.468 --> 00:22:34.873
and Exolinguistic Response.

00:22:34.898 --> 00:22:36.190
That's classified.

00:22:36.492 --> 00:22:37.493
Sorry.

00:22:38.284 --> 00:22:39.975
"Hard Light powers," yes.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.318
- "Noor..."
- Okay, but why

00:22:41.343 --> 00:22:42.420
do you have intel on her?

00:22:42.445 --> 00:22:44.420
Is there some sort
of surveillance on us?

00:22:44.445 --> 00:22:46.890
- "Surveillance" is a strong word.
- Well, ma'am,

00:22:46.922 --> 00:22:49.985
your daughter is the hero
that saved Jersey City.

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:52.331
So, of course we would
have intel on someone like her.

00:22:52.539 --> 00:22:54.929
And you're also
electromagnetically altered.

00:22:54.953 --> 00:22:55.969
What does that mean?

00:22:55.993 --> 00:22:58.547
Oh, it just means
that we both have

00:22:58.581 --> 00:23:00.657
light-based powers.

00:23:00.821 --> 00:23:02.711
What's your...
What's your code name?

00:23:02.736 --> 00:23:04.537
Oh, I don't have a code name.

00:23:04.562 --> 00:23:06.398
- We'll workshop it.
- No, thank you.

00:23:06.755 --> 00:23:07.990
Aunt Carol... Mmm.

00:23:08.015 --> 00:23:10.733
Captain Marvel
also has light-based powers.

00:23:10.758 --> 00:23:12.271
It's probably not a coincidence.

00:23:12.296 --> 00:23:15.304
Not to mention the two of you
came into direct contact

00:23:15.343 --> 00:23:17.327
with some malfunctioning
jump points.

00:23:17.352 --> 00:23:20.185
I still cannot believe
that Captain Marvel was here

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:21.287
and I didn't even
get to meet her.

00:23:21.311 --> 00:23:23.258
You know, we're supposed to
be all, like, "twinsies!" you know.

00:23:23.282 --> 00:23:25.718
We have the same name.
I would obviously, then...

00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:28.070
I don't know, I would just give her
the letter that I wrote for her

00:23:28.094 --> 00:23:30.546
and we would go out for lunch,
and then it would just...

00:23:30.679 --> 00:23:33.249
D-Did you say "Aunt Carol?"

00:23:33.936 --> 00:23:36.880
I said that Captain Marvel

00:23:36.905 --> 00:23:38.786
can absorb light energy.

00:23:38.811 --> 00:23:40.089
I can see it.

00:23:40.121 --> 00:23:42.404
And you, you can turn light

00:23:42.467 --> 00:23:44.145
into physical matter.

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:45.798
Which I have never heard of.

00:23:45.899 --> 00:23:47.290
- But my working theory...
- I could totally show you.

00:23:47.314 --> 00:23:49.439
Whoa! No!

00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:52.751
What...

00:23:56.005 --> 00:23:57.149
Hi.

00:23:58.064 --> 00:23:59.204
Hi.

00:24:00.149 --> 00:24:02.240
Nah, they don't seem related.

00:24:02.399 --> 00:24:04.210
Whatever, Yusuf.

00:24:04.235 --> 00:24:06.657
- Families are complicated.
- Hmm.

00:24:06.837 --> 00:24:09.845
Uh, Monica,
you wanna fill Carol in

00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:11.687
on your working theory?

00:24:11.782 --> 00:24:13.255
Uh, yeah. Um...

00:24:13.376 --> 00:24:15.548
Hi, Captain Marvel.

00:24:16.603 --> 00:24:19.570
It is so good to see you,
Lieutenant Trouble.

00:24:19.618 --> 00:24:20.763
You too.

00:24:20.796 --> 00:24:22.464
And it's Captain Rambeau now.

00:24:23.774 --> 00:24:25.884
Right. Sorry.

00:24:28.814 --> 00:24:30.171
So, what's new?

00:24:30.196 --> 00:24:31.749
- Where's my sister?
- Yeah.

00:24:31.774 --> 00:24:34.429
I'm thinking that
our joint exposure

00:24:34.454 --> 00:24:36.045
to these unsteady jump points

00:24:36.077 --> 00:24:39.181
and our susceptibility
to electromagnetic energy

00:24:39.206 --> 00:24:41.570
has temporarily entangled
our world-lines.

00:24:41.595 --> 00:24:42.818
Yeah, that, right there.

00:24:43.792 --> 00:24:45.390
- Uh...
- Entanglement.

00:24:45.415 --> 00:24:47.468
Our light powers are entangled.

00:24:47.493 --> 00:24:50.557
So, we switch places whenever
we use them at the same time.

00:24:50.728 --> 00:24:52.994
- Which would mean Kamala...
- When did you get powers?

00:24:53.089 --> 00:24:55.476
I walked through a
radiation shielding barrier

00:24:55.501 --> 00:24:57.812
of a witch hex and now
I can manipulate and see

00:24:57.837 --> 00:24:59.907
all wavelengths of
the electromagnetic spectrum.

00:24:59.932 --> 00:25:01.265
I'm very happy for you.

00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:02.440
Yeah.

00:25:02.464 --> 00:25:03.568
Where's our daughter?

00:25:03.599 --> 00:25:05.270
Yes, please. Where is Kamala?

00:25:05.295 --> 00:25:06.340
Wherever you were.

00:25:06.396 --> 00:25:07.770
- Where were you?
- Who's Kamala?

00:25:07.795 --> 00:25:09.732
The third person
we're switching with.

00:25:09.876 --> 00:25:11.615
Light powers. Teenage girl.

00:25:11.728 --> 00:25:13.466
- Where were you?
- What are you doing?

00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:14.546
What are you doing?

00:25:14.571 --> 00:25:16.582
I'm trying to switch.
Why isn't it working

00:25:16.607 --> 00:25:17.615
- when I need it to work?
- Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

00:25:17.639 --> 00:25:18.630
- Danvers, Danvers!
- Hey!

00:25:18.654 --> 00:25:19.891
- So confused.
- Please tell Kamala

00:25:19.915 --> 00:25:21.223
that her Abu is very upset.

00:25:21.257 --> 00:25:23.118
Hey, where are we going
and why are we going there?

00:25:23.142 --> 00:25:26.376
- Carol!
- Carol, where you going?

00:25:35.204 --> 00:25:37.172
Oh, my God!

00:25:37.349 --> 00:25:38.649
- Uh-oh!
- Monica...

00:25:38.674 --> 00:25:40.042
- Mmm-hmm?
- You gotta fly.

00:25:40.075 --> 00:25:41.287
No, no, no. I...

00:25:41.312 --> 00:25:42.613
I mean, I know.

00:25:42.638 --> 00:25:44.278
But technically,
I haven't done that yet!

00:25:44.303 --> 00:25:45.707
Yeah, well, you got to now

00:25:45.732 --> 00:25:48.154
or Kamala's not gonna
graduate from high school.

00:25:48.232 --> 00:25:49.724
Come on!
Use your core!

00:25:53.355 --> 00:25:54.423
Oh, jeez.

00:25:54.456 --> 00:25:56.325
Hey. Black Girl Magic.

00:26:17.654 --> 00:26:19.607
I got you! I got you!

00:26:19.732 --> 00:26:21.185
I got you!

00:26:21.316 --> 00:26:23.218
Oops!

00:26:41.296 --> 00:26:42.798
Hold on!

00:26:43.839 --> 00:26:45.410
What is happening here?

00:26:45.435 --> 00:26:47.763
I can't hold on
to you while I'm flying.

00:26:49.169 --> 00:26:52.277
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

00:26:52.302 --> 00:26:53.777
- We're gonna die!
- Hold on!

00:26:53.802 --> 00:26:55.645
Hold on! I'm thinking,
I'm thinking!

00:26:55.739 --> 00:26:57.953
Wait, I have an idea.

00:26:58.059 --> 00:26:59.449
Grab on to me!

00:27:01.849 --> 00:27:04.593
This had better work!

00:27:06.168 --> 00:27:08.497
Oh, it's cool. It's Carol.

00:27:13.793 --> 00:27:16.301
Okay, no powers,
no powers. Just...

00:27:28.489 --> 00:27:29.551
Who are they?

00:27:29.684 --> 00:27:33.455
They are associates
of Captain Marvel.

00:27:36.035 --> 00:27:37.559
The Annihilator is here?

00:27:37.626 --> 00:27:38.861
Yeah, well, she was.

00:27:38.886 --> 00:27:41.456
And then these two
just sort of appeared.

00:27:41.481 --> 00:27:42.590
What about the band?

00:27:42.614 --> 00:27:44.324
If she's meddling,
I need to strike now.

00:27:44.356 --> 00:27:46.578
Yeah. I still can't
account for the instabilities

00:27:46.602 --> 00:27:47.942
exhibited on MB-418.

00:27:47.967 --> 00:27:49.935
This thing does
much more than just...

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:51.390
But it works?

00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:54.162
Yes. Yes. But if you
give me more time,

00:27:54.187 --> 00:27:56.129
- I can make it safer...
- No.

00:27:56.176 --> 00:27:58.213
No. We do it now.

00:27:59.037 --> 00:28:01.450
Before the Annihilator appears.

00:28:19.441 --> 00:28:21.510
Uh, what should we do about...

00:28:22.408 --> 00:28:23.608
these two?

00:28:37.241 --> 00:28:38.576
You.

00:28:40.777 --> 00:28:42.217
Hold that thought.

00:29:12.055 --> 00:29:13.298
We gotta get
that band off of her.

00:29:13.322 --> 00:29:14.690
It looks like mine.

00:29:15.222 --> 00:29:16.386
Guys!

00:29:26.268 --> 00:29:28.089
I can't fly.

00:29:29.183 --> 00:29:31.558
Do you guys have a spaceship
I could borrow or...

00:29:31.583 --> 00:29:33.472
Kamala, don't talk to them.

00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:35.253
You know my name!

00:29:44.737 --> 00:29:47.219
The Kree came here hopeful

00:29:47.266 --> 00:29:49.894
that we could build
a covenant of peace.

00:29:49.925 --> 00:29:51.250
What have you done?

00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:54.663
But then you sic
the Annihilator on us.

00:29:56.055 --> 00:29:57.688
Like we're vermin.

00:29:59.289 --> 00:30:03.505
Once again, the Skrull
have betrayed the Kree.

00:30:04.313 --> 00:30:05.708
And for that...

00:30:31.675 --> 00:30:33.435
Carol, we gotta get
these people out of here.

00:30:33.987 --> 00:30:35.304
Emperor Dro'ge,

00:30:35.339 --> 00:30:37.706
you need to evacuate
your people now.

00:30:39.492 --> 00:30:41.128
We have nowhere to go.

00:31:05.052 --> 00:31:06.612
Carol, the ships...

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:11.058
They're not gonna make it.

00:31:12.909 --> 00:31:15.107
Get back to the ship
and don't use your powers.

00:31:15.132 --> 00:31:16.771
- But I can help.
- Now.

00:32:12.409 --> 00:32:14.736
- Let's go.
- Where's Kamala?

00:32:17.166 --> 00:32:18.330
Kamala!

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:31.590
No!

00:32:40.722 --> 00:32:42.731
Let's go, let's go!

00:32:52.852 --> 00:32:54.168
Come on!

00:32:54.485 --> 00:32:56.782
Keep moving, please, please.

00:33:00.276 --> 00:33:01.812
All these people,
they're gonna...

00:33:01.837 --> 00:33:03.343
- Come on, sweetie.
- No! How can you

00:33:03.368 --> 00:33:04.416
- just leave them here?
- Kamala, now!

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:06.388
We need to save who we can.

00:33:46.321 --> 00:33:48.477
Transmission sent.

00:33:54.477 --> 00:33:55.556
Hey.

00:33:55.821 --> 00:33:57.472
This peace treaty,

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.245
it was a good thing.

00:34:00.349 --> 00:34:02.875
- It was a ruse.
- If it were...

00:34:03.345 --> 00:34:05.649
your intervention failed.

00:34:05.931 --> 00:34:09.218
We don't need your help anymore.

00:34:12.001 --> 00:34:14.057
I called a friend.

00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:15.659
She can find
a safe place for you.

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:18.327
Is that okay?

00:34:18.995 --> 00:34:20.664
We have no choice.

00:34:23.728 --> 00:34:25.375
Incoming.

00:34:38.915 --> 00:34:40.449
Are you all right?

00:34:44.563 --> 00:34:46.723
Thank you again.

00:34:47.094 --> 00:34:48.399
Always.

00:34:48.508 --> 00:34:51.016
I see that you've finally
found yourself a team.

00:34:51.079 --> 00:34:52.188
It is unintentional.

00:34:52.213 --> 00:34:54.831
Oh, I've been on some
unintentional teams myself.

00:34:54.883 --> 00:34:57.067
- I know, but...
- You can stand tall...

00:34:57.227 --> 00:34:58.895
without standing alone.

00:35:01.168 --> 00:35:02.660
Take it from me, Marv.

00:35:10.912 --> 00:35:11.913
Hey.

00:35:13.072 --> 00:35:14.874
Captain Marvel will fix this.

00:35:15.283 --> 00:35:16.618
I promise.

00:35:31.362 --> 00:35:32.564
Thank you.

00:35:35.772 --> 00:35:38.174
May our next meeting be joyful.

00:36:20.382 --> 00:36:21.493
Breathe.

00:36:34.007 --> 00:36:35.505
Do you remember?

00:36:36.665 --> 00:36:39.649
When the sun used to
shine on Hala?

00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:43.821
How beautiful our home was?

00:36:46.676 --> 00:36:48.110
Before her?

00:36:54.084 --> 00:36:56.251
Before the Annihilator.

00:36:59.055 --> 00:37:00.524
I was there.

00:37:07.008 --> 00:37:09.118
I heard her lies,

00:37:09.398 --> 00:37:12.016
claiming she was there
to set us free.

00:37:13.157 --> 00:37:16.922
But when she destroyed
the Supreme Intelligence,

00:37:17.107 --> 00:37:19.375
she destroyed the Kree.

00:37:26.125 --> 00:37:30.000
For 30 years, I have been
fighting alongside you.

00:37:30.758 --> 00:37:33.141
Not only have
I brought you peace,

00:37:33.456 --> 00:37:36.805
but I have found a way
to return Hala to glory.

00:37:36.899 --> 00:37:39.422
Supremor!

00:37:39.641 --> 00:37:42.094
Supremor!

00:37:43.485 --> 00:37:45.735
We need more power
than that band can provide

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.399
if we're to reignite our sun.

00:37:48.024 --> 00:37:49.704
That amount of energy...

00:37:49.839 --> 00:37:51.274
Well, it would kill you.

00:37:51.797 --> 00:37:53.436
If my life is the cost,
so be it.

00:37:53.461 --> 00:37:55.436
We will find the other
in time, Suprem...

00:37:55.461 --> 00:37:57.125
There is no more time.

00:37:58.938 --> 00:38:00.850
Hala is out of time.

00:38:23.306 --> 00:38:24.657
Need a hand?

00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:29.391
Yeah.

00:38:41.447 --> 00:38:43.743
Will you hand me that laser?
Three micrometres.

00:38:48.446 --> 00:38:49.547
Wow.

00:38:49.829 --> 00:38:52.461
So you can do that because
you walked through a witch hex?

00:38:52.486 --> 00:38:53.696
Yep.

00:38:53.813 --> 00:38:55.165
When I got blipped back,

00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:57.321
they weren't sending us
to space anymore.

00:38:57.579 --> 00:39:00.868
Grounded us to investigate
earthbound anomalies.

00:39:01.297 --> 00:39:02.640
That must have been hard.

00:39:02.696 --> 00:39:03.938
Your mom told me that you

00:39:03.963 --> 00:39:05.719
always dreamed
of going to space.

00:39:05.899 --> 00:39:07.150
That you had something to prove.

00:39:07.174 --> 00:39:09.336
You said you'd be back
before I knew it.

00:39:10.429 --> 00:39:11.500
What?

00:39:11.915 --> 00:39:13.219
When you left,

00:39:14.196 --> 00:39:17.118
you said you'd be back
before I knew it.

00:39:19.375 --> 00:39:22.047
I meant what I said.
I just, I didn't...

00:39:22.118 --> 00:39:23.446
know what I was...

00:39:23.719 --> 00:39:25.258
getting myself into.

00:39:25.283 --> 00:39:27.904
I-I didn't know how to explain
to a little girl that...

00:39:27.937 --> 00:39:31.941
A little girl that hung
on your every word.

00:39:35.712 --> 00:39:37.447
If you knew...

00:39:38.391 --> 00:39:40.196
I was going to come back.

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:41.860
I just...

00:39:42.493 --> 00:39:44.621
There was people that needed me.

00:39:45.354 --> 00:39:46.993
We needed you, Carol.

00:40:06.381 --> 00:40:08.287
- Hey.
- I hope you don't mind.

00:40:08.312 --> 00:40:09.754
I didn't have any other clothes.

00:40:09.779 --> 00:40:11.154
It's totally fine.

00:40:11.576 --> 00:40:12.949
Looks good on you.

00:40:15.852 --> 00:40:17.006
I, um...

00:40:17.787 --> 00:40:19.121
I'm really sorry

00:40:19.154 --> 00:40:20.457
for the way I spoke to you.

00:40:22.425 --> 00:40:23.475
Thank you.

00:40:25.428 --> 00:40:28.076
I know that this
situation isn't ideal,

00:40:28.201 --> 00:40:31.178
but it is actually nice...

00:40:31.496 --> 00:40:33.639
having people on board again.

00:40:35.805 --> 00:40:37.467
It gets pretty lonely out here.

00:40:37.553 --> 00:40:39.754
Anytime you need company,
I will be there.

00:40:39.779 --> 00:40:41.256
I will drop everything.
I will...

00:40:41.281 --> 00:40:42.887
I will drop high school.

00:40:42.912 --> 00:40:44.240
Don't do that.

00:40:45.147 --> 00:40:46.616
But can we start again?

00:40:48.084 --> 00:40:51.186
Hi, I'm Carol Danvers.

00:40:52.662 --> 00:40:54.067
I am Kamala Khan.

00:40:54.092 --> 00:40:56.085
But when I'm fighting crime
on the streets of Jersey City,

00:40:56.109 --> 00:40:57.983
I go by Ms. Marvel,
and I hope that's okay,

00:40:58.008 --> 00:40:59.365
like, copyright-wise.
Because, honestly,

00:40:59.389 --> 00:41:00.693
I never thought
I'd ever get to meet you.

00:41:00.717 --> 00:41:01.988
But now that it's happening
and we're, like,

00:41:02.012 --> 00:41:03.473
touching each other...
I've realized

00:41:03.498 --> 00:41:04.901
I should have asked permission.

00:41:05.498 --> 00:41:06.569
So...

00:41:07.637 --> 00:41:09.272
Twinsies.

00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:12.042
Okay. All right.

00:41:12.075 --> 00:41:14.010
Here's what we're gonna do.

00:41:14.154 --> 00:41:16.084
- Captain Marvel.
- You need to stop calling me that.

00:41:16.108 --> 00:41:18.054
- I used to change your diapers.
- Oh, that was once.

00:41:18.078 --> 00:41:19.897
And then I was told
you proceeded to vomit everywhere.

00:41:19.921 --> 00:41:22.778
First of all, it's my ship,
so I make the game plan.

00:41:22.803 --> 00:41:24.688
Um, sorry, when's the last time
you led a team?

00:41:24.713 --> 00:41:27.332
- As early as l-last week.
- Goose doesn't count.

00:41:27.357 --> 00:41:28.824
Please. You try giving
Goose orders.

00:41:28.849 --> 00:41:29.981
Oh, my God, we're a team?

00:41:30.006 --> 00:41:31.880
- We're not. We're not a team.
- Oh, no, no, no, we're not a team.

00:41:31.904 --> 00:41:35.715
I, Kamala Khan of Jersey City,

00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:37.192
am on a team with Captain Marvel

00:41:37.217 --> 00:41:38.910
and Captain Monica Rambeau,

00:41:38.935 --> 00:41:41.537
who from this point onwards
will now be known as...

00:41:43.326 --> 00:41:44.803
- Professor Marvel.
- Oh!

00:41:44.908 --> 00:41:46.540
Professor Marvel.

00:41:46.665 --> 00:41:48.947
No. No, no. She...
She will not.

00:41:49.064 --> 00:41:50.706
- But thank you.
- The Marvels.

00:41:50.876 --> 00:41:52.986
Now that we've got that
out of the way, team,

00:41:53.032 --> 00:41:54.547
I've been trying to tell you,
I think I know how she's

00:41:54.571 --> 00:41:56.048
making the weird jump points.

00:41:57.243 --> 00:41:58.396
She has one of these.

00:41:58.912 --> 00:42:00.513
It's my nani's bangle.

00:42:00.763 --> 00:42:03.163
It started glowing
really weird-ly

00:42:03.188 --> 00:42:05.055
when Dar-Benn opened
that first jump point.

00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:08.732
Also, it once traveled me
through space and time,

00:42:08.757 --> 00:42:10.748
so that's probably related.

00:42:11.701 --> 00:42:13.762
What you're describing
is a Quantum Band.

00:42:13.787 --> 00:42:15.132
I mean, I-I knew
there were two of these.

00:42:15.156 --> 00:42:17.541
I just did not expect
the other one to be in space.

00:42:17.982 --> 00:42:20.360
They're a pair? H-How do
you have a Quantum Band?

00:42:20.385 --> 00:42:22.407
Okay. W-What is
a Quantum Band?

00:42:22.508 --> 00:42:24.545
A myth. Or I thought
it was a myth.

00:42:24.570 --> 00:42:26.349
It's an ancient artifact.

00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:30.086
So this is what
Dar-Benn found on MB-418.

00:42:30.111 --> 00:42:31.230
And then her and Kamala just

00:42:31.254 --> 00:42:33.060
happened to stumble
into each other?

00:42:33.123 --> 00:42:34.657
I mean, what are the chances?

00:42:34.691 --> 00:42:36.967
"What you seek is seeking you."

00:42:37.278 --> 00:42:39.122
It's inscribed on the bangle.

00:42:39.165 --> 00:42:41.264
If the Kree legends are true,

00:42:41.297 --> 00:42:43.107
the Quantum Bands
were used to create

00:42:43.132 --> 00:42:45.006
every jump point
in the universe.

00:42:45.031 --> 00:42:46.636
Teleportation network.

00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:48.506
Two Quantum Bands

00:42:48.568 --> 00:42:50.795
working in unison
to connect the galaxy.

00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:52.060
So that would explain

00:42:52.085 --> 00:42:54.277
our switch-y
entanglement situation.

00:42:54.310 --> 00:42:57.115
Yeah, yeah, but
Dar-Benn only has one.

00:42:57.373 --> 00:42:59.829
She must be overloading it
with the energy

00:42:59.854 --> 00:43:01.484
from her space hammer thingy.

00:43:01.518 --> 00:43:02.766
It's called the Universal Weapon.

00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:05.210
Oh, really?
I was gonna call it Cosmi-Rod.

00:43:05.235 --> 00:43:07.499
Either way,
she's using it to force

00:43:07.524 --> 00:43:09.532
unstable jump points
into the grid.

00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:12.571
We have got to get to her
before she makes another one.

00:43:12.796 --> 00:43:15.235
She had star charts and maps
on the screens on her ship.

00:43:15.305 --> 00:43:17.700
Okay. To where?

00:43:18.334 --> 00:43:20.469
- To the stars?
- Okay.

00:43:21.204 --> 00:43:23.072
It's fine. Got a plan.

00:43:23.993 --> 00:43:25.242
We will use this.

00:43:25.276 --> 00:43:27.343
- Is that...?
- A Skrull torture device.

00:43:27.377 --> 00:43:29.407
And, wait, we put it
on our heads?

00:43:29.679 --> 00:43:33.297
Yes, it's fine.
You use it to access memories.

00:43:33.469 --> 00:43:35.086
I've been using it to...

00:43:35.385 --> 00:43:37.735
regain the memories
that the Kree took from me.

00:43:39.047 --> 00:43:40.165
Still?

00:43:40.493 --> 00:43:41.500
Yeah.

00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:43.784
But, you know,
it has a lot of other uses.

00:43:43.847 --> 00:43:45.370
It's safe.

00:43:45.675 --> 00:43:47.250
You might wanna get comfortable.

00:43:53.907 --> 00:43:55.969
Whoa! This is weird.

00:43:57.266 --> 00:43:58.575
Wait. Go back.

00:44:00.367 --> 00:44:03.561
Her band absorbs your energy
and redirects it.

00:44:03.586 --> 00:44:07.046
I-It's like you gave her power
to use against you.

00:44:08.718 --> 00:44:09.812
Kamala?

00:44:10.812 --> 00:44:12.679
Hmm...
What about this?

00:44:12.773 --> 00:44:14.225
There!
Those coordinates.

00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:15.593
- Can you read that?
- Yes.

00:44:15.618 --> 00:44:17.242
The Magellanic Galaxy.

00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:21.701
All right, the pilot seat's all you.

00:44:21.726 --> 00:44:25.140
Is that you, Monica?
You're so cute-ah!

00:44:26.664 --> 00:44:28.882
- No, wait.
- Carol, what are you doing?

00:44:32.342 --> 00:44:33.961
Why'd you ask me to come, Maria?

00:44:34.156 --> 00:44:35.164
Mom.

00:44:36.828 --> 00:44:38.481
The cancer's back.

00:44:39.516 --> 00:44:42.171
So, I need you
to take care of Goose.

00:44:43.523 --> 00:44:45.006
- No.
- What do you mean "no?"

00:44:45.031 --> 00:44:46.921
No, I mean, you beat it once.
You'll beat it again.

00:44:46.945 --> 00:44:47.984
Carol...

00:44:48.099 --> 00:44:50.655
- I'm not taking the cat.
- It's not a cat.

00:44:52.771 --> 00:44:54.599
It should've been you that day.

00:44:55.479 --> 00:44:57.363
That stupid race to the hangar.

00:44:57.534 --> 00:45:00.279
I never wanted to be
Captain Marvel.

00:45:00.607 --> 00:45:03.170
Captain Rambeau suits me
just fine.

00:45:03.473 --> 00:45:06.107
And it's just until
Monica gets back.

00:45:08.623 --> 00:45:09.865
She blipped.

00:45:09.890 --> 00:45:11.710
Carol, I don't
wanna relive this.

00:45:11.803 --> 00:45:12.928
I'm sorry.

00:45:17.217 --> 00:45:19.043
Stop now, please, Carol!

00:45:19.068 --> 00:45:20.834
Remember why you're out there.

00:45:20.859 --> 00:45:22.891
- I'm looking for a patient in room 104.
- I don't know.

00:45:22.915 --> 00:45:24.114
I don't know what to tell you.

00:45:24.138 --> 00:45:25.638
And remember to come home.

00:45:25.732 --> 00:45:27.774
Your mom, she died, honey.

00:45:27.806 --> 00:45:30.240
No. No, no, no!

00:45:34.654 --> 00:45:35.839
Never do that again.

00:45:35.872 --> 00:45:37.756
I'm sorry.
It wasn't on purpose.

00:45:37.781 --> 00:45:38.896
Wait, so your mom...

00:45:38.921 --> 00:45:41.490
Passed away while I was blipped.

00:45:42.388 --> 00:45:43.921
And when I came back,

00:45:43.948 --> 00:45:45.448
no one was there.

00:45:51.529 --> 00:45:53.124
Okay.

00:46:00.115 --> 00:46:02.165
Thank you.

00:46:05.102 --> 00:46:07.504
She seemed really cool.
I'm sorry.

00:46:07.938 --> 00:46:09.099
She was.

00:46:09.521 --> 00:46:10.951
She was the best.

00:46:13.303 --> 00:46:16.413
Well, we have to make do
with what we know right now.

00:46:17.213 --> 00:46:19.209
Here...
is what we do know.

00:46:19.382 --> 00:46:21.623
The Universal Neural
Teleportation Network

00:46:21.648 --> 00:46:22.953
is a system of wormholes

00:46:22.987 --> 00:46:25.443
through the space-time continuum
aka, jump points,

00:46:25.468 --> 00:46:28.125
which allows us to hop between
different planetary systems.

00:46:28.193 --> 00:46:30.493
Basically, it stretches
and reconfigures space

00:46:30.527 --> 00:46:32.193
without rupturing the continuum.

00:46:32.481 --> 00:46:34.974
Like fracking,
the more holes you drill,

00:46:34.999 --> 00:46:37.300
the more destabilized
the shale becomes,

00:46:37.434 --> 00:46:39.037
and then... earthquake.

00:46:41.006 --> 00:46:43.334
Bottom line, if she keeps
creating these jump points,

00:46:43.359 --> 00:46:45.349
it's gonna get really bad,
really fast.

00:46:45.545 --> 00:46:48.521
Question is, what does she want?

00:46:48.826 --> 00:46:51.271
Tarnax used to be
occupied by the Kree,

00:46:51.296 --> 00:46:53.560
so maybe the attack
was a warning?

00:46:53.615 --> 00:46:55.719
So, she could be after
another former colony?

00:46:55.752 --> 00:46:57.632
Is there a former Kree colony
in the Magellanic?

00:46:57.701 --> 00:46:59.246
At one point, the Kree colonized

00:46:59.271 --> 00:47:01.621
25% of the galaxy, so...

00:47:01.646 --> 00:47:03.832
If all she wanted
was to destroy Tarnax,

00:47:03.857 --> 00:47:06.463
why not bring in an army
or use a bomb or something?

00:47:06.498 --> 00:47:07.653
Why... why a jump point?

00:47:07.678 --> 00:47:09.496
You're right.
Jump points aren't weapons,

00:47:09.521 --> 00:47:10.900
they're means of transportation.

00:47:10.935 --> 00:47:12.496
Every jump point has two sides,

00:47:12.521 --> 00:47:15.412
so if Tarnax's atmosphere
was siphoned away,

00:47:15.513 --> 00:47:17.975
- it had to go somewhere, or...
- Hala.

00:47:19.935 --> 00:47:20.977
The Kree Civil War

00:47:21.002 --> 00:47:23.660
basically bankrupted Hala
of its natural resources.

00:47:23.685 --> 00:47:25.067
The air is barely breathable,

00:47:25.092 --> 00:47:27.028
- they're suffering from a drought.
- A drought?

00:47:27.052 --> 00:47:29.395
So, she could be
after water next.

00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:32.092
Okay. Where in the Magellanic
can we find...

00:47:32.117 --> 00:47:33.451
Aladna.

00:47:34.724 --> 00:47:37.411
Oceans cover 99.63%
of the planet.

00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:40.240
That is a very specific stat.
You've been there.

00:47:42.373 --> 00:47:43.497
Well...

00:47:43.528 --> 00:47:45.170
Uh... uh, yeah.

00:47:47.946 --> 00:47:49.429
She said that really weird.

00:47:49.454 --> 00:47:50.804
- Yeah. Why are you being weird?
- Okay.

00:47:50.828 --> 00:47:52.524
Consensus on Aladna.

00:47:54.610 --> 00:47:55.617
Aye.

00:47:55.642 --> 00:47:57.032
Yeah, I say we do it.

00:47:57.485 --> 00:48:00.251
Get to Aladna and separate
Dar-Benn from that bangle.

00:48:00.493 --> 00:48:01.993
We have our heading.

00:48:02.212 --> 00:48:06.632
Kamala, you are not going
on any space adventures.

00:48:06.657 --> 00:48:09.461
Nicholas has told me
how dangerous they can be.

00:48:09.486 --> 00:48:11.883
It's just "Fury." God.

00:48:12.290 --> 00:48:14.016
Wait. Where are you guys?
Where is Abu?

00:48:14.110 --> 00:48:18.173
Hell.
This man has taken us to Hell.

00:48:19.636 --> 00:48:21.872
Hell?
So that means I'm the devil?

00:48:21.906 --> 00:48:24.507
- Really, Fury?
- They insisted,

00:48:24.541 --> 00:48:27.311
and your dad is not adjusting
very well to space travel.

00:48:27.336 --> 00:48:29.814
Hey, babes, so I'm in
this crazy space elevator

00:48:29.847 --> 00:48:31.015
and we're going up.

00:48:31.048 --> 00:48:34.696
Or... maybe we're
going down. Uh...

00:48:34.813 --> 00:48:36.860
- Are there directions in space?
- Yes, there are.

00:48:36.884 --> 00:48:38.344
But no filming.

00:48:38.369 --> 00:48:40.357
Oh. Okay.

00:48:41.025 --> 00:48:42.546
Help me.

00:48:43.259 --> 00:48:44.461
Whoa.

00:48:52.125 --> 00:48:54.040
Fury, everything okay?

00:48:54.088 --> 00:48:55.371
We've had another surge.

00:48:55.405 --> 00:48:57.422
Reports are coming in
across the network.

00:48:57.447 --> 00:48:59.063
It seems everyone's
been affected.

00:48:59.165 --> 00:49:01.477
Well, we need to stop
her from making another one,

00:49:01.502 --> 00:49:03.702
and we can't risk
intergalactic body swapping

00:49:03.727 --> 00:49:04.782
in the meantime.

00:49:04.807 --> 00:49:06.819
Mrs. Khan, I'm sorry,
but your daughter

00:49:06.844 --> 00:49:08.171
will have to stay aboard my ship

00:49:08.196 --> 00:49:09.949
- until we can get to the bottom of this.
- Oh, no, no, no.

00:49:09.973 --> 00:49:10.855
Yes!

00:49:10.988 --> 00:49:12.322
You will let her go.

00:49:12.355 --> 00:49:15.660
Mrs. Khan, uh,
it is not that simple.

00:49:15.793 --> 00:49:17.562
W-We need Kamala.

00:49:18.165 --> 00:49:19.561
Ammi, we found
Nani's other bangle,

00:49:19.586 --> 00:49:21.607
and there's this weirdly beautiful
but kind of terrifying woman

00:49:21.631 --> 00:49:22.719
using the other one
to hurt people.

00:49:22.743 --> 00:49:23.780
And we have to stop her.

00:49:23.805 --> 00:49:25.322
You're telling me
there's another bangle.

00:49:25.346 --> 00:49:27.938
And they're going to use
that bangle to hurt you?

00:49:27.993 --> 00:49:29.210
Monica will take care of her.

00:49:29.235 --> 00:49:30.655
We will.
And we will make sure

00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:32.704
she gets back home in one piece.

00:49:32.790 --> 00:49:33.911
I promise.

00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:35.477
Stay the course.

00:49:35.524 --> 00:49:37.969
We'll figure out how to
close those jump points.

00:49:38.008 --> 00:49:40.450
Kamala, you listen to me.

00:49:40.583 --> 00:49:43.620
If anything happens to you,
I will kill her.

00:49:43.653 --> 00:49:45.122
You tell her that.

00:49:46.609 --> 00:49:48.242
I love you, beta.

00:49:48.468 --> 00:49:49.491
I love you more.

00:49:49.516 --> 00:49:50.876
Wait, what did she just say?

00:49:50.992 --> 00:49:52.079
Nothing.

00:49:52.515 --> 00:49:55.632
Nobody cares more
than Captain Marvel,

00:49:55.657 --> 00:49:57.374
and nobody gets
more grief for it.

00:49:57.399 --> 00:50:00.537
Trust me. Kamala is in
good hands with Carol.

00:50:04.633 --> 00:50:06.524
What's wrong with that cat?

00:50:06.977 --> 00:50:08.511
It's acting very weird.

00:50:08.545 --> 00:50:11.766
Also, Mr. Fury,
she's looking little pudgy.

00:50:11.915 --> 00:50:13.784
I think you're overfeeding her.

00:50:15.407 --> 00:50:16.786
Goose.

00:50:20.858 --> 00:50:21.959
Goose!

00:50:23.794 --> 00:50:25.096
Firefly? Night Light.

00:50:25.128 --> 00:50:26.964
Countess Marvel.
Mistress Marvel?

00:50:26.998 --> 00:50:28.555
- Doctor Marvel?
- That's too much.

00:50:28.579 --> 00:50:29.719
Doctor Bright.

00:50:29.883 --> 00:50:31.860
Mmm... Professor Marvel.

00:50:32.196 --> 00:50:34.140
Nova, Supernova Girl...

00:50:34.165 --> 00:50:35.393
- Spectrum, Spectrum-Vision.
- You're doing too much.

00:50:35.417 --> 00:50:37.340
Vision! Oh, wait. No, sorry.

00:50:37.374 --> 00:50:39.502
How many times do I have to
tell you guys, I do not want

00:50:39.526 --> 00:50:41.619
- or need a code name?
- Why?

00:50:41.644 --> 00:50:44.357
Besides, none of it matters
if we're not coordinated out there.

00:50:44.382 --> 00:50:46.102
Wanna figure out
the switching thing?

00:50:48.003 --> 00:50:50.743
Powers stay activated after a switch.
Good to know.

00:50:50.768 --> 00:50:52.890
Okay, everyone
together on three.

00:50:52.931 --> 00:50:55.558
Ready? One,
two, three, go.

00:50:56.081 --> 00:50:58.121
Now, why would you say "go"
if we're going on three?

00:50:58.145 --> 00:50:59.151
I'm aware.

00:51:05.808 --> 00:51:06.855
Now.

00:51:07.448 --> 00:51:08.495
Now.

00:51:09.050 --> 00:51:10.050
Now.

00:51:10.110 --> 00:51:11.274
One, two, three!

00:51:13.518 --> 00:51:14.894
She gave me eyes.

00:51:18.149 --> 00:51:19.198
Now.

00:51:19.784 --> 00:51:21.573
- Now.
- Can you hold on for one second?

00:51:22.158 --> 00:51:23.861
Walk. And switch!

00:51:23.955 --> 00:51:24.963
Ooh!

00:51:25.948 --> 00:51:27.006
Switch!

00:51:30.761 --> 00:51:31.956
Hey, I got this!

00:51:39.046 --> 00:51:40.062
Yes!

00:51:43.099 --> 00:51:45.388
And switch!

00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:48.112
That's why you wanna
invest in index funds

00:51:48.159 --> 00:51:49.908
rather than
in individual stocks.

00:51:49.933 --> 00:51:52.149
Of course,
both a Roth IRA and 401k

00:51:52.183 --> 00:51:54.175
are important for tax purposes.

00:51:54.222 --> 00:51:56.529
You know, I never even thought
about planning for retirement.

00:51:56.553 --> 00:51:58.170
Hey, it's never too late.

00:51:58.381 --> 00:51:59.431
And it's never too early,

00:51:59.456 --> 00:52:00.847
like I say.

00:52:00.872 --> 00:52:02.558
- How old are you?
- 306.

00:52:02.659 --> 00:52:04.178
- Huh?
- Wow. Same age.

00:52:08.032 --> 00:52:09.513
Ya Allah!
What was that?

00:52:09.646 --> 00:52:10.873
- I'm gonna find out.
- Please.

00:52:10.898 --> 00:52:13.409
Foreign object in sector K.

00:52:13.573 --> 00:52:16.034
- Sweet Svartalfheim.
- Don't touch it.

00:52:18.081 --> 00:52:19.176
What is it?

00:52:19.222 --> 00:52:20.963
I haven't the foggiest idea.

00:52:21.042 --> 00:52:23.221
- How did it get in there?
- I don't know.

00:52:24.915 --> 00:52:26.483
Should we tell Fury?

00:52:28.041 --> 00:52:30.415
Twenty seconds
to the jump point.

00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:32.032
Do you guys realize
how crazy this is right now?

00:52:32.056 --> 00:52:34.252
Like, I'm... I'm in a spaceship
with two superheroes.

00:52:34.277 --> 00:52:35.580
Also, is it too late
to go to the bathroom?

00:52:35.604 --> 00:52:37.314
Because I feel like
it's gonna hit really soon.

00:52:37.338 --> 00:52:38.433
No one would believe me.
Like my...

00:52:38.457 --> 00:52:40.838
Nakia, she would never...
Whoa!

00:53:35.119 --> 00:53:37.415
Okay. Here we go.

00:53:37.571 --> 00:53:39.649
- Comms.
- Wow!

00:53:40.008 --> 00:53:42.015
- I've always wanted one of these.
- Thank you.

00:53:42.441 --> 00:53:43.602

00:53:43.627 --> 00:53:44.838

00:53:44.862 --> 00:53:46.550
Kamala, we hear you, baby.

00:53:46.799 --> 00:53:47.839
Thank you.

00:53:48.867 --> 00:53:51.969
So, uh, real quick
before we get sucked in...

00:53:52.002 --> 00:53:53.470
What the hell is that?

00:53:53.512 --> 00:53:57.056
I should warn you that
I'm kind of famous here.

00:53:57.204 --> 00:53:59.808
Well, you do know
you're famous everywhere, right?

00:53:59.870 --> 00:54:01.167
This one's kinda different.

00:54:01.192 --> 00:54:03.607
I helped the prince
with a legal issue.

00:54:03.667 --> 00:54:04.724

It already has.

01:07:19.595 --> 01:07:20.556

01:07:43.835 --> 01:07:45.837
We left Aladna
to fend for themselves.

01:07:45.871 --> 01:07:47.383
Dar-Benn was
gonna get my bangle.

01:07:47.407 --> 01:07:49.498
So I made a tough call
like you did on Tarnax.

01:07:49.523 --> 01:07:51.015
Don't try to be like me.

01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:52.632
I messed this whole thing up.

01:07:52.796 --> 01:07:54.138
If we weren't entangled,

01:07:54.163 --> 01:07:55.928
if we weren't here, then you
could have beat Dar-Benn.

01:07:55.952 --> 01:07:57.448
And I'm sorry.

01:07:59.452 --> 01:08:01.822
No, you don't understand.

01:08:01.991 --> 01:08:05.390
The Kree had been ruled
by an AI for a millennia

01:08:05.462 --> 01:08:07.046
that led them into a war.

01:08:07.071 --> 01:08:10.528
And I thought the only way
to stop it was to destroy it.

01:08:11.382 --> 01:08:12.596
But I just...

01:08:13.297 --> 01:08:14.766
made it worse.

01:08:16.148 --> 01:08:18.631
I'm the reason why
the civil war started in the first place.

01:08:18.655 --> 01:08:21.788
I'm the reason why
they couldn't breathe the air.

01:08:22.358 --> 01:08:24.475
That's how I got
the name Annihilator.

01:08:26.124 --> 01:08:29.047
And I never wanted you
to see that version of me.

01:08:31.905 --> 01:08:34.538
Is that why you never came back?

01:08:34.921 --> 01:08:36.827
I thought if I fixed it,

01:08:37.085 --> 01:08:38.733
then I could come home.

01:08:39.624 --> 01:08:40.826
Carol.

01:08:41.927 --> 01:08:45.046
That's not how family works.

01:08:46.108 --> 01:08:50.296
I never expected you to be
the mighty Captain Marvel.

01:08:51.835 --> 01:08:53.671
I just wanted you.

01:08:55.183 --> 01:08:56.775
My aunt.

01:09:02.314 --> 01:09:04.206
I'm really glad that
you're here now.

01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:12.791
And you, too.

01:09:13.573 --> 01:09:15.214
I'm glad to be here.

01:09:16.159 --> 01:09:17.434
I hope that goes without saying.

01:09:17.458 --> 01:09:19.855
And I am sorry...

01:09:19.964 --> 01:09:22.067
for coming on too strong
at the beginning.

01:09:22.253 --> 01:09:24.597
I did not give you a lot of space
to be a real person.

01:09:29.167 --> 01:09:30.589
We have to find her.

01:09:30.714 --> 01:09:32.300
I mean, but she
could be anywhere.

01:09:32.325 --> 01:09:33.378
No...

01:09:33.769 --> 01:09:35.191
not anywhere.

01:09:36.057 --> 01:09:37.956
She's targeting the people
that I care about

01:09:37.983 --> 01:09:40.952
and stealing resources
from every place I call home.

01:09:41.585 --> 01:09:43.144
We have to warn Fury.

01:09:49.762 --> 01:09:51.441
This is an emergency.

01:09:51.466 --> 01:09:53.378
All S.A.B.E.R. personnel
must report

01:09:53.403 --> 01:09:55.737
to an evacuation pod
immediately.

01:09:55.895 --> 01:09:57.073
Walk. Do not run.

01:09:57.098 --> 01:09:58.706
We only have one
evacuation bay online.

01:09:58.737 --> 01:10:00.017
Which means that
all we have left

01:10:00.046 --> 01:10:02.472
to evacuate 350 personnel
are 15 escape pods

01:10:02.497 --> 01:10:03.933
which seat five, 10,
if we squeeze.

01:10:03.958 --> 01:10:05.832
- It's nowhere near enough.
- Well, fill the remaining ones

01:10:05.856 --> 01:10:07.441
with as many people as you can,

01:10:07.466 --> 01:10:08.925
then come up with a Plan B.

01:10:08.950 --> 01:10:11.216
This is an emergency.
All S.A.B.E.R...

01:10:19.706 --> 01:10:22.362
No. No, no, no.

01:10:22.464 --> 01:10:25.034
- Aamir. Go help them.
- Okay, okay. Okay.

01:10:27.542 --> 01:10:29.636
I got this.

01:10:32.771 --> 01:10:35.206
My living room.

01:10:35.231 --> 01:10:37.108
Goose?

01:10:48.417 --> 01:10:51.338
Goose, how'd you...

01:10:51.622 --> 01:10:54.463
Come here. Come. Come on.

01:10:54.488 --> 01:10:57.463
Yes. Yes. Come here.
Look at you.

01:10:57.870 --> 01:11:00.260
Oh. Look!

01:11:00.542 --> 01:11:01.799
Oh, no, not my good eye!

01:11:01.824 --> 01:11:03.151
Whoa!

01:11:03.651 --> 01:11:05.737
We only have
one escape pod left.

01:11:05.971 --> 01:11:07.205
We're doomed.

01:11:08.581 --> 01:11:10.042
In the end...

01:11:10.378 --> 01:11:13.152
none of us choose
how we transition from this life

01:11:13.292 --> 01:11:14.510
to the next.

01:11:14.699 --> 01:11:16.579
What? No!

01:11:16.604 --> 01:11:18.612
Get everyone to the evacuation deck.

01:11:18.729 --> 01:11:19.792
Now!

01:11:26.321 --> 01:11:28.290
Here, kitty.
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

01:11:28.315 --> 01:11:30.829
What are we doing?

01:11:30.854 --> 01:11:32.118
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

01:11:32.143 --> 01:11:34.099
Let's go.
Come on. Come on.

01:11:34.132 --> 01:11:36.665
- I can't. Can you?
- I got it.

01:11:39.234 --> 01:11:41.234
What is going on, fam?

01:11:41.399 --> 01:11:42.758
Kamala?

01:11:42.915 --> 01:11:44.399
Kamala! Yusuf, Kamala!

01:11:44.424 --> 01:11:47.782
- Ya Allah.
- Kamala! Kamala!

01:11:49.243 --> 01:11:50.625
You're back safely, beta.

01:11:50.650 --> 01:11:51.836
You're not dead.

01:11:52.047 --> 01:11:53.960
I've lost contact with Earth.

01:11:53.985 --> 01:11:56.360
We're officially at
abandon-ship phase.

01:12:00.586 --> 01:12:01.844
Spit him out.

01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:03.358
- Spit him out.
- No, no, no.

01:12:03.383 --> 01:12:05.235
No. That's the plan.

01:12:06.172 --> 01:12:07.385
- That's the plan?
- It's much easier

01:12:07.409 --> 01:12:09.151
to transport a family of cats

01:12:09.214 --> 01:12:11.175
than hundreds of crew members.

01:12:11.570 --> 01:12:13.347
So, we're literally
herding cats?

01:12:17.636 --> 01:12:18.941
Come here, kitty.

01:12:19.956 --> 01:12:21.691
Attention,
S.A.B.E.R. crew.

01:12:21.925 --> 01:12:24.737
Stop running and let
the Flerkens eat you.

01:12:24.801 --> 01:12:27.486
You will be fine.

01:12:37.796 --> 01:12:38.861
S.A.B.E.R. crew.

01:12:38.886 --> 01:12:41.867
Stop running and let
the Flerkens eat you.

01:12:41.892 --> 01:12:44.327
Stop running.

01:12:58.792 --> 01:13:00.351
I'm sorry.

01:13:05.261 --> 01:13:08.093
Stop running
and let the Flerkens eat you.

01:13:08.126 --> 01:13:10.917
Stop running.

01:13:30.980 --> 01:13:32.884
Guys, I found her.

01:13:33.956 --> 01:13:36.034
- Come on. Come on, move.
- Hey! Come on.

01:13:36.128 --> 01:13:37.644
Come on, come here.

01:13:37.885 --> 01:13:38.931
Whoa!

01:13:38.957 --> 01:13:40.948
- Go, go, go.
- Come on, come on.

01:13:41.153 --> 01:13:43.636
- Go to the spacecraft bay.
- Okay. Come on. Chalo, Chalo.

01:13:43.661 --> 01:13:45.840
Come on.
Yusuf, stop with your belt.

01:13:59.778 --> 01:14:02.814
Nope. No. No, no, no.
Thank you. No.

01:14:03.505 --> 01:14:04.873
Come, come, come.

01:14:11.792 --> 01:14:13.792
Don't you worry, little one.

01:14:13.825 --> 01:14:16.561
Here, go to Kamala.
Go to Kamala.

01:14:19.284 --> 01:14:20.698
There you go, come, come.

01:14:20.745 --> 01:14:22.721
- I found Dar-Benn.
- What?

01:14:23.511 --> 01:14:25.036
She wants our sun.

01:14:52.701 --> 01:14:53.936
You leavin' again?

01:14:54.251 --> 01:14:55.274
Yeah.

01:14:55.774 --> 01:14:57.636
Ammi, the universe isn't safe.

01:14:57.669 --> 01:14:59.838
And if the universe isn't safe,
that means you guys aren't safe.

01:14:59.862 --> 01:15:01.547
And if you guys aren't...

01:15:01.571 --> 01:15:03.040
Listen to me.

01:15:03.609 --> 01:15:07.398
You are chosen
for a greater purpose, okay?

01:15:07.446 --> 01:15:09.714
So, of course you must go now.

01:15:10.626 --> 01:15:13.485
But I will never let you go.

01:15:13.829 --> 01:15:15.954
You understand that, right?

01:15:20.251 --> 01:15:22.141
- Yeah.
- Come back safely, beta.

01:15:22.181 --> 01:15:25.126
You better. I don't wanna
be an only child.

01:15:25.213 --> 01:15:27.673
Not again.
Not with these two.

01:15:30.766 --> 01:15:33.727
You think it's wise taking
that bangle to the bad guy?

01:15:33.774 --> 01:15:35.415
Yes. Mr. Fury's right.
Give it to me.

01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:36.829
I will take it home.

01:15:37.188 --> 01:15:38.541
Dar-Benn's opened
another jump point,

01:15:38.565 --> 01:15:40.407
and we're gonna need
both bangles to close it.

01:15:40.879 --> 01:15:42.103
Then I guess you'd better
make damn sure

01:15:42.127 --> 01:15:43.829
she doesn't get her hands on it.

01:15:44.759 --> 01:15:45.915
Understood.

01:16:02.618 --> 01:16:04.098
Son of a...!

01:16:04.298 --> 01:16:05.602
Oh, God, Mr. Fury,

01:16:05.627 --> 01:16:07.227
you are going
in the wrong direction!

01:16:07.252 --> 01:16:09.111
Mrs. Khan, I know!

01:16:12.102 --> 01:16:14.915
- You did it, Mr. Fury!
- I didn't do anything.

01:16:18.807 --> 01:16:20.001
Are you praying?

01:16:20.657 --> 01:16:22.774
Don't stop! We need
all the help we can get!

01:16:22.799 --> 01:16:25.837
Amen!

01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:27.391
Amen!

01:16:27.416 --> 01:16:28.884
Holy cow!

01:16:28.909 --> 01:16:31.321
- Mr. Fury!
- Whoa!

01:17:23.729 --> 01:17:25.003
There she is,

01:17:25.913 --> 01:17:27.715
the Annihilator herself.

01:17:27.786 --> 01:17:29.456
It's over, Dar-Benn.

01:17:29.655 --> 01:17:30.689
No, not yet.

01:17:30.922 --> 01:17:33.675
I know that you would do
anything to protect Hala.

01:17:34.293 --> 01:17:35.644
This will be the end
of the Kree.

01:17:35.669 --> 01:17:37.519
It will be the end
of everything.

01:17:37.753 --> 01:17:40.948
You took from me.
I'm simply repaying the favor.

01:17:41.837 --> 01:17:42.862
Now...

01:17:42.924 --> 01:17:44.706
give me the band.

01:17:46.045 --> 01:17:47.323
You're forgetting something.

01:17:47.371 --> 01:17:49.269
- What?
- Me.

01:18:03.547 --> 01:18:06.998
This could have been
so much easier.

01:18:07.166 --> 01:18:09.836
I don't know.
I like our odds.

01:19:30.503 --> 01:19:32.569
You're living up
to your name again.

01:19:33.923 --> 01:19:35.290
I didn't want this.

01:19:35.417 --> 01:19:37.319
Death seems to follow you.

01:19:44.378 --> 01:19:46.115
It doesn't have to end
like this, Dar-Benn.

01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:47.428
Please, just give us the bangle.

01:19:47.453 --> 01:19:48.568
I won't!

01:19:50.289 --> 01:19:52.740
Hala's sun died because of you.

01:19:53.048 --> 01:19:54.715
Why shouldn't you repay us?

01:19:56.726 --> 01:19:57.873
Maybe she should.

01:19:59.596 --> 01:20:02.099
The reaction in your sun's core
has slowed.

01:20:02.478 --> 01:20:04.638
It needs an incredible amount
of energy to jump-start it,

01:20:04.662 --> 01:20:06.795
and that's what you have, Carol.

01:20:07.491 --> 01:20:10.628
You can use your powers
to save Hala.

01:20:11.944 --> 01:20:13.748
But I've never done
anything like that before.

01:20:13.773 --> 01:20:15.804
In the last couple of days,
I have done a lot of things

01:20:15.828 --> 01:20:17.428
I have never done before.

01:20:18.703 --> 01:20:20.071
You got this.

01:20:25.716 --> 01:20:26.951
For Hala.

01:20:31.633 --> 01:20:33.013
For Hala.

01:20:50.006 --> 01:20:51.240
Try anything

01:20:51.265 --> 01:20:53.271
and I'll kill her faster
than you can move.

01:20:56.316 --> 01:20:58.719
Carol!

01:21:02.889 --> 01:21:04.092
No!

01:21:19.085 --> 01:21:20.483
You won't survive this.

01:21:20.507 --> 01:21:21.631
Dar-Benn...

01:21:21.948 --> 01:21:23.295
listen to me.

01:22:07.051 --> 01:22:08.371
Are you okay?

01:22:09.468 --> 01:22:10.469
Yeah.

01:22:12.102 --> 01:22:13.589
I didn't switch.

01:22:14.087 --> 01:22:15.347
One, two, three.

01:22:40.862 --> 01:22:43.208
I'm so glad you're okay.

01:22:43.649 --> 01:22:45.159
You got the bangles.

01:22:47.041 --> 01:22:49.309
We're gonna need those.

01:22:50.219 --> 01:22:51.385
Ooh...

01:22:51.427 --> 01:22:53.956
Okay, come on, Princess.

01:22:59.104 --> 01:23:00.873
So, what are we looking at?

01:23:01.065 --> 01:23:03.956
A self-propagating singularity
with negative mass

01:23:03.981 --> 01:23:06.003
and non-Newtonian topology.

01:23:07.433 --> 01:23:10.948
She tore a hole in space-time.

01:23:13.089 --> 01:23:16.843
That is a different reality
bleeding into ours.

01:23:17.124 --> 01:23:18.320
Can we even fix that?

01:23:18.345 --> 01:23:19.951
In theory, you and Carol

01:23:19.976 --> 01:23:21.436
can reproduce
the same amount of energy

01:23:21.460 --> 01:23:22.849
that was used to open it.

01:23:22.874 --> 01:23:24.741
I will absorb it
and then release it,

01:23:24.766 --> 01:23:26.335
but from inside the tear.

01:23:26.382 --> 01:23:28.023
But what about the switching?

01:23:28.103 --> 01:23:30.706
Our, um, powers
aren't entangled anymore.

01:23:31.568 --> 01:23:32.569
Oh.

01:23:34.068 --> 01:23:36.294
Well, that's a...
good thing, I guess.

01:23:36.917 --> 01:23:39.286
But, wait. You want
us to blast you

01:23:39.311 --> 01:23:40.935
with the same amount of power

01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:43.902
that punched a hole
in the fabric of space-time?

01:23:44.464 --> 01:23:47.177
If we wanna un-punch it, yeah.

01:23:48.233 --> 01:23:49.433
Monica...

01:23:50.814 --> 01:23:51.981
You're gonna need this.

01:24:00.362 --> 01:24:01.765
How are you feeling,
Ms. Marvel?

01:24:03.060 --> 01:24:05.614
These bangles traveled
through space and time...

01:24:05.802 --> 01:24:07.208
to find me.

01:24:09.162 --> 01:24:10.680
I was born for this.

01:24:14.755 --> 01:24:16.256
It has to be now.

01:24:20.036 --> 01:24:21.981
Bismillaah.

01:24:58.761 --> 01:25:00.395
Your mom would be proud.

01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:02.942
Higher, further, faster.

01:25:05.144 --> 01:25:07.198
Higher, further, faster.

01:26:04.534 --> 01:26:06.574
It's closing, Monica.
You've gotta get out of there.

01:26:06.745 --> 01:26:09.574
I can't leave, Carol.

01:26:09.636 --> 01:26:10.956
What?
What do you mean?

01:26:10.981 --> 01:26:12.183
I can't leave.

01:26:12.208 --> 01:26:13.589
I have to finish the job.

01:26:13.614 --> 01:26:15.848
No! Monica, it's closing.
You'll be trapped!

01:26:16.349 --> 01:26:17.409
It's okay.

01:26:35.101 --> 01:26:36.501
Come on.

01:26:39.773 --> 01:26:41.908
Always knew
I would have to stay.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.156
- Kam...
- Kamala. Beta.

01:27:57.355 --> 01:27:59.390
Kamala, you saved the world.

01:28:04.394 --> 01:28:06.150
- Why are you crying?
- Beta?

01:28:06.175 --> 01:28:07.691
Why are you crying?

01:28:12.053 --> 01:28:13.387
What happened?

01:28:14.445 --> 01:28:16.079
We lost Monica.

01:28:19.255 --> 01:28:21.417
She got stuck on the other side.

01:28:22.311 --> 01:28:23.647
And Carol?

01:28:27.117 --> 01:28:29.186
She went to fulfill a promise.

01:29:53.361 --> 01:29:54.550
How are things?

01:29:54.683 --> 01:29:57.487
The planets are expected
to make a full recovery.

01:29:57.915 --> 01:29:59.752
And a team of scientists
are being sent to Hala

01:29:59.776 --> 01:30:00.972
to try and help their people.

01:30:01.019 --> 01:30:02.534
That's not what I meant.

01:30:25.823 --> 01:30:26.776
This says "Kitchen,"

01:30:26.801 --> 01:30:29.112
but there are all these
hot sauce packets...

01:30:29.137 --> 01:30:32.480
And then there's this
very bizarre-looking tray,

01:30:32.505 --> 01:30:35.519
which I will say
is a very good quality, though.

01:30:35.552 --> 01:30:37.551
- Oof. You can keep it.
- Oh, no, no, Carol,

01:30:37.576 --> 01:30:38.725
- I just... I don't know...
- Where else would they go?

01:30:38.749 --> 01:30:40.333
Oh, yeah, yeah, it was for me.

01:30:40.614 --> 01:30:42.755
The vastness of it
just gives you

01:30:42.780 --> 01:30:44.982
a whole new perspective on life.

01:30:45.216 --> 01:30:46.732
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

01:30:47.005 --> 01:30:48.754
And it was surprisingly cool.

01:30:51.766 --> 01:30:54.258
This place is amazing.

01:30:54.305 --> 01:30:55.969
Yeah, it is.

01:30:57.533 --> 01:30:59.219
Hey, do you still
fly that thing?

01:30:59.577 --> 01:31:00.977
- You wanna check it out?
- I do.

01:31:01.002 --> 01:31:01.899
All right.

01:31:01.924 --> 01:31:03.329
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

01:31:03.354 --> 01:31:05.063
Come here. Come here.
Come here. Come here.

01:31:05.383 --> 01:31:08.835
Oh, I'm so happy that
you're home safe, beta.

01:31:08.860 --> 01:31:09.976
Okay.

01:31:15.427 --> 01:31:16.428
Aamir...

01:31:17.441 --> 01:31:18.541
this would be a lovely house

01:31:18.565 --> 01:31:20.594
to raise a family in, you know?

01:31:21.086 --> 01:31:23.008
Aamir.

01:31:23.081 --> 01:31:25.274
This is so cool.

01:31:25.396 --> 01:31:26.891
Pilot seat's all you.

01:31:36.281 --> 01:31:37.743
Let's fly this thing.

01:31:38.116 --> 01:31:40.032
I actually don't have the key.

01:31:40.434 --> 01:31:42.282
I'm just looking after it.

01:31:44.057 --> 01:31:45.725
Just until Monica gets back?

01:31:46.669 --> 01:31:47.803
Yeah.

01:31:49.154 --> 01:31:51.618
Just until Monica gets back.

01:31:51.979 --> 01:31:53.563
I really miss her.

01:31:53.898 --> 01:31:56.024
We were good together.

01:31:56.101 --> 01:31:58.297
Which got me thinking...

01:32:10.182 --> 01:32:13.218
Pizza delivery.

01:32:14.063 --> 01:32:15.097
Whew!

01:32:16.531 --> 01:32:17.632
Okay.

01:32:23.892 --> 01:32:25.243
Can I help you?

01:32:25.325 --> 01:32:26.826
Kate Bishop.

01:32:30.228 --> 01:32:32.547
Did you think you're the only
kid superhero in the world?

01:32:34.140 --> 01:32:36.024
- Well, I'm 23.
- Oh, I know.

01:32:36.708 --> 01:32:37.976
I've been reading up on you.

01:32:39.145 --> 01:32:40.179
Where did you get that?

01:32:40.206 --> 01:32:41.602
I found it in my couch.

01:32:41.973 --> 01:32:42.922
Okay.

01:32:42.954 --> 01:32:45.390
You've just become part
of a much larger universe.

01:32:46.495 --> 01:32:50.299
Which, at the moment,
is just me, mostly.

01:32:50.379 --> 01:32:51.509
I do have feelers out, though.

01:32:51.533 --> 01:32:52.601
Did you know Ant-Man
had a daughter?

01:32:52.625 --> 01:32:53.625
What do you want?

01:32:53.681 --> 01:32:55.274
I'm putting together a team.

01:32:55.758 --> 01:32:57.125
And I want you on it.

01:32:57.551 --> 01:32:59.750
- ♫
- Hmm.

01:33:03.354 --> 01:33:04.757
Please?

01:36:10.929 --> 01:36:12.262
Mom?

01:36:15.272 --> 01:36:16.741
Mom?

01:36:18.455 --> 01:36:20.357
- Mom!
- "Mom"?

01:36:20.392 --> 01:36:22.427
I've missed you so much!

01:36:22.788 --> 01:36:25.027
- You missed me?
- I'm so sorry.

01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:26.925
- I'm... I'm...
- Okay. Okay. Okay, okay.

01:36:26.967 --> 01:36:28.285
Hey, hey, look at me.

01:36:28.317 --> 01:36:29.550
It's okay. You're okay.

01:36:30.793 --> 01:36:32.480
How's our mysterious visitor?

01:36:32.769 --> 01:36:35.168
She seems a little disoriented.

01:36:35.340 --> 01:36:38.472
Where... Where are we?
What happened?

01:36:38.565 --> 01:36:40.534
We were hoping
you could tell us.

01:36:41.291 --> 01:36:43.526
All we know is that
Binary found you.

01:36:43.809 --> 01:36:48.183
My theory? You somehow
crossed through a tear in space-time.

01:36:48.401 --> 01:36:51.479
You are now in a reality
parallel to your own.

01:36:51.857 --> 01:36:54.534
Which is, of course, impossible.

01:36:57.298 --> 01:36:59.717
I think there might be
a little confusion happening.

01:36:59.742 --> 01:37:01.759
Confusion is but the first step

01:37:01.784 --> 01:37:03.196
on the journey to knowledge.

01:37:03.284 --> 01:37:05.753
Okay.
I'll take it from here.

01:37:05.778 --> 01:37:08.042
Charles asked for an update.

01:37:09.396 --> 01:37:11.245
I'll come by
and check on you later.

01:37:22.513 --> 01:37:23.748
Who are you?

01:37:25.269 --> 01:37:27.235
Oh, shit.
