WEBVTT

02:19.583 --> 02:21.458
There's only one here.

02:21.833 --> 02:23.333
They were forged as a pair.

02:23.500 --> 02:26.208
We'll keep looking for it.
It must be buried elsewhere.

02:26.375 --> 02:27.542
Elsewhere?

02:29.750 --> 02:30.792
Like where?

02:45.417 --> 02:48.417
Kamala! Are you doing
your homework, beta?

02:48.875 --> 02:50.708
Yeah! Science!

03:00.208 --> 03:01.208
Boom!

03:01.583 --> 03:03.250
Enter, Kamala Khan.

03:03.583 --> 03:04.583
Ready for...

03:06.250 --> 03:07.500
Captain Marvel.

03:08.708 --> 03:09.792
She needs my help.

03:10.583 --> 03:12.375
Shine on, baby.

03:16.583 --> 03:18.083
Why are hands so hard to draw?

03:18.667 --> 03:21.667
Okay, Ms. Marvel arrives,
and just in time...

03:21.958 --> 03:23.542
...'cause even the Avengers need backup,
ya know?

03:23.708 --> 03:25.167
Wham! Kapow!

03:27.833 --> 03:30.083
This is my chance!

03:33.083 --> 03:34.000
Pow!

03:35.750 --> 03:36.708
Boom!

03:38.417 --> 03:39.333
Not bad, kid.

03:41.458 --> 03:42.500
What's your name?

03:42.667 --> 03:43.625
Ms. Marvel.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Dude.

03:45.250 --> 03:46.167
Twinsies!

03:47.833 --> 03:49.625
Hey, you wanna go party with the Avengers?

03:49.792 --> 03:51.417
Uh... Yeah!

03:52.708 --> 03:53.792
Can you fly?

03:53.958 --> 03:56.917
No, but I can do this!

03:58.083 --> 04:00.500
Kamala! Don't make me come up there!

04:02.750 --> 04:05.583
-That does not sound like science to me.
-Okay.

04:29.208 --> 04:31.500
You don't remember anything?

04:31.958 --> 04:33.500
I see...

04:34.000 --> 04:35.083
flashes.

04:37.333 --> 04:38.375
Little moments.

04:38.917 --> 04:41.583
If I could just piece together
what happened that morning...

04:42.125 --> 04:43.833
maybe it'll all make sense.

04:53.333 --> 04:56.542
You stole me from my home,
my family, my friends.

04:56.750 --> 04:57.917
Lieutenant Trouble.

04:58.583 --> 05:00.542
-Higher, further, faster, baby.
-That's right.

05:01.583 --> 05:04.000
Tell the Supreme Intelligence
that I'm coming to end it.

05:04.792 --> 05:06.667
The war, the lies.

05:07.542 --> 05:08.417
All of it.

05:08.833 --> 05:09.667
You can't do this.

05:10.208 --> 05:11.375
I'll be back before you know it.

05:11.542 --> 05:13.167
I could fly up and meet you halfway.

05:13.333 --> 05:15.792
Only if you learn to glow
like your Auntie Carol.

05:48.625 --> 05:49.958
Come here, Goosey.

05:52.250 --> 05:54.750
Incoming call from Nick Fury.

05:54.917 --> 05:56.125
You expecting a call?

05:56.833 --> 05:58.625
Maybe we just send it to voice mail.

06:02.667 --> 06:03.917
Nick Fury...

06:04.083 --> 06:06.583
my favorite one-eyed man of intrigue.

06:06.750 --> 06:07.792
Carol Danvers.

06:07.958 --> 06:09.833
Prodigal child of the Milky Way.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.167
How goes it out there?

06:11.333 --> 06:12.583
Thriving.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.208
What the hell was that?

06:16.000 --> 06:17.083
-Goose?
-Yeah.

06:18.042 --> 06:18.875
What about you?

06:19.042 --> 06:20.083
How are you doing?

06:20.250 --> 06:23.667
What do you know about the surge
in the jump point system a few hours ago?

06:24.375 --> 06:26.583
I didn't notice anything unusual.

06:26.875 --> 06:28.125
I'll take a look now.

06:28.292 --> 06:29.417
It rattled the whole system.

06:29.583 --> 06:31.083
We're trying to get a handle on
what happened.

06:31.250 --> 06:32.625
The entire network was affected?

06:32.792 --> 06:34.875
Yeah. End to end.

06:35.042 --> 06:36.458
Thankfully, our neural network team...

06:36.625 --> 06:39.750
was able to trace the origin back to
MB-418.

06:40.375 --> 06:42.292
-You're in the neighborhood, right?
-Yeah.

06:42.917 --> 06:43.958
Can you check it out?

06:44.875 --> 06:46.750
-I'm on it.
-Appreciate you.

06:46.917 --> 06:49.792
Monica and her team
will send more intel as they acquire it.

06:49.958 --> 06:51.542
Monica?

06:51.708 --> 06:53.667
What's she doing there?
I thought that she was on Earth.

06:53.833 --> 06:56.042
-Is she okay?
-Yeah.

06:56.208 --> 06:58.500
And she's not that
little kid you remember.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.458
So, do we think that
we can finish this before dinner?

07:17.625 --> 07:18.958
Yeah. I don't think we're gonna fix it

07:19.083 --> 07:21.625
in time to get a reading
on the jump point.

07:21.792 --> 07:25.208
But I do know someone with superpowers
who could.

07:25.375 --> 07:26.792
Oh.

07:27.583 --> 07:29.375
Fine. I'll go.

07:29.542 --> 07:31.417
You guys head in
and check the status of the network.

07:32.167 --> 07:34.542
We've gotta find this damage
and see if we can reverse it.

07:35.083 --> 07:35.917
Aye, aye, Captain.

08:06.292 --> 08:07.167
Fury...

08:07.333 --> 08:08.958
I think I found something.

08:09.500 --> 08:11.292
Communications override.

08:11.792 --> 08:13.250
Captain Rambeau. Spacewalk.

08:13.708 --> 08:14.625
Connected.

08:15.625 --> 08:16.458
Rambeau...

08:16.625 --> 08:17.917
what the hell are you doin'?

08:18.083 --> 08:22.083
Seems the surge has had
some residual effect on the jump point.

08:22.250 --> 08:23.833
I'm gonna get you some readings, Fury.

08:24.000 --> 08:24.875
Mon...

08:25.042 --> 08:26.625
-Hello?
-Monica.

08:26.792 --> 08:27.792
Hello?

08:35.332 --> 08:36.292
Was that Monica?

08:37.125 --> 08:38.167
-Aunt Carol?
-Fury...

08:38.332 --> 08:40.417
-was that Monica?
-Why, you wanna talk to her?

08:41.125 --> 08:43.000
I don't think I'm in the best...

08:43.167 --> 08:45.875
position to... I... I don't...

08:46.042 --> 08:47.292
I don't wanna...

08:47.458 --> 08:48.292
Look...

08:48.458 --> 08:49.708
I don't wanna talk to her like this.

08:49.875 --> 08:51.917
-Not after all this time.
-You know...

08:52.083 --> 08:54.417
-eventually you're gonna have to talk to her.
-I know.

08:54.583 --> 08:55.542
I know, but...

08:55.708 --> 08:57.917
let's save the family reunions
till I'm back inside.

09:06.583 --> 09:09.000
I think I found the source of the surge.

09:10.000 --> 09:10.958
What are you seeing?

09:12.542 --> 09:16.208
It's a jump point,
but it's not closing. Like...

09:17.000 --> 09:18.250
it's stuck.

09:18.417 --> 09:19.417
Danvers.

09:33.458 --> 09:34.458
Danvers.

09:35.667 --> 09:36.667
Danvers!

09:42.875 --> 09:44.833
The jump point's still leaking energy.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.458
-Captain Rambeau?
-Hello?

09:47.417 --> 09:49.542
-Hello?
-Monica.

09:57.417 --> 09:58.708
Beautiful.

10:32.625 --> 10:34.750
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God!

10:40.167 --> 10:42.292
Stop spinning, stop spinning, stop spinning,
please!

10:49.167 --> 10:51.833
It's Nick Fury! Hey!

10:52.000 --> 10:54.208
How did you... Oh, wow.

10:54.375 --> 10:57.583
I'm Kamala Khan.
No, sorry, I'm Ms. Marvel, actually.

10:57.750 --> 10:59.000
But I'm from Jersey City and I...

10:59.167 --> 11:01.292
Oh, no, I don't have my mask on.

11:01.458 --> 11:03.583
Is this an Avengers test?

11:04.167 --> 11:06.292
Who the hell are you?

11:35.917 --> 11:37.417
Hi.

11:37.583 --> 11:38.667
Really good living room.

11:41.875 --> 11:43.167
-Kamala?
-Kamala?

11:51.750 --> 11:52.875
What did you do to me?

11:53.042 --> 11:55.208
-What is Dar-Benn doing?
-It's too late.

11:55.375 --> 11:58.125
The Supremor's already on Tarnax.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.125
You can't stop this.

12:00.292 --> 12:01.500
Watch me.

12:15.542 --> 12:17.333
Fury. It's the Kree.

12:17.500 --> 12:19.292
They're going after the Skrulls on Tarnax.

12:19.458 --> 12:22.667
Now, hold on.
Do not go in swinging.

12:22.833 --> 12:25.167
-This is a peace and reconciliation tour.
-Fury.

12:25.333 --> 12:27.083
-I got this.
-Carol...

12:29.958 --> 12:32.333
So, I switched with someone
named Kamala Khan?

12:32.500 --> 12:34.542
Yeah.
She seemed to be as confused as you are.

12:34.708 --> 12:36.750
Well, there's nothing in her power-set
about teleportation.

12:36.917 --> 12:37.875
Enough about her.

12:38.042 --> 12:40.500
I wanna know what happened
to you on MB-418.

12:40.792 --> 12:42.333
Yes, sir.

12:42.500 --> 12:44.917
Let me preface this by saying
I'm not really sure. But...

12:45.083 --> 12:48.125
I did not break my closet door, okay?
I was in space.

12:48.292 --> 12:51.792
-Oh, so it broke itself?
-No, no, no. See, I disappeared.

12:51.958 --> 12:53.917
So maybe Captain Marvel broke it.

12:54.250 --> 12:57.458
-What?
-Yes, your friend, Captain Marvel.

12:57.625 --> 12:59.542
She was walking up and down
our living room...

12:59.708 --> 13:00.708
and now you come back...

13:00.875 --> 13:04.625
-waltzing in with no apologies.
-I'm sorry, Captain Marvel was in our house?

13:04.792 --> 13:07.625
Is Captain Marvel pressuring you in any way?

13:08.042 --> 13:11.292
Look, I understand that she's
an important figure and all that...

13:11.458 --> 13:12.625
but you don't have to do as she says.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.917
No, no, they're clearly working together.

13:15.083 --> 13:16.583
-Look at her face. Look at her smile.
-Aamir, stop it.

13:16.750 --> 13:18.833
-She's being super secretive as always.
-Aamir, stop picking on your sister.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.042
-Look at her.
-Muneeba.

13:20.208 --> 13:21.667
Kamala, are you lying again?

13:21.833 --> 13:23.750
-Just tell me if you're involved or...
-My daughter has said she's not lying.

13:23.917 --> 13:24.917
-Kamala.
-Looks like she's having...

13:25.083 --> 13:26.083
-so much fun.
-Muneeba...

13:26.250 --> 13:27.667
-She's bad at keeping secrets.
-Oh, my God! It's happening!

13:35.875 --> 13:37.958
Approaching Tarnax.

13:42.458 --> 13:43.458
Warning.

13:43.625 --> 13:45.083
Kree ship detected.

14:32.833 --> 14:34.917
This is not what we agreed, Dar-Benn.

14:35.083 --> 14:36.292
Supremor Dar-Benn.

14:36.458 --> 14:37.417
The Skrull...

14:37.583 --> 14:40.792
have been scattered
to every corner of the universe.

14:40.958 --> 14:44.125
Made refugees wherever we go, and still...

14:44.667 --> 14:48.917
we came into these negotiations
in good faith.

14:49.083 --> 14:50.917
I hear you, Dro'ge.

14:52.417 --> 14:56.333
I, perhaps more than anyone, understand what
you and your people have been through.

14:56.917 --> 14:59.750
After my predecessor was destroyed...

14:59.917 --> 15:02.167
heretics rose up to fill the void.

15:04.042 --> 15:07.750
The Civil War has polluted our skies.
My people cannot breathe.

15:10.292 --> 15:11.750
Our sun is dying.

15:12.208 --> 15:14.417
Hala is out of time.

15:14.750 --> 15:17.167
I hope we can rebuild together.

15:17.500 --> 15:21.417
So much so that I'm willing
to put our ancient animosities behind us.

15:22.958 --> 15:25.250
And give you a chance to protect your people.

15:27.042 --> 15:28.375
To stop running.

15:32.208 --> 15:35.500
The Skrull will take their rightful place
in the Kree Empire.

15:37.458 --> 15:39.542
And I will aid in their relocation.

15:39.708 --> 15:41.167
-Relocation?
-What?

15:41.917 --> 15:43.792
-What?
-What is the meaning of this?

15:45.417 --> 15:49.167
I would hate for your people to suffocate
when I strip the atmosphere.

16:07.833 --> 16:09.333
It's the Annihilator!

16:23.750 --> 16:25.500
Oh, my God!

16:36.542 --> 16:39.333
-What the hell is going on?
-Yes, what the hell is going on?

16:39.500 --> 16:41.333
I was on some freaky spaceship
and then I teleported here.

16:41.500 --> 16:42.458
I don't know if that's my new power.

16:42.625 --> 16:44.750
-And then this freaking cat ate a man.
-How can a cat eat a man, Kamala?

16:44.917 --> 16:45.833
I don't know. It has tentacles...

16:46.000 --> 16:46.958
-and it ate a man.
-What tentacles, Kamala?

16:47.125 --> 16:48.042
-I don't know.
-Where are the tentacles?

16:48.208 --> 16:49.500
It comes out of his mouth,
and they're...

16:50.500 --> 16:51.625
-Oh, my God!
-Oh!

16:51.792 --> 16:54.167
Oh, my God,
it's happening again!

16:58.500 --> 17:02.042
-Oh, no, no, no.
-Kamala, who are they?

17:04.833 --> 17:05.708
Please run.

17:10.083 --> 17:12.416
How did you get here,
and how're you involved in this?

17:12.583 --> 17:16.041
-The Kree jury-rigged a wormhole on MB-418.
-You mean like a jump point?

17:16.208 --> 17:19.791
-I don't know. But I touched it and then I...
-Why'd you do that?

17:19.958 --> 17:21.333
Because it was glowing and mysterious.

17:21.708 --> 17:24.958
Okay, new rule, no more touching shit.
Especially glowing, mysterious shit.

17:25.125 --> 17:26.625
Okay, I'm feeling a lot of
negative energy from you...

17:26.791 --> 17:28.750
and I don't like it. That's not the point.
The point is...

17:28.917 --> 17:32.000
is that it was siphoning off
the atmosphere. And it did this!

17:32.167 --> 17:33.333
Scissors beat paper.

17:33.667 --> 17:36.917
Fury! There was, like,
energy that went around my hand. Focus.

17:37.417 --> 17:38.500
Okay, maybe if I do this.

17:45.833 --> 17:46.750
Annihilator.

17:46.958 --> 17:47.958
I don't like that name.

18:20.292 --> 18:22.333
-Friends of yours?
-Hi.

18:48.625 --> 18:50.000
Annihilator!

19:10.292 --> 19:11.792
Annihilator!

19:43.458 --> 19:44.750
Aamir, get him!

19:45.333 --> 19:46.458
Get him! Hit him!

20:02.333 --> 20:03.333
Yusuf!

20:11.292 --> 20:15.000
Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!

20:30.708 --> 20:32.375
Kamala, are you okay?

20:37.750 --> 20:38.750
Fury!

20:39.125 --> 20:42.417
I think I'm getting teleported whenever I
channel any kind of radiant...

20:44.917 --> 20:46.542
I think I switch when I use my powers.

20:46.708 --> 20:47.875
Strong theory.

20:55.875 --> 20:57.083
Strong theory.

20:57.667 --> 21:00.583
Our tests keep generating the same result.

21:00.750 --> 21:05.083
With each new jump point,
this band becomes more unstable.

21:05.250 --> 21:07.708
I strongly suggest we wait
for the second band.

21:57.375 --> 21:58.375
Oi.

22:00.333 --> 22:01.792
Hi, again.

22:02.667 --> 22:04.750
So sorry about earlier.

22:04.917 --> 22:06.500
We're looking for Kamala Khan.

22:07.292 --> 22:08.792
Did I get in?

22:09.500 --> 22:12.333
-Is this the new iPad? I haven't seen it yet.
-They wish!

22:12.500 --> 22:13.458
-All right. Come on, let's go.
-I know. Wait...

22:13.625 --> 22:16.375
if this is all top secret information,
why is it on a clear case?

22:16.542 --> 22:17.375
Well...

22:17.750 --> 22:20.208
just... swipe it a little bit... Hi.

22:20.375 --> 22:23.292
-Okay.
-Can you believe it? They have intel on me.

22:23.458 --> 22:24.583
On me!

22:25.333 --> 22:26.500
I am intel.

22:27.083 --> 22:27.917
Look at you!

22:29.583 --> 22:31.542
Hey, what does S.A.B.E.R. stand for?

22:31.708 --> 22:33.458
Strategic Aerospace Biophysics...

22:33.625 --> 22:36.167
-and Exolinguistic Response.
-That's classified.

22:36.542 --> 22:37.542
Sorry.

22:38.417 --> 22:40.000
"Hard Light powers,"
yes.

22:40.167 --> 22:42.500
-"Noor..."
-Okay, but why do you have intel on her?

22:42.667 --> 22:44.375
Is there some sort of surveillance on us?

22:44.542 --> 22:46.833
-"Surveillance" is a strong word.
-Well, ma'am...

22:47.000 --> 22:49.958
your daughter is the hero
that saved Jersey City.

22:50.292 --> 22:53.125
So, of course we would have intel
on someone like her. And you're also...

22:53.292 --> 22:55.708
-electromagnetically altered.
-What does that mean?

22:55.875 --> 22:58.458
Oh, it just means that we both have...

22:58.625 --> 23:00.375
light-based powers.

23:01.250 --> 23:02.833
What's your code name?

23:03.000 --> 23:04.417
Oh, I don't have a code name.

23:04.583 --> 23:05.958
-We'll workshop it.
-No, thank you.

23:06.833 --> 23:07.833
Aunt Carol...

23:08.000 --> 23:10.708
Captain Marvel also has light-based powers.

23:10.875 --> 23:12.250
It's probably not a coincidence.

23:12.417 --> 23:15.333
Not to mention the two of you
came into direct contact...

23:15.500 --> 23:17.208
with some malfunctioning jump points.

23:17.750 --> 23:21.375
I still cannot believe that Captain Marvel
was here and I didn't even get to meet her.

23:21.542 --> 23:22.958
You know, we're supposed to be
all, like "twinsies!" you know.

23:23.125 --> 23:25.875
We have the same name.
I would obviously, then...

23:26.042 --> 23:28.083
I don't know, I would just give her
the letter I wrote for her...

23:28.250 --> 23:30.167
and we would go out for lunch,
and then it would just...

23:30.708 --> 23:33.167
Did you say "Aunt Carol?"

23:34.542 --> 23:36.875
I said that Captain Marvel...

23:37.042 --> 23:38.792
can absorb light energy.

23:38.958 --> 23:40.083
I can see it.

23:40.250 --> 23:42.417
And you, you can turn light...

23:42.583 --> 23:44.083
into physical matter.

23:44.250 --> 23:45.667
Which I have never heard of.

23:45.833 --> 23:47.250
-But my working theory...
-I could totally show you.

23:47.417 --> 23:48.583
No!

23:50.792 --> 23:51.792
What the...

23:56.083 --> 23:57.083
Hi.

23:58.042 --> 23:59.042
Hi.

24:00.208 --> 24:02.208
Nah, they don't seem related.

24:03.417 --> 24:06.208
Whatever, Yusuf. Families are complicated.

24:06.917 --> 24:11.667
Monica, you wanna fill Carol in
on your working theory?

24:12.208 --> 24:13.250
Yeah.

24:13.417 --> 24:15.292
Hi, Captain Marvel.

24:16.750 --> 24:19.500
It is so good to see you,
Lieutenant Trouble.

24:19.667 --> 24:20.750
You too.

24:20.917 --> 24:22.500
And it's Captain Rambeau now.

24:23.833 --> 24:25.708
Right. Sorry.

24:28.875 --> 24:30.208
So, what's new?

24:30.375 --> 24:31.667
-Where's my sister?
-Yeah.

24:31.833 --> 24:36.083
I'm thinking that our joint exposure
to these unsteady jump points...

24:36.250 --> 24:39.375
and our susceptibility to
electromagnetic energy...

24:39.542 --> 24:42.917
-has temporarily entangled our world-lines.
-Yeah, that, right there.

24:44.667 --> 24:47.458
Entanglement.
Our light powers are entangled.

24:47.625 --> 24:50.500
So, we switch places
whenever we use them at the same time.

24:50.667 --> 24:52.542
-Which would mean Kamala...
-When did you get powers?

24:53.167 --> 24:55.500
I walked through
a radiation shielding barrier...

24:55.667 --> 24:57.833
of a witch hex
and now I can manipulate and see...

24:58.000 --> 24:59.917
all wavelengths
of the electromagnetic spectrum.

25:00.083 --> 25:02.333
I'm very happy for you. Yeah.

25:02.500 --> 25:04.958
-Where's our daughter?
-Yes, please. Where is Kamala?

25:05.125 --> 25:06.208
Wherever you were.

25:06.375 --> 25:07.583
-Where were you?
-Who's Kamala?

25:07.875 --> 25:09.792
The third person we're switching with.

25:09.958 --> 25:13.375
-Light powers. Teenage girl. Where were you?
-What are you doing?

25:13.542 --> 25:15.542
-What are you doing?
-I'm trying to switch.

25:15.708 --> 25:17.292
-Why isn't it working when I need it to work?
-Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

25:17.458 --> 25:18.333
-Danvers, Danvers!
-Hey!

25:18.500 --> 25:21.333
-So confused.
-Tell Kamala that her Abu is very upset.

25:21.500 --> 25:23.042
Where are we going
and why are we going there?

25:23.208 --> 25:25.875
-Carol!
-Carol, where you going?

25:36.083 --> 25:37.875
-Oh, my God!
-Uh-oh!

25:38.042 --> 25:40.000
Monica, you gotta fly.

25:40.167 --> 25:41.375
No, no, no. I...

25:41.542 --> 25:42.583
I mean, I know.

25:42.750 --> 25:44.250
But technically, I haven't done that yet!

25:44.417 --> 25:45.917
Yeah, well, you got to now...

25:46.083 --> 25:48.167
or Kamala's not gonna graduate
from high school.

25:48.333 --> 25:49.583
Come on! Use your core!

25:53.375 --> 25:54.417
Oh, jeez.

25:54.583 --> 25:56.375
Hey. Black Girl Magic.

26:17.583 --> 26:19.333
I got you! I got you!

26:19.667 --> 26:20.667
I got you!

26:22.083 --> 26:23.125
Oops!

26:40.458 --> 26:43.625
Hold on!

26:43.792 --> 26:45.292
What is happening?

26:45.458 --> 26:47.375
I can't hold on to you while I'm flying.

26:49.167 --> 26:52.042
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

26:52.208 --> 26:53.583
-We're gonna die!
-Hold on!

26:53.750 --> 26:55.542
Hold on! I'm thinking, I'm thinking!

26:55.708 --> 26:57.792
Wait, I have an idea.

26:57.958 --> 26:59.083
Grab on to me!

27:01.750 --> 27:04.333
This had better work!

27:07.167 --> 27:08.333
Oh, it's cool. It's Carol.

27:13.875 --> 27:16.083
Okay, no powers, no powers. Just...

27:28.417 --> 27:29.625
Who are they?

27:29.792 --> 27:33.375
They are associates of Captain Marvel.

27:36.125 --> 27:37.667
The Annihilator is here?

27:37.833 --> 27:41.417
Yeah, well, she was.
And then these two just sort of appeared.

27:41.583 --> 27:42.708
What about the band?

27:42.875 --> 27:44.375
If she's meddling, I need to strike now.

27:44.542 --> 27:47.833
Yeah. I still can't account for the
instabilities exhibited on MB-418.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.708
-This thing does much more than just...
-But it works?

27:52.292 --> 27:54.333
Yes. Yes. But if you give me more time...

27:54.500 --> 27:56.167
-I can make it safer.
-No.

27:56.333 --> 27:58.167
No. We do it now.

27:59.167 --> 28:01.458
Before the Annihilator appears.

28:19.375 --> 28:23.083
What should we do about... these two?

28:37.250 --> 28:38.667
You.

28:41.250 --> 28:42.417
Hold that thought.

29:12.125 --> 29:13.292
We gotta get that band off of her.

29:13.458 --> 29:15.083
It looks like mine.

29:15.250 --> 29:16.375
Guys!

29:26.375 --> 29:28.083
I can't fly.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.625
Do you guys have
a spaceship I could borrow or...

29:31.792 --> 29:32.833
Kamala, don't talk to them.

29:33.375 --> 29:34.917
You know my name!

29:44.958 --> 29:47.167
The Kree came here hopeful...

29:47.333 --> 29:50.750
-that we could build a covenant of peace.
-What have you done?

29:51.583 --> 29:54.583
But then you sic the Annihilator on us.

29:56.125 --> 29:57.750
Like we're vermin.

29:59.417 --> 30:03.375
Once again,
the Skrull have betrayed the Kree.

30:04.417 --> 30:05.625
And for that...

30:31.708 --> 30:33.250
Carol, we gotta get these people out of here.

30:34.083 --> 30:35.333
Emperor Dro'ge...

30:35.500 --> 30:37.583
you need to evacuate your people now.

30:39.583 --> 30:41.208
We have nowhere to go.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.875
Carol, the ships...

31:09.542 --> 31:11.125
they're not gonna make it.

31:13.042 --> 31:14.958
Get back to the ship
and don't use your powers.

31:15.125 --> 31:16.667
-But I can help.
-Now.

32:12.625 --> 32:14.500
-Let's go.
-Where's Kamala?

32:17.125 --> 32:18.292
Kamala!

32:30.375 --> 32:31.375
No!

32:40.750 --> 32:42.458
Let's go, let's go!

32:53.000 --> 32:55.458
-Come on!
-Keep moving...

32:55.625 --> 32:57.208
please, please.

33:00.458 --> 33:02.500
-All these people, they're gonna...
-Come on, sweetie.

33:02.667 --> 33:04.292
-No! How can you just leave them here?
-Kamala, now!

33:04.458 --> 33:06.250
We need to save who we can.

33:46.417 --> 33:48.292
Transmission sent.

33:54.583 --> 33:55.583
Hey.

33:55.917 --> 33:57.167
This peace treaty...

33:58.208 --> 33:59.208
it was a good thing.

34:00.500 --> 34:02.667
-It was a ruse.
-If it were...

34:03.500 --> 34:05.417
your intervention failed.

34:06.083 --> 34:09.083
We don't need your help anymore.

34:12.667 --> 34:14.250
I called a friend.

34:14.417 --> 34:16.083
She can find a safe place for you.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.208
Is that okay?

34:19.042 --> 34:20.625
We have no choice.

34:23.708 --> 34:24.708
Incoming.

34:38.917 --> 34:40.333
Are you all right?

34:45.500 --> 34:46.667
Thank you again.

34:47.167 --> 34:48.542
Always.

34:48.708 --> 34:50.917
I see that you've finally
found yourself a team.

34:51.083 --> 34:52.083
It is unintentional.

34:52.250 --> 34:54.458
Oh, I've been
on some unintentional teams myself.

34:54.958 --> 34:59.625
-I know, but...
-You can stand tall without standing alone.

35:01.250 --> 35:02.542
Take it from me, Marv.

35:10.833 --> 35:11.833
Hey.

35:13.167 --> 35:14.792
Captain Marvel will fix this.

35:15.500 --> 35:16.917
I promise.

35:31.333 --> 35:32.958
Thank you.

35:35.917 --> 35:38.417
May our next meeting be joyful.

36:20.375 --> 36:21.375
Breathe.

36:34.083 --> 36:35.500
Do you remember?

36:36.708 --> 36:39.875
When the sun used to shine on Hala?

36:41.542 --> 36:43.667
How beautiful our home was?

36:46.708 --> 36:48.042
Before her?

36:54.208 --> 36:56.167
Before the Annihilator.

36:59.167 --> 37:00.333
I was there.

37:07.167 --> 37:08.792
I heard her lies...

37:09.583 --> 37:11.792
claiming she was there to set us free.

37:13.375 --> 37:16.500
But when she destroyed
the Supreme Intelligence...

37:17.208 --> 37:19.167
she destroyed the Kree.

37:26.250 --> 37:29.875
For 30 years I have been fighting
alongside you.

37:30.917 --> 37:32.875
Not only have I brought you peace...

37:33.583 --> 37:36.958
but I have found a way
to return Hala to glory.

37:38.125 --> 37:39.042
Supremor!

37:40.125 --> 37:41.000
Supremor!

37:43.542 --> 37:47.208
We need more power than that band
can provide if we're to reignite our sun.

37:48.125 --> 37:49.458
That amount of energy...

37:49.833 --> 37:50.958
Well, it would kill you.

37:51.875 --> 37:53.458
If my life is the cost, so be it.

37:53.625 --> 37:55.333
We will find the other in time, Suprem...

37:55.500 --> 37:57.125
There is no more time.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.833
Hala is out of time.

38:23.458 --> 38:24.583
Need a hand?

38:28.250 --> 38:29.250
Yeah.

38:41.500 --> 38:43.458
Will you hand me that laser?
Three micrometres.

38:48.375 --> 38:49.208
Wow.

38:49.958 --> 38:52.375
So you can do that
because you walked through a witch hex?

38:52.542 --> 38:53.875
Yep.

38:54.042 --> 38:57.458
When I got blipped back,
they weren't sending us to space anymore.

38:57.625 --> 39:00.750
Grounded us to investigate
earthbound anomalies.

39:01.333 --> 39:02.625
That must have been hard.

39:02.792 --> 39:05.917
Your mom told me that you
always dreamed of going to space.

39:06.083 --> 39:07.333
That you had something to prove.

39:07.500 --> 39:09.375
You said you'd be back before I knew it.

39:10.500 --> 39:11.625
What?

39:12.000 --> 39:13.375
When you left...

39:14.208 --> 39:17.125
you said you'd be back before I knew it.

39:19.583 --> 39:22.375
I meant what I said. I just,
I didn't know...

39:22.542 --> 39:25.208
what I was getting myself into.

39:25.375 --> 39:27.792
I didn't know how to explain
to a little girl that...

39:27.958 --> 39:32.000
A little girl that hung on your every word.

39:35.542 --> 39:37.208
If you knew...

39:38.542 --> 39:40.417
I was going to come back.

39:40.583 --> 39:42.000
I just...

39:42.583 --> 39:44.417
There was people that needed me.

39:45.333 --> 39:47.000
We needed you, Carol.

40:06.250 --> 40:07.250
Hey.

40:07.417 --> 40:09.583
I hope you don't mind.
I didn't have any other clothes.

40:09.750 --> 40:11.417
It's totally fine.

40:11.583 --> 40:12.917
Looks good on you.

40:15.958 --> 40:16.792
I...

40:17.833 --> 40:19.208
I'm really sorry...

40:19.375 --> 40:20.417
for the way I spoke to you.

40:22.375 --> 40:23.375
Thank you.

40:25.500 --> 40:27.917
I know that this situation isn't ideal...

40:28.292 --> 40:30.792
but it is actually nice...

40:31.625 --> 40:33.458
having people on board again.

40:35.833 --> 40:37.542
It gets pretty lonely out here.

40:37.708 --> 40:41.250
Anytime you need company, I will be there.
I will drop everything. I will...

40:41.417 --> 40:42.833
I will drop high school.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.375
Don't do that.

40:45.250 --> 40:46.583
But can we start again?

40:48.167 --> 40:51.042
Hi, I'm Carol Danvers.

40:52.625 --> 40:53.625
I am Kamala Khan.

40:53.792 --> 40:55.958
But when I'm fighting crime
on the streets of Jersey City...

40:56.125 --> 40:58.792
I go by Ms. Marvel, and I hope
that's okay, like, copyright-wise.

40:58.958 --> 41:00.542
Because, honestly,
I never thought I'd ever get to meet you.

41:00.708 --> 41:02.625
But now that it's happening and we're,
like, touching each other...

41:02.792 --> 41:04.667
I've realized I should have
asked permission.

41:05.500 --> 41:09.125
So, twinsies.

41:10.208 --> 41:11.958
Okay. All right.

41:12.125 --> 41:14.042
Here's what we're gonna do.

41:14.333 --> 41:16.083
-Captain Marvel.
-You need to stop calling me that.

41:16.250 --> 41:17.833
-I used to change your diapers.
-Oh, that was once.

41:18.000 --> 41:19.750
And then I was told
you proceeded to vomit everywhere.

41:19.917 --> 41:20.917
First of all...

41:21.083 --> 41:22.708
it's my ship, so I make the game plan.

41:22.875 --> 41:24.750
Oh, I'm sorry.
When's the last time you led a team?

41:24.917 --> 41:26.333
As early as last week.

41:26.500 --> 41:27.375
Goose doesn't count.

41:27.542 --> 41:28.792
Please. You try giving Goose orders.

41:28.958 --> 41:30.042
Oh, my God, we're a team?

41:30.208 --> 41:32.125
-We're not... We're not a team.
-No, no, no, we're not a team.

41:33.208 --> 41:35.667
I, Kamala Khan of Jersey City...

41:35.833 --> 41:39.000
am on a team with Captain Marvel
and Captain Monica Rambeau...

41:39.167 --> 41:41.667
who from this point onwards
will now be known as...

41:43.417 --> 41:44.708
-Professor Marvel.
-Oh!

41:44.875 --> 41:47.167
-Professor Marvel.
-No.

41:47.333 --> 41:50.583
-No, no, she, she will not. But thank you.
-The Marvels.

41:50.917 --> 41:53.875
Now that we've got that out of the way,
team, I've been trying to tell you...

41:54.042 --> 41:55.917
I think I know how she's making
the weird jump points.

41:57.083 --> 41:58.083
She has one of these.

41:58.958 --> 42:00.458
It's my nani's bangle.

42:00.833 --> 42:03.000
It started glowing really weirdly...

42:03.167 --> 42:05.750
when Dar-Benn opened
that first jump point. Also...

42:05.917 --> 42:08.708
it once traveled me through space and time...

42:08.875 --> 42:10.583
so that's probably related.

42:11.833 --> 42:13.375
What you're describing is a Quantum Band.

42:13.875 --> 42:15.125
I mean, I knew there were two of these.

42:15.292 --> 42:17.250
I just did not expect the other one
to be in space.

42:18.042 --> 42:20.542
They're a pair?
How do you have a Quantum Band?

42:20.708 --> 42:22.208
Okay. What is a Quantum Band?

42:22.375 --> 42:26.375
A myth. Or I thought it was a myth.
It's an ancient artifact.

42:27.792 --> 42:30.000
So this is what Dar-Benn found on
MB-418.

42:30.167 --> 42:32.875
And then her and Kamala just happened
to stumble into each other?

42:33.042 --> 42:34.625
I mean, what are the chances?

42:34.792 --> 42:37.000
"What you seek is seeking you."

42:37.375 --> 42:39.083
It's inscribed on the bangle.

42:39.250 --> 42:41.208
If the Kree legends are true...

42:41.375 --> 42:45.125
the Quantum Bands were used
to create every jump point in the universe.

42:45.292 --> 42:46.417
Teleportation network.

42:46.875 --> 42:50.667
Two Quantum Bands working in unison
to connect the galaxy.

42:50.833 --> 42:54.208
So that would explain
our switch-y entanglement situation.

42:54.375 --> 42:57.250
Yeah, yeah, but Dar-Benn only has one.

42:57.417 --> 43:01.458
She must be overloading it with the
energy from her space hammer thingy.

43:01.625 --> 43:02.625
It's called the Universal Weapon.

43:02.792 --> 43:05.167
Oh, really? I was gonna call it Cosmi-Rod.

43:05.333 --> 43:09.333
Either way, she's using it to force
unstable jump points into the grid.

43:09.875 --> 43:12.417
We have got to get to her
before she makes another one.

43:12.875 --> 43:15.125
She had star charts and maps
on the screens on her ship.

43:15.292 --> 43:17.500
Okay. To where?

43:18.292 --> 43:20.375
-To the stars?
-Okay.

43:21.167 --> 43:22.958
It's fine. Got a plan.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.042
We will use this.

43:25.333 --> 43:27.167
-Is that...?
-A Skrull torture device.

43:27.333 --> 43:29.542
And, wait, we put it on our heads?

43:29.708 --> 43:33.375
Yes, it's fine.
You use it to access memories.

43:33.542 --> 43:35.292
I've been using it...

43:35.458 --> 43:37.833
to regain the memories
that the Kree took from me.

43:39.083 --> 43:40.083
Still?

43:40.458 --> 43:41.458
Yeah.

43:41.625 --> 43:43.458
But, you know, it has a lot of other uses.

43:44.333 --> 43:45.250
It's safe.

43:45.750 --> 43:47.208
You might wanna get comfortable.

43:54.542 --> 43:56.208
This is weird.

43:57.333 --> 43:58.542
Wait. Go back.

44:00.458 --> 44:03.333
Her band absorbs your energy
and redirects it.

44:03.500 --> 44:07.042
It's like you gave her power
to use against you.

44:08.583 --> 44:09.583
Kamala?

44:11.583 --> 44:12.542
What about this?

44:12.708 --> 44:15.458
There! Those coordinates.
Can you read that?

44:15.625 --> 44:17.292
Yes. The Magellanic Galaxy.

44:19.792 --> 44:21.583
All right, the pilot seat's all you.

44:21.750 --> 44:24.875
Is that you, Monica? You're so cute!

44:26.292 --> 44:27.292
No, wait.

44:27.458 --> 44:28.542
Carol, what are you doing?

44:32.458 --> 44:33.750
Why'd you ask me to come, Maria?

44:33.917 --> 44:34.917
Mom.

44:36.917 --> 44:38.375
The cancer's back.

44:39.667 --> 44:41.750
So I need you to take care of Goose.

44:43.625 --> 44:44.917
-No.
-What do you mean "no?"

44:45.083 --> 44:46.792
No, I mean, you beat it once.
You'll beat it again.

44:46.958 --> 44:47.958
Carol...

44:48.125 --> 44:50.792
-I'm not taking the cat.
-It's not a cat.

44:52.875 --> 44:54.708
It should've been you that day.

44:55.583 --> 44:57.625
That stupid race to the hangar.

44:57.792 --> 44:59.958
I never wanted to be Captain Marvel.

45:00.625 --> 45:03.125
Captain Rambeau suits me just fine.

45:03.583 --> 45:06.208
And it's just until Monica gets back.

45:08.750 --> 45:09.917
She blipped.

45:10.083 --> 45:11.542
Carol, I don't wanna relive this.

45:11.708 --> 45:12.875
I'm sorry.

45:17.167 --> 45:18.958
Stop now, please, Carol!

45:19.125 --> 45:20.750
Remember why you're out there.

45:21.042 --> 45:23.667
-I'm looking for a patient in room 104.
-I don't know. I don't know what to tell you.

45:24.000 --> 45:25.417
And remember to come home.

45:25.750 --> 45:27.750
Your mom, she died, honey.

45:27.958 --> 45:29.625
No. No, no, no!

45:34.750 --> 45:35.750
Never do that again.

45:35.917 --> 45:37.708
I'm sorry. It wasn't on purpose.

45:37.875 --> 45:38.917
Wait, so your mom...

45:39.083 --> 45:41.583
Passed away while I was blipped.

45:42.458 --> 45:43.458
And when I came back...

45:44.000 --> 45:45.375
no one was there.

45:51.583 --> 45:53.167
Okay.

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
Thank you.

46:05.167 --> 46:07.417
She seemed really cool. I'm sorry.

46:07.958 --> 46:09.292
She was.

46:09.667 --> 46:10.833
She was the best.

46:13.333 --> 46:16.292
Well, we have to make do
with what we know right now.

46:17.292 --> 46:19.250
Here is what we do know.

46:19.500 --> 46:21.583
The Universal Neural Teleportation Network...

46:21.750 --> 46:25.250
is a system of wormholes through
the space-time continuum aka, jump points...

46:25.417 --> 46:28.125
which allows us to hop
between different planetary systems.

46:28.292 --> 46:31.958
Basically, it stretches and reconfigures
space without rupturing the continuum.

46:32.542 --> 46:35.250
Like fracking, the more holes you drill...

46:35.417 --> 46:38.917
the more destabilized the shale becomes
and then... earthquake.

46:41.125 --> 46:43.417
Bottom line, if she keeps creating
these jump points...

46:43.583 --> 46:45.208
it's gonna get really bad, really fast.

46:45.583 --> 46:47.958
Question is, what does she want?

46:48.917 --> 46:52.000
Tarnax used to be occupied by the Kree, so...

46:52.167 --> 46:53.625
maybe the attack was a warning?

46:53.792 --> 46:55.750
So, she could be after another former colony?

46:55.917 --> 46:57.542
Is there a former Kree colony
in the Magellanic?

46:57.708 --> 47:01.708
At one point the Kree colonized 25%
of the galaxy, so...

47:01.875 --> 47:03.792
If all she wanted was to destroy Tarnax...

47:03.958 --> 47:06.458
why not bring in an army
or use a bomb or something?

47:06.625 --> 47:07.667
Why a jump point?

47:07.833 --> 47:10.833
You're right. Jump points aren't weapons,
they're means of transportation.

47:11.000 --> 47:12.667
Every jump point has two sides...

47:12.875 --> 47:15.083
so if Tarnax's atmosphere
was siphoned away...

47:15.667 --> 47:17.917
-it had to go somewhere, or...
-Hala.

47:20.042 --> 47:21.583
The Kree Civil War...

47:21.750 --> 47:23.708
basically bankrupted Hala
of its natural resources.

47:23.875 --> 47:25.125
The air is barely breathable...

47:25.292 --> 47:27.042
-they're suffering from a drought.
-A drought?

47:27.208 --> 47:29.250
So, she could be after water next.

47:29.417 --> 47:33.125
-Okay. Where in the Magellanic can we find...
-Aladna.

47:34.958 --> 47:37.250
Oceans cover 99.63% of the planet.

47:37.417 --> 47:40.125
That is a very specific stat.
You've been there.

47:42.458 --> 47:43.458
Yeah.

47:44.375 --> 47:45.208
Yeah.

47:48.083 --> 47:49.417
She said that really weird.

47:49.583 --> 47:50.542
-Yeah. Why are you being weird?
-Okay.

47:50.708 --> 47:52.375
Consensus on Aladna.

47:54.708 --> 47:57.292
-Aye.
-Yeah, I say we do it.

47:57.458 --> 48:00.250
Get to Aladna
and separate Dar-Benn from that bangle.

48:00.417 --> 48:01.917
We have our heading.

48:02.083 --> 48:06.542
Kamala, you are not going
on any space adventures.

48:06.708 --> 48:09.375
Nicholas has told me
how dangerous they can be.

48:09.542 --> 48:11.833
It's just "Fury." God.

48:12.417 --> 48:13.667
Wait. Where are you guys? Where is Abu?

48:14.333 --> 48:17.750
Hell. This man has taken us to Hell.

48:19.792 --> 48:21.708
Hell? So that means I'm the devil?

48:21.875 --> 48:24.500
-Really, Fury?
-They insisted,

48:24.667 --> 48:27.250
and your dad is not adjusting very well
to space travel.

48:27.417 --> 48:31.083
Hey, babe, so I'm in this crazy
space elevator and we're going up.

48:32.250 --> 48:34.542
Or maybe we're going down.

48:34.708 --> 48:37.167
-Are there directions in space?
-Yes, there are.

48:37.333 --> 48:38.500
But no filming.

48:38.667 --> 48:40.167
Oh. Okay.

48:41.000 --> 48:42.333
Help me.

48:43.375 --> 48:44.375
Whoa.

48:52.042 --> 48:54.000
Fury, everything okay?

48:54.167 --> 48:55.292
We've had another surge.

48:55.458 --> 48:57.375
Reports are coming in across the network.

48:57.542 --> 48:59.167
It seems everyone's been affected.

48:59.333 --> 49:01.875
Well, we need to stop her
from making another one...

49:02.042 --> 49:04.583
and we can't risk intergalactic body swapping
in the meantime.

49:05.000 --> 49:08.125
Mrs. Khan, I'm sorry, but your daughter
will have to stay aboard my ship...

49:08.292 --> 49:09.875
-until we can get to the bottom of this.
-Oh, no, no, no.

49:10.042 --> 49:10.875
Yes!

49:11.042 --> 49:12.292
You will let her go.

49:12.458 --> 49:15.625
Mrs. Khan, it is not that simple.

49:15.792 --> 49:17.500
We need Kamala.

49:18.250 --> 49:19.667
Ammi, we found Nani's other bangle...

49:19.833 --> 49:21.583
and there's this weirdly beautiful
but kind of terrifying woman...

49:21.750 --> 49:23.750
using the other one to hurt people.
And we have to stop her.

49:23.917 --> 49:25.208
You're telling me there's another bangle.

49:25.375 --> 49:27.917
And they're going to use that bangle
to hurt you?

49:28.083 --> 49:29.083
Monica will take care of her.

49:29.250 --> 49:32.500
We will. And we will make sure
she gets back home in one piece.

49:32.667 --> 49:33.667
I promise.

49:34.042 --> 49:35.208
Stay the course.

49:35.375 --> 49:37.833
We'll figure out
how to close those jump points.

49:38.000 --> 49:40.583
Kamala, you listen to me.

49:40.750 --> 49:42.083
If anything happens to you...

49:42.250 --> 49:43.792
I will kill her.

49:43.958 --> 49:45.125
You tell her that.

49:46.792 --> 49:48.375
I love you, beta.

49:48.542 --> 49:49.625
I love you more.

49:49.792 --> 49:51.792
-Wait, what did she just say?
-Nothing.

49:52.750 --> 49:55.583
Nobody cares more than Captain Marvel...

49:55.750 --> 49:57.250
and nobody gets more grief for it.

49:57.417 --> 50:00.417
Trust me. Kamala is in good hands with Carol.

50:04.667 --> 50:06.125
What's wrong with that cat?

50:07.042 --> 50:08.500
It's acting very weird.

50:08.667 --> 50:11.583
Also, Mr. Fury, she's looking little pudgy.

50:11.958 --> 50:13.708
I think you're overfeeding her.

50:15.458 --> 50:16.458
Goose.

50:20.792 --> 50:21.792
Goose!

50:23.917 --> 50:25.083
Firefly? Night Light.

50:25.250 --> 50:26.917
Countess Marvel. Mistress Marvel?

50:27.083 --> 50:28.167
-Doctor Marvel?
-That's too much.

50:28.625 --> 50:29.792
Doctor Bright.

50:30.667 --> 50:31.958
Professor Marvel.

50:32.125 --> 50:33.958
Nova, Supernova Girl...

50:34.125 --> 50:35.208
-Spectrum, Spectrum-Vision.
-You're doing too much.

50:35.375 --> 50:37.375
Vision! Oh, wait.
No. Sorry.

50:37.542 --> 50:39.500
How many times do I have to tell you guys
I do not want...

50:39.667 --> 50:41.500
-or need a code name?
-Why?

50:41.667 --> 50:44.250
Besides, none of it matters
if we're not coordinated out there.

50:44.417 --> 50:45.500
Wanna figure out the switching thing?

50:48.083 --> 50:50.625
Powers stay activated after a switch.
Good to know.

50:50.792 --> 50:52.792
Okay, everyone together on three.

50:52.958 --> 50:56.042
Ready? One, two, three, go.

50:56.208 --> 50:58.125
Now, why would you say "go"
if we're going on three?

50:58.292 --> 50:59.375
I'm aware.

51:05.875 --> 51:06.875
Now.

51:07.458 --> 51:08.458
Now.

51:08.875 --> 51:09.708
Now.

51:10.125 --> 51:11.125
One, two, three!

51:13.833 --> 51:14.792
She gave me eyes.

51:18.208 --> 51:20.000
Now. Now.

51:20.167 --> 51:21.750
Can you hold on for one second?

51:22.167 --> 51:23.792
Walk. And switch!

51:25.958 --> 51:26.833
Switch!

51:30.875 --> 51:31.792
Hey, I got this!

51:39.292 --> 51:40.292
Yes!

51:43.375 --> 51:44.375
And switch!

51:45.500 --> 51:49.625
That's why you wanna invest in index funds
rather than in individual stocks.

51:49.792 --> 51:54.125
Of course, both a Roth IRA and 401k
are important for tax purposes.

51:54.292 --> 51:56.500
You know, I never even thought
about planning for retirement.

51:56.667 --> 51:58.125
Hey, it's never too late.

51:58.292 --> 52:00.500
And it's never too early, like I say.

52:00.667 --> 52:02.458
-How old are you?
-306.

52:03.208 --> 52:04.208
Wow. Same age.

52:08.292 --> 52:09.417
What was that?

52:09.583 --> 52:11.208
-I'm gonna find out.
-Please.

52:11.375 --> 52:13.500
Foreign object in sector K.

52:13.667 --> 52:15.750
-Sweet Svartalfheim.
-Don't touch it.

52:18.042 --> 52:19.042
What is it?

52:19.208 --> 52:20.875
I haven't the foggiest idea.

52:21.042 --> 52:23.042
-How did it get in there?
-I don't know.

52:24.750 --> 52:26.292
Should we tell Fury?

52:28.000 --> 52:30.417
Twenty seconds to the jump point.

52:30.583 --> 52:32.000
Do you guys realize
how crazy this is right now?

52:32.167 --> 52:34.208
Like, I'm in a spaceship
with two superheroes.

52:34.375 --> 52:35.583
Also, is it too late to go
to the bathroom?

52:35.750 --> 52:37.250
Because I feel like
it's gonna hit really soon.

52:37.417 --> 52:38.417
No one would believe me. Like my...

52:38.583 --> 52:39.833
Nakia, she would never...

53:35.000 --> 53:38.625
Okay. Here we go. Comms.

53:38.792 --> 53:40.000
Wow!

53:40.167 --> 53:42.500
-I've always wanted one of these.
-Thank you.

53:42.667 --> 53:45.375
-Testing. Testing, one, two, three.
-Kamala. Kamala.

53:45.542 --> 53:47.708
We hear you, baby. Thank you.

53:49.000 --> 53:51.792
So, real quick before we get sucked in...

53:51.958 --> 53:53.000
What the hell is that?

53:53.583 --> 53:56.958
I should warn you that
I'm kind of famous here.

53:57.333 --> 53:59.792
Well, you do know
you're famous everywhere, right?

53:59.958 --> 54:03.667
This one's kinda different.
I helped the prince with a legal issue.

54:03.833 --> 54:04.708
Okay.

54:04.875 --> 54:05.958
Mm-hmm. Let's go.

54:06.125 --> 54:07.083
No matter what...

54:07.250 --> 54:08.333
follow my lead.

54:08.500 --> 54:10.333
Aladnean culture is very specific.

54:10.500 --> 54:13.292
So, there's gonna be a bit of a
ceremony we have to do...

54:13.458 --> 54:14.625
but just... stay cool.

54:14.792 --> 54:16.917
Fair Aladna...

54:17.083 --> 54:20.000
it's a peaceful crossroads

54:20.167 --> 54:22.583
Diamond of the quadrant...

54:22.750 --> 54:25.625
Aladna, our home

54:25.833 --> 54:27.125
Hi, small child, could you tell...

54:27.208 --> 54:29.417
Fair Aladna...

54:30.042 --> 54:32.958
as if no time has passed

54:33.125 --> 54:35.958
So excited that you're home

54:36.750 --> 54:40.625
Our princess is home

54:40.792 --> 54:41.667
Princess?

54:47.333 --> 54:48.250
It's a technicality.

54:48.875 --> 54:49.875
Carol. What is happening?

54:50.167 --> 54:51.167
Their language is Song.

54:51.333 --> 54:53.167
Most of them won't understand you
unless you sing. Come on.

54:54.083 --> 54:57.333
Going to the banquet
Prince Yan's at the banquet

54:57.500 --> 54:59.000
Going to the banquet
Prince Yan's at the banquet

54:59.167 --> 55:01.208
Hi. Oh, hi, hello.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.125
Going to the banquet
Going to the banquet

55:04.708 --> 55:07.625
Where's the prince? Where's the prince?
Hey, hey, hey

55:07.792 --> 55:10.833
Going, going, going, going
Going to the banquet

55:11.000 --> 55:14.250
Going, going, going, going
Going to the banquet

55:17.167 --> 55:18.333
Why aren't you guys dancing?

55:18.500 --> 55:19.542
I am dancing.

55:20.500 --> 55:21.750
Dancing is life

55:21.917 --> 55:23.417
Oh, we're almost there.

55:25.333 --> 55:28.417
How angelic.
Hi... Okay. All right.

55:29.083 --> 55:30.083
Wow.

55:33.125 --> 55:35.333
Oh, my gosh,
give me some of what they're having.

55:36.458 --> 55:38.250
-If you tell anyone about...
-What?

55:38.417 --> 55:40.417
That you're a pretty, pretty princess?

55:41.250 --> 55:44.667
So, that's what you meant
when you said "legal issue."

55:44.833 --> 55:47.875
It is a marriage of convenience.
It's more of a diplomatic act, you know?

55:48.042 --> 55:50.333
It's like, there was a power struggle.
Matriarchal society.

55:50.875 --> 55:53.792
We are friends. It's a long story.

55:54.167 --> 55:55.625
Maybe you could sing it.

55:56.208 --> 55:57.667
Maybe not.

55:58.125 --> 55:58.958
We're here.

56:05.167 --> 56:06.708
Damn.

56:06.875 --> 56:08.917
-You saw them arrive
-Oh, hello

56:09.917 --> 56:12.375
Well, okay, I see why you like
to come here.

56:15.583 --> 56:20.708
-Attention
-Yes

56:20.917 --> 56:25.917
A pleasure to announce
To this lovely roomful

56:26.208 --> 56:28.417
Two new faces

56:30.625 --> 56:33.542
One could be more cheerful

56:33.708 --> 56:35.958
Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha

56:36.125 --> 56:39.167
But nonetheless, we ring the bells

56:39.333 --> 56:43.417
To usher in, who, pray tell?

56:43.917 --> 56:44.917
None other than

56:45.333 --> 56:48.667
One, two, three

56:49.417 --> 56:54.833
The Marvels!

56:54.917 --> 56:56.000
The Marvels

56:56.083 --> 56:56.917
The Marvels?

56:57.083 --> 56:57.958
Yes!

56:58.458 --> 56:59.958
How is that even a thing already?

57:00.125 --> 57:02.875
-Okay, let's be cool.
-Where's the prince?

57:15.083 --> 57:16.083
That's...

57:17.125 --> 57:18.125
What the hell?

57:23.458 --> 57:25.833
-What is she doing?
-She's respecting the flow.

57:33.208 --> 57:36.042
How long

57:36.750 --> 57:39.292
do I have with my dance partner this time?

57:39.458 --> 57:41.417
Yan...
we are all in danger

57:41.625 --> 57:42.917
What is happening?

57:43.083 --> 57:43.917
What?

57:44.083 --> 57:46.625
-The Captain needs our help
-Help!

57:46.792 --> 57:48.208
Dar-Benn is coming

57:48.292 --> 57:49.750
I'm feeling so many feelings right now.

57:50.667 --> 57:52.500
Oh, Aladna's not afraid of her

57:52.667 --> 57:55.542
Invite her down
put her feet on the ground

57:55.708 --> 57:56.958
Give me a chance here...

57:57.125 --> 58:01.542
-before it gets too messy
-So lead the wolf inside our walls

58:01.708 --> 58:03.625
And trust that you alone...

58:03.792 --> 58:06.292
-can stop an army?
-Have I ever let you down?

58:06.458 --> 58:08.375
How many chapters of your Captain Marvel
fan fiction is this giving you?

58:08.458 --> 58:09.917
I'm not about to start...

58:10.042 --> 58:10.875
So many.

58:10.958 --> 58:11.875
and don't forget...

58:12.042 --> 58:13.792
Don't forget

58:15.417 --> 58:18.625
I'm not alone

58:22.167 --> 58:23.208
Monica.

58:27.292 --> 58:32.000
My Princess from the star...

58:32.167 --> 58:35.083
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Stop. Please stop.
We need to talk.

58:35.250 --> 58:36.542
-Okay, let's talk.
-Okay.

58:36.708 --> 58:38.583
Oh, wait. He doesn't have to sing?

58:38.750 --> 58:39.750
Yeah, he's bilingual.

58:40.292 --> 58:41.625
We are severely underdressed.

58:41.792 --> 58:44.625
But could you get us
something a little more battle-ready?

58:44.792 --> 58:46.042
Of course.

58:46.458 --> 58:47.458
Thank you.

58:51.375 --> 58:52.750
Theories so far?

58:52.917 --> 58:54.833
At best, a one-off pest problem.

58:56.125 --> 58:58.625
At worst, an enemy plant.

58:58.792 --> 59:00.958
Some kinda infestation bioweapon.

59:01.125 --> 59:03.458
Or it could be from a traitor from within.

59:03.625 --> 59:08.250
Well, let's not go there yet.
This... egg you say...

59:08.417 --> 59:11.833
let's just continue to study it,
and if anything...

59:12.000 --> 59:15.250
Warning. Twenty-nine new objects detected.

59:18.625 --> 59:19.625
Oh, my God.

59:22.583 --> 59:24.542
What about Lady of Light?

59:25.125 --> 59:26.792
-Frequency. Pulsar.
-No. No.

59:26.958 --> 59:28.208
Pulsar Light Lady.

59:28.375 --> 59:30.667
Absolutely not. These...
These are too much, right?

59:30.833 --> 59:31.667
-Definitely.
-No.

59:42.083 --> 59:44.083
We make this quick. Nothing grandiose.

59:44.250 --> 59:46.792
You three need to disappear. But stay close.

59:46.958 --> 59:47.958
My specialty.

59:55.125 --> 59:56.125
This will work, Yan.

59:58.375 --> 01:00:00.958
Remember, we wanna keep
unintentional switching to a minimum.

01:00:01.125 --> 01:00:03.792
Entertain her as long as you possibly can.

01:00:03.958 --> 01:00:05.542
Monica and I will get the jump on her.

01:00:05.708 --> 01:00:06.625
And we'll get the bangle.

01:00:10.333 --> 01:00:11.458
It's time.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.042
Supremor, why have you come?

01:01:16.208 --> 01:01:20.792
I've come here to pardon you
for your crimes against the Kree Empire.

01:01:21.625 --> 01:01:22.625
Kneel.

01:01:23.042 --> 01:01:24.042
To you?

01:01:26.250 --> 01:01:28.500
-I will never kneel.
-Okay.

01:01:56.917 --> 01:01:57.917
Damn it!

01:02:21.542 --> 01:02:22.542
Use your scarf.

01:02:40.875 --> 01:02:41.875
Go!

01:02:50.958 --> 01:02:52.125
I found her.

01:03:08.833 --> 01:03:09.833
Monica, where are you?

01:03:16.792 --> 01:03:17.750
Monica, tag me in.

01:03:17.917 --> 01:03:19.333
One, two...

01:03:20.375 --> 01:03:21.292
Don't do this.

01:03:21.542 --> 01:03:22.750
You're too late.

01:04:01.792 --> 01:04:03.083
Where did you get that?

01:04:03.667 --> 01:04:06.125
My grandma, she sent it to me in the mail.

01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:09.792
-Give it to me.
-Kamala, run.

01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:11.500
Get to the ship.

01:04:25.750 --> 01:04:28.375
With this, your powers
only make me stronger.

01:04:52.333 --> 01:04:53.750
The surges are frying our systems.

01:04:53.917 --> 01:04:55.042
Are we doing something about these?

01:04:55.208 --> 01:04:56.333
The space elevator's offline.

01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:57.792
You ever come in here with good news?

01:04:59.292 --> 01:05:00.958
Half the evacuation pods just went down.

01:05:01.125 --> 01:05:03.125
That's not good news.

01:05:36.875 --> 01:05:37.917
Are you guys in?

01:05:38.083 --> 01:05:39.083
In.

01:05:40.875 --> 01:05:42.542
Redirect all fighters.

01:05:53.917 --> 01:05:55.292
Disengaging autopilot.

01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:04.000
Oh, my God.
Okay, here we go. Here we go.

01:06:07.667 --> 01:06:08.583
Monica?

01:06:10.833 --> 01:06:12.375
Monica, we're going down, Monica!

01:06:16.042 --> 01:06:17.333
I thought you could drive this thing!

01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:18.625
Carol! Get down here.

01:06:19.042 --> 01:06:20.042
Hold that thought.

01:06:20.208 --> 01:06:21.208
Can you believe this woman?

01:06:27.833 --> 01:06:29.917
O, Captain! My Captain!

01:06:38.583 --> 01:06:40.875
-No, no, no!
-Move over.

01:06:50.083 --> 01:06:51.625
I'm activating a jump point.

01:06:51.792 --> 01:06:54.125
-No, I can lose her.
-And what about the other 20 ships?

01:06:54.292 --> 01:06:55.292
I can do this.

01:07:01.292 --> 01:07:02.708
-Missile lock.
-Guys?

01:07:02.875 --> 01:07:04.208
Missile lock.

01:07:14.083 --> 01:07:15.667
Incoming missiles.

01:07:15.833 --> 01:07:17.417
-Impact in five...
-We need to leave now.

01:07:17.583 --> 01:07:18.625
-I can't let this happen again.
-four...

01:07:18.750 --> 01:07:19.583
-It already has.
-three, two...

01:07:19.708 --> 01:07:22.000
-I can do this.
-And you'll kill us trying.

01:07:22.167 --> 01:07:24.333
Jump point activated.

01:07:43.833 --> 01:07:45.708
We left Aladna to fend for themselves.

01:07:45.875 --> 01:07:47.250
Dar-Benn was gonna get my bangle.

01:07:47.417 --> 01:07:49.625
So I made a tough call
like you did on Tarnax.

01:07:49.792 --> 01:07:52.667
Don't try to be like me.
I messed this whole thing up.

01:07:52.833 --> 01:07:54.042
If we weren't entangled...

01:07:54.208 --> 01:07:55.875
if we weren't here,
then you could have beat Dar-Benn.

01:07:56.042 --> 01:07:57.083
And I'm sorry.

01:07:59.375 --> 01:08:01.708
No, you don't understand.

01:08:01.875 --> 01:08:05.292
The Kree had been ruled by an AI
for a millennia...

01:08:05.458 --> 01:08:06.875
that led them into a war.

01:08:07.042 --> 01:08:10.292
And I thought the only way to stop it
was to destroy it.

01:08:11.333 --> 01:08:12.375
But I just...

01:08:13.250 --> 01:08:14.583
made it worse.

01:08:16.125 --> 01:08:18.625
I'm the reason why the civil war
started in the first place...

01:08:18.792 --> 01:08:21.625
I'm the reason why they
couldn't breathe the air.

01:08:22.250 --> 01:08:24.207
That's how I got the name Annihilator.

01:08:25.957 --> 01:08:28.917
And I never wanted you to see
that version of me.

01:08:32.542 --> 01:08:34.375
Is that why you never came back?

01:08:34.875 --> 01:08:36.542
I thought if I fixed it...

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.457
then I could come home.

01:08:39.542 --> 01:08:40.625
Carol.

01:08:42.625 --> 01:08:44.625
That's not how family works.

01:08:46.292 --> 01:08:50.000
I never expected you to be
the mighty Captain Marvel.

01:08:51.875 --> 01:08:53.292
I just wanted you.

01:08:54.957 --> 01:08:56.542
My aunt.

01:09:02.207 --> 01:09:03.957
I'm really glad that you're here now.

01:09:10.917 --> 01:09:12.542
And you, too.

01:09:13.332 --> 01:09:14.792
I'm glad to be here.

01:09:15.957 --> 01:09:19.457
I hope that goes without saying.
And I am sorry...

01:09:19.625 --> 01:09:21.875
for coming on too strong at the beginning.

01:09:22.042 --> 01:09:23.875
I did not give you a lot of space
to be a real person.

01:09:29.292 --> 01:09:30.457
We have to find her.

01:09:30.625 --> 01:09:32.167
I mean, but she could be anywhere.

01:09:32.332 --> 01:09:35.000
No, not anywhere.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.832
She's targeting the people
that I care about...

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.582
and stealing resources
from every place I call home.

01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:43.457
We have to warn Fury.

01:09:49.832 --> 01:09:51.457
This is an emergency.

01:09:51.625 --> 01:09:56.458
All S.A.B.E.R. personnel must report
to an evacuation pod immediately. Walk.

01:09:56.625 --> 01:09:58.625
-Do not run.
-We only have one evacuation bay online.

01:09:58.792 --> 01:09:59.875
Which means that all we have left...

01:10:00.042 --> 01:10:02.417
to evacuate 350 personnel
are 15 escape pods...

01:10:02.583 --> 01:10:04.750
which seat five, 10, if we squeeze.
It's nowhere near enough.

01:10:04.917 --> 01:10:07.375
Well, fill the remaining ones
with as many people as you can...

01:10:07.542 --> 01:10:11.000
-then come up with a Plan B.
-This is an emergency. All S.A.B.E.R...

01:10:20.583 --> 01:10:22.333
No, no, no.

01:10:23.125 --> 01:10:24.042
Aamir. Go help them.

01:10:24.208 --> 01:10:25.042
Okay, okay. Okay.

01:10:27.625 --> 01:10:28.750
I got this.

01:10:33.833 --> 01:10:34.833
My living room.

01:10:35.833 --> 01:10:36.833
Goose?

01:10:48.333 --> 01:10:50.708
Goose, how'd you...

01:10:51.458 --> 01:10:54.125
Come here. Come. Come on.

01:10:54.292 --> 01:10:57.125
Yes. Yes. Come here. Look at you.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.125
Look!

01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:01.417
Oh, no, not my good eye!

01:11:03.625 --> 01:11:05.333
We only have one escape pod left.

01:11:05.917 --> 01:11:06.917
We're doomed.

01:11:08.375 --> 01:11:09.667
In the end...

01:11:10.042 --> 01:11:12.833
none of us choose how we transition
from this life...

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.417
to the next.

01:11:14.750 --> 01:11:16.458
What? No!

01:11:16.625 --> 01:11:18.583
Get everyone to the evacuation deck.

01:11:18.750 --> 01:11:19.750
Now!

01:11:26.417 --> 01:11:28.042
Here, kitty. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

01:11:28.125 --> 01:11:30.000
What are we doing?

01:11:30.958 --> 01:11:32.083
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

01:11:32.167 --> 01:11:33.708
Let's go. Come on. Come on.

01:11:34.208 --> 01:11:36.292
-I can't. Can you?
-I got it.

01:11:39.250 --> 01:11:41.000
What is going on, fam?

01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:42.500
Kamala?

01:11:43.083 --> 01:11:44.708
Kamala! Yusuf, Kamala!

01:11:44.875 --> 01:11:47.500
Kamala! Kamala!

01:11:49.208 --> 01:11:50.542
You're back safely, beta.

01:11:50.708 --> 01:11:51.875
You're not dead.

01:11:52.125 --> 01:11:53.875
I've lost contact with Earth.

01:11:54.042 --> 01:11:56.208
We're officially at abandon-ship phase.

01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:01.750
Spit him out.

01:12:01.917 --> 01:12:03.250
-Spit him out.
-No, no, no.

01:12:03.417 --> 01:12:04.833
No. That's the plan.

01:12:06.125 --> 01:12:07.417
-That's the plan?
-It's much easier...

01:12:07.583 --> 01:12:11.042
to transport a family of cats
than hundreds of crew members.

01:12:11.667 --> 01:12:12.958
So, we're literally herding cats?

01:12:17.708 --> 01:12:18.708
Come here, kitty.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.708
Attention, S.A.B.E.R. crew.

01:12:21.875 --> 01:12:24.792
Stop running and let the Flerkens eat you.

01:12:24.958 --> 01:12:26.375
You will be fine.

01:12:37.208 --> 01:12:38.583
S.A.B.E.R. crew.

01:12:38.750 --> 01:12:41.833
Stop running and let the Flerkens eat you.

01:12:42.875 --> 01:12:44.292
Stop running.

01:12:58.833 --> 01:13:00.083
I'm sorry.

01:13:05.208 --> 01:13:07.958
Stop running and let the Flerkens eat you.

01:13:09.292 --> 01:13:10.375
Stop running.

01:13:31.042 --> 01:13:32.375
Guys, I found her.

01:13:33.875 --> 01:13:36.000
-Come on. Come on, move.
-Hey! Come on.

01:13:36.167 --> 01:13:37.167
Come on, come here.

01:13:38.958 --> 01:13:41.083
-Go, go, go.
-Come on, come on.

01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:43.417
-Go to the spacecraft bay.
-Okay. Come on.

01:13:43.583 --> 01:13:45.583
Come on.
Yusuf, stop with your belt.

01:13:59.833 --> 01:14:02.583
Nope. No. No, no, no. Thank you. No.

01:14:03.583 --> 01:14:04.833
Come, come, come.

01:14:12.708 --> 01:14:16.250
Don't you worry, little one.
Here, go to Kamala. Go to Kamala.

01:14:19.375 --> 01:14:21.542
-There you go, come, come.
-I found Dar-Benn.

01:14:21.708 --> 01:14:22.667
What?

01:14:23.583 --> 01:14:24.833
She wants our sun.

01:14:52.542 --> 01:14:53.667
You leavin' again?

01:14:54.333 --> 01:14:55.417
Yeah.

01:14:55.958 --> 01:14:57.500
Ammi, the universe isn't safe.

01:14:57.667 --> 01:14:59.667
And if the universe isn't safe,
that means you guys aren't safe.

01:14:59.833 --> 01:15:01.000
And if you guys aren't...

01:15:01.625 --> 01:15:02.958
Listen to me.

01:15:03.667 --> 01:15:07.333
You are chosen for a greater purpose, okay?

01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:09.375
So, of course you must go now.

01:15:10.667 --> 01:15:13.417
But I will never let you go.

01:15:13.875 --> 01:15:15.667
You understand that, right?

01:15:20.292 --> 01:15:22.125
-Yeah.
-Come back safely, beta.

01:15:22.292 --> 01:15:25.083
You better.
I don't wanna be an only child.

01:15:25.250 --> 01:15:27.458
Not again. Not with these two.

01:15:30.917 --> 01:15:33.667
You think it's wise taking that bangle
to the bad guy?

01:15:34.042 --> 01:15:36.375
Yes. Mr. Fury's right. Give it to me.
I will take it home.

01:15:37.292 --> 01:15:38.500
Dar-Benn's opened another jump point...

01:15:38.667 --> 01:15:40.708
and we're gonna need both bangles
to close it.

01:15:40.875 --> 01:15:43.833
Then I guess you'd better make damn sure
she doesn't get her hands on it.

01:15:44.833 --> 01:15:45.958
Understood.

01:16:04.375 --> 01:16:05.500
Oh, God, Mr. Fury...

01:16:05.667 --> 01:16:08.792
-you are going in the wrong direction!
-Mrs. Khan, I know!

01:16:12.208 --> 01:16:14.958
-You did it, Mr. Fury!
-I didn't do anything.

01:16:18.667 --> 01:16:19.792
Are you praying?

01:16:20.750 --> 01:16:23.208
Don't stop! We need all the help we can get!

01:16:24.208 --> 01:16:25.125
Amen!

01:16:26.250 --> 01:16:27.500
Amen!

01:16:27.667 --> 01:16:28.833
Holy cow!

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.167
Mr. Fury!

01:17:23.792 --> 01:17:24.917
There she is...

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.625
the Annihilator herself.

01:17:27.792 --> 01:17:29.250
It's over, Dar-Benn.

01:17:29.625 --> 01:17:30.792
No, not yet.

01:17:30.958 --> 01:17:33.500
I know that you would do anything
to protect Hala.

01:17:34.167 --> 01:17:37.500
This will be the end of the Kree.
It will be the end of everything.

01:17:37.667 --> 01:17:40.833
You took from me.
I'm simply repaying the favor.

01:17:41.833 --> 01:17:44.708
Now, give me the band.

01:17:46.125 --> 01:17:47.250
You're forgetting something.

01:17:47.417 --> 01:17:49.250
-What?
-Me.

01:18:03.625 --> 01:18:06.958
This could have been so much easier.

01:18:07.250 --> 01:18:09.875
I don't know. I like our odds.

01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:32.708
You're living up to your name again.

01:19:33.917 --> 01:19:35.292
I didn't want this.

01:19:35.458 --> 01:19:37.208
Death seems to follow you.

01:19:44.375 --> 01:19:46.042
It doesn't have to end like this, Dar-Benn.

01:19:46.208 --> 01:19:47.375
Please, just give us the bangle.

01:19:47.542 --> 01:19:48.458
I won't!

01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:52.833
Hala's sun died because of you.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.583
Why shouldn't you repay us?

01:19:56.750 --> 01:19:57.792
Maybe she should.

01:19:59.667 --> 01:20:02.292
The reaction in your sun's core has slowed.

01:20:02.458 --> 01:20:04.750
It needs an incredible amount of energy
to jump-start it...

01:20:04.917 --> 01:20:06.625
and that's what you have, Carol.

01:20:07.625 --> 01:20:10.542
You can use your powers to save Hala.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:13.958
But I've never done anything
like that before.

01:20:14.125 --> 01:20:17.125
In the last couple of days I have done
a lot of things I have never done before.

01:20:18.833 --> 01:20:20.042
You got this.

01:20:25.750 --> 01:20:26.917
For Hala.

01:20:31.708 --> 01:20:33.083
For Hala.

01:20:50.625 --> 01:20:52.958
Try anything
and I'll kill her faster than you can move.

01:20:57.375 --> 01:20:58.917
Carol!

01:21:02.958 --> 01:21:03.958
No!

01:21:19.125 --> 01:21:20.417
You won't survive this.

01:21:20.583 --> 01:21:23.042
Dar-Benn, listen to me.

01:22:07.125 --> 01:22:08.250
Are you okay?

01:22:09.583 --> 01:22:10.583
Yeah.

01:22:12.042 --> 01:22:13.500
I didn't switch.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.000
One, two, three.

01:22:40.708 --> 01:22:42.667
I'm so glad you're okay.

01:22:43.583 --> 01:22:44.750
You got the bangles.

01:22:47.125 --> 01:22:48.458
We are gonna need those.

01:22:51.458 --> 01:22:53.667
Okay, come on, Princess.

01:22:59.250 --> 01:23:01.083
So, what are we looking at?

01:23:01.250 --> 01:23:04.042
A self-propagating singularity
with negative mass...

01:23:04.208 --> 01:23:05.750
and non-Newtonian topology.

01:23:07.625 --> 01:23:10.667
She tore a hole in space-time.

01:23:13.208 --> 01:23:16.625
That is a different reality
bleeding into ours.

01:23:17.083 --> 01:23:18.250
Can we even fix that?

01:23:18.417 --> 01:23:21.708
In theory, you and Carol can reproduce
the same amount of energy...

01:23:21.875 --> 01:23:23.292
that was used to open it.

01:23:23.458 --> 01:23:26.250
I will absorb it and then release it,
but from inside the tear.

01:23:26.417 --> 01:23:27.958
But what about the switching?

01:23:28.125 --> 01:23:30.625
Our powers aren't entangled anymore.

01:23:34.083 --> 01:23:36.500
Well, that's a good thing, I guess.

01:23:36.958 --> 01:23:40.958
But, wait. You want us to blast you
with the same amount of power...

01:23:41.125 --> 01:23:43.625
that punched a hole in the fabric
of space-time?

01:23:44.583 --> 01:23:47.333
If we wanna un-punch it, yeah.

01:23:48.083 --> 01:23:49.083
Monica...

01:23:50.750 --> 01:23:51.958
You're gonna need this.

01:24:00.417 --> 01:24:01.667
How are you feeling, Ms. Marvel?

01:24:03.167 --> 01:24:05.750
These bangles traveled
through space and time.

01:24:05.917 --> 01:24:07.167
To find me.

01:24:09.375 --> 01:24:10.625
I was born for this.

01:24:14.833 --> 01:24:16.417
It has to be now.

01:24:58.708 --> 01:25:00.125
Your mom would be proud.

01:25:01.167 --> 01:25:02.792
Higher, further, faster.

01:25:05.042 --> 01:25:07.042
Higher, further, faster.

01:26:04.625 --> 01:26:06.625
It's closing, Monica.
You've got to get out of there.

01:26:08.167 --> 01:26:09.458
I can't leave, Carol.

01:26:09.625 --> 01:26:10.917
What? What do you mean?

01:26:11.083 --> 01:26:12.167
I can't leave.

01:26:12.333 --> 01:26:13.542
I have to finish the job.

01:26:13.708 --> 01:26:15.583
No! Monica, it's closing.
You'll be trapped!

01:26:16.208 --> 01:26:17.208
It's okay.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.125
Come on.

01:26:40.042 --> 01:26:42.042
Always knew I would have to stay.

01:27:49.958 --> 01:27:51.292
Kamala.

01:27:57.375 --> 01:27:59.500
Kamala, you saved
the world.

01:28:04.417 --> 01:28:07.458
Why are you crying?
Why are you crying?

01:28:11.958 --> 01:28:13.250
What happened?

01:28:14.458 --> 01:28:16.250
We lost Monica.

01:28:19.250 --> 01:28:21.500
She got stuck on the other side.

01:28:22.250 --> 01:28:23.417
And Carol?

01:28:26.958 --> 01:28:28.708
She went to fulfill a promise.

01:29:53.375 --> 01:29:54.583
How are things?

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.875
The planets are expected
to make a full recovery.

01:29:58.042 --> 01:30:00.750
And a team of scientists are being sent
to Hala to try and help their people.

01:30:00.917 --> 01:30:02.458
That's not what I meant.

01:30:25.833 --> 01:30:29.083
This says "Kitchen," but there are
all these hot sauce packets...

01:30:29.250 --> 01:30:32.375
And then there's
this very bizarre-looking tray...

01:30:32.542 --> 01:30:35.458
which I will say is
a very good quality, though.

01:30:35.625 --> 01:30:36.625
You can keep it.

01:30:36.792 --> 01:30:38.000
-Oh, no, no, Carol, I just...
-Where else would they go?

01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:40.500
Oh, yeah, yeah, it was for me.

01:30:40.667 --> 01:30:44.750
The vastness of it just gives you
a whole new perspective on life.

01:30:44.917 --> 01:30:46.833
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.375
And it was surprisingly cool.

01:30:52.625 --> 01:30:54.167
This place is amazing.

01:30:54.333 --> 01:30:55.917
Yeah, it is.

01:30:57.542 --> 01:30:58.792
Hey, do you still fly that thing?

01:30:59.625 --> 01:31:00.792
-You wanna check it out?
-I do.

01:31:00.958 --> 01:31:01.917
All right.

01:31:02.083 --> 01:31:05.292
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
Come here. Come here. Come here.

01:31:06.167 --> 01:31:09.625
-I'm so happy that you're home safe, beta.
-Okay.

01:31:15.500 --> 01:31:16.500
Aamir...

01:31:17.500 --> 01:31:20.292
this would be a lovely house
to raise a family in, you know?

01:31:21.958 --> 01:31:22.958
Aamir.

01:31:23.250 --> 01:31:24.875
This is so cool.

01:31:25.375 --> 01:31:26.792
Pilot seat's all you.

01:31:36.375 --> 01:31:37.708
Let's fly this thing.

01:31:38.208 --> 01:31:40.167
I actually don't have the key.

01:31:40.333 --> 01:31:42.333
I'm just looking after it.

01:31:44.083 --> 01:31:46.000
Just until Monica gets back?

01:31:46.625 --> 01:31:47.792
Yeah.

01:31:49.250 --> 01:31:51.250
Just until Monica gets back.

01:31:51.917 --> 01:31:53.333
I really miss her.

01:31:53.958 --> 01:31:56.042
We were good together.

01:31:56.208 --> 01:31:58.542
Which got me thinking...

01:32:10.208 --> 01:32:12.000
Pizza delivery.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:17.833
Okay.

01:32:23.917 --> 01:32:25.458
Can I help you?

01:32:25.625 --> 01:32:27.000
Kate Bishop.

01:32:30.333 --> 01:32:32.375
Did you think you're
the only kid superhero in the world?

01:32:34.167 --> 01:32:35.625
-Well, I'm 23.
-Oh, I know.

01:32:36.792 --> 01:32:37.917
I've been reading up on you.

01:32:39.042 --> 01:32:40.042
Where did you get that?

01:32:40.208 --> 01:32:41.583
I found it in my couch.

01:32:41.958 --> 01:32:42.875
Okay.

01:32:43.042 --> 01:32:45.125
You've just become
part of a much larger universe.

01:32:46.583 --> 01:32:50.292
Which, at the moment, is just me, mostly.

01:32:50.458 --> 01:32:51.458
I do have feelers out, though.

01:32:51.625 --> 01:32:53.458
-Did you know Ant-Man had a daughter?
-What do you want?

01:32:53.625 --> 01:32:55.250
I'm putting together a team.

01:32:55.917 --> 01:32:57.250
And I want you on it.

01:33:03.208 --> 01:33:04.208
Please?

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:12.167
Mom?

01:36:15.417 --> 01:36:16.750
"Mom"?

01:36:18.417 --> 01:36:20.250
-Mom!
-"Mom?"

01:36:20.417 --> 01:36:22.375
I've missed you so much!

01:36:22.542 --> 01:36:23.583
You missed me?

01:36:23.750 --> 01:36:26.292
-I'm so sorry. I'm... I'm...
-Okay. Okay. Okay, okay.

01:36:26.458 --> 01:36:29.792
Hey, hey, look at me.
It's okay. You're okay. Hey.

01:36:30.917 --> 01:36:33.042
How's our mysterious visitor?

01:36:33.208 --> 01:36:35.375
She seems a little disoriented.

01:36:35.542 --> 01:36:38.208
Where... Where are we? What happened?

01:36:38.375 --> 01:36:40.458
We were hoping you could tell us.

01:36:41.375 --> 01:36:43.708
All we know is that Binary found you.

01:36:43.875 --> 01:36:48.125
My theory? You somehow crossed
through a tear in space-time.

01:36:48.292 --> 01:36:51.000
You are now in a reality parallel
to your own.

01:36:51.750 --> 01:36:54.625
Which is, of course, impossible.

01:36:57.167 --> 01:36:59.625
I think there might be
a little confusion happening.

01:36:59.792 --> 01:37:02.958
Confusion is but the first step
on the journey to knowledge.

01:37:03.125 --> 01:37:05.750
Okay. I'll take it from here.

01:37:05.917 --> 01:37:08.083
Charles asked for an update.

01:37:09.542 --> 01:37:11.250
I'll come by and check on you later.

01:37:22.500 --> 01:37:23.792
Who are you?

01:37:25.167 --> 01:37:27.125
Oh, shit.
