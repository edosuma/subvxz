<i>Amy: Previously on "Heartland":</i>

00:01.769 --> 00:03.268
- Well, good for Ezra.

00:03.371 --> 00:05.437
- Do I detect a bit of
jealousy, Mr. Fleming?

00:05.539 --> 00:07.339
- Kinda goin' out of his way
to help ya.

00:07.441 --> 00:09.008
- You have nothing
to worry about.

00:09.110 --> 00:11.010
We dated for a while.
- And you dated.

00:11.112 --> 00:12.878
<i> Amy: What's his name?</i>
<i> Lily: Howler.</i>

00:12.980 --> 00:14.880
- I'm not taking this, Lily.
If you think that money

00:14.982 --> 00:16.648
can make up for everything
that's happened

00:16.751 --> 00:18.817
in the last year,
then you are out of your mind.

00:18.919 --> 00:21.453
<i> Auction Lead: Up next,</i>
<i> we have Platinum Bow.</i>

00:21.555 --> 00:23.355
<i> Auctioneer: $800,000,</i>
<i> Now eight and a half.</i>

00:23.457 --> 00:25.557
Sold! $800,000.
(Clapping)

00:25.659 --> 00:27.426
<i> Katie: Even though</i>
<i> we don't live together,</i>

00:27.528 --> 00:29.461
you're both always there
when I need you.

00:29.563 --> 00:31.463
I love my life
just the way it is.

00:31.565 --> 00:33.665
I... I wouldn't want anything
to change.

00:33.768 --> 00:35.034
Lyndy: That's you, Mom.

00:35.136 --> 00:36.668
- Aw, is this the man
in the moon?

00:36.771 --> 00:38.137
- No, that's Dada.

00:38.239 --> 00:40.606
That's where he said he'll be.

(Horse nickers contentedly)

01:05.299 --> 01:08.867
¶¶¶

01:08.969 --> 01:12.471
- I thought I might find
you here.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.640
Nothing like a ride
to clear your head.

01:14.742 --> 01:17.976
(Horse nickers,
echoing whinny)

01:18.079 --> 01:20.979

¶¶¶

01:33.928 --> 01:36.662
'Kay, spill.

01:36.764 --> 01:39.098
Have you talked to Peter yet?
Is that why you're so stressed?

01:39.200 --> 01:40.999
- No, I haven't,

01:41.102 --> 01:43.869
and I know I can't let this
go on any longer.

01:43.971 --> 01:47.005
I have to let him know what I
wanna do, one way or the other.

01:47.108 --> 01:48.173
- But...?

01:48.275 --> 01:50.242
- But I'm torn.

01:50.344 --> 01:51.844
I mean, that camping trip
with Katie,

01:51.946 --> 01:54.880
she made it perfectly clear
that she's fine.

01:54.982 --> 01:57.015
Better than fine. I mean,
she's certainly not hoping

01:57.118 --> 01:59.017
Peter and I will get back
together, so...

01:59.120 --> 02:00.786
(Sighs heavily)

02:00.888 --> 02:04.456
If she's fine, then maybe
I shouldn't rock the boat.

02:04.558 --> 02:07.659
- Well, that's great, Lou,
but are you fine?

02:07.761 --> 02:10.929
- Ha. No, clearly, I'm not.

02:14.034 --> 02:16.602
- I know this isn't
a fair question,

02:16.704 --> 02:19.705
but how would you feel
if you lost Peter?

02:20.808 --> 02:22.274
(Horse nickers)

02:22.376 --> 02:26.211
(Birds chirp,
leaves rustle in the wind)

02:27.882 --> 02:30.048
- Oh shoot, Amy,
I gotta get to work.

02:30.151 --> 02:31.250
(Hand pats gently)
Come on.

02:31.352 --> 02:33.252
(Horse snorts gently)

02:35.256 --> 02:37.623
(Shadow nickers,
grass rustles)

02:38.893 --> 02:40.792
(Buddy grunts gently)

02:41.896 --> 02:43.795
(Truck rumbles)

02:43.898 --> 02:45.397
<i> Tim: Jack! Look who's back!</i>

02:45.499 --> 02:47.566
(Buddy snorts)
- Welcome home, Jessica!

02:47.668 --> 02:49.701
(Truck rumbles away)

02:49.803 --> 02:51.170
(Buddy grunts)

02:53.607 --> 02:55.040
(Mailbox creaks shut)

02:55.142 --> 02:56.508
(Buddy snorts gently,
Jack chuckles)

02:56.610 --> 02:59.077
No, do what you need to do,
Lise.

02:59.180 --> 03:02.614
I understand.
We'll see ya when we see ya.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.716
Yeah, I love you, too.

03:04.818 --> 03:07.920
- Hey, thanks for the talk.
It helped.

03:08.022 --> 03:09.788
Bye, Grandpa!

03:09.890 --> 03:12.824
- Okay, so however it was
that you helped her,

03:12.927 --> 03:14.593
maybe you can do the same
with Lisa,

03:14.695 --> 03:17.863
because this race that
she's entered Platinum Bow in,

03:17.965 --> 03:19.765
it's got her all wound up.

03:19.867 --> 03:22.801
- When does she leave?
- In a few days.

03:22.903 --> 03:24.336
This is for you.

03:25.839 --> 03:28.740
- It's from Lily.
- Well.

03:31.111 --> 03:33.078
(Screen door snicks open)

03:34.215 --> 03:36.081
(Door creaks shut,
footsteps thud lightly)

03:36.183 --> 03:39.985

letter rustles)

03:52.132 --> 03:54.032

03:54.134 --> 03:55.434
(Intense music plays)

03:56.770 --> 04:05.677
¶¶¶

04:05.779 --> 04:11.984
¶¶¶

04:12.086 --> 04:14.486
¶ And at the break of day ¶

04:14.588 --> 04:19.157
¶ You sank into your dream ¶

04:19.260 --> 04:20.559
¶ You dreamer ¶

04:20.661 --> 04:23.161
¶ Oh, oh, oh, oh... ¶

04:23.264 --> 04:25.030
¶ You dreamer ¶

04:27.468 --> 04:31.370
¶ You dreamer ¶

04:32.573 --> 04:35.474
¶¶¶

04:37.044 --> 04:39.011
- So, Lily and Wade separated.

04:39.113 --> 04:40.712
- Yeah, and as part
of their agreement,

04:40.814 --> 04:43.515
Lily got to keep Howler,
and his winnings,

04:43.617 --> 04:45.884
and he's continued to win.

04:45.986 --> 04:47.419
Look at this.

04:49.657 --> 04:52.824
- (Whistles)
That is a lot of money.

04:52.926 --> 04:54.860
- I know.
And I didn't tell you this,

04:54.962 --> 04:57.029
but last year,
when Lily was here,

04:57.131 --> 04:59.197
she tried to pay me
part of Howler's purse,

04:59.300 --> 05:01.600
but I refused.
- Oh?

05:01.702 --> 05:03.935
- Because I told her that
he was not ready to race

05:04.038 --> 05:05.971
and Wade convinced her
to enter him anyway,

05:06.073 --> 05:07.406
and I was, I was mad at them!

05:07.508 --> 05:09.975
- And now she wants you
to accept this

05:10.077 --> 05:11.643
because she figures
you're the reason

05:11.745 --> 05:13.178
Howler's doing so well.
- Yes,

05:13.280 --> 05:15.047
but it is too much money,
Grandpa.

05:15.149 --> 05:16.615
- It's a lot.

05:16.717 --> 05:20.085
- I'm just afraid that I'll
feel like I owe her something.

05:20.187 --> 05:21.586
What should I do?

05:24.525 --> 05:26.191
Tim: I'm glad the condo sale
went well.

05:26.293 --> 05:28.393
- Yeah, it did.
It closed without a hitch.

05:28.495 --> 05:29.895
I put so much stuff in storage

05:29.997 --> 05:31.563
that I know I'm never
gonna use,

05:31.665 --> 05:33.565
but I just, I couldn't
part with it.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.334
- Well, it sounds like
you had fun.

05:35.436 --> 05:37.102
- I did.

05:37.204 --> 05:39.538
I went to galleries,
I caught up with friends,

05:39.640 --> 05:41.807
I walked a lot.
It was so hot.

05:41.909 --> 05:44.109
I forgot what Manhattan
was like in the summer.

05:45.979 --> 05:49.014
- And how's Ezra?
- (Chuckles)

05:49.116 --> 05:50.615
Ezra was great.

05:50.718 --> 05:52.451
I couldn't have done it
without him.

05:52.553 --> 05:55.120
I treated him to a ridiculously
expensive meal

05:55.222 --> 05:56.822
to say thank you.

05:56.924 --> 05:58.490
He thought all the lumberjack
photos were great,

05:58.592 --> 06:00.359
by the way. Everyone did.
- Mm.

06:00.461 --> 06:03.261
Glad I measured up.
- You did.

06:03.364 --> 06:05.931
It was, it was sad
to say goodbye,

06:06.033 --> 06:08.266
but I'm kinda ready
to close the door

06:08.369 --> 06:10.001
on that part of my life.

06:12.740 --> 06:14.139
- Well, I'm glad
to have you back.

06:14.241 --> 06:15.941
- Mm.
(Lips smack lightly)

06:19.246 --> 06:21.513
Um, I'm just, I'm gonna take
a shower and freshen up.

06:21.615 --> 06:23.148
- Yeah!

06:25.152 --> 06:26.918
(Birds chirp,
footsteps thud lightly)

06:27.020 --> 06:28.954
- Okay. (Sighs)

06:29.056 --> 06:30.856
Okay, you can do this.
You can just...

06:30.958 --> 06:32.157
(Phone keys tap,
Lou inhales sharply)

06:32.259 --> 06:34.393
(Exhales heavily,
phone thunks)

06:36.163 --> 06:37.996
Where did this come from?
(Approaching footsteps)

06:38.098 --> 06:39.831
<i> Rick: Oh, I bought it for you.</i>

06:39.933 --> 06:41.400
Meet Alexa.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.969
I figured you could use some...
relaxing music,

06:44.071 --> 06:46.004
from time to time,
of your choice,

06:46.106 --> 06:48.607
just to, you know,
take the edge off.

06:48.709 --> 06:51.309
Now, will you make the call?
- What call?

06:51.412 --> 06:53.145
- The one you've been trying
to make for the last week.

06:53.247 --> 06:55.013
Wait, sorry, the last month.

06:55.115 --> 06:56.415
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

06:56.517 --> 06:58.183
- Yeah, you do!
And to be honest,

06:58.285 --> 06:59.851
it's driving me a bit mad.

06:59.953 --> 07:01.520
Not to mention
your concentration level

07:01.622 --> 07:04.423
is on par with my golden
retriever.

07:04.525 --> 07:07.092
Oh, wait...
I'm insulting Penelope.

07:07.194 --> 07:09.027
- Thanks for that, Rick.

07:09.129 --> 07:10.529
- Will you just call Peter?
- You know what?

07:10.631 --> 07:12.964
I wish I had never told you
anything about my life.

07:13.066 --> 07:14.433
- Yeah, but you did,

07:14.535 --> 07:16.435
and now I've gotta live
with it.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.438
(Footsteps recede)

07:19.540 --> 07:21.072
(Phone key clicks,
Amy sighs)

07:21.175 --> 07:22.441
(Line rings)

07:25.179 --> 07:27.312
<i> Voicemail: Please leave</i>
<i> a message after the tone.</i>

07:27.414 --> 07:29.448
(Amy sighs, voicemail beeps)
- Mommy?!

07:30.551 --> 07:32.250
- Hi, Sweetheart!
- Hi.

07:32.352 --> 07:33.585
- Unnggghh!

07:33.687 --> 07:35.687
- How many days
until kindergarten?

07:35.789 --> 07:38.223
- Um, four more sleeps.
Are you excited?

07:38.325 --> 07:40.058
(Phone rings)
Just a minute.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.194
(Call beeps on)
Hello?

07:42.296 --> 07:44.262
Clint: Amy.
- Hi, Clint. Um...

07:44.364 --> 07:45.897
- Hey, did you get my message?
- Yeah.

07:45.999 --> 07:47.566
No, I can come over
to the Centre right now.

07:47.668 --> 07:49.935
- Okay.
- Great, see you soon.

07:50.037 --> 07:52.370
All right, we are gonna go
find Katie,

07:52.473 --> 07:53.472
and see if she wants
to practice

07:53.574 --> 07:55.340
her babysitting skills.

07:55.442 --> 07:57.342
Ungh!
(Footsteps recede)

07:57.444 --> 08:01.046
¶¶¶

08:01.148 --> 08:03.682
(Hooves thud,
tack jingles)

08:03.784 --> 08:05.684
(Hooves thunder,
Platinum Bow grunts)

08:05.786 --> 08:10.021
¶¶¶

08:10.123 --> 08:11.723
(Stopwatch beeps,
hooves thunder past)

08:11.825 --> 08:13.592
- (Exhales deeply)

08:13.694 --> 08:17.162
- If he does that in Kentucky,
Platinum Bow will be a star.

08:19.233 --> 08:21.600
(Platinum Bow grunts)
- He's one in a million.

08:21.702 --> 08:24.936
- I certainly hope so.
(Chuckles, then sighs)

08:25.038 --> 08:27.272
- Lisa, this is my cousin,
Carlos.

08:27.374 --> 08:29.941
He's working with me now.

08:30.043 --> 08:31.977
- Welcome aboard, Carlos.
- Good to be here.

08:32.079 --> 08:33.378
- All right, gentlemen,
thank you.

08:33.480 --> 08:35.413
Um, let's give my beautiful,
new horse

08:35.516 --> 08:36.848
a little bit of
a well-earned rest

08:36.950 --> 08:38.783
and that'll be it for today.

08:38.886 --> 08:40.519
- Hmm. For Bow, maybe.

08:40.621 --> 08:42.521
I've got another horse
I'd like you to breeze.

08:42.623 --> 08:44.289
- Absolutely!

08:44.391 --> 08:47.259
(Challenge snorts)
- Hey!

08:47.361 --> 08:48.627
Come on, Boy!
Amy: Hey, Clint,

08:48.729 --> 08:51.429
how are things?
- Good, all things considered.

08:51.532 --> 08:53.798
Your protégé has been
my saving grace.

08:53.901 --> 08:56.301
He's really stepped up.
- That's great.

08:56.403 --> 08:57.802
- Logan's a huge help
with the other kids.

08:57.905 --> 08:59.437
He's a natural born leader,

08:59.540 --> 09:01.306
and he's really starting
to make a bond with Challenge.

09:01.408 --> 09:04.109
- Well, I told you,
he's a natural with horses.

09:04.211 --> 09:07.078
- I'm worried about him.
- Why?

09:07.180 --> 09:10.215
- He's talking about not going
back to school in the fall.

09:10.317 --> 09:12.117
- (Sighs) Really.

09:12.219 --> 09:14.419
- Says it's a waste of time,
wants to get outta there,

09:14.521 --> 09:16.421
make some money. (Sighs)

09:16.523 --> 09:17.989
I can't tell him what to do.

09:18.091 --> 09:20.559
I'd like him to stay here
at the Centre to help me out,

09:21.828 --> 09:24.029
but there's too many things
up in the air right now.

09:24.131 --> 09:26.197
- Have you talked to Cooper?

09:26.300 --> 09:28.199
- Yeah, I've been
in touch with him.

09:28.302 --> 09:30.569
I think there's more
than a good chance

09:30.671 --> 09:32.804
he might not be back.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.573
- (Heavy sigh)

09:34.675 --> 09:37.342
- I can't oversee things
indefinitely.

09:37.444 --> 09:40.045
And I think this place has
too many financial problems

09:40.147 --> 09:41.880
to sustain itself.

09:41.982 --> 09:44.115
(Clint's phone rings)
Uh...

09:44.217 --> 09:45.650
- You take that.
I'm gonna go talk to him.

09:45.752 --> 09:48.486
(Phone continues ringing
then beeps)

09:48.589 --> 09:50.155
Logan: Come on!
Clint: Hello.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.691
- Hey, how's it goin'?

09:52.793 --> 09:54.593
- Oh, it's good!

09:54.695 --> 09:56.361
(Hooves thud softly)

09:56.463 --> 09:59.464
- And how's this guy doin'?
- He's great.

09:59.566 --> 10:01.266
Yeah, you know, he lets me
ride him whenever now,

10:01.368 --> 10:02.867
no problem.
- That's good.

10:02.970 --> 10:05.837
- Yeah. I'm just, uh, you know,

10:05.939 --> 10:07.872
trying to get as much time
as I can with him while...

10:07.975 --> 10:09.407
while I still can.

10:09.509 --> 10:11.209
- Challenge isn't going
anywhere.

10:11.311 --> 10:13.044
- Yeah, I mean,
he might not be,

10:13.146 --> 10:15.180
but let's face it,

10:15.282 --> 10:17.382
you know, I heard the talk,
this place is goin' down.

10:17.484 --> 10:19.417
- You don't know that, Logan.
- No, it doesn't matter.

10:19.519 --> 10:21.686
I mean, either way,
I gotta make a plan, right?

10:21.788 --> 10:23.388
(Challenge grunts)

10:23.490 --> 10:25.223
Can't be at the group home
forever.

10:25.325 --> 10:29.260
So yeah... I gotta face facts
and get a job.

10:29.363 --> 10:32.297
All right. Come on, Boy.
(Exhales)

10:32.399 --> 10:33.898
(Hooves thud gently)

10:34.001 --> 10:35.400
Chuck: New guy on the block.

10:35.502 --> 10:37.235
Lisa just bought him.

10:37.337 --> 10:39.237
I think he's got great promise.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.106
You take him out
and start him slow and easy,

10:41.208 --> 10:43.875
and then, see what he can do.
- You got it.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.410
(Hands tap lightly on saddle)

10:45.512 --> 10:47.545
(Jacket rustles,
horse grunts)

10:47.648 --> 10:50.749
(Horse snorts,
hooves thud)

10:50.851 --> 10:53.451
(Hooves thunder,
horse snorts discontentedly)

10:53.553 --> 10:54.919
<i> Lisa: Chuck?</i>

10:55.022 --> 10:56.421
That horse hasn't been proven.

10:56.523 --> 10:58.423
Could you not have used
a different jockey?

10:58.525 --> 11:00.225
- It's fine.
He's just breezing him.

11:00.327 --> 11:01.726
- But...
(Hooves thud)

11:01.828 --> 11:03.862
(Plastic bag rattles,
horse whinnies)

11:06.900 --> 11:09.200
(Eddie grunts in pain)

11:11.171 --> 11:13.672
(Legs fall heavily)
Oh no!

11:13.774 --> 11:15.573
- Ow! Agh!
(Running footsteps)

11:15.676 --> 11:18.309
- Agh!
- Relax.

11:18.412 --> 11:20.011
- Hold on, I'm getting the van.
- Just breathe.

11:20.113 --> 11:22.447
- Bring the van to the track,
right now. Right now.

11:26.586 --> 11:29.487
¶¶¶

11:29.589 --> 11:31.489
(Jack sighs,
cutlery clanks)

11:33.093 --> 11:34.693
- Okay, what's goin' on?

11:37.097 --> 11:38.997
- Well, (scoffs)

11:39.099 --> 11:42.600
my jockey, Platinum Bow's
only jockey, Eddie,

11:42.703 --> 11:45.470
was doing some extracurricular
activities today

11:45.572 --> 11:47.472
and broke his foot.
- Oh no.

11:47.574 --> 11:49.607
- Yeah, so, days before
I have to leave for Kentucky,

11:49.710 --> 11:52.610
I have to find a new jockey
and I was... was thinking,

11:52.713 --> 11:56.047
it's just going too well,
something bad is bound to--

11:56.149 --> 11:57.782
- That's going a bit far.
- No, it's not!

11:57.884 --> 12:01.052
It's true! I mean, I bought
this beautiful horse -

12:01.154 --> 12:03.288
it was fortuitous,
I was over the moon -

12:03.390 --> 12:05.857
and then, remember,
he got Potomac fever.

12:05.959 --> 12:07.792
- But you got him better.
- Yes, we did,

12:07.894 --> 12:09.728
and he is in peak condition.

12:09.830 --> 12:13.298
And the new trainer, Chuck,
is amazing, except for today,

12:13.400 --> 12:16.401
and Eddie, a perfect match
for Platinum Bow

12:16.503 --> 12:18.837
and, and look! Look!

12:18.939 --> 12:20.972
The worst thing that could
possibly happen,

12:21.074 --> 12:22.741
days before this
important race,

12:22.843 --> 12:24.943
would put Platinum Bow
on the map...

12:25.045 --> 12:26.511
and I knew it!

12:26.613 --> 12:27.979
I knew everything was going
too well.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.482
- That's a ridiculous
superstition.

12:30.584 --> 12:33.651
- I own racehorses, Jack!

12:33.754 --> 12:35.220
I get to be superstitious.

12:35.322 --> 12:36.654
(Footsteps recede)

12:38.058 --> 12:40.091
- You're not hungry?

12:40.193 --> 12:42.961
- Uh, I'm always just a little
out of it after a long flight.

12:43.063 --> 12:44.896
Uh, would anyone mind
if I turn in early?

12:44.998 --> 12:46.998
- Not at all. Get some rest.
- Okay, good night.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.633
- Night.
- Well, I'll--

12:48.735 --> 12:50.335
- No, stay. Have some dessert,
'kay? I'm fine.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.239
(Footsteps thud,
Lisa sighs)

12:55.509 --> 12:57.642
- I-I have to go back
to Fairfield

12:57.744 --> 12:59.177
and find someone to ride
my horse.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.779
So, I'll see you later.

13:00.881 --> 13:03.047
- (Sighs)
- Wish me luck.

13:03.150 --> 13:05.784
- You know, I totally get
what Lisa was talking about.

13:05.886 --> 13:07.786
You get too happy,
things go bad.

13:07.888 --> 13:10.688
- Oh, come on, Lou.
- It's true.

13:10.791 --> 13:12.791
I mean, look at me and Peter.
We were so good,

13:12.893 --> 13:14.559
and then it's all just gone
kaboom.

13:14.661 --> 13:15.860
- The only reason
it's gone kaboom

13:15.962 --> 13:17.862
is 'cause you haven't
followed through

13:17.964 --> 13:19.597
and made a decision yet.
- It's not that easy.

13:19.699 --> 13:20.799
- It's also not that hard!

13:20.901 --> 13:22.700
You just have to make up
your mind.

13:22.803 --> 13:24.936
- Ugh.
- Make up your mind about what?

13:25.038 --> 13:29.007
- Nothing. Um, you must be
happy Jessica's back.

13:29.109 --> 13:31.810
- Yeah, I am. I'm not sure
she feels the same way.

13:31.912 --> 13:33.878
- Why would you say that?

13:33.980 --> 13:36.214
- Well... I don't think
it's easy for her

13:36.316 --> 13:38.416
to come back and live in a loft
above a barn.

13:38.518 --> 13:41.586
I heard her... condo in New York
was pretty big.

13:41.688 --> 13:42.821
- No, (scoffs)
it wasn't just big,

13:42.923 --> 13:44.823
it was like a mansion
in the sky.

13:44.925 --> 13:46.825
I went there a couple times
for corporate cocktail parties.

13:46.927 --> 13:49.460
It was like something
out of "Architectural Digest."

13:49.563 --> 13:51.129
- Thanks for that.

13:51.231 --> 13:52.964
- Actually, I think someone
did say it was featured

13:53.066 --> 13:54.732
in a design magazine.

13:57.003 --> 13:59.604
(Crickets chirp,
owl hoots)

13:59.706 --> 14:00.905
(Door creaks open)

14:02.008 --> 14:08.913
¶¶¶

14:09.015 --> 14:15.920
¶¶¶

14:16.022 --> 14:23.094
¶¶¶

14:23.196 --> 14:24.162
¶¶¶

14:26.032 --> 14:28.600
(Door creaks shut)

14:28.702 --> 14:30.635
(Screen door snicks open,
inner door clunks shut)

14:30.737 --> 14:33.938
(Amy sighs deeply,
screen door creaks shut)

14:34.040 --> 14:40.745
¶¶¶

14:40.847 --> 14:43.781
(Sighs heavily)

14:43.884 --> 14:47.218
Our little girl starts
kindergarten in a few days, Ty.

14:48.655 --> 14:51.489
I'm not sure how I feel
about it.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.691
It is such a big step.

14:55.662 --> 14:59.030
(Sighs) And I wish you were
here to share it with me.

15:00.767 --> 15:02.367
I love you.

15:02.469 --> 15:06.437
¶¶¶

15:06.539 --> 15:08.139
(Exhales sharply)

15:08.241 --> 15:11.209
¶¶¶

15:11.311 --> 15:14.245
<i> (Footsteps approach slowly)</i>

15:16.616 --> 15:18.449
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

15:19.552 --> 15:21.519
You comin' to bed?

15:22.756 --> 15:24.255
- Can I ask you something?

15:25.358 --> 15:26.824
- What?

15:28.595 --> 15:29.928
- Are you happy?

15:31.798 --> 15:33.464
- Yes, I am happy

15:34.567 --> 15:36.701
to be here with you.

15:36.803 --> 15:38.503
Too happy.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.071
(Horse whinnies downstairs)

15:40.173 --> 15:41.706
(Both snicker)

15:41.808 --> 15:44.676
- You're happy living
in a loft above a barn

15:44.778 --> 15:46.844
instead of a penthouse
on Park Avenue?

15:48.315 --> 15:49.714
- Yeah.

15:50.817 --> 15:52.050
(Lips smack lightly)

15:52.152 --> 15:54.819
¶¶¶

15:54.921 --> 15:57.055
(Gentle knock)
- Do you have a moment?

15:57.157 --> 15:59.724
- Yeah, yeah, of course.

15:59.826 --> 16:02.961
- Um, so I've been thinking
about it,

16:03.063 --> 16:05.096
and the more I do,

16:05.198 --> 16:07.699
the more I realize
I might have upset you

16:07.801 --> 16:10.268
on our camping trip.

16:10.370 --> 16:13.237
- Why do you say that?
We... we had fun!

16:13.340 --> 16:15.640
- We did. It was awesome.

16:17.510 --> 16:20.411
But I said some things
I probably shouldn't have...

16:20.513 --> 16:22.046
about you and Dad.

16:22.148 --> 16:25.249
- (Sighs) Do you mean about
the arguments?

16:25.352 --> 16:27.318
- No.

16:27.420 --> 16:30.421
(Exhales shakily)
I know I said I was fine...

16:30.523 --> 16:32.290
with the way things are
between you and Dad,

16:34.294 --> 16:36.561
but I'm not always fine, Mom.

16:38.431 --> 16:40.999
I'm completely confused
about what I want.

16:41.101 --> 16:42.667
(Inhales deeply)

16:42.769 --> 16:45.003
Because I saw the two of you
together at the wedding...

16:45.105 --> 16:47.905
- (Exhales heavily)
- and I thought...

16:48.008 --> 16:50.475
<i> I really did...</i>

16:50.577 --> 16:52.744
<i> that you might get back</i>
<i> together.</i>

16:52.846 --> 16:54.278
(Stifled sob)

16:54.381 --> 16:57.482
- That we could be
a family again.

16:57.584 --> 16:59.017
(Inhales and exhales shakily)

16:59.119 --> 17:02.086
I didn't wanna get my hopes up
and...

17:02.188 --> 17:04.055
- Come here. Come here.

17:04.157 --> 17:06.491
Hey, it's okay, it's okay.

17:06.593 --> 17:11.162
¶¶¶

17:15.468 --> 17:17.802
(Birds chirp)

17:19.005 --> 17:20.805
(Screen door snaps shut,
truck door clunks shut)

17:20.907 --> 17:23.041
- Good morning, Lou!
- Hey, you.

17:23.143 --> 17:24.909
- Is, uh, Tim around today?

17:25.011 --> 17:27.111
- Tim is up in the loft.

17:27.213 --> 17:29.213
- So...

17:29.315 --> 17:31.215
how are things?

17:31.317 --> 17:32.917
You know, life?
- Uh... (Chuckles)

17:33.019 --> 17:35.119
Life is okay.

17:35.221 --> 17:36.654
Uh, why?

17:36.756 --> 17:38.589
- I know about you and Peter.

17:39.793 --> 17:41.959
- You do.
- Uh-huh.

17:42.062 --> 17:45.063
Look, Peter and I, we had
a big talk at Tim's wedding.

17:45.165 --> 17:47.065
Hey, look--not that he needed
to tell me anything -

17:47.167 --> 17:48.833
the look on his face.

17:48.935 --> 17:50.435
I'm not stupid.
- Caleb--

17:50.537 --> 17:52.370
- The guy's still in love
with you, Lou,

17:52.472 --> 17:53.971
after all these years.

17:54.074 --> 17:56.474
So? Are you guys back together?

17:57.844 --> 17:59.277
- It's complicated.

18:00.914 --> 18:02.246
- It doesn't need to be.

18:03.550 --> 18:05.349
I'm rooting for you guys.

18:05.452 --> 18:06.984
(Footsteps crunch)

18:07.087 --> 18:13.624
¶¶¶

18:13.726 --> 18:16.094
(Phone rings)

18:16.196 --> 18:18.496
(Footsteps approach)
- Who's that?

18:18.598 --> 18:20.498
- Uh, wrong number.
(Ringing ends abruptly)

18:20.600 --> 18:22.100
<i> - Hey, Tim, you up there?</i>

18:22.202 --> 18:23.968
(Footsteps thud,
Caleb chuckles)

18:24.070 --> 18:26.104
Hey, guys, sorry.
Glad you're both decent.

18:26.206 --> 18:28.673
- Yeah, we are glad, too.
- You coulda knocked.

18:28.775 --> 18:30.308
- Well, I thought I did.

18:30.410 --> 18:33.111
Hey, do you have the saddles
for the school?

18:33.213 --> 18:34.779
I got time to drop 'em off now,
if you want.

18:34.881 --> 18:37.448
- You should knock.
- You should get a door.

18:38.818 --> 18:41.319
- Uh, hi, it's Lou Fleming.

18:41.421 --> 18:43.387
Yeah, hi.
Is, um, is Peter around?

18:43.490 --> 18:45.923
He didn't answer
his cell phone.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.127
He's where?

18:50.230 --> 18:52.330
Oh.

18:52.432 --> 18:55.233
No, no, he um...
he didn't mention it.

18:56.503 --> 18:58.035
Mm-hmm.

18:58.138 --> 19:00.571
Okay, thank you.
(Footsteps approach)

19:02.142 --> 19:04.575
- Okay, there's been a change
in your schedule.

19:04.677 --> 19:06.677
- Yeah, you bet there's been
a change.

19:06.779 --> 19:09.013
Complete 180.
(Phone thumps)

19:09.115 --> 19:10.281
(Sighs)

19:10.383 --> 19:12.483
I made the call!

19:12.585 --> 19:14.051
To Peter.

19:14.154 --> 19:16.154
And guess what?
(Hands slap)

19:16.256 --> 19:18.022
He wasn't there.
- So?

19:18.124 --> 19:20.558
- So, just when I decided
to talk to him,

19:20.660 --> 19:22.226
needed...

19:22.328 --> 19:24.162
needed to talk to him,

19:24.264 --> 19:27.064
he's away... on business.

19:27.167 --> 19:29.700
Didn't even bother to tell me
he was going.

19:29.802 --> 19:31.836
Did you know he was always
away on business

19:31.938 --> 19:33.804
when we were married?
Like, all the time,

19:33.907 --> 19:35.573
and obviously,
he always will be.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.742
Like what was I thinking?

19:37.844 --> 19:39.510
Do you know where he is?

19:39.612 --> 19:41.746
Paris.
- Ontario?

19:41.848 --> 19:43.814
- No! Ugh! France!

19:43.917 --> 19:45.316
And, and... and, and...

19:45.418 --> 19:47.185
he was supposed to propose
to me there,

19:47.287 --> 19:49.587
but it turned into
a business trip.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.622
- Okay, but like,
how many years ago was that?

19:51.724 --> 19:53.925
- It doesn't matter!
Nothing has changed!

19:54.027 --> 19:56.060
God, why? Why did I think
it would change?

19:56.162 --> 19:57.962
- Lou, come on,
you're overreacting.

19:58.064 --> 19:59.764
- No. Do you know, I'm not.

19:59.866 --> 20:02.600
I am just back where I started,
which is abandoned.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.202
I... (Hands thump)

20:04.304 --> 20:06.003
I can't-- I gotta get
outta here.

20:06.105 --> 20:07.305
- No, no, no, you can't.

20:07.407 --> 20:09.307
You've, you've got a meeting
in an hour.

20:09.409 --> 20:11.175
- Cancel it.
- I can't!

20:11.277 --> 20:12.877
- (Sighs) Okay.

20:12.979 --> 20:14.845
Alexa, cancel my meeting
for 4:00 p.m. today.

20:14.948 --> 20:17.281
<i> Alexa: Delete your meeting</i>
<i> at 4:00 p.m. Right?</i>

20:17.383 --> 20:19.984
- Right.
- Okay, done.

20:20.086 --> 20:22.553
- See, I like her.
She listens to me.

20:22.655 --> 20:25.223
- Lou, come on,
just call Peter.

20:25.325 --> 20:26.891
- Fine!

20:26.993 --> 20:30.127
Alexa what time is it
in Paris?

20:30.230 --> 20:33.464
<i> - In Paris, it's 11:13 p.m.</i>

20:33.566 --> 20:35.233
- Oh, shoot!

20:35.335 --> 20:39.003
Way too late to call Peter.
- (Sighs heavily)

20:40.340 --> 20:43.674
(Hooves thud evenly)

20:46.980 --> 20:48.246
(Stopwatch beeps)

20:49.349 --> 20:51.249
Slow time.
Not even close to Eddie.

20:51.351 --> 20:53.117
- (Frustrated sigh)
- I'm so sorry.

20:53.219 --> 20:55.052
- No, it's bad luck
and a plastic bag.

20:55.154 --> 20:56.387
It's not your fault.
- It doesn't matter

20:56.489 --> 20:58.256
whose fault it is.
We're going to Kentucky

20:58.358 --> 21:00.524
and we don't have a...
we don't have a jockey, so.

21:00.627 --> 21:02.159
(Frustrated exhale)

21:02.262 --> 21:03.694
- Carlos!
- (Sighs)

21:03.796 --> 21:05.463
- Could you give my cousin
a shot?

21:05.565 --> 21:07.131
He's the one who exercises
Platinum Bow,

21:07.233 --> 21:08.599
and they're good together.

21:08.701 --> 21:10.868
Carlos has a feel for him.
(Footsteps shuffle)

21:10.970 --> 21:12.803
- Are you a jockey?
- Yes,

21:12.905 --> 21:14.705
I apprenticed in Buenos Aires.

21:14.807 --> 21:18.276
- Oh! Well, yes, let's...
let's see what you got.

21:18.378 --> 21:23.180
¶¶¶

21:23.283 --> 21:26.917
(Hooves thunder)

21:27.020 --> 21:29.287
(Stopwatch beeps)
- Well?

21:29.389 --> 21:30.621
- (Gasps) Oh my goodness!
- He's okay?

21:30.723 --> 21:32.857
- Oh, he's incredible!
He's--You are lucky!

21:32.959 --> 21:34.558
- (Laughs)
- You are very lucky!

21:34.661 --> 21:36.727
Oh my goodness,
it's so exciting!

21:36.829 --> 21:40.298
¶ Finding it hard to believe ¶

21:40.400 --> 21:43.167
¶ I couldn't be feeling
any better now ¶

21:43.269 --> 21:44.568
- You can't quit school.

21:44.671 --> 21:46.637
¶ And I don't wanna live
forever now ¶

21:46.739 --> 21:48.906
- Why not?
- (Sighs)

21:49.008 --> 21:51.642
Because. Not when you're
this close to graduating.

21:51.744 --> 21:54.312
Look, I was never an A-student,

21:54.414 --> 21:56.380
but I stuck it out.

21:56.482 --> 21:59.650
And I've always regretted
not going further.

21:59.752 --> 22:01.218
(Inhales deeply)

22:01.321 --> 22:03.587
Did I ever tell you that
my husband went back

22:03.690 --> 22:05.222
and finished high school,

22:05.325 --> 22:07.191
and then went on to college
to become a vet?

22:07.293 --> 22:09.660
- Yeah. Yeah, Clint told me
all about Ty.

22:10.963 --> 22:12.330
You know, he um...

22:13.433 --> 22:15.333
says I remind him of him.

22:16.502 --> 22:19.103
- You do. You know...

22:20.239 --> 22:22.073
you can do anything
you put your mind to.

22:22.175 --> 22:23.341
- (Chuckles lightly)

22:23.443 --> 22:25.209
Right, like I'm gonna get
to go to college.

22:25.311 --> 22:27.945
- Why not? Have you ever
even thought about it?

22:28.047 --> 22:29.547
- (Exhales)

22:29.649 --> 22:32.350
Why would I?

22:32.452 --> 22:34.352
- (Sighs)

22:36.356 --> 22:38.255
You know, I'm gonna go find

22:38.358 --> 22:40.891
Ty's college course books

22:40.993 --> 22:43.260
and you can see
how many amazing options

22:43.363 --> 22:45.096
there are for you,

22:45.198 --> 22:47.565
but only if you finish
high school.

22:47.667 --> 22:49.433
- You never give up, do you?

22:49.535 --> 22:51.369
- I don't,

22:51.471 --> 22:54.372
and neither do you.
(Footsteps recede)

22:56.075 --> 22:57.908
(Birds chirp)

22:58.010 --> 22:59.810
(Crickets chirp)

23:00.913 --> 23:03.114
(Books thump lightly)

23:03.216 --> 23:06.050
(Drawer slides open,
items rustle)

23:09.589 --> 23:13.157
(Metal drawers slide open
and closed)

23:17.263 --> 23:18.629
(Horses thump and whinny
in the barn)

23:18.731 --> 23:20.398
(Pages flutter)

23:22.068 --> 23:23.401
(Book plunks,
Amy gasps)

23:27.907 --> 23:30.174

envelope rustles)

23:38.985 --> 23:40.751

23:45.858 --> 23:47.691
(Footsteps thud)

23:51.197 --> 23:52.696

23:55.535 --> 23:57.768

24:03.075 --> 24:05.309

the horseshoe)

24:33.773 --> 24:36.574

24:36.676 --> 24:39.243
<i> How Heartland changed my life.</i>

24:39.345 --> 24:40.945

24:43.149 --> 24:44.615

25:21.954 --> 25:24.822
(Hooves clop gently,
Platinum Bow grunts)

25:24.924 --> 25:27.858
(Hooves thunk loudly
on the ramp)

25:27.960 --> 25:30.995
Lisa: All right, just make sure
he's settled properly.

25:31.097 --> 25:33.397
I'll be right there.

25:33.499 --> 25:34.965
(Exhales nervously)

25:36.402 --> 25:37.801
(Exhausted laugh)

25:40.506 --> 25:41.805
I love you.

25:41.908 --> 25:43.807
- I love you, too.

25:43.910 --> 25:46.677
- Wish me luck.
- The best luck.

25:48.047 --> 25:50.881
- And, um, you know...
watch the race!

25:52.218 --> 25:54.285
- Maybe I will.
- (Laughs)

25:55.388 --> 25:56.820
Lisa: Thank you.

(Lips smack)

26:00.927 --> 26:02.326

26:13.973 --> 26:15.906
(Truck rumbles away)

26:18.077 --> 26:22.146
¶¶¶

26:22.248 --> 26:23.981
(Door clicks open)

26:24.083 --> 26:26.116
- Hey! What's goin' on?
Where's Lou?

26:26.218 --> 26:28.352
- Hey, Peter.
Uh, it is so good to see you.

26:28.454 --> 26:29.853
How was your flight?

26:29.956 --> 26:31.589
- It was long and turbulent,
Rick.

26:31.691 --> 26:33.891
Can you tell me what happened,
please? Is Lou all right?

26:33.993 --> 26:35.326
- Of course, she is!

26:35.428 --> 26:36.727
- She is.
- Yes!

26:37.964 --> 26:39.697
- (Sharp exhale) You told me
it was an emergency;

26:39.799 --> 26:41.465
that I had to get home
right away.

26:41.567 --> 26:43.133
I just grabbed the first
flight out of Paris, Rick.

26:43.235 --> 26:44.668
- And perhaps that's
the best decision

26:44.770 --> 26:46.370
you ever could have made.
- Rick!

26:46.472 --> 26:48.172
- Let me explain.
Her Mayorship,

26:48.274 --> 26:50.608
she may not be the easiest
boss to work for,

26:50.710 --> 26:53.711
and for the last month alone
she has been near impossible.

26:53.813 --> 26:55.613
I mean, I cannot tell you
how many times

26:55.715 --> 26:57.615
I've been this close
to quitting,

26:57.717 --> 27:00.217
and I, Sir, am no quitter.
- Stop, Rick. Stop, please.

27:00.319 --> 27:02.019
I haven't slept in two days.

27:02.121 --> 27:03.721
Can you get to the point,
please?

27:03.823 --> 27:06.624
- The point is Lou may drive me
absolutely bonkers,

27:06.726 --> 27:08.525
but she's my friend

27:08.628 --> 27:10.894
and I couldn't just sit here
and watch her suffer.

27:10.997 --> 27:13.631
- And you think that I'm
the cause of that suffering.

27:13.733 --> 27:15.532
- You did leave, didn't you,

27:15.635 --> 27:16.867
just when Lou needed you
the most,

27:16.969 --> 27:19.436
when she was making a big
decision about her life?

27:19.538 --> 27:21.038
- Yeah, I would've made that
decision with her,

27:21.140 --> 27:23.407
if that's what she wanted,
Rick, but she didn't.

27:23.509 --> 27:25.242
She wanted to make it on
her own. Do you unders--

27:25.344 --> 27:26.644
What do you even know about
any of this?

27:26.746 --> 27:28.879
- Everything. I mean, I realize
it's none of my business--

27:28.981 --> 27:30.881
- No, it isn't, actually.
- Yeah, and I've tried my best

27:30.983 --> 27:32.650
to stay out of it,
I really have,

27:32.752 --> 27:35.853
but Lou means a lot to me and...
so do you.

27:35.955 --> 27:38.656
I mean, it's no secret I've
been Team Peter from the start,

27:38.758 --> 27:41.792
but you both obviously need
someone, an outside person

27:41.894 --> 27:44.428
to help, you know,
put things in motion.

27:44.530 --> 27:46.430
- (Scoffs) Right.

27:46.532 --> 27:48.966
And you think you're just
the person to do that?

27:49.068 --> 27:52.670
- Well, unfortunately,
it has fallen upon me, yes.

27:52.772 --> 27:54.972
<i> I mean...</i>
<i> Lou: Peter?</i>

27:55.074 --> 27:56.407
- Hey. (Scoffs)

27:56.509 --> 27:58.008
- What're you doing here?

27:58.110 --> 28:00.010
You were supposed to be
in Paris!

28:00.112 --> 28:02.012
- Yeah, I was, but I was
under the impression

28:02.114 --> 28:03.681
that you were in trouble,

28:03.783 --> 28:05.683
or that you had some sort
of accident, or something.

28:05.785 --> 28:07.451
Somebody led me to believe

28:07.553 --> 28:09.219
that there was an emergency
situation.

28:09.321 --> 28:11.689
(Unamused exhale)
- What did you do?

28:11.791 --> 28:13.924
- What I had to. I made a call.

28:14.026 --> 28:17.227
So, you two are gonna figure
things out, face to face,

28:17.329 --> 28:19.563
and you're gonna make a
decision before it's too late.

28:21.267 --> 28:22.966
Before you both end up losing.

28:23.069 --> 28:27.471
So, I'm gonna leave you to it
and you both are welcome.

28:30.276 --> 28:32.710
(Door slams)
- (Snorts sharply)

28:32.812 --> 28:34.578
- (Sighs)
- Hi.

28:37.249 --> 28:38.849
- I've decided what I want
to do with the money

28:38.951 --> 28:40.584
Lily gave me.

28:40.686 --> 28:42.720
I'm going to invest it
in the Centre.

28:42.822 --> 28:45.355
- Oh, wait a minute.

28:45.458 --> 28:47.858
From what's been said about
the financial situation there,

28:47.960 --> 28:49.626
I don't know.

28:49.729 --> 28:50.894
- Not all of it.

28:50.996 --> 28:53.464
I will put some aside
for Lyndy's future.

28:53.566 --> 28:54.832
But... Grandpa,

28:54.934 --> 28:57.034
when I see a kid like Logan,

28:57.136 --> 28:59.069
I know what I have to do.

28:59.171 --> 29:00.938
Logan needs that place.

29:01.040 --> 29:04.975
It's like... it's like what
Heartland was for Ty.

29:05.077 --> 29:08.345
That centre could be a haven
for so many kids,

29:08.447 --> 29:10.347
if it's allowed to grow.

29:11.450 --> 29:14.618
And Ty and I can leave
a legacy together,

29:14.720 --> 29:16.153
just like he wanted.

29:16.255 --> 29:21.391
¶¶¶

29:21.494 --> 29:23.360
And I think Lily
would approve, too.

29:25.931 --> 29:28.198
- So will Clint, I'd wager.

29:30.269 --> 29:32.102
- I'm gonna call them.

29:32.204 --> 29:33.670
(Phone beeps)

29:36.108 --> 29:38.342
Lily, hi, it's Amy.

29:38.444 --> 29:40.377
I wanna talk to you
about your generous gift.

29:41.647 --> 29:43.647
(Leaves rustle in the wind,
hooves thud leisurely)

29:43.749 --> 29:45.382
- Amy always says a trail ride

29:45.484 --> 29:47.684
is the best way
to clear your head.

29:47.787 --> 29:49.720
My head has been the farthest
thing from clear

29:49.822 --> 29:52.523
ever since... you left.

29:52.625 --> 29:55.459
- Well, I didn't leave.
Just waitin'.

29:55.561 --> 29:57.361
- And I've kept you waiting,
and I'm sorry.

29:57.463 --> 29:58.862
- No, don't apologize.

29:58.964 --> 30:01.465
I told ya I was gonna give you
time to... make a decision.

30:03.102 --> 30:04.668
- Do you mind if we stop
for awhile?

30:04.770 --> 30:06.904
(Horse snorts)
- Yeah, sure.

30:07.006 --> 30:08.705
Whoa.

30:08.808 --> 30:10.073
(Saddles creak,
grass crunches)

30:10.176 --> 30:11.475
(Horse grunts)

30:11.577 --> 30:13.277
- You know, when you were
here last,

30:13.379 --> 30:15.245
that time we had together,

30:15.347 --> 30:17.915
it was magic. I...

30:18.017 --> 30:20.684
I've never been happier.

30:20.786 --> 30:22.820
But then, I was on my own,

30:22.922 --> 30:25.889
and I started questioning
everything.

30:25.991 --> 30:27.825
What would it look like
if we got back together?

30:27.927 --> 30:30.227
How would it work?
The pros, the cons.

30:30.329 --> 30:32.896
You know me.
- I do.

30:32.998 --> 30:34.498
- But I realized something.

30:34.600 --> 30:36.900
I realized that all throughout
our marriage,

30:37.002 --> 30:39.436
I had this picture perfect idea
in my head

30:39.538 --> 30:42.105
of what it should be,
what it should look like.

30:42.208 --> 30:44.975
And I was so aware
of our flaws, I...

30:45.077 --> 30:47.411
I would look for them.
I created them.

30:50.950 --> 30:54.084
But I don't care about
perfect anymore, Peter.

30:54.186 --> 30:56.520
I mean, look at us,

30:56.622 --> 30:58.422
we've been doing this
all of these years,

30:58.524 --> 31:00.390
raising our girls together.

31:00.492 --> 31:01.859
And I'm more in love
with you now

31:01.961 --> 31:03.760
than I have ever been.

31:05.598 --> 31:07.497
- Me, me too.

31:07.600 --> 31:09.867
- So, if we do this again,

31:09.969 --> 31:12.135
I wanna do things differently.

31:12.238 --> 31:13.937
- Yeah. No, exactly.
Yeah, th-th-that--

31:14.039 --> 31:15.739
I mean, that's what's
I've been saying. We--

31:15.841 --> 31:17.474
- Right. We don't, we don't
need to be traditional.

31:17.576 --> 31:19.009
We're better when we're not.

31:20.112 --> 31:22.212
- Okay, so, um...

31:22.314 --> 31:23.881
so what are you saying?

31:26.051 --> 31:28.218
- I'm saying... yes.

31:29.455 --> 31:32.122
I think we should give
ourselves a new beginning.

31:32.224 --> 31:34.558
I think we deserve it.

31:34.660 --> 31:37.461
And I know it won't be perfect,

31:37.563 --> 31:39.429
but it'll be perfect for us.

31:39.531 --> 31:42.532
I'm a hundred percent sure.

31:42.635 --> 31:44.434
- A hundred percent?
- (Laughs) Yes!

31:44.536 --> 31:46.203
- A hundred, hundred percent?
- Yes!

31:48.307 --> 31:50.574
(Lips smack)
Are you sure?

31:50.676 --> 31:51.909
- (Whispers) Yes.

31:53.145 --> 31:54.811
(Lips smack)

31:56.916 --> 31:59.216
- Thank you. I'll-I'll...
I'll pass the message on.

32:00.452 --> 32:02.219
All right.
(Phone beeps off)

32:05.891 --> 32:07.524
(Stool scrapes,
Tim sighs heavily)

32:07.626 --> 32:09.192
<i> Jessica: Did I leave my phone</i>
<i> up here?</i>

32:09.295 --> 32:11.028
(Footsteps thud)

32:11.130 --> 32:14.564
<i> Oh! Thank goodness.</i>
<i> I thought I lost it.</i>

32:15.834 --> 32:17.567
- What's wrong?

32:21.140 --> 32:23.840
- I just picked up a call.

32:23.943 --> 32:27.077
It... it was your doctor,
from New York.

32:30.916 --> 32:33.850
I told him I was
your husband and...

32:33.953 --> 32:35.218
he just wanted to know why

32:35.321 --> 32:37.955
you hadn't answered
any of his calls.

32:38.057 --> 32:40.691
Apparently, his office had left
a number of messages

32:40.793 --> 32:42.159
while you were in New York.

32:43.662 --> 32:45.562
And he wanted me to ask you
to make an appointment

32:45.664 --> 32:48.732
with a Dr. Wilson, in Calgary.

32:52.972 --> 32:55.572
Wh... why didn't you go
to your appointment?

32:55.674 --> 32:57.641
- I did.

32:59.178 --> 33:01.411
(Inhales) And then I had
some follow-up tests.

33:01.513 --> 33:04.648
And, uh, they said that if I...

33:05.951 --> 33:07.751
didn't hear anything,
that everything was fine,

33:07.853 --> 33:09.119
and if I did that...

33:10.289 --> 33:12.255
you know, that wasn't
a good sign.

33:12.358 --> 33:14.191
So, the day before I left
to come home,

33:14.293 --> 33:15.993
I got a message to call.

33:17.296 --> 33:19.096
- And you didn't.

33:22.634 --> 33:24.735
Why?

33:26.005 --> 33:27.337
- 'Cause...

33:28.440 --> 33:30.140
I got a message, so.

33:32.111 --> 33:33.810
(Phone thumps lightly)

33:33.912 --> 33:36.580
(Feet shuffle nervously)

33:36.682 --> 33:39.583
Well, you know,
that's not good news.

33:41.720 --> 33:43.887
(Sniffles) It's just,
I got scared, okay?

33:43.989 --> 33:45.155
Everything from my first
diagnosis,

33:45.257 --> 33:46.690
it just came rushing back.
I just, I couldn't,

33:46.792 --> 33:48.458
I just couldn't do it.

33:48.560 --> 33:50.360
- I get it.

33:52.564 --> 33:55.365
But that's... that's important.

33:58.470 --> 33:59.903
- I know.

34:00.005 --> 34:01.638
You know, I was just,
I was so happy.

34:01.740 --> 34:03.373
I just...

34:03.475 --> 34:06.810
All I wanted to do was
to come back here, to you,

34:07.913 --> 34:09.346
and then, I got that message

34:09.448 --> 34:11.281
and I just knew that something
bad was gonna happen

34:11.383 --> 34:13.383
because obviously,
I was just too happy.

34:13.485 --> 34:15.685
- Wh... why would you think
that?

34:15.788 --> 34:17.954
- 'Cause that's the way
that it works.

34:18.057 --> 34:19.656
You know, you're on top
of the world,

34:19.758 --> 34:21.958
you think that everything
is gonna stay that way,

34:22.061 --> 34:23.693
and then, all of a sudden,
something happens

34:24.930 --> 34:26.797
and it's the universe saying,

34:26.899 --> 34:29.466
"Jessica, you are not gonna get
your happy ending--"

34:29.568 --> 34:31.134
- Okay.
- "Because you... because you

34:31.236 --> 34:33.336
took it for granted."

34:34.640 --> 34:35.972
(Sniffles)

34:36.075 --> 34:37.607
(Hands slap her sides)

34:38.911 --> 34:40.977
I'm scared. (Sobs)

34:41.080 --> 34:45.949
¶¶¶

34:46.051 --> 34:47.818
- We're gonna make
the appointment.

34:50.189 --> 34:53.090
And no matter what news we get,

34:53.192 --> 34:55.759
we're gonna deal with it.

34:55.861 --> 34:57.994
Together.

34:58.097 --> 35:00.931
- Okay. Okay. (Sobbing)

35:05.637 --> 35:07.737
(Sobs and sniffles)

35:13.112 --> 35:14.911
- Sweetie, you got a second?
Um...

35:15.013 --> 35:17.714
- Dad? What's up?
- Um...

35:17.816 --> 35:20.117
we just wanted to uh...
tell you something.

35:20.219 --> 35:22.786
- Yeah.
- Um...

35:22.888 --> 35:25.989
We've thought about this
for a long time,

35:27.092 --> 35:29.893
and uh... uh, we wanted
to make sure.

35:29.995 --> 35:31.561
- Uh, we took our time,
I took my time.

35:31.663 --> 35:33.630
- Right, Mom took her time.
Well, we both did,

35:33.732 --> 35:35.332
because we wanted to be
absolutely certain

35:35.434 --> 35:37.167
we're doing the right thing.
- And we are.

35:37.269 --> 35:39.202
We're a 100 percent certain.
- Right.

35:39.304 --> 35:41.605
- Can you guys just cut
to the chase?

35:41.707 --> 35:45.475
Because I know what's coming.
I mean, I do know, right?

35:45.577 --> 35:47.144
- Yeah, I-I think you know.

35:47.246 --> 35:49.279
- We love each other very much

35:49.381 --> 35:51.815
and we've decided to give
ourselves a second chance.

35:51.917 --> 35:53.350
- But it's not just a chance

35:53.452 --> 35:55.152
because we know we can
make it work.

35:55.254 --> 35:57.020
- Right.
Katie: (Relieved exhale)

35:57.122 --> 35:59.156
- We're getting back together
is what we're saying.

35:59.258 --> 36:01.791
- (Laughs excitedly)
Both: (Laugh joyously)

36:01.894 --> 36:04.761
- So, how is this gonna work?
Are you moving back?

36:04.863 --> 36:07.430
- No, our living situation
won't change.

36:07.533 --> 36:09.199
Your dad will stay
in Vancouver.

36:09.301 --> 36:11.401
- Right, and Mom will-will
stay here, of course,

36:11.503 --> 36:14.404
but, um, but we are gonna
be together,

36:14.506 --> 36:16.773
you know, as a family,
from now on, I-I promise.

36:16.875 --> 36:19.042
- And I think we should start
by all taking a trip

36:19.144 --> 36:20.710
down to Florida

36:20.812 --> 36:23.280
to tell Georgie the good news.
How's that sound?

36:23.382 --> 36:25.282
- It sounds perfect!
- (Chuckles happily)

36:25.384 --> 36:27.651
- It all does!
- Yeah?

36:27.753 --> 36:29.286
- (Laughs happily)
- Come here.

36:35.160 --> 36:37.294
Clint: Well, here we are.

36:37.396 --> 36:39.596
Look, I just wanna say a few
words about this young woman

36:39.698 --> 36:42.766
who's, uh,
standing beside me here -

36:42.868 --> 36:45.402
a few words about
her generosity.

36:45.504 --> 36:48.972
A young woman who has been here
for this Centre since it began,

36:49.074 --> 36:51.107
and even before that,

36:51.210 --> 36:53.810
and now this amazing donation

36:53.912 --> 36:55.946
<i> to help keep it alive.</i>

36:57.649 --> 37:00.417
<i> We can't thank you enough.</i>

37:00.519 --> 37:02.118
Amy.

37:03.422 --> 37:07.357
- First, I'd like to say
what a difference Clint made

37:07.459 --> 37:09.859
to my husband, Ty Borden.

37:09.962 --> 37:12.229
You changed his life.

37:12.331 --> 37:14.464
Completely turned it around.

37:14.566 --> 37:16.233
- Well, I think,
I think your mother, Marion,

37:16.335 --> 37:18.868
and Heartland had something
to do with that.

37:18.971 --> 37:22.539
Not to mention the fact
that Ty met you

37:22.641 --> 37:25.242
and then fell head over heels.

37:25.344 --> 37:27.711
- Well, you were
a great influence

37:27.813 --> 37:29.846
and inspiration to him.

37:29.948 --> 37:32.716
Don't forget that.
(Horse nickers)

37:32.818 --> 37:34.784
Uh, I don't wanna make
a big speech here.

37:34.886 --> 37:36.987
I... I just want to tell you

37:37.089 --> 37:39.789
about something
I found recently.

37:39.891 --> 37:42.926
A special gift that Ty
was planning to give me

37:43.028 --> 37:44.928
<i> on our sixth anniversary.</i>

37:46.598 --> 37:48.531
It's a horseshoe.

37:48.634 --> 37:50.867
I know, romantic, right?
(Laughs)

37:50.969 --> 37:55.038
It's engraved with the words,
"Stronger Together."

37:57.042 --> 38:00.277
And I hope that now this centre
only gets stronger

38:01.513 --> 38:03.813
and continues to thrive.

38:04.983 --> 38:08.418
I want this to be Ty's legacy,

38:08.520 --> 38:10.487
and mine.

38:10.589 --> 38:12.756
And Lily, Ty's mom, she...

38:12.858 --> 38:14.291
she wants this, too.

38:15.494 --> 38:17.627
And, deep in my heart, I know

38:17.729 --> 38:20.563
that Ty would be thrilled
to do his part.

38:20.666 --> 38:24.167

38:41.987 --> 38:43.420
(Challenge exhales and snorts)

38:43.522 --> 38:45.455
Clint: I'm looking forward
to staying on here,

38:45.557 --> 38:47.190
help things run smoothly.

38:47.292 --> 38:48.658
- Yeah, it was great
to hear that.

38:48.760 --> 38:50.627
- Well, turns out
the powers that be,

38:50.729 --> 38:52.896
they have faith in this place.
- And so they should!

38:52.998 --> 38:56.066
I was glad.
I'm sure he is, too.

38:57.336 --> 38:58.735
- Hey, Logan!
(Hooves thud softly)

38:58.837 --> 39:00.670
How'd you like to move out
of the group home

39:00.772 --> 39:02.605
and bunk in here at the Centre?

39:03.842 --> 39:05.742
- Oh... wow!

39:05.844 --> 39:07.110
Really?

39:07.212 --> 39:08.678
- Yeah, but I'm actually
offering you a job.

39:08.780 --> 39:10.547
- Okay.

39:10.649 --> 39:12.349
- You know, you'll look after
the horses,

39:12.451 --> 39:14.217
and the kids
who come through here,

39:14.319 --> 39:16.152
but there is one condition:

39:16.254 --> 39:18.355
that you finish high school
in Hudson.

39:18.457 --> 39:20.357
- All right.

39:20.459 --> 39:22.592
Yeah, no, I think I could
stick it out.

39:22.694 --> 39:24.361
You know, there were actually
some cool things

39:24.463 --> 39:26.496
in that college book
Amy gave me, so...

39:26.598 --> 39:30.233
Yeah, I'll do my best.
- Okay. Duly noted.

39:30.335 --> 39:31.601
- (Amused chuckle)

39:31.703 --> 39:33.370
I'm gonna hold you to that.

39:33.472 --> 39:36.973
¶¶¶

39:37.075 --> 39:39.376

39:44.483 --> 39:46.383
- I'm kinda nervous about this.

I don't get nervous
at horse races. (Laughs)
