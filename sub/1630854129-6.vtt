WEBVTT

00:03.699 --> 00:06.006
We appreciate
all you two have done,

00:06.006 --> 00:07.746
but if this situation with Javi

00:07.746 --> 00:10.010
<i>isn't going to work out
long-term,</i>

00:10.010 --> 00:11.228
I need to know that now

00:11.228 --> 00:13.317
so we can start looking
for a new home.

00:13.317 --> 00:14.405
So how's everything going?

00:14.405 --> 00:16.494
<i>He's a great kid.</i>

00:16.494 --> 00:19.193
<i>Me and Chloe are getting
pretty attached.</i>

00:19.193 --> 00:21.891
He was picked up
on a drunk and disorderly.

00:21.891 --> 00:23.153
Evening, Lieutenant.

00:23.153 --> 00:24.502
<i>Do you have
any friends at all</i>

00:24.502 --> 00:26.069
that you could've called
to come and bail you out?

00:26.069 --> 00:27.766
Or are you just some kind
of train wreck?

00:27.766 --> 00:29.725
<i>For all 24 hours
of every shift,</i>

00:29.725 --> 00:31.118
<i>you own my ass.</i>

00:31.118 --> 00:34.034
But when I punch out,
that's my time.

00:35.470 --> 00:36.949
You know Faye,
the paramedicine patient

00:36.949 --> 00:38.647
I always talk about?

00:38.647 --> 00:40.823
Uh, yeah, she plays gin rummy
and makes a mean jerk chicken.

00:40.823 --> 00:42.216
- That's the one.
- Mm-hmm.

00:42.216 --> 00:44.522
She just got the all-clear
with her cancer scan.

00:44.522 --> 00:46.742
- That's awesome!
- Yeah, it is.

00:46.742 --> 00:48.265
The only downside is that,
I mean,

00:48.265 --> 00:49.788
she's off the
paramedicine roster,

00:49.788 --> 00:51.312
so I'll have to clear
my social calendar

00:51.312 --> 00:53.879
for a gin rummy night.

00:53.879 --> 00:55.055
Hey, morning.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.621
- Morning.
- Hey.

00:56.621 --> 00:58.971
Hey, it was good to see you
last night at Molly's, Vi.

00:58.971 --> 01:01.191
Yeah, it's been nice
having you around more often.

01:01.191 --> 01:03.367
Except when you
kicked my ass at darts.

01:03.367 --> 01:05.021
Well, I can't help
my natural skill, Gallo.

01:05.021 --> 01:06.631
You know that.

01:06.631 --> 01:09.156
Carver, why aren't you
ever at Molly's?

01:09.156 --> 01:10.635
I'm there now and then.

01:10.635 --> 01:12.594
I like to mix it up,
that's all.

01:12.594 --> 01:14.465
Different night,
different adventure.

01:17.599 --> 01:20.428
Three months in, Carver's
still an all-out mystery.

01:22.821 --> 01:24.258
Hey, look.

01:31.439 --> 01:34.355
Uh, don't do that!
Invasion of privacy.

01:34.355 --> 01:37.053
Come on,
there's no privacy anymore.

01:37.053 --> 01:38.098
He's not wrong.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.229
I don't like this.

01:41.144 --> 01:42.972
Ooh, does he have any
pictures taped up in there?

01:42.972 --> 01:44.452
Oh, I didn't see any.

01:44.452 --> 01:49.587
I see deodorant,
change of clothes, no pictures.

01:50.936 --> 01:52.590
- Hmm.
- That's it?

01:52.590 --> 01:54.070
Man could be a serial killer,
for all we know.

01:55.550 --> 01:58.422
<i>Engine 51, Truck 81,
Squad 3, Ambulance 61.</i>

01:58.422 --> 02:00.250
<i>Explosion reported.
Wabash and...</i>

02:00.250 --> 02:01.904
That's Jewelers Row,
isn't it?

02:20.531 --> 02:23.012
- Hey, let's move it!
- Let's go!

02:23.012 --> 02:25.188
Move back! It's not safe!

02:25.188 --> 02:26.929
Hey, let's go! Move it back!

02:26.929 --> 02:28.409
What are you people doing?

02:28.409 --> 02:29.845
What the hell?
Come on. Get up.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.589
Come on, move it!

02:37.722 --> 02:38.810
Capp, Tony!

02:38.810 --> 02:40.290
Get these people
the hell out of here!

02:40.290 --> 02:42.205
Let's move!
- Across the street, let's go!

02:44.294 --> 02:46.035
Get up! Leave it!

02:55.784 --> 02:58.874
Looks like the
place was bombed.

02:58.874 --> 03:01.006
Looks like there was
an explosion deep inside.

03:01.006 --> 03:03.095
Doesn't look like it moved up
to the second floor.

03:03.095 --> 03:07.317
Well, store wasn't open,
so that's a good sign.

03:07.317 --> 03:09.667
Let's get a primary search
down here,

03:09.667 --> 03:12.235
send some guys up
to evacuate upstairs.

03:12.235 --> 03:15.325
Hey, Herrmann, 51,
let's get a hose line inside!

03:15.325 --> 03:17.066
All right, working on it!

03:17.066 --> 03:19.590
All right, Bruce!
Mask up! We're going in!

03:19.590 --> 03:21.288
- Gallo, you're with me!
- Yep.

03:21.288 --> 03:23.812
Mouch, Carver, get upstairs.
Clear the rest of the building.

03:23.812 --> 03:25.814
- On it, Lieutenant.
- Copy, copy!

03:31.428 --> 03:32.951
Let's go.

03:32.951 --> 03:34.910
Hey, drop that stuff
and move back now.

03:34.910 --> 03:36.564
That's an order.
- Let's move!

03:41.569 --> 03:42.831
Truck, left side!

03:44.485 --> 03:46.269
Gallo, this way!

03:46.269 --> 03:47.792
Cruz, on my end!

03:47.792 --> 03:49.664
Fire department, call out!

03:53.842 --> 03:55.496
It's cooking in there!

04:05.723 --> 04:08.683
Fire department! Call out!

04:10.859 --> 04:12.687
Fire department, call out!

04:21.435 --> 04:23.263
Looks like the origin
of the blast right here!

04:27.267 --> 04:29.312
Cruz! Gimme a hand with this!

04:31.314 --> 04:32.272
Copy!

04:40.367 --> 04:42.107
Cruz!

04:43.848 --> 04:45.807
Help!

04:45.807 --> 04:47.678
One male victim, coming out!

04:47.678 --> 04:49.027
Let's get him up!

04:54.642 --> 04:57.384
One in the deck, right here!

04:57.384 --> 04:58.428
Whoa!

05:09.918 --> 05:10.919
What's your name?

05:10.919 --> 05:12.834
I'm Sylvie.

05:12.834 --> 05:14.662
Gene.

05:14.662 --> 05:17.360
Found him in the back near
where the blast was centered.

05:17.360 --> 05:19.449
Seriously?
You're one lucky man.

05:19.449 --> 05:21.625
The security door
protected him from most of it.

05:21.625 --> 05:23.540
Oh.

05:23.540 --> 05:25.237
What happened?

05:25.237 --> 05:28.197
Your ultrasonic
cleaning tank blew up.

05:28.197 --> 05:29.546
But--but--

05:29.546 --> 05:30.765
I wasn't even using it!

05:30.765 --> 05:32.462
Okay, okay. Just relax.

05:32.462 --> 05:34.072
We're gonna get you
to the hospital

05:34.072 --> 05:35.204
and get those burns
taken care of.

05:35.204 --> 05:37.032
Okay?
- Yeah, okay.

05:37.032 --> 05:39.339
Here you go.

05:39.339 --> 05:42.124
Squad 3 to 51,
Herrmann, progress report.

05:42.124 --> 05:45.170
We're ready to knock down
the fire!

05:51.438 --> 05:52.352
Thank you.

06:00.142 --> 06:02.274
We're gonna need
this area cordoned off--

06:02.274 --> 06:04.146
the entire debris field.
- Are you kidding me?

06:04.146 --> 06:07.715
We're finding bits of glass
halfway to Willis Tower.

06:07.715 --> 06:09.020
What do you want me
to tell you?

06:09.020 --> 06:10.587
Any clues to how this started

06:10.587 --> 06:12.676
would have been blown out the
window with everything else.

06:12.676 --> 06:14.939
OFI's gonna want to collect it.

06:14.939 --> 06:18.160
Oh, my God, oh, my God.
Look at this.

06:18.160 --> 06:19.770
- Hey, hey-oh!
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!

06:19.770 --> 06:21.990
Sir, sir!
- That's my store!

06:21.990 --> 06:24.079
I understand, but it's
an active fire scene.

06:24.079 --> 06:26.473
- What happened?
- There was an explosion.

06:26.473 --> 06:29.432
And an employee of yours,
an older guy,

06:29.432 --> 06:32.043
was transported to Chicago Med
with second-degree burns.

06:32.043 --> 06:34.437
But those windows
were full of jewelry.

06:34.437 --> 06:37.048
Looters got here
before we could.

06:37.048 --> 06:39.050
No. No, come on.

06:43.141 --> 06:45.317
Hey--hey, enough
with the water already!

06:45.317 --> 06:47.798
Fine, if you don't mind
the fire reigniting!

06:47.798 --> 06:49.931
Officer, I want these
firefighters out of my store!

06:49.931 --> 06:51.323
They're trampling
all over the place.

06:51.323 --> 06:52.977
All right.
Take a breath, sir.

06:52.977 --> 06:54.892
Let's go.
- You have to stop them.

06:54.892 --> 06:56.067
I'm sorry,
there's nothing I can do.

06:56.067 --> 06:59.549
I tell ya, no good deed.

07:10.908 --> 07:11.866
Hey, look who's here!

07:11.866 --> 07:13.607
Hi, guys!

07:13.607 --> 07:14.956
- Hey, Chloe.
- Hey.

07:14.956 --> 07:16.566
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

07:16.566 --> 07:18.481
I thought you had a busy day.
- Yeah, I--I do.

07:18.481 --> 07:20.440
You--you got a second?

07:20.440 --> 07:22.354
Yeah, yeah, sure.

07:22.354 --> 07:24.226
Hey, is everything okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

07:25.880 --> 07:29.405
Okay, so I talked to Eddie
this morning from the foster--

07:29.405 --> 07:30.928
Yeah, yeah, Eddie,
sure, yeah.

07:30.928 --> 07:32.669
You remember that endless
list of obstacles standing

07:32.669 --> 07:34.497
in our way of being able to--
- Yeah, yeah.

07:34.497 --> 07:36.891
Well, Eddie has been on it
like a dog with a bone.

07:36.891 --> 07:38.501
Great.

07:38.501 --> 07:39.981
And he's been working
with some contacts in Honduras,

07:39.981 --> 07:42.549
and they finally got a hold
of Javi's uncle, Roberto.

07:42.549 --> 07:44.028
Okay.

07:44.028 --> 07:45.377
Roberto was able to
provide documentation

07:45.377 --> 07:47.075
showing that Javi's mom
is deceased

07:47.075 --> 07:48.859
and his dad was
never in the picture.

07:48.859 --> 07:50.382
He has no interest
in parenting,

07:50.382 --> 07:52.515
and he has relinquished
his rights to guardianship.

07:52.515 --> 07:53.995
Which means?

07:53.995 --> 07:55.692
We can proceed with our
application to adoption him.

07:55.692 --> 07:57.738
Oh!

08:03.178 --> 08:04.919
Some of the jewels I saw
looked like they'd

08:04.919 --> 08:06.529
pay off my mortgage.
- Yeah.

08:06.529 --> 08:09.271
And the guy is screaming at us
like it's our fault somehow.

08:09.271 --> 08:12.013
We saved half of his store.

08:12.013 --> 08:15.277
Hey, man. What's up?

08:15.277 --> 08:17.932
Yeah, I figured I'd hit up
F&T Lounge tomorrow night.

08:20.021 --> 08:22.066
Sounds good. See you.

08:24.765 --> 08:25.896
What?

08:25.896 --> 08:26.984
We couldn't help
but overhear.

08:26.984 --> 08:29.900
What's F&T Lounge?

08:29.900 --> 08:31.467
Bar in Hyde Park.

08:32.424 --> 08:35.297
What kind of place?
Like, what's the vibe?

08:35.297 --> 08:37.473
Loud, rowdy, and fun.

08:37.473 --> 08:39.736
Doesn't really get going
till late.

08:39.736 --> 08:41.782
No, thank you.

08:41.782 --> 08:43.044
I'll take Molly's any day.

08:43.044 --> 08:44.567
Amen.

08:44.567 --> 08:46.351
Oh, did you
apologize to Carver

08:46.351 --> 08:48.092
for going through his locker?

08:48.092 --> 08:49.267
Damn, Brett!

08:52.009 --> 08:53.924
I wasn't going through it.

08:53.924 --> 08:55.796
Yeah, you left it open,
and I just--

08:55.796 --> 08:57.275
I glanced inside.

08:58.494 --> 08:59.930
I guess if my deodorant
is missing,

08:59.930 --> 09:01.758
I'll know who
to talk to about it.

09:05.457 --> 09:07.634
Honesty is the best policy,
especially amongst housemates.

09:07.634 --> 09:10.506
Glad I didn't sit next
to you in high school.

09:12.377 --> 09:13.335
Narc.

09:21.125 --> 09:22.126
Severide.

09:22.126 --> 09:23.432
Van Meter.

09:25.042 --> 09:26.957
She's not with me.

09:26.957 --> 09:29.090
Who's not?

09:29.090 --> 09:30.787
Seager.

09:30.787 --> 09:33.268
She's at a fire science
conference in Baltimore.

09:33.268 --> 09:35.444
I guess she didn't think
I was shorthanded enough.

09:35.444 --> 09:36.793
You take a look
at the jewelry store?

09:36.793 --> 09:38.403
Yeah, only a quick one.

09:38.403 --> 09:41.711
For now, I just sealed it up,
posted a squad car outside.

09:41.711 --> 09:43.147
Any gut instincts?

09:43.147 --> 09:44.714
It looks like
the blast was centered

09:44.714 --> 09:48.500
in the industrial
ultrasonic cleaning tank.

09:48.500 --> 09:51.460
Most kinds, you can't
use a flammable solvent

09:51.460 --> 09:54.463
or the high voltage
ignites the vapors,

09:54.463 --> 09:56.073
and it causes an explosion.

09:56.073 --> 09:58.206
That could be
what happened here.

09:58.206 --> 09:59.642
Yeah, maybe.

09:59.642 --> 10:01.426
I don't know.
I don't think it's that simple.

10:06.562 --> 10:09.347
That's high-grade
laminated security glass.

10:10.827 --> 10:12.524
A tank full of solvent might
put on a real

10:12.524 --> 10:14.483
fireworks display,
but it's a low-pressure

10:14.483 --> 10:16.528
deflagration-type explosion.

10:16.528 --> 10:18.661
To shatter half a dozen sheets
of this stuff,

10:18.661 --> 10:20.228
that takes
a full-on detonation.

10:20.228 --> 10:22.491
Supersonic shockwave.

10:24.188 --> 10:25.102
So what are you thinking?

10:25.102 --> 10:26.843
I don't know, but--

10:26.843 --> 10:28.497
I mean, a solvent might
have kicked off the blast,

10:28.497 --> 10:30.238
but it had to be a chain
reaction with some kind

10:30.238 --> 10:33.241
of high explosive device.

10:33.241 --> 10:34.677
Yeah, this wasn't somebody
misreading the label

10:34.677 --> 10:36.374
on a bottle
of cleaning solution.

10:37.854 --> 10:39.508
This blast was intentional.

10:45.862 --> 10:47.995
So you were the only one
in the store at the time.

10:47.995 --> 10:49.518
That's right.

10:49.518 --> 10:51.781
I usually come in about an hour
before the retail staff.

10:51.781 --> 10:53.087
Are you the store manager?

10:55.306 --> 10:56.873
I'm the jewelry maker.

10:56.873 --> 11:00.442
I craft new pieces,
restore old ones.

11:00.442 --> 11:02.400
Engagement rings
are my specialty.

11:02.400 --> 11:04.881
And you clean these pieces
in an ultrasonic tank?

11:06.274 --> 11:08.232
You said on the scene
that you weren't

11:08.232 --> 11:10.147
using the tank this morning?
- That's right.

11:10.147 --> 11:13.542
But you got me worrying.
Maybe I left it on last night?

11:13.542 --> 11:15.544
I don't think I did.

11:15.544 --> 11:16.806
Oh, I hope I didn't.

11:16.806 --> 11:17.851
But it's been hectic
around the shop,

11:17.851 --> 11:21.637
so maybe I--I got distracted.

11:21.637 --> 11:23.160
Why has it been so hectic?

11:23.160 --> 11:24.771
Mr. Demarco brought in
a big shipment

11:24.771 --> 11:26.424
of diamonds last week--

11:26.424 --> 11:28.122
the biggest I've ever seen,

11:28.122 --> 11:30.341
and I've been with the store
ten years.

11:30.341 --> 11:32.822
It's up to me to sort them,
grade them, document them

11:32.822 --> 11:35.259
for the insurance company.

11:35.259 --> 11:37.261
Did you find the stones?
- The diamonds?

11:37.261 --> 11:40.221
No, but the safe is intact.

11:40.221 --> 11:42.832
They weren't in the safe.

11:42.832 --> 11:44.791
First thing every morning,
I pull out the gem trays

11:44.791 --> 11:46.575
and lay them out
on the workbench.

11:46.575 --> 11:48.316
That's standard procedure?

11:48.316 --> 11:49.447
Just leave them out all day?

11:49.447 --> 11:52.668
The workshop's pretty secure.

11:52.668 --> 11:54.104
At least, it used to be.

11:54.104 --> 11:56.411
So you just left them,
the diamonds, in the trays.

11:56.411 --> 11:57.717
Yes, sir.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.197
Well, I didn't lift
the lids to check,

12:00.197 --> 12:02.939
but they were in there
last night when I left.

12:02.939 --> 12:04.549
Were you the last one out?

12:04.549 --> 12:07.204
Uh, no, that would be
Mr. Demarco.

12:15.778 --> 12:18.041
Some pretty dodgy timing, right?

12:18.041 --> 12:19.782
Big shipment
of diamonds arrives

12:19.782 --> 12:21.784
right before
a mysterious explosion

12:21.784 --> 12:23.873
sends jewels flying
onto Wabash?

12:23.873 --> 12:26.920
Yeah, we'd better look
into the store owner.

12:26.920 --> 12:28.269
When does Seager get back?

12:28.269 --> 12:29.879
Not soon enough.

12:29.879 --> 12:31.751
Can you step in on this one?

12:31.751 --> 12:33.143
Yeah, you bet.

12:39.106 --> 12:41.978
Hey!
Herrmann, you got a sec?

12:41.978 --> 12:43.850
Who drinks
the last cup of coffee

12:43.850 --> 12:45.895
without brewing a fresh pot?

12:45.895 --> 12:47.114
What kind of human?

12:47.114 --> 12:48.811
- My money's on Capp.
- Yeah.

12:48.811 --> 12:50.552
Hey.

12:50.552 --> 12:52.293
What's all that?

12:52.293 --> 12:54.034
Adoption application.

12:54.034 --> 12:56.036
For--

12:56.036 --> 12:58.255
I thought that was
a whole tangled mess.

12:58.255 --> 12:59.648
It just untangled.

12:59.648 --> 13:01.041
Oh!

13:01.041 --> 13:02.825
Fantastic!
- Yeah, t is.

13:02.825 --> 13:04.000
It is, it is.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.697
I, uh--I just can't
believe how much

13:05.697 --> 13:06.916
information I have to provide.

13:06.916 --> 13:09.745
But I need a big favor.

13:09.745 --> 13:10.877
Anything.

13:13.009 --> 13:14.315
Will you write me
a character reference?

13:19.624 --> 13:21.409
Are you sure
that I'm your guy?

13:21.409 --> 13:27.110
Um, writing isn't exactly
my strong suit, Joe.

13:27.110 --> 13:28.155
Who cares?

13:30.157 --> 13:32.681
Listen, you're the one
that convinced me

13:32.681 --> 13:34.378
that I would love
being a father.

13:36.467 --> 13:39.688
And you were right.

13:39.688 --> 13:43.257
And you're the best
that I know.

13:49.263 --> 13:52.309
A freak explosion right after
this big shipment

13:52.309 --> 13:53.484
of diamonds gets insured.

13:53.484 --> 13:54.790
Tell me that doesn't smell
like a scam.

13:54.790 --> 13:56.313
- No doubt.
- Yeah.

13:56.313 --> 13:57.793
What's your plan?

13:57.793 --> 13:59.447
Start by questioning Demarco,
then I'll head over

13:59.447 --> 14:02.189
to the jewelry store
and comb the scene.

14:04.191 --> 14:07.803
"I'll head over,"
not "we'll"?

14:07.803 --> 14:09.370
Uh, Seager's out of town,

14:09.370 --> 14:11.502
so I'm gonna
tackle this one solo.

14:11.502 --> 14:12.677
Oh.

14:12.677 --> 14:16.464
Well, I can give you a hand.

14:16.464 --> 14:17.465
You?

14:17.465 --> 14:19.249
Yeah.

14:19.249 --> 14:20.772
I'm really good
at this kind of thing.

14:20.772 --> 14:22.905
At fire investigations?

14:22.905 --> 14:26.300
Yeah. Sure.

14:26.300 --> 14:28.693
All right, well,
I guess it couldn't hurt

14:28.693 --> 14:30.173
to have a second set of eyes.

14:30.173 --> 14:32.436
Really?

14:32.436 --> 14:34.656
This is gonna be great.

14:34.656 --> 14:36.092
Sorry.

14:36.092 --> 14:37.920
Boden wants to see everyone
in the briefing room.

14:44.971 --> 14:46.102
What's going on?

14:48.235 --> 14:50.715
The owner of the jewelry
store, Robert Demarco.

14:50.715 --> 14:53.501
He's coming after the CFD
with his lawyers.

14:53.501 --> 14:55.372
What the hell for?

14:55.372 --> 14:57.287
Gross negligence,
dereliction of duty.

14:59.376 --> 15:02.249
He claims, between the
looters we failed to stop

15:02.249 --> 15:05.643
and our bull-in-a-china-shop
actions at the scene,

15:05.643 --> 15:08.951
that we are responsible
for the loss of jewels.

15:08.951 --> 15:10.692
Potentially totaling
in the millions.

15:10.692 --> 15:11.911
Oh, what?

15:11.911 --> 15:13.695
That's a bunch of BS, Chief!

15:13.695 --> 15:16.524
Chief, we drove those
looters off the best we could.

15:16.524 --> 15:17.655
We had a fire to deal with.

15:17.655 --> 15:19.005
The guy's a cementhead,
Chief!

15:19.005 --> 15:20.963
He didn't want us
putting water in a fire!

15:20.963 --> 15:22.965
Look, I'm confident you all
did great work out there,

15:22.965 --> 15:25.489
but this nonsense doesn't
go away on its own.

15:25.489 --> 15:28.492
So I need detailed statements
from each one of you.

15:28.492 --> 15:30.190
Yeah, you got it, Chief.

15:30.190 --> 15:33.062
He's just trying to muddy the
waters with this legal threat.

15:33.062 --> 15:34.934
Yeah, well,
I hope you're right.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.545
Because you are a target
of this lawsuit.

15:37.545 --> 15:39.895
No missteps while you're
moonlighting for OFI.

15:42.071 --> 15:44.900
<i>Ambo 61, person down,
Hermitage and 35th Street.</i>

15:55.998 --> 15:57.521
Does anyone know
what happened?

15:57.521 --> 15:59.001
I was walking a block
or so behind him

15:59.001 --> 16:00.524
when I saw him go down.

16:00.524 --> 16:01.569
No idea why.

16:01.569 --> 16:03.179
All right,
let's C-collar him.

16:03.179 --> 16:04.441
Yep.

16:10.491 --> 16:11.492
Does anyone know this man?

16:11.492 --> 16:12.754
Only by sight.

16:12.754 --> 16:13.929
He lives around here.

16:13.929 --> 16:16.149
Always says hello.
A real sweetie.

16:37.735 --> 16:39.999
BP is 110.
He's unresponsive.

16:45.917 --> 16:48.572
- Let's get him to Med.
- Yeah.

16:48.572 --> 16:49.834
I hope he's okay.

16:49.834 --> 16:52.359
One, two, three.

16:58.887 --> 17:00.236
Thank you.

17:11.769 --> 17:13.467
What happened?

17:13.467 --> 17:15.338
You had a fall
and hurt your head.

17:15.338 --> 17:17.036
Can you tell me your name, sir?

17:17.036 --> 17:18.646
I'm in an ambulance!

17:18.646 --> 17:21.257
Yeah, we're getting you
to Chicago Med so we can get--

17:21.257 --> 17:22.519
whoa, whoa, wait.
Sir, your neck or back--

17:22.519 --> 17:24.086
I don't need to go
to the hospital.

17:24.086 --> 17:25.827
Pull over and let me out.
- Okay, you're all right.

17:25.827 --> 17:28.003
Just stay calm for me, okay?
We're here to help you, okay?

17:28.003 --> 17:30.179
I can't be here!
Pull this thing over!

17:30.179 --> 17:31.354
You good, Violet?

17:31.354 --> 17:32.964
No, for your safety,
we can't do that.

17:32.964 --> 17:34.270
Now, I need to ask you
a few questions,

17:34.270 --> 17:36.881
so I know that you're okay.

17:36.881 --> 17:38.057
Wait!

17:49.285 --> 17:51.113
- What happened?
- He just jumped.

17:51.113 --> 17:52.332
Was he violent?

17:52.332 --> 17:53.550
No, honestly,
he just seemed scared.

17:53.550 --> 17:54.943
But I'm not sure he even
knows where he is.

17:54.943 --> 17:56.118
All right, well,
I'll over here.

17:56.118 --> 17:57.076
You want to check
the next street?

17:57.076 --> 17:58.077
Yeah, I got it.

18:06.998 --> 18:08.652
Hello?

18:08.652 --> 18:11.090
Look, we're not gonna take you
anywhere you don't want to go!

18:11.090 --> 18:13.135
We just want to
make sure you're okay!

18:21.404 --> 18:22.492
It fell off.

18:22.492 --> 18:23.972
That's okay.

18:23.972 --> 18:25.974
I can fix it.

18:25.974 --> 18:27.802
Hey, I found our friend.
He's just inside the alley.

18:27.802 --> 18:29.978
Bring the jump bag.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

18:29.978 --> 18:31.806
Um, here.

18:31.806 --> 18:32.763
Have a seat.

18:32.763 --> 18:34.069
Let me take a look at that cut.

18:37.725 --> 18:39.379
Can I ask your name?

18:39.379 --> 18:41.207
You must think I'm crazy.

18:41.207 --> 18:42.817
I don't know about that.

18:42.817 --> 18:44.471
You're obviously not
a fan of my driving.

18:46.299 --> 18:48.388
I'm Vince.

18:48.388 --> 18:50.912
Let's get that cleaned up
and get a new bandage on it.

18:53.088 --> 18:55.525
Vince, this is Violet.
I'm Sylvie.

18:55.525 --> 18:56.831
Oh, what happened there,
Vince?

18:56.831 --> 18:58.789
You could've really
hurt yourself.

18:58.789 --> 19:02.489
I had a seizure
about a month ago.

19:02.489 --> 19:04.534
I woke up in an ambulance
like that,

19:04.534 --> 19:06.101
got brought to the hospital
where they ran

19:06.101 --> 19:08.016
a bunch of tests.

19:08.016 --> 19:12.847
$20,000 later--
a chunk of it, the ride--

19:12.847 --> 19:14.196
I was diagnosed
with an infection

19:14.196 --> 19:16.285
that had traveled to my brain.

19:16.285 --> 19:17.939
Caused a cyst there.

19:20.985 --> 19:23.597
Yeah, it sounds like
a parasitic infection.

19:23.597 --> 19:26.295
I wish I could say
those numbers surprise me.

19:26.295 --> 19:28.210
No insurance to help?

19:28.210 --> 19:29.820
I'm between jobs.

19:29.820 --> 19:32.388
Still not close
to paying it off.

19:32.388 --> 19:37.088
And the medication they
prescribed is 90 bucks a pill.

19:37.088 --> 19:38.438
Who can afford that?

19:38.438 --> 19:39.743
Yeah, but with those seizures
you're having,

19:39.743 --> 19:41.615
they won't go away
without medication.

19:41.615 --> 19:43.617
They'll just keep
getting worse.

19:49.927 --> 19:51.842
You jumped out of the
right ambulance today, Vince.

19:53.801 --> 19:55.411
'Cause I run a
paramedicine program,

19:55.411 --> 19:57.413
and a spot just opened up.

19:57.413 --> 19:58.762
If I enroll you today,

19:58.762 --> 20:00.329
your medication
will be covered.

20:00.329 --> 20:02.113
What's the catch?

20:02.113 --> 20:03.941
You just have to get
a follow-up with a doctor,

20:03.941 --> 20:06.683
and you have to let me
and my paramedicine ambulance

20:06.683 --> 20:09.338
drive you there--
without jumping out,

20:09.338 --> 20:10.687
no matter how hard a left
I take.

20:15.475 --> 20:17.477
I think I can do that.

20:23.004 --> 20:25.049
I understand how it looks,
ma'am,

20:25.049 --> 20:26.573
but when you read
these statements,

20:26.573 --> 20:28.183
you'll see that my people
did top-notch work out there.

20:28.183 --> 20:29.706
They did nothing wrong.

20:29.706 --> 20:32.231
Tell her Demarco is under
investigation, all right?

20:32.231 --> 20:34.581
The CFD needs to be
on the offensive here.

20:36.452 --> 20:37.714
Yes, ma'am.

20:37.714 --> 20:39.542
I will call him right now.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.502
Kylie.

20:42.502 --> 20:43.590
Put me through to the
commissioner's office.

20:43.590 --> 20:45.853
Will you, please?

20:45.853 --> 20:49.204
Chief, we have a solid
working theory here.

20:49.204 --> 20:52.033
Robert Demarco bought this
big shipment of diamonds, okay?

20:52.033 --> 20:54.818
He stages a big explosion
to fake their disappearance

20:54.818 --> 20:56.646
to bilk the insurance company.

20:56.646 --> 20:58.169
And he didn't give a damn
if he killed

20:58.169 --> 21:00.563
a faithful employee
in the process.

21:00.563 --> 21:02.173
This lawsuit
is a smokescreen.

21:02.173 --> 21:04.654
He's just a guy playing
the part of someone

21:04.654 --> 21:07.222
who lost everything.

21:07.222 --> 21:09.572
Line two, Chief.

21:09.572 --> 21:11.182
Look.

21:11.182 --> 21:13.184
I can't go accusing
a man of a crime

21:13.184 --> 21:15.317
without the evidence
to back it up.

21:17.188 --> 21:18.233
So go get the evidence.

21:19.669 --> 21:21.845
That is the plan.

21:24.718 --> 21:26.981
Commissioner, Wallace Boden.

21:26.981 --> 21:29.331
Man, I hope Boden
can keep this lawsuit

21:29.331 --> 21:30.767
from barreling forward.

21:30.767 --> 21:32.682
It sounds like it could be bad
for all our lieutenants.

21:32.682 --> 21:34.031
I was thinking
the same thing,

21:34.031 --> 21:36.730
but Severide is on the case,
and that's good.

21:42.213 --> 21:47.044
You know, we expect Carver
to come to us at Molly's,

21:47.044 --> 21:49.917
but maybe we should
make a gesture,

21:49.917 --> 21:51.397
go where he hangs out.

21:51.397 --> 21:52.789
I don't like that plan.

21:52.789 --> 21:55.226
I have a regular haunt
for a reason.

21:55.226 --> 21:57.620
I know just the level
of eejits I'll be dealing with.

21:57.620 --> 22:00.797
And let's not forget, you
partly own the place, Mouch.

22:00.797 --> 22:01.929
But I agree with him.

22:01.929 --> 22:03.191
It's not like
Carver invited us.

22:03.191 --> 22:06.063
Guys, come on. Look at us.
We eat together.

22:06.063 --> 22:07.456
We hang out
at Molly's together.

22:07.456 --> 22:09.023
We finish each
other's sentences.

22:09.023 --> 22:10.677
No wonder Carver feels
like odd man out.

22:10.677 --> 22:12.679
I have never in my life

22:12.679 --> 22:15.029
finished one of your sentences.

22:15.029 --> 22:17.031
My point is,
Carver might feel like

22:17.031 --> 22:19.338
we don't really
want him around.

22:19.338 --> 22:21.209
And how much could it hurt
to make the effort?

22:22.993 --> 22:25.039
Let's go to F&T lounge tonight.

22:29.260 --> 22:30.349
<i>Hola, familia!</i>

22:30.349 --> 22:31.393
Hey!

22:31.393 --> 22:32.742
Otis just crashed.

22:32.742 --> 22:34.440
Oh, sorry.

22:34.440 --> 22:35.615
How was your shift?

22:35.615 --> 22:37.443
A little bananas.

22:37.443 --> 22:40.097
We had to write all of these
statements for Boden,

22:40.097 --> 22:43.710
so I didn't get to finish
my part of the application.

22:51.718 --> 22:53.154
Look at this.

22:58.855 --> 23:01.467
Hi, baby.
- Hi.

23:01.467 --> 23:03.425
What were the statements for?

23:03.425 --> 23:06.254
Oh, boring stuff.

23:06.254 --> 23:07.560
How's everything here?

23:07.560 --> 23:08.648
We're good.

23:12.869 --> 23:14.915
Javi's got a question for you.

23:14.915 --> 23:17.134
Oh. Give me, papi.

23:19.180 --> 23:20.834
Go ahead.

23:24.359 --> 23:27.188
Is it okay if--

23:31.105 --> 23:33.194
Can I start calling you Dad?

23:40.201 --> 23:41.942
Yeah, Javi.

23:43.857 --> 23:46.120
Yeah, you sure can.

24:01.004 --> 24:02.658
Hey, remember
what Boden said?

24:02.658 --> 24:04.660
Hey, no missteps.

24:04.660 --> 24:07.402
We're not here to argue or
accuse him of anything, okay?

24:07.402 --> 24:08.664
We're just here
to gather information.

24:08.664 --> 24:10.449
I gotcha.

24:17.978 --> 24:19.370
Hey, Mr. Demarco.

24:21.416 --> 24:23.462
I'm not sure
if you remember us.

24:23.462 --> 24:24.811
Lieutenant Kelly Severide.

24:24.811 --> 24:26.377
This is Lieutenant Stella Kidd,
with the CFD.

24:26.377 --> 24:27.857
Oh, yeah,
you're the firefighters

24:27.857 --> 24:29.206
who made a mess of my store.

24:29.206 --> 24:32.514
You mean, saved it
from total destruction?

24:32.514 --> 24:34.603
Your oafs came trampling
through my shop

24:34.603 --> 24:37.476
and flushed who knows how many
gems into the Chicago River.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.521
Mr. Demarco, we're not
here to argue with you.

24:39.521 --> 24:42.219
We were detailed by the
Office of Fire Investigation.

24:42.219 --> 24:44.526
We just have a few questions.
- Fine.

24:44.526 --> 24:47.355
Do you have any idea
what caused the explosion?

24:47.355 --> 24:48.399
Isn't that your job?

24:50.401 --> 24:51.968
We think it was an
ultrasonic cleaner.

24:51.968 --> 24:54.231
Did you notice anything
unusual about it?

24:54.231 --> 24:55.972
When was the last time
you used it?

24:55.972 --> 25:00.411
I don't know.
Two, maybe three times a week?

25:00.411 --> 25:02.413
Okay, I understand you were
the last person in the store

25:02.413 --> 25:04.111
the evening before
the explosion.

25:04.111 --> 25:06.461
You understand that?
What does that mean?

25:06.461 --> 25:08.724
Were you the last person
in the store?

25:08.724 --> 25:09.899
I think maybe
you should address

25:09.899 --> 25:11.335
these questions to my lawyer.

25:11.335 --> 25:12.772
Sir, we're just--

25:12.772 --> 25:14.861
No, I don't appreciate
your veiled accusations.

25:14.861 --> 25:16.123
Goodbye now.

25:16.123 --> 25:18.168
What are you so scared of,
Mr. Demarco?

25:18.168 --> 25:20.780
Look, I had nothing to do
with that explosion, okay?

25:20.780 --> 25:21.955
I was at the dentist's office

25:21.955 --> 25:23.086
halfway across town
when it happened--

25:23.086 --> 25:24.566
Dr. Bigelow,
if you care to check.

25:24.566 --> 25:26.394
Okay. Dr. Bigelow.

25:26.394 --> 25:28.483
I get what's going on here.
This is retaliation.

25:28.483 --> 25:29.832
You're trying to pin
this whole thing on me

25:29.832 --> 25:31.268
because of my lawsuit.

25:31.268 --> 25:33.967
Well, let's add harassment
to my list of complaints.

25:33.967 --> 25:35.229
Get off my property.

25:57.730 --> 25:59.558
Pieces of loose jewelry everywhere,

25:59.558 --> 26:02.778
but no loose stones.

26:02.778 --> 26:06.652
What are the odds that
every single one of them

26:06.652 --> 26:09.872
was looted or washed away?

26:09.872 --> 26:11.308
Zero.

26:15.312 --> 26:17.837
Demarco was pretty worked up.

26:17.837 --> 26:19.012
I mean, genuinely.

26:19.012 --> 26:20.709
Because he knows
that we're onto him.

26:20.709 --> 26:25.409
And I know how he
rigged this to blow.

26:25.409 --> 26:27.063
Yeah, I found
the shards of steel

26:27.063 --> 26:30.806
from a cylinder that
blasted through this case.

26:30.806 --> 26:34.593
I think it came from that
acetylene rig over there.

26:36.246 --> 26:37.465
So what does
this all add up to?

26:37.465 --> 26:40.250
Well, he put the cylinder
inside the tank.

26:40.250 --> 26:42.296
Then he has
a flammable solvent,

26:42.296 --> 26:43.689
and he turns the machine on.

26:43.689 --> 26:47.431
It vaporizes the solvent,
which gets pressurized,

26:47.431 --> 26:48.998
ignites the vapor.

26:48.998 --> 26:50.783
It explodes. Boom.

26:50.783 --> 26:54.395
I mean, it's crude,
but it's an effective bomb.

26:55.875 --> 26:57.398
Nice work.

26:57.398 --> 27:02.316
Well, problem is, Demarco had
to turn the machine on,

27:02.316 --> 27:04.274
drive all the way
across town to the dentist

27:04.274 --> 27:05.972
to establish an alibi.

27:05.972 --> 27:07.800
We have to prove that
he had enough time

27:07.800 --> 27:10.672
to set off that chain reaction.

27:10.672 --> 27:12.892
What kind of solvent
would he use?

27:12.892 --> 27:16.373
How much vapor is needed
in order to explode?

27:16.373 --> 27:19.463
The tensile strength
of the cylinder?

27:26.862 --> 27:27.994
Hey.

27:37.656 --> 27:39.875
This is something.

27:39.875 --> 27:42.051
It looks like
one of those cheap timers

27:42.051 --> 27:45.794
that you plug a lamp into
when you go out of town

27:45.794 --> 27:48.014
so your lights go on and off.

27:48.014 --> 27:51.104
So maybe this is
what gave him enough time

27:51.104 --> 27:52.975
to go to Dr. Bigelow's office.

28:00.983 --> 28:02.942
I think it was destroyed
in the blast.

28:02.942 --> 28:04.987
Look for other pieces.
- Yeah.

28:16.346 --> 28:17.565
Kelly!

28:21.438 --> 28:24.137
Heh. Look at you.

28:34.103 --> 28:35.452
Look at that.

28:35.452 --> 28:37.759
Who needs Seager, anyway?

28:41.110 --> 28:42.982
Too many people!

28:42.982 --> 28:45.549
But at least it's not
a hipster joint!

28:45.549 --> 28:47.116
- What?
- Did you say something?

28:47.116 --> 28:48.814
I said, too many people!

28:48.814 --> 28:51.425
Yeah! Let's find Carver!

28:54.080 --> 28:55.037
Excuse me!

28:56.822 --> 28:58.737
Oh, over there,
at the end of the bar!

29:01.435 --> 29:03.742
Wait, he's with someone!

29:03.742 --> 29:06.614
Oh, no, I think we're
crashing his date!

29:06.614 --> 29:07.876
Let's get out of here!

29:07.876 --> 29:09.573
No, no, no,
we've come this far!

29:09.573 --> 29:11.010
Shouldn't we at least
get a beer?

29:12.881 --> 29:13.882
Hey!

29:19.148 --> 29:21.237
Excuse me.

29:21.237 --> 29:22.891
Sorry.

29:22.891 --> 29:24.806
What are you guys doing here?

29:24.806 --> 29:27.026
We thought we'd come to one
of your hangouts, you know?

29:27.026 --> 29:28.810
Make a gesture.

29:28.810 --> 29:31.508
Yeah, but you're on a date,
so we'll just have one beer

29:31.508 --> 29:33.075
and be on our way!
- I'm not on a date!

29:33.075 --> 29:35.774
Come over here
and meet my buddies!

29:35.774 --> 29:37.123
That's the second time
I've seen you talking

29:37.123 --> 29:38.211
to my girlfriend tonight.

29:43.956 --> 29:45.914
She didn't say a thing about
having a boyfriend, dude,

29:45.914 --> 29:49.265
so I think that's your problem,
not mine.

29:49.265 --> 29:50.963
- Whoa!
- Whoa, whoa!

29:59.710 --> 30:01.930
Well, this is certainly
one of the best-looking

30:01.930 --> 30:04.628
applications I've seen
in a long time.

30:04.628 --> 30:06.152
Chloe's a wizard
with paperwork.

30:06.152 --> 30:07.849
Upside of being
a perfectionist.

30:07.849 --> 30:09.982
And that's a great letter
from your friend, Christopher.

30:09.982 --> 30:11.810
He said some very
lovely things about you.

30:11.810 --> 30:13.724
Oh, yeah. He's a good liar.

30:13.724 --> 30:14.856
Uh, that was a joke.

30:14.856 --> 30:16.466
That's a--that's a bad joke.

30:16.466 --> 30:19.992
He's--he's a terrible liar, actually.

30:19.992 --> 30:23.212
I just have a few questions
I need to ask.

30:23.212 --> 30:25.388
Yeah, of course,
whatever you need.

30:25.388 --> 30:29.131
Joe, your brother, Leon--
tell me a little bit about him.

30:29.131 --> 30:30.829
- He's the best.
- Total sweetheart.

30:30.829 --> 30:34.484
Javi loves him.
- So he's around?

30:34.484 --> 30:35.834
He's part of the family?

30:35.834 --> 30:37.705
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Huge part.

30:37.705 --> 30:40.403
Absolutely. Uncle Leon.
- Yeah.

30:40.403 --> 30:41.752
Okay.

30:41.752 --> 30:45.147
Because Leon Cruz turned up
in a CPD database

30:45.147 --> 30:48.672
of individuals with known
gang affiliations.

30:48.672 --> 30:52.067
Uh, what?
No, that's a mistake.

30:52.067 --> 30:53.721
Okay. Good.

30:53.721 --> 30:58.508
So the Leon Cruz who lived at
3443 West Evergreen in 2012--

30:58.508 --> 31:00.032
that's not your brother?

31:00.032 --> 31:04.427
No, that's him, but--

31:04.427 --> 31:07.778
yeah, okay, uh, Leon

31:07.778 --> 31:11.913
was in a gang for a short time
when he was a kid.

31:11.913 --> 31:14.307
But I turned him around,
and I got him out of there.

31:14.307 --> 31:17.223
It was a few weeks, at most.

31:17.223 --> 31:21.836
The database has him listed
as active through 2014.

31:23.707 --> 31:25.361
That isn't--
that can't be right, is it?

31:25.361 --> 31:26.885
Okay, I see.

31:26.885 --> 31:31.193
That's because he did go
back into the gang, but--

31:31.193 --> 31:34.022
but it was to help the police
with an investigation.

31:34.022 --> 31:36.764
The cops pressured him into it.

31:38.070 --> 31:40.986
It sounds like
I'm making this up.

31:40.986 --> 31:43.553
Look, I promise
this is all true.

31:43.553 --> 31:45.686
- It is.
- Joe.

31:45.686 --> 31:48.341
This sounds like
a pretty complicated story.

31:48.341 --> 31:50.865
Yeah, but actually no,

31:50.865 --> 31:51.997
no, it's really very simple.

31:51.997 --> 31:55.217
Joe,
don't say any more about it.

31:59.047 --> 32:01.354
I'm going to give you back
your application.

32:03.356 --> 32:06.315
I want you to revise your
personal bio, and this time,

32:06.315 --> 32:09.318
include Leon's involvement
with the gang,

32:09.318 --> 32:11.712
with the cops, everything.

32:11.712 --> 32:15.020
Just take your time
and step it all out.

32:15.020 --> 32:16.935
- Okay.
- Okay. Okay.

32:16.935 --> 32:19.154
Because we can't approve
adoptive parents

32:19.154 --> 32:22.201
who might put Javi in close
contact with a gang member.

32:23.680 --> 32:24.812
Yeah, no, of course not.

32:33.038 --> 32:35.779
CPD pulled footage
off the PODs on Wabash.

32:35.779 --> 32:37.085
Those cameras cover
both the front

32:37.085 --> 32:39.000
and rear entrances
to Demarco Jewelers.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.915
They show
Robert Demarco leaving

32:40.915 --> 32:43.831
at 8:35 the night before,

32:43.831 --> 32:46.138
and he doesn't return until
well after the blast

32:46.138 --> 32:47.313
the next morning.

32:47.313 --> 32:48.749
He's the last one out
that night?

32:48.749 --> 32:50.098
Correct.

32:50.098 --> 32:51.970
And he was alone there
for a good half-hour.

32:51.970 --> 32:54.015
Plenty of time
to rig up the tank,

32:54.015 --> 32:56.104
clear out with the diamonds.

32:56.104 --> 32:58.454
And the timer delays
the blast until morning.

32:58.454 --> 33:01.109
Once Gene shows up,

33:01.109 --> 33:03.068
takes the trays out
of the safe.

33:03.068 --> 33:04.591
And Demarco doesn't
give a damn

33:04.591 --> 33:06.071
what happens to Gene
after that.

33:06.071 --> 33:07.463
Nice.

33:07.463 --> 33:09.291
- Boss, you got a sec?
- What'd you find, Dustin?

33:09.291 --> 33:11.511
Haven't been able to pull any
fingerprints off this thing,

33:11.511 --> 33:14.166
but once we reassembled it,
it's kind of interesting.

33:14.166 --> 33:15.515
The heat from the
fire fused most

33:15.515 --> 33:17.430
of the moving parts in place.

33:17.430 --> 33:18.822
And what does that tell us?

33:18.822 --> 33:21.303
We can see exactly
how it was programmed.

33:21.303 --> 33:23.349
Funny thing is, the way these
little colored tabs

33:23.349 --> 33:24.872
are positioned--

33:24.872 --> 33:26.221
timer couldn't have been set
more than five minutes

33:26.221 --> 33:28.397
before the blast.

33:28.397 --> 33:30.530
So there's no way
Demarco could have set

33:30.530 --> 33:32.358
the timer the night before.

33:33.837 --> 33:36.492
Who else entered
the store that morning?

33:36.492 --> 33:37.580
Only Gene.

33:37.580 --> 33:39.365
Gene, the victim?

33:41.062 --> 33:43.021
So he set the timer?

33:43.021 --> 33:45.153
And then hung around
for the explosion.

33:50.898 --> 33:55.076
So our only suspect is an
old jewelry maker, Gene.

33:55.076 --> 33:56.382
But it doesn't make any sense.

33:56.382 --> 33:58.906
Was he trying
to blow himself up?

33:58.906 --> 34:00.603
Don't need a timer for that.

34:00.603 --> 34:03.084
What was he trying
to accomplish?

34:03.084 --> 34:06.131
Maybe he's
a disgruntled worker.

34:06.131 --> 34:09.047
He was trying to destroy
his boss's store,

34:09.047 --> 34:10.309
take himself out
in the process.

34:10.309 --> 34:11.701
I don't know.

34:11.701 --> 34:13.225
He doesn't seem like
the angry type.

34:13.225 --> 34:15.270
Where'd you find him
in the store?

34:16.619 --> 34:19.753
In the office,
just off the workshop.

34:19.753 --> 34:23.583
I found him huddled up by
this big steel safe in there.

34:23.583 --> 34:25.759
Kind of like a bomb shelter?

34:25.759 --> 34:28.066
A man with a technical job,
familiar with tools--

34:28.066 --> 34:31.156
that isn't a stretch to think

34:31.156 --> 34:33.506
that he could cobble together
a makeshift bomb

34:33.506 --> 34:36.422
in a way that might make it
look like an accident.

34:36.422 --> 34:42.210
Bold move to stay inside,
but if he survives,

34:42.210 --> 34:45.213
ends up looking like
an innocent victim.

34:45.213 --> 34:47.563
And it's an
elaborate cover story

34:47.563 --> 34:49.130
for how the diamonds
went missing,

34:49.130 --> 34:52.046
when he had them all along.

34:52.046 --> 34:53.917
He couldn't have
had the diamonds.

34:53.917 --> 34:56.485
Demarco was the last one out
that night.

34:56.485 --> 34:59.445
And Gene was
the first one in the shop,

34:59.445 --> 35:03.144
and he never left that morning
until we carried him out.

35:03.144 --> 35:05.277
So where did they go?

35:05.277 --> 35:06.365
Could have had them
hidden on them.

35:09.194 --> 35:10.804
I'll call over to Med.

35:10.804 --> 35:12.980
But they would have cut his
clothes off and sedated him.

35:12.980 --> 35:15.243
So if there was a fortune
of diamonds on him,

35:15.243 --> 35:16.679
they would have found them.
- Right.

35:19.769 --> 35:21.641
I don't like this.

35:21.641 --> 35:27.777
I want answers,
not open-ended questions.

35:27.777 --> 35:29.518
Welcome to OFI.

35:32.913 --> 35:34.654
I can't believe Trudy
told you this kind of thing's

35:34.654 --> 35:37.222
happened with Carver before,
and you still let us go.

35:37.222 --> 35:40.050
Oh, no, no, no,
I am not taking the fall.

35:40.050 --> 35:41.661
This was all your idea.

35:41.661 --> 35:43.358
Stop shouting.

35:43.358 --> 35:46.013
Good morning.

35:46.013 --> 35:47.928
- Yeah.
- Sup?

35:55.370 --> 35:56.415
What time are you guys
meeting up

35:56.415 --> 35:57.894
at Molly's tomorrow night?

36:02.856 --> 36:04.771
Oh, uh--

36:04.771 --> 36:06.207
00?

36:06.207 --> 36:07.861
Cool. I'll be there.

36:10.255 --> 36:11.821
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:14.172 --> 36:15.521
Ow!

36:15.521 --> 36:17.305
Mmm! Breakfast smells good!

36:17.305 --> 36:19.220
Why hasn't anyone
made a bacon room spray?

36:19.220 --> 36:21.570
I'd fill my house with that.

36:21.570 --> 36:23.964
You three look like you've
been hanging out with Carver.

36:26.184 --> 36:27.446
Hey, you guys.

36:27.446 --> 36:29.230
Your victim from the
jewelry store fire,

36:29.230 --> 36:30.231
Gene--he just called.

36:30.231 --> 36:31.537
He's been released from Med,

36:31.537 --> 36:32.886
and he's coming by
to say thank you.

36:32.886 --> 36:34.235
Oh, that's sweet.

36:36.542 --> 36:38.021
That's not
why he's coming by.

36:56.605 --> 36:57.780
Is this how
the stretcher was set

36:57.780 --> 37:00.392
when you took Gene
to the hospital?

37:00.392 --> 37:02.263
Uh, yeah.
I had him sitting up a bit.

37:02.263 --> 37:04.091
Why?

37:07.921 --> 37:10.967
Was he acting funny
on the ride?

37:10.967 --> 37:12.273
Suspicious, cagey?

37:12.273 --> 37:13.709
No, not that I remember.

37:13.709 --> 37:15.972
But I was busy
doing other things,

37:15.972 --> 37:18.236
like calling ahead
to the ED and jotting down

37:18.236 --> 37:19.933
some patient information.

37:19.933 --> 37:22.283
Yeah, I was shouting a bunch
of questions at her

37:22.283 --> 37:23.806
from the front.

37:46.394 --> 37:47.874
Right under our noses.

38:09.548 --> 38:10.984
Too late, Gene.

38:10.984 --> 38:12.159
Huh?

38:19.209 --> 38:21.821
Hey, there, Gene.

38:21.821 --> 38:24.519
Explosion was bigger
than you expected, huh?

38:24.519 --> 38:26.347
You weren't planning
on a trip to the hospital.

38:26.347 --> 38:27.957
Hiding the diamonds
in the ambulance

38:27.957 --> 38:32.005
was a desperate move,
but it almost worked.

38:32.005 --> 38:33.354
Almost.

38:51.198 --> 38:52.504
Admit it.

38:52.504 --> 38:54.070
I'm a better partner
than Seager.

38:55.637 --> 38:57.552
You're a great partner.

38:57.552 --> 38:59.380
I'm better.
I'm a better partner.

38:59.380 --> 39:01.948
You're an amazing partner.

39:05.255 --> 39:07.345
You're the best partner.

39:07.345 --> 39:08.737
Damn right.

39:21.402 --> 39:23.404
Hey.

39:23.404 --> 39:25.319
Javi's done brushing his teeth.

39:25.319 --> 39:27.930
Oh. Okay. Hey!

39:30.368 --> 39:32.152
You ready for bed, amigo?

39:32.152 --> 39:33.501
No, but she says I am.

39:33.501 --> 39:35.590
Ha, that's right,
because it's bedtime.

39:35.590 --> 39:37.375
Ah, well,
you'd better listen to her.

39:37.375 --> 39:39.202
Okay.

39:39.202 --> 39:41.988
Oh!

39:41.988 --> 39:43.424
Good night, Javi.

39:43.424 --> 39:44.643
Good night, Dad.
