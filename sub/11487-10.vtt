WEBVTT

00:01.920 --> 00:03.512
Pretty fancy prices here.

00:03.880 --> 00:07.509
Yeah, well, just so we're clear,
l am picking up the tab tonight.

00:07.720 --> 00:10.234
-Okay.
-This is my celebration. l invited you.

00:10.600 --> 00:11.794
Fine.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.037
-So don't go grabbing the check.
-l won't touch the check.

00:17.160 --> 00:19.310
lf you wanna leave the tip,
that'd be okay.

00:19.840 --> 00:20.829
l could do that.

00:21.880 --> 00:23.518
l usually leave 1 5 percent. . .

00:23.720 --> 00:26.234
. . .but if you wanna leave 20,
that's your call.

00:26.920 --> 00:28.512
Thank you.

00:29.280 --> 00:32.158
Unless you think it's easier
if we just split the check.

00:32.759 --> 00:33.749
Whatever.

00:34.200 --> 00:37.670
Of course, in many families if someone
is celebrating some good news. . .

00:37.880 --> 00:40.235
. . .his brother would insist
on buying dinner.

00:41.600 --> 00:44.160
-Then why don't l do that.
-But l'll leave the tip.

00:44.360 --> 00:45.952
-One question.
-What?

00:46.160 --> 00:48.071
-Do you have any money?
-No.

00:50.840 --> 00:52.796
l left my wallet at home.

00:53.520 --> 00:55.397
You mean this wallet?

01:01.800 --> 01:03.392
Oh, good, you found it.

01:04.920 --> 01:07.036
l was looking all over.

01:08.320 --> 01:11.232
So where did we leave things?
You're paying, we're splitting?

01:11.440 --> 01:12.634
Oh, just shut up.

01:14.080 --> 01:16.150
What's this good news
you're celebrating?

01:16.360 --> 01:19.033
lt's a surprise.
l wanna wait till Mom gets here.

01:19.240 --> 01:22.755
Yes, Jake, we see the spoon
on your nose, now stop it.

01:22.960 --> 01:23.949
Can you do it?

01:24.160 --> 01:27.357
l don't want to do it.
Now, behave yourself.

01:29.360 --> 01:30.349
Oh, work with me.

01:32.880 --> 01:33.915
Just wonderful.

01:34.120 --> 01:36.315
You pick a restaurant
that has no valet.

01:36.520 --> 01:38.272
l had to park three blocks away. . .

01:38.480 --> 01:41.153
. . .and then schlep here in shoes
that are not for walking.

01:41.360 --> 01:43.635
l've got a blister the size
of a Communion wafer.

01:43.840 --> 01:46.479
And if Mommy doesn't get
something to drink immediately. . .

01:46.680 --> 01:48.989
. . .things are going to get very ugly.

01:49.800 --> 01:51.472
Let the celebration begin.

01:52.800 --> 01:57.112
Maybe the lesson here, Mom, is to buy
shoes that are made for walking.

01:57.920 --> 01:59.512
ls it just me?

01:59.720 --> 02:01.517
ln a perfect world, it would be.

02:03.120 --> 02:06.396
Well, anyway l'm here. So, what's
your big announcement, Alan?

02:06.600 --> 02:08.238
Jake, get that spoon off your nose.

02:08.440 --> 02:11.432
-You don't know where it's been.
-lt's been on my nose.

02:13.080 --> 02:16.550
You really must start looking
at trade schools for the boy.

02:16.760 --> 02:20.309
Now that we are all here,
l have some good news to share.

02:21.320 --> 02:24.153
This is not gonna be on the
newsstands for a couple of days. . .

02:24.360 --> 02:26.874
. . .but l have an advance copy.

02:30.640 --> 02:32.756
''Good doctor, good neighbor,
good guy. ''

02:32.960 --> 02:34.234
Good God.

02:35.040 --> 02:37.474
-Hey, Dad, you're famous.
-Well, not really.

02:37.680 --> 02:40.911
Well, among the readers of the
Tarzana Pennysaver, maybe a little.

02:41.120 --> 02:44.317
Don't forget the homeless people
who make underpants out of it.

02:44.920 --> 02:46.831
Charlie, don't be disrespectful.

02:47.040 --> 02:48.439
Thank you, Mom.

02:48.640 --> 02:52.599
So how much advertising did you have
to buy in exchange for this puff piece?

02:52.800 --> 02:54.995
Why do you assume
that l had to buy advertising?

02:55.200 --> 02:58.749
ls it that hard to believe that a local
newspaper might run a cover story. . .

02:58.960 --> 03:01.679
. . .about a successful
local chiropractor?

03:01.880 --> 03:03.233
Well, frankly, yes.

03:04.600 --> 03:07.751
Unless the chiropractor shot four
people to death in a mini-mart. . .

03:07.960 --> 03:10.235
. . .and then turned
the weapon on himself.

03:10.440 --> 03:13.830
You know, l get why Charlie has never
acknowledged my accomplishments.

03:14.040 --> 03:16.315
He's a hedonist
who can't get behind anyone. . .

03:16.520 --> 03:19.512
. . .unless they're drunk
and bent over a pool table.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.228
That's fair.

03:21.440 --> 03:22.873
But my own mother--

03:23.080 --> 03:25.230
You're up.

03:26.120 --> 03:27.712
Refusing to even feign interest.

03:27.920 --> 03:29.797
l did so feign interest.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.673
You assumed l had to buy advertising
to get the article.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.472
Well, did you?

03:34.680 --> 03:37.433
Neighborhood advertising
is a good investment.

03:38.240 --> 03:41.232
-But that is not the point.
-All right, what is the point?

03:41.440 --> 03:44.637
The point is, l can't even get
a simple attaboy from own my mother.

03:45.280 --> 03:48.477
Oh, well, l'm sorry.

03:50.720 --> 03:52.278
Attaboy.

03:54.120 --> 03:55.348
Feel better?

03:55.920 --> 03:59.151
-No, l do not feel better.
-Did l not say it right?

03:59.360 --> 04:03.319
You know what? Forget it.
Let's just order, eat and get out of here.

04:04.080 --> 04:06.230
One more of these,
and please keep them coming.

04:06.440 --> 04:09.159
l'll buy the drinks.
Unless you wanna split it with me.

04:11.000 --> 04:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:18.200 --> 04:21.589
And you know what else?
You know what else?

04:21.800 --> 04:23.472
No, Alan, what else?

04:23.680 --> 04:28.800
l cannot believe that our mother
made us carry her to her car. . .

04:29.000 --> 04:31.992
. . .just because she had a teeny-weeny
little blister on her foot.

04:33.360 --> 04:38.150
Well, hopefully the next time we have
to carry her she'll be in a handy urn.

04:40.480 --> 04:42.675
l'll pay for the urn
if you get the cremation.

04:42.880 --> 04:44.359
Done.

04:46.040 --> 04:48.554
-Jake? Where's my son?
-Right here, Dad.

04:48.760 --> 04:50.955
Oh, oh, good, good.

04:51.160 --> 04:53.116
Now, listen, boy.

04:54.160 --> 04:57.630
Your old dad
is not going to be here for--

05:03.600 --> 05:05.750
ls not going to be here forever.

05:05.960 --> 05:08.076
And when l'm gone. . .

05:08.280 --> 05:11.272
. . .l want there to be no doubt
in your mind. . .

05:11.480 --> 05:14.278
. . .that l was as proud as punch. . .

05:15.320 --> 05:20.235
. . .about all of your accomplishments,
no matter how miniscule.

05:20.720 --> 05:22.995
Boy, you're really plowed, aren't you?

05:24.160 --> 05:27.709
No. Your daddy doesn't get plowed.

05:28.200 --> 05:30.236
He just gets a little:

05:36.440 --> 05:40.752
Anyway, the important thing
for you to know. . .

05:40.960 --> 05:43.349
. . .is how much l love you.

05:43.760 --> 05:46.194
You told the waiter you loved him too.

05:47.760 --> 05:49.352
He was a very good waiter.

05:51.280 --> 05:55.956
And it's also important for you to know
that you can be anything you want.

05:56.160 --> 05:57.559
Anything in the world.

05:57.760 --> 06:00.957
-No, l can't.
-You're right. That's a crock.

06:03.600 --> 06:06.512
But l love you. . .

06:06.840 --> 06:09.070
. . .and you have cheeks like a beaver.

06:09.960 --> 06:11.518
Now go to bed.

06:11.720 --> 06:14.598
Dad, we've been learning
about alcohol abuse at school.

06:14.800 --> 06:17.917
And if you ever need a new liver
you can have half of mine.

06:18.120 --> 06:19.951
Hey, hey, hey.
l thought we had a deal.

06:20.160 --> 06:22.037
Oh, yeah. Sorry, Dad.

06:24.880 --> 06:26.871
Best 5 bucks l ever spent.

06:28.520 --> 06:31.512
Now come on, let's tuck you into bed.

06:31.720 --> 06:37.272
Why can't my mother appreciate me?
All l wanted was one sincere attaboy.

06:37.480 --> 06:38.993
Was that too much to ask?

06:42.680 --> 06:44.557
Attaboy.

06:48.240 --> 06:51.516
Well, that looks like the last
of the scallops.

06:52.360 --> 06:54.828
Now all we gotta do
is wait for dessert.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.797
Rainbow sherbet.

06:58.200 --> 07:00.191
Oh, that should be pretty.

07:01.200 --> 07:05.079
You know, l have spent
my entire life. . .

07:05.280 --> 07:08.397
. . .trying to please Mom
to make her proud of me.

07:08.600 --> 07:09.919
But no more.

07:10.120 --> 07:11.712
l am done trying.

07:11.920 --> 07:13.035
Good for you.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.715
Oh, excuse me.

07:21.360 --> 07:22.793
Nope.

07:24.360 --> 07:28.319
You know, if you put the seat down,
it's easier to rest your arms.

07:30.320 --> 07:32.356
Oh, you're right.

07:33.440 --> 07:35.476
You're a wise man, Charlie Harper.

07:35.960 --> 07:39.236
Well, l do have a few pockets
of specialized knowledge.

07:39.440 --> 07:41.908
Some might call it wisdom.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.638
And it seems warmer too.

07:46.040 --> 07:49.112
lt's further away from the cooling effect
of the water.

07:49.320 --> 07:53.916
Not to mention the residual body heat
accrued from thousands of ass hours.

07:58.160 --> 08:00.833
You've really given a lot of thought
to this.

08:01.560 --> 08:03.437
l'm thinking of writing a book.

08:03.800 --> 08:05.677
And l will read it.

08:06.080 --> 08:07.069
Thank you.

08:08.760 --> 08:10.239
You know what l am, Charlie?

08:10.680 --> 08:12.432
Yes.

08:12.640 --> 08:14.676
l am a pathological people pleaser.

08:15.440 --> 08:17.874
l had an entirely different answer.

08:18.400 --> 08:22.279
But more accurately,
l am a woman pleaser.

08:22.480 --> 08:25.677
No, Alan, l am a woman pleaser.

08:25.880 --> 08:29.350
You're a lonely guy
speckled with vomit.

08:29.800 --> 08:35.635
No, l'm not speaking physically,
l'm speaking psychologically.

08:36.480 --> 08:38.038
With Mom.

08:38.240 --> 08:40.309
With Judith.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.317
With every woman l've ever met.

08:42.520 --> 08:46.832
l have twisted myself into knots
just trying to get them to like me.

08:47.040 --> 08:48.917
My education. . .

08:49.120 --> 08:53.033
. . .my job, my clothes, my car. . .

08:53.240 --> 08:55.117
. . .my very behavior.

08:55.320 --> 09:00.030
All chosen simply to get women
to approve of me.

09:00.680 --> 09:02.955
And how's that worked out for you?

09:03.680 --> 09:05.398
They don't approve of me.

09:07.800 --> 09:10.030
But l am going to change, Charlie.

09:10.800 --> 09:14.395
l am no longer going to grovel
for Mom's approval. . .

09:14.600 --> 09:17.478
. . .or for the approval of any woman.

09:17.920 --> 09:22.072
l am going to live the remainder
of my life. . .

09:22.280 --> 09:23.679
. . .with pride. . .

09:23.880 --> 09:29.273
. . .and a quiet, noble dignity.

09:33.280 --> 09:36.909
But first, l'll sleep with my head
in the crapper.

10:01.920 --> 10:03.797
Can l make you some oatmeal?

10:04.320 --> 10:05.469
l've got cereal.

10:05.680 --> 10:06.999
l know.

10:07.200 --> 10:10.112
l just thought you might enjoy
something hot. . .

10:10.320 --> 10:12.515
. . .and quiet.

10:12.960 --> 10:14.029
Nope.

10:16.760 --> 10:18.159
Do you have a hangover?

10:18.600 --> 10:19.794
Yeah.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.673
Drinking that much
was a stupid thing to do.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.678
So then why'd you do it?

10:25.560 --> 10:26.595
l don't know, Jake.

10:26.800 --> 10:31.715
-Maybe l'm just stupid.
-Or maybe you just don't apply yourself.

10:34.920 --> 10:37.559
Can we stop talking for a while?

10:37.760 --> 10:39.432
Okay.

10:42.480 --> 10:45.756
Although l do like a little conversation
at breakfast.

10:47.200 --> 10:48.235
Morning, everybody.

10:48.640 --> 10:49.629
He's hung-over.

10:50.160 --> 10:51.434
Oh, yeah.

10:51.640 --> 10:54.154
Well, isn't this an ironic turn
of events?

10:54.360 --> 10:56.396
Me, waking up feeling
all bright and chipper.

10:56.600 --> 10:58.511
And you looking like a stool sample.

11:01.280 --> 11:02.998
Not a big irony fan, huh?

11:03.440 --> 11:04.839
-Charlie?
-Yeah.

11:05.040 --> 11:09.079
Either stop talking or at least
have the decency to kill me.

11:10.080 --> 11:13.072
-Boy, l'm never gonna drink.
-Good job.

11:13.280 --> 11:14.599
You scarred the kid for life.

11:14.800 --> 11:17.394
Now he's gonna have to face
junior high sober.

11:18.280 --> 11:20.874
-Just tell me one thing.
-What's that?

11:21.080 --> 11:23.913
Did l really tell the waiter
l loved him last night?

11:24.920 --> 11:27.753
You had to say something
after a kiss like that.

11:28.240 --> 11:30.310
Oh, God.

11:30.520 --> 11:32.590
-l took care of your bathroom.
-Thank you.

11:32.800 --> 11:35.997
l hope you like the smell
of pine-scented puke.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.230
So did l do anything else
l'm gonna regret?

11:40.440 --> 11:43.432
-Well, you paid for dinner.
-Jeez.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.639
And after we got home there was some
drunken blubbering. . .

11:48.840 --> 11:51.274
. . .about how you weren't
going to grovel for women.

11:51.480 --> 11:54.313
Oh, right. l almost forgot.

11:54.520 --> 11:57.353
l had a life-changing epiphany
last night.

11:57.560 --> 12:00.677
Before or after you yakked up
a hunk of your esophagus?

12:01.160 --> 12:02.752
No, no, it's no joke.

12:02.960 --> 12:04.951
l've reached a turning point.

12:05.160 --> 12:07.993
From this day on, my actions
will no longer be predicated. . .

12:08.200 --> 12:11.078
. . .on pleasing the castrating
mother figures in my life.

12:13.760 --> 12:16.433
-What's so funny?
-Nothing.

12:19.520 --> 12:21.238
l think she doubts your epiphany.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.394
She'll see.

12:23.600 --> 12:24.715
They'll all see.

12:24.920 --> 12:28.469
Starting now, l am a new Alan.

12:30.080 --> 12:32.640
Oh, damn, l think l wet myself.

12:32.960 --> 12:36.873
Starting now, l will fear
no woman's disapproval.

12:37.080 --> 12:40.959
Oh, God, that's Judith. l was supposed
to have Jake ready. She's gonna kill me.

12:42.600 --> 12:44.795
Okay, starting now.

12:45.320 --> 12:46.469
Good for you.

12:46.880 --> 12:48.871
-Oh, l better get that.
-Let her wait.

12:49.080 --> 12:53.471
What she thinks of you doesn't matter.
What counts is what you think of you.

12:53.680 --> 12:54.749
You're right.

12:54.960 --> 12:56.951
lt's what l think of me.

13:00.280 --> 13:03.795
-Alan?
-l had so much potential.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.116
Okay, forget what you think of you.

13:06.320 --> 13:08.754
Yeah, l'm probably too close to me
to see me clearly.

13:08.960 --> 13:10.518
Yeah, that's it.

13:11.560 --> 13:12.834
Oh, do l smell like vomit?

13:13.040 --> 13:15.998
Don't worry, l'll stand next to you.
She'll assume it's me.

13:16.200 --> 13:18.509
Good, good.

13:20.520 --> 13:21.794
Hi, Alan. Jake ready?

13:23.120 --> 13:25.680
-No, he is not.
-You said you'd have him ready.

13:28.680 --> 13:29.669
Well, l don't.

13:29.880 --> 13:35.750
And if that makes you unhappy with me,
well, l don't give a rat's furry ass.

13:36.680 --> 13:39.752
-What did you just say to me?
-Nothing, l'm sorry. Jake.

13:39.960 --> 13:42.315
-Starting now?
-Starting soon.

13:45.800 --> 13:47.552
You know what that smell is?

13:47.760 --> 13:50.672
Epiphany for men.

13:53.960 --> 13:56.030
So how long you been
in Los Angeles?

13:56.240 --> 13:58.913
About eight months.
Haven't got a single audition yet.

13:59.120 --> 14:02.237
Yeah, this can be a tough town
when you don't know anybody.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.789
So do you have
like a headshot or a résumé?

14:13.440 --> 14:15.112
-ls he okay?
-l don't know.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.471
Sir, are you okay?

14:18.320 --> 14:21.596
-l thought we came here to talk.
-Not to each other.

14:28.320 --> 14:30.880
-Let's talk. What's bothering you?
-l changed my mind. . .

14:31.080 --> 14:33.355
-. . .l don't wanna talk about it.
-Talk or die.

14:35.040 --> 14:37.031
All right. l'm depressed.

14:37.240 --> 14:39.754
l wanna change but l can't.
Whenever l'm confronted. . .

14:39.960 --> 14:42.554
. . .by a disapproving woman,
something inside me crumbles.

14:42.760 --> 14:44.876
Well, Alan,
maybe that's just who you are.

14:45.080 --> 14:49.198
You know, fish gotta swim,
birds gotta fly, you gotta crumble.

14:50.160 --> 14:53.197
What l don't understand
is l can intellectually see the problem. . .

14:53.400 --> 14:55.311
. . .but l just can't do anything about it.

14:55.520 --> 14:58.114
Excuse me. Can l have more
of these little pretzels?

14:58.320 --> 15:01.153
-ln a minute.
-Okay, sorry. No hurry.

15:02.120 --> 15:03.838
Look, it's very simple.

15:04.040 --> 15:06.156
You were conditioned
to seek Mom's approval.

15:06.360 --> 15:08.112
You're still seeking Mom's approval. . .

15:08.320 --> 15:10.470
. . .and you make every woman
a substitute mom.

15:10.680 --> 15:12.716
But what about you?
We had the same mother.

15:13.240 --> 15:15.435
l handle my conditioning
in a different way.

15:15.640 --> 15:18.552
l have casual and often degrading sex
with my substitute moms. . .

15:18.760 --> 15:22.230
. . .but we're talking about you
and not me so forget l said that.

15:25.800 --> 15:28.109
Oh, how l'll try.

15:28.320 --> 15:31.153
But how do you deal with the fear
of disapproval?

15:31.360 --> 15:33.351
l mean, you must get
shot down occasionally.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.313
Occasionally? Constantly.

15:35.520 --> 15:37.112
Constantly?

15:37.320 --> 15:39.231
Occasionally.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.792
lt's a numbers game, Alan.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.468
We all want the shiny apple
on top of the tree.

15:44.680 --> 15:48.150
But sometimes you gotta settle
for one on a lower branch.

15:48.360 --> 15:51.557
Of course, there's times you pick up
whatever's lying on the ground. . .

15:51.760 --> 15:53.557
. . .and put it in your mouth.

15:54.240 --> 15:57.789
But how do you manage to keep going
on in the face of constant rejection?

15:58.320 --> 15:59.719
Occasional rejection.

16:01.040 --> 16:03.395
Okay, lesson one:

16:03.600 --> 16:04.999
Look around.

16:05.200 --> 16:08.954
Out of all the women here, which one
do you find the most attractive?

16:09.160 --> 16:10.673
Let's see.

16:27.400 --> 16:28.549
Her.

16:28.760 --> 16:29.795
The brunette? Why?

16:30.280 --> 16:32.396
l don't know,
there's just something about her.

16:33.080 --> 16:37.312
-Yeah, radiating waves of contempt.
-You asked me who l found attractive.

16:37.520 --> 16:38.509
That's true.

16:38.720 --> 16:42.076
She's your shiny apple. Now go
ask her if you can buy her a drink.

16:42.280 --> 16:44.271
What about the radiating waves
of contempt?

16:44.480 --> 16:47.517
That's just a defense mechanism
for a girl in a lot of pain.

16:47.720 --> 16:49.870
-Really?
-How the hell should l know?

16:51.000 --> 16:53.833
The point is, you can't let fear
stand in your way.

16:55.600 --> 16:58.717
-Well, l disagree.
-Are you questioning my methods?

16:58.920 --> 17:02.071
-Because we can stop right now.
-No, no, l'll do it. l'll do it.

17:05.440 --> 17:07.078
Would you like some more pretzels?

17:07.440 --> 17:11.035
Well, l am in the mood
for something salty and twisted.

17:11.240 --> 17:14.277
-You're terrible.
-You have no idea.

17:18.440 --> 17:21.796
-How'd it go?
-She's really got a mouth on her.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.228
So she rejected you?

17:23.440 --> 17:25.635
With anatomical specificity.

17:26.200 --> 17:28.555
-Good.
-Good? How is that good?

17:28.920 --> 17:31.434
-How do you feel now?
-What do you mean, how do l feel?

17:31.640 --> 17:33.232
-l feel humiliated.
-Where?

17:33.600 --> 17:35.192
-What?
-Where is the humiliation?

17:35.400 --> 17:38.472
-Where do you feel it?
-Oh, well, let's see.

17:38.680 --> 17:42.559
My stomach's all knotted, my heart is
pounding, l'm sweating like a pig.

17:42.760 --> 17:44.193
Okay, end of lesson one.

17:44.400 --> 17:47.392
That was lesson one?
Lesson one sucked.

17:47.920 --> 17:50.753
Lesson two: Have a drink.

17:51.320 --> 17:53.675
No, sweetheart, have a real drink.

17:55.960 --> 17:58.758
-l don't like Scotch.
-lt's okay, it's bourbon.

17:58.960 --> 18:00.359
Oh, all right.

18:05.080 --> 18:06.638
More.

18:10.960 --> 18:12.029
How do you feel now?

18:13.160 --> 18:15.594
-l feel a little better.
-Finish the drink.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.991
Can l put some diet Sprite in it?

18:18.880 --> 18:20.313
Just finish it.

18:24.920 --> 18:27.559
There you go. Now how do you feel?

18:29.480 --> 18:30.674
l feel pretty good.

18:32.920 --> 18:35.639
Like, to hell with her.
Who cares what she thinks?

18:35.840 --> 18:37.478
Perfect.

18:37.680 --> 18:40.831
Now go ask that chick over there
if you can buy her a drink.

18:41.200 --> 18:44.317
Wait a minute. Wait a minute,
that's your big secret? Alcohol?

18:45.640 --> 18:47.596
Don't tell anybody.

18:48.720 --> 18:53.032
-lsn't that just a temporary solution?
-lt's only temporary if you stop drinking.

18:54.440 --> 18:55.793
l like it.

18:59.400 --> 19:01.675
Diet Sprite.

19:09.440 --> 19:10.759
l gotta hand it to you, Alan.

19:10.960 --> 19:14.316
Most guys would be off scallops
for a long time.

19:15.360 --> 19:17.032
l like scallops.

19:17.240 --> 19:19.629
But clearly they don't like you.

19:19.840 --> 19:23.037
l guess you choose your seafood
like you choose your women.

19:23.240 --> 19:24.468
l beg to differ.

19:24.680 --> 19:28.468
When it comes to women,
l make them sick.

19:31.280 --> 19:32.838
Fair enough.

19:33.040 --> 19:35.235
So, what else did we learn tonight?

19:35.440 --> 19:37.476
Well, let's see.

19:37.680 --> 19:41.468
l learned that to overcome my fear
of rejection ingrained in me. . .

19:41.680 --> 19:43.955
. . .by an emotionally distant mother. . .

19:44.160 --> 19:47.357
. . .l need to completely disable
my central nervous system. . .

19:47.560 --> 19:50.757
. . .with semi-lethal quantities
of alcohol.

19:51.400 --> 19:53.152
Bravo.

19:54.600 --> 19:56.591
Hey, Charlie, are you coming to bed
or what?

19:57.000 --> 19:58.399
l'll be there in a second.

19:58.600 --> 20:01.876
-What're you looking at?
-Sorry. Very sorry.

20:03.240 --> 20:04.958
So how've you been?

20:08.440 --> 20:09.589
lt worked.

20:09.800 --> 20:12.633
l am totally humiliated
and l don't care.

20:13.960 --> 20:16.235
You made real progress tonight.
l'm proud of you.

20:16.440 --> 20:20.433
Thanks, Charlie. You're a good teacher
and a good brother.

20:20.640 --> 20:22.278
Thanks.

20:24.680 --> 20:28.878
Well, l guess it's time for me
to go work out my issues.

20:32.120 --> 20:33.553
Good night, pal.

20:33.760 --> 20:35.478
Nighty-night.
