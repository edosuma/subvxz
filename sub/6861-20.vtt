WEBVTT

00:03.271 --> 00:05.073
Well, you don't have to,
'cause it's over.

00:05.073 --> 00:07.575
Magnolia told me George
broke off the wedding--
what's going on?

00:07.575 --> 00:09.810
I cheated on George.
 Did you really think that

00:09.810 --> 00:11.812
about me, that I'm
snobbish and shallow?

00:11.812 --> 00:13.214
Yeah, I do.
 Turns out that

00:13.214 --> 00:15.049
Lemon wasn't my destiny,
so now it's my job

00:15.049 --> 00:17.285
to go find out who
 that destiny is.

00:17.285 --> 00:18.819
What is that look
on your face?
Hope.

00:18.819 --> 00:21.222
'Cause now I know that
 George and I would be...

00:21.222 --> 00:23.424
that we could
 be great together.

00:24.425 --> 00:27.661
* *

00:27.661 --> 00:29.297
(knocking)

00:30.864 --> 00:31.965
Uh...

00:31.965 --> 00:33.067
Zoe?

00:33.067 --> 00:34.502
Um...

00:36.837 --> 00:39.173
George? One sec.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.243
* *

00:43.911 --> 00:45.913
(panting)

00:45.913 --> 00:48.582
(sniffs, clears throat)

00:48.582 --> 00:50.618
Come in!

00:51.985 --> 00:52.986
(exhales)

00:52.986 --> 00:54.555
(low groan)

00:54.555 --> 00:55.689
Hi.

00:55.689 --> 00:56.724
Hey.
Hi.

00:56.724 --> 00:57.925
Um, I'm...

00:57.925 --> 00:59.293
sorry it's a little early.

00:59.293 --> 01:00.661
I was just, uh...

01:00.661 --> 01:03.831
I was kind of up all night
wanting to talk to you.

01:03.831 --> 01:04.831
Here.

01:04.831 --> 01:06.200
Thanks.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.436
That's okay.
I-I'm glad you're here.

01:08.436 --> 01:11.239
How did it go last
night with Lemon?

01:11.239 --> 01:13.241
It was hard. Um...

01:13.241 --> 01:14.842
I yelled a lot,

01:14.842 --> 01:17.145
she cried... a lot,

01:17.145 --> 01:20.681
and, uh... told her
the wedding was off.

01:20.681 --> 01:22.216
You did?
Yeah. Yeah.

01:22.216 --> 01:25.886
Uh, I'm sorry,
um, are you okay?

01:25.886 --> 01:27.555
I will be.

01:27.555 --> 01:30.591
We're gonna...
tell the minister in
a couple of hours,

01:30.591 --> 01:34.162
and I think... making
it official will help.

01:34.162 --> 01:35.296
Definitely.

01:35.296 --> 01:38.166
Possibly. I mean,
I-I hope so.

01:38.166 --> 01:40.601
(laughs): I'm sorry,
I'm flustered.

01:40.601 --> 01:41.969
That's okay.

01:41.969 --> 01:43.571
So am I.

01:43.571 --> 01:45.539
Look, uh...

01:45.539 --> 01:47.808
I can't stop thinking
about last night.

01:47.808 --> 01:51.979
It was possibly the
best night of my life.

01:51.979 --> 01:53.647
Me, too.

01:53.647 --> 01:55.283
But, um...

01:55.283 --> 01:58.186
we kind of got a
little swept away.

01:58.186 --> 02:00.053
You know?

02:00.053 --> 02:01.789
I know. We did.

02:01.789 --> 02:04.292
We so did.
Yeah.

02:04.292 --> 02:06.260
I'm just coming out of
a 15-year relationship,

02:06.260 --> 02:08.196
so, you know, I was
thinking that maybe

02:08.196 --> 02:11.865
jumping right into another
one might not be fair

02:11.865 --> 02:14.435
for anyone...
Right.

02:14.435 --> 02:16.837
And, um... you
know what they say:

02:16.837 --> 02:19.740
you know, it's better
to be fair than not fair.

02:19.740 --> 02:23.076
I think they say that.
Yeah, and this
is gonna sound

02:23.076 --> 02:24.712
real clichÃ©d, but...

02:24.712 --> 02:26.747
I was just, um...

02:26.747 --> 02:28.482
(sighs)

02:28.482 --> 02:31.452
Maybe if it's okay
with you, uh, for now,

02:31.452 --> 02:33.754
we could just stay friends?

02:33.754 --> 02:35.289
Just...

02:35.289 --> 02:37.024
Friends. Yeah.

02:37.024 --> 02:38.459
Absolutely.

02:38.459 --> 02:41.161
You know, uh, that is...
that is so the right thing,

02:41.161 --> 02:43.364
and I was going
to suggest it, even.

02:43.364 --> 02:45.566
GEORGE:
Great. Okay.
Oh. Hey, Tucker.

02:45.566 --> 02:48.168
Didn't expect to see
 you here so early.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.870
I hope I'm not
interrupting.

02:49.870 --> 02:52.840
Lavon, he-he injured
his ankle pretty badly,

02:52.840 --> 02:54.775
so...

02:54.775 --> 02:55.776
Yeah.

02:55.776 --> 02:58.178
'Kay, I'll be
right there.

02:59.780 --> 03:03.851
I guess I'll see
you around... pal.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.586
Thanks for...

03:05.586 --> 03:06.820
Yeah.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.761
How on earth did you
fall out of a tree?

03:13.761 --> 03:15.696
We were training
for the BlueBell Battle.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.731
Yeah, and there's
$5,000 at stake.

03:17.731 --> 03:19.667
And we got to be able
to do anything.

03:19.667 --> 03:22.870
Bull riding, building
plantations out of macaroni,

03:22.870 --> 03:24.338
eating bugs.

03:24.338 --> 03:27.140
So what's the verdict,
he gonna be okay?

03:27.140 --> 03:29.410
Wha... What,
you still ignoring me?

03:29.410 --> 03:32.280
Ask her if you're gonna
be okay for the race.

03:32.280 --> 03:33.814
Look, this is
ridiculous.

03:33.814 --> 03:37.418
Zoe, can I be
in the race?
Nope.

03:37.418 --> 03:39.553
Please?
No. You have
a bad sprain.

03:39.553 --> 03:42.089
You have to keep it stable
until the swelling goes down.

03:42.089 --> 03:43.491
This is great.
Thank you.

03:43.491 --> 03:46.760
You know, everything
bad happens to me!
(sighs)

03:46.760 --> 03:48.296
I have an idea.

03:48.296 --> 03:50.331
How about to distract
you from your pain

03:50.331 --> 03:52.766
we talk about what happened
to me this morning.

03:52.766 --> 03:54.034
George came over.

03:54.034 --> 03:56.270
Uh-huh.
He and Lemon

03:56.270 --> 03:57.705
are calling off the wedding.

03:57.705 --> 04:01.008
But he says that we just
have to stay friends for now.

04:01.008 --> 04:02.643
I'm sorry?
I was upset

04:02.643 --> 04:06.414
at first, because I know he felt
what I felt in New Orleans.

04:06.414 --> 04:08.015
But then I realized

04:08.015 --> 04:09.583
he said "for now,"

04:09.583 --> 04:11.251
meaning in the future,

04:11.251 --> 04:13.253
after a respectable
grieving period,

04:13.253 --> 04:15.122
George and I will
finally be together.

04:15.122 --> 04:16.624
Isn't that great?

04:16.624 --> 04:18.726
Look, whenever I say anything
about you and George Tucker,

04:18.726 --> 04:20.928
you either don't listen
to me or you get angry.

04:20.928 --> 04:21.962
So from now on,

04:21.962 --> 04:25.198
all I'm gonna say is...
"No comment."

04:25.198 --> 04:27.267
Okay. That's fair.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.470
But... how long
of a grieving period

04:29.470 --> 04:32.072
do you think people need
after 15 years?

04:32.072 --> 04:33.273
Couple weeks?

04:33.273 --> 04:34.942
Oh, mm-mm.
A month?

04:34.942 --> 04:36.143
Not-not two months.

04:36.143 --> 04:38.278
Right? Lavon?

04:38.278 --> 04:40.548
* *

04:43.417 --> 04:45.486
Well, hello,
George, Lemon.

04:45.486 --> 04:47.621
What brings you two
lovebirds here today?

04:47.621 --> 04:51.492
Well, uh, Reverend
Mayfair, um...

04:51.492 --> 04:55.095
Lemon and I have decided
to call off our wedding.

04:55.095 --> 04:57.365
(laughs)
That's funny.

04:57.365 --> 04:58.899
(stops
laughing)

04:58.899 --> 05:01.034
Oh, you're not...
you're not kidding.

05:01.034 --> 05:04.037
Uh, I'm sorry, I didn't
understand. Uh...

05:04.037 --> 05:05.739
what happened?

05:05.739 --> 05:08.976
Well, it's a long
story, and...

05:08.976 --> 05:12.480
neither of us are looking
to point fingers right now.

05:12.480 --> 05:14.682
We'd just,
well... (sighs)

05:14.682 --> 05:17.418
like your advice on how
best to deal with this.

05:17.418 --> 05:19.753
Well, I will help
in any way I can.

05:19.753 --> 05:21.288
But let me
ask you, now,

05:21.288 --> 05:25.058
is this something that the both
of you are certain you want?

05:25.058 --> 05:26.126
LEMON:
No.

05:26.126 --> 05:27.395
It's not what I want, Reverend,

05:27.395 --> 05:28.696
it's not.
Lemon...

05:30.531 --> 05:33.000
See, George is...

05:33.000 --> 05:34.201
angry.

05:34.201 --> 05:36.269
He is furious, and...

05:36.269 --> 05:38.071
who can blame him?

05:38.071 --> 05:41.742
He just found out that
I was having an affair.

05:42.876 --> 05:45.278
Uh, what, now?
It was a year ago,

05:45.278 --> 05:48.048
and it was a...
horrible mistake.

05:48.048 --> 05:51.218
And I know that the wedding
is coming up in two weeks

05:51.218 --> 05:54.422
and that may not be enough time
for George to forgive me,

05:54.422 --> 05:56.023
but I will do anything

05:56.023 --> 05:57.691
for another chance.

05:58.959 --> 06:00.227
Well...

06:00.227 --> 06:01.629
thank you for that, Lemon.

06:01.629 --> 06:03.831
I know that wasn't easy.

06:03.831 --> 06:04.965
George,

06:04.965 --> 06:06.366
what Lemon did

06:06.366 --> 06:08.168
was an enormous transgression,

06:08.168 --> 06:11.304
one that I can't expect you
to take lightly,

06:11.304 --> 06:14.241
but clearly, she
still loves you.

06:14.241 --> 06:15.275
Now, is there

06:15.275 --> 06:17.277
any hope that, in time,

06:17.277 --> 06:19.580
you will be able
to forgive her?

06:19.580 --> 06:22.716
This isn't about
forgiveness, Reverend,

06:22.716 --> 06:24.752
this is about
our relationship,
and the foundation

06:24.752 --> 06:26.720
of our relationship
is broken.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.656
And...

06:28.656 --> 06:31.425
(clears throat)
I don't know
if I love her anymore.

06:31.425 --> 06:33.461
Now, now,

06:33.461 --> 06:34.595
you "don't know."

06:34.595 --> 06:36.129
Now, that's a key phrase.

06:36.129 --> 06:38.799
George, you're in pain.

06:38.799 --> 06:41.101
Pain, sometimes
it can cloud the truth,

06:41.101 --> 06:44.605
which is why I cannot,
in good conscience,

06:44.605 --> 06:47.808
let you end this without
at least trying counseling.

06:47.808 --> 06:50.343
Now, just to find
some clarity,

06:50.343 --> 06:53.413
please, just a few sessions.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.616
* *

06:57.551 --> 06:59.086
WADE:
 Look, Tom,

06:59.086 --> 07:00.954
I wouldn't be asking
if I weren't desperate.

07:00.954 --> 07:02.756
But, uh...

07:02.756 --> 07:04.625
what are your plans
for the BlueBell Battle?

07:04.625 --> 07:08.195
Well, I was gonna be
one of those guys who
hands out orange slices.

07:08.195 --> 07:09.930
I'm no good under pressure.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.098
I choke.

07:11.098 --> 07:13.767
(Tom gulps, chokes)

07:13.767 --> 07:15.368
(coughs)
Hi, Wanda.

07:15.368 --> 07:16.770
Hi. Hello.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.906
I like your sweater, Tom.

07:18.906 --> 07:21.441
The puppies really
bring out your eyes.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.243
That's why my mom
got it for me.

07:23.243 --> 07:25.412
I was wondering...

07:25.412 --> 07:27.581
would you be my partner

07:27.581 --> 07:29.750
for the BlueBell Battle?

07:30.450 --> 07:31.351
(coughs)

07:31.351 --> 07:33.186
Yes. Yes. Yes.

07:33.186 --> 07:34.622
WANDA:
Great.

07:34.622 --> 07:35.856
I'll see you then.

07:36.389 --> 07:37.925
TANSY:
Bye.

07:37.925 --> 07:40.494
(quietly):
Did you hear that?
That's our first date!

07:40.494 --> 07:41.662
Yeah, I heard.

07:41.662 --> 07:43.997
I am never washing
this sweater again!

07:43.997 --> 07:45.999
(laughs)

07:47.034 --> 07:49.002
I know how much you
want that prize money.

07:49.002 --> 07:51.138
I wish I could do
the race with you.

07:51.138 --> 07:52.673
Me, too.
That stupid rule

07:52.673 --> 07:54.808
that says you got
 to live in BlueBell.

07:54.808 --> 07:57.077
Well, we'll just have to find
you the perfect partner.

07:57.077 --> 07:59.379
Which, let's face it,
wasn't Tom Long, anyway.

07:59.379 --> 08:01.515
What are you looking
for in a teammate?

08:01.515 --> 08:03.684
Well... (clears throat)

08:03.684 --> 08:05.686
my assets are, uh...

08:05.686 --> 08:08.421
A) Know this town like
the back of my hand;
Mm-hmm.

08:08.421 --> 08:10.057
B) Mechanical;

08:10.057 --> 08:11.825
C) Wily;

08:11.825 --> 08:14.962
Wily.
D) I can hold my breath
for three minutes,

08:14.962 --> 08:15.996
you know that?

08:15.996 --> 08:16.897
Oh.
But...

08:16.897 --> 08:18.666
I'm not traditionally

08:18.666 --> 08:22.369
book-smart, especially
when those books have
something to do with math.

08:22.369 --> 08:25.706
And ideally, I'd find
a partner who, uh, has
good, fine motor skills,

08:25.706 --> 08:27.541
'cause I can barely
thread a needle.

08:27.541 --> 08:29.843
You need Zoe Hart.

08:29.843 --> 08:30.978
(laughs)

08:30.978 --> 08:33.714
She's a surgeon; she
can fit in small spaces.

08:33.714 --> 08:36.583
You just have to make her
take off those heels.

08:36.583 --> 08:38.385
Zoe Hart would never
be my partner.

08:38.385 --> 08:39.852
Why?

08:39.852 --> 08:42.556
Y-You're not still hung
up on her, are you?
No,

08:42.556 --> 08:44.157
no, no, it's not that.

08:44.157 --> 08:45.458
Uh...

08:45.458 --> 08:48.095
she overheard me say some...

08:48.095 --> 08:51.865
unkind-- but true--
things about her recently,

08:51.865 --> 08:54.401
and, uh, well,
she's pissed at me.

08:54.401 --> 08:58.338
Well, I can think of
5,000 reasons this is a
good time to apologize.

08:58.338 --> 09:00.674
(quiet chuckle)

09:00.674 --> 09:02.442
* *

09:02.442 --> 09:04.177
ROSE:
Zoe!

09:04.177 --> 09:06.079
Hi.
I have huge news.

09:06.079 --> 09:08.081
Mm, what?
Okay, well,
as you know,

09:08.081 --> 09:10.117
ever since Magnolia
broke up with
Frederick Dean,

09:10.117 --> 09:11.885
I've been dropping
hints, hoping,

09:11.885 --> 09:14.321
and yesterday he
finally asked me out.

09:14.321 --> 09:15.756
Oh, whoo-hoo!
See? It was only

09:15.756 --> 09:18.592
a matter of time before
these men pick the right girl.

09:18.592 --> 09:20.193
I know. But there's
just one problem:

09:20.193 --> 09:22.562
my mom won't let me
date till I'm 15.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.765
Oh, no. I'm so sorry.
No, no, please,

09:24.765 --> 09:26.600
you have to talk to her.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.368
Tell her that there
is no sound reason

09:28.368 --> 09:30.671
that I have to wait
for my arbitrary birthday

09:30.671 --> 09:32.439
to live my life.
You're a doctor--

09:32.439 --> 09:35.142
just tell her that this
can cause developmental issues.

09:35.142 --> 09:38.111
Rose, no, I cannot interfere
with her parental decisions.

09:38.111 --> 09:40.513
Please? My stomach
is in knots about this.

09:40.513 --> 09:41.649
I can't even eat.

09:41.649 --> 09:42.916
You of all people know

09:42.916 --> 09:45.886
how I feel about Frederick Dean.

09:47.788 --> 09:49.657
I... do know.

09:49.657 --> 09:52.660
Yes, I know that... you
have waited patiently

09:52.660 --> 09:54.895
for him to finally break up
with his girlfriend,

09:54.895 --> 09:58.265
and you've dutifully been his
friend while he got over it.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.533
And I know that now

10:00.533 --> 10:01.802
it is...

10:01.802 --> 10:03.837
your time to be happy.

10:03.837 --> 10:06.473
So... yes, I will
talk to your mother.

10:06.473 --> 10:08.876
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

10:10.543 --> 10:12.479
Hey, George.

10:12.479 --> 10:13.814
Buddy.

10:13.814 --> 10:15.649
How'd it go with the minister?

10:15.649 --> 10:17.517
Well, not exactly
as planned.

10:17.517 --> 10:19.086
He, um...

10:19.086 --> 10:21.288
convinced us to do counseling.

10:22.322 --> 10:24.825
Hey. Well, that's cool.

10:24.825 --> 10:26.093
I think it's ridiculous myself,

10:26.093 --> 10:28.195
but I don't know,
I guess there might be

10:28.195 --> 10:29.830
some merit to it.
That... yeah.

10:29.830 --> 10:32.432
I think that, uh, therapy
is a great idea.

10:32.432 --> 10:34.134
Yeah. Yeah.

10:36.269 --> 10:37.604
Well, thank you

10:37.604 --> 10:40.273
for understanding
all this.

10:40.273 --> 10:44.277
I'm real lucky to have
you in my life, Zoe.
Oh. (chuckles)

10:44.277 --> 10:46.747
sighs)

10:46.747 --> 10:49.316
(car horn honks)

10:49.316 --> 10:51.451
(seagulls calling)

10:51.451 --> 10:53.754
(birds singing)

10:58.358 --> 11:00.527
(groaning)
Counseling never
works, right?

11:00.527 --> 11:02.062
It's a well known fact.

11:02.062 --> 11:05.232
Tony Soprano was in counseling
for, like, the entire series.

11:05.232 --> 11:07.234
Did he stop
killing people? No.

11:07.234 --> 11:09.436
And she was a really
good therapist.

11:09.436 --> 11:10.871
No comment.

11:10.871 --> 11:12.372
ZOE:
Whoa!

11:12.372 --> 11:14.607
You can't just barge in here.
I'm with a patient.

11:14.607 --> 11:17.044
It's Lavon.

11:17.044 --> 11:19.246
But... you're right.

11:19.246 --> 11:21.481
I apologize.

11:21.481 --> 11:22.950
What do you want?

11:22.950 --> 11:24.818
Look, I know
you're angry at me,

11:24.818 --> 11:27.687
so, I'm sorry or whatever,

11:27.687 --> 11:30.924
but I'm hoping
we can put that behind us

11:30.924 --> 11:33.393
so you'll be my partner

11:33.393 --> 11:35.062
in the race
tomorrow. I...

11:35.062 --> 11:37.497
think we could be
a really good team.

11:37.497 --> 11:39.332
(laughs)
That's funny.

11:39.332 --> 11:41.601
That was a good one.

11:41.601 --> 11:43.336
Oh, you're not joking?

11:45.939 --> 11:47.474
(door closes,
Zoe sighs)

11:47.474 --> 11:49.476
What is with that guy?

11:51.912 --> 11:54.047
MAYFAIR:
I'm so glad that

11:54.047 --> 11:55.582
you've both agreed to be here.

11:55.582 --> 11:56.950
It's a huge step.

11:56.950 --> 11:59.452
And, uh, with the wedding
right around the corner,

11:59.452 --> 12:02.923
we have to try to do a lot
in a small amount of time.

12:02.923 --> 12:04.257
Now, uh, you ready?

12:04.257 --> 12:05.425
Yes.
Great.

12:05.425 --> 12:06.293
Let's begin.

12:07.795 --> 12:10.697
George...

12:10.697 --> 12:13.100
I appreciate
what a kind heart you have.

12:13.100 --> 12:15.368
I appreciate how selflessly

12:15.368 --> 12:17.838
you give yourself
to anyone who's in need.

12:17.838 --> 12:20.373
I appreciate
your sweet green eyes.

12:20.373 --> 12:22.242
MAYFAIR:
That's wonderful, Lemon.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.177
George, your turn.

12:24.177 --> 12:26.046
Lemon...

12:27.714 --> 12:31.151
...I appreciate
that you feel that way.

12:32.920 --> 12:37.224
So, use the paddles to express
your emotions right now.

12:37.224 --> 12:39.226
Go ahead.

12:42.629 --> 12:46.399
Yeah, you know what,
Reverend?

12:46.399 --> 12:48.768
Think there's got...

12:48.768 --> 12:52.772
I... I think that this is not
possibly the-the best way to...

12:52.772 --> 12:55.008
Let it out, George.
Let it out.

12:55.008 --> 12:57.477
I think there's got to be...
there's got to be...

12:57.477 --> 12:59.379
Go ahead.
...got to be
a better way.

12:59.379 --> 13:02.015
There's just got
to be a better way.
Let it go.

13:02.015 --> 13:03.450
Just-Just...
Just stop it!
(gasps)

13:03.450 --> 13:05.352
Would you just, just stop?!

13:05.352 --> 13:07.454
(whimpering)

13:07.454 --> 13:08.588
(sighs)

13:08.588 --> 13:10.390
(gasps)

13:10.390 --> 13:12.860
Apparently, very mad
at that thing.

13:12.860 --> 13:15.428
Well, no one said
this was going to be easy,

13:15.428 --> 13:19.732
but I'd like you to try one
last thing before we give up.

13:19.732 --> 13:20.868
Anything, anything.

13:20.868 --> 13:22.369
No. Come on.
Anything.

13:22.369 --> 13:24.104
Now, I know you two
are still signed up

13:24.104 --> 13:25.338
for the BlueBell Battle.

13:25.338 --> 13:27.374
I'd love for you
to go through with it.

13:27.374 --> 13:28.641
Oh, yes.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.277
Why on earth would we do that?

13:30.277 --> 13:33.013
It's a day of working together,
communicating,

13:33.013 --> 13:35.415
seeing what you can accomplish
as a team.

13:35.415 --> 13:38.251
And, well, as metaphors go,
it's, uh,

13:38.251 --> 13:39.319
pretty darn solid.
You know what? No.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.620
I think it's
a great idea.

13:40.620 --> 13:42.389
No, no and no.
It's a...
Yes, oh, yes.

13:42.389 --> 13:43.891
Yes.
I-I...
Now, George, now,

13:43.891 --> 13:46.526
I don't want to have
to play the big G card

13:46.526 --> 13:47.861
on you here, but

13:47.861 --> 13:51.164
I am your minister,
and I know that he

13:51.164 --> 13:54.935
would want you to take one last
shot before you throw away

13:54.935 --> 13:58.238
15 years of... of history.

14:02.209 --> 14:03.443
(laughs)

14:03.443 --> 14:05.112
Yeah, Irma,
just out of curiosity,

14:05.112 --> 14:06.980
as one who loves facts
and figures,

14:06.980 --> 14:09.950
what is the final day
that I can cancel the catering

14:09.950 --> 14:12.920
for the wedding and, uh,
still get my money back?

14:12.920 --> 14:15.822
Oh, yeah, as in two days
from now. I see, uh...

14:15.822 --> 14:16.856
(door opens)

14:16.856 --> 14:18.225
Oh, yeah, uh, just

14:18.225 --> 14:20.527
keep taking those aspirin
every four hours, yeah.

14:20.527 --> 14:21.761
Good-bye.

14:21.761 --> 14:22.930
Lemonade!

14:22.930 --> 14:24.031
Hi, Daddy.

14:24.031 --> 14:25.933
You are looking
so much brighter.

14:25.933 --> 14:27.567
Therapy is working!

14:27.567 --> 14:29.169
He forgave you?

14:29.169 --> 14:31.104
Well, not yet,
but he agreed

14:31.104 --> 14:32.839
to do the BlueBell
Battle with me!

14:32.839 --> 14:35.408
Oh. Well, that is great,

14:35.408 --> 14:37.210
but the wedding...?

14:37.210 --> 14:40.180
Well, I mean, technically it's
still off, but all tomorrow,

14:40.180 --> 14:42.082
we will be working
in close quarters,

14:42.082 --> 14:44.717
under extreme conditions,
and we will connect again.

14:44.717 --> 14:47.520
And when we win, there's no
way that George will be able

14:47.520 --> 14:49.189
to deny that we
still belong together.

14:49.189 --> 14:52.225
BRICK:
That is just great...

14:52.225 --> 14:53.660
Does the wall
have a murmur?

14:54.694 --> 14:56.396
I was just listening

14:56.396 --> 14:59.699
to a crazy termite
hatching a crazy plan

14:59.699 --> 15:01.501
that absolutely will not work.

15:01.501 --> 15:03.436
Okay. Well, do you need
to listen anymore?

15:03.436 --> 15:05.939
Because we were supposed
to go talk to my mom.

15:05.939 --> 15:07.507
Right. I'm coming.

15:10.677 --> 15:12.812
Stupid Zoe Hart.

15:12.812 --> 15:14.347
It's her loss,

15:14.347 --> 15:17.384
because you're gonna
win that prize money, I'm sure.

15:17.384 --> 15:19.219
You always got my back, Tans.

15:19.219 --> 15:21.388
You know how
I'm gonna thank you?

15:21.388 --> 15:25.225
I'm gonna take 30 bucks
out of that five K tomorrow,

15:25.225 --> 15:27.860
and I'm gonna take you
for dinner after the race.

15:27.860 --> 15:29.629
Why don't I cook dinner for you?

15:29.629 --> 15:32.232
Just in case.

15:32.232 --> 15:33.766
Well, all right, then.

15:33.766 --> 15:36.303
My place it is.

15:36.303 --> 15:38.038
(laughs)

15:38.038 --> 15:39.906
WOMAN:
Hi, baby.

15:39.906 --> 15:41.174
Hi.

15:41.174 --> 15:43.443
Zoe, it's nice
to see you.
You, too.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.645
Are you gonna be
joining us for dinner?

15:45.645 --> 15:46.746
Oh, no, thanks.

15:46.746 --> 15:48.982
I actually just want
to talk to you about Rose.

15:48.982 --> 15:51.951
Oh, no! She doesn't have one
of those teenage scary things

15:51.951 --> 15:53.320
that I've seen on The View?

15:53.320 --> 15:56.656
Um, texting thumb,
or-or tanorexia?

15:56.656 --> 15:58.591
No, no. I'm-I'm fine.

15:58.591 --> 15:59.592
She's fine.

15:59.592 --> 16:01.461
It's just
that this lovely young man

16:01.461 --> 16:04.664
named Frederick Dean has asked
young Rose out on a date.

16:04.664 --> 16:05.932
I know technically

16:05.932 --> 16:07.400
she isn't allowed
till her birthday,

16:07.400 --> 16:10.937
but I thought maybe you would
consider reconsidering.

16:10.937 --> 16:14.474
He seems like a nice boy.

16:15.542 --> 16:16.509
But a rule is a rule.

16:17.544 --> 16:19.312
ZOE:
But you know,

16:19.312 --> 16:23.016
what if Frederick and Rose
did the race tomorrow?

16:23.016 --> 16:24.184
It's not a date,

16:24.184 --> 16:25.918
and it is a fitness activity,

16:25.918 --> 16:28.355
and it's completely in public.

16:28.355 --> 16:32.192
Well, a race sounds
pretty harmless.

16:33.160 --> 16:34.627
Fine. You win.

16:34.627 --> 16:35.762
Thanks, Mom.

16:35.762 --> 16:37.897
All right, well,
I'm gonna get us some menus.

16:37.897 --> 16:39.232
You know, I love this place,

16:39.232 --> 16:41.668
but the service is never
really more than a six.

16:41.668 --> 16:43.436
A race? Really?

16:43.436 --> 16:46.339
That's not what I had in
mind for my first date.

16:46.339 --> 16:47.574
This is gonna be better!

16:47.574 --> 16:50.110
You know, I used to do
this kind of stuff.

16:50.110 --> 16:52.445
My mom would send me
to sleepaway camp, you know.

16:52.445 --> 16:55.014
The stakes were high,
it was fun, but so intense.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.517
You couldn't help but deeply
connect with your partner.

16:57.517 --> 17:01.454
That's how a lot
of camp love affairs started.

17:02.389 --> 17:04.523
I guess you're right.

17:04.523 --> 17:07.160
I need to go take care
of something.

17:08.395 --> 17:09.796
(clears throat)
Hi.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.298
What?

17:11.298 --> 17:14.967
Do you still need a partner
for that race thing tomorrow?

17:14.967 --> 17:16.536
'Cause I was
thinking it actually

17:16.536 --> 17:19.539
might be a good way for me
to drum up some patients.

17:19.539 --> 17:21.674
I don't know.
I'll let you keep
all the money.

17:21.674 --> 17:23.143
Done.
Great.

17:23.143 --> 17:25.178
Believe me, Wade Kinsella,

17:25.178 --> 17:27.446
we are going
to win everything we want.

17:32.018 --> 17:34.221
(crowd chatter)

17:39.092 --> 17:41.628
George, thank you again
for doing this for me.

17:45.031 --> 17:47.033
LAVON:
Zoe,

17:47.033 --> 17:48.168
what are you doing here?

17:48.168 --> 17:49.436
I'm limbering up.

17:49.436 --> 17:50.703
Don't want to
pull a hammy.

17:50.703 --> 17:52.172
Why are you in this race?

17:52.172 --> 17:54.774
Because I can't let Lemon

17:54.774 --> 17:57.277
just weasel her way back
into George's heart.

17:57.277 --> 17:59.412
I need to show George that
I am in this race, too.

17:59.412 --> 18:03.416
So, that's why
I am joining the race.

18:03.416 --> 18:04.717
It's a huge
gesture, Lavon!

18:04.717 --> 18:07.187
There's no way
George could miss it.

18:07.187 --> 18:09.021
No comment.

18:09.021 --> 18:13.326
BRICK (over microphone):
Attention!

18:13.326 --> 18:15.528
Attention, ladies
and gentlemen.

18:15.528 --> 18:19.932
It's a great pleasure for me
to welcome everyone to our own

18:19.932 --> 18:21.134
BlueBell Battle!

18:21.134 --> 18:23.470
(applause, cheering
and whooping)

18:23.470 --> 18:26.339
A series of challenges
that will test y'all

18:26.339 --> 18:28.208
like you've never been
tested before.

18:28.208 --> 18:30.810
And to the last team standing

18:30.810 --> 18:34.113
goes the coveted Golden Bell

18:34.113 --> 18:35.982
and $5,000.

18:35.982 --> 18:37.784
(applause and cheering)

18:37.784 --> 18:40.753
(Wade trills)

18:40.753 --> 18:42.155
Is everyone ready?

18:42.155 --> 18:43.089
Yeah.

18:43.089 --> 18:44.090
Teams, on your mark.

18:44.090 --> 18:46.259
(crowd chatter)

18:47.827 --> 18:49.929
And...

18:49.929 --> 18:51.598
Whoo!

18:52.832 --> 18:53.600
Go, go, go, go, go!

18:53.600 --> 18:55.768
(overlapping, excited chatter)

18:55.768 --> 18:57.003
(cheering)

18:57.003 --> 18:58.171
Go, go, go!

18:58.171 --> 19:00.173
So we have to assemble
the wheelbarrow,

19:00.173 --> 19:02.709
and then, the next clue
will be revealed.

19:02.709 --> 19:05.378
Manual labor isn't
really my thing.

19:05.378 --> 19:06.846
Dang instructions!

19:06.846 --> 19:08.114
How do you even unfold...?

19:08.114 --> 19:09.549
Oh, this might be the... Yup.

19:09.549 --> 19:11.418
There it is.
I unfolded 'em!

19:11.418 --> 19:13.520
Oh.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.154
It's just a standard model.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.257
Five and a half cubic
feet load capacity.

19:17.257 --> 19:18.991
Let's go with the
three-quarter-inch hex bolt

19:18.991 --> 19:20.159
and lock nut.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.628
You're like the girl
of my dreams,

19:21.628 --> 19:24.597
and the girl I made on
my computer all rolled into one.

19:26.533 --> 19:28.668
LEMON:
See, this
isn't so bad.

19:28.668 --> 19:31.571
It's such a
beautiful day!

19:32.772 --> 19:34.641
It is just so nice

19:34.641 --> 19:37.410
when two people can work
together in quiet

19:37.410 --> 19:39.679
without all those pesky words.

19:43.049 --> 19:44.584
What are you doing?!

19:44.584 --> 19:46.753
The instructions say
to do that part later.

19:46.753 --> 19:47.954
See? In Diagram 8H.

19:47.954 --> 19:50.423
I don't do instructions,
all right, Doc?

19:50.423 --> 19:52.892
Wade!
Just give me
a sec, okay?

19:52.892 --> 19:54.160
Oh... Shoot!

19:54.160 --> 19:56.363
I cannot believe you!

19:56.363 --> 19:59.065
I was doing fine until...
until you come in here

19:59.065 --> 20:01.534
with all your buzzing and
your bossing in my ear,

20:01.534 --> 20:03.536
and suddenly, suddenly,
I'm distracted.

20:03.536 --> 20:07.440
(whooping and applause)

20:07.440 --> 20:09.075
We have to stop fighting, okay?

20:09.075 --> 20:10.443
It's not getting us anywhere.

20:10.443 --> 20:12.211
Neither is this
wheelbarrow.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.715
LAVON:
 Hey, Tansy.

20:15.715 --> 20:18.050
Uh, come on in.
Come on in.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.586
I'm sorry to bother you.

20:19.586 --> 20:21.454
I was gonna make Wade
dinner tonight,

20:21.454 --> 20:23.089
but his spice rack is basically

20:23.089 --> 20:24.357
just some take-out
ketchup packets

20:24.357 --> 20:26.826
and what hopefully
were old raisins.

20:26.826 --> 20:30.062
I was wondering if I could
borrow your kitchen for a bit?

20:30.062 --> 20:31.798
Oh, no problem.
Okay.

20:31.798 --> 20:33.132
Happy for the company.

20:33.132 --> 20:35.402
Laid up here
on injured reserve, so...

20:35.402 --> 20:38.638
So, uh, you

20:38.638 --> 20:41.841
and, uh, Wade and dinner?

20:41.841 --> 20:43.643
Does that mean...?

20:43.643 --> 20:46.879
He does really seem
to want to change.

20:46.879 --> 20:49.682
Let's just hope wanting
is the same as doing.

20:49.682 --> 20:51.217
I hear that.

20:51.217 --> 20:52.385
So, what you making?

20:52.385 --> 20:54.186
Chicken and
mashed potatoes.
Hmm.

20:54.186 --> 20:56.088
But I want to make
a real fancy dessert,

20:56.088 --> 20:59.191
like a parfait or a
soufflÃ©, crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e?

20:59.191 --> 21:00.393
I don't know. Something "A."

21:00.393 --> 21:02.028
I really want
to make it special.

21:02.028 --> 21:09.035
Tansy, please don't take this
the wrong way, but, uh...

21:09.035 --> 21:10.837
have you ever cooked before?

21:10.837 --> 21:14.173
I'm kind of a take-out,
ketchup kind of girl myself.

21:14.173 --> 21:15.542
Ah. (laughs)

21:15.542 --> 21:17.377
Would you care for some help?

21:17.377 --> 21:18.578
Only on the dessert.

21:18.578 --> 21:20.847
Okay.
And the entree.

21:20.847 --> 21:22.849
Okay.

21:26.786 --> 21:29.989
Okay, Zoe and Wade, welcome
to Challenge Number Four.

21:29.989 --> 21:32.258
This is a multi-step event,
and you better get cracking,

21:32.258 --> 21:33.526
'cause you're in eighth place!

21:33.526 --> 21:34.861
All right,
let's go!

21:39.332 --> 21:41.468
Doc, what are you doing?
Hurry up.

21:45.472 --> 21:47.273
Oh, Rose, Frederick,

21:47.273 --> 21:50.142
I hate to tell you this,
but you're the last to arrive.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.277
That means you're out.

21:51.277 --> 21:53.480
After only three events?
Darn it!

21:53.480 --> 21:55.482
Yeah, shoot.

21:55.482 --> 21:58.785
Hey, want to go to The Dixie
Stop and get a milkshake?

21:58.785 --> 22:00.387
Okay!

22:02.188 --> 22:04.957
ZOE:
So why is this prize money
so important to you anyway?

22:04.957 --> 22:07.694
You're gonna
think it's stupid.
No, I won't.

22:07.694 --> 22:09.529
I want to open
my own bar.

22:09.529 --> 22:12.198
I was gonna use the
5K to start it up.

22:12.198 --> 22:13.566
And, uh, you know...

22:13.566 --> 22:16.135
with a little luck, maybe
turn it into something.

22:16.135 --> 22:17.269
Go ahead. Laugh.

22:17.269 --> 22:19.005
Why would I
laugh at that?

22:19.005 --> 22:21.173
I think that's a really
good idea, Wade.

22:21.173 --> 22:22.709
Good for you.

22:30.450 --> 22:31.484
See, look at us.

22:31.484 --> 22:32.719
The minister was right.

22:32.719 --> 22:34.587
We have what it takes;
we're winning.

22:34.587 --> 22:37.123
That just proves that
we can do anything if we try.

22:37.123 --> 22:38.891
Look, all it proves
is that I'm motivated

22:38.891 --> 22:41.127
to have this race end
as quickly as possible.
But George,

22:41.127 --> 22:43.129
I mean, you can't deny
that we're still...

22:43.129 --> 22:44.564
we're us.

22:44.564 --> 22:46.566
Lemon, the us that you knew
doesn't exist anymore.

22:46.566 --> 22:49.869
I know that, but...
And the fact that we make
a good Bluebell Battle team

22:49.869 --> 22:52.739
doesn't change the fact
that you had an affair...
I know that...

22:52.739 --> 22:56.142
or that I kissed
Zoe Hart in New Orleans.

23:01.881 --> 23:03.516
I'm gonna get some more corn.

23:11.323 --> 23:13.059
Hey, Wade...

23:13.059 --> 23:14.661
do, um, Southern men

23:14.661 --> 23:16.463
understand gestures?

23:16.463 --> 23:18.565
Oh, depends on the gesture,
I guess.

23:18.565 --> 23:21.033
Some of them, we get real well.

23:22.068 --> 23:23.636
Like this big Bluebell race.

23:23.636 --> 23:25.872
I mean, it's not
really my thing,

23:25.872 --> 23:26.839
yet I did it.

23:26.839 --> 23:28.174
That's a big deal, right?

23:28.174 --> 23:32.011
So, you didn't
do this to get patients?

23:32.011 --> 23:32.912
(laughs):
No.

23:33.946 --> 23:35.915
Look, uh...

23:35.915 --> 23:39.819
I-I think it's
still a little confusing.

23:41.120 --> 23:44.423
Men don't do subtle, Doc.

23:44.423 --> 23:46.258
I think you'd really better...

23:46.258 --> 23:48.595
spell it out clearly for us.

23:49.428 --> 23:51.363
You're right.

23:51.363 --> 23:52.999
Thanks, Wade.

23:54.033 --> 23:56.068
You're welcome.

23:58.805 --> 24:00.707
LAVON:
 Slice and bake cookies
 are genius.

24:00.707 --> 24:02.509
You slice, you bake, bam!

24:02.509 --> 24:04.276
I can handle that.

24:04.276 --> 24:05.845
And we got
a lot of wine.

24:05.845 --> 24:08.581
'Cause a lot of wine will
make any meal taste better.

24:08.581 --> 24:10.717
TANSY:
Wade!

24:10.717 --> 24:12.284
How's it going?
Hey, w-we're

24:12.284 --> 24:13.686
coming on strong.

24:13.686 --> 24:16.556
Uh, Tans, I got to cancel
the dinner plans tonight.

24:16.556 --> 24:17.957
I'm sorry, but,
uh, you know,

24:17.957 --> 24:19.559
there's like this
after party thing

24:19.559 --> 24:21.227
for all the contestants
at the Rammer Jammer.

24:21.227 --> 24:23.663
So, you know, I should be there,
as the winner.

24:23.663 --> 24:25.698
(laughs)
Uh, rain check?

24:25.698 --> 24:27.333
No biggie. Good luck.

24:27.333 --> 24:28.400
All right. Thanks.

24:28.400 --> 24:30.202
I'll see you
guys later. Bye.

24:30.202 --> 24:31.638
(quiet laugh)

24:31.638 --> 24:32.872
WADE:
Thank you, miss.

24:32.872 --> 24:34.907
Chop sticks,
extra napkins.
Hey.

24:35.975 --> 24:38.611
Why'd cancel on Tansy like that?
Lavon,

24:38.611 --> 24:40.980
something is happening with Zoe.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.715
I don't know exactly
how to explain it.

24:42.715 --> 24:45.351
But it's like finally
we're clicking.

24:45.351 --> 24:46.418
You and Zoe?

24:46.418 --> 24:48.454
I-I know. I know
it sounds crazy,

24:48.454 --> 24:50.356
but trust me, all right?

24:50.356 --> 24:51.591
All right, wish me luck.

24:51.591 --> 24:52.892
All right.

24:52.892 --> 24:54.627
All right, I'll
see you later. Bye.

24:54.627 --> 24:57.730
Wish me luck!

25:00.332 --> 25:02.201
WADE:
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

25:04.470 --> 25:06.539
Good luck.

25:09.441 --> 25:10.777
Whoa, Doc. You sewed that fast.

25:10.777 --> 25:12.244
Fastest whip stitch
in three counties.

25:12.244 --> 25:14.581
Don't slow down now.
I got to get more hay.

25:14.581 --> 25:17.684
I'll be right back.
Okay.

25:18.785 --> 25:19.686
Zoe,

25:19.686 --> 25:21.053
Hey.
I need to talk to you.

25:21.053 --> 25:22.855
I-I know you're
trying to make some...

25:22.855 --> 25:25.224
big gesture to George
by competing in this race...

25:25.224 --> 25:27.594
I know what you're gonna say,
and I totally agree.

25:27.594 --> 25:28.961
That was a crazy plan.

25:29.996 --> 25:31.731
Yes, it was.

25:31.731 --> 25:33.933
I'm, uh, glad
you see that 'cause...

25:33.933 --> 25:35.668
'Cause a gesture
isn't gonna be enough.

25:35.668 --> 25:37.369
George won't know
how I feel

25:37.369 --> 25:40.072
unless I spell it out for him,
so the first moment he's alone,

25:40.072 --> 25:41.741
I'm gonna lay it
all on the line.

25:41.741 --> 25:44.677
Look, Zoe, I know
how you feel about George,

25:44.677 --> 25:47.079
but you're in this contest
with Wade.

25:47.079 --> 25:48.881
I don't want to see him
get hurt.

25:48.881 --> 25:50.149
Why would he get hurt?

25:50.149 --> 25:51.851
We are working
so well together today.

25:51.851 --> 25:54.053
We might even win
the money for his bar.

25:54.053 --> 25:56.122
Zoe...

25:56.122 --> 25:58.958
I-I really don't get
how you still don't know this.

25:58.958 --> 26:00.526
But Wade...

26:00.526 --> 26:02.461
likes you.

26:02.461 --> 26:03.896
What?!

26:03.896 --> 26:06.666
No. Okay, maybe, maybe
he did before,

26:06.666 --> 26:08.735
but not anymore--
definitely not.

26:08.735 --> 26:10.469
Just be careful
'cause he's a good guy.

26:10.469 --> 26:11.671
And he really has no clue

26:11.671 --> 26:12.939
that you're
only working with him

26:12.939 --> 26:14.306
to get to someone else.

26:14.306 --> 26:16.575
WADE:
Hey, Doc! Doc!

26:16.575 --> 26:17.777
You'll never believe it.

26:17.777 --> 26:19.411
Ben and Babs Foster, donezo.

26:19.411 --> 26:20.647
You and me, third place.

26:20.647 --> 26:22.114
And it's all thanks
to your,

26:22.114 --> 26:24.350
you know,
quick surgeon sewing.

26:26.452 --> 26:28.254
See y'all later.

26:28.254 --> 26:30.222
WADE:
All right.

26:34.827 --> 26:37.096
(loud slurping)

26:37.096 --> 26:39.165
Hey,

26:39.165 --> 26:41.768
did you know that
astronauts can't belch?

26:41.768 --> 26:44.103
Well, in space.

26:44.103 --> 26:45.905
On land, they can.

26:45.905 --> 26:48.207
You gonna drink that shake?

26:50.209 --> 26:51.878
Okay.

26:51.878 --> 26:54.380
It's a really nice night,
isn't it?

26:54.380 --> 26:56.515
Look how clear that sky is.

26:56.515 --> 26:58.384
Yeah.

26:58.384 --> 26:59.686
Yeah, it is.

26:59.686 --> 27:01.921
Do you know what
this is a perfect night for?

27:01.921 --> 27:03.790
Taking a moonlight walk
and gazing at the stars?

27:03.790 --> 27:04.891
Night fishing.

27:04.891 --> 27:06.492
We should go to
Old Babcock Pond.

27:06.492 --> 27:07.526
It'll be great.

27:07.526 --> 27:09.862
Night fishing?

27:09.862 --> 27:13.099
Sure. Yeah, let's go
catch some fish.

27:13.099 --> 27:15.134
(loud slurping)
All right.

27:18.270 --> 27:19.338
We have our rod.

27:19.338 --> 27:20.539
All we have to do now

27:20.539 --> 27:23.542
is use this to get the
magnetic fish off the church,

27:23.542 --> 27:25.277
and we win this
whole thing, Tom.

27:25.277 --> 27:27.446
Five thousand dollars.

27:27.446 --> 27:28.681
You did it!

27:28.681 --> 27:30.516
You did it all!

27:30.516 --> 27:33.052
I'm so sorry.

27:33.052 --> 27:35.021
I feel like I've hogged
all the activities.

27:35.021 --> 27:37.423
It's one downside
to being the only girl

27:37.423 --> 27:39.158
in a family of five boys.

27:40.192 --> 27:42.428
So this one...

27:42.428 --> 27:44.296
you should do.

27:44.296 --> 27:45.331
Me?

27:45.331 --> 27:46.699
Yeah.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.903
Me.

27:54.841 --> 27:57.409
I forgive you
for kissing Zoe Hart.

27:58.444 --> 27:59.678
You what?

27:59.678 --> 28:02.481
You were lashing out
because you were...

28:02.481 --> 28:03.850
hurt and you were angry.

28:03.850 --> 28:06.252
And it's...
it's understandable.

28:06.252 --> 28:07.686
You got to be kidding me.
What?

28:07.686 --> 28:08.988
George, please
just talk to me...

28:08.988 --> 28:10.456
I don't know, it's just,
you know,

28:10.456 --> 28:12.859
ever since Zoe gets to town,
you have been worried

28:12.859 --> 28:14.460
that something's
gonna happen between us.

28:14.460 --> 28:15.862
And then
I tell you that

28:15.862 --> 28:18.597
I kissed her...

28:18.597 --> 28:20.566
and you don't care.

28:20.566 --> 28:22.034
What?! No.

28:22.034 --> 28:24.236
I didn't say
I didn't care, George.
Lemon,

28:24.236 --> 28:25.905
are you so obsessed
we're having this wedding

28:25.905 --> 28:27.774
that you can't see
that we have real problems here?

28:27.774 --> 28:29.776
I am obsessed with the wedding

28:29.776 --> 28:31.978
because I want to marry you,
George.

28:31.978 --> 28:35.114
All right? I love you.
Yeah, all right. Guess what?

28:35.114 --> 28:36.148
Love...

28:36.148 --> 28:37.850
it ain't gonna
fix anything anymore.

28:37.850 --> 28:39.018
Because our
relationship

28:39.018 --> 28:41.220
should be just... it's...
(snap)

28:42.755 --> 28:44.356
It's broken.

28:49.261 --> 28:50.562
(quiet laugh)

28:50.562 --> 28:53.699
I don't want it to go
to your head or anything, but...

28:53.699 --> 28:55.301
I really appreciate
you being out here.

28:55.301 --> 28:57.970
I couldn't have made it
this far without you.

28:57.970 --> 28:59.972
Boy, you're
complimenting me?

28:59.972 --> 29:02.074
What, are you sick
or dying or something?

29:03.575 --> 29:07.646
Zoe, I think I need to
spell something out for you

29:07.646 --> 29:09.115
pretty clearly.

29:09.115 --> 29:10.282
Uh, well,

29:10.282 --> 29:13.252
I tried to take you
to the airport once

29:13.252 --> 29:14.420
to tell you there.

29:14.420 --> 29:17.924
I tried to tell you
a few different times, but...

29:19.158 --> 29:21.794
I guess I'm just gonna
come right out and say it.

29:21.794 --> 29:24.530
ROSE:
Zoe!

29:24.530 --> 29:26.032
I need you.
Rose,

29:26.032 --> 29:27.666
you're a little pale.
Is everything okay?

29:27.666 --> 29:29.068
ROSE:
No. Everything
is not okay.

29:29.068 --> 29:30.870
The date is going terribly.

29:30.870 --> 29:32.972
Fredrick Dean wants
to go to Old Babcock Pond

29:32.972 --> 29:34.073
to catch fish.

29:34.073 --> 29:35.908
Rose:
I'm wearing a new dress.

29:35.908 --> 29:37.376
Do I look like
I want to dig for worms?

29:37.376 --> 29:39.078
Ew. No.
I know!

29:39.078 --> 29:41.613
Um, hello.
Ladies, seriously?

29:41.613 --> 29:44.383
Old Babcock Pond is, like,
a legendary make out spot.

29:44.383 --> 29:46.819
Fredrick Dean asked you
to go there so he could,

29:46.819 --> 29:48.554
you know, get all up
in your tonsils.

29:48.554 --> 29:49.688
Oh, my God.

29:49.688 --> 29:51.190
Wait, are you serious?

29:51.190 --> 29:53.225
Zoe, I've never
kissed anyone before.

29:53.225 --> 29:55.527
No. I'm so nervous,
I feel sick.

29:55.527 --> 29:57.729
My stomach hurts so bad.

29:57.729 --> 29:58.831
I can't do this.

29:58.831 --> 30:00.532
Rose, those
are just butterflies.

30:00.532 --> 30:03.469
The question is, do you want
to kiss Fredrick Dean or not?

30:03.469 --> 30:05.004
Of course I do.

30:05.004 --> 30:06.438
Then go make it happen.

30:06.438 --> 30:07.706
Okay.

30:07.706 --> 30:10.209
All right. Okay.

30:10.209 --> 30:12.078
Okay!

30:12.078 --> 30:14.013
Whoa. Whoa.
Hey, hey, hey.

30:14.013 --> 30:16.115
WADE:
Hey, Tom Long

30:16.115 --> 30:17.583
is totally choking over there.

30:17.583 --> 30:19.852
What if you...
I know.

30:19.852 --> 30:21.253
We have a chance
to actually win this thing.

30:21.253 --> 30:23.856
I need to go get
a Phillips Head screwdriver.

30:23.856 --> 30:25.992
I'll be, I'll be
right back. Okay?

30:25.992 --> 30:27.894
Hold on.
I'll be right back!

30:27.894 --> 30:30.029
George, where are you going?

30:31.763 --> 30:33.332
Tell the judges we're out.

30:33.332 --> 30:34.833
Our rod's broken.
We can't win now.

30:34.833 --> 30:36.035
Hey,

30:36.035 --> 30:39.538
don't you quit on me,
George Tucker.

30:39.538 --> 30:40.940
You may not love me right now,

30:40.940 --> 30:43.042
but I have enough love
for the both of us.

30:43.042 --> 30:44.410
Enough love to
get us through this

30:44.410 --> 30:45.945
until you can learn
to forgive me

30:45.945 --> 30:47.446
and love me again,
all right? All right,

30:47.446 --> 30:49.148
I'm not finished with you,
George.

30:49.148 --> 30:51.483
And I'm willing to do
anything that it takes

30:51.483 --> 30:52.484
to win you back.

30:58.024 --> 30:59.926
(whispers):
Now.

30:59.926 --> 31:02.094
Tell him now.

31:04.330 --> 31:06.232
Crap.

31:07.533 --> 31:09.001
ZOE:
George!

31:09.001 --> 31:10.436
Hey.
Hey.

31:10.436 --> 31:12.204
ZOE:
Look, here's the thing.

31:13.072 --> 31:15.041
I lied before.

31:15.041 --> 31:17.643
I don't want to be just friends.

31:17.643 --> 31:19.378
I joined this race

31:19.378 --> 31:21.080
to fight for you.

31:22.514 --> 31:24.050
(quiet laugh)

31:24.050 --> 31:25.784
Zoe...
I know.

31:25.784 --> 31:28.587
I know it's such bad timing...

31:28.587 --> 31:32.058
but I want you to know
that I'll wait for you.

31:33.592 --> 31:37.063
I'll wait, no matter
how long it takes.

31:37.063 --> 31:39.999
Just please don't
get back with Lemon.

31:41.533 --> 31:42.935
'Cause George...

31:42.935 --> 31:45.037
(nervous laugh)

31:45.037 --> 31:47.806
BRICK:
Lemon!

31:47.806 --> 31:50.509
BRICK:
Honey, what are you
doing up there? Come on down.

32:04.090 --> 32:05.924
BRICK: Lemon, Come on,
get down from there.

32:05.924 --> 32:07.126
You're gonna break your neck.

32:07.126 --> 32:08.961
No! I'm not
giving up on us, George.

32:08.961 --> 32:10.296
I'm gonna get that

32:10.296 --> 32:12.331
fish and we're gonna
win this race!

32:15.767 --> 32:17.970
ZOE:
Wade!

32:17.970 --> 32:19.538
50 screws and bolts

32:19.538 --> 32:21.640
all over the grass--
we're never gonna win now.

32:21.640 --> 32:23.075
Let me help you.

32:23.075 --> 32:24.443
No, just stop, okay?
Just stop!

32:24.443 --> 32:26.979
Forget about it.
There's no point, okay?

32:26.979 --> 32:28.580
There's no point!
It's over.

32:28.580 --> 32:31.050
And thank you for
costing me $5,000.

32:31.050 --> 32:32.351
Thank you for that.

32:33.152 --> 32:35.721
Wade, I-I'm so sorry.

32:37.256 --> 32:40.192
I cannot believe...

32:40.192 --> 32:42.428
that I didn't see this
from the beginning.

32:43.895 --> 32:45.431
You never wanted to help me.

32:45.431 --> 32:48.300
The only thing you wanted
was what you always do.

32:48.300 --> 32:50.036
Him.

32:50.036 --> 32:51.870
And you are...
you are so obsessed

32:51.870 --> 32:55.374
with getting what you want,
you don't care who you
hurt along the way.

32:55.374 --> 32:58.344
Well, let me tell you
something, Zoe Hart,

32:58.344 --> 33:01.080
George Tucker and Lemon Breeland
are getting married.

33:01.080 --> 33:03.482
That is how
 this story ends.

33:03.482 --> 33:07.253
Why does everyone in this town
see that but you?

33:11.190 --> 33:13.592
GEORGE:
Lemon, come on,
get down from there.

33:13.592 --> 33:15.427
You're starting
to give people a scare.

33:15.427 --> 33:17.796
(Lemon gasps)
GEORGE:
Lemon! Lemon!

33:17.796 --> 33:19.931
(gasps, laughs)

33:19.931 --> 33:22.134
LEMON:
George... I'm gonna fall.

33:22.134 --> 33:23.835
No, Lemon, listen to me,
you're not gonna fall.

33:23.835 --> 33:25.304
I think I'm gonna fall.
Just-just slide back

33:25.304 --> 33:26.605
towards the roof, okay?

33:26.605 --> 33:29.208
Just-just one step at a time;
you can do this.

33:29.208 --> 33:31.643
LEMON:
I can't move, George!
I can't move.

33:31.643 --> 33:33.079
Okay...

33:33.079 --> 33:34.480
okay, Lemon, you stay
right there, you hang on.

33:34.480 --> 33:35.747
I'm-I'm coming.
I'm coming.

33:35.747 --> 33:38.250
LEMON: Hurry, George!
George, hurry, please!

33:38.250 --> 33:40.552
(grunts)
Hurry!

33:42.721 --> 33:44.390
You know, most people
don't know it,

33:44.390 --> 33:46.358
but you actually catch
better fish at night.

33:46.358 --> 33:48.860
Particularly spotted
bass. And...

33:48.860 --> 33:50.396
spotted bass like
to eat worms...

33:50.396 --> 33:53.599
Oh, my gosh. Frederick,
I thought we were on a date.

33:54.733 --> 33:56.535
We are. Right?

33:56.535 --> 33:59.371
Then why are we talking
about fish and worms?

34:00.606 --> 34:03.375
I-I thought you liked
science, and...

34:03.375 --> 34:05.844
I wanted you to know
I respect you,

34:05.844 --> 34:08.246
as a woman.

34:08.246 --> 34:09.947
I didn't want you
to think I just

34:09.947 --> 34:12.684
wanted to take you out here
to kiss you or something.

34:12.684 --> 34:14.985
But we're on a date,
and I've been sitting here

34:14.985 --> 34:17.789
all night with a stomachache
waiting for you to kiss me.

34:19.158 --> 34:20.592
Really?

34:20.592 --> 34:21.726
Yeah.

34:26.165 --> 34:28.134
(sobbing)
Okay, Lemon,
I'm here.

34:28.134 --> 34:30.302
I'm here. Okay.
George...

34:30.302 --> 34:32.971
All right, Lemon,
I'm right here.

34:32.971 --> 34:34.639
You feel my hand?

34:34.639 --> 34:35.841
Okay.
Okay.

34:35.841 --> 34:37.309
One step at a
time. Just...

34:37.309 --> 34:39.145
slide this way.

34:39.145 --> 34:40.179
Oh, God... (trembling)

34:40.179 --> 34:41.380
(sighs)

34:42.348 --> 34:43.915
Right in here.
All right.
Oh, God...

34:43.915 --> 34:45.150
GEORGE:
Come on.

34:45.150 --> 34:47.753
Come on.
(gasping breaths)

34:47.753 --> 34:49.721
(panting)

34:49.721 --> 34:51.223
George, the fish.

34:53.192 --> 34:55.327
(laughs)

34:56.795 --> 35:00.031
(panting)

35:00.031 --> 35:02.901
* *

35:02.901 --> 35:05.070
He's going...

35:05.070 --> 35:07.173
he's going
for the fish.

35:07.173 --> 35:08.474
George?

35:08.474 --> 35:11.076
* *

35:11.076 --> 35:14.380
(cheering, applause)

35:15.214 --> 35:17.349
Come on...

35:17.349 --> 35:19.285
(grunts)
Okay.

35:20.419 --> 35:22.688
(crowd chatter, whooping)

35:22.688 --> 35:24.156
(laughing)

35:28.327 --> 35:30.496
(Lemon laughing,
talking indistinctly)

35:30.496 --> 35:32.564
* *

35:39.705 --> 35:42.341
So, I hear the race
was pretty interesting.

35:43.842 --> 35:46.545
Yeah.
(chuckles)

35:46.545 --> 35:47.879
Okay.

35:47.879 --> 35:51.183
There might be still be
something between us.

35:51.183 --> 35:52.951
Maybe. I...

35:52.951 --> 35:55.153
Look, George...

35:56.955 --> 36:00.926
Lemon made a mistake, and she's
gonna continue to make them,

36:00.926 --> 36:02.261
as will you.

36:02.261 --> 36:03.629
So I ask you, now,

36:03.629 --> 36:06.097
when you saw her
up on that roof,

36:06.097 --> 36:08.300
what were you thinking?

36:11.036 --> 36:12.604
I was just thinking,

36:12.604 --> 36:15.474
uh...

36:15.474 --> 36:19.110
"Please, God, do not let
anything happen to her."

36:19.110 --> 36:21.780
Because if something
did, then...

36:22.814 --> 36:24.683
(laughs softly)

36:26.318 --> 36:28.520
* *

36:34.059 --> 36:36.061
I'm sorry I let you down.

36:36.061 --> 36:37.396
I choked.

36:37.396 --> 36:39.331
I'm a choking hazard.

36:41.066 --> 36:43.369
You didn't let me down, Tom.

36:43.369 --> 36:45.537
I didn't care about the race.

36:45.537 --> 36:49.140
I just wanted to be with you.

36:49.140 --> 36:51.209
Really?

36:51.209 --> 36:53.279
Yes, really!

36:53.279 --> 36:55.647
I think you're wonderful...

36:55.647 --> 36:57.449
Tom Long.

37:00.118 --> 37:03.555
* *

37:12.764 --> 37:14.500
Hey.
Hey.

37:16.101 --> 37:20.205
I just wanted to thank you
for everything tonight.

37:20.205 --> 37:21.340
And...

37:21.340 --> 37:22.741
to say good-bye.

37:22.741 --> 37:25.777
I'm not gonna be hanging out
in BlueBell anymore.

37:25.777 --> 37:26.912
Wha... Really?

37:26.912 --> 37:30.482
Come on, Lavon, I know
why Wade canceled on me.

37:30.482 --> 37:32.050
It's my fault.

37:32.050 --> 37:35.454
I'm the one who suggested
Wade ask Zoe to be his partner.

37:35.454 --> 37:37.289
I think I did it to see

37:37.289 --> 37:39.024
how he felt about her.

37:39.024 --> 37:41.893
And... now I know.

37:42.994 --> 37:45.731
Well, Tans, I have suffered
the same ailment--

37:45.731 --> 37:49.901
wanting someone who...
simply is not good for me.

37:49.901 --> 37:52.471
(snaps fingers)
But... I can help you.

37:52.471 --> 37:54.773
Okay?
Well... how?

37:58.610 --> 38:00.479
Make a list of
every reason

38:00.479 --> 38:02.414
you and Wade should
not be together.

38:02.414 --> 38:03.615
All right?

38:03.615 --> 38:05.016
Okay.

38:05.016 --> 38:07.018
(clears throat softly)

38:08.219 --> 38:10.822
"Emotionally unavailable...

38:10.822 --> 38:12.223
"rigid and icy,

38:12.223 --> 38:13.392
doesn't like
to cuddle..."

38:13.392 --> 38:14.693
Oh, oh... (chuckles)

38:14.693 --> 38:16.695
Sorry. That's mine. Heh.

38:16.695 --> 38:19.498
(clears throat)
(giggles)

38:20.699 --> 38:21.500
Yeah.

38:21.500 --> 38:24.069
There. Go on,
purge away.

38:24.069 --> 38:25.537
Okay.

38:26.472 --> 38:29.007
One-- Insensitive.

38:29.007 --> 38:30.609
Good.
Two--

38:30.609 --> 38:32.644
Bad taste in movies.

38:32.644 --> 38:34.079
That's a good one.

38:34.079 --> 38:37.649
Yeah, I'm gonna
add that one to my list.
Okay.

38:37.649 --> 38:38.817
Three--

38:38.817 --> 38:41.252
Immature.

38:41.252 --> 38:42.588
(door closes)

38:43.389 --> 38:45.123
Hey, Wade.

38:45.123 --> 38:47.258
You okay?
Tansy,

38:47.258 --> 38:49.728
I am so sorry
I cancelled on you.

38:51.563 --> 38:52.664
What are y'all writing?

38:52.664 --> 38:53.999
A list of your
negative qualities.

38:53.999 --> 38:56.802
Gonna help me get over
you once and for all.

38:56.802 --> 39:00.271
12-- Your bathroom
is disgusting.

39:00.271 --> 39:00.972
Mm.

39:00.972 --> 39:02.273
13) Your socks

39:02.273 --> 39:03.642
are everywhere!

39:03.642 --> 39:05.411
Hey, that's just 'cause
I have a hard time

39:05.411 --> 39:07.278
finding the right
match. Now, hold...

39:07.278 --> 39:09.481
This is mean.

39:09.481 --> 39:11.216
Yeah, but it really works.

39:11.216 --> 39:12.418
(chuckles):
Yeah.

39:12.418 --> 39:14.886
Give me a notebook.

39:15.887 --> 39:17.956
Well, all right.

39:17.956 --> 39:20.792
Let's get this
purging party started.

39:20.792 --> 39:23.094
(chuckles)

39:23.094 --> 39:25.964
(clears throat)

39:25.964 --> 39:27.966
Selfish.

39:29.300 --> 39:31.169
Stupid shorts.

39:31.169 --> 39:33.405
(knocking)

39:33.405 --> 39:37.108
* *

39:37.108 --> 39:39.377
Hey. Can I...?
Hey.

39:39.377 --> 39:41.312
Sure.

39:41.312 --> 39:43.314
* *

39:43.314 --> 39:44.783
Uh...

39:46.485 --> 39:47.719
Zoe, look...

39:47.719 --> 39:50.922
You don't have to say it.

39:50.922 --> 39:52.591
I know. I saw.

39:52.591 --> 39:55.126
You're getting back
together with Lemon.

39:56.127 --> 39:57.796
Yeah, and I know

39:57.796 --> 40:00.331
it probably seems insane...

40:00.331 --> 40:02.668
George... it's fine.

40:04.436 --> 40:06.905
You made your choice.

40:08.206 --> 40:10.942
It's just that, um...

40:10.942 --> 40:13.411
Lemon...

40:13.411 --> 40:15.346
she's a part of me,

40:15.346 --> 40:20.185
and we owe it to each other
to try and make this thing work.

40:20.185 --> 40:23.054
Because you love her?

40:26.758 --> 40:28.960
That's the thing.

40:28.960 --> 40:30.762
I do.

40:31.597 --> 40:33.499
ZOE:
 It's horrible,

40:33.499 --> 40:35.000
Lavon!

40:36.034 --> 40:37.969
Oh, hey, Tansy.

40:38.737 --> 40:40.506
Wade, I am so sorry.

40:40.506 --> 40:44.476
Zoe, I-I'm sorry, we're right
in the middle of something.

40:44.476 --> 40:46.044
Now, I told you
how he felt,

40:46.044 --> 40:48.480
and I told you not
to mess with him.

40:48.480 --> 40:50.582
Couldn't have
been more clear.

40:50.582 --> 40:52.851
Y-You can't be here

40:52.851 --> 40:55.487
right now.

40:55.487 --> 40:57.689
* *

41:01.326 --> 41:03.629
(phone rings)

41:07.198 --> 41:09.601
Brick, is everything okay?

41:11.503 --> 41:13.705
* *

41:15.106 --> 41:16.174
Okay, thanks.

41:16.174 --> 41:17.308
Hey.
Hey.

41:17.308 --> 41:19.210
Apparently, she was
in the woods with Frederick,

41:19.210 --> 41:21.146
she complained of stomachache,
and then she collapsed.

41:21.146 --> 41:23.715
He carried her
all the way back here.
Her appendix?

41:23.715 --> 41:27.018
Yeah, Zoe, it burst.
Oh, my God.

41:27.018 --> 41:28.654
Rose, Annie,

41:28.654 --> 41:31.590
I'm here.
Oh, no, you are
not coming with us.

41:32.591 --> 41:34.325
I knew I shouldn't
have let her go

41:34.325 --> 41:35.727
on that date
with this boy tonight.

41:35.727 --> 41:37.262
You said she would be fine!

41:37.262 --> 41:39.264
(engine starts)

41:40.398 --> 41:42.500
(siren wailing)

41:43.969 --> 41:47.138
