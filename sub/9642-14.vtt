WEBVTT

00:03.166 --> 00:06.000
The Autumn Moon Feast
is a great werewolf holiday.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.583
We do this great ritual called
"Find the Squeaky Bone."

00:09.583 --> 00:11.250
Whoever finds it
gets to squeak it.

00:11.250 --> 00:13.458
I've squeaked it
five years in a row.

00:13.458 --> 00:16.458
In your face,
Uncle Walter.

00:16.458 --> 00:20.291
Well, let's go so I can
finally meet your parents.

00:20.291 --> 00:22.125
My parents?

00:22.125 --> 00:24.333
Uh... You know,
the Autumn Moon Feast

00:24.333 --> 00:25.625
is a stupid holiday.

00:25.625 --> 00:27.125
I'm not even
going this year.

00:27.125 --> 00:30.000
No, no, no, no, no.
The only stupid holidays

00:30.000 --> 00:31.875
are the ones where you
still have to go to school.

00:31.875 --> 00:34.208
Like Valentine's Day,
or St. Patrick's Day,

00:34.208 --> 00:35.208
or my birthday.

00:36.458 --> 00:37.958
Come on, I really want
to meet your parents.

00:37.958 --> 00:40.958
Oh, look. Magazines.

00:40.958 --> 00:43.458
When did they
put those there?

00:45.458 --> 00:48.208
I have a feeling that you
don't want me to meet them.

00:48.208 --> 00:51.333
Of course I want you
to meet them.

00:51.333 --> 00:52.750
It's just that
the family feast

00:52.750 --> 00:54.625
is no place to get
to know my parents.

00:54.625 --> 00:57.833
It's messy and it's loud
and my cousins have fleas.

00:57.833 --> 01:00.625
OK, well then, bring your
parents to the Sub Station.

01:00.625 --> 01:03.083
I mean, we still have fleas,
but at least it's quieter.

01:04.625 --> 01:06.875
Oh, I have a feeling
you're not gonna
take "no" for an answer.

01:06.875 --> 01:09.083
If more people
got that about me,

01:09.083 --> 01:10.583
life would be
so much easier for them.

02:03.458 --> 02:05.166
OK, that's it, Jerry.
We've cleared out

02:05.166 --> 02:07.708
- all the leftovers.
- Great. OK, Max.

02:07.708 --> 02:10.458
Come and get my "End of the
Week" breakfast scramble.

02:13.500 --> 02:16.458
Dad, I didn't even like
the food the first time around.

02:16.458 --> 02:18.416
Why do we have to
have it again?

02:18.416 --> 02:20.583
- Is that a sparerib?
- Ah!

02:20.583 --> 02:23.458
I already called it.

02:23.458 --> 02:25.875
Shouldn't a breakfast scramble
at least have an egg in it?

02:27.583 --> 02:29.625
Fine, I'll put an egg in it.

02:29.625 --> 02:31.250
Technically,
it's not a leftover,

02:31.250 --> 02:33.500
but the ones we have
are pretty old.

02:35.833 --> 02:39.375
Put my stomach in a good mood,
make this taste like kid food.

02:41.875 --> 02:43.250
OK, Max,
go get your brother.

02:43.250 --> 02:44.750
We have to eat this
while it's hot.

02:44.750 --> 02:46.000
Otherwise, it'll get cold

02:46.000 --> 02:47.375
and your Dad will put
whipped cream on it

02:47.375 --> 02:48.416
and make us eat it
for dessert.

02:48.416 --> 02:50.083
Mmm.

02:50.083 --> 02:52.291
This is delicious.
Grab me a plate.

02:52.291 --> 02:55.333
Mmm! It is delicious.
Forget the plate.

02:55.333 --> 02:57.000
Get me a Jerry-sized spoon.

02:59.458 --> 03:03.333
Where's breakfast?
I hear there's an egg in it.

03:03.333 --> 03:05.458
Egg.

03:05.458 --> 03:08.458
I got the egg,
I got the egg!

03:08.458 --> 03:12.166
Hey, that's my egg!
No fair, I saw it first.

03:12.166 --> 03:15.583
My egg!

03:16.833 --> 03:18.583
- Max!
- Don't touch me.

03:18.583 --> 03:20.333
What is going on?
Why are Mom and Dad

03:20.333 --> 03:21.708
acting like a bunch
of four-year-olds?

03:21.708 --> 03:23.208
Justin, I have no idea.

03:23.208 --> 03:25.583
I mean, it couldn't have had
anything to do with

03:25.583 --> 03:27.708
the kid food spell
I put in their breakfast.

03:27.708 --> 03:30.125
Cooties! Cooties!

03:30.125 --> 03:31.875
Oh, come on.
Kissy, kiss, kiss, kiss.

03:31.875 --> 03:33.958
You think it had nothing
to do with the spell?

03:33.958 --> 03:38.000
- Nah.
- Really?

03:39.500 --> 03:41.125
Well, now that you
asked me twice,

03:41.125 --> 03:42.833
I'm getting my suspicions.

03:42.833 --> 03:47.583
Just one little kiss.

03:49.208 --> 03:51.375
Well, looks like I'm gonna
have to fix this mess.

03:51.375 --> 03:53.000
Just like always.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
No, you don't.
I'm the one who's

03:55.000 --> 03:57.125
gonna be the family wizard,
not you.

03:57.125 --> 04:01.000
OK, family wizard, fine.
Good luck with it.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.083
Ew, ew, ew!

04:03.083 --> 04:06.333
I'm gonna kiss you!
One little kiss.

04:09.416 --> 04:13.583
Max did it.

04:13.583 --> 04:16.333
What? Dude, I swear
it wasn't me.

04:16.333 --> 04:18.375
I was talking to you
the whole time.
You saw me, right?

04:22.166 --> 04:23.875
OK, there she is.

04:23.875 --> 04:27.000
Now remember, you're my parents,
Grant and Linda.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.500
You're both British,
you were a ballerina,

04:29.500 --> 04:32.583
and you were a fighter pilot
in the Royal Navy.

04:32.583 --> 04:34.416
Yay, you're here!

04:34.416 --> 04:37.416
Alex, allow me to introduce
my mother and father.

04:37.416 --> 04:41.416
Hi, it's very nice to meet you,
Mr. and Mrs. Greybeck.

04:41.416 --> 04:43.583
I can see where Mason
gets his...

04:44.708 --> 04:46.875
...last name.

04:50.166 --> 04:52.291
Oh, my, Mason.

04:52.291 --> 04:54.458
Is this the lovely
lass of whom

04:54.458 --> 04:59.416
- you've been speaking about?
- Top o' the mornin' to ya.

04:59.416 --> 05:01.375
"Top o' the mornin'"?

05:01.375 --> 05:03.500
I didn't know that was
a British saying.

05:03.500 --> 05:05.833
Uh, correct. It's Irish.

05:05.833 --> 05:09.083
When I was a kid,
we lived in Dublin.

05:09.083 --> 05:11.958
Right, you have all the
backstory. Time to go.

05:11.958 --> 05:13.875
No, no, no, wait!
Wait, no.

05:13.875 --> 05:16.250
Please tell me about
when Mason was a kid.

05:16.250 --> 05:18.750
- Have a seat.
- Oh, uh...

05:18.750 --> 05:23.458
Well...
when he was a lad,

05:23.458 --> 05:26.416
he was, uh... small...

05:27.750 --> 05:32.166
...and, uh... young. Oh!

05:32.166 --> 05:35.875
It really hit me
how young he was.

05:37.708 --> 05:40.416
Isn't that right, Grant?

05:42.416 --> 05:43.416
Yeah.

05:45.083 --> 05:49.000
He was way younger than us.
Always has been.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.083
Why do you sound American
all of a sudden?

05:53.208 --> 05:57.375
I was a fighter pilot
in the Royal Navy.

05:59.583 --> 06:03.166
And I was a ballerina.

06:04.583 --> 06:06.583
Well, then, I'm glad
everyone met.

06:06.583 --> 06:08.750
Let's go, Mommy and Daddy.

06:10.625 --> 06:12.416
Oh, hey,
Bill and Molly.

06:12.416 --> 06:14.958
Why are you calling
Mason's parents Bill and Molly?

06:14.958 --> 06:18.833
- Well, this should be good.
- They're not his parents.

06:18.833 --> 06:20.583
They work at the craft store
down the street.

06:20.583 --> 06:23.416
You know, that one you call,
"Harper, hurry up!"

06:26.875 --> 06:28.416
What's going on here, Mason?

06:30.458 --> 06:32.166
I didn't want you to
meet my real parents,

06:32.166 --> 06:35.625
so I paid Bill and Molly
to pretend to be my parents.

06:35.625 --> 06:39.291
Uh, not yet, you didn't.

06:39.291 --> 06:41.708
You guys were terrible.
I'm not paying you.

06:41.708 --> 06:45.125
Yeah, you were pretty bad.
Let's go.

06:45.125 --> 06:48.250
Like he believed
you were a ballerina.

06:48.250 --> 06:50.375
Hey, that wasn't
my idea.

06:51.875 --> 06:53.458
I can't believe
you'd lie like that.

06:53.458 --> 06:55.625
I know, I'm sorry.

06:55.625 --> 06:57.750
It's just that my parents
are always very judgmental

06:57.750 --> 06:59.875
of my girlfriends. They've
never liked any of them.

06:59.875 --> 07:02.875
OK, well, that's no excuse
for faking your parents.

07:02.875 --> 07:04.833
It's not my fault you
dated a bunch of losers

07:04.833 --> 07:06.208
until you met me.

07:06.208 --> 07:08.416
Alex, I panicked.
I'm sorry.

07:08.416 --> 07:10.000
Well, sorry
isn't good enough.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.291
You are taking me to
the Autumn Moon Feast

07:12.291 --> 07:14.375
so your parents can see I'm
the best girlfriend ever.

07:17.875 --> 07:19.375
This is you.

07:19.375 --> 07:22.166
You look like throw up.

07:25.250 --> 07:28.583
Justin, good news.
I found a spell
I think is gonna work.

07:28.583 --> 07:30.125
It's the first thing
in the book.

07:30.125 --> 07:32.583
The "Table Contents."

07:32.583 --> 07:37.208
"Table of Contents"
is not a spell.

07:37.208 --> 07:39.958
Will you just admit
you need my help?

07:39.958 --> 07:43.000
I can fix this with just
one wave of the wand.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.875
Please, I got this
all under control.

07:46.875 --> 07:48.625
Ah!

07:50.708 --> 07:52.708
Yummy cookies
bring lots of cheers,

07:52.708 --> 07:55.208
gobble 'em up
and add some years.

07:55.208 --> 07:56.708
Who wants cookies?

07:56.708 --> 08:00.458
- Cookies!
- Cookie, cookie!

08:00.458 --> 08:02.375
Mmm!

08:08.833 --> 08:11.583
What are you guys staring at?
Do I have a zit?

08:13.500 --> 08:15.000
Ew.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.291
I'm gonna change my status
to say "not with her."

08:20.125 --> 08:23.375
Oh, don't break up with me.
I love you so much!

08:28.416 --> 08:30.958
I love you too, babe.
We're back together.

08:32.583 --> 08:35.000
Teenagers.
Yep, you're getting closer.

08:37.750 --> 08:39.625
Out of all the caves
in the world,

08:39.625 --> 08:41.750
your parents choose
the one in a sewer?

08:41.750 --> 08:44.083
It's under Manhattan.
It's worth a fortune.

08:47.583 --> 08:49.583
Well, this is
my parents' cave.

08:49.583 --> 08:51.083
Those are my parents
over there.

08:51.083 --> 08:53.583
- Oh.
- Hello, Son.

08:53.583 --> 08:56.250
Ah! And you must be Alex.

08:56.250 --> 08:58.000
Ah.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.958
- So nice to... meet you.
- Ah!

09:00.958 --> 09:03.333
- She smells clean.
- Yes.

09:03.333 --> 09:06.000
- Thank you.
- It's not a compliment.

09:06.000 --> 09:12.291
- Clearly, she's a bather.
- Oh. Well, don't worry.

09:12.291 --> 09:16.708
We'll find you something
to roll around in.

09:16.708 --> 09:18.458
And you...

09:18.458 --> 09:23.166
...smell... dreadful.

09:23.166 --> 09:26.333
I did fall in the sewer
on the way down, so...

09:26.333 --> 09:29.291
- Nice touch.
- Hi, I'm Harper.

09:29.291 --> 09:31.458
Very nice to
meet you, Harper.

09:31.458 --> 09:34.750
That is quite
a creative ensemble.

09:34.750 --> 09:37.416
I believe I recognize
a fellow crafter

09:37.416 --> 09:38.875
when I see one, eh?

09:38.875 --> 09:41.750
Well, look at that,
you totally hit it off.

09:41.750 --> 09:44.000
We should get going.
This has been a lovely feast.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.083
And there's the moon.
All done.

09:46.083 --> 09:47.458
Nonsense, Mason.

09:47.458 --> 09:50.375
This is the
Autumn Moon Feast.

09:50.375 --> 09:53.458
I have been crafting all week
for this celebration.

09:56.375 --> 09:59.166
- Would you like a tour?
- Definitely.

09:59.166 --> 10:00.166
Good, let's go.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.958
Your mother is so awesome.

10:03.958 --> 10:06.416
See, Mason?
We can't leave.

10:06.416 --> 10:08.375
This is your parents' chance
to really get to know me.

10:08.375 --> 10:10.458
Absolutely.
So, Alex,

10:10.458 --> 10:12.875
why don't you and your friend
wolf up like Mason here

10:12.875 --> 10:15.833
so we can get this
party started, eh, what?

10:18.000 --> 10:20.875
"Wolf up"?

10:20.875 --> 10:24.458
You told them
I'm a werewolf?

10:24.458 --> 10:29.166
Hmm. Yeah, see, I might
have mentioned that.

10:30.708 --> 10:35.000
Oh, look, they're serving
chipmunks and dip.

10:39.583 --> 10:43.083
Mason, why would you tell
your parents I'm a werewolf?

10:43.083 --> 10:46.166
- You just keep lying.
- I know. I'm sorry.

10:46.166 --> 10:49.458
The truth is my parents only
want me to date werewolf girls.

10:49.458 --> 10:51.375
OK, but you're not dating
a werewolf girl.

10:51.375 --> 10:53.458
You're dating a
smooth-skinned wizard.

10:54.958 --> 10:57.208
Wouldn't it be easier if you
just told them the truth?

10:58.375 --> 11:00.458
Unless you're
ashamed of me.

11:00.458 --> 11:02.875
Of course,
I'm not ashamed of you.

11:02.875 --> 11:04.708
But they won't understand.

11:04.708 --> 11:06.500
Please, just go with it.

11:06.500 --> 11:09.500
Use a spell to turn yourself
into a werewolf.

11:09.500 --> 11:11.875
So, you want me to pretend
to be someone I'm not,

11:11.875 --> 11:13.708
instead of just telling them
I'm a wizard.

11:15.291 --> 11:17.708
See how easy that sounded?

11:17.708 --> 11:22.125
OK. If this is how
you want it to be.

11:22.125 --> 11:24.958
Thank you, darling.

11:24.958 --> 11:29.000
Alex, OK. This place is
everything I hoped it would be.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Who knew that a simple,
red-headed girl

11:31.000 --> 11:33.708
born backstage at a
nightclub in Nebraska,

11:33.708 --> 11:37.416
could have so much in common
with a family of polite
British werewolves?

11:37.416 --> 11:39.250
Mason told his parents
I'm a werewolf.

11:39.250 --> 11:40.875
He lied again?

11:40.875 --> 11:44.708
Well, what are you
gonna do about it?

11:44.708 --> 11:46.291
If Mason wants a werewolf,

11:46.291 --> 11:48.083
I'm gonna give him
the best werewolf ever.

11:49.833 --> 11:51.583
Give us hair and fur,
and big ol' teeth,

11:51.583 --> 11:54.166
for sure.

11:58.583 --> 12:00.750
Oh, great.

12:00.750 --> 12:03.583
The sideburns I never wanted.

12:04.708 --> 12:06.625
Dad, that's my shirt.

12:06.625 --> 12:08.458
Not anymore.

12:08.458 --> 12:11.958
You teenagers are
surprisingly cruel.

12:13.833 --> 12:17.625
- Justin, I need your help.
- Wait. Need my help?

12:17.625 --> 12:20.083
The next all-powerful
Russo family wizard

12:20.083 --> 12:22.958
is admitting defeat?
I'm confused here.

12:22.958 --> 12:26.333
That's exactly right.
See, you're not confused at all.

12:26.333 --> 12:28.208
All right.
Fine, I'll help.

12:28.208 --> 12:30.083
It's actually
a very simple spell.

12:30.083 --> 12:34.208
I just gotta find my wand...
It's somewhere around here.

12:35.583 --> 12:37.166
It's fine,
you can just use mine.

12:37.166 --> 12:38.625
All right.

12:41.250 --> 12:42.833
Mine's gone, too.

12:44.833 --> 12:46.333
Mom?

12:47.583 --> 12:51.500
Dad. What did you do
with our wands?

12:51.500 --> 12:54.416
I don't know. What did
you do with our freedom?

12:56.708 --> 12:59.875
Yeah. I can't wait to get
a job and move out of here.

13:24.583 --> 13:27.083
OK.

13:28.875 --> 13:32.958
And that was our traditional
Autumn Moon Feast song,

13:32.958 --> 13:35.708
with a little extra chorus
from Alex.

13:35.708 --> 13:37.458
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

13:39.708 --> 13:41.458
Alex, sweetheart.

13:41.458 --> 13:43.458
No need to overdo it
with the werewolf stuff.

13:43.458 --> 13:46.125
Oh, I'm sorry,
do you want me to stop?

13:46.125 --> 13:47.958
Because I can take
my wand out right here,

13:47.958 --> 13:49.625
and un-werewolf myself
in front of everybody.

13:49.625 --> 13:51.375
No, no, werewolf on.

13:52.708 --> 13:56.833
And now, it's time
for our favorite ritual,

13:56.833 --> 13:59.708
"Find the Squeaky Bone."

13:59.708 --> 14:02.750
Whoever finds it,
gets to squeak it.

14:02.750 --> 14:05.291
Don't tell anyone,
dear, all right,

14:05.291 --> 14:07.333
but this year
as an added bonus,

14:07.333 --> 14:11.958
I marinated the squeaky bone
all day in reindeer guts.

14:11.958 --> 14:14.708
It's ever so festive.

14:17.708 --> 14:20.166
All right. Everyone ready?

14:20.166 --> 14:23.625
Let's...
Find... that... bone!

14:23.625 --> 14:26.000
I bet it's in here.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.583
- Nope, I was wrong.
- Alex, take it easy.

14:32.583 --> 14:35.458
Actually,
I knew it wasn't in there.

14:40.583 --> 14:42.875
Ooh! Maybe it's
in the feast.

14:54.166 --> 14:56.291
Well, now you're
not even looking.

14:56.291 --> 14:59.875
Well, of course I am!

14:59.875 --> 15:02.291
Just using my werewolf senses.

15:05.166 --> 15:08.333
Oh! There it is!

15:13.125 --> 15:17.458
Found it!

15:17.458 --> 15:20.083
Alex, my love,
what are you doing?

15:20.083 --> 15:22.500
You're embarrassing me
in front of my family.

15:22.500 --> 15:25.958
Oh, so you're embarrassed
if I am a werewolf,

15:25.958 --> 15:27.958
and you're embarrassed
if I'm not.

15:27.958 --> 15:30.000
What would you like me
to be for you, Mason?

15:42.416 --> 15:44.291
Mom, Dad.

15:44.291 --> 15:47.000
You need to tell me
where you put our wands.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
- Turn that off.
- Hey!

15:50.000 --> 15:52.125
This generation
of teenagers is mindless.

15:53.125 --> 15:54.750
Max!

15:54.750 --> 15:56.000
Where have you been?

15:56.000 --> 15:58.333
We are in the middle
of a teenage wasteland!

15:59.375 --> 16:01.708
Oh.

16:01.708 --> 16:04.458
Hey, Jer, there's
a party tonight at Talia's.

16:04.458 --> 16:07.958
- You want to go?
- Nah, she's lame.

16:07.958 --> 16:12.875
- Hey, that's my girlfriend.
- Yeah. That's why she's lame.

16:12.875 --> 16:14.458
Let's go anyway.

16:14.458 --> 16:18.708
Listen to me.
No one is going anywhere.

16:18.708 --> 16:21.291
You two are grounded.
You hear me?

16:21.291 --> 16:23.291
Listen to me.

16:23.291 --> 16:27.458
No one is going anywhere.
You two are grounded.

16:27.458 --> 16:28.583
You hear me?

16:28.583 --> 16:31.000
I'll tell you guys
what, OK?

16:31.000 --> 16:34.166
I'll make you a deal. Huh?
You give me the wands,

16:34.166 --> 16:36.583
and uh... I'll let you
go to the party tonight.

16:37.875 --> 16:40.875
Huh? Do we have a deal?

16:40.875 --> 16:42.208
- Fine.
- Whatever.

16:42.208 --> 16:43.416
Thank you.

16:43.416 --> 16:47.583
In the back pocket.
In the couch.

16:47.583 --> 16:49.083
- We didn't look very good.
- Unbelievable.

16:52.166 --> 16:54.875
All right, quick,
do the spell.

16:54.875 --> 16:56.083
Eat-sa, Eat-sa,
magic pizza.

16:56.083 --> 16:58.291
Change 'em back
from head to feetsa.

16:58.291 --> 17:00.458
Hey, guys, why don't you
come over here

17:00.458 --> 17:02.750
and grab a slice of pizza
before you go?

17:02.750 --> 17:04.291
- Oh.
- Cool.

17:04.291 --> 17:07.166
- Sure, thanks.
- Yeah, chow down.

17:07.166 --> 17:10.083
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

17:14.750 --> 17:21.166
What is this mess?!

17:21.166 --> 17:23.208
I don't know.

17:23.208 --> 17:25.375
But I'm pretty sure it has
something to do with

17:25.375 --> 17:28.583
those two teenagers.
Boys, clean this up.

17:30.500 --> 17:34.583
Ah. They grow up so fast.

17:36.500 --> 17:38.458
- Come on, go on then.
- Come on, girl!

17:38.458 --> 17:40.458
- She won't bite.
- Leave it! Leave it!

17:40.458 --> 17:42.833
- Leave it!
- Alex, give the bone back.

17:44.583 --> 17:46.875
There's a good girl.

17:46.875 --> 17:49.000
- Good girl.
- Mason...

17:49.000 --> 17:51.708
You never told us
Alex was like this.

17:51.708 --> 17:53.083
Like what?

17:53.083 --> 17:54.708
Really inappropriate and awful?

17:54.708 --> 17:56.625
I'm sorry, Mason,
I did what you wanted,

17:56.625 --> 17:58.208
and it looks like
it didn't work out.

17:58.208 --> 18:01.750
Alex. What are you
talking about?

18:01.750 --> 18:05.000
You've been a wonderful addition
to the Autumn Moon Feast.

18:05.000 --> 18:09.375
- What?
- Well, you embody everything

18:09.375 --> 18:11.625
to which us werewolves
should aspire.

18:11.625 --> 18:14.166
Vigor, enthusiasm.

18:14.166 --> 18:16.625
Werewolve-withall!

18:16.625 --> 18:19.875
Darling. In fact,
we would like to present

18:19.875 --> 18:22.333
this year's
"Horn of Plenty Award"

18:22.333 --> 18:26.083
to the Werewolf of
the Feast, Alex Russo!

18:26.083 --> 18:29.416
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

18:29.416 --> 18:32.250
Well done!

18:32.250 --> 18:34.833
As a matter of fact, Harper,

18:34.833 --> 18:37.166
why don't you
do the honors?

18:37.166 --> 18:42.708
- No. I'm OK.
- This is my masterpiece.

18:42.708 --> 18:49.291
This entire thing is made
out of dried sheep intestines.

18:49.291 --> 18:51.250
If you wanted to have
a little nibble,

18:51.250 --> 18:53.708
no one would blame you.
Try, go ahead.

18:53.708 --> 18:56.125
All right. That is...
That is it!

18:56.125 --> 18:59.125
You call this crafting,
I call it sick.

18:59.125 --> 19:01.625
You're all sick,
you people are sick! Sick!

19:03.708 --> 19:06.125
- Did you hear that, Grant?
- Yeah.

19:06.125 --> 19:08.583
- She called my craft "sick."
- Ah.

19:08.583 --> 19:11.125
But you know, that's what
the young people say these days

19:11.125 --> 19:15.625
- when they mean "good."
- Oh. Sick.

19:15.625 --> 19:17.166
Yes! Here, dear.

19:17.166 --> 19:19.000
- Sick.
- Yes!

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
- Sick.
- We're terribly sick.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.708
Alex, you did it.

19:24.708 --> 19:25.958
They love you.

19:25.958 --> 19:28.291
I knew you could
pull it off.

19:28.291 --> 19:30.708
Also, you have some
badger meat left in your hair.

19:30.708 --> 19:32.125
Mason, I want to go home.

19:32.125 --> 19:35.250
No, stay.
It worked out so well.

19:35.250 --> 19:37.375
Yeah, it worked out for you.

19:37.375 --> 19:39.875
I was the perfect werewolf
for you and your family,

19:39.875 --> 19:41.750
and now they have no idea
who I really am.

19:43.875 --> 19:45.375
Which seems to be
how you want it,

19:45.375 --> 19:47.458
so you were right,
I shouldn't have come.

19:47.458 --> 19:48.833
Alex, wait.

19:48.833 --> 19:51.333
There's nothing left
to say, Mason.

19:51.333 --> 19:53.458
No, there is.

19:55.625 --> 19:57.500
I want everybody to listen.

19:59.458 --> 20:01.583
Alex Russo
is not a werewolf.

20:04.250 --> 20:05.708
I only said she's a werewolf

20:05.708 --> 20:09.750
because I know that's
what you wanted to hear.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.250
And I was wrong to do that.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.750
Alex is a wizard.

20:18.375 --> 20:20.291
And I love her
with all my heart.

20:22.625 --> 20:25.166
Yes, it's very shocking.
We get it.

20:25.166 --> 20:28.458
Alex, please...

20:28.458 --> 20:30.458
Show them who
you really are.

20:54.500 --> 20:56.583
And as you can see,
she's a wonderful wizard

20:56.583 --> 21:00.333
that I can't live without.
I hope you can all accept us.

21:00.333 --> 21:03.291
Mason...

21:03.291 --> 21:06.708
Darling, do you mean to say
that you told your girlfriend

21:06.708 --> 21:09.875
to pretend to be a werewolf
because of us?

21:09.875 --> 21:13.166
Yes, I did. You've always
been so judgmental

21:13.166 --> 21:15.458
about me dating anyone
other than a werewolf.

21:15.458 --> 21:18.500
That's because it's easier
to date a werewolf, Son.

21:18.500 --> 21:20.708
Nobody understands werewolves
like other werewolves.

21:20.708 --> 21:22.208
- No.
- You're wrong.

21:22.208 --> 21:24.416
Alex understands me
better than anybody.

21:24.416 --> 21:26.583
Well, then, darling...

21:26.583 --> 21:30.000
If you're happy,
we're happy.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.583
Really?

21:31.583 --> 21:34.958
No. We're going to eat her.

21:36.500 --> 21:37.875
What?

21:37.875 --> 21:42.166
Well, she destroyed all the food
prepared for the feast.

21:42.166 --> 21:44.708
She's kind of left us
no choice, Son.

21:44.708 --> 21:47.000
- Really.
- We're starving.

21:50.208 --> 21:51.583
Go!

21:54.458 --> 21:58.166
And then he said,
"The nuts are complimentary."

22:05.166 --> 22:08.000
Alex, what's going on?

22:08.000 --> 22:11.875
Oh, well, since your
real parents want to eat me,

22:11.875 --> 22:14.208
I thought it'd be best if I
get to know your fake parents.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.166
So, you were saying?

22:17.166 --> 22:21.875
Boy, has he dated
some real dogs.

22:23.708 --> 22:26.875
I love your fake parents.
