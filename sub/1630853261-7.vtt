WEBVTT

00:07.799 --> 00:08.883
Listen.

00:08.967 --> 00:10.552
Before we get out,
I just want to say--

00:10.635 --> 00:12.220
Silent all the way
to the marina,

00:12.303 --> 00:14.264
and now she finally speaks.

00:14.347 --> 00:16.433
I didn't know what to say.
I just--

00:16.516 --> 00:18.435
Thank you for picking me up
and driving.

00:18.518 --> 00:20.311
I thought to myself,
"Hmm, Shane.

00:20.395 --> 00:22.564
You'd better show up."

00:22.647 --> 00:25.692
But also you outed me
as a CIA agent,

00:25.775 --> 00:27.652
to my boyfriend
while you were drunk.

00:27.736 --> 00:30.113
Oh, my God.
That was so bad...

00:30.196 --> 00:31.489
And then there's
this whole Megan thing.

00:31.573 --> 00:33.700
Honestly, I'm kind of on
the fence about our friendship.

00:33.783 --> 00:35.160
But I don't think
that you deserve

00:35.243 --> 00:37.162
to be framed for murder, so...

00:37.245 --> 00:40.373
Listen,
I'm not talking because...

00:41.458 --> 00:44.127
my entire family--well...

00:44.210 --> 00:45.795
what's left of it just,
like, imploded

00:45.879 --> 00:47.297
like a dying star overnight,

00:47.380 --> 00:49.758
and now I'm back
in this nightmare,

00:49.841 --> 00:52.635
but hurting you is, like,
the worst part of all of it.

00:52.719 --> 00:54.596
I do appreciate your apology.

00:54.679 --> 00:56.973
-Okay?
-Oh, thank you.

00:58.850 --> 01:00.810
Come on--what?
What, what, what?

01:00.894 --> 01:02.812
I did some digging.

01:02.896 --> 01:04.606
A lot of digging,
and I found out

01:04.689 --> 01:06.441
that everyone who has died

01:06.524 --> 01:08.818
has had contact with Will,

01:08.902 --> 01:10.695
the mark who was killed
in Berlin.

01:10.779 --> 01:12.530
Okay, well,
Benjamin is the one

01:12.614 --> 01:14.824
that tells me where to go,
so...

01:14.908 --> 01:16.493
Mr. Berry fought
to be your handler.

01:17.577 --> 01:18.995
That's Benjamin's errand boy.

01:19.078 --> 01:20.747
There's times I want to burn
the whole shit down.

01:20.830 --> 01:22.582
Do you think he fought
for me to be an asset

01:22.665 --> 01:24.751
so that he could, like,
pin all this shit on me?

01:24.834 --> 01:27.253
Like, building some sort of
fucked up case against me?

01:27.337 --> 01:29.547
Why would I kill these people?

01:29.631 --> 01:30.757
What would my motive even be?

01:30.840 --> 01:33.551
Honestly, I have no clue.

01:35.595 --> 01:37.597
Okay, so Max tracked down
the registration number.

01:37.680 --> 01:38.807
What the hell is a slip?

01:38.890 --> 01:42.018
Slips are parking spots
for boats.

01:42.101 --> 01:44.312
Okay, so...

01:44.395 --> 01:46.064
Wait, wait.

01:46.147 --> 01:47.398
This is the one.
This is the one.

01:48.900 --> 01:51.319
That's the same registration
number from the View-Master.

01:55.156 --> 01:56.699
- What?
-Shh.

02:04.249 --> 02:06.125
Mmm! Mm-mm. Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

02:11.256 --> 02:12.757
Wow.

02:12.841 --> 02:14.717
Don't touch anything.

02:17.095 --> 02:18.680
Oh!

02:22.350 --> 02:25.562
Oh, my God.

02:25.645 --> 02:28.022
I'm--Oh, my God,
I know that guy.

02:28.106 --> 02:29.691
That's--that's--that's--
that's the cloudy--

02:29.774 --> 02:31.234
That's the cloudy eye guy.
He works with Benjamin.

02:31.317 --> 02:32.694
-I saw him in Berlin.
-Wait, wait, wait.

02:32.777 --> 02:34.195
-He was in Berlin?
-Yes!

02:34.279 --> 02:35.697
What are you doing? What are
you doing? What are you doing?

02:35.780 --> 02:37.073
I need to call the police.

02:37.156 --> 02:39.492
This is a crime scene.
These bodies are in rigor.

02:39.576 --> 02:41.536
It means they were killed
within the last six hours.

02:41.619 --> 02:43.746
Okay, but maybe
there's like, a...surveillance

02:43.830 --> 02:45.081
around here that can help us
figure out what happened?

02:45.164 --> 02:46.416
No, no, no. See...

02:46.499 --> 02:50.503
CIA falls under
US Code Title 50.

02:50.587 --> 02:52.505
That's tracking people
with drones,

02:52.589 --> 02:55.675
That's hunting down North Korean
spies on airlines.

02:55.758 --> 02:57.927
Not this.
This is the police.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.262
-Okay?
-Okay.

02:59.345 --> 03:00.722
Look, I get that you're scared
right now, but,

03:00.805 --> 03:03.433
we gotta handle this
correctly.

03:03.516 --> 03:05.101
This can't be about you
right now.

03:29.375 --> 03:32.754
Shane's right. Why don't
we care about other people?

03:32.837 --> 03:35.214
I care. What do you mean?
I'm trying to stop all this.

03:35.298 --> 03:36.883
All you care about
is yourself.

03:36.966 --> 03:39.135
"Oh, my God,
someone's trying to frame me!"

03:39.218 --> 03:40.470
You won't shut up about it.

03:40.553 --> 03:41.804
No, no, I can stop this.

03:41.888 --> 03:43.264
I can make sure
no one else dies.

03:43.348 --> 03:46.142
Hmm. Isn't it such a shame
these people are dead

03:46.225 --> 03:47.810
because you're so stupid
you can't figure out

03:47.894 --> 03:49.520
a few clues on a View-Master?

03:55.068 --> 03:57.070
Oh, my God. Are these people
dead 'cause of me?

03:57.153 --> 03:58.655
They're dead 'cause of me,
aren't they?

03:58.738 --> 03:59.864
- They're dead 'cause of me.
-No, no, Cassie.

03:59.948 --> 04:01.574
-Is this my fault? Yes, it is.
-No, Cassie.

04:01.658 --> 04:03.242
-Cassie, no.
-Oh, my God.

04:03.326 --> 04:05.912
Oh! Fuck.

04:07.372 --> 04:09.165
That is my other red glove.

04:09.248 --> 04:10.375
That's my red glove
from Berlin!

04:10.458 --> 04:11.918
Benjamin found my other one
in Echo Park.

04:12.001 --> 04:13.586
That is mine. Oh, my God!

04:13.670 --> 04:14.837
-This is mine!
-No, stop, Cassie!

04:14.921 --> 04:16.506
Don't touch anything!

04:16.589 --> 04:18.132
Drop the glove.

04:33.773 --> 04:35.775
-Dot Karlson's office.
-Hi, this is Cassie Bowden.

04:35.858 --> 04:37.026
This is an emergency.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.361
Can you please put Dot on
right now?

04:38.444 --> 04:40.738
All right. She's in a meeting
right now.

04:40.822 --> 04:41.864
It's urgent.
This is Cassie Bowden.

04:41.948 --> 04:43.157
Please put Dot on now.

04:43.241 --> 04:45.201
Unfortunately,
Ms. Karlson is speaking

04:45.284 --> 04:47.537
with several of her colleagues
from Langley.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.163
But I'm happy to connect you
with Mr. Berry.

04:49.247 --> 04:51.040
No! No. No, no, thank you.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.458
Just, uh, please tell her
to call me immediately.

04:52.542 --> 04:54.085
-Thank you.

06:24.801 --> 06:26.427
You should have
a heavier coat.

06:26.511 --> 06:28.221
-Hello, Mrs. Briscoe.

06:28.304 --> 06:30.765
I'm impressed you evaded us
for so long.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.726
But here you are,

06:33.810 --> 06:35.103
watching your son Eli.

06:40.733 --> 06:43.152
He always takes this bus
after work.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.488
He's been so sad
since he quit the swim team.

06:46.697 --> 06:48.074
Shame.

06:48.157 --> 06:51.577
I for one thought
he had real talent in the pool.

06:51.661 --> 06:53.079
How do you know all that?

06:53.162 --> 06:54.997
Your interests
are my interests.

06:56.541 --> 06:58.251
It would be so tragic
if I had to

06:58.334 --> 07:00.086
give my superiors
his schedule.

07:00.169 --> 07:02.171
So you'll come with me and

07:02.255 --> 07:03.965
hand over any flash drives
you kept.

07:04.048 --> 07:06.342
We can't risk
traceable content

07:06.425 --> 07:08.344
exposing our entire network
here in the US.

07:10.763 --> 07:12.306
Entire network?

07:14.058 --> 07:16.352
An exclusive club of people
like yourself,

07:16.435 --> 07:18.187
helping my country.

07:18.271 --> 07:19.647
Easy to join...

07:21.107 --> 07:23.109
but no exit policy.

07:25.236 --> 07:27.446
Okay.

07:27.530 --> 07:29.699
Okay, okay, fine.

07:29.782 --> 07:31.909
If I give you everything,
will this be done?

07:34.745 --> 07:37.415
I'll give you everything
I have, okay?

07:38.833 --> 07:40.877
Any kind of evidence
that could be used against you.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.713
Okay? I just...

07:43.796 --> 07:46.924
Please, I just ask that you
just leave my son out of this.

07:48.050 --> 07:51.095
The best I can do is...
we'll see.

08:05.193 --> 08:06.444
It's in the bag.

08:11.282 --> 08:13.117
- Ooh! Jesus.

08:17.079 --> 08:18.831
Oh! My God.

08:34.472 --> 08:35.723
Okay.

08:59.455 --> 09:00.831
Oh, my God! Cassie? Hi!

09:01.999 --> 09:04.293
Jenny, what are--
What are you doing here?

09:04.377 --> 09:05.962
I'm trying to get the scoop
for my podcast.

09:06.045 --> 09:07.880
I heard there was a murder
on my police scanner.

09:07.964 --> 09:09.590
187--that's the code.

09:09.674 --> 09:11.759
The scanner was a little
expensive, but so worth it.

09:11.842 --> 09:13.761
Plus I can always
write it off. Anyway,

09:13.844 --> 09:15.763
I heard the call go out, and
I'm always up for an adventure.

09:15.846 --> 09:17.557
-My boyfriend always says--
-Okay, no. Stop.

09:17.640 --> 09:18.933
Stop. Listen.

09:21.477 --> 09:24.855
Listen, there--
real people died today.

09:24.939 --> 09:26.899
No, no, no, and you're being
smiley and happy,

09:26.983 --> 09:28.651
and talking about adventure
and clickbait,

09:28.734 --> 09:30.069
but it's wrong.

09:30.152 --> 09:31.988
I wish you
a really healthy recovery,

09:32.071 --> 09:32.989
but you need to get some
perspective

09:33.072 --> 09:33.990
on what's going on here.

09:34.073 --> 09:36.325
O-kay. Well, I'm here,

09:36.409 --> 09:37.994
and I'm taking this
seriously, Cassie.

09:38.077 --> 09:39.912
You know what? Fine. Fine.
Can you just stay away from me?

09:39.996 --> 09:41.080
Can we do that?
Can you do that?

09:41.163 --> 09:42.581
I didn't know
you were gonna be here.

09:42.665 --> 09:45.001
If you don't want to talk to me,
fine, but you're not the boss

09:45.084 --> 09:47.295
of crime scenes that don't
even involve you.

09:48.754 --> 09:50.339
You're right. You're right.
Sorry.

09:50.423 --> 09:51.799
I didn't expect to see you.

09:51.882 --> 09:52.967
I didn't mean for this
to be a thing.

09:53.050 --> 09:54.343
You know, you're lecturing me.

09:54.427 --> 09:57.179
Again. And I, like,
really looked up to you.

09:57.263 --> 09:59.348
Like, I wanted to learn
from you and be like you,

09:59.432 --> 10:01.100
but all you ever do is show up
and talk down to me.

10:01.183 --> 10:02.018
I--

10:02.101 --> 10:03.853
Wait...

10:03.936 --> 10:06.188
What are you even doing here?

10:12.445 --> 10:13.863
You want to answer that?

10:26.459 --> 10:28.210
And then Weird Jenny
showed up.

10:28.294 --> 10:29.879
She came to, like,
murder-podcast

10:29.962 --> 10:31.881
the fucking dead bodies,
so we left.

10:31.964 --> 10:33.591
Okay, so you brought
Shane along

10:33.674 --> 10:37.345
on your, uh, nautical
murder mystery adventure.

10:37.428 --> 10:38.846
I mean, no offense, but,
is it wise

10:38.929 --> 10:41.015
to be bringing coworkers along
on shit like this?

10:41.098 --> 10:42.892
Oh, well, he's more than
a flight attendant. I mean,

10:42.975 --> 10:44.310
he's not really--he's...

10:44.393 --> 10:47.229
Cassie. Cassie. No. No.

10:47.313 --> 10:48.981
He's CIA.
He's a CIA agent.

10:49.065 --> 10:50.566
Are you fucking kidding me
right now?

10:50.649 --> 10:51.984
-Whoa. For real?
-I'm sorry.

10:52.068 --> 10:53.402
They're the last people I tell.
I promise.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.905
Okay, stop making promises that
you clearly cannot keep.

10:55.988 --> 10:57.573
-I'm sorry.
-Can we get to work, people?

10:57.656 --> 10:58.949
-Where is the View-Master?
-It's right here.

10:59.033 --> 11:00.743
It's right here. Here.
Here you go.

11:02.161 --> 11:03.412
This is not scary.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.623
I'm sorry that's not scary
enough for you.

11:05.706 --> 11:08.167
Here's what I'm thinking, and
you, Cassie, should sit down.

11:08.250 --> 11:10.169
-Just, go! Tell me.
-Okay.

11:10.252 --> 11:11.379
Every person that has died

11:11.462 --> 11:12.713
has been associated
with Will,

11:12.797 --> 11:14.006
and every photo

11:14.090 --> 11:15.758
marked the location
that they would be killed.

11:15.841 --> 11:17.176
How many slides
are left in here?

11:17.259 --> 11:19.178
-One.
-Right. And the only way

11:19.261 --> 11:21.055
that someone can successfully
frame you

11:21.138 --> 11:22.890
is if you're dead, Cassie.

11:22.973 --> 11:25.267
So I think
this last slide is

11:25.351 --> 11:27.520
where the double plans
to kill you.

11:37.196 --> 11:38.197
-This is a really good time

11:38.280 --> 11:39.990
-to take this call.
-Uh...

11:40.074 --> 11:41.492
Whoa...

11:41.575 --> 11:43.702
Um, she's gonna go
in the bathroom.

11:43.786 --> 11:45.037
It's where everything
important and secret

11:45.121 --> 11:46.122
happens in this house.

11:48.582 --> 11:50.501
-Megan?
-Listen, Cassie.

11:50.584 --> 11:51.961
I have a North Korean
in my trunk

11:52.044 --> 11:53.462
and I'm on the move
so I need your help.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.297
Why do you have a North Korean
in your trunk?

11:55.381 --> 11:56.924
Where was I supposed
to put him?

11:57.007 --> 11:59.301
Now, I was going through
his phone,

11:59.385 --> 12:01.637
and he had information
about me from Hak,

12:01.721 --> 12:03.722
-the guy we stabbed in Iceland?
-No, no, there's no "we."

12:03.806 --> 12:05.266
There's no "we."
Miranda stabbed him.

12:05.349 --> 12:08.227
The point is is that they had
a long text chain about me.

12:08.310 --> 12:10.146
And they also had
a head's up

12:10.229 --> 12:13.649
about a certain CIA officer
that was tracking me.

12:13.732 --> 12:16.152
His name was Shane Evans.

12:17.361 --> 12:19.655
Back in Reykjavik,
you said that Shane

12:19.738 --> 12:22.491
was talking about Hak, so,
I need from you

12:22.575 --> 12:23.909
and please tell me the truth!

12:23.993 --> 12:26.370
Did Shane follow you
to Iceland

12:26.454 --> 12:27.746
because he was after me?

12:27.830 --> 12:29.373
That was not my fault.
Listen, he already--

12:29.457 --> 12:30.875
he already knew about Iceland.

12:30.958 --> 12:32.293
-He was--he--

12:32.376 --> 12:33.836
Okay.

12:33.919 --> 12:35.463
I need you to, um,

12:35.546 --> 12:37.089
I don't know, um,

12:37.173 --> 12:39.216
broker a meeting with Shane,

12:39.300 --> 12:41.343
because I have evidence
to trade.

12:41.427 --> 12:42.845
-Megan, he's not a--
-Cassie!

12:42.928 --> 12:44.096
My life is in crisis!

12:45.431 --> 12:48.726
I am sorry. Please, for me,
talk to Shane.

12:48.809 --> 12:50.352
All right, because I am headed

12:50.436 --> 12:52.313
-to Newark right now, and--

12:55.774 --> 12:57.276
-Oh, my God.

13:10.873 --> 13:11.749
-Yes?
-Ma'am,

13:11.832 --> 13:12.917
are you in need of assistance?

13:13.000 --> 13:15.628
No.
No, I--No, I'm okay,

13:15.711 --> 13:17.671
but that's very nice.
Thank you, officer.

13:17.755 --> 13:21.550
Then are you aware that it is
illegal to drive or park

13:21.634 --> 13:23.719
in the breakdown lane
in New Jersey?

13:23.802 --> 13:25.304
Really?

13:25.387 --> 13:27.264
No, no, I--I--
I had no I--

13:27.348 --> 13:29.099
You know, I'll just go, okay?

13:29.183 --> 13:29.934
-I'll just--
-Ma'am, hold on.

13:30.017 --> 13:31.227
Mm-hmm?

13:31.310 --> 13:33.687
May I see your license
and registration, please?

13:33.771 --> 13:35.189
Sure.

13:38.317 --> 13:40.486
Um, you know what,

13:40.569 --> 13:42.530
I would've never pulled over
if I--if I thought

13:42.613 --> 13:44.323
-it was illegal, you know?

13:46.951 --> 13:48.536
Sorry.

13:48.619 --> 13:50.704
Um...

13:50.788 --> 13:53.999
You know what? I can't seem
to find my license.

13:54.083 --> 13:55.334
I must've left it at home.

13:55.417 --> 13:57.086
I'm really sorry.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.588
I'm gonna need you
to step out of the vehicle.

13:59.672 --> 14:00.839
Okay.

14:05.177 --> 14:06.720
Fuck.

14:26.115 --> 14:27.575
Oh, you have kids?

14:27.658 --> 14:29.118
I--

14:29.201 --> 14:31.996
just, you have See's Candies.

14:32.079 --> 14:33.914
Sorry, it gives me PTSD.

14:33.998 --> 14:36.709
I--I sold them
for my son's swim team.

14:36.792 --> 14:40.087
Yeah, somehow Mom always seems
to have to find the time, right?

14:40.170 --> 14:42.131
They're for my son's
school field trip

14:42.214 --> 14:43.299
to Washington, DC.

14:43.382 --> 14:45.426
There's always a trip to DC.

14:45.509 --> 14:46.969
Tell me about it.

14:47.052 --> 14:48.429
You know, I used to joke
to my husband

14:48.512 --> 14:50.598
that the principal
at Eli's school

14:50.681 --> 14:52.558
got kickbacks
from the candy lobbies.

14:54.184 --> 14:55.561
I'm just happy
that I didn't eat

14:55.644 --> 14:56.979
all of them
'cause they're so good.

14:57.062 --> 14:59.106
My kid was eating them
all himself.

14:59.189 --> 15:00.733
-Oh, no.
-Yeah, so now I'm stuck

15:00.816 --> 15:03.527
-playing Willy Wonka.
-Well, kids. I mean...

15:03.611 --> 15:05.070
We'll do anything for them,
right?

15:06.238 --> 15:07.448
That's the whole thing.

15:07.531 --> 15:09.366
The whole being-a-mom thing,
right?

15:11.201 --> 15:14.747
I'd give anything to be able
to go back home again

15:14.830 --> 15:16.957
to a pile of his dirty laundry.

15:19.585 --> 15:22.254
Or his bathroom looking like
a monsoon just hit it.

15:22.338 --> 15:24.214
Sorry.

15:24.298 --> 15:26.425
You two aren't on good terms?

15:26.508 --> 15:28.385
Well, I was actually, um,

15:28.469 --> 15:30.179
on my way to make things right.

15:31.513 --> 15:33.515
But if I miss my plane...

15:33.599 --> 15:36.143
I won't be able to try, so...

15:38.771 --> 15:42.191
I know this may seem odd,
but...

15:42.274 --> 15:43.484
if you could find it
in your heart

15:43.567 --> 15:45.944
just to let me drive away
so I can get to my family

15:46.028 --> 15:49.323
I'll buy every single
See's Candy you have.

15:49.406 --> 15:52.534
Not a bribe. Okay,
it's kinda like a bribe, but,

15:52.618 --> 15:54.119
maybe you could see it like
a gesture

15:54.203 --> 15:55.537
from one mom to another?

15:55.621 --> 15:57.456
-Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to--
-Please?

16:00.584 --> 16:04.296
Promise me you'll refrain
from parking

16:04.380 --> 16:06.382
in the breakdown lane
in the future.

16:08.926 --> 16:10.260
Yes.

16:22.564 --> 16:24.692
-Hey.

16:24.775 --> 16:26.735
Just making sure
you're okay.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.738
As okay as possible.

16:29.822 --> 16:32.032
Okay, I'm coming in.

16:33.575 --> 16:35.285
Cool, great.

16:35.369 --> 16:37.371
We're in the bathtub.

16:37.454 --> 16:38.580
Okay.

16:43.001 --> 16:45.421
Okay, I'm obviously supposed
to die soon, right?

16:45.504 --> 16:49.383
Like, that's where...
all the arrows are pointing.

16:50.926 --> 16:52.761
I can't get those dead bodies
out of my mind.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.430
I mean, just seeing them.
And I...

16:54.513 --> 16:56.890
had a really horrible,

16:56.974 --> 16:59.435
horrible conversation
with my mother.

16:59.518 --> 17:00.728
Um...

17:02.271 --> 17:04.148
-Wow.
-Want to know the worst part?

17:05.941 --> 17:07.776
She looked me in the eye
and she said,

17:07.860 --> 17:09.236
"I don't like you."

17:12.030 --> 17:13.490
After all this time,
I'm starting to think

17:13.574 --> 17:15.868
maybe she's right.

17:15.951 --> 17:17.536
I don't really like me,
either.

17:19.079 --> 17:20.873
-Yeah, what?! Yes?

17:20.956 --> 17:23.584
Sorry. I--I think
I got something.

17:23.667 --> 17:25.127
Okay,
so here's the last slide.

17:25.210 --> 17:26.920
First I thought it was, like,
a fast food restaurant booth,

17:27.004 --> 17:28.297
but then I realized
it's the same kind of plastic

17:28.380 --> 17:29.965
they would use for seats
on a ride,

17:30.048 --> 17:31.717
which would explain why
it's seemingly up in the air.

17:31.800 --> 17:32.843
Like a ride
at an amusement park?

17:32.926 --> 17:34.720
Yes, and then I was thinking

17:34.803 --> 17:36.138
why is there ocean water
under it?

17:36.221 --> 17:38.390
An amusement park ride
on a pier.

17:38.474 --> 17:40.601
Okay, well, the only one is
obviously Santa Monica Pier.

17:40.684 --> 17:42.478
-It has rides.
-Yeah, but we don't know when.

17:42.561 --> 17:43.979
Well, it has to be today,
right?

17:44.062 --> 17:45.814
-I'm sorry, what?
-Whatever has to happen

17:45.898 --> 17:47.191
at the pier
has to happen today.

17:47.274 --> 17:49.818
Babe, you have to say more.
That doesn't make senses.

17:49.902 --> 17:52.571
Tomorrow it closes for an
entire month of refurbishing,

17:52.654 --> 17:54.114
completely shut off
to the public.

17:54.198 --> 17:55.949
I read about it when I was
planning a visit with Annie,

17:56.033 --> 17:58.786
so given that and the way the
killings have been accelerating,

17:58.869 --> 18:00.788
that would make today
the most likely day.

18:00.871 --> 18:01.997
-I can make you an algorithm--

18:02.080 --> 18:03.248
Max, we understand it.

18:04.541 --> 18:05.751
What is that?

18:05.834 --> 18:08.003
Max, you're literally
unfurling the plot

18:08.086 --> 18:09.463
for us as we speak.
Can you please focus?

18:09.546 --> 18:11.256
-There's something up there.
-Right?

18:15.844 --> 18:17.846
-Uh...
-Whoa!

18:17.930 --> 18:19.640
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

18:19.723 --> 18:21.600
Oh, my God, please don't tell me
that is some sort of

18:21.683 --> 18:23.018
bloody knife in my house?!

18:23.101 --> 18:24.937
Okay, look, your fingerprints
are now all over it.

18:25.020 --> 18:26.230
I didn't know what it was!

18:26.313 --> 18:27.523
Oh, my God,
that woman was in my house!

18:27.606 --> 18:29.608
-Calm down. It's okay.
-Bad news.

18:29.691 --> 18:30.984
Somebody jimmied
the back door.

18:31.068 --> 18:32.611
Great, well, a bloody knife
in your home

18:32.694 --> 18:33.862
is pretty fucking
incriminating.

18:38.325 --> 18:41.203
Jesus Christ, is there literally
anyone else I can talk to?

18:41.286 --> 18:43.455
Oh, don't worry.
I'm here to support your plan.

18:43.539 --> 18:44.498
Go to the pier.

18:44.581 --> 18:47.084
Really?
No wry, suicidal comment?

18:47.167 --> 18:49.211
I can be nice sometimes.

18:50.629 --> 18:52.047
Okay, you're holding a knife,

18:52.130 --> 18:54.383
and you seem different.
What is happening?

18:54.466 --> 18:56.009
Oh, see, no, no.
This is my knife,

18:56.093 --> 18:58.220
But you should grab
a weapon, too, so you feel safe.

18:58.303 --> 19:00.180
Okay, that's actually
a good idea,

19:00.264 --> 19:02.641
but I don't trust
this whole new you situation.

19:02.724 --> 19:03.892
- No, mm-mm.
-Cassie.

19:03.976 --> 19:06.270
Come on, we're finally
on the same page here.

19:06.353 --> 19:08.313
Stop asking questions
and go to the pier.

19:08.397 --> 19:09.857
Go to the fucking pier!

19:09.940 --> 19:11.275
I mean,
it's like a suicide run.

19:11.358 --> 19:13.318
Maybe we'll all get lucky
and you'll get yourself killed.

19:13.402 --> 19:14.736
Fuck you.

19:15.654 --> 19:17.573
You know why "fuck you"
is all you can throw at me?

19:17.656 --> 19:20.409
Because I'm right.
You're a broken, self-absorbed,

19:20.492 --> 19:22.494
piece of shit
who deserves to die.

19:24.538 --> 19:26.081
Shane, we need to go
to the pier right now.

19:26.164 --> 19:27.332
-Right, right now.
-Okay, Cass? Cassie?

19:27.416 --> 19:29.334
Cassie, listen to me.
If Shane is correct

19:29.418 --> 19:30.836
and you are the next person
that is supposed to die

19:30.919 --> 19:33.297
then you are doing exactly
what this crazy person wants.

19:33.380 --> 19:34.673
I mean, bloody knife
in your house

19:34.756 --> 19:36.884
is a pretty strong indicator
that this person is,

19:36.967 --> 19:39.052
like, ten fucking steps
ahead of us.

19:39.136 --> 19:40.888
-Hello?
-You just went and touched that.

19:40.971 --> 19:42.097
Cassie?

19:45.851 --> 19:47.561
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

19:47.644 --> 19:49.271
You don't need a box cutter,
'cause you not going anywhere.

19:49.354 --> 19:51.607
You can say I'm not going, but
when you leave, I'm gonna go,

19:51.690 --> 19:53.400
so the whole world knows
I'm gonna do that, so let's go.

19:53.483 --> 19:55.110
What, you guys are just gonna
appear looking for a blonde?

19:55.193 --> 19:56.862
Hate to state the obvious,
but there are a lot of blondes

19:56.945 --> 19:58.947
-in California.
-No, not this one, okay?

19:59.031 --> 20:01.116
-She looks exactly like me.
-Look, I'm going to do

20:01.199 --> 20:02.576
everything that I can
to protect you,

20:02.659 --> 20:04.745
and you are going to follow
all of my instructions.

20:04.828 --> 20:06.121
I'm gonna--I promise
I'm gonna be good.

20:06.204 --> 20:07.623
-Yes, yes.
-Taking one car or two?

20:07.706 --> 20:09.875
-No, I think we should carpool.
-You are not carpooling.

20:09.958 --> 20:12.044
You two are not going anywhere!
Stay put!

20:12.127 --> 20:14.171
I'm sorry.
Sorry, I'm sorry. Okay.

20:14.254 --> 20:15.881
It's not a fifth grade
field trip.

20:15.964 --> 20:18.175
-Okay, I totally understand now

20:18.258 --> 20:19.468
why Cassie
never listened to me

20:19.551 --> 20:20.761
when I told her not to do
anything.

20:20.844 --> 20:22.054
Yeah. We're still going,
though, right?

20:22.137 --> 20:24.097
-Oh, no, 1000%.
-Yeah, great, cool.

20:24.181 --> 20:26.016
-I'll drive.
-Okay.

20:44.743 --> 20:46.078
Okay, listen,
I need you to be

20:46.161 --> 20:47.788
- focused and on high alert.

20:51.416 --> 20:53.085
That is not high alert!

20:53.168 --> 20:55.504
Okay, listen, um,
I--I--Before we do this,

20:55.587 --> 20:56.672
I need to ask you something.

20:56.755 --> 20:58.382
It's--it's not related,
but important.

20:58.465 --> 21:00.133
Okay, this is probably
not the time for that.

21:00.217 --> 21:01.802
Hypothetically,
if, uh, Megan were to,

21:01.885 --> 21:04.513
I don't know, get back in
the States somehow,

21:04.596 --> 21:06.390
would you agree to--

21:06.473 --> 21:08.934
Put Megan in a federal prison
for life? Yes.

21:09.017 --> 21:10.560
-Hear her out?
-No, listen.

21:10.644 --> 21:12.688
I cannot search and keep track
of you at the same time.

21:12.771 --> 21:14.189
Stay at this bench.

21:14.272 --> 21:16.942
-Don't move.
-This bench? Where it says

21:17.025 --> 21:18.860
"No stopping any time"
in front of everyone?

21:18.944 --> 21:20.320
If you see the double
you text me.

21:20.404 --> 21:22.280
-Obviously. Okay.
-I'll be here.

21:22.364 --> 21:24.366
Also, you just
low-key admitted

21:24.449 --> 21:26.868
to helping a known traitor
get back into the country,

21:26.952 --> 21:29.830
so we're gonna unpack that
at the next party.

21:32.582 --> 21:34.459
Okay, Megan, God damn it.

21:36.294 --> 21:37.421
Davey?

21:38.463 --> 21:39.881
What? I don't...

21:40.924 --> 21:42.634
Shit.

21:55.981 --> 21:57.190
Uh...

21:58.608 --> 21:59.568
Fuck.

22:01.611 --> 22:03.196
Shit.

22:10.120 --> 22:12.581
Cassie's gonna be so fucking
pissed at us for coming here.

22:12.664 --> 22:14.541
She'll get over it.
Also, if we actually stop

22:14.624 --> 22:16.918
this crazy person,
I'm getting myself a churro.

22:17.002 --> 22:19.171
Max, I will buy you every
single churro in Los Angeles

22:19.254 --> 22:21.089
if you find this woman
before someone else dies.

22:21.173 --> 22:22.507
Ooh!

23:16.812 --> 23:18.605
We're having fun now.

23:18.688 --> 23:20.315
There is no "we."

23:20.398 --> 23:21.817
People die every day, Cassie.

23:21.900 --> 23:23.318
Why are you letting it
get under your skin?

23:23.401 --> 23:24.402
Oh, because you're the one

23:24.486 --> 23:26.154
who's supposed to die
this time?

24:13.285 --> 24:16.163
-Hello? Dot?
-I saw that you called.

24:16.246 --> 24:17.831
Cassie,
I wanted to thank you

24:17.914 --> 24:20.167
for all of the evidence
you reported

24:20.250 --> 24:22.210
and more importantly,
for trusting me

24:22.294 --> 24:23.670
with such a sensitive matter.

24:23.753 --> 24:25.338
We're putting together
a task force

24:25.422 --> 24:27.716
to investigate the murders.
I'll be running point.

24:27.799 --> 24:30.010
Wait, what's the noise
in the background?

24:30.093 --> 24:31.428
I'm at Santa Monica Pier.

24:31.511 --> 24:32.637
The double is here.

24:32.721 --> 24:34.097
I think she's about to do
something insane.

24:34.181 --> 24:35.640
What are you doing there,
Cassie?

24:35.724 --> 24:37.350
If you're correct,
this is not safe for you

24:37.434 --> 24:39.853
and you need to leave.
And if you see Mr. Berry

24:39.936 --> 24:41.813
do not engage.

24:41.897 --> 24:43.857
I am on my way to you now.

24:43.940 --> 24:45.358
-Wait, wait, is Benjamin the--

24:45.442 --> 24:46.818
Shit.

24:53.950 --> 24:55.493
Cassie.

24:59.998 --> 25:00.916
Excuse me! Excuse me.
Excuse me.

25:01.791 --> 25:03.585
Coming through! Sorry!
Excuse me! Excuse me!

25:03.668 --> 25:04.586
Move! Excuse me.

25:04.669 --> 25:06.004
Excuse me. Sorry.
Can I---

25:06.087 --> 25:07.214
Can I get through this?

25:07.297 --> 25:08.131
I'm sorry,
can I get through here?

25:08.215 --> 25:09.466
Hi, sorry.

25:11.301 --> 25:12.928
Excuse me!
Excuse me! Excuse me! Sorry.

25:13.011 --> 25:14.179
Can I get on this ride?

25:14.262 --> 25:16.181
I know, I suck! I suck.
Can I get on?

25:16.264 --> 25:18.099
Thank you.

25:44.960 --> 25:46.336
Shit!

25:51.174 --> 25:53.176
Team Home Invasion
is right behind us.

25:56.054 --> 25:58.056
-But what are they doing here?
-I don't know. Looking for us?

25:58.139 --> 25:59.766
We took their shit
and called the cops on them.

25:59.849 --> 26:01.017
It's probably not
a friendly visit.

26:12.570 --> 26:13.613
Glad we made their kill list.

26:13.697 --> 26:15.073
Don't fucking say shit
like "kill list"!

26:15.156 --> 26:16.533
Sorry. Yeah.

26:16.616 --> 26:18.285
What are we supposed to do?
We can't just like...

26:18.368 --> 26:19.411
I don't know, start a life

26:19.494 --> 26:20.745
in this little corner
of the arcade

26:20.829 --> 26:22.080
and just grow old together
and just never come out.

26:22.163 --> 26:23.290
No, no, we have
to fight back somehow.

26:23.373 --> 26:25.041
Great, totally.
We have to fight back.

26:25.125 --> 26:27.460
Except, you know, they're
murderous bounty hunters

26:27.544 --> 26:29.004
-and we're us, so...
-Right.

26:29.087 --> 26:30.755
-Look, I have the taser
-Whoa.

26:30.839 --> 26:32.173
that we stole from them.

26:32.257 --> 26:33.633
What are we gonna do
that requires a taser?

26:33.717 --> 26:36.928
Okay, I'm about to come off
the indecision bench

26:37.012 --> 26:38.138
with, like,
a very large swing

26:38.221 --> 26:40.181
and I'm gonna need you
to trust me, okay?

26:40.265 --> 26:41.433
Okay.

26:41.516 --> 26:44.519
What I'm about to say
is very stupid

26:44.602 --> 26:47.522
and idiotic and extremely
risky and dangerous

26:47.605 --> 26:49.774
and we should never do
anything like this ever again.

26:49.858 --> 26:52.444
Um, that said...

26:52.527 --> 26:54.154
here's my idea.

27:38.490 --> 27:39.866
Mr. Berry.

27:41.201 --> 27:42.702
You shouldn't be here,
Mr. Evans.

27:42.786 --> 27:45.789
Honestly, I was hoping
that you wouldn't be here.

27:47.082 --> 27:48.750
But after everything
that Cassie found out,

27:48.833 --> 27:50.460
I pretty much knew you would.

27:50.543 --> 27:52.879
What do you think
you're doing here?

27:57.425 --> 27:59.302
You should not be here.

28:10.939 --> 28:11.940
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

28:12.023 --> 28:13.566
Why did I get on
this fucking ride?

28:13.650 --> 28:15.110
Come with me.

28:24.994 --> 28:26.329
What the fuck's
going on here?

28:28.706 --> 28:30.166
Oh! Oh.

28:31.459 --> 28:32.961
It's only a little bit
out of order.

28:37.215 --> 28:39.968
You're on a carnival ride
while your friend is dying?

28:40.051 --> 28:42.345
You are helpless.
Although people have been dying

28:42.429 --> 28:43.805
because of you
since you were a little girl.

28:43.888 --> 28:45.306
Your mom won't even
forgive you.

28:45.390 --> 28:46.933
Who the fuck
would forgive you?

28:47.016 --> 28:48.935
You should've died
in that truck with your dad.

28:50.562 --> 28:52.021
You little--

29:00.572 --> 29:02.407
Okay, what is going on?

29:02.490 --> 29:03.658
No. No, no, no, no, no.

29:03.741 --> 29:04.951
That is not my mom.

29:05.034 --> 29:06.703
It's the closest
you get to her.

29:14.169 --> 29:15.336
Mom?

29:19.883 --> 29:21.676
Really not sure
what I'm supposed to do here.

29:21.759 --> 29:23.428
Um, Mom, I'm not...

29:23.511 --> 29:24.888
sure what's...

29:24.971 --> 29:28.016
Oh, I'm not sure about
much of anything right now.

29:30.727 --> 29:35.023
Except so much time wasted.

29:35.857 --> 29:39.068
And you need to stop
breaking your own heart.

29:39.152 --> 29:40.653
That's all I want.

29:41.905 --> 29:43.490
You want me to apologize
to you.

29:43.573 --> 29:44.991
Oh...

29:45.074 --> 29:47.744
I'm not sure I'm ready
to forgive you yet.

29:48.620 --> 29:50.872
You can't control
how I feel, Cassie,

29:50.955 --> 29:53.541
no matter how much
you want to.

29:54.459 --> 29:57.629
You're powerless to make me
forgive you, Cassie.

29:57.712 --> 30:00.381
You're powerless when someone
puts a drink in your hand.

30:01.633 --> 30:04.385
You're powerless
to pull yourself together.

30:04.469 --> 30:07.180
Hell, you're powerless
to get off this Ferris wheel.

30:11.392 --> 30:12.560
Honey...

30:12.644 --> 30:14.771
you can't do anything
but accept it.

30:21.611 --> 30:23.404
What is going on?

30:25.240 --> 30:26.574
Cassie...

30:26.658 --> 30:28.243
I love you.

30:28.326 --> 30:30.537
And I wouldn't be saying it
in here

30:30.620 --> 30:32.997
if it didn't already exist
out there.

30:33.081 --> 30:36.084
Just be patient with others.

30:36.167 --> 30:37.919
With me, if you can.

30:40.964 --> 30:42.966
And with yourself.

31:41.065 --> 31:43.276
So your girl ran away
and left you to take the heat?

31:43.359 --> 31:45.486
-Smart.
-You have no idea how smart.

31:45.570 --> 31:48.406
See, I'm convinced
that you two want to die.

31:48.489 --> 31:50.825
Because you just couldn't
leave it alone, could you?

31:50.908 --> 31:52.535
Listen, Max,
fair is fair, right?

31:52.619 --> 31:53.911
No. Okay--

32:02.587 --> 32:05.173
Zap her!
The other cartridge! Zap her!

32:07.675 --> 32:09.886
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck!

32:11.346 --> 32:12.513
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

32:38.081 --> 32:39.874
Jesus.

32:39.957 --> 32:41.250
That was badass!

32:41.334 --> 32:42.835
- Max...I'm so sorry.
-Hey...

32:42.919 --> 32:44.045
I'm so sorry.
I will never make you be

32:44.128 --> 32:45.380
the damsel in distress
ever again.

32:45.463 --> 32:47.382
-That was so fucking stupid.
-Hey, no, hey, hey.

32:47.465 --> 32:49.634
I trusted you,
and you trusted yourself,

32:49.717 --> 32:50.760
and it worked.

32:50.843 --> 32:52.220
No, I know,
but there are, like,

32:52.303 --> 32:53.638
you know, safer fucking ways

32:53.721 --> 32:55.473
to learn big life lessons,
and--and--

32:55.556 --> 32:57.475
-what was I thinking?
-It worked! It worked.

32:57.558 --> 32:59.644
Whoo!

33:03.648 --> 33:06.651
So now we're, uh...
we're officially engaged?

33:16.661 --> 33:18.329
Cassie.

33:18.413 --> 33:19.580
Grace.

33:22.250 --> 33:23.918
Oh, my God, this was you.

33:24.001 --> 33:25.920
It was you the whole time.
Holy shit!

33:26.003 --> 33:27.380
Let's go.

33:29.716 --> 33:31.050
I want to go again.

33:31.134 --> 33:32.343
I really want to go again.

33:32.427 --> 33:34.137
Okay, double trouble,
take a seat.

33:39.267 --> 33:41.894
Jesus, this is fucked.

33:49.777 --> 33:51.195
I fucking knew it was you.

33:51.279 --> 33:52.989
I knew it was you.
I didn't want it to be,

33:53.072 --> 33:55.116
but I fucking knew it.

33:55.199 --> 33:56.451
So what, do you just

33:56.534 --> 33:58.453
creepily befriend someone
and then go dress like them

33:58.536 --> 33:59.787
and then
go murder a bunch of people?

33:59.871 --> 34:00.913
I don't want to be doing
any of this.

34:00.997 --> 34:02.415
Grace, you don't have
to do that.

34:02.498 --> 34:03.708
You don't have to do anything
you don't want to do.

34:03.791 --> 34:04.959
Benjamin Berry, no one.

34:05.042 --> 34:06.085
No one can make you
do something

34:06.169 --> 34:07.336
that you don't want to do.

34:07.420 --> 34:09.464
-Benjamin Berry?
-Yes! Yeah!

34:09.547 --> 34:10.965
He definitely can't make me
do anything.

34:11.048 --> 34:12.633
I just stabbed him.

34:12.717 --> 34:13.968
Wait, what...

34:20.808 --> 34:22.977
Okay, um...

34:23.060 --> 34:25.813
I--I thought you were wor...

34:29.567 --> 34:31.486
Jesus, Cassie,
I'm a trained killer.

34:31.569 --> 34:33.988
You're a flight attendant
with a box cutter.

34:35.406 --> 34:37.742
And everybody here saw
two blondes get on this ride,

34:37.825 --> 34:39.035
and both of us
being on here together

34:39.118 --> 34:40.286
really fucks the whole plan.

34:40.369 --> 34:41.913
-It's not great.
-Oh, God.

34:44.332 --> 34:45.833
Why are you the one
freaking out here?

34:45.917 --> 34:47.919
I told you, this is not my very
fucking favorite thing to do.

34:48.002 --> 34:49.212
-Okay? Any of it.
-Oh, okay, just--okay.

34:49.295 --> 34:50.755
I genuinely liked you.

34:50.838 --> 34:52.632
It's so much bigger
than you or me.

34:52.715 --> 34:54.217
Okay, Grace, please,
listen.

34:54.300 --> 34:56.135
You told me that when
my life was falling apart

34:56.219 --> 34:58.012
to come to you.
Well, my world is falling apart

34:58.096 --> 34:59.972
so please,
please put that gun down.

35:00.056 --> 35:02.558
I am begging you,
please do not shoot that gun.

35:02.642 --> 35:04.268
I wanted out of the army.

35:04.352 --> 35:06.771
Like, at all costs, 'cause
I hated what they made me do.

35:06.854 --> 35:08.064
-What?
-And now I'm doing

35:08.147 --> 35:09.732
the exact thing
that I didn't want to be doing--

35:09.816 --> 35:11.484
I'm killing people
for someone else.

35:11.567 --> 35:13.319
It's just
such a fucking trap.

35:13.402 --> 35:15.321
Well, why me? Why me?
Why did you--

35:15.404 --> 35:17.240
Why did you plant
that View-Master?

35:17.323 --> 35:19.116
What View-Master?
What are you talking about?

35:26.082 --> 35:27.667
Look, if it was up to me,
then neither of us

35:27.750 --> 35:29.627
would be here right now.
Now who am I

35:29.710 --> 35:31.045
now that I spend my time
dressed up like you?

35:31.128 --> 35:32.964
Where can I go? Nowhere!

35:33.047 --> 35:35.633
Okay, yes, you can.
There's always a way out.

35:35.716 --> 35:37.218
I killed people.

35:37.301 --> 35:39.053
When this ride is over,
I'm going to prison.

35:39.136 --> 35:42.014
The worst part,
I never had a choice.

35:42.098 --> 35:43.766
-Okay, okay, listen to me.

35:43.850 --> 35:46.727
Just tell me who
is making you do this.

35:46.811 --> 35:48.813
You do have a choice
right now.

35:48.896 --> 35:50.106
You do have a choice.

35:50.189 --> 35:52.316
No, you're right.
I do have a choice.

35:54.193 --> 35:56.612
Okay, Grace, listen to me.
Just listen to me.

35:58.281 --> 35:59.657
-No--
