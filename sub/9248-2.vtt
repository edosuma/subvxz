00:02.872 --> 00:05.483
Previously onMike & Molly:Do you ever just kind of

00:05.570 --> 00:07.137
stand back and look at your life

00:07.224 --> 00:08.878
and think, "This is not
what I ought to be"?

00:08.965 --> 00:11.402
Listen up, because this might be

00:11.489 --> 00:13.622
the best lesson
I ever teach you.

00:16.973 --> 00:20.150
Okay, don't settle.
Follow your dreams...

00:20.237 --> 00:22.370
wherever they may take you!

00:22.457 --> 00:23.414
[splash]

00:24.981 --> 00:26.678
Want to tell me
what happened today?

00:26.765 --> 00:28.245
I'm not sure, you know?

00:28.332 --> 00:30.204
I just... started

00:30.291 --> 00:33.511
feeling overwhelmed
by everything.

00:33.598 --> 00:35.426
And I don't know,
leaving just seemed

00:35.513 --> 00:36.906
like the right thing to do.

00:36.993 --> 00:38.864
Through the window?

00:38.951 --> 00:41.780
Anybody can leave
through a door.

00:41.867 --> 00:43.739
[sighs]

00:43.826 --> 00:47.134
Kids in Chicago deserve teachers
who want to be there for them,

00:47.221 --> 00:49.658
and that-that may have been me
at one point,

00:49.745 --> 00:50.746
but it's not me now.

00:50.833 --> 00:53.575
Something's changed in me.

00:53.662 --> 00:56.186
Something's broken,
or maybe something's fixed.

00:56.273 --> 01:00.321
I don't know, but I know that
I can't do this one more day.

01:00.408 --> 01:01.844
You realize, Ms. Flynn,
if you quit,

01:01.931 --> 01:03.498
you lose your pension,
your health care

01:03.585 --> 01:04.151
and all your benefits?

01:06.631 --> 01:09.069
[hushed]: Really?
Is that true?

01:09.156 --> 01:12.246
The truth is I have no idea
what's going on with Molly.

01:12.333 --> 01:14.030
Well, I don't want to throw
salt on the wound,

01:14.117 --> 01:16.685
but if you two
ever have kids,

01:16.772 --> 01:20.167
you should know you got loony
on your dad's side, too.

01:20.254 --> 01:22.473
For the last time,
she's not loony.

01:22.560 --> 01:24.649
She's just going through
something.

01:24.736 --> 01:26.477
[slurring]:
Well, I'm not gonna fight you.

01:26.564 --> 01:29.132
And I have a very good reason.
I have three of them.

01:29.219 --> 01:30.916
Number one...

01:33.049 --> 01:34.833
Oh, God,
what have I done?!

01:34.920 --> 01:36.748
Come here.

01:36.835 --> 01:40.187
Oh, God, Mike, I quit my job
and gave up all my benefits!

01:40.274 --> 01:41.231
And I probably need
a tetanus shot

01:41.318 --> 01:44.104
from that woman's tooth.

01:44.191 --> 01:45.714
I know, sweetie, I know.

01:45.801 --> 01:47.890
We're gonna be fine.

01:47.977 --> 01:50.371
Ooh...!

01:50.458 --> 01:53.678
Ah...!

01:58.509 --> 02:00.642
So, how's
the job search coming?

02:00.729 --> 02:02.731
Ma, we don't ask that.

02:02.818 --> 02:03.862
No, Mike, it's fine.

02:03.949 --> 02:05.516
I've been circling a few things.

02:05.603 --> 02:09.085
I can always get you in
at the school cafeteria.

02:09.172 --> 02:11.740
What are you in a hairnet,
a six?

02:11.827 --> 02:14.438
Well, it's a generous offer,

02:14.525 --> 02:17.659
but I've been feeding little
kids crap for ten years.

02:17.746 --> 02:21.097
I-I think I'm just kind of done.

02:21.184 --> 02:22.185
So, you're just
gonna continue

02:22.272 --> 02:24.361
your life
of leisure, huh?

02:24.448 --> 02:26.494
Congratulations, Mikey,
you got yourself

02:26.581 --> 02:28.148
one of them trophy wives.

02:28.235 --> 02:29.714
Hey, I amworking.

02:29.801 --> 02:31.281
And I've always been
a trophy. Tell her.

02:31.368 --> 02:33.414
She's always been a trophy.

02:33.501 --> 02:36.199
No, about-about the work.

02:36.286 --> 02:39.420
Oh. Molly is a writer now.

02:39.507 --> 02:41.117
PEGGY:
Oh!

02:41.204 --> 02:43.119
Why didn't you say so?

02:43.206 --> 02:45.165
Let me clear a spot
in my bookcase.

02:47.602 --> 02:48.864
Well, you better clear
two spots

02:48.951 --> 02:49.995
'cause there's gonna be
a sequel.

02:50.082 --> 02:52.084
Really?

02:52.172 --> 02:53.608
What's the first one about?

02:53.695 --> 02:55.653
I don't know yet.

02:55.740 --> 02:58.439
But it sets up the second one.

02:58.526 --> 03:01.311
Yeah. It just so happens that
there are a lot of regular women

03:01.398 --> 03:03.226
just like me who've written
best-selling books.

03:03.313 --> 03:04.445
Name one.

03:04.532 --> 03:06.142
Harry Potter, Twilight Saga,

03:06.229 --> 03:07.404
Fifty Shades of Grey.

03:07.491 --> 03:08.492
Never heard of 'em.

03:08.579 --> 03:10.102
Ma.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.496
Okay, maybe the Greybook.

03:12.583 --> 03:14.716
Help me out here.

03:14.803 --> 03:16.370
Talk about something else, Ma.

03:16.457 --> 03:19.329
Well, if we're talking
about pipe dreams,

03:19.416 --> 03:20.896
I want to marry
Engelbert Humperdinck

03:20.983 --> 03:22.245
and live in a house
made of beef jerky.

03:22.332 --> 03:24.943
You know what,
Peggy?

03:25.030 --> 03:27.337
I walked out of that school
because I was sick of people

03:27.424 --> 03:29.121
like you telling me
what I can't do.

03:29.209 --> 03:32.212
And I am done stifling
my creativity and my passion.

03:32.299 --> 03:34.866
So you get ready, 'cause you
and the rest of the world

03:34.953 --> 03:36.781
are about to see what I can do.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.131
[blows raspberry]

03:41.525 --> 03:43.005
That's it!
We're doing this!

03:43.092 --> 03:44.354
Make your move! Come on!
Come on!

03:44.441 --> 03:46.400
I'll give you
one swing.

03:46.487 --> 03:48.402
No, Molly, don't!
Nobody's fighting!
Nobody's fighting!

03:48.489 --> 03:50.491
Nobody's fighting!
Nobody's fighting!
Nobody's fighting!

03:50.578 --> 03:53.189
Nobody's fighting!
Nobody's fighting!

03:57.759 --> 03:59.369
I could've taken her.

03:59.456 --> 04:00.936
Look, I'm not saying

04:01.023 --> 04:02.720
you wouldn't have got
a few shots in,

04:02.807 --> 04:04.287
but my mom fights dirty.

04:04.374 --> 04:06.681
If she got you on
the ground, it's over.

04:06.768 --> 04:09.031
You think I can write a book,
don't you?

04:09.118 --> 04:10.989
Of course I do.

04:11.076 --> 04:12.121
You know,
I'm already making progress.

04:12.208 --> 04:13.601
I've narrowed down my genre.

04:13.688 --> 04:15.690
Ooh, look at you
with a "genre."

04:15.777 --> 04:17.257
Contemporary crime fiction.

04:17.344 --> 04:20.608
Oh, that's what a genre is.

04:20.695 --> 04:22.436
I'm gonna need your support.

04:22.523 --> 04:24.525
You got it. 100%, babe.

04:24.612 --> 04:26.309
A book like that takes a lot
of work and research.

04:26.396 --> 04:29.181
Whatever you need,
I'm there for you.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.400
Great. 'Cause I want
to go on a ride-along

04:30.487 --> 04:33.098
in the squad car
with you and Carl.

04:33.185 --> 04:34.099
[tires screech, horn blares]

04:34.186 --> 04:35.275
Sorry!

04:35.362 --> 04:37.189
Say again?

04:37.277 --> 04:39.148
Mike, I need to get out there

04:39.235 --> 04:40.715
and experience police work
firsthand.

04:40.802 --> 04:43.457
I need to breathe it and
live it and smell it.

04:43.544 --> 04:45.154
Okay, first of all,
it could be dangerous.

04:45.241 --> 04:46.677
Secondly,
if you want to know

04:46.764 --> 04:48.505
what my squad car
smells like,

04:48.592 --> 04:49.114
imagine baby powder mixed
with German potato salad.

04:49.201 --> 04:51.682
Mike...

04:51.769 --> 04:53.162
Carl says it's aftershave,
but I think it's his diet.

04:53.249 --> 04:55.947
Just forget it.
I'll ask somebody else.

04:56.034 --> 04:57.297
Come on.

04:57.384 --> 04:59.690
Fine. I'll just go back
to teaching,

04:59.777 --> 05:02.389
be miserable
the rest of my life.

05:02.476 --> 05:05.653
I guess I could talk
to the captain

05:05.740 --> 05:08.308
and see if I can get
a ride-along approved.

05:08.395 --> 05:10.484
Really?
Oh, it's gonna be so great!

05:10.571 --> 05:12.181
Oh!
[sighs]

05:12.268 --> 05:14.096
Don't get too excited.
Nothing's definite yet.

05:14.183 --> 05:16.707
Okay, I won't, I won't.
I won't get my hopes up.

05:16.794 --> 05:18.796
Oh, are we gonna see
a dead body?

05:18.883 --> 05:20.624
Molly!I'm just saying,

05:20.711 --> 05:22.626
people get murdered every day.
Maybe we'll get lucky!

05:59.010 --> 06:01.012
That's because you're an idiot.

06:01.099 --> 06:04.494
Cops need to keep their home
life and work life separate!

06:04.581 --> 06:06.017
I suppose.

06:06.104 --> 06:07.149
You're worried
she might be threatened

06:07.236 --> 06:08.672
by how close we are?

06:09.717 --> 06:10.674
What?!

06:10.761 --> 06:12.415
Not in a physical sense,

06:12.502 --> 06:14.896
but, you know, an
emotional connection.

06:14.983 --> 06:18.900
What the hell
are you talking about?

06:18.987 --> 06:20.771
Women can be jealous creatures.

06:20.858 --> 06:22.730
And let's face it, after riding
together for eight years,

06:22.817 --> 06:26.081
I amyour most stable
and successful relationship.

06:26.168 --> 06:27.691
She may be your lawful
wedded wife, but...

06:27.778 --> 06:31.216
[chuckling]:
she can never touch what we got.

06:31.303 --> 06:33.697
I don't think this
is the conversation

06:33.784 --> 06:35.046
we should be having
near the shower.

06:35.133 --> 06:37.135
Don't be homophobic,
all right?

06:37.222 --> 06:38.963
A man can love
another man

06:39.050 --> 06:40.443
without having
to drop the soap.

06:41.749 --> 06:43.881
Let's go!
All right.

06:43.968 --> 06:47.319
I love Mike Biggs!
I'm not ashamed to say it!

06:47.407 --> 06:49.539
Why couldn't I have
a dog for a partner?

06:52.499 --> 06:54.414
Hi.

06:54.501 --> 06:56.241
What are you doing here?

06:56.328 --> 06:58.548
I didn't like
how we left things
the other night

06:58.635 --> 07:02.900
and just think we need
to resolve our issues
once and for all.

07:02.987 --> 07:03.945
Oh,

07:04.032 --> 07:06.164
so you came to apologize.

07:06.251 --> 07:09.472
Yes, I am sorry.

07:09.559 --> 07:11.953
Sorry I didn't
do this sooner.

"She drops the icicle

"Millie was finally free

she was meant to be."

[gasps]

07:33.496 --> 07:35.193
What do you think?!

07:35.280 --> 07:38.109
I think you want
to kill Mike's mom.

07:38.196 --> 07:40.460
What? How-how are you...
how are you getting that?

07:40.547 --> 07:42.244
JOYCE:
Oh, come on.

07:42.331 --> 07:44.768
We've all thought about
putting that old bag down.

07:44.855 --> 07:47.423
We just haven't been dumb enough
to write a confession

07:47.510 --> 07:49.207
for the police to find.

07:49.294 --> 07:50.644
This is fiction!

07:50.731 --> 07:52.297
I'm not Millie,
Penny's not Peggy.

07:52.384 --> 07:54.386
Stabbing is so messy.

07:54.474 --> 07:55.823
You don't want to ruin

07:55.910 --> 07:58.042
that beautiful coat
you described.

07:58.129 --> 07:59.609
You're missing the point!

07:59.696 --> 08:01.132
I stabbed her with an icicle!

08:01.219 --> 08:02.656
I mean, the character,

08:02.743 --> 08:04.484
the character stabbed her
with an icicle.

08:04.571 --> 08:06.398
The murder weapon melts.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.313
It's the, it's a perfect crime!

08:08.400 --> 08:10.794
Does this make us accomplices?

08:10.881 --> 08:12.448
'Cause I'm too pretty
for prison.

08:12.535 --> 08:14.276
Those girls will eat me
for dinner.

08:14.363 --> 08:16.670
Literally.

08:18.454 --> 08:20.282
Hey, everybody.

08:20.369 --> 08:22.589
Hey! So what'd
you find out?

08:22.676 --> 08:24.416
Can I go on the ride-along?

08:24.504 --> 08:26.418
I looked through every rule
and regulation and...

08:26.506 --> 08:28.812
apparently, you can.

08:28.899 --> 08:31.162
Really? Oh, my God!

08:31.249 --> 08:32.337
Oh, God, I've got
so much to plan and do.

08:32.424 --> 08:34.818
Am I gonna get a uniform?

08:34.905 --> 08:36.341
No!
Okay.

08:36.428 --> 08:38.692
Of course not.
This is gonna be so fun!

08:38.779 --> 08:40.084
No, it's not.

08:40.171 --> 08:41.956
It's a police car,
not a playground.

08:42.043 --> 08:45.481
That's good. "This is a police
car, not a playground."

08:45.568 --> 08:48.179
That's the kind
of jazzy street talk

08:48.266 --> 08:49.224
I've been looking for.

08:49.311 --> 08:50.747
Your dialogue's fine.

08:50.834 --> 08:51.835
It's killing people
you're no good at.

08:53.663 --> 08:55.447
You wrote something already?
Can I take a look at it?

08:55.535 --> 08:57.885
Oh, no, well, not yet.

08:57.972 --> 09:00.844
You know,
I still have to tweak

09:00.931 --> 09:02.933
some character traits
and change a few names.

09:03.020 --> 09:05.719
Maybe run it past a lawyer.

09:22.605 --> 09:23.519
for this ride-along.

09:23.606 --> 09:25.477
You got it.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.741
Okay, don't touch anything
inside the car.

09:27.828 --> 09:29.438
And stay in the vehicle

09:29.525 --> 09:32.310
unless Carl or I directly
tell you to get out.

09:32.397 --> 09:34.922
Roger that.

09:35.009 --> 09:37.446
And whatever you do, do not talk
to any suspects or arrestees.

09:37.533 --> 09:39.535
No problem.

09:39.622 --> 09:41.842
What do I do
if they talk to me first?

09:41.929 --> 09:44.975
Nobody's gonna talk to you.

09:45.062 --> 09:47.804
You don't know that.
And I'm-I'm very approachable.

09:47.891 --> 09:50.372
Oh, hey, what if I pretend
to be their friend,

09:50.459 --> 09:51.721
kind of gain their confidence

09:51.808 --> 09:54.768
and find out
who the big fish is?

09:54.855 --> 09:57.422
I repeat: no talking.

09:57.509 --> 09:59.207
You got it!

09:59.294 --> 10:01.252
Okay, just fly on the wall,
you know?

10:01.339 --> 10:04.691
You just go about your business
and pretend I'm not even here.

10:04.778 --> 10:07.041
Ride-along, day one.

10:07.128 --> 10:08.782
The streets are quiet...
too quiet.

10:08.869 --> 10:10.610
Are-are you gonna be recording
what we say?

10:10.697 --> 10:13.264
Oh, just a quick way
to get my ideas down.

10:13.351 --> 10:15.005
Don't worry. I'll change the
names to protect the innocent.

10:15.092 --> 10:16.877
All right, well, just don't
play it back for me,

10:16.964 --> 10:17.921
cause, you know,
I hate the way

10:18.008 --> 10:19.140
my voice sounds on tape.

10:19.227 --> 10:22.404
It sounds higher, more womanly.

10:22.491 --> 10:23.927
[high-pitched]:
Like, I'm all the way up here,
but in my mind,

10:24.014 --> 10:24.972
[low-pitched]:
I'm all the way down here.

10:26.190 --> 10:28.410
Officer
Carl McMillan.

10:28.497 --> 10:31.369
This is CNN.
[sighs]

10:31.456 --> 10:32.501
Boy, this is exciting.

10:32.588 --> 10:33.850
You know?

10:33.937 --> 10:35.547
Just riding around
the city all day

10:35.635 --> 10:39.551
and scanning for criminals
and... Ooh.

10:39.639 --> 10:40.944
Look at that shifty guy.

10:41.031 --> 10:42.250
What's his story?

10:42.337 --> 10:43.686
Is he gonna roll
that old woman,

10:43.773 --> 10:45.340
or jack a car?

10:45.427 --> 10:47.342
Maybe he's a foot soldier
in a big drug cartel,

10:47.429 --> 10:49.649
the likes of which
this city has never seen.

10:49.736 --> 10:51.955
Damn, I thought I was recording.

10:52.042 --> 10:53.348
What did I say?

10:53.435 --> 10:54.871
Hey, did you guys
catch what I said?

10:54.958 --> 10:56.133
Yeah, I think you wanted
to arrest a drug lord

10:56.220 --> 10:58.266
who was taking
his Yorkie for a walk.

10:58.353 --> 11:00.442
Oh, I didn't see the dog.

11:00.529 --> 11:02.139
Yeah, that's because
I don't have

11:02.226 --> 11:04.185
the trained eye as you guys.

11:04.272 --> 11:07.144
But how many bags of smack
can you get in a Yorkie?

11:07.231 --> 11:08.711
Ooh, movie idea:

11:08.798 --> 11:11.627
flamboyant man hides drugs
in show dogs.

11:11.714 --> 11:13.716
Possibly animated?

11:13.803 --> 11:16.545
Well, look
who it is.

11:16.632 --> 11:18.808
Yep, fresh out of jail,
already on the street.

11:18.895 --> 11:19.853
Who?
Who are we looking at?

11:19.940 --> 11:21.724
His name
is Hugo.

11:21.811 --> 11:23.378
We busted him last year
for selling dope.

11:23.465 --> 11:24.509
Ooh...
Oh, he sells dope?

11:24.596 --> 11:25.597
Mm-hmm.
Fantastic.

11:25.685 --> 11:26.511
Are we gonna shake him down?

11:26.598 --> 11:27.817
Uh-uh.
No.

11:27.904 --> 11:28.513
We're gonna
talk to him.Oh.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.515
Hugo!

11:30.602 --> 11:30.690
Get over here.

11:31.734 --> 11:34.606
Oh, come on, Biggs.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.173
I'm not doin' nothin'.

11:36.260 --> 11:37.697
I'm just talkin' to a friend.

11:37.784 --> 11:40.003
Nobody said
you were "doin'" anything.

11:40.090 --> 11:41.439
We just want to say hello.

11:41.526 --> 11:42.919
Molly!

11:43.006 --> 11:45.313
Would you prefer
I do handwritten notes?

11:45.400 --> 11:46.836
Yeah, please.
Okay.

11:46.923 --> 11:48.185
But you're gonna have
to talk slower.

11:48.272 --> 11:49.534
And can you ask Hugo
to enunciate?

11:49.621 --> 11:51.058
Uh, no offense,

11:51.145 --> 11:54.278
but your street patois
is a little thick.

11:54.365 --> 11:55.715
MIKE:
You know what, Hugo?

11:55.802 --> 11:56.977
Have a good day.

11:57.064 --> 11:58.456
Let's go.Wait, wait, wait, wait.

11:58.543 --> 11:59.849
What's a better return
on investment:

11:59.936 --> 12:00.676
crack or heroin?

12:01.721 --> 12:03.766
Drive the car, Carl.

12:03.853 --> 12:05.463
Nice meeting you!

12:05.550 --> 12:08.902
Ooh...

12:08.989 --> 12:10.947
That got real back there.

12:18.825 --> 12:19.956
I've gotta
tell you guys,

12:20.043 --> 12:22.393
after just a few
hours on patrol,

12:22.480 --> 12:24.439
I have a newfound respect
for what you do.

12:24.526 --> 12:26.310
Thanks, honey.
Yeah.

12:26.397 --> 12:27.834
We're not heroes.

12:27.921 --> 12:29.400
We're just regular men
who, you know,

12:29.487 --> 12:32.839
do what heroes do.

12:32.926 --> 12:34.797
You put your lives
on the line every day.

12:34.884 --> 12:36.625
I mean,
aren't you scared?

12:36.712 --> 12:37.931
Well, fear is a very
human reaction...

12:38.018 --> 12:40.672
I got this, Mike.
[clears throat]

12:40.760 --> 12:43.284
Yes, we do feel fear.

12:43.371 --> 12:44.676
But we just...Carl...

12:47.201 --> 12:49.246
Man, you just can't be
sneaking up on me like that.

12:49.333 --> 12:50.813
Sorry.

12:50.900 --> 12:52.249
This is for you.

12:52.336 --> 12:53.642
I didn't order a milk shake.

12:53.729 --> 12:56.863
It was sent over
by an admirer of yours.

12:56.950 --> 12:57.864
Oh...

12:57.951 --> 12:59.866
Wow.

12:59.953 --> 13:00.997
Carl, good for you.

13:01.084 --> 13:02.477
She's gorgeous.

13:02.564 --> 13:04.218
You mean "he's gorgeous."

13:04.914 --> 13:06.524
No!

13:06.611 --> 13:08.657
Yes.

13:08.744 --> 13:10.790
Every inch of him.

13:11.965 --> 13:13.662
I told you, nothing happened.

13:13.749 --> 13:16.883
It's a classic case of
"he said, he said."

13:16.970 --> 13:19.494
Uh, excuse me.
Do you want to come
sit with us?

13:19.581 --> 13:21.061
Molly, please, no!

13:21.148 --> 13:23.324
It's good research
for my book.
[sighs]

13:23.411 --> 13:24.804
[masculine voice]:
Hello, Carl.

13:24.891 --> 13:25.848
Wow.

13:27.241 --> 13:30.157
Hi, Lousette.

13:30.244 --> 13:32.637
Thanks for
the milk shake.

13:33.900 --> 13:34.857
Hi, Lousette.

13:34.944 --> 13:36.511
I'm Molly,
Mike's wife.

13:36.598 --> 13:38.861
Former teacher,
aspiring author.

13:38.948 --> 13:40.645
Would you mind if
I asked you
a few questions?

13:40.732 --> 13:41.516
I have nothing to hide.

13:41.603 --> 13:41.995
The hell you don't.

13:44.432 --> 13:45.737
You managed
to hide it

13:45.825 --> 13:48.828
for three hours
and a carriage ride.

13:48.915 --> 13:50.830
Actually, that's...
that's kind of
my first question.

13:50.917 --> 13:53.441
How... how do
you hide it?

13:53.528 --> 13:55.356
Well, there's a lot of tucking
and a lot of tape.

13:55.443 --> 13:56.400
Oh.

13:56.487 --> 13:58.185
Well, that
makes sense.

13:58.272 --> 14:00.927
For some reason,
my mind went to string.

14:01.014 --> 14:04.408
Oh... uh, movie idea:

14:04.495 --> 14:06.541
street-savvy cop
falls in love

14:06.628 --> 14:08.499
with a beautiful
cross-dressing informant.

14:08.586 --> 14:09.805
Uh... oh.

14:09.892 --> 14:11.111
An Officer and
His Gentleman.

14:11.198 --> 14:12.503
Oh, could you...

14:12.590 --> 14:14.505
Could... could you
turn that off?

14:14.592 --> 14:16.464
It was just one kiss,
and it was New Year's Eve.

14:16.551 --> 14:19.380
I assume the kissing stopped
when the ball dropped.

14:21.773 --> 14:22.818
DISPATCHER [over radio]:
Car 3557.

14:22.905 --> 14:24.515
We have a 10-16 at 412 Grand.

14:24.602 --> 14:25.560
That's us.

14:25.647 --> 14:26.953
10-16.
What's a 10-16?

14:27.040 --> 14:28.258
It's a domestic disturbance.[gasps]

14:28.345 --> 14:30.173
Yes!

14:30.260 --> 14:31.783
This is car 3557,

14:31.871 --> 14:33.742
in the vicinity and responding.

14:33.829 --> 14:35.396
Your story will
be told... Ooh.

14:35.483 --> 14:36.658
Those are gorgeous
shoes...
MIKE:
Molly!

14:36.745 --> 14:37.746
We gotta roll.

14:40.140 --> 14:42.142
[siren wailing]

14:44.013 --> 14:45.232
All right, Molly.

14:45.319 --> 14:46.668
You know the rules.
Stay in the car.

14:46.755 --> 14:47.843
These domestic situations
can go bad fast.

14:47.930 --> 14:49.497
Okay.

14:49.584 --> 14:50.846
I can't be worrying about you
and do my job

14:50.933 --> 14:52.152
at the same time.
Do you hear me?

14:52.239 --> 14:53.893
Yes, I do.
Can I say one thing?

14:53.980 --> 14:56.112
Quickly.You are so sexy
when you talk like that.

14:56.199 --> 14:57.548
I really want
to kiss you right now.

14:57.635 --> 14:59.159
Quickly.

14:59.246 --> 15:00.769
Okay.

15:00.856 --> 15:02.118
CARL:
Gotta go.

15:02.205 --> 15:03.903
MIKE:
All right, stay.

15:03.990 --> 15:05.165
You big blue tease!

15:05.252 --> 15:07.819
Go get 'em.

15:07.907 --> 15:10.518
Wife of cop,
torn between loving her man

15:10.605 --> 15:13.738
and sharing him
with the city that needs him.

15:13.825 --> 15:15.479
Whew...

15:15.566 --> 15:16.872
hot and bothered.

15:20.702 --> 15:22.051
Oh.

15:22.138 --> 15:24.836
Aha.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.577
Smart.

15:26.664 --> 15:30.059
Note to self: back doors
and windows don't open or...

15:30.146 --> 15:31.931
criminals would escape.

15:36.326 --> 15:38.415
We could just...

15:38.502 --> 15:41.331
crank that air-conditioning up

15:41.418 --> 15:44.552
a little bit...

15:44.639 --> 15:45.770
[grunts]

15:45.857 --> 15:47.642
God, I got arms like a T. rex.

15:50.732 --> 15:52.168
Ah, this looks familiar.

15:52.255 --> 15:54.518
Hello.

15:54.605 --> 15:56.042
There we go.

15:56.129 --> 15:58.087
Whew. That's better.

15:58.174 --> 15:59.523
Whew...

15:59.610 --> 16:01.177
Teaching fourth grade

16:01.264 --> 16:03.527
would've been a lot easier
with one of these.

16:03.614 --> 16:05.616
Oh...

16:07.053 --> 16:10.447
That's not good.

16:11.927 --> 16:13.407
No, no, no!
Not a criminal!

16:13.494 --> 16:15.235
I just... it just got
real hot back here.

16:17.193 --> 16:18.412
That crazy bitch
tried to kill me!

16:18.499 --> 16:19.979
I didn't even
touch you yet!

16:20.066 --> 16:21.589
Oh, yes, you did!

16:21.676 --> 16:23.852
You cut off my ponytail
while I was sleeping.

16:23.939 --> 16:26.246
Might as well be dead,
I look so stupid.

16:27.856 --> 16:29.771
It doesn't look so bad.

16:29.858 --> 16:30.380
I mean, it's a little choppy,
but it really frames your face.

16:30.467 --> 16:33.166
Carl.

16:33.253 --> 16:34.906
He's lucky I didn't
cut off something else!All right.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.473
That's a verbal threat.
That's a verbal threat!

16:36.560 --> 16:38.388
You need
to calm down.

16:38.475 --> 16:39.520
Do you want to spend
the night in jail?
Is that what you want?

16:39.607 --> 16:41.217
No, sir.

16:41.304 --> 16:42.349
Mike, psst, hey.

16:42.436 --> 16:44.873
Mike...

16:44.960 --> 16:46.092
What the hell
are you doin' here?

16:46.179 --> 16:47.528
I told you to wait
in the car.

16:47.615 --> 16:48.964
I know, but I found this
in the front seat.

16:49.051 --> 16:50.357
You said it might
be dangerous... Careful.

16:50.444 --> 16:52.489
That thing comes out
faster than you think.

16:52.576 --> 16:53.838
Thank you.

16:53.925 --> 16:55.101
Now get back in the car.

16:55.188 --> 16:56.406
Are you sure I can't
just observe?

16:56.493 --> 16:57.886
I'll be quiet
as a mouse.

16:57.973 --> 16:59.670
I love you,
but you are killing me.

16:59.757 --> 17:01.411
As a police officer,

17:01.498 --> 17:02.543
I am ordering you
back into that vehicle.Right.

17:02.630 --> 17:03.500
Right, right, right.

17:03.587 --> 17:05.111
See?

17:05.198 --> 17:06.242
That's how a healthy couple
resolves a conflict.

17:06.329 --> 17:07.504
All right?
No feelings are hurt

17:07.591 --> 17:09.158
and nothing
got cut off.

17:09.245 --> 17:10.464
I'm guessing he didn't
sleep with her sister.

17:10.551 --> 17:11.421
Ew!
He slept with her sister?

17:11.508 --> 17:12.074
MIKE:
Molly!

17:12.161 --> 17:14.337
Please!

17:14.424 --> 17:15.164
You should at least
let her hit him once.

17:15.251 --> 17:16.165
Molly!

17:16.252 --> 17:18.472
That's right!

17:18.559 --> 17:20.213
You're gonna die,
you cheatin' son of a bitch!

17:20.300 --> 17:21.257
CARL:
Hey, hey, hey!Bat down! Molly, go!

17:21.344 --> 17:22.911
Hey, I need a little backup!

17:22.998 --> 17:24.913
Don't touch her!
I love her!

17:25.000 --> 17:25.783
[Carl yells]

17:25.870 --> 17:27.307
She's biting me!

17:27.394 --> 17:29.309
I can't believe
you're biting me!

17:29.396 --> 17:30.788
[yelling over each other]

17:38.927 --> 17:42.061
[laughing]
Oh, wow!

17:42.148 --> 17:43.801
Wow, that was
incredible.

17:43.888 --> 17:46.369
I should bring you
to work more often.
[giggles]

17:46.456 --> 17:47.936
Say that thing
I like again.

17:48.023 --> 17:49.329
As a police officer,

17:49.416 --> 17:50.765
I'm ordering you
back into that vehicle.

17:50.852 --> 17:52.419
Oh!

17:52.506 --> 17:55.204
God, I love it when
I let you boss me around.

17:55.291 --> 17:57.554
Well, the boss man's
fading fast.

17:57.641 --> 17:58.947
Anything else
you want to say?

17:59.034 --> 17:59.904
Yeah, I just
want to say

17:59.991 --> 18:01.471
how lucky I am

18:01.558 --> 18:04.996
to have such
a supportive husband, and...

18:05.084 --> 18:07.347
I love you
very much.

18:07.434 --> 18:09.305
Mm-hmm.

18:09.392 --> 18:12.134
[whispering]:
I know that means
you love me, too.

18:15.224 --> 18:17.183
[snoring]

18:25.408 --> 18:28.281
MOLLY:
It was another brutal
Chicago summer.

18:28.368 --> 18:33.634
The sun beat down
with the kind of heat

18:33.721 --> 18:35.418
that drives good men bad.

18:35.505 --> 18:37.290
[chuckles]

18:37.377 --> 18:38.900
But there was one person

18:38.987 --> 18:40.641
keeping things cool

18:40.728 --> 18:42.686
on those steamy streets:

18:42.773 --> 18:45.211
Officer Millie Briggs.

18:47.169 --> 18:48.214
You. Car. Now.

18:50.738 --> 18:52.653
I just put you in jail.

18:52.740 --> 18:55.003
Why are you back peddlin'
your junk on my streets?

18:55.090 --> 18:56.874
'Cause the system's
broken, Briggs.

18:56.961 --> 18:59.877
You keep putting me in,
they keep letting me out.

18:59.964 --> 19:01.488
Hakuna matata.

19:01.575 --> 19:04.447
I catch you hanging
around that school again,

19:04.534 --> 19:06.362
you and I are gonna
have a problem.

19:06.449 --> 19:07.363
Ooh, what?

19:07.450 --> 19:08.930
You gonna shoot me?

19:09.017 --> 19:09.931
No.

19:10.018 --> 19:11.585
System won't let me.

19:11.672 --> 19:13.021
Like you said, it's broken.

19:13.108 --> 19:14.153
What I can do
is tell you to take

19:14.240 --> 19:16.807
three steps away from my car.

19:16.894 --> 19:18.157
What you gonna do, Briggs?

19:18.244 --> 19:19.984
Take my picture?

19:20.071 --> 19:21.508
Say cheese.

19:21.595 --> 19:23.074
Cheese...

19:28.210 --> 19:30.517
Sometimes to keep a city clean,

19:30.604 --> 19:32.562
you gotta get a little dirty.

19:36.349 --> 19:38.133
Oh, boy, I got a lot
of anger inside.
