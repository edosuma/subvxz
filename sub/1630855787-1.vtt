14:36.501 --> 14:39.045
And it's not because he's
in the car park business.

of my biggest investors.

14:52.058 --> 14:53.518

14:53.560 --> 14:56.062
Come to think of it...

you mind saying a quick hello

15:21.296 --> 15:24.132
Yes.
Yes, that Davenport.

Uh, well, no,

Frankie was supposed to
pick it up,

50:01.918 --> 50:03.712
but he never showed.

50:03.753 --> 50:05.005
Lemmy ended up getting hurt.

50:05.046 --> 50:07.382
- Shot in my perineum.

50:08.633 --> 50:10.844
Right in between
my balls and my ass.

50:10.885 --> 50:13.513
- Lost my product, my money.

50:13.555 --> 50:15.640
Wasn't the first time
your brother fucked up.

50:15.682 --> 50:17.851
- Yeah, and that's
the last saw of him?

50:17.892 --> 50:20.353
- Yeah, if he'd actually
showed up that night.

50:20.395 --> 50:21.813
A little while after that,

50:21.855 --> 50:25.191
I heard from a buyer that
he, uh, moved into a hotel.

50:27.027 --> 50:29.821
- The Continental.
- So you know what kinda people

50:29.863 --> 50:31.322
are holed up in that place?

50:32.532 --> 50:34.367
- Most of the guys over there

50:34.409 --> 50:36.953
had to get used to
all the killing.

50:36.995 --> 50:38.830
But Frankie just took to it.

50:39.748 --> 50:42.500
There's people that just
pick things up and can do it.

50:42.542 --> 50:45.211
If he picked up a gun, a knife,

50:45.253 --> 50:48.131
shit, anything you see here,

50:48.173 --> 50:50.216
the gun's gon' be
trying to keep up with him.

50:50.258 --> 50:52.635
- Well, that's a hell of
a thing to be good at.

50:52.677 --> 50:54.763
Were you close with him
over there?

50:56.765 --> 50:59.601
- Saving each other's lives
enough times'll do that.

50:59.642 --> 51:02.228
If you need someone in
charge of saving your life,

51:02.270 --> 51:04.022
I'll take Frankie every time.

51:04.064 --> 51:05.398
- Every time.

51:06.691 --> 51:08.026

seemed like he was

51:08.068 --> 51:10.028

straightened out.

51:10.070 --> 51:12.739
Met a girl overseas,
cleaned up,

51:12.781 --> 51:16.242
started talking all this
hippy dippy stuff about fate.

51:17.619 --> 51:18.953
Then he lands
in New York and ends up

51:18.995 --> 51:20.663
getting into some shit.

51:22.248 --> 51:24.751
- I'm starting to
see what that's like.

51:25.627 --> 51:27.462
- You ain't the only one
looking for him, you know.

51:27.504 --> 51:30.173
- Guy like Frankie,
a skill set like he's got--

51:30.215 --> 51:31.508
you're not gonna find him

51:31.549 --> 51:33.301
unless he wants you
to find him.

51:33.343 --> 51:37.263
He's like Casper,
the...unfriendly ghost.

51:39.349 --> 51:40.975
- Well, I have to
start somewhere.

51:41.017 --> 51:43.937
- Well, he used to roll around
down in Alphabet City.

outsmart the High Table?

53:30.418 --> 53:32.671
How foolish of you.

53:32.712 --> 53:34.589
- I'm telling you the truth.

53:36.549 --> 53:40.887
I got paid to do a job,
and that job got fucked up.

left me in there to die.

Are you even aware of

53:56.653 --> 54:00.657
May I ask you how much
you got paid to steal it?
