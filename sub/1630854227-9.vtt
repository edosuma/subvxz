WEBVTT

00:02.915 --> 00:03.960
JIN SHEN WANTS YOU TO BELIEVE

00:03.960 --> 00:05.527
HE'S A SIMPLE FAMILY MAN

00:05.527 --> 00:07.703
WHO WANTS TO PROTECT
HIS COMMUNITY.

00:07.703 --> 00:09.966
OUTSOURCING POLICING

00:09.966 --> 00:13.230
IS NOT THE ANSWER TO OUR
COMMUNITY'S PROBLEMS.

00:13.230 --> 00:15.102
BUT HE'S HIDING SOMETHING,

00:15.102 --> 00:17.104
PROTECTING
HIS DAUGHTER'S SECRET.

00:19.280 --> 00:21.412
WHAT ELSE IS JIN SHEN HIDING?

00:26.678 --> 00:28.332
HYAH! HYAH!

00:28.332 --> 00:30.639
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

00:30.639 --> 00:33.033
VOTE FOR
THE CANDIDATE YOU CAN TRUST.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.425
VOTE FOR ANTHONY CHAN.

00:34.425 --> 00:36.079
I'M ANTHONY CHAN,

00:36.079 --> 00:37.646
AND I APPROVE
THIS MESSAGE.

00:40.475 --> 00:42.912
HE CANNOT DO THAT.
CAN HE?

00:42.912 --> 00:45.088
ALREADY HAS.
THE AD'S
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

00:45.088 --> 00:48.309
IT'S ALL LIES.
NICKY DOESN'T HURT PEOPLE.

00:48.309 --> 00:49.745
SHE HELPS PEOPLE.

00:49.745 --> 00:53.270
LAO GONG,
WE HAVE TO FIGHT THIS.

00:53.270 --> 00:54.880
SO, ANTHONY CALLS NICKY
A CRIMINAL

00:54.880 --> 00:56.491
WHILE HE'S PAYING OFF
DRUG DEALERS?

00:56.491 --> 00:58.014
YOU'RE SITTING ON
ALL THAT DIRT.

00:58.014 --> 01:00.538
WE SHOULD FIGHT FIRE
WITH FIRE.

01:00.538 --> 01:02.149
I'M MAD, TOO.

01:03.411 --> 01:06.196
BUT I'M NOT GONNA
LET HIM DRAG US DOWN.

01:06.196 --> 01:07.763
I'M NOT GOING THERE.

01:07.763 --> 01:09.373
BABA, THIS WILL HURT
YOUR CAMPAIGN.

01:09.373 --> 01:11.158
SWEETIE,
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

01:11.158 --> 01:13.551
WHAT YOU DO FOR
THIS CITY EVERY DAY,

01:13.551 --> 01:15.901
THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE ASHAMED OF.

01:17.773 --> 01:20.210
NICKY, YOU OK?

01:20.210 --> 01:21.603
YEAH, I'M FINE.

01:21.603 --> 01:24.475
THERE'S NO USE
DWELLING, RIGHT?

01:24.475 --> 01:27.217
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
GOT A CLASS TO TEACH.

01:33.571 --> 01:34.964
LAO PO.

01:34.964 --> 01:37.358
MM. MM.

01:37.358 --> 01:41.013
LAO GONG, THAT AD.

01:41.013 --> 01:44.800
I KNOW OUR DAUGHTER.
SHE IS NOT OK.

01:44.800 --> 01:47.019
I KNOW, I KNOW.

01:47.019 --> 01:49.283
IT'S NOT JUST THE AD.

01:49.283 --> 01:53.591
YOU KNOW, IT'S
WHAT HAPPENED TO
HER SHIFU, WITH BO.

01:53.591 --> 01:55.419
YEAH, BUT THAT AD,

01:55.419 --> 01:58.335
IT'S SOMETHING THAT
WE CAN ACTUALLY
DO SOMETHING ABOUT.

01:58.335 --> 02:01.817
WELL, THERE'S ONE WAY
TO STOP THOSE ADS.

02:03.340 --> 02:07.214
WHEN I STARTED THIS,
I MADE A PROMISE

02:07.214 --> 02:09.433
THAT NOTHING WILL
HAPPEN TO THIS FAMILY.

02:09.433 --> 02:14.612
UH--NO, NO. YOU ARE NOT
DROPPING OUT OF THAT RACE,

02:14.612 --> 02:15.918
NOT NOW.

02:15.918 --> 02:18.268
THAT DISGUSTING AD
JUST PROVES IT.

02:18.268 --> 02:21.184
WE NEED NEW LEADERS.

02:21.184 --> 02:23.360
WE NEED YOU.

02:23.360 --> 02:24.753
YOU TAKE CARE
OF THE COMMUNITY,

02:24.753 --> 02:26.537
AND I WILL TAKE CARE
OF THE FAMILY.

02:33.675 --> 02:35.677
HOW'S EVERYONE?

02:35.677 --> 02:37.635
I USED TO IMAGINE
MY FAMILY GETTING
FAMOUS ONE DAY.

02:37.635 --> 02:40.464
THIS IS NOT
WHAT I HAD IN MIND.

02:41.944 --> 02:43.815
OH. WHAT IS THIS?

02:43.815 --> 02:45.774
THE BEST ESPRESSO MACHINE
MONEY CAN BUY.

02:45.774 --> 02:49.125
DUAL P.I.D. TEMPERATURE
CONTROL, BUILT-IN WI-FI.

02:49.125 --> 02:52.520
UH, SOUNDS EXPENSIVE.
OH, YEAH.

02:52.520 --> 02:54.696
THIS BABY RETAILS
FOR ALMOST 5 GRAND.

02:55.914 --> 02:58.134
A GIFT
FROM MY PARENTS.

02:58.134 --> 03:00.528
WELL, EXTRAVAGANT
BUT THOUGHTFUL.

03:00.528 --> 03:02.878
AT LEAST YOUR PARENTS
ARE LISTENING TO YOU.

03:02.878 --> 03:04.445
THEY'RE TRYING
TO BUY ME BACK.

03:04.445 --> 03:06.925
I KNOW THAT THIS IS
JUST THE BEGINNING.

03:08.275 --> 03:11.713
WELL, WE'VE MADE IT
THROUGH 4 MONTHS OF
BURNT COFFEE.

03:11.713 --> 03:13.323
WHAT'S ANOTHER 4?

03:15.543 --> 03:17.675
RETURN IT.

03:17.675 --> 03:19.329
TELL YOUR PARENTS THAT

03:19.329 --> 03:23.246
DENNIS SOONG
CANNOT BE BOUGHT, HMM?

03:37.434 --> 03:39.784
SETTLE DOWN.

03:39.784 --> 03:44.136
GET YOUR HANDS OFF
ME! I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. AAH!

03:44.136 --> 03:46.356
DAMIAN?

03:46.356 --> 03:50.142
HEY! RYAN, RYAN SHEN,
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!
YOU GOTTA HELP ME.

03:50.142 --> 03:51.753
YOU KNOW HIM?

03:51.753 --> 03:54.146
UH, YEAH.
FRIEND OF THE FAMILY.

03:57.628 --> 04:00.283
WHOA. UH, I NEED
TO ASSESS THE PATIENT.

04:00.283 --> 04:03.068
ONLY DR. FREDRICKSON'S
CLEARED TO SEE
THIS PATIENT.

04:14.776 --> 04:17.300
UH, WHERE IS EVERYONE?

04:17.300 --> 04:20.216
SHIFU, WE KNOW
IT ISN'T TRUE.

04:20.216 --> 04:22.523
THOSE ADS
MUST BE DOCTORED.

04:22.523 --> 04:24.351
YOU'RE SHAOLIN.

04:24.351 --> 04:26.178
YOU TELL US

04:26.178 --> 04:28.268
ONLY USE VIOLENCE
AS A LAST RESORT.

04:29.660 --> 04:30.705
YEAH.

04:32.402 --> 04:34.491
LET'S GET--UH,
LET'S GET STARTED.

04:49.071 --> 04:51.203
NICKY, VOICE-OVER: ONLY USE
VIOLENCE AS A LAST RESORT.

04:55.033 --> 04:56.557
LIAR!

04:57.558 --> 05:01.736
UHH! UHH! UHH! UHH!

05:05.479 --> 05:06.871
ARE YOU OK?

05:08.438 --> 05:10.222
SHIFU?
DON'T.

05:12.747 --> 05:14.792
DON'T CALL ME THAT.

05:22.931 --> 05:24.672
SORRY.
CLASS IS CANCELED.

06:01.448 --> 06:02.710
SHIFU.

06:20.162 --> 06:21.685
HEY, RYAN.
HEY, ALTHEA.

06:21.685 --> 06:23.295
I THINK I'M
ON TO SOMETHING.

06:23.295 --> 06:24.906
LIKE A CASE?

06:24.906 --> 06:26.777
UH, MAYBE.
I DON'T KNOW.

06:26.777 --> 06:29.040
I'M COVERING A SHIFT
AT HAYES MEMORIAL.

06:29.040 --> 06:31.391
DAMIAN WU WAS BROUGHT IN,
UNDER ARREST.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.480
NICKY HELPED HIM TURN
HIS LIFE AROUND LAST YEAR.

06:33.480 --> 06:35.438
UH, THEN WHY IS HE
AT THE E.R.?

06:35.438 --> 06:36.874
BROKEN ARM.
GUESS IT HAPPENED

06:36.874 --> 06:38.528
WHEN THE COPS
BUSTED HIM.

06:38.528 --> 06:39.964
HE WAS BEGGING
FOR HELP.

06:39.964 --> 06:41.966
HE SEEMS REALLY SCARED.
SOMETHING'S OFF.

06:41.966 --> 06:44.360
USUALLY WHEN A PATIENT
UNDER ARREST COMES IN,

06:44.360 --> 06:45.927
THEY'VE GOT A COP
GLUED TO THEIR SIDE.

06:45.927 --> 06:47.494
TO MAINTAIN
CHAIN OF CUSTODY.

06:47.494 --> 06:49.626
RIGHT.
BUT THE COPS BOUNCED

06:49.626 --> 06:51.933
AND LEFT DAMIAN WITH
THESE ARMED GUARDS.

06:51.933 --> 06:53.456
I SAW ONE OF
THEIR BADGES.

06:53.456 --> 06:54.631
IT SAID "DSE."

06:54.631 --> 06:56.372
DELTA SECURITY ENDEAVORS?

06:56.372 --> 06:57.939
YUP.

06:57.939 --> 06:59.984
ORDINANCE 11 WENT
INTO EFFECT THIS WEEK.

06:59.984 --> 07:02.509
THERE'S AN ODD CODE
IN DAMIAN'S CHART,
LIKE HE'S BEEN TAGGED,

07:02.509 --> 07:04.859
AND I'M 99% SURE
I SAW THE SAME CODE

07:04.859 --> 07:06.730
IN THE DELTA FILES
NADIA STOLE.

07:06.730 --> 07:07.862
TEXTING IT TO YOU.

07:09.429 --> 07:10.865
LOOKS LIKE YOUR
FREAKISHLY GOOD MEMORY

07:10.865 --> 07:12.388
ACTUALLY SERVES
A PURPOSE,

07:12.388 --> 07:13.998
WHEN YOU'RE NOT
USING IT FOR EVIL.

07:13.998 --> 07:15.522
I'M SORRY, ALTHEA.

07:15.522 --> 07:17.132
BEATING YOU AT GO FISH
IS NOT EVIL.

07:17.132 --> 07:18.916
UH, HOW ABOUT
HUSTLING ME OUT OF

07:18.916 --> 07:20.788
6 WEEKS' ALLOWANCE AND MY
SPICE GIRLS NOTEBOOK?

07:20.788 --> 07:23.704
WELL, I NEEDED SOMETHING
TO TALLY MY WINS.

07:23.704 --> 07:26.707
YEAH.
CODES ARE A MATCH.

07:26.707 --> 07:29.231
WHAT THE HELL ARE
DELTA CODES DOING
IN A PATIENT'S CHART?

07:29.231 --> 07:30.711
NO IDEA. BUT--

07:33.670 --> 07:36.064
AHEM. I CHECKED
THE HOSPITAL'S

07:36.064 --> 07:37.674
PATIENTS' FORMER RECORDS.

07:37.674 --> 07:39.371
THEY'VE BEEN TAGGED
WITH THE SAME CODE.

07:39.371 --> 07:41.809
WHATEVER'S GOING ON,
IT'S BIG.

07:49.643 --> 07:51.949
HI. ME AGAIN.
DR. RYAN SHEN.

07:51.949 --> 07:54.561
DR. FREDRICKSON
WANTED ME TO DISCUSS

07:54.561 --> 07:56.911
SOME SENSITIVE
MEDICAL INFORMATION
WITH THE PATIENT.

07:56.911 --> 07:59.522
TOLD YOU ALREADY.
OK, OK, COOL. COOL. AH!

07:59.522 --> 08:02.133
I JUST NEED
A VERBAL CONFIRMATION

08:02.133 --> 08:04.527
THAT YOU'RE AWARE
OF THE IMPLICATIONS

08:04.527 --> 08:06.442
OF DENYING A PATIENT
PROPER MEDICAL CARE.

08:06.442 --> 08:08.444
I MEAN, JUST SAYING,
HE STROKES OUT

08:08.444 --> 08:10.141
BECAUSE YOU
STOPPED ME FROM GETTING

08:10.141 --> 08:11.708
AN ACCURATE
MEDICAL HISTORY...

08:11.708 --> 08:14.755
YOU COULD GET SUED.

08:14.755 --> 08:17.584
A STROKE?
FROM A BROKEN ARM?

08:17.584 --> 08:19.542
I'M GUESSING YOU'RE UNFAMILIAR
WITH COMPARTMENT SYNDROME,

08:19.542 --> 08:22.110
NEUROPRAXIA, OSTEONECROSIS?

08:22.110 --> 08:24.460
THEY'RE JUST
A FEW LIFE-THREATENING
COMPLICATIONS

08:24.460 --> 08:26.244
THAT CAN RESULT
FROM A BROKEN ARM.

08:29.552 --> 08:30.771
ALL RIGHT.

08:34.296 --> 08:35.732
OK, THAT'S GONNA
BLOW UP IN MY FACE.

08:35.732 --> 08:37.255
TELL ME EVERYTHING FAST.

08:37.255 --> 08:39.475
COPS BUSTED INTO
MY APARTMENT LAST NIGHT.

08:39.475 --> 08:41.521
I WAS SLEEPING.
I PANICKED.

08:41.521 --> 08:43.871
RAN TO THE BACK STAIRS.
TUMBLED THE WHOLE
FLIGHT DOWN.

08:43.871 --> 08:45.655
THE NEXT THING I KNOW,
I'M UNDER ARREST.

08:45.655 --> 08:47.788
WELL, DO YOU KNOW WHY?
ARMED ROBBERY.

08:47.788 --> 08:49.833
THEY SAID THEY FOUND
A GUN IN MY APARTMENT

08:49.833 --> 08:51.574
THAT WAS USED TO ROB
A MARKET IN SOMA.

08:51.574 --> 08:53.576
I'VE NEVER EVEN
TOUCHED A GUN.

08:53.576 --> 08:55.447
YOU GOTTA TALK TO NICKY.
SHE'LL KNOW I'M INNOCENT.

08:55.447 --> 08:58.059
OK. DID THEY ASK YOU
ANY QUESTIONS,
READ YOUR RIGHTS?

08:58.059 --> 09:03.412
YEAH. BUT THEN THEY
MADE ME SIGN THIS--
THIS FORM.

09:03.412 --> 09:05.588
WHAT--WHAT KIND OF FORM?

09:05.588 --> 09:08.460
COPS SAID I COULD
GO TO JAIL OR...

09:08.460 --> 09:10.637
OR I COULD GO INTO
SOME SORT OF REHAB.

09:10.637 --> 09:13.596
I WAS SO OUT OF IT,
I SIGNED.

09:13.596 --> 09:17.034
I'M SCARED, MAN.
THOSE GUYS IN THE POLOS.

09:17.034 --> 09:19.341
WHAT?
I'VE SEEN THEM BEFORE.

09:19.341 --> 09:21.256
A FEW NIGHTS AGO,
HEADING BACK
FROM MY SHIFT.

09:21.256 --> 09:23.214
I THOUGHT THEY WERE
FOLLOWING ME,

09:23.214 --> 09:24.607
BUT I FIGURED
I WAS JUST BEING
PARANOID, YOU KNOW?

09:24.607 --> 09:26.522
BUT THEN THEY
SHOW UP HERE

09:26.522 --> 09:28.176
AND THE COPS JUST
HAND ME OVER TO THEM?

09:28.176 --> 09:30.700
RYAN, MAN, YOU CAN'T
LET THEM TAKE ME.

09:30.700 --> 09:32.833
I--

09:32.833 --> 09:34.138
OH. DR. FREDRICKSON.

09:34.138 --> 09:35.749
DR. SHEN.

09:35.749 --> 09:39.274
I DON'T RECALL ASSIGNING
YOU TO THIS PATIENT.

09:39.274 --> 09:41.624
I SUGGEST YOU
GET BACK TO WORK.

09:41.624 --> 09:43.670
RIGHT. I JUST--
NOW.

09:49.110 --> 09:50.764
WHY ARE YOU
GIVING ME THESE?

09:52.156 --> 09:54.594
I NEED YOU TO TAKE OVER
THE HUNT FOR XIAO,

09:54.594 --> 09:56.247
COVER ME FOR A WHILE.

09:57.509 --> 10:00.382
NICKY.
I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS.

10:00.382 --> 10:02.558
SAVING PEI-LING IS
WAY TOO IMPORTANT
TO GIVE UP,

10:02.558 --> 10:06.518
BUT I CAN'T DO THIS
RIGHT NOW.

10:06.518 --> 10:08.520
I CAN'T BE THE LEADER.

10:08.520 --> 10:10.131
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

10:10.131 --> 10:13.221
I DON'T KNOW.

10:13.221 --> 10:17.225
I WISH THERE WAS A...PLACE,

10:17.225 --> 10:20.141
SOMEWHERE TO GO, HIDE.

10:21.882 --> 10:24.928
I CAN'T STAND
BEING LOOKED AT
RIGHT NOW BY ANYONE.

10:24.928 --> 10:29.019
LOOK, YOU LOST YOUR SHIFU.
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES--

10:29.019 --> 10:30.586
NO. YOU--YOU SAW BO.

10:32.588 --> 10:35.417
WHAT I DID TO HIM,
I COMPLETELY LOST CONTROL.

10:37.114 --> 10:39.769
I CALLED THE HOSPITAL
IN OAKLAND.

10:39.769 --> 10:41.815
BO REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS
A FEW HOURS AGO.

10:41.815 --> 10:43.817
LOOK, HE'S GONNA BE OK.

10:43.817 --> 10:47.168
STILL, I--I VIOLATED
MY PRINCIPLES--

10:47.168 --> 10:49.997
EVERYTHING I BELIEVE IN,
EVERYTHING PEI-LING
TAUGHT ME.

10:52.129 --> 10:53.696
RIGHT NOW, THE WHOLE
CITY'S LOOKING AT ME

10:53.696 --> 10:55.437
LIKE I'M SOME
KIND OF MONSTER.

10:57.613 --> 10:59.702
AND THE THING IS
I FEEL LIKE THEY'RE RIGHT.

11:10.931 --> 11:13.716
HEY, RYAN.
NICKY, I NEED YOUR HELP.

11:17.981 --> 11:19.243
NICKY.

11:22.116 --> 11:24.161
I'M SORRY.
I TRIED TO GIVE YOU
SOME SPACE,

11:24.161 --> 11:26.163
BUT DAMIAN'S REALLY FREAKED.

11:26.163 --> 11:28.252
HE ASKED FOR YOU.
HE SAYS YOU SAVED HIS LIFE.

11:28.252 --> 11:30.515
WHERE IS HE?
THIS WAY.

11:30.515 --> 11:31.995
I KEPT TABS ON DAMIAN.

11:31.995 --> 11:33.518
I KNOW HE WAS
STAYING OUT OF TROUBLE.

11:33.518 --> 11:34.998
I REALLY THINK
HE WAS.

11:34.998 --> 11:36.565
DAMIAN SAID DELTA
WAS SPYING ON HIM

11:36.565 --> 11:38.393
DAYS BEFORE THE ROBBERY
EVEN HAPPENED.

11:38.393 --> 11:40.264
SOMETHING'S GOING ON.

11:40.264 --> 11:42.658
MEATHEAD IN THERE WON'T
JUST LET YOU WALK IN.

12:04.201 --> 12:07.074
NADIA SAID THE COPS
HAD A BUNCH OF EVIDENCE
AGAINST DAMIAN,

12:07.074 --> 12:09.641
MOSTLY SURVEILLANCE VIDEO
OF HIM NEAR THE MARKET.

12:09.641 --> 12:12.688
SURVEILLANCE VIDEO
RECORDED BY DELTA
SECURITY ENDEAVORS?

12:12.688 --> 12:14.734
THOSE CAMERAS THEY'VE
BEEN PUTTING UP
ALL OVER THE CITY?

12:14.734 --> 12:16.518
COULD BE.
WHATEVER IT WAS,

12:16.518 --> 12:18.041
IT WAS ENOUGH
FOR A SEARCH WARRANT.

12:18.041 --> 12:19.651
THEN DAMIAN
PANICKED AND FLED,

12:19.651 --> 12:21.175
AND THEN THEY FOUND
EVIDENCE AT HIS PLACE

12:21.175 --> 12:22.611
AND THAT WAS
ENOUGH FOR THE ARREST.

12:22.611 --> 12:24.265
HOW CAN THE COPS
AND THE HOSPITAL

12:24.265 --> 12:26.136
JUST HAND DAMIAN OVER
TO DELTA'S CUSTODY?

12:26.136 --> 12:28.791
THAT FORM HE SIGNED,
IT WAS A PLEA AGREEMENT.

12:28.791 --> 12:30.097
IT'S PERFECTLY LEGAL.

12:30.097 --> 12:31.794
NADIA GOT US A COPY.

12:31.794 --> 12:33.230
HE WAIVED HIS RIGHT
TO A JURY TRIAL

12:33.230 --> 12:35.493
IN EXCHANGE
FOR A LESSER SENTENCE--

12:35.493 --> 12:38.192
VOLUNTARY RELEASE
INTO DELTA'S NEW
REHABILITATION PROGRAM.

12:38.192 --> 12:39.802
RYAN SAID DAMIAN
SIGNED THIS

12:39.802 --> 12:41.717
WHEN HE WAS
HALF-CONSCIOUS,
INJURED,

12:41.717 --> 12:43.588
TERRIFIED IN THE BACK
OF A SQUAD CAR.

12:43.588 --> 12:45.112
REAL VOLUNTARY.

12:45.112 --> 12:47.157
ORDINANCE 11 UNLOCKED
A TON OF CASH

12:47.157 --> 12:49.769
FOR PRETRIAL
DIVERSION PROGRAMS.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.683
THEY CAN DO
A LOT OF GOOD,

12:51.683 --> 12:53.511
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE
THE CITY'S FUNNELING

12:53.511 --> 12:56.601
MOST OF THOSE FUNDS
RIGHT BACK INTO
THIS DELTA PROGRAM.

12:56.601 --> 12:58.821
AND DELTA'S POCKETS.

12:58.821 --> 13:00.257
THIS IS
DELTA SECURITY
ENDEAVORS' CEO,

13:00.257 --> 13:01.606
DAVID WHEELER.

13:01.606 --> 13:03.347
HE'S A SELF-STYLED
DATA WHIZ.

13:03.347 --> 13:05.828
HE'S OBSESSED
WITH NUMBERS, STATISTICS,

13:05.828 --> 13:07.830
MONEY.

13:07.830 --> 13:09.440
IT'S CLEAR IN
THE INTERVIEW THAT
SF IS GROUND ZERO.

13:09.440 --> 13:11.312
SUCCEED HERE,
THEN THEY CAN SELL

13:11.312 --> 13:12.879
THEIR SECURITY SERVICES
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

13:12.879 --> 13:15.142
WHEELER SAYS POINT BLANK
THAT HE WILL DO ANYTHING

13:15.142 --> 13:18.885
TO INCREASE DELTA'S
IMPACT AND SCOPE
ACROSS THE CITY.

13:18.885 --> 13:22.671
ANYTHING, HUH?

13:22.671 --> 13:24.586
OK. RYAN SAID DAMIAN

13:24.586 --> 13:26.153
WAS BEING FOLLOWED
BY DELTA GOONS.

13:26.153 --> 13:28.590
HIS MEDICAL RECORDS
WERE EVEN TAGGED BY DELTA

13:28.590 --> 13:30.635
DAYS BEFORE THE ARREST.

13:30.635 --> 13:32.594
IT'S LIKE THEY'RE
TARGETING HIM

13:32.594 --> 13:34.552
FOR THIS NEW REHAB PROGRAM.

13:34.552 --> 13:36.859
IF THIS WHEELER GUY'S
AS RUTHLESS AS HE SOUNDS,

13:36.859 --> 13:38.774
MAYBE DELTA FRAMED DAMIAN.

13:46.477 --> 13:47.870
WHO'S THAT FROM?

13:47.870 --> 13:49.524
MRS. SOONG.

13:49.524 --> 13:52.309
A CONGRATULATORY GIFT
FOR MY NEW P.I. JOB.

13:53.876 --> 13:55.312
DO YOU SEE THIS?

13:55.312 --> 13:56.792
YEAH.

13:56.792 --> 13:58.446
THIS IS EXQUISITE.

13:58.446 --> 13:59.839
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

13:59.839 --> 14:01.710
THE PROBLEM IS
I LOVE IT.

14:04.408 --> 14:06.062
WE AGREED NOT TO ACCEPT

14:06.062 --> 14:07.585
ANY BIG-TICKET ITEMS
FROM THEM,

14:07.585 --> 14:10.240
BUT I HAD NO IDEA THEY'D
BE SENDING ME THIS.

14:12.286 --> 14:13.853
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

14:13.853 --> 14:16.507
CAN YOU HELP?

14:16.507 --> 14:18.074
GIVE ME SOME OF THAT
SHAOLIN WISDOM.

14:18.074 --> 14:20.555
I, UM...I'M NOT FEELING

14:20.555 --> 14:23.601
VERY SHAOLIN AT THE MOMENT.

14:23.601 --> 14:26.735
OK, BUT SINCE YOU ASKED,

14:26.735 --> 14:30.173
MAYBE TRY ASKING YOURSELF,

14:30.173 --> 14:32.436
"WILL THIS BRING ME
LASTING HAPPINESS?"

14:39.704 --> 14:41.881
MEI-LI, HI.
I'M ON MY WAY OUT.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.405
ANTHONY, I JUST
WANT TO TALK.

14:44.405 --> 14:45.972
SORRY. NOW IS NOT
A GREAT TIME.

14:45.972 --> 14:47.930
MY STAFF IS WAITING.
STRATEGY SESSION.

14:47.930 --> 14:51.107
YEAH, WELL,
I SUPPOSE WE CAN
DISCUSS THIS PUBLICLY,

14:51.107 --> 14:52.979
PERHAPS AT YOUR NEXT
CAMPAIGN EVENT?

14:52.979 --> 14:55.285
JIN DID TELL ME
HOW MUCH YOU ENJOY

14:55.285 --> 14:57.940
OPEN DIALOGUE
IN FRONT OF YOUR
POTENTIAL VOTERS.

14:57.940 --> 15:00.725
LOOK, I GET
WHY YOU'RE UPSET.

15:00.725 --> 15:03.728
YOU MEAN FOR
ATTACKING MY FAMILY

15:03.728 --> 15:05.643
AND TURNING MY DAUGHTER,
WHO HAS SACRIFICED

15:05.643 --> 15:08.516
SO MUCH FOR THIS CITY,
INTO SOME SORT OF VILLAIN?

15:08.516 --> 15:11.301
IT'S POLITICS, MEI-LI.

15:11.301 --> 15:14.609
NOTHING'S OFF-LIMITS,
NOT EVEN FAMILY.

15:14.609 --> 15:17.568
ON THAT POINT, I AGREE.

15:17.568 --> 15:19.135
ANTHONY?

15:19.135 --> 15:20.832
MAMA?

15:22.573 --> 15:25.141
MEI-LI TOLD ME ABOUT
YOUR TELEVISION ADS.

15:25.141 --> 15:26.751
ATTACKING SOME OF
OUR OLDEST FRIENDS?

15:26.751 --> 15:28.188
HOW COULD YOU?

15:35.673 --> 15:37.414
ANY LUCK FINDING DAMIAN?

15:37.414 --> 15:39.329
NOT YET.
LOCAL PRESS HAS
BARELY COVERED

15:39.329 --> 15:41.375
OUR NEW
POST-ORDINANCE 11 REALITY.

15:41.375 --> 15:44.639
CAN'T FIND ANYTHING
ON THESE DELTA-OWNED
REHAB FACILITIES.

15:44.639 --> 15:46.771
DELTA'S PICKED UP
A LOT OF REAL ESTATE
POST-EARTHQUAKE.

15:46.771 --> 15:49.122
NO IDEA WHERE THEY'RE
SETTING UP SHOP.

15:49.122 --> 15:50.645
JUST TALKED
TO NADIA.

15:50.645 --> 15:52.473
SHE GOT THE D.A.
TO PUT IN A REQUEST

15:52.473 --> 15:54.562
FOR INFORMATION
ABOUT EXACTLY WHERE
DAMIAN'S BEING HELD.

15:54.562 --> 15:57.695
UNFORTUNATELY,
DELTA'S SLOW-ROLLING
THEIR RESPONSE,

15:57.695 --> 15:59.349
AND IT COULD TAKE DAYS
BEFORE WE GET AN ANSWER.

15:59.349 --> 16:00.960
WE DON'T HAVE DAYS.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.962
DAMIAN WAS
ON THE RIGHT PATH,

16:02.962 --> 16:05.051
GETTING
HIS LIFE TOGETHER.

16:05.051 --> 16:07.967
NOW DELTA'S
HOLDING HIM AT SOME
QUASI-LEGAL BLACK SITE

16:07.967 --> 16:10.360
AGAINST HIS WILL
ON FALSE CHARGES.

16:10.360 --> 16:12.362
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE HE
IS. THE CITY DOESN'T EVEN
KNOW. ONLY DELTA DOES.

16:12.362 --> 16:13.973
WE'VE ALREADY TRIED
HACKING THEM.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.713
THEIR SYSTEMS
ARE TOO STRONG.

16:15.713 --> 16:18.455
WELL, WE'VE ONLY TRIED
HACKING THEM

16:18.455 --> 16:21.154
THROUGH A REMOTE SYSTEM.

16:21.154 --> 16:22.851
THANKS TO EVAN, WE KNOW

16:22.851 --> 16:25.201
WHERE MOST OF DELTA'S FANCY
NEW SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS

16:25.201 --> 16:27.073
HAVE BEEN PUT UP
AROUND THE CITY.

16:27.073 --> 16:28.900
IF WE TAMPER
WITH ONE OF THE CAMERAS,

16:28.900 --> 16:30.859
PULL THE RIGHT CABLE,
IT MIGHT MAKE THE SYSTEM

16:30.859 --> 16:33.383
VULNERABLE ENOUGH
FOR US TO HACK INTO
THE FEED'S TRANSMISSION.

16:33.383 --> 16:35.516
YOU THINK THAT'LL
GET US INTO
DELTA'S SYSTEM?

16:35.516 --> 16:37.605
IT'S WORTH A SHOT.

16:37.605 --> 16:39.041
THE APOTHECARY BAR
HAS TWO CAMERAS
COVERING IT,

16:39.041 --> 16:40.956
DUAL ANGLES.

16:40.956 --> 16:42.610
WE COULD ACCESS
ONE OF THE CAMERAS
EASILY ENOUGH.

16:42.610 --> 16:44.394
DELTA WOULD HAVE
EYES ON US THE WHOLE TIME.

16:44.394 --> 16:46.266
THEY'D CATCH US
BEFORE WE EVEN START.

16:46.266 --> 16:49.182
NOT IF WE GIVE THEM
SOMETHING ELSE
TO LOOK AT.

16:56.624 --> 16:58.147
READY WHEN YOU ARE.

17:13.423 --> 17:15.034
CAMERA ONE IS BLINDED.

17:33.269 --> 17:35.097
WHICH ONE, ALTHEA?

17:35.097 --> 17:36.881
THE CAT5 CABLE,
THE RED ONE.

17:41.234 --> 17:43.366
OK.

17:43.366 --> 17:45.325
AND WE'RE IN. OK.

17:45.325 --> 17:47.675
NAVIGATE TO
THE SHELL SCRIPT
IN THE CGI-BIN,

17:47.675 --> 17:50.678
THEN REWRITE
THE QUERY STRING
TO FORCE A REBOOT.

17:50.678 --> 17:53.811
HMM. EVERY COMPANY
HAS AT LEAST
ONE LAZY CODER.

17:53.811 --> 17:56.988
UH, GUYS?
CLOUDS ARE COMING IN.

17:56.988 --> 17:58.555
I'M LOSING SUNLIGHT FAST.

18:01.167 --> 18:03.125
DENNIS, WE NEED YOU TO BUY
A LITTLE MORE TIME FOR NICKY.

18:03.125 --> 18:04.953
EVAN,
CAN'T YOU JUST--

18:04.953 --> 18:06.650
ALTHEA, UNTIL RECENTLY,
THE ONLY EXPERIENCE

18:06.650 --> 18:08.391
I'VE HAD WITH HACKERS
WAS PUTTING THEM AWAY.

18:08.391 --> 18:10.915
I AM GOING
AS FAST AS I CAN.

18:22.710 --> 18:24.755

GOOD JOB.

19:35.826 --> 19:38.177
IT'S JUST
HOW POLITICS WORKS.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.700
I'VE HEARD YOU OUT, SON.

19:39.700 --> 19:42.529
NOTHING YOU SAY
EXCUSES YOUR BEHAVIOR.

19:42.529 --> 19:45.227
YOU OWE THE SHENS
AN APOLOGY,

19:45.227 --> 19:47.316
AND YOU CAN START
WITH MEI-LI.

19:47.316 --> 19:49.884
CAROL, IF I MAY.

19:49.884 --> 19:52.495
ANTHONY, I DON'T
NEED ANY APOLOGY.

19:52.495 --> 19:55.629
I JUST NEED YOU TO
TAKE OUT THOSE ADS.

19:55.629 --> 19:58.066
YOU HEARD HER. DO IT.

19:58.066 --> 20:00.895
OR CALL WHOEVER
YOU HAVE TO. I'LL WAIT.

20:00.895 --> 20:02.288
THE CAMPAIGN--

20:02.288 --> 20:04.246
YOUR CAMPAIGN, YOUR DECISION.

20:04.246 --> 20:06.030
NO, IT'S NOT.

20:15.649 --> 20:17.303
THE AD WASN'T MY IDEA.

20:17.303 --> 20:20.175
AND IT WASN'T
MY CHOICE.

20:20.175 --> 20:21.698
I WAS FORCED TO RUN IT.

20:21.698 --> 20:24.832
FORCED?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

20:24.832 --> 20:27.965
THE BLACKMAIL.
JIN TOLD ME.

20:27.965 --> 20:29.619
ARE THEY STILL
CONTROLLING YOU?

20:29.619 --> 20:31.926
BLACKMAIL?

20:31.926 --> 20:35.016
WHAT COULD ANYONE
POSSIBLY HAVE OVER YOU?

20:35.016 --> 20:36.670
RICHARD, MAMA.

20:38.062 --> 20:40.587
YOUR BROTHER?

20:40.587 --> 20:42.719
WE TOOK CARE OF
ALL THAT.

20:42.719 --> 20:44.634
I GOT HIM
THE HELP HE NEEDED.

20:44.634 --> 20:46.375
THE MESS HE MADE--

20:46.375 --> 20:47.942
IT'S BIGGER THAN
HE LET YOU KNOW.

20:49.552 --> 20:54.601
CLEANING IT UP,
I HAD TO GET DIRTY.

20:54.601 --> 20:56.951
NOW, CERTAIN PEOPLE

20:56.951 --> 20:58.779
ARE USING IT
TO GET THEIR WAY.

20:58.779 --> 21:01.303
DELTA SECURITY ENDEAVORS.

21:02.957 --> 21:05.351
BUT WHY WOULD THEY
GO THROUGH ALL THAT TROUBLE

21:05.351 --> 21:07.353
JUST TO TAKE
JIN'S CAMPAIGN DOWN?

21:07.353 --> 21:09.137
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT
BEATING JIN.

21:10.573 --> 21:12.967
THEY WERE VERY SPECIFIC

21:12.967 --> 21:15.012
ABOUT THE ATTACK
THEY WANTED ME TO RUN.

21:17.493 --> 21:19.452
DELTA WANTS
TO TAKE NICKY DOWN.

21:28.591 --> 21:30.071
NOW RUN
THE I.P. ADDRESS
TO MAP THE NETWORK.

21:30.071 --> 21:31.333
USE THE SNMP TO RUN
A PORT SCAN

21:31.333 --> 21:33.988
BY TARGETING
THE I.P. RANGE. HUH.

21:33.988 --> 21:35.511
WHAT?

21:35.511 --> 21:37.121
WELL, DELTA'S
CODE OBFUSCATION.

21:37.121 --> 21:38.775
THEIR DATA'S UNREACHABLE.

21:38.775 --> 21:41.648
WHAT--WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
YOU CAN'T FIND DAMIAN?

21:41.648 --> 21:43.432
SO WE GOT NOTHING
AFTER ALL THAT?

21:43.432 --> 21:45.173
NOT NOTHING.
I SEE DELTA'S GOT

21:45.173 --> 21:47.088
ONE ACTIVE PORT WITH
A SIGNIFICANT POWER DRAW.

21:47.088 --> 21:48.742
WHAT DOES THAT
TELL US?

21:48.742 --> 21:50.265
WELL, OUT OF
THE 20 OR SO PROPERTIES

21:50.265 --> 21:51.745
THAT DELTA'S ACQUIRED
AROUND THE CITY,

21:51.745 --> 21:53.355
THIS HAS TO BE THEIR HUB,

21:53.355 --> 21:55.401
WHERE THEY'RE STORING
ALL THEIR DATA.

21:55.401 --> 21:57.141
IF WE COULD
GET INSIDE DELTA'S HQ

21:57.141 --> 21:58.752
AND INTO THEIR MAINFRAME--

21:58.752 --> 22:00.362
I COULD LOCATE
THE REHAB FACILITY.

22:00.362 --> 22:02.538
POTENTIALLY
A WHOLE LOT MORE.

22:02.538 --> 22:04.279
YOU'D BASICALLY BE
INSIDE DELTA'S BRAIN.

22:04.279 --> 22:05.802
HELLO?

22:07.587 --> 22:10.764
FIGURED A CELEBRATION
ROUND WAS IN ORDER.

22:10.764 --> 22:13.070
MM-HMM.

22:15.290 --> 22:17.379
SEE WHAT I DID THERE?
WITH THE BALLOONS?

22:17.379 --> 22:20.817
YOU DID GREAT.
BUT I HAVE ONE MORE
FAVOR TO ASK.

22:22.036 --> 22:23.820
ANOTHER GIFT
FROM YOUR PARENTS.

22:23.820 --> 22:25.561
I NEED YOU
TO RETURN IT FOR ME.

22:26.954 --> 22:28.608
YOU SURE?
THIS BAG IS--

22:28.608 --> 22:30.784
EXQUISITE.

22:30.784 --> 22:32.568
BUT UPON
FURTHER REFLECTION,

22:32.568 --> 22:35.179
I KNOW THIS BAG
WILL NOT BRING ME
LASTING HAPPINESS.

22:39.270 --> 22:40.402
YOU OK?

22:40.402 --> 22:42.883
THAT WAS MAMA.

22:42.883 --> 22:45.407
SHE'S AT ANTHONY'S
CAMPAIGN OFFICE.

22:45.407 --> 22:47.017
TURNS OUT DELTA'S
BEHIND THOSE ADS.

22:47.017 --> 22:48.410
WHAT?
YEAH.

22:48.410 --> 22:50.107
ANTHONY WAS JUST
FOLLOWING ORDERS.

22:50.107 --> 22:52.022
THIS ISN'T ABOUT
BABA'S CAMPAIGN.

22:52.022 --> 22:54.155
DELTA'S TARGETING ME.

22:54.155 --> 22:56.505
WHY? DO THEY
KNOW YOU'VE BEEN
WORKING AGAINST THEM?

22:56.505 --> 22:57.898
MAYBE.

22:57.898 --> 22:59.682
MAYBE NOW IS NOT
THE RIGHT TIME

22:59.682 --> 23:01.249
FOR NICKY TO STAGE A BREAK-IN
TO DELTA'S HEADQUARTERS.

23:01.249 --> 23:02.816
YOU'RE ALREADY
ON THEIR RADAR.

23:02.816 --> 23:04.905
AFTER WHAT
THEY DID TO DAMIAN,

23:04.905 --> 23:07.473
IMAGINE WHAT THEY'D
DO TO YOU, ESPECIALLY
AFTER THAT AD.

23:07.473 --> 23:09.431
YOU'RE UNDER
A MICROSCOPE.

23:09.431 --> 23:12.826
NO. LOOK, I'VE BEEN PRETTY
MIXED UP ABOUT EVERYTHING,

23:12.826 --> 23:14.828
BUT I KNOW
I DID RIGHT BY DAMIAN.

23:14.828 --> 23:17.221
I CAN'T LET THEM
DO THIS TO HIM.

23:17.221 --> 23:20.399
DELTA'S BEEN WORKING
IN THE SHADOWS FOR MONTHS,
TRANSFORMING OUR CITY,

23:20.399 --> 23:22.401
AND WE DON'T
EVEN KNOW THE HALF
OF WHAT THEY'RE UP TO.

23:22.401 --> 23:24.577
I'VE GOTTA TAKE
THIS CHANCE.

23:24.577 --> 23:28.102
DELTA THINKS I'M A THREAT?
LET'S PROVE 'EM RIGHT.

23:42.116 --> 23:44.292
PICKUP ISN'T USUALLY
FOR ANOTHER 15 MINUTES.

23:44.292 --> 23:47.164
YOU'RE EARLY.
WHERE ARE...?

23:47.164 --> 23:49.210
ROB AND OMAR?

23:49.210 --> 23:52.300
THEY ATE SOME BAD PASTRAMI.
WE GOT CALLED TO SUB IN.

23:52.300 --> 23:54.433
GUESS WE'RE JUST
A LITTLE MORE EFFICIENT.

24:00.003 --> 24:01.483
WHAT?

24:01.483 --> 24:04.007
YOU'RE JUST...
SUCH A NATURAL.

24:04.007 --> 24:06.706
I MEAN, YEAH,
THIS WAS MY DREAM JOB.

24:06.706 --> 24:09.317
AFTER FIREFIGHTER,
BEFORE ASTRONAUT.

24:09.317 --> 24:11.145
UH-HUH.
I WAS BORN TO WEAR THIS.

24:35.822 --> 24:38.694
I'LL BE ON LOOKOUT.
YOU GOT 15 MINUTES.

24:38.694 --> 24:43.656
HEY. GLAD YOU
GOT YOUR FIRE BACK.
BE CAREFUL.

24:53.492 --> 24:55.494
NICKY.
WHAT ARE WE SEEING?

24:55.494 --> 24:59.062
NOTHING YET.
JUST A WHOLE LOT
OF SECURITY.

25:02.762 --> 25:04.241
I'M TRYING TO GET
TO THE MAINFRAME,

25:04.241 --> 25:06.069
BUT THIS PLACE
IS CRAWLING.

25:53.073 --> 25:54.465
OK. I'M IN.

26:00.733 --> 26:02.430
I NEED TO BYPASS THE LOGIN.

26:02.430 --> 26:05.476
RUN AN SQL WITH
A NEW INJECTION QUERY,

26:05.476 --> 26:07.391
LIKE I TAUGHT YOU,
SUBBING 1 FOR 1

26:07.391 --> 26:09.002
FOR THE USER INPUT.

26:10.307 --> 26:11.874
OK. IT WORKED.

26:13.223 --> 26:15.443
...DAMIAN.

26:18.664 --> 26:20.056
OK. I FOUND DAMIAN.

26:22.798 --> 26:25.671
OK. DELTA'S HOLDING HIM AT
THEIR PROPERTY IN BAYVIEW.

26:29.413 --> 26:31.024
DAMIAN WAS RIGHT.

26:31.024 --> 26:32.939
DELTA'S BEEN WATCHING
HIM FOR WEEKS.

26:32.939 --> 26:34.505
OK, THEY MUST HAVE SHARED
THE SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE

26:34.505 --> 26:36.551
WITH SFPD,
PUTTING HIM ON THEIR RADAR.

26:36.551 --> 26:38.335
SO, THEY
WERE FRAMING HIM.

26:38.335 --> 26:39.902
YEAH, IT LOOKS LIKE,
BUT THOSE CAMERAS
ARE LEGAL.

26:39.902 --> 26:41.687
THIS STILL
ISN'T PROOF.

26:41.687 --> 26:44.690
OK, THESE CLIPS
ARE WHAT DELTA
WANTED THE COPS TO SEE,

26:44.690 --> 26:46.387
SHOWING DAMIAN AT
THE SCENE OF THE CRIME.

26:46.387 --> 26:47.910
BUT WHAT IF THERE'S MORE?

26:47.910 --> 26:50.130
OK, ALTHEA,
HOW DID YOU RECOVER

26:50.130 --> 26:51.958
THOSE PAYROLL FILES
THAT BABA
ACCIDENTALLY DELETED?

26:51.958 --> 26:53.655
YOU'RE GONNA WANNA
PULL UP THE NETWORK'S

26:53.655 --> 26:55.265
ROOT NAVIGATION INDEX.

26:55.265 --> 26:57.006
ONCE YOU DO THAT,
FILTER THROUGH THE ENTRIES

26:57.006 --> 27:00.401
USING THE WORD "DELETE,"
RESTORING THE BACKUP.

27:00.401 --> 27:04.274
OK. THERE'S A VIDEO
OF DAMIAN PLAYING
BASKETBALL ALONE

27:04.274 --> 27:05.972
AT 6:31 P.M.

27:05.972 --> 27:07.364
THAT'S THE TIME
OF THE ROBBERY.

27:07.364 --> 27:09.236
DELTA BURIED IT.

27:09.236 --> 27:10.890
THIS VIDEO,
IT'LL EXONERATE HIM?

27:10.890 --> 27:14.067
YUP. SENDING YOU
THE FILE NOW.

27:14.067 --> 27:16.025
ALL RIGHT. GOT IT.
SENDING TO NADIA.

27:16.025 --> 27:18.462
NICKY, WE HAVE WHAT
WE NEED TO FREE DAMIAN.

27:18.462 --> 27:21.770
THAT'S ALL WE HAVE.
WE NEED MORE.

27:21.770 --> 27:24.817
I'M GONNA SEARCH
THAT CODE DAMIAN
WAS TAGGED WITH.

27:24.817 --> 27:26.645
I GOT SOMETHING.

27:27.863 --> 27:31.475
THIS IS
WAY BIGGER THAN DAMIAN.

27:31.475 --> 27:32.955
OK, HE WAS JUST THE BEGINNING.

27:32.955 --> 27:34.391
WHAT ARE YOU SEEING?

27:34.391 --> 27:36.393
A LIST, A HUGE LIST.

27:36.393 --> 27:38.744
THEY'RE TARGETING
HUNDREDS OF SF RESIDENTS,

27:38.744 --> 27:41.268
AMASSING
TONS OF DATA ON THEM.

27:41.268 --> 27:43.096
THEY'RE ALL CANDIDATES
FOR LOCKUP.

27:45.794 --> 27:48.492
SEB'S NAME IS ON THIS LIST.

27:48.492 --> 27:50.103
I GOTTA GET YOU THESE FILES.

27:50.103 --> 27:52.366
NO, THAT TRANSFER IS HUGE.
IT'LL TAKE TOO LONG.

27:52.366 --> 27:54.063
NICKY, YOU'RE GONNA
GET YOURSELF CAUGHT.

27:54.063 --> 27:56.065
NO. I--I DON'T CARE.

27:56.065 --> 27:57.806
WE HAVE TO COMB THROUGH
ALL OF THIS

27:57.806 --> 27:59.808
AND FIND SOMETHING WE CAN USE
TO TAKE THEM DOWN.

27:59.808 --> 28:02.028
OK? WHAT DO I DO?

28:10.601 --> 28:13.474
HEY! I GOT A TRUCK
AT THE GATE.

28:13.474 --> 28:15.084
ROB AND OMAR?

28:15.084 --> 28:18.522
HUH. MUST BE
SOME KIND OF A MIX-UP.

28:18.522 --> 28:21.308
YEAH.
WHERE'S YOUR PARTNER?

28:47.769 --> 28:49.771
WE'VE BEEN MADE.
GET OUT. NOW.

28:49.771 --> 28:52.774
NO. I'M FINISHING THIS.
HENRY, YOU GET TO SAFETY.

28:54.080 --> 28:55.734
COME ON.

29:03.437 --> 29:04.960
UH!

29:04.960 --> 29:06.396
NICKY?

29:09.573 --> 29:11.750
NICKY, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

29:11.750 --> 29:13.708
UH, ALTHEA?

29:13.708 --> 29:15.754
WHOA. HEY,
WHAT HAPPENED?

29:26.982 --> 29:28.679
UH! UHH!

29:39.690 --> 29:41.605

NICKY SHEN.

30:36.791 --> 30:40.099
WOW. LUCKY ME.

30:40.099 --> 30:42.231
FACE TIME WITH THE CEO.

30:42.231 --> 30:44.930
"THE ARCHITECT."

30:44.930 --> 30:46.975
GUESS I SHOULDN'T
BE SURPRISED.

30:46.975 --> 30:49.238
YOU LAUNCHED A WHOLE
PR CAMPAIGN AGAINST ME.

30:49.238 --> 30:51.675
WE HAVE TAKEN NOTICE.

30:51.675 --> 30:54.678
WHY? WHY COME AFTER ME?

30:54.678 --> 30:59.335
SAN FRANCISCO IS
THE KEY TO OUR SUCCESS.

30:59.335 --> 31:02.512
NOW, THE CITY COMES WITH
ITS OWN CHALLENGES--

31:02.512 --> 31:05.733
HIGH RENTS, A NOMINALLY
LIBERAL ELECTORATE.

31:07.866 --> 31:10.259
BUT WITH TIME...

31:10.259 --> 31:12.522
ALL THESE DIFFICULTIES

31:12.522 --> 31:14.394
WOULD JUST BECOME
PART OF OUR PITCH,

31:14.394 --> 31:17.963
PROOF TO THE WORLD
IF WE CAN TAME
THIS CITY,

31:17.963 --> 31:20.139
WE CAN TAME ANY CITY.

31:21.401 --> 31:25.405
THE ONE QUIRK THAT
WE DIDN'T PLAN ON
IS YOU.

31:27.886 --> 31:29.888
SAN FRANCISCO HAS A HERO.

31:31.367 --> 31:33.152
HOW CAN WE BE THE SAVIOR

31:33.152 --> 31:34.805
IF THE CITY
ALREADY HAS ONE?

31:34.805 --> 31:36.720
MOST OF THE CITY DOESN'T
EVEN KNOW WHO I AM.

31:36.720 --> 31:40.159
WELL...THEY DO NOW.

31:41.769 --> 31:43.684
I THINK THIS IS
ABOUT NUMBERS.

31:45.381 --> 31:46.992
TO SELL YOURSELF
TO THE CITY,

31:46.992 --> 31:50.212
YOU NEED STATS
ON YOUR SIDE--
HIGH CRIME NUMBERS.

31:50.212 --> 31:53.346
TO PROFIT OFF OF CRIME,
YOU NEED BODIES, ARRESTS.

31:53.346 --> 31:55.478
I GET TO CRIME
BEFORE THE COPS DO,

31:55.478 --> 31:57.611
THAT MEANS FEWER BODIES
IN JAIL,

31:57.611 --> 32:00.744
FEWER PEOPLE IN
YOUR REHAB PROGRAM.

32:01.963 --> 32:04.139
I AM BAD FOR YOUR NUMBERS.

32:05.924 --> 32:07.577
WHAT?

32:07.577 --> 32:11.233
OH, NOTHING.
I JUST...

32:11.233 --> 32:13.105
FEEL A LOT BETTER
ABOUT MYSELF.

32:13.105 --> 32:15.498
HMM.

32:15.498 --> 32:17.065
I KNOW YOU FRAMED DAMIAN.

32:17.065 --> 32:18.849
I GOT IT OUT--

32:18.849 --> 32:21.026
THE EVIDENCE YOU BURIED.

32:21.026 --> 32:22.853
DAMIAN CAN BE REPLACED.

32:22.853 --> 32:24.812
YOUR OTHER CANDIDATES,

32:24.812 --> 32:26.770
YOU GONNA FRAME THEM, TOO?

32:26.770 --> 32:30.470
I'M SORRY.
NICKY, YOU'VE GOT IT
ALL WRONG.

32:30.470 --> 32:33.473
DAMIAN WAS
A SPECIAL CASE.

32:33.473 --> 32:37.433
HE WAS A PERFECT MODEL
FOR A CANDIDATE--

32:37.433 --> 32:39.653
YOUNG, LIKABLE,

32:39.653 --> 32:43.222
A CRIMINAL RECORD
BUT NOTHING TOO UNSAVORY.

32:43.222 --> 32:47.008
AS FOR THE OTHERS,
WELL, LET'S JUST SAY

32:47.008 --> 32:49.141
THEY DON'T REQUIRE
SUCH EFFORTS...

32:50.969 --> 32:53.145
THANKS TO THE ALGORITHM.

32:53.145 --> 32:55.234
THE ALGORITHM?

32:55.234 --> 32:57.627
OUR PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY.

33:00.369 --> 33:02.197
RIGHT HERE
IN THIS BUILDING,

33:02.197 --> 33:05.505
WE ARE CREATING
THE FUTURE OF SECURITY,

33:05.505 --> 33:08.421
THE NEXT STEP IN
PREDICTIVE POLICING.

33:08.421 --> 33:10.640
GIVEN SUFFICIENT DATA,
OUR ALGORITHM
CAN PREDICT

33:10.640 --> 33:12.425
WHO WILL COMMIT
A CRIME IN THE FUTURE.

33:12.425 --> 33:13.948
YOU SAY YOU
GET TO CRIME
WHEN IT HAPPENS.

33:13.948 --> 33:15.341
KUDOS. GOOD FOR YOU.

33:15.341 --> 33:18.779
BUT US? WE GET THERE
BEFORE IT HAPPENS.

33:18.779 --> 33:20.346
THAT'S YOUR PLAN?

33:20.346 --> 33:23.001
ARREST PEOPLE BEFORE
THEY'VE COMMITTED A CRIME?

33:23.001 --> 33:24.219
YES.

33:46.067 --> 33:48.461
PREEMPTIVE ARREST.

33:48.461 --> 33:51.420
THAT'S UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
IT'S ILLEGAL.

33:51.420 --> 33:53.944
OHH, IT IS NOW.

33:53.944 --> 33:57.078
TRUE INNOVATORS
ANTICIPATE THE FUTURE.

33:57.078 --> 33:59.602
OUR ALGORITHM ISN'T
MADE FOR TODAY'S WORLD

33:59.602 --> 34:03.345
WITH ITS ANTIQUATED LAWS
AND "CIVIL LIBERTIES"...

34:04.955 --> 34:08.220
INEFFICIENCIES THAT
STAND IN THE WAY

34:08.220 --> 34:11.527
OF REAL SOLUTIONS
AND REAL SECURITY.

34:11.527 --> 34:13.834
I KNOW THIS CITY.

34:13.834 --> 34:15.662
THE PEOPLE HERE
WON'T LET YOU DO THIS.

34:15.662 --> 34:17.490
THEY ALREADY HAVE.

34:17.490 --> 34:20.667
THEIR REPRESENTATIVES
PASSED ORDINANCE 11.

34:20.667 --> 34:22.234
AFTER YOU BLACKMAILED THEM.

34:22.234 --> 34:24.323
PUBLIC SUPPORT
FOR ORDINANCE 11

34:24.323 --> 34:26.977
STANDS AT 59%.

34:26.977 --> 34:28.762
IT'S BEEN IN EFFECT
FOR DAYS.

34:28.762 --> 34:32.331
I DON'T SEE ANY
PROTESTS. DO YOU?

34:32.331 --> 34:33.941
THEN I'LL STOP YOU.

34:33.941 --> 34:36.857
FROM WHERE? PRISON?

34:36.857 --> 34:38.815
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

34:41.383 --> 34:44.430
I HAVE YOU ON VIDEO
BREAKING IN...

34:44.430 --> 34:47.302
ILLEGALLY ACCESSING
PRIVATE COMPANY MATERIALS,

34:47.302 --> 34:49.348
AND ASSAULTING MEMBERS
OF MY SECURITY TEAM.

34:51.263 --> 34:53.656
THE POLICE WILL BE HERE
IN A FEW MINUTES.

35:04.014 --> 35:06.713
YOU KNOW,
I ADMIRE YOU, NICKY.

35:06.713 --> 35:08.541
WE'RE NOT THAT DIFFERENT.

35:08.541 --> 35:10.369
WE BOTH WANT
THE SAME THING--

35:10.369 --> 35:14.112
PEACE, SECURITY,
AND A CRIME-FREE CITY.

35:14.112 --> 35:16.505
I AM NOTHING LIKE YOU.

35:33.392 --> 35:35.437
HENRY?
HI.

35:36.656 --> 35:38.223
THE COPS ARE COMING.
OH, I HEARD.

35:38.223 --> 35:40.181
THAT'S WHY
WE BETTER MOVE.

35:40.181 --> 35:43.053
UHH. COME ON.
I--I CAN'T.

35:43.053 --> 35:44.968
WHAT?
THIS ISN'T DELTA.

35:44.968 --> 35:47.319
THIS IS THE POLICE.
THEY HAVE MY NAME,
MY FACE.

35:47.319 --> 35:49.973
I BROKE THE LAW
TO GET IN HERE,
AND THEY HAVE PROOF.

35:49.973 --> 35:51.453
WE'LL WORRY ABOUT THAT
WHEN WE GET OUT. LET'S GO.

35:51.453 --> 35:53.412
NO. I DON'T WANT
TO BE A FUGITIVE.

35:53.412 --> 35:54.891
I HAVE TO FACE
THE CONSEQUENCES.

35:54.891 --> 35:56.066
I CANNOT JUST
LEAVE YOU HERE.

35:56.066 --> 35:58.156
HENRY, GO.

35:58.156 --> 36:00.114
I NEED YOU OUT THERE.
XIAO IS STILL IN THE WIND.

36:00.114 --> 36:02.421
IF DELTA ISN'T
STOPPED, THEY WILL
DESTROY THIS CITY.

36:02.421 --> 36:04.901
I NEED YOU
TO HELP MY FAMILY.

36:04.901 --> 36:08.035
LEAD THEM. YOU'RE
THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN.

36:26.445 --> 36:29.796

36:30.971 --> 36:33.321

36:58.955 --> 37:01.480
ALL RIGHT. NADIA GOT
THE SURVEILLANCE VIDEO

37:01.480 --> 37:03.177
TO D.A. URSILLO
FOR REVIEW.

37:03.177 --> 37:05.005
SHE THINKS DAMIAN'S SENTENCE
WILL BE VACATED

37:05.005 --> 37:07.181
IN THE NEXT 48 HOURS.

37:07.181 --> 37:09.966
THAT'S GREAT. BUT...

37:09.966 --> 37:12.317
NICKY'S STILL
BEING PROCESSED.

37:12.317 --> 37:14.144
WE SHOULD KNOW
MORE TOMORROW.

37:22.109 --> 37:24.067
NICKY WILL BE OK.

37:26.331 --> 37:28.333
SHE WILL.

37:28.333 --> 37:31.249
WE'RE GONNA DO EVERYTHING
WE CAN TO GET HER OUT.

37:31.249 --> 37:34.121
IN THE MEANTIME,
WE CAN'T GIVE UP.

37:34.121 --> 37:36.079
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

37:36.079 --> 37:38.908
XIAO'S STILL OUT THERE.
PEI-LING NEEDS US.

37:38.908 --> 37:40.475
NICKY WAS DELTA'S
BIGGEST OBSTACLE,

37:40.475 --> 37:42.216
AND THEY JUST TOOK HER
OFF THE BOARD.

37:42.216 --> 37:45.132
RIGHT NOW,
WE'RE ALL THAT'S LEFT.

37:45.132 --> 37:47.221
WE'RE GONNA KEEP FIGHTING

37:47.221 --> 37:49.092
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE DO.

37:57.884 --> 37:59.799
YOU'RE BACK.

37:59.799 --> 38:01.627
I GOT YOUR TEXT.

38:01.627 --> 38:04.151
STILL HAD MY KEY.

38:05.370 --> 38:07.372
HEY. WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?

38:10.070 --> 38:14.335
HEY. I'M GLAD
YOU REACHED OUT.

38:14.335 --> 38:16.990
I KNOW I SAID
I NEEDED SPACE AND I...

38:16.990 --> 38:18.557
SEB, YOU DON'T HAVE TO--

38:18.557 --> 38:20.428
I DO.

38:20.428 --> 38:22.691
THE WAY I LEFT.

38:24.693 --> 38:26.347
I'M SORRY.

38:28.262 --> 38:31.004
WHAT HAPPENED
WITH XIAO

38:31.004 --> 38:34.007
SCARED THE HELL
OUT OF ME,

38:34.007 --> 38:37.489
AND IT MADE ME REALIZE
THAT I NEVER...

38:37.489 --> 38:40.448
REALLY FACED WHAT I DID.

38:42.102 --> 38:46.280
SO I FINALLY DID IT...

38:47.847 --> 38:50.937
SOMETHING I SHOULD'VE DONE
A LONG TIME AGO.

38:50.937 --> 38:53.243
UH, WHAT?

38:54.636 --> 38:56.769
I TALKED TO THEM...

38:56.769 --> 38:59.859
THE FAMILY OF THE MAN
I KILLED.

39:02.383 --> 39:07.432
I CALLED THEM.
WE HAD A SIT-DOWN.

39:07.432 --> 39:10.696
I LOOKED THEM RIGHT
IN THEIR EYES, AND...

39:13.438 --> 39:15.048
I APOLOGIZED.

39:15.048 --> 39:17.572
WELL, HOW'D
THEY REACT?

39:17.572 --> 39:20.183
THEY HEARD ME OUT,

39:20.183 --> 39:22.664
THEN THEY SHOWED ME
THE DOOR.

39:24.579 --> 39:26.973
IT'S THEIR RIGHT.

39:26.973 --> 39:30.411
THEY DON'T
OWE ME FORGIVENESS.

39:30.411 --> 39:34.502
STILL, I'M GLAD
I DID IT.

39:36.156 --> 39:39.768
BUT I'M HOPING
THIS CONVERSATION

39:39.768 --> 39:42.075
GOES DIFFERENTLY.

39:43.511 --> 39:45.295
IF YOU'LL HAVE ME--
YOU NEED TO GO.

39:46.471 --> 39:49.125
I WANT YOU BACK.

39:49.125 --> 39:51.476
I WANT YOU TO STAY,

39:51.476 --> 39:53.956
BUT THAT CONSPIRACY
WE'VE BEEN
DIGGING INTO--

39:53.956 --> 39:55.828
DELTA'S MAKING
BIG MOVES.

39:55.828 --> 39:58.831
THEY'RE LOCKING
PEOPLE UP.

39:58.831 --> 40:01.660
NICKY SAW YOUR NAME
ON THEIR LIST.
YOU'RE A TARGET.

40:01.660 --> 40:04.837
AND THEY ALREADY
GOT HER AND IF THEY
GOT YOU, TOO, I--

40:07.492 --> 40:09.711
YOU NEED TO LEAVE
THE CITY.
YOU NEED TO GO.

40:09.711 --> 40:11.321
YOU GOTTA GO.

40:12.801 --> 40:14.629
THERE'S SOME BAD STUFF
GOING DOWN

40:14.629 --> 40:17.458
AND YOU AND YOUR FAMILY
ARE FIGHTING IT?

40:17.458 --> 40:19.112
THEN I'M FIGHTING IT
WITH YOU,

40:19.112 --> 40:22.332
EVEN WITH A TARGET
ON MY BACK.

40:24.422 --> 40:28.948
SORRY, BUB.
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.089
PEBBLES,
WHERE IS EVERYONE?

40:41.395 --> 40:43.832
WELL, UH, MAMA AND BABA
ARE UPSTAIRS,

40:43.832 --> 40:45.921
AND NICKY'S IN JAIL.

40:45.921 --> 40:48.271
WAIT. WHAT?

40:48.271 --> 40:49.838
UM...

40:49.838 --> 40:51.492
YOU KNOW HOW WE DECIDED
TO RETURN THOSE GIFTS

40:51.492 --> 40:54.408
AND TELL YOUR PARENTS
WE DO NOT NEED THEIR MONEY?

40:54.408 --> 40:55.627
YEAH...

40:55.627 --> 40:57.498
WELL, UM...

40:57.498 --> 40:59.152
NICKY'S GETTING
ARRAIGNED TOMORROW,

40:59.152 --> 41:02.503
AND WE CAN'T AFFORD
HER BAIL, SO...

41:02.503 --> 41:04.462
WE NEED
YOUR PARENTS' MONEY.

41:06.681 --> 41:09.118
YEAH.
