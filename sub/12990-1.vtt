00:00.800 --> 00:03.200
Cleaver Greene. How do you do?

00:04.160 --> 00:06.190
You're so dirty.

00:06.240 --> 00:08.230
And filthy, you know?

00:08.280 --> 00:10.190
I'm happy when I'm with you.

00:10.240 --> 00:12.430
Guess that's why I got the big bucks.

00:12.480 --> 00:15.150
No, just explaining to your wife here
that she's secretly in love with me.

00:15.200 --> 00:17.390
- Is that a ring?
- Congratulations.

00:17.440 --> 00:19.870
- When did this happen?
- Who's the poor bastard?

00:19.920 --> 00:21.750
- Bevan.
- This is Melissa.

00:21.800 --> 00:23.070
Hi.

00:23.120 --> 00:25.190
So, have you met Cleaver Green before?

00:25.240 --> 00:28.150
David is a warm-hearted man who loves me,

00:28.200 --> 00:33.310
but I don't know why... when things
turned to shit, I came to you.

00:33.360 --> 00:37.430
♪ Baba-daba-da... ♪

00:37.480 --> 00:38.990
He's a beautiful student.

00:39.040 --> 00:41.590
She is your teacher! It
is age-inappropriate sex!

00:41.640 --> 00:42.750
It's bloody great sex.

00:42.800 --> 00:44.190
Who did you screw?

00:44.240 --> 00:47.680
Let's have nothing more
to do with each other. OK?

00:48.720 --> 00:51.830
I used to be a prostitute, Scarlet.

00:51.880 --> 00:53.230
This is Missy?

00:53.280 --> 00:55.830
- Small world, huh?
- Because... gosh, it paid well.

00:55.880 --> 00:58.230
Oh, my God, Cleaver Greene!

00:58.280 --> 01:02.070
- That's how you know him, isn't it?
- David and I have split.

01:02.120 --> 01:03.390
Come here, you bloody fool.

01:03.440 --> 01:07.030
I love you all, most of all you.

01:07.080 --> 01:12.030
This whole relationship has just
been one long series of sorrys!

01:13.120 --> 01:14.550
At least we had a few good years.

01:14.600 --> 01:16.470
How's Barney?

01:16.520 --> 01:18.510
Things are not great at the moment.

01:18.560 --> 01:20.390
That's the one.

01:23.800 --> 01:26.800
It was a one-off. It
won't come to anything.

01:27.840 --> 01:29.630
It's been pretty full-on. We're in love.

01:29.680 --> 01:32.150
It's Sally from across the road.

01:34.360 --> 01:36.200
Yeah, I like him.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.670
My best mate's happiness
is hanging by a thread!

01:40.720 --> 01:42.030
Nicole!

01:42.080 --> 01:44.990
I bloody told you not to interfere!

01:45.040 --> 01:47.190
David Potter and I did not have sex.

01:47.240 --> 01:49.270
Oh, I'm sure you didn't.
That's just politics, Engles.

01:49.320 --> 01:50.430
Come on, darling.

01:50.480 --> 01:51.830
You know me.

01:51.880 --> 01:55.270
My feelings never get displaced,
they just get added to.

01:55.320 --> 01:57.310
- Oh!
- Oh...

01:57.360 --> 01:58.830
- Listen...
- I've left Bevan.

01:58.880 --> 02:00.070
What?!

02:00.120 --> 02:01.990
She's pregnant and the baby's mine.

02:02.040 --> 02:03.190
Barney has cancer.

02:03.240 --> 02:05.030
It is the greatest thing
that has ever happened to me.

02:05.080 --> 02:08.240
So he's lost a ball and
he's fathered a baby.

02:11.720 --> 02:13.390
David, it's over.

02:13.440 --> 02:14.950
We're getting married, mate.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.230
Ah!

02:16.280 --> 02:17.910
She was my wife first!

02:17.960 --> 02:19.830
So let's do this.

02:19.880 --> 02:24.230
I had sex last night. She was riding me...

02:24.280 --> 02:26.620
You're in a confessional box.

02:27.200 --> 02:29.070
Hi, Dad. This is Patience.

02:29.120 --> 02:31.310
- Patience, how do you do?
- We're in love.

02:31.360 --> 02:33.070
Wendy and Roger...

02:33.120 --> 02:34.670
Roger's a drug dealer.

02:34.720 --> 02:35.790
- What?!
- Right!

02:35.840 --> 02:37.190
Oh!

02:37.240 --> 02:41.440
- I'm Wendy. I'm his ex.
- Felicity. Right. Wendy. Of course.

02:42.880 --> 02:44.350
- It's back.
- What's back?

02:44.400 --> 02:45.430
The cancer.

02:45.480 --> 02:47.590
I really appreciate this, mate.

02:47.640 --> 02:50.350
I'm trying to undo the bloody thing.

02:50.400 --> 02:52.740
Ah! Oh, for the love of God!

03:31.080 --> 03:33.670
See, my parents grew up
in an age of certainty.

03:33.720 --> 03:37.750
Christmas holidays in the same place
every year, same friends, same jobs.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.310
There was a kind of confidence

03:39.360 --> 03:42.590
in the... in the everyday,
in the quotidian.

03:42.640 --> 03:43.670
I did...

03:43.720 --> 03:45.510
Karly, you haven't touched your kale.

03:45.560 --> 03:48.510
Look, you know, they knew who
they were, where they belonged,

03:48.560 --> 03:49.910
what the future held.

03:49.960 --> 03:53.070
- You can't escape kale these days.
- I know.

03:53.120 --> 03:54.190
One minute it doesn't exist,

03:54.240 --> 03:57.310
the next minute it's taken
over every meal on the planet.

03:57.360 --> 03:59.310
Stock market surges and plunges.

03:59.360 --> 04:01.550
Islamic terrorists blowing themselves up.

04:01.600 --> 04:04.150
Something bad is in the air
out that window, I tell you.

04:04.200 --> 04:05.590
Well, that's just bullshit.

04:05.640 --> 04:08.150
The world is exactly the
same as it always has been.

04:08.200 --> 04:10.190
The last century was the
bloodiest in history.

04:10.240 --> 04:11.470
Disagree, Paul.

04:11.520 --> 04:13.670
More than 200 million
people died in wars alone.

04:13.720 --> 04:17.630
You ask ordinary people out there
-- friends, people at my office --

04:17.680 --> 04:19.550
no-one feels safe anymore.

04:19.600 --> 04:20.670
Well, of course they don't.

04:20.720 --> 04:23.150
It's not in the media's interest
to make anyone feel safe.

04:23.200 --> 04:24.670
Here he goes again.

04:24.720 --> 04:27.150
Advertising is sold on
the back of our paranoia.

04:27.200 --> 04:29.830
I mean, the odds of something
exceptionally bad happening to you

04:29.880 --> 04:31.230
are about 20,000 to 1.

04:31.280 --> 04:33.070
You know what Carl Jung said --

04:33.120 --> 04:37.030
by the year 2000, we would all be
in such a state of psychic turmoil

04:37.080 --> 04:39.230
that we would no longer be
able to predict outcomes.

04:39.280 --> 04:40.550
Yea, well, Jung was Swiss.

04:40.600 --> 04:44.600
His idea of turmoil was a train
running five seconds late.

04:44.880 --> 04:48.870
We're just a little bit indulgent
to be suffering all this angst

04:48.920 --> 04:51.990
while we're sitting in this
beautiful house with a glorious view

04:52.040 --> 04:55.670
eating perfectly cooked scampi
and quaffing Provencal rose.

04:55.720 --> 04:58.670
The world is a scarier place now, Paul.

04:58.720 --> 05:00.550
Well, then stop watching 24-hour news,

05:00.600 --> 05:04.310
stop listening to moron shock
jocks, reading celebrity tweets,

05:04.360 --> 05:06.950
and you'll find that this whole
globe just keeps on turning.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.300
And our little lives
remain as predictable as...

05:14.960 --> 05:17.350
- Ah! Oh! Oh, my God!
- Shit! Cleaver!

05:17.400 --> 05:20.270
Oh, my GOD! Oh, my God!

05:20.320 --> 05:23.790
Grab the rope! Grab the fucking...

05:23.840 --> 05:25.440
Cut the rope!

05:27.440 --> 05:28.980
Oh, my God!

05:29.800 --> 05:32.080
- Cut the rope!
- Oh!

05:36.240 --> 05:39.160
Don't leave me up here! Cleaver!

05:48.800 --> 05:50.360
Ed?

05:52.160 --> 05:54.040
Ed Thompson?

05:58.880 --> 06:01.720
SHIT!

06:09.240 --> 06:12.430
OK. Morphine's kicking in. How's
the neck? Check his tongue.

06:12.480 --> 06:15.080
Pressure's stable. Stats are good.

06:15.840 --> 06:18.150
My dreams of your image

06:18.200 --> 06:19.910
That blossoms arose

06:19.960 --> 06:22.100
In the deeps of my heart.

06:23.360 --> 06:25.430
Tell me, have you
evacuated your bowels yet?

06:25.480 --> 06:27.630
In a million-to-one accident,

06:27.680 --> 06:29.870
a runaway balloon minus its pilot

06:29.920 --> 06:31.910
soared high above Sydney Harbour,

06:31.960 --> 06:35.350
one man dangling precariously
from a rope beneath

06:35.400 --> 06:37.630
and another man trapped
in the basket above.

06:37.680 --> 06:41.030
Crashed through the window, and
he grabbed at the table, and...

06:41.080 --> 06:42.470
If it hadn't been for Paul here

06:42.520 --> 06:45.460
grabbing the knife and cutting the rope...

06:46.640 --> 06:47.830
Where's Paul?

06:47.880 --> 06:49.390
Paul was the hero.

06:49.440 --> 06:51.190
Paul was... He cut the rope.

06:51.240 --> 06:54.640
Otherwise, that poor man
would still be up there.

06:59.080 --> 07:02.790
OK. What is so significant, I need to
be dragged from a performance review?

07:02.840 --> 07:04.910
This is Caitlin Farquhar.
She's a journalist with...

07:04.960 --> 07:07.390
Yes. I don't care. Why is she here?

07:07.440 --> 07:08.790
This.

07:08.840 --> 07:11.590
.. minus its pilot soared
high about Sydney Harbour,

07:11.640 --> 07:14.070
one man dangling precariously from a...

07:14.120 --> 07:16.150
Yeah, I know all about it. I mean,
why is this of interest to me?

07:16.200 --> 07:18.630
The man in the background,
at the right of frame.

07:18.680 --> 07:20.030
It's a fuckin' balloon accident.

07:20.080 --> 07:22.830
I'm Assistant Commissioner of Police.
I don't deal with fuckin' balloons.

07:22.880 --> 07:25.590
This is the man who cut the rope
of the guy hanging from the balloon.

07:25.640 --> 07:27.430
- Tick-tock.
- No, no. Look. Keep looking.

07:27.480 --> 07:30.230
See, he keeps his head down,
puts up a hand to his face.

07:30.280 --> 07:32.790
I wanted to interview him,
but he disappeared on me.

07:32.840 --> 07:34.510
See how he's shuffling
away at the edge of frame?

07:34.560 --> 07:37.430
So he hates publicity. I mean,
really? You called me down for this?

07:37.480 --> 07:39.840
No, I called you down...

07:40.880 --> 07:42.420
.. for this.

07:43.520 --> 07:45.990
Taken from the surveillance
camera in the next street.

07:46.040 --> 07:48.980
He makes the fatal mistake of looking up.

07:52.520 --> 07:54.430
It's Edgar Thompson.

07:54.480 --> 07:57.280
Country's most wanted '97 through '99.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.400
He's aged a bit, but it's him.

08:02.480 --> 08:03.950
Thompson escaped 19 years ago.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.790
I mean, he's either dead

08:05.840 --> 08:08.510
or living somewhere in the south of
France or the jungles of Nicaragua.

08:08.560 --> 08:09.990
Yeah, that's the conventional wisdom,

08:10.040 --> 08:11.230
but I checked, and his mother...

08:11.280 --> 08:13.070
Apparently he was very
close to his mother.

08:13.120 --> 08:15.510
.. is dying, and we reckon he's
come out of hiding to see her.

08:15.560 --> 08:17.190
I checked with Customs.

08:17.240 --> 08:21.430
Seems that this man...
Payolo, Pallo... sio...

08:21.480 --> 08:23.990
Paolo Palacios Quintanilla
entered the country

08:24.040 --> 08:25.310
on a Guatemalan passport.

08:25.360 --> 08:26.760
Got him.

08:27.800 --> 08:29.750
- Maybe.
- It's him, Ruth!

08:29.800 --> 08:30.990
Come on.

08:31.040 --> 08:34.510
No-one's wanted to track this
bastard down more than you.

08:34.559 --> 08:38.159
Yeah, it's been 19 very
long years, I'll admit that.

08:38.919 --> 08:40.360
OK.

08:41.679 --> 08:43.190
But tread carefully, Waz.

08:43.240 --> 08:46.070
You know, the last thing we need is
another mistaken identity fuck-up.

08:46.120 --> 08:48.590
That'd be the third this month.

08:48.960 --> 08:50.430
So no tasers.

08:50.480 --> 08:52.880
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

08:58.800 --> 09:01.670
Uh... Good job.

09:01.720 --> 09:04.350
The identity of the man
still in the balloon

09:04.400 --> 09:05.630
is at this point unknown,

09:05.680 --> 09:09.430
but police and safety officers
hold grave fears for his life.

09:09.480 --> 09:12.550
Both the Australian and New
Zealand navies, meanwhile,

09:12.600 --> 09:15.700
are trying to track the
balloon's trajectory.

09:22.520 --> 09:25.030
What a strange way to end a life --

09:25.080 --> 09:29.120
in a balloon ascending to a
heaven I never really believed in.

09:31.040 --> 09:34.390
Strange, like most of my life.

09:34.440 --> 09:37.040
I thought my cancer would kill me.

09:37.640 --> 09:40.840
Instead it was Cleaver
and this bloody balloon.

09:43.080 --> 09:45.790
I don't want to be filled with regrets.

09:45.840 --> 09:47.280
But I am.

09:49.400 --> 09:53.000
Mostly I'm sorry that I
didn't love more and better.

09:53.600 --> 09:58.200
I held back giving love from
fear it would swallow me up.

09:59.280 --> 10:02.080
Embrace it with passion and joy.

10:03.160 --> 10:05.270
This is all there is.

10:05.320 --> 10:08.560
To Scarlet, the first
great love of my life...

10:09.720 --> 10:11.520
.. I only hope...

10:12.280 --> 10:13.830
.. that David will treat you well

10:13.880 --> 10:16.680
and you find the happiness you deserve.

10:17.080 --> 10:23.070
Of course now up here in the
heavens, all this seems so trivial.

10:23.120 --> 10:25.390
Up here I can love you all.

10:26.600 --> 10:29.070
I wish we could've made it work.

10:29.680 --> 10:32.990
But especially to my beautiful Nicole...

10:33.040 --> 10:36.190
.. my great and wonderful saviour,

10:36.240 --> 10:38.830
I adore you,

10:38.880 --> 10:40.280
and I...

10:43.040 --> 10:46.800
Shit! Fuckin' battery!

10:55.480 --> 10:56.750
Go on.

10:57.680 --> 10:59.350
Whatever is out there,

10:59.400 --> 11:02.110
be it bloody Rapture,

11:02.160 --> 11:03.900
be it nothing...

11:05.120 --> 11:07.200
.. I am here...

11:09.840 --> 11:11.580
.. incomplete...

11:12.160 --> 11:13.760
.. unready...

11:14.880 --> 11:16.480
.. but yours!

11:34.040 --> 11:35.480
Ah.

11:36.840 --> 11:40.230
Hello. Welcome back to
the land of the living.

11:42.160 --> 11:45.670
How's my little fella doing?

11:45.720 --> 11:47.990
- Ooh, he's a little fella!
- What are you doing?

11:48.040 --> 11:50.880
Daddy's boy. Uh...

11:52.000 --> 11:53.270
Holy shit.

11:53.320 --> 11:54.670
- What?
- What?

11:54.720 --> 11:56.390
What?

11:56.440 --> 11:58.830
You just look a little... older.

11:58.880 --> 12:00.830
Did you sleep OK?

12:00.880 --> 12:02.110
- Yes, thank you.
- Uh...

12:02.160 --> 12:06.070
- This isn't our bedroom, is it? - No.

12:06.120 --> 12:07.950
What's...

12:08.000 --> 12:12.150
Is this the nurse/patient
thing that we discussed?

12:12.200 --> 12:14.230
You discussed. No.

12:14.280 --> 12:15.350
The funniest thing...

12:15.400 --> 12:17.670
- What?
- Ha-ha-ha!

12:17.720 --> 12:19.430
I ran into... I ran into Ed Thompson.

12:19.480 --> 12:21.350
- Oh, did you?
- Yeah.

12:21.400 --> 12:24.340
I thought he was on holidays in Colombia.

12:27.200 --> 12:29.430
He's not on holidays. He's skipping bail.

12:29.480 --> 12:31.630
What... what year do you think it is?

12:31.680 --> 12:33.950
Bail? Hello!

12:34.000 --> 12:37.150
We just got a postcard
from him on the fridge.

12:37.200 --> 12:39.030
- Oh, Cleave.
- Ah?

12:39.080 --> 12:40.990
I think it might be time for
you to have a little nap.

12:41.040 --> 12:44.840
No, no, don't go. Don't go,
don't go. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:45.440 --> 12:46.590
Daddy's boy.

12:46.640 --> 12:48.550
Ooh, Daddy's little baby boy!

12:48.600 --> 12:49.910
Yeah.

12:49.960 --> 12:52.270
I'm still thinking Finnegan.

12:52.320 --> 12:53.870
- Don't you think?
- Yeah?

12:53.920 --> 12:55.670
Proud Irish name.

12:55.720 --> 12:57.430
Fuck, I love you.

12:57.480 --> 13:00.390
I'm sorry about the last couple of years.

13:00.440 --> 13:03.190
I'm gonna be good now. I swear.

13:03.240 --> 13:04.390
No more women?

13:04.440 --> 13:06.990
No more women. No more wine.

13:07.040 --> 13:11.790
Ed and I made a pact --
no more marching powder.

13:11.840 --> 13:13.190
That silly drug.

13:13.240 --> 13:16.270
(Isn't it? It's so boring.)

13:16.320 --> 13:18.120
Everybody just...

13:19.600 --> 13:21.670
Fucking love you.

13:21.720 --> 13:23.030
I'm a changed man.

13:23.080 --> 13:24.830
- Oh, my God.
- Do you believe me?

13:24.880 --> 13:26.630
- You have to believe me, OK?
- Oh...

13:26.680 --> 13:28.910
This is the new me you're talking
to. What are you laughing at?

13:28.960 --> 13:31.030
'Cause I think that you
think you actually mean it.

13:31.080 --> 13:33.070
I do mean it.

13:33.120 --> 13:35.260
I do mean it, my darling.

13:36.480 --> 13:38.550
Hey, is Barn coming in?

13:39.520 --> 13:41.070
Not today.

13:41.120 --> 13:42.990
I gotta talk to him.

13:43.040 --> 13:45.480
He cannot marry Scarlet.

13:46.560 --> 13:48.430
It's never gonna last.

13:48.480 --> 13:51.120
She's got a roving eye, that girl.

13:52.240 --> 13:54.320
A roving eye.

13:58.480 --> 14:00.000
Roving...

14:33.360 --> 14:35.190
Bloody hell. He's still alive.

14:35.240 --> 14:38.230
OK. Take it easy there.

14:38.280 --> 14:40.390
Heaven or hell?

14:40.440 --> 14:42.910
Yeah, bit of both, eh?

14:42.960 --> 14:44.760
New Zealand, bro.

14:45.400 --> 14:49.200
We found the balloon guy, and
he's alive and responsive.

14:49.720 --> 14:52.060
We need to get an ambulance.

14:58.320 --> 15:00.430
He's alive!

15:00.480 --> 15:02.230
I just spoke to him. He's alive.

15:02.280 --> 15:05.230
They're flying him home in two days!

15:05.280 --> 15:06.990
We're here today on the beach...

15:07.040 --> 15:08.150
Oh, my goodness!

15:08.200 --> 15:10.950
.. Australian balloon
has landed and our...

15:11.000 --> 15:12.840
Oh, my goodness.

15:17.240 --> 15:18.310
Oh, look!

15:18.360 --> 15:20.670
Look, there he is, Mum!

15:20.720 --> 15:22.910
Mr Meagher is currently under observation

15:22.960 --> 15:25.160
at Auckland City Hospital.

15:29.720 --> 15:31.110
Hey, you.

15:31.160 --> 15:33.390
Hey, you. Hi.

15:33.440 --> 15:38.110
Look, this... this whole thing with
Barney has been a really big deal,

15:38.160 --> 15:40.110
especially for the kids.

15:40.160 --> 15:42.110
I understand. I don't have to stay.

15:42.160 --> 15:45.150
I just wanted to drop this off
to celebrate the good news.

15:45.200 --> 15:47.110
Isn't it great about Barney?

15:47.160 --> 15:50.190
- 50,000 to 1, they're saying.
- Yeah. It's wonderful.

15:50.240 --> 15:51.470
But I...

15:51.520 --> 15:54.910
But not now. Right.

15:54.960 --> 15:58.190
Everything's still up in the air. Ha.

15:58.240 --> 16:00.630
Another time. Soon.

16:00.680 --> 16:01.990
No, wait. Wait.

16:02.040 --> 16:04.750
Actually, why don't you
come in and say hello?

16:04.800 --> 16:07.540
They are over the moon at the moment.

16:07.680 --> 16:10.670
We can just tell them that
you're an old friend of Dad's

16:10.720 --> 16:12.990
and you're here to celebrate.

16:13.040 --> 16:17.190
Oh... You don't think telling
them I'm a friend of their dad's

16:17.240 --> 16:19.430
might make things a little
trickier in the longer term?

16:19.480 --> 16:20.870
- Why?
- Well...

16:20.920 --> 16:24.430
When you and I eventually
come out in the open -- soon --

16:24.480 --> 16:26.590
I'd like them to know me without
the pressure of seeing me

16:26.640 --> 16:28.550
as some sort of stepfather figure who...

16:28.600 --> 16:29.800
Zoe.

16:31.400 --> 16:33.190
This is David.

16:33.240 --> 16:35.640
He's an old friend of Daddy's.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.680
Hello.

16:52.280 --> 16:55.520
- Hey.
- Hey. How are you?

16:56.600 --> 16:58.190
How's the head?

16:58.240 --> 17:00.780
Oh, little rough round the edges.

17:01.640 --> 17:04.119
I don't know. You tell me...

17:05.119 --> 17:06.230
.. pussycat.

17:06.280 --> 17:08.470
Pussycat?

17:08.520 --> 17:10.589
Will it hurt if I lay down next to you?

17:10.640 --> 17:15.150
If I said you had a beautiful
body, would you hold it against me?

17:15.200 --> 17:18.680
Oh, you had me out of my mind with worry.

17:19.640 --> 17:21.430
Well...

17:21.480 --> 17:23.950
.. I have that effect on people.

17:26.160 --> 17:27.920
So... how's...

17:29.240 --> 17:30.590
.. how's everything?

17:30.640 --> 17:32.510
All good your end?

17:34.160 --> 17:36.670
You are out of it, aren't you?

17:36.720 --> 17:38.520
Little bit, yeah.

17:39.480 --> 17:41.270
I, um...

17:41.320 --> 17:43.590
.. I oiled the chair today.

17:44.960 --> 17:46.430
- Did you?
- Mmm.

17:46.480 --> 17:49.080
I couldn't stop thinking about you.

17:49.200 --> 17:53.400
I think it's the most beautiful
thing anyone's ever given me.

17:53.480 --> 17:55.510
- The chair...
- Mmm.

17:55.560 --> 17:56.990
The chair...

17:57.040 --> 18:00.550
Danish, handcrafted, guaranteed
not to hurt a living soul.

18:00.600 --> 18:01.800
Mmm.

18:03.120 --> 18:04.910
Do you remember who I am?

18:04.960 --> 18:06.390
Yes!

18:06.440 --> 18:08.070
- Who am I?
- Uh...

18:08.120 --> 18:13.430
Look, OK, my memory's not quite up
to snuff, alright, at the moment.

18:13.480 --> 18:15.830
I hope this doesn't... muddy the waters,

18:15.880 --> 18:21.830
but I'm... really trying to put
my marriage back on the rails.

18:21.880 --> 18:23.590
Oh, your marriage.

18:23.640 --> 18:25.550
We're actually having a baby.

18:25.600 --> 18:28.110
- Mmm. - So... you know,
I'm changing my life.

18:28.160 --> 18:30.070
Oh, of course you are. Mmm.

18:30.120 --> 18:32.060
- I'm sorry.
- Mmm.

18:35.480 --> 18:37.430
Having said that...

18:37.480 --> 18:44.550
.. I always keep a little, um... gap
in my diary on Thursday afternoons

18:44.600 --> 18:46.600
for, you know, just...

18:47.360 --> 18:48.510
.. little treats.

18:48.560 --> 18:50.150
Oh.

18:50.200 --> 18:52.630
So your wife is having a baby?

18:52.680 --> 18:55.470
Baby boy. Finnegan, we think.

18:55.520 --> 18:57.870
Mm-hm. But we can fuck
on Thursday afternoons.

18:57.920 --> 19:00.670
Oh, not just fuck. Lunch too.

19:00.720 --> 19:02.190
Oh.

19:02.240 --> 19:03.590
And, you know, slap-up.

19:03.640 --> 19:05.830
Wow. Really?

19:05.880 --> 19:08.270
- Mmm, good lunch and a root?
- Mmm.

19:08.320 --> 19:11.910
And this is what you want
on Thursday afternoons

19:11.960 --> 19:13.550
in your heart of hearts?

19:13.600 --> 19:15.310
Mm-hm.

19:15.360 --> 19:18.790
If... um, Thursdays are tricky,

19:18.840 --> 19:22.120
I can always move things on Wednesday.

19:45.200 --> 19:46.740
The chair...

19:47.920 --> 19:50.800
Felicity! Felicity!

19:52.400 --> 19:53.800
Felicity!

19:54.720 --> 19:56.510
I'm sorry. It was the drugs.

19:56.560 --> 19:59.510
It was the drugs. I've been
in a drug-induced coma.

19:59.560 --> 20:00.790
You weren't in a coma.

20:00.840 --> 20:02.910
You just had drugs,

20:02.960 --> 20:04.510
and the poor fools didn't realise

20:04.560 --> 20:08.360
just how many drugs you need
to conceal your true self.

20:08.520 --> 20:09.750
I'm sensing an issue here.

20:09.800 --> 20:12.270
You hit on me 15 seconds ago.

20:12.320 --> 20:13.670
What's the problem with that?

20:13.720 --> 20:16.910
You kindly offered me a good lunch
and a root on Thursday afternoons.

20:16.960 --> 20:20.590
OK. Look, look, look,
look -- I was in a...

20:20.640 --> 20:22.070
With the drugs, alright?

20:22.120 --> 20:23.310
I was in the past.

20:23.360 --> 20:25.110
It's not the past, Cleaver.

20:25.160 --> 20:27.910
Your past and present
just sing in harmony.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.760
That is who you are. It's your nature.

20:31.680 --> 20:33.390
I can't be with someone I can't trust.

20:33.440 --> 20:35.150
It's just... it's too exhausting.

20:35.200 --> 20:36.510
Can you... Oh, just...

20:36.560 --> 20:39.510
Honestly, cut me a little
bit of slack, alright?

20:39.560 --> 20:42.190
I've just gone through a fucking window

20:42.240 --> 20:43.910
dangling from a hot air balloon.

20:43.960 --> 20:47.960
Yeah, it's just another day
at the office for you, Cleave.

20:48.440 --> 20:50.110
Goodbye.

20:50.160 --> 20:53.390
Oh, come on. Oh, come on!

20:53.440 --> 20:55.400
Oh, Felicity!

20:59.120 --> 21:00.800
Edgar...

21:02.280 --> 21:05.160
Oh, fucking shitting hell.

21:08.480 --> 21:12.790
Kids, what did we say
about phones at dinner?

21:12.840 --> 21:14.390
Hmm?

21:14.440 --> 21:15.840
Kids!

21:16.800 --> 21:18.540
We have a guest.

21:21.200 --> 21:23.830
So, guys, how are we all doing?

21:23.880 --> 21:26.680
Our father nearly died today.

21:28.240 --> 21:31.910
Well, yes. Isn't he great he... didn't?

21:31.960 --> 21:34.510
We love him very much, you know.

21:34.560 --> 21:38.390
Well, he's brave and
wonderful man, your father.

21:38.440 --> 21:40.310
Must be very proud.

21:45.720 --> 21:48.720
What did we say about
phones at dinner, Mum?

21:49.200 --> 21:51.350
It's work. I have to take it.

21:51.400 --> 21:54.750
Yeah. Yeah.

21:54.800 --> 21:56.270
Yeah.

21:56.320 --> 21:58.200
Fuck!

21:59.840 --> 22:02.550
How many charges? OK, look, OK.

22:02.600 --> 22:06.160
Listen to me, Brian -- you need to
stop speaking now. I'll come down.

22:08.920 --> 22:11.030
Um...

22:11.080 --> 22:12.590
So...

22:12.640 --> 22:18.550
I, uh... I have a client
who needs urgent help.

22:18.600 --> 22:23.230
I recently got him out on bail, but
he's done some things that are...

22:23.280 --> 22:24.350
.. not good.

22:24.400 --> 22:25.920
Oh.

22:26.920 --> 22:30.720
Uh... Well, um... that's OK.
I'm happy to hang with the kids.

22:32.240 --> 22:34.380
- (Thank you.)
- (Yeah.)

22:35.400 --> 22:38.360
- Look, I'll be an hour, tops.
- Mmm.

22:40.800 --> 22:42.280
Bye, Mum.

22:43.720 --> 22:45.390
There she goes.

22:52.080 --> 22:54.000
OK? See you soon.

22:56.440 --> 22:57.960
Love you.

23:12.080 --> 23:13.750
Hold it where you are! Freeze!

23:13.800 --> 23:15.430
Get that bloke! Get him!

23:15.480 --> 23:18.000
- Tasers!
- No! No! No tasers!

23:24.360 --> 23:25.880
Come on.

23:32.120 --> 23:33.470
You're making a big mistake here.

23:33.520 --> 23:36.110
Don't think so, Edgar.
We know who you are.

23:36.160 --> 23:37.270
I know who I am.

23:37.320 --> 23:39.190
Just saying when I learn your name,

23:39.240 --> 23:42.180
you'll realise you've made a big mistake.

23:47.400 --> 23:49.110
In my father's house,

23:49.160 --> 23:52.320
there are many jail cells and
many people to join me there.

23:53.560 --> 23:55.100
Nice dress.

24:09.840 --> 24:12.830
OK, guys. Who's up for a game of Monopoly?

24:12.880 --> 24:14.830
We don't have that app.

24:14.880 --> 24:17.750
Well, it's not an app.
It's the real thing.

24:17.800 --> 24:21.000
And guess who happened
to bring a set with him?

24:21.280 --> 24:22.800
Guys?

24:27.680 --> 24:29.830
Can you please get me a doctor?

24:29.880 --> 24:33.230
I... I... actually asked to
see a doctor a decade ago.

24:33.280 --> 24:36.320
He'll see you when he does his
rounds -- just enjoy your meal.

24:37.520 --> 24:39.630
Oh, this is a meal?

24:39.680 --> 24:41.870
I actually think there
might have been a mistake.

24:41.920 --> 24:44.230
I suspect this was meant for pathology.

24:44.280 --> 24:49.270
From the smell, I would say that
this is a vitamised stool sample

24:49.320 --> 24:52.990
from a patient with a
lifelong bowel obstruction

24:53.040 --> 24:54.790
which suddenly cleared,

24:54.840 --> 24:57.190
and someone in the kitchen -- and
I'm not levelling blame here --

24:57.240 --> 24:59.670
has mistaken it for food,

24:59.720 --> 25:01.430
put garnish around it

25:01.480 --> 25:04.480
and given it a name -- chicken korma.

25:05.480 --> 25:08.110
Oh, come on. Can you just get me a doctor?

25:08.160 --> 25:12.800
I've got to get the
garnished fuck out of here!

25:17.440 --> 25:18.920
Oh.

25:27.960 --> 25:30.030
Not so good?

25:30.080 --> 25:31.520
It was...

25:32.800 --> 25:34.600
It'll get better.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.910
What went wrong?

25:38.960 --> 25:40.360
Monopoly.

25:44.280 --> 25:45.390
Mum!

25:45.440 --> 25:47.320
It's Dad, it's Dad!

25:49.360 --> 25:51.630
You...

25:51.680 --> 25:54.550
.. my beautiful, beautiful children.

25:54.600 --> 25:56.390
How I wish I could be about

25:56.440 --> 26:01.510
to see you grow into the terrific
people I know you'll become.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.190
Grab it, guys.

26:03.240 --> 26:07.190
Embrace it with passion and joy.

26:07.240 --> 26:09.880
This is all there is.

26:11.280 --> 26:12.880
To Scarlet...

26:14.120 --> 26:16.860
.. the first great love of my life...

26:17.440 --> 26:21.430
.. I only wish I'd had more
understanding of who we were

26:21.480 --> 26:23.230
and who we would become.

26:23.280 --> 26:27.110
That night you spent with
Cleaver made me want to die.

26:27.160 --> 26:30.590
I only hope that David
will treat you well,

26:30.640 --> 26:33.430
and you find the happiness you deserve.

26:33.480 --> 26:36.280
Because now up here, in the heavens...

26:36.600 --> 26:39.270
.. all those things seem so trivial.

26:40.800 --> 26:43.350
What have I told you kids about
using these things after 9:00?

26:43.400 --> 26:45.680
Now, go... go to bed.

26:54.600 --> 26:56.200
What is that?

26:58.160 --> 27:00.300
I'm hoping it's Vegemite.

27:00.920 --> 27:04.440
To Scarlet, the first
great love of my life...

27:05.560 --> 27:08.030
I only wish I'd had more
understanding of who we were

27:08.080 --> 27:09.270
and who we'd become.

27:09.320 --> 27:11.790
I wish we could've made it work.

27:13.280 --> 27:14.750
Beautiful, resonant words,

27:14.800 --> 27:19.520
now beamed around the world from
a hero who thought he was dying.

27:29.520 --> 27:33.270
Hooray, hooray, he's alive.

27:33.320 --> 27:35.790
At 5:57pm yesterday,

27:35.840 --> 27:37.110
officers from this department

27:37.160 --> 27:40.190
arrested Edgar Allen Thompson
outside an aged care facility.

27:40.240 --> 27:44.350
As you know, Mr. Thompson is
wanted on 126 separate charges

27:44.400 --> 27:46.870
ranging from murder to drug dealing,

27:46.920 --> 27:51.030
weapons smuggling, extortion
and bribing public officials.

27:51.080 --> 27:53.270
I do not need to remind the media

27:53.320 --> 27:56.320
to be extremely careful with
the way you manage this story.

28:00.400 --> 28:01.790
Barney, how are you, mate?

28:01.840 --> 28:04.150
Now, I understand you're
poised to hop onto a plane

28:04.200 --> 28:06.270
and head back into the
arms of your loved ones.

28:06.320 --> 28:08.870
Tell me, how does it
feel to be a hero, mate?

28:08.920 --> 28:10.230
Oh, not a hero, Cal.

28:10.280 --> 28:12.270
Just a cold guy in a basket.

28:12.320 --> 28:14.510
Well, forgive me if I choose to differ.

28:14.560 --> 28:16.830
I mean, the odds of surviving
what you went through

28:16.880 --> 28:17.950
must be a billion to one.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.390
Well, they're estimating 50,000
to 1, but I was very lucky.

28:21.440 --> 28:23.510
Mate, buy a lottery ticket.

28:23.560 --> 28:25.470
Millions of us across the world

28:25.520 --> 28:28.550
shared what you thought at the
time were your parting words.

28:28.600 --> 28:30.390
They did? How?

28:30.440 --> 28:32.550
Well, I don't mind saying
that this old stormtrooper here

28:32.600 --> 28:33.830
shed a quiet tear.

28:33.880 --> 28:36.470
I hope I go out saying
something that profound.

28:36.520 --> 28:38.910
Well, I don't remember what I said,

28:38.960 --> 28:41.470
but being up in the air
gives you time to reflect.

28:41.520 --> 28:43.470
Did someone download my phone?

28:43.520 --> 28:44.830
On your monitor now.

28:44.880 --> 28:46.550
I'm just going to put you
on hold there, Barney.

28:46.600 --> 28:48.150
Seems we have a newsflash.

28:48.200 --> 28:50.350
- Meg, what's up?
- Thanks, Cal.

28:50.400 --> 28:54.670
Yes, in breaking news, a big win
for the New South Wales Police today

28:54.720 --> 28:58.030
as they swooped in and
arrested Edgar Thompson,

28:58.080 --> 29:02.910
the number one most wanted man
in the country '97 through '99.

29:02.960 --> 29:05.790
Ex-lawyer Thompson flew out of the country

29:05.840 --> 29:07.990
despite having surrendered his passport

29:08.040 --> 29:10.750
at his initial bail hearing 19 years ago.

29:10.800 --> 29:15.390
How this occurred is only one of
countless questions to be answered

29:15.440 --> 29:18.830
in what may prove to be
the trial of the century.

29:18.880 --> 29:21.680
More details at 5:00. Back to you, Cal.

29:24.800 --> 29:26.280
Uh...

29:30.560 --> 29:33.680
Three years ago we faced
annihilation as a party.

29:35.200 --> 29:38.070
And now we're almost level
pegging in some of the polls.

29:38.120 --> 29:39.950
With a by-election in
the Hunter coming up,

29:40.000 --> 29:42.350
we're getting some momentum back.

29:42.400 --> 29:45.550
We've done the hard yards, we've
publicly confronted our demons,

29:45.600 --> 29:47.670
we've got rid of the...

29:47.880 --> 29:49.630
.. got rid of the corruption and dead wood

29:49.680 --> 29:52.480
that's been eating away at this party.

29:53.160 --> 29:55.070
Now, I know it's been painful but...

29:55.120 --> 29:57.150
Has there been another bomb scare?

29:57.200 --> 29:59.110
Edgar Thompson's just been arrested.

29:59.160 --> 30:02.030
So? How does that affect anyone in here?

30:04.880 --> 30:07.030
Oh, no.

30:07.080 --> 30:09.230
Oh, God no, please!

30:09.280 --> 30:11.110
What don't I know that I need to know?

30:11.160 --> 30:13.830
Would you excuse me for just a tick?

30:15.880 --> 30:17.560
(Oh, Jesus!)

30:25.240 --> 30:26.750
Don't tell me to calm down!

30:26.800 --> 30:30.230
I will not calm down while that man
is unsafely under lock and key!

30:30.280 --> 30:32.030
I mean, what in God's name
is he doing in the country

30:32.080 --> 30:33.190
in the first place?

30:33.240 --> 30:36.790
I thought he was nicely tucked
away in some estate outside Moscow.

30:36.840 --> 30:39.230
- His mother is dying.
- Oh, big shit!

30:39.280 --> 30:40.870
Everyone's mother dies at some point!

30:40.920 --> 30:43.470
Couldn't he have bought her
flowers or something?! Jesus.

30:43.520 --> 30:46.310
And what overzealous prick
arrested him in the first place?

30:46.360 --> 30:50.110
I mean, Jesus, it's in no-one's
interest to have him incarcerated.

30:50.160 --> 30:53.030
He has greased a shitload
of palms, Morris.

30:53.080 --> 30:55.230
Well, how likely is he to spill the beans?

30:55.280 --> 30:56.910
It's not a question of
Ed spilling the beans.

30:56.960 --> 30:59.230
It's a question of making
sure the beans don't talk,

30:59.280 --> 31:01.550
that the beans have been
strangled with razor wire

31:01.600 --> 31:04.350
and shot point blank
through their bean skulls

31:04.400 --> 31:06.870
in front of their bean children!

31:07.320 --> 31:09.430
This affects both sides.

31:09.480 --> 31:11.510
Surely we can shut him down?

31:11.560 --> 31:13.790
I mean, the man's already in solitary.

31:13.840 --> 31:16.710
Ed Thompson's never in solitary, Morris.

31:17.120 --> 31:19.190
He is connected in arcane ways

31:19.240 --> 31:22.110
to everyone and everything in this city.

31:22.840 --> 31:24.910
Maybe even this planet.

31:27.080 --> 31:29.820
A lot of people are going to die now.

31:31.720 --> 31:34.660
This, uh... Guatemalan passport of yours.

31:35.440 --> 31:37.670
It's a good fake. Where'd you get it?

31:37.720 --> 31:39.270
It's not a fake, detective.

31:39.320 --> 31:41.430
I became a Guatemalan
citizen 15 years ago.

31:41.480 --> 31:43.390
Really? Why's that?

31:43.440 --> 31:45.110
It's just that the
moment I set foot there,

31:45.160 --> 31:47.960
I realised I'd found my spiritual home.

31:49.280 --> 31:52.270
Of course, I'll be seeking my
country's consular assistance

31:52.320 --> 31:55.520
in order to avoid an
unjust custodial sentence.

31:56.240 --> 31:59.240
I'm a very close personal
friend of President Zacapa.

32:01.600 --> 32:04.030
Funny word, that isn't it, 'custodial'?

32:04.080 --> 32:05.950
Not really very threatening at all.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.390
More like a sort of a ballroom dance.

32:07.440 --> 32:09.790
"Care to join me in a custodial?"

32:09.840 --> 32:11.190
How about prison then, hmm?

32:11.240 --> 32:12.870
- How about the slammer?
- That's better.

32:12.920 --> 32:14.550
More threat.

32:14.600 --> 32:18.240
Conjures up a solid image of deprivation.

32:22.120 --> 32:24.990
Jesus, I could murder a drink right now.

32:26.080 --> 32:29.190
You probably fancy a drink
too, don't you, Warwick?

32:29.240 --> 32:32.880
I mean, isn't that why you and
Grace are having counselling?

32:34.120 --> 32:37.060
An addiction is nothing to be ashamed of.

32:37.680 --> 32:40.280
We all have our little weaknesses.

32:41.440 --> 32:45.070
I myself am particularly
susceptible to colds.

32:45.120 --> 32:46.630
Turn it off.

32:46.680 --> 32:48.550
I'll not see Warwick
humiliated in this way.

32:48.600 --> 32:51.440
Do not turn it back on until I say so.

32:53.160 --> 32:56.230
It's a tough job keeping a marriage
together these days, isn't it?

32:56.280 --> 32:58.790
I mean, God knows I struggled.

32:58.840 --> 33:01.030
There you are, you and Grace --

33:01.080 --> 33:04.280
15 years together, two lovely children.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.140
Take a break, detective.

33:19.000 --> 33:22.100
I thought I sensed you
there behind the lens.

33:37.560 --> 33:39.300
We're alone now.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.590
My love. So many years.

33:44.640 --> 33:48.070
I'm... I'm so sorry about all this.

33:48.120 --> 33:49.670
I just... It was beyond my control.

33:49.720 --> 33:51.670
I know, I know. It wasn't your fault.

33:51.720 --> 33:53.860
But I couldn't stop them.

33:55.440 --> 33:56.670
I understand.

33:56.720 --> 33:58.200
Mmm...

34:06.680 --> 34:08.280
My darling...

34:09.239 --> 34:11.590
.. the years have been kinder to
you than they have been to me.

34:11.639 --> 34:13.590
It's been an eternity.

34:13.639 --> 34:16.350
Just... just to see your face.

34:16.400 --> 34:19.670
You were there with me, the whole time.

34:19.719 --> 34:23.070
In the pouring deluge, in
those brooding mountains...

34:24.120 --> 34:26.659
.. you were there the whole time.

34:29.239 --> 34:34.159
I, uh... I don't know how to stop this.

34:35.560 --> 34:37.679
Fortunately, I do.

34:40.239 --> 34:43.630
Some old acquaintances are going
to come by and seek you out.

34:43.679 --> 34:45.790
You're going to explain to each of them

34:45.840 --> 34:49.630
that I'm feeling... a little bit upset,

34:49.679 --> 34:51.909
a little bit let-down,

34:51.960 --> 34:54.560
that my patience is not infinite...

34:55.080 --> 34:58.150
.. and that I genuinely do know
where the bodies are buried.

35:02.600 --> 35:06.670
What are the odds of hanging
upside down from a balloon

35:06.720 --> 35:11.550
and crashing through that particular
window with Ed Thompson inside?

35:11.600 --> 35:12.870
I mean, it's gotta be a million...

35:12.920 --> 35:15.070
.. that's got to be a
quintillion to one or something.

35:15.120 --> 35:17.790
That's monkeys typing Shakespeare.

35:17.840 --> 35:20.670
- Who is this Ed Thompson guy?
- Who's Ed Thompson?

35:20.720 --> 35:23.630
Well, anybody who's been close to Ed...

35:23.680 --> 35:26.870
Well, most of them are dead right now.

35:26.920 --> 35:29.070
But we'll be right, mate. Don't you worry.

35:29.120 --> 35:30.790
Um... I'll go get the car.

35:30.840 --> 35:33.390
I'll come with you. I'm
bipedal, for Christ sakes!

35:33.440 --> 35:36.270
No, hospital policy, apparently.
Anyway, I parked a mile away.

35:36.320 --> 35:37.470
I'll be five minutes.

35:37.520 --> 35:40.950
For God's sakes, keep to the left,
Fuzzy, in the hospital environs.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.470
On your right!

35:42.520 --> 35:44.830
Oh. Sorry.

35:44.880 --> 35:46.110
You go through.

35:46.160 --> 35:47.550
Yeah, trying to, but
you've gotta move back.

35:47.600 --> 35:50.070
- Yeah, yeah.
- Hey!

35:50.120 --> 35:52.150
Yep. Whoa, it's alright, mate. Just move!

35:52.200 --> 35:53.150
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:53.200 --> 35:56.600
- Yeah, well just... spin it round.
- Bloody hell.

35:57.040 --> 36:00.310
Ow! You... fuckin' idiot!

36:00.360 --> 36:01.630
- Sorry, sorry.
- I said move back.

36:01.680 --> 36:03.550
Yeah, alright. Believe
me, I'm trying, mate.

36:03.600 --> 36:05.230
I'm not your mate.

36:05.280 --> 36:06.670
I said sorry, alright?

36:06.720 --> 36:07.950
Yeah, and what are you sorry for?

36:08.000 --> 36:10.230
Jamming my hand or just
being a total arsehole?

36:10.280 --> 36:11.510
What's with you?

36:11.560 --> 36:14.160
Like I give a shit for your sorry.

36:14.600 --> 36:16.470
It was an accident, ace.

36:16.520 --> 36:19.950
Oh, I'm fuckin' ace now, am I?

36:20.000 --> 36:23.120
Another fuckin' wheelie
telling me to pull my head in?

36:25.800 --> 36:29.870
Oh, it's a miracle!

36:29.920 --> 36:31.430
I can walk!

36:31.480 --> 36:33.630
Oh, I can walk!

36:33.680 --> 36:37.070
Oh! Oh, take me to the water!

36:37.120 --> 36:39.310
Hey, you want a piece of me, mate?

36:39.360 --> 36:40.630
- Sure, I want a piece.
- You want a piece?

36:40.680 --> 36:43.030
You want a piece of this, huh?
Come on, come on. Have a...

36:43.080 --> 36:44.870
Yeah, well you give it your best shot.

36:44.920 --> 36:47.590
- Come on. Come on,
Fluffy, have a go. - Huh?

36:47.640 --> 36:48.670
- Best shot.
- Come on, then.

36:48.720 --> 36:50.670
Ooh! Ooh, you scared?

36:50.720 --> 36:53.270
Have a go. Have a go mate, huh?

36:53.320 --> 36:54.270
Huh?

36:54.320 --> 36:55.880
Oh, shit!

36:58.360 --> 37:00.270
Fuckin' turd.

37:00.320 --> 37:01.920
Oh, God.

37:08.480 --> 37:11.480
What do you say to a
little stroll, Cleave?

37:12.680 --> 37:14.470
Get a bit of fresh air.

37:14.520 --> 37:16.280
Put this in.

37:22.240 --> 37:23.950
- Hello?
- Cleave!

37:24.000 --> 37:25.630
Cleave.

37:25.680 --> 37:28.390
Sorry -- we didn't get to catch
up much the other day, did we?

37:28.440 --> 37:29.950
Uh, hi, Ed.

37:30.000 --> 37:33.510
Um... yeah, no, I've just
been released from hospital.

37:33.560 --> 37:37.110
I'm pretty crook, actually.
They reckon I need to rest up.

37:37.160 --> 37:38.750
Well, you know, the funny thing is,

37:38.800 --> 37:41.030
I so don't care.

37:41.080 --> 37:43.630
I need you to get me bail, Cleaver.

37:43.680 --> 37:45.230
You'd do that for an old
friend, wouldn't you?

37:45.280 --> 37:46.470
You want me to get you bail?

37:46.520 --> 37:48.470
Mate, they're not going to give you bail.

37:48.520 --> 37:50.310
You should know that better than anyone.

37:50.360 --> 37:53.750
The things we value most
are the things we fight for.

37:53.800 --> 37:55.790
Ed, given that you bolted last time,

37:55.840 --> 37:57.190
the number of serious charges,

37:57.240 --> 38:00.030
the number of curiously
related and subsequent deaths,

38:00.080 --> 38:02.670
I really can't see any judge
giving you bail, mate,

38:02.720 --> 38:04.790
as short-sighted as that may seem.

38:04.840 --> 38:08.310
Cleaver, if I brief you, you can't
possibly testify against me.

38:08.360 --> 38:11.960
Everything you know about
me then becomes privileged.

38:12.680 --> 38:14.470
It's the only strategy I could think of

38:14.520 --> 38:17.110
that didn't involve having you killed.

38:17.160 --> 38:19.110
And I'm doing it because at heart

38:19.160 --> 38:21.550
I'm really just an old sentimentalist.

38:21.600 --> 38:25.430
Look, I... I could try for home
detention with an ankle bracelet.

38:25.480 --> 38:26.670
Cleaver,

38:26.720 --> 38:28.550
"Lay this unto your breast

38:28.600 --> 38:32.600
"Old friends, like old swords
Still are trusted best."

38:34.080 --> 38:37.070
You're not sick of seeing
sunsets yet, are you Cleaver?

38:37.120 --> 38:38.790
Not really, no.

38:40.520 --> 38:42.460
There you are, then.

38:47.080 --> 38:49.080
Bye, Cleave.

38:52.720 --> 38:55.240
Shit! Fuck! Fuck!

39:01.440 --> 39:02.830
Where have you been?

39:02.880 --> 39:06.190
Oh, I got in a f... Well, someone hit me.

39:06.240 --> 39:07.950
- What?
- While you were in a wheelchair?

39:08.000 --> 39:09.950
What kind of arsehole
hits a guy in a wheelchair?

39:10.000 --> 39:13.590
Oh, let's just get the
screaming Jesus out of here.

39:13.640 --> 39:15.470
I'm a sitting duck.

39:15.520 --> 39:16.950
OK, well... where am I going?

39:17.000 --> 39:19.270
I don't know -- anywhere.
I can't go to my place.

39:19.320 --> 39:21.670
Let's just drive round in circles.

39:21.720 --> 39:23.030
Hang out together.

39:23.080 --> 39:24.550
No, I'm staying at Monique's.

39:24.600 --> 39:26.590
Perfect. We'll stay at Monique's.

39:26.640 --> 39:27.990
Who's Monique?

39:28.040 --> 39:30.550
Girl I met a few nights
back. It's no go, Cleave.

39:30.600 --> 39:33.590
Oh, God, it's like looking
in a circus mirror.

39:33.640 --> 39:35.790
What about Felicity's?

39:35.840 --> 39:37.750
I'm afraid that ship has sailed.

39:37.800 --> 39:39.740
Barney and Nicole's?

39:41.960 --> 39:45.240
Ah, I suspect I'm about to
be offered an alternative.

39:49.280 --> 39:50.480
Dad!

39:52.280 --> 39:53.790
Just be careful!

39:53.840 --> 39:55.160
Dad!

39:56.680 --> 39:58.470
- Hey, mate.
- Barney, welcome home.

39:58.520 --> 40:00.030
How are you feeling?

40:00.080 --> 40:01.630
Dad!

40:01.680 --> 40:03.110
My beautiful girl.

40:03.160 --> 40:04.190
Dad!

40:04.240 --> 40:05.840
My boy.

40:07.200 --> 40:08.310
So wonderful to see you together.

40:08.360 --> 40:11.100
Is there something you'd like to say?

40:12.000 --> 40:13.190
Excuse us.

40:13.240 --> 40:15.270
We've got three children who
are bursting through their skin

40:15.320 --> 40:17.070
to be with their dad.

40:17.120 --> 40:20.070
As you can imagine, it's been a...

40:20.120 --> 40:22.070
.. well, three days filled
with tears and grief,

40:22.120 --> 40:23.910
so they need to spend
some time with father.

40:23.960 --> 40:25.150
Thank you.

40:25.200 --> 40:26.600
In we go.

40:28.280 --> 40:29.790
I need to get to Nicole.

40:29.840 --> 40:31.030
Just one photo before you go in.

40:31.080 --> 40:32.150
I know you've got another baby,

40:32.200 --> 40:33.670
but can you please spend some time

40:33.720 --> 40:35.470
with the children who can
recognise your face first?

40:35.520 --> 40:37.070
Scarlet! One more photo? Barney!

40:37.120 --> 40:39.550
Just a smile together,
the two of you. Scarlet!

40:39.600 --> 40:41.350
It's really good to see you.

40:41.400 --> 40:42.920
And you.

40:45.240 --> 40:47.590
As you can imagine, it's been a...

40:47.640 --> 40:49.750
.. well, three days filled
with tears and grief,

40:49.800 --> 40:51.430
so they need to spend some
time with their father.

40:51.480 --> 40:53.430
Barney, is there anything
else you'd like to say?

40:53.480 --> 40:55.470
Let's get inside.

40:55.520 --> 40:57.110
Thank you very much.

40:57.160 --> 40:58.310
Not a word.

40:58.360 --> 41:00.590
So there he is, back in the
loving arms of his family.

41:00.640 --> 41:03.230
His chances of surviving
this ordeal have been...

41:03.280 --> 41:05.190
- OK.
- I want to sit here, Zoe.

41:05.240 --> 41:06.390
No! Go away.

41:06.440 --> 41:07.950
Relax!

41:08.000 --> 41:09.510
Little monkey!

41:09.560 --> 41:10.990
Dad!

41:14.920 --> 41:17.550
Hey, hey, be careful with your Dad.

41:17.600 --> 41:21.670
- Dad... Dad, do a face!
- Dad, here. Take one with me.

41:21.720 --> 41:23.270
Ha-ha, tricked ya!

41:23.320 --> 41:24.950
I'm not letting you take a picture

41:25.000 --> 41:27.800
'cause you wouldn't let me have your...

41:39.640 --> 41:42.830
I take it your GPS is buggered.

41:42.880 --> 41:51.080
And there is some overarching theme
as to why you brought us here, yeah?

41:52.480 --> 41:55.440
Are we sharing a sunset?

41:56.600 --> 41:59.150
This state is rancid.
It's poison at every level.

41:59.200 --> 42:01.990
Oh, you just got a hold of that? I
could have told you back in Redfern.

42:02.040 --> 42:04.070
You would have saved on petrol.

42:04.120 --> 42:07.230
This Thompson case is going to shake
New South Wales to its foundations.

42:07.280 --> 42:10.630
To be fair, we had pretty dodgy
foundations to start with.

42:10.680 --> 42:12.310
This trial changes that.

42:12.360 --> 42:14.990
Hundreds will fall, I promise you.

42:15.040 --> 42:18.940
I don't care what it takes.
I will make this city decent.

42:19.040 --> 42:21.310
Well, good for you, mate.

42:21.360 --> 42:24.990
Now, can I... can I
just go to bed, please?

42:25.040 --> 42:26.790
- Anybody's...
- It's time for you to choose a side.

42:26.840 --> 42:29.830
You were Edgar Thompson's
associate, his understudy.

42:29.880 --> 42:31.550
You were privy to all his
private conversations,

42:31.600 --> 42:32.830
all his business dealings.

42:32.880 --> 42:34.830
Yeah, I was the associate
in his firm, mate.

42:34.880 --> 42:37.190
I didn't know about any
of the other stuff.

42:37.240 --> 42:39.270
Anyway, he's hired me as his lawyer now,

42:39.320 --> 42:40.790
so I'm bound to client confidentiality...

42:40.840 --> 42:43.230
Don't you fuckin' ethic
me. Don't you ethic me.

42:43.280 --> 42:44.870
I know damn well why he hired you --

42:44.920 --> 42:46.910
so you can't give evidence against him.

42:46.960 --> 42:48.070
You cooperate with me,

42:48.120 --> 42:49.830
'cause I can hurt you 10
times harder than he can.

42:49.880 --> 42:53.510
Oh, I don't think so, mate.
He's very good at hurting people.

42:53.560 --> 42:57.070
These are invoices, signed off by you,

42:57.120 --> 42:59.520
from when you worked with him.

43:00.520 --> 43:03.190
Yeah, Ed used to get me to
do his cheque requisitions.

43:03.240 --> 43:05.990
Of course he did -- so
his name wasn't on them.

43:06.040 --> 43:07.630
This little cheque here --

43:07.680 --> 43:10.510
3rd of August 1996, to
a triad in Hong Kong.

43:10.560 --> 43:12.270
This one here to a bikie gang.

43:12.320 --> 43:14.590
All with your name on them.

43:15.320 --> 43:17.390
There's no statute of limitations on this.

43:17.440 --> 43:22.590
Now, you help me, or you share
a cell with him for life.

43:22.640 --> 43:26.040
I just want to know where
all the dirt is buried.

43:26.280 --> 43:27.390
Great.

43:27.440 --> 43:31.150
A brutal and probably fairly
brief life behind bars

43:31.200 --> 43:32.670
if I don't cooperate,

43:32.720 --> 43:35.200
and certain death if I do.

43:36.680 --> 43:40.270
There's no third option that
involves San Tropez, is there?

43:40.320 --> 43:42.390
I can guarantee your safety.

43:42.440 --> 43:44.630
Mate, if you can guarantee my safety,

43:44.680 --> 43:46.910
why have you brought us out
to fuck stains nowhere?

43:46.960 --> 43:49.830
I don't trust people, but I
can find you a safe place.

43:49.880 --> 43:52.480
- I can't do this.
- Yes, you can.

43:53.480 --> 43:55.310
The bail hearing will fail.

43:55.360 --> 43:57.910
After it's finished,
you exit the side door,

43:57.960 --> 44:00.430
you go across Oxford Street and
you go to the Court House Hotel.

44:00.480 --> 44:02.840
You try and be inconspicuous.

44:03.920 --> 44:06.390
And I'll be waiting for you, OK?

44:08.000 --> 44:10.200
Make mine a Schoeffenbrau.

44:14.520 --> 44:17.430
Oh, no, just drop me at a train station.

44:17.480 --> 44:19.510
You need some time to
consider your options.

44:19.560 --> 44:21.900
Oh, come on! Don't give me...

44:23.720 --> 44:26.950
Fuck is wrong with you?
I'm really... I'm sore.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.670
I went through a window!

44:29.720 --> 44:30.750
Alright?

44:30.800 --> 44:33.600
I've been in hospital, you know, mate.

44:34.480 --> 44:37.320
With... very serious injuries.

44:46.000 --> 44:49.240
Rage, rage Against the dying of the light.

45:02.360 --> 45:03.920
Hello!

45:06.040 --> 45:08.160
Nickybabe, I'm home!

45:09.720 --> 45:12.630
Oh, hi! Welcome back.

45:12.680 --> 45:15.910
- Don't I get a kiss?
- Yeah, 'course. 'Course.

45:15.960 --> 45:17.700
Nice to see you.

45:18.960 --> 45:21.430
I made it. I survived.

45:21.480 --> 45:25.350
Bit of frostbite on the
fingers, but otherwise OK.

45:25.400 --> 45:28.270
I know! 50,000 to 1.

45:28.320 --> 45:29.910
Good for you.

45:29.960 --> 45:32.550
There's a lot of interest in my story.

45:32.600 --> 45:34.350
The telly sent a limo to pick me up...

45:34.400 --> 45:35.430
So how was your night?

45:35.480 --> 45:37.190
Oh.

45:37.240 --> 45:39.430
- I, uh, I tried calling.
- Mm-hm.

45:39.480 --> 45:41.150
You didn't answer.

45:41.200 --> 45:43.340
Then I just fell asleep.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.790
OK. There it is, then.

45:47.840 --> 45:50.030
The kids wanted to see me.

45:50.080 --> 45:52.750
The press were there. I was trapped.

45:54.600 --> 45:56.910
- OK, you saw the mobile footage. - Yep.

45:56.960 --> 45:58.670
Or should I say the absence of it,

45:58.720 --> 46:02.070
because everything on that phone
went viral except any mention of me.

46:02.120 --> 46:05.230
What you didn't hear, because
the bloody battery died,

46:05.280 --> 46:09.190
was me saying how much I adore
you, that you are my saviour.

46:09.240 --> 46:10.910
Oh, all I heard

46:10.960 --> 46:13.870
was how much you wish things
had worked out with Scarlet.

46:13.920 --> 46:15.790
And then she turns out to
be your first port of call.

46:15.840 --> 46:18.910
Nic, I thought this was my last message.

46:18.960 --> 46:21.790
It was never meant to
go to the entire world.

46:21.840 --> 46:24.950
And I promise you, whilst
I did say those things...

46:25.000 --> 46:28.070
Yes. Of course. The battery.

46:28.120 --> 46:29.550
I'm not lying.

46:29.600 --> 46:31.750
No, I don't remember saying that you were.

46:31.800 --> 46:33.750
Oh, go and say hi to our child.

46:33.800 --> 46:36.200
He didn't catch the broadcast.

46:53.320 --> 46:56.260
Thanks, Maria. Yes, it's good to be home.

47:04.640 --> 47:07.150
Cleave, we made it.

47:07.200 --> 47:12.190
I... I gotta crash here and
we gotta get Ed Thompson bail.

47:12.240 --> 47:15.030
What do you mean, we've got
to get Ed Thompson bail?

47:15.080 --> 47:16.510
You're... You're unbelievable.

47:16.560 --> 47:18.070
- Unbelievable!
- What?

47:18.120 --> 47:20.870
You do know I almost died in that balloon?

47:20.920 --> 47:22.350
You almost...?

47:22.400 --> 47:26.190
Mate, I was the one dangling
like a fucking tea bag in the sky

47:26.240 --> 47:30.030
in a kind of Bear Grylls'
extreme survival scenario,

47:30.080 --> 47:33.230
and crashing through plate glass and shit.

47:33.280 --> 47:36.150
- Hypothermia.
- Oh, you were off on a kind of...

47:36.200 --> 47:39.430
I mean, all due respect -- a kind
of Contiki tour of New Zealand.

47:39.480 --> 47:41.510
- Potential permanent lung damage.
- Oh, mate, can we...?

47:41.560 --> 47:43.630
- Look at this. Look at...
- This!

47:43.680 --> 47:45.430
- Frostbite!
- Look... look at that.

47:45.480 --> 47:48.230
And this whole... The whole
area here, they reckon it's...

47:48.280 --> 47:50.230
Up in there, it's done.

47:50.280 --> 47:52.830
- That's done.
- Done, years ago. Self-inflicted.

47:52.880 --> 47:55.070
Listen, listen!

47:55.120 --> 47:57.230
We're all very tired and exhausted, OK?

47:57.280 --> 47:58.950
It's been a difficult time.

47:59.000 --> 48:00.790
I need you to know that Ed Thompson

48:00.840 --> 48:03.190
is serious about needing representation.

48:03.240 --> 48:05.230
Oh, forget it, Cleave. I'm
not going anywhere near him.

48:05.280 --> 48:06.870
Are you crazy?

48:06.920 --> 48:09.310
It's too big. I can't do it by myself.

48:09.360 --> 48:10.470
He'll never get bail.

48:10.520 --> 48:11.950
I know that! It's not the point, mate.

48:12.000 --> 48:13.870
I know that. We all know that.

48:13.920 --> 48:16.190
It's just I need to show that I tried,

48:16.240 --> 48:19.790
and then he might leave me
alone with one little limb.

48:19.840 --> 48:21.790
Get out, Cleave.

48:21.840 --> 48:23.470
He's gonna kill me.

48:23.520 --> 48:27.230
- I hope he's aware there's a queue!
- Will you keep it down!

48:27.280 --> 48:29.190
Oh, that's a nice warm welcome.

48:29.240 --> 48:31.870
Warmth isn't exactly in
my toolbox as we speak.

48:31.920 --> 48:34.830
Oh, for God's sake, I
told you, the battery died.

48:34.880 --> 48:36.990
Battery? What are you two talking about?

48:37.040 --> 48:39.030
Hey, what do you need, Cleaver?

48:39.080 --> 48:41.870
I heard something about a bail
application. Serious, is it?

48:41.920 --> 48:43.950
Yes. Very serious, as a
matter of fact, Nicole.

48:44.000 --> 48:47.390
'Cause I have been thinking
that I have had my little break,

48:47.440 --> 48:49.510
but I am bored, frankly,

48:49.560 --> 48:51.550
and maybe it's time I came back to work.

48:51.600 --> 48:52.910
- Don't do this.
- Great!

48:52.960 --> 48:55.670
So what have we got here?
A juicy little murder?

48:55.720 --> 48:59.310
Yes, well, quite a few juicy
little murders, actually.

48:59.360 --> 49:01.670
- Even better.
- Yeah, yeah.

49:01.720 --> 49:03.670
Some drug smuggling, extortion...

49:03.720 --> 49:04.910
Mmm.

49:04.960 --> 49:07.560
.. money laundering, arms dealing.

49:08.920 --> 49:11.310
Fantastic.

49:11.360 --> 49:12.960
Great. GREAT.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.320
Oh, God. Oh, God.

49:20.720 --> 49:23.310
You are just gonna be so great in there

49:23.360 --> 49:25.790
and I am gonna be with you the whole time.

49:25.840 --> 49:27.350
Just one second.

49:27.400 --> 49:29.470
Mama, I'm already here.

49:31.720 --> 49:33.630
Cleaver.

49:33.680 --> 49:36.280
I have a message from Mr. Thompson.

49:37.360 --> 49:39.550
"The day is lived and done

49:39.600 --> 49:41.350
"The reeling sun

49:41.400 --> 49:45.720
"Hurries away to foster life elsewhere."

49:48.560 --> 49:50.390
Sunsets, right?

49:50.440 --> 49:52.400
No bloody idea.

49:55.160 --> 49:57.080
Sunsets.

50:00.800 --> 50:02.480
All rise.

50:07.560 --> 50:09.440
Right.

50:11.320 --> 50:13.870
I understand we have
an application for bail.

50:13.920 --> 50:17.030
I presume you are opposing
the application, Mr. O'Connor?

50:17.080 --> 50:18.910
We certainly are, Your Honour.

50:18.960 --> 50:21.990
The charges against Edgar
Thompson are so shocking

50:22.040 --> 50:25.310
and he has already demonstrated
himself as a flight risk.

50:25.360 --> 50:30.230
We believe he poses a grave risk
to the community if granted bail.

50:30.280 --> 50:32.550
Mr. Greene?

50:32.600 --> 50:37.030
Your Honour, with respect,
I suspect my friend here

50:37.080 --> 50:40.630
might be embroidering the facts
somewhat for the joy of the media

50:40.680 --> 50:43.190
and for his own political ambitions.

50:43.240 --> 50:48.830
This is a pretty standard old,
run-of-the-mill bail application.

50:48.880 --> 50:52.110
The man was found with 12 passports
at the time of his arrest.

50:52.160 --> 50:54.750
Your Honour, he has been
on the run for 19 years.

50:54.800 --> 50:57.470
There are 126 charges.

50:57.520 --> 51:01.470
Every authority in
Australia was after him.

51:01.520 --> 51:04.190
But did he know that this was the case?

51:04.240 --> 51:06.790
I mean, my understanding is that my client

51:06.840 --> 51:10.150
was leading a pretty
quiet, monastic existence

51:10.200 --> 51:12.510
studying the flora and fauna
of the jungles of Guatemala

51:12.560 --> 51:18.990
and blissfully unaware of the
goings-on of the outside world.

51:19.040 --> 51:22.910
Your Honour, these are
very serious charges,

51:22.960 --> 51:25.310
all of which must have
taken considerable time

51:25.360 --> 51:26.950
and effort in the planning,

51:27.000 --> 51:30.470
and I happen to have here
my client's time sheets

51:30.520 --> 51:33.350
from the firm at which he was a partner

51:33.400 --> 51:36.030
for the relevant 33-month period.

51:36.080 --> 51:39.510
Now, all of these bills
were paid without dispute,

51:39.560 --> 51:44.070
and they average 17.5 hours per day.

51:44.120 --> 51:46.590
What a surprise, Mr. Greene. Are you done?

51:46.640 --> 51:48.070
Um, Your Honour,

51:48.120 --> 51:53.190
my client simply would not have
had the time to be a criminal.

51:53.240 --> 51:55.950
Right. Are you done, Mr. Greene?

51:56.000 --> 52:00.470
Um, my client's mother...

52:00.520 --> 52:02.790
.. is very sick.

52:02.840 --> 52:04.270
Yes, that's a pity.

52:04.320 --> 52:07.190
The application is denied.

52:07.240 --> 52:10.750
He... He can just crash at my joint.

52:10.800 --> 52:12.550
The night is shattered.

52:12.600 --> 52:15.310
The blue stars shiver in the distance.

52:15.360 --> 52:18.470
- Is that a sunset?
- No.

52:18.520 --> 52:20.990
It's night.

52:21.040 --> 52:22.960
God.

52:47.600 --> 52:51.470
Hey. Cleave. You're on a
hiding to nothing with that one.

52:51.520 --> 52:54.060
Feeling left up in the air, mate?

53:19.200 --> 53:20.880
Warwick!

53:31.600 --> 53:34.430
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

53:34.480 --> 53:36.280
Oh, shit!

54:12.920 --> 54:15.310
Wendy, you've got to get in
the car and come and get me.

54:15.360 --> 54:19.990
I'm... I'm in Foster Street
in Darlinghurst, alright?

54:20.040 --> 54:21.830
Yes, it is a matter of life and death,

54:21.880 --> 54:24.480
as a matter of fact, smarty pants.

54:26.040 --> 54:27.550
Hey, Cleave.

54:27.600 --> 54:29.110
Greene.

54:29.160 --> 54:30.800
Your Honour.

54:43.360 --> 54:44.900
Are you OK?

54:46.240 --> 54:47.990
- Drive!
- Where?

54:48.040 --> 54:50.180
Just drive! Drive, drive!

Yes. Yes.

55:12.000 --> 55:13.390
Hi. Murray.

55:13.440 --> 55:16.840
Stop attacking Ed Thompson.
It will not end well.

55:18.720 --> 55:23.670
He must feel like he
has been alive FOREVER!

55:23.720 --> 55:25.150
Are you ashamed of yourself?

55:25.200 --> 55:27.800
- Oh, yes!
- I'll give you a ride.

55:29.480 --> 55:32.080
- Where's Cleaver?
- I don't know.
