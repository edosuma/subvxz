[Marcus] I want to tell you a little story
that was once told to me long ago.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.280
"How do you win a beautiful girl's heart?"

01:06.360 --> 01:09.000
a young lovestruck boy
once asked the wise man.

01:14.400 --> 01:17.480
"Well, if you love a girl," the wise man
said, "and she's beautiful to you,

01:19.280 --> 01:22.520
bring her flowers as a symbol
of your appreciation of that beauty."

01:25.840 --> 01:28.880
"But what do you bring a girl who
already has every flower in the world?"

01:28.960 --> 01:30.480
the young boy replied.

01:30.560 --> 01:32.760
"What more could you possibly bring her?"

01:36.840 --> 01:38.920
The wise man took a moment and smiled.

01:40.760 --> 01:43.040
"Then you bring her laughter," he said.

01:44.560 --> 01:46.720
"That's the most
valuable thing in this world.

01:48.560 --> 01:50.440
You bring her laughter...

01:52.000 --> 01:53.440
and watch her flowers blossom."

02:24.160 --> 02:26.440
Nothing, I'm cool. What's up?

02:29.600 --> 02:32.000
See, I know you've been
feeling a little down recently,

02:33.280 --> 02:35.960
and seeing as you don't wanna talk,
which I do get.

02:37.320 --> 02:41.320
Thought to myself,
what could I possibly do to cheer you up?

02:43.880 --> 02:45.760
I got us two tickets to go somewhere.

but I think the graphic design one's
the best one for me you know, like.

05:11.720 --> 05:13.200
I might look into that a bit more.

05:17.080 --> 05:18.760

You know, like our destiny already
written in the stars kind of thing,

or just the fact that we've risen so fast,

37:14.080 --> 37:16.640
