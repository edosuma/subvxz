08:16.785 --> 08:19.177
I was gonna tell you after
I finished this waffle.

08:19.198 --> 08:20.146
Perfect!

08:20.167 --> 08:21.702
[Clears throat] I mean...

08:21.722 --> 08:22.810
that's so cool.

08:22.831 --> 08:24.805
Love wins.

08:24.825 --> 08:26.473
Aunt Jodi.

08:26.493 --> 08:29.059
Hey, sweetheart! What
are you doing here?

08:29.080 --> 08:30.614
I need to ask you something about Jimmy.

08:30.634 --> 08:32.215
Your mom let him eat
those Styrofoam peanuts

08:32.234 --> 08:32.957
when he was a kid.

08:32.977 --> 08:34.417
I think that's the
reason for everything.

08:34.437 --> 08:36.885
Not this. He got into college.

08:36.905 --> 08:38.548
He did? Yay!

08:38.568 --> 08:41.890
But he's not telling anyone,
and I can't figure out why.

08:41.910 --> 08:43.515
Well, people have their reasons

08:43.535 --> 08:44.917
for keeping things to themselves.

08:44.938 --> 08:45.795
Not Jimmy.

08:45.815 --> 08:47.797
Remember he showed us
his first armpit hair.

08:47.817 --> 08:49.231
Oh. Chris.

08:49.251 --> 08:51.033
I'm just worried that something's wrong.

08:51.053 --> 08:53.169
And you're so good at
getting people to open up.

08:53.189 --> 08:54.111
It's true.

08:54.132 --> 08:56.248
Something about the way
that I touch people's hair.

08:56.269 --> 08:59.608
Sherry just told me that she's
making her kids sick on purpose.

08:59.628 --> 09:01.911
[Doorbell chimes]

09:01.931 --> 09:04.447
Hi! Can I help you find something?

09:04.467 --> 09:06.816
Uh, we need an engagement ring.

09:06.836 --> 09:07.750
Oh! When's the date?

09:07.770 --> 09:09.593
Ah, well, we haven't set one yet.

09:09.614 --> 09:11.445
Yeah, he has to get a "yes" first.

09:11.466 --> 09:14.155
Oh, well, you better snap him up,

09:14.176 --> 09:17.660
because I can think of about
15 things I'd like to do to him.

09:17.680 --> 09:19.443
Wow. Everyone is hitting on you today.

09:19.464 --> 09:20.196
Yeah.

09:20.216 --> 09:22.298
Well, I love flirting with you gays.

09:22.318 --> 09:24.867
I can say the most outrageous things

09:24.887 --> 09:27.203
because I know nothing
is ever gonna happen.

09:27.223 --> 09:29.305
Like, um, "Let's go into the stock room

09:29.325 --> 09:30.973
and just [bleep] each other."

09:30.993 --> 09:33.142
We are actually straight.

09:33.162 --> 09:35.729
Oh! My bad.

09:36.799 --> 09:38.647
Well, gentlemen,

09:38.667 --> 09:43.252
I have a wonderful
princess cut right here.

09:43.272 --> 09:44.553
This is beautiful.

09:44.573 --> 09:45.621
Yes. Gorgeous.

09:45.641 --> 09:46.989
Oh, man!

09:47.009 --> 09:50.067
And look how your delicate
fingers really show it off.

09:50.087 --> 09:52.805
There's no way she
says "no" to that ring.

09:52.826 --> 09:55.164
Yes. She's going to love it.

09:55.184 --> 09:56.699
[Chuckles] Huh.

09:56.719 --> 09:58.334
This is so great! It is so exciting.

09:58.354 --> 09:59.835
I mean, there's so much to plan.

09:59.855 --> 10:02.938
Not just the wedding, but we also have
to find you a great place to live.

10:02.958 --> 10:04.607
I hadn't really thought about <i>that.</i>

10:04.627 --> 10:05.908
Know what? Maybe I could talk to Marco

10:05.928 --> 10:07.510
about you taking over my
lease at the Hazelwood.

10:07.530 --> 10:09.066
What? No. I don't want to live there.

10:09.087 --> 10:09.981
That place is the worst.

10:10.001 --> 10:12.256
Uh, okay. Don't yuck my yum.

10:12.277 --> 10:13.827
That is my home, and
those are my friends.

10:13.847 --> 10:15.251
Obviously you have not been to The 'Wood

10:15.271 --> 10:16.379
on "make your own pizza" night.

10:16.399 --> 10:18.287
We make our own pizzas. At night.

10:18.307 --> 10:19.404
Clive, why would I want to live

10:19.424 --> 10:21.023
with a bunch of sad, divorced men?

10:21.043 --> 10:22.892
Well, maybe they don't
want to live in a garage.

10:22.912 --> 10:24.760
Well, if you want me to live
where you've lived before,

10:24.780 --> 10:26.362
why don't I just go
move in with your mother?

10:26.382 --> 10:27.196
You wouldn't!

10:27.216 --> 10:28.297
Oh, I don't know what I'd do.

10:28.317 --> 10:29.832
I'm feeling very unhinged right now.

10:29.852 --> 10:31.233
In fact, suddenly I don't feel

10:31.253 --> 10:32.819
like ring shopping with you anymore.

10:35.925 --> 10:37.273
Lovers' quarrel?

10:37.293 --> 10:41.010
There is so much stress
leading up to the big day.

10:41.030 --> 10:42.611
You said it, sister.

10:42.631 --> 10:44.847
So, we're getting a new
electric toothbrush...

10:44.867 --> 10:45.648
Waffles.

10:45.668 --> 10:47.716
- And hair gel for you.
- Yeah.

10:47.737 --> 10:49.919
- I hope Allison's doing okay.
- Yeah.

10:49.940 --> 10:51.779
You know, I'm really gonna
miss having her around.

10:51.799 --> 10:52.821
Me, too.

10:52.841 --> 10:55.624
[Both laugh]

10:55.644 --> 10:57.193
I thought you were serious.

10:57.213 --> 10:58.761
I thought you were serious.

10:58.781 --> 11:02.464
I love her, but she's
just a lot to take.

11:02.484 --> 11:03.766
And that creepy fish...

11:03.786 --> 11:06.135
It watched me when I
went to the bathroom.

11:06.155 --> 11:07.736
I got weird vibes from that fish, too.

11:07.756 --> 11:09.171
[Air squeaks]
What was that?

11:09.191 --> 11:10.390
It was us.

11:12.129 --> 11:15.012
Do you think she heard us?

11:15.032 --> 11:16.981
Yes.

11:17.001 --> 11:18.200
I heard you.

11:22.453 --> 11:23.534
Allison.

11:23.554 --> 11:25.345
What are you doing in our minivan?

11:25.366 --> 11:27.304
I thought everything with
your parents worked out.

11:27.324 --> 11:28.873
I lied to you about that.

11:28.893 --> 11:31.275
My parents' relationship
was never in trouble.

11:31.295 --> 11:33.143
In fact, they're stronger than ever

11:33.163 --> 11:34.945
because they have a common enemy.

11:34.965 --> 11:36.247
Is it your pervert fish?

11:36.267 --> 11:37.481
No. It's me.

11:37.501 --> 11:40.050
They found out I'm gay,
and they kicked me out.

11:40.070 --> 11:42.186
Oh, my God. Did you come out to them?

11:42.206 --> 11:43.220
No.

11:43.240 --> 11:45.923
But they read my Jennifer Lawrence blog.

11:45.943 --> 11:47.558
And they saw me kissing my girlfriend.

11:47.578 --> 11:49.860
Kind of hard to walk that one back.

11:49.880 --> 11:51.295
Why didn't you tell me?

11:51.315 --> 11:53.330
I didn't want you to feel bad.

11:53.350 --> 11:54.406
They blame you.

11:54.427 --> 11:57.234
They think I became gay
when I joined your LGBT club.

11:57.254 --> 11:58.802
That doesn't make any sense.

11:58.822 --> 11:59.937
That is ridiculous.

11:59.957 --> 12:01.901
Mom, we have to talk
to Allison's parents.

12:01.922 --> 12:04.120
Oh, no. I don't get involved
with other people's business.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.710
Mom, you're the perfect
person to talk to them.

12:05.729 --> 12:08.379
No. I'm sorry, Allison,
but this family business,

12:08.399 --> 12:09.647
your family's business.

12:09.667 --> 12:11.715
That's okay. I can live in your van.

12:11.735 --> 12:13.684
After all, Jewel did it for years.

12:13.704 --> 12:15.052
And how's that working out for her?

12:15.072 --> 12:16.720
When was the last time
you heard from Jewel?

12:16.740 --> 12:19.223
- She...
- Christmas albums don't count.

12:19.243 --> 12:20.724
Oh.

12:20.744 --> 12:22.481
Jimmy: Thanks for texting me

12:22.502 --> 12:24.484
about wanting to give me a free haircut.

12:24.505 --> 12:26.697
- How'd you know I needed it?
- Hairdresser's intuition.

12:26.717 --> 12:28.599
Plus we never get one-on-one time.

12:28.620 --> 12:30.011
Anything new with you?

12:30.032 --> 12:32.002
No. Same old, same old. Oh, my God!

12:32.022 --> 12:33.437
I got into ASU, but I hid the letter

12:33.457 --> 12:34.538
because I don't want to go,

12:34.558 --> 12:36.040
and I accidentally killed Allison's fish

12:36.060 --> 12:37.808
- and replaced it with another one.
- I knew it!

12:37.828 --> 12:39.209
I'm sorry! I hugged it too hard!

12:39.229 --> 12:40.110
No, not that.

12:40.130 --> 12:41.912
Why don't you want to go to college?

12:41.932 --> 12:44.181
Yeah, you've been
working so hard to get in.

12:44.202 --> 12:46.851
'Cause I don't think I'm
ready to leave you guys yet.

12:46.870 --> 12:49.520
I mean, that's what I wrote
my essay about that got me in,

12:49.540 --> 12:50.891
but they're too dumb
to even understand that,

12:50.911 --> 12:53.891
which makes me think that ASU
really is just a party school.

12:53.911 --> 12:55.402
Jimmy, you have to go.

12:55.423 --> 12:56.460
No, I do not.

12:56.480 --> 12:59.330
Anyway, now that mom's having
a baby, we can't afford college.

12:59.351 --> 13:00.332
- What?
- Jimmy!

13:00.353 --> 13:01.832
I can't help it. Her hands are magic.

13:01.852 --> 13:03.100
Your mom's having a baby?

13:03.120 --> 13:04.668
Yes. But nobody else knows.

13:04.688 --> 13:07.237
We found the pregnancy test
in a bag of trash fries,

13:07.257 --> 13:10.040
which also tested
positive... for flavor.

13:10.060 --> 13:11.927
[Sighs]

13:14.264 --> 13:16.313
This seat taken?

13:16.333 --> 13:18.816
No, but it's sticky.

13:18.836 --> 13:20.618
I deserve it.

13:20.638 --> 13:21.518
Oh!

13:21.538 --> 13:24.388
You weren't kidding. I am planted.

13:24.408 --> 13:27.925
Look, buddy, if we're moving
too fast, I can pump the brakes.

13:27.945 --> 13:30.552
I think I just got so
excited to get your blessing,

13:30.573 --> 13:32.496
I didn't think it through.

13:32.516 --> 13:33.764
But now I get it.

13:33.784 --> 13:36.767
I'm not just marrying Eileen.
I'm marrying all of you.

13:36.787 --> 13:39.536
I understand if you don't want
me living in the back yard.

13:39.556 --> 13:41.805
Are you kidding me? Of
course I want you there.

13:41.825 --> 13:44.008
I just assumed you'd
want to go somewhere else

13:44.028 --> 13:45.560
'cause that's the normal thing to do.

13:45.581 --> 13:47.578
But nothing about this is normal,

13:47.598 --> 13:49.980
yet somehow we make it work.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.182
So, you're okay if I
stay in the tiny house?

13:52.202 --> 13:55.085
Absolutely. I would be ecstatic.

13:55.105 --> 13:56.620
I can't be the man I want to be

13:56.640 --> 13:58.707
without this guy right
outside my back door.

14:00.427 --> 14:05.429
Ladies, I beg you, live your lives!

14:05.449 --> 14:07.564
You know?

14:07.585 --> 14:10.335
Uh, so this is a pamphlet

14:10.354 --> 14:13.170
explaining that being
gay is not a choice,

14:13.190 --> 14:15.581
and here's one that will maybe help

14:15.601 --> 14:19.143
the two of you understand
what Allison is going through.

14:19.163 --> 14:20.619
Uh, now this pamphlet

14:20.639 --> 14:23.989
is for a sale at the J.Crew outlet,

14:24.009 --> 14:25.249
uh, which could be yours

14:25.269 --> 14:27.718
for the small price of
accepting your daughter.

14:27.738 --> 14:29.520
Kenny, we don't need your pamphlets.

14:29.540 --> 14:31.689
We have a plan that
will bring Allison home.

14:31.709 --> 14:33.190
You do?

14:33.210 --> 14:34.958
Okay. That's... That's great.

14:34.978 --> 14:37.528
She must agree to see
our church's counselor

14:37.548 --> 14:39.396
once a week to fix her problem.

14:39.416 --> 14:42.099
See, I told you they wouldn't listen.

14:42.119 --> 14:45.936
Yeah, that's the thing... Um,
she doesn't have a problem.

14:45.956 --> 14:50.649
It's just who she is,
and she is amazing.

14:50.669 --> 14:51.575
Trust me.

14:51.595 --> 14:53.777
Kenny, why should we trust a boy

14:53.797 --> 14:56.313
who lured her into his deviant club?

14:56.333 --> 15:00.114
My club is not deviant.
We do community outreach.

15:00.135 --> 15:02.380
Chess Club got kicked
out of the Ramada Inn.

15:02.401 --> 15:05.522
You're a bad influence, and
this conversation is over.

15:05.542 --> 15:06.323
Excuse me.

15:06.343 --> 15:07.424
[Clears throat]

15:07.444 --> 15:08.826
I'm sorry to interrupt.

15:08.846 --> 15:10.627
I'm Eileen, Kenny's mother.

15:10.647 --> 15:13.831
I never want to interfere,
but I just couldn't sit here,

15:13.851 --> 15:16.166
and I'm... I'm done with my pie.

15:16.186 --> 15:18.857
But your plan isn't going to work

15:18.878 --> 15:21.161
because there's nothing to fix.

15:21.182 --> 15:22.463
Believe me, I've tried.

15:22.484 --> 15:25.033
You can quote the Bible,
and you can throw away

15:25.054 --> 15:27.315
their playbill from "A Chorus Line,"

15:27.336 --> 15:29.346
but nothing you do is
gonna make them not gay.

15:29.366 --> 15:31.108
I knew I didn't lose that playbill.

15:31.129 --> 15:32.816
We're not gonna put aside our beliefs

15:32.836 --> 15:33.951
and let her ruin her life.

15:33.971 --> 15:36.381
It's time for tough love.

15:36.402 --> 15:37.620
Oh.

15:37.641 --> 15:38.722
Oh, well...

15:38.742 --> 15:42.426
Kicking your kid out
of the house isn't love.

15:42.446 --> 15:44.495
And the only one it's
gonna be tough on is you

15:44.515 --> 15:45.729
because you won't have a relationship

15:45.749 --> 15:47.030
with your daughter.

15:47.050 --> 15:51.353
So, maybe just take a
second look at those beliefs.

15:53.442 --> 15:55.791
Allison will stay with us

15:55.812 --> 15:59.547
until, you know, you fix your problem.

16:00.430 --> 16:02.179
Okay.

16:02.199 --> 16:03.180
That's our pie.

16:03.200 --> 16:05.983
Yes, but she eats an enormous amount.

16:06.003 --> 16:07.684
I think it's only fair.

16:07.704 --> 16:09.404
Come on, honey. Let's go.

16:15.579 --> 16:16.693
Okay, here we are.

16:16.713 --> 16:18.061
Oh, good. You guys are here.

16:18.081 --> 16:19.429
Trash fries are still fries.

16:19.449 --> 16:21.765
Everybody, family meeting
in the living room, please.

16:21.785 --> 16:23.167
Everybody in the living room.

16:23.187 --> 16:24.099
Go ahead.

16:26.690 --> 16:27.905
- What's going on?
- Hang on.

16:27.925 --> 16:29.540
Don't worry about it. Just have a seat.

16:29.560 --> 16:31.508
Well, not all of our family is here yet.

16:31.528 --> 16:32.643
Okay.

16:32.663 --> 16:35.427
Clive has something
he would like to say.

16:39.303 --> 16:40.384
O'Neals.

16:40.404 --> 16:43.554
And Allison, who's here for some reason.

16:43.575 --> 16:48.404
Um, after living under
Mother's thumb for so long,

16:48.425 --> 16:52.599
being with all of you has
felt like joining the circus.

16:52.620 --> 16:54.665
Shannon, you're the ringmaster.

16:54.685 --> 16:56.600
Jimmy, you're the clown.

16:56.620 --> 16:58.769
Pat, you're the lion and the lion tamer.

16:58.789 --> 17:00.871
Jodi, you're tickets and promotions.

17:00.891 --> 17:03.807
And, Kenny, of course
you are the bearded lady.

17:03.827 --> 17:05.709
That is offensive, but, honestly,

17:05.729 --> 17:08.078
just glad not to be
tickets and promotions.

17:08.098 --> 17:11.982
And, Eileen, you are
the incredible acrobat.

17:12.002 --> 17:15.484
Elegant and strong, yet flexible.

17:15.505 --> 17:16.520
Hey, now.

17:16.540 --> 17:19.130
In the way that you are able to adapt

17:19.151 --> 17:23.827
to new circumstances gracefully
and without fear of failing.

17:23.847 --> 17:28.198
Uh, so, just indulge me this
circus metaphor a moment longer

17:28.218 --> 17:35.606
to say that I would like to run
away with all of you forever.

17:35.626 --> 17:37.025
So...

17:38.194 --> 17:39.376
[Gasps]

17:39.396 --> 17:41.930
Eileen O'Neal, and family...

17:43.653 --> 17:45.053
Oh, my God.

17:47.371 --> 17:49.419
...will you marry me?

17:49.439 --> 17:53.457
Oh, Clive, it's beautiful.

17:53.477 --> 17:54.491
I tried it on myself.

17:54.511 --> 17:56.260
It was a little loose
on my dainty fingers,

17:56.280 --> 17:57.661
so it should fit you just fine.

17:57.681 --> 18:00.448
That was the loveliest proposal.

18:02.417 --> 18:04.032
But no thank you.

18:04.053 --> 18:05.235
Pat: Wait, what?

18:05.255 --> 18:07.671
Eileen, that was perfect. He
just hit it out of the park.

18:07.691 --> 18:10.574
He did, but I don't want
to get married again.

18:10.594 --> 18:12.776
At least not right now.

18:12.796 --> 18:18.081
For so long I've been worried
about doing the right thing

18:18.101 --> 18:20.582
and what other people think.

18:20.603 --> 18:24.487
I've lived by those rules
and look where it's gotten me.

18:24.508 --> 18:25.522
No offense, Pat.

18:25.542 --> 18:26.490
Ah, that's okay.

18:26.510 --> 18:27.557
I live in your garage. I get it.

18:27.577 --> 18:29.017
Well, it's a tiny house.

18:29.038 --> 18:32.856
I love you, but I'm
on a new adventure now,

18:32.877 --> 18:35.192
and it's not one I've chosen,

18:35.213 --> 18:37.501
but I want to see where it takes me.

18:37.521 --> 18:39.836
I hope you understand.

18:39.856 --> 18:41.138
You kidding me?

18:41.158 --> 18:42.774
You just told me you loved
me for the first time.

18:42.794 --> 18:44.361
I can live off of that for years.

18:44.381 --> 18:47.444
Also, um, I don't think I'm
ready to leave the Hazelwood.

18:47.464 --> 18:49.980
They just installed
the pickleball court.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.183
Listen, I still consider
this proposal a success, okay?

18:53.203 --> 18:55.686
And there's no reason
to waste champagne.

18:55.706 --> 18:56.987
I would love a drink.

18:57.007 --> 18:59.222
No! Mom, you can't drink.

18:59.242 --> 18:59.966
Why?

18:59.987 --> 19:01.091
'Cause you're pregnant.

19:01.112 --> 19:02.531
What? I am not.

19:02.552 --> 19:04.828
I'm just a little
full from all that pie.

19:04.848 --> 19:05.762
Geez.

19:05.782 --> 19:07.130
What? [Scoffs]

19:07.150 --> 19:08.765
So, wait. Then who is?

19:08.785 --> 19:11.138
Jimmy, why does somebody
have to be pregnant?

19:15.525 --> 19:17.274
Fine. It's me.

19:17.294 --> 19:18.976
I'm pregnant.

19:18.996 --> 19:20.243
- [Gasps]
- What?

19:20.263 --> 19:21.113
What?

19:21.134 --> 19:23.246
- Uncle Dwayne?
- Yes.

19:23.266 --> 19:24.848
It happened when you
locked us in your room

19:24.868 --> 19:25.981
and you played The Cranberries.

19:26.001 --> 19:29.152
Who were responsible for many
unplanned pregnancies in 90s.

19:29.172 --> 19:32.789
Wow! Well, I am super happy for you.

19:32.809 --> 19:34.291
But I need a new bed.

19:34.311 --> 19:35.792
Wait, so you're knocked up?

19:35.812 --> 19:38.480
Then how is she gonna take
care of tickets and promotions?

19:38.501 --> 19:39.870
Oh, Jimmy.

19:41.350 --> 19:43.001
Yeah!

19:43.021 --> 19:46.212
<i>Kenny: A lot can happen
to a family in one year.</i>

19:46.232 --> 19:49.349
<i>People can get divorced
but still grow closer,</i>

19:49.369 --> 19:51.918
<i>they can find what makes them happy,</i>

19:51.938 --> 19:53.853
<i>even if it's weird,</i>

19:53.873 --> 19:57.782
<i>they can find joy in completely
unexpected moments,</i>

19:57.802 --> 20:00.829
<i>and they can stand up
for what they believe in,</i>

20:00.850 --> 20:02.262
<i>even if its scary.</i>

20:02.282 --> 20:04.622
Kenny: "From the
outside, you might think

20:04.642 --> 20:07.492
all these changes would
make me want to go to college

20:07.512 --> 20:09.535
as far away from home as possible,

20:09.555 --> 20:10.937
where I can do keg stands

20:10.957 --> 20:13.507
and paint my belly at football games.

20:13.528 --> 20:17.143
But it actually makes me
want to stay close to home

20:17.163 --> 20:19.545
and paint 'O'Neal' on my belly,

20:19.565 --> 20:22.782
because we've become my favorite team."

20:22.802 --> 20:25.881
Jimmy, this is a really good essay.

20:25.902 --> 20:27.320
Thanks.

20:27.340 --> 20:28.702
It's all right.

20:28.723 --> 20:30.694
You're gonna go, aren't you?

20:30.715 --> 20:32.530
I don't know. It's expensive.

20:32.551 --> 20:34.994
And, plus, it's... it's far from here.

20:35.014 --> 20:38.431
I don't know if I'm done
with you all yet, so...

20:38.451 --> 20:39.780
Well, go.

20:39.801 --> 20:41.834
Or stay. I don't care.

20:41.854 --> 20:42.965
You care.

20:42.986 --> 20:44.301
You care, bitch.

20:44.322 --> 20:46.239
Well, um, Kenny, can you do me a favor?

20:46.259 --> 20:48.508
Hold her down, 'cause I'm gonna hug her.

20:48.528 --> 20:49.275
- No.
- Yes.

20:49.295 --> 20:50.109
No, you're not.

20:50.129 --> 20:51.110
- Oh, it's coming.
- No!

20:51.130 --> 20:52.812
It's happening. It's happening!

20:52.832 --> 20:54.113
Come here! Come here!

20:54.133 --> 20:55.114
Yeah!

20:55.134 --> 20:56.482
Peanut brother sandwich!

20:56.502 --> 20:59.552
Both: Peanut brother sandwich!
Peanut brother sandwich!
