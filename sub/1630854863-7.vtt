WEBVTT

00:12.562 --> 00:14.253
There was always
the corruption.

00:14.253 --> 00:17.567
But now the cops, they are
working with drug dealers,

00:17.567 --> 00:20.121
and because of these cops,
my Kings Cross is dying.

00:20.121 --> 00:20.915
Hey Nasa!

00:22.917 --> 00:24.056
We're being watched,

00:24.056 --> 00:25.264
and you keep going
the way you're going,

00:25.264 --> 00:26.748
you're going to fuck up
everything that we have built.

00:26.748 --> 00:27.715
We've!?

00:28.095 --> 00:30.062
Do you actually not see
it or you just too fucking
high?

00:30.960 --> 00:33.238
Sammy's here!

00:33.376 --> 00:34.480
What are you doing?

00:34.480 --> 00:35.757
We used to laugh at
clowns like this.

00:35.757 --> 00:36.931
Now you're one of them?

00:40.590 --> 00:42.316
I can't believe
you fucking shot him.

00:42.316 --> 00:43.627
What the fuck was
I supposed to do?

00:43.627 --> 00:44.766
We're fucked!
Do you know that?

00:44.766 --> 00:45.767
Fuck!

00:45.767 --> 00:46.907
We're going
to come after you.

00:46.907 --> 00:47.838
All of you.

01:01.680 --> 01:03.406
CBD Drug Squad,
my friend.

01:03.406 --> 01:04.683
Hands behind your back.

01:04.683 --> 01:06.167
- For fucking what?
- It's for distribution

01:06.167 --> 01:08.238
and facilitation of a
commercial amount of cocaine.

02:25.971 --> 02:27.007
You'll get better.

03:21.199 --> 03:22.234
So, how's he doing?

03:23.166 --> 03:26.687
He rolls, shakes, he can
barely lift a finger.

03:27.101 --> 03:28.482
- Are you on his pod?
- Yeah.

03:29.655 --> 03:32.175
Here is the phone number.
Clean cell!

03:32.175 --> 03:34.591
On there is a list of people
I do not want visiting.

03:35.316 --> 03:36.386
Well how long's he in for?

03:37.318 --> 03:39.700
15 years, if he doesn't
win the case.

03:39.907 --> 03:42.254
- Hey, we good?
- Yep.

03:45.361 --> 03:46.983
Okay, everybody listen up.

03:49.330 --> 03:51.125
As of today,

03:51.125 --> 03:54.887
the Commission has authorised
us to offer indemnity.

03:57.131 --> 04:00.203
Now, we're going to
use it three ways.

04:00.203 --> 04:02.412
First, we want to chase
after the dealers

04:02.412 --> 04:04.621
who don't really have
anyone in their corner.

04:04.621 --> 04:05.829
They'll be desperate,

04:05.829 --> 04:08.729
which means they're the
most likely to wire up.

04:08.729 --> 04:10.765
Then we want to go
after the little fish,

04:10.765 --> 04:13.423
not the major players,
but close enough to them.

04:14.148 --> 04:17.738
We flip 'em and get them to
roll on their bosses,

04:17.738 --> 04:19.671
and finally these pricks.

04:20.810 --> 04:23.123
Find the cops who are
shitting themselves.

04:23.123 --> 04:24.883
Find something to pin on them,

04:24.883 --> 04:27.403
and the odds are, if you
offer them indemnity,

04:27.403 --> 04:29.543
they'll be working
for us pretty quickly.

04:29.543 --> 04:32.339
But be prudent, the threat
of these bastards rolling

04:32.339 --> 04:35.065
on each other will be
enough to spook the pricks.

04:35.065 --> 04:36.964
And that's when we
catch them slipping up.

04:39.932 --> 04:42.487
So if you work for the
cops you get no prison time?

04:42.487 --> 04:44.523
Yeah, that's
what they told me.

04:44.523 --> 04:45.938
What the fuck's
double indemnity?

04:45.938 --> 04:48.251
I dunno. Pretty sure
it's a movie.

04:48.251 --> 04:50.322
I think my nan's
got it on VHS.

04:50.771 --> 04:53.083
I've been meaning
to ask you about your nan.

04:53.774 --> 04:54.878
How is she?

04:54.878 --> 04:56.259
Yeah, she's all right man.

04:56.259 --> 04:57.536
- She's asking after you.
- Really?

04:57.536 --> 05:00.056
Yeah, she's in a home now
though, man. Maximum security.

05:00.056 --> 05:00.712
Well you never know.

05:01.161 --> 05:02.541
You know, those places are
pretty fucking wild.

05:02.541 --> 05:05.268
Hey, that's my nan.
Watch yourself.

05:05.268 --> 05:06.442
All right. Hey, do you want
to get some Chinese?

05:06.442 --> 05:07.305
Let's get some food.

05:07.305 --> 05:08.927
- Nah.
- Come on, Chinese!

05:08.927 --> 05:11.688
Bro, no way. The boys went
down to Grandview earlier.

05:11.688 --> 05:14.726
Now they're crook as. Dodgy
satay chicken they reckon.

05:14.726 --> 05:16.935
- What?
- The boys are sick.

05:16.935 --> 05:18.488
- All of them?
- Yeah.

05:18.488 --> 05:19.765
Mullet!

05:19.765 --> 05:22.906
It's fucking Friday night.
Who's packing up the rack?

05:22.906 --> 05:24.494
I don't know mate.
It's not my fucking job.

05:24.494 --> 05:25.530
We've gotta get the fucking
shit on the street.

05:25.737 --> 05:27.152
What do you want me to do man?
I can't pack it myself.

05:27.152 --> 05:30.707
Listen, I'm going to
help you pack, this once.

05:30.707 --> 05:33.158
Give me two shakes. I'm
going to go and speak to John.

05:33.296 --> 05:34.677
- Fuck off.
- Now?

05:34.677 --> 05:35.988
- Yes.
- Okay.

05:36.748 --> 05:39.026
We'll be willing to talk
about some potential business.

05:39.026 --> 05:41.166
I appreciate
your enthusiasm,

05:41.166 --> 05:42.478
but I have some hesitation.

05:42.478 --> 05:44.756
Well this is an offer,
it's not a negotiation.

05:44.756 --> 05:45.757
We have a distributor.

05:45.757 --> 05:48.518
Joey Romano,
is no distributor.

05:48.518 --> 05:50.693
He's a fool who stepped
into the right place

05:50.693 --> 05:52.004
at the right time.

05:52.004 --> 05:54.800
I have the manpower.
You've seen it.

05:54.800 --> 05:55.836
So has Joey.

05:56.112 --> 05:58.252
I really want to
do business, but my supplier

05:58.252 --> 06:00.530
won't have Sam Ibrahim
stealing his fire.

06:00.530 --> 06:01.462
Sam's in jail.

06:01.669 --> 06:04.707
Sam's in remand and I
don't want him coming out.

06:04.707 --> 06:06.018
Neither do you.

06:06.018 --> 06:09.159
I'm not Joey.
I can fix the problem.

06:09.159 --> 06:10.471
What! Permanently?

06:10.471 --> 06:14.234
No better way to
kill an animal than in the cage.

06:46.611 --> 06:47.853
Oi, Gary!

06:47.853 --> 06:51.167
When we getting some new
radios in the fucking shop.

06:51.167 --> 06:53.169
I would've thought the
voices in your head,

06:53.169 --> 06:54.274
were entertaining enough, Henry.

06:54.274 --> 06:56.206
No, I know. I'm listening
to them right now Gary,

06:56.206 --> 06:57.932
and they're telling you
to suck me off.

07:09.358 --> 07:10.842
No fucking way!

07:13.154 --> 07:14.639
Sammy boy!

07:16.226 --> 07:17.607
You don't remember me,
do you?

07:17.607 --> 07:19.575
Am I meant to?

07:20.955 --> 07:22.578
Ran some doors down the Cross.

07:23.303 --> 07:25.408
Your brother helped me out
once or twice.

07:25.408 --> 07:27.686
Lent me some cash
when I was in a hole.

07:29.170 --> 07:30.448
Smoke?

07:40.078 --> 07:42.045
It's Doids, by the way.

09:00.020 --> 09:01.780
You want a steak Johnny?

09:02.471 --> 09:04.438
Nah, I'm all good Tony. Thanks.

09:07.372 --> 09:09.167
So are we going to talk
about this thing?

09:10.340 --> 09:11.583
Which thing?

09:11.894 --> 09:13.413
You putting Sam in prison.

09:13.792 --> 09:15.484
Got nothing to do with me.

09:20.834 --> 09:23.284
Shouldn't be a problem
if I got him out then?

09:23.457 --> 09:25.286
Nah.

09:27.461 --> 09:29.463
Anyway, except then,
you know, we'd end up

09:29.463 --> 09:31.396
with the same problem
we had before.

09:37.402 --> 09:39.956
If there is a problem with my
brother, I'll deal with it.

09:41.061 --> 09:43.891
- Not you.
- Okay.

09:44.685 --> 09:46.100
Okay.

09:46.929 --> 09:48.551
You sure you don't want
something to eat?

09:49.414 --> 09:50.967
No thanks, Tony.

09:51.692 --> 09:53.729
- Thanks.
- All right mate.

10:02.565 --> 10:04.567
No one's listening.
System's down.

10:04.567 --> 10:05.879
Thanks Gary.

10:13.300 --> 10:15.820
- Suits you
- Suits me, huh.

10:15.820 --> 10:18.650
Do your girlfriends make you
put these on, you sick fuck.

10:18.650 --> 10:20.272
Yeah, but they're
usually furry.

10:20.272 --> 10:21.688
Fucking weirdo.

10:21.688 --> 10:23.068
You look like shit.

10:23.068 --> 10:24.967
Yeah, well you were always
the pretty one.

10:24.967 --> 10:26.244
I like your new digs.

10:26.244 --> 10:27.176
Hey, are you going
to be this annoying

10:27.176 --> 10:28.488
every time you come visit?

10:28.488 --> 10:30.386
- Maybe.
- Don't come then.

10:41.915 --> 10:44.434
- You doing okay?
- I'm doing okay.

10:44.434 --> 10:45.815
I need you to get
me out of here.

10:46.885 --> 10:47.852
I will.

10:48.956 --> 10:50.889
Well how long
is it going to take?

10:51.718 --> 10:54.479
- That depends.
- It depends on what?

10:54.479 --> 10:56.481
It depends on a
lot of things.

11:05.490 --> 11:07.872
Yo, I'm going to need you
to arrange something for me.

11:15.845 --> 11:18.607
Fuck's sake.

11:19.608 --> 11:21.644
I need you to
gimme some coke.

11:22.300 --> 11:23.853
I'm not going to do that.

11:25.717 --> 11:28.202
Well then I need you to stop
fucking with my visit list.

11:28.202 --> 11:29.203
I'm not going to do
that either, Sam.

11:29.203 --> 11:31.309
Oh you fucking little shit!

11:32.379 --> 11:33.794
After everything I
fucking done for you.

11:33.794 --> 11:35.347
You fucking can't do me
one fucking favour!

11:35.347 --> 11:37.315
I am doing you a favour.

11:38.627 --> 11:41.215
I am doing you a favour.

11:46.082 --> 11:48.050
I will work on
getting you out.

11:50.293 --> 11:52.744
You work on getting
yourself clean.

12:04.929 --> 12:08.380
Yeah. All right.
Well I'll talk to the lawyers.

12:09.312 --> 12:10.935
Yep. All right.

12:13.523 --> 12:16.457
- Where'd you get that?
- What, this?

12:16.457 --> 12:17.458
Yeah, the phone.

12:17.458 --> 12:18.425
No, no, no.
It's not just a phone.

12:18.425 --> 12:19.944
It's a flip phone.

12:19.944 --> 12:21.773
Yeah, state of the art.
You can't afford it.

12:21.773 --> 12:23.085
It's too small, John.

12:23.085 --> 12:24.500
Too small?

12:24.500 --> 12:25.605
No, it's supposed to be small,

12:25.605 --> 12:27.227
so it fits right
in your pocket.

12:27.227 --> 12:28.711
But you forget about
it in your pocket.

12:28.711 --> 12:30.368
It end up in the
washing machine.

12:30.368 --> 12:32.128
- It's too small.
- It's not too small.

12:32.128 --> 12:35.373
Hey Jackal!
Too small or average?

12:35.373 --> 12:37.513
- Hey John!
- What?

12:41.068 --> 12:42.207
Two ladies!

12:42.207 --> 12:43.070
You looking for
a good night out?

12:43.070 --> 12:45.038
Always,
you know any good venues?

12:45.038 --> 12:46.349
I do.

12:46.349 --> 12:48.317
Remember all those
cars coming to a stop

12:48.317 --> 12:49.939
in the middle of the
road the other night?

12:51.976 --> 12:53.218
It looked like they
got a guard of honour

12:53.218 --> 12:54.495
from you and your brother.

12:54.495 --> 12:56.566
Oh, is it illegal to
stand in the street now?

12:57.775 --> 12:58.776
We'd be fucked.

12:58.776 --> 13:01.502
A Vietnamese heavy
was shot dead

13:01.502 --> 13:04.747
out at Cabramatta hours before
those cars came through here.

13:04.747 --> 13:06.611
Cocaine robbery gone wrong.

13:06.611 --> 13:08.820
So yeah, if you had
anything to do with that

13:08.820 --> 13:10.995
you would be really fucked.

13:11.823 --> 13:13.514
Oh, it's a good thing I've
got nothing to do with it.

13:13.514 --> 13:14.654
Didn't your brother
just get arrested

13:14.654 --> 13:17.795
for conspiracy to facilitate
cocaine distribution?

13:17.795 --> 13:19.348
Is that what the shooting was?

13:19.348 --> 13:21.074
Sam trying to take
out the competition?

13:21.074 --> 13:23.283
Like I said,
I don't talk to cops.

13:23.283 --> 13:24.733
Then talk to Sam.

13:24.733 --> 13:25.975
It'll go easier for him

13:25.975 --> 13:30.221
if he raises his hand now,
rather than Wade or us prove it.

13:31.084 --> 13:32.119
That's not going to happen.

13:34.156 --> 13:36.089
Hey, you sure you don't
want to come in for a drink?

13:37.090 --> 13:39.333
No? Some other time
then Officer.

13:39.333 --> 13:41.094
He's never going to
give us anything.

13:41.094 --> 13:43.303
He was raised by these guys.
He's old school.

13:43.303 --> 13:44.718
Sorry about the wait.

14:12.953 --> 14:14.437
Buy you a drink?

14:16.992 --> 14:18.752
Cops are asking about
the shooting.

14:20.374 --> 14:21.790
They came to the fucking door.

14:22.238 --> 14:23.619
Does John know anything?

14:24.068 --> 14:25.897
- Nope.
- You sure?

14:26.691 --> 14:29.487
Those gooks won't stop until
they find out who did it.

14:29.487 --> 14:31.454
Yeah, that's why I've
been looking for you,

14:31.454 --> 14:33.387
and you just fucked off,
didn't ya?

14:42.672 --> 14:44.813
Maybe you should ask
John for some time off.

14:50.232 --> 14:52.855
You're a little
too easy to find.

15:05.385 --> 15:07.628
Hey Sweeney,
the Bears got up mate.

15:07.628 --> 15:09.354
Ha! Yeah,
it was a good win.

15:10.114 --> 15:11.356
Shut the door.

15:16.499 --> 15:18.743
We agreed. All right?

15:18.743 --> 15:20.503
So what part of keeping
our heads down,

15:20.503 --> 15:22.367
and taking a pay cut,
wasn't clear to you?

15:22.367 --> 15:23.437
Ah, mate.

15:23.437 --> 15:24.542
Don't worry about it.
It's all good.

15:24.680 --> 15:27.752
The Commission already knows
you and I are on the take.

15:27.752 --> 15:30.859
Doyle and O'Neill came by my
fucking house this morning,

15:30.859 --> 15:33.275
in front of my daughter
to tell me that,

15:33.275 --> 15:34.621
and that they're
going to prove it,

15:34.621 --> 15:36.830
and here you are
still collecting.

15:38.487 --> 15:43.699
Everyone, has to hold the line
because they get one of us,

15:43.699 --> 15:45.770
they get all of us.

15:45.770 --> 15:48.738
Okay? Fucking can it.

15:48.738 --> 15:51.155
Okay, I'll can it.
I'll can it.

15:51.672 --> 15:53.329
I'll can it!

15:53.329 --> 15:55.573
- Morning dickheads.
- Hey Thommo.

15:55.573 --> 15:57.678
Jeez, you really are cutting
down on the pies mate.

15:57.678 --> 15:59.715
- Hey, get fucked.
- How's the physio going?

15:59.715 --> 16:01.786
Yeah, good mate.
I'm getting there.

16:01.786 --> 16:03.753
Hey, a couple of boys I know

16:03.753 --> 16:05.065
have picked up on
a bit of chatter.

16:05.065 --> 16:06.239
Yeah?

16:06.239 --> 16:08.482
There's a contract out
on that Ibrahim prick in jail.

16:08.689 --> 16:10.484
- Who took it out?
- I dunno.

16:10.484 --> 16:13.487
- I'll keep you posted.
- Yeah do, thanks.

16:13.487 --> 16:14.868
- Hooroo.
- Hooroo.

16:14.868 --> 16:16.387
Thanks mate.

16:23.946 --> 16:25.051
I've told you
before Gary,

16:25.051 --> 16:26.362
the food here's no
good for me guts.

16:26.362 --> 16:27.329
I'm all clogged up.

16:27.329 --> 16:28.571
Yeah, I'll pass it on
to the infirmary.

16:28.571 --> 16:30.125
They'll get you
some laxatives.

16:30.125 --> 16:30.919
I appreciate it Gary.

16:31.471 --> 16:32.713
I thought for a second you
might have to put a finger up there.

16:32.713 --> 16:34.474
Nah.

16:45.278 --> 16:46.624
Excuse me.

16:57.186 --> 16:59.292
Hey bro. Take mine.

17:32.566 --> 17:35.707
Hey, spilled your lunch.

17:39.780 --> 17:42.128
Your body's hungry,
even if you are not.

17:42.128 --> 17:44.164
I've done withdrawals myself.

17:53.933 --> 17:55.486
Clarky.

17:58.868 --> 18:00.698
What's that cock in for?

18:05.254 --> 18:07.808
Murder. Plenty of us in here.

18:08.775 --> 18:10.018
You?

18:11.226 --> 18:13.331
This and that,
you know?

18:47.883 --> 18:49.850
Oh, fuck!

18:58.204 --> 18:59.722
Indemnity, hey?

18:59.722 --> 19:01.276
The office
doesn't feel the same,

19:01.276 --> 19:03.140
like the whole
station is spooked.

19:03.140 --> 19:03.933
Ahh...

19:03.933 --> 19:06.488
- And they should be.
- Oh yeah.

19:07.040 --> 19:08.179
Mate, it's serious.

19:09.353 --> 19:11.320
Is this something
I should know?

19:12.287 --> 19:13.633
We need to be very careful,

19:13.633 --> 19:15.773
because these guys know
what they're doing,

19:15.773 --> 19:17.050
and they're not
fucking around.

19:17.050 --> 19:18.948
All right.
Should we get a taxi?

19:18.948 --> 19:20.260
No, no.
I'm almost done.

19:20.260 --> 19:22.607
Seriously, 'cause Yael is
going to fucking kill me.

19:22.607 --> 19:24.713
- Hey mate, we're nearly done.
- All right.

19:25.955 --> 19:28.613
So you know anything about
this contract on Sam?

19:29.269 --> 19:30.753
Nah.

19:35.344 --> 19:36.863
All right, I'll see you soon.

19:36.863 --> 19:38.899
See ya. All right.

19:44.388 --> 19:46.528
The Ibrahims, they're
our people Ezra.

19:46.528 --> 19:47.874
Yeah, so was Nasa.

19:47.874 --> 19:49.531
Yeah, all I'm saying,
if it fucking gets out,

19:49.531 --> 19:51.119
- it's not a good look.
- All right.

19:56.538 --> 19:58.436
Come on. Come on.

20:00.162 --> 20:01.405
Pigs.

20:01.405 --> 20:03.165
Fuck off.

20:05.305 --> 20:09.344
Jesus.
Man-o-man. Fuck!

20:12.174 --> 20:14.349
It's not that big
a deal. We sometimes get...

20:14.349 --> 20:15.729
Johnny, listen, hey...

20:15.729 --> 20:18.560
The street's gone to shit
without Sam.

20:18.560 --> 20:21.010
I mean, these rats used
to be afraid of something,

20:21.010 --> 20:21.908
well, one thing.

20:22.150 --> 20:24.600
Your brother's just not
a pretty face, you know?

20:24.600 --> 20:27.293
Look, I'm protecting the
clubs only under our bat.

20:27.293 --> 20:28.604
That's all I'm
interested in at the moment.

20:28.604 --> 20:30.606
And, fuck policing
the streets for Joey,

20:30.606 --> 20:31.504
or for anyone else.

20:31.504 --> 20:32.401
- Fuck Joey.
- Yeah?

20:32.401 --> 20:33.816
Well what if the Viets
roll back in?

20:33.816 --> 20:36.233
You start caring about
the street then?

20:36.233 --> 20:39.201
Who said you can drop
it to ten fucking bucks?

20:39.201 --> 20:41.065
- Fuck you!
- Fuck off!

20:41.065 --> 20:43.447
Look, I'm trying
to avoid bloodshed.

20:43.447 --> 20:45.828
As long as the venues are safe,
that's all that matters.

20:45.828 --> 20:48.348
I heard they're looking for
one of the Black Flags.

20:48.348 --> 20:49.798
Does that mean
Sam these days?

20:49.798 --> 20:50.868
Yeah, I heard that too.

20:50.868 --> 20:52.421
What the fuck's
going on over there?

20:52.421 --> 20:53.388
'Love Machine'.

20:53.491 --> 20:55.148
They're undercutting
their door prices again.

20:55.148 --> 20:56.045
It's a slow night.

20:56.045 --> 20:57.702
What are we supposed to do?

20:57.702 --> 20:59.394
Who told you to do that?

20:59.394 --> 21:00.326
The boss.

21:03.225 --> 21:04.468
Door price is 25 dollars.

21:04.468 --> 21:06.366
You go tell your boss no
more spruikers this weekend.

21:06.366 --> 21:07.540
Jesus Christ, John, come on.

21:07.540 --> 21:09.024
Listen, don't gimme that.
It's not your fault.

21:09.024 --> 21:10.922
Just go find another
door to work.

21:11.923 --> 21:12.855
Off you go.

21:16.342 --> 21:17.205
Good job, John.

21:17.205 --> 21:18.689
Piss off!

21:30.010 --> 21:32.392
I just finished
speaking to him, hey.

21:32.392 --> 21:33.221
What were they after?

21:33.221 --> 21:35.015
Anything about you.

21:35.015 --> 21:37.190
You should have told them
he does his eyebrows.

21:37.190 --> 21:39.606
Hey. The fuck
I do my eyebrows.

21:39.606 --> 21:41.539
They offer you
indemnity as well?

21:41.539 --> 21:43.092
Yes, they just
about to offer me

21:43.092 --> 21:44.922
my fucking island
in Tonga.

21:44.922 --> 21:46.337
Fucking idiot!

21:46.337 --> 21:47.821
They asked me
to wire up. Hey!

21:49.444 --> 21:50.514
Did they?

21:52.826 --> 21:53.827
A wire?

21:57.037 --> 21:58.453
Oh, fuck off!

22:00.317 --> 22:01.076
Go on, then.

22:09.084 --> 22:10.499
Take your fucking pants off.

22:17.334 --> 22:18.680
Happy now?

22:20.268 --> 22:22.270
What, is it
cold in here?

22:22.270 --> 22:25.169
Put your fucking pants on,
you poofter.

22:25.583 --> 22:27.067
This shit is serious.

22:27.896 --> 22:29.587
You think everyone else
is saying no to this?

22:29.587 --> 22:30.830
Is there someone
you're sus on?

22:30.830 --> 22:31.693
Joey, maybe.

22:32.797 --> 22:34.143
He was pretty weird
the other night.

22:34.143 --> 22:35.179
Asking a lot of questions,

22:35.179 --> 22:37.043
and wanted me to
protect his dealers.

22:38.527 --> 22:40.184
All right. From now on,
outside of us four,

22:40.184 --> 22:42.290
we assume that everyone
is wearing a wire.

22:43.256 --> 22:46.570
Dogs aren't waiting for the
moment where we slip up anymore.

22:46.570 --> 22:48.261
They're going
to make it happen.

23:01.619 --> 23:02.551
I never thought I'd say this,

23:02.551 --> 23:03.794
but I'm starting to miss
your brother.

23:03.794 --> 23:04.933
It's fucking chaos
out there.

23:04.933 --> 23:06.935
Someone's got to
control this shit, John.

23:11.353 --> 23:12.527
Where you going?

23:15.081 --> 23:17.083
We can talk here.

23:17.083 --> 23:17.946
What?

23:17.946 --> 23:18.947
I said, "We can talk here."

23:18.947 --> 23:20.500
I can't fucking hear you.

23:20.500 --> 23:21.294
My fault, again.

23:21.294 --> 23:22.468
I can't fucking hear you.

23:22.468 --> 23:24.228
Can we go outside
where it's quiet?

23:29.716 --> 23:32.271
You think I'm
wearing a fucking wire?

23:33.375 --> 23:34.997
Hey!

23:34.997 --> 23:37.034
I deserve more
fucking respect than this.

23:37.034 --> 23:38.967
You started this fucking mess.

23:38.967 --> 23:39.795
Me?

23:39.795 --> 23:40.693
Yes, you. We had a system,

23:40.693 --> 23:41.797
until you decided
to blow it up.

23:41.797 --> 23:43.040
A fucking system?

23:43.040 --> 23:44.731
What, Nasa, that prick who
went to the fucking TV,

23:44.731 --> 23:46.664
and dogged everybody?

23:46.664 --> 23:47.493
Listen,

23:47.976 --> 23:50.392
you can't fucking blame me for
the whole enchilada, right?

23:50.392 --> 23:52.049
Nasa made his choices.

23:52.049 --> 23:53.326
So did Sam.

24:19.870 --> 24:21.665
We have to be able
to trust each other.

24:21.665 --> 24:22.493
Yeah, we can.

24:22.493 --> 24:23.356
No, we can't,

24:23.356 --> 24:24.219
because you looked
me in the eye,

24:24.219 --> 24:25.703
and told me you'd
fucking canned it,

24:25.703 --> 24:26.566
and you haven't.

24:26.566 --> 24:27.429
I did.

24:27.533 --> 24:28.948
It's just the last ones
for this week.

24:28.948 --> 24:30.259
I earned that fucking money.

24:30.259 --> 24:31.813
Hey. You are going
to bring us all down.

24:31.813 --> 24:33.435
They're going to
take the house, mate.

24:36.852 --> 24:37.681
Okay.

24:39.303 --> 24:41.409
And Cath's not far behind.

24:44.273 --> 24:45.654
Why didn't you tell me?

24:48.968 --> 24:51.004
'Cause, I just thought
I could sort it.

24:59.737 --> 25:00.635
Fuck.

25:03.085 --> 25:05.122
All right.
We'll figure this out.

25:08.125 --> 25:11.197
Oi, you're not going
to lose your house.

25:13.751 --> 25:15.097
Yeah.

25:17.237 --> 25:18.515
Ah, boys.

25:18.515 --> 25:19.619
I was wondering

25:19.619 --> 25:21.690
if we could borrow
Detective Mooney for a moment.

25:22.622 --> 25:24.659
Come on, you're going to have
to speak at some point, Declan.

25:24.659 --> 25:26.592
You a bit scared mate?

25:27.489 --> 25:29.664
Yeah. Shakin' in my boots.

25:31.148 --> 25:32.563
Well, why don't
you give us a call

25:32.563 --> 25:34.807
when you find a time
that works best for you.

25:35.842 --> 25:36.671
Sure.

26:06.770 --> 26:08.047
Can you hear them, John?

26:10.394 --> 26:11.913
Hear what?

26:11.913 --> 26:13.501
The jungle drums.

26:14.502 --> 26:16.711
They're getting
pretty fucking loud.

26:17.263 --> 26:19.368
Commission's already
speaking to my blokes.

26:20.715 --> 26:21.854
Mine too.

26:25.271 --> 26:26.272
Listen, I know

26:26.410 --> 26:28.447
you're making monthly
payments to Spyro's family,

26:28.447 --> 26:29.827
and, I get it,

26:29.827 --> 26:33.037
but it's not
a good idea, John.

26:40.010 --> 26:42.875
A very good mate of mine
needs some reassurance,

26:44.566 --> 26:45.533
and I have something for you

26:45.533 --> 26:48.052
that I hope might
help me get it.

26:48.984 --> 26:50.710
There's a contract
out on Sam.

26:52.056 --> 26:53.920
And, although I don't
know who's going to do it,

26:53.920 --> 26:55.059
or who's paying for it,

26:55.059 --> 26:57.993
I'm 100 percent certain he's
going to get clipped,

26:59.374 --> 27:01.031
but I can get him out.

27:01.031 --> 27:03.102
Now, I had a look
at the Drug Squad brief.

27:03.102 --> 27:05.311
The whole case hinges on
one witness statement.

27:05.311 --> 27:06.795
A dealer.

27:06.795 --> 27:08.038
I give you his name,

27:08.038 --> 27:09.660
you go and jog his memory,

27:09.660 --> 27:11.006
and all I ask for in return,

27:11.006 --> 27:13.319
is that you extend some of
that generosity of yours

27:13.319 --> 27:14.527
to my mate.

27:18.980 --> 27:21.500
My generosity will be
shown once Sam's out safe.

27:23.191 --> 27:24.192
No worries.

27:24.192 --> 27:25.055
Thank you.

27:25.055 --> 27:25.918
I appreciate it.

27:27.713 --> 27:28.852
What's the name?

27:33.373 --> 27:36.549
Hey, Jimmy!

27:36.549 --> 27:39.448
Where you going, Jim?

27:39.448 --> 27:40.864
Jimmy, my boy.

27:40.864 --> 27:43.107
Where are you going?
Come here for a sec.

27:43.107 --> 27:44.212
Look, I don't have
gear in my pockets.

27:44.212 --> 27:45.627
- I don't want...
- Search me, man.

27:45.627 --> 27:47.836
Mate, it's all right.
Take a breath. Calm down.

27:47.836 --> 27:49.355
We're not going to hurt ya.

27:49.355 --> 27:52.151
Look, we just want have
a chat to you, okay?

27:52.151 --> 27:54.360
So, here's what
you're going to do.

27:54.360 --> 27:56.535
Shit's getting real
on the outside.

27:57.328 --> 27:58.640
Commission's offering deals,

27:58.640 --> 28:00.711
trying to get the
boys to roll on us.

28:01.643 --> 28:04.612
You're about the only
person I can trust anymore.

28:04.612 --> 28:06.027
No one else.

28:06.890 --> 28:07.891
Not really.

28:11.826 --> 28:13.448
Listen, this shit
with the Viets.

28:14.863 --> 28:16.175
What shit with the Viets?

28:17.383 --> 28:19.350
Well fuck...
I didn't do nothing.

28:19.350 --> 28:21.145
Well, it's not me.

28:21.732 --> 28:23.320
Well they seem to think it was.

28:23.320 --> 28:25.046
Commission does too.

28:25.046 --> 28:26.254
What? You talking
to the commission?

28:26.254 --> 28:27.427
No, not yet.

28:27.427 --> 28:29.222
Can't wait, though.

28:30.120 --> 28:32.709
Imagine all the dirty secrets
I could tell them about you.

28:34.952 --> 28:36.264
Ah, fuck off.

28:41.165 --> 28:41.959
What?

28:41.959 --> 28:43.236
God damn it.

28:43.236 --> 28:44.513
Come here.

28:47.102 --> 28:48.276
- Fuck. Ah.
- Tell them that, you fuck.

28:48.276 --> 28:49.795
I'm joking, you
dickhead. I'm joking man.

28:49.795 --> 28:51.037
Look at that.

28:51.037 --> 28:53.833
- You're bleeding...
- Listen here for a second.

28:53.833 --> 28:55.041
Listen to me! Okay?

28:55.041 --> 28:57.078
There's a fucking
contract on your life.

28:59.149 --> 29:00.184
Yeah.

29:03.360 --> 29:04.499
What?

29:04.499 --> 29:06.052
With who, the Viets?

29:06.052 --> 29:07.640
I don't know yet.

29:10.816 --> 29:13.888
Gary's going to drop a phone
into your cell tonight.

29:13.888 --> 29:15.268
Now, I'm still
trying to work out

29:15.268 --> 29:16.338
how to get you out of here,

29:16.338 --> 29:17.650
but in the meantime,
it's not safe.

29:21.896 --> 29:23.552
I'm clean.

29:25.451 --> 29:26.590
It's good.

29:29.110 --> 29:30.629
Let me deal with them.

29:33.355 --> 29:35.081
Got anyone watching
your back in here?

29:36.013 --> 29:38.498
Just fucking Clarky.

29:38.498 --> 29:40.224
He's all right, I guess.

29:41.398 --> 29:43.434
This banana called, 'Doids'.

29:44.228 --> 29:45.782
- Doids?
- Doids. Doids.

29:45.782 --> 29:47.611
Said he knew you,
or some shit.

29:49.371 --> 29:51.546
You know why he's in here?

29:51.546 --> 29:52.858
No.

29:53.203 --> 29:56.516
The dog killed some bloke's
ex-girlfriend for him.

29:57.103 --> 29:58.657
He was paid to do it.

29:59.761 --> 30:03.144
You got a fucking contract
killer in your pod, Sam.

30:21.956 --> 30:24.579

♪ Three dicks in the tub

30:24.579 --> 30:26.857

30:36.177 --> 30:37.799
Oh, do you want to fuck me?

30:41.458 --> 30:43.460
I've got
soap in my eyes.

30:48.361 --> 30:50.156
♪ Oh, rub a dub dub,

30:50.156 --> 30:52.124

31:35.201 --> 31:37.617

amount of cocaine,

31:37.617 --> 31:39.447
that's 10 years.

31:39.447 --> 31:41.242
Yeah, I know you've only
told me 14 million times.

31:41.242 --> 31:42.484
Yeah, 'cause I'm
trying to help you.

31:42.484 --> 31:43.658
The Drug Squad's

31:43.658 --> 31:44.659
not going to give you
a offer as good as this.

31:44.659 --> 31:45.936
This is what indemnity
is all about.

31:45.936 --> 31:47.041
That sounds pretty sweet.

31:47.213 --> 31:48.697
But it kind of makes me wish
I had fucking X-ray vision,

31:48.697 --> 31:50.389
so I could see through balaclavas.

31:54.427 --> 31:56.498
All right, Lukey,
let's hand him over.

31:56.498 --> 31:58.535
- He's got nothing.
- Hold on. Wait, wait, wait.

32:00.640 --> 32:03.264
I might know a few people
with a bit of information.

32:03.264 --> 32:04.886
Okay? I can ask around.

32:27.184 --> 32:29.152
Penny, I got this one.

32:35.675 --> 32:36.469
John.

32:43.062 --> 32:44.961
Let me grab you a drink.

32:44.961 --> 32:46.825
I own the club, fuckwit.

32:46.825 --> 32:48.723
Look bro, I'm not trying
to bother you.

32:48.723 --> 32:49.620
Too late.

32:49.758 --> 32:51.450
I've got something you
might want to know.

32:52.589 --> 32:54.833
John, it's about who shot
that Vietnamese bloke.

32:56.938 --> 32:58.837
I don't know
exactly who it was.

32:58.837 --> 33:00.114
Just that he had a limp.

33:03.496 --> 33:05.844
Dave, get this
guy out of here.

33:06.706 --> 33:08.294
He's had a bit too
much to drink.

33:28.176 --> 33:29.729
Hey, big fella.

33:31.317 --> 33:32.940
Heard you like the
old booger sugar.

33:35.839 --> 33:37.530
No, I heard it's bad
for your teeth.

33:38.152 --> 33:39.774
Hey, fuck off.

33:39.774 --> 33:40.775
Lucky for you.

33:40.775 --> 33:42.915
I've got a
little bit of spare.

33:43.985 --> 33:45.849
Looking to move it before
the guards do a sweep.

33:45.849 --> 33:46.988
On tick.

33:46.988 --> 33:49.749
You just might want to give
that one a rinse first.

33:49.749 --> 33:51.027
300 bucks in my account
by tomorrow,

33:51.027 --> 33:52.649
or I'll break
your fucking legs.

33:54.651 --> 33:55.755
Enjoy.

34:03.384 --> 34:04.488
Henry hook you up too.

34:04.488 --> 34:05.973
It's party time, eh?

34:05.973 --> 34:06.766
Yeah.

34:06.766 --> 34:07.733
Party for one.

34:07.733 --> 34:09.390
Ah, don't be so antisocial.

34:11.392 --> 34:14.222
Got to have friends
in here, pal.

34:18.813 --> 34:20.470
Is that you, is it?

34:21.022 --> 34:22.092
Maybe.

34:59.785 --> 35:01.683
I hear you at night.

35:02.546 --> 35:03.927
Training.

35:06.723 --> 35:07.793
What for?

35:09.760 --> 35:12.004
Hey.

35:12.004 --> 35:13.350
Enough for three?

35:13.350 --> 35:15.180
Fuck off, Doids.

35:15.180 --> 35:16.975
Oh, come on, bro.

35:16.975 --> 35:19.598
Thought we're
going to be besties.

35:20.875 --> 35:22.187
Everything okay in here?

35:26.501 --> 35:27.916
Yeah.

35:27.916 --> 35:29.504
This banana
was just leaving.

35:37.547 --> 35:38.341
Yeah.

35:38.341 --> 35:40.032
Righty-oh.

35:56.807 --> 35:58.292
So tomorrow's
the day, right?

35:59.224 --> 36:01.157
That's what
she told me.

36:01.157 --> 36:02.675
Nice.

36:19.623 --> 36:21.246
Henry, you fucking drongo.

36:21.246 --> 36:22.178
What?

36:25.422 --> 36:26.596
Doids.

36:51.138 --> 36:53.140
What have you done,
you fucking psycho?

37:31.764 --> 37:32.834
Sam?

37:32.834 --> 37:35.043
Yeah. Doids been
taken care of.

37:39.738 --> 37:40.808
You know who sent him?

37:40.808 --> 37:43.086
I never got
the chance to ask.

37:43.086 --> 37:44.881
Don't tell me you
fucking killed him.

37:44.881 --> 37:46.262
Close enough.

37:46.262 --> 37:48.298
He won't be leaving
hospital for a while.

37:49.955 --> 37:52.130
Don't fuck up anything for
yourself, okay?

37:53.303 --> 37:55.340
Lawyer said you could
be out in a few weeks.

37:55.340 --> 37:56.893
Prosecution's case fell apart.

37:59.965 --> 38:01.415
How'd you, uh, pull that of
off?

38:01.415 --> 38:02.623
Doesn't matter.

38:04.521 --> 38:07.386
Looking forward to having
my big, ugly brother back.

38:07.386 --> 38:09.664
Life's been getting a little
too easy without you.

38:12.736 --> 38:15.256
Yeah, yeah, I miss you too,
you little cock.

38:49.428 --> 38:50.257
What?

38:51.361 --> 38:52.880
What?

38:52.880 --> 38:54.847
You wanna fuck me?
What's wrong with you?

38:55.779 --> 38:56.746
The fuck you looking at?

38:58.161 --> 38:59.404
This fuck.

38:59.404 --> 39:01.682
I thought you'd be
having a bit of a,

39:01.682 --> 39:04.271
bit of a sleep in after
your big night on it.

39:04.271 --> 39:05.651
- Yeah.
- You're a fucking machine.

39:05.651 --> 39:06.687
What you reckon,
was a good start?

39:06.687 --> 39:07.653
Top notch.

39:07.653 --> 39:08.723
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

39:09.897 --> 39:11.209
You got any left?

39:11.209 --> 39:12.210
You fucking joking, right?

39:15.834 --> 39:16.835
Hey brother.

39:28.916 --> 39:30.366
- Hey Bob.
- How's it going?

39:30.366 --> 39:32.713
- Oi!
- Yeah?

39:32.713 --> 39:35.509
Remember that contract on
Ibrahim, Thommo told us about?

39:35.509 --> 39:36.372
Yeah.

39:36.579 --> 39:38.650
Cabramatta reckons the
hitter is this bloke.

39:41.618 --> 39:42.447
Remember him?

39:42.447 --> 39:44.587
We pinched him
a few years back.

39:44.587 --> 39:45.657
Yeah, I do.

40:24.040 --> 40:26.007
What's up?

40:26.284 --> 40:28.458
Drums are way too loud now.

40:28.458 --> 40:30.529
This could be the
last time we do this.

40:30.529 --> 40:32.876
Oh, that is a shame.

40:32.876 --> 40:34.430
Not like I'll miss you.

40:34.430 --> 40:35.845
I got a name for you.

40:35.845 --> 40:36.915
Don't worry about it.

40:36.915 --> 40:38.157
It's all sorted.

40:38.157 --> 40:39.745
Some prick named Doids.

40:39.745 --> 40:40.746
Doids?

40:40.850 --> 40:42.403
Yeah, he killed his
mate's girlfriend for pay.

40:42.403 --> 40:44.923
No, I know who Doids is,
that's not him.

40:48.202 --> 40:50.100
It's a bloke named
Henry Jambor.

40:51.895 --> 40:52.758
Fuck.

40:53.621 --> 40:54.726
Fuck.

41:01.284 --> 41:02.043
Fuck.

41:02.043 --> 41:03.251
Sam got the wrong guy.

41:03.251 --> 41:04.943
Fuck.

41:04.943 --> 41:06.634
What are you looking for?

41:06.634 --> 41:07.877
Fucking phone.

41:07.877 --> 41:09.982
I told you
it's too small much.

41:09.982 --> 41:11.467
Shut up and fucking drive.

42:05.210 --> 42:07.108
Move, move, move, move,
move you fucking ass.

42:07.108 --> 42:08.627
Sorry, fuck, move.

42:11.837 --> 42:13.287
Fuck.

42:22.400 --> 42:23.780
No, please, please, please.

42:23.780 --> 42:25.541
Please don't kill me!

42:26.749 --> 42:28.613
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

42:33.549 --> 42:34.412
Gary!

42:34.515 --> 42:36.517
Keep your
fucking voice down.

42:38.346 --> 42:40.866
They told me to
give you a hotshot.

42:40.866 --> 42:42.765
I've already
got a life sentence, Sam.

42:42.765 --> 42:45.043
I've got this cunt,
I'm doing life anyway.

42:45.043 --> 42:47.286
They paid off my
mum's credit cards.

42:49.081 --> 42:52.153
I didn't have a choice,
she's very sick.

42:57.089 --> 42:58.746
You can go.

43:33.609 --> 43:34.920
Sam?

43:35.956 --> 43:38.234
It's done.

44:03.846 --> 44:05.675
How's it going Dickie?

44:06.780 --> 44:09.161
What? You reckon I'm a dog?

44:09.161 --> 44:10.646
Can't be too careful.

44:17.445 --> 44:18.446
What's going on?

44:19.413 --> 44:22.036
You hear about this
shooting a while back?

44:22.036 --> 44:24.349
Some Vietnamese wanker
got knocked.

44:28.422 --> 44:30.458
The Viets, they think
Sam did it.

44:31.183 --> 44:32.530
Tried to kill him
for it too.

44:33.910 --> 44:35.325
Now, he didn't.

44:35.671 --> 44:37.811
But whoever actually did it,

44:38.328 --> 44:39.744
they need to fix it.

44:41.331 --> 44:42.747
Now lucky for them,

44:42.747 --> 44:45.370
I mean, there's a few more
days before Sam gets out.

44:49.754 --> 44:53.689
And uh, well they need to make
it right, otherwise Sam will.

44:54.448 --> 44:56.761
So I suggest you let your
mates know that, yeah?

44:57.693 --> 44:58.659
It'll be fixed.

45:01.938 --> 45:03.388
It'll be fixed.

46:51.669 --> 46:52.462
Fuck it!

49:54.437 --> 49:56.543
I don't know who you had
to fuck to get me out,

49:56.543 --> 49:58.752
but it's nice to be
back in the jungle.

49:58.752 --> 50:00.823
What does that
make you? Tarzan?

50:02.135 --> 50:03.895
Yeah and you're my chimp.

50:11.420 --> 50:14.561
Sammy, my man.
Good to see you brother.

50:16.011 --> 50:17.184
Just get out hey?
Just bust out?

50:17.184 --> 50:18.979
Hey Stuart.
Fuck off?

50:18.979 --> 50:21.464
- Something's going to explode.
- Hey!

50:23.673 --> 50:25.365
Who's that fucker?

50:26.366 --> 50:27.677
Just some dealer.

50:28.782 --> 50:31.198
So I heard you setting
the door pricing now.

50:32.441 --> 50:34.201
What was I supposed to do?
You weren't here.

50:34.201 --> 50:36.617
Everything's pretty much
as you left it.

50:36.617 --> 50:39.344
Then who are all these
new faces, and the dealers?

50:39.966 --> 50:40.898
Not my department.

50:41.036 --> 50:43.555
But setting the door price
is your department?

50:44.591 --> 50:46.420
It's good to have you back.

50:55.843 --> 50:57.121
Hello?

51:00.055 --> 51:01.815
Who is this?

51:02.229 --> 51:05.163
That's the
drums of war, Johnny.
