00:07.424 --> 00:08.925
<i>Hey, it's Hollyhock.</i>

00:09.009 --> 00:12.053
<i>Leave a message, if you're a hundred.</i>

00:12.137 --> 00:13.054
Hey, Hollyhock.

00:13.138 --> 00:15.807
Um, you still haven't returned
my last call, which is fine.

00:15.890 --> 00:18.143
I just... I know you're going back
to school soon,

00:18.226 --> 00:21.146
and you should know I won't be there.

00:21.229 --> 00:24.357
Because of... everything
you've probably heard about.

00:24.441 --> 00:27.610
So, if you were worried
you'd have to see me, you won't.

00:27.694 --> 00:29.070
But I would love to talk.

00:29.946 --> 00:31.448
-It's BoJack.

00:34.701 --> 00:38.413
<i>Welcome to Burritos and Mo!</i>
<i>Home of burritos and much, much mo!</i>

00:38.496 --> 00:42.375
-Give me a large number three.
<i>-Oh, my God. Ellie! Look at the monitor.</i>

00:42.459 --> 00:45.003
<i>It's fricking BoJack Horseman.</i>
<i>Don't worry, I muted it.</i>

00:45.503 --> 00:48.256
- <i>He looks like crap.</i>
<i>-Yeah. His tie is all loosened up,</i>

00:48.339 --> 00:51.009
<i>which is like the universal sign</i>
<i>for having a shitty day.</i>

00:51.092 --> 00:53.470
<i>Probably because he just came</i>
<i>from court. It's all over the news.</i>

00:53.553 --> 00:56.639
<i>He just settled with Sarah Lynn's family</i>
<i>for five million dollars.</i>

00:56.723 --> 00:59.184
<i>Makes sense. He seemed like</i>
<i>a real psycho in that interview</i>

00:59.267 --> 01:00.810
<i>-he did a few months back.</i>
-Yeah. Guys.

01:00.894 --> 01:03.146
<i>I'm surprised he'd still</i>
<i>wanna show his face in public.</i>

01:03.229 --> 01:04.481
-Hey!
- <i>His face is everywhere.</i>

01:04.564 --> 01:06.191
<i>-The cover of every magazine.</i>
-Okay.

01:06.274 --> 01:08.985
<i>Even got the number-one slot</i>
<i>for Hundred Most Hatted Men.</i>

01:09.069 --> 01:11.112
-No, it--
- <i>Most Hatted Men? What is that?</i>

01:11.196 --> 01:13.823
<i>List of men in hats, I guess.</i>
<i>He was wearing a fedora.</i>

01:13.907 --> 01:15.116
It was Most Hated Men!

01:15.200 --> 01:16.284
- <i>What?</i>

01:16.493 --> 01:19.287
It was the Hundred Most Hated Men,
it was a newsboy cap,

01:19.370 --> 01:21.122
and I can hear everything
you've been saying!

01:21.206 --> 01:22.415
<i>Uh...</i>

01:22.624 --> 01:25.710
- <i>Get his bags, Ellie!</i>
<i>-You said you muted it!</i>

01:27.045 --> 01:32.300
- Have a burrito-ful day!
- Hey!  You suck, asshole!

02:31.359 --> 02:33.570
I don't think it's wise
to be burning Bridges at this juncture.

02:33.653 --> 02:35.530
I'm sorry, just don't like Beau.

02:35.613 --> 02:37.115
-Greetings, strangers!
-Maude?

02:37.198 --> 02:38.741
That's what they want you to think!

02:38.825 --> 02:41.911
I'm Maude's twin sister Fergus,
we have never met before,

02:41.995 --> 02:44.831
and I'd be delighted to accept a job
at this company.

02:44.914 --> 02:47.333
- What?
-As you know, I have 12 children.

02:47.458 --> 02:49.669
What sort of day care services
do you provide here?

02:49.752 --> 02:52.046
Has this ever happened to you?

02:52.130 --> 02:53.590
Todd? At the office?

02:53.673 --> 02:55.675
Can we wrap whatever this is up?

02:55.758 --> 02:57.886
I'm supposed to head over
to the "Birthday Dad" set.

02:57.969 --> 02:59.554
I wanna run a day care at VIM!

02:59.637 --> 03:02.932
I've mastered the art of looking
at one baby and I'm ready for more.

03:03.016 --> 03:05.185
You do have several employees
with children.

03:05.268 --> 03:06.769
If you employ Todd through the company,

03:06.853 --> 03:09.272
you could offer him a raise
and still save money on taxes.

03:09.355 --> 03:10.190
Great. It's done.

03:10.356 --> 03:12.901
Hooray! Corporate tax loophole!

03:12.984 --> 03:14.944
Plus, we can carpool to the office.

03:15.028 --> 03:19.157
Which leads me to my next point.
I am moving out to live with Maude.

03:19.240 --> 03:21.784
It's me! It's Maude.
I don't really have a twin sister.

03:21.868 --> 03:24.662
Hey, that's fantastic!
Where are you moving to?

03:24.746 --> 03:25.747
Um...

03:25.830 --> 03:28.833
-You can stay here! Live with me forever!
- Cut!

03:29.250 --> 03:31.461
The line is,
"Thank you for the birthday pizza.

03:31.544 --> 03:32.795
Today, I am your dad."

03:32.879 --> 03:35.173
-Oh, sorry!
-Let's take five?

03:35.256 --> 03:38.218
-Hey, champ. Everything okay?
-I'm just distracted.

03:38.301 --> 03:41.763
Ever since Pickles left, I've been
so lonely in that big, empty house.

03:41.846 --> 03:44.891
I've always had a wife or a girlfriend,
someone to take care of.

03:44.974 --> 03:46.851
Princess Carolyn,
you're perpetually alone.

03:46.935 --> 03:49.979
-How do you manage?
-One day at a time, buddy.

03:50.063 --> 03:52.065
I went to the doctor to see
if he could make me feel better,

03:52.148 --> 03:54.067
he said, "You should check out
this Internet meme,

03:54.150 --> 03:56.444
it always cheers me up: Sad Dog."

03:56.527 --> 04:00.365
And I said, "But Doctor, I am Sad Dog."

04:01.115 --> 04:04.953
Guys, I'm really sorry
this keeps happening.

04:05.036 --> 04:08.915
When I got home, I found my wife
and daughter had moved out.

04:08.998 --> 04:10.708
All they left behind was this picture.

04:11.584 --> 04:13.419
-Okay. Rude.
-Shh!

04:13.503 --> 04:15.797
It's the stock photo
that came in the frame.

04:15.880 --> 04:21.302
My wife kept asking me to put in a picture
of our family, but I was always too drunk.

04:21.386 --> 04:24.097
But because of all of you
and my sponsor Leo,

04:24.222 --> 04:27.183
I'm no longer just the man
who's not in this picture.

04:27.267 --> 04:31.646
I'm a different, better man
who is also not in this picture.

04:31.854 --> 04:33.022
Who's next?

04:37.360 --> 04:39.320
-Um, okay, I'll speak.
-Ugh.

04:39.445 --> 04:41.406
Things have been pretty brutal
for me lately.

04:41.489 --> 04:43.032
-Most people hate me...
-Mm-hmm.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.910
...I just lost five million dollars,
so that's not great.

04:45.994 --> 04:49.163
Could probably use a Leo
of my own right about now.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.582
Wow, tough room.

04:51.666 --> 04:54.961
This AA meeting is a tough room.

05:01.676 --> 05:03.886
Hey, I'll be your sponsor.

05:04.262 --> 05:05.179
Oh! Um...

05:05.263 --> 05:07.056
I know what you're thinking,
"Vance Waggoner?

05:07.140 --> 05:08.641
That guy's gonna be my sponsor?

05:08.725 --> 05:11.436
The guy Charlie Sheen
once called 'a little much'?"

05:11.519 --> 05:13.062
-Uh...
-"Vance Waggoner?

05:13.146 --> 05:15.982
That guy's got more domestic assault
convictions than Sean Penn!"

05:16.107 --> 05:17.108
And now you're thinking,

05:17.191 --> 05:19.402
"Did Sean Penn get convicted
of domestic assault

05:19.485 --> 05:21.321
or was it just alleged?
I gotta look that up later."

05:21.404 --> 05:22.780
-I'm sure--
-Now you're thinking,

05:22.905 --> 05:25.742
"Why would someone this cool
and put-together wanna sponsor me,

05:25.825 --> 05:28.036
-dumb slob BoJack Horseman?"
-That's not--

05:28.119 --> 05:31.789
Wait. I've been where you've been, BoJack.
And everyone abandoned me.

05:31.873 --> 05:35.084
If you need someone to talk to,
give me a call, okay?

05:35.168 --> 05:39.672
My number is 555-555-8008.

05:39.756 --> 05:41.966
Because sometimes
life turns you upside-down,

05:42.050 --> 05:47.430
and when you're upside-down,
my number is boobs.

05:53.019 --> 05:53.853
-Hello?

05:53.936 --> 05:55.772
Diane! How are the revisions going?

05:55.897 --> 05:58.941
Good! Usually at this stage
I hate everything I've ever written

05:59.025 --> 06:02.904
and I feel like a worthless hack,
but this book actually isn't terrible.

06:02.987 --> 06:05.406
Great, so when can we expect
the not-terrible sequel,

06:05.490 --> 06:08.117
"Ivy Tran Two: A Tran for All Seasons"?

06:08.201 --> 06:11.788
I don't know, Ivy Tran was fun
but I'm a grown-up writer.

06:11.871 --> 06:14.665
<i>There are other things I wanna write.</i>
<i>Did you know Eleanor Roosevelt--</i>

06:14.749 --> 06:17.085
-Interesting.
-I didn't even tell you the thing.

06:17.168 --> 06:19.754
I know.
I was interested in you not telling me.

06:19.879 --> 06:20.963
Okay, good bit.

06:21.089 --> 06:21.923
In the meantime,

06:22.048 --> 06:25.676
if you're interested in writing books
that people actually read,

06:25.760 --> 06:29.389
you'll get to work on "Ivy Tran Two:
Last Tran to Clarksville."

06:29.472 --> 06:31.307
-Eleanor Roosevelt once--
<i>-Interesting!</i>

06:35.937 --> 06:38.106
<i>And those congressional</i>
<i>turd-weasels</i>

06:38.189 --> 06:41.734
<i>actually called this legislation</i>
<i>the "Anti-Corruption Bill!"</i>

06:41.818 --> 06:44.362
<i>That's like if BoJack Horseman</i>
<i>wore a T-shirt that said,</i>

06:44.445 --> 06:47.615
<i>"I am not a ginormous dick-weasel!"</i>

06:47.698 --> 06:49.826
Hey, that is an unfair drive-by!

06:49.909 --> 06:53.121
<i>Now, I know this Photoshop is not up</i>
<i>to our program's usual standards,</i>

06:53.204 --> 06:55.081
<i>but in our graphic department's defense,</i>

06:55.164 --> 06:58.584
<i>none of them could spend ten minutes</i>
<i>looking at this ass-weasel</i>

06:58.668 --> 07:01.087
<i>without their uteruses</i>
<i>literally throwing up.</i>

07:01.212 --> 07:02.755
-Ugh!

07:05.091 --> 07:05.925
-Yes?

07:06.008 --> 07:08.010
BoJack, it's your very good
accountant Gaz.

07:08.136 --> 07:10.471
-I'm here with...
-Your very good lawyer Chaz!

07:11.097 --> 07:11.931
Okay.

07:12.014 --> 07:14.767
The good news is the Sarah Lynn settlement
isn't gonna kill us.

07:14.851 --> 07:15.726
What's the bad news?

07:15.852 --> 07:18.604
The bad news is you're being sued
for a hundred million dollars.

07:18.688 --> 07:20.648
-What?
-Remember in your interview,

07:20.731 --> 07:24.986
when you disparagingly referred
to yourself as "a Xerox of a Xerox"?

07:25.069 --> 07:26.904
The Xerox Corporation did not appreciate

07:26.988 --> 07:29.282
being implicated
in your untoward behavior.

07:29.365 --> 07:32.660
Just so I'm clear, Sarah Lynn's death
cost me five million dollars,

07:32.743 --> 07:36.372
but saying something bad about a brand
is gonna cost me a hundred million?

07:36.456 --> 07:38.833
When you frame it that way,
it almost seems comical!

07:38.916 --> 07:40.168
But it is not comical,

07:40.251 --> 07:43.254
because a hundred million dollars
is a lot of money you do not have.

07:43.337 --> 07:44.505
Okay, so what's the move?

07:44.589 --> 07:47.175
-Funny you should mention "move."

07:47.258 --> 07:49.385
Your accountant told me
you wanted to sell your house?

07:49.469 --> 07:51.971
-Okay, I'm gonna call you back.
-So, I sold your house!

07:52.054 --> 07:54.390
Wow-ee! It looks better than the pictures!

07:54.474 --> 07:56.350
-You sold my house?
-Golly, are you...?

07:56.434 --> 07:58.060
Sylvester Stallion.
From the Rocky movies.

07:58.144 --> 08:00.771
Oh! Hey, you kids wanna go check out
the pool?

08:00.855 --> 08:02.315
- Yeah!
- I love my new life!

08:02.398 --> 08:03.232
You sold my house?

08:03.316 --> 08:07.862
I found this sweet, sweet family from Ohio
whose kid just got cast in a movie!

08:07.987 --> 08:09.739
I wanted to make sure the ink dried
on the mortgage

08:09.822 --> 08:12.992
before they find out the movie's
being shot in Saskatchewan.

08:13.075 --> 08:13.993
So, where do I go?

08:14.076 --> 08:16.120
What do I look like, a real estate agent?

08:16.621 --> 08:18.289
-Wait.
-Yeah?

08:18.372 --> 08:19.499
Your mail came.

08:19.582 --> 08:22.543
-Now leave. You're harshing the buzz.
-But...

08:28.257 --> 08:29.091
Huh?

08:45.608 --> 08:49.612
-Well, I'm all moved in.
- Me too.

08:50.071 --> 08:54.617
Wow! Got a promotion
and my own apartment all in the same day.

08:54.700 --> 08:59.163
-I never realized my boyfriend was butter.
-You're right. I am on a roll!

08:59.247 --> 09:00.540
What should I do next?

09:01.582 --> 09:04.752
Chavez residence, this is Jorge.
Please state the purpose of your call

09:04.835 --> 09:07.129
so I can most appropriately
modulate my tone.

09:07.213 --> 09:09.423
Hey, it's Todd. Is Mom there?

09:09.507 --> 09:11.300
Ah! Todd! Yes.

09:11.384 --> 09:14.095
Oh. She's resting at the moment.
Can I take a message?

09:14.178 --> 09:17.890
I just wanted her to know that
I don't have anything to prove to her,

09:17.974 --> 09:20.643
but I got a new job and an apartment,

09:20.726 --> 09:23.312
so if I did have something
to prove to her,

09:23.396 --> 09:26.107
-I'd have proven it by now.
-Well, that's wonderful, Todd.

09:26.190 --> 09:29.694
Yes. And quite mature.
And she won't even talk to me.

09:29.819 --> 09:32.280
-Does she know I'm butter?
-I'm glad to hear you're on a roll.

09:32.363 --> 09:33.990
We'd love to see your home
once you're settled.

09:34.073 --> 09:37.535
What's that supposed to mean?
I'm settled! I'm a grown-ass Todd!

09:37.660 --> 09:40.204
-No, I just meant--
-I don't need to impress you!

09:40.329 --> 09:42.748
Why don't you come
to my fancy, sophisticated

09:42.832 --> 09:46.168
housewarming party tomorrow night
and see for yourself!

09:46.252 --> 09:48.004
Consider us there. What can we bring?

09:48.087 --> 09:49.964
-Two chairs!

09:50.047 --> 09:52.049
We could throw together a party, right?

09:52.592 --> 09:53.759
Um...

09:54.176 --> 09:55.803
-No.
-I need a job.

09:55.886 --> 09:56.762
There are no offers.

09:56.846 --> 10:00.474
-Can you check? Ask around?
-I'm checking. I'm asking around.

10:00.558 --> 10:04.520
- There are no offers.
-But I'm broke and homeless.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.982
I can get you a small role
on "Birthday Dad."

10:08.107 --> 10:10.943
Great. Have my pages delivered
to me at the Chateau Marmoset.

10:11.027 --> 10:13.529
-You just said you're broke!
-And homeless.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.531
You are not staying at a fancy hotel.

10:15.615 --> 10:16.991
Who else would have me?

10:17.074 --> 10:19.827
You could stay here! Live with me forever!

10:26.334 --> 10:28.961
And flip! Morning, sunshine!

10:29.045 --> 10:30.921
I hope I didn't wake you
with the delicious smell

10:31.005 --> 10:32.298
of a well-balanced breakfast.

10:32.381 --> 10:35.009
-Less talky. More coffee.
-You got it, roomie!

10:35.092 --> 10:37.178
-Coffee maker, make!

10:37.261 --> 10:40.640
Took the liberty of doing your laundry
and this letter was in your pocket.

10:40.723 --> 10:43.643
-Ooh-hoo! A mysterious pen pal!

10:43.726 --> 10:46.812
Is it a secret admirer
or the snowman killer still at large?

10:46.896 --> 10:48.689
It's from Hollyhock. But...

10:48.773 --> 10:51.901
I can't open it. What if she says
she never wants to hear from me again?

10:51.984 --> 10:56.155
Or maybe it says "I got rid of my TV
three months ago. What's new, BoJack?"

10:56.238 --> 10:57.531
I should just call her.

10:57.615 --> 10:59.909
If I could talk to her,
I feel like I could explain that--

10:59.992 --> 11:03.496
<i>Hey, it's Hollyhock.</i>
<i>Leave a message, if you're a hundred.</i>

11:03.579 --> 11:05.665
-Hey, Hollyhock. It's me again.

11:05.748 --> 11:08.084
And his good friend and roommate
and coworker, Mr. Peanutbutter!

11:08.167 --> 11:09.710
It's our first day of work together!

11:09.794 --> 11:11.837
I got your letter
and I haven't read it yet,

11:11.921 --> 11:13.839
but I'm going to and...

11:14.131 --> 11:17.343
It's really great to hear your voice...
your voicemail voice.

11:17.426 --> 11:19.553
-Just give me a call. It's BoJack.

11:19.637 --> 11:21.722
-Ready to go?
-What about this breakfast?

11:21.806 --> 11:25.393
We don't have time for that!
You can feed me while I drive, let's go!

11:27.770 --> 11:29.730
<i>-♪ Precision... ♪</i>
- Oh, whoa!

11:29.814 --> 11:32.650
-Easy. Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop!

11:32.733 --> 11:34.694
Hey, Judah. I need your advice.

11:34.777 --> 11:36.946
I'm trying to throw
a sophisticated adult party

11:37.029 --> 11:38.072
to impress my parents

11:38.155 --> 11:41.325
and I have no furniture
or sophisticated adult friends.

11:41.409 --> 11:45.413
I'm alarmed. Do you not consider me
a sophisticated adult or a friend?

11:45.496 --> 11:48.457
Judah, this is no time for one
of your famous Judah tantrums!

11:48.541 --> 11:51.752
Sounds like you need to throw together
a scheme in a short amount of time.

11:51.836 --> 11:53.421
In situations like this, I often think,

11:53.504 --> 11:55.005
-"What would Todd do?"
-And?

11:55.089 --> 11:56.549
He'd probably scour VIM's talent list

11:56.632 --> 11:58.592
for underemployed actors,
tell them they've been hired

11:58.676 --> 12:01.554
for a site-specific immersive
theater piece as cosmopolitan partygoers,

12:01.637 --> 12:04.390
invite just enough real friends
to lend it an air of legitimacy

12:04.473 --> 12:05.891
and raid the "Birthday Dad" set
for furniture.

12:05.975 --> 12:09.270
That's brilliant!
Todd, I've done it again!

12:09.353 --> 12:11.647
-Let's go, babies!

12:11.731 --> 12:14.608
Uh... Babies. Come on!

12:19.447 --> 12:20.364
War.

12:20.823 --> 12:22.450
And for what?

12:22.533 --> 12:24.869
-A couple trophies? A parade?

12:24.952 --> 12:27.121
No. Not for me.

12:27.204 --> 12:29.248
Maybe I'm just a crazy,
old birthday person,

12:29.331 --> 12:31.584
-but I think war is bad.

12:31.667 --> 12:35.171
Great job, Mr. Peanutbutter.
You're changing hearts and minds.

12:35.629 --> 12:37.339
Isn't this great? Working together?

12:37.423 --> 12:39.550
For the next take,
can we get Dead Body Number Four

12:39.633 --> 12:41.427
to face away from the camera?

12:41.510 --> 12:42.970
-Oh! That's you!
-Yeah.

12:43.053 --> 12:45.806
-Exciting!

12:45.890 --> 12:47.600
All the way away
from the camera.

12:49.560 --> 12:50.978
I can't really breathe.

12:51.061 --> 12:53.314
That's okay. Let's run it again.

12:55.357 --> 12:57.276
-Cool dressing room.

12:57.359 --> 12:58.652
And great work on that scene.

12:58.736 --> 13:01.197
You really seemed like
a hollowed-out corpse.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.157
Once animated by the fire of life,

13:03.240 --> 13:06.952
now consumed by horror
and regret, and for what?

13:07.036 --> 13:08.078
Great. You wanna get dinner?

13:08.162 --> 13:11.207
Oh, I'd love to, buddy,
but I have like five more scenes to shoot.

13:11.290 --> 13:15.127
Oh. Of course, yeah.
I'll see you back at the house then?

13:15.211 --> 13:19.256
Yeah. Oh! I'm probably going to head
right to Todd's fancy party after work.

13:19.340 --> 13:20.716
Todd's having a fancy party?

13:20.800 --> 13:22.384
Mr. Peanutbutter,
we're ready for the scene

13:22.468 --> 13:24.970
where you help an American soldier
and a Taliban insurgent

13:25.054 --> 13:26.639
realize they both have the same birthday.

13:26.722 --> 13:29.225
-It's Christmas.
-Ugh.

13:38.067 --> 13:39.443
BoJack!

13:40.236 --> 13:41.487
Greetings, cast!

13:41.570 --> 13:42.404
As you know,

13:42.530 --> 13:46.200
you have been hired to play urbane,
civilized party guests.

13:46.283 --> 13:48.077
So, if at any point tonight

13:48.160 --> 13:50.746
a "member of the audience"
tries to talk to you,

13:50.830 --> 13:53.374
please say one
of the three following phrases

13:53.457 --> 13:55.918
that elegant adults say all the time:

13:56.043 --> 14:01.215
"I'm starting to think smart phones
are actually making us less connected."

14:01.298 --> 14:05.135
-Oh, yeah!
-"Well, that's politics for you!"

14:05.219 --> 14:10.808
Or, "Sir, you cannot remove your shoes
inside this Applebee's."

14:10.891 --> 14:12.184
Ooh!

14:12.977 --> 14:14.061
-Hey!
-Hello.

14:14.144 --> 14:15.062
What's that?

14:15.145 --> 14:18.607
It's a case of Ass-Jolt,
Pickles' favorite alcoholic energy drink.

14:18.941 --> 14:21.402
I don't need them anymore.

14:22.027 --> 14:24.697
-Oh, fish, I forgot a gift.
-You have two options.

14:24.780 --> 14:27.199
This sourdough starter
or a haiku I wrote on a grain of rice

14:27.283 --> 14:29.368
-and then suspended in a bottle.
-Uh...

14:29.451 --> 14:31.370
Why don't we just say
they're both from both of us?

14:31.453 --> 14:32.538
Yeah.

14:34.790 --> 14:36.750
- Ugh.
-And you don't wanna open it?

14:36.834 --> 14:39.545
I'm not ready. As long as I don't read it,
she's still in my life.

14:39.628 --> 14:42.590
It's good to have people that remind us
why we stay sober.

14:42.673 --> 14:44.300
That's what my daughter is for me.

14:44.383 --> 14:48.846
Here's your sandwich.
Chef made it just for you.

14:48.929 --> 14:50.848
Hmph, hmph, hmph.

14:52.933 --> 14:54.101
Okay, do I have a horn?

14:54.184 --> 14:57.062
Because everybody keeps looking at me
like I'm some kind of freak.

14:57.146 --> 15:00.274
Well, if you've got a horn,
you're the ugliest unicorn I ever saw.

15:00.399 --> 15:02.443
You'd be kicked out of the unicorn kingdom

15:02.526 --> 15:06.030
because you couldn't get a date
to the marshmallow cotillion.

15:06.113 --> 15:09.033
Yeah, or because I snorted up
all the magic fairy glitter.

15:09.116 --> 15:11.493
"This summer:
Dumbass Unicorn."

15:11.619 --> 15:14.496
That's so stupid.
No, that's exactly what they'd do.

15:14.580 --> 15:18.292
It would be like
"Nasty Unicorn: The Unicorn Who Parties."

15:18.375 --> 15:20.502
Yeah, and his horn
is like a corkscrew,

15:20.586 --> 15:23.172
and he tries to open a bottle of wine,
but it gets stuck,

15:23.255 --> 15:25.382
so now he's got this wine bottle
on his head,

15:25.466 --> 15:27.009
just dripping wine down his face,

15:27.092 --> 15:29.094
-like...

15:29.303 --> 15:30.346
"Nasty Unicorn.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.306
He puts the 'U' in 'Eff you.'"

15:32.389 --> 15:36.143
Okay, but it wouldn't be "Nasty Unicorn."
It would be "Horny Unicorn"!

15:36.226 --> 15:38.646
Oh, shit, that's amazing.
Now we have to do it.

15:38.729 --> 15:40.230
What do you mean "do it"?

15:40.314 --> 15:43.359
The movie. You're the Horny Unicorn.
I'll direct. We're doing it.

15:43.442 --> 15:46.737
Yeah. I'm not really the guy
people wanna see in movies right now.

15:46.820 --> 15:50.282
Yeah, they don't wanna see you
be <i>Secretariat</i> or raising orphans.

15:50.366 --> 15:52.242
But they will see you be a rude dude

15:52.326 --> 15:55.454
who says all the things polite society
is too limp-dicked to say.

15:55.537 --> 15:58.540
This is your way back in.
This is how you get that love back.

15:58.749 --> 15:59.833
"The Horny Unicorn"?

15:59.917 --> 16:03.671
Yeah, 'cause deep down, he's wounded.
He's misunderstood.

16:03.754 --> 16:05.255
It's not his fault he's the way he is!

16:05.339 --> 16:07.341
-And people are gonna see that!
-Yeah?

16:07.424 --> 16:11.261
Yeah! He's like, "Hey, buddy!
I never asked to be the horny unicorn!

16:11.345 --> 16:13.889
What? You think I like it that
I gotta jizz rainbows every 20 minutes

16:13.973 --> 16:15.391
to keep my horn from going soft?"

16:15.474 --> 16:17.267
I don't know.

16:17.351 --> 16:19.395
Come on. I know you need the money.

16:19.478 --> 16:21.605
When are you gonna stop
punishing yourself?

16:26.443 --> 16:29.947
Flip it. No, you gotta...
Flip the thing. Flip it.

16:30.030 --> 16:32.741
Hey, Sonny, do you know
where the advance copy of my book is?

16:32.825 --> 16:34.201
Your stupid book about the mall?

16:34.284 --> 16:36.704
Haven't seen it.
'Cause I would never even notice it.

16:36.787 --> 16:39.832
-'Cause it's for losers. Girl losers.

16:40.082 --> 16:41.375
You can just say losers.

16:41.500 --> 16:44.753
Girls can be losers without specifying
that they're girls.

16:44.837 --> 16:47.631
Will you let me know if you see it?
I need to get revisions to my publisher.

16:47.715 --> 16:49.758
Sounds like a "you" problem.

16:51.427 --> 16:52.511
Girl loser.

16:59.184 --> 17:01.353
-Hello.
-We're here for the party?

17:01.437 --> 17:02.563
We brought a plant.

17:02.646 --> 17:05.274
Uh, just one sec.

17:06.734 --> 17:10.070
I'm starting to think smart phones
are actually making us less connected.

17:10.154 --> 17:12.906
-They are!
-Well, that's politics for you.

17:12.990 --> 17:16.243
-It is!
-Hey, man. Uh...

17:16.326 --> 17:18.620
-What's going on?
-We're here for the party.

17:18.704 --> 17:19.997
We brought a plant.

17:20.080 --> 17:24.001
Look...  BoJack,
don't make me ask you to leave.

17:24.084 --> 17:25.836
-You don't have to--
-Come on, dude. Let us in.

17:25.919 --> 17:28.213
-This plant's heavy as tits.
-I don't want a whole thing here.

17:28.297 --> 17:31.884
My mom is coming
and I haven't spoken to her in ten years,

17:31.967 --> 17:33.802
and I can't risk anything happening.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.554
What do you think is going to "happen"?

17:35.637 --> 17:38.766
I don't know, man,
but something always happens with you

17:38.849 --> 17:44.188
and usually I've been cool because I know
you're always dealing with your own shit,

17:44.271 --> 17:45.981
but I can't risk it tonight.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.817
I'm sober. Nothing is going to happen.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.944
Yeah, bro, what do you think's gonna--
Oh, shit.

17:51.028 --> 17:52.154
Ugh!

17:54.239 --> 17:55.741
I'll see you around.

17:58.494 --> 18:00.496
We spent like 30 bucks on that plant.

18:03.624 --> 18:08.170
Yes, I have made mistakes. So, now what?
I'm just supposed to go away forever?

18:08.253 --> 18:09.922
I'm sorry, but that's bullshit.

18:10.005 --> 18:12.299
This is where you find out
who your real friends are.

18:12.382 --> 18:15.094
Part of being sober is leaving behind
all the people

18:15.177 --> 18:17.429
who can't stop seeing you as the person
who pissed in the fountain

18:17.513 --> 18:19.515
-at my own daughter's sweet 16.
-Yeah?

18:19.598 --> 18:23.185
You think you owe them something
because they tolerated you at your worst,

18:23.268 --> 18:27.064
but these people enjoy seeing you fail
because it lets them feel superior.

18:27.147 --> 18:30.234
They don't know how to process it
when you're no longer the huge screw-up

18:30.317 --> 18:33.362
who hijacked a Meals On Wheels van
to bring my friends to a strip club.

18:33.529 --> 18:36.156
-I don't know--
-I do. You know what else I know?

18:36.240 --> 18:37.991
You gotta go where the love is.

18:38.408 --> 18:40.077
Yeah. Maybe.

18:40.160 --> 18:42.287
That's why we gotta make "Horny Unicorn."

18:42.371 --> 18:45.999
Because it's gonna make a billion dollars
and drive all those assholes crazy!

18:46.416 --> 18:48.168
It would be good to have something
to keep me busy.

18:48.252 --> 18:49.962
See? That's what I'm talking about!

18:50.045 --> 18:52.339
-There he is! There's my Horn-corn!

18:53.340 --> 18:55.592
-Ah, shit. My daughter's in trouble.
-What is it?

18:55.676 --> 18:57.469
You mind if we swing by EWE.S.C.
real quick?

18:57.553 --> 18:59.596
EWE.S.C.? I'm trying to keep
a low profile.

18:59.680 --> 19:02.558
-I don't think a college campus--
-BoJack, this is my daughter, okay?

19:02.641 --> 19:05.310
She's the one person I care about,
the one thing keeping me sober.

19:05.394 --> 19:07.563
-Why do you need me to go with you?
-Unbelievable.

19:07.646 --> 19:09.731
When everyone else abandoned you,
who was there for you?

19:09.815 --> 19:11.650
When the world judged you
and ridiculed you?

19:11.733 --> 19:13.861
And now, the one time
I need something from you...

19:13.944 --> 19:15.237
Okay. I'm in.

19:15.320 --> 19:17.948
Or as the horny unicorn would say,
"Am I in?"

19:18.031 --> 19:20.033
Oh, you're in, baby!

19:23.871 --> 19:27.040
No. No. Come on, come on,
come on! Come on!

19:27.124 --> 19:30.419
-What the hell, Diane?
-Ah! I'm working! I'm just taking a break.

19:30.502 --> 19:34.089
-Oh, you found my book?
-Yeah, and it sucked. Totally unrealistic.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.049
-You read my book?
-I've been reading it.

19:36.133 --> 19:38.010
Obviously, I wasn't gonna say it
in front of my friends,

19:38.093 --> 19:41.346
because it's a book for girl babies,
but anyways it didn't even make sense!

19:41.430 --> 19:42.264
What do you mean?

19:42.347 --> 19:46.560
Like, you say the book takes place
in Chicago, but Ivy lives in Schaumburg.

19:46.643 --> 19:49.855
Schaumburg, Diane?
Schaumburg's not Chicago.

19:49.938 --> 19:51.106
It's in the Chicago metropolitan--

19:51.190 --> 19:55.027
Oh, my God, what's next?!
Evanston, Chicago?

19:55.152 --> 19:59.448
Morton Grove, Chicago?
Naperville, Chicago?

19:59.531 --> 20:02.993
-That's what you sound like!
-Okay, it's not too late to change it.

20:03.076 --> 20:04.369
Good. And while you're at it,

20:04.494 --> 20:06.705
-I've got some other questions.
-Yeah?

20:06.788 --> 20:10.417
Like, okay. When Ivy told Moose
that he wasn't her best friend anymore

20:10.500 --> 20:12.920
and Moose said,
"You're still <i>my</i> best friend

20:13.003 --> 20:15.255
whether you like it or not..."

20:15.339 --> 20:17.049
-was that real?
-What do you mean?

20:17.132 --> 20:18.342
Like, did that really happen,

20:18.425 --> 20:20.802
that someone could be
someone's best friend still

20:20.886 --> 20:22.429
even when they're disappointed in them?

20:22.512 --> 20:25.474
Um, yeah, Sonny, that's real.

20:25.599 --> 20:29.353
Okay. And you know how Ivy
kept her dad's watch in her locker

20:29.436 --> 20:32.940
because even though he wasn't around
she still knew that he loved her?

20:33.023 --> 20:36.235
-Was that real, too?
-Well, the book is fiction.

20:36.360 --> 20:40.072
Yeah, no, I get it, I just...
parts of it felt real, you know?

20:40.155 --> 20:41.406
Yeah. I know.

20:41.531 --> 20:44.576
It's cool that you wrote a book.
I mean, I think girls are gonna like it.

20:44.785 --> 20:47.329
Especially girls who, like,
don't have good self-esteem.

20:47.412 --> 20:49.665
-I hope so.
-So, when's the next one coming out?

20:49.748 --> 20:53.168
Just in case you need me to check it
for other mistakes, you know.

20:53.252 --> 20:58.340
Well, if I get started right away,
it should be out by next fall.

20:58.423 --> 21:01.385
-Cool. You gotta flip it.
-Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit!

21:04.763 --> 21:06.890
-Jagger! Jagger!
-Shh, shh.

21:06.974 --> 21:08.892
Hey, hey, hey, keep it down maybe?

21:08.976 --> 21:11.770
Oh, my God, Dad,
is this seriously happening?

21:11.853 --> 21:13.730
-Why are you here?
-You knew what you were doing

21:13.814 --> 21:15.399
when you liked
your mother's Instagram post

21:15.482 --> 21:17.150
of her on the beach
with her new boyfriend.

21:17.234 --> 21:19.111
-What?
-It was a good picture!

21:19.194 --> 21:20.195
That's why we're here?

21:20.279 --> 21:23.365
Every month,
you get five Instagram likes on my account

21:23.448 --> 21:25.033
and five on your mother's account.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.368
You heard what the judge mandated!

21:26.451 --> 21:28.328
Hey, man, let's just go. Okay?
People are starting to--

21:28.412 --> 21:29.997
-Are you BoJack Horseman?
-No.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.290
-Yeah, you are.
-NoJack.

21:31.373 --> 21:34.418
Were you trying to get my attention?
'Cause you got it now, baby!

21:34.501 --> 21:36.712
-Dad!
-The story got picked up by TMZ!

21:36.795 --> 21:37.796
You're ruining my life!

21:37.879 --> 21:39.631
You're making me look like
a real cuck, Jagger.

21:39.715 --> 21:41.967
I'm getting cucked by my own daughter!

21:42.050 --> 21:43.969
You don't even know what that word means!

21:44.052 --> 21:45.304
I just want you to know,

21:45.387 --> 21:47.306
-I think you got a real bum deal.
-Oh, yeah?

21:47.389 --> 21:49.683
You got massively sandbagged
in that interview, bro.

21:49.766 --> 21:53.270
-You were trying to apologize.
-Thank you.

21:53.353 --> 21:56.815
Everything these days is all
"patriarchy" this and "male gaze" that.

21:56.898 --> 21:59.109
And, well, I think it's cool
you're pushing back against that.

21:59.192 --> 22:00.485
Well, no, I'm not pushing back.

22:00.569 --> 22:05.615
No, Bo, I'm saying it's cool.
You can relax here. This is a safe space.

22:05.699 --> 22:07.492
-Okay.
-You're embarrassing me!

22:07.576 --> 22:09.369
Oh, yeah? How's this for embarrassing?

22:09.453 --> 22:15.250
Your last spon-con post for L'Oréal?
It came off as disingenuous!

22:15.334 --> 22:18.503
You know I love my wide array
of L'Oréal products!

22:18.587 --> 22:21.506
From game days with the gals
to cram sessions at the creamery,

22:21.590 --> 22:24.343
L'Oréal gives me the confidence
to shine my brightest!

22:24.468 --> 22:26.011
Do you wanna come back to Delta House?

22:26.094 --> 22:28.930
I think those guys
would be super-stoked to meet you.

22:29.014 --> 22:31.224
-They'd be stoked?
-Super-stoked.

22:31.308 --> 22:32.517
All right, let's get out of here.

22:32.601 --> 22:35.729
My daughter sucks, which is surprising
because I did such a good job raising her.

22:35.812 --> 22:37.314
Let's make one more stop.

22:39.107 --> 22:42.611
-Hey! Looking good!
-Well, that's politics for you!

22:43.695 --> 22:45.864
-Hello?
-Your mother isn't feeling well.

22:45.947 --> 22:47.616
She's still recovering from her surgery.

22:47.699 --> 22:48.867
Oh.

22:48.950 --> 22:52.371
Does that mean you're not coming
to my refined, upscale party

22:52.454 --> 22:56.124
that I totally didn't just throw together
only to impress you?

22:56.208 --> 22:59.461
I'm sorry, uh, no.
But thank you for inviting us.

22:59.544 --> 23:02.964
Jorge, I'm trying to connect to her.

23:03.382 --> 23:05.425
I know. Please keep trying.

23:08.387 --> 23:12.724
I'm starting to think that smart phones
are actually making us less connected.

23:17.270 --> 23:20.357
And then I passed out in the pool.
Sploosh!

23:20.482 --> 23:23.026
Luckily, Lindsay Lohan was there
to perform CPR.

23:23.151 --> 23:26.238
She still credits me for being the reason
she got sober... that time.

23:26.321 --> 23:27.864
Wow.

23:27.948 --> 23:31.284
-Who's Lindsay Lohan?
-She's a celebrity from the olden days.

23:31.368 --> 23:33.870
Olden days? Jesus.

23:33.954 --> 23:35.247
Hey, look, buddy, I gotta go.

23:35.330 --> 23:36.706
I'm gonna walk this co-ed back
to her room.

23:36.790 --> 23:38.500
'Cause, you know, there's pervs out there.

23:38.583 --> 23:40.502
Are you serious?
You're supposed to be my sponsor.

23:40.585 --> 23:42.421
So, what, I gotta hang out
with you all the time?

23:42.504 --> 23:45.590
Relax, okay? I'll call you tomorrow,
we'll set up "Horny Unicorn."

23:45.674 --> 23:47.175
Enjoy your people.

23:47.759 --> 23:48.760
Okay.

23:49.678 --> 23:51.888
-Hey, man. Hey! No pictures!

23:51.972 --> 23:53.348
-Delete that.
-Come on.

23:53.432 --> 23:56.518
Hey, no. You come on.
I'm not here to be your cool story later.

23:56.601 --> 23:58.311
Okay, sorry.

23:58.395 --> 23:59.688
I shouldn't be here.

24:06.611 --> 24:08.989
