WEBVTT

00:15.515 --> 00:16.483
.
>>> GOOD EVENING.

00:16.483 --> 00:23.556
I'M JEANINE PIRRO.
YOU'RE WATCHING "JUSTICE JUDGE
WITH JUDGE JUSTICE."

00:23.556 --> 00:27.527
TONIGHT'S TOP STORY, IS THE
PRESIDENT DEAD?
POLITICALLY, YES.

00:27.527 --> 00:42.042
OTHERWISE, I'M TOLD HE'S FINE.
BUT FIRST THE JACK VEEN GUS TAP
POE IS AT IT AGAIN.

00:42.042 --> 00:44.210
SICKY-NIKKI'S AND FAUCI-OUCHIES
UNTIL ALL OF US YELL HEIL BIDEN
AND JOIN THEIR ZOMBIE ARMY OF

00:44.210 --> 00:46.279
THE VAXXED.
OUR FIRST GUEST IS AN AMERICAN
BRAVE ENOUGH TO STAND AND UP

00:46.279 --> 00:53.887
SAY, "SCREW YOU, SCIENCE, I KNOW
JOE ROGAN!"
PLEASE WELCOME NFL MVP, MOST

00:53.887 --> 01:05.065
AARON RODGERS.
>> HEY.
IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE.

01:05.065 --> 01:11.838
REMEMBER WHEN I HOSTED
"JEOPARDY."
>> NOW, AARON, CAN YOU BELIEVE

01:11.838 --> 01:19.312
YOU'RE NOT VACCINATED.
IT'S YOUR BODY AND YOUR COVID.
PLEASE DON'T USE THAT FOR ANY

01:19.312 --> 01:26.219
OTHER ISSUES.
>> SUDDEN THE WOKE MOB IS COMING
AFTER ME.

01:26.219 --> 01:36.863
IT'S GOTTEN SO BAD, STATE FARM
CALLED AND THEY'RE NOT GIVING ME
THE AARON RODGERS BREAK.

01:36.863 --> 01:42.902
>> STRAIGHT TALK.
>> I GOT ALL THEIR FACES THREE
INCHES AWAY FROM MY WET MOUTH

01:42.902 --> 01:48.375
AND TOLD THEM, TRUST ME.
I'M MORE OR LESS IMMUNIZED.
>> YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T GET THE

01:48.375 --> 01:54.280
VACCINE BECAUSE IT MIGHT MAKE
YOU STERILE, WHICH IS SO INSANE,
I'M JEALOUS I DIDN'T SAY IT.

01:54.280 --> 02:00.653
>> AT THE END OF THE DAY, MY
RECORD IS STILL 7-1.
MEANING OF THE 8 PEOPLE I HAVE

02:00.653 --> 02:07.660
INFECTED, SEVEN ARE FINE.
>> WOW!
CALL THIS GUY THE BOTTOM OF THE

02:07.660 --> 02:12.966
SNAPPLE CAP BECAUSE SHE'S GOT
FACTS.
MY NEXT GUEST TURNED VIRGINIA AS

02:12.966 --> 02:15.535
RED AS MY FACE GETS WHEN I TALK
ABOUT NEARLY ANY SUBJECT.
PLEASE WELCOME GOVERNOR-ELECT,

02:15.535 --> 02:22.242
GLENN YOUNGKIN.
[ APPLAUSE ]
>> JUDGE JEANINE, THANK YOU SO

02:22.242 --> 02:31.117
MUCH FOR HAVING ME.
MY WIN IN VIRGINIA PROVES THAT
PEOPLE ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED

02:31.117 --> 02:35.488
ABOUT EDUCATION.
>> AND WHO ARE MOST OF YOUR
VOTES?

02:35.488 --> 02:36.923
>> PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T GO TO
COLLEGE.
>> EXCELLENT.

02:36.923 --> 02:38.825
NOW, CRITICAL RACE THEORY IS
SOMETHING YOU TALKED ABOUT A
LOT.

02:38.825 --> 02:45.465
WHAT IS CRITICAL RACE THEORY?
>> IT'S SIMPLE.
IT'S WHAT GOT ME ELECTED.

02:45.465 --> 02:50.970
>> RIGHT.
BUT WHAT IS IT?
>> IT'S NOT IMPORTANT, YOU KNOW?

02:50.970 --> 02:55.108
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS PARENTS.
EVERYONE KNOWS THEY SHOULD RUN
SCHOOLS.

02:55.108 --> 03:03.516
THAT'S WHY I INVITED.
>> HELLO.
I'M A HUGE FAN OF YOUR JUDGING

03:03.516 --> 03:11.925
AND YOUR TALKING.
>> OH.
I LIKE THIS ONE ALREADY.

03:11.925 --> 03:14.060
HELEN, WHAT ARE YOUR FEELINGS ON
EDUCATION?
>> WHEN MY SON BROUGHT HOME THE

03:14.060 --> 03:17.630
BOOK "BELOVED" BY TONI MORRISON,
I PUT DOWN MY COPY OF "FIFTY
SHADES" AND SAID, "NO!

03:17.630 --> 03:22.369
A WOMAN NAMED TONI, NOT IN MY
AMERICA."
SO A GROUP OF PARENTS AND I PUT

03:22.369 --> 03:26.072
TOGETHER OUR LIST OF BOOKS THAT
SHOULD NEVER BE ALLOWED IN THE
CLASSROOM.

03:26.072 --> 03:31.211
"HOLES."
SOUNDS SEXUAL.
"PRIDE AND PREJUDICE."

03:31.211 --> 03:38.518
PREJUDICE IS FINE, BUT PRIDE IS
A TERM THAT HAS BEEN CO-OPTED BY
THE GAYS FOR SOME SORT OF

03:38.518 --> 03:45.425
LADY GAGA-THEMED NUDITY.
"INVISIBLE MAN."
WHAT'S HE DOING?

03:45.425 --> 03:47.394
WHERE IS HE?
CAN HE SEE ME IN MY HOME OR WHAT
I GOOGLE?

03:47.394 --> 03:51.931
"THE GREAT GATSBY."
TOO MUCH JAZZ.
AND "MOBY DICK."

03:51.931 --> 03:57.637
NOW, THAT ONE'S A TOSS-UP.
TITLE IS DIRTY, LOVE THAT THE
WHALE IS WHITE.

03:57.637 --> 04:19.759
GET HIM TO SEAWORLD, STAT.
>> YEAH.
SEE, YOU KNOW, I AM SO GRATEFUL

04:19.759 --> 04:26.466
>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I JUST WANTED TO CONGRATULATION

04:26.466 --> 04:30.970
GLENN YOUNGKIN AND MOSTLY MYSELF
ON A TREMENDOUS WIN IN VIRGINIA.
WE DID IT TOGETHER.

04:30.970 --> 04:37.077
>> OH, YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY
THAT.
MR. PRESIDENT, WHAT AN

04:37.077 --> 04:43.316
UNEXPECTED AND FRANKLY HORNY
SURPRISE.
>> IT IS GREAT TO BE HERE JUDGE

04:43.316 --> 04:46.252
JUDY.
AND IT'S GREAT TO BE WINNING
AGAIN.

04:46.252 --> 04:52.459
>> YOU WILL SEE A LOT MORE
WINNING WHERE THAT CAME FROM.
>> OH, YOU CAN TAKE ME OFF THE

04:52.459 --> 04:56.396
SPLIT SCREEN.
>> NO, WE DID THIS TOGETHER.
I REALLY WANT YOU TO STAY.

04:56.396 --> 04:59.332
>> REALLY.
THAT'S OKAY.
>> EXCUSE ME.

04:59.332 --> 05:09.876
EXCUSE ME.
EXCUSE ME.
HE'S SOMEONE THAT TAKES ADVICE

05:09.876 --> 05:13.480
SO WELL.
CAN I GET 60 SECONDS ON THE
CLOCK, PLEASE?

05:13.480 --> 05:18.785
BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT OF TIMES
WHEN I WAS GIVING ADVICE AND
PEOPLE WEREN'T LISTENING AND IT

05:18.785 --> 05:24.290
DIDN'T WORK OUT SO GREAT FOR
SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE, OKAY?
WHEN YOU LOOK BACK WITH STAR

05:24.290 --> 05:29.362
WARS, I SAID, YOU NEED TO DO IT
WITH SWORDS.
THE LASERS ARE NOT ENOUGH.

05:29.362 --> 05:34.067
I SAID THIS TO GEORGE.
I SAID, IF YOU ARE GOING TO DO
STAR WARS, OKAY, YOU HAVE TO

05:34.067 --> 05:43.843
HAVE REAL SWORDS.
AND LOOK AT WHAT THEY'RE DOING
WITH NOON.

05:43.843 --> 05:45.945
AND LOOK WHAT THEY'RE DOING WITH
"DUNE."
OKAY, I'VE TALKED TO

05:45.945 --> 05:48.081
DENIS VILLENEUVE.
I SAID TO HIM, "IF YOU'RE GOING
TO DO A 'STAR WARS,' YOU'RE

05:48.081 --> 05:50.250
GOING TO NEED REAL SWORDS, OKAY?
YOU NEED REAL SWORDS."
AND LOOK AT THE SUCCESS OF

05:50.250 --> 05:52.719
"DUNE."
LOOK AT CHALAMET, LOOK AT ALL OF
IT, LOOK AT THE WHOLE THING.

05:52.719 --> 05:54.988
FRANKLY, WITH "DUNE," YOU'VE GOT
MOMOA, AND EVERYONE'S DOING
FLIPS, AND IT'S VERY "GAME OF

05:54.988 --> 05:56.923
THRONES."
OKAY?
AND PEOPLE WERE VERY

05:56.923 --> 05:58.958
DISAPPOINTED WITH "GAME OF
THRONES," YOU KNOW, HOW IT
ENDED.

05:58.958 --> 06:01.594
THEY DIDN'T LIKE THE ENDING TOO
MUCH, OKAY?
BUT WITH "DUNE," YOU HAVE A LOT

06:01.594 --> 06:04.698
OF POSSIB -- I SEE A LOT OF
POSSIBILITY WITH "DUNE."
THEY'RE GOING TO DO 3, 4, 5,

06:04.698 --> 06:10.804
15 MOVIES.
AND, FRANKLY, I SEE A LOT OF
POSSIBILITY WITH VIRGINIA.

06:10.804 --> 06:18.044
>> YOU ARE IMPRESSIVE.
HOW DO YOU KEEP THAT
ALL IN YOUR BRAIN?

06:18.044 --> 06:20.113
>> WELL, I HAD MY EARS SEALED SO
NOTHING COMES IN OR OUT,
NOTHING.

06:20.113 --> 06:26.319
>> AND MR. PRESIDENT, YOU NEVER
ACTUALLY CAMPAIGNED WITH
GLENN YOUNGKIN, DID YOU?

06:26.319 --> 06:28.221
>> WELL, NO.
I
NEVER DID, I NEVER DID -- GLENN,

06:28.221 --> 06:30.323
GLENN, GLENN, GLENN, GLENN,
DON'T YOU DARE.
DON'T YOU DARE.

06:30.323 --> 06:33.960
DON'T YOU DARE, GLENN.
YOU NEED TO HEAR THIS.
I WAS NEVER THERE, THERE.

06:33.960 --> 06:41.601
OKAY?
I WAS NEVER THERE, THERE.
BUT I TOLD LOTS OF PEOPLE THEY

06:41.601 --> 06:48.875
SHOULD VOTE FOR GLENN.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
MOST PEOPLE DON'T LIKE HIM.

06:48.875 --> 06:50.877
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, MOST PEOPLE
DON'T LIKE GLENN, BUT HE'S --
HE'S A WONDERFUL GUY.

06:50.877 --> 06:52.912
HE'S A WONDERFUL GUY.
HE'S TALL, HE'S RICH.
LIKE MY SONS, GLENN.

06:52.912 --> 06:57.484
YOU'RE LIKE MY SON, OKAY?
>> PLEASE DON'T SAY THAT.
>> WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT, HE'S A

06:57.484 --> 07:05.425
WONDERFUL GUY.
BUT THESE PC FOLKS, THEY DON'T
LIKE HIM, THEY DON'T LIKE HIM AT

07:05.425 --> 07:06.860
ALL.
CAN I GET 60 MORE SECONDS ON THE
CLOCK, PLEASE?

07:06.860 --> 07:10.130
ALL RIGHT, 'CAUSE THESE PC
FOLKS -- THESE PC FOLKS, THEY
DON'T LIKE CHRIS PRATT AS MARIO.

07:10.130 --> 07:16.870
YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M VERY CLOSE
WITH MARIO.
WE'RE VERY CLOSE WITH MARIO.

07:16.870 --> 07:22.375
VERY CLOSE WITH LUIGI.
WE PLAY GOLF TOGETHER.
YOU KNOW, OUR WIVES PLAY GOLF

07:22.375 --> 07:24.044
TOGETHER.
PEACH IS A VERY GOOD FRIEND OF
MINE.

07:24.044 --> 07:26.646
WE'RE VERY CLOSE WITH PEACH.
AND, WITH THE TOADS, BY THE WAY,
I DID SO GREAT WITH THE TOADS.

07:26.646 --> 07:29.249
OKAY?
I DID SO GREAT WITH TOADS.
WE DO GREAT WITH TOADS.

07:29.249 --> 07:36.556
YOU KNOW THE LITTLE MUSHROOM
PEOPLE, A LOT OF THEM CAME OUT
THE LAST ELECTION.

07:36.556 --> 07:38.491
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
THE TOADS LOVE CHRIS PRATT,
OKAY?

07:38.491 --> 07:46.833
AND HIS MARIO IS GOING TO DO A
LOT BETTER THAN THAT -- OH GOD,
IT WAS SO AWFUL, THAT "ETERNALS"

07:46.833 --> 07:48.902
YOU KNOW WHAT, IT'S TOO DIVERSE
AND NO ONE WANTS TO SEE THAT,
OKAY?

07:48.902 --> 07:53.073
THAT MOVIE'S ROTTEN.
IT'S ROTTEN, JUST ASK THE
TOMATOES, OKAY?

07:53.073 --> 07:59.846
YOU CAN ASK THE TOMATOES.
BECAUSE OF THIS AWFUL
SHIPPING NIGHTMARE WE'VE GOT

07:59.846 --> 08:02.615
WITH SLOW JOE.
WE'VE GOT AN AWFUL SHIPPING
NIGHTMARE.

08:02.615 --> 08:07.320
YOU KNOW, THIS IS TRUE, OKAY?
THIS IS TRUE.
A GUY CAME UP TO ME THE OTHER

08:07.320 --> 08:16.096
DAY, BIG GUY, TEARS IN HIS EYES,
AND HE SAYS, "SIR, MY NAME IS
SANTA CLAUS."

08:16.096 --> 08:21.501
CHRISTMAS IS CANCELED.
CHRISTMAS IS CANCELED, SIR.
AND I SAID, "WE CAN'T LET THAT

08:21.501 --> 08:26.773
HAPPEN, SANTA.
AND THAT'S WHY I ASKED HIM TO
GIVE VIRGINIA TO GLENN YOUNGKIN.

08:26.773 --> 08:31.711
I ASKED HIM TO GIVE YOU
VIRGINIA.
WE DID IT.

08:31.711 --> 08:36.583
WE DID IT TOGETHER BECAUSE IT'S
A GREAT COUNTRY.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, SANTA DID IT,

08:36.583 --> 08:38.418
SANTA DID IT, BECAUSE HE LOVES
AMERICA AND HE LOVES TRUMP.
RIGHT, GLENN?

08:38.418 --> 08:44.057
>> WOW.
MR. PRESIDENT, YOU HIT ALL THE
TOPICS I WANTED TO HEAR ABOUT.

08:44.057 --> 08:49.396
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!
**

08:49.396 --> 08:53.833
**
>> Announcer: IT'S "SATURDAY
NIGHT LIVE" WITH --

10:50.216 --> 11:00.660
AND YOUR HOST --
KIERAN CULKIN!
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

11:00.660 --> 11:25.118
KIERAN CULKIN!
[ APPLAUSE ]
>>> THANK YOU.

11:25.118 --> 11:31.825
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
SO HAPPY TO BE HERE RIGHT NOW.

11:31.825 --> 11:38.164
I'M KIERAN CULKIN.
FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS I'VE BEEN
WORKING ON A SHOW

11:38.164 --> 11:43.870
CALLED "SUCCESSION."
I PLAY ONE OF THE NICER
CHARACTERS ON THE SHOW, WHICH

11:43.870 --> 11:50.810
STILL MAKES HIM ONE OF THE TOP
TEN WORST HUMANS ON TV.
SOMETIMES PEOPLE WILL BE LIKE,

11:50.810 --> 11:56.516
YOU KNOW, THAT PART REALLY SUITS
YOU.
WHICH ISN'T REALLY A COMPLIMENT.

11:56.516 --> 12:06.292
IT IS SORT OF LIKE GOING UP TO
SOMEONE SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT
ROLE WOULD FIT YOU LIKE A GLOVE?

12:06.292 --> 12:07.660
GIULIANI.
OH.
MY.

12:07.660 --> 12:15.235
BUT IT'S BEEN A BIG YEAR.
MY WIFE AND I JUST WELCOMED OUR
SECOND CHILD IN AUGUST.

12:15.235 --> 12:23.176
LOVE BEING A DAD.
IT'S GREAT.
AND I GOT -- I GOT ASKED TO HOST

12:23.176 --> 12:26.546
"SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE."
WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN A DREAM OF
MINE.

12:26.546 --> 12:32.819
AND I'VE GOT TO SAY, MY WIFE HAS
BEEN REALLY SUPPORTIVE AND
WONDERFUL THROUGH THE PROCESS.

12:32.819 --> 12:41.995
BUT I HAVE THIS FEELING THAT
SHE'S BEEN TERRIFIED FOR ME.
JUST REALLY NERVOUS.

12:41.995 --> 12:45.265
JAZZ, WHEREVER YOU ARE -- THERE
YOU ARE.
I JUST WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT

12:45.265 --> 12:48.635
EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE FINE
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT DOESN'T
MATTER.

12:48.635 --> 12:53.139
EVEN IF I DO MESS UP AND, QUOTE,
SHAME THE FAMILY.
THANK YOU.

12:53.139 --> 12:57.110
WE'RE GOING TO BE GREAT.
I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK THAT'S
GOING TO HAPPEN BECAUSE THIS

12:57.110 --> 13:03.316
ISN'T MY FIRST TIME BEING HERE.
I HAVE BEEN ON THIS VERY STAGE.
I WAS ON AN EPISODE OF SNL BACK

13:03.316 --> 13:10.156
WHEN MY BROTHER MAX HOSTED 30
YEARS AGO.
ALMOST TO THE DAY.

13:10.156 --> 13:16.329
I WAS NINE YEARS OLD.
I GOT TO BE IN THREE SKETCHES.
TWO OF WHICH ARE

13:16.329 --> 13:19.165
NON-PROBLEMATIC.
AND AT THE END OF THE SHOW, I
GOT TO BE ON THE STAGE FOR THE

13:19.165 --> 13:25.772
GOOD NIGHTS, AND I THINK WE HAVE
A CLIP.
CAN WE SHOW IT?

13:25.772 --> 13:32.178
SO THERE'S MY BROTHER.
AND THE CAST IS LIFTING HIM UP
ON THEIR SHOULDERS.

13:32.178 --> 13:37.584
AND, BOOM, THERE I AM.
CLEARLY JEALOUS.
THEY'RE PICKING HIM UP, MY

13:37.584 --> 13:40.286
BROTHER'S GOT HIS ARMS UP
VICTORIOUSLY.
I'M DOWN ON THE GROUND LIKE, "ME

13:40.286 --> 13:50.096
WANT UPPIES.
SO CHECK OUT WHAT I DO NEXT.
I ASKED KEVIN NEALON TO PICK ME

13:50.096 --> 14:01.808
UP AND HE GOES, YEAH, OKAY,
SURE.
I JUST START HAMMING IT UP.

14:01.808 --> 14:07.847
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT WAS.
LIKE A DE NIRO IMPRESSION.
I WANTED TO SHOW THAT CLIP FOR

14:07.847 --> 14:11.851
TWO REASONS.
ONE IN THE HOPES THAT SOMEONE
FROM THE CAST WILL PICK ME UP

14:11.851 --> 14:17.824
AGAIN AT THE END OF THE SHOW.
AND, TWO, BECAUSE I HAVE WAITED
30 YEARS TO BE BACK ON THIS

14:17.824 --> 14:22.696
STAGE AND SAY, WE'VE GOT A GREAT
SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT.
ED SHEERAN IS HERE.

14:22.696 --> 14:24.297
ED SHEERAN IS HERE.
STICK AROUND.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

15:41.274 --> 15:43.710
>> YEAH, HELLO?
>> THIS IS A CALL-BACK REQUEST
FROM SPECTRUM CABLE.

15:43.710 --> 15:49.949
PLEASE HOLD FOR A

>> HI, THERE, THIS IS MATHEUS

15:57.190 --> 16:01.027
>> HI.
AND WHAT CAN I HELP YOU
WITH TODAY, MR. HERMAN?

16:01.027 --> 16:03.029
>> I JUST NEED TO CANCEL MY
CABLE.
>> OH, I'M SO SORRY TO HEAR

16:03.029 --> 16:06.032
THAT, MR. HERMAN.
BEFORE WE BEGIN, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO ADD A TELEPHONE LAND LINE TO

16:06.032 --> 16:11.705
YOUR CURRENT PACKAGE FOR $12.99
A MONTH?
>> NO, I'M GOOD.

16:11.705 --> 16:14.307
I JUST NEED TO CANCEL THE CABLE.
I TRIED TO DO IT ONLINE BUT IT
SAID I HAD TO CALL.

16:14.307 --> 16:20.547
>> OF COURSE, MR. HERMAN.
MAY I ASK THE REASON FOR YOUR
CANCELATION?

16:20.547 --> 16:28.922
>> YEAH, MY GIRLFRIEND AND I
BROKE UP AND I'M MOVING OUT.
>> OH, NO, I'M SO SORRY.

16:28.922 --> 16:34.227
I'M SO SORRY YOUR RELATIONSHIP
FELL APART, MR. HERMAN.
MR. HERMAN,

16:34.227 --> 16:36.930
MAY I ASK THE CAUSE OF THE
BREAKUP?
[ LAUGHTER ]

16:36.930 --> 16:39.566
>> NO.
THAT'S PERSONAL.
>> OF COURSE, MR. HERMAN.

16:39.566 --> 16:43.203
PLEASE WRITE DOWN THIS REFERENCE
NUMBER IN CASE WE GET
DISCONNECTED.

16:43.203 --> 16:45.839
DO YOU HAVE A PEN AND PAPER
HANDY?
>> NO.

16:45.839 --> 16:52.912
NOT REALLY.
>> WONDERFUL.
MR. HERMAN,

16:52.912 --> 17:08.194
THE NUMBER IS 7-B AS IN BOY, F
AS IN FIGHT.
G AS IN 5G.

17:08.194 --> 17:10.230
PLEASE HOLD FOR A CANCELLATION
AGENT.
>> YOUR CALL IS IMPORTANT TO US

17:10.230 --> 17:12.832
AND WILL BE ANSWERED IN THE
ORDER THAT WE FEEL LIKE.
[ LAUGHTER ]

17:12.832 --> 17:18.571
>> HI, THIS IS TANYA.
FOR SECURITY PURPOSES, CAN YOU
TELL ME THE 42-DIGIT CUSTOMER

17:18.571 --> 17:22.242
PIN NUMBER THAT CAME ON YOUR
FIRST BILL?
[ LAUGHTER ]

17:22.242 --> 17:25.345
>> ON MY FIRST BILL, THE ONE I
GOT SIX YEARS AGO?
I DON'T HAVE THAT.

17:25.345 --> 17:29.516
>> NOT A PROBLEM.
WE CAN USE ONE OF YOUR SECURITY
QUESTIONS.

17:29.516 --> 17:34.220
WHAT CITY DID YOUR MOM LOSE HER
VIRGINITY IN?
[ LAUGHTER ]

17:34.220 --> 17:39.526
>> THAT'S DISGUSTING.
I DON'T THINK I WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THAT.

17:39.526 --> 17:42.562
>> WELL, AND THAT IS WHAT YOU
ANSWERED.
OKAY.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.698
ALL RIGHT, SO WHEN IS A GOOD
TIME FOR A SPECTRUM TECHNICIAN
TO COME INSTALL YOUR NEW LAND

17:44.698 --> 17:48.501
LINE?
>> NEVER.
I DON'T WANT A LAND LINE, OKAY?

17:48.501 --> 17:52.172
I WANT TO CANCEL MY CABLE.
>> OF COURSE.
SO I WILL TRANSFER YOU TO

17:52.172 --> 17:55.809
CANCELATIONS.
I'VE BEEN TONYA.

17:55.809 --> 17:59.479
>> WI-FI TROUBLE?
TRY UNPLUGGING YOUR ROUTER AND
SPITTING IN IT.

17:59.479 --> 18:05.218
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> THIS IS DONNA WITH SPECTRUM.
JUST TO CONFIRM, IT SAYS HERE

18:05.218 --> 18:08.855

>> OH!
>> THAT WAS MEAN AS HECK.

34:36.443 --> 34:43.116
I REALLY LIKE THAT GUY.
AND WHY AM I TALKING SO LOUD?
IN THE MEN'S ROOM, MY VOICE GETS

34:43.116 --> 34:47.954
WEIRD AND I SHOUT THINGS LIKE,
FOOTBALL IS CRAZY!
>> MY HEART IS POUNDING.

34:47.954 --> 34:54.327
WHY DID I CHOOSE THE URINAL
RIGHT NEXT TO HIM?
OUR ARM SKIN IS TOUCHING.

34:54.327 --> 34:58.365
>> HA HA!
>> HA HA!
>> HEY, SEE YOU ON THE ICE!

34:58.365 --> 35:11.311
>> OKAY, YOU TOO.
>> SEE YOU ON THE ICE?
WE WORK AT A PENSION FUND.

35:11.311 --> 35:13.179
IS THAT EVEN AN EXPRESSION?
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO I AM IN
HERE.

35:13.179 --> 35:15.415
>> I'VE BEEN STAND HERE FOR SO
LONG.
NONE OF THE AUTOMATIC SINKS

35:15.415 --> 35:21.521
WORK.
MY HANDS ARE COVERED IN SOAP!
>> I'M STANDING AT A URINAL, I

35:21.521 --> 35:30.630
ONLY CAME IN TO AVOID WORKING.
I CAN'T LEAVE UNTIL THEY HEAR ME
PEE.

35:30.630 --> 35:33.500
I GUESS
I'LL SQUIRT HAND SANITIZER IN TO
FAKE IT.

35:33.500 --> 35:40.807
>> SOUNDS LIKE YOUR STREAM IS
COMING ALONG REALLY WELL.
WHY AM I COMMENTING ON HIS PEE?

35:40.807 --> 35:52.919
CALLING IT A STREAM?
>> HEY!
WHAT'S UP MY DUDES?

35:52.919 --> 35:57.424
WELL, ANYONE GOT BIG PLANS FOR
THE SUMMERTIME?
>> OH -- NOT YET.

35:57.424 --> 36:00.093
>> WHY WOULD THEY?
IT'S NOVEMBER.
WE'RE MONTHS AWAY FROM THE

36:00.093 --> 36:06.933
SUMMERTIME.
HEY, NEW GUY!
DO ANYTHING FUN LAST WEEKEND?

36:06.933 --> 36:09.169
>> SORRY, ME?
>> OH, YEAH.
>> SORRY, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

36:09.169 --> 36:14.908
>> I ASKED IF YOU DID ANYTHING
FUN THIS WEEKEND.
>> OH -- I'M TAKING WAY TOO LONG

36:14.908 --> 36:19.579
TO ANSWER.
MAYBE I'LL PRETEND I DIDN'T
HEAR.

36:19.579 --> 36:25.385
SORRY, I CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING
TODAY.
SO YEAH.

36:25.385 --> 36:27.087
>> WHAT'S THAT?
>> NOTHING, SORRY.
ANYWAY, ARE THESE SINKS WORKING

36:27.087 --> 36:29.222
FOR YOU?
>> NO, BUT FOOTBALL IS CRAZY!
>> YEAH.

36:29.222 --> 36:36.730
>> SO CRAZY.
>> CRAZY.
>> OH-OH, Y'ALL HAVING A LITTLE

36:36.730 --> 36:39.366
SLUMBER PARTY IN HERE?
>> HA HA!
>> I'M JUST YANKING YOUR CHAINS.

36:39.366 --> 36:47.474
HEY, YOU GUYS SEE THAT NEW
RECEPTIONIST?
SHE'S GOT LEGS FOR DAYS.

36:47.474 --> 36:53.213
I KILLED A MAN IN 2012.
I DIDN'T EVEN DO A GOOD JOB
HIDING THE BODY.

36:53.213 --> 36:58.952
BUT I STILL GOT AWAY WITH IT.
ALTHOUGH I'M A FREE MAN, THE
GUILT I CARRY IS WORSE THAN ANY

36:58.952 --> 37:07.293
CELL.
BUT IN HERE, I FORGET WHO I AM
AND WHAT I'VE DONE.

37:07.293 --> 37:30.450
I LOVE THE MEN'S ROOM.
DON'T YOU GUYS LOVE IT IN HERE?
>> OH, YEAH.

37:30.450 --> 37:38.425
>> I DROPPED A BOMB.
AND THIS DUDE KILLED MY BROTHER!
>> OH, YEAH.

37:38.425 --> 37:46.533
AND THIS DUDE KILLED MY BROTHER!
>> OH, YEAH.
WHAT CAN I SAY?

37:50.837 --> 37:54.074
>> RIDE A HORSE?
AFRAID NOT, SON, THIS MAN'S LEG
IS BROKEN IN SIX PLACES.

37:54.074 --> 37:59.079
>> WONDERFUL.
WHERE AM I GOING TO FIND ANOTHER
JOCKEY TEN MINUTES BEFORE THE

37:59.079 --> 38:07.053
KENTUCKY DERBY?
>> I THINK I MIGHT KNOW SOMEONE,
SIR.

38:07.053 --> 38:22.268
>> WHO?
>> SOMEONE GREAT.
>> WHERE IS HE?

38:22.268 --> 38:35.315
>> BELIEVE ME, SIR, YOU'LL KNOW
HIM WHEN YOU SEE HIM.
>> YAH, YAH!

38:35.315 --> 38:45.725
>> WHAT THE HECK?
**
>> YEP, THAT'S ME.

38:45.725 --> 38:48.061
RIDING A HORSE LIKE A
SKATEBOARD.
YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING HOW I

38:48.061 --> 38:51.464
WOUND UP HERE.
WELL, IT'S KIND OF A CRAZY
STORY.

38:51.464 --> 38:56.670
AND IT GOES A LITTLE SOMETHING
LIKE THIS.
* SO THERE I WAS DOING SKATE

38:56.670 --> 39:03.009
TRICKS AT THE PARK *
* THEN I JUMPED WITH TOO MUCH
FORCE AND I LANDED ON A HORSE *

39:03.009 --> 39:09.215
>> GREAT SCOTT!
* IF I LEAN RIGHT OR LEFT HE'D
FOLLOW MY EVERY MOVE *

39:09.215 --> 39:17.023
* AND IF I WANTED HIM TO GO
FASTER I JUST GIVE HIM A BAG OF
CHIPS *

39:17.023 --> 39:25.365
* WE WERE RUNNING REALLY HARD IN
MY NEIGHBOR'S BACKYARD *
>> NOT MY AZALEAS!

39:25.365 --> 39:32.138
* HE CAN DO AN OLLIE AND A BACK
SIDE 182 *
* AND IF I ASK HIM NICELY HE'D

39:32.138 --> 39:37.344
DO A KICK FLIP *
>> THIS GUY IS CRAZY!
* THEN WE WENT TO A TRACK AND WE

39:37.344 --> 39:47.253
WON OUR VERY FIRST RACE *
* BUT AFTERWARDS HE DIDN'T STOP
SO WE TOURED THE UNITED STATES *

39:47.253 --> 39:58.732
* I HOLD ON TO HIS TAIL WHEN WE
GRIND ON A RAIL *
**

39:58.732 --> 40:07.073
* THIS IS OUR LAST RACE CAN'T
BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE END *
* NEXT WEEK I HAVE TO GO TO

40:07.073 --> 40:13.847
COLLEGE AND THEY SAY I CAN'T
BRING MY FRIEND *
* IT'S GONNA BE LONELY, I DON'T

40:13.847 --> 40:23.757
KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO *
* I HOPE THAT WHEN I'M GONE THEY
DON'T TURN HIM INTO GLUE *

40:23.757 --> 40:35.468
>> WHOA!
>> HEY, I THINK I'M OKAY --
>> YEP, THAT PRETTY MUCH SUMS IT

40:35.468 --> 40:38.371
UP.
THAT'S HOW I WON THE KENTUCKY
DERBY.

40:38.371 --> 40:42.742
WOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT?
THEY EVEN MADE A VIDEO GAME
ABOUT MY LIFE, TOBY BIRD PRO

40:42.742 --> 40:46.179
JOCKEY.
NOT BAD FOR A GUY THAT DIED
LATER THAT DAY.

40:46.179 --> 40:53.453
NOT BAD FOR A GUY THAT DIED
LATER THAT DAY.
NOT BAD AT ALL.

42:10.397 --> 42:12.098
>>> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
ED SHEERAN!

42:12.098 --> 42:21.975

45:59.793 --> 46:10.770
COLIN JOST AND MICHAEL CHE.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
GOOD EVENING.

46:10.770 --> 46:12.572
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> WELCOME TO "WEEKEND UPDATE,"
I'M MICHAEL CHE.

46:12.572 --> 46:26.619
>> I'M COLIN JOST.
OUR TOP STORY TONIGHT LIKE IT'S
BEEN FOREVER, INFRASTRUCTURE.

46:26.619 --> 46:34.060
IT SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO CLEAN AS
MANY AS TWO LA GUARD YEAH
BATHROOMS.

46:34.060 --> 46:36.229
INFRASTRUCTURE BILL WILL EXPAND
INTERNET ACCESS ACROSS THE U.S.,
WHICH IS GREAT USE BECAUSE WHEN

46:36.229 --> 46:40.433
HAS MORE INTERNET EVER BEEN BAD
FOR AMERICA?
>>> DEMOCRAT TERRY McAULIFFE

46:40.433 --> 46:44.604
LOST TO REPUBLICAN
GLENN YOUNGKIN IN THE VIRGINIA
GOVERNOR'S RACE.

46:44.604 --> 46:52.412
ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, LOSERS FROM
VIRGINIA GET A STATUE.
POLITICAL EXPERTS SAY THAT THE

46:52.412 --> 46:57.117
REPUBLICAN VICTORY IN VIRGINIA'S
GOVERNOR'S RACE WAS FUELED BY
SUPPORT FROM WHITE WOMEN WHO

46:57.117 --> 47:04.924
DIDN'T GO TO COLLEGE, WHICH JUST
SO HAPPENS TO BE THE EXACT GROUP
I TARGET ON TINDER.

47:04.924 --> 47:10.663
>>> IN THE WAKE OF REPUBLICAN
SUCCESS IN THIS WEEK'S
ELECTIONS, HOUSE MINORITY LEADER

47:10.663 --> 47:14.834
KEVIN McCARTHY ANNOUNCED
REPUBLICANS WOULD INTRODUCE A
PARENTS BILL OF RIGHTS WHICH I'M

47:14.834 --> 47:26.312
PRETTY SURE IS JUST A SIGN YOU
CAN BUY AT HOME GOODS.
>>> PFIZER ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAS

47:26.312 --> 47:29.949
DEVELOPED AN ANTIVIRAL PILL THAT
CAN REDUCE HOSPITALIZATION AMONG
COVID PATIENTS BY NEARLY 90%,

47:29.949 --> 47:50.170
AND EVEN BETTER, IT WILL MAKE
YOU HARDER THAN TRIGONOMETRY.
>> DURR IS ALSO THE NEW JERSEY

47:50.170 --> 47:58.978
STATE MOTTO.
WITH HIS VICTORY, ERIC ADAMS
WILL BECOME NEW YORK'S SECOND

47:58.978 --> 48:08.655
BLACK MAYOR.
NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE NEW
YORK MAYOR WHO BLACKED OUT.

48:08.655 --> 48:21.601
WILL NOW RETURN TO HIS PREVIOUS
JOB AS "EMILY IN PARIS" LAWYER.
>>> REPUBLICAN WINSOME SEARS,

48:21.601 --> 48:23.770
SEEN HERE ATTEMPTING SUICIDE BY
COP, WAS ELECTED AS VIRGINIA'S
FIRST BLACK FEMALE LIEUTENANT

48:23.770 --> 48:26.272
GOVERNOR.
BUT THIS IS ACTUALLY A WIN FOR
DEMOCRATS BECAUSE NOTHING WILL

48:26.272 --> 48:32.045
GET REPUBLICANS TO SUPPORT GUN
CONTROL FASTER THAN THIS
PICTURE.

48:32.045 --> 48:34.948
>>> FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS
FILMED DOING THE TOMAHAWK CHOP
AT A WORLD SERIES GAME IN

48:34.948 --> 48:39.853
ATLANTA.
NATIVE AMERICAN GROUPS SAID,
"THEY FOUND IT EXTREMELY

48:39.853 --> 48:42.589
OFFENSIVE TO SEE THEIR CULTURE
ASSOCIATED WITH SOMEONE WHO
CAN'T EVEN RUN A SUCCESSFUL

48:42.589 --> 48:56.069
CASINO."
>>> LAST WEEK, THE RAPPER
ICE CUBE LEFT THE UPCOMING FILM

48:56.069 --> 48:59.806
"OH, HELL NO" AFTER HE REFUSED
TO GET THE VACCINE.
HERE TO COMMENT IS ICE CUBE!

48:59.806 --> 49:09.649
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> SUP, MICHAEL?
KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

49:09.649 --> 49:15.755
GOING THROUGH A GANGSTER LUMBER
JACK PHASE.
>> I CAN TELL.

49:15.755 --> 49:18.425
SO WHY DON'T YOU GET THE
VACCINE, MAN?
>> HEY, LOOK, MAN.

49:18.425 --> 49:21.094
I WOULD JUST RATHER BE MYSELF
THAN TAKE THAT VACCINE LIKE YOU
OTHER 3 BILLION BOZOS.

49:21.094 --> 49:29.135
>> YEAH, THAT'S WHY YOU LOST
THIS MOVIE.
>> NOT MY LOSS.

49:29.135 --> 49:30.904
YOUR LOSS.
"OH, HELL NO" WAS GOING TO
FEATURE THE GREATEST COMEDY DUO

49:30.904 --> 49:40.580
OF ALL TIME.
ICE CUBE, JACK BLACK, PLAYING
CHEMISTRY.

49:40.580 --> 49:42.315
THE COMEDY CHEMISTRY WAS
CRACKLING.
HIGH JINKS.

49:42.315 --> 49:45.685
CHICANERY.
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
TRY AND GUESS WHAT MY CATCH

49:45.685 --> 49:47.654
PHRASE WAS.
>> "OH, HELL, NO?"
>> THAT'S ACTUALLY CORRECT.

49:47.654 --> 49:50.123
BUT BECAUSE OF THIS CRAZY
VACCINE MANDATE, Y'ALL WIL
NEVER GET TO HEAR IT.

49:50.123 --> 49:51.691
>> I MEAN, UNLESS THEY REPLACE
YOU.
>> OH, HELL NO, MAN.

49:51.691 --> 49:54.394
WHO CAN REPLACE ICE CUBE?
>> I DON'T KNOW, TERRY CREWS?
>> THAT'S A GOOD CHOICE.

49:54.394 --> 50:00.033
>> WHAT ABOUT MICHAEL B. JORDAN?
>> MAKES EVEN MORE SENSE.
HEY, BUT THE POINT IS, THIS

50:00.033 --> 50:03.370
VACCINE MANDATE IS COSTING THE
WORLD MY ART.
I HAD A BUNCH OF OTHER PROJECTS

50:03.370 --> 50:09.909
PACKED IN THE PIPE.
CHECK IT OUT, BOZO.
IF YOU LIKE "BARBERSHOP 3:THE

50:09.909 --> 50:19.686
NEXT CUT," YOU WOULD HAVE LOVED
THE SEQUEL, "BARBERSHOP 4: JUST
A LITTLE OFF THE SIDES."

50:19.686 --> 50:28.528
BUT NOW WE CAN'T MAKE IT.
ALSO, WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A
PREQUELL TO THE ORIGINAL

50:28.528 --> 50:31.598
"FRIDAY" MOVIE.
YOU'LL NEVER
GUESS WHAT IT WAS CALLED.

50:31.598 --> 50:33.166
>> "THURSDAY?"
>> THAT'S ACTUALLY CORRECT
AGAIN.

50:33.166 --> 50:35.468
I WAS ALSO GOING TO STAR IN A
NEW M. NIGHT SHYAMALAN CALLED
"UH-OH, TWIST COMING."

50:35.468 --> 50:41.641
THE TWIST IS, THERE AIN'T NO
TWIST.
EVERYBODY WENT HOME, AND THE DAY

50:41.641 --> 50:44.177
WAS A GOOD DAY.
>> IF YOU WANT TO MAKE THESE
MOVIES SO BAD, WHY DON'T YOU

50:44.177 --> 50:48.348
JUST GET VACCINATED?
>> THE BETTER QUESTION IS, WHY
WON'T Y'ALL LET ME MAKE MY

50:48.348 --> 50:52.018
FAVORITE PROJECT FEATURING THE
GREATEST DRAMATIC DUO OF ALL
TIME?

50:52.018 --> 51:04.531
ICE CUBE, MERYL STREEP.
EATING OCTOPUS AND TRAIPSING ALL
AROUND MYKONOS IN "MAMMA MIA 2."

51:04.531 --> 51:11.671
THAT'S RIGHT.
BOTH OF US ROCKING WHITE LINEN
PANTSUITS NO DRAWERS.

51:11.671 --> 51:16.476
>> NO DRAWERS?
HOW MANY MOVIES WERE YOU MAKING?
>> ENOUGH.

51:16.476 --> 51:20.113
THAT'S JUST THE TIP OF THE BERG,
BOZO.
>> AND ON TOP OF ALL OF THAT,

51:20.113 --> 51:23.783
NOW I GOT TO RUN MY BIG
3 BASKETBALL LEAGUE FROM HOME.
>> RIGHT, THAT'S THE LEAGUE YOU

51:23.783 --> 51:30.690
CREATED FOR RETIRED PLAYERS?
>> YEAH, MAN.
AND NOW I CAN'T GO TO THE GAMES.

51:30.690 --> 51:34.227
IT'S NOT THE SAME IF YOU'RE NOT
COURTSIDE, HEARING THEM KNEES
CREAK, AND THEM BACKS CRACK.

51:34.227 --> 51:38.932
I MEAN, WHERE ELSE COULD YOU
WATCH A BUNCH OF BALLERS ON THE
WRONG SIDE OF 40 PLAY A LIGHTLY

51:38.932 --> 51:42.102
COMPETITIVE GAME OF THREE ON
THREE?
>> AT ANY YMCA?

51:42.102 --> 51:47.340
>> INDEED YOU COULD.
INDEED YOU COULD.
>> JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION, WHY

51:47.340 --> 51:54.581
WON'T YOU GET VACCINATED?
>> HEY, BOZO.
I DON'T HAVE TO TELL ANYBODY

51:54.581 --> 51:58.118
ABOUT MY PRIVATE MEDICAL
DECISIONS.
>> SO YOU'RE SCARED OF NEEDLES?

51:58.118 --> 52:00.854
>> HELL, YEAH, I HATE THEM.
>> ICE CUBE, EVERYBODY.
>> HEY, AARON RODGERS, COME PLAY

52:00.854 --> 52:15.201
WITH THE RAIDERS, MAN.
>>> A HIGH SCHOOL PRINCIPAL HAS
APOLOGIZED FOR UNSPORTSMANLIKE

52:15.201 --> 52:21.441
CONDUCT FOR THE FOOTBALL TEAM
AFTER THEY BEAT ANOTHER TEAM
100-0.

52:21.441 --> 52:27.480
APOLOGY ACCEPTED, SAID THE JETS.
IT WAS REPORTED THAT MOTHERS IN
CALIFORNIA ARE TRYING TO PASS ON

52:27.480 --> 52:33.820
COVID VACCINE ANTIBODIES TO
THEIR CHILDREN BY MAKING THEM
SMOOTHIES WITH THEIR BREAST

52:33.820 --> 52:37.123
MILK.
OH, SURE.
BUT WHEN I ASK FOR THAT I GET

52:37.123 --> 52:59.879
ESCORTED OUT OF JAMBA JUICE.
>>> A PHARMACIST WAS FIRED FOR
TRADING DRUGS FOR SEXUAL FAVORS.

52:59.879 --> 53:12.826
WOW.
SO HE'S A PHARMACIST NOW, HUH?
>>> FEMALE PLAYERS CAN WEAR BIKE

53:12.826 --> 53:19.132
SHORTS INSTEAD OF BIKINI BAT
TOMS.
BUT THEY'RE STILL INSISTING THE

53:19.132 --> 53:25.972
REFS USE THIS WHISTLE.
>>> MORE THAN 30,000 PEOPLE WERE
LOCKED INSIDE SHANGHAI

53:25.972 --> 53:29.075
DISNEYLAND AFTER ONE VISITOR
TESTED POSITIVE FOR COVID.
SO, LET THIS BE A LESSON TO ALL

53:29.075 --> 53:32.278
YOU KIDS OUT THERE, IF YOU'RE
NOT MORE CAREFUL ABOUT COVID,
YOU'LL END UP LIVING AT

53:32.278 --> 53:50.864
DISNEYLAND.
NATIONAL IMPOTENCY AWARENESS
MONTH STARTS TUESDAY.

53:50.864 --> 53:58.938
I THOUGHT IT WOULD NEVER COME.
>>> A SQUIRREL APPEARED TO BE
HOLDING HANDS WITH A WOMAN.

53:58.938 --> 54:06.646
GAY MARRIAGE IS A SLIPPERY
SLOPE.
>> PLASTIC SURGEON POSTED A

54:06.646 --> 54:12.352
VIDEO ON TIKTOK CLAIMING THAT
THE RUMOR IS TRUE THAT THE SIZE
OF A PERSON'S NOSE AS A

54:12.352 --> 54:15.388
DIRECTION CONNECTION TO THE SIZE
OF HIS PENIS.
OH.

54:15.388 --> 54:25.899
SO THAT'S WHY KAMILLA IS
SMILING.
>>> THE SUPREME COURT HEARD

54:25.899 --> 54:31.471
ABOUT THE TEXAS LAW THAT
ESSENTIALLY BANS ALL ABORTIONS
AFTER JUST SIX WEEKS.

54:31.471 --> 54:51.458
HERE TO CHEER US UP GOOBER THE
CLOWN WHO HAD AN ABORTION WHEN
SHE WAS 23.

54:51.458 --> 54:53.193
>> HEY, HEY, HEY!
I'M GOOBER THE CLOWN.
>> SO GOOBER, YOU HAD AN

54:53.193 --> 54:55.628
ABORTION WHEN YOU WERE 23?
>> HEY, COLIN, SMELL THIS
FLOWER.

54:55.628 --> 54:58.231
>> YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SQUIRT
ME, ARE YOU?
>> OH, I WOULD NEVER.

54:58.231 --> 55:00.867
>> OKAY.
>> OH, GOTCHA!
I HAD AN ABORTION THE DAY BEFORE

55:00.867 --> 55:03.069
MY 23rd BIRTHDAY.
>> OKAY, SEEMS LIKE YOU DO WANT
TO TALK ABOUT YOUR ABORTION.

55:03.069 --> 55:05.772
>> WELL, ACTUALLY, I REALLY
DON'T.
BUT PEOPLE KEEP BRINGING IT UP,

55:05.772 --> 55:08.141
SO I GOT TO KEEP TALKING ABOUT
FREAKING ABORTION.
IT'S A ROUGH SUBJECT, SO WE'RE

55:08.141 --> 55:14.114
GOING TO DO FUN CLOWN STUFF TO
MAKE IT MORE PALATABLE, WHEE!
HEY, WHO LIKES A BALLOON ANIMAL,

55:14.114 --> 55:16.483
HUH?
WHAT DO YOU WANT, DO YOU WANT A
GIRAFFE?

55:16.483 --> 55:21.688
YEAH?
>> YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS,
EVELYN.

55:21.688 --> 55:26.593
>> GOOBER.
AND I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE TO DO
THIS, BECAUSE MY ABORTION IS MY

55:26.593 --> 55:31.631
PERSONAL CLOWN BUSINESS.
BUT THAT'S ALL PEOPLE IN THIS
COUNTRY WANT TO DISCUSS ALL THE

55:31.631 --> 55:35.301
TIME, EVEN THOUGH CLOWN ABORTION
WAS LEGALIZED IN CLOWN V. WADE
IN 1973.

55:35.301 --> 55:40.473
HERE.
>> CAN YOU STOP SAYING CLOWN
ABORTION?

55:40.473 --> 55:46.980
WHAT THIS IS?
>> IT'S A WORM.
I DON'T KNOW.

55:46.980 --> 55:49.349
DID YOU KNOW 1 IN 3 CLOWNS WILL
HAVE A CLOWN ABORTION IN THEIR
LIFETIME?

55:49.349 --> 55:51.584
YOU DON'T, BECAUSE THEY DON'T
TELL YOU.
THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO TALK

55:51.584 --> 55:55.789
TO OTHER CLOWNS ABOUT IT.
'CAUSE WHEN THEY DO TALK ABOUT
IT, IF YOU WERE A CLOWN WHO

55:55.789 --> 55:59.426
WASN'T A VICTIM OF SOMETHING SAD
LIKE CLOWN-CEST, THEY THINK YOUR
CLOWN ABORTION WASN'T A

55:59.426 --> 56:06.933
RIGHTEOUS CLOWN ABORTION.
I MEAN, WHAT THE DINK IS THAT.
>> I DON'T THINK YOU CAN SAY

56:06.933 --> 56:08.802
THAT WORD ON THE SHOW.
>> WHAT, ABORTION?
>> I GUESS, KIND OF, YEAH.

56:08.802 --> 56:10.236
>> OKAY.
WE'RE HAVING FUN, COLIN.
JUST LAUGH.

56:10.236 --> 56:13.873
PULL MY FINGER.
>> NO, GOOBER.
>> LAUGH, I NEED IT.

56:13.873 --> 56:18.578
I NEED YOU TO LAUGH SO HARD.
LIKE THE WAY I LAUGHED WHEN THE
DOCTOR ASKED IF I GOT PREGNANT

56:18.578 --> 56:23.249
ON THE WAY OVER TO THE CLINIC,
BECAUSE I WASN'T VERY FAR ALONG,
AND THAT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE

56:23.249 --> 56:27.454
JOKES TO THIS DAY.
I LOVE THAT JOKE.
SUCH A GOOD JOKE.

56:27.454 --> 56:32.625
NOT LIKE A FUNNY HA HA JOKE.
BUT LIKE A FUNNY, YOU'RE NOT AN
AWFUL PERSON, AND YOUR LIFE

56:32.625 --> 56:45.672
ISN'T OVER JOKE, THE BEST KIND.
HONKA-HONKA.
AND IN THE WAITING ROOM THEY HAD

56:45.672 --> 56:48.975
A LITTLE GUEST BOOK WHERE ALL
THE CLOWNS COULD WRITE THEIR
CLOWN ABORTION STORY FOR THE

56:48.975 --> 56:54.080
NEXT CLOWN TO READ IT SO SHE
WOULDN'T FEEL SO ALONE.
OH, HOOKAH!

56:54.080 --> 56:57.650
AND THEN, YEARS LATER, YOU'D BE
AT DINNER WITH A BIG GROUP OF
CLOWNS, ONE CLOWN WILL GO OUT ON

56:57.650 --> 57:01.821
A LIMB, AND SAY, "SHE'S HAD AN
ABORTION, AND THEN EIGHT OTHER
CLOWNS AT THE TABLE WILL SAY

57:01.821 --> 57:05.025
THEY'VE HAD AN ABORTION TOO
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW COMMON IT IS.
AND EVERYONE'S EXCITED AND

57:05.025 --> 57:08.628
RELIEVED TO BE TALKING ABOUT IT.
THEN IT'S LIKE "WOW, WE KEPT THE
SECRET SO LONG DESPITE BEING SO

57:08.628 --> 57:16.436
GRATEFUL IT HAPPENED."
HONKA-HONKA!
>> WAIT.

57:16.436 --> 57:23.209
WAIT A SECOND.
ARE CLOWNS REALLY WOMEN?
>> EXCUSE ME?

57:23.209 --> 57:25.812
WOW.
COLIN JOST THINKS ALL WOMEN ARE
CLOWNS.

57:25.812 --> 57:31.551
>> I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
>> HELIUM.
COLIN, HERE'S MY TRUTH.

57:31.551 --> 57:35.722
I KNOW I WOULDN'T BE A CLOWN ON
TV HERE TODAY IF IT WEREN'T FOR
THE ABORTION I HAD THE DAY

57:35.722 --> 57:39.893
BEFORE MY 23rd BIRTHDAY.
CLOWNS HAVE BEEN HELPING EACH
OTHER END THEIR PREGNANCIES

57:39.893 --> 57:43.063
SINCE THE CAVES.
IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN SO IT OUGHT
TO BE SAFE, LEGAL, AND

57:43.063 --> 57:47.600
ACCESSIBLE.
WE WILL
NOT BACK TO THE ALLEY.

57:47.600 --> 57:50.370
THE LAST THING ANYONE WANTS IS A
BUNCH OF DEAD CLOWNS IN A DARK
ALLEY.

57:50.370 --> 57:59.245
>> GOOBER THE CLOWN, EVERYONE.
>> THIS IS "WEEKEND UPDATE."
I'M COLIN JOST.

57:59.245 --> 58:00.246
>> THIS IS "WEEKEND UPDATE."
I'M COLIN JOST.
>> I'M MICHAEL CHE.

58:47.160 --> 58:54.067
>> GOOD MORNING, FOLKS.
>> GOOD MORNING, FOLKS.
SHERMAN BELL ALONGSIDE KATIE

58:54.067 --> 58:56.670
WILLIAMS.
>> COMING UP, WE'LL HEAR FROM
BETH BENNINGTON WHO IS WITH AN

58:56.670 --> 58:59.572
EAGLE SCOUT ON AN IMPORTANT
MISSION.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, KATIE.

58:59.572 --> 59:03.243
THIS IS TED BAXTER.
AND TED, TELL US WHAT WE'RE
DOING DOWN HERE.

59:03.243 --> 59:05.845
>> WELL, MYSELF AND THESE BOY
SCOUTS WILL BE PICKING UP TRASH
AT THE BEACH ALL DAY.

59:05.845 --> 59:10.016
RIGHT, GUYS?
>> YEAH!
>> OH, THAT'S WONDERFUL.

59:10.016 --> 59:13.153
CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR MORE ABOUT
THAT.
>> ME, TOO.

59:13.153 --> 59:18.892
BUT FIRST, LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT
THE WEATHER WITH RILEY COLE.
>> HEY, GUYS.

59:18.892 --> 59:23.063
>> OH MY GOODNESS, RILEY, WHAT
ARE YOU WEARING?
>> WHO'S RILEY?

59:23.063 --> 59:27.901
I'M TURKEY TOM.
>> TURKEY TOM, HE SAYS.
AND LOOK, HE EVEN CHANGED THE

59:27.901 --> 59:32.405
GRAPHIC.
>> AND WHY IS TURKEY TOM
HONORING US WITH HIS PRESENCE

59:32.405 --> 59:37.110
TODAY?
>> WELL, BECAUSE TODAY WAS THE
FIRST DAY THAT THE THERMOMETER

59:37.110 --> 59:41.314
DROPPED BELOW 40, AND YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.
TIME FOR A FALL RAP.

59:41.314 --> 59:49.622
>> OH, BOY, HERE WE GO.
**
* THE LEAVES ARE TURNING ORANGE

59:49.622 --> 59:56.930
THE GRASS IS TURNING BROWN *
* THE WIND IS GETTING COLDER AND
THE *

59:56.930 --> 1:00:02.669
>> THIS IS A RHODE ISLAND
WEATHER ALERT.
A SEVERE STORM IS APPROACHING.

1:00:02.669 --> 1:00:08.375
EVACUATION ORDERS ARE IN PLACE
FOR FLOOD ZONES 1 THROUGH 4.
TAKE ONLY WHAT IS NECESSARY.

1:00:08.375 --> 1:00:16.883
LEAVE ALL PETS BEHIND.
LIFE THREATENING WINDS AND FLOOD
EXPECTED.

1:00:16.883 --> 1:00:24.624
MAY GOD HAVE MERCY ON YOUR
SOULS.
>> OKAY.

1:00:24.624 --> 1:00:31.865
>> OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE A SEVERE
WEATHER SITUATION.
RILEY, HOW DID WE NOT SEE THIS

1:00:31.865 --> 1:00:35.068
STORM COMING?
>> UM -- WELL, UH, YEAH.
I WAS WORKING ON THE RAP ALL

1:00:35.068 --> 1:00:37.103
LAST NIGHT.
YOU KNOW, THE COSTUMES AND THE
LYRICS, THAT KIND OF THING.

1:00:37.103 --> 1:00:39.572
SO I'M A LITTLE BEHIND HERE ON
THE WEATHER REPORT, SO MY BAD.
BUT YEAH I'M SEEING THAT THIS IS

1:00:39.572 --> 1:00:44.077
A BIG ONE.
AND I -- I SHOULD HAVE CAUGHT
IT, I APOLOGIZE.

1:00:44.077 --> 1:00:47.714
>> OKAY, WELL WHY DON'T WE GO TO
COMMERCIAL SO YOU CAN CHANGE
INTO SOMETHING MORE APPROPRIATE.

1:00:47.714 --> 1:00:51.885
>> YOU KNOW, I WOULD LOVE TO.
BUT THE DOPPLER SAYS LANDFALL
COULD BE ANY MINUTE NOW.

1:00:51.885 --> 1:00:59.259
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE RADAR
HERE.
OKAY.

1:00:59.259 --> 1:01:01.895
THIS IS THE BIGGEST NOR'EASTER
THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN.
OKAY.

1:01:01.895 --> 1:01:08.735
SO THERE'S THIS LARGE,
FAST-MOVING STORM.
HERE -- OKAY, YEAH.

1:01:08.735 --> 1:01:14.441
SO -- THE TURKEYS WERE PART OF
THE RAP.
THERE'S A LYRIC ABOUT SAY

1:01:14.441 --> 1:01:19.679
NOVEMBER BECAUSE OF
THANKSGIVING.
>> YOU KNOW THEY DO.

1:01:19.679 --> 1:01:24.517
>> BUT ANYWAY, YOU CAN SEE
BEHIND THE TURKEYS HERE, THE
WIND IS REACHING -- WOW, 190

1:01:24.517 --> 1:01:26.553
MILES AN HOUR.
>> RILEY --
>> THAT IS VERY DANGEROUS.

1:01:26.553 --> 1:01:29.189
>> RILEY --
>> YEAH, YEAH.
>> TAKE THE TURKEY OFF YOUR

1:01:29.189 --> 1:01:34.260
HEAD.
>> KATIE, LET'S BE REASONABLE.
TURKEY TOM.

1:01:34.260 --> 1:01:47.440
>> DON'T CALL HIM THAT.
>> KATIE, PLEASE.
TURKEY TOM, CAN WE BE LOOKING AT

1:01:47.440 --> 1:01:48.975
STRUCTURAL DAMAGE
FROM THESE WINDS?
>> MORE THAN DAMAGE.

1:01:48.975 --> 1:01:54.781
I THINK SHOULD AREAS COULD BE
COMPLETELY FLATTED.
WE SHOULD EXPECT MANY, MANY

1:01:54.781 --> 1:01:57.784
CASUALTIES.
>> JUST TAKE THE TURKEY HAT OFF.
>> BOO!

1:01:57.784 --> 1:01:59.853
>> OKAY, YEAH, MAYBE I SHOULD.
>> OKAY, GREAT.
AND WHILE YOU DO THAT, WE'LL GO

1:01:59.853 --> 1:02:03.523
TO BETH BENNINGTON.
BETH, ANY SIGN OF THIS STORM
DOWN THERE?

1:02:03.523 --> 1:02:11.331

>> OH, WOW.
BETH, WHERE ARE THE BOY SCOUTS?

1:02:11.331 --> 1:02:17.570
>> THE SEA TOOK THEM!
>> OH MY GOD.
OKAY.

1:02:17.570 --> 1:02:20.707
AND RILEY, RILEY, I SEE YOU
STILL HAVE THE TURKEY HEADPIECE
ON?

1:02:20.707 --> 1:02:28.381
>> I DO, YES.
I DECIDED TO KEEP IT ON IN CASE
YOU WANTED TO HEAR THE REST OF

1:02:28.381 --> 1:02:33.420
THE RAP AFTER THE STORM.
>> BOO.
>> NO.

1:02:33.420 --> 1:02:40.093
THAT'S FAIR.
I'M SORRY I LOOK LIKE THIS.
I'M ALSO VERY SORRY I MISSED THE

1:02:40.093 --> 1:02:41.695
STORM.
>> HEY, MAN, IT'S NOT ON YOU.
>> NO, IT ABSOLUTELY IS.

1:02:41.695 --> 1:02:44.197
LET'S GO TO COMMERCIAL SO RILEY
CAN CHANGE.
KEEP IT HERE FOR MORE AS THIS

1:02:44.197 --> 1:02:52.906
DANGEROUS STORM DEVELOPS.
>> AND LATER, WE'LL HEAR THE
LOCAL BOY SCOUT TROOP WHO IS

1:02:52.906 --> 1:02:54.574
>> AND LATER, WE'LL HEAR THE
LOCAL BOY SCOUT TROOP WHO IS

AFRAID TO BE VULNERABLE.

>> JO, THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL.
JUST TELL HER THAT.
>> YEAH, MAN.

1:08:40.820 --> 1:08:49.829
SHE WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE

JUST GIVE HER A CALL, BUDDY.
