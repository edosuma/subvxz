Howdy.

09:16.724 --> 09:18.059
Howdy.

09:34.742 --> 09:38.179
Ma'am, we was wondering
if you might be willing
to move your trailer,

09:38.212 --> 09:41.182
so as we might be able to dig
under it.

09:41.715 --> 09:44.852
-I'm camping here.
-Fair point.

10:00.334 --> 10:02.103
Ma'am, might you be willing
to lodge

10:02.136 --> 10:04.071
at one of the other sites
around the lake

10:04.105 --> 10:07.308
so as we might be able
to dig under this one?

10:07.341 --> 10:08.876
Dig for what?

10:10.978 --> 10:13.881
Well, ma'am, we buried our pops
out back here a few years back

10:13.914 --> 10:16.150
on account of
it's got a real nice view.

10:16.183 --> 10:19.720
But now they built that
and the view ain't so nice
no more.

10:20.921 --> 10:25.126
-So we figured
we ought to move him.
-Fair point.

10:26.694 --> 10:31.232
Thing is,
someone's expecting
to find me at this one.

10:31.932 --> 10:33.934
Campsite seven?

10:33.968 --> 10:35.703
Might you be able
to hazard a guess

10:35.736 --> 10:38.105
as how long you might
be bunking here?

10:40.774 --> 10:43.210
Ain't that the truth?
We'll see you, then.

10:45.179 --> 10:46.313
-Ma'am.
-Ma'am.

10:46.347 --> 10:47.781
Ma'am.

Afternoon.

16:21.516 --> 16:23.116
Thanks.

16:29.089 --> 16:30.692
Well, go ahead. Open it.

16:39.166 --> 16:42.302
-It's a dinner invitation.
-Shh. Go on.

16:50.143 --> 16:53.113
So what do you say?
Got plans?

16:56.584 --> 16:58.218
Maybe, I'm...

16:58.252 --> 17:01.088
We're over there.
Campsite two.

17:06.360 --> 17:07.595
Um...

17:08.863 --> 17:11.131
What can I bring?

17:13.868 --> 17:16.403
She brought me out here
to propose.

17:16.436 --> 17:18.606
It's legal now, you know,
like pot.

17:19.439 --> 17:20.642
It's true.

17:21.375 --> 17:22.777
You say yes?

17:24.646 --> 17:26.548
She ain't asked yet.

17:26.581 --> 17:28.448
Can't find the courage.

17:28.482 --> 17:30.350
It's true, it's all true.

17:31.318 --> 17:35.355
She was supposed to
propose in South Dakota.
The Badlands.

17:35.389 --> 17:39.159
I was.
Beautiful place, really. Lovely.

17:39.192 --> 17:42.262
This trip was supposed
to be a long weekend.

17:42.296 --> 17:44.364
But she chickened out
in South Dakota.

17:44.398 --> 17:46.366
So we just kept driving.

17:46.400 --> 17:47.869
It's been four
and a half weeks now?

17:47.902 --> 17:49.336
That's true.

17:49.369 --> 17:52.674
Nebraska, Montana, Wyoming.

17:52.707 --> 17:54.576
Beautiful there.

17:54.909 --> 17:59.146
-Yellowstone?
-Oh, honey, it was so beautiful.

17:59.681 --> 18:01.849
Aww.

18:03.618 --> 18:07.187
I give thanks for every mile.

18:07.220 --> 18:09.189
But she still ain't proposed.

18:10.324 --> 18:12.225
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

18:30.210 --> 18:34.181
I haven't been to Yellowstone
in like 20 years.

18:35.550 --> 18:38.185
Used to fly bush planes
up there.

18:38.686 --> 18:40.588
Forest Service work.

18:50.598 --> 18:52.600
Marriage, you know?

18:59.574 --> 19:01.441
What do you think I should do?

19:11.552 --> 19:12.754
I don't know.

19:18.458 --> 19:22.897
So, just getting away
from things, Faye, or what?

19:24.732 --> 19:26.366
Kinda, I guess.

19:26.901 --> 19:28.301
You guess?

19:29.403 --> 19:32.372
Well, I'm meeting someone here.

19:32.406 --> 19:34.709
- Supposed to be.
- Ooh!

19:34.742 --> 19:38.345
And who is this someone?

19:40.313 --> 19:42.382
I don't know, really.

19:42.416 --> 19:43.751
Hmm, so true.

19:44.484 --> 19:46.486
That's always how it is.

19:47.655 --> 19:50.323
I mean, I knew him as a kid.

19:51.324 --> 19:53.493
We grew up pretty close to here.

19:54.494 --> 19:59.366
But it's been enough decades
to stand on.

20:01.301 --> 20:02.570
When is he coming?

20:04.872 --> 20:06.741
I don't know, really.

20:08.576 --> 20:11.713
Not even sure
what he looks like anymore.

20:13.748 --> 20:19.620
But he says he has
a small silver car
and a big black dog.

20:22.489 --> 20:26.226
And I told him I'd be
at campsite seven.

20:26.961 --> 20:29.864
Seeing as it's lucky and all.

20:39.372 --> 20:40.407
Well...

20:44.679 --> 20:46.480
To love.

20:59.560 --> 21:01.596
American kestrel.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.401
Mm, terrible bird.

22:26.547 --> 22:27.882
Nope.

23:28.943 --> 23:32.046
Nope.

23:42.489 --> 23:44.926
I'm going home.
It's all yours.

23:45.626 --> 23:47.862
It ain't that, ma'am.

23:47.895 --> 23:50.430
We've got car trouble.

24:12.653 --> 24:14.855
It's not gonna work.

24:27.735 --> 24:30.004
Blew a rod clean through
the block.

24:30.972 --> 24:32.974
Gonna need a new engine.

24:46.120 --> 24:47.555
Well...

24:51.826 --> 24:53.594
I guess you can borrow mine.

25:43.711 --> 25:44.745
Ma'am?

25:47.381 --> 25:49.150
We'd like you to have our canoe.

25:55.656 --> 25:59.794
It'll do you good for recreation
and romantic excursions.

26:08.869 --> 26:09.904
All right.

27:51.038 --> 27:52.273
Howdy.

27:56.511 --> 27:57.878
Howdy.

28:04.451 --> 28:06.153
You know me?

28:08.523 --> 28:10.090
I don't know.

28:11.125 --> 28:12.760
You know me?

28:15.996 --> 28:17.698
I don't know.

28:23.871 --> 28:25.507
-That's Huck.
-She looks...

28:25.540 --> 28:28.275
Just like Maggie, I know.
Um...

28:28.309 --> 28:30.144
Same blood.

28:30.177 --> 28:32.813
Just a few generations
down the line.

28:32.846 --> 28:34.281
Hi there, Huck.

28:35.282 --> 28:36.817
Look at you.

28:37.918 --> 28:39.086
Look at you!

28:47.027 --> 28:48.762
Look at us.

28:52.866 --> 28:55.002
Uh. Uh.

28:55.035 --> 28:57.071
Golden Aster.

28:59.006 --> 29:00.074
Thanks.

29:03.143 --> 29:05.813
Kinda got wilted in the car.

29:23.397 --> 29:26.433
My dad spent summers
up there with the sheep.

29:28.402 --> 29:30.371
That's when we'd see him.

29:31.171 --> 29:36.010
Cold parts of the year they'd
graze down in Utah somewhere.

29:39.847 --> 29:43.917
He was one of the last
Basque Shepherds, probably.

29:44.952 --> 29:46.987
-'Round here at least.
-Hmm.

29:49.189 --> 29:53.561
They used to drive the sheep
down Main Street,
you remember that?

29:54.228 --> 29:56.030
I remember that.

30:35.336 --> 30:38.339
We came here for a field trip.
1970.

30:39.273 --> 30:41.041
Tenth grade.

30:42.242 --> 30:44.178
Rained the whole time.

30:49.016 --> 30:53.354
Betty Bauman
brought a toad home
in her backpack.

30:53.387 --> 30:55.989
Oh, God.

30:56.023 --> 30:57.391
I remember.

31:09.169 --> 31:11.138
You tried to kiss me that day.

31:14.441 --> 31:16.944
You tried to kiss me.

31:18.112 --> 31:19.913
I don't remember that.

31:23.150 --> 31:26.220
-I do.
-Don't remember that.

31:28.122 --> 31:31.325
I remember catching crawdads
that trip.

31:31.358 --> 31:34.662
With, uh, bacon on a string.

31:36.063 --> 31:37.297
Me too.

31:39.601 --> 31:42.136
The water used to go
all the way up there.

31:45.439 --> 31:47.941
Used to rain a lot more.

32:02.557 --> 32:04.258
Tenth grade.

32:06.093 --> 32:09.531
We won the tug of war that year.
Fourth of July.

32:10.164 --> 32:12.399
Carol Brothers
and Big Bessie Dee.

32:13.233 --> 32:14.468
I remember.

32:22.109 --> 32:25.179
- Guess it's a tourist town now.
-Hmm.

32:27.381 --> 32:28.949
I guess.

32:56.410 --> 32:59.079
Hey.

33:03.618 --> 33:05.486
Ah!

33:31.245 --> 33:32.446
There we go.

33:37.150 --> 33:38.352
Here we go.

33:39.119 --> 33:40.555
Take it on home.

33:49.396 --> 33:51.498
Oh, jeez, wait. Oh.

33:55.469 --> 33:58.540
Ah. Ugh.

33:58.573 --> 33:59.707
Well...

34:08.348 --> 34:11.519
You know,
Shirley was the real musician.

34:14.388 --> 34:16.390
Me, I just never, uh...

34:19.359 --> 34:22.630
never could
feel it like she did.

34:26.133 --> 34:28.068
That was...

34:28.903 --> 34:31.238
That was what she did.

34:51.559 --> 34:54.094
Tommy had a band.

34:56.798 --> 35:00.167
They used to play
on Sundays sometimes.

35:01.268 --> 35:04.438
"Church tunes for doomed souls"

35:04.839 --> 35:07.174
they called 'em.

35:10.578 --> 35:12.513
He was a good man.

35:15.415 --> 35:16.551
Yeah.

35:24.424 --> 35:26.259
-Now?
-Go on.

35:26.293 --> 35:27.595
-Now?
-Yeah!

35:27.629 --> 35:30.263
- Now?
- Now!

35:48.883 --> 35:50.652
Come on. It's good.

35:56.557 --> 35:59.560
You think the cabin
I was a kid in is still there?

36:05.733 --> 36:06.901
Hmm.

36:07.835 --> 36:10.237
Think they still
graze sheep round here?

36:20.414 --> 36:21.849
What?

36:21.883 --> 36:24.585
Ah, just some good memories.

36:24.619 --> 36:25.787
I don't know.

36:43.037 --> 36:45.707
Reckon you can still love
something...

36:46.406 --> 36:47.909
that ain't there no more?

36:50.578 --> 36:52.212
I know you can.

36:53.948 --> 36:55.449
Don't you?

37:02.422 --> 37:04.759
I can't tell.

37:13.801 --> 37:15.603
Can I take a photo of you?

37:18.673 --> 37:19.741
Come on.

37:23.477 --> 37:24.846
I'd like to.

37:25.445 --> 37:28.448
No one's taken my photo
for seven years.

37:28.482 --> 37:33.320
Y'all get to remember me
real young and pretty.

37:34.555 --> 37:36.356
I think you're pretty.

37:39.359 --> 37:40.460
I do.

37:46.734 --> 37:49.670
Tell me what to do.

37:50.805 --> 37:53.508
Uh, look back toward the water.

37:53.541 --> 37:57.645
- Come on, come on,
that's it, that's it!

37:59.514 --> 38:02.282
- Okay?
- Okay.

38:03.350 --> 38:05.820
Now slowly toward me.

38:12.459 --> 38:13.895
All right.

38:17.865 --> 38:19.066
How is it?

38:20.134 --> 38:21.769
It's really nice.

38:22.804 --> 38:26.473
-Wanna see?
-No, I don't wanna see.

38:35.750 --> 38:37.518
You still play?

38:38.418 --> 38:39.654
Play what?

38:40.688 --> 38:42.422
Music.

38:46.027 --> 38:47.528
'Course not.

38:48.763 --> 38:50.731
Starts out in G.

38:51.766 --> 38:53.734
And moves to a C.

38:53.768 --> 38:56.804
Uh-oh.
I gotta cheat that one.

38:57.605 --> 38:59.574
-Back to the G.
-G.

38:59.607 --> 39:02.777
Good. And up to a D.

39:02.810 --> 39:04.679
- Yeah, that's it.
- D.

39:04.712 --> 39:07.648
-Back to the C.
-C.

39:07.682 --> 39:09.817
Take it on home to G.

39:10.918 --> 39:13.821
Yeah. And it moves like, uh...

39:20.795 --> 39:21.829

Ah.

45:10.277 --> 45:13.280
Yeah, it's been a while
since, uh...

45:14.248 --> 45:16.183
Yep.

45:22.156 --> 45:25.926
So...
Where do you suppose

45:29.129 --> 45:32.199

45:33.167 --> 45:34.536

45:34.569 --> 45:36.737
Follow me, over here.

45:48.148 --> 45:51.919
Yeah. Door facing the mountain,
I guess. Heh.

45:56.190 --> 45:59.159

Well...

46:33.060 --> 46:38.132
Eh, so long as there's
no wind, rain, heat, or cold,
this should do me pretty good.

46:44.972 --> 46:46.173
Come inside.

47:12.499 --> 47:14.602
Can I offer you a beer?

47:15.135 --> 47:17.004

My grandma...

50:15.182 --> 50:17.585
ate an ice cream cone

50:17.619 --> 50:20.287
and watched a cowboy movie
every night.

50:22.089 --> 50:25.225
-Lived to 101.
-Hmm.

50:27.227 --> 50:30.097
Little Lito,
she used to call me.

50:31.365 --> 50:35.235
Little Lito! I remember.

50:44.378 --> 50:46.113
What do you do, Faye?

50:48.883 --> 50:50.117
Well...

50:53.320 --> 50:55.590
There's days and there's nights.

50:55.623 --> 50:58.191
And I've got a book for each.

51:11.371 --> 51:13.541
When I heard about Tommy,

51:14.341 --> 51:17.545
I wondered if I should,
you know...

51:18.646 --> 51:20.247
call...

51:21.448 --> 51:23.450
go to the service.

51:27.187 --> 51:30.490
But it had been so long.

51:31.626 --> 51:35.429
I haven't seen most
of those people in more than...

51:36.296 --> 51:37.565
forty years.

51:40.267 --> 51:43.605
Taught myself to hate
that place so good.

51:45.940 --> 51:48.408
And then,

51:48.442 --> 51:51.144
seven years after that,

51:51.178 --> 51:52.847
you wrote me a letter.

51:54.247 --> 51:55.717
Why'd you do that?

52:01.756 --> 52:06.728
Those first two years were,
uh...

52:08.328 --> 52:10.197
you know...

52:11.431 --> 52:12.466
hard.

52:14.368 --> 52:17.538
Was too lonely to speak.

52:20.440 --> 52:22.510
I didn't talk to no one.

52:23.611 --> 52:28.448
Lost most of my teeth.

52:35.823 --> 52:39.493
I hadn't known love before,
you know?

52:40.895 --> 52:44.766
And when it came, it was...

52:46.266 --> 52:48.368
just so simple.

52:51.005 --> 52:54.609
I realized what all the songs
were about, you know?

53:01.448 --> 53:03.250
So when he died...

53:05.419 --> 53:08.388
I guess I forgot just as easy.

53:11.526 --> 53:13.528
But I found a way to live.

53:15.663 --> 53:18.700
Still finding it, I guess.

53:21.501 --> 53:23.971
This is my first trip
without him.

53:25.773 --> 53:28.543
Less than a day's drive.

53:34.281 --> 53:37.985
We were good friends,
weren't we, huh?

53:38.019 --> 53:40.521
All those years ago.

53:42.023 --> 53:43.256
Yeah.

53:47.494 --> 53:49.262
I think we were.

53:53.067 --> 53:54.702
You still miss him?

53:57.370 --> 53:58.438
Yeah.

54:00.908 --> 54:04.277
-You still miss her?
-Yeah.

55:41.108 --> 55:44.712
Dwarf rabbitbrush.

56:19.914 --> 56:22.850
I know, I know.

56:36.631 --> 56:38.465
Whip-poor-will.

56:39.033 --> 56:41.836
Long way from home.

57:23.577 --> 57:26.180
I put some more bait
in your trap.

57:30.751 --> 57:31.986
Thanks.

57:36.657 --> 57:39.126
Uh, listen, um,

57:39.160 --> 57:42.730
I gotta thank you,
for all the, you know...

57:43.297 --> 57:47.735
for getting the campsite
and having me out here
and stuff.

57:50.037 --> 57:51.105
Sure.

57:54.842 --> 57:56.510
I think I gotta...

58:03.217 --> 58:04.618
Um...

58:07.788 --> 58:09.824
I think I can't.

58:15.563 --> 58:16.630
Oh.

58:43.124 --> 58:45.893
It held up pretty good
in the end, huh?

58:57.338 --> 58:59.073
Come on, Huck.

59:00.041 --> 59:01.976
Here we go!

59:26.834 --> 59:29.303

dwarf rabbitbrush.

59:31.872 --> 59:33.140
