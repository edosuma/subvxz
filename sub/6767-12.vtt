00:02.168 --> 00:03.920
CHANCELLOR ARNOLD:
<i>Plagiarism</i>

00:04.003 --> 00:06.089
is a very serious charge,
gentlemen.

00:06.172 --> 00:07.799
It speaks to the honor,

00:07.882 --> 00:10.135
as well as the reputation,

00:10.218 --> 00:11.636
of this entire university.

00:11.720 --> 00:14.013
{\an1}Look, I told everyone
over and over

00:14.097 --> 00:16.391
and over again, that
Brandon is innocent.

00:16.474 --> 00:18.601
{\an3}He didn't know I copied
the paper from him.

00:18.685 --> 00:19.978
There is a process
in place, Steve.

00:20.061 --> 00:21.438
We must follow that process.

00:21.521 --> 00:23.022
{\an6}(sighs)
ARNOLD:
The Student Code of Conduct

00:23.106 --> 00:25.400
calls for the appointment
of a tribunal,

00:25.483 --> 00:27.944
and a hearing held
in accordance

00:28.027 --> 00:29.446
with generally accepted
standards

00:29.529 --> 00:31.114
of procedural due process.

00:31.197 --> 00:32.490
{\an3}You may retain
a lawyer.

00:32.573 --> 00:33.783
{\an3}You may choose to
represent yourself.

00:33.867 --> 00:38.121
Professor Randall will
act for the university.

00:38.204 --> 00:41.833
The tribunal will decide
the verdict and the punishment,

00:41.916 --> 00:44.753
which could be... expulsion.

00:44.836 --> 00:47.505
They might as well shoot me now.

00:47.589 --> 00:49.132
{\an1}Well, to be honest,
I'm not sure

00:49.215 --> 00:50.925
you deserve to see
three and a half years

00:51.009 --> 00:51.926
of college
go down the drain.

00:52.010 --> 00:54.471
I thought you said
the tribunal decides that.

00:54.554 --> 00:55.847
{\an3}Only if there's
a hearing.

00:55.930 --> 00:57.474
{\an1}I've reviewed
the bylaws.

00:57.557 --> 00:58.683
{\an1}If you were
to plead guilty,

00:58.767 --> 01:00.143
there would be no hearing,

01:00.226 --> 01:01.770
and discipline
would be my decision.

01:01.853 --> 01:04.022
{\an3}ARNOLD:
Off the record,

01:04.105 --> 01:06.024
it might very well be

01:06.107 --> 01:08.985
more of an academic
probation situation.

01:09.068 --> 01:11.070
{\an3}And all I have to do
is plead guilty?

01:12.071 --> 01:13.948
{\an3}I could do that.
I am guilty.

01:14.032 --> 01:15.158
{\an1}ARNOLD:
Fair enough, then.

01:15.241 --> 01:16.242
{\an1}You and I

01:16.326 --> 01:18.453
will meet separately
to determine your punishment.

01:18.536 --> 01:19.496
Brandon,

01:19.579 --> 01:21.456
what about you?

01:21.539 --> 01:23.333
According to the code,

01:23.416 --> 01:24.667
your giving
the paper to Steve

01:24.751 --> 01:26.002
makes you just as culpable.

01:26.085 --> 01:27.962
The charges against me
are false, sir.

01:28.046 --> 01:29.255
I haven't done anything wrong.

01:29.339 --> 01:30.673
{\an6}Well, Professor Randall
seems to think you did.
I don't care

01:30.757 --> 01:34.135
what Professor Randall
thinks, sir.

01:34.219 --> 01:35.845
I guess it's going to be
up to the tribunal

01:35.929 --> 01:36.846
to decide who's telling
the truth.

01:36.930 --> 01:37.847
I admire your

01:37.931 --> 01:39.516
faith in the truth.

01:39.599 --> 01:42.060
But I warn you to be
very careful here.

01:42.143 --> 01:44.979
Sometimes the truth and justice
are not the same thing.

01:45.063 --> 01:46.481
I can't plead guilty
to something

01:46.564 --> 01:48.149
I haven't done, sir;
I'm sorry.

01:50.401 --> 01:52.529
Then a full hearing

01:52.612 --> 01:55.657
of the Student Conduct Committee
will take place tomorrow

01:55.740 --> 01:57.200
on the charges against you,

01:57.283 --> 02:00.078
{\an1}commencing tomorrow
morning, as scheduled.

02:01.788 --> 02:03.206
I'm very sorry, Brandon.

02:03.289 --> 02:05.416
Yeah. Thanks.

02:12.632 --> 02:14.843
{\an3}Brandon, I don't understand
why you didn't take the deal.

02:14.926 --> 02:16.344
I mean, Randall's
going to fry you.

02:16.427 --> 02:18.555
{\an1}Steve, the last thing I need
right now is your advice.

02:18.638 --> 02:20.431
{\an3}All right, look, I'll
stand up for you, okay?

02:20.515 --> 02:21.724
{\an3}I'll tell them that
you didn't do it.

02:21.808 --> 02:23.184
I don't want you to do anything.

02:23.268 --> 02:24.686
{\an3}You don't want me
to testify for you?

02:24.769 --> 02:26.354
No, I don't want
you to testify for me.

02:26.437 --> 02:27.564
You've done enough already.

02:27.647 --> 02:29.107
{\an3}All right, Brandon,
I screwed up.

02:29.190 --> 02:31.568
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

02:31.651 --> 02:33.152
But we're best friends.

02:34.320 --> 02:36.322
Not anymore.

{\an3}I couldn't even
go two miles.

04:45.785 --> 04:47.328
Well, see what
a couple weeks

04:47.412 --> 04:48.997
{\an1}of hard work
will do for you?

04:49.080 --> 04:50.665
Yeah.

04:50.748 --> 04:52.834
{\an3}You know, I want
to thank you.

04:52.917 --> 04:55.837
I mean, you've been like
a guardian angel to me.

04:55.920 --> 04:57.046
David, you're not getting

04:57.130 --> 04:58.840
all sentimental
on me, are you?

04:58.923 --> 05:00.383
No, really.

05:00.466 --> 05:01.843
Think about it,
come on: Vegas,

05:01.926 --> 05:03.344
{\an3}the hospital,
everything.

05:03.428 --> 05:04.554
(chuckles)

05:04.637 --> 05:06.014
What, this isn't
one of those, uh,

05:06.097 --> 05:07.223
{\an1}nurse-patient
type of things, is it?

05:07.306 --> 05:09.267
{\an1}'Cause if it is,
you know, I can go out

05:09.350 --> 05:10.893
{\an1}and get one of those
uniforms, white stockings...

05:10.977 --> 05:12.270
{\an3}Well, you know, I hadn't
thought about it,

05:12.353 --> 05:13.563
{\an3}but now that
you mention it...

05:13.646 --> 05:14.897
(laughs)
Shut up.

05:14.981 --> 05:17.567
So what do you
say to you, me,

05:17.650 --> 05:18.735
and the Goo Goo Dolls

05:18.818 --> 05:20.111
{\an3}tonight at
the El Rey Theater?

05:20.194 --> 05:21.195
{\an3}I'll pick you
up around 7:00.

05:21.279 --> 05:24.365
{\an1}Ah, hmm, tonight I'm having
dinner with my parents.

05:24.449 --> 05:25.408
{\an1}You know what,
why don't,

05:25.491 --> 05:26.617
why don't you
come with us,

05:26.701 --> 05:28.161
{\an1}and then we can
just go afterwards?

05:29.328 --> 05:30.580
All right.
Cool.

05:30.663 --> 05:31.956
Sounds like a plan.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.499
{\an3}You know, we
better get going.

05:33.583 --> 05:35.251
{\an3}I mean, I've got to get
cleaned up for class.

05:35.334 --> 05:37.462
Oh, yeah, um, could I shower
at your place?

05:37.545 --> 05:39.255
'Cause I have some clothes
in my car.

05:39.338 --> 05:40.757
{\an3}Yeah, sure.
Great.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.759
Oh, and don't forget,
we have got to get Mark

05:42.842 --> 05:44.427
a birthday present
before the surprise party.

05:44.510 --> 05:46.596
Yeah, what's up with that?
You and Kelly have been

05:46.679 --> 05:48.347
plotting like
secret agents or something.

05:48.431 --> 05:51.100
She has to get him out
of the house, and he's not

05:51.184 --> 05:52.685
{\an1}cooperating.
Well, it's not that hard.

05:52.769 --> 05:54.562
He's a dumb guy
just like the rest of us.

05:54.645 --> 05:57.106
{\an1}That's true.
Ah!

05:58.149 --> 06:00.318
But not as lucky as I am.

06:03.571 --> 06:06.074
{\an3}Oh, a four leaf clover.
Yep.

06:06.157 --> 06:08.034
It's for you.

06:13.539 --> 06:15.792
{\an3}Okay, look,
I'll come clean.

06:15.875 --> 06:16.959
I know tomorrow

06:17.043 --> 06:20.004
is your birthday, and I want us
to do something special.

06:20.088 --> 06:21.089
Got any ideas?

06:21.172 --> 06:23.299
You know what I really
want to do on my birthday?

06:23.382 --> 06:24.634
Absolutely nothing.

06:24.717 --> 06:26.260
That's no fun.

06:26.344 --> 06:27.387
Well, we can make it fun.

06:27.470 --> 06:28.638
Come over
and kick up your feet

06:28.721 --> 06:30.098
and share my forbidden passion.

06:31.766 --> 06:32.975
Brandon.

06:34.936 --> 06:36.312
Hey, kids.

06:36.395 --> 06:38.147
{\an3}How's it going with the
chancellor and everything?

06:38.231 --> 06:40.024
{\an5}My hearing's scheduled
for tomorrow.
Well, good luck, man.

06:40.108 --> 06:41.150
You need anything?

06:41.234 --> 06:42.151
No, no, no, I'm cool.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.236
Listen, I'm kind of pressed.

06:43.319 --> 06:44.487
I'll see you guys later.

06:44.570 --> 06:45.780
I'll be right back.

06:46.781 --> 06:48.032
{\an1}Brandon...

06:48.116 --> 06:50.701
{\an1}Hey, I know you've got
to go, but are you going

06:50.785 --> 06:52.370
to be able to make it
to his surprise party?

06:52.453 --> 06:54.247
{\an1}I'll try.
What about Steve?

06:54.330 --> 06:55.248
{\an3}Ask Steve.

06:55.331 --> 06:56.332
{\an1}All right.

06:56.415 --> 06:57.667
{\an1}Is everything
going to be okay?

06:57.750 --> 06:59.085
{\an3}I hope so.

06:59.168 --> 07:00.837
{\an3}Good luck.
Thanks.

07:03.923 --> 07:05.216
What was that all about?

07:05.299 --> 07:06.509
Oh, I was just

07:06.592 --> 07:08.177
asking him what
his sister in England

07:08.261 --> 07:09.220
might want for Christmas.

07:09.303 --> 07:10.680
And then you kissed him.

07:10.763 --> 07:12.765
I was wishing him luck
for his hearing.

07:18.896 --> 07:20.648
CLARE:
All right, so what happened?

07:20.731 --> 07:22.316
{\an1}Well, it's
like you said--

07:22.400 --> 07:23.818
if I plead guilty,

07:23.901 --> 07:25.528
{\an1}your father will
let me stay in school.

07:25.611 --> 07:26.946
What about Brandon?

07:27.029 --> 07:28.489
He didn't take the deal.

07:28.573 --> 07:30.158
{\an1}His hearing's
tomorrow morning.

07:30.241 --> 07:31.826
Ugh. How was he?

07:31.909 --> 07:34.036
Oh, he wasn't
talking to me.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.164
{\an1}He doesn't even want me
to testify for him, either.

07:36.247 --> 07:38.541
So don't.

07:38.624 --> 07:40.668
I'll be testifying anyway.

07:40.751 --> 07:42.003
Randall's calling me

07:42.086 --> 07:43.629
{\an1}as a witness
for the prosecution.

07:43.713 --> 07:45.548
{\an3}Why? I mean, obviously
you're going to say

07:45.631 --> 07:46.674
"Brandon didn't know."

07:46.757 --> 07:47.758
I don't know.

07:47.842 --> 07:50.094
Clare, I don't know
if I can go through with this.

07:50.178 --> 07:53.389
{\an3}Hmm, doesn't look like
you have a choice.

07:53.472 --> 07:55.224
You know what?
I don't feel well.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.351
I think I'm getting sick.

07:58.811 --> 08:00.646
No such luck.

08:03.941 --> 08:05.860
NAT:
<i>Well, like the song</i>

08:05.943 --> 08:08.613
says, Val, "Nothin' from
nothin' leaves nothin'."

08:08.696 --> 08:11.240
{\an1}Nothing's better than
the hole we're in.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.241
{\an3}(sighing):
What about David?

08:12.325 --> 08:13.743
{\an3}You said he

08:13.826 --> 08:15.578
was interested;
is that still a possibility?

08:15.661 --> 08:16.913
I think so.

08:16.996 --> 08:18.247
He hasn't said anything to me.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.124
Well, maybe it's time
you said something.

08:20.208 --> 08:22.293
Look, I better get back

08:22.376 --> 08:24.086
before my other business
goes under.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.338
See ya.

08:30.843 --> 08:33.471
(keypad beeping)

08:33.554 --> 08:34.889
(line ringing)

08:34.972 --> 08:36.432
(phone ringing)

08:36.515 --> 08:38.351
(shower running)

08:40.102 --> 08:41.270
Hello?

08:41.354 --> 08:43.813
Donna, hi, it's Valerie.
Is David there?

08:43.898 --> 08:45.775
Hey, Val-- uh, actually
he's in the shower.

08:45.858 --> 08:46.859
Can I take a message?

08:46.943 --> 08:48.945
Yeah, can you have him call me.
I need to talk to him.

08:49.028 --> 08:50.988
Sure.
Uh, anything important?

08:51.072 --> 08:53.282
Donna, I don't want to be rude,
but it's kind of private.

08:53.366 --> 08:54.492
Just give him
the message, okay?

08:54.575 --> 08:56.244
Well, I would be rude,
Valerie,

08:56.327 --> 08:57.578
but I wasn't
brought up that way.

08:57.662 --> 08:58.871
I'll give him the message.

08:58.955 --> 09:01.332
Hey, who was
on the phone?

09:01.415 --> 09:03.292
Uh, Valerie.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.586
{\an1}Man, I've been
meaning to talk to her.

09:06.712 --> 09:09.131
Um, David,
you know, I just,

09:09.215 --> 09:10.466
I don't think
it's a good idea

09:10.549 --> 09:12.426
for you to put your
money in After Dark.

09:12.510 --> 09:15.596
Well, that's pretty blunt.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.765
Well, I can't help it.

09:17.848 --> 09:20.101
{\an1}I'm worried about you.
Why?

09:20.184 --> 09:21.894
Well, you were sick
when you offered it.

09:21.978 --> 09:23.020
{\an1}No one can
hold you to it.

09:23.104 --> 09:24.981
Donna, you know
I love that club.

09:25.064 --> 09:27.275
Well, I just, I don't think
it's good for you.

09:29.277 --> 09:32.863
Donna, look, you've been
a tremendous help...

09:34.448 --> 09:36.033
...but now
you're interfering.

09:38.786 --> 09:40.496
You're right;
I, I'm, I'm sorry.

09:40.579 --> 09:42.540
No, no, it's no big deal,
I just...

09:42.623 --> 09:44.709
I want you to know, okay?

09:44.792 --> 09:46.210
I haven't made any
final decisions yet.

09:46.294 --> 09:48.337
{\an3}Okay?
Okay.

09:50.756 --> 09:53.467
So... you, uh,
want some breakfast?

09:53.551 --> 09:55.886
What, you're going to actually
tell me you have food

09:55.970 --> 09:58.180
in that fridge?

09:58.264 --> 10:00.975
And not only do I have
waffles and eggs, but...

10:01.058 --> 10:02.518
{\an1}I happened to pick up
some fresh mango,

10:02.601 --> 10:06.314
which I know a certain little
interfering angel likes.

10:10.943 --> 10:12.820
{\an3}Morning. You got a copy
of today's rundown?

10:12.903 --> 10:14.030
I'm working on it, Brandon.

10:14.113 --> 10:15.364
But we usually don't
meet till 12:00.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.742
Yeah, I know, but we've
got a lot to do, okay?

10:17.825 --> 10:19.368
{\an3}And we'll just
act as if

10:19.452 --> 10:21.329
{\an3}nothing's happening,
shall we?

10:21.412 --> 10:23.039
Nothing is happening.

10:23.122 --> 10:24.790
{\an3}Why? Have you
defied the odds

10:24.874 --> 10:26.208
in the campus pools
and plea bargained?

10:26.292 --> 10:28.419
Chase another story,
would you, Gaylian?

10:28.502 --> 10:31.047
Come on, what
is the deal?

10:31.130 --> 10:32.673
{\an1}The committee put
a gag order on you?

10:32.757 --> 10:34.633
{\an3}The guy's got no case,
all right? It's going to be

10:34.717 --> 10:35.926
over in ten minutes.
Can we talk

10:36.010 --> 10:37.553
about something else now?

10:37.636 --> 10:39.221
And I thought denial
was a river in Egypt.

10:39.305 --> 10:40.097
That's not funny.

10:40.181 --> 10:42.308
Why won't Randall
drop the charges?

10:42.391 --> 10:43.726
Steve's confession
should clear you.

10:43.809 --> 10:45.770
Steve's word is
a little tainted these days,

10:45.853 --> 10:47.688
and Randall's looking
to settle an old score.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.482
I thought he just got here.

10:51.317 --> 10:53.110
Randall was a teacher here
about three years ago.

10:53.194 --> 10:55.738
Steve and I took a class of his
together-- this is old news.

10:55.821 --> 10:58.532
You know, Brandon,
it's hard for your friends

10:58.616 --> 11:00.910
to support you when you try
to do it all yourself.

11:00.993 --> 11:05.081
Trace, you didn't tell me
you were a psych major.

11:05.164 --> 11:06.749
Okay.

11:06.832 --> 11:09.085
Well, if you need anything,
I'm here.

11:09.168 --> 11:11.003
Thanks.

11:15.674 --> 11:18.052
{\an3}No, no, no cream.
Black's good.

11:22.473 --> 11:24.266
{\an3}Hey, why waste
the time studying?

11:24.350 --> 11:25.726
{\an3}You're just
gonna be expelled.

11:25.810 --> 11:27.520
A lot of belief in the, uh,

11:27.603 --> 11:29.271
{\an1}presumption of innocence,
huh, Cory?

11:29.355 --> 11:30.564
{\an3}What is this,
law books?

11:30.648 --> 11:32.108
Don't you know
the old adage?

11:32.191 --> 11:35.069
{\an1}Any lawyer who defends himself
has got a fool for a client?

11:35.152 --> 11:36.445
Well, I guess

11:36.529 --> 11:38.948
I'm okay then,
'cause I'm not a lawyer, am I?

11:39.031 --> 11:40.449
No, but see, that's my point.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.284
I was hoping
for a worthy adversary.

11:42.368 --> 11:44.286
There's no... no sport
in a one-sided contest.

11:44.370 --> 11:46.956
{\an3}And what about the
fact that I'm innocent?

11:47.039 --> 11:49.291
What does that do for you?
See, that's the challenge.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.127
{\an3}Why don't we cut
to the chase, Cory?

11:51.210 --> 11:52.628
{\an3}We both know what
this is about.

11:52.711 --> 11:54.130
Brandon, I'm a teacher.

11:54.213 --> 11:56.757
{\an1}And I'm about to teach you
a really painful lesson.

11:56.841 --> 11:59.635
Think of it as, uh--
I don't know-- a public service.

11:59.718 --> 12:02.304
I didn't sleep with your wife
while you guys were together.

12:02.388 --> 12:03.806
{\an1}You know that.
That's just great.

12:03.889 --> 12:05.641
That's a point
you are gonna want to stress

12:05.724 --> 12:08.144
at the hearing tomorrow.

12:08.227 --> 12:10.980
{\an1}It'll do wonders
for your reputation.

12:11.063 --> 12:13.065
{\an1}Good luck.

12:19.113 --> 12:21.031
{\an3}DR. MARTIN:
Hi, kids.

12:21.115 --> 12:23.659
{\an3}Hi, Daddy.
Welcome. Good.

12:23.742 --> 12:24.994
{\an6}Hi, David.
Good to see you.
Hi.
Hi, sweetie.

12:25.077 --> 12:26.370
{\an3}Sit down.

12:26.454 --> 12:27.496
{\an1}David!
Hi.

12:27.580 --> 12:28.831
Boy, you're looking
very well.

12:28.914 --> 12:29.915
How are you feeling?

12:29.999 --> 12:31.709
Fine, thanks.

12:31.792 --> 12:33.711
{\an3}FELICE:
Terrific.

12:33.794 --> 12:36.172
You know, John has been telling
me all about your Dr. Tate.

12:36.255 --> 12:37.673
{\an1}I understand
he's the best in his field.

12:37.756 --> 12:40.176
{\an1}Yeah, yeah,
I got pretty lucky.

12:40.259 --> 12:41.177
Have you heard him play yet?

12:41.260 --> 12:42.678
What do you mean?

12:42.761 --> 12:43.846
He's a closet jazzman.

12:43.929 --> 12:46.682
Every Monday night, he goes
out to the Valley at a club,

12:46.765 --> 12:48.142
and he plays the sax.

12:48.225 --> 12:50.186
Oh, like Woody Allen
with his clarinet.

12:50.269 --> 12:51.479
Oh. Isn't that interesting?

12:51.562 --> 12:53.189
Has he met your mother, David?

12:55.983 --> 12:57.902
I understand
that he's also very talented.

13:00.738 --> 13:03.574
Yeah, he has met my mother.

13:04.950 --> 13:07.661
{\an1}Uh, would...
would you all excuse me

13:07.745 --> 13:09.663
for a second, please?

13:09.747 --> 13:11.081
Oh, of course. Sure.
Yeah, sure.

13:13.626 --> 13:16.837
Well, David seems to be
bearing up pretty well,

13:16.921 --> 13:18.506
{\an3}considering,
and it's so nice

13:18.589 --> 13:21.509
of you to be such a good friend
to him, honey.

13:21.592 --> 13:23.219
I mean, after this summer...

13:23.302 --> 13:25.346
{\an6}DR. MARTIN:
Maybe we could drive
out to the Valley

13:25.429 --> 13:27.014
and hear Julius play one night.

13:27.097 --> 13:30.059
Mom... what if, uh...

13:30.142 --> 13:33.062
what if David was more
than just a friend?

13:33.145 --> 13:35.481
What's that supposed to mean?

13:36.482 --> 13:37.566
You're not seeing him again...

13:37.650 --> 13:39.109
What if I am?

13:39.193 --> 13:41.070
Would there be a problem
with that?

13:41.153 --> 13:43.697
Donna, the two of you have been
so on-again, off-again...

13:43.781 --> 13:45.908
I just don't want
to see you hurt.

13:45.991 --> 13:49.203
What, so now that David has
a problem, he's damaged goods?

13:51.664 --> 13:52.623
That's not what I mean.

13:52.706 --> 13:54.291
{\an3}DR. MARTIN:
Felice, Donna,

13:54.375 --> 13:55.417
now, let's...

13:55.501 --> 13:56.669
Let's just take one step

13:56.752 --> 13:57.795
back here, all right?

13:57.878 --> 13:59.421
Daddy, she...

13:59.505 --> 14:02.424
she has been acting this way
since we walked in here.

14:02.508 --> 14:03.551
What, he's not

14:03.634 --> 14:05.719
fit to be in our exalted family?

14:05.803 --> 14:06.887
Donna, please.

14:06.971 --> 14:09.265
I'm a doctor's wife.

14:09.348 --> 14:10.766
I think
I have some understanding

14:10.849 --> 14:12.101
of the nature
of this sort of thing.

14:12.184 --> 14:13.227
That's not what
I'm saying at all.

14:13.310 --> 14:14.186
No. You know what?

14:14.270 --> 14:15.938
That is <i> exactly</i>
what you're saying.

14:16.021 --> 14:18.315
And I'm not sticking around
to hear about it.

14:18.399 --> 14:20.442
{\an3}Donna, Donna, no, wait--
please don't go.

14:20.526 --> 14:22.778
{\an1}No, Daddy,
I'm... I am sorry.

14:22.861 --> 14:24.446
I am really sorry
that I'm ruining dinner.

14:25.489 --> 14:27.908
But, uh,
we have another engagement,

14:27.992 --> 14:31.704
{\an1}so would you please tell David
that I'll be in the car?

14:31.787 --> 14:33.789
Good night, Daddy.

14:33.872 --> 14:35.249
Mother.

14:48.387 --> 14:51.432
(gavel banging)

14:51.515 --> 14:52.766
Good morning.

14:52.850 --> 14:54.602
This session
of the Disciplinary Tribunal

14:54.685 --> 14:55.644
in the matter

14:55.728 --> 14:59.690
of <i> California University</i>
<i>v. Brandon Walsh</i>

14:59.773 --> 15:01.984
is hereby called to order.

15:02.067 --> 15:04.111
Who is representing the defense?

15:04.194 --> 15:05.112
{\an1}I do, sir.

15:05.195 --> 15:06.155
{\an1}ARNOLD:
And Professor Randall

15:06.238 --> 15:07.698
is acting for the university.

15:07.781 --> 15:09.033
Are you ready,
Professor Randall?

15:09.116 --> 15:11.076
Yes, sir, I am.

15:11.160 --> 15:12.411
Since both parties have agreed

15:12.494 --> 15:13.871
to waive
their opening statements,

15:13.954 --> 15:15.664
Professor Randall,
you may begin.

15:15.748 --> 15:16.874
Thank you.

15:16.957 --> 15:18.542
The University calls
Steve Sanders.

15:18.626 --> 15:20.169
Uh, you know what?

15:20.252 --> 15:22.046
I'm not really feeling too good.

15:22.129 --> 15:23.255
I was kind of hoping

15:23.339 --> 15:25.049
I could be excused.

15:25.132 --> 15:26.842
You're here.
That's good enough for me.

15:26.925 --> 15:28.135
Please take the stand.

15:30.554 --> 15:33.182
(Steve coughing)

15:33.265 --> 15:35.267
Good morning,
Mr. Sanders.

15:35.351 --> 15:37.686
For some of us.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.021
Did you plagiarize a paper

15:39.104 --> 15:41.106
written by Mr. Walsh
from my sociology class,

15:41.190 --> 15:43.359
and submit it as your own
for Independent Studies?

15:43.442 --> 15:46.028
Yes. Yes, I did.

15:46.111 --> 15:47.696
And did you turn this paper in
yourself?

15:47.780 --> 15:49.198
{\an1}STEVE: No, a friend
did that for me.

15:49.281 --> 15:50.866
Morton Muntz.

15:50.949 --> 15:52.868
Okay, so how did he get it?

15:52.951 --> 15:54.870
Brandon.

15:54.953 --> 15:56.664
Brandon Walsh?

15:56.747 --> 15:57.915
Objection, Your Honor.

15:57.998 --> 16:00.376
Well, are you denying that you
handed this paper to Mr. Muntz?

16:00.459 --> 16:01.669
No, but I had
no knowledge--

16:01.752 --> 16:03.003
So what are you objecting to?

16:03.087 --> 16:04.713
{\an1}The fact that I found out
about it?

16:04.797 --> 16:06.256
Look, Brandon had nothing
to do with this.

16:06.340 --> 16:07.508
It was in a sealed envelope.

16:07.591 --> 16:08.550
He didn't even know about it.

16:08.634 --> 16:09.510
{\an6}RANDALL:
Wait, now, let me
get this straight.

16:09.593 --> 16:12.388
{\an1}You handled over a paper
which you had written,

16:12.471 --> 16:14.515
{\an1}and yet, somehow
you knew nothing about it?

16:14.598 --> 16:16.600
Objection withdrawn.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.272
How long have you known
Mr. Walsh?

16:24.483 --> 16:25.567
Seven years.

16:25.651 --> 16:27.361
{\an3}And you live in his
house, don't you?

16:27.444 --> 16:28.987
Yes.

16:29.071 --> 16:30.531
You'd help him out of a jam,
wouldn't you?

16:30.614 --> 16:32.116
Give him my left arm.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.244
You've been in trouble before,
haven't you?

16:35.327 --> 16:37.371
Once or twice.

16:37.454 --> 16:39.081
{\an3}RANDALL:
And has Mr. Walsh

16:39.164 --> 16:40.582
{\an1}helped you out
in the past?

16:40.666 --> 16:42.251
{\an6}Yes.
RANDALL:
Mm-hmm.

16:42.334 --> 16:44.878
Would you say many times?

16:44.962 --> 16:46.839
{\an6}Yes.
RANDALL:
So you got in trouble

16:46.922 --> 16:49.091
in Independent Studies,
and he helped you out,

16:49.174 --> 16:51.135
{\an1}just like he's done
for seven years, right?

16:51.218 --> 16:52.344
No. No.

16:52.428 --> 16:54.054
He didn't know I took the paper.

16:54.138 --> 16:55.305
Oh, come on, Mr. Sanders.

16:55.389 --> 16:57.808
He's your best friend
in the world, isn't he?

17:02.020 --> 17:02.938
Mr. Sanders?

17:03.021 --> 17:04.732
He was.

17:06.191 --> 17:09.403
He was my best friend
until I stole the paper.

17:11.029 --> 17:13.741
Now he won't even talk to me.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.411
So, I don't blame him.

17:18.537 --> 17:20.164
{\an1}I lost my best friend
over this.

17:20.247 --> 17:23.250
How much more proof do you need
that Brandon didn't do anything?

17:24.752 --> 17:25.961
{\an1}RANDALL:
That's all.

17:26.044 --> 17:27.421
{\an3}Thank you.

17:35.554 --> 17:37.598
{\an5}DONNA:
<i>Thanks for finding time</i>
<i>to see me.</i>

17:37.681 --> 17:39.808
Y-You don't mind if I eat my
lunch while we talk, do you?

17:39.892 --> 17:42.728
Oh, of course not.

17:42.811 --> 17:44.521
{\an1}Daddy, I'm really sorry
about last night.

17:44.605 --> 17:46.440
Oh.
I was just upset.

17:46.523 --> 17:48.525
Mom obviously touched a
nerve there, didn't she?

17:48.609 --> 17:49.693
(quiet laugh)

17:49.777 --> 17:51.069
So you and David--

17:51.153 --> 17:54.114
uh, you're back together again?

17:54.198 --> 17:57.367
Daddy... would it be a mistake

17:57.451 --> 17:59.870
if David and I got involved
again?

17:59.953 --> 18:04.208
You want to talk to the doctor,
or you want to talk to the dad?

18:04.291 --> 18:06.710
I think I need
the medical advice right now.

18:06.794 --> 18:07.711
Was Mom right?

18:07.795 --> 18:08.712
Well, David seems

18:08.796 --> 18:10.005
to be doing just fine.

18:10.088 --> 18:11.632
He's got his problem
under control.

18:11.715 --> 18:13.842
He's under the care
of a good physician.

18:13.926 --> 18:18.806
I don't see any medical
impediment to a relationship.

18:18.889 --> 18:19.807
Really?

18:19.890 --> 18:20.849
{\an3}Friendship

18:20.933 --> 18:22.684
is the best medicine.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.311
And I think that, in part,

18:24.394 --> 18:27.606
you are responsible
for his doing so well.

18:29.191 --> 18:30.901
And in the future?

18:30.984 --> 18:32.986
I mean, it's... it's probably
never gonna happen.

18:33.070 --> 18:38.408
But what if we did get married,
and we wanted to have children?

18:38.492 --> 18:40.410
Sweetheart...

18:40.494 --> 18:42.412
these kinds
of chemical imbalances

18:42.496 --> 18:44.248
can be inherited.

18:44.331 --> 18:45.833
But so can high
blood pressure

18:45.916 --> 18:47.084
and cancer and
heart disease.

18:47.167 --> 18:50.087
This is no reason
not to love someone.

18:50.170 --> 18:52.089
What about Mom's objections?

18:52.172 --> 18:53.674
You're old enough

18:53.757 --> 18:55.843
to stop worrying about her

18:55.926 --> 18:58.053
and live your own life.

18:58.136 --> 19:00.097
(quiet laugh)

19:03.308 --> 19:05.227
(knocking)

19:05.310 --> 19:07.312
(computer beeps)

19:10.315 --> 19:12.734
Hi.

19:12.818 --> 19:14.611
Hey. What are you doing here?

19:14.695 --> 19:15.904
{\an3}Well, since you
haven't come to me,

19:15.988 --> 19:17.239
{\an3}I thought I was
gonna come to you.

19:17.322 --> 19:18.240
(both laugh nervously)

19:18.323 --> 19:19.241
Can I come in?

19:19.324 --> 19:20.409
{\an1}Yeah, yeah, sure.
Thanks.

19:20.492 --> 19:21.493
Sorry. Come on in.

19:25.664 --> 19:28.250
So, what's up?

19:28.333 --> 19:31.253
{\an3}Well, I haven't
seen you since Vegas.

19:31.336 --> 19:33.589
Is anything wrong?

19:33.672 --> 19:35.132
Uh, no, no. I've just...

19:35.215 --> 19:36.550
I've been really busy,

19:36.633 --> 19:39.219
{\an1}you know, with my workouts,
outpatient therapy,

19:39.303 --> 19:42.264
{\an1}trying to catch up on all
the stuff I missed in school.

19:42.347 --> 19:45.267
Well, I'm glad to hear
you're not avoiding me.

19:45.350 --> 19:49.605
Because we're still
partners, aren't we?

19:49.688 --> 19:54.568
{\an1}Look, I've just been
trying to sort things out.

19:54.651 --> 19:56.528
{\an3}You mean Donna's
trying to sort you?

19:58.488 --> 20:01.116
Listen, David...

20:01.199 --> 20:03.619
{\an3}do you really need
her permission?

20:03.702 --> 20:05.454
{\an3}Because I know
you want the club.

20:05.537 --> 20:07.289
Look, Val, Donna's been great.

20:07.372 --> 20:08.790
Look, I don't get it.

20:08.874 --> 20:10.125
I know you, David.

20:10.208 --> 20:12.252
You and I are alike.

20:12.336 --> 20:14.129
And we need that heat.

20:14.212 --> 20:16.089
We-We want that challenge.

20:17.549 --> 20:20.093
And we're alike
in another way.

20:20.177 --> 20:21.219
(laughs)

20:21.303 --> 20:22.304
Really?

20:22.387 --> 20:23.597
What's that?

20:23.680 --> 20:25.933
{\an3}We're not afraid to
go after what we want.

20:27.935 --> 20:30.270
{\an3}At least you
never used to be.

20:32.397 --> 20:35.025
Things have changed
a lot since then.

20:38.278 --> 20:40.322
Look, Val,
when I made that offer,

20:40.405 --> 20:44.326
I was... I was
in another state of mind.

20:47.037 --> 20:48.956
Listen, David,

20:49.039 --> 20:51.250
I am really happy that
you're getting healthy,

20:51.333 --> 20:55.462
{\an3}because that's the kind
of partner I need.

20:57.255 --> 21:00.509
{\an3}But if you are not going
to keep your promise to me,

21:00.592 --> 21:03.303
I need to know
about it now.

21:12.521 --> 21:13.397
Hey!
Hey.

21:13.480 --> 21:15.482
{\an1}Want to make your forbidden
passion come true?

21:15.565 --> 21:17.025
{\an3}Ooh, I like
to hear that.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.360
What's this?

21:18.443 --> 21:20.988
A pre-birthday present.

21:21.071 --> 21:22.823
A tape? What's on it?

21:22.906 --> 21:23.991
It's blank.

21:24.074 --> 21:25.200
How's this sound?

21:25.283 --> 21:26.493
Dinner at Matsuhisa,

21:26.576 --> 21:28.578
{\an1}then we will catch a show
at Billboard,

21:28.662 --> 21:30.414
{\an1}then we'll go back
to your place,

21:30.497 --> 21:34.042
{\an3}where, through the miracle
of videotape technology,

21:34.126 --> 21:36.003
we can watch your
little Judo Queen

21:36.086 --> 21:37.462
{\an3}until your heart
is content.

21:38.463 --> 21:39.548
I like the sound of that.

21:39.631 --> 21:41.550
I thought you might.
What do you say?

21:41.633 --> 21:42.718
You feel like being spoiled?

21:42.801 --> 21:46.388
Well... okay.

21:46.471 --> 21:47.389
But just this once.

21:47.472 --> 21:49.516
{\an3}(laughs)

21:50.517 --> 21:51.601
{\an1}ARNOLD:
Recess is over.

21:51.685 --> 21:52.769
{\an1}You may proceed,
Professor.

21:52.853 --> 21:55.397
Call Brandon Walsh, please.

21:55.480 --> 21:58.692
{\an4}ARNOLD:
Mr. Walsh, this hearing
is more informal than

21:58.775 --> 22:01.069
a jury trial,
but you do have the right

22:01.153 --> 22:03.739
to decline Professor Randall's
request to take the stand.

22:03.822 --> 22:05.699
Actually, sir,

22:05.782 --> 22:08.035
I'm looking forward to getting
involved in this trial.

22:08.118 --> 22:09.578
Maybe then
the truth can come out.

22:09.661 --> 22:11.371
{\an1}That's all
anyone can ask.

22:13.707 --> 22:15.042
{\an1}Mr. Walsh,
Mr. Sanders has testified

22:15.125 --> 22:16.626
that the two of you
were best friends;

22:16.710 --> 22:18.420
roommates for years;

22:18.503 --> 22:20.756
that you got him out of
trouble time and time again.

22:20.839 --> 22:22.382
And yet, somehow, inexplicably,

22:22.466 --> 22:23.800
you know nothing about
his confessed plagiarism

22:23.884 --> 22:24.926
with your paper.

22:25.010 --> 22:26.928
{\an1}That's right.
Can we, uh,

22:27.012 --> 22:28.805
cut to the chase, Mr. Walsh?

22:28.889 --> 22:29.765
This isn't the first time

22:29.848 --> 22:31.767
you and Mr. Sanders
have cheated, is it?

22:31.850 --> 22:34.686
I'm sorry, and when did
you stop beating your wife?

22:35.979 --> 22:37.689
What, is that supposed
to be some kind of objection?

22:37.773 --> 22:39.441
I don't know,
why don't you ask your wife?

22:39.524 --> 22:41.193
Ooh, I'm sorry, ex-wife.

22:43.361 --> 22:44.362
{\an3}RANDALL:
That's good.

22:44.446 --> 22:47.574
You and Mr. Sanders
took my Sociology 131 class

22:47.657 --> 22:48.617
three years ago, didn't you?

22:48.700 --> 22:49.618
Nothing wrong with that,

22:49.701 --> 22:50.619
other than it was boring.

22:50.702 --> 22:52.454
Guilty as charged.

22:54.081 --> 22:55.624
Did you start at the
beginning of the semester?

22:55.707 --> 22:57.793
No, I transferred in a couple
of weeks late at the deadline.

22:57.876 --> 22:59.461
Do you recall if we had

22:59.544 --> 23:01.463
weekly quizzes in that class?

23:01.546 --> 23:02.798
Yes, every Friday.

23:02.881 --> 23:05.342
And do you recall
the quiz of October 11th?

23:05.425 --> 23:06.510
Integrated Societal Systems?

23:06.593 --> 23:08.136
Not particularly.

23:08.220 --> 23:10.097
Oh, really, I'm surprised,
because you did very well

23:10.180 --> 23:11.848
for your first quiz:
84 percent.

23:11.932 --> 23:13.600
{\an1}You don't happen to have
a copy of the test, do you?

23:13.683 --> 23:15.310
Now, why would I have
a copy of that test?

23:15.394 --> 23:17.020
Because so many
people failed it,

23:17.104 --> 23:19.314
that it became known as
the "Columbus Day Massacre."

23:19.397 --> 23:20.690
But, of course,
you didn't fail it.

23:20.774 --> 23:22.609
Neither did Mr. Sanders.

23:22.692 --> 23:24.569
{\an1}You don't happen to
remember what grade he got?

23:24.653 --> 23:25.862
Nope.

23:25.946 --> 23:27.948
{\an3}Well, then why don't
you read it to us?

23:28.031 --> 23:30.200
{\an1}It's right there, third line
down, fourth column over.

23:30.283 --> 23:31.701
Eighty-four.

23:31.785 --> 23:32.702
So what?
It's a coincidence.

23:32.786 --> 23:33.829
Perhaps, but then,

23:33.912 --> 23:35.455
{\an1}would you also read
the grades he got

23:35.539 --> 23:37.624
on the three weeks
prior to your arrival?

23:39.626 --> 23:42.170
41, 34, 26.

23:42.254 --> 23:44.005
{\an3}RANDALL: And yet, somehow,
after you arrived,

23:44.089 --> 23:45.006
Mr. Sanders' problems

23:45.090 --> 23:46.007
suddenly disappeared.

23:46.091 --> 23:47.050
Read on.

23:47.134 --> 23:48.718
This doesn't prove anything.

23:48.802 --> 23:50.011
I didn't let him

23:50.095 --> 23:51.138
cheat off me then and I'm not

23:51.221 --> 23:52.305
letting him cheat off me now.

23:52.389 --> 23:54.015
Numbers don't lie.
But you do.

23:54.099 --> 23:55.350
Mr. Walsh, that's out of order.

23:55.433 --> 23:56.852
Chancellor, this is ludicrous.

23:56.935 --> 23:58.520
Even if this were true,

23:58.603 --> 24:01.314
it doesn't prove that I gave
Steve the paper in question.

24:01.398 --> 24:02.482
Yes, but circumstantial evidence

24:02.566 --> 24:04.067
is like pearls on a string.

24:04.151 --> 24:06.528
Sooner or later, you have
enough to make a necklace.

24:06.611 --> 24:08.488
But none of this
ever happened, sir.

24:08.572 --> 24:09.656
If it did,

24:09.739 --> 24:11.533
{\an1}why didn't he
bring it up then?

24:11.616 --> 24:12.701
Because I didn't realize

24:12.784 --> 24:14.369
you were such close
friends at the time.

24:14.452 --> 24:16.288
{\an3}I made a mistake not reporting
the incident then,

24:16.371 --> 24:18.748
{\an3}and I feel compelled not to
let this university make

24:18.832 --> 24:19.791
the same mistake twice.

24:19.875 --> 24:21.084
{\an1}Oh, so that's why
you doctored

24:21.168 --> 24:22.252
{\an1}the course ledger--
very good.

24:22.335 --> 24:25.005
Now, that's a very
serious accusation.

24:25.088 --> 24:26.047
There are rules
about slander,

24:26.131 --> 24:26.882
even in informal hearings.

24:26.965 --> 24:28.967
{\an1}Well, what about perjury?
Or forgery?

24:29.050 --> 24:29.926
I'm not on trial here.

24:30.010 --> 24:31.011
Well, maybe you should be.

24:31.094 --> 24:32.679
Mr. Walsh,
you are out of order!

24:32.762 --> 24:35.557
Chancellor, justice
is supposed to be blind,

24:35.640 --> 24:36.850
not deaf and dumb.

25:00.165 --> 25:02.042
{\an4}Hey!
Hurry, they'll
be here any minute.

25:02.125 --> 25:03.084
{\an3}Oh, this is
so junior high.

25:03.168 --> 25:04.169
Yeah, isn't it great?

25:04.252 --> 25:05.921
{\an3}Yeah, except for you have
to park two miles away.

25:06.004 --> 25:07.756
{\an3}I mean, whatever happened
to the courtesy bus?

25:09.466 --> 25:11.218
{\an1}Have you heard
anything about Brandon?

25:11.301 --> 25:13.553
No, but he and Steve

25:13.637 --> 25:15.513
are really on the outs.

25:15.597 --> 25:16.765
Let's hope
everything works out.

25:16.848 --> 25:19.100
(laughs)
Come on, this is Brandon.

25:19.184 --> 25:20.769
When don't things
work out for him?

25:20.852 --> 25:21.895
{\an3}(laughs)

25:23.146 --> 25:26.149
{\an3}Did, uh, did you
talk to Valerie yet?

25:26.233 --> 25:28.401
Yeah, yeah, she stopped
by this afternoon.

25:28.485 --> 25:29.945
Yeah, what happened?

25:30.028 --> 25:31.738
We had a good talk.

25:31.821 --> 25:33.323
She was pretty understanding.

25:34.366 --> 25:36.117
{\an3}TRACY: I see his car!
Here they come!

25:36.201 --> 25:37.911
{\an3}Shh, everybody,
they're here!

25:37.994 --> 25:38.954
Hit the lights.
Hit the lights.

25:39.037 --> 25:40.330
Cut the music!

25:43.166 --> 25:44.125
I am so embarrassed.

25:44.209 --> 25:47.170
{\an1}I invite you to dinner
and you have to pay for it.

25:47.254 --> 25:49.965
It's not a problem, really.

25:50.048 --> 25:51.967
{\an1}Do you know where
you left your purse?

25:52.050 --> 25:54.970
{\an3}Uh, yeah, I think I must have
set it on top of the VCR

25:55.053 --> 25:56.805
{\an3}when we were
setting the timer.

25:56.888 --> 25:58.974
Of course the concert
tickets are in there.

25:59.057 --> 26:00.350
{\an1}You know,
to tell you the truth,

26:00.433 --> 26:02.143
I'm glad we're here.
Yeah?

26:02.227 --> 26:04.562
{\an1}Maybe we should just stay in,
because that dress is doing

26:04.646 --> 26:06.773
{\an1}amazing things
to my heart rate.

26:06.856 --> 26:07.774
{\an3}(chuckling)

26:07.857 --> 26:11.611
ALL:
Surprise!

26:17.284 --> 26:20.620
Yeah, it certainly is.

26:23.123 --> 26:24.833
Hey, Nat,
hit me again, will ya?

26:24.916 --> 26:26.835
So what's the latest?

26:26.918 --> 26:29.504
Well, it turns out that, uh,

26:29.587 --> 26:31.506
me giving the paper to Muntz
was pretty damning.

26:31.589 --> 26:32.841
And then Randall told them that

26:32.924 --> 26:34.676
Steve's been cheating
off me for years.

26:34.759 --> 26:36.511
I'm afraid to ask.
Is it true?

26:36.594 --> 26:37.846
Well, if it is true,

26:37.929 --> 26:40.515
I get expelled and I can
never trust anybody again.

26:40.598 --> 26:42.976
And if it isn't true,
I just get expelled.

26:43.059 --> 26:44.519
It's a win-win situation.

26:44.602 --> 26:47.147
Well, just keep fighting
the good fight.

26:47.230 --> 26:48.523
That's all you can do.

26:48.606 --> 26:50.525
That's exactly
what my father said.

26:50.608 --> 26:52.736
I called him tonight
to give him the good news.

26:52.819 --> 26:54.946
How come you're not
at Kelly's surprise party?

26:55.030 --> 26:58.408
Well, I'm not in the most
social of moods right now, Nat,

26:58.491 --> 27:00.035
I'm sure you understand.

27:00.118 --> 27:02.871
Yeah, but Brando, this is the
time you need your friends most.

27:02.954 --> 27:06.207
My advice is
get your butt up there.

27:06.291 --> 27:08.418
Maybe I will.

27:08.501 --> 27:10.045
You got any other
words of advice?

27:10.128 --> 27:11.421
Yeah.

27:11.504 --> 27:13.923
Don't feel sorry for yourself
until you have to.

27:14.007 --> 27:16.343
My father said that, too.

27:16.426 --> 27:17.594
Hmm.

27:17.677 --> 27:18.970
Hmm.

27:19.054 --> 27:21.681
{\an3}Wise man.

27:23.141 --> 27:24.392
{\an3}(chuckling)

27:24.476 --> 27:27.729
{\an1}Donna, thanks for getting
everything ready.

27:27.812 --> 27:28.855
The place looks great.

27:28.938 --> 27:29.898
Oh, my pleasure.

27:29.981 --> 27:31.066
You think Mark
was surprised?

27:31.149 --> 27:32.400
Yeah, yeah.

27:32.484 --> 27:34.402
Where are Steve and Clare?

27:34.486 --> 27:35.403
Uh, not here yet.

27:35.487 --> 27:36.363
Neither is Brandon.

27:36.446 --> 27:38.406
What are we going
to do with those two?

27:38.490 --> 27:39.616
What do you say we lock them

27:39.699 --> 27:40.909
in a closet till they come

27:40.992 --> 27:42.660
to their senses?

27:43.661 --> 27:45.413
{\an1}DONNA:
Yeah, well,

27:45.497 --> 27:47.916
I'd like to lock
Valerie away in a closet.

27:47.999 --> 27:50.085
Mm... that sounds like
something I would say.

27:50.168 --> 27:51.252
(giggles)

27:51.336 --> 27:53.380
{\an3}She's just making it
so hard on David.

27:53.463 --> 27:55.423
{\an3}In fact, would you
excuse me for a second?

27:55.507 --> 27:56.591
Certainly.

27:56.674 --> 27:59.469
Oh, here comes
the fun police.

27:59.552 --> 28:00.637
Hey, Val.

28:00.720 --> 28:01.846
Hey, Donna, uh,

28:01.930 --> 28:03.264
I'm gonna go get
something to drink.

28:03.348 --> 28:04.265
You guys want something?

28:04.349 --> 28:05.350
No, thanks.

28:05.433 --> 28:07.102
No, thanks, I'm fine.

28:07.185 --> 28:08.269
Sobriety.

28:08.353 --> 28:10.021
I like that in a partner.

28:14.859 --> 28:16.319
Partner?

28:16.403 --> 28:17.654
I thought you said
she understood

28:17.737 --> 28:18.780
you weren't buying in.

28:18.863 --> 28:22.409
{\an3}No, I said I haven't
decided yet.

28:22.492 --> 28:25.203
Oh.

28:25.286 --> 28:27.997
Then I guess it was me
that didn't understand.

28:28.081 --> 28:29.124
KELLY:
Hey, everybody!

28:29.207 --> 28:30.667
Why don't we open
presents now?

28:33.002 --> 28:34.796
{\an1}Kelly, I don't want
to open presents right now.

28:34.879 --> 28:36.464
Sure you do;
you have to.

28:36.548 --> 28:37.924
Don't be shy.

28:38.007 --> 28:40.802
(sighing)
Wow, it's a great haul.

28:40.885 --> 28:41.928
I don't know which
one to open first.

28:42.011 --> 28:43.680
{\an1}Mine's the one
with the red bow.

28:43.763 --> 28:45.640
Thanks for the tip.

28:45.723 --> 28:47.308
{\an4}YOUNG MAN:
Hey, Brandon!
How's it going?

28:47.392 --> 28:48.143
Oh, there's Brandon.

28:48.226 --> 28:49.227
{\an3}WOMAN:
How you doing?

28:49.310 --> 28:50.812
{\an3}WOMAN 2:
Hey!

28:50.895 --> 28:51.896
Go ahead, this can wait.

28:51.980 --> 28:53.440
Are you sure?

28:53.523 --> 28:54.858
Yeah.

28:59.404 --> 29:02.657
Kelly, she's like
a moth to a flame.

29:02.740 --> 29:04.242
Well, they're old friends.

29:04.325 --> 29:05.535
She's worried about him.

29:05.618 --> 29:09.247
{\an1}Well, shouldn't she be
worried about you right now?

29:11.166 --> 29:12.500
Hey, Brandon, how'd it go?

29:12.584 --> 29:13.710
Uh, don't ask.

29:13.793 --> 29:16.337
{\an3}Oh, come on, don't
keep us in suspense.

29:16.421 --> 29:18.173
Is Steve here?

29:18.256 --> 29:19.841
No, not yet, but Clare
said they were coming.

29:19.924 --> 29:21.176
There may be a change in plans

29:21.259 --> 29:22.135
after what happened today.

29:22.218 --> 29:24.971
{\an3}Clare said that Steve's
testimony went well.

29:25.054 --> 29:28.391
If by burying me it went well,
then, yeah, it went very well.

29:29.392 --> 29:30.852
Why, what happened?

29:30.935 --> 29:32.979
All right, first,

29:33.062 --> 29:34.522
{\an3}Professor Randall
comes in like

29:34.606 --> 29:35.648
{\an1}he's in <i> Witness</i>
<i>For the Prosecution.</i>

29:35.732 --> 29:37.150
{\an1}I mean, the guy
should have been wearing

29:37.233 --> 29:38.193
a powdered wig and a robe.

29:38.276 --> 29:40.528
{\an1}Next thing I know, he's
sucking up to the chancellor

29:40.612 --> 29:42.155
like he's Eddie Haskell.

29:42.238 --> 29:46.034
{\an1}So then, he reminds the
tribunal that I was the one

29:46.117 --> 29:47.494
that handed the
paper to Muntz.

29:47.577 --> 29:50.413
{\an1}So now, not only did
Steve steal my term paper,

29:50.497 --> 29:52.332
{\an1}but I'm also
part of the chain

29:52.415 --> 29:53.666
{\an1}that handed it in
for him.

29:53.750 --> 29:56.085
Oh, I can't deal
with this.

29:56.169 --> 29:57.378
I'm outta here.

29:57.462 --> 29:59.923
{\an3}Well, I'm gonna
go in, okay?

30:00.006 --> 30:00.715
He buried me.

30:00.798 --> 30:02.217
{\an1}He couldn't have
buried me any better

30:02.300 --> 30:03.510
if he would've
had a backhoe

30:03.593 --> 30:04.511
and a ton of dirt.

30:04.594 --> 30:06.054
Can you get a ride?

30:06.137 --> 30:07.931
Yeah.

30:08.014 --> 30:09.682
{\an3}What do you want me
to tell them?

30:11.100 --> 30:12.977
Just tell them I'm sick.

30:14.812 --> 30:16.064
Thanks.

30:16.147 --> 30:17.815
Bye.

30:26.324 --> 30:27.534
There you are.

30:27.617 --> 30:28.868
What are you doing?

30:28.952 --> 30:29.744
{\an1}Everyone's
looking for you.

30:29.827 --> 30:31.871
Why? They have Brandon;
they'll be fine.

30:31.955 --> 30:34.040
That doesn't sound like you.

30:34.123 --> 30:35.416
Well, maybe you just
haven't seen enough

30:35.500 --> 30:36.417
of my petty jealous side.

30:36.501 --> 30:38.836
Come on, Mark.

30:40.046 --> 30:42.382
{\an3}I'll let you in on
a little secret, okay?

30:42.465 --> 30:43.967
I hate surprise parties

30:44.050 --> 30:46.469
and I especially hate this one.

30:48.388 --> 30:50.598
Why? Because Brandon
has a problem?

30:50.682 --> 30:52.725
{\an1}I'm starting to think
that Brandon is the reason

30:52.809 --> 30:54.561
{\an1}why you and I
haven't made love.

30:58.147 --> 30:58.940
(heavy sigh)

30:59.023 --> 31:02.485
Mark, I'm trying
to get over it, okay?

31:02.569 --> 31:06.948
But I don't think this has
anything to do with Brandon.

31:07.031 --> 31:09.909
Look, Kelly,
I'm sorry, all right?

31:09.993 --> 31:11.995
But it's just...
when I was a kid,

31:12.078 --> 31:15.665
my parents always made
this huge fuss about birthdays.

31:15.748 --> 31:17.625
{\an1}I mean, it was
always pony rides

31:17.709 --> 31:19.627
and magicians
and carnivals.

31:19.711 --> 31:20.962
And then it was baseball

31:21.045 --> 31:22.422
and then it was
rock 'n' roll.

31:22.505 --> 31:24.841
{\an1}Every year, it was
always something

31:24.924 --> 31:28.094
{\an1}that had to be
bigger and better.

31:28.177 --> 31:29.679
{\an1}And every year,
it always made me feel

31:29.762 --> 31:30.847
like more of a baby.

31:32.599 --> 31:34.309
I'm sorry.

31:34.392 --> 31:35.977
I should've listened to you.

31:36.060 --> 31:37.770
You told me you
wanted to be alone.

31:39.897 --> 31:42.317
Happy birthday.

31:47.614 --> 31:49.407
(quietly):
Yeah, happy birthday.

31:50.700 --> 31:52.160
{\an3}Hey, Trace, I'm getting
out of here.

31:52.243 --> 31:53.119
{\an3}Do you want
some company?

31:53.202 --> 31:54.954
{\an5}Yeah, sure.
Okay, let me
get my coat.

31:55.038 --> 31:55.872
Okay.

31:55.955 --> 31:57.999
{\an1}Brandon, I need to talk
to you for a second.

31:58.082 --> 31:59.250
{\an3}I'm just getting
out of here.

31:59.334 --> 32:00.501
Yeah, I know.

32:00.585 --> 32:02.837
{\an1}You have to do something
about you and Steve.

32:02.920 --> 32:03.838
He's really upset.

32:03.921 --> 32:05.673
Steve's feelings
are not foremost

32:05.757 --> 32:07.216
in my mind right now, Clare.

32:07.300 --> 32:08.509
After what he
did for you today?

32:08.593 --> 32:09.844
After what he did for me today?

32:09.927 --> 32:11.471
Let me tell you what
he did for me today.

32:11.554 --> 32:13.139
Steve killed me today.

32:13.222 --> 32:15.516
Now, I know Professor Randall
is my enemy,

32:15.600 --> 32:17.685
but I thought Steve was
supposed to be my friend.

32:19.103 --> 32:20.188
{\an3}TRACY:
Ready.

32:20.271 --> 32:22.440
{\an3}Good night, Clare.
Bye.

32:24.442 --> 32:25.860
What was that all about?

32:25.943 --> 32:28.571
Randall proved that Steve's been

32:28.655 --> 32:31.741
cheating off Brandon for years.

32:36.829 --> 32:39.165
Oh! I'm sleeping.

32:39.248 --> 32:40.291
So get up.

32:40.375 --> 32:41.751
(coughing):
I'm sick.

32:41.834 --> 32:44.253
{\an1}I'm sick--
I'm sick of this crap

32:44.337 --> 32:46.297
and I'm sick of
your lies, okay?

32:48.091 --> 32:49.884
I'm really sick
this time, Clare.

32:49.967 --> 32:52.553
{\an1}You know what?
I'm all out of sympathy, okay?

32:52.637 --> 32:53.846
{\an1}(groaning)
You know, maybe you think

32:53.930 --> 32:55.390
you can lie to Brandon,
lie to my dad,

32:55.473 --> 32:56.474
but you can't lie to me.

32:56.557 --> 32:58.059
{\an4}I didn't.
You told me
that, uh,

32:58.142 --> 32:59.519
you've never cheated
off Brandon before.

32:59.602 --> 33:01.562
Now I found out
you've been doing it for years.

33:01.646 --> 33:02.897
{\an1}But I haven't.
Really?

33:02.980 --> 33:04.357
{\an1}Well, Randall's
got proof, Steve.

33:04.440 --> 33:06.567
You cheated on the quizzes
in his class.

33:06.651 --> 33:07.735
Columbus Day Massacre?

33:07.819 --> 33:08.736
Uh, 84%?

33:08.820 --> 33:09.737
Ring any bells?

33:09.821 --> 33:11.531
No.

33:11.614 --> 33:12.407
It's so common for you,

33:12.490 --> 33:14.575
you can just cheat
and forget about it.

33:14.659 --> 33:16.369
Randall's sociology class?

33:16.452 --> 33:18.246
Friday quizzes?

33:18.329 --> 33:20.748
Yeah.
I failed that quiz.

33:20.832 --> 33:23.251
Sure.
You can prove it?

33:23.334 --> 33:24.252
(coughs)

33:24.335 --> 33:25.753
Yeah, I can.

33:25.837 --> 33:27.338
How? I mean, how can you prove

33:27.422 --> 33:29.132
that you flunked
that exact test?

33:29.215 --> 33:30.800
That's easy, Clare.

33:30.883 --> 33:32.427
I failed them all.

33:32.510 --> 33:34.303
{\an3}Come on.

33:34.387 --> 33:36.806
{\an3}About three years
ago, I, um...

33:36.889 --> 33:39.100
{\an3}I had a rather
torrid relationship

33:39.183 --> 33:41.269
{\an3}with a professor
at school.

33:41.352 --> 33:43.896
{\an3}Her name was
Lucinda Nicholson,

33:43.980 --> 33:48.234
and she was the wife of
Professor Cory Randall.

33:48.317 --> 33:51.612
They were separated
at the time, but...

33:51.696 --> 33:54.449
{\an3}guess that doesn't make
much of a difference.

33:54.532 --> 33:55.992
It was wrong.

33:56.075 --> 33:59.370
I knew it was wrong,
but I did it anyway.

34:01.372 --> 34:03.791
{\an1}Well, everybody's guilty
of something, Brandon.

34:03.875 --> 34:07.587
{\an3}Not people who have the goals
that I have-- or had.

34:07.670 --> 34:10.089
{\an3}I applied for a
Dryer Fellowship.

34:10.172 --> 34:12.759
{\an3}Guess I can kiss
that good-bye.

34:12.842 --> 34:15.178
{\an1}Oh, this is not
the end of the world.

34:15.261 --> 34:16.804
Hey, let's make a list

34:16.888 --> 34:19.306
{\an1}of famous people
that were expelled.

34:21.350 --> 34:23.436
Okay, I'll start.

34:23.518 --> 34:25.062
Jack the Ripper.

34:26.981 --> 34:28.690
There's got to be somebody.

34:30.193 --> 34:32.527
{\an3}You just don't
give up, do you?

34:32.612 --> 34:33.905
Family trait.

34:33.987 --> 34:36.991
{\an1}Try losing a crop to locusts
three years in a row.

34:37.074 --> 34:38.826
Will you still like me
after I'm disgraced?

34:38.909 --> 34:40.995
(chuckles)
Of course.

34:41.078 --> 34:42.621
Thanks.

35:10.107 --> 35:11.818
Hi.
Morning.

35:11.901 --> 35:13.653
Come in.

35:18.241 --> 35:19.909
{\an3}Uh, can I get
you some coffee?

35:19.992 --> 35:21.160
{\an1}Yes, sure.

35:21.244 --> 35:22.703
{\an1}Thank you.

35:25.998 --> 35:28.251
I, uh... I just wanted

35:28.334 --> 35:30.211
to come by and...

35:30.294 --> 35:31.879
{\an1}say I'm sorry about
the other night.

35:31.963 --> 35:34.882
{\an1}I didn't mean
to offend anybody.

35:34.966 --> 35:37.677
Well, thank you.

35:37.760 --> 35:40.346
But you did.

35:40.429 --> 35:41.722
I know.

35:41.806 --> 35:42.890
What can I say?

35:42.974 --> 35:45.852
I... I worry too much
about my little girl.

35:47.270 --> 35:49.438
I'm not so little.

35:52.149 --> 35:56.195
Donna, I know you feel deeply
about things, and...

35:56.279 --> 35:59.407
and I know think you have
feelings for David,

35:59.490 --> 36:02.785
{\an3}but honey, maybe he's just
another wounded bird.

36:02.869 --> 36:04.745
{\an3}Or deer.

36:04.829 --> 36:06.289
(sighs)

36:06.372 --> 36:08.624
{\an1}And this is your way
of apologizing?

36:09.667 --> 36:11.544
Look, Mother,

36:11.627 --> 36:14.130
I'm sorry to tell you, but it's
not pity that I feel for David.

36:14.213 --> 36:15.798
It's a hell of a lot more
than that.

36:15.882 --> 36:17.133
(wry laugh)

36:17.216 --> 36:18.259
Guess I should've
expected this.

36:18.342 --> 36:21.429
I mean, any time I say black,
you have to say white.

36:21.512 --> 36:23.431
Well, did it ever occur to you
that I might

36:23.514 --> 36:25.099
make a decision based
on my own feelings?

36:25.182 --> 36:28.102
Actually, it's typical that you
would think only of yourself.

36:28.185 --> 36:30.104
Gee, I thought it was my life.

36:30.187 --> 36:31.105
{\an3}Donna,

36:31.188 --> 36:33.149
you are so fond of telling me

36:33.232 --> 36:34.775
that you're not
a teenager anymore.

36:34.859 --> 36:36.611
{\an3}Don't you think it's
time you started

36:36.694 --> 36:38.613
thinking about
a serious relationship?

36:38.696 --> 36:40.406
I mean one with a future.

36:40.489 --> 36:42.783
Well, you know what,
for once, we agree,

36:42.867 --> 36:45.036
'cause that's exactly
what I'm doing.

36:48.998 --> 36:53.294
Members of the tribunal,
today I was to begin my defense.

36:53.377 --> 36:56.964
But I have to say...
I don't have one.

36:57.048 --> 36:58.341
Are you pleading guilty?

36:58.424 --> 37:00.760
No, sir, I am certainly not
pleading guilty;

37:00.843 --> 37:03.471
I'm merely saying
I don't believe

37:03.554 --> 37:06.390
Professor Randall has proven
any of the charges against me.

37:06.474 --> 37:07.683
Let the tribunal decide.

37:07.767 --> 37:08.893
I will.

37:08.976 --> 37:10.186
But I'm gonna
speak now, 'cause it is

37:10.269 --> 37:12.355
{\an1}my turn.

37:12.438 --> 37:14.273
{\an1}What has
Professor Randall proven?

37:14.357 --> 37:16.150
Well, he's proven
that Steve Sanders

37:16.233 --> 37:17.652
and myself were best friends.

37:17.735 --> 37:19.946
That's not news.

37:20.029 --> 37:22.990
Maybe he's proven that

37:23.074 --> 37:26.160
Steve is guilty of a crime
he's not charged with.

37:26.243 --> 37:27.995
If it please the court...

37:28.079 --> 37:30.706
Maybe it would please the court
for you to explain

37:30.790 --> 37:32.708
why you're out to smear me.

37:32.792 --> 37:34.335
What, you want to tell them

37:34.418 --> 37:36.504
{\an1}about the relationship
I had with your ex-wife?

37:36.587 --> 37:38.005
Go ahead; I don't care.

37:38.089 --> 37:41.509
{\an1}My personal life
is not on trial here.

37:44.762 --> 37:48.349
You want my defense?
Here it is.

37:48.432 --> 37:49.809
I didn't do it.

37:49.892 --> 37:51.227
That's my defense.

37:51.310 --> 37:53.437
You want proof?

37:54.897 --> 37:57.358
I say so.

37:57.441 --> 37:59.235
That's my proof.

37:59.318 --> 38:01.362
I have no witnesses.

38:01.445 --> 38:03.197
I have no evidence.

38:03.280 --> 38:04.699
All I have is my word.

38:04.782 --> 38:07.076
I didn't do it.

38:07.159 --> 38:08.411
I did not know

38:08.494 --> 38:11.080
that Steve Sanders
took my paper.

38:11.163 --> 38:15.126
And if this university chooses
not to believe me, that's fine.

38:15.209 --> 38:18.838
That's all I can do.

38:21.340 --> 38:24.051
I'm ready to accept the judgment
of the tribunal.

38:27.304 --> 38:29.932
Professor Randall,
any closing argument?

38:30.016 --> 38:31.350
Waived.

38:31.434 --> 38:33.227
Well, I... We will, uh...

38:33.310 --> 38:34.395
{\an3}(coughing)
Hold on a second.

38:34.478 --> 38:36.022
I got... I got to say something.

38:36.105 --> 38:38.024
You have to leave here
right away, and Clare,

38:38.107 --> 38:39.734
{\an5}you shouldn't
be here at all.
But I've got things here...

38:39.817 --> 38:42.278
{\an5}Steve out, now!
Steve, whatever
you were going to do, don't.

38:42.361 --> 38:43.279
Just get out of here.

38:43.362 --> 38:46.032
{\an3}Well, according to the
Student Code of Conduct,

38:46.115 --> 38:47.199
a witness can petition

38:47.283 --> 38:49.994
to return to clarify
his testimony, so...

38:50.077 --> 38:51.370
Yeah.

38:51.454 --> 38:53.122
I object.
Overruled.

38:53.205 --> 38:53.914
What is it, Steve?

38:53.998 --> 38:55.958
That test he said
I cheated on--

38:56.042 --> 38:57.585
I failed that test--
Columbus Day.

38:57.668 --> 38:59.754
I failed it.
I tanked huge!

38:59.837 --> 39:01.630
Objection. This wasn't part
of his initial testimony.

39:01.714 --> 39:02.798
{\an3}ARNOLD:
Overruled.

39:02.882 --> 39:04.425
I'd like to hear more.

39:04.508 --> 39:06.302
The course ledger said
you got...

39:06.385 --> 39:11.057
eighty-four.

39:11.140 --> 39:12.433
{\an3}Oh, funny.
That's not what

39:12.516 --> 39:13.225
{\an6}it says on my quiz.
CLARE:
Mm-hmm.

39:13.309 --> 39:14.769
Look-- 17.

39:14.852 --> 39:17.146
Okay, so maybe
I got the date wrong.

39:17.229 --> 39:18.481
{\an3}Oh, no, I failed
them all,

39:18.564 --> 39:19.607
Randy. (chuckles)

39:19.690 --> 39:22.610
October 18: 17.

39:22.693 --> 39:25.446
November 22: 46.

39:25.529 --> 39:30.618
December 5-- an oldie,
but a goodie-- 13.

39:30.701 --> 39:31.744
Good thing
attendance counts, huh?

39:31.827 --> 39:32.745
{\an1}(chuckles)

39:32.828 --> 39:35.081
Where did these tests
appear from magically,

39:35.164 --> 39:36.624
{\an3}just in the nick
of time?

39:36.707 --> 39:38.667
Students save their old exams
for study sessions later.

39:42.546 --> 39:44.006
I am appalled.

39:45.216 --> 39:46.801
I'm appalled
that you would pervert

39:46.884 --> 39:48.135
the honor of this university

39:48.219 --> 39:50.471
{\an3}by manufacturing
evidence.

39:50.554 --> 39:51.472
All of the charges

39:51.555 --> 39:53.265
against Brandon Walsh
are summarily dismissed.

39:53.349 --> 39:54.975
{\an3}And you will
have a hearing

39:55.059 --> 39:57.603
{\an3}to look forward to of
your own, very shortly.

39:57.686 --> 39:59.897
This session is adjourned.

40:02.191 --> 40:04.402
Sounds like
the fat lady singing to me.

40:11.033 --> 40:11.992
{\an3}We spent half
the night

40:12.076 --> 40:14.328
crawling through the KEG
attic looking for them.

40:14.411 --> 40:15.955
Yeah, but it
was worth it.

40:16.038 --> 40:18.833
{\an5}You should have seen the look
on Randall's face.
Yeah.

40:18.916 --> 40:19.500
Hmm.

40:19.583 --> 40:20.668
{\an4}BRANDON:
Hey, guys.
Brandon!

40:20.751 --> 40:22.169
{\an1}Speech, speech,
speech.

40:22.253 --> 40:23.838
Thank you, thank you,
thank you very much.

40:23.921 --> 40:25.131
Okay, okay, look,

40:25.214 --> 40:26.841
I just want
to thank everyone

40:26.924 --> 40:28.134
for standing by me
through this.

40:28.217 --> 40:29.343
I know it was tough.

40:29.426 --> 40:31.345
And, uh, Mark,
I owe you an apology, man.

40:31.428 --> 40:33.013
{\an3}I didn't get to say
happy birthday

40:33.097 --> 40:34.473
to you on your birthday,
so happy birthday.

40:34.557 --> 40:36.100
Thanks, man.

40:36.183 --> 40:38.185
{\an4}I'm sorry if I bummed out
your party.
No, that's okay.

40:38.269 --> 40:40.354
{\an3}It turned out to be a pretty
interesting birthday,

40:40.437 --> 40:41.188
didn't it, Kel?

40:41.272 --> 40:44.233
{\an1}Yeah, I learned
a lot about kung fu.

40:45.234 --> 40:46.193
Hey, Brandon,

40:46.277 --> 40:48.195
{\an3}as long as you're
apologizing...

40:48.279 --> 40:49.655
{\an3}Uh, no,
I should go first.

40:49.738 --> 40:51.866
No, I got to, uh...
I gotta thank you, man.

40:51.949 --> 40:55.119
You really, you really pulled
my fat out of the fire-- thanks.

40:55.202 --> 40:56.704
I did, didn't I?

40:56.787 --> 40:58.164
Of course,
you set that fire...

40:58.247 --> 41:01.834
I did that, too.

41:01.917 --> 41:03.043
I'm sorry. Forgive me?

41:03.127 --> 41:05.880
I'd just rather forget this
whole thing ever happened, bro.

41:05.963 --> 41:07.965
{\an1}Hug me.

41:12.928 --> 41:14.597
{\an1}A good example
of men communicating.

41:14.680 --> 41:15.472
Yep, a Megaburger

41:15.556 --> 41:17.641
{\an3}and a manly hug
and all's forgiven.

41:18.642 --> 41:19.560
What's your point?

41:19.643 --> 41:21.604
{\an1}You know,
the only thing

41:21.687 --> 41:24.190
that I can't figure out is
how could Randall have forgotten

41:24.273 --> 41:26.066
about the fraternity files?

41:26.150 --> 41:28.235
He probably figured that
anyone who did so poorly

41:28.319 --> 41:30.571
{\an3}on those exams would be
too humiliated to keep them.

41:30.654 --> 41:32.114
{\an1}But he didn't count
on the fact

41:32.198 --> 41:34.408
{\an3}that no one can humiliate
Steve Sanders more

41:34.491 --> 41:37.912
{\an3}than he can humiliate
himself because...

41:37.995 --> 41:40.247
STEVE and BRANDON:
Steve Sanders has no shame!

41:40.331 --> 41:42.166
(both laugh)

41:44.460 --> 41:45.836
{\an1}Did you see
where David went?

41:45.920 --> 41:47.796
{\an1}Hmm?
David-- where'd he go?

41:47.880 --> 41:49.256
No.

42:08.692 --> 42:11.987
{\an3}You really want this
place, don't you?

42:16.033 --> 42:17.868
It's kinda hard to say no.

42:19.828 --> 42:21.288
{\an3}I know.

42:21.372 --> 42:25.751
{\an3}I mean, you could be back
in the music business,

42:25.834 --> 42:27.795
{\an3}find bands,
produce them,

42:27.878 --> 42:29.838
{\an3}maybe even start
playing again.

42:33.259 --> 42:35.344
Not if the price
is too high.

42:39.556 --> 42:41.308
Well, you have the money.

42:42.893 --> 42:45.229
It's not the cost
I'm worried about.

42:50.526 --> 42:52.361
{\an3}Should we talk about what's
really bothering you?

42:55.572 --> 42:57.157
No, I'm just, I'm just worried

42:57.241 --> 42:59.827
about you taking
on too much too soon.

43:02.579 --> 43:05.249
Come on, Donna,
there's more to it than that.

43:06.750 --> 43:07.751
All right.

43:09.378 --> 43:10.796
It's Valerie.

43:10.879 --> 43:16.010
{\an1}Just knowing that
you guys were together once,

43:16.093 --> 43:19.346
it's hard for me to imagine
you two working so closely now.

43:19.430 --> 43:22.182
I'm not interested in Valerie.

43:24.143 --> 43:26.854
You're the one I care about.

43:26.937 --> 43:28.355
You're the one I love.

43:30.107 --> 43:31.567
Do you mean that?

43:33.110 --> 43:35.279
With all my heart.

43:37.448 --> 43:38.907
I'm glad.

43:41.243 --> 43:43.287
Now buy the club.
