00:23.727 --> 00:26.726
So the salesman says,
"Try the cleats."

00:26.761 --> 00:29.962
I said, "What do I need cleats for?
I work in a tollbooth for God's sake."

00:29.997 --> 00:32.290
- They just want the commission.
- Exactly.

00:32.326 --> 00:38.344
- It's all about volume to them.
- Janet buys all her shoes by mail.

00:38.379 --> 00:41.177
You know, I don't get that.
How do you buy shoes by mail?

00:41.212 --> 00:44.126
I gotta walk around in them.
I've gotta walk around the block.

00:44.161 --> 00:46.856
How you doing?
Out of 10.

00:46.891 --> 00:49.022
Are you Pulaski? - Yeah.

00:49.057 --> 00:51.126
Frank Pulaski?

00:51.161 --> 00:54.471
- That's right. Do I know you?
- Just give me my change.

00:55.636 --> 00:58.029
- Hey! What the hell is this?
- What... Wh

00:58.064 --> 00:59.771
- What happened?
- Hey!

00:59.806 --> 01:02.905
Help, Tommy! That guy!
I can't get it off! Do something!

01:02.940 --> 01:06.537
- I'm trying here!
- Tommy! No!

01:06.572 --> 01:08.817
- No!
- Oh, my...

01:10.529 --> 01:12.980
MONK Season 2 Epi. 09
Mr. Monk and the 12th Man

02:19.095 --> 02:20.770
Oh, my God!

02:20.805 --> 02:23.570
Oh, my God. Look at this.
Look at this on page 10.

02:23.605 --> 02:27.431
That's me and Kenny at
the fund-raiser he took me to.

02:27.466 --> 02:29.253
Mrs. Ling?

02:29.288 --> 02:33.239
- Hello, it's 10:00.
- Adrian? Adrian? See that tie?

02:33.274 --> 02:35.034
I picked it out for him. - Mm-hmm.

02:35.069 --> 02:38.076
He said he trusted my taste.

02:39.538 --> 02:42.580
Imagine spending time with a man
who actually cares about what I think.

02:42.615 --> 02:44.158
Uh-huh.

02:44.193 --> 02:46.069
Mrs. Ling?

02:46.104 --> 02:48.521
- 10:00! Hello?
- Adrian, Adrian, listen to this.

02:48.556 --> 02:49.839
Listen, listen.

02:49.874 --> 02:53.680
"Deputy Mayor Kenny Shale with
an unidentified friend..." That's me.

02:53.715 --> 02:56.897
"Seen Friday night
at the Gala Children's Fund Benefit.

02:56.932 --> 02:59.147
"Mr. Shale is being touted
by many pundits

02:59.182 --> 03:04.377
as a possible candidate...
in next year's mayoral election."

03:04.412 --> 03:06.256
You know what that means? - No.

03:06.291 --> 03:08.787
I could be dating the next
mayor of San Francisco.

03:08.822 --> 03:11.180
I thought you didn't like Kenny.

03:11.215 --> 03:13.444
I don't know.
I changed my mind.

03:13.479 --> 03:16.637
Oh, my God.
I've got to get more copies.

03:17.739 --> 03:22.212
Mr. Monk, I tell you before.
Do not ring the bell.

03:22.920 --> 03:25.943
- Stop that!
- It's 10:00, Mrs. Ling.

03:25.978 --> 03:29.793
- The ticket says, "Tuesday, 10 a. m."
- It's an approximation, Mr. Monk.

03:29.828 --> 03:33.606
It means "about 10:00."
Not at 10:00, you crazy man.

03:33.641 --> 03:36.891
What's wrong with you?
Okay, give me your ticket.

03:38.221 --> 03:41.643
Oh, Mr. Monk,
I told you before, no copies.

03:41.678 --> 03:45.781
- Where's the original ticket?
- It's safe at home in my file.

03:45.816 --> 03:49.708
What do you need a file for?
This is dry cleaning ticket!

03:49.743 --> 03:51.660
Stop that.

03:52.977 --> 03:54.725
Why you let him xerox?

03:54.760 --> 03:58.142
- I'm not with him every minute.
- Oh, okay. Here you go.

03:58.177 --> 04:00.154
Four shirts, okay?

04:00.189 --> 04:03.075
That's $24.

04:03.110 --> 04:06.357
- Why do I pay more?
- Because you're so much trouble, okay.

04:06.392 --> 04:09.002
I got to clean everything twice.
Then I got to stand here

04:09.037 --> 04:13.689
and talk to you for like half an hour.
Okay, good. Thank you. Bye-bye, now.

04:13.724 --> 04:16.630
Thank you, Mrs. Ling.
Thank you. - Wait.

04:16.665 --> 04:20.392
- What is it now?
- Well, this is all wrinkled.

04:20.428 --> 04:22.564
Well, it's cellophane.
It's gonna get wrinkled.

04:22.599 --> 04:24.994
- That's cellophane, crazy man!
- Come on.

04:25.029 --> 04:28.301
- What... What's this?
- Oh, that? Th-That's nothing.

04:28.336 --> 04:30.489
- Okay, bye-bye, now. Bye-bye.
- Go. Let's go.

04:30.524 --> 04:33.714
This isn't my button.

04:33.749 --> 04:36.837
Your button fall off.
But I found a new one.

04:36.872 --> 04:41.509
- Identical, no difference.
- Looks the same to me.

04:43.090 --> 04:46.500
The button matches,
but the stitching is all different.

04:46.535 --> 04:51.232
See? O-On the other ones,
the thread is crisscrossed.

04:51.267 --> 04:55.150
- But here, look. It's parallel!
- That's how I sew them.

04:55.185 --> 04:59.408
- Parallel! That's my style.
- But it doesn't match.

04:59.443 --> 05:02.449
- I have to live in this town!
- All right fine. We'll be right there.

05:02.484 --> 05:05.155
Hey, another job.

05:05.190 --> 05:07.577
I've got a good mind to take
my business elsewhere.

05:07.612 --> 05:11.016
Oh, please, do, okay.
Quit me, okay. Bye-bye!

05:11.051 --> 05:15.352
No, no. Relax, Mrs. Ling.
I was... I was just kidding.

05:15.387 --> 05:17.702
Just kidding. You're the best
dry cleaner in the city.

05:17.737 --> 05:21.356
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Adrian, stop that...

05:21.391 --> 05:22.480
Handcuffed?

05:22.515 --> 05:25.136
Handcuffed to one wrist
and tied to 70 feet of rope.

05:25.171 --> 05:28.855
- Oh, God!
- And then he was dragged west

05:28.890 --> 05:32.192
seven-tenths of a mile.
I just saw the body or what's left of it.

05:32.227 --> 05:34.506
- Oh, God.
- The M. E. Said he's never

05:34.541 --> 05:36.678
seen anything like it.

05:36.713 --> 05:38.654
- There's no end to it.
- What do you mean?

05:38.689 --> 05:41.214
I mean, this is number nine.
Nine bizarre murders

05:41.249 --> 05:43.682
in the past two weeks.
Every time my beeper goes off,

05:43.717 --> 05:45.842
- my heart skips a beat.
- Are they connected?

05:45.877 --> 05:49.358
No. No connection at all.
I mean, four have been men,

05:49.393 --> 05:53.268
five women, all different ages.
Latino, white, black.

05:53.303 --> 05:55.464
- And the M. O.'s?
- All different.

05:55.499 --> 05:58.298
There's been a couple of shootings,
different weapons, a hit-and-run,

05:58.333 --> 06:01.397
a drowning, an electrocution.
I mean, it's-it's-it's like

06:01.432 --> 06:04.793
- a full moon every night.
- And you're sure that the cases

06:04.828 --> 06:07.095
have absolutely nothing
in common?

06:07.130 --> 06:08.625
Well, they have one thing
in common, Monk.

06:08.660 --> 06:12.198
We can't solve them.
I swear, there's something in the water.

06:12.233 --> 06:14.468
Saw the picture of you
and your new boyfriend.

06:14.503 --> 06:17.335
He's not my boyfriend. - Hmm.

06:17.370 --> 06:20.534
I was thinking of voting for him, but,
uh, now I worry about his judgment.

06:20.569 --> 06:23.826
I mean, if he's going out with you,
there's no telling what else he might do.

06:23.861 --> 06:27.555
- Start a nuclear war or something.
- I'll tell him that you said that.

06:27.590 --> 06:32.535
- No, don't. Just... I was joking.
- Then I'll tell him you were joking.

06:32.570 --> 06:36.165
No, d-don't say that.
Just don't say anything.

06:36.200 --> 06:38.960
- I brought you some coffee.
- Thank you. I appreciate it.

06:38.995 --> 06:43.408
- Actually, it's for Sharona.
- Oh, thanks.

06:43.443 --> 06:46.417
Tell Kenny I say "Hi." - I will.

06:48.450 --> 06:50.421
He stayed on his feet
as long as he could.

06:50.456 --> 06:56.475
Then he fell, dragged away.
I could hear him screaming and begging.

06:56.510 --> 07:00.051
It could have been me.
It should have been me.

07:00.086 --> 07:02.453
- What do you mean?
- I was wide open.

07:02.488 --> 07:06.610
- Frankie had three cars in line.
- Wait. You were wide open?

07:06.645 --> 07:12.319
But the killer went to Mr. Pulaski's
booth and waited in line? - Yeah.

07:12.354 --> 07:16.706
- Why would he do that unless...
- He was after that particular guy.

07:18.331 --> 07:22.605
So, you didn't see the driver,
and you didn't get a make of the car?

07:22.640 --> 07:25.578
Sorry. It might have been
a Chrysler. I'm not sure.

07:25.613 --> 07:30.036
- Captain, what's this?
- The killer paid his toll with that.

07:30.071 --> 07:33.947
That's supposed to be at the lab.
Lieutenant?

07:33.982 --> 07:37.751
Hey! Hey, guys.
What is this, a high school dance?

07:37.786 --> 07:39.757
Give the girl some room.
Let her breathe. Come here.

07:39.792 --> 07:41.844
I want to talk to you.

07:41.879 --> 07:45.987
I understand that you
are seeing Kenny Shale.

07:46.022 --> 07:48.986
- Oh, it's nothing serious.
- Yes, it is.

07:49.021 --> 07:53.316
I wanna tell you something,
Sharona. Your life is about to change.

07:53.351 --> 07:57.173
Everybody you know
is gonna want a piece of you.

07:57.208 --> 08:01.289
You're not going to know who to trust.
Monk can't help you with this, all right?

08:01.324 --> 08:04.726
- Mm-hmm.
- He's... He's brilliant, but he's Monk.

08:04.761 --> 08:07.118
- He's lost in Monkland.
- Mm-hmm.

08:07.153 --> 08:10.603
Now, I've been where you are.
I've been in the spotlight.

08:10.638 --> 08:15.572
And... Well, here.
I want you to take that.

08:15.607 --> 08:17.338
- What is it?
- That's my cell phone number,

08:17.373 --> 08:21.617
okay? You call me 24-7
if you need anything.

08:21.652 --> 08:23.836
Yeah. I just don't
want to see you get hurt.

08:23.871 --> 08:27.316
Oh. Thanks a lot. Thanks. - Yeah.

08:27.351 --> 08:33.155
Oh, I was thinking, um,
maybe we could get together,

08:33.191 --> 08:36.589
do a double date kind of thing.
Me and Karen, you and Kenny?

08:36.624 --> 08:39.340
I've always liked Kenny.
Kenny, he's... He's a good guy.

08:39.375 --> 08:42.683
- He's good people.
- You called him a weasel.

08:42.717 --> 08:45.253
- No, I didn't.
- Yeah, you did, three weeks ago.

08:45.288 --> 08:49.412
No, I never said "weasel."
I said he was a... a w...

08:49.447 --> 08:53.784
Oh, yeah, I said "weasel."
I called him a weasel.

08:53.819 --> 08:56.162
But then, you see, I...
That's not a bad thing.

08:56.197 --> 09:00.128
I had a weasel. A weasel
is a noble animal, all right.

09:00.163 --> 09:04.007
It's... It's a term of endearment. Jerry!
Hey, how you doing, you weasel?

09:04.042 --> 09:06.216
Good to see you.
See, I call everybody a weasel.

09:06.251 --> 09:07.540
Captain.

09:07.575 --> 09:09.273
Captain, look at this.

09:10.322 --> 09:14.710
His coin tray was almost empty.
He was just starting his shift?

09:14.745 --> 09:18.320
- That's right. He was.
- So the killer had to have been waiting

09:18.355 --> 09:23.350
- for Pulaski to come on duty.
- That's right. I remember.

09:23.385 --> 09:25.778
The guy was parked
over there by the call box

09:25.813 --> 09:28.073
for about 20 minutes. - Hmm.

09:29.155 --> 09:33.845
So he was waiting?
What do you think, Sharona?

09:36.013 --> 09:39.138
Me? - Yeah.

09:40.903 --> 09:44.294
She's dating Kenny Shale,
who's running for mayor.

09:44.329 --> 09:47.389
Yeah, I know.
L... I've been reading about him.

09:47.424 --> 09:53.164
I don't think she really likes him.
I think she just likes all the attention.

09:53.199 --> 09:57.604
Everyone in the department
has been fawning over her,

09:57.639 --> 10:04.958
laughing at her jokes, getting her coffee.
- Maybe you should be happy for her.

10:04.993 --> 10:09.748
- Can I tell you something?
- Yeah, that's why we're here.

10:09.783 --> 10:12.267
The last few days,
I find myself thinking...

10:12.302 --> 10:17.875
that if Kenny Shale is elected
and Sharona is still with him,

10:18.440 --> 10:21.229
maybe... she could...

10:21.264 --> 10:27.493
She could help to get you
reinstated to the department.

10:28.441 --> 10:31.917
- I'm as bad as any of them.
- Oh, Adrian, no, no, no.

10:31.952 --> 10:34.424
You see, there's nothing wrong
with being ambitious.

10:34.459 --> 10:36.998
It just means that you're human.

10:37.033 --> 10:38.945
Human.

10:40.053 --> 10:43.643
It's been a long time since
anybody's called me that.

10:45.337 --> 10:48.497
- What's wrong with your shirt?
- Nothing.

10:48.532 --> 10:53.642
- W-W-Why are you holding it like that?
- I put on the wrong shirt.

10:53.677 --> 10:57.104
What? There's a stain? Because, see,
I don't... I don't see anything.

10:57.139 --> 11:00.277
It's the button.
Mrs. Ling sewed it back on.

11:00.312 --> 11:03.429
- The stitching is all different.
- The-The... The stitching?

11:03.464 --> 11:05.878
It's not crisscrossed.!
It's parallel.

11:05.913 --> 11:10.038
D-Don't... Don't pretend
you don't see it.

11:39.388 --> 11:42.117
Arlene?

11:42.152 --> 11:44.095
Arlene Carney?

11:44.130 --> 11:45.539
Yes?

11:45.574 --> 11:49.171
- How are you, Arlene?
- Who is that?

12:02.295 --> 12:06.592
The lady... Well, the dead lady,
sh-she bought a ticket...

12:06.627 --> 12:09.702
Did she appear to be
waiting for somebody? - No, sir.

12:09.737 --> 12:13.484
- Did she look frightened?
- No, sir.

12:13.519 --> 12:18.664
It fell off... and the dry cleaner
sewed it on wrong.

12:18.699 --> 12:22.245
- Sir?
- Weren't you staring at my button?

12:22.280 --> 12:25.219
- No, sir.
- Whatever.

12:25.254 --> 12:27.623
- We haven't met. I'm Chuck Evered.
- The theater manager.

12:27.658 --> 12:31.592
Adrian Monk.
Sharona? Sharon... Sharona?

12:31.627 --> 12:34.013
If you're looking for Jackie O.,
she's over there.

12:34.048 --> 12:37.028
You know, Kenny took me to city hall
last night, and we had dinner

12:37.063 --> 12:41.888
- in the private dining room.
- Wow, really?

12:41.923 --> 12:45.908
Maybe I'll bring you next time.
Kenny might need a bodyguard.

12:48.134 --> 12:51.790
Hello? Hi, Kenny.

12:51.825 --> 12:54.604
Whoa, guys! Guys, keep it
down. Her Royal Highness

12:54.639 --> 12:59.658
is talking to Mr. Kenny Shale.
Go ahead.

12:59.693 --> 13:01.298
- No, no, no. It's nothing...
- Go ahead, kid.

13:01.333 --> 13:05.053
- You're doing fine.
- So, she goes inside, and about

13:05.088 --> 13:08.650
- a minute later, a man steps up.
- Can you describe him?

13:08.685 --> 13:11.508
- I couldn't really see his face.
- He was holding a handkerchief

13:11.543 --> 13:15.900
over his mouth like he had a cold.
He bought a ticket for the same movie.

13:15.935 --> 13:18.851
And... And I asked him if he
wanted the combo special,

13:18.886 --> 13:21.784
which is a large popcorn
and a medium drink.

13:21.819 --> 13:28.590
A $9 value at only 7.50. H-He said no.
And then he went inside and killed her,

13:28.625 --> 13:31.913
which I had no idea
he was planning to do.

13:31.948 --> 13:35.422
- And he paid you with this?
- Yes, sir.

13:35.457 --> 13:38.163
Great, thanks a lot. You need to
go downtown and talk to a sketch artist.

13:38.198 --> 13:41.833
Jerry? Officer Johnson
will give you a ride.

13:44.658 --> 13:46.614
Captain? - What?

13:46.649 --> 13:50.321
- You've got a serial killer on your hands.
- Monk, the woman was strangled.

13:50.356 --> 13:55.336
She didn't know any of the other victims.
I am not crying wolf until I am 100% sure.

13:55.371 --> 13:59.367
This is definitely the same man that
killed Frank Pulaski at the toll booth.

13:59.402 --> 14:02.344
- A lot of people pay with $10 bills.
- It's brand-new.

14:02.379 --> 14:04.963
There are a lot of brand-new tens
out there right now.

14:04.998 --> 14:07.462
The serial numbers are sequential.

14:09.013 --> 14:13.894
- What? You remember that?
- Well, I got a pretty good look at it.

14:13.929 --> 14:20.637
The bill at the toll booth
ended with 6092B. This is 6093B.

14:20.672 --> 14:23.074
A serial killer.

14:28.591 --> 14:31.553
Captain.

14:31.588 --> 14:36.042
Washington just sent this down.
It's a prelim psych profile.

14:36.077 --> 14:37.947
Let me guess.

14:37.982 --> 14:43.614
The killer is between
30 and 45 years old, white male,

14:43.649 --> 14:46.869
does not work in an office,
probably spent time in the military...

14:46.904 --> 14:50.441
and definitely hates his mother.

14:50.476 --> 14:52.100
Yeah. How'd you know?

14:52.135 --> 14:55.518
Because that's what they always say.
That's scrap paper.

14:55.553 --> 14:57.488
What about the $ 10 bills?
Anything on them?

14:57.523 --> 15:01.569
They're from a bank in San Mateo.
Wells Fargo, untraceable.

15:01.604 --> 15:05.804
Of course they are.
All right, everybody, listen up!

15:05.839 --> 15:06.840
Listen up!

15:06.875 --> 15:09.623
We're not gonna find him
flailing around in the dark.

15:09.658 --> 15:12.462
Let's communicate,
keep each other briefed.

15:12.497 --> 15:15.601
We're going Dumpster diving.
We're gonna...

15:15.636 --> 15:18.057
What are you doing?
What is that?

15:18.092 --> 15:20.491
I'm leaving a space
for the next victim.

15:20.526 --> 15:23.838
Take that down.
Take it down.

15:23.873 --> 15:25.696
There is no next victim.
We're stopping

15:25.731 --> 15:27.552
the son of a bitch at 10.

15:30.784 --> 15:33.422
Well, thank you.
Thank you.

15:33.457 --> 15:35.002
Sharona!

15:35.037 --> 15:36.306
Are you cold?

15:36.341 --> 15:39.663
- Here you go.
- Oh, thank you, Kevin.

15:39.698 --> 15:43.347
- Sharona! Look at this. Look.
- Sharona Fleming? Look.

15:43.382 --> 15:47.682
- Oh, yes, I'm Sharona Fleming.
- These are from, uh, Kenny Shale.

15:47.717 --> 15:50.637
Oh, my God.
They're beautiful. Thank you.

15:50.672 --> 15:52.962
Let me get you a vase for these.- Okay.

15:52.997 --> 15:58.644
Sharona! Hello? Hey...
Sharon... Sharona, look.

15:58.679 --> 16:02.221
Miss Fleming?

16:02.256 --> 16:05.544
Lieutenant? Captain?
Captain, can I show you something?

16:05.579 --> 16:08.857
Look, Lieutenant.
Look at this one,

16:08.892 --> 16:13.129
- this one and that one.
- Yeah, the calendars.

16:13.164 --> 16:13.940
Exactly.

16:13.975 --> 16:16.842
These three have the same
calendar on their wall.

16:16.877 --> 16:20.790
Yeah, we noticed that yesterday, Monk.
Come here. I want to show you something.

16:26.930 --> 16:31.405
They send me one of those every year.
Probably print a million of them.

16:31.440 --> 16:34.318
Actually, they print 25,000.
I talked to the insurance

16:34.353 --> 16:36.357
company last night.
It's a single office,

16:36.392 --> 16:40.778
mom and pop operation,
still owned by Mr. Henry Smalls.

16:40.813 --> 16:43.997
It can't be a coincidence.
Captain, three of them,

16:44.032 --> 16:48.216
maybe more, with
the exact same calendar.

16:48.251 --> 16:50.080
We at least have to
check this guy out.

16:50.115 --> 16:52.362
We already did.
Lieutenant?

16:52.397 --> 16:55.567
Henry Smalls, 47 years old.
He's been away for the last

16:55.602 --> 16:58.649
two weeks at an insurance
convention in Baltimore.

16:58.684 --> 17:01.519
- He's due back tonight.
- He's been out of town, Monk.

17:01.554 --> 17:05.282
Okay, okay. But maybe
he's the common denominator.

17:05.318 --> 17:09.106
Maybe you might be right. But I
cannot put this on the top of my pile.

17:09.141 --> 17:11.605
I have 700 leads.
At least half of them

17:11.640 --> 17:14.934
are stronger than this is.
I will get to that, eventually, I promise.

17:14.969 --> 17:19.054
- But he's coming home tonight.
- I said eventually.

17:23.262 --> 17:25.194
- Did I miss anything?
- No, nothing much.

17:25.230 --> 17:28.290
We're just trying to catch
a serial killer before he strikes again.

17:28.325 --> 17:31.783
Hardly worth mentioning really.
Listen, there's a possible lead.

17:31.818 --> 17:34.768
You and I are going to stake out
the guy's house later.

17:34.803 --> 17:36.499
You mean tonight? - Yeah.

17:36.534 --> 17:38.897
I can't. This is Kenny's only night off.

17:38.932 --> 17:42.386
Adrian, I told you three days ago that
I needed tonight off.

17:42.421 --> 17:45.108
Sharona, this guy's coming home tonight.
I have to talk to him.

17:45.143 --> 17:47.921
Okay, so who's stopping you?
You don't need me.

17:47.956 --> 17:50.474
I don't need you?
Haven't you been paying attention

17:50.509 --> 17:53.391
- for the last three years?
- Hire a Kelly girl.

17:53.426 --> 17:54.779
A what? - A temp.

17:54.814 --> 17:58.135
You pay them by the hour.
They'll do anything.

17:58.170 --> 18:01.687
- I can't bring a temp on a stakeout!
- Oh! All I know is that

18:01.722 --> 18:06.869
- I'm seeing Kenny tonight.
- And I'm going on that stakeout.

18:10.048 --> 18:14.738
Yeah, that's the house.
Number 782.

18:14.773 --> 18:17.498
- He'll be home any minute.
- I finally got you in the backseat,

18:17.533 --> 18:20.268
and after only three dates.

18:20.303 --> 18:24.370
Um, Kenny, uh,
you've got to behave yourself.

18:24.405 --> 18:26.693
This is official police business,
you know what I mean?

18:26.728 --> 18:28.869
I am so sorry.
I'm just so excited.

18:28.904 --> 18:31.758
This is my first stakeout.
Oh, right.

18:31.793 --> 18:35.668
Well, I brought you some doughnuts.
Oh. Real stakeout food.

18:35.703 --> 18:39.609
Okay. And I brought the vino.
Now, this wine is 30 years old.

18:39.644 --> 18:43.656
So, let's not let it live
another minute, okay?

18:43.691 --> 18:47.705
Doughnuts and red wine.
This might be the best date I ever had.

18:47.740 --> 18:51.379
Here, baby, take this.
Hey, Adrian, thanks again for inviting me.

18:51.414 --> 18:55.963
- Don't make a mess back there.
- It's my car.

18:55.998 --> 19:00.771
That's true. Don't make
a mess back there.

19:00.806 --> 19:06.241
Hello? Yes, sir.
Thursday's perfect.

19:06.276 --> 19:08.652
Yes, sir, I'll see you there.

19:08.687 --> 19:13.254
Well, yes, sir, she's right here.

19:13.289 --> 19:15.512
I'll tell her.
Yes, sir. Thank you.

19:15.547 --> 19:17.176
The governor says hi.

19:17.211 --> 19:18.900
- That was the governor?
- Mm-hmm.

19:18.935 --> 19:21.073
- He said hi to me?
- Yes, he did.

19:21.108 --> 19:24.891
- Adrian, did you hear that?
- Did he happen to mention me?

19:24.926 --> 19:30.546
- I met him during the campaign.
- No. No, he didn't. Mmm!

19:30.581 --> 19:35.189
Saved his life,
got him elected, that's all.

19:35.224 --> 19:39.023
Kenny, has Sharona told you
about some of the cases

19:39.058 --> 19:43.745
I've been working on?
You know, I, uh...

19:43.780 --> 19:49.560
I could do so much more
if I was, uh, officially reinstated.

19:49.595 --> 19:52.892
- Mmm. Isn't that good?
- No, it... But not...

19:52.927 --> 19:56.019
Kenny, not now.
I told you, remember? Not now.

19:56.054 --> 20:00.104
- Adrian, what are you doing?
- The odometer's 9999.

20:00.139 --> 20:03.864
I'm trying to get it to zero. - Why?

20:03.899 --> 20:05.666
So...

20:05.701 --> 20:09.243
- then it'll be at zero.
- But w-will that work?

20:09.278 --> 20:11.739
Do the numbers change if you just
go backwards and forwards?

20:11.774 --> 20:14.601
It's changing. Look.

20:14.636 --> 20:17.211
There it goes.

20:17.246 --> 20:21.797
- It's not moving.
- Yeah, it's moving. It's moving.

20:23.080 --> 20:27.272
Oh, no. Oh, God! Oh, no!
Look out behind you.!

20:27.307 --> 20:30.235
Look out! Look out!
Henry Smalls!

20:30.904 --> 20:31.872
Henry Smalls!

20:31.907 --> 20:34.875
- Adrian! What are you doing?
- I don't know!

20:58.484 --> 21:02.301
It's number 11, damn it.

21:02.336 --> 21:05.241
All right, nobody's going home.
I want to know how many

21:05.276 --> 21:07.838
of our victims knew
Mr. Henry Smalls.

21:07.873 --> 21:10.582
We're gonna revisit
every crime scene, every house.

21:10.617 --> 21:15.378
We huddle back here at 0900.
Go. Go!

21:18.736 --> 21:21.503
You okay? - Yeah.

21:21.538 --> 21:23.514
What happened to your hands?
You hurt both of your hands?

21:23.549 --> 21:26.650
No, just the left one.

21:26.685 --> 21:29.201
Why do you have bandages on both?

21:30.355 --> 21:31.579
Right.

21:31.614 --> 21:35.262
Symmetry.
Where is our future mayor?

21:35.297 --> 21:37.775
He went home.
He was pretty shaken up.

21:37.810 --> 21:40.087
- I'll bet he is.
- Grace under pressure.

21:40.122 --> 21:42.577
That's what I look for
in a chief executive.

21:42.612 --> 21:44.616
- Can you I. D. This guy?
- I'm not sure.

21:44.651 --> 21:47.584
He was wearing a ski mask.

21:47.619 --> 21:51.616
- Well, you were right about Henry Smalls.
- Except, I honestly thought

21:51.651 --> 21:54.578
he might be a suspect,
not the next victim.

21:54.613 --> 21:57.838
Yeah, but it is something.
It's something real.

21:57.873 --> 22:00.991
We've got our foot in the door.
Thank you.

22:04.253 --> 22:07.717
Oh, Monk, what the hell
is going on here?

22:09.249 --> 22:11.468
Okay.

22:11.503 --> 22:19.284
A Hispanic plumber, a retired white cop,
an African-American school teacher...

22:19.319 --> 22:22.412
- what do they have in common?
- Absolutely nothing.

22:22.447 --> 22:27.528
Exactly. They have nothing in common.
Different ages, occupations,

22:27.563 --> 22:33.953
some were rich, some poor.
Captain, this is a very diverse group.

22:33.988 --> 22:35.695
They are...

22:35.730 --> 22:37.666
- too diverse.
- Too diverse?

22:37.701 --> 22:41.433
I'm talking statistics.
You'd have to work hard,

22:41.468 --> 22:47.439
really hard, to find a group this
different. Plus, look at this.

22:48.241 --> 22:51.443
The blue pins indicate
where they lived, right? - Yep.

22:51.478 --> 22:54.346
The murders took place
all throughout the Bay Area,

22:54.381 --> 22:57.570
but the victims all lived
in Marin County.

22:57.605 --> 23:01.095
- What are the odds of that?
- Go on. Go, go, go, go, go.

23:01.130 --> 23:05.923
A diverse group,
all registered to vote.

23:07.230 --> 23:10.330
You know where you find
a group like that?

23:10.365 --> 23:12.012
Yes, yes. On a jury.!

23:12.047 --> 23:14.476
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Hang on. Hang on.

23:16.716 --> 23:21.293
He's right. They all served
on the same jury six years ago.

23:21.328 --> 23:24.314
- A jury.
- On a jury!

23:29.424 --> 23:32.140
Eleven victims.
What did they have in common?

23:32.175 --> 23:34.094
They all served together
on the same jury

23:34.129 --> 23:37.881
six years ago in Marin County.
It was a personal injury lawsuit.

23:37.916 --> 23:41.267
A handyman named Ian Agnew...
fell off of a roof and he landed on

23:41.302 --> 23:42.956
a metal pipe,
which was sticking up

23:42.991 --> 23:45.733
out of the ground.
Now, he sued the homeowners,

23:45.768 --> 23:48.677
a Stewart and Lisa Babcock,
for negligence.

23:48.712 --> 23:51.639
Apparently, part of the pipe
is still in the guy's head.

23:51.674 --> 23:54.989
- He has a pipe in his head?
- Yep. He's got a three-quarter inch...

23:55.024 --> 23:58.036
galvanized metal pipe in his head.
They couldn't remove all of it.

23:58.071 --> 24:02.369
- He has a pipe in his head?
- He was awarded $700,000.

24:02.404 --> 24:04.916
The homeowners' insurance
paid for the whole thing.

24:04.951 --> 24:07.368
It was a routine trial.

24:07.403 --> 24:12.478
Except, six years later, the jury's
being killed off one at a time.

24:12.513 --> 24:15.973
Excuse me, Captain.
What happened to the 12th juror?

24:16.008 --> 24:19.680
That's a good question, Kenny.
You know, I could use a guy

24:19.715 --> 24:23.382
like you on the force.
The 12th and only surviving juror

24:23.417 --> 24:26.204
is a fellow named Cassidy.
Wallace J. Cassidy.

24:26.239 --> 24:28.236
- We're looking for him right now.
- Did anything unusual

24:28.271 --> 24:30.886
- happen during the trial?
- Well, not according to this.

24:30.921 --> 24:35.213
They deliberated for a day and a half.
They went and visited the scene

24:35.248 --> 24:37.265
of the accident.
Then they were sequestered

24:37.300 --> 24:40.659
at a motel for a night,
and they delivered their verdict.

24:40.694 --> 24:44.237
- It's all very straightforward.
- Captain! You ready for this?

24:47.553 --> 24:50.075
Randy, you could be halfway
through your first sentence now.

24:50.110 --> 24:52.066
We just picked up
Juror Number 12

24:52.101 --> 24:55.460
at a casino in Wallenpaupack.
He gambles a lot.

24:55.495 --> 24:58.660
He's always in debt.
He did it.

24:58.695 --> 25:00.908
- What? He confessed?
- No, he lawyered up.

25:00.943 --> 25:03.229
- He's not saying a thing.
- But you think he's the guy?

25:03.264 --> 25:06.013
He tried to bolt when we picked him up.
The guy put up a hell of a fight.

25:06.048 --> 25:08.461
And... Are you ready for this?

25:10.030 --> 25:12.348
Yes, Randy, we're ready!
You don't have to ask.

25:12.383 --> 25:14.949
- You never have to ask.
- We just came from his house.

25:14.984 --> 25:17.995
There was a body part in the freezer.
A human finger.

25:18.030 --> 25:19.874
Really?

25:19.909 --> 25:23.208
Oh, the D. A.'s gonna love that.
They love body parts in the freezer.

25:23.243 --> 25:26.330
But none of the victims
were missing a finger.

25:26.365 --> 25:28.686
Yeah, well, uh,
he killed somebody else.

25:28.721 --> 25:31.033
I mean, that's why
they call them "psychotic."

25:31.068 --> 25:36.319
Why would he wait six years,
and then kill everybody else on the jury?

25:36.354 --> 25:39.524
I don't know and I don't care.
Congratulations, Captain.

25:39.559 --> 25:41.464
I'll be sure to mention you
in my statement.

25:41.499 --> 25:43.085
Whoa, whoa. Hey,
hang on. Kenny,

25:43.120 --> 25:46.340
uh, I think I should go with you.
They're gonna have a lot of questions

25:46.375 --> 25:48.645
and, uh, I know this case inside and out.

25:48.646 --> 25:51.358
Oh, all right. I'll,
uh... I'll say a few words

25:51.393 --> 25:53.694
- and then I'll introduce you, okay?
- Good deal.

25:53.729 --> 25:55.735
- Oh, uh, Kenny?
- Yeah, babe?

25:55.770 --> 25:58.038
Wait.

25:58.073 --> 26:00.710
Crooked. - Thank you, honey.

26:00.745 --> 26:05.468
Captain!

26:05.503 --> 26:06.435
Thank you, honey.

26:06.470 --> 26:07.573
Shall we? - Yeah.

26:07.608 --> 26:09.873
Wait! Cap... Captain?

26:09.908 --> 26:15.180
Why don't we slow down here?
I mean, what if I can I. D. This guy?

26:15.215 --> 26:20.075
I'd like to give it a try.
You want to be sure about this, right?

26:23.557 --> 26:28.904
Number 5, could you slide
a little to your right.

26:31.730 --> 26:35.555
A little more.

26:35.590 --> 26:37.019
Thank you.

26:40.153 --> 26:41.907
Number 1,

26:43.530 --> 26:48.061
you have some lint
on your jumpsuit.

26:48.096 --> 26:52.366
Number 2,
could you help number one?

26:52.401 --> 26:57.156
Adrian. Do you see
the guy from last night?

27:00.700 --> 27:05.113
Number 3, could you
trade places with Number 2?

27:05.148 --> 27:08.681
Number 3, stay where you are.
Monk, do you see the guy or not?

27:08.716 --> 27:12.965
Listen to me.
This is very important for you.

27:13.000 --> 27:17.529
It's very important for everybody.
So, for the record,

27:17.564 --> 27:23.010
before you say anything,
please count to the number four.

27:26.760 --> 27:33.111
Number 4,
could you step forward?

27:36.756 --> 27:39.881
Could you straighten that number?

27:41.176 --> 27:43.257
- He's not the guy.
- He's not the guy?

27:43.292 --> 27:45.775
- His fingernails are too long.
- His fingernails?

27:45.810 --> 27:47.992
The guy I fought last night
didn't have any fingernails.

27:48.027 --> 27:50.954
- I think he chewed them.
- Monk, this guy is the only

27:50.989 --> 27:53.917
- surviving member from that jury.
- Oh, we found a finger in his icebox.

27:53.952 --> 27:58.913
He's not the guy.
I want to know more about that trial.

27:58.948 --> 28:01.935
I think I should talk to the handyman
who fell off the roof.

28:01.970 --> 28:06.484
Captain, the press is all over this thing.
We can't keep a lid on it.

28:09.016 --> 28:11.239
All right, Monk, look.
You go... You go and you talk

28:11.274 --> 28:13.371
to the handyman, okay?
But you make it quick because

28:13.406 --> 28:17.131
I have got to go
public tonight. Go.

28:21.881 --> 28:24.762
- Thank you for seeing us.
- Oh, I don't mind.

28:24.797 --> 28:27.830
I don't get many visitors.
So, what can I do for you?

28:27.865 --> 28:31.520
Mr. Agnew, we were
wondering about your accident.

28:31.555 --> 28:34.871
Please, sit down.

28:40.483 --> 28:42.184
Uh,

28:42.219 --> 28:45.782
Ian, I used to be a nurse.
Is there anything I can do?

28:45.817 --> 28:50.095
No, thank you.
It comes and goes.

28:50.130 --> 28:54.247
It's the pipe.
I have a piece of pipe in my head.

28:54.282 --> 28:56.485
Oh. - I don't get many visitors.

28:56.520 --> 28:59.381
Please, sit...
sit, sit, sit, sit, sit,

28:59.416 --> 29:06.315
- sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.
- Sir? Uh, about your accident?

29:06.350 --> 29:10.193
Oh, the accident. I really
don't remember much about it.

29:10.228 --> 29:15.134
I, uh... We were building a cabana
near the pool for the Babcocks,

29:15.169 --> 29:20.237
and, uh, I was working on the roof.
And there was a... a tile loose.

29:20.272 --> 29:24.835
And the next thing I knew,
I woke up and I was a human smokestack.

29:24.870 --> 29:28.659
I'll get it! Hello? Hello?
It's a wrong number.

29:28.694 --> 29:30.541
I get 'em all the time.
How's that coffee?

29:30.576 --> 29:34.201
Bad dog.!
Anyway, I, uh...

29:34.236 --> 29:37.676
I haven't worked since. - Huh.

29:39.304 --> 29:43.335
- How did you get the job?
- Mrs. Babcock hired me,

29:43.370 --> 29:47.014
although by the time I had started,
she wasn't there anymore.

29:47.049 --> 29:50.287
They split up. She ran off.
I never got the whole story.

29:50.322 --> 29:52.288
I dealt mostly with,
uh, her husband, Stew.

29:52.323 --> 29:54.480
I'll get it!

29:56.631 --> 29:58.348
You know, I just
changed my phone number

29:58.383 --> 30:03.346
and it doesn't seem to help.
I don't get many visitors.

30:03.381 --> 30:06.052
-Did you go to the trial?
- I testified.

30:06.087 --> 30:10.252
- Did you spend any time with the jury?
- No, ma'am. I wish I had. Uh...

30:10.287 --> 30:12.933
I wanted to thank them.
They were very generous.

30:12.968 --> 30:17.945
I don't get many visitors.
¢Ü Tell me your answer true ¢Ü¢Ü

30:17.980 --> 30:19.525
Bad dog!

30:21.788 --> 30:28.798
You know what I think I miss the most?
Not having this pipe in my head.

30:28.833 --> 30:32.045
I have to take this.
Hello? Hello?

30:32.080 --> 30:34.287
I can't believe you're not
the craziest man in the room.

30:34.322 --> 30:38.016
- How did you get this number?
- We'll... let ourselves out.

30:38.051 --> 30:41.596
- You tell me who this is right now.!
- Go. Go. Go, go, go.

30:41.631 --> 30:43.303
I don't believe that for a minute.

30:44.179 --> 30:47.773
Ah, that was before my time.
I didn't even meet Stewart

30:47.808 --> 30:50.820
until after the trial.
Would you like some lemonade?

30:50.855 --> 30:53.171
Um... - No, thank you.

30:53.206 --> 30:57.905
Stew, these people want
to talk about the handyman.

30:57.940 --> 31:01.586
- What handyman?
- The one who sued you.

31:01.621 --> 31:06.117
- Why? That's ancient history.
- Is that where he fell?

31:06.152 --> 31:09.588
- Uh, yes, it was.
- Mr. Babcock, were you at home

31:09.623 --> 31:14.413
- when the accident occurred?
- No, I was on vacation with my wife.

31:14.448 --> 31:19.839
- My first wife. The Dragon Lady.
- Did you attend the trial?

31:19.874 --> 31:23.251
Well, there was no reason to.
It was my insurance company's headache.

31:23.286 --> 31:26.072
What is this all about?
I mean, that was settled,

31:26.107 --> 31:29.030
- like, six years ago.
- It's, uh...

31:29.065 --> 31:34.157
- It's probably nothing.
- Will you stop it? Please?

31:34.192 --> 31:38.337
Well, there's another...
another case involving

31:38.372 --> 31:41.266
- a few of the jurors.
- The jurors?

31:41.301 --> 31:44.580
Uh, yeah.
Did any of them try to contact you?

31:44.615 --> 31:48.129
The jurors? No.
Why would they?

31:51.968 --> 31:54.882
- Thank you.
- Do you have a trash can?

31:54.917 --> 31:59.915
- Just toss it anywhere.
- It's... wet.

31:59.950 --> 32:01.970
- It's a leaf.
- Why don't you just

32:02.005 --> 32:07.033
- throw it on the ground?
- I'll throw it out.

32:07.068 --> 32:12.023
- You'll thank me later.
- Uh, around the corner in the kitchen.

32:13.445 --> 32:16.068
Thank you.

32:20.790 --> 32:23.872
I had so much fun the other night.
Did you? Yeah.

32:23.907 --> 32:26.993
We have to do it again.
I know.

32:27.028 --> 32:29.996
Oh, you're so bad.
Uh, hold on. Hold on.

32:30.031 --> 32:32.447
Uh, Kenny wants to know
how we're doing.

32:32.482 --> 32:36.708
Tell him I don't know yet.
The jury's still out, so to speak.

32:36.743 --> 32:39.728
Uh, Kenny, you know what?
He-He's a little distracted right now.

32:39.763 --> 32:43.765
Why don't I call you back later?

32:43.800 --> 32:48.329
Okay. Y-You did?
Oh, my God. Thank you.

32:48.364 --> 32:53.635
You're an angel. An angel.
All right, I'll speak to you later. Bye.

32:53.670 --> 32:56.023
Adrian, do you know what
Kenny just did?

32:56.058 --> 32:59.150
He took care of all
of my parking tickets.

32:59.185 --> 33:04.488
He's like Superman.
That's strange. - What?

33:04.523 --> 33:07.476
Lisa Babcock said
she didn't meet her husband

33:07.511 --> 33:12.943
till after the trial. But look.

33:12.978 --> 33:16.238
This picture was taken
more than six years ago.

33:16.273 --> 33:19.441
- How do you know?
- I recognize that restaurant.

33:19.476 --> 33:22.541
It's O'Malleys on Richmond.
They haven't allowed smoking

33:22.576 --> 33:30.208
in there since 1995.
And... And he was chewing his nails.

33:30.243 --> 33:32.715
- Who, Babcock?
- Just now.

33:32.750 --> 33:37.576
- In the pool.
- So what does it mean?

33:37.611 --> 33:43.771
- It means they're a couple of liars.
- Or maybe worse.

33:43.806 --> 33:46.896
Maybe a lot worse.

33:53.826 --> 33:56.517
Kenny, come here.
Kenny, come here!

33:56.552 --> 33:58.593
What the hell are you doing?
I didn't authorize this.

33:58.628 --> 34:02.095
I did. Captain, the people
of San Francisco are frightened.

34:02.130 --> 34:04.550
They deserve to know that
we have a suspect in custody.

34:04.585 --> 34:08.928
This is not a campaign stop, Kenny.
Monk could not I. D. The guy.

34:08.963 --> 34:12.136
Monk could not I. D.
The guy's fingernails, Captain.

34:12.170 --> 34:14.862
That's just not good enough.
Now, I want to reassure the citizens...

34:14.898 --> 34:17.478
that we have made a significant
breakthrough in this case.

34:17.514 --> 34:20.214
- But we haven't made...
- Captain.!

34:20.248 --> 34:23.062
We just found this photograph
in Wallace Cassidy's house.

34:23.097 --> 34:25.404
- Oh. Who's this?
- I don't know, but, uh,

34:25.438 --> 34:27.549
- she's definitely a woman.
- She looks like she's frozen.

34:27.583 --> 34:31.569
Yeah, Captain, this picture,
plus the finger in the freezer,

34:31.603 --> 34:33.672
plus he tried to run,
plus he is the only surviving

34:33.708 --> 34:37.101
- member on that jury.
- What else do you need?

34:39.514 --> 34:42.331
Okay.

34:42.367 --> 34:45.891
- Okay, go ahead.
- Good afternoon. In a few minutes,

34:45.926 --> 34:47.905
Deputy Mayor Kenny Shale...
will be making his brief

34:47.940 --> 34:50.690
statement regarding
the recent series of homicides in...

34:50.725 --> 34:53.741
Monk, you're too late. They're
about to name Wallace Cassidy

34:53.775 --> 34:56.565
- as the primary suspect.
- Oh! No. No, they're making a mistake.

34:56.600 --> 34:58.942
Lieutenant, there is
something else going on here.

34:58.977 --> 35:03.127
Stewart and Lisa Babcock
are involved in all of this. I know it.

35:03.162 --> 35:05.502
The homeowners where the guy
fell off the roof. How?

35:05.537 --> 35:07.650
- We're still working on it.
- Well, can you prove it?

35:07.685 --> 35:10.678
- Not yet.
- What... Wh-What's this?

35:10.713 --> 35:14.035
The coroner found it.
It's a sleeve or part of it.

35:14.070 --> 35:17.287
Henry Smalls, Juror Number 12...
he was clutching it when he died.

35:17.322 --> 35:23.356
He must have ripped it off the killer.
Monk, forget it. It's a dead end.

35:23.391 --> 35:25.304
It's already gone through the lab.
It's untraceable.

35:25.339 --> 35:28.889
...time for a "Q" and "A" later,
but remember, officially,

35:28.924 --> 35:31.540
this is still an open case,
so we're not going to be able to get...

35:31.575 --> 35:35.216
Captain! Captain!

35:35.251 --> 35:37.337
What have you got?
What's up?

35:37.372 --> 35:40.980
L... I think I know
what's been going on here.

35:41.015 --> 35:45.251
It wasn't Juror Number 12.
It was Stewart and Lisa Babcock.

35:45.286 --> 35:48.180
What? The couple that's
being sued? Are you sure?

35:48.215 --> 35:50.922
- Do you mean, am I certain?
- Yes. Yes. That's what

35:50.957 --> 35:54.166
- I mean by, "Are you sure?"
- Not yet. L...

35:54.201 --> 35:58.015
I need an hour. Just one hour
and then we'll know.

35:58.050 --> 36:01.409
- Is there a problem?
- Captain? Are we about ready?

36:01.444 --> 36:05.500
Hang on just a second.
Kenny, Monk needs an hour.

36:05.535 --> 36:07.786
- I'm gonna give it to him.
- What about the press?

36:07.821 --> 36:09.697
The press can wait.
That's what they get paid for.

36:09.732 --> 36:12.500
I can't. If we don't start now,
we're not going to make

36:12.535 --> 36:14.734
the 6:00 news, all right?
I'm going to go ahead

36:14.769 --> 36:17.660
with or without you, Captain.
It's called "leadership."

36:17.695 --> 36:22.093
No. No, Kenny,
it's called grandstanding.

36:22.128 --> 36:25.131
- Let's go.
- Kenny! Kenny! Kenny!

36:25.166 --> 36:28.437
Oh, hey, sweetie, I'm glad you stayed.
Watch this. A star is born.

36:28.472 --> 36:30.714
No, no, wait.
Kenny, Kenny. Listen to me.

36:30.749 --> 36:33.399
You're making a big mistake.
This is the kind of mistake that...

36:33.434 --> 36:36.250
- that people won't forget.
- Well, Sharona, sweetheart, you don't

36:36.285 --> 36:40.307
- understand how this game is played.
- But you said you trusted me.

36:40.342 --> 36:46.910
Well, I trusted you to pick out my
tie, babe. Not with the big stuff.

36:46.945 --> 36:49.826
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you very much for coming.

36:49.861 --> 36:51.689
I'd like you to know
we've made a significant

36:51.724 --> 36:52.155
breakthrough in this case.

36:58.504 --> 37:02.357
Mr. And Mrs. Babcock?
San Francisco P. D.

37:02.392 --> 37:06.687
I'm Captain Stottlemeyer.
Were you folks going somewhere?

37:06.722 --> 37:10.307
- We're just getting away for the weekend.
- Yes, we have a house at the beach.

37:10.342 --> 37:12.571
- Well, I'm glad we caught you.
- "I trust you with my ties."

37:12.606 --> 37:15.229
Where the hell does he get off?
Where the hell...

37:15.264 --> 37:18.920
I don't know. Are those passports
in your handbag, Mrs. Babcock?

37:18.955 --> 37:21.069
You're not leaving
for the weekend, are you?

37:21.104 --> 37:23.839
You're leaving for good...
because you heard they

37:23.874 --> 37:26.654
- just arrested Wallace Cassidy.
- Who?

37:26.689 --> 37:29.560
Fixes a few parking tickets and you
think he can talk to me that way?

37:29.595 --> 37:33.432
- Nobody talks to me that way. Nobody!
- Wallace Cassidy.

37:33.467 --> 37:35.886
He was on the jury when
you were being sued six years ago.

37:35.921 --> 37:38.828
What are you talking about?
Why would we care about

37:38.863 --> 37:41.342
- somebody on a jury? That...
- Maybe because you knew

37:41.377 --> 37:47.129
he was going to confess.
Not for murder, for blackmail.

37:47.164 --> 37:50.286
Juror Number 12
was blackmailing you.

37:50.321 --> 37:52.023
He knew that you
had murdered your first wife.

37:53.587 --> 37:56.751
After Ian Agnew
fell off your roof six years ago

37:56.786 --> 38:00.491
and sued you for negligence,
the jury was brought here

38:00.526 --> 38:04.279
to visit the scene of the accident.

38:04.314 --> 38:08.434
One of them,
Wallace Cassidy, wandered off.

38:08.469 --> 38:10.532
Most likely, he was looking
for something to steal.

38:10.567 --> 38:13.235
Mr. Cassidy
had a gambling problem.

38:13.270 --> 38:16.227
- He was always in debt.
- I can't believe

38:16.262 --> 38:18.387
I went out with him.
He's not even my type.

38:18.422 --> 38:20.588
I felt sorry for that
stupid weasel.

38:20.623 --> 38:22.925
Sharona? - What!

38:22.960 --> 38:26.582
We're working here.

38:26.617 --> 38:29.492
Mr. Cassidy never did find
anything to steal.

38:29.527 --> 38:33.169
He found something
a lot more valuable.

38:33.204 --> 38:35.726
It was the first Mrs. Babcock.
He didn't leave without

38:35.761 --> 38:41.905
taking a picture...
and one ofher fingers.

38:41.940 --> 38:44.884
We have that picture,
and we have the finger.

38:44.919 --> 38:48.007
It won't be hard to prove
who it belongs to.

38:48.042 --> 38:50.975
He sent you an anonymous note
demanding money.

38:51.010 --> 38:52.319
You knew it was from
one of the jurors,

38:52.354 --> 38:55.634
but you didn't know which one.
At the time you didn't really care.

38:56.596 --> 38:59.974
Cassidy was small-time,
and he wasn't asking for much.

39:00.009 --> 39:05.537
So you paid him and you thought
that was the end of it.

39:05.572 --> 39:09.231
But it didn't end there.
Cassidy kept coming back for more.

39:09.266 --> 39:12.683
So you decided to kill the blackmailer.
But since you didn't know

39:12.718 --> 39:18.522
which of the 12 jurors it was,
they all had to go, one at a time.

39:18.557 --> 39:20.816
Bastard!

39:22.732 --> 39:27.613
- Not you.
- Sharona, murderers, okay?

39:27.648 --> 39:30.287
Relax, honey.
They can't prove a thing.

39:30.322 --> 39:31.660
If they could,
they would have arrested us

39:31.695 --> 39:36.235
as soon as they got here. - That's
true. I couldn't prove a thing until...

39:36.270 --> 39:39.745
I found this.

39:39.780 --> 39:42.624
Your shirtsleeve was torn off
when you attacked

39:42.659 --> 39:46.258
- Juror Number 11.
- Can you prove that's my shirt?

39:46.293 --> 39:50.762
No, sir, I can't.
But I know someone who can.

39:50.797 --> 39:55.114
As soon as I saw this,
I had the strange feeling

39:55.149 --> 39:58.850
that the killer and I might have
something in common.

39:58.885 --> 40:03.461
- We both use the same dry cleaner.
- Mr. Monk, why you bring me here?

40:03.496 --> 40:05.383
I got to close my shop.
I'm losing money.

40:05.418 --> 40:10.320
- You're just my worst customer.
- The longest car ride of my life.

40:10.355 --> 40:13.039
I'm sorry, Mrs. Ling,
but this is very important.

40:13.074 --> 40:17.527
- Do you recognize this?
- Yeah. Yeah, I know this shirt.

40:17.562 --> 40:20.139
I clean this shirt.
Silk. Beautiful shirt.

40:20.174 --> 40:23.430
Hanger, no starch.
What you do to this shirt?

40:23.465 --> 40:26.626
Mrs. Ling, there must be a thousand
shirts like this in the world.

40:26.661 --> 40:29.274
How do you know
you cleaned this particular one?

40:29.309 --> 40:31.693
You know how.
The button, it fall off.

40:31.728 --> 40:34.064
- I sewed it back on.
- The thread is parallel,

40:34.099 --> 40:37.346
not crisscrossed.
No one else sews a button on like this.

40:37.381 --> 40:41.022
I told you, Mr. Monk.
That's my style!

40:41.057 --> 40:44.303
Always complaining about the button.
Hey, Mr. Babcock!

40:44.338 --> 40:47.720
When I fixed this shirt for you,
you don't complain, right,

40:47.755 --> 40:51.931
'cause you're a good customer. - Mrs.
Ling, are you certain that this shirt

40:51.966 --> 40:54.450
- belongs to Mr. Babcock?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

40:54.485 --> 40:57.923
He's a good customer.
You come back anytime, Mr. Babcock.

40:57.958 --> 41:00.850
- Ma'am, he just killed 11 people.
- Twelve.

41:00.885 --> 41:03.038
Let's not forget about
the first Mrs. Babcock,

41:03.073 --> 41:06.125
who I'll bet is buried
under that new porch.

41:07.208 --> 41:13.487
Well, he's still a good customer.
Not crazy like that Mr. Monk over there.

41:13.522 --> 41:15.848
Mr. And Mrs. Babcock,
could you step back inside, please?

41:15.883 --> 41:18.861
We'd like to ask you
a few more questions.

41:18.896 --> 41:20.579
- Right this way.
- This way, please.

41:20.614 --> 41:24.620
- Thank you, Mrs. Ling.
- Yeah, yeah, all right.

41:24.655 --> 41:28.429
Hey, saw your boyfriend
on TV last night.

41:28.464 --> 41:32.564
Kenny Shale. He's a good man.
I like him.

41:32.599 --> 41:39.297
- Yeah? Well, I like Mr. Monk better.
- Oh! Mr. Monk's a crazy man.

41:39.332 --> 41:41.704
Well, I like him better. - No.

41:41.739 --> 41:44.697
I do. - Stop saying that.

41:48.563 --> 41:52.053
Go away, Mr. Monk! No!
No more Mr. Monk!

41:52.088 --> 41:55.744
- No, no, no. Go! You! Go away!
- Oh, forget it.

41:55.779 --> 41:58.365
We'll find another cleaners.
You know...

42:00.178 --> 42:04.796
Hey! Hey, hey!
What are you doing?

42:04.831 --> 42:09.261
- The meter ran out.
- I thought you fed the meter?

42:09.296 --> 42:13.783
I was carrying this.

42:13.818 --> 42:16.742
Hey, hey.
Do you know Kenny Shale?

42:16.777 --> 42:20.748
- He's a good friend of mine.
- You mean the former deputy mayor?

42:20.783 --> 42:22.616
Former? - Yeah.

42:22.651 --> 42:25.821
Your good friend
resigned this morning.

42:25.856 --> 42:30.269
It was on the news.
Have a nice day.

42:30.304 --> 42:34.552
- Well, I guess the party's over.
- I don't miss him.

42:34.587 --> 42:37.685
I miss the attention,
but not him. Here.

42:37.720 --> 42:39.812
- What's this?
- I'm not paying for it.

42:39.847 --> 42:42.666
- It's your car!
- You didn't put money in the meter.

42:42.701 --> 42:48.859
Okay, let's compromise.
You pay the ticket, and I... don't.

42:48.894 --> 42:53.793
- What kind of compromise is that?
- Well, that's the economical kind.
