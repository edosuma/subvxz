00:06.056 --> 00:09.424
Hello. And a big Binford welcome
back to Binford's <i>Tool Time.</i>

00:09.526 --> 00:11.598
You may have noticed a little change
in the set here.

00:11.628 --> 00:14.928
Well, Binford has to put its name
on practically everything.

00:17.868 --> 00:20.929
Well, today we're going to show you
how the experts work

00:21.004 --> 00:23.473
with the world's hardest stone,
a diamond.

00:23.540 --> 00:26.046
That's right. In case you just joined us,
all the way from South Africa,

00:26.076 --> 00:28.102
we have a guest,
expert diamond-cutter...

00:28.178 --> 00:30.010
- Hi. Hi.
- Dirk Brodsky.

00:30.080 --> 00:32.345
Dirk comes from a long line
of diamond-cutters.

00:32.415 --> 00:34.078
Oh, yeah. That's right. In fact,

00:34.151 --> 00:37.315
I've brought some diamonds cut
by my great-grandfather.

00:37.587 --> 00:40.079
We're looking forward to seeing
your family jewels.

00:42.325 --> 00:45.625
Humor is such a tricky thing, isn't it?

00:48.331 --> 00:50.800
All right, well, why don't we show you

00:50.867 --> 00:53.996
how diamonds are honed
using these machines?

00:54.071 --> 00:56.209
All right. We'll start off
with this little saw. What is this for?

00:56.239 --> 00:58.265
This is a rotary diamond saw.

00:58.341 --> 01:01.505
We cut away the unusable part
of our rough diamond

01:01.578 --> 01:04.206
and it gives us perfect cleavage.

01:06.883 --> 01:10.342
And we all know how important
perfect cleavage is.

01:10.420 --> 01:11.854
Very tricky.

01:13.356 --> 01:15.416
Over here,
this is the brooding machine.

01:15.492 --> 01:18.519
Brooding. Does it come
with a self-pity attachment?

01:20.130 --> 01:21.655
No.

01:21.731 --> 01:25.168
Now, with this machine we shape
the outermost edge of the diamond

01:25.235 --> 01:29.297
which is known as the girdle.
Now, it's critical to keep your diamond

01:29.372 --> 01:33.332
at a correct angle
in order to avoid girdle stress.

01:33.410 --> 01:36.312
Something Al's mom knows a lot about.

01:37.647 --> 01:41.516
Persistence. Now, over here,
this is the polisher.

01:42.352 --> 01:45.322
Lou here is shaping and polishing
the facets of the diamond

01:45.388 --> 01:46.856
using this spinning wheel.

01:46.923 --> 01:49.483
All right. How long
does the whole process take?

01:49.559 --> 01:52.119
With jokes like yours,
it could take years.

01:53.363 --> 01:56.265
But usually about three days.

01:56.333 --> 01:58.495
Lou? Thanks very much.
Once he's dipped it

01:58.602 --> 02:02.972
in the hydrochloric-acid bath,
it'll end up looking something like this.

02:03.073 --> 02:08.410
A beautiful stone, perfectly flawless
and needless to say, priceless.

02:08.612 --> 02:10.532
- Let's take a look at that thing.
- Yes, well...

02:11.214 --> 02:12.319
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- Yeah.

02:12.349 --> 02:14.888
Look at that, folks. It's got a little
burr on there. Why don't I just...

02:14.918 --> 02:16.022
- What?
- take that right off the side?

02:16.052 --> 02:17.179
No!

02:19.000 --> 02:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:28.098 --> 02:29.657
Lovely setting.

02:32.802 --> 02:33.895
Thank you.

03:25.255 --> 03:28.987
- Hi, sexy. Great show.
- Thank you.

03:30.727 --> 03:34.027
Hi! Are we still on for hibachi night
at your place?

03:34.097 --> 03:37.761
You betcha! I picked up the hamburger
meat. You just bring the buns.

03:40.136 --> 03:41.832
Come on. Let me walk you to your car.

03:41.905 --> 03:43.066
- Okay.
- See you, guys.

03:43.139 --> 03:46.109
- Bye.
- Good afternoon, Tim.

03:46.209 --> 03:47.541
Bud, we're gonna have to talk

03:47.611 --> 03:49.382
about these changes
you're making on the show.

03:49.412 --> 03:54.146
Hey, Tool Man! Beautiful show.
Loving it. Loving you.

03:54.551 --> 03:56.782
Well, why don't you love me
from over there?

03:56.853 --> 03:59.413
And tell me who the hell you are.

03:59.489 --> 04:03.187
Tim, this is the man I've chosen
to supervise <i>Tool Time,</i>

04:03.827 --> 04:06.797
Binford's new VP of Media Production,
Morgan Wandell.

04:07.764 --> 04:11.132
And you don't have to call me
Mr. Wandell. You call me Morgan.

04:11.234 --> 04:13.965
Or I may go with something else.

04:14.037 --> 04:18.132
Well, I have an extensive background
in entertainment and reality television.

04:18.208 --> 04:20.700
I'm particularly proud
of my last special.

04:20.777 --> 04:23.337
<i>Topless Cops on Ice. Oh, that was...</i>

04:23.446 --> 04:25.151
And we feel that the stuff you do
on <i>Tool Time</i>

04:25.181 --> 04:26.319
could be in that same league.

04:26.349 --> 04:27.373
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

04:27.450 --> 04:31.353
See, Morgan feels all your show needs
is explosion consistency.

04:32.722 --> 04:34.361
- What?
- He wants you to blow up more stuff.

04:34.391 --> 04:36.417
Right.

04:36.493 --> 04:39.622
Whether it's an accident or not.

04:40.063 --> 04:44.330
No, no. No. I'm not gonna stage
explosions on <i>Tool Time.</i>

04:44.401 --> 04:47.166
I'm proud of the fact all the accidents
on this show

04:47.237 --> 04:50.366
are a result
of my legitimately stupid mistakes.

04:52.509 --> 04:55.570
- What are you working on?
- Oh, it's just an application

04:55.679 --> 04:57.511
for a counseling job in Dearborn.

04:57.580 --> 05:00.550
I might go for the PhD.
But I want to keep my options open.

05:00.650 --> 05:02.722
Yeah, that's a good idea.
I mean, the last thing you want to do

05:02.752 --> 05:05.722
is narrow yourself down
in your golden years.

05:07.057 --> 05:09.583
I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that.

05:09.659 --> 05:12.390
And yet very soon
you won't have to pretend.

05:15.131 --> 05:16.463
- Hi, guys.
- What's up, Dad?

05:16.533 --> 05:17.557
Hi.

05:17.634 --> 05:20.399
- Horrible day today.
- Really? What happened?

05:20.503 --> 05:25.271
Get this. Bud's handed <i>Tool Time</i> over
to some hotshot young producer

05:25.375 --> 05:28.140
who wants me to stage explosions.

05:28.211 --> 05:32.478
- He wants more danger on <i>Tool Time.</i>
- More danger?

05:33.783 --> 05:37.311
You already have higher
insurance rates than the Knievel family.

05:39.489 --> 05:42.323
Morgan Wandell.
The guy's been on the set... What?

05:42.392 --> 05:46.557
One day. And everybody's miserable.
Everybody is miserable.

05:46.629 --> 05:50.589
Hey, guys! I am walking on sunshine!

05:58.908 --> 06:01.742
I guess he's crying on the inside.

06:01.811 --> 06:05.179
Crying? I am flying!
I have decided the time is right

06:05.248 --> 06:07.183
to ask Trudy for her hand in marriage.

06:07.250 --> 06:11.551
- Get out! Hey! Congratulations.
- Oh, my God! That's so great!

06:11.621 --> 06:12.782
Yeah.

06:12.889 --> 06:16.792
That's right. After I walked Trudy
to her car, I ran into Dirk.

06:16.860 --> 06:19.091
And he sold me one of his diamonds.

06:19.162 --> 06:20.186
Ooh!

06:20.263 --> 06:25.531
- Al, this is so beautiful.
- Yes, it is! I really love the cleavage.

06:27.370 --> 06:30.898
Oh. Well, thank you. But, gosh!
It's so pretty.

06:31.641 --> 06:34.975
Everything will become official after
this wonderful dinner I have arranged.

06:35.044 --> 06:36.068
Ooh.

06:36.146 --> 06:38.843
Oh, that's so romantic.
Trudy's going to love that.

06:38.915 --> 06:41.282
Actually, Trudy won't be there.

06:41.351 --> 06:45.049
I'm taking Mother out to dinner
to break the news to her first.

06:45.121 --> 06:46.145
Oh!

06:46.222 --> 06:48.919
- Well, that's a way to go.
- And let me guess

06:48.992 --> 06:51.352
where you're taking her.
Sven's All-You-Can-Eat Smorgasbord.

06:51.394 --> 06:53.488
No. As luck would have it...

06:53.563 --> 06:56.829
You know they went bankrupt
shortly after our last visit?

06:58.168 --> 07:01.605
You know, I do remember seeing
a white flag in their window, yeah.

07:01.671 --> 07:05.130
Yeah. So, I'm taking her to Sorrentino's,
Saturday night.

07:05.241 --> 07:06.413
We're gonna be there Saturday night.

07:06.443 --> 07:07.706
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:07.777 --> 07:10.150
Hey, I got it. After you tell your mom,
let me know. We'll come over

07:10.180 --> 07:12.385
and get a little bottle of champagne
and we'll celebrate with you.

07:12.415 --> 07:14.782
Oh, that would be great.
I could use the support.

07:14.851 --> 07:16.731
I'm very nervous
about how she's going to react.

07:16.786 --> 07:18.755
Oh, don't worry. It's gonna be fine.

07:18.822 --> 07:22.782
I hope so. I can't believe
I'm gonna pop the question!

07:22.859 --> 07:24.953
Ah, it's a big day in a man's life.
It really is.

07:25.028 --> 07:26.519
- It sure is.
- Yeah.

07:26.596 --> 07:27.934
Do you remember
when you asked your mother

07:27.964 --> 07:30.126
for permission to get married?

07:32.702 --> 07:35.604
I wonder if Al and his mom
are here yet.

07:42.412 --> 07:44.779
I'm guessing yes.

07:44.881 --> 07:46.713
Hey, Al. Hi, Alma.

07:50.453 --> 07:51.819
Good evening.

07:52.522 --> 07:55.651
Antonio. What are you doing here?
I thought you were working

07:55.725 --> 07:58.593
- at that French restaurant.
- I was traded for a chef

07:58.695 --> 08:00.789
and a waiter to be named later.

08:00.864 --> 08:03.424
- I am so happy to see you.
- Really?

08:03.533 --> 08:08.904
No. I'm practicing false sincerity so
the Borland party will give me a big tip.

08:10.340 --> 08:12.206
Well, we're gonna need
a few minutes here.

08:12.275 --> 08:15.837
- Just some bread and water to start.
- How tantalizing!

08:19.616 --> 08:23.053
My God! Is that Gwyneth Paltrow?

08:25.021 --> 08:28.583
No, Antonio! That's still my mother.

08:30.960 --> 08:32.724
I've never seen him so nervous.

08:32.828 --> 08:35.731
Not since we did our salute to propane.

08:38.333 --> 08:41.462
Ooh. I think he's gonna tell her now.
I see the ring coming out.

08:41.538 --> 08:45.703
Mother, I have some great news.
I've decided to make Trudy my bride.

08:50.513 --> 08:52.277
Oh, my God!

08:55.952 --> 08:58.183
Somebody call a paramedic!

09:11.100 --> 09:13.626
- I'm so sorry, Al.
- So am I.

09:16.439 --> 09:18.908
I can't believe I killed my mother!

09:21.177 --> 09:24.511
This was a terrible tragedy.
But you had nothing to do with it.

09:24.581 --> 09:27.676
Well, she died because she was
distraught over my getting married.

09:27.750 --> 09:29.844
- No!
- You don't know that.

09:30.320 --> 09:32.482
It could've been all the excitement
at dinner.

09:32.555 --> 09:35.992
Look, let's be honest. Your mother was
not in the best physical condition.

09:36.059 --> 09:38.927
The doctor said that she was
a prime candidate for a heart attack.

09:38.995 --> 09:40.964
- And I pushed her over the edge.
- No.

09:41.030 --> 09:43.503
You're being way too hard
on yourself, Al. This is not your fault.

09:43.533 --> 09:47.095
And think of it this way. Your mom went
the way she would want to go.

09:47.937 --> 09:50.168
She was dining in a fine restaurant.

09:53.343 --> 09:55.903
Surrounded by her favorite side dishes.

09:57.480 --> 10:00.382
And now she's at that big buffet
in the sky.

10:04.354 --> 10:06.619
I just can't believe she's gone.

10:08.091 --> 10:10.720
No more do-si-doing
at the seniors' center.

10:12.061 --> 10:15.122
No more harmonizing with Don Ho.

10:18.034 --> 10:19.593
Oh, honey.

10:19.702 --> 10:21.864
Come on, buddy.
You'll get through this.

10:21.971 --> 10:23.599
We'll be there for you, buddy.

10:23.673 --> 10:27.633
I'm so glad you decided
to stay with us tonight.

10:27.710 --> 10:30.179
Would you like me to make you
a nice cup of tea?

10:30.246 --> 10:31.737
- Yes, I would.
- Okay.

10:31.814 --> 10:34.978
- I can grill up some bratwurst.
- That would be nice.

10:36.753 --> 10:40.918
And about work, Al, you can take off
all the time you need. Okay, buddy?

10:41.024 --> 10:42.695
And if you need any help
with the arrangements,

10:42.725 --> 10:45.285
- we'll be glad to pitch in.
- Oh, thank you.

10:45.361 --> 10:47.853
Gosh, there are so many details!

10:47.930 --> 10:52.197
I have to notify the rest of the family.
I have to find a minister.

10:52.268 --> 10:55.568
Oh, gosh!
I have to buy Mother a burial plot.

10:55.638 --> 10:57.573
That could get pricey.

11:00.610 --> 11:02.738
Thanks for filling in for Al, Heidi.

11:02.812 --> 11:04.576
Oh, sure. Anything to help.

11:04.647 --> 11:07.620
But, you know, I'm a little nervous.
You and Al work so well off each other.

11:07.650 --> 11:09.312
Oh, come on.
You're gonna do just fine.

11:09.385 --> 11:10.990
Hey, tell you what.
Do you have any quirks

11:11.020 --> 11:14.286
or physical abnormalities I can
make fun of?

11:14.390 --> 11:15.390
Uh...

11:15.892 --> 11:19.056
Yeah. I twitch when I get nervous.

11:19.262 --> 11:21.629
- Your eye or something?
- Not exactly.

11:34.710 --> 11:37.475
I don't know if I can work with that.

11:38.748 --> 11:39.909
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.

11:39.982 --> 11:41.654
Al, I thought you were taking
some time off.

11:41.684 --> 11:42.755
Well, I thought it would be good

11:42.785 --> 11:44.811
to keep my mind busy with work
right now.

11:44.887 --> 11:48.346
That's a good idea.
God, this must be so hard for you!

11:49.792 --> 11:52.318
I've gotta get ready
for my new intro. Okay?

11:55.565 --> 11:56.794
- Hi, Trudy.
- Hi.

11:56.866 --> 11:58.027
What are you doing here?

11:58.134 --> 11:59.830
I just wanted to make sure
you were okay.

11:59.902 --> 12:03.134
I haven't seen or heard from you
since your mother died.

12:03.206 --> 12:05.141
Well, I've been taking care of business.

12:05.208 --> 12:08.542
- You know, a lot of things going on.
- I figured that.

12:08.611 --> 12:10.477
Lookit, I made you a shepherd's pie.

12:10.546 --> 12:13.243
Just the way you like it,
with double meat.

12:13.316 --> 12:14.682
Thanks.

12:14.784 --> 12:18.619
- I'll leave you guys alone.
- No, no. That's all right.

12:18.688 --> 12:21.248
We really gotta get ready for the show.

12:21.324 --> 12:23.987
Okay. I guess I'll see you soon.

12:24.060 --> 12:26.586
- Thanks.
- Bye, Trudy.

12:29.766 --> 12:32.031
It's pretty nice of her
to come down here and bake you

12:32.101 --> 12:34.161
a shepherd's pie with double meat.

12:35.204 --> 12:38.265
To be honest,
I just wish she'd kind of back off!

12:38.574 --> 12:41.544
What are you talking about? A couple
days ago you wanted to propose to her.

12:41.611 --> 12:45.241
- Well, that was two days ago.
- What's happened?

12:45.314 --> 12:47.874
Two days ago my whole life changed!

12:47.950 --> 12:49.919
Oh, come on, Al.
I know you feel like that now.

12:50.019 --> 12:53.512
But you and Trudy still love each other
and everything else is the same.

13:00.296 --> 13:04.063
Let's get ready to repair!

13:18.147 --> 13:20.582
Oh, my God!

13:22.385 --> 13:24.945
It looks like somebody
hand-polished a barn.

13:28.624 --> 13:33.085
Well, that's an example
of something that you shouldn't say.

13:33.162 --> 13:35.028
- I'm glad you cleared that up.
- Yeah.

13:35.097 --> 13:38.534
Guys, take a seat.
Let's go pay our respects to Al.

13:40.136 --> 13:42.901
Wow! Heidi seems really upset.

13:43.840 --> 13:46.002
I think I should go comfort her.

13:47.476 --> 13:51.140
Oh, thank you, guys, for coming.
You remember my brother Cal.

13:51.213 --> 13:53.114
- Cal, sorry about your mom.
- Thank you.

13:53.182 --> 13:56.550
- Hi, Cal. How are you?
- I'm trying to be strong.

13:57.186 --> 14:02.750
Well, you don't have to be.
I mean, a funeral is for grieving.

14:03.526 --> 14:07.486
You're right.
I wish I was in the casket with her.

14:09.899 --> 14:12.562
You're a therapist, right?

14:12.635 --> 14:14.103
Hi, Al.

14:14.170 --> 14:16.139
Hi, Trudy.

14:17.673 --> 14:22.111
It's quite a turnout. Your mother
was obviously loved by a lot of people.

14:23.613 --> 14:28.108
Thanks. Boy, I really need to say hi
to Aunt Martha.

14:29.852 --> 14:32.219
I don't know what to do.
I want to support Al.

14:32.288 --> 14:34.780
But he keeps pushing me away.

14:36.092 --> 14:38.960
Well, maybe he just needs
some space.

14:39.028 --> 14:43.124
Maybe. I should go pay my respects.

14:46.902 --> 14:50.168
- What's going on?
- It's pretty obvious.

14:50.239 --> 14:52.265
Al associates Trudy
with his mom's death

14:52.341 --> 14:55.800
so he's pushing her away emotionally
and physically.

14:55.878 --> 14:56.878
Wow!

15:00.416 --> 15:03.784
- How'd you come up with that one?
- Al told me.

15:07.056 --> 15:08.581
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Benny.

15:08.658 --> 15:09.682
Oh, hey, Benny.

15:09.759 --> 15:11.853
- What a solemn occasion.
- I know.

15:11.928 --> 15:13.021
Jujube?

15:14.897 --> 15:17.765
Benny, don't you think
it's a little inappropriate

15:17.833 --> 15:20.962
to be passing out snacks at a funeral?

15:21.037 --> 15:24.474
You're right. I'm a bad boy.

15:28.044 --> 15:31.708
You know, honey, you are ruining
this funeral for everybody.

15:35.051 --> 15:37.213
I'm glad Al got you to officiate.

15:37.320 --> 15:39.687
Well, it's my honor
to do it, neighbor.

15:41.290 --> 15:45.455
Of course I haven't done a funeral
since my last ceremony in Pago Pago.

15:45.561 --> 15:46.688
Tim, if you'll excuse me,

15:46.762 --> 15:50.426
I have to make a few adjustments
on this service.

15:50.499 --> 15:54.368
Substitute "Heavenly Father"
for "Lizard King."

15:56.672 --> 16:01.133
I was just thinking about my mother,
all the great times we used to have.

16:01.510 --> 16:05.140
When I was a kid,
she used to take us to the park.

16:06.048 --> 16:10.281
We'd fly kites,
she'd push us on the swing.

16:10.353 --> 16:14.586
- We'd spend hours on the teeter-totter.
- I used to love the teeter-totter.

16:15.057 --> 16:17.959
Up and down. Up and down.

16:19.962 --> 16:20.962
Down?

16:28.137 --> 16:31.301
Well, they play it differently
in different parts of the country.

16:32.174 --> 16:35.838
I just can't believe she's gone.

16:36.779 --> 16:38.042
I'm so alone.

16:38.114 --> 16:41.448
You're not alone. You're not alone.
You got me, buddy.

16:41.550 --> 16:43.712
- I know.
- You got your friends, your family,

16:43.819 --> 16:46.755
you know?
And Trudy, who really, really loves you.

16:47.790 --> 16:50.316
And I really love her. But I...

16:51.694 --> 16:54.789
I don't think my mother
really wanted me to marry Trudy.

16:54.864 --> 16:56.093
Did she say that?

16:56.165 --> 16:59.260
No. But I think actions speak louder
than words!

17:00.770 --> 17:02.942
Al, I don't think that's what she meant.
You can't re-live...

17:02.972 --> 17:06.840
If everybody would take their
seats, the service is about to begin.

17:06.909 --> 17:08.877
Let's talk about this later, okay?

17:08.978 --> 17:10.708
Ladies and gentlemen,

17:10.780 --> 17:14.648
we are here to celebrate
the life of Alma Borland.

17:15.550 --> 17:19.784
A warm, loving woman
who raised two exceptional sons,

17:19.855 --> 17:21.414
Cal and Al.

17:22.625 --> 17:26.255
Her youngest, Al,
would now like to say a few words.

17:36.772 --> 17:39.708
My mother was a great lady.

17:42.845 --> 17:44.404
I'm sorry!

17:46.215 --> 17:48.650
Cal, would you
like to say anything?

17:48.718 --> 17:51.745
I did... Until I talked to Jill.

17:58.160 --> 18:02.188
Would anyone else like to say
a few words to honor Alma?

18:08.471 --> 18:10.702
I'd like to say something.

18:17.279 --> 18:18.279
Uh...

18:18.814 --> 18:20.715
This is hard for me
because as most of you know,

18:20.783 --> 18:25.653
I've spent a lot of years making fun
of Alma on <i>Tool Time.</i>

18:25.721 --> 18:29.351
But what you probably don't know
is that she was...

18:29.425 --> 18:33.385
And there's no delicate way to say this,
but she was a huge fan.

18:37.967 --> 18:41.927
She had a great sense of humor
and a great spirit about her.

18:42.004 --> 18:45.964
Everywhere Alma went, she left
a big impression.

18:49.345 --> 18:52.076
That was her favorite joke.

18:52.381 --> 18:54.680
I owe a lot to that woman.

18:54.750 --> 18:56.522
Without her, I would never have had
the privilege

18:56.552 --> 18:59.021
of knowing my good friend Al.

19:00.856 --> 19:04.418
And I know, Al, that your mom
would want you to share

19:04.527 --> 19:07.656
the love that she gave you
with someone you love.

19:12.768 --> 19:14.737
I didn't mean me.

19:16.705 --> 19:17.866
Thanks, Tim.

19:23.779 --> 19:27.341
My mother was a great woman.
She was my friend,

19:28.584 --> 19:30.678
my supporter,

19:32.521 --> 19:34.786
my teacher. And Tim's right.

19:35.891 --> 19:37.917
She said that there's nothing greater

19:37.993 --> 19:40.963
than sharing your love
with someone else.

19:41.063 --> 19:45.296
And, well, there was something
I was going to do the other night.

19:45.367 --> 19:48.929
And I don't think there's
any reason for putting it off.

19:51.373 --> 19:53.933
Trudy, will you marry me?

20:03.252 --> 20:05.721
Perhaps I've put you on the spot?

20:07.456 --> 20:10.016
Of course I'll marry you, Al.

20:16.131 --> 20:19.966
Al and Trudy,
this is indeed a joyous occasion.

20:22.238 --> 20:25.174
Now, let us proceed to the grave site.

20:26.709 --> 20:30.407
Will the following pallbearers
please take their places?

20:30.479 --> 20:32.744
Al, Cal,

20:32.815 --> 20:35.307
Tim, Brad, Mark,

20:35.384 --> 20:37.546
Marty, Benny,

20:37.720 --> 20:41.885
Patrick, Colin, Francis, Chris,

20:41.991 --> 20:45.484
William, Brian, Jake,

20:45.561 --> 20:48.030
Carson, Ted, Alonzo...

20:55.170 --> 20:56.661
Hi, honey.

20:56.739 --> 20:59.800
Hi. How did the <i>Tool Time</i>
at the granite quarry go?

20:59.875 --> 21:01.969
It was great!

21:02.044 --> 21:04.013
That new executive, Morgan,
didn't drive you nuts?

21:04.079 --> 21:08.380
No, no, no, no. Before we left I had
Heidi make up a special map for him.

21:08.450 --> 21:11.215
He's halfway to Amish country by now.

21:11.287 --> 21:14.018
But Al did ask us for a special favor.

21:14.723 --> 21:15.986
Well, sure. Anything.

21:16.058 --> 21:18.755
He wants to have the wedding
in our backyard.

21:18.827 --> 21:22.992
- What? Why would he want to do that?
- They want someplace that's intimate.

21:23.065 --> 21:24.499
And they're comfortable with it.

21:24.566 --> 21:26.847
And Trudy's house,
that's where she had her first wedding,

21:26.902 --> 21:29.667
- there's bad memories there.
- Oh. Oh.

21:29.772 --> 21:32.537
Well, why don't they have it
in Al's backyard?

21:32.641 --> 21:36.203
Because the landlord keeps
a whole bunch of car parts back there.

21:37.579 --> 21:39.548
You're the landlord.

21:43.052 --> 21:45.214
Do you want me to bring
that crap back here?

21:47.523 --> 21:50.493
We have a beautiful house
for a wedding.

21:56.498 --> 22:00.060
Hello. And a big Binford welcome
back to Binford's <i>Tool Time.</i>

22:00.169 --> 22:02.729
You might notice there's a few changes
here in the set.

22:02.805 --> 22:04.239
Binford's puts its name...

22:06.875 --> 22:09.435
Dirk comes from a long line
of diamond cutters.

22:09.511 --> 22:10.672
Oh, that's right. Yeah.

22:10.746 --> 22:14.205
In fact, I brought some diamonds
cut by my great-grandfather.

22:14.350 --> 22:17.718
Great. Maybe next we can show
the family, show the baby...
