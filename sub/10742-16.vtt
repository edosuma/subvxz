22:41.394 --> 22:42.626
      Jeannie.

22:45.230 --> 22:48.399
            Jeannie? Ready?

22:48.434 --> 22:49.633
Yes, master.

22:51.136 --> 22:52.336
                   Hey.

22:53.639 --> 22:55.105
               Well, well, well.

22:55.140 --> 22:56.840
Do I please thee?

22:56.875 --> 22:59.109
         If it took 2000 years
      for you to look like that,

22:59.144 --> 23:01.745
                 it was worth
                  every day.

23:01.781 --> 23:04.815
You saved my life today.
Thank you.

23:04.850 --> 23:07.250
             Well, you've saved
           my life often enough.

23:07.286 --> 23:09.119
             I guess we're even.

23:09.154 --> 23:10.688
Where shall we go
to dinner tonight?

23:10.723 --> 23:11.689
                     Um--

23:11.724 --> 23:13.924
   I know! I will
 take you to Paris!

23:13.959 --> 23:15.091
No, no, no,
thank you.

23:15.127 --> 23:17.093
I've had enough
traveling for one day.

23:17.129 --> 23:19.296
I'm gonna take you
to dinner.
                   Oh.

23:19.332 --> 23:20.564
In Cocoa Beach?

23:20.599 --> 23:22.299
               Anything you say,
                    master.

23:22.335 --> 23:23.968
Okay. Let's go.

23:25.972 --> 23:27.271
                   [SNAPS]

23:27.306 --> 23:29.306
         Oh, Jeannie, I forgot.
       My car's in the the shop.

23:29.342 --> 23:30.674
               I'll call a cab.

23:30.709 --> 23:32.609
Oh, do not bother,
master.

23:38.517 --> 23:39.817
                Oh, Jeannie,

23:39.852 --> 23:42.118
              it's not happening
                all over again.

23:42.154 --> 23:44.655
  Oh, no, master.

23:44.690 --> 23:46.890
But on a night like this
with a moon,

23:46.925 --> 23:49.360
I thought it would be
more romantic.

23:49.395 --> 23:51.094
                 [CHUCKLES]
                   Okay.

24:30.669 --> 24:33.804
