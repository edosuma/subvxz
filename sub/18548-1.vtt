00:21.280 --> 00:23.320
Oooh!

00:31.360 --> 00:34.999
Mrs McCarthy? We won!
Cheltenham 2-1 Evesham!

00:35.000 --> 00:38.879
Father, in here! You have a visitor.

00:38.880 --> 00:42.319
Canon Fox from the Diocesan Office.

00:42.320 --> 00:44.439
Ah, Father.

00:44.440 --> 00:46.159
I trust there's nothing wrong?

00:46.160 --> 00:47.599
Oh, if there were, you could be sure

00:47.600 --> 00:49.760
Bishop Reynard would be here
in person.

00:50.880 --> 00:55.320
No. Actually, it's about
your Christmas Day Mass.

00:55.360 --> 00:58.160
The nativity procession
is the highlight of our calendar.

00:58.200 --> 01:01.599
It also has a reputation for being
somewhat eclectic

01:01.600 --> 01:05.078
in its interpretation of the Gospel.

01:05.080 --> 01:06.279
Last year, for instance,

01:06.280 --> 01:09.320
Our Lady's arrival at the stable
was on the back of a goat.

01:09.360 --> 01:11.920
Well, we had trouble
finding a donkey.

01:11.960 --> 01:15.199
Where the Christ Child was
worshipped by, amongst others,

01:15.200 --> 01:18.720
five kings, two cocker spaniels

01:18.760 --> 01:20.919
and the Lone Ranger.

01:20.920 --> 01:22.320
Derek Miller.

01:22.360 --> 01:25.920
He made a spirited argument
that if the sheep had shepherds,

01:25.960 --> 01:27.360
the oxen should have cowboys.

01:27.400 --> 01:29.360
It seemed churlish to deny him.

01:31.080 --> 01:35.120
And then there's
your... Sunday school choir.

01:36.360 --> 01:39.839
What they lack in voice,
they make up for in enthusiasm.

01:39.840 --> 01:42.560
It is for the children.
Not this year!

01:44.720 --> 01:49.239
This year, the Duke of Frome
is spending Christmas at Montague.

01:49.240 --> 01:51.999
And, we're informed, will
be attending Christmas Mass

01:52.000 --> 01:53.799
at St Mary's.

01:53.800 --> 01:56.399
As he's Britain's premier
Catholic duke,

01:56.400 --> 02:00.320
we're keen you don't let the side
down, so to speak.

02:00.360 --> 02:03.600
To wit,
I will be attending in person.

02:05.480 --> 02:07.239
And as the reputation of the diocese

02:07.240 --> 02:10.719
rests on a somewhat
dubious precedent,

02:10.720 --> 02:14.560
Bishop Reynard thought it judicious
to put down a few markers.

02:14.600 --> 02:18.800
This year, he wants
the full biblical line-up.

02:18.840 --> 02:21.600
He wants wholesome-looking children.

02:21.640 --> 02:23.679
He wants ox and ass

02:23.680 --> 02:27.000
and chorales that put
King's College, Cambridge to shame.

02:27.040 --> 02:29.200
Damn it, he wants snow!

02:31.480 --> 02:34.040
I'm not sure I can stretch to snow.

02:34.080 --> 02:36.480
Then you'd better get praying.

02:39.052 --> 02:39.153
♪♪

03:34.960 --> 03:36.999
Thank you for coming, Father.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.280
I could curse Monty
for not being here.

03:39.320 --> 03:41.159
Missing the Yuletide ball!

03:41.160 --> 03:42.720
The great and the good.

03:42.760 --> 03:44.239
Oh, I appreciate the moral support.

03:44.240 --> 03:46.600
I'm surprised you need it.
The duke and you are cousins.

03:46.640 --> 03:48.559
You were practically brought up
together.

03:48.560 --> 03:50.400
Oh, John and Diana are lovely.

03:53.200 --> 03:56.319
Good morning, Windy.
Hello, Nanny Langton.

03:56.320 --> 03:59.680
You did well for yourself,
for a redhead.

04:03.760 --> 04:08.200
Diana! John! How lovely to see you!

04:08.240 --> 04:10.120
You remember Father Brown?

04:31.840 --> 04:33.880
Holy Mother...!

04:41.000 --> 04:43.399
He's cold as ice. Oh, goodness!

04:43.400 --> 04:46.280
Poor soul probably froze to death.
Oh!

04:47.600 --> 04:49.320
May his soul rest in peace.

04:49.360 --> 04:52.559
That... was my intention,

04:52.560 --> 04:55.800
until some infernal woman
started squawking!

05:05.960 --> 05:08.639
What are you doing here?

05:08.640 --> 05:10.920
I just wanted to see
where you're billeted.

05:10.960 --> 05:14.040
Can't you see I've work to do?
You don't say.

05:14.080 --> 05:15.919
More precious than baby Jesus,
this one.

05:15.920 --> 05:17.359
Don't call him that.

05:17.360 --> 05:20.439
Why not?
He's a miracle, by all accounts.

05:20.440 --> 05:22.839
What are you doing here?!

05:22.840 --> 05:25.479
One of the cases got mixed up
with the duke's. Huh!

05:25.480 --> 05:27.280
See you around.

05:31.480 --> 05:34.000
Trouble in trousers, that one.

05:34.040 --> 05:36.080
And what he sees in you
is a mystery.

05:40.880 --> 05:45.399
Congratulations on the birth
of your son and heir.

05:45.400 --> 05:48.760
I'm grateful for your
intercessions, Father.

05:48.800 --> 05:51.919
Prayer succeeded
when medicine failed.

05:51.920 --> 05:54.119
Scores of doctors and treatments.

05:54.120 --> 05:56.239
And when we'd finally given up
hope...

05:56.240 --> 05:58.199
Talk of the devil!

05:58.200 --> 06:00.239
John will hold him.

06:00.240 --> 06:01.680
He cries when I do.

06:01.720 --> 06:04.679
I'm not sure that he likes me
very much.

06:06.520 --> 06:08.639
Come here. Hello.

06:08.640 --> 06:13.240
Such a handsome boy!
He looks just like his father.

06:13.280 --> 06:15.959
So, Windy,
where's this husband of yours?

06:15.960 --> 06:18.479
Windy? It's a childhood nickname.

06:18.480 --> 06:21.320
Windermere by name,
bowels like bellows.

06:21.360 --> 06:23.680
Monty's on tour with
Her Majesty, Nanny.

06:23.720 --> 06:25.440
Oh! God bless her.

06:25.480 --> 06:29.920
Did John tell you about our
diamond jubilee party at Frome?

06:29.960 --> 06:32.439
Felicia meant the new queen, Nanny.

06:32.440 --> 06:36.599
I know that. I don't know what
her parents were thinking of,

06:36.600 --> 06:38.760
allowing the girl to marry a Greek!

06:42.240 --> 06:45.280
We do possess
a plentiful supply of cutlery.

06:45.320 --> 06:47.120
Nature's spoons.

06:50.320 --> 06:52.479
His name is Michael Negal.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.640
I found him in the church
half-frozen to death,

06:54.680 --> 06:56.799
so I brought him in for a hot meal.

06:56.800 --> 06:59.040
Not that I've received any thanks.

06:59.080 --> 07:04.240
She woke me from a perfectly good
sleep, and her food's over-salted.

07:08.560 --> 07:11.080
This is a harsh winter
to be sleeping rough.

07:12.320 --> 07:13.919
You could perish.

07:13.920 --> 07:17.400
Oh. Seeing as you ask,
maybe I could stay for a bit.

07:18.600 --> 07:23.000
Odd jobs in return for some grub
and a floor in the church.

07:26.160 --> 07:28.120
I'm afraid that won't be possible.

07:29.560 --> 07:32.600
But there is a room for you here
at the presbytery.

07:34.360 --> 07:36.240
I hope you know what you're doing.

07:37.480 --> 07:40.200
The Bible tells us to be hospitable
to strangers

07:40.240 --> 07:42.399
lest they be angels in disguise.

07:44.240 --> 07:47.040
Well, in that case,
maybe he could take up my offer

07:47.080 --> 07:50.679
of a hot bath
and some clean clothes.

07:50.680 --> 07:52.480
I'm attached to my dirt.

07:52.520 --> 07:55.199
We've been travelling companions
for a long time.

07:55.200 --> 07:57.120
Is there an inside privy?

07:58.200 --> 08:00.080
Upstairs on the left.

08:00.120 --> 08:03.520
Good. Because this stew
will take some shifting.

08:11.120 --> 08:13.120
Time to go to sleep now, David.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.999
Yes, it is.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.920
Night-night. Night-night.

08:26.480 --> 08:29.519
Old bag's nightcap. They're run
off their feet in the kitchen.

08:29.520 --> 08:31.119
Since when were you so considerate?

08:31.120 --> 08:33.359
Since they bunged me
a bottle of champagne.

08:33.360 --> 08:36.200
I thought us two could slip away
and watch the party.

08:36.240 --> 08:39.240
What about Nanny? She'll be dead
to the world in no time.

08:40.919 --> 08:43.120
Half an hour.

08:44.600 --> 08:47.599
Once In Royal David's City

08:56.960 --> 09:00.120
Divine outfit, Mrs M! Oh, good news!

09:00.160 --> 09:02.839
Harry Bainbridge has come up trumps
with a donkey.

09:02.840 --> 09:04.559
He'll be delivered on Christmas Day.

09:04.560 --> 09:07.919
Bless you!
One less thing to worry about.

09:07.920 --> 09:09.519
The honour of the parish
is at stake.

09:09.520 --> 09:12.999
We won't stand accused of letting
the side down.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.159
Where is he? Basil!

09:15.160 --> 09:17.640
If I'd known you were in the area,
I would have invited you.

09:17.680 --> 09:20.600
Delightful to see you too,
Cousin He's here, I take it?

09:22.320 --> 09:24.560
Never mind, I'll find him myself.

09:25.600 --> 09:28.280
A relative of yours? Barely.

09:28.320 --> 09:31.039
Third cousin goodness knows
how many times removed,

09:31.040 --> 09:32.680
and a thoroughly bad lot.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.840
Enjoying the party, Inspector?

09:38.880 --> 09:40.640
Does it look like it?

09:40.680 --> 09:42.640
I hate Christmas.

09:42.680 --> 09:46.720
I hate parties. And I particularly
hate parties with dancing!

09:46.760 --> 09:49.559
Begging the question,
why are you here?

09:49.560 --> 09:51.999
There speaks the voice
of a celibate.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.200
Keep your eyes peeled
when the dancing starts.

09:54.240 --> 09:56.800
5' 7", brown hair, green dress.

09:56.840 --> 09:59.720
If she asks, you haven't seen me!

10:01.040 --> 10:02.800
Aren't you excused?

10:02.840 --> 10:05.640
An attack of gout
doesn't get me a red card.

10:05.680 --> 10:07.640
She merely views it as a challenge.

10:11.760 --> 10:13.720
A bad run of luck!

10:13.760 --> 10:15.959
You expect me to settle
your gambling debts?

10:15.960 --> 10:17.639
My credit isn't what it used to be.

10:17.640 --> 10:20.600
Then you're a damn fool for
borrowing off your expectations.

10:20.640 --> 10:23.080
Think of them as debts of honour.

10:23.120 --> 10:25.079
We wouldn't want a stain
on the family name.

10:25.080 --> 10:28.559
You're family by default, and you've
been staining my name for years.

10:28.560 --> 10:29.960
No more, Basil!

10:31.600 --> 10:33.440
From now on, you're on your own.

10:34.680 --> 10:37.880
If you'll excuse me,
I must join my hostess.

10:37.920 --> 10:39.320
You'll regret this, Cuz!

10:43.920 --> 10:47.039
My apologies.
That was very unbecoming.

10:47.040 --> 10:48.879
It's Basil
who should be apologising.

10:48.880 --> 10:51.519
Will you excuse me
if I go to my room?

10:51.520 --> 10:53.760
I think I'm starting a headache.

10:53.800 --> 10:57.400
As long as you don't mind me
borrowing your husband for dancing.

10:57.440 --> 10:59.600
I'll try not to wake you
when I come up.

11:06.560 --> 11:10.640
Forgive me for saying,
but Diana doesn't seem herself.

11:10.680 --> 11:13.160
Oh, it's nothing.

11:13.200 --> 11:15.160
A touch of the baby blues,
according to Nanny.

11:38.120 --> 11:40.440
God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen

11:44.760 --> 11:48.079
My Lord Duke, lords, ladies
and gentlemen,

11:48.080 --> 11:50.799
dancing will begin in the ballroom.

11:52.440 --> 11:54.480
Mrs Mallory, 6:00.

12:01.800 --> 12:06.040
Sorry to disturb your party, sir,
but the baby marquess is missing.

12:06.080 --> 12:10.720
Trusty Goodfellow! What would I do
without you? Lead on.

12:21.160 --> 12:23.440
There's no sign of forced entry.

12:23.480 --> 12:26.799
My babies' windows are always
left open at night

12:26.800 --> 12:28.960
to let Captain Fresh Air fly in.

12:31.240 --> 12:33.879
And you were...? Watching the party.

12:33.880 --> 12:36.319
I'm so sorry, Your Grace!

12:36.320 --> 12:39.480
No-one blames you, Amy.
You're entitled to some fun.

12:39.520 --> 12:41.000
Were you with anyone?

12:43.120 --> 12:44.639
Oh, you stupid girl!

12:44.640 --> 12:47.000
I warned you he was trouble.

12:47.040 --> 12:49.319
George Parkin, my valet.

12:49.320 --> 12:51.760
Has he been with you long?

12:51.800 --> 12:54.799
About six months,
since leaving the army.

12:54.800 --> 12:58.240
The problem with soldiers is they
can't keep their trousers buttoned.

12:58.280 --> 13:02.240
And you were in bed the entire time?

13:02.280 --> 13:06.159
I'm a very light sleeper,
if you're suggesting what I think.

13:06.160 --> 13:07.600
I'm not suggesting anything, Miss...

13:07.640 --> 13:09.919
It's Nanny Langton to you,

13:09.920 --> 13:12.559
and I've been minding babies
for 50 years.

13:12.560 --> 13:15.320
When they wake, I wake. Yes, ma'am.

13:15.360 --> 13:17.119
Nanny Langton.

13:17.120 --> 13:20.720
You're saying the baby
didn't wake up?

13:20.760 --> 13:23.639
And you can write that down
in your book.

13:23.640 --> 13:25.480
Well, what are you waiting for?

13:27.720 --> 13:29.120
Was anything missing?

13:29.160 --> 13:30.759
His eiderdown, and lamb.

13:30.760 --> 13:32.400
It's his favourite toy.

13:32.440 --> 13:35.839
He's not allowed it at night.
Nanny says he'll get crooked teeth.

13:35.840 --> 13:38.159
But I always put it by his bed
so he can see it.

13:38.160 --> 13:40.280
I fail to see how any of this
will find him.

13:41.960 --> 13:44.559
It appears we're dealing with
a kidnapping,

13:44.560 --> 13:47.399
so you can expect a ransom demand.

13:47.400 --> 13:51.479
I want extra constables,
roadblocks at five miles,

13:51.480 --> 13:53.480
a full search of the grounds,
with dogs,

13:53.520 --> 13:56.080
and a full search of the house,
basement to attic.

13:57.240 --> 14:03.639
In the meantime, until they make
contact, all you can do is wait.

14:03.640 --> 14:05.400
And we will pray.

14:27.840 --> 14:29.440
A terrible business.

14:29.480 --> 14:31.479
We assume it's a kidnapping?

14:31.480 --> 14:33.719
The police seem to think so.

14:33.720 --> 14:35.959
Although as yet,
there's no ransom demand.

14:35.960 --> 14:39.719
Then God willing, he'll be returned
by Christmas. Hm.

14:39.720 --> 14:42.560
In the meantime, arrangements
must proceed as planned.

14:42.600 --> 14:45.120
I trust everything is shipshape
and Bristol?

14:46.320 --> 14:48.959
We have an ox and an ass.

14:48.960 --> 14:52.400
The adult choir has been practising
for weeks

14:52.440 --> 14:55.240
and Dafydd Owen
has agreed to be soloist.

14:55.280 --> 14:58.480
He's Eisteddfod champion tenor.

14:58.520 --> 15:03.599
So we're hoping the Bishop will
overlook the fact he's a Methodist.

15:03.600 --> 15:06.240
Well, it is Christmas.

15:06.280 --> 15:09.239
And I took it upon myself
to take care of the casting,

15:09.240 --> 15:11.520
so there will be no surprises
this year.

15:13.120 --> 15:15.200
Donkey's here. Already?!

15:16.920 --> 15:20.280
Did you not tell him he wasn't
supposed to drop him off
until Christmas Day?

15:20.320 --> 15:21.880
Tell him yourself.

15:45.640 --> 15:47.840
Mrs Hornby says
you're not letting the maids in.

15:49.280 --> 15:52.119
At least let me get these clothes
cleaned.

15:52.120 --> 15:54.160
I know what they're saying.

15:54.200 --> 15:55.999
No-one's saying anything.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.719
That it's my fault.

15:57.720 --> 15:59.640
Why would they say that?

16:00.920 --> 16:02.120
Because they know that I'm...

16:02.160 --> 16:07.000
Because she's got a head filled
with nonsense on an empty stomach.

16:07.040 --> 16:09.200
Beef broth. I made it myself.

16:12.040 --> 16:13.840
I'm not hungry.

16:13.880 --> 16:15.599
And you, you, off with you!

16:15.600 --> 16:18.240
And find something useful to do,
or I'll find it for you.

16:18.280 --> 16:19.680
Yes, Nanny.

16:26.480 --> 16:27.880
Hello.

16:54.480 --> 16:58.279
Padre, in case you hadn't noticed,
this is a crime scene!

16:58.280 --> 17:01.800
Goodfellow, I've got the
Commissioner, Chief Constable,

17:01.840 --> 17:03.880
not to mention
the Home-ruddy-Secretary

17:03.920 --> 17:05.358
breathing down my neck,

17:05.359 --> 17:08.358
so please tell me I've got something
to report back!

17:08.359 --> 17:10.720
They found half-a-dozen sets
of fingerprints, sir,

17:10.760 --> 17:13.559
but no surprises there,
it's the gardeners' ladders,

17:13.560 --> 17:15.400
so they'll have to be eliminated.

17:15.440 --> 17:18.440
Still nothing from the kidnappers?
No, sir.

17:18.480 --> 17:20.398
Inspector Mallory?

17:20.400 --> 17:23.160
I wonder if you would indulge me
in an experiment?

17:27.560 --> 17:29.439
The ground is soft.

17:29.440 --> 17:32.159
But the bottom of the ladder
has barely sunk in.

17:32.160 --> 17:35.319
Spare me the riddles
and get to the point.

17:35.320 --> 17:36.880
May I demonstrate?

17:44.040 --> 17:47.519
I think the Father's trying to say
that... Thank you, Watson!

17:47.520 --> 17:52.079
Which means the kidnappers didn't
gain entry or exit via the ladder.

17:52.080 --> 17:56.480
And then went to great lengths to
make it look like an outside job.

17:56.520 --> 17:59.680
It was the Yuletide ball.
The entire county was here.

17:59.720 --> 18:03.959
But of those,
how many knew where he was sleeping?

18:03.960 --> 18:06.399
Or that his windows
were open at night?

18:06.400 --> 18:08.840
Or to take his favourite toy?

18:08.880 --> 18:10.440
What are you implying?

18:10.480 --> 18:13.319
If you would let me get a word
in edgeways,

18:13.320 --> 18:17.280
I am deducing that the kidnappers
had knowledge of the baby

18:17.320 --> 18:19.199
and his routines.

18:19.200 --> 18:22.800
Which suggests an accomplice
within the family.

18:22.840 --> 18:24.480
That's preposterous!

18:24.520 --> 18:26.719
How many servants
accompanied Your Grace?

18:26.720 --> 18:28.960
Just our nursery maid and my valet.

18:30.200 --> 18:32.199
There's also the nanny.

18:32.200 --> 18:35.640
Nanny is not a servant, Inspector,
more a member of the family.

18:37.280 --> 18:38.919
On the subject of family,

18:38.920 --> 18:43.200
your cousin Mr Urquhart was
conspicuously present last night.

18:43.240 --> 18:45.399
Does anybody know of
his whereabouts?

18:45.400 --> 18:49.079
He's in the Ochre bedroom.
Slightly worse for wear, I'm afraid.

18:49.080 --> 18:51.520
Then I wonder if Your Grace
would permit me to wake him?

18:56.160 --> 18:58.799
The Holly And The Ivy

18:58.800 --> 19:00.999
He looks a bit miserable.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.599
You'd be miserable if you had
to listen to that caterwauling.

19:04.600 --> 19:07.759
My choir is in fine fettle,
thank you very much!

19:07.760 --> 19:10.160
They're flat on the top Cs.

19:10.200 --> 19:12.639
Oh, and you'd know, would you?

19:12.640 --> 19:15.240
I've sang in the finest choir
in existence.

19:15.280 --> 19:17.400
Huh! And what choir would that be
exactly?

19:19.360 --> 19:20.680
Mind your own business.

19:23.640 --> 19:25.600
Mr Urquhart!

19:29.680 --> 19:32.760
You left the party last night
after an argument with the duke.

19:34.200 --> 19:36.880
Keep the volume down.

19:37.960 --> 19:42.079
Every word is like a nail
in my skull.

19:42.080 --> 19:46.959
And approximately half an hour
before the baby was found missing!

19:46.960 --> 19:49.800
Can I ask where you went?

19:49.840 --> 19:52.840
Up here, in search of a bed.

19:54.080 --> 19:58.160
You were conspicuous by your absence
when all the drama was going on.

19:58.200 --> 20:01.479
I was as drunk as a skunk.

20:01.480 --> 20:05.239
Until recently,
YOU were the duke's heir.

20:05.240 --> 20:11.959
Two wars have left the male Langtons
distinctly thin on the ground.

20:11.960 --> 20:15.879
Behold, the bottom of the barrel.

20:15.880 --> 20:20.279
The birth of the marquess
must have come as quite a blow.

20:20.280 --> 20:21.600
Crushing!

20:21.640 --> 20:25.120
But, as I am first to admit,

20:25.160 --> 20:29.440
I would have made
a spectacularly bad duke.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.239
If you're suggesting what I think,

20:33.240 --> 20:36.719
then you're way off the mark,
old chap.

20:36.720 --> 20:40.600
It transpires that the kidnappers
may have had an accomplice

20:40.640 --> 20:42.640
known to the family.

20:42.680 --> 20:45.639
So I'm sure you'll understand
my request

20:45.640 --> 20:48.480
when I say, don't go anywhere
for the time being.

21:00.760 --> 21:04.320
Morning, Miss.
Can I ask what you're doing here?

21:08.520 --> 21:11.080
Do you recognise this woman?

21:11.120 --> 21:12.640
I've never seen her before.

21:12.680 --> 21:16.919
Which is peculiar as she claims
to be the wife of your valet,

21:16.920 --> 21:20.879
despite him telling my sergeant
he was unmarried.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.880
Parkin?

21:22.920 --> 21:24.559
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

21:24.560 --> 21:27.280
He was just out of the army.

21:27.320 --> 21:29.520
He needed a job and it was
a bachelor position.

21:29.560 --> 21:32.600
A man can only serve one master.

21:32.640 --> 21:36.640
I'm not his master, I'm his wife.

21:36.680 --> 21:39.479
And I live in Hambleston.

21:39.480 --> 21:42.360
So when he was here over Christmas,
I just...

21:42.400 --> 21:44.480
I just wanted to give my husband
a Christmas card.

21:50.680 --> 21:55.520
On Christmas morning, under
the mistletoe, remember our kisses.

21:55.560 --> 21:56.959
That's personal.

21:56.960 --> 21:59.240
I can see that. Very poetic!

22:02.400 --> 22:04.839
I will leave whenever
is convenient, Your Grace.

22:04.840 --> 22:08.839
I think His Grace has more pressing
matters on his mind.

22:08.840 --> 22:13.599
Indeed. And I won't punish a man
for wanting to support his family,

22:13.600 --> 22:15.880
nor separate him from his wife.

22:15.920 --> 22:18.359
When... all this is over,

22:18.360 --> 22:21.320
we'll look at moving both of you
into a cottage.

22:23.360 --> 22:25.160
Thank you.

22:29.640 --> 22:31.639
You're doing a fine job.

22:31.640 --> 22:34.519
I was an apprentice to a master
carpenter back in the day.

22:34.520 --> 22:36.120
Back in your daydreams.

22:37.480 --> 22:39.240
The ass has lost its appetite.

22:39.280 --> 22:40.839
Is he ill?

22:40.840 --> 22:42.680
He's missing his friend.

22:42.720 --> 22:45.840
Oh, you speak Donkey as well now,
do you

22:52.400 --> 22:54.960
If you've finished, you can go
to the kitchen for your tea.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.479
Yes, Nanny.

22:56.480 --> 22:57.920
Don't say I didn't warn you.

23:00.160 --> 23:02.960
The likes of him would never be
interested in a girl like you.

23:22.960 --> 23:26.119
Can you confirm
that this is your son's?

23:26.120 --> 23:28.960
I'm not sure. Nanny would know.

23:32.800 --> 23:34.440
I did the embroidery myself.

23:37.600 --> 23:40.720
This means he's been injured,
or worse!

23:40.760 --> 23:44.440
If he's been kidnapped,
they're hardly likely to harm
the golden goose.

23:44.480 --> 23:46.239
Quite.

23:46.240 --> 23:48.599
It's too soon for alarm.

23:48.600 --> 23:51.079
We don't even know
if it's human blood yet.

23:51.080 --> 23:54.160
Get that to Scenes of Crime and tell
them I want the results yesterday!

That's only half the choir.

24:15.480 --> 24:18.319
They're dropping like flies,
I'm afraid.

24:18.320 --> 24:20.800
There's been an outbreak
of laryngitis.

24:20.840 --> 24:22.400
Oh, my mother of God!

24:22.440 --> 24:26.159
It's Christmas Eve -
what are we going to do now?

24:26.160 --> 24:28.559
Don't worry, Mrs McCarthy.

24:28.560 --> 24:30.520
We are small but mighty...

24:32.440 --> 24:34.599
..and Dafydd will carry the day.

24:46.200 --> 24:50.399
This "unusual" interest
started when, exactly?

24:50.400 --> 24:51.639
The minute he arrived.

24:51.640 --> 24:55.080
He was always looking for excuses
to hang round the nursery.

24:55.120 --> 24:57.719
Did it occur to you as odd?

24:57.720 --> 24:58.800
I thought he was...

25:00.120 --> 25:03.319
You thought he was "paying court".

25:03.320 --> 25:06.679
And neglected to tell you
he had a wife.

25:06.680 --> 25:08.519
Not that we....

25:08.520 --> 25:10.040
I'm not that sort of girl.

25:11.120 --> 25:13.759
I don't doubt it for a second.

25:13.760 --> 25:15.799
And on the night in question?

25:15.800 --> 25:18.079
He bought up Nanny's cocoa
from the kitchen.

25:18.080 --> 25:20.479
But I think that was just an excuse
to get me out of there so...

25:20.480 --> 25:22.920
George Parkin
brought the nanny's cocoa?

25:34.080 --> 25:37.320
Our thoughts and prayers
are with you. How is your wife?

25:38.640 --> 25:41.240
I'm afraid she's unwell
and taken to bed.

25:41.280 --> 25:44.240
Forgive me for saying
but, even before this happened,

25:44.280 --> 25:46.520
Diana hasn't seemed herself.

25:46.560 --> 25:48.919
Do you know something?

25:48.920 --> 25:50.520
Diana left the ball to go to bed.

25:52.400 --> 25:54.800
But, the next day,
I found mud on her gown.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.439
I expect she went for a walk.

25:57.440 --> 25:58.440
At night?

25:58.480 --> 26:00.319
It's not unusual.

26:00.320 --> 26:02.800
She's had great trouble sleeping
since David was born.

26:02.840 --> 26:05.159
Hardly surprising
after what she went through.

26:05.160 --> 26:06.799
Nanny! What do you mean?

26:06.800 --> 26:08.360
She gets confused.

26:08.400 --> 26:11.399
We should never have taken her
to that dreadful place.

26:11.400 --> 26:13.520
What place?

26:13.560 --> 26:14.720
John?

26:16.960 --> 26:19.399
Diana had complications
and needed surgery.

26:19.400 --> 26:21.279
There wasn't time
to get to the hospital,

26:21.280 --> 26:23.679
so we were directed
to a maternity home,

26:23.680 --> 26:25.880
where there was a doctor
attending another birth.

26:25.920 --> 26:28.559
"Doctor"? Sawbones!

26:28.560 --> 26:30.680
We nearly lost the both of them.

26:30.720 --> 26:33.400
But, thanks to God, we didn't.

26:33.440 --> 26:37.559
The birth announcement said
that David was born at Frome.

26:37.560 --> 26:39.440
I admit the sin of snobbery.

26:39.480 --> 26:43.160
Well, Cedar House was a facility
for unmarried mothers.

26:43.200 --> 26:46.600
It's hardly an auspicious birthplace
for a future Duke.

26:49.880 --> 26:53.000
Lady Felicia, I need your permission
to make a search.

27:02.880 --> 27:04.440
Sarge!

27:07.080 --> 27:10.360
Right. Let's see if we can find
George Parkin, shall we?

27:44.400 --> 27:45.920
Do you recognise this?

27:48.800 --> 27:51.600
Have trouble sleeping, do we?

27:51.640 --> 27:54.880
If you'd fought in two wars,
then you'd have trouble sleeping.

27:58.560 --> 28:01.440
Ten years in the
Royal Worcester Fusiliers.

28:01.480 --> 28:03.800
Honourable discharge in February.

28:04.920 --> 28:08.879
And then, in April,
you took employment with the Duke

28:08.880 --> 28:11.919
after lying
about your marital status.

28:11.920 --> 28:13.160
I explained that.

28:14.560 --> 28:16.840
Your wife
is a very attractive woman.

28:16.880 --> 28:21.679
Leaving me pondering your interest
in Miss Amy who...

28:21.680 --> 28:24.840
let's just say wouldn't win prizes
in a beauty contest.

28:26.400 --> 28:27.560
Men will be men.

28:27.600 --> 28:30.199
And a man like you
could have his pick.

28:30.200 --> 28:32.640
I'd wager,
under normal circumstances,

28:32.680 --> 28:34.679
you wouldn't look at her twice.

28:34.680 --> 28:36.280
And so to the night in question,

28:36.320 --> 28:40.480
when you brought the Nanny's cocoa
to the nursery...

28:40.520 --> 28:42.159
The kitchen were run off their feet.

28:42.160 --> 28:44.839
And here's the coincidence.

28:44.840 --> 28:49.960
The dregs of the cocoa were tested
and found to contain Nembutal.

28:51.440 --> 28:55.080
Coincidentally, the very same drug
we found in your possession.

28:56.320 --> 28:58.880
Like you say - coincidence.

29:00.280 --> 29:02.480
Too many for my liking.

29:02.520 --> 29:04.719
So I'll ask you the question again -

29:04.720 --> 29:06.559
who were you working with?

29:06.560 --> 29:08.560
And I'll tell you again -

29:08.600 --> 29:10.400
it had nothing to do with me.

29:14.800 --> 29:16.319
Oh. Anything, sir?

29:16.320 --> 29:17.920
A big, fat nothing.

29:17.960 --> 29:19.159
Hm.

29:19.160 --> 29:21.399
The Chief Constable
wants you to call him back,

29:21.400 --> 29:23.639
and Mrs Mallory phoned again
to remind you

29:23.640 --> 29:26.000
that the shops shut early
on Christmas Eve.

29:27.960 --> 29:29.200
Padre.

29:30.560 --> 29:34.279
I don't suppose you're here
to wish me a merry Christmas.

29:34.280 --> 29:37.560
I heard that you had made an arrest
and I was wondering...

29:37.600 --> 29:39.279
If you could have a good snoop?

29:39.280 --> 29:40.800
..if I could do anything?

29:40.840 --> 29:44.959
Only if you could add professional
torturer to your list of skills.

29:44.960 --> 29:46.559
So he's admitted nothing?

29:46.560 --> 29:49.400
And he's as guilty as sin.
I can smell it on him.

29:50.640 --> 29:52.439
I want to see my husband.

29:52.440 --> 29:54.240
Out of the question.

29:54.280 --> 29:58.359
He's under arrest on suspicion
of conspiracy to kidnap.

29:58.360 --> 30:01.599
But as you're here, Mrs Parkin,
maybe we could have a chat?

30:01.600 --> 30:03.280
I've nothing to say.

30:03.320 --> 30:06.080
I don't need to remind you
that a baby is missing.

30:07.400 --> 30:11.560
So if there's anything at all
you want to get off your chest...?

30:13.600 --> 30:15.799
I can tell you this.

30:15.800 --> 30:20.480
I swear on God's word
that my husband is innocent.

30:21.920 --> 30:25.359
Then you'd better pray he turns up
without a scratch,

30:25.360 --> 30:28.080
or your husband will be facing
a murder charge.

30:28.120 --> 30:31.600
And there isn't a jury in England
that wouldn't see him hanged!

30:34.280 --> 30:35.720
You're making a mistake.

30:35.760 --> 30:37.359
See her out, Sergeant.

30:37.360 --> 30:38.879
Yes, sir.

30:38.880 --> 30:40.999
This way, madam.
I-I just want to speak to him.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.880
Is that really too much to ask?

30:55.640 --> 30:57.240
Merry Christmas, my Lady.

30:57.280 --> 31:00.720
Merry Christmas, Father.
I came to light a candle for David.

31:07.440 --> 31:09.280
I take it there's still no ransom.

31:10.440 --> 31:11.920
John's beside himself.

31:13.320 --> 31:16.560
He's determined to attend
Christmas Mass, however.

31:18.280 --> 31:21.439
It seems terrible to be celebrating
the birth of one child

31:21.440 --> 31:25.080
when your own is....

31:31.800 --> 31:32.800
Hello, David.

31:34.440 --> 31:36.239
Hello.

31:36.240 --> 31:37.880
'Back with his parents,
sir.'

31:39.400 --> 31:40.920
Not a scratch on him.

31:40.960 --> 31:43.880
At least it seems
he was well looked after.

31:43.920 --> 31:45.880
Indeed it is, sir.

31:48.080 --> 31:49.880
Yes, sir. And to you, too.

31:51.920 --> 31:54.240
I suppose that means Christmas
dinner with the family.

31:54.280 --> 31:56.320
You suppose wrong.

31:56.360 --> 31:57.840
The baby may be back,

31:57.880 --> 32:00.040
but his kidnappers
are still at large.

32:01.360 --> 32:03.079
Well, cheer up.

32:03.080 --> 32:04.640
Who'd want to be stuck at home,

32:04.680 --> 32:07.559
surrounded by stockings
and screaming children,

32:07.560 --> 32:10.600
when there's villains to apprehend?

32:24.640 --> 32:26.239
Once we nabbed the valet,

32:26.240 --> 32:29.480
the kidnappers knew we were
closing in and panicked.

32:29.520 --> 32:31.319
You still think he's involved?

32:31.320 --> 32:35.360
He's guilty as Bluebeard, and his
accomplice is still out there.

32:35.400 --> 32:37.400
Was the church locked
after Midnight Mass?

32:37.440 --> 32:39.039
The church is never locked.

32:39.040 --> 32:41.079
And the baby was found
at seven in the morning,

32:41.080 --> 32:43.800
which gives us a window
of approximately... Sir!

32:46.200 --> 32:48.760
Your secret's safe with me, Padre.

32:54.280 --> 32:58.480
Merry Christmas. Ah, yes,
and merry Christmas to you too.

33:04.520 --> 33:07.879
Dafydd's down
with the laryngitis now.

33:07.880 --> 33:09.080
Could be worse.

33:09.120 --> 33:13.160
We've no soloist, we've half a choir
and a missing donkey.

33:14.400 --> 33:17.040
Exactly how could it be worse?

33:25.040 --> 33:27.399
You slept in the church last night.

33:27.400 --> 33:29.199
Well, it's better than up there.

33:29.200 --> 33:33.720
The mattress is all lumpy and you
snore like an elephant in heat.

33:33.760 --> 33:35.040
I have a question.

33:35.080 --> 33:37.520
Oh, I hate questions.

33:37.560 --> 33:41.399
But as it's Christmas, I'll let you
have one. And an answer.

33:41.400 --> 33:43.000
The sacristy door was locked,

33:43.040 --> 33:45.039
which means that anyone
entering the church

33:45.040 --> 33:47.079
would have to pass by
the confessional.

33:47.080 --> 33:48.320
That's not a question.

33:51.360 --> 33:52.560
Who did you see?

33:57.000 --> 33:58.639
Jocabed.

33:58.640 --> 34:00.280
Now, what's that supposed to mean?

34:00.320 --> 34:02.719
That's two questions.
And I have places to be.

34:02.720 --> 34:05.960
And where do you have to be
that's so important on Christmas?

34:06.000 --> 34:09.000
I have to see a sheep
about a donkey.

34:09.040 --> 34:11.719
Talking in riddles as usual.

34:11.760 --> 34:14.119
And who is Jocabed
when he's at home?

34:14.120 --> 34:15.199
She.

34:16.320 --> 34:18.159
Moses' mother.

34:19.280 --> 34:23.039
Who put the child in a basket
and hid it in the bulrushes.

34:23.040 --> 34:26.359
Where he was found
by Pharaoh's daughter...

34:26.360 --> 34:27.560
and raised a prince.

34:28.920 --> 34:31.478
Well, now, where are YOU off to?

34:31.480 --> 34:34.039
Canon Fox will be here...

34:35.719 --> 34:36.840
..in an hour

34:38.920 --> 34:41.199
Have you news about my husband?

34:43.960 --> 34:45.199
He's still under arrest,

34:45.199 --> 34:48.239
and the police are looking
for his accomplice.

34:48.239 --> 34:51.079
Contrary to appearance,
the Inspector is no fool,

34:51.080 --> 34:53.920
and it's only a matter of time
before he works it out.

34:55.360 --> 34:56.520
Works out what?

34:57.560 --> 34:58.800
Mind if I sit down?

35:10.000 --> 35:12.520
That it was you
who left the baby in the church.

35:14.840 --> 35:17.040
You-you don't understand.

35:17.080 --> 35:20.119
I understand
a lot more than you think.

35:20.120 --> 35:22.960
I know that David
was born in Cedar House...

35:24.720 --> 35:28.320
..and that another mother
gave birth that night.

35:30.840 --> 35:32.040
Was that woman you?

35:38.600 --> 35:40.639
The Duchess of Frome
has just arrived

35:40.640 --> 35:42.200
with suspected pre-eclampsia.

35:42.240 --> 35:45.520
Get some drugs in her and get it out
as quickly as possible.

35:48.560 --> 35:50.160
Forgive me...

35:53.720 --> 35:58.319
..but, um, I thought
that your poetic skills

35:58.320 --> 35:59.920
left much to be desired.

36:01.360 --> 36:04.440
Until I realised
that is was an acrostic.

36:05.840 --> 36:07.840
You swore on God's word...

36:09.280 --> 36:11.360
..that your husband was innocent.

36:11.400 --> 36:15.160
And I think that you
were telling the truth.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.439
Because you can't steal...

36:19.440 --> 36:20.760
what is yours.

36:27.960 --> 36:30.599
They are the thieves.

36:30.600 --> 36:33.039
They stole our child.

36:33.040 --> 36:34.200
Where's my baby?

36:34.240 --> 36:37.399
I'm afraid he didn't
survive the night.

36:37.400 --> 36:38.520
No!

36:39.560 --> 36:42.120
That's not true. You're lying!
Now then...

36:42.160 --> 36:45.239
Please say you're lying!
There's no need for hysterics.

36:45.240 --> 36:47.679
You'd only have given him up
for adoption.

36:47.680 --> 36:48.680
'Wasn't true.'

36:50.520 --> 36:52.719
We were keeping him.

36:52.720 --> 36:56.799
George and I were getting married
as soon as he was back from Korea.

36:56.800 --> 37:00.080
Instead, he returned to find
his son was dead.

37:02.600 --> 37:03.920
How did you know?

37:05.560 --> 37:07.000
When I saw this.

37:18.560 --> 37:24.079
When he was born,
I saw it as clearly as I see you.

37:25.400 --> 37:27.720
Is it... Is it a boy or girl?

37:27.760 --> 37:31.759
'And I remember thinking, if it
was a girl, we'd call her Stella.'

37:31.760 --> 37:33.159
Star.

37:33.160 --> 37:35.440
And what if it was a boy?

37:35.480 --> 37:38.000
Jacob, after my father.

37:40.080 --> 37:44.040
When George got the job,
it wasn't to...

37:45.960 --> 37:47.360
Not at first.

37:49.240 --> 37:54.920
We just wanted to know
that he was happy and loved.

37:57.160 --> 37:58.360
That's rich.

37:59.560 --> 38:01.839
Left in the care
of a senile old woman

38:01.840 --> 38:05.879
while his so-called "mother" could
hardly even bear to look at him.

38:05.880 --> 38:08.480
'All we did was take back
what was ours.

38:09.560 --> 38:11.919
'He didn't make a sound.

38:11.920 --> 38:14.640
'It was like he recognised me.'

38:20.480 --> 38:21.879
Ah!

38:21.880 --> 38:24.159
'The nightdress would have
given him away at once,

38:24.160 --> 38:25.680
'so I had to get rid of it.'

38:27.520 --> 38:30.040
Ah. The blood was yours.

38:31.240 --> 38:32.680
They thought he was dead.

38:34.320 --> 38:38.199
They would have hanged
his own father for murder.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.840
You could have gone to the police.

38:44.880 --> 38:47.920
The word of a servant
over that of a duke?

38:49.400 --> 38:51.760
The word of a duke...

38:51.800 --> 38:54.560
is NOTHING to God.

38:57.440 --> 38:58.680
How...?

39:00.000 --> 39:03.159
Where on Earth did you find him?

39:03.160 --> 39:06.400
They share a field.
They don't like being separated.

39:08.640 --> 39:10.200
And where are you off to now?

39:11.440 --> 39:13.840
Oh... Come on.

39:15.120 --> 39:16.120
Come on.

39:36.320 --> 39:37.680
God heard your prayers.

39:40.120 --> 39:41.960
And sent us a Christmas miracle.

39:44.800 --> 39:46.399
What can I do for you, Father?

39:46.400 --> 39:48.559
I came to offer my condolences

39:48.560 --> 39:50.080
on the death of your son.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.280
I suppose I always knew
the truth would out.

40:04.640 --> 40:06.320
I can explain.

40:06.360 --> 40:07.560
I can't wait to hear it.

40:09.200 --> 40:10.520
Diana nearly died.

40:12.600 --> 40:14.840
She needed an operation
and it caused...

40:17.560 --> 40:20.719
The doctor said that she would
never bear another child.

40:20.720 --> 40:23.120
And as for our son, he was weak.

40:23.160 --> 40:24.400
Fighting for his life.

40:24.440 --> 40:26.039
God gives strength

40:26.040 --> 40:27.240
to those that need it.

40:28.880 --> 40:31.040
He gave this one strength
enough for two.

40:32.200 --> 40:35.560
A misbegotten by-blow
destined for adoption.

40:35.600 --> 40:38.800
Your son carries the weight of
destiny on his shoulders.

40:40.040 --> 40:42.080
They seem such fragile shoulders.

40:43.600 --> 40:45.559
Your Grace...

40:45.560 --> 40:48.400
Your Grace? There's no need
for alarm. It's good news.

40:48.440 --> 40:51.919
The Marquess has rallied
and is out of danger.

40:51.920 --> 40:53.640
Would you like to hold your son?

41:01.320 --> 41:04.400
I'm afraid he became poorly
and died during the night.

41:04.440 --> 41:05.839
It's a shame.

41:05.840 --> 41:07.680
There's a waiting list for boys.

41:08.880 --> 41:10.440
At least he won't be mourned.

41:13.160 --> 41:14.760
It's for the best.

41:16.640 --> 41:19.640
You knew, but you told no-one.

41:22.720 --> 41:25.040
We don't expect your
sort to understand.

41:26.400 --> 41:28.959
Centuries of duty and obligation,

41:28.960 --> 41:33.440
destroyed in a generation
by a black sheep named Urquhart.

41:35.600 --> 41:37.719
Did you tell your wife?

41:37.720 --> 41:39.239
That the child she'd prayed for,

41:39.240 --> 41:41.840
the only child she would ever
bear was dead?

41:41.880 --> 41:45.039
Someone else would only have
adopted him. No harm done.

41:45.040 --> 41:46.160
No harm?

41:47.880 --> 41:52.360
A mother who mourned him
day and night.

41:53.600 --> 41:59.080
And a father in prison for kidnap.

42:01.720 --> 42:02.920
Parkin?

42:05.360 --> 42:07.360
Oh, dear God, what have I done?

42:07.400 --> 42:08.840
Nothing.

42:08.880 --> 42:11.839
You've done nothing.

42:11.840 --> 42:14.680
Do you think anyone will pay heed
to these ramblings?

42:14.720 --> 42:16.959
Listen to Nanny, John.

42:16.960 --> 42:19.400
Think of your position.

42:19.440 --> 42:20.600
His position...

42:22.000 --> 42:24.520
..means NOTHING to God.

42:28.600 --> 42:30.599
There, now. Ssh, ssh, ssh...

42:30.600 --> 42:31.600
What must I do?

42:34.840 --> 42:36.840
What any man would do.

42:41.920 --> 42:43.520
I don't defend my actions.

42:45.640 --> 42:48.440
But had I known he was wanted,
I would never have kept silent.

42:51.680 --> 42:54.280
That woman stole my child.

42:54.320 --> 42:55.919
She acted on my behalf.

42:55.920 --> 42:58.360
The responsibility is mine
and mine alone.

43:01.800 --> 43:03.360
I told myself it was for others.

43:04.480 --> 43:05.880
To spare my wife's grief, to...

43:07.000 --> 43:09.600
..safeguard our family name,
but in truth...

43:12.240 --> 43:15.720
..it was my selfish desire for a son
that blinded my integrity.

43:18.520 --> 43:20.200
What's to be done?

43:22.880 --> 43:26.000
I will inform the authorities
and take my punishment

43:26.040 --> 43:27.880
like the honourable man I once was.

43:31.040 --> 43:32.280
And may God forgive me.

43:32.320 --> 43:33.400
That's not in doubt.

43:35.520 --> 43:37.520
The question is, Hannah,

43:37.560 --> 43:39.800
can you find it in your
heart to show mercy?

43:44.560 --> 43:47.160
I lost one son.

43:47.200 --> 43:48.480
You've lost two.

43:50.120 --> 43:52.120
It's punishment enough for any man.

43:58.680 --> 43:59.960
May I say goodbye?

44:14.160 --> 44:15.680
You be good for your parents.

44:15.720 --> 44:16.960
Hmm?

44:19.240 --> 44:20.240
Make them proud.

44:48.440 --> 44:50.280
The babies were

44:50.320 --> 44:53.160
"accidentally" switched at birth?

44:55.680 --> 44:59.239
Lest there be any doubt, I've
informed the relevant authorities

44:59.240 --> 45:02.280
including the Chief Inspector
and the Home Secretary.

45:04.280 --> 45:06.159
And this has only just come to light

45:06.160 --> 45:09.280
due to the timely intervention
of Father Brown.

45:13.280 --> 45:14.960
Oh, I'm late for Mass.

45:16.480 --> 45:19.520
And Mrs McCarthy will no doubt be
having an apoplexy.

45:26.280 --> 45:29.280
I trust the case is now closed

45:29.320 --> 45:30.520
and Parkin will be released

45:30.560 --> 45:33.400
so that he can spend
Christmas with his wife and...

45:35.240 --> 45:36.240
..and child.

45:39.760 --> 45:41.200
I'm very sorry for your loss.

45:44.240 --> 45:45.960
Thank you, Inspector.

45:53.680 --> 45:54.920
Is everything all right, sir?

45:56.400 --> 45:57.920
The thing about kids is...

45:59.160 --> 46:03.160
..they might
be pains in the backside,

46:03.200 --> 46:05.080
but at least they're your pains
in the backside.

46:07.520 --> 46:08.880
Amen to that.

46:18.560 --> 46:21.640
So we have a half-strength
choir and no soloist.

46:21.680 --> 46:25.800
On the bright side, there is a
donkey albeit with no passenger.

46:25.840 --> 46:28.399
I assume Our Lady will be
making an appearance?

46:28.400 --> 46:31.080
Yes, yes. Peggy Harrington.

46:31.120 --> 46:32.679
This year's Queen of the May.

46:32.680 --> 46:35.840
Lady Felicia
has just gone to fetch her.

46:35.880 --> 46:37.920
Bad news, I'm afraid.

46:37.960 --> 46:41.600
It seems Peggy received a pair of
roller skates from Father Christmas.

46:41.640 --> 46:44.040
And what has that got to do
with the price of figs?

46:44.080 --> 46:45.240
Where is she?

46:45.280 --> 46:46.679
The Cottage Hospital

46:46.680 --> 46:49.119
with a sprained ankle
and a concussion.

46:49.120 --> 46:51.560
Chin up, Mrs M.
We'll just have to improvise.

46:59.720 --> 47:02.359
I knew you'd do the right thing.

47:02.360 --> 47:04.960
I don't dare hope
for your forgiveness.

47:06.200 --> 47:10.840
When he looked at me,
I saw hatred in his eyes.

47:11.960 --> 47:13.959
I thought it was me.

47:13.960 --> 47:16.720
That I was going mad.

47:16.760 --> 47:21.720
That I was wicked and unnatural
for not loving him.

47:23.640 --> 47:25.200
Now I think he knew.

47:26.960 --> 47:28.720
We both knew.

47:28.760 --> 47:31.400
It was an unforgivable deception.

47:31.440 --> 47:34.360
You did it because
you love me, John.

47:34.400 --> 47:35.760
I won't hate you for that.

47:38.360 --> 47:40.519
Inspector Mallory.

47:40.520 --> 47:42.319
Happy Christmas.

47:42.320 --> 47:45.280
Erm... I wonder if I might
beg a favour?

47:47.400 --> 47:48.960
Shall we make a start?

48:04.360 --> 48:09.480
♪ Once in royal David's city

48:09.520 --> 48:14.560
♪ Stood a lowly cattle shed

48:14.600 --> 48:19.719

48:57.720 --> 49:00.519
And they found Mary and Joseph

49:00.520 --> 49:03.600
and the Infant lying in a manger.

49:05.200 --> 49:07.839
And seeing, they understood the word

49:07.840 --> 49:11.120
that had been spoken to them
concerning this child.

49:13.760 --> 49:17.000
- This is the word of the Lord.
- Thanks be to God.

49:17.040 --> 49:20.040
And now, we will stand

49:20.080 --> 49:23.120
and sing hymn number 35.

49:23.160 --> 49:26.480
While Shepherds Watched

49:31.000 --> 49:32.520
Are you still unwell?

49:33.840 --> 49:35.080
The doctor came.

49:36.640 --> 49:37.640
I'm not ill, John.

49:38.760 --> 49:40.759
I'm with child.

49:40.760 --> 49:42.920
Around four months he said.

50:00.520 --> 50:03.720
I am sorry.
Of course you must go.

50:03.760 --> 50:06.359
We feel terrible leaving you alone
on Christmas day.

50:06.360 --> 50:07.959
Oh, don't worry about me.

50:07.960 --> 50:11.639
I'll be fine with a few brandy
cherries and the Queen's speech.

50:11.640 --> 50:13.679
She will not be alone.

50:13.680 --> 50:16.560
Not when there's turkey enough
for ten in the Presbytery.

50:16.600 --> 50:18.559
Gosh. Really?

50:18.560 --> 50:21.199
Yes. You can help me peel
the sprouts.

50:21.200 --> 50:22.400
Of course.

50:25.760 --> 50:29.240
Goodbye, Father,
and thank you for everything.

50:30.640 --> 50:32.360
God be with you both.

50:32.400 --> 50:36.199
Please convey my compliments
to Bishop Reynard and inform him

50:36.200 --> 50:40.039
I've never experienced
a more uplifting Mass.

50:40.040 --> 50:42.720
Well, we aim to please.

50:55.320 --> 50:57.759
They're full of seasonal spirit.

50:57.760 --> 51:00.920
Although I won't be much of
a Santa Claus this year.

51:00.960 --> 51:04.359
Still, it's not all about
presents, is it?

51:04.360 --> 51:06.600
Actually, sir, I did some shopping
myself yesterday

51:06.640 --> 51:08.119
and took the liberty

51:08.120 --> 51:10.119
just in case you didn't get time.

51:10.120 --> 51:13.440
There's a model Spitfire and
one of those music boxes

51:13.480 --> 51:14.640
with the ballerina

51:14.680 --> 51:16.439
and a bottle of Elizabeth Arvon,

51:16.440 --> 51:18.640
which Mrs Goodfellow
is very partial to.

51:23.360 --> 51:24.760
Thank you, Sergeant.

51:24.800 --> 51:28.199
That's... very thoughtful.

51:28.200 --> 51:29.560
You're welcome, Sir.

51:31.480 --> 51:32.520
Merry Christmas.

51:34.320 --> 51:36.120
Merry Christmas, Goodfellow.

51:43.280 --> 51:45.480
Best be off. Donkey needs feeding.

51:54.520 --> 51:55.839
Would you get a move on?

51:55.840 --> 51:57.920
At this rate,
we'll be eating them raw.

52:04.280 --> 52:07.720
Oh, you really don't know
how to peel a sprout, do you?

52:07.760 --> 52:10.359
There's more than one way
to skin a cat, Mrs M.

52:10.360 --> 52:14.880
Yes, well, the next time I meet
a cat peeling sprouts like that,

52:14.920 --> 52:17.759
I'll make sure... Mrs M.

52:17.760 --> 52:18.999
Another sherry.

52:19.000 --> 52:20.400
Oh! Thank you.

52:22.880 --> 52:23.880
Absent friends.

52:26.200 --> 52:28.000
Happy Christmas, Sid.

52:28.040 --> 52:29.600
Happy Christmas, Sid.
Happy Christmas.

52:34.040 --> 52:37.000
Now, where has that Michael got to?

52:37.040 --> 52:39.920
He went to feed the donkey.

52:39.960 --> 52:41.960
He's nothing but trouble that man.

52:44.160 --> 52:46.240
Are you sure that's where he went?

52:46.280 --> 52:47.840
I don't see any footprints.

52:52.080 --> 52:54.639
Oh. Perhaps he's
a Christmas miracle.

52:54.640 --> 52:57.199
Now you're being ridiculous.

52:57.200 --> 52:59.199
The thing about miracles

52:59.200 --> 53:00.440
is that they do happen.
