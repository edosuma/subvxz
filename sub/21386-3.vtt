WEBVTT

00:07.758 --> 00:09.749
Kane is in the building, nigga...

00:23.065 --> 00:26.193
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top

00:26.277 --> 00:29.895
When only heaven ’3 right above it, we on

00:30.865 --> 00:32.730
’Cause we on

00:32.825 --> 00:35.737
Who else is really trying to fuck
with Hollywood Cole?

00:35.828 --> 00:37.409
I’m with Marley G, bro

00:37.496 --> 00:40.488
Flying Holly Grove chicks
to my Hollywood shows

00:40.583 --> 00:43.416
And / wanna tell you
something that you probably should know

00:43.502 --> 00:46.630
This that
Slumdog Millionaire Bol/ywood flow

00:46.714 --> 00:48.045
And...

00:48.299 --> 00:50.164
My real friends never hearing from me

00:50.259 --> 00:53.717
Fake friends write the wrong
answers on the mirror for me

00:53.804 --> 00:56.671
That’s why / pick and choose
/ don ’t get shit confused

00:56.766 --> 01:00.099
Don ’t like my women sing/e
/ like my chicks in twos

01:00.436 --> 01:02.768
And these days all the girls
is down to roll

01:02.855 --> 01:05.562
/ hit the strip club
and all them bitches ﬁnd the pole

01:06.442 --> 01:09.058
Plus, lbeen sippin’
So this shit is movin’ kinda slow

01:09.278 --> 01:12.566
Just tell my girl
to tell her friend that it’s time to go

01:18.412 --> 01:20.573
-There he is.
-JOE: El capitan.

01:20.665 --> 01:21.905
King of the seven seas.

01:22.333 --> 01:26.076
I pilot this boat a whole lot better
than you drive a monster truck.

01:27.296 --> 01:29.082
It was good promotion for the deal.

01:29.173 --> 01:32.381
It's a puff piece in a gossip rag
owned by Wayne Hastings.

01:32.677 --> 01:34.588
Pass me my robe and don't look at me.

01:35.012 --> 01:38.345
SPENCER: Well, 600,000 Las Vegans
read this gossip rag.

01:38.891 --> 01:41.678
You know what they say,
no such thing as bad press, right?

01:42.478 --> 01:45.390
I think Vernon Littelfield
would beg to differ, don't you?

01:45.606 --> 01:46.641
And what's the point?

01:46.732 --> 01:49.724
What exactly are you trying
to promote with this stunt?

01:49.819 --> 01:51.901
Bringing football to Vegas,
says right here.

01:51.988 --> 01:54.445
Spencer got the support of the mayor
and a key committee member.

01:54.657 --> 01:56.989
-What's in it for us?
-Money. As always, money.

01:57.493 --> 02:00.200
-Real|y? How much?
-Well, that's not really clear yet.

02:00.288 --> 02:02.199
It better become crystal clear real fast

02:02.498 --> 02:04.659
'cause I'm not letting
Evel Knievel over there

02:04.750 --> 02:06.411
run amok flipping monster trucks

02:06.502 --> 02:08.618
orjumping a motorcycle
over the Grand Canyon

02:08.754 --> 02:11.166
just to announce to the world
that he's Mr. Las Vegas.

02:11.257 --> 02:13.339
-Who's financing this thing?
-Wayne Hastings says

02:13.426 --> 02:15.508
he's gonna give us big money
if the deal looks right.

02:15.594 --> 02:17.380
You're simple enough
to take his word for it?

02:17.471 --> 02:19.211
The process started three days ago.

02:19.307 --> 02:20.797
We have Wayne Hastings in our corner,

02:20.891 --> 02:22.927
we have the entire city
of Las Vegas on our side.

02:23.019 --> 02:24.805
I'd say we're moving
at fucking light speed.

02:24.895 --> 02:26.510
MR. ANDERSON:
But the people still have to vote.

02:26.814 --> 02:28.930
So unless I see legislation passed

02:29.025 --> 02:31.516
and a big, giant fucking check cleared

02:31.694 --> 02:32.979
and sitting on my desk,

02:33.279 --> 02:35.361
I'm gonna stand by my skepticism.

02:35.573 --> 02:37.484
I'm flying out
to see Schlereth in LA today.

02:37.575 --> 02:39.236
He's gonna give me
some good inside dope,

02:39.327 --> 02:41.443
and the Raiders wanna
talk about relocation.

02:41.537 --> 02:44.495
Now, if I can convince the team that
that move is good for their business,

02:44.582 --> 02:46.493
then it puts us in a position
where we can change

02:46.584 --> 02:48.120
the entire landscape of the NFL.

02:48.377 --> 02:49.753
We'll be vanguards, Bret,

02:50.921 --> 02:52.786
and our company will cash in huge.

02:52.882 --> 02:54.668
Who said you could use my first name?

02:54.842 --> 02:56.878
Bret, Bret, you're gonna be
the toast of Las Vegas.

02:56.969 --> 02:59.301
It's the reason why you wanted
to get in the casino business

02:59.388 --> 03:00.969
with Wayne Hastings in the first place.

03:01.057 --> 03:02.797
You're gonna get it
right in the teeth here.

03:02.892 --> 03:04.883
-You know that, right?
-Right in the teeth, great.

03:04.977 --> 03:06.968
That's where I like it.
I played fucking football.

03:07.063 --> 03:08.098
Come on.

03:08.272 --> 03:09.307
JOE: Manatee!

03:10.066 --> 03:12.057
It’s been a tumultuous
couple years for you

03:12.151 --> 03:13.857
down in Miami from the Bullyinggate

03:14.070 --> 03:16.937
to missing on free agents
like Mike Wallace

03:17.031 --> 03:18.942
to even having
one of your players’ wives

03:19.533 --> 03:21.649
rip on your quarterback Ryan Tannehill.

03:21.744 --> 03:23.450
And despite you guys
making the playoffs,

03:23.537 --> 03:26.370
there ’s still somewhat of a toxic
environment down there. Explain.

03:26.457 --> 03:27.822
We made some mistakes, sure,

03:28.250 --> 03:29.865
but we learned from them and persevered.

03:29.960 --> 03:32.451
/ like to think the adversity has
fueled our success.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.411
Look at Seifert's posture. Easy smile,

03:34.507 --> 03:36.964
-not a hint of defensiveness.
-What's your point?

03:37.301 --> 03:39.838
Sometimes the best way to improve
is to watch a pro.

03:39.929 --> 03:42.045
JAY: The best way to success
is through the draft,

03:42.139 --> 03:43.845
but you didn’t really hit
on those draft picks.

03:43.933 --> 03:45.719
A few fell short of expectations.

03:45.810 --> 03:47.141
Well, you did ﬁnd one guy,

03:47.228 --> 03:50.265
and that’s an undrafted rookie
free agent center

03:50.356 --> 03:51.391
in Anthony Sutton.

03:51.607 --> 03:53.222
LARRY: Yes, he has done a fantastic job.

03:53.317 --> 03:54.602
Was that just a lucky ﬁnd?

03:54.693 --> 03:57.070
-Hell, no! That was my man's pick.
-(SHUSH|NG)

03:57.154 --> 04:00.021
LARRY: Lot of doubt about the kid,
but I wouldn’t say we got lucky.

04:00.116 --> 04:01.731
I spent some time
with him down in Athens

04:01.826 --> 04:03.817
and saw he would
walk a straight line and deliver.

04:03.911 --> 04:05.367
JAY: So, this was you
hands-on with him?

04:05.454 --> 04:06.910
/ impressed the importance

04:06.997 --> 04:08.953
of being somewhere with
a strong support system,

04:09.041 --> 04:10.076
where he could grow.

04:10.167 --> 04:12.624
/ did the same thing with Tunsil,
and look how well he turned out.

04:12.711 --> 04:14.167
Any extra convincing
to come down to Miami?

04:14.255 --> 04:17.088
LARRY: (LAUGHS) Just a lot of frank
conversation over a healthy meal or two.

04:17.174 --> 04:19.381
-Healthy meal at Mama Jewel’s?
-Mama Jewel’s, indeed.

04:19.468 --> 04:21.459
Well, I’d sign with the Dolphins
for Mama Jewel’s.

04:21.554 --> 04:23.886
-LARRY: There it is.
-Guess ljust learned to lie like a pro.

04:24.181 --> 04:25.466
JAY: That was different with Sutton.

04:25.558 --> 04:27.469
LARRY: lmean, look, Sutton knew
he had hard work ahead,

04:27.560 --> 04:29.767
/ told him that he needed to
improve at the drive line.

04:29.854 --> 04:32.596
Is there any way that you can move
my LA Live meeting to 2:00 pm?

04:32.690 --> 04:35.147
Plus, lwanna see if I can
get an earlier flight out to Oakland.

04:35.234 --> 04:37.976
I'll try. As of now,
Tim Brown is still set for 7:00 pm.

04:38.446 --> 04:40.778
and your urologist called
to conﬁrm for 4:30.

04:40.865 --> 04:42.571
Ah, fuck! I forgot to cancel that.

04:42.741 --> 04:44.527
Everything okay with your hard drive?

04:44.827 --> 04:46.363
Everything's fine with my hard drive.

04:46.454 --> 04:48.069
Don ’t put your health
on the back burner.

04:48.164 --> 04:49.745
I'm not. Thanks for your concern.

04:49.832 --> 04:50.867
Anything else?

04:50.958 --> 04:52.914
Yeah, a Ms. Brewer
from the league office

04:53.002 --> 04:54.458
called about meeting for drinks tonight.

04:54.545 --> 04:56.206
-Candace Brewer?
-So, you know her?

04:56.422 --> 04:58.583
Yeah, we go way back.
She say what it's about?

04:58.799 --> 05:00.414
Her assistant didn't give details.

05:00.509 --> 05:01.965
Before we agree, let's get some intel.

05:02.386 --> 05:03.466
You got it, boo-boo.

05:04.013 --> 05:05.093
I'm on it.

05:06.599 --> 05:08.555
Guy from High Powered is in from Denver.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.549
Reg and Vern are
insisting we meet with him.

05:10.644 --> 05:11.975
Can you handle that by yourself?

05:12.104 --> 05:13.935
You bet your big, fat hard drive.

05:18.360 --> 05:19.770
Why the fuck was he gambling?

05:20.654 --> 05:21.689
I don't know.

05:21.780 --> 05:23.236
Maybe he got caught up in the moment.

05:23.532 --> 05:24.817
Hey, what you doing still here?

05:25.075 --> 05:26.656
Last time I checked, this is my house.

05:27.203 --> 05:30.036
No, you got that thing with Amber
and the baby doctor today.

05:30.331 --> 05:31.366
That's tomorrow.

05:31.874 --> 05:33.284
It's in 20 minutes.

05:33.375 --> 05:34.501
I reminded you last night.

05:35.044 --> 05:36.659
Man, you better get your ass over there.

05:36.754 --> 05:38.415
There's no way I'm there that fast.

05:38.506 --> 05:39.621
She'll call when she get out.

05:39.715 --> 05:41.626
This ain't something you do
by the phone.

05:42.384 --> 05:43.965
We don't even know if she's pregnant.

05:44.053 --> 05:45.634
She did lie to him twice already.

05:45.888 --> 05:47.378
Man, look, that's all the more reason

05:47.473 --> 05:48.713
for you to go over there
and confirm for yourself.

05:48.807 --> 05:49.967
Man, I got too much shit to do.

05:50.059 --> 05:51.424
Man, what, you gonna head to Vegas

05:51.519 --> 05:53.601
and blow another
million dollars at the crap table?

05:53.771 --> 05:55.261
Man, you do need your head examined.

05:55.356 --> 05:57.017
If you'd have come
instead of sitting here

05:57.107 --> 06:00.099
passing judgment on everybody,
maybe you could've talked me out of it.

06:00.194 --> 06:02.059
Look, you know my knees
swell up when I fly.

06:02.154 --> 06:04.816
And when was the last time
anybody talked you out of anything?

06:04.907 --> 06:06.522
Don't blame me for your being an ass.

06:06.617 --> 06:08.482
What I do with my paper is my business.

06:08.577 --> 06:10.989
Well, somebody better figure out
something to do with that paper

06:11.080 --> 06:12.490
other than please themselves.

06:13.457 --> 06:15.197
-He's got a point, Rick.
-Hmm.

06:16.377 --> 06:17.412
Fuck you.

06:19.588 --> 06:21.795
Ricky, I'm not saying
you gotta wife her up.

06:22.007 --> 06:24.544
All I'm saying is that girl is
going through something right now

06:24.760 --> 06:26.170
that is scaring the shit out of her,

06:26.262 --> 06:28.002
and that baby's gonna
soak up all the fear.

06:28.430 --> 06:29.465
Trust me on that.

06:38.566 --> 06:39.897
You need to switch to crack.

06:39.984 --> 06:41.645
You lucky I still got some in here.

06:51.287 --> 06:54.074
Hey, y'all,
l'mma holler at you over there.

06:54.999 --> 06:57.911
-Okay, so let's hear it, super agent.
-Hear what?

06:58.252 --> 07:00.243
How you plan to get me
the money I deserve.

07:00.337 --> 07:02.714
You said some things
that got you in trouble with your team.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.250
Come on, man, look,

07:04.341 --> 07:06.593
half the locker room talks
nigga this, faggot that,

07:06.677 --> 07:08.213
and that's excused by the brass.

07:08.596 --> 07:11.383
The minute I mention Pep getting fired
or Lucas hating on Muslims,

07:11.473 --> 07:12.679
now I'm the angry fucking ape?

07:12.766 --> 07:14.722
You did mix it up with some of the guys.

07:14.893 --> 07:17.976
I don't take shit from nobody. Okay?

07:18.063 --> 07:20.770
Look, that don't give them the right
to dictate who I can roll with.

07:20.858 --> 07:23.725
When there's this much money at stake,
you know, sometimes...

07:26.238 --> 07:28.650
Makes sense to edit your social circle.

07:32.286 --> 07:33.321
All right, agreed.

07:34.163 --> 07:36.654
But that's why I told them I'd oblige
if they did the same thing.

07:37.082 --> 07:38.117
The same thing what?

07:38.208 --> 07:40.335
Stop donating to
all those right wing fucks

07:40.419 --> 07:42.159
denying my people equal opportunity.

07:42.254 --> 07:43.630
Fair enough. But, honestly,

07:43.714 --> 07:46.797
I don't care what you say or you do,
short of slapping nuns.

07:47.092 --> 07:49.583
I need to know that you're
being straight up with me.

07:49.678 --> 07:51.293
-I am.
-'Cause if I go to bat for you,

07:51.388 --> 07:53.174
I'm gonna need to know everything.

07:53.265 --> 07:54.880
-You got it all, okay?
-You sure?

07:55.142 --> 07:56.643
I promise you I didn't do shit.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.264
-Damnl
-Okay.

08:00.606 --> 08:02.346
-All right.
-Cannonbal|, baby!

08:04.276 --> 08:05.311
What the fuck?

08:11.992 --> 08:13.493
Yo, big Stink!

08:13.577 --> 08:15.033
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

08:15.120 --> 08:16.860
-Look at you.
-What's happening, brother?

08:16.955 --> 08:18.491
-You're looking good.
-Thank you.

08:18.582 --> 08:20.288
Yeah, you're killing it
out here in La La Land.

08:20.376 --> 08:22.207
Come on, now, you know
I don't watch musicals.

08:22.294 --> 08:24.876
Buddy, you look like
Ryan Gosling's ugly step-brother.

08:24.963 --> 08:26.794
Yeah, ugly and fat step-brother.

08:27.466 --> 08:29.252
So, tell me,

08:30.094 --> 08:31.550
what do you think about Vegas?

08:34.014 --> 08:35.299
It's hard to say, really.

08:35.391 --> 08:36.722
Yeah, I gotta tell you something,

08:36.809 --> 08:39.551
I'm surprised that Spanos
wants to split the fan base.

08:39.937 --> 08:41.928
The metro in Vegas is over two million,

08:42.398 --> 08:44.639
over 40 million people visit per year,

08:44.733 --> 08:46.815
spending over... Listen to this...

08:47.611 --> 08:49.567
$30 billion a year.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.399
Who are you? I don't even know you, man.

08:51.490 --> 08:52.605
You've done your homework.

08:52.700 --> 08:54.691
I'm one of the few guys
who waits till after college

08:54.785 --> 08:56.241
to become a goddamn bookworm.

08:56.495 --> 08:57.530
Come on.

09:04.336 --> 09:05.371
I'm here,

09:05.462 --> 09:08.295
so what are you hearing
from the worldwide leader?

09:08.507 --> 09:09.542
About what?

09:10.592 --> 09:11.672
About Vegas, Mark.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.045
Jesus. I flew all the way out here

09:13.137 --> 09:14.718
'cause you told me you'd
give me the inside shit.

09:14.805 --> 09:18.218
Spence, I'll be honest, I can't risk it.

09:18.767 --> 09:20.849
This TV gig, it's too important to me.

09:24.440 --> 09:26.226
Did they tell you not to talk to me?

09:26.692 --> 09:27.772
They did, didn't they?

09:27.860 --> 09:29.816
I got called into
the principal's office.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.564
-God damn, man!
-The network said,

09:31.655 --> 09:34.442
"You can't say anything
on or off the record."

09:34.742 --> 09:36.198
What about off-off the record?

09:36.702 --> 09:38.192
-Off-off the record?
-Yeah.

09:39.371 --> 09:40.747
I'd say watch your ass.

09:48.839 --> 09:50.579
We already own two grow houses

09:50.674 --> 09:53.040
-and nine dispensaries in Colorado.
-Shit.

09:53.135 --> 09:54.625
We invested early in Florida.

09:54.887 --> 09:56.423
Now that the laws are changed,

09:56.555 --> 09:58.136
we got a jump on the competition.

09:58.223 --> 10:00.805
Aiming to be the Starbucks of weed, boy.

10:00.893 --> 10:03.976
Well, unfortunately,
the league sees a big difference

10:04.146 --> 10:06.262
between sipping lattes
and getting baked.

10:06.440 --> 10:09.147
Most of what you see here
isn't even psychoactive.

10:09.234 --> 10:11.270
REGGIE: It's low-THC cannabis

10:11.361 --> 10:14.353
-prescribed for epilepsy and cancer.
-Wow.

10:14.573 --> 10:15.904
And with Vernon,

10:15.991 --> 10:19.404
what we plan to do is show how it works
for pain and injuries.

10:19.578 --> 10:21.443
Especially for the athletes

10:21.538 --> 10:23.403
who want an alternative
to the Percs and Vikes.

10:23.499 --> 10:24.955
You mean the legal medication?

10:25.793 --> 10:27.875
I mean the over-prescribed,
addictive pills

10:27.961 --> 10:30.213
that fuck up your head
and turn your guts inside out, man.

10:30.297 --> 10:31.537
That's exactly right, Reggie.

10:31.632 --> 10:35.750
And that's why we've created a line
of safe, side effect-free products.

10:35.844 --> 10:37.550
-Boom.
-I bet you did.

10:40.098 --> 10:43.261
Now, in the foyer here,
we have these oils and balms.

10:43.352 --> 10:44.762
They're low-THC, high-CBD,

10:44.853 --> 10:47.686
so they'll leave you thinking straight,
but feeling great.

10:47.773 --> 10:49.138
None of this gets you high?

10:49.399 --> 10:50.900
Not at the dosage we recommend.

10:51.193 --> 10:54.185
However, the law does allow us
to harvest a few full-strength varieties

10:54.279 --> 10:55.735
for the terminally ill.

10:55.906 --> 10:57.191
Make dying a little less shitty.

10:57.282 --> 10:59.694
That'll be the candies and chews.
Super yummy.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.366
AKA "the good shit."

11:01.453 --> 11:02.568
Relax, man.

11:03.789 --> 11:05.370
Ta-da!

11:05.541 --> 11:07.327
-Holy shit.
-Pretty good, right?

11:07.417 --> 11:08.918
This is what I'm talking about.

11:09.586 --> 11:11.417
Urn, Dave, can we get a sample?

11:11.505 --> 11:13.666
DAVE: Nobody's watching.
Sure, help yourself.

11:13.799 --> 11:15.460
| recommend the sour apple.

11:17.761 --> 11:19.046
No, dude, I'm on the clock.

11:20.055 --> 11:22.592
Man, how we know you cool
if you don't sample none of the goods?

11:22.683 --> 11:25.345
Because I'm a narc of all people?

11:25.435 --> 11:28.097
Fuck, okay. Yeah!

11:28.564 --> 11:30.020
-There, we're friends.
-All right.

11:30.190 --> 11:31.726
vamonos, mis amigos.

11:31.817 --> 11:33.603
-Let's go talk shop, yeah?
-All right.

11:33.694 --> 11:34.729
Okay.

11:38.907 --> 11:39.987
Shh!

11:48.792 --> 11:50.293
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

11:55.883 --> 11:56.918
The fuck am I doing?

11:59.803 --> 12:02.590
/ think as we begin
to take a closer look at player safety,

12:02.681 --> 12:04.592
there will have to be some rule changes.

12:04.683 --> 12:06.969
The players and fans say
that you’ve been ﬁrm but fair,

12:07.060 --> 12:09.312
but what happens when
you start penalizing these guys

12:09.396 --> 12:11.136
for the new contact violations?

12:11.231 --> 12:13.438
Well, there will be
an adjustment period for everyone.

12:13.525 --> 12:16.062
But this is what is best
for our players,

12:16.153 --> 12:18.895
for the fans,
and for the future of our game.

12:18.989 --> 12:21.651
-For the future of the game?
-The future outside of you.

12:23.911 --> 12:25.902
Seriously, Jay, you gotta
back me up on this, okay?

12:25.996 --> 12:27.611
When I am in beast mode,

12:27.706 --> 12:30.163
it is next to impossible
to pull up on a QB

12:30.250 --> 12:32.366
that I've been waiting
three quarters to hit.

12:32.461 --> 12:33.871
Not easy, but not impossible.

12:33.962 --> 12:35.873
She's quite the optimist.
Gotta give her that.

12:35.964 --> 12:39.798
Quite the optimist who's never put on
a pair of shoulder pads or a helmet,

12:40.552 --> 12:43.214
though I'm sure they would go beautiful
with your baby-blue suit.

12:43.722 --> 12:45.178
Sorry I didn't wear a hoodie.

12:45.390 --> 12:47.551
Spencerjust got
the first fine of the season.

12:47.643 --> 12:48.678
Good job, Spence.

12:58.487 --> 12:59.852
Boo-boo, what did you do?

12:59.947 --> 13:02.029
Virginia, that happened
over five years ago.

13:02.115 --> 13:05.983
The statute of limitation on insulting
a woman on live TV is death.

13:06.453 --> 13:10.162
It actually might chase you
into the afterlife if it exists.

13:10.374 --> 13:12.911
Fine, just set the drink meeting
with Candace, okay?

13:13.085 --> 13:15.918
Will do. And I'd call her
"Ms. Brewer" if I were you.

13:16.004 --> 13:17.084
All right, good point.

13:17.756 --> 13:19.747
Listen, l’m jumping on the jet now
to see Tim Brown.

13:19.841 --> 13:21.251
He just called and canceled.

13:22.094 --> 13:23.550
What the fuck? Did he say why?

13:23.637 --> 13:25.502
Just said sorry, something came up.

13:25.597 --> 13:27.929
-That's it?
-Unavail for the rest of the week.

13:28.517 --> 13:30.348
All right, I'm gonna make
his ass available.

13:30.435 --> 13:31.891
I'm heading up to Oakland now.

13:32.980 --> 13:34.095
I'll see you next week.

13:42.698 --> 13:44.188
Hey, here for Amber Kelley.

13:44.408 --> 13:45.443
Okay.

13:46.368 --> 13:47.653
She should be out shortly.

13:47.744 --> 13:48.779
-Short|y?
-Yeah.

13:48.870 --> 13:50.030
Great, l'll sit here.

13:50.497 --> 13:51.532
Wherever you like.

13:57.004 --> 13:58.540
Say, bro, somebody sitting here?

13:58.755 --> 13:59.790
All yours, man.

14:07.931 --> 14:09.011
You having a kid, too?

14:09.433 --> 14:12.470
Just here to support a lady friend.
She's in there finding out right now.

14:12.561 --> 14:14.176
Shit, lfeel you. Me, too, bro.

14:15.397 --> 14:18.264
Man, you know what?
This Zika virus is crazy, huh?

14:18.358 --> 14:20.565
Yeah, yeah, she's getting
tested for that, too.

14:22.029 --> 14:23.985
-Gotta take precautions, bro.
-Yes, you do, sir.

14:24.072 --> 14:25.278
-You feel me?
-| feel you.

14:25.365 --> 14:26.400
Yeah.

14:28.076 --> 14:29.111
Hey!

14:34.708 --> 14:36.619
Your next appointment's
confirmed, Amber.

14:36.710 --> 14:38.371
-Okay, thank you so much.
-Man, hey.

14:38.628 --> 14:39.663
Congratulations, man.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.336
I'm glad everything went well.

14:41.631 --> 14:42.962
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

14:43.300 --> 14:46.087
-All right.
-Ricky, you made it!

14:53.393 --> 14:56.055
We got Albert, Tunsil, Sutton,
Turner, James on the line.

14:56.897 --> 14:58.103
The question is the ends.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.931
Cameron or Sims? Stoneburner or Duarte?

15:02.235 --> 15:03.816
Something on your mind there, Charles?

15:05.363 --> 15:06.819
-Nothing.
-You seem distracted.

15:07.032 --> 15:08.238
Wife's on you about the hours?

15:08.325 --> 15:09.781
No, Iguess l'mjust
a little bit gun shy

15:09.868 --> 15:11.859
after I heard what you said
to Jay Glazer on TV.

15:11.953 --> 15:14.615
Aw, sometimes I gotta
put a spin on things

15:14.706 --> 15:16.321
to keep the media
and the fans on our side.

15:16.708 --> 15:19.120
Yeah, but you took sole credit
for Anthony Sutton.

15:19.711 --> 15:21.167
I'm the one who sent you down there,

15:21.254 --> 15:23.210
signed off on bringing him in
and training him up.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.709
Yeah, but I'm the one
who found him and trained him.

15:25.801 --> 15:28.713
Charles, if I give credit to each
individual contribution,

15:29.012 --> 15:30.923
l have to do the same for every mistake.

15:31.389 --> 15:32.595
What's the problem with that?

15:32.682 --> 15:34.843
It's a waste of time
and it breeds resentment.

15:35.560 --> 15:37.391
We have to put up a unified front now.

15:39.481 --> 15:41.392
But I still don't see
how that translates

15:41.483 --> 15:43.189
into taking credit for something
you didn't do.

15:43.276 --> 15:44.311
All right, Charles.

15:44.402 --> 15:48.270
Next time, I'll say
"one of my guys" or "we," okay?

15:48.865 --> 15:49.900
-Okay.
-Good,

15:49.991 --> 15:52.482
'cause we have to lock in a lineup,
and in order to do that,

15:52.577 --> 15:54.568
we need to get Coach Berg
on the same page.

15:54.955 --> 15:57.321
-You want me to invite him up?
-No, we need to go see him.

15:57.666 --> 15:59.281
And by we, I mean you.

16:01.128 --> 16:04.586
We both know 4.5 over three

16:04.673 --> 16:07.665
is an insult considering
his rank and record.

16:07.968 --> 16:10.050
Doesn't excuse his bad behavior.

16:10.220 --> 16:12.427
You can't punish the guy
for speaking his mind.

16:12.514 --> 16:15.756
Maybe not, but we sure as shit
aren't gonna reward criminal mischief.

16:15.976 --> 16:18.137
-That's ancient history.
-Ancient, my ass.

16:18.228 --> 16:19.968
He's under investigation
for drug trafficking.

16:20.063 --> 16:22.019
-What are you talking about?
-He didn’t tell you.

16:22.107 --> 16:24.598
He and his posse got caught
with a load of narcotics.

16:24.860 --> 16:27.272
Fortunately, it went down
in my hometown of Carmel

16:27.362 --> 16:29.193
and l was able to
impress upon the authorities

16:29.281 --> 16:31.567
the need to keep it quiet for now.

16:34.327 --> 16:35.942
I'll have a conversation with him.

16:46.089 --> 16:48.080
l was in your wedding party
and now you blow me off

16:48.175 --> 16:49.836
just so you could do biceps today?

16:49.926 --> 16:51.336
You really shouldn't be here, man.

16:51.428 --> 16:52.463
What the fuck's going on?

16:52.679 --> 16:54.795
The boss doesn't appreciate
you stirring things up.

16:54.890 --> 16:57.632
-l'm not stirring things up.
-We know you've been making inquiries.

16:57.726 --> 16:59.216
-Who told you that?
-l'm not saying.

17:01.313 --> 17:02.769
Tim, there's nothing unethical

17:02.856 --> 17:04.471
about me just getting
the lay of the land.

17:04.566 --> 17:07.023
We wanna stay under the radar,
not like the 49ers,

17:07.360 --> 17:09.191

of information they get.

stays in the building.

you're not the only game in town.

-Nobody.

I've failed already.

call those little motherfuckers.

Ow!

18:11.841 --> 18:14.378
That can't be good for the baby.

18:16.513 --> 18:17.923
Maybe it means she ain't pregnant.

18:21.059 --> 18:23.391
-You okay?
-You got something you wanna say to me?

18:23.645 --> 18:25.727
Yeah, maze! to you
and your giant, white boyfriend.

18:25.814 --> 18:28.430
You really think I would invite
a sidepiece to the doctor's office

18:28.525 --> 18:29.810
when I knew you're supposed to be there?

18:29.901 --> 18:31.107
-He was backup.
-Whatever.

Sure he'll make a wonderful father.

-That is, if you even pregnant.
-Oh, I am.

18:34.489 --> 18:37.481
-And you are the father.
-You can't prove that till it's born.

18:37.701 --> 18:41.034
The doctor said the baby was conceived
six weeks and two days ago.

-Yes, thank you so much.

-He's really nice.
-Check the calendar.

I got no problem manning up.

had dinner, and then we hit the club.

Uh-oh.

19:34.758 --> 19:35.793
Right there.

19:37.844 --> 19:38.879
Yeah.

19:39.471 --> 19:41.302
You said leave through the front door?

19:41.389 --> 19:42.970
I can do that. I can definitely do that.

19:43.058 --> 19:45.640
Let me just go ahead and leave
through the front door right now.

19:45.727 --> 19:47.137

about my plans today?

-Pardon me?
-Did you tell anybody about my plans?

20:19.969 --> 20:21.550
Did you tell anybody where I was going?

Uh...

20:22.889 --> 20:25.881
I think not. No.

to give you a sense of what
he was thinking rostenNise.

22:04.324 --> 22:05.359
Do I look like I give a shit?

Yeah, Aiello's gonna be
starting at center.

-All this attention's gone to his head.

and he's dragging his feet.

Really?

You know what?
Let me have a talk with him.

22:33.686 --> 22:35.802
-I'Il make sure he steps up.
-Talk with him.

22:35.897 --> 22:38.434
Ain't gonna change a thing.
I already made up my mind.

22:40.276 --> 22:43.894
Hey, Coach, Mr. Siefert ain't
gonna be happy about that.

22:44.656 --> 22:46.817
Once again, Charles, no shits given.

22:46.908 --> 22:49.149
You gotta at least
give it some consideration.

22:49.244 --> 22:52.532
-He is the GM.
-Charles, you're a smart man.

22:52.872 --> 22:56.239
Attaching yourself to Siefert
is not the move a smart man makes.

22:56.334 --> 22:58.996

-Rico, I saw it.

22:59.087 --> 23:00.827

didn't you?

-Yes, sir.

23:03.049 --> 23:04.289
Well, then fucking do it again!

23:05.677 --> 23:06.917
So, how'd it go with Indy?

23:07.679 --> 23:09.795
-Well, not like I planned.
-No?

23:10.265 --> 23:12.005
You left out some critical details.

23:13.268 --> 23:14.599
-Like what?
-You know like...

23:15.311 --> 23:17.643
That smells amazing.

23:18.064 --> 23:21.147
-Thanks, honey.
-You know what.

23:21.234 --> 23:24.397
I told you that I needed the whole truth
and nothing but the truth,

23:24.487 --> 23:25.943
and you held back on me, all right?

23:26.030 --> 23:27.770
You can give it to me now or I walk.

23:30.493 --> 23:31.699

23:31.786 --> 23:33.822
All right, all right. Look, come here.

23:37.417 --> 23:40.750
Me and my homeboys used to kick it
at this club in Indianapolis, right?

23:40.920 --> 23:43.081
And we met this Brazilian dude.

23:43.172 --> 23:47.006
He was known for hooking people up
with party favors and whatnot.

23:47.218 --> 23:48.333
And whatnot?

23:48.428 --> 23:51.591
No, man, like weed, blow,
pills, shit like that.

23:51.681 --> 23:53.421
-Party favors.
-He offered one of my homies

23:53.516 --> 23:54.551
a deal on some Molly.

23:54.642 --> 23:56.849
-And you didn't know about the deal?
-I ain't gonna say

23:56.936 --> 23:58.801
I wasn't aware that
he was gonna buy something,

23:58.896 --> 24:01.683
but, yo, I didn't even know he was
gonna deliver the shit to my house.

24:01.774 --> 24:03.184
-Come on.
-That was stupid.

24:03.276 --> 24:06.439
Especially 'cause the dealer dude,
he was trying to beat a case.

24:06.613 --> 24:08.444
So as soon as they dropped it,

24:09.157 --> 24:12.615
instantly, police just swoop in,
arrest everybody.

24:12.702 --> 24:14.909
-But you weren't at the house?
-They picked me up later.

24:14.996 --> 24:17.533
Said that I'd be in for trouble
down the line

24:17.624 --> 24:19.535
unless I turned on one of my homeboys.

24:20.043 --> 24:22.500
But, look, I didn't do shit.

24:22.670 --> 24:24.752
-That's the truth?
-The whole and nothing but.

24:24.839 --> 24:25.874
l'mma trust that.

24:26.507 --> 24:29.715
But if l'mma stick around,
I need to know that you trust me, too.

24:32.597 --> 24:34.428
-Okay.
-No, I mean for real, full on.

24:34.641 --> 24:36.302
-I will, I do.
-Okay, good.

24:36.809 --> 24:37.844
I clipped Indy.

24:39.562 --> 24:40.642
You told them I'm out?

24:40.730 --> 24:42.186
I told them to eat a bag of dicks.

24:42.273 --> 24:43.353
-Yo.
-Sorry.

24:43.441 --> 24:44.681
(QUIETLY) You said that shit?

24:45.234 --> 24:46.644
Yeah, I did, verbatim.

-It's good to see you.

25:05.922 --> 25:07.503
-You look great.
-Thank you. Nice suit.

25:07.590 --> 25:10.548
Thank you very much.
I traded in my hoodie for a tie.

25:10.968 --> 25:13.675

25:17.850 --> 25:20.466
-Your registration approval.
-Thank you very much.

25:20.853 --> 25:24.095
You gave a compelling performance
at the rookie symposium.

25:24.190 --> 25:25.521
I was just speaking from the heart.

25:25.608 --> 25:27.473
And your exploits
at the monster truck rally

25:27.568 --> 25:30.605
-were equally impressive.
-Yeah, well.

25:30.697 --> 25:33.109
You have a very unique way
of getting what you want.

25:34.283 --> 25:35.898
I take it you're not too keen on Vegas.

25:36.285 --> 25:39.413
The sex, drugs and gambling factor
is a bit tough to overcome,

25:39.497 --> 25:41.078
especially when it's out in the open.

25:41.165 --> 25:42.746
That makes it less of a draw, right?

25:42.834 --> 25:44.449
I mean, nobody wants what's easy to get.

25:44.627 --> 25:46.868
-You speak from experience.
-I've had my day.

25:46.963 --> 25:48.578
Mmm. Mm-hmm.

25:48.673 --> 25:49.788
I don't try to hide it.

25:49.882 --> 25:52.794
The truth is being in Vegas might even
bring you fewer arrests

25:52.885 --> 25:55.877
and less negative publicity
to tarnish the Shield.

25:56.139 --> 25:57.754
So you clearly understand the concerns.

25:57.849 --> 25:59.931
I take this business venture
very seriously.

a successful second career

26:08.526 --> 26:11.188
that is arguably better than your first.

26:12.321 --> 26:14.357
Why risk everything you've built?
