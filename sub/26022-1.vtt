00:46.797 --> 00:50.926
Salem Alcazar, the heir

00:50.926 --> 00:55.055
apparent to the free republic

00:55.055 --> 00:56.097
of Alcazar.

00:56.097 --> 00:57.641
Heir apparent?

00:57.641 --> 00:59.434
So much for the election process.

00:59.434 --> 01:01.102
Who said anything about an election?

01:01.102 --> 01:02.855
This guy's buying up ordnance to suppress

01:02.855 --> 01:05.858
the latest rebellion against his father.

01:05.858 --> 01:06.901
Dead or alive?

01:06.901 --> 01:08.402
Alive.

01:08.402 --> 01:10.571
The guy he's working for however...

01:10.571 --> 01:12.239
Victor Gobefren.

01:12.239 --> 01:13.365
You know him?

01:13.365 --> 01:14.533
He tried to hire me.

01:14.533 --> 01:15.826
Well fortunately for us,

01:15.826 --> 01:16.952
you've got integrity Grigori.

01:16.952 --> 01:18.203
Pay was terrible.

01:18.203 --> 01:19.329
Well it shouldn't have been.

01:19.329 --> 01:20.956
This guy's probably

01:20.956 --> 01:22.082
the biggest arms dealer in the world today.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.876
Besides Uncle Sam.

01:23.876 --> 01:25.544
I'll tell you what Val, while you're contemplating

01:25.544 --> 01:27.588
running for office, we're gonna kill Victor,

01:27.588 --> 01:29.548
grab Salem, and take home a healthy paycheck,

01:27.588 --> 01:29.548
all right guys?

01:29.548 --> 01:30.841
We're just...

01:30.841 --> 01:33.427
Were just gonna kill him?

01:33.427 --> 01:34.595
Not even talk to him?

01:34.595 --> 01:35.804
Ask him a few questions?

01:35.804 --> 01:37.890
Get his side of the story?

01:39.850 --> 01:40.809
Hey Dax.

01:40.809 --> 01:41.936
Yeah?

01:41.936 --> 01:43.562
Who's flying the plane?

01:43.562 --> 01:44.563
Right.

01:44.563 --> 01:45.773
Right.

01:51.194 --> 01:52.446
He's a liability.

01:52.446 --> 01:53.822
We're all a liability.

01:53.822 --> 01:55.074
He's a bloody time bomb.

01:55.074 --> 01:56.241
You wanna do what he does?

01:56.241 --> 01:57.826
No.

01:57.826 --> 01:58.994
I don't want anyone to do what he does.

01:58.994 --> 02:00.829
Yeah that's right.

02:00.829 --> 02:02.289
That's not the kind of world we live in Blackwood.

02:02.289 --> 02:03.457
Alright?

02:07.711 --> 02:11.506
All this used to belong to the KGB.

02:11.506 --> 02:14.217
Not bad for a poor boy from Ukraine, huh?

02:14.217 --> 02:16.053
A man in your position must have many enemies.

02:17.345 --> 02:19.222
I suppose I've made a few.

02:19.222 --> 02:20.766
You don't worry about living in such open space?

02:20.766 --> 02:23.560
We are in the heart of Moscow.

02:23.560 --> 02:26.647
What could I possibly have to worry about?

05:39.506 --> 05:41.633
No, I'm just pointing this gun at you by accident.

05:43.551 --> 05:44.845
Any problems?

05:45.804 --> 05:46.972
Nope!

05:46.972 --> 05:48.307
No?

05:48.307 --> 05:49.599
Dax killed the bloody Kaydrum.

05:50.725 --> 05:51.726
The Kaydrum?

05:51.726 --> 05:52.894
He was a spy.

05:52.894 --> 05:54.021
Who was he spying for?

05:54.021 --> 05:55.022
The Russians.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.523
The Russians.

05:56.523 --> 05:57.524
You have any idea where we are?

05:57.524 --> 05:58.608
Russia!

05:58.608 --> 05:59.651
Yeah, we're surrounded.

05:59.651 --> 06:00.652
Yeah.

06:00.652 --> 06:01.778
Do me a favor.

06:01.778 --> 06:02.946
Keep an eye on him.

06:02.946 --> 06:04.239
Tie him up, kill him.

06:04.239 --> 06:05.866
Wait!

06:05.866 --> 06:06.950
No, no, you already killed the Kaydrum.

06:06.950 --> 06:08.118
But--

06:08.118 --> 06:09.494
You know the deal Dax.

06:09.494 --> 06:10.704
Um...

06:12.289 --> 06:14.166
He could be my next employer.

06:14.166 --> 06:15.250
Integrity.

06:16.168 --> 06:17.376
Huh...

06:21.840 --> 06:23.550
To assure--

06:23.550 --> 06:24.843
You should have offered me more money last time.

06:29.348 --> 06:30.682
Wasn't expecting it this soon.

06:30.682 --> 06:32.017
We need a new exit strategy.

06:32.017 --> 06:33.392
Anyone?

06:33.392 --> 06:34.602
I'll give you anything.

06:36.771 --> 06:37.939
Catering truck?

06:40.817 --> 06:42.319
Anything.

07:07.677 --> 07:12.140
<i>♪ There ain't no good</i> <i>without evil ♪</i>

07:19.231 --> 07:23.693

08:22.585 --> 08:23.544
How you feeling?

08:23.544 --> 08:24.545
Oh thanks--

08:28.258 --> 08:29.592
You happy?

08:29.592 --> 08:30.593
What about Victor?

08:30.593 --> 08:32.179
Oh, he's dead.

08:34.389 --> 08:35.765
Pay the man.

08:41.770 --> 08:43.523
That was festive.

08:46.485 --> 08:48.362
Well I must say,

08:48.362 --> 08:51.281
it's a pleasure doing business with the both of you two.

08:51.281 --> 08:52.532
You have an interesting definition of pleasure,

08:52.532 --> 08:53.700
Mister Rekker.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.785
As do you, Mister Smith.

08:55.785 --> 08:58.621
I don't think she likes you very much.

08:58.621 --> 08:59.789
You can't be serious.

09:04.461 --> 09:08.131
Please, let me go. Please, I beg you.

09:12.552 --> 09:13.761
Hello?

09:25.232 --> 09:27.275
Is there something on your mind Agent Hayes?

09:27.275 --> 09:28.943
I don't see why we're paying that traitor

09:28.943 --> 09:30.778
to do our dirty work.

09:30.778 --> 09:32.780
That's because you spend too much time in the field

09:32.780 --> 09:35.283
and not enough in the capitol.

09:35.283 --> 09:37.327
Plausible deniability.

09:40.539 --> 09:43.083
Kidnapping the son of a supposed ally in the heart of Moscow

09:43.083 --> 09:46.503
is not something we can afford to have our fingerprints on.

09:46.503 --> 09:48.088
What if he was captured?

09:48.088 --> 09:50.048
Well if the Russians had captured Rekker,

09:50.048 --> 09:51.425
they would think they were doing us a favor, right?

09:51.425 --> 09:53.093
I would agree with that.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.303
So would half the pentagon, that's the point.

09:55.303 --> 09:56.971
So now that we got what we wanted

09:56.971 --> 09:58.932
what keeps them from selling us out?

09:58.932 --> 10:00.600
More money.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.809
And what happens when someone comes along

10:01.809 --> 10:03.520
with a better offer?

10:03.520 --> 10:06.022
Then we make sure that someone works for us.

10:07.399 --> 10:10.485
Somehow that doesn't make me feel any better.

10:13.530 --> 10:14.739
It should.

11:21.889 --> 11:23.558
Vincent Rekker.

11:23.558 --> 11:24.934
Do I know you?

11:26.227 --> 11:27.437
Carl Kess.

11:30.064 --> 11:31.065
The arms dealer?

11:31.065 --> 11:32.733
I prefer diplomat.

11:34.319 --> 11:35.903
I'm sure a lot of people would disagree.

11:35.903 --> 11:37.656
Yeah, a lot of people are naive.

11:41.576 --> 11:42.952
What do you want?

11:42.952 --> 11:44.703
To make a lot of money.

11:44.703 --> 11:47.040
I'm hoping you'll help me finish what you started.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.167
I don't know what you're talking about.

11:50.126 --> 11:51.752
Rare Earth elements.

11:59.802 --> 12:01.680
Pardon me?

12:01.680 --> 12:03.764
There's only two countries with concentrated deposits.

12:03.764 --> 12:06.934
One's China, you wanna guess who the other one is?

12:08.269 --> 12:10.021
The Republic of Alcazar.

12:11.814 --> 12:13.024
Never heard of them.

12:13.024 --> 12:14.942
Right.

12:14.942 --> 12:17.028
The United States can't be seen in support of a dictator

12:17.028 --> 12:18.946
that routinely uses genocide

12:18.946 --> 12:20.907
as a means of holding onto power

12:20.907 --> 12:24.035
but it can't afford to alienate the only non-Chinese

12:24.035 --> 12:27.288
source of material its economy is so dependent on.

12:27.288 --> 12:30.375
So this guy loses his son in Moscow,

12:30.375 --> 12:33.253
blames the Russians,

12:33.253 --> 12:34.753
and then his army doesn't get the weapons it needs

12:34.753 --> 12:35.838
to suppress the local rebellion. That's nice Miser Kess.

12:36.923 --> 12:38.675
Well played out. Yeah, unless the

12:38.675 --> 12:40.427
rebellion fails, then what?

12:40.427 --> 12:42.470
That'd be a shame, but it's none of my business.

12:42.470 --> 12:44.931
The moment when you put a bullet in Victor Gobefren's head

12:44.931 --> 12:46.807
it became your business.

12:48.560 --> 12:52.355
Like I said, I don't know what you're talking about.

12:52.355 --> 12:55.024
There's an abandoned power plant filled with ordnance,

12:55.024 --> 12:58.027
that was destined for Alcazar regime,

12:58.027 --> 12:59.613
but our mutual acquaintances

12:59.613 --> 13:01.531
would like it to go to the other side.

13:01.531 --> 13:02.616
I'm not a gun runner.

13:02.616 --> 13:04.117
Well, but I am,

13:04.117 --> 13:06.035
and all I need are the guns to run.

13:06.035 --> 13:07.995
No, what you need is for someone to go get them for you.

13:07.995 --> 13:11.082
Look, if I don't sell those guns to the rebels,

13:11.082 --> 13:13.000
Gobefren's cronies are gonna grow a pair

13:13.000 --> 13:15.670
and hold firm on the original deal.

13:15.670 --> 13:18.632
Either way, a lot of innocent people are gonna die.

13:18.632 --> 13:20.049
True, but one way is a fight,

13:20.049 --> 13:22.260
the other way is a slaughter.

13:26.180 --> 13:28.057
Look, I've done some digging.

13:28.057 --> 13:30.560
Despite your less than sterling reputation

13:30.560 --> 13:32.771
you care about more than just money.

13:32.771 --> 13:35.898
Even if that were true, you don't.

13:35.898 --> 13:37.567
How do I know I can trust you?

13:37.567 --> 13:39.486
Yeah, selling someone else's guns to a group

13:39.486 --> 13:42.071
that's backed by an off the books credit line

13:42.071 --> 13:43.906
from the United States,

13:43.906 --> 13:46.075
that might be the sweetest deal I've ever made.

13:46.075 --> 13:48.620
Ever sweeter if you're dealing to both sides.

13:48.620 --> 13:50.246
But said creditors,

13:50.246 --> 13:51.456
they're sending along an observation group

13:51.456 --> 13:53.166
just to make sure

13:53.166 --> 13:55.460
that everything goes where it's supposed to go.

13:57.962 --> 14:01.257
Okay, I'll make a few calls, I'll verify some things.

14:01.257 --> 14:02.841
Fair enough.

14:02.841 --> 14:04.469
Maybe we'll talk terms tomorrow, okay?

14:04.469 --> 14:06.929
I was hoping you'd be leaving tomorrow.

14:06.929 --> 14:08.723
Leaving?

14:08.723 --> 14:09.932
Where to?

14:12.226 --> 14:13.436
Chernobyl.

14:15.814 --> 14:17.440
Chernobyl?

14:17.440 --> 14:18.857
Chernobyl?

14:18.857 --> 14:20.527
That's crazier than I am.

14:20.527 --> 14:21.986
Yep.

14:21.986 --> 14:23.738
What's Chernobyl?

14:23.738 --> 14:25.615
That's right, history wasn't your strong point,

14:25.615 --> 14:27.200
was it darling?

14:27.200 --> 14:28.201
Or reading. Or maths.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.578
Or thinking.

14:31.996 --> 14:34.415
Nuclear meltdown.

14:34.415 --> 14:36.459
It was a long time ago, so don't worry.

14:36.459 --> 14:38.085
It's the one place

14:38.085 --> 14:39.754
you can fill with enough illegal ordnance

14:39.754 --> 14:41.756
to supply an entire third world country

14:41.756 --> 14:44.342
and pretty much be guaranteed no one's gonna bother you.

14:44.342 --> 14:46.177
Yeah, that is until you grow an extra arm

14:46.177 --> 14:48.095
and a second asshole,

14:48.095 --> 14:50.056
then every circus in town comes knocking at your door.

14:51.391 --> 14:52.975
How long?

14:52.975 --> 14:55.061
Long enough to where getting in and out's

14:55.061 --> 14:56.937
not gonna be any worse than Dax working on his sun tan.

14:58.606 --> 15:00.191
So what's the catch?

15:00.191 --> 15:03.027
Who says there's a catch, Shiro?

15:03.027 --> 15:04.654
There's always a catch.

15:08.616 --> 15:10.869
CIA's bringing in an observation team

15:10.869 --> 15:12.453
to keep an eye on us,

15:12.453 --> 15:15.540
just in case anything goes missing.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.166
They don't trust Kess

15:17.166 --> 15:18.793
and they don't trust us,

15:18.793 --> 15:21.880
and I sure as hell don't trust them.

15:26.967 --> 15:29.136
Well, that's bloody fantastic.

15:29.136 --> 15:31.055
So now we're babysitting?

15:31.055 --> 15:32.682
I like babies.

15:32.682 --> 15:34.267
Oh don't go there.

15:35.518 --> 15:36.936
-Seriously. -Guys!

15:44.778 --> 15:46.153
Bloody hell.

15:47.572 --> 15:49.407
As your captain,

15:49.407 --> 15:51.576
I advise you all to fasten your seat belts.

15:51.576 --> 15:54.036
This is gonna be one bumpy ride.

15:57.373 --> 15:58.416
You're not a captain.

15:58.416 --> 15:59.793
Oh yes I am.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.872
Why are we here?

16:37.872 --> 16:41.167
They have their own strip team.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.794
It's our plane.

16:44.545 --> 16:46.673
You know what I mean.

16:48.382 --> 16:50.885
Probably to kill us once we secure the ordnance.

16:50.885 --> 16:51.928
What?

16:51.928 --> 16:53.137
Why?

16:54.180 --> 16:56.015
To send a message to Kess.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.225
Patch things up with the Russians.

16:58.225 --> 17:01.479
Tie up loose ends in Alcazar.

17:01.479 --> 17:03.147
Plenty of reasons.

17:03.147 --> 17:05.817
You don't seem very concerned about this.

17:05.817 --> 17:07.609
It is what it is.

17:08.611 --> 17:10.696
We should tell Rekker.

17:11.948 --> 17:14.282
I'm sure he's already figured it out.

17:23.626 --> 17:26.420
The captain would like to have a word with you ma'am.

17:26.420 --> 17:27.547
Captain?

17:27.547 --> 17:29.298
He used to be a captain.

17:29.298 --> 17:30.884
Used to be?

17:30.884 --> 17:32.510
The guy who's flying the plane

17:32.510 --> 17:34.261
would like to have a word with you ma'am.

17:41.268 --> 17:42.937
Take a load off, we've got some time.

17:42.937 --> 17:44.480
Then why am I up here?

17:44.480 --> 17:47.316
Because I wanna discuss logistics.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.527
There nothing to discuss.

17:49.527 --> 17:51.529
She's got pretty eyes.

17:51.529 --> 17:52.822
You run your mission however you see fit.

17:52.822 --> 17:54.114
That's why you were hired.

17:54.114 --> 17:55.658
You've got pretty eyes too.

17:55.658 --> 17:57.577
Let me get this straight.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.453
You're gonna be standing right behind us, fully armed,

17:59.453 --> 18:01.748
while we're engaged in multiple fire fights, yeah?

18:01.748 --> 18:04.751
Every one of my men is an experienced combat veteran.

18:04.751 --> 18:08.004
You don't have to worry about friendly fire.

18:08.004 --> 18:10.715
Who said anything about it being friendly?

18:12.800 --> 18:14.468
What are you implying?

18:16.596 --> 18:18.305
I've done enough dirty work over the years

18:18.305 --> 18:21.392
to become a serious liability, I admit that.

18:21.392 --> 18:24.228
Plenty of my colleagues wanna see me dead

18:24.228 --> 18:27.607
and I got the strangest feeling that you wouldn't mind

18:27.607 --> 18:29.776
being first in line to pull the trigger.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.736
What possible reason do I have to think

18:31.736 --> 18:34.781
that there's not a target strapped to the back of my head?

18:34.781 --> 18:36.532
Securing a politically stable Alcazar

18:36.532 --> 18:39.201
outweighs anything you or I mean to them.

18:39.201 --> 18:41.120
They only want my men and me alive

18:41.120 --> 18:43.163
because we're taking those guns straight into the war zone

18:43.163 --> 18:44.415
and fighting with the rebels.

18:44.415 --> 18:46.000
And after you get them?

18:46.000 --> 18:47.710
You think we'll try to take you out?

18:47.710 --> 18:49.545
I think there's a high probability

18:49.545 --> 18:51.589
I eat a bullet when the dust settles, so yeah.

18:51.589 --> 18:55.134
I'd like nothing more than to feed it to you myself,

18:55.134 --> 18:56.761
but if you're half as good as they say you are

18:56.761 --> 18:58.429
it simply won't be worth the price.

18:58.429 --> 19:01.015
Right, I'm glad we're clear on one thing.

19:01.015 --> 19:02.433
We're clear.

19:03.434 --> 19:04.644
Hey.

19:05.853 --> 19:07.772
Let me ask you a question.

19:13.945 --> 19:16.238
Why is it you hate me so much?

19:18.074 --> 19:19.867
Because you betrayed your country.

19:21.911 --> 19:23.997
They betrayed me first.

19:47.061 --> 19:48.062
What's in there?

19:48.062 --> 19:49.605
Shit.

19:49.605 --> 19:50.648
Shit?

19:50.648 --> 19:52.441
Yeah.

19:52.441 --> 19:53.567
Burn reactor shit?

19:53.567 --> 19:54.568
Yeah.

19:54.568 --> 19:55.653
Ooh.

19:58.238 --> 20:00.574
You're probably gonna grow an eye there now.

20:00.574 --> 20:02.160
That'll be good.

20:02.160 --> 20:03.953
I need another one to keep one on you.

20:49.207 --> 20:51.000
It's a little too quiet.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.210
Val.

20:54.670 --> 20:56.672
See if you can get eyes on anything.

21:14.774 --> 21:15.942
Nothing.

21:19.361 --> 21:20.571
Head on in.

21:20.571 --> 21:22.115
Don't engage.

21:22.115 --> 21:24.700
Just give me numbers and positions.

21:28.955 --> 21:31.874
You're sending him in alone?

21:31.874 --> 21:34.334
It works better that way. What if he's spotted?

21:34.334 --> 21:37.171
If they spot Shiro we're dead before we get started.

21:43.219 --> 21:45.930
Isn't it about time we got this show on the road?

21:45.930 --> 21:48.432
I didn't realize you were in such a hurry general.

21:48.432 --> 21:50.184
Let's just say I've been waiting for this

21:50.184 --> 21:52.645
for a very long time.

21:52.645 --> 21:54.230
So it's not strictly business?

21:54.230 --> 21:56.816
Bloodshed is never strictly business.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.025
I beg to differ.

21:58.025 --> 21:59.526
Of course you do.

21:59.526 --> 22:00.945
That's what's the matter with men like you.

22:00.945 --> 22:01.904
General...

22:01.904 --> 22:03.739
It's okay.

22:03.739 --> 22:05.449
You know, everyone who comes knocking at my door

22:05.449 --> 22:07.827
has a speech about God and country.

22:07.827 --> 22:10.204
It makes them feel better about why they're there,

22:10.204 --> 22:13.666
and a big bag of money all the same.

22:13.666 --> 22:15.793
You know, you're no better than him?

22:17.962 --> 22:19.297
Never said I was.

22:20.380 --> 22:21.632
Send in the pilots kid.

22:21.632 --> 22:23.217
Let's get this show on the road.

22:28.388 --> 22:30.641
-Clear.

22:30.641 --> 22:33.311
At least for the first couple of buildings.

22:33.311 --> 22:35.521
You mean that Kess was wrong?

22:35.521 --> 22:37.439
This is an ambush.

22:37.439 --> 22:38.607
If it is, we'll be right here in the middle with you.

22:38.607 --> 22:40.193
It looks you will be

22:40.193 --> 22:41.443
because we're changing marching orders.

22:41.443 --> 22:43.361
You're coming with me

22:43.361 --> 22:44.571
and every one of your men is going with one of mine.

22:44.571 --> 22:45.656
We're going in together.

22:45.656 --> 22:46.991
That's not the deal.

22:46.991 --> 22:48.784
None of this is the deal.

22:48.784 --> 22:51.287
You want your guns, you gotta earn them.

22:51.287 --> 22:53.080
We go in together or you can go in alone

22:53.080 --> 22:54.957
and find a new ride home.

22:54.957 --> 22:56.250
He's right.

22:56.250 --> 22:57.918
It doesn't matter.

22:57.918 --> 22:59.795
It does if we wanna do what we came here to do.

22:59.795 --> 23:00.838
Let's go.

23:00.838 --> 23:02.380
Good.

23:02.380 --> 23:03.423
Pick a partner and watch your back.

23:03.423 --> 23:04.717
You and me.

23:04.717 --> 23:06.426
Who wants to be my bitch?

23:08.595 --> 23:10.931
Looks like it's you and me big boy.

23:10.931 --> 23:12.099
Oh shit.

24:23.087 --> 24:24.130
Right!

24:51.531 --> 24:52.783
Got it.

24:52.783 --> 24:54.910
Whatever the hell that was.

24:55.828 --> 24:56.787
You sure?

24:56.787 --> 24:58.247
I don't miss.

25:14.013 --> 25:15.513
Ron!

25:15.513 --> 25:18.017
Hey buddy, you'll get hit by him!

25:22.313 --> 25:23.521
Move!

25:45.211 --> 25:46.420
Go.

25:51.342 --> 25:52.550
Shit.

26:02.019 --> 26:03.396
God almighty.

26:09.193 --> 26:10.277
Give me your hand.

26:10.277 --> 26:11.362
Let's put him down.

26:11.362 --> 26:12.405
Here I've got you.

26:12.405 --> 26:13.447
Okay.

26:13.447 --> 26:14.990
-Okay. -Okay.

26:14.990 --> 26:16.116
-Nice and easy. -Okay I've got it.

26:16.116 --> 26:17.159
Got you.

26:18.077 --> 26:19.286
Get back.

26:19.286 --> 26:21.121
Okay, get this off him.

26:22.789 --> 26:25.792
Okay Val, get me an in and out of the perimeter ASAP.

26:25.792 --> 26:28.170
You shouldn't stare at things like that.

26:28.170 --> 26:31.589
You'll never get it out of your head.

26:35.010 --> 26:36.678
Keeping my observation team alive

26:36.678 --> 26:38.680
is part of this exercise.

26:38.680 --> 26:42.642
He paired his men with yours, clever.

26:42.642 --> 26:43.936
It's hostile territory.

26:43.936 --> 26:45.521
He was expecting an ambush.

26:45.521 --> 26:47.731
No he was expecting your men to betray him.

26:47.731 --> 26:48.899
He's cautious.

26:48.899 --> 26:50.484
Or he was tipped off. They don't know enough

26:50.484 --> 26:52.069
to tip him off.

26:52.069 --> 26:54.029
Most of them, anyway.

26:54.029 --> 26:55.072
If you think he can change the rules to get a better deal,

26:55.072 --> 26:56.656
forget it.

26:56.656 --> 26:58.367
If your people can't tell the difference

26:58.367 --> 26:59.993
between combatants and non combatants,

26:59.993 --> 27:01.579
then we should stick to what we've got.

27:01.579 --> 27:03.122
It's cheaper to drop bombs anyway.

27:03.122 --> 27:05.082
Let me tell you something.

27:05.082 --> 27:07.543
My people are capable of surgical precision, literally.

27:07.543 --> 27:10.379
Good, because I'd rather not lose any more of mine.

27:15.050 --> 27:16.676
Okay you're wearing your vest.

27:16.676 --> 27:18.011
Good man.

27:18.011 --> 27:20.013
What the hell hit me?

27:20.013 --> 27:21.599
Is it tank?

27:21.599 --> 27:23.016
Yeah, a tank.

27:23.934 --> 27:25.936
Rest up for a sec.

27:25.936 --> 27:28.314
Val, what the hell was it?

27:29.607 --> 27:31.609
That's the question.

27:31.609 --> 27:34.612
He's one of the guards that the kids told us about.

27:34.612 --> 27:35.946
Guards?

27:35.946 --> 27:38.115
I nailed it twice.

27:38.115 --> 27:39.741
He nailed with that thing.

27:39.741 --> 27:41.368
I don't care what they're wearing for armor.

27:41.368 --> 27:42.369
Nothing survives that.

27:42.369 --> 27:43.870
No kidding.

27:43.870 --> 27:45.080
Obviously there was more than one.

27:45.080 --> 27:47.458
No, not obviously.

27:47.458 --> 27:49.042
Only one line of gunfire.

27:49.042 --> 27:50.544
It swept left to right, changed positions,

27:50.544 --> 27:52.171
then swept right to left.

27:52.171 --> 27:53.797
If there were two more of those things up there

27:53.797 --> 27:56.049
we'd already be dead, all of us.

27:56.049 --> 27:57.635
How is that possible?

27:57.635 --> 27:59.386
How in the hell should I know?

27:59.386 --> 28:01.721
Let's not stick around here to find out.

28:01.721 --> 28:04.308
Big man, I'm gonna need you.

28:04.308 --> 28:06.684
Up, up.

28:07.894 --> 28:10.147
Good, okay.

28:10.147 --> 28:12.983
Listen up, I need more cover.

28:12.983 --> 28:14.568
I need more intel

28:14.568 --> 28:16.236
and I need to get a beat on whatever the hell

28:16.236 --> 28:17.946
that thing is that's trying to take us out.

28:18.989 --> 28:21.241
Wait, where's Shiro?

28:21.241 --> 28:23.410
Never can tell.

28:23.410 --> 28:24.662
This way.

29:56.878 --> 29:58.088
Blackwood. Okay.

30:02.050 --> 30:04.720
We breach, Grigori, you're gonna clear.

30:06.846 --> 30:07.847
Stay back. Dax?

30:08.848 --> 30:10.058
Yeah.

30:16.523 --> 30:18.942
Three, two, one.

30:50.056 --> 30:51.642
What is this place?

30:52.976 --> 30:54.436
Fuel depot?

30:54.436 --> 30:57.481
Oh, radioactive gasoline, great.

31:10.369 --> 31:12.579
What the hell is this?

31:21.921 --> 31:23.549
Down!

31:36.102 --> 31:37.896
He's tough.

32:01.503 --> 32:04.464
Why aren't you shooting at it?

32:04.464 --> 32:05.674
Shoot it?

32:05.674 --> 32:07.342
That thing's unstoppable!

32:07.342 --> 32:09.636
Especially when you're not shooting at it.

32:29.322 --> 32:30.532
Shit.

33:26.588 --> 33:28.340
Okay, you want some more?

33:30.342 --> 33:31.551
Okay.

33:44.439 --> 33:45.649
Run!

33:54.950 --> 33:56.994
Well played.

33:56.994 --> 33:59.120
I thought you said your drones were damn near unstoppable.

33:59.120 --> 34:00.372
I'm sorry general.

34:00.372 --> 34:01.790
Was one of them stopped?

34:01.790 --> 34:03.124
Definitely slowed down a little.

34:03.124 --> 34:05.002
A little bit,

34:05.002 --> 34:08.254
but they're up against the best of the best, aren't they?

34:08.254 --> 34:10.047
They can handle themselves in a firefight.

34:10.047 --> 34:11.632
I'll give them that.

34:11.632 --> 34:13.259
They also have numbers on their side,

34:13.259 --> 34:14.719
don't have to worry about friendlies,

34:14.719 --> 34:15.971
and they're still on the run.

34:17.304 --> 34:18.891
He does have a point general.

34:20.308 --> 34:22.936
Besides, we're just getting started here.

34:22.936 --> 34:24.187
Come on.

34:25.313 --> 34:27.565
Move, come on, run!

34:28.525 --> 34:29.568
Go!

34:29.568 --> 34:30.569
Move!

34:30.569 --> 34:31.695
Go!

35:04.853 --> 35:06.063
Go!

35:07.022 --> 35:08.523
Down the hall.

35:35.133 --> 35:36.217
Shh...

35:38.971 --> 35:39.972
What the hell are you doing?

35:39.972 --> 35:41.139
You tell me,

35:41.139 --> 35:42.849
because I'm pretty sure

35:42.849 --> 35:45.018
we're not recovering a rouge weapons shipment.

35:45.018 --> 35:46.561
Tell me.

35:46.561 --> 35:48.354
I don't know.

35:48.354 --> 35:49.815
That's a wrong answer.

35:52.400 --> 35:56.195
Rekker, please, I just saved your life.

35:56.195 --> 36:00.450
Which is the only reason you're still breathing.

36:00.450 --> 36:03.578
I know how this looks, but we're in this together.

36:03.578 --> 36:07.124
Tell me, why is it that thing goes after both of our men?

36:07.124 --> 36:08.708
Not mine, and mine alone.

36:08.708 --> 36:10.961
I've already lost men today.

36:10.961 --> 36:13.338
Who happened to be in the line of fire,

36:13.338 --> 36:17.759
a mistake those things did not make a second time.

36:21.387 --> 36:23.473
You're right.

36:23.473 --> 36:24.975
You were set up.

36:25.934 --> 36:27.226
But I was set up too.

36:27.226 --> 36:29.146
They told me the same thing.

36:29.146 --> 36:34.651
Alcazar, weapons retrieval, strictly observation, all of it.

36:34.651 --> 36:37.863
Strictly observation?

36:42.784 --> 36:44.494
So if you're not lying to me

36:44.494 --> 36:45.954
that means your hand must be lying to you.

36:45.954 --> 36:47.747
How do you know?

36:47.747 --> 36:49.708
Mission parameters.

36:49.708 --> 36:53.170
Yeah, you were sent to observe,

36:53.170 --> 36:55.421
to observe us getting fed to those...

36:57.465 --> 36:58.758
What are they?

36:59.634 --> 37:01.136
I don't know.

37:02.345 --> 37:03.889
Some kind of robot.

37:03.889 --> 37:05.431
Robots don't bleed.

37:07.600 --> 37:10.979
That's so the liquid doesn't look like blood.

37:10.979 --> 37:14.107
Too fluid, too organic.

37:14.107 --> 37:16.026
People can't survive a bullet to the head.

37:16.026 --> 37:17.986
I didn't say they were people.

37:17.986 --> 37:20.321
Looks like you've seen them up close and personal Shiro.

37:20.321 --> 37:21.948
Close enough.

37:21.948 --> 37:22.949
Where are the others?

37:22.949 --> 37:24.659
On the run.

37:24.659 --> 37:26.452
As far as I can tell there's only two of them.

37:26.452 --> 37:28.997
One of them's already heavily damaged.

37:28.997 --> 37:30.582
Well we should go after the other one.

37:30.582 --> 37:32.333
-Yeah.

37:32.333 --> 37:33.835
-Take it apart.

37:33.835 --> 37:35.378
See what they're made of.

37:35.378 --> 37:37.338
And find out what we're really up against.

37:39.799 --> 37:41.093
You coming?

37:44.221 --> 37:45.805
I'm gonna die.

38:13.416 --> 38:15.043
Why'd you stop?

38:15.043 --> 38:16.628
This is the perfect place for an ambush.

38:16.628 --> 38:18.463
Exactly, so we're gonna keep moving.

38:18.463 --> 38:21.007
No, no, we're gonna draw its attention first.

38:21.007 --> 38:23.135
What?

38:23.135 --> 38:24.261
Give me your gun.

38:24.261 --> 38:25.386
What?

38:25.386 --> 38:26.679
Your gun, mine's empty.

38:30.058 --> 38:31.601
Do you wanna get out of this alive or not?

38:37.440 --> 38:38.817
Thanks.

38:41.319 --> 38:44.281
That's great, keep yelling.

38:44.281 --> 38:46.324
Defector!

38:46.324 --> 38:47.993
Hey, that really hurts.

39:12.017 --> 39:14.644
Get off me you idiot, I'm an observer.

39:18.439 --> 39:21.067
There, he's in the shed!

39:22.568 --> 39:26.072
The shed, he's in the shed, there!

39:39.752 --> 39:40.962
Take this.

40:02.650 --> 40:05.486
Let's see how you like depleted uranium you son of a bitch.

40:10.658 --> 40:11.868
Sorry!

40:38.436 --> 40:40.272
That wasn't so bad.

40:46.819 --> 40:52.117
That was possibly the most ruthless thing I've ever seen.

40:52.117 --> 40:54.327
It was ruthless, reckless,

40:55.578 --> 40:56.704
pretty impressive.

40:57.622 --> 40:59.165
Surprised?

40:59.165 --> 41:00.750
Considering how often I've used them

41:00.750 --> 41:02.710
to tie up my loose ends, I shouldn't be.

41:04.421 --> 41:06.214
They always find a way though.

41:06.214 --> 41:09.968
But you're willing to sacrifice them now?

41:09.968 --> 41:11.594
So who's the ruthless one?

41:11.594 --> 41:13.012
Well if you tie up too many loose ends

41:13.012 --> 41:14.931
then you become one yourself,

41:14.931 --> 41:16.891
especially if you know where all the bodies are buried.

41:16.891 --> 41:18.893
I'll remember that next time we do business.

41:20.645 --> 41:22.230
If there is a next time.

41:23.940 --> 41:26.318
This isn't much of a sacrifice if they don't all go down.

41:26.318 --> 41:28.611
That drone was barely functioning.

41:28.611 --> 41:30.113
The next one will finish them

41:30.113 --> 41:31.697
as soon as it's done with Rekker.

41:31.697 --> 41:33.241
That's assuming Rekker's dumb enough

41:33.241 --> 41:34.451
to let himself be found.

41:34.451 --> 41:35.618
Rekker?

41:37.454 --> 41:38.704
He's dumb enough.

41:44.502 --> 41:47.380
Yeah, didn't think that was gonna work.

42:52.862 --> 42:54.113
You were saying?

42:54.113 --> 42:56.491
That clever bastard.

42:56.491 --> 42:57.575
He figured it out.

42:57.575 --> 42:58.743
Figured what out?

42:58.743 --> 43:00.370
The setup, us.

43:01.454 --> 43:03.039
She used herself as a shield

43:03.039 --> 43:04.416
because she knew it wouldn't shoot her.

43:04.416 --> 43:05.958
And, considering how much

43:05.958 --> 43:07.710
you wanna charge for those things,

43:07.710 --> 43:09.837
I pretty much expect them to work miracles.

43:09.837 --> 43:12.131
You know, miracles are overthrowing

43:09.837 --> 43:12.131
a hostile government

43:12.131 --> 43:13.674
with no American casualties,

43:13.674 --> 43:15.301
not sparing every civilian

43:15.301 --> 43:17.554
that throws himself in the line of fire.

43:17.554 --> 43:21.433
Fine, take her off the friendly list,

43:21.433 --> 43:23.017
but keep Barns.

43:23.017 --> 43:24.727
I need at least one on ground assessment

43:24.727 --> 43:26.229
before this thing is over.

43:26.229 --> 43:28.731
That's assuming he doesn't bleed out first.

43:42.537 --> 43:43.746
So...

43:46.207 --> 43:47.375
He shot him in the foot?

43:49.961 --> 43:52.422
It's not like he was any help,

43:52.422 --> 43:53.923
until he started screaming.

43:53.923 --> 43:55.592
Then at least he got its attention.

43:55.592 --> 43:56.801
In...

43:57.969 --> 43:59.762
Dax's defense,

44:01.222 --> 44:03.724
he seemed to be trying to identify himself

44:03.724 --> 44:06.269
and it pretty much ignored him after that.

44:08.771 --> 44:10.523
I was unarmed and injured

44:10.523 --> 44:11.816
while you people were shooting at it.

44:11.816 --> 44:13.359
Of course it ignored me.

44:13.359 --> 44:14.777
That was before we started shooting.

44:26.247 --> 44:28.749
You wanna tell me what the hell is going on here Barns?

44:29.875 --> 44:31.294
You're way out of line agent.

44:31.294 --> 44:33.212
I'm out of line

44:33.212 --> 44:35.465
We walked into the middle of a god damn blood bath

44:35.465 --> 44:37.634
and every single one of my men died because of it.

44:37.634 --> 44:39.927
That's on you, not me.

44:39.927 --> 44:42.013
You let him pair your people with his.

44:42.013 --> 44:44.641
I did what I had to do to accomplish the mission.

44:44.641 --> 44:47.726
Unfortunately, I didn't know what the real mission was.

44:47.726 --> 44:49.770
The question is, did you? Oh if you think I did,

44:49.770 --> 44:51.814
I could tell you?

44:51.814 --> 44:55.360
Or do clearance levels not even matter anymore, Agent Hayes?

44:55.360 --> 44:56.861
Between you, me, and this gun,

44:56.861 --> 44:59.113
very little matters anymore.

45:04.327 --> 45:06.871
Put the gun down.

45:13.127 --> 45:16.297
Come on. We're not gonna get any

45:13.127 --> 45:16.297
answers from a dead man.

45:16.297 --> 45:18.257
Come on, put it down.

45:21.969 --> 45:23.262
There you go.

45:24.639 --> 45:26.224
Good.

45:26.224 --> 45:27.850
But we can get answers

45:27.850 --> 45:29.477
from the remains of those things out there.

45:29.477 --> 45:31.646
Val, do me a favor and guard the door.

45:31.646 --> 45:33.147
On it.

45:34.691 --> 45:35.941
Dax?

45:35.941 --> 45:37.109
Yeah, no.

45:37.109 --> 45:38.194
Yes.

45:39.070 --> 45:40.946
-Rekker.

45:40.946 --> 45:42.657
We're out of time and we're out of options Blackwood.

45:42.657 --> 45:44.909
Dax, I need you to look after Agent Barns.

45:44.909 --> 45:46.661
What?

45:46.661 --> 45:48.496
You can't leave me in here with this psychopath.

45:48.496 --> 45:50.415
I can do whatever I want.

45:52.124 --> 45:53.834
I'm taking the guns for now.

45:56.462 --> 45:58.130
I need him alive, you got that?

45:58.130 --> 45:59.298
Yeah, yeah.

45:59.298 --> 46:00.799
Alive, I got it.

46:01.842 --> 46:03.094
Dax?

46:05.179 --> 46:06.972
Good, let's go.

46:21.237 --> 46:23.656
I swear to god.

46:23.656 --> 46:27.368
Oh, are you a religious man, Agent Barns?

46:33.374 --> 46:34.833
Does it even matter?

46:37.545 --> 46:38.713
I think it does.

46:39.922 --> 46:42.007
Lots of friendly people.

46:42.007 --> 46:44.761
You get to drink wine when you're underage,

46:44.761 --> 46:47.012
even if the priest sometimes...

46:49.348 --> 46:50.725
Do bad things.

46:54.853 --> 46:56.105
But that's enough about me.

46:58.775 --> 47:00.735
Let's talk about you for a little while.

47:09.535 --> 47:10.995
For keeping me from killing him.

47:10.995 --> 47:13.038
Doesn't mean he's not gonna die.

47:25.301 --> 47:26.843
Hey, you okay?

47:28.304 --> 47:29.681
Just give me a minute.

47:31.974 --> 47:33.392
Is he always like this?

47:34.310 --> 47:36.020
More or less,

47:36.020 --> 47:38.022
but he is trying to save our lives.

47:38.022 --> 47:40.483
I thought he was pretty much the devil incarnate.

47:40.483 --> 47:42.694
Until you walk a mile in his shoes.

47:44.111 --> 47:46.489
Afghanistan, don't you know the story?

47:46.489 --> 47:48.574
He lost a bunch of men in a botched raid

47:48.574 --> 47:50.409
and then killed his commanding officer to cover it up.

47:50.409 --> 47:53.412
I meant the real story, not the official one.

47:53.412 --> 47:55.080
There's an unofficial one?

47:56.791 --> 47:59.711
His unit was sold out for political capitol.

47:59.711 --> 48:02.755
Some paper pushers up the line wanted more troops

48:02.755 --> 48:06.133
and they needed some spectacular failure

48:06.133 --> 48:08.761
with a bunch of casualties to justify it.

48:10.763 --> 48:12.473
When Rekker found out he went AWOL

48:12.473 --> 48:15.142
and he killed as many of them as he could find.

48:15.142 --> 48:17.102
How do you know?

48:17.102 --> 48:19.271
Because I helped him do it.

48:23.067 --> 48:25.778
I was in the unit assigned to run his backup for him.

48:31.576 --> 48:33.870
We should go.

48:33.870 --> 48:38.249
You don't wanna go in there, and neither do I.

48:40.543 --> 48:42.044
We need answers.

48:52.221 --> 48:53.972
We're gonna bring a few more online.

48:53.972 --> 48:55.224
Bring as many as you need.

48:55.224 --> 48:56.392
I just wanna see results. Get out of the way kid.

48:59.687 --> 49:01.439
I'm bringing them all out.

49:04.817 --> 49:07.445
All right.

49:07.445 --> 49:08.654
All of them.

49:30.175 --> 49:31.719
It stinks.

49:38.935 --> 49:40.144
You stink.

49:41.520 --> 49:44.398
I smell like a real man should smell.

49:44.398 --> 49:45.858
Pull back the skin real man.

50:04.961 --> 50:06.879
This is so sick.

50:06.879 --> 50:08.547
You're worse than Dax.

50:10.466 --> 50:11.717
It feels like muscle.

50:11.717 --> 50:13.928
Because it is, sort of.

50:14.846 --> 50:16.305
Synthetic muscle.

50:17.431 --> 50:19.391
It was big news a few years ago.

50:19.391 --> 50:23.103
Some company created biologically compatible tissue

50:23.103 --> 50:25.189
that responded to nerve and pulses.

50:25.189 --> 50:28.359
It was supposed to be the holy grail for wounded vets.

50:28.359 --> 50:31.821
Wow, Russia never had anything like this.

50:31.821 --> 50:34.030
Unfortunately, neither did America.

50:34.030 --> 50:35.950
The company that created this kind of disappeared

50:35.950 --> 50:38.118
and the news dried up.

50:38.118 --> 50:42.164
I just figured it was something that didn't

50:38.118 --> 50:42.164
work out, until now.

50:42.164 --> 50:45.209
Somebody seems to have found a more lucrative use for it.

50:45.209 --> 50:47.043
I'm not sure killing us is all that lucrative.

50:47.043 --> 50:49.296
Yeah, but watching us die might be.

50:52.842 --> 50:55.302
They say you were an arms dealer like Carl Kess.

50:55.302 --> 50:58.138
How would you demo your newest, most expensive product?

50:58.138 --> 50:59.598
Line of fire.

50:59.598 --> 51:00.766
Line?

51:00.766 --> 51:02.727
And tie up loose ends

51:02.727 --> 51:04.395
with the people you're trying to impress while you're at it.

51:04.395 --> 51:06.981
Huh, he set us up.

51:06.981 --> 51:08.273
No, not him.

51:08.273 --> 51:09.692
Everyone Shiro.

51:10.651 --> 51:12.945
Everyone set us up. What about the girl?

51:15.239 --> 51:16.532
Is she in on it?

51:18.450 --> 51:20.661
I don't think so, for what it's worth.

51:21.704 --> 51:24.206
All right guys, any idea?

51:24.206 --> 51:25.499
What are these things?

51:29.545 --> 51:31.338
I'll tell you what Grigori,

51:31.338 --> 51:33.089
I'm about to find out.

51:46.562 --> 51:50.357
I told you to keep him alive Dax.

51:50.357 --> 51:52.068
You tell me a lot of things.

51:52.068 --> 51:53.444
Yeah I do, but you never listen.

51:53.444 --> 51:54.737
I listen.

51:54.737 --> 51:57.073
I don't always do, but I listen.

51:58.950 --> 52:00.868
Did you learn anything?

52:00.868 --> 52:03.704
Plenty, I can tell you all about the girl he molested

52:03.704 --> 52:05.289
behind a tree in the 3rd grade.

52:05.289 --> 52:07.833
Anything about our current situation Dax?

52:07.833 --> 52:08.918
Oh, you mean the drones?

52:08.918 --> 52:10.628
Jesus Christ.

52:10.628 --> 52:12.379
Forget about the drones.

52:12.379 --> 52:14.882
What about the things that are trying to kill us?

52:14.882 --> 52:16.092
Yeah, the drones.

52:16.092 --> 52:17.217
That's what they're called.

52:17.217 --> 52:18.510
Oh.

52:20.096 --> 52:21.806
Well, what are they?

52:21.806 --> 52:23.682
Biosynthetic shock troops,

52:23.682 --> 52:25.017
genetically engineered tissue

52:25.017 --> 52:26.644
grown in a cybernetic skeleton.

52:26.644 --> 52:29.354
Kind of a combination of man and machine,

52:29.354 --> 52:31.107
but just the scary parts.

52:31.107 --> 52:33.233
Well that's horrifying.

52:33.233 --> 52:34.944
It is.

52:34.944 --> 52:36.528
It really is, and this a lot coming from me.

52:36.528 --> 52:37.947
The fact that they're called drones

52:37.947 --> 52:39.824
implies that there's a pilot.

52:39.824 --> 52:41.283
Sitting in a room somewhere, hopped up on caffeine,

52:41.283 --> 52:42.827
playing us like a video game.

52:42.827 --> 52:44.954
Well that's terrific.

52:44.954 --> 52:46.330
How many are there Dax?

52:46.330 --> 52:47.748
Agent Barnes didn't know,

52:47.748 --> 52:49.458
and believe me...

52:49.458 --> 52:50.626
I asked.

52:53.754 --> 52:57.215
-I believe him. -So do I.

52:57.215 --> 52:59.718
He seemed to think there was a hell of a

52:57.215 --> 52:59.718
lot more than two though.

52:59.718 --> 53:03.014
That means this little demonstration isn't over.

53:03.014 --> 53:07.601
If I had to take a guess I'd say not only is it not

53:03.014 --> 53:07.601
over, but all bets are off.

53:07.601 --> 53:10.395
The original plan was to see how well they

53:07.601 --> 53:10.395
function under pressure

53:10.395 --> 53:13.440
against experienced opponents.

53:13.440 --> 53:17.862
Now, we're a serious liability, Agent Hayes included.

53:17.862 --> 53:19.697
They needed us dead, and since there aren't any

53:19.697 --> 53:21.532
more friendlies in the mix

53:21.532 --> 53:23.951
they will not be pulling any more punches.

53:23.951 --> 53:26.286
Why don't we just make a run for the plane?

53:26.286 --> 53:27.830
Yeah, that's not a good idea.

53:27.830 --> 53:29.123
Why not?

53:29.123 --> 53:30.666
Because you put a bomb on it.

53:30.666 --> 53:32.292
Yeah, all that equipment you were carrying,

53:32.292 --> 53:34.252
or Barnes or whoever, it doesn't matter.

53:34.252 --> 53:36.172
The point is, if we try to disarm it, they'll know

53:36.172 --> 53:37.673
and they'll detonate it.

53:37.673 --> 53:39.299
Forget about the plane,

53:39.299 --> 53:40.718
just run for the nearest hooch.

53:40.718 --> 53:42.218
They thought of that too.

53:42.218 --> 53:43.512
Humans get tired.

53:43.512 --> 53:45.056
They need food, water, rest.

53:45.056 --> 53:47.766
Drones just swap pilots and keep on going.

53:47.766 --> 53:50.019
Plus they can see in the dark and have areal support.

53:50.019 --> 53:51.645
The only reason we're still alive

53:51.645 --> 53:54.732
is they can't see through walls, yet.

53:54.732 --> 53:56.358
They're working on this new form of sonar--

53:56.358 --> 53:57.985
Not important.

53:57.985 --> 53:59.277
Right.

53:59.277 --> 54:00.946
So what's the play?

54:00.946 --> 54:03.407
The only play we have Shiro, to fight.

54:03.407 --> 54:04.992
How do we fight those things?

54:04.992 --> 54:06.535
One at a time.

54:06.535 --> 54:08.495
You see, they don't know where we're at

54:08.495 --> 54:10.206
and they have a lot of ground to cover,

54:10.206 --> 54:11.540
which means they're gonna have to split up

54:11.540 --> 54:13.167
and search one by one.

54:13.167 --> 54:14.835
How the hell do you know?

54:14.835 --> 54:16.754
If you were piloting one of these things

54:16.754 --> 54:18.463
what's the worse that could happen?

54:18.463 --> 54:20.216
It gets destroyed.

54:20.216 --> 54:21.592
Right, then you just grab another bag of chips

54:21.592 --> 54:22.885
and you try again.

54:22.885 --> 54:25.763
No fear makes people stupid.

54:25.763 --> 54:28.432
Listen up, we hit them fast,

54:28.432 --> 54:31.643
we hit them hard, and we can take these things out.

54:31.643 --> 54:34.146
We'll need to stay on the move once the fighting starts.

54:34.146 --> 54:35.773
Every one of those things is gonna know

54:35.773 --> 54:37.482
exactly where we're at.

54:38.692 --> 54:40.611
Lock and load, clocks ticking.

54:40.611 --> 54:41.820
Nice work.

55:58.605 --> 56:00.065
You think he saw us?

56:00.983 --> 56:02.026
Nah.

56:02.026 --> 56:03.194
Really?

56:04.486 --> 56:05.696
Bloody hell!

56:55.495 --> 56:56.580
Nice shot.

56:57.539 --> 56:58.707
I know.

57:00.751 --> 57:02.086
Let's move.

57:14.932 --> 57:16.183
Now they know what they're up against.

57:16.183 --> 57:17.726
Doesn't matter.

57:17.726 --> 57:19.019
They'll still be overwhelmed.

57:19.019 --> 57:20.354
It's just a matter of time.

57:40.665 --> 57:41.666
You see them?

57:41.666 --> 57:42.834
Yeah.

57:42.834 --> 57:43.919
Good, do what you do.

57:43.919 --> 57:45.129
Yeah.

57:56.181 --> 57:57.391
Nice.

58:00.727 --> 58:02.980
Remind me to start carrying more of these.

58:02.980 --> 58:06.400
When we get through this Val, don't you worry, I will.

58:11.238 --> 58:12.572
Three teams.

58:12.572 --> 58:13.615
You sure we should split up?

58:13.615 --> 58:15.492
They're onto us.

58:15.492 --> 58:17.161
We need to change tactics to keep them off balance.

58:17.161 --> 58:18.870
You two with Grigori.

58:18.870 --> 58:20.538
You two, you're with me.

58:20.538 --> 58:21.832
Let's move!

58:21.832 --> 58:23.792
Watch your backs, let's go.

01:00:11.567 --> 01:00:14.486
I just love killing strong droids like you.

01:00:24.162 --> 01:00:26.039
Listen up.

01:00:26.039 --> 01:00:28.500
First pilot to make a kill gets an extra $100,000.

01:00:34.256 --> 01:00:35.632
Find another one?

01:00:38.927 --> 01:00:40.845
You jump next time.

01:00:40.845 --> 01:00:42.055
Nope.

01:00:50.939 --> 01:00:52.399
We don't have enough fire power

01:00:52.399 --> 01:00:53.858
to take out one of those things.

01:00:53.858 --> 01:00:55.277
Yes we do, just not on us.

01:00:56.361 --> 01:00:57.362
Fuel depot?

01:00:57.362 --> 01:00:59.448
Yeah.

01:00:59.448 --> 01:01:00.698
How much time do you need?

01:01:00.698 --> 01:01:01.699
How much can you give me?

01:01:01.699 --> 01:01:02.826
Not much.

01:02:13.355 --> 01:02:14.356
You okay?

01:02:14.356 --> 01:02:15.440
Been better.

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:16.483
You think it's down?

01:02:16.483 --> 01:02:17.693
Yeah.

01:02:18.610 --> 01:02:19.777
Maybe.

01:02:19.777 --> 01:02:21.488
Hell I don't know.

01:02:21.488 --> 01:02:22.656
Let's just get out of here, what do you say?

01:02:22.656 --> 01:02:23.865
Yeah.

01:02:25.158 --> 01:02:27.327
Actually I've changed my assessment.

01:02:27.327 --> 01:02:28.995
The drones are fine.

01:02:28.995 --> 01:02:31.039
It's your pilots that need work.

01:02:31.039 --> 01:02:34.000
They're not up to dealing with experienced field operatives.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.044
I couldn't agree with you more general,

01:02:37.003 --> 01:02:39.381
but field experience,

01:02:39.381 --> 01:02:42.634
that's another reason for this little demonstration.

01:02:42.634 --> 01:02:44.261
So your men get better on our nickel?

01:02:44.261 --> 01:02:46.012
They could be your men.

01:02:46.012 --> 01:02:47.138
Their services are for hire like everything else.

01:02:47.138 --> 01:02:48.432
Hire?

01:02:48.432 --> 01:02:49.558
Why the hell would I bother?

01:02:49.558 --> 01:02:51.226
They're quick learners.

01:02:51.226 --> 01:02:52.810
You better hope so, for all of our sakes.

01:02:52.810 --> 01:02:54.771
Don't worry, they'll run out of bullets

01:02:54.771 --> 01:02:56.565
before I run out of drones.

01:03:02.738 --> 01:03:03.905
We need to find a loner.

01:03:03.905 --> 01:03:05.574
I'm down to my last round.

01:03:10.454 --> 01:03:12.664
Hey, up there.

01:03:44.488 --> 01:03:45.697
Hey.

01:03:57.375 --> 01:03:59.210
What now?

01:03:59.210 --> 01:04:02.464
Whenever he's settled, I'm ready.

01:04:59.270 --> 01:05:00.480
Val!

01:07:05.730 --> 01:07:07.774
Get her out of here!

01:07:11.569 --> 01:07:12.696
Forget about me.

01:07:12.696 --> 01:07:13.947
Stay with Shiro.

01:07:13.947 --> 01:07:15.365
It's too late.

01:07:41.725 --> 01:07:43.560
They're gonna die in there.

01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:46.646
Probably, but there's nothing we can do about it.

01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:51.192
I can die with them.

01:07:51.192 --> 01:07:52.777
You do that, they win.

01:07:53.695 --> 01:07:55.279
Who's they?

01:07:55.279 --> 01:07:57.532
Kess, Smith.

01:07:57.532 --> 01:07:59.116
Everyone who sold us out.

01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:02.245
Don't let them get away with it.

01:08:03.955 --> 01:08:08.334
They already have, because I don't know how to beat them.

01:09:09.813 --> 01:09:12.064
What is this place?

01:09:12.064 --> 01:09:14.943
Some kind of pressure chamber.

01:09:16.402 --> 01:09:17.988
You think they'll make it through that door?

01:09:19.906 --> 01:09:21.741
Not before we run out of air.

01:09:23.451 --> 01:09:25.368
You should've stayed with Shiro.

01:09:25.368 --> 01:09:27.705
Nah, I'd have just been in the way.

01:09:29.582 --> 01:09:33.127
Besides, if anybody's gonna make it out of here alive

01:09:33.127 --> 01:09:34.462
it'll be him.

01:09:36.046 --> 01:09:40.301
And if anyone doesn't, it will be me.

01:09:42.929 --> 01:09:47.475
If anyone shouldn't, it would be me.

01:09:48.643 --> 01:09:49.602
Dax...

01:09:49.602 --> 01:09:51.187
No, it's true.

01:09:51.187 --> 01:09:54.524
I'm worse than those things out there

01:09:55.775 --> 01:09:58.194
and the sad part about it is,

01:09:58.194 --> 01:09:59.570
I know it too.

01:10:11.624 --> 01:10:15.670
Maybe, but I'm glad you're here with me.

01:10:54.542 --> 01:10:55.877
Didn't I tell you?

01:10:55.877 --> 01:10:57.294
Just a matter of time now.

01:10:57.294 --> 01:10:58.504
It's not over yet.

01:10:58.504 --> 01:11:00.381
It might as well be.

01:11:00.381 --> 01:11:01.883
Actually, how many drones has Rekker and his team

01:11:01.883 --> 01:11:03.093
cost you though?

01:11:03.093 --> 01:11:04.886
I prefer to think of it as

01:11:04.886 --> 01:11:06.637
how many drone pilots just had the best training

01:11:06.637 --> 01:11:07.847
money can buy?

01:11:37.835 --> 01:11:39.462
We've gotta do something.

01:11:39.462 --> 01:11:41.338
We can't fight them if we can't hurt them,

01:11:41.338 --> 01:11:43.382
and even if we could, there are too many now.

01:11:43.382 --> 01:11:45.551
They're too strong, too fast.

01:11:47.428 --> 01:11:48.721
Too fast?

01:11:48.721 --> 01:11:50.431
We can't even outrun them.

01:11:50.431 --> 01:11:52.433
Even for a satellite, really there's no lag.

01:11:52.433 --> 01:11:53.810
What?

01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:55.728
Areal drones.

01:11:55.728 --> 01:11:57.230
They can afford a second or two

01:11:57.230 --> 01:11:58.815
of lag time in between commands.

01:11:58.815 --> 01:12:00.858
Their targets don't change that quickly,

01:12:00.858 --> 01:12:02.735
but when engaged in hand to hand combat...

01:12:02.735 --> 01:12:04.862
Their pilot has to be nearby.

01:12:04.862 --> 01:12:06.739
Yeah. We need to get to

01:12:06.739 --> 01:12:08.616
the closest rooftop.

01:12:08.616 --> 01:12:10.326
Why?

01:12:10.326 --> 01:12:12.870
Because it's time to put an end to this thing.

01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:15.581
Hey, how fast can you run?

01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:17.708
Dammit!

01:13:16.726 --> 01:13:18.102
They're catching up.

01:13:19.312 --> 01:13:21.022
I have no idea.

01:13:21.022 --> 01:13:22.148
Buy me some time.

01:13:59.769 --> 01:14:01.520
This door isn't gonna hold!

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:02.563
I know!

01:14:02.563 --> 01:14:03.564
I know.

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:16.535
You can't make that shot!

01:14:17.954 --> 01:14:19.914
No one can make that shot.

01:14:19.914 --> 01:14:21.082
Rekker! Rekker!

01:14:24.835 --> 01:14:26.003
Rekker!

01:16:31.379 --> 01:16:33.089
What's going on?

01:17:07.582 --> 01:17:08.749
Rekker.

01:17:14.213 --> 01:17:15.923
What happened?

01:17:15.923 --> 01:17:17.841
Interrupted their signal.

01:17:17.841 --> 01:17:19.676
Lights are on but no one's home.

01:17:20.553 --> 01:17:21.720
So it's over?

01:17:22.638 --> 01:17:24.515
Oh hell no.

01:17:24.515 --> 01:17:26.601
I'm gonna have a little word with Kess,

01:17:27.726 --> 01:17:29.186
and whoever else is with him.

01:17:39.029 --> 01:17:40.948
No way.

01:17:40.948 --> 01:17:42.825
What in the hell just happened?

01:17:42.825 --> 01:17:43.909
He cut the feed.

01:17:43.909 --> 01:17:45.202
Well get it back on.

01:17:45.202 --> 01:17:46.870
I can't,

01:17:46.870 --> 01:17:48.705
not without putting another dish up there.

01:17:48.705 --> 01:17:49.957
I think it would be more prudent at this point

01:17:49.957 --> 01:17:51.208
to cut our losses.

01:17:51.208 --> 01:17:53.127
Are you suggesting we run?

01:17:53.127 --> 01:17:54.462
Are you suggesting we stay and wait for him to find us?

01:17:54.462 --> 01:17:55.963
I got a chopper waiting.

01:17:55.963 --> 01:17:57.507
You might wanna continue this debate on it.

01:17:57.507 --> 01:17:59.467
He'll come after us.

01:17:59.467 --> 01:18:01.469
Not if this entire complex is wired with enough C4

01:18:01.469 --> 01:18:03.179
to blow it back on the map.

01:18:05.181 --> 01:18:07.600
It won't detonate until we're safely out of range.

01:18:09.393 --> 01:18:10.686
But what about them?

01:18:12.355 --> 01:18:13.814
We train more.

01:18:13.814 --> 01:18:15.525
You're a cold blooded bastard.

01:18:15.525 --> 01:18:17.568
Hey, feel free to give up your seat

01:18:17.568 --> 01:18:19.445
if it will make you feel better about yourself general.

01:18:23.991 --> 01:18:25.868
What the hell?

01:18:25.868 --> 01:18:27.286
Hurry up! Why's it so quiet?

01:18:38.964 --> 01:18:40.257
I don't know.

01:18:41.842 --> 01:18:43.386
You think it's a trick?

01:18:45.304 --> 01:18:46.556
Probably.

01:18:49.475 --> 01:18:50.643
Maybe...

01:18:52.186 --> 01:18:53.979
Maybe we should fall for it.

01:18:55.398 --> 01:18:57.107
It would be faster that way.

01:18:58.984 --> 01:19:00.152
Yeah.

01:19:02.405 --> 01:19:04.823
I'd rather die on my feet.

01:19:05.949 --> 01:19:07.159
Okay.

01:19:43.738 --> 01:19:45.281
You guys okay?

01:19:46.490 --> 01:19:48.451
Not really.

01:19:48.451 --> 01:19:49.660
You?

01:19:52.747 --> 01:19:54.540
Oh yeah, bloody fantastic.

01:19:56.125 --> 01:19:57.167
What happened?

01:19:57.167 --> 01:19:59.002
Rekker, I think.

01:19:59.002 --> 01:20:00.755
I'll see what I can find for bandages.

01:20:00.755 --> 01:20:03.048
Okay.

01:20:03.048 --> 01:20:06.802
Find Rekker and make sure this nightmare is really over.

01:20:06.802 --> 01:20:08.638
I'll stay with her.

01:20:08.638 --> 01:20:10.306
Suit yourself.

01:20:10.306 --> 01:20:12.808
Probably lots of people to kill.

01:20:12.808 --> 01:20:14.644
I'll go with him.

01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:36.248
Rekker.

01:20:37.916 --> 01:20:40.085
General Callahan.

01:20:40.085 --> 01:20:41.545
I should've known your grubby little fingerprints

01:20:41.545 --> 01:20:43.088
were all over this.

01:20:43.088 --> 01:20:44.674
Where is Agent Hayes?

01:20:44.674 --> 01:20:46.717
Making sure no one fixes the data link

01:20:46.717 --> 01:20:49.386
to those little monstrosities you tried to feed us to.

01:20:49.386 --> 01:20:52.598
For the record, they don't actually eat.

01:20:52.598 --> 01:20:55.559
Just for the record, I don't actually give a damn.

01:20:55.559 --> 01:20:58.437
You know Rekker, that's what made you so good.

01:20:59.438 --> 01:21:00.648
Makes.

01:21:01.732 --> 01:21:03.066
That and the steady hand.

01:21:03.066 --> 01:21:04.276
Relax.

01:21:04.276 --> 01:21:06.195
I was surrendering.

01:21:06.195 --> 01:21:08.238
It's not hard to know which way the wind's blowing here.

01:21:08.238 --> 01:21:10.574
Or smell the subtle hint of bullshit that it's carrying.

01:21:10.574 --> 01:21:12.159
I didn't choose your team.

01:21:12.159 --> 01:21:13.786
But you didn't mind

01:21:13.786 --> 01:21:15.705
sending us to the slaughter, Mister Kess.

01:21:15.705 --> 01:21:18.874
Business is business, you know that as well as I do.

01:21:18.874 --> 01:21:20.376
Business is business.

01:21:21.377 --> 01:21:23.587
Ain't that right, general?

01:21:23.587 --> 01:21:27.842
This is the second time you've sent me and my men to die.

01:21:27.842 --> 01:21:31.220
And it won't be the last, not if I can help it.

01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:32.388
You can't!

01:21:40.270 --> 01:21:42.939
Well as much as I'd like to

01:21:42.939 --> 01:21:44.900
mourn the loss of a good general,

01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:47.110
it appears that he's taken your last bullet with him.

01:21:48.278 --> 01:21:49.488
True.

01:21:54.451 --> 01:21:55.994
But not my men.

01:21:55.994 --> 01:21:57.204
Not all of them.

01:22:02.877 --> 01:22:03.878
Grigori...

01:22:03.878 --> 01:22:05.504
I know, fell?

01:22:08.924 --> 01:22:10.718
Looking to vent a little pent up aggression.

01:22:10.718 --> 01:22:12.595
Excellent. So am I.

01:22:12.595 --> 01:22:14.304
Rekker, I think you and I

01:22:14.304 --> 01:22:15.890
can come to a more equitable agreement here.

01:22:15.890 --> 01:22:17.558
You see, it's the negotiation process

01:22:17.558 --> 01:22:19.518
that I'm looking forward to Mister Kess.

01:22:19.518 --> 01:22:21.061
Suit yourself.

01:22:22.354 --> 01:22:23.980
That's the problem with you mercs,

01:22:23.980 --> 01:22:25.608
you're always so full of yourselves.

01:23:34.593 --> 01:23:36.720
You still trying to surrender?

01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:38.388
It's an expensive gun.

01:23:38.388 --> 01:23:39.723
I don't wanna leave it just laying around.

01:23:39.723 --> 01:23:41.433
You know what I mean?

01:23:43.101 --> 01:23:45.354
You know what's more expensive?

01:23:45.354 --> 01:23:47.105
Life.

01:23:47.105 --> 01:23:50.901
If you kill me, you'll never stop Langley.

01:23:50.901 --> 01:23:53.069
You'll never stop Langley.

01:23:53.069 --> 01:23:54.154
You'll never stop--

01:23:54.154 --> 01:23:55.197
Talking?

01:23:55.197 --> 01:23:57.032
Oh wait, that's you.

01:23:58.742 --> 01:23:59.910
Was you.

01:24:07.376 --> 01:24:09.085
How much?

01:24:09.085 --> 01:24:10.295
10 million.

01:24:10.295 --> 01:24:11.338
10 million?

01:24:11.338 --> 01:24:12.464
No way.

01:24:12.464 --> 01:24:14.008
Okay, you make it 20.

01:24:14.008 --> 01:24:15.009
20 million dollars?

01:24:15.009 --> 01:24:16.218
U.S.

01:24:17.511 --> 01:24:19.013
You gonna let him live?

01:24:19.013 --> 01:24:20.389
If the price is right.

01:24:20.389 --> 01:24:22.224
Even after he set us up?

01:24:22.224 --> 01:24:24.643
He never really promised to be on our side though,

01:24:24.643 --> 01:24:26.436
which is why I'm willing to give him a chance

01:24:26.436 --> 01:24:29.105
to buy his way out of it for 20 million dollars.

01:24:29.105 --> 01:24:31.149
Rekker, I don't have that kind of money.

01:24:31.149 --> 01:24:33.777
You couldn't have built a drone for a single penny less.

01:24:33.777 --> 01:24:35.362
It was a lot more than one.

01:24:35.362 --> 01:24:38.448
Yeah but, other people paid for that.

01:24:38.448 --> 01:24:41.201
Other people that are now laying around here dead.

01:24:41.201 --> 01:24:43.453
Think you can skim a little off the top Kess?

01:24:43.453 --> 01:24:45.873
Being that true patriot that you are.

01:24:48.625 --> 01:24:49.919
15 million.

01:24:49.919 --> 01:24:51.086
18.

01:24:52.004 --> 01:24:53.088
16?

01:24:53.088 --> 01:24:54.757
Okay, back to 20.

01:24:56.425 --> 01:24:58.301
But I'm buying my life,

01:24:58.301 --> 01:25:00.012
before and after you get paid.

01:25:00.012 --> 01:25:01.847
Only if you don't come back.

01:25:03.724 --> 01:25:06.852
Listen, I think I just wanna be a gun runner.

01:25:06.852 --> 01:25:08.228
Good idea.

01:25:08.228 --> 01:25:09.980
Hell of a world we live in.

01:25:09.980 --> 01:25:11.899

01:25:13.358 --> 01:25:15.694
I'm keeping this.

01:25:15.694 --> 01:25:17.112
Hey but, my first wife gave me that.

01:25:17.112 --> 01:25:18.655
Come on, Rekker?

01:25:43.472 --> 01:25:44.681
You alive?

01:25:47.517 --> 01:25:50.062
You indestructible son of a bitch.

01:25:50.062 --> 01:25:51.105
You're alive?

01:25:59.029 --> 01:26:01.197
What did you save this time?

01:26:01.197 --> 01:26:02.491
The planet.

01:26:07.913 --> 01:26:09.915
I need a drink.

01:26:09.915 --> 01:26:11.583

I figured I'd give everybody some space.

01:27:43.675 --> 01:27:45.468
Yeah, I hear you.

01:27:52.726 --> 01:27:53.936
So...

01:27:55.062 --> 01:27:56.312
What's next?

01:27:57.814 --> 01:27:59.149
I don't know.

01:28:00.483 --> 01:28:02.652
Aside from trying to avoid prison?

01:28:04.404 --> 01:28:05.906
My life is over.

01:28:09.952 --> 01:28:11.995
You know, I used to think that once.

01:28:13.371 --> 01:28:14.581
Not anymore.

01:28:16.291 --> 01:28:17.960
What got you through it?

01:28:23.465 --> 01:28:24.674
This.

01:28:25.926 --> 01:28:27.136
The people.

01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:30.889
Not having to work for a chain in command anymore

01:28:30.889 --> 01:28:33.433
and just, waking up every morning,

01:28:33.433 --> 01:28:36.853
deciding for myself what's right and what's wrong.

01:28:36.853 --> 01:28:40.023
Just make me feel better about everything.

01:28:41.483 --> 01:28:43.777
I never even thought about that.

01:28:47.739 --> 01:28:49.324
Give it a shot.

01:28:53.912 --> 01:28:55.705
Is that an offer?

01:29:03.338 --> 01:29:06.716
Well I'd have to give that some thought captain.

01:29:06.716 --> 01:29:09.052
I was never really a captain.

01:29:15.142 --> 01:29:16.351
