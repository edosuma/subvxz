00:07.670 --> 00:09.740
Good morning, students!

00:09.770 --> 00:12.840
Welcome to another
fabulous day in chemistry.

00:12.870 --> 00:16.710
This year's Thomas Dolby
Science Fair Competition
is coming up.

00:16.740 --> 00:19.280
Let's go over the list
of banned materials:

00:19.310 --> 00:20.980
- Gasoline.
- Ohh...

00:21.010 --> 00:24.610
<i>That's right.</i>
<i>All you lab losers stand back</i>

00:24.640 --> 00:27.350
<i>'cause Zeke and I are gonna</i>
<i>take it again this year.</i>

00:28.410 --> 00:29.610
<i>Oh, I see.</i>

00:29.650 --> 00:32.210
<i>In your mind they're losers</i>
<i>and you're not.</i>

00:33.080 --> 00:34.610
<i>Go away, Alex!</i>

00:34.650 --> 00:37.010
<i>I hate it when you use magic</i>
<i>to listen to my thoughts.</i>

00:39.000 --> 00:45.074

00:47.550 --> 00:50.150
<i>Zeke</i>
<i>and Harper Beakerman.</i>

00:50.190 --> 00:52.350
<i>No.</i>

00:52.390 --> 00:55.950
<i>Zeke and Harper Finkle?</i>

00:55.990 --> 00:58.290
<i>All right.</i>

00:58.320 --> 01:02.160
<i>No. Zeke and Harper...</i>
<i>Beakle.</i>

01:02.190 --> 01:05.560
<i>Ugh! OK, our kids</i>
<i>don't need a last name.</i>

01:05.590 --> 01:09.590
<i>Hey, if you</i>
<i>combined your first names</i>
<i>it's almost Zipper.</i>

01:09.630 --> 01:13.360
<i>You know what? I'm gonna</i>
<i>take matters into my own</i>
<i>hands and help you out.</i>

01:13.400 --> 01:15.460
No!

01:20.670 --> 01:23.430
<i>Alex, stay out of this!</i>
<i>Please don't meddle.</i>

01:23.470 --> 01:25.870
<i>Fine! I won't.</i>

01:25.900 --> 01:27.100
<i>See you later.</i>

01:28.800 --> 01:30.940
<i>After all these years,</i>
<i>she still thinks</i>

01:30.970 --> 01:34.670
<i>I'm gonna do</i>
<i>what she asks.</i>

01:34.710 --> 01:37.410
<i>Well, let's see</i>
<i>how much work</i>
<i>I have to do on Zeke.</i>

01:38.780 --> 01:42.150
<i>So if our universe is</i>
<i>actually on a speck of dust,</i>

01:42.180 --> 01:45.880
<i>that speck of dust can be</i>
<i>on another speck of dust.</i>

01:45.910 --> 01:49.810
<i>And another, and another...</i>

01:49.850 --> 01:52.610
<i>This is gonna take</i>
<i>a lot of meddling.</i>

01:52.650 --> 01:53.850
Hello?

01:56.220 --> 01:57.550
Who's there?

02:53.060 --> 02:55.020
So what's even better
than a food pyramid?

02:55.060 --> 02:56.790
A pyramid made of food
that you can actually eat

02:56.830 --> 02:58.660
and get all your daily
nutrients out of.

02:58.690 --> 03:01.330
- Ohh! This is genius!
- Yeah.

03:01.360 --> 03:04.260
We're gonna turn
this science fair into
the science un-fair!

03:04.300 --> 03:05.900
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

03:12.740 --> 03:14.340
- Hey, Justin.
- Hey.

03:15.570 --> 03:17.870
I want you to dump Zeke
as your partner

03:17.900 --> 03:19.970
so that I can get him
to be partners with Harper.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.870
It'll be awesome.
They'll be forced to talk

03:21.910 --> 03:26.610
and be close and...
Oh, my gosh, they're
gonna be together forever!

03:26.640 --> 03:29.340
Zeke and I have always won
the science fair together.
Like, I don't...

03:30.480 --> 03:31.880
Although, you know,
I always have wanted

03:31.910 --> 03:33.880
to build a car engine
that runs on just water,

03:33.920 --> 03:35.450
but Zeke's too afraid.

03:35.480 --> 03:37.850
Well, engines
are loud and scary.

03:37.880 --> 03:40.150
No, he's afraid
of the water.

03:41.890 --> 03:44.420
OK, but how do I tell Zeke
without hurting his feelings?

03:44.460 --> 03:46.360
I mean, he...
his eyes will tear up

03:46.390 --> 03:49.030
if we get picked
for different
basketball teams in PE.

03:49.060 --> 03:52.460
And then he freaks out
because there's water
coming out of his eyes.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.860
It'll be fine.
I'll take care of it.

03:54.900 --> 03:57.300
Hmm.

03:58.700 --> 03:59.840
Uh...

04:01.240 --> 04:03.170
Hey, Zeke, um...

04:03.210 --> 04:04.640
Justin doesn't want
to hurt your feelings,

04:04.670 --> 04:08.110
so he asked me to ask you
if it was OK

04:08.140 --> 04:11.910
that he entered
this year's science fair alone.

04:13.580 --> 04:15.780
I knew it!

04:15.820 --> 04:19.050
I knew that water-powered motor
would someday come between us.

04:19.079 --> 04:20.850
Darn my fear of water!

04:23.860 --> 04:25.520
Right. Well...

04:25.560 --> 04:28.190
You know who might like
to be your partner

04:28.230 --> 04:30.560
for the science fair
if you asked?

04:30.590 --> 04:32.030
Harper.

04:32.060 --> 04:33.600
Harper?

04:33.630 --> 04:35.070
Yeah, I'm wanting
to talk to her,

04:35.100 --> 04:36.400
but every time
I build up the nerve

04:36.430 --> 04:38.400
she's by
the water fountain.

04:39.440 --> 04:41.210
Well, here, I'll hold this.

04:41.240 --> 04:42.740
You don't want to have this
while you're talking to her.

04:42.770 --> 04:44.140
Thanks.

04:45.940 --> 04:48.540
Oh, looks like
I got me some lunch.

04:59.850 --> 05:01.350
Aha!

05:04.220 --> 05:06.460
Goodbye,
old science partner.

05:06.490 --> 05:09.620
If that water-powered engine
doesn't make you happy,

05:09.660 --> 05:10.960
you know where I'll be:

05:10.990 --> 05:13.290
In the library,
reading comic books.

05:13.330 --> 05:15.260
But not <i>Aquaman,</i>
<i>that's for sure!</i>

05:19.100 --> 05:21.400
So, Justin, I hear you're
short a partner, huh?

05:21.430 --> 05:24.740
That's great 'cause
I have been waiting to win
a science fair trophy.

05:24.770 --> 05:26.370
I hope it's one of those
big silver cups

05:26.410 --> 05:30.070
so I can melt it down
and make a really heavy
skee-ball.

05:30.110 --> 05:32.480
- Max, that's ridiculous.
- Yeah?

05:32.510 --> 05:34.110
Let's see
how ridiculous it is

05:34.140 --> 05:35.780
when that thing busts through
the back of the machine

05:35.810 --> 05:37.780
and I win a million tickets.

05:38.910 --> 05:41.050
Hello, 2,000 spider rings.

05:45.250 --> 05:47.860
Alex, Alex, Alex,
Alex, Alex, Alex, Alex!

05:47.890 --> 05:51.230
Harper, Harper, Harper,
Harper, Harper, what?

05:51.260 --> 05:54.260
Zeke asked me
to be his partner
for the science fair.

05:54.300 --> 05:58.170
Shut up! Really?

05:58.200 --> 06:01.200
He's gonna come over
later so we can talk
about our project.

06:01.240 --> 06:04.670
I hope now you can see why
I didn't want you to meddle
in this relationship.

06:04.710 --> 06:07.740
Love that's meant to be
happens on its own.

06:07.780 --> 06:09.740
Oh! Definitely.

06:09.780 --> 06:11.280
I have learned a great lesson

06:11.310 --> 06:15.880
about how affairs of the heart
need no interference.

06:20.580 --> 06:23.850
<i>And the lesson is,</i>
<i>how to string a bunch</i>
<i>of words together</i>

06:23.890 --> 06:26.290
<i>so people don't know</i>
<i>what you're really up to.</i>

06:37.800 --> 06:41.330
Uh, hey, guys,
you ready for another
lunch pocket turnover?

06:41.360 --> 06:43.100
Oh, no, thanks, Mr. Russo.

06:43.130 --> 06:45.230
If I have another,
you're gonna have
to turn me over

06:45.270 --> 06:48.700
to a personal trainer.

06:51.140 --> 06:52.340
Ohh!

06:52.370 --> 06:55.340
Oh, Zeke,
you are so funny.

06:55.380 --> 06:56.710
I know!

06:58.050 --> 06:59.780
Dad, Dad!

06:59.820 --> 07:02.950
Someone help! Open up the door!
This thing's really heavy!

07:04.920 --> 07:06.390
Justin! What is that?

07:06.420 --> 07:08.690
It's an engine block for my
science fair competition,

07:08.720 --> 07:12.060
and it's really heavy,
and I go whichever way
it goes.

07:12.090 --> 07:14.630
- You have to help me out!
- Take it out on the terrace!

07:14.660 --> 07:16.860
That's where I'm trying
to go, but it's heavy!

07:16.900 --> 07:19.130
- Jerry, help him!
- OK.

07:27.570 --> 07:30.710
What, uh...?
Hey, you two.

07:30.740 --> 07:32.610
Look like you're working
on something over here.

07:32.640 --> 07:34.510
What's, uh...
what's going on?

07:34.540 --> 07:38.610
Well, we're combining
my love of sewing
and his love of robots

07:38.650 --> 07:41.150
to combine a fully-functional
robot seamstress.

07:41.180 --> 07:43.480
- Hmm.
- Meet Ms. Sew-boto Roboto.

07:43.520 --> 07:46.890
Oh, wow. It's gonna have
a twin diode capacitor
thermal drive?

07:46.920 --> 07:49.020
If you know it,
show it!

07:54.500 --> 07:58.160
They are actually building
a Sew-boto Roboto.

07:58.200 --> 08:01.030
If this thing's as cool
as its name I am in trouble.

08:01.070 --> 08:03.000
I gotta get to work!

08:03.040 --> 08:04.540
What?!

08:05.470 --> 08:08.170
Hey, Zeke,
I really like what...

08:08.210 --> 08:10.110
Harper...

08:12.250 --> 08:14.910
Harper,
working on a Ms. Sew

08:14.950 --> 08:18.180
"you know this
is lame-o-boto"

08:18.220 --> 08:20.520
does not sound like a date.

08:20.550 --> 08:22.320
It's Sew-boto Roboto,

08:22.350 --> 08:23.920
and you promised
not to meddle.

08:23.950 --> 08:26.050
Don't make me make you
re-promise not to meddle.

08:26.090 --> 08:28.660
- All right, shoes off.
Pinkie toe swear.
- No!

08:29.790 --> 08:31.730
This isn't
how it's supposed to be.

08:31.760 --> 08:35.190
You and Zeke should be out
on a romantic walk in the park,

08:35.230 --> 08:37.100
holding hands.

08:37.130 --> 08:41.130
And your heart beating
so hard that you're
worried he can hear it?

08:41.169 --> 08:43.870
And then he kisses you
on the cheek,

08:43.900 --> 08:45.870
slow and gently.

08:50.670 --> 08:52.410
It's gonna be awesome.

08:54.010 --> 08:55.750
Well, I guess
that would be nice,

08:55.780 --> 08:58.410
- but we just have
so much work to do...
- Zeke, get up! Come on.

08:58.450 --> 09:00.020
You're going on
a romantic walk in the park

09:00.050 --> 09:02.280
and then a slow gentle
kiss on the cheek.

09:02.320 --> 09:03.690
Go!

09:08.560 --> 09:10.360
Justin, can you hurry up and
finish with the hose already?

09:10.390 --> 09:11.890
I need it
for my science project.

09:11.930 --> 09:14.960
I'm taking all the stuff
that's brown and moist
from under my bed

09:15.000 --> 09:17.500
and mixing it together
to create life.

09:19.230 --> 09:20.300
What's the hose for?

09:21.500 --> 09:24.470
To get the water from
there into here, genius.

09:24.500 --> 09:28.170
OK, you can't
create life from old socks,

09:28.210 --> 09:30.910
egg shells,
pizza crusts, and...

09:30.940 --> 09:33.410
...Grandma's wig.

09:33.450 --> 09:35.010
Where's it say that?

09:35.050 --> 09:37.480
Creating life
is not that simple.

09:37.510 --> 09:41.280
- Where does it say that?
- You have no idea
what you're talking about.

09:41.320 --> 09:44.850
- Where does it say that?
- Wow. You have no idea...

09:45.750 --> 09:47.590
- Whaah!
- Alex, stop!

09:47.620 --> 09:48.660
What?

09:50.430 --> 09:52.830
Sorry. I had to stop
this nerd-on-weird violence.

09:56.860 --> 10:00.270
Ooh! And then we can program
Miss Sew-boto Roboto's voice

10:00.300 --> 10:03.600
to say cool things like,
"I am
Ms. Sew-boto Roboto.

10:03.640 --> 10:07.110
Stitch, mend, or sew,
I am always on the go."

10:07.140 --> 10:10.040
"I think
you are really cute."

10:12.610 --> 10:15.180
Robots don't have opinions.

10:16.550 --> 10:20.080
Well, heh, maybe it wasn't
a robot's opinion.

10:29.520 --> 10:30.990
Yeah, let's take
the stuff inside

10:31.030 --> 10:33.460
- and I'll just...
I'll just go inside...
- All right.

10:33.490 --> 10:35.130
OK, great.

10:42.900 --> 10:45.040
Harper,
what are you doing?

10:45.070 --> 10:47.100
I sent you guys out
on a romantic afternoon,

10:47.140 --> 10:49.040
and you come back
with robot parts?

10:49.070 --> 10:50.840
Yeah. Isn't it amazing?

10:50.870 --> 10:52.670
Things are going great
with me and Zeke.

10:52.710 --> 10:55.380
No! You're not doing the
romance thing right at all.

10:55.410 --> 10:57.510
Not doing it right?

10:57.550 --> 11:00.110
Let's see, your longest
time with a boyfriend
lasted two months,

11:00.150 --> 11:02.750
and that guy ended up
running into the woods
to live with other wolves.

11:04.020 --> 11:06.120
Don't get me started on
the mannequin, the gearhead,

11:06.150 --> 11:08.820
and that baseball player
with curly hair one day,
straight hair the next.

11:08.860 --> 11:10.620
Man, he couldn't make
a decision.

11:10.660 --> 11:13.420
Well, you wouldn't even
be with Zeke

11:13.460 --> 11:15.060
if I hadn't told Justin
to dump him

11:15.090 --> 11:17.230
and then ask Zeke
to be your partner.

11:18.660 --> 11:21.200
And right now,
I'm kind of hoping

11:21.230 --> 11:23.400
that you're trying to think of
other old boyfriends of mine

11:23.430 --> 11:25.900
so that you didn't hear
what I just said.

11:25.930 --> 11:28.700
Alex, I can't believe you broke
your promise not to meddle.

11:28.740 --> 11:30.470
Actually, I can believe
you broke your promise.

11:30.510 --> 11:32.940
What I can't believe is
that I believed you wouldn't
break your promise.

11:32.970 --> 11:35.410
Hey! Wait!
I'm storming inside.

11:35.440 --> 11:36.410
No.

11:36.440 --> 11:38.180
I'm storming inside.

11:38.210 --> 11:39.880
- Well, I live here.
- I do, too!

11:39.910 --> 11:40.950
Oh.

11:42.180 --> 11:44.580
- Same time, then.
- Fine!

11:49.420 --> 11:51.750
OK, when wizards need fire,

11:51.790 --> 11:53.520
they use
the Sparks Fly spell.

11:53.560 --> 11:55.690
There are no matches
in the wizard world

11:55.720 --> 11:58.890
because wizard sneezes
are flammable.

11:58.930 --> 12:00.960
Oh, right,
like my butt sneezes.

12:02.530 --> 12:06.930
Now,
wizards do need fire
for light,
heating, cooking.

12:06.970 --> 12:10.900
Wait a minute. Wizards can
pop in any meal they want,

12:10.940 --> 12:13.200
and they still have
to use fire to cook?

12:13.240 --> 12:14.700
What a waste.

12:14.740 --> 12:18.870
Um, Theresa, you're here
to observe the lesson

12:18.910 --> 12:21.040
so that you can better
appreciate magic.

12:21.080 --> 12:24.280
And your snide comments
don't sound like appreciation.

12:24.310 --> 12:26.780
They sound like... Alex.

12:28.380 --> 12:31.050
All right,
let's give it a try.
Max.

12:33.290 --> 12:35.020
Say this spell.

12:37.790 --> 12:40.690
Zippozap zippozee
zippozarum.

12:42.830 --> 12:45.230
Now, the most important
thing to remember

12:45.260 --> 12:48.570
is you can never use
this spell on people.

12:48.600 --> 12:50.770
Why not?
People love cake.

12:50.800 --> 12:54.570
It doesn't make cake.
You just... 

12:56.170 --> 12:57.770
If you use this spell
on people,

12:57.810 --> 12:59.310
it fires up their emotions,

12:59.340 --> 13:01.280
and you never know
what they'll do.

13:01.310 --> 13:03.440
Maybe they'll make cake.

13:05.780 --> 13:07.180
Sorry I'm late.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.320
I just got into a really
huge fight with Harper,

13:09.350 --> 13:12.150
and I need to talk it out,
so who's up?

13:16.930 --> 13:19.860
I would like to help,
but since you were late
to the lesson

13:19.900 --> 13:21.200
and Max was on time,

13:21.230 --> 13:24.270
I am gonna
reward him with cake.

13:28.340 --> 13:29.340
Come on.

13:29.370 --> 13:30.940
Alex, I took good notes.

13:30.970 --> 13:32.270
They're on
the hamburger wrapper.

13:32.310 --> 13:34.070
Don't read that stuff
about Mom and Dad arguing.

13:34.110 --> 13:35.670
I don't know what that was.

13:38.380 --> 13:40.150
So you had a fight
with Harper.

13:40.180 --> 13:42.680
Actually...

13:42.710 --> 13:44.410
...I was trying to be
a good friend

13:44.450 --> 13:46.210
and get her romance
going with Zeke,

13:46.250 --> 13:49.950
but all they want to do
is work on their stupid
science project.

13:49.990 --> 13:54.960
Alex, relationships
take their own roads
at their own speeds.

13:54.990 --> 13:57.620
All that matters is that
they're together.

13:57.660 --> 14:00.490
No! That is not
all that matters.

14:00.530 --> 14:03.730
They need to be doing
stuff, like trying to beat
each other at Skee-Ball

14:03.760 --> 14:06.560
or throwing water balloons
off the terrace.

14:06.600 --> 14:10.870
Or driving a racecar
into a giant sloppy joe.

14:10.900 --> 14:12.870
OK, <i>mija,</i>

14:12.900 --> 14:15.170
I think I see
what's going on.

14:15.210 --> 14:19.210
Your idea of romance
is different
from Harper's, right?

14:19.240 --> 14:21.640
And I think you may be
trying to

14:21.680 --> 14:25.050
relive your relationships
with your old boyfriends

14:25.080 --> 14:27.250
through Harper and Zeke.

14:27.280 --> 14:29.920
What?

14:29.950 --> 14:32.150
Mom, my old boyfriends
have nothing to do
with this.

14:32.190 --> 14:35.720
I don't even think
about them. I don't even
remember their names.

14:36.520 --> 14:38.220
Riley, Dean, and Mason.

14:38.260 --> 14:40.120
Mom, I asked you never
to say their names again.

14:41.560 --> 14:43.330
Look... 

14:43.360 --> 14:45.890
I'm just trying to be
a good friend to Harper.

14:45.930 --> 14:47.800
Stop meddling.

14:52.940 --> 14:54.940
<i>I'm not meddling!</i>

14:57.670 --> 14:59.610
<i>"Sparks fly."</i>

15:00.940 --> 15:03.080
<i>Huh. Sounds like something</i>

15:03.110 --> 15:06.280
<i>that can really turn up</i>
<i>the heat on a romance.</i>

15:07.110 --> 15:08.780
Now I'm meddling.

15:20.830 --> 15:22.230
Please.

15:23.100 --> 15:25.360
Come on, start!

15:25.400 --> 15:27.330
Start!

15:28.430 --> 15:30.870
Start!

15:35.170 --> 15:38.270
It worked!

15:38.310 --> 15:42.180
Hey, world, your energy
troubles are over!

15:42.210 --> 15:45.380
Great. I'll send you
my electric bill.

15:45.410 --> 15:47.550
Now shut up, Russo!

15:49.650 --> 15:51.320
Justin, you got it
running, huh?

15:51.350 --> 15:53.520
Very good, very good.

15:53.550 --> 15:57.060
But not good enough
to beat me in creating
life in this barbecue.

15:57.090 --> 15:59.460
The building blocks
of life, my friend.

16:00.790 --> 16:02.460
Burnt chicken skin.

16:02.490 --> 16:03.830
That's right.

16:03.860 --> 16:06.000
I'm bringing
this guy back to life.

16:14.400 --> 16:16.670
- Cool!
- Yes!

16:20.070 --> 16:21.910
- All right. Ready?
- Yeah. OK.

16:21.940 --> 16:23.240
OK.

16:36.760 --> 16:38.890
Stitch or sew,
even mend,

16:38.920 --> 16:40.620
I will be
your tailor friend.

16:40.660 --> 16:42.990
Quality is my motto.

16:43.030 --> 16:45.230
I am
Ms. Sew-boto Roboto.

16:46.400 --> 16:48.100
- Oh, yeah!
- Yes!

16:52.670 --> 16:55.510
- Oh, we are so gonna
win that trophy.
- Yeah.

16:59.040 --> 17:01.840
Harper, it's been
so great working with you

17:01.880 --> 17:04.040
that...
if it's OK with you,

17:04.079 --> 17:06.310
when this
whole thing's over...

17:06.349 --> 17:08.150
...we might take it
to the next level?

17:09.550 --> 17:11.420
- I was thinking
the same thing.
- Yeah?

17:13.050 --> 17:15.990
- Robot washing machine?
- Yes!

17:21.920 --> 17:25.060
OK, they definitely
need some sparks.

17:25.089 --> 17:28.089
Zippozap zippozee
zippozarum.

17:32.530 --> 17:34.070
Do you want to go for a walk?

17:34.100 --> 17:35.870
I don't care where,
as long as you're with me.

17:35.900 --> 17:37.500
That's where I want to be.

17:40.880 --> 17:42.210
- After you.
- Thanks.

17:43.550 --> 17:45.650
Now that's how you
spark up a romance.

17:45.680 --> 17:48.180
- Hey, Max.
- Hey.

17:48.220 --> 17:50.750
Thanks for letting me
use your notes
on the Sparks Fly spell.

17:50.790 --> 17:52.320
- I really put them
to good use.
- Yeah.

17:52.350 --> 17:54.890
Wait, there's
some warning Dad said.

17:54.920 --> 17:57.690
- I forgot to write it down.
- Max! What was it?

17:57.720 --> 17:59.760
Oh! I remember!

17:59.790 --> 18:01.760
He said never leave
any cake frosting around

18:01.800 --> 18:04.430
- because it might
attract ants.

18:04.460 --> 18:06.900
- Could've been disastrous.
- Yeah.

18:18.240 --> 18:19.840
- Hey.
- Yeah?

18:19.880 --> 18:21.880
That was a really
nice thing you did,

18:21.910 --> 18:23.950
letting Zeke work
with Harper.

18:23.980 --> 18:26.620
I mean, they are
in the carpool lane
of romance.

18:26.650 --> 18:30.550
I mean, I'm not even gonna
make fun of this huge hunk of
nerd you got going on here.

18:30.590 --> 18:33.020
This, this is a miracle.

18:33.060 --> 18:35.660
The world's first
water-powered engine.

18:35.690 --> 18:38.960
I'll probably go down in history
as the greatest inventor ever!

18:38.990 --> 18:42.600
- Oh, man!
- It was so funny.

18:44.200 --> 18:45.530
You've stolen my heart.

18:45.570 --> 18:47.200
Aww!

18:49.070 --> 18:51.600
- And you're my whole world.
- Oh, my goodness!

18:54.640 --> 18:57.140
- Oh, man. Ohh...
- Hey, guys.

18:57.180 --> 19:00.650
Looks like you're
still into each other.
No thanks necessary.

19:02.080 --> 19:05.580
Yeah. I think our relationship
is ready for something serious.

19:05.620 --> 19:07.350
Yes!

19:07.390 --> 19:09.550
We should totally
hold hands.

19:09.590 --> 19:11.020
- OK!
- OK.

19:12.020 --> 19:13.420
Ow!

19:14.560 --> 19:15.890
That was weird.

19:15.930 --> 19:17.490
Seems like something
we should ignore.

19:17.530 --> 19:18.830
How about you go
right for the hug?

19:24.770 --> 19:26.830
What is going on with you two?

19:26.870 --> 19:28.840
Here, let's just get to
the smoochin'. Come on.

19:28.870 --> 19:31.100
All right. I'm here!

19:32.340 --> 19:34.240
I hope I'm not too late.
I had a hard time

19:34.270 --> 19:36.210
getting my Barbecue
of Life on the subway.

19:40.150 --> 19:41.710
Whoa!

19:46.750 --> 19:48.450
Stand on a rooftop
and shout it!

19:48.490 --> 19:51.520
Max Russo has created life
in his primordial kettle!

19:51.560 --> 19:54.590
We have a winner!

19:57.590 --> 20:00.630
I can't get this thing off.
How am I supposed
to put stuff inside it?

20:00.660 --> 20:03.070
All right, who wants it?

20:04.270 --> 20:05.630
I won!

20:05.670 --> 20:07.700
Yes! Thank you!

20:07.740 --> 20:09.800
Thank you, all of you!

20:09.840 --> 20:11.610
Justin, Justin...

20:11.640 --> 20:13.110
Justin,
something's wrong.

20:13.140 --> 20:16.040
I put this spell
on Harper and Zeke,

20:16.080 --> 20:18.550
and now there's
lightning between them
if they try to touch.

20:18.580 --> 20:21.880
Sparks Fly? You can't
use that on people.

20:21.920 --> 20:24.680
It fires up their emotion,
and anything can happen.

20:24.720 --> 20:27.550
Harper and Zeke
have become supercharged.

20:27.590 --> 20:30.560
Oh, Max! Max!

20:30.590 --> 20:33.890
- Yeah.
- The warning on this spell
wasn't about cake frosting.

20:33.930 --> 20:35.630
You can't use it on people!

20:35.660 --> 20:38.030
Right. Frosting
on people is bad.

20:39.560 --> 20:41.630
- Justin, what do I do?
- They're positively charged.

20:41.670 --> 20:43.470
You have to ground them
with a negative charge.

20:43.500 --> 20:45.970
Where am I gonna
find a negative charge
this late in the...

20:46.000 --> 20:48.400
Oh, I know
what you're thinking.

20:48.440 --> 20:50.310
You have to hug them.

20:50.340 --> 20:53.270
Fine! I get it.
I'm negative.

20:54.640 --> 20:56.310
I'll do it, but I'm not
gonna be happy about it,

20:56.340 --> 20:58.250
which will probably be
better for them.

20:58.280 --> 21:00.020
Yes.

21:00.720 --> 21:02.180
Shoo, fly!

21:05.260 --> 21:06.650
My dear friends.

21:14.560 --> 21:16.530
What happened?

21:16.560 --> 21:18.730
The science fair
is right now?

21:18.760 --> 21:22.170
Oh, my gosh, we forgot to finish
Ms. Sew-boto Roboto!

21:22.200 --> 21:24.900
- No!
- No!

21:24.940 --> 21:27.540
Why, oh, why?!

21:31.610 --> 21:34.940
Hey, what do I get
for my science project
on electricity?

21:34.980 --> 21:36.950
A cup? Ribbon?

21:36.980 --> 21:38.010
Somethin'?

21:46.870 --> 21:49.040
Harper? Sorry. Can I talk
to you for a second?

21:49.070 --> 21:50.400
Oh, yeah.

21:50.440 --> 21:52.540
Oh.
Sorry.

21:52.570 --> 21:53.610
Yeah.

21:59.310 --> 22:02.280
I used a spell
to get you guys to go out

22:02.320 --> 22:05.320
when you asked me not
to meddle, and I'm sorry.

22:05.350 --> 22:09.950
And now,
I see that I used magic
when I didn't have to.

22:09.990 --> 22:14.590
The real magic is you two
working together.

22:14.620 --> 22:16.560
Aww! Thanks, Alex.

22:18.390 --> 22:21.600
- I did land a very special boy.
- Yes.

22:27.400 --> 22:29.170
Doin' good, babe.

22:29.810 --> 22:31.130
Doin' good.
