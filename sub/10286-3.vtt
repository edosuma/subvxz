WEBVTT

00:04.440 --> 00:06.738
Hey, hey, hey! Judge!

00:06.909 --> 00:08.536
Any disembowelments tonight?

00:08.711 --> 00:10.269
Not that I know of, no.

00:10.446 --> 00:12.640
Mutilation murders? Bizarre suicides?

00:12.814 --> 00:15.374
Nothing good on TV tonight,
huh, Mr?

00:15.550 --> 00:17.609
- Craven. Al Craven.
- Yeah.

00:17.786 --> 00:21.017
<i>With the Gazette. I did that big
front-page story last week...</i>

00:21.189 --> 00:23.817
...on the lady who fricasseed the poodle.

00:24.392 --> 00:26.917
- AI Craven, the journalist.
- Yeah.

00:27.095 --> 00:30.962
You know, I really like it here in court.
There's always a never-ending supply...

00:31.131 --> 00:33.691
...of human misery in a place like this.
- Yeah.

00:33.867 --> 00:36.529
Most people don't see the fun side
of pain and suffering.

00:36.704 --> 00:38.604
Right.

00:39.573 --> 00:41.473
See you.

00:44.010 --> 00:45.307
Cute kid, the judge.

00:45.478 --> 00:48.208
Well, we think so,
but he's not exactly a kid.

00:48.381 --> 00:49.712
- Is this seat taken?
- Yes.

00:49.882 --> 00:51.315
Thank you.

00:52.285 --> 00:54.480
He doesn't even look old enough
to use a razor.

00:54.654 --> 00:57.487
Oh, and speaking of razors,
you would be revolted...

00:57.657 --> 01:00.625
...at what I've seen a razor do
to the human body.

01:02.761 --> 01:05.628
Be that as it may, Judge Stone
is older than you think.

01:05.797 --> 01:07.662
Well, how old is he?

01:07.833 --> 01:10.859
Well, he's... I don't know.
How old do you think he is, Dan?

01:11.436 --> 01:14.233
I don't know. It's one of those things
I never think about...

01:14.405 --> 01:16.771
...like "Is Pinky Lee still alive?"

01:17.375 --> 01:19.969
I'm sure you gotta be a minimum age
to be a judge.

01:20.144 --> 01:23.045
No, you have to have been practicing law
for at least 10 years.

01:23.214 --> 01:25.614
- I think he's about...
- Say, here's a novel approach:

01:25.783 --> 01:28.911
- Why don't we ask him. Judge Stone.
- Yo.

01:29.086 --> 01:32.145
We were just talking, and we're
a little curious. What is your age?

01:32.322 --> 01:34.620
Oh, I'm a little over 900 years old.

01:35.792 --> 01:37.953
That's what a spiritualist
once told me, anyway.

01:38.128 --> 01:40.722
Seems I have this very old soul.

01:41.331 --> 01:43.595
The first couple hundred years
are sort of a blur.

01:43.767 --> 01:46.530
- I know how you feel.
- Yeah.

01:46.702 --> 01:48.761
- Bye.
- See you.

01:50.572 --> 01:52.096
- Colorful guy.
- I'm telling you...

01:52.274 --> 01:55.334
...he has a few pages stuck together.

01:55.511 --> 01:56.739
Wanna talk crazy?

01:56.912 --> 01:59.574
You read the piece I did about the guy
who went berserk...

01:59.748 --> 02:01.738
...and turned his loved ones
into lunchmeat?

02:03.818 --> 02:08.084
Well, you'll have to excuse me.
All this lunch talk is making me hungry.

02:09.190 --> 02:11.681
I guess the judge is in his 20s.

02:11.859 --> 02:13.827
I say he's close to 40.

02:13.995 --> 02:16.292
In dog years, maybe.

02:16.596 --> 02:20.430
- I'll bet you 5 he's 28.
- You're on.

02:20.600 --> 02:22.591
- You got a bet.
- You're both acting selfish.

02:22.769 --> 02:25.203
Why don't we get a pool together
so we can all play.

02:25.539 --> 02:27.837
- Hey, now, that sounds good to me.
- Excuse me.

02:28.008 --> 02:30.840
How are you gonna determine the winner
if he won't tell his age.

02:31.010 --> 02:32.637
There's gotta be ways to find out.

02:32.812 --> 02:35.781
We could saw him in half
and count the rings.

02:36.515 --> 02:38.847
No. Hey, it's gotta be a matter
of public record...

02:39.018 --> 02:41.418
...like civil service forms or whatever,
right, Lana?

02:41.587 --> 02:43.020
- Yeah.
- Easily, Lana.

02:43.189 --> 02:46.988
Oh, I suppose I could call downtown
and get a look at his personnel file.

02:47.158 --> 02:50.719
It's settled. I'll make up the sign-up
sheet and we'll pick the ages we want.

02:50.895 --> 02:52.123
- I'm in.
- Good.

02:52.297 --> 02:54.629
- I don't know.
- Oh, it'll be fun.

02:54.799 --> 02:56.699
I feel like we're prying.

02:56.868 --> 02:58.995
That's the fun part.

02:59.904 --> 03:04.340
I really don't understand society's
preoccupation with age in the first place.

03:04.508 --> 03:07.204
I mean, you're only as old as you feel,
right, Selma?

03:07.378 --> 03:08.743
That's vicious.

03:10.000 --> 03:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:55.122 --> 03:57.022
Thank you.

04:00.594 --> 04:03.062
- What's this?
- The pool to guess Harry's age.

04:03.229 --> 04:05.754
- Oh, yeah.
- Now, there are still some good ages left...

04:05.932 --> 04:08.696
...so just put your initials
in any empty square.

04:11.471 --> 04:13.962
Don't press so hard.

04:14.874 --> 04:17.502
You crushed my nib.

04:18.545 --> 04:19.805
Sorry.

04:19.978 --> 04:21.673
Keep it.

04:21.846 --> 04:25.874
- What's next?
- Next we have a rather unusual case.

04:28.454 --> 04:30.046
- What's the problem?
- She's a slut.

04:30.222 --> 04:34.248
- He's an animal.
- Off the top of my head, marital problems?

04:34.425 --> 04:37.519
Not quite, Your Honor.
They never finished the ceremony.

04:38.830 --> 04:42.288
Ronald McKenzie, charged with destruction
of church property...

04:42.467 --> 04:45.231
...and disorderly conduct
in a house of worship.

04:45.403 --> 04:48.998
- Kind of pushing your luck, aren't you?
- Okay, so I got a little carried away.

04:49.173 --> 04:52.573
A little? He knocked the candelabras over,
smashed the flowers...

04:52.742 --> 04:55.233
...and destroyed the pulpit
with his bare hands.

04:55.579 --> 04:57.137
Second thoughts, Mr. McKenzie?

04:57.314 --> 04:58.713
I went out of my mind.

04:58.882 --> 05:02.010
Suppose on your wedding day
you saw your wife in the nude.

05:02.185 --> 05:05.085
I think I'll probably insist on it.

05:06.655 --> 05:09.954
My client was provoked, Your Honor,
pure and simple.

05:10.125 --> 05:14.789
You see, some jokers in the pews were
circulating naked photographs of the bride...

05:14.964 --> 05:17.296
...so naturally Mr. McKenzie
wasn't too pleased...

05:17.466 --> 05:21.162
...when his bride came down the aisle
to the sounds of stomping and whistling...

05:21.336 --> 05:26.364
...and shouts of "Hey, mama. Hey, mama.
You make me feel so good, mama."

05:30.178 --> 05:34.945
"Groom Tortured by Bride in the Buff."
How's that for a headline?

05:35.849 --> 05:39.979
Great. How's that for a cold sore?

05:42.322 --> 05:45.348
In the line of duty, Miss Williams,
do you have those pictures?

05:45.859 --> 05:49.659
Not in my possession, Your Honor,
but I believe you'll find the prosecution...

05:49.830 --> 05:52.662
...thumbing the evidence over there.

05:54.934 --> 05:56.925
- Mr. Fielding.
- What?

05:58.804 --> 06:01.500
Yes. Your Honor...

06:04.443 --> 06:06.842
I have no objection to the entrance
into evidence...

06:07.012 --> 06:10.573
<i>...the April, 1980 issue
of Stud magazine...</i>

06:10.749 --> 06:14.515
...bringing special attention
to pages 53, 54...

06:14.686 --> 06:17.120
...and 54a.

06:17.622 --> 06:20.785
- Your Honor, I object.
- Oh, I don't mind.

06:22.326 --> 06:26.092
Lana. The guy from
records retrieval is here.

06:30.935 --> 06:33.403
I got the file on Harold Stone.

06:33.571 --> 06:37.029
Wait a minute. This is sealed.
Why would his personnel record be sealed?

06:37.207 --> 06:40.232
- Oh, you wanted his personnel record?
- Yes. What's this?

06:40.410 --> 06:42.002
His criminal record.

06:44.113 --> 06:46.013
Criminal record?

06:46.349 --> 06:49.546
As far as anyone else is concerned,
I don't know anything about this.

06:49.719 --> 06:52.051
- Okay, I'll tell him.
- No. No.

06:53.221 --> 06:54.449
Wait.

06:54.623 --> 06:56.989
Yeah. Maybe we better have
a legal opinion.

06:57.159 --> 07:00.128
Why don't you tell Dan. But be discreet.

07:00.295 --> 07:03.992
I'm 6'8", 240, and I got no hair.

07:05.767 --> 07:08.360
- Do your best.
- Yeah.

07:10.237 --> 07:12.569
See what I mean, Your Honor?
Isn't it sickening?

07:12.740 --> 07:17.370
I didn't know you when those were taken.
I did it because I really needed the money.

07:17.545 --> 07:19.240
Things were tough for me then.

07:19.413 --> 07:24.372
- I had no job. I was hungry.
- Looks like you were cold too.

07:27.988 --> 07:30.183
Oh, no kidding?

07:31.858 --> 07:33.951
Something you'd like to share,
Mr. Fielding?

07:34.127 --> 07:36.891
No, no.

07:37.831 --> 07:40.799
Your Honor, the caseload
may get backed up if we don't...

07:40.966 --> 07:43.366
Get off the pot? Got it.

07:44.069 --> 07:47.004
Mr. McKenzie, do you have anything else
to say in your defense?

07:47.172 --> 07:49.265
Just that you can hardly blame me,
Your Honor.

07:49.441 --> 07:51.671
What kind of guy wants
his entire bowling team...

07:51.844 --> 07:53.971
...to know what his wife's goodies
look like?

07:54.779 --> 07:56.610
"Goodies"?

07:56.781 --> 08:02.913
It's a collective slang term representing five
separate portions of the female anatomy.

08:04.889 --> 08:07.449
<i>Five? One, two...</i>

08:10.827 --> 08:13.455
Mr. McKenzie, I do understand
how you feel...

08:13.630 --> 08:16.997
...but the fact remains that the lady
is not the one who's on trial here.

08:17.167 --> 08:20.227
Whether or not she should have posed
in the nude is not the point.

08:20.404 --> 08:22.998
Yeah? Well, the point is...

08:26.142 --> 08:28.736
...that I wanted you all to myself, Vickie.

08:28.911 --> 08:30.776
To me, your body is sacred.

08:30.946 --> 08:34.073
At least we agree on something.

08:35.217 --> 08:37.684
Look, maybe I'm not too proud
of those photos, okay?

08:37.852 --> 08:40.287
Maybe I was stupid to do it,
but it doesn't mean...

08:40.456 --> 08:42.684
...that I'm a bad person, does it?

08:42.857 --> 08:45.121
No, of course not.

08:45.293 --> 08:46.658
Hey, stuff it, rock face!

08:46.828 --> 08:49.524
- Mr. McKenzie...!
- Oh, now you shut up too for a minute!

08:49.698 --> 08:52.997
Ronald, stop it! You can't go around
telling people to shut up.

08:53.168 --> 08:55.295
- They won't like you.
- Everybody, shut up.

08:55.470 --> 08:58.370
I've been standing here looking
at nude pictures of my fiancée!

08:58.539 --> 09:00.097
All right!

09:00.274 --> 09:02.469
How about all you folks go out,
take a break...

09:02.643 --> 09:07.546
...and breathe into a paper bag, huh?
Ten minute recess.

09:13.886 --> 09:16.980
Okay, let's open this baby up, huh?

09:17.156 --> 09:20.717
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Sweetheart, I tipped the courier...

09:20.893 --> 09:23.293
...to find out what he gave you.
- You are really...

09:23.463 --> 09:25.693
...compost. You know that?
- Hey.

09:25.865 --> 09:30.358
I mean, garbage, slime, swill.
I have been called it all.

09:30.535 --> 09:33.163
How about maggot sandwich?

09:37.442 --> 09:40.605
Jackie O., Studio 54.

09:40.779 --> 09:43.747
- Go away, Craven.
- Listen, I know I'm gonna get that file...

09:43.914 --> 09:47.145
...even if I have to resort to legal means.

09:51.188 --> 09:52.951
Come on, sweetheart. Open up the file.

09:53.124 --> 09:55.718
There is no way you're getting
your slime-soaked hooks...

09:55.893 --> 09:59.157
...on the judge's record.
- "Slime-soaked hooks"?

10:00.196 --> 10:03.688
Look, it's probably just a youthful
offender thing if the file is sealed.

10:03.867 --> 10:07.098
From a legal standpoint,
a juvenile file doesn't even exist.

10:07.270 --> 10:09.602
It can only be opened
by an officer of the court.

10:09.773 --> 10:12.435
- Like her.
- Out.

10:12.609 --> 10:14.371
- Maybe just a tiny peek.
- Little, huh?

10:14.543 --> 10:16.033
- No.
- Oh, come on, sweetheart.

10:16.211 --> 10:18.577
- I'm not your sweetheart.
- You're dying to know...

10:18.747 --> 10:21.545
...what Judge Stone is hiding
just as much as the rest of us.

10:21.717 --> 10:23.776
- Who says he's hiding anything?
- Hey...

10:23.952 --> 10:28.513
...everybody's got something to hide, lady.
That's what makes this country great.

10:29.190 --> 10:33.490
- Would you just get out of here?!
- No. Not until I have that file. Here. Give...

10:33.661 --> 10:36.596
You are not getting it now.

10:41.435 --> 10:43.959
I've been in worse places.

10:45.539 --> 10:46.836
Shocking, isn't it?

10:47.307 --> 10:48.797
Yes.

10:48.975 --> 10:50.772
So, what do you think?

10:50.944 --> 10:53.139
Frankly, Judge Stone, I'm floored.

10:53.313 --> 10:55.611
Yeah. The groom seemed
a bit surprised by it too.

10:55.782 --> 10:58.148
- What?
- What I can't stop thinking is...

10:58.318 --> 11:01.844
...what kind of sick mind would dredge up
somebody's past like that?

11:02.021 --> 11:05.684
I mean, bringing those photos
to the wedding...

11:05.858 --> 11:09.988
Gee, come on! Whatever happened
to toaster ovens and blenders?

11:10.529 --> 11:12.963
Harry, if you have anything else
to tell us...

11:13.132 --> 11:15.827
...I want you to know I'll understand.

11:16.234 --> 11:20.068
No. I'm finished, but thanks
for being there.

11:21.339 --> 11:25.503
I believe what the lady is referring to
is a certain...

11:25.910 --> 11:28.105
...skeleton in your closet.

11:28.413 --> 11:31.210
Craven, I see your lips moving,
but I don't hear anything.

11:31.381 --> 11:34.942
How's this for a headline:
"The Hoodlum Judge."

11:36.286 --> 11:38.550
Gonna make a great story.

11:39.423 --> 11:41.186
What's he talking about?

11:41.658 --> 11:46.287
Well, Your Honor, he seems to have gotten
this silly notion that you have a...

11:47.797 --> 11:49.560
...criminal record.

11:53.936 --> 11:56.598
- How did you find out about that?
- Oh, I'll never tell.

11:56.772 --> 11:59.400
A good newsman always protects
his sources.

11:59.575 --> 12:01.633
Right, sweetheart?

12:06.848 --> 12:08.213
It was completely inadvertent.

12:08.383 --> 12:12.149
I had no idea I'd come across this file
when I was trying to track down... I mean...

12:12.320 --> 12:14.880
- Some other...
- Where's the file now?

12:18.792 --> 12:22.592
Harry, you have to believe me
that I had no idea I'd find this.

12:22.763 --> 12:25.823
- Well, what else you got in there?
- Nothing!

12:27.701 --> 12:30.169
I mean, nothing I'd wanna go public with.

12:30.671 --> 12:33.935
Okay, what was it, judge?
What did they put you away for?

12:34.107 --> 12:35.972
Nothing I wanna go public with.

12:36.142 --> 12:39.339
One way or another, I'm gonna find out
what you did and print it.

12:39.512 --> 12:42.538
Now, I might go a little easy on you
if you cooperate.

12:43.149 --> 12:47.107
- Let me put it this way: Get out.
- Okay, I'll start with "no comment."

12:47.286 --> 12:52.246
I mean, it sounds dry,
but it's very incriminating, and...

12:57.996 --> 13:02.092
Harry, I had no idea how damaging...

13:03.701 --> 13:06.169
- I feel awful.
- Lana, forget it.

13:06.337 --> 13:09.306
- It was bound to come out sooner or later.
- No, not forget it.

13:09.473 --> 13:11.236
This is terrible!

13:11.409 --> 13:13.809
- Lana, please!
- Really. And it's all my fault.

13:13.978 --> 13:16.412
You know, I could just kill myself.
I really could.

13:16.580 --> 13:18.809
I could just rip out my tongue
with my own hands.

13:18.982 --> 13:21.177
I could just slit my own throat.
I could just...

13:21.351 --> 13:24.115
Lana, can we have an end
to the bloodshed, please?

13:24.287 --> 13:26.949
Look, so Craven prints it.

13:27.123 --> 13:29.353
Now, what's the worst that can happen?

13:30.327 --> 13:32.989
Well, I'd be publicly disgraced...

13:33.163 --> 13:38.099
...making it impossible for me to continue
to function effectively as a judge.

13:38.267 --> 13:40.394
I'd have to step down.

13:40.569 --> 13:42.434
Right, but...

13:43.806 --> 13:46.366
...you've still got your health.

13:49.344 --> 13:52.507
I'm sorry. I've never tried
to cheer up anybody before.

13:59.687 --> 14:01.518
- All rise.
- Don't bother getting up.

14:01.689 --> 14:03.714
We're not starting yet.

14:04.858 --> 14:07.486
As some of you already know...

14:07.661 --> 14:10.562
...I was once in jail.
- Harry, don't do this.

14:10.731 --> 14:14.189
I mention that only because
it seems germane to this case.

14:14.368 --> 14:18.464
However Miss Guyer feels about having
posed nude, it's done.

14:18.638 --> 14:21.401
It's a fact that can't be changed.

14:21.574 --> 14:23.940
And it's the same with what I did.

14:24.110 --> 14:27.443
- What did you do?
- I'm getting to that.

14:27.613 --> 14:30.707
Just a second, judge.
I wanna take a few notes.

14:30.883 --> 14:32.714
Okay, Craven. Get your pen out.

14:32.885 --> 14:34.113
You ready?

14:34.286 --> 14:35.843
I knocked over a liquor store.

14:36.021 --> 14:39.354
- You committed armed robbery?
- No. I knocked over a liquor store.

14:39.524 --> 14:43.551
The front part of it, anyway,
with a '64 Cadillac convertible.

14:43.728 --> 14:47.459
- I owned one of those once.
- Did you? I didn't.

14:47.766 --> 14:50.893
- You mean you stole the car?
- Impulsive, huh?

14:51.068 --> 14:52.399
But I was a teenager then.

14:52.569 --> 14:57.165
All I meant to do was drive around the block
a couple of times and take it back...

14:57.341 --> 14:59.866
...but my foot slipped off
the brake pedal, and...

15:01.078 --> 15:02.807
Correct.

15:03.947 --> 15:07.507
I only spent two nights in jail
and a couple of weeks in the reformatory...

15:07.683 --> 15:10.277
...but it affected me
for the rest of my life.

15:10.820 --> 15:13.220
- Being in jail?
- No.

15:13.389 --> 15:16.847
Being in the path of my father's stare.

15:18.394 --> 15:22.557
Believe me, in 20 minutes,
I spent my time in hell.

15:23.398 --> 15:27.061
It was a courtroom like this,
and he sat right there.

15:31.973 --> 15:34.441
You would have thought
he could have blinked or...

15:34.609 --> 15:37.941
...something. He could have reached out
and slapped me or...

15:38.112 --> 15:41.013
...yelled at me or beat me, but...

15:41.549 --> 15:45.041
...damn it, he just sat there
and looked at me.

15:46.153 --> 15:48.451
And then when it was all over...

15:48.622 --> 15:50.487
...all he said was:

15:51.158 --> 15:54.320
"You disappointed me, Harold."

16:01.534 --> 16:04.128
When a boy loves his father...

16:05.972 --> 16:08.098
...he would rather get...

16:09.675 --> 16:13.634
...knocked across the head
with a two-by-four...

16:14.379 --> 16:17.439
...than hear that kind of stuff.

16:26.390 --> 16:27.982
Well, anyway...

16:28.159 --> 16:31.754
...not too long after that, he just...

16:31.929 --> 16:33.863
...sort of died.

16:36.801 --> 16:39.598
It always kind of bugged me, you know.

16:39.769 --> 16:41.999
That he never found out...

16:42.172 --> 16:44.197
...that...

16:45.475 --> 16:49.172
...I hadn't made a habit
out of stealing cars.

16:51.348 --> 16:53.975
Let the record show
that I convened court...

16:54.150 --> 16:57.051
...I found the defendant, Ronald McKenzie,
guilty as charged...

16:57.219 --> 16:59.187
...asked him to pay restitution...

16:59.355 --> 17:02.654
...and gave him a 10-day
suspended sentence.

17:03.592 --> 17:05.958
And then I called a recess.

17:14.202 --> 17:15.499
Harry?

17:19.174 --> 17:21.108
Harry?

17:24.478 --> 17:26.377
Harry?

17:27.013 --> 17:28.641
Harry.

17:28.815 --> 17:30.442
My God.

17:31.185 --> 17:34.416
- I thought you were...
- What? Resting comfortably?

17:36.190 --> 17:39.318
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine. I just...

17:39.493 --> 17:42.393
...had a little attack
of the past, you know?

17:42.562 --> 17:46.225
Maybe it's just time I learned
that I can't change it.

17:46.832 --> 17:50.268
"Things that are done, it is needless
to speak about.

17:50.570 --> 17:54.165
Things that are past,
it is needless to blame."

17:54.340 --> 17:55.931
Confucius?

17:56.107 --> 17:57.631
Probably.

17:58.343 --> 18:01.779
In any case, it's the longest message
I ever read in a fortune cookie.

18:05.083 --> 18:06.641
It's okay.

18:08.420 --> 18:11.013
- Anybody home?
- This isn't what you were thinking.

18:11.188 --> 18:13.179
I mean, I'm engaged.

18:14.592 --> 18:17.083
No, we just thought you were
comforting a friend.

18:18.062 --> 18:20.724
Then it was. I mean,
what you were thinking.

18:22.199 --> 18:25.032
- Your Honor, are you all right?
- We were worried about you.

18:25.202 --> 18:28.864
I'm fine. Thank you all very much
for being concerned, really.

18:29.038 --> 18:31.836
Knock, knock.
Look what the cat dragged in.

18:33.876 --> 18:36.310
I thought I'd save somebody
the trouble of saying it.

18:36.479 --> 18:38.276
You back for more dirt, Craven?

18:38.448 --> 18:40.143
What, that car stuff? Are you crazy?

18:40.316 --> 18:44.183
"Joyriding Judge"? What the hell is that?
I can't print that.

18:45.554 --> 18:47.283
I mean, that's nothing.

18:47.456 --> 18:50.823
Now, take the piece I did on the deranged
men's room attendant in Queens.

18:50.993 --> 18:52.722
No.

18:52.894 --> 18:54.623
You take it and...

18:55.964 --> 18:58.022
I'm way ahead of you.

19:16.182 --> 19:17.706
Hello.

19:17.884 --> 19:20.785
Oh, look. It's my favorite pair.

19:24.991 --> 19:26.822
What can we do for you kids?

19:26.993 --> 19:30.621
Well, I hate to bother you again,
judge, but...

19:30.796 --> 19:33.424
...could you marry us?
- It's on again, huh?

19:33.732 --> 19:37.031
You made me realize that if you've got
a chance at something, well...

19:37.202 --> 19:39.864
...who knows, it may be your last, right?

19:40.572 --> 19:43.563
Gee, Ronnie, I never heard you talk
that way before.

19:43.741 --> 19:47.108
- It excites me.
- I know how you feel.

19:51.649 --> 19:52.980
So, what do you say, judge?

19:53.151 --> 19:55.278
Sure. Make an appointment
with Miss Wagner...

19:55.453 --> 19:58.421
No, you see, the suit has to be back
in the morning.

20:00.090 --> 20:01.557
You mean?

20:02.292 --> 20:07.252
- Sure! What the heck? Why not?
- Oh, my God. We're having a wedding.

20:07.431 --> 20:10.958
- Now? Surely you don't intend...
- I think all we need is a marriage license.

20:11.134 --> 20:12.499
Here you go, sir.

20:13.303 --> 20:15.702
Dan, Liz, come on over here.
You'll be the witnesses.

20:15.871 --> 20:18.305
That's really a lovely thought,
but I think maybe...

20:18.474 --> 20:21.341
- Here. You stand over here.
- I don't think this is the time.

20:21.510 --> 20:22.738
We're ready now.

20:22.912 --> 20:24.311
Fine.

20:24.947 --> 20:27.677
You stop following me around.

20:28.584 --> 20:30.642
I just wanna get to know you better.

20:30.819 --> 20:34.949
Here's all you need to know.
I'm armed.

20:35.123 --> 20:37.648
- What's doing?
- These two are getting married.

20:37.826 --> 20:40.192
Oh, which is the bride's side?

20:40.595 --> 20:42.586
- Over there.
- Thank you.

20:42.764 --> 20:44.425
- Forgetting something?
- What's this?

20:44.598 --> 20:46.122
The text of the ceremony.

20:47.434 --> 20:49.595
"Dearly beloved..."

20:51.672 --> 20:54.197
Let's just let her rip.

20:55.008 --> 20:56.498
Vickie...

20:56.677 --> 20:59.271
...you really love this little hothead,
don't you?

20:59.446 --> 21:02.312
- I beg your pardon?
- Just answer the question.

21:02.482 --> 21:03.949
- Yes.
- Yeah. I thought so.

21:04.117 --> 21:07.314
And, Ronnie, you feel like she's
the only woman in the world for you?

21:07.487 --> 21:09.079
- I do.
- Really?

21:09.255 --> 21:11.815
- What do you want? Blood?
- Just checking.

21:11.991 --> 21:14.459
Do you promise to try to show her
that you love her...

21:14.627 --> 21:17.220
...and not just flop down
in front of the TV every night?

21:17.396 --> 21:19.125
- Yeah. Whatever you say.
- Okay.

21:19.297 --> 21:21.959
Do you promise not to jump him
with a bunch of problems...

21:22.134 --> 21:23.533
...when he comes in from work?

21:23.702 --> 21:28.002
And do you promise not to make
other plans for him on Super Bowl Sunday?

21:28.173 --> 21:32.040
- What?
- What happened to love, honor and cherish?

21:32.209 --> 21:34.803
Grow up. It's 1984.

21:36.280 --> 21:39.443
We're talking about being sensitive
and considerate...

21:39.617 --> 21:41.244
...to another person's feelings.

21:41.419 --> 21:44.752
And if you promise to do that
to the best of your ability...

21:44.922 --> 21:47.913
...then I don't know how you can help
but be happy.

21:54.831 --> 21:56.230
That's it.

21:57.333 --> 21:59.699
- That's what?
- It's over.

21:59.869 --> 22:02.428
- It is?
- Hey, I just made you listen to that stuff.

22:02.604 --> 22:06.973
Technically, I don't have to say anything and
you're married. From now on, it's up to you.

22:07.476 --> 22:09.501
You may kiss the bride.

22:16.819 --> 22:19.582
And you may hug the judge.

22:22.089 --> 22:24.455
I wish we had some rice
to throw on them.

22:24.625 --> 22:26.422
How about paper clips?

22:28.296 --> 22:30.230
Well, thank you all. Goodbye.

22:30.398 --> 22:33.025
- Good luck. Take care.
- Yeah. Bye. Thank you very much.

22:33.200 --> 22:34.690
Happy honeymoon!

22:34.868 --> 22:36.893
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

22:37.771 --> 22:39.432
I doubt if I could.

22:42.442 --> 22:44.205
Hey, everybody, come on.

22:44.377 --> 22:46.777
All over to my place for the reception.

22:47.013 --> 22:48.240
Where do you live?

22:48.414 --> 22:50.974
Sixth Avenue and 42nd Street.

22:52.117 --> 22:53.345
That's a park.

22:53.519 --> 22:55.885
Dress accordingly.

22:59.625 --> 23:00.819
By the way, folks...

23:00.993 --> 23:04.359
...I don't know why it makes any difference
to anyone. It sure shouldn't.

23:04.529 --> 23:07.191
But for the record, I'm 34 years old.

23:07.365 --> 23:09.458
The pool!

23:09.634 --> 23:13.468
- I had 28.
- Thirty-four...

23:13.638 --> 23:16.835
"HTS." Who's HTS?

23:21.645 --> 23:23.670
Call it a hunch.
