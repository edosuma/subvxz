WEBVTT

00:00.057 --> 00:02.457
<i>Yeah, I was on hold,</i>
<i>but I got disconnected.</i>

00:02.459 --> 00:05.127
<i>From Yonkers.</i>

00:05.129 --> 00:08.296
<i>The mayor of the city.</i>

00:08.298 --> 00:09.798
<i>Yeah, Wasicsko.</i>

00:09.800 --> 00:13.769
W-A-S-I-C--

00:13.771 --> 00:15.854
No, no, no, "C,"
as in "Charles."

00:15.856 --> 00:17.355
"S," as in "Sam."

00:17.357 --> 00:20.108
"K," yeah, right. _

00:21.695 --> 00:23.645
Yeah, yeah,
I called before.

00:23.647 --> 00:28.066
From Yonkers, that's right.
Yonkers, New York.

00:28.068 --> 00:29.701
Because if
the governor were to act

00:29.703 --> 00:32.204
and maybe remove some
of these recalcitrant council members,

00:32.206 --> 00:34.206
then we could get the city
out of contempt

00:34.208 --> 00:36.124
and get some control
over the...

00:37.878 --> 00:40.212
Yeah, sure, I'll hold.

00:40.214 --> 00:41.213
Believe me,
I've been calling

00:41.215 --> 00:43.081
Governor Cuomo's
office nonstop,

00:43.083 --> 00:44.416
and they keep trying
to pass me over

00:44.418 --> 00:46.134
to the Westchester
Republicans.

00:46.136 --> 00:48.136
Like the Republicans
are gonna ride to the rescue

00:48.138 --> 00:50.172
of public housing
for a Democratic mayor.

00:52.009 --> 00:54.259
I-- That's true,
no doubt,

00:54.261 --> 00:55.393
but Senator Moynihan
has been known

00:55.395 --> 00:57.179
for taking politically
courageous stands.

00:57.181 --> 00:59.764
And I think that if he were
to come down to Yonkers--

00:59.766 --> 01:00.849
Okay, you know what?

01:00.851 --> 01:02.684
Tell Mario that I know
that he knows

01:02.686 --> 01:05.437
he's got the power
to bounce these buffoons

01:05.438 --> 01:08.990
for malfeasance,
misfeasance, nonfeasance--

01:08.992 --> 01:11.109
any of the "feasance" family.

01:16.200 --> 01:17.699
What if the senator
issued a statement saying

01:17.701 --> 01:21.203
that he supports the City of Yonkers
obeying the judge's order?

01:23.207 --> 01:25.540
All right, yeah,
you know, just like a--

01:25.542 --> 01:28.844
a paragraph saying that we're
trying to do the right thing here. Nay!

01:28.846 --> 01:30.795
Sure, yeah. Can I--
can I just talk to the governor?

01:30.797 --> 01:33.431
Can I, please?
Can I hear that from him?

01:33.433 --> 01:34.883
Well, because I was
under the impression

01:34.885 --> 01:36.351
that Mario Cuomo
was like, you know,

01:36.353 --> 01:38.386
some great white hope
for liberals everywhere.

01:38.388 --> 01:40.972
And I could really
use a little hope right now.

01:40.974 --> 01:43.608
S-I-C--

01:43.610 --> 01:46.144
No, no, "C,"
as in "chump."

01:46.146 --> 01:47.479
"S," as in "Sam,"

01:47.481 --> 01:50.031
"K," as in "kite," O.

01:51.368 --> 01:53.985
Right, "O,"
as in "Oh, shit,

01:53.987 --> 01:56.121
it's that guy from Yonkers
calling again,

01:56.123 --> 01:58.323
asking if he can get
any help from anybody

01:58.325 --> 02:01.877
in the goddamn Democratic Party
from the State of New York."

02:03.797 --> 02:05.830
Sure, I'll hold.
Why not?

02:05.832 --> 02:08.800
That's fine.

02:18.285 --> 02:21.611
_

02:23.333 --> 02:26.434
Sure. There are two black girls
on my bowling team.

02:26.436 --> 02:28.436
I haven't been
in their homes,

02:28.438 --> 02:30.238
but I've driven
them home

02:30.240 --> 02:31.990
up in, uh,
Runyon Heights.

02:31.992 --> 02:34.025
So, it's not
about race?

02:34.027 --> 02:36.111
No, no.

02:36.113 --> 02:38.280
What is it,
then?

02:38.282 --> 02:39.864
It's an
economic issue.

02:39.866 --> 02:41.700
People are worried about
their property values.

02:41.702 --> 02:44.703
They're worried about
the drugs and crime

02:44.705 --> 02:46.371
that are in
the projects.

02:47.791 --> 02:50.125
Have you seen those pictures
that Councilman Spallone has?

02:50.127 --> 02:51.509
Yeah, I heard
about them.

02:51.511 --> 02:55.046
But does Mr. Spallone
speak for you?

02:55.048 --> 02:59.634
I think he speaks for most
of the people in Yonkers. I do.

02:59.636 --> 03:01.937
But why are you talking to me?
Talk to him.

03:01.939 --> 03:03.188
You came all the way
to report on this.

03:03.190 --> 03:05.307
I will, but you've become

03:05.309 --> 03:06.975
one of the most vocal
of the Yonkers residents.

03:06.977 --> 03:10.028
Well, I don't miss
a council meeting.

03:10.030 --> 03:12.397
I don't miss a community meeting
or a protest.

03:12.399 --> 03:14.065
No, you sure don't,
Mrs. Dorman.

03:16.320 --> 03:17.953
I joined "Save Yonkers"

03:17.955 --> 03:21.539
because of this Judge Sand
and what he's trying to do.

03:21.541 --> 03:23.708
He wants to take
low-income housing

03:23.710 --> 03:26.661
and put it all in one place
in East Yonkers.

03:26.663 --> 03:30.298
That's seven,
eight hundred people--

03:30.300 --> 03:33.835
and just drop them
right here.

03:33.837 --> 03:36.504
So, if the housing
gets built,

03:36.506 --> 03:38.256
will you move
from here?

03:41.478 --> 03:44.479
I love this house.
I have always loved our little house.

03:44.481 --> 03:47.098
It's on my favorite block
in the whole city.

03:47.100 --> 03:48.984
It's true. I always
said to my husband,

03:48.986 --> 03:52.687
"Buddy, if I can't have a brick house
on Saint John's Avenue,

03:52.689 --> 03:54.689
I don't want a house."

03:54.691 --> 03:55.991
It is beautiful.

03:55.993 --> 03:59.411
It is. Thank you.
It really is.

03:59.413 --> 04:03.031
I fell in love with it
the first time I saw it.

04:03.033 --> 04:07.035
Do you think the families
that might move into these houses--

04:07.037 --> 04:08.536
do you think they
might see those houses

04:08.538 --> 04:11.623
the same way
as you see yours?

04:11.625 --> 04:13.508
Well, if they did,
then Mr. Spallone

04:13.510 --> 04:18.046
wouldn't have those pictures
to show everyone, right?

04:18.048 --> 04:22.434
If they did, then they
wouldn't need to move

04:22.436 --> 04:24.019
out of the projects
in the first place.

04:24.021 --> 04:27.972
They'd take care
of their homes.

04:27.974 --> 04:29.224
I just think
you shouldn't

04:29.226 --> 04:32.143
take people with
one lifestyle

04:32.145 --> 04:35.063
and, uh, put them
smack in the middle

04:35.065 --> 04:37.365
of a place with
a different lifestyle.

05:22.446 --> 05:24.746
<i>So we've been staying
up in Mulford Gardens,</i>

05:24.748 --> 05:26.781
<i>um, with some folk, but</i>

05:26.783 --> 05:29.084
that's my grandmother by my husband,

05:29.086 --> 05:33.588
and he died,
so we can't stay there long.

05:33.590 --> 05:35.757
Other family here
in Yonkers?

05:35.759 --> 05:37.876
My parents, they live
all the way in Jersey.

05:37.878 --> 05:40.795
I live here now.

05:40.797 --> 05:42.514
Well, with the baby,

05:42.516 --> 05:44.432
you're on our
priority waitlist.

05:44.434 --> 05:48.136
<i>But right now, you know,</i>
<i>we have nothing open anywhere--</i>

05:48.138 --> 05:50.939
not School, not Schlobohm,
not Mulford Gardens--

05:50.941 --> 05:53.808
- You don't have anything?
- <i> Not in Yonkers.</i>

05:53.810 --> 05:57.645
Um, we do have a room
in emergency housing

05:57.647 --> 06:00.448
in Yorktown Heights
if you want that.

06:00.450 --> 06:02.484
Yorktown Heights?

06:02.486 --> 06:04.486
Where's that?

06:04.488 --> 06:07.739
Shh.

06:10.744 --> 06:12.911
- Who lives here?
- Nobody.

06:16.500 --> 06:18.166
- Who owns it?
- I don't know.

06:20.003 --> 06:21.002
It's been on
the market forever.

06:21.004 --> 06:22.720
I've been coming here
for, like, a year.

06:22.722 --> 06:24.139
Look. Look
at this view.

06:26.726 --> 06:29.928
- Wow.
- Right?

06:29.930 --> 06:31.846
I mean...

06:31.848 --> 06:33.848
This is where
I imagine myself,

06:33.850 --> 06:35.683
right up here.

06:35.685 --> 06:38.520
You, me,
a couple of kids running around.

06:38.522 --> 06:41.689
I mean, I could walk
to work from here.

06:41.691 --> 06:43.525
Kids ask, "Where's Dad?"
And you point over there.

06:43.527 --> 06:46.161
You're like,
"Council meeting's on tonight. See?

06:46.163 --> 06:48.446
Lights are on.
He's in his office."

06:48.448 --> 06:49.864
Unless, of course,
I'm in Congress already,

06:49.866 --> 06:53.251
in which case, you'd point somewhere
in that direction over there.

06:56.339 --> 06:58.873
So you want to buy
something like this?

07:00.460 --> 07:03.044
Are you crazy?

07:03.046 --> 07:04.212
Yeah, probably.

07:06.516 --> 07:08.550
<i>Come here.</i>

07:09.886 --> 07:12.103
I mean this--
this could be

07:12.105 --> 07:14.439
the best house
in Yonkers.

07:14.441 --> 07:16.357
You know,
a little work, a little money.

07:16.359 --> 07:19.811
- A lot.
- Always wanted a house like this.

07:19.813 --> 07:22.230
- How much is it?
- I have no idea.

07:22.232 --> 07:23.648
You don't know?

07:23.650 --> 07:25.200
No, no, no.
I never called the number.

07:25.202 --> 07:26.451
Shit, I didn't
have you with me.

07:26.453 --> 07:29.037
I wasn't mayor
of Yonkers.

07:29.039 --> 07:31.656
- "Youngest mayor in America," right?
- Mm-hmm.

07:31.658 --> 07:33.074
No, I was just
a councilman.

07:33.076 --> 07:35.994
I hadn't done anything
to deserve a home like this.

07:40.967 --> 07:44.252
You know, I was-- I was against
the housing and I won?

07:44.254 --> 07:45.336
And now I'm
for the housing,

07:45.338 --> 07:46.588
and I'm getting
my ass kicked for it,

07:46.590 --> 07:48.006
so maybe I had it
coming to me.

07:48.008 --> 07:50.008
But I think for the
first time in my life,

07:50.010 --> 07:52.227
I am on the right
side of something,

07:52.229 --> 07:54.846
and I am all alone.

07:54.848 --> 07:57.265
I'm not getting any help
from the council, the party--

07:57.267 --> 07:59.100
Cuomo, Moynihan--
none of them.

07:59.102 --> 08:02.270
Why won't the governor just
remove Spallone and the others, you know?

08:02.272 --> 08:04.105
He-- he won't even
get on the phone with me,

08:04.107 --> 08:05.573
much less lose votes
over this thing.

08:05.575 --> 08:08.776
But the thing is,
people just want a home, right?

08:08.778 --> 08:11.579
It's the same
for everybody.

08:11.581 --> 08:13.248
This whole mess
is over 200 homes

08:13.250 --> 08:16.200
in the city of tens of thousands
of homes, and so what?

08:16.202 --> 08:19.287
I mean, we lost
our fucking minds over this shit.

08:19.289 --> 08:20.622
We're about to
bankrupt the city,

08:20.624 --> 08:23.291
and, I mean, at some point
people come to their senses

08:23.293 --> 08:25.093
and I win.

08:25.095 --> 08:28.963
And I come out of this
looking better than ever.

08:28.965 --> 08:29.964
Maybe I come out of this
and give D'Amato

08:29.966 --> 08:31.883
a run for his money,
you know?

08:31.885 --> 08:35.303
I don't know.
Senate might be too big of a jump,

08:35.304 --> 08:38.056
but congressional seat
at least.

08:39.476 --> 08:40.975
Right?

08:40.977 --> 08:44.812
Yeah, it could be
a beautiful house.

08:44.814 --> 08:47.231
- I know, right?
- Mm-hmm.

08:50.487 --> 08:52.320
You're gonna call on it?

08:52.322 --> 08:54.989
Yeah.

08:54.991 --> 08:56.824
Well, maybe
it's cheaper than we think.

08:58.461 --> 09:00.828
Maybe it's haunted.

09:00.830 --> 09:03.298
- Maybe it's on an Indian burial ground.
- No!

09:03.300 --> 09:05.500
Oh, shit, maybe it's
on Oscar Newman's list

09:05.502 --> 09:07.919
of alternate sites
for public housing units.

09:09.673 --> 09:11.172
Ma, we ain't taking no.

09:11.174 --> 09:13.174
Now, this is what they call
an "intervention."

09:13.176 --> 09:15.426
So, I'm 47
years old,

09:15.428 --> 09:17.512
raised both of you
out of diapers and piss pants,

09:17.514 --> 09:19.897
and now you intervening
in my life?

09:19.899 --> 09:21.182
You need some help.

09:21.184 --> 09:23.985
Pat and Phyllis
come over most every day.

09:23.987 --> 09:26.237
- And Tasha here--
- What about when I'm in school?

09:26.239 --> 09:28.990
The government will pay
for a home health aide to come help out.

09:28.992 --> 09:30.658
We just have to fill out
the application.

09:30.660 --> 09:33.161
The same government that turned down
my disability paperwork?

09:33.163 --> 09:35.530
- You finally got that, though.
- Because of Pat.

09:35.532 --> 09:37.865
But you got it,
and we'll get this.

09:39.919 --> 09:42.537
Ma, you'll still
be able to go out,

09:42.539 --> 09:44.088
and we'll still be here with you.
Come on.

09:50.630 --> 09:52.847
<i>Carmen. Carmen, Carmen?</i>

09:52.849 --> 09:55.099
Carmen!

09:55.101 --> 09:56.884
Your mom called from the DR.

09:56.886 --> 09:58.886
She wants you
to call her back when you can.

10:01.808 --> 10:04.642
<i>Thank you.</i>

10:33.006 --> 10:34.472
Anita, it's Carmen.

10:43.600 --> 10:44.932
Felipe?

10:50.857 --> 10:54.275
Emergency Financial Control Board
of Yonkers is now in session.

10:55.945 --> 10:57.245
<i>In light of</i>
<i>the pending fines</i>

10:57.247 --> 10:59.113
<i>proposed by</i>
<i>the US District Court,</i>

10:59.115 --> 11:00.615
the resolution
before the board

11:00.617 --> 11:03.668
is to freeze all hiring
and discretionary spending

11:03.670 --> 11:04.952
by the City of Yonkers.

11:04.954 --> 11:06.621
Madam Chair,
if I may?

11:06.623 --> 11:08.506
Instead of tying
the city's purse strings,

11:08.508 --> 11:10.258
how about the board
ask Governor Cuomo

11:10.260 --> 11:11.626
to step in
and do something about it?

11:11.628 --> 11:14.595
Mr. DeLuca, this is
the City of Yonkers' problem.

11:16.349 --> 11:17.765
"You have
the responsibility

11:17.767 --> 11:20.051
to yourself
and to your city's future

11:20.053 --> 11:22.220
to express
your reasoned concern

11:22.222 --> 11:23.471
to the four people
you elected

11:23.473 --> 11:26.023
who have brought you
to this precipice.

11:26.025 --> 11:29.560
<i>If the council does not purge</i>
<i>its contemptuous behavior,</i>

11:29.562 --> 11:32.280
<i>you face the prospect</i>
<i>of no municipal services</i>

11:32.282 --> 11:33.698
whatsoever.

11:33.700 --> 11:36.451
No policeman
when you call for help,

11:36.453 --> 11:39.036
<i>no firefighter</i>
<i>when your house is burning.</i>

11:39.038 --> 11:42.406
<i>No garbage pickup</i>
<i>as the trash piles up on the curb.</i>

11:42.408 --> 11:43.908
No senior citizen services,

11:43.910 --> 11:46.994
no water as the tap runs dry.

11:46.996 --> 11:48.412
<i>The question is,</i>

11:48.414 --> 11:51.382
<i>can you reasonably accept</i>
<i>these consequences,</i>

11:51.384 --> 11:53.551
which loom as a direct result

11:53.553 --> 11:57.338
of your city council's
refusal to uphold the law?"

12:01.144 --> 12:04.145
Shh. Shh.

12:04.147 --> 12:06.347
It's okay.

12:06.349 --> 12:08.349
We got this, little man, huh?

12:08.351 --> 12:09.734
All right.

12:12.989 --> 12:14.322
Shh.

12:17.193 --> 12:19.360
All right.

12:31.508 --> 12:35.176
Okay.
Let's just check it out.

12:35.178 --> 12:36.627
Shh.

12:44.270 --> 12:47.429
I swear to you, Javier, you're gonna
regret the day you were born

12:47.430 --> 12:48.619
if Felipe doesn't come back.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.079
Right now, motherfucker.

12:50.080 --> 12:52.267
You're not gonna do
that to him or to me.

12:52.302 --> 12:54.529
Listen to me.
Listen to me, Javier,

12:54.531 --> 12:56.230
because I'm gonna
tell you in English.

12:56.232 --> 12:59.317
English, yes.
Do you know why?

12:59.319 --> 13:02.370
Because, Felipe,
he is a US citizen,

13:02.372 --> 13:04.038
and you cannot kidnap
a US citizen.

13:04.040 --> 13:06.541
Because if you do,
I am going to have you rot in--

13:06.543 --> 13:08.242
<i>Idiot!</i>

13:08.244 --> 13:09.744
Javier?

13:17.971 --> 13:20.338
<i>Please hang up.</i>

13:20.340 --> 13:22.590
<i>There appears to be a
receiver off the hook.</i>

13:32.101 --> 13:34.318
This is what they call
"Upstate," isn't it?

13:36.322 --> 13:38.489
Upstate New York?

13:38.491 --> 13:40.408
Hmm. I guess.

13:42.111 --> 13:45.029
People say this is where
the Ku Klux Klan at.

13:47.450 --> 13:49.116
I mean, people say that.

13:54.674 --> 13:57.091
We downstate girls,
ain't we?

14:00.179 --> 14:02.380
The "Doomsday Plan"

14:02.382 --> 14:04.966
calls for laying off
447 employees,

14:04.968 --> 14:06.100
<i>almost a quarter</i>
<i>of the workforce,</i>

14:06.102 --> 14:08.135
<i>by Saturday</i>
<i>in order to accommodate</i>

14:08.137 --> 14:10.721
<i>the million-dollar-a-day fines</i>
<i>that begin Friday.</i>

14:10.723 --> 14:15.276
Madam Chair?
I do not see the need for 447 workers

14:15.278 --> 14:16.978
<i>and their families</i>
<i>to be hurt.</i>

14:16.980 --> 14:21.065
The city's plan extends services
through November 24.

14:21.067 --> 14:23.618
<i>Besides, a solution</i>
<i>might come this week.</i>

14:23.620 --> 14:24.819
<i>This is really severe.</i>

14:24.821 --> 14:25.870
<i>With all due respect</i>

14:25.872 --> 14:27.154
to the city manager,
the board feels

14:27.156 --> 14:28.572
the most essential priority
is to keep police

14:28.574 --> 14:30.658
and fire protection
as long as possible.

14:30.660 --> 14:34.128
And therefore we're making
more cuts upfront.

14:34.130 --> 14:37.415
The City of Yonkers
must confront reality

14:37.417 --> 14:39.166
in a very decisive way.

14:39.168 --> 14:41.886
<i>The time for</i>
<i>finger-pointing is over.</i>

14:41.888 --> 14:43.754
<i>The time for punting is over.</i>

14:43.756 --> 14:46.173
<i>This board was sent</i>
<i>from Albany</i>

14:46.175 --> 14:49.510
<i>to save Yonkers from itself.</i>

14:49.512 --> 14:51.846
Do you wanna go to Tuckahoe,
get something to eat?

14:51.848 --> 14:54.098
You mean something other
than Gail Shaffer's shit?

14:54.100 --> 14:56.400
- This is humiliating.
- Nick, if you have the votes, then--

14:56.402 --> 14:58.235
Fucking Yonkers
and its weak mayor system.

14:58.237 --> 15:00.738
You know, even if I had control
over more of their patronage,

15:00.740 --> 15:03.324
I'd at least have a chance
of pulling more votes.

15:03.326 --> 15:05.826
But between Spallone,
Longo, and even DeLuca,

15:05.828 --> 15:06.861
<i>I'm like a fifth wheel.</i>

15:06.863 --> 15:08.696
How did
Martinelli do it?

15:08.698 --> 15:10.498
Angelo didn't have to deal
with this fucking housing nightmare.

15:10.500 --> 15:13.167
- I saw to that.
- Mr. Mayor?

15:13.169 --> 15:14.785
More good news?

15:14.787 --> 15:16.921
The Second Circuit upheld
Sand's contempt finding

15:16.923 --> 15:18.839
against the city
and the councilmen both.

15:18.841 --> 15:21.175
On the upside,
they capped the fines at a million a day,

15:21.177 --> 15:22.710
which the city
hits on day 15,

15:22.712 --> 15:24.628
and then it's a million
every day after that.

15:24.630 --> 15:27.098
So the city goes
bankrupt more slowly?

15:27.100 --> 15:28.466
How about
the Supreme Court?

15:28.468 --> 15:29.550
The Appeals Court
is counting on it.

15:29.552 --> 15:31.052
They're holding
the fines a week

15:31.054 --> 15:32.553
so we can ask
the Supremes for a stay.

15:32.555 --> 15:35.523
Okay. And what about Spallone,
Longo, Chema, Fagan?

15:35.525 --> 15:36.524
They're still in contempt?

15:36.526 --> 15:37.858
Each of them pays 500 a day.

15:37.860 --> 15:39.777
They still face jail time
beginning September 5.

15:39.779 --> 15:42.396
All right.
That's nice to think about.

15:42.398 --> 15:44.315
You know,
those four hotheads in the cooler?

15:44.317 --> 15:46.734
Maybe that'll
change some minds.

15:46.736 --> 15:48.736
What about the Supremes?
What do you think?

15:48.738 --> 15:51.288
Don't hold your breath.

15:53.409 --> 15:56.577
- All right. That's something.
- Yeah.

16:06.723 --> 16:08.506
Oh, here's the baby mayor.

16:08.508 --> 16:10.224
Wasicsko!

16:10.226 --> 16:11.926
Hey, hey, hey.

16:11.928 --> 16:13.978
No, Pete.
It's all right. Let them come.

16:13.980 --> 16:15.679
Hey, what can I
do for you?

16:15.681 --> 16:17.648
- What you can do for me--
- Come on.

16:17.650 --> 16:19.100
What you can do
for us is you can

16:19.102 --> 16:22.353
- fight the housing or resign.
- Yeah!

16:22.355 --> 16:24.238
I can't do either of those things, Jack.
I'm sorry.

16:24.240 --> 16:25.773
Yeah, that's 'cause
you're gutless.

16:25.775 --> 16:27.441
I'm sorry you feel that way.
What's your name?

16:27.443 --> 16:29.410
- Oh, like you care.
- Bobby. Bobby Amalfitano.

16:29.412 --> 16:31.362
- I live over on Nevada Avenue.
- Okay.

16:31.364 --> 16:33.614
- And I voted for you.
- We all voted for you.

16:33.616 --> 16:34.949
I trusted you.

16:34.951 --> 16:36.283
Thank you for
your vote, Bobby.

16:36.285 --> 16:37.668
Now explain to me
what I've done to let you down.

16:37.670 --> 16:39.336
Explain to you
what you've done to let me down?

16:39.338 --> 16:41.288
- Are you serious?
- You ran against the housing,

16:41.290 --> 16:43.040
and we thought
you'd fight for us.

16:43.042 --> 16:44.792
- We believed you.
- Mary, right?

16:44.794 --> 16:46.594
- Right.
- How have you been?

16:46.596 --> 16:49.380
We trusted you, and now 200
of these damn townhouses

16:49.382 --> 16:51.766
are within
walking distance of my house,

16:51.768 --> 16:53.551
- and I don't want it.
- I understand--

16:53.553 --> 16:56.020
Understand?
That's 200 families

16:56.022 --> 16:59.523
with who knows
how many in each house?

16:59.525 --> 17:02.476
- Mary, I understand your frustration.
- You don't understand!

17:02.478 --> 17:04.528
What would you do about it
if it were your neighborhood?

17:04.530 --> 17:07.397
But it's not, is it?
And if you can't fight for us,

17:07.400 --> 17:10.818
then you step aside,
just like Jack says,

17:10.819 --> 17:14.320
and make room for somebody
who is not afraid!

17:14.323 --> 17:18.325
<i>Come on, step up.</i>

17:22.882 --> 17:24.381
So I took him
to the doctor,

17:24.383 --> 17:25.665
and Dr. Chadha said
that the baby

17:25.667 --> 17:27.300
just can't be healthy
living like that,

17:27.303 --> 17:28.636
what with his bronchitis.

17:28.638 --> 17:31.172
His father had asthma real bad.
He died from it.

17:33.142 --> 17:34.975
"My patient, Jaron Watts--

17:34.977 --> 17:38.679
It is imperative that Jaron reside
in a well-ventilated home

17:38.681 --> 17:40.815
where his mother is able
to tend to his needs."

17:40.817 --> 17:42.349
Right there.
You can see.

17:48.825 --> 17:51.192
<i>No, that's a three-bedroom.</i>

17:51.194 --> 17:53.444
<i>No, that's a bedroom.</i>

17:53.446 --> 17:54.862
He called me at work
this afternoon

17:54.864 --> 17:56.497
and said he wasn't
bringing Felipe back.

17:56.499 --> 17:58.115
He's keeping him.

17:58.117 --> 18:00.167
I should've never
taken him back to DR.

18:00.169 --> 18:01.502
That was a mistake.

18:01.504 --> 18:03.254
Whatever money
I thought I could save

18:03.256 --> 18:04.371
gets used up
on long distance.

18:04.373 --> 18:08.292
And, yeah, it's better
there than here, I know!

18:08.294 --> 18:11.295
Dama, but, God,
I miss my children.

18:11.297 --> 18:12.796
I told him--

18:12.798 --> 18:16.383
I told him, "Javier,
if he's not back in 24 hours,

18:16.385 --> 18:18.469
I'm going to go down
to DR myself.

18:18.471 --> 18:20.104
And I'm gonna go
to your house

18:20.106 --> 18:22.523
and I'm gonna kill you
and all your family."

18:22.525 --> 18:24.141
- Oh, my God. Carmen--
- I told him,

18:24.143 --> 18:26.477
"People think you're crazy?
They don't know crazy.

18:26.479 --> 18:28.145
- I'm crazy."
- What did he say?

18:28.147 --> 18:29.730
He hung up on me.

18:29.732 --> 18:31.115
Imagine that.

18:35.037 --> 18:38.372
No. One thing I do know
is Felipe needs to come home.

18:38.374 --> 18:41.458
He's only five.
He belongs here with me.

18:41.460 --> 18:43.827
And when Javier refuses?

18:43.829 --> 18:46.080
I'll have to kill
his whole family.

18:46.082 --> 18:48.082
A shame, too.
I kind of liked his mother.

Well, there you have it.

When I showed that first batch
of pictures to the council meeting,

19:53.983 --> 19:56.400
there were people there
who thought I was trying to exaggerate.

19:56.402 --> 19:58.652
See for yourself.

19:58.654 --> 20:00.704
What do you expect?

20:00.706 --> 20:01.822
If you don't
respect yourself,

20:01.824 --> 20:03.707
you can't respect
anybody else.

20:03.709 --> 20:05.326
Councilman,
I spoke with Oscar Newman,

20:05.328 --> 20:06.660
and he argues that
by concentrating

20:06.662 --> 20:07.911
the poor
in projects like this,

20:07.913 --> 20:09.496
you pretty much
guaranteed the outcome.

20:09.498 --> 20:11.665
He said that by scattering
low-income housing--

20:11.667 --> 20:13.000
Yeah, I know everything
Oscar Newman said,

20:13.002 --> 20:14.468
and it doesn't work.

20:14.470 --> 20:16.053
All it takes is one
or two bad houses,

20:16.055 --> 20:18.172
and pretty soon
the whole block goes to hell.

20:18.174 --> 20:19.890
Just ask people
what happened in the Bronx.

20:19.892 --> 20:22.009
- Well, the Bronx--
- Oh, now you gonna tell me

20:22.011 --> 20:23.177
what happened in the Bronx?

20:23.179 --> 20:24.511
Don't bother.
I know. I was there.

20:24.513 --> 20:27.097
<i>♪ ...of that funky</i>
<i>go-go-go rhythm ♪</i>

20:27.099 --> 20:29.099

20:29.101 --> 20:32.019
Oscar Newman and Sussman
and that goofy judge,

20:32.021 --> 20:34.154
they don't know what the hell
they're talking about.

20:34.156 --> 20:37.358
I mean, look at it.
Look for yourself.

20:37.360 --> 20:40.327
The buildings,
the trash, the drugs...

20:40.329 --> 20:42.029
and them mutts
want to move these people

20:42.031 --> 20:44.331
to our neighborhoods
in East Yonkers.

20:44.333 --> 20:47.701
I mean, you want this
living next to you? Huh?

20:47.703 --> 20:50.037
No, goddamn right
you don't.

20:50.039 --> 20:52.706
Yeah, write that down.

20:52.708 --> 20:56.293
They don't never know how to
leave nobody alone.

20:56.295 --> 20:58.295
Anyway, I was
talking to Mambo,

20:58.297 --> 21:00.631
<i>and we're gonna go down</i>
<i>Friday night and...</i>

21:00.633 --> 21:02.716
You go to school today?

21:02.718 --> 21:05.352
I'll see you later, Billie.

21:05.354 --> 21:07.721
What you doing
home from school?

21:07.723 --> 21:09.223
Huh?

21:11.310 --> 21:13.811
I was shopping.
I been shopping.

21:18.200 --> 21:20.067
I'm not going
to school no more.

21:20.069 --> 21:22.453
Really?
No more school?

21:22.455 --> 21:24.371
And what you gonna do
instead? Shop?

21:24.373 --> 21:26.240
How long this
been going on?

21:28.327 --> 21:30.244
Girl, you tripping.

21:30.246 --> 21:32.880
All right, well, you leave school,
you need to find a job.

21:32.882 --> 21:35.582
- Ain't no free out here.
- I've been looking for a job.

21:35.584 --> 21:37.751
Well, there's plenty
of openings at the home.

21:37.753 --> 21:39.503
Working with those children
will give you a good taste

21:39.505 --> 21:40.971
of what it's
going to be like

21:40.973 --> 21:43.340
working the rest of your life
with no schooling.

21:43.342 --> 21:44.925
- I'm not going--
- You're not what, Billie?

21:44.927 --> 21:46.927
You're not working?

21:46.929 --> 21:49.930
You got another thing coming, baby girl.
You're gonna work.

21:51.600 --> 21:53.517
Hey! Leave me alone!

21:53.519 --> 21:54.568
<i>♪ so shake it ♪</i>

21:54.570 --> 21:55.986
<i>♪ your butt, shake it down ♪</i>

21:55.988 --> 21:58.355
<i>♪ we got the best music</i>
<i>all around ♪</i>

21:58.357 --> 22:00.524
<i>♪ Herb's the producer,</i>
<i>Wiz is the DJ... ♪</i>

22:06.832 --> 22:10.167
Hello?
Yeah, of course I'm awake.

22:10.169 --> 22:12.119
I had to answer
the fucking phone.

22:15.458 --> 22:16.457
Yeah?

22:19.962 --> 22:21.211
Yeah.

22:24.800 --> 22:26.383
At midnight?

22:26.385 --> 22:29.269
Oh, shit, I--

22:29.271 --> 22:31.555
I'd hoped that they
had stayed the fines until October.

22:31.557 --> 22:33.891
You know?
Give me some room to maneuver.

22:38.063 --> 22:39.446
What?

22:39.448 --> 22:42.983
Why? What was
the logic in that?

22:42.985 --> 22:45.736
Oh, all right.

22:45.738 --> 22:48.155
Uh, let me get my act
together here.

22:48.157 --> 22:49.456
I'll call you back,
all right?

22:51.043 --> 22:52.876
What happened?

22:52.878 --> 22:55.712
The Supreme Court refused to stay
the contempt finding

22:55.714 --> 22:57.464
or the fines
against the city,

22:57.466 --> 22:59.049
which now begin
at midnight.

22:59.051 --> 23:01.051
<i>Meanwhile,</i>
<i>they lifted the fines</i>

23:01.053 --> 23:03.470
on the fucking
Fantastic Four assholes

23:03.472 --> 23:05.589
until the court
can hear the case.

23:05.591 --> 23:08.642
So Spallone and them
are off the hook?

23:08.644 --> 23:11.929
I kind of imagined it was gonna be
the other way around.

23:11.931 --> 23:14.348
<i>Oh, Jesus.</i>

23:18.187 --> 23:19.353
Where are you--
where are you going?

23:19.355 --> 23:20.687
Wait, wait.

23:20.689 --> 23:22.573
I need you.
Come here.

23:24.026 --> 23:25.492
I need you now.

23:30.699 --> 23:33.200
Don't leave me.

23:33.202 --> 23:35.035
I'm not gonna leave you.

23:36.839 --> 23:39.456
No matter what happens,
all right?

23:43.546 --> 23:44.878
Okay?

23:44.880 --> 23:47.464
I'm not gonna
leave you.

23:53.389 --> 23:54.388
Let me get it.

23:54.390 --> 23:56.723
No, I'll get it.
All right.

23:56.725 --> 23:58.775
You guys wanna
get the mattress?

23:58.777 --> 24:01.812
I'll get the chairs.

24:01.814 --> 24:03.230
Thank you.

24:14.293 --> 24:17.327
Hey.

24:17.329 --> 24:19.079
What you think,
little man?

24:19.081 --> 24:22.749
Better than that
welfare motel, right?

24:22.751 --> 24:24.801
Yeah, you know it.

24:24.803 --> 24:27.804
Oh.

24:27.806 --> 24:31.308
Oh, yeah, that's right.
You're a superstar.

24:31.310 --> 24:32.926
That's right.

24:48.827 --> 24:50.944
<i>- Hi.</i>
- Thanks for coming.

24:50.946 --> 24:52.446
<i>Of course.</i>

24:52.448 --> 24:54.948
You, uh, you
got any coffee?

24:54.950 --> 24:57.751
- I even have doughnuts.
- Great.

24:57.753 --> 25:00.837
Foosball?

25:00.839 --> 25:02.122
<i>Protesters have gathered here</i>

25:02.124 --> 25:04.958
<i>at the Grinton Will Library</i>
<i>to demand its reopening.</i>

25:04.960 --> 25:07.127
<i>It was closed by</i>
<i>Mayor Wasicsko</i>

25:07.129 --> 25:09.463
<i>in compliance with</i>
<i>the state control board's</i>

25:09.465 --> 25:12.132
<i>emergency management</i>
<i>of the city's finances.</i>

25:12.134 --> 25:13.600
<i>It's bad enough
that the mayor</i>

25:13.602 --> 25:15.302
<i>is not listening</i>
<i>to people about the housing.</i>

25:15.304 --> 25:16.637
<i>And now he wants</i>
<i>to close our library?</i>

25:16.639 --> 25:18.639
Yeah, right.
Yeah, I'm closing it.

25:18.641 --> 25:19.890
<i>Enough is enough.</i>

25:19.892 --> 25:21.975
<i>This is Cristina Andrada,</i>

25:21.977 --> 25:24.311
<i>reporting live</i>
<i>from the Grinton--</i>

25:24.313 --> 25:25.979
Now enough is enough.

25:25.981 --> 25:28.615
Everything up until now was just
a walk in the fucking park.

25:28.617 --> 25:31.652
You threaten to lay off
600 workers, nobody blinks.

25:31.654 --> 25:35.622
Talk about bankrupting
the entire city? No worries.

25:35.624 --> 25:37.374
You close one library
and senior center?

25:37.376 --> 25:40.243
Did they think this
was all make-believe? Christ.

25:40.245 --> 25:41.662
Well, you know what?
He's right.

25:41.664 --> 25:43.830
When he's right, he's right.

25:43.832 --> 25:45.916
I am wrangling
four fucking votes

25:45.918 --> 25:48.335
or I'm gonna die trying.

25:48.337 --> 25:51.004
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Yeah, get me Longo.

25:51.006 --> 25:52.839
And it's Sanchez,
who goes to Rodrigo.

25:52.841 --> 25:54.675
Rodrigo back to Sanchez,

25:54.677 --> 25:56.009
<i>who forwards the ball up to Sussman.</i>

25:56.011 --> 25:57.844
Sussman, the lone
Jewish import

25:57.846 --> 26:00.147
on the team in Brazilian soccer,
and Sussman shoots.

26:00.149 --> 26:02.983
Then he scores!
It's unstoppable!

26:02.985 --> 26:06.236
Sports fans, there's no defense
for the Hebrew Hammer.

26:09.992 --> 26:11.491
I was gonna play him
for the housing plan

26:11.493 --> 26:12.659
till I saw his bank shot.

26:12.661 --> 26:15.028
He skunked me 7-0.

26:15.030 --> 26:18.248
Yeah.
I play to win, gentlemen.

26:27.092 --> 26:28.875
No, tonight.

26:28.877 --> 26:30.544
I want a vote tonight.

26:30.546 --> 26:32.546
Fuck Fagan
and Spallone already.

26:32.548 --> 26:36.216
Fuck them both.
They're lost balls in tall grass.

26:36.218 --> 26:38.719
I got me, Oxman,
and Cola. That's three.

26:38.721 --> 26:41.555
And I either pull Longo or Chema
and I ram it through.

26:41.557 --> 26:43.807
I'll shove the layoffs
and the closings in their faces

26:43.809 --> 26:47.561
and rub their fucking noses in it
until they cave.

26:47.563 --> 26:48.729
Yeah.

26:50.232 --> 26:53.400
Look, I need to round up
these guys now.

26:54.820 --> 26:55.869
I'm almost scared
to say it,

26:55.871 --> 26:57.654
but this is actually
going pretty well.

26:57.656 --> 26:59.239
Get the politicians
out of the room,

26:59.241 --> 27:00.741
the lawyers
get reasonable.

27:00.743 --> 27:03.126
Hey, I'm a politician.
Well, sort of.

27:03.128 --> 27:04.628
You're a city manager.

27:04.630 --> 27:06.546
You're, uh-- you're
only half a problem.

27:07.966 --> 27:09.883
Uh, maybe somebody
ought to tell the mayor

27:09.885 --> 27:11.585
what we've been up to.

27:11.587 --> 27:14.304
No. Now, what
we need to do

27:14.306 --> 27:16.089
is call Chemo
and Longo at home,

27:16.091 --> 27:17.140
get them down here,

27:17.142 --> 27:18.425
and see if
they'll sign off.

27:20.596 --> 27:22.262
Okay.

27:22.264 --> 27:23.597
Neither of them?
What the hell?

27:23.599 --> 27:24.765
Are they playing
ball together?

27:24.767 --> 27:25.899
I got Oxman
and I got Cola.

27:25.901 --> 27:27.150
I need three
to make a quorum.

27:27.152 --> 27:28.602
Just find these mooks.

27:28.604 --> 27:30.270
Hold on.

27:30.272 --> 27:31.405
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Yeah?

27:31.407 --> 27:33.273
- <i> Nick, It's Jim.</i>
- Yeah, Jim.

27:33.275 --> 27:34.991
<i>Look, I found them.</i>
<i>You won't believe this.</i>

27:34.993 --> 27:36.359
<i>They're at Pickelle's house.</i>

27:36.361 --> 27:37.861
What? They're where?

27:37.863 --> 27:40.163
<i>At Pickelle's house.</i>

27:40.165 --> 27:41.448
Well, did anybody
think to maybe call

27:41.450 --> 27:43.417
the goddamn mayor
of the city?

27:43.419 --> 27:44.451
Christ Almighty!

27:44.453 --> 27:46.086
Fucks!

27:48.624 --> 27:50.841
- Where to, boss?
- Wherever the fuck

27:50.843 --> 27:52.592
the government of Yonkers
is at the moment.

27:53.929 --> 27:55.512
Yeah, well,
I can't believe

27:55.514 --> 27:57.214
I might have to change
my vote after all this.

27:57.216 --> 27:58.682
I mean, how am I
supposed to do that?

27:58.684 --> 27:59.633
<i>- On your left.</i>
- Thank you.

28:01.470 --> 28:02.469
I'll call you back.

28:04.473 --> 28:06.973
Is this your conspiracy?

28:06.975 --> 28:08.942
Just trying to get the train
back on track, Nick.

28:08.944 --> 28:10.644
Yeah, right. Okay.

28:10.646 --> 28:12.813
Well, I'm done being mad,
all right?

28:12.815 --> 28:14.865
How's it going?
You got something?

28:14.867 --> 28:16.533
I thought so.
We just called the judge.

28:16.535 --> 28:18.535
He refused to hear
any compromise plan.

28:18.537 --> 28:20.654
Sand just shot us down.

28:20.656 --> 28:22.239
<i>You know, he
even surprised me.</i>

28:22.241 --> 28:24.407
He just does not want to hear
about change or compromise,

28:24.409 --> 28:26.493
not until after the city
complies with his order.

28:26.495 --> 28:28.495
<i>You know, look.</i>

28:28.497 --> 28:30.330
I thought about it,
you know. I just--

28:30.332 --> 28:31.832
I don't see what
I can do here, you know?

28:31.834 --> 28:34.050
- I promised my constituents--
- <i> Shit, people.</i>

28:34.052 --> 28:35.585
I just talked
to Gail Shaffer,

28:35.587 --> 28:38.171
and the control board
has agreed to suspend the layoffs

28:38.173 --> 28:39.923
if we vote
to comply tonight.

28:39.925 --> 28:41.224
<i>And the judge did say</i>

28:41.226 --> 28:42.175
we wouldn't have
to pay the fines

28:42.177 --> 28:43.677
for yesterday and today

28:43.679 --> 28:45.929
if the ordinance
is approved before midnight.

28:45.931 --> 28:47.347
And that's
a million-eight right there.

28:47.349 --> 28:49.266
<i>Look, there's five of us.</i>

28:49.268 --> 28:51.818
That's a quorum, right?

28:51.820 --> 28:53.854
So we go back
to the City Hall

28:53.856 --> 28:56.323
and we do our goddamn jobs.

28:56.325 --> 28:58.024
We govern.

28:58.026 --> 29:00.026
The fines may have
been overturned,

29:00.028 --> 29:02.162
but Judge Sand could still order you jailed
for contempt, Councilman.

29:02.164 --> 29:05.949
- What do you say to that?
- Judge Sand has me arrested, I'm ready.

29:05.951 --> 29:07.284
I don't go anywhere
without one.

29:07.286 --> 29:10.120
<i>Way to go, Ed.</i>

29:10.122 --> 29:12.339
There you have it
from Councilman Ed Fagan,

29:12.341 --> 29:14.124
who says he's not changing
his vote against the plan

29:14.126 --> 29:16.126
and he's not spending
any more time this weekend

29:16.128 --> 29:18.962
talking about it.

29:18.964 --> 29:20.297
<i>What else--
what else could he do?</i>

29:23.218 --> 29:24.684
<i>It's a no-brainer.</i>

29:24.686 --> 29:25.936
The Supremes leave
you guys dangling,

29:25.938 --> 29:27.137
it looks worse
changing the votes.

29:27.139 --> 29:28.772
That would look like
it was about the money.

29:28.774 --> 29:30.524
Yeah, now you could say
you came around

29:30.526 --> 29:32.392
because of the layoffs
to the other city employees.

29:32.394 --> 29:33.944
It scans way better.

29:33.946 --> 29:38.114
Come on, Nicky,
what's it gonna take for you? Huh?

29:38.116 --> 29:39.449
Pete, what about you?

29:41.153 --> 29:43.203
Look, I can't vote for this
as it stands now, right?

29:43.205 --> 29:45.038
There's got to be some
room for negotiation.

29:45.040 --> 29:46.990
Negotiation with who,
Judge Sand?

29:46.992 --> 29:48.575
Nicky, get a grip.

29:48.577 --> 29:50.160
<i>Our backs are</i>
<i>to the wall here.</i>

29:50.162 --> 29:51.745
Hank was never gonna vote for
any plan, anyway.

29:51.747 --> 29:52.913
We're better off
without him here.

29:52.915 --> 29:54.214
Yeah, Fagan neither.

29:54.216 --> 29:55.799
It comes down
to you two guys.

30:41.263 --> 30:43.763
Vote no! Vote no! Vote no!

30:43.765 --> 30:47.017
Vote no! Vote no! Vote no!

30:52.057 --> 30:53.773
Jesus Christ.
What do you think?

30:53.775 --> 30:55.141
You think Nicky and Pete
are gonna feel that?

30:55.143 --> 30:56.693
They're going to
melt into that noise?

30:56.695 --> 30:58.979
Oh, yeah.
That's gonna blow them down.

30:58.981 --> 31:01.031
All right, get me
the police commissioner.

31:03.452 --> 31:05.452
It's bad.

31:05.454 --> 31:07.487
Fucking idiots.

31:07.489 --> 31:09.072
Do you want a cup of coffee
or something?

31:09.074 --> 31:12.626
Does it look like I need
a cup of coffee right now?

31:12.628 --> 31:14.077
Yeah?

31:14.079 --> 31:16.296
Oh, for Christ's sake.

31:17.332 --> 31:18.915
How's it going?

31:22.337 --> 31:24.387
Joe, hey, look,
is it possible

31:24.389 --> 31:26.506
that we can get
the noise level down out there?

31:26.508 --> 31:28.842
It's just-- it's important it
not sound riotous.

31:28.844 --> 31:30.677
And I don't need
Pete and Nicky to get cold feet.

31:30.679 --> 31:32.062
There's no meeting
going on.

31:32.064 --> 31:33.563
If there was,
I'd have a reason.

31:35.350 --> 31:37.350
Okay.

31:39.354 --> 31:41.655
<i>Vote no! Vote no! Vote no!</i>

31:41.657 --> 31:42.856
<i>Vote no! Vote no!</i>

31:55.120 --> 31:57.837
I call to order
the meeting of Friday,

31:57.839 --> 32:00.957
September 9, 1988.

32:00.959 --> 32:02.876
Let the record reflect
that this meeting

32:02.878 --> 32:07.180
has been called
to order at 11:57.

32:07.182 --> 32:09.215
We'll now take
a 15-minute recess.

32:09.217 --> 32:11.551
I thank you
for your patience.

32:11.553 --> 32:13.136
What is he doing?

32:13.138 --> 32:15.605
<i>What is he doing?</i>

32:15.607 --> 32:17.057
<i>Hank! Hank!</i>

32:20.896 --> 32:25.482
All right. Now tell them
to go shut the fuck up.

32:25.484 --> 32:27.283
You got it.

32:30.238 --> 32:31.204
- Justice!
- When do we want it?

32:31.206 --> 32:32.489
Now!

32:32.491 --> 32:34.124
- What do we want?
- Justice!

32:34.126 --> 32:36.042
- When do we want it?
- Now!

32:36.044 --> 32:37.627
- What do we want?
- Justice!

32:37.629 --> 32:39.079
- When do we want it?
- Now!

32:39.081 --> 32:40.880
What do we want?

32:40.882 --> 32:42.632
Hey, man!
Fuck you, pig!

32:45.220 --> 32:46.886
Ladies and gentlemen?

32:46.888 --> 32:48.388
Ladies and gentlemen,

32:48.390 --> 32:50.673
the council meeting
is in session.

32:50.675 --> 32:53.676
So, if you persist,
I'm going to have to ask you to move

32:53.678 --> 32:56.396
300 yards
from the premises

32:56.398 --> 32:58.648
so that the council
can conduct its business.

32:58.650 --> 33:01.184
Fuck you!
Go fuck yourself, you motherfucker!

33:01.186 --> 33:04.320
Get him out of here.
Get that guy out of here.

33:12.948 --> 33:15.749
- 630 layoffs.
- Jesus Christ.

33:15.751 --> 33:18.785
That's right.
The cost is real, guys.

33:18.787 --> 33:20.787
There's no more
bullshitting ourselves.

33:25.460 --> 33:26.843
He's right, Pete.

33:26.845 --> 33:28.628
We're about to go
from martyrs to murderers.

33:28.630 --> 33:32.799
<i>We're about to</i>
<i>economically murder 630 families.</i>

33:32.801 --> 33:34.467
<i>Oh, look at this.</i>

33:34.469 --> 33:36.970
Oh, my God.

33:36.972 --> 33:38.054
I mean,
these are people

33:38.056 --> 33:41.141
I shared backyard
barbecues with.

33:41.143 --> 33:42.475
I attended
their weddings,

33:42.477 --> 33:43.693
the christenings
of their children

33:43.695 --> 33:46.479
not as their councilman,
but as their friend.

33:46.481 --> 33:48.815
I'm gonna be sick.

33:52.988 --> 33:54.704
What do you think
about all this?

33:54.706 --> 33:55.905
To be honest,
I can't believe

33:55.907 --> 33:57.574
this is happening
in Yonkers.

33:57.576 --> 33:59.292
After all
we've been through,

33:59.294 --> 34:01.995
to have a day like this
and a night like this?

34:01.997 --> 34:03.797
- I mean, I just don't...
<i>- Give 'em hell, Hank!</i>

34:03.799 --> 34:06.466
You bet I will.
You bet I will!

34:06.468 --> 34:08.251
I'll fight
for the city.

34:08.253 --> 34:10.553
<i>Vote no! Vote no! Vote no!</i>

34:10.554 --> 34:12.922
<i>Vote no! Vote no! Vote no!</i>

34:31.359 --> 34:33.025
<i>Traitor!</i>

34:33.027 --> 34:35.745
<i>You're all
going to rot in hell!</i>

34:35.746 --> 34:38.697
I'm calling this recessed
meeting back to order.

34:39.868 --> 34:42.702
I want to thank everybody
for their patience.

34:42.704 --> 34:44.370
I want to remind everybody

34:44.371 --> 34:47.422
that this is the most
important council meeting

34:47.425 --> 34:49.792
I think that the City
of Yonkers has ever had,

34:49.793 --> 34:52.045
- and I'm going to demand that--
<i>- You chickenshit!</i>

34:52.047 --> 34:55.047
I'm going to demand
that everybody

34:55.050 --> 34:58.351
in, uh, the audience be
respectful of the councilmen

34:58.353 --> 35:00.136
as they conduct
their business.

35:00.138 --> 35:04.224
And I have directed
your police commissioner to ensure that.

35:04.226 --> 35:06.359
Mr. Longo, do you wish
to speak on the item?

35:06.361 --> 35:09.812
- Yes, thank you, Mr. Mayor.
<i>- Oh, God, no!</i>

35:09.814 --> 35:13.483
Uh, this is, uh...

35:13.485 --> 35:15.235
This is not
a very pleasant time

35:15.237 --> 35:17.620
for anyone who
serves in government.

35:19.291 --> 35:20.490
Ladies and gentlemen,
please.

35:21.660 --> 35:22.909
For anyone who--

35:22.911 --> 35:24.544
for anyone who serves
in the government

35:24.546 --> 35:25.578
in the City of Yonkers.

35:25.580 --> 35:27.580
Or for anyone who lives
in this city!

35:27.582 --> 35:30.583
Ladies and gentlemen, please.

35:30.585 --> 35:32.835
It seems to me
that we have

35:32.837 --> 35:35.922
no alternative
at this point

35:35.924 --> 35:40.677
but to adopt the ordinance
as is and contin--

35:40.679 --> 35:44.180
<i>Longo, you piece of garbage!</i>

35:45.567 --> 35:47.517
We did not vote
the consent decree because--

35:47.519 --> 35:49.686
<i>It was fine the day
before, you stinking bastard!</i>

35:49.688 --> 35:51.988
<i>We fight! No way!</i>

35:53.775 --> 35:57.360
<i>Nicky, you no-good...</i>

36:01.032 --> 36:02.999
Roll call vote,
Mr. Clerk.

36:08.590 --> 36:11.007
- <i> Mayor Wasicsko?</i>
- Yes.

36:11.009 --> 36:13.626
- <i> Vice Mayor Spallone?</i>
- No.

36:13.628 --> 36:15.628
<i>Majority Leader Cola?</i>

36:15.630 --> 36:16.963
Yes.

36:16.965 --> 36:19.799
- <i> Minority Leader Longo?</i>
- Yes.

36:19.801 --> 36:22.435
- <i> Councilman Fagan?</i>
- No.

36:22.437 --> 36:26.306
- <i> Councilman Chema?</i>
- Yes.

36:26.308 --> 36:29.309
- <i> Councilman Oxman?</i>
- Yes.

36:29.311 --> 36:32.562
Five ayes and two nays.
The ordinance passes.

36:38.820 --> 36:40.958
<i>How could you
do this to us?</i>

36:43.291 --> 36:45.992
- Stay back.
- <i> Shame on you, Mayor! Shame on you!</i>

36:56.755 --> 36:58.588
What's the matter
with these people?

37:00.725 --> 37:03.849
- Mr. Mayor, you need to go!
- It's okay, sweetie.

37:06.348 --> 37:08.231
Jesus Christ.

37:10.101 --> 37:12.769
Come on, you guys.

37:20.195 --> 37:23.613
<i>The clerk
will call the roll.</i>

37:23.615 --> 37:26.833
The clerk
will call the roll.

37:26.835 --> 37:30.119
<i>The clerk will call</i>
<i>the roll.</i>

37:35.043 --> 37:37.260
It's okay.
It's all right.

37:45.687 --> 37:48.021
Ma?

37:48.023 --> 37:49.605
It's me, Mom.

37:49.607 --> 37:51.858
<i>Yeah, I'm in here.</i>

37:57.032 --> 37:58.448
Where's the health aide?

37:58.450 --> 38:00.400
She's supposed to start
this week, right?

38:00.402 --> 38:04.237
I waited all day yesterday,
and she never showed up.

38:04.239 --> 38:05.788
So I called her agency,

38:05.790 --> 38:10.126
and they said
she couldn't find the apartment.

38:10.128 --> 38:11.878
What?

38:11.880 --> 38:14.964
I think someone's
telling stories somewhere.

38:14.966 --> 38:17.917
Well, are they sending someone else,
somebody with a map?

38:17.919 --> 38:21.337
They said so,
but nobody so far today.

38:21.339 --> 38:25.174
See, these places are certified
by the government.

38:25.176 --> 38:27.510
They got to
follow the rules.

38:27.512 --> 38:28.928
Where's their number?

38:28.930 --> 38:30.396
In the kitchen.

38:30.398 --> 38:32.315
I'll call them.

38:36.855 --> 38:39.939
Ain't no way.
I'm not going back there.

38:39.941 --> 38:43.659
Not with that boy.
Nah, I'm quitting.

38:43.661 --> 38:45.862
You took the job.
You can't just walk away.

38:45.864 --> 38:47.613
Do you like doing
this every day?

38:47.615 --> 38:49.832
I do what needs doing.

38:49.834 --> 38:52.418
How many people in the world
you think get up every day

38:52.420 --> 38:55.004
and do what it is
they like doing?

38:55.006 --> 38:56.339
Some.

38:56.341 --> 38:57.457
And how many
of those people

38:57.459 --> 38:58.875
do you think
live in Schlobohm?

38:58.877 --> 39:01.594
Or School Street?
That's what a job is, Billie.

39:01.596 --> 39:03.963
I don't care.
I'm not going back there.

39:03.965 --> 39:05.631
I'm not washing that boy.

39:05.633 --> 39:07.016
Him in the tub,

39:07.018 --> 39:09.051
banging his retarded
fucking head against the wall,

39:09.053 --> 39:10.887
water going everywhere,
him screaming.

39:10.889 --> 39:13.723
This is the real world, girl.

39:13.725 --> 39:15.608
Live with it!

39:17.645 --> 39:19.145
You live with it.

39:19.147 --> 39:20.696
What did you say?

39:22.984 --> 39:26.736
- Nothing.
- Mm. That's what I thought.

39:28.490 --> 39:30.490
<i>Call for American
Airlines flight 953...</i>

39:30.492 --> 39:31.908
What is taking so long?

39:31.910 --> 39:34.827
<i>...now boarding</i>
<i>at gate six.</i>

39:36.381 --> 39:37.964
<i>Boarding call</i>
<i>for flight 953...</i>

39:37.966 --> 39:40.583
What are we going to do
if he doesn't come?

39:40.585 --> 39:42.335
Just calm down.

39:42.337 --> 39:43.336
I don't know.

39:43.338 --> 39:45.087
My God...

39:47.642 --> 39:48.758
<i>Felipe!</i>

39:51.312 --> 39:54.931
<i>American Airlines
passenger Mary Jane Donahoe,</i>

39:54.933 --> 39:57.016
<i>please report to</i>
<i>the information desk.</i>

39:57.018 --> 39:58.351
- Give me a kiss.
- <i> Thank you.</i>

40:00.321 --> 40:04.106
<i>American Airlines
passenger Mary Jane Donahoe...</i>

40:04.108 --> 40:05.525
Are you okay?

40:07.078 --> 40:09.529
I'm sorry. This is not
the court's problem.

40:09.531 --> 40:12.865
Your Honor,
you saw what it took

40:12.867 --> 40:14.534
to get the consent
of the city council

40:14.536 --> 40:17.537
to even a general statement
of compliance with the court.

40:17.539 --> 40:20.256
I am asking you,
in the name of all that is holy,

40:20.258 --> 40:23.543
to please name a replacement location
for the housing units

40:23.545 --> 40:27.547
that were formerly sited
at the St. Joseph's Seminary.

40:27.549 --> 40:29.882
Been quite a year
for you, Mr. Mayor.

40:32.053 --> 40:34.470
Uh, yeah,
you could say that.

40:34.472 --> 40:37.857
And now you're facing a reelection campaign
just around the corner.

40:37.859 --> 40:39.976
Two-year terms.
What fun.

40:39.978 --> 40:42.528
Well, my best wishes
to you going forward, Mr. Wasicsko.

40:42.530 --> 40:44.030
Thank you, Your Honor.

40:44.032 --> 40:45.898
But let's keep
those sentiments to ourselves.

40:45.900 --> 40:47.867
You know,
your endorsement doesn't exactly

40:47.869 --> 40:50.119
bring out the vote
in the City of Yonkers.

40:50.121 --> 40:52.488
Justice is not about popularity.

40:52.490 --> 40:55.791
No, it's not,
but politics is.

40:59.581 --> 41:01.297
Please?

41:01.299 --> 41:05.551
Well, since the Yonkers City Council
again refuses to act

41:05.553 --> 41:07.053
<i>and Mayor Wasicsko</i>
<i>has asked that I take</i>

41:07.055 --> 41:09.388
the decision out
of the city's hands,

41:09.390 --> 41:12.225
I am formally picking
the Gramercy location

41:12.227 --> 41:15.678
as the replacement for
the St. Joseph's Seminary site.

41:15.680 --> 41:17.597
Thank you, Judge.

41:17.599 --> 41:19.565
Your Honor, if I might?

41:19.567 --> 41:21.350
<i>Mr. Newman.</i>

41:21.352 --> 41:23.519
<i>I realize our
options are limited here,</i>

41:23.521 --> 41:25.571
but there's a number of problems
on the Gramercy location

41:25.573 --> 41:26.772
I feel I have
to bring up.

41:26.774 --> 41:28.741
- Bring up again.
- Again.

41:28.743 --> 41:30.860
First off, because
only seven sites

41:30.862 --> 41:33.696
are apparently all that's ever
going to be available to us,

41:33.698 --> 41:36.032
as many as 48 townhouses
will have to be built

41:36.034 --> 41:37.500
- on the Gramercy site.
- And?

41:37.502 --> 41:39.785
And my research shows
that crime increases

41:39.787 --> 41:41.921
with the number of units
in a housing project.

41:41.923 --> 41:44.790
I've tried to limit that number
to a maximum of 24 per site.

41:44.792 --> 41:46.459
Now we're looking
at twice that.

41:46.461 --> 41:48.461
Oscar, you're fighting
the last war.

41:48.463 --> 41:51.264
But consider this,
because of the configuration of this site,

41:51.266 --> 41:53.599
putting that number
of townhouses here

41:53.601 --> 41:55.468
will require an internal
road system be built

41:55.470 --> 41:57.470
at a significantly
increased cost.

41:57.472 --> 42:01.474
Well, as I've said, any increase in cost
beyond the HUD guideline

42:01.476 --> 42:02.975
<i>is going to have</i>
<i>to be borne by the city.</i>

42:02.977 --> 42:04.226
Here's my real worry.

42:04.228 --> 42:05.811
On the Gramercy site,

42:05.813 --> 42:07.980
I can't make
the townhouses disappear

42:07.982 --> 42:09.949
into the fabric
of the middle-class neighborhoods.

42:09.951 --> 42:11.117
It's too isolated.

42:11.119 --> 42:12.785
And my concern
is that isolation

42:12.787 --> 42:14.870
will allow
a criminal element to flourish

42:14.872 --> 42:17.907
<i>that the public housing</i>
<i>residents alone can't control.</i>

42:17.909 --> 42:19.492
Oscar, you're
fearmongering,

42:19.494 --> 42:21.961
and it reflects
your ideological baggage.

42:21.963 --> 42:24.380
I got to tell you this is--
it's basically racist.

42:24.382 --> 42:25.998
<i>What's so
difficult about this?</i>

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
The smaller the site,
the greater the contact,

42:28.002 --> 42:29.218
the more the
middle-class neighbor

42:29.220 --> 42:31.220
is going to exert
their values and control.

42:31.222 --> 42:33.673
Simple as that.

42:33.675 --> 42:36.342
We are going
to build these houses.

42:36.344 --> 42:39.228
<i>The judge and the council vote</i>
<i>have seen to that.</i>

42:39.230 --> 42:44.400
But let me ask,
do we want this to succeed or not?

42:47.689 --> 42:49.188
<i>She just knows.</i>

42:49.190 --> 42:51.190
<i>Knows if I'm late,</i>
<i>if I take the day off,</i>

42:51.192 --> 42:52.441
if I go home early.

42:52.443 --> 42:55.077
I really don't get it.
Just tell her.

42:55.079 --> 42:56.779
She's not gonna let me quit
no matter what,

42:56.781 --> 42:58.364
not unless I go
back to school.

42:58.366 --> 43:00.833
So what are you gonna do?

43:00.835 --> 43:03.202
I got to get my ass
fired somehow.

43:03.204 --> 43:04.620
<i>Ladies, ladies.</i>

43:04.622 --> 43:06.756
Hey, Hot Stuff.

43:06.758 --> 43:10.009
Hot, this is Billie.

43:10.011 --> 43:12.044
John my real name.

43:12.046 --> 43:14.347
Anyone for a beer?

43:14.349 --> 43:16.132
I'll take mine
in a glass.

43:16.134 --> 43:17.967
Glass, huh?

43:20.304 --> 43:22.388
- <i> Meeka, you?</i>
- A bottle is fine.

43:35.536 --> 43:37.570
I talked to
Miss Clarkson myself.

43:39.157 --> 43:40.322
You should've asked her

43:40.324 --> 43:42.742
to send a Jamaican
health aide.

43:42.744 --> 43:45.494
Those old Jamaicans
don't scare.

43:47.081 --> 43:49.665
I'm sure she's
just running late.

What is it
with Yonkers?

45:06.711 --> 45:09.044
It's like that--
that game where you--

45:09.046 --> 45:11.997
you hit the animal that--
where it keeps popping up?

45:11.999 --> 45:13.883
- Whac-A-Mole?
- That's it.

45:13.885 --> 45:17.002
Every time I resolve one problem,
another one jumps up.

45:17.004 --> 45:19.588
But this-- insisting on two
apartment walk-ups

45:19.590 --> 45:23.259
rather than single-family homes
is just so shortsighted.

45:23.261 --> 45:26.095
Mr. Smith, does the city
housing authority agree?

45:26.097 --> 45:29.682
Yes, Your Honor. We've bought
Oscar's "Defensible Space" theory.

45:29.684 --> 45:30.850
<i>We believe</i>
<i>it's the way to go.</i>

45:30.852 --> 45:32.485
Well, then what
is HUD's objection?

45:32.487 --> 45:35.938
Cost. They think it'll be more expensive
to build the townhouses.

45:35.940 --> 45:37.273
And it may well be.

45:37.275 --> 45:39.325
But the idea of walk-ups
just flies in the face

45:39.327 --> 45:42.027
of everything I've tried
to bring to this project.

45:42.029 --> 45:44.697
There can be no
interior public areas.

45:44.699 --> 45:47.116
No stairs to a second unit.
Nothing.

45:47.118 --> 45:49.869
And every family must have
its own front and rear yards,

45:49.871 --> 45:52.705
and the front entry
must be directly off the street.

45:52.707 --> 45:54.540
Why the hell
can't they see that?

45:54.542 --> 45:56.592
Cost can be a prohibitive
hurdle, Oscar,

45:56.594 --> 45:57.760
even for the government.

45:57.762 --> 45:59.044
<i>Public housing residents</i>

45:59.046 --> 46:01.514
<i>are no different than</i>
<i>any other renters.</i>

46:01.516 --> 46:03.682
They will jealously guard
and maintain what's theirs.

46:03.684 --> 46:07.102
Problems arise when projects have
nebulous public areas

46:07.104 --> 46:09.638
that are like a
sort of no-man's-land.

46:09.640 --> 46:11.557
That's the place
that gets trashed.

46:11.559 --> 46:13.392
<i>That's the space</i>
<i>that gets used for</i>

46:13.394 --> 46:15.277
loitering and drug dealing.

46:16.397 --> 46:20.399
You know, every year
HUD spends millions

46:20.401 --> 46:22.868
repairing the vandalism
done in the public areas

46:22.870 --> 46:25.404
of the high-rises
and the walk-ups.

46:25.406 --> 46:27.122
<i>It's a given.</i>
<i>It's in the budget.</i>

46:27.124 --> 46:28.741
- And?
- <i> And...</i>

46:28.743 --> 46:31.076
I'm just wondering
if an argument can be made

46:31.078 --> 46:34.747
that the townhouses
would be cheaper in the long run.

46:34.749 --> 46:36.549
<i>I mean, without</i>
<i>the public areas,</i>

46:36.551 --> 46:38.050
<i>we don't have</i>

46:38.052 --> 46:39.251
<i>of maintenance</i>
<i>and security.</i>

For real?

46:57.238 --> 46:59.488
Well, he wasn't
my real father.

46:59.490 --> 47:02.241
I mean,
my real father walked out

47:02.243 --> 47:04.276
before I was born,

47:04.278 --> 47:06.328
but I called him
my father.

47:06.330 --> 47:09.198
I didn't find out till
a couple of years ago he wasn't.

47:09.200 --> 47:11.784
He walked out, too,
when I was 12.

47:13.120 --> 47:15.120
I would never
do that to my son.

47:15.122 --> 47:17.122
You have a son?

47:17.124 --> 47:20.292
Yeah. He's named Noel.

47:20.294 --> 47:24.046
- He was born on Christmas.
- Oh.

47:24.048 --> 47:26.465
I don't see his mother
no more, though.

47:26.467 --> 47:28.100
She wanted to
get married.

47:28.102 --> 47:30.302
I told her I was too young
for that stuff.

47:30.304 --> 47:32.438
She thought
I was older.

47:34.392 --> 47:36.642

Deluxe Homes of Berwick,
Pennsylvania,

48:20.071 --> 48:22.855
has the low bid
for the first 142 units.

48:22.857 --> 48:25.691
The good news is that
they'll be built out of state.

48:25.693 --> 48:27.526
That eliminates
any potential trouble

48:27.528 --> 48:29.662
like threats,
protests, vandalism.

48:29.664 --> 48:33.248
So the prefab units
will be trucked into Yonkers?

48:33.250 --> 48:36.201
And then literally bolted onto
the foundations here.

48:36.203 --> 48:38.587
The bad news is
the bid came in

48:38.589 --> 48:40.873
five million more
than what we have.

48:40.875 --> 48:44.460
Under HUD's guidelines
we have 11.3 million available.

48:44.462 --> 48:46.845
Deluxe came in at 16.1.

48:46.847 --> 48:49.131
That's about
$33,000 a unit.

48:49.133 --> 48:53.268
Mayor Wasicsko has raised the shortfall
possibility with HUD, as have we.

48:53.270 --> 48:56.689
Also, Senator Moynihan
has started working back channels for us,

48:56.691 --> 49:00.309
and Jack Kemp has told him that
he will find a way to make this happen.

49:00.311 --> 49:03.062
Believe it or not,
we have a pretty good relationship

49:03.064 --> 49:04.863
- with Secretary's office.
- With such open lines,

49:04.865 --> 49:07.399
you would have thought the last War
of the Walk-ups could have been avoided.

49:07.401 --> 49:12.321
Well, Your Honor, sometimes
the magic works, sometimes it doesn't.

49:12.323 --> 49:15.741
The important thing is
HUD made the right call despite themselves

49:15.743 --> 49:17.659
and we're finally on track.

49:17.661 --> 49:19.244
It's all a technical
problem now, right?

49:19.246 --> 49:20.245
The politics is done.

49:23.334 --> 49:24.800
Which is why I'm here today

49:24.802 --> 49:26.919
to announce that I am running
for Mayor of Yonkers.

49:28.172 --> 49:31.340
Never before
has the opportunity been so right

49:31.342 --> 49:33.759
to bring about meaningful
political reform...

49:33.761 --> 49:36.595
And I will restore
the government of Yonkers

49:36.597 --> 49:37.763
to the people's government!

49:39.400 --> 49:41.433
Yonkers is at a crossroads.

49:41.435 --> 49:43.352
Together we can
return Yonkers

49:43.354 --> 49:45.020
to a city
of gracious living.

49:45.022 --> 49:47.239
I am asking
that you return me

49:47.241 --> 49:48.690
to a second term
as your mayor.

49:48.692 --> 49:51.160
And this mayor,
who has been shortsighted

49:51.162 --> 49:53.829
in handling the whole thing,

49:53.831 --> 49:57.082
he has shown
absolutely no compassion

49:57.084 --> 50:00.002
for either the homeowners
or the people of Yonkers.

50:02.123 --> 50:05.374
And I also ask that you reject
the four councilmen

50:05.376 --> 50:07.676
who caused our city
to be held in contempt

50:07.678 --> 50:10.846
and any candidate
who would support it.

50:10.848 --> 50:12.214
Let's clean up City Hall.

50:13.350 --> 50:17.186
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

50:46.967 --> 50:50.669
<i>I didn't plan it this way.</i>

50:50.671 --> 50:53.672
<i>Truth is, my daddy says</i>
<i>I didn't plan anything--</i>

50:53.674 --> 50:55.674
<i>that it's because</i>
<i>I didn't have a plan</i>

50:55.676 --> 50:58.477
<i>that you and me</i>
<i>are in this mess.</i>

50:58.479 --> 51:00.813
<i>But I know that isn't true.</i>

51:00.815 --> 51:02.681
<i>I loved your daddy,</i>
<i>and I wanted you</i>

51:02.683 --> 51:03.899

51:03.901 --> 51:06.401
<i>to come from that love.</i>

<i>And I don't have</i>

51:09.857 --> 51:11.440
<i>People who say</i>
<i>that isn't a plan</i>

51:11.442 --> 51:13.859
<i>don't know my heart.</i>

51:13.861 --> 51:18.864
<i>What I didn't plan</i>
<i>was for being alone so fast.</i>

51:18.866 --> 51:20.866
<i>I knew what</i>
<i>having a kid meant,</i>

51:20.868 --> 51:23.869
<i>that it was all kinds</i>
<i>of responsibility.</i>

51:23.871 --> 51:27.789
<i>But I thought I'd be</i>
<i>doing it with your daddy</i>

51:27.791 --> 51:31.877
<i>and every day would be</i>
<i>a little bit better.</i>

51:31.879 --> 51:34.213
<i>I thought if I could</i>

<i>"...and I don't know</i>
