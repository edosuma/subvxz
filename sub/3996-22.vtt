WEBVTT

00:01.671 --> 00:04.038
Thank you guys for joining me
on this momentous day.

00:04.407 --> 00:06.541
As you guys know, it's been
kind of a rough year for me.

00:06.609 --> 00:08.143
I got dumped by Caroline,

00:08.211 --> 00:09.377
then Julia.

00:09.445 --> 00:10.612
I opened myself up to love,

00:10.679 --> 00:11.946
I was hurt badly,

00:12.014 --> 00:13.248
and I closed myself up again.

00:15.017 --> 00:16.850
The downstairs neighbor put
a password on their Wi-Fi...

00:16.918 --> 00:18.519
- Off topic. Off-putting.
- Okay. I agree.

00:18.587 --> 00:19.820
So I've decided...

00:20.387 --> 00:21.888
to give up on women,

00:21.956 --> 00:23.824
and put all
that energy into...

00:24.641 --> 00:25.759
tomatoes!

00:25.827 --> 00:27.128
You know what?
It was on us

00:27.195 --> 00:28.662
for thinking this
wasn't gonna be stupid.

00:28.730 --> 00:29.530
Thank God! I thought he was
trying to sell us something.

00:29.598 --> 00:31.432
Guys, I have a whole speech!

00:31.500 --> 00:32.732
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, you guys.

00:32.799 --> 00:34.800
I told him not
to lead with tomatoes,

00:34.868 --> 00:36.436
but he did.

00:36.504 --> 00:38.138
As his friends, don't
you want to know why

00:38.205 --> 00:40.173
he wants to plant tomatoes?

00:40.241 --> 00:42.208
Is it because
he wants tomatoes?

00:42.276 --> 00:43.909
This is my feeble attempt
at a new beginning.

00:43.977 --> 00:45.711
He's sowing the seeds
for a more fruitful tomorrow.

00:45.779 --> 00:47.246
He is turning over
a new leaf. He is...

00:47.313 --> 00:48.980
Jess, please don't do
plant metaphors right now.

00:48.981 --> 00:50.682
- Okay, I'll trim it back a little bit.
- Okay, but you did it again.

00:50.750 --> 00:52.651
- It's just ripe with plant metaphors.
- Okay, but stop.

00:52.718 --> 00:54.453
I'm looking at you guys,
and I'm realizing

00:54.521 --> 00:56.054
that there's a
possibility of happiness.

00:56.122 --> 00:57.756
He's looking for a
little dapple of sunlight.

00:57.823 --> 00:59.458
- Go.
- Sorry.

00:59.526 --> 01:02.761
Winston and Shelby, you guys
have obviously found love, so...

01:02.828 --> 01:04.361
No, you have no idea.

01:04.429 --> 01:06.096
No, I do, 'cause you talk
about it all the time.

01:06.165 --> 01:07.831
- I think we all have a pretty good idea.
- Pretty clear idea.

01:08.899 --> 01:11.502
Schmidt and Cece, you almost
made a baby together.

01:11.570 --> 01:14.405
You almost made a person.
Think about that!

01:14.473 --> 01:15.673
Jess...

01:15.740 --> 01:16.874
you're dating the man that

01:16.941 --> 01:18.142
I could see myself
growing old with.

01:18.210 --> 01:19.610
Russell, you got
a great-looking face.

01:19.678 --> 01:21.110
Your jawline could cut glass.

01:21.179 --> 01:22.479
Hold on tight, sister.

01:22.547 --> 01:23.513
Don't let that one
slip away.

01:23.581 --> 01:24.481
It's getting
a little weird, Nick.

01:24.549 --> 01:25.582
So, without
further ado...

01:26.350 --> 01:28.618
Water, the source of life.

01:30.588 --> 01:31.521
Whoa!

01:31.589 --> 01:33.223
(everyone groaning,
grumbling

01:33.291 --> 01:34.224
It's okay, I got two of them.

01:34.292 --> 01:35.625
You know what?

01:35.693 --> 01:36.525
Go downstairs,
if you want!

01:36.593 --> 01:38.294
I don't care!

01:38.361 --> 01:39.395
I got the tomatoes
and I'm bettin' on me!

01:39.462 --> 01:40.996
Freeze frame!

01:41.064 --> 01:43.334
When I'm up in the air
and the legs are there.

01:55.744 --> 01:59.013
Cece, the Jewish is
here to make sex.

01:59.081 --> 02:01.349
Uh, it's actually Schmidt.

02:01.417 --> 02:03.685
Um, we've met, uh, many times.

02:03.752 --> 02:07.154
Right. I hear you make
sex through Cece wall.

02:07.223 --> 02:09.622
You sound like dog
being stepped on.

02:09.691 --> 02:12.158
(barking weakly)

02:12.227 --> 02:14.595
Any noises I make, they come
from a very truthful place.

02:14.662 --> 02:16.530
I like to create a free
environment in the sack.

02:16.598 --> 02:17.664
Hey.

02:17.732 --> 02:18.699
What's going on here?

02:18.766 --> 02:20.166
I like his face.

02:20.235 --> 02:22.135
I want to punch,
punch, punch!

02:23.104 --> 02:24.837
Beautiful women...

02:24.904 --> 02:26.672
you guys can say just about
anything, can't you?

02:26.740 --> 02:29.442
So what are you doing here?
So, look, we've barely spoken

02:29.509 --> 02:32.245
since I almost impregnated you.

02:32.312 --> 02:33.879
You know, it's just,
it's this whole thing

02:33.947 --> 02:35.281
has just kind of
got me thinking.

02:35.349 --> 02:37.683
Maybe this is
just too intense,

02:37.751 --> 02:40.018
and we should stop.

02:42.020 --> 02:43.355
That's what you want?

02:43.422 --> 02:45.290
It's how I feel right now,
so, yeah.

02:45.358 --> 02:47.459
Oh... Coolio.

02:47.526 --> 02:49.994
So he goes out with me.

02:51.062 --> 02:51.896
Oh, Nadia,
I think that...

02:51.964 --> 02:53.231
I think that's
a great idea.

02:53.299 --> 02:55.533
I mean, that's what
you want, right?

02:55.601 --> 02:57.768
Yeah. It's great.
Totally cool with me.

02:57.835 --> 02:59.870
NADIA:
Yay! We have fun.

02:59.937 --> 03:02.005
I make him put on black shawl,

03:02.073 --> 03:04.074
pretend he's grandma.

03:06.311 --> 03:07.778
SCHMIDT:
<i>Fine, twist my arm.</i>

03:07.845 --> 03:09.647
I'll go out with the
hot Russian model

03:09.714 --> 03:11.749
whose ancestors
probably burned down

03:11.816 --> 03:13.115
my ancestors' village.

03:13.183 --> 03:14.850
Something weird happened
to me today.

03:14.918 --> 03:18.856
I was at Russell's gym, and I
ran into his ex-wife Ouli.

03:20.424 --> 03:22.224
Jess, hi!

03:22.293 --> 03:24.494
- Ouli!
- Oh, that's a great swimsuit.

03:24.561 --> 03:27.263
Thank you.

03:27.331 --> 03:29.564
Wow, someone's been working out.

03:29.632 --> 03:31.166
You back's like
a bag of ropes.

03:31.233 --> 03:33.335
Oh, mama.

03:33.403 --> 03:35.036
It was really foggy

03:35.104 --> 03:37.606
and I kept making eye contact
with her nipples,

03:37.674 --> 03:39.974
and then I panicked and I
invited her to dinner

03:40.042 --> 03:41.242
with Russell and me tonight.

03:41.311 --> 03:42.311
- What?
- You did what?!

03:42.378 --> 03:43.545
It's just that, like, Ouli is

03:43.613 --> 03:44.812
like this looming presence,

03:44.879 --> 03:46.314
and we don't talk about it,

03:46.381 --> 03:47.515
and I don't know,

03:47.582 --> 03:49.784
I thought it would be,
like, good for us.

03:49.851 --> 03:51.686
- Everything okay with Russell?
- Everything's fine.

03:51.753 --> 03:53.454
I know it's gonna be
tense at first,

03:53.522 --> 03:54.922
'cause Ouli's no
Russell's favorite person,

03:54.989 --> 03:57.057
but I grew up with
divorced parents,

03:57.125 --> 04:00.060
and I'm really good at
navigating these situations.

04:00.128 --> 04:01.895
- What did I do?
- Nothing!

04:03.698 --> 04:05.398

04:12.155 --> 04:13.573
Don't tap-dance at dinner.

04:13.641 --> 04:15.608
Do you really think I would
tap-dance at dinner?

04:15.676 --> 04:17.076
Yes. I'm hiding
your tap shoes, Jess.

04:17.144 --> 04:18.043
- Absolutely.
- I'm with Schmidt. Don't do it.

04:19.046 --> 04:20.411
OULI:
Hi.

04:20.480 --> 04:21.613
Hi. I'm sorry I'm late.

04:21.680 --> 04:23.249
- Hi!
- Hi!

04:23.317 --> 04:24.483
Hey, remember
last time

04:24.551 --> 04:25.517
we were hugging?

04:26.085 --> 04:27.053
You were naked.

04:27.120 --> 04:28.187
That was weird.

04:28.255 --> 04:29.355
No!

04:29.422 --> 04:30.923
No, that's not weird at all.

04:31.391 --> 04:32.991
I have no problem
being naked.

04:34.059 --> 04:35.426
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:37.162 --> 04:39.130
How are the "quethadillath"?

04:39.698 --> 04:41.233
You know what?
I've actually never had them.

04:41.300 --> 04:42.667
Oh, the eye roll.

04:42.735 --> 04:44.302
Mm. Miss that.

04:44.370 --> 04:45.937
I didn't actually
roll my eyes.

04:46.005 --> 04:47.572
I just needed to quickly
stare at the ceiling.

04:48.640 --> 04:50.107
Hey, Ouli...

04:50.175 --> 04:51.175
Mm...

04:51.743 --> 04:53.077
I love your name.

04:53.144 --> 04:54.411
Thank you.

04:54.479 --> 04:56.981
Or should I say, <i>"grathiath"?</i>

05:00.285 --> 05:02.052
Uh...

05:02.120 --> 05:03.420
Oh.

05:08.831 --> 05:10.098
- Well, this is fun.
- Yeah.

05:10.366 --> 05:12.167
It is.

05:12.234 --> 05:13.801
Should we get, like, eight more
of these, right?

05:13.869 --> 05:15.203
("Cielito Lindo" begins)

05:15.271 --> 05:17.172
- I love this song.
- Oh, I hate this song.

05:19.341 --> 05:21.242
When we were on vacation
in Oaxaca,

05:21.310 --> 05:23.743
Ouli hummed this song for,
like, an eight-hour drive.

05:23.811 --> 05:24.678
Well, it wouldn't have
been eight hours

05:24.745 --> 05:26.380
if you hadn't gotten lost.

05:26.448 --> 05:28.315
At one point, we were just
following some donkeys.

05:28.383 --> 05:30.584
Oh, my gosh!
Look, it's food!

05:30.651 --> 05:32.786
- I love food.
- They were not donkeys!

05:32.853 --> 05:33.920
I can't even remember what

05:33.988 --> 05:35.021
we were talking about.

05:35.090 --> 05:35.989
It wasn't a road.

05:37.057 --> 05:38.192
For the millionth time,

05:38.259 --> 05:39.658
just because a road's
not on a map,

05:39.726 --> 05:40.659
doesn't mean it's not a road!

05:40.727 --> 05:41.794
Inside voice.

05:41.861 --> 05:42.895
You know what means
it's not a road?

05:42.963 --> 05:44.029
When there are guys in tanks

05:44.098 --> 05:45.398
telling you to turn around.

05:45.466 --> 05:46.799
Oh, come on! Those were
two kids in a jeep!

05:46.866 --> 05:47.900
Car gets stuck in the mud,

05:47.968 --> 05:49.868
and no, you could not move it,

05:49.936 --> 05:51.537
- Oh, here it is.
- Because, God forbid, you break a nail!

05:51.605 --> 05:53.772
I got one manicure,
one time!

05:53.840 --> 05:56.075
I'm not doing this.
I'm not doing this!

your "quethadillath"?

06:07.821 --> 06:08.854
That's it.

06:16.195 --> 06:17.596
JESS:
<i>It was crazy.</i>

06:17.663 --> 06:19.697
There was, like,
serious heat between them.

06:19.765 --> 06:20.932
Does she still have
feelings for him?

06:21.000 --> 06:22.734
JESS:
Maybe...

06:22.801 --> 06:23.901
Hey, Schmidt.

06:23.969 --> 06:25.604
(clears throat)
What up?

06:25.671 --> 06:26.838
So, Nadia's excited
for your date tonight.

06:26.905 --> 06:28.372
I bet.

06:28.440 --> 06:29.573
Make sure, uh,
you use protection.

06:29.641 --> 06:30.974
She's a foreigner, Cece.

06:31.042 --> 06:32.876
What, do I look
like an idiot?

06:32.944 --> 06:35.279
Seriously, she doesn't even know
where she's been, all right?

06:35.347 --> 06:37.181
What, are we at Santa's
family reunion?

06:37.249 --> 06:39.283
'Cause the "clawses"
are coming out.

06:41.019 --> 06:43.654
The-the "claws" are coming out?
You know...

06:43.721 --> 06:45.355
You're being
catty, Cece.

06:46.990 --> 06:48.525
(door opens, closes)

06:48.592 --> 06:51.227
Are you gonna let him
go out with Nadia?

06:51.295 --> 06:54.531
She was kicked out
of Russia, Cece. Russia.

06:54.598 --> 06:56.999
Come on, why don't you just
tell him you like him?

06:57.067 --> 06:58.701
It doesn't matter
if I like him.

06:58.769 --> 07:01.170
- It's over.
- And you're fine with that?

07:01.737 --> 07:03.305
- Yeah.
- Are you?

07:03.373 --> 07:04.939
Yeah.

07:05.007 --> 07:06.375
Are you?

07:06.442 --> 07:07.676
- Yeah.
- Hold up. Are you?

07:07.743 --> 07:09.211
- I am gonna kill you.
- But are you?

07:14.584 --> 07:16.450
- Hey, Nick...
- What?

07:16.518 --> 07:18.052
Have you seen
Shelby's cat Rummikub?

07:18.119 --> 07:19.253
I mean, he is the cutest.

07:19.321 --> 07:20.655
Just the absolute cutest.

07:20.722 --> 07:22.256
All right, take a look
at this picture

07:22.324 --> 07:23.924
where he woke up on my face.

07:23.992 --> 07:25.193
Can't even see my face.

07:25.260 --> 07:26.594
I look like a cat man.

07:26.662 --> 07:27.562
(laughing)

07:27.629 --> 07:28.962
(birds cawing)

07:29.030 --> 07:31.299
No! No!
Get out of here, birds!

07:31.366 --> 07:33.233
Please get out of here,
you sky rats!

07:33.301 --> 07:35.802
Go back to Hell,
where you belong!

07:35.869 --> 07:37.304
Leave me and my plants alone!

07:37.371 --> 07:38.605
I need this!

07:38.673 --> 07:40.006
You know who loves birds?

07:40.074 --> 07:41.374
Please don't say it,
Winston.

07:41.442 --> 07:43.243
Shelby.

07:46.814 --> 07:49.014
So...

07:51.585 --> 07:53.018
How do you like America?

07:53.086 --> 07:55.521
I like salad bar.

07:55.589 --> 07:57.989
I like <i>Despicable Me.</i>

07:58.057 --> 08:00.693
<i>Tosh 2.0.</i>

08:00.760 --> 08:03.295
I like Connect 4,

08:03.363 --> 08:05.697
freedom of speech,

08:05.764 --> 08:07.164
David Fincher,

08:07.233 --> 08:10.034
uh... sidewalk.

08:10.102 --> 08:13.971
I like 1-800-SLIM.

08:14.539 --> 08:16.774
"Your Mama" jokes.

08:17.342 --> 08:18.710
Strawberry.

08:19.277 --> 08:22.379
Wilmer Velmavelma.

08:22.447 --> 08:24.414
Leon J. Panetta.

08:24.482 --> 08:27.551
Ice skating for fun,
not to save life.

08:27.619 --> 08:28.585
(laughs quietly)

08:28.653 --> 08:30.053
What are you
laughing at?

08:30.121 --> 08:31.688
Cheese. Is for mouse.

08:31.756 --> 08:33.624
Are you Mick Mouse?

08:33.691 --> 08:35.457
- Am I what?
- Why don't you get in your spaceship

08:35.458 --> 08:37.226
like Mick Mouse?

08:37.294 --> 08:38.327
- What are you talking about?
- Mick Mouse.

08:38.395 --> 08:40.328
- What is a Mick Mouse?
- Mick Mouse!

08:40.397 --> 08:42.097
I don't understand
what Mick Mouse is!

08:42.164 --> 08:44.600
- Mick Mouse!
- I don't under... I don't...

08:44.668 --> 08:45.501
What does that mean?
What's a Mick Mouse?

08:45.569 --> 08:46.736
Mick Mouse!

08:46.803 --> 08:47.970
Are you saying Mickey Mouse?

08:48.037 --> 08:48.971
Yes.

08:49.038 --> 08:50.706
In America, honey, okay,

08:50.774 --> 08:53.007
Mickey Mouse, he's earthbound.

08:53.075 --> 08:54.676
Let's do sex party.

08:54.744 --> 08:57.044
I sex you in face.

08:57.112 --> 08:59.046
You're gonna sex me in my face?

09:01.317 --> 09:03.151
Well, fancy meeting
you here.

09:03.218 --> 09:05.153
- Hi.
- What's up?

09:05.220 --> 09:06.288
Love the gym.

09:07.456 --> 09:08.922
You and Russell, huh?

09:08.990 --> 09:10.291
- Oh... God.
- Last night?

09:10.358 --> 09:11.759
Sorry.

09:11.826 --> 09:13.226
If we made you feel
uncomfortable.

09:13.295 --> 09:14.961
We just can't be
in the same room

09:15.029 --> 09:17.364
without wanting to rip
each other's faces off.

09:17.432 --> 09:19.099
Yeah... yeah.

09:19.167 --> 09:20.434
Well, as long
as it's, like, you know, faces

09:20.502 --> 09:22.469
and not, like... clothes.

09:22.537 --> 09:24.504
- You don't think...
- No.

09:24.571 --> 09:27.273
I'm just... it's my endorphins,

09:27.341 --> 09:29.676
'cause I'm just, like, so high
on endorphins.

09:29.743 --> 09:31.344
Yeah, because there's not
a chance in hell.

09:31.412 --> 09:32.845
I mean, he is all yours.

09:32.913 --> 09:34.380
All yours.

09:34.948 --> 09:36.316
Awesome.

09:36.383 --> 09:38.284
I mean, you know
what it's like with Russell.

09:38.352 --> 09:39.619
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

09:39.687 --> 09:41.453
I mean...
It's this roller coaster.

09:41.521 --> 09:44.323
It's like standing
on the bow of a catamaran

09:44.390 --> 09:48.393
blasted with spray
during a perfect storm.

09:48.461 --> 09:50.161
(sighs passionately)
But you're...

09:50.229 --> 09:52.931
naked and... (gasping)

09:52.998 --> 09:54.533
and you're on fire.

09:54.600 --> 09:55.600
(giggling)

09:55.668 --> 09:56.701
You know?

09:56.768 --> 09:59.169
- Yeah. I do.
- Whoo!

09:59.237 --> 10:02.807
I'm just, like, "Russell,
put away the passion."

10:02.874 --> 10:04.908
(sighs)
And...

10:04.976 --> 10:06.577
show me a moderately good time.

10:06.645 --> 10:07.578
Yeah.

10:07.646 --> 10:08.846
Crazy.

10:08.913 --> 10:11.114
- So crazy.
- It's crazy.

10:11.182 --> 10:13.049
Russell.

10:20.559 --> 10:21.960
- Hey!
- What?

10:22.027 --> 10:23.194
What's with all
the hammering?

10:23.262 --> 10:24.662
Whoa!
What the hell is this thing?

10:24.663 --> 10:25.729
This thing is creepy.

10:25.797 --> 10:27.798
Yeah, it's called
a scarecrow, okay?

10:27.866 --> 10:29.800
Birds keep coming after
my plants.

10:29.868 --> 10:32.435
Whatever you're doing, just...
stop with the hammering, okay?

10:32.503 --> 10:33.971
Because me and Shelby are
downstairs, right now,

10:34.038 --> 10:35.873
trying to make love.

10:35.940 --> 10:37.141
- Ugh! Did you honestly just say that?
- Well, dude,

10:37.208 --> 10:38.809
we're making love, man.
It's beautiful.

10:38.877 --> 10:40.244
Who have you become, man?

10:40.311 --> 10:41.844
I'm happy.
Am I not allowed to be happy?

10:41.912 --> 10:43.379
You're allowed to be happy,

10:43.446 --> 10:45.113
but it's really annoying,
the way you're doing it.

10:45.182 --> 10:46.615
You know what I
don't care about?

10:46.683 --> 10:47.917
- Mm-hmm?
- Shelby.

10:48.485 --> 10:50.318
Oh, Shelby loves puzzles.

10:50.487 --> 10:53.222
Oh, Shelby loves donuts,
but hates donut holes.

10:53.290 --> 10:54.757
Why are you hating
on Shelby so much?

10:54.825 --> 10:56.992
I used to be your Shelby!

10:57.059 --> 10:58.794
That came out wrong.

10:58.861 --> 11:00.695
I'm sorry, I didn't know
it was my fault

11:00.763 --> 11:02.831
that your life sucks
and you're so miserable.

11:02.899 --> 11:05.133
Look at yourself!
You look like one of those guys

11:05.201 --> 11:07.701
who crawls out of the grave
in the "Thriller" video.

11:13.541 --> 11:15.309
- I want you to git.
- Seriously?

11:15.310 --> 11:17.845
- I want you to git off my farm!
- This is a little weird, man.

11:17.913 --> 11:20.347
- You used to be my best friend.
Now, I don't know! - Talk to yourself, man.

11:20.415 --> 11:22.382
- So git!
- I'm gitten!

11:22.450 --> 11:24.418
- I don't need ya!
- Shut up!

11:32.425 --> 11:33.591
Hey, Russell.

11:33.592 --> 11:34.593
Mm-hmm.

11:35.161 --> 11:36.829
Do I ever drive you crazy?

11:37.396 --> 11:38.997
Of course not.

11:39.065 --> 11:40.599
Come on. There has to be
something that I do

11:40.667 --> 11:43.135
that just, like...
gets under your skin.

11:43.203 --> 11:44.769
No, I can't think of anything.

11:44.838 --> 11:46.671
Come on, Russell. Think.

11:46.739 --> 11:48.006
Think, think, think, think.

11:48.774 --> 11:49.808
Thin-k.

11:49.876 --> 11:52.610
That's annoying, right,
the way I say, "Think"?

11:52.678 --> 11:53.778
- Well...
- With a "K."

11:53.846 --> 11:56.113
Okay, Jess, um...

11:56.581 --> 11:57.949
Your eyes bug out a little

11:57.950 --> 11:59.551
- when you're trying to make a point.
- Yeah?

11:59.552 --> 12:02.920
Yeah. And you do this,
uh, squatting thing

12:02.988 --> 12:04.522
- when you're thinking sometimes.
- Yeah?

12:04.590 --> 12:06.190
Yeah. Don't love that.

12:08.460 --> 12:11.094
- Like that? Like that?
- Uh...

12:11.162 --> 12:12.896
Yeah, and I've never
actually seen both of

12:12.964 --> 12:14.832
those things together, so
it's not a favorite of mine.

12:14.899 --> 12:17.601
Is this just
driving you crazy?

12:17.669 --> 12:18.836
(huffs)
Um...

12:18.903 --> 12:21.037
No, but it's not pleasant.

12:21.105 --> 12:22.205
You're not pleasant.

12:23.741 --> 12:25.274
You're not pleasant.

12:25.342 --> 12:26.776
- That's not nice, that's-that's...
- Yeah.

12:26.844 --> 12:28.110
- Not nice.
- No, it's passion!

12:28.178 --> 12:30.413
Oh! You hurt my teeth.

12:30.481 --> 12:32.348
Yeah, what you gonna
do about it, Russell?

12:32.416 --> 12:34.316
Uh, well, I mean,
probably nothing.

12:34.385 --> 12:36.719
You know, I hate this shirt,
I hate this shirt.

12:36.787 --> 12:38.988
Okay. Okay, you know, well
could you please... thank you.

12:41.056 --> 12:43.224
There it is.
There's the fire.

12:43.292 --> 12:45.560
Where you been hiding it, Rusty?
Where you been hiding it?

12:45.628 --> 12:46.961
I'm gonna, um, make some tea.

12:47.029 --> 12:48.397
Do you want some tea?
We have chamomile.

12:48.464 --> 12:49.865
- No!
- Okay. I mean...

12:49.932 --> 12:52.467
oolong... oolong,
you want oolong?

12:52.535 --> 12:55.636
Ugh, I hate that you have
so many coasters! Why?

12:55.704 --> 12:57.170
- Well, it's actually kind
of a funny story... - Yeah?

12:57.238 --> 12:59.039
- Wow. - You just coasting
through life,

12:59.107 --> 13:01.442
- you coaster? - This isn't good, not at all.
What are you...

13:01.510 --> 13:03.744
You know, now-now I'm pissed.
What is this?

13:03.812 --> 13:06.179
(sighs)

13:06.747 --> 13:08.181
Something's missing.

13:08.249 --> 13:09.617
I didn't know it

13:09.684 --> 13:12.084
until I saw you and Ouli
together the other night

13:12.152 --> 13:14.053
almost strangle each other.

13:14.121 --> 13:15.922
But then it clicked.

13:15.989 --> 13:17.657
I want that.

13:19.293 --> 13:21.128
I want what you and Ouli have.

13:21.129 --> 13:23.396
You want me to treat you
like my ex-wife?

13:23.964 --> 13:25.231
Who I hate?

13:25.799 --> 13:27.966
I don't know, I just...

13:28.034 --> 13:30.268
(sighs)
You guys have this spark,

13:30.336 --> 13:32.203
and I want that spark!

13:32.271 --> 13:33.872
You have to admit,

13:33.940 --> 13:35.206
you have this spark,
this passion.

13:36.643 --> 13:39.344
Passion's overrated, Jess.

13:43.515 --> 13:45.950
I knew we shouldn't have
gone to that dinner, I...

13:46.017 --> 13:47.418
I want to go home.

13:47.486 --> 13:48.753
Jess...

13:48.821 --> 13:50.955
Just...

13:51.022 --> 13:53.190
can you just take me home?

13:59.196 --> 14:00.229
Get in there!

14:00.297 --> 14:02.065
Useless.

14:02.132 --> 14:04.601
You... get...
in there.

14:04.669 --> 14:07.036
What is this, Martin Scorsese's
<i>The Wizard of Oz?</i>

14:07.104 --> 14:08.872
I'm sorry about what
happened on the roof, man.

14:08.940 --> 14:10.941
Apology accepted.

14:11.008 --> 14:12.375
It's just... we used to be
miserable together, man.

14:12.443 --> 14:14.377
(chuckling)

14:14.445 --> 14:17.713
- We did have some pretty bad times together.
- Had the worst.

14:17.781 --> 14:19.215
Hey, remember that time
we pooled our money

14:19.283 --> 14:20.649
and bought that online
dating profile together?

14:20.717 --> 14:22.151
Yes.
(laughs)

14:22.219 --> 14:24.320
The ladies did not care
for Ninston Biller.

14:24.388 --> 14:26.322
- Zero dates.
- Zero.

14:26.390 --> 14:29.192
I'm sorry that I can't
be happier for you.

14:29.259 --> 14:31.394
I don't really know what's
wrong with me, Winston.

14:31.462 --> 14:32.995
- You want me to tell you?
- Not really, actually.

14:33.062 --> 14:34.562
Okay, why are you giving up?

14:34.630 --> 14:36.831
If something doesn't work out,
what do you do?

14:36.899 --> 14:39.001
You make an adjustment,
you give it one more shot.

14:39.068 --> 14:41.536
- I mean, that's what I did with...
- Okay, just say it.

14:41.604 --> 14:42.871
- ...My beautiful Shelby.
- Shelby.

14:42.938 --> 14:44.006
See, why did you say,
"my beautiful Shelby"?

14:44.073 --> 14:45.407
It's so weird.

14:45.475 --> 14:47.476
Look, man, I just called her
out of the blue, okay?

14:47.543 --> 14:49.643
And then...
I was a different person,

14:49.711 --> 14:52.179
and she was a different person.
Now look at us, man.

14:52.247 --> 14:55.182
We're eating sandwiches and
making love to one another.

14:56.751 --> 14:58.452
Sandwiches and sex?

14:58.520 --> 15:00.621
I want that.

15:02.991 --> 15:04.424
Hey.

15:04.492 --> 15:07.460
How, um... how was
your date last night?

15:07.528 --> 15:10.363
Brief. Small man go to hospital.

15:10.931 --> 15:12.198
The hospital?

15:12.266 --> 15:14.067
- Is he okay?
- I don't know.

15:14.135 --> 15:16.569
I leave him there,
I go make bowling.

15:16.637 --> 15:19.305
Nadia... like, honestly,
what did you do to him?

15:19.373 --> 15:21.873
Well, he cry and cry.
It was so funny.

15:21.941 --> 15:23.375
Oh, my God.

15:23.443 --> 15:25.644
There's me!

15:30.469 --> 15:33.071
I really like what we have.
I thought you did, too.

15:33.138 --> 15:35.538
I do. I did.
It's just, Russell...

15:38.176 --> 15:39.976
Great. Just forget it.

15:40.044 --> 15:42.679
Yeah, that seems to happen
every time you're in this car.

15:42.747 --> 15:45.448
But there's so many buttons.
It's like...

15:45.516 --> 15:48.719
The Batmobile doesn't
have so many buttons.

15:49.486 --> 15:52.387
Look, Jess,
I've already done the crazy,

15:52.455 --> 15:54.256
explosive passion thing.

15:54.324 --> 15:56.658
When I was with Ouli, it was
like edging closer and closer

15:56.727 --> 15:57.960
to a wood chipper.

15:59.429 --> 16:01.263
I'm not looking
for that any more.

16:02.331 --> 16:03.565
I understand.

16:04.133 --> 16:05.935
But I am.

16:06.702 --> 16:07.902
And...

16:07.970 --> 16:11.340
I want passion...

16:11.407 --> 16:14.008
even if it's harder
and hurts more.

16:16.746 --> 16:19.348
So that's it.

16:19.415 --> 16:20.982
Good-bye, Russell.

16:23.485 --> 16:25.386
(grunts)

16:27.389 --> 16:28.789
Well...

16:28.857 --> 16:30.691
Yeah.

16:34.429 --> 16:36.530
Oh, my God.

16:36.598 --> 16:38.431
Are you serious?

16:38.499 --> 16:41.200
How do you look this good
under fluorescent lights?

16:41.269 --> 16:43.603
I am so, so sorry.

16:43.671 --> 16:47.140
Okay? This is all my fault.
I thought...

16:47.207 --> 16:48.475
What happened?

16:48.542 --> 16:50.076
(clears throat)

16:50.144 --> 16:53.446
Yeah, um... this
is embarrassing.

16:55.081 --> 16:56.448
I broke my penis.

16:56.516 --> 16:57.849
You what?

16:57.917 --> 16:59.418
I broke my penis.

16:59.486 --> 17:01.287
Things got... I mean,
just out of control

17:01.354 --> 17:02.521
with Nadia last night.

17:02.589 --> 17:04.323
And there was like

17:04.391 --> 17:07.092
this one moment where
it was just blinding pain.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.727
And then there was another
moment where I was like

17:08.795 --> 17:10.928
watching myself
watch myself...

17:10.996 --> 17:13.765
I think I finally understand
what <i>The Tree of Life</i> is about.

17:13.832 --> 17:16.032
And I can't be
certain of this,

17:16.101 --> 17:18.102
but I'm almost positive

17:18.170 --> 17:20.471
that Nadia's vagina
contains a right angle.

17:20.539 --> 17:22.807
- I'm leaving. I cannot believe I came here.
- How are you upset right now?

17:23.574 --> 17:25.343
Cece, you ended this.

17:25.411 --> 17:27.242
I don't know what
you want from me!

17:27.311 --> 17:29.746
I don't want you
sleeping with Nadia.

17:29.814 --> 17:33.216
Are you crazy? I don't want you
sleeping with anyone.

17:35.119 --> 17:36.920
Because I like you.

17:39.757 --> 17:42.225
I can't just always say
what I feel, okay?

17:42.293 --> 17:43.992
It's just...

17:44.060 --> 17:46.028
Just, whatever, Schmidt.

17:46.095 --> 17:48.864
You like me.

17:48.932 --> 17:50.533
You like my personality?

17:50.600 --> 17:52.067
I was surprised, too.

17:53.135 --> 17:54.136
Come here.

18:00.175 --> 18:01.242
- Oh!
- Oh!

18:01.310 --> 18:02.944
(yells)

18:03.011 --> 18:06.147
- What happened?
- Oh, my God, why?

18:06.215 --> 18:07.782
(moans)
Oh, what?

18:07.850 --> 18:09.584
Oh, my God, my penis is
having a heart attack.

18:09.652 --> 18:10.918
- Don't touch me, don't touch me.
- Okay. I...

18:10.986 --> 18:12.854
- You gotta get out of here.
- All right.

18:12.921 --> 18:14.055
I mean, I'd-I'd like...
don't bend over!

18:14.122 --> 18:15.723
For crying out loud!
What are you, nuts?

18:15.790 --> 18:17.224
I'm sorry, it's the yoga pants.

18:17.291 --> 18:19.025
I'm sorry for this, but I...

18:19.093 --> 18:20.527
- I like you.
- And I like you, too, so much.

18:20.595 --> 18:22.229
Call a nurse,
call a male nurse.

18:22.296 --> 18:24.030
Probably a heavy-set
male nurse would be nice.

18:24.098 --> 18:25.566
Bye.

18:25.633 --> 18:27.267
Describe it to them as like a...
as a battered highway cone.

18:27.335 --> 18:28.435

18:31.004 --> 18:33.406

18:45.586 --> 18:47.519
Hey...

18:47.587 --> 18:48.953
Caroline, how you doing?

18:49.021 --> 18:50.689
Good.

18:50.757 --> 18:53.091
Just... going to
use the bathroom.

18:53.158 --> 18:55.894
♪ For sentimental reasons... ♪

18:55.961 --> 18:57.429
- Caroline?
- Yeah, I know.

18:57.497 --> 19:00.031
I just called her, and then...
I don't know, it's...

19:00.099 --> 19:02.533
What are you doing? You guys had
such a terrible relationship.

19:02.601 --> 19:03.768
Are you crazy?

19:03.835 --> 19:05.370
Are you burning incense?

19:05.437 --> 19:07.638
Yes, I am, for ambiance.
She digs it.

19:07.706 --> 19:09.606
She <i>digs</i> it?

19:09.673 --> 19:11.708
Are you kidding, Nick?
What happened?

19:11.776 --> 19:13.110
What happened to
swearing off women

19:13.177 --> 19:15.312
and focusing on tomatoes?

19:15.380 --> 19:17.747
I can't grow tomatoes, Jess.

19:18.315 --> 19:21.285
I think this is what was
supposed to happen all along.

19:21.352 --> 19:24.087
Me and Caroline.
And I'm okay with it.

19:24.155 --> 19:25.621
I'm happy.

19:25.688 --> 19:27.623
That is pathetic, Nick.
You're just saying that

19:27.690 --> 19:28.824
'cause you don't
have the patience

19:28.892 --> 19:30.393
or the courage to be alone.

19:30.460 --> 19:31.961
I will never get
used to those urinals.

19:32.029 --> 19:33.396
(laughs)

19:33.464 --> 19:35.665
Hey, would you give me a second?
I have to talk to Jess for...

19:35.733 --> 19:37.033
Oh. Sure.

19:37.100 --> 19:38.200
- Great.
- Okay.

19:38.268 --> 19:40.269
- Bye, Caroline.
- Bye.

19:40.337 --> 19:42.570
See you in one second.
What is your problem?

19:42.638 --> 19:45.307
Have fun making
terrible life decisions!

19:45.374 --> 19:46.841
Oh, you just know
everything, don't you?

19:46.909 --> 19:48.576
- No, I don't...
- I'm actually so sick of you.

19:48.644 --> 19:50.445
I'm just really
disappointed in you.

19:50.512 --> 19:52.414
You know, maybe I'll be
more like you, Jess,

19:52.481 --> 19:54.682
and I'll go run into the
kitchen and make pastries

19:54.750 --> 19:55.917
- with sprinklies on them,
- That isn't what I do.

19:55.985 --> 19:58.118
Then throw some
dumb pajama outfit on,

19:58.186 --> 20:00.321
and then tell other people
how to live their lives!

20:00.388 --> 20:02.222
It's not a pajama outfit!

20:02.290 --> 20:04.558
- They're called pajamas!
- That's what I said!

20:04.625 --> 20:06.493
Nick, why don't you
go back in your room

20:06.561 --> 20:07.995
and put on
your stupid flannel

20:08.063 --> 20:10.331
and keep not living up
to your potential!

20:10.398 --> 20:12.333
- You're a crazy person, Jess!
- I am not,

20:12.400 --> 20:13.967
I'm just saying things
that you don't want to hear.

20:14.034 --> 20:15.301
You know what I would
like to hear from you?

20:15.369 --> 20:16.735
- What?
- Silence!

20:16.803 --> 20:18.938
Well, I'm not gonna
be silenced!

20:19.006 --> 20:20.606
Just shut up!
For one second be quiet!

20:20.674 --> 20:22.442
- I'm trying to help you!
- Please be quiet!

20:22.509 --> 20:23.676
- No! No!
- I don't want your help.

20:23.743 --> 20:25.578
Stop making that face at me.
I hate that face.

20:25.645 --> 20:28.047
This is my only face!
I don't have a lot of faces,

20:28.115 --> 20:30.782
and if you don't like
looking at my face, Jess...

20:32.352 --> 20:35.053
...then look at my ass!

20:36.389 --> 20:39.157
- Oh!
- Yeah! Get a good look!

20:39.225 --> 20:41.893
- Stop shaking your ass at me, you quitter.
- This is the ass of a failure.

20:41.961 --> 20:44.396
- You get a look.
- Look right at my ass.

20:44.464 --> 20:46.964
- No, Nick.
- You bought the ticket, take a ride.

20:47.032 --> 20:49.967
- Feast your eyes on my butt.
- I'm winning this moment.

20:50.035 --> 20:51.802
- You quitter. - Look at my butt,
it's going faster than yours!

20:51.870 --> 20:54.305
I have the fastest
butt in the land.

20:54.373 --> 20:56.140
- I got a faster one!
- No, you don't.

20:56.208 --> 20:58.142
- What are we doing?
- Stop looking at my ass.

20:58.710 --> 21:00.077
Oh, I'm gonna kill you.

21:01.412 --> 21:03.080
Quitter!

21:06.149 --> 21:08.251
You really think Nick is
gonna believe that a tomato

21:08.319 --> 21:10.353
just sprung up overnight?

21:10.421 --> 21:11.587
Yes, I do.

21:11.655 --> 21:13.323
When it comes to tomatoes,

21:13.391 --> 21:16.226
no one in the world
knows less than Nick.

21:16.293 --> 21:18.660
- So how long you gotta ice that thing?
- Eight weeks.

21:18.728 --> 21:20.396
I mean, if I have
any excitement

21:20.463 --> 21:22.331
it's excruciating pain.

21:22.399 --> 21:23.765
- Boobies.
- What?

21:24.233 --> 21:27.769
- Boobies.
- I love boobies...

21:27.837 --> 21:30.705
- Girls with clean hair. - Winston, this is
the least funny game we've ever played.

21:30.773 --> 21:32.541
Models eating sliders.

21:32.998 --> 21:34.275
(moaning)
Bernadette Peters on a high beam.

21:34.343 --> 21:35.377
(wailing)

21:35.443 --> 21:37.577
- Freshly baked bread.
- Oh God.
