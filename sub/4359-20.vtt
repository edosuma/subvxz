01:54.520 --> 01:56.920
Ray, what are
you doing?

01:58.320 --> 02:02.120
Training for
the Rooney Runabout.

02:02.120 --> 02:04.120
The what?

02:04.120 --> 02:05.480
The Rooney Runabout.

02:05.480 --> 02:07.320
Every kid's worst nightmare.

02:07.320 --> 02:08.840
You have to run a mile

02:08.840 --> 02:11.640
with, like, 50 pounds
strapped to your back

02:11.640 --> 02:14.000
pole vault over a fence,
everything.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.480
Alex: Is the Rooney
Runabout that thing

02:16.480 --> 02:19.280
where Mitch Gumpstein
tripped over a hurdle

02:19.280 --> 02:20.960
and lost his front tooth?

02:20.960 --> 02:23.880
Yeah, and Rooney
gave him an "F."

02:23.880 --> 02:26.720
Um, when do you
have to do this?

02:26.720 --> 02:28.200
Ray:
In two weeks

02:28.200 --> 02:31.280
but you have to take yours
in one.

02:31.280 --> 02:32.600
I do?

02:32.600 --> 02:35.280
I'm glad I don't have Rooney
until next semester.

02:35.280 --> 02:38.080
I hear every year a kid
gets taken to the hospital.

02:38.080 --> 02:39.320
The hospital?

02:39.320 --> 02:42.000
Ray: Yeah, but it's
not going to be me.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.440
This year I'm going to break
the Runabout record.

02:45.440 --> 02:47.760
In fact,
I'm going to shatter it.

02:47.760 --> 02:49.080
Alex:
Don't worry.

02:49.080 --> 02:50.840
It's not such a big deal.

02:50.840 --> 02:53.680
I mean, if Annie can pass it,
so can you.

02:56.520 --> 02:58.000
<i>( Blowing whistle )</i>

02:58.000 --> 03:03.280
All right, cupcakes,
you've had it easy all semester.

03:03.280 --> 03:04.920
That ends today.

03:04.920 --> 03:08.640
Like it or not,
you will all come face to face

03:08.640 --> 03:10.720
with your inner champion.

03:10.720 --> 03:16.040
I'm sure you've all heard
stories from your little friends

03:16.040 --> 03:18.040
about how hard it is.

03:18.040 --> 03:22.160
Well, that's 'cause
it's supposed to be hard.

03:22.160 --> 03:25.280
True tests of character
are always hard.

03:25.280 --> 03:29.520
The Runabout starts
with one lap around the track.

03:29.520 --> 03:33.160
Then you will run
the obstacle course

03:33.160 --> 03:35.160
you'll throw the javelin

03:35.160 --> 03:39.080
and head inside to the gym
for the rope climb.

03:39.080 --> 03:40.600
Any questions?

03:40.600 --> 03:46.120
Anybody who fails to master
even one of these skills

03:46.120 --> 03:49.800
will join me this spring
in remedial P.E.

03:49.800 --> 03:51.800
Let's line up for practice.

03:51.800 --> 03:53.120
<i>( Blows whistle )</i>

03:53.120 --> 03:54.640
Let's go!

03:54.640 --> 03:56.720
Let's go, let's go!

04:00.120 --> 04:02.400
<i>( Whistles each to start )</i>

04:31.640 --> 04:34.560
Robyn, why aren't you
out there?

04:34.560 --> 04:36.760
This body was not made

04:36.760 --> 04:38.560
for running around
in the hot sun.

04:38.560 --> 04:39.960
My skin burns easily

04:39.960 --> 04:42.360
and if I perspire,
my sun block won't work.

04:42.360 --> 04:44.160
You have to do the Runabout
to pass.

04:44.160 --> 04:45.760
You'll have to take P.E. Again.

04:45.760 --> 04:48.760
Alex, there are two kinds
of people in this world:

04:48.760 --> 04:50.360
Those who accept their fate

04:50.360 --> 04:53.200
and those who foolishly
try to change it.

04:53.200 --> 04:55.960
I bet you'll be
as good as anyone else.

04:55.960 --> 04:57.480
You just have to try.

04:57.480 --> 04:59.160
Didn't Mr. Rooney say

04:59.160 --> 05:02.800
you were supposed to release
your inner champion?

05:02.800 --> 05:03.960
I have no choice.

05:03.960 --> 05:06.400
I'll have to reason
with Mr. Rooney.

05:06.400 --> 05:08.840
I'll explain
my physical limitations

05:08.840 --> 05:11.440
and we can come to
some understanding.

05:11.440 --> 05:14.440
With Mr. Rooney?
And you say I'm an optimist.

05:14.440 --> 05:16.920
What do you want, Alex?

05:16.920 --> 05:19.280
I'm desperate.

05:19.280 --> 05:23.040
Rooney: 12 years, nobody
has ever been excused

05:23.040 --> 05:25.200
from the Rooney Runabout.

05:25.200 --> 05:28.800
Oh, students have tried,
but I am too smart for 'em.

05:28.800 --> 05:32.440
You think I can't tell
a phony note from your doctor

05:32.440 --> 05:33.880
when I see one? Huh!

05:33.880 --> 05:36.240
You'll thank me for this, Smith.

05:36.240 --> 05:39.160
Next week you'll be walking
around school

05:39.160 --> 05:40.720
with your head held high

05:40.720 --> 05:44.200
knowing you had the grit and
determination to make it.

05:44.200 --> 05:47.560
The Runabout will make
a man out of you.

05:47.560 --> 05:48.920
Now, get going.

05:50.120 --> 05:53.400
What is it, Russo?

05:57.720 --> 05:59.040
Well?

05:59.040 --> 06:00.560
Um, ah...

06:00.560 --> 06:02.040
I had a question about, uh...

06:03.640 --> 06:04.800
...athlete's foot?

06:04.800 --> 06:06.920
Russo, athlete's foot has

06:06.920 --> 06:08.840
nothing to do with athletics.

06:08.840 --> 06:11.880
It is a contagional
fungus infection

06:11.880 --> 06:13.960
characterized by itching

06:13.960 --> 06:15.840
cracking and scaling.

06:15.840 --> 06:17.280
Between the toes

06:17.280 --> 06:19.160
after every workout.

06:19.160 --> 06:21.640
Oh, I see.

06:21.640 --> 06:24.440
Um, thank you,
thank you very much.

06:24.440 --> 06:26.000
Bye.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.280
Hey, Coach.

06:32.280 --> 06:34.440
What can
I do for you, Alvarado?

06:34.440 --> 06:37.080
You know I take
the Runabout next week.

06:37.080 --> 06:39.480
What's the record
for the fastest time?

06:39.480 --> 06:41.640
So I'll know how bad
I crushed it.

06:41.640 --> 06:44.000
That record is held
by Laphonso Ellis

06:44.000 --> 06:46.760
who currently plays
for the Denver Nuggets.

06:46.760 --> 06:49.880
We will never see the likes
of an athlete like that

06:49.880 --> 06:50.920
around here again

06:50.920 --> 06:52.160
so if I were you

06:52.160 --> 06:55.040
I wouldn't worry
about breaking any records.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.880
Well, you never know,
Coach.

06:56.880 --> 06:58.360
Sometimes you do, Ray.

06:58.360 --> 07:01.560
You ought to worry
about finishing the Runabout.

07:01.560 --> 07:04.040
Trying to live up
to Laphonso's legacy

07:04.040 --> 07:05.720
is a losing proposition.

07:05.720 --> 07:08.040
We'll just see about that.

07:09.640 --> 07:10.720
<i>( Chuckles )</i>

07:10.720 --> 07:13.200
<i>( Both giggling )</i>

07:13.200 --> 07:15.080
Alex, wait up.

07:16.080 --> 07:17.840
I'll see you.

07:17.840 --> 07:20.680
Alex, I cannot get out
of doing the Runabout.

07:20.680 --> 07:21.840
I need your help.

07:21.840 --> 07:24.360
No problem, we'll train
for it together.

07:24.360 --> 07:26.040
It'll give me
a head start.

07:26.040 --> 07:28.000
Train? You mean,
like practice?

07:28.000 --> 07:29.280
Well, I was thinking

07:29.280 --> 07:32.040
maybe you can show me
what to do on Friday?

07:32.040 --> 07:34.760
No, we've got to get you
in shape, Robyn.

07:34.760 --> 07:37.680
We've got to get out
the inner champion.

07:37.680 --> 07:39.800
Well, I have news
for Mr. Rooney.

07:39.800 --> 07:42.640
I have an inner ear,
I have an inner child...

07:42.640 --> 07:44.640
But I have no inner champion.

07:44.640 --> 07:47.240
We have to show him
what you're made of.

07:47.240 --> 07:49.240
Alex, I know
what I'm made of--

07:49.240 --> 07:51.800
bones that break,
joints that sprain...

07:51.800 --> 07:53.720
Let's get started.

07:53.720 --> 07:56.520
Let's start with
a brisk walk to the mall

07:56.520 --> 07:57.960
for a frozen yogurt.

07:57.960 --> 07:59.440
It'll be fun, trust me.

07:59.440 --> 08:00.600
No... Alex!

08:26.840 --> 08:28.440
Running out of time, coach.

08:28.440 --> 08:31.680
Tomorrow's your last chance
to get Robo-Robyn ready.

08:31.680 --> 08:33.760
I know, I know.

08:33.760 --> 08:35.240
But she's getting there.

08:35.240 --> 08:36.679
Robyn's a good athlete.

08:36.679 --> 08:38.440
She just doesn't
know it yet.

08:38.440 --> 08:40.240
It's not clear to me, either.

08:40.240 --> 08:42.000
Alex:
Maybe she just needs

08:42.000 --> 08:45.280
a little confidence boost
to get her started.

09:25.240 --> 09:26.240
<i>( Zapping )</i>

09:37.440 --> 09:39.560
Alex:
Okay, Robyn...

09:39.560 --> 09:42.040
This is the last part
of the Rooney Runabout.

09:42.040 --> 09:43.200
And the hardest.

09:43.200 --> 09:45.760
But we love challenges,
don't we, Robyn?

09:45.760 --> 09:46.480
Right.

09:47.880 --> 09:52.640
Um, okay,
well, here goes nothing.

09:57.040 --> 09:59.280
You can't rescue her
during the test.

09:59.280 --> 10:01.080
She'll have to
do it herself.

10:01.080 --> 10:03.680
I won't have to.
I'm not helping her now.

10:03.680 --> 10:04.920
Alex:
All right!

10:04.920 --> 10:06.960
You're doing great,
almost there.

10:06.960 --> 10:08.360
Way to go, Robyn!

10:08.360 --> 10:09.920
Look at her!

That was fresh.

I'm so tired.

10:27.080 --> 10:29.240
But you made it.
Feels good, doesn't it?

10:29.240 --> 10:31.360
Yeah. Yeah, I guess it does.

10:31.360 --> 10:33.000
By this time tomorrow

10:33.000 --> 10:36.280
Rooney will be
out of your life forever.

10:36.280 --> 10:37.920
You really think so?

10:37.920 --> 10:39.080
Definitely.

10:39.080 --> 10:40.600
Yeah.

10:40.600 --> 10:42.280

If you dig down deep,
you'll all come out winners.

I will be
closely monitoring the test

so don't even bother
trying to cheat.

11:03.600 --> 11:06.840
Once you throw the javelin

11:06.840 --> 11:10.960
you will come inside
for the rope.

Come on, Robyn, you can do it.

13:49.440 --> 13:52.040
It might have been
less painful for her.

13:52.040 --> 13:53.480
Rooney's cold.

13:55.160 --> 13:57.600
What makes you say that?

13:57.600 --> 14:00.320
No other kid matters
to him except Laphonso.

14:00.320 --> 14:02.200
He'll do everything
to keep me

14:02.200 --> 14:03.840
from breaking
that record.

14:03.840 --> 14:05.520
Why would he do that?

14:05.520 --> 14:08.160
Like, I said,
the man's heartless.

14:08.160 --> 14:09.440
I have to get him

14:09.440 --> 14:12.520
to give Robyn another
chance at the Runabout.

14:12.520 --> 14:14.280
Even if he did,
and he won't

14:14.280 --> 14:15.840
she'd never
try it again.

14:15.840 --> 14:18.840
You have ruined Robyn's
athletic career forever.

14:18.840 --> 14:19.920
<i>( Whirring )</i>

14:19.920 --> 14:21.680
Thanks a lot.

14:24.240 --> 14:25.920
Rooney:
Alexandra Mack.

14:25.920 --> 14:28.240
This must be about Russo.

14:29.920 --> 14:31.320
Well, um,
I was hoping

14:31.320 --> 14:32.920
that you could,
you know

14:32.920 --> 14:34.920
maybe give her
another chance?

14:34.920 --> 14:36.720
Because she
doesn't deserve

14:36.720 --> 14:38.280
to be in remedial P.E.

14:38.280 --> 14:40.760
Well, the test says she does.

14:40.760 --> 14:42.240
The test is wrong.

14:42.240 --> 14:44.880
We practiced
for the Runabout together.

14:44.880 --> 14:48.000
She climbed that rope
on Thursday, I saw her.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.520
You made her nervous.

14:49.520 --> 14:51.720
<i>Oh, I did, did I?
( Cackles )</i>

14:51.720 --> 14:54.280
The Rooney
Runabout

14:54.280 --> 14:57.960
isn't just a test for gym class,
it's a test for life.

14:57.960 --> 14:59.960
And part of passing the test

14:59.960 --> 15:02.680
includes meeting
the challenge

15:02.680 --> 15:05.400
regardless of
who is in attendance.

15:05.400 --> 15:06.880
Please,
Mr. Rooney

15:06.880 --> 15:08.760
Don't make her take P.E. Again.

15:08.760 --> 15:10.760
Please give her one more chance.

15:10.760 --> 15:12.800
I don't give

15:12.800 --> 15:14.280
second chances, Mack.

15:14.280 --> 15:16.040
But if all
she cares about

15:16.040 --> 15:18.160
is staying out
of remedial P.E.

15:18.160 --> 15:19.680
There is another way.

15:19.680 --> 15:20.720
There is?

15:20.720 --> 15:22.000
She can help me out

15:22.000 --> 15:23.600
as my equipment
manager.

15:23.600 --> 15:25.520
It's a lot of responsibility

15:25.520 --> 15:28.360
which will help her
in building character.

15:28.360 --> 15:30.280
Well, I'll tell
her about it.

15:30.280 --> 15:32.360
I'm sure she'd
rather do P.E. Again.

15:32.360 --> 15:34.040
If she agrees
to work for me

15:34.040 --> 15:36.240
I don't want to hear
any complaints

15:36.240 --> 15:38.560
or it will be springtime
with Rooney!

15:38.560 --> 15:41.440
Now, get out of here.

15:43.440 --> 15:45.560
<i>( Cackling )</i>

15:49.640 --> 15:50.920

15:50.920 --> 15:52.400

15:52.400 --> 15:53.840
Oh, hey, Coach!

15:53.840 --> 15:55.200
What are you doing?

15:55.200 --> 15:57.280
It's 5:00,
you should be home.

15:57.280 --> 16:00.320
I'm psyching myself up
for the Rooney Runabout.

16:00.320 --> 16:02.360
I know, it's Laphonso
Ellis's field

16:02.360 --> 16:04.240
but do you think
they might name

16:04.240 --> 16:05.480
the cafeteria after me

16:05.480 --> 16:06.800
if I break his record?

16:06.800 --> 16:09.040
Alvarado, you need
an attitude check.

16:09.040 --> 16:11.080
What do you mean?

16:11.080 --> 16:12.880
You're bragging
about something

16:12.880 --> 16:14.200
you haven't done yet.

16:14.200 --> 16:16.600
It's still a week
before the Runabout

16:16.600 --> 16:18.520
and we're naming
buildings after you.

16:18.520 --> 16:21.400
I'll make you forget
about Laphonso Ellis.

16:21.400 --> 16:23.720
I don't think so.

16:23.720 --> 16:26.000
You just don't want
a guy to win.

16:28.040 --> 16:29.800
I didn't say that.

16:35.520 --> 16:36.640
Hey, Robyn!

16:38.080 --> 16:40.120
Hey, how's it going?

16:40.120 --> 16:42.040
Are you sure this is okay?

16:42.040 --> 16:43.840
Who minds
doing a few chores

16:43.840 --> 16:46.320
if my inner champion
can take it easy.

16:46.320 --> 16:49.480
Besides, it's only
for the rest of the semester.

16:49.480 --> 16:51.320
Man:
Got that sport quench, Russo?

16:51.320 --> 16:54.000
Mack, don't bother
my assistant.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Well, back to work.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.520
Thanks again, Alex.

16:59.400 --> 17:01.960
Did you mix it
like I told you?

17:01.960 --> 17:03.600
Yes, Mr. Rooney.

17:05.599 --> 17:07.560
Hmm, it's too sweet,
Russo.

17:10.839 --> 17:12.359
Ray:
Hey, Alex...

17:12.359 --> 17:13.880
Next time I need
your help?

17:13.880 --> 17:14.880
Don't help.

17:14.880 --> 17:16.480
Ray, this isn't funny.

17:16.480 --> 17:18.200
Robyn's being tortured.

17:18.200 --> 17:20.200
I can't let her
go on like this.

17:20.200 --> 17:22.440
I got to get her
back on that rope.

17:22.440 --> 17:24.960
You're in over your head
as it is.

17:24.960 --> 17:28.040
I know,
but I can't quit now.

17:41.120 --> 17:43.560
Ray: Alex, what
are you doing?

17:43.560 --> 17:45.440
Don't worry
about it, Ray.

17:45.440 --> 17:47.720
I told you I'd get her
back on that rope.

17:52.880 --> 17:57.600
Rooney: You got five minutes
to finish that floor, Russo.

18:23.360 --> 18:25.040
Rooney:
Russo!

18:25.040 --> 18:26.560
Practice starts

18:26.560 --> 18:27.480
in ten minutes.

18:27.480 --> 18:28.560
I want you to get

18:28.560 --> 18:29.920
these mats laid out

18:29.920 --> 18:31.520
before the team gets here.

18:31.520 --> 18:33.360
Unfold them yourself.

18:34.880 --> 18:35.920
What was that?

18:37.200 --> 18:38.720
Robyn:
Yes, Mr. Rooney.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.080
What?

18:59.840 --> 19:01.120
Alex!

19:01.120 --> 19:02.120
Shh.

19:02.120 --> 19:03.320
Rooney:
Russo

19:03.320 --> 19:05.280
what's going on in here?

19:05.280 --> 19:07.720
Mr. Rooney,
they won't unfold...

19:07.720 --> 19:10.080
There's always an excuse, Russo.

19:10.080 --> 19:12.280
I don't understand,
a minute ago...

19:12.280 --> 19:13.400
How do you expect

19:13.400 --> 19:15.160
to succeed in life

19:15.160 --> 19:17.680
when you always take
the easy way out?

19:17.680 --> 19:20.080
Now you can't lay out the mats

19:20.080 --> 19:22.560
you can't even climb the rope.

19:24.280 --> 19:25.400
<i>( Zapping )</i>

19:32.200 --> 19:33.120
Hey!

19:33.120 --> 19:34.200
Mr. Rooney.

19:38.760 --> 19:40.440
Rooney:
Forget it

19:40.440 --> 19:41.520
you can't do it.

19:41.520 --> 19:42.720
Don't even bother.

19:42.720 --> 19:43.720
Both:
Come on.

19:43.720 --> 19:44.560
You can do it.

19:44.560 --> 19:45.720
Rooney:
Forget it.

19:45.720 --> 19:48.880
Come springtime, you're mine.

19:48.880 --> 19:51.640
Alex: Don't look down,
a little bit more.

19:51.640 --> 19:53.440
Ray:
Yeah, come on, Robyn.

19:53.440 --> 19:54.480
Forget it, Russo

19:54.480 --> 19:55.640
Don't even bother

19:55.640 --> 19:56.800
just give up.

19:56.800 --> 19:59.280
That's what you really want
isn't it?

19:59.280 --> 20:01.120
That's what you always do.

20:01.120 --> 20:02.600
Alex:
Come on, Robyn.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.600
Just give her a little push.

20:04.600 --> 20:06.400
No, she'll do it herself.

20:06.400 --> 20:07.760
Tired? Just let go!

20:07.760 --> 20:09.480
Alex:
He's worried, Robyn.

20:09.480 --> 20:13.400
Russo, there's a snail climbing
the rope faster than you.

20:13.400 --> 20:14.480
Almost there!

20:14.480 --> 20:15.920
Don't look down.

20:15.920 --> 20:18.040
Ray: Don't look
down. Come on, don't.

20:18.040 --> 20:19.240
Rooney:
Give up--

20:19.240 --> 20:21.480
you always do.

Way to go!

20:34.960 --> 20:36.720
I did it, you guys.

20:36.720 --> 20:38.920
I didn't do that for you,
Mr. Rooney.

20:38.920 --> 20:39.920
I did that for me.

20:39.920 --> 20:41.360
Come on, guys.

<i>( Robyn chuckling )</i>

20:43.360 --> 20:44.200
Hey, Russo.

20:44.200 --> 20:46.280
<i>( Snaps fingers )</i>

20:46.280 --> 20:48.960
You really showed me
something up there.

20:48.960 --> 20:50.400
You showed character.

20:50.400 --> 20:52.840
You found that
something extra inside

20:52.840 --> 20:55.360
that separates the men
from the boys.

20:55.360 --> 20:58.640
Now, don't forget what
happened here today, okay?

20:58.640 --> 20:59.600
I won't, sir.

20:59.600 --> 21:00.600
Now get out.

21:00.600 --> 21:02.520
I never want
to see you again.

21:02.520 --> 21:03.560
You mean...

21:03.560 --> 21:05.400
Don't make me
explain it again.

21:06.640 --> 21:08.680
Ray:
All right, Robyn!

21:08.680 --> 21:09.680
Alex:
Great!

21:09.680 --> 21:10.760
Robyn:
Whoo!

21:17.760 --> 21:19.640
Nice follow-through,
Alvarado.

21:19.640 --> 21:20.640
Hey, Coach.

21:20.640 --> 21:22.640
Take a break
for a second, Ray.

21:22.640 --> 21:23.840
I'm up to 58 feet.

21:23.840 --> 21:25.720
Yeah, I notice you out here.

21:25.720 --> 21:28.280
Lots of free time
for an eighth-grader.

21:28.280 --> 21:29.760
I checked with records

21:29.760 --> 21:32.760
and saw where you're getting
a "C" in English.

21:32.760 --> 21:34.400
It's not official yet.

21:34.400 --> 21:36.960
Well, Ray, I believe
we have to work hard

21:36.960 --> 21:39.200
on the skills
we need most in life.

21:39.200 --> 21:41.960
You know how many jobs
require the javelin?

21:41.960 --> 21:42.960
Not many.

21:42.960 --> 21:43.800
None.

21:43.800 --> 21:45.240
The Rooney Runabout is

21:45.240 --> 21:46.280
a character test

21:46.280 --> 21:48.400
and you're going at it
all wrong.

21:48.400 --> 21:51.520
Well, what's wrong to want
to break the record?

21:51.520 --> 21:52.760
Nothing, Ray.

21:52.760 --> 21:55.840
Look, how far can you
broad-jump right now?

21:55.840 --> 21:57.160
About 13 feet.

21:57.160 --> 21:59.000
Laphonso could do 21 feet

21:59.000 --> 22:01.880
on a bad day with
the wind against him.

22:01.880 --> 22:04.160
See, that's what
I'm trying to say.

22:04.160 --> 22:05.360
I know you think

22:05.360 --> 22:07.600
I don't want you
to break the record

22:07.600 --> 22:09.440
but the fact is,
Laphonso was

22:09.440 --> 22:10.760
totally dedicated.

22:10.760 --> 22:13.360
He worked hard,
every day for years.

22:13.360 --> 22:16.200
Now, how long have you
been training?

22:16.200 --> 22:17.520
About eight days.

22:17.520 --> 22:18.800
And that is fine.

22:18.800 --> 22:21.320
'Cause all I want you
to do is the best

22:21.320 --> 22:23.320
that Raymond
Alvarado can do.

22:23.320 --> 22:25.120
And I want
to give you this.

22:25.120 --> 22:27.600
That was Laphonso's.
He sweated on it.

22:27.600 --> 22:30.800
Maybe that will remind you
what a privilege it is

22:30.800 --> 22:33.240
just to go to the same
school he did.

22:33.240 --> 22:34.720
Thanks, Coach.

22:34.720 --> 22:35.800
All right.

22:35.800 --> 22:37.920
You know
what I want you to do.

22:37.920 --> 22:40.160
Go home and do
my English homework?

22:40.160 --> 22:41.200
That's correct.

22:41.200 --> 22:42.720
You're a fine athlete.

22:42.720 --> 22:44.560
Laphonso may have set the record

22:44.560 --> 22:47.520
but you are one of my top ten
students, all-time.

22:50.400 --> 22:52.040
Last class coming up.

22:52.040 --> 22:54.440
Longest 40 minutes
of the day.

22:54.440 --> 22:56.960
You want to come
over to my house after

22:56.960 --> 22:59.240
and study for
our big history test?

22:59.240 --> 23:00.280
Why?

23:00.280 --> 23:02.440
Do you need help
getting ready?

23:05.160 --> 23:07.800
Come on,
seventh period awaits.
