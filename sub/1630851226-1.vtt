01:07.851 --> 01:09.786
They ought to make the day
the time changes

01:09.819 --> 01:11.155
the first day of summer.

01:11.188 --> 01:13.124
- What?
- Well, it's 8:00

01:13.157 --> 01:14.624
and it's still light.

01:14.657 --> 01:15.993
A lot of good
extra daylight does,

01:16.027 --> 01:18.029
we still have
a three-hour drive.

01:18.062 --> 01:19.763
We won't get back
until after midnight.

01:19.796 --> 01:21.165
Well,
if it really bugged you, Johnny,

01:21.198 --> 01:22.967
you wouldn't do it.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.969
You think I wanna blow
a Sunday on a scene like this?

01:25.002 --> 01:26.903
You know,
I figure we're either gonna have

01:26.936 --> 01:29.873
to move Mother out here or move
the grave into Pittsburgh.

01:29.906 --> 01:31.708
She can't make a trip like this.

01:31.741 --> 01:33.110
I don't know that she can't.

01:33.144 --> 01:36.047
Look at this thing,
"We still remember."

01:36.080 --> 01:37.847
I don't.

01:37.881 --> 01:39.216
You know, I don't even remember
what the man looks like.

01:39.250 --> 01:40.884
Johnny,
it takes you five minutes.

01:40.917 --> 01:42.319
Yeah. Five minutes
to put it on the grave,

01:42.353 --> 01:44.288
six hours, back and forth.

01:44.321 --> 01:48.092
Mother wants to remember,
so we trot 200 miles

01:48.125 --> 01:50.593
into the country,
and she stays at home.

01:50.627 --> 01:52.296
Johnny, we're here,
all right?

01:57.834 --> 01:59.702
<i>...back on.</i>

01:59.736 --> 02:01.638
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we are coming back on the air</i>

02:01.671 --> 02:04.075
<i>after an interruption
due to technical problems.</i>

02:04.108 --> 02:05.708
We are...

02:08.745 --> 02:10.314
There's nothing wrong
with the radio.

02:10.347 --> 02:11.614
It must have been the station.

02:11.648 --> 02:14.285
Which row was it in?

02:20.890 --> 02:22.960
I wonder what happened
to the one from last year.

02:22.993 --> 02:24.627
Well, the flowers die,

02:24.661 --> 02:26.964
and the caretaker
or somebody takes them away.

02:26.997 --> 02:29.967
I wonder how many times
we've bought the same one.

02:34.938 --> 02:36.873
Hey, come on, Barb.
Church was this morning, huh?

02:40.077 --> 02:42.645
Hey, I mean,
praying's for church.

02:42.679 --> 02:44.148
Come on.

02:44.181 --> 02:46.117
Well, I haven't
seen you in church lately.

02:46.150 --> 02:49.153
Well, there's not much
sense in my going to church.

02:49.186 --> 02:52.289
Do you remember one time
when we were small,

02:52.323 --> 02:53.756
we were out here?

02:53.790 --> 02:55.192
It was from right over there.

02:55.226 --> 02:57.128
I jumped out at you
from behind the tree,

02:57.161 --> 02:59.296
and grandpa got all excited,
and he shook his fist at me,

02:59.330 --> 03:02.299
and he said,
"Boy, you'll be damned to hell."

03:02.333 --> 03:06.003
Remember that?

03:06.036 --> 03:08.139
Right over there.

03:08.172 --> 03:10.074
You used to really
be scared here.

03:10.107 --> 03:13.310
- Johnny.
- Hey, you're still afraid.

03:13.344 --> 03:16.313
Stop it now. I mean it.

03:16.347 --> 03:19.816
They're coming to get you,
Barbara.

03:19.849 --> 03:22.119
Stop it.
You're ignorant.

03:22.153 --> 03:25.389
They're coming for you,
Barbara.

03:25.422 --> 03:27.757
Stop it. You're acting
like a child.

03:27.790 --> 03:31.295
They're coming for you.

03:31.328 --> 03:33.930
- He'll hear you.
- Here he comes now.

03:33.964 --> 03:36.033
- I'm getting out of here.
- Johnny.

03:42.072 --> 03:45.342
Johnny, help me!

08:12.576 --> 08:14.211
It's all right.

08:22.252 --> 08:24.488
The truck's out of gas.

08:24.521 --> 08:26.123
The pump out there is locked.

08:26.156 --> 08:27.758
Is there a key?

08:27.791 --> 08:29.426
We can try to get out of here
if we can get some gas.

08:29.460 --> 08:31.261
Is there a key?

08:32.729 --> 08:34.530
Do you live here?

08:46.276 --> 08:48.078
Jesus.

08:51.515 --> 08:53.283
We gotta get out of here.

08:53.317 --> 08:55.752
We have to get to where
there's some other people.

09:23.380 --> 09:25.115
What's happening?

09:32.556 --> 09:34.291
Two of them.

09:37.594 --> 09:39.196
There are two of them out there.

09:39.229 --> 09:41.365
- Have you seen any more?
- I don't know.

09:41.398 --> 09:43.233
- I don't know.
- I know you're afraid

09:43.267 --> 09:45.168
- but we have to try.
- I don't know.

09:45.202 --> 09:48.639
I don't know what's happening.

11:39.316 --> 11:41.551
They know we're in here now.

12:00.871 --> 12:02.472
Don't look at it.

12:44.948 --> 12:47.584
Get some more lights
on in this house.

12:54.524 --> 12:55.960
Why don't you see
if we can find some wood,

12:55.993 --> 12:57.928
some boards, something there
by the fireplace,

12:57.962 --> 13:00.530
something we can nail
this place up?

13:06.570 --> 13:08.705
Look, goddamn it!

13:10.640 --> 13:13.710
Look, I know you're afraid.

13:13.744 --> 13:15.345
I'm afraid, too.

13:15.378 --> 13:17.982
But we have to board
the house up together.

13:18.015 --> 13:20.017
We'll be okay here
until someone rescues us,

13:20.051 --> 13:22.285
but we have to work together.

13:22.319 --> 13:26.523
Now, I need you
to get some wood, okay?

13:26.556 --> 13:28.025
Okay?

14:22.779 --> 14:25.983
They're afraid now.
They're afraid of fire.

14:26.017 --> 14:27.952
I found that out.

14:39.396 --> 14:41.765
You know a place back down
the road called Beekman's?

14:41.798 --> 14:43.834
Beekman's Diner?

14:45.970 --> 14:49.439
Anyhow, that's where I found
that truck I have out there.

15:15.099 --> 15:16.968
<i>...back on.</i>

15:17.001 --> 15:18.902
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we are coming back on the air</i>

15:18.935 --> 15:21.671
<i>after an interruption
due to technical problems.</i>

15:21.705 --> 15:24.175
<i>We are hearing some
strange reports coming in.</i>

15:24.208 --> 15:27.844
<i>I'm not quite sure how to...
well, I guess I'll just say it.</i>

15:27.878 --> 15:30.947
<i>There are stories of assaults,
attacks.</i>

15:30.982 --> 15:34.551
<i>People being violently attacked
by strangers.</i>

15:34.584 --> 15:36.887
<i>In some cases,
groups of strangers.</i>

15:36.920 --> 15:41.691
<i>As crazy as it sounds,
there are multiple, many...</i>

15:41.725 --> 15:44.628
<i>I'm sorry, just a moment...</i>

15:56.539 --> 15:58.042
<i>All doors
and windows locked</i>

15:58.075 --> 16:00.543
<i>or boarded shut and...</i>

16:08.052 --> 16:10.820
Hey, get out of there!
It's not...

16:56.866 --> 17:00.004
I realized that I was alone

17:00.037 --> 17:04.108
with 20 or 30 of those things.

17:04.141 --> 17:06.978
I started to drive.

17:07.011 --> 17:09.981
I just plowed
right through them.

17:10.013 --> 17:14.050
They didn't move.
They didn't run.

17:14.085 --> 17:18.289
Just stood there, staring at me.

17:18.321 --> 17:22.059
I just wanted to crush them.

17:22.093 --> 17:24.828
They scattered
through the air like...

17:24.861 --> 17:26.762
bugs.

17:29.599 --> 17:33.536
We were riding in the cemetery.

17:33.570 --> 17:38.242
We came to put a wreath
on my father's grave

17:38.275 --> 17:42.879
and Johnny said, "Oh, it's late.

17:42.912 --> 17:45.149
Why did we start so late?"

17:45.182 --> 17:49.886
And I said, "Johnny, well,
if you'd gotten up earlier,

17:49.919 --> 17:52.622
we wouldn't be late."

17:52.655 --> 17:55.625
Johnny kept teasing me
and saying,

17:55.658 --> 17:59.196
"He's coming to get you,
Barbara!"

17:59.230 --> 18:02.299
And then, Johnny ran away.

18:02.333 --> 18:04.801
Why don't you just keep calm?

18:04.834 --> 18:07.238
And he grabbed me.

18:07.271 --> 18:10.573
He grabbed me
and he ripped at me.

18:10.607 --> 18:13.643
He held me
and he ripped my clothes.

18:14.811 --> 18:18.782
I screamed, "Johnny, help me!"

18:18.815 --> 18:22.319
And Johnny fought this man

18:22.353 --> 18:24.854
and I was so afraid.

18:24.888 --> 18:28.025
I ran, I ran,

18:28.059 --> 18:31.628
and Johnny didn't come.

18:31.661 --> 18:34.065
We'd better go get him.

18:34.098 --> 18:37.667
We have to get Johnny.

18:38.969 --> 18:42.839
Please,
we have to go get Johnny!

18:44.375 --> 18:46.910
My brother is alone.

18:46.943 --> 18:49.013
Your brother is dead.

19:15.805 --> 19:20.144
<i>You... at this hour,
these are the facts,</i>

19:20.177 --> 19:22.213
<i>there is an epidemic
of mass murder</i>

19:22.246 --> 19:25.915
<i>in villages, cities,
rural homes, and suburbs</i>

19:25.949 --> 19:28.718
<i>with no apparent pattern
or reason.</i>

19:28.751 --> 19:31.821
<i>Your law enforcement agencies
urge you to remain</i>

19:31.855 --> 19:34.757
<i>in your homes.</i>

19:34.791 --> 19:37.660
<i>Police, sheriff deputies,
and ambulances</i>

19:37.694 --> 19:39.997
<i>are literally deluged
with calls.</i>

19:40.030 --> 19:41.698
<i>The scene is mayhem.</i>

19:41.731 --> 19:44.068
<i>The governors of several states
have indicated</i>

19:44.101 --> 19:46.170
<i>the National Guard
may be mobilized.</i>

19:46.203 --> 19:49.340
<i>Keep all doors and windows
locked or boarded shut.</i>

19:49.373 --> 19:53.743
<i>Use all food, water,
and medical supplies sparingly.</i>

19:53.776 --> 19:55.745
<i>Do not use your automobile.</i>

19:55.778 --> 19:57.714
<i>Remain in your home.</i>

19:57.747 --> 20:00.050
<i>Keep all doors
and windows locked.</i>

20:00.084 --> 20:04.821
<i>Workers are being urged to stay
at their places of employment.</i>

20:04.854 --> 20:07.158
<i>Civil defense forces
are attempting to gain control</i>

20:07.191 --> 20:09.026
<i>of the situation.</i>

20:09.059 --> 20:12.062
<i>Do not go outside
for any reason.</i>

20:29.746 --> 20:32.882
<i>I repeat,
stay where you are.</i>

20:32.916 --> 20:35.752
<i>This is the emergency
radio network.</i>

20:35.785 --> 20:39.123
<i>Normal broadcast facilities
been temporarily discontinued.</i>

20:39.156 --> 20:42.859
<i>Stay tuned to this wavelength
for emergency information.</i>

20:42.892 --> 20:45.762
<i>Your law enforcement agencies
urge you</i>

20:45.795 --> 20:48.065
<i>to remain in your homes.</i>

20:48.098 --> 20:51.768
<i>Keep all doors and windows
locked or boarded shut.</i>

20:53.404 --> 20:56.806
<i>The president has called
a cabinet meeting.</i>

20:56.839 --> 21:00.411
<i>They will be joined
by the FBI and joint chiefs.</i>

21:00.444 --> 21:02.346
<i>There will be
an official announcement</i>

21:02.379 --> 21:04.814
<i>following the meeting.</i>

21:04.847 --> 21:06.116
<i>The emergency conference</i>

21:06.150 --> 21:08.485
<i>will include scientists
from NASA.</i>

21:08.519 --> 21:10.853
<i>Late reports reaching
this newsroom,</i>

21:10.887 --> 21:14.291
<i>tell of frightened people
seeking refuge in churches,</i>

21:14.325 --> 21:17.228
<i>schools,
and government buildings,</i>

21:17.261 --> 21:19.796
<i>demanding shelter
and protection</i>

21:19.829 --> 21:22.899
<i>from the wholesale murder.</i>

21:22.932 --> 21:25.236
<i>Law enforcement officials
are at a loss...</i>

21:58.569 --> 22:00.404
<i>...what was first documented</i>

22:00.437 --> 22:03.540
<i>in the Midwestern section
of the country...</i>

22:03.574 --> 22:06.277
I found a gun
and some bullets out there.

22:08.145 --> 22:09.980
Oh, and these.

22:10.014 --> 22:11.582
<i>...have been summoned
to the White House.</i>

22:11.615 --> 22:13.384
<i>And reporters on the scene
in Washington</i>

22:13.417 --> 22:15.286
<i>inform us that the president
is planning</i>

22:15.319 --> 22:18.289
<i>to make public the results
of that conference.</i>

22:18.322 --> 22:20.991
<i>It is addressed to the nation
will be your Civil Defense...</i>

22:21.025 --> 22:24.061
This place is boarded up
pretty solid now.

22:24.094 --> 22:26.430
We ought to be all right here
for a while.

22:26.463 --> 22:30.334
We have a gun and bullets,
food, and the radio.

22:30.367 --> 22:32.436
<i>Keep all doors
and windows locked.</i>

22:32.469 --> 22:35.105
Sooner or later, someone's bound
to come and get us out.

22:35.139 --> 22:37.308
<i>We joined
with law enforcement agencies</i>

22:37.341 --> 22:40.244
<i>in urging you to seek shelter
in a building.</i>

22:40.277 --> 22:42.945
<i>Lock the doors
and windows securely.</i>

22:42.980 --> 22:45.549
Hey, that's us.
We're doing all right.

22:45.582 --> 22:48.252
<i>Be cautious
of any suspicious strangers</i>

22:48.285 --> 22:51.055
<i>and keep tuned to your radio
and television</i>

22:51.088 --> 22:54.091
<i>for survival instructions
and further details</i>

22:54.124 --> 22:55.592
- <i>of this continuing story.</i>
- Look,

22:55.626 --> 22:57.860
I don't know
if you're hearing me.

22:57.894 --> 23:00.064
But I'm going upstairs.

23:02.599 --> 23:04.168
If anything should try
to break in,

23:04.201 --> 23:05.636
I'll be down
to take care of it,

23:05.669 --> 23:08.305
but you'll be all right for now,
okay?

23:08.339 --> 23:11.041
<i>...particular
patterns of behavior.</i>

23:11.075 --> 23:14.211
<i>In the few hours following
initial reports of violence</i>

23:14.244 --> 23:16.980
<i>and death and apparently
deranged attacks on the lives</i>

23:17.014 --> 23:19.316
<i>of people taken
completely off guard.</i>

23:19.350 --> 23:22.019
<i>We have heard reports
that officials in Cumberland</i>

23:22.052 --> 23:23.920
<i>told newsmen
that murder victims</i>

23:23.954 --> 23:26.590
<i>show evidence of having been
partially devoured</i>

23:26.623 --> 23:28.525
<i>by their murderers.</i>

23:54.685 --> 23:56.687
<i>Teams of scientists
and physicians</i>

23:56.720 --> 23:59.289
<i>presently have the corpses
of several of the aggressors</i>

23:59.323 --> 24:02.092
<i>and these corpses
are being studied for clues</i>

24:02.126 --> 24:05.295
<i>that might negate
or confirm existing theories.</i>

24:06.697 --> 24:08.565
<i>Repeating
this latest bulletin</i>

24:08.599 --> 24:11.201
<i>and so this incredible story</i>

24:11.235 --> 24:15.305
<i>becomes more ghastly
with each report.</i>

24:15.339 --> 24:17.940
<i>Medical examination
victims' bodies</i>

24:17.975 --> 24:20.077
<i>shows conclusively
that the killers</i>

24:20.110 --> 24:23.347
<i>are eating the flesh
of the people they kill.</i>

24:32.055 --> 24:33.590
Whoa, don't shoot.
We're from town.

24:33.624 --> 24:35.159
A radio.

24:35.192 --> 24:36.226
<i>from urban</i>

24:36.260 --> 24:37.327
<i>and rural areas</i>

24:37.361 --> 24:38.495
<i>throughout the nations.</i>

24:38.529 --> 24:39.663
<i>And if they have not as yet</i>

24:39.696 --> 24:41.131
<i>evidence that</i>

24:41.165 --> 24:42.699
How long you guys
been down there?

24:42.733 --> 24:44.334
I could have used some help.

24:44.368 --> 24:45.636
That's the cellar.
It's the safest place.

24:45.669 --> 24:46.737
You mean
you didn't hear the racket

24:46.770 --> 24:48.071
we was making up here?

24:48.105 --> 24:49.173
How are we supposed to know

24:49.206 --> 24:50.674
what was going on up here?

24:50.707 --> 24:52.009
It could have been those things
for all we knew.

24:52.042 --> 24:53.410
That girl was screaming.

24:53.444 --> 24:55.412
Anybody would have known
somebody needed help.

24:55.446 --> 24:57.748
It's kinda hard to hear
what's going on from down there.

24:57.781 --> 24:59.249
For all we knew,
that could mean those things

24:59.283 --> 25:00.451
were in the house after her.

25:00.484 --> 25:02.119
And you wouldn't come up
and help?

25:02.152 --> 25:03.220
That racket sounded
like the place

25:03.253 --> 25:04.588
was being ripped apart.

25:04.621 --> 25:05.689
How are we supposed to know
what was going on?

25:05.722 --> 25:07.424
Now, wait a minute.

25:07.458 --> 25:08.692
You just got finished saying
you couldn't hear it

25:08.725 --> 25:10.227
from down there.

25:10.260 --> 25:11.328
Now, you say it sounded like
the place

25:11.361 --> 25:13.163
was being ripped apart.

25:13.197 --> 25:15.999
It would be nice if you'd get
your story straight, man.

25:16.033 --> 25:17.568
We luck into a safe place

25:17.601 --> 25:19.369
and you're telling us
that we got to risk our lives

25:19.403 --> 25:21.305
just because somebody
might need help, huh?

25:21.338 --> 25:22.706
Yeah, something like that.

25:22.739 --> 25:24.308
All right.
Why don't we settle this like...

25:24.341 --> 25:26.043
Look, mister, we came up, okay?

25:26.076 --> 25:27.544
We're here.

25:27.578 --> 25:29.413
Now, I suggest we all go back
downstairs before

25:29.446 --> 25:31.014
any of those things find out
we're in here.

25:31.048 --> 25:32.416
They can't get in here.

25:32.449 --> 25:34.284
Oh, you got
the whole place boarded up?

25:34.318 --> 25:36.286
Yeah, all
but a few spots upstairs.

25:36.320 --> 25:37.754
They won't be hard to fix.

25:37.788 --> 25:39.723
You're insane.
The cellar's the safest place.

25:39.756 --> 25:41.525
I'm telling you,
they can't get in here.

25:41.558 --> 25:43.627
And I'm telling you those things
turned over our car.

25:43.660 --> 25:45.095
Now, you tell me
they can't get through

25:45.128 --> 25:46.663
this lousy pile of wood?

25:46.697 --> 25:48.599
<i>...is indeed spread
across the nation</i>

25:48.632 --> 25:50.334
<i>and it's</i>

25:50.367 --> 25:53.504
His wife and kid's downstairs,
the kid's hurt.

25:53.537 --> 25:57.608
Well, I still think
we're better off up here.

25:57.641 --> 26:00.310
We could strengthen
everything up, Mr. Cooper.

26:00.344 --> 26:01.712
With all of us working,

26:01.745 --> 26:03.213
we could fix this place up
in no time.

26:03.247 --> 26:04.648
We have everything
we need up here.

26:04.681 --> 26:07.050
We can take
all that stuff downstairs.

26:07.084 --> 26:09.219
Man, you are really crazy,
you know that?

26:09.253 --> 26:10.787
You got a million windows
up here.

26:10.821 --> 26:12.222
You're gonna make them
strong enough

26:12.256 --> 26:13.690
to keep these things out, huh?

26:13.724 --> 26:15.492
I told you, those things
don't have any strength.

26:15.526 --> 26:17.794
I smashed three and pushed
another one out the door.

26:17.828 --> 26:19.663
Did you hear me?

26:19.696 --> 26:22.466
I told you
they turned over our car.

26:22.499 --> 26:24.601
Oh, hell, any good
five men could do that.

26:24.635 --> 26:26.169
That's my point.

26:26.203 --> 26:27.771
Only there's not gonna be
five or even ten.

26:27.804 --> 26:30.741
There's gonna be 20, 30,
maybe a hundred of those things.

26:30.774 --> 26:32.576
This place is gonna be
crawling with them.

26:32.609 --> 26:34.144
Well, if there's that many,

26:34.177 --> 26:37.147
they'll probably get us
wherever we are.

26:37.180 --> 26:39.316
Look, the cellar.

26:39.349 --> 26:40.751
There's just one door, right?

26:40.784 --> 26:42.119
Just one door.

26:42.152 --> 26:44.121
That's all we have to protect.

26:44.154 --> 26:45.322
Tom and I fixed it,
so it locks

26:45.355 --> 26:47.157
and boards from the inside.

26:47.190 --> 26:48.825
You got a point,
Mr. Cooper.

26:48.859 --> 26:51.295
But down in the cellar,
there's no place to run to.

26:51.328 --> 26:54.464
I mean, if they did get in,
there'd be no back exit.

26:54.498 --> 26:56.767
We'd be done for.

26:56.800 --> 26:58.869
We can get out of here
if we have to.

26:58.902 --> 27:01.305
And we got windows to see
what's going on outside.

27:01.338 --> 27:04.508
But down there, with no windows,
if a rescue did come,

27:04.541 --> 27:06.176
we wouldn't even know it.

27:06.209 --> 27:08.111
But the cellar
is the strongest place.

27:08.145 --> 27:10.314
The cellar
is a death trap.

27:10.347 --> 27:12.716
I don't know, Mr. Cooper.
I think he's right.

27:12.749 --> 27:16.620
Look, you two can do
whatever you like.

27:16.653 --> 27:18.589
I'm going back down
to the cellar

27:18.622 --> 27:21.825
and I'm not gonna unlock it
again no matter what happens.

27:21.858 --> 27:23.894
- Now, wait a minute, Mr. Cooper.
- No, I'm not gonna wait!

27:23.927 --> 27:25.796
I've made my decision,
now you make yours.

27:25.829 --> 27:27.631
I said, wait a minute!

27:27.664 --> 27:30.300
Let's think about this.

27:30.334 --> 27:32.502
We can make it to the cellar
if we have to.

27:32.536 --> 27:35.572
If we decide to stay down there,
we'll need things from up here.

27:35.606 --> 27:38.241
Let's at least consider it.

27:39.610 --> 27:41.244
If you box yourself
in the cellar

27:41.278 --> 27:42.245
and those things
get in the house,

27:42.279 --> 27:43.714
you've had it.

27:43.747 --> 27:45.349
At least up here,
you have a fighting chance.

27:49.620 --> 27:51.855
Looks like about eight
or ten of them now.

27:51.888 --> 27:53.857
That's more than there were.

27:53.890 --> 27:55.626
There's a lot out back, too.

28:30.360 --> 28:32.396
Harry!

28:32.429 --> 28:33.563
Harry, what's happening?

28:33.597 --> 28:34.865
It's all right!

29:14.304 --> 29:16.506
- We gotta fix these boards.
- Are you crazy?

29:16.540 --> 29:17.841
Those things are gonna
be at every window

29:17.874 --> 29:19.309
and every door in this place.

29:19.342 --> 29:20.911
We've gotta get down
into the cellar.

29:20.944 --> 29:24.015
Go down in your damn cellar
and get out of here!

29:24.048 --> 29:25.882
I... I'm taking the girl with me.

29:25.916 --> 29:28.485
Keep your hands off of her
and everything else up here.

29:28.518 --> 29:31.488
If I stay up here, I'm fighting
for everything up here,

29:31.521 --> 29:33.390
the radio and the food
is part of that.

29:33.423 --> 29:36.493
The man's insane.
He's insane.

29:36.526 --> 29:37.962
We've gotta
have food down there.

29:37.995 --> 29:39.629
We've got a right.

29:39.663 --> 29:40.998
- Is this your house?
- We've got a right!

29:41.032 --> 29:42.933
You're going down there
with him?

29:42.967 --> 29:44.801
- Well, I...
- Yes or no?

29:44.835 --> 29:46.336
Listen, I've got
a kid down there.

29:46.369 --> 29:47.771
She can't possibly
take those things,

29:47.804 --> 29:49.506
smashing through the windows?

29:49.539 --> 29:51.475
If you're stupid enough
to go die in that trap,

29:51.508 --> 29:52.977
that's your business.

29:53.010 --> 29:55.746
However, I am not stupid enough
to follow you.

29:55.779 --> 29:58.849
It's tough for the kid
that her old man is so stupid.

29:58.882 --> 30:00.951
Now, get the hell down
in the cellar.

30:00.985 --> 30:02.452
Go be boss down there.

30:02.486 --> 30:04.321
I'm boss up here.

30:04.354 --> 30:05.856
Bastards!

30:05.889 --> 30:08.325
You know, I won't open
this door again, I mean it.

30:08.358 --> 30:09.893
Mr. Cooper, with your help...

30:09.926 --> 30:12.029
Let him go.
His mind's made up.

30:13.330 --> 30:14.931
Wait a minute!

30:17.734 --> 30:18.802
Judy?

30:18.835 --> 30:20.337
Come on up here, honey.

30:26.110 --> 30:28.411
You're gonna let them
get her, too?

30:28.445 --> 30:30.947
It's all right, honey.
Go ahead.

30:46.363 --> 30:48.398
Well, we're safe now.

30:48.431 --> 30:50.400
It's boarded up tight.

30:50.433 --> 30:51.735
What about Tom and Judy?

30:51.768 --> 30:53.537
They wanna stay up there,
let 'em.

30:55.906 --> 30:59.609
There are two other people
upstairs.

30:59.643 --> 31:00.844
A man and a girl.

31:00.877 --> 31:02.779
We heard the screaming.

31:02.813 --> 31:04.514
Yeah.

31:04.548 --> 31:07.551
I wasn't about to take
any unnecessary chances.

31:07.584 --> 31:08.852
Of course not, Harry.

31:14.691 --> 31:16.626
Where did you get the bandage?

31:16.660 --> 31:17.995
Laundry in a basket.

31:18.029 --> 31:19.529
I tore up a sheet.

31:28.072 --> 31:31.842
Let 'em stay upstairs.
Let 'em.

31:31.875 --> 31:35.012
Too many ways those monsters
can get in up there.

31:35.046 --> 31:36.646
We'll see who's right.

31:36.680 --> 31:38.515
Yeah, we'll see,
when they come begging me

31:38.548 --> 31:40.417
- to let them in down here.
- That's important, isn't it?

31:40.450 --> 31:41.818
- What?
- To be right,

31:41.852 --> 31:43.854
everybody else to be wrong.

31:43.887 --> 31:45.822
What do you mean by that?

31:49.026 --> 31:52.997
Does anyone up there know
why we're being attacked?

31:53.030 --> 31:55.099
Whatever it is,
it isn't just happening here.

31:55.132 --> 31:56.666
It's some kind of mass murder.

31:56.700 --> 31:58.869
It's going on everywhere.

31:58.902 --> 32:00.403
The radio said to stay inside...

32:00.437 --> 32:01.771
Radio?

32:01.805 --> 32:03.140
There's a radio upstairs.

32:03.174 --> 32:04.774
I heard the news bulletin.

32:04.808 --> 32:07.078
There's a radio upstairs
and you boarded us in

32:07.111 --> 32:08.745
- down here?
- I know what I'm doing.

32:08.778 --> 32:10.814
- What did it say?
- Nothing! Nothing.

32:10.847 --> 32:13.550
They don't know anything yet.

32:13.583 --> 32:15.685
People are supposed to look
for a safe place to hide.

32:15.719 --> 32:18.189
Take the board off that door!

32:18.222 --> 32:20.124
We are staying down here, Helen!

32:20.157 --> 32:23.526
Harry, that radio
is at least some communication.

32:23.560 --> 32:25.129
If the authorities know
what's happening,

32:25.162 --> 32:28.832
they'll send people or, or,
or tell us what to do.

32:28.865 --> 32:32.802
How are we gonna know if we lock
ourselves in this dungeon?

32:43.180 --> 32:46.117
We may not enjoy
living together,

32:46.150 --> 32:49.552
but dying together
isn't going to solve anything.

32:49.586 --> 32:52.555
Those people aren't our enemies.

32:52.589 --> 32:55.226
Mr. Cooper!
Mr. Cooper,

32:55.259 --> 32:57.894
Ben found a television set
upstairs.

33:00.231 --> 33:02.565
- Tom?
- Yeah?

33:02.599 --> 33:05.535
If Judy comes down
for a few minutes,

33:05.568 --> 33:08.072
Harry and I can come up.

33:09.940 --> 33:11.841
Nothing's gonna get done
with them down there

33:11.875 --> 33:13.643
and us up here.

33:13.677 --> 33:15.712
Do this, for me.

33:15.745 --> 33:18.848
- Okay.
- Okay, open up.

33:37.134 --> 33:40.071
I'll take
good care of her, Helen.

33:42.539 --> 33:44.208
She's all I have.

33:54.851 --> 33:57.154
Her brother was killed.

33:57.188 --> 34:00.557
Hey! Give me
a hand with this thing.

34:00.590 --> 34:03.593
I, I gotta help Ben
with the television.

34:23.580 --> 34:25.149
Oh, don't be afraid of me.

34:25.181 --> 34:28.284
I'm Helen Cooper, Harry's wife.

34:33.190 --> 34:34.657
This place is ridiculous.

34:34.690 --> 34:36.260
There's a million
weak spots up here.

34:36.293 --> 34:37.860
And they talk
about these windows.

34:37.893 --> 34:39.629
I can't see a damn thing.

34:39.661 --> 34:41.966
There could be 15 million
of those things out there.

34:41.998 --> 34:43.833
That's how much
good these windows are.

34:45.235 --> 34:47.737
Drag a couple
of those chairs together.

34:55.379 --> 34:56.646
<i>However,
the reports...</i>

34:56.679 --> 34:58.215
It's on!
It's on!

34:58.249 --> 34:59.783
<i>reports,
incredible as they seem,</i>

34:59.816 --> 35:01.252
<i>are not the results
of mass hysteria.</i>

35:01.285 --> 35:02.886
"Mass hysteria."

35:02.919 --> 35:04.188
What do they think,
we're imagining all this?

35:04.221 --> 35:05.855
Shut up!

35:05.889 --> 35:07.757
This is
the latest disclosure

35:07.791 --> 35:10.660
from National Civil Defense
headquarters in Washington.

35:10.693 --> 35:12.629
<i>Civil Defense machinery
has been organized</i>

35:12.662 --> 35:14.697
<i>to provide rescue
stations with food,</i>

35:14.731 --> 35:17.034
shelter, medical treatment,
and protection

35:17.068 --> 35:18.969
by armed National Guardsmen...

35:19.003 --> 35:20.670
We have that truck.

35:20.703 --> 35:21.938
If we can get some gas,
we can get outta here.

35:21.972 --> 35:22.973
There's a pump outside.

35:23.007 --> 35:24.341
I know.

35:24.375 --> 35:25.842
That's why I pulled in here,
but it's locked.

35:25.875 --> 35:27.011
Why are space experts
being consulted

35:27.044 --> 35:28.845
about an earthbound
emergency?

35:28.878 --> 35:30.680
So far, all the betting
on the answer

35:30.713 --> 35:33.017
to that question centers
on the recent explorer

35:33.050 --> 35:34.884
satellite shot to Venus.

35:34.918 --> 35:36.886
It's obvious. Our best move
is to try to get out of here.

35:36.920 --> 35:39.356
- How are you gonna get over to that pump?
- Look!

35:39.390 --> 35:41.058
<i>You're coming from
a meeting regarding the</i>

35:41.092 --> 35:42.259
<i>explosion of the Venus probe,
is that right?</i>

35:42.293 --> 35:43.660
- Uh, yes.
- Yes, yes,

35:43.693 --> 35:45.129
that was the subject
of the meeting.

35:45.162 --> 35:46.663
<i>Do you feel
there is a connection</i>

35:46.696 --> 35:48.265
<i>between this
and the phenomenon?</i>

35:48.299 --> 35:49.699
There's a definite connection,
a definite connection.

35:49.732 --> 35:51.035
<i>In other words,
you feel</i>

35:51.068 --> 35:52.369
<i>that the radiation
on the Venus probe</i>

35:52.403 --> 35:53.404
<i>is enough
to cause these mutations?</i>

35:53.437 --> 35:54.972
<i>Just a minute.</i>

35:55.005 --> 35:56.639
<i>I'm not sure
that that's certain at all.</i>

35:56.673 --> 35:57.941
<i>Well,
it is the military's view</i>

35:57.975 --> 35:59.043
<i>that the radiation
is not the cause</i>

35:59.076 --> 36:00.411
<i>of the mutation.</i>

36:00.444 --> 36:03.180
We're, we're doing
everything possible to,

36:03.214 --> 36:04.982
to solve the problem.

36:05.015 --> 36:06.950
<i>Stay tuned
to the broadcasting stations</i>

36:06.984 --> 36:09.153
<i>in your local area for this
list of rescue stations.</i>

36:09.186 --> 36:10.653
We've heard
all we need to know.

36:10.687 --> 36:12.056
We have to try to get out
of here.

36:12.089 --> 36:14.125
He said the rescue stations
have doctors

36:14.158 --> 36:15.859
and medical supplies.

36:15.892 --> 36:18.429
If we can get Karen there,
we can get help for her.

36:18.462 --> 36:19.929
We have one
of the world's authorities

36:19.964 --> 36:21.731
on space sciences
and technology.

36:21.764 --> 36:24.135
Willard.
I saw a sign that said Willard.

36:24.168 --> 36:26.337
It's only about
17 miles from here.

36:26.370 --> 36:27.837
You know this area.

36:27.871 --> 36:29.772
Yeah, Judy and I
are both from here.

36:29.806 --> 36:32.876
We were on our way to the lake
when we heard the reports.

36:32.909 --> 36:36.313
And we knew this house was here
and then these people came

36:36.347 --> 36:38.015
and we went into the basement.

36:38.048 --> 36:40.017
How could we possibly get away?

36:40.050 --> 36:42.186
We've got three men, two women,
a sick child,

36:42.219 --> 36:44.421
and another woman out
of her head.

36:44.455 --> 36:46.357
And the place is surrounded
by those things.

36:46.390 --> 36:48.192
Dr. Grimes is a special
consultant for NASA.

36:48.225 --> 36:50.227
Dr. Grimes,
your entire staff,

36:50.261 --> 36:53.097
I know, has been working
very hard to find some solution

36:53.130 --> 36:54.731
to these things
that are happening.

36:54.764 --> 36:56.367
Do you have any answers
at this time?

36:56.400 --> 36:58.202
We have some answers,

36:58.235 --> 37:00.204
but let me stress
the importance of seeking

37:00.237 --> 37:03.706
medical attention for anyone
who's been injured.

37:03.740 --> 37:05.976
<i>We don't know what
complications might result</i>

37:06.010 --> 37:07.877
<i>from these injuries.</i>

37:07.911 --> 37:11.048
- It has been established...
- How bad has your kid been hurt?

37:11.081 --> 37:14.018
Um, she...

37:16.187 --> 37:17.787
Tell Judy to come up here
so you can stay

37:17.820 --> 37:19.390
with your kid, all right?

37:19.423 --> 37:21.225
<i>Destructive action
taken with regard</i>

37:21.258 --> 37:22.892
<i>to the Venus probe.</i>

37:22.926 --> 37:24.395
In the cold room
at the university,

37:24.428 --> 37:27.231
we had a cadaver,
a cadaver from which all

37:27.264 --> 37:29.400
four limbs
had been amputated.

37:29.433 --> 37:31.768
This morning,
it opened its eyes.

37:31.801 --> 37:35.472
It was dead, but it opened
its eyes and tried to move.

37:37.508 --> 37:39.909
They want you upstairs.

37:46.083 --> 37:48.185
I'll come back down
as soon as I find out

37:48.219 --> 37:49.886
what they want.

37:49.919 --> 37:52.323
Thank you, Judy.

37:52.356 --> 37:54.291
The bodies
should be disposed of at once,

37:54.325 --> 37:55.758
preferably by cremation.

37:55.792 --> 37:57.428
Well, how long after death then

37:57.461 --> 37:59.463
does the body become
reactivated?

37:59.496 --> 38:01.198
It's only a matter of minutes.

38:01.232 --> 38:02.799
Minutes?

38:02.832 --> 38:04.134
That doesn't leave much time
to make arrangements.

38:04.168 --> 38:05.768
No, you're right.
It doesn't give them time

38:05.802 --> 38:07.770
to make funeral arrangements.

38:07.804 --> 38:09.906
The bodies must be carried
to the street and,

38:09.939 --> 38:11.874
and, and
burned immediately.

38:11.908 --> 38:14.777
Soak them with gasoline
and burn them.

38:14.811 --> 38:16.813
<i>It has been established that...</i>

38:16.846 --> 38:19.083
Judy, I need you to find sheets
to tear into small strips, okay?

38:19.116 --> 38:21.418
- Okay.
- We need some bottles or jars

38:21.452 --> 38:23.120
to make Molotov cocktails.

38:23.153 --> 38:24.821
Hey! There's a big can
of kerosene down there.

38:24.854 --> 38:26.090
I'll see
what I can find.

38:26.123 --> 38:28.292
I'll look for bottles.

38:28.325 --> 38:30.961
There's, uh, uh,
a big key ring down there.

38:30.995 --> 38:32.396
The key to the gas pump may
be on it.

38:32.429 --> 38:34.231
I'll check.

38:34.265 --> 38:36.433
We can toss the cocktails
from a window upstairs.

38:36.467 --> 38:39.169
Meantime, some of us can go out
and try to get the gas,

38:39.203 --> 38:40.971
and then we can come back
for the rest of the people.

38:41.005 --> 38:42.939
That'll leave
a door open someplace.

38:42.973 --> 38:45.376
Yeah, that's right.
This door.

38:45.409 --> 38:47.077
It's closer to the truck.

38:47.111 --> 38:49.046
We'll put some supplies
behind the cellar door.

38:49.079 --> 38:51.382
While we're gone, the rest
of you can hole up in there.

38:51.415 --> 38:54.385
I found some jars
and there's a key on here

38:54.418 --> 38:56.387
that's labeled
for the gas pump out back.

38:56.420 --> 38:58.055
I'm not really
that used to the truck.

38:58.088 --> 38:59.323
I found it abandoned.

38:59.356 --> 39:01.959
I can handle the truck,
no sweat.

39:01.992 --> 39:05.362
You're it, then.
You and I will go.

39:05.396 --> 39:08.065
<i>Will come back
to life to seek human victims,</i>

39:08.098 --> 39:10.900
<i>unless their bodies are
first disposed of by cremation.</i>

39:10.933 --> 39:12.336
You can go upstairs
and toss the cocktails

39:12.369 --> 39:14.038
from a window.

39:14.071 --> 39:15.938
After we get the gas and back
into the house,

39:15.973 --> 39:18.108
then we'll worry about getting
everybody into the truck.

39:19.543 --> 39:21.478
<i>No place to flee
for safety,</i>

39:21.512 --> 39:24.281
<i>except for the rescue stations
which have been set up.</i>

39:24.315 --> 39:27.051
Indications are that
before this emergency is over,

39:27.084 --> 39:30.454
we will need many,
many more such rescue stations.

39:30.487 --> 39:31.588
That's all for now.

39:31.622 --> 39:33.357
Stay tuned to this channel.

39:33.390 --> 39:35.326
We'll be back live at 3:00 AM.

39:35.359 --> 39:37.094
Stay safe out there.

39:45.402 --> 39:47.604
You always have
that smile for me.

39:47.638 --> 39:51.608
How can you smile
like that all the time?

39:51.642 --> 39:54.111
Okay.
How many do you have done?

39:57.181 --> 40:00.184
Tom, are you sure
about the phone?

40:00.217 --> 40:02.186
The phone is dead.

40:02.219 --> 40:03.954
If I could only call the folks.

40:03.987 --> 40:06.256
They're going to be
so worried about us.

40:06.290 --> 40:07.624
Everything's gonna be okay.

40:07.658 --> 40:09.226
As soon as we get to Willard,

40:09.259 --> 40:11.462
we'll call them.
They might even be there.

40:11.495 --> 40:13.664
Tom, are you sure
we're doing the right thing?

40:13.697 --> 40:15.532
What, about getting out
of here?

40:15.566 --> 40:17.034
Yeah.

40:17.067 --> 40:18.168
Well, the television
said we've got to get

40:18.202 --> 40:19.370
to a rescue station.

40:19.403 --> 40:21.238
- I don't know.
- Oh, come on.

40:21.271 --> 40:23.407
You're starting
to sound like Mr. Cooper now.

40:23.440 --> 40:25.142
But why do you have
to go out there?

40:25.175 --> 40:27.177
Because I know
how to handle that truck

40:27.211 --> 40:28.579
and I can handle the pump.

40:28.612 --> 40:30.913
Ben doesn't know anything
about that stuff.

40:30.947 --> 40:32.583
But we're safe in here.

40:32.616 --> 40:34.318
We're safe now.

40:34.351 --> 40:36.019
But there's gonna be more
and more of those things.

40:36.053 --> 40:37.688
I know all that.

40:40.324 --> 40:42.526
Remember when we had
the big flood?

40:42.559 --> 40:45.129
Remember how difficult
it was for us to convince you

40:45.162 --> 40:46.530
that it was right to leave?

40:48.298 --> 40:50.134
This isn't a passing thing.

40:50.167 --> 40:52.902
We've got to do something
and fast.

40:56.039 --> 41:00.344
I just don't want you
to go out there, that's all.

41:02.346 --> 41:05.682
Hey, smile, honey.

41:05.716 --> 41:08.585
Where's that big smile for me?

41:17.461 --> 41:19.630
We better get her
downstairs.

41:21.732 --> 41:24.568
We have to go
downstairs now, Barbara.

41:29.206 --> 41:31.742
She's right.
We have to go downstairs.

41:31.775 --> 41:34.745
Just for a little while,
then we can all leave.

41:34.778 --> 41:37.080
Oh, I'd like to leave.

41:37.114 --> 41:38.282
Yes.

41:51.128 --> 41:53.597
- Good luck.
- Yeah.

42:31.435 --> 42:32.669
You ready upstairs?

42:34.304 --> 42:35.405
Yeah.

42:35.439 --> 42:37.341
Okay. Toss them!

42:55.359 --> 42:57.127
Go ahead!
Go. Go!

43:16.380 --> 43:18.315
Get back in the cellar!

43:18.348 --> 43:20.183
I'm going.

43:29.860 --> 43:34.197
If you're coming, come on.
Get in.

44:40.597 --> 44:43.133
- Come on.
- The keys don't work.

44:57.714 --> 44:58.882
Watch the torch!

45:06.490 --> 45:08.358
We've gotta get away
from the pump!

45:12.529 --> 45:13.764
Just hang on.

45:17.334 --> 45:19.569
Tom!
Get out of the truck.

45:22.806 --> 45:24.574
Oh...

45:25.709 --> 45:28.679
Come on.
Let's get outta here.

45:28.712 --> 45:29.813
Come on.
Come on!

45:29.846 --> 45:31.481
My jacket's caught.

45:33.617 --> 45:34.651
Tom, help me!

46:41.384 --> 46:45.422
Cooper!
Let me in.

46:46.857 --> 46:48.458
Cooper!

46:49.994 --> 46:51.361
Cooper!

46:52.829 --> 46:54.431
Let me in.

47:32.702 --> 47:35.739
I wanna drag you out there
and feed you to those things!

48:47.979 --> 48:51.514
Isn't it 3:00 yet?

48:51.548 --> 48:54.118
There's supposed to be
another broadcast at 3:00.

48:55.019 --> 48:56.586
Ten minutes.

48:56.620 --> 48:57.888
Oh.

48:57.921 --> 49:00.657
Only ten more minutes?

49:00.690 --> 49:03.127
We don't have very long to wait.

49:03.160 --> 49:05.495
We can leave

49:05.528 --> 49:07.464
or we better leave soon.

49:07.497 --> 49:09.399
It's 10 minutes to 3:00.

49:11.701 --> 49:14.205
You know anything
about this area at all?

49:14.238 --> 49:15.739
Is Willard the nearest town?

49:15.772 --> 49:17.941
I don't know.

49:17.975 --> 49:21.478
We were...

49:21.511 --> 49:25.849
just trying to get to a motel
before dark.

49:25.882 --> 49:27.851
You said those things
turned over your car.

49:27.884 --> 49:29.753
You think we can get it back
on its wheels?

49:29.786 --> 49:31.688
- Where is it?
- Forget it.

49:31.721 --> 49:33.490
It's at least a mile.

49:33.523 --> 49:34.824
Johnny has the keys.

49:34.858 --> 49:36.760
You're gonna carry
that child a mile

49:36.793 --> 49:38.595
through that army of things
out there?

49:38.628 --> 49:40.197
I can carry the kid.

49:40.231 --> 49:42.133
What's wrong with her?
How did she get hurt?

49:42.166 --> 49:44.035
One of those things grabbed her.

49:44.068 --> 49:45.468
Bit her on the arm.

49:47.138 --> 49:49.073
- What's wrong?
- Who knows what diseases

49:49.106 --> 49:51.008
those things carry?

49:51.042 --> 49:53.144
- Is she conscious?
- Barely.

49:53.177 --> 49:55.012
She can't walk.
She's too weak.

49:56.780 --> 49:59.716
Well, one of us could try
to get to the car.

49:59.749 --> 50:02.519
You're gonna turn it over
by yourself?

50:02.552 --> 50:06.223
You can't start the car.
Johnny has the keys.

50:10.027 --> 50:11.228
You have a car?

50:11.262 --> 50:12.829
Where? Where is it?

50:12.862 --> 50:14.564
You won't be able to start it.

50:14.597 --> 50:15.699
Yeah. Yeah. I know.

50:15.732 --> 50:18.002
Where is it?

50:29.646 --> 50:31.248
Good lord.

50:33.084 --> 50:34.818
News cameras have just returned

50:34.851 --> 50:36.553
from a search and destroy
operation.

50:36.586 --> 50:38.822
This one conducted
by Sheriff Conan McClelland

50:38.855 --> 50:40.523
in Butler County, Pennsylvania.

50:40.557 --> 50:43.060
<i>All law enforcement agencies
and the military</i>

50:43.094 --> 50:44.761
<i>have been organized
to search out</i>

50:44.794 --> 50:46.730
<i>and destroy
the marauding ghouls.</i>

50:46.763 --> 50:49.133
<i>A ghoul can be killed
by a shot in the head</i>

50:49.166 --> 50:51.135
<i>or a heavy blow to the skull.</i>

50:51.168 --> 50:53.104
<i>Officials are quoted
as explaining</i>

50:53.137 --> 50:55.172
<i>that since the brain
of a ghoul has been activated</i>

50:55.206 --> 50:56.773
<i>by the radiation,</i>

50:56.806 --> 50:59.210
<i>kill the brain
and you kill the ghoul.</i>

50:59.243 --> 51:01.178
Chief McClelland,
how's everything going?

51:01.212 --> 51:04.048
Oh, things aren't going too bad.
Men are taking it pretty good.

51:04.081 --> 51:06.583
You wanna get on the other side
of the road over there.

51:06.616 --> 51:08.718
Chief, do you think we'll be
able to defeat these things?

51:08.752 --> 51:11.255
Well, we killed 19 of them today
right in this area.

51:11.288 --> 51:13.224
Those last three we caught
trying to claw their way

51:13.257 --> 51:14.891
into an abandoned shed.

51:14.924 --> 51:16.093
They must have thought
somebody was in there.

51:16.127 --> 51:17.694
There wasn't though.

51:17.727 --> 51:19.096
We heard them making
all kinds of noise.

51:19.130 --> 51:20.597
We came over and beat them off,

51:20.630 --> 51:22.033
- blasted them down.
- Chief,

51:22.066 --> 51:23.800
as soon as you're finished,
can I see you here?

51:23.833 --> 51:25.902
- Yeah, okay.
- Chief, if I were surrounded

51:25.935 --> 51:27.171
by six or eight of these things,

51:27.204 --> 51:28.339
would I stand a chance
with them?

51:28.372 --> 51:29.906
Well, there's no problem.

51:29.939 --> 51:31.242
If you had a gun,
shoot them in the head.

51:31.275 --> 51:32.742
That's a sure way to kill them.

51:32.776 --> 51:34.011
If you don't,
get yourself a club

51:34.045 --> 51:35.745
or a torch.
Beat them or burn them.

51:35.779 --> 51:37.647
- They go up pretty easy.
- Well, Chief McClelland,

51:37.680 --> 51:39.050
how long do you think it'll take

51:39.083 --> 51:41.018
until you get the situation
under control?

51:41.052 --> 51:42.319
Well, that's pretty hard to say.

51:42.353 --> 51:44.155
When we find them,
we can kill them.

51:44.188 --> 51:45.688
We'll be at it
most of the night,

51:45.722 --> 51:47.124
probably into the early morning.

51:47.158 --> 51:48.993
We're working our way to Willard
and we'll team up

51:49.026 --> 51:50.827
with the National Guard
over there,

51:50.860 --> 51:52.862
then we'll be able to give
a more definite view.

51:56.833 --> 51:58.335
Is the fuse box in the cellar?

52:02.872 --> 52:05.742
It isn't the fuse,
the power lines are down.

52:06.743 --> 52:07.877
Helen?

52:07.911 --> 52:09.313
I have to get that gun.

52:09.346 --> 52:12.083
Haven't you had enough?

52:12.116 --> 52:14.251
Two people are dead already
because of that guy.

52:14.285 --> 52:17.221
Look out the window.

52:53.023 --> 52:54.858
Get over here, man!

52:56.127 --> 52:57.861
Come on!

53:08.205 --> 53:10.374
Go ahead. Go ahead.

53:10.407 --> 53:12.409
You wanna stay up here now, huh?

53:12.443 --> 53:14.211
Helen, get in the cellar.

53:15.945 --> 53:17.947
I said get in the cellar, now!

53:17.982 --> 53:21.684
Move!

54:33.790 --> 54:35.259
Karen.

54:40.097 --> 54:41.432
Karen.

54:46.836 --> 54:48.505
Karen.

54:48.539 --> 54:50.341
Oh, my goodness.

54:50.374 --> 54:54.245
Karen, oh, no.

54:54.278 --> 54:56.946
Oh, my poor baby.

55:25.209 --> 55:27.544
No! No!

55:31.081 --> 55:34.485
No! Johnny, no!

55:34.518 --> 55:38.322
No!

55:38.355 --> 55:41.191
No! Johnny!

58:02.499 --> 58:04.301
Hey, Vince!

58:04.334 --> 58:06.503
You wanna get about four,
five men and a couple dogs?

58:06.537 --> 58:08.372
There's a house over there
behind those trees.

58:08.405 --> 58:09.640
We wanna go check it out.

58:09.673 --> 58:11.241
You still here, Bill?

58:11.275 --> 58:12.576
Yeah, Chief,
we're going to stay with it

58:12.609 --> 58:14.311
until we meet up
with the National Guard.

58:14.344 --> 58:16.146
- Where did you get coffee?
- One of the volunteers.

58:16.180 --> 58:17.714
You're doing all the work,
you take it.

58:17.748 --> 58:19.483
Thank you.
We should be wrapped up here

58:19.516 --> 58:21.051
about three or four more hours,

58:21.084 --> 58:22.352
we'll probably get
into Willard's end.

58:22.386 --> 58:23.487
I guess you can go over there

58:23.520 --> 58:26.557
and meet the National Guard.

58:26.590 --> 58:29.059
Nick, you and the rest
of these men wanna come with me?

59:02.459 --> 59:04.161
They need you down there
by the barn.

59:04.194 --> 59:06.129
You guys can follow
the wagon down.

59:06.163 --> 59:08.665
I only need a few men
to check out the house.

59:11.134 --> 59:13.203
Somebody had a cookout here,
Vince.

59:13.237 --> 59:15.272
Sure looks like it, Con.

59:45.335 --> 59:47.070
He's a dead one. Get up here.

59:47.104 --> 59:48.739
Nick, Tony, Steve,

59:48.772 --> 59:51.642
you wanna get out in that field
and build me a bonfire?

01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:06.423
Drag that out of here
and throw it on the fire.

01:00:06.456 --> 01:00:08.191
- Nothing down here.
- All right.

01:00:08.225 --> 01:00:09.826
Go ahead down
and give 'em a hand.

01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:11.395
Let's go check out the house.

01:00:11.428 --> 01:00:12.629
There's something in there.

01:00:12.663 --> 01:00:14.398
I heard a noise.

01:00:21.638 --> 01:00:23.106
All right, Vince.
Hit him in the head.

01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:24.775
Right between the eyes.

01:00:30.447 --> 01:00:31.748
Good shot.

01:00:31.782 --> 01:00:33.784
Okay, he's dead.
Let's go get him.

01:00:33.817 --> 01:00:35.652
That's another one for the fire.

01:00:47.631 --> 01:00:49.199
Have we located the boy?

01:00:49.232 --> 01:00:51.201
And that's his mother
up there, right?

01:00:51.234 --> 01:00:52.803
There's more down
in the cellar.

01:00:59.343 --> 01:01:01.478
<i>All right.
In the wagon, sir.</i>

01:01:01.511 --> 01:01:03.580
Chief, there might be
something to look at over here.

01:01:03.614 --> 01:01:05.382
<i>Hey, keep those dogs
off those things.</i>

01:01:05.415 --> 01:01:07.284
You might wanna move
her back a little bit,

01:01:07.317 --> 01:01:09.553
- we're gonna bring him up there.
- <i>Yeah, we're gonna need</i>

01:01:09.586 --> 01:01:11.922
<i>some extra hooks in here, over.</i>

01:01:11.956 --> 01:01:13.890
Careful,
we gotta pile them on there.

01:01:13.924 --> 01:01:15.859
I need someone to give me
a hand with this one.

01:01:15.892 --> 01:01:17.928
<i>Roger,
we're still in the house over.</i>

01:01:32.209 --> 01:01:35.479
another
waste of good shovels although.

01:01:35.512 --> 01:01:38.281
You got a light?

01:01:38.315 --> 01:01:41.518
Here, I got you.

01:01:41.551 --> 01:01:42.853
The coffee's still
warm though

01:01:42.886 --> 01:01:44.554
- if you wanna get some more.
- Yeah.

01:01:44.588 --> 01:01:46.490
- Here's your coffee.
- Yeah, not bad,

01:01:46.523 --> 01:01:49.226
not bad at all.

01:01:49.259 --> 01:01:50.594
<i>This house really
have two chimneys?</i>

01:01:50.627 --> 01:01:52.629
<i>Three.</i>

01:01:52.663 --> 01:01:54.498
<i>How big, look at that.</i>

01:02:47.517 --> 01:02:48.919
<i>Got you.</i>

01:03:10.774 --> 01:03:12.375
<i>Sure does.</i>

01:06:39.016 --> 01:06:40.917
<i>How's your sleep
last night?</i>

01:06:40.951 --> 01:06:43.553
- <i>Not too bad.</i>
- <i>Yeah. Pretty good.</i>

01:06:43.586 --> 01:06:45.488
- <i>You want a cigarette?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

01:06:45.522 --> 01:06:47.158
<i>Y'all take one too.</i>

01:06:47.191 --> 01:06:49.160
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:06:49.193 --> 01:06:51.628
<i>Shame the football team ain't
gonna be as good this year.</i>

01:06:51.661 --> 01:06:53.530
<i>Yeah.
I was thinking the same thing.</i>

01:06:53.563 --> 01:06:55.732
<i>Lost a lot of good players.</i>

01:07:00.670 --> 01:07:02.173
<i>Now, watch your shoes
over there.</i>

01:07:02.206 --> 01:07:04.175
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

01:07:08.945 --> 01:07:11.115
<i>Uh, I have a question
for you, Jim.</i>

01:07:11.148 --> 01:07:13.516
- <i>Uh-hmm.</i>
- <i>Um...</i>

01:07:14.651 --> 01:07:16.187
<i>Marjory's car is pulling
to the left.</i>

01:07:16.220 --> 01:07:17.787
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

01:07:17.821 --> 01:07:19.090
<i>You take
tire pressure first?</i>

01:07:19.123 --> 01:07:20.790
<i>Yeah, of course.
All right.</i>

01:07:20.824 --> 01:07:22.026
<i>But I just...
I know I need some line</i>

01:07:22.059 --> 01:07:23.294
- <i>but just not...</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

01:07:23.327 --> 01:07:24.894
<i>Who'd you...
who'd you go to?</i>

01:07:24.928 --> 01:07:26.230
<i>Would you do that
yourself?</i>

01:07:26.263 --> 01:07:27.797
<i>Yeah. It's not easy.</i>

01:07:27.831 --> 01:07:29.300
<i>He's got jacked up</i>

01:07:29.333 --> 01:07:31.235
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- <i>...go underneath.</i>

01:07:31.268 --> 01:07:33.703
<i>There's a... there's a bolt
straight.</i>

01:07:33.737 --> 01:07:35.538
<i>Get yourself
a measuring tape,</i>

01:07:35.572 --> 01:07:37.008
- <i>you got a lot of that, do you?</i>
- <i>Uh-hmm.</i>

01:07:37.041 --> 01:07:39.010
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:07:42.079 --> 01:07:44.848
<i>Oh, man,
sure do stinks</i>

01:07:44.881 --> 01:07:47.184
- <i>Sure does.</i>
- <i>That'll burn your eyes.</i>

01:07:47.218 --> 01:07:49.020
<i>Just watch
the wind direction.</i>

01:07:49.053 --> 01:07:50.920
<i>You suppose
that's the hair or the flesh.</i>

01:07:50.955 --> 01:07:52.323
<i>I'm just trying
not to think about it too,</i>

01:07:52.356 --> 01:07:53.890
<i>truth be told.</i>

01:07:53.923 --> 01:07:55.326
<i>It's a good combination.
All of it.</i>

01:07:55.359 --> 01:07:57.028
<i>Because I burn
my hair sometimes</i>

01:07:57.061 --> 01:07:59.230
- <i>and it stinks pretty awful.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

01:08:00.998 --> 01:08:02.699
<i>It's got that, uh,
barbeque sandwich a little bit.</i>

01:08:02.732 --> 01:08:04.235
<i>Yeah. You got like
a bandana or something</i>

01:08:04.268 --> 01:08:05.935
- <i>I can cover my nose with?</i>
- <i>No I don't.</i>

01:08:05.970 --> 01:08:07.704
<i>I've got handkerchief,
there you go.</i>

01:08:07.737 --> 01:08:08.872
- <i>Yeah. Thanks.</i>
- <i>It ain't clean,</i>

01:08:08.905 --> 01:08:10.074
<i>but you can use it.</i>

01:08:10.107 --> 01:08:11.708
<i>Cigarette too helps
a bit.</i>

01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:44.801
<i>We'll see here
what happens then.</i>

01:09:44.834 --> 01:09:46.403
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- <i>It turns out</i>

01:09:46.437 --> 01:09:48.272
<i>this robot thing has been
controlling everything.</i>

01:09:48.305 --> 01:09:49.939
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

01:09:49.974 --> 01:09:51.308
<i>And he's got this voice,
you know,</i>

01:09:51.341 --> 01:09:52.942
- <i>it's like, "Dave."</i>
- <i>Dave.</i>

01:09:52.977 --> 01:09:54.311
- <i>"Oh, Dave."</i>
- <i>All right.</i>

01:09:54.345 --> 01:09:56.013
<i>And it's like...
to talk to him, huh?</i>

01:09:56.046 --> 01:09:57.881
- <i>Yeah. And he's...
- and he's</i>

01:09:57.914 --> 01:09:59.350
<i>so he think he's a real person,
you know, after a while.</i>

01:09:59.383 --> 01:10:01.252
<i>Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.</i>

01:10:01.285 --> 01:10:02.919
<i>Thinks he's a real person
or he's actually thinking...</i>

01:10:02.952 --> 01:10:04.821
<i>Anyway, at the end,
he's an embryo.</i>

01:10:22.172 --> 01:10:27.172
