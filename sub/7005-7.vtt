00:07.939 --> 00:10.708
Welcome to a special
<i>tool time</i> on location.

00:10.709 --> 00:12.777
I am tim "the tool man" taylor.

00:12.778 --> 00:16.814
And you all know my assistant,
al "la carte" borland.

00:16.815 --> 00:18.749
We're here on location
to introduce to you

00:18.750 --> 00:21.586
Another one of our unsung heroes
of the job site.

00:21.587 --> 00:25.923
That's right.
Heidi, my unsung heroes
theme music, please.

00:25.924 --> 00:29.594
Heidi. Heidi!
Guys, back to work, please.

00:29.595 --> 00:31.496
Here you go, tim.

00:31.497 --> 00:34.465

and that ain't right

00:37.736 --> 00:41.373

00:41.374 --> 00:43.374
All right, now,

00:43.375 --> 00:46.845
Today we're gonna meet the man
who drives this great-looking
lunch wagon.

00:46.846 --> 00:50.415
Hi, there.
This is nick cantalupo.
The man, the melon.

00:50.416 --> 00:52.184
Thanks, tim. Uh...

00:52.185 --> 00:56.621
Your food service vehicle
doesn't get much respect
in the culinary community.

00:56.622 --> 01:00.225
People call it
the "roach coach,"
the "barf bus,"

01:00.226 --> 01:02.861
The "upchuck wagon,"
the "vomit van."

01:02.862 --> 01:05.630
Well, nick, you're really
whetting my appetite.

01:05.631 --> 01:09.834
Good. Because today
we're serving up
some really savory selections.

01:09.835 --> 01:13.338
Chili and onions,
chili cheese dogs,
three-cheese chili omelets.

01:13.339 --> 01:16.074
<i>(whistles)</i> I think I've died
and gone to heaven.

01:16.075 --> 01:18.677
I know what killed ya.

01:18.678 --> 01:22.580
Well, why don't you show us
inside the truck there?
Glad to, al.

01:22.581 --> 01:25.116
<i>(whistles)</i>
boy, nick!
This place is immaculate.

01:25.117 --> 01:29.821
Thank you, tim.
I take great pride
in my sanitary skills.

01:29.822 --> 01:32.824
Over here we have
your heated service trays.

01:32.825 --> 01:35.493
Now, this looks to be
some type of a cooling unit.

01:35.494 --> 01:39.564
Yes, al. In our business,
we refer to it
as a refrigerator.

01:39.565 --> 01:41.666
And over here, this is rosie,

01:41.667 --> 01:43.735
The fastest short-order cook
in the business.

01:43.736 --> 01:46.037
Hi, rosie.
Tim, you tell her
whatever you want,

01:46.038 --> 01:48.373
And you'll be eating
before you're done ordering it.

01:48.374 --> 01:50.609
Three stacks of pancakes,
eggs over-medium,

01:50.610 --> 01:53.645
Home fries smothered
in chili.

01:53.646 --> 01:57.448
<i>(mock-belches)</i>
boy, that was good. Very fast.

01:59.752 --> 02:01.520
Pretty fast, huh?

02:04.590 --> 02:07.158
She is fast.

02:10.596 --> 02:13.765
Hey!
Wow! She's speedy
with a spatula.

02:13.766 --> 02:16.067
Well, I don't want to brag,
but I think I'm speedier.

02:16.068 --> 02:19.571
Is he for real?
It's a question
I often ask myself.

02:19.572 --> 02:23.140
Hey, I worked my way
through college
as a short-order cook.

02:23.141 --> 02:25.510
You get pretty speedy
after eight-and-a-half years.

02:25.511 --> 02:27.745
Rosie, may I?

02:32.418 --> 02:35.786
A little more butter on there.
All right.

02:43.296 --> 02:47.065
Don't worry about these
eggshells, because basically,
it's roughage.

02:47.066 --> 02:50.034
To spice it up a little bit,
I like a little of this just...

02:50.035 --> 02:52.404
Ah, ok. There you go.

02:52.405 --> 02:57.542
Now, watch.
I learned this little trick
my senior year.

03:01.814 --> 03:04.516
Get some plates.
I'm all ready to go.
Ready to go. Whoa!

03:04.517 --> 03:06.818
I tell you what, nick -
you hold the plate.

03:06.819 --> 03:10.755
Look at that. Huh?

03:10.756 --> 03:12.791
Clean it up there.
As speedy as I remember.

03:12.792 --> 03:14.926
What do you think, nick?

03:17.663 --> 03:21.099
Maybe another year of college
would've helped my accuracy
a little bit.

03:21.100 --> 03:24.368
You know, you have
your choice of toast, nick.

04:15.954 --> 04:18.422
Hey! How're you doing?
Good to see you. Yeah.

04:18.423 --> 04:21.059
Hey, milton.
How's everything?
Great. Good to see you.

04:21.060 --> 04:23.394
Hey, guys.
Hello, mr. Harper, sir.

04:23.395 --> 04:25.096
Hey.
Hey, boss.

04:25.097 --> 04:28.900
Great show today
at that catering truck.
Thanks very much.

04:28.901 --> 04:31.769
Some of your funniest stuff,
tim. Yeah.

04:31.770 --> 04:33.771
What about me?

04:33.772 --> 04:35.607
You were in it, too?

04:35.608 --> 04:38.743
Yes. But if it pleases you,
I can be edited out.

04:38.744 --> 04:41.412
Relax, borland.
I'm just giving you a hard time.

04:41.413 --> 04:43.348
Where's your sense of humor?

04:43.349 --> 04:46.384
In a little town
called nowhere.

04:47.586 --> 04:49.688
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I think I'll go someplace

04:49.689 --> 04:52.190
Where I get a little bit
more respect.
Where's that, al?

04:52.191 --> 04:55.593
A little town called
anywhere but here.

04:57.363 --> 05:00.932
Uh, tim, you're a big pistons
fan, right?

05:00.933 --> 05:03.268
Oh, yeah. One of the all-time
great auto parts.

05:03.269 --> 05:05.270
<i>(grunts)</i>

05:05.271 --> 05:08.706
No. I'm talking
about the basketball team.
Mm-hmm.

05:08.707 --> 05:12.977
Yeah. How would you like
a couple of season tickets?

05:12.978 --> 05:16.080
You're gonna give me
season tickets?
Yes, I am...

05:16.081 --> 05:19.351
Right after you pay me
for them.
Huh?

05:19.352 --> 05:21.753
Yeah, you see,
this guy I know is selling me
his court-side seats

05:21.754 --> 05:25.056
So I thought I'd give
my favorite tool man
first crack at my old ones.

05:25.057 --> 05:28.226
Oh, boy. Season tickets.
That is just...

05:28.227 --> 05:31.396
Yeah, yeah.
Fifth row, center court.
Ooh!

05:31.397 --> 05:35.567
I mean, these seats
are so good, you can high-five
with the team mascot.

05:35.568 --> 05:36.801
What?
Yeah.

05:36.802 --> 05:39.970
Sir slam-a-lot!
That's right.

05:39.971 --> 05:42.473
Oh, this is a dream, man.
This is really a dream -

05:42.474 --> 05:44.609
Season tickets.
I'd better call jill.

05:44.610 --> 05:46.744
Oh, no. No, no.
No time for that. No.

05:46.745 --> 05:48.813
See, a vp at general motors
also wants them,

05:48.814 --> 05:51.316
And I'm meeting him for lunch
at about two o'clock.

05:51.317 --> 05:55.120
What time is it now?
1:59.

05:55.121 --> 05:57.188
Let me sleep on it. <i>(snores)</i>

05:57.189 --> 05:58.656
Ok.

06:01.527 --> 06:03.327
Hike. He's out.

06:03.328 --> 06:05.997
He throws to the quarterback.
Turns around. Yeah!

06:05.998 --> 06:07.765
Touchdown!
Touchdown.

06:07.766 --> 06:12.069
Hey, guys. You won't believe
what I bought today.

06:12.070 --> 06:13.704
Whoa! Pistons tickets.

06:13.705 --> 06:15.873
Not only pistons tickets -
season tickets.

06:15.874 --> 06:19.043
And they're all mine,
mine, mine, mine.

06:19.044 --> 06:21.078
Wah-wah-wah-wah.

06:23.315 --> 06:26.217
You know, dad,
I was just thinking

06:26.218 --> 06:30.889
That you and I really
don't get to spend enough
quality time together.

06:30.890 --> 06:34.859
I bet you figure
we could bond nicely
at the bulls/pistons game.

06:34.860 --> 06:37.929
I want to bond
at the orlando game.
No, no.

06:37.930 --> 06:40.698
I gave that ticket
to nick cantalupo.

06:40.699 --> 06:44.936
Who's he?
A very angry man.

06:44.937 --> 06:46.103
Is mom home?
Nope.

06:46.104 --> 06:48.105
She's with mark getting him
new glasses.

06:48.106 --> 06:50.107
I can't believe she let you
buy these season tickets.

06:50.108 --> 06:52.143
What do you mean, "let" me?

06:53.879 --> 06:56.114
You didn't tell mom?
No.

06:56.115 --> 06:58.416
I knew it was too good
to be true.

06:58.417 --> 07:01.352
Hold it, hold it.
There's nothing to worry about.

07:01.353 --> 07:03.521
Let me explain
how this marriage works.

07:03.522 --> 07:08.125
Your mom and I don't need
to talk over every decision,
you know.

07:08.126 --> 07:10.294
Why can't I get
contact lenses?

07:10.295 --> 07:12.296
I didn't say
that you couldn't.

07:12.297 --> 07:17.068
I said that we have to check
with your father first.

07:17.069 --> 07:19.770
That's how our marriage works.

07:19.771 --> 07:23.741
We don't make decisions
without checking
with each other. Hi.

07:23.742 --> 07:26.644
Well, unless the decision
had to be made
in under a minute, you know,

07:26.645 --> 07:29.547
'cause if both partners agree
on principal that there are...

07:29.548 --> 07:32.049
You know, autonomous decisions
are not bad thing between...

07:32.050 --> 07:35.286
It's not unusual for a partner
to make a decision without...

07:35.287 --> 07:38.288
It does happen in a marriage
that you can make those...

07:38.289 --> 07:39.857
It does... You can...

07:39.858 --> 07:41.892
<i>(clears throat)</i>

07:44.463 --> 07:47.365
Boys, will you excuse us
for a moment, please?

07:47.366 --> 07:50.201
Good luck, dad.
Think bonding.

07:52.938 --> 07:54.972
Ok, tim.

07:54.973 --> 07:57.975
What did you buy
and how little do we need it?

07:57.976 --> 07:59.610
It's no big deal.

07:59.611 --> 08:02.947
Bud offered me some pistons
tickets, so I bought them.

08:02.948 --> 08:06.651
How much were they?
$50 apiece.

08:06.652 --> 08:10.287
Well, that's not so bad.
No, it's not. Here we go.

08:12.090 --> 08:14.625
How many games?
All of them.

08:14.626 --> 08:16.827
What?

08:16.828 --> 08:20.064
All of them.

08:20.065 --> 08:21.832
How many games is that?

08:21.833 --> 08:24.602
Well, more than none
and less than 41.

08:26.738 --> 08:30.774
40 games at $50 apiece?
That's, like, $2,000!

08:30.775 --> 08:33.410
Per seat.
Per seat?

08:33.412 --> 08:35.346
How many seats did you buy?

08:35.347 --> 08:37.881
One... And the one next to it.

08:40.385 --> 08:44.222
Two seats!
That's... That's $4,000!

08:44.222 --> 08:45.956
Unless they get
in the play-offs,
'cause for some reason,

08:45.957 --> 08:49.727
Play-off tickets are
more money than regular seats.
More?

08:49.728 --> 08:53.097
It is ridiculous.
I'm gonna send them a letter.

08:53.098 --> 08:55.432
And send it from a new address!

08:57.635 --> 09:00.071
Let's not even worry
about the play-offs.
It's too far away.

09:00.072 --> 09:03.741
They'll never make it!
What am I talking about?
They're a lousy team this year.

09:03.742 --> 09:07.445
You spent $4,000
on a lousy team?

09:09.782 --> 09:12.116
Let me explain something
to you about basketball.
All right.

09:12.117 --> 09:15.653
You cannot get
season tickets like this
with a good team.

09:15.654 --> 09:20.291
You gotta ride out
the bad years,
hoping for a good one.

09:20.292 --> 09:22.694
That's what you said
17 years ago
when I married you,

09:22.695 --> 09:25.930
And I'm still waiting
for a good one.

09:27.365 --> 09:29.867
<i>(mock laughter)</i>

09:29.868 --> 09:32.537
I can't believe that
you made a decision like this

09:32.538 --> 09:34.505
Without discussing it
with me first.

09:34.506 --> 09:36.474
Well, bud needed an answer
right away.

09:36.475 --> 09:38.909
And you buy a lot of stuff
without asking me.

09:38.910 --> 09:40.644
Like what?

09:40.645 --> 09:42.947
This couch.

09:42.948 --> 09:46.250
How can you compare the two?
I bought the couch
because we need a place to sit!

09:46.251 --> 09:49.687
That's why I bought the tickets.
I want to go to the game.
I need a place to sit.

09:52.457 --> 09:54.892
This money is supposed
to be for education.

09:54.893 --> 09:57.495
For my graduate school,
the kids' college funds...

09:57.496 --> 10:00.331
I'm not gonna dip into
the college fund. We'll get
the money someplace else.

10:00.332 --> 10:03.067
Where?
Well, you know, I wouldn't...

10:03.068 --> 10:06.337
I wouldn't mind giving up
that vacation we had planned.

10:06.338 --> 10:08.873
Oh, that's big of you.
You didn't care about going
to new york anyway.

10:08.874 --> 10:12.644
We don't have to now,
'cause the new york knicks
are coming to town.

10:12.645 --> 10:14.979
And the washington bullets,
the boston celtics -

10:14.980 --> 10:18.916
The entire eastern seaboard'll
be right here in motor city!

10:21.653 --> 10:24.221
Don't look at me like that.

10:24.222 --> 10:28.092
Then put the money back
in the bank account.

10:28.093 --> 10:30.862
Did I explain that,
from where these seats are,

10:30.863 --> 10:33.698
You can actually reach out
and touch the mascot, sir...
<i>(door slams)</i>

10:33.699 --> 10:35.700
...Slam-a-lot?

10:41.340 --> 10:44.408
Hey, guys.
Hey. How're you doing, harry?

10:44.409 --> 10:48.379
Oh, what a surprise.
Benny's still here.
Hey, al.

10:48.380 --> 10:51.482
So, did you take
your mother-in-law
to get her bunions removed?

10:51.483 --> 10:53.617
Yeah. But I'd rather
have kept the bunions

10:53.618 --> 10:56.788
And had my mother-in-law
removed.

10:56.789 --> 10:58.289
Hey, harry.

10:58.290 --> 11:00.892
You hear tim picked up
season tickets to the pistons?

11:00.893 --> 11:02.694
I just hope it doesn't
go to his head.

11:02.695 --> 11:05.496
A guy gets season tickets,
it could affect
his whole demeanor.

11:05.497 --> 11:07.732
Nah. Tim isn't like that.

11:07.733 --> 11:10.434
Yeah.
Besides, people only change

11:10.435 --> 11:13.604
If you treat them different.
And we're not gonna do that.

11:14.973 --> 11:17.008
Hey, guys.
Hey!

11:17.009 --> 11:19.377
Hey! Good to see you, man!
Hey!

11:19.378 --> 11:22.046
Get him a cup of coffee
and a bear claw.

11:22.047 --> 11:24.282
He takes sugar
in that coffee.
My pleasure.

11:24.283 --> 11:28.552
It would be an honor
to serve my best friend.

11:28.553 --> 11:31.756
Does me being your best friend
have anything to do with
having season tickets?

11:31.757 --> 11:35.692
The two things
are not unrelated.

11:35.693 --> 11:37.728
Hey, well, look,
he's taking me
to the game first

11:37.729 --> 11:39.630
Because I'm his hardware guy.

11:39.631 --> 11:42.567
No. If anyone deserves to go,
it's me. I'm his brother.

11:42.568 --> 11:45.102
Excuse me. I'm the one that
risks his life every day

11:45.103 --> 11:47.304
Working next to him.

11:49.074 --> 11:51.541
Uh, the man's got a point.
All right, ok.

11:51.542 --> 11:53.678
But I'm next after al.

11:53.679 --> 11:57.381
Well, maybe none of you
are going, because maybe
I'm not keeping the tickets.

11:59.284 --> 12:02.085
Why would you give up
season tickets?

12:02.086 --> 12:05.022
When I went home
and told jill I bought them,
she got mad and...

12:05.023 --> 12:06.824
She gave me the look.
Ooh.

12:06.825 --> 12:08.860
Not the look.
What's the look?

12:08.861 --> 12:12.563
Oh, come on.
It's just the most potent
weapon in a woman's arsenal.

12:12.564 --> 12:15.666
Her face will transform
right in front of you.

12:15.667 --> 12:19.837
Her lips get really tight
like this.

12:19.838 --> 12:22.739
Yeah. And then her whole face
shrivels up. It's like...

12:24.109 --> 12:26.677
Yeah. And then her eyes
get real small

12:26.678 --> 12:30.982
And meet right in the middle
of her head like a cyclops
in a housecoat.

12:32.951 --> 12:35.019
Just when you think
you can't take anymore,

12:35.020 --> 12:38.256
She lines you up
and finishes you off.

12:39.825 --> 12:41.559
Ohh!

12:41.560 --> 12:43.561
I'm never getting married.

12:43.562 --> 12:47.532
And not just because
women can't stand me.

12:47.533 --> 12:50.167
I hate the look.

12:50.168 --> 12:54.004
What do you know about the look?
You're not even married.

12:54.005 --> 12:56.941
I get the look
when I'm snippy to mother.

13:05.083 --> 13:08.752
But in your mom's case,
the look's actually
an improvement.

13:10.121 --> 13:12.190
Hey, tim, you have
to keep the tickets.

13:12.191 --> 13:15.526
You know, I don't think I can.
No, I don't know
if this is gonna be worth it.

13:15.527 --> 13:18.262
Every time I go
to a pistons game,
I'm gonna get the look.

13:18.263 --> 13:20.864
Yeah. And what about the look
you're gonna get
when you come home?

13:20.865 --> 13:23.367
<i>(shudders)</i>

13:23.368 --> 13:26.970
That's two looks per game.

13:26.971 --> 13:30.374
Times 40 games,
that's 80 looks.

13:30.375 --> 13:34.512
And that doesn't count
the looks I get for just
doing normal bad things.

13:34.513 --> 13:36.546
Yeah. But you gotta stand
your ground, tim.

13:36.547 --> 13:38.749
You can't let your wife
intimidate you.

13:38.750 --> 13:40.151
Harry!
Dolores!

13:40.152 --> 13:42.819
Uh, what are you doing here?

13:42.820 --> 13:44.821
You want to know
what I'm doing here?

13:44.822 --> 13:46.823
I'll tell you
what I'm doing here.

13:46.824 --> 13:50.127
You all remember
my lovely wife, dolores.

13:50.128 --> 13:53.697
Hi. Nice seeing you.
How are you?

13:53.698 --> 13:55.999
How could you drop my mother off
at the podiatrist

13:56.000 --> 13:57.634
And just leave her there?

13:57.635 --> 13:59.970
I gave her bus fare.

13:59.971 --> 14:02.373
She just called.
She can't even get her shoes on.

14:02.374 --> 14:05.409
Go back and pick her up.
Why can't you do it?

14:05.410 --> 14:08.379
I'm in the middle of a shift.
Well, I'm working too.

14:08.380 --> 14:12.082
Yeah, right. Looks like
you're killing yourself.

14:12.083 --> 14:15.185
Harry, I'm telling you
to go get her.

14:18.222 --> 14:20.825
I'm telling you no.

14:20.826 --> 14:23.327
Look out, guys.
Here it comes.

14:48.854 --> 14:50.721
Oh, my god!

14:54.626 --> 14:57.795
I've never seen anything
like it.

14:57.796 --> 15:03.000
Where's the podiatrist?
I'll go get her myself.

15:03.001 --> 15:05.937
Listen, I'll drive you there.

15:05.938 --> 15:08.172
I'll show you the way!

15:14.445 --> 15:18.515
Thank goodness we shut our eyes
at the right time, marty.

15:18.516 --> 15:20.718
Man, they're dropping
like flies.

15:20.719 --> 15:23.988
Hey, tim.
You gotta stand up to jill.

15:23.989 --> 15:26.023
Oh.
No, no.

15:26.024 --> 15:29.793
'cause every time one of us
gets beaten down by the look...

15:29.794 --> 15:33.064
...A little piece
of every man dies.

15:33.065 --> 15:36.600
And I think we all know
what that piece is.

15:44.977 --> 15:49.313
My contact lens has to be
around here somewhere.

15:49.314 --> 15:50.681
Way to go, mark.

15:50.682 --> 15:52.749
The contact has spent
more time on the floor

15:52.750 --> 15:55.486
Than it has in your eyes.

15:55.487 --> 15:57.521
Anybody home?

15:57.522 --> 15:58.923
Hey, guys.
Hey, dad.

15:58.924 --> 16:00.891
<i>(brad)</i> hey, dad.
Well...

16:00.892 --> 16:04.395
I don't care what you're
playing, but I'm in.

16:06.364 --> 16:09.099
It's called
"looking for mark's contact."

16:09.100 --> 16:11.101
How do you play?

16:12.871 --> 16:15.706
You look for mark's contact.

16:15.707 --> 16:18.008
Ok. Whose turn?

16:19.511 --> 16:23.179
Ok, dad. It's yours.
Ok, one, two, three... Go!

16:26.284 --> 16:28.351
<i>(brad chuckles)</i>

16:32.023 --> 16:34.792
Wait, I found it!

16:34.793 --> 16:37.995
It was in my eye the whole time.

16:37.996 --> 16:40.831
Well, if you're gonna cheat...

16:44.402 --> 16:46.770
So, dad, what's happening
with the basketball tickets?

16:46.771 --> 16:49.306
Yeah, have you caved in?
I'm not giving up
the tickets.

16:49.307 --> 16:52.877
'cause if I do, a little piece
of every man dies.

16:52.878 --> 16:55.145
Which piece?

16:56.581 --> 16:59.183
You just never mind.

16:59.184 --> 17:01.619
Tim, we need to talk.
Boys?

17:01.620 --> 17:03.821
We know, we know.

17:06.558 --> 17:08.023
Ok.

17:08.025 --> 17:10.026
I was thinking about
this thing with the tickets,

17:10.027 --> 17:12.162
And maybe I was
a little unfair.

17:12.163 --> 17:15.265
Really?
I know how important
they are to you.

17:15.266 --> 17:18.635
So I think I've come up
with a really good compromise.

17:18.636 --> 17:22.372
How about you keep the tickets
for five games,

17:22.373 --> 17:24.040
And you sell off the rest?

17:24.040 --> 17:26.143
Five out of 40?
You call that a compromise?

17:26.144 --> 17:28.479
That's $500.
I think that's fair.

17:28.480 --> 17:31.414
Maybe you don't understand
the concept here, honey.
These are season tickets,

17:31.415 --> 17:35.186
Not whenever-your-wife-
wants-you-to-go tickets.

17:35.187 --> 17:37.288
So what are you saying?
You're not willing
to budge at all?

17:37.289 --> 17:39.356
If I give up my season tickets
because of my wife,

17:39.357 --> 17:41.091
Other wives are gonna
pick up on this.

17:41.092 --> 17:44.228
Pretty soon, wives everywhere
are gonna be going, "you know,

17:44.229 --> 17:48.798
The tool man gave up
his season tickets.
You should too."

17:50.001 --> 17:52.203
Attendance starts dropping
at stadiums.

17:52.204 --> 17:53.537
Next thing we know,

17:53.538 --> 17:56.841
It's the end of professional
sports worldwide.

17:56.842 --> 18:00.844
You are just completely
unwilling to compromise!

18:00.845 --> 18:05.149
Yeah. I don't even know
the meaning of the word
"compromise."

18:05.150 --> 18:08.719
You don't know the meaning
to a lot of words.

18:10.321 --> 18:12.923
And don't you forget it.

18:31.343 --> 18:34.578
Hey, wilson.
Well, hi-dee-ho, neighbor.

18:34.579 --> 18:37.581
What are you doing?
I'm barbecuing some jerk.

18:39.217 --> 18:41.886
Anybody I know?

18:41.887 --> 18:43.854
Actually, jerk is
a very spicy dish

18:43.855 --> 18:45.889
Native to the island
of jamaica.

18:45.890 --> 18:47.758
You know, I'm thinking
of going down there

18:47.759 --> 18:49.727
And doing a little
bamboo rafting.

18:49.728 --> 18:53.397
Well, you got it made.
Unattached guy like you...

18:53.398 --> 18:56.567
You don't need permission
to go to 40 pistons games.

18:56.568 --> 18:58.569
Uh-oh.

19:00.371 --> 19:03.707
I take it jill was not
too thrilled
with your recent purchase.

19:03.708 --> 19:10.447
That's putting it mildly.
First, she gave me the look.

19:10.448 --> 19:13.217
The look!

19:13.218 --> 19:18.021
You know about the look?
Oh, tim, every man knows
about the look.

19:18.022 --> 19:21.458
Wives have been giving
their husbands the look
for untold centuries.

19:21.459 --> 19:24.761
As a matter of fact,
the look was the reason that
brides started wearing veils.

19:24.762 --> 19:28.332
It was long believed
that the penetrating stare
of a bride

19:28.333 --> 19:32.436
Could weaken her husband
and render him impotent.

19:34.472 --> 19:39.243
I thought that was caused
by all the brown liquor
at the reception.

19:39.244 --> 19:41.445
Well, that could do it too, tim.

19:41.446 --> 19:44.414
I gotta be honest with you.
Jill's look did weaken me.

19:44.415 --> 19:45.983
It did.

19:45.984 --> 19:48.451
But I didn't break.
Ah.

19:48.452 --> 19:52.322
Then she brought out
the sneakiest, most underhanded
trick in the book.

19:52.323 --> 19:55.058
What was that?
Compromise.

19:55.059 --> 19:57.060
Ah!

19:57.061 --> 19:59.863
The old ploy
where both sides decide
to be reasonable.

19:59.864 --> 20:03.500
Reasonable? Five games
out of 40 is reasonable?
I don't think--

20:03.501 --> 20:06.336
What was your counteroffer?
I don't think
that applies here.

20:06.337 --> 20:09.206
Because you didn't make one.
No, I did not.

20:09.207 --> 20:12.375
You know, tim, I'm reminded
of an old philosopher
who once said:

20:12.376 --> 20:15.112
"you have to give a little,
take a little..

20:15.113 --> 20:17.814
"let your poor heart
break a little."

20:20.451 --> 20:22.486
♪ that's the story of

20:22.487 --> 20:25.856
♪ that's the glory of love ♪

20:25.857 --> 20:28.225
All right, nick.
You got atlanta on the second.

20:28.226 --> 20:32.095
Got it.
I want seattle
on the 15th of November.

20:32.096 --> 20:33.697
All right, al.
You got it, buddy.

20:33.698 --> 20:36.000
Ok. But I want the bulls
on January 21st.

20:36.001 --> 20:38.335
January 21st
is our anniversary.

20:38.336 --> 20:42.339
Well, guess where we're going.

20:42.340 --> 20:44.007
Over my dead body.

20:44.008 --> 20:48.279
Well, at least for once
it'll be nice and quiet
in the car.

20:48.280 --> 20:52.115
Dolores, I'll take the bulls.
I'll go with you.

20:52.116 --> 20:55.185
If you got the bulls,
I'm taking houston.
I'll go with you.

20:55.186 --> 20:58.255
I want phoenix.
I'll go with you.

20:58.256 --> 21:00.024
I don't even know you.

21:00.025 --> 21:03.092
Who really knows anybody?

21:04.629 --> 21:07.764
Well, hi, everyone.
Hi, honey. Um...

21:07.765 --> 21:09.600
Watch the board
for a minute.
Sure.

21:09.601 --> 21:13.002
What's going on?
Um...

21:13.003 --> 21:15.271
I decided to compromise.

21:15.272 --> 21:17.340
You did?

21:17.341 --> 21:20.677
You gotta give a little,
take a little...

21:20.678 --> 21:24.615
Uh...
Want me to sing it?

21:24.616 --> 21:26.649
Not really.

21:26.650 --> 21:29.720
But I would like to hear
some more about this compromise.

21:29.721 --> 21:30.854
Ok.

21:30.855 --> 21:33.323
I wanted all 40.
You wanted five.

21:33.324 --> 21:36.059
What do you say
we settle on 15?

21:36.060 --> 21:38.862
Fifteen's still
a lot of money.

21:38.863 --> 21:41.365
Let's settle on ten.
How about eight?

21:41.366 --> 21:43.166
Ten.
How about none?

21:43.167 --> 21:45.602
Eight's good.

21:45.603 --> 21:46.937
Ok.

21:46.938 --> 21:50.173
Tim, could we see you
for a second here?
Yeah?

21:50.174 --> 21:52.042
Harry's got
an interesting point.

21:52.043 --> 21:54.378
What if by some chance
the pistons get
into the play-offs?

21:54.379 --> 21:56.213
How do we divvy up
those tickets?

21:56.214 --> 21:58.782
The play-offs are gonna cost
more money anyway, right?

21:58.783 --> 22:02.186
I already got my eight tickets.
You guys fight over 'em.

22:02.187 --> 22:03.754
You're giving up
play-off tickets?

22:03.755 --> 22:08.325
Yes, marty. Because I know
"the glory of love."

22:08.326 --> 22:10.361
Want me to sing it?

22:10.362 --> 22:13.964
No, thank you.

22:13.965 --> 22:17.735
If the pistons make
the play-offs,
can I buy some games?

22:17.736 --> 22:19.970
What do you want
with play-off games, honey?

22:19.971 --> 22:22.005
I'm gonna take my husband.

22:22.006 --> 22:26.377
Hey. Your husband's
a very lucky man.

22:26.378 --> 22:30.147
How come you never say
anything nice like that to me?

22:30.148 --> 22:33.183
Your husband isn't as lucky.

22:39.857 --> 22:42.091
I want the knicks
on February 21st.

22:42.092 --> 22:43.827
Oh, I hate the knicks.

22:43.828 --> 22:46.797
I'll go with you.

22:46.798 --> 22:49.900
Oh, sorry, dolores.
That's one of my eight.

22:49.901 --> 22:52.603
I'm from new york,
and I want the knicks.

22:52.604 --> 22:54.137
Well, twiddle-dee-dee.
I'm from detroit,

22:54.138 --> 22:55.973
And I like the knicks.
I'm not selling them.

22:55.974 --> 22:58.041
Oh, really?

23:07.452 --> 23:10.987
She is good. Really good.

23:13.357 --> 23:15.959
I'm telling you no!

23:15.960 --> 23:18.494
Look out, guys. Here it comes.
