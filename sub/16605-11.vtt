00:00.133 --> 00:02.835
♪♪

00:08.875 --> 00:12.111
So, do we finally
get to find out what
this mission is about?

00:12.113 --> 00:14.446
Hera already told you.
It's secret.

00:14.448 --> 00:15.781
Isn't that everything we do?

00:15.783 --> 00:17.616
Some things
more than others.

00:17.618 --> 00:19.418
Okay, Chop,
put Command through.

00:21.388 --> 00:22.955
Senator Organa?

00:22.957 --> 00:25.724
<i>I wanted to explain</i>
<i>the mission personally,</i>
<i>Captain Syndulla.</i>

00:25.726 --> 00:27.192
<i>There is much at stake.</i>

00:27.194 --> 00:29.895
How can we help?
<i>Rebel Command received</i>
<i>your report</i>

00:29.897 --> 00:32.564
<i>on the apparent disappearance</i>
<i>of the Geonosian people.</i>

00:32.566 --> 00:36.068
<i>After some debate,</i>
<i>we decided to take a risk</i>
<i>and investigate.</i>

00:36.070 --> 00:38.137
So we're looking
for Geonosians?

00:38.139 --> 00:41.740
<i>No. You are looking for</i>
<i>the team we already sent.</i>

00:41.742 --> 00:43.709
<i>We lost contact with them</i>
<i>two cycles ago.</i>

00:43.711 --> 00:47.012
Do you think
it was the Empire?
<i>Unknown.</i>

00:47.014 --> 00:50.149
<i>Contact was lost after</i>
<i>the team reported</i>
<i>an energy source</i>

00:50.151 --> 00:51.717
<i>on the planet's surface.</i>

00:51.719 --> 00:53.085
Energy source?

00:53.087 --> 00:55.421
When we went to Geonosis,
there was nothing.

00:55.423 --> 00:57.489
No signs of life
or power.

00:57.491 --> 01:01.927
<i>Your primary mission is</i>
<i>to recover our people</i>
<i>and any intel they gathered.</i>

01:01.929 --> 01:03.829
Who is it we're
looking for?

01:03.831 --> 01:05.664
Saw Gerrera.

01:07.033 --> 01:09.435
Rex, you knew about this?

01:10.070 --> 01:11.703
Yeah, I did.

01:11.705 --> 01:13.705
I've known Saw
a long time,

01:13.707 --> 01:16.108
and I've learned
when he's concerned
about something,

01:16.110 --> 01:19.278
it's usually worth
taking a closer look.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.947
So, Saw is worried about
what we found?

01:21.949 --> 01:24.783
He's worried about
what we didn't find.

01:36.196 --> 01:39.264
The construction modules
and debris we saw last time,

01:39.933 --> 01:42.201
it's all gone.

01:42.203 --> 01:44.570
Well, I'm picking up
a power source
on the surface

01:44.572 --> 01:46.038
right where Command
said it would be,

01:46.040 --> 01:49.241
but I can't raise Saw
on any channel.
There's only static.

01:49.243 --> 01:51.543
Geonosians live underground.

01:51.545 --> 01:53.812
It's possible Saw
and his people can't
hear our transmission.

01:53.814 --> 01:56.215
Let's get down there
and find out.

02:08.228 --> 02:11.930
Hang on. This storm is
wreaking havoc on my scopes.

02:11.932 --> 02:14.233
Chopper, stabilizers!

02:19.005 --> 02:21.173
How's it feel
to be back, Rex?

02:21.175 --> 02:23.408
(SCOFFS) Honestly?

02:23.410 --> 02:26.245
I was hoping I'd never
have to come back
to this dust ball.

02:38.358 --> 02:41.126
I had to set her down,
but we're in the neighborhood.

02:41.128 --> 02:44.196
According to Command,
Gerrera's recon team
entered a structure

02:44.198 --> 02:46.965
two klicks north
of our current position.

02:46.967 --> 02:48.767
Maybe they took
shelter there.

02:48.769 --> 02:50.102
It's possible.

02:50.104 --> 02:52.037
Sabine, what about
the power source you detected?

02:52.839 --> 02:54.873
Different location,
and close.

02:54.875 --> 02:56.141
But thanks to the storm,

02:56.143 --> 02:58.710
I can't get a precise reading
about where or what it is.

03:00.046 --> 03:01.713
Keep working on it.

03:01.715 --> 03:03.448
Until we know more
about that power source,

03:03.450 --> 03:05.617
we'll split up
into two groups.

03:05.619 --> 03:07.452
Rex, Kanan,
Ezra and Chopper,

03:07.454 --> 03:09.821
go check out the coordinates
of Saw's last transmission.

03:09.823 --> 03:11.356
What about me?

03:11.358 --> 03:12.791
You're staying here
with us,

03:12.793 --> 03:14.459
in case the Empire
comes along.

03:14.461 --> 03:17.296
(CHUCKLES)
So I can bust some buckets.

03:23.703 --> 03:26.805
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)

03:26.807 --> 03:28.774
EZRA: Well, I can't see
anything either.

03:35.481 --> 03:36.882
There's a temple up ahead

03:36.884 --> 03:39.618
and probably an entrance
to the underground passages.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.695
REX: Saw? Saw Gerrera?

03:49.697 --> 03:52.030
EZRA: Anyone here? Saw?

03:52.032 --> 03:55.500
REX: Spread out and see
if you can find the entrance
to the underground.

03:57.370 --> 03:59.204
I can't believe it.

03:59.206 --> 04:00.906
Did the bugs build this?

04:00.908 --> 04:04.776
REX: Oh, yes.
They're more clever than
you would think, and creative.

04:04.778 --> 04:07.012
That doesn't mean
they aren't dangerous as well.

04:07.014 --> 04:09.915
So, Rex, how do you know
Saw Gerrera?

04:09.917 --> 04:11.683
Oh, we go way back.

04:14.053 --> 04:17.689
I trained him
and his sister, Steela,
during the Clone War.

04:17.691 --> 04:19.958
They were part of a plan
to help localized militias

04:19.960 --> 04:22.361
fight for themselves
against the Separatists.

04:22.363 --> 04:24.630
She didn't make it.

04:24.632 --> 04:26.431
But he carried on

04:26.433 --> 04:29.067
and even started
his own rebel cell
after the Empire took over.

04:29.069 --> 04:31.169
Hey, I think
I found something.

04:33.740 --> 04:36.708
Looks like some
kind of passage down there.

04:36.710 --> 04:39.378
This is the entrance
to the tunnels.

04:39.380 --> 04:41.380
Looks like
it was deliberately sealed.

04:41.382 --> 04:43.048
Well, not sealed enough.

04:43.050 --> 04:45.450
This must be
where Saw's team went in.

04:49.155 --> 04:50.989
(GRUNTING)

04:50.991 --> 04:53.892
Chopper's still not
picking up signals
of any kind.

04:53.894 --> 04:55.193
Let's go take a look.

05:12.845 --> 05:15.681
So what do they look like?
The Geonosians?

05:15.683 --> 05:19.851
REX: Well, they kind of look
like battle droids,
to tell you the truth.

05:19.853 --> 05:21.987
Ugly battle droids
that smell.

05:28.194 --> 05:31.396
Hmm. Looks like
all these side passages
have been blocked off.

05:33.032 --> 05:37.169
REX: Yeah. Deliberately.
Just like above.

05:37.171 --> 05:38.937
Why would they do that?

05:42.041 --> 05:43.942
The air is still
down here.

05:43.944 --> 05:46.545
The sealed passages
must be blocking the airflow.

05:46.547 --> 05:49.381
Certainly limits our options
for going forward.

05:54.187 --> 05:55.620
Here!

05:59.525 --> 06:00.959
I found a helmet.

06:03.062 --> 06:06.898
I know this marking.
It's from Saw's team.

06:08.868 --> 06:11.536
(GRUNTING)

06:11.538 --> 06:15.941
There's another.
Oh, and more down there.

06:19.979 --> 06:22.381
All from Saw's unit.

06:22.383 --> 06:24.750
But where are
the people?

06:24.752 --> 06:27.452
They must've
been attacked.
By who?

06:30.256 --> 06:32.424
(FAINT CHITTERING)

06:35.928 --> 06:37.095
There's something up ahead.

06:40.066 --> 06:41.633
(CHITTERING CONTINUES)

06:45.671 --> 06:47.105
It's moving away.

06:47.107 --> 06:48.907
What is it?

06:50.209 --> 06:53.011
It's gone.
We should go too.

06:53.013 --> 06:55.747
Go?
Kanan, why?

06:55.749 --> 06:57.749
We have to find
Saw's rebels.

06:57.751 --> 07:01.953
Ezra, all we found
are sealed up tunnels
and some rebel gear.

07:01.955 --> 07:03.221
There's something working
against us.

07:03.223 --> 07:05.056
I'm not sure what,

07:05.058 --> 07:07.893
but we're out of our element
and away from our team.

07:07.895 --> 07:10.595
We'll just call for backup.
Chop, get Hera.

07:10.597 --> 07:12.798
(SCANNING)

07:12.800 --> 07:14.366
(GRUNTING)

07:14.368 --> 07:17.102
(SIGHS) We must be too deep.
The signal can't reach her.

07:17.104 --> 07:19.905
Someone's down here,
and I bet they know
what happened.

07:19.907 --> 07:21.106
I say we go on.

07:21.108 --> 07:23.108
Rex, it's up to you
to break the tie.

07:23.110 --> 07:25.944
(GRUNTING)
Nope, you don't get a vote.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.913
(GRUNTING FRUSTRATEDLY)

07:27.915 --> 07:32.317
Well, if you want my opinion,
I say we press on.

07:32.319 --> 07:33.952
I know Saw would do
the same for me.

07:33.954 --> 07:36.121
Okay, we'll keep going.

07:36.123 --> 07:37.889
But there's times
I hate being right,

07:37.891 --> 07:39.491
and I hope this isn't
one of 'em.

07:45.298 --> 07:47.966
(FAINT CHITTERING)

08:03.349 --> 08:06.084
I don't understand.
Where did the rebels go?

08:06.086 --> 08:07.919
It's just a dead end.

08:07.921 --> 08:10.255
KANAN: (GROANS)
Do you have to call it that?

08:10.257 --> 08:14.159
(DISTANT CLATTERING)

08:14.161 --> 08:15.994
EZRA: Look!
Are those Geonosians?

08:15.996 --> 08:18.864
Not Geonosians.
Clankers.

08:18.866 --> 08:21.933
Halt.
You will be eliminated.

08:21.935 --> 08:23.768
Battle droids.

08:23.770 --> 08:25.203
We can do this.

08:26.806 --> 08:28.707
Oh. Uh...

08:30.109 --> 08:32.010
Blast 'em!

08:32.012 --> 08:33.778
Okay, we can
probably do this.

08:33.780 --> 08:35.113
Nice.

08:39.886 --> 08:41.920
Jedi! Open fire!

08:53.299 --> 08:54.533
(YELPS)

08:57.403 --> 08:59.604
What was that?
It wasn't the droids.

09:00.339 --> 09:01.907
We've been outflanked!

09:14.153 --> 09:15.220
(METAL CLATTERING)

09:25.231 --> 09:26.565
Saw.

09:31.771 --> 09:33.238
Captain Rex.

09:33.240 --> 09:36.207
So, you decided to come
to Geonosis after all.

09:36.209 --> 09:38.710
Yeah. To rescue you.

09:38.712 --> 09:41.346
Is that what's happening?
(CHUCKLES)

09:46.786 --> 09:48.687
It's good to see you alive,
my old friend.

09:48.689 --> 09:50.388
I want you to meet
Kanan and Ezra.

09:50.390 --> 09:53.625
(GRUNTING)

09:53.627 --> 09:55.493
Oh, right, and Chopper.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.797
So, you're Jedi.

09:58.799 --> 10:00.198
We do our best.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.100
Never thought I'd meet
another Jedi,

10:02.635 --> 10:03.768
much less two.

10:03.770 --> 10:06.304
The galaxy is
full of surprises.

10:06.306 --> 10:09.207
Including what's happening
here on Geonosis.

10:09.209 --> 10:10.642
You've found something?

10:19.318 --> 10:21.219
How's it going out there?

10:21.221 --> 10:24.789
SABINE: (GROANS)
This storm is gonna
seriously damage my paint job.

10:24.791 --> 10:27.225
I meant with the mission.

10:27.227 --> 10:31.062
We're closing in
on the power source.
It's just up ahead.

10:31.064 --> 10:32.897
ZEB: Whatever it is,
it's big.

10:33.733 --> 10:36.701
How do you know that?
Look.

10:39.805 --> 10:41.673
SABINE:
Oh, I don't believe it.

10:41.675 --> 10:43.475
Spectre-5, what do you see?

10:43.477 --> 10:45.810
Hera, it's a shield generator.

10:45.812 --> 10:47.579
I didn't copy, Spectre-5.

10:47.581 --> 10:49.314
Did you say
"shield generator"?

10:49.316 --> 10:50.915
SABINE: <i> Oh, yeah.</i>
<i>Military grade.</i>

10:53.419 --> 10:55.854
Looks like
it's fully operational.

10:55.856 --> 10:58.456
This is what's responsible
for those power readings.

10:58.458 --> 11:00.425
HERA: <i> Can you extract</i>
<i>the deflector core?</i>

11:00.427 --> 11:03.928
Well, it won't be easy
in this storm,
but we can do it.

11:03.930 --> 11:05.930
Luck's on our side
for a change.

11:05.932 --> 11:08.199
Chopper Base
could really use a shield.

11:08.201 --> 11:10.268
Get to work.
I'll contact Kanan.

11:10.270 --> 11:13.138
(BEEPS) <i>Ghost</i> to Spectre-1.
Do you read me?

11:13.140 --> 11:14.339
(STATIC)
(GROANS)

11:16.709 --> 11:18.376
Spectre-1, come in.

11:20.279 --> 11:23.181
So this shield,
what do you think
it was protecting?

11:23.183 --> 11:24.215
What do you mean?

11:24.217 --> 11:26.551
(BEEPING)

11:26.553 --> 11:29.454
You don't just find
a fully operational
shield generator

11:29.456 --> 11:31.890
on a deserted planet
for no reason.

11:31.892 --> 11:34.626
Good point.
You know what that means?

11:34.628 --> 11:36.828
Um, no. What does that mean?

11:36.830 --> 11:38.263
Work fast!

11:41.333 --> 11:43.234
A shield generator?

11:43.236 --> 11:44.903
Separatist model.

11:44.905 --> 11:46.404
About as old as you, Rex.

11:46.406 --> 11:47.972
But someone's
kept it operational,

11:47.974 --> 11:49.240
been maintaining it.

11:49.242 --> 11:50.809
Battle droids?

11:50.811 --> 11:52.343
(CHUCKLES)
These old clankers?

11:52.345 --> 11:53.411
Not a chance.

11:53.413 --> 11:55.380
Technology's too
sophisticated.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.482
Besides, by the look of 'em,

11:57.484 --> 11:59.584
someone's been
repairing them too.

11:59.586 --> 12:01.920
Well, we were following
something.

12:01.922 --> 12:03.888
That's how we wound up
in this trap.

12:04.490 --> 12:06.858
It was a bug. Had to be.

12:06.860 --> 12:09.761
He got my unit
using the same tactics.

12:09.763 --> 12:11.596
I was the only survivor.

12:11.598 --> 12:14.866
Yeah, the more I hear,
the more I don't like this.

12:14.868 --> 12:16.668
We should go back
and report to Hera.

12:16.670 --> 12:18.937
Back? No. Wait.

12:18.939 --> 12:22.707
You can't. That bug is
the key to finding out
what's going on here.

12:22.709 --> 12:24.609
Don't you understand
what's at stake?

12:24.611 --> 12:28.279
We know the Empire wiped out
the entire population
of this planet.

12:29.048 --> 12:30.915
We need to find out why.

12:30.917 --> 12:32.784
The Empire is
hiding something,
something important,

12:32.786 --> 12:36.020
and that bug
knows what it is.

12:37.723 --> 12:40.425
He's right.
I say we help Saw.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.360
Hmm. I second that.

12:42.362 --> 12:44.729
Okay. We can stay
and search for the bug,

12:44.731 --> 12:47.699
but we have to warn Hera
about the droids first.

12:47.701 --> 12:50.201
I can help you with that.
This way.

12:57.877 --> 13:00.879
I've been able to
map a fair amount
of these tunnels.

13:00.881 --> 13:02.113
There's a breeze.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.249
Whoa. Watch your step,
Master Jedi.

13:04.251 --> 13:06.951
(CHUCKLING)
It's a long way down.

13:18.264 --> 13:19.731
EZRA: Whoa.

13:19.733 --> 13:22.300
I tracked the bug
to this shaft.

13:22.302 --> 13:25.336
But it severed the bridge,
so I've never been able
to get across.

13:25.338 --> 13:27.472
How far down does it go?

13:28.274 --> 13:30.408
Down, I don't know.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.377
But it goes all the way up
to the surface.

13:33.412 --> 13:36.181
That's why
you feel the air, so...

13:36.183 --> 13:38.583
We can contact our ship.
Exactly.

13:41.253 --> 13:43.288
KANAN: <i> Spectre-1 to </i> Ghost.
<i>Do you copy?</i>

13:43.290 --> 13:44.522
<i>Spectre-2, come in.</i>

13:44.524 --> 13:46.524
Spectre-1, I read you.

13:46.526 --> 13:48.359
Where have you been, Kanan?
What's going on?

13:48.361 --> 13:50.962
<i>We found Saw Gerrera,</i>
<i>but his team is gone.</i>

13:50.964 --> 13:53.164
Gone?
<i>Hera, listen to me.</i>

13:53.166 --> 13:55.200
<i>There are operational</i>
<i>battle droids here.</i>

13:55.202 --> 13:57.969
<i>Some patrol the surface.</i>
<i>Better keep an eye out.</i>

13:57.971 --> 14:00.305
Sabine and Zeb found
a shield generator.

14:00.307 --> 14:02.874
They're out there extracting the
deflector core. <i>You have to warn them.</i>

14:02.876 --> 14:07.245
<i>Gerrera says</i>
<i>once the storm dies down,</i>
<i>the droids will be coming.</i>

14:10.349 --> 14:12.383
Looks like
the storm's letting up.

14:12.385 --> 14:16.187
HERA: <i> Spectre-4, Spectre-5.</i>
<i>Get back to the </i> Ghost
<i>immediately.</i>

14:16.189 --> 14:18.857
Affirmative, Spectre-2.
We've got the deflector core,
and we're...

14:18.859 --> 14:21.392
Leave it if you have to.
There are battle droids
in the area.

14:21.394 --> 14:22.594
I don't know how many.

14:23.662 --> 14:25.196
Battle droids?

14:25.198 --> 14:26.898
I don't see any
battle droids.

14:26.900 --> 14:28.533
I just see
a bunch of rocks.

14:32.204 --> 14:33.738
I'm not sure
those are rocks.

14:41.480 --> 14:42.647
Destroyers.

14:43.582 --> 14:44.415
Oh, no.

14:51.190 --> 14:53.758
We'll make short work
of these tin cans.

14:53.760 --> 14:56.027
No. There's too many, Zeb.

14:56.029 --> 14:58.429
If you blast one,
you'll wake them all up.

14:58.431 --> 15:00.365
SABINE: <i> Okay, what about</i>
<i>the </i> Ghost <i> cannons?</i>

15:00.367 --> 15:03.534
No good. The sandstorm's
clogged up the barrels.

15:03.536 --> 15:05.003
They're spread out enough.

15:05.005 --> 15:07.005
I guess we can just
sneak past them on foot.

15:07.007 --> 15:09.274
No. We can't just leave
the deflector core.

15:09.276 --> 15:11.242
Are you crazy?
Like Hera said,

15:11.244 --> 15:13.878
if we bump into
one of those things,
they'll all wake up.

15:13.880 --> 15:16.681
Okay, okay.
So we'll take our time
and we'll go carefully.

15:16.683 --> 15:19.117
Are you sure
it's not too big
to make it through?

15:19.119 --> 15:20.518
Hey, you made it
through.

15:21.587 --> 15:22.854
Good point.

15:44.109 --> 15:46.144
HERA: <i> All right, boys.</i>
<i>I'm calling it.</i>

15:46.146 --> 15:50.081
<i>Get back to the surface</i>
<i>before these battle droids</i>
<i>or anything else wakes up.</i>

15:50.083 --> 15:51.316
Copy that, Hera.

15:51.318 --> 15:52.884
Now wait a minute.
We're not going anywhere.

15:52.886 --> 15:54.452
We need to go
help our friends.

15:54.454 --> 15:55.920
Want to help
your friends?

15:55.922 --> 15:57.488
Then find out
who's controlling
those droids.

16:00.592 --> 16:05.196
Ezra, far side of the chasm,
directly across from us.
Do you see anything?

16:06.165 --> 16:07.498
Chopper, light it up.

16:11.637 --> 16:13.771
(CHITTERS)

16:13.773 --> 16:15.473
There! Look!

16:15.475 --> 16:18.910
I knew it!
REX: Still ugly.

16:18.912 --> 16:20.445
(SPEAKS GEONOSIAN)

16:20.447 --> 16:22.113
What's it holding?

16:22.115 --> 16:23.681
(BEEPS)

16:29.688 --> 16:32.290
Hera, the droids
are waking up!

16:32.292 --> 16:33.691
Kanan, we've got a problem.

16:33.693 --> 16:35.093
The droids
have been activated.

16:35.095 --> 16:38.496
The bug did it.
Sabine and Zeb are
in trouble. Let's go!

16:38.498 --> 16:40.865
(SPEAKS GEONOSIAN)

16:40.867 --> 16:42.934
We're not leaving
without that bug.

16:42.936 --> 16:44.869
He's not as important
as our friends.

16:44.871 --> 16:46.304
You'll never reach them
in time.

16:46.306 --> 16:48.773
We capture the bug,
we turn off the droids,

16:48.775 --> 16:50.708
we save your friends.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.143
What do you think, Hera?

16:52.145 --> 16:54.779
It's a good plan.
Get the bug.

16:54.781 --> 16:56.614
Ezra, I'm sending you
over there on three.

16:59.952 --> 17:02.920
One. Two. Three!

17:08.494 --> 17:09.794
(GRUNTS)

17:10.863 --> 17:12.430
Chopper, go with him.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.667
Even with your help,
I can't jump that far.

17:16.669 --> 17:18.569
I've got a better idea.

17:25.511 --> 17:27.145
You thinking
what I'm thinking?

17:27.147 --> 17:28.746
For once, yes.

17:28.748 --> 17:31.549
ZEB: <i> What about</i>
<i>the deflector core?</i>
SABINE: <i> Leave it.</i>

17:34.720 --> 17:37.255
Zeb, Sabine, wait.
Don't leave it. Use it!

17:37.257 --> 17:40.591
How, exactly?
It's disconnected
from the array.

17:40.593 --> 17:42.427
Wait, wait. She's right.

17:42.429 --> 17:45.596
I can tie it to
the core's power supply
and minimize the field.

17:45.598 --> 17:47.598
Minimize any faster?

17:54.006 --> 17:55.606
Huh. Not bad.

17:55.608 --> 17:56.707
Heh. Thanks.

17:56.709 --> 17:58.109
But it won't hold forever.

17:58.111 --> 18:00.244
KANAN: I need you to blast
one of those bridges loose.

18:00.246 --> 18:02.513
I think I know
what you have in mind.

18:19.798 --> 18:21.599
Get across!

18:56.768 --> 18:57.835
(PANTING)

19:01.573 --> 19:02.707
What about Kanan?

19:05.844 --> 19:07.745
Come on.
We gotta get moving.

19:07.747 --> 19:09.914
I always forget
they can do that.

19:09.916 --> 19:12.083
Yeah, but he's
no Skywalker.

19:12.085 --> 19:13.751
KANAN: I heard that.

19:18.657 --> 19:20.758
Down here. I think.

19:26.098 --> 19:27.832
Chopper, any sign of him?

19:28.934 --> 19:30.768
(GRUNTING)

19:32.804 --> 19:34.138
(GRUNTING EXCITEDLY)

19:34.140 --> 19:35.506
(CHITTERS)

19:35.508 --> 19:36.908
Go. Go!

19:40.846 --> 19:41.913
This way.

19:59.131 --> 20:01.899
Let's split up.
You go that way
and cut him off.

20:15.847 --> 20:19.317
Oh! What? Chopper!
How did he get past you?
Where did he go?

20:24.323 --> 20:26.224
Not good. Not good!

20:34.366 --> 20:36.100
(YELPS)
Gotcha.

20:36.102 --> 20:37.768
(GRUNTING)

20:40.038 --> 20:41.105
(GRUNTS)

20:41.907 --> 20:43.441
Chopper, grab the remote!

(GROANS)

20:44.544 --> 20:46.310
(CHITTERS)

20:48.947 --> 20:50.848
The shield's failing!

20:51.883 --> 20:53.818
(YELPS)

20:57.856 --> 20:59.457
(GRUNTS) Huh?

21:02.127 --> 21:05.963
Ah. Mind if we
don't do that again?

21:05.965 --> 21:08.466
(WHIMPERING)

21:09.768 --> 21:11.369
It's over.

21:11.371 --> 21:13.304
That's right. We got you.

21:13.306 --> 21:15.473
(CHITTERING)

21:15.475 --> 21:18.776
And now you're gonna tell us
what's been going on here.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.978
What were you building
for the Empire?
