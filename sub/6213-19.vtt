WEBVTT

00:03.537 --> 00:04.972
And so the guy says

00:04.972 --> 00:07.474
"That's no gross
national product.

00:07.474 --> 00:08.742
That's my wife!"

00:08.742 --> 00:10.544
( <i>laughter</i> )

00:12.112 --> 00:14.047
Now, that's funny.

00:14.047 --> 00:15.549
Oh, there is nothing
I like more

00:15.549 --> 00:18.218
than a good supply-side
economics joke.

00:18.218 --> 00:20.954
( <i>laughing</i> ):
How about that.

00:20.954 --> 00:22.856
Lobbying for
a better grade?

00:22.856 --> 00:23.891
Always.

00:23.891 --> 00:25.526
But I also found out,
Professor Beltran

00:25.526 --> 00:27.160
is the head
of the nominating committee

00:27.160 --> 00:28.762
for "Professor
of the Year" award.

00:28.762 --> 00:29.830
You're kind of
a long shot

00:29.830 --> 00:30.998
not being
a teacher and all.

00:30.998 --> 00:32.232
Not for me;
for my aunt Zelda.

00:32.232 --> 00:33.901
She's the best teacher
at this college.

00:33.901 --> 00:35.035
And I'm not
just saying that

00:35.035 --> 00:36.470
because my name's plastered
all over her will.

00:36.470 --> 00:38.372
But Zelda's only been
at Adams for two years.

00:38.372 --> 00:40.941
There's no way Beltran
would even consider
her for the award.

00:40.941 --> 00:42.543
SABRINA:
That girl,
on the other hand

00:42.543 --> 00:44.144
is going to get an "A"
in economics.

00:44.144 --> 00:47.047
Maybe there's a way
you can plant the idea
of Zelda in his head.

00:47.047 --> 00:49.149
Plant the idea in his head...

00:49.616 --> 00:51.251
That's a great idea, Roxie.

00:52.452 --> 00:53.453
Excuse me.

00:53.453 --> 00:55.255
I've got
some seeds to sow.

01:14.341 --> 01:16.343
( <i>chuckles</i> ):
I love gardening.

01:20.514 --> 01:27.220
♪ Life's changing around me,
and I'm gonna make it mine ♪

01:27.220 --> 01:33.260
♪ I'm reaching out
and living by my rules... ♪

01:33.260 --> 01:36.430
♪ Time's moving way too fast ♪

01:36.430 --> 01:40.133
♪ I wanna make it last... ♪

01:42.569 --> 01:46.073
♪ 'Cause I'm out on my own now ♪

01:46.073 --> 01:50.377
♪ And I like the way it feels. ♪

01:59.653 --> 02:00.687
I've been staring
at her long enough.

02:00.687 --> 02:01.955
The faster
I ask her out

02:01.955 --> 02:03.490
the faster I can
get rejected

02:03.490 --> 02:04.858
and begin
the healing process.

02:05.092 --> 02:06.893
It's that air
of confidence

02:06.893 --> 02:09.062
that women find
so irresistible.

02:09.062 --> 02:12.532
Hi, my name is
Miles, and I...

02:13.000 --> 02:14.968
Excuse me, I was wondering if...

02:18.572 --> 02:19.773
( <i>groans</i> )

02:22.209 --> 02:24.277
If I ever need a bouncer,
you're hired.

02:24.277 --> 02:25.646
And if you're ever going
to land a girlfriend

02:25.646 --> 02:26.947
you're going to need
professional help.

02:26.947 --> 02:29.049
The psychiatrists have
washed their hands of me.

02:29.049 --> 02:30.050
They say I'm a "downer."

02:30.050 --> 02:31.551
Forget about the shrinks.

02:31.551 --> 02:33.654
You're looking at the world's
greatest matchmaker.

02:33.654 --> 02:34.821
I have a perfect record

02:34.821 --> 02:36.556
when it comes
to shoving people together.

02:36.556 --> 02:38.358
You can set me up
with my dream girl?

02:38.358 --> 02:39.493
Yessiree, Bob.

02:39.493 --> 02:42.195
It's one of the perks of being
a nosy, intrusive yenta.

02:42.195 --> 02:45.866
I know everybody in Westbridge
and everything about them.

02:45.866 --> 02:48.101
Hey, Miriam, how
far along are you?

02:48.101 --> 02:49.536
We're having a baby?

02:49.536 --> 02:50.671
It's a boy.

02:51.204 --> 02:52.606
And I'm pretty sure
it's yours.

02:52.939 --> 02:54.341
Wow, you really
are a yenta.

02:54.341 --> 02:55.475
Maybe you can
help me.

02:55.475 --> 02:56.777
So, are you busy tonight?

02:56.777 --> 02:58.578
Wait a minute--
look who I'm asking.

02:58.578 --> 02:59.746
Well, you're busy now.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.284
You'll never guess
where I'm going.

03:04.284 --> 03:05.786
To meet with the
nominating committee

03:05.786 --> 03:07.354
for the "Professor
of the Year" award?

03:07.354 --> 03:09.523
No, I'm...
How did you know?

03:09.523 --> 03:10.891
Well, I might have
planted the idea

03:10.891 --> 03:12.059
in Professor Beltran's head.

03:12.059 --> 03:13.493
But I only got him
thinking about you.

03:13.493 --> 03:14.628
If you get the award

03:14.628 --> 03:16.129
it's because
you truly deserve it.

03:16.129 --> 03:17.397
Oh, thank you, sweetheart.

03:17.397 --> 03:20.000
I can't think of a
more wonderful honor.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.401
You said the same thing
when you won

03:21.401 --> 03:23.170
"Rumrunner of the Year"
during Prohibition.

03:23.170 --> 03:24.337
That may be true

03:24.337 --> 03:27.474
but of all the jobs
I've had in the last 600 years

03:27.474 --> 03:29.109
I really think
inspiring young people

03:29.109 --> 03:30.811
is my true calling.

03:30.811 --> 03:32.446
Oh, to be recognized
by my peers

03:32.446 --> 03:34.081
would just be icing
on the cake.

03:34.081 --> 03:35.148
There's going
to be cake?

03:35.148 --> 03:36.516
There will be
if she wins.

03:36.516 --> 03:38.185
Oh, I'm so excited for you.
Good luck.

03:38.185 --> 03:40.520
I'll call you
the minute I hear.

03:41.321 --> 03:45.425
And I know a way to hear
without her even having to call.

03:45.425 --> 03:46.526
It's just me...

03:46.526 --> 03:48.395
your average,
humble professor.

03:49.129 --> 03:50.330
I must say,
I was quite surprised

03:50.330 --> 03:51.765
when I got your call.

03:52.799 --> 03:56.236
Ow! So this is what
a corset feels like.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.306
And I continue to be surprised.

03:59.406 --> 04:02.275
Well, let's get down
to it, shall we?

04:02.275 --> 04:03.910
Professor Spellman...

04:03.910 --> 04:05.912
you're fired.

04:06.012 --> 04:06.546
What?

04:06.546 --> 04:07.848
What?!

04:07.981 --> 04:09.116
ZELDA:
Did you just say

04:09.116 --> 04:10.717
that I'm fired?

04:11.818 --> 04:15.021
When the committee reviewed
your qualifications

04:15.021 --> 04:15.555
for "Professor of the Year"

04:15.555 --> 04:17.524
your file stated
that you had

04:17.524 --> 04:19.993
three advanced degrees
from Harvard.

04:19.993 --> 04:21.027
Oh, I do.

04:21.027 --> 04:23.096
Well, we called
Harvard to verify.

04:23.096 --> 04:26.366
They said the last Zelda
Spellman who attended there

04:26.366 --> 04:30.103
graduated in 1873.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.005
Has it really been
that long?

04:32.005 --> 04:33.373
So while it is
clear to me

04:33.373 --> 04:35.509
that you are not
150 years old

04:35.509 --> 04:39.346
I am to deduce
that you are either a liar

04:39.346 --> 04:40.680
or delusional.

04:40.680 --> 04:43.250
Are those
my only options?

04:46.887 --> 04:48.822
Okay, studly,
you're all set.

04:48.822 --> 04:49.523
Her name's Margie.

04:49.523 --> 04:51.024
You're meeting
her tonight

04:51.024 --> 04:52.425
at the Takahana
Steak House.

04:52.425 --> 04:54.127
Does it matter that
I don't eat red meat

04:54.127 --> 04:55.262
and I'm allergic
to tempura?

04:55.262 --> 04:56.263
No. Trust me.

04:56.263 --> 04:57.264
You'll love it.

04:57.264 --> 04:58.365
Everything's served
in a boat.

04:58.365 --> 04:59.666
Hilda,
here she comes.

05:04.538 --> 05:06.873
I am so, so sorry.

05:06.873 --> 05:08.408
ALL:
Surprise!

05:10.911 --> 05:13.213
Don't you just love
balloons?

05:14.114 --> 05:15.315
Apparently not.

05:15.315 --> 05:18.418
Hilda, not only
did I not get the award...

05:18.418 --> 05:19.786
I got fired.

05:19.786 --> 05:21.988
Well, that puts a damper
on the rest of the party.

05:21.988 --> 05:24.090
Ix-nay on the arty-pay!

05:24.090 --> 05:25.592
But the cake comes home
with me.

05:25.592 --> 05:26.693
Aunt Zelda,
I had no idea

05:26.693 --> 05:29.663
the committee would go
snooping through your records.

05:29.663 --> 05:30.664
Wait a minute!

05:30.664 --> 05:32.199
Why didn't they check
with Harvard

05:32.199 --> 05:33.567
when they hired you?

05:33.567 --> 05:35.435
Well, I had just
published an article

05:35.435 --> 05:36.837
in the <i>Scientific American</i>

05:36.837 --> 05:38.505
and had a galaxy
named after me.

05:38.505 --> 05:39.439
They were probably
so thrilled

05:39.439 --> 05:40.841
to have me
on the faculty

05:40.841 --> 05:42.576
that no one bothered
to check the dates.

05:42.576 --> 05:43.610
Till I came along.

05:44.010 --> 05:46.479
Honey, you have nothing
to feel bad about.

05:46.479 --> 05:48.648
Sometimes things
happen for the best.

05:48.648 --> 05:50.350
Aunt Zelda, you were
just booted out

05:50.350 --> 05:52.085
of the greatest job
you've ever had.

05:52.085 --> 05:54.287
What good can come
of that?

05:54.287 --> 05:55.355
Who knows?

05:55.355 --> 05:58.325
Maybe this is my chance
to explore new directions.

05:58.325 --> 06:00.460
You know, take on
new adventures

06:00.460 --> 06:01.628
new challenges.

06:01.628 --> 06:03.430
Wow, for someone
who's just had her dreams

06:03.430 --> 06:05.899
yanked out from under her,
you're taking it really well.

06:05.899 --> 06:09.035
When one dream dies,
another is born.

06:09.035 --> 06:12.172
Look out world,
here comes Zelda Spellman.

06:14.074 --> 06:16.343
Boy, she is really
letting you off the hook.

06:16.343 --> 06:17.677
I wouldn't.

06:17.677 --> 06:19.646
Please, she's not letting me
off the hook.

06:19.646 --> 06:22.249
She's just pretending to feel
good so I don't feel bad.

06:22.249 --> 06:23.550
Well, I'm not going to rest

06:23.550 --> 06:26.253
until she admits that she feels
bad so I can start feeling good.

06:26.586 --> 06:28.021
Or something like that.

06:32.158 --> 06:34.261
Talk about
my perfect woman.

06:34.261 --> 06:36.429
Talk about
a snowball's chance.

06:37.163 --> 06:38.498
Whatcha doing?

06:38.498 --> 06:39.866
You must be Miles.

06:39.866 --> 06:41.568
I'm Margie. I already
ordered for you.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.103
Don't you just love
this place?

06:43.103 --> 06:44.537
Everything's served
in boats.

06:44.537 --> 06:45.906
Have we met before?

06:45.906 --> 06:47.140
No... Oh, guess what?

06:47.140 --> 06:48.942
I got us tickets
to the circus.

06:48.942 --> 06:50.277
You love the circus,
right?

06:50.277 --> 06:51.845
Actually, clowns terrify me.

06:51.845 --> 06:52.846
Don't be ridiculous.

06:52.846 --> 06:54.381
You'll have
a great time.

06:54.381 --> 06:55.515
Trust me.
Trust you?

06:55.515 --> 06:56.917
I'm already breaking out
in hives

06:56.917 --> 06:58.051
just smelling the tempura.

06:58.051 --> 06:59.552
But a circus--
that takes the cake.

06:59.552 --> 07:01.688
There's going
to be cake?

07:02.022 --> 07:03.123
Hi, is Aunt Zelda here?

07:03.123 --> 07:05.592
I just brought her over
a 16-pound log of chocolate

07:05.592 --> 07:07.294
to cheer her up.

07:07.294 --> 07:08.962
And just to prove
I'm truly remorseful

07:08.962 --> 07:11.064
I'm wearing horsehair
undergarments.

07:11.064 --> 07:12.332
That might fly with Zelda

07:12.332 --> 07:14.100
but how are you going
to apologize to <i>me?</i>

07:14.100 --> 07:15.635
( <i>saxophone shrieking</i> )
For what?

07:15.802 --> 07:17.003
That!

07:17.103 --> 07:19.773
Oh, for the love of all things
great and small... stop!

07:19.773 --> 07:21.675
( <i>Salem whimpering</i> )
Hi, Aunt Zelda.

07:21.675 --> 07:23.109
You sound really good.

07:23.109 --> 07:24.477
I got a saxophone.

07:24.477 --> 07:26.680
I've always wanted
to take up jazz.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.515
When are you going to <i>start?</i>

07:28.515 --> 07:30.016
So, instead of teaching

07:30.016 --> 07:32.519
you're going to become
a jazz musician?

07:32.519 --> 07:34.321
Well, I'm free to do
whatever I want.

07:34.321 --> 07:36.156
Maybe I'll be
the next Kenny G

07:36.156 --> 07:37.924
or maybe I'll be
a brain surgeon

07:37.924 --> 07:40.026
or maybe I'll get a job
pumping gas.

07:40.026 --> 07:41.594
I'm a woman with options.

07:41.594 --> 07:42.829
Options are good.

07:42.829 --> 07:44.331
And so is chocolate.

07:44.331 --> 07:45.532
Maybe later, sweetheart.

07:45.532 --> 07:47.500
Right now I've got to drain
the spit from my mouthpiece.

07:50.036 --> 07:52.405
I feel so awful about
what I did to Aunt Zelda.

07:52.405 --> 07:54.507
I've got to help her
figure out her options.

07:54.507 --> 07:56.343
Here's the only
option I see:

07:56.343 --> 07:59.112
put her in a basket
and send her down the Nile.

07:59.112 --> 08:00.480
You are so weird.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.881
It helps break up the day.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.352
All ready for my dinner party.

08:05.352 --> 08:07.320
Now all I need is... dinner.

08:09.389 --> 08:11.257
Talk about the hostess
with the mostest.

08:12.592 --> 08:14.761
Perle Mesta, eat your heart out.

08:14.761 --> 08:16.496
( <i>doorbell rings</i> )

08:18.565 --> 08:19.766
Hi, Sabrina.

08:19.766 --> 08:21.768
Oh, the table looks lovely.

08:21.768 --> 08:24.504
But I thought it was just
the two of us for dinner.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.072
Yeah, but then I thought

08:26.072 --> 08:27.874
why not entertain
a few more options?

08:30.543 --> 08:32.278
Aunt Zelda,
say hello to Lenny B.

08:32.278 --> 08:33.513
Kenny G's on tour.

08:33.513 --> 08:36.149
( <i>plays riff</i> )

08:36.149 --> 08:38.852
And this is Dr. Schwartz,
world-renowned brain surgeon.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.687
With a seven handicap.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.589
And this is Ernesto,
gas station owner.

08:42.589 --> 08:45.558
I prefer "petroleum
products engineer."

08:45.558 --> 08:46.860
Sabrina, what is going on?

08:46.860 --> 08:49.195
They're here to help you
decide what you want to do

08:49.195 --> 08:50.997
with the rest of
your life. Cool, huh?

08:50.997 --> 08:54.434
I will never understand how
this whole "playing God" thing

08:54.434 --> 08:56.036
has gotten such a bad rap.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.537
I mean, after all

08:57.537 --> 08:58.938
if you're going
to play anything

08:58.938 --> 09:00.440
it's either that
or golf, right?

09:01.374 --> 09:02.742
Hey, if you want
to get into gas

09:02.742 --> 09:03.777
you got to move quick

09:03.777 --> 09:05.478
because it's a young
person's business.

09:05.478 --> 09:06.513
Don't be ridiculous.

09:06.513 --> 09:07.580
Look at those hands.

09:07.580 --> 09:09.416
They were meant
to cut people open.

09:09.416 --> 09:11.117
Oh, and you don't think
I got nice hands?

09:11.117 --> 09:12.952
Gentlemen, please.

09:12.952 --> 09:16.489
I don't want to be
a brain surgeon or a musician

09:16.489 --> 09:18.091
or a gas pumptress.

09:18.091 --> 09:19.993
Sabrina, I just came up
with those ideas

09:19.993 --> 09:21.161
off the top of my head.

09:21.161 --> 09:23.430
I have no idea what I want to do
with my life.

09:23.430 --> 09:25.565
Hello, whole point
of the evening.

09:27.333 --> 09:30.036
Honey, I know
you mean well, but...

09:30.036 --> 09:32.672
Look, there's a lot more
where those came from.

09:32.672 --> 09:34.741
Tinker, tailor, soldier, spy.

09:34.741 --> 09:36.943
But then I have to set
another place for dinner.

09:36.943 --> 09:38.845
Honey, no more options.

09:38.845 --> 09:40.713
All I need is
some time to think

09:40.713 --> 09:43.450
which is why I booked myself
a week at the Other Realm Spa.

09:43.450 --> 09:44.551
Well, I could come with you.

09:44.551 --> 09:45.752
You could bounce ideas off me.

09:45.752 --> 09:47.253
I really want
to help you feel better.

09:47.253 --> 09:48.655
Honey, I'm fine.

09:48.655 --> 09:51.091
I don't think it's me
you want to help feel better.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.492
It's you.

09:52.492 --> 09:53.726
You are on a serious guilt trip.

09:53.726 --> 09:56.229
I'm not on a guilt trip.

09:56.229 --> 09:57.997
Then explain the bus
in your living room.

09:59.199 --> 10:01.201
I'm here to pick up
Sabrina Spellman.

10:01.201 --> 10:02.001
What for?

10:02.001 --> 10:03.436
Your guilt trip, honey.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.405
You need help with
your baggage?

10:05.405 --> 10:06.739
I don't have any baggage.

10:06.739 --> 10:08.942
Ha. That's what they all say.

10:12.412 --> 10:13.646
Have a nice trip, honey.

10:16.049 --> 10:18.318
Uh, I think there's
been a mistake.

10:18.318 --> 10:19.652
I'm really not supposed
to be here.

10:19.886 --> 10:22.555
Oh? So you're saying
I don't know my job?

10:22.555 --> 10:26.793
Fine. Then maybe I just
won't do it anymore.

10:27.026 --> 10:28.895
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!

10:29.295 --> 10:30.964
I'm definitely meant
to be here.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.198
That's more
like it.

10:32.198 --> 10:33.600
Hi. I'm Carrie.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.802
I'm the worst person
in the entire world.

10:35.802 --> 10:38.338
I left my fiancé
at the altar.

10:38.338 --> 10:41.508
Oh, you must feel so...
of course, guilty.

10:41.508 --> 10:42.909
I'm Chad.

10:42.909 --> 10:45.778
And actually I'm
the worst person
in the world.

10:45.778 --> 10:47.080
I gave my clients

10:47.080 --> 10:48.214
such bad financial advice

10:48.214 --> 10:50.250
that most of them have had
to declare bankruptcy.

10:50.250 --> 10:52.585
Wow, compared to you two,
I'm Shirley Temple.

10:52.585 --> 10:53.786
Hardly.

10:53.887 --> 10:55.622
Well, I did accidentally

10:55.622 --> 10:58.224
get my aunt fired from
her dream job

10:58.224 --> 10:59.659
and destroy her life.

10:59.826 --> 11:03.029
Oh, my God, I'm the worst
person in the world.

11:03.029 --> 11:04.564
Now you're
catching on.

11:04.564 --> 11:05.932
So what are we
supposed to do?

11:05.932 --> 11:07.000
Just fly around up here

11:07.000 --> 11:08.668
wallowing in our
misery forever?

11:08.668 --> 11:10.170
Well, that's entirely
up to you.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.905
Once you work through
your guilt trip

11:11.905 --> 11:13.006
I let you off the bus.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.274
You want my
last cracker?

11:14.274 --> 11:15.341
Oh, no, I couldn't.

11:15.341 --> 11:16.442
I'd feel too guilty.

11:16.442 --> 11:18.912
It's going to be
a long trip.

11:27.453 --> 11:29.322
Oh, this trip is excruciating.

11:29.322 --> 11:32.258
How much longer do we have
to stay on this ride?

11:32.258 --> 11:34.294
I'm going to be
on this trip forever.

11:34.294 --> 11:36.462
I'm never going to stop
feeling guilty.

11:36.462 --> 11:37.730
So...

11:38.064 --> 11:40.867
why did you leave your
fiancé at the altar?

11:40.867 --> 11:42.835
I realized I didn't
love Roger.

11:42.835 --> 11:44.504
I knew that if
I went through
with the marriage

11:44.504 --> 11:46.506
we'd be miserable
forever.

11:46.506 --> 11:48.241
You know, Carrie,
it seems to me

11:48.241 --> 11:50.076
that you did Roger
a huge favor.

11:50.076 --> 11:51.377
I mean, if you didn't love him

11:51.377 --> 11:53.846
then you saved him from making
the biggest mistake of his life.

11:53.846 --> 11:55.782
I never looked at it
that way before.

11:57.016 --> 11:58.952
It was the right thing to do.

11:58.952 --> 12:01.354
This is the best
I've felt since...

12:03.823 --> 12:05.525
Okay, that was
fairly random.

12:05.658 --> 12:06.359
She worked through
her guilt trip

12:06.359 --> 12:07.460
so I sent her home.

12:07.460 --> 12:08.461
Well, I helped.

12:08.461 --> 12:09.762
Can you
drop me off, too?

12:09.762 --> 12:11.931
Well, I would, but
then I'd feel guilty.

12:11.931 --> 12:13.700
Maybe she'll let you off
if you help me

12:13.700 --> 12:14.901
get over my guilt.

12:14.901 --> 12:15.902
It's worth a shot.

12:15.902 --> 12:18.271
Okay, you say you gave
your clients bad advice?

12:18.271 --> 12:19.405
The worst.

12:19.405 --> 12:21.808
But did you know
it was bad when
you gave it to them?

12:21.808 --> 12:24.210
No. I even invested
my own money in
the same stocks.

12:24.210 --> 12:26.145
Come on, Chad,
this isn't your fault.

12:26.145 --> 12:28.481
Stocks are risky
by nature

12:28.481 --> 12:29.716
and you're no
Miss Cleo.

12:29.716 --> 12:30.617
You did
the best you could

12:30.617 --> 12:32.352
and that's all
anybody could ask.

12:32.352 --> 12:34.120
You're right.

12:34.654 --> 12:36.089
I have nothing
to feel guilty...

12:37.357 --> 12:39.492
Would it kill you
to let someone
say good-bye?

12:39.726 --> 12:40.960
Okay, here goes--

12:40.960 --> 12:44.764
I tried to get my aunt
elected Professor of the Year

12:44.764 --> 12:46.933
but instead, I got her fired.

12:46.933 --> 12:50.637
Okay, now that I worked through
it... ready, aim... fire.

12:51.037 --> 12:53.539
You're going to have to do
better than that.

12:53.539 --> 12:54.173
Okay.

12:54.173 --> 12:55.441
Easy.

12:55.975 --> 12:57.744
Uh, my aunt says
it doesn't bother her

12:57.744 --> 13:00.480
and not to blame myself,
so I don't.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.015
Whoo-hoo, I'm going home.

13:02.415 --> 13:04.717
Hey, hey, could you hit
that little ejecto button?

13:04.717 --> 13:06.252
I'd really like
to take a shower.

13:06.252 --> 13:08.621
You got your aunt fired?

13:08.621 --> 13:11.658
What kind of a person
would do such a thing.

13:11.658 --> 13:13.826
A really, really
guilty person.

13:16.696 --> 13:17.330
Well?

13:17.330 --> 13:18.364
Well, what?

13:18.531 --> 13:20.400
Margie--
your perfect woman.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.401
How much do you
love me right now?

13:21.401 --> 13:22.869
Feel free to heap
on the praise.

13:22.869 --> 13:25.805
It was the single worst
dating experience of my life.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.006
What are you
talking about?

13:27.006 --> 13:28.975
Margie thought you
were the perfect match.

13:28.975 --> 13:30.043
But I didn't say two words.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.878
She kept bossing me around
and cutting me off.

13:31.878 --> 13:32.912
I just think...

13:32.912 --> 13:35.348
You pick up that phone
and call her now. Go.

13:35.348 --> 13:37.483
Hilda, trust me,
we didn't click.

13:37.483 --> 13:40.753
How would you know
if you clicked or not?

13:40.753 --> 13:42.689
Honestly, you go
to all this trouble
to help people.

13:42.689 --> 13:43.656
All right, all right,
I'm calling.

13:43.656 --> 13:44.657
You bet you are.

13:44.657 --> 13:47.460
No one is screwing up
my perfect record.

13:48.127 --> 13:49.329
Hello, Margie.

13:49.362 --> 13:50.530
Ah, young love.

13:54.033 --> 13:55.802
I swear, I could
eat here every day.

13:55.802 --> 13:57.337
You haven't
touched your food.

13:57.337 --> 13:58.071
Like I said

13:58.404 --> 13:59.639
I'm highly allergic to...
Eat.

13:59.639 --> 14:00.606
Oh, great news.

14:00.606 --> 14:02.375
There's a carnival
coming to town.

14:02.375 --> 14:03.676
It'll be here
for a week.

14:03.676 --> 14:05.478
So we can go at least
seven times.

14:05.478 --> 14:09.215
How can anybody
call this a
perfect match?

14:09.215 --> 14:12.051
Just like I thought.
It's a perfect match.

14:12.685 --> 14:13.886
( <i>body thuds</i> )

14:14.487 --> 14:15.588
Oops.

14:16.022 --> 14:17.223
We've got a seat open.

14:17.890 --> 14:19.759
Look, my aunt's not mad at me

14:19.759 --> 14:21.994
so I have no reason
to feel guilty.

14:21.994 --> 14:24.097
Now let me off
this frickin' bus!

14:24.097 --> 14:26.532
Hey, Sandra Bullock,
stay behind the yellow line.

14:27.467 --> 14:29.202
( <i>sighs</i> )

14:29.469 --> 14:30.636
Where's your aunt now?

14:30.636 --> 14:32.138
She's at the Other Realm Spa

14:32.138 --> 14:35.041
figuring out her options,
which she now has,
thanks to me.

14:35.041 --> 14:36.943
If everything is the
way you say it is

14:36.943 --> 14:38.211
I'll let you go.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.512
Hang on.

14:39.812 --> 14:41.748
( <i>sighs</i> )

14:42.115 --> 14:43.916
Don't you just love the heat.

14:43.916 --> 14:45.952
Really opens up the mind.

14:45.952 --> 14:48.688
Me, I'm schvitzing
over here.

14:49.322 --> 14:52.258
Don't worry,
nobody can see us.

14:52.258 --> 14:54.427
Yes, but unfortunately,
we can see him.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.796
You know, I really do
have a wonderful life.

14:56.796 --> 14:59.265
No worries,
no responsibilities.

14:59.265 --> 15:02.101
Just an endless sea
of possibility.

15:02.101 --> 15:03.503
Do you really believe

15:03.503 --> 15:05.972
any of this malarkey
you're spouting?

15:05.972 --> 15:08.007
It's not malarkey.

15:08.007 --> 15:10.743
I am thrilled to have
all these new doors opening.

15:10.743 --> 15:12.578
There. May I
please go now?

15:12.578 --> 15:13.579
Not so fast.

15:13.579 --> 15:14.647
I smell a rat.

15:14.647 --> 15:16.549
That's just
Salem's musk.

15:16.549 --> 15:18.918
Zelda, I know you better
than you know yourself.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.386
And that scares me.

15:20.386 --> 15:22.955
You're miserable
without that job.

15:22.955 --> 15:24.357
You're right.

15:24.357 --> 15:25.591
I'm crushed.

15:25.591 --> 15:27.026
I loved
teaching

15:27.026 --> 15:28.227
at Adams.

15:28.227 --> 15:29.729
It was everything to me.

15:30.263 --> 15:35.067
When I lost that job,
my soul died a tragic death.

15:35.067 --> 15:36.402
( <i>sniffling</i> )

15:36.402 --> 15:40.706
Excuse me while I drown my
sorrows in the plunge pool.

15:40.706 --> 15:44.377
Killed her soul--
that's a new one.

15:44.377 --> 15:46.212
You've got to let me
off this guilt trip.

15:46.212 --> 15:47.380
I've got to help her.

15:47.380 --> 15:49.148
I've been doing nothing
but sitting around

15:49.148 --> 15:51.317
trying to figure out
how to make myself
feel better

15:51.317 --> 15:53.519
when really what
I should've been
doing was hel...

15:53.519 --> 15:55.988
Hey, you're pretty tricky.

15:55.988 --> 15:57.156
It's a gift.

16:00.493 --> 16:01.861
You got to love a girl

16:01.861 --> 16:04.997
who doesn't feel guilty
about sleeping in all day.

16:05.031 --> 16:07.133
Believe me,
I wasn't sleeping.

16:07.133 --> 16:09.135
Then where were you
and why do smell like...

16:09.135 --> 16:10.903
( <i>sniffs</i> )
...bus fumes and musk?

16:10.903 --> 16:13.473
I was trying out
this new cologne.

16:13.473 --> 16:16.075
It's called Guilty
by Association.

16:16.075 --> 16:18.444
Well, while you were out
sampling diesel perfume

16:18.444 --> 16:20.513
I was busy trying
to get Zelda's job back.

16:20.513 --> 16:22.415
I already got
20 signatures
from students

16:22.415 --> 16:23.783
trying to get
her reinstated.

16:23.783 --> 16:25.785
See, that's what
I should have
been doing.

16:25.785 --> 16:27.687
That's it-- I'm going
with you to help.

16:27.687 --> 16:30.056
We'll get a lot more
signatures if you
take a shower.

16:30.056 --> 16:31.991
Whoo! Good idea.

16:34.627 --> 16:35.661
So it shouldn't just be

16:35.661 --> 16:37.263
about her resume
or her credentials.

16:37.263 --> 16:39.632
It should be about the passion
she brings to the subject.

16:39.632 --> 16:40.766
I mean, come on

16:40.766 --> 16:42.802
she's a quantum physics teacher,
for crying out loud

16:42.802 --> 16:44.403
and the students still love her.

16:44.403 --> 16:46.239
I have here
over 200 signatures...

16:46.239 --> 16:48.474
Ms. Spellman, we agree
with everything you've said.

16:48.474 --> 16:51.177
We would love
to give your aunt her job back.

16:51.177 --> 16:53.346
Great. I can't
wait to tell her
the good news.

16:53.346 --> 16:54.780
I'd hold off.

16:55.781 --> 16:57.283
The only way

16:57.283 --> 16:59.285
that we can reinstate
Professor Spellman

16:59.285 --> 17:01.854
is if she were to complete
all of the course work

17:01.854 --> 17:04.223
that would be necessary
for a doctoral degree.

17:04.223 --> 17:05.591
No problem.

17:05.591 --> 17:08.261
How long will that take?
Seven years.

17:08.261 --> 17:10.897
Unfortunately, we're hiring
a replacement in three weeks.

17:10.897 --> 17:13.266
You'll have everything you need
on your desk in two weeks.

17:13.266 --> 17:14.934
That's impossible.

17:14.934 --> 17:16.369
You don't know my aunt.

17:16.369 --> 17:17.703
That's impossible.

17:17.703 --> 17:19.338
Do you want to spend
the rest of your life

17:19.338 --> 17:20.740
schvitzing in a sauna
with your cat?

17:20.740 --> 17:22.041
I'll need a sharp pencil.

17:51.437 --> 17:52.838
That's it.

17:52.838 --> 17:54.173
You did it.

17:54.173 --> 17:57.143
Okay, I'm just going
to run these over
to the college and...

18:15.194 --> 18:16.228
Nice hat.

18:16.228 --> 18:17.530
Poodle?

18:17.530 --> 18:20.099
No. Margie made me wear
the poodle yesterday.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.267
Today is ferret day.

18:21.267 --> 18:22.935
Boy, you must really
like this girl

18:22.935 --> 18:25.071
if you're willing to
walk around looking--

18:25.071 --> 18:26.939
granted-- better than
you usually look.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.074
I hate looking like this.

18:28.074 --> 18:29.709
I hate that I let her
boss me around.

18:29.709 --> 18:31.577
I hate every moment
that I'm with Margie.

18:31.577 --> 18:33.212
Why don't you just
break up with her?

18:33.212 --> 18:36.215
Why didn't the Belgians
just ask the Germans
to go around them?

18:36.215 --> 18:38.417
She is <i>the</i> most
aggressive woman
I've ever met

18:38.417 --> 18:39.251
and I'm totally
nonconfrontational.

18:39.251 --> 18:41.520
Well, maybe I can help.

18:41.520 --> 18:42.955
What if I introduced you
to somebody who could be

18:42.955 --> 18:44.190
confrontational for you?

18:44.190 --> 18:44.590
No thanks.

18:44.590 --> 18:46.692
I've been set up enough
for three lifetimes.

18:46.692 --> 18:47.693
Your choice.

18:47.693 --> 18:49.061
I'm sure you'll
look adorable

18:49.061 --> 18:50.529
in tomorrow's
ferret hat.

18:52.865 --> 18:54.667
Even though you
kept me waiting

18:54.667 --> 18:56.168
I made you a present.

18:57.136 --> 19:00.072
Take the silly hat
off the man.

19:00.072 --> 19:01.507
Who are you?

19:01.507 --> 19:04.176
Miles's girlfriend.

19:04.176 --> 19:04.910
You are?

19:05.678 --> 19:06.746
I mean, she is.

19:06.746 --> 19:07.747
Oh, yeah?

19:07.747 --> 19:09.682
Then why has
he been seeing me

19:09.682 --> 19:11.250
for the last two weeks?

19:11.250 --> 19:12.251
Because I needed
some space.

19:12.251 --> 19:14.286
But I don't anymore,
understand?

19:14.286 --> 19:16.222
Please, you're so
not this type.

19:16.222 --> 19:18.858
Margie, you're
not hearing me.

19:19.558 --> 19:20.493
Miles might be

19:20.493 --> 19:22.762
a paranoid,
conspiracy-loving
Trekkie freak

19:22.762 --> 19:25.798
but he's <i>my paranoid,</i>
<i>conspiracy-loving</i>
<i>Trekkie freak.</i>

19:25.798 --> 19:27.600
So take your carny ways
and your Asian meats

19:27.600 --> 19:29.268
and hit the road.

19:29.268 --> 19:31.270
Wow, you're even
bossier than I am.

19:31.270 --> 19:33.172
You've got yourself
a great girl.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.407
I'll miss
you, though.

19:34.407 --> 19:37.410
Most of the guys I date
don't actually wear the hats.

19:39.478 --> 19:40.379
Roxie, I...

19:40.379 --> 19:41.681
You're welcome.

19:41.681 --> 19:44.116
And next time you're trying
to find your perfect match

19:44.116 --> 19:46.185
trust your own instincts,
not someone else's.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.554
Thanks. I'll do that.

19:51.323 --> 19:53.592
Zelda, I don't know
how you did it

19:53.592 --> 19:56.529
but this is the quickest
academic tour de force

19:56.529 --> 19:58.097
I have ever encountered.

19:58.097 --> 19:59.932
Just happy to be back.

19:59.932 --> 20:02.234
Oh! Oh! smidge
of carpal tunnel.

20:02.234 --> 20:03.269
Well, I'm just happy

20:03.269 --> 20:05.004
that your niece was
so persistent.

20:05.004 --> 20:07.473
Yes, she's a pretty
amazing girl.

20:09.575 --> 20:12.078
Couldn't have
done it without her.

20:12.078 --> 20:16.348
And while Professor of the Year
is out of the question

20:16.348 --> 20:18.884
I would say that you've got
a pretty good shot

20:18.884 --> 20:20.186
at Student of the Year.

20:21.620 --> 20:22.788
Woo-hoo!

20:22.788 --> 20:23.589
Ow!

20:29.929 --> 20:31.330
Where you going?

20:31.330 --> 20:32.565
To the circus
with Margie.

20:32.565 --> 20:33.666
Miles may have
no taste

20:33.666 --> 20:34.967
but I think
she's fabulous.

20:34.967 --> 20:36.469
Hi.

20:36.469 --> 20:38.704
I just met a guy who'd
be perfect for you.

20:38.704 --> 20:40.072
You're going out
Saturday.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.107
I love this girl.

20:41.107 --> 20:42.208
And I love
your outfit.

20:42.208 --> 20:43.375
And I love
your outfit.

20:43.375 --> 20:44.677
Let's go, sister.

20:44.677 --> 20:47.680
It's enough to make
you swear off women.

20:47.680 --> 20:50.182
Okay, I've sworn off
long enough.

20:50.182 --> 20:52.618
My true love is waiting
right...

20:52.618 --> 20:54.086
here.

20:55.387 --> 20:56.489
WOMAN:
Hello?

20:56.489 --> 20:58.691
Hello, back at ya, baby.

20:58.691 --> 20:59.825
Who is this?

20:59.825 --> 21:01.527
Purr-fection in
a little furry suit.

21:01.527 --> 21:04.096
Whoever you are, I don't have
time for this, all right?

21:04.096 --> 21:05.931
I'm on the road
talking on my cell phone

21:05.931 --> 21:07.566
and this may be
one of those states

21:07.566 --> 21:09.001
where you get arrested for that.

21:09.001 --> 21:10.402
Okay, let's go a different way.

21:10.402 --> 21:11.771
Is your refrigerator running?

21:11.771 --> 21:12.605
( <i>dial tone</i> )
Hello? Hello?
