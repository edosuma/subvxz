WEBVTT

00:00.505 --> 00:01.505
<i>Previously on The Tudors...</i>

00:01.996 --> 00:04.260
We will not proceed without plans
for an invasion of France.

00:04.661 --> 00:05.661
While I'm in Bologne...

00:05.866 --> 00:06.866
Queen Catherine,
will like this regent

00:07.112 --> 00:08.220
and rule in my state?

00:08.688 --> 00:10.495
Indeed, I suspect her majesty...

00:10.496 --> 00:11.892
at being a secret protestant.

00:11.893 --> 00:12.199
And I intend...

00:12.235 --> 00:14.636
one day to prove it.

00:17.106 --> 00:19.975
- Majesty. The French consider
their strong ramparts
and double walls

00:20.042 --> 00:22.538
invulnerable to our artillery!
- We shall see about that.

00:22.606 --> 00:24.429
We've brought enough cannon here
to conquer hell.

00:24.530 --> 00:27.264
- Fire!

00:27.365 --> 00:30.167
- Majesty, the Emperor's forces
are at present besieging

00:30.268 --> 00:32.332
the fortresses of Luxembourg
and St. Didier.

00:32.433 --> 00:35.135
- We'll break our siege first
then advance on Paris.

00:35.203 --> 00:37.544
- Mr. Latimer, I have a mind

00:37.611 --> 00:39.682
to appoint you chaplain
to my household.

00:39.750 --> 00:43.526
- Are you absolutely sure?
You must know my reputation.

00:43.594 --> 00:46.731
- Queen Catherine has
appointed Hugh Latimer

00:46.799 --> 00:49.607
as her private Chaplain.
- And I thought someone said

00:49.675 --> 00:51.910
she was an intelligent woman.

00:58.355 --> 01:00.858
- Ah!
- Mademoiselle?

01:00.959 --> 01:04.666
- Why won't you release me?
- So you can go on fighting
against us?

01:04.733 --> 01:06.703
- Yes! So I can
go on killing you.
- You're my prisoner now.

01:06.771 --> 01:09.073
Perhaps I'll even
get a ransom for you.
- Senor Treviso.

01:09.174 --> 01:12.413
- I intend to dig three tunnels.
The main one will be here
at the town wall.

01:12.514 --> 01:14.583
I say we could be under the
castle and able to detonate

01:14.650 --> 01:17.052
a huge explosion
in three weeks.

01:17.120 --> 01:19.223
- Two weeks.

01:19.291 --> 01:21.593
- What do you think
of Senor Treviso?

01:21.661 --> 01:24.898
Builder of tunnels.
- Do you think he's mad?

01:24.999 --> 01:27.503
- He's not the only one.

01:27.570 --> 01:30.973
- I regret to inform you
of the deaths of ten of
your Majesty's soldiers.

01:31.041 --> 01:32.909
The men all died
of the bloody flux.

01:33.010 --> 01:35.277
I'm afraid that there is now
an outbreak of the disease

01:35.378 --> 01:38.649
throughout your army. God alone
knows how many it will
take away.

- Stand ready!

04:15.448 --> 04:17.048
- Good God, man!

04:17.149 --> 04:18.983
Did you not find
anything to eat?

04:19.051 --> 04:21.786
- There's nothing
to find, my Lord.

04:21.821 --> 04:24.156
The whole countryside for miles
and miles is stripped

04:24.223 --> 04:27.659
of every sheep, cow, pig,
hare... of anything edible.

04:27.727 --> 04:30.061
We had French peasants come up
to us, crying piteously

04:30.163 --> 04:32.063
in God's name for a piece
of bread to keep alive

04:32.165 --> 04:34.065
their little ones who
are dying for want of food.

04:34.167 --> 04:36.034
- It's not their little
ones I worry about.

04:36.135 --> 04:38.803
It's my own soldiers.

04:38.838 --> 04:41.072
It's a pity the French
will not come out

04:41.174 --> 04:43.508
and break lances with us,
as they used to do.

04:45.711 --> 04:49.047
Then I could truly fancy I was
Lancelot Du Lac.

04:49.148 --> 04:51.550
Instead of sitting here
in our own shit

04:51.684 --> 04:54.719
and starving to death!

04:54.854 --> 04:58.423
Except for the bastards
who try and run away!

04:58.524 --> 05:00.725
- Forward!

05:04.096 --> 05:06.565
Reload!

05:14.674 --> 05:16.775
- Ah! Oh!
- Run! Run!

05:18.711 --> 05:21.446
- Stop! Stop! Wait!

05:21.547 --> 05:24.282
Don't move.

05:27.286 --> 05:30.422
<i>Dai! Tornianno
a lavorare.</i>

05:30.523 --> 05:32.390
We do not have time
to be afraid, my friends.

05:32.458 --> 05:35.860
Go, back to work.

05:46.239 --> 05:48.907
- Ah! Do you know
where we are?

05:48.975 --> 05:52.077
- The castle's still
300 feet away.

05:52.144 --> 05:54.913
- Christ!

05:57.750 --> 06:01.453
- How many men have
died of the flux?
- So far?

06:01.554 --> 06:04.055
Two thousand. And a further
three thousand are sick with it

06:04.123 --> 06:06.658
and not fit to fight.

06:06.759 --> 06:09.394
The sick are using
up our limited resources.

06:09.428 --> 06:12.264
In my opinion, your Majesty,

06:12.365 --> 06:15.367
they should be separated from
the well and transported
back to England.

06:15.434 --> 06:18.536
- That would mean that I would
have to that several ships
from my blockade!

06:18.571 --> 06:21.640
What is the cause of this bloody
flux that so unmans us?

06:21.741 --> 06:24.643
- Your Majesty, there is much
disagreement as to causes.

06:24.744 --> 06:27.145
Some say it is the result
of lack of supplies.

06:27.246 --> 06:28.980
Others, by contrast,

06:29.081 --> 06:30.982
say it comes of greed,

06:31.083 --> 06:33.251
the men having gorged
themselves on unripe fruit

06:33.386 --> 06:36.454
and shellfish when
they first arrived.

06:36.555 --> 06:40.592
What is certain is that there
is no way known to man

06:40.693 --> 06:43.128
to stop its spreading
infection.

06:45.398 --> 06:47.966
If the siege should continue
for much longer,

06:48.067 --> 06:50.735
I'm afraid a great portion of
your Majesty's army will soon

06:50.770 --> 06:52.937
be dug into the fields
of Boulogne.

06:53.039 --> 06:54.973
- I will hear not
hear anymore about it!

06:55.074 --> 06:57.776
You are as much
my enemy as the French,

06:57.910 --> 07:00.979
since you seek to demoralize,
to lie about our weaknesses,

07:01.080 --> 07:02.981
and to spin tales of sickness.

07:03.082 --> 07:06.351
These men are not sick from
the flux but from cowardice!

07:06.419 --> 07:08.920
And I will
not send cowards home!

07:08.954 --> 07:12.157
They will either fight or I will
hang them by the wayside.

07:12.258 --> 07:15.560
You! Get them
from their sickbeds

07:15.594 --> 07:18.630
back into that trench, or I will
make you a head shorter.

07:18.731 --> 07:22.434
- Yes, your Majesty.

07:22.568 --> 07:25.337
- And in the future-tell
me the truth!

07:38.517 --> 07:40.985
- -Perhaps the initials
of these names...

07:41.087 --> 07:43.888
- Majesty, Bishop Gardiner
asks for an audience.

07:46.125 --> 07:48.793
- Send him in.

07:48.861 --> 07:52.263
- Majesty. Come, ladies.

07:55.634 --> 07:57.535
- Your Grace.

07:57.636 --> 08:00.472
- Your Majesty.

08:00.506 --> 08:04.075
I have come to hear if there
is any fresh news of the King

08:04.143 --> 08:06.644
and his affairs?

08:06.712 --> 08:10.315
- The King is very well
and in the best of spirits.

08:10.416 --> 08:12.484
I am told he has
never seemed happier.

08:12.551 --> 08:14.652
- We all pray

08:14.787 --> 08:17.889
for the King's life
and his success.

08:17.957 --> 08:23.962
There is one matter I should
discuss with your Majesty,

08:24.029 --> 08:27.232
since you act as Regent
in his absence.

08:27.333 --> 08:29.334
- Go on.

08:29.402 --> 08:32.169
- Having discovered
a nest of heretics

08:32.238 --> 08:35.140
among the King's musicians-
and destroyed it...

08:35.174 --> 08:37.142
We now discover
that there are heretics

08:37.208 --> 08:39.010
even in the King's
privy chambers.

08:39.111 --> 08:42.414
- Of whom do
you speak, my Lord?

08:42.515 --> 08:45.550
- The King's barber
and the royal cook.

08:45.651 --> 08:47.552
We have enough evidence

08:47.653 --> 08:51.256
to draw up this
draft indictment.

08:51.357 --> 08:54.559
All that we require
is your signature.

08:57.029 --> 09:00.932
- My Lord, I praise you for your
diligence in these matters.

09:01.033 --> 09:03.701
But I do not think it proper
to arrest men

09:03.736 --> 09:07.539
so close to the King's
person-without first asking him.

09:15.080 --> 09:17.582
Oh, and there
is one other matter.

09:17.716 --> 09:21.753
We have heard rumors of an
outbreak of plague near Windsor.

09:21.887 --> 09:24.522
So I have decided to invite
the Prince Edward

09:24.557 --> 09:26.391
to come here to court
and stay with me.

09:26.459 --> 09:30.395
- As you wish, Madam.

09:45.978 --> 09:47.879
You!
Move yourself!

09:47.947 --> 09:49.881
Sergeant,
over here!

09:49.949 --> 09:53.051
Right, men!

09:58.057 --> 10:01.559
All you boys,
let's have you now.

10:01.694 --> 10:05.296
Move it, move it!
Raise the light, boys!

10:05.397 --> 10:07.465
<i>All you, come!
- PÃ¨re!</i>

10:07.566 --> 10:11.736
<i>Papa!
- ChÃ¨re! Mon chÃ©rie.</i>

10:11.804 --> 10:14.572
<i>- Comment vas tu?</i>

10:14.707 --> 10:17.575
<i>- Je vais bien. TrÃ¨s bien.
- Mademoiselle,</i>

10:17.710 --> 10:20.278
in return for your cooperation,

10:20.379 --> 10:23.114
I have decided to allow
your father to escape.

10:23.215 --> 10:25.917
- My cooperation?

10:26.051 --> 10:28.119
- You must promise not to try
and escape yourself.

10:28.254 --> 10:31.222
Bring those
provisions over here, now!

10:31.257 --> 10:33.291
<i>- IL veux me garde
Ã  votre place</i>

10:43.168 --> 10:45.270
<i>- Vous Ãªtes beaucoup-</i>

10:52.778 --> 10:54.612
My father agrees.

10:54.680 --> 10:57.315
Thank you.

10:57.449 --> 11:00.785
- He must go now.

11:06.926 --> 11:10.828
- I'll miss you.

11:41.860 --> 11:45.830
Relee him outside the camp.

11:57.142 --> 11:59.544
Together now!

12:04.416 --> 12:06.651
Come on, up on your feet!

12:07.820 --> 12:11.322
- What about water?
- Fire!

12:11.423 --> 12:13.858
- So, how are things, Harry?

12:13.993 --> 12:16.828
- Good.

12:18.897 --> 12:21.966
- Here.
- Reload!
- Here's some food.

12:22.001 --> 12:26.404
- That's your food.
- You need it more than I do.

12:26.505 --> 12:28.873
I just sit outside
and watch the seagulls.

12:28.974 --> 12:31.009
Go on, take it!

12:34.179 --> 12:36.347
Eat it, Harry.

12:56.035 --> 12:58.403
- And the horses! The horse
is magnificent.

12:58.537 --> 13:00.004
- I bid you most welcome,
my Lord Hertford.

13:00.039 --> 13:02.040
I take it your visit here
confirms your confidence

13:02.174 --> 13:04.042
in the Queen's Regency!
- Majesty.

13:04.109 --> 13:07.011
- Majesty, I have heard
nothing but praise

13:07.079 --> 13:10.715
in all quarters for the
dedication and skill of Queen
Catherine in matters of state.

13:10.849 --> 13:14.419
She has great clarity of mind,

13:14.553 --> 13:17.889
and a woman's touch which
soothes and cures

13:17.956 --> 13:21.092
where a man would usually
rush into anger and complaint.

13:21.193 --> 13:24.395
- And the boy?

13:24.463 --> 13:27.198
- Prince Edward is well
and healthy.

13:27.232 --> 13:29.901
- A toast to his health!
- To the Prince.

13:30.035 --> 13:31.969
- To Prince Edward.
- To the Prince.

13:32.071 --> 13:33.971
Bring it round!

13:34.106 --> 13:37.742
- What is it?

13:40.446 --> 13:44.749
- I have to tell your Majesty
that I have received word that
the Emperor has seized

13:44.817 --> 13:46.718
both the fortresses
he was besieging,

13:46.752 --> 13:48.753
and has taken fifteen
hundred enemy prisoners.

13:48.821 --> 13:51.989
- What did I tell
you, Senor Treviso?

13:52.091 --> 13:55.626
I never trusted your methods.
Everything has taken too long.
- Majesty...

13:55.761 --> 13:58.963
- And you don't know how
to handle the soldiers!
None of you do!

13:59.064 --> 14:01.099
I swear to God
I could have told you.

14:01.166 --> 14:04.402
Siege warfare makes
men idle and bored.

14:04.470 --> 14:06.804
They get soft.
Isn't that right, your Grace?

14:06.939 --> 14:09.474
The men get soft.
- It's true,

14:09.575 --> 14:13.111
the camp is swarming with
prostitutes. But even so,
considering the conditions...

14:13.178 --> 14:15.012
- I want to make sure
of the troops' good behaviour

14:15.114 --> 14:17.181
in case of an assault.

14:17.316 --> 14:19.383
We shall explode one of the
charges under the castle walls

14:19.485 --> 14:22.987
prematurely-without warning.

14:23.122 --> 14:26.858
That way, we can observe the
temper and the disposition of
the troops in a sudden crisis.

14:26.925 --> 14:29.460
- Majesty, please.
Listen to me, I beg you!

14:29.595 --> 14:32.330
We are only days away
from mining under the castle...

14:32.431 --> 14:34.932
For the love of God, please.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.936
So many, many lives
lost-and for what?

14:38.971 --> 14:42.340
Majesty, give me two days.

15:01.794 --> 15:03.728
- This is your food.
Isn't it?

15:07.032 --> 15:09.667
- What about the people in the
town? What are they eating?

15:09.768 --> 15:12.303
- Their cats.
If they have cats.

15:12.337 --> 15:15.406
Cannons coming.

15:15.474 --> 15:17.675
We need some help over here!

15:22.581 --> 15:24.982
- Why did you let my father go?

15:25.050 --> 15:27.585
- I questioned him.

15:27.686 --> 15:29.587
He couldn't tell me anything
useful about the town's
defenses.

15:29.688 --> 15:31.589
- And I can?

15:31.690 --> 15:33.858
Why are you keeping me here?

15:48.040 --> 15:50.041
Are those
muskets prepared?

15:58.784 --> 16:00.685
- Lady Mary.

16:00.719 --> 16:03.855
- Your Majesty.
I wanted to show

16:03.922 --> 16:06.557
you my translation of Erasmus's
"Gospel of St. John."

16:06.692 --> 16:08.926
It is only started.

16:09.027 --> 16:11.195
But it is dedicated to you...

16:11.330 --> 16:14.832
Since I know how much
our faith matters to you.

16:20.539 --> 16:23.374
- Thank you, Lady Mary.

16:26.011 --> 16:28.379
I am deeply touched.

16:28.413 --> 16:31.515
Come!

16:37.556 --> 16:41.692
This is so nice for me. To be
with all three of you together...

16:41.727 --> 16:44.762
Which I think
is as it should be!

16:44.897 --> 16:49.066
- Edward! I'll catch you!

16:51.904 --> 16:53.905
- Prince Edward! Prince Edward!
A little decorum, please!

16:53.972 --> 16:56.641
- Edward!
- Come here, your Grace.

16:56.742 --> 17:00.111
Now, tell me,

17:00.245 --> 17:02.580
you love the Lady Bryan,
don't you?

17:02.648 --> 17:04.749
- Yes.

17:04.816 --> 17:06.751
- I think she loves you too

17:06.818 --> 17:09.887
But I think that it is time
you were breeched

17:09.922 --> 17:12.223
from the Lady Bryan
and her nurses

17:12.257 --> 17:16.060
and I think that you are
old enough to be placed with
your tutors, don't you think?

17:16.094 --> 17:19.463
- I suppose so.

17:19.564 --> 17:23.134
- Well, don't worry.
There'll be other boys too.

17:23.268 --> 17:26.270
There'll be the Duke
of Suffolk's son Henry.

17:26.305 --> 17:28.138
And it won't be all
learning languages

17:28.240 --> 17:32.143
and scriptures. You'll also
learn tennis and fencing,

17:32.244 --> 17:35.947
music and dance. Well,
that will be fun, won't it?

17:38.784 --> 17:42.453
Good night, Prince.
Lady Bryan, thank you.

17:42.521 --> 17:45.089
- Good night, your Majesty.
- Good night.

17:45.157 --> 17:47.325
- Your Majesty.

17:50.362 --> 17:52.964
- Good night, your Majesty.
- Good night, Lady Mary.

17:56.268 --> 17:59.136
Come here, young lady.
Let me hug you.

18:05.644 --> 18:08.846
I expect great things of you,
and I shall not be disappointed.

18:08.947 --> 18:11.515
- I hope not.

18:11.616 --> 18:13.651
- Now off to bed, sweet girl.

18:20.459 --> 18:24.228
Mistress Ashley-a moment.

18:24.329 --> 18:26.697
Anne.

18:36.008 --> 18:38.042
I believe that I can trust you.

18:38.143 --> 18:42.346
I think that your family
are reformers.

18:42.481 --> 18:45.349
- Yes, Madam.

18:47.853 --> 18:50.488
- Lady Elizabeth's mother,
Anne Boleyn, was also

18:50.555 --> 18:52.890
a Lutheran and a reformer.

18:53.025 --> 18:54.859
I suppose it is my duty,
therefore, to bring

18:54.926 --> 18:57.528
the daughter
up in the mother's faith.

18:57.596 --> 18:59.864
Would you have any objection
to that, Mistress Ashley?

18:59.931 --> 19:02.433
- None, your Majesty.

19:02.534 --> 19:04.368
I should be proud to help the
Princess thus honor

19:04.436 --> 19:06.370
the memory of her mother,
whose life-and whose faith...

19:06.438 --> 19:08.539
Too many so easily disparage.

19:08.673 --> 19:10.908
- Good. Then I will appoint

19:11.009 --> 19:14.378
as her tutor Roger Ascham.
He is also one of us.

19:17.049 --> 19:20.284
Mistress Ashley, this
conversation never happened.

19:20.385 --> 19:24.388
Good night.
- Good night, your Majesty.

19:24.423 --> 19:26.557
Good night.

20:24.149 --> 20:26.016
- What?

20:26.118 --> 20:28.219
- I broke my promise.

20:28.286 --> 20:31.522
I escaped.

20:31.590 --> 20:33.824
But I came back.

20:33.892 --> 20:37.495
You've got blood on your head.

21:58.677 --> 22:02.746
Take shots.
Come on! Forward!

22:18.063 --> 22:21.932
Forward! For your lives!

22:22.033 --> 22:25.603
Take the front!

22:32.677 --> 22:34.612
- Thank you.

22:34.713 --> 22:37.248
All of you.

22:37.382 --> 22:39.183
It has been an honor
and a privilege

22:39.251 --> 22:42.052
to have worked alongside
men such as you.

22:52.664 --> 22:54.932
<i>Gratia.</i>

22:57.102 --> 22:59.703
God be with you.

22:59.738 --> 23:02.373
<i>Gratia.
- God bless you, sir.</i>

23:05.610 --> 23:07.344
<i>- Gratia Mille.</i>

23:11.049 --> 23:13.217
Go.

23:37.242 --> 23:39.243
Clear the way!
Clear the way!

23:39.311 --> 23:41.278
Move
for the cannon!

24:10.975 --> 24:14.778
- Come on Girolamo, come on.

24:18.516 --> 24:21.151
- Go! Run!

24:21.286 --> 24:23.420
Run!

24:28.426 --> 24:30.961
- He lied to me!
He's a charlatan!

24:33.765 --> 24:37.434
- Girolamo's mad again!

24:49.314 --> 24:54.485
- Go, go! Run!

24:59.858 --> 25:01.725
- No!

25:01.826 --> 25:04.294
Girolamo!
- Save yourself!

25:12.003 --> 25:13.904
- Get in here,
get in here, get in here!

25:14.005 --> 25:15.906
- They're injured in the mine!

25:16.007 --> 25:20.010
- We found somebody!
Quickly, get him out!

25:41.266 --> 25:44.401
- Go on! Go on, sir!

25:44.502 --> 25:47.571
England!

26:08.226 --> 26:10.928
- The wall is down!

26:11.062 --> 26:14.298
Victory!

26:14.399 --> 26:16.400
- Is there anyone else?

26:18.303 --> 26:19.770
Are there any others?

26:19.804 --> 26:23.073
Is there anyone
else alive in there?
- No.

26:31.249 --> 26:34.251
- For the King!

26:46.064 --> 26:48.432
- England!

26:48.500 --> 26:52.402
- Section Commanders, form up!

26:52.437 --> 26:55.439
Form up your men! Prepare
to take the city!

26:55.507 --> 26:58.308
Forward!

26:58.409 --> 27:00.577
- Prepare to take the city!

27:00.612 --> 27:04.481
Prepare to take the city!
- Yes.

27:12.123 --> 27:17.528
- Children! Lady Mary! There is
great news from France!

27:21.466 --> 27:24.001
The ng has taken Boulogne.

27:24.102 --> 27:28.105
He is safe and triumphant.

27:28.139 --> 27:30.574
Your father is a hero!

27:30.608 --> 27:33.343
He has captured Boulogne!
- Kat-obviously thrilled.

27:33.444 --> 27:35.646
- I'm certain he'll be home

27:35.780 --> 27:39.650
very soon.
How wonderful.

28:12.984 --> 28:16.019
- Most victorious Prince,

28:16.120 --> 28:19.957
as Governor of Boulogne,

28:19.991 --> 28:23.760
I have no choice but to
surrender the keys of the town.

28:28.166 --> 28:30.133
- Monsieur.

28:33.671 --> 28:35.939
- I trust your Majesty will
allow the inhabitants

28:35.974 --> 28:39.142
of the town
and its unarmed garrison

28:39.177 --> 28:42.012
to leave unmolested
and in safety.

28:42.080 --> 28:44.982
- I do so swear, on my honor.

28:45.049 --> 28:49.386
Although you and your company,
despite God's will

28:49.487 --> 28:52.022
and contrary to all justice,

28:52.123 --> 28:54.658
withheld from me a town which,
being a noble part

28:54.692 --> 28:58.228
of my inheritance,
belonged to me.

28:58.329 --> 29:03.200
- Well, I congratulate
your Majesty.

29:03.267 --> 29:06.837
You have captured one of the
most beautiful towns in France.

29:19.283 --> 29:22.986
- In their great necessity,
many of them ate horseflesh.

29:23.021 --> 29:26.757
- Did you see them go out?
Even the priests were thin!

29:29.027 --> 29:30.861
- So, my Lord Hertford...

29:30.928 --> 29:34.197
Was it well done or not?

29:34.232 --> 29:36.033
Was it not God's will
that we should reclaim

29:36.067 --> 29:39.102
part of our just rights
and inheritance?

29:39.203 --> 29:43.573
- Majesty, the capture
of Boulogne will live forever
in the hearts of all Englishmen.

29:43.675 --> 29:45.942
And the eighth Henry
as well as the fifth,

29:46.044 --> 29:48.712
in the glorious annals
of our realm.

29:52.450 --> 29:56.787
- I call Boulogne
"our daughter."

29:56.888 --> 30:00.424
And I am the "King's
Highness of Boulogne!"

30:03.227 --> 30:05.062
- I look forward-
- Hertford.

30:05.129 --> 30:08.365
- Majesty.
- I have a lot
of unfinished business there.

30:10.802 --> 30:14.604
- A toast! To all.
- To all!

30:14.706 --> 30:17.574
- And to victory.
- And to victory!

30:21.479 --> 30:24.081
- Your Majesty.

30:25.950 --> 30:27.918
- Your Grace.

30:27.952 --> 30:34.424
Your Grace, I have much
to thank you for.

30:34.459 --> 30:37.728
You have distinguished yourself
above all in this campaign.

30:37.795 --> 30:39.730
- I am grateful
to your Majesty.

30:39.764 --> 30:43.100
And now, I assume,
we are march on Paris?

30:43.201 --> 30:47.738
- Why would you assume that?

30:50.274 --> 30:52.109
- Forgive me, your Majesty.
I don't understand.

30:52.176 --> 30:54.745
I thought that was the purpose
of the pact with the Emperor.

30:54.812 --> 30:58.248
- Do you suppose

30:58.282 --> 31:00.851
we should march
on Paris with half an army,

31:00.952 --> 31:04.521
with thousands of sick
soldiers, and in winter?

31:04.622 --> 31:06.990
No, your Grace,

31:07.091 --> 31:10.694
right now, Boulogne is now far
more important to me than Paris...

31:10.795 --> 31:14.264
Than ten Parises!
No, we shall back to England.

31:16.667 --> 31:18.635
We have gained
here a singular victory...

31:18.669 --> 31:22.806
And I mean to hold onto it.

31:22.940 --> 31:24.841
I shall leave Surrey
in command of the town.

31:24.909 --> 31:27.878
- Surrey?
- Yes.

31:27.945 --> 31:30.514
Is that a problem, your Grace?

31:32.984 --> 31:35.185
- No, your Majesty.

31:35.286 --> 31:37.687
- Your Grace.

32:48.593 --> 32:51.494
- I'm sorry.

32:56.667 --> 33:00.270
Is that
what you want?

33:00.371 --> 33:02.372
Move all that wood over there!

33:02.406 --> 33:05.442
- Am I free to go?

33:05.543 --> 33:08.211
- Yes.

33:08.279 --> 33:10.213
You're free to go.

33:10.281 --> 33:12.249
- You didn't ask

33:12.350 --> 33:14.384
for a ransom?

33:14.518 --> 33:16.720
- No.
- Up on your feet.

33:16.787 --> 33:20.991
- Then do you think
I'm not worth anything?

33:23.261 --> 33:25.996
- You are worth everything.

33:26.030 --> 33:28.431
Need some
more powder?

33:33.070 --> 33:36.206
- Come back with me.
- Where?

33:36.274 --> 33:38.375
- To England.

33:38.442 --> 33:41.044
- As your-
- Yes sir,
straight away, sir.

33:41.112 --> 33:42.946
- -mistress?
Your French whore?

33:43.047 --> 33:47.717
- No.
- Then what?

33:53.758 --> 33:57.193
<i>- Je t'aime</i>

33:57.261 --> 34:00.630
<i>Je t'aime. C'est tout.</i>

34:52.683 --> 34:54.918
- My Lady.

35:10.167 --> 35:13.003
- Your Majesty,

35:13.137 --> 35:15.305
it makes me so glad

35:15.373 --> 35:19.309
to see you so well and happy.

35:19.377 --> 35:21.544
And returned safe, thank God.

35:21.612 --> 35:24.647
- And victorious, thank God!

35:24.782 --> 35:28.151
- And victorious.

35:36.727 --> 35:38.995
- Kate.

35:58.816 --> 36:01.818
Bishop.

36:54.105 --> 36:56.406
- Gentlemen, for all this
celebration, I am very worried

36:56.474 --> 36:59.709
about our state of affairs.
The King's enterprise

36:59.777 --> 37:02.745
has bankrupted our exchequer.

37:02.880 --> 37:04.581
Is that not correct,
Sir Richard?

37:04.682 --> 37:06.916
- We are at our wit's end
to know how to get revenues

37:07.017 --> 37:08.952
to pay for the Boulogne
campaign,

37:09.053 --> 37:10.954
or even shift for the next
two or three months.

37:11.055 --> 37:16.092
- We are at war with France
and with Scotland;
we "ve the enmity

37:16.193 --> 37:18.528
of the bishop of Rome.
We no longer have

37:18.596 --> 37:20.530
assurances of friendship
with the Emperor.

37:20.598 --> 37:23.666
This war has proved
noisome to the realm

37:23.701 --> 37:25.735
and disastrous
for our merchants.

37:25.870 --> 37:28.705
Oh gentlemen, God help us,

37:28.772 --> 37:33.376
we live in a world where reason
and learning no longer prevail

37:33.511 --> 37:37.280
and covenants
are little regarded.

37:37.381 --> 37:41.117
- And where it seems even
our Queen is a heretic.

37:41.218 --> 37:43.720
- It's true.

37:43.787 --> 37:47.690
And it will be God's work
to destroy her.

37:58.636 --> 38:00.904
- Your Excellency.
- Excellency.

38:00.971 --> 38:04.440
- Your Excellency.
- Your Grace.

38:25.563 --> 38:27.664
- Your Majesties,

38:27.765 --> 38:30.600
you should know that,
due to my infirmity,

38:30.634 --> 38:32.936
I have applied
for a recall to Spain

38:33.070 --> 38:37.173
and am even now am awaiting
the Emperor's permission.

38:37.274 --> 38:39.475
Madam,

38:39.577 --> 38:43.146
I would like to take this
opportunity to thank you,

38:43.214 --> 38:45.949
on behalf of his Majesty
the Emperor,

38:46.016 --> 38:48.818
for all that you have done
for the Lady Mary

38:48.886 --> 38:53.623
and for fostering the friendship
between England and Spain.

38:53.657 --> 38:57.660
- Excellency, what I have done
for the Lady Mary

38:57.761 --> 38:59.996
is much less than
I would like to do,

39:00.064 --> 39:03.299
as well as being my duty
in every respect.

39:03.367 --> 39:07.270
And as for the friendship
between our two countries,

39:07.304 --> 39:09.505
I have done and will
do nothing to prevent it

39:09.640 --> 39:12.175
from growing still further,
as the friendship is

39:12.276 --> 39:15.345
so necessary
and both sovereigns...

39:15.479 --> 39:17.580
so good.

39:17.648 --> 39:20.683
- As are you, my Lady.

39:23.821 --> 39:26.155
- Excellency!

39:26.190 --> 39:28.224
- Majesty.

39:28.325 --> 39:30.226
- I hear your Master has signed

39:30.327 --> 39:32.629
a separate treaty
with the French.

39:32.696 --> 39:35.331
Is it true?

39:35.399 --> 39:37.400
I asked you if it was true!

39:37.501 --> 39:39.636
Is it so hard
a question, Eustace?

39:43.140 --> 39:45.174
- Yes, it's true, your Majesty.

39:45.242 --> 39:47.343
- And why should he do that?

39:47.378 --> 39:49.979
We were supposed to be allies.

39:50.014 --> 39:53.650
- I believe his Majesty
had no choice.

39:53.717 --> 39:55.818
He had spent too long besieging
the town of Luxembourg;

39:55.853 --> 39:58.021
His army was riddled
with disease.

39:58.088 --> 40:00.189
- He still should
not have done it!

40:00.257 --> 40:03.893
Behind my back!

40:03.994 --> 40:06.629
I trusted him...

40:06.664 --> 40:08.798
And he betrayed me.
- Your Majesty, I am sure...

40:08.866 --> 40:10.800
- No, you defended and excused
him your whole life!

40:10.868 --> 40:14.370
He is not to be trusted...

40:14.471 --> 40:18.174
And you should be relieved
that you no longer have
to lie on his behalf.

40:18.242 --> 40:22.178
You have my permission
to leave my court.

40:22.246 --> 40:26.582
I wish you a long and happy
retirement, your Excellency.

40:28.385 --> 40:30.520
- Your Majesty.

40:48.605 --> 40:52.008
- Excellency.
- Your Excellency.
- Farewell, your Excellency.

40:52.076 --> 40:55.044
- God speed, your Excellency.

41:06.056 --> 41:09.192
- She is taller than me,
isn't she?

41:09.259 --> 41:11.394
- A little.

41:11.462 --> 41:14.430
- How would you describe her?

41:14.565 --> 41:19.268
- I would describe
her as my wife.

41:19.403 --> 41:23.773
- When shall I meet her?

41:23.874 --> 41:25.408
- Do you want to meet her?

41:25.476 --> 41:27.243
- No. But your son...

41:27.378 --> 41:31.447
Henry?
Yes, sometime.

41:36.787 --> 41:38.588
What are you thinking?

41:38.655 --> 41:41.791
- That I was dead,

41:41.925 --> 41:45.895
and am alive again.

41:51.668 --> 41:54.036
Let me look at you.

42:18.095 --> 42:21.297
- Say something.

42:24.668 --> 42:26.769
- Words aren't important.

42:52.696 --> 42:56.399
- You mustn't go.
I forbid it.

42:56.500 --> 43:00.837
- My Lady, I have to.

43:00.904 --> 43:03.840
You can see how it is with me.

43:03.907 --> 43:07.210
- And what about me?

43:07.344 --> 43:09.378
- Madam, I don't think I could
have ever left you

43:09.480 --> 43:11.380
than Queen Catherine's.

43:11.482 --> 43:13.850
I believe she loves you.

43:18.322 --> 43:20.523
- She may love me.

43:20.624 --> 43:22.992
I don't know.

43:23.060 --> 43:27.129
What I do know is that
she is not of our faith.

43:27.197 --> 43:31.133
She pretends-but she is
not a Catholic.

43:31.168 --> 43:34.704
She is a heretic-and still
you leave me in her care!
- Madam...

43:34.805 --> 43:36.706
- No...

43:36.807 --> 43:40.009
No, it is not your fault.

43:40.043 --> 43:43.913
It is my fault. If I had been

43:44.014 --> 43:45.915
a boy and not a girl, none of
this would have ever happened.

43:46.016 --> 43:48.184
And England would still
be faithful.

43:48.318 --> 43:51.354
- Princess! I beg you.

43:51.421 --> 43:55.091
- I am a lot older than I was
when I first knew you.

43:57.494 --> 44:00.096
And wiser.

44:00.197 --> 44:03.199
I do not know
if I shall ever be married,

44:03.233 --> 44:06.102
or if I will ever be Queen.

44:06.203 --> 44:09.872
Probably neither.
But if I do become Queen,

44:09.907 --> 44:13.042
I swear to you now
on the Holy Gospels

44:13.076 --> 44:15.878
and on the soul of my mother,

44:15.913 --> 44:18.915
that I will make England
faithful again.

44:19.049 --> 44:21.751
I will do whatever it takes,

44:21.852 --> 44:24.453
I will burn however many
heretics I have to,

44:24.555 --> 44:27.290
I will spill as much blood
as I have to,

44:27.391 --> 44:29.926
to make this unfortunate realm
Catholic again,

44:30.060 --> 44:33.529
and heal it, so help me God.

44:52.916 --> 44:55.051
- May I?

45:11.401 --> 45:13.669
Take this ring,

45:13.770 --> 45:17.773
in memory of me.

45:21.244 --> 45:24.080
It was a gift
from the Emperor...

45:24.114 --> 45:27.083
Who received
it from your mother.

46:04.821 --> 46:06.822
- Your Majesty,

46:06.890 --> 46:09.325
we have received news that,

46:09.393 --> 46:11.661
as well as concluding
his separate peace treaty

46:11.695 --> 46:14.530
with the French at Crecy,
the Emperor has

46:14.665 --> 46:16.899
given permission for a marriage
between his daughter

46:17.000 --> 46:20.036
and the Duke of Orleans.

46:20.103 --> 46:23.305
- All right.

46:25.509 --> 46:27.643
- There is further news.

46:31.014 --> 46:33.916
We understand that the Dauphin,

46:34.017 --> 46:36.519
and an army of over 36,000 men

46:36.653 --> 46:39.021
are preparing
to march on Boulogne.

46:48.699 --> 46:51.600
- I want my victory
to be celebrated in
every house in England.

46:51.702 --> 46:54.270
It was, after all,

46:54.371 --> 46:57.239
a very glorious affair.

46:57.340 --> 46:59.208
I want you to arrange
for every bell

46:59.242 --> 47:02.545
to be rung
and a mass of Thanksgiving

47:02.679 --> 47:05.081
to be said in every church.

47:05.148 --> 47:08.718
I want the name "Boulogne"

47:08.819 --> 47:11.287
imprinted
on every English heart...

47:11.388 --> 47:14.690
Just like "Agincourt"!

47:18.061 --> 47:21.664
- Yes, your Majesty.

47:22.305 --> 47:28.723
