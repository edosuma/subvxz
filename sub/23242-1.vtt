[Music playing]

01:04.417 --> 01:07.625
[Morgan]
hi, my name
is Morgan Taylor.

01:09.041 --> 01:10.792
About four months ago,

01:10.834 --> 01:14.542
my brother hal
and his best friend Alex,

01:14.583 --> 01:18.208
they went missing
in the Mexican desert
somewhere.

01:28.500 --> 01:31.583
Nobody knows
where they went,

01:31.625 --> 01:33.709
why they went there,

01:33.750 --> 01:35.709
or how they knew
about this place.

01:37.792 --> 01:39.583
They just never
came home one day.

01:43.917 --> 01:45.500
I've been trying
to research the area

01:45.542 --> 01:48.166
to see if I can
figure it out.

01:48.208 --> 01:51.625
All I can come up with was
"zona del silencio".

01:52.625 --> 01:54.333
Things go missing there.

01:54.375 --> 01:55.542
Planes, rockets,

01:55.583 --> 01:57.417
radio signal.

01:57.458 --> 01:58.875
Apparently people, too.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.375
And the authorities,
they just joke that

02:02.417 --> 02:05.875
they were irresponsible
tourists doing god knows
what in the desert.

02:07.417 --> 02:09.709
[Morgan sniffles]

02:09.750 --> 02:13.208
[Sobbing]
he was my best friend.

02:15.875 --> 02:18.875
So I'm determined
to find them.

02:25.750 --> 02:27.709
I need to know what happened.

03:02.625 --> 03:07.125
-[Wind howling]
-[Crying]

03:18.709 --> 03:20.709
We're good?
Okay, I'm rolling.

03:20.750 --> 03:22.667
[Alex]
hey, look!
Look, I found a spot.

03:22.709 --> 03:23.917
Hey, check this out, look.

03:23.959 --> 03:25.458
You heard about
"the hills have eyes"?

03:25.500 --> 03:27.041
Well, this place has
fucking ears, too, man.

03:27.083 --> 03:29.792
[Hal]
really, really?
Could you keep it clean?

03:29.834 --> 03:31.750
All right, this is just
for you two. It's an intro.

03:31.792 --> 03:33.458
That's it.
Nothing more, okay?

03:33.500 --> 03:35.542
-Yeah, you wanna be part of it?
-I didn't know we were shooting.

03:35.583 --> 03:36.834
That's fine, all right,
we can do this.

03:36.875 --> 03:38.709
Real quickly, okay?
Goose, you ready?

03:38.750 --> 03:40.792
Goose? okay, yes.

03:40.834 --> 03:44.250
All right.
Hi, I'm hal. This is...

03:44.291 --> 03:45.792
Hi, I'm Alex.

03:45.834 --> 03:50.458
And we are the alien hunters.
Sound stupid to you?

03:50.500 --> 03:53.291
Well, not to the aliens,
it doesn't.

03:53.333 --> 03:55.917
That was terrible.
Terrible.

03:55.959 --> 03:58.166
All right, all right,
fine, leave.

03:58.208 --> 03:59.208
I'll do it.

04:00.583 --> 04:01.959
[Sighs]

04:02.000 --> 04:04.333
Hi, I'm--

04:04.375 --> 04:07.000
you are dead!
No! You are dead!

04:08.750 --> 04:10.959
[Hal snoring]

04:13.250 --> 04:17.166
As you can hear
from the carbon monoxide
explosion going on over here,

04:17.208 --> 04:19.666
and the lack
of visual connectivity,

04:19.709 --> 04:23.542
rain man over here...
Is trying to figure out
a math problem

04:23.583 --> 04:28.333
with something I call
intellectual subconscious
referencing.

04:28.375 --> 04:32.834
Yes, and clearly,
using this process,
anything is possible.

04:32.875 --> 04:36.500
And it looks like
he's gonna be at this
for a long time.

04:36.542 --> 04:39.000
Hmm?

04:39.041 --> 04:42.500
As for me, I think I found
a website that's pretty cool

04:42.542 --> 04:46.083
and that actually could be
the point of our next
adventures.

04:48.333 --> 04:50.625
Ah...

04:50.667 --> 04:53.375
Zona del silencio.

04:53.417 --> 04:59.208
It's located right here
in the mapimí reservation
in Mexico.

04:59.250 --> 05:02.667
Right there, where otherworldly
stuff happens--

05:02.709 --> 05:05.125
ufos, that type of thing.

05:05.166 --> 05:10.625
But it is actually
located on the same axis
as the Bermuda triangle.

05:10.667 --> 05:13.709
But my very,
very favorite part is

05:13.750 --> 05:17.166
is that has a biosphere
that's a visitors' center.

05:17.208 --> 05:18.500
[Hal] fuck!

05:18.542 --> 05:20.041
Fuck, it was
on the tip of my tongue.

05:20.083 --> 05:21.291
What's up?

05:21.333 --> 05:23.709
Dude, do you have it?
Like where'd it go, man?

05:23.750 --> 05:26.208
Uh, your scrap piece of paper
with a scribble written
down on it?

05:26.250 --> 05:28.542
-Yeah, it needs to be
in the in position...
-In position.

05:28.583 --> 05:30.041
...or the whole
thing doesn't work.

05:30.083 --> 05:31.417
-Okay.
-bring it over here.

05:31.458 --> 05:32.834
Here you go.

05:32.875 --> 05:34.834
What are you guys doing?
You're shooting a porno?

05:34.875 --> 05:36.583
Uh, no, actually we're
getting some work done.

05:36.625 --> 05:38.250
We're shooting
"zona del silencio."

05:38.291 --> 05:40.291
-"Zone of silence."
-"Zone of silence."

05:40.333 --> 05:42.667
-Yeah, you know it?
-Yeah, fuck, yeah.
They have a biosphere.

05:42.709 --> 05:44.542
I've been trying to tell
you about it all day.

05:46.083 --> 05:47.959
You tell 'em about
the mutated animals

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
or the fact that it gobbles up
radio and TV signals

05:51.041 --> 05:54.041
or planes go missing,
or that ufo activity abounds?

05:54.083 --> 05:55.667
Well, we were getting there.

05:55.709 --> 05:57.041
[Chuckles]
yeah.

05:57.083 --> 05:59.750
What else you been doing?

05:59.792 --> 06:01.542
Well, you know,
i been doing work.

06:01.583 --> 06:02.875
[Stammers]
what have I been doing?

06:02.917 --> 06:04.291
What have you been doing?
You been doing nothing.

06:04.333 --> 06:05.750
I've been doing research.

06:05.792 --> 06:07.166
This is not research.

06:07.208 --> 06:08.834
It takes a lot out of you,
I'll tell you what.

06:08.875 --> 06:10.375
I'm gonna have to take
a nap after this.

06:10.417 --> 06:12.834
-[Scoffs]
-here, shut up,
look here, look here.

06:12.875 --> 06:14.667
Come here, look at this.

06:14.709 --> 06:16.583
It says here,
"the zone of silence

06:16.625 --> 06:18.417
gobbles up radio
and TV signals.

06:18.458 --> 06:20.792
And in the 19th century,"
which, I don't know,

06:20.834 --> 06:22.291
that's like decades ago,

06:22.333 --> 06:25.125
"farmers reported seeing
hot pebbles fall from the sky."

06:25.166 --> 06:27.667
Ooh, I like hot pebbles.
Those are kind of cool.

06:27.709 --> 06:29.875
Fucking find
some of those, huh?

06:29.917 --> 06:31.625
Okay, oh, look,
check this out.

06:31.667 --> 06:34.000
So, "travelers
going through the zone

06:34.041 --> 06:36.792
report seeing strange
fucking lights

06:36.834 --> 06:38.458
and burning bushes."

06:38.500 --> 06:41.709
Burning bushes? That's, like,
fucking biblical, man.

06:41.750 --> 06:45.041
Dude, and check this.
Shut up, shut up,
check this out.

06:45.083 --> 06:47.208
"Two ranchers on their way
back from festivities

06:47.250 --> 06:50.125
reported seeing a glowing light
come down from the sky

06:50.166 --> 06:53.083
and spitting out glowy
humanoid creatures."

06:54.750 --> 06:58.959
-[Sighs]
-well, that sounds
a little weird.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.667
Maybe even a little...
Okay, scary, maybe, yeah.

07:02.709 --> 07:03.917
Yeah, I don't know
about that last bit.

07:03.959 --> 07:06.208
It's a bit, like...
[Shudders]

07:08.083 --> 07:09.375
What are you doing?

07:10.375 --> 07:11.875
Please, someone help us.

07:11.917 --> 07:13.583
We've been stuck out here
in the zone for--

07:13.625 --> 07:15.542
we shouldn't have done this.
This was a little too much.

07:15.583 --> 07:17.917
-This was a horrible idea.
-We are so hungry and thirsty.

07:17.959 --> 07:20.125
If anyone gets this tape,
it's hal and Alex.

07:20.166 --> 07:21.834
-We need help.
-Please send help.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.834
We need food
and water right now.

07:23.875 --> 07:28.000
So badly.
We're gonna get it right now,
as a matter of fact.

07:28.041 --> 07:29.875
-We just need provisions.
-Just kidding.

07:35.542 --> 07:37.250
Whoo!

07:38.542 --> 07:39.834
Pork and beans, my friends.

07:39.875 --> 07:41.917
This is all you need
for a camping trip.

07:43.875 --> 07:45.709
Hey, hal.

07:45.750 --> 07:47.709
Couldn't remember
what size you wear.

07:47.750 --> 07:50.125
[Fake laughs]

07:50.166 --> 07:52.291
-Get the water.
-You're a cruiser, right?

07:52.333 --> 07:55.083
-Get.
-all right,
I'm getting the water.

07:56.250 --> 07:58.041
See what I have
to deal with?

08:10.583 --> 08:12.542
Waa-ter.

08:12.583 --> 08:15.041
-Water, water, water.
-Can you just put it together
and let's go?

08:15.083 --> 08:17.291
My leg is killing me.

08:32.082 --> 08:35.000
[Hal] it's right here.
It's right-- it's right here.

08:40.125 --> 08:43.125
That's not water.

09:02.959 --> 09:04.333
You know, I heard,
like, in the 1970s

09:04.375 --> 09:07.458
that a missile got knocked
off course

09:07.500 --> 09:09.291
and landed out here.

09:09.333 --> 09:12.625
Something to do
with the magnetic fields
or something.

09:14.333 --> 09:17.291
-Where'd you read that?
-The Internet.

09:17.333 --> 09:19.125
I mean, that's why all
the meteorites, you know,

09:19.166 --> 09:21.417
they land out here.
Same principle, you know.

09:21.458 --> 09:24.041
Just like-- the magnetism
of the place

09:24.083 --> 09:26.291
just, like, sucks in
metal particles, you know?

09:26.333 --> 09:28.500
Be cool if we could find
something like that, you know?

09:29.917 --> 09:32.750
Is that because
of the triangle?

09:32.792 --> 09:35.041
It's like the Bermuda triangle
gets sucked into things?

09:35.083 --> 09:38.166
-The magnetic pull?
-I don't know, maybe it's
the same principle.

09:38.208 --> 09:41.125
Be cool if we figured
that out, though, right?

09:41.166 --> 09:43.000
I don't know about that.

09:44.917 --> 09:47.959
I got an idea
let's pull over and get
an establishing shot

09:48.000 --> 09:49.417
-of the truck for goose.
-Oh, yeah.

09:49.458 --> 09:51.125
Actually, yeah,
that's a good idea,

09:51.166 --> 09:53.500
'cause then it's just us
driving the entire time.

09:53.542 --> 09:54.542
Right.

09:55.542 --> 09:57.250
All right.

09:57.291 --> 10:00.125
I'm gonna get out.
Just go back,
so you double back--

10:00.166 --> 10:03.125
-and just drive
straight through, okay?
-Sure, yeah.

10:03.166 --> 10:06.667
Goose duct-taped this thing down
way too much.

10:06.709 --> 10:08.834
Why's he called "goose,"
anyways?

10:08.875 --> 10:11.500
You know what?
I don't know.

10:35.125 --> 10:36.834
[Hal]
okay...

10:39.875 --> 10:41.250
That's enough.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.041
[Alex chuckling]

11:07.083 --> 11:08.500
Don't say a word.

11:12.959 --> 11:14.917
So what about
your sister, Morgan?

11:14.959 --> 11:16.917
Don't talk about
my sister, Morgan.

11:16.959 --> 11:18.625
Dude, she's hot.

11:18.667 --> 11:21.208
Yeah, well, the one thing
about that is

11:21.250 --> 11:23.625
that she's my sister, okay?

11:25.208 --> 11:26.959
Doesn't make her
any less hot.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.250
Well, to me it does, yeah.
Okay?

11:31.333 --> 11:33.792
She's not my sister.

11:33.834 --> 11:35.250
-Whoa, there's a sign.
-Shit.

11:35.291 --> 11:37.166
Right there.
Yes, that's for the sign,

11:37.208 --> 11:38.792
-oh, shit, we're at the zone.
-The zone del silencio.

11:38.834 --> 11:41.750
♪ Zona del silencio... ♪
right here, easy, easy, easy.

11:41.792 --> 11:43.750
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Got it.

11:43.792 --> 11:46.250
Okay, good.
All right.

11:46.291 --> 11:49.208
-Let's do this.
-Get the stuff.
Let's go.

11:53.750 --> 11:55.625
I wish...

11:55.667 --> 11:58.417
Okay, I wish goose was here.
He's got an eye for this.

11:58.458 --> 11:59.792
Yeah, but only
one good leg, right?

11:59.834 --> 12:01.792
Yes, because it got
blown off in fallujah.

12:01.834 --> 12:04.458
He was there as a comms guy
on the front lines, okay?

12:04.500 --> 12:06.333
Come on,
let's do this already.

12:06.375 --> 12:07.875
All right, do you know
that I got medevac-ed

12:07.917 --> 12:09.458
the first day out of there,
okay?

12:09.500 --> 12:11.959
Did they ever find his leg?

12:12.000 --> 12:14.959
-All right, all right.
-Maybe there's like, an Iraqi
playing field hockey--

12:15.000 --> 12:16.458
[grunts]

12:16.500 --> 12:19.083
Hi, I'm hal.
This is Alex.

12:19.125 --> 12:20.959
Together we are
the alien hunters.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.625
-Come on, man,
that's just shit.
-We traveled 500 miles south

12:23.667 --> 12:27.375
to the chihuahua desert here
for the zona del silencio.

12:27.417 --> 12:29.291
Both:
the zone of silence.

12:29.333 --> 12:31.667
And this is where a lot
of ufo activity happens,

12:31.709 --> 12:35.000
and there's a lot of weird
creatures out here as well.

12:35.041 --> 12:38.333
-Like the glowy humanoids.
-We're not down with
the glowy humanoids.

12:38.375 --> 12:41.375
Yeah, they're a little...

-Really?
-yeah. think you nailed it.

13:33.083 --> 13:35.333
Yes, good.
You?

13:36.875 --> 13:38.917
Who else knows
besides me?

13:42.375 --> 13:45.709
Okay, hold up, I'm going
to put you on speaker.

13:45.750 --> 13:47.875
I'm gonna run some diagnostics
while I have you up.

13:47.917 --> 13:49.583
I got this wireless
going on.

13:51.250 --> 13:53.125
-Goose, can you hear me?
-Yes, really good.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.458
-As you were saying?
-I haven't told anybody else
about this.

13:55.500 --> 13:57.917
I kind of wanted
to tell Christine,

13:57.959 --> 14:00.583
but I didn't think it'd be fair
to drag her into all this.

14:00.625 --> 14:03.625
And she can kind of be
a drama queen sometimes.

14:03.667 --> 14:07.125
[Goose]
you have the GPS on?

14:07.166 --> 14:09.583
Turn it on, please.

14:09.625 --> 14:12.291
This'll help me keep a good eye
on you when the cameras fail.

14:12.333 --> 14:14.417
And when they do,
they're going to keep rolling

14:14.458 --> 14:16.083
until we get you connected
to the cloud again.

14:16.125 --> 14:19.166
-The GPS, too.
-[Morgan] Got it.
Just like we practiced.

14:19.208 --> 14:22.792
If I lose signal,
i just keep walking
until it picks up again.

14:23.917 --> 14:25.542
Hey, goose?

14:25.583 --> 14:27.709
I know I said it
a million times already,

14:27.750 --> 14:31.208
but, thank you.
I really couldn't have
done this without you.

14:31.250 --> 14:32.417
[Goose]
well, I am a marine.

14:32.458 --> 14:35.083
No man left behind.

14:35.125 --> 14:38.250
-Or woman?
-Especially women.

14:38.291 --> 14:40.458
-Now, I'm gonna let you go...
-All right.

14:40.500 --> 14:43.000
...give you some alone time
and let you focus on the road.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.375
I'll call you later.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
[Morgan]
oh, my god, oh, my god!
Border, finally.

15:12.041 --> 15:13.959
I need to practice
my Spanish,

15:14.000 --> 15:16.333
which sucks, by the way.

15:16.375 --> 15:19.291
Okay, so after I get across,
i still have a few hours

15:19.333 --> 15:22.709
to drive to durango.
I've got a hotel booked there.

15:22.750 --> 15:25.834
It's actually the same one
that hal and Alex stayed at.

15:25.875 --> 15:28.333
I'm hoping to pick up
some leads while I'm there.

15:28.375 --> 15:30.000
There's a few bars close by.

15:30.041 --> 15:33.333
Maybe someone
will remember something
useful this time.

15:33.375 --> 15:35.500
I need to get out
and stretch my legs.

15:35.542 --> 15:37.875
My butt's gone to sleep.
[Chuckles]

15:39.041 --> 15:41.000
[Speaking Spanish]

15:49.041 --> 15:50.792
[Scoffs]
what do you mean?

15:50.834 --> 15:52.542
[Speaking Spanish]

15:53.542 --> 15:54.500
No.

16:20.959 --> 16:22.041
[Sighs]

16:22.083 --> 16:23.458
It's almost 10:30 am.

16:23.500 --> 16:26.041
I've called three--
no, five of my referrals

16:26.083 --> 16:28.834
since my last contact
proved to be a bust.

16:28.875 --> 16:30.834
The lead that I had
on hal and Alex

16:30.875 --> 16:33.250
was a waiter
that they met at the bar.

16:33.291 --> 16:34.875
I went and had dinner
there last night,

16:34.917 --> 16:37.041
and he had very little
to contribute

16:37.083 --> 16:38.667
aside from hitting on me.

16:38.709 --> 16:41.250
And then this morning,
his brother Gerardo

16:41.291 --> 16:43.917
decided last minute
to not be my guide.

16:45.458 --> 16:47.875
[Music playing on tablet]

16:47.917 --> 16:49.792
Announcer on tablet:
This area near
the town of ceballos

16:49.834 --> 16:52.709
is known to the locals
as the "zona del silencio."

16:52.750 --> 16:54.750
It's one of the many
places around the world

16:54.792 --> 16:58.208
that have baffled scientists
and scholars for decades.

16:58.250 --> 17:00.250
Nothing seems
to work there properly.

17:00.291 --> 17:02.166
Forget radios and cell phones.

17:02.208 --> 17:05.959
Even compasses--
the needles will just keep
spinning and spinning.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.625
Have aliens been visiting
these sites over the centuries,

17:08.666 --> 17:11.916
and did they help shape
the world we live in today?

17:11.959 --> 17:16.125
And if so, did they concentrate
on specific locations?

17:16.165 --> 17:19.750
There are a number of reports of
ufos at the zone of silence.

17:19.791 --> 17:22.416
It's basically
Mexico's Bermuda triangle,

17:22.458 --> 17:25.040
located pretty much
on the same parallel.

17:32.667 --> 17:35.291
I know that, like,
15 miles off in that direction

17:35.333 --> 17:37.417
is where
they found hal's car.

17:37.458 --> 17:42.500
But this-- this is
the last time anybody had
any real records of them.

17:44.291 --> 17:46.041
Wish me luck.

17:58.083 --> 17:59.875
-Is this even a road?
-[Goose] Marginal.

17:59.917 --> 18:02.125
I'm not sure
when it officially ends.

18:03.125 --> 18:05.625
Five miles ago?

18:06.834 --> 18:08.375
I'm getting
some drop out in signal.

18:08.417 --> 18:10.709
-Can you hear me okay?
-It's patchy.

18:12.625 --> 18:14.291
Try your local radio.

18:14.333 --> 18:16.834
[Static]

18:16.875 --> 18:19.000
Nothing.

18:19.041 --> 18:23.333
[Static]

18:23.375 --> 18:25.625
Yeah, I'm losing
some visual signal now.

18:26.709 --> 18:28.625
Can you still hear me?

18:36.333 --> 18:37.875
[Engine stalling]

18:40.125 --> 18:42.250
Fuck.

18:42.291 --> 18:45.667
Come on. Shit.

18:45.709 --> 18:46.959
Goose, I don't know
if you're getting this,

18:47.000 --> 18:49.083
but the fucking car
just died.

18:50.417 --> 18:52.208
Oh, shit.

18:55.333 --> 18:57.750
[Car door opens]

19:08.458 --> 19:10.291
Okay, well, the car is
completely done.

19:10.333 --> 19:12.542
I'm not gonna be able
to go anywhere else with it,

19:12.583 --> 19:15.709
so I think I'm just gonna
sleep here tonight.

19:15.750 --> 19:17.208
I really wanted
to set up a camp,

19:17.250 --> 19:20.917
but I'm just too tired.

19:20.959 --> 19:23.959
I wonder if this is the same
thing that happened to hal.

19:25.458 --> 19:28.834
But I will set up
some perimeter cameras
just in case.

19:28.875 --> 19:30.792
Keep an eye on things,
you know?

20:23.750 --> 20:26.041
It is way too early
to be awake.

20:36.917 --> 20:39.709
[Goose]
so you got about 20 miles

20:39.750 --> 20:41.959
until you get to where
the guys last were.

20:42.834 --> 20:45.417
[Morgan]
all right.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.834
On foot from here on out.

20:48.875 --> 20:50.458
[Goose]
oh, don't worry
about the car.

20:50.500 --> 20:53.041
I'll make sure someone gets out
to fix it before you get back.

20:53.083 --> 20:55.542
Alternator or something,
who knows?

20:55.583 --> 20:57.250
-All right, catch you later.
-Bye, car.

21:02.834 --> 21:06.834
Well, it's about 7:45 am.

21:07.959 --> 21:10.458
Probably 60 degrees
fahrenheit.

21:12.709 --> 21:15.500
Probably in about
an hour or so

21:15.542 --> 21:18.792
it'll get up
to maybe 75, 80.

21:18.834 --> 21:21.709
Another hour after that,
up to 90.

21:23.208 --> 21:26.709
I'll probably need to cover
about 10 miles today

21:26.750 --> 21:30.500
and I'll have to set up camp

21:30.542 --> 21:31.792
and let the sun cool down,

21:31.834 --> 21:36.291
and then set out again.

21:36.333 --> 21:40.750
Just kinda hard
to believe that I'm walking in
the same footsteps as hal.

22:00.750 --> 22:02.917
I'm so hot.

22:19.458 --> 22:20.458
Oh, what's that?

22:21.458 --> 22:23.333
Looks like a burnt tree.

22:27.458 --> 22:29.417
Bush looks
kind of petrified.

22:29.458 --> 22:30.875
Am I really that scary?

22:30.917 --> 22:33.709
[Goose]
no comment.

22:33.750 --> 22:36.333
Could be what's left
of Alex's burning bush.

22:38.500 --> 22:41.250
[Morgan]
and look at these things.
What the hell are these?

22:41.291 --> 22:42.792
[Goose]
hot pebbles.

22:44.542 --> 22:47.250
Glowy humanoid creatures
would be next on the list
then, huh?

22:47.291 --> 22:48.291
[Morgan]
comforting.

22:55.834 --> 22:57.959
I'm gonna take
some of them with me.

23:19.083 --> 23:21.166
I think I might have
to stop soon, goose.

23:21.208 --> 23:22.834
[Goose]
do what you gotta do.

23:23.917 --> 23:25.959
[Morgan]
it's getting pretty hot.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.458
Fuck, there's not
much cover out here.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.208
[Goose]
looks like it might get
pretty windy out there.

23:39.542 --> 23:41.333
[Coughs]

24:03.375 --> 24:05.500
[Distorted voice]
Walking through the woods,
me and my friend,

24:05.542 --> 24:08.834
we were hunting for, um...
You know, hunting stuff.

24:08.875 --> 24:11.792
We searched miles up ahead.

24:11.834 --> 24:15.333
[Recording continues, garbled]

24:15.375 --> 24:17.834
...not supposed to be there
kind of thing, you know.

24:17.875 --> 24:20.166
And all of a sudden,
there was, like,

24:20.208 --> 24:23.041
lights came from everywhere,

24:23.083 --> 24:25.000
like, from above, mostly.

24:25.041 --> 24:28.041
And I woke up the next day

24:28.083 --> 24:30.625
and I was, like, fucking,
like, back at the car.

24:30.667 --> 24:32.792
[Recording continues, garbled]
...What happened.

24:32.834 --> 24:35.333
I've never been able
to recall.

24:35.375 --> 24:37.834
I wrote shit down.
I wrote shit down.

24:37.875 --> 24:41.542
[Recording continues, garbled]

24:41.583 --> 24:43.417
...being abducted and shit,

24:43.458 --> 24:46.917
just keywords like
"abduction" and "alien."

24:46.959 --> 24:51.208
They-- and I'll tell you,
these guys, these aliens,

24:51.250 --> 24:52.709
they fucking screw up
your mind.

24:52.750 --> 24:54.375
Afterwards, I was--

24:54.417 --> 24:58.875
it's all about,
if you see shit,
they wipe it, man.

24:58.917 --> 25:01.625
They fucking wipe it.
I was fucking there.

25:03.417 --> 25:05.375
[Morgan]
well, the storm hit me
pretty hard.

25:05.417 --> 25:08.125
Put me back a few hours.
Had to clean the gear a bit.

25:08.166 --> 25:09.625
It took it out of me.

25:15.041 --> 25:17.583
All right,
I'm gonna call it.

25:17.625 --> 25:19.166
[Grunts]

25:33.125 --> 25:35.083
All right, well, I finally
got my tent all set up,

25:35.125 --> 25:38.583
so I'm calling it a night
and I'm gonna get some sleep.

25:38.625 --> 25:41.000
So, good night.

25:43.417 --> 25:46.625
[Coyotes yipping]

25:48.667 --> 25:52.125
[Coyotes howling]

25:54.083 --> 25:55.583
[Goose]
i saw this cool
documentary today

25:55.625 --> 25:57.166
about mind-scrubbing aliens--

25:57.208 --> 25:59.208
[morgan] I'm more concerned
about the wolves out there.

25:59.250 --> 26:01.125
-[Goose] coyotes.
-[Morgan] Wolves have always
scared the shit out of me.

26:01.166 --> 26:03.542
-[Goose] coyotes.
-[Morgan] Still afraid of them.

26:03.583 --> 26:06.667
-Like velociraptors.
-[Goose] If I see any
of those on the scope,

26:06.709 --> 26:08.667
I'll be sure
to let you know.

26:13.625 --> 26:16.750
Hey, I'm gonna need just like
a second of privacy, okay?

26:16.792 --> 26:20.250
[Goose] yeah, okay.
I'll shut the cameras off
on my end.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.792
I'll do it. Perv.

26:23.834 --> 26:26.166
Oh, and goose?
No peeking.

26:26.208 --> 26:28.625
[Goose]
please. I'm not Alex.

26:28.667 --> 26:30.208
[Beeping]

26:43.041 --> 26:44.667
[Morgan]
it's a stunning morning.

26:46.959 --> 26:49.959
I'm a little bit behind,
so I'm gonna power down
the cameras for a bit

26:50.000 --> 26:51.667
and save some juice.

26:57.417 --> 26:58.792
Bye.

27:11.750 --> 27:13.458
[Beeps]

27:15.834 --> 27:17.208
[Beeps]

27:18.917 --> 27:20.083
[Beeps]

27:21.041 --> 27:22.625
My GPS watch says

27:22.667 --> 27:25.041
I should be getting pretty close
to where they camped out.

27:25.083 --> 27:27.333
[Beeping accelerates]

27:27.375 --> 27:28.834
It's gotta be down there
somewhere.

27:38.583 --> 27:41.750
This is it.
This is it. Oh, my god.

27:46.375 --> 27:48.834
This is the last place
that we heard from them.

27:50.792 --> 27:52.917
[Sniffling]
pork and bean can,

27:52.959 --> 27:55.208
sure sign hal's been here.

27:57.291 --> 27:59.375
Police didn't
even clean it up.

28:01.792 --> 28:02.959
[Goose]
we'll find 'em.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.834
You should camp
on higher ground.

28:04.875 --> 28:07.750
This way the cameras
will get a better view
of what's around you.

28:16.709 --> 28:18.959
[Morgan]
all right,
so this first camera

28:19.000 --> 28:22.709
I'm gonna show you here,
this is Mark.

28:22.750 --> 28:25.417
He's one of my go-pros.
Let's test him out.

28:27.500 --> 28:29.917
Mark has night vision
capabilities,

28:29.959 --> 28:32.125
which will be
very useful.

28:32.166 --> 28:35.458
I'm gonna come over here
and see this little guy.

28:35.500 --> 28:39.458
This is one
of my laser sensors,

28:39.500 --> 28:42.709
and he will connect up
to my seismograph,

28:42.750 --> 28:45.834
so if anything crosses his path,
i will know about it.

28:46.792 --> 28:50.000
Now we come over here.

28:50.041 --> 28:51.625
This guy's pretty cool.

28:52.542 --> 28:55.667
This is Matt.

28:55.709 --> 28:56.792
[Camera whirring]

28:56.834 --> 28:58.709
He is my perimeter camera.

29:01.917 --> 29:05.792
He follows anything
that gets in front of him
for up to 50 feet.

29:05.834 --> 29:07.291
It's pretty cool.

29:17.208 --> 29:20.250
And now I get to show you
my favorite camera.

29:24.917 --> 29:26.834
Now this camera's
pretty special.

29:27.875 --> 29:29.166
This one here,

29:29.208 --> 29:34.291
goose says it's an hdri
something or other.

29:34.333 --> 29:36.333
It can pick up the faintest
details in the dark,

29:36.375 --> 29:38.041
or even the surface of the sun.

29:38.083 --> 29:40.291
Whatever.
it looks cool.

29:43.291 --> 29:45.333
[Goose]
you ready to start
some testing?

29:45.375 --> 29:47.417
Plug in
the electronic gear.

29:47.458 --> 29:49.542
We'll start more localized.
I'm gonna set the scan
from here,

29:49.583 --> 29:52.333
and then after that,
we're gonna go a little bit
more outward.

29:53.583 --> 29:54.750
You set?

30:02.542 --> 30:05.542
[Static]

30:08.834 --> 30:11.834
[Static continues]

30:18.625 --> 30:20.333
Is it broken?

30:20.375 --> 30:21.750
I don't think so.

30:22.959 --> 30:24.667
It's really hot.

30:24.709 --> 30:26.375
Sensors seem to be
having a problem

30:26.417 --> 30:27.917
locking on to the source.

30:29.041 --> 30:30.500
Gonna reset.

30:30.542 --> 30:34.667
[Static]

30:34.709 --> 30:38.166
What was that?
You still there, goose?

30:38.208 --> 30:40.625
Yeah, I'm here.
I'm just resetting the scan.

31:17.834 --> 31:18.834
[Static]

31:24.750 --> 31:26.500
It's quiet.

31:29.750 --> 31:31.959
[Clicking]

31:32.000 --> 31:33.625
[Static]

31:33.667 --> 31:36.667
[Loud static]

31:43.834 --> 31:45.667
That was unexpected.

31:45.709 --> 31:47.542
-What was it?
-It had structure,

31:47.583 --> 31:49.583
almost like
a burst transmission.

31:49.625 --> 31:51.291
A what?

31:51.333 --> 31:53.291
It's a burst signal.

31:53.333 --> 31:56.500
It's an ultra-high
frequency transmission
used by the military.

31:56.542 --> 31:58.834
It pushes in
a large amount of data
in a small time

31:58.875 --> 32:01.417
so that this way
the enemy doesn't get it.

32:02.375 --> 32:04.834
Special forces.

32:04.875 --> 32:06.792
But the waveform
doesn't look right.

32:06.834 --> 32:08.834
I'm gonna run it
through some filtering
and see what pops up.

32:19.208 --> 32:21.417
[Panting]

32:23.500 --> 32:25.917
[Morgan]
fucking wolves.

32:28.709 --> 32:31.458
-[Coyotes yipping]
-Are you kidding me?

32:49.917 --> 32:51.000
What the hell is that?

32:53.250 --> 32:55.166
That is not even funny.

32:57.417 --> 32:59.917
-[Animal yips]
-What the fuck?

33:04.417 --> 33:05.709
Okay.

33:08.917 --> 33:13.917
[Wildlife chirping,
barking, howling]

33:19.625 --> 33:21.750
[Whispers]
please, god.

33:21.792 --> 33:24.709
Keep me safe.
Please watch over me.

33:24.750 --> 33:27.583
Make the sounds stop.
Just please make it quiet.

33:29.583 --> 33:32.959
[Sounds fade]

33:36.583 --> 33:39.000
Okay, somehow that's worse.

33:52.333 --> 33:54.208
Goose, it's gone
real quiet out here,

33:54.250 --> 33:56.041
which is
a little fucked up.

33:58.583 --> 34:01.250
Okay, let's get my mind
on something else.

34:01.291 --> 34:02.875
Metal detector.

34:21.458 --> 34:24.667
[Beeping]

34:47.833 --> 34:49.750
[Static]

34:53.875 --> 34:56.875
[Static]

36:02.500 --> 36:04.583
[Phone ringing]

36:10.083 --> 36:11.333
Damn it.

36:11.375 --> 36:13.458
Okay, goose,
just hang on a second.

36:13.500 --> 36:14.959
I'll head back.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.667
All right, just hang on.
I'm coming back.

36:17.709 --> 36:19.625
[Ringing continues]

36:24.917 --> 36:27.291
Goose! goose, what is it?
I'm here, what's up?

36:27.333 --> 36:29.500
[Goose]
Matt picked up something
outside the tent.

36:29.542 --> 36:30.875
Something like what?

36:30.917 --> 36:32.375
Cameras went dead before
i could pick it up.

36:32.417 --> 36:33.792
But on the headphones?

36:33.834 --> 36:37.792
Shit, yo, right there
in the camp with you.

36:37.834 --> 36:41.375
Run it again.
Let's see if we can
hear anything.

36:41.417 --> 36:43.208
[Static]

36:56.333 --> 36:58.125
[Morgan]
I'm gonna go back out.

36:58.166 --> 37:00.709
[Goose]
i don't think
that's a good idea.

37:00.750 --> 37:03.291
Just stay there where you are.
You don't know what's
out there for sure.

37:03.333 --> 37:05.125
Are you serious?

37:05.166 --> 37:07.375
Of course I'm going back out.
I have to know what it is.

37:21.417 --> 37:24.458
[Morgan]
well, whatever it is or was,
it's gone.

37:24.500 --> 37:27.625
I've been out here for over
an hour and there's nothing.

37:27.667 --> 37:29.750
Oh, my heart is pounding.

37:34.792 --> 37:37.083
Okay, let's try
the metal detector again,

37:37.125 --> 37:39.208
see if it can pick up
anything.

37:52.875 --> 37:56.041
[Metal detector clicking]

38:07.583 --> 38:10.792
[Clicking accelerates]

38:13.709 --> 38:16.875
Okay.
well, this is weird.

38:16.917 --> 38:18.875
Oh, this thing
is really close.

38:18.917 --> 38:21.333
No more than maybe 30 feet.

38:21.375 --> 38:24.083
Okay, hold on,
I'm gonna set up
the night vision.

38:35.583 --> 38:37.834
Okay, set this
to a wide-range,

38:37.875 --> 38:41.291
close-surface scan,
see what we got.

38:43.250 --> 38:45.208
Oh.

38:45.250 --> 38:47.417
This thing is,
like, right here.

38:51.333 --> 38:53.333
[Clicking continues]

38:59.625 --> 39:00.709
[Clicking accelerates]

39:00.750 --> 39:02.917
What in the world?

39:18.500 --> 39:20.375
[Clicking accelerates]

39:20.417 --> 39:22.959
This thing is, like,
right under my feet.

39:55.375 --> 39:57.583
Oh, god.

39:57.625 --> 39:59.250
Oh, my god.

40:00.750 --> 40:04.125
[Sniffling]

40:18.041 --> 40:19.917
[Goose]
Morgan, I lost you.
Are you okay?

40:19.959 --> 40:21.667
What happened?
Tell me, I want to see.

40:21.709 --> 40:23.750
[Morgan sniffles]

40:23.792 --> 40:25.917
[Morgan]
i found hal's mess kit.

40:29.875 --> 40:32.375
It's what he always
took with him camping.

40:35.917 --> 40:38.000
They're dad's.

40:43.709 --> 40:47.458
I also found all
of these camera cards.

40:58.083 --> 41:00.166
[Goose]
you found them, Morgan.

41:12.458 --> 41:15.542
For the first time,
I'm actually really scared.

41:18.458 --> 41:20.250
Goose?

41:21.709 --> 41:24.041
Goose?

41:28.709 --> 41:32.500
I'm gonna start streaming
the camera cards I found
in hal's mess kit.

41:34.083 --> 41:37.208
I'm too screwed up
to watch them right now.

41:37.250 --> 41:38.417
In the morning,
but not now.

41:38.458 --> 41:39.667
I need to clear my head.

41:39.709 --> 41:41.208
Watch the cameras, okay?

41:41.250 --> 41:43.709
[Goose]
okay, okay.
Don't you worry.

41:43.750 --> 41:47.041
You just get some sleep.

41:47.083 --> 41:50.041
[Morgan sniffles]

41:50.083 --> 41:53.125
-[Coyotes howling]
-[Morgan] Fucking wolves.

41:57.458 --> 42:00.875
How many aliens
did we find today?

42:00.917 --> 42:02.166
[Alex]
are you gonna
set up that tent?

42:02.208 --> 42:05.250
Are we gonna sleep
here tonight?

42:05.291 --> 42:07.667
I don't even
know what this is.

42:07.709 --> 42:10.458
It's extra smooth...

42:10.500 --> 42:12.917
And rare-blended.

42:12.959 --> 42:14.792
Superb.

42:14.834 --> 42:16.750
[Alex]
are you gonna
set up the tent?

42:16.792 --> 42:19.583
Dude, I don't want to get bit
by, like, snakes out here.

42:19.625 --> 42:22.083
Snakes, snakes,
snakes, snakes!

42:22.125 --> 42:24.834
Whoo-- yeah, they're--
yeah, no.

42:24.875 --> 42:28.041
That's not gonna happen.
That's not gonna happen.
It's not gonna happen.

42:28.083 --> 42:32.667
It's not gonna happen
because I set up the tent.

42:32.709 --> 42:36.041
[Alex]
you're so fucked up, man.

42:36.083 --> 42:40.250
[Hal]
you look marvelous.

42:40.291 --> 42:43.166
Dude, I'm fucking
burnt to shit.

42:43.208 --> 42:44.959
[Hal]
yeah, you are.

42:45.000 --> 42:48.125
[Sighs] I can't believe
you forgot the sunscreen.

42:48.166 --> 42:51.291
[Hal]
uh, I don't need sunscreen.

42:51.333 --> 42:53.792
I got some Portuguese in me.

42:53.834 --> 42:54.917
It allows me to tan.

42:54.959 --> 42:56.291
Yeah, what was his name?

42:56.333 --> 42:58.458
[Hal laughs]

42:58.500 --> 43:00.083
Hey.

43:00.125 --> 43:02.458
Hey, that's not cool, dude.

43:02.500 --> 43:04.458
It's not cool.

43:04.500 --> 43:05.375
[Rumbling]

43:05.417 --> 43:06.458
Shit.

43:06.500 --> 43:08.542
Did you hear that?

43:08.583 --> 43:10.500
[Hal]
uh, let me check.

43:10.542 --> 43:13.792
Just-- hal, shut up.

43:13.834 --> 43:15.083
No, seriously.
Shut the fuck up.

43:15.125 --> 43:17.333
Shut the fuck up, all right?

43:17.375 --> 43:18.959
I heard something out there.

43:19.000 --> 43:21.291
[Hal]
where?

43:21.333 --> 43:22.959
Up there, like,
coming from that mountain

43:23.000 --> 43:24.917
that we were at earlier,
you know?

43:24.959 --> 43:27.709
-[Rumbling]
-are you getting this?

43:31.041 --> 43:32.166
[Hal]
you know what I'm getting?

43:32.208 --> 43:33.375
I'm getting some
really good sunburn.

43:33.417 --> 43:34.875
I'm serious,
you fucking asshole.

43:34.917 --> 43:36.041
I'm serious, man.

43:36.083 --> 43:38.750
[Hal]
okay.

43:40.625 --> 43:41.834
-[Rumbling]
-no, listen!

43:41.875 --> 43:43.125
Did you hear that?
Did you hear that?

43:43.166 --> 43:44.542
It's like a shot or something.

43:44.583 --> 43:46.959
Like a warning
or something like that.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.166
They don't want us
out here, man.

43:48.208 --> 43:49.834
[Hal]
i did hear that.

43:49.875 --> 43:52.625
Yeah, see?
I'm not fucking around.

44:53.667 --> 44:57.250
[Beeping]

44:57.291 --> 45:01.291
[Beeping continues]

45:17.166 --> 45:18.709
[Goose]
I'm getting some readings.

45:20.500 --> 45:22.667
I think you should stay
inside your tent.

45:49.750 --> 45:53.667
[Breathing heavily]

45:57.875 --> 45:59.458
Got to check the lasers.

45:59.500 --> 46:02.375
See if anything
triggered them.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.333
Okay, the first one's fine.

46:14.375 --> 46:16.625
If something had triggered it,

46:16.667 --> 46:18.458
it would be blinking,
and it's not.

46:22.959 --> 46:24.750
Okay.

46:32.875 --> 46:35.333
Test the second one.

46:41.417 --> 46:44.750
What the fuck was that?

46:47.375 --> 46:50.750
I'm too fucking scared
to close my eyes.

46:53.250 --> 46:54.917
Okay.

46:54.959 --> 46:57.083
Calm down.

46:57.125 --> 46:59.000
This is crazy.

46:59.041 --> 47:01.917
You got to find
the other laser.

47:21.875 --> 47:24.917
Where's the third one?

47:24.959 --> 47:27.375
Where did the laser go?

47:27.417 --> 47:28.875
I know it was right here.

47:28.917 --> 47:31.625
Oh.

47:33.792 --> 47:37.000
What the hell is that?

48:05.041 --> 48:06.709
Goose?
goose, are you there?

48:06.750 --> 48:08.291
You said you got some readings
or something.

48:08.333 --> 48:10.291
What's out here?

48:10.333 --> 48:11.625
[Goose]
one of the perimeter cameras

48:11.667 --> 48:12.917
was knocked out
of position somehow.

48:12.959 --> 48:14.375
Knocked?
did I do it?

48:14.417 --> 48:16.291
[Goose]
you were still
inside the tent.

48:16.333 --> 48:17.291
Well, then what?

48:17.333 --> 48:18.291
[Goose]
i don't know.

48:18.333 --> 48:19.542
Goose, how do you not know?

48:19.583 --> 48:21.166
Is this some kind of
fucking joke?

48:21.208 --> 48:23.333
[Goose]
Morgan...

48:23.375 --> 48:27.417
Give me something.

48:27.458 --> 48:29.417
[Warbling static]

48:29.458 --> 48:33.250
[Goose]
the transmission that
you picked up yesterday?

48:33.291 --> 48:36.166
[Low growling]

48:36.208 --> 48:38.083
Just stop it.

48:42.917 --> 48:46.625
Do you know what it is?

48:52.750 --> 48:54.917
Play it again.

48:54.959 --> 48:58.250
[Static]

48:58.291 --> 49:03.041
[Low growling]

49:03.083 --> 49:06.166
A voice?

49:06.208 --> 49:07.458
[Goose]
i think so.

49:07.500 --> 49:09.250
Why would there be a voice?

49:09.291 --> 49:12.458
It only separated
by playing it back
at a certain rate.

49:12.500 --> 49:15.333
If you crank it up too fast,
it falls apart.

49:15.375 --> 49:16.917
Okay, I don't know
what that means.

49:16.959 --> 49:21.125
[Goose]
it means it's doesn't like
to be overheard.

49:23.166 --> 49:27.083
Okay, so what now?

49:27.125 --> 49:29.667
[Goose]
i don't know.

49:32.917 --> 49:34.667
Hey, goose?

49:34.709 --> 49:36.333
I found another one
of the media cards

49:36.375 --> 49:38.375
in hal's mess kit.

49:38.417 --> 49:39.875
It was in the deck of cards.

49:39.917 --> 49:41.875
[Goose]
I'm not sure that he had
the charge to upload it.

49:41.917 --> 49:43.667
You have to get
your power cells charged

49:43.709 --> 49:45.458
for your return leg tomorrow.

49:45.500 --> 49:48.166
I'm gonna go ahead and start
uploading these, okay?

49:48.208 --> 49:50.333
[Beeping]

49:50.375 --> 49:52.000
It's uploading.

50:05.291 --> 50:06.709
[Alex]
this is the last time

50:06.750 --> 50:09.709
I let dickweed
do the shopping.

50:09.750 --> 50:12.083
Hey, doofus on the phone
with mommy!

50:12.125 --> 50:14.917
It'd be most outstanding
if you could lend your expertise

50:14.959 --> 50:17.709
to getting this stove started
over here.

50:17.750 --> 50:19.083
Call your mom back later.

50:19.125 --> 50:21.375
Mom, you-- mom, you--

50:21.417 --> 50:24.709
beans? pork and beans.

50:24.750 --> 50:26.375
Plenty.

50:26.417 --> 50:28.583
Fire, what's that?

50:30.333 --> 50:31.917
[Alex]
oh, shit.

50:31.959 --> 50:33.458
Shit, hal!

50:33.500 --> 50:36.125
-Hal, get out here, man.
-What, Alex?

50:36.166 --> 50:37.291
Dude, something's
going on, man.

50:37.333 --> 50:38.542
Get out here right now.

50:38.583 --> 50:40.083
Hold on, something--
i got to go.

50:40.125 --> 50:42.375
Something's going on.

50:42.417 --> 50:45.417
[Alex]
dude, dude.

50:45.458 --> 50:47.417
What the hell is that?

50:47.458 --> 50:48.667
[Alex]
dude, your face is priceless.

50:48.709 --> 50:52.041
Don't shoot me.
Fucking shoot that.

50:52.083 --> 50:55.083
[Alex]
dude, this is just like
in the book, man.

50:55.125 --> 50:57.166
How lucky are we?

50:57.208 --> 51:00.667
[Hal]
your camera work is shoddy,
dude, come here.

51:03.083 --> 51:04.375
It's gone.

51:04.417 --> 51:06.083
Did you see how fucking fast
that thing was?

51:06.125 --> 51:08.000
It just, like, zoomed
across the sky, man.

51:08.041 --> 51:10.750
-Alex?
-shit.

51:10.792 --> 51:13.333
[Hal]
does every word out of your
mouth have to be "fuck"?

51:13.375 --> 51:15.834
I'm calling mom back.

51:15.875 --> 51:19.291
Dude, fuck mom. This is some
fox mulder shit, man.

51:19.333 --> 51:21.125
Holy Christ
in a fucking cracker.

51:25.250 --> 51:26.458
[Hal]
okay.

51:26.500 --> 51:28.583
I'm headed towards the light.

51:28.625 --> 51:32.000
It's about a mile ahead,

51:32.041 --> 51:33.208
and I'm by myself.

51:33.250 --> 51:34.959
Alex--

51:35.000 --> 51:36.750
Alex has been, like,
freaking out.

51:36.792 --> 51:38.333
He said, like, the light,
like, saw us or something.

51:38.375 --> 51:39.750
And he's, like, freaking out

51:39.792 --> 51:40.959
and he doesn't know
what's going on,

51:41.000 --> 51:45.166
so we're gonna find out
what's going on.

51:45.208 --> 51:47.083
[Grunting]

51:57.709 --> 52:00.291
Man, I am out of shape.

52:00.333 --> 52:02.834
[Coughs]

52:04.500 --> 52:05.709
Whoa.

52:08.291 --> 52:09.583
There it is.

52:10.542 --> 52:12.041
There it is.

52:12.083 --> 52:13.875
Alex!

52:17.875 --> 52:19.625
I got completely disoriented.

52:19.667 --> 52:21.959
Just flash your light
if you can hear me.

52:22.000 --> 52:24.667
[Distant clicking]

52:24.709 --> 52:27.709
If that is you, stop it!

52:27.750 --> 52:30.667
[Clicking continues]

52:37.375 --> 52:39.166
Alex?

52:41.166 --> 52:42.917
[Mutters]

52:50.083 --> 52:52.542
Alex!

52:52.583 --> 52:55.083
That's it! I'm done!

52:55.125 --> 52:56.625
I'm out of here!

52:59.375 --> 53:00.333
Don't screw with--

53:00.375 --> 53:02.250
[grunts]
stop it!

53:02.291 --> 53:03.667
-[Alex laughing]
-[Hal] God damn.

53:03.709 --> 53:07.041
Son of a bitch!

53:07.083 --> 53:11.417
Fucking goddamn
son of a cocksucker!

53:11.458 --> 53:14.458
And he calls himself a marine,
ladies and gentlemen.

53:14.500 --> 53:18.709
You could've fucking
given me a heart attack!

53:18.750 --> 53:20.709
[Alex]
sorry, man, I saw you
coming a mile away,

53:20.750 --> 53:22.625
you great oaf.

53:24.583 --> 53:26.542
What was that sound?

53:26.583 --> 53:27.959
[Alex]
what sound?

53:28.000 --> 53:29.583
You know what sound
I'm talking about.

53:29.625 --> 53:30.875
That sound
that you were making.

53:30.917 --> 53:34.125
That click, click,
click, click.

53:35.458 --> 53:36.500
[Alex]
this one?

53:36.542 --> 53:38.125
[Clicking]

53:38.166 --> 53:40.583
Stop, stop.

53:40.625 --> 53:42.792
Make the sound. Make it.

53:42.834 --> 53:45.083
[Alex]
dude, I don't know
what you're talking about.

53:48.792 --> 53:51.417
I'm done.
I'm done with this.

53:51.458 --> 53:53.834
I'm not doing this
anymore, man.

53:56.125 --> 53:58.291
[Clicking tongue]

53:58.333 --> 54:00.458
Stop it! Stop it!

54:00.500 --> 54:01.625
I'm serious.

54:01.667 --> 54:02.792
I'm not fucking with you.

54:02.834 --> 54:04.458
[Alex]
sorry, dude, sorry.

54:04.500 --> 54:06.375
I couldn't resist, man.

54:06.417 --> 54:07.542
This is not funny.

54:07.583 --> 54:09.583
What was that sound?

54:09.625 --> 54:11.000
[Alex]
dude, listen.

54:11.041 --> 54:12.959
I saw the light again, man,
about an hour ago.

54:13.000 --> 54:15.792
It went up over the mountain.

54:17.500 --> 54:19.500
I mean, seriously,
we found a ufo.

54:19.542 --> 54:20.667
I don't know, like, i--

54:20.709 --> 54:22.333
I started
to get closer to it,

54:22.375 --> 54:24.125
and, like,
it just moved away.

54:24.166 --> 54:27.166
I don't know--
i don't know wh--

54:27.208 --> 54:29.583
I don't know what it was,
man, but this is--

54:29.625 --> 54:33.041
this is done.
This is over with.

54:37.500 --> 54:38.959
Come on, come on.
We're out of here.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.458
And turn the battery off!
That's our last battery.

54:41.500 --> 54:42.542
-Turn it off.
-All right, all right.

54:42.583 --> 54:45.166
-Turn it off!
-All right!

54:56.625 --> 55:01.166
It is 1:30 in the morning,

55:01.208 --> 55:05.667
and we're gonna try
to get some sleep.

55:05.709 --> 55:10.000
It's been a long day, and--

55:14.834 --> 55:17.917
and hopefully
you won't see this,

55:17.959 --> 55:20.291
and obviously
you were right.

55:20.333 --> 55:22.041
I need to get
a better class of friend.

55:22.083 --> 55:25.583
[Alex]
I'm a classy guy.

55:25.625 --> 55:28.291
[Grunting, panting]

55:34.709 --> 55:36.792
-Dude, hal, what the fuck?
-What?

55:36.834 --> 55:38.000
Are you all right, hal?

55:38.041 --> 55:39.417
-Hal, are you okay?
-I'm fine.

55:39.458 --> 55:40.709
Okay, fine.

55:40.750 --> 55:42.417
Dude, what the fuck
was that, man?

55:42.458 --> 55:44.917
[Hal]
okay, okay, listen.

55:44.959 --> 55:47.375
Listen right now.

55:51.041 --> 55:53.959
I think whatever it was--

55:54.000 --> 55:56.625
whoa!

55:56.667 --> 55:58.083
Oh, stay, stay, stay.

55:58.125 --> 55:59.542
-Stay, stay.
-I can't.

55:59.583 --> 56:03.083
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

56:05.458 --> 56:07.375
[Sobbing]

56:41.333 --> 56:43.458
He's-- he's gone.

56:43.500 --> 56:47.750
I've been hiding here
for, like, 20 minutes.

56:47.792 --> 56:50.125
Uh...

57:36.375 --> 57:37.375
[Goose]
Morgan?

57:39.583 --> 57:42.500
I know where he is.

57:42.542 --> 57:44.583
I know where he went.

57:48.625 --> 57:51.250
Morgan?

57:54.834 --> 57:57.667
We're way--

57:57.709 --> 58:00.333
in so many ways,
we're alike.

58:05.500 --> 58:06.500
And I love you.

58:12.500 --> 58:15.417
And I know you won't stop
until you find the truth.

58:20.250 --> 58:22.291
This is for you.

58:25.750 --> 58:28.041
I'm not leaving Alex behind.

58:33.917 --> 58:35.959
You better appreciate this.

58:45.458 --> 58:49.500
If I don't make it,
they're in the rocks.

58:55.709 --> 58:58.667
[Goose]
i can't imagine hal
went too far in the time--

58:58.709 --> 59:01.625
the closest rock range
is about two klicks from you.

59:04.417 --> 59:07.500
I'm gonna upload
the coordinates
to your locator.

59:07.542 --> 59:08.959
Set your watch.

59:09.000 --> 59:11.458
-[Watch beeps]
-Got it.

59:13.583 --> 59:16.917
[Goose]
you know, so far
we've had it pretty good.

59:16.959 --> 59:19.250
Not too much interference.

59:19.291 --> 59:21.709
But at the foot of the mountain,
we may not be so lucky.

59:23.500 --> 59:25.000
I still see no reason

59:25.041 --> 59:26.959
why we can't take all this
evidence to the police.

59:27.041 --> 59:28.458
[Morgan]
because they didn't take it
seriously the first time.

59:28.500 --> 59:29.500
There's new information.

59:29.542 --> 59:31.458
They have to reopen
the case, right?

59:31.500 --> 59:32.458
[Morgan]
no.

59:32.500 --> 59:33.917
Why not?

59:33.959 --> 59:37.125
[Morgan]
i don't trust them,
that's why.

59:37.166 --> 59:40.041
Then let's go to the news,
get the footage out there.

59:40.083 --> 59:41.667
Let someone else
do the digging.

59:41.709 --> 59:44.834
Morgan, you can't ignore all
the shit that's been happening.

59:44.875 --> 59:49.208
Something is out there,
and this something came to
your tent more than once,

59:49.250 --> 59:51.959
as it did with hal and Alex,
and both of them are missing.

59:52.000 --> 59:53.792
I'm going out there.
I'm gonna get some sleep

59:53.834 --> 59:56.041
and then I'm going out
there, goose.

01:00:25.625 --> 01:00:28.834
[Low growling]

01:00:28.875 --> 01:00:31.458
[High-pitched whine]

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.542
[Morgan]
hey, goose.

01:01:24.583 --> 01:01:27.291
Okay, I'm back
at my last campsite.

01:01:27.333 --> 01:01:29.083
The GPS coordinates
that you sent

01:01:29.125 --> 01:01:31.250
point to the rocks
that hal mentioned.

01:01:31.291 --> 01:01:34.208
Looks like they're
southeast of here.

01:01:34.250 --> 01:01:37.625
They don't look too far,
but it'll be dark soon.

01:01:42.250 --> 01:01:44.125
[Goose]
I'm a bit worried
about the power.

01:01:44.166 --> 01:01:46.875
Switch off one of the cameras
for now, okay?

01:01:46.917 --> 01:01:48.083
I don't want to lose
both of them.

01:01:48.125 --> 01:01:49.333
[Morgan]
okay, I'll power it up again

01:01:49.375 --> 01:01:50.750
when I hit the base
of the rocks.

01:01:50.792 --> 01:01:52.083
[Goose]
cool.

01:01:52.125 --> 01:01:53.542
Looks like I'm nearly done
pulling apart

01:01:53.583 --> 01:01:55.250
the sound frequencies
we intercepted earlier.

01:01:55.291 --> 01:01:56.583
I'll let you know what we got.

01:01:56.625 --> 01:01:58.458
[Morgan]
only good news, though, okay?

01:02:01.458 --> 01:02:05.250
[Beeping]

01:02:11.417 --> 01:02:13.792
The scans from earlier
finished processing.

01:02:13.834 --> 01:02:15.208
I'm gonna play it, okay?

01:02:15.250 --> 01:02:17.834
[Distorted voice
stuttering]

01:02:20.834 --> 01:02:22.667
[Morgan]
sounds human.

01:02:27.291 --> 01:02:30.250
Guess that rules out
the alien abduction theory.

01:02:30.291 --> 01:02:32.250
Don't be so quick
to judge.

01:02:40.458 --> 01:02:41.875
[Goose]
let me run it through
the recognition--

01:02:41.917 --> 01:02:43.625
[morgan]
be quick, because
I'm getting close

01:02:43.667 --> 01:02:46.125
to where I might begin
to lose you.

01:02:46.166 --> 01:02:48.709
[Beeping]

01:03:02.667 --> 01:03:05.667
[Goose]
it's getting
a little patchy again.

01:03:05.709 --> 01:03:07.959
[Morgan]
yeah, it's getting steep, too.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.125
I switched the night vest
settings.

01:03:09.166 --> 01:03:11.667
Can you see okay?

01:03:11.709 --> 01:03:13.709
[Static]

01:03:14.917 --> 01:03:16.375
The GPS.

01:03:16.417 --> 01:03:18.875
My GPS seems to be
intermittent.

01:03:18.917 --> 01:03:20.125
[Goose]
hard to keep a lock in.

01:03:20.166 --> 01:03:22.375
-This sucks.
-So does this climb.

01:03:22.417 --> 01:03:23.792
[Goose]
this isn't gonna work.

01:03:23.834 --> 01:03:26.291
This pack weighs a ton
even without the tent.

01:03:33.542 --> 01:03:34.417
Lights?

01:03:34.458 --> 01:03:36.917
[Goose]
what the fuck?

01:03:36.959 --> 01:03:39.667
-Goose?
-please turn back.

01:03:39.709 --> 01:03:40.583
Goose?

01:03:40.625 --> 01:03:44.208
Morgan,
please turn back, okay?

01:03:44.250 --> 01:03:45.291
[Morgan] good-bye.

01:03:45.333 --> 01:03:48.667
[Morgan whimpering]

01:03:50.333 --> 01:03:51.750
[Morgan]
oh, my god.

01:03:55.417 --> 01:03:59.917
[Goose]
...stay put.

01:03:59.959 --> 01:04:01.542
Don't go any further.

01:04:01.583 --> 01:04:04.458
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

01:04:14.208 --> 01:04:15.667
Fuck.

01:04:15.709 --> 01:04:18.041
Goose?

01:04:18.083 --> 01:04:20.792
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

01:04:27.917 --> 01:04:30.083
What the fuck?

01:04:30.125 --> 01:04:32.959
Goose, please tell me
you saw that.

01:04:34.417 --> 01:04:37.208
Goose, are you there?

01:04:37.250 --> 01:04:39.333
Oh, I think I lost you.
Shit.

01:04:39.375 --> 01:04:41.083
Okay, fuck, fuck.

01:04:41.125 --> 01:04:42.542
I'm gonna try and find
something higher

01:04:42.583 --> 01:04:44.625
so I can get some signal.

01:04:54.125 --> 01:04:55.750
Hey, hey, goose?

01:04:55.792 --> 01:05:00.583
Um, I don't know if you're
getting any of this,

01:05:00.625 --> 01:05:05.458
but I'm pretty close
to the top.

01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:08.375
Not much further to go.

01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:16.834
I still can't see anything.
The lights are gone.

01:05:20.291 --> 01:05:22.417
Okay, I'm gonna go
a bit higher

01:05:22.458 --> 01:05:26.667
and hopefully
we can get a connection.

01:06:21.875 --> 01:06:24.917
It's getting really hard
to climb.

01:06:24.959 --> 01:06:28.333
It's so steep.

01:06:28.375 --> 01:06:32.250
Okay, I must be
100 feet up by now.

01:06:32.291 --> 01:06:35.625
[Grunts]

01:07:08.208 --> 01:07:10.458
Hal's tags.

01:07:14.458 --> 01:07:17.041
[Gasps]

01:07:17.083 --> 01:07:20.458
[Morgan screaming]

01:07:31.041 --> 01:07:36.750
[Police radio chatter]

01:07:36.792 --> 01:07:38.792
[Goose]
I'm telling you,
this is happening right now.

01:07:38.834 --> 01:07:40.750
[Man] I need to understand
what's happening right now.

01:07:40.792 --> 01:07:43.667
This girl Morgan,
you say she's been abducted?

01:07:43.709 --> 01:07:45.291
Abducted? I don't know.

01:07:45.333 --> 01:07:48.583
-All I know is--
-you don't know.

01:07:48.625 --> 01:07:50.625
-I don't know.
-You don't know.

01:07:50.667 --> 01:07:52.291
Sir, please listen to me.

01:07:52.333 --> 01:07:54.959
All I know is that we were
shooting a documentary together.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.583
I've been tracking her
for the last two days,
