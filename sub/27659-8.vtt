WEBVTT

00:04.178 --> 00:06.223
- And now on to new business.
Peralta.

00:06.267 --> 00:07.572
There's a case I'd like you
to handle.

00:07.616 --> 00:09.183
Methodist Hospital called
this morning.

00:09.226 --> 00:11.576
Apparently, a 38-year-old
investment banker

00:11.620 --> 00:13.491
was admitted last night
with a broken penis.

00:13.535 --> 00:15.145
It looks like...
- Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:15.189 --> 00:17.104
There's a finance guy
with a broken dong?

00:17.147 --> 00:19.410
Uh, methinks some
"Wolf of Wall Street" style

00:19.454 --> 00:22.065
shenana-googles have taken
place this day.

00:22.109 --> 00:24.111
Anyone care to wager a guess
as to how this happened?

00:24.154 --> 00:25.634
- Yeah, I bet he dipped it
in a pile of cocaine,

00:25.677 --> 00:27.505
got it real numb, and then hit
a croquet ball with it.

00:27.549 --> 00:29.246
- Totally possible.
- He probably sat on it.

00:29.290 --> 00:31.161
- So it got under his butt.
- Happens all the time.

00:31.205 --> 00:32.683
- Sure do.
- Ugh, you guys are horrible.

00:32.728 --> 00:34.730
And you're wrong
because he was clearly driving

00:34.773 --> 00:36.514
his Bentley naked,
tried to pee out the window,

00:36.558 --> 00:40.127
and was then struck
by a goose on the wang.

00:40.170 --> 00:42.172
Is that what happened, sir?
Was he struck by a goose?

00:42.216 --> 00:43.652
- He was actually struck
by a female coworker

00:43.695 --> 00:45.436
who claims he attempted
to sexually assault her.

00:45.480 --> 00:47.395
I really wish you had

00:47.438 --> 00:48.657
stopped us
before we started guessing.

00:48.700 --> 00:50.093
- I'm not responsible for that.

00:50.137 --> 00:51.486
Now due to
the sensitive subject matter,

00:51.529 --> 00:53.140
I think it makes sense
to partner Peralta with...

00:53.183 --> 00:55.055
- Me? Because I'm the best
at sex?

00:55.098 --> 00:56.447
- No, Hitchcock.
In fact, you know what?

00:56.491 --> 00:57.535
This isn't your week.

00:57.579 --> 00:58.667
Why don't you take
a few days off?

00:58.710 --> 01:00.103
- Sweet!

01:00.147 --> 01:02.497
Have fun working, cucks!
- What?

01:02.540 --> 01:04.281
- Captain, I'd like to work
the case with Jake.

01:04.325 --> 01:05.456
I have the time.

01:05.500 --> 01:06.936
I'm three weeks ahead
on my paperwork.

01:06.979 --> 01:08.764
- Fine. Santiago and Peralta,
talk to both parties.

01:08.807 --> 01:10.548
Get to the bottom
of this broken penis.

01:10.592 --> 01:13.551
- Wait. I just want
to say I think it's sad

01:13.595 --> 01:15.727
that we as a society can
no longer laugh at the phrase

01:15.771 --> 01:18.208
"broken penis,"
and it is my dream

01:18.252 --> 01:21.690
that we one day shall again.
Team Broken Penis on three.

01:21.733 --> 01:23.561
One, two, three...
- Broken penis!

01:23.605 --> 01:25.085
- Yeah, probably should've
seen that coming.

01:27.000 --> 01:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:45.148 --> 01:47.107
- Mr. Haggerty,
please have a seat.

01:49.805 --> 01:52.590
Oh, you can stand
if that's more comfortable.

01:52.634 --> 01:54.157
- No, it's cool.

01:54.201 --> 01:56.116
The doctor said I need
to change positions

01:56.159 --> 01:57.856
frequently so I don't form
a penile clot.

01:57.900 --> 02:00.250
- Oh, I'm not gonna barf,
so on that note,

02:00.294 --> 02:02.818
please explain the events
that led to your diaper.

02:02.861 --> 02:04.254
- So last night I was giving
my coworker,

02:04.298 --> 02:05.516
Keri, some pointers
on her trades.

02:05.560 --> 02:07.475
Told her "lever up on VTC.

02:07.518 --> 02:09.258
There's no fat tail
on the vol's wicked low."

02:09.303 --> 02:10.739
I just didn't want her
to chump it.

02:10.782 --> 02:13.176
- Right, and you spoke that way
because you were...

02:13.220 --> 02:14.743
snowboarding?
- No, we were in my office.

02:14.786 --> 02:16.266
- Yeah.
- Anyway, she just flipped out

02:16.310 --> 02:17.572
and hit me
with my favorite golf club.

02:17.615 --> 02:19.313
- Ms. Brennan is claiming
she attacked you

02:19.356 --> 02:21.315
in self-defense after you
sexually assaulted her.

02:21.358 --> 02:23.143
- Yeah,
because she's crazy.

02:23.186 --> 02:25.188
I know we're not supposed
to say that about women.

02:25.232 --> 02:27.408
I usually wouldn't go there
because I'm a huge advocate.

02:27.451 --> 02:29.540
I mean, I'm the kind of guy
who thinks Kathryn Bigelow

02:29.584 --> 02:30.933
should direct
the next "Star Wars."

02:30.976 --> 02:33.283
I've said that out loud
to other men.

02:33.327 --> 02:34.937
- Thank you, Mr. Haggerty.
We'll be in touch.

02:34.980 --> 02:37.635
- Great, thanks.
I'm gonna stand up now.

02:40.595 --> 02:42.901
Captain, sorry to interrupt.

02:42.945 --> 02:45.295
I just got off the phone with
the Department of Corrections.

02:45.339 --> 02:48.820
They wanted me to let you know
that Ernest Zumowski died.

02:48.864 --> 02:50.474
- My goodness.

02:50.518 --> 02:52.302
It's been a while
since I've heard that name.

02:52.346 --> 02:53.912
I hunted him for years

02:53.956 --> 02:57.786
and finally caught him and put
an end to his bloodlust.

02:57.829 --> 03:02.312
In some sick way, I am who I am
because of Ernest Zumowski

03:02.356 --> 03:04.880
AKA...
all: The Disco Strangler.

03:04.923 --> 03:06.664
- Oh, so you knew
who I was talking about?

03:06.708 --> 03:08.231
- Yeah, sir, you talk
about him a lot.

03:08.275 --> 03:10.364
- You know, the yo-yo was his...
all: Calling card.

03:10.407 --> 03:12.670
- Oh, I mentioned that too?
So how'd he die?

03:12.714 --> 03:14.281
- He was in
a prison transport van,

03:14.324 --> 03:15.847
and he got in
a terrible accident.

03:15.891 --> 03:17.762
It burst into flames,
and he was trapped inside.

03:20.461 --> 03:22.550
Well, well, well,
he finally did it.

03:22.593 --> 03:25.335
- Died horribly?
- Escaped.

03:25.379 --> 03:27.685
Just like he said he would
all those years ago.

03:27.729 --> 03:29.296
- I'll be coming back for you.

03:29.339 --> 03:32.821
I'm just like disco, baby.
I will never die.

03:32.864 --> 03:36.259
- True, disco will never die,
but you will...

03:36.303 --> 03:38.218
all: In your cell, punk.

03:38.261 --> 03:40.785
- Oh, so I've told that part
of the story as well?

03:40.829 --> 03:43.266
- Yes, at every
Christmas party.

03:43.310 --> 03:44.920
- Sir, I am the first to tout

03:44.963 --> 03:46.791
the capabilities
of senior citizens.

03:46.835 --> 03:48.402
I have made love to many,

03:48.445 --> 03:49.881
but the Disco Strangler
is over 80.

03:49.925 --> 03:51.883
I doubt that he could pull off
an escape like this.

03:51.927 --> 03:53.668
- Oh, that's what he wants you
to think.

03:53.711 --> 03:55.365
You're both
underestimating him.

03:55.409 --> 03:57.367
I know 28 other people
who did that,

03:57.411 --> 03:58.847
and they all ended up
with yo-yos

03:58.890 --> 04:00.370
around their throats.
both: Necks.

04:00.414 --> 04:01.893
- Nope, I said "throats,"
not necks,

04:01.937 --> 04:04.548
which means I haven't told
that story too many times.

04:04.592 --> 04:07.290
All right, lace up
your dancing shoes

04:07.334 --> 04:11.468
because it's time to catch
this disco bastard.

04:11.512 --> 04:13.514
- Thank you for coming in,
Ms. Brennan.

04:13.557 --> 04:15.603
Can you describe your working
relationship with Mr. Haggerty?

04:15.646 --> 04:18.040
- Absolutely.
Seth hired me three years ago

04:18.083 --> 04:20.564
to help with large-scale
statistical arbitrage

04:20.608 --> 04:22.871
and ever since we've been
at a steady 18% yield.

04:22.914 --> 04:24.220
- I didn't know most
of those words,

04:24.264 --> 04:25.569
but I'm assuming it means
you're good at business.

04:25.613 --> 04:27.745
- I am good.
I brought in $168 million

04:27.789 --> 04:29.051
to the firm last quarter.

04:29.094 --> 04:30.574
- Wow, that's a lot of money.

04:30.618 --> 04:32.576
Where do you keep it all?
It's in a computer.

04:32.620 --> 04:33.969
I've watched
too much "DuckTales."

04:34.012 --> 04:35.753
- No, you can never watch
too much "DuckTales."

04:35.797 --> 04:37.755
It's my dream to have
a gold coin pool.

04:37.799 --> 04:39.540
- Like Scrooge McD. Continue.
- Look.

04:39.583 --> 04:41.542
I love my job,
and I'm really good at it.

04:41.585 --> 04:43.935
I would never do anything
to jeopardize what I have,

04:43.979 --> 04:45.720
and I'm not a violent person,

04:45.763 --> 04:47.765
but last night
Seth crossed a line.

04:47.809 --> 04:49.767
- Can you tell us
what happened?

04:49.811 --> 04:52.770
- I was working late, and
he called me into his office.

04:52.814 --> 04:54.337
He had clearly been drinking,

04:54.381 --> 04:55.860
and before I knew it,
he pushed me into a desk

04:55.904 --> 04:57.514
and he tried to
take my clothes off.

04:57.558 --> 04:59.299
So I grabbed
his stupid golf club

04:59.342 --> 05:00.604
and I hit him
in the Cookie Monster,

05:00.648 --> 05:02.345
which is what he calls
his penis, by the way.

05:02.389 --> 05:03.433
- Gross.
- He's the worst.

05:03.477 --> 05:04.956
My only regret is that
I didn't get

05:05.000 --> 05:07.002
in two extra whacks
for each of his testicles.

05:07.045 --> 05:08.351
- What does he call those?
Bert and Ernie?

05:08.395 --> 05:09.396
- You are actually correct.

05:09.439 --> 05:11.049
- Ugh, I hate
that I got that right.

05:11.093 --> 05:12.442
- So in conclusion:

05:12.486 --> 05:14.488
the burns on Zumowski's body
are consistent

05:14.531 --> 05:16.054
with a massive vehicle fire.

05:16.098 --> 05:18.709
- If this even is his body.
- Excuse me?

05:18.753 --> 05:20.929
- We're talking about
the Disco Strangler...

05:20.972 --> 05:22.974
a serial killer,
who for six years

05:23.018 --> 05:25.629
stayed one step ahead
of the entire NYPD.

05:25.673 --> 05:27.631
- Not sure he had many steps
left in him, sir.

05:27.675 --> 05:29.067
Take a look.
- Aw.

05:29.111 --> 05:31.896
He looks fragile and sweet.
- Sweet as poison pie.

05:31.940 --> 05:33.855
Were you able to match
the dental records

05:33.898 --> 05:36.118
to the Disco Strangler?
- No, the body had no teeth.

05:36.161 --> 05:37.815
- Well, that's suspicious.
- Not really.

05:37.859 --> 05:39.382
Zumowski didn't have
any teeth either.

05:39.426 --> 05:41.558
- Due to him being very old?
- Yes.

05:41.602 --> 05:44.474
- What about the fact that
this corpse is 71 inches tall

05:44.518 --> 05:46.607
when the Disco Strangler
was 76?

05:46.650 --> 05:47.825
- He shrank over time.

05:47.869 --> 05:49.000
- Is that another
old person thing?

05:49.044 --> 05:50.654
- Yes, it is.
Another old person thing.

05:50.698 --> 05:52.526
- Mm-hmm.
- We also have a DNA match

05:52.569 --> 05:53.701
between hair on the head

05:53.744 --> 05:55.006
of this body
and the Disco Strangler.

05:55.050 --> 05:56.660
- Sir, this is clearly
Zumowski.

05:56.704 --> 05:57.966
And that's a good thing.

05:58.009 --> 05:59.707
You can finally say good-bye
to your nemesis.

05:59.750 --> 06:01.012
- Thanks, sergeant.
That's a nice thought.

06:01.056 --> 06:02.884
For an idiot to have.
Look at this.

06:02.927 --> 06:04.102
- A dirty little string?

06:04.146 --> 06:05.669
- Oh, it's not just
any old string.

06:05.713 --> 06:08.411
It's a yo-yo string, the most
dangerous part of the yo-yo.

06:08.455 --> 06:09.891
The Strangler wanted me
to find this.

06:09.934 --> 06:13.416
He's out there,
and he's taunting me.

06:14.635 --> 06:16.593
- Okay, Ms. Brennan,
we've discussed it,

06:16.637 --> 06:18.421
and we think
you should file charges

06:18.465 --> 06:20.510
against Mr. Haggerty
for sexual assault.

06:20.554 --> 06:23.383
Now, I'm not gonna lie to you,
it's a difficult process...

06:23.426 --> 06:25.515
- Actually, I'm gonna stop you
right there.

06:25.559 --> 06:26.908
I don't wanna press charges.

06:26.951 --> 06:28.910
The firm just offered me
$2.5 million

06:28.953 --> 06:31.391
if I sign an NDA
and let this slide.

06:31.434 --> 06:33.654
- Wait, so you're gonna let
Seth get off scot-free?

06:33.697 --> 06:34.872
- Well, that money would go
a long way

06:34.916 --> 06:36.700
towards the Scrooge pool.
Sorry, ignore me.

06:36.744 --> 06:38.136
"DuckTales." Woo-oo.
- I mean, I think

06:38.180 --> 06:39.703
I have to take it.

06:39.747 --> 06:41.531
This is a "he said, she said,"
situation.

06:41.575 --> 06:43.098
I know how that goes down.

06:43.141 --> 06:45.666
No one's gonna convict him
on my word alone.

06:45.709 --> 06:47.798
The system's as broken
as Seth's dong.

06:47.842 --> 06:49.713
- No, it's not.
I'm the system.

06:49.757 --> 06:51.193
And I'm nothing like
Seth's dong.

06:51.236 --> 06:53.021
- It feels like we can move off
this analogy.

06:53.064 --> 06:54.979
- Just don't sign that NDA
right now.

06:55.023 --> 06:56.720
Give us a chance to bring
this guy to justice.

06:56.764 --> 06:58.026
- And how are you gonna
do that?

06:58.069 --> 06:59.723
- By working our asses off
to find proof

06:59.767 --> 07:01.508
that he assaulted you,
and when we do,

07:01.551 --> 07:03.161
he will go to jail
for what he did.

07:04.685 --> 07:06.426
I really think we can get him.

07:08.515 --> 07:11.126
- Okay.
Yeah, let's do this.

07:14.477 --> 07:16.653
- Oh, man, I'm reading
Keri's statement.

07:16.697 --> 07:18.263
If I was a woman,
I would not work in finance.

07:18.307 --> 07:21.092
- Oh, because it's so easy
for women everywhere else.

07:21.136 --> 07:22.659
- Okay, I can tell
that I am in trouble.

07:22.703 --> 07:23.834
- You're not in trouble.

07:23.878 --> 07:25.401
I just don't think
that men understand

07:25.445 --> 07:27.708
how different everything is
for us.

07:27.751 --> 07:29.666
I can think of a million
examples from this week alone.

07:29.710 --> 07:30.928
- Oh, sick!

07:30.972 --> 07:32.626
- Oh,
sick!

07:32.669 --> 07:34.018
- Have a great day.
- Oh, thanks.

07:34.062 --> 07:35.411
You too.
- Mm-hmm.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.935
You have a beautiful mouth.
Have a great day.

07:37.979 --> 07:39.589
- Excuse me, Miss,
do you know where

07:39.633 --> 07:41.112
I can find a police officer?

07:41.156 --> 07:43.027
Uh, sir, you're
a police officer, right?

07:43.071 --> 07:44.681
- Yeah, I'm a detective.
- Oh, thank God.

07:44.725 --> 07:46.074
- I'm in uniform!

07:46.117 --> 07:47.379
- Oh, that's why you
yelled that.

07:47.423 --> 07:48.729
I thought you were just excited

07:48.772 --> 07:50.252
about your general love
of uniforms.

07:50.295 --> 07:52.123
- Usually when I yell that,
it is because of my love

07:52.167 --> 07:54.430
of uniforms but not today.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.301
Today it was because
of that sexist jerk.

07:56.345 --> 07:59.827
- God, how many creeps have
I not noticed before... oh, no.

07:59.870 --> 08:01.829
The fruit seller guy on
our corner, is he a creep?

08:01.872 --> 08:04.309
- No, he's a real gentleman,
which is surprising

08:04.353 --> 08:06.311
because he's always holding
those two cantaloupes

08:06.355 --> 08:08.749
and the opportunity to be gross
is right there.

08:08.792 --> 08:10.141
- Is it? I've never even
noticed that before.

08:10.185 --> 08:12.230
I never wanted to make
a comment or anything

08:12.274 --> 08:14.842
- like that and thought better.
- Anyways.

08:14.885 --> 08:16.800
I am genuinely very sorry

08:16.844 --> 08:18.672
that this is something you have
to go through all the time.

08:18.715 --> 08:20.325
- It's okay.
I'm used to it.

08:20.369 --> 08:21.762
- That's even sadder.

08:21.805 --> 08:23.851
- I know.
But you know what's not sad?

08:23.894 --> 08:25.330
That Keri didn't take
that insane amount

08:25.374 --> 08:26.680
of hush money,
and now we get

08:26.723 --> 08:28.246
to put a bad guy in jail.
- Amen.

08:28.290 --> 08:29.987
- Wait, her firm offered her
a big deal and you told her

08:30.031 --> 08:31.119
not to take it?
- Yeah.

08:31.162 --> 08:32.337
Because that would mean letting

08:32.381 --> 08:33.643
a sexual assaulter go free.

08:33.687 --> 08:34.818
- Do you have
any physical evidence

08:34.861 --> 08:36.298
to prove that he did it?
- No.

08:36.341 --> 08:37.821
- So it sounds like he might
go free anyway.

08:37.865 --> 08:39.082
I mean, at least
if she takes the deal,

08:39.126 --> 08:40.345
she won't walk away
with nothing.

08:40.389 --> 08:41.738
- I'm surprised you feel
like that.

08:41.782 --> 08:42.957
You're such a feminist.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.131
- I feel like maybe
I shouldn't be here.

08:44.174 --> 08:45.437
- I am a feminist,
but I'm also a realist.

08:45.481 --> 08:46.743
I'm just looking out
for the victim.

08:46.787 --> 08:47.831
- Or should I be here
because men

08:47.875 --> 08:49.311
should be part
of the conversation?

08:49.354 --> 08:50.965
- Let's say best case scenario
you do find evidence.

08:51.008 --> 08:53.010
She's still gonna have to go
through a very public trial

08:53.054 --> 08:54.708
where they drag her name
through the mud.

08:54.751 --> 08:56.057
Even if she wins,
she still loses.

08:56.100 --> 08:57.362
It's two steps forward,
one step back.

08:57.406 --> 08:58.668
- I've landed
on active listening.

08:58.712 --> 08:59.930
I will no longer be chiming in.

08:59.974 --> 09:01.671
- Yeah, but when one person
comes forward,

09:01.715 --> 09:03.107
it inspires others to speak up.

09:03.151 --> 09:04.848
And that's a hell
of a lot better than taking

09:04.892 --> 09:06.807
a deal that lets
sexual predators walk free.

09:06.850 --> 09:08.460
- Dude, obviously, I get that.

09:08.504 --> 09:11.289
I'm just saying, remember that
there's a very real woman here

09:11.333 --> 09:13.161
whose career and life
are gonna be affected

09:13.204 --> 09:14.728
by you pursuing this case.

09:14.771 --> 09:17.078
I'm just saying,
consider what's best for her.

09:21.169 --> 09:23.911
- All right, the state police
is deploying 30 men

09:23.954 --> 09:26.174
and four helicopters to comb
the area of the accident.

09:26.217 --> 09:27.871
I felt comfortable saying

09:27.915 --> 09:32.223
this disco-man has danced
his last disco dance.

09:32.267 --> 09:35.313
- Sir, it's fun to see you
breaking out the old lingo,

09:35.357 --> 09:37.185
but do you think
you're jumping the gun?

09:37.228 --> 09:39.404
All the evidence points to
the Strangler being dead.

09:39.448 --> 09:41.189
- Not all the evidence.
- Right.

09:41.232 --> 09:44.279
The random piece of thread
you think is a yo-yo string.

09:44.322 --> 09:45.410
- It is a yo-yo string.

09:45.454 --> 09:47.325
The most dangerous part
of the yo-yo.

09:47.369 --> 09:48.936
- It just feels like you're
trying to relive

09:48.979 --> 09:50.894
your glory days.
- Absurd.

09:50.938 --> 09:53.070
- Well, what do you have
in that box over there?

09:53.114 --> 09:55.986
- Memories and keepsakes
of my greatest cases.

09:56.030 --> 09:58.467
Both: Mm-hmm.
- To remind me

09:58.510 --> 10:00.034
of the Strangler's MO.

10:00.077 --> 10:01.557
He always seduced an accomplice

10:01.601 --> 10:03.907
into doing
his fiendish bidding.

10:03.951 --> 10:05.735
I bet it was the van driver.

10:05.779 --> 10:07.389
- You mean the woman
who was thrown violently

10:07.432 --> 10:09.434
from the vehicle
and just barely survived?

10:09.478 --> 10:12.046
- Yeah, I'm sure she was very
"badly injured."

10:12.089 --> 10:14.352
- Sorry if my voice is raspy.

10:14.396 --> 10:16.267
They just took
the breathing tube out.

10:16.311 --> 10:18.443
- But they left the BS in?
- Good God.

10:18.487 --> 10:19.923
- Whoa.
- So, Ms. Park,

10:19.967 --> 10:22.447
it says in my file
that you drove Mr. Zumowski

10:22.491 --> 10:24.362
on multiple occasions.
- Yes.

10:24.406 --> 10:26.930
Because he had to go
to the hospital a lot.

10:26.974 --> 10:28.584
He was very, very old.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.281
- She's clearly been seduced.
- She has?

10:30.325 --> 10:32.283
- Let's cut the crap.
You helped him escape.

10:32.327 --> 10:33.458
You planted a cadaver
in the back.

10:33.502 --> 10:34.982
You flipped the van on purpose.

10:35.025 --> 10:36.461
Then the Strangler set it
on fire

10:36.505 --> 10:38.420
and sprinkled some
of his hair nearby

10:38.463 --> 10:39.943
so there'd be a DNA match.

10:39.987 --> 10:41.945
Then he left behind
his calling card:

10:41.989 --> 10:43.991
this yo-yo string!

10:44.034 --> 10:46.080
- That's not a yo-yo string.
- What?

10:46.123 --> 10:48.822
- That's part of the lanyard
we give to the older inmates

10:48.865 --> 10:51.259
when they become fall risks.
- You're lying.

10:51.302 --> 10:53.174
You've succumbed
to his groovy voodoo!

10:53.217 --> 10:54.784
- Sir, I don't think
she's lying.

10:54.828 --> 10:56.090
Look at this photo
from the file.

10:56.133 --> 10:57.439
- Oh, my goodness.

10:57.482 --> 11:00.834
So this string
is just a string?

11:00.877 --> 11:02.618
The DNA was really a match?

11:02.662 --> 11:05.577
The Disco Strangler
is actually dead.

11:05.621 --> 11:10.539
And that chapter of my life
is forever closed.

11:10.582 --> 11:13.585
Well, that's...

11:13.629 --> 11:16.023
fantastic news.

11:16.066 --> 11:17.807
- Okay, we have you
set up here.

11:17.851 --> 11:19.461
We have a VR experience
down the hall

11:19.504 --> 11:21.550
where you can fly like a bird,
and if you need anything else

11:21.593 --> 11:24.422
just buzz and one
of our butlers will assist you.

11:24.466 --> 11:27.512
- This place is amazing.
It's like a dream factory.

11:27.556 --> 11:28.949
- We're investigating
a sexual assault

11:28.992 --> 11:30.037
that occurred in these offices.

11:30.080 --> 11:31.342
- Right, of course.
I know.

11:31.386 --> 11:33.170
This is how people get tempted
by the devil.

11:33.214 --> 11:35.390
I see what you're up to,
platter of tiny quiches.

11:35.433 --> 11:38.001
- We need to get
someone on the record

11:38.045 --> 11:39.481
about Seth's
patterned behaviors.

11:39.524 --> 11:41.526
I think if we start with...

11:41.570 --> 11:43.354
How many tiny quiches
do you have in your mouth?

11:43.398 --> 11:45.356
- Five.
I'll swallow them.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.271
Let's just start
the interviews.

11:47.315 --> 11:49.317
- I don't think something like
that would happen here.

11:49.360 --> 11:51.014
It's an extremely professional
workplace,

11:51.058 --> 11:52.494
and Seth's a really good guy.

11:52.537 --> 11:54.409
I don't think he's even ever
bought a prostitute before.

11:54.452 --> 11:55.932
- Is that the minimum
requirement for being

11:55.976 --> 11:57.891
a good guy these days?
- Can I go?

11:57.934 --> 12:00.067
Beefer's birthday's starting
and a bunch of Mets are here.

12:00.110 --> 12:01.329
- Present day or '86?

12:01.372 --> 12:03.331
- Both.
- I'm gonna escort him back.

12:03.374 --> 12:04.593
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

12:04.636 --> 12:06.334
Seth has never been
inappropriate with me.

12:06.377 --> 12:07.901
He's a really good guy.

12:07.944 --> 12:09.903
Honestly, this is an extremely
professional workplace.

12:09.946 --> 12:12.122
- Dude, Beefer just puked in
the koi pond.

12:12.166 --> 12:14.951
Oh, sorry, I didn't realize
the cop thing was in here.

12:14.995 --> 12:17.084
This is an extremely
professional workplace,

12:17.127 --> 12:18.607
and Seth is a really good guy.

12:18.650 --> 12:21.349
- Hey, I'm Beefer.
It's my birthday.

12:21.392 --> 12:23.003
- Yeah, we heard.
- Happy Birthday, Beefer.

12:23.046 --> 12:24.569
- Beefer's not my real name.

12:24.613 --> 12:26.528
They just call me that 'cause
I beefed on my first day.

12:26.571 --> 12:28.008
- Okay, but for the record,
no one asked.

12:28.051 --> 12:30.053
- I don't have anything bad
to say about Seth.

12:30.097 --> 12:31.489
He's a really good guy,

12:31.533 --> 12:34.231
and this office is...
what's the word?

12:34.275 --> 12:36.581
Both: Extremely professional.
- Yes!

12:36.625 --> 12:39.236
- Hello, Sergeant Santiago
and Detective Peralta.

12:39.280 --> 12:41.673
I'm the Deputy General Counsel
here at the firm.

12:41.717 --> 12:43.501
I can only assume
your questioning has revealed

12:43.545 --> 12:45.634
nothing negative
about Mr. Haggerty's character.

12:45.677 --> 12:47.244
- Only because you told them
exactly what to say.

12:47.288 --> 12:48.637
- We did no such thing.

12:48.680 --> 12:51.118
These allegations of
sexual assault are ridiculous.

12:51.161 --> 12:53.294
- If they're so ridiculous,
then why offer Keri Brennan

12:53.337 --> 12:54.730
hush money?
- That wasn't hush money.

12:54.774 --> 12:57.472
That was a benevolent gesture
to allow Ms. Brennan

12:57.515 --> 12:59.343
to get the professional help
she so clearly needs.

12:59.387 --> 13:01.693
However, since she has chosen
to pursue this matter

13:01.737 --> 13:04.479
with the police, that deal
is now null and void.

13:04.522 --> 13:06.133
Furthermore,
we are terminating her.

13:06.176 --> 13:07.438
Both: What?
- We have a zero

13:07.482 --> 13:09.179
tolerance policy
for violence here.

13:09.223 --> 13:10.572
And unlike Ms. Brennan,

13:10.615 --> 13:12.617
Mr. Haggerty has actual
evidence of an assault.

13:12.661 --> 13:14.924
- He's talking
about my broken penis.

13:14.968 --> 13:16.621
- Yeah, Seth, we know.

13:19.146 --> 13:21.061
- Hey, you never came home
last night.

13:21.104 --> 13:22.323
You doing okay?
- No, I'm a mess.

13:22.366 --> 13:23.628
I miss Hitchcock.
- What?

13:23.672 --> 13:25.369
I was obviously talking to Amy.

13:25.413 --> 13:26.849
- Oh, and who's talking
to Scully?

13:26.893 --> 13:29.678
No one.
Come on, sandwich.

13:29.721 --> 13:31.767
- Ames, you've been working
yourself to the bone

13:31.811 --> 13:33.725
on this case
for three days straight.

13:33.769 --> 13:35.597
Now, I'm starting to worry
about you.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.599
- I have to solve this case,
Jake.

13:37.642 --> 13:39.514
Otherwise Keri lost
the settlement

13:39.557 --> 13:41.777
and the job that she loves
because of me,

13:41.821 --> 13:43.344
just like Rosa said.

13:45.041 --> 13:46.695
But I can't find anything.

13:46.738 --> 13:48.784
I've read through three years
of Seth's emails,

13:48.828 --> 13:51.700
and it's mostly inquiries about
where he could buy a Batmobile.

13:51.743 --> 13:53.702
- Tah, so stupid,
but did he find one?

13:53.745 --> 13:55.878
Is it like at a dealership
or something? Never mind.

13:55.922 --> 13:59.403
Look, I know this sucks,
and I hate to say it,

13:59.447 --> 14:01.101
but we both know
sometimes you work a case

14:01.144 --> 14:02.711
and you just don't
have the evidence.

14:02.754 --> 14:05.845
- This isn't just a case
for me.

14:07.759 --> 14:09.500
When I was a rookie
at the Six-Four,

14:09.544 --> 14:11.720
my captain was my first mentor.

14:11.763 --> 14:13.417
He helped me get
on the detective track,

14:13.461 --> 14:16.551
and he gave me
all the best cases.

14:16.594 --> 14:19.946
But when I finally
made detective,

14:19.989 --> 14:22.687
he took me to dinner
and tried to kiss me.

14:22.731 --> 14:26.126
He said that he felt like
he deserved something

14:26.169 --> 14:28.955
in return for my career.

14:28.998 --> 14:30.391
I just

14:30.434 --> 14:33.524
ran out of the restaurant
back to the office,

14:33.568 --> 14:36.005
and I put in my transfer
for the Nine-Nine.

14:36.049 --> 14:37.702
- Oh, man.

14:39.530 --> 14:41.532
I'm so sorry.

14:42.229 --> 14:45.754
- I never told anyone
because I felt like

14:45.797 --> 14:48.191
maybe I didn't actually deserve
my promotion.

14:48.235 --> 14:51.455
And I worried that I wouldn't
get anymore promotions

14:51.499 --> 14:53.762
if I spoke up, so...

14:53.805 --> 14:55.459
- God.

14:56.460 --> 14:58.419
Every time I think I understand
how bad it is,

14:58.462 --> 15:00.508
it's just way worse
than I imagined.

15:00.551 --> 15:01.944
- This kind of stuff
has happened

15:01.988 --> 15:05.469
to literally
every woman I know.

15:05.513 --> 15:08.820
I just wanted to help make it
better for this one woman.

15:14.522 --> 15:16.959
- Okay.
- Wait, where are you going?

15:17.003 --> 15:19.135
- I'm gonna go get you a change
of clothes and a coffee.

15:19.179 --> 15:21.137
We're not giving up.

15:21.181 --> 15:23.052
- Okay.

15:23.096 --> 15:24.924
Hey, what if we reach out

15:24.967 --> 15:26.969
to all the coworkers again,
privately?

15:27.013 --> 15:28.231
Maybe they didn't talk to us

15:28.275 --> 15:29.841
because we interviewed them
in their office.

15:29.885 --> 15:31.713
- I think that's a great idea.
I'll be right back.

15:31.756 --> 15:33.541
Oh, I'm also gonna grab a comb,

15:33.584 --> 15:36.152
but you don't have to use it
unless you decide.

15:36.196 --> 15:37.980
- Okay, babe.

15:38.024 --> 15:39.634
- Sir,

15:39.677 --> 15:41.505
you haven't come out
of your office in a while.

15:41.549 --> 15:43.812
How are you doing?
- Terrible. You were right.

15:43.855 --> 15:46.858
I was trying
to relive my glory years,

15:46.902 --> 15:49.470
but the fact remains,
they are behind me.

15:49.513 --> 15:51.994
My only nemesis now...

15:52.038 --> 15:54.692
Father Time.

15:54.736 --> 15:56.694
- Come on, sir.
That's ridiculous.

15:56.738 --> 15:58.044
You're on the cutting edge.

15:58.087 --> 15:59.349
In fact, you're so progressive,

15:59.393 --> 16:01.047
they were scared to make you
Police Commissioner.

16:01.090 --> 16:03.005
You're as modern as they come.

16:03.049 --> 16:04.615
What is that noise?

16:04.659 --> 16:06.748
It's my fax machine.
- Oh, Captain.

16:08.532 --> 16:11.274
- Zowie. I'm young!
- What is it?

16:11.318 --> 16:13.494
- It's an aerial photograph
from one of the helicopters

16:13.537 --> 16:15.931
I had deployed.
Take a gander, boys.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.151
It's him.
The Disco Strangler.

16:18.194 --> 16:20.109
- Oh, my God.
You were right.

16:20.153 --> 16:22.720
- Of course I was.
I know him better than anyone.

16:22.764 --> 16:25.027
We're two sides of the same...
all: Coin!

16:25.071 --> 16:26.724
- You've told us this story
many times.

16:26.768 --> 16:28.813
- And you'll hear it again!

16:28.857 --> 16:31.033
- So we're meeting a guy
named Steve.

16:31.077 --> 16:32.904
He said he couldn't speak
openly with us

16:32.948 --> 16:34.558
when we met him
in the conference room.

16:34.602 --> 16:36.125
- Steve?
I don't remember a Steve.

16:36.169 --> 16:37.909
Who's Steve?
- I am.

16:37.953 --> 16:39.737
Both: Beefer?

16:39.781 --> 16:41.870
So your real name is Steve?
- Yeah, I hate it.

16:41.913 --> 16:43.915
Makes me sound like a douche.
- Yeah, Beefer's better.

16:43.959 --> 16:45.613
- So why'd you agree
to meet with us?

16:45.656 --> 16:47.702
- I wanted to show you
this text chain between Seth

16:47.745 --> 16:50.661
and some of the guys
in the office.

16:50.705 --> 16:54.187
- Whoa, Seth describes the
night exactly like Keri did.

16:54.230 --> 16:56.537
And then he writes
"LOLZ, Epic Fail."

16:56.580 --> 16:58.191
What's this GIF he sent?

16:58.234 --> 17:00.628
- Oh, that's Kelsey Grammer
falling off a stage.

17:00.671 --> 17:02.543
I was really torn

17:02.586 --> 17:04.284
about whether or not
I should send this to you guys

17:04.327 --> 17:06.068
but then I thought about it
for a long time

17:06.112 --> 17:08.243
and realized it was
the right thing to do.

17:08.288 --> 17:10.768
- Oh, who would have guessed
Beefer's a secret feminist.

17:10.811 --> 17:13.249
- No, gross. I meant it was
the right thing to do for me.

17:13.292 --> 17:14.642
- Huh?
- If they fire Seth,

17:14.685 --> 17:16.209
I take his job.
- Okay.

17:16.252 --> 17:17.732
Well, we got
what we needed here.

17:17.775 --> 17:18.906
So I think we're gonna leave

17:18.950 --> 17:20.213
before you ruin the moment
any further.

17:20.256 --> 17:21.300
- Sweet. I'll send it to ya.

17:21.344 --> 17:22.867
Thanks for the promosh, narks.

17:22.911 --> 17:25.740
- You're the nark.

17:27.220 --> 17:29.048
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

17:30.136 --> 17:31.963
- All right, people,
your suspect's name

17:32.007 --> 17:36.272
is Ernest Zumowski, better
known as the Disco Strangler.

17:36.316 --> 17:38.013
Take a close look.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.015
This is the most dangerous man
in America.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.583
5'8", hunched over, 93 pounds

17:42.626 --> 17:44.280
with gray hair
and blue-gray skin.

17:44.324 --> 17:46.587
If you encounter him,
keep your distance.

17:46.630 --> 17:48.371
- All due respect, sir,
seems like a lot of manpower

17:48.415 --> 17:49.894
to take down
one sweet-looking old man.

17:49.938 --> 17:52.114
- Oh, he's sweet, all right.
Sweet as poison pie.

17:52.158 --> 17:53.942
- Yeah,
don't underestimate him!

17:53.985 --> 17:55.683
I know 28 other people
who did that,

17:55.726 --> 17:58.077
and they all have yo-yos
swinging from their throats.

17:58.120 --> 17:59.904
- So you were listening.
- Yeah, we were saying that

17:59.948 --> 18:01.602
all along.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

18:01.645 --> 18:03.343
All right, troops.
Travel in twos.

18:03.386 --> 18:06.389
Keep your eyes open,
and for God's sake,

18:06.433 --> 18:08.043
protect the neck.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.784
- Hey, Keri.

18:09.827 --> 18:12.395
Great news: the DA's going to
press charges against Haggerty.

18:12.439 --> 18:15.050
- I heard. That's awesome.
Thank you, guys.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.835
- Hey, what's with the boxes?
Moving to a better desk?

18:17.879 --> 18:20.011
- With a better butler and
more of those mini quiches?

18:20.055 --> 18:23.014
- No, I'm taking my stuff home.
I had to quit.

18:23.058 --> 18:27.149
Both: Whaaat?

18:29.717 --> 18:32.154
- What do you mean, you quit?
Are they forcing you out?

18:32.198 --> 18:33.503
Because that's illegal.
- No, they're not.

18:33.547 --> 18:35.201
But the whole atmosphere
here has changed.

18:35.244 --> 18:37.768
Everybody looks at me like I'm
either a victim or a trader.

18:37.812 --> 18:41.032
I mean, I'm not even on any
of the non-work group texts.

18:41.076 --> 18:43.122
And last night Beefer invited
everybody over

18:43.165 --> 18:45.341
for whiskey and cigars,
and I wasn't included.

18:45.385 --> 18:47.169
- Well, I mean,
is not hanging out

18:47.213 --> 18:49.650
with Beefer really
a punishment, per se?

18:49.693 --> 18:51.217
- Yeah, but if I'm not
at Beefer's

18:51.260 --> 18:53.175
for whiskey and cigars,
then I don't get invited

18:53.219 --> 18:54.698
to Vegas with Slurpie
and Trundle,

18:54.742 --> 18:56.744
and I'm definitely not
at Skidmark's pig roast.

18:56.787 --> 18:58.398
- Man, these nicknames
are just bad.

18:58.441 --> 18:59.703
- I actually came up
with Skidmark.

18:59.747 --> 19:01.531
It's very funny
if you know the back story.

19:01.575 --> 19:03.316
- He pooped his pants?
- Yeah.

19:03.359 --> 19:05.579
But the point is,
if I'm not at those events,

19:05.622 --> 19:08.190
then suddenly I'm not looked
at for new accounts

19:08.234 --> 19:11.628
or promotions or anything.
My career here is over.

19:11.672 --> 19:13.717
- I'm really sorry.
I feel like a messed up.

19:13.761 --> 19:15.371
I shouldn't have talked you
into turning down

19:15.415 --> 19:18.157
that settlement.
- Hey, Seth attacked me.

19:18.200 --> 19:19.767
And I'm really proud of myself

19:19.810 --> 19:21.508
that I didn't let him
get away with that.

19:21.551 --> 19:24.380
So, even though it sucks,
if I had to do it all again,

19:24.424 --> 19:26.252
I would.

19:26.295 --> 19:29.429
Especially the broken penis.

19:29.472 --> 19:32.562
- Why'd she say that to me?
- I don't know.

19:37.524 --> 19:40.483
- Freeze! NYPD!

19:40.527 --> 19:42.224
- Is that Raymond Holt I see?

19:42.268 --> 19:43.573
You haven't changed a bit.

19:43.617 --> 19:46.097
- Neither have you, Ernest.
- What?

19:46.141 --> 19:48.491
- Neither have you,
Ernest.

19:48.535 --> 19:49.753
- What?

19:49.797 --> 19:53.453
Neither have you, Ernest!

19:53.496 --> 19:55.237
- Ugh, this is hard to watch.

19:55.281 --> 19:57.239
- You're just as devious
as ever.

19:57.283 --> 19:58.762
You seduced the van driver,
didn't you?

19:58.806 --> 20:00.590
- No, I seduced the van driver.

20:00.634 --> 20:03.245
She couldn't resist
my groovy voodoo.

20:03.289 --> 20:06.161
- And the yo-yo string
was a message.

20:06.205 --> 20:10.165
- The what was a what?
- The yo-yo string was...

20:10.209 --> 20:11.297
- Captain, this is
embarrassing.

20:11.340 --> 20:12.863
Can we just take him in?

20:12.907 --> 20:15.344
- Yeah, you're right.
This isn't what I hoped for.

20:15.388 --> 20:17.259
Go ahead and cuff him, gently.

20:17.303 --> 20:19.653
- This isn't the last you'll
hear from me, Raymond.

20:19.696 --> 20:21.568
I'm never gonna die.
- Sure you won't.

20:21.611 --> 20:24.179
Whatever makes you feel better.
- No, you're the punk.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.876
- Just put him in the car.

20:28.139 --> 20:29.837
- Hey, heard you guys got
that finance creep.

20:29.880 --> 20:31.360
Congratulations.
- Thanks.

20:31.404 --> 20:32.883
But there's nothing
to congratulate me about.

20:32.927 --> 20:35.538
- Amy's just upset because
the historically entrenched

20:35.582 --> 20:37.627
patriarchy has created
a culture of victim-shaming

20:37.671 --> 20:40.674
that suppresses any power shift
in our masculo-phallic system.

20:40.717 --> 20:42.153
- Huh?
- I couldn't sleep last night

20:42.197 --> 20:43.894
so I watched a documentary
on Netflix about feminism.

20:43.938 --> 20:45.374
- I love you.

20:45.418 --> 20:47.681
Just sucks that she came
forward to report an assault

20:47.724 --> 20:49.291
and the only one
who truly benefited

20:49.335 --> 20:51.467
is a guy named Beefer.
- You don't know Beefer but...

20:51.511 --> 20:52.860
- Oh, I've met plenty
of Beefers.

20:52.903 --> 20:54.253
- Yeah.
- Look this is a hard fight.

20:54.296 --> 20:55.602
But it's an important one.

20:55.645 --> 20:56.907
It's good that you convinced
her to press charges.

20:56.951 --> 20:58.387
- But she lost the money,
and she had to quit

20:58.431 --> 20:59.606
the job she loves.

20:59.649 --> 21:01.216
That's exactly what you
said would happen.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.305
- But you got the guy
who assaulted her.

21:03.349 --> 21:04.872
And look over there.

21:04.915 --> 21:07.527
- Keri's coworker?
- She came forward to report

21:07.570 --> 21:09.224
an assault because she was
inspired by Keri,

21:09.268 --> 21:10.878
which is exactly
what you said would happen.

21:10.921 --> 21:14.838
Two steps forward, one step
back is still one step forward.

21:14.882 --> 21:17.580
You wanna take
her statement together?

21:17.624 --> 21:20.714
- You know it, sister.
- Yeah, don't do that.

21:20.757 --> 21:22.803
- We can be different
and still have the same cause.

21:24.761 --> 21:26.807
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.
