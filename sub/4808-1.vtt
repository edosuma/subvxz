03:14.060 --> 03:15.510
Are you crazy?

03:15.560 --> 03:17.320
You'll wake up
the whole neighborhood.

03:17.350 --> 03:19.180
- Hi, Mom.
- Don't "Hi, Mom" me.

03:19.210 --> 03:20.670
What are you still doing up?
It's past 1:00.

03:20.710 --> 03:24.510
- I thought I'd wait for you.
- Well, I'm home.

03:24.550 --> 03:26.410
Now you can get to sleep.
Come on.

03:26.440 --> 03:27.550
Andale.

03:29.160 --> 03:30.980
I'm really not tired.

03:31.010 --> 03:33.670
Kristen, don't start with me.
You know what your shrink said.

03:33.710 --> 03:35.260
He's full of it.

03:35.310 --> 03:36.900
I'm not going to let you
get me into an argument.

03:36.940 --> 03:38.440
Now get to sleep.

03:38.470 --> 03:43.560
Mom, I'm still having
those awful dreams.

03:43.600 --> 03:45.760
Elaine,
where do you keep the bourbon?

03:46.760 --> 03:49.930
I'll be right down.
I've got a guest.

03:49.960 --> 03:51.970
And you don't want
to keep him waiting?

03:52.010 --> 03:53.760
That's right. I don't.

03:56.270 --> 03:57.380
Good night.

04:45.770 --> 04:50.080
One, two,
Freddy's coming for you

04:50.130 --> 04:54.410
Three, four,
better lock your door

04:54.440 --> 04:58.890
Five, six, grab a crucifix

04:58.920 --> 05:03.590
Seven, eight, gonna stay up late

05:03.630 --> 05:08.100
Nine, ten, never sleep again

05:08.140 --> 05:12.400
One, two,
Freddy's coming for you

05:12.430 --> 05:15.980
Three, four,
better lock your door

05:16.010 --> 05:19.950
Five, six, grab a crucifix

05:19.990 --> 05:24.680
Seven, eight, gonna stay up late

05:24.720 --> 05:26.890
Nine, ten...

05:38.450 --> 05:40.840
Hi. What's your name?

05:40.880 --> 05:43.820
Kristen. What's yours?

05:46.320 --> 05:48.230
What is this place?

05:50.390 --> 05:52.810
I got to go now.

05:53.910 --> 05:55.570
Wait, little girl.
Don't go in there!

05:57.390 --> 05:59.430
Little girl?

06:40.120 --> 06:42.830
This is where he takes us.

06:43.830 --> 06:44.780
Come on. We're going.

06:55.670 --> 06:57.320
Freddy's home.

07:56.920 --> 07:59.190
Put me down. You're hurting me.

09:11.870 --> 09:14.550
And in local news, two more
teenage deaths have occurred...

09:14.590 --> 09:15.770
both suicides.

09:15.810 --> 09:17.750
County health officials
are at a loss to explain...

09:17.790 --> 09:19.770
this alarming trend.

09:19.810 --> 09:23.390
Nothing like a little
cheery news to start the day.

09:23.420 --> 09:27.220
Doc, I got a new theory
about all these suicides.

09:27.260 --> 09:30.110
Don't hold back on us, Max.
We need all the help we can get.

09:30.150 --> 09:32.450
It's fucked-up chromosomes.
Think about it.

09:32.480 --> 09:34.930
All their parents dropped acid
during the sixties.

09:34.970 --> 09:36.380
It beats Simms' theory.

09:36.420 --> 09:38.930
She thinks it's sex,
drugs, and rock 'n' roll.

09:38.970 --> 09:41.460
Shit.
That's what keeps people alive.

09:42.430 --> 09:44.280
Hi, Taryn.

09:44.320 --> 09:46.900
You don't look so hot, kid.
Are you getting some sleep?

09:48.540 --> 09:49.630
I didn't think so.

09:49.670 --> 09:50.750
Good morning, Dr. Gordon.

09:50.790 --> 09:52.570
Good morning, Jennifer.
How are the burns?

09:52.610 --> 09:54.170
Regular, menthol, ultra-light.

09:54.210 --> 09:55.610
They're healing up nicely.

09:55.650 --> 09:59.450
I've been good. When do I get
my cigarette privileges back?

09:59.490 --> 10:01.460
Don't hold your breath.

10:02.180 --> 10:04.250
- Phillip.
- Hey, Doc.

10:13.570 --> 10:14.810
How is he?

10:14.850 --> 10:16.280
He's cooling down.

10:16.320 --> 10:18.180
If he continues having
these outbursts...

10:18.210 --> 10:20.390
I'll have to have him
isolated permanently.

10:20.410 --> 10:21.910
Don't worry.
It won't come to that.

10:23.010 --> 10:25.980
I read the report
on the new staff member.

10:26.010 --> 10:27.480
What did you think?

10:27.520 --> 10:31.300
I don't understand why
some grad school superstar...

10:31.330 --> 10:33.750
is being treated
like a seasoned pro.

10:33.790 --> 10:36.380
She's doing ground-breaking
research on pattern nightmares.

10:36.420 --> 10:40.220
We don't need any outside help.
I know these kids.

10:40.260 --> 10:43.160
I don't want some hotshot
taking chances with them...

10:43.200 --> 10:44.830
just so she can get published.

10:44.870 --> 10:47.810
Dr. Gordon, Dr. Simms,
to examination, stat.

10:50.570 --> 10:53.020
This is ridiculous.
I know my daughter.

10:53.060 --> 10:54.790
She's just trying
to get some attention.

10:54.820 --> 10:56.570
I won't play one of her
little games with her.

10:56.610 --> 10:59.130
Suicide attempt.
Just down from Country General.

10:59.170 --> 11:00.510
- What's her name?
- Kristen Parker.

11:00.550 --> 11:03.060
She was fine
until we tried sedating her.

11:07.110 --> 11:08.700
She tore her stitches out.

11:08.740 --> 11:11.290
Kristen, we want to help you!

11:12.360 --> 11:13.540
Hold her.

11:18.210 --> 11:21.000
I'm Dr. Gordon.
I want to help you.

11:24.190 --> 11:25.920
Be careful, Max!

11:26.790 --> 11:28.190
Back off, Max.

11:28.230 --> 11:31.260
Kristen, put the scalpel down.

11:31.300 --> 11:33.510
Nobody's going to hurt you.

11:36.680 --> 11:40.640
Five, six, grab your crucifix

11:41.710 --> 11:46.370
Seven, eight,
better stay up late

11:46.720 --> 11:51.430
Nine, ten, never, never...

11:51.460 --> 11:52.840
Never sleep again.

12:00.010 --> 12:02.050
Where did you learn that rhyme?

12:15.020 --> 12:16.540
Tell me about the kids.

12:17.700 --> 12:21.350
Well, they're survivors
in a way.

12:21.390 --> 12:23.330
They're all severely
sleep disordered...

12:23.370 --> 12:25.850
insomnia, narcolepsy,
bed-wetting.

12:25.900 --> 12:27.660
But the nightmares
are their common thread?

12:27.690 --> 12:30.410
Right.
They share a group delusion...

12:30.440 --> 12:32.870
a boogieman,
for lack of a better word.

12:32.900 --> 12:34.500
They're so traumatized...

12:34.530 --> 12:36.580
they'll do almost anything
not to sleep.

12:36.620 --> 12:38.000
Anything?

12:40.520 --> 12:43.680
We lost a kid a month ago
to Fairview.

12:43.720 --> 12:45.610
I don't know where
he got the razors...

12:45.640 --> 12:47.270
but he cut off his own eyelids
to stay awake.

12:47.310 --> 12:48.970
Oh, God.

12:49.010 --> 12:50.860
Shook the kids up pretty badly.

12:51.660 --> 12:54.820
By the way, that was great work
with the new patient.

12:54.860 --> 12:56.170
Pretty smooth for an intern.

12:56.200 --> 12:59.200
I have had some experience
with pattern nightmares.

13:00.620 --> 13:02.190
I've got to get going.

13:03.760 --> 13:05.610
Let me help you.

13:08.690 --> 13:10.280
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

13:12.590 --> 13:15.370
Now, be sure
that you check in with Max.

13:15.400 --> 13:17.540
He'll give you
the whole twenty-five-cent tour.

13:18.440 --> 13:20.460
I'll see you later.

13:20.490 --> 13:21.900
Oh, Miss Thompson...

13:21.930 --> 13:23.020
You can call me Nancy.

13:23.950 --> 13:25.160
You call me Neil.

13:25.190 --> 13:28.510
What was that nursery rhyme
all about?

13:28.560 --> 13:31.340
It was just something
that the kids say...

13:31.370 --> 13:34.250
to keep the... boogieman away.

13:57.900 --> 13:59.050
Anyway, that's group therapy.

13:59.440 --> 14:02.060
This whole wing
is devoted to the program.

14:04.170 --> 14:05.490
I guess... yeah.

14:05.520 --> 14:07.880
You can use this office
for the time being.

14:07.920 --> 14:09.420
This will be fine.

14:10.100 --> 14:12.040
I'll have you set up
in your own space...

14:12.080 --> 14:13.840
by the end of the week.

14:13.870 --> 14:16.010
The patients' rooms
are down this way.

14:21.170 --> 14:24.400
This is Phillip.
We call him "The Walker."

14:24.440 --> 14:27.280
- Why is that?
- Because I sleepwalk.

14:27.310 --> 14:29.730
A perfectly normal event
that our illustrious staff...

14:29.780 --> 14:32.360
loves to theorize about
endlessly.

14:32.400 --> 14:33.960
Phillip, this is Nancy.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.160
Hi. Welcome to the snake pit.

14:38.330 --> 14:39.330
Thanks.

14:40.910 --> 14:42.160
Nice work.

14:42.190 --> 14:43.850
They really ought to be carved
out of wood...

14:43.890 --> 14:45.550
but they won't let me have
a knife.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.740
I might, you know...

14:53.430 --> 14:57.080
This lump over here is Kincaid.
Take a good look.

14:57.780 --> 15:00.270
He gets himself thrown in
the quiet room so often...

15:00.310 --> 15:02.720
you probably won't see
a lot of him.

15:02.770 --> 15:07.510
I do it so I don't have to look
at your ugly face all the time.

15:07.540 --> 15:08.880
I love you, too.

15:08.920 --> 15:10.130
Nice meeting you.

15:14.030 --> 15:16.940
They're really good kids,
but don't let them fool you.

15:16.980 --> 15:20.140
They're dangerous...
to themselves and to each other.

15:27.770 --> 15:28.910
Hi, Joey.

15:31.290 --> 15:32.950
Why, thank you.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.980
- Hey, Marcie. How you doing?
- Great.

15:36.020 --> 15:39.080
These going to "C" Ward?
I'll walk you down.

15:40.020 --> 15:41.580
See you later, Joey.

15:49.720 --> 15:52.430
Mrs. Parker, was Kristen
acting any different?

15:52.890 --> 15:56.340
Did you notice anything strange
before she made the attempt?

15:56.380 --> 15:58.410
Kristen specializes
in strangeness.

15:58.460 --> 16:00.790
I've spent thousands
on psychiatrists.

16:02.490 --> 16:04.380
Did she always have nightmares?

16:04.400 --> 16:07.220
No. They've gotten worse since
I took away her credit cards.

16:08.280 --> 16:09.690
I'm serious.

16:09.720 --> 16:11.660
I don't know
what you want from me.

16:11.700 --> 16:12.790
Just some answers.

16:12.830 --> 16:14.730
Other kids are involved,
not just Kristen.

16:14.770 --> 16:16.680
All good kids, smart kids.

16:16.730 --> 16:20.050
I'm sorry to hear that.
You're the experts, not me.

16:20.090 --> 16:21.780
If I had any insight
into any of this...

16:21.810 --> 16:23.760
I would share them with you,
believe me.

16:23.800 --> 16:25.210
I'm sure you would.

16:25.240 --> 16:27.150
Excuse me.
I have to get downtown.

16:27.190 --> 16:29.260
I'll need to get her things.

16:29.300 --> 16:32.650
I had them packed
in a suitcase. Teresa.

16:34.330 --> 16:36.950
I'll get them.
Please, I don't mind.

16:36.990 --> 16:39.570
It's the first door
at the top of the stairs.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.590
You.

21:31.630 --> 21:34.210
Oh, my God. Run!

21:36.660 --> 21:38.960
Get us back out, Kristen!
Do it now!

21:56.460 --> 21:58.020
I used to live in this house.

21:58.060 --> 21:59.950
That's just a house
I dream about.

21:59.980 --> 22:02.050
Have you ever done that
before...

22:02.090 --> 22:05.260
pulled someone into your dream?

22:05.290 --> 22:09.260
When I was a little girl,
like four or five...

22:09.290 --> 22:12.260
if I had a nightmare,
I'd always bring my dad in.

22:13.360 --> 22:14.790
The dreams
would always get better.

22:16.050 --> 22:18.430
He used to tell me about it
the next day.

22:18.920 --> 22:21.000
He used to think
they were his dreams.

22:21.810 --> 22:23.630
When did that stop?

22:24.590 --> 22:26.960
When I was still a kid.

22:26.990 --> 22:29.700
My folks got divorced,
and after a while...

22:29.740 --> 22:31.540
I just thought
I imagined the whole thing.

22:32.560 --> 22:34.250
I guess I didn't.

22:34.290 --> 22:36.230
It's an amazing gift.

22:37.230 --> 22:40.460
The man in my dreams,
he's real, isn't he?

22:44.460 --> 22:45.960
He's real.

22:47.150 --> 22:49.040
OK. Group's in session.

22:49.070 --> 22:51.340
Straight talk only in this room.

22:51.380 --> 22:54.160
Today I'd like to start
getting us acquainted...

22:54.190 --> 22:57.290
with our new staff member
Nancy Thompson.

22:57.330 --> 22:58.640
Let's make her welcome.

23:01.680 --> 23:03.370
You've already met
Phillip and Kincaid...

23:03.410 --> 23:04.720
and, of course, Kristen.

23:04.750 --> 23:08.650
How about the rest of you tell
Nancy about yourselves?

23:10.230 --> 23:13.090
Will, how about you first?

23:13.140 --> 23:15.310
Hi, I'm Will Stanton.

23:15.350 --> 23:17.970
I've had a little accident,
as you can see...

23:18.000 --> 23:19.660
ended up in this chair.

23:19.700 --> 23:23.530
Accident, my ass.
You said this was straight talk.

23:23.570 --> 23:27.500
So he took a jump. He wasn't
sticking needles in his arms.

23:27.540 --> 23:31.880
Save it, Kincaid. Jennifer?

23:31.920 --> 23:33.740
I'm Jennifer Callfield...

23:33.780 --> 23:35.920
and as soon as
I get out of here...

23:35.960 --> 23:38.580
I'm going to Los Angeles
to be an actress.

23:38.620 --> 23:40.720
I'm going to be on TV.

23:40.750 --> 23:43.540
Yeah. "Lifestyle
of the Rich and Psychotic."

23:43.570 --> 23:44.810
Screw you.

23:47.510 --> 23:50.030
This is Joey. He used to be
a debater in school.

23:50.070 --> 23:52.720
Now he doesn't talk much.

23:53.750 --> 23:55.180
I'm Taryn White.

23:55.220 --> 23:57.110
The only reason I'm in here...

23:57.140 --> 23:59.720
is because
it's better than juvie hall.

23:59.760 --> 24:02.830
Also because I'm going through
some very strange shit.

24:02.870 --> 24:04.590
Your dreams?

24:04.630 --> 24:07.150
Everybody has bad dreams.

24:07.190 --> 24:09.570
Can I interject something
just to save time?

24:09.620 --> 24:11.380
Sure, Phillip, go ahead.

24:11.420 --> 24:13.240
According to our kind hosts...

24:13.270 --> 24:15.570
our dreams
are a group psychosis...

24:15.610 --> 24:18.060
sort of a mellow mass hysteria.

24:18.100 --> 24:19.730
The fact that
we all dreamt about this guy...

24:19.770 --> 24:22.390
before we ever met
doesn't impress anybody.

24:23.870 --> 24:25.290
So we go in circles...

24:25.330 --> 24:28.020
making minimal progress
with maximum effort.

24:28.060 --> 24:29.360
You won't make any progress...

24:29.400 --> 24:32.250
until you recognize your dreams
for what they are.

24:32.280 --> 24:33.940
And what are they?

24:33.970 --> 24:36.110
The by-products of guilt.

24:36.150 --> 24:39.930
Psychological scars
stemming from moral conflicts...

24:39.960 --> 24:41.580
and overt sexuality.

24:41.620 --> 24:44.280
Oh, great.
It's my dick that's killing me.

24:50.040 --> 24:52.970
Tell me what's supposed
to be happening again.

24:53.010 --> 24:55.950
You're being attacked
by the bog demon.

24:57.200 --> 24:58.610
Fourteen.

24:58.650 --> 25:00.140
Doesn't count.
You got to say the words.

25:00.190 --> 25:03.510
- This is stupid.
- Come on.

25:06.870 --> 25:11.030
In the name of Lowrek,
Prince of Elves, demon begone.

25:11.930 --> 25:14.900
Good.
You conquered the demon...

25:14.940 --> 25:16.400
but your horse
is sinking in the bog.

25:16.440 --> 25:18.100
What do you do?

25:19.350 --> 25:23.280
I go to bed, and get a new horse
in the morning.

25:25.080 --> 25:27.800
How do I score that...
enchanted slumber or death?

25:29.330 --> 25:31.950
All right, fellas. Lights out.

25:31.990 --> 25:33.550
Aw, Max.

25:33.590 --> 25:35.480
'Aw, Max." You know the rules.

25:35.510 --> 25:37.460
Come on, Joey. You, too.

25:37.500 --> 25:39.800
Every time
we get a good game going...

25:39.840 --> 25:41.290
it's always, "Lights out."

25:51.810 --> 25:54.700
- Good night, fellas.
- Night, Max.

25:58.780 --> 26:00.250
OK, you get first shift.

26:01.270 --> 26:02.970
Oh, come on.
I had it last night.

26:04.410 --> 26:07.260
Good. Just remember,
keep your eyes open...

26:07.290 --> 26:10.870
and one whimper,
and you wake me up, OK?

26:24.730 --> 26:27.700
- This is nice.
- You never been here before?

26:27.740 --> 26:31.090
No. I think it opened
when I was at school.

26:31.140 --> 26:33.280
Best Thai food in Springwood.

26:33.310 --> 26:36.410
Of course, it's the only
Thai food in Springwood.

26:36.440 --> 26:38.810
Do your parents
still live around here?

26:40.510 --> 26:42.170
My mother passed away.

26:42.210 --> 26:44.630
She died in her sleep.

26:44.670 --> 26:46.130
I'm sorry.

26:47.010 --> 26:49.590
My father and I...

26:49.630 --> 26:52.930
Things just seemed
to fall apart after that.

26:52.960 --> 26:55.330
Sounds like a rough time.

26:55.360 --> 26:56.640
It was.

26:59.650 --> 27:03.510
What if I told you that...

27:03.560 --> 27:06.780
your patients
are in real physical danger...

27:06.820 --> 27:08.570
from their dreams?

27:08.610 --> 27:13.050
The nightmares are nothing but
a symptom of the real problems.

27:13.090 --> 27:17.150
Then let's just eliminate
the symptom for the time being.

27:17.180 --> 27:18.910
With Hypnocil?

27:20.290 --> 27:21.460
That's right.

27:21.500 --> 27:23.290
You want me to prescribe...

27:23.330 --> 27:25.120
an experimental
psychoactive drug...

27:25.150 --> 27:27.010
to a bunch
of suicidal teenagers?

27:27.040 --> 27:29.140
Just until we get things
under control.

27:29.180 --> 27:32.160
Dream deprivation is
nothing to fool with.

27:32.190 --> 27:34.270
You have no business
taking it yourself.

27:34.300 --> 27:35.870
I used to be like them.

27:35.910 --> 27:37.840
I know what
they're going through.

27:37.890 --> 27:39.200
So do I.

27:39.230 --> 27:43.970
You told me they were survivors,
and they are.

27:44.000 --> 27:47.100
But how much longer
they survive is up to us.

27:48.960 --> 27:50.780
I'm sorry, Nancy.

27:50.820 --> 27:53.030
The answer's no.

29:12.200 --> 29:13.340
Phillip, wake up.

29:17.870 --> 29:20.040
Have a nice stroll, asshole.

30:05.300 --> 30:07.680
What? What are you doing?

30:07.720 --> 30:09.150
Hey! Come on, man!

30:09.200 --> 30:10.820
What are you, crazy?

30:13.490 --> 30:15.310
Oh, shit! What's he doing?

30:16.270 --> 30:18.380
Get help! Get help!

30:32.360 --> 30:34.020
What's the matter?

30:38.730 --> 30:41.320
Don't do it, Phillip!

30:49.360 --> 30:50.820
God! Stop!

31:21.910 --> 31:24.240
I want us to talk
about last night.

31:24.270 --> 31:27.310
I want us to get our feelings
out in the open.

31:28.980 --> 31:32.170
He wasn't strong enough,
so he got wasted. That's all.

31:32.210 --> 31:34.800
That's all?
Is that what you think?

31:34.840 --> 31:37.390
He couldn't hack it,
so he got nailed. Period.

31:37.430 --> 31:41.620
Yeah. Big, tough badass.
How long will you last?

31:41.650 --> 31:43.340
Longer than any of you.

31:43.370 --> 31:46.220
Go ahead and fight.
That's what he wants.

31:46.260 --> 31:47.180
Who?

31:47.220 --> 31:49.450
Who do you think?
What does he want?

31:49.490 --> 31:53.030
To turn us against each other
so we'll be weak.

31:53.070 --> 31:54.930
- Horseshit.
- No, she's right.

31:54.960 --> 31:57.480
We're all
missing the point here.

31:57.520 --> 31:59.950
Phillip's death
was a sleepwalking accident.

31:59.980 --> 32:01.100
Nothing more.

32:01.140 --> 32:05.710
No. I could see him
up there... his face.

32:05.750 --> 32:09.830
He was wide awake...
all the way down.

32:09.870 --> 32:13.380
Then it was suicide.
Phillip quit. He gave up.

32:13.430 --> 32:14.670
Joey says it wasn't suicide.

32:14.710 --> 32:17.420
Listen to me, Joey.
Phillip killed himself.

32:17.460 --> 32:20.080
That's a cowardly thing.
That's an empty thing.

32:20.120 --> 32:22.250
He let himself down.
He let all of us down.

32:22.290 --> 32:25.160
It was murder!
Can't you understand that?

32:25.200 --> 32:27.470
That bastard murdered him!

32:27.510 --> 32:29.580
I'm not listening to this.

32:29.620 --> 32:32.270
How much longer will you go on
blaming your dreams...

32:32.310 --> 32:33.940
for your own weaknesses?

32:33.980 --> 32:37.680
How much longer will you keep
blowing smoke up our ass?

32:37.720 --> 32:39.660
There will be
no repeat occurrences...

32:39.700 --> 32:41.290
of last night's events.

32:41.330 --> 32:44.910
Your doors will be locked
during sleeping hours.

32:44.950 --> 32:47.880
We'll start a policy
of evening sedation.

32:47.920 --> 32:51.310
Anybody tries drugs on me
will get his ass kicked!

32:51.350 --> 32:54.100
You just bought yourself
a night in the quiet room!

32:54.140 --> 32:56.470
- Sit down!
- Fuck you! You sit down!

32:56.500 --> 32:57.650
Easy, Kincaid.

32:57.680 --> 33:01.650
Nobody's putting me to sleep!
Get away! Let me alone!

33:01.680 --> 33:04.070
Ain't nobody
putting me to sleep!

33:04.120 --> 33:06.740
I don't want to go to sleep!

33:06.780 --> 33:08.440
I ain't going to sleep!

33:08.470 --> 33:09.870
Stay in your seats.

33:11.030 --> 33:13.270
We'll begin sedation tonight,
starting with him.

33:13.300 --> 33:16.150
You can't.
They'll be defenseless.

33:16.190 --> 33:18.090
That's precisely
what they need...

33:18.130 --> 33:21.110
some uninterrupted REM sleep
to release that negative energy.

33:21.140 --> 33:23.830
I'm prescribing Hypnocil.

33:23.870 --> 33:25.040
It's a dream suppressant.

33:25.080 --> 33:28.790
I know what it is.
I just can't believe it.

33:28.830 --> 33:30.060
What has she talked you into?

33:30.100 --> 33:32.340
Nothing. It's my decision.

33:32.370 --> 33:35.240
I want these dreams stopped
till we get some answers.

33:35.290 --> 33:37.680
I can't allow that.

33:37.720 --> 33:39.410
Then I'll go to Carver
if I have to.

33:39.450 --> 33:42.130
He'll either back me up
or accept my resignation.

33:43.390 --> 33:46.170
All right.
But if something goes wrong...

33:46.200 --> 33:48.170
I'll make sure
that you're held responsible.

33:48.220 --> 33:50.800
I mean that.
Fully responsible.

33:53.110 --> 33:54.870
I can't believe
I just said that.

33:54.900 --> 33:57.770
Can we get
the Hypnocil by tomorrow?

33:57.820 --> 33:59.570
We're going to try.

34:00.250 --> 34:04.370
I hope you know
what you're getting us into.

34:10.679 --> 34:16.150
Ain't gonna dream no more,
no more

34:16.190 --> 34:20.940
Ain't gonna dream no more

34:20.989 --> 34:26.260
All night long, I sing this song

34:26.300 --> 34:29.679
Ain't gonna dream no more

34:37.820 --> 34:39.219
Girl, what are you doing?

34:39.260 --> 34:41.590
- Watching TV.
- I can see that.

34:41.630 --> 34:44.800
Why don't you read a book?
You watch too much damn TV.

34:44.830 --> 34:45.909
Research.

34:45.949 --> 34:49.110
Right.
You're going to be a TV star.

34:49.150 --> 34:50.679
Wait and see.

34:50.710 --> 34:53.080
If Simms catches you here
after lights out...

34:53.120 --> 34:54.969
she's gonna chew my ass.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.340
I gotta stay up, Max.

34:57.630 --> 34:59.290
Just tonight, please?

34:59.330 --> 35:01.630
I can't handle the nightmare.

35:03.010 --> 35:05.790
Not after Phillip. Not tonight.

35:13.380 --> 35:14.840
I never saw you.

35:14.870 --> 35:16.790
Thanks, Max.

35:36.920 --> 35:39.200
Hi, sweet stuff. Good news.

35:39.230 --> 35:40.990
Can't be good news,
coming from you.

35:41.030 --> 35:43.810
- Pulled night duty.
- So?

35:43.840 --> 35:47.450
So, got the keys to heaven,
baby.

35:47.490 --> 35:50.010
- What?
- The dispensary.

35:50.040 --> 35:53.280
I am talking
clean pharmaceutical high...

35:53.310 --> 35:55.070
a night at Club Meth.

35:55.110 --> 35:56.960
I don't do that shit.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.510
Yeah?
What are those, beauty marks?

35:59.550 --> 36:03.030
- Those are ancient history.
- Oh, yeah?

36:03.070 --> 36:05.630
If you're ever in the mood
for a history lesson...

36:05.670 --> 36:07.810
I'm your teacher, understand?

36:07.840 --> 36:12.600
Stay out of my face,
or I'll go straight to Max.

36:12.640 --> 36:15.960
Who's going to take the word
of a crazy junkie chick?

36:16.000 --> 36:17.310
Fuck off!

37:06.220 --> 37:09.510
It's silly to ask, but how many
of what did they kill?

37:09.540 --> 37:13.150
Don't say that. I love animals.

37:13.190 --> 37:16.190
I bought it red,
so I didn't know what it was.

37:16.230 --> 37:17.920
Probably an artificial bird.

37:17.950 --> 37:19.650
Ever go to acting school?

37:19.680 --> 37:23.360
Not in the beginning.
I started on a talk show.

37:23.400 --> 37:26.460
So you don't always say
you have to study?

37:26.500 --> 37:29.820
I think you should
study, work...

37:29.870 --> 37:32.760
then maybe you can make it.

37:32.800 --> 37:34.910
- Can I ask you something?
- Certainly.

37:34.950 --> 37:37.340
Who gives a fuck what you think?

37:50.990 --> 37:55.590
One, two,
Freddy's coming for you

37:55.630 --> 38:00.260
Three, four,
better lock the door

38:19.530 --> 38:24.230
This is it, Jennifer...
your big break in TV.

38:24.270 --> 38:27.020
Welcome to prime time, bitch!

38:51.920 --> 38:55.040
Don't be ashamed, young man.

38:55.080 --> 38:57.290
This is a place for sorrow.

38:58.250 --> 39:00.110
What faith do you follow?

39:02.770 --> 39:04.140
Science, I suppose.

39:05.380 --> 39:06.810
Sad choice.

39:06.860 --> 39:10.090
There are times when it doesn't
offer much comfort.

39:14.350 --> 39:17.770
I've seen you before, Sister...

39:17.800 --> 39:19.630
Mary Helena.

39:21.100 --> 39:24.420
You do volunteer work
at the hospital.

39:24.460 --> 39:27.910
From time to time,
when I'm needed.

39:32.530 --> 39:35.140
I should have been able
to save them.

39:35.180 --> 39:37.480
Only one thing
can save the children.

39:37.510 --> 39:42.440
The unquiet spirit
must be laid to rest.

39:42.480 --> 39:47.530
It is an abomination
to God and to man.

39:53.550 --> 39:55.620
Excuse me, sister.

39:57.880 --> 39:59.840
What are you doing up here?

39:59.890 --> 40:01.100
I was talking to...

40:02.770 --> 40:04.360
To who?

40:05.710 --> 40:07.560
Doesn't matter.

40:07.600 --> 40:09.490
Are you ready to go now?

40:09.520 --> 40:10.670
Sure.

40:21.080 --> 40:22.530
Are you finished?

40:22.580 --> 40:26.120
Yeah. I'm sorry.
I guess I'm not hungry.

40:26.160 --> 40:27.340
That's OK.

40:32.210 --> 40:34.600
That's pretty. What is that?

40:37.910 --> 40:40.360
This is my Malaysian dream doll.

40:40.400 --> 40:43.370
It's supposed to bring
good dreams.

40:44.310 --> 40:47.130
I could use some of that
right about now.

40:54.130 --> 40:56.500
You know, I used to think...

40:56.530 --> 40:58.190
I could do something
for the kids...

40:58.230 --> 41:00.170
make some kind of difference...

41:00.210 --> 41:03.000
but they're slipping through
my fingers, every one.

41:04.410 --> 41:06.600
You're doing the best
you can for them, Neil.

41:08.560 --> 41:09.640
Am I?

41:09.680 --> 41:12.710
I'm running out of answers.

41:12.750 --> 41:15.820
A patient sleepwalks
out of a high-security ward.

41:15.860 --> 41:17.320
A girl alone in a room dies.

41:17.370 --> 41:19.780
I can't believe
this is happening.

41:21.080 --> 41:22.740
Nothing makes any sense.

41:26.200 --> 41:28.050
Then maybe you're ready.

41:29.360 --> 41:31.250
For what?

41:31.280 --> 41:32.660
The truth.

41:33.650 --> 41:35.410
Try me.

41:35.610 --> 41:37.500
Only if you're willing
to put aside...

41:37.530 --> 41:39.730
everything you've learned
and trust me.

41:40.880 --> 41:42.470
Can you do that?

41:44.590 --> 41:46.060
I can do that.

41:50.810 --> 41:53.110
Straight talk only in this room.

41:53.140 --> 41:55.760
- Is this group?
- Yeah, unofficially.

41:55.800 --> 41:59.480
Soon there won't be enough
of us left to call it group.

41:59.510 --> 42:03.250
Listen up, you guys.
Nancy has something to say.

42:04.310 --> 42:06.620
I know who's trying to kill you.

42:06.640 --> 42:09.490
Don't humor us.
We're not in the mood.

42:09.530 --> 42:13.490
He wears a dirty brown hat.

42:13.530 --> 42:15.440
He's horribly burned.

42:16.860 --> 42:19.750
He has razors on his right hand.

42:22.230 --> 42:23.410
Who is he?

42:24.640 --> 42:26.970
His name is Freddy Krueger.

42:28.280 --> 42:31.150
He was a child murderer
before he died.

42:31.200 --> 42:34.090
And after he died...

42:34.140 --> 42:35.900
he became something worse.

42:36.500 --> 42:41.110
Six years ago,
he killed my friends.

42:41.140 --> 42:42.840
He almost killed me.

42:42.870 --> 42:44.530
Why is he after us?

42:44.570 --> 42:46.770
Yeah. What did we do?

42:46.810 --> 42:48.820
It's not you.

42:48.850 --> 42:53.360
Your parents, my parents...
they burned him alive.

42:53.400 --> 42:56.270
And now we're paying
for their sins.

42:57.630 --> 43:01.210
You are the last
of the Elm Street children.

43:02.360 --> 43:05.180
Mom and Dad...
I mean, that's crazy.

43:05.210 --> 43:06.700
They never mentioned anything...

43:06.750 --> 43:09.470
Sure. Parents tell
their kids that sort of thing...

43:09.500 --> 43:11.380
'Good night. Say your prayers.

43:11.420 --> 43:14.320
"By the way, we torched
some maniac last night."

43:14.370 --> 43:16.570
So what do we do
about this creep?

43:16.980 --> 43:19.120
Kristen is the key.

43:19.160 --> 43:23.220
She has a very special talent.
A gift.

43:23.260 --> 43:25.940
I haven't been able to do that
since I was little.

43:25.980 --> 43:29.330
- You did it the other night.
- That was different.

43:29.380 --> 43:34.190
You never lose a gift like that.
You just forget how to use it.

43:34.240 --> 43:35.990
How about it? Will you try?

43:38.020 --> 43:40.860
All of you have
this inner strength...

43:40.890 --> 43:43.680
some special power
that you've had...

43:43.700 --> 43:45.650
in your most wonderful dreams.

43:45.690 --> 43:49.760
Together, we can learn
to use that power if we try.

43:49.790 --> 43:51.000
You sound like Peter Pan.

43:52.350 --> 43:53.980
Remember, open mind?

43:55.810 --> 43:59.520
Taryn,
would you pull the shades down?

43:59.550 --> 44:02.780
We're going to try
a little group hypnosis.

44:13.090 --> 44:19.130
I want you all to follow
this pendulum with your eyes.

44:19.160 --> 44:20.820
Tune out everything else.

44:21.790 --> 44:24.610
Nothing else exists
but the pendulum.

44:24.640 --> 44:26.680
Take us there, Kristen.

44:27.650 --> 44:30.590
Breathe deeply and relax.

44:31.750 --> 44:34.200
Starting with your toes,
relax everything...

44:34.240 --> 44:36.700
till there's no tension
left in your bodies.

44:38.690 --> 44:40.190
Keep following the pendulum.

44:42.560 --> 44:44.570
You find yourselves
getting tired.

44:46.280 --> 44:48.830
Nothing would feel better
right now...

44:48.870 --> 44:53.990
than a nice, long, deep sleep.

44:55.400 --> 44:57.850
I'm going to count backwards
from five.

44:57.890 --> 45:00.310
When I finish...

45:00.360 --> 45:04.350
you will all be asleep.

45:05.340 --> 45:07.040
Five...

45:07.070 --> 45:08.730
four...

45:08.770 --> 45:10.360
three...

45:10.400 --> 45:12.340
two...

45:12.380 --> 45:13.600
one.

45:26.020 --> 45:27.330
Sorry.

45:27.360 --> 45:29.780
That's OK. We'll try again.

45:29.830 --> 45:31.610
Everybody take five.

45:38.210 --> 45:39.550
I was willing
to go through with this...

45:39.590 --> 45:44.680
for the kids' peace of mind,
but you'll have to face reality.

46:17.310 --> 46:21.060
Joey, I just wanted to get you
alone for a second.

46:21.090 --> 46:24.800
I mean, look, I really like you.

46:25.670 --> 46:27.620
Do you like me?

46:27.650 --> 46:29.060
I know this sounds crazy...

46:29.090 --> 46:32.260
but I make up excuses to come
into the ward every day...

46:32.300 --> 46:34.200
just to see you.

46:34.250 --> 46:36.100
You're so cute.

46:39.500 --> 46:41.800
Let's just try one more time.

46:41.830 --> 46:44.830
If it doesn't work,
I promise I'll...

46:50.660 --> 46:52.230
We're here.

46:53.190 --> 46:56.580
- Where here?
- We're in the dream.

46:56.620 --> 46:59.970
No, we're not.
We're still here in the group.

47:03.250 --> 47:06.210
In my dreams, I can walk.

47:06.250 --> 47:08.360
My legs are strong.

47:08.400 --> 47:11.330
In my dreams,
I am the Wizard Master.

47:19.750 --> 47:22.620
Try something, Kristen.
What can you do in your dream?

47:35.820 --> 47:38.370
A perfect score.
The crowd goes wild.

47:40.580 --> 47:41.670
Dig this.

47:46.950 --> 47:48.970
Kincaid, please.

47:49.960 --> 47:51.370
That's very unnerving.

47:51.400 --> 47:53.160
Hey, check out Taryn.

47:53.200 --> 47:55.330
In my dreams, I'm beautiful...

47:56.940 --> 47:59.550
and bad.

47:59.590 --> 48:03.210
I could get into
a lot of trouble for this.

48:05.070 --> 48:08.420
But I know you won't
say anything, will you?

48:09.620 --> 48:11.660
Unzip me.

48:24.970 --> 48:27.340
Do you like my body, Joey?

49:14.900 --> 49:18.550
What's wrong, Joey?
Feeling tongue-tied?

49:51.540 --> 49:53.400
What's happening?

49:53.430 --> 49:55.250
- He's close.
- Who, Freddy?

49:55.280 --> 49:56.390
He's heavy in the halls.

49:56.440 --> 49:58.290
- Where's Joey?
- Freddy's got him.

50:02.290 --> 50:04.500
Quiet, everyone! Listen.

50:11.670 --> 50:12.620
The room's changing.

50:14.070 --> 50:15.860
What the heck's going on here?

50:15.890 --> 50:17.070
What's happening?

50:20.720 --> 50:23.220
Get away from the wall.

50:27.930 --> 50:29.230
Help!

50:42.610 --> 50:44.470
Don't panic! Quiet down!

50:49.400 --> 50:51.890
This isn't real!

50:52.500 --> 50:53.610
Get us out!

50:54.390 --> 50:55.950
Quiet! The door!

50:57.850 --> 51:00.150
What's going on in here?

51:00.180 --> 51:03.030
What's wrong with Joey?

51:05.970 --> 51:07.220
Code blue.

51:07.260 --> 51:08.500
Oh, my God.

51:15.710 --> 51:18.640
He's in a deep coma.
There's nothing we can do.

51:18.680 --> 51:20.850
This is inexcusable.

51:20.890 --> 51:22.640
The session was unauthorized.

51:22.680 --> 51:24.690
It was purposely conducted
without my knowledge.

51:24.730 --> 51:27.450
Unusual steps were called for.

51:27.480 --> 51:29.680
Is that what I should
tell his parents?

51:29.720 --> 51:32.470
I understand you prescribed
a highly experimental drug.

51:32.500 --> 51:34.130
He's not in a coma...

51:34.170 --> 51:36.660
Your opinion
is of no interest to me.

51:36.690 --> 51:40.630
Furthermore, you've created
panic among the patients.

51:40.670 --> 51:42.490
That's not true.

51:42.530 --> 51:45.830
In four days,
we've had two suicides.

51:45.880 --> 51:47.310
Now he's in a coma.

51:47.350 --> 51:50.650
It's safe to say your approach
has failed, entirely.

51:50.690 --> 51:53.880
You're both relieved of duty.
I want you out today.

51:57.060 --> 51:58.770
I'm sorry, Neil.

51:58.810 --> 52:01.360
I'm afraid
you brought it on yourself.

52:01.400 --> 52:02.810
For God's sake, Elizabeth...

52:02.840 --> 52:05.690
will you please just try
to help the kids?

52:05.730 --> 52:07.660
Will you listen to them?

52:07.710 --> 52:09.430
Of course I will.

52:14.330 --> 52:16.700
What are we going to do?

52:16.740 --> 52:19.100
There's nothing that we can do.

52:19.130 --> 52:21.040
It's out of our hands.

52:59.040 --> 53:00.390
Sister!

54:38.050 --> 54:40.830
This is where it began.

54:40.870 --> 54:43.970
This wing's been closed
for years.

54:44.010 --> 54:46.150
What was this place?

54:46.180 --> 54:50.460
Purgatory... fashioned
by the hands of men.

54:51.430 --> 54:54.750
Twisted, lonely souls.

54:54.790 --> 54:57.720
The worst
of the criminally insane...

54:58.820 --> 55:02.430
were locked up in here
like animals.

55:02.470 --> 55:06.020
This whole facility
was shut down in the forties.

55:06.060 --> 55:07.880
Some sort of scandal?

55:09.160 --> 55:11.520
A young girl on the staff...

55:11.560 --> 55:15.960
was accidentally locked in here
over the holidays.

55:16.010 --> 55:20.160
The inmates
kept her hidden for days.

55:20.200 --> 55:24.390
She was raped...
hundreds of times.

55:25.550 --> 55:29.340
When they found her,
she was barely alive...

55:29.380 --> 55:32.230
and with child.

55:32.270 --> 55:35.330
That girl was Amanda Krueger.

55:35.370 --> 55:36.890
Her child...

55:38.120 --> 55:43.490
The bastard son
of a hundred maniacs.

55:43.530 --> 55:46.850
Some say he was murdered...

55:46.890 --> 55:48.900
though no body was ever found.

55:51.090 --> 55:56.800
You said something before
about laying him to rest.

55:56.840 --> 56:00.160
You must find the remains...

56:00.210 --> 56:03.550
and bury him in hallowed ground.

56:10.120 --> 56:12.220
Hallowed ground?

56:12.260 --> 56:13.730
Sister?

56:16.140 --> 56:20.420
If your only faith is science,
Doctor...

56:20.460 --> 56:24.770
it may be you
that's laid to rest.

56:27.020 --> 56:29.060
Wait!

56:29.110 --> 56:30.630
Sister!

56:48.980 --> 56:51.010
Let go of him, you bastard.

56:55.660 --> 56:56.780
Oh, my God.

57:08.400 --> 57:10.630
I've got to go in.
We have no choice.

57:10.670 --> 57:13.540
Getting yourself killed
won't help the kids at all.

57:15.340 --> 57:17.280
Besides, we do have a choice.

57:18.410 --> 57:20.460
Assuming your mysterious nun
is right.

57:21.420 --> 57:22.670
I've heard weirder things
this week.

57:25.140 --> 57:27.340
All right. Whoever she is...

57:27.380 --> 57:30.190
she seems to know
more about Krueger than I do.

57:30.230 --> 57:33.190
The question is,
what happened to his body?

57:34.380 --> 57:37.320
They burned him to death
in his boiler room...

57:37.360 --> 57:39.050
and they hid the remains.

57:39.090 --> 57:40.500
Who would know
where they're hidden?

57:41.940 --> 57:43.440
Only one man knows...

57:44.940 --> 57:47.600
and it's time for him to talk.

57:51.640 --> 57:54.120
You can't take Nancy
away from us!

57:54.160 --> 57:55.470
She's all we have!

57:55.510 --> 57:57.390
You're a sick girl, Kristen.

57:57.430 --> 57:59.530
If you want to get better,
you must trust me now.

58:06.890 --> 58:09.070
Take her to the quiet room
and sedate her.

58:10.390 --> 58:13.550
You stupid bitch!
You're killing us!

58:21.140 --> 58:23.180
All right, everybody.
Back to bed.

58:41.200 --> 58:42.310
Hi, Daddy.

58:46.800 --> 58:49.300
Well, if it isn't
my little girl.

58:52.020 --> 58:53.970
My baby come to see her daddy?

58:55.760 --> 58:57.420
It's been a long time.

58:58.740 --> 59:00.650
But you're here. Sit down.

59:01.940 --> 59:04.980
What did I do to get so lucky?

59:05.690 --> 59:08.620
I thought that you were
trying to forget me.

59:09.180 --> 59:12.080
That's not true.
You're the one trying to forget.

59:16.030 --> 59:19.340
I need your help, Dad.
Krueger's back.

59:24.250 --> 59:27.510
Fred Krueger is dead.

59:27.550 --> 59:30.710
You always had a little trouble
trying to understand that.

59:30.740 --> 59:32.150
You know what he did.

59:34.260 --> 59:35.670
He's doing it again.

59:37.370 --> 59:38.740
She's telling you the truth.

59:39.520 --> 59:40.660
I don't believe we've met...

59:40.690 --> 59:43.310
and this isn't
any of your goddamn business.

59:43.350 --> 59:48.240
We can stop him this time...
stop him for good...

59:48.280 --> 59:51.220
but we need to know
where his bones were hidden.

59:53.560 --> 59:57.750
I've lost too much
over this already.

59:57.790 --> 59:59.200
I'm through with it.

59:59.220 --> 01:00:02.290
People are still dying
after all this time.

01:00:02.330 --> 01:00:04.370
Stop running away from it.

01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:08.720
You owe me.

01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:11.440
It was nice seeing you again,
princess.

01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:13.870
Next time, don't...

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:15.700
don't stay away so long.

01:00:24.510 --> 01:00:27.360
I'll be OK.
Just give me a minute.

01:00:30.970 --> 01:00:32.080
It's the hospital.

01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:45.050
- Dr. Gordon?
- Taryn.

01:00:45.090 --> 01:00:47.930
You've got to come right away.
Kristen had a total shit attack.

01:00:47.970 --> 01:00:50.550
Simms doped her up
and put her in the quiet room.

01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:53.620
Simms put Kristen
in the quiet room for the night.

01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:55.930
- They sedated her.
- Oh, no.

01:00:55.970 --> 01:00:58.810
She can't stay awake for long.
She's all alone.

01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:01.210
Freddy's going to get her.

01:01:01.250 --> 01:01:03.900
Just stay cool.
Help is on the way.

01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:05.050
Just hurry!

01:01:05.090 --> 01:01:06.500
I got to get there.

01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:09.370
- You go. I'll get the remains.
- It's no use.

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:11.920
I'll talk to him.
Make Simms understand.

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:14.010
She'll never understand.
I got to get to Kristen.

01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:16.410
Be careful.

01:01:30.780 --> 01:01:34.100
My name is Neil Gordon.
Pleased to meet you.

01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:35.900
There, now we've met!

01:01:35.930 --> 01:01:37.530
Now listen to me!

01:01:37.570 --> 01:01:41.460
Maybe you don't care whether
Nancy lives or dies, but I do!

01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:46.240
You and I are going
on a little scavenger hunt.

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:04.920
Please, God...

01:02:06.370 --> 01:02:08.160
don't make me sleep.

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:20.510
What the hell are we doing here?

01:02:25.030 --> 01:02:26.460
I won't be long.

01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:16.960
What do you think you're doing?

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.940
Look, I'm sorry.

01:03:19.970 --> 01:03:23.290
I really need this. I got...

01:03:23.330 --> 01:03:25.670
I'll reimburse you.

01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:28.450
You keep my driver's license.
I'll be back.

01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:44.670
Max, I need to see Kristen.

01:03:45.710 --> 01:03:48.640
- You don't understand.
- Save your breath.

01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:50.500
Dr. Simms
gave me specific instructions.

01:03:50.530 --> 01:03:52.830
No one sees Kristen,
especially you.

01:03:52.870 --> 01:03:55.620
But, Max, she needs me.
She's in danger.

01:03:55.650 --> 01:03:57.190
You got to believe me!

01:03:57.230 --> 01:04:01.090
I really think you mean well,
but my kids been dying off...

01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:05.440
and even without Simms' orders,
I wouldn't let you near her.

01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:11.320
OK, Max. I understand.

01:04:11.370 --> 01:04:13.640
Can I say good-bye
to the others?

01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:14.820
I don't know.

01:04:14.850 --> 01:04:17.540
It'll be my last chance.

01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:21.610
Five minutes.
They're in the TV room.

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:27.880
Where have you been?

01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:29.810
There's no time. Come on.

01:04:29.830 --> 01:04:32.110
- Where?
- Our last group.

01:04:46.450 --> 01:04:47.560
In there.

01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:51.850
We knew nobody would ever
find it in that place.

01:04:54.190 --> 01:04:56.300
I'm not sure
I can find it myself anymore.

01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:28.810
It's deep in the heart
of the place.

01:05:28.850 --> 01:05:30.440
Take it slow.

01:05:46.610 --> 01:05:48.200
Straight talk only in here.

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:50.610
What about Kristen?

01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:52.490
We can't get to her. I tried.

01:05:53.490 --> 01:05:56.970
I was hoping we'd have more time
to learn to use the dreams...

01:05:57.750 --> 01:06:01.160
but Joey's in there.
Kristen's going in, too.

01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:02.790
They need us.

01:06:02.830 --> 01:06:05.930
We're trying to go in,
to link up?

01:06:05.970 --> 01:06:07.390
It's now or never.

01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:10.250
I'm not going to kid you.
This is dangerous.

01:06:10.290 --> 01:06:12.710
If you die in this dream,
it's for real.

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:15.310
Nobody has to go in
that doesn't want to.

01:06:18.930 --> 01:06:20.490
I'm in.

01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:23.460
Me, too.

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:27.700
Let's go kick the motherfucker's
ass all over dreamland.

01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:32.590
Remember, you have to stay
together whatever happens.

01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:34.520
That's the only way
we can beat him.

01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:43.490
All right.
Clear your mind of everything.

01:06:48.310 --> 01:06:50.990
Picture yourself
in the quiet room...

01:06:51.020 --> 01:06:53.710
the soft, white walls...

01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:55.920
the total silence...

01:06:55.950 --> 01:06:58.710
only the sound
of your heart beating.

01:06:58.730 --> 01:07:01.740
Picture yourself there
with Kristen.

01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:05.200
I'm going to count backwards
from five...

01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:08.170
and when I'm done,
we'll all be asleep.

01:07:08.210 --> 01:07:11.080
We'll all be in the quiet room.

01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:14.470
Five...

01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:17.940
four...

01:07:20.690 --> 01:07:21.800
three...

01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:25.680
two...

01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:29.030
one.

01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:35.090
I knew you'd come.

01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:36.950
We wouldn't let you go in alone.

01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:39.880
No way. We're a team!

01:07:39.930 --> 01:07:43.730
Listen, everybody.
Joey needs us. I can feel him.

01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:45.290
Where is he?

01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:47.450
How do we find him?

01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:57.870
Stay in the middle of the room!

01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:01.910
Whatever happens, stay together!

01:08:18.649 --> 01:08:21.359
You'll wake up
the whole neighborhood.

01:08:22.479 --> 01:08:25.359
Why are you still up?
It's past 1:00.

01:08:27.029 --> 01:08:31.090
I just thought I'd wait for you.

01:08:31.130 --> 01:08:33.370
Well, I'm home.

01:08:33.399 --> 01:08:34.830
You can get to sleep now.
Come on.

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:35.920
Andale.

01:08:43.290 --> 01:08:44.700
What's that for?

01:08:44.729 --> 01:08:46.640
I'm just glad you're home.

01:08:52.670 --> 01:08:55.569
Mom, I had the most awful dream.

01:08:55.609 --> 01:08:58.460
Elaine,
where do you keep the bourbon?

01:08:58.490 --> 01:08:59.920
I'll be right down.

01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:03.029
Kris, I've got a guest.

01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:05.450
I just don't want to be alone.

01:09:07.609 --> 01:09:11.090
I said
where's the fucking bourbon?

01:09:13.279 --> 01:09:15.580
You should listen
to your mother!

01:09:15.609 --> 01:09:17.500
God damn it, Kristen,
you ruin everything!

01:09:17.540 --> 01:09:19.160
Every time I bring a man home,
you spoil it!

01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:22.770
You know what your shrink says?
You just want attention!

01:09:57.190 --> 01:09:58.610
Is that you?

01:10:50.820 --> 01:10:52.860
Welcome home, Taryn.

01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:55.490
Look familiar?

01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:59.450
OK, asshole, let's dance!

01:11:13.730 --> 01:11:16.210
Why should we fight?

01:11:16.260 --> 01:11:18.620
We're old friends, you and I.

01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:20.090
Remember?

01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:25.430
Let's get high.

01:11:46.370 --> 01:11:48.410
What a rush.

01:12:02.410 --> 01:12:05.270
You guys? Where are you?

01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:11.010
Is somebody there?

01:12:30.660 --> 01:12:33.180
You look tired.

01:12:33.220 --> 01:12:34.650
Have a seat.

01:12:35.690 --> 01:12:39.000
No, thanks.
I'm fine just the way I am.

01:12:39.050 --> 01:12:40.960
For now, maybe.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.850
But when you wake up...

01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:47.050
it's back...

01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:49.450
in the saddle...

01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:51.270
again.

01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:00.550
My leg!

01:13:04.910 --> 01:13:07.560
It's the chair for you, kid!

01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:09.050
I am the Wizard Master.

01:13:11.910 --> 01:13:13.230
I am the Wizard Master!

01:13:22.830 --> 01:13:26.950
In the name of Lowrek,
Prince of Elves, demon begone!

01:13:35.950 --> 01:13:39.630
Sorry, kid.
I don't believe in fairy tales.

01:13:47.630 --> 01:13:49.380
Somebody?

01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:02.060
What is that?

01:14:02.090 --> 01:14:03.750
I don't know.

01:14:10.090 --> 01:14:11.820
Yo. I thought I heard voices.

01:14:13.010 --> 01:14:14.280
Kincaid, I could kiss you.

01:14:18.890 --> 01:14:20.650
What's stopping you?

01:14:22.130 --> 01:14:23.810
Cool. So where's Joey?

01:14:23.850 --> 01:14:25.860
I don't know.
This place is a maze.

01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:28.460
It's time to stop guessin'
and start messin'.

01:14:28.500 --> 01:14:31.560
Yo, Freddy, where you hiding,
you burnt-face pussy!

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:33.320
We should find the others first.

01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:35.730
You think you're hot shit,
don't you?

01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:37.180
Come get a piece of me!

01:14:37.230 --> 01:14:39.760
Krueger, pussy!

01:14:41.170 --> 01:14:43.530
I knew he was a little chicken.

01:14:43.570 --> 01:14:44.850
Shit.

01:14:59.190 --> 01:15:02.420
- It's a door.
- But it doesn't go anywhere.

01:15:03.540 --> 01:15:05.190
Yes, it does.

01:15:18.990 --> 01:15:20.080
This is it.

01:15:20.110 --> 01:15:21.640
Are you ready?

01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:26.250
Let's snuff the sucker.

01:16:10.510 --> 01:16:12.400
That's it.

01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:14.790
The Caddy.

01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:19.900
Going somewhere?

01:17:23.510 --> 01:17:26.990
I said I'd show you where
the goddamn thing was.

01:17:27.030 --> 01:17:28.440
I never said I'd stick around.

01:17:28.470 --> 01:17:31.290
- We've got work to do.
- What are you talking about?

01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:33.210
You're about to attend
a funeral...

01:17:33.250 --> 01:17:35.700
one that's long overdue.

01:18:36.890 --> 01:18:39.420
Joey, look.

01:18:39.450 --> 01:18:42.770
All the little piggies
come home.

01:18:42.810 --> 01:18:44.370
Let him go, Krueger!

01:18:44.410 --> 01:18:48.280
Your wish is my command.

01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:11.650
He's never been this strong.

01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:20.600
The souls of children...

01:20:20.650 --> 01:20:22.470
give me strength.

01:20:29.100 --> 01:20:30.810
Always room for more.

01:20:54.630 --> 01:20:57.020
- What's that?
- What?

01:21:05.540 --> 01:21:07.160
Listen.

01:21:12.650 --> 01:21:14.560
Somebody else is out here.

01:21:18.730 --> 01:21:19.840
We're alone.

01:21:55.370 --> 01:21:57.440
Bury the fucking thing!

01:22:12.490 --> 01:22:13.920
It's really you.

01:22:17.450 --> 01:22:20.930
I killed you once before,
you son of a bitch.

01:23:03.950 --> 01:23:05.550
Let's try this way.

01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:08.490
Kristen, can you pull us out?

01:23:08.530 --> 01:23:10.280
They sedated me.
We're stuck here.

01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:11.850
It's a dead end.

01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:14.760
What the hell?

01:23:18.700 --> 01:23:20.640
Sorry to keep you waiting.

01:23:20.690 --> 01:23:24.550
Perhaps if there was more of me
to spread around.

01:24:18.230 --> 01:24:20.460
Wow.

01:24:20.500 --> 01:24:21.910
Did I say that?

01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:24.050
You found your dream power.

01:24:24.090 --> 01:24:25.610
You saved us, Joey.

01:24:25.650 --> 01:24:28.620
- You blew him away!
- Put me down.

01:24:28.660 --> 01:24:30.060
Are you OK?

01:24:30.100 --> 01:24:31.630
I think so.

01:24:31.660 --> 01:24:33.490
He's gone.

01:24:35.060 --> 01:24:36.690
It's over.

01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:52.270
Daddy?

01:24:52.310 --> 01:24:54.960
I've crossed over, princess.

01:24:58.110 --> 01:25:00.210
Crossed over?

01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:03.730
I couldn't go without
telling you how sorry I am...

01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:06.700
for all the things I've done.

01:25:06.740 --> 01:25:08.680
I love you so much.

01:25:10.100 --> 01:25:11.560
I'll always love you.

01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:15.050
I'll always love you.

01:25:27.130 --> 01:25:28.620
Die.

01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:47.950
You're mine now, little piggy.

01:26:12.020 --> 01:26:14.960
Please, God, for the children.

01:26:15.010 --> 01:26:16.440
For Nancy.

01:26:17.820 --> 01:26:19.340
Ashes to ashes.

01:26:24.190 --> 01:26:25.560
Dust to dust.

01:26:29.530 --> 01:26:32.210
Lay this spirit to rest.

01:26:50.110 --> 01:26:53.010
I won't let you die.
I won't let you.

01:26:53.050 --> 01:26:56.440
I'm going to dream you
into a beautiful dream...

01:26:56.480 --> 01:26:58.170
forever and ever.

01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:11.450
'Trust in Him at all times.

01:27:11.580 --> 01:27:13.720
'Pour out your hearts to Him...

01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:15.640
'for God is our refuge.

01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:17.500
'Hear my cry, O God.

01:27:17.530 --> 01:27:18.940
'Listen to my prayer.

01:27:18.980 --> 01:27:21.970
'From the ends of the earth,
I call to you.

01:27:22.020 --> 01:27:23.870
'I call as my heart grows faint.

01:27:23.900 --> 01:27:26.290
'Lead me to the rock
that is higher than I.

01:27:26.330 --> 01:27:28.540
'For You have been my refuge...

'a strong tower against the foe.

"I long to dwell
in the tent forever...

'and take refuge in the shelter
of Your wings."

01:27:36.730 --> 01:27:39.420
Even though we entrust Nancy
to the earth...

01:27:39.460 --> 01:27:42.140
her courage and spirit
shall remain with us...

01:27:42.180 --> 01:27:44.380
