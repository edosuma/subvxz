00:08.627 --> 00:12.173
CHRISTIANE F.
WE CHILDREN FROM ZOO STATION

01:02.195 --> 01:06.617
<i>Piss and shit everywhere</i>
<i>If you look close enough</i>

01:07.952 --> 01:12.875
<i>At first sight it looks fine,</i>
<i>with its lawns...</i>

01:13.709 --> 01:16.254
<i>...and shopping centres.</i>

01:16.463 --> 01:20.426
<i>But the staircases of the</i>
<i>flats stink!</i>

01:21.553 --> 01:24.682
<i>What are the children to do,</i>
<i>when they are playing outside?</i>

01:25.224 --> 01:31.816
<i>They shit themselves waiting for the lift, </i>
<i>so instead they do it in the lobby.</i>

01:57.765 --> 02:03.606
<i>I've lived here since I was six,</i>
<i>together with my mother, sister and a cat.</i>

02:04.357 --> 02:07.110
<i>And I'm tired of it.</i>

02:09.280 --> 02:11.825
<i>The posters hang all over the city...</i>

02:12.200 --> 02:17.248
<i>'Sound' - Europe's most modern discoteque!</i>
<i>I want to go there.</i>

03:12.526 --> 03:16.281
<i>One day I said to my mother:</i>
<i>I'll sleep at Kessi's</i>

03:16.531 --> 03:21.162
<i>Kessi is the coolest girl in my class,</i>
<i>everybody likes her</i>

03:22.289 --> 03:26.085
<i>She already has big breasts;</i>
<i>I admire her</i>

03:26.794 --> 03:32.176
<i>'Sound' is her second home;</i>
<i>She's there every weekend, and knows everybody</i>

03:33.052 --> 03:36.098
<i>This will be my first time</i>

03:39.227 --> 03:41.313
Come on!

03:56.499 --> 03:58.960
Is she 16?

04:00.587 --> 04:03.299
Of course, she's in my class

04:21.279 --> 04:24.784
-Is Atze here ?
-When isn't he here?

04:25.035 --> 04:30.791
Please put down the bag
You can't walk around with a plastic bag in here

05:13.145 --> 05:15.722
Wait a moment..

05:35.207 --> 05:36.750
Cherry Juice, please!

06:44.961 --> 06:47.131
-Come on!
-We're in the Cinema

07:47.207 --> 07:49.209
Here!

07:52.964 --> 07:56.677
-Don't you want any?
-I don't feel like it!

07:57.219 --> 08:00.932
-First time?
-I just don't feel like it!

08:56.378 --> 08:58.297
Stop that shit!

10:57.197 --> 10:59.533
You shouldn't have taken that pill

11:04.790 --> 11:06.834
Can't take it?

11:26.484 --> 11:28.487
Are you OK?

11:42.170 --> 11:44.048
He's Axel

11:46.509 --> 11:48.470
I'm Detlev

11:51.098 --> 11:52.892
I'm going back in

12:08.954 --> 12:10.373
You want to get back in?

12:19.384 --> 12:21.053
See you!

12:42.997 --> 12:48.337
-Pitty, where have you been?
-He's been playing with the kids

12:48.588 --> 12:53.344
-Why weren't you in school?
-I have packed my things

12:54.846 --> 12:56.056
What?

13:03.023 --> 13:05.526
Has the old man won you over?

13:10.532 --> 13:13.119
Is it because of Mother's new friend?

13:19.710 --> 13:22.756
It's dad
He's waiting for me downstairs

13:23.215 --> 13:26.928
Mom is struggling to keep up,
and all you want is to get away from here

13:27.220 --> 13:30.265
You should be glad
More stuff for you

13:30.474 --> 13:33.603
No, I'd rather see you stay

13:35.898 --> 13:39.027
And I want to try living with Dad

13:39.736 --> 13:45.118
-And what about the fights in the past?
-He wants to make up for everything

13:50.667 --> 13:52.252
Follow me down?

14:16.532 --> 14:19.286
Won't you think about it?

14:29.132 --> 14:31.426
I don't understand you

14:50.992 --> 14:53.704
Any message for Dad?

14:58.168 --> 14:59.670
Don't be grumpy

15:43.109 --> 15:45.645
What are you doing in the dark?

15:54.239 --> 15:56.283
Did you meet Sabine?

16:00.497 --> 16:04.961
-Now we're all alone
-She will be back

16:05.253 --> 16:09.300
-You think?
-It won't work

16:13.013 --> 16:14.223
You know what?

16:15.349 --> 16:18.436
We're having a lovely evening together

16:21.941 --> 16:23.735
Turn it over

16:26.113 --> 16:29.283
-Watch out! It runs...
-That's the whole point!

16:37.043 --> 16:43.551
It's Klaus, I invited him
Just so we're not alone. Do you mind?

16:49.309 --> 16:52.605
Can I borrow your shoes?

16:52.813 --> 16:54.691
Are you going out?

16:58.904 --> 17:00.948
Just over to Kessi's

17:03.326 --> 17:05.119
If you have to

17:11.170 --> 17:12.896
I have something for you

17:19.513 --> 17:21.808
Hope you like it!

17:28.108 --> 17:30.152
Thanks!

17:49.301 --> 17:52.722
Shall we go somewhere?
Anywhere?

17:52.973 --> 17:56.227
-Coming with us?
-Where?

18:00.649 --> 18:02.651
I'm really too tired

18:03.986 --> 18:05.947
You can sleep when you're dead

19:14.075 --> 19:15.035
The Police!

20:14.552 --> 20:16.287
I hope they didn't catch Kessi

20:16.320 --> 20:22.200
-My mom thinks I'm sleeping at her place
-And her mom thinks she's sleeping at yours?

20:28.336 --> 20:30.380
Are you often at 'Sound'?

20:34.260 --> 20:37.889
-Will you be there next week?
-Of course!

20:41.853 --> 20:43.688
We're really high up

20:47.860 --> 20:49.863
I get all dizzy

20:52.116 --> 20:54.577
You haven't taken anymore trips, have you?

20:57.789 --> 21:00.543
You don't care for them, right?

21:00.877 --> 21:02.921
Not really

21:09.137 --> 21:10.889
Want one?

21:28.578 --> 21:30.623
Did you make that yourself?

21:32.750 --> 21:37.757
-Didn't it hurt?
-Yes, but I was bored

21:47.519 --> 21:49.396
It's almost dawn

21:53.026 --> 21:57.824
-Are you going home?
-What about you?

21:59.096 --> 22:02.329
I'm going back to my place;
come with me, if you like

22:04.290 --> 22:06.877
I live with Axel

22:16.639 --> 22:18.517
Are you angry?

22:23.481 --> 22:26.360
We thought the cops caught you

22:30.156 --> 22:32.159
Look, two Martians

22:32.409 --> 22:35.997
She was that loaded, there was hardly
enough room for her in the lift

22:36.247 --> 22:37.123
The Police

22:37.332 --> 22:39.543
Over here

22:41.504 --> 22:44.090
I think they're still looking for us

22:44.341 --> 22:49.139
You ought to arrest him;
he's an addict

24:14.455 --> 24:17.125
You're coming with me

24:20.379 --> 24:22.507
Keep away from my daughter

24:23.550 --> 24:25.594
Kessi has no use for bad influences

26:06.847 --> 26:09.976
Can you do your homework
with all that noise?

26:11.019 --> 26:13.355
It's Klaus' record

26:15.691 --> 26:18.236
It's the record Klaus gave me

26:19.529 --> 26:22.408
That doesn't mean it should
be played so loud

26:36.885 --> 26:40.640
David Bowie is coming to Berlin

26:41.724 --> 26:43.977
The guy on the record Klaus gave me

26:44.227 --> 26:45.688
You want to go?

26:48.733 --> 26:51.278
Can Kessi come, too?

26:52.905 --> 26:55.450
I often sleep at her place

27:00.748 --> 27:04.378
I might get some tickets
through work

27:05.755 --> 27:07.757
Have you hurt yourself?

27:14.265 --> 27:16.310
It's a tattoo

27:17.436 --> 27:18.980
A what?

27:20.356 --> 27:23.569
A tattoo, it's not finished

27:28.367 --> 27:31.287
But that's permanent?

27:36.210 --> 27:38.212
Well, you have to walk around with it

27:41.967 --> 27:47.099
-I've just met a boy
-And he has one just like it

27:50.144 --> 27:55.943
You know, I didn't really think of
going to the concert with Kessi

27:57.003 --> 27:59.322
I get you

28:14.925 --> 28:20.265
-Are you going to the concert, too?
-I can't afford it

28:41.481 --> 28:44.696
Detlev?

29:26.766 --> 29:29.812
What have you bought?
'H'?

29:31.606 --> 29:36.070
You can swallow three trips at once,
or something else to turn you on

29:36.278 --> 29:40.575
I can get you anything,
but leave 'H' alone

29:46.708 --> 29:48.836
Otherwise, I won't see you again

30:13.158 --> 30:16.037
Axel, Detlev wants to take 'H'

30:16.996 --> 30:18.707
If he fancies it

30:21.252 --> 30:22.920
Didn't you understand me?

30:24.339 --> 30:26.175
If he wants to take it, he will

30:29.345 --> 30:33.601
-Can't you talk to him?
-Me, of all people?

30:34.268 --> 30:35.895
What do you mean?

30:36.271 --> 30:38.482
I thought you were his friend

30:38.857 --> 30:40.735
I thought he lived at your place

30:48.787 --> 30:50.789
Stay cool, kid

30:54.627 --> 30:57.673
Take something before you flip out

31:00.118 --> 31:04.723
Look at them. The cooler they are,
the more shots they've had

35:07.697 --> 35:09.282
What's up?

35:13.037 --> 35:17.376
-You look like a corpse
-Because I'm a blood donor

35:17.626 --> 35:21.548
-Why do you do it?
-Because I need the dough

35:26.971 --> 35:30.226
I'll see if somebody's got
a Valium left for us

36:36.476 --> 36:39.063
Mandrax. I couldn't get Valium

42:53.286 --> 42:57.499
-Is he ill?
-He needs a shot

42:57.709 --> 43:01.838
-Apart from me, who doesn't shoot up?
-No one I know

43:04.534 --> 43:07.136
Got any dough?

43:08.639 --> 43:10.842
Twenty marks

43:11.075 --> 43:14.145
I'll get some. Wait outside

43:41.514 --> 43:45.602
I've got some. And I've got
my old man's car

43:46.270 --> 43:48.731
Ciao, thanks for the dough

44:42.007 --> 44:43.676
Open up

44:47.681 --> 44:49.517
I want to try it

44:50.936 --> 44:53.730
No way

44:55.524 --> 44:56.984
I paid for it

44:58.110 --> 45:00.405
I want my share

45:02.616 --> 45:04.869
Let me in

46:33.398 --> 46:35.442
I don't shoot up, I just sniff

46:39.322 --> 46:40.240
Really?

46:44.328 --> 46:47.749
-Just once
-As they all say

46:49.251 --> 46:51.796
I'm in control of myself

46:53.423 --> 46:56.677
Take that, and you'll soon be
as far gone as me

46:57.345 --> 47:01.475
-You'll be a corpse then
-From giving blood?

49:03.421 --> 49:05.966
Why don't you join us?

49:07.342 --> 49:09.762
Something wrong?

49:13.183 --> 49:15.770
Got a trip for me?

49:17.522 --> 49:20.401
What do you want with a trip?

49:20.776 --> 49:24.823
-Do you want a drink?
-Cherry juice

49:26.033 --> 49:28.578
I'll get it
I won't be long

49:33.292 --> 49:38.131
-What did Babsie want from you?
-A trip

49:39.216 --> 49:44.181
Be careful, don't give her one.
She swallows all she can get

49:46.559 --> 49:50.981
-And what do you do?
-It's not the same at all

49:54.402 --> 49:57.948
Know somewhere I can sleep?

50:00.576 --> 50:02.621
Your own home

50:03.246 --> 50:07.335
I don't want to go home,
I'm fed up with it

50:10.088 --> 50:13.217
There're some sexy guys here

50:41.795 --> 50:43.839
Are you crazy?

50:45.300 --> 50:48.679
-You can talk
-Do you copy everything I do?

50:54.812 --> 50:59.901
I only wanted to know
what you feel like

51:07.411 --> 51:09.455
Groovy, eh?

51:15.922 --> 51:18.258
Axel, it's me

51:29.439 --> 51:32.276
Make yourself at home

51:42.539 --> 51:45.376
This is for you

51:46.460 --> 51:48.004
Axel made it for you

51:49.881 --> 51:50.841
Really??

52:43.032 --> 52:45.577
Does your mother know
where you're sleeping?

52:45.952 --> 52:48.706
Sure, she isn't stupid

52:53.545 --> 52:56.632
We see each other only at weekends

52:57.800 --> 53:01.013
We can meet when I come back
from school

53:01.555 --> 53:03.599
We can't do that

53:05.727 --> 53:07.771
Why not?

53:13.070 --> 53:14.530
I go to Bahnhof Zoo Station

53:14.905 --> 53:16.741
What for?

53:26.170 --> 53:28.172
Pick-ups

53:29.090 --> 53:30.717
Bullshit

53:32.428 --> 53:34.430
Honestly

53:50.617 --> 53:52.161
Really?

54:02.465 --> 54:04.593
With the pansies?

54:08.473 --> 54:10.559
I only jerk them off

54:10.893 --> 54:13.438
It's nothing, considering
what they pay

54:14.063 --> 54:16.608
Don't you go to bed with them?

54:19.404 --> 54:22.741
Yes, but even then I don't do more

54:31.252 --> 54:32.545
What do you feel?

54:37.844 --> 54:42.683
It's a job. They mustn't touch me

54:43.935 --> 54:49.775
I won't let them jerk me off.
It wouldn't be a job then

54:54.198 --> 54:59.621
-So it doesn't excite you
-It's repulsive. Just for dough

55:05.211 --> 55:07.381
Don't you like me so much now?

55:35.083 --> 55:36.918
Good night

56:11.712 --> 56:15.300
You can get up now.
My mother has left

56:35.293 --> 56:39.497
-Are you fourteen already?
-I'm an adult from today on

56:46.057 --> 56:49.218
That looks great

56:52.097 --> 56:53.724
You reckon?

56:57.103 --> 57:01.567
-Have you got anything to wear?
-I didn't come here naked

57:02.393 --> 57:06.782
-You can't wear the same old rags
-Why not?

57:13.691 --> 57:17.712
Clean things. You can wear
my Bowie jacket

57:19.882 --> 57:22.260
Here's something to turn you on

57:24.554 --> 57:26.807
Do you have any 'H'?

57:29.644 --> 57:30.979
Are you crazy?

57:37.320 --> 57:38.739
Don't touch it

57:39.574 --> 57:42.160
I only want to try it

57:42.194 --> 57:44.580
I can control it

57:44.913 --> 57:47.091
As they all say

58:32.641 --> 58:35.603
When you leave, shut the door
properly

58:36.780 --> 58:38.565
Come again soon

58:38.982 --> 58:41.027
Sure, I will

59:53.410 --> 59:56.455
Hey, girl, how much?

01:00:09.764 --> 01:00:14.269
Excuse me, do you fuck? I pay a lot

01:00:14.603 --> 01:00:19.234
Muhametto, leave her alone.
Go on, clear off

01:00:19.443 --> 01:00:22.196
Are you catching a train?

01:00:22.446 --> 01:00:25.575
No. Are you? Looking for Detlev, too?

01:00:25.784 --> 01:00:28.454
Has he disappeared?

01:00:37.215 --> 01:00:42.138
There's "Pissnelke".
He lets me piss on him

01:00:42.472 --> 01:00:45.309
-What does he do?
-It's what he wants

01:00:45.893 --> 01:00:46.852
Nonsense

01:00:47.144 --> 01:00:49.105
Ask him yourseIf

01:00:53.569 --> 01:00:55.572
I stand over him and piss

01:00:55.822 --> 01:00:59.827
-I can't do it if I'm watched
-He grabs my prick

01:01:01.830 --> 01:01:03.540
Axel, come here

01:01:05.334 --> 01:01:07.879
Axel can do that.
The punters like him

01:01:09.589 --> 01:01:10.507
Who's that?

01:01:13.177 --> 01:01:16.765
'Stuttering Max'. He only comes
when he's flogged

01:01:20.019 --> 01:01:21.646
Look who's here

01:01:38.709 --> 01:01:45.426
Don't come here. I won't have
my girl friend coming to 'Zoo'

01:01:50.391 --> 01:01:53.436
The scum of the earth.
You don't belong here

01:01:55.873 --> 01:01:58.927
Especially not on your birthday

01:02:03.703 --> 01:02:07.003
I wanted to bring cake for you

01:02:11.251 --> 01:02:15.005
And this. Mother said I was to
buy myself something nice

01:02:37.367 --> 01:02:42.080
'Who wants to piss in my mouth?
I drink anything'

01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:45.377
Axel, there's something for you

01:03:18.585 --> 01:03:21.506
-I want to shoot up today, too
-No way 

01:03:22.207 --> 01:03:25.928
Whether I shoot or sniff,
it makes no difference

01:03:28.048 --> 01:03:31.644
-It does. A shot is like a hammer
-Don't talk shit

01:03:32.854 --> 01:03:35.732
It's a sexual climax

01:03:46.121 --> 01:03:52.170
Shit, it's clogged. Try and see
if you can get one through

01:04:07.982 --> 01:04:11.653
-You can ditch that one after
-Don't talk crap

01:04:31.511 --> 01:04:34.056
Can you lend me your kit?

01:04:40.189 --> 01:04:42.942
Keep clear of that, girl

01:05:45.605 --> 01:05:47.065
Please help me

01:06:15.142 --> 01:06:17.854
You've no idea

01:07:38.915 --> 01:07:40.834
How was it?

01:07:44.088 --> 01:07:47.884
I had a different idea of
a sexual climax

01:08:06.032 --> 01:08:08.828
Do you want to sleep with me
during the weekend?

01:08:12.624 --> 01:08:14.668
If you like

01:08:19.966 --> 01:08:21.969
On one condition

01:08:25.724 --> 01:08:27.600
No 'H'

01:10:42.983 --> 01:10:45.083
I love you so

01:10:56.433 --> 01:11:01.001
We must stop shooting up

01:11:03.658 --> 01:11:05.658
You mustn't get hooked

01:11:16.108 --> 01:11:18.608
I don't want you to die

01:13:22.151 --> 01:13:27.341
Mother wonders why I'm not fatter,
with all these sandwiches

01:13:29.342 --> 01:13:31.094
Got a shot for me?

01:13:31.195 --> 01:13:32.291
You won't get one from me

01:13:32.398 --> 01:13:38.105
Don't be mean. Your pupils are
pinheads, yet you tell me to stop

01:13:39.606 --> 01:13:42.262
At least you can stay clean

01:13:45.263 --> 01:13:47.863
You just want to hog it all

01:13:53.391 --> 01:13:58.091
I want to be on the same level as you

01:14:04.971 --> 01:14:08.042
O.K, a small shot

01:14:09.643 --> 01:14:13.993
I'll do the next punter for you.
See him?

01:14:17.053 --> 01:14:20.096
He's crazy about me 

01:14:24.897 --> 01:14:28.067
-Don't go to him!
-Why?

01:14:29.068 --> 01:14:32.073
Because he has a crush on you

01:14:33.374 --> 01:14:36.674
That'll make him pay well

01:15:38.423 --> 01:15:41.094
Why didn't you show up?

01:15:42.695 --> 01:15:46.083
No time. I've got a regular guy

01:15:47.684 --> 01:15:50.005
Sunk really low, eh?

01:15:52.006 --> 01:15:54.075
Look who's talking

01:15:54.076 --> 01:15:55.527
You fuck?

01:15:56.028 --> 01:16:00.099
-She fucks hell out of them
-What makes you so sure?

01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:07.024
-You let them stick it in anywhere
-Jealous? You hump with foreigners

01:16:07.125 --> 01:16:10.795
-Shall we celebrate our reunion?
-I'm waiting for my dope

01:16:10.796 --> 01:16:12.081
I'll lend you some

01:16:12.882 --> 01:16:16.023
-I did seven tricks in an hour
-You blew them all?

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.045
Seven in an hour. A lot of dough

01:16:23.646 --> 01:16:27.066
-With condoms?
-You can do it with them, too

01:16:27.067 --> 01:16:32.323
Without you might catch oral clap

01:16:32.324 --> 01:16:38.015
"At fourteen he was on drugs. He took
an overdose in a fit of desperation"

01:16:39.030 --> 01:16:41.584
One less after the stuff

01:16:41.585 --> 01:16:45.840
'As long as something's left to
shoot, I'll never take an overjolt'

01:16:45.841 --> 01:16:49.041
'Deeply moving farewell letter of
seventeen-year-old Andreas W'

01:16:57.706 --> 01:17:02.106
I know him. That's Atze

01:17:56.447 --> 01:17:58.184
Be seeing you

01:17:59.184 --> 01:18:00.820
What's up?

01:18:02.021 --> 01:18:06.528
-That was my last shot. Must get some
-What about me?

01:18:08.029 --> 01:18:12.367
I need some for tomorrow morning.
I can't go to school otherwise

01:18:13.068 --> 01:18:16.691
I need some right now, or I'll
have the horrors in two hours

01:18:18.592 --> 01:18:20.492
I must go now

01:18:30.557 --> 01:18:32.057
It's O.K.

01:18:39.818 --> 01:18:44.744
You know what? Maybe I can help you

01:18:47.745 --> 01:18:50.917
Maybe I can get something begging

01:18:52.918 --> 01:18:54.918
I'll be at Kurfürstendamm

01:19:11.126 --> 01:19:14.026
CouId you give me a mark?
I need a mark

01:19:22.924 --> 01:19:26.882
Could you give me a mark
for the subway?

01:19:30.183 --> 01:19:32.183
Old jerk!

01:20:22.098 --> 01:20:24.698
-Are you crazy?
-Get in

01:20:39.253 --> 01:20:42.728
-What's up?
-What do you think?

01:20:46.129 --> 01:20:48.398
I don't do humping

01:20:49.099 --> 01:20:52.399
-Why not?
-I'm going steady

01:20:58.094 --> 01:21:01.916
-You'll blow, then
-That makes me puke

01:21:03.017 --> 01:21:06.840
That doesn't leave much

01:21:09.041 --> 01:21:12.179
AII right, just jerk me off

01:21:14.380 --> 01:21:16.180
For one hundred marks

01:21:34.306 --> 01:21:35.906
First the dough

01:23:39.113 --> 01:23:40.613
I've got some

01:23:58.321 --> 01:24:01.058
You got a lot

01:24:01.359 --> 01:24:03.896
Where did you get so much?

01:24:05.197 --> 01:24:07.566
Begging didn't work

01:24:08.067 --> 01:24:10.325
I jerked off a guy

01:24:15.026 --> 01:24:17.746
He gave me one hundred

01:24:18.247 --> 01:24:20.216
Are you having me on?

01:24:21.217 --> 01:24:23.671
Honest, I only jerked him off

01:24:25.002 --> 01:24:27.242
One hundred marks for that?

01:24:28.043 --> 01:24:30.280
What should I have done, then?

01:24:32.981 --> 01:24:35.181
I did it for you

01:24:47.016 --> 01:24:50.258
What I told you was true

01:24:53.659 --> 01:24:55.959
I did it for you

01:25:07.793 --> 01:25:14.093
You did it for yourself, because
you were scared of going short

01:25:21.110 --> 01:25:25.310
You'd have done it even if
I hadn't existed

01:25:37.513 --> 01:25:40.013
This is all because we shoot up

01:25:47.710 --> 01:25:52.610
But we'll make it, we'll start
to withdraw some time

01:25:59.158 --> 01:26:02.958
We'll withdraw with Valeron

01:26:06.167 --> 01:26:10.967
And I promise I won't turn tricks
with a punter

01:26:50.322 --> 01:26:52.322
We'll make it yet

01:28:15.113 --> 01:28:17.513
Christiane, hurry up

01:28:26.004 --> 01:28:28.194
Why lock the door?

01:28:35.339 --> 01:28:38.539
I must leave, I'll be late

01:29:07.062 --> 01:29:09.162
Why are you taking so long?

01:29:17.992 --> 01:29:20.592
You'll be late for school

01:29:27.489 --> 01:29:30.006
Christiane, do you hear me?

01:29:37.301 --> 01:29:40.701
Unlock the door, what's the idea?

01:29:51.035 --> 01:29:53.635
What's the matter?

01:30:20.288 --> 01:30:22.724
Get a face-cloth

01:30:23.425 --> 01:30:26.425
Shall I call a doctor?

01:30:49.008 --> 01:30:52.465
My child, what's the matter?

01:30:55.466 --> 01:30:57.466
My circulation

01:31:45.396 --> 01:31:50.154
-What are you doing here?
-Your mother called for me

01:31:52.955 --> 01:31:55.955
At 'Zoo'?

01:32:02.601 --> 01:32:05.054
So we can withdraw together

01:32:05.655 --> 01:32:10.061
If we withdraw together,
that will be the end

01:32:11.562 --> 01:32:14.562
Rubbish, not with us

01:36:03.205 --> 01:36:05.605
I can't stand it anymore

01:36:14.619 --> 01:36:16.539
Are you crazy?

01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:20.040
Keep off that

01:36:26.385 --> 01:36:29.885
Let me. Please, let me

01:36:41.737 --> 01:36:44.737
Just a little sniff against the pain

01:38:33.328 --> 01:38:37.632
Bernd, you're still alive, old boy

01:38:37.633 --> 01:38:42.457
-Sure. And where have you two been?
-Take a good look at us

01:38:43.558 --> 01:38:47.312
-You're clean, eh?
-Did you withdraw?

01:38:48.113 --> 01:38:50.067
You bet

01:38:51.768 --> 01:38:53.354
They've withdrawn

01:38:54.255 --> 01:38:55.657
You really did it?

01:38:57.258 --> 01:39:01.129
Yes, we really did it.
It wasn't all that bad

01:39:01.130 --> 01:39:06.322
All you need is lots of Valeron,
Valium and suchlike

01:39:08.923 --> 01:39:11.011
I think that's great

01:39:14.012 --> 01:39:16.432
You can do it, too, Axel. Really

01:39:17.233 --> 01:39:19.285
Shall we do it?

01:39:19.686 --> 01:39:21.104
Really?

01:39:21.505 --> 01:39:24.028
I'll get dough for Valeron

01:39:26.729 --> 01:39:29.018
We can start with it next week

01:39:32.219 --> 01:39:36.092
We'll tell Babsie and Stella,
they might join us

01:39:36.893 --> 01:39:41.967
A cool, clean clique. We'll only
smoke grass sometimes

01:39:43.868 --> 01:39:49.225
I could have started today,
but I've bought 'H' already

01:39:50.826 --> 01:39:53.226
We can still shoot that

01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:02.408
Sure, that's O.K.

01:40:02.809 --> 01:40:05.809
We'll be back soon

01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:29.141
That was really something, eh?

01:40:29.742 --> 01:40:33.097
That really was crazy

01:40:34.198 --> 01:40:37.071
On the first day already

01:40:39.672 --> 01:40:44.446
If we keep it under control, be
careful not to get addicted to it

01:40:46.647 --> 01:40:49.218
We know now that we can quit

01:40:51.019 --> 01:40:54.119
So we can permit ourselves one shot

01:41:01.883 --> 01:41:04.483
We couId ask them if they have
a shot for us

01:41:19.522 --> 01:41:21.922
O.K, let's ask

01:45:16.137 --> 01:45:19.137
Axel, don't you know it's Saturday?

01:45:33.676 --> 01:45:36.331
They're letting you starve

01:45:38.032 --> 01:45:41.032
You've no water, either

01:46:14.294 --> 01:46:18.194
-We can't just leave him there
-Want to take him with you?

01:46:27.728 --> 01:46:30.228
Hurry up!

01:46:41.713 --> 01:46:44.115
Why did he kill himseIf?

01:46:44.216 --> 01:46:48.140
He didn't. Some pig
sold him strychnine

01:46:51.041 --> 01:46:57.041
I can't stand this shit any more

01:47:01.054 --> 01:47:06.054
I need a shot! I need a shot!

01:47:16.890 --> 01:47:19.914
Where will you live now?

01:47:23.715 --> 01:47:26.136
With my bloke

01:47:27.737 --> 01:47:32.444
-The one with a crush on you?
-Who else?

01:47:34.145 --> 01:47:37.087
You're a fine friend

01:47:41.188 --> 01:47:43.308
Have you got a better idea?

01:47:45.210 --> 01:47:48.346
You'd let any pansy shove his prick
up your arse

01:47:48.547 --> 01:47:52.704
You think I like foreigners
humping you?

01:47:54.705 --> 01:48:01.505
Do you know what you are? The
lousiest creature I've ever met

01:48:42.732 --> 01:48:45.653
I'm sorry

01:48:47.154 --> 01:48:51.111
I've never let them hump me

01:48:53.212 --> 01:48:56.150
All I ever do is blow

01:48:57.651 --> 01:49:01.051
Me, too

01:49:10.150 --> 01:49:14.250
We must stop with this stuff

01:49:18.544 --> 01:49:22.166
Yes, that's O.K.

01:49:23.667 --> 01:49:26.790
But now I need a shot

01:49:29.001 --> 01:49:30.791
Or I won't hold out

01:49:39.954 --> 01:49:45.554
-But we haven't got any dough
-Shit! I'll get some

01:49:51.569 --> 01:49:52.954
O.K. Fifteen marks

01:49:53.355 --> 01:50:00.055
Are you crazy? Some are brand new.
This one's still in its wrapper

01:50:03.167 --> 01:50:07.805
-Seventeen
-Let's say twenty

01:50:08.006 --> 01:50:11.506
-Find someone else
-O.K., seventeen

01:54:29.655 --> 01:54:32.155
Thanks

01:55:15.066 --> 01:55:24.066
Babsie, Babsie!
have you got something for me?

01:55:56.965 --> 01:56:00.457
In a year they'll be where we are

01:56:04.758 --> 01:56:07.629
I'm giving it up

01:56:09.030 --> 01:56:13.538
-Why are you still here, then?
-I'll really start tomorrow

01:56:16.439 --> 01:56:20.645
I'll withdraw tomorrow

01:56:22.146 --> 01:56:25.985
I think that's really great

01:56:27.186 --> 01:56:31.192
Either I stop... or I die

01:56:32.793 --> 01:56:35.248
You'll stop, for sure

01:56:37.549 --> 01:56:43.249
And when I've made it, I mean after
the therapy... what then?

01:56:59.593 --> 01:57:03.366
You know what? I'll give it up, too

01:57:04.567 --> 01:57:09.290
I'll join you in therapy.
We'll withdraw together

01:57:10.491 --> 01:57:14.798
-Really?
-You'll see, we'll make it yet

01:57:17.199 --> 01:57:19.799
You bet?

01:58:26.187 --> 01:58:28.189
What's this?

01:58:28.790 --> 01:58:30.190
Come to me

01:58:45.912 --> 01:58:48.100
Stay here

01:58:50.701 --> 01:58:53.104
Look at me

01:58:53.705 --> 01:58:55.505
I need money

01:59:04.151 --> 01:59:06.688
Stay here

01:59:07.689 --> 01:59:09.689
I only jerk them off

01:59:39.930 --> 01:59:41.730
Look

02:01:17.019 --> 02:01:21.109
It doesn't turn you on, eh?

02:01:23.310 --> 02:01:25.179
Just a job

02:01:25.480 --> 02:01:29.280
What can I do, then? Tell me

02:01:35.008 --> 02:01:37.708
Have you seen Babsie?

02:01:43.769 --> 02:01:47.469
Have you seen Babsie?

02:02:11.471 --> 02:02:13.100
The little one?

02:02:13.151 --> 02:02:18.697
It's been some time. She might have
kicked the bucket, or be in jail

02:02:19.698 --> 02:02:23.098
Don't talk such crap

02:02:29.511 --> 02:02:32.197
You need a shot, girl

02:02:32.205 --> 02:02:39.005
I don't. I'm just looking for Babsie

02:02:52.340 --> 02:02:58.297
If you've got one. You still
owe me one, anyway

02:02:58.798 --> 02:03:02.298
Sure, but right now I haven't
got one myseIf

02:03:18.389 --> 02:03:22.343
Tina, got anything for me?

02:03:22.644 --> 02:03:25.344
Find your own stuff

02:04:24.706 --> 02:04:26.175
Have you got the time?

02:04:26.976 --> 02:04:31.176
You old pig, leave me alone

02:05:41.018 --> 02:05:44.018
<i>Berlin's youngest drug victim</i>

02:05:49.863 --> 02:05:52.863
<i>She was only fourteen</i>!

02:08:15.380 --> 02:08:17.799
<i>I survived</i>

02:08:16.800 --> 02:08:21.556
<i>Mum took me to my Gran and Auntie,</i>
<i>in a village near Hamburg</i>

02:08:22.457 --> 02:08:26.196
<i>I've been clean for eighteen months</i>

02:08:27.197 --> 02:08:33.600
<i>It frightens me to think of Detlev.</i>
<i>I often think of him</i>

02:08:33.805 --> 02:08:38.001
<i>I'd like to give him some of my</i>
<i>strength, and help him</i>

02:08:38.060 --> 02:08:42.198
<i>But first I need the strength myself</i>

02:08:42.499 --> 02:08:48.189
<i>Dedicated to Andreas W, "Atze",</i>
<i>Axel W., Babette D, "Babsie"</i>

02:08:48.390 --> 02:08:55.306
<i>And all the others who lacked</i>
<i>the strength and luck to survive</i>
