00:02.870 --> 00:03.790
Oh, well, you know,

00:03.930 --> 00:05.370
at least you get to make a
lot of use out of that dress.

00:05.650 --> 00:06.970
Who needs a walk down the aisle

00:07.120 --> 00:08.830
when you can parade around
the E.R. waiting room?

00:08.980 --> 00:10.320
Do I look like I'm parading?

00:10.510 --> 00:11.670
Come on. No one's parading.

00:11.930 --> 00:14.640
I am. Look, we all heard the
doctor. She's gonna be fine.

00:14.830 --> 00:16.079
This isn't to do with the cancer.

00:16.239 --> 00:18.140
- So who wants potato chips? 
- Oh, I do.

00:19.070 --> 00:21.060
- Anyone else? 
- No. Please.

00:22.720 --> 00:24.980
Wow. It's hard to believe

00:25.140 --> 00:27.280
that we were all
supposed to be in Hawaii.

00:27.540 --> 00:29.630
Right, and now it's like
the ten plagues of Egypt...

00:30.250 --> 00:33.980
Hurricane, relocated wedding,
collapsed maid of honor...

00:34.130 --> 00:36.080
- Mom's date's a no-show.
 - Groom freak out.

00:36.290 --> 00:38.110
- Don't forget about the
knocked-up bride.  - Mm.

00:38.290 --> 00:41.560
This wedding is more
cursed than Liza MinnellI's.

00:42.010 --> 00:44.680
- That's the gayest thing ever to come out of your mouth, Saul. 
- Ever.

00:44.980 --> 00:47.090
- Robert. 
- Hey, wh... where is she?

00:47.310 --> 00:48.940
- 157. 
- Go, go, go, go.

00:57.030 --> 00:59.150
# Come lay down tonight #

00:59.460 --> 01:01.460
# While we have the time #

01:01.750 --> 01:03.880
# You'll rest in my arms #

01:06.120 --> 01:06.790
Robert.

01:07.730 --> 01:08.920
I'm so glad you're here.

01:10.920 --> 01:11.980
How long has she been sleeping?

01:13.040 --> 01:14.230
About an hour or so.

01:16.640 --> 01:19.620
She had a c... a clot in her lung.

01:20.520 --> 01:21.770
They gave her some
medicine to break it up.

01:21.920 --> 01:23.590
So she's breathing fine now.

01:23.980 --> 01:25.640
We're just waiting
for her blood to thin.

01:27.440 --> 01:29.460
Thank god it didn't happen
on a plane to Hawaii.

01:30.810 --> 01:31.910
What was that hurricane's name?

01:32.290 --> 01:32.830
Zelda.

01:33.050 --> 01:34.630
Zelda. I love Zelda.

01:36.500 --> 01:37.370
So look...

01:37.540 --> 01:38.990
You stay with her now, okay?

01:39.170 --> 01:40.200
She's gonna be here a few days,

01:40.390 --> 01:41.570
and she's gonna need some things,

01:41.810 --> 01:43.460
so I'm gonna rally the troops.

01:43.810 --> 01:45.460
I never should've gone to D.C.

01:46.350 --> 01:47.420
Robert, stop.

01:47.600 --> 01:49.680
When you left, as far as you
knew, the wedding was off.

01:49.860 --> 01:54.800
No one could've foreseen
this. She's gonna be okay.

02:04.990 --> 02:06.390
Okay, listen up, everybody.

02:06.550 --> 02:08.539
Listen up. We've gotta
divide and conquer.

02:08.710 --> 02:10.300
Obviously, the most
important thing is Evan.

02:10.490 --> 02:12.120
- He's been with the sitter for hours. 
- I'll get Evan.

02:12.280 --> 02:14.380
Okay, great. While you're
there, get her toiletries.

02:14.550 --> 02:16.780
You know which products
she likes. Saul, call Tommy.

02:17.080 --> 02:19.390
- Give him an update. He just landed in Seattle. 
- Okay.

02:19.560 --> 02:21.630
Justin, Rebecca, come with
me and get some of the food

02:21.880 --> 02:23.080
that Scotty made for the wedding.

02:23.880 --> 02:24.540
That's great. I'm starving.

02:24.570 --> 02:26.240
No, it's for the nurses.

02:26.410 --> 02:28.000
I want Kitty to be
their favorite patient.

02:28.410 --> 02:30.000
- Kevin. 
- Yes, lieutenant.

02:30.160 --> 02:31.660
I need you to hold down
the office for a few days

02:31.910 --> 02:33.670
so Robert doesn't need
to deal with anything.

02:33.910 --> 02:35.070
Basically what I do every day.

02:35.260 --> 02:36.550
You got it. Okay, you're dismissed.

02:36.710 --> 02:37.620
Let's go, go, go.

02:37.810 --> 02:38.640
Everybody, go.

02:47.690 --> 02:49.960
Sarah, go. You've got
Evan and toiletries.

02:50.100 --> 02:52.130
I'm going. I just wanted
to make sure you were okay.

02:52.900 --> 02:54.500
I'm fine, f...

02:54.650 --> 02:55.420
Look, Kitty's gonna wake up,

02:55.600 --> 02:57.730
and she's gonna want
to brush her... teeth.

02:57.900 --> 02:58.840
She doesn't have any hair.

02:59.380 --> 03:01.840
I was thinking about
Simon. I mean, did he call?

03:03.600 --> 03:04.820
Oh, about the wedding.

03:05.050 --> 03:07.060
Yeah, it... it... he had an emergency.

03:07.400 --> 03:08.040
Well, it's a wedding.

03:08.220 --> 03:09.780
It must have been a
hell of an emergency.

03:09.960 --> 03:12.870
Well, apparently it was. Sarah, go.

03:13.150 --> 03:15.750
- Evan and toiletries await. 
- I'm going.

03:16.000 --> 03:16.640
Okay.

03:33.990 --> 03:34.670
Oh.

03:37.780 --> 03:39.320
How long have I been asleep?

03:41.800 --> 03:42.790
About six hours.

03:44.810 --> 03:45.810
Oh, hey.

03:47.480 --> 03:48.370
Who's with Evan?

03:48.910 --> 03:49.630
Sarah.

03:50.480 --> 03:51.580
I want to see him.

03:51.940 --> 03:53.520
Oh, honey. They won't let him up here.

03:55.860 --> 03:57.860
Are you telling me that
I have to wait un...

03:58.020 --> 03:59.070
I spoke to Dr. Avadon.

04:01.470 --> 04:02.780
She told me that you knew on Friday

04:03.000 --> 04:04.550
that your M.R.I. results weren't good?

04:06.140 --> 04:07.480
Why would you keep that from me?

04:08.690 --> 04:10.600
I didn't want to spoil the wedding.

04:11.540 --> 04:14.750
Kitty, what if you had
died and I was in D.C.?

04:14.900 --> 04:16.510
What happened on the beach, Robert,

04:16.670 --> 04:19.170
had nothing to do with
the size of my tumors.

04:21.500 --> 04:24.350
You know your whole family
thinks that this ends

04:24.510 --> 04:26.290
with this blood clot.

04:28.740 --> 04:29.910
I'll talk to them.

04:33.330 --> 04:34.930
Don't be mad, honey.

04:35.660 --> 04:38.250
I am so many things right now,

04:40.640 --> 04:42.050
and mad is one of them...

04:43.850 --> 04:44.770
but not at you.

04:51.900 --> 04:52.790
It's bad.

04:56.490 --> 04:58.300
It's really, really bad.

05:00.670 --> 05:01.630
Look at me.

05:03.650 --> 05:04.910
No one's giving up.

05:06.050 --> 05:06.820
Right?

05:10.000 --> 05:11.300
Right.

05:13.970 --> 05:15.430
I want to see Evan.

05:17.660 --> 05:18.660
I'll see what I can do.

05:27.910 --> 05:28.820
I've been running all around

05:29.010 --> 05:29.830
telling everybody you're fine...

05:29.980 --> 05:31.610
If it makes you feel better,
I've already yelled at her.

05:31.740 --> 05:33.570
Robert, I'm not yelling at her.

05:33.740 --> 05:34.910
I know that the results of the M.R.I.

05:35.040 --> 05:36.140
weren't what we wanted,

05:36.330 --> 05:39.200
but not everybody responds to
the same course of treatment.

05:39.490 --> 05:41.550
And so normally, I would recommend

05:41.710 --> 05:43.990
that you now try a different chemo.

05:44.470 --> 05:47.370
But your cancer is progressing
at a rate that troubles me.

05:47.630 --> 05:49.290
So I talked to some of my colleagues,

05:49.480 --> 05:50.910
and we all agree that in your case,

05:51.920 --> 05:54.550
a bone marrow transplant
might really be the way to go.

05:55.110 --> 05:57.200
Bone marrow? But that's so aggressive.

05:57.330 --> 05:59.440
Dr. Avadon, why don't you
walk us through the numbers

05:59.580 --> 06:00.770
and tell us what our best bet would be?

06:00.960 --> 06:03.160
Okay, it's hard to talk statistics

06:03.260 --> 06:05.040
because every case is different.

06:05.180 --> 06:08.050
Um, the chemo has
proven to be problematic.

06:08.200 --> 06:09.070
I mean, that's true.

06:09.570 --> 06:11.970
Uh, the bone marrow could
prove to be curative.

06:12.450 --> 06:15.210
But there are some
serious risks involved.

06:15.350 --> 06:17.240
Well, tell us... tell her the risks.

06:17.400 --> 06:20.450
There's infection.
There's internal bleeding.

06:20.700 --> 06:23.060
Your... your body could
reject the transplant.

06:24.260 --> 06:26.750
I mean, not everyone
survives the procedure.

06:27.490 --> 06:30.470
Right. Right. I... I
understand the risks.

06:32.140 --> 06:33.580
But... What... what are the rewards?

06:34.300 --> 06:35.810
Well, that's the good news.

06:36.390 --> 06:37.350
I mean, if everything goes well,

06:38.420 --> 06:39.770
you could be living cancer free.

06:42.010 --> 06:45.090
Shouldn't she just try a
different kind of chemo,

06:45.280 --> 06:47.060
and if that doesn't work,
then move on to this?

06:47.210 --> 06:48.060
Well, she could,

06:48.340 --> 06:50.460
but if the chemo proves
unsuccessful again,

06:50.790 --> 06:52.260
then she's that much weaker.

06:52.940 --> 06:54.620
And that could seriously
increase her chances

06:54.770 --> 06:55.650
for something going wrong

06:55.880 --> 06:57.320
when she has the bone marrow transplant.

06:58.060 --> 07:01.070
Mom. Mom, cancer free.

07:02.230 --> 07:06.610
The chemo isn't working, and
I have a little boy at home.

07:07.290 --> 07:08.530
And you got to do it all.

07:08.730 --> 07:11.720
You got to take us to school
and you got to watch us grow up,

07:11.870 --> 07:13.920
you got to... to see us get married.

07:14.090 --> 07:15.150
I want to do all that.

07:18.880 --> 07:19.750
Robert?

07:23.030 --> 07:24.840
You've always swung for the fences.

07:26.190 --> 07:27.880
If this is what you want, I'm with you.

07:30.070 --> 07:30.940
Mom?

07:32.380 --> 07:34.360
Kitty, is this really what you want?

07:36.320 --> 07:37.590
I want to live.

07:40.310 --> 07:42.580
Okay. What do we do?

07:43.680 --> 07:46.680
Well, I have to stress that
in a situation like this,

07:46.830 --> 07:49.360
weeks, I mean, even days,
could make a difference.

07:50.290 --> 07:53.790
- And none of this happens until we find a... 
- Match.

07:53.990 --> 07:55.050
- A match. 
- I know.

07:55.580 --> 07:57.770
Well, it's a good thing
you had so many kids.

08:13.290 --> 08:13.870
Hey.

08:14.610 --> 08:15.190
Hey.

08:15.440 --> 08:17.770
Uh, so how was the wedding?
Sorry I didn't make it.

08:17.950 --> 08:20.440
Oh, doesn't matter. The
wedding never happened.

08:21.140 --> 08:24.910
Kitty... Well, uh,
she's in the hospital.

08:25.430 --> 08:27.980
- Oh, my god. Is she okay? 
- Yeah, they say she'll be fine.

08:28.170 --> 08:31.490
Good. So why'd you want
to see me on a Sunday?

08:32.350 --> 08:35.490
I need you to explain something.

08:35.730 --> 08:36.380
Okay.

08:36.580 --> 08:37.760
Well, it turns out

08:37.919 --> 08:41.299
that the Coastal Reserve
spill was not an accident.

08:41.500 --> 08:42.000
What?

08:42.169 --> 08:44.610
The valves on the tanks
had been tampered with.

08:45.430 --> 08:45.970
Wow.

08:47.170 --> 08:48.560
I mean, d... do... do you have any idea

08:48.700 --> 08:49.790
who might have done that?

08:49.980 --> 08:54.250
Not yet. But we know
exactly when it happened.

08:55.170 --> 08:57.210
I got a call from the
investigators today,

08:57.510 --> 09:00.380
and when they were going
through the security footage

09:00.540 --> 09:01.680
of the parking lot at the time,

09:02.730 --> 09:06.700
the only person in and out
of the building... was you.

09:08.570 --> 09:10.480
Look, I don't know what
you're trying to say,

09:10.630 --> 09:14.600
- but if you think it was... 
- I know that you have a complicated relationship

09:14.720 --> 09:15.550
with the Walkers.

09:15.830 --> 09:18.280
We have that in common.

09:19.860 --> 09:22.840
Was that your way of getting
back at William Walker?

09:23.460 --> 09:25.950
What he did to your mother was awful...

09:26.070 --> 09:26.630
No.

09:28.190 --> 09:31.410
Ryan, I am giving you

09:31.550 --> 09:33.560
the chance to come clean here.

09:33.720 --> 09:35.850
If you're honest with
me, I will do my best

09:35.990 --> 09:37.090
to protect you from
the criminal system...

09:37.200 --> 09:38.610
I am being honest with you.

09:40.990 --> 09:44.280
You understand that this
is a legal matter now,

09:44.640 --> 09:47.340
and there is nothing that
I can do to protect you.

09:47.480 --> 09:48.720
I don't need you to protect me.

09:50.510 --> 09:51.170
Ok.

09:51.390 --> 09:52.870
I didn't do anything wrong.

09:57.570 --> 09:59.630
So this is what you do all
day, sit at your computer?

09:59.780 --> 10:03.110
- Uh, yeah. I just watch YouTube videos. 
- Ah, okay. Let's go eat.

10:03.320 --> 10:04.550
As soon as I cancel Robert's speech

10:04.680 --> 10:05.920
to the Security Institute.

10:06.090 --> 10:09.350
- Oh, would you please stop
e-mailing me?  - Who is it?

10:09.480 --> 10:12.060
Oh, it's this firm we hired to
do internal opposition research.

10:13.310 --> 10:14.350
You know, when you run for office,

10:14.580 --> 10:17.200
you have to find out what the
other guy can dig up on you.

10:17.320 --> 10:18.900
Oh, what kind of stuff
are you digging for?

10:19.500 --> 10:20.490
Unpaid taxes,

10:20.640 --> 10:22.710
controversial quotes
from old college essays,

10:22.930 --> 10:23.360
that kind of thing.

10:24.430 --> 10:26.130
The guy who owns the company... Lewis...

10:26.320 --> 10:28.660
He is... he's totally out of control.

10:28.820 --> 10:29.880
He's now tailing Robert.

10:30.790 --> 10:32.180
He's meant to be
researching public records,

10:32.370 --> 10:34.400
not... not out on a spy mission.

10:34.760 --> 10:36.120
Oh, your pay is mileage.

10:37.480 --> 10:38.800
Yeah, well, that's the problem.

10:39.010 --> 10:40.690
He keeps sending me these updates

10:40.860 --> 10:42.110
about a place in Westwood.

10:42.500 --> 10:44.890
Apparently Robert's been
making biweekly visits

10:45.550 --> 10:46.260
to a house.

10:47.100 --> 10:47.660
Oh.

10:49.560 --> 10:51.610
You know what? I'm not
gonna worry about it,

10:52.330 --> 10:53.560
because I can promise you, Robert has

10:53.720 --> 10:55.350
a perfectly good reason
for being in Westwood.

10:55.490 --> 10:57.460
I'm not even gonna ask him
about it because I'm not worried.

10:57.700 --> 10:59.360
The problem is, you sound worried.

11:00.780 --> 11:02.300
Hey, Mom.

11:03.350 --> 11:03.940
Why, what's up?

11:04.940 --> 11:06.100
Yeah, sure. We can come now.

11:06.680 --> 11:08.150
Okay. Yeah, bye.

11:09.170 --> 11:11.220
- What's wrong? 
- I have to get a blood test.

11:12.730 --> 11:14.220
What if none of us are a match?

11:15.250 --> 11:16.320
To be honest, I'm
worried about what happens

11:16.470 --> 11:17.730
when one of us is a match.

11:18.780 --> 11:21.950
Sarah, this procedure is
a lot riskier than chemo.

11:22.500 --> 11:24.160
- Hey, guys. What's the status? 
- Hey.

11:24.300 --> 11:25.480
Um, we've all been tested,

11:25.620 --> 11:27.490
and, uh, Tommy's results are
being sent down from Seattle.

11:27.830 --> 11:30.050
Okay. Oh, Sarah, Kitty wants to see you.

11:30.210 --> 11:30.890
Oh.

11:33.020 --> 11:33.890
- Hang in there. 
- Okay.

11:34.230 --> 11:36.370
- Hey. 
- Oh, hey. Hey, you got a minute?

11:36.500 --> 11:39.960
- Sure. How you holding up? 
- Good, good.

11:40.250 --> 11:43.020
Um... There's something I
want you to look into for me.

11:43.740 --> 11:45.400
Anything. I think I'm being followed.

11:46.350 --> 11:48.960
- What makes you say that? 
- Because there's a guy following me.

11:49.250 --> 11:51.010
And he's not very good at it.

11:51.140 --> 11:51.840
I wrote down the make
and model of his car,

11:52.250 --> 11:54.410
license plate number, a
general description of the guy.

11:54.540 --> 11:55.930
Wow, he isn't very good, is he?

11:56.080 --> 11:57.620
Well, yeah, I'm sure he's
probably just the world's

11:57.740 --> 12:01.090
- worst reporter, but you can never be too careful. 
- Sure. No problem.

12:02.180 --> 12:02.890
Thank you.

12:04.110 --> 12:05.630
I don't think I could get
through this without you.

12:07.780 --> 12:08.770
I'll take care of this.

12:12.750 --> 12:13.570
Oh, excuse me.

12:14.270 --> 12:16.090
Finally, you're awake when I visit.

12:16.600 --> 12:18.700
Oh, Sarah. You're not
mad at me, are you?

12:18.840 --> 12:21.000
Because I can't take it if
anybody else is mad at me.

12:21.160 --> 12:22.220
How could I be mad at you?

12:23.440 --> 12:24.220
Look, Sarah, I...

12:25.870 --> 12:27.910
I need you to do something for me.

12:28.990 --> 12:30.410
Why are you whispering?

12:30.590 --> 12:33.870
In my closet, in the
back, way in the back,

12:34.040 --> 12:37.030
behind my shoes, there's
a shoe box full of letters.

12:37.730 --> 12:38.930
I need you to go to my house

12:39.180 --> 12:41.750
- and I need you to get them for me. 
- Who are they from?

12:42.230 --> 12:42.950
It doesn't matter.

12:43.150 --> 12:44.970
Then why do you want me to drive
to Santa Barbara to get them?

12:45.120 --> 12:46.780
Would you just go do this for me?

12:47.010 --> 12:48.020
Just tell me who they're from.

12:48.190 --> 12:49.140
You know I'm gonna read them anyway.

12:49.300 --> 12:50.180
No, you cannot read them. You can't.

12:50.340 --> 12:51.700
You can tell me who they're from.

12:53.450 --> 12:55.400
You remember when I
graduated from college

12:55.550 --> 12:58.050
and I went straight to
Washington to do an internship?

12:58.650 --> 13:00.360
You pulled a Monica Lewinsky?

13:00.690 --> 13:02.440
No, no. We never got caught.

13:03.020 --> 13:04.950
I was kidding.

13:06.940 --> 13:07.700
Well...

13:08.900 --> 13:10.710
He was older,

13:11.370 --> 13:13.130
and he was very important to me,

13:13.300 --> 13:14.610
and I was very important to him.

13:14.840 --> 13:16.640
And we... it didn't last long,

13:16.810 --> 13:19.490
but we started writing to each other.

13:20.070 --> 13:22.050
W... like erotica?

13:23.300 --> 13:27.360
- It was political and intellectual... 
- and personal. Oh, right. Okay.

13:27.550 --> 13:30.000
- Anyway, if anything, God forbid,

13:30.130 --> 13:31.690
should happen to me
during this procedure,

13:31.820 --> 13:33.430
Robert cannot read those letters.

13:33.540 --> 13:35.270
Hey, just stop that.

13:36.660 --> 13:37.630
That's not gonna happen.

13:37.940 --> 13:39.850
Okay, fine. Look, I'll make you a deal.

13:40.600 --> 13:43.550
You go get my shoe box,
and I promise, I won't die.

13:49.200 --> 13:50.840
Ryan, it's Nora.

13:51.680 --> 13:53.160
Please, would you call me back?

13:54.240 --> 13:54.920
Nora.

13:56.070 --> 13:58.320
Saul, do you know where Ryan is?

13:58.460 --> 13:59.580
He... he's not answering his phone.

13:59.740 --> 14:02.310
There's a problem at Ojai.
Holly thinks that he's to blame.

14:02.530 --> 14:04.150
I called his house. I
called his cell phone.

14:04.810 --> 14:06.450
She thinks that maybe he left town.

14:06.940 --> 14:10.540
Oh. No. No one else is match.

14:10.700 --> 14:11.830
We have to find him.

14:12.040 --> 14:13.590
- You're kidding. 
- No, and this is the only thing

14:13.760 --> 14:16.080
that's given Kitty hope
in a very long time.

14:16.240 --> 14:17.580
I can't look her in the face and say,

14:17.730 --> 14:18.860
"sorry, it didn't work out."

14:19.240 --> 14:21.290
If there's the slightest chance
that Ryan could be a match,

14:21.430 --> 14:25.380
- then I have to find him. 
- Yeah.

14:31.310 --> 14:33.480
Listen, I am over my head,
and I really need your help.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.160
Holly said that there's security footage

14:35.320 --> 14:37.980
- of my car in the parking lot. 
- So what? That's not proof of anything.

14:38.160 --> 14:40.130
Yeah, I know, but I just really
need to get out of town, okay?

14:40.260 --> 14:41.380
Is there any way that you
could get me some money?

14:41.560 --> 14:42.840
Our arrangement wasn't about money.

14:43.630 --> 14:45.000
I thought this was about getting even.

14:45.190 --> 14:47.050
It was, I know. But it's
just... it's gone too far,

14:47.250 --> 14:49.170
- and I want out. 
- All right, look look...

14:50.150 --> 14:51.570
I'll see if I can get you some money.

14:52.060 --> 14:54.680
In the meantime, you've
gotta calm yourself down.

14:55.250 --> 14:57.060
Yeah, that's easy for
you to say. I gotta go.

15:00.510 --> 15:01.340
Ryan Lafferty?

15:02.910 --> 15:03.780
Yeah.

15:04.420 --> 15:05.470
Need you to come with me.

15:09.100 --> 15:11.250
- I'm sorry you're unhappy with me. 
- Forget it.

15:11.460 --> 15:13.800
What's the name of your company,
lame and conspicuous, Inc.?

15:14.050 --> 15:16.350
Uh, no. Actually, you can
make it out to I.R.I....

15:16.540 --> 15:18.270
Imperforate Research, Incorporated.

15:18.430 --> 15:20.550
All right, we're done. Goodbye.

15:21.720 --> 15:23.090
Well, at least let me
leave you with this.

15:25.250 --> 15:26.560
Her name is Christine Hein.

15:27.740 --> 15:29.010
Would you please leave?

15:30.700 --> 15:31.580
Hey, Justin.

15:32.580 --> 15:33.920
Wh... none of us?

15:34.460 --> 15:35.670
All right. I'll meet
you at the hospital.

15:36.010 --> 15:37.810
Okay, bye. What are
you still doing here?

15:38.070 --> 15:39.870
You're only getting rid of
me because you know I'm right.

15:54.690 --> 15:56.090
Oh, Sarah, hi.

15:56.260 --> 15:57.700
Every time I see your shoe collection,

15:57.900 --> 15:59.810
- I'm more impressed. 
- So you're in the closet.

15:59.970 --> 16:01.120
I think it's towards the bottom.

16:01.930 --> 16:06.410
Okay, Louboutins, Chloe? Miu miu.

16:06.810 --> 16:10.250
Wow. It's like an
archeological dig in here.

16:10.550 --> 16:12.530
I think it's behind the Manolos.

16:13.850 --> 16:14.720
Ooh.

16:14.930 --> 16:16.120
This looks interesting.

16:16.570 --> 16:17.380
You have it?

16:19.160 --> 16:22.590
No, no, but these
Jimmy Choo slingbacks...

16:22.860 --> 16:23.750
They're adorable.

16:24.980 --> 16:26.710
Tell me you didn't get them on sale.

16:29.180 --> 16:30.890
Kitty, can you hear me?

16:31.960 --> 16:33.590
No one was a match.

16:38.460 --> 16:39.220
Oh, God.

16:39.700 --> 16:41.190
What about Ryan? Has he come in?

16:41.360 --> 16:43.420
No, Ryan is AWOL.

16:44.050 --> 16:45.560
But do you really think there's a chance

16:45.730 --> 16:47.390
that a half sibling is gonna be a match

16:47.550 --> 16:50.030
- when none of you guys were? 
- Well, there better be,

16:50.210 --> 16:53.170
or mom's gonna start yanking
bone marrow out of strangers.

16:54.440 --> 16:57.710
Hey, I think I found your letters.

16:59.060 --> 16:59.880
Oh, good.

17:01.080 --> 17:01.900
Thank you.

17:03.570 --> 17:06.359
Lab unit 8 to I.C.U. Lab unit 8...

17:06.540 --> 17:07.460
Senator Mccallister?

17:08.930 --> 17:09.839
Oh, thank God.

17:10.540 --> 17:12.329
Oh, thank you. Thank you so much.

17:12.609 --> 17:15.130
- You need any more help? 
- No, that's it. I really appreciate it.

17:15.720 --> 17:17.349
I'm gonna go take
Kitty down to see Evan.

17:17.510 --> 17:19.020
Thank you. Thank you for doing this.

17:19.339 --> 17:21.150
Doing what? What... what am I doing?

17:21.470 --> 17:23.390
Just a blood test.

17:27.400 --> 17:29.410
Hey. I just spoke with Sarah.

17:29.560 --> 17:30.980
She's, uh, she's on her way with Evan.

17:31.210 --> 17:33.040
It requires more signatures
to get Kitty downstairs

17:33.200 --> 17:34.990
than to get an initiative on the ballot.

17:35.240 --> 17:36.610
I'm gonna talk to
whoever runs this place.

17:36.760 --> 17:38.290
Well, they're just want
to protect their patients.

17:38.400 --> 17:39.590
What are you, their lawyer?

17:39.770 --> 17:41.730
No, I'm... look, I'm on your
side, more than you know.

17:41.900 --> 17:43.440
Oh, and listen, I talked to the L.A.P.D.

17:43.570 --> 17:45.070
They ran the plates on
the guy who's following me.

17:45.220 --> 17:47.380
He's an opposition researcher, okay?

17:47.520 --> 17:49.700
So call Governor Kern
and get him off my ass.

17:50.790 --> 17:52.110
Why don't you just let him follow you?

17:52.880 --> 17:54.510
If he finds something,
we need to know about it.

17:56.940 --> 17:58.830
How would we know about it?
They're not gonna tell us.

18:01.890 --> 18:03.260
Are you telling me he's one of ours?

18:04.770 --> 18:06.310
You hired someone to follow me?

18:06.480 --> 18:08.710
- I had him fired. 
- Why, because he didn't find anything?

18:08.890 --> 18:12.970
- No. Because he did. He has pictures. 
- Of what?

18:13.090 --> 18:14.400
- Of you seeing some woman. 
- A woman?

18:14.580 --> 18:17.760
- Yeah, she lives in Westwood. I've seen the photos, Robert. 
- You are unbelievable.

18:17.910 --> 18:19.650
- So why don't you tell me who she is? 
- Do you really think that I would do that?

18:19.830 --> 18:23.640
- Who is she? 
- Do you really think that I would do that? Answer me.

18:23.780 --> 18:26.370
- No, answer me. My sister is in the hospital while you're... 
- Stay out of my business.

18:26.440 --> 18:27.630
You can't do it, can you?!

18:31.760 --> 18:33.070
Kevin! Robert!

18:33.220 --> 18:34.440
- What are you doing? 
- What are you doing?!

18:34.640 --> 18:36.170
Stop it! Enough! Get up!

18:36.750 --> 18:38.370
Are you crazy? What's wrong with you?

18:40.280 --> 18:43.500
Your son thinks I'm seeing
a woman in Westwood...

18:45.240 --> 18:46.070
And I am.

18:46.280 --> 18:47.740
Twice a week. She's a shrink.

18:49.480 --> 18:51.180
I'm seeing a shrink
because my wife's dying.

18:53.180 --> 18:54.650
There's your opposition research.

19:04.420 --> 19:07.060
You'll be happy to hear I
came with transportation.

19:07.450 --> 19:08.290
Your chariot...

19:08.630 --> 19:12.560
and your box of ultimate mystery.

19:13.830 --> 19:14.850
Did you look in it?

19:15.110 --> 19:18.120
No, I actually resisted for
the first time in my life.

19:18.500 --> 19:20.190
I'm very proud of you, Sarah Walker.

19:20.390 --> 19:23.270
And thank you very
much. Is Evan downstairs?

19:23.420 --> 19:24.100
Just... easy.

19:24.300 --> 19:26.080
Rebecca's just taking
him for a little walk.

19:27.040 --> 19:29.040
The nurse has to take you down, okay?

19:29.430 --> 19:30.330
- Just... easy. 
- No. Why can't you take me down?

19:30.470 --> 19:32.790
- They're just finishing the paperwork. 
- No, no, no one will care.

19:32.980 --> 19:34.210
It'll just be a few minutes.

19:34.370 --> 19:37.360
You know what would be
fun while we're waiting?

19:37.520 --> 19:38.750
Is you could... you could read

19:39.230 --> 19:42.510
- one of these letters out loud to your sister. 
- Nice try.

19:43.340 --> 19:46.580
Sarah, I can't tell you who
he was, because he was famous.

19:46.980 --> 19:47.780
How famous?

19:47.960 --> 19:51.420
Well, he was pretty
darn famous, actually.

19:51.660 --> 19:52.800
It was Bill Clinton, wasn't it?

19:52.960 --> 19:56.610
No, no, but you are
in the right ballpark.

19:57.050 --> 19:59.300
You are freaking me out.
Did you cross the aisle?

19:59.550 --> 20:01.830
He's a match! Ryan is a match.

20:01.990 --> 20:03.360
- Oh, my god. 
- What?

20:03.530 --> 20:05.620
- Ryan is a match. 
- Oh, my god. Did you tell Robert?

20:05.790 --> 20:06.850
No, I came straight here.

20:07.050 --> 20:09.590
He's... he's dealing with
a whole lot of paperwork.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.170
- I'll go get him. 
- Where's Ryan now?

20:11.500 --> 20:12.860
I don'know. I have to call him.

20:13.920 --> 20:16.080
I never thought I would say this,

20:16.280 --> 20:19.010
but I'm so glad your
father cheated on me.

20:19.010 --> 20:21.240
I'll go get Robert.

20:22.680 --> 20:25.210
Mrs. Mccallister, you ready
to go and see your son?

20:25.520 --> 20:26.980
Uh, yes. Yes. Thank you.

20:27.160 --> 20:28.530
- Okay, I'm right behind you. 
- Okay.

20:29.390 --> 20:30.540
Oh, my purse.

20:44.610 --> 20:45.250
Robert.

20:45.880 --> 20:47.890
Robert, Ryan is a match.

20:48.060 --> 20:49.510
- What? 
- Ryan is a match.

20:49.660 --> 20:50.820
- You're kidding. 
- No.

20:54.420 --> 20:56.050
Okay.

20:56.580 --> 20:57.220
What?

20:57.400 --> 20:59.600
Good. No, that's g...
that's good. That's good.

20:59.870 --> 21:00.470
What?

21:04.540 --> 21:05.540
We're really gonna do this?

21:06.780 --> 21:07.920
It's what she wants.

21:08.290 --> 21:09.820
Look, I... I...

21:10.070 --> 21:12.910
I know that we both say
whatever it is we say

21:13.100 --> 21:14.420
when we're in the room with her.

21:15.290 --> 21:17.470
- But this is... this is me and you. 
- Yes.

21:17.660 --> 21:18.020
And I just want to make sure

21:18.170 --> 21:19.540
that we're being real about this.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.480
I mean, maybe she should do more chemo.

21:22.480 --> 21:23.970
Oh, now you sound like me.

21:23.970 --> 21:25.970
Maybe we should wait before...

21:25.970 --> 21:27.270
Robert, listen, this is
her life and her choice,

21:27.450 --> 21:28.550
and we have to respect it.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.690
- I'm scared I'm gonna lose her. 
- I know. I'm scared, too.

21:35.210 --> 21:36.890
I just hope there's more time...

21:39.210 --> 21:40.570
for us to start over.

21:40.840 --> 21:42.020
You have started again.

21:42.390 --> 21:43.460
Do you think she knows that?

21:44.460 --> 21:46.380
I think she does, but it
doesn't hurt to tell her again.

21:49.010 --> 21:50.030
I have to call Ryan.

21:54.410 --> 21:55.550
Just tell me one more time.

21:55.810 --> 21:59.800
So you wrestled Robert to
the ground over a shrink?

21:59.950 --> 22:03.740
- Yeah, he started it. 
- Well, maybe next time he makes a dentist appointment,

22:03.910 --> 22:05.070
you should really kick his ass

22:05.270 --> 22:07.900
- and hurt your little foot next time. 
- Keep it coming. I deserve it.

22:08.090 --> 22:09.630
You know, Sarah, this would
be a lot more fun for me

22:09.800 --> 22:10.780
- if we could gang up on him. 
- What?

22:11.920 --> 22:15.010
- Oh, Kevin, you fight like a girl. 
- What?

22:15.800 --> 22:17.850
I'm sorry. I can't be funny right now.

22:18.120 --> 22:19.790
Look, I know I was being
cautious, but you know what?

22:19.910 --> 22:22.360
- Ryan matched. 
- Right. Now is not the time to lose faith.

22:22.550 --> 22:23.280
It's not that.

22:24.320 --> 22:25.670
I've just got this loop

22:26.480 --> 22:28.210
going around and around in my head,

22:28.520 --> 22:30.680
- and I... I can't get it out. 
- Well, like a good loop?

22:30.910 --> 22:33.490
Well, good enough to distract me
from thinking about bone marrow.

22:35.300 --> 22:37.200
Well, what is it?

22:38.040 --> 22:39.140
I can't tell you.

22:39.920 --> 22:41.330
- Oh... 
- No, I can't. I can't.

22:42.260 --> 22:43.040
I'll just say

22:43.200 --> 22:46.760
that it has nothing to
do with Kitty's health.

22:47.440 --> 22:49.700
- Is it scandalous? 
- Completely.

22:49.870 --> 22:51.960
Okay, Sarah, we all know
how this is gonna end.

22:52.160 --> 22:54.440
- Yeah. 
- All right? So why don't you just spare us and talk?

22:55.970 --> 23:00.490
So Kitty had a dalliance
with this married man.

23:00.680 --> 23:03.860
- Kitty did? 
- A long time ago, when she first got to Washington.

23:04.070 --> 23:04.710
Yeah.

23:05.250 --> 23:06.220
And...

23:06.700 --> 23:07.690
And?

23:07.960 --> 23:12.560
And... he's really very, very famous.

23:13.620 --> 23:13.950
He's...

23:17.120 --> 23:19.480
God have mercy for what I'm about to do.

23:24.010 --> 23:25.400
That's not possible.

23:25.740 --> 23:28.260
- What did she say? What did she say? 
- How... how would you know that?

23:28.600 --> 23:30.270
- There's a box of them. 
- You gotta tell me this. Talk to me.

23:33.180 --> 23:34.670
- Wow. 
- Wow.

23:34.840 --> 23:35.570
Right?

23:43.270 --> 23:45.200
- Ryan. 
- What are you doing here?

23:45.850 --> 23:47.470
- Where are you going? 
- I'm leaving.

23:47.990 --> 23:49.800
Oh, no. No, you can't. Not yet.

23:50.600 --> 23:53.680
- You matched. 
- I don't believe this.

23:53.850 --> 23:54.840
Is someone playing a joke on me?

23:55.020 --> 23:56.980
It's not a joke. You
can save Kitty's life.

23:57.180 --> 23:57.940
I've done some research,

23:58.100 --> 23:59.260
and she's got some other options, okay?

23:59.420 --> 24:00.500
She can try other kinds of chemo.

24:00.680 --> 24:03.760
Please, please. Look, it's
not a big procedure for you.

24:04.050 --> 24:05.810
Honestly, it's... it's
like a needle stick,

24:06.060 --> 24:07.470
a couple of hours, and then you're home.

24:07.910 --> 24:09.410
Take two aspirin, you'll
feel better in the morning.

24:09.630 --> 24:10.500
Use me and be done with me.

24:10.680 --> 24:11.480
Isn't that what you guys like to do?

24:15.100 --> 24:16.770
Ryan, what did we ever do to you?

24:17.260 --> 24:18.990
We... we... we tried
to be a family to you.

24:19.250 --> 24:21.400
I brought you down here. I
invited you to live with me.

24:21.690 --> 24:24.960
Sarah got you a job. Saul
has taken you under his wing.

24:25.120 --> 24:26.470
I'll send you a thank-you
note from the road.

24:27.790 --> 24:30.380
Did we not pay you enough
attention? I'm sorry.

24:30.380 --> 24:31.590
Kitty got sick,

24:31.590 --> 24:32.980
and then Justin's wedding came up and...

24:33.180 --> 24:35.580
- I don't care about the wedding... 
- Is it Rebecca?

24:35.830 --> 24:37.590
Do you still have feelings for Rebecca?

24:37.750 --> 24:39.560
Yeah, that's what this is all
about. I'm in love with Rebecca.

24:39.610 --> 24:41.290
Cut the sarcasm!

24:41.450 --> 24:42.900
Look, it's really sad
what's happening with Kitty,

24:43.220 --> 24:45.970
But I owe you nothing. I am
not a part of your family.

24:46.160 --> 24:49.790
- According to the blood test, Ryan, you are. 
- I'm outta here.

24:51.170 --> 24:53.030
Oh, god. It's William, isn't it?

24:54.750 --> 24:58.000
It's William. I mean,
it didn't make any sense.

24:58.170 --> 25:00.600
How could a nice guy
like you, a good person,

25:00.770 --> 25:01.920
not want to save Kitty's life?

25:02.080 --> 25:03.210
I told you, I don't
want to talk about him.

25:03.400 --> 25:04.310
Then let's talk about Evan.

25:04.530 --> 25:06.850
He's just an innocent little
kid, the same way you were,

25:07.050 --> 25:09.260
and he is the one that will
be most affected by this...

25:09.430 --> 25:10.790
stop. You do not know
what you're talking about.

25:10.970 --> 25:11.240
Yes, I do.

25:11.560 --> 25:13.950
He used my mother and then threw
her out like she was nothing,

25:14.230 --> 25:15.950
and she killed herself because of him.

25:16.090 --> 25:17.580
That's the person that
you were married to.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.120
Ryan...

25:24.030 --> 25:24.910
Don't leave.

25:25.400 --> 25:27.080
This will be the biggest
mistake you ever make.

25:32.670 --> 25:35.060
I heard it was really
hard getting me down here.

25:35.720 --> 25:37.000
Is that all you heard?

25:37.640 --> 25:39.980
Well, that and the fact that my husband

25:40.150 --> 25:42.180
has the chief of police on speed dial.

25:42.750 --> 25:44.570
Well, but isn't that why you married me?

25:45.290 --> 25:47.090
Because I'm... connected?

25:47.360 --> 25:49.400
No, I married you for your looks

25:49.610 --> 25:51.040
and for your cute ass.

25:52.130 --> 25:52.970
Well, that's funny,

25:53.530 --> 25:54.770
Cause it's just why I married you.

25:55.890 --> 25:58.040
Well, you must be having
a lot of regrets now.

25:58.590 --> 26:01.230
No. No regrets.

26:03.220 --> 26:04.460
You?

26:04.670 --> 26:07.600
Well... I'm regretting
this scarf a little bit.

26:11.240 --> 26:12.950
Honey, you're serious, aren't you?

26:13.850 --> 26:15.560
I know it hasn't been
the smoothest road.

26:15.770 --> 26:16.720
Oh, Robert, stop.

26:17.640 --> 26:19.850
Stop. I have no regrets. I love you.

26:20.020 --> 26:22.080
Our... our relationship
is better than ever.

26:25.020 --> 26:25.770
What are you doing?

26:36.720 --> 26:37.790
I adore you.

26:38.220 --> 26:39.420
Robert, you're down on one knee.

26:39.620 --> 26:40.990
We... we... we've already done this.

26:41.160 --> 26:42.610
And I'm doing it again,

26:43.040 --> 26:45.530
because not only do I
not have any regrets,

26:46.980 --> 26:48.590
but I love you more now

26:49.810 --> 26:50.790
than ever before.

26:52.890 --> 26:53.260
Robert...

26:53.430 --> 26:55.120
Just shut up and let
me... let me do this.

26:55.120 --> 26:56.240
Okay.

26:58.910 --> 27:00.450
Will you marry me all over again?

27:04.010 --> 27:06.820
Are... are you doing this
because you think I'm gonna die?

27:07.030 --> 27:08.070
Shh. No, no.

27:09.070 --> 27:12.310
You and I are gonna grow
old and gray together.

27:13.470 --> 27:14.700
Yes, I...

27:15.670 --> 27:17.860
Of course. Of course I'll marry you.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.070
Hey...

27:26.320 --> 27:27.300
Hey!

27:28.160 --> 27:29.250
Look who it is.

27:29.530 --> 27:31.590
Oh, Rebecca, thank you. Thank you.

27:31.760 --> 27:33.410
- Hi, darling. 
- You want to see your mom?

27:33.700 --> 27:36.750
Hi, sweet boy.

27:37.080 --> 27:37.710
- Thank you. 
- I'll be inside if you need anything.

27:37.870 --> 27:40.700
Okay. Thank you so much, Rebecca.

27:42.190 --> 27:47.070
Oh, my sweet, sweet, sweet boy.

27:48.720 --> 27:49.810
Oh, Robert...

27:53.360 --> 27:54.800
What if I never see him again?

27:57.020 --> 27:57.710
You will.

27:59.270 --> 28:00.520
You will. I promise.

28:04.470 --> 28:05.580
Oh, god, I'm scared.

28:06.550 --> 28:07.370
Oh, god.

28:08.180 --> 28:10.380
I didn't know what to
say. I just stood there.

28:10.890 --> 28:12.130
I went there with the intention

28:12.310 --> 28:14.300
of chaining the kid to
the gurney if I had to,

28:14.510 --> 28:16.510
and then he said that about William,

28:16.960 --> 28:18.560
and my god, no wonder he hates us.

28:18.560 --> 28:21.310
Well, that probably explains why
he wanted to sabotage Ojai, right?

28:21.480 --> 28:23.830
I wish there was a law that
could just make him do this.

28:24.970 --> 28:26.230
What am I gonna say to Kitty?

28:26.440 --> 28:29.430
She's about to renew her vows,
for god sakes. I can't tell her.

28:29.610 --> 28:32.120
Well, they should search
the... the bone marrow registry

28:32.300 --> 28:33.840
or your marrow or even my marrow.

28:35.350 --> 28:39.230
- What, Nora? 
- We're too old. That's why.

28:39.460 --> 28:40.040
Nora.

28:41.820 --> 28:42.330
Ryan.

28:42.520 --> 28:46.080
- So, uh, where do I go? 
- You're gonna do it?

28:47.250 --> 28:49.380
I couldn't let another kid
grow up without his mother.

28:49.610 --> 28:51.160
That's great. Okay,
you... you stay right here.

28:51.320 --> 28:53.300
And I'll... I'll... I'll have
them page the doctor. Okay.

28:53.800 --> 28:55.980
Okay. Well, let's go sit down.

28:56.240 --> 28:57.290
- Nora. 
- Yeah?

28:58.610 --> 28:59.790
How did you stop hating him?

29:02.920 --> 29:05.790
I don't know that I
have stopped hating him.

29:06.670 --> 29:07.430
But then...

29:08.490 --> 29:10.170
I haven't stopped loving him either.

29:11.350 --> 29:12.250
Ryan, listen,

29:12.500 --> 29:14.680
You have to surround yourself
with people who care about you,

29:14.840 --> 29:15.760
and then one day, you'll wake up,

29:15.950 --> 29:17.080
and it will just be a distant thought.

29:17.760 --> 29:19.320
It won't consume you anymore.

29:21.200 --> 29:21.990
I promise.

29:24.440 --> 29:28.080
So when you were sleeping with
he who shall not be named...

29:28.240 --> 29:29.270
He wasn't Voldemort.

29:29.460 --> 29:30.870
We'll just call him the Silver Fox.

29:31.540 --> 29:33.670
Do you see what you started, Sarah?

29:33.880 --> 29:36.700
Look, this story will not
leave this family, okay?

29:36.700 --> 29:37.820
Trust me.

29:37.820 --> 29:40.210
Oh, I'm sorry, but I
don't trust any of you.

29:40.440 --> 29:41.410
Okay, and if you don't keep still,

29:41.560 --> 29:42.690
You're gonna look like Lady GaGa.

29:42.960 --> 29:44.960
- I love Lady GaGa. 
- Oh, she's a hack.

29:45.140 --> 29:47.960
- You're a hack. 
- Ooh, burn. What, are you gonna put me in a full nelson now?

29:48.120 --> 29:49.680
Oh, I can't believe I missed that fight.

29:49.840 --> 29:52.760
- Will you... will you do a rematch for me? 
- Anytime, anyplace.

29:52.980 --> 29:55.030
Come on. Can we get back
to the Silver Fox, please?

29:55.190 --> 29:57.440
Oh, I can't believe my
sister's sexual party

29:57.440 --> 29:59.160
is part of our country's history.

29:59.160 --> 30:03.170
- It wasn't all about the sex. That part only lasted a month. 
- Ooh.

30:03.170 --> 30:05.750
I think I was his muse.

30:05.750 --> 30:06.420
- His muse? 
- Oh, muse.

30:06.420 --> 30:09.410
Yes, his muse. I inspired him.

30:09.410 --> 30:11.600
Did he inspire you?

30:11.600 --> 30:13.560
Well, as a matter of fact, he did.

30:13.560 --> 30:16.750
He was the reason I got into
broadcasting and think tanks.

30:16.750 --> 30:17.640
Oh, there you go.

30:17.640 --> 30:19.250
Yeah, I mean, except for,

30:19.250 --> 30:22.140
I went to Washington
to get into politics,

30:22.140 --> 30:24.130
You know, to be in the game.

30:24.130 --> 30:26.590
Ended up in the booth.

30:27.840 --> 30:29.230
You know, it's funny.

30:29.230 --> 30:32.020
Today Robert asked me
if I had any regrets,

30:32.020 --> 30:34.440
and I said no.

30:35.040 --> 30:37.090
But I think maybe I do.

30:37.090 --> 30:38.580
It's never too late, Kit.

30:38.580 --> 30:40.320
Mm. Yeah, yeah, no.

30:40.320 --> 30:43.240
But I probably should...
get married first.

30:43.240 --> 30:46.500
Yeah, not without your diva blush.

30:46.500 --> 30:48.840
- There. Doesn't she look beautiful? 
- She does.

30:48.840 --> 30:50.540
Unh... I'm gonna tell
Robert you're ready.

30:50.540 --> 30:52.890
Okay, I'm gonna go get mama.

30:59.970 --> 31:01.730
Are you sure you're okay with this?

31:01.730 --> 31:04.180
Oh, totally. I... I talked to Robert.

31:04.180 --> 31:06.880
Rebecca and I are... are fine.

31:08.510 --> 31:10.600
How are you?

31:10.600 --> 31:11.830
Are you scared?

31:11.830 --> 31:13.390
Ah.

31:13.390 --> 31:15.930
I mean, we've already done it once.

31:15.930 --> 31:18.970
Not the marriage. The transplant.

31:18.970 --> 31:20.350
Oh.

31:20.350 --> 31:21.900
Oh, well, yeah.

31:21.900 --> 31:23.430
Yeah. No, I'm really scared,

31:23.430 --> 31:26.160
But I... I do believe
it's the right thing to do.

31:27.200 --> 31:30.630
You, on the other hand,
don't look so sure.

31:30.630 --> 31:33.480
No, no, no, no.

31:33.770 --> 31:39.230
Look... we were sworn to
be relentlessly positive.

31:39.230 --> 31:41.220
But...

31:41.220 --> 31:45.100
- You know, it's a major procedure. 
- I know.

31:45.270 --> 31:48.170
Why do you think I'm
getting married again?

31:48.250 --> 31:50.020
I mean, Robert keeps on insisting

31:50.020 --> 31:52.500
that it has nothing to do with
the possibility that I might die...

31:52.500 --> 31:54.320
Oh, kitty, just please don't...

31:54.320 --> 31:56.770
Oh, it is, though, Justin.
It is. Of course it is.

31:56.770 --> 31:58.920
It's okay.

31:59.210 --> 32:01.540
I'm actually grateful

32:01.540 --> 32:04.230
to have something to
focus on other than...

32:06.450 --> 32:08.770
all of this.

32:09.480 --> 32:10.960
I love you.

32:10.960 --> 32:13.490
Love you.

32:14.010 --> 32:14.780
You're gonna be okay.

32:14.780 --> 32:17.220
I know. Don't worry.

32:18.010 --> 32:18.780
All right.

32:18.780 --> 32:21.660
I'll see you in a couple
minutes, all right?

32:22.630 --> 32:25.130
Okay.

32:25.980 --> 32:27.990
You need a hand?

32:28.610 --> 32:30.650
Don't hit me.

32:31.110 --> 32:33.840
I'm so... You'd think I'd
never done this before...

32:33.840 --> 32:35.140
I mean, getting married.

32:35.140 --> 32:37.710
They say three's the charm. May I?

32:39.450 --> 32:41.120
There you go.

32:41.120 --> 32:43.860
Not bad for a guy with a sprained wrist.

32:45.180 --> 32:47.320
- Look, I owe you an apology... 
- Yeah, screw it.

32:47.320 --> 32:50.440
- You know, we were both under pressure. 
- Yeah, which is when people show their true colors,

32:50.440 --> 32:52.420
that's... that's why I didn't trust you,

32:52.420 --> 32:54.590
because if I were in your position,

32:54.590 --> 32:56.920
- I don't know what I would've done. 
- You kidding me?

32:56.920 --> 32:58.570
You took a swing at a guy
that could kick your ass

32:58.570 --> 33:00.120
defending your sister's honor.

33:00.120 --> 33:05.980
- You're capable of anything. 
- You know, I still think that fight was pretty even.

33:31.280 --> 33:33.030
Kitty, repeat after me.

33:33.030 --> 33:36.210
I, Kitty, take you,
Robert, to be my husband.

33:36.210 --> 33:40.420
I, Kitty, take you,
Robert, to be my husband...

33:40.420 --> 33:42.490
again.

33:49.960 --> 33:54.870
I, Robert, take you,
Kitty, to be my wife again

33:58.110 --> 34:01.400
To have and to hold
from this day forward...

34:01.740 --> 34:06.460
To have and to hold
from this day forward...

34:08.500 --> 34:11.300
For better or worse...

34:12.290 --> 34:15.940
For better or for worse...

34:19.190 --> 34:21.810
For richer or poorer...

34:22.290 --> 34:25.670
For richer or poorer...

34:29.679 --> 34:31.870
In sickness and in health...

34:31.870 --> 34:34.880
In sickness and in health...

34:38.989 --> 34:41.909
To love and to cherish...

34:43.350 --> 34:46.150
To love and to cherish...

34:46.650 --> 34:49.960
Till death do us part.

34:50.010 --> 34:52.940
Till death do us part.

35:04.840 --> 35:06.350
Nora.

35:06.350 --> 35:08.040
Oh, God. How is she?

35:08.040 --> 35:09.550
She's sleeping.

35:09.550 --> 35:11.010
We made it over the first hurdle.

35:11.010 --> 35:13.770
- She's accepted the transplant. 
- Thank god.

35:13.770 --> 35:17.000
Okay. Good. So... so...
so what happens next?

35:17.000 --> 35:19.690
Well, we wait.

35:37.050 --> 35:39.430
Good afternoon.

35:40.320 --> 35:41.560
This is one of the most difficult things

35:41.560 --> 35:43.650
I've ever had to do.

35:45.130 --> 35:47.760
Let me start by telling
you a little bit about

35:47.760 --> 35:51.210
the love of my life...
Kitty Walker Mccallister.

35:52.570 --> 35:54.530
As many of you know, earlier this year,

35:54.530 --> 35:58.320
She was diagnosed with
Stage III lymphoma.

35:58.350 --> 36:00.420
After several rounds of chemotherapy,

36:00.420 --> 36:04.570
she underwent a grueling
bone marrow transplant.

36:04.570 --> 36:07.220
And based on her latest tests,

36:07.220 --> 36:09.520
I can tell you that
she has beaten the odds,

36:09.520 --> 36:12.530
- And she is in remission. 
- Yay.

36:13.490 --> 36:15.620
So sorry we're late. Look who I have.

36:15.620 --> 36:17.510
Oh, Ryan. Just in time.  Hi.

36:17.510 --> 36:21.070
Come on, Ryan. Take a
bow. My hero. Take a bow.

36:21.620 --> 36:24.560
From the start, Kitty has inspired me

36:24.560 --> 36:27.630
with her strength, grace,

36:27.630 --> 36:29.060
courage and sense of humor.

36:29.060 --> 36:31.120
- Wait. Who is he talking about? 
- Oh...

36:31.120 --> 36:33.020
And at the beginning of
this difficult journey,

36:33.020 --> 36:34.330
both Kitty and I insisted that,

36:34.330 --> 36:36.280
while we had a tough fight at home,

36:36.280 --> 36:38.970
we also had an equally
important fight here

36:38.970 --> 36:41.180
in the effort to become your governor

36:41.180 --> 36:45.080
and to bring this amazing
state into remission as well.

36:45.080 --> 36:47.860
- Nice metaphor. 
- Oh, I think it's beautiful.

36:47.860 --> 36:51.090
- I think I just lost my place as
favorite son-in-law.  - Definitely.

36:51.090 --> 36:53.820
So many of us go through our days

36:53.950 --> 36:57.230
so focused on the goal ahead of us

36:57.230 --> 37:00.570
that we forget what's
important is right next to us.

37:01.260 --> 37:03.480
I almost lost my partner,

37:03.480 --> 37:05.870
my better half.

37:06.460 --> 37:10.300
And... it reminded me

37:10.340 --> 37:12.080
that my responsibility,

37:12.080 --> 37:15.040
first and foremost, is to my family.

37:15.560 --> 37:17.140
And I have discovered

37:17.140 --> 37:19.710
that I cannot equally honor

37:19.710 --> 37:23.350
my responsibilities to my
constituents as a senator,

37:23.350 --> 37:26.330
my supporters in this campaign

37:26.330 --> 37:29.220
and my loved ones with equal measure.

37:29.380 --> 37:31.080
And so...

37:31.080 --> 37:33.530
in service to the state of California,

37:33.530 --> 37:35.530
the Republican Party

37:35.530 --> 37:37.750
and family,

37:37.850 --> 37:39.990
I today withdraw my bid for governor.

37:39.990 --> 37:42.220
Senator Mccallister!

37:42.220 --> 37:45.080
What?

37:46.350 --> 37:48.080
What?

37:48.080 --> 37:51.760
Well, I... I told you that
you wouldn't want to miss it.

38:01.880 --> 38:04.090
Oh, what a great fire.

38:04.090 --> 38:05.600
Yeah.

38:05.600 --> 38:06.730
Yeah, all we need

38:06.730 --> 38:10.240
is some marshmallows and
graham crackers and chocolate.

38:10.240 --> 38:11.960
Oh, I think I have all of those.

38:11.960 --> 38:14.040
Mom... I'm kidding.

38:14.040 --> 38:15.220
Oh.

38:15.220 --> 38:17.980
It's perfect. I don't need anything.

38:18.690 --> 38:20.480
And isn't that amazing?

38:20.480 --> 38:22.300
Yeah.

38:22.300 --> 38:25.070
Yeah, isn't it amazing?

38:25.210 --> 38:27.740
I can't even believe it.

38:29.180 --> 38:32.670
I'm gonna get to see
him go to preschool.

38:33.430 --> 38:34.810
Yeah.

38:34.810 --> 38:38.670
Preschool and the eighth grade,

38:38.670 --> 38:40.760
the 11th grade,

38:40.760 --> 38:42.840
and I'm warning you,
it ain't all pretty.

38:42.840 --> 38:45.680
Yes, it is, mom. It's all pretty.

38:46.670 --> 38:48.080
Oh, God.

38:48.080 --> 38:51.950
God, It sound like one of
those annoying people who...

38:51.950 --> 38:53.650
get a second lease on life,

38:53.650 --> 38:56.390
and suddenly, everything is amazing.

38:57.610 --> 38:59.760
This is the best fire,

38:59.760 --> 39:02.740
this is the best tea,

39:02.740 --> 39:05.800
and you are the best mother.

39:05.800 --> 39:07.560
What? That doesn't sound annoying.

39:07.560 --> 39:09.860
It sounds very accurate.

39:09.860 --> 39:12.530
What are you gonna do
with this second chance,

39:12.530 --> 39:14.670
this new lease on life?

39:14.670 --> 39:18.350
I don't know, but I'm certainly
not gonna waste my time.

39:18.910 --> 39:21.640
And, you know, there are just so...

39:21.640 --> 39:24.270
so many things I want to do.

39:24.860 --> 39:27.590
Sometimes when I look at
other people and their lives

39:27.590 --> 39:30.520
and everything they've accomplished

39:30.520 --> 39:32.800
and... I haven't,

39:33.000 --> 39:36.060
and then I... I look at one of my kids,

39:36.060 --> 39:40.200
and I know not a single
day has been wasted...

39:40.200 --> 39:44.160
and what's important are
all the days still to come.

39:45.810 --> 39:48.760
Yeah.

39:52.400 --> 39:54.050
Ooh.

39:54.050 --> 39:56.540
Are those the infamous letters?

39:56.560 --> 39:59.020
Of course. Of course they told you.

39:59.020 --> 40:01.010
Yes, but they refused to
tell me who wrote them.

40:01.010 --> 40:04.330
- But I will get it out of them eventually. 
- I'm sure you will.

40:04.330 --> 40:06.010
What are you gonna do with 'em?

40:06.010 --> 40:07.830
I don't know. I don't know.

40:07.830 --> 40:10.290
You know, it... it's funny,

40:10.290 --> 40:14.820
because they're not at all
what I remember them to be.

40:16.250 --> 40:18.260
I don't know. I was so young,

40:18.260 --> 40:21.450
and it's like they were
written about somebody else.

40:27.060 --> 40:29.790
So let's go to bed.

40:29.790 --> 40:34.070
Yeah, you know, I think I'm
gonna wait up for Robert.

40:34.820 --> 40:37.800
Good night.
