01:37.179 --> 01:39.307
Your help means a lot to us, Bruce.

01:39.390 --> 01:41.892
And what you do
means a lot to this city.

01:42.268 --> 01:43.686
I wish we could do more.

01:46.022 --> 01:48.316
Lately, things haven't been going well.

01:49.150 --> 01:50.776
Thanks. What do you mean?

01:51.319 --> 01:54.739
I can't prove it, but I'm positive,
people are disappearing.

01:54.822 --> 01:58.492
Transients, regulars,
old faces I miss seeing.

01:58.576 --> 02:02.163
Then a month ago, a volunteer,
Dan Riley, disappeared.

02:02.246 --> 02:04.332
I'm telling you, something's very wrong.

02:04.415 --> 02:06.542
- You've talked to the police?
- Of course.

02:06.626 --> 02:08.669
But the police have their hands full.

02:08.753 --> 02:11.464
And homeless people disappearing
is not big news.

03:53.023 --> 03:55.234
Hey, buddy, you looking for a job?

03:55.776 --> 03:58.404
Maybe. What kind of job?

03:58.487 --> 04:02.116
Oh, you'll like it.
It's long-term employment.

04:58.798 --> 05:00.007
Hey, Riley.

05:13.979 --> 05:15.439
Oh, boy.

05:17.358 --> 05:19.610
- Hey, stranger.
- You okay?

05:20.986 --> 05:23.739
I think so. Where am I?

05:24.031 --> 05:27.785
Well, opinions differ, but we all agree.
It ain't Miami.

05:28.494 --> 05:31.747
Don't mind him.
Every chain gang has a comedian.

05:32.039 --> 05:34.500
I'm Dan Riley, and he's Salvo Smith.

05:35.125 --> 05:36.669
So, what's your name, pal?

05:37.753 --> 05:40.297
I don't know.

05:57.481 --> 05:58.774
What is this?

05:59.024 --> 06:02.653
If it's moving, it's a rat.
If not, it's a cooked rat.

06:03.320 --> 06:06.115
Why aren't these Iowlifes working?

06:06.740 --> 06:07.783
They have to eat, sir.

06:09.910 --> 06:12.997
I have to eat. They have to work.

06:13.581 --> 06:16.792
From now on, they'll bring me
twice the gold ore.

06:17.084 --> 06:19.044
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.

06:19.295 --> 06:20.963
We recruited some new men.

06:22.715 --> 06:25.634
You bums better start busting butt

06:25.718 --> 06:29.138
or you'll all end up like him.

06:34.768 --> 06:36.437
No! Please!

06:36.687 --> 06:39.815
I ain't done nothing! No! Please!

06:42.610 --> 06:43.736
Please!

06:44.194 --> 06:45.404
Please!

06:47.948 --> 06:49.241
Please!

06:57.124 --> 07:02.046
Now get to work, or you'll all roast.

07:14.391 --> 07:15.643
Rise and shine.

07:16.143 --> 07:17.811
It's a beautiful...

07:18.729 --> 07:19.897
That's odd.

07:20.147 --> 07:23.776
Only vampires loathe daylight
more than Batman.

07:24.193 --> 07:25.736
I wonder what's keeping him.

07:50.469 --> 07:53.263
- How you holding up?
- Okay, I guess.

07:54.348 --> 07:55.641
Remember anything yet?

07:56.892 --> 07:58.769
I'm beginning to wonder if I ever will.

07:59.728 --> 08:01.480
Hey, you can't give up hope.

08:01.563 --> 08:03.649
Down here it's all we've got
to hang on to.

08:04.149 --> 08:07.403
I guess you're right.
So, what brought you guys here?

08:07.820 --> 08:12.491
I was one of Gotham City's unemployed.
Now I got a job. Lucky me.

08:12.658 --> 08:15.828
I was a steamfitter
at the Gotham Navy Yard.

08:15.995 --> 08:19.456
Two nights a week, I did volunteer work
at the Dock Street Rescue Mission.

08:20.040 --> 08:22.835
One night I was getting into my car,
and three guys jumped me.

08:23.252 --> 08:24.837
I wound up here.

08:25.087 --> 08:27.881
My family must be
going out of their minds.

08:29.591 --> 08:31.260
Rescue Mission.

08:34.805 --> 08:36.181
Cave-in!

08:53.907 --> 08:55.534
Ah, are you okay?

08:58.620 --> 08:59.830
Where's Salvo?

09:00.039 --> 09:02.124
I'm over here, taking five.

09:03.625 --> 09:05.461
Hang on, man. We'll get you out.

09:05.544 --> 09:08.630
Take your time.
It's the first break I've had all day.

09:10.174 --> 09:11.759
Does this sort of thing happen often?

09:12.384 --> 09:13.385
Too often.

09:17.264 --> 09:20.601
No, I'm sorry, sir.
Mr. Wayne was called out of town.

09:21.018 --> 09:23.937
If you call back on Friday...

09:38.410 --> 09:40.037
The Studebaker's gone.

09:40.370 --> 09:42.331
I'd better activate the tracking device.

09:47.377 --> 09:48.670
The Bowery.

10:57.614 --> 11:01.076
Dock Street Rescue Mission.

11:06.915 --> 11:10.377
I've never seen such lazy scum.

11:18.635 --> 11:21.388
Now that was real funny.

11:22.306 --> 11:23.932
Throw him in the box!

11:26.685 --> 11:28.478
You can't. It'll kill him.

11:28.687 --> 11:33.734
That's the idea. Now do it!

11:41.408 --> 11:43.660
I got him! Come on!

12:08.185 --> 12:12.189
We'll see how they like the oven.

12:56.024 --> 12:58.026
Hey, you really cleaned their clocks.

12:58.777 --> 13:00.570
You did pretty good yourself.

13:01.154 --> 13:03.824
Well, maybe you used to be
some kind of fighter.

13:04.116 --> 13:05.784
I don't know.

13:06.368 --> 13:08.662
I just don't know.

13:15.961 --> 13:20.716
My son, he's gonna be six on April 7th.

13:21.466 --> 13:24.803
Or seven on April 6.

13:25.637 --> 13:27.597
Oh, what's it matter?
I'll never see him again.

13:28.223 --> 13:29.641
Hang on, Riley.

13:30.183 --> 13:31.435
We'll make it.

13:31.935 --> 13:35.439
Remember what you told me?
You can't lose hope.

13:36.231 --> 13:38.108
I can't take it anymore!

13:39.067 --> 13:40.360
I lost my family! My family!

13:40.444 --> 13:44.781
My family! My family! My family!
My family!

14:12.642 --> 14:16.855
Riley, you've got to pull it together.
We're getting out of here.

14:18.315 --> 14:19.441
Yeah, right.

14:19.816 --> 14:21.276
You're the one who's losing it.

14:38.335 --> 14:40.587
Stop him!

14:41.296 --> 14:45.550
Stop him,
or you'll all rot in the mines!

14:49.471 --> 14:50.639
There he is.

14:51.139 --> 14:52.432
We got him now.

14:52.516 --> 14:54.393
He's gone into Box Canyon.

14:54.726 --> 14:56.311
There's no way out.

15:38.061 --> 15:39.771
Look! Up there!

15:56.288 --> 15:57.706
Whoa!

16:02.586 --> 16:04.129
Oh! Whoa!

16:12.554 --> 16:15.932
This must be the place. Bring us down.

16:16.099 --> 16:17.184
<i>Negative.</i>

16:17.267 --> 16:20.187
But Master Bruce is down here.
We have to land.

16:20.437 --> 16:22.647
<i>Impossible. Area too confined.</i>

16:23.106 --> 16:25.609
Land, you bucket of bolts.

16:26.109 --> 16:27.319
<i>Your funeral.</i>

16:27.527 --> 16:29.029
Oh, dear.

16:34.284 --> 16:35.660
Get us down!

16:37.370 --> 16:39.331
<i>Caution. Rocks.</i>

16:48.006 --> 16:49.925
Son of a gun.

17:03.146 --> 17:04.648
<i>Watch your step.</i>

17:06.775 --> 17:11.821
I... I... I claim this land for Spain.

17:20.247 --> 17:21.665
Master Bruce.

17:28.672 --> 17:30.298
Hurry up with that gravy!

17:32.842 --> 17:37.430
If those fools let that prisoner escape,
I'II eat them alive.

17:39.599 --> 17:41.268
A bat! A giant bat!

17:41.518 --> 17:42.811
Horrible!

17:43.812 --> 17:45.730
What are you babbling about?

17:45.939 --> 17:47.148
What bat?

17:47.524 --> 17:48.942
Right here.

17:49.526 --> 17:50.735
There it is!

17:52.112 --> 17:53.613
Batman!

18:07.627 --> 18:08.628
Shoot him!

18:13.258 --> 18:15.635
After him, you fools!

18:19.472 --> 18:21.308
<i>After him!</i>

18:21.975 --> 18:26.229
$1,000 to the man who bags that bat.

18:37.157 --> 18:38.199
There he is!

18:38.950 --> 18:41.870
Split up and fan out.

18:55.425 --> 18:56.885
Huh?

19:01.765 --> 19:02.807
Huh?

19:07.937 --> 19:09.356
Kill the lights!

19:10.023 --> 19:13.360
We'll find out if this bat
can see in the dark.

19:28.792 --> 19:29.959
Look out!

19:34.547 --> 19:35.965
I think he went this way.

19:36.716 --> 19:38.635
Pete, where are...

19:39.469 --> 19:41.096
Help!

19:42.389 --> 19:44.432
Help!

19:45.141 --> 19:48.353
Hodges, Kurt, Howard! Are you okay?

19:48.645 --> 19:50.188
Not exactly.

19:53.483 --> 19:54.734
Stop him!

20:19.592 --> 20:21.594
No! Leave me alone!

20:28.309 --> 20:30.145
We've got to get out of here.

20:30.353 --> 20:33.064
Stop. We'll be killed.

20:33.523 --> 20:35.984
Stop, and we will be.

21:02.927 --> 21:05.722
Don't let me drown!

21:08.850 --> 21:11.936
When you taste the prison food,
you'll wish I had.

21:13.062 --> 21:14.105
It's no palace,

21:14.189 --> 21:16.983
but you're welcome to stay at our place
until you get back on your feet.

21:17.108 --> 21:20.612
Thanks, Riley. Maybe this time,
we can find some work that pays.

21:23.198 --> 21:25.658
You know, pal, it'll be tight,
but you're welcome too.

21:25.909 --> 21:27.035
Thanks, but I...

21:27.118 --> 21:28.912
<i>Are we ready, Master Bruce?</i>

21:31.372 --> 21:32.916
Master Bruce?

21:33.082 --> 21:35.877
Bruce Wayne. WayneTech Enterprises.

21:36.753 --> 21:39.547
If you'd like a job,
I can probably help.

21:41.633 --> 21:42.634
Hit me, Riley.

21:42.801 --> 21:43.885
Hit you? Why?

21:44.093 --> 21:46.888
Maybe I'll lose my memory
and wake up a millionaire too.

22:20.839 --> 22:21.840
