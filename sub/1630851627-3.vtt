WEBVTT

00:15.181 --> 00:16.558
[Cas] Why would they do that?

00:17.142 --> 00:18.018
They jumped!

00:18.101 --> 00:20.353
-Either of us would've made the same call.
-I wouldn't.

00:20.437 --> 00:22.772
-Not without you.
-And look where that got you!

00:23.732 --> 00:26.526
-We need to get the fuck off this ring!
-[energy whooshing]

00:26.609 --> 00:29.696
-What happened back there?
-[sobs]

00:29.779 --> 00:32.615
I saw my mom and Erik and Jana.

00:32.699 --> 00:34.367
What? On Earth?

00:34.451 --> 00:35.577
We have got to go.

00:37.912 --> 00:39.914
[screaming]

00:44.127 --> 00:45.712
[birdsong]

00:45.795 --> 00:47.338
[murmur of voices]

00:47.422 --> 00:48.256
Niko?

00:50.050 --> 00:51.134
[seabirds calling]

00:51.217 --> 00:52.052
[Cas] Niko?

00:56.056 --> 00:58.058
[breathes deeply]

00:58.141 --> 01:00.685
[gasping] Cas. Cas!

01:02.020 --> 01:02.854
Cas!

01:03.521 --> 01:05.565
-[high-pitched shrieking]
-No!

01:06.191 --> 01:07.317
[yelps]

01:07.400 --> 01:08.401
[groans]

01:13.156 --> 01:15.533
Looks like all your friends
have abandoned you.

01:15.617 --> 01:17.535
Where is Cas? Where'd you take her?

01:17.619 --> 01:22.207
It's sad. After everything you've done
for them, I'm all you have left.

01:22.290 --> 01:24.334
Leave Cas out of the negotiations.

01:26.419 --> 01:28.797
We're done negotiating, sweetheart.

01:29.506 --> 01:32.092
Don't worry. We're not gonna harm Cas.

01:32.592 --> 01:34.928
In fact, we're gonna give her
everything she's ever wanted.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.932
[seabirds calling]

01:41.643 --> 01:43.394
[child laughing]

01:46.773 --> 01:48.233
Are you going surfing?

01:49.150 --> 01:49.984
Surfing?

01:50.485 --> 01:51.319
Your wetsuit.

01:53.238 --> 01:55.156
Oh, no, this isn't a wetsuit. It's--

01:58.535 --> 02:00.954
-Where are we?
-I think you lost this.

02:11.673 --> 02:12.549
[man] Cas.

02:17.053 --> 02:17.887
Anthony?

02:18.847 --> 02:20.014
It's crazy, right?

02:21.015 --> 02:22.809
This-- This is a trick. You're a trick.

02:23.309 --> 02:24.769
No. Stop fucking with my head!

02:24.853 --> 02:26.354
It's me!

02:26.437 --> 02:29.566
I'm here. I'm really here.
Just like that's Mrs. Bear.

02:31.860 --> 02:33.903
-My brother died.
-I'm back.

02:34.571 --> 02:35.655
Just like the rest of it.

02:37.282 --> 02:38.700
What are you talking about?

02:39.200 --> 02:42.078
Look around.
Where do you think you are right now?

02:43.037 --> 02:46.374
Oh, shit. That's right.
You… you were away when it happened.

02:47.125 --> 02:48.626
Cas, it's our Water City.

02:48.710 --> 02:49.752
Or it was.

02:52.046 --> 02:52.964
They fixed it.

02:53.882 --> 02:56.426
The Achaia fixed everything, Cas.

02:57.302 --> 02:58.136
Yeah.

03:01.598 --> 03:05.351
Your mind tricks didn't work on me.
They're not gonna work on Cas.

03:05.435 --> 03:08.897
The difference between you and Cas,
vulnerability.

03:09.522 --> 03:12.609
She has an open heart.
Frankly, you could learn a bit from her.

03:12.692 --> 03:15.778
You're full of shit.
She's gonna see right through it.

03:15.862 --> 03:17.947
We have our work cut out for us, true.

03:18.531 --> 03:19.866
But I remain hopeful.

03:20.366 --> 03:22.118
[bubbling sound]

03:23.953 --> 03:25.246
You're spooling up the FTL.

03:25.330 --> 03:26.331
Clever girl.

03:26.414 --> 03:29.417
Your half-breed AI threw a wrench
into our systems.

03:29.500 --> 03:32.545
-Gave them a head start.
-You're going after the Salvare.

03:33.254 --> 03:34.297
Bingo.

03:52.440 --> 03:53.775
[groans]

03:55.818 --> 03:56.861
Okay.

04:00.949 --> 04:03.159
Jana wanted to read a bit by herself.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.495
-[both sigh]
-Told her, "Lights out in ten."

04:05.578 --> 04:07.914
Yeah. No, hey, thanks for coming.

04:07.997 --> 04:09.916
It's really good for her.

04:09.999 --> 04:12.543
A little bit of normal
after all the crazy.

04:15.588 --> 04:16.798
I could've come sooner.

04:17.590 --> 04:18.424
So…

04:19.550 --> 04:21.678
-Well, I was handling things.
-[Ava chuckles]

04:22.178 --> 04:24.222
-You were handling things?
-Yep.

04:26.140 --> 04:30.812
Was that before or after you left her
in the hands of an alien oncologist?

04:31.479 --> 04:32.689
After I what?

04:32.772 --> 04:35.817
You have no idea what they might have
done to her in there.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.026
[laughs]

04:37.110 --> 04:39.195
Ava, I'm sorry, but--

04:39.279 --> 04:42.949
but does-- does Jana seem okay to you?

04:43.032 --> 04:46.911
This isn't some kind of goddamn
scientific experiment, Erik.

04:46.995 --> 04:49.038
This is my granddaughter's life!

04:49.122 --> 04:50.373
They saved her life.

04:50.456 --> 04:53.501
Her life should never have been in danger
in the first place.

04:57.880 --> 04:59.549
-I'm sorry.
-[sighs]

05:00.466 --> 05:01.968
I'm sorry. Uh…

05:02.468 --> 05:03.469
That was unfair.

05:04.470 --> 05:06.055
It's just that… [sighs]

05:07.181 --> 05:10.893
I have never been able
to… talk sense into Niko.

05:11.644 --> 05:13.146
And that's my fault.

05:13.229 --> 05:16.107
But you… Erik, you're the rational one.

05:16.190 --> 05:18.401
You're the one
with his feet on the ground.

05:18.484 --> 05:22.196
I am trying the best that I can, Ava.

05:24.115 --> 05:24.949
I know.

05:28.244 --> 05:30.121
I just can't lose her too.

05:31.539 --> 05:33.124
You haven't lost anyone.

05:36.377 --> 05:37.503
[sighing] I…

05:38.671 --> 05:39.714
[taps table]

05:40.798 --> 05:42.342
Why don't you get some rest?

05:43.634 --> 05:45.720
I'll take Jana to school in the morning.

05:46.220 --> 05:48.097
I'd actually really like to do that.

05:48.181 --> 05:51.726
I will. I-- I just--
I got some work to finish up first. So…

05:51.809 --> 05:52.810
-Okay.

05:53.353 --> 05:54.187
Thank you.

06:09.202 --> 06:12.038
I'm pickin' up a gravitational wave
in the fabric of space-time

06:12.121 --> 06:13.498
behind our current position.

06:13.581 --> 06:16.042
Safe to assume one or all
of the Achaian rings are pursuing us?

06:16.542 --> 06:19.837
[sighs] As long as we stay in FTL,
they can't attack us.

06:19.921 --> 06:20.963
And Niko and Cas?

06:22.090 --> 06:24.217
They have a chance. Don't count them out.

06:25.885 --> 06:27.053
Thank you, Iara.

06:29.180 --> 06:31.599
Meet me in Soma. Need more hands on deck.

06:37.313 --> 06:38.272
I'm confused.

06:38.356 --> 06:40.775
Why are we waking a member of team three

06:40.858 --> 06:43.945
when we have a more qualified engineer
available in team two?

06:44.028 --> 06:46.447
-Ivan Winfree--
-Has no field experience.

06:47.698 --> 06:51.411
[sighs] Dillon Conner,
former combat engineer, special forces.

06:51.994 --> 06:55.164
He lost his left leg from below the knee
in the Venezuela Cartel Wars.

06:55.248 --> 06:58.584
Yes. But Ivan graduated top of his class
at the Academy.

06:58.668 --> 07:00.545
-Unlike your guy, who--
-I'm sorry?

07:01.129 --> 07:01.963
My guy?

07:02.463 --> 07:05.299
I'm just saying,
Niko would consider all relevant data

07:05.383 --> 07:07.176
-before making a decision.
-I am.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.178
And what I'm seeing is that, once again,

07:09.262 --> 07:11.305
you'd have us wake someone
not qualified for the job.

07:13.057 --> 07:14.725
My guy cleared a harbor of IEDs

07:14.809 --> 07:17.019
while impact grenades fell on him
like rain.

07:18.062 --> 07:19.772
-[door opens]
-Screw report cards.

07:19.856 --> 07:21.357
[groaning]

07:21.858 --> 07:25.069
Well, hot damn, Ricky. [grunts]

07:25.153 --> 07:29.198
We're either at Pi Canis Majoris
or things are officially FUBAR.

07:30.032 --> 07:32.118
-Sorry to say, it's the second one.
-[sighs]

07:32.785 --> 07:34.871
This is William. He's a holo.

07:35.371 --> 07:37.290
-[sighs]
-Don't try using him as a crutch.

07:37.373 --> 07:38.332
[chuckles]

07:38.416 --> 07:41.878
Someone gonna get my leg from storage?
Or are you gonna give me a piggyback?

07:44.505 --> 07:45.590
No piggyback?

07:47.508 --> 07:48.509
What was your name again?

07:49.343 --> 07:50.178
William.

07:50.928 --> 07:53.014
-[whirring]
-[holo appears]

07:53.097 --> 07:55.433
[Iara] If you're trying
to sabotage the ship,

07:55.516 --> 07:58.519
you're gonna need
a much better plan than this.

07:58.603 --> 08:01.689
I'm trying to make faster than light
travel even faster. [sighs]

08:01.772 --> 08:04.609
So, if you know how
to break the laws of physics,

08:04.692 --> 08:06.986
please, speak up.

08:07.820 --> 08:08.905
[gasps]

08:09.614 --> 08:10.698
You're in pain.

08:11.199 --> 08:12.533
Yeah. [sighs]

08:12.617 --> 08:15.661
Like a thousand pins and needles
stabbing up and down my leg.

08:17.246 --> 08:18.206
[sighs]

08:19.248 --> 08:20.416
That doesn't mean much to you.

08:21.083 --> 08:22.168
I'd like a body.

08:22.251 --> 08:25.588
And I'd like to be able
to pop in and out of places with my mind.

08:26.172 --> 08:27.298
Like the Salvare?

08:27.381 --> 08:30.510
-You went over to the Achaian ship.
-And got attacked.

08:30.593 --> 08:32.887
Yeah. You don't need a body to feel pain.

08:32.970 --> 08:34.555
[tool whirring]

08:39.852 --> 08:40.686
I get it.

08:44.315 --> 08:48.819
Can't you use your neural pathways
to… conjure up other environments?

08:50.404 --> 08:52.740
I don't know.
Mount Everest, rings of Saturn.

08:53.491 --> 08:58.037
I can, but… it's not exactly fun
traveling alone.

09:05.127 --> 09:06.963
Stop. What are you doing?

09:08.130 --> 09:10.967
-Maybe you don't have to be so alone.
-You need to put those back on.

09:11.050 --> 09:12.593
-It's dangerous.
-I trust you.

09:14.053 --> 09:14.887
I trust you.

09:24.272 --> 09:25.856
[buzzing hum]

09:31.028 --> 09:32.530
Whoa. I can feel you.

09:32.613 --> 09:35.283
-Not really, but…
-But it's close enough.

09:35.366 --> 09:36.659
Close enough.

09:38.327 --> 09:39.453
[gasps]

09:41.122 --> 09:43.207
[Cas] I need to find a-- a computer.

09:43.291 --> 09:47.211
Or-- or a phone. Or a car.
I need to tell USIC that we're alive.

09:47.295 --> 09:50.923
-Wait. Hold on. I could tell--
-Hey! Hey! Don't touch me.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.510
I can take you to all those things.

09:56.762 --> 09:57.805
What do you think I am?

09:59.974 --> 10:01.309
I really don't know.

10:03.603 --> 10:04.812
What do you think that is?

10:07.440 --> 10:08.858
Grandma made it for you.

10:09.358 --> 10:11.277
Said you deserved something soft.

10:11.360 --> 10:12.236
[chuckles]

10:12.737 --> 10:15.114
Then your jerk of a brother
tied a parachute to it

10:15.197 --> 10:16.657
and dropped it in the canal.

10:17.158 --> 10:18.326
Bye-bye, Mrs. Bear.

10:18.409 --> 10:20.202
That was 17 years ago.

10:21.454 --> 10:22.788
So there's a remnant.

10:23.414 --> 10:25.541
Whatever the Achaia do
to revitalize a place

10:25.625 --> 10:27.001
can't catch everything.

10:27.585 --> 10:28.836
Is that what you are?

10:30.129 --> 10:30.963
A remnant?

10:31.047 --> 10:34.759
I ended up in the canal, too,
but my body was never found.

10:34.842 --> 10:36.302
Trust me. I remember.

10:36.385 --> 10:39.680
So when the Achaia
brought our Water City back to life,

10:39.764 --> 10:40.973
I guess I just…

10:41.474 --> 10:43.601
Just… I just came along for the ride.

10:43.684 --> 10:45.728
Shit. I ain't complaining. [laughs]

10:48.731 --> 10:49.732
So this is real?

10:52.318 --> 10:53.486
You're really him?

10:54.070 --> 10:55.071
Yes, Cas.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.365
It's all thanks to the Achaia.

11:01.577 --> 11:03.287
[Niko, muffled] Cas, do you copy?

11:04.914 --> 11:05.998
Did you hear that?

11:06.499 --> 11:07.792
All I hear are the seagulls.

11:07.875 --> 11:09.418
Cas, it's Niko.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.212
[gasping] Do you read me?

11:12.380 --> 11:13.506
Cas, do you copy?

11:13.589 --> 11:14.799
Niko, where are you?

11:16.842 --> 11:18.469
No. No. No.

11:18.969 --> 11:21.847
-None of this is fucking real.
-Okay. You're right.

11:23.808 --> 11:24.850
But it could be.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.647
Whoever they have you talking to,

11:30.481 --> 11:31.691
it's not real.

11:31.774 --> 11:34.151
You really are exhausting, my dear.

11:35.277 --> 11:36.487
Cas, do you hear me?

11:37.196 --> 11:38.364
Resist them, Cas.

11:40.032 --> 11:42.535
Whatever you do, don't give in to--

11:42.618 --> 11:44.120
[power shutting off]

11:44.203 --> 11:45.705
[Niko gasping]

11:46.706 --> 11:48.708
Now you'll have to talk to me.

11:48.791 --> 11:50.918
Niko, where are you?

11:51.001 --> 11:51.836
Cas.

11:53.170 --> 11:54.004
Over there.

11:57.383 --> 12:00.886
Welcome, friends. Family, really,

12:02.096 --> 12:05.266
as we celebrate Zayn Petrossian
and Bernie Martinez

12:05.349 --> 12:10.855
as they make this formal
and beautiful commitment to one another.

12:10.938 --> 12:12.273
Beautiful day for a wedding, huh?

12:12.356 --> 12:14.442
["Air on the G String" by Bach playing]

12:15.401 --> 12:17.528
Cut the bullshit. You went into my brain.

12:17.611 --> 12:20.823
You took my brother from my memories.
My dead brother.

12:22.199 --> 12:24.326
Are you enjoying this? This a game to you?

12:24.410 --> 12:25.786
Cas, we want you to be happy.

12:25.870 --> 12:29.623
Then take me to the real Niko
and then to the Salvare

12:30.249 --> 12:32.376
and get your fucking Artifact
off my planet.

12:32.460 --> 12:34.086
We need a voice on Earth.

12:34.170 --> 12:36.297
-What voice?
-Yours.

12:36.881 --> 12:38.799
[Zayn] At first, I resisted love.

12:38.883 --> 12:41.302
Even when you told me you loved me,
I thought,

12:41.385 --> 12:43.137
"We're not home. This isn't safe."

12:44.138 --> 12:46.432
There was so much tragedy around us,
so much grief.

12:47.099 --> 12:48.434
You killed my friends.

12:49.310 --> 12:52.521
You blew up a planet.
I'm not gonna be your fuckin' spokeslady.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.857
-We can make you do it.
-So then, why ask?

12:54.940 --> 12:57.485
It's better
if you accept the implant willingly.

12:57.568 --> 13:01.906
-Sasha struggled. Look where that got him.
-I'm not gonna help you destroy Earth.

13:01.989 --> 13:04.241
No. We are restoring Earth.

13:05.117 --> 13:06.827
We're here to help heal your planet.

13:06.911 --> 13:08.454
Yeah, I've seen what that looks like.

13:08.537 --> 13:11.874
-What's that?
-Millions dead. The rest in hiding.

13:11.957 --> 13:14.001
Because Zakir didn't have someone like you

13:14.585 --> 13:16.879
to assure them
that we didn't mean any harm.

13:16.962 --> 13:19.006
Imagine what life on Earth
could've been like

13:19.089 --> 13:21.175
without any of humanity's problems.

13:22.468 --> 13:24.553
Join us in making this,

13:25.179 --> 13:26.639
this version of Earth,

13:27.223 --> 13:30.684
all of this, a reality.

13:32.978 --> 13:34.480
How could you say no to that?

13:37.191 --> 13:38.400
Whatever you're doing to Cas--

13:38.484 --> 13:40.820
You mean helping her achieve
her full potential?

13:40.903 --> 13:42.321
You're lying to her.

13:42.947 --> 13:45.241
All to get one of those fucking things
inside of her head.

13:45.324 --> 13:47.535
You're scared, and not just for Cas.

13:47.618 --> 13:49.703
I wanna trust you. I do.

13:51.163 --> 13:53.624
And I wanna come
to some form of an agreement.

13:54.333 --> 13:57.920
One that doesn't involve
turning me or Cas into a puppet.

13:58.003 --> 14:00.840
So let's start over.
Let's find our way to peace.

14:03.133 --> 14:06.011
I'm sorry, Niko. You had your chance.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.267
And you had yours.

14:14.562 --> 14:15.855
[grunts]

14:19.942 --> 14:20.943
[engine roars]

14:22.152 --> 14:25.906
Niko, even if your shuttle
could penetrate the hull,

14:25.990 --> 14:27.741
you'd immediately disintegrate.

14:27.825 --> 14:29.243
[grunts and gasps]

14:30.160 --> 14:31.787
You wanna see disintegrate?

14:38.127 --> 14:39.545
-[alarm blares]
-[Salvare] Warning.

14:39.628 --> 14:42.590
Fusion engine malfunction.
Plasma explosion imminent.

14:42.673 --> 14:43.924
-Override.
-Override.

14:44.008 --> 14:45.426
Blowing up your shuttle?

14:46.135 --> 14:47.303
It's resourceful.

14:47.803 --> 14:50.514
Whatever it takes
to let the Salvare get back to Earth.

14:51.098 --> 14:53.642
Critical temperature reached.
Evacuate shuttle.

14:54.393 --> 14:55.269
[grunting]

14:55.811 --> 14:56.937
[gasping]

14:57.021 --> 14:58.814
[ship rumbling and clattering]

15:00.149 --> 15:02.151
[power shutting down]

15:02.651 --> 15:04.445
[clanking]

15:04.528 --> 15:05.779
[loud thump]

15:06.363 --> 15:07.489
[grinding]

15:08.407 --> 15:09.491
[Niko gasps]

15:11.285 --> 15:12.244
[thump]

15:14.747 --> 15:16.457
[loud thumping]

15:17.416 --> 15:18.792
[whimpering]

15:21.587 --> 15:22.755
You say you want peace.

15:24.214 --> 15:25.090
This isn't peace.

15:25.174 --> 15:27.468
Peace with your species is impossible.

15:27.551 --> 15:28.802
[screams]

15:28.886 --> 15:30.095
-[yells]
-[panting]

15:33.390 --> 15:35.142
We extended an olive branch,

15:36.101 --> 15:39.772
and you gave us fear and aggression
in return.

15:40.356 --> 15:42.524
Same as when you sent in your armies
on Earth.

15:43.567 --> 15:44.944
What happened on Earth?

15:45.027 --> 15:48.155
You won't submit, but Cas will.

15:49.990 --> 15:51.241
[loud, buzzing hum]

15:51.325 --> 15:53.327
[screams]

15:55.204 --> 15:57.206
[intense rumbling]

15:59.917 --> 16:01.585
[crashing]

16:03.921 --> 16:05.506
What's-- what's happening?

16:06.548 --> 16:08.258
[intense whooshing]

16:09.426 --> 16:10.678
-[clattering]
-[screams]

16:11.637 --> 16:13.180
-Javier?
-Oh, God.

16:13.263 --> 16:14.098
[Iara gasps]

16:15.849 --> 16:16.850
Talk to me, William.

16:16.934 --> 16:18.727
The ship just dropped out of FTL.

16:19.228 --> 16:20.354
Cas repaired the damage.

16:20.437 --> 16:23.315
It's not the FTL ring. There doesn't
seem to be a mechanical problem.

16:23.399 --> 16:25.651
It's not the Salvare. Look.

16:27.403 --> 16:29.154
What is that? A pulsar?

16:29.238 --> 16:32.658
Not just any pulsar.
It's a motherfuckin' magnetar.

16:32.741 --> 16:34.618
We need to jump back
before the next wave hits.

16:34.702 --> 16:37.413
Our engines are destabilized
from the sudden drop from FTL.

16:37.496 --> 16:39.498
-We jump now--
-[Dillon] And we're all burnt toast.

16:39.581 --> 16:41.959
Javier's in the particle accelerator.
He needs help.

16:42.042 --> 16:43.544
He's having a seizure. Please.

16:43.627 --> 16:45.754
The magnetar must be affecting
his implant.

16:45.838 --> 16:49.091
Zayn, Javier needs you.
Particle accelerator, now.

16:49.174 --> 16:50.050
[Zayn] On my way.

16:50.551 --> 16:52.177
Can we stabilize the FTL array?

16:52.261 --> 16:54.138
There's no time.
The next blast is imminent.

16:54.221 --> 16:56.807
-[Javier groans]
-Okay. Describe what you're feeling.

16:56.890 --> 16:58.684
Like my brain's a bonfire.

16:58.767 --> 17:00.811
[screams] Jesus, the lights! The lights!

17:00.894 --> 17:02.438
Dim lights 50%.

17:02.521 --> 17:05.357
Bend forward, hold steady.
I have a nerve-blocker. Okay.

17:05.941 --> 17:06.984
[explosion]

17:07.067 --> 17:08.694
-[Zayn] Ah! Damn.
-[Bernie] What was that?

17:08.777 --> 17:09.987
[William] Attention.

17:10.070 --> 17:13.741
-Energy burst impact in three, two, one.
-[Javier yelling]

17:13.824 --> 17:15.451
[loud crashing]

17:15.534 --> 17:17.202
-[energy whooshing]
-He'll break his teeth.

17:17.286 --> 17:18.620
Help me get his mouth open.

17:19.204 --> 17:20.205
Javier?

17:21.498 --> 17:22.666
[energy subsides]

17:22.750 --> 17:24.460
-[holo appears]
-[Zayn sighs]

17:25.961 --> 17:29.757
Is this gonna happen every time
there's a blast from that star?

17:33.177 --> 17:35.179
[hyperventilating]

17:40.309 --> 17:42.311
[breathing slows]

17:43.771 --> 17:45.564
[gasping]

17:45.647 --> 17:46.482
[ping]

17:46.565 --> 17:50.527
An Achaian ring just appeared
on our scanners. 400,000 kilometers away.

17:51.028 --> 17:52.571
How long till it catches up?

17:54.156 --> 17:54.990
William?

17:57.034 --> 17:58.619
Based on my readings, it--

17:59.453 --> 18:00.621
it's dead in the water.

18:02.623 --> 18:07.336
Extensive damage to the exterior hull,
extreme power fluctuations to the ring.

18:07.419 --> 18:09.755
Holy shit. How did this happen?

18:09.838 --> 18:10.839
The magnetar.

18:10.923 --> 18:13.717
It must affect Achaian tech
differently than ours.

18:15.052 --> 18:16.386
What about life signs?

18:16.470 --> 18:17.846
Niko? Cas?

18:17.930 --> 18:19.598
I'm not pickin' anythin' up.

18:23.143 --> 18:24.061
Take us there.

18:24.645 --> 18:30.150
Do you, Zayn Petrossian,
take this man to be your husband?

18:30.651 --> 18:31.485
Yes.

18:32.778 --> 18:34.822
And do you, Bernard Emiliano Martinez--

18:34.905 --> 18:37.199
-Yes! Yes, yes!
-[laughing]

18:39.743 --> 18:40.577
Your turn.

18:43.789 --> 18:44.790
I don't know.

18:45.415 --> 18:47.292
[low rumbling]

18:52.798 --> 18:53.799
Decide!

18:54.842 --> 18:57.386
No. They're not dead. They're not real.

18:58.679 --> 18:59.930
They're not real.

19:00.013 --> 19:03.058
But what is real
is that not everybody's goin' home alive.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.978
So who'll it be?
Who else are you prepared to lose?

19:06.061 --> 19:08.647
Bernie? Richard? Javier?

19:09.148 --> 19:10.107
Niko?

19:10.774 --> 19:13.443
And that's if there's even an Earth
when you get home.

19:16.905 --> 19:19.908
-What is that supposed to mean?
-We can have Niko home by dinner.

19:21.451 --> 19:25.289
And me, Cas.
The Achaia can give you your brother back,

19:25.372 --> 19:27.166
bring him back from the dead.

19:28.625 --> 19:32.254
You'll never have to feel alone
ever again.

19:32.337 --> 19:33.881
[low rumbling continues]

19:33.964 --> 19:35.799
All you have to do is say yes, Cas.

19:45.809 --> 19:47.603
[Cas screaming]

19:49.396 --> 19:50.355
[panting]

19:50.439 --> 19:52.816
It's me. Cas. Cas! It's Niko.

19:52.900 --> 19:55.360
It was them, trying to get
one of those things in your head.

19:55.444 --> 19:56.320
Okay?

19:56.403 --> 19:58.197
You good? You're good.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.407
Get up. [grunts]

20:00.490 --> 20:02.075
We gotta move. Come on.

20:03.577 --> 20:04.912
[chiming]

20:05.996 --> 20:07.664
Hey. What do you got for me?

20:07.748 --> 20:11.126
Are you absolutely sure Jana didn't bring
the ring into the Artifact?

20:11.210 --> 20:12.961
No. Niko brought this ring
with her to space.

20:13.045 --> 20:16.173
Well, maybe she left it behind
and Jana found it.

20:16.256 --> 20:19.801
Or maybe she gave it to Jana
before she left for the Salvare.

20:19.885 --> 20:21.178
Is it Niko's ring or not?

20:22.095 --> 20:26.183
I found traces of Niko's DNA on it,
but that doesn't mean anything.

20:26.266 --> 20:27.768
Not if Jana made this up.

20:27.851 --> 20:30.896
I carried her into the Artifact.
This ring was not on her.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.815
Then I guess it has to be Niko's.

20:35.484 --> 20:37.194
And if that's the case,

20:37.277 --> 20:42.449
the Artifact might be some sort of portal
between Earth and interstellar space.

20:42.532 --> 20:44.117
And Niko's alive.

20:46.954 --> 20:47.996
Thank you, Nani.

20:50.165 --> 20:51.166
[chiming]

20:52.626 --> 20:53.752
[sighs]

20:55.462 --> 20:57.464
[cicadas chirping]

21:03.929 --> 21:04.763
Ava?

21:14.648 --> 21:16.984
[Erik] Is-- I-- Just tell me--

21:17.067 --> 21:18.986
Look, really, what the fuck is going on?

21:19.069 --> 21:20.696
Who are you guys? Like, I--

21:21.321 --> 21:22.155
Can I talk?

21:23.907 --> 21:24.741
Hello?

21:25.242 --> 21:26.201
[man] Be careful.

21:26.994 --> 21:29.329
You don't want
one of those things attacking you.

21:29.413 --> 21:31.248
[Erik] What--wh-- what things?

21:31.331 --> 21:34.001
The-- the things. Oh, shit!
You've seen the things.

21:34.084 --> 21:35.836
The--the-- the tentacles.

21:35.919 --> 21:38.964
Oh, my God.
Do you have Harper Glass? Can I see her?

21:41.675 --> 21:42.718
Oh fuck.

21:43.302 --> 21:44.386
You work for the Achaia.

21:44.469 --> 21:48.015
No, no. I work for USIC.
I'm trying to communicate with the Achaia.

21:48.098 --> 21:51.810
You're a child, looking up at a killer
thinking he's a god.

21:51.893 --> 21:53.770
No. I--
No, I have a daughter who needs me.

21:53.854 --> 21:55.647
Then for her sake, you need to listen.

21:56.231 --> 21:57.190
I'm listening.

21:57.816 --> 21:59.651
The Achaia are not our friends.

22:00.902 --> 22:04.948
They do not belong here.
Do not aid them. Do not engage.

22:07.617 --> 22:08.535
Look, man,

22:10.287 --> 22:11.455
who are you guys?

22:12.914 --> 22:14.124
What do you know?

22:14.708 --> 22:16.376
Humankind has a choice.

22:17.294 --> 22:18.837
Accept and die,

22:19.838 --> 22:21.757
or resist and endure.

22:24.134 --> 22:25.635
I don't get any questions?

22:26.136 --> 22:28.138
[intense whooshing]

22:33.810 --> 22:36.813
The Achaia aren't invincible.
The magnetar proves it.

22:36.897 --> 22:40.108
If we can weaponize it, we'd have the
biggest motherfucking gun in the galaxy.

22:40.192 --> 22:43.070
-We don't know how it caused this damage.
-So we analyze it.

22:43.153 --> 22:45.113
Be ready when
the next energy burst passes.

22:45.197 --> 22:47.282
We have a piece of the Artifact
on this ship.

22:47.366 --> 22:51.036
We could do a real-time analysis of the
molecular structure next time a wave hits.

22:51.119 --> 22:52.662
Great idea. Get to it.

22:53.246 --> 22:55.999
-How long till that star erupts again?
-Could be any moment.

22:56.083 --> 22:57.042
[sighs] Okay.

22:59.086 --> 22:59.920
Shit!

23:00.879 --> 23:03.340
So much for the big damn gun.

23:03.423 --> 23:05.592
That's it? That's all we had?

23:06.218 --> 23:07.302
Afraid so.

23:12.057 --> 23:15.185
Javier is a member of our crew.
He's not a science experiment.

23:15.685 --> 23:17.104
The implant is Achaian tech.

23:17.187 --> 23:19.523
How do we know
it's not turned to dust too?

23:19.606 --> 23:20.607
Is it?

23:21.274 --> 23:22.234
Is it dust?

23:22.734 --> 23:26.238
Based on my latest scans,
it's showing slight degradation. But no.

23:27.114 --> 23:30.659
The immune system seems to be shielding
the implant, possibly repairing it.

23:32.536 --> 23:36.331
-I don't blame you for pushing back.
-Removing Javier's implant is unethical.

23:36.415 --> 23:39.000
Criminal. He's in a coma. He's not dead.

23:39.084 --> 23:41.628
We cannot continue to play defense
against a species

23:41.711 --> 23:43.171
that destroys planets on a whim.

23:43.255 --> 23:45.924
Look, Javier would volunteer if he could.

23:46.007 --> 23:48.218
-And I'd try and stop him.
-And you'd be wrong.

23:49.553 --> 23:52.431
Look, we don't know
what the Achaia are doing back on Earth.

23:52.514 --> 23:56.184
But if they're as nasty as they are
out here, this could save everybody.

23:56.268 --> 23:57.769
[Richard] This is not a discussion.

23:58.395 --> 24:01.982
Either you do the surgery
or I wake up a doctor who will.

24:10.323 --> 24:12.367
[sighs] If anybody can save him, it's--

24:12.451 --> 24:15.579
I'm about to do keyhole brain surgery.
Now's not the time, Bernie.

24:21.418 --> 24:23.920
-[sizzling]
-Oh--

24:24.337 --> 24:27.424
-Calm-- Okay. Easy.
-[Zayn] Javier, easy! Easy/

24:30.385 --> 24:32.637
-Hey! Hey! Hey! Come on.
-[alarm blaring]

24:32.721 --> 24:34.639
Come on. Come on.

24:34.723 --> 24:37.017
Come on. That's right. Come on, come on.

24:37.517 --> 24:38.935
Let's go. Let's go.

24:39.019 --> 24:40.562
-Hey!
-Let's go!

24:40.645 --> 24:41.646
[grunts]

24:44.691 --> 24:46.443
-Hold him down.
-[Zayn] Let me get a sedative.

24:46.526 --> 24:47.652
-[Richard] No time!
-Wait!

24:47.736 --> 24:49.196
It's complicated brain surgery!

24:49.279 --> 24:51.865
And if that implant turns to dust
before we get it out,

24:51.948 --> 24:54.034
-then it's no good to anyone.
-[squelching]

24:54.117 --> 24:55.243
You're killing him!

24:55.327 --> 24:56.703
[sighs]

24:57.245 --> 24:58.538
-Got it.
-[whirring]

24:58.622 --> 24:59.956
[screeching]

25:00.040 --> 25:01.625
[steady bleep]

25:01.708 --> 25:03.919
-[Javier falls]
-[alarm continues blaring]

25:04.753 --> 25:06.755
His sacrifice will not be in vain.

25:06.838 --> 25:08.840
[implant screeching]

25:11.301 --> 25:12.677
[Zayn sobbing]

25:13.178 --> 25:14.012
[alarm stops]

25:14.763 --> 25:17.349
[Cas] But they were all dead.
They said Earth was next.

25:17.432 --> 25:19.351
[Niko] None of it was real, Cas.

25:19.434 --> 25:23.271
You know, whatever they offered you,
you resisted it. I was about to give in.

25:24.397 --> 25:26.274
Look at me. All right?

25:27.442 --> 25:29.945
It's over. And I need you.

25:31.196 --> 25:32.364
-You hear me?
-Yeah.

25:32.447 --> 25:34.115
-Yeah.
-I still need you.

25:34.199 --> 25:36.076
Okay. I got you.

25:36.159 --> 25:37.536
-You're okay.
-I'm here.

25:38.286 --> 25:39.162
Let's go.

25:42.123 --> 25:45.585
[Cas] The ring's so degraded.
I bet we could just fly out of here.

25:45.669 --> 25:49.130
[Niko] Not in our shuttle.
The engine's been ripped right out  of it.

25:49.756 --> 25:51.424
Niko! Niko, look!

25:51.508 --> 25:53.218
[laughs] They came back!

25:54.052 --> 25:57.180
But they have no idea we're even here,
and we can't use our comms.

25:57.264 --> 25:58.598
No. Actually, we can.

25:58.682 --> 25:59.516
Okay.

25:59.599 --> 26:01.601
[screeching]

26:02.602 --> 26:04.896
[William] The magnetar has unleashed
another energy burst.

26:04.980 --> 26:06.356
Bernie, talk to me.

26:06.439 --> 26:10.277
-We're set.
-We better be. Impact in three, two, one.

26:10.360 --> 26:11.403
[loud explosion]

26:12.070 --> 26:12.946
[groans]

26:14.114 --> 26:16.074
That was a hell of a lot stronger.

26:16.157 --> 26:17.951
Yep. It's begun degradin' our mainframe.

26:18.034 --> 26:20.203
We can't withstand
another impact that size.

26:20.870 --> 26:21.746
[Richard] Did it work?

26:24.040 --> 26:24.874
What you got?

26:26.710 --> 26:27.961
It's neutrinos.

26:29.379 --> 26:31.006
That's it? Neutrinos?

26:31.089 --> 26:34.009
I don't-- I don't understand.
Neutrinos are everywhere.

26:34.092 --> 26:36.177
They pass through us all the time.
They're harmless.

26:36.261 --> 26:38.680
Harmless to us, but not Achaian tech,
apparently.

26:39.472 --> 26:42.350
Molecules knocked out of atoms,
protons ripped apart.

26:42.976 --> 26:45.395
Think of the burst like--
like streams of water.

26:45.895 --> 26:49.274
With enough concentrated force,
water can cut through steel.

26:51.067 --> 26:53.111
-We can make a weapon.
-Yeah.

26:53.903 --> 26:57.657
-Prepare to jump.
-Jump? Whoa. Niko and Cas are right there.

26:58.491 --> 27:00.702
Are you picking up any signs of life?

27:00.785 --> 27:01.870
Still nothing. No.

27:04.914 --> 27:08.084
I'm sorry.
Meet me on the Observation Deck.

27:08.710 --> 27:09.711
We're goin' home.

27:14.466 --> 27:17.886
[Cas] The Achaia are smart,
but they didn't think of everything.

27:18.595 --> 27:21.723
I can hot-wire our signal
using the helmet comms.

27:21.806 --> 27:22.766
[Niko] Nice.

27:24.893 --> 27:27.771
Niko would do
exactly the same thing in my shoes.

27:31.775 --> 27:32.734
On your count.

27:34.110 --> 27:36.529
Salvare, this is Dosojin. Do you copy?

27:40.408 --> 27:42.619
Initializing the bubble in five,

27:43.745 --> 27:44.579
four…

27:47.082 --> 27:48.583
William, I gave you an order.

27:48.667 --> 27:52.170
I'm pickin' up a faint radio communication
from the Acahian ring.

27:52.671 --> 27:54.297
-Pulling it up now.
-[whirring]

27:54.381 --> 27:56.591
[Cas, breaking up]
Salvare, this is Dosojin. Do you copy?

27:57.342 --> 27:59.386
-[William] We hear you, Dosojin.
-[both sigh]

28:00.595 --> 28:02.263
We need to get you off that ship.

28:02.347 --> 28:03.932
Two steps ahead of you, buddy.

28:07.727 --> 28:09.521
You up for another space walk?

28:13.775 --> 28:14.693
[Niko] It's too late.

28:14.776 --> 28:17.362
-Don't try and stop us.
-I'm not here to threaten you.

28:17.862 --> 28:19.572
We need you to save us.

28:20.865 --> 28:21.950
You want mercy?

28:22.909 --> 28:23.743
From us?

28:31.376 --> 28:33.044
You say you want peace?

28:34.921 --> 28:35.964
Prove it.

28:37.090 --> 28:37.924
Niko.

28:40.844 --> 28:42.262
You want our protection?

28:43.680 --> 28:44.764
You have to swear.

28:46.307 --> 28:47.851
Swear that you won't harm Earth.

28:49.144 --> 28:51.020
You have my word.

29:01.823 --> 29:04.534
Achaian tech is susceptible
to high-density neutrino bursts

29:04.617 --> 29:05.952
that magnetar's shooting out.

29:06.035 --> 29:08.204
-How do we stop that?
-Stop that?

29:08.288 --> 29:11.166
-How do we save them?
-No, no. We're not saving them.

29:11.249 --> 29:13.585
We need to get the science to USIC
to destroy them.

29:13.668 --> 29:17.172
And Niko's deal will make sure
there's a USIC for us to get back to.

29:17.255 --> 29:18.923
Their lives for Earth's safety.

29:19.424 --> 29:22.302
-You trust them?
-No. But they don't trust us either.

29:22.385 --> 29:24.137
There are thousands
of Achaian lives there.

29:24.220 --> 29:26.347
We save them, we'll earn their trust.

29:26.431 --> 29:28.725
-Will we have time to save them?
-[Richard] Good question.

29:30.059 --> 29:30.935
I'm not sure.

29:33.062 --> 29:35.398
Each eruption has been stronger
than the last one.

29:35.482 --> 29:38.860
-We need to leave before the next one.
-Agreed. But not without the Achaia.

29:41.112 --> 29:43.406
-Commander.
-Dillon Conner.

29:44.324 --> 29:45.158
Where's--

29:46.576 --> 29:49.037
Never mind. Catch me up later.
Right now I need to figure out

29:49.120 --> 29:51.164
how to shield the Achaian ring
from the energy bursts.

29:51.247 --> 29:52.999
-What stops neutrinos?
-Water.

29:53.082 --> 29:55.585
We'd need a solar system's worth
to form a cloud thick enough.

29:55.668 --> 29:58.338
-If we bring them on board?
-They don't breathe our atmosphere.

29:58.421 --> 30:01.132
-We don't even know if they breathe.
-Let's tow it out of range.

30:01.841 --> 30:06.554
By rerouting the Salvare's artificial
gravity to focus outside the ship, boom.

30:06.638 --> 30:07.889
Makeshift tractor beam.

30:07.972 --> 30:08.848
Do it.

30:09.933 --> 30:12.936
Everywhere but the Crow's Nest.
Welcome to the team, Dillon.

30:16.564 --> 30:18.566
[bleeping]

30:23.988 --> 30:24.906
He's breathing.

30:26.074 --> 30:28.576
Yeah.
His respiratory system's functioning.

30:28.660 --> 30:31.621
That's good, right?
You know, there's, uh… hope.

30:32.539 --> 30:33.414
Hope?

30:33.957 --> 30:37.961
Sure. About as much hope as you
making a weapon out of your neutrinos.

30:38.044 --> 30:39.921
I mean, like, we can treat him.

30:40.463 --> 30:42.715
-You know, stem cell therapy. There's--
-Bernie!

30:42.799 --> 30:44.509
Do you know what happened

30:44.592 --> 30:46.636
when that tech was ripped
out of his brain,

30:46.719 --> 30:49.055
aside from the massive
intracranial hemorrhage?

30:49.597 --> 30:50.807
His brain turned to pulp.

30:51.724 --> 30:53.893
Okay, look, I'm sorry. All right?

30:53.977 --> 30:57.355
I love the guy, too, but we made
the best decision that we could,

30:57.438 --> 30:58.606
and it was the right one.

30:59.649 --> 31:02.944
[Niko] Everybody, strap in.
Artificial grav's about to get rerouted.

31:04.237 --> 31:06.990
You and Richard are dealing
in hypotheticals, but here's a reality.

31:07.073 --> 31:08.658
You sacrificed Javier's future,

31:08.741 --> 31:11.035
and we have no idea
if it was even worth it.

31:15.957 --> 31:17.292
[sighs]

31:18.042 --> 31:19.460
[intense whooshing]

31:20.962 --> 31:24.299
Hot spot on the magnetar's surface.
Another blast is imminent.

31:24.382 --> 31:25.675
On your go, Dillon.

31:25.758 --> 31:30.722
All right. Rerouting all the exotic matter
to the ass-end of the Salvare.

31:31.681 --> 31:33.558
Tow should be engaged…

31:33.641 --> 31:35.351
-[bleeping]
-…now.

31:38.605 --> 31:41.024
The hot spot appears critically unstable.

31:41.691 --> 31:43.860
Estimated 30 seconds until another blast.

31:44.444 --> 31:45.904
Engaging impulse engines.

31:52.035 --> 31:53.411
[William] The tether's holding.

31:53.995 --> 31:57.248
-Twenty seconds to impact.
-We good to increase speed, Dillon?

31:57.332 --> 32:00.293
-[Dillon] Yeah. Go for it.
-[William] It's working.

32:01.628 --> 32:03.630
On track to clear the blast radius

32:03.713 --> 32:08.092
in eight, seven, six, five…

32:08.176 --> 32:10.219
[crashing]

32:13.806 --> 32:14.891
What the hell just happened?

32:14.974 --> 32:18.269
All of our artificial gravity
has been rerouted to the Salvare.

32:18.353 --> 32:21.230
We lost the tow? Reconnect now.

32:21.314 --> 32:24.567
No. There's no time. This next blast
will knock our systems out.

32:34.410 --> 32:35.244
Go.

33:02.230 --> 33:03.064
What happened?

33:03.147 --> 33:04.983
[Dillon] There was an override on the tow.

33:05.066 --> 33:07.068
-Who had access to the tow?
-Where were you?

33:07.151 --> 33:09.696
Not undermining an ongoing operation,
if that's what you're asking.

33:09.779 --> 33:11.906
Well, someone did. And I wanna know who.

33:12.490 --> 33:13.992
Runnin' a diagnostic now.

33:15.410 --> 33:17.120
The Achaians punch back.

33:18.162 --> 33:21.457
If that ship got out a message
that I let them die, Earth is gonna pay.

33:21.541 --> 33:23.251
[William] But, Niko, you didn't.

33:23.334 --> 33:27.380
The interruption to power wasn't initiated
by a member of this crew.

33:27.463 --> 33:30.466
And… I know I didn't do it,

33:30.550 --> 33:34.637
so that leaves only one other possibility.

33:36.431 --> 33:37.348
Iara.
