WEBVTT

00:09.009 --> 00:11.345
When you two first came into my office,

00:11.428 --> 00:15.224
I was like,
"This marriage is not going to last."

00:15.307 --> 00:20.938
But you've really put the work in.
I deem your marriage fixed.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.231
Thanks, Dr. Janet.

00:22.314 --> 00:25.817
We couldn't have done this without you
and your many novelty certificates.

00:25.901 --> 00:30.030
Well, this has certainly been a big year
for the Rabitowitz marriage.

00:30.113 --> 00:31.281
It certainly has.

00:31.365 --> 00:34.660
But now it's New Year's Eve and, Katie,
my New Year's resolution to you

00:34.743 --> 00:37.621
is to spend more time
with my wonderful wife, who I--

00:37.704 --> 00:39.790
I gotta take this.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.458
-Oh, um, but--
-Hello.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.085
Hey, partner, big news. Huge news.

00:43.168 --> 00:44.253
I'm all ears.

00:44.336 --> 00:46.505
<i>The Flight of the Pegasus</i>
just lost their lead.

00:46.588 --> 00:47.923
They start shooting next week.

00:48.006 --> 00:52.844
So what you're telling me is David Pincher
needs a new star immediately

00:52.928 --> 00:56.598
for his three-picture young adult
dystopian future franchise?

00:56.682 --> 00:58.100
Yup. What's that I hear?

00:58.183 --> 01:00.060
Beep beep.
Someone's calling on the other line.

01:00.143 --> 01:01.395
That's strange. Hello?

01:01.478 --> 01:04.481
It's Oodles of Money calling.
Will we accept the charges?

01:04.565 --> 01:06.483
Why would Oodles of Money
be calling collect?

01:06.567 --> 01:09.069
I don't know. Don't accept the charges,
we cannot afford it.

01:09.152 --> 01:11.405
I gotta go in. I'm sorry.

01:11.488 --> 01:14.741
Okay. But make sure
you're back before, you know.

01:14.825 --> 01:17.619
Deal. Best deal I ever made.

01:17.703 --> 01:20.998
Boom!
What's black and white and sexy all over?

01:21.081 --> 01:22.165
Chuff Hollister.

01:22.249 --> 01:25.002
He's young, he's hot,
he's Australian or British or whatever.

01:25.085 --> 01:27.671
We can paint over his stripes
so he looks like a horse.

01:27.754 --> 01:30.966
I can see the headline now:
Chuff Hollister is...

01:31.049 --> 01:32.467
The next Pegasus.

01:32.551 --> 01:35.887
BoJack's got star power and grit
up the wazoo. I can't imagine...

01:35.971 --> 01:39.433
Anyone who would appeal
to the audience more than Chuff.

01:39.516 --> 01:40.642
He's got sex appeal...

01:40.726 --> 01:42.144
- Gravitas...
- Youth...

01:42.227 --> 01:45.272
- Experience...
- And abs coming out of the wazoo.

01:45.355 --> 01:47.024
And what a wazoo it is.

01:47.107 --> 01:49.693
- This would put Gekko-Rabitowitz--
- On the map.

01:49.776 --> 01:52.446
The map of profitable agencies, that is.

01:52.529 --> 01:54.573
Perfect, because without it
we could be in--

01:54.656 --> 01:57.659
Real trouble. We did not hit
our projected earnings for the year.

01:57.743 --> 02:00.912
The year's not over yet.
We still have one day to go all out.

02:00.996 --> 02:03.540
Rutabaga, do you think
we have the spunk and moxie--

02:03.624 --> 02:05.709
That's a good name
for a lady detective series.

02:05.792 --> 02:08.253
--required to pull this off
and save the agency?

02:08.337 --> 02:09.630
Hell yeah, I do.

02:09.713 --> 02:12.758
That would be a great title
for a movie about marrying Satan.

02:12.841 --> 02:14.801
How are we losing money?

02:14.885 --> 02:17.596
Vanessa, we're getting Chuff this part
and coming out on top.

02:17.679 --> 02:21.266
I know we will,
because we're the good guys.

02:23.310 --> 02:30.150
<i>♪♪</i>

03:18.407 --> 03:21.159
Suck a duck a duck a dick, dumbshit.

03:21.243 --> 03:22.911
- Hey, Sarah Lynn.
<i>- Hey, loser.</i>

03:22.994 --> 03:25.414
Did you get a call
about that <i>Ethan Around</i> thing?

03:25.497 --> 03:27.999
- You're not gonna do it, are you?
- I'm sorry, what thing?

03:28.083 --> 03:32.045
<i>Ethan Around,</i> the <i>Horsin' Around</i>
sequel series Brad's trying to get made?

03:32.129 --> 03:35.757
He called to ask me, I asked him,
can you put a bullet in my brain?

03:35.841 --> 03:38.009
That would probably be
a better career move.

03:38.093 --> 03:40.512
Wait, slow down.
Did you say <i>Ethan Around?</i>

03:40.595 --> 03:43.056
I know.
It should be <i>Sabrina Around,</i> right?

03:43.140 --> 03:44.850
That's a show people would watch.

03:44.933 --> 03:48.103
Sabrina doing cool skateboard tricks
and eating kettle corn.

03:48.186 --> 03:51.815
Hold on, if this was a real thing,
why would Brad call you and not me?

03:51.898 --> 03:53.650
Who knows?
Why do people do anything?

03:53.734 --> 03:57.571
Why did I make the cartoon tree grandma
from <i>Pocahontas</i> my emergency contact?

03:57.654 --> 04:00.407
Are you sure this whole thing
isn't just a semi-lucid fever dream

04:00.490 --> 04:01.908
from mixing the wrong pills?

04:01.992 --> 04:04.870
Did you not hear?
I'm clean and sober, eight months.

04:04.953 --> 04:05.996
Really? That's incredible.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.498
Yeah, I wanted a change in my life.

04:08.582 --> 04:11.126
Because I heard
if you stop doing drugs for a while,

04:11.209 --> 04:14.045
the first time you do them again,
it's amazing.

04:14.129 --> 04:16.631
-What? No, just stay sober.
-Ugh!

04:16.715 --> 04:19.426
Whatever.
Call me when you're ready to party.

04:24.389 --> 04:25.682
Well, that's troubling.

04:25.766 --> 04:28.310
Can you believe they're doing
a <i>Horsin' Around</i> reboot without me?

04:28.393 --> 04:31.480
What do you care?
You're about to be nominated for an Oscar.

04:31.563 --> 04:33.273
Not the point. This is about respect.

04:33.356 --> 04:35.400
BoJack, is this really a good idea?

04:36.735 --> 04:38.069
Tools. Brad speaking.

04:38.153 --> 04:40.530
You're doing a new show
in the extended <i>Horsin' Around</i>

04:40.614 --> 04:42.365
cinematic universe and you didn't call me?

04:42.449 --> 04:46.077
Hey, BoJack.
<i>Ethan Around</i> is just an idea I had.

04:46.161 --> 04:47.913
<i>It's not officially happening or anything.</i>

04:47.996 --> 04:52.167
I would love for you to be part of it,
but the horse died in the series finale.

04:52.250 --> 04:55.462
So? We could write around that.
The Horse dying was just a dream.

04:55.545 --> 04:58.340
The Horse had a twin brother,
comes back as a ghost.

04:58.423 --> 05:01.218
Ethan missed the Horse so much
he built a robot Horse as a tribute.

05:01.301 --> 05:05.347
"I've heard of overloaded motherboards,
but this is ridiculous."

05:05.430 --> 05:08.016
Those are off the top of my head,
they're all gold.

05:08.099 --> 05:09.768
I'm surprised you're so into the idea.

05:09.851 --> 05:12.479
I've been having trouble
getting networks on the phone,

05:12.562 --> 05:15.899
but with a big star like you attached,
we could sell this right away.

05:15.982 --> 05:17.400
I wouldn't say I'm attached...

05:17.484 --> 05:20.445
Don't move.
I'm getting the next flight down to LA.

05:20.529 --> 05:22.322
- Right now?
- And purchased.

05:22.405 --> 05:24.157
BoJack, for the last 20 years

05:24.241 --> 05:26.910
I've been telling people
I didn't need the trappings of fame,

05:26.993 --> 05:30.205
that I was better off,
happy with my little B-plus life

05:30.288 --> 05:34.292
at my little B-plus hardware store
in little B-plus Olympia, Washington.

05:34.376 --> 05:36.294
B-minus children. But it's a lie.

05:36.378 --> 05:38.922
I miss the warmth of the spotlight
on my face.

05:39.005 --> 05:41.716
The thrill of telling a joke
and feeling it land.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.802
Is that a thrill you experienced?

05:43.885 --> 05:48.306
The sitcom stage is my home,
and I'm tired of denying myself that.

05:48.390 --> 05:50.141
I'm ready to come home.

05:50.225 --> 05:52.477
Great.

05:52.561 --> 05:54.813
-Why did you let me call him?
-Ugh.

05:58.024 --> 06:01.903
Ah, smell that Labrador Peninsula air.
Keep an eye out for my brother.

06:01.987 --> 06:05.365
- How will I know which one's him?
- He's the one that looks like me.

06:05.448 --> 06:07.867
- Got it.
<i>- Who's that dog? Mister P--</i>

06:07.951 --> 06:09.911
- Hello?
- Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.

06:09.995 --> 06:11.788
Is this an okay time to talk business?

06:11.871 --> 06:13.999
Yeah, I'm just waiting
for Captain Peanutbutter.

06:14.082 --> 06:15.834
What is that, like, a cereal?

06:15.917 --> 06:17.043
No, my brother.

06:17.127 --> 06:19.713
- He's picking us up at the airport.
- Nice.

06:19.796 --> 06:22.132
Speaking of driving people places,

06:22.215 --> 06:25.010
Cabracadabra
had a killer holiday season

06:25.093 --> 06:27.887
and I think New Year's
is going to be even bigger.

06:27.971 --> 06:31.891
I'm loving that segue, Todd.
You are a conversational Magellan.

06:31.975 --> 06:35.770
Turns out there's a huge demand
for a safe space for women. Who knew?

06:35.854 --> 06:37.522
Honestly, never would've crossed my mind.

06:37.606 --> 06:40.317
So I was thinking, what's the next step?

06:40.400 --> 06:43.028
What if we made our safe space
for women...

06:45.030 --> 06:47.365
...also available to men?

06:47.449 --> 06:49.117
That's an untapped market.

06:49.200 --> 06:50.744
All right, then it's agreed.

06:50.827 --> 06:51.953
No goodbye?

06:52.037 --> 06:54.331
He's a conversational Amelia Earhart.

06:54.414 --> 06:58.960
Mr. Peanutbutter and
Captain Peanutbutter in the same room?

06:59.044 --> 07:01.630
What is this, a flashback episode?

07:01.713 --> 07:04.299
Captain Peanutbutter, you old so-and-so.

07:04.382 --> 07:06.426
- Get over here.
- Careful.

07:08.678 --> 07:10.472
Where's Mrs. Captain Peanutbutter?

07:10.555 --> 07:14.017
She's in Alaska running the Iditarod.
She sends her love.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.852
And this noogie.

07:15.936 --> 07:18.021
Whoo!

07:18.104 --> 07:20.398
Diane, this is my big brother.

07:20.482 --> 07:22.609
Big brother? I'm five minutes older.

07:22.692 --> 07:23.985
And you always will be.

07:24.069 --> 07:25.820
It's nice to meet you, Captain.

07:25.904 --> 07:29.032
Hey, put that thing away.
You're family.

07:29.115 --> 07:30.784
Oh!

07:34.037 --> 07:37.499
So David Pincher is about to shoot
the <i>Flight of the Pegasus</i> trilogy

07:37.582 --> 07:40.919
in New Zealand,
and BoJack is perfect for the lead.

07:41.002 --> 07:43.088
A part like that would really underline

07:43.171 --> 07:47.342
that BoJack's more than just an actor,
he's a movie star.

07:47.425 --> 07:49.552
If I'm doing that,
I conveniently won't be able

07:49.636 --> 07:51.388
to do that dumbass
<i>Ethan Around</i> show.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.139
Use that when you tell him I won't do it.

07:53.223 --> 07:54.891
Why don't you tell him
you don't want to do it?

07:54.975 --> 07:57.102
I can't. I'm like a father figure to him--

07:57.185 --> 07:58.603
I slept with his mother.

07:58.687 --> 07:59.604
- Gross.
- No.

07:59.688 --> 08:02.524
I slept with her 20 years ago.
She was young then, not gross.

08:02.607 --> 08:03.441
Ugh!

08:03.525 --> 08:06.569
Hey, loved you in
<i>The Caveman's Valentine.</i>

08:06.653 --> 08:08.530
- Hmm?
- Nothing? <i>The Caveman's Valentine?</i>

08:08.613 --> 08:11.408
Samuel L. Jackson had that big beard?
Look it up.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.243
- When you start laughing, call me.
- Will do.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.245
Do we have an offer
on the <i>Pegasus</i> movie?

08:15.328 --> 08:17.455
I'll get it, Kalamata.
Don't get your pita in a wad.

08:17.539 --> 08:19.833
Wow. <i>Flight of the Pegasus.</i>

08:19.916 --> 08:21.918
This must be
what Robert Downey Jr. felt like

08:22.002 --> 08:23.795
when he woke up on that
stranger's bathroom floor

08:23.878 --> 08:25.588
and found out he was gonna be Iron Man.

08:27.966 --> 08:31.928
<i>It's another unseasonably</i>
<i>warm day in the Labrador Peninsula</i>

08:32.012 --> 08:34.389
<i>and things are looking sunny</i>
<i>all the way to the new year.</i>

08:34.472 --> 08:35.974
<i>It really is true what they say...</i>

08:36.057 --> 08:38.893
Nothing bad ever happens
on the Labrador Peninsula.

08:38.977 --> 08:40.478
Oh, paradise.

08:56.411 --> 08:58.246
Uncle Mister. Uncle Mister.

08:58.329 --> 09:01.666
Now who let these little monsters
onto my peninsula?

09:01.750 --> 09:02.917
We're your nephews.

09:03.001 --> 09:07.130
What? I don't remember my nephews
being made out of candy.

09:07.213 --> 09:09.507
Gobble, gobble, gobble.

09:10.258 --> 09:14.012
Look at those children.
Little miracles, right?

09:14.095 --> 09:18.099
They're adorable, not that
I value them based on their looks.

09:18.183 --> 09:19.309
Because, of course,

09:19.392 --> 09:22.228
children in society today
are often reduced to their cuteness.

09:22.312 --> 09:25.315
I can't wait to get
to know your children as people,

09:25.398 --> 09:27.817
so I can specifically
compliment them individually

09:27.901 --> 09:30.028
on the foundation of their characters.

09:30.111 --> 09:33.406
Well, one day they'll die, just like us.

09:33.490 --> 09:34.324
Uh...

09:34.407 --> 09:36.242
- Do you believe in the soul?
- What?

09:36.326 --> 09:41.372
Life is the most precious resource
we have. Remember that, Diane.

09:41.456 --> 09:42.749
Okay.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.628
Pretty great, right?

09:46.711 --> 09:50.924
Did you tell your brother
about the A-B-O-R-T-I-O-N?

09:51.007 --> 09:53.718
The audition?
No, I could never tell him about that.

09:53.802 --> 09:56.054
He thinks I'm offer-only,
it would break his heart.

09:56.137 --> 09:57.263
Wait, what audition?

09:57.347 --> 10:00.433
- No, the abortion.
- Oh, no. Should I have?

10:00.517 --> 10:03.228
He said some weird stuff to me earlier.

10:03.311 --> 10:05.730
The kind of stuff you'd hear
in a sad Creed song.

10:05.814 --> 10:07.524
Or a happy Elliott Smith song.

10:07.607 --> 10:11.903
Oh, he's probably just razzing ya,
but he's a good dog. All bark, no bite.

10:11.986 --> 10:15.365
Sorry, that's a Labrador expression.
I guess in human terms it would be:

10:15.448 --> 10:19.369
He's all talk, and no shooting you
with an assault rifle.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.246
Is that what you think humans do?

10:21.329 --> 10:22.372
Am I wrong?

10:24.541 --> 10:27.001
Boom! This is David Pincher.

10:27.085 --> 10:30.505
And this is everyone who works for him.

10:30.588 --> 10:31.798
Now unfortunately for us,

10:31.881 --> 10:34.759
everyone on this board
must really like their boss's movies,

10:34.843 --> 10:38.763
because for the holidays,
they're all <i>Gone Girl.</i>

10:38.847 --> 10:41.641
Thank you, except for her. Boom.

10:41.724 --> 10:45.061
The assistant to David Pincher's
casting director.

10:45.145 --> 10:48.481
Wait a second, I know that face.
Why does she look so familiar?

10:49.357 --> 10:50.942
- Oh, fish.
- Oh, fish.

10:51.025 --> 10:54.154
So when I found out
that the best assistant I ever had

10:54.237 --> 10:55.947
was working for David Pincher,

10:56.030 --> 10:57.574
I mean, what are the odds?

10:57.657 --> 11:00.952
Did he hire you because of your cute
little Benjamin Button-nose?

11:01.035 --> 11:04.539
I'll put in a good word for BoJack,
but I'm just an assistant.

11:04.622 --> 11:08.001
Just an assistant?
Laura, assistants are everything.

11:08.084 --> 11:10.336
You're the first people in,
the last people out.

11:10.420 --> 11:13.089
You know everyone's real name, age,
nose, teeth, and tits.

11:13.172 --> 11:17.510
You have power, because in today's economy
the only true power is information.

11:17.594 --> 11:19.470
I want you to use that power.

11:19.554 --> 11:22.891
I want you to get your boss
to pick BoJack as his Pegasus.

11:22.974 --> 11:24.934
I always believed in you, Laura.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.353
The question is:
do you believe in yourself?

11:27.437 --> 11:30.064
Wow, that's--
I'm sorry, did you just make that up?

11:30.148 --> 11:33.067
Because that was--
Is that a speech you had ready to go?

11:33.151 --> 11:35.278
- Will you do this for me?
- Of course.

11:35.361 --> 11:38.364
You went to bat for me when I tried
to get a promotion at Vigor.

11:38.448 --> 11:41.826
I pushed so hard for you.
I did everything I could.

11:41.910 --> 11:44.787
I mean, we gals gotta look out
for each other. Right?

11:44.871 --> 11:45.997
Right.

11:51.294 --> 11:52.754
So you're talking about a merger?

11:52.837 --> 11:55.673
Since my dad croaked
I've been running Vigor myself,

11:55.757 --> 11:59.135
and I've been doing a pretty good job,
A-minus/B-plus.

11:59.218 --> 12:02.931
But I could use a few more experienced
hands to help guide the ship,

12:03.014 --> 12:07.477
- because being a boss is really hard.
- Yes.

12:07.560 --> 12:10.730
Princess Carolyn can be a proud woman.
I'm glad you came to me first.

12:10.813 --> 12:12.523
I would have gone to her directly,

12:12.607 --> 12:15.777
but sometimes she yells at me
and I do not like being yelled at

12:15.860 --> 12:18.863
and that is just something that people
need to understand about me.

12:18.947 --> 12:21.157
I'll talk to her, when the time is right.

12:24.077 --> 12:29.958
So on the new show Ethan is the dad,
and he's raising three little horses.

12:30.041 --> 12:32.126
You couldn't have told me
this over the phone?

12:32.210 --> 12:34.545
This show is going to change my life.

12:34.629 --> 12:37.674
I'm taking the kids out of school
and moving everyone down here.

12:37.757 --> 12:40.218
I just had an offer accepted
on a house in Sherman Oaks.

12:40.301 --> 12:43.012
As long as I don't change my mind
before the new year, boom.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.472
Two million dollars, gone.

12:44.555 --> 12:46.391
- The new year? That's tonight.
- I know.

12:46.474 --> 12:48.476
Did you talk to my agent
by any chance?

12:48.559 --> 12:49.811
- No.
- She didn't call you?

12:49.894 --> 12:52.939
I talked to her, and I don't know
if she wants me to do it.

12:53.022 --> 12:54.315
You know how agents are.

12:54.399 --> 12:56.567
Just remember,
I'm not the bad guy here.

12:56.651 --> 12:58.277
I hear you loud and clear.

12:58.361 --> 13:00.405
Don't worry.
We won't take no for an answer.

13:00.488 --> 13:03.491
I think my schedule's gonna be tough--
Might be going to New Zealand.

13:03.574 --> 13:05.034
We'll work around your schedule.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.412
Those bastards got my quote
so damn high.

13:07.495 --> 13:09.831
We'll pay it.
No obstacle is insurmountable.

13:09.914 --> 13:13.126
- As long as you want to do it.
- And I do want to do it.

13:13.209 --> 13:14.502
Get me out of this thing.

13:14.585 --> 13:17.380
This asshole's giving me everything
I ask for. What a nightmare.

13:17.463 --> 13:20.842
- Tell him you don't want to do the show.
- I can't. It would destroy him.

13:20.925 --> 13:23.011
Destroying people is what I pay you to do,

13:23.094 --> 13:25.346
so I don't think about the people
I'm destroying.

13:25.430 --> 13:27.432
Do you not know what an agent is?

13:27.515 --> 13:30.018
BoJack, are you okay in there?

13:30.101 --> 13:32.020
Is it number one or number two?

13:35.440 --> 13:38.818
That cat's running circles around us.
What are we going to do?

13:38.901 --> 13:41.904
Maybe we can distract her?
I'm thinking laser pointer.

13:41.988 --> 13:45.116
If we're going to beat her,
we need to think like her.

13:45.199 --> 13:48.870
Instead of convincing the <i>Pegasus</i>
people they don't want BoJack,

13:48.953 --> 13:51.330
what if we convince BoJack
he doesn't want <i>Pegasus?</i>

13:51.414 --> 13:53.916
Fantastic. How do we do that?

13:54.000 --> 13:55.043
Kelsey.

13:55.126 --> 13:58.504
Kelsey? That's what I said when
they said you wanted to meet with me.

13:58.588 --> 14:00.256
I figured you never wanted
to see me again.

14:00.339 --> 14:01.716
I never want to see anyone again,

14:01.799 --> 14:05.344
but there's a book I've been trying
to turn into a movie and I need your help.

14:05.428 --> 14:09.390
It's a coming-of-age story
about a girl who likes jellybeans.

14:09.474 --> 14:11.100
The option expires tonight at midnight,

14:11.184 --> 14:13.978
unless I can find a big enough star
to secure funding.

14:14.062 --> 14:15.646
Frankly, I already gave up on it.

14:15.730 --> 14:18.191
Then my agent said,
"Maybe BoJack's interested."

14:18.274 --> 14:20.360
So the reason
you think I'm right for the role

14:20.443 --> 14:22.445
is because I'm a big enough star
to secure funding?

14:22.528 --> 14:25.031
Don't get smart, BoJack.
You're not good at it.

14:25.114 --> 14:26.616
You're really giving the hard sell here.

14:26.699 --> 14:30.203
I hear they've got you locked in
to some fantasy dystopia thing.

14:30.286 --> 14:33.081
Are you just gonna do stupid bullshit
for the rest of your life?

14:33.164 --> 14:34.749
For work or, like, in general?

14:34.832 --> 14:37.460
I saw something in you,
something most people don't know you have,

14:37.543 --> 14:40.171
and it kills me that instead
of sharing it with the world,

14:40.254 --> 14:43.508
you want to hide it under some
wonderland unicorn nonsense.

14:43.591 --> 14:46.010
It's a Pegasus. Unicorns are for babies.

14:46.094 --> 14:48.179
The movie I want to make
isn't glamorous or sexy.

14:48.262 --> 14:50.556
You don't get to be the big hero
everybody loves.

14:50.640 --> 14:52.850
You get to be a guy
who works at a gas station,

14:52.934 --> 14:55.269
who gets in a fight with his daughter
about jellybeans.

14:55.353 --> 14:58.314
That's the whole movie.
It's small and it's real.

14:58.398 --> 15:01.776
And you'd get to work
with a director who sees you.

15:01.859 --> 15:04.779
And I can't sell it any better than that.

15:04.862 --> 15:07.532
You're right, that one scene
we shot that didn't even make it

15:07.615 --> 15:10.076
into the <i>Secretariat </i>movie
was the best thing I ever did.

15:10.159 --> 15:12.620
Why am I wasting my time
with this other stuff?

15:12.703 --> 15:14.205
- So you're in?
- Let's do it.

15:14.288 --> 15:16.833
Great. How's your little friend
with the face?

15:16.916 --> 15:19.210
Is he up to his old tricks,
getting into scrapes?

15:19.293 --> 15:22.130
What a little scamp.
Will you tell him I said hi?

15:26.843 --> 15:28.636
Kelsey's movie sounds perfect.

15:28.719 --> 15:32.640
Is it the nobody's-gonna-see-it element
or the fact you'll be working for peanuts?

15:32.723 --> 15:36.394
This jellybean thing could show the world
that BoJack's more than just a movie star.

15:36.477 --> 15:38.646
- He's an actor.
- Yeah, well, that's great,

15:38.729 --> 15:41.315
but I've been working all day
on getting him the <i>Pegasus </i>movie

15:41.399 --> 15:43.651
you said would show the world
he's a movie star.

15:43.734 --> 15:46.571
I don't want that anymore.
I want to do something real.

15:46.654 --> 15:48.990
You realize how much money
we'd be walking away from?

15:49.073 --> 15:50.741
This isn't about money.
Doesn't matter to me.

15:50.825 --> 15:53.828
- Yeah, it doesn't matter to you.
- Right. So what's the problem?

15:53.911 --> 15:56.164
Maybe you can find a way
for BoJack to do both?

15:56.247 --> 15:59.417
You're supposed to be
this amazing agent, after all.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.252
I'll see what I can do.

16:04.839 --> 16:07.216
New beers for the new year's?

16:07.300 --> 16:10.344
We got a regular
Maya Angelou over here.

16:10.428 --> 16:12.180
Good times.

16:12.263 --> 16:14.307
Oh, it's Todd. Gotta take this.

16:14.390 --> 16:16.934
- Maybe you can call him back later?
- Todd!

16:17.018 --> 16:20.146
Don't be too long,
or I'm gonna drink all your beer.

16:20.229 --> 16:24.484
Diane, do you ever look up at the stars

16:24.567 --> 16:27.445
and feel like
they're tiny holes in the sky,

16:27.528 --> 16:30.531
sucking out all the oxygen,
and suddenly you can't breathe

16:30.615 --> 16:34.911
because you're thinking about how small
you are and how meaningless it all is?

16:34.994 --> 16:37.288
Uh... I guess.

16:37.371 --> 16:39.707
It's so cruel to let people love you.

16:39.790 --> 16:44.587
All you're doing is promising
you'll one day break their hearts.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.339
Cool fire pit.

16:47.965 --> 16:53.721
So it turns out men love safe spaces
for women even more than women do.

16:53.804 --> 16:57.183
You gotta read some of these comments.
Queefburglar69 says:

16:57.266 --> 17:01.521
"These sexy lady chauffeurs
always get me where I need to go."

17:01.604 --> 17:03.147
That's unambiguous.

17:03.231 --> 17:06.484
The only problem is some of the drivers
have been complaining

17:06.567 --> 17:08.110
about the new customer base.

17:08.194 --> 17:12.240
The workers are allowed to complain?
We gotta tighten up that ship.

17:12.323 --> 17:14.825
Most of the new passengers
are perfect gentlemen,

17:14.909 --> 17:17.828
but we've found that a growing number
are rating our drivers

17:17.912 --> 17:21.165
not on performance but on "bangability",

17:21.249 --> 17:25.086
which creates an unfair advantage
for our "bangable" drivers

17:25.169 --> 17:29.048
and creates what some
of our more homely employees

17:29.131 --> 17:34.011
have dubbed a hostile sexy-ocracy.
Whoa!

17:34.095 --> 17:38.099
Well, our first priority is creating
a safe space for women,

17:38.182 --> 17:40.476
so if our women
don't feel safe in that space,

17:40.560 --> 17:42.770
we should replace them
with women who do.

17:42.853 --> 17:47.942
Where can we find women who are
comfortable around gentlemen?

17:48.025 --> 17:50.278
I know. A gentleman's club.

17:50.361 --> 17:51.404
That's perfect.

17:51.487 --> 17:53.197
To Whale World.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.159
Well, you didn't hear it from me,

17:57.243 --> 17:59.453
but I pulled some strings and you're in.

17:59.537 --> 18:01.247
I always knew you were a superstar.

18:01.330 --> 18:02.790
Let's get drinks in the new year

18:02.873 --> 18:05.209
and work out the deets--
That's a fast way of saying details

18:05.293 --> 18:08.462
for people who don't have time
for every detail of the word details.

18:08.546 --> 18:09.880
Vanessa Gekko on line two.

18:09.964 --> 18:11.882
Great, put that raggedy-ass bitch on.

18:11.966 --> 18:14.343
I'm gonna bat her around
like a ball of foil.

18:14.427 --> 18:18.097
I know you're excited, but we are still
in a very precarious position,

18:18.180 --> 18:21.601
and I wonder if foil-ball-batting
is the best tack here.

18:21.684 --> 18:24.604
Judah, this is where I live.
Watch and learn.

18:24.687 --> 18:28.357
Hey, we heard BoJack and Kelsey
had a great meeting on <i>Jelly Belle.</i>

18:28.441 --> 18:30.735
Gotta tie this up tonight
if it's going to happen.

18:30.818 --> 18:32.445
BoJack would love to do the movie,

18:32.528 --> 18:35.281
but you're gonna have to work
around his <i>Pegasus</i> schedule.

18:35.364 --> 18:37.825
Oh, um... That might be tricky.

18:37.908 --> 18:39.952
Then you're gonna have to match
his <i>Pegasus </i>quote.

18:40.036 --> 18:43.122
- He won't do it for a penny less.
- Princess Carolyn--

18:43.205 --> 18:46.375
Even with a star like BoJack,
Kelsey can't get that kind of money.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.002
Well, then, work around his schedule.

18:48.085 --> 18:51.589
You're overplaying your hand, PC,
and I'm calling your bluff.

18:51.672 --> 18:55.134
I'm barreling towards you fast, Gekko,
and this Mack truck ain't gonna blink.

18:55.217 --> 18:58.137
That's not fair. I was clearly
establishing a poker metaphor,

18:58.220 --> 19:00.264
you just changed it to a game of chicken.

19:00.348 --> 19:01.641
My court. My rules.

19:01.724 --> 19:03.684
Court? What game are you playing?

19:03.768 --> 19:04.977
Bye.

19:05.061 --> 19:06.854
- Damn it!
- Question:

19:06.937 --> 19:09.940
Am I the faulty bike tire pump
I had in seventh grade?

19:10.024 --> 19:12.693
Because I just blew this thing wide open.

19:12.777 --> 19:15.237
- Talk to me, soldier.
- I have been scouring old emails.

19:15.321 --> 19:18.240
I didn't know what I was looking for.
I knew there was something.

19:18.324 --> 19:20.576
And I found it. Bam!

19:20.660 --> 19:25.206
Hot shit on a ham sandwich,
this is amazing!

19:26.290 --> 19:29.585
Sweet crap on a croissant,
Katie's going into labor!

19:29.669 --> 19:32.838
Go, I'll take care of this.
Family comes first.

19:32.922 --> 19:35.091
Thank you. You make me stronger.

19:39.762 --> 19:42.223
Why is my house filled with sexy orcas?

19:42.306 --> 19:46.769
It's the Cabracadabra New Year's party.
These are our drivers.

19:46.852 --> 19:48.688
Oh. Uh, where's Emily?

19:48.771 --> 19:51.774
She left.
She said she didn't feel comfortable here.

19:51.857 --> 19:55.152
She certainly didn't feel comfortable
paying for the food she ate.

19:55.236 --> 19:58.114
Yeah, okay, BoJack.

20:00.533 --> 20:03.869
I got champagne for my real friends,
'cause that's what you are.

20:03.953 --> 20:05.996
- A real friend.
- He doesn't want to do your show.

20:06.080 --> 20:08.040
- What?
- BoJack is about to win an Oscar.

20:08.124 --> 20:10.584
Why do you think he would want
to do your soon-to-fail sitcom

20:10.668 --> 20:13.462
about the further adventures
of a carb-faced nobody?

20:13.546 --> 20:15.923
- Oh, maybe--
- You are not a television star.

20:16.006 --> 20:20.136
You have no talent and I am forgetting
your face even as I'm looking at it.

20:20.219 --> 20:22.054
Pack your bags.
Go back to Nowheresville.

20:22.138 --> 20:26.517
Thank you for the champagne.
Best regards, Ana Spanakopita.

20:29.103 --> 20:32.189
Oh, God, the house!
I gotta pull my deposit! Pick up--

20:32.273 --> 20:34.650
Oh, no. I dropped my phone in a bog.

20:37.069 --> 20:40.281
Something is going on with your brother.
You need to talk to him.

20:40.364 --> 20:43.659
We don't really have the kind of
relationship where we talk about things.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.411
Labs prefer to keep things playful.

20:45.494 --> 20:48.998
You know what they say about dogs?
Talking to each other is rrruff.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.750
I'm serious, Mr. Peanutbutter.

20:50.833 --> 20:53.836
And I'm serious that you should drop it.

20:53.919 --> 20:56.422
If something was really wrong,
he would tell me about it.

20:56.505 --> 20:57.339
Would he?

20:57.423 --> 20:59.800
I know he's your brother,
but he's hiding something from you.

20:59.884 --> 21:02.178
Why do you think you know my brother
better than I do?

21:02.261 --> 21:04.597
Just because you have a shitty
relationship with your family

21:04.680 --> 21:07.558
doesn't mean every other family
has to have drama too.

21:07.641 --> 21:09.477
I wanted to come up here
and have a nice time.

21:09.560 --> 21:11.103
This place is an escape for me.

21:11.187 --> 21:14.064
- Okay, I'm sorry, I just--
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

21:14.148 --> 21:16.734
I should not have shouted at you.
I just...

21:16.817 --> 21:18.861
I need to go for a walk.

21:23.908 --> 21:27.453
- Oh, hey.
- Hey, is there something going on?

21:27.536 --> 21:30.956
Because I know there isn't,
but if there is, you would tell me, right?

21:31.040 --> 21:32.541
But there's nothing to tell,

21:32.625 --> 21:35.419
because nothing bad ever happens
on the Labrador Peninsula.

21:35.503 --> 21:38.297
- Okay, I think you should sit down.
- Why?

21:38.380 --> 21:41.091
- I need to talk to you. Sit down.
- I will not sit down.

21:41.175 --> 21:43.344
- Mr. Peanutbutter, sit.
- Okay.

21:44.345 --> 21:47.139
- I got a twisted spleen.
- No.

21:47.223 --> 21:50.017
It's not fatal, necessarily.
Everything's gonna be fine.

21:50.100 --> 21:51.936
They still have to run some tests.

21:52.019 --> 21:54.313
- But it's going to be fine?
- Yeah.

21:54.396 --> 21:56.732
Promise me it's going to be fine?
You're my big brother.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.859
That means you can't lie to me about this.

21:58.943 --> 22:03.197
Mr. Peanutbutter, you are the best
runt of the litter a guy could ask for.

22:03.280 --> 22:04.448
No, don't do this.

22:04.532 --> 22:06.909
- But there might come a time...
- Please.

22:06.992 --> 22:10.037
...when you're going
to have to be the captain.

22:11.956 --> 22:14.458
What is this, a very special episode?

22:29.682 --> 22:31.684
What? What do you mean?
What happened?

22:31.767 --> 22:33.936
It's a no-go on BoJack for <i>Pegasus.</i>

22:34.019 --> 22:35.479
<i>I don't understand, Laura. I...</i>

22:35.563 --> 22:38.941
I just wanted you to know.
I did everything I could.

22:44.280 --> 22:45.698
- Hey.
<i>- Look...</i>

22:45.781 --> 22:48.951
If you didn't wanna do my movie,
you should have just told me.

22:49.034 --> 22:50.744
I do want to do your movie.

22:50.828 --> 22:53.289
Oh, yeah? Why did your agent
keep demanding more money?

22:53.372 --> 22:55.916
<i>- What?</i>
- The option's expired and I'm screwed.

22:56.000 --> 23:00.462
Ugh! Why did I get my hopes up?
Why do I keep letting you get my hopes up?

23:00.546 --> 23:01.714
Kelsey, this is a mistake.

23:01.797 --> 23:04.466
It's a mistake I keep making.
Next time, BoJack?

23:04.550 --> 23:07.052
Do a girl a favor,
don't break her heart by inches.

23:07.136 --> 23:09.888
Do it all at once.
It'll save everyone some time.

23:09.972 --> 23:11.307
Huh?

23:11.390 --> 23:14.435
Ten, nine, eight...

23:16.312 --> 23:17.813
Oh, good, you're still here.

23:17.896 --> 23:20.482
I wanted to get a head start
on the 2016 budget.

23:20.566 --> 23:22.776
It'll be a challenge, but assuming
BoJack books <i>Pegasus--</i>

23:22.860 --> 23:24.612
BoJack didn't book <i>Pegasus.</i>

23:24.695 --> 23:27.698
- So he's doing the jellybean movie?
- That fell apart, too.

23:27.781 --> 23:29.491
We're gonna have to cut some costs.

23:29.575 --> 23:32.411
Our social media division
is a luxury we can no longer afford.

23:32.494 --> 23:35.831
If things don't perk up the first quarter,
we might be looking at broader layoffs.

23:35.914 --> 23:39.418
- Do you ever read a room?
- I'm sorry, is this a bad time?

23:39.501 --> 23:42.880
Is midnight on New Year's a bad time?
I don't know.

23:42.963 --> 23:45.424
Why don't you run that through
your robot analysis protocol?

23:45.507 --> 23:47.509
Get back to me
once you've assessed the data.

23:47.593 --> 23:49.970
I am not a robot. I am a human being.

23:50.054 --> 23:53.015
You want to make some cuts?
Why don't you cut that stupid beard?

23:53.098 --> 23:56.268
Everyone who walks in here thinks
this place is run by a homeless person.

23:56.352 --> 23:59.438
I apologize if my appearance
or demeanor is unprofessional.

23:59.521 --> 24:04.818
No, you're perfect.
Everybody's perfect except for me.

24:04.902 --> 24:05.986
Go home, Judah.

24:06.070 --> 24:09.156
- Would you like me to shave the beard?
- Just go home, Judah.

24:10.991 --> 24:12.868
Happy New Year, Princess Carolyn.

24:31.595 --> 24:35.015
Hello, little ones. Mama loves you.

24:35.099 --> 24:37.434
And you. And you. And you.

24:37.518 --> 24:40.521
- They're so beautiful.
- And you, and you, and you.

24:40.604 --> 24:42.523
- Rutabaga, we got it.
- Yeah?

24:42.606 --> 24:46.694
Chuff Hollister is the new Pegasus.
We saved the agency.

24:46.777 --> 24:50.197
- That's incredible, honey.
- Wow, everything worked out.

24:50.280 --> 24:52.825
You gotta love a happy ending.
