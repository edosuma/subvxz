WEBVTT

00:01.501 --> 00:04.045
-JOYCE: <i>Just change it.</i>
-FRANK: <i>I don't have time.</i>

00:04.129 --> 00:06.756
-Sure you do.
-What's wrong with it?

00:06.840 --> 00:09.342
Something about it, the width.

00:10.176 --> 00:11.678
The vest would have covered it.

00:12.137 --> 00:14.389
It's not anything anybody
was gonna notice in court.

00:14.973 --> 00:16.808
For me it's déjà vu.

00:16.891 --> 00:18.560
You wore it at the first trial,

00:18.643 --> 00:20.645
the day Biomonte skipped the country.

00:20.729 --> 00:22.230
-You really noticed?
-Mm-hm.

00:22.313 --> 00:25.233
-I'm flattered.
-(laughs) Don't be.

00:25.316 --> 00:27.152
You're lucky I don't judge
a man by his tie.

00:27.235 --> 00:28.737
I know I'm lucky.

00:31.239 --> 00:32.323
(Joyce moans)

00:34.743 --> 00:40.540
Item six: federal investigation
into local meat-handling practices.

00:40.623 --> 00:43.418
Illegal sales of inferior pork bellies

00:43.501 --> 00:44.711
have been traced to--

00:44.794 --> 00:48.423
The corner of Decker and 125th.
I know her, Sarge.

00:48.506 --> 00:50.050
(scattered groans, laughter)

00:50.133 --> 00:50.967
Anyway,

00:51.051 --> 00:54.512
Mick Belker is working an undercover
at Korloff's Packing Plant,

00:54.596 --> 00:56.931
coordinating with people
from the Health Department.

00:57.015 --> 01:01.102
Item seven: the retrial of Al Biomonte

01:01.186 --> 01:03.188
begins in earnest today.

01:03.271 --> 01:06.775
Just like with those Nazis,
this mafia kingpin

01:06.858 --> 01:08.610
thought he could skip out on justice.

01:08.693 --> 01:11.196
But even though it took
seven years, they got him.

01:11.279 --> 01:13.364
He's been extradited from Palermo.

01:13.448 --> 01:15.658
The captain is testifying
against him today.

01:15.742 --> 01:17.660
Item eight: relates insomuch

01:17.744 --> 01:20.872
as Lieutenant Hunter takes station command
in the captain's absence.

01:20.955 --> 01:25.043
Last item:
if you can sing, if you can dance,

01:25.126 --> 01:29.339
if you can play an instrument,
tell jokes, juggle, do magic,

01:29.422 --> 01:34.135
you ought to sign up for the PBA
Dependents' Fund Amateur Night.

01:34.219 --> 01:36.888
-RENKO: Hey, right here!
-Now people-- people--

01:36.971 --> 01:38.807
The Hill and the Heights are responsible

01:38.890 --> 01:41.559
for raising this money
for the widows and the orphans.

01:41.643 --> 01:43.478
So if you got any talent,

01:43.561 --> 01:46.147
for heaven's sake,
get out there tonight and flaunt it,

01:46.231 --> 01:49.025
because we want to have a great show, huh?

01:49.109 --> 01:51.194
Okay, that's all I got.

01:51.277 --> 01:52.362
Let's move!

01:52.445 --> 01:54.489
Stop them from getting away out there.

01:54.572 --> 01:56.699
(indistinct chatter)

01:56.783 --> 01:57.951
(telephone ringing)

01:58.034 --> 01:59.702
You see, it's not just the voice.

01:59.786 --> 02:02.497
It's what the singer does
with the words of the song.

02:02.580 --> 02:04.457
-It's called <i>phrasing.</i>
-Phrasing.

02:04.541 --> 02:08.336
Sarge, listen, in reference
to this talent thing I'm hearing about,

02:08.419 --> 02:10.505
I'm not the kind of guy
who blows his own horn,

02:10.588 --> 02:12.423
but people tell me I'm kind of funny.

02:12.507 --> 02:13.633
You mean jokes?

02:13.716 --> 02:15.718
Yeah, I got some great ones.

02:15.802 --> 02:19.013
I don't know, Lieutenant. There's gonna be
wives and kids at this thing.

02:19.097 --> 02:22.267
Hey, listen, Stan, I'm not talking
about that kind of stuff.

02:22.350 --> 02:23.434
I mean harmless things.

02:23.518 --> 02:26.229
You know, like Polish jokes. (chuckles)

02:26.312 --> 02:28.731
<i>♪ God bless America ♪</i>

02:28.815 --> 02:31.734
You know, see, now, that's real boring.
But now listen to this.

02:31.818 --> 02:36.990
<i>♪ Go-o-d bless A-mer-ica ♪</i>

02:37.615 --> 02:42.245
<i>♪ Land that I lo-o-ve ♪</i>

02:42.328 --> 02:45.540
Now, I have just taken a standard song
and imbued it with phrasing

02:45.623 --> 02:47.500
-making it distinctly my own.
-No question.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.169
(continues singing)

02:49.252 --> 02:51.504
With regard to press inquiries

02:51.588 --> 02:54.048
that might come
regarding the Biomonte trial?

02:54.132 --> 02:55.425
We have no comment, Howard.

02:55.508 --> 02:57.468
Any press releases come out of Division.

02:57.552 --> 02:59.554
Well, I just want to give you
the final assurance

02:59.637 --> 03:01.639
that during my brevet of command,

03:01.723 --> 03:05.059
that I shall do everything to maintain
the continuum of order.

03:05.143 --> 03:06.519
I'm not worried, Howard.

03:06.603 --> 03:09.314
(telephone ringing)

03:10.523 --> 03:11.649
-Morning, Frank.
-Irwin.

03:11.733 --> 03:13.318
Henry, did we get it all?

03:13.401 --> 03:15.403
17 pieces
of physical evidence are on their way

03:15.486 --> 03:17.697
-from the vaults at Farmingdale.
-Statement files?

03:17.780 --> 03:19.157
Complete and up-to-date.

03:19.240 --> 03:20.742
(grunts)

03:20.825 --> 03:21.784
Gentlemen.

03:23.119 --> 03:25.830
-Take you back, Frank?
-Seven years.

03:25.914 --> 03:27.999
Considering what I read
in this morning's paper,

03:28.082 --> 03:30.543
this case could be a couple
of rungs on your ladder.

03:30.627 --> 03:31.544
How about it?

03:31.628 --> 03:33.588
Planning on extra mileage from Biomonte?

03:33.671 --> 03:35.381
What are you referring to now?

03:35.465 --> 03:38.218
The current rumor's
finally made it into print.

03:38.301 --> 03:40.261
Today's editorial page describes you

03:40.345 --> 03:41.721
as a viable candidate for mayor.

03:41.804 --> 03:43.681
I've been approached by some people.

03:43.765 --> 03:46.517
-I haven't agreed to run for anything.
-Of course not.

03:47.727 --> 03:49.938
And he whines that we play the press.

03:50.438 --> 03:51.814
REPORTER: Hey, it's Daniels!

03:51.898 --> 03:53.274
Excuse me, Chief Daniels?

03:53.358 --> 03:55.693
(reporters clamoring)

03:55.777 --> 03:57.654
Mr. Biomonte claims
the charges against him

03:57.737 --> 04:00.198
will be invalidated
by the statute of limitations.

04:00.281 --> 04:01.908
Ridiculous. The statute doesn't run

04:01.991 --> 04:03.868
when you flee the country
to avoid prosecution.

04:03.952 --> 04:07.413
He also says the passing of time has
diminished the importance of this case.

04:07.497 --> 04:08.498
Talk to the widow--

04:08.581 --> 04:09.999
REPORTER: Do you think this case

04:10.083 --> 04:12.001
-will enhance your prospects--
-(faint gunshot)

04:12.085 --> 04:13.461
(racket)

04:13.544 --> 04:15.380
-Frank, what is it?
-I heard a shot.

04:15.463 --> 04:17.048
(overlapping shouts)

04:17.131 --> 04:18.258
MAN: Get down!

04:19.592 --> 04:21.386
Stand back!

04:21.469 --> 04:23.221
-(clamoring)
-(overlapping shouts)

04:23.304 --> 04:25.515
Get back! Get back, all of you!

04:25.598 --> 04:27.225
For God's sake, call the paramedics!

04:27.308 --> 04:28.685
(shouting)

04:28.768 --> 04:30.728
Oh, my God. My God!

04:32.188 --> 04:34.649
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

04:34.732 --> 04:36.859
<i>-Armed robbery in progress.</i>
-(sirens whooping)

04:36.943 --> 04:40.780
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner of People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

04:40.863 --> 04:42.365
(theme music plays)

05:48.806 --> 05:51.017
(upbeat music playing)

05:56.481 --> 05:59.484
(sirens wailing in the distance)

06:08.034 --> 06:12.622
-(siren wailing)
-(tires screech)

06:15.208 --> 06:17.001
(indistinct radio chatter)

06:24.050 --> 06:27.303
We don't have a choice.
We've got to go inside and fast.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.055
-I'm gonna call his wife.
-God yes.

06:29.138 --> 06:30.890
-She mustn't hear it on the news.
-What can I tell her?

06:30.973 --> 06:33.393
I can't make any prognosis.
It's minute by minute.

06:35.103 --> 06:37.188
Officer, let me use your VA-10.

06:37.271 --> 06:40.775
Dispatch? Chief Daniels.
I've got a code 11.

06:40.858 --> 06:42.610
Patch me through to Captain Scapizzi.

06:42.693 --> 06:44.070
Yes, very urgent.

06:44.862 --> 06:46.864
No, I don't want anyone
taking a message to her.

06:46.948 --> 06:48.533
I got to talk to her myself.

06:48.616 --> 06:49.659
She's in court.

06:49.742 --> 06:51.369
We don't know yet, Gene. It looks bad.

06:51.452 --> 06:53.621
-Round-the-clock guards on him.
-GENE: <i>Biomonte?</i>

06:53.704 --> 06:55.331
There's no question in my mind.

06:55.415 --> 06:56.791
A good chance he'll try again.

06:56.874 --> 06:58.501
Hey, Luce, you got to help me.

06:58.584 --> 07:00.336
I can't do half my tricks.

07:00.420 --> 07:03.214
I can't do the rabbits.
I can't do the doves.

07:03.297 --> 07:05.258
I can't do the sword in the box.

07:05.341 --> 07:07.009
-I need an assistant.
-All right.

07:07.093 --> 07:08.928
But I'm not wearing black tights. Got it?

07:09.011 --> 07:11.681
DISPATCH: <i>We have</i>
<i>a reported shooting of a police officer</i>

07:11.764 --> 07:13.558
<i>at the Municipal Courts Building.</i>

07:16.185 --> 07:17.854
Yeah, do we have the officer's name?

07:17.937 --> 07:19.147
<i>Captain Furillo.</i>

07:21.023 --> 07:22.150
Oh, boy.

07:22.233 --> 07:24.777
JOYCE: There are countless
errors in translation

07:24.861 --> 07:27.238
and a total confusion of the facts.

07:27.321 --> 07:31.409
I would therefore ask the court
that this document be stricken from use.

07:33.578 --> 07:36.205
Ms. Davenport, the bailiff
has just handed me a note.

07:36.289 --> 07:40.084
You have an emergency phone call
from a Lieutenant Henry Goldblume.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.341
MAN: They shot the Chief of Police?

07:47.425 --> 07:49.010
No, it was the other guy.

07:49.093 --> 07:52.013
Furillo. Right in front of the court.

07:52.096 --> 07:53.306
-(thud)
-Sniper.

07:53.389 --> 07:56.434
Hey, pick up your pig!
Nobody drops meat around here.

07:57.185 --> 07:58.978
-(growls)
-You crazy?

07:59.061 --> 08:01.314
RADIO REPORTER: <i>It's believed</i>
<i>a man on the roof of the courthouse</i>

08:01.397 --> 08:03.524
<i>fired the shot</i>
<i>which struck Captain Furillo.</i>

08:03.608 --> 08:07.653
<i>-Early reports coming in...</i>
-Oh, my God. Oh, no.

08:07.737 --> 08:09.197
(radio reporter goes on)

08:09.280 --> 08:13.201
-(machine buzzes)
-(monitor beeping)

08:16.287 --> 08:17.663
Any increase in blood pressure?

08:17.747 --> 08:19.665
-WOMAN: Up three and holding.
-Rib spreader.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.879
Now people are gonna
want to rush down there.

08:24.962 --> 08:26.589
So, uh, we're gonna...

08:27.715 --> 08:32.470
We're gonna have to work out a system
of shifts by twos and according to roster.

08:33.429 --> 08:35.139
Uh, yes, yes.

08:35.223 --> 08:38.184
Now, I'm gonna pass the word to discourage

08:38.267 --> 08:40.311
individual phone calls to the hospital.

08:40.394 --> 08:41.854
That's just gonna tie things up.

08:41.938 --> 08:44.232
I'll check with the doctors
and post bulletins.

08:44.315 --> 08:45.816
-Is that okay?
-Yes.

08:46.275 --> 08:49.028
A lot of people are gonna
want to donate blood.

08:49.111 --> 08:49.946
So, uh,

08:50.488 --> 08:53.699
you know, help make up
what the hospital puts out.

08:53.783 --> 08:55.451
So I'm gonna be checking blood types.

08:55.535 --> 08:58.246
Anybody matches the captain's
gonna go first,

08:58.329 --> 08:59.789
in case they need direct donors.

08:59.872 --> 09:02.041
Are you, uh, you okay, Lieutenant?

09:02.124 --> 09:05.127
-(clears throat) No.
-What's the matter?

09:05.211 --> 09:07.922
-I just can't seem to think straight.
-I know what you mean.

09:08.631 --> 09:10.216
I'm fighting to keep on track myself.

09:10.299 --> 09:12.009
But we got to take care of things.

09:12.093 --> 09:13.344
Can't let him down.

09:15.263 --> 09:16.180
Yes.

09:17.390 --> 09:18.432
(sighs)

09:19.433 --> 09:20.935
You're right, Sergeant. Thank you.

09:21.018 --> 09:23.062
(telephone ringing)

09:23.145 --> 09:25.147
(monitor beeping)

09:25.231 --> 09:26.566
I can still feel bone chips.

09:26.649 --> 09:27.817
Suction.

09:27.900 --> 09:30.778
(indistinct chatter)

09:30.861 --> 09:32.905
-(vacuuming)
-Right. Follow my finger now.

09:32.989 --> 09:33.823
That's good.

09:33.906 --> 09:37.702
(sighs) Saline. Flush the whole area.

09:38.828 --> 09:41.872
This is a mess down here.
What's his blood pressure?

09:41.956 --> 09:44.083
-WOMAN: Sixty-three.
-Damn.

09:47.878 --> 09:49.130
I'm Mrs. Furillo.

09:51.632 --> 09:53.342
-How is he?
-Still in surgery.

09:53.426 --> 09:56.095
-It's been almost an hour.
-What happened?

09:56.178 --> 09:58.681
The radio said it was a sniper
on the roof of the courthouse.

09:58.764 --> 10:01.225
Somebody shot from the crowd
with a silenced gun.

10:01.309 --> 10:02.685
Couldn't be more than five feet.

10:02.768 --> 10:04.228
-We don't know that.
-I heard it.

10:04.312 --> 10:06.564
I know the sound of a silenced gun.
I didn't hear it.

10:07.481 --> 10:09.900
I was next to him,
closer than we are right now.

10:10.860 --> 10:14.322
I promise, I swear to you.
We'll get whoever did this.

10:14.405 --> 10:15.781
Dr. Mendelsohn.

10:15.865 --> 10:17.700
This is Captain Furillo's wife.

10:18.242 --> 10:19.452
I'll come right to the point.

10:19.952 --> 10:21.912
Captain Furillo has suffered severe injury

10:21.996 --> 10:23.914
to the vascular system
surrounding the heart

10:23.998 --> 10:25.791
and is in a deep state of shock.

10:25.875 --> 10:29.337
Now we have repaired the damage
as much as possible.

10:30.087 --> 10:32.465
But there is
still some internal seepage of blood.

10:33.299 --> 10:34.592
Is he going to live?

10:35.176 --> 10:37.678
To a great extent,
his survival will depend

10:37.762 --> 10:40.097
on the strength of his system
and his own will.

10:40.723 --> 10:42.308
Over the next eight or nine hours,

10:42.391 --> 10:44.226
hopefully he'll stabilize
and we'll know more.

10:47.188 --> 10:48.648
(sighs)

10:48.731 --> 10:51.233
-(respirator hissing)
-(monitor beeping)

10:51.317 --> 10:53.361
(melancholic music playing)

11:07.416 --> 11:10.044
Uh... (clears throat)
Hello, Ms. Davenport.

11:10.836 --> 11:12.129
Lieutenant Buntz.

11:13.381 --> 11:15.549
I don't think you're supposed to be here.

11:16.300 --> 11:17.885
Yeah, I know. I had to tell the doctors

11:17.968 --> 11:20.262
I was from the Medical Examiner's Office.

11:21.097 --> 11:22.723
But I got something I want to say to you,

11:22.807 --> 11:24.934
and I think maybe it's kind of important.

11:25.601 --> 11:30.981
I mean, I know everybody's expressing
their sympathies, and that's all fine.

11:31.065 --> 11:32.525
But I figure at a time like this,

11:32.608 --> 11:34.568
it might be better
to hear something positive.

11:35.653 --> 11:36.612
Something positive.

11:37.488 --> 11:39.949
I'm remembering back
to when I first met the captain.

11:40.032 --> 11:43.744
And, uh, well,
he don't necessarily give the impression

11:43.828 --> 11:46.539
that he could tough it
through an ordeal like this.

11:46.622 --> 11:49.083
You know, being shot
in the chest, looks pretty bad.

11:50.543 --> 11:54.380
(clears throat) Look, maybe I don't know
the man as long as everybody else,

11:54.463 --> 11:58.175
but... I know what's inside the guy.

11:58.259 --> 11:59.677
And this ain't gonna stop him.

12:00.803 --> 12:03.347
Now, I'm not just giving you
an opinion here, Ms. Davenport.

12:03.431 --> 12:05.349
This is something I know.

12:05.433 --> 12:09.145
It's like, uh... it's like a sixth sense.
I've always had it.

12:09.228 --> 12:11.480
And, uh, he's gonna be okay.

12:12.356 --> 12:13.649
-You're sure?
-Oh, yeah.

12:14.608 --> 12:16.318
I wouldn't have bothered you like this

12:16.402 --> 12:18.195
if I wasn't absolutely certain.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.239
And also, I feel, uh,

12:20.698 --> 12:23.659
I feel the more people that have
my kind of positive attitude,

12:23.743 --> 12:25.703
well, I think it helps the captain.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.914
-Helps me.
-Good.

12:29.457 --> 12:30.416
(clears throat)

12:32.460 --> 12:34.170
(emotional music playing)

12:39.592 --> 12:40.634
(clears throat)

12:41.427 --> 12:44.722
Look, I'm sure you got a lot of people
you'd call first, but

12:45.639 --> 12:47.975
if there's ever anything
I can do, you know...

12:51.103 --> 12:52.021
Thank you.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.205

13:15.920 --> 13:18.506
MARSHA: <i>Has your extradition in any way</i>

<i>adversely affected your plans?</i>

13:23.093 --> 13:25.304

13:27.723 --> 13:29.600

MARSHA: <i>Do you hope</i>

(voice echoing) <i>Take yourself back</i>

13:53.082 --> 13:54.875
<i>It's deliberate persecution.</i>

13:54.959 --> 13:57.545
Who has deliberately persecuted you?

13:57.628 --> 14:00.130
Cops. Cops trying to make their careers

14:00.214 --> 14:02.174
persecuting an innocent man.

14:02.258 --> 14:04.218
That's all this case is about.

14:04.301 --> 14:05.719
I'll tell you another thing.

14:05.803 --> 14:08.472
An honest judge would throw
the whole thing in the street.

14:18.148 --> 14:20.276
(indistinct conversations)

14:29.869 --> 14:31.871
(monitor beeping)

14:36.458 --> 14:37.751
WOMAN: Mrs. Furillo?

14:39.503 --> 14:41.463
These are
Mr. Furillo's personal belongings.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.215
They were removed before surgery.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.051
Thank you. Do you know
if there's been any improvement?

14:46.135 --> 14:47.303
I really can't say.

14:47.386 --> 14:49.179
You'll have to speak to Dr. Mendelsohn.

14:59.523 --> 15:01.483
FRANK: <i>Notes on first day of testimony</i>

15:01.567 --> 15:03.986
<i>in trial of Biomonte and LeClerc.</i>

15:04.778 --> 15:09.158
(echoing) <i>Exhibits 25 to 41</i>
<i>are transcribed recordings</i>

15:09.241 --> 15:12.119
<i>of conversations</i>
<i>between undercover Detectives</i>

15:12.202 --> 15:14.997
<i>Davillo and Carelli and Jason LeClerc.</i>

15:16.081 --> 15:20.961
Lieutenant Furillo, is it not correct
that you supervise all undercover work

15:21.045 --> 15:23.339
done by Detectives Carelli and Davillo?

15:23.422 --> 15:25.132
-Yes.
-And you are certainly aware

15:25.215 --> 15:27.176
that Detectives Carelli and Davillo

15:27.259 --> 15:29.803
approached Mr. LeClerc
with a large amount of money.

15:29.887 --> 15:31.847
-Ten thousand dollars?
-Yes, I am.

15:31.931 --> 15:36.602
What was the purpose of approaching
Mr. LeClerc with $10,000?

15:36.685 --> 15:39.271
We had reason
to believe that Jason LeClerc

15:39.355 --> 15:43.150
could arrange
a narcotics purchase from Al Biomonte.

15:43.233 --> 15:44.526
JOYCE: Ten thousand dollars?

15:45.611 --> 15:49.239
Is that the usual amount
for street dealers' purchase of drugs?

15:49.323 --> 15:50.407
There is no usual amount.

15:50.491 --> 15:51.951
Why offer such a large amount?

15:52.034 --> 15:54.787
We wanted Mr. LeClerc
to take our offer seriously.

15:54.870 --> 15:57.706
Isn't that another way of saying
you wanted to entice him?

15:57.790 --> 16:00.918
Mr. LeClerc has a long history
of transactions--

16:01.001 --> 16:02.962
-That's not what I asked.
-...anti-narcotics...

16:03.045 --> 16:04.129
Let me finish, I'll answer

16:04.213 --> 16:06.173
-your question.
-Mr. LeClerc's past offenses

16:06.256 --> 16:08.217
are not an issue in this trial

16:08.300 --> 16:09.802
and were not part of my question.

16:09.885 --> 16:12.179
You asked why we offered $10,000.

16:12.262 --> 16:16.225
I'm just trying to say
that Mr. LeClerc's past offenses

16:16.308 --> 16:19.019
qualified him in our minds
as a man experienced

16:19.103 --> 16:20.813
in the large-scale purchase of drugs.

16:20.896 --> 16:24.900
And so to that end,
Mr. LeClerc was offered a chance,

16:25.401 --> 16:27.987
enticed with $10,000 to commit a crime

16:28.070 --> 16:30.531
-for which he is now standing trial.
-That's not true.

16:30.614 --> 16:32.366
Oh, no? Which part of it isn't true?

16:32.866 --> 16:34.451
We did not entice him.

16:34.535 --> 16:35.995
Let me ask you this.

16:37.788 --> 16:43.502
If your detectives
had not given Mr. LeClerc $10,000,

16:44.253 --> 16:45.671
would the purchase of the drugs

16:45.754 --> 16:48.382
for which he is now
being tried have been made?

16:48.465 --> 16:50.926
PROSECUTOR: I object.
The question calls for speculation

16:51.010 --> 16:53.137
-on the part of the witness.
-JUDGE: Sustained.

16:55.431 --> 16:58.100
The defense has
no further questions, Your Honor.

17:00.978 --> 17:04.189
MAN: You made it!
I had almost given you up.

17:04.273 --> 17:06.442
Sorry, Evan. I had a long day.

17:06.525 --> 17:09.528
I was getting so bored
talking to would-be politicians

17:09.611 --> 17:12.281
and would-be kingmakers,
I almost decided to run for something

17:12.364 --> 17:14.241
just to relieve my ennui.

17:14.324 --> 17:17.786
-(romantic music playing)
-(indistinct chatter)

17:17.870 --> 17:19.830
How did they get in without a warrant?

17:19.913 --> 17:21.331
Oh, come on, Joyce.

17:21.415 --> 17:23.876
Can't have a bear-baiting
without the bears.

17:23.959 --> 17:25.878
I wonder who picks Furillo's ties.

17:26.336 --> 17:29.882
-Oh, you're cruel, Evan.
-Just observant.

17:30.924 --> 17:33.177
Excuse me. Hi, how are you?

17:33.260 --> 17:34.595
What about the victims?

17:34.678 --> 17:36.972
Do you think that Miranda
serves them with justice?

17:37.056 --> 17:39.600
Open your ears to the public.
They're outraged!

17:39.683 --> 17:41.518
Why can't you gentlemen come clean?

17:41.602 --> 17:43.562
It's got nothing to do with the victims.

17:43.645 --> 17:46.440
Your beef is with a law
that makes it hard to bully

17:46.523 --> 17:49.193
and intimidate innocent people
into self-incrimination.

17:49.276 --> 17:51.487
You're wrong. In fact,
I think the Miranda decision

17:51.570 --> 17:52.946
has improved police procedure.

17:53.030 --> 17:55.449
-(grunts)
-There's a problem with public perception

17:55.532 --> 17:59.620
when convicted criminals
are routinely released on technicalities.

17:59.703 --> 18:02.915
Uh-uh, you're talking about maybe
two or three percent of all the cases.

18:02.998 --> 18:06.835
But those are the cases that are
publicized, and then there's a backlash.

18:06.919 --> 18:09.296
The public demands
a harder line in law enforcement.

18:09.379 --> 18:12.007
-And you wouldn't want that?
-No, I wouldn't.

18:14.968 --> 18:16.136
I need a drink.

18:17.888 --> 18:19.181
We killed him.

18:25.270 --> 18:26.688
(clears throat)

18:26.772 --> 18:28.190
Hello, Counselor.

18:28.816 --> 18:30.067
Hello, Lieutenant.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.821
Champagne to wash down the canapé?

18:33.904 --> 18:36.323
-Mm. No, I don't drink.
-Never?

18:37.574 --> 18:40.494
You may not have noticed,
but this is a cocktail party.

18:40.577 --> 18:44.289
So what brings you here?
Are you seeking office?

18:44.790 --> 18:47.668
Or are you simply a friend
of man who is seeking office?

18:48.252 --> 18:51.463
I came because the inspector invited me
and because I was curious.

18:52.297 --> 18:54.800
-Is it all you expected?
-And more.

18:55.884 --> 18:57.845
-What's the more?
-You.

18:59.555 --> 19:00.389
Joyce!

19:06.395 --> 19:07.855
I have to mingle.

19:12.734 --> 19:14.736
(monitor beeping)

19:20.742 --> 19:22.494
I have an alarm clock.

19:22.578 --> 19:24.580
Uh-huh, but you never use it.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.707
Probably doesn't work.

19:27.541 --> 19:30.169
We'll open the blinds
and awaken with the dawn.

19:30.252 --> 19:32.296
It's spring! Birds will sing.

19:32.379 --> 19:34.131
Not on the 11th floor.

19:37.426 --> 19:38.343
Uh, excuse me.

19:39.636 --> 19:40.929
-Evan.
-What?

19:47.186 --> 19:49.938
It's Mr. Tact. Do you have some problem?

19:50.022 --> 19:51.607
Well, excuse me for interrupting,

19:51.690 --> 19:53.650
but my car's blocked in.

19:55.986 --> 19:58.113
-(whispers) Good night.
-(whispers) Good night.

20:03.911 --> 20:05.162
(car door closes)

20:08.332 --> 20:09.416
(engine starts)

20:13.712 --> 20:15.255
(tires screech)

20:18.008 --> 20:20.177
(engine revs)

20:21.053 --> 20:22.179
(tires screech)

20:23.305 --> 20:24.181
(tires screech)

20:35.776 --> 20:37.194
-(tires screech)
-(crash)

20:42.241 --> 20:43.492
(car door slams)

20:44.076 --> 20:46.245
-Are you okay?
-I think so. You?

20:49.206 --> 20:50.499
I don't believe this.

20:51.959 --> 20:53.502
You were going the wrong way.

20:54.169 --> 20:56.964
I had no choice.
They closed the damn gate.

20:57.714 --> 20:59.007
Why didn't you honk your horn?

21:01.301 --> 21:03.011
I don't think I can drive it.

21:05.514 --> 21:10.394
Look, I'm totally insu-- (cards clatter)
insured.

21:11.603 --> 21:14.439
Let me give you my agent's number.

21:14.523 --> 21:16.358
(clears throat)

21:22.614 --> 21:25.534
Uh, I'm really sorry about this.

21:26.076 --> 21:27.494
Well, accidents happen.

21:27.995 --> 21:30.163
Thank you. Thank you.

21:44.386 --> 21:45.429
(car door closes)

21:45.971 --> 21:47.681
(engine turns over)

21:47.764 --> 21:49.933
(rattling)

21:55.272 --> 21:57.482
(Joyce starts car)

22:02.738 --> 22:03.822
How are you getting home?

22:04.948 --> 22:09.036
Uh, well, I guess I'll grab a cab.

22:09.536 --> 22:10.787
(car door closes)

22:11.538 --> 22:13.957
It's pouring rain,
and it's the middle of the night.

22:14.624 --> 22:16.209
Shouldn't have any problem at all.

22:18.545 --> 22:20.505
-Where do you live?
-Boyleston Heights.

22:20.589 --> 22:21.840
Way out there?

22:23.050 --> 22:26.303
Well, I can probably find a cab
over at the Cumberland Hotel.

22:29.890 --> 22:31.475
Get in. I'll take you over.

22:33.852 --> 22:36.521
(classical music plays)

22:39.274 --> 22:40.609
Change it if you want.

22:40.692 --> 22:42.527
I listen to WNK.

22:43.528 --> 22:45.947
-Really?
-Any reason why I shouldn't?

22:46.948 --> 22:48.742
No, I was surprised. That's all.

22:49.701 --> 22:52.829
-Do you play an instrument?
-No. Do you?

22:52.913 --> 22:54.373
I wish, but no.

22:54.456 --> 22:55.749
You go to concerts?

22:56.375 --> 22:58.919
Not as much as I'd like to. Do you?

23:00.295 --> 23:01.505
Not for a while.

23:02.547 --> 23:03.882
Five years.

23:04.841 --> 23:06.468
I'd like to start going again.

23:09.596 --> 23:12.182
-I lied.
-Lied about what?

23:12.682 --> 23:14.559
I played violin. Badly.

23:14.643 --> 23:16.228
(chuckles)

23:16.311 --> 23:17.813
I won't tell.

23:18.897 --> 23:20.774
I sort of lied, too.

23:21.483 --> 23:22.984
You took ballet.

23:23.068 --> 23:24.736
That's right. How'd you know?

23:24.820 --> 23:27.447
Dancer's attitude, shows.

23:27.531 --> 23:29.491
Because I walk with my toes in.

23:29.574 --> 23:31.284
That and posture.

23:31.368 --> 23:33.829
Mm. I quit at age 12.

23:33.912 --> 23:35.622
Some things mark you for life.

23:36.081 --> 23:40.335
Yes, fortunately and unfortunately,
some things do.

23:42.170 --> 23:45.006
-(monitor beeping)
-(music continues faintly)

23:53.056 --> 23:55.684
(sighs) No cabs.

23:56.476 --> 23:57.978
Well, I can wait inside.

23:58.520 --> 24:00.063
Suppose a cab doesn't come.

24:01.356 --> 24:02.732
My tough luck.

24:04.860 --> 24:05.944
It's been enjoyable.

24:07.737 --> 24:08.989
Joyce.

24:11.074 --> 24:14.202
I really feel bad just dumping you here.

24:14.703 --> 24:17.164
Well, you can come in and have
a cup of coffee while I wait.

24:17.664 --> 24:19.916
Under the circumstances,
it's the best I can offer.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.626
(siren wailing)

24:21.710 --> 24:24.171
Look, I-I don't live far from here.

24:24.254 --> 24:29.050
I suppose we could go to my apartment.
I can make coffee. You can call a cab.

24:30.969 --> 24:32.053
Great.

24:33.305 --> 24:35.432
-Oh, wait.
-What?

24:35.891 --> 24:37.058
A cab just pulled up.

24:37.976 --> 24:39.227
Oh, I didn't see.

24:39.811 --> 24:41.688
Well, it's right there.

24:43.023 --> 24:44.024
Too bad.

24:46.485 --> 24:47.819
I guess it's good night.

24:49.696 --> 24:51.031
Thanks for the ride.

24:53.074 --> 24:54.367
See you in court.

24:57.829 --> 24:58.663
(car door closes)

24:59.831 --> 25:01.875
MAN: Okay, Mr...

25:01.958 --> 25:04.336
All right, your blood type
matches Captain Furillo's,

25:04.419 --> 25:06.421
so you will qualify as a direct donor.

25:06.505 --> 25:08.381
Good. Take all you need.

25:08.465 --> 25:10.717
-Flex your hand.
-You sure I can't donate?

25:10.800 --> 25:12.052
Not if you've had hepatitis.

25:12.135 --> 25:13.470
Lady, that was eight years ago.

25:13.553 --> 25:15.764
I'm sorry. Just keep flexing your hand.

25:17.057 --> 25:19.059
Tommy Valucci used to work for Biomonte.

25:19.142 --> 25:22.020
-That was years ago, man.
-Yeah, but he might know something.

25:22.103 --> 25:23.438
I'll get you some orange juice.

25:23.522 --> 25:25.190
-Are you all right?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

25:25.774 --> 25:27.192
Is there any word?

25:27.275 --> 25:29.110
Last I heard, condition's unchanged.

25:29.194 --> 25:32.322
-Still listed as grave.
-Which is worse, grave or critical?

25:32.405 --> 25:34.866
Nurse says grave's as bad as it gets.

25:34.950 --> 25:35.992
Oh.

25:36.076 --> 25:38.078
Stay here and rest
for at least 20 minutes.

25:38.161 --> 25:40.080
If you feel sick or faint, call me.

25:44.501 --> 25:47.170
Um, excuse me. My name is Laslo.

25:47.254 --> 25:50.173
I called about donating blood
for Captain Furillo.

25:50.257 --> 25:53.468
You'll have to be typed to see
if you qualify as a direct donor.

25:53.552 --> 25:56.304
If not, you can still donate
blood in Captain Furillo's name.

25:56.388 --> 25:58.265
Fill out this form.
I'll be right with you.

25:58.348 --> 25:59.349
Thank you.

26:01.810 --> 26:04.312
You a friend of Captain Furillo's?

26:04.980 --> 26:06.815
Oh, no, just a concerned cop.

26:06.898 --> 26:08.775
Andrew Renko, Hill Street Station.

26:08.858 --> 26:11.861
I just want to tell you I appreciate
what you're doing very much.

26:12.862 --> 26:15.907
Well, there isn't a cop in town
that isn't pulling for him.

26:21.246 --> 26:24.624
-(monitor beeping)
-(alarm buzzes)

26:24.708 --> 26:26.209
NURSE: That's Furillo. Get a doctor, stat.

26:26.293 --> 26:28.378
DOCTOR: Disconnect the monitor
and get back in here.

26:28.461 --> 26:29.462
Call Dr. Mendelsohn.

26:29.546 --> 26:32.048
Get blood to Surgery A
to transfuse when we get there.

26:32.132 --> 26:33.466
-What happened?
-He's hemorrhaging.

26:33.550 --> 26:34.718
(overlapping chatter)

26:34.801 --> 26:35.885
MAN: Let's go. Move.

26:35.969 --> 26:37.429
(monitor beeping faster)

26:37.512 --> 26:39.097
MAN: OR three is open!

26:39.180 --> 26:42.100
(indistinct chatter)

26:43.310 --> 26:45.604
Blood pressure is 70 over, take your pick.

26:45.687 --> 26:47.355
SURGEON: Put him up, I'll get scrubbed.

26:49.107 --> 26:51.276
MAN: Who's the anesthesiologist on call?

26:58.199 --> 27:00.201
(light working noise)

27:10.962 --> 27:12.922
WOMAN: <i>Union Memorial Hospital.</i>

27:13.006 --> 27:16.134
Hello, yes.
I want to find out about a patient.

27:16.593 --> 27:18.845
Police Captain Francis Furillo.

27:18.928 --> 27:21.848
<i>I'll transfer you to intensive care.</i>

27:22.682 --> 27:25.060
-Hey!
-Not on my time, little man.

27:25.143 --> 27:27.562
Oh, you don't understand.
I got a sick relative.

27:27.646 --> 27:31.191
Yeah, and I got ten sides of beef waiting
for a piggyback ride to the freezer.

27:31.274 --> 27:32.942
-Now move it.
-No. Hey,

27:33.026 --> 27:35.445
I'm guaranteed two 15-minute breaks.

27:35.528 --> 27:37.530
And you ain't heard no buzzer.

27:37.614 --> 27:40.950
Now when you hear the buzzer,
that's when you make your call.

27:41.034 --> 27:44.913
Otherwise, you haul meat. Move!

27:47.248 --> 27:49.334
MAN: Chickens here
before they're defrosted.

27:49.417 --> 27:50.460
Let's go!

27:52.337 --> 27:53.296
Hey!

27:54.214 --> 27:55.048
Hey!

27:56.049 --> 27:57.217
Not that.

27:57.300 --> 27:59.177
Stuff you unload is in the other truck.

28:03.431 --> 28:06.142
Clearly, there's an emotional issue here.
I understand that.

28:06.226 --> 28:07.769
I'm not saying I should head
the investigation.

28:07.852 --> 28:09.479
But people on the Hill should be involved.

28:09.562 --> 28:11.398
-We all want to be involved.
-(exhales)

28:11.481 --> 28:15.151
Don't you know what I feel, seeing Frank
shot down as I stood beside him?

28:15.235 --> 28:18.613
But this investigation,
with all its inherent complexities,

28:18.697 --> 28:21.032
requires a certain level of expertise.

28:21.574 --> 28:23.910
What I'm gently trying to tell you

28:23.993 --> 28:26.037
is that this is out of your league.

28:26.830 --> 28:29.874
Gene. Chief. Henry.

28:30.458 --> 28:31.835
I heard he's back in surgery.

28:31.918 --> 28:33.128
It doesn't look good.

28:33.837 --> 28:35.839
SID went over Furillo's clothes

28:35.922 --> 28:37.549
to determine the angle of entry.

28:38.216 --> 28:40.385
Judging
from where he was standing on the steps,

28:40.468 --> 28:43.263
they figure the gun was fired
from no more than ten feet away.

28:44.013 --> 28:45.598
The guy must have been in the crowd.

28:47.642 --> 28:49.227
Told you I heard the shot.

28:58.695 --> 29:01.322
-I'm afraid to ask.
-He's back in surgery.

29:01.865 --> 29:04.826
An artery was so bad
the stitches wouldn't hold.

29:04.909 --> 29:07.662
They're going to replace it
with a vein graft from his leg.

29:08.163 --> 29:09.789
Does that mean he's gonna be all right?

29:11.374 --> 29:12.542
I just don't know, Fay.

29:13.918 --> 29:15.295
Have you told his parents?

29:16.421 --> 29:18.339
I spoke with his brother this morning,

29:18.423 --> 29:20.425
and he said he'd tell the others.

29:21.301 --> 29:22.761
I suppose I should call him back,

29:22.844 --> 29:24.888
but I was hoping
I'd have something to tell him.

29:24.971 --> 29:26.264
(sobs)

29:26.973 --> 29:29.934
I wish I could wait with you,
but I got Frank, Jr.

29:30.643 --> 29:33.313
He's with my mother.
He's waiting for me to come tell him.

29:33.396 --> 29:35.732
(sniffles) He loves his dad.

29:36.399 --> 29:37.817
He's gonna be so scared!

29:39.110 --> 29:40.236
(voice breaking) I know.

29:49.078 --> 29:51.080
FAY: Would you tell my husband
I'm here, please?

29:51.164 --> 29:53.625
-MAN: And you're here to see?
-JOYCE: Lieutenant Furillo.

29:53.708 --> 29:54.876
FRANK: Hello, Fay.

29:55.752 --> 29:57.128
Oh, hi.

29:57.212 --> 29:59.464
Here, Frank. Catch!

30:02.592 --> 30:03.676
What is this?

30:03.760 --> 30:06.387
It's your child support and alimony check.

30:06.471 --> 30:08.223
It bounced pretty good at the bank.

30:08.306 --> 30:10.475
-Listen, Fay, uh--
-No, you listen.

30:10.558 --> 30:12.936
I've heard every lie, every excuse.

30:13.019 --> 30:15.688
-I'm having a problem with my bank.
-You're having problems?

30:15.772 --> 30:18.942
I'm having problems, Frank!
All my checks are coming back.

30:19.025 --> 30:23.446
Now, how do you think I'm gonna feed
and support and clothe your son?

30:23.530 --> 30:25.240
But maybe you think because you left,

30:25.323 --> 30:26.699
it's not your problem anymore.

30:26.783 --> 30:28.827
Listen, could we talk
about this in my office?

30:28.910 --> 30:30.578
I'll be just a minute.

30:30.662 --> 30:33.623
Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?
Behind closed doors.

30:33.706 --> 30:35.708
-Who is that?
-She's an attorney.

30:35.792 --> 30:38.086
-She's your attorney?
-Not my attorney.

30:38.169 --> 30:39.629
Could we talk in my office?

30:39.712 --> 30:42.674
No. My attorney says
I shouldn't discuss it.

30:43.216 --> 30:46.135
But if you don't have
a cashier's check or cash

30:46.219 --> 30:48.137
in that amount to me by midnight tonight,

30:48.221 --> 30:50.431
we will be discussing it in court!

30:51.015 --> 30:53.685
(telephone ringing)

30:59.399 --> 31:00.859
-Hi.
-Obviously, I didn't pick

31:00.942 --> 31:02.652
a convenient time.

31:02.735 --> 31:05.989
But everywhere I've gone this morning,
I've gotten messages to contact you.

31:06.072 --> 31:07.866
I even got one down in holding.

31:07.949 --> 31:10.368
Tried to reach you by phone,
but you never return my calls.

31:11.327 --> 31:13.079
Has this got something
to do with the case?

31:13.162 --> 31:15.123
No, no, actually, it doesn't.

31:15.206 --> 31:17.208
Actually, it's about money.

31:18.877 --> 31:19.794
What money?

31:19.878 --> 31:21.588
Well, the car. I had it fixed.

31:21.671 --> 31:24.883
But the insurance company
won't issue a check for 60 days.

31:24.966 --> 31:26.467
I'm sorry to ask, but...

31:27.218 --> 31:29.304
I could really use
the 150 bucks I've put out.

31:29.387 --> 31:32.515
No, I'm sorry.
Of course I'll write you a check.

31:32.599 --> 31:33.725
(sighs)

31:34.601 --> 31:36.269
You know, I'd really like to ask you out,

31:36.352 --> 31:38.938
but I just can't afford it right now.

31:40.398 --> 31:41.774
That's certainly being honest.

31:41.858 --> 31:43.818
(chuckles) Not a matter of choice.

31:43.902 --> 31:44.903
The honesty?

31:44.986 --> 31:48.031
(laughing) No. My financial situation.

31:49.407 --> 31:51.409
-(tears check)
-Yes, I saw the demonstration.

31:51.492 --> 31:52.911
Thank you.

31:53.995 --> 31:56.039
Smart money around the PD's office

31:56.122 --> 31:59.500
says Biomonte's looking
at conviction on all counts,

31:59.584 --> 32:01.419
mainly due to your testimony.

32:01.502 --> 32:02.503
Let's hope.

32:03.630 --> 32:05.965
The DA's hinted if Biomonte's convicted,

32:07.133 --> 32:09.010
might drop charges against my client.

32:09.093 --> 32:10.094
Seems fair.

32:12.138 --> 32:15.224
Got a feeling
you might have talked with him.

32:15.308 --> 32:17.894
Oh, I doubt anything I said
would have changed his mind.

32:17.977 --> 32:19.604
I don't have that kind of clout.

32:20.355 --> 32:22.857
You might have more clout
than you're aware of.

32:24.025 --> 32:30.031
Um, on Sundays,
the museum has chamber concerts.

32:30.907 --> 32:32.075
They're free.

32:32.158 --> 32:34.160
(both laugh)

32:34.243 --> 32:35.954
This week it's Mozart quintets.

32:38.623 --> 32:40.041
I'll keep that in mind.

32:45.880 --> 32:47.966
(indistinct chatter)

32:53.221 --> 32:55.098
-Hey!
-Don't! I'm on my break.

32:55.181 --> 32:56.307
I'm trying to help you.

32:57.350 --> 33:00.019
I got degenerates in my own family,
and I know the problem.

33:00.603 --> 33:01.437
What?

33:01.521 --> 33:03.982
You're gonna deny
that you're a degenerate gambler?

33:04.065 --> 33:07.193
Every time I look at you,
you're trying to make a phone call.

33:07.276 --> 33:09.946
You're gonna tell me
you're not trying to contact a book?

33:10.029 --> 33:12.657
I told you I got a sick relative.

33:12.740 --> 33:14.409
(laughs) Running in what race?

33:14.492 --> 33:15.368
Listen, maggot mouth!

33:15.451 --> 33:17.286
-I'm making a phone call.
-(buzzer sounds)

33:17.370 --> 33:19.956
End of break. Now, get back to the meat.

33:24.085 --> 33:25.753
You enjoy this.

33:25.837 --> 33:26.796
What?

33:27.630 --> 33:29.424
I enjoy my work, too.

33:30.675 --> 33:31.634
Hey!

33:37.557 --> 33:39.475
FRANK: So you'll come again next week?

33:39.559 --> 33:40.977
No guarantees.

33:41.686 --> 33:42.937
You like pizza?

33:43.021 --> 33:44.313
Is that an invitation?

33:44.397 --> 33:46.024
Only if you like it.

33:46.566 --> 33:47.567
And if I like pizza,

33:47.650 --> 33:50.278
I'm not so sure I want to tell you I do.

33:50.361 --> 33:51.320
Why?

33:52.572 --> 33:54.240
Frank, it's too complicated.

33:54.991 --> 33:58.327
I'm making my own way now,
and I want to keep it that way.

33:58.411 --> 34:00.371
Anything else is just too complicated.

34:00.455 --> 34:01.748
I'm sorry.

34:01.831 --> 34:03.875
I was only offering pizza.

34:03.958 --> 34:05.126
That's not true.

34:06.919 --> 34:09.380
You know and I know that's not true.

34:12.508 --> 34:14.260
I don't think your reasons are valid.

34:14.719 --> 34:16.345
You still going out with, uh?

34:16.429 --> 34:17.930
Evan. Yes.

34:18.014 --> 34:20.475
Why? Why him and not me?

34:20.558 --> 34:21.768
He's safe.

34:22.602 --> 34:23.853
With you, I'm not so sure.

34:25.688 --> 34:27.648
Frank, I have to go.

34:32.070 --> 34:33.196
See you in court.

34:33.905 --> 34:34.781
(car door closes)

34:34.864 --> 34:36.866
(indistinct chatter)

34:43.414 --> 34:47.251
Mr. Tigrette, have you any explanation
for the fact that Mr. Biomonte

34:47.335 --> 34:49.670
has failed to return
from the lunch recess?

34:50.421 --> 34:52.715
Your honor, I can only
imagine Mr. Biomonte

34:52.799 --> 34:55.259
is lingering over his bisque of tortoni.

34:55.343 --> 34:57.095
I'm certain he'll be here any second.

34:57.178 --> 34:59.388
JUDGE: We have been waiting
for half an hour.

35:00.890 --> 35:04.102
Your Honor, Police Inspector Daniels
has just received information

35:04.185 --> 35:07.980
that Al Biomonte boarded
a plane at Hallister Airport

35:08.064 --> 35:10.274
and is currently en route to Rome.

35:10.358 --> 35:12.777
The state asks
that a bench warrant be issued,

35:12.860 --> 35:16.155
and if the facts support it,
we plan to take immediate action

35:16.239 --> 35:18.491
to have Biomonte extradited.

35:18.574 --> 35:21.410
-What does that mean for me?
-I'm not sure yet.

35:22.495 --> 35:25.790
I see it as a crypto-fascist
manipulation to redirect

35:25.873 --> 35:28.000
the focus of this case toward my client

35:28.084 --> 35:30.169
-to save your image.
-You're absurd.

35:30.253 --> 35:33.047
And didn't you once suggest
there could be a reduction of charges?

35:33.131 --> 35:35.842
-I only said we were considering it.
-What happened to the consideration?

35:35.925 --> 35:37.677
There are certain other priorities.

35:37.760 --> 35:40.471
Of course there are.
You need a body to step over

35:40.555 --> 35:42.515
on your way to appointment
as Chief of Police,

35:42.598 --> 35:45.309
and Mr. LeClerc appears
to be the ideal corpus.

35:46.310 --> 35:47.478
Thank you, gentlemen.

35:52.275 --> 35:54.569
Frank never said a word at that meeting.

35:55.820 --> 35:58.406
Crypto-fascist manipulations.

35:59.866 --> 36:01.534
That's the way it seemed at the time.

36:01.617 --> 36:03.744
You were wrong.
There wasn't any conspiracy.

36:04.537 --> 36:06.873
But remember,
Biomonte had just skipped the country.

36:06.956 --> 36:08.916
Reducing the charge
against his co-defendant

36:09.000 --> 36:11.836
did not seem to be in the best interest
of good public relations.

36:12.461 --> 36:15.298
Maybe I'm the one
that should have suspected a conspiracy.

36:17.133 --> 36:18.342
Why is that?

36:19.302 --> 36:22.513
After you left, Frank started
to argue against our position.

36:23.347 --> 36:26.559
It's not like it was the first time
he took a stand opposite to my own.

36:28.102 --> 36:30.313
But all of a sudden, he was very strong.

36:31.022 --> 36:33.065
He said on the basis
of fairness to LeClerc,

36:33.149 --> 36:34.442
we should plead him down.

36:34.525 --> 36:37.028
It wasn't a conspiracy.

36:37.612 --> 36:39.155
He didn't do it for me.

36:40.281 --> 36:42.533
Maybe not for you, but because of you.

36:43.201 --> 36:46.495
It was the first time I saw
Frank really starting to emerge.

36:47.830 --> 36:49.290
I think you had a lot to do with that.

36:51.584 --> 36:54.003
Well, the plea didn't hurt your PR.

36:54.086 --> 36:55.171
You got appointed.

36:55.254 --> 36:58.174
And the first thing I did
was promote Frank to captain.

37:00.218 --> 37:02.762
I knew what he had in him
was very special.

37:03.429 --> 37:05.097
I saw it right from the beginning.

37:06.807 --> 37:08.309
In spite of our differences...

37:09.894 --> 37:11.854
the tension caused by recent events...

37:13.856 --> 37:15.024
I still see it,

37:15.733 --> 37:16.901
even though I don't want to.

37:23.741 --> 37:25.993
We've been getting a lot of crank calls.

37:26.077 --> 37:28.287
I've been sorting them out,
but there's this one guy.

37:28.371 --> 37:30.706
He says he was at the scene
and has something to sell.

37:30.790 --> 37:33.876
-Something to sell?
-Yeah, name's Sowers. Mr. Sowers?

37:33.960 --> 37:36.420
Uh, Mr. Sowers, this is Lieutenant Buntz.

37:36.504 --> 37:38.130
You were at the courthouse.

37:38.214 --> 37:41.550
(foreign accent) Terrible. I saw it all
right through viewfinder of my camera.

37:41.634 --> 37:43.302
I'm professional photographer.

37:43.386 --> 37:46.597
-Really?
-I've sold to every newspaper in city.

37:46.681 --> 37:49.100
-Now maybe I sell to you.
-Sell me what?

37:49.183 --> 37:52.937
(chuckles) Sell you
what I saw and what I have on film.

37:55.189 --> 37:56.440
Let's talk in private.

37:57.566 --> 37:59.610
Grab me away from my dinner table.

37:59.694 --> 38:01.529
No respect for family values.

38:01.612 --> 38:03.406
I got my mother, she's 84 years old,

38:03.489 --> 38:04.949
worried about me. Do they care?

38:05.032 --> 38:07.368
-Hey. Get him out of here!
-You got no heart, Detective.

38:07.451 --> 38:09.370
That's the trouble with you.
You got no heart.

38:09.453 --> 38:11.831
Biomonte used to move
with a guy named Johnny Matta.

38:11.914 --> 38:13.916
-Let's get him--
-I just talked to Division.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.918
They're chasing Biomonte
and have nothing--

38:16.002 --> 38:18.379
I know where I'm going with this.
The shooter's still out there.

38:18.462 --> 38:20.423
-He's loose and laughing at us--
-Listen to me.

38:20.506 --> 38:22.800
-Just getting yourself crazy.
-You don't understand.

38:22.883 --> 38:25.761
I got to do something.
They wouldn't even let me give blood.

38:25.845 --> 38:28.306
We gotta take some kind of action,
not just stand around.

38:28.389 --> 38:31.600
I understand what you feel.
It's what I feel.

38:31.684 --> 38:34.645
It's what we all feel. But whatever we do,
it has to be effective,

38:34.729 --> 38:36.147
or else it don't do nobody no good.

38:36.230 --> 38:38.149
-(indistinct chatter)
-(typing)

38:38.232 --> 38:40.609
I'm professional.
I should get paid for pictures I take.

38:40.693 --> 38:42.361
If it's real, I'll give you 50 bucks.

38:42.445 --> 38:44.155
-Let's see it.
-(laughs) Fifty bucks!

38:44.238 --> 38:46.949
Or I'll subpoena whatever photo you got,
and you get nothing.

38:47.033 --> 38:49.869
I can flush it down the toilet,
and you can subpoena the sewer.

38:49.952 --> 38:52.955
You could also fall down
a flight of stairs or out a window.

38:53.831 --> 38:54.915
You are threatening me?

38:54.999 --> 38:58.044
No, I'm just reading your tea leaves, pal,
and you're accident prone.

38:58.127 --> 39:00.963
Now, I want to see that picture
before you break something.

39:01.047 --> 39:02.798
-Fifty bucks?
-That's what I said.

39:08.429 --> 39:10.348
(telephone ringing)

39:10.431 --> 39:11.640
I know this guy.

39:11.724 --> 39:13.225
-You kidding?
-I've seen him, too.

39:13.309 --> 39:14.560
We're through here. Let's check the books.

39:14.643 --> 39:15.561
Right.

39:17.229 --> 39:18.439
(elevator dings)

39:20.566 --> 39:22.985
-Hello, Mick.
-Hello, Captain, how are you?

39:23.069 --> 39:24.570
-Fine. How are you?
-I'm all right.

39:24.653 --> 39:26.322
-What is the latest news?
-I don't know.

39:26.405 --> 39:28.324
He's been in surgery for hours.

39:28.407 --> 39:29.867
Nobody knows nothing.

39:32.119 --> 39:33.954
I got to go. I'm on an undercover.

39:34.914 --> 39:38.417
I'd like to stay,
but I got to make the pop.

39:38.501 --> 39:40.044
Sure, Mick, sure.

39:47.385 --> 39:49.762
-Officer Laslo.
-Yes?

39:49.845 --> 39:52.431
I'm Captain Calletano,
the Polk Avenue Precinct.

39:52.515 --> 39:55.101
Your name tag is
on the wrong side of your uniform.

39:56.143 --> 39:58.979
Oh, my kids
must have played with it again.

39:59.063 --> 40:01.899
-Sorry about that.
-Next time be more observant.

40:01.982 --> 40:03.150
Yes, I will.

40:03.234 --> 40:04.527
(elevator dings)

40:04.610 --> 40:06.904
(doors open)

40:12.034 --> 40:13.744
(baby cries)

40:17.123 --> 40:18.541
(knocking)

40:22.002 --> 40:23.045
(door kicked open)

40:33.722 --> 40:35.307
-(indistinct radio talk)
-Hey, hey!

40:35.391 --> 40:36.642
DANIELS: <i>That's ridiculous.</i>

40:36.725 --> 40:38.686
<i>The statute doesn't run</i>
<i>when you flee the country...</i>

40:38.769 --> 40:40.396
-HENRY: Over here.
-(clicks off tape)

40:43.774 --> 40:47.236
His name is Randolph Scripps.
He's been arrested three times.

40:47.820 --> 40:51.407
He was released from the Edge Hill
Psychiatric Hospital in June.

40:51.490 --> 40:53.242
Why would he shoot Frank?

40:53.325 --> 40:54.869
His earlier arrest involved

40:54.952 --> 40:57.371
the attempted murder
of a candidate for local office.

40:57.455 --> 40:59.165
I guess he read the morning paper.

40:59.248 --> 41:01.542
There doesn't seem to be
any connection to Biomonte.

41:02.418 --> 41:03.836
Well, we've completed surgery.

41:03.919 --> 41:05.546
Your husband's on his way
back to intensive care.

41:05.629 --> 41:06.755
How is he?

41:06.839 --> 41:08.424
The operation went relatively well,

41:08.507 --> 41:11.886
but until his condition stabilizes,
it's really very hard to know.

41:11.969 --> 41:13.262
I'd like to be with him.

41:13.345 --> 41:15.473
-Could you tell the others?
-Sure.

41:15.556 --> 41:18.309
(monitor beeping)

41:23.564 --> 41:27.151
It's not the greatest,
but you need some nourishment.

41:27.234 --> 41:28.194
Thank you.

41:40.039 --> 41:43.000
Pizza? Just a yen.

41:43.083 --> 41:44.877
It's something you send out for, Davy.

41:44.960 --> 41:47.213
Fortunately,
they don't even have it in restaurants.

41:47.296 --> 41:48.881
They won't have it at Lubeck's.

41:49.924 --> 41:51.175
You're still on for dinner?

41:52.885 --> 41:53.802
Sure.

41:53.886 --> 41:55.012
Good.

41:55.095 --> 41:57.389
-(romantic music playing)
-(indistinct chatter)

42:00.518 --> 42:02.394
Now, let's talk about important things.

42:03.103 --> 42:06.982
The firm represents major gay
organizations, major feminists--

42:07.066 --> 42:09.735
Evan, it's all just recreation.

42:09.818 --> 42:10.861
Even me?

42:11.737 --> 42:13.030
Don't answer that.

42:14.365 --> 42:17.910
But the offer, Joyce,
the position is real.

42:17.993 --> 42:21.163
As a way of advising you, let me tell you
why I've always felt

42:21.247 --> 42:24.083
that Dr. Albert Schweitzer
was a total sellout.

42:24.166 --> 42:27.336
First of all, he only made
a few, very early recordings.

42:27.419 --> 42:30.714
So his great mastery of the organ
was wasted on an audience

42:30.798 --> 42:33.467
that obviously
would have preferred the drums.

42:33.551 --> 42:36.220
Evan, would you excuse me
for a minute, please?

42:36.303 --> 42:37.346
Well, sure.

42:41.642 --> 42:42.768
(clears throat)

42:44.645 --> 42:45.896
-Hello.
-Hi.

42:47.231 --> 42:49.358
I heard LeClerc's case was dismissed

42:49.441 --> 42:51.819
on fourth-amendment grounds.
Congratulations.

42:52.778 --> 42:54.947
I'd say he had a hell of an attorney.

42:58.659 --> 42:59.910
I'll be right back.

43:04.915 --> 43:07.626
Evan, you are one of the few people I know

43:07.710 --> 43:10.504
who can really appreciate
outrageous behavior.

43:11.922 --> 43:14.174
I hope this doesn't mean
what I think it means.

43:14.258 --> 43:15.968
I'd like to beg out of dinner tonight.

43:19.346 --> 43:20.347
Furillo.

43:21.307 --> 43:23.183
I should have known
by the longing for pizza.

43:40.701 --> 43:41.994
I have seen this man.

43:42.077 --> 43:44.663
He's here, in a midtown police uniform.

43:44.747 --> 43:46.957
-Nameplate is--
-He's here?

43:47.499 --> 43:48.334
Yes.

43:48.417 --> 43:51.545
Look, I'll take Furillo's floor.
Tell Goldblume and the others,

43:51.629 --> 43:54.048
check all uniforms.
If this guy gets our scent, he's gone.

43:55.549 --> 43:57.343
(monitor beeping)

44:14.318 --> 44:16.028
So it began with opera.

44:16.111 --> 44:18.280
My mother was afraid
we'd be hit by lightning.

44:18.364 --> 44:21.158
My father and I put
this huge antenna up on the roof

44:21.241 --> 44:23.452
so we could listen
to <i>Saturdays at the Met.</i>

44:25.079 --> 44:26.664
My father would translate.

44:26.747 --> 44:30.542
And then the NBC Symphony,
with Toscanini conducting.

44:32.086 --> 44:34.213
Before my mother and father were married,

44:35.047 --> 44:36.632
my father was in the merchant marine,

44:36.715 --> 44:38.967
and he told us about these amazing places.

44:39.051 --> 44:41.679
So when I was a kid,
the music was like an illustration

44:41.762 --> 44:44.264
of this incredible world he saw.

44:46.475 --> 44:48.102
I've never been anywhere. Have you?

44:48.185 --> 44:49.728
You mean like Europe?

44:49.812 --> 44:51.939
-For a start.
-Yeah, I've been there.

44:52.022 --> 44:53.857
I saw cathedrals, museums.

44:55.025 --> 44:57.277
I don't know, actually.
I feel like I saw nothing.

44:57.361 --> 44:59.905
-And I'd like to go back.
-It's still there.

45:00.572 --> 45:02.366
-Yeah.
-There's still time.

45:11.333 --> 45:13.127
-Would you like some more pizza?
-No.

45:15.003 --> 45:17.047
Let's have coffee at my place.

45:26.890 --> 45:29.226
FRANK: What time do you suppose it is?

45:29.727 --> 45:31.603
I have no idea. Why?

45:33.147 --> 45:36.108
Well, I was just wondering
if we should try to get some sleep.

45:36.191 --> 45:37.067
(chuckles)

45:37.151 --> 45:38.193
Why bother?

45:40.487 --> 45:43.490
It's too late to think about sleep.

45:48.036 --> 45:49.913
So you're still not tired, huh?

45:50.372 --> 45:54.668
Mm. Not tired enough. How about you?

45:58.797 --> 46:01.717
Mm. I've got the distinct feeling

46:02.426 --> 46:04.303
you're not tired enough, either.

46:04.386 --> 46:07.181
(chuckles)

46:09.975 --> 46:16.106
(chatter over PA)

46:16.190 --> 46:17.357
Lieutenant Buntz.

46:17.441 --> 46:18.984
(indistinct chatter)

46:25.365 --> 46:27.201
Hey. Hey, officer!

46:28.285 --> 46:30.454
It's Scripps! Hey, hold it!

46:30.537 --> 46:31.789
Stop that guy!

46:33.999 --> 46:35.959
Look out! Look out! Get out of my way!

46:48.096 --> 46:50.724
(gunshot echoing)

46:55.103 --> 46:56.230
You got him.

46:56.313 --> 46:58.315
Yeah. (chuckles)

46:58.398 --> 47:00.609
Wasn't that one hell of a shot, huh?

47:00.692 --> 47:01.777
(chuckles)

47:01.860 --> 47:04.655
(monitor beeping)

47:13.330 --> 47:15.165
His vital signs seem steady.

47:16.917 --> 47:18.544
It's been such a long day for you,

47:18.627 --> 47:20.337
if you wanted to go home
and get some rest.

47:20.420 --> 47:21.713
I think I'll stay.

47:23.423 --> 47:26.093
There's a bed in the nurses' quarters
if you want to lie down.

47:26.176 --> 47:28.011
Thank you. Maybe later.

47:36.311 --> 47:39.690
(melancholic music playing)

48:01.295 --> 48:03.297
(theme music playing)
