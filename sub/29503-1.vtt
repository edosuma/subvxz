Surely, they are not all amoral?

No, but just because
      they don't believe,

01:46.841 --> 01:49.475
doesn't mean there isn't God
         or the devil.

[door opens]

30:46.879 --> 30:48.011
[door closes]

30:51.984 --> 30:53.250
From the book of Job.

30:54.253 --> 30:56.086
"As long as my breath is in me,

30:56.088 --> 30:58.889
and the Spirit of God
       is in my nostrils,

30:58.891 --> 31:00.991
my lips will not
       speak falsehood."

31:00.993 --> 31:03.627
"And my tongue
    will not utter deceit."

31:03.629 --> 31:05.229
Good verse.

31:05.231 --> 31:06.964
My grandfather loved Job.

31:08.901 --> 31:11.301
He called him the best bet
       God has ever made.

31:11.303 --> 31:13.070
Are you a man of faith?

31:13.072 --> 31:14.137
No.

31:15.074 --> 31:17.658
I'm more of a pragmatist.

31:17.659 --> 31:20.243
Uh-huh. But who hath put wisdom
      in the inward parts?

31:20.246 --> 31:22.379
And given understanding
          to the mind?

31:24.550 --> 31:25.983
Point taken.

31:25.985 --> 31:27.351
How can I help you?

31:31.056 --> 31:33.257
I haven't been here in years.

31:33.259 --> 31:35.092
[Aaron] This was
    my grandfather's church.

31:36.528 --> 31:38.161
[Mike] Welcome back.

31:38.163 --> 31:39.529
What's your grandfather's name?

31:40.232 --> 31:41.431
Pastor Powell.

31:41.433 --> 31:42.599
Lawrence Powell?

31:43.569 --> 31:44.635
You knew him?

31:44.637 --> 31:47.104
I never met the man.

31:47.106 --> 31:49.273
He'd left the church
before I took over this parish.

31:49.275 --> 31:51.508
But he called here last week,
        left a message,

31:51.510 --> 31:53.277
said he was going to drop by,
        but didn't show.

31:54.947 --> 31:56.046
I don't mean to be insensitive,

31:56.048 --> 31:58.649
but, I understand
       he lost the faith.

32:02.221 --> 32:04.588
After my mother died,
  my grandfather decided to...

32:05.557 --> 32:07.424
practice psychiatry full time.

32:07.426 --> 32:09.960
Oh. How is Dr. Powell?

32:12.097 --> 32:13.163
He's dead.

32:14.967 --> 32:16.266
I am so sorry.

32:21.140 --> 32:22.673
[exhales sharply]

32:22.675 --> 32:25.375
Seems like you are searching
         for something.

32:25.377 --> 32:27.377
I just feel like
     I hardly knew the man.

32:28.647 --> 32:30.981
When God takes those we love,

32:32.051 --> 32:35.152
we're often confused and angry.

32:38.657 --> 32:40.657
It's a clarion call to action.

32:42.294 --> 32:44.294
Keep searching.

32:44.296 --> 32:46.530
I believe you'll find
   what you are looking for.

32:48.634 --> 32:50.067
[Mike] Would you like to pray?

32:52.471 --> 32:53.537
No.

32:53.539 --> 32:55.973
Thank you for your time.

32:55.975 --> 32:57.407
-[Mike] Mike.
        -[Aaron] Aaron.

32:57.409 --> 32:59.109
-[Mike] Welcome back any time.
      -[Aaron] All right.

Hey!

33:53.098 --> 33:54.281
Okay, whoa, dude!

33:54.282 --> 33:55.465
This is not
    what it looks like, man.

33:55.467 --> 33:56.566
-Who are you?
         -No, no, man,

33:56.568 --> 33:57.584
this is a misunderstanding,
             okay?

33:57.585 --> 33:58.601
Why you breaking into my house?

33:58.604 --> 34:00.137
[Cleo] Because I asked them to.

34:03.308 --> 34:06.043
I know this looks bad.

34:06.045 --> 34:07.511
We just need answers.

34:09.380 --> 34:11.481
Tell me what's going on.

34:11.483 --> 34:13.083
There's something
        you should see.

<i> This particular stretch</i>

[Cleo] <i> Buckout Road,</i>

34:32.670 --> 34:34.804
<i> This is the site</i>
     <i> of Buckout farmhouse.</i>

34:34.806 --> 34:39.743
<i> Built in 1852, it was the home</i>
   <i> of John and Mary Buckout.</i>

34:39.745 --> 34:41.545
[Cleo] <i> John Buckout</i>
       <i> was a slave owner,</i>

34:41.547 --> 34:44.547

  <i> was driven mad by jealousy,</i>

34:44.550 --> 34:46.382
<i>and beat his pregnant wife Mary</i>

34:46.385 --> 34:49.453

  <i> had an affair with a slave.</i>

34:49.455 --> 34:51.554
<i> According to legend,</i>
        <i> Mary miscarried</i>

<i> and in a desperate act</i>
        <i> of self-defense,</i>

34:53.525 --> 34:56.560
<i> killed John</i>

34:56.562 --> 34:59.329
<i> Mary's ghost is said</i>

35:04.670 --> 35:06.570
<i> and to their doom.</i>

35:06.572 --> 35:08.238

35:08.240 --> 35:10.357

35:10.358 --> 35:12.475
<i> including the one about</i>
 <i> the flesh-eating Albino twins</i>

35:12.478 --> 35:15.445
<i> that lived in this house back</i>
         <i> in the 1970's.</i>

35:15.447 --> 35:17.114
<i> Now, the story goes,</i>

35:17.116 --> 35:18.515
<i> that if you pulled up</i>
          <i> in your car</i>

35:18.517 --> 35:20.717
<i>and honked the horn three times,</i>

35:20.719 --> 35:23.353
<i>the Albino Twins would appear...</i>

35:23.355 --> 35:26.223
[both] <i> And then eat you.</i>

35:26.225 --> 35:28.492
<i> The most notorious</i>
  <i> of the Buckout Road legends</i>

35:28.494 --> 35:30.494
<i> is of the three witches</i>

35:30.495 --> 35:32.495
<i> who were burnt at the stake</i>
            <i> in 1650.</i>

35:32.498 --> 35:35.132
<i> Three X's marked</i>

35:40.239 --> 35:41.905

35:41.907 --> 35:43.807
<i> Cars have been known to crash.</i>

35:44.710 --> 35:46.376

<i>Only one in 20,000 people carry</i>

36:17.543 --> 36:18.608
[keyboard clacks]

36:20.245 --> 36:21.711
It was our class project.

"The Creation and Destruction
        of Modern Myth."

36:24.583 --> 36:28.318
We chose
the Buckout Road urban legends.

36:28.320 --> 36:30.220
About three weeks ago,
    we started having these

36:30.222 --> 36:32.522
really vivid nightmares.

36:32.524 --> 36:34.524
And then,
   the sleepwalking started.

36:34.526 --> 36:35.725
[Erik] Okay, we have a theory.

36:35.727 --> 36:37.460
No, dude, you have a theory.

36:37.462 --> 36:38.762
Dude, you said
      it seemed plausible.

36:38.764 --> 36:40.164
Yeah, we were high,

36:40.165 --> 36:41.565
anything's plausible
       when you're high.

36:41.567 --> 36:44.401
We think we might be cursed.

36:44.403 --> 36:45.735
And we're going to end up
       killing ourselves,

36:45.737 --> 36:47.370
just like Stephanie did.

36:50.342 --> 36:51.875
Get out of my house.

All of you.

Your grandfather recorded
   all of his sessions, okay?

36:56.648 --> 36:58.381
There might be something
    in those videos, right?

Alse Young?

Right?

41:21.179 --> 41:22.579
Who's Alse Young?

41:22.581 --> 41:24.113
It's the Woman of Windsor.

41:24.115 --> 41:25.782
[Erik] First recorded instance
          of a person

41:25.784 --> 41:27.517
being executed for witchcraft.

41:27.519 --> 41:28.785
She was hanged
   in Hartford, Connecticut,

41:28.787 --> 41:30.954
but there's nothing
      about Young's trial

41:30.956 --> 41:32.889
or specifics about
      the hanging itself.

41:34.059 --> 41:36.559
There is no record of this
          in Hartford.

41:36.561 --> 41:39.195
Okay, it says here
that Alse originally lived here

41:39.197 --> 41:42.632
in Westchester with her parents
       and three sisters.

41:42.634 --> 41:44.801
After she was hanged
          in Hartford,

41:44.803 --> 41:47.604
a group of vigilante zealots
 came back here and found them.

41:49.207 --> 41:51.458
In a private tribunal,

41:51.459 --> 41:53.710
Councilor Jonathan Black
    ordered their execution.

41:55.680 --> 41:57.680
All three women burned
         at the stake,

41:57.682 --> 41:59.182
off of Buckout Road.

41:59.184 --> 42:02.018
[Cleo] The entire family of five
          were killed.

42:02.020 --> 42:03.086
Holy shit.

42:04.523 --> 42:06.089
The urban legend is real.

42:06.091 --> 42:08.258
Make that copy
and meet at my place in an hour.

42:09.060 --> 42:10.126
[Erik] Let's go.

42:12.597 --> 42:13.663
[Derek] Dude.

42:18.203 --> 42:21.070
Dr. Powell's final report
     on Stephanie Hancock,

42:21.072 --> 42:23.039
retrieved from the crash site.

42:23.041 --> 42:24.908
Well, I'll take it.

42:25.610 --> 42:26.676
Thank you.

42:30.048 --> 42:32.282
[tense music]

42:41.159 --> 42:43.192
-Cheryl?
      -[Cheryl] Yes, boss?

42:44.062 --> 42:45.828
[drawer clatters]

42:46.898 --> 42:48.264
I'm going for a drive.

42:52.270 --> 42:54.237
What does it say
      about Buckout Road?

42:54.239 --> 42:56.205
There wasn't
   a Buckout Road back then.

42:57.776 --> 42:59.108
But there is this,

43:01.046 --> 43:02.979
"The landeth is anon cursed

43:02.981 --> 43:07.951
and from this day forward shalt
<i>be-est known asdéofol's path."</i>

43:07.953 --> 43:09.319
<i> Déofol?</i>

43:09.321 --> 43:10.920
The devil.

43:10.922 --> 43:12.221
[car door closes]

43:12.223 --> 43:15.325
[Cleo] <i> Buckout Road</i>
      <i> is the Devil's Path.</i>

43:21.766 --> 43:23.099
[Aaron] <i> The dreams,</i>

43:23.101 --> 43:24.801
what do we know?

43:24.803 --> 43:26.169
[Cleo] Each of us
       is having a dream

43:26.171 --> 43:28.338
related to
  a Buckout Road urban legend.

43:29.808 --> 43:32.108
We are all sleepwalking.

43:32.110 --> 43:35.244
-What are we missing?
       -Everything, man.

43:35.246 --> 43:37.313
Why are we having them?
      How do we stop them?

43:37.315 --> 43:38.998
Are we gonna die?

43:38.999 --> 43:40.682
Is this all just
     a stupid coincidence?

43:40.685 --> 43:42.251
Buckout Road.

43:42.253 --> 43:44.787
[Aaron] What do we know now
  that we didn't know before?

43:44.789 --> 43:47.023
We know the legend
    of the witches is real.

43:48.193 --> 43:49.959
They put a curse on the road.

43:49.961 --> 43:51.427
What are we missing?

43:51.428 --> 43:52.894
How any of this could be
    even remotely possible.

43:52.897 --> 43:55.264
Come on, we're never gonna get
answers until we just admit it.

43:55.266 --> 43:56.332
Admit what?

43:56.334 --> 43:58.201
We're being punished
        for our project.

43:59.270 --> 44:01.304
Oh, you think
    we hurt evil's feelings?

44:01.306 --> 44:02.672
Come on!

44:03.775 --> 44:05.041
[Cleo] What's your explanation?

44:05.043 --> 44:07.944
Uh, power of suggestion?
       We're not cursed.

44:07.946 --> 44:09.379
-But what if we are?
          -We're not!

44:09.381 --> 44:12.115
-What if we are?
      -Listen to yourself.

44:12.117 --> 44:14.684
There's no evil. There's no God.

44:14.686 --> 44:16.419
That's why we did this project
      in the first place,

44:16.421 --> 44:18.354
because I'm an atheist
        and so are you.

44:20.892 --> 44:22.125
Not anymore.

44:23.361 --> 44:24.794
[scoffs]

44:24.796 --> 44:26.062
If you're the ones being cursed,

44:26.064 --> 44:27.930
why am I having dreams
      of a pregnant woman

44:27.932 --> 44:29.432
being beaten by slave owners?

44:29.434 --> 44:30.850
[Erik] Wait,

44:30.851 --> 44:32.267
you dream about
     John and Mary Buckout?

44:32.270 --> 44:34.837
And witches,
     and '70s muscle cars,

44:34.839 --> 44:36.272
and messed up suicides!

44:36.274 --> 44:37.707
That's something.

44:37.709 --> 44:40.109
But we're dreaming about
    a specific urban legend,

44:40.111 --> 44:41.911
-right?
         -[Cleo] Yeah.

44:41.912 --> 44:43.712
And you're dreaming
       about all of them.

44:43.715 --> 44:45.982
Maybe it's like a virus.

44:45.983 --> 44:48.250
Yeah, like that dream flu
   that's been going around.

44:48.253 --> 44:49.952
Has the sleepwalking
          started yet?

44:50.388 --> 44:51.454
No.

44:51.456 --> 44:52.822
It will.

44:54.092 --> 44:55.458
-[Harris] Cleo?
         -[door opens]

44:55.460 --> 44:57.260
Oh, I'm sorry,
 I didn't know you had company.

44:58.430 --> 44:59.962
What are you
     two idiots doing here?

44:59.964 --> 45:01.698
[scoffs]
              Dad!

45:04.936 --> 45:07.003
[Harris] I'm sorry,
        what's going on?

45:07.005 --> 45:08.204
Those idiots...

45:08.206 --> 45:09.739
-Yeah?
      -...are my friends!

45:09.741 --> 45:11.107
[Cleo] They're actually
        in my class so,

45:11.109 --> 45:12.709
way to be paying attention, Dad.

45:12.711 --> 45:15.244
Yeah, speaking of,
     where were you today?

45:15.246 --> 45:17.346
How do you know
       I wasn't in class?

45:17.348 --> 45:19.282
Your phone.

45:19.283 --> 45:21.217
-You're geotagging me?
   -I'm concerned about you.

45:21.219 --> 45:23.252
I don't want you hanging out
    with any of those guys,

45:23.254 --> 45:24.420
especially Aaron.

45:24.422 --> 45:26.189
You don't want me hanging out
           with Aaron

45:26.191 --> 45:27.307
because his grandfather died?

45:27.308 --> 45:28.424
[Harris] I think,
    given what's happened--

45:28.426 --> 45:30.059
[Cleo]
  What are you afraid of, Dad?

45:30.061 --> 45:32.045
That I'm going to commiserate?

45:32.046 --> 45:34.030
You should be grateful I have
  someone that's there for me.

45:41.406 --> 45:42.839
I'm sorry, Dad.

45:46.077 --> 45:47.877
Invite your friends to dinner.

46:09.234 --> 46:11.968
-I'm good.
              -Mm.

46:11.970 --> 46:14.437
Next couple weeks I'm just gonna
 be taking care of the estate.

46:14.439 --> 46:16.439
Have you got someone
          to help out?

46:16.441 --> 46:18.407
No, my grandpa took care
         of everything,

46:18.409 --> 46:20.977
so, I just have to sign
      a bunch of paperwork

46:20.979 --> 46:23.946
-and sell the house.
              -Oh.

46:23.948 --> 46:25.665
Are you leaving?

46:25.666 --> 46:27.383
[Aaron] Yeah, I'm going to go
    back to NPS eventually.

46:27.385 --> 46:29.886
Navy Post-graduate School.

46:29.888 --> 46:32.054
Well, tactical training?

46:32.056 --> 46:34.323
Masters, religious studies
        and philosophy.

46:34.893 --> 46:36.058
[scoffs]

46:36.060 --> 46:37.193
Dad.

46:37.195 --> 46:39.078
[chuckles]
             Well,

46:39.079 --> 46:40.962
seems like you're not taking
   advantage of the facility.

46:40.965 --> 46:44.400
Will you, uh, spend your
    military career praying?

46:44.402 --> 46:46.169
Dad!

46:46.171 --> 46:48.204
Not all wars are fought
      on the battlefield.

46:49.207 --> 46:50.907
Most are fought in the mind.

46:50.909 --> 46:53.342
Oh, well, you would know.

46:57.048 --> 46:59.248
Is there something
  you would like to say to me,

46:59.250 --> 47:01.167
Detective Harris?

47:01.168 --> 47:03.085
No. I'm just curious how you're
    dealing with all that's,

47:03.087 --> 47:04.520
you know, all that's happened.

47:04.522 --> 47:06.222
I'm fine.

47:06.224 --> 47:08.424
You got it all handled?
      Do you... No, uh...

47:09.327 --> 47:10.560
No sudden urges?

47:10.562 --> 47:11.894
What are you doing?

47:13.164 --> 47:14.263
He's trying to ask me,

47:14.265 --> 47:16.199
in the least subtle way
           possible,

47:16.200 --> 47:18.134
if I'm going to burn down
    my grandfather's house.

47:18.136 --> 47:20.837
Why would you burn down
   your grandfather's house?

47:20.839 --> 47:22.171
Because I did it before.

47:23.241 --> 47:25.308
[scoffs]
       Dad, is this true?

47:25.310 --> 47:26.976
If he says so.

47:26.978 --> 47:28.544
I mean, by law,
   I wouldn't even be allowed

47:28.546 --> 47:32.915
to comment on
 a sealed juvenile case, so...

47:32.917 --> 47:35.484
You know, if you didn't want me
to hang out with your daughter,

47:35.486 --> 47:37.854
you could have just manned up
    and told me to my face.

47:39.123 --> 47:40.256
Excuse me.

47:41.226 --> 47:42.458
Thank you for dinner.

47:50.201 --> 47:51.334

47:51.336 --> 47:53.269
What the hell was that?

47:53.271 --> 47:56.973
Aaron Powell
   is an unstable young man.

47:56.975 --> 47:59.308
That fire nearly killed someone.

48:00.345 --> 48:02.211
And this is how
    you want me to find out?

48:03.214 --> 48:04.313
Like this?

48:10.955 --> 48:12.154
[door closes]

48:12.156 --> 48:13.623
They're coming back, right?

48:15.293 --> 48:16.359

[Cleo] You shouldn't leave
   your door open, you know.

48:41.920 --> 48:44.020
All kinds of crazies out there.

48:44.022 --> 48:45.154
[Aaron chuckles]

48:49.527 --> 48:50.660
Tell me what happened.

48:57.535 --> 49:00.436
My parents had just died
    in a freak car accident.

49:00.438 --> 49:01.604
I was an angry kid.

49:04.075 --> 49:05.341
One night, I took...

49:06.678 --> 49:08.344
all the family photos
          I could find

49:08.346 --> 49:10.246
and put them in a trashcan
     and set them on fire.

49:12.083 --> 49:13.950
[Aaron] I accidentally...

49:13.952 --> 49:16.018
knocked that can over,

49:16.020 --> 49:17.720
and the fire spread
   to the rest of the house.

49:19.123 --> 49:21.424
My neighbor, Mr. Cooper,
         pulled me out,

49:21.426 --> 49:23.559
but not before he sustained
       third degree burns

49:23.561 --> 49:25.361
across 40 percent of his back.

49:27.265 --> 49:28.564
[exhales sharply]

49:29.467 --> 49:30.533
Jesus.

49:30.535 --> 49:32.034
I was arrested for arson,

49:33.271 --> 49:35.004
diagnosed with having
       a psychotic break

49:35.006 --> 49:37.506
by the esteemed
      Dr. Lawrence Powell,

49:37.508 --> 49:40.576
who then committed me
       to the psych ward.

49:40.578 --> 49:43.412
Your grandfather was the one
       who sent you away?

49:43.414 --> 49:44.613
My whole life.

49:46.217 --> 49:48.050
He shipped me
      to boarding school.

49:49.153 --> 49:52.088
Boarding school
      turned into college,

49:52.090 --> 49:53.489
and then I enlisted.

50:01.366 --> 50:04.166
Um, I was at
      this friend's party,

50:04.168 --> 50:06.268
I wasn't actually allowed
          to be there.

50:08.039 --> 50:10.606
And I kept seeing the caller ID
          on my phone.

50:12.477 --> 50:14.110
And I just kept thinking,

50:14.112 --> 50:15.244
I'm dead.

50:16.647 --> 50:19.148
My dad's actually gonna kill me.

50:19.150 --> 50:21.717
[Cleo] I didn't answer
the first three times he called.

50:25.490 --> 50:28.257
But then on the fourth,
 I ran outside somewhere quiet

50:28.259 --> 50:29.458
and I answered.

50:31.429 --> 50:33.229
[Cleo] <i> He was calling</i>
       <i> from the hospital.</i>

50:35.066 --> 50:38.167

50:38.803 --> 50:40.436
<i> They couldn't save her.</i>

50:42.206 --> 50:43.806
I just threw up, right there,

50:44.542 --> 50:46.742
on the lawn.

50:46.744 --> 50:50.212
[Cleo] People walking past,
           laughing.

50:50.214 --> 50:52.782
I just looked like any teenager
         at any party,

50:52.784 --> 50:54.450
who had had too much to drink.

50:58.689 --> 51:01.190
A week after the funeral,
   my dad went back to work,

51:01.192 --> 51:02.258
and...

   <i> stopped talking about it.</i>

The worst thing about it was...

51:19.110 --> 51:20.676
she didn't even seem depressed.

51:22.814 --> 51:24.480
[Cleo] <i> Nobody saw it coming.</i>

51:32.123 --> 51:33.456
Can we just watch some TV?

51:34.459 --> 51:35.591

  <i> there's no place to run to.</i>

53:46.724 --> 53:48.624
<i> I mean, if they did get in,</i>

53:48.626 --> 53:51.293
<i> there would be no back exit.</i>
       <i> We'd be done for.</i>

[flame roars]

55:00.598 --> 55:03.065
[screaming]

55:04.435 --> 55:06.302
Okay. All right.

55:06.871 --> 55:08.304
All right.

55:08.939 --> 55:10.572
Oh, my god.

55:10.574 --> 55:12.041
What's happening?

55:13.678 --> 55:15.577
[Mike]
Come and see me again next week.

55:15.579 --> 55:16.545
-[door opens]
    -[Aaron] Reverend Mike.

55:16.547 --> 55:18.013
[Mike] Aaron!

55:22.887 --> 55:23.953
[Mike] Change your mind
         about praying?

55:23.954 --> 55:25.020
"Suffering spirit.
     Suffer hell on earth."

55:25.022 --> 55:26.889
-Where'd you hear that?
        -Where did you?

55:28.626 --> 55:31.627
Did your grandfather
ever show you the archive room?

55:31.629 --> 55:33.762
[Mike] It was thought that
    some churches were built

55:33.764 --> 55:35.864
to fight the evil
     that plagued the area.

55:36.667 --> 55:38.000
The land was cursed.

55:38.969 --> 55:41.804
The church became a sanctuary.

55:41.806 --> 55:44.673
In the case
   of this particular church,

55:44.675 --> 55:47.509
it was built
    because of Buckout Road.

55:47.511 --> 55:49.478
You know about Buckout Road?

55:49.480 --> 55:52.448
Everyone here knows
      about Buckout Road.

55:52.450 --> 55:54.616
"The most haunted road
          in America."

56:04.428 --> 56:05.594
[Mike] Sumerian legend.

56:06.497 --> 56:08.864
Enki was lord of the earth,

56:08.866 --> 56:10.766
and Inanna was a deity.

56:10.768 --> 56:13.836
She was sent to hell.
    Enki tried to save her.

56:13.838 --> 56:16.505
She came back to Earth,
 but was accompanied by demons

56:16.507 --> 56:18.741
who insisted she wasn't free,

56:18.743 --> 56:21.410
until someone else
        took her place.

56:21.412 --> 56:23.078
Enki made the choice
        to replace her.

56:23.881 --> 56:25.481
It's an old fable.

56:25.483 --> 56:28.050
Passed down to many religions
      throughout history.

56:28.052 --> 56:30.018
Hindus call it Karma,

56:30.020 --> 56:33.389
we've come to understand it
       as Revelations 22,

56:33.391 --> 56:35.157
verses 18 through 19.

56:35.159 --> 56:37.459
"If any man shall add
       onto these things,

56:37.461 --> 56:38.894
God shall add
      onto him the plagues

56:38.896 --> 56:40.429
that are written in this book."

56:40.431 --> 56:41.764
Checks and balances.

56:41.766 --> 56:45.501
If you believe and respect,
    everything's in balance.

56:45.503 --> 56:46.635
If you don't,

56:46.971 --> 56:48.070
well...

56:49.106 --> 56:50.906
[paper rustling]

56:52.410 --> 56:54.060
What is that?

56:54.061 --> 56:55.711
[Mike] It's an ancient symbol
    predating Christianity.

56:55.713 --> 56:57.413
Roughly translated,

56:57.415 --> 56:59.181
"It's a call to serve."

56:59.183 --> 57:02.451
Zealots would often brand
themselves with it in obedience.

57:05.656 --> 57:08.490
[Aaron] Is there anything
 in that book about the evil?

57:08.492 --> 57:10.993
[Mike] There's whole sections
   about the devil demanding

57:10.995 --> 57:13.629
five sacrifices.

57:13.631 --> 57:15.597
Spirits of the departed
      guiding the living.

57:15.599 --> 57:17.132
Sending Satan back to hell.

57:17.134 --> 57:18.700
Wait, wait, wait.
  What, what did you just say?

57:18.702 --> 57:20.502
Sending Satan back to hell.

57:20.504 --> 57:22.070
No, about the spirits

57:22.072 --> 57:23.672
guiding the living.

57:23.674 --> 57:25.941
It's meant allegorically.

57:25.943 --> 57:27.843
It's the passing on
   of traditions and values,

57:27.845 --> 57:29.945
preparing one for the future.

57:29.947 --> 57:31.513
[Aaron] And you believe
        in all of this?

57:33.851 --> 57:37.085
I believe we've come a long way
    as a species since then.

57:39.056 --> 57:41.056
Things that were important then,

57:42.092 --> 57:43.859
just aren't very much today.

57:43.861 --> 57:46.094
But isn't it your job
          to believe?

57:46.096 --> 57:49.531
My job is to offer comfort
 and council for people who do.

57:51.602 --> 57:53.552
Look.

57:53.553 --> 57:55.503
it's getting late and I have
   a service to prepare for.

57:57.575 --> 57:58.941
If you'd like
     to come back tomorrow

57:58.943 --> 58:00.509
and talk some more,
        you're welcome.

58:06.684 --> 58:08.684
[Aaron] Well, well.

58:08.686 --> 58:10.886
Detective Harris.

58:10.888 --> 58:12.654
[Harris] You know, Aaron,

58:13.757 --> 58:15.491
lately I've been feeling
          a little bit

58:15.493 --> 58:16.959
like old Job over there.

58:19.096 --> 58:21.797
Like I'm constantly
         being tested.

58:23.234 --> 58:24.500
I don't know
     what the hell happened

58:24.502 --> 58:25.834
between you and Cleo last night,

58:25.836 --> 58:29.738
but she is not doing
    very well today at all.

58:29.740 --> 58:32.274
So, I'm going to ask you nicely.

58:33.110 --> 58:34.276
Please,

58:36.280 --> 58:37.880
stay away from her.

58:42.620 --> 58:44.186
She told me about
     her mother's suicide.

58:45.289 --> 58:47.656
Five years ago, right?

58:47.658 --> 58:49.658
She also told me how you
    shut her out afterwards.

58:50.628 --> 58:51.827
She needs you.

58:54.031 --> 58:55.097
Just...

58:55.799 --> 58:57.099
stay away.

58:59.937 --> 59:01.003
