MR. COUGHLAN:
Well, it's no paradise out on that island.

01:34.520 --> 01:37.000
Just want to make sure
you know what you're in for.

01:37.520 --> 01:39.887
All due respect, Mr. Coughlan,

01:40.840 --> 01:43.525
it's not likely to be tougher
than the Western Front.

01:45.160 --> 01:47.288
Oh, you're probably right about that.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.446
You pay your own passage to every posting.

01:52.880 --> 01:55.565
You're a relief worker
so you don't get holidays.

01:56.920 --> 01:59.160
I understand you're a single man.

01:59.240 --> 02:00.571
No family.

02:03.080 --> 02:05.447
So, that's a slight concern.

02:05.840 --> 02:07.720
Wouldn't normally send
a single man to Janus.

02:07.800 --> 02:09.080
It's pretty remote

02:09.160 --> 02:11.160

Janus isn't a particularly popular posting.

You'll be the only living man

05:59.800 --> 06:02.040
for a good part of
100 miles in any direction.

06:02.120 --> 06:04.600
I don't suppose they told you
why the position became available?

06:04.680 --> 06:06.160
CAPTAIN HASLUCK: Temporarily available.

06:06.240 --> 06:07.480
Trimble will be back,

06:07.560 --> 06:09.847
and good as new in six months.

06:10.320 --> 06:12.527
Just needs a bit of
recuperation time, that's all.

06:15.320 --> 06:16.606
(CLEARS THROAT)

06:16.800 --> 06:18.370
BILL: Did they inform you, Mr. Sherbourne?

06:18.480 --> 06:21.640
I don't believe anyone told me
about the specifics.

06:21.720 --> 06:22.920

06:23.000 --> 06:26.210
Trimble Docherty worked
the light for nearly six years.

06:27.400 --> 06:29.000
- Without incident.
- CAPTAIN HASLUCK: Mmm.

06:29.080 --> 06:30.160
Then he caused a stir

06:30.240 --> 06:32.925
when he reported that his wife has been
signaling the passing ships.

06:33.440 --> 06:35.360
Unacceptable, of course,
and for two reasons.

06:35.440 --> 06:37.840
Signaling passing ships
had long been forbidden precisely...

06:37.920 --> 06:40.048
Obviously, he knows that.

06:40.280 --> 06:42.120
MRS. HASLUCK: What was the other reason?

06:42.200 --> 06:44.328
His wife has been dead for two years.

06:46.320 --> 06:48.080
CAPTAIN HASLUCK:
Simple case of cabin fever

06:48.160 --> 06:50.527
plus a dose of grief, that's all.

06:50.720 --> 06:52.563
BILL: Mr. Sherbourne
should have been informed.

06:52.680 --> 06:55.206

TOM: I certainly appreciate
your telling me.

07:01.880 --> 07:05.521
And I hope Trimble
recovers from whatever is ailing him.

07:06.440 --> 07:08.886
As for the isolation,

07:09.400 --> 07:11.289
I feel I'm prepared for it.

07:12.280 --> 07:13.960

07:14.040 --> 07:15.451
the idea of a little time alone,

My brothers used to
tease me awfully when I played.

13:36.080 --> 13:37.923
I lost both of them.

13:39.080 --> 13:40.570
In the War.

13:42.240 --> 13:45.164
Just must be so confusing for my parents.

13:46.240 --> 13:48.242
I mean, if a wife loses a husband

13:48.360 --> 13:49.400
she becomes a widow,

13:49.480 --> 13:51.000
but if a parent loses a child

13:51.080 --> 13:53.401
there's no special label for it.

13:56.240 --> 13:58.527
You're still a mother or father.

13:59.680 --> 14:01.045
Even if you no longer have a child.

14:03.440 --> 14:05.283
Sometimes I wonder,

14:08.240 --> 14:10.561
if I'm still technically a sister

14:11.120 --> 14:13.407
now when my brothers are gone.

How long were you there, in the War?

Strict doesn't begin to describe it.

Still, though,

15:09.440 --> 15:11.568
made army discipline easy.

15:13.800 --> 15:15.848
I suppose it made it easier

15:15.960 --> 15:17.920
being over there,
knowing there'd be no one

15:18.000 --> 15:20.526
heartbroken if they got the telegram.

15:22.480 --> 15:24.847
(CHUCKLES) Don't say such a thing.

So if I can't talk about the past,

15:39.920 --> 15:42.440
am I allowed to talk about the future?

15:42.520 --> 15:46.844
We can't rightly talk about the future
if you think about it.

15:47.600 --> 15:51.207
We can only talk about
what we imagine or wish for.

That'll do me, I reckon.

16:25.720 --> 16:28.560
I want to see
where you hide yourself away.

must have given way,

He still had the accent, by all accounts.

- Yeah.

02:00:47.800 --> 02:00:49.484
Should we put it on you?

02:00:49.840 --> 02:00:51.763
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

02:00:52.840 --> 02:00:54.080
(GASPS)

02:00:54.160 --> 02:00:56.811
Oh, that looks so pretty.

02:00:59.040 --> 02:01:02.123
Oh, it's come off.
How about we put it around me?

02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:05.920
Make a daisy necklace? Let's try.

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:07.684
How about we, Grandpa...

02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:10.040
How about you could wear it on your head?

02:01:10.120 --> 02:01:12.400
All right. You want to put it on my head?

02:01:12.480 --> 02:01:13.680
And you could keep it.

02:01:13.760 --> 02:01:16.001
All right. Thank you, darling.

02:01:17.240 --> 02:01:18.526
Thank you.

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.526
ISABEL: Do you think God will forgive me?

02:01:41.040 --> 02:01:43.771
TOM: He forgave you a long time ago.

02:01:46.920 --> 02:01:49.491
It's about time you did, too.

02:02:27.760 --> 02:02:29.444
TOM: Afternoon.

02:02:30.200 --> 02:02:31.440
You lost?

02:02:31.760 --> 02:02:32.920
Hope not.

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
I'm searching for the Sherbourne property.

02:02:35.080 --> 02:02:36.605
Tom and Isabel?

02:02:37.400 --> 02:02:38.401
You've found it.

02:02:41.920 --> 02:02:44.287
My name is Lucy-Grace Rutherford.

02:02:47.080 --> 02:02:48.570
I'm Lucy.

02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:52.440
Lucy.

02:02:53.120 --> 02:02:55.771
I've got something to show you.

02:02:58.600 --> 02:03:00.125
(CAR DOOR OPENS)

02:03:09.480 --> 02:03:11.209
This is Christopher.

02:03:14.960 --> 02:03:17.247
TOM: She never stopped talking about you.

02:03:18.080 --> 02:03:19.809
She always hoped you would come.

02:03:22.960 --> 02:03:25.008
I couldn't come any sooner.

02:03:27.160 --> 02:03:30.846
I never had the chance to say thank you.
To both of you.

02:03:32.440 --> 02:03:34.010
For saving me.

02:03:34.920 --> 02:03:37.400
And taking such good care of me.

02:03:38.840 --> 02:03:41.127
There is nothing to thank us for.

02:03:44.840 --> 02:03:45.920
(CHRISTOPHER COOING)

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:47.001
(SOFTLY) Hey.

02:03:48.960 --> 02:03:50.689
She left something for you.

02:04:30.160 --> 02:04:32.561
ISABEL: My darling Lucy

02:04:35.840 --> 02:04:38.411
It has been such a long time.

02:04:40.240 --> 02:04:41.401
Hey.

02:04:43.480 --> 02:04:44.641
I'd promised

02:04:44.960 --> 02:04:48.089
I'd stay away from you
and I've stuck to my word.

02:04:49.080 --> 02:04:51.401
However hard that was for me.

02:04:52.320 --> 02:04:54.243
I'm gone now

02:04:54.360 --> 02:04:56.840
Which is why you have this letter.

02:04:57.520 --> 02:04:59.522
And it brings me joy

02:05:00.920 --> 02:05:03.161
because it means that you came to find us.

02:05:06.240 --> 02:05:08.925
I never gave up hope that you would.

02:05:11.200 --> 02:05:14.000
Knowing you were safe and loved

02:05:14.080 --> 02:05:17.687
allowed us to live
our lives away from you.

02:05:20.400 --> 02:05:22.721
I hope life has been kind to you.

02:05:24.560 --> 02:05:27.689
I hope that you can forgive me
for keeping you.

02:05:29.120 --> 02:05:31.088
And for letting you go.

02:05:33.040 --> 02:05:38.968
Know that you have always been beloved.

02:05:54.640 --> 02:05:56.210
TOM: Look at you.

02:05:57.960 --> 02:06:01.442
Isabel would have just
loved to have met you.

02:06:04.760 --> 02:06:06.489
She would have loved you.

02:06:14.960 --> 02:06:19.084
Could Christopher and I come back
and visit you again?

02:06:22.280 --> 02:06:24.408
I would like that very much.

02:06:27.800 --> 02:06:29.450
Great. (CHUCKLES)
