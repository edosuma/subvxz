00:02.900 --> 00:05.899
This demon, he's in Suzanne.

00:05.900 --> 00:07.620
You have to perform an exorcism.

00:10.100 --> 00:14.100
She's dead.

00:15.740 --> 00:17.019
Hello, Raquel.

00:17.020 --> 00:18.699
You need to tell me who this guy is.

00:18.700 --> 00:20.259
He's my demon dad.

00:20.260 --> 00:23.179
Then you're...

00:23.180 --> 00:24.220
Half demon.

00:31.260 --> 00:32.659
Was this him or her?

00:32.659 --> 00:34.099
Her.

00:34.100 --> 00:36.699
She's coming along nicely.

00:36.700 --> 00:40.700
Like a sweet cherry tomato
ripening on the vine.

01:20.780 --> 01:24.780
You killed me, you silly bitch.

01:25.140 --> 01:27.739
You should probably say something.

01:27.740 --> 01:31.740
You - you were dead... You died...

01:31.940 --> 01:34.139
How weird is that?
You were possessed.

01:34.140 --> 01:36.539
We - we were trying to get that
thing out of you.

01:36.540 --> 01:39.219
Yeah? Well, you suck at it.
Big time.

01:39.220 --> 01:43.220
You're alive?

01:43.420 --> 01:47.099
My hair is trashed.

01:47.100 --> 01:51.100
Look at this shit.

01:52.660 --> 01:53.939
Oh, my God.

01:53.940 --> 01:57.779
What? What is it?

01:57.780 --> 02:01.780
I'm hungry.

02:08.340 --> 02:12.340
Disgusting.

02:17.380 --> 02:21.380
Milk's off.

02:25.180 --> 02:29.139
This cheese is rank.

02:29.140 --> 02:33.059
What happened to you?
You mean after I died?

02:33.060 --> 02:36.979
It was all dark.
I could hear voices.

02:36.980 --> 02:39.819
Some seriously scary shit.

02:39.820 --> 02:43.820
I feel myself being pulled back,
like I'm being sucked out of there.

02:44.380 --> 02:47.019
I'm back in my body.
I can't breathe...

02:47.020 --> 02:49.819
My head was pounding -
the worst migraine.

02:49.820 --> 02:53.820
I started to get really cold and I just thought,
"Screw this. I'm just going to walk home."

02:54.740 --> 02:57.619
Jesus. Did you have to bury
me so far from home?

02:57.620 --> 02:58.979
Seriously. It took me forever.

02:58.980 --> 03:00.899
It felt like I was
Nelson Mandela when

03:00.900 --> 03:02.779
he walked to the ocean to
make salt.

03:02.780 --> 03:05.619
I'm pretty sure that was Gandhi.
The salt was Gandhi.

03:05.620 --> 03:08.699
Mandela was small shoes.
He wasn't just about the shoes...

03:08.700 --> 03:12.700
Whoever it was,
it was a bloody long walk.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.059
What is this?

03:14.060 --> 03:17.339
Pasta with a tomato and garlic
sauce. A few capers...

03:17.340 --> 03:21.340
It tastes like shit, actual shit.

03:23.060 --> 03:25.219
Why is there never
any food in this flat?

03:25.220 --> 03:29.220
There is.
Most of it's on the floor.

03:38.500 --> 03:41.419
I think that's you.

03:41.420 --> 03:45.420
Oh.

03:47.140 --> 03:48.339
Who is it?

03:48.340 --> 03:50.299
It's Matt. He wants me to go over.

03:50.300 --> 03:52.339
I really don't think that's
a good idea.

03:52.340 --> 03:54.699
We should go to hospital,
and get you checked out.

03:54.700 --> 03:57.539
We can say you OD'd on ketamine.
That's feasible.

03:57.540 --> 03:59.619
I'm fine. I don't want to be on
my own tonight.

03:59.620 --> 04:03.620
Can I sleep in with you?

04:12.660 --> 04:14.299
You died.

04:14.300 --> 04:18.300
Only for a bit.

04:19.540 --> 04:22.779
I'm sorry... I'm so sorry.

04:22.780 --> 04:24.019
It's OK.

04:24.020 --> 04:27.459
It is not OK.
It is so far from OK.

04:27.460 --> 04:28.819
Amy.

04:28.820 --> 04:30.419
I killed you.

04:30.420 --> 04:34.420
I forgive you. It all worked out.

04:36.380 --> 04:38.939
Snuggle up.

04:38.940 --> 04:42.940
Just because I died, doesn't mean we
can't snuggle. I'm cold.

04:43.540 --> 04:47.540
Snuggles.

05:00.420 --> 05:04.179
Are you wearing
a different perfume?

05:04.180 --> 05:07.979
It's the stuff you bought
me for my birthday.

05:07.980 --> 05:11.980
You smell weird.

05:24.500 --> 05:26.939
Hi. Suzanne's alive!
She came back to life.

05:26.940 --> 05:28.779
Are you shitting me?

05:28.780 --> 05:32.299
Seriously?
Seriously? Are you serious?

05:32.300 --> 05:33.939
'Yes, seriously. She's asleep.'

05:33.940 --> 05:37.339
We're in bed. We're snuggling.

05:37.340 --> 05:39.379
'Is that like... spooning?

05:39.380 --> 05:41.379
Are you naked? Is she naked?

05:41.380 --> 05:45.019
No. No-one is naked. Suzanne's
alive. She came back to life.

05:45.020 --> 05:46.579
What the hell is going on!?

05:46.580 --> 05:48.699
'I don't know. People coming back
from the dead.

05:48.700 --> 05:49.739
'This is all new to me.'

05:49.740 --> 05:51.459
'Why am I not surprised?'

05:51.460 --> 05:52.739
Do you want me to come over?

05:52.740 --> 05:54.939
I can come over and check her out.

05:54.940 --> 05:56.419
Come over first thing in the
morning.

05:56.420 --> 05:58.859
And Raquel, it would be really great
if you could figure out

05:58.860 --> 06:02.299
why I'm snuggling with my previously dead
best friend. Do you think you could do that?

06:02.300 --> 06:06.300
Mmm.
Great. 'Night.

She will suck you dry.

06:45.060 --> 06:49.060
Ugh. Call me.

07:12.580 --> 07:16.580
Suzanne!

07:19.300 --> 07:23.300
Suzanne!

07:34.020 --> 07:38.020
Suzanne!

07:48.660 --> 07:52.660
Hi.

07:56.220 --> 08:00.220
I hope you're feeling as
horny as I am.

08:05.220 --> 08:07.099
Suzanne's gone.
She isn't in the flat.

08:07.100 --> 08:10.779
You get my message about her being a blood sucking
monster bitch? What were you talking about?

08:10.780 --> 08:14.780
So I did some more research. Turns out she's not
really alive, not at all, uh, uh - not alive...

08:14.900 --> 08:18.419
Trust me. She's alive. I had her breathing
on my neck all night. I barely slept at all.

08:18.420 --> 08:20.139
You were spooning with a revenant.

08:20.140 --> 08:21.779
We weren't spooning.
What's a revenant?

08:21.780 --> 08:25.699
What they call someone who comes back from the dead.
Isn't that a zombie? I thought that's a zombie?

08:25.700 --> 08:29.259
She's not answering her phone. A zombie's
different. They've got that shuffly walk.

08:29.260 --> 08:30.819
They're all...

08:30.820 --> 08:34.419
Revenants crave the life force they lost
when they died, so they're not all...

08:34.419 --> 08:36.099
We have to find her.

08:36.100 --> 08:37.818
What does that even mean -
"the life force"?

08:37.820 --> 08:39.058
Girl wants to feel alive again.

08:39.059 --> 08:42.058
And the only way she can do that is
by feeding on blood.

08:42.059 --> 08:45.779
Yeah. She'll stick a straw in your vein and
suck that shit right out of you. Really? Mmm.

08:45.780 --> 08:49.299
If that's true, how come she didn't feed on
me? I spent all night spooning with her.

08:49.300 --> 08:53.219
Maybe it takes a while to kick in. It's like your
period. It's all peaches and cream, and then - Boom!

08:53.220 --> 08:55.419
They have to close
the swimming pool for a week.

08:55.420 --> 08:59.099
Do you know where she might have
gone? A friend's house, or...

08:59.100 --> 09:01.820
Oh shit.

09:03.780 --> 09:06.619
Suzanne?!

09:06.620 --> 09:10.620
Suzanne!? Suzanne!?

09:19.540 --> 09:20.820
Suzanne?

09:31.187 --> 09:35.187
I wanted to stop.

09:35.227 --> 09:38.346
I wanted to.

09:38.347 --> 09:42.347
I couldn't.

09:43.987 --> 09:47.987
My whole body was on fire.

09:48.027 --> 09:52.027
It was heaven.

09:52.507 --> 09:55.506
This is our fault.
We did this to her.

09:55.507 --> 09:57.026
That milk is spilt.

09:57.027 --> 09:59.666
Now unless you like licking floors,
you have to move on,

09:59.667 --> 10:01.426
go to the shop and buy some more.

10:01.427 --> 10:03.826
This isn't milk. That is true.

10:03.827 --> 10:05.586
What're we going to do with her?

10:05.587 --> 10:09.506
What do we do? OK. Here's the plan.

10:09.507 --> 10:12.786
We keep her snacked up
on animal blood.

10:12.787 --> 10:15.586
We take her out to the countryside,
where there's no people,

10:15.587 --> 10:18.946
we stay out there
whilst we try and find a cure.

10:18.947 --> 10:22.306
Seriously? That's the plan?
You want to go camping?

10:22.307 --> 10:26.307
Hey, Suzanne. How are you?

10:28.947 --> 10:32.947
You brought a canoe?
You said pack for camping.

10:51.147 --> 10:54.946
He's looking at me. It's like
he knows why we're buying him.

10:54.947 --> 10:57.146
I'm avoiding eye contact.

10:57.147 --> 10:59.906
How many do you reckon she'll get
through in a day?

10:59.907 --> 11:01.986
She's never been a big eater.

11:01.987 --> 11:04.986
I was actually worried
she might be anorexic.

11:04.987 --> 11:08.987
I really don't think you need to
worry about her anorexia any more...

11:14.027 --> 11:15.506
Demon prick. Where?

11:15.507 --> 11:19.507
The tropical fish section.

11:28.027 --> 11:30.786
Who's a pretty girl?

11:30.787 --> 11:32.546
Ssh.

11:32.547 --> 11:34.346
Who's a pretty girl?

11:34.347 --> 11:38.347
Shut up, you prick!
Shut up, you prick!

11:57.987 --> 12:00.426
Shut up, you prick.

12:00.427 --> 12:04.427
What the fuck?

12:12.347 --> 12:14.666
Drive. Go, go! What did you get?

12:14.667 --> 12:17.626
Guinea pigs.
They were three for two.

12:17.627 --> 12:20.667
It's a shame you couldn't have
p-p-p-p-picked up a penguin.

12:23.027 --> 12:27.027
Legend. Go! All right.

12:30.547 --> 12:32.106
A canoe?

12:32.107 --> 12:33.946
What were they doing with a canoe?

12:33.947 --> 12:36.666
I guess they were going canoeing.

12:36.667 --> 12:39.266
Is that supposed to be funny?

12:39.267 --> 12:41.466
Do you know how sick I am of
hiding in here,

12:41.467 --> 12:44.906
playing Doctor Feel-Good to
a bunch of perverts and freaks?

12:44.907 --> 12:48.907
Just once I'd like to lose my shit
and show them who I really am.

12:49.627 --> 12:53.627
Raquel can set us all free,
we can come out of the closet,

12:53.707 --> 12:55.786
and you're telling me
that you've lost her.

12:55.787 --> 12:59.787
Is that what you're telling me?

12:59.987 --> 13:03.266
Yes.

13:03.267 --> 13:07.267
Well, then I guess I'll just have to
find her on my own, then, won't I?

13:11.187 --> 13:14.626
Hi. Where's my car?

13:14.627 --> 13:16.026
What were you doing in the forest?

13:16.027 --> 13:18.586
Amy likes the smell of trees.

13:18.587 --> 13:21.986
She likes to sniff them. Hm.
Tyler says hi.

13:21.987 --> 13:23.626
Why does he say hi?

13:23.627 --> 13:26.706
We're going out to the house in
Lymebridge.

13:26.707 --> 13:30.586
He wants you to call him. Yeah,
I know. It's seriously weird...

13:30.587 --> 13:34.587
Yeah, er, bye!

13:49.867 --> 13:51.826
How come you know about this place?

13:51.827 --> 13:55.827
We used to come out here
when I was a kid.

14:06.427 --> 14:08.426
This is great, innit?
This is just perfect.

14:08.427 --> 14:10.986
This is exactly the type of place
I want to hang out with

14:10.987 --> 14:13.586
a ridiculously sexy,
blood-sucking monster.

14:13.587 --> 14:16.946
There's no-one around for miles.
There's no-one for her to feed on.

14:16.947 --> 14:20.226
No-one, except us.

14:20.227 --> 14:24.227
Oh, we did not think this through.

14:24.307 --> 14:27.906
Not at all.

14:27.907 --> 14:31.907
Yeah. We're basically breakfast,
lunch and dinner, aren't we?

14:33.787 --> 14:37.787
Keep smiling.

14:48.187 --> 14:52.187
Someone's living here.

14:55.067 --> 14:59.067
It was Sawyer.

15:03.707 --> 15:07.066
Who are they,
the people who killed him?

15:07.067 --> 15:08.706
I don't know.

15:08.707 --> 15:10.986
He said there's
some demon prick after me.

15:10.987 --> 15:13.826
A real bellend, apparently.

15:13.827 --> 15:15.866
There's no signal. I'm gonna go up
the hill,

15:15.867 --> 15:18.186
see if I can get any there.

15:18.187 --> 15:20.746
I'm really sorry...

15:20.747 --> 15:24.106
..about your dad.

15:24.107 --> 15:28.107
If Suzanne tries to eat you,
zap her arse.

15:29.307 --> 15:33.307
You just worry about finding
a cure, OK?

15:39.787 --> 15:43.746
Hi. I'm Dr Weaver from the
Psychiatric Referral Unit.

15:43.747 --> 15:45.586
I was looking for Raquel Francis.

15:45.587 --> 15:47.626
She's not here right now.

15:47.627 --> 15:49.826
Well, you must be her brother,
Tyler?

15:49.827 --> 15:51.066
What's this about?

15:51.067 --> 15:55.067
It's just that Raquel's missed
her last few appointments.

15:56.507 --> 16:00.507
You better come in. Thank you.

16:02.107 --> 16:05.186
Well, this is a nice space.
Great light.

16:05.187 --> 16:08.546
I've been thinking about buying
a flat around here as an investment.

16:08.547 --> 16:12.547
Do you er, would you ever think
about selling?

16:13.907 --> 16:15.786
No. Not really.

16:15.787 --> 16:19.466
Wait. Raquel told me she's been
going to all of her appointments.

16:19.467 --> 16:23.146
I'm afraid she's not been entirely
straight with you on that.

16:23.147 --> 16:26.506
You know, she talks about you a lot,

16:26.507 --> 16:28.426
how much you've done for her.

16:28.427 --> 16:29.826
Well, I do what I can.

16:29.827 --> 16:31.306
Well, if ever you want to talk,

16:31.307 --> 16:34.266
or if you're worried about Raquel,
you call me.

16:34.267 --> 16:35.706
Any time.

16:35.707 --> 16:38.626
Thank you. I appreciate it.

16:38.627 --> 16:42.627
Raquel's a special girl and I
really want to help her.

16:44.787 --> 16:48.426
I don't suppose you know
where she is?

16:48.427 --> 16:50.786
She's with her friend, Amy.

16:50.787 --> 16:52.786
They're in Lymebridge.

16:52.787 --> 16:55.226
She's somewhere in those woods.

16:55.227 --> 16:57.946
You find her
or I'll cut off your genitals

16:57.947 --> 17:01.947
and feed them to the badgers.

17:28.307 --> 17:31.146
Whoa! Easy. Who the hell are you?
I'm Harry.

17:31.147 --> 17:33.666
You creep up on me
and I'll crack your skull!

17:33.667 --> 17:36.706
I wasn't creeping up on you.
I was walking. This is my walk.

17:36.707 --> 17:40.707
What're you doing here, creepy walk?
Camping, in the woods.

17:41.107 --> 17:43.186
This is the only place you
get any bars. Yeah?

17:43.187 --> 17:45.426
I don't think so,
cos I don't like your face.

17:45.427 --> 17:48.186
Find another hill. I'm not finding
another hill. You don't own it.

17:48.187 --> 17:50.786
Yeah, well, I was here first,
so that makes it mine.

17:50.787 --> 17:53.946
That's not how the ownership of
hills works.

17:53.947 --> 17:55.466
I'm sorry I startled you.

17:55.467 --> 17:57.746
I'm going to go and sit on that bit
of hill, over there.

17:57.747 --> 17:59.506
Yeah? Well, you can sit on this!

17:59.507 --> 18:03.507
I appreciate the offer,
but the grass is fine.

18:26.907 --> 18:30.907
I'll get you something to eat.

18:39.907 --> 18:43.907
'Today, I wanted to talk about
exorcisms.

18:44.107 --> 18:45.986
'There are certain pitfalls
with an exorcism

18:45.987 --> 18:47.746
'and things you
have to watch out for.'

18:47.747 --> 18:50.786
Oh, shit. 'When playing with
spirits things can go really...'

18:50.787 --> 18:53.906
'..really, really...'

18:53.907 --> 18:56.946
What are you finding so funny?
Sorry, it's just a friend of mine.

18:56.947 --> 18:59.026
He just started seeing this girl.

18:59.027 --> 19:00.786
She's allergic to his cat.

19:00.787 --> 19:03.226
She wants him to get rid of it,
but he really loves that cat.

19:03.227 --> 19:05.346
He's had her for years.
Then the girlfriend has to go.

19:05.347 --> 19:07.786
His girlfriend obviously does things
for him that the cat is

19:07.787 --> 19:10.106
unwilling, or unable to do.
Could shave her.

19:10.107 --> 19:13.466
His girlfriend?
Shave the cat numb-nuts.

19:13.467 --> 19:15.266
It's the hair
that causes the allergy.

19:15.267 --> 19:18.626
A bald cat? Yeah, that could work.

19:18.627 --> 19:22.627
I'll message him. Thanks.

19:24.787 --> 19:26.266
Do you want a Starburst?

19:26.267 --> 19:27.986
It's my last two.

19:27.987 --> 19:31.826
Green or red?

19:31.827 --> 19:33.266
No? Green.

19:33.267 --> 19:37.267
Good choice. Tangy lime.

19:37.427 --> 19:41.427
So apart from using your creepy walk
to go sneaking up on people,

19:42.587 --> 19:43.986
what are you doing here?

19:43.987 --> 19:46.026
I come out here sometimes,

19:46.027 --> 19:48.266
when things get a bit on top,

19:48.267 --> 19:49.946
get away from everyone, you know.

19:49.947 --> 19:51.586
You probably think that's
a bit weird.

19:51.587 --> 19:54.546
I don't think that's weird at all.

19:54.547 --> 19:58.506
I get it. What about you - what are
you doing out here?

19:58.507 --> 20:01.066
I'm just here with some friends,

20:01.067 --> 20:05.067
just hanging out, camping.

20:05.307 --> 20:07.106
We like to camp.

20:07.107 --> 20:11.107
What's your name?

20:12.147 --> 20:14.866
It's fine. I'll shut up and
mind my own business.

20:14.867 --> 20:17.186
I'm all done.
You can have your hill back.

20:17.187 --> 20:20.546
Thanks for sharing it with me.

20:20.547 --> 20:23.386
It's Raquel.

20:23.387 --> 20:26.146
OK.

20:26.147 --> 20:29.746
Well, nice to meet you, Raquel.

20:29.747 --> 20:32.106
Maybe I'll see you back here
tomorrow.

20:32.107 --> 20:40.107
Maybe.

21:00.194 --> 21:01.393
How is she?

21:01.394 --> 21:03.713
She's just been lying there like
that for hours.

21:03.714 --> 21:07.714
Did you find anything?

21:08.194 --> 21:09.273
What?

21:09.274 --> 21:12.593
I didn't find no cure.
I know why she's a revenant.

21:12.594 --> 21:14.953
Why she's all blood sucky.

21:14.954 --> 21:16.673
It's because of me.

21:16.674 --> 21:17.793
What do you mean?

21:17.794 --> 21:21.233
If you're half-human half-demon,
it seems you act like a bridge.

21:21.234 --> 21:22.873
A bridge...? A gateway.

21:22.874 --> 21:25.713
Between this world
and the underworld.

21:25.714 --> 21:27.313
When Suzanne died,

21:27.314 --> 21:31.314
her soul came trip-trapping back
over the bridge into this world.

21:32.714 --> 21:33.873
My mum always said,

21:33.874 --> 21:37.433
"Raquel, take your head out your
arse and do your homework."

21:37.434 --> 21:41.434
Maybe I never did take my head
out my arse, not really.

21:54.514 --> 21:57.513
So there's this
cute little boy, Max.

21:57.514 --> 22:01.273
His dad's tucking him into bed
at night, kisses him,

22:01.274 --> 22:04.273
tells him how he loves him more than
anything else in the world.

22:04.274 --> 22:08.274
Max says, "Daddy, can you check
for monsters under my bed?"

22:09.274 --> 22:13.274
His dad says, "Max, there's
no such thing as monsters."

22:13.474 --> 22:17.474
He says, "Please, Daddy,
I'm scared."

22:17.554 --> 22:21.554
So his dad kneels down and looks
underneath the bed and there

22:24.554 --> 22:27.233
staring right back at him

22:27.234 --> 22:29.073
he sees another Max.

22:29.074 --> 22:33.074
Shaking and quivering with fear,
he whispers,

22:34.314 --> 22:36.873
"There's someone in my bed."

22:36.874 --> 22:38.753
So they're twins?

22:38.754 --> 22:41.433
What? No! It was before IVF.

22:41.434 --> 22:43.833
There weren't loads of freaky
little twins running about.

22:43.834 --> 22:46.393
No, the lad that was in his
bed was an impostor.

22:46.394 --> 22:48.873
I told that to Simon Hall on the
geography field trip

22:48.874 --> 22:51.953
and he shat himself. Literally.

22:51.954 --> 22:53.633
Turns out he had Crohn's disease,

22:53.634 --> 22:55.713
so that might have
been something to do with it.

22:55.714 --> 22:56.953
I remember that field trip.

22:56.954 --> 22:58.753
I bet you do.

22:58.754 --> 23:01.113
What?

23:01.114 --> 23:02.993
Oh. No. It's nothing...

23:02.994 --> 23:06.994
Just some big secret you want
to keep to yourself. That's fine.

23:07.874 --> 23:09.913
It's incredibly rude, but it's fine.

23:09.914 --> 23:12.793
Did you participate
in a campfire circle jerk?

23:12.794 --> 23:14.433
I don't even know what that is.

23:14.434 --> 23:18.393
It's when you've got two
blokes and... I can guess.

23:18.394 --> 23:20.233
Can everyone stop staring at me?

23:20.234 --> 23:22.393
We'll stop staring when you tell
us what disgusting,

23:22.394 --> 23:24.713
perverted thing you did on
your geography field trip.

23:24.714 --> 23:26.713
Did it involve shitting in
a sleeping bag? No.

23:26.714 --> 23:28.073
Shitting on a fire?

23:28.074 --> 23:31.273
In a cooler? In a tub of margarine?
An empty crisp packet?

23:31.274 --> 23:34.513
No, no, no. Shitting in a baguette,
like they do in France?

23:34.514 --> 23:36.473
You may as well just tell them.

23:36.474 --> 23:39.113
Come on, Amy. Just tell us.

23:39.114 --> 23:40.513
A farmer's wife?

23:40.514 --> 23:42.753
I had sex with Mr Williams.

23:42.754 --> 23:46.754
Mr Williams? Mr Williams
as in the geography teacher?

23:47.674 --> 23:49.153
He wore glasses.

23:49.154 --> 23:51.874
So now you know.
I hope you're all happy.

23:59.994 --> 24:03.553
I shouldn't have said anything about
Mr Williams. I'm sorry.

24:03.554 --> 24:07.554
It's fine. I saw him the other
day in the supermarket.

24:07.634 --> 24:10.633
He was with his wife,
it was so embarrassing,

24:10.634 --> 24:14.634
I don't know what I was thinking.

24:20.594 --> 24:24.594
Feels like a long time ago.

24:29.194 --> 24:33.194
Call out if you need anything.

24:33.234 --> 24:35.033
Night.

24:35.034 --> 24:38.234
Night.

26:39.074 --> 26:40.833
No. It wasn't the worm.

26:40.834 --> 26:42.313
It was the bird that was early.

26:42.314 --> 26:45.713
The worm got eaten. Had its guts
pecked right out of it.

26:45.714 --> 26:48.833
Right. Early bird.

26:48.834 --> 26:50.593
I see you got my bracelet?

26:50.594 --> 26:51.953
Yes.

26:51.954 --> 26:54.593
I ate the sweet. Thank you.

26:54.594 --> 26:56.153
It's just a few twigs.

26:56.154 --> 26:58.673
Did you know they don't have an
Accessorize out here?

26:58.674 --> 27:00.394
It's utter madness.

27:02.314 --> 27:06.314
Anyway.
I'll shut up and let you get on.

27:18.074 --> 27:22.074
Last night.
What were you dreaming about?

27:23.474 --> 27:25.033
The way you looked at me.

27:25.034 --> 27:26.313
I don't remember.

27:26.314 --> 27:28.753
You are the worst liar.

27:28.754 --> 27:31.233
Just tell me. Amy...

27:31.234 --> 27:35.234
I don't remember.

27:42.754 --> 27:45.833
You don't have to sit your boney
arse all the way over there,

27:45.834 --> 27:47.353
if you don't want to.

27:47.354 --> 27:51.354
You can, you don't have to...

27:53.274 --> 27:57.274
I'm crossing the hill.

28:00.514 --> 28:04.514
Wow. You look totally
different from over here.

28:05.274 --> 28:06.753
The face looks bigger.

28:06.754 --> 28:10.754
It's a whole new world.

28:13.434 --> 28:16.633
Well, I can't sit looking at your
freakishly big face all day.

28:16.634 --> 28:20.634
It is massive.

28:27.194 --> 28:31.194
Do you want to come and sit outside?

28:32.834 --> 28:36.473
You think I want to keep
you chained up?

28:36.474 --> 28:39.513
It's just until we find a cure.

28:39.514 --> 28:42.873
It feels like my stomach
is eating itself.

28:42.874 --> 28:45.153
It hurts.

28:45.154 --> 28:48.033
It really hurts.

28:48.034 --> 28:52.034
Just let me go. I won't feed on you.
I wouldn't do that.

28:53.714 --> 28:57.714
I could find a paedophile,
or a rapist.

28:57.794 --> 29:01.273
Some horrible low-life scumbag.

29:01.274 --> 29:03.513
Just let me eat a rapist.

29:03.514 --> 29:05.473
I can't do that.

29:05.474 --> 29:08.113
Untie me, you bitch!

29:08.114 --> 29:09.593
Let me go!

29:09.594 --> 29:11.273
Let me go!

29:11.274 --> 29:12.713
I'm sorry.

29:12.714 --> 29:15.753
Let me go!

29:15.754 --> 29:18.993
Oh, my God. He did it.

29:18.994 --> 29:21.793
He got drunk last night and
shaved his cat.

29:21.794 --> 29:23.873
What the hell?!

29:23.874 --> 29:26.673
That is freaky as all shit!
I can't be looking at that.

29:26.674 --> 29:28.513
I never thought he'd actually do it.

29:28.514 --> 29:32.514
I mean, I guess it will grow back.

29:36.114 --> 29:37.313
What?

29:37.314 --> 29:40.673
What's with the truncheon?

29:40.674 --> 29:44.674
My nonna always said, "Speak softly,
and if they don't listen",

29:45.594 --> 29:47.473
"hit them with a big stick."

29:47.474 --> 29:51.474
It's good advice.

29:53.794 --> 29:55.033
What?

29:55.034 --> 29:56.753
No, I was just thinking...

29:56.754 --> 29:57.873
What?

29:57.874 --> 30:01.874
Just meeting you like this. I'm
not saying it's anything it isn't...

30:03.834 --> 30:07.834
..but I'm glad it happened.

30:08.434 --> 30:10.033
I have to go.

30:10.034 --> 30:11.593
Will I see you again?

30:11.594 --> 30:13.993
This is the only place you can
get a phone signal,

30:13.994 --> 30:15.353
so I guess I'll be back tomorrow.

30:15.354 --> 30:17.913
For the phone signal. Right. Mm.

30:17.914 --> 30:21.914
Yeah. Me too.

30:29.434 --> 30:31.473
She's changing.

30:31.474 --> 30:33.393
The way that she looks at me.

30:33.394 --> 30:35.513
I don't know what to say to her.

30:35.514 --> 30:37.193
I feel like I'm losing her.

30:37.194 --> 30:39.193
It's only going to get worse.

30:39.194 --> 30:41.193
We need to think about what
we're going to do.

30:41.194 --> 30:43.113
We're going to keep looking
until we find a cure.

30:43.114 --> 30:45.833
I'm not even thinking about anything
else, and neither should you.

30:45.834 --> 30:48.353
Whatever you say.

30:48.354 --> 30:49.753
But I will say this.

30:49.754 --> 30:53.553
De-Nile isn't just a river in Egypt.

30:53.554 --> 30:55.233
Denial, as in a state of denial.

30:55.234 --> 30:56.833
Yeah. I got it the first time.

30:56.834 --> 30:57.993
Right.

30:57.994 --> 31:01.994
You know your rivers, cos you had
sex with your geography teacher.

31:05.994 --> 31:09.994
Yeah, I did.

31:14.674 --> 31:17.113
Hello?

31:17.114 --> 31:21.114
Jake?

31:28.194 --> 31:29.833
I've been calling you.

31:29.834 --> 31:32.953
I really need a wee.
Have you got the key?

31:32.954 --> 31:34.433
Erm...

31:34.434 --> 31:38.434
Will you hurry!
I'm going to piss myself.

31:44.754 --> 31:47.793
Please.

31:47.794 --> 31:50.473
Hurry!

31:50.474 --> 31:54.474
OK.

32:02.674 --> 32:06.674
Shit!

32:12.434 --> 32:14.394
Jesus, what the...

32:16.034 --> 32:21.314
Where did she go?

32:19.997 --> 32:23.997
Suzanne!

32:37.637 --> 32:39.036
We have to find her.

32:39.037 --> 32:42.756
There's actually a part of me that's
more worried about her finding us.

32:42.757 --> 32:46.757
Suzanne!

32:49.357 --> 32:53.357
Suzanne!

32:54.717 --> 32:58.717
Over there!

33:02.637 --> 33:04.916
Where's Raquel?

33:04.917 --> 33:08.277
Raquel?

33:14.877 --> 33:18.877
Raquel?

33:41.397 --> 33:43.116
I've seen this.

33:43.117 --> 33:47.117
Amy! C'mon!

35:15.197 --> 35:17.156
Jesus.
You scared the crap out of me?

35:17.157 --> 35:19.356
Sorry. What're you doing out here?

35:19.357 --> 35:21.236
I was out for a ramble.

35:21.237 --> 35:22.756
I saw a light through the trees.

35:22.757 --> 35:25.036
So you weren't out here
looking for me?

35:25.037 --> 35:26.116
What? No.

35:26.117 --> 35:27.356
It's OK if you were.

35:27.357 --> 35:29.196
I wasn't, so don't even go there.

35:29.197 --> 35:31.116
Well, sorry. I just thought...

35:31.117 --> 35:33.516
You come stumbling into my camp and
start pressing your hand

35:33.517 --> 35:34.796
against me tent.

35:34.797 --> 35:37.396
You think I go wandering round,
pressing myself against tents?

35:37.397 --> 35:38.436
Well, someone was.

35:38.437 --> 35:40.356
What was that?

35:40.357 --> 35:44.357
Er... Nothing. That was probably
a deer or a badger.

35:44.637 --> 35:45.916
Noisy pricks.

35:45.917 --> 35:48.916
OK. This is getting weird.
What is going on?

35:48.917 --> 35:50.676
Someone was pressing
against my tent.

35:50.677 --> 35:52.676
If it wasn't you, who was it?

35:52.677 --> 35:55.996
It... it was me.

35:55.997 --> 35:57.636
Why?

35:57.637 --> 36:01.637
Why does any girl going rambling
around the woods in the dark

36:02.637 --> 36:05.156
pressing herself against tents?

36:05.157 --> 36:09.156
So she can get your number,
so she can facetime you.

36:09.157 --> 36:11.636
Right. Yeah. Facetime. Mm-hm.

36:11.637 --> 36:15.637
It's 07700900545.

36:16.197 --> 36:20.197
Good. OK. Got it, tent boy, and I'll
message you mine as soon as I get signal.

36:21.957 --> 36:24.556
Who is that?

36:24.557 --> 36:27.636
That's my friends.
They're probably all lost and shit.

36:27.637 --> 36:31.236
I better go. OK.

36:31.237 --> 36:32.676
Well, thanks for stopping by.

36:32.677 --> 36:34.716
Any time. We'll facetime.

36:34.717 --> 36:38.717
Definitely.

36:55.157 --> 36:59.157
Amy?

37:00.877 --> 37:04.877
Jake?

37:06.437 --> 37:08.956
OK.

37:08.957 --> 37:12.276
Then I'm guessing it's you.

37:12.277 --> 37:16.277
You must be feeling pretty hungry
for some blood about now...

37:17.957 --> 37:20.396
..so why don't you come and get it?

37:20.397 --> 37:22.756
Bet you can practically taste it.

37:22.757 --> 37:26.756
It's all red and juicy.

37:26.757 --> 37:30.757
Mm-mm.

37:33.997 --> 37:37.997
There you are. You don't understand
what it's like.

37:39.037 --> 37:43.037
It hurts. All right, I get it.

37:50.077 --> 37:52.836
You can chow down.

37:52.837 --> 37:56.837
I can lose a pint or two.

38:04.037 --> 38:06.357
Oh. Battery's flat.

38:09.997 --> 38:12.396
C'mon now.

38:12.397 --> 38:14.677
I'm sorry.

38:25.637 --> 38:29.116
Raquel. Raquel.

38:29.117 --> 38:31.036
What happened? You're bleeding.

38:31.037 --> 38:33.076
Suzanne. She was feeding on me.

38:33.077 --> 38:35.636
Where is she? Raquel?

38:35.637 --> 38:39.637
They took her.
She was going to suck me dry.

38:39.837 --> 38:41.036
They saved my life.

38:41.037 --> 38:42.476
Who? Who took her?

38:42.477 --> 38:46.477
The demon pricks.

38:56.277 --> 39:00.156
Ever since I was 14,
I've been wasting these pricks,

39:00.157 --> 39:02.916
then they go and save my life.

39:02.917 --> 39:06.276
Why would they do that?

39:06.277 --> 39:08.076
Something isn't right.

39:08.077 --> 39:11.516
Well, whatever's happening,
it's not happening out here.

39:11.517 --> 39:15.517
We have to try and find Suzanne.

40:09.237 --> 40:12.116
Morning.

40:12.117 --> 40:15.996
Where am I? Well, I guess you'd call
it my luxury apartment.

40:15.997 --> 40:19.997
I sound like a pretentious dick,
don't I?

40:21.757 --> 40:23.156
Who are you?

40:23.157 --> 40:26.876
Well, that is a question with
more than one answer.

40:26.877 --> 40:30.877
Perhaps we should start with "Who's
he?"

40:31.157 --> 40:33.636
Now, he is breakfast

40:33.637 --> 40:34.956
for you.

40:34.957 --> 40:38.236
I'm having huevos
rancheros. Have you ever tried it?

40:38.237 --> 40:42.196
It's fried eggs, refried beans,
rice and avocado served on corn

40:42.197 --> 40:46.197
tortillas, topped off with
a chilli and tomato sauce.

40:47.797 --> 40:50.156
That's the thing about chilli.

40:50.157 --> 40:53.156
It's like blood.

40:53.157 --> 40:56.236
You get a real taste for it.

40:56.237 --> 40:58.916
I couldn't let you kill Raquel.

40:58.917 --> 41:02.917
She doesn't know it yet,
but she's special.

41:02.997 --> 41:06.997
She's a real game changer.
You're living proof of it.

41:08.077 --> 41:12.077
Well, not so much living.

41:13.757 --> 41:14.996
What do you want?

41:14.997 --> 41:18.996
I don't want to sound melodramatic,
but I want to change the world.

41:18.997 --> 41:21.756
A new dawn.

41:21.757 --> 41:23.516
Your...

41:23.517 --> 41:26.716
Your little blonde friend, Amy.
She's...

41:26.717 --> 41:30.717
Well, she's proving to be
a real pain in my arsehole.

41:36.077 --> 41:40.077
I'm thinking you could be very
useful to me.

41:40.797 --> 41:44.797
Think of yourself as
a perfectly formed little cog.

41:46.237 --> 41:50.196
A lever might be a better analogy.

41:50.197 --> 41:52.036
You're a lever.

41:52.037 --> 41:54.677
And when the time's right...

41:58.157 --> 42:02.157
Ah. My tortillas.

42:04.037 --> 42:08.037
Enjoy your breakfast.

42:21.237 --> 42:25.116
Suzanne, where are you?

42:25.117 --> 42:28.876
Sometimes I feel like just fucking
off to the Seychelles.

42:28.877 --> 42:32.877
Screw you!

42:34.797 --> 42:38.596
They told me to do it.

42:38.597 --> 42:41.076
I'm so sorry.
