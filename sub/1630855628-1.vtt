WEBVTT

00:39.165 --> 00:40.499
Oh, crap.

00:56.015 --> 00:57.141
Shit.

01:09.820 --> 01:12.156
- Oh, God.
-  <i>Hey, thinking about tonight.</i>

01:12.156 --> 01:13.616
<i>Why don't we just stay in?</i>

01:13.616 --> 01:17.077
<i>Hang out and talk about life, you know?</i>

01:17.077 --> 01:20.581
Sounds refreshing, but I have
my sister's engagement thing tonight.

01:20.581 --> 01:23.334
 <i>Oh, hell yeah, I'm in!
I'll be there.</i>

01:23.334 --> 01:25.753
Oh, no. No, it's... it's family stuff,

01:25.753 --> 01:28.547
so you could totally be out
if you wanted to.

01:28.547 --> 01:32.593
<i>Okay, listen, Nicole,
uh, I actually think that we need to talk.</i>

01:32.593 --> 01:35.638
Okay, aren't we currently talking
right now? I don't...

01:35.638 --> 01:38.057
<i>You are completely shut off.</i>

01:38.057 --> 01:39.892
 I'm not.

01:40.768 --> 01:42.061
I am not shut off.
I don't know.

01:42.061 --> 01:45.606
<i>I feel like you're incapable
of loving anyone.</i>

01:45.606 --> 01:47.066
Chaim, can we just, like...

01:47.066 --> 01:49.944
<i>That's not even my name. It's Chaim.</i>

01:49.944 --> 01:51.403
Okay, Chaim.

01:51.403 --> 01:53.280
-  <i>Chaim</i>!
- Chaim.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.365
 <i>Chaim</i>!

01:54.365 --> 01:56.659
I'm saying that. Look, I'm sorry.

01:56.659 --> 01:59.578
<i>Pull up to the next window.</i>

02:02.832 --> 02:04.124
<i>Hey, sweetie.</i>

02:04.124 --> 02:05.584
- Latte with oat?
- Yeah.

02:05.584 --> 02:07.086
<i>Is that a girl? Oh, my...</i>

02:07.086 --> 02:08.879
- No. I'm not... It's...
-<i>Did she spend the night</i>?

02:08.879 --> 02:10.965
- I'm at a drive-thru. Goodbye, goodbye.
-<i>Is she cute</i>?

02:10.965 --> 02:13.175
- Um, here you go.
- Oh, thank you.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.136
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

02:20.683 --> 02:22.393
Just a quick sanitize.

02:22.393 --> 02:24.186
 <i>This is KCLW,</i>

02:24.186 --> 02:27.273
<i>and you're listening to
We Chill Radio Station in Seattle.</i>

02:27.273 --> 02:30.484
<i>Next up, we have a track
that will ease your mind</i>

02:30.484 --> 02:32.528
<i>and kick-start your morning
with some meditative...</i>

02:32.528 --> 02:36.073
<i>There was that one time where I was
telling you about a dream that I had.</i>

02:36.073 --> 02:37.324
Oh. My lip balm.

02:37.324 --> 02:39.076
<i>You don't even talk to me
about your dreams.</i>

02:39.076 --> 02:40.703
<i>And it's another pleasant day.</i>

02:40.703 --> 02:43.873
- Fuck! What the fuck?

02:45.332 --> 02:46.834
-  <i>...and to share an emotional...</i>
- Got it.

02:46.834 --> 02:48.586
- Thank you.

02:48.586 --> 02:50.838
<i>60,000 fans will be there
to cheer them on.</i>

02:51.422 --> 02:55.092
 <i>Welcome to
your guided meditation experience.</i>

02:55.759 --> 02:58.429
<i>Before we begin, remind yourself
that this is a time...</i>

02:58.429 --> 03:01.515
-  Okay, I can do it.
-<i>...for you and you alone.</i>

03:01.515 --> 03:04.727
I'm just gonna walk into the office

03:04.727 --> 03:07.646
and not be weird.

03:07.646 --> 03:13.485
-  <i>Relax your neck and shoulders.</i>
- They're just people that I actually know.

03:15.029 --> 03:17.990
<i>Deepen your breath in through the nose...</i>

03:17.990 --> 03:19.617
- Okay.
-<i>...and out through the mouth.</i>

03:21.911 --> 03:23.537
I hate people. I hate people.

03:23.537 --> 03:26.332
- Yeah. God.

03:26.332 --> 03:27.875
- Yeah, okay!

03:30.210 --> 03:31.337
<i>And travel your consciousness down...</i>

03:31.337 --> 03:32.421
Okay.

03:32.421 --> 03:34.298
- God...

03:35.466 --> 03:37.134
<i>Bro, this is getting ridiculous.</i>

03:37.134 --> 03:38.844
<i>I was planning on coming in.</i>

03:38.844 --> 03:41.805
<i>It's just, my uncle's in the hospital
with, um, a thing.</i>

03:41.805 --> 03:43.641
- And, um...
- <i>You're such a liar, Max.</i>

03:43.641 --> 03:45.809
Someone already saw you outside.

03:45.809 --> 03:47.937
And I'm looking at you
from my window right now...

03:48.938 --> 03:50.773
circling the parking lot
looking like a freak.

03:50.773 --> 03:52.399
Look like a student driver, bro.

03:52.983 --> 03:53.984
I...

03:53.984 --> 03:56.236
Look, I know things are rough,

03:56.236 --> 03:57.863
-<i>man, but...</i>
- You don't...

03:57.863 --> 03:59.573
Are you okay?

03:59.573 --> 04:01.992
I can't explain it, okay?
I just... I... I don't know.

04:01.992 --> 04:03.202
I mean, my... my...

04:03.202 --> 04:06.163
my heart's beating really fast,
and I'm... I'm sweating,

04:06.163 --> 04:07.748
and I just, um... It's just...

04:07.748 --> 04:10.292
You are really taking advantage
of my post-COVID,

04:10.292 --> 04:12.044
very liberal work-from-home policy.

04:12.044 --> 04:15.464
- This is a real condition, Sid. Okay?
- I know, social anxiety is real.

04:15.464 --> 04:17.466
I feel for you, dawg.
I seen the commercials.

04:17.466 --> 04:20.803
<i>You gotta snap that shit quick,
'cause I can't protect you anymore.</i>

04:21.261 --> 04:22.513
You're gonna get canned.

04:22.513 --> 04:25.015
I can't do it. I can't do it.

04:25.015 --> 04:27.267
I'm going to talk to my fucking therapist.

04:29.311 --> 04:31.730
I blew off the office. Again.

04:31.730 --> 04:33.232
I did go get coffee,

04:33.232 --> 04:36.318
but, um, it was the...
it was the drive-thru.

04:37.027 --> 04:39.446
- Sorry.
-<i>No need to apologize, Max.</i>

04:39.446 --> 04:44.410
Yeah. No, no, I know. I just... You know,
I just feel like a helpless idiot.

04:44.410 --> 04:46.578
<i>Well, I don't listen to helpless idiots.</i>

04:47.496 --> 04:48.497
Uh...

04:49.373 --> 04:51.208
you're my therapist, so...

04:51.208 --> 04:52.292
<i>It's called mirroring.</i>

04:52.292 --> 04:53.919
-<i>It's a therapy technique.</i>
- Oh.

04:53.919 --> 04:56.171
<i>Shows you how you talk about yourself.</i>

04:56.171 --> 04:58.674
Oh, wow, that's... that's cool. Um...

04:58.674 --> 05:00.217
And that... that's supposed to help?

05:00.217 --> 05:01.719
<i>Rarely.</i>

05:01.719 --> 05:06.098
<i>Perhaps now it's time to introduce
something a little different.</i>

05:06.098 --> 05:07.725
Oh, yeah? Something else?

05:07.725 --> 05:08.976
<i>Pet therapy.</i>

05:08.976 --> 05:10.644
-<i>Now listen,</i>

05:10.644 --> 05:14.440
<i>if you can talk to a dog
and make an emotional connection,</i>

05:14.440 --> 05:17.693
<i>it can help you learn
how to connect with people.</i>

05:17.693 --> 05:20.195
- Um...
-<i>Dogs teach acceptance.</i>

05:20.195 --> 05:23.866
It's just, you know, a dog is a serious
invasion of my, um, of my space.

05:23.866 --> 05:26.869
<i>Max, we need to take some bold steps here.</i>

05:26.869 --> 05:30.039
- I'm... I'm not sure I'm capable...
-<i>Do you have a problem with dogs, Max?</i>

05:30.039 --> 05:31.373
Well, I just...

05:31.373 --> 05:33.834
I don't have a problem with a dog.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.086
<i>"I don't have a problem with a dog."</i>

05:36.086 --> 05:37.337
- What?
-<i>"What?"</i>

05:37.337 --> 05:39.381
- I'm sorry.
-<i>I'm sorry. I just...</i>

05:41.383 --> 05:42.634
That was mirroring.

05:42.634 --> 05:45.012
<i>Mirroring. Mm-hmm.</i>

05:45.012 --> 05:47.765
- Um...
-<i>Go out, Max.</i>

05:47.765 --> 05:52.770
<i>Go out and make a canine connection.</i>

05:53.353 --> 05:54.354
Yeah, I get it.

05:55.647 --> 05:56.648
Hey.

05:56.648 --> 05:59.735
- Whatever-his-name broke up with me.
- Oh, no. Really?

05:59.735 --> 06:03.530
Yeah. He said I was closed off,
but, like, I let him in.

06:03.530 --> 06:04.907
Like, in.

06:04.907 --> 06:07.117
You know there are
other kinds of intimacy, right?

06:07.117 --> 06:08.535
All the way in.

06:08.535 --> 06:11.246
I'm just worried
Bumble's gonna raise its price on ya.

06:11.246 --> 06:13.749
Listen, I just have a lot
going on right now with work

06:13.749 --> 06:15.250
and just, like, life in general.

06:15.250 --> 06:17.878
And I know that I have my needs,
but I don't need a guy for that.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.630
Serious question.

06:19.630 --> 06:22.800
Do I put my real height in my profile
or my height in heels?

06:22.800 --> 06:26.553
- Uh, not needed. Tonight we're going out.
-  <i>Oh, thank God.</i>

06:26.553 --> 06:31.433
- I think this will look good here.

06:34.228 --> 06:35.521
These are pretty good.

06:35.521 --> 06:38.065
- Oh, thanks. Here.
- Mm.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.525
Listen.

06:40.818 --> 06:43.987
Hunter Fosterini is putting
his Bellevue estate on the market.

06:43.987 --> 06:46.198
Wait, CEO of Crypt-Yo?

06:46.198 --> 06:48.826
- He's hired me to stage it.
- Really?

06:48.826 --> 06:50.702
But with the twins coming,

06:50.702 --> 06:53.330
I'm finally promoting you to do it solo.

06:53.330 --> 06:55.332
Oh, my God.
Stacey, are you serious? That...

06:55.332 --> 06:58.043
- Wow, I...
- It's make-or-break.

06:58.043 --> 07:00.295
Yeah. No, I know that.

07:00.295 --> 07:03.966
As one strong woman to you,

07:03.966 --> 07:05.759
don't mess it up.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.302
I... I won't. I will not.

07:07.302 --> 07:08.929
I will... I won't let you down.

07:08.929 --> 07:11.014
Just make him feel good about himself.

07:11.014 --> 07:14.434
Blur the line between stager
and potential sexual partner.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.353
That's how you'll succeed.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.949
Oh. Hi.

07:31.368 --> 07:32.494
Wait, are you somebody's?

07:33.787 --> 07:35.998
Oh, no, no, no. No, no.

07:35.998 --> 07:37.541
No, no, no. I'm sorry.

07:37.541 --> 07:41.044
Sorry, buddy. I've just got to go find
an outfit for my sister to criticize.

07:41.044 --> 07:42.337
But good luck, okay?

07:45.257 --> 07:46.258
Thank you so much

07:46.258 --> 07:47.551
- for coming down and checking us out.
-  Yeah.

07:47.551 --> 07:50.512
You know, these dogs
do deserve a loving home.

07:51.597 --> 07:55.851
And I got the perfect fucking guy for you.
Real beauty.

07:55.851 --> 07:59.188
Just needs some belly rubs
and tolerance training.

07:59.188 --> 08:00.856
- Oh, my...

08:00.856 --> 08:02.649
Oh, don't worry, he'll get bigger.

08:02.649 --> 08:03.775
That's a therapy dog?

08:03.775 --> 08:04.985
Oh, yeah. He's perfect for you.

08:04.985 --> 08:07.154
You're not gonna have
any problems with this guy.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.947
He'll destroy anyone that messes with you.

08:08.947 --> 08:11.241
- Um, I...

08:11.241 --> 08:13.577
I mean, I've seen him go ballistic.

08:13.577 --> 08:16.288
Anyone look him directly in the eye,
they're fucked!

08:16.872 --> 08:18.790
- I don't think this is a good idea.

08:18.790 --> 08:20.500
- What?
- I'm sorry, I just... I don't need a...

08:20.500 --> 08:23.462
Oh, don't worry about it. No problem.
We've got some other dogs.

08:23.462 --> 08:25.547
Hmm. Ah.

08:26.340 --> 08:29.134
What about
this cute little one right here, huh?

08:37.017 --> 08:38.018
What's her name?

08:38.685 --> 08:40.354
Well, it's up to you, my dude.

08:40.354 --> 08:42.606
Just bring her back in a week
to get spayed.

08:43.649 --> 08:45.734
She might be perfect for you.

08:47.319 --> 08:48.862
Yeah, maybe she is.

08:59.790 --> 09:02.834
Sorry, I'm just...
I'm just a little nervous. Uh...

09:06.797 --> 09:10.133
Well, hey, if you wanna change anything,
that's fine. You know?

09:12.052 --> 09:14.304
Just run it by me first, if that's cool.

09:18.850 --> 09:20.811
So what do I call you?

09:21.478 --> 09:24.606
King Charles? Or Queen Charles?

09:29.695 --> 09:31.780
What do you think about, uh, Chloe?

09:36.535 --> 09:39.997
I think I'm gonna call you Chloe,
if that's okay.

09:40.872 --> 09:42.332
Great.

09:42.332 --> 09:44.126
Do you want to do a tour?

09:44.751 --> 09:48.714
Um, I work in IT.
This is my work-from-home station.

09:49.423 --> 09:51.466
Popped for Xfinity,
so my Internet's crazy fast,

09:51.466 --> 09:53.010
like, over a gig.

09:54.720 --> 09:56.054
Trust me, that's really fast.

09:56.054 --> 09:58.473
I mean, I... I could talk about
this shelf all day.

09:58.473 --> 10:01.518
We got an unopened '80s original
right here.

10:01.518 --> 10:03.895
And this whole collection
is just next-level.

10:03.895 --> 10:04.980
Oh, and...

10:04.980 --> 10:09.359
So Brando smoked this
for one take in <i>The Godfather.</i>

10:09.359 --> 10:12.362
I mean, supposedly.
It didn't make the final cut of the film.

10:12.362 --> 10:17.743
But he did smoke a cigar in the poster,
so it's still kind of dope.

10:17.743 --> 10:20.329
This is my keyboard.

10:23.915 --> 10:25.334
That's not bad.

10:26.001 --> 10:27.961
And, you know,
it can be yours, if you want.

10:27.961 --> 10:32.007
I'm... I'm really tired of making music
just for myself, so...

10:32.507 --> 10:35.052
Well... [sighs] ...that's it.

10:36.053 --> 10:37.512
That's me.

10:37.512 --> 10:39.306
It's impressive, right?

10:39.765 --> 10:42.017
Oh, thank you.

10:42.017 --> 10:43.518
That's fine, I guess.

10:45.812 --> 10:46.813
Wow.

10:56.114 --> 10:57.366
Okay.

11:00.410 --> 11:02.871
Mom? Hello?

11:16.718 --> 11:21.264
- Princess, you're looking hypoallergenic.

11:21.264 --> 11:23.016
Nicole?

11:26.353 --> 11:27.979
Hey!

11:28.563 --> 11:31.066
- Shoes.
- Oh.

11:31.066 --> 11:34.027
Shoes, Nicole.
You know we don't wear shoes in the house.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.862
It's good to see you too, Mom.

11:37.656 --> 11:40.075
Hi, Sis. I'm home.

11:40.075 --> 11:41.159
Hi!

11:41.159 --> 11:42.911
- Shoes!
- Hi!

11:42.911 --> 11:45.622
- Okay.
- I don't think we've met yet.

11:45.622 --> 11:46.706
- Oh!
- Hi.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.793
- Nicole, this is Alistair.
-  Hello.

11:49.793 --> 11:53.463
He flew all the way here
to ask Mom for my hand.

11:53.463 --> 11:54.923
-  Well, of course.
- Oh, wow. That...

11:54.923 --> 11:56.758
- I had to come for this.
- Oh.

11:56.758 --> 11:59.428
- Mom, is this your ring?

12:00.262 --> 12:02.806
Well, you're hardly
galloping down the aisle, Nic.

12:05.100 --> 12:07.477
So, how's work going, Nicole?

12:07.477 --> 12:10.939
Uh, oh, really good, actually.

12:10.939 --> 12:15.068
Yeah, Stacey promoted me
to head stager today, I think.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.528
She's killing it.

12:16.528 --> 12:19.614
Number two for Stacey Dorin,
a legend in home staging.

12:19.614 --> 12:20.782
Oh, my God.

12:20.782 --> 12:23.869
Nicole's a very talented artist.
She could have gone to art school.

12:23.869 --> 12:27.372
But instead she chose to spend
her life rearranging furniture.

12:27.372 --> 12:31.918
It's home staging, Mom,
in highest-luxury real estate.

12:31.918 --> 12:34.463
You make it sound like
it's musical chairs.

12:34.463 --> 12:36.673
She turned down a spot at U-Dub
for art and design.

12:36.673 --> 12:39.259
Yeah, well, someone needed
to take care of Dad

12:39.259 --> 12:40.635
while you were in Paris, so...

12:40.635 --> 12:42.929
- See what I mean? Defensiveness.
-  Mm-hmm.

12:42.929 --> 12:45.474
I mean, she's been completely closed off
these last three years.

12:45.474 --> 12:46.558
Curious.

12:46.558 --> 12:48.852
Mom, I'm literally sitting right here.

12:48.852 --> 12:51.104
- I mean, she parties every night.
- Yeah.

12:51.104 --> 12:55.400
But I'm afraid,
deep down, she's really lonely.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.402
- Fascinating.
- Oh, my God, Mom.

12:57.402 --> 13:00.822
Why are you discussing this with Alistair?

13:00.822 --> 13:03.033
Because he's British, Nicole.

13:09.414 --> 13:12.501
Nothing good happens out there
past 9:00 p.m.

13:13.793 --> 13:16.922
Just a bunch of packed bars

13:16.922 --> 13:20.342
and people breathing on each other.

13:20.342 --> 13:22.969
<i>♪ I, I, I can't go now ♪</i>

13:22.969 --> 13:26.640
<i>♪ DJ's playing
my, my, my, my song now ♪</i>

13:26.640 --> 13:29.601
<i>♪ But if you want to wait all night ♪</i>

13:29.601 --> 13:35.190
<i>♪ I just might
go all the way with you tonight ♪</i>

13:35.690 --> 13:38.026
<i>♪ Erase the visual
you like my... ♪</i>

13:38.026 --> 13:39.611
You killed it on the bridge.

13:39.611 --> 13:43.240
Uh, no, you killed it. Oh, my God.

13:46.910 --> 13:50.789
Yeah, there are zero
one-night-standable guys in this bar.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.711
- Oh, my God.

13:59.839 --> 14:02.300
- Seriously?

14:03.927 --> 14:06.638
-  Chloe, what are you...

14:08.014 --> 14:10.767
You need this right now?

14:11.518 --> 14:13.311
Okay, hold on.

14:24.614 --> 14:25.615
Okay.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.034
Hmm.

14:29.953 --> 14:30.954
Oh.

14:31.621 --> 14:33.623
Hi.

14:33.623 --> 14:34.833
Who are you?

14:35.333 --> 14:36.918
Delivery guy.

14:37.836 --> 14:40.922
Well, I'm willing to receive a delivery.

14:43.633 --> 14:45.051
Of a guy.

14:47.387 --> 14:50.307
Pad thai with beef for Rahul.

14:53.018 --> 14:54.519
No, okay.

14:54.519 --> 14:57.063
- Here you go.

14:57.063 --> 14:58.815
- All right.

14:59.774 --> 15:02.068
Have a good night, delivery guy.

15:02.068 --> 15:04.362
- Thank you.
- See ya.

15:04.362 --> 15:06.114
Ugh.

15:12.621 --> 15:14.456
Hey, Chaim.

15:14.456 --> 15:17.083
Oh, I'm sorry. Chaim.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.376
Hello, it's me.

15:18.376 --> 15:22.088
Listen, I just wanted to let you know
that I can let people in.

15:22.088 --> 15:24.507
I actually let so many people in.

15:24.507 --> 15:26.051
Everyone in but you.

15:26.051 --> 15:30.930
And I am capable of love, so thank you.

15:31.473 --> 15:33.099
And good night. Goodbye.

15:33.725 --> 15:35.352
Idiot.

15:35.352 --> 15:36.519
Ugh.

15:39.731 --> 15:42.525
Buddy, you're still here?

15:45.654 --> 15:47.322
Oh, man. No.

15:47.322 --> 15:49.324
Don't look at me like a person.

15:55.080 --> 15:58.708
Okay. All right. Come on.

15:58.708 --> 16:01.044
One-night stand, all right?

16:01.044 --> 16:02.128
Let's go.

16:03.755 --> 16:05.632
Make yourself at home.

16:05.632 --> 16:08.802
Oh, sorry about the mess. Just...

16:11.805 --> 16:14.265
Just gonna make a drink.

16:15.433 --> 16:16.685
Yum, yum, yum, yum.

16:17.310 --> 16:20.855
Oh! No! Ooh, no, no, no. No.

16:20.855 --> 16:23.358
That lo mein is, like, weeks old.

16:23.358 --> 16:24.442
Oh, God.

16:25.402 --> 16:28.446
Is that you or is that the noodles?

16:30.323 --> 16:31.866
Come on, we'll get you washed up.

16:31.866 --> 16:33.952
Come on. Come on, buddy.

16:36.329 --> 16:39.082
Okay, next up,
let's talk conditioner, shall we?

16:39.833 --> 16:42.335
Would you like argan oil to strengthen,

16:42.961 --> 16:45.630
or coconut milk to thicken?

16:46.172 --> 16:47.173
Hmm?

16:51.386 --> 16:52.846
Argan oil?

16:52.846 --> 16:56.808
Yeah. Smart dog. Solid choice.

17:00.770 --> 17:04.566
Done. Okay, let's take a peek. Okay.

17:04.566 --> 17:07.694
One, two, three.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.362
Oh, wow.

17:09.362 --> 17:12.282
Look at you, handsome!

17:12.282 --> 17:13.491
Ooh.

17:13.491 --> 17:16.494
It's like I'm looking at Channing Tatum.

17:16.494 --> 17:18.621
Yeah. There's you.

17:20.290 --> 17:23.418
Chloe, whatever you're doing is loud.
I'm trying to sleep.

17:24.669 --> 17:26.129
Are you trying to dig a hole?

17:28.882 --> 17:30.300
Thank you.

17:40.769 --> 17:44.481
Definitely woken up next to hairier,
that's for sure.

17:46.024 --> 17:47.025
Good morning.

17:47.025 --> 17:50.612
No. No morning-after makeouts.

17:52.363 --> 17:55.909
Okay. All right.

17:55.909 --> 17:57.660
Time to find your person.

18:00.205 --> 18:02.499
- We have 32 pounds.
- Mm.

18:02.499 --> 18:04.000
He's in great shape.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.878
You're a tough guy, aren't you?
You're a real tough guy.

18:06.878 --> 18:09.255
Hey, tough guy, how old are you?
Can you tell me?

18:09.255 --> 18:11.382
"Oh, I'm two years old, yes."

18:11.382 --> 18:12.717
He says he's two years old.

18:12.717 --> 18:14.594
- Isn't that cute? You know what?
- Okay. Adorable.

18:14.594 --> 18:15.762
Here's an odd thing.

18:15.762 --> 18:19.599
I don't see any testicles,
so he's been neutered, but no chip.

18:19.599 --> 18:22.519
- So two snips, zero chips.
- Um...

18:22.519 --> 18:24.729
Did you find him outside of a store
with a sign reading,

18:24.729 --> 18:26.439
-"No chips, no balls, no service"?

18:27.732 --> 18:29.067
- Okay.
- We have fun here.

18:29.067 --> 18:31.194
So what do I do then?
What am I supposed to do?

18:31.194 --> 18:34.906
Well, the first thing you should do
is get him some shots for worms,

18:34.906 --> 18:38.243
because he was a stray,
and that's very common.

18:38.243 --> 18:41.287
And it's also extremely common
for humans to ingest them.

18:41.287 --> 18:43.289
So have you checked your stools yet?

18:43.289 --> 18:45.166
- My stool?
- For worms.

18:45.166 --> 18:46.417
Holy shit. No, I haven't.

18:46.417 --> 18:49.671
And maybe for an old Monopoly piece if
you ever shoved one of those up your butt.

18:49.671 --> 18:51.798
- Jesus Christ. Okay. All right.
-  It happens.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.716
It happens when you're a kid.

18:53.716 --> 18:56.845
All right, well, good luck, pal.

18:56.845 --> 18:58.096
Um, okay, well, the thing is...

18:58.096 --> 18:59.430
He's gonna be
a great dog for you, I think.

18:59.430 --> 19:01.349
The thing is, I just...
I can't have a dog right now.

19:01.349 --> 19:03.101
- I'm really busy. I'm never home.
- You're busy?

19:03.101 --> 19:04.686
Yeah, work, is... It's crazy.

19:04.686 --> 19:06.521
- It's crazy. Yeah. So what do you do?
- Right now, yeah.

19:06.521 --> 19:10.191
Are you like a long-haul trucker,
or you work on an oil rig or neurosurgeon?

19:10.191 --> 19:11.401
- I'm a home stager.
- Ah.

19:11.401 --> 19:14.529
Yeah, for high-end luxury real estate.
It's kind of a big deal, so...

19:14.529 --> 19:17.907
Do you still want her to be your owner?
"Probably not. She seems selfish."

19:17.907 --> 19:20.577
Hey, she's not selfish. She's just busy.

19:20.577 --> 19:22.662
- You don't have to talk through the dog.
- I can't help it. He's very talkative.

19:22.662 --> 19:23.746
Okay.

19:23.746 --> 19:26.457
You know what? That's fine.
Don't worry about it.

19:26.457 --> 19:29.335
Don't adjust your lifestyle
for anything or anybody.

19:29.335 --> 19:30.420
Excuse me?

19:30.420 --> 19:31.921
Sorry. That was an inner thought.

19:31.921 --> 19:35.174
I think you should post on Nextdoor,
maybe put up a few flyers,

19:35.174 --> 19:37.051
and if you don't hear anything,

19:37.051 --> 19:39.470
you know, take him to
an animal shelter, I guess.

19:39.470 --> 19:42.265
- They'll find him a home, right?
- Yeah, probably not.

19:42.265 --> 19:44.434
You might as well get it over with...
put up the flyers,

19:44.434 --> 19:47.228
and then get ready to see this guy
in the dumpster.

19:48.313 --> 19:52.108
Typically I wouldn't be outside
during a pedestrian hour,

19:52.692 --> 19:53.735
or ever,

19:53.735 --> 19:55.987
but it's better you pee out here
than on my floor.

19:55.987 --> 19:58.781
So, just get it done, and then we'll go...

19:58.781 --> 19:59.866
Oh, my God.

20:00.575 --> 20:02.827
- Oh, God. Fuck. No.
-  Hi, friends.

20:02.827 --> 20:05.246
- Chloe, no, no, no, no, no.
-  And who is this?

20:05.246 --> 20:07.665
- Uh, she's...
- Oh, so adorable!

20:07.665 --> 20:09.042
Come here, you. Come here.

20:09.042 --> 20:10.877
- She's, uh, Chloe.
- Come here. Come here.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.670
-  Mm-hmm.
- So adorable.

20:12.670 --> 20:14.047
- Oh. Oh!
- Oh.

20:14.047 --> 20:16.299
- Oh, my God. Yeah.
- Such a sniffer.

20:16.299 --> 20:17.508
- Whoa.
- All right.

20:17.508 --> 20:18.843
Um, could you just...

20:19.344 --> 20:21.804
Okay. Please, um, just... Thank you.

20:21.804 --> 20:24.140
Hey, we should do a playdate.

20:24.140 --> 20:25.433
Oh, um...

20:26.434 --> 20:27.518
Okay, bye.

20:28.519 --> 20:29.812
Come on, Strawberry!

20:29.812 --> 20:31.606
Chloe, never do that again, okay?

20:32.398 --> 20:35.276
Do you hear me?
I was just violated for you.

20:35.276 --> 20:38.446
Your Canva presentation looks pretty dope.

20:38.446 --> 20:39.781
Well, I'm trying.

20:39.948 --> 20:41.950
I really have to impress this guy.

20:41.950 --> 20:44.661
Next, maybe you should make
lost dog posters.

20:44.661 --> 20:46.245
Do you think someone's gonna claim him?

20:46.245 --> 20:49.040
I mean, maybe he's already home.
Your place is a dumpster.

20:49.040 --> 20:51.459
My place is not a dumpster.
It's organized chaos.

20:51.459 --> 20:53.336
- Mm-hmm. Oh. Oh.

20:53.336 --> 20:56.339
- Oh, your dog.
- Hey! Oh! No, no! No, boy.

20:56.339 --> 20:58.633
Oh.

20:58.633 --> 21:02.178
Okay. All right.
Fine, I will take him out.

21:02.178 --> 21:04.263
<i>Looks like you got a girlfriend.</i>

21:04.263 --> 21:06.891
Maybe a little.

21:06.891 --> 21:09.352
Yeah... But no, you know, not really.

21:09.352 --> 21:11.396
<i>Maybe it's time for a real one</i>?

21:11.396 --> 21:13.606
Oh, no. I mean, I don't know.

21:13.606 --> 21:16.317
I... [chuckles] I got a dog, so...

21:16.317 --> 21:18.903
<i>Why? Because you're an ugly loser?</i>

21:18.903 --> 21:20.863
Okay, can we maybe stop
with the mirroring?

21:20.863 --> 21:22.699
It kind of hurts my feelings.

21:22.699 --> 21:25.868
<i>Let's just try going out on a random date.</i>

21:25.868 --> 21:30.415
<i>Think of it as an experiment
in conquering your anxiety.</i>

21:30.415 --> 21:32.166
<i>You never need to see them again.</i>

21:32.166 --> 21:34.877
<i>This is the next step.</i>

21:34.877 --> 21:38.464
<i>Maybe Chloe can help you
with your dating profile.</i>

21:41.384 --> 21:43.302
Back on the prowl.

21:47.223 --> 21:49.392
Ah! Do you approve?

21:49.392 --> 21:51.477
- I'm gonna take that as a yes.

21:51.477 --> 21:54.022
Add new photo.

21:54.689 --> 21:57.692
What do you think? Not bad, right?

21:59.152 --> 22:00.486
Do your magic, Bumble.

22:00.486 --> 22:03.031
Okay. Now we wait.

22:04.157 --> 22:07.035
Nice. Neat.

22:07.035 --> 22:10.038
Reasonably funny.

22:10.913 --> 22:14.876
Currently have a job, at time of posting.

22:16.044 --> 22:18.046
I should put some hobbies.

22:18.629 --> 22:20.965
Figurine aficionado?

22:20.965 --> 22:23.968
How about hanging with my fluffy roommate?

22:25.136 --> 22:26.137
Yeah?

22:27.889 --> 22:29.307
This is stupid.

22:30.308 --> 22:34.771
I just want you to know, if I ever manage
to actually bring home another woman,

22:35.605 --> 22:38.232
it's not gonna change
what we're building together.

22:40.151 --> 22:43.112
No bio. Only an Instagram link.

22:43.905 --> 22:45.740
That's a really deep V-neck.

22:46.699 --> 22:50.119
Why are you posting a group photo?
Which one are you?

22:50.119 --> 22:53.331
Oh, my God.
This guy is literally in prison.

22:56.209 --> 22:57.585
"Reasonably funny."

22:58.836 --> 23:02.757
Okay. Oh, my God. Wow.

23:03.674 --> 23:05.093
Your dog is a ten.

23:06.052 --> 23:07.470
Hey.

23:07.470 --> 23:09.847
I'm gonna swipe right on this one
for you, all right?

23:18.189 --> 23:19.273
Damn.

23:20.566 --> 23:22.485
This girl's out of my league.

23:24.153 --> 23:28.908
But, as a very wise Jedi Master once said,

23:29.659 --> 23:33.746
"Do. Or do not. There is no try."

23:35.164 --> 23:36.249
Yeah.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.712
Look, Chloe, you gotta understand,
this girl's hot,

23:41.712 --> 23:44.674
and I'm kinda odd.

23:46.300 --> 23:48.136
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

23:49.637 --> 23:52.974
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

23:55.351 --> 23:56.978
Oh, my God.

24:00.857 --> 24:02.942
Does this mean I have to
actually meet up with her?

24:02.942 --> 24:04.610
Whoo-hoo.

24:04.610 --> 24:06.320
She's way out of your league, dude.

24:06.320 --> 24:08.990
- Yeah, man, thank you. I know that.
- Well, don't worry about it.

24:08.990 --> 24:11.075
I got a three-step approach
that is guaranteed

24:11.075 --> 24:13.744
to help you score points on any date.

24:13.744 --> 24:16.873
Trust. 'Cause you already know
the ladies I be bringin' in.

24:16.873 --> 24:17.999
No, I don't.

24:17.999 --> 24:20.293
Well, I mean, you heard about
my many stories of conquest.

24:20.293 --> 24:21.627
No. What are you talk...

24:21.627 --> 24:24.213
You're the only person I know from school
other than me that's still single.

24:24.213 --> 24:25.882
Take this down.

24:25.882 --> 24:27.717
- Step one.
- Give me my phone.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.219
You want to get
on the lady's level, right?

24:30.219 --> 24:31.429
Which in your case,

24:31.429 --> 24:33.890
you're gonna have to
bring her down to your level.

24:33.890 --> 24:38.477
So you have to neg her to keep
her vulnerable with, uh, veiled insults.

24:38.477 --> 24:41.063
- That will keep her off guard.
- Insult her.

24:41.063 --> 24:45.526
So you want to say something like,
"Oh, those shoes were hot last season."

24:45.526 --> 24:46.944
I don't know what a season is.

24:46.944 --> 24:48.863
Doesn't matter. She does.

24:48.863 --> 24:51.407
- Step two. Now you broke her down...
- Yeah.

24:51.407 --> 24:53.451
...you want to build her up now.

24:53.451 --> 24:55.036
- Be specific.

24:55.036 --> 24:57.997
Talk about her nail polish
and how that's a great color on her.

24:57.997 --> 25:00.333
- Okay, her nail polish.
- Yeah, she'll love that.

25:00.333 --> 25:02.251
- And then comes the physical part.
- Yeah?

25:02.251 --> 25:03.753
- My favorite.
- Mm-hmm.

25:03.753 --> 25:05.463
- You ready for this? Okay.
- Yeah.

25:07.423 --> 25:08.674
Blow on her neck.

25:08.674 --> 25:10.509
- Just go like this.
- What?

25:10.509 --> 25:12.929
-  That's the secret.
- What?

25:12.929 --> 25:14.013
Yeah. Yeah.

25:14.013 --> 25:16.224
- That's why you're single.
- No.

25:18.226 --> 25:21.145
Wait, wait, wait. Slow down. Slow down.
You should never rush on stairs.

25:23.564 --> 25:26.484
Do you see her anywhere? Kind of forget
what she looks like, to be honest.

25:26.484 --> 25:27.944
Holy shit!

25:27.944 --> 25:29.820
- Hey.

25:29.820 --> 25:31.239
Come on. It's okay.

25:31.948 --> 25:34.408
- What the fuck? Jesus!

25:35.493 --> 25:39.372
Okay, come on. I know. That was insane.

25:40.498 --> 25:43.000
No, hey! Gross! Gross, gross.

25:43.000 --> 25:46.045
We're expecting company. Disgusting.

25:46.212 --> 25:48.422
She's three minutes late.

25:49.757 --> 25:51.008
She's probably not gonna come.

25:53.803 --> 25:55.221
You don't see her, do you?

25:55.972 --> 25:57.139
She's not coming.

25:57.139 --> 25:59.976
Okay, we... we should just go.

25:59.976 --> 26:02.937
- This place is terrify...
- That is Chloe, so you must be Max. Hey.

26:04.146 --> 26:05.606
Hey... lo.

26:05.606 --> 26:08.234
- Hi.

26:08.234 --> 26:10.653
- This must be Channing Tatum.
- Yeah.

26:11.696 --> 26:13.239
"I'm not gonna give up on you."

26:14.448 --> 26:15.449
Wait, what?

26:15.449 --> 26:19.245
- It's, uh, <i>G.I. Joe</i>: Rise of the Cobra.
- Right, right.

26:19.245 --> 26:22.790
Yeah, well, I think he's more of
a <i>Magic Mike</i> kind of Channing.

26:22.790 --> 26:25.167
"Do I look like I own tights?"

26:27.670 --> 26:29.213
- Uh, yeah.
- That might be <i>Step Up.</i>

26:29.213 --> 26:31.507
Yeah, I think that is <i>Step</i>...
I don't know.

26:31.507 --> 26:33.217
Movie confusion. Doesn't matter. Um. so...

26:33.217 --> 26:34.302
Cool shirt.

26:34.302 --> 26:36.178
Oh, this... Thanks. It's a band.

26:38.097 --> 26:39.849
Your boots.

26:40.558 --> 26:42.226
- My boo...
- Your boots.

26:42.226 --> 26:45.229
Oh. Oh, yeah. Yeah. They're whatever.

26:45.229 --> 26:46.772
They're really, uh... really cool.

26:46.772 --> 26:49.400
Um, just, like, uh,

26:50.276 --> 26:52.695
- last season maybe?
- Oh.

26:52.695 --> 26:56.073
Yeah, probably.
I got them at a vintage store, so...

26:56.073 --> 26:57.158
Oh.

26:57.825 --> 27:00.536
Nail polish. That's a really nice color.

27:03.873 --> 27:06.625
- You are "reasonably funny."

27:10.546 --> 27:11.881
- Um, anyway, shall we...

27:11.881 --> 27:12.965
Mm-hmm.

27:12.965 --> 27:14.842
Ooh. Hold on.

27:19.638 --> 27:21.182
Well, they seem to be
getting along nicely.

27:21.182 --> 27:22.558
- Yeah.
- That's cute.

27:24.101 --> 27:25.770
He's had all his shots, right?

27:25.770 --> 27:29.190
No, no. It's all a government conspiracy.

27:29.190 --> 27:30.441
What?

27:31.275 --> 27:32.902
- I'm kidding.
-  Oh.

27:32.902 --> 27:35.237
Of course he's had his shots.

27:37.823 --> 27:39.867
- Uh, hey, are you hungry?
- Uh...

27:39.867 --> 27:43.120
No, it's the best chicken I've ever had.
Just trust me.

27:43.120 --> 27:45.081
- Oh, actually, I don't...
- No, no, no.

27:45.081 --> 27:46.957
Just watch the dogs.
I will be right back. Hold on.

27:46.957 --> 27:48.125
Check the health rating.

27:48.125 --> 27:51.087
Less than an A
means potential for contamination.

27:52.171 --> 27:54.215
- What?
- Make sure it's...

27:54.215 --> 27:55.466
- Yeah.
- Okay.

27:55.466 --> 27:59.261
Two dogs. Two dogs.

27:59.261 --> 28:00.930
I don't even know this other dog.

28:02.056 --> 28:04.308
Okay, yeah, don't touch the bench yet.
Hold on.

28:05.643 --> 28:07.686
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

28:10.940 --> 28:12.858
- Okay.
- Hi.

28:14.318 --> 28:16.570
- Just move that.
- Oh, okay, well, I was... Okay.

28:16.570 --> 28:20.157
All right, so, rule number one... do not
touch your eyes or you will go blind.

28:20.157 --> 28:21.784
- I'm serious.
- Why?

28:21.784 --> 28:23.744
It's ghost pepper.
You've never had it before?

28:23.744 --> 28:25.788
- No.
- Oh!

28:25.788 --> 28:29.542
Uh, rule number, uh, two...
sanitize hands.

28:29.542 --> 28:32.086
- Oh. Yeah, sure.
- Yeah, I got you.

28:32.086 --> 28:35.256
- Little bit of...
- Okay.

28:36.340 --> 28:38.217
All right. Here we go.

28:38.217 --> 28:41.011
Rule number three...
maybe we just, like, feed ourselves.

28:41.011 --> 28:42.138
Can you just try the chicken?

28:42.138 --> 28:44.181
I just don't really, like,
dabble with hot stuff.

28:44.181 --> 28:45.266
- My stomach...
- Yeah, okay.

28:45.266 --> 28:47.017
- Sometimes you just gotta try stuff.
- Okay. All right.

28:48.519 --> 28:51.355
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, that's so spicy.

28:53.566 --> 28:55.526
My God, that's spicy.

28:55.526 --> 28:57.486
- Are...

28:57.486 --> 29:01.449
Oh, my God. Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Here. Here.

29:02.575 --> 29:03.742
- Really?
- Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

29:03.742 --> 29:07.246
-  Here. Here, just...

29:08.205 --> 29:09.832
- Okay.

29:11.542 --> 29:14.378
-  Wow.
-  Why do people eat this?

29:14.378 --> 29:15.671
Okay, reveal.

29:15.671 --> 29:17.715
Super spicy chicken,
it's a natural truth serum.

29:17.715 --> 29:19.717
- It's really fun, right?
- Mm. Super fun.

29:19.717 --> 29:21.385
Well, let's get to know
each other a little.

29:21.385 --> 29:23.137
- Okay, first question.
- Oh, my God.

29:23.137 --> 29:25.806
What did you keep
in your high school locker?

29:25.806 --> 29:27.224
- I don't remember. It was a long time ago.
- Yes, you go.

29:27.224 --> 29:28.309
- No. Yes, you do.

29:28.309 --> 29:30.561
What'd you keep in there, like,
all the way in the back?

29:30.561 --> 29:32.188
Magic cards.

29:32.188 --> 29:34.940
- You were a nerd. I knew it.
- Nothing wrong with being a nerd.

29:34.940 --> 29:36.025
And it's not like--
I didn't play with them.

29:36.025 --> 29:37.109
Liar.

29:37.109 --> 29:38.819
- Eat another wing.
- Okay.

29:38.819 --> 29:41.906
- Okay. Okay, okay, okay.
-  Okay, okay.

29:44.283 --> 29:47.328
- Okay, it's my turn to ask.

29:47.953 --> 29:49.413
Okay, uh...

29:50.414 --> 29:53.125
Okay. Oh...
Wait, you prepared questions?

29:54.460 --> 29:56.212
Yeah, I thought it...

29:56.212 --> 29:57.796
What, uh...

29:57.796 --> 29:59.548
What's one of
your favorite family memories?

29:59.548 --> 30:01.091
- Um...

30:01.091 --> 30:03.010
Like, Christmas, I guess.

30:03.802 --> 30:05.971
Well, you have to give me
more than just, like, Christmas.

30:05.971 --> 30:07.515
That's all I got. I'm gonna pass.

30:07.515 --> 30:09.517
- You can't pass. Pass?
- That's kind of a boring question anyway.

30:09.517 --> 30:12.311
- Yeah, I'm gonna pass.
- What's your favorite family memory?

30:12.311 --> 30:14.438
- I said I'm gonna pass.
- You can't change the rules.

30:14.438 --> 30:17.858
Well, I made up the rules, so I kind of...
I can change them.

30:20.194 --> 30:21.278
I just feel like rules are there
to be followed.

30:21.278 --> 30:23.197
- So what's the point in making them?
- Can you just let it go?

30:29.245 --> 30:30.788
Wait, where are the dogs?

30:31.539 --> 30:32.540
Uh-oh.

30:32.540 --> 30:34.124
- Channing?
- Chloe?

30:34.625 --> 30:37.044
- I'm sure they're close by.
- Chloe?

30:37.044 --> 30:39.213
- Channing?
- Chloe!

30:39.213 --> 30:40.589
-  Channing?
-  Chloe?

30:41.674 --> 30:43.300
- Channing?
- Chloe?

30:45.427 --> 30:46.637
Chloe!

30:46.637 --> 30:48.681
- Chann... [groans] Shit.
- Chloe!

30:48.681 --> 30:50.224
- Channing?
- Do you see either of them?

30:50.224 --> 30:51.684
- I think...
- Chloe!

30:51.684 --> 30:53.978
Look.

30:55.437 --> 30:57.606
-  Channing? Channing?
-  Chloe?

30:57.606 --> 30:59.483
Chloe? Oh, my God!

30:59.483 --> 31:01.485
-  What?
- Get away from her, you monster!

31:01.485 --> 31:04.446
Hey, it's fine. He's neutered.
They're just having fun.

31:04.446 --> 31:05.531
- Fun?
- Come on!

31:05.531 --> 31:08.450
How do we know she gave consent?
It's assault.

31:08.450 --> 31:10.911
Hey, it's okay. Calm down.

31:10.911 --> 31:12.621
It's not...

31:12.621 --> 31:14.873
She looked like
she's having a good time.

31:14.873 --> 31:17.585
- Oh, my God.

31:17.585 --> 31:20.588
- Are you okay?
- Do you vomit when you're okay?

31:20.588 --> 31:23.215
No, I mean, I just, I feel bad.
Like, do you need anything?

31:23.215 --> 31:24.550
Yeah, you should feel bad.
This is your fault!

31:24.550 --> 31:26.343
This is all
because of your stupid chicken game!

31:26.343 --> 31:28.095
Oh, my... I'm sorry.

31:28.095 --> 31:29.555
Listen, I was just trying
to have some fun.

31:29.555 --> 31:31.056
- Oh, my...
- I was trying to get to know you.

31:31.056 --> 31:34.727
So you think burning your throat
on lethally spicy chicken is fun?

31:34.727 --> 31:37.146
Really fun! Psycho!

31:37.146 --> 31:38.981
- It's truth serum!
- It's truth serum!

31:38.981 --> 31:41.191
You know what? I thought you were sweet,
if a bit weird.

31:41.191 --> 31:42.526
But you know what? You're a dick!

31:42.526 --> 31:44.486
- Whatever.
- Lose my number. Quick.

31:44.486 --> 31:46.280
Okay, gone, deleted it.

31:47.489 --> 31:50.242
- Oh, my God. No fuckin' way.

31:53.245 --> 31:55.831
What are you whining about?
At least you got laid.

31:56.790 --> 31:58.751
- Oh, hey, you...
-  Holy shit.

31:58.751 --> 32:01.712
- Hey, do you know where the bathroom is?
-  Over there.

32:01.712 --> 32:03.005
- That way? Jesus.
- Yeah.

32:03.005 --> 32:04.423
- Where? How far?
- Just keep going north.

32:04.423 --> 32:05.633
- Is it far?
- It's a good walk.

32:05.633 --> 32:06.925
- It's far?
- Straight that way.

32:07.676 --> 32:08.927
Fuck.

32:12.222 --> 32:15.017
I can't believe this is happening to me.

32:17.478 --> 32:19.813
Dear God.

32:20.856 --> 32:22.358
I can't believe I'm doing this.

32:22.358 --> 32:26.028
Oh, my fucking God. Jesus.

32:26.028 --> 32:28.238
Oh, my God. This...
Okay, it's happening. It's happening.

32:28.238 --> 32:32.618
It's happening. No! Fuck! Oh, my... Fuck.
Are you fucking kidding?

32:32.618 --> 32:34.953
- I'm so sorry, Chloe. We gotta go.

32:36.205 --> 32:37.539
Oh, I'm so sorry.

32:40.668 --> 32:42.252
We are never dating again.

32:44.004 --> 32:45.923
Holy crap.

32:53.681 --> 32:55.683
I literally...

33:03.357 --> 33:06.026
Okay, buddy,
let's get the hell out of here.

33:08.445 --> 33:11.448
Chloe, look what I got.

33:12.449 --> 33:14.868
What do you think? Yeah, check it out.
Check it out.

33:19.707 --> 33:22.334
Yes, this is where you can dig your hole.

33:22.334 --> 33:23.669
Knock yourself out.

33:26.505 --> 33:27.506
Okay.

33:29.174 --> 33:31.009
Okay, Channing. Come here.

33:31.009 --> 33:33.929
Come on. Good boy. Good boy.

33:41.270 --> 33:42.730
It's a little fish.

33:45.107 --> 33:46.775
- Yeah. Good, huh?

33:46.775 --> 33:48.318
That's yours. It's for you.

34:32.029 --> 34:35.449
I should have invested in Crypt-Yo stock
when it was cheap.

34:37.367 --> 34:39.745
Holy shit.

34:41.497 --> 34:43.123
Oh, my God.

34:43.832 --> 34:45.292
What is that?

34:51.340 --> 34:53.634
Wait, is this a room just for a tub?

34:53.634 --> 34:55.719
Wow.

34:59.223 --> 35:00.516
Fuck it.

35:01.767 --> 35:04.394
Oh, God. Ooh.

35:05.145 --> 35:07.898
Yep. Yes. This fits just right.

35:07.898 --> 35:10.025
-  Ding dong!
- Shit.

35:11.777 --> 35:13.278
You must be Nicole.

35:14.863 --> 35:16.114
Hey.

35:16.990 --> 35:19.117
Hi, I'm Nicole. Hi.

35:19.910 --> 35:21.370
Um... Oops.

35:21.370 --> 35:22.830
I was just, uh,

35:23.664 --> 35:25.666
really getting a feel for the space.

35:25.666 --> 35:28.794
Cool, cool. Do your thing.
I respect your process.

35:28.794 --> 35:30.170
Just wanted to say,

35:30.838 --> 35:31.839
yo.

35:32.798 --> 35:33.799
Yo.

35:33.799 --> 35:35.008
I'm Hunter.

35:35.008 --> 35:37.427
Oh, yeah. I... I figured.

35:38.637 --> 35:41.306
- Want to take a bath?
- No, no. I'm good. I'll get out.

35:41.306 --> 35:42.975
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

35:42.975 --> 35:45.894
Because I call this a room for a bath.

35:46.770 --> 35:48.480
Right. Of course.

35:48.480 --> 35:51.191
- Did you want to see the rest?
- Yes. Please.

35:51.775 --> 35:53.569
I show you the world.

35:55.445 --> 35:57.239
This is room for cook.

36:01.326 --> 36:06.123
So, yeah, that is what I'm thinking.

36:06.123 --> 36:08.834
I gotta say, I am vibing this.

36:08.834 --> 36:10.085
Hard.

36:10.085 --> 36:11.962
- Yeah?
- Yeet!

36:11.962 --> 36:17.843
It's the Dalai Lama meets Wayne Manor.
But, like, in an authentic way.

36:18.677 --> 36:22.055
That... That is exactly
what I was going for.

36:22.055 --> 36:25.517
Hey, there's this restaurant downtown
I'm thinking of investing in.

36:25.517 --> 36:27.769
It's completely inspired by ASMR.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.731
You will eat with all your, uh, senses.

36:31.315 --> 36:34.985
I'd, uh... I'd love to take you there,
get your feel on the flow.

36:36.486 --> 36:37.738
Oh, wow.

36:38.488 --> 36:41.992
Yes, I... I'm flattered.

36:41.992 --> 36:45.329
It's the ultimate sensory experience.
It's rad.

36:45.996 --> 36:49.499
Yeah. Um... It sounds rad.

36:52.336 --> 36:54.379
Hey, what's going on, girl?

36:55.297 --> 36:58.300
Yesterday you were throwing up.
Now you want seconds?

37:01.386 --> 37:03.680
Okay, I'm... I'm sorry,
we gotta get ready.

37:03.680 --> 37:08.268
It's time to meet Grandma and Grandpa.
And try not to judge me.

37:08.936 --> 37:10.354
We can't choose our parents.

37:11.897 --> 37:12.940
Okay, here we are.

37:12.940 --> 37:15.442
- This is the place.

37:15.442 --> 37:17.027
Holy shit.

37:20.030 --> 37:23.992
I can't believe you're here, Max.

37:23.992 --> 37:26.286
- Here, sweetie, have a cracker.
- Oh, no, thanks.

37:26.286 --> 37:28.830
- There you go.
- Thank you.

37:28.830 --> 37:31.500
I love what you've done with the place.

37:31.500 --> 37:34.461
- It's always a work in progress, yeah.
- Mm.

37:34.461 --> 37:38.298
- Did you see the wind man out front?
- Uh-huh. Yeah, he... he's cool.

37:38.298 --> 37:40.425
Max, you seem happy.

37:40.425 --> 37:42.803
Yeah. Yeah, I am. I'm...

37:42.803 --> 37:48.350
I mean, Chloe's been helping a lot.
You know, she's pretty special.

37:48.350 --> 37:49.893
Yeah, she's a real beauty, Son.

37:49.893 --> 37:52.771
She's got a little meat on her bones too.
Like her grandma.

37:52.771 --> 37:54.022
-  Stop.

37:54.022 --> 37:56.566
Is she looking kind of heavy? It's weird.

37:56.566 --> 37:59.027
I mean, at first she couldn't keep
any food down,

37:59.027 --> 38:00.320
and lately she can't get enough.

38:00.320 --> 38:04.992
Well, let me take a look at her.
Here, come to Mama, you sweet girl, yeah.

38:04.992 --> 38:08.078
- Look at you. You're just so pretty.

38:09.538 --> 38:11.248
- Honey?
- Hmm?

38:11.248 --> 38:12.499
Could she be pregnant?

38:12.499 --> 38:15.919
No. No, that's impossible.

38:15.919 --> 38:17.587
So she's been spayed?

38:23.343 --> 38:24.928
No fucking way.

38:26.930 --> 38:29.349
All right, pick her up
and place her over the bowl,

38:29.349 --> 38:32.394
but, like,
in her normal squatting position.

38:32.394 --> 38:34.646
I don't think this is how we do it, man.

38:34.646 --> 38:37.733
It is.
I read this is how they do it in Finland.

38:37.733 --> 38:39.526
Finland? What?

38:39.526 --> 38:40.902
Yes. I read, okay?

38:40.902 --> 38:43.113
Don't be uncultured, Max.
It's unattractive.

38:43.113 --> 38:44.906
You're the one who dragged me
to a drugstore bathroom

38:44.906 --> 38:47.951
to stick a piece of plastic
under my dog's vag... I can't even say it.

38:47.951 --> 38:50.203
Look, I'm trying to help you with
your <i>16 and Pregnant</i>-ass dog, okay?

38:50.203 --> 38:51.288
I'm sorry.

38:51.288 --> 38:53.749
You could learn something from her.
Gettin' laid on the first date.

38:53.749 --> 38:55.709
Can you not be so disrespectful?

38:55.709 --> 38:57.502
I swear I get stupider
just being around you.

38:57.502 --> 39:00.422
Hold on, I feel her muscles moving.
I think she's gonna...

39:01.256 --> 39:03.425
- Oh. Oh, that's vile!

39:03.425 --> 39:05.594
- Whew.
- It's okay. It's okay, Chloe.

39:05.594 --> 39:08.263
- She's probably just nervous.
- It's lingering!

39:08.263 --> 39:09.514
- It's okay, Chloe.
- It's lingering, dude.

39:09.514 --> 39:11.391
- Hold on.

39:11.391 --> 39:13.769
- Okay.
- Oh, she's weeing. She's weeing.

39:13.769 --> 39:15.228
- Oh, she's weeing. She's weeing.
- Oh, thank God.

39:15.228 --> 39:16.313
She's weeing. She's weeing.

39:16.313 --> 39:18.356
-  It's on my finger.
- Did it get on the thing?

39:18.356 --> 39:19.941
It did. Ugh!

39:19.941 --> 39:21.234
- Okay.
- Here, girl.

39:21.234 --> 39:24.613
- I'm sorry.
- Okay, all right.

39:24.613 --> 39:26.406
- What?
- I got good news and bad news.

39:26.406 --> 39:28.408
Well, what's the bad news?

39:28.408 --> 39:31.328
It's the same news either way.
It's inconclusive.

39:31.328 --> 39:32.621
That's just no news.

39:32.621 --> 39:33.789
So what do we do now?

39:34.748 --> 39:37.084
- You know.
-  I don't know.

39:37.084 --> 39:38.835
If plan A didn't work...

39:40.462 --> 39:43.256
- Hey, can you go up there?
- No man, this is your dog. You got it.

39:43.256 --> 39:45.050
I'm too anxious, man.
I'm anxious being in here.

39:45.050 --> 39:47.052
Come on, man. Think about it
as a growing experience, you know?

39:47.052 --> 39:48.970
Adding to your progress.
You got this. Here we go.

39:48.970 --> 39:50.055
- Hi.
- Hello.

39:50.055 --> 39:51.264
Hi there. How can I help you?

39:51.932 --> 39:53.600
Um...

39:53.600 --> 39:55.393
Do you sell the, um...

39:56.103 --> 39:57.896
...the Plan B pill here?

39:57.896 --> 39:59.022
Yes, we do.

39:59.022 --> 40:00.273
- Um...
- You do.

40:00.273 --> 40:02.025
I mean, we generally
do a short consultation

40:02.025 --> 40:04.694
with the patient
who we'll be prescribing it to.

40:05.570 --> 40:06.905
Oh, okay.

40:06.905 --> 40:08.156
Um,

40:08.156 --> 40:10.200
I mean, she's... she's right here.

40:10.784 --> 40:13.036
What kind of, uh... Yeah, she's...

40:14.037 --> 40:15.372
Uh...

40:16.289 --> 40:18.250
He got the bitch pregnant.

40:19.835 --> 40:21.002
Oh, yeah.

40:21.002 --> 40:23.839
You're the two morons who got
the pregnancy test for your dog.

40:23.839 --> 40:25.549
Yeah. They've been laughing at you
in the back for the last ten minutes.

40:25.549 --> 40:26.883
- Is that not...
-  Okay.

40:26.883 --> 40:29.219
Do you know how inaccessible
this kind of health care is

40:29.219 --> 40:31.096
to most people across America?

40:31.096 --> 40:32.389
And you want me
to just hand it over to you

40:32.389 --> 40:34.599
so you can put it in a piece of cheese.

40:35.851 --> 40:37.644
- Um...
- Maybe smear some peanut butter on it.

40:37.644 --> 40:38.770
I wasn't gonna wrap it in...

40:38.770 --> 40:41.606
- I hadn't really thought that far.
- Put it in a Beggin' Strip, you know?

40:41.606 --> 40:43.400
- No. No.
- No? Yeah?

40:43.400 --> 40:45.110
What was the plan?

40:45.110 --> 40:46.653
Was this the plan?
This was the whole plan?

40:46.653 --> 40:50.073
You were gonna come in, swing hard
on the "it's for a dog" angle.

40:50.073 --> 40:54.035
Not even broach a lie
that it's for a human woman.

40:54.035 --> 40:57.914
And I was gonna be like,
"Yeah, guys. Let's do it."

40:58.707 --> 40:59.708
Uh...

40:59.708 --> 41:01.334
- We'd hoped.
-  Yeah?

41:01.334 --> 41:03.044
Why don't we just go snort
some fuckin' Adderall?

41:03.044 --> 41:06.298
'Cause apparently I can just grab some
stuff off the shelf and give it to anyone.

41:06.298 --> 41:09.759
Okay, I have one solution I can offer you.

41:09.759 --> 41:11.136
We'll go around back,

41:11.136 --> 41:14.890
and I'll give your fuckin' pug
a back-alley abortion or whatever.

41:14.890 --> 41:16.600
- Can you do that?
- No, I can't fucking do that!

41:16.600 --> 41:18.185
- She can't do that!
- Right. Yes, okay.

41:18.185 --> 41:22.731
I can't do that because I'm not a vet.
You need to go to a vet.

41:22.731 --> 41:25.692
Vets are really expensive,
and I could lose my job any day now.

41:25.692 --> 41:27.027
I'm his boss.

41:27.027 --> 41:29.571
That's terrifying. I hope you don't work
in anything important.

41:29.571 --> 41:31.615
He's spending a lot of his money
on that psychoanalyst.

41:31.615 --> 41:33.074
It's a therapist, man.
Can we not...

41:33.074 --> 41:36.036
- I absolutely don't care about this.
- Just letting her know.

41:36.036 --> 41:37.579
- You need to go to a vet.
-  Yep.

41:37.579 --> 41:39.247
And if you can't afford that,

41:39.247 --> 41:41.458
you need to get in touch with
the owner of the father.

41:42.042 --> 41:43.168
- Ah!

41:43.168 --> 41:46.421
- She talkin' about Channing Tatum's mom.
- What the fuck planet do you guys live on?

41:46.421 --> 41:49.507
- It doesn't matter. It's... It...
- The mom to the doggy.

41:49.507 --> 41:51.551
Come here. Come here.

41:51.551 --> 41:53.553
Now... get the fuck out of my face.

41:53.553 --> 41:54.638
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

41:56.848 --> 41:57.891
It's a stupid fuckin' idea.

41:57.891 --> 41:59.726
- I think you gotta call that girl, Nicole.
- That's not happening.

42:00.477 --> 42:03.897
Prepare to experience food
with all your senses.

42:04.564 --> 42:05.982
It's really nice.

42:05.982 --> 42:09.319
Yes, it makes you question reality.

42:15.158 --> 42:16.576
Soup.

42:18.995 --> 42:20.205
Oh, excuse me, do you have a...

42:23.750 --> 42:27.462
Ah! It is now time to enjoy
the sense of touch.

42:27.462 --> 42:28.755
Okay.

42:31.132 --> 42:34.636
Shit, that's really hot.

42:35.136 --> 42:36.513
It's delicious.

42:37.597 --> 42:40.809
The next course is, uh, smell.

42:46.189 --> 42:47.440
Whoo!

42:48.733 --> 42:49.859
Delicious.

42:50.694 --> 42:52.028
Delicious.

42:53.738 --> 42:55.448
- Oh!

42:55.448 --> 42:56.574
Ooh.

42:57.117 --> 42:59.119
- Mmm.

42:59.119 --> 43:03.123
It's salty.
It's bready. It's tasty.

43:05.667 --> 43:08.086
-<i>Delizioso.</i>

43:08.086 --> 43:09.254
Yeah.

43:10.880 --> 43:13.633
Hey, are you not vibing this?

43:15.176 --> 43:16.303
Do you want to get some real food?

43:16.303 --> 43:17.762
Yes. Yes, I do.

43:17.762 --> 43:19.639
- Well, let's get out of here, huh?
- Oh, okay.

43:19.639 --> 43:22.017
- Two-piece chicken. You bet.
- Thank you.

43:22.017 --> 43:23.977
Thanks for being, uh, cool with this.

43:23.977 --> 43:26.479
Are you kidding me? I love food trucks.

43:26.479 --> 43:27.564
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

43:27.564 --> 43:30.775
There's something about
their transient nature.

43:31.609 --> 43:33.403
You gotta enjoy it while it's here.

43:35.655 --> 43:37.073
That's almost sorta deep.

43:37.073 --> 43:39.951
I'm very deep. Like infinity pool.

43:40.535 --> 43:41.870
- Mm.

43:42.871 --> 43:45.081
I'm so sorry.
This number keeps calling me.

43:45.665 --> 43:47.375
Why can't people just do
normal phone calls?

43:48.084 --> 43:50.920
Um, this might be an emergency.
Could you just hold on?

43:50.920 --> 43:52.797
- Oh, my God...

43:52.797 --> 43:55.425
-<i>Hey. So, um...</i>
- Um, yeah, I'll just be right back.

43:55.425 --> 43:58.178
What the fuck? I said lose my number.

43:58.178 --> 44:03.433
<i>Well, I can't when you're gonna be
a grandmother.</i>

44:03.433 --> 44:05.810
What are you talking about,
you psychopath?

44:06.519 --> 44:09.314
W... Wait a sec... No. No way.
That's not even possible.

44:09.314 --> 44:11.983
<i>No, it's possible.
It's possible because it's happening.</i>

44:11.983 --> 44:15.320
<i>That's what's happening right now.
It's happening now, so it's possible.</i>

44:15.320 --> 44:17.655
Okay, well,
Channing Tatum is not the father.

44:17.655 --> 44:19.157
Well, Chloe hasn't been sleeping around.

44:19.157 --> 44:21.409
<i>Really? Well, she seemed kind of
free with herself at the park.</i>

44:21.409 --> 44:23.870
<i>Hold on. I'm sorry.
Are you slut-shaming my dog?</i>

44:23.870 --> 44:27.165
Listen to me.
Channing does not even have balls, okay?

44:27.165 --> 44:29.751
<i>Hold on... What do you...
How do you know that?</i>

44:30.335 --> 44:33.922
I think I would have noticed his balls.
And the vet checked, okay? He's neutered.

44:33.922 --> 44:36.132
- Okay, well, he has a penis.
-<i>What?</i>

44:36.132 --> 44:39.803
Yes, of course he has a penis,
but you need balls for the penis...

44:42.639 --> 44:44.599
- I can't do this right now.
-<i>Oh, you can't do this?</i>

44:44.599 --> 44:46.184
Wait, how come Chloe wasn't spayed?

44:46.184 --> 44:48.353
<i>Yeah, well, she was gonna be.
She was about to be.</i>

44:48.353 --> 44:52.107
<i>I was gonna take her to an appointment,
and then your mutt mounted her.</i>

44:52.107 --> 44:54.442
- Oh, who are you calling a mutt?
-<i>I'm calling your mutt a mutt.</i>

44:54.442 --> 44:56.569
Yeah, well, it's better a mutt
than a slut!

44:57.654 --> 45:01.074
Wow.

45:01.699 --> 45:03.284
Oh, my God.

45:04.702 --> 45:06.287
I am so sorry about that.

45:06.287 --> 45:09.374
Chill, chill, chill, chill, chill.
No worries.

45:09.374 --> 45:11.418
- So you were saying that...
- I got an early sound bath,

45:11.418 --> 45:13.545
so I should call it.

45:13.545 --> 45:16.423
- Thanks for hanging.
- Okay. Um...

45:17.173 --> 45:19.426
Let's get down to work tomorrow.

45:25.849 --> 45:28.435
Okay, these puppies better not be yours.

45:30.228 --> 45:31.229
Come on.

45:32.730 --> 45:36.317
...or a Monopoly piece up your butt.
It happens when you're a kid.

45:36.317 --> 45:38.528
- Uh-oh, look who's here.
- Hey.

45:38.528 --> 45:40.738
I smell a vape pen.

45:40.738 --> 45:42.824
- You guys ready to solve a mystery?
-  Mm.

45:42.824 --> 45:44.284
It's like <i>Scooby-Doo.</i>

45:44.284 --> 45:46.035
I'll be Fred, you can be Daphne or Velma,

45:46.035 --> 45:49.622
and you can be a young Abraham Lincoln,
'cause that's what you look like.

45:49.622 --> 45:51.166
So how did you two meet?

45:51.166 --> 45:52.834
- God. Please, just no.
- Can we not do this?

45:52.834 --> 45:54.294
Okay. Really none of my business.

45:54.294 --> 45:57.046
But I just have to say,
I sense some sexual tension.

45:57.046 --> 45:58.590
- You're mistaken.
- Mm.

45:58.590 --> 46:00.383
Not between you. The dogs.

46:01.468 --> 46:02.552
You know what?

46:02.552 --> 46:06.973
I think that Chloe does feel
a little thicc, with two C's.

46:06.973 --> 46:08.099
I know the lingo.

46:08.099 --> 46:10.685
Tell you what, let's get
old Channing Tatum up on the table

46:10.685 --> 46:12.896
and we'll see
if this is even possible, huh?

46:12.896 --> 46:14.147
Yeah, let's.

46:14.147 --> 46:16.107
- Chloe, come here.
-  Come on. Okay.

46:16.107 --> 46:18.610
Come on up, pal. There ya go.

46:18.610 --> 46:21.196
Ooh. Well, I'm glad you didn't kill him.
There you go.

46:21.196 --> 46:22.864
- You were gonna kill the dog?
-  How you been?

46:22.864 --> 46:25.158
- No, just shut up.
- Should we find out what's going on?

46:25.158 --> 46:27.285
- What's that?
- Well, that's his penis.

46:27.285 --> 46:29.537
And that's a great penis.
It's a really, really good one.

46:29.537 --> 46:30.622
Not that, the...

46:30.622 --> 46:32.999
Yeah, the ball...
the ball circle things right there.

46:32.999 --> 46:34.542
- Yeah, the ball things.
- What are those?

46:34.542 --> 46:37.212
Oh, fuck me. He's cryptorchid.

46:37.212 --> 46:39.297
- What does that mean?
- In English, please. What does that...

46:39.297 --> 46:41.549
It means that he has
two functioning testicles.

46:41.549 --> 46:43.593
They just never dropped from his abdomen.

46:43.593 --> 46:45.595
- What? That's possible?
- Yeah, it's possible.

46:45.595 --> 46:48.348
Well, good for you!
You're shooting live rounds, buddy!

46:48.348 --> 46:50.308
-  All right.
- Okay.

46:50.308 --> 46:52.894
Are you ready for the next segment
of <i>The Maury Povich Show</i>?

46:52.894 --> 46:55.188
- Please stop.
- Come on, Chloe, you're next.

46:55.188 --> 46:56.272
Okay.

46:57.899 --> 47:01.819
I'd say it's about T-minus 45 days
until showtime.

47:03.655 --> 47:05.448
You two are gonna be grandparents.

47:10.703 --> 47:11.704
Oh.

47:12.372 --> 47:13.790
Come on, Channing.

47:16.918 --> 47:21.047
Now, if you want a copy
of the ultrasound, it's just $49.95.

47:21.047 --> 47:25.176
And then she just storms out.
I mean, she's an awful human. 750 bucks!

47:25.176 --> 47:26.636
Thank God you currently have a job.

47:26.636 --> 47:29.180
I'm sure I can be
a single grandfather, right?

47:29.180 --> 47:31.099
I'm good with one dog. I can handle five.

47:31.099 --> 47:33.226
Don't worry. I'll be your godfather.

47:33.226 --> 47:37.480
May your first puppies
be masculine puppies.

47:37.480 --> 47:39.065
I'm so fuckin' screwed.

47:46.072 --> 47:51.077
I haven't really written anything
in a while, um,

47:52.412 --> 47:53.913
but you've kind of inspired me,

47:53.913 --> 47:57.041
so I thought maybe
I'd try to write you a little...

47:59.252 --> 48:02.922
<i>♪ Chloe, little spaniel ♪</i>

48:03.715 --> 48:06.259

48:15.893 --> 48:17.353

48:34.579 --> 48:36.122
What do you think?

48:38.374 --> 48:39.500
I'm sorry.

48:40.710 --> 48:42.170
<i>Does he look sad to you</i>?

48:43.338 --> 48:45.381
I hate that he misses that hussy.

48:45.381 --> 48:47.050
Dude, maybe he's bummed

48:47.050 --> 48:49.719
because you've basically robbed him
of the chance to be a father.

48:50.345 --> 48:54.557
You're like single-handedly perpetuating
the stereotype of deadbeat dads.

48:54.557 --> 48:58.019
Okay, what am I supposed to do?
Max is a complete lunatic.

48:58.019 --> 49:00.855
Well, you're just mad
because you kind of liked him,

49:00.855 --> 49:02.231
and he wasn't into you.

49:02.231 --> 49:03.941
Oh, no. [scoffs] Please.

49:03.941 --> 49:07.904
Okay, the guy disinfected a park bench
for, like, five minutes,

49:07.904 --> 49:09.072
like a serial killer.

49:09.072 --> 49:10.865
Are you really gonna punish your dog

49:10.865 --> 49:12.867
<i>because the owner of his baby mama
rejected you?</i>

49:16.454 --> 49:19.123
Oh, buddy, what did you get us into, huh?

49:19.666 --> 49:22.001
I think you're muted. Yeah, you're muted.

49:24.712 --> 49:26.422
-<i>You would think I would know</i>...

49:26.422 --> 49:28.549
...<i>how to use Zoom by now. Okay, sorry.</i>

49:28.549 --> 49:31.803
<i>Um, so what I'd love to do
is just jump into</i>

49:31.803 --> 49:35.098
<i>the customer survey numbers
that came back.</i>

49:35.098 --> 49:37.058
<i>Um, I know we're just digging...</i>

49:40.436 --> 49:41.479
Hey.

49:42.939 --> 49:43.981
Hey.

49:43.981 --> 49:45.233
Uh...

49:47.068 --> 49:48.069
Wow.

49:48.069 --> 49:49.654
Aw.

49:49.654 --> 49:53.491
He was a little concerned
she wouldn't go for him with the cone on.

49:53.491 --> 49:54.575
So you had him...

49:54.575 --> 49:57.328
Yeah, just right off.

49:57.328 --> 50:00.748
But he's been acting strange
since before then.

50:00.748 --> 50:03.751
Yeah, Chloe's had a permanent case
of the Mondays.

50:03.751 --> 50:04.919
Mm.

50:04.919 --> 50:08.089
- Look at them now.
- Yeah, they clearly dig each other.

50:09.716 --> 50:11.008
- Oh, uh...
- Yeah?

50:11.926 --> 50:14.178
Sorry. He wouldn't give it up that easy.

50:14.178 --> 50:16.305
- At least not as easy as she did.
- Ha!

50:19.809 --> 50:24.605
Oh. Here. It's my half of the vet bill.

50:25.648 --> 50:26.649
Oh.

50:27.984 --> 50:29.444
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

50:30.278 --> 50:33.656
I also found some great podcasts
about raising puppies on Spotify.

50:33.656 --> 50:36.451
I can share the playlist I made
with you, if you want.

50:36.451 --> 50:37.618
That's actually really cool.

50:39.370 --> 50:42.165
Look, I know how long
this whole pregnancy thing lasts.

50:42.165 --> 50:45.668
And I do everything alone.
And I know how hard it is, and how...

50:45.668 --> 50:47.378
Look, I mean, honestly, I could...

50:48.963 --> 50:50.298
I couldn't have done the vet visit

50:50.298 --> 50:52.633
without somebody else there
helping me stay focused,

50:52.633 --> 50:54.051
even if it was you.

50:54.677 --> 50:55.970
Thanks. I think.

50:56.554 --> 51:00.349
And I've been reading online
about the mother's emotional well-being

51:00.349 --> 51:02.560
during the pregnancy
and how it can affect the puppies.

51:02.560 --> 51:06.439
And, I mean,
look how happy they are together, so...

51:07.523 --> 51:12.236
I don't know, what if we, as friends,
got them together for a few playdates?

51:12.236 --> 51:13.321
Just until the delivery?

51:13.321 --> 51:16.449
And, I don't know, we can just,
like, drop them off somewhere.

51:16.449 --> 51:19.285
I definitely do not want you
sticking around my place.

51:19.285 --> 51:20.953
Well, yeah,
I don't want you at my place either.

51:20.953 --> 51:22.288
Okay, cool, great.

51:22.288 --> 51:25.374
Then we can choose some place neutral
to let them meet up.

51:25.374 --> 51:26.626
Does that work for you?

51:26.626 --> 51:29.462
I mean, I guess we'll be
doing it for the kids, right?

51:31.631 --> 51:35.051
<i>You don't deliver the puppies. Mom does.</i>

51:35.051 --> 51:38.054
<i>Nature takes absolute control
of everything</i>

51:38.054 --> 51:40.848
<i>and it all runs smoothly. But...</i>

51:54.737 --> 51:56.656
It's nice to get that cone off, huh?

51:56.656 --> 51:58.157
That thing sucked.

51:58.908 --> 52:00.493
- Hi. Sorry.
- Hey.

52:00.493 --> 52:02.995
We, uh, we got a little lost. Um...

52:02.995 --> 52:05.039
- I've never been here before, so...
- Oh.

52:05.039 --> 52:07.959
Hi, Chloe. Oh, she's getting hefty.

52:07.959 --> 52:09.377
Hefty girl.

52:09.377 --> 52:12.588
Wait, you've lived here your entire life
and you've never been to Discovery Park?

52:12.588 --> 52:14.590
How is that even possible?

52:14.590 --> 52:17.134
Strangers, bacteria, wild animals.

52:17.134 --> 52:21.097
But I brought a first-aid kit
and bear repellent, non-toxic.

52:21.097 --> 52:23.558
- Very prepared. All right.
- Yeah, I try to be prepared.

52:23.558 --> 52:25.726
I take it you're not
a big hiker then, huh?

52:25.726 --> 52:26.894
No, I can hang.

52:29.355 --> 52:30.523
Nice cardigan.

52:31.440 --> 52:34.610
Thanks. I didn't know
I was supposed to dress like Danny Zuko.

52:35.945 --> 52:37.405
This is amazing.

52:38.114 --> 52:41.534
I could just sit here and chill.

52:42.243 --> 52:45.329
Yeah. It's my thinking spot.

52:45.329 --> 52:47.164
It gives me good vibes.

52:47.164 --> 52:49.917
Well, thanks for sharing
your spot with me... us.

52:52.795 --> 52:53.921
You're welcome.

52:57.717 --> 52:59.510
- Oh, shit.
- What?

53:00.428 --> 53:02.805
I just finished all my water
and I forgot to bring them some.

53:02.805 --> 53:04.181
Oh.

53:04.181 --> 53:06.893
I swear, I'm such
a selfish asshole sometimes.

53:06.893 --> 53:08.895
No, you're not. Here, I got it.

53:09.979 --> 53:12.857
- Got it. It's BPA-free, don't worry.
- Oh.

53:13.649 --> 53:15.651
Of course. I could only assume.

53:15.651 --> 53:18.070
Here you go, guys! Here you go.

53:34.170 --> 53:36.923
Shit, what am I gonna do?

53:41.636 --> 53:44.972
Okay, make sure you behave yourself.
He's doing us a big favor.

53:44.972 --> 53:47.141
-  Okay.

53:48.267 --> 53:49.435
- Hey.
- Hey.

53:49.435 --> 53:51.479
Hi. Okay, come on in.

53:52.229 --> 53:54.815
Um, I'm gonna need you
to put this on, if that's...

53:56.442 --> 53:57.985
- Really?
- Yeah, just in the house.

53:58.569 --> 53:59.779
- Okay.
- Sorry.

53:59.779 --> 54:01.781
- Do it quickly, if that's okay.

54:05.868 --> 54:08.621
I'm just kidding.
You don't have to wear that.

54:09.372 --> 54:10.373
You don't have to wear that.

54:10.373 --> 54:13.417
Would've been reasonably funny if
I weren't being threatened with eviction.

54:13.417 --> 54:15.503
- Yeah, no.
- They gave me two days...

54:15.503 --> 54:17.630
You are gonna have to take
your shoes off though. For real.

54:17.630 --> 54:19.590
- They gave me two days to decide.
- Yeah.

54:19.590 --> 54:21.884
Me or Channing has to go.

54:21.884 --> 54:25.388
And I'm really sorry, I just need a little
more time to figure out where to move.

54:25.388 --> 54:28.891
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Thank you for letting him stay.

54:28.891 --> 54:32.853
Yeah, I mean, it's a big step for me,
but it's what's best right now.

54:32.853 --> 54:35.439
- You know, for both of them, so...
-  Whoa.

54:35.439 --> 54:36.774
Just gonna have to... What?

54:36.774 --> 54:38.609
Wait, is this really from <i>The Godfather?</i>

54:38.609 --> 54:40.277
Uh, well, technically it is, but...

54:40.277 --> 54:42.196
That is my all-time favorite movie.

54:42.196 --> 54:45.241
- Which part?
- Not <i>Part III</i>, that's for damn sure.

54:45.241 --> 54:47.535
- Yeah. Wait, don't touch it!
- Jeez!

54:47.535 --> 54:49.870
- I'm sorry. I just...
- I didn't. Just...

54:49.870 --> 54:51.288
- You were going to.
- Oh.

54:51.288 --> 54:52.415
Oh, oh, oh.

54:52.415 --> 54:53.499
Yeah?

54:53.499 --> 54:57.253
Will you hook this up
to your Wi-Fi for me?

54:57.253 --> 54:59.005
Just so I can make sure he's okay.

54:59.005 --> 55:00.589
Uh, well, I can't let you on my network.

55:01.215 --> 55:02.216
Why?

55:02.216 --> 55:03.884
I'd have to give you my password.

55:04.760 --> 55:07.888
- And what if you see me in my underwear?
- Mm. That is not a vision that I need.

55:07.888 --> 55:09.932
Just please hook it up, just at night.

55:10.516 --> 55:12.643
Anything else of mine
you'd like to take over?

55:12.643 --> 55:15.980
Channing is used to his things,
so this will just...

55:15.980 --> 55:17.815
- Well, it doesn't have to...
- ...get him acclimated.

55:17.815 --> 55:20.276
- He likes them spread out?
- Wait, where is Channing?

55:20.276 --> 55:22.486
- I don't know.
- Ooh, I bet he's marking.

55:22.486 --> 55:23.946
You don't think he is, do you?

55:41.964 --> 55:43.466
Really?

55:46.886 --> 55:48.345
What happened? Is he okay?

55:48.345 --> 55:50.848
<i>Do you want to just come over
and sleep on the couch?</i>

55:50.848 --> 55:52.183
Really? Are you sure?

55:52.183 --> 55:54.310
<i>Yes, he misses you.</i>

56:06.113 --> 56:07.990
-  Hey.
- Hi.

56:07.990 --> 56:11.077
We're having a little family cuddle.
Aren't we?

56:14.789 --> 56:16.415
What's happening?

56:17.083 --> 56:18.209
Right. Well,

56:18.834 --> 56:20.544
I went to the Fremont Sunday Flea
this morning

56:20.544 --> 56:22.004
and I found all this great stuff.

56:22.004 --> 56:23.964
What... Okay. Yeah, um...

56:24.507 --> 56:26.425
Uh, why is it here?

56:26.425 --> 56:28.135
It's for the house that I'm staging.

56:28.135 --> 56:30.930
This way I don't have to keep going
back and forth from my place.

56:30.930 --> 56:32.139
It's just for a couple of days.

56:34.683 --> 56:38.312
But look, there's a path.
I mean, it's a little zig-zag-y, but...

56:38.312 --> 56:40.981
-"Zig-zag-y" isn't a word.
- Why are you freaking out?

56:40.981 --> 56:43.901
- You've disrupted my apartment.
- What does that mean exactly?

56:43.901 --> 56:47.780
I don't like junk all over my apartment.
Or people.

56:47.780 --> 56:50.324
- Um, I... I can't be... I'm gonna...
-  Okay.

56:50.324 --> 56:51.700
Chloe? Chloe, come on.

56:51.700 --> 56:53.410
Chloe, we're gonna...

56:53.410 --> 56:55.079
I, um... Yeah, I'm just gonna...

56:56.372 --> 56:57.540
Chloe, come on.

57:00.084 --> 57:02.211
Oh, my God. What just happened?

57:02.211 --> 57:05.089
I mean, am I crazy?
Am I being unreasonable?

57:05.089 --> 57:06.632
I feel like
she's being pretty inconsiderate.

57:06.632 --> 57:10.261
Who brings a bunch of garbage
to somebody else's apartment?

57:10.261 --> 57:12.471
It's unbelievable.

57:15.141 --> 57:17.143
I mean, I know I have some issues.

57:25.943 --> 57:27.987
Hey, look, thanks for listening.

57:29.947 --> 57:31.407
All right.

57:31.407 --> 57:33.617
Sometimes I just freak out. You know?
I just...

57:39.456 --> 57:41.333
Listen,
I'm gonna get out of your space.

57:41.333 --> 57:42.543
Hey, Nicole, I...

57:42.543 --> 57:44.795
This was a really, really bad idea.

57:44.795 --> 57:46.672
I've messaged some other friends
to see if they can take him.

57:46.672 --> 57:47.798
Nicole...

57:47.798 --> 57:50.634
I am sorry.

57:50.634 --> 57:51.802
Um...

57:51.802 --> 57:56.348
I have my own issues
and I'm trying to work on them.

57:56.348 --> 58:00.186
- Oh. So it's not all me?
- That's what I'm trying to say.

58:01.520 --> 58:04.607
I know rules
aren't really your thing, but,

58:04.607 --> 58:09.028
for me, they're how
I get through the day, so...

58:09.028 --> 58:11.822
Why do you think you worry so much?

58:11.822 --> 58:14.408
I don't know. I guess I've always
just kind of been a worrier.

58:14.408 --> 58:16.035
Even when you were a kid?

58:16.035 --> 58:20.706
I used to drive my parents crazy
with all my thoughts of bad shit.

58:21.916 --> 58:24.960
It's created a bit of loneliness.

58:25.461 --> 58:28.797
Yeah, and then I chose
to pursue music, which was stupid

58:28.797 --> 58:31.425
because, you know,
it sets you up for a lot of judgment.

58:31.425 --> 58:33.302
- And people really do judge.
- Yeah.

58:33.302 --> 58:35.304
Um...

58:35.304 --> 58:37.848
So, yeah, that kind of messed with
my whole confidence thing.

58:37.848 --> 58:40.017
- Yeah, I bet.
- Yeah.

58:40.017 --> 58:42.436
Then I met a girl who, uh...

58:44.063 --> 58:46.190
didn't really care about my issues.

58:46.190 --> 58:50.527
She seemed to love me
for who I was, which was cool.

58:50.527 --> 58:52.196
Really cool, in fact.

58:52.196 --> 58:56.158
And I was, um...
I was gonna propose to her.

58:56.158 --> 58:57.952
- Oh, wow!
- Mm-hmm.

58:58.953 --> 59:01.789
Until I got COVID.

59:02.790 --> 59:05.042
Fr... Um, from her.

59:05.876 --> 59:09.129
- Okay.
- Which she got from a dude.

59:09.129 --> 59:10.631
Oh.

59:10.631 --> 59:13.050
- Oh, no! She was cheating on you?
- Yeah.

59:13.634 --> 59:18.389
So, you know, I quarantined, um, solo
for, like, two years.

59:18.389 --> 59:20.724
But I actually really liked being alone,
you know?

59:20.724 --> 59:23.310
I'm better off by myself, I've realized.

59:23.310 --> 59:28.691
But it, you know,
perhaps explains my, uh, lameness.

59:28.691 --> 59:29.900
Max.

59:30.693 --> 59:33.529
Hey, I do not think you're lame.

59:34.697 --> 59:36.031
Seriously, at all.

59:36.031 --> 59:38.993
I'm actually really enjoying
getting to know you.

59:38.993 --> 59:40.244
Seriously.

59:43.956 --> 59:45.499
And I will... Oh.

59:46.667 --> 59:48.877
- Oh, my God. I...
- I'm sorry.

59:48.877 --> 59:50.879
- No, I thought...
- No, I...

59:50.879 --> 59:53.132
- Sorry, I was trying to lean...
- No, I'm sorry.

59:53.132 --> 59:54.216
- Don't be sorry.
- Why would you say sorry?

59:54.216 --> 59:56.343
- I just kissed your chin.
- Yeah, it's...

59:56.343 --> 59:57.428
I should...

01:00:08.772 --> 01:00:12.401
Look, I'm sorry
for taking over your sanctuary.

01:00:12.401 --> 01:00:14.153
- No, look...
- Seriously, Max.

01:00:14.153 --> 01:00:16.447
It's really nice
that you're letting me stay here

01:00:16.447 --> 01:00:19.283
and I will sign a new apartment lease
right after the puppies arrive.

01:00:19.283 --> 01:00:22.786
And I can even, you know,
help out around the house.

01:00:22.786 --> 01:00:23.996
I can cook.

01:00:23.996 --> 01:00:26.081
- That's okay.
- Okay, probably for the best.

01:00:26.081 --> 01:00:27.458
Um...

01:00:27.458 --> 01:00:30.627
Okay. Yeah, um, all right, offer accepted.

01:00:30.627 --> 01:00:31.712
Great.

01:00:38.635 --> 01:00:41.096
What the fuck?
Where the fuck are the towels?

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:43.724
Oh, my God.
Where are the towels?

01:00:46.101 --> 01:00:47.353
What the hell has she done with them?

01:00:47.353 --> 01:00:48.687
Oh, my God!

01:00:48.687 --> 01:00:51.023
What? What?

01:00:51.023 --> 01:00:52.858
Get out! What... Get out!

01:00:52.858 --> 01:00:53.942
Okay!

01:00:54.777 --> 01:00:56.612
Lock the door next time, dude.

01:00:56.612 --> 01:00:59.198
- Close the goddamn door!
- What did you say?

01:00:59.198 --> 01:01:00.574
- Yeah?
- No, no. Go!

01:01:00.574 --> 01:01:03.410
- Oh. You are so confusing.
- Go.

01:01:05.162 --> 01:01:08.374
Goddamn it. Okay, guys.
Come on, dogs. Go, go! Out.

01:01:08.374 --> 01:01:10.334
- Come on. Out, out.

01:01:10.334 --> 01:01:11.585
Go.

01:01:12.628 --> 01:01:15.923
God. For fuck's sake.

01:01:17.841 --> 01:01:19.551
- Hey, Max?
- What?

01:01:21.053 --> 01:01:22.429
Not bad.

01:01:30.437 --> 01:01:31.438
Okay, guys.

01:01:32.689 --> 01:01:33.732
Ready?

01:01:33.732 --> 01:01:37.861
No preservatives or fillers
or anything artificial.

01:01:41.782 --> 01:01:43.409
That's, like, really good.

01:01:44.910 --> 01:01:48.705
No, this is silly.
Look. Channing and Chloe.

01:01:48.705 --> 01:01:52.793
No, I mean, it's good...
I mean, all your art is awesome.

01:01:53.502 --> 01:01:55.087
You ever think about
doing it professionally?

01:01:55.796 --> 01:01:57.673
You ever think about
doing that professionally?

01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:06.890
Okay, I'm retreating now.

01:02:17.234 --> 01:02:22.197
<i>♪ Take my home and take my things ♪</i>

01:02:23.365 --> 01:02:28.203
<i>♪ I give my all to thee ♪</i>

01:02:29.163 --> 01:02:33.459
<i>♪ Take them for eternity ♪</i>

01:02:33.459 --> 01:02:39.465
<i>♪ Dearest Nicole-y ♪</i>

01:02:39.465 --> 01:02:42.134
<i>♪ Nicole-y, Nicole-y... ♪</i>

01:02:42.134 --> 01:02:44.887
Okay, okay.
All right, all right, all right.

01:02:44.887 --> 01:02:45.971
I get it.

01:02:47.264 --> 01:02:49.641
I wanted to go U-Dub for art and design,

01:02:49.641 --> 01:02:53.604
but my dad got sick, so I didn't,
and then he died, and now I'm here.

01:02:55.898 --> 01:02:56.899
Okay.

01:02:58.567 --> 01:02:59.568
Okay.

01:03:00.319 --> 01:03:01.987
Thanks for telling me that.

01:03:06.158 --> 01:03:09.161
I showed you mine. Play me a real song.

01:03:09.328 --> 01:03:11.079
No, that's not gonna happen.

01:03:11.079 --> 01:03:12.456
I'm turning it off, actually.

01:03:12.456 --> 01:03:13.540
Thank you very much.

01:03:15.876 --> 01:03:18.670
- Hey, I really like your tone, though.
- Shut up.

01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:20.172
Shuffling the deck.

01:03:20.172 --> 01:03:21.798
- Everyone has their card locked in.
- No cheating!

01:03:21.798 --> 01:03:23.300
No cheating. Okay?

01:03:25.427 --> 01:03:29.014
- I have not altered the deck of cards.
- Don't do any funny business.

01:03:29.014 --> 01:03:30.474
A little bit of magic.

01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:33.560
Was this your card?

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:35.145
- No way!

01:03:35.145 --> 01:03:36.355
- It was, huh?

01:03:36.355 --> 01:03:37.940
How did you do that?

01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:39.691
That's crazy.

01:03:39.691 --> 01:03:41.360
Blew your mind, Chloe.

01:03:58.252 --> 01:03:59.253
Uh-uh.

01:04:00.504 --> 01:04:01.547
Really?

01:04:04.633 --> 01:04:05.842
Just put it in.

01:04:16.895 --> 01:04:18.772
You should check out the classes we offer.

01:04:19.565 --> 01:04:21.650
Wait. Lamaze for dogs?

01:04:40.836 --> 01:04:42.713
- Oh, my God!
- Whoo!

01:04:42.713 --> 01:04:46.967
Just put it in your mouth.
Just put it in your mouth!

01:04:54.850 --> 01:04:56.977
Oh, my God! It worked! Oh, my God!

01:04:56.977 --> 01:04:59.688
-  Ah!
- Did you get it? Did you get it?

01:04:59.688 --> 01:05:00.897
I got it. I got it. Got it. Got it.

01:05:00.897 --> 01:05:02.441
- I got it.
- Good job, guys!

01:05:02.441 --> 01:05:03.525
Mine is good.

01:05:33.055 --> 01:05:34.222
Happy to see you, man.

01:05:34.222 --> 01:05:35.599
- How are you feeling?
- Yeah, good.

01:05:35.599 --> 01:05:36.850
- All right?
- Yeah.

01:05:39.227 --> 01:05:40.562
I wasn't gonna fire you.

01:05:55.661 --> 01:05:57.579
-  Okay.
-  Aw, good boy!

01:05:57.746 --> 01:05:59.581
Good boy! Did you...

01:05:59.581 --> 01:06:01.416
- Oh, wait. Did you... Oh!
- Okay.

01:06:01.416 --> 01:06:02.626
Oh, my God.

01:06:02.626 --> 01:06:06.755
- How does this even happen?
- Hold on. I got it. I got it. I got it.

01:06:06.755 --> 01:06:09.466
Okay. Hold on, I got it. I got it.
I got it. I got it.

01:06:09.466 --> 01:06:10.634
Okay, okay.

01:06:10.634 --> 01:06:11.718
I...

01:06:11.718 --> 01:06:13.595
- Sorry. It's...
- It's okay.

01:06:13.762 --> 01:06:16.223
- Okay.

01:06:22.145 --> 01:06:23.772
- Oh.

01:06:25.315 --> 01:06:27.067
Crap, we're gonna be late.

01:06:27.067 --> 01:06:29.611
Time to go to our class
full of dog people.

01:06:29.611 --> 01:06:30.737
Mm, all right.

01:06:31.279 --> 01:06:33.407
Wait. Are you...

01:06:33.407 --> 01:06:36.243
You're sure that
that won't make you anxious?

01:06:38.286 --> 01:06:39.871
No, I think I'm good.

01:06:49.923 --> 01:06:55.929
Hello, and welcome to your first
Doggie Lamaze session.

01:06:57.097 --> 01:07:00.475
When I say, "Who let the dogs out?"

01:07:00.475 --> 01:07:03.937
you say, "Ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff!"

01:07:04.104 --> 01:07:05.230
This is insane.

01:07:05.230 --> 01:07:07.315
-  I love it.
- Who let the dogs out?

01:07:07.315 --> 01:07:10.485
Ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff!

01:07:10.485 --> 01:07:12.279
I think we can do better than that.

01:07:12.279 --> 01:07:15.031
- Let's get on all fours.
-  Wait, what?

01:07:15.699 --> 01:07:16.783
I'm not doing it.

01:07:16.783 --> 01:07:18.493
Who let the dogs out?

01:07:18.493 --> 01:07:21.496
Ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff!

01:07:21.496 --> 01:07:27.127
Yes! See, dogs feed on our enthusiasm.

01:07:27.127 --> 01:07:30.839
So we want to show them
a lot of positive energy.

01:07:30.839 --> 01:07:35.677
We're gonna start today's class
by doing a bit of role play.

01:07:35.677 --> 01:07:37.095
- Okay?
- Fuck off.

01:07:37.095 --> 01:07:42.434
Can one grandparent please adopt
the female urination stance?

01:07:42.434 --> 01:07:45.604
Now, this is a common position

01:07:45.604 --> 01:07:50.025
that a bitch will adopt
during contractions.

01:07:50.025 --> 01:07:51.193
Okay?

01:07:51.193 --> 01:07:53.320
There. Good.

01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:55.572
I'm gonna go around
and check everyone out, okay?

01:07:55.572 --> 01:07:58.700
- Quick. You're gonna fall behind. Get up.
- Okay, all right.

01:07:58.700 --> 01:08:02.037
Okay. Oh, I almost stepped on your bitch.

01:08:02.037 --> 01:08:06.082
Oh, well, what a nice couple you are.

01:08:06.082 --> 01:08:08.001
- Oh, no. We're...
- Oh, no, we're not a couple.

01:08:08.001 --> 01:08:09.085
All right.

01:08:11.129 --> 01:08:13.215
-  How does that feel?
- It feels great.

01:08:13.215 --> 01:08:15.550
Mm-hmm. Okay.

01:08:15.550 --> 01:08:19.971
A gentle ear rub and panting encouragement

01:08:19.971 --> 01:08:22.641
when a bitch is having contractions

01:08:22.641 --> 01:08:25.852
can really help calm a laboring bitch.

01:08:25.852 --> 01:08:28.271
So let's all pant together, okay?

01:08:34.778 --> 01:08:36.196
-  Yes.
-  Yeah.

01:08:36.196 --> 01:08:38.114
See how he's doing over here?

01:08:38.114 --> 01:08:40.742
How are you guys doing? Good job.

01:08:40.742 --> 01:08:44.955
Ma'am, you need to get your crotch
lower to the floor. All right.

01:08:44.955 --> 01:08:47.207
I mean, she said
you were being a good bitch.

01:08:47.207 --> 01:08:48.834
- Let's try it again.
- Uh-uh.

01:08:48.834 --> 01:08:52.128
Did she have to use
the word "bitch" so much?

01:08:52.128 --> 01:08:54.005
You know what,
I actually learned something, though.

01:08:54.005 --> 01:08:55.966
Oh, yeah? We learned something?

01:08:55.966 --> 01:08:59.052
I mean, Nicole, she was dry-humping my leg

01:08:59.052 --> 01:09:01.596
and breathing into my face,
asking me to...

01:09:01.596 --> 01:09:05.183
- Heel, heel, heel, heel, heel, heel.
- Okay, you're not even listening.

01:09:05.183 --> 01:09:06.268
Halt.

01:09:07.143 --> 01:09:08.353
Socialize.

01:09:11.940 --> 01:09:14.234
- Rescue?
- Uh, yeah.

01:09:15.193 --> 01:09:16.194
Really?

01:09:16.903 --> 01:09:18.363
Yes, really. Yeah, really.

01:09:18.363 --> 01:09:20.699
Why'd you stutter? Are you lying?

01:09:20.699 --> 01:09:22.033
What? No.

01:09:22.033 --> 01:09:23.785
You don't look like a rescuer.

01:09:23.785 --> 01:09:26.288
What does a rescuer...
I mean, I assure you, she is a rescue.

01:09:26.288 --> 01:09:27.747
She better be.

01:09:27.747 --> 01:09:30.083
Hey! What's going on here?

01:09:30.083 --> 01:09:33.503
- This man is a breeder.
- Who are you calling a breeder?

01:09:33.503 --> 01:09:36.006
Listen, lady. Back off!

01:09:36.006 --> 01:09:37.340
Jesus.

01:09:40.051 --> 01:09:41.887
A dog's for life, not just for Christmas.

01:09:41.887 --> 01:09:45.181
Yeah, we know. It's fucking September.

01:09:46.474 --> 01:09:49.811
- That was amazing.
- Yeah, well, we're a pack, right?

01:09:49.811 --> 01:09:54.274
This week has been crazy,
but in a good way. In a good way.

01:09:54.274 --> 01:09:56.943
So, are you excited to be a dad?
You're gonna do so great.

01:09:56.943 --> 01:10:02.490
Hey, thank you so much for today.
That was so fun and so weird.

01:10:02.490 --> 01:10:05.160
Yeah, and thank you. It was a blast.

01:10:18.298 --> 01:10:19.382
Hey.

01:10:20.884 --> 01:10:21.885
Whoa.

01:10:22.510 --> 01:10:26.765
- What?
- You just... You look really, uh, good.

01:10:26.765 --> 01:10:28.058
Thanks.

01:10:32.562 --> 01:10:33.897
Do you want to go out?

01:10:33.897 --> 01:10:36.942
Yeah, right.

01:10:36.942 --> 01:10:39.486
No, come on. It'll be fun.

01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:42.072
Are you... Just you and me?

01:10:43.323 --> 01:10:44.449
Uh...

01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:48.495
No, no, no. I'm going to meet Shay.

01:10:48.495 --> 01:10:49.704
- Oh.
- Um...

01:10:49.704 --> 01:10:52.999
And Naomi, I think, later,
so I just, um...

01:10:52.999 --> 01:10:55.877
Just didn't want to exclude you
if you wanted to come out with us.

01:10:55.877 --> 01:10:58.046
Just... No. At a bar?

01:10:58.046 --> 01:10:59.339
Yeah.

01:10:59.339 --> 01:11:02.008
- Yeah, no, thanks. Um...
- Come on, it'll be fun.

01:11:02.008 --> 01:11:04.469
Somebody's gotta walk the dogs.

01:11:04.469 --> 01:11:05.553
Um...

01:11:05.553 --> 01:11:09.349
No, just not tonight.
I mean, actually I have other plans.

01:11:09.349 --> 01:11:11.476
- I've got some plans, so...
- Oh.

01:11:12.769 --> 01:11:14.562
Other plans. Okay.

01:11:14.562 --> 01:11:17.899
- I sometimes have plans too.
- Yeah, I get it.

01:11:18.441 --> 01:11:20.860
You've got plans.
Have fun with your plans.

01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:24.197
I will. They're real plans.

01:11:24.823 --> 01:11:26.282
Okay, my friend.

01:11:26.282 --> 01:11:27.909
Stop saying the word "plans."

01:11:27.909 --> 01:11:30.203
I'll be back later and I'll walk the dogs.

01:11:34.916 --> 01:11:37.210
- Thank you for hanging last minute.
- Of course, babe.

01:11:37.210 --> 01:11:39.754
I can't believe that hermit dude
turned down this dime-piece.

01:11:39.754 --> 01:11:41.297
- He's not a hermit.
- His loss.

01:11:41.297 --> 01:11:42.382
He's not.

01:11:44.092 --> 01:11:46.803
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

01:11:47.512 --> 01:11:49.055
What are you doing?

01:11:49.055 --> 01:11:51.599
- Hunter Fosterini just walked in.
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

01:11:51.599 --> 01:11:53.435
I saw he texted
while you were in the bathroom,

01:11:53.435 --> 01:11:55.270
so I responded with your location.

01:11:55.270 --> 01:11:56.980
Goddamn it, Shay, why?

01:11:56.980 --> 01:11:59.315
I thought you'd want a rebound beard
since you were rejected.

01:11:59.315 --> 01:12:00.859
Well, I don't.

01:12:00.859 --> 01:12:02.819
Really? You've changed.

01:12:02.819 --> 01:12:05.697
- That's awesome, Nic. Oh! Oh, oh.
- Hide me. Hide me. Hide me. Hide me.

01:12:05.697 --> 01:12:07.240
- Please!
-  Okay. Uh, I don't...

01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:09.367
Ding dong!

01:12:10.452 --> 01:12:11.661
Hi!

01:12:11.661 --> 01:12:13.872
Hey, Nicole. Yo!

01:12:13.872 --> 01:12:15.832
- Hey.
- How are you?

01:12:15.832 --> 01:12:16.916
Are you good?

01:12:16.916 --> 01:12:19.085
No, Nicole. I am not good.

01:12:19.085 --> 01:12:21.296
As you know, I put my house
on the market this week.

01:12:21.296 --> 01:12:22.630
- Yeah.
- And it sold.

01:12:22.630 --> 01:12:26.009
For 500,000 over asking, all Ethereum.

01:12:26.009 --> 01:12:28.845
So, no. No, Nicole. I am not good.

01:12:28.845 --> 01:12:32.724
I'm fricking fantastic!
You did amazing!

01:12:32.724 --> 01:12:35.143
A drink for everybody! Tequila, eh?

01:12:39.189 --> 01:12:40.565
Ah. Ugh!

01:12:40.565 --> 01:12:44.027
It went up my nose!

- Huh?

01:13:21.314 --> 01:13:23.399
- Are you from here?
- Ah.

01:13:23.399 --> 01:13:25.485
Is your family here? They live here?

01:13:25.485 --> 01:13:27.987
- You're funny. I like funny.
- I'm funny?

01:13:27.987 --> 01:13:29.656
You're funny, yes.

01:13:29.656 --> 01:13:31.866
How'd you get to be so chill?

01:13:32.909 --> 01:13:34.077
- What?
- Plus, I, uh...

01:13:36.246 --> 01:13:37.831
- What? I don't...

01:13:37.831 --> 01:13:38.957
Oh.

01:13:38.957 --> 01:13:40.458
Beautiful.

01:13:43.253 --> 01:13:46.965
- Mm.
- Oh. Oh, oh. Okay.

01:13:48.174 --> 01:13:50.677
- Shh.

01:13:50.677 --> 01:13:53.805
- Please be quiet. Don't touch anything.
-  Shh. Shh.

01:13:53.805 --> 01:13:56.432
It's tiny.

01:13:56.432 --> 01:13:57.851
It's charming.

01:13:57.851 --> 01:13:59.269
- Okay, I'm gonna walk the dogs.
- Charming.

01:13:59.269 --> 01:14:01.855
- All right.
- Ah, look, like, little dogs!

01:14:01.855 --> 01:14:03.940
Shh. Please don't touch anything.

01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:05.358
- No, no, no.

01:14:05.358 --> 01:14:06.901
Please. No touching. Shh.

01:14:11.406 --> 01:14:13.449
Who is this? What's...

01:14:13.449 --> 01:14:14.576
Hey.

01:14:15.201 --> 01:14:18.955
Uh, this is Hunter.

01:14:18.955 --> 01:14:20.498
I'm her boss.

01:14:21.541 --> 01:14:23.710
- Who are you?
- I live here.

01:14:23.710 --> 01:14:26.880
This is Max. He's my... roommate.

01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:29.299
Ah, cute. Roommates.

01:14:29.299 --> 01:14:31.926
Eh, a little small for a roommate.

01:14:31.926 --> 01:14:33.428
-  Oh!
- Oh.

01:14:33.428 --> 01:14:35.096
Hey. Hey, no, no, no, no, no!

01:14:35.096 --> 01:14:37.473
- I think I broke a tooth!
- Give that to me.

01:14:37.473 --> 01:14:39.601
-  Relax.
- Those are collectibles, man!

01:14:39.601 --> 01:14:43.354
- So I'll buy you a new one.
- Buy me a new...

01:14:43.354 --> 01:14:45.064
Can I talk to you for a second
in privacy, please?

01:14:45.064 --> 01:14:46.983
Yeah. Oh, my... Jesus.

01:14:46.983 --> 01:14:49.027
Relax. I'll buy you 10, 20.

01:14:49.027 --> 01:14:51.779
Who is this douchebag?
Did you seriously bring a guy back here?

01:14:51.779 --> 01:14:53.615
I said that I was gonna walk
the dogs tonight.

01:14:53.615 --> 01:14:54.782
I'm just trying to help out.

01:14:54.782 --> 01:14:57.785
You're trying to help by bringing
Italian Fabio back to the house?

01:14:57.785 --> 01:15:00.163
Yeah. He's the CEO of Crypt-Yo.

01:15:00.163 --> 01:15:01.581
What the fuck is Crypt-Yo?

01:15:01.581 --> 01:15:03.750
It's the house that I'm staging.
It's really important to me.

01:15:03.750 --> 01:15:05.210
You're staging a house for this mother...

01:15:05.210 --> 01:15:06.669
- Hey! No!

01:15:06.669 --> 01:15:08.796
Hey. Give that back to me right now!

01:15:08.796 --> 01:15:11.257
You can't buy me a new one.
It's irreplaceable, you dick!

01:15:11.257 --> 01:15:13.927
Do... Give it to me. Oh, my God.

01:15:15.386 --> 01:15:18.223
Max, I'm really sorry.
Oh, please don't touch the dogs.

01:15:18.223 --> 01:15:20.225
-  Hey, no, no, no, no.
- Oh, little puppy!

01:15:20.225 --> 01:15:22.435
Do not fuck with my dog, okay?

01:15:22.435 --> 01:15:27.357
Bro, sit the fuck down or I'm gonna
give you a spanking like a little baby.

01:15:27.357 --> 01:15:29.067
- Can we just... Let's not.

01:15:29.067 --> 01:15:30.944
- Oh!

01:15:30.944 --> 01:15:32.320
Ah.

01:15:33.863 --> 01:15:37.325
- You like that? Huh?

01:15:37.325 --> 01:15:40.453
Jerker. You want it, huh?

01:15:40.453 --> 01:15:44.457
Bitch pig, huh? Spunk... Spunk man, huh?

01:15:44.457 --> 01:15:46.167
Spunk?

01:15:46.167 --> 01:15:47.710
- Huh?
- Hi-yah!

01:15:47.710 --> 01:15:48.878
Jesus.

01:15:51.172 --> 01:15:53.091
-  Hunter.
- Come on, bring it! Come on.

01:15:53.091 --> 01:15:55.260
Hunter, this is so weird.

01:15:55.260 --> 01:15:58.346
I think you need to go.
Like, it's really time to leave.

01:15:58.346 --> 01:15:59.597
It's time to go, Hunter.

01:15:59.597 --> 01:16:01.391
Good luck with, uh...

01:16:02.725 --> 01:16:03.726
This.

01:16:07.689 --> 01:16:10.233
Whoo! Whoo!

01:16:11.401 --> 01:16:13.569
Max, I am so sorry.

01:16:14.612 --> 01:16:16.698
Everywhere you go, chaos just follows you.

01:16:16.698 --> 01:16:17.824
Chaos?

01:16:17.824 --> 01:16:18.908
What do you mean?

01:16:18.908 --> 01:16:22.036
Like the things that come with having
a life outside of your own apartment?

01:16:22.036 --> 01:16:24.622
Not just reading
other people's Yelp reviews.

01:16:25.581 --> 01:16:28.751
You left a bowl of disgusting old milk
and cereal in the bathroom.

01:16:28.751 --> 01:16:31.754
Who eats any kind of food
in the bathroom, let alone cereal?

01:16:31.754 --> 01:16:33.673
- What are you talking about?

01:16:33.673 --> 01:16:37.468
Okay, okay, but if we're on the topic
of bathrooms, do you know what you do?

01:16:37.468 --> 01:16:40.638
You go in the bathroom, and then
you spray that little lavender spritz...

01:16:40.638 --> 01:16:41.723
Yeah.

01:16:41.723 --> 01:16:43.766
...and it's a dead giveaway
for what just happened in there.

01:16:43.766 --> 01:16:45.977
- Oh, it's called being considerate.
- Okay.

01:16:45.977 --> 01:16:50.273
And B, you are incapable of turning off a
light switch after you've been in a room.

01:16:50.273 --> 01:16:51.816
Okay, cool. That's really fucking cool!

01:16:51.816 --> 01:16:53.526
- No, it's not fucking cool.
- All right, you know what else...

01:16:53.526 --> 01:16:54.652
- It's fucked up 'cause it's wasteful.
- You know what else that you do

01:16:54.652 --> 01:16:56.446
- that just is infuriating?
- What? What?

01:16:56.446 --> 01:16:58.448
The way that you delicately sip.

01:16:58.448 --> 01:17:00.908
- It makes my skin crawl.
- I don't even...

01:17:00.908 --> 01:17:02.535
I'm sorry, so I should just chug

01:17:02.535 --> 01:17:04.620
every drink that's ever
put in front of me like you

01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:07.415
so I can get trashed
and hook up with dirty strangers?

01:17:08.833 --> 01:17:10.585
Like me?

01:17:10.585 --> 01:17:12.837
Max, you are such a pathetic loser.

01:17:16.591 --> 01:17:20.219
Well, I'd rather be a loser
than a closed-off, selfish asshole.

01:17:22.430 --> 01:17:23.431
Wow.

01:17:30.355 --> 01:17:32.106
- Where's Chloe?
- I... I don't know.

01:17:32.106 --> 01:17:34.609
- Chloe?
- Oh, my... Where's Chloe?

01:17:34.609 --> 01:17:36.361
- I don't... What...
- Oh, my God.

01:17:36.361 --> 01:17:37.987
- Chloe?
- Are you fucking...

01:17:37.987 --> 01:17:39.155
- Chloe?
- Jesus.

01:17:39.155 --> 01:17:40.573
Wait, I'm gonna come with you.

01:17:40.573 --> 01:17:42.867
Absolute chaos.
No, you just stay here, okay?

01:17:42.867 --> 01:17:44.327
- You've done enough.
- Max! I...

01:17:44.327 --> 01:17:46.245
-  Chloe?

01:17:48.247 --> 01:17:49.374
Chloe!

01:17:56.297 --> 01:17:57.965
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

01:17:57.965 --> 01:17:59.050
Hi, yeah, uh...

01:17:59.050 --> 01:18:04.097
I guess it's not 911, but my, um,
my dog is missing and I, uh...

01:18:04.097 --> 01:18:06.557
<i>Okay, sir,
you need to call animal control.</i>

01:18:06.557 --> 01:18:10.311
I'm sorry, animal control?
I'm supposed to call... Fuck me.

01:18:10.311 --> 01:18:11.562
Hey, excuse me.
Have you seen a little dog?

01:18:11.562 --> 01:18:12.647
- Have you... No?
- No.

01:18:13.564 --> 01:18:15.858
Have you guys seen a dog?
A little dog... A black... No?

01:18:15.858 --> 01:18:18.820
Fucking... Chloe! Chloe.

01:18:18.820 --> 01:18:20.279
Fuck. What am I gonna do?

01:18:20.279 --> 01:18:21.697
- What am I fucking...

01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:28.621
It's gonna be okay.

01:18:31.582 --> 01:18:34.085
- Hey, it's gonna be okay.

01:19:02.363 --> 01:19:03.489
Chloe!

01:19:08.703 --> 01:19:09.912
Chloe!

01:19:22.341 --> 01:19:25.470
- Hey. Hey, come here.

01:19:31.309 --> 01:19:32.602
I'm sorry.

01:19:38.649 --> 01:19:39.859
He's gonna find her.

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:06.344
- Thank God. Where was she?

01:20:06.344 --> 01:20:07.929
You're still here? Why?

01:20:07.929 --> 01:20:10.681
I... I couldn't leave
until I knew she was okay.

01:20:10.681 --> 01:20:12.350
Well, now you know, so...

01:20:15.561 --> 01:20:17.855
Okay. Yeah, okay. I'm gonna go.

01:20:18.606 --> 01:20:21.859
Uh, I'll just come back later
for my stuff.

01:20:23.861 --> 01:20:25.238
I'll see you soon, buddy. Okay?

01:20:25.238 --> 01:20:27.240
He can go with you.

01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:30.493
What? No, you know that I'll get evicted.

01:20:30.493 --> 01:20:33.287
He's not my dog, and I'm not your sitter.

01:20:34.121 --> 01:20:36.457
- Dude, seriously?
- Yeah.

01:20:36.457 --> 01:20:38.626
I've got Yelp reviews to read.

01:20:41.337 --> 01:20:43.047
Okay. Come on.

01:21:05.820 --> 01:21:07.071
Hey, Chloe.

01:21:09.073 --> 01:21:10.575
What is this?

01:21:14.328 --> 01:21:16.122
Yeah, I miss her too.

01:21:29.927 --> 01:21:31.345
Do you want to play?

01:21:32.847 --> 01:21:34.181
You're not in the mood.

01:21:35.308 --> 01:21:36.309
I get it.

01:21:39.979 --> 01:21:41.230
Hold on.

01:21:41.897 --> 01:21:43.149
Don't pull.

01:21:50.573 --> 01:21:51.866
Oh, my God.

01:22:08.716 --> 01:22:09.717
Hey.

01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:13.888
They want to meet me.
They want to meet me!

01:22:27.151 --> 01:22:30.071
<i>Ah, bro, you were doing so good!
Then you lost it.</i>

01:22:30.071 --> 01:22:32.239
<i>I'm not gonna have you go dark on me
as a friend again.</i>

01:22:32.239 --> 01:22:35.201
<i>You know how hard it is for men
to find friends in their 30s?</i>

01:22:35.201 --> 01:22:37.370
<i>Where I'ma go? Jamba Juice?</i>

01:22:37.370 --> 01:22:39.997
Man, I'm better off by myself.

01:22:39.997 --> 01:22:41.749
I told her everything.

01:22:41.749 --> 01:22:44.835
I told her about getting cheated on,
and she just goes and does the same thing.

01:22:44.835 --> 01:22:47.880
<i>But she never cheated on you.
You just didn't show her how you felt.</i>

01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:49.840
Can you just stop judging me for...

01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:52.009
<i>Me, judging you? You judge everyone!</i>

01:22:52.009 --> 01:22:55.763
<i>Nobody's never good enough for you.
That's why you by your damn self.</i>

01:22:55.763 --> 01:22:59.433
<i>The truth of the matter is,
you do way better with Chloe and Nicole.</i>

01:22:59.433 --> 01:23:01.686
<i>And you need to be honest
with yourself about that.</i>

01:23:01.686 --> 01:23:03.813
<i>You gotta tell her how you feel.</i>

01:23:03.813 --> 01:23:06.232
<i>The chaos of the world is here to stay.</i>

01:23:06.232 --> 01:23:08.484
<i>Bro, just face it.</i>

01:23:08.984 --> 01:23:10.528
<i>Face it as a pack.</i>

01:23:12.071 --> 01:23:13.364
How's your furry dependent?

01:23:13.948 --> 01:23:14.949
I don't know.

01:23:14.949 --> 01:23:18.786
I feel like he would be happier with Chloe
and Max than he is with me right now,

01:23:18.786 --> 01:23:21.831
and I still haven't found an apartment
I can afford that takes dogs.

01:23:21.831 --> 01:23:24.792
Are you really trying to tell me you think
that dog is better off without you?

01:23:24.792 --> 01:23:28.003
I mean, maybe everyone is right.
Maybe I am selfish.

01:23:29.338 --> 01:23:31.173
I just feel like a fucking mess.

01:23:31.173 --> 01:23:34.176
Okay. I want to say something to you,

01:23:34.969 --> 01:23:38.264
but I don't want you to punch me
in the face when I say it.

01:23:39.056 --> 01:23:41.392
That happened one time.
Okay? We were five.

01:23:43.644 --> 01:23:44.687
Look,

01:23:45.855 --> 01:23:50.359
since you lost your dad,
you've put up some major walls.

01:23:50.359 --> 01:23:52.194
And they may be really cool walls,

01:23:52.194 --> 01:23:55.740
covered in, you know,
stained glass and vintage fabrics,

01:23:55.740 --> 01:23:57.408
but they're still walls.

01:23:58.868 --> 01:24:03.122
Babe, you really gotta ask yourself,
what are these walls getting you?

01:24:06.041 --> 01:24:09.503
- Who is it? It's so early.

01:24:13.966 --> 01:24:15.384
What the hell?

01:24:23.225 --> 01:24:24.226
Jesus!

01:24:25.561 --> 01:24:26.645
Hey.

01:24:27.688 --> 01:24:30.608
Hi. What? Why are you in a box?

01:24:32.109 --> 01:24:33.319
Hey.

01:24:34.069 --> 01:24:35.362
What are you doing?

01:24:38.699 --> 01:24:41.660
Can you ask your mom
if this is an authentic Glengholm?

01:24:41.827 --> 01:24:44.038
Huh? Where is she?

01:24:44.955 --> 01:24:50.169
That is the Rolls-Royce
of Swedish whelping boxes right there.

01:24:51.128 --> 01:24:53.172
Only the best for Chloe's delivery.

01:24:56.592 --> 01:24:57.593
Thanks.

01:24:59.303 --> 01:25:01.096
- Can we talk?
- Yeah.

01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:04.391
- Look, I, uh...
- No, Max...

01:25:05.392 --> 01:25:06.644
I'm sorry.

01:25:08.729 --> 01:25:10.272
I overstepped.

01:25:12.149 --> 01:25:14.109
Especially after everything
you've done for me,

01:25:14.109 --> 01:25:18.113
and how you opened up to me about your ex.

01:25:18.113 --> 01:25:19.740
And I'm not...

01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:23.577
I know that we're not
a thing or whatever, but...

01:25:25.037 --> 01:25:27.915
I mean, it wasn't cool
and I really regret it.

01:25:27.915 --> 01:25:29.333
And I'm sorry.

01:25:31.669 --> 01:25:36.257
Well, I really regret not dealing
with it better, and I'm sorry.

01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:41.470
What you said was kinda true.

01:25:43.973 --> 01:25:46.141
Yeah, I mean,
you were pretty accurate about me too.

01:25:47.977 --> 01:25:51.814
I guess we both kinda got some things.

01:25:51.814 --> 01:25:54.692
Yeah. [chuckles] Yeah, I'd say we do.

01:26:00.906 --> 01:26:03.534
I really like having you in my life.

01:26:04.994 --> 01:26:05.995
Yeah, me too.

01:26:11.834 --> 01:26:13.919
Honestly, it's just hard...

01:26:16.088 --> 01:26:17.923
It's hard to care about someone
when you know

01:26:17.923 --> 01:26:20.009
that they can just be taken away from you.

01:26:24.555 --> 01:26:27.141
I'm just scared, Max.

01:26:27.141 --> 01:26:28.225
I know.

01:26:38.861 --> 01:26:40.946
Are you kidding me?

01:26:44.366 --> 01:26:47.119
-  I could have helped with the box.
-  I got it.

01:26:47.119 --> 01:26:48.787
Okay, Chloe. Go ahead.

01:26:48.787 --> 01:26:51.206
Good girl. Good girl.

01:26:58.923 --> 01:27:00.633
I thought they looked good there.

01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:11.852
Oh, my God. I missed you guys so much.

01:27:15.731 --> 01:27:17.816
- Hey, can you take your shoes off?
- Yeah.

01:27:19.109 --> 01:27:21.028
These instructions are in Swedish.

01:27:21.028 --> 01:27:24.281
Yeah, we'll just attach
the "golv" to the "vagg"...

01:27:24.281 --> 01:27:25.950
- Oh, my God.
- ...using the "ryka."

01:27:27.159 --> 01:27:29.244
- Okay, we'll just wing it.
- Yeah.

01:27:30.079 --> 01:27:31.664
I can't read Swedish, so...

01:27:31.664 --> 01:27:34.792
- And I don't think it says "vagg."

01:27:34.792 --> 01:27:37.086
All right, step one.

01:27:37.836 --> 01:27:42.508
I'm gonna miss this whole roomie sitch
after the puppies are born.

01:27:44.593 --> 01:27:45.678
Yeah, me too.

01:27:52.476 --> 01:27:53.978
You ready?

01:27:53.978 --> 01:27:55.479
For what, dinner?

01:27:58.107 --> 01:28:00.317
No. Absolutely not.

01:28:00.317 --> 01:28:02.444
I thought we were just gonna have
a casual roommate's dinner.

01:28:02.444 --> 01:28:06.740
Max, you helped me fill out my U-Dub app.
This is me pushing you.

01:28:06.740 --> 01:28:10.035
All right, I don't want to be pushed
to do this. I...

01:28:10.035 --> 01:28:11.537
Max, you are doing so good.

01:28:11.537 --> 01:28:14.581
But I don't...
This would ruin everything. Seriously.

01:28:14.581 --> 01:28:17.167
Well, what if something happens to me?
What if this is my last night alive?

01:28:18.002 --> 01:28:19.044
Why do you have to go so dark?

01:28:19.044 --> 01:28:21.964
Because I figured out
that it makes you do what we both want.

01:28:22.798 --> 01:28:23.799
Come on.

01:28:24.883 --> 01:28:26.093
We can watch.

01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:29.805
Hey, guys, how's it going?
Sign up right here.

01:28:29.805 --> 01:28:32.891
Do not sign me up.
I'm not doing it if they call me.

01:28:33.767 --> 01:28:34.768
One more time!

01:28:34.768 --> 01:28:36.020
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

This is not normal.
This isn't right. This guy's insane.

01:28:45.779 --> 01:28:48.699
He's gotta be, like,
professional or something.

01:28:48.699 --> 01:28:50.743
- Hey, you're gonna be fine.
- No, but this is, like, his concert.

01:28:50.743 --> 01:28:52.202
- Hey.
- This is not open mic.

01:28:53.996 --> 01:28:55.622
That was spectacular!

01:28:55.622 --> 01:28:57.207

to follow that, people!

01:29:01.962 --> 01:29:03.881
Max Stevenson.

- Whoo!

01:29:06.759 --> 01:29:08.010
- Hey. Hey.
- I'm not going up.

01:29:08.010 --> 01:29:09.678
- I fucking can't. I'm not kidding.
- Listen. Shh, shh!

01:29:09.678 --> 01:29:11.305

- Listen. Look me in the eye.

01:31:50.714 --> 01:31:54.760
-  Yeah!

01:32:02.851 --> 01:32:04.394
- Good boy. Good boy.
- Okay.

01:32:04.394 --> 01:32:05.729
You ready for your interview?

01:32:05.729 --> 01:32:07.272
-  Yeah.
-  Yeah?

01:32:07.272 --> 01:32:09.191
Aw.

01:32:09.191 --> 01:32:11.860
That's so sweet. Thank you, guys.

01:32:11.860 --> 01:32:14.947
Are you sure you don't mind driving me?
I'm, like, really nervous.

01:32:14.947 --> 01:32:18.408
Yeah, of course. All right,
we're your emotional support mammals.

01:32:18.408 --> 01:32:19.868
- Get off her.
- Yes.

01:32:19.868 --> 01:32:20.994
All right, road trip.

01:32:21.703 --> 01:32:24.498
You're gonna do so great.
They're lucky they get to meet with you.

01:32:28.377 --> 01:32:29.878
Do you smell something funny?

01:32:31.255 --> 01:32:32.965
- What? No.
- Oh, man.

01:32:32.965 --> 01:32:35.300
- What?
- I think one of them peed.

01:32:35.300 --> 01:32:36.760
In the car?

01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:39.930
I knew I should have just got
the plastic covers for the seats.

01:32:39.930 --> 01:32:43.392
I think it was Chloe.
She went on the carpet last night too.

01:32:43.392 --> 01:32:48.021
- You didn't tell me that. Did you, uh...
- Yes, I used the Nature's Miracle.

01:32:51.316 --> 01:32:54.820
- What's going on back there?
- I don't know. They're getting zoomies.

01:32:54.820 --> 01:32:57.447
- Can we please be respectful of the seats?

01:32:57.447 --> 01:33:00.075
She keeps licking her hoo-ha.

01:33:00.075 --> 01:33:01.827
- What do you mean? What?
- Oh, my God.

01:33:01.827 --> 01:33:03.412
I think that she might be in labor.

01:33:03.412 --> 01:33:04.496
- No! No!
- Yeah!

01:33:04.496 --> 01:33:05.998
I don't think that that was pee.

01:33:05.998 --> 01:33:07.374
- Like, I think that her water broke.
- No.

01:33:07.374 --> 01:33:10.377
- She's not due for three days!
- Yeah, but it's not like an exact science.

01:33:10.377 --> 01:33:11.461
- Shit, we gotta get to a vet.
- What?

01:33:11.461 --> 01:33:14.006
What do you mean, a vet?
What about your interview?

01:33:14.006 --> 01:33:15.841
A premature delivery
can be really dangerous.

01:33:15.841 --> 01:33:16.967
We gotta go, like, right now!

01:33:16.967 --> 01:33:19.886
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.
- Wait, where are we even going?

01:33:19.886 --> 01:33:21.638
- Google something!
- I am.

01:33:22.973 --> 01:33:25.100
- Is she okay?
- Well, she's still licking her hoo-ha.

01:33:25.100 --> 01:33:28.103
Is her hoo-ha okay?
And can we please use proper terms?

01:33:28.103 --> 01:33:29.938
She's about to give birth.
We need to be technical.

01:33:29.938 --> 01:33:32.357
Okay, technically,
she is licking her vulva.

01:33:32.357 --> 01:33:34.609
- Oh, I want to try that spot.
-  Nicole!

01:33:34.609 --> 01:33:35.819
Okay! Wait.

01:33:36.695 --> 01:33:38.363
Wait. Okay, turn right. Now.

01:33:40.615 --> 01:33:42.784
Very good. I think we made a wrong turn.

01:33:42.784 --> 01:33:45.370
- What? Is she okay?
- Well, she's...

01:33:45.370 --> 01:33:47.956
Oh, my God! It's happening!

01:33:48.123 --> 01:33:50.000
Okay, let's go!

01:33:51.251 --> 01:33:53.503
- Why are you puking?
- Get the gloves out of the glove box!

01:33:53.503 --> 01:33:55.172
Okay, okay, wait. Where are they?

01:33:55.172 --> 01:33:57.049
- In the glove box!
- Do you need, like, a ginger ale?

01:33:57.049 --> 01:33:58.383
- I don't need a ginger ale!
- Something bubbly?

01:33:58.383 --> 01:33:59.468
- Good girl.
- Good girl.

01:33:59.468 --> 01:34:00.677
Okay, get the blanket.
Get the blanket and lay it out.

01:34:00.677 --> 01:34:02.804
- Come on, come on. Lay it out! Here.
- Okay, I got it.

01:34:02.804 --> 01:34:03.889
- Put the blanket down.
- Okay.

01:34:03.889 --> 01:34:05.390
Wait, pull up YouTube.
Pull up YouTube.

01:34:05.390 --> 01:34:07.517
- What are you doing?

01:34:07.517 --> 01:34:09.561
- Nothing. The dogs are tired.
- Oh, just nap time. Sleepy time.

01:34:09.561 --> 01:34:10.645
- Nap time.
- Yeah. It's probably your nap time now.

01:34:10.645 --> 01:34:11.730
- Go ahead.
- All right.

01:34:11.730 --> 01:34:12.814
<i>The female hyena's birth canal</i>...

01:34:12.814 --> 01:34:13.899
- You got it?
- Yeah, I got it.

01:34:13.899 --> 01:34:15.484
- That's the best you could find?
- Yeah, I mean, it's hyenas.

01:34:15.484 --> 01:34:16.568
...<i>is only an inch in diameter...</i>

01:34:16.568 --> 01:34:18.820
You can't do that here.
Recess starts in two minutes.

01:34:18.820 --> 01:34:20.822
Well, we didn't seek out
the most idyllic birthing spot, lady!

01:34:20.822 --> 01:34:23.658
- But there's children.
- They're about to get a biology lesson!

01:34:23.658 --> 01:34:27.662
You're, like, at a ten. Bring it down.
What the teacher said. Like...

01:34:27.662 --> 01:34:29.122
Ha!

01:34:29.122 --> 01:34:31.083
I knew you were a breeder!

01:34:31.083 --> 01:34:32.501
-  Fuck off!
-  Language!

01:34:32.501 --> 01:34:33.960
- Where did she come from?
- I don't know.

01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:35.545
It's happening. It's happening.
It's happening. She's crowning.

01:34:35.545 --> 01:34:37.714
- That's gross!
-  Holy shit.

01:34:37.714 --> 01:34:38.840
- It's coming! It's coming!
- Oh, my God.

01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:41.551
It's coming! It's happening.

01:34:42.928 --> 01:34:45.013
Oh, my God. That's like...

01:34:45.013 --> 01:34:49.226
- Oh, my God.
- That's a puppy. That's a puppy head.

01:34:51.311 --> 01:34:55.399
Vito Corleone Stevenson-Matthews,
Michael Corleone Stevenson-Matthews,

01:34:55.399 --> 01:34:59.236
Sonny Corleone Stevenson-Matthews,
Grand Moff Tarkin Stevenson-Matthews...

01:34:59.236 --> 01:35:03.281
And Babu Frik Stevenson-Matthews.

01:35:04.741 --> 01:35:06.660
- What is that?
- That's Babu Frik.

01:35:06.660 --> 01:35:08.453
- Oh.
- Don't worry about it.

01:35:08.453 --> 01:35:11.289
Were you able to, um,
talk to the admissions office?

01:35:11.289 --> 01:35:13.375
- Could you reschedule your interview?
- Voice mail.

01:35:14.209 --> 01:35:16.086
They haven't responded to my emails.

01:35:16.878 --> 01:35:18.880
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

01:35:20.173 --> 01:35:22.801
My dad always said
that everything happens for a reason.

01:35:24.219 --> 01:35:27.722
And right now,
I'm meant to be a doggie grandma.

01:35:29.641 --> 01:35:31.059
And I'm happy with that.

01:35:49.953 --> 01:35:50.954
Nicole.

01:35:51.663 --> 01:35:52.664
Hmm?

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:56.126
What?

01:36:33.705 --> 01:36:35.248
- Mm. Chloe. Chloe.
- What? What is it?

01:36:35.248 --> 01:36:36.333
- Chloe's looking at us.
- Oh.

01:36:36.333 --> 01:36:40.003
Chloe? Chloe, can you...
I gotta... Chloe, come on. Go.

01:36:41.129 --> 01:36:43.340
Come on. Chloe, come on. Go, go, go.

01:36:43.340 --> 01:36:45.008
Thank you. Okay.

01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:53.391
- What?
- Jesus Christ.

01:36:53.391 --> 01:36:54.893
Channing Tatum's watching us.

01:36:54.893 --> 01:36:57.521
Come on, buddy. Come on.
Mama's busy. Come on.

01:36:57.521 --> 01:36:58.647
Come on.

01:36:59.564 --> 01:37:01.650
Okay, just stay in here, please.

01:37:01.650 --> 01:37:03.610
Okay, good boy. Holy shit.

01:37:23.755 --> 01:37:25.340
No, no, no.

01:37:25.340 --> 01:37:27.759
- No, no, no, no! This is incestuous.

01:37:27.759 --> 01:37:30.804
- Come on. Get off. Get off. Channing, no.
- Yeah, but you turned him on.

01:37:30.804 --> 01:37:32.764
No, don't say that.
Come on, don't say that.

01:37:32.764 --> 01:37:35.267
- Go! Come on, guys, I...
- Oh, man.

01:37:37.018 --> 01:37:39.980
God. Let's go to the bedroom.

01:37:39.980 --> 01:37:41.147
Yeah.

01:37:49.322 --> 01:37:51.575
Oh, my God. I got in.

01:37:51.575 --> 01:37:53.493
- What?
- Yeah, I got in.

01:37:53.493 --> 01:37:55.537
You... That's amazing!

01:37:55.537 --> 01:37:58.123
Wait. I'm confused.
I don't understand how this happened.

01:37:58.123 --> 01:38:00.667
I was supposed to show my portfolio
in my interview.

01:38:00.667 --> 01:38:01.960
Right. Um...

01:38:02.711 --> 01:38:05.797
- I submitted a virtual deck.
- You what?

01:38:05.797 --> 01:38:08.508
Yeah, I mean, all I did was
put, like, all your stuff together,

01:38:08.508 --> 01:38:10.969
and I wrote a little personal statement
and hit "send."

01:38:12.804 --> 01:38:14.264
I mean, it was just...

01:38:20.770 --> 01:38:23.356
I can't believe
that you would do that for me.

01:38:23.356 --> 01:38:24.649
Yeah.

01:38:25.734 --> 01:38:27.277
We should have a party to celebrate.

01:38:27.277 --> 01:38:29.154
- A party?
- To celebrate, yeah.

01:38:29.154 --> 01:38:30.238
Who are you?

01:38:30.238 --> 01:38:32.824
It'll be like
a "you're awesome" party/puppy shower.

01:38:32.824 --> 01:38:34.909
Okay, where are we having this party?

01:38:36.119 --> 01:38:37.829
Here. In the apartment.

01:38:37.829 --> 01:38:39.039
Wait a second.

01:38:39.039 --> 01:38:44.502
Wait, you're telling me you are going
to have actual humans in your sanctuary?

01:38:44.502 --> 01:38:46.921
I mean, obviously they're gonna be
wearing booties and masks.

01:38:46.921 --> 01:38:50.508
No, I... Obviously
I don't think that they will.

01:38:53.303 --> 01:38:54.888
Nicole, I don't want you to move out.

01:38:56.514 --> 01:38:57.557
Then I won't.

01:39:13.698 --> 01:39:15.575
Congratulations, my darling.

01:39:15.575 --> 01:39:17.118
- Thank you, Mom.
- Oh!

01:39:17.118 --> 01:39:19.829
So we do have a no shoes
and a hand sanitizer policy.

01:39:19.829 --> 01:39:20.914
Oh.

01:39:20.914 --> 01:39:23.291
- Sounds like my kind of party.
-  I thought so.

01:39:23.291 --> 01:39:24.834
Thank you.

01:39:42.394 --> 01:39:43.770
Oh, wow.

01:40:00.662 --> 01:40:02.372
Oh, she's such a sniffer!

01:40:21.474 --> 01:40:22.517
Mm.

01:40:25.437 --> 01:40:27.188
Diane Matthews.

01:40:28.022 --> 01:40:29.566
Nicole's mother.

01:40:30.525 --> 01:40:32.902
Sid Saliba, Max's father...

01:40:33.570 --> 01:40:36.197
figure, role model and boss.

01:40:37.699 --> 01:40:38.700
Mm.

01:40:39.909 --> 01:40:44.080
That scarf is chic as shit,
a few seasons ago.

01:40:47.083 --> 01:40:51.755
But, ooh,
that nail polish is beautiful on you.

01:40:52.380 --> 01:40:53.882
Really brings your eyes out.

01:41:05.226 --> 01:41:06.853
When this party's over...

01:41:09.230 --> 01:41:11.399
take me somewhere sophisticated.

01:41:11.399 --> 01:41:12.484
Yes, ma'am.

01:42:41.489 --> 01:42:43.366
- Now? Oh, my... Ugh!
- Get the gloves out of the glove box!

01:42:43.366 --> 01:42:45.368
- Okay, okay. Wait, where are they?
- In the glove box!

01:42:45.368 --> 01:42:46.536
 Okay.

01:42:46.536 --> 01:42:49.664
They're not in here!
They're not in here. We don't have them.

01:42:49.664 --> 01:42:53.334
Okay, well, the show must go on. Okay.

01:42:54.544 --> 01:42:55.962
Delicious!

01:43:02.260 --> 01:43:04.220
Delicious.

01:43:05.638 --> 01:43:06.764
Shit.

01:43:07.515 --> 01:43:10.018
It literally smells like crotch.
It's so bad.

01:43:10.018 --> 01:43:11.853
She's still licking her hoo-ha!

01:43:11.853 --> 01:43:14.230
Well, is everything okay
with her hoo... with her hoo-ha?

01:43:14.230 --> 01:43:17.275
And can we please use...
Okay, one more time.

01:43:17.275 --> 01:43:19.402
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-ha.

01:43:19.402 --> 01:43:22.906
Stay! Good girl. Stay. Stay. Stay.

01:43:29.537 --> 01:43:32.874
- Bitch pig, huh?

01:43:32.874 --> 01:43:35.001
 Come on! You want it, you bitch pig?

01:43:35.001 --> 01:43:36.252
Come on.

01:43:36.252 --> 01:43:37.837
Let's go. All right, hold on. Huh?

01:43:37.837 --> 01:43:39.547
Who the hell you think you talkin' to?

01:43:39.547 --> 01:43:42.967
Your mother does not have a hot brother.
Oh, fuck me.

01:43:43.927 --> 01:43:45.803
You have me in my head about my teeth now.

01:43:47.138 --> 01:43:49.933
 Let us see your teeth.
Please show us your teeth.

01:43:49.933 --> 01:43:51.476
Stop.

01:43:51.476 --> 01:43:52.644
 More teeth.

01:43:53.728 --> 01:43:54.771
And cut.

01:43:57.148 --> 01:43:59.359
- Puppies! Puppies, puppies!
- Puppies! Hey, hey!

01:44:01.653 --> 01:44:04.405
Fuck! Sorry, guys. We just tooth banged.

01:44:04.405 --> 01:44:07.992
That hurt so bad. Sorry.

01:44:07.992 --> 01:44:09.077
 Let's reset.

01:44:09.077 --> 01:44:11.996
I mean, we generally do
a short consultation with the patient.

01:44:11.996 --> 01:44:13.247
What type of...

01:44:14.123 --> 01:44:16.668
- What do you need to... I'm sorry.

01:44:16.668 --> 01:44:18.628
Um...

01:44:18.628 --> 01:44:21.589
Yeah, so what kind of...
So sorry.

01:44:21.589 --> 01:44:24.133
Okay. Fuck.
