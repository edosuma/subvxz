27:27.963 --> 27:29.721
(pained groans)

27:29.874 --> 27:32.891
Try to stay still, sir.

27:33.043 --> 27:34.893
Irregular pupillary responses

27:35.045 --> 27:36.879
indicating a probable
concussion.

27:37.047 --> 27:37.988
Let's get him a C-collar

27:38.140 --> 27:39.305
and start irrigating
these wounds.

27:39.325 --> 27:41.216
Dispatch,
this is Captain Nash, 118.

27:41.235 --> 27:43.218
We've encountered a trauma
victim in transit.

27:43.311 --> 27:46.146
Looks like we won't be able
to make that RV Storage fire.

27:46.165 --> 27:47.572
There aren't any tall buildings
around here.

27:47.725 --> 27:50.225
Right, and unless that song
was based in truth,

27:50.318 --> 27:53.319
I don't think it's ever
actually raining men.

27:53.339 --> 27:56.340
(groaning)

27:58.903 --> 28:02.429
I don't think he fell
from the sky.

28:11.098 --> 28:14.507
-Ah...
-Uh...

28:14.585 --> 28:16.768
Hi.

28:16.937 --> 28:18.696
Hello.

28:18.864 --> 28:21.198
Is he gonna be okay?

28:24.595 --> 28:26.261
BOBBY:
What the hell were
you two thinking

28:26.354 --> 28:28.113
-hitching a ride up there?
-I don't know.

28:28.265 --> 28:30.374
You don't know.
What do you mean you don't know?

28:30.525 --> 28:32.784
It was just something
we always fantasized about.

28:32.878 --> 28:35.620
Having sex on top
of a firetruck.

28:35.773 --> 28:37.631
Oh, hey, like<i> Backdraft.</i>

28:39.201 --> 28:41.701
<i> Backdraft</i> was a seminal
influence on Buck's life.

28:41.721 --> 28:42.961
Sorry, poor choice of words.

28:43.113 --> 28:45.447
That has to be the dumbest,
most dangerous

28:45.466 --> 28:48.392
and dumbest fantasy
I've ever heard of.

28:48.427 --> 28:50.561
And it's not a truck,
it's an engine.

28:56.293 --> 28:58.551

29:17.998 --> 29:21.817
Hi. I'm just waiting
for Darius.

29:21.819 --> 29:24.511
It should only be
a few minutes.

29:29.251 --> 29:31.843
I feel like we got off on
the wrong foot the other night.

I'm May.

29:33.680 --> 29:35.439
Okay.

29:37.109 --> 29:38.609
Sure seems like
it could be hard

29:38.836 --> 29:40.611
to study in a house this busy.

29:40.762 --> 29:42.946
So many distractions.

29:43.098 --> 29:44.097
Uh, what's your major?

29:44.174 --> 29:45.449
I'm not a student.

29:45.676 --> 29:48.176
The need for post-secondary
education is a myth

29:48.195 --> 29:50.028
propagated to keep young people
too distracted

29:50.122 --> 29:51.604
to see what's really there.

29:51.698 --> 29:53.849
Which is?

29:53.942 --> 29:55.867
Nothing.

29:56.020 --> 29:57.352
(scoffs)

29:57.371 --> 30:00.038
Wow, that's--
That's a little bleak.

30:00.190 --> 30:01.373
So what's the point, then,

30:01.467 --> 30:03.449
if we're just living
in a void of nothingness?

30:03.469 --> 30:06.878
Because where there is nothing,
there is only room for growth.

30:07.031 --> 30:08.864
What kind of growth?

30:08.957 --> 30:11.550
You wouldn't understand.

30:11.644 --> 30:15.628
-Oh, let me help you

-I don't need your help.

30:15.648 --> 30:17.231

investigate firearm purchases,

31:47.631 --> 31:49.981
My thoughts exactly,

you need to steer clear
of this young man.

What's-what's going on?
You lost your phone?

32:02.588 --> 32:05.071
-I can-- I can call...
-No, it's not a phone.

32:05.165 --> 32:06.590
It's a book,
and it belongs to me.

32:06.708 --> 32:07.758
Sure. It's just a book.

32:07.985 --> 32:08.817
I mean, we could get you
another copy.

32:08.910 --> 32:10.510
No, there's no copy!

32:12.264 --> 32:13.931
That bitch girlfriend

32:36.847 --> 32:38.938

-Hey.

Darius won't answer.
I didn't see if

32:40.275 --> 32:41.516
he ever went inside the house,

32:41.535 --> 32:43.185
but Erik is definitely
still in there.

32:43.203 --> 32:45.203
All right, good.
Maybe Darius is

32:45.297 --> 32:47.038
still just stuck
in traffic.

32:47.132 --> 32:48.540

33:11.306 --> 33:13.323
We shut down the street
at both ends.

33:13.550 --> 33:14.974
Now, hopefully one of
the other roommates

33:14.994 --> 33:17.068
will show up and give us
the layout inside.

33:17.221 --> 33:19.387
I put in a request
for HRT and SWAT,

33:19.406 --> 33:21.389
but I'm not sure they're
gonna make it here in time.

33:21.408 --> 33:23.391
How desperate do you think
this kid is?

33:23.485 --> 33:25.727
Well, last step of his plan
was escape.

33:25.729 --> 33:28.988
Whatever he was gonna do,
seems like he was hoping

33:29.157 --> 33:30.065
to make it out alive.

33:30.083 --> 33:33.159
Oh, he was headed to Mexico.

33:33.178 --> 33:35.178
-He know we're outside?
-Unfortunately, yes.

33:35.330 --> 33:38.240
Great. So we lost the element
of surprise, too.

33:38.242 --> 33:40.242
You know, I would feel better

33:40.335 --> 33:43.762

who'd had training.

33:43.914 --> 33:46.023
He is.

33:46.250 --> 33:48.583
Erik, I am sorry
that I stole your book.

33:48.602 --> 33:51.269

So now I got a new plan.

33:57.870 --> 33:59.018
Which is?

33:59.038 --> 34:00.704
Kill your boyfriend,

34:00.931 --> 34:02.873

<i> -Huh?</i>

34:07.362 --> 34:08.712
Oh, you're offering
to take his place?

34:08.863 --> 34:10.622
The police would never
let that happen.

34:10.774 --> 34:11.940
Surprisingly honest.

-I try to be.
<i> -Oh, no, that is a lie.</i>

34:16.204 --> 34:17.946
You know, they say they want
a nice guy like me,

34:18.115 --> 34:19.056
but that's not true.

34:19.283 --> 34:20.574
What they really want is
some macho jackass

34:20.634 --> 34:22.967
to treat them like crap.
Isn't that right, pretty boy?

34:23.062 --> 34:24.619
I'm not like that, man.

34:24.638 --> 34:26.788
Darius is a good guy.

34:26.807 --> 34:28.473
He hasn't done anything to you.

34:28.642 --> 34:30.007
He doesn't deserve this.

34:30.160 --> 34:31.142
What about what I deserve?

34:31.236 --> 34:32.903
What do you think
you deserve, Erik?

34:32.979 --> 34:34.554
<i> You have my book, don't you?</i>

34:34.648 --> 34:36.314
That tells it all.

34:36.408 --> 34:37.816
Well, I'd rather get
the information

34:37.968 --> 34:39.076
straight from the source.

34:39.303 --> 34:40.635
What do you want people
to know about you?

34:40.728 --> 34:41.803
<i> I want people to know</i>

34:41.896 --> 34:43.321
that I was brave enough
to stand up

34:43.473 --> 34:46.232
against the conspiracy
to keep men down.

34:46.368 --> 34:49.235
The mainstream media
and the lies they peddle.

34:49.254 --> 34:51.646
Protecting pedophiles
and prosecuting

34:51.665 --> 34:53.148
the true heroes of this country!

34:53.241 --> 34:55.425
HRT is on the way,
but it's at least

34:55.577 --> 34:57.502
-another 20 minutes for SWAT.
-I'm not sure

34:57.596 --> 35:00.097
Darius has that much time.

35:04.919 --> 35:06.177
No way, he's spiraling.

35:06.271 --> 35:08.680
He knows that his options are
running out real soon.

35:08.832 --> 35:09.755
Why do you say that?

35:09.775 --> 35:11.108
Erik's a creep, not an idiot.

35:11.259 --> 35:13.001
But we just cannot risk
going in there

35:13.019 --> 35:15.687
without knowing
where he is.

35:15.839 --> 35:19.190
But what if we did know?
If I could get him by a window?

35:19.284 --> 35:22.101
Yeah, do it.

35:38.286 --> 35:39.586
<i> They're taking over the scene.</i>

running the show.

<i> That's bull.</i>

35:44.368 --> 35:45.700

35:58.064 --> 35:59.714
Why should I believe you?

35:59.807 --> 36:01.307
You shouldn't.

36:01.326 --> 36:03.493
<i> You're smarter than me, right?</i>

36:05.330 --> 36:08.498
Maybe you should just
take a look for yourself.

36:17.825 --> 36:19.825
You son of a bitch!

36:19.920 --> 36:23.054

It's my fault that
you were in danger

37:33.159 --> 37:34.417

37:34.569 --> 37:38.738
Don't blame yourself

took that guy down with a phone.

37:48.008 --> 37:50.767
(laughs)
Yeah, I-I had great training.

37:50.918 --> 37:52.435
It was badass.

37:52.662 --> 37:55.254
You know I wouldn't blame you
if you had second thoughts

37:55.274 --> 37:57.181
-about moving back here.
-Are you kidding?

37:57.350 --> 37:58.817
Look, I've realized
that there's no place

37:58.926 --> 38:01.403
I'd rather be than here.

38:03.949 --> 38:06.283
(May chuckles)

38:13.683 --> 38:14.699
(goat bleating)

38:14.851 --> 38:17.127
(whooping)

38:18.522 --> 38:20.130
Aah!

38:20.206 --> 38:22.948
You know, I thought this place
was gonna be lame,

38:22.968 --> 38:24.968
but it's actually
kind of cool.

38:25.119 --> 38:27.211
Since when do I take you
to lame places?

38:27.364 --> 38:30.198
The dentist, the doctor, school.

38:30.291 --> 38:32.867
(chuckles)
You're an ungrateful child.

38:32.960 --> 38:36.104
-Can I get a turkey leg?
-Yeah.

38:37.482 --> 38:39.649
Here, get three.

38:39.801 --> 38:41.376
And bring back two.

38:41.469 --> 38:43.394
Look, swords.

38:43.547 --> 38:47.549
Now, rise,
Dame Dottie the Dutiful.

38:47.642 --> 38:49.551
Dutiful?

38:49.644 --> 38:50.735
I know I'm a knight now,

38:50.829 --> 38:51.995
but can't it be
something different?

38:52.146 --> 38:54.313
Like Dottie the Magnificent?

38:54.333 --> 38:55.332
It's your fantasy.

38:55.483 --> 38:57.058
It can be whatever
you want it to be.

38:57.077 --> 38:59.652
Heroes come in all
shapes and sizes.

38:59.671 --> 39:01.563
ALL:
Huzzah!

39:01.656 --> 39:04.049
(cheering)

39:05.177 --> 39:07.159
Oh, hey, uh,
what do you think?

39:07.179 --> 39:09.662
-Uh, it's a little small
for you.
-Uh-huh.

39:09.756 --> 39:10.830
It's for Jee-Yun.

39:10.924 --> 39:12.849
Oh. Your sister's
gonna kill you.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.834
That's what being an uncle
is all about.

39:14.853 --> 39:16.260
No, I just--

39:16.413 --> 39:19.080
I figured it's never too soon
for her to learn

39:19.173 --> 39:20.915
that girls can be heroes, too.

39:21.008 --> 39:23.342
Facts. You should probably
get her

39:23.436 --> 39:26.011
-one of these little
shields, too.
-Yes.

39:26.180 --> 39:28.198
-How 'bout this one right here?
-There you go.

39:28.349 --> 39:29.757
-Oh, oh. You're in, huh?
-Don't come for me.

39:29.926 --> 39:31.259
-Don't come for me!
-You're in. Come on, come on!

39:31.352 --> 39:33.370
Good to see you back
on your feet, sir.

39:33.597 --> 39:35.613
No kidding. Don't know how
this whole operation

39:35.707 --> 39:37.281
didn't fall apart without me.

39:37.434 --> 39:39.000
Right.

39:40.236 --> 39:43.121
My letter of resignation.
No offense, but

39:43.215 --> 39:45.289
working for you
is just too stressful.

39:45.442 --> 39:47.717
I understand. Not everyone's
built for my pace.

39:47.944 --> 39:49.969
There's one more thing.

39:51.131 --> 39:52.964
A letter of recommendation.

39:53.116 --> 39:54.707
I was hoping
you would sign it.

39:54.726 --> 39:57.060
"He's a real lifesaver"?

39:57.896 --> 40:00.397
Hand me a pen.

40:09.466 --> 40:11.315
RITA:
How long do we have?

40:11.392 --> 40:13.410
They said they were
releasing me after lunch.

40:13.561 --> 40:15.453
Good.

40:19.400 --> 40:22.919
That should be more
than enough time.

40:24.164 --> 40:26.314
-(TV playing)
-You know what? You're right.

40:26.407 --> 40:28.091
This does feel like
a movie theater.

40:28.318 --> 40:30.168
CHIMNEY:
And the snacks are
so much cheaper.

40:30.336 --> 40:31.744
(Maddie laughs)

40:31.763 --> 40:33.337
So how long are we gonna
be able to convince ourselves

40:33.432 --> 40:35.765
that this is a sustainable
way to live?

40:35.917 --> 40:37.583
As long as we need to.

40:37.602 --> 40:41.479
When the right dream house
presents itself, we'll know.

40:43.925 --> 40:45.850
But in the meantime,

40:46.002 --> 40:48.236
this is a pretty great
fantasy, too.

40:50.598 --> 40:51.781
-Oh.
-Oh...

40:51.933 --> 40:53.766
You see it? You see it?

40:53.860 --> 40:55.785
-It's so cute.
-Oh, that is so cute.

40:56.012 --> 40:58.696
How can you not think
that's cute?

40:59.458 --> 41:01.958
CARLA:
So how long do you plan
on standing guard out here?

41:02.151 --> 41:04.185
Just until they get inside.

41:04.278 --> 41:06.704
And we can hang out
in the car after.

41:06.873 --> 41:08.447
It's a chaperoned school
function.

41:08.467 --> 41:11.359
He's not shipping out
for a year-long tour.

41:11.377 --> 41:12.360
(both laugh)

41:12.529 --> 41:13.786
When you know
you're having kids,

41:13.880 --> 41:15.196
you have all these expectations

41:15.289 --> 41:16.698
of what life's gonna
be like, you know?

41:16.791 --> 41:18.199
The milestones.

41:18.292 --> 41:21.703
The first words,
first steps...

41:21.796 --> 41:23.538
First crush.

41:23.556 --> 41:25.064
(laughs)

41:26.467 --> 41:30.211
Then they tell you your kid's
gonna be different,

41:30.304 --> 41:33.323
and he's gonna have challenges
other kids don't.

41:33.474 --> 41:37.142
They warn you to manage
your expectations.

41:37.162 --> 41:39.829
All those milestones
start to seem like

41:39.981 --> 41:40.997
a stupid fantasy.

41:41.224 --> 41:42.907
CARLA:
Looks like that fantasy's

41:43.059 --> 41:45.484
turning into a reality.

41:45.504 --> 41:47.562
(sighs)

41:47.580 --> 41:48.988
How's that feel?

41:49.065 --> 41:51.991
-Pretty damn good.
-(Carla chuckles)

41:52.010 --> 41:54.235
Yeah. Well, the school says

41:54.328 --> 41:56.346
this is gonna last three hours.

41:56.497 --> 41:57.830
Hmm.

41:57.924 --> 42:00.499
Wait, wait, are you calling
for a ride home, 'cause...

42:00.519 --> 42:03.502
And miss this milestone?
Hell no. (chuckles)

42:03.522 --> 42:06.564
I'm ordering takeout.
How you feel about dim sum?

42:08.342 --> 42:09.751
(both laugh)

42:09.919 --> 42:11.510
BOBBY:
With everything May
and Darius have been through,

42:11.530 --> 42:14.489
I don't mind waiting
for dinner, but how much longer?

42:16.109 --> 42:19.702
I think they're almost done.

42:19.929 --> 42:20.870
How are you feeling
about all this?

42:21.097 --> 42:23.447
Seeing my daughter
safe and happy

42:23.542 --> 42:26.042
is a dream come true.

42:26.193 --> 42:29.937
There is nothing quite like
being young and in love.

42:29.956 --> 42:32.473
Or just in love.

42:32.533 --> 42:34.092
Mm.
