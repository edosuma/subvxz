[theme music]

00:10.178 --> 00:11.112
Jackie!

00:11.145 --> 00:13.081
Are you in there?

00:13.114 --> 00:14.215
JACKIE: Roseanne?

00:14.248 --> 00:16.684
I've been sitting there
honking for 20 minutes.

00:16.717 --> 00:17.885
What's your problem?

00:17.918 --> 00:18.919
Oh, the swap meet!

00:18.952 --> 00:19.820
Right.

00:19.853 --> 00:22.890
I'll be right there.

00:22.923 --> 00:24.058
God, your door's open.

00:24.092 --> 00:25.093
Talk about desperate.

00:28.062 --> 00:29.497
Ziggy!

00:29.530 --> 00:30.464
Rosie!

00:30.498 --> 00:33.367
Hey!

00:33.401 --> 00:34.368
You big jerk!

00:34.402 --> 00:35.736
How long have you been here?

00:35.769 --> 00:37.105
- I just got in last night.
- Ow!

00:37.138 --> 00:38.005
Ow!

00:38.038 --> 00:39.907
You're on my leg.

00:39.940 --> 00:41.942
Hey, this is
incredible because we

00:41.975 --> 00:43.544
were just talking about you?
- Yeah?

00:43.577 --> 00:44.945
Yeah.

00:44.978 --> 00:47.248
Me and Dan were watching this
James Cagney movie, you know?

00:47.281 --> 00:49.517
And just as they were taking
him down the hall to the prison,

00:49.550 --> 00:52.486
you know, to get electrocuted,
out of nowhere, Dan goes,

00:52.520 --> 00:54.655
I wonder what Ziggy's up to?

00:54.688 --> 00:57.658
Do we all have
to be in the bed?

00:57.691 --> 00:58.559
Come on.

00:58.592 --> 00:59.560
Let's go to our house.

00:59.593 --> 01:00.894
Dan will freak out
when he sees you.

01:00.928 --> 01:02.163
All right.
Just let me get dressed.

01:04.832 --> 01:05.633
We're done here, right?

01:11.139 --> 01:12.973
Jackie, What are you
doing sleeping with Ziggy?

01:13.006 --> 01:13.807
I--

01:13.841 --> 01:14.375
Haven't you learned anything?

01:14.408 --> 01:15.476
Go away.

01:15.509 --> 01:16.377
Wow.

01:16.410 --> 01:17.978
Isn't he married or something?

01:18.011 --> 01:20.448
He was living with
a girl, and she threw

01:20.481 --> 01:22.416
him out over a year ago, OK?

01:22.450 --> 01:23.617
Take a hint, Jackie.

01:23.651 --> 01:24.918
I don't wanna
talk about it now.

01:24.952 --> 01:27.087
We'll talk about it
at the swap meet.

01:27.121 --> 01:30.791
I'm not going to any stupid
swap meet when Ziggy's here.

01:30.824 --> 01:32.560
ZIGGY: Let's motor.

01:32.593 --> 01:34.562
Hey, Jacks, you coming?

01:34.595 --> 01:39.867
Yeah, I'll be along,
soon as I find my dignity.

01:39.900 --> 01:41.135
Cool.

01:41.169 --> 01:45.105
So Ziggy, you seeing anybody?

01:45.139 --> 01:48.509
[theme music]

02:38.592 --> 02:41.829
So then I hooked up with
a rodeo for a couple weeks.

02:41.862 --> 02:44.598
The Zig man rode
the Brahma bull.

02:44.632 --> 02:45.766
No way.

02:45.799 --> 02:46.667
Absolutely.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.168
Three seconds on the bull.

02:48.202 --> 02:51.605
Two hours on the
operating table.

02:51.639 --> 02:53.907
Why the hell would you
do something like that?

02:53.941 --> 02:56.510
Dan, the Spanish
have a word for it.

02:56.544 --> 02:57.545
What is it again?

02:57.578 --> 02:58.446
Macho?

02:58.479 --> 02:59.613
Machismo?

02:59.647 --> 03:00.514
Tequila.

03:00.548 --> 03:01.982
That's the one.

03:02.015 --> 03:02.883
DAN: Maniac.

03:02.916 --> 03:05.219
Pass me the wrench.

03:05.253 --> 03:06.119
OK, man.

03:06.153 --> 03:07.355
Your turn now.

03:07.388 --> 03:08.589
What you been up to?

03:08.622 --> 03:10.591
Oh, you know, not much.

03:10.624 --> 03:11.492
Kids are good.

03:11.525 --> 03:14.562
Rosie's great.

03:14.595 --> 03:15.463
Paying the bills.

03:15.496 --> 03:16.597
Yeah?

03:16.630 --> 03:17.998
So what do you do for
an adventure, you know?

03:18.031 --> 03:20.701
A little danger?

03:20.734 --> 03:23.737
Paying the bills.

03:23.771 --> 03:25.539
Jeez.

03:25.573 --> 03:28.008
How'd you ever make it
across country on this thing?

03:28.041 --> 03:28.909
Oh, I didn't.

03:28.942 --> 03:30.778
I just bought this bike, man.

03:30.811 --> 03:34.315
I sold the one I was riding to
some doctor for like, 20 grand.

03:34.348 --> 03:35.148
20 grand.

03:38.486 --> 03:42.456
Did I tell you I just dry
walled the space shuttle?

03:42.490 --> 03:43.357
You don't believe me?

03:43.391 --> 03:44.625
Oh, of course I believe you.

03:44.658 --> 03:46.660
You say you sold the bike
to a doctor for 20 grand.

03:46.694 --> 03:48.128
Why shouldn't I believe you?

03:48.161 --> 03:53.634
I just-- woof.

03:53.667 --> 03:56.804
See, I find these classic
bikes that are trashed.

03:56.837 --> 03:58.138
I cherry them out.

03:58.171 --> 04:01.342
Then when I'm low on cash, I
sell them to like, dentists

04:01.375 --> 04:03.277
who think they're bikers.

04:03.311 --> 04:05.846
Oh, man, that's stuff we
used to dream about doing

04:05.879 --> 04:07.147
when we were growing up.

04:07.180 --> 04:10.551
I couldn't wait that long.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.353
Dad, I'm going to the mall--

04:12.386 --> 04:14.254
oh, is that ours?

04:18.091 --> 04:19.527
No, it's Ziggy's.

04:19.560 --> 04:20.361
Daddy!

04:23.864 --> 04:26.600
Beat it, Darlene.

04:26.634 --> 04:27.768
Say goodbye, Darlene.

04:27.801 --> 04:29.202
Oh, bye-bye!

04:33.273 --> 04:35.543
Dan, listen, I don't want
her thinking I got this selling

04:35.576 --> 04:36.977
drugs or something.
- No sweat.

04:37.010 --> 04:38.111
I'll tell her you robbed a bank.

04:38.145 --> 04:40.348
ZIGGY: Thanks, man.

04:40.381 --> 04:41.515
So how are your kids?

04:41.549 --> 04:42.416
Oh, they're fine.

04:42.450 --> 04:45.152
They're with their father now.

04:45.185 --> 04:47.455
Huh?

04:47.488 --> 04:50.257
Well, they were Jill's kids.
She kicked him out.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.759
I moved in.
She kicked me out.

04:51.792 --> 04:52.660
He moved back.

04:52.693 --> 04:55.128
I figured, hey, that's life.

04:55.162 --> 04:58.065
Only yours, Ziggy.

04:58.098 --> 05:00.133
I tell you, Dan.

05:00.167 --> 05:02.002
Left a piece of my
heart in her trailer.

05:07.341 --> 05:08.241
Want another brew?

05:08.275 --> 05:09.076
Sure.

05:12.380 --> 05:13.246
Peace of my heart?

05:16.183 --> 05:19.587
I left a piece of my heart
in her trailer, (SINGING)

05:19.620 --> 05:23.824
a chunk of my soul
in her mobile home.

05:23.857 --> 05:27.995
I left a piece of my
heart in her trailer,

05:28.028 --> 05:30.197
now I'm a-ridin'
the road all alone.

05:30.230 --> 05:31.031
Yee-haw!

05:35.102 --> 05:38.205
No, he's a friend
of my parents.

05:38.238 --> 05:40.273
He's so cute.

05:40.307 --> 05:43.777
OK, well, like, picture
Mark, but more mature.

05:43.811 --> 05:45.245
Yeah.

05:45.278 --> 05:46.346
No, I don't know.

05:46.380 --> 05:47.815
It's like he's got this
thing with his eyes

05:47.848 --> 05:48.749
like he knows stuff.

05:48.782 --> 05:49.650
Hey, Beck.

05:49.683 --> 05:52.319
[scream]

05:52.352 --> 05:53.587
I gotta go, Tina.

05:53.621 --> 05:55.589
I wasn't talking about you.

05:55.623 --> 05:57.591
Were so.

05:57.625 --> 05:58.492
Hey.

05:58.526 --> 05:59.593
What's going on?

05:59.627 --> 06:00.661
Becky's got a crush on me.

06:00.694 --> 06:03.631
I do not!

06:03.664 --> 06:04.998
Digs my eyes.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.900
Well, red always was
her favorite color.

06:09.870 --> 06:11.439
I got to go.

06:11.472 --> 06:13.774
You sure you don't
want me to come with you?

06:13.807 --> 06:14.608
Oh, God.

06:18.078 --> 06:19.713
That was fun.

06:19.747 --> 06:20.914
Well, don't get all cocky.

06:20.948 --> 06:23.684
She's easy to humiliate.

06:23.717 --> 06:26.086
I have to ask you something, OK?

06:26.119 --> 06:27.788
You might think it's
weird, but I want to know.

06:27.821 --> 06:30.924
What are your
intentions with Jackie?

06:30.958 --> 06:33.060
Intentions?

06:33.093 --> 06:34.294
Gee, I don't know, Mrs. Conner.

06:34.327 --> 06:35.829
I was just going to take
her to the sock hop,

06:35.863 --> 06:37.965
see if I could score.

06:37.998 --> 06:40.601
'Cause you know she's had a
really rough year, you know?

06:40.634 --> 06:43.571
She lost her job and
she lost her fiance,

06:43.604 --> 06:44.805
and now here's Ziggy again.

06:44.838 --> 06:45.706
All right.

06:45.739 --> 06:46.607
She's making a comeback.

06:49.209 --> 06:50.410
I know you, Ziggy.

06:50.444 --> 06:52.345
In a couple of days, you'll
catch the first cocktail

06:52.379 --> 06:53.346
waitress out of here.

06:53.380 --> 06:54.414
Aw, come on, Rosie.

06:54.448 --> 06:56.083
What's with the
big sister thing?

06:56.116 --> 06:56.984
You were right, man.

06:57.017 --> 06:57.885
The start's dead.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.419
Let's go pick up a new one.

06:59.453 --> 07:00.253
You got it.

07:02.155 --> 07:03.323
We done?

07:03.356 --> 07:04.492
Well, you tell me.

07:07.227 --> 07:08.095
Hey, it'll be cool.

07:08.128 --> 07:09.296
Don't worry.

07:09.329 --> 07:10.731
What'll be cool?

07:10.764 --> 07:12.165
Me and Rosie are
running away together.

07:12.199 --> 07:13.066
Oh, Right.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.836
Like I'd give up Raul for you.

07:15.869 --> 07:19.172
[music playing]

07:23.276 --> 07:24.612
HUMPHREY BOGART (ON
TV): Maybe not today.

07:24.645 --> 07:25.879
Maybe not tomorrow.
But soon.

07:25.913 --> 07:28.348
And for the rest of your life.

07:28.381 --> 07:29.983
INGRID BERGMAN (ON
TV): What about us?

07:30.017 --> 07:31.619
HUMPHREY BOGART (ON TV):
We'll always have Paris.

07:31.652 --> 07:32.686
Meh.

07:32.720 --> 07:33.987
This is where the
movie totally loses it.

07:34.021 --> 07:35.255
You're kidding me.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.124
This is the best part.

07:37.157 --> 07:39.459
There's no way she's going to
get on a plane with that guy.

07:39.493 --> 07:40.728
Of course she would.

07:40.761 --> 07:41.895
Nah.

07:41.929 --> 07:43.096
Bogart's way cooler.

07:43.130 --> 07:46.133
That guy never even made
another movie again.

07:46.166 --> 07:48.869
That guy is only the
leader of the resistance.

07:48.902 --> 07:51.404
If she doesn't go with him,
France may never be free.

07:51.438 --> 07:52.806
Ha.
Yeah, right.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.174
Like anybody cares about France.

07:57.277 --> 08:00.080
Um, Ma, I need money
for school supplies.

08:00.113 --> 08:00.981
How much?

08:01.014 --> 08:02.349
Oh-- 25 bucks.

08:05.586 --> 08:07.921
Get over yourself.

08:07.955 --> 08:08.922
Well, how about 15?

08:11.659 --> 08:13.260
You do your own damn homework.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.165
Fine.

08:18.198 --> 08:21.334
I hear eighth grade is a lot
easier the second time around.

08:21.368 --> 08:23.070
Hey, all.

08:23.103 --> 08:24.337
Hey, where were you guys?

08:24.371 --> 08:25.505
- Lenny's Bike Shop.
- Yeah.

08:25.539 --> 08:26.940
Hanging out.

08:26.974 --> 08:27.841
You know.

08:27.875 --> 08:29.142
Being like Mark,
but more mature.

08:31.879 --> 08:33.313
I wasn't talking about you!

08:33.346 --> 08:34.147
God.

08:37.585 --> 08:40.721
So, Jackie,
think I could crash

08:40.754 --> 08:41.955
at your place for a while?

08:41.989 --> 08:42.856
Ziggy!

08:42.890 --> 08:46.660
He's talking to me, Roseanne.

08:46.694 --> 08:47.761
How long is a while?

08:47.795 --> 08:48.696
Well, I don't know.

08:48.729 --> 08:50.130
See, it looks like
I may be having

08:50.163 --> 08:51.999
my own business here in town.

08:52.032 --> 08:52.966
[snickers]

08:53.000 --> 08:55.168
I'm buying Lenny's Bike Shop.

08:55.202 --> 08:56.704
You're kidding me.

08:56.737 --> 08:57.805
No way, man.

08:57.838 --> 09:00.608
I tell you-- me and
Dan went down to pick

09:00.641 --> 09:01.975
up some parts this afternoon--

09:02.009 --> 09:04.377
Lenny is looking to retire--

09:04.411 --> 09:07.347
so the Zig man
made him an offer.

09:07.380 --> 09:08.816
It was so cool.

09:08.849 --> 09:11.151
When Ziggy pulled that
wad out of his pocket,

09:11.184 --> 09:14.554
Lenny kissed him
right on the lips.

09:14.588 --> 09:15.522
Ick.

09:15.555 --> 09:19.226
So, uh, Jacks,
you want a roommate?

09:19.259 --> 09:24.197
Hm, well, you'd have
to pay half the rent,

09:24.231 --> 09:27.167
half the utilities,
and you bring your own

09:27.200 --> 09:31.271
laundry over to Roseanne's.

09:31.304 --> 09:33.974
Deal.

09:34.007 --> 09:35.442
Hey, I hope you
guys know I was

09:35.475 --> 09:39.613
totally for this relationship
from the beginning.

09:39.647 --> 09:40.848
I think it's just awesome.

09:40.881 --> 09:42.082
I think it's great because--

09:42.115 --> 09:44.952
OK-- like, there's only
one bike shop in town.

09:44.985 --> 09:46.253
Nobody knows more
about bikes than him.

09:46.286 --> 09:47.220
Right.

09:47.254 --> 09:48.822
I think this might
be a great idea.

09:48.856 --> 09:50.357
Did you think of it yourself?

09:50.390 --> 09:54.094
I mean, it's almost
like you have a clue.

09:54.127 --> 09:56.764
I knew you'd be proud of us.

09:56.797 --> 09:57.665
Us?

09:57.698 --> 09:58.531
Yeah, me and Dan.

10:06.640 --> 10:07.675
Honey, I-- I--

10:07.708 --> 10:08.942
I know it's new.

10:08.976 --> 10:10.644
It's a little scary.

10:10.678 --> 10:11.979
But it doesn't have
to be, you know,

10:12.012 --> 10:15.683
like how we fought when I
started the drywall business.

10:15.716 --> 10:17.918
[nervous laugh] You didn't
want any part of that,

10:17.951 --> 10:19.252
and we fought like
cats and dogs.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.963
[music playing]

10:35.903 --> 10:37.270
Dan, Rosie.

10:37.304 --> 10:38.505
Good to see you.
How are you?

10:38.538 --> 10:39.572
Hi, Doug.
How's Lois?

10:39.606 --> 10:41.274
Good.
Everyone's great.

10:41.308 --> 10:42.209
How you doing, buddy?

10:42.242 --> 10:43.276
Hey, how you doing, man?
I'm--

10:43.310 --> 10:44.177
Norbert.

10:44.211 --> 10:45.078
Norbert Walsh.

10:45.112 --> 10:47.247
Take that thing off your head.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.148
Doug.

10:48.181 --> 10:49.616
Please, sit down.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.819
We missed you last week
over at the lodge, Dougie.

10:51.852 --> 10:52.720
Yeah.

10:52.753 --> 10:54.087
It was the kid's birthday.

10:54.121 --> 10:55.422
Had to do that
miniature golf thing.

10:55.455 --> 10:56.957
You know?
- Oh, yeah.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.158
How old is she now?

10:58.191 --> 10:59.760
Would you believe she
was eight years old?

10:59.793 --> 11:00.660
No!

11:00.694 --> 11:01.561
That-- that's--

11:01.594 --> 11:02.462
It's amazing.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.497
They grow up so fast.

11:04.531 --> 11:05.332
So what about the money?

11:09.636 --> 11:11.604
Well, you know, from what
you told me on the phone,

11:11.638 --> 11:13.606
I think it sounds
real promising.

11:13.640 --> 11:15.776
So what I did, I checked
into Lenny's shop.

11:15.809 --> 11:17.110
And, actually, it's going OK.

11:17.144 --> 11:18.712
How OK is OK?

11:18.746 --> 11:20.513
Be straight with us now, Doug.

11:20.547 --> 11:24.852
Are we all going to be eating
cat food, or just the kids?

11:24.885 --> 11:26.286
Well, Lenny's been
looking to get out,

11:26.319 --> 11:27.988
so he may have slipped
off a little bit.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.356
But who knows?

11:29.389 --> 11:31.859
With some fresh blood in there,
anything can happen, right?

11:31.892 --> 11:33.460
And the bank has always
been behind you and Dan.

11:33.493 --> 11:34.928
You know that.
- Thanks, Doug.

11:34.962 --> 11:36.163
Sure.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.198
So, want to tell me a little
about your partner here?

11:38.231 --> 11:39.767
BOTH: No.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.935
Hey, uh-- man, don't
make him think I'm some

11:41.969 --> 11:43.771
kind of irresponsible guy.

11:43.804 --> 11:46.339
I happen to have 20
grand in my shoe.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.809
You don't-- you don't
need to see that, do you?

11:48.842 --> 11:49.843
No.

11:49.877 --> 11:51.278
No, but he is going
to need another 30

11:51.311 --> 11:52.645
for the down payment.

11:52.679 --> 11:55.648
Well, I was thinking about
selling the drywall business.

11:55.682 --> 11:57.985
No, Dan.
You are the drywall business.

11:58.018 --> 12:01.889
I mean, without you,
there's nothing to sell.

12:01.922 --> 12:03.590
You got any other ideas?

12:03.623 --> 12:04.792
Yeah.

12:04.825 --> 12:07.560
We could give you a second
mortgage on the house.

12:07.594 --> 12:09.229
The house?

12:09.262 --> 12:10.263
Listen, not to worry.

12:10.297 --> 12:11.398
We'll get you a good rate.

12:11.431 --> 12:12.499
And this way, my
boss will really

12:12.532 --> 12:14.534
know you're serious about it.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.370
[sighs] The house.

12:17.404 --> 12:18.872
That the only way, Doug?

12:18.906 --> 12:21.408
That's the only
way I can see, Danny.

12:21.441 --> 12:22.509
Sorry, Zig.

12:22.542 --> 12:23.443
Oh, man--

12:23.476 --> 12:24.711
Ziggy, I'm going
to be carrying

12:24.744 --> 12:26.313
two mortgages, a business loan.

12:26.346 --> 12:29.917
I don't know when the money
is going to start coming in.

12:29.950 --> 12:31.051
I can't risk it.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.519
I got a family.
- So what are you going to do?

12:32.552 --> 12:34.721
You gonna spend the rest of your
life doing something you hate?

12:34.754 --> 12:36.256
- I don't hate it.
- Oh, get off it, man!

12:36.289 --> 12:37.624
What was all that
about yesterday

12:37.657 --> 12:39.626
about how bored you are and
how you hate going off to work?

12:39.659 --> 12:40.527
Forget it, Zig.

12:40.560 --> 12:41.528
It's not going to happen.

12:41.561 --> 12:43.063
Well, then I'm
going to do it myself.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.565
What do I need to do
this thing myself?

12:45.598 --> 12:47.034
What do you got
in the other shoe?

12:51.171 --> 12:51.972
OK.

12:54.774 --> 12:55.708
Let's do it.

12:55.742 --> 12:57.210
Let's put up the house.

12:57.244 --> 12:58.545
What are you talking about?

12:58.578 --> 13:01.714
Well-- pfft.
You want to do it?

13:01.748 --> 13:03.817
Let's do it.

13:03.851 --> 13:05.886
Are you sure?

13:05.919 --> 13:07.454
Well, he says he
believes in you.

13:07.487 --> 13:08.355
I don't know.

13:08.388 --> 13:09.622
You know, I guess I should, too.

13:16.196 --> 13:17.364
Now if you'll
excuse me, I'm just

13:17.397 --> 13:21.601
going to step outside and puke.

13:21.634 --> 13:24.504
[music playing]

13:33.046 --> 13:34.314
You OK, Rosie?

13:34.347 --> 13:35.715
Yeah-- yeah.

13:35.748 --> 13:38.919
I-- I-- I just want
to sit in my house,

13:38.952 --> 13:40.954
you know, while it's still mine.

13:40.988 --> 13:42.022
So, what?

13:42.055 --> 13:42.923
What?

13:42.956 --> 13:44.157
Did you get the loan or--

13:44.191 --> 13:45.425
Yes!

13:45.458 --> 13:48.561
Thanks to Ms. Roseanne
Conner, ladies and gentlemen!

13:48.595 --> 13:50.363
We took a second
mortgage on the house.

13:50.397 --> 13:53.366
Roseanne has certain
lingering doubts.

13:53.400 --> 13:56.403
I want to do it anymore.

13:56.436 --> 13:57.637
Come on, Rosie.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.106
It's a great idea.

13:59.139 --> 14:01.074
I believe in this idea.

14:01.108 --> 14:02.442
Well, Ziggy.

14:02.475 --> 14:04.111
You used to believe you could
see yourself sleeping if you

14:04.144 --> 14:05.212
just woke up fast enough.

14:09.516 --> 14:13.120
And I've never
been proven wrong.

14:13.153 --> 14:16.089
God, I'm going
to miss this place.

14:16.123 --> 14:16.990
Come on, you guys!

14:17.024 --> 14:17.891
Let's go celebrate!

14:17.925 --> 14:18.926
Zig, Zig, I think--

14:18.959 --> 14:20.193
I think me and Rosie
need to be alone.

14:20.227 --> 14:21.561
OK.
Come on.

14:21.594 --> 14:22.729
Come on, Zig.

14:22.762 --> 14:25.632
Rosie, you are my hero!

14:25.665 --> 14:28.035
I will never forget this.

14:28.068 --> 14:30.870
I'm never going to let you.

14:30.904 --> 14:32.605
Dan, you're in charge
of taking this lady out,

14:32.639 --> 14:35.475
showing her a good time, so
she can get out of this mood.

14:35.508 --> 14:38.045
Zig, in 5 or 10 years when
the bank's off our back,

14:38.078 --> 14:40.513
we'll be ready to celebrate.

14:40.547 --> 14:42.983
Meantime, I just
want to stay in here

14:43.016 --> 14:45.885
and concentrate on how to
arrange the furniture out

14:45.919 --> 14:48.989
on the sidewalk.
- Come on, Zig.

14:49.022 --> 14:50.223
I'll celebrate with ya.

14:50.257 --> 14:51.124
OK.

14:51.158 --> 14:52.559
OK, come on, guys!

14:52.592 --> 14:54.127
This is a good thing.

14:54.161 --> 14:55.028
Get happy!

14:55.062 --> 14:55.862
Later, Norbert.

15:02.569 --> 15:06.306
[laughs] Well,
you're welcome, too.

15:06.339 --> 15:07.674
That was nothing.

15:07.707 --> 15:11.178
The official thank you will take
place in the thank you room.

15:14.714 --> 15:19.019
What, it's no longer
the begging room?

15:19.052 --> 15:21.421
[music playing]

15:24.457 --> 15:25.358
[door shutting]

15:37.704 --> 15:38.771
ZIGGY: Guys, I
gotta talk to you.

15:38.805 --> 15:39.706
ROSEANNE: Ziggy!

15:39.739 --> 15:40.273
DAN AND ROSEANNE:
Get outta here!

15:43.510 --> 15:46.079
I got a change in plans,
so we oughta discuss it.

15:50.617 --> 15:51.951
God, Ziggy.

15:51.985 --> 15:54.287
Don't go into somebody's bedroom
in the middle of the night!

15:54.321 --> 15:56.356
You did it to me and Jackie.

15:56.389 --> 15:57.490
That's different.

15:57.524 --> 15:58.591
It was funny when I did it.

16:01.861 --> 16:04.197
What do you want, Zig?

16:04.231 --> 16:09.669
Dan, I can't go through
with the, uh, bike shop.

16:09.702 --> 16:11.271
You're kidding.

16:11.304 --> 16:12.705
I thought we were
just going to hang

16:12.739 --> 16:14.174
out and fix bikes, you know?

16:14.207 --> 16:15.208
No big deal.

16:15.242 --> 16:17.944
You know, we get
tired of it, we bail.

16:17.977 --> 16:22.382
Wait-- uh-- man, I've been
thinking all night about this.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.884
You put the house
on the line, man.

16:24.917 --> 16:27.320
I don't want that riding on me.

16:27.354 --> 16:29.089
What did you start this for?

16:29.122 --> 16:30.957
For you, man.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.459
You were bored.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.161
When I thought of this
idea, you should have seen

16:34.194 --> 16:35.995
the look on your face, man.

16:36.029 --> 16:37.830
I mean, that was
worth the 20 grand.

16:37.864 --> 16:40.633
But it-- it just
all got too big.

16:40.667 --> 16:41.834
What did you expect?

16:41.868 --> 16:43.503
We're starting a business,
not throwing a party.

16:43.536 --> 16:45.338
I know, I know.

16:45.372 --> 16:47.540
No, no, no, man.

16:47.574 --> 16:50.043
You don't come blowing in
here, getting everybody crazy.

16:50.077 --> 16:51.978
You don't start something
you're not going to finish.

16:52.011 --> 16:54.214
Well, that's why
I'm not starting this.

16:54.247 --> 16:55.248
Fine.

16:55.282 --> 16:56.916
Dan-- hey, Dan.
Come on, man.

16:56.949 --> 16:58.285
Dan, I'm sorry.
Listen.

16:58.318 --> 17:00.387
But we-- we could have gone
under in six months and you

17:00.420 --> 17:03.123
lose the house and
the drywall deal.

17:03.156 --> 17:04.824
And it was my idea, man.

17:04.857 --> 17:07.026
I mean, you guys are
going to hate me forever.

17:07.060 --> 17:08.795
This way, hey, you hate
me for a couple of months

17:08.828 --> 17:10.097
and I'm back by Christmas.

17:13.166 --> 17:14.434
No, I don't think so.

17:14.467 --> 17:15.368
Hey, Dan.

17:15.402 --> 17:18.471
We go back a long way.

17:18.505 --> 17:19.372
No.

17:19.406 --> 17:20.640
No, I'm too old for this crap.

17:20.673 --> 17:22.309
Come on.
Come on, man.

17:22.342 --> 17:23.143
You know the way out.

17:32.419 --> 17:34.053
What did Jackie say?

17:34.087 --> 17:36.723
Ah, she said a lot of things.

17:36.756 --> 17:38.725
But bottom line
was, uh, goodbye.

17:38.758 --> 17:42.129
By Sorry, Rosie.

17:45.565 --> 17:49.302
Well, I'm going to go
be with my husband now.

17:49.336 --> 17:50.903
It really is better this way.

17:55.208 --> 17:57.510
Yeah, I'm sure he'll realize
that tomorrow when he's

17:57.544 --> 17:58.878
drywalling somebody's basement.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.788
[music playing]

18:15.795 --> 18:17.964
What's your problem?

18:17.997 --> 18:20.467
I got nothing to do.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.835
Well, why don't you call
up that Todd or Troy--

18:22.869 --> 18:24.637
whatever his name is--

18:24.671 --> 18:27.574
next door and see if
he'll play with you.

18:27.607 --> 18:28.875
He's in school.

18:28.908 --> 18:29.676
Oh.

18:39.852 --> 18:40.987
How come you're not in school?

18:47.494 --> 18:48.261
Go to school!

18:53.733 --> 18:58.338
Well, at least you can't
say as you're surprised.

18:58.371 --> 18:59.406
Yeah.

18:59.439 --> 19:02.242
Well, at least we
didn't get in too deep.

19:02.275 --> 19:04.010
I'll just call Doug down
at the bank and tell him

19:04.043 --> 19:06.379
we decided to back off.

19:06.413 --> 19:07.847
BECKY: I'm going to be
home late for school.

19:07.880 --> 19:08.815
I'm going to Mark's.

19:08.848 --> 19:10.450
Hey, you've got
finals to study for.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.552
You shouldn't be
going over to Mark's.

19:12.585 --> 19:13.486
Oh, did I say Mark's?

19:13.520 --> 19:15.488
I meant the library.

19:15.522 --> 19:16.323
That's better.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.828
I actually prefer it
when she lies to me.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.266
You know what I don't get?

19:26.299 --> 19:28.868
I just don't get-- how come it
was such a good idea when Ziggy

19:28.901 --> 19:31.037
was involved, and now
it's not a good idea

19:31.070 --> 19:32.372
when he's not involved?

19:32.405 --> 19:34.574
Well, for one thing, it's
at least a two-man operation.

19:34.607 --> 19:35.908
I can't do it alone.

19:35.942 --> 19:38.077
Well, you know, I could
quit my job at the restaurant

19:38.110 --> 19:39.078
and help out.

19:39.111 --> 19:40.613
That would be kind
of cool, you know?

19:40.647 --> 19:41.514
We'd go to work together.

19:41.548 --> 19:43.149
We'd go to lunch together.

19:43.182 --> 19:44.651
We'd come home together.

19:44.684 --> 19:45.585
Or we could stay married.

19:48.655 --> 19:50.523
So why don't you
hire Becky's boyfriend.

19:50.557 --> 19:51.591
That Mark.

19:51.624 --> 19:52.925
You're kidding.

19:52.959 --> 19:54.261
Well, he's good
with his hands.

19:54.294 --> 19:56.963
Just ask Becky.

19:56.996 --> 19:59.198
That's not funny.

19:59.232 --> 20:01.401
You cannot sit there and tell
me that Ziggy is irreplaceable,

20:01.434 --> 20:02.435
Dan.

20:02.469 --> 20:04.804
I mean, the guy wore
a rag on his head!

20:04.837 --> 20:07.407
His 20 grand
was irreplaceable.

20:07.440 --> 20:10.142
Yeah, well, the bank
was going to lend us 30.

20:10.176 --> 20:11.878
Maybe they will lend us 50.

20:11.911 --> 20:13.613
We've got nothing
else to put up.

20:13.646 --> 20:14.781
Oh, come on.

20:14.814 --> 20:17.650
We both know you
still want to do it.

20:17.684 --> 20:19.519
Yeah, I do.

20:19.552 --> 20:20.687
So what can it hurt, you know?

20:20.720 --> 20:22.955
We'll go down there
and, you know,

20:22.989 --> 20:23.890
we'll at least talk to Doug.

20:23.923 --> 20:24.724
We'll see what he says.

20:27.660 --> 20:29.996
OK, it's worth a shot.

20:30.029 --> 20:31.731
And you know what
the good part is?

20:31.764 --> 20:34.634
Without a partner for you
to split the profits with,

20:34.667 --> 20:37.637
everything you make is mine.

20:37.670 --> 20:39.972
[music playing]

20:43.910 --> 20:45.077
So what can it hurt, you know?

20:45.111 --> 20:47.213
We'll go down there
and, you know,

20:47.246 --> 20:48.180
we'll at least talk to Doug.

20:48.214 --> 20:49.015
We'll see what he says.

20:51.984 --> 20:54.253
OK, it's worth a shot.

20:54.287 --> 20:56.022
And you know the good part is?

20:56.055 --> 20:58.925
Without a partner for you
to split the profits with,

20:58.958 --> 21:00.259
everything you make is mine.

Mom!
Dad!

21:43.803 --> 21:44.971
Wait!
