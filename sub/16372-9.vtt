WEBVTT

00:56.400 --> 00:58.437
- Get it out of here. Now.
- Go, go, go.

01:09.600 --> 01:11.796
- Go, move!
- Move, move, move, go!

01:11.960 --> 01:14.395
- Get out of here.
- You, get out of the way!

01:14.560 --> 01:17.075
Get out of here, or I'll shoot you.

01:19.520 --> 01:21.239
Go, go!

01:22.320 --> 01:24.880
- Get out of here.
- Fire in the hole!

01:39.160 --> 01:43.951
When you were a little baby,
you lived in a warehouse.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.959
And we had bodyguards.

01:48.120 --> 01:50.430
Say, "Hi, Baz."

01:52.200 --> 01:58.037
And inside the warehouse
was a fake apartment.

01:58.760 --> 02:04.074
Oh, look, it's your daddy
in your fake living room.

02:04.240 --> 02:06.755
Hi, here's Daddy wondering
how much damage...

02:06.920 --> 02:08.798
...we've done to our sweet little girl.

02:08.960 --> 02:12.192
Well, it'll make
for an intriguing college essay.

02:12.400 --> 02:13.993
Yeah.

02:14.560 --> 02:17.758
So I know we're moving out,
but just a quick gut check here:

02:17.920 --> 02:19.070
Kirk is gone...

02:19.280 --> 02:22.557
...but according to Reddington, he's...
What, dead? Not dead?

02:22.720 --> 02:24.916
- He's definitely not in jail.
- I don't know.

02:25.120 --> 02:27.191
With Reddington,
I don't assume anything.

02:27.360 --> 02:29.511
He kept you from finding out
who your father is.

02:29.680 --> 02:32.070
You're the one that told me
that's in my past.

02:32.240 --> 02:34.391
I know, and it is, but...

02:34.800 --> 02:36.200
Maybe now that I'm a dad...

02:36.360 --> 02:40.673
...I'd be lying if I said
I didn't wonder who my father is.

02:41.440 --> 02:43.477
That's totally understandable.

02:44.600 --> 02:46.751
And another day,
I might feel differently...

02:46.920 --> 02:50.436
...but this is our present and our future.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.951
- That's all that matters.
- Yeah.

02:54.120 --> 02:56.555
- And getting her into a good college.
- Yeah.

02:57.680 --> 03:00.434
Let's start by finding her a place to live.

03:00.600 --> 03:05.436
She needs to be able to open up
her living room windows and see the sun.

03:08.720 --> 03:10.154
We all do.

03:11.440 --> 03:15.559
We spent months hunting
for Alexander Kirk at your insistence.

03:15.720 --> 03:18.076
He is responsible
for the deaths of FBI agents...

03:18.240 --> 03:20.471
- ...the abduction of Elizabeth and Agnes.
- You're upset.

03:20.640 --> 03:22.677
You're damn right I'm upset.
You let him go.

03:22.840 --> 03:25.514
Worse, it's clear to me now
that was your intent all along.

03:25.720 --> 03:27.154
- You played us.
- Harold...

03:27.320 --> 03:31.314
...my objective was to keep Elizabeth
and her child safe.

03:31.520 --> 03:33.671
I've done that. We've done that.

03:33.840 --> 03:39.359
Alexander Kirk is gone, and he won't
be back. It's time to move on.

03:39.760 --> 03:43.834
Last night, a seafood processing plant
in Maryland...

03:44.000 --> 03:46.959
...was attacked by armed commandoes.

03:47.160 --> 03:50.790
Local authorities
suspect rogue employees...

03:51.000 --> 03:56.200
...were secretly using the facility
to package and distribute narcotics.

03:56.360 --> 03:59.034
- But you know better.
- Now that you mention it, I do.

03:59.200 --> 04:02.398
Seven supposed employees
were killed in the attack.

04:02.560 --> 04:05.473
Photos were circulated
to law enforcement...

04:05.680 --> 04:07.797
...trying to connect them
to the drug trade.

04:08.600 --> 04:09.670
How did you get this?

04:09.840 --> 04:14.232
You're not looking at a seafood processing
plant employee, nor a drug dealer.

04:14.440 --> 04:16.829
That is Hassan Arkani.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.036
The terrorist, from Algeria.

04:19.519 --> 04:21.988
You're telling me
one of the most wanted terrorists...

04:22.160 --> 04:25.073
...was conducting a secret operation
out of a fish factory?

04:25.280 --> 04:27.590
You see?
No time to dwell on the past.

04:27.760 --> 04:30.798
If my people hear anything,
I'll contact Agent Keen.

04:30.960 --> 04:32.758
Agent Keen?

04:33.360 --> 04:35.829
Did you forget
her agent status was revoked?

04:36.040 --> 04:40.432
I did not forget that, or the plea agreement
I worked out with Laurel Hitchin...

04:40.600 --> 04:44.435
...that kept her out of jail
after she shot your attorney general.

04:44.600 --> 04:48.037
You don't want to dwell on the past,
then dwell on this:

04:48.200 --> 04:51.511
The loss of her badge was a stain
on Elizabeth's name and reputation...

04:51.680 --> 04:53.558
...which you are responsible for.

04:53.720 --> 04:56.076
Your presence in her life
turned it into what it is.

04:56.240 --> 04:58.596
You bring her nothing but pain,
grief and regret...

04:58.760 --> 05:03.357
...which you seem utterly oblivious to
and surprisingly powerless to rectify.

05:05.040 --> 05:07.191
Good talk, Harold.

05:11.600 --> 05:13.831
Hassan Arkani. Algerian born.

05:14.040 --> 05:17.351
He was a munitions expert
linked to the New Martyrs Brigade.

05:17.520 --> 05:21.230
The NMB is deadly enough to rank
number six on the Group Threat Index.

05:21.400 --> 05:24.950
Based in Libya, they have supporters
in countries throughout the region.

05:25.120 --> 05:27.680
I have documentation of attacks
in 17 countries.

05:27.840 --> 05:31.390
Yeah, but none on U.S. soil.
So, what's Arkani doing in Maryland?

05:31.600 --> 05:33.796
Whatever it was,
he's not doing it anymore.

05:33.960 --> 05:36.316
Is Reddington saying
they were building some kind...

05:36.520 --> 05:38.830
- ...of mass-casualty weapon to use?
- It's possible.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.471
We don't know what they were building,
or who took it or where it is now.

05:42.640 --> 05:45.030
I've notified Homeland, the CIA and NSA.

05:45.240 --> 05:46.913
Ressler, Navabi, get to that factory.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.470
Keen, let the locals know
we're taking over.

05:49.640 --> 05:51.393
Oh, wait. Where's Aram?

05:53.720 --> 05:54.915
Hey.

05:55.120 --> 05:56.395
Cooper told me.

05:56.560 --> 05:58.199
- You have nothing to worry about.
- Really?

05:58.360 --> 06:01.273
I'm being questioned in connection
to a Justice Department investigation...

06:01.440 --> 06:03.716
...into whether my girlfriend
committed espionage.

06:03.920 --> 06:07.038
- You didn't know.
- So I'm either a traitor or a moron.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.839
A moron. Definitely.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.275
You always know what to say.

06:10.440 --> 06:13.319
Aram, you're a trusting person
who assumes the best in people.

06:13.480 --> 06:16.393
Be yourself and they will see that.
Everyone does.

06:21.760 --> 06:24.400
<i>- A, what is your ETA, please?
- Agent Ressler?</i>

06:25.120 --> 06:27.112
This is Andrew Wyatt,
the factory manager.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.835
Thank you. Mr. Wyatt.
Thanks for your cooperation.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.878
Of course.
Whatever I can do to help.

06:32.040 --> 06:34.271
You've seen the images
of the people who died?

06:34.440 --> 06:36.636
Yeah. Like I told them,
two of the guys...

06:36.800 --> 06:40.157
...they've worked here for about a year.
The other guys I've never seen.

06:40.320 --> 06:43.597
And this man,
have you seen him before?

06:43.760 --> 06:44.989
No idea.

06:45.160 --> 06:48.278
Hey, if it wasn't drugs,
what do you think they were doing?

06:48.440 --> 06:50.511
We're gonna need the footage
from these cameras.

06:50.720 --> 06:53.076
I wish.
The cops had me check first thing.

06:53.240 --> 06:55.880
Looks like they turned off the system
right around 9:00.

06:56.040 --> 06:58.032
You need to see this.

06:58.200 --> 06:59.554
Excuse us. Thank you.

07:03.080 --> 07:04.673
- You got something?
- Nothing good.

07:04.840 --> 07:07.196
Whoever ran this place had it wiped down
before they ran.

07:07.400 --> 07:08.834
Between that and the fire,
there wasn't much left.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.960
We found shavings from some kind
of titanium alloy, and this.

07:13.160 --> 07:15.117
It's definitely a timing chip...

07:15.280 --> 07:17.272
...but I haven't seen one like this before.

07:17.440 --> 07:18.510
Timing chip. Used in...

07:18.680 --> 07:21.559
- Traffic lights, railway switches...
- Bombs.

07:37.240 --> 07:39.038
Arkani is dead.

07:40.360 --> 07:43.751
The Amtar Hamida Project
may be finished.

07:44.680 --> 07:47.149
The technology was stolen.

07:47.960 --> 07:50.919
Those responsible must be found
and exterminated.

07:51.480 --> 07:54.154
The work must be reacquired.

07:55.320 --> 07:57.232
Consider it done.

08:08.160 --> 08:09.560
What's up with Aram?

08:09.720 --> 08:11.871
- I don't know. He said it was urgent.
- This about the deposition?

08:12.040 --> 08:15.238
No. Actually, this is about
a different nightmare scenario.

08:15.920 --> 08:18.276
I've been running diagnostics
on the timer chip...

08:18.440 --> 08:21.399
...you recovered, and it is far
more impressive than anything...

08:21.600 --> 08:24.672
...we've seen from the NMB
or any extremist group, for that matter.

08:24.840 --> 08:28.880
In fact, it is as good as anything
the United States can make...

08:29.040 --> 08:32.272
- ...because we did make it.
- Good Lord.

08:32.440 --> 08:35.956
More specifically, the defense contractor
Blackthorn Kincaid made it.

08:36.159 --> 08:39.198
They make everything from
our own ICBMs to Israel's Iron Dome.

08:39.360 --> 08:40.635
So how'd Arkani get it?

08:40.799 --> 08:43.520
Our national security threat
just became a national security leak.

08:43.679 --> 08:46.514
Get to Blackthorn.
Tell them we expect full cooperation.

08:46.680 --> 08:50.151
Aram, let's move.
The deposition starts at 2.

08:51.280 --> 08:53.078
Panabaker will be at the deposition.

08:53.480 --> 08:56.040
I'm gonna push her
to get you reinstated as an agent.

08:56.200 --> 08:58.510
That would be amazing.

08:58.720 --> 09:00.791
But do you think
that's even possible?

09:00.960 --> 09:02.997
After all you've been through
and done...

09:03.640 --> 09:06.474
...I think it's crazy
they haven't done it already.

09:07.720 --> 09:10.554
I resent any implication
that we'd be less than forthcoming...

09:10.720 --> 09:15.078
Your classified technology was found in a
facility being run by a known terrorist.

09:15.280 --> 09:17.511
Someone in your position
might close ranks...

09:17.680 --> 09:18.716
That won't happen.

09:18.880 --> 09:22.590
Everyone here has dedicated his or
her life to protecting the American people.

09:22.760 --> 09:23.796
Tell us about the chip.

09:24.160 --> 09:26.231
It was manufactured
in the last four months...

09:26.400 --> 09:29.120
...as part of a surface-to-air
missile teleguidance system.

09:29.280 --> 09:31.670
Can you tell us who manufactured it,
which employees?

09:31.880 --> 09:34.839
A chip like that would travel across
several of our divisions.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.559
We're talking 60, maybe 80 people.

09:36.760 --> 09:38.831
- We're gonna need to see a list.
- Of course.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.232
But maybe we could suggest
a more targeted approach.

09:42.400 --> 09:44.232
James Maddox.

09:44.400 --> 09:46.995
At one time,
he was one of our best programmers.

09:47.160 --> 09:49.197
- Was?
- He had a drinking problem...

09:49.400 --> 09:53.633
...and anger issues. We tried to help,
but in the end we had to part ways.

09:53.800 --> 09:56.998
Given what we perceived
to be financial problems...

09:57.200 --> 09:59.760
- ...he might be of interest.
- He had access to the chip?

09:59.920 --> 10:01.718
Yes. I knew Jim.

10:01.880 --> 10:04.679
I find it hard to believe
that he would betray his country.

10:04.840 --> 10:06.877
Well, we'll get on that right away.

10:07.080 --> 10:09.754
In the meantime
we're gonna need to see that list.

10:09.960 --> 10:12.191
<i>Just made some calls. Yeah.</i>

10:14.440 --> 10:15.669
<i>I'll meet you at the pier.</i>

10:16.560 --> 10:19.120
Wendy, dear.
Your ears must be burning.

10:19.280 --> 10:20.919
<i>Dembe and I were talking about you.</i>

10:21.080 --> 10:23.675
Yeah? You figure out how
I'm gonna get my 13-year-old...

10:23.840 --> 10:26.355
...to soccer at the same time
as Liam's piano lesson?

10:26.560 --> 10:28.836
<i>- How are the boys?
- Another day in paradise.</i>

10:29.000 --> 10:32.880
<i>Leo took up the baritone, the Supernovas
won the regional championship...</i>

10:33.040 --> 10:36.317
...and Lionel started dating
some college freshman with a nipple ring.

10:36.480 --> 10:39.791
Almost enough to make a woman
hope Larry gets early parole.

10:40.320 --> 10:42.277
Not on your life, sugar. Let him rot.

10:42.440 --> 10:44.397
The boys are happy. I'm happy.

10:44.560 --> 10:46.392
To what do I owe the pleasure,
my love?

10:46.560 --> 10:50.600
I got word you're looking for the 411
on the New Martyrs Brigade.

10:50.760 --> 10:52.399
<i>- You got something?
- Little chatter.</i>

10:52.560 --> 10:55.792
You know I'm always tracking the buzz
on who's moving what and where.

10:55.960 --> 10:57.917
I hear the NMB's America bound.

10:58.080 --> 10:59.116
<i>How many?</i>

10:59.280 --> 11:02.671
<i>I'm hearing six.
Coming in scattershot.</i>

11:02.840 --> 11:04.593
<i>Their papers will be flawless.</i>

11:04.760 --> 11:06.592
<i>Who's running it, Al-Hambri?</i>

11:06.760 --> 11:09.150
You wish. They sent Farook.

11:09.320 --> 11:13.473
- Welcome back to the United States.
- You have a nice day now.

11:13.640 --> 11:15.996
Thank you, my love.
You're a human divining rod.

11:16.160 --> 11:18.550
<i>You always know where to look
and what to look for.</i>

11:18.720 --> 11:20.074
Oh, and for what it's worth...

11:20.280 --> 11:22.875
...I dropped an extra something
in the mail this month.

11:23.040 --> 11:25.157
Thought it might help
with orthodontist bills.

11:25.320 --> 11:29.075
You want to help,
come and fold some laundry. I gotta go.

11:29.240 --> 11:31.357
Lazy Bones just barfed in the kitchen.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.391
James Maddox, born August, 1970.

11:37.560 --> 11:40.917
I don't know, what do you think?
Look like the face of a traitor to you?

11:41.080 --> 11:42.912
Anybody's capable. You know that.

11:43.080 --> 11:47.359
Yeah, well, there's a special level in hell
for people who provide arms to terrorists.

11:48.080 --> 11:49.434
Heads up.

11:52.680 --> 11:53.796
James Maddox?

11:57.800 --> 11:59.154
Move!

12:02.360 --> 12:03.430
FBI.

12:03.840 --> 12:06.036
- FBI?
- Yeah.

12:06.240 --> 12:07.833
Yeah, I understand.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.434
Okay.

12:10.120 --> 12:11.873
That was Agent Keen.

12:12.080 --> 12:17.075
Mr. Reddington says NMB leadership
sent six operatives to reclaim that bomb...

12:17.920 --> 12:19.832
...or whatever they lost at that factory.

12:21.600 --> 12:23.239
It's time.

12:25.080 --> 12:27.276
Does Reddington have a name?

12:27.440 --> 12:30.638
Yeah. One. Farook Al-Thani.

12:31.320 --> 12:33.789
Agent Mojtabai,
walk us through this again.

12:33.960 --> 12:36.395
Tell us exactly
how you met Elise Nickerson.

12:36.560 --> 12:40.349
I was at the gym. She'd been waiting for
a friend and asked to borrow my phone.

12:40.520 --> 12:43.638
She said hers was lost,
and then one thing led to another...

12:43.800 --> 12:46.634
And next thing you knew
she was using your personal laptop...

12:46.800 --> 12:48.439
...to access classified data.

12:48.600 --> 12:49.829
When you put it like that...

12:50.000 --> 12:52.469
You expect us to believe
you knew nothing about this?

12:52.640 --> 12:56.600
Yes, because I didn't. I love this country.
I take my job very, very seriously.

12:56.760 --> 12:58.433
If I'm guilty of anything, it's...

12:59.080 --> 13:01.117
I have bad taste in women.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.555
A sort of blindness too.

13:02.760 --> 13:05.878
Shauna Boyd was a kleptomaniac.
Julia Hernandez was married.

13:06.040 --> 13:09.351
April Roderhorst had a little bit
of a secret porn addiction.

13:09.520 --> 13:12.513
- Funny story, actually...
- This is a deposition, not a memoir.

13:12.680 --> 13:16.515
Let's focus on how your computer
was used to breach national security.

13:17.080 --> 13:18.230
Yes, ma'am.

13:26.480 --> 13:30.190
Farook. We didn't know
our location was exposed.

13:30.360 --> 13:33.990
- I had no idea an attack was coming.
- Yes.

13:34.160 --> 13:37.278
- That's the problem.
- Look, I'm handling it. I'll find them.

13:38.600 --> 13:41.115
I have security camera footage
from the attack.

13:41.280 --> 13:46.560
I convinced the police there wasn't any.
Look, I know they sent you to warn me.

13:49.360 --> 13:50.953
Tell them warning received.

13:51.120 --> 13:53.794
They didn't send me to warn you.

13:54.520 --> 13:56.876
They sent me to replace you.

14:05.600 --> 14:06.829
It's Farook.

14:07.200 --> 14:08.793
<i>We need to talk.</i>

14:18.080 --> 14:19.230
He's here.

14:25.960 --> 14:27.917
I'm not here.

14:30.200 --> 14:31.953
This meeting never took place.

14:32.320 --> 14:35.631
And you will never be in the same room
with the president-elect.

14:38.040 --> 14:41.511
You really should try
Ginny's Cheeseburger Chowder.

14:41.680 --> 14:43.433
The ground chuck and spices...

14:43.600 --> 14:46.035
...the melted cheese.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.915
I highly recommend it
for the inaugural balls.

14:50.080 --> 14:52.675
If you think you can maintain
your immunity agreement...

14:52.840 --> 14:54.832
...by blackmailing the president-elect...

14:55.000 --> 14:57.913
...for allegedly taking
illegal campaign contributions...

14:58.120 --> 15:00.237
...from Alexander Kirk...

15:00.720 --> 15:02.552
...you're not as smart
as everyone says.

15:02.720 --> 15:05.394
Marlin, your boss made
a campaign promise to me...

15:05.560 --> 15:07.916
...and I intend to make sure he keeps it.

15:08.600 --> 15:11.274
Tell Robert I'll be in touch.

15:17.640 --> 15:19.518
How was the deposition?

15:19.680 --> 15:21.512
- Terrifying.
- I'm sure you were great.

15:21.680 --> 15:24.195
Yeah, in your eyes.

15:24.400 --> 15:27.791
In theirs, I look a lot like this guy.

15:27.960 --> 15:29.155
Yusuf Tillisi?

15:29.360 --> 15:32.194
Reddington said six NMB members
were dispatched to the U.S...

15:32.360 --> 15:34.113
...in the last 24 hours.

15:34.280 --> 15:36.431
He gave us one name
but not the other five.

15:37.200 --> 15:40.398
Do you have any idea how many people
fly into the country every day?

15:41.480 --> 15:43.756
So I had to customize an algorithm
to search for...

15:43.960 --> 15:47.510
Five needles in a huge haystack.
What makes you think Tillisi is one?

15:47.680 --> 15:50.912
He's the right age, works
for a Middle Eastern trade organization...

15:51.080 --> 15:53.675
...that I'm not sure actually exists.

15:53.840 --> 15:56.309
He lives in Lebanon,
but flew into Libya last month...

15:56.480 --> 15:58.472
...and I'm not seeing a return ticket out.

15:58.680 --> 16:01.195
Thing is, he flew into JFK
almost 72 hours ago...

16:01.360 --> 16:04.080
...so that doesn't fit
with Mr. Reddington's intel.

16:04.240 --> 16:07.119
He's probably legit,
but it's worth tracking him down...

16:07.320 --> 16:10.313
...verifying his reason for being
in the country. Let me do it.

16:10.480 --> 16:11.709
Based on places he flew...

16:11.880 --> 16:14.270
...I have channels
that might be more comprehensive.

16:16.120 --> 16:20.034
You're going to be cleared.
And when you are, we will celebrate.

16:28.880 --> 16:31.793
You want to tell me
what the hell happened?

16:31.960 --> 16:35.237
- Our facility was attacked.
- I know that. How?

16:35.400 --> 16:37.710
That's what I'm here to find out.

16:37.880 --> 16:40.111
Our people know the penalty
for disloyalty.

16:40.280 --> 16:42.840
So I thought perhaps I would ask you.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.072
Now you listen. I did my part.

16:46.240 --> 16:48.630
I provided the necessary technology.

16:48.800 --> 16:51.474
I'm not gonna lose everything
because you're too stupid...

16:51.640 --> 16:54.109
- ...to secure your own operation.
- Look around.

16:54.320 --> 16:56.357
You would be wise
to remember where you are.

16:56.520 --> 16:59.513
You made an agreement to see
our project to its completion...

16:59.680 --> 17:01.399
- That's not possible...
- Let me finish.

17:01.560 --> 17:03.677
If you expect to get paid...

17:04.319 --> 17:08.108
...you will help us find whoever did this
and recover our system.

17:08.280 --> 17:10.431
- You have surveillance?
- It won't do any good.

17:10.599 --> 17:12.876
The attackers were all wearing balaclavas.

17:13.040 --> 17:15.156
We have proprietary mapping software...

17:15.319 --> 17:18.915
...that can recognize
sufficient facial contours...

17:19.079 --> 17:21.117
...through a soft fabric mask.

17:21.280 --> 17:23.237
- Remarkable.
- Another trade secret.

17:23.400 --> 17:26.233
You tell your leadership
I'll be adding it to my bill.

17:26.440 --> 17:27.476
I have to get back.

17:27.640 --> 17:32.874
The FBI's investigating
how our chip ended up in Arkani's hands.

17:33.040 --> 17:35.794
I was forced
to make certain arrangements.

17:37.920 --> 17:41.152
I told you. I don't know anything
about a missing timer chip.

17:41.320 --> 17:42.549
Here's a tip, Mr. Maddox.

17:42.720 --> 17:45.872
Next time you want to appear innocent,
don't run from the FBI.

17:46.080 --> 17:49.118
It was stupid, okay?
I thought they were process servers.

17:49.280 --> 17:52.318
Sent by my wife.
We're in the middle of a nasty divorce.

17:52.480 --> 17:56.235
- I was trying to avoid going back to court.
- Been a tough few months for you.

17:56.400 --> 17:58.471
You lost your family, you lost your job.

17:58.680 --> 18:01.240
- Started drinking again.
- I wouldn't betray my country.

18:01.400 --> 18:04.916
We talked to Blackthorn.
You had access to that chip.

18:05.920 --> 18:09.072
My brother was a Marine.
He died in Kandahar.

18:09.240 --> 18:10.879
You think I'd put this on my arm...

18:11.040 --> 18:14.875
...and dishonor his sacrifice by giving
terrorists classified intelligence?

18:15.040 --> 18:18.477
I don't think you gave it to them.
I think you sold it to them.

18:19.640 --> 18:22.758
Look, tell me the truth now
and maybe I can still help you...

18:22.920 --> 18:23.956
Too late.

18:24.560 --> 18:28.270
Mr. Maddox, we just executed
a search warrant at your apartment...

18:28.440 --> 18:32.593
...and found a bank passbook in a vent,
traceable to an account in Madrid.

18:32.760 --> 18:34.353
- That's a lie.
- No.

18:34.520 --> 18:37.957
We also found a burner phone
taped underneath the kitchen table.

18:38.120 --> 18:40.874
One with a string
of international calls. To Libya.

18:41.040 --> 18:42.918
Okay, what the hell's going on?

18:43.080 --> 18:46.391
I'm being framed.
I swear, none of that is mine.

18:50.920 --> 18:53.037
What are you doing here?
I heard the FBI...

18:53.200 --> 18:55.032
That is under control.

18:55.200 --> 18:57.954
- I need your assistance.
- No. No, no. Forget it.

18:58.120 --> 19:01.192
It was a mistake letting you talk me
into configuring that chip.

19:01.360 --> 19:04.637
A $200,000 mistake.

19:04.800 --> 19:07.269
Look, like it or not,
we are in this together.

19:07.440 --> 19:09.557
If I go down, we both go down.

19:09.720 --> 19:10.995
What do you need me to do?

19:11.160 --> 19:14.676
This is the surveillance footage
from last night's attack.

19:14.880 --> 19:18.157
I want you to run the facial tomography
software on the attackers.

19:18.320 --> 19:21.279
- If they had masks, it'll take a minute.
- Can you just do it?

19:32.920 --> 19:34.718
Forget it, Keen. I know that look.

19:34.880 --> 19:36.633
Don't tell me you believe him.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.439
Something's off.

19:38.600 --> 19:41.911
It's just a read,
but his denial seems genuine.

19:42.080 --> 19:43.434
I might take that bet.

19:43.600 --> 19:46.593
Blackthorn called.
Another programmer came forward.

19:46.760 --> 19:49.150
Says he saw Maddox handling
the chip a month ago...

19:49.320 --> 19:52.677
- ...just before it dropped out of inventory.
- What about an eyewitness?

19:52.840 --> 19:55.514
- That change your mind?
- Take Navabi and get a statement.

19:55.680 --> 19:57.353
Where is Agent Navabi?

20:01.440 --> 20:02.999
I love that spot.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.593
Ezra.

20:19.560 --> 20:21.552
We've got a problem.

20:21.720 --> 20:25.430
One of my colleagues
at the Bureau flagged Ezra.

20:25.600 --> 20:26.954
- What's he know?
- Nothing yet.

20:27.160 --> 20:29.880
I volunteered to verify
he's here for a legitimate reason.

20:30.080 --> 20:32.151
Defending our homeland
from extremist savages?

20:32.320 --> 20:33.754
Doesn't get more legitimate than that.

20:33.960 --> 20:36.316
Mossad carried out a black op
on American soil.

20:36.480 --> 20:39.234
If the FBI finds out,
it'll be an international incident.

20:39.400 --> 20:40.834
- Where's the system?
- It's here.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.036
- Safe.
- For now.

20:42.400 --> 20:46.076
Reddington says the NMB sent Farook
with a team to get it back.

20:46.240 --> 20:48.755
Take the system and go.
You need to leave the country.

20:48.920 --> 20:50.559
What about you?

20:51.000 --> 20:54.232
I will do what I can to keep
the Bureau's attention elsewhere.

20:54.880 --> 20:57.475
Besides, I don't think
Alma would like me tagging along.

20:57.640 --> 20:59.518
Alma? Yesterday's news.

21:01.480 --> 21:04.552
You're right. Better get moving.

21:04.720 --> 21:05.756
Be safe.

21:12.080 --> 21:13.719
- You did it?
- Wasn't easy.

21:13.880 --> 21:19.194
Most of the footage was too remote,
but I did find an image close enough.

21:19.360 --> 21:21.829
Our program creates
a computed tomography map...

21:22.000 --> 21:24.834
...which I had to convert into a 3D image.

21:25.000 --> 21:29.677
Based on the data,
we got a 96 percent match.

21:31.120 --> 21:32.156
My God.

21:32.320 --> 21:34.391
- You know her?
- She's FBI.

21:35.640 --> 21:38.519
According to our profile, she's Mossad.

21:39.760 --> 21:40.955
<i>Mr. Deavers.</i>

21:41.920 --> 21:44.435
<i>- Tell me you found our system.
- Not yet.</i>

21:44.600 --> 21:48.037
But don't worry, Farook.
I know just where to look.

21:51.960 --> 21:55.271
You can't do this.
I wasn't driving recklessly...

21:55.440 --> 21:59.150
...and my navigation system
will prove that I wasn't speeding.

21:59.880 --> 22:01.599
What's your name, anyway?

22:01.760 --> 22:03.831
Hey! Are you listening to me?

22:04.000 --> 22:06.515
You're about to make a very big mistake.

22:06.720 --> 22:08.996
Pick up the phone and call my...

22:16.960 --> 22:18.440
Oh, boy.

22:18.880 --> 22:20.553
Isn't this a sticky wicket?

22:21.480 --> 22:23.472
You son of a bitch.

22:23.640 --> 22:27.395
As I mentioned, Senator Diaz made
a campaign promise...

22:27.560 --> 22:29.950
...that I intend to hold him to.

22:30.160 --> 22:33.073
You, what, bribe them?

22:33.240 --> 22:36.790
I've been known to make
the occasional charitable contribution.

22:37.000 --> 22:42.075
In exchange, my back is scratched
by the good men in blue.

22:42.240 --> 22:45.631
Yours, not so much.
You blew a point one-two.

22:45.840 --> 22:48.036
- I what?
- Blood Alcohol Content.

22:48.200 --> 22:52.160
Next time call a cab.

22:53.200 --> 22:54.680
Are you out of your mind?

22:54.840 --> 22:56.797
I've been sober for 12 years...

22:56.960 --> 23:01.591
Which is what makes your relapse
that much more tragic.

23:01.760 --> 23:06.516
The president can't have
a dipsomaniac serving as legal counsel.

23:06.680 --> 23:09.673
Happily, there is a way
to avoid the drunk tank.

23:11.720 --> 23:14.189
The inauguration is in two weeks.

23:14.360 --> 23:16.636
How do you expect me
to get you a private meeting?

23:16.800 --> 23:18.871
I have no idea.

23:19.080 --> 23:22.471
Let's hope you're smarter
than everyone says you are, Marlin.

23:22.640 --> 23:25.200
Marlin.
That's not a very common name.

23:25.360 --> 23:28.273
I knew a Marlin
when I was young. Marlin Trout.

23:28.440 --> 23:31.353
One boy, two fish names.

23:31.520 --> 23:33.079
Funny.

23:33.240 --> 23:35.755
Set the meeting, Marlin.

23:40.840 --> 23:42.274
I got your text, what's up?

23:42.480 --> 23:45.518
- Rolling out to take a witness statement.
- Someone at Blackthorn?

23:45.680 --> 23:47.353
A programmer claims
he saw Maddox with the chip.

23:47.520 --> 23:50.115
A month ago, but for some reason
didn't come forward...

23:50.320 --> 23:53.313
...until after the company served up
Maddox on a silver platter.

23:53.480 --> 23:57.076
- I'm telling you, something's off.
- There's only one way to find out.

23:57.240 --> 23:59.436
Will you give me a second?

24:02.200 --> 24:04.874
I spoke with Panabaker
about your reinstatement.

24:05.320 --> 24:07.277
She said there's nothing she can do.

24:08.480 --> 24:10.995
Nothing she can do now or ever?

24:12.280 --> 24:14.272
Sir, what'd she say?

24:14.440 --> 24:17.239
The attorney general would need to okay
your reinstatement.

24:17.400 --> 24:21.360
Since you pled guilty to killing
his predecessor, that's not gonna happen.

24:22.120 --> 24:23.713
I'm so sorry.

24:23.880 --> 24:26.076
Yeah. So am I.

24:26.240 --> 24:29.358
Hey. I ran down Yusuf Tillisi.

24:29.520 --> 24:31.477
The trade company he works for, it's real.

24:31.640 --> 24:33.677
The CEO put me
in touch with him directly.

24:33.840 --> 24:37.629
He's here for a few meetings,
then flies out at the end of the week.

24:37.800 --> 24:40.360
I'm sorry, but he checks out.

24:40.840 --> 24:43.799
Mr. Cooper got word from Main Justice.

24:44.000 --> 24:47.994
I am officially not a person of interest.

24:48.760 --> 24:50.672
That's great news.

24:50.880 --> 24:52.599
Right?

24:53.600 --> 24:56.752
I've never been so relieved
to be told I'm not interesting.

24:57.760 --> 25:03.358
I thought we could
maybe celebrate over dinner.

25:04.640 --> 25:07.235
It's a date. You pick.

25:07.440 --> 25:09.557
And make it somewhere amazing.

25:13.160 --> 25:14.992
Mr. Atwell? FBI.

25:15.200 --> 25:18.238
- Agent Ressler, this is Agent Navabi.
- That was fast.

25:18.400 --> 25:20.960
We understand you have information
about James Maddox...

25:21.160 --> 25:22.753
...and a theft at Blackthorn.

25:22.920 --> 25:24.149
Yes. Please, come in.

25:24.320 --> 25:26.391
I'd prefer
the neighbors didn't know about it.

25:28.240 --> 25:30.994
Is everything okay, Mr. Atwell?

25:45.600 --> 25:48.718
No, I did what you asked.
You said all I had to do was get them...

25:58.360 --> 26:00.192
Go. Leave him.

26:08.120 --> 26:10.316
<i>- Agent Ressler.
- We were set up.</i>

26:10.480 --> 26:13.393
<i>There was no witness.
It was an ambush.</i>

26:13.560 --> 26:15.631
They were in the house.
The NMB took Samar.

26:15.840 --> 26:18.480
<i>- The NMB?
- They wanted to kill me and abduct her.</i>

26:18.680 --> 26:22.037
That makes no sense.
Why would the NMB single out Navabi?

26:22.200 --> 26:24.635
They're in a black SUV.
No plate, shattered rear window.

26:24.800 --> 26:26.712
Sending an alert
to law enforcement now.

26:26.880 --> 26:30.078
- Rolling backup to your location.
- Reddington, we need your help.

26:30.240 --> 26:32.152
<i>Samar's been abducted.
The NMB took her.</i>

26:32.360 --> 26:34.750
<i>- Slow down.
- I'm putting you on speaker.</i>

26:34.920 --> 26:36.274
We're sending you everything.

26:36.440 --> 26:39.831
All the search results for possible
NMB members coming into the country...

26:40.000 --> 26:43.072
...all the profiles we ruled out.
Maybe we missed something.

26:43.240 --> 26:45.311
Have you identified anyone
other than Farook?

26:45.480 --> 26:48.473
No. My program's vetted
tens of thousands of candidates...

26:48.640 --> 26:51.394
...but only one real suspect so far
and Navabi cleared him.

26:51.560 --> 26:53.074
<i>- Who?
- His name is Yusuf Tillisi.</i>

26:53.240 --> 26:54.674
<i>His photo is in the file.</i>

26:54.880 --> 26:56.917
Samar spoke to him,
said it was nothing.

26:57.080 --> 27:00.710
Yusuf Tillisi isn't a terrorist.
He also isn't Yusuf Tillisi.

27:00.880 --> 27:03.873
His real name is Ezra Mandell,
an operative for the Mossad.

27:04.040 --> 27:06.839
- Samar's worked with him.
- Why would she lie about that?

27:07.000 --> 27:10.835
To protect her countryman, to prevent you
from linking the Mossad...

27:11.000 --> 27:13.356
...to the attack on Arkani's operation.

27:13.520 --> 27:15.637
A Mossad strike team
was operating here?

27:15.800 --> 27:18.679
<i>- Without permission?
- At least we know why the NMB took her.</i>

27:19.080 --> 27:22.915
<i>The question is where
and how long they'll keep her alive.</i>

27:30.560 --> 27:32.916
Tell me where the system is.

27:33.640 --> 27:36.360
Save yourself
an immense amount of pain.

27:38.160 --> 27:39.514
I'm good.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.435
I can't remember a time...

27:54.000 --> 27:55.832
...when I wasn't fighting Israel.

27:57.640 --> 28:00.155
As a boy in Gaza...

28:00.600 --> 28:04.071
...I threw rocks at soldiers.

28:06.440 --> 28:09.160
As I grew, so did the weapons.

28:09.320 --> 28:14.156
The rocks became guns,
the guns became rockets.

28:16.040 --> 28:19.431
For me, life is war.

28:20.120 --> 28:23.318
And that war changed
with the creation of the Iron Dome.

28:23.480 --> 28:26.075
The most advanced
missile-defense system in history.

28:26.240 --> 28:31.190
Over 1200 of our rockets
were intercepted.

28:31.360 --> 28:33.556
The NMB realized...

28:33.720 --> 28:37.350
...that the best way
to defeat a superior technology...

28:37.520 --> 28:41.560
...is to turn an engineer
who designed it.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.040
James Maddox.

28:43.240 --> 28:45.596
Mr. Maddox was just convenient.

28:46.160 --> 28:50.393
The NMB's money bought them
someone much higher up the food chain.

28:50.560 --> 28:54.759
I promised a teleguidance system
capable of getting past the Iron Dome.

28:54.960 --> 28:59.273
And after six months of work,
I do not intend to start over.

29:00.560 --> 29:03.712
Where is it?

29:04.520 --> 29:08.878
Don't make me ask again.

29:10.640 --> 29:14.759
We're all set. There's a Hawker 900
on the tarmac at BWI.

29:14.920 --> 29:17.560
Take the system.
Use one of those SKB cases.

29:17.960 --> 29:19.474
Put this in the car.

29:19.640 --> 29:21.472
FBI! Hands in the air now!

29:24.920 --> 29:28.880
- Levi Shur. You don't call, you don't write.
- How'd you find us?

29:29.040 --> 29:31.350
Mossad opened this safe house
with FBI assistance.

29:31.520 --> 29:34.319
I know because our agencies share intel.

29:34.480 --> 29:35.834
At least I thought they did.

29:36.040 --> 29:37.599
The NMB has Samar.

29:37.760 --> 29:39.956
We know you hit Arkani's factory
and so do they.

29:40.120 --> 29:41.349
- How?
- I don't know.

29:41.520 --> 29:44.592
But she was taken by Farook Al-Thani
almost an hour ago.

29:44.800 --> 29:46.314
She lied to us.

29:46.480 --> 29:49.518
Tried to protect you when she found out
Mossad was behind this.

29:49.720 --> 29:51.359
You don't know
what you're talking about.

29:51.560 --> 29:53.233
- No?
- No.

29:53.400 --> 29:55.756
Samar didn't find out about the raid.

29:55.920 --> 29:58.276
Samar planned the raid.

30:04.320 --> 30:06.755
Enough. We need to escalate this.

30:06.920 --> 30:08.479
What the hell is so funny?

30:08.640 --> 30:10.871
She won't talk.

30:11.880 --> 30:15.032
We're both the same.
Both true believers.

30:15.200 --> 30:16.953
Willing to die for what we love.

30:17.120 --> 30:19.032
Farook. We may have something.

30:19.200 --> 30:21.920
There's an entry for someone
only under the letter L.

30:22.360 --> 30:25.000
The number's on a list we have
for possible Mossad operatives.

30:25.160 --> 30:26.389
- Call it.
- Now, hang on.

30:26.560 --> 30:29.029
If it's the Mossad,
they might trace the call back.

30:29.200 --> 30:30.919
There's no reason to contact them.

30:31.600 --> 30:35.833
Unless they're willing
to trade their agent for our system.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.071
That wasn't the plan.
She's seen my face.

30:38.240 --> 30:40.880
She can't be traded
for anything, understand?

30:41.040 --> 30:43.953
- She's never leaving this room.
- You are not my concern.

30:44.120 --> 30:45.713
We had a deal.

30:45.880 --> 30:47.439
I'm not signing off on this.

30:47.600 --> 30:51.753
Then it seems you are the one
never leaving this room.

30:56.280 --> 30:58.192
What about the CIA? Homeland?

30:58.360 --> 31:01.000
You don't have intel
on where they might have taken her?

31:01.160 --> 31:02.913
You know Arkani's building a bomb...

31:03.080 --> 31:05.515
...but don't know
if they have a safehouse nearby?

31:05.680 --> 31:06.955
No.

31:07.120 --> 31:08.156
And it's not a bomb.

31:08.320 --> 31:11.836
It's a missile guidance system
designed to defeat the Iron Dome.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.674
In the wrong hands,
it could jeopardize thousands of lives.

31:14.840 --> 31:17.071
I'll feel better
when it's in my hands. Get it.

31:19.520 --> 31:20.590
Fine.

31:23.400 --> 31:27.030
Take it.
All I care about is finding Samar.

31:27.760 --> 31:30.116
Levi. Here, sir.

31:33.520 --> 31:34.556
Samar.

31:34.720 --> 31:37.076
<i>I'm afraid Agent Navabi
can't come to the phone.</i>

31:37.240 --> 31:41.632
I'm speaking with one
of her Mossad associates, yes?

31:41.800 --> 31:43.029
Is this Farook Al-Thani?

31:43.200 --> 31:44.395
Names are unimportant now.

31:44.560 --> 31:47.394
What matters is that we both have
what the other wants.

31:47.560 --> 31:49.313
<i>So I propose a trade.</i>

31:49.480 --> 31:52.279
<i>If you want
to see your colleague alive again...</i>

31:52.440 --> 31:54.909
...bring our system,
Cornerstone Park...

31:55.080 --> 31:57.800
...east entrance, in the next 30 minutes.

31:57.960 --> 32:02.034
<i>And take care to bring it all,
or for every piece missing...</i>

32:03.520 --> 32:06.399
...I will extract a piece of Agent Navabi.

32:06.560 --> 32:08.119
Let me speak to her.

32:09.760 --> 32:12.639
- Can we trace the call?
- I'm sure they're already on the move.

32:12.800 --> 32:14.837
We gotta do something.
We gotta get her back.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.912
She's an operative, Levi.
She knew the risks.

32:17.120 --> 32:19.874
- I'm not letting her die.
- You said it yourself.

32:20.080 --> 32:23.198
The wrong step could jeopardize
the lives of thousands of civilians.

32:23.360 --> 32:25.397
Hey, neither of you
is gonna do anything.

32:25.560 --> 32:28.837
This is an FBI matter now. Are we clear?

32:29.000 --> 32:31.435
I'm still going to that park.

32:33.560 --> 32:36.394
Get him back here. Now.

32:36.600 --> 32:39.559
<i>Ressler. No word on Agent Navabi.
You have the system?</i>

32:39.720 --> 32:40.915
We have it, but look...

32:41.400 --> 32:42.834
Levi!

32:43.320 --> 32:44.800
Move.

32:51.080 --> 32:54.835
Okay, satellite images of
Cornerstone Park are coming online now.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.798
Al-Thani said the east entrance.

32:56.960 --> 32:58.872
TAC units are taking positions around it.

32:59.080 --> 33:02.915
Careful. If Al-Thani sees anything
that screams FBI, Navabi's dead.

33:03.120 --> 33:04.156
I'm here.

33:04.320 --> 33:07.199
<i>Take the jogging path
until you reach a pushcart vendor.</i>

33:07.360 --> 33:10.592
Before you get anything,
I need proof of life. Do you hear me?

33:12.560 --> 33:15.200
<i>Levi, destroy it.
You can't give it to them.</i>

33:15.360 --> 33:17.158
<i>You have your proof.</i>

33:22.920 --> 33:24.957
I've got him. Do I stop him?

33:25.480 --> 33:27.711
It's our careers if this goes wrong, but...

33:29.640 --> 33:31.677
No. Let him make the drop.
Just make damn sure...

33:31.840 --> 33:33.832
...that system doesn't get out of the park.

33:39.440 --> 33:42.114
This goes nowhere
until Samar is brought here.

33:48.880 --> 33:50.200
It's been authenticated.

33:50.360 --> 33:51.999
Where is she?

33:58.360 --> 33:59.794
That's her. That's her!

33:59.960 --> 34:03.237
- South Drive.
- All units move in. Stop that van.

34:03.400 --> 34:05.676
Ressler, move your team in now.

34:10.040 --> 34:12.190
Hands! Hands where I can see them.

34:17.239 --> 34:18.356
Bring it down!

34:20.440 --> 34:22.079
I'm not the one controlling it.

34:24.040 --> 34:25.440
Cover him.

34:39.679 --> 34:41.399
Aram, I lost visual. What do you got?

34:41.600 --> 34:42.920
Nothing. It just disappeared.

34:43.080 --> 34:45.389
Whoever was controlling it
had line of sight to it.

34:45.600 --> 34:48.320
Somebody saw it. We're monitoring
for reports or complaints.

34:48.520 --> 34:50.112
Oh, I got one. I got one.

34:50.280 --> 34:54.797
Reports of someone flying a drone
from the roof of the Mazelon Hostel.

34:54.960 --> 34:57.475
<i>- All right, the address...
- Got it. Call their security.</i>

35:05.680 --> 35:08.593
Aram, the guy we have the picture of,
Farook?

35:09.160 --> 35:12.153
I might have him
leaving the hostel on 92nd.

35:12.520 --> 35:15.513
On the ground. On the ground! Move.

35:19.720 --> 35:21.154
Move, move!

35:22.400 --> 35:23.675
Look out!

35:23.840 --> 35:25.832
Hey! Drop the bag!

36:03.120 --> 36:05.237
We're ready for you this time,
Jonathan.

36:05.400 --> 36:06.880
Been working on my paso doble.

36:07.840 --> 36:09.035
Fred Astaire, look out.

36:09.200 --> 36:11.237
Bobby's lost 6 pounds.

36:11.400 --> 36:13.756
Two million people may watch
the inauguration...

36:13.920 --> 36:16.151
...but the dance floor
is all Miriam cares about.

36:16.360 --> 36:18.033
My girl and I are gonna tear it up.

36:18.200 --> 36:20.032
Sir. Sir.

36:22.080 --> 36:26.154
- What's wrong with him?
- Sir, there's a situation.

36:26.320 --> 36:28.880
I'm so sorry.
I would have said something earlier, but...

36:29.080 --> 36:30.196
There you are.

36:30.600 --> 36:33.832
- Dance lessons, what fun!
- What the hell's he doing here?

36:34.040 --> 36:35.030
Oh, my God, you're...

36:35.200 --> 36:38.511
Just hoping the jackals and mongers
will give you the time and space...

36:38.680 --> 36:43.038
...you need to settle in before
they start feasting at your doorstep.

36:43.480 --> 36:45.039
What the hell are you doing here?

36:45.200 --> 36:46.953
I know your dance card is full...

36:47.120 --> 36:50.079
...but we have an appointment
that I must insist you keep.

36:50.240 --> 36:54.757
The mustache is an interesting choice,
sort of a Grover Cleveland look.

36:54.920 --> 36:56.673
- Marlin, call security.
- No.

36:56.840 --> 36:58.433
Just...

36:59.200 --> 37:00.998
...give us a moment.

37:04.400 --> 37:05.993
You and I are even.

37:06.200 --> 37:08.351
- Not quite.
- The hell we're not.

37:08.520 --> 37:11.479
I halted my presidential campaign
and launched a Senate hearing...

37:11.640 --> 37:13.677
...into Alexander Kirk's
links to terrorism.

37:13.840 --> 37:16.958
And in exchange
you received a generous donation...

37:17.120 --> 37:18.839
...and a bump in the polls.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.071
Now look what's happened.

37:21.240 --> 37:25.280
Robert, the man you're replacing
as the leader of the free world...

37:25.440 --> 37:28.399
...has a legacy
he'll want you to help burnish...

37:28.600 --> 37:31.752
...by keeping certain people
and policies in place.

37:31.920 --> 37:33.115
He'll want favors.

37:33.280 --> 37:36.512
To get them, this is one of the things
he'll have to do for you.

37:37.240 --> 37:39.914
This is over. You and I are done.

37:40.080 --> 37:42.197
Then perhaps I should speak to Miriam.

37:42.400 --> 37:45.598
I'm sure she's dying to know
what kind of business...

37:45.760 --> 37:47.399
...you and I have been conducting.

37:47.560 --> 37:49.153
It's up to you, Robert.

37:49.320 --> 37:52.074
Would you prefer to be
in the White House or the doghouse?

37:52.240 --> 37:54.118
Robert?

38:02.240 --> 38:05.392
You put our country at risk
to get me back.

38:05.760 --> 38:08.036
I don't know whether to hit you
or hug you.

38:10.080 --> 38:12.914
Well, you know what Ezra
said about Alma?

38:13.640 --> 38:15.472
I broke off our engagement.

38:15.640 --> 38:17.313
I'm sorry.

38:18.440 --> 38:19.954
Don't be sorry.

38:20.560 --> 38:22.153
Be happy.

38:28.200 --> 38:31.238
You obstructed our investigation,
put lives at risk.

38:31.400 --> 38:33.756
- Lied to us.
- Yes, to protect my country.

38:33.920 --> 38:34.990
Your country?

38:35.160 --> 38:38.073
While you're on this task force,
you're protecting the U.S.

38:38.240 --> 38:41.039
- And today I protected both.
- Almost died in the process.

38:44.440 --> 38:46.193
You need to think
about where your allegiance lies.

38:46.360 --> 38:47.919
- No, I don't.
- Fine.

38:48.480 --> 38:51.040
You're clear about that.
Let me be clear about this.

38:51.200 --> 38:52.759
You can't lie to me.

38:52.920 --> 38:55.560
You can't operate
without my authority, ever.

38:55.720 --> 38:57.791
I feel I've earned
your trust and respect.

38:58.440 --> 39:02.514
Now go home, get some rest, and think
about whether you agree with that.

39:02.680 --> 39:05.070
If you do, I'll see you in the morning.

39:05.680 --> 39:07.592
If not, I won't.

39:15.120 --> 39:18.272
He's right, you should get some rest.

39:18.440 --> 39:20.193
- Dinner can wait.
- You sure?

39:20.760 --> 39:24.151
- Totally.
- Thank you for the rain check.

39:24.600 --> 39:26.353
Actually...

39:27.240 --> 39:28.879
...I don't want a rain check.

39:29.040 --> 39:30.394
I mean...

39:31.000 --> 39:32.878
...I do.

39:33.200 --> 39:36.238
Obviously I do, but...

39:36.400 --> 39:40.280
I don't. You know how I told you
that deposition was terrifying?

39:40.480 --> 39:42.073
It was worse than terrifying.

39:42.240 --> 39:44.072
It was...

39:44.240 --> 39:46.357
...embarrassing.

39:46.760 --> 39:48.797
There I was, on the record...

39:48.960 --> 39:53.034
...testifying to what horrible taste
I have in women, my habit of...

39:53.560 --> 39:57.076
...falling for people
who aren't what they appear to be.

39:57.240 --> 39:59.311
What I make them out to be.

39:59.480 --> 40:02.791
What happened with Elise
was kind of soul crushing.

40:04.240 --> 40:06.471
To find out that...

40:06.640 --> 40:08.677
...the person that you love...

40:11.480 --> 40:13.233
...the person you can see
yourself marrying...

40:14.120 --> 40:18.160
...and having a family with,
and growing old with...

40:18.600 --> 40:22.355
- ...to find out that person...
- Is a spy.

40:22.840 --> 40:25.560
Someone whose allegiances
you can't trust.

40:26.080 --> 40:28.436
I can't be with a person like that.

40:39.040 --> 40:41.350
I thought Panabaker said
you'd never be reinstated.

40:41.520 --> 40:43.193
She did. Why?

40:43.360 --> 40:48.480
<i>- -Precedent for commuting sentences
in the final hours of an administration.</i>

40:48.640 --> 40:51.633
<i>But the full presidential pardon
of Elizabeth Keen...</i>

40:51.840 --> 40:54.514
<i>...for the murder
of Attorney General Tom Connolly...</i>

40:54.720 --> 40:56.871
<i>...is the most surprising
in recent memory.</i>

40:57.040 --> 40:59.396
- Did she just say...?
- You've been pardoned.

40:59.600 --> 41:02.638
Oh, my God, Liz.
You've been pardoned.

41:07.880 --> 41:11.874
<i>- -Continue to speculate on what
was behind the controversial decision...</i>

41:12.040 --> 41:13.394
<i>...to pardon Elizabeth Keen.</i>

41:13.560 --> 41:18.032
<i>The White House issued a statement
that the president will not be commenting.</i>

41:29.840 --> 41:31.240
Hey.

41:31.640 --> 41:33.154
Hey.

41:34.240 --> 41:36.994
Look, I was thinking
about what you told me.

41:37.480 --> 41:38.596
Like I said...

41:39.280 --> 41:40.999
...I hope you're happy about it.

41:41.160 --> 41:43.072
There's someone else.

41:44.160 --> 41:48.154
I've been waiting a long time
for this, for us, for you...

41:48.320 --> 41:49.913
...but...

41:51.480 --> 41:54.075
...I am in love with someone else.

41:56.200 --> 41:57.998
It was Reddington.

41:58.200 --> 42:01.113
He got the president of the United States
to pardon me.

42:01.280 --> 42:03.192
How does he do that?

42:03.360 --> 42:05.033
I don't know...

42:05.440 --> 42:08.239
...and right now I don't care.

42:09.720 --> 42:12.394
I'm just glad I can finally say...

42:12.920 --> 42:17.472
...it's good to have you back,
Agent Keen.
