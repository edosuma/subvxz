WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:00.200
.

00:06.920 --> 00:08.080
We're back!

00:10.120 --> 00:11.520
Let's fucking do this!

00:14.160 --> 00:15.320
Come on!

00:16.520 --> 00:17.600
More pulling.

00:18.960 --> 00:20.600
More getting mortal!

00:21.240 --> 00:22.280
More fights...

00:26.720 --> 00:28.480
Things are about to go crazy.

00:30.160 --> 00:32.120
Let the chaos begin.

00:32.200 --> 00:34.400
Me and Kyle have been shagging
a lot.

00:34.480 --> 00:38.360
We're not girlfriend and boyfriend
but we have been seeing each other.

00:39.880 --> 00:43.280
Being here isn't the right thing
for us any more.

00:43.360 --> 00:45.000
I've got thinking to do.

00:48.480 --> 00:51.600
I've got to tell Charlotte about
their ridiculous pact.

00:51.680 --> 00:55.600
You can't tempt him but I can.
This is Operation Slit a Clit.

00:55.680 --> 00:57.440
Kiss me, Gary!

00:57.520 --> 01:01.200
Charlotte thinks I'm gonna get with
her. She could not be more wrong.

01:01.280 --> 01:05.440
This is going better than I ever
would've thought. What's going on?

01:07.240 --> 01:10.240
How could I have been so fucking
stupid to fall for this?

01:11.560 --> 01:16.040
Idiot! I just actually
really wanna kiss him.

01:16.120 --> 01:19.560
I can't go there again. I don't want
either of us getting hurt.

01:21.280 --> 01:23.520
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

01:23.600 --> 01:25.760
I'd never kiss anyone
without a six pack.

01:25.840 --> 01:27.920
The hardest graft I've done
is my hair.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.360
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

01:30.440 --> 01:32.680
I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.720
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

01:34.800 --> 01:36.480
I'm preened to perfection.

01:36.560 --> 01:38.800
I'm colourful and full of mischief.

01:38.880 --> 01:40.640
I'm fake, flirty and I've got FFs.

01:40.720 --> 01:43.520
I'm gonna make sparks fly
and get everyone feisty.

01:43.600 --> 01:45.520
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

01:59.000 --> 02:00.720
Me and the lads have just woke up.

02:00.800 --> 02:04.560
We're still proper creasing about
what we did to Charlotte last night.

02:04.640 --> 02:05.920
Tomato sauce, eggs.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.600
Mate, that room is gonna
fucking stink today.

02:08.680 --> 02:12.520
I am absolutely buzzing
at how well last night went.

02:12.600 --> 02:15.600
But more importantly,
how well Charlotte took it.

02:15.680 --> 02:19.640
That's why we're best friends.
I can have a laugh with her.

02:22.080 --> 02:24.480
What the hell happened
with you last night?

02:24.560 --> 02:27.920
I got flour-bombed,
egged, tomato-sauced.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.040
Charlotte thought
she was gonna close the deal.

02:31.120 --> 02:33.960
But no, Gary ended up pelting her
with cake mixture.

02:34.040 --> 02:36.560
It looked like Casper
had spunked all over her.

02:36.640 --> 02:40.560
I'm not gonna lie, right,
and there was a split second

02:40.640 --> 02:44.120
when he put us in the hot tub
to help wash us off.

02:44.200 --> 02:48.400
We were smiling and I forgot about
the game for a second.Oh, shit!

02:48.480 --> 02:51.800
I feel like at one point nearer
the end of Operation Slit Clit

02:51.880 --> 02:56.120
there was a time when I did actually
genuinely want to kiss Gary.

02:56.200 --> 02:57.800
But I was still getting pied.

02:57.880 --> 03:01.200
Me and Kyle we're in a really,
really good place at the minute

03:01.280 --> 03:03.880
and I just hope it continues
for a while.

03:03.960 --> 03:07.800
Last night was amazing. Things
between us have never been better.

03:07.880 --> 03:10.600
When we're good
I feel literally the luckiest girl.

03:10.680 --> 03:15.600
Holly is slap bang into Kyle. I hope
this all goes well for them both.

03:21.800 --> 03:25.760
I've only been back in the house for
a few days but it feels so different.

03:25.840 --> 03:28.360
I've been trying to figure out
what's changed.

03:28.440 --> 03:30.440
But I'm starting to realise it's me.

03:32.880 --> 03:36.400
The other times that I came in,
I just got smashed and enjoyed it.

03:36.480 --> 03:38.520
This time I'm just like...

03:38.600 --> 03:42.280
James has grown up. His life outside
this house is totally different.

03:42.360 --> 03:45.880
I don't wanna hear him talking about
how he doesn't fit in.

03:45.960 --> 03:47.560
It's starting to get a bit old.

03:47.640 --> 03:52.000
Don't start all this cos then I
think something bad's gonna happen.

03:52.080 --> 03:55.920
James is starting to talk about
the same shit that people talk about

03:56.000 --> 03:58.160
when they're planning on leaving.

03:58.240 --> 04:00.640
This is last thing
I wanna hear from James.

04:00.720 --> 04:03.320
I don't wanna be feeling like this
all the time.

04:03.400 --> 04:05.280
You won't. It's gonna get better.

04:10.800 --> 04:12.280
(phone rings)

04:12.360 --> 04:14.000
I'm not going to work!

04:14.080 --> 04:15.560
I know who it's gonna be.

04:15.640 --> 04:19.600
If she's even thinking about
sending us to work, she can swivel.

04:19.680 --> 04:21.720
What's the work for today?

04:22.800 --> 04:23.800
What's the treat?

04:25.680 --> 04:28.040
Can we? House party, like?

04:29.800 --> 04:31.760
Ah, that's mint. Cheers, Anna.

04:33.280 --> 04:34.280
Buzzin'.

04:36.160 --> 04:38.160
Yeah, listen to this, right.

04:45.200 --> 04:48.760
Anna must've got laid,
had the biggest orgasm ever,

04:48.840 --> 04:52.120
and won the lottery.
She's given us a house party!

04:54.960 --> 04:59.080
What about casino and you have black
jack tables and little bow ties?

04:59.160 --> 05:01.720
Every one of our house parties
needs a theme.

05:01.800 --> 05:04.720
What about what we wanted to be
when we were younger?

05:04.800 --> 05:06.320
Like when you grow up?
Yeah.

05:06.400 --> 05:08.400
That's good.
That's really good.

05:08.480 --> 05:10.800
The theme of this party
is going to be

05:10.880 --> 05:13.720
what you wanted to be
when you were younger.

05:13.800 --> 05:17.240
I wanted to be a kick boxer.
I wanted to be a pop star.

05:17.320 --> 05:20.320
I'm already what I wanted to be,
a fucking fanny magnet.

05:20.400 --> 05:24.520
I wanted to be a ballerina or
a burlesque dancer or a Spice Girl.

05:24.600 --> 05:28.920
Shock, not one of them made it. Not
one of them achieved their goals.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.360
Bunch of failures.

05:39.360 --> 05:40.760
(Charlotte)Gary!

05:41.600 --> 05:42.760
Come here, please.

05:42.840 --> 05:45.320
Charlotte calls me in her room.
When I walk in

05:45.400 --> 05:48.840
and see that look on her face,
I know she's up to something.

05:48.920 --> 05:50.920
I thought of this really good game

05:51.000 --> 05:56.680
and it's called
Pin the Parsnip on Gary. (laughs)

05:56.760 --> 05:59.600
So I've come up with the game
Pin the Parsnip on Gary.

05:59.680 --> 06:04.960
And every artist needs their muse.
So come on, Gaz, get your dick out.

06:05.040 --> 06:06.760
Drop your pants...

06:09.800 --> 06:12.280
No, it's not! It's for the game.

06:12.360 --> 06:15.040
You haven't gotta invent a game.
Just ask.

06:15.120 --> 06:17.960
Drop it, then! Like, lift the top.

06:21.520 --> 06:24.720
Gary, I can't see anything.
What are you embarrassed for?

06:24.800 --> 06:25.800
Just hold it up.

06:27.920 --> 06:31.920
So I'm staring at the parsnip
and it's bringing back memories.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.600
I still can't believe
how big it is on a floppy.

06:34.680 --> 06:38.320
I'm not finished.
This action takes time.

06:38.400 --> 06:40.520
Fucking bet it does.

06:40.600 --> 06:45.080
With every stroke of me pencil
I feel a flutter in me fanny.

06:45.160 --> 06:47.720
I do miss the parsnip,
just a little bit.

06:47.800 --> 06:50.120
What do ya think?

06:50.200 --> 06:52.720
I think that is a good one.
It is a good drawing.

06:57.160 --> 07:01.720
(James) We're getting the house
sorted. It's looking fucking epic.

07:01.800 --> 07:05.240
But before the party starts
I've got something to tell everyone.

07:05.320 --> 07:07.440
I know for a fact
this is gonna be so hard.

07:07.520 --> 07:09.920
Will youse all come down
and sit down here?

07:10.800 --> 07:13.640
James is calling everyone
downstairs.

07:13.720 --> 07:15.920
I wanna know what's up with the kid.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.400
Is that everyone?
(sighs) Fucking hell.

07:20.400 --> 07:24.800
I've never, ever been so nervous
to say anything in me life.

07:24.880 --> 07:30.320
(exhales) Right, well,
I don't want this to spoil tonight

07:30.400 --> 07:35.320
cos I wanna have a fucking mint time
with everyone but, you know...

07:37.480 --> 07:39.680
I've got a horrible feeling
about this.

07:39.760 --> 07:42.400
I can see he can't even
get his words out

07:42.480 --> 07:45.160
and I know what
we've been talking about.

07:47.400 --> 07:50.520
I just hope he's not gonna say
what I think he's gonna say.

07:50.600 --> 07:54.120
I'm not that young daft lad I was
when I moved in here

07:54.200 --> 07:58.400
and I feel like my life
has moved so much

07:58.480 --> 08:00.720
since I started all this.

08:04.600 --> 08:06.160
I've made a decision that...

08:08.280 --> 08:11.120
...I need to move on
to the next step.

08:11.200 --> 08:14.200
And for me to do that
it's to leave here.

08:18.800 --> 08:21.440
These people,
I've spent so much time with them.

08:21.520 --> 08:26.360
I've lived with them and to tell them
that I can't do this any more

08:26.440 --> 08:30.360
is the hardest thing
I've ever done in my life.

08:34.120 --> 08:36.160
I'm absolutely gobsmacked.

08:36.240 --> 08:39.920
Like, even though James isn't
the biggest character in the house

08:40.000 --> 08:42.760
we've still been together
since day one.

08:46.520 --> 08:50.160
I understand why James doesn't want
to be in this house any more.

08:50.240 --> 08:52.520
He's grown up and he's got Kate

08:52.600 --> 08:56.200
but that doesn't make it any easier
for me. I still need him here.

08:56.280 --> 08:59.560
I still remember us like
getting smashed the first night

08:59.640 --> 09:02.200
and Jagerbombs, the gym
and Magaluf and Cancun.

09:02.280 --> 09:05.320
Me and James walked in
the Geordie Shore house together

09:05.400 --> 09:07.800
and we pulled girls together,
we argued.

09:07.880 --> 09:11.400
I've had the biggest fight I've ever
had in this house with James.

09:11.480 --> 09:14.120
But I'm still devastated
that the kid's leaving.

09:16.840 --> 09:21.240
Honestly, all that shit between
anyone, including you, Holly.

09:21.320 --> 09:23.920
I'm just so glad
we're both happy now.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.280
Everybody knows that me and James
have had our ups and downs.

09:27.360 --> 09:30.560
We've been through so much
and at some points we never thought

09:30.640 --> 09:34.240
we'd be friends again. But I'm just
so happy that now we actually are.

09:34.320 --> 09:36.240
I know I'm getting upset and that now

09:36.320 --> 09:40.320
but that's purely just because
of all the good times we've all had.

09:40.400 --> 09:45.640
Seeing everyone so upset made me
realise just how much I mean to them

09:45.720 --> 09:47.720
as they do to me.

09:52.720 --> 09:55.800
It's James' last ever night
in the Geordie Shore house.

09:55.880 --> 09:59.040
I'm gonna make sure that kid
goes out with a bang.

09:59.120 --> 10:03.000
I can't wait to spend me last night
with everyone I love.

10:05.440 --> 10:06.440
Let's do it.

10:09.480 --> 10:11.160
Everyone looks class tonight.

10:11.240 --> 10:14.280
I just can't wait to give James
the best party of his life.

10:14.360 --> 10:17.120
Let's all have a wicked time.
We all look amazing.

10:17.200 --> 10:21.200
Let's just have an absolutely
wicked night for James.

10:21.280 --> 10:25.280
(Charlotte)Let's get mortal!
Mortal! Mortal!

10:25.360 --> 10:28.240
Mortal! Mortal! (trills)

10:38.680 --> 10:40.400
Everyone is starting to arrive.

10:40.480 --> 10:43.120
I cannot wait
to get this fucking party started!

10:58.280 --> 11:00.920
The party's going fucking mint
but Kate's here

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
and I need to pull her to one side
and tell her the news.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.400
You alright?
Yes.

11:05.480 --> 11:08.680
Being in this house has made us
realise what's important.

11:08.760 --> 11:11.640
Being with Kate right now
is my number-one priority.

11:27.280 --> 11:31.560
I really struggled earlier
telling the rest of the house.

11:31.640 --> 11:35.000
But now I feel like a weight's
been lifted off my shoulders

11:35.080 --> 11:37.720
and I can concentrate on
the rest of me life and her.

11:49.680 --> 11:51.840
(Marnie) I'm so excited to see Dan.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.800
I can't wait to introduce him.

11:53.880 --> 11:57.000
Charlotte! This is Dan!
How ya doin'? How are you?

11:57.080 --> 11:59.880
Nice to meet ya.
You look lovely, Dan.

11:59.960 --> 12:03.080
Marnie's boyfriend is here
and she hasn't introduced me.

12:03.160 --> 12:07.400
I get it. if I'd brought a girl in
I wouldn't introduce her to Marnie.

12:19.040 --> 12:22.520
Me and Gary are about to play
Pin the Parsnip on the Gary game.

12:22.600 --> 12:26.800
Nobody knows this but I secretly did
it because I do want to kiss Gary.

12:31.480 --> 12:34.040
I don't know what has got
into Charlotte tonight

12:34.120 --> 12:36.480
but she has been all over us.

12:40.560 --> 12:43.800
He won't kiss me and
he isn't kissing any other girls.

12:43.880 --> 12:45.280
I don't get it.

12:51.400 --> 12:55.560
I'm looking at Holly talking to one
of my ex bangs and shitting myself.

13:04.640 --> 13:07.600
I've tried for so long
not to be a jealous person.

13:07.680 --> 13:10.000
This is a perfect opportunity
to tell Kyle

13:10.080 --> 13:13.800
that I'm talking to these girls, one
of them has said she's slept with ya

13:13.880 --> 13:15.000
and I'm not bothered.

13:22.080 --> 13:25.000
I'm telling him that I've been
talking to his friends

13:25.080 --> 13:27.280
and he looks really angry.
What the fuck?

13:36.480 --> 13:38.760
Holly jumps straight in
with the reaction

13:38.840 --> 13:42.120
that her ex-bangs are here as well.
This isn't a competition.

13:51.920 --> 13:55.480
What the fuck? When I get jealous,
he gets pissed off,

13:55.560 --> 14:00.000
when I try and make an effort
or make a joke he gets pissed off.

14:00.080 --> 14:02.520
I cannot do right
for doing wrong tonight.

14:10.200 --> 14:12.000
Holly's behaviour is immature.

14:12.080 --> 14:15.000
I'm just gonna try me hardest
to stay away from her.

14:25.280 --> 14:28.840
It's been a wicked party but now
it's time for everybody to leave.

14:38.640 --> 14:41.040
I've had the most unbelievable
send off ever.

14:41.120 --> 14:45.800
But I do think it's really important
I finish my last night how I started,

14:45.880 --> 14:48.080
just me and the Geordie Shore family.

14:48.880 --> 14:52.840
One minute I'm happy and then
the next I'm sobbing like a baby.

14:52.920 --> 14:55.120
It's really hit us
that James is leaving.

15:06.120 --> 15:09.320
I've missed Dan so much.
We've had such a good time tonight.

15:09.400 --> 15:11.960
I'm so horny.
I just wanna have sex with him.

15:20.440 --> 15:23.240
I cannot stand going to bed
on an argument.

15:23.320 --> 15:27.600
I don't know what I've done wrong
and all I wanna do is sort it out.

15:27.680 --> 15:31.360
I don't know what you want me to say.
I don't want you to say anything.

15:31.440 --> 15:35.040
I do wanna sort things out but
I just can't have this argument now.

15:35.120 --> 15:36.800
I'm too pissed and too angry.

15:36.880 --> 15:40.520
I thought you were OK with it
and I'm sorry that you weren't

15:40.600 --> 15:44.440
but I didn't know.
But the last thing I wanted was this.

15:44.520 --> 15:47.600
You're literally the best thing
that's happened to us

15:47.680 --> 15:49.000
in a fucking long time.

15:49.080 --> 15:52.280
The only thing I've ever tried
to do is literally protect ya.

15:52.360 --> 15:55.440
Holly saying I'm the best thing
that's ever happened to her

15:55.520 --> 15:58.440
does make me realise
that I do really care about her.

15:58.520 --> 16:01.000
I just wanna stop
this stupid argument now.

16:07.480 --> 16:09.520
We'll sort it out tomorrow.

16:25.680 --> 16:28.600
So I finally get to bed
but to be honest it doesn't look

16:28.680 --> 16:30.680
like I'm gonna get
any sleep tonight.

16:30.760 --> 16:31.760
(moaning)

16:33.480 --> 16:35.760
Aaron's grunting and snoring on.

16:35.840 --> 16:39.160
He's half a-fucking-wake.
He doesn't even know where he is.

16:40.880 --> 16:44.520
He must be sleep walking but why the
hell is he taking his pants down?

16:49.080 --> 16:51.880
What the fuck are you doing?
That's not the toilet,

16:51.960 --> 16:53.600
it's your fucking suitcase!

17:00.600 --> 17:04.640
Typical night. Everyone's fucking
mortal, I've said me final farewells

17:04.720 --> 17:07.640
and Aaron's pissed in his suitcase.
Fucking mess.

17:28.840 --> 17:31.880
Last night was my final night
in Geordie Shore

17:31.960 --> 17:33.840
and we had
an unbelievable house party.

17:33.920 --> 17:36.840
You were in a fucking bad way
last night.

17:37.840 --> 17:39.160
(laughter)

17:39.240 --> 17:41.680
I told James I'll give him
a night to remember

17:41.760 --> 17:44.840
and what funnier than me
pissing in me own suitcase?

17:44.920 --> 17:46.320
You're welcome, mate!

18:01.120 --> 18:04.560
Me and this lot have been through
so much together.

18:04.640 --> 18:08.160
We've had loads of arguments but
we've also had loads of good times.

18:08.240 --> 18:11.080
That's the one thing
that I'll take away with us.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.760
(Marnie) Morning.
Morning.

18:16.840 --> 18:19.960
It's a sad day today.
James.

18:20.040 --> 18:24.240
It is horrible to know that James is
gonna leave the house for good.

18:24.320 --> 18:27.040
I don't know how we're all
gonna cope without him.

18:29.840 --> 18:31.840
It doesn't seem real.

18:33.560 --> 18:37.280
Today's the day where James has
to go and I just can't believe it.

18:37.360 --> 18:40.040
I'm so glad last night was
the best house party.

18:40.120 --> 18:42.920
It was the best send off
you could possibly have.

18:47.120 --> 18:49.760
Right, that's it. Me bags are packed.

18:49.840 --> 18:52.480
I feel like I'm ready
to say me last goodbyes.

18:52.560 --> 18:55.560
But I've gotta feeling that everyone
is gonna miss us.

18:55.640 --> 18:57.760
So I've got one more surprise
for them.

18:57.840 --> 19:01.720
Oi-oi! Everyone,
we've got a new housemate.

19:01.800 --> 19:03.240
What?

19:03.320 --> 19:06.080
Shit!
James has brought a new housemate.

19:06.160 --> 19:08.160
I don't think I'm ready for this.

19:10.400 --> 19:12.960
What the hell?! A new housemate?
No way!

19:20.760 --> 19:23.560
Phew! It's just a cardboard cut-out
of James.

19:23.640 --> 19:25.680
It'll be like he's never gone.

19:25.760 --> 19:27.560
That is hilarious!

19:28.480 --> 19:31.600
I'm proper confused.
I can't tell which one's which.

19:31.680 --> 19:33.840
You can just go and talk to us.

19:36.920 --> 19:40.800
Fuck knows where they're gonna put
this cut-out. It's fucking massive.

19:45.960 --> 19:47.280
Say goodbye to the room.

19:47.360 --> 19:50.080
The amount of memories
that's happened in here.

19:50.160 --> 19:52.680
James has packed his bags
and he's ready to go.

19:52.760 --> 19:55.360
I'll be honest, I'm fucking gutted.

19:55.440 --> 19:56.520
It's that time.

19:56.960 --> 19:58.560
You gonna be all right, yeah?

19:59.680 --> 20:01.880
This is it. James is actually going

20:01.960 --> 20:05.160
and now it's hitting us all
really hard.

20:07.560 --> 20:12.320
It feels weird waving James off.
He was like part of the furniture.

20:12.400 --> 20:13.760
I'll see ya later.

20:15.760 --> 20:16.760
I will.

20:16.840 --> 20:20.360
James was always the person
who I would speak to if I was upset.

20:20.440 --> 20:22.760
He was always there for us
if I was ever down.

20:22.840 --> 20:25.480
I just don't know
how I'm gonna cope without him.

20:28.240 --> 20:30.000
I still remember when I walked in.

20:30.080 --> 20:32.800
He was standing there with
my first ever Jagerbomb.

20:32.880 --> 20:35.200
I'm watching him leave a man.
That's crazy.

20:35.280 --> 20:37.480
You as well.
Bye, James.

20:37.560 --> 20:39.040
I'll miss ya.
I'll miss you.

20:39.120 --> 20:41.520
We started this journey together

20:41.600 --> 20:46.960
and to lose someone who you started
it with is never a nice experience.

20:47.880 --> 20:48.880
Exactly.

20:48.960 --> 20:53.320
We walked into this house together.
At one point we were close friends.

20:53.400 --> 20:56.280
I'm just really sad that he's going.

21:00.160 --> 21:03.640
It's that time already.
It's crazy, isn't it?

21:03.720 --> 21:07.200
Definitely one of the best-looking
lads in Newcastle.

21:07.280 --> 21:09.880
Hi, handsome. You all right?
Decent, innit?

21:09.960 --> 21:12.080
Time to smash it Geordie Shore style.

21:15.680 --> 21:17.360
Let's get fucking mortal!

21:19.440 --> 21:20.480
Mint!

21:24.920 --> 21:27.480
Me biceps feel like
they're getting bigger!

21:28.560 --> 21:31.200
Me full time occupation's
smashing birds.

21:34.320 --> 21:37.000
She's looking for cock.
Preferably my cock.

21:40.320 --> 21:43.760
I'm the only person in this house
to make a relationship work.

21:49.240 --> 21:50.440
Come on!

21:53.680 --> 21:55.840
Fucking hell!

21:56.600 --> 21:58.320
To family.

22:00.920 --> 22:04.160
I look like a giant piece of shit.

22:07.760 --> 22:10.480
All I've ever known is Geordie Shore.

22:10.560 --> 22:14.760
And now I'm actually a bit excited
to see what's next.

22:26.160 --> 22:28.160
And then there was seven.

22:28.240 --> 22:31.720
The house will be different cos
you haven't got that middle person

22:31.800 --> 22:35.720
that the girls can talk to and
the boys. Now it'll just be carnage.

22:46.160 --> 22:50.800
The argument that me and Holly had
last night was totally unnecessary.

22:57.360 --> 23:01.120
I need you to just admit
when you're wrong sometimes.

23:01.200 --> 23:05.360
Last night I wasn't prying
so when I tell ya that I wasn't

23:05.440 --> 23:08.040
you just need to say sorry.
I thought you were.

23:08.120 --> 23:11.160
It's so important for Kyle
to admit when he's in the wrong.

23:11.240 --> 23:13.040
Sometimes all it takes is a sorry.

23:13.120 --> 23:16.280
I can't be spoke to like that again.
No.

23:16.360 --> 23:17.640
OK?
Yeah.

23:17.720 --> 23:21.080
I'm used to walking all over birds.
Holly doesn't stand for it.

23:21.160 --> 23:22.760
That's what I love about her.

23:22.840 --> 23:24.520
I still feel it's the right thing

23:24.600 --> 23:27.360
us not saying that we're boyfriend
and girlfriend.

23:27.440 --> 23:30.480
Yeah, definitely.
Especially after last night.

23:30.560 --> 23:36.040
I feel like having that label
takes things a massive step forward.

23:36.120 --> 23:37.800
I'm glad we're on the same page.

23:37.880 --> 23:41.840
I'm petrified because I've never
had a proper girlfriend before.

23:52.560 --> 23:55.480
I feel better for having
this conversation with Holly.

23:55.560 --> 23:58.760
Hopefully we can not fall out again.

24:03.240 --> 24:05.440
It's our first night back
at Tash On Tours

24:05.520 --> 24:07.280
and we're gonna do what we do best.

24:07.360 --> 24:10.160
Get people necking on,
get pissed and do Anna proud.

24:11.160 --> 24:15.080
Me, Marnie, Gaz and Aaron.
Ready, let's fucking do this.

24:15.160 --> 24:17.520
See youse later.
(woman)Bye!

24:24.640 --> 24:26.920
Me, Scott and Charlotte
are getting ready.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.920
It's nice to not be at work.
Tonight is gonna be wicked.

24:34.320 --> 24:36.520
I'm just chillin' in the house.

24:38.400 --> 24:41.440
Who the fuck is that on my lawn?

24:44.160 --> 24:45.800
That's a car door.

24:45.880 --> 24:47.800
(doorbell)

24:47.880 --> 24:50.960
The doorbell's going.
Has someone forgot their key?

24:51.960 --> 24:53.040
Hello?

24:53.120 --> 24:55.200
I can hear a boy's voice.

24:56.160 --> 24:59.160
What the hell?
< Hiya.

24:59.240 --> 25:02.040
Oh, my God! There's a new boy.

25:02.960 --> 25:05.280
Hi!
How ya doin'? Are ya all right?

25:05.360 --> 25:07.880
This means new person to kiss,
to fancy,

25:07.960 --> 25:10.000
new person to spoon,
to have sex with!

25:10.080 --> 25:12.680
I'm Nathan.
Welcome to Geordie Shore, kid!

25:12.760 --> 25:16.480
We've gotta a new housemate
and what a buzz for him

25:16.560 --> 25:19.360
when the first person he meets
is Scotty fucking T.

25:19.440 --> 25:21.280
And who are you, Nathan?
Nathan.

25:21.360 --> 25:23.440
Why are you here?
The new guy.

25:25.040 --> 25:26.800
My name's Nathan, I'm 23.

25:26.880 --> 25:29.640
I'm flirty and I like to be
the centre of attention.

25:36.640 --> 25:39.000
I'm gonna be cheeky.
I like to wind people up

25:39.080 --> 25:41.520
but who doesn't like
a little bit of trouble?

25:52.400 --> 25:56.000
I love getting absolutely shitfaced,
dance until stupid o'clock

25:56.080 --> 25:57.560
and if I pull it's a bonus.

26:00.280 --> 26:02.400
Geordie Shore house,
I'm ready for ya!

26:02.480 --> 26:04.320
Welcome!
Here's to a good night.

26:04.400 --> 26:06.680
Cheers to the new arrival!

26:06.760 --> 26:10.680
I cannot wait until the others get
back to see we've got a new arrival.

26:10.760 --> 26:14.160
The girls are gonna be jealous
of his perfect eyebrows

26:14.240 --> 26:17.960
and the boys are gonna be jealous
of his wicked looks. He's a winner.

26:21.480 --> 26:25.600
We're gonna do Anna proud and
we're gonna get everybody necking on.

26:25.680 --> 26:28.840
Three, two, one, go!

26:33.160 --> 26:35.680
Me and Aaron are getting on so well.

26:35.760 --> 26:40.160
Because I've got a boyfriend it
means that we can just be friends.

26:48.400 --> 26:50.960
I'm so glad me and Marnie
are sorting things out.

26:51.040 --> 26:54.800
That girl always manages
to put a smile on me face.

26:57.480 --> 26:58.680
What?
Do you?

26:58.760 --> 26:59.880
No.

26:59.960 --> 27:01.720
No?
No.

27:06.760 --> 27:08.640
That's good. Sound.
Sweet.

27:08.720 --> 27:10.240
So that's not a no then.

27:10.320 --> 27:12.480
Cheers to just being friends.
Cheers.

27:18.160 --> 27:21.840
I'm so happy everyone's being nice.
I feel like I'm gonna fit in.

27:32.480 --> 27:35.680
After Vicky not coming back
and James leaving this is exactly

27:35.760 --> 27:39.600
what the Geordie Shore house needed.
Cheers Anna, you fucking scruff.

27:39.680 --> 27:41.280
Now you're part of the fam...

27:41.360 --> 27:43.280
(doorbell)

27:43.360 --> 27:46.720
What the fuck?
The doorbell's going again.

27:48.160 --> 27:50.240
You have got to be kidding us.

27:50.320 --> 27:51.680
(woman) Oh, hello?

27:51.760 --> 27:54.000
What the fuck?
Oh, my God!

27:54.080 --> 27:58.280
Who? What the fuck is this?

27:58.920 --> 28:01.200
Bambi On Ice has just arrived.

28:01.280 --> 28:03.760
Hi!
Hello. I'm Chloe.

28:03.840 --> 28:04.840
Oh!

28:06.600 --> 28:07.600
Oh, yeah.

28:07.680 --> 28:10.480
I recognise this bird.
I used to get with her ages ago.

28:10.560 --> 28:13.880
She's the last person
that I expect to walk in. Liberty!

28:13.960 --> 28:16.240
I'm Nathan.
Hiya, nice to meet ya.

28:16.320 --> 28:19.240
I've been in 20 minutes
and the new girl stumbles in.

28:19.320 --> 28:21.120
Now I'm not the only newbie.

28:21.200 --> 28:22.840
Hi, Chloe, you OK?

28:24.200 --> 28:26.080
No, are you? You look like it.

28:26.160 --> 28:29.920
Chloe is absolutely hilarious.
I can tell she is gonna be fun.

28:34.560 --> 28:37.960
Someone's gonna have to get me
a translator for this girl

28:38.040 --> 28:42.800
because she is speaking in dolphin.
Only ultrasound could pick this up.

28:43.840 --> 28:47.960
I'm Chloe, I'm 19 years old. I'm
the lightest weight in Newcastle.

28:48.040 --> 28:50.160
Don't drink too much.
No, I won't.

28:50.240 --> 28:52.960
I get drunk off one drink.

28:53.040 --> 28:54.840
Being lightweight's the best.

28:54.920 --> 28:57.760
I went out with a fiver
and come back with a tenner once.

28:57.840 --> 29:01.040
I'm gonna come back a woman.
I'm gonna be able to cook, clean.

29:01.120 --> 29:03.000
I'm gonna be like a receptionist.

29:03.080 --> 29:05.640
You're gonna be proud.
Hey, fold that for us.

29:05.720 --> 29:07.520
I think my role in the house will be

29:07.600 --> 29:11.160
how you've got like a peasant
and you've got like a lower peasant.

29:11.240 --> 29:13.240
I wanna be at the higher peasant.

29:13.320 --> 29:15.560
A better peasant
than the lower peasant.

29:15.640 --> 29:19.760
I'm feeling a little bit nervous
cos what if no-one likes us?

29:19.840 --> 29:22.760
I don't wanna be left out.
You won't be left out.

29:22.840 --> 29:25.160
I think I get on really well
with everyone.

29:25.240 --> 29:27.280
I don't like when people
dirty look ya.

29:27.360 --> 29:29.360
I just dirty look them back.

29:29.440 --> 29:31.200
You're gonna be on your own.

29:31.280 --> 29:34.040
The house will just be like a morgue
when I wake up.

29:34.120 --> 29:37.360
What's a morgue?
It's like where dead people are.

29:37.440 --> 29:41.960
I'm a bit nervous but I'm excited.
I can't wait to get into this house.

29:42.640 --> 29:44.560
What the fuck is going on?

29:44.640 --> 29:48.480
Scott is acting really, really
weirdly, like this is an old friend.

29:48.560 --> 29:50.240
Do youse two know each other?

29:50.320 --> 29:53.440
He fancied me and I pied him.
No!

29:53.520 --> 29:57.000
Me and Scott have messed around
a bit but that was ages ago.

30:02.440 --> 30:05.000
Hold on, you're saying
that I used to fancy you

30:05.080 --> 30:07.960
and you pied me.
This bird is a pure crackpot.

30:08.040 --> 30:11.840
She's gonna fit right into
this house with us lunatics.

30:15.080 --> 30:18.880
We need to get back to the house,
get everybody else and get out.

30:30.760 --> 30:31.960
Did you?
Oh, mate!

30:32.040 --> 30:33.160
Hold on a minute.

30:33.240 --> 30:37.320
Immaculate eyebrows,
really well-dressed, a hairdresser?

30:38.280 --> 30:39.320
Is Nathan...?

30:39.400 --> 30:40.840
(girls) Oh, yes!

30:44.400 --> 30:46.400
I am bisexual
but it doesn't define us.

30:46.480 --> 30:47.920
I'm 70% guys and 30% girls

30:48.000 --> 30:50.760
but once I've had a drink
anything could happen.

30:50.840 --> 30:52.880
Let's go upstairs. Come on, Chloe.

30:52.960 --> 30:56.920
Me head's fucked. We've not just got
one new person but now I've got two.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.040
This night is gonna be wild.

31:02.440 --> 31:05.320
Like, stuff did happen
but we haven't had sex yet.

31:05.400 --> 31:08.560
Bit of suckie-suckie?
No, I don't like it. I swear to God.

31:08.640 --> 31:10.480
You don't like it?

31:13.600 --> 31:17.960
She's got history with Scott and even
though they didn't sleep together

31:18.040 --> 31:20.920
I think there's a strong possibility
that they will.

31:25.760 --> 31:28.000
Did this just happen downstairs?
Yeah.

31:28.080 --> 31:30.360
What the fuck?
How did I miss all of this?

31:30.440 --> 31:34.320
Great! Nathan's bi. Not only have
I gotta fight the girls for him

31:34.400 --> 31:38.640
I've got to fight the boys.
Good job I'm strong as fuck!

31:46.800 --> 31:48.840
When they come you should be hidden.

31:48.920 --> 31:52.560
None of the others know
that these new people are here

31:52.640 --> 31:55.400
so we're gonna give them
the shock of their lives!

31:56.760 --> 32:00.800
Shh! That's them, that's them,
that's them. Get your cases.

32:00.880 --> 32:04.160
I'm dead nervous
but I'm so excited at the same time.

32:05.440 --> 32:10.200
The others literally don't have a
clue. This is gonna be hilarious.

32:11.040 --> 32:15.240
Oh, finally!
Here's the work posse!

32:18.640 --> 32:20.200
As if I'm not nervous enough

32:20.280 --> 32:23.240
my fucking fanny has slipped out
me under-crackers.

32:23.320 --> 32:26.080
How was work?
Are youse mortal?

32:26.160 --> 32:29.560
We get back and everyone's
acting weird. Something's going on.

32:35.200 --> 32:38.760
What the fuck?! Two new people
have just burst out the bedroom.

32:38.840 --> 32:39.840
Hello!

32:40.880 --> 32:44.400
Hello, I'm Chloe, nice to meet ya.
Nice to meet ya, you all right?

32:44.480 --> 32:47.480
I can't believe that there's
two new people in the house.

32:47.560 --> 32:49.760
They've jumped in James' grave
so quick.

32:49.840 --> 32:52.880
Can you believe it, though?
Can you believe it?!

32:52.960 --> 32:56.880
Everyone has got the shock of their
lives. Tonight is gonna be wicked.

32:56.960 --> 33:01.560
I think we should have a toast to
the two newbies, Nathan and Chloe.

33:01.640 --> 33:05.560
Welcome! Let's get fuckin' mortal!

33:05.640 --> 33:07.880
Up the fucking Geordie Shore.

33:15.760 --> 33:21.000
We are gonna show these two newbies
how to party Geordie Shore style.

33:23.240 --> 33:26.360
I'm so excited
to get hammered with everyone.

33:26.440 --> 33:29.600
Right, new boy, new girl,
so we're gonna have to make tonight

33:29.680 --> 33:33.040
a night to fucking remember.
So let's give a big cheers!

33:42.200 --> 33:44.320
It's Chloe and Nathan's
first night out.

33:44.400 --> 33:48.240
We're gonna take them to Madam Koo's
and get them fucked up.

33:55.240 --> 33:58.600
Drinks are getting poured,
music's loud, everyone's buzzing.

33:58.680 --> 34:00.720
Bring it on!

34:06.320 --> 34:09.600
We're having a wicked time
and I'm fucking buzzing.

34:18.320 --> 34:21.360
He is good-looking but
I don't think I could kiss anyone

34:21.440 --> 34:23.320
with a better complexion than mine.

34:29.840 --> 34:34.120
I am bisexual. I like boys and I like
girls. I just think I'm greedy.

34:47.040 --> 34:51.160
Aaron and Kyle? I had Nathan
more down as a Scott person meself.

34:58.640 --> 35:01.920
I'm buzzing that Nathan thinks
I'm fit but I'm not so buzzing

35:02.000 --> 35:04.840
that I have to share him
with Marnie, Aaron and Kyle.

35:13.840 --> 35:15.960
Everyone's having
a fucking mint time.

35:16.040 --> 35:18.160
The newbies are getting stuck in.

35:26.920 --> 35:29.760
Charlotte told me and Aaron
that Nathan's bisexual.

35:29.840 --> 35:32.600
Fair play to the kid.
Having the best of both worlds!

35:39.240 --> 35:41.200
If Nathan fancies me,
what can I say?

35:41.280 --> 35:43.280
He's obviously got
a good taste in men.

35:50.960 --> 35:53.720
I'm showing the boys me dance moves.

36:08.440 --> 36:12.360
We've had some mad people
live in this house

36:12.440 --> 36:14.720
but this new girl is on cloud cuckoo!

36:21.200 --> 36:25.040
Charlotte must be absolutely smashed
cos she's asleep in the corner.

36:31.040 --> 36:33.400
Fuck know what's happened to me
tonight.

36:33.480 --> 36:37.000
I feel like I've woken up in
the past. Marnie is all over Gary.

36:39.400 --> 36:42.920
I know I'm being crazy
but Gary and Marnie have got history

36:43.000 --> 36:45.400
and tonight
it's really upsetting us.

36:48.040 --> 36:51.640
All of a sudden Charlotte's crying
and I don't know what to do.

36:54.840 --> 36:58.680
Charlotte won't even talk to anyone.
What the hell is up with her?

37:01.520 --> 37:03.120
I can't hold it in any longer.

37:03.200 --> 37:06.320
Crazy Charlotte's here.
I'm like a bull to a red Marnie.

37:11.840 --> 37:15.000
What the actual fuck? I go over
to Charlotte to ask if she's OK

37:15.080 --> 37:18.320
and then she goes for me.
I've done absolutely nothing wrong.

37:22.720 --> 37:25.320
I don't know what's going on
with Charlotte.

37:25.400 --> 37:27.240
She's proper foaming at the mouth.

37:27.320 --> 37:29.720
She looks like she's even got rabies.
Maybes.

37:33.520 --> 37:36.720
The only thing that I can think
why Charlotte would kick off

37:36.800 --> 37:41.680
is because I was dancing with Gary.
But I was dancing with everyone.

37:43.840 --> 37:46.280
I can't believe it.
They're like wild animals.

37:50.400 --> 37:52.960
I'm so furious over
what Charlotte has done

37:53.040 --> 37:54.960
then Holly started to mouth off.

37:55.040 --> 37:56.040
Fuck off!

38:02.840 --> 38:07.200
This is isn't my argument. What the
fuck are ya talking about, Marnie?

38:07.280 --> 38:09.160
I just said, let you deal with it.

38:09.240 --> 38:12.960
But it's your fucking attitude.
You cheeky little cow.

38:13.040 --> 38:16.720
The last thing I'm gonna do tonight
is take shit off Holly as well.

38:16.800 --> 38:20.560
Oh, come and say that to me face.
I've just said it to ya face,
Marnie.

38:20.640 --> 38:23.080
Well, come here and say it.
I will not kid you.

38:23.160 --> 38:25.160
Walk around here and fucking say it.

38:25.240 --> 38:28.880
Marnie is taking this too far
and I am not fucking having it.

38:31.440 --> 38:34.640
As if Marnie has just swirled Holly.
Are you fucking kidding?

38:38.440 --> 38:40.640
Don't you fucking ever! Ever!

38:40.720 --> 38:43.000
They start getting
stuck into each other.

38:43.080 --> 38:46.720
The fucking dicks. I hope
the newbies had a wicked night.

38:46.800 --> 38:49.960
(arguing)

38:50.040 --> 38:53.160
I was the one telling ya not to worry
and what do I get for it?

38:53.240 --> 38:55.040
A fucking drink in me face.

38:58.440 --> 39:00.320
Nathan's absolutely obliterated.

39:00.400 --> 39:02.600
We have to get him in a taxi
and get him home.

39:02.680 --> 39:04.640
Tonight was a total disaster.

39:10.840 --> 39:13.680
We get home and the others
haven't arrived back yet.

39:13.760 --> 39:17.080
Thank fuck for that. Marnie should
not have gone on like that.

39:18.240 --> 39:21.760
I don't know what the fuck's going
on but I'm too pissed to even care.

39:21.840 --> 39:24.640
Thank God for Kyle
for putting us to bed.

39:26.520 --> 39:30.920
It was Chloe and Nathan's first
night but it was just shit.

39:31.000 --> 39:34.560
I don't want to stay in this house.
I don't wanna stay here either.

39:34.640 --> 39:36.400
Fuck that.
Do ya wanna go to yours?

39:36.920 --> 39:41.760
I can't help feel bad that I ruined
Chloe and Nathan's first night.

39:41.840 --> 39:45.440
The best thing we can do right now
is leave and not see the others.

39:52.640 --> 39:56.240
We get back and Charlotte,
Holly and Kyle aren't there.

39:56.320 --> 39:58.680
After tonight,
it's probably the best.

40:01.040 --> 40:03.920
Tonight I've had a massive argument
with Charlotte,

40:04.000 --> 40:06.880
a massive argument with Holly.
I just wanna go to bed.

40:06.960 --> 40:12.080
I was having such a good time.
I hope stuff gets sorted tomorrow.

40:12.160 --> 40:14.160
Why are youse on the floor?

40:15.720 --> 40:18.720
We get upstairs and find Nathan
passed out on the deck.

40:18.800 --> 40:21.760
I cannot believe no-one showed him
where the toilet is

40:21.840 --> 40:24.040
cos he's using his fucking trousers.

40:57.520 --> 40:57.720
.
