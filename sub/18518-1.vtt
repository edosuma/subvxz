WEBVTT

04:14.021 --> 04:17.921
- Can you make out the beacon light?
- Not yet.

04:18.108 --> 04:22.540
- About time we came up with it.
- Look to starboard.

04:28.953 --> 04:30.350
Where?

04:30.455 --> 04:32.394
I've lost it. It's gone.
Did you see it?

04:32.498 --> 04:34.584
No.

04:35.126 --> 04:37.664
Nothing there.

05:19.545 --> 05:21.631
Argh.

05:24.592 --> 05:26.881
Argh.

05:27.053 --> 05:30.911
Tell 'em to make sure no-one
gets clear of the wreck.

05:31.015 --> 05:33.101
No-one, d'you hear?

06:36.330 --> 06:39.664
That's all.
Load up the horses.

06:39.834 --> 06:41.398
Carry the rest yourselves.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.358
Come on.

06:47.133 --> 06:49.364
Get the stuff up to the inn.

06:49.469 --> 06:51.074
Come on.

06:51.179 --> 06:53.848
Come along now.

06:58.311 --> 07:00.334
You're sure no-one got away?

07:00.438 --> 07:02.461
You can reckon on that, Joss.

07:02.565 --> 07:04.588
Aye, you can reckon on that.

07:04.692 --> 07:06.778
Joss.

07:07.153 --> 07:09.238
Help.

07:13.326 --> 07:15.349
I told you to make certain,
you fool.

07:15.453 --> 07:17.476
Can't you use your eyes?

07:17.580 --> 07:20.682
Do you want the
lot of us to swing?

08:08.214 --> 08:10.320
I don't like it.
I don't like it at all.

08:10.425 --> 08:12.573
- That place gives me the creeps.
- Eh?

08:12.677 --> 08:15.200
That place. Jamaica Inn.
It's got a bad name.

08:15.304 --> 08:19.121
It's not healthy, that's why.
There's queer things goes on there.

08:19.225 --> 08:25.695
Queer things. I won't stop there, not
if she were to offer me double fare.

08:35.158 --> 08:37.639
Is Jamaica Inn on this road?

08:41.164 --> 08:43.249
Yes.

08:51.966 --> 08:54.197
How much further
is Jamaica Inn?

08:54.302 --> 08:56.544
Come on. Come on.

08:59.557 --> 09:01.642
Come on. Gee up.

09:01.684 --> 09:05.500
Why are we going so fast? What's
happened? Have the horses bolted?

09:05.605 --> 09:07.544
It's Jamaica Inn.

09:07.648 --> 09:09.671
But this is where
I want to get out.

09:09.776 --> 09:12.633
Hi, coachman. Why don't you
stop? I want to get out.

09:12.737 --> 09:15.510
Coachman, listen to me,
you fool. Pull up at once.

09:15.615 --> 09:19.692
Why don't you stop, you fool?
Stop, I tell you.

09:25.625 --> 09:27.710
Whoa.

09:32.673 --> 09:34.696
Why didn't you stop?
Are you deaf?

09:34.801 --> 09:36.865
I've been shouting
myself silly.

09:36.969 --> 09:39.660
You've taken me past Jamaica
Inn. Take me back at once.

09:39.764 --> 09:43.872
You'd better try Squire Pengallan's instead.
They say he's partial to young women.

09:43.976 --> 09:46.598
Here's your box. Gee up.

10:17.468 --> 10:19.908
I think we owe a
toast to Sir Humphrey.

10:20.012 --> 10:22.098
Sir Humphrey.

10:23.182 --> 10:25.268
Eh? What?

10:25.309 --> 10:27.395
Jove, yes.

10:27.437 --> 10:29.042
Pengallan.

10:29.147 --> 10:30.335
Thank you.

10:30.440 --> 10:32.412
Might have asked you
to drink the health of

10:32.517 --> 10:34.631
His brand-new Majesty
George IV, but I forgot.

10:34.736 --> 10:38.093
Fact is, I haven't been on speaking
terms for years with the fat fool.

10:38.197 --> 10:41.096
You were much in his company
at one time, Sir Humphrey.

10:41.200 --> 10:43.045
When Charlie Fox and
Sheridan would...

10:43.149 --> 10:45.392
...be there with him in
the Pavilion at Brighton.

10:45.496 --> 10:47.644
In those days he was
still a gentleman.

10:47.749 --> 10:50.939
Now he's nothing but a painted bag
of maraschino and plum pudding.

10:51.044 --> 10:53.567
Last summer we made
a tour of the lakes.

10:53.671 --> 10:56.445
Which lake do you admire
the most, Sir Humphrey?

10:56.549 --> 10:58.634
Chadwick.

11:03.431 --> 11:05.454
Which lake did I
admire the most?

11:05.558 --> 11:07.581
- Windermere, sir.
- Windermere.

11:07.685 --> 11:11.668
It is very beautiful. Why not a
toast to beauty, Sir Humphrey?

11:11.773 --> 11:13.858
Why not?

11:13.900 --> 11:15.985
Chadwick, my figurine.

11:16.027 --> 11:18.420
I need inspiration, by gad.

11:21.115 --> 11:24.014
- Oh, there's beauty.
- But it's not alive.

11:24.118 --> 11:29.525
It's more alive than half the
people here. Look at them, what?

11:30.041 --> 11:33.315
You want to see beauty alive?
Chadwick.

11:33.419 --> 11:35.442
Ask Sam how long
Nancy's going to be.

11:35.546 --> 11:36.589
Nancy?

11:36.693 --> 11:38.070
The most beautiful
creature west of Exeter.

11:38.174 --> 11:41.031
That's why he stays here and
never comes to London any more.

11:41.135 --> 11:42.741
He keeps a girl here,
the monster.

11:42.845 --> 11:45.994
- Then I prefer not to make her acquaintance.
- No. I'm curious.

11:46.099 --> 11:47.913
Yes, by Jove.

11:48.017 --> 11:50.103
Have her in, Pengallan.

11:50.228 --> 11:52.313
Here she is.

11:52.355 --> 11:54.440
My exquisite Nancy.

12:07.829 --> 12:09.851
Brought me in a hundred
guineas yesterday.

12:09.956 --> 12:11.792
Ran away with the
Bodmin Steeplechase,

12:11.896 --> 12:13.981
didn't you, my dear?
Chadwick, what's that?

12:14.085 --> 12:15.482
It's a woman, sir.

12:15.586 --> 12:17.985
Don't argue with your women
when I'm entertaining.

12:18.089 --> 12:19.780
The coachman left me stranded.

12:19.884 --> 12:21.905
Ask your master to lend
me a horse and trap.

12:22.009 --> 12:23.246
Let's have a look at her.

12:23.350 --> 12:25.617
Ringwood, bet you 20-1
in guineas she's ugly.

12:25.722 --> 12:27.807
I'll take you.

12:47.243 --> 12:48.849
Would you er...

12:48.953 --> 12:52.185
...oblige me by taking off
that coat for a moment?

12:52.290 --> 12:53.812
Why should I?

12:53.916 --> 12:55.731
I have a wager here.

12:55.835 --> 12:57.649
Always respect a wager.

12:57.754 --> 12:59.839
Would you allow me?

13:04.552 --> 13:06.575
But you're an exquisite shape,
too.

13:06.679 --> 13:08.765
My dear,

13:08.806 --> 13:10.892
you're a beauty.

13:10.933 --> 13:13.019
Ringwood.

13:13.061 --> 13:14.666
You've won.

13:14.771 --> 13:16.856
Here y'are.

13:18.733 --> 13:22.382
Look, here.
I say, my bet, you know.

13:22.487 --> 13:25.510
'She walks in beauty
like the night.

13:25.615 --> 13:28.972
Of cloudless climes
and starry skies, hmm?

13:29.077 --> 13:32.267
And all that's best
of dark and bright

13:32.372 --> 13:34.457
Meet in her aspect...

13:36.584 --> 13:38.669
...and her eyes.'

13:38.711 --> 13:42.194
Thank you, sir, but I didn't
come for poetry, but for a horse.

13:42.298 --> 13:44.384
A horse?

13:44.425 --> 13:49.034
Being worthy of Lord Byron's
poetry, you shall have the horse.

13:49.138 --> 13:52.152
My name is Sir
Humphrey Pengallan.

13:52.308 --> 13:55.082
I'm squire of Pengallan
and justice of the peace.

13:55.186 --> 13:57.000
I'm Mary Yellan from Ireland.

13:57.105 --> 13:59.253
- And you're going where?
- To Jamaica Inn.

13:59.357 --> 14:01.442
To Jamaica Inn?

14:01.484 --> 14:03.298
You can't go there.

14:03.403 --> 14:05.488
- Why not?
- Sam.

14:05.530 --> 14:09.429
This young lady wants to know why she
can't go to Jamaica Inn. Tell her.

14:09.534 --> 14:12.724
Ooh, very rough there, miss.
No place for a young lady.

14:12.829 --> 14:15.602
See, even Sam knows that.
No, you better stay here.

14:15.707 --> 14:17.792
No, of course not.

14:17.834 --> 14:21.191
I've come all the way from Ireland
alone, because I've nobody there now.

14:21.295 --> 14:22.693
Your parents?

14:22.797 --> 14:26.280
I'm going to Jamaica Inn, because
my Aunt Patience is there.

14:26.384 --> 14:28.469
What a lovely horse.

14:28.511 --> 14:30.438
Yes. Could you ride her?

14:30.638 --> 14:33.287
Yes, of course. I've been
riding since I was a child.

14:33.391 --> 14:35.330
Well,
you shall ride her to the inn.

14:35.435 --> 14:37.040
Thank you,

14:37.145 --> 14:39.538
but I've got a box outside.

14:39.897 --> 14:41.517
Oh, um... I'll take the box...

14:41.621 --> 14:44.131
...and conduct you myself
to er... your relative.

14:44.235 --> 14:46.425
Sam, saddle the bay as well.

14:46.529 --> 14:47.718
Chadwick.

14:47.822 --> 14:50.804
Chadwick, this is Miss Mary
Yellan who's going to Jamaica Inn.

14:50.908 --> 14:52.598
So she said, sir.
I don't understand.

14:52.702 --> 14:56.101
You've never understood anything,
so why be surprised at yourself now?

14:56.205 --> 14:58.562
Try to understand this.
Miss Yellan is my friend.

14:58.666 --> 15:00.922
If she returns here at
any time, admit her at...

15:01.026 --> 15:03.233
...once. See that she has
everything she requires.

15:03.337 --> 15:07.070
Give me my greatcoat and muffler.
And a thick scarf for this lady.

15:07.175 --> 15:09.260
Pardon me.

15:09.302 --> 15:10.344
Chadwick,

15:10.449 --> 15:12.701
I'll have some hot brandy
when I come back...

15:12.805 --> 15:14.912
...and see that they put
a warming pan in the bed.

15:15.016 --> 15:16.622
Very good, Sir Humphrey.

15:16.726 --> 15:19.499
If you'll wait a moment,
miss, I'll get the scarf.

15:19.604 --> 15:21.997
But I really don't need it.

16:01.479 --> 16:04.002
If I can be of any service,
please command me.

16:04.107 --> 16:08.627
Remember, I'm Pengallan,
and this is Pengallan land.

16:10.154 --> 16:12.177
- Don't forget, now.
- No, I won't.

16:12.281 --> 16:14.304
Good night, Miss er... Yellan.

16:14.409 --> 16:16.624
Good night, Sir Humphrey.

16:48.735 --> 16:50.820
Who's there?

16:52.739 --> 16:54.303
What do you want?

16:54.407 --> 16:56.847
Does Mrs Patience
Merlyn live here?

16:56.951 --> 16:58.557
She might.

16:58.661 --> 17:01.310
And she might not.
Depending on your business.

17:01.414 --> 17:04.438
I'm her niece from Ireland.
You must have heard.

17:04.541 --> 17:07.107
I'm coming to live
with my aunt and uncle.

17:07.211 --> 17:08.650
What?

17:08.755 --> 17:11.403
What put that in your head?
Who told you so, eh?

17:11.507 --> 17:16.116
That's my business. Go and
tell your master I'm here.

17:16.637 --> 17:18.868
Aren't you going to
give me a kiss first?

17:18.973 --> 17:21.568
You'll... You'll suffer
for this when my uncle's...

17:21.673 --> 17:23.957
...told of it. I'll have
you turned out of here.

17:24.061 --> 17:26.835
- You'll see.
- Oh, you wouldn't be hard on us, ma'am.

17:26.939 --> 17:31.637
- You see, your aunt would miss me.
- Get out of my way.

17:32.195 --> 17:34.280
Correct.

17:34.322 --> 17:36.407
Entirely correct.

17:36.449 --> 17:38.472
I'm your aunt's
loving husband,

17:38.576 --> 17:41.577
your great big uncle Joss.

17:41.746 --> 17:42.935
Come on.

17:43.039 --> 17:45.124
Who's there?

17:52.715 --> 17:54.801
There we are.

17:54.842 --> 17:55.989
Aunt Patience.

17:56.094 --> 17:58.715
Mary. Mary, my sister's Mary.

17:58.846 --> 18:02.788
- You know me, then, Aunt Patience?
- Yes, my dear, yes.

18:02.892 --> 18:04.915
You're so like your mother.

18:05.019 --> 18:07.668
When I heard your voice at
first, I thought it was hers.

18:07.772 --> 18:10.295
And then when I saw you,
I thought for the moment...

18:10.400 --> 18:13.945
She said you were
expecting her to stay.

18:14.779 --> 18:16.176
No, Joss, no.

18:16.280 --> 18:18.637
But I wrote to you
telling you everything.

18:18.741 --> 18:20.827
Nothing came.

18:22.412 --> 18:24.497
You wrote...

18:24.539 --> 18:26.353
Mary,

18:26.457 --> 18:28.543
you're in black.

18:28.743 --> 18:30.148
Yes.

18:30.253 --> 18:32.734
Mother died three
weeks ago today.

18:32.839 --> 18:35.320
I'll have a drink.

18:35.967 --> 18:38.052
How did it happen?

18:38.094 --> 18:39.137
She hadn't been well,

18:39.241 --> 18:41.243
but she said she must
leave her bed and work.

18:41.347 --> 18:43.474
You know how Mother was.

18:56.404 --> 18:59.088
Patience. Don't stand
there yappering, woman.

18:59.192 --> 19:00.721
Get the girl's box inside.

19:00.825 --> 19:03.114
Yes. Yes, Joss.

19:03.286 --> 19:05.945
No, no, Aunt Patience, let me.

19:09.083 --> 19:11.169
Easy, easy.

19:11.210 --> 19:13.233
Your new uncle's
very particular.

19:13.337 --> 19:17.529
He's not the sort to let lovely ladies
spoil themselves with rough work.

19:17.633 --> 19:20.824
He knows different, does Joss.
Lively with it, Patience, my dear.

19:20.928 --> 19:24.411
- I'll take this end.
- No. I can manage. It isn't heavy, Mary.

19:24.515 --> 19:27.623
- You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
- Mary, don't say anything.

19:27.727 --> 19:30.667
I've had pretty women
pay me compliments before.

19:30.772 --> 19:32.857
Stand clear there.

19:36.611 --> 19:38.696
There.

19:39.739 --> 19:41.845
Our Mary's a little
bit sour tonight,

19:41.949 --> 19:47.184
but, bless you, the best of us can't
be sweet-tempered on an empty belly.

19:47.288 --> 19:49.374
Fill it up for her.

19:49.415 --> 19:53.106
Yes, I'll get her something to
eat. Mary, if you'll come with me.

19:53.211 --> 19:55.150
I won't be a minute.

19:55.254 --> 19:57.277
If you'll sit down and rest.

19:57.382 --> 19:59.488
- I'll set the table.
- No, no, no, no.

19:59.592 --> 20:01.907
You'll be tired after
your long journey.

20:02.011 --> 20:05.077
I'm not. Where's the
cloth and supper things?

20:05.181 --> 20:08.017
Over there in the
middle drawer.

20:17.318 --> 20:20.023
It's nothing.
Only some late customers...

20:20.127 --> 20:23.303
...in the parlour. They'll
be going soon, no doubt.

20:25.535 --> 20:27.620
Shut that gab.

20:30.790 --> 20:32.875
Keep it quiet.

20:32.917 --> 20:35.607
- You see, boys, we've got a visitor.
- Harry told us.

20:35.712 --> 20:38.005
She's a neat piece from
what I've seen of her.

20:38.110 --> 20:39.152
Very neat.

20:39.257 --> 20:42.197
That's all you think of,
women. Vanities of the flesh.

20:42.301 --> 20:45.701
Following petticoats along the
path to everlasting corruption.

20:45.805 --> 20:48.161
- Salvation's off again.
- You can laugh now.

20:48.266 --> 20:50.289
But you'll sing
a different tune,

20:50.393 --> 20:54.376
when you're roasting in the consuming
fire that's waiting for all of us.

20:54.480 --> 20:56.566
Me included.

20:56.816 --> 20:59.673
- Where are you going, Harry?
- To pay my respects.

20:59.777 --> 21:01.842
She's not partial
to your sort, Harry.

21:01.946 --> 21:05.048
What about me in
my new lace cuffs?

21:05.908 --> 21:07.931
Anything in mind
that way yourself?

21:08.036 --> 21:11.184
Well, I hadn't given the
matter a thought, but I might.

21:11.289 --> 21:13.374
I said I might, Harry.

21:15.084 --> 21:17.170
All right, Joss.

21:17.211 --> 21:20.193
Added to which, she's my
wife's niece from Ireland.

21:20.298 --> 21:21.904
Why didn't you
say that before?

21:22.008 --> 21:23.822
My business, Harry,
my business.

21:23.926 --> 21:25.490
I knew a girl once.

21:25.595 --> 21:28.660
Come from Ireland. Talked funny,
she did. Like a foreigner.

21:28.765 --> 21:30.621
But it was all right.

21:30.725 --> 21:32.331
I'm not what you expected,
am I?

21:32.435 --> 21:35.000
I was only a child when you
went away, Aunt Patience.

21:35.104 --> 21:37.002
I can only just
remember you then.

21:37.106 --> 21:38.712
And what was I like then?

21:38.816 --> 21:40.902
You were beautiful.

21:41.527 --> 21:43.613
Was I?

21:43.654 --> 21:45.427
Yes...

21:45.531 --> 21:46.574
I suppose I was.

21:46.678 --> 21:49.223
No doubt your mother
told you all about me.

21:49.327 --> 21:51.725
You're thinking I'm paid
out for leaving home.

21:51.829 --> 21:53.769
For running away.
Well, you're wrong.

21:53.873 --> 21:57.522
Joss has been a good husband to me.
There's nothing I'd change even if I could.

21:57.627 --> 21:59.650
It's hard work and
it's risky work.

21:59.754 --> 22:02.069
It's work we'll rot
in chains for one day.

22:02.173 --> 22:04.258
All in a neat row.

22:04.300 --> 22:06.740
And what do we get out of it?
Next to nothing.

22:06.844 --> 22:09.251
Why, a man's share
doesn't come to enough...

22:09.355 --> 22:11.036
...to hold body
and soul together.

22:11.140 --> 22:14.748
That last wreck didn't bring in what
it should have. That's what I say.

22:14.852 --> 22:16.458
That's what you say.

22:16.562 --> 22:19.044
No, that's what Sydney said.

22:19.065 --> 22:22.047
- So, you've been yapping, eh?
- No, no, Mr Merlyn, I assure you.

22:22.151 --> 22:24.174
Showing off your arithmetic,
eh?

22:24.278 --> 22:27.678
Doing pretty sums for poor lads
that can't read nor reckon.

22:27.782 --> 22:30.764
You're out to list the goods,
not set a price on them.

22:30.868 --> 22:32.954
Just a minute, Joss.

22:37.834 --> 22:41.525
I told him the last haul didn't fetch
a quarter of what it should have done.

22:41.629 --> 22:43.026
You did, eh?

22:43.131 --> 22:45.153
Reckoning by our share of it,

22:45.258 --> 22:48.448
maybe you're not getting
the right price for the stuff.

22:48.553 --> 22:50.576
Maybe there's a
leak somewhere.

23:01.399 --> 23:03.422
You're looking thoughtful,
Harry.

23:03.526 --> 23:06.800
Perhaps you'll give us the
benefit of your sentiments.

23:06.904 --> 23:08.990
If any.

23:11.117 --> 23:13.140
About this leak,
I think the word is,

23:13.244 --> 23:16.518
if you've a notion in your
mind, Harry, don't be bashful.

23:16.622 --> 23:18.645
Spit it out.
We'd be glad to listen.

23:18.750 --> 23:20.772
I wouldn't know about that,
Joss.

23:20.877 --> 23:23.775
Well, perhaps I would.
Supposing there is a leak.

23:23.880 --> 23:27.863
And supposing it happens before the
goods get to the inn, do you follow me?

23:27.967 --> 23:31.992
Some absent-minded chap
might mislay a piece or two,

23:32.096 --> 23:34.119
in a manner of speaking,

23:34.223 --> 23:36.246
on the way up from the wreck.

23:36.350 --> 23:39.458
Have you ever thought of that?
How long have you been with me?

23:39.562 --> 23:41.668
A matter of five years, Joss.

23:41.773 --> 23:42.753
Salvation?

23:42.857 --> 23:48.795
We've been lost souls together for
two years and seven months, Joss.

23:48.821 --> 23:50.010
Sydney?

23:50.114 --> 23:52.387
Almost two and a half years,
Mr Merlyn.

23:52.492 --> 23:54.431
Dandy?

23:54.535 --> 23:59.561
Let's see, now. I was carrying on with
a bit in Penzance around that time.

23:59.665 --> 24:04.097
Here she is. Annie. That
makes it four years, Joss.

24:04.796 --> 24:06.881
And you?

24:10.843 --> 24:12.929
I'll tell them for you.

24:12.970 --> 24:18.557
Mr Trehearne has been with us
the enormous time of two months.

24:19.727 --> 24:21.542
Eight weeks.

24:21.646 --> 24:23.731
56 days.

24:23.773 --> 24:26.077
How's that for arithmetic?

24:27.944 --> 24:30.676
What do you say to that,
Mr Trehearne?

24:30.780 --> 24:32.865
Joss.

24:33.032 --> 24:35.118
Clear out.

24:38.830 --> 24:40.915
Joss, please.

24:45.712 --> 24:47.797
Why, what's wrong?

24:47.839 --> 24:51.822
Joss, Mary's just told me, she came
to the inn with Squire Pengallan.

24:51.926 --> 24:54.700
He asked her why she was
coming here and about us.

24:54.804 --> 24:57.744
And, seeing he's a magistrate,
I thought...

24:57.849 --> 25:00.998
Joss, you don't think
he's found out anything?

25:01.102 --> 25:04.167
What's this about Sir Humphrey,
eh? How did you come to meet him?

25:04.272 --> 25:07.004
Why, I called on him. The coach
took me a long way past here.

25:07.108 --> 25:09.131
So I went to the
house for help.

25:09.235 --> 25:11.800
Sir Humphrey was very
kind and most obliging.

25:11.904 --> 25:14.052
He knows how to behave
towards a woman.

25:14.157 --> 25:16.179
He even lent me a
horse to ride here.

25:16.284 --> 25:21.690
One that won him a hundred guineas
in the county steeplechase.

25:47.398 --> 25:50.130
We didn't get the haul we
hoped for tonight, sir.

25:50.234 --> 25:57.059
There was a full gale blowing down there
and the ship broke clean in two, sir.

25:59.911 --> 26:01.725
Get a pair of scissors,
Merlyn.

26:01.829 --> 26:03.915
Yes, sir.

26:06.667 --> 26:08.065
Why did you leave
this blood on?

26:08.169 --> 26:11.235
What do you think we're conducting?
A slaughterhouse? Cut it off.

26:11.339 --> 26:13.862
There were so many tumbling
in. It was butcher's work.

26:13.966 --> 26:15.788
What have they to live for,
poor scum?

26:15.892 --> 26:18.158
You were right to put
them out of their misery.

26:18.262 --> 26:20.825
Look at this exquisite stuff.
Worth the miserable...

26:20.930 --> 26:22.788
...lives of a hundred
rum-rotten sailors.

26:22.892 --> 26:26.041
Perfection of its own kind.
That's all that matters, Merlyn.

26:26.145 --> 26:28.168
Whatever is perfect
of its kind.

26:28.272 --> 26:31.547
I'd transport all the riffraff
in Bristol to Botany Bay...

26:31.651 --> 26:34.633
...to save one beautiful
woman a single headache.

26:34.737 --> 26:36.885
Something you don't
understand. Never will.

26:36.989 --> 26:39.721
Because you're neither
a philosopher nor a gentleman.

26:39.826 --> 26:42.558
- But you made certain, no survivors?
- Certain sure, sir.

26:42.662 --> 26:45.769
I'm sorry about that girl Mary,
sir. We didn't know she was coming.

26:45.873 --> 26:48.230
She'll be no harm. I'll get
her away in the morning.

26:48.334 --> 26:49.606
Make up the fire. It's cold.

26:49.711 --> 26:52.015
- Get me a drink.
- Yes, sir.

26:53.506 --> 26:56.989
I didn't expect you so soon, sir,
before I'd put the light in the window.

26:57.093 --> 26:59.199
A man's a fool to stir
out on a night like this.

26:59.303 --> 27:00.753
Taking a bit of a risk,
wasn't it,

27:00.857 --> 27:02.703
coming before I got
the men out of the way?

27:02.807 --> 27:04.621
Everything's a risk.

27:04.726 --> 27:07.457
This girl, Mary, not without
character. A mind of her own.

27:07.562 --> 27:08.824
Oh, you leave her to me, sir.

27:08.928 --> 27:10.961
I'll manage her,
just as I manage my Patience.

27:11.065 --> 27:14.423
- Have you looked at the stuff?
- I don't see any resemblance to your wife.

27:14.527 --> 27:15.894
Maybe not,
but my Patience was...

27:15.998 --> 27:17.968
...a bit of a beauty when
I married her. Why, I...

27:18.072 --> 27:20.137
This won't do, Merlyn.
It's not enough.

27:20.241 --> 27:24.224
No, sir, it's not quite what we looked for.
Better luck next time, eh, Sir Humphrey?

27:24.328 --> 27:26.685
We could do with it.
The men are getting impatient.

27:26.789 --> 27:30.480
I can deal with them, but they're asking
where the money goes. They want more.

27:30.585 --> 27:33.984
What for? Rot their innards out sooner
with the blue ruin you sell 'em?

27:34.088 --> 27:36.111
Listen, Merlyn. I want more.

27:36.215 --> 27:38.562
I know what to do with
money when I have it.

27:38.667 --> 27:40.032
That's why I must have it.

27:40.136 --> 27:42.367
- Do you understand? I must have it.
- Yes, sir.

27:42.472 --> 27:45.037
Anything more this week
while the weather still holds?

27:45.141 --> 27:48.207
Perhaps tomorrow. I've been
thinking about your wife's niece.

27:48.311 --> 27:51.710
It seems a pity to bundle her off before
she's seen anything of the county.

27:51.814 --> 27:53.434
I've nothing against
her stopping.

27:53.538 --> 27:55.797
Provided, of course,
she's kept out of the way.

28:05.036 --> 28:07.059
Up to your rooms, both of you.

28:07.163 --> 28:10.265
Patience,
take her supper upstairs.

28:22.553 --> 28:24.993
Now, try and sleep, dear.
You must be tired.

28:25.098 --> 28:27.183
Good night.

28:37.777 --> 28:41.027
- Look at that.
- Ooh, how much?

28:44.117 --> 28:46.139
You was right, Joss. See that?

28:46.244 --> 28:49.346
Best part of fifteen
pound in gold.

28:51.457 --> 28:53.543
What did I tell you?

28:54.210 --> 28:58.652
You've got yourself in a
pretty mess, Mr Trehearne.

28:58.756 --> 29:00.779
What have you got to say?

29:00.883 --> 29:02.698
Get me a drink.

29:02.802 --> 29:04.616
Choking gives you a thirst.

29:04.721 --> 29:07.369
Thomas, I'm sure you'll
oblige the gentleman.

29:07.473 --> 29:10.789
Seems I'm a good guesser,
Mr Trehearne.

29:10.893 --> 29:12.708
How did you get it?

29:12.812 --> 29:14.418
Saved.

29:14.522 --> 29:18.297
You mean, you've been
selling stuff on the side.

29:18.401 --> 29:20.883
I'm ashamed of you,
Mr Trehearne.

29:20.987 --> 29:23.072
That's what I am.

29:23.114 --> 29:26.292
Taking the bread out of
the mouths of your pals.

29:26.396 --> 29:27.556
There's your leak.

29:27.660 --> 29:29.266
Not true.

29:29.370 --> 29:31.393
He's making fools
of the lot of you.

29:31.497 --> 29:33.520
Where do you think
the stuff goes?

29:33.624 --> 29:37.107
Who gets rid of it? Do you think
Joss is in this by himself?

29:37.211 --> 29:40.225
Well, go on, ask him.
Ask him who.

29:41.507 --> 29:43.530
That was a cosh. Clean out.

29:43.634 --> 29:45.720
The dirty thief.

29:45.845 --> 29:48.619
- He asked for it all right.
- He done us. We do him.

29:48.723 --> 29:51.205
What are we all waiting for?

30:02.862 --> 30:05.844
Try the other room. See if
you can find me a nice beam.

30:05.948 --> 30:08.597
About six foot
two off the floor.

30:08.701 --> 30:10.140
Go on.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.043
JOSS:

30:17.147 --> 30:19.066
Hold on. I'll see if the
women are out of the way.

30:19.170 --> 30:21.829
Don't want a lot of squawking.

30:25.009 --> 30:27.095
Hurry up.

30:35.603 --> 30:38.377
It's a new chap, Trehearne.
They found this gold on him.

30:38.481 --> 30:40.295
Know anything about him?

30:40.400 --> 30:42.422
He came from St Ives a
couple of months ago,

30:42.527 --> 30:43.465
recommended by a pal.

30:43.569 --> 30:46.969
- Can't just kick him out. That's obvious.
- He might talk.

30:47.073 --> 30:51.306
- The men want to string him up tonight.
- Really? That's a trifle formal, isn't it?

30:51.411 --> 30:53.433
Pistol. Oh, no. Too noisy.

30:53.538 --> 30:58.412
Of course, you wouldn't want
to alarm your wife's niece.

30:59.168 --> 31:01.191
I suppose it's as
good a way as any.

31:01.295 --> 31:03.318
No need for you to go.
Tell 'em.

31:03.423 --> 31:06.436
I haven't finished
talking to you.

31:09.387 --> 31:10.993
- Harry?
- Yes?

31:11.097 --> 31:12.703
Get on with it.

31:12.807 --> 31:16.086
- I'll be down in a minute.
- All right.

31:17.979 --> 31:20.726
Come on, Salvation.
Look sharp.

31:25.737 --> 31:27.759
Stand back, the rest of you.

31:27.864 --> 31:29.720
We don't want
any gawpers here.

31:29.824 --> 31:32.266
This is private, see.
If you want a public hanging,

31:32.370 --> 31:33.932
Syd,
you won't have to wait long.

31:34.037 --> 31:38.145
And you'll get a fine view of it from
the best position. Inside the rope.

31:42.045 --> 31:44.349
You're not old enough yet.

31:45.548 --> 31:47.154
What about Joss?

31:47.258 --> 31:49.072
He says to get it over.

31:49.177 --> 31:50.991
Is this the place, Harry?

31:51.095 --> 31:53.619
That's it.
Plenty of clearance.

31:53.723 --> 31:56.371
Anything worth doing, I say,
is worth doing proper.

32:01.731 --> 32:03.295
Come on.

32:03.399 --> 32:06.131
Let's make a quick job of it
before he comes round.

32:06.235 --> 32:08.050
I won't be a party to that,
Thomas.

32:08.154 --> 32:11.136
It's only being kind to him.
He won't know nothing about it.

32:11.240 --> 32:14.223
It's no kindness to send a man
into the next world unawares.

32:14.327 --> 32:16.266
It's heathen.
That's what it is, I say.

32:16.371 --> 32:20.062
Bring him round with a nip of spirits
and give him a fair chance to meditate.

32:20.166 --> 32:23.440
I don't like the thought of it somehow.
It's like doing it in cold blood.

32:23.544 --> 32:25.150
Come on. He's heavy.

32:25.254 --> 32:28.987
- What do you say, Harry?
- I say shut your misbegotten mouths.

32:29.092 --> 32:31.177
Both of you.

32:32.804 --> 32:34.409
Aha.

32:34.514 --> 32:37.079
At it again, Dandy?
Grab, grab, grab all the time.

32:37.183 --> 32:42.058
We'll spin a coin for them
buckles, when I say the word.

32:43.398 --> 32:45.483
Let's have a light.

33:07.463 --> 33:09.549
All together.

33:09.590 --> 33:11.676
Pull.

33:23.479 --> 33:26.295
- Don't you let him have them, Harry.
- Go on.

33:26.399 --> 33:28.130
- Throttle him, Dandy.
- Go on, Harry.

33:28.234 --> 33:33.020
Shut your mouth. Do you
want to bring Joss down?

34:14.864 --> 34:16.887
You've got to get out of here.

34:16.991 --> 34:19.473
They'll be back in a minute.

34:21.245 --> 34:23.060
Please, you must try.

34:23.164 --> 34:25.248
Quick, quick.

34:37.887 --> 34:41.161
- You mustn't stop here. Get away.
- I couldn't leave Aunt Patience.

34:41.264 --> 34:43.351
Please, you must hurry.

34:56.155 --> 34:58.241
Quick. Before Joss...

35:28.563 --> 35:30.294
There you are, my dear.

35:30.398 --> 35:33.500
Been saying good
night to Patience?

35:35.486 --> 35:38.302
Yes, I've been
thinking things over.

35:38.406 --> 35:41.847
'She's a sweet, pretty girl,' I said
to myself, 'with a lot of character.'

35:41.951 --> 35:44.541
It seems a pity
to send her away,

35:44.645 --> 35:48.437
before she's hardly seen
anything of the county.

35:48.541 --> 35:52.691
'She can stay here,' I said, 'just
as long as she feels inclined.'

35:52.795 --> 35:54.881
Joss. Joss.

35:54.922 --> 35:57.081
Come down, Joss.

36:09.103 --> 36:11.189
He's been took, Joss.

36:11.230 --> 36:14.379
- What? Who?
- Trehearne, he's been took by the angels.

36:14.484 --> 36:17.841
- Of course, he's been took. I know that.
- But alive, Joss. Alive.

36:17.945 --> 36:19.551
Mary.

36:19.655 --> 36:21.741
It was you.

36:21.783 --> 36:23.868
You set that man free.

36:24.035 --> 36:26.329
Listen to me. You must
leave Jamaica Inn now,

36:26.433 --> 36:27.684
this minute, do you hear?

36:27.789 --> 36:29.874
There y'are.

36:31.959 --> 36:34.884
That blasted girl,
I'll kill her.

36:36.172 --> 36:38.178
For pity's sake, go now.

36:38.378 --> 36:40.385
Before Joss comes up.

36:50.561 --> 36:52.647
Where's that girl?

36:52.688 --> 36:54.774
Where is she?

36:57.110 --> 36:59.195
You let her go.

37:08.705 --> 37:09.747
JOSS:

37:09.851 --> 37:11.270
Thomas, take this lamp.
Look in the stables.

37:11.374 --> 37:13.897
Harry, give me a hand.
We'll go through the yard.

37:14.001 --> 37:17.359
If some of you don't get a move
on, I'll break your blasted necks.

37:17.463 --> 37:21.363
They can't
have got away so soon.

37:24.178 --> 37:26.326
- We can't stay here. Come on.
- Where?

37:26.431 --> 37:28.453
Down by the harbour.
I know a place.

37:28.558 --> 37:31.394
We'll be safe
there for a while.

37:34.147 --> 37:36.232
Come on. Hurry.

37:37.692 --> 37:39.923
Joss. Shall I search the moor?

37:40.027 --> 37:42.150
Try the yard.

37:47.493 --> 37:51.659
We'll have to get 'em,
if we stay out all night.

37:51.664 --> 37:53.687
There's not a sign
of either of them.

37:53.791 --> 37:55.814
- They've got clear. Any luck?
- No.

37:55.918 --> 37:58.358
If we don't find 'em, we'll
swing for it, like as not.

37:58.463 --> 38:00.485
Harry, take a couple of
men down to the coast.

38:00.590 --> 38:03.161
Thomas, get your brother
and any of our chaps...

38:03.265 --> 38:04.907
...you can find.
Search the moors.

38:05.011 --> 38:10.595
- What are you going to do, Joss?
- I'll take the Bodmin turnpike.

38:10.683 --> 38:12.769
Chadwick.

38:13.853 --> 38:17.044
- It's very late, sir.
- She was a very charming girl, Chadwick.

38:17.148 --> 38:19.436
I didn't mention it before,
sir, but the butcher...

38:19.540 --> 38:21.048
...was here while
you were at dinner.

38:21.152 --> 38:25.093
- He wants his account settled.
- Remarkably unattractive occupation.

38:25.198 --> 38:27.930
Drearily dismembering
carcass after carcass.

38:28.034 --> 38:30.349
- I suppose they must live, sir.
- Must they?

38:30.453 --> 38:33.602
There's nearly £40 owing to
the butcher, £35 to the baker.

38:33.706 --> 38:35.520
You see, sir,
butcher, baker...

38:35.625 --> 38:37.606
Don't butcher and baker me.

38:37.710 --> 38:39.796
You old numbskull.

39:01.776 --> 39:04.049
I'm sorry, huh,
Chadwick, what?

39:05.353 --> 39:07.439
Doing your duty.

39:07.480 --> 39:09.962
That's all, Master Humphrey.

39:10.817 --> 39:14.550
These outbursts of mine
are quite inexcusable.

39:14.654 --> 39:17.579
I can't think what
comes over me.

39:17.824 --> 39:19.910
By the way, Chadwick,

39:19.951 --> 39:23.036
what happened to
my grandfather?

39:27.292 --> 39:29.508
Yes, went mad, didn't he?

39:38.386 --> 39:41.243
No need for you to hang about,
Chadwick.

39:41.348 --> 39:43.433
Go to bed.

40:00.200 --> 40:03.182
How dare you come here to me.
Haven't I told you a score of times?

40:03.286 --> 40:06.060
Yes, but Trehearne has got
away. That girl set him free.

40:06.164 --> 40:08.521
I couldn't help it.
It was while I was with you.

40:08.625 --> 40:11.357
- What have you done with her?
- She's gone, too.

40:11.461 --> 40:13.484
Oh, a general exodus,
apparently.

40:13.588 --> 40:15.736
You persuaded your
wife to remain, I hope.

40:15.840 --> 40:18.531
The men are out looking for
them now. We're doing our best.

40:18.635 --> 40:20.074
Is that all you
came here to say?

40:20.178 --> 40:21.893
That chap Trehearne
knows too much.

40:21.998 --> 40:24.370
If he was to inform against
me and the others...

40:24.474 --> 40:26.497
You're losing your head,
Merlyn.

40:26.601 --> 40:29.542
Even if Trehearne lives to do
any informing, he'll do it here.

40:29.646 --> 40:31.669
I'm the only justice
in the neighbourhood.

40:31.773 --> 40:34.880
If you can't keep your wits about
you, kindly allow me to keep mine.

40:34.985 --> 40:37.383
If I didn't,
you'd never see another wreck.

40:37.487 --> 40:40.219
When the brains are out,
the body dies, Merlyn.

40:40.323 --> 40:43.722
And I needn't remind you that
in this little organisation,

40:43.827 --> 40:46.183
you and your fellows
are only the carcass.

40:46.288 --> 40:49.645
- The brains are here, what?
- I'm sorry. I was only trying to warn you.

40:49.749 --> 40:51.355
Will you let me
do the warning?

40:51.459 --> 40:53.253
If you want any more fat
pickings on the shore,

40:53.357 --> 40:54.400
just obey orders.

40:54.504 --> 40:58.404
And don't come here again.
Get out. Get out.

42:06.326 --> 42:08.411
Hey. What?

42:08.453 --> 42:10.669
Come back. What on earth?

42:15.377 --> 42:17.817
- Now, what do you think you're doing?
- Let go.

42:17.921 --> 42:19.652
Don't be a fool.
You can't even row.

42:19.756 --> 42:21.237
Leave me alone.

42:21.341 --> 42:23.468
You're not afraid of me?

42:24.261 --> 42:27.201
You are. Well, that's women for
you. Save your life one minute...

42:27.305 --> 42:30.939
...and frightened for
their own the next.

42:31.518 --> 42:33.561
Yes, I'm not a very pretty
sight at the moment,

42:33.666 --> 42:34.708
but I don't bite.

42:34.813 --> 42:37.125
You think I don't know why
my aunt is frightened...

42:37.230 --> 42:39.171
...for her life,
that I don't know what you...

42:39.276 --> 42:41.027
...and the rest of you
are doing at Jamaica Inn?

42:41.132 --> 42:42.174
No. What?

42:42.279 --> 42:44.510
Thieves, smugglers,
cut-throats, for all I know,

42:44.614 --> 42:46.700
and I'm not staying.

43:02.841 --> 43:04.029
Look.

43:04.134 --> 43:05.614
Harry, here.

43:05.719 --> 43:07.742
A very significant
piece of flotsam, eh?

43:07.846 --> 43:10.416
It came out of the cave.

43:10.432 --> 43:13.706
Suppose you ask your brother to
take you for a nice row? Follow me?

43:13.810 --> 43:16.333
- Rather.
- Can I go, too, Harry? I saw it first.

43:16.438 --> 43:20.588
No, you cut back and tell
Joss everything's lovely. Run.

43:20.692 --> 43:23.528
Dandy,
you go and get some rope.

43:23.820 --> 43:25.906
This way.

43:41.212 --> 43:43.603
You know what you've done?
The tide's going...

43:43.708 --> 43:46.363
...out now, but it'll be high
water again before dark.

43:46.468 --> 43:48.574
We can't stay here
without that boat.

43:48.678 --> 43:51.869
We'll have to run for it as
soon as the tide's low enough.

43:51.973 --> 43:54.205
Trust me to land
myself with a woman.

43:54.309 --> 43:56.361
On the other hand,
you did save my life.

43:56.465 --> 43:59.043
I hope you'll make better
use of it in the future.

43:59.147 --> 44:01.107
A tall order for a
desperate character like me.

44:01.212 --> 44:02.254
No doubt.

44:02.359 --> 44:04.698
A smuggler and a cut-throat,
I think you said.

44:04.804 --> 44:06.675
Do you think there's
any hope for me?

44:06.780 --> 44:09.470
- Tell me, what ought I to do?
- Anything you please.

44:09.574 --> 44:11.680
I used to be a sailor.
I could go back to sea.

44:11.785 --> 44:14.183
- I'm not in the least interested.
- You must be.

44:14.287 --> 44:16.310
- You're responsible for me.
- I am not.

44:16.414 --> 44:19.897
But for you, I shouldn't be here
at all. You can't deny that.

44:20.001 --> 44:22.900
When we're safe in Truro, I
shall put myself in your hands.

44:23.004 --> 44:26.278
- Oh, please be quiet.
- Oh, cheer up. We'll be there by...

44:28.635 --> 44:30.616
Take the little book.

44:30.720 --> 44:33.619
There's a beautiful
hymn on page 13.

44:33.723 --> 44:36.622
'While at death's door
I trembling stand.'

44:36.726 --> 44:39.015
Very comforting.

44:39.187 --> 44:42.211
- Makes dying a pleasure, so he says.
- A handsome couple.

44:42.315 --> 44:44.630
Breaks my heart
to disturb 'em.

44:44.734 --> 44:46.549
Coming down.

44:46.653 --> 44:49.802
Will you send the lady up first
or do you fancy it yourself?

44:49.906 --> 44:52.221
Ladies first, I always say.

44:52.325 --> 44:54.348
- What can we do?
- They know we're stuck.

44:54.452 --> 44:56.475
They must have seen
the boat drift out.

44:56.580 --> 45:00.646
Just in case you'd like a
bit of help, Mr Trehearne,

45:00.750 --> 45:05.536
your old friend Thomas is
coming down to offer his arm.

45:13.513 --> 45:15.244
He's out.

45:15.348 --> 45:17.371
Any more?
We're fond of company.

45:17.475 --> 45:20.207
You'll get it all right.
Never you fear.

45:20.312 --> 45:22.376
It'll be a pleasure.
Come on. Who's it to be?

45:22.480 --> 45:26.213
Here, Belcher. Grab this. Slip
it round that bit of rock. Quick.

45:26.318 --> 45:30.176
Do you hear that? There's
only one way out of this.

45:30.280 --> 45:31.927
Can you swim?

45:32.032 --> 45:34.829
Just to please you,
Mr Trehearne, so you won't...

45:34.933 --> 45:37.266
...feel lonely,
we're all three coming down.

45:37.370 --> 45:40.130
Please don't trouble with me.
I'll be in the way.

45:40.235 --> 45:42.938
It'll be hard enough for
you getting away alone.

45:43.043 --> 45:45.483
I'll be all right.
Joss daren't harm me.

45:45.587 --> 45:47.193
- Can you swim?
- A little.

45:47.297 --> 45:49.779
- Take off that dress and your shoes.
- I can't do that.

45:49.883 --> 45:51.489
- Take it off.
- I can't.

45:51.593 --> 45:55.847
- All right, then. I will.
- No, you won't. I will.

46:00.936 --> 46:04.034
...I shall be glad
when this little job's over.

46:04.139 --> 46:05.461
We've been up all night.

46:05.565 --> 46:07.338
Yes,
it'll be nice to get to bed.

46:07.442 --> 46:12.009
What about the girl?
Do we hand her over to Joss?

46:12.113 --> 46:14.241
They're coming. Come on.

46:19.204 --> 46:21.597
Now, Mr Trehearne...

46:27.087 --> 46:29.110
That's the spirit.
You're doing fine.

46:29.214 --> 46:30.257
That's funny.

46:30.361 --> 46:32.113
First time I've ever
seen a woman swimming.

46:32.217 --> 46:34.302
All this... this salt.

46:37.055 --> 46:40.996
Look. They've sent a boat.
It's coming this way.

46:41.101 --> 46:46.419
Quick. Those rocks. Hold onto
my shoulder. Are you all right?

46:57.742 --> 47:00.474
- Hold on. The boat's coming.
- I can't.

47:00.579 --> 47:02.883
Here it is.

47:10.839 --> 47:12.987
- Keep it up. They're going.
- It's no good.

47:13.091 --> 47:15.395
- I'm going.
- Hang on to me.

47:18.888 --> 47:20.974
Dowland.

47:21.391 --> 47:23.122
Ah, good morning, Dowland.

47:23.226 --> 47:26.292
I haven't had a taste of that
sloe gin of yours this year.

47:26.396 --> 47:29.670
- I'm three pounds short, Squire Pengallan.
- I told you...

47:29.774 --> 47:34.633
Dowland, I want money just as you do.
I can't be Squire Pengallan on nothing.

47:34.738 --> 47:36.761
- Why are you short?
- That lad of mine.

47:36.865 --> 47:39.331
He went down with a bad
leg and it won't heal.

47:39.435 --> 47:40.806
Take him to Dr Mackintosh.

47:40.911 --> 47:44.351
Give the doctor my compliments. Ask him
to look at the leg. Pay £3 next time.

47:44.456 --> 47:46.896
- Thank you, Squire.
- Give him a receipt, Davis.

47:47.000 --> 47:49.231
- But I warned...
- The receipt, Davis.

47:49.336 --> 47:52.526
This man's forefathers
were farming Pengallan land...

47:52.631 --> 47:55.362
...when yours were
hedge tinkers. Next.

47:55.467 --> 47:59.825
- Where can we go? Which way?
- We'd best make for the turnpike.

47:59.930 --> 48:01.952
Wait.
What house is that over there?

48:02.057 --> 48:04.288
- The Squire's.
- You mean Sir Humphrey?

48:04.392 --> 48:08.042
I know him. I was there last night.
He'll be glad to help us. Come on.

48:08.146 --> 48:12.082
This is the fellow I
mentioned, Sir Humphrey.

48:12.187 --> 48:14.314
Burdkin. A rank radical.

48:17.030 --> 48:19.115
Burdkin.

48:22.869 --> 48:24.955
Er, well, Burdkin?

48:25.455 --> 48:29.000
I've come to complain.
I want my rights.

48:29.125 --> 48:31.649
Your rights? I don't listen
to that sort of talk.

48:31.753 --> 48:34.527
- I've the law on my side.
- You haven't.

48:34.631 --> 48:38.406
I'm the law here and on your side I
won't be while you take that tone.

48:38.510 --> 48:40.866
Next you'll be telling me
you're as good as I am.

48:40.971 --> 48:42.493
I'm a man, same as you.

48:42.597 --> 48:45.579
Put that out of your head before
it lands you in the hulks.

48:45.684 --> 48:47.886
You're not as good as
I am and never will be.

48:47.990 --> 48:49.792
Nature was against
it from the start.

48:49.896 --> 48:53.045
Everything else has been against
it since. I'm a gentleman.

48:53.149 --> 48:54.463
Why, you great...

48:54.568 --> 48:56.726
Have him run out, Davis.

48:58.488 --> 49:00.970
Er, don't give him 24 hours.

49:07.038 --> 49:09.874
If you please,
Squire Pengallan.

49:10.667 --> 49:12.898
Why if it isn't
Granny Tremarney.

49:13.003 --> 49:14.483
Yes, Your Honour.

49:14.588 --> 49:17.579
It's my roof. I've complained
to Mr Davis about it,

49:17.683 --> 49:20.614
but he takes no notice.
It leaks all the time now.

49:20.719 --> 49:23.909
- Give her a new roof, Davis.
- But, Sir Humphrey...

49:24.014 --> 49:26.099
I said a new roof.

49:26.725 --> 49:29.957
She's my oldest tenant, hm?
While I'm here, she'll be snug.

49:30.061 --> 49:32.293
I'm the only man under
the rank of marquis...

49:32.397 --> 49:34.628
...who ever gambled ten
years at White's Club...

49:34.733 --> 49:37.840
...and kept his estate out of
the hands of the moneylenders.

49:37.944 --> 49:39.967
While I have a roof,
she shall have one.

49:40.071 --> 49:42.803
- I must see Sir Humphrey...
- What's this?

49:42.908 --> 49:46.182
you're to let me in.
It's very important.

49:46.286 --> 49:48.642
My dear child,
what on earth's happened?

49:48.747 --> 49:50.311
You're... soaked to the skin.

49:50.415 --> 49:52.438
Chadwick, get Mrs Black
and close the door.

49:52.542 --> 49:54.628
Come to the fire.

49:56.463 --> 49:59.320
Tell them to go now, Davis.
Some other time.

49:59.424 --> 50:02.073
But you're positively
blue with cold.

50:02.177 --> 50:03.991
- Where have you been?
- Swimming.

50:04.095 --> 50:06.702
- For our lives.
- Er... Who, er... Who is this?

50:06.806 --> 50:10.414
This is Jem Trehearne. We got
away from Jamaica Inn last night.

50:10.518 --> 50:13.177
It's a horrible place.
It's nothing better than...

50:13.282 --> 50:15.669
...a den of smugglers.
They'd have murdered him.

50:15.774 --> 50:19.548
- She saved my life, sir.
- Well, this is extraordinary.

50:19.653 --> 50:22.968
We need your help. My aunt's
still there. If you only knew...

50:23.073 --> 50:24.723
You must tell me
the whole story,

50:24.828 --> 50:27.098
but, first, we must find
you some dry things.

50:27.202 --> 50:29.395
Oh, Mrs Black, take this
young lady upstairs...

50:29.499 --> 50:31.644
...and see if you can find
her something to wear.

50:31.748 --> 50:33.771
Will you come this way, miss?

50:33.875 --> 50:38.661
- Could I speak to you for a moment, please?
- Of course.

50:40.090 --> 50:42.175
Really?

50:46.179 --> 50:49.245
Well, er... We, er... We
must see what we can do, hm?

50:49.349 --> 50:52.983
- Thank you. You're very kind.
- Not at all.

51:07.492 --> 51:09.306
Oh, er, excuse me, sir.

51:09.411 --> 51:10.891
Chadwick.

51:10.996 --> 51:14.937
Get the erm... fellow some
er... bread and beer.

51:15.041 --> 51:17.257
I'll deal with you later.

51:19.462 --> 51:23.571
So, I let her have it with nine
eight-pounders, then we went alongside...

51:23.675 --> 51:26.157
'Wherein I spake of most
disastrous chances,

51:26.261 --> 51:29.910
of moving accidents by flood and
field of hairbreadth 'scapes...'

51:30.015 --> 51:33.622
- Captain Murray, you'll stay to dinner?
- You keep the best table in Cornwall.

51:33.727 --> 51:36.792
- I should hope so. Why go?
- I'm due to rejoin my ship at Falmouth.

51:36.896 --> 51:38.675
By the time you've
finished your port...

51:38.780 --> 51:40.880
...and walnuts, I shall be
sailing past the house.

51:40.984 --> 51:43.731
The deuce you will.

51:43.904 --> 51:46.385
I must have a word with you.

51:47.365 --> 51:49.451
- Well?
- Er, in private.

51:49.492 --> 51:53.267
There's nothing you can tell me
these gentlemen shouldn't know.

51:53.371 --> 51:55.811
One of a gang of smugglers
from Jamaica Inn.

51:55.916 --> 51:58.939
Smugglers, eh? Have you got
any good brandies through?

51:59.044 --> 52:01.066
Well, yes,
as a matter of fact,

52:01.171 --> 52:02.689
I've got a list of them here.

52:02.793 --> 52:05.071
Kindly remember I'm a
justice of the peace.

52:05.175 --> 52:09.533
Nevertheless, I think you'll
be rather interested...

52:09.639 --> 52:11.724
...in these brandies.

52:27.489 --> 52:29.574
Erm...

52:33.620 --> 52:34.663
Er, gentlemen,

52:34.767 --> 52:37.436
I think I must look into
this matter in private.

52:37.540 --> 52:39.355
What?

52:39.459 --> 52:41.675
Come along, my dear chap.

52:42.712 --> 52:46.821
Pengallan, if you don't find something good
for me, I'll report you to the Commission.

52:46.925 --> 52:49.229
After you, my dear fellow.

52:49.844 --> 52:52.347
I've placed some bread and
beer for this person...

52:52.451 --> 52:53.494
...in the harness room.

52:53.598 --> 52:57.998
Have you now? Place some cold chicken and
claret 'for this person' in the study.

52:58.103 --> 53:00.126
Find some clothes
for Mr Trehearne.

53:00.230 --> 53:04.422
Mine would be a trifle generous. One of
Lord George's would be nearer the mark.

53:04.526 --> 53:07.299
- For this gentleman?
- Yes. Will you hurry? Hurry.

53:07.404 --> 53:09.510
- Master Humphrey...
- I must apologise.

53:09.614 --> 53:11.932
I hadn't the least idea who
you were. Now, a stiff...

53:12.036 --> 53:14.265
...glass of brandy till you're
fed and in dry clothes.

53:14.369 --> 53:16.100
I'm most awfully
obliged to you.

53:16.204 --> 53:17.810
Not at all. Come in.

53:17.914 --> 53:21.272
I hold the rank of Lieutenant
in His Majesty's Royal Navy.

53:21.376 --> 53:23.899
I was seconded for duty
from the Home Office.

53:24.004 --> 53:26.652
I've been at some pains
to conceal my identity.

53:26.756 --> 53:29.399
I still haven't the least
notion what it's all about,

53:29.504 --> 53:31.282
but swallow this
before you tell me.

53:31.386 --> 53:34.128
I always had a great
admiration for the service.

53:34.233 --> 53:35.578
I knew Collingwood well.

53:35.682 --> 53:40.082
All fine fellows. A trifle desiccated,
perhaps. One can't have everything.

53:40.186 --> 53:42.209
Now,
what is all this business?

53:42.314 --> 53:44.399
Smuggling?

53:45.233 --> 53:47.798
No, it's much worse than that,
sir. Wrecking.

53:47.903 --> 53:50.426
Deliberate,
organised wrecking.

53:50.530 --> 53:53.387
- Not here, though?
- Yes, sir. Along this coast.

53:53.491 --> 53:56.849
Always had wrecks here, you
know. A very dangerous coast.

53:56.953 --> 54:01.145
Lloyds discovered that these wrecks
had one curious feature in common.

54:01.249 --> 54:02.980
Indeed? Drink that up.

54:03.084 --> 54:05.316
I think I'll join
you with the brandy.

54:05.420 --> 54:08.194
It has been er...
quite an eventful morning.

54:08.298 --> 54:10.946
What had these
wrecks in common?

54:11.051 --> 54:13.798
There were never
any survivors.

54:23.772 --> 54:25.503
Er, Mr Trehearne,

54:25.607 --> 54:27.505
if what you tell me is true,

54:27.609 --> 54:30.174
it's the most dreadful
thing I've ever heard.

54:30.278 --> 54:34.178
- We hear of wrecks down here...
- Lloyds consulted with the Home Office.

54:34.282 --> 54:37.348
They became convinced these
wreckers had accurate information...

54:37.452 --> 54:42.394
...of the movements
and cargoes of ships...

54:42.499 --> 54:45.356
Captain Murray wishes to
say goodbye to you, sir.

54:45.460 --> 54:48.296
- Would you excuse me?
- Certainly.

54:50.799 --> 54:54.365
I'm just going. I enjoyed myself
immensely. You're a prince.

54:54.469 --> 54:57.743
- Goodbye, Captain. Bon voyage.
- I'm coming back again.

54:57.847 --> 55:02.251
I shall be thinking of you
out there in this wind...

55:02.355 --> 55:05.989
...when I'm sitting
over my port tonight.

55:11.820 --> 55:13.905
- All right?
- Jolly good.

55:13.947 --> 55:15.678
Well, er, Mr Trehearne,

55:15.782 --> 55:17.388
kindly continue.

55:17.492 --> 55:21.058
My researches took me to Jamaica
Inn. The landlord is the ringleader.

55:21.162 --> 55:23.561
That wreck last night was
carried out by his men.

55:23.665 --> 55:27.606
- You were actually there?
- No, thank heaven, I was still on probation.

55:27.711 --> 55:31.522
But I helped carry the
goods up afterwards.

55:31.756 --> 55:33.842
Have you erm...

55:34.467 --> 55:37.032
Have you reported all
this to your superiors?

55:37.137 --> 55:39.222
No, not yet.

55:45.895 --> 55:49.263
I'm after bigger fry
than Joss Merlyn.

55:49.816 --> 55:53.466
I don't follow you. Erm... You
er... said he was the ringleader.

55:53.570 --> 55:57.136
At Jamaica Inn, yes, but he
gets his orders from outside.

55:57.240 --> 55:59.472
His information
comes from outside.

55:59.576 --> 56:01.432
His thinking's done
for him outside.

56:01.536 --> 56:03.267
- By whom?
- I don't know.

56:03.371 --> 56:07.522
Merlyn's own wife doesn't
know. The gang don't...

56:07.627 --> 56:11.792
...even know. That's the
man we've got to find.

56:21.640 --> 56:25.206
Yes, Joss has called the men for
tonight. There's to be another wreck.

56:25.310 --> 56:28.834
They won't know where until they
get information from their leader.

56:28.939 --> 56:33.631
In order to give them that information,
he'll be going to the inn tonight.

56:33.735 --> 56:36.801
- We must get there first.
- We can't do that single-handed.

56:36.905 --> 56:39.095
I'll ride for help to
the nearest garrison.

56:39.199 --> 56:41.809
But that'll take time.
We mustn't let this fellow...

56:41.913 --> 56:43.140
...slip through our fingers.

56:43.245 --> 56:45.580
You and I will go to the inn.
My groom can take...

56:45.684 --> 56:47.686
...a message to the
garrison at Truro for you.

56:47.791 --> 56:48.833
Take some of those.

56:48.938 --> 56:51.649
You say Merlyn's riffraff
won't be there till later?

56:51.753 --> 56:54.568
I fancy we two can hold the
fort till the military come.

56:54.673 --> 56:58.280
- I'm game, if you are, sir.
- Excellent. This is positively exciting.

56:58.385 --> 56:59.990
Come in.

57:00.095 --> 57:04.662
- Chadwick, your money or your life?
- The clothes, sir. I've not told Lord George.

57:04.766 --> 57:06.789
Who's the commander at Truro?

57:06.893 --> 57:08.979
Er...

57:09.479 --> 57:13.295
Captain... Boyle, an Irishman, I
believe. Good fellow in a pinch.

57:13.400 --> 57:14.588
I'll write him a note.

57:14.693 --> 57:19.390
No, I'll do that. You get
into Lord George's breeches.

57:24.244 --> 57:26.329
To, er...

57:26.371 --> 57:28.992
Captain... Boyle... erm...

57:29.124 --> 57:31.496
...officer commanding...

57:32.669 --> 57:34.827
...county militia,

57:35.005 --> 57:37.090
Truro.

57:38.883 --> 57:41.115
What shall I erm...
say to him?

57:41.219 --> 57:43.451
You know this style of thing.

57:43.555 --> 57:46.125
Your help is needed urgently.

57:49.686 --> 57:51.771
Your er... help?

57:51.813 --> 57:53.898
Help, yes. Help.

57:53.940 --> 57:56.562
Is... needed... urgently.

58:06.786 --> 58:09.977
...which...

58:11.166 --> 58:16.572
For which...? For which,
er...? For which, er...

58:16.922 --> 58:20.467
to give your
immediate attention...

58:24.804 --> 58:28.162
I have with me an officer of
the law, James Trehearne...

58:28.266 --> 58:32.609
Officer of the law,
James Trehearne.

58:36.483 --> 58:40.091
Got that?
All right, Sir Humphrey? Yes.

58:40.195 --> 58:46.931
He reports that the wreckers have their
headquarters at Jamaica Inn, Pengallan.

58:47.035 --> 58:49.526
And has enough evidence...

58:49.704 --> 58:53.604
...to hang the landlord
and his accomplices.

58:57.963 --> 58:59.693
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

58:59.798 --> 59:04.115
A miraculous fit. You put Lord
George in the shade, what?

59:04.219 --> 59:05.950
I'd better get you a hat.

59:06.054 --> 59:07.368
Chadwick.

59:07.472 --> 59:11.330
- We must leave at once, you know.
- One moment, sir.

59:11.434 --> 59:14.375
The girl, Miss Yellan,
she mustn't know about this.

59:14.479 --> 59:16.383
Oh, no, no, no.
That must wait.

59:16.487 --> 59:19.338
Poor thing. Evidently
devoted to her relative.

59:19.442 --> 59:22.800
I had no choice, Sir Humphrey.
I couldn't tell her the truth.

59:22.904 --> 59:25.136
Tell Sam I want him at once.
Where is he?

59:25.240 --> 59:26.971
- In the kitchen, sir.
- Sam.

59:27.075 --> 59:29.098
You'd better have
a warm cloak.

59:29.202 --> 59:32.810
Get Mr Trehearne the blue cloak, not
the one with the astrakhan collar,

59:32.914 --> 59:35.563
get him a hat,
and get me my cloak and hat.

59:35.667 --> 59:38.065
- Oh, Sam.
- Ride into Truro as fast as you can.

59:38.169 --> 59:41.152
Deliver that to Captain Boyle
at Militia Headquarters.

59:41.256 --> 59:44.029
Gallop all the way.
Very good, sir.

59:44.134 --> 59:49.577
Would you be good enough to tell Robbins
I want my coach at once? Come along.

59:49.681 --> 59:51.766
Chadwick.

59:52.017 --> 59:53.831
- Your coat, sir.
- Oh, thank you.

59:53.935 --> 59:56.792
Would you tell Mrs Black to
look after the young lady...

59:56.896 --> 01:00:00.629
...and if she can persuade her to get
a little sleep, so much the better?

01:00:00.734 --> 01:00:02.965
Will you make my
excuses for me?

01:00:03.069 --> 01:00:05.551
Tell Lord George I'll
be back for dinner.

01:00:05.655 --> 01:00:08.580
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, thank you so much.

01:00:12.871 --> 01:00:14.956
Robbins.

01:00:18.793 --> 01:00:20.524
Where is my coach?

01:00:20.629 --> 01:00:22.234
Isn't it ready?

01:00:22.339 --> 01:00:25.112
The young lady came round
the back and took it, sir.

01:00:25.216 --> 01:00:27.865
- What?
- She said you had ordered it for her, sir.

01:00:27.969 --> 01:00:31.426
- Do you think?
- Horses. Quick, will you?

01:00:33.183 --> 01:00:35.609
You must come away with
me while there's time.

01:00:35.713 --> 01:00:37.708
That man I cut down
was a law officer.

01:00:37.812 --> 01:00:40.147
He's on his way here
now with Sir Humphrey.

01:00:40.252 --> 01:00:41.921
They've sent to
Truro for help.

01:00:42.025 --> 01:00:45.216
I must change. Get your things
together before they come.

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:46.801
I must tell Joss.

01:00:46.905 --> 01:00:48.803
- No time.
- I'll not leave without Joss.

01:00:48.907 --> 01:00:51.555
They know the truth and,
Aunt Patience, so do I.

01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:54.141
This is your last chance
to be free of him.

01:00:54.246 --> 01:00:55.434
No.

01:00:55.538 --> 01:00:57.353
He's a wrecker, a murderer.

01:00:57.457 --> 01:01:01.482
But he's my husband. Oh, Mary, you
don't understand. You don't know him.

01:01:15.517 --> 01:01:19.505
She's come here to warn us.
We must get away.

01:01:21.648 --> 01:01:24.463
Where's that fellow?
Where's Trehearne?

01:01:24.568 --> 01:01:28.300
Joss, they're coming for you.
Trehearne's a law officer. We can't...

01:02:03.773 --> 01:02:05.504
Keep quiet.

01:02:05.609 --> 01:02:11.635
I don't think I need tell you why
I'm here with this officer, Merlyn.

01:02:11.948 --> 01:02:15.639
I fancy you'll be able to guess. I
demand the right to search your premises.

01:02:15.744 --> 01:02:19.200
Perhaps you'd show us round,
Mr Merlyn?

01:02:22.334 --> 01:02:24.356
All clear in there,
Sir Humphrey.

01:02:24.461 --> 01:02:27.109
So, you're here. How quick
of you, Mr Trehearne,

01:02:27.213 --> 01:02:29.153
but law officers waste
very little time.

01:02:29.257 --> 01:02:31.572
I'm sorry.
Come here, Mrs Merlyn.

01:02:31.676 --> 01:02:34.033
- She had nothing to do with this.
- I hope not.

01:02:34.137 --> 01:02:36.494
Why didn't you tell
me who you were?

01:02:36.598 --> 01:02:38.537
So you could have
warned your aunt?

01:02:38.642 --> 01:02:41.173
And why not? She's innocent.
She won't run...

01:02:41.278 --> 01:02:43.751
...away. Nothing will
drive her away from Joss.

01:02:43.855 --> 01:02:48.380
If that is the case, perhaps Mrs Merlyn
will mix us something to drive out the cold.

01:02:48.485 --> 01:02:51.425
What would you like? A hot
brandy, if you'd be so kind.

01:02:51.529 --> 01:02:55.695
- Up the stairs, Joss. Go on. Get up.
- Joss?

01:02:55.909 --> 01:02:58.140
I'm sorry about this,
believe me.

01:02:58.245 --> 01:03:01.790
But try not to worry.
We'll do our best.

01:03:04.167 --> 01:03:06.982
Aunt Patience, you've
known about Joss all along.

01:03:07.087 --> 01:03:10.945
I love him. People can't help being
what they are. Joss can't. I can't.

01:03:11.049 --> 01:03:14.323
- There's nothing to be done.
- Even now you could leave him.

01:03:14.427 --> 01:03:17.451
Go and put the kettle on the
fire while I get the brandy.

01:03:17.555 --> 01:03:19.954
This is where he comes in,
up these stone steps.

01:03:20.058 --> 01:03:22.164
You're expecting a visitor,
aren't you?

01:03:22.269 --> 01:03:25.876
He comes to one of these rooms. I've
tried that door, but it's locked.

01:03:25.981 --> 01:03:27.586
Give me the key.

01:03:27.691 --> 01:03:33.186
- I'll break that door down.
- Don't be a fool. Give him the key.

01:03:37.951 --> 01:03:40.036
Go on. Get in.

01:03:40.829 --> 01:03:42.852
Mind your head, Sir Humphrey.

01:03:42.956 --> 01:03:44.770
These doors are rather low.

01:03:44.874 --> 01:03:46.480
Oh, er, thank you.

01:03:46.585 --> 01:03:48.732
- This looks more like it.
- Never used.

01:03:48.837 --> 01:03:51.110
- What did you say, Merlyn?
- I say it's never used.

01:03:51.214 --> 01:03:53.946
- No? Then why is that fire alight?
- You're right.

01:03:54.050 --> 01:03:57.283
Our friend's apparently
expected very soon.

01:03:57.387 --> 01:04:01.996
Deuced considerate of the
fellow. I like a good fire.

01:04:02.225 --> 01:04:04.311
Here's something.

01:04:07.439 --> 01:04:09.962
- What do you make of it?
- It's blood on silk.

01:04:10.066 --> 01:04:13.799
We got silk from last night's wreck.
You see? He was here last night.

01:04:13.904 --> 01:04:20.374
- Foolish of you to overlook this, Joss.
- One might even say careless.

01:04:21.244 --> 01:04:24.310
See that, Sir Humphrey?
There's been many others, too.

01:04:24.414 --> 01:04:26.437
An unusual place.
Behind the curtain.

01:04:26.541 --> 01:04:28.147
- A signal?
- You've hit it.

01:04:28.251 --> 01:04:32.860
- Open the door at the end of the passage.
- Certainly.

01:04:35.091 --> 01:04:37.396
- Thank you.
- Oh. Thank you.

01:04:52.734 --> 01:04:56.133
- Joss, who is it who comes here?
- Would you like to know?

01:04:56.238 --> 01:04:59.512
I'll tell you. Santa Claus.
Every Christmas.

01:04:59.616 --> 01:05:03.265
Things'll be a lot easier, if you
tell me. You don't plan these wrecks.

01:05:03.370 --> 01:05:07.181
- Who does?
- You'll find out, Mr Law Officer.

01:05:14.464 --> 01:05:16.487
The wall's covered in plaster.

01:05:16.591 --> 01:05:18.614
- I left the door open for him.
- Good.

01:05:18.718 --> 01:05:21.409
What about the signal?
Better light it up for him.

01:05:21.513 --> 01:05:23.598
I'll do that.

01:05:26.309 --> 01:05:28.749
What about the women?
Better bring them up.

01:05:28.853 --> 01:05:30.939
Right. I'll get them.

01:05:32.023 --> 01:05:34.797
- Watch him.
- Fetch my toddy while you're about it.

01:05:34.901 --> 01:05:36.090
Right.

01:05:36.194 --> 01:05:38.676
Still blowing?

01:05:39.781 --> 01:05:42.513
- Hard as ever, sir.
- Take your orders, Merlyn.

01:05:42.617 --> 01:05:44.703
Another wreck? Tonight?

01:05:44.744 --> 01:05:47.518
Captain Murray would like
to have dined with me.

01:05:47.622 --> 01:05:50.146
He dislikes the food on
shipboard, you know?

01:05:50.250 --> 01:05:54.483
He was particularly mortified at having
to sail past here at dinner time,

01:05:54.588 --> 01:05:57.361
which means, let's see,
er, Barnard's Head...

01:05:57.465 --> 01:05:59.613
- Nine o'clock or thereabouts.
- Yes, sir.

01:05:59.718 --> 01:06:02.992
- What are they carrying, sir?
- Among other things, gold.

01:06:03.096 --> 01:06:08.680
You must make quite certain. I
need the money very particularly.

01:06:10.895 --> 01:06:12.918
I hope the wind drops after.

01:06:13.023 --> 01:06:15.254
- I'm an indifferent sailor.
- What?

01:06:15.358 --> 01:06:18.382
I'm going to take a little holiday.
I advise you to do the same.

01:06:18.486 --> 01:06:22.120
- Why? What's happened? Is...
- Nothing yet.

01:06:22.699 --> 01:06:26.098
But the authorities sent Mr
Trehearne down into Cornwall.

01:06:26.202 --> 01:06:28.288
You see, they suspect.

01:06:30.332 --> 01:06:32.855
I shall come back
when it's blown over.

01:06:32.959 --> 01:06:35.045
Then it's the last one?

01:06:35.086 --> 01:06:37.109
It's the last of this series.

01:06:37.213 --> 01:06:40.696
I shall catch the Falmouth
packet tonight for St-Malo.

01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:42.380
I shall call back on the way,

01:06:42.484 --> 01:06:44.909
so have the gold and
valuables ready for me.

01:06:45.013 --> 01:06:48.287
They're extremely fond of
such things in France.

01:06:48.391 --> 01:06:50.477
What about Trehearne?

01:06:50.518 --> 01:06:52.911
When will your men be here?

01:06:58.485 --> 01:07:01.675
If this is what saving your life
has brought us all to, I wish...

01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:04.793
You don't think
I'm enjoying this?

01:07:30.392 --> 01:07:32.915
Is anything wrong?
Oh, no.

01:07:33.019 --> 01:07:35.042
Our friend made a
very elementary joke.

01:07:35.146 --> 01:07:37.545
We're ready. I've locked
the women in the bedroom.

01:07:37.649 --> 01:07:40.381
Everything, in fact,
except the man himself.

01:07:40.485 --> 01:07:43.843
Your groom left just before us. An
hour and a quarter there and back.

01:07:43.947 --> 01:07:46.887
Which means Captain Boyle should
be here within ten minutes.

01:07:46.992 --> 01:07:49.190
There's only one way you
might save your skin.

01:07:49.294 --> 01:07:51.100
Name the man and
tell the whole story.

01:07:51.204 --> 01:07:53.622
I took the precaution of
bringing this warrant...

01:07:53.727 --> 01:07:55.187
...for the fellow's
apprehension.

01:07:55.292 --> 01:07:59.567
His name will have to be filled
in later when we know it.

01:07:59.671 --> 01:08:02.596
Like to write it in for us,
Joss?

01:08:03.425 --> 01:08:07.533
You've taken all the risks so far, you
and Harry and Salvation and the rest.

01:08:07.637 --> 01:08:10.411
And what have you got out
of it? The bare pickings.

01:08:10.515 --> 01:08:12.731
Have you thought of that?

01:08:13.059 --> 01:08:15.125
You've a chance to break
free of him for good.

01:08:15.229 --> 01:08:16.834
Turn king's evidence.
Why don't you?

01:08:16.938 --> 01:08:19.002
Do you think he'd hesitate
in your shoes? No.

01:08:19.107 --> 01:08:21.067
A man like that would
save his own skin first.

01:08:21.171 --> 01:08:22.214
You think so?

01:08:22.319 --> 01:08:23.473
He'd sacrifice anybody.

01:08:23.577 --> 01:08:25.885
You seem to have a very
clear picture of him.

01:08:25.988 --> 01:08:28.636
What sort of a fellow do
you think he really is?

01:08:28.742 --> 01:08:33.184
This man deliberately plans the wrecking
of ships and the cold-blooded slaughter...

01:08:33.287 --> 01:08:35.060
...of any who
survive the wreck.

01:08:35.165 --> 01:08:36.645
He remains aloof,

01:08:36.750 --> 01:08:39.814
content to hire the scum to
do his murderous work for him,

01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:44.194
thinking there's no blood on his own
hands, but there is, blood on his soul...

01:08:44.299 --> 01:08:48.032
The military.

01:08:48.136 --> 01:08:52.553
Watch him. I'll go down and
tell them to surround...

01:08:52.657 --> 01:08:57.089
...the place and to lie
low till we give the word.

01:08:59.229 --> 01:09:01.889
Oh, what a beauty.

01:09:04.152 --> 01:09:06.238
Stay where you are.

01:09:08.156 --> 01:09:10.242
You devil.

01:09:10.867 --> 01:09:12.180
Sir Humphrey.

01:09:12.285 --> 01:09:15.810
- Look out. Some of the gang are here.
- He's got somebody with him.

01:09:15.913 --> 01:09:19.370
- See nobody gets outside.
- Sir Humphrey.

01:09:21.002 --> 01:09:25.522
There's no other way.
Are you up there, Joss?

01:09:27.259 --> 01:09:29.344
Joss?

01:09:35.684 --> 01:09:37.769
Squire Pengallan?

01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:41.468
That's right. Your respected
justice of the peace...

01:09:41.572 --> 01:09:43.712
...brought here by
your pal Mr Trehearne.

01:09:43.817 --> 01:09:48.050
- Who forgot to tell you he's a law officer.
- What's that?

01:09:48.154 --> 01:09:53.055
What do you think? They came
here to hang us over the wreck.

01:09:53.158 --> 01:09:57.325
We'll make a real job of
it this time. Come on.

01:10:03.461 --> 01:10:05.547
Hold on.

01:10:06.047 --> 01:10:08.487
- We've got to go careful.
- What's the matter?

01:10:08.592 --> 01:10:12.700
We don't want our justice of the peace
found here dead. People might talk.

01:10:12.804 --> 01:10:15.202
- He won't be found.
- But he might be missed.

01:10:15.307 --> 01:10:17.329
Maybe they knew he
was coming here.

01:10:17.434 --> 01:10:19.248
- We've got to finish him.
- Surely,

01:10:19.352 --> 01:10:25.556
but that takes a little thinking over
and there's no time for that now.

01:10:26.192 --> 01:10:28.215
We're doing another wreck.

01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:30.134
- Tonight?
- Nine o'clock.

01:10:30.238 --> 01:10:32.470
We'll fix them
when we come back.

01:10:32.574 --> 01:10:34.388
Get a couple of ropes there.

01:10:34.492 --> 01:10:36.578
Chairs.

01:10:39.915 --> 01:10:43.194
No, I'll do him.
It'll be a pleasure.

01:10:47.547 --> 01:10:51.489
Do you think I came here just for you? I
told you, there's somebody behind Joss.

01:10:51.593 --> 01:10:53.834
If you wait here long enough,
you'll see him.

01:10:53.938 --> 01:10:55.159
He's coming here tonight.

01:10:55.263 --> 01:10:57.953
You shut your gab.
Playing for time, are you?

01:10:58.058 --> 01:11:00.729
You'd like to see us miss
that wreck we're doing...

01:11:00.833 --> 01:11:02.917
...tonight. We wouldn't
miss it for worlds.

01:11:03.021 --> 01:11:04.835
Joss,
finished trussing His Worship?

01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:07.171
Let's make 'em nice and snug.

01:11:07.275 --> 01:11:11.759
And while we're away, we've got to
think of a nice little accident for you.

01:11:11.863 --> 01:11:13.886
Now,
what would Your Worship fancy?

01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:16.013
A choice coach
over the cliffs?

01:11:16.117 --> 01:11:18.454
Or perhaps you'd sooner
be caught by the tide...

01:11:18.558 --> 01:11:19.850
...with our friend Jem here...

01:11:19.955 --> 01:11:22.603
...on a nice, comfortable,
cosy part of the beach.

01:11:22.707 --> 01:11:25.397
That's it. In death they
shall not be divided.

01:11:25.502 --> 01:11:29.193
I warn you, all of you, if you lay a
finger on either of us, you'll pay for it.

01:11:29.297 --> 01:11:30.949
You'll end swinging
in the wind at

01:11:31.053 --> 01:11:33.406
Execution Dock with tar
to keep the weather out.

01:11:33.510 --> 01:11:36.784
- It's time we went.
- Well, who's going to stay with them?

01:11:36.888 --> 01:11:41.330
What about Salvation? He can talk
to Mr Trehearne about eternity.

01:11:41.434 --> 01:11:43.290
Him? Not me.

01:11:43.395 --> 01:11:45.781
We'll need all hands on shore.
Patience'll watch...

01:11:45.886 --> 01:11:47.795
'em. The women are
locked in the bedroom.

01:11:47.899 --> 01:11:50.256
I'm sorry to see you here,
Willie Penhale.

01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:52.443
I told you when you
were up before me...

01:11:52.548 --> 01:11:54.844
...for poaching you were
among evil companions.

01:11:54.948 --> 01:11:58.404
You should have
listened to me, my boy.

01:11:59.119 --> 01:12:02.970
It looks as though your
wish is going to come...

01:12:03.075 --> 01:12:06.439
...true. You might just
as well have left me.

01:12:06.543 --> 01:12:08.983
- What's she doing here?
- She came here to warn us.

01:12:09.087 --> 01:12:11.624
She started the whole thing.
I don't see why...

01:12:11.728 --> 01:12:12.778
I'll look after her.

01:12:12.882 --> 01:12:16.907
I've got a nice job for you, Patience.
Take this and watch the two gentlemen.

01:12:17.012 --> 01:12:19.214
You can't leave
a woman in charge.

01:12:19.318 --> 01:12:21.245
I'll need you lot
down at the beach.

01:12:21.349 --> 01:12:23.770
They're tied. This is all
the better for a finger...

01:12:23.876 --> 01:12:25.583
...that's nervous,
like, on the trigger.

01:12:25.687 --> 01:12:27.999
I shouldn't move,
bearing that in mind. You...

01:12:28.103 --> 01:12:30.671
...wouldn't like your suit
spoiled with a bullet hole.

01:12:30.775 --> 01:12:33.299
You'll have no call to use it,
most likely.

01:12:33.403 --> 01:12:34.884
Come on. Look lively now.

01:12:34.988 --> 01:12:38.137
- Patience, you can't leave them like...
- You're coming with us.

01:12:38.241 --> 01:12:41.223
Take your hands off her. You
can't take her to the wreck.

01:12:41.328 --> 01:12:44.082
Of course not. I'm going
to leave her behind...

01:12:44.188 --> 01:12:47.062
...to cut you loose for the
second time in 24 hours.

01:12:47.167 --> 01:12:48.773
Come on now.

01:12:48.877 --> 01:12:50.149
Merlyn.

01:12:50.253 --> 01:12:52.068
You'll answer to
me for her safety.

01:12:52.172 --> 01:12:54.257
Yes, Your Worship.

01:13:04.142 --> 01:13:07.416
- What's happened to the military?
- Something must have delayed them.

01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:11.170
- If they'd come, we could save the wreck.
- We don't know where it's going to be.

01:13:11.274 --> 01:13:14.840
- Our man came here, but he left before us.
- How do you mean?

01:13:14.945 --> 01:13:16.967
Or Joss wouldn't have
known about the wreck.

01:13:17.072 --> 01:13:21.430
I warn you, Mrs Merlyn, if Captain Boyle
finds you like that, nothing will save you.

01:13:21.534 --> 01:13:24.809
This is very annoying. I told
Chadwick I'd be back for dinner.

01:13:24.913 --> 01:13:26.227
Mrs Merlyn,

01:13:26.331 --> 01:13:28.145
I wonder if that
pistol is loaded.

01:13:28.250 --> 01:13:31.690
You're inexperienced in these
things. Would you like me to look?

01:13:31.795 --> 01:13:34.402
- That'll never work.
- Very well, Mrs Merlyn.

01:13:34.506 --> 01:13:38.364
Let's see if it's properly primed. You're
not fully conversant with the facts.

01:13:38.468 --> 01:13:41.925
I know your husband
better than you do.

01:13:41.930 --> 01:13:45.538
He would no more have loaded that pistol
than he would have left me helpless,

01:13:45.642 --> 01:13:48.744
which would have
been quite absurd.

01:13:48.812 --> 01:13:50.897
As I thought.

01:13:51.398 --> 01:13:53.483
Now, Mrs Merlyn.

01:13:55.235 --> 01:13:59.218
I've always admired
your devotion to your husband.

01:13:59.322 --> 01:14:03.055
The woman shall cleave to the man,
even if the man is our friend Joss.

01:14:03.159 --> 01:14:07.414
Admirable. Now, if this
officer should escape...

01:14:07.455 --> 01:14:09.979
...your husband will pay
for it with his life,

01:14:10.083 --> 01:14:13.649
so I needn't stress the importance
of the task I'm giving you.

01:14:13.753 --> 01:14:15.839
There.

01:14:18.049 --> 01:14:19.864
Watch him. Closely.

01:14:19.968 --> 01:14:24.131
If there's the slightest
chance of him getting free,

01:14:24.236 --> 01:14:26.454
don't hesitate to shoot him.

01:14:26.558 --> 01:14:28.581
Just get firm pressure
on the trigger.

01:14:28.685 --> 01:14:30.291
On the trigger.

01:14:30.395 --> 01:14:32.480
And all will be well.

01:14:33.231 --> 01:14:35.317
No.

01:14:35.525 --> 01:14:37.548
You've forgotten one thing.

01:14:37.652 --> 01:14:40.551
Captain Boyle. There's still
the military to reckon with.

01:14:40.655 --> 01:14:42.960
There is no Captain Boyle.

01:14:42.991 --> 01:14:46.536
In consequence,
there'll be no military.

01:14:57.339 --> 01:14:59.361
Mrs Merlyn,
you've got to let me go.

01:14:59.466 --> 01:15:02.586
- Quick.
- Please. Don't move.

01:15:14.564 --> 01:15:17.630
Whoa. Take her round.
Take her round.

01:15:17.734 --> 01:15:19.819
Whoa.

01:15:25.951 --> 01:15:27.973
Up to the beacon with you.
Quick.

01:15:28.078 --> 01:15:29.506
Can't I join in the wreck?

01:15:29.610 --> 01:15:31.894
When you're grown to
a man's size, maybe.

01:15:31.998 --> 01:15:35.189
- I never see anything.
- Off with you.

01:15:49.182 --> 01:15:51.747
Would you like me to bring
you back a nice ring?

01:15:51.851 --> 01:15:54.291
Not including the finger,
if you follow me.

01:15:54.396 --> 01:15:56.554
Come down out of there.

01:15:58.775 --> 01:16:01.079
Hold on to her, Catchpole.

01:16:20.255 --> 01:16:22.695
Mrs Merlyn, where is
the wreck going to be?

01:16:22.799 --> 01:16:24.405
I don't know.

01:16:24.509 --> 01:16:26.949
You can't let it happen.
You must set me free.

01:16:27.053 --> 01:16:30.494
Innocent men and women are going
to die. You'll be responsible.

01:16:30.599 --> 01:16:34.832
You love your husband, I know that. And
I know it's my duty to take him if I can.

01:16:34.936 --> 01:16:37.084
But the men on that
ship have wives, too.

01:16:37.188 --> 01:16:39.628
Think of yourself if
Joss was on board.

01:16:39.733 --> 01:16:42.506
That ship sailing down
from Falmouth in the gale.

01:16:42.611 --> 01:16:45.259
Somewhere on the shore,
a beacon is going out.

01:16:45.363 --> 01:16:47.178
Can you see the rest?

01:16:47.282 --> 01:16:49.790
The ship striking.
Men spread out like flies,

01:16:49.895 --> 01:16:52.516
clinging to the rigging,
screaming at the surf.

01:16:52.621 --> 01:16:54.643
And after the wreck,
the wolves.

01:16:54.748 --> 01:16:57.813
That's why you must let me go.
Tell me where that wreck is.

01:16:57.918 --> 01:17:01.400
I can't. I can't.
I don't know, I tell you.

01:17:01.504 --> 01:17:03.319
I've never known.

01:17:03.423 --> 01:17:05.508
Mrs Merlyn.

01:17:06.468 --> 01:17:08.866
Let me go now and I'll
find out where it is.

01:17:08.970 --> 01:17:10.868
Hurry. There's hardly time.

01:17:10.972 --> 01:17:12.995
I can't.
What will happen to Joss?

01:17:13.099 --> 01:17:15.637
You must make a choice.
The lives of those men...

01:17:15.742 --> 01:17:17.750
...and of other men
in the future or Joss?

01:17:17.854 --> 01:17:20.086
After all,
Joss is only one man.

01:17:20.190 --> 01:17:22.275
Yes, but he's my man.

01:17:25.612 --> 01:17:29.600
Mrs Merlyn, supposing
I allow your husband...

01:17:48.468 --> 01:17:50.553
Hey.

01:17:51.221 --> 01:17:54.078
- Whoa-up.
- Where's the nearest military garrison?

01:17:54.182 --> 01:17:55.996
- Bodmin. Why?
- I want your coach.

01:17:56.101 --> 01:18:01.507
Give me those reins in the name
of the law. Here's my warrant.

01:18:14.035 --> 01:18:16.121
There she is. Look.

01:20:35.218 --> 01:20:40.004
A light. Barnard's Head.
Hard a'port.

01:21:04.956 --> 01:21:06.979
She's the one that did it.

01:21:07.083 --> 01:21:10.894
Women are no good here,
bring you bad luck.

01:21:11.087 --> 01:21:13.110
All right, Joss.
You leave her to us.

01:21:13.214 --> 01:21:16.405
We'll manage very nicely.
Thank you.

01:21:16.801 --> 01:21:19.075
I'm sure you'll agree, Harry.

01:21:19.179 --> 01:21:22.495
This calls for my attention.
This is where I come into my own.

01:21:22.599 --> 01:21:24.830
Let her go.
Get into that cart quick.

01:21:24.935 --> 01:21:26.665
Keep back there.

01:21:26.770 --> 01:21:29.585
- You can't take her.
- She's robbed us of our best cargo ever.

01:21:29.689 --> 01:21:32.046
Fetch her down.
Robbed you? Thank heaven.

01:21:32.150 --> 01:21:34.377
Robbed of your chance to
stuff your pockets...

01:21:34.482 --> 01:21:36.759
...by murdering innocent
devils you've never seen.

01:21:36.863 --> 01:21:38.761
I'm glad.
I don't care what happens.

01:21:38.865 --> 01:21:42.765
- I'm glad.
- Shut your mouth, you little fool.

01:21:53.838 --> 01:21:56.237
I don't know how long my
business will take me.

01:21:56.341 --> 01:21:58.989
- I may be away for some weeks.
- Very good, sir.

01:21:59.094 --> 01:22:00.908
- Sir Humphrey.
- What is it, Sam?

01:22:01.012 --> 01:22:04.829
I couldn't deliver this note. The
regiment left Truro three weeks ago.

01:22:04.933 --> 01:22:07.998
- Nobody's heard of any Captain Boyle.
- Extraordinary.

01:22:08.103 --> 01:22:10.960
- Shall I try Bodmin?
- No, no, it's of no importance.

01:22:11.064 --> 01:22:16.648
That'll be all, Chadwick. I can't
give you my address in France.

01:22:24.869 --> 01:22:26.434
- Sir.
- What?

01:22:26.538 --> 01:22:28.269
Well, er, Chadwick?

01:22:28.373 --> 01:22:30.020
You'll pardon the liberty.

01:22:30.125 --> 01:22:32.210
You're not ill?

01:22:32.752 --> 01:22:34.483
Ill, Chadwick?

01:22:34.588 --> 01:22:36.068
Ill?

01:22:36.172 --> 01:22:38.696
I've never felt
better in my life.

01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:40.885
Come here.

01:22:41.386 --> 01:22:43.117
The fact is I'm, er...

01:22:43.221 --> 01:22:44.952
...growing younger.

01:22:45.056 --> 01:22:46.537
Come here.

01:22:46.641 --> 01:22:47.986
So much younger I'm taking...

01:22:48.091 --> 01:22:50.207
...a beautiful young girl
with me on my travels.

01:22:50.312 --> 01:22:52.668
Yes, sir.
Is there anything more?

01:22:52.772 --> 01:22:53.815
Yes, you fool.

01:22:53.919 --> 01:22:55.546
Don't stand there with
that look in your eyes.

01:22:55.650 --> 01:22:57.256
- Sam.
- Sir?

01:22:57.360 --> 01:23:00.301
Keep the mare and bay
in good condition, won't you?

01:23:00.405 --> 01:23:02.490
And, er, come here.

01:23:02.532 --> 01:23:04.618
Watch Chadwick.

01:23:04.659 --> 01:23:06.474
His mind's going.

01:23:06.578 --> 01:23:08.476
Hm.

01:23:08.580 --> 01:23:11.505
Drive on, will you.

01:23:17.255 --> 01:23:18.986
Mr Chadwick.

01:23:19.090 --> 01:23:20.821
He's, erm...

01:23:20.926 --> 01:23:24.293
I've seen that coming
along for years.

01:23:29.643 --> 01:23:32.213
Aunt Patience. Aunt Patience.

01:23:33.647 --> 01:23:36.217
Aunt Patience. Aunt Patience.

01:23:38.944 --> 01:23:41.425
Mary. Joss. What's happened?

01:23:41.488 --> 01:23:43.219
Joss is hurt.

01:23:43.323 --> 01:23:45.408
Careful, Joss. Joss.

01:23:48.203 --> 01:23:49.934
Mary.

01:23:52.916 --> 01:23:54.939
Mary. Mary, what happened?

01:23:55.043 --> 01:24:01.779
I stopped the wreck. The men came for
me and Joss saved me and they shot him.

01:24:14.187 --> 01:24:16.273
Uhh.

01:24:21.152 --> 01:24:23.238
Joss, Joss.

01:24:24.072 --> 01:24:26.157
Oh, Patience.

01:24:26.783 --> 01:24:28.868
Patience, my dear.

01:24:29.494 --> 01:24:32.351
You're all right, Joss.
I'm taking care of you.

01:24:32.455 --> 01:24:35.077
You're a good girl, Patience.

01:24:37.544 --> 01:24:39.629
I'm sorry.

01:24:47.971 --> 01:24:50.327
Where's Jem?
Aunt Patience, he's not?

01:24:50.432 --> 01:24:52.163
I set him free.

01:24:52.267 --> 01:24:54.571
He went to find the wreck.

01:24:55.395 --> 01:24:58.335
Mary, he promised me
he'd let Joss escape.

01:24:58.440 --> 01:25:00.809
You know what that means.
We can leave here.

01:25:00.913 --> 01:25:03.007
We can leave here together,
Joss and I.

01:25:03.111 --> 01:25:06.260
You must help me, Mary. We
must go quickly while we can.

01:25:06.364 --> 01:25:08.095
Mary, we'll begin again.

01:25:08.199 --> 01:25:10.097
Think of it. To be able
to live without fear...

01:25:10.201 --> 01:25:12.120
...among different people
who don't know us.

01:25:12.224 --> 01:25:13.267
Yes, Aunt Patience.

01:25:13.371 --> 01:25:16.520
It'll be like those first days in
Bodmin. Joss was different then.

01:25:16.625 --> 01:25:18.355
He's strong.

01:25:18.460 --> 01:25:21.296
He'll soon get better,
won't he?

01:25:22.464 --> 01:25:24.549
Of course.

01:25:25.634 --> 01:25:28.240
When he's recovered a little,
we must move him.

01:25:28.345 --> 01:25:31.827
We can't wait. Joss mustn't be
here when... when he comes back.

01:25:31.932 --> 01:25:33.245
Who?

01:25:33.350 --> 01:25:35.581
Oh, Mary, I haven't told you.

01:25:35.685 --> 01:25:38.882
I didn't know myself until
tonight, but I've always...

01:25:38.987 --> 01:25:40.920
...known Joss wasn't
his own master.

01:25:41.024 --> 01:25:43.063
There's someone else who
planned the wrecks...

01:25:43.168 --> 01:25:44.298
...and had Joss in his power.

01:25:44.402 --> 01:25:46.425
Tonight I found out who.
Mary, it's...

01:25:57.499 --> 01:26:00.069
Aunt Patience. Aunt Patience.

01:26:02.295 --> 01:26:04.381
Life without Patience?

01:26:06.591 --> 01:26:08.677
Get me a drink.

01:26:13.056 --> 01:26:15.141
Yes, Joss, yes.

01:26:40.166 --> 01:26:42.825
A good, clean shot, wasn't it?

01:26:43.712 --> 01:26:45.797
I'm sorry.

01:26:45.839 --> 01:26:49.447
Poor creature. She has suffered so much.
But I was forced to do it, you see.

01:26:49.551 --> 01:26:54.076
She was going to tell you
about me. I didn't like that.

01:26:54.180 --> 01:26:56.662
I wanted to tell you myself.

01:26:59.352 --> 01:27:02.418
So, you stopped the wreck?
Pity. I was counting on it.

01:27:02.522 --> 01:27:06.797
You're a very brave young lady, but
you've made my position very difficult.

01:27:06.902 --> 01:27:10.342
- Let me go. Let me go.
- Please don't scream like that.

01:27:10.447 --> 01:27:13.411
I shall have to put
this handkerchief...

01:27:13.515 --> 01:27:16.932
...in your mouth. You must
tell me if that hurts.

01:27:17.037 --> 01:27:19.143
Of course, you can't.
How silly of me.

01:27:19.247 --> 01:27:22.881
Put your hands down.
Put your hands down.

01:27:22.918 --> 01:27:26.108
Or I shall have to
tie them up, too.

01:27:27.505 --> 01:27:29.591
Right.

01:27:31.676 --> 01:27:36.671
This will prevent the cord
from cutting your wrists.

01:27:38.141 --> 01:27:40.790
You see,
you're quite alone now.

01:27:40.894 --> 01:27:42.875
You have no-one
else in the world.

01:27:42.979 --> 01:27:44.919
Except myself.

01:27:45.023 --> 01:27:47.948
So I'm going to
take care of you.

01:27:48.151 --> 01:27:52.528
Er... in fact,
we're going away together.

01:27:52.697 --> 01:27:55.471
We should be going now.
Trehearne may come back.

01:27:55.575 --> 01:27:57.598
You'd better put this on.

01:27:57.702 --> 01:28:01.060
It's wise to wrap up well,
while this cold wind is blowing.

01:28:01.164 --> 01:28:04.772
I'm always telling people
they can't be too careful.

01:28:04.876 --> 01:28:06.899
But they think
they know better.

01:28:07.003 --> 01:28:12.113
And you wouldn't want people to
see you like that, would you?

01:28:12.217 --> 01:28:13.531
There.

01:28:13.635 --> 01:28:17.798
I'm er...
glad you're quiet now.

01:28:22.936 --> 01:28:25.021
Now, come along.

01:28:25.063 --> 01:28:27.684
My coach is not far away.

01:28:35.865 --> 01:28:37.951
But we must hurry.

01:28:37.993 --> 01:28:40.078
We must hurry.

01:28:40.912 --> 01:28:42.998
We must hurry.

01:28:53.717 --> 01:28:55.802
Sir Humphrey.

01:28:55.844 --> 01:28:57.450
And the girl's with him.

01:28:57.554 --> 01:29:00.745
- But Joss, what about Joss?
- Come on.

01:29:07.814 --> 01:29:09.837
Trehearne's gone, too.

01:29:09.941 --> 01:29:12.027
Joss. Joss.

01:29:12.068 --> 01:29:14.727
Harry, here. Quick.

01:29:17.532 --> 01:29:19.618
Dead. Both of them.

01:29:20.702 --> 01:29:24.602
You shouldn't have done
that to Joss, Harry.

01:29:25.540 --> 01:29:29.351
If you ask me, it's er...
time we moved on.

01:29:35.133 --> 01:29:37.656
What are you all standing
there for? Get out.

01:29:37.761 --> 01:29:40.331
Don't keep together. Scatter.

01:29:41.389 --> 01:29:43.475
Soldiers.

01:29:49.731 --> 01:29:51.545
Now, where's that girl?

01:29:51.650 --> 01:29:54.590
- That's the question.
- Come on now, where is she? Tell me.

01:29:54.694 --> 01:29:56.128
Take it calm now,
take it calm.

01:29:56.232 --> 01:29:58.385
You're going to be
disappointed, Mr Trehearne.

01:29:58.490 --> 01:30:00.930
She's gone and found herself
another gentleman.

01:30:01.034 --> 01:30:03.599
I just seen her sneaking
off alone with His Worship.

01:30:03.703 --> 01:30:05.826
The squire.

01:30:05.997 --> 01:30:08.020
We've got to find them,
Captain.

01:30:08.124 --> 01:30:13.531
Sergeant, I want six men to ride
with Mr Trehearne and myself.

01:30:18.551 --> 01:30:20.658
I don't like it.
I don't like it at all.

01:30:20.762 --> 01:30:24.328
It was breaking that... that bit
of looking glass that did it.

01:30:24.432 --> 01:30:27.446
I told you.
Seven years' bad luck.

01:30:27.602 --> 01:30:30.459
No, Dandy, not more than seven
days. Not counting eternity.

01:30:30.563 --> 01:30:32.503
What'll they do?
What'll happen to us?

01:30:32.607 --> 01:30:34.722
Lt'll be a proper
public execution...

01:30:34.826 --> 01:30:37.466
...with the women watching.
I'll make 'em sit up.

01:30:37.571 --> 01:30:39.656
I'm ready. Ready.

01:30:42.909 --> 01:30:46.559
- That won't do, will it?
- Better tie him up.

01:30:46.663 --> 01:30:48.748
Why are you doing that?

01:30:48.790 --> 01:30:50.813
Why can't I be chained? Stop.

01:30:50.917 --> 01:30:52.940
Stop. I want to be
chained like the others.

01:30:53.044 --> 01:30:55.130
Listen to me.

01:30:55.171 --> 01:30:59.071
I've got a right to be. I'm the same as
them. I've done what they've done, haven't I?

01:30:59.175 --> 01:31:01.391
I want to hang with them.

01:31:02.304 --> 01:31:04.389
You'll hang me.

01:31:04.431 --> 01:31:06.516
I don't want to hang.

01:31:06.558 --> 01:31:09.707
I don't want to die. Not yet.
I'm only a boy. I'm only 17.

01:31:09.811 --> 01:31:11.834
You won't let them, will you?

01:31:11.938 --> 01:31:14.795
I only did what I was told.
I never killed anybody.

01:31:14.899 --> 01:31:16.922
I never even went
near the wrecks.

01:31:17.027 --> 01:31:19.759
So you can't hang me.
You mustn't. You daren't.

01:31:19.863 --> 01:31:21.886
Because I don't want to die.

01:31:21.990 --> 01:31:24.383
I don't want to die.

01:31:40.133 --> 01:31:42.885
There's my house. Do you see?

01:31:43.053 --> 01:31:45.138
Across the bay.

01:31:46.181 --> 01:31:48.621
The Pengallans have
been there a long time.

01:31:48.725 --> 01:31:50.941
I may never see it again.

01:31:52.771 --> 01:31:55.711
Because, you see, we may
never be able to come back.

01:31:55.815 --> 01:31:57.838
We may be going a long way,
you know.

01:31:57.943 --> 01:31:59.965
Nearer the sun, of course.

01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:03.172
Italy perhaps.
The Isles of Greece.

01:32:03.198 --> 01:32:05.221
You're thinking
that'll cost money,

01:32:05.325 --> 01:32:07.348
but there, I have enough.

01:32:07.452 --> 01:32:09.908
One must have enough.

01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:12.937
I always knew that to
live like a gentleman,

01:32:13.041 --> 01:32:17.502
spaciously and with elegance,
one must have money.

01:32:17.671 --> 01:32:23.077
And a few beautiful possessions,
of course, like you, my dear.

01:32:35.105 --> 01:32:36.155
Where's Sir Humphrey?

01:32:36.259 --> 01:32:38.254
Sir Humphrey has gone
away on business.

01:32:38.358 --> 01:32:40.089
- Where?
- Answer, man, answer.

01:32:40.193 --> 01:32:43.759
Sir Humphrey is taking the
Falmouth night packet to St-Malo.

01:32:43.863 --> 01:32:46.971
I say, I say, what's this?
Oh, it's you.

01:32:47.075 --> 01:32:49.160
Good heavens. My suit.

01:32:49.202 --> 01:32:51.725
These gentlemen are enquiring
for Sir Humphrey, sir.

01:32:51.830 --> 01:32:55.967
Sir Humphrey is the head
of a band of wreckers...

01:32:56.072 --> 01:32:59.528
...who are under
arrest at Jamaica Inn.

01:33:33.705 --> 01:33:35.728
Sweet China oranges.

01:33:35.832 --> 01:33:37.918
Sweet China.

01:33:42.255 --> 01:33:44.278
I've put your luggage below,
sir.

01:33:44.382 --> 01:33:47.031
Sir Humphrey Pengallan.
The large stateroom.

01:33:47.135 --> 01:33:49.784
Are you the steward?
Get me a bottle of brandy.

01:33:49.888 --> 01:33:53.522
Very good, sir.
This way, sir. Follow me.

01:33:58.939 --> 01:34:03.459
What a miserable hole.
Is this the best they've got?

01:34:04.110 --> 01:34:06.196
Old traveller, though.

01:34:06.238 --> 01:34:08.693
I'll make you comfortable.

01:34:13.119 --> 01:34:15.101
I never really
cared for wrecking.

01:34:15.205 --> 01:34:18.687
After all, not my kind of thing,
hobnobbing with cut-throats.

01:34:18.792 --> 01:34:21.941
It had to be done. Half my
friends living like paupers.

01:34:22.045 --> 01:34:27.895
But I'm living like a prince.
Drowned hundreds of sailors to do it.

01:34:28.927 --> 01:34:31.012
But like a prince.

01:34:32.222 --> 01:34:35.413
And I'll make a
princess out of you.

01:34:51.283 --> 01:34:54.890
I believe you're sorry, because
you're not marrying some oaf,

01:34:54.995 --> 01:35:00.499
who'd father on you a dozen
snivelling, dirty-nosed brats.

01:35:02.752 --> 01:35:08.292
Any man of sensibility would
rather see you dead first.

01:35:12.971 --> 01:35:15.056
Gangplank away.

01:35:18.393 --> 01:35:21.125
In Paris you'll have your
woman to attend to you.

01:35:21.229 --> 01:35:23.252
I'll see to your
new clothes myself.

01:35:23.356 --> 01:35:25.796
Yes, I'll dress you, my dear.

01:35:25.901 --> 01:35:30.952
And we'll put silk next to
that smooth skin of yours, hmm?

01:35:31.948 --> 01:35:34.263
Pale green silk,
I think, what?

01:35:38.622 --> 01:35:40.707
Pah. Stop crying.

01:35:40.749 --> 01:35:42.964
Stop it, you little fool.

01:35:44.002 --> 01:35:47.818
Be beautiful. Hard as nails if you
like, but you must be beautiful.

01:35:47.923 --> 01:35:51.697
Well, you have to be hard now.
The age of chivalry has gone.

01:35:58.975 --> 01:36:01.832
That's it. Bring her
back to the quayside.

01:36:01.937 --> 01:36:04.794
Troopers.
They may be coming for you.

01:36:04.898 --> 01:36:06.837
Of course,
you can't go with them.

01:36:06.942 --> 01:36:08.756
You shouldn't have done that,
my child.

01:36:08.860 --> 01:36:13.735
Lots of riffraff about. Things
might be most unpleasant.

01:36:27.504 --> 01:36:29.589
Captain Johnson.

01:36:29.631 --> 01:36:31.716
I'm here.

01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:33.885
Sir Humphrey Pengallan.

01:36:33.969 --> 01:36:37.034
Give yourself up, I beg you,
Sir Humphrey, and let her go.

01:36:37.138 --> 01:36:39.036
Pray, keep your distance.

01:36:39.140 --> 01:36:41.799
Careful. Wing him if possible.

01:36:41.893 --> 01:36:44.208
Take care. Lean away from
him as far as you can.

01:36:44.312 --> 01:36:47.795
No, don't shoot. He can't help himself.
He doesn't know what he's doing.

01:36:47.899 --> 01:36:50.521
He's mad, I tell you. Mad.

01:36:54.864 --> 01:36:56.429
It's safer here.

01:36:56.533 --> 01:36:59.635
Port bow line ashore there.

01:37:03.665 --> 01:37:05.750
It must be now.

01:37:09.004 --> 01:37:11.162
Please be still.

01:37:23.184 --> 01:37:26.542
Jem, don't harm him. It's not
his fault. He can't help himself.

01:37:26.646 --> 01:37:28.732
Come down.

01:37:28.773 --> 01:37:31.547
Come down from the rigging
and give yourself up.

01:37:31.651 --> 01:37:33.737
Come down.

01:37:33.778 --> 01:37:35.906
Come down, Sir Humphrey.

01:37:40.201 --> 01:37:43.238
Come down, sir. Come down.

01:37:43.413 --> 01:37:47.490
Good heavens, what's the
squire doing up there?

01:37:50.921 --> 01:37:53.652
Come down, Sir Humphrey,
and give yourself up.

01:37:53.757 --> 01:37:57.073
You'll not be harmed,
I promise you. Come down, sir.

01:37:57.177 --> 01:38:00.513
I shall be down to you
before you're up to me,

01:38:00.618 --> 01:38:01.660
Mr Trehearne.

01:38:01.765 --> 01:38:05.399
If you'll be kind
enough to give me room.

01:38:09.522 --> 01:38:13.599
- Bring that man down.
- All right, sir.

01:38:19.783 --> 01:38:22.306
What are
you all waiting for?

01:38:22.410 --> 01:38:24.225
A spectacle?

01:38:24.329 --> 01:38:26.414
You shall have it.

01:38:26.456 --> 01:38:30.147
And tell your children
how the great age ended.

01:38:30.252 --> 01:38:33.122
Make way for Pengallan.

01:39:03.827 --> 01:39:06.574
Chadwick.

01:39:06.955 --> 01:39:09.040
Chadwick.
