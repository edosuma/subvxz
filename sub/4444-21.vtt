00:00.617 --> 00:01.819
Previously on The Fosters:

00:01.825 --> 00:04.289
- So you can go on the tour.
- But I want to go to Idyllwild.

00:04.293 --> 00:06.242
Classical music has been everything.

00:06.252 --> 00:09.263
What kind of idiot breaks into somebody's
house in the middle of the night?

00:09.298 --> 00:11.813
- I snuck out so I could see Jude, all right.
- What does that mean?

00:11.839 --> 00:13.424
We had some girls come into our tent.

00:13.432 --> 00:14.653
We ended up making out with them.

00:14.678 --> 00:15.614
And you don't have to worry about me

00:15.621 --> 00:16.326
and Connor hanging out.

00:16.359 --> 00:18.665
Because his dad said we're not
allowed to be friends anymore, OK.

00:19.312 --> 00:20.423
It wasn't an accident.

00:20.430 --> 00:21.390
Why... would you... ?

00:21.406 --> 00:22.733
Sometimes I just wanna die.

00:22.755 --> 00:25.103
As soon as you're emancipated
we can adopt you right away.

00:25.119 --> 00:28.952
And you do need to keep this from
Robert, which we don't feel good about.

00:28.967 --> 00:29.770
I'm Ana's daughter.

00:29.781 --> 00:32.365
We didn't even know that you
existed until it was too late.

00:32.387 --> 00:33.416
You were already adopted.

00:33.457 --> 00:34.955
- I met our grandparents.
- You did?

00:34.969 --> 00:36.523
I tried to get them to take Ana's baby.

00:36.558 --> 00:38.310
You're decided, 100 percent?

00:38.327 --> 00:39.652
Once I give her to Stef and Lena,

00:39.681 --> 00:41.749
she's gonna grow up in a wonderful home

00:41.778 --> 00:43.356
with her brother and sister.

00:43.616 --> 00:46.502
Remember we decided not to
tell the kids about the baby?

00:46.535 --> 00:48.380
Well, we might want to get on that.

00:50.506 --> 00:51.921
Is she gonna be here the whole time?

00:51.939 --> 00:53.069
Like, when is she having this baby?

00:53.113 --> 00:54.991
We're really not quite sure, sweetheart.

00:55.016 --> 00:57.319
- Well, when is she due?
- Six weeks.

00:57.346 --> 00:59.409
I'm supposed to give up
my room for six weeks?

01:04.153 --> 01:05.529
Hi, Ana, um...

01:05.899 --> 01:07.331
can I get you some coffee?

01:07.356 --> 01:09.637
- Are you still drinking coffee?
- Um, tea?

01:09.666 --> 01:10.934
Yeah, we can do that.

01:13.902 --> 01:15.930
You can sit there. Jude's still asleep.

01:17.480 --> 01:19.859
I don't wanna put Brandon out.

01:19.918 --> 01:22.848
Oh, no, it's fine, really. Not a big deal.

01:22.903 --> 01:25.881
Uh, Ana can I get you something
to eat, some eggs... maybe?

01:25.936 --> 01:27.091
Oh, thank you.

01:27.150 --> 01:28.794
- The smell makes me a little...
- Sick?

01:29.218 --> 01:30.482
I remember that.

01:33.994 --> 01:36.676
Oh, Mama, did we hear anything
from St. Tristan's yet?

01:36.731 --> 01:39.213
Are they gonna loan us their
auditorium for the dance-off Monday?

01:39.254 --> 01:41.226
- Yes, they are.
- Excellent!

01:41.503 --> 01:45.381
Oh, there are two dance teams for the
school but only one can represent at States.

01:45.436 --> 01:47.317
So we're doing a dance-off
so the students can decide.

01:47.329 --> 01:49.999
- Oh, that sounds exciting.
- And stressful.

01:50.024 --> 01:52.732
It's become, like, a thing, and now
the whole student body wants to come.

01:52.784 --> 01:54.497
- Oh, please, you love it.
- Shut up.

01:54.559 --> 01:55.860
Hey, language, please.

01:56.716 --> 01:58.827
When you were little,
anytime I'd put music on,

01:58.842 --> 02:02.442
you'd wear one of my old t-shirts like
a dress and you'd dance all around.

02:02.618 --> 02:04.898
And, of course, we had to
watch you or you'd get so mad.

02:05.059 --> 02:07.196
Really? I don't remember that.

02:07.598 --> 02:08.526
I do.

02:08.833 --> 02:10.133
And some things never change.

02:14.106 --> 02:17.030
So, Jesus, I spoke with the
recruiter from Flintwood.

02:17.044 --> 02:18.736
He's going to come and
sit down with us tonight.

02:18.736 --> 02:19.537
Really?

02:21.291 --> 02:23.951
- Oh, Jesus might go to boarding school.
- Yes, might.

02:24.006 --> 02:25.343
Don't get yourself all worked up.

02:25.354 --> 02:26.414
We're just gonna hear him out.

02:27.265 --> 02:28.482
Callie, can I make you some toast?

02:28.504 --> 02:30.887
- Or something else to eat?
- No, I'm OK.

02:31.420 --> 02:34.000
I gotta get ready. Robert'll be here soon.

02:36.835 --> 02:39.064
I'm gonna finish getting ready for work.

02:42.295 --> 02:44.085
I'm really excited about the baby.

02:45.420 --> 02:46.467
Well, I'm just

02:46.515 --> 02:48.568
really glad your moms decided to take her.

02:52.921 --> 02:53.878
Hey, Callie?

02:54.455 --> 02:55.540
I know this is hard.

02:55.564 --> 02:56.809
I'm OK.

02:56.839 --> 02:59.480
Hopefully we'll get you
emancipated before you

02:59.487 --> 03:00.880
have to spend another
weekend with the Quinns.

03:00.909 --> 03:03.986
But, until then, just please
remember that you can't say anything.

03:04.633 --> 03:06.237
I know.

03:11.440 --> 03:13.004
I hate how ugly this has gotten.

03:13.190 --> 03:14.323
I know. You don't approve.

03:14.334 --> 03:16.457
But I'm just trying to
keep Callie under this roof.

04:02.269 --> 04:05.233
What's gonna happen if Ana's parents
decide they wanna take this baby?

04:05.236 --> 04:06.128
What's going on?

04:07.162 --> 04:09.611
- I went back to see our grandparents.
- Why?

04:09.731 --> 04:11.522
She asked them to take this baby.

04:11.540 --> 04:12.541
Moms want it.

04:12.661 --> 04:15.055
OK, yeah, I know that
moms want the baby. Now.

04:15.066 --> 04:16.846
I think you should just tell moms, OK.

04:16.872 --> 04:19.338
In case they try to fight
them for it or something.

04:19.367 --> 04:20.369
OK, It's a her.

04:20.533 --> 04:21.567
And they're not going to.

04:21.593 --> 04:23.161
They're gonna be relieved.
Because they're old.

04:23.205 --> 04:25.286
They don't want to have to raise
a child if they don't have to.

04:25.320 --> 04:26.187
Trust me.

04:26.658 --> 04:27.670
I've got this.

04:29.709 --> 04:32.154
It's just a casual lunch
with my dad and his wife.

04:32.333 --> 04:34.394
- They want to meet you.
- Hi.

04:34.581 --> 04:36.345
Oh, my God. Sophia!

04:37.154 --> 04:39.777
- You told her.
- Uh, yeah, sorry.

04:39.791 --> 04:40.931
It's OK.

04:41.743 --> 04:44.926
I guess you've probably had
enough surprises from me.

04:46.153 --> 04:47.834
- Too soon?
- Maybe a little.

04:49.899 --> 04:50.886
How are you?

04:52.214 --> 04:53.086
Good.

04:54.427 --> 04:55.019
Really.

04:55.041 --> 04:56.167
And happy to be home.

04:57.419 --> 04:59.334
Look, I'm wearing your...

04:59.522 --> 05:01.970
Oh, yeah. They look really nice.

05:02.090 --> 05:03.205
I love them.

05:03.834 --> 05:05.438
- Thank you.
- Yeah, no, of course.

05:07.791 --> 05:09.607
I'm really glad to see you.

05:12.078 --> 05:14.205
Yeah, I'm really glad to see you, too.

05:15.270 --> 05:16.423
Come here.

05:52.485 --> 05:53.663
Excuse me,

05:53.941 --> 05:55.960
I'm looking for Connor Stevens's room?

05:55.992 --> 05:58.536
- And you are... ?
- His cousin.

05:59.134 --> 06:01.003
Uh, 325. Down the hall.

06:17.754 --> 06:18.862
What are you doing here?

06:19.256 --> 06:21.268
I told your mom I don't want
you hanging around Connor.

06:21.303 --> 06:22.157
I know.

06:23.162 --> 06:24.447
I wanna see him.

06:24.915 --> 06:26.154
I wanna see my friend.

06:26.183 --> 06:27.964
And I'm not leaving until I do.

06:32.869 --> 06:34.936
She'll grow up in a great, big family

06:34.964 --> 06:37.141
with, like, the two best moms in the world.

06:37.185 --> 06:41.143
And I know Ana tried really
hard to keep you apart from us,

06:41.177 --> 06:43.798
but I know my moms'll
want you to know the baby,

06:46.893 --> 06:47.955
Right?

06:49.810 --> 06:50.541
What?

06:50.775 --> 06:52.166
Yeah, sure, OK.

06:54.349 --> 06:56.612
And Ana's staying with
us, until the baby's born

06:56.631 --> 06:58.201
so you don't have to worry about her.

06:58.586 --> 07:00.389
I mean. If you were.

07:01.821 --> 07:04.914
So everything's gonna work out fine.

07:08.381 --> 07:09.180
Of course.

07:10.566 --> 07:12.081
Who makes those?

07:12.999 --> 07:15.352
Oh, I do.

07:15.538 --> 07:17.432
It's a family tradition,

07:17.463 --> 07:19.824
one for every child and grandchild.

07:20.016 --> 07:21.729
Wow. There's a lot of 'em...

07:22.629 --> 07:24.538
You think, maybe one
day, we could meet them?

07:25.269 --> 07:27.343
I think that could be arranged.

07:30.121 --> 07:32.792
Well, we should probably get home,

07:32.809 --> 07:35.026
but thank you for the
bunuelos, they were delicious.

07:35.665 --> 07:37.151
Well...

07:38.294 --> 07:40.595
OK, bye.

07:42.290 --> 07:44.366
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

07:48.765 --> 07:50.187
They're good kids.

07:50.221 --> 07:52.294
Their moms are doing a good job.

07:53.219 --> 07:55.205
But are you really OK with that family

07:55.217 --> 07:57.101
raising another one of our grandchildren?

07:59.814 --> 08:02.070
They call it a personality disorder,

08:02.127 --> 08:04.819
which makes me laugh 'cause
I feel like it sounds like

08:04.856 --> 08:07.278
I think I'm the Queen
of England or something,

08:07.968 --> 08:10.073
which it's totally not.

08:10.142 --> 08:13.682
I mean, it's a chemical imbalance,

08:14.253 --> 08:16.039
an illness, it's

08:16.263 --> 08:18.670
not something that I have to be...

08:18.739 --> 08:20.216
Be ashamed of, right?

08:20.904 --> 08:21.799
Right.

08:22.256 --> 08:24.243
It just made me feel so hopeless.

08:24.717 --> 08:27.824
Like I was never gonna be normal.

08:30.241 --> 08:32.581
I know what it's like
to feel hopeless, so...

08:33.684 --> 08:34.932
I'm sorry.

08:36.229 --> 08:38.541
So, where is my favorite girl?

08:38.621 --> 08:40.601
Papaw!

08:40.721 --> 08:44.493
Oh, sweetie, oh. It is so
go to see you back home.

08:44.653 --> 08:46.197
Let me get a look at you.

08:46.737 --> 08:47.947
Pretty as a picture.

08:49.610 --> 08:51.400
Dad. This is Callie.

08:51.434 --> 08:53.510
Callie, this is my father, Robert Senior.

08:54.516 --> 08:55.242
Callie.

08:56.608 --> 08:57.901
It's a pleasure to meet you.

08:58.558 --> 09:00.148
Wow, it's true,

09:00.509 --> 09:03.158
you two are the spitting image
of each other! My goodness!

09:03.884 --> 09:06.022
- This is my wife.
- Monica.

09:08.818 --> 09:11.609
If we just pull a little
from here and slide it there

09:11.646 --> 09:14.903
we should be able to cover the
expenses we're red-lining until,

09:14.971 --> 09:17.109
fingers crossed, we get the Kilfer grant.

09:17.155 --> 09:20.310
- When do you think we'll hear?
- Any day now, I think.

09:24.300 --> 09:25.177
You OK?

09:25.762 --> 09:28.671
You look a little stressed. I mean,

09:29.242 --> 09:32.233
as stressed, as someone as
beautiful as you can look.

09:32.353 --> 09:34.843
That's very kind of you.

09:36.734 --> 09:37.853
Um...

09:39.644 --> 09:41.896
Stef moved Ana into the house.

09:44.170 --> 09:46.469
Stef did? By herself?

09:46.882 --> 09:49.840
I guess she was living
somewhere really terrible, and,

09:50.057 --> 09:52.204
so, Stef packed her up and moved her home.

09:52.324 --> 09:53.597
Without talking to you?

09:53.639 --> 09:56.431
Yeah, well, she's been
doing a lot of that lately.

09:56.551 --> 09:58.095
I'm sorry.

09:58.468 --> 10:00.704
My ex was a bit of a one man band.

10:00.715 --> 10:03.066
I didn't get much of a say in anything.

10:04.167 --> 10:05.902
Finally, I just had to leave him.

10:08.575 --> 10:10.973
Not that our situations are the same.

10:12.482 --> 10:14.426
We just

10:15.084 --> 10:16.450
weren't right for each other.

10:18.844 --> 10:21.124
Yeah, sometimes I think
that's why I lost the baby.

10:21.244 --> 10:23.170
Because I knew we weren't gonna make it.

10:24.454 --> 10:27.362
Well, a newborn can test
the best of marriages.

10:28.789 --> 10:30.456
You have to be in a good place.

10:33.436 --> 10:34.257
Oh.

10:34.536 --> 10:35.623
It's Connor's dad.

10:37.898 --> 10:38.775
Hello?

10:47.650 --> 10:48.477
Hmm.

10:48.975 --> 10:51.163
That's a beautiful piece, B. What's it,

10:51.497 --> 10:52.598
Chopin?

10:56.828 --> 10:57.920
Brahms? What?

10:57.929 --> 11:01.515
Uh, well, first off,
it's a contemporary piece.

11:01.531 --> 11:03.565
And... I composed it.

11:04.283 --> 11:05.124
Get out.

11:06.658 --> 11:08.184
Are you sure you're my son?

11:08.741 --> 11:12.290
I don't know, I just figured
if Idyllwild sees I can compose,

11:12.308 --> 11:13.820
they might cut me some
slack on the playing.

11:13.940 --> 11:15.510
You gotta get outta your head.

11:15.529 --> 11:17.178
You're gonna blow 'em away.

11:17.658 --> 11:20.568
Hey, what should I have for the
lady from Idyllwild on Monday?

11:20.596 --> 11:23.817
I mean, coffee, tea? Something to snack on?

11:23.821 --> 11:25.549
I think anything's fine.

11:25.905 --> 11:27.143
Thanks for letting me do it here.

11:28.025 --> 11:29.432
I didn't want her coming to the house.

11:29.458 --> 11:31.222
You still haven't told your mom yet, huh?

11:31.716 --> 11:36.826
No, I just don't want everyone
finding out if I don't get in...

11:38.367 --> 11:39.652
So you can still go on tour?

11:40.008 --> 11:40.725
No.

11:41.400 --> 11:43.398
No, Lou's... we're done.

11:44.079 --> 11:45.239
There's not gonna be any tour.

11:46.130 --> 11:47.409
For me, anyway.

11:48.943 --> 11:51.132
I just hope I didn't
blow it all for nothing.

11:53.095 --> 11:54.018
Look, B,

11:54.138 --> 11:55.626
you wanna play dive bars,

11:55.746 --> 11:57.038
I'll be at every gig.

11:57.284 --> 12:01.003
But this is special, B. This is your gift.

12:01.181 --> 12:02.390
It's not nothin'.

12:11.719 --> 12:13.318
I'm gonna go get a cup of coffee,

12:13.438 --> 12:14.606
and when I come back,

12:16.305 --> 12:18.005
otherwise I'm gonna call security.

12:30.996 --> 12:33.742
I know how hard this must
be for you, honey, I do.

12:35.751 --> 12:38.885
Losing a friend is one of the
most painful things to go through.

12:41.266 --> 12:42.933
Mr. Stevens made it very clear...

12:42.960 --> 12:44.368
He's not my friend.

12:45.966 --> 12:47.835
Connor's not your friend?

12:51.974 --> 12:53.248
There were no girls.

12:55.377 --> 12:56.327
In the tent.

12:57.026 --> 12:58.360
On the camping trip.

13:00.545 --> 13:01.888
It was just us.

13:03.249 --> 13:04.486
We kissed.

13:05.227 --> 13:06.588
And now we're kinda like...

13:08.264 --> 13:09.940
More than friends?

13:18.825 --> 13:19.729
Connor...

13:20.543 --> 13:22.435
- he told his dad...
- Oh...

13:27.860 --> 13:29.411
Shh.

13:52.368 --> 13:53.470
Hey.

13:53.778 --> 13:55.006
Hey.

14:00.509 --> 14:03.525
- Whatcha doin'?
- Um, I'm putting these programmable lights

14:03.548 --> 14:05.935
on our dance costumes. See?

14:07.550 --> 14:08.858
What does that mean?

14:08.978 --> 14:10.428
- Programmable?
- Oh,

14:10.485 --> 14:14.122
Emma and I are writing code so the
lights change in time to the choreography.

14:14.624 --> 14:16.075
Writing code?

14:16.195 --> 14:17.890
It's how you tell computers what to do.

14:20.020 --> 14:21.390
You're so smart.

14:22.288 --> 14:23.898
I never even finished high school.

14:24.018 --> 14:25.183
Why?

14:25.303 --> 14:26.645
Why'd you drop out? What happened?

14:26.765 --> 14:28.894
I fell in with the wrong crowd, I guess.

14:29.014 --> 14:30.252
We got into drugs.

14:30.270 --> 14:33.145
You know, for most of my friends,
it was just fun, but for me,

14:33.265 --> 14:38.252
once I got started, once I knew
I could shut down all my feelings,

14:38.330 --> 14:39.605
there was no going back.

14:41.180 --> 14:43.250
Why did you want to
shut down your feelings?

14:44.072 --> 14:45.260
I don't know.

14:46.324 --> 14:48.832
My mother was really strict with me.

14:49.093 --> 14:52.779
I was the only girl with three
older brothers who could do no wrong.

14:53.363 --> 14:58.481
And I just felt like my mother gave them
everything they wanted and, me, not so much.

14:59.196 --> 15:01.882
So I rebelled, you know?

15:01.932 --> 15:04.669
I mean, I know now, she was hard on me

15:04.679 --> 15:06.314
because she thought she had to be.

15:07.278 --> 15:10.535
It's really hard being
a girl in this world.

15:12.075 --> 15:16.173
I'm really glad you've been raised
by two strong, independent women.

15:17.269 --> 15:21.353
I hope you know you can do
anything if you set your mind to it.

15:24.593 --> 15:25.727
What?

15:27.821 --> 15:29.421
The baby's kicking...

15:29.608 --> 15:30.608
hard.

15:31.042 --> 15:32.248
You want to feel?

15:40.973 --> 15:42.458
Oh...

15:42.578 --> 15:45.481
That's so cool. It's like you've
got a little alien in there.

15:45.495 --> 15:48.981
That's nothing. Think how it
felt with two aliens in there.

15:56.591 --> 15:59.021
Oh, Emma's here to help.

16:07.736 --> 16:11.729
Ow! Oh, my God! Ow!

16:11.765 --> 16:12.925
Jesus!

16:12.993 --> 16:14.644
- Not too fast.
- Yeah, slow down.

16:14.678 --> 16:16.411
- Let's get her onto the couch.
- Can you walk on it?

16:16.445 --> 16:17.659
I don't know.

16:19.280 --> 16:20.885
Be careful.

16:21.319 --> 16:24.686
How many times have Moms told you not
to leave your skateboard in the house?!

16:24.720 --> 16:26.198
Get her leg up.

16:26.257 --> 16:28.171
Oh, my God, without six dancers,

16:28.180 --> 16:29.305
we're gonna have to forfeit.

16:29.425 --> 16:31.113
Oh, no. I'm not letting Kaitlyn win.

16:31.118 --> 16:32.739
What're you gonna do? Pull
a dancer outta thin air?

16:37.533 --> 16:39.956
- Are you gonna get that?
- Oh, yeah, sorry.

16:44.048 --> 16:45.641
Jesus.

16:45.761 --> 16:48.576
Sorry to stop by unannounced...

16:48.884 --> 16:50.713
Is Ana in?

16:51.658 --> 16:54.792
Um, yeah. Come in.

17:05.669 --> 17:09.137
Sophia, your father tells me
you're getting rid of Quincy?

17:09.713 --> 17:11.107
What's that about?

17:12.156 --> 17:15.509
Uh, Sophia just has so many activities now.

17:16.502 --> 17:18.050
She loves to ride.

17:19.277 --> 17:22.051
What about all those ribbons
and the medals that you won?

17:22.172 --> 17:23.731
I'm sorry Papaw,

17:24.125 --> 17:25.712
I know you gave him to me,

17:25.758 --> 17:28.125
but I just feel bad cause I don't
ride him as much as I used to.

17:28.340 --> 17:31.089
He's going to a charity where
kids want to learn how to ride.

17:31.209 --> 17:32.975
He's gonna get a lot of love and attention.

17:33.201 --> 17:33.859
Yeah.

17:34.736 --> 17:35.931
I think that's great.

17:35.982 --> 17:38.500
Kids' interests change,
Robert, as they grow up.

17:38.934 --> 17:41.855
Thank goodness, or I'd be
sitting here in a macrame dress.

17:44.052 --> 17:48.038
Well, I just think it's interesting,
the timing of all these changes.

17:48.068 --> 17:51.122
- Dad...
- I'm just saying, I don't think it's a coincidence.

17:51.977 --> 17:53.871
And, Callie, I mean you no offense.

17:53.922 --> 17:55.555
I'm sure you're a lovely young lady.

17:56.337 --> 17:58.485
But imagine how Sophia must feel.

17:59.019 --> 18:00.732
Now you have another daughter,

18:00.911 --> 18:02.369
you're suddenly obsessed with.

18:03.575 --> 18:04.716
I'm not obsessed.

18:04.836 --> 18:06.567
You're trying to get custody, aren't you?

18:06.977 --> 18:08.560
As if Sophia wasn't enough.

18:08.585 --> 18:11.586
This has nothing to do with
how much we love Sophia.

18:11.615 --> 18:12.996
It's OK, Papaw.

18:14.147 --> 18:16.007
I love having a sister.

18:16.537 --> 18:18.591
Sweetheart you tried to kill yourself.

18:18.606 --> 18:19.607
Dad, enough.

18:20.236 --> 18:22.297
I love both my daughters.

18:22.417 --> 18:24.764
I wouldn't even be in
this position if you hadn't

18:24.800 --> 18:27.479
forced me to choose between
her mother and this family.

18:27.501 --> 18:28.644
Oh, here we go,

18:28.764 --> 18:31.049
we all know I ruined you life.

18:31.053 --> 18:32.266
That's not what I said.

18:33.388 --> 18:34.569
I love my wife.

18:34.594 --> 18:36.337
And God knows I've put you through so much.

18:36.341 --> 18:37.244
I don't deserve you.

18:39.742 --> 18:41.067
You didn't ruin my life, Dad.

18:41.096 --> 18:43.694
But do you have any idea
how hard Callie's has been?

18:43.711 --> 18:45.919
All the hell she's been through
because I wasn't there for her?

18:46.143 --> 18:49.386
- That's not my fault.
- No, it's not. It's mine.

18:49.592 --> 18:51.041
Because I didn't stand up to you.

18:51.108 --> 18:52.849
Is that what all this is about?

18:52.872 --> 18:54.932
You finally standing up to me.

18:55.052 --> 18:58.924
By forcing a young lady to come
live with you, against her will?

18:58.948 --> 19:01.818
- I'm not forcing...
- You can't turn back time, Robert.

19:02.174 --> 19:05.244
You've got regrets,
well, son, so do we all.

19:07.592 --> 19:10.118
This young lady is happy where she is.

19:10.995 --> 19:13.941
So why are you putting
her through more hell?

19:23.488 --> 19:25.383
You can't keep them apart forever, Adam.

19:25.503 --> 19:26.827
What about school?

19:26.947 --> 19:28.494
I'm pulling him from Anchor Beach.

19:29.212 --> 19:30.773
With just a few weeks
left in the school year?

19:30.794 --> 19:31.977
He'll have to repeat the grade.

19:33.356 --> 19:34.087
And then what?

19:34.599 --> 19:36.378
You lock him up until he's 18?

19:39.013 --> 19:39.662
Look...

19:40.384 --> 19:43.033
you can keep Jude outside
the door as long as you want,

19:43.050 --> 19:45.266
as long as you're willing to stand watch.

19:45.459 --> 19:46.319
But what then?

19:46.479 --> 19:48.279
You gonna keep all the
boys outside the door?

19:49.448 --> 19:52.097
Or you could try. But trust me, if you do,

19:52.750 --> 19:54.988
you'll be the one who
ends up getting shut out.

19:58.821 --> 20:01.013
I don't care that your son's gay.

20:07.244 --> 20:09.314
I just don't want mine to be.

20:46.878 --> 20:47.805
What's this?

20:48.765 --> 20:49.582
War paint.

21:06.396 --> 21:07.890
I thought that

21:08.210 --> 21:10.137
if my moms didn't take the baby,

21:10.841 --> 21:11.874
maybe they would.

21:14.080 --> 21:15.920
I'm sorry, I should have told you.

21:19.850 --> 21:21.257
So, is that why you're here?

21:22.115 --> 21:23.793
- You wanna take my baby?
- No.

21:25.264 --> 21:26.383
We're here...

21:28.690 --> 21:31.125
Because we want you to keep your baby.

21:31.463 --> 21:34.153
- We want to help you.
- Any way you want.

21:34.199 --> 21:37.227
You can come and stay with us,

21:37.693 --> 21:39.296
or... maybe...

21:39.416 --> 21:41.051
You should be with your family, Ana.

21:41.171 --> 21:42.544
So should your child.

22:01.011 --> 22:02.973
I can't.

22:08.499 --> 22:10.069
It's too late.

22:11.274 --> 22:13.557
Stef and Lena are taking her.

22:14.964 --> 22:17.276
I can't... I'm sorry...

22:18.982 --> 22:19.960
no.

22:31.536 --> 22:35.513
Wow, is it hard to get my
dad's wife to leave a party.

22:38.750 --> 22:41.108
I'm really sorry about
what my dad said earlier.

22:41.308 --> 22:44.985
- It's OK.
- No, it's... it's not.

22:45.105 --> 22:47.492
I thought he'd be on his best
behavior, especially today.

22:47.612 --> 22:50.461
- He adores Sophia.
- That's obvious.

22:51.306 --> 22:52.678
No, it's fine,

22:53.226 --> 22:54.174
honest,

22:55.168 --> 22:56.692
families are weird.

22:56.744 --> 22:58.754
All of them.

23:00.450 --> 23:03.030
I guess you really don't wanna
be a part of this one now, huh?

23:05.845 --> 23:09.608
But I am... part of you and Sophia.

23:10.744 --> 23:12.474
I don't wanna fight that anymore.

23:12.891 --> 23:15.654
And for the record, I'm mad at my mom.

23:16.290 --> 23:18.008
That she lied to both of us.

23:18.780 --> 23:21.475
Yeah, well, she was just doing
what she thought was best for you.

23:21.658 --> 23:23.001
Yeah, but it wasn't.

23:24.792 --> 23:26.257
I'm just sayin'...

23:27.778 --> 23:30.528
you aren't the only one that made mistakes,

23:30.884 --> 23:32.725
so don't blame yourself.

23:33.087 --> 23:36.060
If you knew about me, you
woulda taken care of me.

23:36.261 --> 23:37.449
And Jude.

23:38.216 --> 23:39.463
I know that.

23:43.072 --> 23:44.977
And it's not that I don't love you.

23:45.584 --> 23:46.388
I do.

23:50.884 --> 23:53.043
It's just the Fosters,

23:53.088 --> 23:55.331
they're home, and they feel like home.

23:56.998 --> 23:58.579
No matter what, just know that

23:58.905 --> 24:01.366
I want you to be a part of my life.

24:03.839 --> 24:04.941
To be my dad.

24:08.772 --> 24:12.307
Whatever happens, you can trust
me, just know that... honest.

24:12.964 --> 24:14.151
I know.

24:15.111 --> 24:16.173
I do.

24:24.070 --> 24:26.566
Oh, Robert, sorry. Um,

24:26.845 --> 24:28.164
you have a call.

24:30.111 --> 24:31.513
It's your lawyer.

24:33.869 --> 24:36.325
Oh, well, that was

24:36.764 --> 24:38.574
quite an afternoon, wasn't it?

24:41.309 --> 24:42.255
Yeah...

24:42.949 --> 24:46.699
I just hope you know that
everything that Robert does,

24:46.819 --> 24:48.906
he does out of love for you.

24:49.636 --> 24:51.466
I do. I do know that.

24:55.968 --> 24:57.603
You're trying to get emancipated?

25:04.705 --> 25:06.989
Well, hope to see you
in the fall, young man.

25:07.109 --> 25:08.889
- See ya.
- Thank you.

25:09.808 --> 25:10.936
So, can I go?

25:11.526 --> 25:13.189
Let us talk about it, but...

25:13.212 --> 25:15.035
But he was very persuasive.

25:15.060 --> 25:17.029
- Yes!
- Go do your homework.

25:22.087 --> 25:23.443
How can we say no?

25:39.668 --> 25:42.488
- What are you doing home, love?
- Is everything OK?

25:43.104 --> 25:45.878
Robert found out about the emancipation.

25:47.637 --> 25:50.881
- OK, what did he say?
- Nothing. He just brought me home.

25:51.001 --> 25:52.361
This is exactly what I was afraid of.

25:52.374 --> 25:53.740
What do you think he's gonna do?

25:53.804 --> 25:55.243
There's nothing he can do.

25:56.171 --> 25:58.331
It's gonna be OK. Go
inside. We'll be right in.

26:03.594 --> 26:05.024
Nothing he can do?

26:05.504 --> 26:06.604
Didn't want to scare her.

26:06.605 --> 26:08.743
- She's already...
- Shh, please.

26:08.798 --> 26:10.187
She's already scared.

26:10.365 --> 26:11.813
If Robert goes to the judge with this,

26:11.845 --> 26:14.311
there's no question who's
gonna get custody of Callie.

26:15.590 --> 26:17.307
It's...

26:21.206 --> 26:22.987
Come in.

26:25.653 --> 26:27.384
Just wondered if you needed anything?

26:27.686 --> 26:29.661
No, I'm good, thank you.

26:32.848 --> 26:34.624
Jesus.

26:36.676 --> 26:39.352
Are you serious about going
to this boarding school?

26:39.609 --> 26:41.534
I think so. Why?

26:41.825 --> 26:43.310
I don't know, I just...

26:43.430 --> 26:45.851
... you have such a
wonderful family and home.

26:45.914 --> 26:49.750
And I just wish I hadn't left
mine when I was 15. That's all.

26:50.401 --> 26:51.480
Sorry.

26:53.426 --> 26:54.357
That's OK.

26:54.945 --> 26:56.287
Well, night.

26:56.584 --> 26:57.846
Good night.

27:03.185 --> 27:06.285
- What're you doing?
- Oh, Callie's home

27:06.308 --> 27:08.572
- and we have to pull an all-nighter.
- Can I talk to you?

27:10.616 --> 27:12.654
I'll be downstairs.

27:15.236 --> 27:16.812
I think Ana wants to keep the baby.

27:16.834 --> 27:19.507
But I think the only reason
she isn't is because of you.

27:19.834 --> 27:22.181
- What am I supposed to do?
- Tell her it's OK.

27:22.301 --> 27:24.200
- And what about our moms?
- They'll understand.

27:24.219 --> 27:26.301
They're doing this for you. Everyone is.

27:28.352 --> 27:30.266
You know what, I can't
deal with this right now.

27:30.449 --> 27:33.591
Thanks to you, I've got one day to
pull this dance-off outta my ass.

27:33.893 --> 27:35.423
You can barely walk.

27:35.543 --> 27:37.191
You're not gonna be able to dance.

27:37.223 --> 27:38.588
Oh, we'll see about that.

27:42.402 --> 27:43.562
Ow...

27:44.321 --> 27:46.440
ow... ow.

27:51.381 --> 27:54.147
I like it. It's subtle.

27:55.378 --> 27:56.520
Hey.

27:59.697 --> 28:00.804
Got a minute?

28:01.415 --> 28:05.771
Uh, no, not really, but
good to know you're alive.

28:05.823 --> 28:07.125
Sorry.

28:07.445 --> 28:08.969
I was sulking.

28:10.094 --> 28:12.261
OK. But I really do have somewhere to be.

28:12.302 --> 28:14.860
I got a call from this A&R guy

28:15.121 --> 28:16.057
a friend knows,

28:16.541 --> 28:17.807
he's at a legit label.

28:17.831 --> 28:19.472
He heard that demo we
sent out to the clubs,

28:19.504 --> 28:21.511
and he wants to come
to one of our L.A. gigs.

28:21.916 --> 28:23.572
He really likes the sound.

28:25.928 --> 28:27.368
It's kind of a big deal.

28:27.529 --> 28:28.252
So...

28:29.856 --> 28:30.831
you know, you can

28:30.951 --> 28:33.126
go to this program for a summer

28:33.192 --> 28:34.654
and have fun or whatever...

28:34.712 --> 28:36.953
Or you could come on tour,

28:37.702 --> 28:38.740
who knows what could happen.

28:40.328 --> 28:41.637
We're good together.

28:43.346 --> 28:44.631
I love you.

28:48.580 --> 28:50.481
Come on tour with me.

28:57.977 --> 29:01.293
He, uh... He had to
loan the car to his moms.

29:02.651 --> 29:04.449
- One of them.
- Mmm.

29:06.294 --> 29:08.903
I offered to pick him up but he...

29:09.503 --> 29:11.435
We don't we just try him again?

29:16.145 --> 29:18.846
Oh, hey. I was just about
to leave for St. Tristan's.

29:18.875 --> 29:22.045
We can drive together if you don't
mind riding in my son's beat-up Volvo.

29:22.109 --> 29:23.635
My car's in the shop.

29:26.219 --> 29:26.854
Uh-oh.

29:26.895 --> 29:29.720
I, uh, heard from the Kilfer Foundation...

29:36.767 --> 29:38.288
We got the grant!

29:40.576 --> 29:43.938
Oh, my God!

29:44.563 --> 29:46.381
I'm so excited.

29:46.747 --> 29:51.927
So the last count of eight
is: chug, chug, down, out,

29:51.968 --> 29:54.545
cross and up...

29:54.787 --> 29:57.021
- Ow.
- Now that's a move I haven't seen before.

29:57.072 --> 29:58.648
Looks like the rumors are true.

29:58.889 --> 30:00.502
I just wanted to say, break a leg.

30:00.955 --> 30:02.997
Oops, looks like you already did.

30:08.587 --> 30:10.108
Everything's set in the back.

30:12.127 --> 30:13.895
I hope to hell you can pull this off.

30:13.963 --> 30:16.841
Because if she wins there is no God.

30:18.791 --> 30:20.386
Careful, we don't wanna show up drunk.

30:22.104 --> 30:24.103
Yeah, that would be quite the scandal.

30:31.553 --> 30:32.412
What?

30:33.111 --> 30:34.783
Ana's gonna be there.

30:36.222 --> 30:37.541
Mariana invited her.

30:37.661 --> 30:39.215
Oh...

30:39.438 --> 30:41.037
How do you feel about that?

30:41.910 --> 30:42.924
Fine...

30:43.867 --> 30:44.888
Fine?

30:45.413 --> 30:47.547
Really?

30:50.941 --> 30:52.006
No.

30:52.810 --> 30:55.468
No, not fine. Um...

30:56.994 --> 30:59.017
nothing's fine right now.

30:59.883 --> 31:00.954
Tell me.

31:01.201 --> 31:03.289
I just feel really awful saying this.

31:05.916 --> 31:08.515
I'm just not excited about this baby.

31:09.999 --> 31:12.310
Not like I was about Frankie, you know.

31:12.430 --> 31:14.041
I mean, I know I'm going to love her,

31:14.461 --> 31:18.005
but right now, all I feel is overwhelmed...

31:20.673 --> 31:23.231
... and worried. About everything.

31:25.287 --> 31:27.509
Including my marriage.

31:28.365 --> 31:30.311
Oh, it's OK.

31:42.170 --> 31:45.303
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't be.

31:59.166 --> 32:00.998
- I should...
- ... Go.

32:02.812 --> 32:04.416
Uh, yeah. I'll see you there...

32:11.820 --> 32:13.476
Mama better get here soon.

32:17.004 --> 32:20.678
Have you heard anything
about Connor? How he's doing?

32:21.470 --> 32:22.425
I saw him.

32:23.482 --> 32:24.539
He's good.

32:25.035 --> 32:28.247
- You saw him? I thought...
- He's my boyfriend.

32:31.341 --> 32:32.882
Oh, here she is.

32:33.184 --> 32:35.359
Right here, honey.

32:36.422 --> 32:37.780
Afraid you weren't gonna make it.

32:37.814 --> 32:40.292
Yeah, I got hung up at the office.

32:46.183 --> 32:48.407
All right, everybody, let's get started.

32:48.473 --> 32:50.461
First up: team one.

32:59.676 --> 33:01.773
They stole our dystopian robot theme.

34:19.849 --> 34:22.121
Up next, team two.

34:26.114 --> 34:29.333
I knew it, she's not dancing,
they only have five, so we win.

34:29.454 --> 34:33.176
Wait, is that like a digital dancer?

34:33.295 --> 34:35.744
But, how did she do that?

34:35.763 --> 34:38.067
With her computer?

34:38.187 --> 34:41.685
Is that like a projection?
They can't have a fake dancer.

34:41.804 --> 34:43.033
Can they?

34:49.717 --> 34:51.842
That looks so real, right?

35:34.044 --> 35:36.639
I can't believe she did
all this with a computer!

35:36.759 --> 35:39.208
Our daughter is a genius!

36:38.984 --> 36:39.830
Hey. What's up?

36:39.860 --> 36:41.794
Judge Ringer's office called.

36:41.824 --> 36:44.694
He wants to see you two
and Callie in his chambers.

36:45.510 --> 36:48.241
- How soon?
- How soon can you get there?

36:56.730 --> 37:00.839
I... I'm sorry. I have other appointments.

37:00.869 --> 37:02.356
I'm not going to be able to wait.

37:02.392 --> 37:05.136
Something must have
happened. Can we reschedule?

37:05.256 --> 37:06.828
I'm afraid not.

37:08.078 --> 37:09.782
Hey, I'm sorry.

37:09.812 --> 37:13.047
I missed the bus on the way over
here and I forgot my phone at home.

37:13.076 --> 37:15.667
I... I had to run half the way over here.

37:20.926 --> 37:22.715
Thanks for driving us home.

37:22.739 --> 37:25.881
Oh, it's fine, I'm sorry your
moms couldn't stay to celebrate.

37:25.955 --> 37:27.904
- We will tonight.
- You're welcome, by the way.

37:28.024 --> 37:28.830
For what?

37:28.859 --> 37:30.481
If you hadn't tripped over my skateboard,

37:30.655 --> 37:32.075
you would have never come up with all that.

37:33.249 --> 37:36.222
How did you make that
dancer that wasn't there?

37:36.399 --> 37:37.829
Oh, we um...

37:37.879 --> 37:40.722
we used the motion sensors
from the video game console,

37:40.764 --> 37:44.120
and then we hacked it so we could record
Emma doing the choreography in front of it,

37:44.360 --> 37:48.378
and then we just applied that to one of the
avatars we made to look like one of the dancers.

37:48.683 --> 37:51.688
I have no idea what you just said.

37:52.045 --> 37:53.712
I hope the baby is smart like you.

38:00.335 --> 38:03.876
Have you thought about keeping the baby?

38:04.658 --> 38:08.181
I mean, if you want to, I think you should.

38:13.719 --> 38:15.305
What's wrong?

38:20.243 --> 38:21.959
I'm sorry, I just...

38:22.211 --> 38:23.590
I need a second.

38:23.710 --> 38:27.997
- Is something wrong?
- I just... I got a sharp pain.

38:28.020 --> 38:29.669
- Like labor?
- I don't think so.

38:29.717 --> 38:32.291
That's usually more cramp-like.

38:32.356 --> 38:35.385
OK, um, should we...

38:35.403 --> 38:37.675
- I think we should go to the hospital.
- How? She can't drive.

38:37.693 --> 38:39.236
- Fine. I'll drive.
- Why do you get to drive?

38:39.255 --> 38:41.011
For one thing, I'm a way
better driver than you.

38:41.026 --> 38:43.040
- You had to take the test twice.
- Because it was too easy.

38:43.053 --> 38:44.217
Yeah, that's why people fail tests,

38:44.233 --> 38:45.405
because they're too easy.

38:45.432 --> 38:47.236
And besides, you have a hurt ankle.

38:47.242 --> 38:48.827
- That's not my driving leg!
- You know what... ?

38:49.079 --> 38:49.883
Um...

38:51.708 --> 38:54.059
I think it passed.

38:54.504 --> 38:57.121
I'm fine. I... Yeah, I can drive.

38:57.123 --> 38:59.780
Let's, um... Let's get you home...

38:59.997 --> 39:01.863
I still think that we
should go to the hospital.

39:01.886 --> 39:03.689
Sacred Cross is only
a few blocks from here.

39:04.872 --> 39:06.434
Yeah, OK.

39:10.789 --> 39:13.233
So, I understand you've been
trying to get Callie emancipated.

39:14.718 --> 39:19.196
Your Honor, we just, we feel like
Callie deserves a choice in this and...

39:19.196 --> 39:20.329
They're right.

39:22.132 --> 39:23.262
They're right.

39:24.334 --> 39:25.643
So, uh...

39:28.847 --> 39:30.273
I signed them.

39:36.939 --> 39:38.903
Look, I don't want you to get emancipated.

39:40.565 --> 39:42.351
And I don't wanna be my father.

39:43.913 --> 39:45.430
But I...

39:46.747 --> 39:48.415
I believe what you said.

39:48.959 --> 39:50.457
That I'm your dad.

39:51.502 --> 39:53.062
No matter what.

40:04.308 --> 40:06.360
I am... officially

40:06.775 --> 40:09.078
withdrawing my suit for custody.

40:28.688 --> 40:30.685
- Whoo.
- Are you OK?

40:30.715 --> 40:32.679
Ooh, I think the baby's coming.

40:33.060 --> 40:36.492
OK, OK, the hospital is just a couple
blocks from here. Can you make it?

40:36.758 --> 40:40.262
We are gonna celebrate so
big when I get home tonight!

40:40.316 --> 40:43.247
Maybe we should wait until
I'm officially adopted?

40:43.263 --> 40:46.523
- I don't want to jinx anything.
- Nothing's gonna stop us now, Callie.

40:48.986 --> 40:51.425
Just keep breathing, we're
almost there. You can do this.

41:05.076 --> 41:08.414
All right, I'll get
home... as soon as I can.

41:08.483 --> 41:10.286
- See you when I get home.
- Love you.

41:11.307 --> 41:12.526
- All right.
- Bye.

41:12.807 --> 41:15.393
We got a two-car *** on Mission and E.

41:15.394 --> 41:18.670
One reported fatality.
Repeat: one reported fatality.

41:18.690 --> 41:20.034
Requesting medical and backup.

41:20.043 --> 41:23.098
Officer Adams-Fosters. I'm
right near them. I'm on my way.
