NEWSCASTER:
And we're back with our coverage

00:37.138 --> 00:38.971
of the Quahog
Thanksgiving Day Parade.

00:38.973 --> 00:40.039
Happy Turkey Day, Quahog.

00:40.041 --> 00:42.107
This is Tom Tucker
and Joyce Kinney

00:42.109 --> 00:45.277
We've got some on-and-off
drizzle here today,

00:45.279 --> 00:46.945
and we're a little wet,
as you can see,

00:46.947 --> 00:50.182
because, apparently, there are
no awnings that exist anywhere.

00:50.184 --> 00:52.151
There's your top news
story right there.

00:52.153 --> 00:54.920
Mysterious awning
shortage ravages the Northeast,

00:54.922 --> 00:58.223
but miraculously has not
affected Channels 2 or 6.

00:59.926 --> 01:01.927
No no. Keep the camera
over there.

01:01.929 --> 01:02.928
I want everyone to see it.

01:02.930 --> 01:04.997
This is why we're third.

01:04.999 --> 01:07.433
And here comes our first
float of the day, Tom.

01:07.435 --> 01:09.802
It's the James Woods
High football team

01:09.804 --> 01:11.437
with their
"Not Gay Revue."

01:11.439 --> 01:12.838

(car alarm blaring)
And here comes the Rocky
and Bullwinkle float.

01:28.089 --> 01:30.689
Always a popular sight
here at the par...

01:30.691 --> 01:32.524
S-Somebody want
to handle that?

01:32.526 --> 01:33.759
Does some--
does some--

01:33.761 --> 01:35.527
Does somebody want
to deal with that?

01:35.529 --> 01:37.763
The car alarm,
"what."

01:37.765 --> 01:38.764
You're kidding.

01:38.766 --> 01:39.932
Well, viewers,
to top it off,

01:39.934 --> 01:42.334
that's the Channel 5
news van you're hearing.

01:42.336 --> 01:45.170
Ph-Phil, Phil just open it--
unlock the doors.

01:45.172 --> 01:47.539
You don't have to put
the key in the ignition.

01:47.541 --> 01:49.708
Well, open the
driver's side first.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.710
Okay, well, I guess
it's broken, then,

01:51.712 --> 01:52.945
and there's nothing
we can do about it.

01:52.947 --> 01:54.346
Okay, happy Thanksgiving,
Quahog.

01:54.348 --> 01:55.347
Here's a car alarm.

01:55.349 --> 01:56.782
(alarm continues blaring)
(sighs)

01:56.784 --> 01:57.916
All right, well,
I guess we'll just...

01:57.918 --> 01:59.518
(alarm stops with a tweet)
Ahhh, there we go.

01:59.520 --> 02:00.519
(doorbell rings)

02:00.521 --> 02:01.920
Oh, that must be
Joe and Bonnie.

02:01.922 --> 02:03.922
Now remember everyone,
let's be cheerful,

02:03.924 --> 02:06.024
'cause Thanksgivings
are very hard for them.

02:06.026 --> 02:07.659
'Cause Joe can't walk?
No.

02:07.661 --> 02:10.129
'Cause his bum doesn't
open up to poo anymore,

02:10.131 --> 02:12.131
and a nurse has to
go digging up there

02:12.133 --> 02:13.699
to get up after
his stuff?

02:13.701 --> 02:14.700
(laughs)

02:14.702 --> 02:15.701
Oh, my God!

02:15.703 --> 02:16.768
(laughs)
I know.

02:16.770 --> 02:18.337
That was told to me
in confidence.

02:18.339 --> 02:19.938
No. Don't you
remember, Peter?

02:19.940 --> 02:21.340
It was
on Thanksgiving

02:21.342 --> 02:23.275
that their son Kevin
got killed in Iraq.

02:24.210 --> 02:25.644
Look who's here!

02:25.646 --> 02:27.146
Happy Thanksgiving.

02:27.148 --> 02:30.482
You guys, thanks so much
for having us over.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.985
Well, we're just glad we
can have people over again

02:32.987 --> 02:34.520
now that that giant
crab's gone.

02:34.522 --> 02:36.688
Hey, guys,
how ya doin'?
Come on in.

02:36.690 --> 02:38.524
(rapid staccato):
No-no-no-no-no-no-no.

02:38.526 --> 02:39.958
No-no-no-no-no,
no-no-no-no-no.

02:39.960 --> 02:40.993
Just go around it.

02:40.995 --> 02:41.960
He's not gonna
hurt ya.

02:41.962 --> 02:43.028
Just go around it.

02:43.030 --> 02:44.029
No-no-no-no-no-no-no.

02:44.031 --> 02:45.030
No-no-no-no-no,
no-no-no-no-no.

02:45.032 --> 02:46.031
No-no-no-no-no.

02:46.033 --> 02:47.666
All right, try just
going under him.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.168
I think we should
probably just go home.

02:49.170 --> 02:50.602
Maybe we'll do it
another time.

02:50.604 --> 02:51.670
No-no-no-no-no.

02:58.545 --> 02:59.545
What the hell?

02:59.547 --> 03:00.546
Mom!

03:00.548 --> 03:01.780
Mom, it's me! Mom!

03:01.782 --> 03:03.448
Oh, yeah, it's a baby.

03:03.450 --> 03:04.983
It's a big balloon, baby,

03:04.985 --> 03:06.418
just like you're a baby.

03:06.420 --> 03:07.419
No, it's me!

03:07.421 --> 03:08.420
It's a balloon of me!

03:08.422 --> 03:09.821
Peter, come
look at this.

03:09.823 --> 03:12.324
He sees a baby and knows
that he's also a baby.

03:12.326 --> 03:13.625
So smart.

03:13.627 --> 03:15.294
Mama's smart little boy.

03:15.296 --> 03:16.929
Aah, check out Quagmire.

03:16.931 --> 03:18.330
It's been a year and a half,

03:18.332 --> 03:20.766
and he still looks
uncomfortable around his dad.

03:20.768 --> 03:22.334
Well, it's a
big adjustment.

03:22.336 --> 03:25.437
After all, his dad did have
a sex-change operation.

03:25.439 --> 03:27.940
So, uh...
how-how are things, Dad?

03:27.942 --> 03:31.276
Oh, Glenn, I can't tell you how
wonderful it is to be back here.

03:31.278 --> 03:33.812
This is gonna be a really
special Thanksgiving.

03:33.814 --> 03:35.647
Happy Thanksgiving!

03:35.649 --> 03:37.115
We brought
chicken wings.

03:37.117 --> 03:40.052
Oh, yum. I hope they're the
kind with the bone removed.

03:41.521 --> 03:42.921
(doorbell rings)

03:43.923 --> 03:44.923
Hey, Aunt Carol.

03:44.925 --> 03:45.924
Hey, Uncle Adam.

03:45.926 --> 03:47.326
♪ La la la la la.

03:47.328 --> 03:49.761
Don't mention last night's
<i>Project Runway.</i>

03:49.763 --> 03:51.129
I've got it on TiVo.

03:51.131 --> 03:52.531
Happy Thanksgiving.

03:52.533 --> 03:54.132
I brought Marshmallow Peeps.

03:54.134 --> 03:55.133
Oh.

03:55.135 --> 03:56.335
Okay.

03:56.337 --> 03:58.670
I'm gonna need
that Pyrex dish back.

03:58.672 --> 03:59.972
Okay.

03:59.974 --> 04:02.040
I'm gonna need it back now.

04:02.042 --> 04:03.275
Oh.

04:04.444 --> 04:05.944
I don't want
anything else today

04:05.946 --> 04:07.946
to get as tense
as that just got.

04:07.948 --> 04:10.115
Carol, it's so good
to see you.

04:10.117 --> 04:11.049
You, too, Lois.

04:11.051 --> 04:12.851
God, that is
one nice ass.

04:12.853 --> 04:14.286
Thank you.
You're welcome.

04:14.288 --> 04:16.088
(TV playing)

04:16.090 --> 04:17.289
This is nice.

04:17.291 --> 04:18.924
This is very nice,

04:18.926 --> 04:21.026
the time that
together right now.

04:21.028 --> 04:22.027
Easy, Joe.

04:22.029 --> 04:23.095
(groans)

04:23.097 --> 04:25.097
Sorry.
Just making mental memories

04:25.099 --> 04:27.199
for when you're all
inevitably dead,

04:27.201 --> 04:28.500
and I'm left alone.

04:28.502 --> 04:30.335
Geez. Quagmire, help me out
with this.

04:30.337 --> 04:31.970
No, he's right.
I mean, sometimes

04:31.972 --> 04:33.872
chicks die, and it's
not anyone's fault.

04:33.874 --> 04:36.842
Okay, everyone, it's 2:30.
Time for dinner.

04:36.844 --> 04:40.512
'Cause on Thanksgiving, 2:30
is dinnertime for some reason.

04:43.850 --> 04:45.050
Oh, my.

04:45.052 --> 04:47.185
Lois, those sweet potatoes
look delicious.

04:47.187 --> 04:48.787
That's the
stuffing, Ma.

04:48.789 --> 04:51.690
Now put on your glasses before
you run over another black guy.

04:51.692 --> 04:53.292
Oh, this looks fantastic.

04:53.294 --> 04:55.294
I can't wait to poop this out.

04:55.296 --> 04:56.528
Hey! Who's gonna get

04:56.530 --> 04:58.764
the Thanksgiving dump trophy
this year?

04:58.766 --> 05:00.532
You are!
Dad's gonna get it!

05:00.534 --> 05:01.533
Who else?

05:01.535 --> 05:02.534
(all laughing)

05:02.536 --> 05:04.336
Loving.
Loving family.

05:04.338 --> 05:06.538
Well, dig in, everyone!

05:10.343 --> 05:11.977
Hello, Ida.
Hello, Brian.

05:11.979 --> 05:14.046
How have you been?
Very well, thank you.

05:14.048 --> 05:17.115
He threw up
when he found out
you were a monster.

05:17.117 --> 05:19.418
This food is so (bleep) good,
Lois.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.687
Oh. Okay.
Wow.

05:21.689 --> 05:24.089
MAN:
Hey! Is there room at that table
for one more?

05:24.091 --> 05:25.991
(all gasp)

05:27.927 --> 05:29.294
Oh, my God!

05:29.296 --> 05:30.996
Kevin Swanson!

05:30.998 --> 05:32.764
Son, you're alive!

05:32.766 --> 05:35.701
Aw, and I stayed up all night
writing dead kid jokes.

05:35.703 --> 05:37.469
All right, you know what,
I'm gonna do one anyway.

05:37.471 --> 05:38.704
Kevin, go back outside.

05:38.706 --> 05:40.172
Everybody pretend
this didn't happen.

05:40.174 --> 05:44.109
Hey, Joe, what's your favorite
preparation of a tomato?

05:44.111 --> 05:46.945
Is it son-died tomato?

05:47.880 --> 05:50.682
Is it son-died tomato?

05:50.684 --> 05:52.351
Okay, Kevin, you
can come back in.

05:52.353 --> 05:53.752
Welcome home, soldier.

05:53.754 --> 05:54.753
(chuckles)

05:54.755 --> 05:56.355
Son-died tomato.

05:56.357 --> 05:57.322
(slide whistle squeaks)

06:03.463 --> 06:05.130
Kevin, you're alive!

06:05.132 --> 06:05.997
I don't believe it.

06:05.999 --> 06:07.966
Oh, my God, it's a miracle!

06:07.968 --> 06:09.868
Well, I guess
you replaced real butter

06:09.870 --> 06:11.136
as the star of the dinner.

06:11.138 --> 06:12.671
But I don't understand.

06:12.673 --> 06:14.473
The Army said you'd
been killed in action.

06:14.475 --> 06:15.474
What happened?

06:15.476 --> 06:18.009
Well, it's quite a story.

06:18.011 --> 06:21.780
In some ways, Army life in Iraq
<i>is what you'd expect,</i>

06:21.782 --> 06:23.215
<i>what with the blistering heat,</i>

06:23.217 --> 06:25.117
<i>the constant sense</i>
<i>of impending danger,</i>

06:25.119 --> 06:26.952
<i>and the one gay soldier</i>

06:26.954 --> 06:28.620
<i>awkwardly avoiding</i>
<i>the use of pronouns.</i>

06:28.622 --> 06:31.123
Man, I sure miss my
sweetheart back home.

06:31.125 --> 06:33.258
I can't wait to get
back to that person.

06:33.260 --> 06:34.960
Chow time, boys.

06:34.962 --> 06:36.795
Yes, sir, Sergeant
Major General Captain!

06:36.797 --> 06:38.597
Ah, come on, boys,
it's Thanksgiving.

06:38.599 --> 06:40.499
Call me Major
General Captain.

06:40.501 --> 06:42.000
Now you eat up.

06:43.002 --> 06:46.138
I don't trust that turkey
those Iraqis made.

06:46.140 --> 06:47.639
Ah, you're all wet, Swanson.

06:47.641 --> 06:48.640
I call the white meat.

06:48.642 --> 06:50.008
I call the dark meat.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.610
I call the cell phone
duct-taped to the side!

06:51.612 --> 06:52.677
Noooooo!

06:56.149 --> 06:58.350
They're all dead, sir,
except for Swanson.

06:58.352 --> 07:00.752
He's in a coma, but he's
unlikely to recover.

07:00.754 --> 07:03.522
Okay, well, just send Swanson's
parents a letter saying

07:03.524 --> 07:05.791
that he's dead, 'cause
those are already printed.

07:05.793 --> 07:07.292
You know what? Send one
to my parents, too.

07:07.294 --> 07:10.295
I spent five years in a
Kuwait military hospital.

07:10.297 --> 07:12.297
I woke up from
the coma last week,

07:12.299 --> 07:13.698
and I flew straight here.

07:13.700 --> 07:15.300
Kind of a
Thanksgiving surprise.

07:15.302 --> 07:18.203
Hey, when you get sexually
abused while you're in a coma,

07:18.205 --> 07:19.805
do you know
it's happening

07:19.807 --> 07:21.106
and just can't do
anything about it?

07:21.108 --> 07:23.008
Or do you not even
know what's going on?

07:23.010 --> 07:24.643
I also am curious about that.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.278
Hey, Kevin, you know
I put a yellow ribbon

07:26.280 --> 07:27.612
on my car for you guys?

07:27.614 --> 07:30.348
And-and a little thing that says
"I support the troops."

07:30.350 --> 07:32.984
'Cause there's nothing
I wouldn't do for you guys.

07:32.986 --> 07:35.120
but I don't have
any change on me right now.

07:35.122 --> 07:37.923
Well, all that matters
is that my boy is home.

07:37.925 --> 07:41.026
Kevin, I want you to meet
your little sister, Susie.

07:41.028 --> 07:42.027
Wow.

07:42.029 --> 07:43.094
Hey, little sis.

07:43.096 --> 07:44.996
I guess we got
some catching up to do, huh?

07:44.998 --> 07:45.964
Hope you
don't get scared

07:45.966 --> 07:47.799
when I scream and
have night terrors.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.100
SUSIE: (à la Patrick Stewart):
<i>It's quite all right.</i>

07:49.102 --> 07:50.035
I've seen worse.

07:50.037 --> 07:51.303
(horror movie score plays)

07:51.305 --> 07:52.804
(woman screams on TV)

07:52.806 --> 07:54.673
SUSIE: (à la Patrick Stewart):
<i>A human centipede.</i>

07:54.675 --> 07:56.107
<i>How ghastly.</i>

07:56.109 --> 07:58.510
Your mother and I are
very proud of you, Kevin.

07:58.512 --> 07:59.945
You're a war hero.

07:59.947 --> 08:01.513
I don't feel
like a war hero.

08:01.515 --> 08:03.148
Only a war hero
would say that.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.984
Hey, so what about the female
soldiers over there?

08:05.986 --> 08:06.985
Were they able to contribute?

08:06.987 --> 08:08.753
Eh, you know,
they did their be.

08:08.755 --> 08:10.155
What with their
regular bleedings

08:10.157 --> 08:11.957
when they got shot,
did they even know?

08:11.959 --> 08:13.859
Look, guy,
I'm not a h.

08:13.861 --> 08:15.927
And I don't want to be treated
any different than before.

08:15.929 --> 08:17.028
Just that you would say that

08:17.030 --> 08:18.864
means we should treat you
different.

08:18.866 --> 08:22.434
Come on, guys, let's give him
all our best food.

08:22.436 --> 08:24.803
Okay, now you eat up, and then
we're all gonna go out back

08:24.805 --> 08:27.606
and play some Thanksgiving touch
football-- excuse me:

08:27.608 --> 08:30.509
war hero Thanksgiving
touch football.

08:35.715 --> 08:37.148
Yeaaaaah!

08:37.150 --> 08:38.116
U.S.A.!

08:38.118 --> 08:39.751
I didn't even know
there was a war.

08:41.921 --> 08:43.455
Okay, let's pick teams.

08:43.457 --> 08:44.656
I'll be a captain,

08:44.658 --> 08:46.992
and, uh, Mayor West,
you can be a captain.

08:46.994 --> 08:48.693
All rig.
I pick <i>.</i>

08:48.695 --> 08:50.996
You can't pick me;
I'm a captain.

08:50.998 --> 08:53.965
No one had ever stood up to me
like that before.

08:53.967 --> 08:56.201
I respected him
from there on out.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.936
That's a great
story, Grandpa.

08:57.938 --> 08:59.304
I didn't like it.

08:59.306 --> 09:00.705
None of my grandchildren

09:00.707 --> 09:03.775
had ever disliked one
of my stories before.

09:03.777 --> 09:06.311
From then on,
he was my favorite.

09:06.313 --> 09:08.346
Well, I don't like that
story, Great Grandpa.

09:08.348 --> 09:09.781
(crackling)

09:09.783 --> 09:12.384
Future old people
are wizards.

09:12.386 --> 09:14.152
(slurred):
Okay, so here's the game:

09:14.154 --> 09:15.487
I'm... I'm drunk,

09:15.489 --> 09:18.924
and I'm gonna throw the football
too hard at my kids.

09:18.926 --> 09:20.358
Oh, Dad, do we have to--
Ow!

09:20.360 --> 09:22.494
Don't cry!
Don't cry!

09:22.496 --> 09:24.129
Game's over if you cry.

09:24.131 --> 09:26.998
I want you to learn
about life, Chris,

09:27.000 --> 09:29.401
'cause of, in life
it's like this.

09:30.536 --> 09:32.804
Peter, I think you may
have had one too many.

09:32.806 --> 09:34.639
Maybe it's time
to ease off, huh?

09:34.641 --> 09:36.041
What are you talkg
about, Lois?

09:36.043 --> 09:37.776
Dads getting drunk
on Thanksgiving

09:37.778 --> 09:38.977
is a holiday tradition.

09:38.979 --> 09:42.147
(slurring): I work hard to put
a cornucopia on this table,

09:42.149 --> 09:44.282
and you're out
showing your lower ankle

09:44.284 --> 09:47.552
to every Tom, Tom, and
other Tom in our village!

09:47.554 --> 09:49.521
Don't talk to mother
in like fashion!

09:49.523 --> 09:52.190
That's it.
The belt is coming off.

09:55.995 --> 09:56.962
All right, son.

09:56.964 --> 09:59.164
Let's put these bozos
in a hurt locker.

09:59.166 --> 10:01.266
Right? 'Cause, uh,
"hurt locker" means

10:01.268 --> 10:02.934
some kind of war hero
thing, or something.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.803
Pfft. My friends
and I used to laugh

10:04.805 --> 10:06.271
about how fake
that movie is.

10:06.273 --> 10:07.272
But...

10:07.274 --> 10:08.673
Well, wait, I, uh...

10:08.675 --> 10:10.842
I'm pretty sure
that movie came out

10:10.844 --> 10:12.510
after you went
into your coma.

10:12.512 --> 10:14.946
Right-- no, no, uh, I-I-I was
talking about a different movie.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.014
Let's play ball!

10:16.016 --> 10:19.017
Yeah, let's play ball.

10:19.019 --> 10:21.052
(ball pinging off someone's
skin, howls of pain)

10:21.054 --> 10:23.021
PETER (slurred):
The world has changed around me,

10:23.023 --> 10:24.656
and I'm mad and scared!

10:28.461 --> 10:31.196
Lois, this pumpkin pie
looks delightful.

10:31.198 --> 10:33.198
Hey, Kevin, can I see
your Purple Heart?

10:33.200 --> 10:34.833
'Cause I never
actually seen one.

10:34.835 --> 10:37.435
One-one time this homeless guy
showed me his purple head,

10:37.437 --> 10:39.838
but looking back,
I'm-I'm not so sure

10:39.840 --> 10:41.139
that that was really
a military thing.

10:41.141 --> 10:42.941
Pfft. I didn't want
that stupid medal.

10:42.943 --> 10:44.309
You know what I
did with it?

10:44.311 --> 10:46.144
I threw it back over
the White House fence.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.512
Wait a minute.
I thought you said

10:47.514 --> 10:49.014
you flew straight
home from Kuwait

10:49.016 --> 10:50.849
after you woke
from your coma.

10:50.851 --> 10:53.551
When did you throw your medal
over the White House fence?

10:53.553 --> 10:56.454
N-N-N-No, I-I-I told you, I flew
to D.C., ditched the medals,

10:56.456 --> 10:57.656
and flew home.

10:57.658 --> 10:59.858
I guess that was just
his dirty hobo penis, huh?

10:59.860 --> 11:01.660
Kevin, why would you
want to get rid of

11:01.662 --> 11:02.961
your war medals
like that?

11:02.963 --> 11:04.596
'Cause it was
a stupid war, you know?

11:04.598 --> 11:07.666
All it did was put me in a coma
and kill one of my bunkmates

11:07.668 --> 11:09.434
and cripple the other one
for life.

11:09.436 --> 11:10.802
W-Wait a minute.

11:10.804 --> 11:12.003
Now, I thought
earlier you said

11:12.005 --> 11:13.872
that both of your
bunkmates were killed.

11:13.874 --> 11:16.307
Now you're saying
only one of them was?

11:16.309 --> 11:17.976
But I just want
you guys to know

11:17.978 --> 11:19.878
I barely even stared
at that penis for an hour.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.279
What? Come on, Dad.

11:21.281 --> 11:22.547
Whatev.

11:22.549 --> 11:23.948
H-Hey, why's it
so hot in here?

11:23.950 --> 11:25.150
It's too hot in here.

11:25.152 --> 11:26.184
Wait a minute.

11:26.186 --> 11:27.786
An Ed Hardy T-shirt?

11:27.788 --> 11:30.021
That particular
strain of douche bag

11:30.023 --> 11:32.023
didn't arise
until 2007,

11:32.025 --> 11:34.025
while you were
supposedly in your coma.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.193
Look, get off my case, Dad!

11:35.195 --> 11:36.661
What do you want from me?

11:36.663 --> 11:37.662
The truth.

11:37.664 --> 11:39.164
Fine! Here's the truth!

11:39.166 --> 11:40.932
I was never in any coma, okay?

11:40.934 --> 11:41.966
I bailed.

11:41.968 --> 11:43.935
I faked my death and went AWOL.

11:43.937 --> 11:44.669
(all gasp)

11:44.671 --> 11:46.504
I faked my own death once.

11:51.110 --> 11:53.178
(sobbing)

11:57.016 --> 11:59.084
(dirt crunching)

12:02.388 --> 12:03.521
(chuckles)

12:03.523 --> 12:06.291
No dentist appointment
for this guy.

12:06.293 --> 12:07.525
So, there it is.

12:07.527 --> 12:08.793
I'm not a war hero.

12:08.795 --> 12:09.961
I abandoned my platoon.

12:09.963 --> 12:11.362
So now what do we do?

12:12.331 --> 12:14.032
Me?

12:14.034 --> 12:15.934
Am-Am I, am I supposed
to say something?

12:15.936 --> 12:17.769
Kevin,

12:17.771 --> 12:19.838
you're under arrest for
the crime of desertion.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.139
Oh, my.

12:21.141 --> 12:23.942
Um, maybe it's time for us
girls to hit the powder room.

12:23.944 --> 12:25.009
You may use
the yard.

12:31.650 --> 12:34.152
So you were lying
to us this whole time?

12:34.154 --> 12:36.054
You weren't really
injured in Iraq?

12:36.056 --> 12:39.023
First Pat Tillman lies
about how he died and now you?

12:39.025 --> 12:40.859
Kevin, I don't
understand.

12:40.861 --> 12:42.093
There's nothing to understand.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.762
Our son is a deserter.

12:43.764 --> 12:45.363
Come on, Kevin,
I'm taking you to jail.

12:45.365 --> 12:47.031
Joe, wait!
Not now, Bonnie.

12:47.033 --> 12:48.166
Joe, you can't!

12:48.168 --> 12:49.501
Bonnie, we'll discuss
this later!

12:49.503 --> 12:52.303
Joe! You're not taking
my son anywhere.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.205
Damn it, you guys
are ruining Thanksgiving!

12:54.207 --> 12:56.007
And it's my second
favorite holiday,

12:56.009 --> 12:58.977
right after Pretend Not
To Notice People's Race Day.

12:58.979 --> 13:00.111
Hey, you seen
Reggie around?

13:00.113 --> 13:01.846
Which one is Reggie?

13:01.848 --> 13:04.649
Oh, uh, today he's
wearing yellow pants,

13:04.651 --> 13:08.453
uh, yellow shirt, yellow
hat, yellow shoes.

13:08.455 --> 13:11.289
Uh, he's got a gold tooth,
uh, diamond earring.

13:11.291 --> 13:14.359
Um, he's got that big necklace
with the dollar sign on it.

13:14.361 --> 13:16.594
Uh, he's always
grabbing his crotch

13:16.596 --> 13:17.662
when he's
telling a story.

13:17.664 --> 13:19.130
Like the one about
when he found out

13:19.132 --> 13:20.698
his mother is really
his grandmother.

13:20.700 --> 13:22.000
Could you be more specific?

13:22.002 --> 13:23.501
Uh, oh, let's see.

13:23.503 --> 13:25.770
Uh, he always wears
cheap cologne.

13:25.772 --> 13:29.040
Uh, drives a Mercury Cougar
with a crown on the dashboard.

13:29.042 --> 13:31.009
Uh, never pays
his alimony.

13:31.011 --> 13:33.778
Uh, he's extremely cut for
a guy who never works out.

13:33.780 --> 13:35.180
Oh, there he is.
Thanks anyway.

13:35.182 --> 13:36.447
Hey, Reggie!

13:37.716 --> 13:39.217
Look, maybe we should
just let Kevin

13:39.219 --> 13:41.186
explain why he did what he did.

13:42.121 --> 13:43.121
(sighs)

13:43.123 --> 13:44.923
At first,
I believed in the cause.

13:44.925 --> 13:47.292
But then I saw what we were
doing to the people of Iraq.

13:47.294 --> 13:48.426
Innocent people.

13:48.428 --> 13:50.528
There was one
that I'll never forget.

13:50.530 --> 13:52.797
<i>He was a little</i>
<i>Iraqi street kid.</i>

13:52.799 --> 13:54.699
<i>I'd befriended him</i>
<i>a few months earlier.</i>

13:54.701 --> 13:56.601
<i>Couldn't have been</i>
<i>more than 12 years old.</i>

13:56.603 --> 13:59.170
I taught him how to crack wise,
<i>American style.</i>

14:00.673 --> 14:02.807
(people screaming)

14:02.809 --> 14:05.310
I guess that store's
having a fire sale.

14:05.312 --> 14:07.011
(laughs)

14:07.013 --> 14:09.480
<i>I tell you, that kid was</i>
<i>strong-headed for his age.</i>

14:09.482 --> 14:10.949
<i>Smart, but innocent.</i>

14:10.951 --> 14:13.618
<i>And then one day,</i>
<i>there was a fire fight.</i>

14:23.095 --> 14:26.164
<i>We bring in this civilian who</i>
<i>got killed in the crossfire.</i>

14:27.766 --> 14:30.134
<i>I pull back the sheet,</i>
<i>and who is it?</i>

14:30.136 --> 14:31.469
<i>Not the kid, but, like,</i>

14:31.471 --> 14:34.038
<i>the kid's dad's, like,</i>
<i>coworker's neighbor.</i>

14:34.040 --> 14:36.975
<i>He was 74 and he had actually</i>
<i>tried to rape someone.</i>

14:36.977 --> 14:39.177
<i>But just looking down</i>
<i>at his dead face</i>

14:39.179 --> 14:42.146
<i>and knowing that he lived near</i>
<i>someone who worked with the dad</i>

14:42.148 --> 14:45.516
<i>of the kid whose name I never</i>
<i>found out, I lost all hope.</i>

14:45.518 --> 14:48.019
<i>That's when I knew</i>
<i>I had to get out of Iraq.</i>

14:48.021 --> 14:50.154
<i>I just had to wait</i>
<i>for my chance.</i>

14:50.156 --> 14:51.122
I call the white meat!

14:51.124 --> 14:53.992
I call the cell phone
duct taped to the side!

14:53.994 --> 14:55.059
No!

14:58.964 --> 15:01.366
<i>Somehow, I'd been spared</i>
<i>that Thanksgiving.</i>

15:01.368 --> 15:03.968
<i>But I can't say the same</i>
<i>for my bunkmates.</i>

15:03.970 --> 15:06.037
<i>There were bits and pieces</i>
<i>of them everywhere.</i>

15:06.039 --> 15:08.973
<i>I knew the Army would never be</i>
<i>able to identify who was who.</i>

15:08.975 --> 15:12.176
<i>So that was my chance</i>
<i>to disappear.</i>

15:12.178 --> 15:13.344
So I left.

15:13.346 --> 15:14.812
How could you
do that?!

15:14.814 --> 15:16.014
Coward!
Traitor!

15:16.016 --> 15:18.016
If you think
that I'm gonna masturbate

15:18.018 --> 15:20.218
after this tonight,
you're right.

15:20.220 --> 15:22.120
We don't have to sit
here and listen to this.

15:22.122 --> 15:24.122
Come on, Kevin, let's
get out of here.

15:24.124 --> 15:25.657
Nice try, skank.
Worth a shot.

15:25.659 --> 15:28.092
Well, where did you go
after you left the war?

15:28.094 --> 15:29.827
I spent a few years laying low.

15:29.829 --> 15:31.496
Wrote some poems.
You want to hear some?

15:31.498 --> 15:32.497
No.
Are you sure?

15:32.499 --> 15:33.765
They're pretty intense.

15:33.767 --> 15:35.633
ALL:
No.
Here, let me just read one.

15:35.635 --> 15:38.102
If I can guess a line in there,
will you not read it?

15:38.104 --> 15:39.804
I don't think you'll be able
to guess a line.

15:39.806 --> 15:42.807
Is it something like,
"Ice burns as hot as fire"?

15:42.809 --> 15:46.945
Okay, so then I went to Europe,
Australia, Canada, all over.

15:46.947 --> 15:48.880
But I really missed you guys.

15:48.882 --> 15:51.816
I wanted to be with people
who love me, no matter what.

15:51.818 --> 15:53.151
So I came home.

15:53.153 --> 15:54.385
Well, it sounds
to me like

15:54.387 --> 15:56.888
you're a regular
Benedict Arnold Drummond.

15:56.890 --> 15:58.823
W-What's he expecting us
to cut to?

15:58.825 --> 16:00.625
I think he wants maybe--
I don't know--

16:00.627 --> 16:01.960
Gary Coleman
in a Napoleon hat?

16:01.962 --> 16:03.094
But we don't have that.

16:03.096 --> 16:04.362
We-We got to come up
with something.

16:04.364 --> 16:05.997
Well, we got, uh, we got

16:05.999 --> 16:07.832
"The Cowardly Lion is
Lindsay Lohan's gynecologist."

16:07.834 --> 16:08.967
Play it, play it.

16:08.969 --> 16:10.335
But he didn't set it up.
Play it!

16:10.337 --> 16:12.036
All right, I'm gonna
check her for diseases.

16:12.038 --> 16:14.105
There's just one thing
I want you to do.

16:14.107 --> 16:15.106
What's that?
What's that?

16:15.108 --> 16:16.307
Talk me out of it.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.142
TIN MAN and SCARECROW:
No, no, no, no, no, no.

16:18.144 --> 16:20.511
What the hell
is going on up there?

16:20.513 --> 16:22.814
Well, I'm sorry
you all feel the way you do.

16:22.816 --> 16:25.116
But I walked away from
an illegal war of aggression

16:25.118 --> 16:28.152
being fought 6,000 miles away
from our shores.

16:28.154 --> 16:29.954
Better there than here
where all my stuff is.

16:29.956 --> 16:33.091
So, what, you figured you'd just
let 'em get away with 9/11?

16:33.093 --> 16:35.593
Mr. Griffin, Iraq had
nothing to do with 9/11.

16:35.595 --> 16:38.463
And the war we started in Iraq
has killed a half a million

16:38.465 --> 16:41.432
of their people, which
is like 200 9/11's.

16:41.434 --> 16:44.035
So, I guess those moments
of silence we had

16:44.037 --> 16:45.837
at those sporting events
meant nothing to you.

16:45.839 --> 16:47.538
I'm just saying
this war is wrong.

16:47.540 --> 16:51.342
Son, your job isn't to decide
whether it's right or wrong.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.444
Your job is to
follow orders.

16:53.446 --> 16:55.279
Well, that's what the Nazi
soldiers did, isn't it?

16:55.281 --> 16:56.514
They followed orders.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.449
You're saying our troops
are like the Nazis?!

16:58.451 --> 17:01.853
No, I'm just saying that blindly
following orders has resulted

17:01.855 --> 17:04.022
in the deaths of millions
of people throughout history.

17:04.024 --> 17:06.624
You know, I have not talked
to Carol all night.

17:06.626 --> 17:08.126
Carol, how are you?

17:08.128 --> 17:10.595
Look, I think you guys are
all rushing to judge Kevin

17:10.597 --> 17:13.197
without knowing what it was like
to be in his shoes.

17:13.199 --> 17:16.300
He saw horrific things,
in a horrific war,

17:16.302 --> 17:18.269
that only one other person here

17:18.271 --> 17:21.139
could possibly come close
to understanding: Ida.

17:21.141 --> 17:22.473
She was in the military.

17:22.475 --> 17:23.975
She's seen battle.

17:23.977 --> 17:26.644
She's seen innocent people
butchered by war machines.

17:26.646 --> 17:29.113
And I'm sure that Ida,
more than anyone else here,

17:29.115 --> 17:32.183
can understand and support
the choice that Kevin made.

17:32.185 --> 17:35.620
No, Brian, I do not understand
Kevin's choice,

17:35.622 --> 17:37.188
and I do not support it.

17:37.190 --> 17:38.990
Okay, well, that's just
some dumb drag queen.

17:38.992 --> 17:41.759
Son, when you go to war,
you don't end up

17:41.761 --> 17:45.029
fighting for your country
or your family or your flag.

17:45.031 --> 17:46.764
You're fighting for
your fellow soldiers

17:46.766 --> 17:48.766
there in the foxhole with you.

17:48.768 --> 17:52.370
You walked out on those men, and
that's what's most unforgivable.

17:52.372 --> 17:54.172
You know what, everyone?
Forget it.

17:54.174 --> 17:56.040
Up till today,
you guys thought I was dead.

17:56.042 --> 17:57.041
Well, I'm not.

17:57.043 --> 17:58.309
But after all this,

17:58.311 --> 18:00.011
Dad, you may as well
take me to prison,

18:00.013 --> 18:02.046
'cause right now
I wish I was dead.

18:02.048 --> 18:05.349
If anyone has wanted whip cream
on their pie, it's not my fault.

18:05.351 --> 18:07.885
I can't get a (bleep) word
in edgewise around here.

18:07.887 --> 18:09.954
Kevin, I don't want
to lose you again.

18:09.956 --> 18:11.789
But I do have
a job to do.

18:11.791 --> 18:12.990
So get moving.

18:12.992 --> 18:15.426
'Cause there's at least
one Swanson man in this room

18:15.428 --> 18:16.494
who does his duty.

18:16.496 --> 18:17.829
Doodie means poop.
It does.

18:17.831 --> 18:18.930
Are you, Dad?

18:18.932 --> 18:20.832
Are you the only one
who does his duty?

18:20.834 --> 18:22.166
That's not
how I remember it.

18:22.168 --> 18:23.367
What are you
talking about?

18:23.369 --> 18:24.869
You don't remember, do you?

18:24.871 --> 18:26.471
I was in first grade.

18:26.473 --> 18:28.806
<i>You took me out with you</i>
<i>on one of your shifts.</i>

18:28.808 --> 18:30.675
I just think it's
presumptuous.

18:30.677 --> 18:32.844
I mean, come on, "the
country's best yogurt"?

18:32.846 --> 18:33.978
You know, prove it.

18:33.980 --> 18:35.313
Show me your data.

18:35.315 --> 18:36.481
MAN:
Help! Police!

18:36.483 --> 18:38.516
That man's a thief!

18:39.985 --> 18:41.719
Go get him, Dad!

18:50.996 --> 18:54.065
Reach for the sky, dirtbag!

18:57.035 --> 18:58.269
What the hell?

18:58.271 --> 18:59.370
I'm sorry, Officer.

18:59.372 --> 19:01.339
I-I was just trying
to feed my family.

19:01.341 --> 19:03.975
I don't care what you were
trying to do, you broke the law.

19:03.977 --> 19:04.976
I know.

19:04.978 --> 19:06.611
I didn't know what else to do.

19:06.613 --> 19:09.080
I have three very wide-eyed
children to feed.

19:10.682 --> 19:13.684
Wide-eyed children
are the hungriest.

19:13.686 --> 19:17.155
Kids, Daddy has to go away
for a while, okay?

19:17.157 --> 19:19.023
Take care of Mommy
until she dies tomorrow.

19:19.025 --> 19:20.124
It's okay, Daddy.

19:20.126 --> 19:22.026
I'll be the man of the shack
while you're gone.

19:22.028 --> 19:24.095
(coughing)

19:26.265 --> 19:29.433
Uh, listen,
there's been a mistake.

19:29.435 --> 19:31.469
I'm not here
to arrest your father.

19:31.471 --> 19:32.270
You're not?

19:32.272 --> 19:33.671
No, Son.

19:33.673 --> 19:36.541
I just came over to tell you
what a great guy your father is

19:36.543 --> 19:38.976
and how hard he's been
working for all of you.

19:38.978 --> 19:40.511
Wait. You're letting me go?

19:40.513 --> 19:42.146
I don't understand.

19:42.148 --> 19:44.148
I'm not sure I do either.

19:44.150 --> 19:46.617
I know the law says
I have to arrest you.

19:46.619 --> 19:49.353
But sometimes the law
is just a piece of paper.

19:49.355 --> 19:51.189
There's right, there's wrong,

19:51.191 --> 19:54.325
and somewhere in between,
there's life.

19:54.327 --> 19:56.394
You folks have a good day.

19:58.163 --> 20:00.498
I never forgot what you did.

20:00.500 --> 20:03.167
Well, thanks for
coming, you guys.

20:03.169 --> 20:05.303
You know what you were
doing that day, Dad?

20:05.305 --> 20:06.804
You were breaking the law.

20:06.806 --> 20:09.674
You knew what your duty told you
you were supposed to do,

20:09.676 --> 20:12.476
but instead, you did
what you thought was right.

20:12.478 --> 20:15.780
I haven't thought about
that family in years.

20:15.782 --> 20:17.281
I think about them
all the time.

20:17.283 --> 20:19.650
And the example
you set for me that day.

20:19.652 --> 20:21.485
It's the very reason
I left Iraq.

20:21.487 --> 20:23.955
It sucks how early
I have to work.

20:23.957 --> 20:24.989
(sighs)

20:24.991 --> 20:27.124
Well, Kevin,
I still can't say

20:27.126 --> 20:29.126
that I agree
with your choice.

20:29.128 --> 20:30.795
Not one bit.

20:30.797 --> 20:32.163
But I suppose
sometimes a man

20:32.165 --> 20:33.931
has to do
what he thinks is right.

20:33.933 --> 20:36.167
And if that's what
you thought was right,

20:36.169 --> 20:38.202
I guess I can accept it.

20:38.937 --> 20:40.638
I'm glad you're
home, son.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.073
Me, too, Dad.

20:44.009 --> 20:46.944
You know, there's still
some pumpkin pie left, everyone.

20:46.946 --> 20:48.045
That sounds
good to me.

20:48.047 --> 20:49.180
Me, too.

20:49.182 --> 20:51.983
Hey, happy Thanksgiving
to us all, huh?

20:51.985 --> 20:54.352
(excited chattering)

20:54.354 --> 20:56.320
USA! USA!

20:56.322 --> 20:57.355
MAN:
Wait!

20:57.357 --> 20:58.956
That man's an imposter.

20:58.958 --> 21:00.725
I'm the real Kevin Swanson!

21:00.727 --> 21:02.426
Guys, I don't think
we have time for this.
