E. R.

00:04.576 --> 00:05.854
Previously on E. R.

00:05.955 --> 00:07.601
Did you sleep well?

00:07.902 --> 00:08.802
Yes. It was great.

00:08.903 --> 00:11.265
I'm afraid
it's definitely tumor re-growth.

00:11.366 --> 00:13.045
How much time?

00:13.146 --> 00:16.180
If this works, 10 months.

00:16.280 --> 00:17.665
I'm gonna go out and get some Zofran.

00:17.766 --> 00:20.241
No, no, no. Stay. Stay.

00:20.817 --> 00:22.504
It'll pass.

01:06.471 --> 01:08.677
Problem with the office supplies?

01:08.849 --> 01:12.929
- I just pronounced Bertha.
- Blue Bertha?

01:13.103 --> 01:17.516
I admitted her 10 times for COPD
in the last six months.

01:17.692 --> 01:19.435
She must have liked you a lot.

01:19.611 --> 01:23.822
Every time, she swore to me
she'd quit smoking. Every time.

01:23.990 --> 01:26.528
Behind the crack, no rim.

01:31.248 --> 01:34.949
As soon as she was discharged,
though, boy, back to two packs a day.

01:35.127 --> 01:37.120
I even saw her light up
under the arch once.

01:37.296 --> 01:42.539
Intubated her three times this year,
high-dose steroids, home nebulizer.

01:42.719 --> 01:45.589
Dragging her O-2 tank
around with her.

01:47.057 --> 01:49.097
- That's an H for you.
- What's the point...

01:49.267 --> 01:52.553
...if you're not gonna take
a little responsibility for your health?

01:52.729 --> 01:55.482
I call this the "spirit killer. "

02:02.823 --> 02:05.860
- Is it supposed to rain again?
- That's an O for you.

02:06.035 --> 02:08.241
I think it's gonna rain again.

02:08.413 --> 02:13.075
We offer them a service. Whether they
take our advice or not is up to them.

02:13.252 --> 02:15.826
She'd still be alive
if she'd listened to our advice.

02:16.005 --> 02:21.843
Hard as it was to deal with Blue Bertha,
it's still harder to be Blue Bertha.

02:22.887 --> 02:24.927
- Not anymore.
- Dr. Carter...

02:25.432 --> 02:27.306
...there's a rig
rolling in with an MVA...

02:27.476 --> 02:29.967
...and I got a researcher
at the Art Institute. LOC.

02:30.145 --> 02:32.766
- Greg Pratt? Mark Greene.
- How you doing?

02:32.939 --> 02:36.985
- What did he do to deserve us?
- He just finished nine months at the VA.

02:37.153 --> 02:40.107
- Three months of internship?
- Yes, I'll be a Resident in July.

02:40.281 --> 02:43.068
- Here?
- Only if the match screws me.

02:43.826 --> 02:45.903
- Nice.
- No. But I'm ready to jump in.

02:46.079 --> 02:49.530
- Seen it all, one way or another.
- Is that right?

02:50.500 --> 02:54.878
- You want us to grab that?
- No, you've got your museum lady.

02:55.047 --> 02:58.084
- I'll help you with that crossover later.
- I think I got it.

02:58.926 --> 03:00.290
You're palming it.

03:53.692 --> 03:56.064
The idiot chucked the ball
right at my head.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.774
There's a little blood.
You have a tiny perforation.

03:58.947 --> 04:01.154
He popped my eardrum.

04:01.325 --> 04:04.077
We see it all the time.
Give you some drops to help it heal.

04:04.245 --> 04:07.744
- Some "clops"?
- Some drops. Cortisporin suspension.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.540
Okay.

04:09.709 --> 04:12.247
- Thanks. So what should you be?
- What?

04:12.462 --> 04:15.665
- Frank's career-aptitude quiz.
- He hasn't cornered me yet.

04:15.841 --> 04:18.213
- What is this?
- It's green tea. It's echinacea.

04:18.385 --> 04:21.421
- Good for the immune system.
- I'll stick to the normal sludge.

04:21.596 --> 04:22.972
You have to get that yourself.

04:23.140 --> 04:26.426
Would you rather pose nude
or be bit by a ferret?

04:26.602 --> 04:28.097
- Ferret.
- How's he doing?

04:28.271 --> 04:30.596
Somewhere between rock star
and lion-tamer.

04:30.773 --> 04:33.312
- Did you cheat?
- Just a hint of Mick Jagger.

04:33.443 --> 04:36.397
- And a whole lot of Siegfried and Roy?
- I have a patient.

04:36.571 --> 04:39.526
Nursing orders, IV's,
medications go on that rack.

04:39.700 --> 04:42.108
If you've got both clerk
and nursing orders-

04:42.244 --> 04:43.821
Start with the clerk rack.

04:43.996 --> 04:45.490
- Frank.
- Pratt.

04:45.664 --> 04:48.370
- Got a first name?
- At the VA, they called me "Doctor. "

04:48.543 --> 04:50.120
Well, here we'll call you "Junior. "

04:50.295 --> 04:53.629
Luka, can you take the chest pain in 3
and the kid with the UTI?

04:53.798 --> 04:55.921
- I already have three criticals.
- I'll take it.

04:56.093 --> 05:00.304
Oh, no, that's okay.
Carter, grab my rule-out appy.

05:00.472 --> 05:03.010
- And the hunt for the lost condom.
- Sounds like fun.

05:03.184 --> 05:05.722
- Abby, your landlord called.
- My landlord?

05:05.895 --> 05:08.812
- This the respiratory distress?
- Norma Cruz, 46 years old...

05:08.982 --> 05:11.058
...choking episode,
severe multiple sclerosis.

05:11.233 --> 05:13.226
- Abby?
- Carter.

05:13.403 --> 05:18.314
- I'm good. Is this her base line?
- Not sure. The son should be here soon.

05:18.992 --> 05:21.364
All the bay-station calls
come in over the MICN.

05:21.536 --> 05:23.529
- Okay.
- Don't touch it, Junior.

05:23.706 --> 05:24.869
Don't call me that.

05:25.040 --> 05:27.958
My point was, it wouldn't
hurt us to lighten Dr. Greene's load.

05:28.127 --> 05:29.372
- Right.
- Yeah, sure.

05:29.545 --> 05:31.834
- Why? What's the problem?
- Nothing.

05:32.006 --> 05:34.841
- Can't get a line in.
- Chem panel, UA and a Foley.

05:35.009 --> 05:38.260
- Is she moving air?
- Sounds like rhonchi at the bases.

05:38.430 --> 05:41.135
- This is Jeffrey, Mrs. Cruz's son.
- Hi, I'm Dr. Greene.

05:41.308 --> 05:45.520
- Is your mother normally this sick?
- They said she'd be dead a month ago.

05:45.688 --> 05:48.143
He filled me in on her history.
I can take this.

05:48.315 --> 05:50.807
Is it my birthday or something?

05:51.652 --> 05:53.479
It's okay for me
to treat my own patient?

05:53.655 --> 05:54.686
Sorry.

05:56.115 --> 05:59.366
- Did your mother throw up?
- No, we never feed her by mouth.

05:59.536 --> 06:02.537
- Might be obstructed.
- She have a "do not resuscitate" order?

06:02.748 --> 06:05.239
Her veins are shot.
I'm never gonna get a good line.

06:05.667 --> 06:08.669
Jeffrey, your mother
probably has an aspiration pneumonia.

06:08.837 --> 06:13.050
We can have a surgeon look at her, but
she'll need an IV to give her antibiotics.

06:13.176 --> 06:15.383
- I need to wait for Linda.
- Who's Linda?

06:15.553 --> 06:17.629
My sister, a lawyer.
She drew up the papers.

06:17.805 --> 06:20.724
- Pressure's dropping, 80 systolic.
- I don't think we have time.

06:20.892 --> 06:23.847
Do you want us to administer drugs
to push up her blood pressure?

06:24.021 --> 06:27.224
- I can't. I need to wait.
- You gotta tell me.

06:30.236 --> 06:32.561
Central-line kit now.

06:33.114 --> 06:36.991
Willa Goment. Egyptologist from the
Art Institute. Syncopal episode at work.

06:37.160 --> 06:39.153
She have any medical conditions
you know of?

06:39.329 --> 06:41.571
- The curse of the mummy.
- The what?

06:41.748 --> 06:44.073
I found her
on the floor of Nefertiti's tomb.

06:45.335 --> 06:47.826
Guy in Curtain 1 is hurting.
Can I give him something?

06:48.005 --> 06:51.041
- I'll take it.
- Do a quick exam and then call Uro.

06:51.217 --> 06:53.423
- You got it.
- It's a penile fracture.

06:53.594 --> 06:56.714
- Penile fracture?
- Up to 100 of fentanyl.

06:57.515 --> 06:59.841
- One, right?
- Yeah, it's over there.

07:00.018 --> 07:01.346
I'm all over it.

07:01.520 --> 07:06.147
- So no history of these episodes?
- Carter, he's going in the wrong room.

07:06.316 --> 07:08.025
He'll figure it out.

07:09.195 --> 07:11.733
Let me take a look.

07:11.906 --> 07:15.275
You wanna unbuckle your belt
and pull your pants down, please?

07:15.452 --> 07:18.655
- My pants? What?
- It's okay, I'm a doctor.

07:18.830 --> 07:21.701
I'm still waiting for some drops!

07:21.875 --> 07:25.659
That's not gonna do it.
The pants, please.

07:30.885 --> 07:33.969
Are you sure this is necessary?

07:34.931 --> 07:36.970
Could you lean back a little bit?

07:38.018 --> 07:40.888
- Easy there.
- Were you having vigorous sex?

07:41.063 --> 07:43.814
What? No, I was hit in the head!

07:45.317 --> 07:49.481
Most sprains happen along the shaft,
but yours seems to be pretty minor.

07:49.655 --> 07:51.447
Nothing personal.

07:51.615 --> 07:54.782
Dude, I have an earache.

08:00.333 --> 08:03.038
Well, then come down here, then.

08:03.670 --> 08:05.294
Fine.

08:05.672 --> 08:09.373
Don't worry, it's not always as simple as
it seems on the other end of the phone.

08:09.551 --> 08:14.380
No, she's right. Mom told us she wanted
to die at home in her own bed.

08:14.557 --> 08:17.095
I should have never
have called the ambulance.

08:17.268 --> 08:21.516
It's okay
if you don't want to let her go.

08:21.690 --> 08:25.687
But that'll never stop.
I'll always want more.

08:25.861 --> 08:29.277
Dr. Greene, her sats are down to 86.

08:29.448 --> 08:32.153
Decreased on the right.
Portable chest, page RT.

08:32.326 --> 08:34.782
- Surgery see her?
- Dr. Corday said she'd evaluate...

08:34.953 --> 08:38.489
- ... in four hours, depending on the DNR.
- Pressure's down to 70 systolic.

08:38.667 --> 08:41.870
- What's happening?
- She reaspirated or collapsed a lung.

08:42.044 --> 08:44.371
I thought you said she was okay now.

08:44.548 --> 08:48.759
Jeffrey, your mother's not gonna be able
to breathe much longer on her own.

08:48.928 --> 08:51.419
- Do you want us to help her?
- Linda said not to.

08:51.597 --> 08:55.465
Well, she's not here right now.
You have to tell us.

08:55.643 --> 08:56.888
Save her.

08:57.061 --> 08:59.897
- You sure?
- Just do it. Do everything.

09:00.064 --> 09:04.525
Okay, rapid induction.
7.5 ET tube and a 3 Mac.

09:04.694 --> 09:07.898
500 of Levo, 600 of clinda.

09:08.073 --> 09:11.027
- Drugs are on board.
- Bag her.

09:11.202 --> 09:13.954
Sats are down to 80, Mark.

09:15.081 --> 09:17.406
Let's go, let's go. Give me the tube.

09:25.800 --> 09:27.260
My fault. Sorry.

09:27.427 --> 09:30.631
Abby, I need a stress dose
of 125 of Solu-Medrol.

09:30.806 --> 09:32.384
Here.

09:34.602 --> 09:36.393
I'll do it.

09:37.605 --> 09:40.310
All right, give me a straight blade.

09:41.318 --> 09:43.606
Okay, get steroids.

09:48.409 --> 09:51.113
Sensor, intuitor, judger.

09:51.286 --> 09:53.778
- I never thought of myself as judger.
- Yeah, right.

09:53.956 --> 09:55.534
- What?
- Check judger, Frank.

09:55.708 --> 09:57.617
Mind your own business.
This is my career.

09:57.793 --> 10:00.629
- Won't work if you're not honest.
- Oh, who's judging now?

10:00.797 --> 10:02.505
I've earned it.

10:02.674 --> 10:04.465
- Hey, Mark.
- Hey.

10:04.634 --> 10:07.090
Dr. Greene, your ex called.
She'll meet you at 1.

10:07.513 --> 10:11.297
- I thought she said noon.
- She's running an hour late.

10:12.101 --> 10:14.426
- What'd Weaver get?
- She ain't playing.

10:14.604 --> 10:15.979
Give your best estimate.

10:16.147 --> 10:20.476
"Subgroup P3: Beauty pageant organizer
or warden at a women's prison."

10:20.651 --> 10:24.864
- Carter, where's your intern?
- Either Radiology or the cafeteria.

10:25.031 --> 10:27.404
Find him.

10:30.871 --> 10:35.118
- You all right?
- Early-onset arthritis. Coffee?

10:36.335 --> 10:39.336
Maybe you should ease up a little.

10:39.506 --> 10:42.423
- I'm fine, Kerry.
- You do triage for awhile if you want...

10:42.591 --> 10:44.501
...or take a half-shift.

10:44.678 --> 10:47.003
Working is good.

10:47.181 --> 10:50.015
You need to make sure
you're taking care of yourself.

10:50.183 --> 10:53.054
There's no need to overextend.
We can handle the load.

10:53.228 --> 10:56.562
I just want to keep doing
what I've always done.

10:57.900 --> 11:02.396
- You couldn't hold that ET tube.
- It's little spasms in my hand.

11:04.282 --> 11:06.903
Is that from the vincristine?

11:09.121 --> 11:12.620
A side effect of the treatment
or a progression of the disease.

11:12.792 --> 11:14.286
You pick the poison.

11:15.544 --> 11:19.210
Still, I'd like you
to take over Pratt's orientation.

11:19.966 --> 11:22.124
Whatever you want, Kerry.

11:22.718 --> 11:26.883
It might be best if you left
critical procedures to the rest of us.

11:27.932 --> 11:30.175
You're pulling me
out of the Trauma Room?

11:31.102 --> 11:36.939
Anybody else I'd send home. I trust you
to recognize your own limitations.

11:42.866 --> 11:45.107
I take pills for my blood pressure
and my water.

11:45.285 --> 11:47.408
Water in your legs
or to make you urinate?

11:47.579 --> 11:50.284
Hytrin. It helped me pee for a while,
but it's worse now.

11:50.457 --> 11:52.081
- That hurts?
- You bet.

11:52.250 --> 11:55.415
- Put the med and back pain together.
- Alpha-1-blocker.

11:55.588 --> 11:59.170
- And if you take too much?
- Hypotension, could make you dizzy.

11:59.800 --> 12:02.920
- You had any falls, Mr. Seidel?
- Nope. Good question, though.

12:03.095 --> 12:06.430
- Who's your primary physician?
- Allanson. Service said he went skiing...

12:06.600 --> 12:08.094
...I should come here.

12:08.310 --> 12:12.093
Hypotensive at 140/90.
Pulse, 96. Oral temp, 98.6.

12:12.272 --> 12:14.431
I've had two Foleys since Christmas.

12:14.649 --> 12:17.485
Has Dr. Allanson ever asked you
to use a catheter at home?

12:17.653 --> 12:21.775
Last time, I twisted his arm for a blood
test. I still haven't gotten the results.

12:22.450 --> 12:24.905
- What do you want to do, Dr. Pratt?
- Full set of labs.

12:25.078 --> 12:28.364
Urine, culture, Accu-Chek,
a post-void residual and a rectal.

12:28.540 --> 12:33.118
- Are you sure? My guy never does those.
- Dr. Greene, it's 1:00.

12:33.963 --> 12:36.750
Add a PSA.
I'll be back in half an hour.

12:36.924 --> 12:39.712
- Can I get you anything?
- No, thanks.

12:41.137 --> 12:45.467
- Milk shake, huh?
- I decided to let myself go.

12:47.185 --> 12:50.352
I can't stay long.
I just wanted to stop by and say hi.

12:50.522 --> 12:54.390
- Did you see Rachel?
- We had breakfast. Her favorite.

12:54.568 --> 12:56.442
Waffle House?

12:56.612 --> 12:59.483
That'll score you some points.

12:59.657 --> 13:02.611
She couldn't stop crying, Mark.

13:03.244 --> 13:05.486
It's a lot for a teenager to take in.

13:06.122 --> 13:07.949
It's a lot for anyone.

13:09.835 --> 13:12.504
It's really that bad?

13:13.005 --> 13:14.832
Yeah.

13:15.007 --> 13:19.170
There are always breakthroughs, right?
I mean, look what happened last time.

13:20.012 --> 13:21.970
I'm kind of beyond that.

13:26.728 --> 13:30.393
We agreed Rachel would be with me July
and August. If you want to change that-

13:30.565 --> 13:34.813
- No, that sounds like a good plan.
- She could stay with you longer.

13:34.987 --> 13:37.941
I mean, she's gonna want
to spend time with you.

13:38.115 --> 13:40.820
As much time as possible.

13:41.077 --> 13:43.365
Thanks.

13:46.499 --> 13:48.872
I'm sorry, Mark.

13:50.545 --> 13:53.250
I'm sorry we had such a rough go.

13:56.885 --> 14:01.548
Maybe if I hadn't switched jobs
or been more patient...

14:02.350 --> 14:05.387
We made choices, Jen.

14:05.561 --> 14:06.972
Both of us.

14:16.198 --> 14:18.487
We weren't so bad together,
were we?

14:24.957 --> 14:27.828
I wouldn't change a thing.

14:28.670 --> 14:30.378
None of it.

14:37.930 --> 14:41.264
Okay. So I gotta get to Midway.

14:41.433 --> 14:44.103
Wait. I updated my will last year, but-

14:44.269 --> 14:47.604
Look at it out there.
It's gonna take me hours.

14:51.570 --> 14:54.357
I want to start a college fund.

14:54.530 --> 14:58.031
Well, you'll drop Rachel off
in St. Louis in July. We can talk then.

14:58.201 --> 15:02.034
- I don't know if I'll be able to make that.
- Yes, you will.

15:02.205 --> 15:05.954
I want to set something aside
for her wedding, too.

15:06.127 --> 15:10.754
July, okay?
Let's not do this. Not today.

15:11.799 --> 15:14.207
I don't know
if there'll be another time.

15:14.386 --> 15:17.303
She's my daughter. I want to make sure
that she's taken care of.

15:17.472 --> 15:19.631
- She will be.
- Jen-

15:19.808 --> 15:22.474
I'll see you in St. Louis.

15:50.755 --> 15:54.837
- Heads. Heads up.
- Slow down. Hey!

15:55.011 --> 15:58.013
- Enrique, the new orderly.
- He's gonna kill someone.

15:58.183 --> 16:00.674
He keeps the rooms clear.

16:00.853 --> 16:03.179
- So what did he want?
- Who?

16:03.356 --> 16:05.064
Your landlord?

16:05.234 --> 16:09.731
Oh, yeah. Brian, he moved back
to Idaho a few days ago.

16:09.906 --> 16:13.608
- And he took all his stuff with him.
- So you have your place back?

16:13.786 --> 16:17.323
- He offered it to me. Yeah.
- Good, good.

16:17.500 --> 16:21.120
- I mean, all my stuff's there, so...
- It'll be nice to sleep in a bed again.

16:21.297 --> 16:23.005
Yeah.

16:23.175 --> 16:25.214
But...

16:25.386 --> 16:28.056
Thanks for the hospitality.

16:28.223 --> 16:32.851
Except, of course, for that
Croatian lamb gruel stuff.

16:33.021 --> 16:37.436
- It's not gruel. It's called jujenca juha.
- It's a gastrointestinal adventure.

16:39.572 --> 16:43.867
Take your time. I mean, if you want
to make sure that he is gone for good.

16:44.036 --> 16:46.195
- I've mooched off you long enough.
- Dr. Greene!

16:46.372 --> 16:50.538
- Okay, you need to sit still.
- Mr. Ervin, how is the junk business?

16:50.711 --> 16:54.461
- I'm having some trouble with my feet.
- But he refuses to take off his shoes.

16:54.633 --> 16:57.552
- I don't know her.
- Dr. Chen. She's very capable.

16:57.721 --> 16:59.762
- She touched my cart.
- Don't touch Al's cart.

16:59.932 --> 17:02.935
- I moved it 2 feet.
- Okay, meet Dr. Pratt.

17:03.103 --> 17:04.384
- Hello.
- Hey.

17:04.564 --> 17:06.106
What's the trouble?

17:06.275 --> 17:08.599
The ghouls put spikes in my sneakers.

17:08.777 --> 17:10.356
The ghouls?

17:10.531 --> 17:13.319
The ones from the burned jeep
or the ones that roam rooftops?

17:13.492 --> 17:15.153
There are new ghouls.

17:15.662 --> 17:17.820
Everywhere.

17:18.708 --> 17:20.832
- Psych consult.
- Screw you, Junior.

17:21.002 --> 17:24.917
Take it easy, Al. Take off
your shoes so we can look, okay?

17:25.090 --> 17:26.253
Okay.

17:26.426 --> 17:29.844
Let Dr. Chen help you.
I'll be back in a minute.

17:31.099 --> 17:34.517
It's not a good idea to openly
show disdain for our frequent flyers.

17:34.688 --> 17:37.061
He sees ghouls.
What's wrong with a Psych consult?

17:37.233 --> 17:39.939
- A little help?
- All right, go back in there. Try it again.

17:40.112 --> 17:42.401
- Freddy Harrison. Looks about 30.
- He's 28.

17:42.573 --> 17:45.611
- No, I'll hang with you.
- Grab his old chart and get a history.

17:45.786 --> 17:48.243
Carter said I should get my hands dirty.

17:48.373 --> 17:49.453
Go.

17:49.834 --> 17:51.032
- Go.
- Found down an alley...

17:51.168 --> 17:53.495
...with agonal respiration
and pinpoint pupils.

17:53.672 --> 17:55.749
- You shooting up?
- We're in rehab. He's clean.

17:55.925 --> 17:59.342
- Hey, Dr. Greene, I got this.
- I'm already on it. One, two, three.

18:00.056 --> 18:02.215
Gave 2 of Narcan down the ET
with no response.

18:02.351 --> 18:04.889
- I'll cover this.
- You've listened to Weaver...

18:05.063 --> 18:07.934
...now back off. CBC,
chem panel, tox screen,

18:08.024 --> 18:09.519
Foley and a portable chest.

18:09.693 --> 18:12.186
- You're ruining his clothes.
- We're trying to help him.

18:12.364 --> 18:14.357
Okay, step back. You're in the way.

18:14.533 --> 18:17.239
- Whoa. Narcan is working.
- You want some Ativan?

18:17.413 --> 18:19.240
And some Pavulon.
Check the ET tube.

18:19.415 --> 18:21.409
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Freddy.

18:21.585 --> 18:23.874
- Oh, Freddy, lie back down.
- Freddy, you're okay.

18:24.047 --> 18:27.417
- I thought you was dead.
- I want my wallet. Give me my wallet.

18:27.593 --> 18:30.548
- We need to take care of you.
- Don't touch me. I want my wallet.

18:30.722 --> 18:33.510
- Maybe it fell in the parking lot.
- Abby, call Security.

18:33.684 --> 18:35.974
He wants his stuff.
You people, you're crooks.

18:36.146 --> 18:38.852
- You know you are.
- Carter, I need your help.

18:39.066 --> 18:42.235
- You know you stole his things.
- Freddy, come back. You're bleeding.

18:42.905 --> 18:44.317
- Oh, God!
- I'm sorry.

18:44.491 --> 18:46.033
Son of a bitch!

18:46.201 --> 18:48.871
- It was an accident.
- Hey, hey, break it up.

18:49.039 --> 18:50.617
- You okay?
- Give me a hand here.

18:50.791 --> 18:53.912
- My baby's coming out!
- Just try and breathe slowly. Don't push.

18:54.087 --> 18:56.246
- Oh, God!
- Keep breathing. Keep breathing.

18:56.423 --> 18:59.591
Get the gurney. CBC, Chem-7.
Get an ultrasound.

18:59.761 --> 19:02.336
- Looks like I missed the fun.
- Chest is clear.

19:02.515 --> 19:04.093
- She break her water?
- I don't know.

19:04.268 --> 19:05.727
Set up the SonoSite.

19:05.895 --> 19:08.980
- Why is the floor wet?
- Because this window leaks.

19:09.150 --> 19:12.602
- Diffusely tender with guarding.
- Did they sedate that maniac?

19:12.779 --> 19:15.900
Didn't have to. He passed out
and smashed his face.

19:16.075 --> 19:18.863
- Pressure's only 80.
- Oh, man. Okay.

19:18.996 --> 19:21.322
Let's type and cross for four.
And get some O-neg.

19:21.499 --> 19:23.292
It hurts! It hurts!

19:23.460 --> 19:25.418
- How far along are you?
- What?

19:25.797 --> 19:28.965
- When are you due?
- I don't know.

19:29.760 --> 19:33.178
- She's having contractions.
- Okay, get a fetal monitor.

19:34.726 --> 19:36.885
- How big?
- It looks like about 28 weeks.

19:37.062 --> 19:41.143
Okay, terbutaline,.25, sub-Q.
And mix the mag.

19:41.318 --> 19:45.862
No evidence of previa. Call OB. She may
need a crash section if she's abrupting.

19:47.326 --> 19:49.319
Pulse ox, 85.

19:49.496 --> 19:51.822
- No, bag him.
- Midface fractures?

19:51.999 --> 19:54.871
I can't see the cords.
You want to give this a shot?

19:55.045 --> 19:58.332
Set up the fiberoptic scope
and prep the neck for a crike.

19:58.507 --> 20:01.877
She's crowning. It's coming now.

20:02.054 --> 20:05.840
- Don't push. Just breathe.
- I can't! I can't stop!

20:06.018 --> 20:08.225
Don't push.

20:08.605 --> 20:12.686
Okay. Bulb suction, clamp.

20:15.906 --> 20:18.065
Call the NICU.

20:23.541 --> 20:26.329
2.5 ET tube.

20:26.837 --> 20:29.164
- And draw up. 02 of epi.
- Is that my baby?

20:30.175 --> 20:32.216
Come on, breathe, little guy.

20:32.387 --> 20:34.510
- Why isn't he breathing?
- He's very sick.

20:35.391 --> 20:37.265
I want to see my baby.

20:37.853 --> 20:39.727
Bag him.

20:41.023 --> 20:44.359
Pulse is 50. Starting compressions.

20:45.363 --> 20:47.023
My beautiful boy.

20:48.242 --> 20:49.274
What's the Apgar?

20:49.410 --> 20:51.902
One for heart rate,
zero for color, respirations.

20:52.081 --> 20:55.082
- Let me go see my baby!
- Not right now.

20:56.461 --> 21:00.247
- Shane, what kind of drugs you using?
- I'm not.

21:01.051 --> 21:04.587
If you want us to help your baby,
you have to tell us if you're using heroin.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.093
I don't do that anymore.

21:06.308 --> 21:08.597
- Cocaine? Crack?
- No, nothing.

21:08.769 --> 21:13.600
- Damn it, there's blood in the airway!
- Baby's pinking up. Heart rate's 120.

21:17.615 --> 21:20.023
Start working on the umbilical line.

21:26.627 --> 21:28.621
You all right?

21:33.094 --> 21:36.215
- No, too much blood. I can't get this.
- He's bradying down.

21:36.390 --> 21:38.633
- All right, let's do the crike.
- Amp of atropine.

21:38.811 --> 21:41.137
He needs an airway
unless you want to give a shot.

21:41.314 --> 21:45.229
Let me just take a quick look,
and then you can cut.

21:48.281 --> 21:50.821
- I thought you were right-handed.
- I'm a switch hitter.

21:50.993 --> 21:53.829
I need you to advance the tube
when I say so.

21:56.835 --> 21:59.457
- Ready?
- Here we go.

22:02.634 --> 22:05.173
- Run of five.
- Hundred of lidocaine.

22:05.346 --> 22:07.673
- Damn it.
- Let's do the crike.

22:07.850 --> 22:10.555
No, here we go. There, there.
Go. Advance the tube, Carter.

22:10.728 --> 22:12.353
Go, go, go.

22:20.658 --> 22:21.857
Good breath sounds.

22:21.994 --> 22:24.320
- Sats are coming up.
- That's nice.

22:24.498 --> 22:25.577
- Lucky.
- Very nice.

22:25.749 --> 22:28.704
Let's get a post-intubation film,
head and facial CT to follow.

22:28.879 --> 22:31.797
- Five-minute Apgar is six.
- Better.

22:31.965 --> 22:35.087
Dr. Greene, mom's tox screen.

22:35.261 --> 22:38.383
Shane, we're taking your baby
up to the Intensive Care Unit.

22:38.558 --> 22:40.386
- I want to stay with him.
- Take him up.

22:40.561 --> 22:44.691
- No, you're stealing my baby.
- Shane, let us take care of him.

22:44.858 --> 22:48.275
You'll keep him. You won't
bring him back. I love him!

22:48.447 --> 22:50.404
You almost killed him.

22:51.784 --> 22:54.573
- That's not what I wanted.
- Your urine's positive for opiates.

22:54.746 --> 22:57.072
You shoot up.
You've never been to a doctor.

22:57.209 --> 22:59.118
- But I was going to.
- After seven months?

22:59.252 --> 23:01.923
Are you too strung-out
to know you're pregnant?

23:02.049 --> 23:05.085
- Dr. Greene?
- I've been stressed out.

23:05.260 --> 23:07.835
Well, that explains why
you've been using cocaine too.

23:08.015 --> 23:11.467
Don't tell me you haven't been drinking.
Your blood-alcohol level is 54.

23:11.644 --> 23:14.812
- I had a beer last night.
- You've been lying to us.

23:14.982 --> 23:18.269
- I want to see my baby!
- You want to see him? There he is. Look.

23:18.446 --> 23:20.937
Premature. A third of the weight
of what he should be.

23:21.116 --> 23:23.952
If he's lucky enough not to have
brain damage from the coke...

23:24.120 --> 23:27.038
...he's still gonna suffer from
fetal alcohol syndrome-

23:27.207 --> 23:29.284
- No! Please, stop it!
- Developmental delays.

23:29.460 --> 23:31.999
Next time you see him
he's not gonna look any better...

23:32.172 --> 23:34.925
...because he's gonna be suffering
from heroin withdrawal.

23:35.093 --> 23:37.216
Just stop it!

23:38.139 --> 23:41.176
Congratulations, you're a mother.

23:43.104 --> 23:46.347
- Can you take the baby up?
- Yeah.

23:48.070 --> 23:50.229
You a basketball fan?

23:50.406 --> 23:54.321
- I saw you playing from my window.
- Try and hit it the first time, Marni.

23:54.494 --> 23:58.991
- Doctors are the worst patients.
- So I hear.

23:59.166 --> 24:03.794
I took my grandson to see
his first Bulls game last week.

24:03.963 --> 24:06.751
They're not what they used to be.

24:06.925 --> 24:10.377
He fell asleep at halftime,
but I think he enjoyed it.

24:10.555 --> 24:14.884
That's okay. Their guards
fall asleep all the time.

24:15.310 --> 24:19.390
- We'll let that infuse.
- Twenty minutes, I know.

24:57.108 --> 24:59.350
- It's the ER on line two.
- Dr. Weaver?

24:59.528 --> 25:01.650
Someone named Pratt.

25:02.698 --> 25:06.150
Pratt, I'm with a patient
right now. I can't talk.

25:06.327 --> 25:07.869
- What?
- He's bradying down.

25:08.037 --> 25:10.789
- I don't know what's happened.
- I'll be right there.

25:12.208 --> 25:14.961
Marni, can you send someone down
with the vincristine?

25:15.128 --> 25:16.160
- Dr. Greene.
- Marni.

25:16.338 --> 25:20.087
- We don't do house calls.
- I am not going home.

25:22.971 --> 25:26.388
Excuse me. Excuse me. Thanks.

25:33.524 --> 25:35.103
What happened?

25:35.277 --> 25:37.850
He barfed on Pratt's shoes
and passed out.

25:38.030 --> 25:40.735
- Dr. Greene, where were you?
- We didn't want to call you...

25:40.908 --> 25:42.486
...but he wouldn't calm down.

25:42.660 --> 25:45.615
- Sorry.
- Oh, here you go.

25:46.373 --> 25:48.116
- Don't go too far.
- Thanks.

25:48.250 --> 25:50.539
- What's that for?
- Reduce my blood alcohol.

25:50.711 --> 25:53.000
- No luck with the IV.
- Right saphenous.

25:53.130 --> 25:56.085
- What?
- It's the only one that's not sclerosed.

25:56.259 --> 25:59.177
- You want to get it, Carter?
- No, Pratt's got it.

26:00.014 --> 26:02.505
Accu-Chek's through the roof.

26:02.683 --> 26:07.262
- Did you take your insulin, Al?
- There's so much to remember.

26:07.731 --> 26:11.349
- He's diabetic?
- It's news to me. Line's in.

26:11.526 --> 26:14.197
It shouldn't be news to you.
Did you get a good history?

26:14.363 --> 26:16.937
I am a glorious history.

26:17.117 --> 26:20.237
- I told you to get his old chart.
- So what was that, like a test?

26:20.871 --> 26:24.537
Make sure he flushes all three lumens.
Don't give him an air embolus.

26:25.376 --> 26:27.583
- CBC, Chem-21 and a urine.
- He's good.

26:27.754 --> 26:30.210
Sats are 90, pulse is 110.
Dr. Greene?

26:30.548 --> 26:35.544
Add a hemoglobin, A1 C, serum ketones,
blood cultures and 12-lead.

26:35.721 --> 26:37.595
Liter up, good 18 in the right foot.

26:37.765 --> 26:41.182
Add 40 of K in the liter,
intubation tray, 8-0 ET tube.

26:41.353 --> 26:44.058
- Why? What's that for?
- Sats are dropping.

26:44.231 --> 26:45.975
Come on, Al, breathe.

26:47.235 --> 26:49.393
Carter, get ready to bag him.

26:49.904 --> 26:51.980
- Do the Sellick.
- The what?

26:52.157 --> 26:54.315
The Sellick. Give me your hand.

27:01.459 --> 27:03.417
Okay. Okay.

27:03.586 --> 27:06.588
When his blood sugar's over 700,
sometimes he stops breathing.

27:06.757 --> 27:08.086
Thanks for mentioning that.

27:08.259 --> 27:13.052
Give him 10 of regular, IV push.
Start him on 8 units per hour. Dr. Pratt.

27:14.432 --> 27:16.639
Dr. Greene.

27:18.145 --> 27:19.853
Thanks.

27:21.608 --> 27:24.443
- You could've told me he was diabetic.
- I said to work him up.

27:24.611 --> 27:26.485
I was looking
for chronic athlete's foot.

27:26.655 --> 27:29.573
You missed the DKA
because you didn't follow instructions.

27:29.700 --> 27:33.283
- It didn't seem necessary.
- That assessment is up to me. Okay?

27:33.454 --> 27:35.661
You do the learning,
I'll do the teaching.

27:35.832 --> 27:37.706
- Do I seem like a punk to you?
- No.

27:37.876 --> 27:39.620
Then stop trying to treat me like one.

27:39.795 --> 27:42.334
I'm sure that you think
that you're ready for anything.

27:42.506 --> 27:45.378
Wait. Is this the one about
the old guy and the young guy?

27:45.552 --> 27:49.764
- Because, see, I've heard it all before.
- There's a door there that goes outside.

27:49.932 --> 27:53.384
If you don't like the way
I'm doing this, keep walking.

27:56.606 --> 27:59.394
- He's a good doctor.
- He's a burnout if I ever saw one.

27:59.568 --> 28:02.688
- I learned a lot from him.
- If I had my call, I'd stick with you.

28:02.863 --> 28:05.152
- You don't.
- You saw him in there.

28:05.324 --> 28:07.898
I just can't figure out
what's going on with this guy.

28:08.369 --> 28:10.243
A tumor.

28:10.414 --> 28:12.323
- What?
- He has a brain tumor.

28:12.499 --> 28:16.580
An inoperable GBM that's recurred.
That's what's going on with him.

28:16.754 --> 28:19.756
- That's what the IV's for.
- He's in his second cycle of chemo.

28:19.924 --> 28:22.167
- And he's still working?
- Everything okay?

28:22.344 --> 28:23.803
- Yeah.
- Yeah, Pratt was just saying...

28:23.929 --> 28:26.254
...how much he's benefiting
from Dr. Greene.

28:26.432 --> 28:28.722
He's a good teacher.

28:28.893 --> 28:31.680
You could start feeding me
this information a little earlier.

28:31.855 --> 28:34.097
- Labs back for Seidel.
- Thanks.

28:34.608 --> 28:36.981
His PSA's higher than his Alk Phos.

28:37.069 --> 28:39.062
Six hundred? Did you call his doctor?

28:39.239 --> 28:42.193
Left three messages on his service
before I got the cell number.

28:42.367 --> 28:44.407
- Son of a bitch.
- What do you think? He knew?

28:44.578 --> 28:46.037
He should have.

28:46.205 --> 28:49.870
This guy shouldn't have to find out
from doctors he's never met in the ER.

28:50.042 --> 28:53.743
Hey, listen,
in med school I was a hotshot.

28:53.922 --> 28:56.627
And I forgot I'm not one here.
Well, not yet at least.

28:56.800 --> 28:58.959
Like I said, no rush.

28:59.136 --> 29:02.921
- Hello?
- Hi. Yeah, is your father there?

29:03.100 --> 29:06.385
- This is Dr. Greene from the County ER.
- Hold on.

29:06.561 --> 29:10.773
Listen,
I didn't mean any disrespect earlier.

29:11.776 --> 29:14.563
- Someone told you I'm dying.
- Dr. Greene, is it?

29:14.738 --> 29:17.941
- Yeah.
- Call my office. I'm not taking any calls.

29:18.116 --> 29:22.744
I understand you' re on vacation.
Your patient's PSA set a record high.

29:22.914 --> 29:24.492
Oh, well, how can I be of help?

29:24.666 --> 29:27.537
Well, for starters, when was
the last time you examined him?

29:27.711 --> 29:29.503
- About two years, I'd say.
- Two years?

29:29.671 --> 29:34.299
- Have you made a diagnosis?
- In fact, yes. Metastatic prostate cancer.

29:34.469 --> 29:36.378
Really? I never saw any indication.

29:36.554 --> 29:41.217
Well, the huge irregular mass on his
enlarged prostate may have been a clue.

29:41.393 --> 29:43.884
You want me
to put him on the phone?

29:44.063 --> 29:48.560
Why don't you put down your hot cocoa,
and get your ass on a plane to Chicago-

29:49.277 --> 29:50.558
He hung up.

29:50.738 --> 29:53.311
- Very persuasive.
- I try.

29:53.491 --> 29:58.616
- Should we tell him?
- Let him sleep. Call Urology for a bed.

30:00.957 --> 30:04.042
I panicked. Okay? You weren't here,
and I didn't know what to do.

30:04.212 --> 30:07.165
- You knew this wasn't what she wanted.
- You're extubating?

30:07.340 --> 30:10.175
You should have never
intubated her in the first place.

30:10.344 --> 30:12.585
- What about the obstructions?
- It's a mild ileus.

30:12.762 --> 30:15.764
I don't care what it is.
I have durable power of attorney.

30:15.933 --> 30:19.718
And we want to take our mother
home now. Get that line out of her.

30:19.896 --> 30:22.304
You may wanna leave that in,
in case she needs fluid.

30:22.482 --> 30:25.353
Don't you get it? She wants to die.

30:25.527 --> 30:30.356
You people can't accept that.
It's like a defeat to you.

30:31.827 --> 30:34.033
Do you have the DNR?

30:45.301 --> 30:47.175
Okay.

30:50.473 --> 30:51.671
Pull it.

31:06.574 --> 31:09.611
- Just at the bed right around the corner.
- All right.

31:09.787 --> 31:11.198
What's this about?

31:11.372 --> 31:15.746
I got called down from Oncology,
so the nurse is here with my vincristine.

31:16.545 --> 31:21.290
- You sure you're feeling all right?
- Wish people would stop asking me that.

31:22.968 --> 31:26.172
Could you unplug her and let them go?

31:26.348 --> 31:27.890
Yeah, sure.

31:30.310 --> 31:32.636
Dr. Greene, I want my cart.

31:32.813 --> 31:36.016
- What?
- They threw my cart outside.

31:36.192 --> 31:38.565
- Ready?
- Sure.

31:38.737 --> 31:43.067
I want my cart.
I always have it with me.

31:43.242 --> 31:46.943
It's okay, Al. I'm right here.
Everything's gonna be all right.

31:47.122 --> 31:49.909
I almost had to call
an Oncology staff meeting.

31:50.250 --> 31:52.492
They weren't crazy
about my doing this down here.

31:52.670 --> 31:56.419
Please, I want my cart.

31:56.590 --> 31:59.296
Give me my cart!

31:59.469 --> 32:02.091
These new needle-less systems
are a pain.

32:03.223 --> 32:06.723
Give me my cart.

32:09.105 --> 32:13.103
- You know what? I'm not doing this.
- I can't come back.

32:13.276 --> 32:16.361
- You don't have to. I'm done.
- Please!

32:16.531 --> 32:18.606
- Dr. Greene...
- I want my cart.

32:18.782 --> 32:22.828
Al, let me help you find your cart.

32:23.455 --> 32:26.387
Thank you. Thank you.

32:27.093 --> 32:30.094
Aspergilloma is what people
used to superstitiously take...

32:30.264 --> 32:32.091
...as the curse of the mummy.

32:32.266 --> 32:35.470
I'll never hear the end of this at work.
How did I get it?

32:35.938 --> 32:38.429
You went to Egypt recently
on an excavation, right?

32:38.775 --> 32:43.237
Pulmonology will bronch her.
Give her 200 of itra-

32:46.118 --> 32:50.615
Itraconazole, BID, will help
with the oral steroids.

32:50.790 --> 32:55.121
- I work too much, that's why I'm sick.
- You'll be okay soon.

32:55.296 --> 32:57.538
You know that song,
"Don't it always seem to go...

32:57.716 --> 33:00.124
...that you don't know
what you got till it's gone? "

33:00.302 --> 33:02.795
- Joni Mitchell.
- Story of my life.

33:02.973 --> 33:05.180
I hate that song.

33:08.063 --> 33:09.641
Mark.

33:13.153 --> 33:15.645
I spoke with Oncology.
I told them you'd be up soon.

33:15.823 --> 33:18.576
- You shouldn't have.
- They're holding a room for you.

33:18.743 --> 33:20.867
I'm finished. I've had enough.

33:21.038 --> 33:23.577
You can go up now,
and I'll drive you home.

33:23.750 --> 33:24.995
Elizabeth.

33:25.169 --> 33:29.463
This isn't something that you decide
by yourself on the spur of the moment.

33:29.633 --> 33:32.836
This might be the last
important decision I get to make.

33:33.012 --> 33:36.014
You haven't given it time
to work, Mark. Please.

33:36.182 --> 33:39.350
I dropped an ET tube today.
I couldn't wrap my thumb around it.

33:39.520 --> 33:41.348
That doesn't mean
the chemo's not working.

33:41.523 --> 33:43.849
It's a game, Elizabeth.
I don't wanna play.

33:44.026 --> 33:48.357
Look, it's only the second cycle.
This treatment could prolong your life.

33:48.533 --> 33:51.451
Maybe. For a couple of months.

33:54.373 --> 33:59.036
Well, then give yourself that time.
Give it to me and Ella.

33:59.714 --> 34:03.214
Give it to Rachel.
Who knows what might happen?

34:03.886 --> 34:05.511
We see patients here every day...

34:05.679 --> 34:08.598
...who are told that
they should have been dead long ago.

34:09.184 --> 34:10.929
I need to be realistic.

34:11.813 --> 34:16.891
- You mean give up.
- It's not giving up. It's making a choice.

34:18.154 --> 34:23.495
I'd rather have two good months
than twice that chained to meds...

34:23.661 --> 34:28.657
...and needles and IV stands,
stuck in a bed...

34:29.628 --> 34:33.757
...sitting next to other clock-watchers,
being prodded and small-talked to...

34:33.925 --> 34:39.799
...by doctors and nurses,
all of them with that look in their eye...

34:40.433 --> 34:43.139
...like you're already gone.

34:44.522 --> 34:47.192
I don't want to end it like that.

34:48.444 --> 34:52.609
Look, we can look into
some new regimens.

34:52.782 --> 34:57.945
We can find some alternative therapies
that we haven't heard about.

34:59.125 --> 35:01.581
Mr. Seidel is awake.

35:02.462 --> 35:04.455
I'll be right there.

35:04.840 --> 35:06.833
Please?

35:08.554 --> 35:11.223
There's no alternative.

35:11.391 --> 35:14.309
Just dying the way I've lived.

35:26.368 --> 35:28.907
I'll see you at home.

35:29.539 --> 35:31.663
I love you.

35:45.351 --> 35:47.510
- You ready?
- I can do it.

35:47.687 --> 35:52.233
- Not the easiest news to give someone.
- I know the job.

35:56.199 --> 35:57.610
Mr. Seidel.

35:57.785 --> 36:02.531
My old lady's waiting with my daughter,
so can we get this over with?

36:04.168 --> 36:07.870
Your presentation is consistent
with metastatic cancer of the prostate.

36:09.550 --> 36:11.543
Cancer?

36:11.719 --> 36:13.427
Are you sure?
Maybe you got it wrong.

36:13.597 --> 36:15.804
Allanson never said anything
about cancer.

36:15.975 --> 36:18.015
He may have overlooked it.

36:18.186 --> 36:21.437
He always acted
like I was a hypochondriac.

36:21.899 --> 36:23.892
He should have caught it.

36:24.068 --> 36:26.905
Maybe we should call your wife
before we explain everything.

36:27.073 --> 36:29.778
Tell me, is it bad?

36:29.951 --> 36:32.407
Possibly, it could be.

36:32.580 --> 36:38.086
What? Do I need chemotherapy
or an operation or what?

36:40.966 --> 36:43.802
I mean,
it's not like I'm gonna die, right?

36:46.014 --> 36:48.422
I could die?

36:51.980 --> 36:56.939
We need to admit you for tests.
The cancer appears to be very advanced.

36:57.779 --> 37:00.946
You need to prepare yourself
for the worst.

37:04.037 --> 37:05.911
I know what a shock this is...

37:06.666 --> 37:09.335
...and what must be going through
your mind right now.

37:09.711 --> 37:11.372
You can't.

37:12.131 --> 37:14.623
Yeah, I can.

37:16.971 --> 37:18.845
I'll call his family.

37:42.212 --> 37:45.333
- Go in and sit with him.
- What did you say to him?

37:45.508 --> 37:48.083
Wasn't anything I learned
from being a doctor.

37:48.262 --> 37:50.836
No, no, no, we need
to keep that in. Okay?

37:51.015 --> 37:54.516
- I want to go.
- It's wet out there. It's raining.

37:54.686 --> 37:58.021
- It stopped. I don't want to be here.
- Me either.

37:58.192 --> 38:02.025
- When can you get him upstairs?
- Oh, I'll call the Telemetry Unit.

38:02.197 --> 38:04.356
- Last serum ketones?
- Still positive.

38:04.533 --> 38:06.657
- Urine?
-200 cc's in the last hour.

38:06.827 --> 38:09.498
I'll take it out. You know I know how.

38:09.664 --> 38:14.244
Al, it's gonna become harder for you
to be able to take care of yourself.

38:15.213 --> 38:19.876
- Do you have any family you can go to?
- No. There's nobody.

38:20.053 --> 38:23.055
- Then let me admit you.
- You know I don't like this place.

38:23.223 --> 38:25.466
I don't belong here.

38:25.644 --> 38:31.316
Whatever's going to happen,
I want it to happen outside.

38:32.236 --> 38:34.479
Please.

38:37.868 --> 38:39.861
Okay.

38:40.037 --> 38:42.612
It'll be over soon.

38:42.791 --> 38:46.411
- Right?
- Yeah, it will.

38:46.588 --> 38:49.839
How much longer
do I have to sit here?

38:50.009 --> 38:54.091
- Ms. Raskin, it's been a long time.
- The service isn't what it used to be.

38:54.264 --> 38:58.595
- What's the trouble?
- I have this hangnail, it is very painful.

38:58.770 --> 39:01.642
I have a brain tumor,
and it's inoperable.

39:02.275 --> 39:04.268
- What?
- I win.

39:04.695 --> 39:08.611
Excuse me, can somebody
please see my daughter?

39:09.201 --> 39:14.030
- A nurse will be right with you.
- I've been here for over two hours.

39:15.875 --> 39:17.252
- I'm Dr. Greene.
- Hi, doctor.

39:17.419 --> 39:21.288
- No, it'll hurt, Daddy.
- Oh, what will hurt?

39:21.466 --> 39:23.507
Katie's class mythology project.

39:23.677 --> 39:26.430
Why they let kids play
with wooden spears, I'll never know.

39:26.599 --> 39:29.517
I like your outfit.
Can I put you up here?

39:30.353 --> 39:32.560
- There.
- It hurts.

39:32.732 --> 39:35.270
I know. I'll be gentle.

39:35.485 --> 39:39.021
It's up under the nail.
She won't even let me near it.

39:39.907 --> 39:41.782
Can I look?

39:41.951 --> 39:46.829
- I don't want a shot.
- No, no, no shots. I promise.

39:47.709 --> 39:49.204
Let's play a game.

39:49.419 --> 39:52.540
- Close your eyes, okay?
- Okay.

39:55.177 --> 39:58.512
- What do you see?
- The sky.

39:58.682 --> 40:01.173
- What's up there?
- Orion's Belt.

40:02.269 --> 40:04.940
- Orion's?
- He couldn't beat the scorpion.

40:05.106 --> 40:08.524
- So he jumped into the sea.
- Really?

40:08.695 --> 40:12.195
Artemis put him in the sky,
where the scorpion never gets him.

40:13.910 --> 40:16.235
I didn't know that.

40:17.206 --> 40:20.872
- There. That didn't hurt, did it?
- Is it over?

40:21.921 --> 40:24.210
It's all done.

40:24.382 --> 40:27.550
- Thank you, Katie.
- What did I do?

40:28.846 --> 40:32.715
You just became my very last patient.

40:34.728 --> 40:37.896
- Your shift over?
- Yeah.

40:38.066 --> 40:39.894
Thank you.

40:40.861 --> 40:43.733
Haleh, can you give that
hangnail lady a cast shoe...

40:43.908 --> 40:46.233
...sign her out
and tell her to never come back?

40:46.410 --> 40:48.617
If you say so.

40:52.585 --> 40:56.205
Dr. Greene, I set up Seidel for the
biopsy, and his family's on the way in.

40:56.382 --> 40:57.627
Okay.

40:57.801 --> 41:01.004
Hey, I just wanted to say,
you know, I learned a lot today.

41:01.180 --> 41:04.431
Good. Come back tomorrow.

41:08.606 --> 41:10.896
How's Pratt doing?

41:11.067 --> 41:13.690
A little eager, a little cocky.

41:16.658 --> 41:19.067
He should fit right in.

41:19.245 --> 41:23.196
Think he'd want to take on
some extra shifts?

41:24.252 --> 41:26.459
Pretty safe bet.

41:27.506 --> 41:29.713
What about you?

41:32.513 --> 41:33.841
Me?

41:36.601 --> 41:39.389
How many shifts
should I put you down for next month?

41:48.325 --> 41:52.075
Never let your work
become your life, Kerry.

41:54.375 --> 41:56.498
Live a little.

41:59.172 --> 42:02.174
No rest for the weary, Carter.

42:02.343 --> 42:04.716
I've been on since 4 a. m.

42:04.888 --> 42:07.675
- You leaving early?
- Not early enough.

42:07.850 --> 42:10.769
Fisher in the hall's an alcoholic.
Knocked himself out.

42:10.937 --> 42:14.522
Check a head CT and road-test him
before you let him go.

42:20.576 --> 42:24.159
- Withdrawal?
- Just your usual midweek party.

42:24.330 --> 42:28.163
Chakarova has hives.
Got prednisone, Benadryl.

42:28.335 --> 42:31.586
Feeling better.
Watch her for half an hour.

42:31.757 --> 42:33.915
Send her on her way. Dispo's written.

42:34.468 --> 42:37.256
- Anybody actually sick?
- Just the doctor.

42:44.314 --> 42:47.482
Hey, did you see the guy in 3?

42:47.652 --> 42:51.485
Pacio, 56-year-old, chest pain.
Ruled out going to Medicine.

42:51.657 --> 42:54.232
Got aspirin, beta-blockers,
heparin and an Ace.

42:54.411 --> 42:56.985
28-year-old girl. LOC.
Fell through a plate-glass window.

42:57.165 --> 43:00.748
- Just keep pressure on that dressing.
- Bleeder in the left arm is the worst.

43:00.920 --> 43:02.580
Good night, Dr. Greene.

43:02.755 --> 43:05.211
- BP, 100/70.
- Bye.

43:14.437 --> 43:16.477
So EKG for Pacio?

43:16.648 --> 43:20.943
Flip T's in lateral leads.
X- ray's clear.

43:21.572 --> 43:25.273
Check his troponin
and repeat EKG in 10 minutes.

43:26.286 --> 43:28.956
- It stopped raining.
- Yeah.

43:29.499 --> 43:32.951
Clear sky. I'm out of here.

43:33.128 --> 43:35.086
You on tomorrow?

43:37.801 --> 43:39.924
Your ball needs air.

43:40.096 --> 43:42.135
It's not my ball.

43:43.349 --> 43:45.806
You set the tone, Carter.

43:45.978 --> 43:48.517
What?

43:48.690 --> 43:50.893
Work on your jump shot.

44:27.863 --> 44:30.933
