WEBVTT

00:01.836 --> 00:03.002
[cutlery clanking]

00:04.305 --> 00:08.674
Once again, Kate,
excellent meat loaf.

00:08.676 --> 00:11.710
Once again, Kate, meat loaf.

00:11.712 --> 00:15.681
Uh, for your information,
that was Salisbury steak.

00:15.683 --> 00:19.018
Great. Meat loaf
with an attitude.

00:19.020 --> 00:20.953
(Jake)
'Knock, knock!'

00:20.955 --> 00:23.689
Door's open, Jake.

00:23.691 --> 00:25.824
- Oh, hi, guys.
- Hey, Jake!

00:25.826 --> 00:29.495
You're just in time
for brandy and cigars.

00:29.497 --> 00:32.064
No brandy, no cigars.

00:32.066 --> 00:33.966
Philistine.

00:33.968 --> 00:35.434
But I can't stay anyway.

00:35.436 --> 00:38.537
Aunt Raquel wants to know
if you got any fresh fennel.

00:38.539 --> 00:41.807
Uncle Trevor hates the dry kind.

00:41.809 --> 00:45.377
I'm afraid we're fresh out
of f-fresh fennel.

00:45.379 --> 00:47.513
Well, I tried.
Thanks anyway. Bye.

00:47.515 --> 00:50.015
- Hey, where you off to?
- Home.

00:50.017 --> 00:53.018
Well, we haven't seen you around
here for quite a while.

00:53.020 --> 00:55.287
Yeah, well, uh,
someone's been stayin'

00:55.289 --> 00:57.456
in our house
for a couple of days.

00:57.458 --> 00:59.591
Willingly?

00:59.593 --> 01:01.060
ALF.

01:01.062 --> 01:02.394
A relative?

01:02.396 --> 01:04.663
Hm, sort of, uh..

01:04.665 --> 01:07.232
- She's my mother.
- Mm.

01:07.234 --> 01:09.201
You have a mother?

01:09.203 --> 01:11.403
I'm a mammal, aren't I?

01:11.405 --> 01:12.971
What ALF is trying to say
is that

01:12.973 --> 01:14.807
you've never mentioned
your mother before.

01:14.809 --> 01:17.576
Yeah, we figured she was dead.

01:17.578 --> 01:19.745
What Brian
is trying to say is that

01:19.747 --> 01:21.346
since you live
with your aunt and uncle

01:21.348 --> 01:24.049
we thought your mother
might perhaps be

01:24.051 --> 01:26.285
well, you know..

01:26.287 --> 01:27.586
Dead!

01:28.856 --> 01:31.857
[theme music]

01:59.687 --> 02:02.888
[music continues]

02:30.484 --> 02:33.085
[instrumental music]

02:33.888 --> 02:35.420
Look, there must be some reason

02:35.422 --> 02:38.023
Jake never told me
about his mother.

02:38.025 --> 02:41.593
We're best friends,
blood brothers

02:41.595 --> 02:45.197
two sides of the same
Double Stuf Oreo.

02:45.199 --> 02:48.700
I think in some cultures
we'd be considered engaged.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.471
Perhaps with you around,
he found it difficult

02:52.473 --> 02:55.407
to get a word in edgewise.

02:55.409 --> 02:57.809
Hardy-har.

02:57.811 --> 03:00.646
For your information,
Jake tells me everything.

03:00.648 --> 03:02.881
About how his father's in jail

03:02.883 --> 03:05.717
about how he flunked
his last math test

03:05.719 --> 03:08.453
about how Trevor and Raquel
like to sometimes dress up

03:08.455 --> 03:10.022
like Norwegian..

03:11.659 --> 03:13.725
Never mind.

03:13.727 --> 03:14.793
[doorbell ringing]

03:14.795 --> 03:16.962
(Raquel)
'Yoo-hoo! It's Raquel!'

03:16.964 --> 03:19.565
Yoo-hoo.
Tell her we're not home.

03:19.567 --> 03:20.966
Bye, ALF.

03:20.968 --> 03:24.703
Let her in.
I'll pretend I'm a fuzzy lamp.

03:24.705 --> 03:27.272
You can pretend that
in the kitchen.

03:27.274 --> 03:29.808
Fine. Which way is the kitchen?

03:31.779 --> 03:34.580
Hey, what do you want
from a lamp?

03:40.588 --> 03:41.653
Oh, hi, Raquel.

03:41.655 --> 03:43.422
- Willie, Kate.
- Hello, Raquel.

03:43.424 --> 03:44.790
I'd like you to meet
my sister-in-law

03:44.792 --> 03:47.326
Elaine Ochmonek.
She's Jake's mother.

03:47.328 --> 03:50.495
Elaine, this is Willie Tanner
and his wife Kate.

03:50.497 --> 03:53.131
- She's pregnant.
- I see that.

03:53.133 --> 03:55.033
- Gee, it's nice to meet you.
- Nice to finally meet you.

03:55.035 --> 03:57.703
Please, come in, come in.
We are so fond of Jake.

03:57.705 --> 04:00.305
Oh, well,
he talks about his-his friends

04:00.307 --> 04:02.107
the Tanners, all the time.

04:02.109 --> 04:04.743
Although, sometimes
he does stop rather abruptly

04:04.745 --> 04:06.578
in the middle of a sentence.

04:06.580 --> 04:09.181
Well, don't we all just..

04:11.685 --> 04:14.686
Don't we all just do that
now and again?

04:16.023 --> 04:17.289
No.

04:19.760 --> 04:23.028
Uh, I really appreciate
everything you've done for Jake.

04:23.030 --> 04:24.596
It's been hard on him,
being away

04:24.598 --> 04:26.064
from all his friends
in New York.

04:26.066 --> 04:28.166
Oh, he's become
like one of the family.

04:28.168 --> 04:31.103
Maybe we can all get together
sometime while you're visiting.

04:31.105 --> 04:33.005
What a lovely idea.

04:33.007 --> 04:36.041
Say, here for dinner,
tomorrow 7:30?

04:36.043 --> 04:37.943
- Uh, well--
- 'Please..'

04:37.945 --> 04:40.245
Uh-uh-uh,
don't go to any trouble.

04:40.247 --> 04:42.347
- Oh, pish. Kate doesn't mind.
- You know..

04:42.349 --> 04:44.516
Do you, Kate?

04:44.518 --> 04:46.118
Pish?

04:46.120 --> 04:48.787
Good. Besides,
they owe us a dinner.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.622
Not that
I'm the kind of a person

04:50.624 --> 04:52.724
who would bring that up.

04:52.726 --> 04:55.761
7:30 tomorrow will be fine.

04:55.763 --> 04:58.297
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice meeting you.

04:58.299 --> 04:59.898
Buh-bye. Bye.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.166
Toodles!

05:03.737 --> 05:05.103
[door shuts]

05:09.810 --> 05:12.010
- Fuzzy lamp.
- Fuzzy lamp.

05:13.714 --> 05:16.915
[instrumental music]

05:20.688 --> 05:22.688
[sighs]
Here's the rest
of the zucchini, Trevor.

05:22.690 --> 05:24.923
Oh, thanks, Kate.

05:24.925 --> 05:27.125
Why did you say
Kate was a bad cook?

05:28.762 --> 05:30.595
Don't talk
with your mouth full, Trevor.

05:30.597 --> 05:33.365
In fact, don't talk at all.

05:34.435 --> 05:36.201
Everything is just delicious.

05:36.203 --> 05:37.336
Thank you.

05:37.338 --> 05:39.438
Well, I'm full. Shall we go?

05:39.440 --> 05:43.775
Jake, where are your manners?
We just sat down.

05:43.777 --> 05:47.612
Don't you want dessert?
Mom defrosted Sara Lee.

05:47.614 --> 05:49.314
[scoffs]
Swell.

05:51.552 --> 05:52.818
I brought your supper, ALF.

05:52.820 --> 05:55.420
I had to sneak it past
the Ochmoneks.

05:55.422 --> 05:57.556
Thank the warden for me.

05:57.558 --> 06:00.525
Come on, at least mom and dad
agreed you could stay up here

06:00.527 --> 06:02.194
instead of the garage.

06:02.196 --> 06:06.331
That's only because
the dungeon isn't finished yet.

06:06.333 --> 06:08.600
Stop complaining.

06:08.602 --> 06:10.235
How's it going down there?

06:10.237 --> 06:13.839
Fine.
Jake's mother seems very nice.

06:13.841 --> 06:16.975
- How's Jake?
- He's still acting weird.

06:16.977 --> 06:20.879
Weird? How weird?
A little weird? Medium weird?

06:20.881 --> 06:23.849
Big weird? Or Ochmonek weird?

06:24.918 --> 06:27.486
Uncomfortable weird.

06:27.488 --> 06:30.322
I knew it. She's an impostor.

06:30.324 --> 06:32.057
- Who?
- Jake's mother.

06:32.059 --> 06:33.859
She's really not his mother.

06:33.861 --> 06:36.661
She's his father!

06:36.663 --> 06:39.064
I feel another theory coming on.

06:39.066 --> 06:41.566
See, Jake's father
isn't really in jail.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.535
He's masquerading as his mother

06:43.537 --> 06:46.605
to avoid doing hard time
on the rock.

06:46.607 --> 06:50.842
Now, that sounds like it
couldn't possibly not be true.

06:50.844 --> 06:53.044
Look, if Jake really
has a mother

06:53.046 --> 06:55.981
why is he living
with his aunt and uncle?

06:55.983 --> 07:00.285
Tsk. I don't know, but I'm sure
there's a logical explanation.

07:00.287 --> 07:01.920
Well, I'm not.

07:01.922 --> 07:04.890
To quote
a famous deli owner on Melmac

07:04.892 --> 07:07.726
"Something is awry."

07:09.663 --> 07:10.862
Enjoy your dinner, ALF.

07:10.864 --> 07:12.030
If I find out anything more

07:12.032 --> 07:14.166
about Jake's mother,
I'll let you know.

07:14.168 --> 07:18.403
Don't be afraid
to ask questions. Probe.

07:18.405 --> 07:20.839
Go through his purse!

07:24.745 --> 07:26.111
Chicken.

07:27.080 --> 07:29.114
I'm sorry. I was detained.

07:29.116 --> 07:30.348
- Everything alright?
- Fine.

07:30.350 --> 07:32.784
- No problem in the attic?
- None.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.022
You got problems
with your attic?

07:37.024 --> 07:41.393
Yes. N-no..
I mean, I was, but now I'm not.

07:42.463 --> 07:45.730
Could you pass the potatoes,
please?

07:45.732 --> 07:47.332
I had pigeons in my attic once.

07:47.334 --> 07:49.034
- What a mess!
- Trevor, please.

07:49.036 --> 07:50.702
The place looked
like it was stuccoed.

07:50.704 --> 07:52.070
- Trevor, we're eating.
- I mean--

07:52.072 --> 07:55.240
What? It's not like
I'm makin' it up.

07:57.277 --> 08:00.445
So, Elaine, how long will you
be staying in California?

08:00.447 --> 08:02.514
- Mm, not long.
- 'Well..'

08:02.516 --> 08:04.816
Right, mom?

08:04.818 --> 08:06.451
I'm leavin' on Wednesday.

08:06.453 --> 08:09.788
Oh, what a shame
you can't stay longer.

08:09.790 --> 08:12.090
- Well, I--
- She can't. She-she'd love to.

08:12.092 --> 08:14.125
But she can't,
she's gotta go back

08:14.127 --> 08:16.795
to New York. She lives there.

08:16.797 --> 08:18.363
- 'Jake.'
- What?

08:18.365 --> 08:21.533
I'm sure your mother
can speak for herself.

08:21.535 --> 08:22.834
I know,
it's just that it's rude

08:22.836 --> 08:24.069
to speak
with a mouthful of food.

08:24.071 --> 08:25.537
And my mouth was empty
at the time.

08:25.539 --> 08:28.240
- So I thought that maybe--
- Cork it, eh, Jake?

08:28.242 --> 08:30.809
Kate, you got anymore
of that chicken in there?

08:31.712 --> 08:33.778
I'll check.

08:33.780 --> 08:36.248
If not, I'll take a burger.

08:38.318 --> 08:40.552
Uh, excuse me,
can I use your powder room?

08:40.554 --> 08:43.154
- Oh, certainly.
- 'Use the one off the bedroom.'

08:43.156 --> 08:45.490
The other sink is stopped up.

08:49.162 --> 08:50.795
Uh, it's just at the end
of the hall.

08:50.797 --> 08:52.330
- On the left.
- Oh, thank you.

08:52.332 --> 08:54.699
Uh, l-let me show you
where it is.

08:54.701 --> 08:57.402
I'm sure I can find it myself.

08:57.404 --> 08:58.837
Excuse me.

09:00.474 --> 09:01.540
[Jake sighs]

09:03.477 --> 09:04.910
What?

09:09.683 --> 09:11.950
Uh-oh, nature's calling

09:11.952 --> 09:14.486
and the phones are all
downstairs.

09:16.023 --> 09:18.523
Okay, ALF, just concentrate.

09:18.525 --> 09:23.395
Mind over bladder.
Mind over bladder.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.999
Bladder over mind.

09:30.304 --> 09:33.305
[comical music]

09:49.656 --> 09:52.657
[music continues]

10:05.372 --> 10:06.504
[door shuts]

10:09.142 --> 10:12.510
No wonder Jake didn't wanna
talk about his mother.

10:12.512 --> 10:14.179
She's a crook.

10:18.485 --> 10:20.485
[instrumental music]

10:22.856 --> 10:24.656
Great dessert, Kate.

10:24.658 --> 10:26.124
Thank you for a lovely dinner.

10:26.126 --> 10:28.627
Well, you're very welcome.

10:28.629 --> 10:30.495
Let's go.

10:30.497 --> 10:32.430
Wait a second, Jake.

10:32.432 --> 10:35.233
Simple items
were simply delicious, Kate.

10:35.235 --> 10:37.569
You shouldn't feel bad
about the chicken.

10:38.672 --> 10:40.605
Thank you.

10:40.607 --> 10:42.107
Let's go, come on!

10:42.109 --> 10:43.508
What's your hurry?

10:43.510 --> 10:46.044
- I got homework.
- Homework?

10:46.046 --> 10:48.113
Since when have you been
an overachiever?

10:48.115 --> 10:51.182
Cool your jets,
we're coming, alright?

10:51.184 --> 10:53.685
Well, I guess
we should be going.

10:53.687 --> 10:55.854
- Bye, Kate.
- Buh-bye.

10:55.856 --> 10:56.888
- Bye.
- Bye-Bye.

10:56.890 --> 10:59.324
Hm.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.393
What in the world
is wrong with Jake?

11:01.395 --> 11:03.528
I'm glad you've asked
that question.

11:03.530 --> 11:06.264
ALF, what are you doing
downstairs?

11:06.266 --> 11:09.134
Uh, Willie,
you're probably wondering

11:09.136 --> 11:11.302
why I've gathered you all here.

11:11.304 --> 11:13.571
That's it, from now on
when we have guests

11:13.573 --> 11:15.874
you will stay in the garage.

11:15.876 --> 11:17.275
A-ha!

11:17.277 --> 11:19.077
But if I was in the garage

11:19.079 --> 11:22.514
I wouldn't have found out
what I found out.

11:23.750 --> 11:25.583
What did you find out?

11:25.585 --> 11:27.152
I'll give you a hint.

11:27.154 --> 11:31.056
It's what I did to your hearts
the day I came here.

11:31.058 --> 11:34.092
Um, break.

11:34.094 --> 11:36.828
I said hearts, not house.

11:36.830 --> 11:39.364
Oh, stop trying to change
the subject, ALF.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.933
You know that you were supposed
to stay in the attic.

11:41.935 --> 11:44.636
I'm not trying
to change the subject.

11:44.638 --> 11:48.173
Okay, I am.
But this is really, really good!

11:48.175 --> 11:49.641
You wanna hear it?

11:49.643 --> 11:51.176
No.

11:51.178 --> 11:54.312
But it'll clear up
two mysteries at once.

11:54.314 --> 11:57.415
A, why is Jake acting so weird?

11:57.417 --> 12:01.886
And B, where is
Kate's big, red pin?

12:01.888 --> 12:03.221
You mean my garnet brooch?

12:03.223 --> 12:04.656
The one that belonged
to my grandmother?

12:04.658 --> 12:08.159
The one that looked like
a bunch of lumpy grapes.

12:08.161 --> 12:10.428
It's in my jewelry box.

12:10.430 --> 12:12.464
[imitates buzzer]
Wrong!

12:12.466 --> 12:15.333
It used to be
in your jewelry box.

12:15.335 --> 12:18.870
Now it's in
Jake's mother's pocket.

12:18.872 --> 12:23.708
Oh, ALF! Why would you say
something like that?

12:23.710 --> 12:25.443
Because it's true.

12:25.445 --> 12:28.313
I happened to be strolling
past your boudoir door

12:28.315 --> 12:31.783
while she was doing
the old five-finger fandango

12:31.785 --> 12:34.486
in your jewelry box.

12:34.488 --> 12:36.921
I'll go check.

12:36.923 --> 12:38.890
You're not kidding, are you?

12:38.892 --> 12:42.794
Trust me, the woman's a felon!

12:42.796 --> 12:45.396
You better be right about this,
you know, it's very dangerous

12:45.398 --> 12:49.234
to wrongfully accuse people
of misdeeds.

12:49.236 --> 12:53.271
Misdeeds? What are you,
writing commandments now?

12:55.108 --> 12:57.776
Do you think
Jake knows about this?

12:57.778 --> 12:59.177
Sure!

12:59.179 --> 13:00.779
Why else do you think
he's been acting like

13:00.781 --> 13:04.349
Norman Bates on Mother's Day?

13:04.351 --> 13:07.285
Is Jake's mom a crook, dad?

13:07.287 --> 13:10.355
Oh, I don't think so, B.

13:10.357 --> 13:14.058
After all, she's only
an Ochmonek by marriage.

13:14.060 --> 13:17.228
ALF's right. My brooch is gone.

13:17.230 --> 13:19.798
You doubted my veracity?

13:19.800 --> 13:21.733
That pains me.

13:23.003 --> 13:24.302
Willie, what are we gonna do?

13:24.304 --> 13:26.971
That brooch has been
in my family for so long.

13:26.973 --> 13:30.141
Well, the situation
has to be handled delicately.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.643
I'll speak to Trevor.

13:31.645 --> 13:33.645
What am I saying?

13:33.647 --> 13:36.748
Hey, hey, let me
straighten it out with Jake.

13:36.750 --> 13:39.184
I can handle it.

13:39.186 --> 13:42.120
Well, alright, ALF,
you can speak to Jake.

13:42.122 --> 13:43.755
But remember, be tactful.

13:43.757 --> 13:46.457
Explain to him that we don't
wanna cause him any problems.

13:46.459 --> 13:49.661
We just want that brooch back.

13:49.663 --> 13:51.229
Don't worry.

13:51.231 --> 13:54.032
I know just how to handle this.

13:54.034 --> 13:56.901
Where do we keep the hot light
and the bull horn?

13:58.104 --> 14:01.306
[instrumental music]

14:04.744 --> 14:07.312
[footsteps approaching]

14:07.314 --> 14:09.414
Uh, Brian said
you wanted to talk to me?

14:09.416 --> 14:12.050
Oh, yeah, I did. I do.

14:12.052 --> 14:14.719
I did and I do. Both.

14:16.456 --> 14:18.489
So talk.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.193
You start.

14:22.195 --> 14:24.596
I don't have anything
to talk about.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.665
Nothing you wanna say to me?

14:27.667 --> 14:30.735
No, you're the one who wanted
to talk to me, remember?

14:30.737 --> 14:33.304
Ah, yes, yes.

14:35.642 --> 14:38.142
[sighs]

14:38.144 --> 14:40.578
- Well?
- Well..

14:40.580 --> 14:43.314
What I have to talk about
is difficult.

14:43.316 --> 14:48.219
I don't know how to broach
the subject.

14:49.956 --> 14:51.489
You can trust me.

14:51.491 --> 14:54.859
I know.
And I appreciate that, Jake.

14:54.861 --> 14:59.264
I'm glad you could steal
some time to talk with me.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.900
My pleasure.

15:01.902 --> 15:04.035
I mean, I don't wanna rob you

15:04.037 --> 15:06.871
of any time with your mother.

15:06.873 --> 15:08.706
What are you trying to say, ALF?

15:08.708 --> 15:10.008
Nothing.

15:10.010 --> 15:12.277
If I had something to say
about your mother

15:12.279 --> 15:13.912
I'd say it.

15:15.482 --> 15:17.215
What about my mother?

15:17.217 --> 15:19.317
Well, she seems very nice.

15:19.319 --> 15:20.919
I mean, we haven't met
or anything

15:20.921 --> 15:24.722
but she certainly doesn't look
like a thief.

15:24.724 --> 15:26.925
She's not a thief.

15:26.927 --> 15:30.695
Okay, she's a sleepwalker
who's into accessories.

15:31.598 --> 15:34.732
She's neither of those either.

15:34.734 --> 15:39.804
Well, I saw her take a brooch
from Kate's jewelry box.

15:41.141 --> 15:44.575
[sighs]
I was afraid of that.

15:44.577 --> 15:47.478
So you do know something
about this.

15:48.114 --> 15:49.514
Yeah.

15:50.750 --> 15:55.119
[chuckles]
See, my mom's a kleptomaniac.

15:55.121 --> 15:56.721
Uh-huh?

15:58.625 --> 16:00.591
A what?

16:00.593 --> 16:04.329
She doesn't mean to take things
that don't belong to her.

16:04.331 --> 16:07.765
The doctor says
she just can't help herself.

16:07.767 --> 16:10.868
I think the problem is
she<i> does</i> help herself.

16:12.439 --> 16:15.473
It-it's a sickness
of the mind, kinda.

16:15.475 --> 16:19.344
I thought she was coming out
here to tell me she was better.

16:19.346 --> 16:21.612
Well, it's a small brooch.

16:21.614 --> 16:24.382
Maybe she's trying to cut down.

16:24.384 --> 16:27.452
Look, I'll get it back,
don't worry.

16:27.454 --> 16:30.521
What are you gonna say to her?

16:30.523 --> 16:32.957
I don't know, I-I-I guess
I'll wait till she's asleep

16:32.959 --> 16:35.526
and lift it off her.

16:35.528 --> 16:38.229
Who are you people, the Capones?

16:38.231 --> 16:40.465
You've gotta talk to her
about this.

16:40.467 --> 16:41.966
It won't do any good, besides

16:41.968 --> 16:44.302
she's going back to New York
tomorrow.

16:44.304 --> 16:46.871
Oh, good,
she'll take Manhattan, the Bronx

16:46.873 --> 16:49.173
and Staten Island, too.

16:49.175 --> 16:53.244
Look, ALF, I've had this fight
with my mother a million times.

16:53.246 --> 16:56.014
[scoffs]
I give up on her.

16:56.016 --> 16:58.983
Well, how could you give up
on your own mother?

16:58.985 --> 17:02.687
I mean, it's not like
she's the Cubs.

17:02.689 --> 17:05.857
Look, I said I'd get
your stupid pin, didn't I?

17:05.859 --> 17:07.525
Now why don't you just
leave me alone?

17:11.331 --> 17:13.598
Well, if you're gonna be
that way about it

17:13.600 --> 17:15.867
I suggest you leave.

17:17.871 --> 17:20.872
[instrumental music]

17:25.311 --> 17:26.878
[knocking on door]

17:26.880 --> 17:29.247
- Uh, hi, mom.
- Hi, honey.

17:29.249 --> 17:30.648
Come on in.

17:33.219 --> 17:36.020
- Uh, nice suitcase.
- Thanks.

17:37.457 --> 17:40.124
- Those aren't your initials.
- I won it.

17:42.762 --> 17:44.762
You know, um

17:44.764 --> 17:47.265
there's something
I'd like to talk to you about.

17:47.267 --> 17:50.501
Hm, me, too.
But, uh, you go first.

17:51.471 --> 17:53.337
Well, since school's

17:53.339 --> 17:55.673
almost out for the summer anyway

17:55.675 --> 17:59.143
I thought you'd might wanna
come home with me now.

17:59.145 --> 18:02.346
Oh, I thought maybe
you wanted to talk about dinner

18:02.348 --> 18:04.449
at the Tanners last night.

18:05.618 --> 18:09.554
What do you mean?
I had a very nice time.

18:09.556 --> 18:11.823
About what happened there.

18:13.059 --> 18:14.358
We ate roast chicken.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.194
After that.

18:16.196 --> 18:18.696
- We had coffee.
- Before that.

18:18.698 --> 18:21.132
Look, as much as I'm enjoying
this trip down memory lane

18:21.134 --> 18:23.701
would you like to tell me
what you're getting at?

18:23.703 --> 18:26.370
Look, I know you took a pin

18:26.372 --> 18:29.173
out of Mrs. Tanner's jewelry box
last night.

18:29.175 --> 18:30.775
That's impossible!

18:30.777 --> 18:32.243
Impossible
you could have taken it

18:32.245 --> 18:34.112
or impossible
I could know about it?

18:34.114 --> 18:37.148
I didn't. And even if I did,
everybody was at dinner.

18:37.150 --> 18:39.984
- Nobody could have possibly--
- Nothing's changed, has it, ma?

18:39.986 --> 18:42.153
Yeah, something's changed,
you got a mouth.

18:42.155 --> 18:45.656
[scoffs]
How could you? How could you
steal from the Tanners?

18:45.658 --> 18:47.391
They're my friends, ma.

18:47.393 --> 18:49.393
I was gonna give it back.

18:49.395 --> 18:51.395
Actually, it's pretty tacky.

18:51.397 --> 18:54.665
[scoffs]
I-I can't believe you!

18:54.667 --> 18:56.434
You come out here
hopin' I'll go back with you

18:56.436 --> 18:59.604
and then you pull somethin'
like this!

18:59.606 --> 19:03.207
Honey, you know
I never planned to do this.

19:05.345 --> 19:07.011
It just happens.

19:16.489 --> 19:19.757
The problem is
that it's still happenin'.

19:19.759 --> 19:22.193
[scoffs]
Are-are you seein' your shrink?

19:25.098 --> 19:26.364
[sighs]
I give up.

19:26.366 --> 19:27.431
If you won't help yourself

19:27.433 --> 19:29.200
there's nothin' I can do.

19:29.202 --> 19:31.636
Yes, there is.

19:31.638 --> 19:33.437
You could come home with me.

19:33.439 --> 19:35.439
We made a deal, remember?

19:35.441 --> 19:37.241
I would come home
when you were better.

19:37.243 --> 19:39.644
I am better.

19:39.646 --> 19:41.913
Well, I'm-I'm almost better.

19:41.915 --> 19:45.716
A-and it would be a lot easier
if you were there with me.

19:45.718 --> 19:49.921
We tried that before.
I'm not what you need right now.

19:49.923 --> 19:52.657
- Jake, you--
- I want things to work out!

19:52.659 --> 19:55.193
But you have to want it, too.

19:55.195 --> 19:56.928
I do.

19:56.930 --> 20:00.097
Then how about goin' next door
and givin' this pin back

20:00.099 --> 20:01.766
to Mrs. Tanner?

20:02.435 --> 20:03.901
I can't.

20:06.406 --> 20:10.074
I'm-I'm-I'm sorry, Jake.
I'd like to.

20:11.544 --> 20:12.977
I just..

20:14.514 --> 20:16.280
I just can't.

20:18.818 --> 20:20.184
Not yet.

20:28.528 --> 20:30.428
Yo, Jake.

20:30.430 --> 20:33.097
ALF, how long
have you been out there?

20:33.099 --> 20:35.166
Long enough.

20:35.168 --> 20:38.636
But for what it's worth,
I think you did the right thing.

20:38.638 --> 20:42.073
Yeah. So how come
I feel so crummy?

20:42.075 --> 20:45.176
You ate Kate's cooking
last night, remember?

20:46.946 --> 20:50.548
Anyway, I'm glad you're not
going back to New York.

20:50.550 --> 20:53.384
I, uh, kinda wish I was.

20:53.386 --> 20:57.788
Well, that was really nice
what you said to your mom.

20:57.790 --> 20:59.290
You know,
there's nothing like the love

20:59.292 --> 21:01.826
between a mother and child.

21:01.828 --> 21:05.029
Except, maybe the love
between two florists.

21:06.766 --> 21:09.367
Give this back to Mrs. Tanner,
would you?

21:09.369 --> 21:13.137
And, uh, tell her
I'm, we're sorry.

21:14.607 --> 21:17.174
So what happens
to your mother now?

21:17.176 --> 21:20.511
I guess she'll go back
to her doctor.

21:20.513 --> 21:22.213
Well, I hope he's an eye doctor.

21:22.215 --> 21:26.150
This is the ugliest pin
I've ever seen!

21:26.152 --> 21:30.154
Looks like a blood clot.
Ha. Blood clot!

21:30.156 --> 21:32.156
Ha. Oh, I kill me.

21:32.158 --> 21:34.825
[laughing]

[instrumental music]

21:38.498 --> 21:40.998
[instrumental music]

21:42.769 --> 21:44.001
I still don't get it.

21:44.003 --> 21:46.270
How come Jake's mother
takes stuff

21:46.272 --> 21:48.939
but she's not a crook?

21:48.941 --> 21:52.176
Well, Jake's mother suffers
from a psychological disorder

21:52.178 --> 21:55.079
that motivates her
to steal impulsively

21:55.081 --> 21:59.317
without being prompted
by any apparent need or desire.

22:00.553 --> 22:03.554
Thanks for clearing
that up, dad.

22:03.556 --> 22:05.256
How's Jake taking all of this?

22:05.258 --> 22:07.658
The poor boy's
been through an awful lot.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.093
Well, he's doing much better.

22:09.095 --> 22:12.096
His mom went back
to New York early this morning.

22:12.098 --> 22:14.799
Did they resolve anything
before she left?

22:14.801 --> 22:16.500
Only that he won't go back
to live with her

22:16.502 --> 22:17.868
until she gets help.

22:17.870 --> 22:19.570
Oh, that's too bad.

22:19.572 --> 22:23.207
Well, maybe that's exactly
the motivation that she needed.

22:23.209 --> 22:25.142
Maybe. Maybe not.

22:25.144 --> 22:28.079
She took Trevor's
coin collection with her.

22:33.219 --> 22:36.220
