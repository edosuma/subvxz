00:02.569 --> 00:05.170
- Ray, have you ever
even seen our budget?

00:05.172 --> 00:07.139
- There's an actual piece of
paper that says "budget" on it?

00:07.141 --> 00:10.109
- You have no idea
what I do here, do you?

00:10.111 --> 00:11.777
- Why do I need to know?

00:11.779 --> 00:14.079
- Okay, I'm going
to explain it to you.

00:14.081 --> 00:15.347
- Oh, don't. No.

00:15.349 --> 00:16.582
You're gonna kill the magic.

00:18.485 --> 00:22.254
- Okay, once every two weeks,
I go into the hamper,

00:22.256 --> 00:24.523
I find your pants,
and I dig out your paycheck.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.759
- You're welcome.

00:26.761 --> 00:28.794
- I deduct our fixed costs,
and I figure out

00:28.796 --> 00:31.096
How much we have
to service our debt.

00:31.098 --> 00:33.232
Now, whatever's left over
is our discretionary fund.

00:33.234 --> 00:34.733
And from that,
I put away as much as possible

00:34.735 --> 00:37.202
For the kids' college growth
and income plan.

00:37.204 --> 00:39.571
You understand?

00:39.573 --> 00:43.175
- You know, one of your eyes
is bigger than the other one.

00:43.177 --> 00:45.077
- You can't even listen to me.

00:45.079 --> 00:46.812
You can't even hear
about the budget?

00:46.814 --> 00:48.247
- You're making it
so complicated.

00:48.249 --> 00:49.782
- What do you mean
I'm making it complicated?

00:49.784 --> 00:51.817
- Yeah, you are. Why don't you
just pay the bills?

00:54.087 --> 00:56.588
I didn't mean what I said.

00:56.590 --> 00:57.588
I didn't mean that.
I meant--

00:57.590 --> 01:01.326
What I meant was, it seems like
it should be easier--for you.

01:01.328 --> 01:03.395
- It's going to be a lot easier.

01:03.397 --> 01:04.596
- Okay. I'm sorry.

01:04.598 --> 01:05.731
- No, no, no. You're right.

01:05.733 --> 01:07.399
I'm making it
way too complicated.

01:07.401 --> 01:11.703
Just pay the bills.

01:11.705 --> 01:13.272
- All right,
I guess I'll have to show you

01:13.274 --> 01:14.573
How easy it can be, then.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.447
You saw daddy talking.
You couldn't stop me?

01:27.821 --> 01:29.088
- Health department.

01:29.090 --> 01:31.523
- That ain't funny, raymond.

01:31.525 --> 01:33.158
- Hey, couple of slices?
- Hey. Yeah.

01:33.160 --> 01:34.560
Hi, how are ya?

01:34.562 --> 01:36.261
Nothing.

01:36.263 --> 01:38.163
- Hey, ray-gele.
- Hey, andy.

01:38.165 --> 01:39.798
Thanks for coming, man.
- No problem.

01:39.800 --> 01:43.469
I was in the mood
for a little botulism.

01:43.471 --> 01:45.304
- Do me a favor, huh?
I've been paying the bills

01:45.306 --> 01:46.839
For the last couple of weeks.

01:46.841 --> 01:48.440
I got this
from the electric company.

01:48.442 --> 01:51.276
Take a look at that.

01:51.278 --> 01:52.611
- They're turning off
your service.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.179
- Yeah. Why?
I don't get it.

01:54.181 --> 01:55.747
I mean, I paid all this stuff
six weeks ago.

01:55.749 --> 01:57.182
- Can I ask you something?

01:57.184 --> 01:58.617
Why are you
handling the checkbook?

01:58.619 --> 02:00.619
Did debra leave you?

02:00.621 --> 02:03.222
- Debra, she's made such a big
deal about paying the bills.

02:03.224 --> 02:04.222
I'm just trying to show her

02:04.224 --> 02:05.591
That it doesn't have
to be that complicated.

02:05.593 --> 02:09.128
- Well, no electricity
is less complicated.

02:09.130 --> 02:10.696
You're like the amish now.

02:10.698 --> 02:12.531
- Fine. Come on.
You're good with numbers.

02:12.533 --> 02:14.600
Here. Take a look at this stuff.

02:14.602 --> 02:15.600
I paid all these bills.

02:15.602 --> 02:19.138
There's no reason they should be
sending me mean letters.

02:19.140 --> 02:21.473
- Well, here's a reason.
Your check bounced.

02:21.475 --> 02:22.608
- What?

02:22.610 --> 02:27.179
- Wow!
You bounced many checks here!

02:27.181 --> 02:28.580
You bounced 14 checks,

02:28.582 --> 02:30.549
And you were charged
$300 in penalties.

02:30.551 --> 02:33.152
Excellent work!

02:33.154 --> 02:36.255
- What do you mean?
I sent these checks myself.

02:36.257 --> 02:37.756
- Checks that didn't clear, ray.

02:37.758 --> 02:41.293
You might as well have sent
little pieces of toilet paper.

02:41.295 --> 02:42.895
- I make more
than enough money.

02:42.897 --> 02:45.330
- Well, mazel tov to you.

02:47.300 --> 02:49.768
You're $3,000 overdrawn here.

02:49.770 --> 02:51.537
You didn't even
open up your bank statement!

02:51.539 --> 02:54.373
- I trusted the bank.

02:54.375 --> 02:55.807
- You didn't reconcile
your checkbook!

02:55.809 --> 02:57.242
- Huh?

02:57.244 --> 02:59.178
- You have to keep track, ray!

02:59.180 --> 03:01.280
Give me this.

03:01.282 --> 03:02.714
What did you do here?

03:02.716 --> 03:05.350
Why'd you pay so much
on your visa card?

03:05.352 --> 03:07.452
- Because I'm not
going to pay interest charges.

03:07.454 --> 03:09.821
You pay in full,
no interest charges.

03:09.823 --> 03:11.190
- That is smart.

03:11.192 --> 03:13.659
No money left, either.

03:13.661 --> 03:15.460
Look at this,
debra had everything in order.

03:15.462 --> 03:17.796
- Yeah, yeah.
Debra, debra, debra.

03:17.798 --> 03:20.432
All right,
I'm sick of this money stuff.

03:20.434 --> 03:21.733
Just tell me what I have to do.

03:21.735 --> 03:22.733
- All right, first,

03:22.735 --> 03:25.204
You got to take
last month's ending balance.

03:25.206 --> 03:28.574
Then you add the interest
accrued on the account.

03:28.576 --> 03:31.543
Then you add all the checks
that we know have cleared,

03:31.545 --> 03:35.514
And then you subtract
that number from...

03:35.516 --> 03:37.316
Ray, what did
I just say to you?

03:39.886 --> 03:42.354
- "accrued."

03:42.356 --> 03:43.589
- All right, ray,

03:43.591 --> 03:44.823
You had your little fun
with mommy's checkbook.

03:44.825 --> 03:46.491
Now it's time
to give it back to her.

03:46.493 --> 03:48.393
- No, no, all right,
I'm not giving it back to her,

03:48.395 --> 03:49.995
'cause then she's gonna know
that I couldn't do this.

03:49.997 --> 03:50.995
- Well, she may get an inkling

03:50.997 --> 03:54.466
When they cut off your power
and tow away your house.

03:54.468 --> 03:56.301
- I don't get it!
Look, how can it be this bad?

03:56.303 --> 03:57.736
It's only been six weeks.

03:57.738 --> 04:00.005
- That's what's so shocking.

04:02.475 --> 04:05.377
You need to put $3,000
in the bank,

04:05.379 --> 04:06.745
And you're going to have
to tell debra about this.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.814
- No. No, I can't.

04:08.816 --> 04:11.016
- Ray, eventually she's
going to see that checkbook.

04:12.819 --> 04:15.020
- You're right.

04:15.022 --> 04:16.588
You're right.
I got to do the smart thing.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.724
- Good.

04:18.726 --> 04:20.359
- I'll make a fake checkbook.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.332
- Like that shade?
- Very nice.

04:27.334 --> 04:28.533
- Look at this. Look at this.

04:28.535 --> 04:30.569
Toes.

04:30.571 --> 04:31.970
Just a little bit darker
than the nails.

04:31.972 --> 04:34.840
That's what the woman
said was "in" now.

04:34.842 --> 04:36.708
- What, did you go
to the beauty parlor?

04:36.710 --> 04:40.279
- Salon, grandpa.

04:40.281 --> 04:42.547
Yes. And it was great.

04:42.549 --> 04:43.882
- What do they charge
for that?

04:43.884 --> 04:44.883
- $20.

04:44.885 --> 04:49.354
- $20? That's like...

04:49.356 --> 04:51.857
A buck a nail!

04:51.859 --> 04:54.593
- What is the big deal?
I never do this.

04:54.595 --> 04:55.961
- I don't think this is the time

04:55.963 --> 04:58.597
To start doing things
we never do.

04:58.599 --> 05:00.499
You know,
I mean we should barely

05:00.501 --> 05:02.434
Be doing the things we've done.

05:02.436 --> 05:04.503
And maybe cut back
a little on those.

05:04.505 --> 05:06.305
- Oh, oh, I get it.

05:06.307 --> 05:07.572
Now that
you're doing the checkbook,

05:07.574 --> 05:09.074
You're mr. Responsible.

05:09.076 --> 05:10.509
You know,
to tell you the truth,

05:10.511 --> 05:12.010
I'm surprised
you could stay on top of that.

05:12.012 --> 05:13.912
- I'm on top of it.

05:13.914 --> 05:18.016
I'm fully reconciled...
And accruing.

05:20.586 --> 05:21.953
- Great.

05:21.955 --> 05:24.423
To tell you the truth,
I was a little afraid to ask.

05:24.425 --> 05:27.626
- You don't got to be afraid.
You want to see the...

05:27.628 --> 05:30.362
Checkbook?

05:30.364 --> 05:31.830
- Yeah. Okay.

05:32.832 --> 05:35.934
- I got no problem with that.

05:37.804 --> 05:38.970
Here, take a look.

05:41.507 --> 05:43.542
Everything balanced.

05:43.544 --> 05:49.715
Paid in full, except the visa.
You don't pay that in full.

05:49.717 --> 05:54.052
There you go.
Car, mortgage, electric bill.

05:54.054 --> 05:55.721
All paid up.

05:55.723 --> 05:57.723
Huh?

05:57.725 --> 05:59.458
- [gasps]
- what?

05:59.460 --> 06:01.460
- I don't believe this.

06:01.462 --> 06:03.862
- You don't?

06:03.864 --> 06:05.797
- This is amazing.

06:05.799 --> 06:07.466
This is...

06:07.468 --> 06:09.067
Beautiful.

06:09.069 --> 06:10.936
- Yeah?

06:10.938 --> 06:12.070
- You did this?

06:12.072 --> 06:13.605
- Yeah.

06:13.607 --> 06:15.407
I said I would, right?

06:15.409 --> 06:16.875
- [sighs]

06:16.877 --> 06:19.644
- What? What's the matter?

06:19.646 --> 06:22.581
- I don't know.
You just--I mean...

06:22.583 --> 06:24.783
You've been just doing it.

06:24.785 --> 06:25.917
You didn't complain once.

06:25.919 --> 06:27.919
I was always--
I don't know.

06:27.921 --> 06:31.089
It was such
a huge pressure for me.

06:31.091 --> 06:32.891
- There's some pressure
for me.

06:37.096 --> 06:38.797
- You'd never know it.

06:42.168 --> 06:43.402
Thanks, honey.

06:43.404 --> 06:44.469
- You're welcome.

06:48.107 --> 06:49.508
Good night.

07:13.499 --> 07:15.600
- Hey, ray.
How's it going?

07:15.602 --> 07:16.600
What's so important?

07:16.602 --> 07:19.037
- Nothing. Nothing.
Keep your voice down.

07:19.039 --> 07:20.037
- Well, something's up.

07:20.039 --> 07:22.908
Saw you sneaking out of your
house at 5:00 in the a.M.

07:24.811 --> 07:26.878
- Stop watching my house.

07:28.781 --> 07:30.682
And I wasn't sneaking out.

07:30.684 --> 07:34.152
I had to get over to the
electric company payment center.

07:34.154 --> 07:35.854
- Why?

07:35.856 --> 07:37.155
- 'cause those idiots,

07:37.157 --> 07:38.857
They shut off
my power last night,

07:38.859 --> 07:40.192
And I didn't want debra
to wake up without power.

07:43.596 --> 07:44.996
She likes toast.

07:46.666 --> 07:48.033
- What's going on, raymond?

07:48.035 --> 07:49.167
- Nothing.

07:49.169 --> 07:50.535
- You got fired?

07:50.537 --> 07:52.971
- No, no.

07:52.973 --> 07:55.507
- How you doin'?

07:55.509 --> 07:58.009
Nothing.

07:58.011 --> 07:59.878
- Let me ask you something.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.681
Remember when you told me
that moving in with mom and dad

08:02.683 --> 08:04.850
Was going to help you
put money away?

08:04.852 --> 08:06.151
How's that going for you?

08:06.153 --> 08:07.919
- You're not moving in
with us, raymond.

08:07.921 --> 08:09.221
- What? I--

08:09.223 --> 08:11.857
- We have a very delicate
ecosystem over there.

08:11.859 --> 08:14.192
- I'm not asking
to move in, all right?

08:14.194 --> 08:15.827
I'm asking about
the money part.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.596
How's that going?

08:17.598 --> 08:19.731
- Good. I'm saving a little.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.566
- Yeah. Good. Good.

08:21.568 --> 08:23.602
Good, I mean,
you know, it's smart.

08:23.604 --> 08:24.602
A lot of people,

08:24.604 --> 08:26.605
They make fun of a man
who lives with his parents,

08:26.607 --> 08:29.040
But they don't
see the upside to that.

08:29.042 --> 08:31.042
I mean,
it's the financial security.

08:31.044 --> 08:33.979
- That's exactly right.
Thank you.

08:33.981 --> 08:38.683
- I envy you, you know?
'cause you're kind of set.

08:38.685 --> 08:40.252
You are.
Matter of fact,

08:40.254 --> 08:43.788
I was going to ask if I could
borrow a little money.

08:43.790 --> 08:46.658
- Oh?

08:46.660 --> 08:49.694
- Yeah, just--
just a quick loan.

08:49.696 --> 08:53.665
- Well, well, wait, wait.
Let's not go too quick here.

08:53.667 --> 08:57.035
So...You need my help.

08:59.272 --> 09:00.271
- You know what? Forget it.
I shouldn't--I shouldn't--

09:00.273 --> 09:04.576
- No, no. Look, hey, we all
stumble. How much you need?

09:04.578 --> 09:06.678
- Oh, no.
It's just--it's too much.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.280
- How much?

09:08.282 --> 09:10.015
- $3,000.

09:11.918 --> 09:14.319
- $3,000?

09:14.321 --> 09:16.288
Gambling?

09:16.290 --> 09:17.956
- No.

09:17.958 --> 09:20.225
- Raymond, you're not...

09:20.227 --> 09:23.094
- I'm not doing cocaine,
robert.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.930
- I'm going to give you
a phone number.

09:24.932 --> 09:27.299
- Robert, it's not--
will you stop it?

09:27.301 --> 09:30.569
I'm having a little trouble

09:30.571 --> 09:31.803
Paying this month's bills,
that's all.

09:31.805 --> 09:34.906
- Mm-hmm. Debra know?

09:34.908 --> 09:37.075
- I want to keep debra
out of this.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.075
- Uh-huh.

09:38.077 --> 09:41.046
You get a lady in trouble,
raymond?

09:41.048 --> 09:42.046
- No!

09:42.048 --> 09:44.215
- Listen, you can level with me.
I'm your brother.

09:44.217 --> 09:45.650
Okay, you screwed up.
- I didn't screw up.

09:45.652 --> 09:46.650
- What did you do?

09:46.652 --> 09:48.320
- Why are you assuming
I screwed up for?

09:48.322 --> 09:50.021
- Then why can't
debra find out?

09:50.023 --> 09:52.190
- Because...

09:52.192 --> 09:54.759
- She's the one
with the problem?

09:59.265 --> 10:00.932
- Yep.

10:03.703 --> 10:06.871
- Oh, she's not going nuts
with the credit cards, is she?

10:08.174 --> 10:09.374
- Well...

10:09.376 --> 10:11.343
- Yeah, well, yeah.
I've seen it before.

10:11.345 --> 10:13.278
Compulsive shopping.
Rip a family apart.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.680
- Yeah, I know. I know.
She feels bad, you know,

10:15.682 --> 10:16.748
About it already,
so let's just--

10:16.750 --> 10:18.149
- Wow!
- Yeah.

10:18.151 --> 10:20.885
- I had no idea
she was like that.

10:20.887 --> 10:24.289
- It was a surprise to me.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.358
- You know what she needs?

10:26.360 --> 10:28.193
She needs to get
her self-worth back.

10:28.195 --> 10:29.361
She should get a job

10:29.363 --> 10:31.396
And earn back
part of that money, huh?

10:31.398 --> 10:34.099
- I thought of that,
and then I started thinking,

10:34.101 --> 10:35.800
You know, hey,
what about the kids?

10:35.802 --> 10:38.103
I mean, they need their mother.

10:38.105 --> 10:40.171
- Of course. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

10:40.173 --> 10:41.740
- That's all right.
- Stupid.

10:41.742 --> 10:43.174
- It's okay. It's okay.

10:43.176 --> 10:46.845
So, you know, what do you think?
Can you help us?

10:46.847 --> 10:48.013
- Well, sure, of course.

10:48.015 --> 10:49.681
$3,000 enough?

10:49.683 --> 10:52.283
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
it's good.

10:52.285 --> 10:54.319
- What about you, ray?

10:54.321 --> 10:57.022
How you doing?

10:57.024 --> 10:59.658
Do you need anything?

10:59.660 --> 11:01.292
- No, no, no, I'm fine.

11:01.294 --> 11:04.129
You know,
this isn't about me.

11:12.905 --> 11:14.973
- Hello, raymond.

11:14.975 --> 11:16.041
- Where's robert?

11:16.043 --> 11:17.208
- Oh, he was late for work,

11:17.210 --> 11:19.277
But he asked me
to give this to you.

11:19.279 --> 11:20.445
- Oh, good.

11:20.447 --> 11:23.281
- Is there anything
you want to tell us?

11:23.283 --> 11:24.281
- No, like what?

11:24.283 --> 11:28.219
- Like how come there's
a $3,000 check in there?

11:28.221 --> 11:30.121
- Robert.

11:30.123 --> 11:31.990
- Why are you taking money
from your brother?

11:31.992 --> 11:34.092
- Keep it down.

11:34.094 --> 11:35.393
- Why didn't you
just come to us?

11:35.395 --> 11:39.030
I would love to help debra
with her problem.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.432
- He told you about that?

11:40.434 --> 11:42.400
- At least he talks
to his mother.

11:42.402 --> 11:44.903
- How come robert's got
3,000 bucks to throw around?

11:44.905 --> 11:46.204
He should be giving us
rent money.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.106
- He's our son, frank.

11:48.108 --> 11:49.974
You don't charge your son.

11:49.976 --> 11:52.744
- He's a giant, marie.

11:52.746 --> 11:55.213
You know what it costs
just to heat him?

11:55.215 --> 11:56.347
- All right, okay,
thanks for coming.

11:56.349 --> 11:57.347
- Food too!

11:57.349 --> 12:00.418
He's got 3 grand, and I'm paying
for the pudding pops!

12:00.420 --> 12:02.153
- Well, you eat them too, frank.

12:02.155 --> 12:04.322
- No more pudding pops!

12:04.324 --> 12:06.491
And no solid white tuna, either.

12:06.493 --> 12:07.992
Chunk light is perfectly fine.

12:07.994 --> 12:11.162
I'm not running
a country club anymore!

12:11.164 --> 12:13.364
- I like the solid white.

12:13.366 --> 12:15.200
- Too bad!

12:15.202 --> 12:17.001
- It's my one luxury.

12:17.003 --> 12:18.903
- All right, already.

12:18.905 --> 12:20.505
Come on, I'll give you
a tuna boat, all right,

12:20.507 --> 12:22.340
If you just give me the check
and get out of here.

12:22.342 --> 12:23.775
All right,
I don't want debra to hear this.

12:23.777 --> 12:25.877
- Well, maybe debra should hear.

12:25.879 --> 12:28.146
I mean, I see the way
she dresses

12:28.148 --> 12:30.215
And takes these
little trips to the mall

12:30.217 --> 12:32.751
So that
"the kids can get out."

12:32.753 --> 12:35.954
How long has she
been out of control?

12:35.956 --> 12:39.023
- Not that long.

12:39.025 --> 12:40.425
- Doesn't she handle
your checkbook?

12:40.427 --> 12:42.026
- No. Not anymore.

12:42.028 --> 12:44.462
- That's good.
Cut her off cold turkey.

12:44.464 --> 12:48.133
You don't give a boozer
the key to the liquor cabinet.

12:48.135 --> 12:50.468
- Okay, boys, come on.
We got to get going.

12:50.470 --> 12:51.836
Hey, marie. Hey, frank.

12:51.838 --> 12:53.938
- Hi, debra.

12:53.940 --> 12:56.875
What a very nice outfit.
- Oh, thank you.

12:56.877 --> 12:58.777
Look, my nails match.
I had them done.

12:58.779 --> 13:00.979
- I noticed.
- Oh, yes. See, ray?

13:00.981 --> 13:02.247
It was worth the money.

13:02.249 --> 13:04.282
Oh, listen,
can you give me some cash

13:04.284 --> 13:05.550
'cause I can't find
my atm card?

13:05.552 --> 13:07.886
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

13:07.888 --> 13:09.354
I have to pick up ally
at ballet class.

13:09.356 --> 13:12.924
- You know, I don't even
think I have cash on me.

13:12.926 --> 13:14.325
- Okay.
- Dad, you wouldn't, uh...

13:14.327 --> 13:15.960
- No.

13:16.962 --> 13:18.196
No!

13:21.100 --> 13:22.867
- Okay,
so just give me a check.

13:22.869 --> 13:23.867
- Check?

13:23.869 --> 13:26.538
- Yeah, I'll just stop at the
bank and cash it on the way.

13:26.540 --> 13:28.306
- All righty.

13:29.341 --> 13:31.342
- A blank check?

13:31.344 --> 13:33.845
- Mm, maybe I'll
swing by tiffany's.

13:33.847 --> 13:35.013
See ya later.

13:37.149 --> 13:39.450
- My god!

13:39.452 --> 13:41.019
- A blank check.

13:41.021 --> 13:42.453
You're dumber
than I tell people.

13:44.523 --> 13:46.324
- Give me that.
- Where are you going?

13:46.326 --> 13:48.359
- I got to put this in the bank
before she gets there.

13:55.367 --> 13:59.103
- I told him
she was too pretty for him.

13:59.105 --> 14:01.172
- Thank god
I didn't make that mistake.

16:42.267 --> 16:43.701
- Are you coming to bed?

16:43.703 --> 16:44.769
- Can't.

16:46.271 --> 16:47.605
- How long
are you going to be?

16:47.607 --> 16:49.640
- Depends.

16:49.642 --> 16:52.210
- On what?

16:52.212 --> 16:55.313
- How long it takes to fix
what you've done here.

16:57.449 --> 16:59.050
- All right,
so like a few minutes, right?

17:05.557 --> 17:07.525
Listen.

17:07.527 --> 17:08.793
I'm really sorry.

17:08.795 --> 17:12.163
- Yeah, I know you are.

17:12.165 --> 17:14.265
- Can I get anything?
Do you need any help?

17:14.267 --> 17:15.533
Anything I can do at all?

17:19.238 --> 17:23.041
Look, shouldn't you just
yell at me here or something?

17:23.043 --> 17:25.710
- Ray, when you're on the
titanic, you load the lifeboats.

17:25.712 --> 17:28.246
You don't stop
to yell at the iceberg.

17:33.719 --> 17:35.253
- Hmm.

17:39.458 --> 17:41.225
Hey, who wants oatmeal?

17:41.227 --> 17:42.527
- I will say this, ray.

17:42.529 --> 17:44.729
- Okay. Good. Good. Go.

17:44.731 --> 17:47.532
- You put so much effort
into a fake checkbook.

17:47.534 --> 17:49.367
Why didn't you just take
a little of that effort

17:49.369 --> 17:51.335
In doing it right
in the first place?

17:53.172 --> 17:56.374
- I don't have to
sit here and take this.

17:59.778 --> 18:02.447
- No, really!
Come on, I want to know.

18:02.449 --> 18:04.782
- It's the numbers.
I stink at numbers.

18:04.784 --> 18:07.852
- You wouldn't
if they were golf scores.

18:10.355 --> 18:12.590
And that's what
bothers me the most.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.392
I mean, it's not
that you can't do it.

18:14.394 --> 18:16.094
It's that you won't do it.

18:16.096 --> 18:18.262
You're like the kids.
They only want to do what's fun.

18:18.264 --> 18:21.466
- And yet,
you still love them.

18:25.404 --> 18:27.305
- You know, I hate doing
the checkbook,

18:27.307 --> 18:28.706
But I do it anyway.

18:28.708 --> 18:31.609
And do you know why I do it
even though I hate it?

18:33.712 --> 18:37.415
- 'cause deep down,
you really like it.

18:38.617 --> 18:40.718
- No, ray.

18:40.720 --> 18:44.455
- I know, I know, I know,
'cause you're an adult.

18:44.457 --> 18:45.857
And if it wasn't for you,

18:45.859 --> 18:48.793
All this would be
a big smoking crater.

18:52.397 --> 18:55.299
And I...I...

18:55.301 --> 18:56.567
- What?

18:58.403 --> 19:01.539
- I appreciate
what you do here.

19:03.609 --> 19:06.511
- You know,
you've never said that before.

19:06.513 --> 19:09.380
- Sure, I have.
Remember our wedding night?

19:12.451 --> 19:17.622
- Well, it was very nice
both times that you said it.

19:17.624 --> 19:19.590
Maybe you could say it
a little more often.

19:21.393 --> 19:23.861
- Okay. I will. I will.

19:23.863 --> 19:25.229
I appreciate you.

19:27.299 --> 19:28.366
I appreciate you.

19:28.368 --> 19:29.600
- Whoa, wait a minute.

19:29.602 --> 19:32.403
That's not
a "get out of jail free" card.

19:32.405 --> 19:33.604
We're not done here.
Get back here.

19:33.606 --> 19:36.340
Now, look, I've gone through
your checkbook,

19:36.342 --> 19:39.443
And I've gone through
your fake checkbook.

19:39.445 --> 19:41.746
And it's just not adding up.

19:41.748 --> 19:44.582
- Yeah, you know what
that might be?

19:46.818 --> 19:50.354
- A third checkbook?

19:50.356 --> 19:55.693
- I, uh, I accidentally bounced
a check in the fake one.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.628
- What check did you bounce?

19:57.630 --> 19:59.397
- I don't know which one.
It might've been--

19:59.399 --> 20:00.831
Yeah. That was it.
Yeah.

20:06.838 --> 20:08.339
- Hi, debra.

20:08.341 --> 20:09.874
- Hi, marie.
Hi, frank.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.909
- You know what happened
to me today?

20:11.911 --> 20:14.245
I got a new credit card
in the mail.

20:14.247 --> 20:15.913
But I think
it may be counterfeit.

20:15.915 --> 20:17.782
- Really?
- Yes.

20:17.784 --> 20:20.551
Would you mind if I compared
yours against mine?

20:20.553 --> 20:21.919
- Sure. No problem.

20:24.389 --> 20:25.489
Here. This one?

20:25.491 --> 20:26.591
- Yes.

20:29.528 --> 20:31.862
- What the hell
are you doing?

20:31.864 --> 20:33.998
- You'll thank us later, dear.

20:50.682 --> 20:51.949
- I appreciate you.
