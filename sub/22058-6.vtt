WEBVTT

00:03.754 --> 00:04.796
Are you OK?

00:07.132 --> 00:08.842
[man] <i>Previously on </i>Z Nation...

00:10.969 --> 00:12.512
I think I'll call her Lucy.

00:12.638 --> 00:13.722
Lucy?

00:13.805 --> 00:15.557
Lucy? Lucy?

00:15.724 --> 00:16.642
Lucy?

00:17.309 --> 00:18.894
-You've grown.
-Yeah, that happens,

00:18.977 --> 00:21.021
regardless of whether
you're there for it or not.

00:21.271 --> 00:22.439
He's bit.

00:22.773 --> 00:23.815
[muffled] Warren.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.402
-How's he doing?
-Not so good.

00:37.496 --> 00:38.747
[car engine roaring]

00:41.416 --> 00:42.960
-[thump]
-[moans]

00:43.043 --> 00:44.253
Hey, can we slow it down a little?

00:45.462 --> 00:46.755
-[moaning continues]
-He's still with us.

00:48.507 --> 00:49.716
[moaning] Where are we anyway?

00:51.927 --> 00:54.930
Looks like we just blew through
what's left of Eerie, Indiana.

00:55.138 --> 00:58.141
I spent some time there
pre-Apocalypse. Good people.

00:59.101 --> 01:01.311
Kinda weird, but man they like to party.

01:13.657 --> 01:14.658
Lieutenant Warren?

01:19.121 --> 01:20.038
Watch out for that...

01:20.122 --> 01:21.081
-[growling]
-[thump]

01:24.001 --> 01:25.085
zombie.

01:44.187 --> 01:46.189
Warren, I know it's
the Apocalypse and all,

01:46.356 --> 01:47.941
but could you maybe slow it down a little?

01:59.828 --> 02:00.704
[tires screech]

02:06.793 --> 02:08.211
What the hell, Warren?

02:08.295 --> 02:09.796
Where are we going?

02:11.757 --> 02:13.634
[moans, gasps]

02:15.969 --> 02:18.180
He's going into cardiac arrest!

02:26.647 --> 02:27.773
He don't look so good.

02:27.856 --> 02:30.484
-Thanks for the diagnosis.
-Stop the car!

02:33.528 --> 02:36.573
Warren! For the love of Pete and Pete,
pull over!

02:36.657 --> 02:38.492
Dad!

02:38.617 --> 02:40.327
It's OK. It's OK.

02:43.789 --> 02:45.082
Lieutenant Warren?

02:48.919 --> 02:50.420
Lieutenant Warren?

02:57.427 --> 02:58.970
Warren, stop! Warren!

02:59.054 --> 03:00.555
[brakes screech]

03:06.937 --> 03:08.271
[panting]

03:27.332 --> 03:29.501
We've got a ticking man here.
He might turn any minute.

03:29.584 --> 03:32.170
Who said anything about turning?

03:32.546 --> 03:34.381
I'm fine. See?

04:03.493 --> 04:04.327
Let's get him inside.

04:05.495 --> 04:07.038
Zombies! Six o'clock!

04:08.331 --> 04:09.416
[growling]

04:15.380 --> 04:16.715
Eight thousand one.

04:24.639 --> 04:25.891
Right here, right here.

04:29.686 --> 04:31.354
-[moaning]
-How is he?

04:31.438 --> 04:33.565
Who knows? He's a walking petri dish.

04:33.648 --> 04:35.817
-Help him!
-There's not much we can do.

04:35.901 --> 04:37.611
He's not gonna turn on us, is he?

04:37.694 --> 04:38.904
What is he talking about?

04:38.987 --> 04:40.155
Don't worry.

04:40.238 --> 04:41.823
We got your heart started again.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.618
That is, if it was beating
in the first place.

04:44.701 --> 04:46.661
You've been in and out
of consciousness, man.

04:47.204 --> 04:49.581
Hey, maybe you're still immune.

04:49.831 --> 04:52.125
I've been cured six ways to hell and back.

04:52.876 --> 04:54.461
That's gotta be good for something, right?

04:54.544 --> 04:55.712
I hate to be a Debbie Downer,

04:55.796 --> 04:57.589
but I don't think
you're out of the woods yet.

04:57.881 --> 04:59.341
Maybe we should...

04:59.758 --> 05:01.593
I know. I was thinking the same thing.

05:01.676 --> 05:03.178
I think I'm gonna be sick, Doc.

05:03.261 --> 05:04.179
[Doc] We've got to do it now.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.098
[10k] I don't want to think about things
like this.

05:09.267 --> 05:11.102
I'm just tired...

05:11.311 --> 05:13.146
What are you two talking about?

05:13.355 --> 05:14.981
Nothing, you know, just...

05:15.065 --> 05:16.274
precautions.

05:19.778 --> 05:21.238
What are you doing?

05:21.321 --> 05:23.281
We can't just let him turn.
We need to restrain him.

05:23.365 --> 05:24.324
What? No!

05:24.533 --> 05:26.535
No! Warren, tell him to stop.

05:26.660 --> 05:27.869
He's crashing again.

05:28.578 --> 05:29.621
There he goes.

05:30.205 --> 05:31.122
[crying] No.

05:31.289 --> 05:32.749
-I don't feel a pulse.
-No.

05:36.002 --> 05:37.003
No!

05:38.588 --> 05:39.839
We have to save him.

05:40.090 --> 05:42.175
I know what you're thinking, but...

05:46.179 --> 05:48.056
-I have to try!
-Lucy, don't.

05:57.983 --> 05:59.234
-I got a pulse.
-[gasps]

06:11.621 --> 06:13.373
Bite him again. Bite him again.

06:26.511 --> 06:28.221
I'm not dead yet.

06:31.975 --> 06:33.059
No, you sure aren't.

06:34.477 --> 06:38.189
Lucy, I think it's working.
That Mad Z bite is looking better.

06:39.524 --> 06:41.151
Somebody better shut up these Zs

06:41.234 --> 06:42.527
before we draw more of a crowd.

06:43.278 --> 06:45.071
-Lieutenant?
-I'll go with you.

06:45.155 --> 06:47.073
-Need help?
-No, we got it.

06:47.407 --> 06:50.327
Stay here with Murphy
in case he needs help.

06:55.498 --> 06:56.583
Don't be a hero.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.168
-[growling]
-[gunshot]

07:00.378 --> 07:02.005
[muffled gunfire]

07:25.153 --> 07:27.989
Square key, two grooves. Square key...

07:39.751 --> 07:41.711
Come on, Murph. Stay with me, man.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.296
Doc, Doc,

07:43.880 --> 07:46.049
stop slapping me.

07:46.633 --> 07:48.426
-Sorry.
-Warren?

07:49.803 --> 07:51.388
[muffled growling]

07:52.973 --> 07:55.266
Man, I hate it when we split up.

07:55.517 --> 07:56.851
[gunfire]

08:34.431 --> 08:35.598
There.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.855
How you feeling?

08:42.564 --> 08:43.857
Actually, better.

08:44.649 --> 08:46.151
Thanks to my little girl.

08:46.901 --> 08:48.111
That's so weird.

08:48.611 --> 08:49.779
What is, Luce?

08:49.946 --> 08:51.614
My hands are all wrinkly.

09:08.548 --> 09:11.051
-Hey, go easy.
-I'm fine.

09:17.599 --> 09:19.476
Well, I'm better.

09:23.146 --> 09:24.189
Lucy.

09:25.982 --> 09:27.650
-Yeah, I know.
-My baby.

09:29.402 --> 09:30.445
What?

09:34.616 --> 09:36.076
OK. So...

09:39.746 --> 09:42.290
I've changed. I grew up.

09:42.999 --> 09:45.418
I mean it's happened before. It's just me.

09:46.252 --> 09:47.212
It's my business.

09:50.340 --> 09:52.842
Did this have something
to do with you aging?

09:53.218 --> 09:54.302
-No.
-Yes.

09:54.385 --> 09:56.346
Now Lucy, be honest.

09:56.471 --> 09:59.224
What difference does it make?
You're alive, aren't you?

09:59.599 --> 10:01.017
It's killing you.

10:01.518 --> 10:03.353
You can't do that again. Promise me.

10:03.478 --> 10:05.897
You are not the boss of me.

10:05.980 --> 10:07.690
Lucy, I am your...

10:11.319 --> 10:12.695
I'm your father.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.865
That means your life
is more important than mine.

10:16.366 --> 10:18.243
Your life is more... Blah blah blah.

10:19.577 --> 10:22.580
Why won't you let someone
save you for once,

10:22.664 --> 10:24.624
Mister Savior of all Mankind.

10:26.417 --> 10:27.836
Not anymore.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.424
-Lucy? What is it?
-It's...

10:33.633 --> 10:35.718
-It's Warren.
-Is she in trouble?

10:36.761 --> 10:38.096
I think so.

10:38.721 --> 10:40.515
Something's really strange.

10:40.723 --> 10:43.059
Well, she hasn't been herself,
that's for sure.

10:46.479 --> 10:47.814
Are you guys OK?

10:48.148 --> 10:49.399
Just a little M and M.

10:50.066 --> 10:52.277
-M and M?
-Mayhem and Mercy.

10:52.402 --> 10:54.779
-Where's Warren?
-That's a good question.

10:54.863 --> 10:57.448
-She's on another one of her walkabouts.
-Something's wrong.

10:58.241 --> 10:59.576
We need to find her.

10:59.659 --> 11:00.702
She went out that door.

11:00.785 --> 11:01.995
Go see if she needs backup.

11:02.078 --> 11:04.330
I'm gonna stay here with Murphy and Lulu
in case she comes back.

11:04.831 --> 11:05.832
Roger.

11:25.685 --> 11:26.728
Clear.

11:26.895 --> 11:27.979
What's that smell?

11:31.608 --> 11:32.567
Death?

11:32.650 --> 11:34.027
No, worse.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.987
I smell something living.

12:27.747 --> 12:28.665
This way.

12:32.460 --> 12:34.462
-That doesn't sound good.
-Warren.

12:36.172 --> 12:37.715
You should go help them find her.

12:37.882 --> 12:39.842
-What about you?
-I'll be fine.

12:40.259 --> 12:41.219
Really?

12:41.386 --> 12:42.387
I promise.

12:43.179 --> 12:44.180
[clank]

12:45.056 --> 12:46.432
And no biting.

12:46.975 --> 12:48.393
Go.

12:48.476 --> 12:49.852
[clank]

14:29.535 --> 14:30.995
[growling]

14:37.710 --> 14:39.629
-You look just like your mother.
-[scoffs]

14:40.838 --> 14:41.923
Except blue.

14:44.050 --> 14:46.052
-Her name was Serena.
-I know.

14:46.302 --> 14:47.637
Addy told me.

14:48.679 --> 14:51.057
So, you've heard the story.

14:51.182 --> 14:53.893
Two versions of it, Addy's and Doc's.

14:54.685 --> 14:55.937
Don't trust either one.

14:58.106 --> 14:59.482
What is the truth?

15:06.823 --> 15:08.408
Your mother was...

15:10.952 --> 15:12.662
living with a group of women for...

15:13.621 --> 15:14.872
for self-protection.

15:16.582 --> 15:17.875
That was four years ago,

15:18.918 --> 15:20.378
and things were still wild.

15:21.045 --> 15:22.338
What does that mean?

15:23.172 --> 15:25.091
Means we thought we were gonna die.

15:25.925 --> 15:29.137
There was no tomorrow.
We lived for the day.

15:29.220 --> 15:31.139
So you guys just hooked up?

15:31.556 --> 15:32.890
Where did you hear that?

15:32.974 --> 15:34.851
Addy. Same place I hear everything.

15:36.144 --> 15:37.603
She was a good friend.

15:38.896 --> 15:40.523
We all went through a lot together.

15:41.023 --> 15:42.024
Extenuating...

15:42.108 --> 15:43.234
Did you love her?

15:44.652 --> 15:45.653
Addy?

15:46.279 --> 15:48.448
I suppose, I mean in a way.

15:48.531 --> 15:49.907
No, my mother.

15:51.993 --> 15:53.369
Not at first.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.121
-It was--
-It was the Apocalypse,

15:55.204 --> 15:56.289
like Addy always says.

15:56.372 --> 15:59.417
When your mother and I
saw each other again,

16:01.252 --> 16:02.712
you were born.

16:04.839 --> 16:06.966
She was fiercely protective of you.

16:07.049 --> 16:09.594
She fought like a Honey Badger
to save you.

16:10.887 --> 16:13.097
Maybe that's why I always
want to hurt someone.

16:13.848 --> 16:14.682
No.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.226
I don't think that was her nature.

16:18.019 --> 16:20.897
I think the zombies just brought
out her motherly instinct.

16:23.316 --> 16:24.317
Hey?

16:25.985 --> 16:27.987
She would've been very proud of you.

16:31.073 --> 16:32.074
Yeah.

16:33.242 --> 16:34.494
But she died.

16:34.577 --> 16:35.745
Protecting you.

16:37.622 --> 16:38.873
Some things...

16:40.791 --> 16:42.418
Some things are worth dying for.

16:43.961 --> 16:46.088
You know what no one's
ever explained to me?

16:47.840 --> 16:49.258
What'd it mean,

16:49.800 --> 16:51.344
"there was pie?"

16:53.471 --> 16:54.639
[sighs]

16:57.058 --> 16:58.059
[gasps]

17:40.184 --> 17:41.352
[hissing]

18:33.446 --> 18:34.822
Left hands.

18:35.698 --> 18:37.783
Feet with and without toes.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.786
Assorted ears.

18:42.955 --> 18:43.998
Human?

18:45.124 --> 18:46.208
Zombie.

18:47.418 --> 18:48.961
That's appetizing.

18:49.712 --> 18:50.921
[growling]

18:57.553 --> 18:59.597
I don't know who's responsible for this,

19:00.640 --> 19:02.600
but I don't like them.

19:03.851 --> 19:05.186
Roger that.

19:07.855 --> 19:10.107
Did the Lieutenant
bring us here on purpose?

19:12.485 --> 19:13.778
-[rattling]
-Wait...

19:16.072 --> 19:16.947
Did you hear that?

19:18.824 --> 19:19.909
Yep.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.410
What do you think it was?

19:23.371 --> 19:24.789
Take your pick.

19:50.398 --> 19:51.482
OK.

20:39.989 --> 20:41.490
Doctor Caligari?

20:44.618 --> 20:45.786
[moans]

20:47.121 --> 20:50.124
Daddy. No, Daddy.
Please don't leave me. Please.

20:59.759 --> 21:01.844
No, you don't. Stop right there.

21:02.511 --> 21:04.138
But you will die.

21:04.221 --> 21:05.139
Then I'll die.

21:06.474 --> 21:07.767
But you got to save yourself.

21:08.017 --> 21:09.101
Daddy.

21:09.685 --> 21:10.811
Promise me.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.898
-No.
-Promise me you won't bite me.

21:14.940 --> 21:16.275
No.

21:16.358 --> 21:17.485
[crying] Lucy.

21:26.702 --> 21:29.288
You're the only thing
I ever cared about in this whole world.

21:29.705 --> 21:30.956
Besides me.

21:33.751 --> 21:35.252
You're one of a kind.

21:36.754 --> 21:38.547
Unique in the whole world.

21:40.716 --> 21:42.134
So do it, OK?

21:42.551 --> 21:43.886
Don't bite me again.

21:52.019 --> 21:53.270
Promise me.

22:19.129 --> 22:20.506
[muffled snarling]

22:24.468 --> 22:27.680
Great. More scientific shenanigans.

22:33.185 --> 22:34.937
You give a guy a lab coat

22:35.062 --> 22:37.231
and he'll screw things up every time.

22:38.148 --> 22:39.525
[growling]

22:39.608 --> 22:40.901
10K?

22:41.402 --> 22:42.611
Warren?

22:49.952 --> 22:50.953
What?

22:52.079 --> 22:53.497
You can't unsee that.

23:00.921 --> 23:01.755
No!

23:03.132 --> 23:04.842
Can't have too many of those.

23:07.469 --> 23:11.056
What in the zombie hell
were these people up to?

23:13.976 --> 23:16.437
Why does it always got
to be some crazy evil shit?

23:17.396 --> 23:20.107
Can't we for once just find a bakery?

23:20.399 --> 23:22.443
Maybe a working doughnut shop?

23:23.611 --> 23:27.364
Fully stocked dispensary?
I mean, is that too much to ask?

23:29.908 --> 23:31.201
Somebody there?

23:41.962 --> 23:43.088
[growling]

23:45.382 --> 23:46.216
Shit!

23:48.010 --> 23:50.596
Not fingers. Anything but fingers!

23:51.430 --> 23:53.349
Die! Die, fingers!

23:53.432 --> 23:56.560
Die! Die, fingers! Die!

23:57.436 --> 24:00.564
Die! Die, fingers! Die!

24:03.817 --> 24:06.654
What the hell?

24:06.820 --> 24:07.905
[panting]

24:10.240 --> 24:12.576
Get out of there! Where you going?

24:12.660 --> 24:15.621
[screams] Help! Help!

24:15.871 --> 24:17.206
-Doc?
-Get it out!

24:17.289 --> 24:18.582
It's us. What's wrong? What's the matter?

24:18.666 --> 24:20.542
Get it out! I can't deal, man!

24:20.626 --> 24:21.877
What's wrong? Get what out?

24:22.086 --> 24:23.420
I got a zombie finger inside me.

24:24.713 --> 24:26.090
What the fubar is that?

24:26.340 --> 24:28.217
A finger got in me. Get it out!

24:28.300 --> 24:30.010
I can't deal, man.
I got a thing about fingers.

24:30.094 --> 24:31.095
I'll have to cut it out.

24:31.178 --> 24:33.263
I don't care if you have to cut
off my legs. Just get it out.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.724
-Hold him down.
-Doc, hold still.

24:35.974 --> 24:37.726
I can't! I'm getting fingered!

24:39.186 --> 24:40.020
It's moving too fast.

24:40.145 --> 24:41.772
Hold on. Hold on.

24:43.357 --> 24:44.358
[groaning]

24:48.112 --> 24:49.321
OK, I got it. Cut it out!

24:50.239 --> 24:52.199
No! Cut it out!

24:53.575 --> 24:54.660
[screams]

24:54.743 --> 24:56.286
There it goes. Look out!

24:56.370 --> 24:58.455
Die, mother finger! Die!

25:01.542 --> 25:02.668
Is it dead?

25:03.669 --> 25:04.837
Dead, dead.

25:05.003 --> 25:06.755
Yeah, I don't like fingers.

25:06.839 --> 25:07.923
I know, Doc.

25:14.680 --> 25:15.723
Are you OK?

25:15.806 --> 25:17.850
I got two finger sized holes in my belly.

25:18.183 --> 25:19.643
Sorry, last one.

25:20.519 --> 25:21.770
Where were you guys?

25:22.020 --> 25:23.063
We were looking for Warren.

25:23.147 --> 25:25.315
But we heard you screaming for help,
so we came back.

25:25.441 --> 25:26.650
[rattling]

25:27.568 --> 25:29.361
Right before I broke that finger jar,

25:29.445 --> 25:31.196
I heard something. Something breathing.

25:31.280 --> 25:32.573
[rattling continues]

25:48.130 --> 25:49.548
What do you think it is?

25:50.799 --> 25:53.886
Judging by our surroundings, nothing good.

25:54.636 --> 25:57.264
Seems as afraid of us as we are of it.

25:57.848 --> 25:59.016
Where's Warren?

25:59.558 --> 26:00.851
Through that door.

26:01.310 --> 26:02.603
Well, don't shoot.

26:02.936 --> 26:04.897
Who knows what you're gonna wake up.

26:07.858 --> 26:09.193
Maybe we can go around.

26:11.445 --> 26:13.530
I don't think it likes it.

26:21.163 --> 26:22.206
[roars]

26:22.289 --> 26:23.916
-Watch it.
-I see him.

26:24.041 --> 26:25.167
That thing is big.

26:25.584 --> 26:26.919
Hello.

26:27.878 --> 26:29.880
Looks like we got ourselves a freak.

26:32.674 --> 26:34.343
Make that a super freak.

26:36.094 --> 26:37.137
[roars]

26:38.889 --> 26:40.891
-What is it?
-I dunno.

26:43.435 --> 26:46.313
Looks like some kinda damn Franken-Zombie.

26:49.858 --> 26:51.109
[continues roaring]

27:05.165 --> 27:06.375
[moans]

27:23.725 --> 27:24.977
Why am I here?

27:27.145 --> 27:27.980
There must be a reason.

27:35.112 --> 27:36.238
There must be a reason.

28:23.911 --> 28:25.037
You're OK.

28:25.579 --> 28:26.788
You're awake.

28:27.039 --> 28:28.206
It's OK.

28:29.333 --> 28:30.918
I'm so glad you're here.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.047
Have you seen our baby?

28:36.298 --> 28:37.466
What?

28:37.758 --> 28:40.677
Our little Lucy. Have you seen her?
She was just here.

28:42.137 --> 28:43.347
Serena,

28:44.264 --> 28:45.933
she's so beautiful.

28:47.809 --> 28:49.811
I think you're making a mistake, Daddy.

28:50.395 --> 28:51.897
I know, Mommy.

28:53.357 --> 28:56.193
I should never have
left you alone and pregnant.

28:57.611 --> 28:58.987
I'm so sorry.

29:01.740 --> 29:05.452
The biggest mistake of my life
was breaking up our family.

29:06.203 --> 29:09.873
It's OK. It's, it's...

29:12.042 --> 29:14.711
It's OK. You don't need
to worry about that, OK?

29:15.545 --> 29:18.423
I don't think our little Lucy's
ever gonna forgive me.

29:20.384 --> 29:23.929
And who could blame her,
leaving her with strangers like that.

29:26.306 --> 29:28.809
She'll forgive you, OK?
She'll forgive you.

29:31.228 --> 29:32.896
But she turned out OK.

29:35.816 --> 29:37.609
She's so strong.

29:38.110 --> 29:39.278
And brave.

29:40.070 --> 29:41.363
And blue.

29:44.157 --> 29:45.367
Where is she?

29:45.951 --> 29:47.286
She was just here.

29:49.121 --> 29:50.580
She was just here.

29:53.208 --> 29:55.335
She's gonna come back really soon, OK?

30:00.716 --> 30:02.134
Really soon.

30:04.011 --> 30:06.847
Did you ever think you could
love another person so much?

30:11.476 --> 30:12.644
No.

30:15.647 --> 30:16.815
She's the best.

30:19.943 --> 30:22.195
You're not so bad yourself,
my little baker.

30:26.867 --> 30:27.701
What's happening?

30:32.331 --> 30:34.249
[moans]

30:35.542 --> 30:37.002
[laughing] Blueberry pie.

30:37.085 --> 30:38.712
No, no, Daddy. No, no.

30:38.920 --> 30:41.381
Daddy, what's happening? No.

30:41.798 --> 30:44.384
Daddy, no. Daddy, please no, no.

30:44.468 --> 30:47.512
[screams] Doc! Warren! Somebody help me!

30:47.596 --> 30:48.972
[zombie roars]

31:20.754 --> 31:22.547
Did that zombie just shoot at us?

31:22.631 --> 31:24.674
That ain't no regular Z.

31:26.885 --> 31:28.261
[roars]

31:40.440 --> 31:42.526
How is this supposed to work anyway?

31:44.027 --> 31:45.195
Come on.

31:48.615 --> 31:51.493
Oh, God.

31:54.079 --> 31:56.456
You can't do this.
You can't leave me again.

31:56.540 --> 31:58.583
You can't leave me again!

31:59.543 --> 32:01.711
-[roars]
-[gasps]

32:34.077 --> 32:35.078
[Warren] Charlie?

32:36.204 --> 32:38.665
Charlie Bleeker, is that you?

32:46.298 --> 32:47.632
You are Charlie, aren't you?

32:52.929 --> 32:54.556
Where is Doctor Caligari?

32:58.518 --> 33:00.103
Do you understand me, Charlie?

33:02.731 --> 33:04.608
Is Doctor Caligari alive?

33:12.115 --> 33:13.283
Where is he, Charlie?

33:14.075 --> 33:15.577
Where is Doctor Caligari?

33:16.953 --> 33:18.330
[muffled] I'm here.

33:19.706 --> 33:21.750
Where are you, Doctor Caligari?

33:26.588 --> 33:29.841
I'm right in front of you.

33:46.816 --> 33:48.026
I feel great.

33:52.197 --> 33:53.365
Hey,

33:54.407 --> 33:56.493
Lucy. Hey Lucy, wake up.

33:57.160 --> 33:58.245
I'm cured.

34:04.501 --> 34:05.794
It's all because of my...

34:06.878 --> 34:08.129
Lucy?

34:08.505 --> 34:09.881
Is it you?

34:11.716 --> 34:13.301
Your little Lucy.

34:15.679 --> 34:16.846
Lucy,

34:17.430 --> 34:18.682
what have you done?

34:22.894 --> 34:23.728
No.

34:27.357 --> 34:30.318
It's all right, Daddy. It's OK.

34:33.572 --> 34:35.657
I can feel you again.

34:58.221 --> 35:00.765
What are you doing here?

35:07.022 --> 35:09.065
We came to see you, Doctor Caligari.

35:10.734 --> 35:12.611
How do you know my name?

35:14.154 --> 35:15.447
Your office.

35:16.031 --> 35:18.783
I saw a picture of you and Charlie.

35:20.535 --> 35:22.120
What do you want?

35:22.787 --> 35:24.247
Do you know me?

35:24.497 --> 35:26.082
Come closer.

35:37.302 --> 35:38.136
No.

35:40.889 --> 35:42.599
I've never been here before?

35:42.682 --> 35:46.019
I'm certain you've never been here before.

35:50.899 --> 35:52.317
Then how'd I get this?

35:54.027 --> 35:56.780
That was locked up in my office.

35:56.863 --> 35:58.823
Yeah, and somehow I knew the combination.

35:58.907 --> 36:00.492
But I don't know what this is.

36:01.618 --> 36:04.412
If you knew what I know,

36:04.913 --> 36:09.209
you'd be a very dangerous woman.

36:09.709 --> 36:12.045
She already is a dangerous woman.

36:13.338 --> 36:14.339
[snarls]

36:14.422 --> 36:15.298
Just saying.

36:20.428 --> 36:21.805
What happened to you?

36:22.972 --> 36:27.352
My knowledge exceeded my wisdom.

36:28.603 --> 36:30.897
We were experimenting with

36:30.980 --> 36:34.401
grafting zombie tissue onto humans,

36:35.193 --> 36:39.948
hoping to pass on their
superior genetic qualities.

36:41.199 --> 36:42.701
A love of brains?

36:42.867 --> 36:45.120
Immortality.

36:46.079 --> 36:47.455
That's insane.

36:47.914 --> 36:50.709
In retrospect.

36:50.792 --> 36:52.168
[growls]

36:54.629 --> 36:56.005
What about Charlie?

36:56.881 --> 36:59.467
How did you two happen?

36:59.843 --> 37:04.639
Charles and I were bitten by
one of the other assistants...

37:12.021 --> 37:13.982
<i>Who became infected and turned.</i>

37:15.942 --> 37:19.446
<i>It was too late to save Charlie.</i>

37:22.991 --> 37:26.494
<i>But I managed to chop off my own hand...</i>

37:28.413 --> 37:30.749
<i>before the infection spread.</i>

37:31.916 --> 37:35.712
<i>After... Charlie was mercied,</i>

37:36.171 --> 37:38.882
<i>I used my limb grafting discovery</i>

37:40.049 --> 37:44.012
<i>to attach his zombie hand to my arm.</i>

37:45.096 --> 37:47.682
<i>His zombie hand became a part of my body,</i>

37:48.725 --> 37:53.313
<i>passing on his natural zombie immunity.</i>

37:53.521 --> 37:56.524
But something went wrong.

37:57.275 --> 38:01.404
Instead of his hand
becoming part of my body,

38:01.654 --> 38:05.366
the zombie cells grew out of control.

38:06.493 --> 38:09.704
I knew Charlie was growing from the hand,

38:09.788 --> 38:13.416
taking over my body as its host.

38:13.875 --> 38:16.628
That was five years ago.

38:19.631 --> 38:20.590
This...

38:21.758 --> 38:23.718
is all that's left of me.

38:32.519 --> 38:35.271
Why would someone send me here
to find this?

38:36.523 --> 38:39.234
You'll have to ask them.

38:42.946 --> 38:44.030
[gasps]

38:48.076 --> 38:49.369
We got to go.

38:49.494 --> 38:50.328
Wait.

38:53.331 --> 38:55.625
I need something from you.

39:00.171 --> 39:01.631
You have to...

39:28.324 --> 39:29.617
We give you mercy.

39:43.715 --> 39:45.425
Don't cry, Daddy.

39:46.426 --> 39:47.969
I'll try not to.

39:48.845 --> 39:50.471
It's all right.

39:51.306 --> 39:52.557
How are you feeling?

39:54.434 --> 39:56.394
I can hear my heartbeat.

39:57.437 --> 39:58.813
I can feel it.

40:00.523 --> 40:02.859
It's all right. It's OK.

40:03.526 --> 40:04.944
It's almost over.

40:06.362 --> 40:07.572
Don't say that.

40:10.867 --> 40:12.410
I had a good life.

40:13.244 --> 40:14.162
My life.

40:19.292 --> 40:21.836
I promised Addy

40:22.462 --> 40:24.172
that we'd all stick together.

40:24.547 --> 40:27.216
I'm right here. I'm right here.

40:27.508 --> 40:30.178
You tell Addy I tried.

41:47.130 --> 41:48.423
Let's get her out of here.
