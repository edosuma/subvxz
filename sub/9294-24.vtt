00:11.061 --> 00:13.621
<i>Previously on</i> 24.

00:13.696 --> 00:16.597
Before his death,
Jonas Hodges told <i>us...</i>

00:16.666 --> 00:19.349
that there were other
parties involved with him

00:19.350 --> 00:21.194
in the creation of this bioweapon.

00:21.271 --> 00:23.796
<i>The F.B.I. has apprehended
Tony Almeida.</i>

00:23.873 --> 00:26.307
He is a key figure in this plot.

00:26.376 --> 00:29.504
Jonas Hodges was killed outside
F.B.I. <i>Headquarters...</i>

00:29.579 --> 00:32.207
and Ms. Taylor might be involved.

00:32.281 --> 00:33.498
<i>Olivia's capable of many things,</i>

00:33.499 --> 00:35.479
<i>but I can't believe committing
murder is one of them.</i>

00:35.552 --> 00:38.419
<i> I need you to access</i>
<i>the digital recording system-</i>

00:38.488 --> 00:42.007
<i>to see if their
conversation was recorded.</i>

00:42.292 --> 00:44.285
<i>
What I can't live with is that</i>

00:44.286 --> 00:45.557
<i>monster getting
away with this.</i>

00:45.628 --> 00:47.653
My operatives are with your daughter.

00:47.730 --> 00:50.563
In fact, I'm looking at her right now.

00:50.633 --> 00:52.201
You will help Tony Almeida escape,

00:52.202 --> 00:54.000
or my people will
murder your daughter.

00:54.070 --> 00:57.528
- Don't move!
- Jack, why?

00:57.607 --> 01:00.235
<i>The people that are working with Tony</i>
<i>have operatives with Kim right now.</i>

01:00.310 --> 01:01.891
<i>They've threatened to kill her</i>
<i>if I don't break him out.</i>

01:04.947 --> 01:06.515
<i> The people who
were watching you-</i>

01:06.516 --> 01:08.213
<i>they're our only lead
to finding your father.</i>

01:12.388 --> 01:15.255
That laptop has the camera
that they were using to track me.

01:15.325 --> 01:17.759
We may be able to backtrace to
the people that have my father.

01:17.827 --> 01:19.761
Your people are gonna
be able to <i>launch...</i>

01:19.829 --> 01:22.093
their biological attacks
just as they originally planned.

01:22.165 --> 01:24.099
- <i>How?</i>
- <i>We have Jack.</i>

01:24.167 --> 01:25.498
The pathogen's in his organs.

01:25.568 --> 01:28.162
<i>We'll be able to harvest everything</i>
<i>we need from his body.</i>

01:28.238 --> 01:29.830
Tony believes in what we're doing.

01:29.906 --> 01:33.774
Are you suggesting I meet with him?

01:33.843 --> 01:35.571
<i>I'll look Almeida in the eye,</i>

01:35.572 --> 01:38.212
<i>and if for any reason
I don't like what I see...</i>

01:38.281 --> 01:40.579
I can't let him walk out of
that meeting alive.

01:40.650 --> 01:42.277
How much longer does he have?

01:42.352 --> 01:44.343
<i> Couple of hours,</i>
<i> give or take.</i>

01:44.420 --> 01:46.581
<i>The pathogen can survive up</i>
<i>to two hours after death.</i>

01:46.656 --> 01:49.250
In fact, the only sure way
to destroy it is by <i>exposure...</i>

01:49.325 --> 01:51.623
to extreme temperatures
above 500 degrees Celsius.

01:51.694 --> 01:53.218
Get him ready to move.

<i> The following takes place</i>
<i>between 7:00 a.m. And 8:00 a.m.</i>

02:17.792 --> 02:19.553
Tell me if you need
more people on this

02:19.616 --> 02:20.814
and I will get them
for you.

02:20.896 --> 02:22.655
We don't need people.
We need to get lucky.

02:22.719 --> 02:24.283
The transmitter node
on the laptop is encrypted

02:24.349 --> 02:25.323
with multiple relays.

02:25.388 --> 02:26.764
Can you source
the transmission or not?

02:26.829 --> 02:28.763
I'm trying to come up
with a work-around.

02:28.829 --> 02:31.002
Call me as soon as
you have something.

02:31.067 --> 02:32.202
They still can't source
the transmission?

02:32.266 --> 02:33.434
They're working on it.

02:33.499 --> 02:35.303
Chloe and Janis are doing
everything that they can.

02:35.367 --> 02:37.991
Is there no other lead, no
other way to find my father?

02:38.073 --> 02:39.126
This is
a good lead, Kim.

02:39.193 --> 02:40.903
The only reason we have it
is 'cause of you.

02:40.967 --> 02:42.372
Yeah, except my father's dying.

02:42.441 --> 02:45.480
And we don't know how much
time he has left.

04:35.614 --> 04:37.740
Come in.

04:40.509 --> 04:43.144
What are you still doing here?

04:43.207 --> 04:46.117
Just finishing up
the conversation

04:46.182 --> 04:47.686
we started.

04:49.015 --> 04:50.726
Aaron,

04:50.790 --> 04:53.588
I told you to escort
Ethan to the gate.

04:53.655 --> 04:55.525
Now take him out of my office
and off the White House grounds.

04:55.589 --> 04:58.691
No, ma'am, I am not

04:58.756 --> 05:00.288
gonna do that.

05:00.353 --> 05:01.455
I'm calling security.

05:07.168 --> 05:09.760
Having me dig up dirt
on Noah Daniels is one thing.

05:09.842 --> 05:12.334
This is a whole
different animal.

05:12.397 --> 05:13.838
I'm aware of that, Martin.

05:13.903 --> 05:17.133
I want this to happen. I want
this person taken care of.

05:17.200 --> 05:19.212
Mm-hmm.
It's Jonas Hodges.

05:23.886 --> 05:27.547
The digital card you confiscated
from me was blank.

05:27.612 --> 05:32.088
I gave the real one
to Agent Pierce.

05:34.455 --> 05:37.157
How long
have you known, Aaron?

05:37.222 --> 05:43.589
I had my suspicions, ma'am,
but I was hoping I was wrong.

05:46.661 --> 05:49.588
I'll wait outside, sir.

05:54.930 --> 05:58.460
Ethan, this doesn't tell
the whole story.

05:58.529 --> 06:00.671
Sounds pretty clear to me.

06:00.734 --> 06:03.100
Hodges is dead,
you're responsible.

06:03.165 --> 06:05.867
I know, but I tried
to stop it from happening.

06:05.934 --> 06:08.378
Oh, save it, Olivia!

06:08.443 --> 06:12.137
You can't talk your way out of
this situation, not this time.

06:14.842 --> 06:16.406
All right, Ethan...

06:19.049 --> 06:19.976
You win.

06:20.040 --> 06:22.584
I'll resign.

06:22.647 --> 06:24.551
Come up with some excuse.

06:24.614 --> 06:26.550
You could have your job again.

06:26.613 --> 06:27.588
Everything will go...

06:27.654 --> 06:29.347
This isn't about
getting my job back!

06:29.426 --> 06:31.186
It's about the truth!

06:31.251 --> 06:34.849
The truth could destroy
my mother's administration.

06:34.931 --> 06:37.390
I am fully aware
of the implications

06:37.457 --> 06:39.023
if this goes public.

06:39.087 --> 06:42.222
You don't have to
spell them out for me.

06:42.287 --> 06:44.221
Then what do you want?

06:48.671 --> 06:51.005
For the president
to take the next step.

06:51.070 --> 06:54.846
Whether she decides to prosecute
this or bury it,

06:54.909 --> 06:55.867
that's her call.

06:55.932 --> 06:59.738
But she needs to know
the truth.

07:02.074 --> 07:04.983
I'll let you tell her
yourself.

07:10.344 --> 07:11.784
I can't believe
you're doing this.

07:11.848 --> 07:16.246
You're betraying everything
that you've ever worked for.

07:16.326 --> 07:18.485
I know you think this country
failed you,

07:18.549 --> 07:21.093
and I don't care what kind of
ideology you believe in now.

07:21.156 --> 07:22.820
This is no way
to fight for it.

07:22.902 --> 07:23.861
What you're doing
is wrong.

07:23.926 --> 07:25.299
This is wrong,
and you know it!

07:25.364 --> 07:28.772
Damn it, Tony, look at me!

07:33.503 --> 07:36.302
Please...

07:36.368 --> 07:39.405
as someone who was once
your friend...

07:39.471 --> 07:42.766
let me die in peace.

07:42.848 --> 07:45.708
Don't let them use me
to kill innocent people.

07:45.774 --> 07:49.210
I have no intention
of letting them use you

07:49.273 --> 07:50.440
as a pathogen, Jack.

07:50.504 --> 07:53.416
I never did.

07:53.480 --> 07:55.881
I overheard you.
This was your idea.

07:55.944 --> 07:57.381
You sold it to them.

07:57.448 --> 07:59.413
It was just a play.

07:59.478 --> 08:01.928
A play?

08:01.991 --> 08:04.022
To get the man who's coming here
right now.

08:05.590 --> 08:08.388
Took me three years
to find him.

08:08.453 --> 08:09.734
Took me another year

08:09.799 --> 08:11.426
to get him to meet me
face-to-face.

08:11.492 --> 08:13.828
I had to prove
myself to him

08:13.893 --> 08:16.322
by taking down
Jonas Hodges.

08:16.404 --> 08:20.100
I had to convince him that I was
a true believer in his cause.

08:20.164 --> 08:21.972
What the hell are
you talking about?

08:22.036 --> 08:27.504
His name is Alan Wilson.

08:27.568 --> 08:30.272
He was the man behind
Charles Logan.

08:30.336 --> 08:34.381
He's the one who ordered
the hit on David Palmer,

08:34.445 --> 08:36.604
and he had Michelle killed
to cover his tracks.

08:36.687 --> 08:38.909
This is the man
who murdered my wife, Jack.

08:38.988 --> 08:42.347
Everything that you've done
today is for personal revenge?

08:42.410 --> 08:43.979
It's about justice.

08:44.046 --> 08:47.883
Justice. You killed
innocent people, Tony!

08:47.947 --> 08:50.651
Ten times as many people would
have died if it hadn't

08:50.731 --> 08:52.763
been for me.
The deeper I dug

08:52.827 --> 08:55.622
to find the person responsible
for Michelle's death,

08:55.691 --> 08:59.190
the more I kept running
into men like Jonas Hodges.

08:59.256 --> 09:02.198
They're the ones with the
crazy ideology, Jack, not me.

09:02.263 --> 09:04.324
I'm the one who had a plan
to bring them down.

09:04.406 --> 09:06.468
I'd enlisted Bill
and Chloe to help me

09:06.532 --> 09:08.003
track all the elements
of this group.

09:08.069 --> 09:10.742
And when I finally got
what I wanted,

09:10.804 --> 09:13.043
they would turn 'em in
and shut 'em down.

09:13.106 --> 09:14.866
But you screwed

09:14.947 --> 09:17.567
that all up,
didn't you, Jack?

09:17.650 --> 09:23.743
You see, I'm the one who saved
lives today, Jack, not you.

09:23.808 --> 09:26.814
I'm the one who helped
you recover the CIP device

09:26.879 --> 09:29.213
I'm the one who warned you
about the White House attacks,

09:29.277 --> 09:31.182
I'm the one who stopped
Jonas Hodges

09:31.246 --> 09:32.523
from launching
those missiles!

09:32.589 --> 09:34.156
You tell yourself
whatever you want.

09:34.221 --> 09:36.124
You launched a biological
attack

09:36.188 --> 09:37.258
on Washington Center Station,

09:37.322 --> 09:39.257
and if we hadn't gotten
there in time,

09:39.323 --> 09:41.385
thousands of innocent people
would have been killed!

09:41.467 --> 09:45.161
I did what I had to do
to get Alan Wilson there.

09:45.225 --> 09:50.629
And now he's gonna die.

09:50.697 --> 09:54.405
You kill him, and no one will
ever know the full extent

09:54.470 --> 09:56.776
of this conspiracy.

09:58.469 --> 10:01.270
I'm not gonna kill him, Jack...

10:05.047 --> 10:06.275
You are.

10:11.987 --> 10:14.542
Damn you, Tony.
Damn you.

10:14.625 --> 10:17.152
I'm sorry that it
has to be you,

10:17.217 --> 10:19.614
but the truth is,
they wouldn't let me

10:19.699 --> 10:21.519
within 50 feet
of the guy.

10:21.583 --> 10:25.087
You're the one he's coming for.

10:25.168 --> 10:28.061
You're not honoring
Michelle's life.

10:28.125 --> 10:31.870
You are reveling in her death,
and she would

10:31.934 --> 10:33.101
despise
you for this.

11:01.619 --> 11:02.788
We're clear.

11:04.819 --> 11:06.592
When's Wilson coming?

11:06.656 --> 11:07.646
Soon.

11:07.732 --> 11:09.630
He wants to see
Bauer's medical record.

11:09.694 --> 11:11.707
It's right over there.

11:39.849 --> 11:43.117
Wilson doesn't know
about us.

11:43.197 --> 11:45.907
And it's best to keep it
that way, at least for now.

11:47.910 --> 11:50.583
Sure.

11:50.651 --> 11:52.653
I understand.

11:55.618 --> 11:57.668
He's here.

11:59.770 --> 12:01.979
Ready?

12:02.045 --> 12:04.046
Yeah.

12:07.092 --> 12:09.095
Let's go.

13:05.173 --> 13:06.676
Put your hands behind your head.

13:25.460 --> 13:27.240
We're all clear, sir.

13:57.483 --> 13:59.949
That's far enough for you.

14:02.258 --> 14:04.132
Hello,

14:04.197 --> 14:06.201
Cara.

14:08.715 --> 14:10.351
This is Tony Almeida.

14:10.415 --> 14:12.723
I've been looking forward
to this, sir.

14:12.787 --> 14:14.293
Yes, I know.

14:15.558 --> 14:17.674
Where's Bauer?

14:17.738 --> 14:18.700
Right inside.

14:18.780 --> 14:20.974
Second door
on the right.

14:21.042 --> 14:23.045
Need this.

14:29.440 --> 14:33.573
So Cara thinks you should
be playing a larger role

14:33.653 --> 14:35.721
in our
organization.

14:35.785 --> 14:37.117
You've been
an asset.

14:37.199 --> 14:38.558
Thank you, sir.

14:38.623 --> 14:41.571
But I believe there's a lot more
I can bring to the table.

14:45.016 --> 14:46.746
But first,

14:46.810 --> 14:49.119
I want to see
Bauer's pathology report.

14:49.184 --> 14:50.624
I have it right here.

14:59.825 --> 15:01.283
This is the FBI!

15:01.348 --> 15:03.254
You're surrounded!

15:03.320 --> 15:04.489
Lay down your weapons!

15:04.569 --> 15:05.992
Come on.
- Fire at will!

15:06.059 --> 15:08.304
I repeat, lay down your weapons!

15:09.538 --> 15:10.547
Tony!

15:29.525 --> 15:30.900
Set us down.

16:12.476 --> 16:16.222
I need you to get me
to that green van! Go!

16:30.117 --> 16:31.559
Jack.

16:33.259 --> 16:34.846
Stay away from me;
I'm wired with C4.

16:34.910 --> 16:36.544
Tony's got
the detonator.

16:36.609 --> 16:37.586
Stay away!

16:37.650 --> 16:39.219
Wait, I know
this trigger mechanism.

16:39.284 --> 16:41.191
I can disarm it.

16:41.254 --> 16:42.649
Where's Kim?

16:42.731 --> 16:44.924
She's safe.

16:45.007 --> 16:47.103
She's the reason
we were able to find you.

16:47.168 --> 16:48.548
Tony's been playing
both sides all along.

16:48.612 --> 16:50.116
You need to stop him.

16:50.181 --> 16:51.847
He's trying to kill the man
who's behind this conspiracy.

16:51.912 --> 16:53.257
His name is Alan Wilson.

16:53.322 --> 16:56.430
He was responsible for
killing Tony's wife Michelle.

16:56.498 --> 16:57.891
That's why he's
doing this.

16:57.971 --> 16:59.638
You want to end
this for good,

16:59.702 --> 17:01.944
you need to stop Tony
from killing him.

17:02.008 --> 17:05.116
Otherwise, you're gonna lose any
chance of exposing the others.

17:05.181 --> 17:06.288
Okay, you're clear.

17:10.696 --> 17:12.876
Let's go.

17:17.718 --> 17:20.455
Woodside
Industrial Complex.

17:20.522 --> 17:23.005
We're at the southeast quadrant
on our way to the perimeter.

17:23.069 --> 17:25.008
Call me when you have
an exfiltration point.

17:25.071 --> 17:27.780
How did this happen?

17:27.845 --> 17:28.951
How did they track us?

17:29.015 --> 17:30.889
I don't know.

17:36.709 --> 17:37.878
Tony!

17:41.546 --> 17:43.985
Thank God you're okay.

17:44.066 --> 17:45.426
The extraction team
will be here soon,

17:45.490 --> 17:46.498
but we got to move.

18:06.183 --> 18:09.195
It took me a long time
to find you.

18:11.730 --> 18:14.307
To peel back all the layers
of people you hide behind.

18:16.344 --> 18:19.727
But I stayed patient.

18:19.792 --> 18:23.893
Because ever since the
day you had her killed,

18:23.973 --> 18:26.875
the only thing
that kept me alive

18:26.939 --> 18:28.315
was this moment right here.

18:28.379 --> 18:30.413
Mm, you sound like
you were involved in

18:30.478 --> 18:33.734
some kind of a tragedy, but
I had nothing to do with it.

18:41.107 --> 18:44.296
See, Michelle
and me

18:44.358 --> 18:46.026
had gotten out
of all this.

18:48.063 --> 18:51.139
We made it out together.

18:51.203 --> 18:54.182
And we were gonna start
a whole new life.

18:54.247 --> 18:57.451
Until you
came along

18:57.517 --> 18:59.391
and took it
all away

18:59.457 --> 19:01.831
in a split second.

19:12.326 --> 19:14.631
It wasn't just my wife
you murdered.

19:16.379 --> 19:19.408
She was carrying my son.

19:25.341 --> 19:27.198
You killed my son!

19:27.280 --> 19:28.240
My son!

19:28.304 --> 19:30.516
And now

19:30.581 --> 19:33.511
I'm gonna kill you.

19:39.941 --> 19:42.376
Tony, don't move.

19:44.928 --> 19:47.361
Tony, don't move!

20:00.325 --> 20:02.472
Get him out of here.

20:08.483 --> 20:10.293
No!

20:10.358 --> 20:12.887
These people think they can take
everything away from us, Jack!

20:12.953 --> 20:14.556
Somebody had to stop them!

20:14.637 --> 20:15.726
And what'd you do, huh?!

20:15.806 --> 20:17.665
You ran away!

20:17.747 --> 20:19.572
That's right,
you ran away, Jack!

20:19.638 --> 20:21.752
You're one of them now!

20:21.817 --> 20:23.228
Congratulations!

20:23.293 --> 20:25.168
How would Teri feel about that,

20:25.233 --> 20:27.058
huh, Jack?! Huh?!

20:27.142 --> 20:29.541
You lost
your nerve!

20:31.546 --> 20:33.182
You're a
coward, Jack!

21:13.762 --> 21:17.806
A lot of people died today
because of you.

21:17.873 --> 21:19.844
Including someone close to me.

21:21.756 --> 21:25.093
You will be charged with treason
and conspiracy to launch

21:25.173 --> 21:27.374
terrorist attacks
against this country.

21:27.439 --> 21:28.881
The only way
that I see you

21:28.945 --> 21:30.920
avoiding the death penalty
is by cooperating.

21:34.276 --> 21:36.250
Tell me who else
is involved in this conspiracy,

21:36.314 --> 21:38.092
and I will make sure
that your cooperation

21:38.158 --> 21:40.837
is taken into account
by the grand jury.

21:40.903 --> 21:43.504
Hmm.

21:43.584 --> 21:46.760
How can I cooperate if I have no
idea what you're talking about?

21:48.029 --> 21:50.342
It's not gonna work, Wilson.

21:50.407 --> 21:53.551
Whatever this conspiracy is

21:53.616 --> 21:57.001
that you think that
I'm a part of, I guarantee

21:57.066 --> 22:02.333
you won't find a shred of material
evidence connecting me to it.

22:02.397 --> 22:06.038
In the eyes of the law,
I'm an innocent man.

22:06.102 --> 22:07.336
You son of a bitch!

22:08.383 --> 22:10.321
Anything else you need to say,

22:10.390 --> 22:12.329
you can say to my attorneys.

22:12.398 --> 22:13.535
Ma'am.

22:13.601 --> 22:14.579
They're almost ready

22:14.644 --> 22:16.117
to take Bauer
to the hospital.

22:16.183 --> 22:18.157
You wanted
a heads up.

22:26.826 --> 22:29.475
Hm. Hm.

22:29.538 --> 22:30.613
I'm giving you Hydromorphone

22:30.679 --> 22:32.280
to make the ride to
the hospital easier.

22:32.344 --> 22:33.695
It'll make you
a little sleepy,

22:33.760 --> 22:36.101
but it will break the pain cycle.
- No, not yet.

22:36.165 --> 22:37.467
Please.

22:38.880 --> 22:40.726
Jack.

22:44.771 --> 22:46.536
Could you give us a moment?

22:46.618 --> 22:48.655
Dr. Macer wants you
at the hospital.

22:48.719 --> 22:50.997
It's all right,
she can wait.

22:51.062 --> 22:53.807
Thank you.

22:57.789 --> 22:59.730
What happened?

22:59.794 --> 23:01.736
He's denying everything.

23:01.800 --> 23:04.913
Claims that we don't
have a case against him.

23:04.994 --> 23:06.565
Is he right?

23:06.632 --> 23:08.299
Maybe.

23:08.363 --> 23:10.577
Which means he has
absolutely no reason

23:10.644 --> 23:13.821
to tell us who else is
involved in this with him.

23:13.887 --> 23:15.971
But I can make him talk.

23:16.036 --> 23:18.378
If we don't find
these people,

23:18.442 --> 23:19.920
one day they <i>will</i>
launch another attack,

23:19.986 --> 23:22.118
and I don't see how I
can live with myself

23:22.184 --> 23:24.833
knowing that there was something
I could have done to stop it.

23:30.468 --> 23:32.732
I don't know what to do.

23:34.607 --> 23:37.048
I can't tell you what to do.

23:37.130 --> 23:41.237
I've been wrestling with
this one my whole life.

23:41.301 --> 23:44.414
I-I see 15 people
held hostage on a bus,

23:44.480 --> 23:46.824
and everything else
goes out the window.

23:46.905 --> 23:49.777
And I will do whatever it takes
to save them, and I mean

23:49.842 --> 23:51.847
whatever it takes.

23:56.101 --> 23:59.246
I guess maybe I thought...

23:59.311 --> 24:02.294
if I save them...

24:02.360 --> 24:04.702
I'd save myself.

24:06.148 --> 24:08.617
Do you regret anything
that you did today?

24:13.306 --> 24:16.051
No.

24:17.288 --> 24:20.368
Then again, I don't
work for the FBI.

24:20.435 --> 24:22.312
I don't understand.

24:22.376 --> 24:25.218
You took an oath.

24:25.299 --> 24:28.602
You made a promise
to uphold the law.

24:30.849 --> 24:32.024
When you cross that line,

24:32.089 --> 24:33.998
it always starts off
with a small step.

24:34.063 --> 24:36.677
Before you know it, you're
running as fast as you can

24:36.742 --> 24:37.881
in the wrong direction

24:37.945 --> 24:41.557
just to justify what you
started in the first place.

24:41.622 --> 24:43.131
These laws were written

24:43.197 --> 24:45.138
by much smarter men than me.

24:45.204 --> 24:47.657
And in the end,
I know that these laws

24:47.722 --> 24:50.899
have to be more important
than the 15 people on the bus.

24:50.963 --> 24:52.315
I know that's right.

24:52.379 --> 24:53.517
In my mind,

24:53.581 --> 24:57.369
I know that's right.

24:57.436 --> 25:02.154
I just don't think my heart
could ever have lived with it.

25:05.461 --> 25:09.473
I guess the only advice
I can give you is...

25:11.320 --> 25:14.672
...try to make choices
that you can live with.

25:24.513 --> 25:26.856
I don't know what to say.

25:36.361 --> 25:39.968
Don't say anything at all.

25:48.477 --> 25:51.718
Mr. Bauer, we
really need to go.

26:23.729 --> 26:24.799
Henry!

26:24.863 --> 26:28.303
What are you
doing out of bed?

26:32.460 --> 26:35.100
What's going on?

26:35.163 --> 26:37.831
Olivia wouldn't say
until you got here.

26:45.573 --> 26:48.465
You'll understand
when I tell you.

26:48.545 --> 26:51.471
It's gonna be hard enough
to say once.

26:51.535 --> 26:54.269
I'm listening, Livy.

26:54.334 --> 26:56.347
What's this about?

27:00.776 --> 27:02.774
Jonas Hodges.

27:05.207 --> 27:07.315
He's dead because of me.

27:07.380 --> 27:09.618
Oh, Livy,

27:09.683 --> 27:11.649
don't tell me
you were the one

27:11.714 --> 27:13.646
who leaked
the information.

27:13.711 --> 27:16.080
It's worse than that.

27:16.144 --> 27:18.621
Olivia...

27:18.684 --> 27:20.891
talk to us.

27:25.817 --> 27:27.848
He killed Roger.

27:31.560 --> 27:34.818
Hodges killed my brother.

27:34.884 --> 27:38.291
And then <i>you</i> agreed to put him
into witness protection.

27:38.355 --> 27:40.592
And the thought
of him getting away

27:40.657 --> 27:42.288
was too much for me.

27:48.207 --> 27:50.491
So I called Martin Collier.

27:50.572 --> 27:53.275
Head once...

27:53.338 --> 27:57.494
told me he knew someone
who could do this kind of thing.

27:59.797 --> 28:02.133
You're saying...
Collier hired someone

28:02.198 --> 28:04.979
to kill Jonas Hodges?

28:06.210 --> 28:08.399
No.

28:08.465 --> 28:10.176
I did.

28:12.240 --> 28:13.983
I tried calling it off,

28:14.048 --> 28:16.975
but it was too late, and
everything was happening so fast.

28:17.039 --> 28:18.973
Olivia...

28:19.053 --> 28:21.179
who else knows about this?

28:21.243 --> 28:23.719
Ethan.

28:23.784 --> 28:26.645
He has a recording

28:26.710 --> 28:29.222
of my conversation
with Martin.

28:29.285 --> 28:32.847
He's agreed not to turn it over
to the attorney general.

28:32.912 --> 28:37.247
He says he'll respect whatever
you decide to do with the evidence.

28:39.581 --> 28:41.357
Mom, say something.

28:41.422 --> 28:44.061
How could you do this?!

28:44.125 --> 28:45.354
Olivia!

28:45.418 --> 28:47.384
How could you do
something so stupid?

28:47.450 --> 28:50.152
I'm sorry-- I tried to
call it off, I swear!

28:50.218 --> 28:52.484
It doesn't matter,
darling, it happened!

28:52.565 --> 28:53.794
For God's sake,

28:53.860 --> 28:55.729
Allison, stop
yelling at her.

28:55.795 --> 28:58.386
Hodges killed our son.

28:58.465 --> 29:00.496
I know what he did.

29:00.561 --> 29:05.231
Then you know if anyone
deserves to die, it's him.

29:05.294 --> 29:07.658
All you should be
thinking about now

29:07.725 --> 29:10.235
is how to protect
our daughter.

29:11.593 --> 29:13.799
Protect her?

29:13.864 --> 29:15.367
How?

29:15.433 --> 29:17.460
Destroy that recording.

29:17.543 --> 29:20.897
And cover up a murder?

29:20.962 --> 29:24.274
Henry, I can't just
disregard the law!

29:24.339 --> 29:27.104
Allison, spare me
your sanctimony.

29:27.169 --> 29:29.168
You're Olivia's mother.

29:29.248 --> 29:32.238
I'm also the president
of the United States.

29:32.304 --> 29:36.171
And our family's already paid
a steep enough price for that.

29:39.672 --> 29:41.910
What are you saying, Henry?

29:41.975 --> 29:45.142
You know exactly
what I'm saying.

29:45.208 --> 29:48.612
Your job cost our son hilife.

29:50.643 --> 29:54.321
That is a cruel thing to say.

29:55.712 --> 29:57.883
I couldn't have done
anything to prevent

29:57.948 --> 30:00.923
Roger's death.
- But you can do something about this.

30:02.093 --> 30:05.752
For God's sakes,
Allison...

30:05.816 --> 30:08.981
we've already
lost one child.

30:12.997 --> 30:14.961
I'm sorry to interrupt,
Madam President,

30:15.030 --> 30:16.866
but there's some news
from the Bureau

30:16.929 --> 30:19.424
you need to hear.

30:19.490 --> 30:22.031
Uh, good news.

30:26.556 --> 30:29.130
I'll be down in a moment, Tim.

30:31.098 --> 30:32.599
Yes, ma'am.

30:38.261 --> 30:40.273
Go, Allison.

30:41.666 --> 30:44.529
But so help me...

30:44.608 --> 30:46.733
destroy that recording...

30:46.797 --> 30:50.873
and save what's left
of this family.

30:55.210 --> 30:56.536
Go.

31:19.978 --> 31:22.824
Dad, what did I do?

31:26.519 --> 31:28.948
We're going to figure this out.

31:30.326 --> 31:32.754
I'm sorry.

31:32.819 --> 31:35.921
We'll figure it out.

31:39.264 --> 31:40.336
He's a high-value suspect--

31:40.400 --> 31:42.924
make sure you restrict
access until I get there.

31:42.988 --> 31:45.465
Agent Walker's bringing him back now.

31:45.531 --> 31:47.400
What's their ETA?
- About ten minutes.

31:47.466 --> 31:49.367
I'll be there in 20-- have
Wilson's transfer papers

31:49.432 --> 31:50.790
in order by then.
- Yes, sir.

31:52.789 --> 31:54.197
Excuse me, Chloe?

31:54.261 --> 31:56.960
I've got to work on
Wilson's transfer papers,

31:57.025 --> 31:59.138
so we're gonna have
to schedule debriefing

31:59.203 --> 32:02.030
for later.
- I can come back later, or tomorrow.

32:02.099 --> 32:03.296
You staying in town?

32:03.378 --> 32:05.136
I want to be
here for Jack.

32:06.765 --> 32:10.443
I'd like to thank you for
all the help you gave me today.

32:10.508 --> 32:12.663
Yeah, it was...
interesting.

32:12.746 --> 32:14.534
Given what you have
to work with,

32:14.600 --> 32:18.900
you're doing a
pretty good job.

32:18.980 --> 32:21.747
I'll take that as a compliment.
Thank you.

32:21.811 --> 32:24.879
Good. That's what it
was meant to be.

32:58.288 --> 33:00.492
Because the pathogen
was weaponized,

33:00.558 --> 33:03.196
the disease is at
an advanced stage.

33:04.699 --> 33:07.130
I'm sorry, Mr. Bauer.

33:07.195 --> 33:09.799
All I can do is administer
morphine, which will induce

33:09.863 --> 33:12.725
a coma, but you
won't feel any pain.

33:12.806 --> 33:15.236
No morphine.
Not yet, please.

33:22.208 --> 33:24.670
Yeah, it's all right.

33:30.236 --> 33:31.864
He'll see you now.

33:37.448 --> 33:39.605
I'll be outside.

33:49.615 --> 33:50.812
Thank you for coming.

33:50.877 --> 33:53.978
I was surprised
to get your call.

33:55.358 --> 33:58.650
I'm dying.

34:01.322 --> 34:02.712
I know.

34:05.782 --> 34:08.514
I made so many mistakes.

34:08.596 --> 34:11.283
And I always thought
that I would have the time

34:11.364 --> 34:13.329
to correct them.

34:18.370 --> 34:19.422
You have the time.

34:19.489 --> 34:22.157
Right now.

34:24.637 --> 34:28.170
You don't know what I've done.

34:29.498 --> 34:34.036
We live in complex
times, Mr. Bauer.

34:34.101 --> 34:37.876
Nothing is black and white.

34:37.938 --> 34:39.730
But I do know this.

34:39.812 --> 34:42.896
I see before me a man

34:42.976 --> 34:45.408
with all his flaws

34:45.474 --> 34:48.668
and all his goodness.

34:50.239 --> 34:53.387
Simply a man.

35:24.825 --> 35:26.829
Thank you.

35:37.986 --> 35:40.553
It's time.

36:04.419 --> 36:05.823
Olivia, come
and sit down.

36:05.889 --> 36:07.997
No, I can't.

36:48.305 --> 36:53.131
I never imagined
that this job would...

36:53.211 --> 36:55.573
would be so hard on both of you.

36:56.966 --> 36:59.264
I had no idea

36:59.331 --> 37:01.103
of the price
this family would pay.

37:02.864 --> 37:05.625
And for that, I am so sorry.

37:10.227 --> 37:13.103
But I have a sworn duty

37:13.168 --> 37:15.292
to enforce the Constitution.

37:18.392 --> 37:19.737
And failing to
honor that oath

37:19.801 --> 37:32.084
would be the worst
kind of hypocrisy.

37:32.148 --> 37:37.577
But as president,
this is what I have to do,

37:37.658 --> 37:40.614
no matter how much
it breaks my heart.

37:43.618 --> 37:48.220
Agent Pierce will remand
you to federal custody.

38:04.150 --> 38:06.946
Ma'am, I am escorting

38:07.010 --> 38:10.364
you to the
Justice Department,

38:10.445 --> 38:13.366
where you will be held
until formal charges

38:13.430 --> 38:15.665
have been issued.

38:32.828 --> 38:34.233
I'm sorry, honey.

38:52.193 --> 38:54.924
Henry...

39:43.333 --> 39:44.498
Allison?

39:46.835 --> 39:50.330
Um, if you'd like
to talk later, um...

39:50.394 --> 39:51.993
No.

39:57.121 --> 39:59.916
As much as I wanted
to cover this up,

39:59.997 --> 40:02.826
I... I couldn't.

40:02.889 --> 40:06.021
You don't have to explain
yourself to me, Madam President.

40:06.085 --> 40:08.223
I understand completely.

40:08.289 --> 40:09.982
Henry doesn't.

40:10.048 --> 40:13.816
He'll come around.

40:13.881 --> 40:23.386
Inime.

40:23.450 --> 40:25.447
I really don't.

40:30.114 --> 40:33.085
I've lost my family.

40:35.116 --> 40:37.879
I've lost everyone.

40:40.915 --> 40:42.240
Not everyone.

40:46.107 --> 40:48.311
Then you'll take back
your letter

40:48.374 --> 40:50.339
of resignation?

40:50.403 --> 40:53.262
If you want me to.

40:53.328 --> 40:55.070
I do.

40:57.529 --> 40:59.462
I need your help, Ethan,

40:59.527 --> 41:01.459
and I need it now.

41:01.523 --> 41:05.071
The FBI has taken a man
into custody.

41:05.136 --> 41:07.963
His name is Alan Wilson.

41:36.385 --> 41:39.021
Woods is on his way
to pick up Wilson,

41:39.086 --> 41:41.018
and you need to sign
the transfer documents.

41:47.905 --> 41:50.235
What's wrong?

41:52.716 --> 41:53.881
What's going on?

41:54.872 --> 41:56.004
Get out of here, Janis.

41:56.070 --> 41:57.568
Excuse me?
- I said get out of here.

41:57.636 --> 41:59.231
What are you doing?

41:59.313 --> 42:01.038
Get out.

42:01.102 --> 42:02.669
No. Absolutely not.

42:02.734 --> 42:04.873
I'm staying right here
until Wilson is transferred.

42:04.938 --> 42:07.396
Fine.

42:07.476 --> 42:10.064
What are you...?

42:10.130 --> 42:12.206
What are you doing?
Put your hands over your head.

42:12.271 --> 42:13.711
Oh...

42:13.775 --> 42:15.675
I said do it now, Janis!

42:15.740 --> 42:18.661
Secure your hands
to that pole.

42:18.727 --> 42:20.693
Now!
- Okay, okay, okay.

42:20.772 --> 42:22.626
Just-Just calm down,
all right? Just...

42:22.705 --> 42:25.291
Renee, please
don't do this.

42:25.357 --> 42:27.990
Please don't do this.

42:28.056 --> 42:29.989
You've done your job.

42:30.072 --> 42:31.155
You arrested him.

42:31.236 --> 42:33.453
Let the courts
take it from here.

42:33.519 --> 42:35.756
Stop this now...

42:35.821 --> 42:38.327
before it's too late.

42:38.391 --> 42:39.831
Don't throw
away your career.

42:39.895 --> 42:42.564
This is absolutely insane.

42:48.551 --> 42:50.582
Larry would not
have wanted this.

42:53.280 --> 42:56.589
Don't dishonor
his death like this.

43:36.690 --> 43:38.159
Daddy.

43:40.298 --> 43:42.360
I'm too late.

43:42.424 --> 43:44.485
No, he's still
alive, Kim.

43:44.568 --> 43:46.053
We induced a
coma to help

43:46.132 --> 43:49.293
ease him through the
harsher symptoms.

43:49.358 --> 43:51.818
My name is Gohar.

43:51.883 --> 43:54.181
I'm a friend.

43:56.116 --> 43:57.122
A friend?

43:59.025 --> 44:01.180
We spent the last
few minutes talking

44:01.245 --> 44:03.785
and I can tell you he's
accepted what is happening.

44:06.757 --> 44:09.919
Maybe he has.

44:09.984 --> 44:11.852
But I haven't.

44:11.917 --> 44:13.914
The stem cell treatment
that you told me about.

44:13.978 --> 44:14.982
Can we still do it?

44:15.049 --> 44:17.573
As I told you,
it's experimental

44:17.636 --> 44:19.569
and the odds of
success are very low.

44:19.650 --> 44:21.535
Just tell me
if it's too late to try.

44:22.572 --> 44:23.579
No.

44:23.644 --> 44:24.712
Then I want to do it.

44:24.776 --> 44:25.704
The risks--

44:25.767 --> 44:27.298
I understand the risks.

44:27.363 --> 44:29.809
and I know my father didn't
want me to take that chance,

44:29.872 --> 44:31.931
but it's my choice now

44:31.996 --> 44:33.463
and I made up my mind.

44:41.840 --> 44:42.923
This is Sunny Macer.

44:43.005 --> 44:45.288
I need immediate access
to a surgical suite.

44:45.370 --> 44:46.823
Have Dr. Rosen
call me right away.

45:21.172 --> 45:23.047
I'm sorry, Daddy.

45:26.235 --> 45:29.663
But I'm not ready
to let you go.
