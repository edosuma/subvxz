I live in Webster's room.

08:24.254 --> 08:26.423
God, it's amazing.

08:26.465 --> 08:27.841
Thought I was gonna

08:26.465 --> 08:27.841
move in for two weeks

08:27.882 --> 08:29.759
I ended up

08:27.882 --> 08:29.759
staying four years.

08:29.801 --> 08:32.804
[scoffs]

08:29.801 --> 08:32.804
Well, things sure

08:29.801 --> 08:32.804
have changed, though.

08:32.846 --> 08:36.057
When you first came here, you

08:32.846 --> 08:36.057
were a wild motorcycle-riding

08:36.099 --> 08:37.851
Elvis-obsessed

08:36.099 --> 08:37.851
rock and roller.

08:37.892 --> 08:39.394
Now..

08:39.436 --> 08:41.271
Well, your hair's

08:39.436 --> 08:41.271
a little shorter in the back.

08:43.273 --> 08:45.108
Jess, uh..

08:45.150 --> 08:48.111
...in case I haven't

08:45.150 --> 08:48.111
told you enough lately

08:48.153 --> 08:50.322
thanks a lot for helping me

08:48.153 --> 08:50.322
all this time.

08:52.573 --> 08:53.700
Ah, what the heck.

08:53.741 --> 08:56.161
Just-just this one time.

08:57.204 --> 08:58.830
[both chuckle]

08:58.872 --> 09:00.707
(in unison)

08:58.872 --> 09:00.707
Aww.

09:00.748 --> 09:02.876
And I get caught.

09:02.917 --> 09:05.170
(in unison)

09:02.917 --> 09:05.170
Aww.

09:05.212 --> 09:06.338
[chuckles]

09:08.589 --> 09:10.800
I'm all packed.

09:08.589 --> 09:10.800
Let's go, people.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.388
Michelle.

09:14.429 --> 09:17.057
Didn't you hear we're moving

09:14.429 --> 09:17.057
to Aunt Becky's?

09:18.183 --> 09:19.767
Sweetie, uh..

09:19.809 --> 09:22.354
...I think, you got things

09:19.809 --> 09:22.354
a little mixed up.

09:22.396 --> 09:23.688
You're not

09:22.396 --> 09:23.688
goin' anywhere.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.982
Uncle Jesse

09:23.730 --> 09:25.982
is the one who's leavin'.

09:26.024 --> 09:28.860
But we're supposed

09:26.024 --> 09:28.860
to be a big, happy family.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.367
The kid's really having

09:33.240 --> 09:35.367
trouble with this.

09:35.409 --> 09:38.370
Yeah. I'll go try to explain

09:35.409 --> 09:38.370
to her why I'm leaving.

09:47.670 --> 09:51.174
Michelle, I think it's time for

09:47.670 --> 09:51.174
one of our world famous talks.

09:51.216 --> 09:52.592
Man to munchkin.

09:52.633 --> 09:54.802
Why are you leaving me?

09:56.137 --> 09:58.390
Darling,

09:56.137 --> 09:58.390
I'm not leaving you.

09:58.432 --> 09:59.766
It's just that

09:58.432 --> 09:59.766
I'm married now

09:59.807 --> 10:01.101
and I have

09:59.807 --> 10:01.101
to live with my wife.

10:01.142 --> 10:02.852
It's kind of a tradition.

10:04.563 --> 10:06.689
Listen, I-I-I'll be over here

10:04.563 --> 10:06.689
all the time, I promise.

10:06.731 --> 10:08.149
And I'm gonna

10:06.731 --> 10:08.149
be working with Joey.

10:08.191 --> 10:10.651
And I'm just a

10:08.191 --> 10:10.651
ten minute walk from here.

10:10.693 --> 10:12.028
Two minutes by car.

10:12.070 --> 10:14.655
Three seconds by jet.

10:14.697 --> 10:18.285
Are you still going

10:14.697 --> 10:18.285
to sing me the teddy bear song?

10:18.326 --> 10:21.829
No, not every night,

10:18.326 --> 10:21.829
but-but your daddy and Joey

10:21.871 --> 10:23.248
they-they'll sing

10:21.871 --> 10:23.248
the song for you.

10:23.290 --> 10:24.999
They sing..

10:25.041 --> 10:27.085
I'll tape it for you.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.920
I'm going to miss you.

10:31.839 --> 10:33.716
Oh.

10:33.758 --> 10:36.803
I'm gonna miss you, too, pal.

10:36.844 --> 10:38.221
But we..

10:38.263 --> 10:40.056
We have to put on

10:38.263 --> 10:40.056
our bravest face now, okay?

10:40.098 --> 10:41.849
We've got to be really brave

10:40.098 --> 10:41.849
about this thing, alright?

10:41.891 --> 10:44.144
So, let-let me see your brave

10:41.891 --> 10:44.144
face. Can you smile for me?

10:45.520 --> 10:47.105
Attagirl.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.773
Alright, now that we've got

10:47.147 --> 10:48.773
this bravery thing happening

10:48.815 --> 10:51.568
I want you to give me

10:48.815 --> 10:51.568
the biggest, most gigantic

10:51.610 --> 10:53.778
most greatest hug you ever gave

10:51.610 --> 10:53.778
me in the whole entire world.

10:53.820 --> 10:56.072
Ready? And go!

10:53.820 --> 10:56.072
Hug, hug, hug, hug!

10:56.114 --> 10:57.657
[kissing]

10:59.159 --> 11:01.077
Alright, attagirl!

11:02.745 --> 11:04.914
This is a goodbye present.

11:06.416 --> 11:09.336
Michelle, it's your pig.

11:06.416 --> 11:09.336
Are you sure?

11:09.377 --> 11:11.171
Yes, I'm sure.

11:12.922 --> 11:14.257
Oh, in that case, here.

11:14.299 --> 11:16.301
I want you to have this.

11:14.299 --> 11:16.301
This is my pink bunny.

11:16.343 --> 11:18.136
I want you to put

11:16.343 --> 11:18.136
it up on the wall.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.847
and whenever you look at it,

11:18.178 --> 11:20.847
you can think of me, okay?

11:20.888 --> 11:22.349
You got it, dude.

11:36.904 --> 11:41.242
- Goodbye, Michelle.

11:36.904 --> 11:41.242
- Goodbye, Uncle Jesse.

11:41.284 --> 11:43.953
[instrumental music]

12:07.143 --> 12:08.228
[instrumental music]

12:12.482 --> 12:15.402
Alright. That's it.

12:12.482 --> 12:15.402
That's the last load.

12:15.443 --> 12:18.613
I'm not carrying one more

12:15.443 --> 12:18.613
thing in this house.

12:18.655 --> 12:19.947
Jess?

12:19.989 --> 12:21.658
Aren't you

12:19.989 --> 12:21.658
forgetting something?

12:22.783 --> 12:23.951
Bride.

12:23.993 --> 12:25.579
Threshold.

12:25.620 --> 12:26.996
Alright. Hop on.

12:27.914 --> 12:29.457
- Jess!

12:27.914 --> 12:29.457
- I'm kidding.

12:29.499 --> 12:31.459
I'm kidding.

12:29.499 --> 12:31.459
A little newly wed humor.

12:31.501 --> 12:33.628
- Alright. And she's up.

12:31.501 --> 12:33.628
- Ow.

12:33.670 --> 12:35.255
She's over. They kiss.

12:37.549 --> 12:38.592
[screaming]

12:38.633 --> 12:41.094
And she's down!

12:41.135 --> 12:42.803
Well..

12:42.845 --> 12:45.265
Boy, this is it.

12:45.306 --> 12:48.518
Our new life in our new home

12:45.306 --> 12:48.518
has officially started.

12:48.560 --> 12:52.855
Yeah. Let's talk about this

12:48.560 --> 12:52.855
new home of ours, shall we?

12:52.897 --> 12:54.274
Let's regroup here

12:52.897 --> 12:54.274
and take a look.

12:54.315 --> 12:56.443
Now, uh...no offense

12:56.484 --> 12:58.528
but, uh,

12:56.484 --> 12:58.528
I think the motif here

12:58.570 --> 13:00.779
is a little on the

12:58.570 --> 13:00.779
girlie side, if you will.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.826
Well, I am a girl.

13:05.868 --> 13:09.163
Yes and that's one of the

13:05.868 --> 13:09.163
main reasons I married you.

13:09.205 --> 13:10.457
Point is

13:09.205 --> 13:10.457
a man lives here now.

13:10.498 --> 13:11.999
We've gotta

13:10.498 --> 13:11.999
make it more manly

13:12.041 --> 13:14.210
you know, like some

13:12.041 --> 13:14.210
manly naugahyde over this

13:14.252 --> 13:15.420
which will go quite nicely

13:15.462 --> 13:17.464
with my hubcap

13:15.462 --> 13:17.464
end tables right here.

13:18.632 --> 13:21.842
Sweetheart, come sit down.

13:21.884 --> 13:23.637
Now, before

13:21.884 --> 13:23.637
we start redecorating

13:23.678 --> 13:26.013
or putting your

13:23.678 --> 13:26.013
stuff back into storage

13:26.055 --> 13:28.433
why don't we just

13:26.055 --> 13:28.433
sit back and relax

13:28.475 --> 13:30.893
and pretend like

13:28.475 --> 13:30.893
we're already unpacked?

13:30.935 --> 13:32.061
Loving it.

13:32.103 --> 13:34.606
Loving..

13:34.648 --> 13:36.232
Oh.

13:36.274 --> 13:37.567
Michelle's pig.

13:39.944 --> 13:41.820
You know what I'd be doing

13:39.944 --> 13:41.820
right now if I was home?

13:43.072 --> 13:45.074
Honey, you<i> are</i> home.

13:45.116 --> 13:46.618
I-I meant my old home.

13:48.453 --> 13:50.913
Me and the guys would be singing

13:48.453 --> 13:50.913
Michelle to sleep right now.

13:54.041 --> 13:56.670
♪ Baby let me be ♪

13:56.711 --> 13:59.130
♪ Your loving teddy bear ♪

14:17.064 --> 14:18.983
That was a very good try.

14:20.610 --> 14:23.697
I know, Michelle, we're missing

14:20.610 --> 14:23.697
a third of our trio.

14:23.738 --> 14:25.657
I miss Uncle Jesse.

14:26.991 --> 14:28.868
Oh, I know, sweetie.

14:28.909 --> 14:31.037
We all miss Uncle Jesse.

14:31.078 --> 14:32.330
It's just gonna

14:31.078 --> 14:32.330
take a little time

14:32.372 --> 14:34.541
to get used to him

14:32.372 --> 14:34.541
not living here.

14:34.582 --> 14:36.835
But you're gonna see him

14:34.582 --> 14:36.835
first thing in the morning.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.336
So, the sooner

14:36.876 --> 14:38.336
you fall asleep

14:38.378 --> 14:40.505
sooner Uncle Jesse

14:38.378 --> 14:40.505
will be here.

14:40.547 --> 14:44.258
Really?

14:40.547 --> 14:44.258
I'm getting<i> very</i> sleepy.

14:45.426 --> 14:46.761
Goodnight, honey.

14:49.681 --> 14:53.476
Goodnight, Joey.

14:49.681 --> 14:53.476
Goodnight, daddy. I love you.

14:53.518 --> 14:54.728
I love you, too.

15:00.775 --> 15:02.569
Goodnight, Uncle Jesse.

15:06.989 --> 15:09.242
Kimmy, do you know

15:06.989 --> 15:09.242
where I am right now?

15:09.283 --> 15:10.493
On my side of the room.

15:11.994 --> 15:13.830
And guess

15:11.994 --> 15:13.830
where I am right now?

15:13.872 --> 15:15.915
I'm still on

15:13.872 --> 15:15.915
my side of the room.

15:15.956 --> 15:17.917
It's mine. All mine!

15:18.543 --> 15:19.711
Howdy, neighbor?

15:19.753 --> 15:21.462
Miss me?

15:21.504 --> 15:22.589
Uh-oh. I'll call you back.

15:22.630 --> 15:23.798
I have a visitor.

15:25.258 --> 15:26.593
May I help you?

15:26.634 --> 15:29.554
It's lonely sleeping

15:26.634 --> 15:29.554
in Uncle Jesse's room.

15:29.596 --> 15:32.473
I know. I miss him, too.

15:29.596 --> 15:32.473
Well, goodnight.

15:32.515 --> 15:34.058
Tell me..

15:34.100 --> 15:36.477
...why are we so happy

15:34.100 --> 15:36.477
we have our own rooms?

15:36.519 --> 15:38.438
Because sleeping

15:36.519 --> 15:38.438
in separate rooms

15:38.479 --> 15:40.189
will bring us

15:38.479 --> 15:40.189
closer together.

15:40.231 --> 15:42.692
- It will?

15:40.231 --> 15:42.692
- Well, sure.

15:42.734 --> 15:44.235
See, we're together

15:42.734 --> 15:44.235
all the time

15:44.277 --> 15:46.946
so we never have a chance

15:44.277 --> 15:46.946
to miss each other.

15:46.987 --> 15:48.406
But now that we're apart

15:48.448 --> 15:50.199
we can miss

15:48.448 --> 15:50.199
each other like crazy.

15:50.241 --> 15:52.159
And it'll

15:50.241 --> 15:52.159
bring us closer together.

15:52.201 --> 15:55.288
- Get it?

15:52.201 --> 15:55.288
- I think so.

15:55.329 --> 15:56.790
For us to get closer

15:56.831 --> 15:58.875
I've got to

15:56.831 --> 15:58.875
stay away from you?

15:58.917 --> 16:00.000
Exactly.

16:00.042 --> 16:01.335
Now try it.

16:02.336 --> 16:03.630
I'm missing you already.

16:03.671 --> 16:04.839
Really?

16:04.881 --> 16:07.007
Oh, yeah.

16:04.881 --> 16:07.007
I'm missing you even more.

16:07.049 --> 16:08.802
I guess it's working.

16:08.843 --> 16:10.762
We have never been closer.

16:11.721 --> 16:12.889
Yes.

16:14.056 --> 16:16.476
Okay, everybody,

16:14.056 --> 16:16.476
who wants more pancakes?

16:16.517 --> 16:17.769
- Me!

16:16.517 --> 16:17.769
- I do!

16:17.811 --> 16:18.937
Here you go.

16:20.187 --> 16:22.022
Thank you very much.

16:27.946 --> 16:29.238
You better make more.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.532
These people look hungry.

16:33.075 --> 16:34.368
Hey!

16:34.410 --> 16:35.787
Uncle Jesse!

16:35.829 --> 16:39.582
My family! Hello!

16:39.624 --> 16:41.292
Oh, I've missed you all so much.

16:42.418 --> 16:43.753
You guys missed

16:42.418 --> 16:43.753
the cutest thing.

16:43.795 --> 16:45.379
Danny says,

16:43.795 --> 16:45.379
"Who wants more pancakes?"

16:45.421 --> 16:47.214
Michelle took

16:45.421 --> 16:47.214
the whole stack and said

16:47.256 --> 16:50.384
[squeaking]

16:47.256 --> 16:50.384
"You better make more,

16:47.256 --> 16:50.384
these people are hungry."

16:51.385 --> 16:55.055
It was funny,

16:51.385 --> 16:55.055
Uncle Jesse.

16:55.097 --> 16:57.725
Oh, I missed it?

16:55.097 --> 16:57.725
Danny, tape these things.

16:57.767 --> 16:59.143
Oh, no problem,

16:57.767 --> 16:59.143
I'll just quit my job

16:59.185 --> 17:00.812
and videotape their

16:59.185 --> 17:00.812
every waking moment.

17:00.854 --> 17:02.271
Good. Aw.

17:03.815 --> 17:04.899
Isn't this great?

17:04.941 --> 17:06.818
The whole family's

17:04.941 --> 17:06.818
back together.

17:06.860 --> 17:10.154
That's right.

17:06.860 --> 17:10.154
One whole family.

17:10.196 --> 17:12.740
What a perfect time

17:10.196 --> 17:12.740
for a fractions lesson.

17:12.782 --> 17:16.744
No! Please don't turn

17:12.782 --> 17:16.744
my pancake into homework.

17:16.786 --> 17:18.579
Steph, just relax.

17:16.786 --> 17:18.579
This time I'm using people.

17:18.621 --> 17:20.957
Everybody, stand up.

17:20.999 --> 17:23.543
Alright, now listen,

17:20.999 --> 17:23.543
we have seven people here.

17:23.584 --> 17:25.169
And seven sevens

17:23.584 --> 17:25.169
make a whole

17:25.211 --> 17:27.797
so each person

17:25.211 --> 17:27.797
is one seventh.

17:27.839 --> 17:31.384
But Uncle Jesse

17:27.839 --> 17:31.384
and Aunt Becky..

17:31.425 --> 17:33.219
...they don't live

17:31.425 --> 17:33.219
here anymore.

17:33.260 --> 17:34.679
Yeah, but I'm still part

17:33.260 --> 17:34.679
of the family, right?

17:34.721 --> 17:37.181
Yes you are, but right now

17:34.721 --> 17:37.181
you're a visual aid.

17:37.223 --> 17:38.975
So..

17:39.017 --> 17:41.060
...two sevens..

17:41.101 --> 17:43.103
...from seven sevens..

17:43.145 --> 17:44.939
...is how many?

17:44.981 --> 17:46.106
One..

17:46.148 --> 17:47.483
...two..

17:47.525 --> 17:50.486
...three, four, five.

17:50.528 --> 17:51.946
Five sevens.

17:51.988 --> 17:54.657
And five sevenths

17:51.988 --> 17:54.657
plus two sevenths

17:54.699 --> 17:57.076
equals seven sevenths,

17:54.699 --> 17:57.076
one whole family!

17:57.117 --> 17:59.078
[chuckles]

17:57.117 --> 17:59.078
Steph, you just added fractions.

17:59.119 --> 18:00.955
- I did?

17:59.119 --> 18:00.955
- Sure did.

18:00.997 --> 18:04.166
I did, I did, I did!

18:00.997 --> 18:04.166
Thanks, everybody.

18:04.208 --> 18:06.920
I've got to get to school

18:04.208 --> 18:06.920
while I'm still hot.

18:06.961 --> 18:09.630
[laughing]

18:09.672 --> 18:10.840
You know something?

18:10.882 --> 18:12.091
Now that she's

18:10.882 --> 18:12.091
out of my room

18:12.132 --> 18:13.342
I think she's adorable.

18:14.677 --> 18:16.554
Come on, Becky.

18:14.677 --> 18:16.554
We better get to the studio.

18:18.431 --> 18:21.141
Alright, Michelle, I'm gonna

18:18.431 --> 18:21.141
drive you to preschool, honey.

18:21.183 --> 18:25.563
Uncle Jesse, could you sing me

18:21.183 --> 18:25.563
the teddy bear song tonight?

18:25.605 --> 18:28.524
Sure, um...

18:25.605 --> 18:28.524
would it be okay, honey?

18:28.566 --> 18:29.776
We'll just have dinner

18:28.566 --> 18:29.776
here and then

18:29.817 --> 18:31.694
I can put her

18:29.817 --> 18:31.694
to bed after that.

18:31.736 --> 18:34.363
You know what, Jess,

18:31.736 --> 18:34.363
that reminds me.

18:34.405 --> 18:35.990
We can't sleep

18:34.405 --> 18:35.990
at home tonight.

18:36.032 --> 18:37.742
You know,

18:36.032 --> 18:37.742
I-I completely forgot.

18:37.784 --> 18:40.912
The exterminator is-is coming

18:37.784 --> 18:40.912
over to spray for termites.

18:40.954 --> 18:43.081
I-I set it up weeks ago.

18:43.122 --> 18:46.042
Danny, i-is it okay if we sleep

18:43.122 --> 18:46.042
in the attic tonight?

18:46.084 --> 18:48.127
- Sure. No problem.

18:46.084 --> 18:48.127
- Alright!

18:48.168 --> 18:51.380
We're spending the night!

18:48.168 --> 18:51.380
Did you hear that, buddy?

18:51.422 --> 18:55.676
- We could have a pajama party.

18:51.422 --> 18:55.676
- Great.

18:55.718 --> 18:58.345
Should I wear my ninjas

18:55.718 --> 18:58.345
or my California Raisins?

18:59.680 --> 19:01.641
[upbeat music]

19:05.686 --> 19:07.354
Twin cots.

19:07.396 --> 19:10.691
Gee, I hope Wally and the Beav

19:07.396 --> 19:10.691
don't come up and disturb us.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.445
- Ward?

19:12.485 --> 19:14.445
- Yes, June.

19:16.530 --> 19:18.908
I have a confession.

19:18.950 --> 19:21.035
We don't have termites.

19:21.077 --> 19:24.622
Don't tell me it's silverfish.

19:21.077 --> 19:24.622
I hate silverfish.

19:24.664 --> 19:27.333
No, sweetheart, there aren't

19:24.664 --> 19:27.333
any insects in our apartment.

19:28.626 --> 19:31.295
I made it up because I..

19:31.337 --> 19:34.007
...I just thought you could use

19:31.337 --> 19:34.007
a little family reunion.

19:35.299 --> 19:37.384
Was I that obvious?

19:37.426 --> 19:39.386
Jess, you slept

19:37.426 --> 19:39.386
with Michelle's pig.

19:42.056 --> 19:45.184
Aw, this is

19:42.056 --> 19:45.184
very sweet of you.

19:45.225 --> 19:46.560
Now, come on, let's go home,

19:45.225 --> 19:46.560
we don't wanna sleep

19:46.602 --> 19:47.728
in this attic, do we?

19:47.770 --> 19:50.064
Well, it's...kind of nice.

19:50.106 --> 19:51.565
Like our own apartment,

19:50.106 --> 19:51.565
you know.

19:51.607 --> 19:52.900
It's cozy and private.

19:52.942 --> 19:54.986
1,300 square feet,

19:52.942 --> 19:54.986
fully insulated

19:55.028 --> 19:58.197
with complete plumbing hookups

19:55.028 --> 19:58.197
for a full bathroom.

19:58.238 --> 19:59.824
Ideal for a young,

19:58.238 --> 19:59.824
newly wed couple

19:59.866 --> 20:01.659
saving to buy

19:59.866 --> 20:01.659
their first home.

20:02.827 --> 20:04.620
What are you getting at?

20:04.662 --> 20:07.957
Well...I talked to Danny

20:04.662 --> 20:07.957
about us living up here

20:07.999 --> 20:10.292
and he thinks

20:07.999 --> 20:10.292
it's a great idea, and so do I.

20:11.418 --> 20:13.420
Ah, Beck..

20:11.418 --> 20:13.420
Oh, this is nuts.

20:15.506 --> 20:17.175
Honey, we're-we're

20:15.506 --> 20:17.175
a married couple.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.886
We're man and wife. We should

20:17.216 --> 20:19.886
have a place of our own.

20:19.927 --> 20:21.595
We could make

20:19.927 --> 20:21.595
this place our own.

20:22.763 --> 20:24.765
Well, look..

20:24.807 --> 20:26.517
...I could never ask you

20:24.807 --> 20:26.517
to make that kind of sacrifice

20:26.559 --> 20:28.186
just because

20:26.559 --> 20:28.186
I miss my family.

20:28.227 --> 20:31.522
Yeah, but they're

20:28.227 --> 20:31.522
my family, too and I love them.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.816
And I love you.

20:33.858 --> 20:37.904
Now, admit it.

20:33.858 --> 20:37.904
You like this idea, don't you?

20:37.945 --> 20:39.405
Well, there's-there's

20:37.945 --> 20:39.405
nothing in the world

20:39.446 --> 20:41.115
that would make me happier

20:39.446 --> 20:41.115
than moving back

20:41.157 --> 20:42.658
in with my family, but..

20:44.618 --> 20:46.370
...are you sure about this?

20:46.412 --> 20:47.580
I insist.

20:49.665 --> 20:51.042
Okay.

20:51.084 --> 20:54.003
As a favor to you,

20:51.084 --> 20:54.003
we'll move back in.

20:54.045 --> 20:55.295
[chuckles]

20:55.337 --> 20:58.257
Hey, everybody, get up here!

20:58.298 --> 20:59.550
He went for it!

20:59.592 --> 21:03.137
- Alright!

20:59.592 --> 21:03.137
- Yay!

21:04.222 --> 21:06.348
Start the pajama party!

21:06.390 --> 21:08.184
[laughs]

21:08.226 --> 21:09.977
Aw, you guys are the best.

21:10.019 --> 21:11.270
Thank you, Danny.

21:11.311 --> 21:13.606
Aw, Jess, it's great

21:11.311 --> 21:13.606
to have you back.

21:13.647 --> 21:15.441
Wait a minute.

21:13.647 --> 21:15.441
Joey, our equipment's up here.

21:15.482 --> 21:17.484
- Where are we gonna work?

21:15.482 --> 21:17.484
- Well, simple, Jess.

21:17.526 --> 21:19.445
You guys move into attic.

21:17.526 --> 21:19.445
I move into your room.

21:19.486 --> 21:23.574
The studio moves into my room,

21:19.486 --> 21:23.574
and Steph moves back in with..

21:23.616 --> 21:25.743
Honey, I'm home!

21:28.662 --> 21:29.914
Well, I guess it's worth it

21:29.956 --> 21:33.000
to have Uncle Jesse

21:29.956 --> 21:33.000
and Aunt Becky here.

21:33.042 --> 21:34.585
I know, they say

21:33.042 --> 21:34.585
you can't have it all

21:34.627 --> 21:36.212
but I feel like I do.

21:36.254 --> 21:39.257
I get the most

21:36.254 --> 21:39.257
beautiful wife in the world..

21:39.298 --> 21:41.842
...the greatest family.

21:41.884 --> 21:44.553
Really cool hair..

21:44.595 --> 21:46.013
...great bike, a shiny bike.

21:46.055 --> 21:47.681
Jess, we-we get the picture.

21:47.723 --> 21:50.977
Speaking of which, Michelle,

21:47.723 --> 21:50.977
would you like to do the honors?

21:51.018 --> 21:52.812
It'll be my pleasure.

21:56.816 --> 21:59.819
Uncle Jesse, welcome home.
