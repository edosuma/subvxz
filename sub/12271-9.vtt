00:13.187 --> 00:15.856
Happiness is a fallacy.

00:15.924 --> 00:17.762
WILFRED:
If I just agree with you,

00:17.830 --> 00:19.236
can we talk about
something else?

00:19.304 --> 00:21.442
Anything else?

00:21.510 --> 00:24.814
I mean, there are things

00:24.882 --> 00:29.723
that make you happy, but it's
not a sustainable feeling.

00:29.791 --> 00:32.328
Parades don't last forever.

00:32.396 --> 00:35.660
Fireworks burn out, colors fade.

00:35.728 --> 00:37.697
It's not about
parades and fireworks.

00:37.765 --> 00:39.134
It's about

00:39.202 --> 00:40.269
that pair of tits there.

00:40.337 --> 00:41.972
That's happiness.

00:42.041 --> 00:45.458
A scratch behind the ear,
the sun on your face...

00:45.578 --> 00:47.903
a decaying seagull carcass.

00:48.128 --> 00:50.618
Happiness is in the
quieter moments, mate.

00:50.686 --> 00:52.222
(rumbling begins, gets louder)

00:52.290 --> 00:54.325
It's the small things that...

00:54.392 --> 00:56.660
(vehicle's engine rumbling)

00:56.728 --> 01:00.367
(vehicle engine revving)

01:00.434 --> 01:02.771
(vehicle driving away,
rumble fading)

01:10.997 --> 01:13.753
The vet said he might start
vomiting, have a seizure

01:13.821 --> 01:15.255
or just stop eating.
What's that sound?

01:15.323 --> 01:17.359
Well, there are things
that we can do.

01:17.427 --> 01:19.964
I saw a Web site
about these new steroids that...

01:20.031 --> 01:22.064
I don't want to put
him through that.

01:22.132 --> 01:24.293
WILFRED: Anyway, guys, uh,
it's good chatting with you.

01:24.335 --> 01:25.937
JENNA:
We just need to make sure

01:26.004 --> 01:28.208
that he doesn't
overexert himself and...

01:28.276 --> 01:30.578
wait.

01:33.485 --> 01:35.787
(crying)

01:42.533 --> 01:45.564
Thank you.

01:45.631 --> 01:48.067
Any time.

01:48.134 --> 01:50.234
No, I-I mean for...

01:50.302 --> 01:53.306
you know, just letting me cry
and not trying to fix me.

01:53.374 --> 01:55.674
Drew used to always
try to cheer me up

01:55.742 --> 01:57.109
by playing
"Got your nose!"

01:57.176 --> 01:58.478
(laughs)

01:58.545 --> 02:00.981
It was so annoying.

02:01.049 --> 02:03.316
His heart was
in the right place.

02:05.855 --> 02:09.293
God, we were so young
when we started dating.

02:09.360 --> 02:11.961
It felt safe and
comfortable, but...

02:12.029 --> 02:15.064
I could never be
myself around Drew.

02:15.133 --> 02:17.268
It was like I was
wearing this mask

02:17.336 --> 02:19.537
that I couldn't take off.

02:22.109 --> 02:25.381
But I know that you love
the real me, warts and all.

02:25.448 --> 02:26.949
(laughs)

02:27.016 --> 02:29.285
Wait. You have warts?

02:29.352 --> 02:31.654
(both laugh)

02:33.000 --> 02:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here

02:40.402 --> 02:42.804
Where is this place?

02:42.872 --> 02:44.673
I don't know.

02:44.741 --> 02:47.842
Huh. Wonder why I never
noticed it before.

02:47.910 --> 02:50.948
Looks like a good place
to curb stomp ducks.

02:55.356 --> 02:57.356
(sighs)

02:57.424 --> 02:58.993
Wilfred, are you insane?

02:59.060 --> 03:01.861
That's ironic,
you asking me that. Good one.

03:01.929 --> 03:05.033
You can't smoke anymore.
Why?

03:05.102 --> 03:06.403
Because I got lung cancer?

03:06.470 --> 03:08.072
Well, that's just stupid.

03:08.140 --> 03:09.940
That's like the guy

03:10.008 --> 03:11.809
who starts wearing condoms
after he gets AIDS.

03:14.613 --> 03:15.748
What the hell is that?

03:15.816 --> 03:17.784
Raw food: Chicken,

03:17.852 --> 03:20.052
liver, rice, seaweed,
carrots and eggs.

03:20.119 --> 03:23.057
This food can help
you get better.

03:23.125 --> 03:25.792
Ryan, I've eaten
all kinds of shit--

03:25.860 --> 03:28.162
rabbit shit, cat shit,
deer shit--

03:28.230 --> 03:29.598
I'm not a fussy eater.

03:29.666 --> 03:31.636
But I draw the line at carrots.

03:31.703 --> 03:32.870
Fine, then have some kibble.

03:32.938 --> 03:34.238
Boring.

03:34.306 --> 03:35.539
I'll order you a pizza.

03:35.607 --> 03:37.175
I'm not hungry.

03:37.243 --> 03:39.378
Wilfred, you have to eat
something, or you'll...

03:39.446 --> 03:42.782
Finish the sentence, Ry.

03:44.152 --> 03:46.454
I'm not giving up.

03:46.522 --> 03:51.359
Mate, you gotta stop looking
at this as a bad thing.

03:51.427 --> 03:54.798
I have completed
my godly mission of leading you

03:54.866 --> 03:56.267
to happiness.
I can't.

03:56.334 --> 03:57.868
That-That's just not...
It's true.

03:57.936 --> 04:00.137
When I met you, you were trying
to off yourself

04:00.205 --> 04:01.572
with a bottle of pills.

04:01.640 --> 04:02.941
Now, you're parting
the pink seas

04:03.009 --> 04:04.443
with the girl of your dreams.

04:04.511 --> 04:06.278
(sighs)

04:06.346 --> 04:10.049
It's time for me to move on
to the next pathetic loser.

04:10.117 --> 04:13.253
I-I mean, "chosen one."

04:13.321 --> 04:15.055
It's just...

04:15.122 --> 04:17.055
so sad.

04:17.122 --> 04:20.623
Ryan, consider this.

04:20.690 --> 04:23.059
If I...

04:25.061 --> 04:26.128
Wilfred...
(groans)

04:26.196 --> 04:28.734
(coughing)
Wilfred!

04:28.801 --> 04:31.036
(groaning) Wilfred?
Oh, my God. No!

04:31.104 --> 04:32.839
Wilfred!

04:32.906 --> 04:34.677
Gotcha.

04:34.745 --> 04:37.048
Oh, you asshole.
(giggling)

04:37.116 --> 04:39.383
I was just only trying
to make you laugh.

04:39.451 --> 04:41.451
Well, it didn't make me laugh.
Made me laugh.

04:41.519 --> 04:44.356
Jesus.

04:44.423 --> 04:45.959
I knew you two
would get together.

04:46.026 --> 04:47.428
(Jenna laughs)

04:47.496 --> 04:49.698
Well, Ryan figured
it out before I did.

04:49.766 --> 04:52.034
Well, Ryan was always
a very special little boy.

04:52.101 --> 04:54.669
Even as a baby,
he knew exactly what he wanted.

04:54.736 --> 04:56.336
(Catherine laughs)

04:56.404 --> 04:57.705
Always the left breast,

04:57.772 --> 04:59.139
never the right,

04:59.207 --> 05:01.040
and I bet he hasn't
changed a bit, has he?

05:01.107 --> 05:03.074
(snickering)

05:03.143 --> 05:06.647
You know, I've never seen
any baby pictures of Ryan.

05:06.715 --> 05:08.247
Yeah, they're here somewhere.

05:08.314 --> 05:09.948
I-I haven't finished unpacking
from my move,

05:10.015 --> 05:11.981
but I'll dig them out this week.

05:15.988 --> 05:18.153
Well, Ralston pooped
three times.

05:18.221 --> 05:21.092
Of course, I only had two bags,
so I had to improvise.

05:21.160 --> 05:23.260
Ryan, how you doing?

05:23.328 --> 05:24.762
Come here.

05:24.829 --> 05:26.830
(Cahill laughs)

05:26.898 --> 05:28.768
(Ryan chuckles, Cahill laughs)

05:28.836 --> 05:30.170
Jenna.
How do you do?

05:30.238 --> 05:31.737
Nice to meet you.

05:31.805 --> 05:34.339
Oh, looks like I got here
just in time.

05:34.407 --> 05:37.076
Your hug vitals are low.

05:37.144 --> 05:40.280
- Oh. - When was the last time 
you had your neck examined? Mmm.

05:40.348 --> 05:42.417
CAHILL: Mm-mm! (laughs)
(Catherine giggles)

05:42.485 --> 05:44.387
Don't worry.

05:44.455 --> 05:46.388
I'm a doctor.

05:46.456 --> 05:47.853
WILFRED:
Hey, dickweed,

05:47.973 --> 05:48.788
check it out.

05:48.908 --> 05:51.639
You're not the only tripod
on the block anymore.

05:52.113 --> 05:54.408
Wilfred, how you doing,
little fella?

05:54.528 --> 05:57.102
Oh, Elliott, Wilfred has cancer.

05:57.222 --> 05:58.187
WILFRED:
You hear that, bitch?

05:58.307 --> 06:01.194
The big C.
Fourth-stage lung cancer.

06:01.314 --> 06:03.681
(imitates gunshot)
I win.

06:03.749 --> 06:05.610
(Wilfred cackles)
CAHILL: I am so sorry.

06:05.730 --> 06:06.608
But don't lose hope.

06:06.743 --> 06:08.577
Listen, this little fella
had cancer three times.

06:08.645 --> 06:09.612
Seriously?
Seriously?

06:09.680 --> 06:11.416
He's a real miracle.

06:11.484 --> 06:13.387
I brought him to a holistic vet.

06:13.454 --> 06:15.756
He used herbs,
acupuncture, Reiki...

06:15.824 --> 06:17.459
We haven't tried
Eastern medicine.

06:17.526 --> 06:19.260
The vet said
Wilfred's too far along.

06:19.327 --> 06:21.495
Well, it wouldn't
hurt to get a name.

06:21.562 --> 06:23.596
Oh, we can talk
about this later.

06:23.664 --> 06:26.131
CAHILL: Listen, as a practitioner
of Western medicine,

06:26.199 --> 06:27.864
I was skeptical,
but I'm telling you,

06:27.932 --> 06:30.901
this naturopathic "doctor"
saved his life.

06:30.969 --> 06:33.569
Isn't that right,
my little survivor?

06:33.637 --> 06:36.705
Yeah, well, you may have had
more cancer than me,

06:36.772 --> 06:38.773
but I'm the only
one who has it now!

06:38.840 --> 06:40.107
CAHILL:
Oh, shit!

06:41.575 --> 06:42.608
Is that a lump?

06:42.676 --> 06:44.644
Bloody hell!

06:44.712 --> 06:46.647
But Dr. Ha could
save his life.

06:46.715 --> 06:48.549
I don't understand why
you're so against this.

06:48.616 --> 06:50.715
Because I can't
handle hope right now!

06:50.783 --> 06:52.182
He's dying, Ryan!

06:52.250 --> 06:53.618
(Jenna sighs)

06:53.685 --> 06:55.287
What are you doing, mate?

06:55.355 --> 06:56.721
I'm trying to save your life.

06:56.788 --> 06:58.654
No, what you're doing is
creating a rift

06:58.722 --> 07:00.590
between you and Jenna,
and if that happens,

07:00.658 --> 07:01.992
my death will be meaningless.

07:02.060 --> 07:03.761
This is how it's supposed to be.

07:03.829 --> 07:06.561
I'm gonna die, you and Jenna
are gonna be together forever,

07:06.628 --> 07:08.283
and nothing's gonna change that!

07:08.403 --> 07:09.576
DREW:
Hey, bro.

07:17.137 --> 07:18.603
Hey, Wilfy!
How's my boy, huh?

07:18.671 --> 07:20.104
He has cancer.

07:20.172 --> 07:22.311
And now he's got
a 200-pound tumor.

07:24.880 --> 07:26.648
My mom told him about Wilfred.

07:26.716 --> 07:28.351
He called me to get the details,

07:28.419 --> 07:30.487
but he didn't say anything
about coming out here.

07:30.555 --> 07:31.857
Did you tell him about us?

07:31.924 --> 07:33.592
I meant to,

07:33.660 --> 07:35.793
but his call was
so unexpected and...

07:35.861 --> 07:37.529
I was so upset.

07:37.597 --> 07:39.398
Whatever you want to do.

07:39.466 --> 07:41.668
It's okay. Let's just
keep this about Wilfred.

07:44.035 --> 07:46.137
Drew, take it easy with Wilfred.

07:46.206 --> 07:47.708
He's not supposed
to exert himself.

07:47.776 --> 07:50.208
Yeah, okay.

07:50.275 --> 07:52.276
I don't think he's
too happy to see me.

07:52.343 --> 07:54.111
Of course he is.
We all are.

07:54.180 --> 07:55.682
WILFRED:
Get rid of him, Ryan.

07:55.749 --> 07:58.017
Throw his magnificent,
rock-hard ass out of here.

07:58.084 --> 07:59.251
Hey, check it out!

07:59.319 --> 08:01.589
It's Sporty!
Sporty?

08:01.657 --> 08:04.528
Yeah, that's the squirrel that
used to throw nuts at my rig

08:04.595 --> 08:07.495
every time I parked under
the walnut tree out front.

08:07.563 --> 08:09.365
At least he looks
happy to see me.

08:09.433 --> 08:10.701
You really
should have called, Drew.

08:10.768 --> 08:12.305
I mean,
where are you gonna stay?

08:12.372 --> 08:14.740
I don't know.
I thought maybe with you?

08:14.808 --> 08:16.540
Uh, I... I don't, uh...

08:16.608 --> 08:18.376
Sorry. That's stupid.

08:18.444 --> 08:20.078
Never mind.

08:20.146 --> 08:22.048
I'll figure it out.

08:23.450 --> 08:25.451
You can crash on my couch.

08:25.519 --> 08:26.786
Ryan, no!

08:26.853 --> 08:29.989
The past is the past, right?

08:30.056 --> 08:31.523
(Jenna laughs)

08:31.591 --> 08:33.859
You hear that?
She's laughing.

08:33.927 --> 08:35.895
First time since
she found out I was sick.

08:35.962 --> 08:37.097
This is bad.

08:37.166 --> 08:38.499
Why?

08:38.566 --> 08:39.599
You don't want Jenna
to be happy?

08:39.667 --> 08:41.301
I want you to be happy.

08:41.368 --> 08:42.735
It's my doggod-damned job!
(Drew and Jenna laugh)

08:42.802 --> 08:44.471
And it's not going
to be possible

08:44.539 --> 08:46.875
if that horse-hung Neanderthal
is back in Jenna's life.

08:46.942 --> 08:49.076
He's not here for her.
He's here for you.

08:49.144 --> 08:51.077
Jenna and I are fine.

08:51.145 --> 08:53.147
Now let's just do what we can
to make everyone comfortable.

08:53.216 --> 08:55.850
I don't think Drew's going
to be too comfortable.

08:55.918 --> 08:58.122
What does that mean?

08:58.191 --> 09:01.562
Dog works
in mysterious ways, Ryan.

09:01.629 --> 09:04.464
(Jenna and Drew laughing)

09:07.904 --> 09:09.340
Oh, my God.
What's so funny?

09:09.408 --> 09:11.175
Oh, I was just filling Jenna in

09:11.242 --> 09:12.976
on the Sheboygan social scene.

09:13.044 --> 09:15.012
Our friends Dan and
Marta just found out

09:15.080 --> 09:16.715
that they're
pregnant with twins...

09:16.783 --> 09:18.050
Again!
...again!

09:18.118 --> 09:19.918
(laughs)

09:19.986 --> 09:22.321
Oh, classic Dan and Marta.

09:22.389 --> 09:24.222
(Jenna and Ryan laugh)

09:24.290 --> 09:29.595
So, it's getting kind of...
kind of late.

09:29.663 --> 09:31.964
Oh, yeah, I'm still
on Sheboygan time,

09:32.031 --> 09:34.702
so for me it's... 9:30?

09:34.770 --> 09:36.038
Wilfy needs his rest.

09:36.105 --> 09:38.040
That's cool.

09:38.108 --> 09:40.478
I'll just get up early
and do yoga.

09:40.546 --> 09:42.414
When did you start doing yoga?

09:42.482 --> 09:43.682
When I moved back to Sheboygan.

09:44.951 --> 09:46.919
Hey, you still take
that 6:30 class?

09:46.986 --> 09:48.552
Every morning.
Well...

09:48.620 --> 09:50.620
if you don't mind,
maybe I'll join you.

09:50.688 --> 09:54.425
Sure could use a good workout.

09:54.492 --> 09:56.026
(Jenna screams)
DREW: Oh, God!

09:56.094 --> 09:57.560
Wilfred!

09:57.628 --> 09:59.528
Poor Sporty!

09:59.595 --> 10:01.095
Collateral damage.

10:01.163 --> 10:02.633
DREW:
Oh.

10:02.700 --> 10:05.068
Guess I'm sleeping on the floor.

10:05.136 --> 10:06.701
Or perhaps at a hotel.

10:06.769 --> 10:08.169
In Sheboygan.

10:08.236 --> 10:11.003
You can't sleep on the floor.

10:11.071 --> 10:13.502
You can sleep on my couch.

10:15.070 --> 10:16.870
(loud panting)

10:16.938 --> 10:19.407
How could you let this happen?!

10:19.475 --> 10:20.876
What are you talking about?
How could I...?

10:20.944 --> 10:22.708
Not you!

10:22.776 --> 10:25.012
I don't expect anything
from you.

10:25.080 --> 10:26.582
You're just a puny human.

10:26.649 --> 10:28.316
I'm talking about me!

10:31.286 --> 10:34.024
Well, some god I am.

10:34.091 --> 10:36.024
How the hell...

10:36.091 --> 10:37.990
did I not see this coming?

10:38.058 --> 10:39.524
Wilfred, calm down.

10:39.591 --> 10:42.295
My plan backfired, Ryan.

10:42.363 --> 10:46.267
She was yours.

10:46.334 --> 10:50.073
And I've thrown her right
back into Drew's arms.

10:50.140 --> 10:53.174
That's not gonna happen.
They're doing yoga tomorrow, Ryan.

10:53.240 --> 10:55.072
Yoga!

10:55.140 --> 10:57.006
Wilfred...!

10:57.073 --> 10:59.110
Wilfred!
(screaming)

10:59.178 --> 11:02.213
My stupidity

11:02.281 --> 11:03.848
has cost you

11:03.916 --> 11:05.617
your happiness!

11:05.685 --> 11:07.452
I've failed!

11:07.520 --> 11:09.254
(screams)

11:09.322 --> 11:11.691
Wilfred, this isn't good for you.
(sobbing)

11:11.759 --> 11:14.929
You don't get it, Ryan.

11:14.997 --> 11:16.967
I'm out of time.

11:17.035 --> 11:18.901
(crying)

11:18.969 --> 11:20.602
I'm out of goddamn time

11:20.669 --> 11:22.970
and I've failed.

11:23.037 --> 11:24.737
I've failed you.

11:24.805 --> 11:26.240
(sobbing)

11:26.341 --> 11:28.977
(screams)

11:31.346 --> 11:34.082
Wilfred?

11:34.150 --> 11:37.956
Wilfred!
(grunting, gasping)

11:38.023 --> 11:40.656
Wilfred!

11:47.448 --> 11:50.717
Is he in any pain?

11:50.785 --> 11:53.387
Is there anything you can do?

11:53.454 --> 11:56.088
Some... steroid, or...

11:56.156 --> 11:59.424
I can give him something
to make him sleep.

11:59.491 --> 12:00.758
(crying)

12:17.042 --> 12:18.109
(kisses)

12:20.044 --> 12:21.811
(voice breaking):
I love you, Wilfred.

12:28.147 --> 12:30.217
No...

12:33.423 --> 12:34.858
It's okay.

12:34.926 --> 12:36.560
I'll stay here with him.

12:39.065 --> 12:40.600
Oh...

12:40.668 --> 12:41.936
(sighs)

12:42.004 --> 12:43.941
You're a good boy, Wilfy.

12:55.054 --> 12:56.854
Does he know I'm here?

12:56.922 --> 12:58.857
I hope so.

13:01.257 --> 13:03.290
I'm really sorry for your loss.

13:12.065 --> 13:13.964
(door closes)

13:17.336 --> 13:19.270
(deeply sighs)

13:26.876 --> 13:29.244
Wilfred,

13:29.312 --> 13:32.615
I don't know
if you can hear me...

13:32.683 --> 13:36.118
WILFRED:
<i>Yeah, I can hear you, mate.</i>

13:36.186 --> 13:38.388
So this is how it ends.

13:38.456 --> 13:40.559
Afraid so.

13:40.626 --> 13:43.064
What am I gonna do without you?

13:43.132 --> 13:44.499
I guess that's up to you.

13:44.567 --> 13:45.901
But do me a favor.

13:45.969 --> 13:47.836
Have a good cry,

13:47.904 --> 13:49.370
get it all out,

13:49.437 --> 13:51.538
then move on.

13:51.606 --> 13:54.308
Go be happy.

13:54.376 --> 13:57.212
How can I be happy
without my best friend?

13:57.280 --> 13:59.213
I know how you feel.

14:01.349 --> 14:04.050
I asked myself that same
question when Dennis died.

14:04.118 --> 14:05.853
(quiet laugh)

14:05.921 --> 14:09.488
Recognize this place?

14:09.556 --> 14:12.025
RYAN:
The-The painting.

14:12.093 --> 14:13.492
From the basement.

14:14.827 --> 14:18.230
Wilfred...

14:18.298 --> 14:19.698
is the basement...

14:19.766 --> 14:21.265
Heaven?

14:22.836 --> 14:23.937
What do you think?

14:25.376 --> 14:28.175
No.

14:28.243 --> 14:31.178
Maybe.

14:31.246 --> 14:32.646
I don't know what to think.

14:35.682 --> 14:38.284
Then stop thinking.

14:43.853 --> 14:45.221
All your questions
will be answered, Ryan.

14:45.289 --> 14:46.723
Eventually.

14:46.791 --> 14:48.358
But the big answers

14:48.426 --> 14:50.159
are like those missing kids
on the milk cartons.

14:50.227 --> 14:51.794
They don't want to be found.

14:51.862 --> 14:53.831
They'll turn up when
they're ready.

14:53.899 --> 14:55.664
I don't, I don't think
that's right-- they...

14:55.732 --> 14:57.199
It's time to stop digging, mate.

14:59.035 --> 15:00.303
Just be.

15:00.370 --> 15:02.906
Will I ever see you again?

15:06.242 --> 15:08.810
I have to move on.

15:08.878 --> 15:11.445
That's how Mataman rolls.

15:11.513 --> 15:14.048
So you really are a god?

15:14.116 --> 15:17.018
Ryan, do you really
think a guy like you

15:17.086 --> 15:18.620
could get a girl like Jenna

15:18.688 --> 15:20.190
without divine intervention?

15:20.257 --> 15:22.360
Yeah, I'm a god.

15:22.427 --> 15:24.929
You're welcome, by the way.

15:24.997 --> 15:26.630
Thanks, Wilfred.

15:28.299 --> 15:29.633
For everything.

15:29.701 --> 15:31.636
It's been my privilege.

15:33.773 --> 15:35.973
And you're gonna
do fine without me.

15:39.777 --> 15:42.511
I'm done, mate.

15:42.578 --> 15:44.347
You hold on to that.

16:28.203 --> 16:29.770
Need any Stevia for your house?

16:29.838 --> 16:31.372
I'm good.

16:31.439 --> 16:33.607
Six bucks for two cups
of coffee.

16:33.674 --> 16:35.341
At that price, I should've taken

16:35.409 --> 16:36.875
the half-and-half
pitcher, too.

16:40.112 --> 16:42.681
You must really miss him.

16:42.749 --> 16:44.917
Only every second.

16:44.984 --> 16:46.551
I remember when Sneakers died,

16:46.619 --> 16:48.921
you stayed in bed
for three whole days.

16:48.989 --> 16:51.091
I never thought I could
love another dog more.

16:51.159 --> 16:53.864
But you did. So...

16:53.932 --> 16:55.865
maybe you should
get another one.

16:55.933 --> 16:57.232
Wilfred was...

16:57.300 --> 16:59.067
special.

16:59.135 --> 17:01.071
I could never replace him.

17:01.138 --> 17:03.575
And Jenna would see it as
a huge act of betrayal.

17:03.643 --> 17:05.608
How's she holding up?

17:05.676 --> 17:07.846
She's inconsolable.

17:07.914 --> 17:09.482
Crying nonstop.

17:09.550 --> 17:12.252
She and Drew are signing
their divorce papers now.

17:12.319 --> 17:16.054
Hope theirs goes down
better than mine did.

17:16.122 --> 17:18.089
In other news, I got a job.

17:18.156 --> 17:19.824
Going back to medicine.

17:19.892 --> 17:21.825
Really? That's great.

17:21.893 --> 17:24.696
It's for a free clinic, so I'll
only be treating poor people.

17:26.632 --> 17:28.866
But on the plus side,
at least I'll be around people

17:28.934 --> 17:31.202
more miserable than I am.

17:34.507 --> 17:37.277
JENNA: Oh, my God.
(laughing)

17:37.345 --> 17:38.910
What you got there?

17:40.844 --> 17:42.545
(nervous laugh)

17:42.612 --> 17:46.285
Why, this here is, uh, is Jordy.

17:46.352 --> 17:48.989
I'll, uh, I'll go
take him for a walk.

17:51.994 --> 17:53.496
Already?

17:53.563 --> 17:55.066
Uh...

17:55.134 --> 17:56.969
Drew got him this morning.

17:57.036 --> 17:59.236
So it's his dog.

18:01.406 --> 18:03.309
We're gonna raise him together.

18:05.280 --> 18:07.348
I-I don't understand.

18:07.416 --> 18:10.688
We couldn't sign
the papers, Ryan.

18:10.756 --> 18:13.089
This week has been
so awful, and...

18:13.156 --> 18:14.590
and Drew's been so great.

18:14.658 --> 18:16.960
You told me you needed
some time alone,

18:17.028 --> 18:19.328
so I stayed away.

18:19.396 --> 18:21.662
I-I didn't try to fix you.
I know,

18:21.730 --> 18:23.295
and I thought that's
what I wanted, but...

18:23.363 --> 18:24.529
I can't believe this.

18:24.597 --> 18:26.233
Drew and I have
a history together, and

18:26.300 --> 18:28.865
most of that history
is really good. It...

18:28.933 --> 18:31.000
it just got bad
when we came to L.A.

18:31.068 --> 18:32.435
What about the mask?

18:32.502 --> 18:34.369
What about being
who you really are?

18:34.437 --> 18:36.539
I-I overstated that.

18:36.606 --> 18:39.041
It's-It's not true.
Yes, it is.

18:39.109 --> 18:40.670
I think that's maybe
the only true thing

18:40.711 --> 18:42.778
you've ever said to me.

18:42.846 --> 18:44.580
I know you're hurt...

18:44.647 --> 18:47.249
You said you were finally
finding yourself with me.

18:47.316 --> 18:48.883
Why don't you want that anymore?

18:50.453 --> 18:52.622
You don't understand.
No.

18:52.689 --> 18:54.824
You know what?
I think I do.

18:54.892 --> 18:56.760
I think I finally get it.

18:56.828 --> 18:58.962
I'm in love with a fantasy.

18:59.030 --> 19:01.264
That-That smiley,
bubbly persona

19:01.332 --> 19:02.732
is just bullshit.

19:02.800 --> 19:05.402
Y-You want to run back
to Wisconsin

19:05.470 --> 19:07.373
and play it safe
instead of taking a risk

19:07.441 --> 19:09.677
and maybe finding
real happiness.

19:11.916 --> 19:13.351
I'm sorry.

19:13.419 --> 19:16.189
Me, too.

19:16.257 --> 19:18.593
I'm sorry for you.

19:24.166 --> 19:25.334
Hey, Ryan...?

19:36.842 --> 19:39.145
