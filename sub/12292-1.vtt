02:51.547 --> 02:53.382
Sam.

03:06.062 --> 03:10.525
How much time did you spend at
the dresser compared to last week?

03:10.566 --> 03:13.694
- Less.
- How much less?

03:15.571 --> 03:17.532
I don't know exactly.

03:18.074 --> 03:20.910
You wanna make a guess,
roughly, for the week?

03:21.577 --> 03:24.831
Oh, not even an hour a day.

03:25.581 --> 03:27.625
And...

03:28.084 --> 03:32.088
...how long has it been now,
since your loss?

03:32.098 --> 03:34.549
You're hoping I guess again,
aren't you?

03:35.091 --> 03:36.634
How long?

03:37.093 --> 03:39.585
Fourteen months, six days.

03:39.595 --> 03:43.265
I can tell you what time it was, down
to the hour and minute if you want.

03:44.099 --> 03:45.809
I can't help it.

03:46.600 --> 03:49.937
It's all right.
It's just a memory doing its job.

04:14.128 --> 04:16.005
- Hello?
- Hey, what are you doing?

04:16.130 --> 04:19.800
I'm just running out the door. I'm late
for my appointment with Munce.

04:20.634 --> 04:23.637
Listen, I was thinking maybe
we could go out to dinner tonight.

04:23.647 --> 04:28.350
I don't know. I think l'd
rather stay home. I'm sorry.

04:28.642 --> 04:30.603
All right, well, that's fine.

04:30.644 --> 04:33.022
I'll cook something fancy.

04:33.147 --> 04:34.815
No, no, no.

04:35.149 --> 04:36.442
It's too much for you.

04:37.151 --> 04:38.861
No, I want to.

04:40.154 --> 04:42.364
Jim, I want to, okay?

04:46.160 --> 04:48.152
- Hey, Eliot.
- I miss you, sweetie.

04:48.162 --> 04:50.873
- Where have you been?
- I know. I haven't called.

04:51.165 --> 04:55.127
Don't be silly. I didn't mean it like that.
We haven't hung out in a while.

04:55.169 --> 04:59.090
- Give me a call, we'll do something.
- I'd love to. Bye.

05:08.182 --> 05:09.433
You need some help?

05:09.683 --> 05:12.686
I parked my car here.
Right here, last night.

05:12.696 --> 05:14.355
What kind of car is it?

05:14.688 --> 05:16.732
Red Volvo.

05:21.694 --> 05:23.186
Thanks.

05:23.196 --> 05:24.572
I forget all the time.

05:27.200 --> 05:30.662
Jim says I have a death grip
on the past.

05:31.704 --> 05:33.039
How are you getting along?

05:34.207 --> 05:37.000
Did you fight at all this week?

05:37.209 --> 05:40.546
Jim doesn't fight. He negotiates.

05:42.214 --> 05:45.467
Are you comfortable physically?
How's the sex?

05:48.220 --> 05:51.348
How would you feel
if I asked you that question?

05:51.723 --> 05:53.642
How's the sex with Mrs. Munce?

05:53.725 --> 05:55.060
Would you answer?

05:55.227 --> 05:57.855
Yes, but I'd have to
charge you more.

06:06.738 --> 06:09.908
- What's wrong?
- l-- I had my coffee.

06:10.242 --> 06:11.452
No, not today.

06:11.743 --> 06:13.203
No, I just had some.

06:13.245 --> 06:15.414
I offered, but you said no this time.

06:15.748 --> 06:18.000
Last time, you had a cup.

06:19.251 --> 06:21.086
Memory slips.

06:21.253 --> 06:23.881
I didn't forget.
I can still taste the coffee.

06:24.757 --> 06:26.592
You...

06:26.759 --> 06:30.429
You smell my coffee, and you
manufacture a memory, a taste.

06:30.763 --> 06:32.222
That's all.

06:32.264 --> 06:34.224
You do hang on hard.

06:36.268 --> 06:38.479
Sometimes the mind...

06:38.771 --> 06:41.899
...needs help in letting a thing go.

06:42.274 --> 06:44.860
You expect me to let go of my son?

06:49.281 --> 06:53.285
You think you amplify
some of these memories of Sam?

06:53.295 --> 06:54.620
Add to them?

06:56.789 --> 06:58.123
No.

06:58.290 --> 06:59.708
Why would l?

07:08.299 --> 07:10.337
Hey. What's the occasion?

07:10.347 --> 07:12.386
You going back to work.

07:12.804 --> 07:15.473
- I think it's great.
- It's just a freelance edit job.

07:15.807 --> 07:18.726
- Not even sure I wanna do it.
- I think you should do it.

07:18.810 --> 07:21.813
It could be great for you.
What's the book?

07:22.313 --> 07:24.940
Psychotic Women and the Men
Who Love Them.

07:29.319 --> 07:31.988
No, I'm kidding.
It's a children's book.

07:33.323 --> 07:35.909
Sorry. Sorry.

07:36.326 --> 07:37.317
I'm sorry.

07:37.327 --> 07:40.580
Let me get the nice glasses
your mother gave us. Okay?

07:40.831 --> 07:43.500
- Speaking of psychotics.
- Yeah.

07:45.836 --> 07:48.672
What kind of a kids' book is it?

08:03.854 --> 08:05.522
What have you done, Jim?

08:05.856 --> 08:07.649
- What?
- What have you done?

08:07.858 --> 08:09.526
- Telly.
- Why'd you change the picture?

08:09.860 --> 08:12.863
- I didn't change anything.
- Think this helps? Taking him away?

08:12.873 --> 08:15.073
- Calm down.
- I want the picture of the three of us.

08:15.365 --> 08:19.244
What did you think, that l
wouldn't notice? I wouldn't care?

08:57.907 --> 09:00.910
I come here hoping
to meet other swingers.

09:01.911 --> 09:03.120
You're the first one.

09:04.914 --> 09:08.250
We know each other. I'm Telly.

09:08.417 --> 09:12.796
Remember? Telly Paretta.
Sam's mom?

09:13.922 --> 09:17.258
We're all tired of condolences,
but I miss Lauren too.

09:21.429 --> 09:23.681
Well, I'm...

09:24.933 --> 09:28.770
I'm done for the night, so I gotta go.

09:28.937 --> 09:30.605
You don't remember me.

09:30.939 --> 09:35.068
- Sure. You want my swing?
- No.

09:36.945 --> 09:39.280
Do you want to come home
with me?

09:39.447 --> 09:42.200
- Just live over there.
- Good night, Ash.

09:43.451 --> 09:44.786
You do know me.

09:46.955 --> 09:49.791
That's why you won't
come home with me.

10:26.994 --> 10:28.787
Jim.

10:32.499 --> 10:35.210
Please don't ask me to let go.

10:37.504 --> 10:39.381
Jim.

10:53.020 --> 10:54.438
Mom, look.

11:03.029 --> 11:05.031
Hurry up, Mom.

11:13.039 --> 11:15.958
- There's your plane.
- Yeah, I know.

12:22.607 --> 12:24.443
Sam.

13:08.652 --> 13:10.529
Jim Paretta, please.

13:12.156 --> 13:14.366
Yeah, I'll take the voice mail.

13:19.163 --> 13:20.664
I can't--

13:21.665 --> 13:25.795
I can't believe what you did
with the book and...

13:26.170 --> 13:29.131
And I was so good...

13:29.173 --> 13:33.844
...with the photos and the lock.

13:34.178 --> 13:36.597
You still...

13:37.181 --> 13:39.475
Do you want to make me hate you?

13:40.184 --> 13:42.435
Do you want to make me hate you?

14:06.209 --> 14:07.585
Please, oh, please.

14:07.710 --> 14:10.338
Please. Please.

14:51.253 --> 14:52.921
Telly?

14:54.256 --> 14:55.841
Telly.

15:01.764 --> 15:03.640
I can't...

15:04.767 --> 15:06.393
...be with you anymore.

15:08.771 --> 15:10.481
I don't wanna see you anymore.

15:10.773 --> 15:13.108
- Telly, wait.
- The book...

15:13.275 --> 15:15.819
The book, I can lose, but--

15:18.280 --> 15:20.272
You erased our son.

15:20.282 --> 15:23.242
You erased my boy.
You made it all blank.

15:23.785 --> 15:26.746
- You took him away.
- Stop. They were always blank.

15:26.788 --> 15:31.000
- What? What are you saying?
- You're healing. You're coming back.

15:31.292 --> 15:33.961
- Dr. Munce is coming.
- Let me go! Let me go!

15:34.295 --> 15:37.298
This is good.
God, Telly, this is real.

15:37.308 --> 15:39.884
The tapes were always blank.

15:41.302 --> 15:43.471
Do you know what he's telling me?

15:44.305 --> 15:45.640
Yes.

15:46.808 --> 15:48.559
Is he psychotic?

15:50.311 --> 15:51.854
No.

15:54.315 --> 15:56.150
My child.

15:57.318 --> 15:59.570
My Sam.

16:00.822 --> 16:02.365
Telly.

16:03.324 --> 16:06.285
There was never a Sam Paretta.

16:06.828 --> 16:08.162
You never had a son.

16:09.831 --> 16:11.541
- This is insane.
- I'm so sorry.

16:11.833 --> 16:13.793
I wanted to help you slowly.

16:13.835 --> 16:16.671
- Gently. But I never thought you--
- He erased the tapes.

16:16.838 --> 16:19.215
He replaced the book.
How can you believe him?

16:19.340 --> 16:21.217
Sam, he grew up. He was 9.

16:21.342 --> 16:23.636
Nine. I had nine years of memories.

16:23.845 --> 16:25.805
Invented memories, Telly.
It happens.

16:26.347 --> 16:28.839
People do this.
It's called paramnesia.

16:28.849 --> 16:31.184
- You imagined a life--
- Everyone remembers Sam.

16:31.351 --> 16:32.769
- Everyone.
- Telly.

16:32.853 --> 16:34.187
You had a miscarriage.

16:34.354 --> 16:37.190
Your life was in danger.
The baby was premature.

16:37.858 --> 16:41.737
- lt was stillborn. You almost died.
- Stop it.

16:41.862 --> 16:44.630
Post-traumatic shock.
It affects everyone differently.

16:44.640 --> 16:47.409
Some people actually invent
entire alternate lives...

16:47.868 --> 16:50.287
...with imagined friends
and lovers and children.

16:50.370 --> 16:53.707
Stop. Why are you doing this?
Why are you trying to take him away?

16:53.874 --> 16:56.585
I made him up? I made him up?

17:01.380 --> 17:04.215
This is so simple.
There are photographs.

17:05.384 --> 17:08.053
People with your condition
look at a photo and see...

17:08.387 --> 17:11.348
...what their mind tells them to see.
You used to see Sam.

17:11.390 --> 17:13.929
- No. Sam took that picture.
- You're recovering.

17:13.939 --> 17:16.479
There was a woman.
We asked her to take a picture...

17:16.896 --> 17:20.566
...and that's the one that Jim took away.
We have a million photographs.

17:20.900 --> 17:23.402
No. No, he took the real book away!

17:23.412 --> 17:25.320
Telly.

17:26.906 --> 17:30.618
Telly, I was hoping we could do this
without hospitalizing you.

17:41.420 --> 17:43.672
All right, all right.

17:44.924 --> 17:47.259
No, there-- There...

17:47.426 --> 17:49.386
There are...

17:49.929 --> 17:53.224
There are photos that he didn't take.

17:54.433 --> 17:56.185
I'll show you.

17:56.435 --> 17:59.939
And we'll end this. We'll end this.

18:24.462 --> 18:25.839
Telly.

18:25.964 --> 18:27.924
Let's just sit down.

18:36.975 --> 18:38.435
Telly.

18:45.983 --> 18:47.276
Telly! Telly!

18:47.484 --> 18:51.155
Where are you going?
Where are you-- ? Telly!

19:10.007 --> 19:12.134
I need to see some newspapers.

19:12.509 --> 19:14.344
Daily papers from 14 months ago.

19:21.518 --> 19:23.771
You need to fill this out.

19:44.541 --> 19:46.376
What papers do you need?

19:50.547 --> 19:52.299
How could-- ?

19:52.549 --> 19:55.010
How could it not be
in any of these?

19:55.552 --> 19:57.554
You sure of the date?

19:59.556 --> 20:01.225
What are you trying to find?

20:01.558 --> 20:05.061
"Six Brooklyn Children Feared Dead
in Missing Plane."

20:07.063 --> 20:08.856
How could it not-- ?

20:10.066 --> 20:11.275
I have to go.

20:12.068 --> 20:13.903
I have to go.

20:33.588 --> 20:35.549
- Eliot.
- Christ.

20:35.590 --> 20:37.717
Telly. What are you doing
in the dark?

20:38.093 --> 20:39.511
What's wrong?

20:39.594 --> 20:41.054
I had a fight with Jim.

20:41.596 --> 20:43.432
Oh, I'm sorry. Come inside.

20:43.598 --> 20:45.559
We fought about Sam.

20:46.101 --> 20:47.310
I'm sorry, about what?

20:49.604 --> 20:51.596
Sam.

20:51.606 --> 20:53.442
Sam. Who's Sam, sweetie?

20:54.609 --> 20:57.529
Eliot, he's my son.

20:58.113 --> 20:59.614
Your son?

21:00.115 --> 21:01.992
El, please.

21:02.617 --> 21:05.110
You knew my son.
You babysat him a thousand times.

21:05.120 --> 21:08.081
- I don't know what you're trying to say.
- You knew my son.

21:08.623 --> 21:11.042
You talked to him,
you took him to a Mets game...

21:11.126 --> 21:13.545
...you bought him a hat.
He always wore that hat.

21:13.628 --> 21:15.964
You're scaring me.
Tell me what's wrong.

21:17.132 --> 21:19.009
Telly?

21:22.637 --> 21:24.139
Telly!

21:26.141 --> 21:27.642
Telly!

21:48.163 --> 21:49.372
Who the hell is it?

21:49.664 --> 21:53.000
It's Telly Paretta. Ash, please.

21:53.167 --> 21:54.794
Are you gonna go away?

21:55.169 --> 21:56.837
No.

22:04.677 --> 22:06.054
Remember me?

22:07.180 --> 22:08.431
Yeah.

22:09.682 --> 22:11.643
Who am l?

22:13.686 --> 22:16.064
You're in worse shape than I am.

22:33.206 --> 22:34.666
What the hell are you doing?

22:35.208 --> 22:38.545
I was here once before,
with my son.

22:38.711 --> 22:41.631
- Do you remember?
- You an old fan, is that it?

22:42.215 --> 22:45.218
Oh, yeah. That's--
That's right. You--

22:45.228 --> 22:46.970
You were a hockey player.

22:47.220 --> 22:50.390
Ex-Ranger.
Lauren was very proud of that.

22:50.723 --> 22:53.893
- Well, tell Lauren I appreciate it.
- I don't follow hockey.

22:54.227 --> 22:56.187
My son, Sam, was a baseball fan.

22:56.730 --> 22:58.565
Oh, baseball.

22:59.232 --> 23:01.234
It's a great game.

23:01.735 --> 23:04.863
The only sport you can play
while taking a nap.

23:05.739 --> 23:08.742
- You drinking?
- No, I just wanted to talk to you.

23:08.752 --> 23:09.951
About what?

23:10.744 --> 23:14.080
- Your daughter.
- I don't have a daughter.

23:14.748 --> 23:16.249
Do you get drunk every night?

23:19.753 --> 23:23.006
No. Sometimes I'm drunk by noon.

23:24.257 --> 23:27.427
- What do you want?
- I had a son.

23:27.761 --> 23:29.753
My son and your daughter
were friends...

23:29.763 --> 23:33.099
...and I'd come here sometimes
to drop Sam off or pick Lauren up.

23:33.266 --> 23:35.518
Can we talk about this after?

23:36.269 --> 23:37.771
After what?

23:38.271 --> 23:40.315
After I sleep.

23:45.276 --> 23:47.904
Somebody else has a daughter,
you know.

23:49.280 --> 23:51.824
Somebody else knows your son.

23:54.285 --> 23:55.953
It's not me.

24:04.796 --> 24:06.422
That's nice.

26:13.422 --> 26:14.799
Did we get married?

26:16.425 --> 26:17.635
It's not me.

26:17.927 --> 26:19.762
It's you. It's Jim.

26:19.929 --> 26:22.932
I don't know who else or what else.

26:22.942 --> 26:24.683
I don't know anything.

26:24.934 --> 26:27.812
I don't know why
it's not in the papers.

26:27.937 --> 26:29.438
I don't know anything.

26:29.939 --> 26:33.192
But it's not me. I'm not insane.

26:33.442 --> 26:36.612
Go look in your office.
It used to be your daughter's room.

26:39.949 --> 26:43.786
You let her draw on it.
These are her drawings.

26:43.953 --> 26:46.580
- What did you do?
- She was showing Sam her room.

26:46.956 --> 26:49.125
I was there. Her bed was here.

26:49.458 --> 26:52.461
Her desk was here, with pictures
from magazines, collaged.

26:52.471 --> 26:55.381
- You're out of your mind.
- This was her room.

26:55.965 --> 26:59.468
Somebody lived here before me.
They papered over their kid's room.

26:59.478 --> 27:02.971
- I'm calling the cops.
- We were there, at the awful funerals.

27:03.471 --> 27:05.760
- You and me and your ex-wife.
- Get out!

27:05.770 --> 27:08.059
You seemed much more
upset than your wife.

27:08.476 --> 27:10.437
She was like my husband,
she held it in.

27:10.478 --> 27:13.106
- But you and l--
- Listen, listen, listen!

27:13.481 --> 27:16.474
We have never met at a funeral.
I do not know you.

27:16.484 --> 27:20.154
Lauren and Sam were friends.
We put them on a plane together...

27:20.487 --> 27:23.490
...to go to camp, and we lost them.
They died over a year ago.

27:23.500 --> 27:25.325
- Come on.
- You weren't drinking then.

27:28.495 --> 27:31.373
- How do you know that?
- I met you.

27:31.498 --> 27:33.500
You weren't like this.

27:34.001 --> 27:37.629
It was about 14 months ago
you started drinking, wasn't it?

27:40.007 --> 27:41.467
Wasn't it?

27:42.009 --> 27:43.635
That's when Lauren died.

27:44.511 --> 27:47.264
- I never had a kid.
- You remembered her before this.

27:47.514 --> 27:50.309
Everybody remembered our children.
Something happened...

27:50.517 --> 27:54.438
...in the last weeks or days, I don't know,
but our children have been forgotten.

27:54.521 --> 27:57.858
- That's it. Let's go. Come on!
- No, no! Say her name, and I'll go!

27:58.025 --> 27:59.735
I say his name every day!

28:00.027 --> 28:02.488
Just say it.

28:02.529 --> 28:05.532
So you can hear it. Lauren.

28:06.033 --> 28:07.826
Say it.

28:10.037 --> 28:11.789
Lauren.

28:12.539 --> 28:14.583
Now look around again.

28:18.545 --> 28:20.339
She was here.

28:21.548 --> 28:23.383
She lived here.

28:27.054 --> 28:28.555
- I need a minute.
- Tell me if--

28:28.565 --> 28:30.015
I need a minute.

28:50.576 --> 28:53.704
- Do you want some coffee?
- No, thanks.

28:59.585 --> 29:01.796
I know this is difficult.

29:03.089 --> 29:05.216
How much do you remember?

29:15.100 --> 29:16.518
I-- I called the police.

29:18.603 --> 29:21.565
Look, you need some help.
I never had a kid.

29:22.607 --> 29:25.026
You gotta get some help. I'm--

29:25.610 --> 29:27.571
I'm real sorry.

29:35.120 --> 29:36.705
Yeah.

29:42.043 --> 29:43.587
One second, okay?

29:48.049 --> 29:49.468
It's the best thing.

29:49.551 --> 29:52.137
They say I dreamed it all.

29:52.554 --> 29:54.139
Do you think I dreamed it?

29:55.057 --> 29:56.725
We have to go.

30:25.086 --> 30:27.922
Hi. Carl Dayton,
National Security Agency.

30:28.089 --> 30:30.549
Telly Paretta? We're taking custody.

30:30.591 --> 30:34.470
- Can I see some lD?
- Check with Captain Mills. He'll verify.

30:50.111 --> 30:51.362
Hi, Dad.

30:58.118 --> 30:59.911
Sorry, Dad.

31:05.125 --> 31:07.794
Which one do you think
I should wear, Daddy?

31:17.137 --> 31:19.264
Wait! Wait!

31:19.639 --> 31:21.933
- Where is she?
- The feds have her.

31:28.648 --> 31:30.233
Stop.

31:32.652 --> 31:34.988
- You gotta let her go.
- Mr. Correll, step back.

31:35.155 --> 31:36.865
You don't understand.

31:37.157 --> 31:38.950
Telly. Get off--

31:40.660 --> 31:43.163
- I remember. I remember.
- Get off.

31:43.173 --> 31:45.081
I remember.

31:46.166 --> 31:47.834
- Get him off the car!
- I remember.

31:48.168 --> 31:50.462
Get off me. She's right!

31:56.676 --> 31:59.012
- Grab his hands!
- Run!

32:02.181 --> 32:03.724
Run!

32:06.185 --> 32:08.103
Run!

33:45.282 --> 33:49.119
- T-E-L-L...?
- Y. Telly.

33:49.786 --> 33:52.122
They told me there was
a complaint against her.

33:52.289 --> 33:54.458
She trashed an apartment
and wouldn't leave.

33:54.791 --> 33:58.795
- Who? Whose apartment?
- Mr. Ashley Correll. Do you know him?

33:58.805 --> 34:00.422
- No.
- Ex-New York Ranger.

34:00.797 --> 34:03.258
- Pretty good.
- What does he have to do-- ?

34:03.300 --> 34:05.594
She was claiming her son
was missing and dead.

34:05.802 --> 34:07.137
We never had a son.

34:08.304 --> 34:09.514
Why would she say that?

34:09.806 --> 34:12.809
My wife is delusional.
She needs help.

34:12.819 --> 34:14.728
Where is she?

34:15.312 --> 34:17.147
She was turned over
to federal agents.

34:17.813 --> 34:20.306
And she fled custody.
Now, Mr. Paretta...

34:20.317 --> 34:23.277
...why would the NSA
be interested in your wife?

34:23.820 --> 34:26.813
You're asking me?
This is crazy.

34:26.822 --> 34:28.909
They don't care about
anybody's apartment.

34:29.326 --> 34:34.205
- And they don't trace missing children.
- There was never a child.

35:13.369 --> 35:14.870
Do what they say, all right?

35:14.880 --> 35:16.705
Okay. I love you.

35:19.375 --> 35:21.584
I'm gonna miss you so much.

35:22.877 --> 35:24.629
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

35:25.880 --> 35:27.841
Have fun.

35:27.882 --> 35:29.509
I love you, Mommy.

35:29.884 --> 35:31.469
- Sam.
- Yeah?

35:31.886 --> 35:35.265
- See you.
- See you.

36:11.926 --> 36:13.553
I was hoping you'd come here.

36:13.928 --> 36:15.263
Me too.

36:23.937 --> 36:25.898
I don't understand it.

36:28.942 --> 36:31.612
I keep thinking I'm crazy, you know?

36:32.446 --> 36:33.697
How could I forget her?

36:34.448 --> 36:36.200
My little girl.

36:37.451 --> 36:39.443
How-- ?

36:39.453 --> 36:40.829
I can't do this.

36:41.455 --> 36:43.290
You have to.

36:43.957 --> 36:46.251
Because I can't do this alone.

36:50.964 --> 36:53.008
Come on, we shouldn't
hang around here.

36:58.972 --> 37:01.557
First, I thought it had to do
with the plane crash.

37:01.974 --> 37:04.477
Remember when that flight
crashed over Long lsland...

37:04.487 --> 37:06.854
...and everybody thought
it was friendly fire...

37:06.979 --> 37:08.398
...some government cover-up?

37:08.981 --> 37:11.645
- Yeah, I remember that.
- But then I thought...

37:11.655 --> 37:14.320
...how could the government
erase our memories?

37:14.487 --> 37:17.323
It's just not possible. It's so--

37:17.490 --> 37:18.991
- What?
- Please don't think...

37:19.492 --> 37:22.245
- ...I'm out of my mind.
- I don't anymore.

37:22.495 --> 37:26.165
Do you ever feel like somebody-- ?

37:26.499 --> 37:29.001
Something's watching you?

37:29.502 --> 37:30.962
Like surveillance?

37:31.003 --> 37:35.133
No, I mean that sometimes
people are...

37:35.508 --> 37:38.052
...taken. We hear that.

37:39.512 --> 37:42.515
- What are you talking about?
- Abduction.

37:47.520 --> 37:50.106
You're freaking me out.
I'm having a National Enquirer moment.

37:50.523 --> 37:52.316
No, listen to me.
What do we know?

37:52.525 --> 37:55.017
I had a son, you had a daughter,
they had lives...

37:55.027 --> 37:58.448
...they died, and everyone besides us
believes they never existed.

37:58.531 --> 38:00.908
What could do something like that?

38:01.534 --> 38:03.526
No. There's gotta be
another explanation.

38:03.536 --> 38:07.039
Who could erase our kids?
Every-- Every picture of them gone.

38:07.049 --> 38:10.876
Every newspaper article gone.
Every memory gone.

38:11.043 --> 38:13.420
No agents. No government.
Who could do that?

38:15.547 --> 38:17.090
I don't know.

38:23.555 --> 38:26.141
We need to find a hotel.
You got any cash?

38:26.558 --> 38:28.685
No, not much.
I have some credit cards.

38:29.561 --> 38:32.355
Forget it. Clerk runs your card,
and they got us.

38:32.564 --> 38:34.066
Don't you watch TV?

38:34.076 --> 38:35.484
I read.

38:38.070 --> 38:39.446
Goddamn snob.

38:40.072 --> 38:45.159
No. Goddamn editor.
Why are you so pissed at me?

38:48.579 --> 38:51.207
- You okay?
- Yeah.

38:52.083 --> 38:53.751
My door.

38:54.085 --> 38:56.587
- NSA! We need to talk to you!
- Just stay by the car!

38:56.597 --> 38:58.672
Stay by the car!

39:29.120 --> 39:30.413
This way!

39:38.629 --> 39:40.047
- Where did they go?
- ln here!

39:59.149 --> 40:00.692
In here!

40:10.160 --> 40:11.953
Get down.

40:16.166 --> 40:18.293
Goddamn it, we've lost them.

40:21.670 --> 40:24.339
All right, search the fields.
We'll check the streets.

40:24.673 --> 40:26.759
All right. Come on.

40:27.676 --> 40:29.428
I got left side.

41:12.221 --> 41:14.223
- Petalis, come in.
- Go for Petalis.

41:16.225 --> 41:18.060
What do you see? Nothing there?

41:18.227 --> 41:20.979
- Yeah, the field's clear.
- Okay, hook up with us.

41:21.230 --> 41:22.773
Okay. I'm coming back to you.

41:23.232 --> 41:24.983
What's your 20?

41:55.763 --> 41:58.099
- Hello?
- Dr. Munce, it's Telly.

41:58.266 --> 42:02.144
Telly. Where are you?
Are you all right?

42:03.270 --> 42:04.646
No.

42:04.771 --> 42:09.735
I mean, I'm not hurt,
but there are people after us.

42:09.776 --> 42:10.986
What? What do you mean?

42:11.278 --> 42:13.155
I found someone else.

42:13.280 --> 42:16.283
His daughter was on the same flight.
He didn't remember her.

42:16.783 --> 42:18.243
But now he does.

42:18.285 --> 42:20.078
How do you explain that?

42:20.287 --> 42:22.748
How do you explain
the people chasing us?

42:23.790 --> 42:27.252
Telly, this is a panic attack.
You just hold on, all right?

42:27.794 --> 42:32.132
Now, tell me where you are,
I'll leave right away. You need help.

42:33.300 --> 42:36.636
No, I need you to start believing me.

42:53.820 --> 42:55.906
Found an all-night place.

42:58.825 --> 43:00.285
Didn't have much.

43:06.833 --> 43:08.335
You should eat something.

43:08.835 --> 43:12.839
Just deciding whether I want
too much salt or too much sugar.

43:12.849 --> 43:14.758
Sugar.

43:27.354 --> 43:28.980
Wish you wouldn't do that.

43:30.857 --> 43:32.067
Don't worry about it.

43:40.366 --> 43:42.826
Think I'm just gonna go to bed.

44:08.393 --> 44:10.562
- You held out.
- What?

44:10.895 --> 44:14.274
You held out and I didn't.
I forgot her.

44:14.399 --> 44:16.818
- How'd you do that?
- I don't know.

44:16.901 --> 44:20.822
What's so important about us?
Or our kids?

44:23.408 --> 44:25.201
I mean, the kids are dead.

44:25.410 --> 44:27.328
Why try to erase our memories?

44:27.912 --> 44:30.248
It's not like we're gonna
go look for them.

44:55.440 --> 44:57.108
Sam.

45:27.970 --> 45:29.806
Ash.

45:29.972 --> 45:32.725
Ash. Wake up.

45:33.976 --> 45:35.603
Come on.

45:35.978 --> 45:38.648
Come on, wake up. Wake up.

45:40.483 --> 45:42.777
Wake up, wake up.
Come on. Wake up.

45:42.985 --> 45:44.607
Wake up.

45:44.617 --> 45:46.239
Wake up!

45:52.495 --> 45:54.080
Ash.

45:54.997 --> 45:56.749
Ash.

45:56.999 --> 45:58.876
Wake up.

45:59.001 --> 46:01.170
- Listen to me.
- What the hell are you doing?

46:01.504 --> 46:03.339
- You nutjob!
- Listen to me.

46:03.506 --> 46:05.717
You didn't know it,
but you were right.

46:06.008 --> 46:08.386
If the children were dead,
they would leave it.

46:08.511 --> 46:11.514
If we all thought they were dead,
why would they erase them?

46:12.014 --> 46:14.016
Why would they need
to make us forget them?

46:14.026 --> 46:15.810
I think the children are alive.

46:16.018 --> 46:19.981
That's why I can still feel him, why
I can't let go. The children are alive.

46:20.523 --> 46:22.900
Don't you feel that
Lauren's alive out there?

46:23.025 --> 46:24.527
I don't know, maybe.

46:32.035 --> 46:33.244
Yes.

46:36.539 --> 46:39.500
Jim usually leaves the office
by 12:15.

46:40.043 --> 46:42.035
We need to get Jim alone.

46:42.045 --> 46:45.548
- What's he like?
- We had our problems.

46:46.549 --> 46:48.384
He loved Sam.

46:49.052 --> 46:51.137
Make him say Sam's name.

46:51.554 --> 46:53.139
Like you made me say "Lauren."

47:09.571 --> 47:11.531
- Watch out!
- Get out of the way!

47:20.081 --> 47:22.083
Behind you!

47:26.087 --> 47:27.296
Get out of the way!

47:31.092 --> 47:32.551
Oh, my God!

47:33.094 --> 47:34.845
- ls he-- ? Did we-- ?
- I don't know.

47:37.098 --> 47:39.100
I've seen him before.

47:39.110 --> 47:40.893
Don't answer it.

47:43.104 --> 47:46.023
- Hello?
- Hello, is this Telly Paretta?

47:46.607 --> 47:49.944
- Who is this?
- Telly, this is Detective Anne Pope.

47:50.111 --> 47:51.602
We didn't mean to hurt anybody.

47:51.612 --> 47:54.448
The man in front of our car
wouldn't get out of the way.

47:54.615 --> 47:57.076
- What?
- We're just trying to find our children.

47:57.118 --> 47:58.786
- Hang up.
- Yes, I know.

47:59.120 --> 48:01.247
- You know?
- I know about your case.

48:01.622 --> 48:03.040
Hang up.

48:03.124 --> 48:04.583
Is that Ashley Correll?

48:04.625 --> 48:05.960
They took our kids.

48:06.127 --> 48:08.462
They made us think
they died in a plane crash.

48:08.629 --> 48:11.424
Anne. Look, I know this doesn't
make any sense...

48:11.632 --> 48:15.177
...but my son, Sam Paretta,
and Ash's daughter, Lauren Correll...

48:15.636 --> 48:17.471
...they were on the same plane.

48:17.638 --> 48:19.130
Now, how could two people...

48:19.140 --> 48:22.643
...remember two different children
if they never existed?

48:51.171 --> 48:52.630
Jim.

48:53.173 --> 48:55.300
Hi. I...

48:56.176 --> 48:57.510
I'm sorry, do I know you?

48:57.677 --> 48:59.471
What's the matter? It's me.

49:01.181 --> 49:02.973
I'm lost. Can you help me out here?

49:04.683 --> 49:07.186
Oh, God, what did they do to you?

49:07.686 --> 49:10.731
It's me. It's Telly.

49:12.191 --> 49:13.984
I'm sorry. We know each other?

49:16.195 --> 49:17.404
I know your wife.

49:19.198 --> 49:22.785
Right. Got it. Not married.
Wrong Jim.

49:23.202 --> 49:25.371
James William Paretta.

49:26.705 --> 49:27.915
Who are you?

49:34.213 --> 49:35.547
Do you know a Sam Paretta?

49:35.714 --> 49:37.674
- No relation.
- Maybe it would help...

49:37.716 --> 49:39.676
...if you said the name. Sam.

49:41.220 --> 49:42.846
You lost me.

49:53.732 --> 49:55.359
What about Jim?

50:04.243 --> 50:05.744
It's them.

50:36.274 --> 50:40.278
We gotta get out of here.
Out of the city, at least for tonight.

50:42.280 --> 50:44.615
I know someplace far enough.

50:46.284 --> 50:50.163
- Telly.
- He didn't even know me.

50:50.288 --> 50:51.997
He forgot me.

51:00.297 --> 51:03.592
Swear to God. They hit the guy,
he crashes into the pump. Look.

51:03.800 --> 51:08.138
Look at that. Then he gets right up.
I didn't just see it, I heard it. Bang.

51:08.305 --> 51:10.807
This guy bounces off
the gas pump, gets right up.

51:10.817 --> 51:12.017
There's no blood.

51:13.310 --> 51:14.895
There's gotta be.

51:15.812 --> 51:18.607
- Feds wanna talk to you.
- What?

51:18.815 --> 51:20.400
Detective Pope.

51:20.817 --> 51:23.236
Okay, wait right here, all right?

51:24.321 --> 51:26.740
I'm Carl Dayton, NSA.

51:27.324 --> 51:30.285
- So you're here to rent a car?
- Pardon?

51:31.328 --> 51:33.455
What are you doing
in my crime scene, Carl?

51:33.830 --> 51:36.323
What's so national security
about this?

51:36.333 --> 51:38.293
- I'm not at liberty to say.
- Liberty to say.

51:38.335 --> 51:40.128
You guys need new material.

51:41.838 --> 51:43.048
We've been on this case.

51:43.340 --> 51:47.803
So any new information
that you get on Paretta or Correll...

51:48.345 --> 51:50.597
...you give me a call any time,
day or night.

51:50.847 --> 51:52.432
You like this part, don't you?

51:52.849 --> 51:55.268
The part where you get
to take away my case.

51:55.352 --> 51:56.978
I'd rather be sailing.

51:57.854 --> 51:59.815
I'm conducting
an investigation here.

51:59.856 --> 52:02.441
And until I know differently,
Paretta and Correll...

52:02.858 --> 52:05.236
...have been breaking only
the laws of New York.

52:05.361 --> 52:08.155
I am the city of New York,
and I'm on it.

52:08.864 --> 52:11.867
Your involvement wouldn't have to do
with the plane crash...

52:11.877 --> 52:15.454
- ...they claim killed their two children?
- Children?

52:16.372 --> 52:17.832
There are no children.

52:20.376 --> 52:22.378
But there was a plane crash.

52:22.388 --> 52:23.587
No.

52:23.879 --> 52:26.048
We know nothing about
a plane crash.

52:27.383 --> 52:29.463
You don't know very much.

52:29.473 --> 52:31.554
National security, huh?

52:31.887 --> 52:34.056
Better buy better locks.

52:59.330 --> 53:01.332
Put your eyes back
in your head, warden.

53:01.833 --> 53:03.334
I'm not looking at you.

53:04.335 --> 53:05.670
I had a wife.

53:05.837 --> 53:09.174
Could feel a woman's eyes judging me
if I was in a coma.

53:10.842 --> 53:12.093
Ash, please don't drink.

53:13.845 --> 53:16.014
See, I told you
you were watching me.

53:16.848 --> 53:18.183
You know what?

53:18.349 --> 53:20.852
- I wish I didn't have to.
- Then don't. I'm sick of hearing it.

53:20.862 --> 53:23.396
Sorry to interrupt your
feeling sorry for yourself.

53:23.855 --> 53:26.024
Well, not all of us
can be heroes, lady.

53:26.357 --> 53:30.362
You think I wouldn't drink that entire
bottle for a few seconds of peace?

53:30.372 --> 53:32.781
You're in this. You don't get
to drink your way out.

53:32.864 --> 53:35.492
What makes you so fucking special?

53:38.370 --> 53:40.330
I let her go.

53:42.873 --> 53:44.124
My little girl.

53:44.875 --> 53:47.669
They took her away from me,
but I let her go.

53:49.380 --> 53:51.590
What kind of father does that?

53:58.889 --> 54:00.849
I need you to stay clear.

54:29.419 --> 54:32.338
- I'm not doing this for you, you know.
- I know.

54:33.423 --> 54:35.758
I'll never forget her again.

54:36.426 --> 54:38.261
I know you won't.

54:38.928 --> 54:40.638
You know everything, right?

54:43.433 --> 54:46.102
I don't know how
to get my son back.

54:52.942 --> 54:54.777
We'll figure something out.

55:04.454 --> 55:07.123
- And?
- Dayton? He is NSA, but it's tagged.

55:07.457 --> 55:10.626
He's got special clearance.
Some unit within the NSA.

55:10.960 --> 55:13.212
- These people are down deep.
- Doing what?

55:13.463 --> 55:16.924
I'd say God only knows,
but I don't think he's in the loop.

55:16.966 --> 55:20.844
I gotta pick up my sister's kid.
Get some sleep.

55:20.969 --> 55:23.462
Good night. I need you
to get that on my desk--

55:23.472 --> 55:26.224
- Excuse me, Lieutenant Pope?
- No, I'm gone, in my car.

55:26.475 --> 55:28.435
- I'm almost home.
- I'm Dr. Jack Munce.

55:28.477 --> 55:30.353
Telly Paretta's my patient.

55:30.979 --> 55:33.398
I'd like to help.
Telly's contacted me.

55:33.482 --> 55:36.485
What can you tell me about Telly
that might help me find her?

55:36.495 --> 55:40.113
I used to think that she was
purely delusional.

55:41.490 --> 55:43.867
I'm not sure anymore.

55:44.993 --> 55:49.247
So how is it that she and Mr. Correll
are having the same delusion...

55:49.498 --> 55:53.335
...making up imaginary children
from the same plane crash?

55:53.502 --> 55:56.004
Well, I don't-- I don't know Correll.

55:56.505 --> 55:58.673
He could be saying anything
to be with her.

55:59.007 --> 56:00.759
Well, if she calls again, call me.

56:01.009 --> 56:04.012
I think it's important
that I'm there when you find her.

56:04.513 --> 56:06.848
You'll be dealing with
a possible psychotic break.

56:07.015 --> 56:08.507
You don't wanna do more damage.

56:08.517 --> 56:12.479
- I'll call you, Dr. Munce.
- No, that's not what I mean.

56:14.022 --> 56:16.775
It's... It's my fault she's out there.

56:17.025 --> 56:18.516
Why?

56:18.526 --> 56:20.152
She was in my care.

56:21.028 --> 56:23.489
She still trusts me,
or she wouldn't have called.

56:23.531 --> 56:29.161
She'll call again, and when she does,
you'll know because I'll be with you.

56:29.537 --> 56:32.540
You're gonna need me to find her.

57:39.606 --> 57:40.857
Oh, shit.

57:41.107 --> 57:42.734
"A. Petalis."

57:43.109 --> 57:45.487
What's the A stand for?

57:49.115 --> 57:50.492
What?

57:53.620 --> 57:55.538
- You don't have to do that.
- This?

57:55.622 --> 57:57.040
Just stop it!

57:58.625 --> 58:00.116
Al.

58:00.126 --> 58:02.379
Al Petalis.

58:04.631 --> 58:08.733
You don't want this kind of trouble,
so just drop it right now. Right now!

58:08.743 --> 58:12.846
Tell him to stop, Miss Paretta,
before this goes any further. Tell him!

58:13.138 --> 58:14.973
We just want our children.

58:15.641 --> 58:19.812
There are no children.
Forget the children.

58:21.146 --> 58:23.816
What did you say?
Did you say to forget the children?

58:24.149 --> 58:26.485
- Who are you?
- Where are the children?

58:26.652 --> 58:29.780
Why were they taken?
Why were the children taken?

58:33.158 --> 58:36.120
If I swing this thing again,
I'm gonna break your kneecap.

58:36.662 --> 58:38.153
I swear it.

58:38.163 --> 58:39.873
Where are the children?

58:40.165 --> 58:43.292
No! No, l--

58:43.668 --> 58:45.837
It's not me, it's...

58:46.671 --> 58:50.216
It's not us. We... We...

58:51.175 --> 58:53.167
We cooperate.

58:53.177 --> 58:55.179
Cooperate with who?

58:55.680 --> 58:57.098
With who?

58:57.181 --> 58:59.058
Why do you cooperate with them?

59:00.685 --> 59:03.229
- Survival.
- Who, yours?

59:03.688 --> 59:04.939
Yours too.

59:07.692 --> 59:08.943
You were right.

59:10.194 --> 59:13.698
Where are they from? Who are they?
Why do they want the children?

59:13.708 --> 59:15.616
Tell us the truth.

59:18.703 --> 59:20.038
The truth.

59:20.204 --> 59:23.833
The goddamn truth
won't fit in your brain.

59:24.709 --> 59:26.200
It won't fit in anybody's brain.

59:26.210 --> 59:28.504
Just tell us how to get
the children back.

59:29.714 --> 59:33.468
I don't know. I don't know
anything about that.

59:33.718 --> 59:38.222
All I know is that you were supposed
to forget like everybody else did.

59:39.223 --> 59:40.600
This was not part of it.

59:41.225 --> 59:43.019
Part of what?

59:43.227 --> 59:45.355
Part of what?

59:48.232 --> 59:50.224
Part of...

59:50.234 --> 59:53.696
...this particular experiment.

59:55.739 --> 59:57.074
- Go on.
- I can't.

59:57.240 --> 59:58.617
- Yes, you can!
- No, I won't.

59:58.742 --> 01:00:01.411
- Yes, you can! Yes, you-- !
- No! No!

01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:08.752
Do you have children?

01:00:15.258 --> 01:00:17.094
Please.

01:00:18.762 --> 01:00:20.471
Please tell me.

01:00:21.263 --> 01:00:23.891
No one will know that you told us.

01:00:24.266 --> 01:00:25.768
Just--

01:00:27.269 --> 01:00:29.146
Just tell us...

01:00:29.271 --> 01:00:32.775
...how to get the children back.

01:00:32.785 --> 01:00:34.819
No one will blame you.

01:00:35.277 --> 01:00:38.989
I swear to you. I swear to you.

01:00:44.286 --> 01:00:46.122
They're listening.

01:01:27.830 --> 01:01:29.498
You okay?

01:01:31.333 --> 01:01:34.795
- Why didn't they take us?
- I don't know.

01:01:39.759 --> 01:01:41.969
Our best guess is a gas leak.

01:01:42.261 --> 01:01:45.221
But nothing's burned.
There's no sign of fire.

01:01:45.764 --> 01:01:47.599
There's no sign of blood.

01:01:48.767 --> 01:01:50.393
Just this.

01:01:52.270 --> 01:01:55.940
"Anne Pope, our children are alive.
We believe they were abducted.

01:01:56.274 --> 01:02:00.903
We know we couldn't sound crazier
if we tried. Please help us."

01:02:01.779 --> 01:02:03.197
Abducted.

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:04.907
That's an interesting word.

01:02:05.282 --> 01:02:07.576
Most people say kidnapped.

01:02:08.786 --> 01:02:12.831
- Troopers found this.
- Excuse us, Dr. Munce.

01:02:16.794 --> 01:02:18.796
Witnesses only saw
Paretta and Correll...

01:02:19.296 --> 01:02:21.590
...running from the cabin
after the explosion.

01:02:21.799 --> 01:02:24.760
And there's no sign
of another body inside.

01:02:25.803 --> 01:02:27.888
Where did this come from?

01:02:31.809 --> 01:02:33.519
Brasher, how old's Cassidy?

01:02:33.811 --> 01:02:35.803
She's 7, why?

01:02:35.813 --> 01:02:39.400
What if I told you your daughter
never existed? That you made her up?

01:02:39.817 --> 01:02:41.193
Why would you do that?

01:02:41.819 --> 01:02:45.489
Yeah. Why?

01:03:10.347 --> 01:03:13.392
QuestAir. The name of the airline,
the small airline.

01:03:13.851 --> 01:03:16.311
It was QuestAir. Remember?

01:03:16.854 --> 01:03:18.846
QuestAir. So...

01:03:18.856 --> 01:03:22.943
So we're saying that
it never crashed at sea.

01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:26.196
We're saying that they
somehow took the kids...

01:03:26.363 --> 01:03:29.491
...and that the--
The plane and the pilot...

01:03:29.867 --> 01:03:32.994
...that all of it,
all of it is part of them.

01:03:33.870 --> 01:03:35.663
QuestAir.

01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:37.849
Oh, my God. Who are you?
What are you doing here?

01:04:37.933 --> 01:04:40.852
Sorry, we didn't think there'd be
anyone here. I'm Claire.

01:04:41.436 --> 01:04:44.564
I'm Mr. Shineer's assistant.
And you are?

01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:48.110
Eileen, the accountant the court
appointed for the bankruptcy.

01:04:48.443 --> 01:04:52.906
- Oh, of course. I'm so sorry.
- That's all right.

01:04:52.948 --> 01:04:55.909
I was told that QuestAir employees
are not allowed here.

01:04:55.951 --> 01:04:58.912
That's okay. Mr. Shineer needs
some items from his office.

01:04:59.454 --> 01:05:02.207
Oh, no. I'm sorry.
Nothing is allowed to leave.

01:05:02.958 --> 01:05:04.459
They're just personal letters.

01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:07.963
Yes, well, if anything turns up,
I'd be happy to have them...

01:05:07.973 --> 01:05:09.506
...sent to Mr. Shineer's home.

01:05:09.965 --> 01:05:11.675
Gonna have to go by court procedure.

01:05:11.967 --> 01:05:16.596
That's fine. The West Side address
isn't good anymore, though, the co-op.

01:05:16.972 --> 01:05:18.181
Which one do you have?

01:05:20.473 --> 01:05:22.434
Where would I have that?

01:05:25.478 --> 01:05:28.356
Let's see what I've got here.

01:05:28.982 --> 01:05:31.776
Okay, Robert Shineer.
I've got the one on Long lsland.

01:05:31.985 --> 01:05:35.155
165 Colony Way.

01:06:15.028 --> 01:06:17.072
Nobody lives here.

01:06:17.530 --> 01:06:19.866
Yeah, that's strange.

01:06:20.033 --> 01:06:22.952
They didn't move out, they just left.

01:07:30.101 --> 01:07:33.229
- Go ahead, you should sleep.
- What about you?

01:07:33.604 --> 01:07:35.732
I'm finally awake.

01:08:03.134 --> 01:08:04.886
- Hey, get in.
- Where are we going?

01:08:05.136 --> 01:08:09.182
They've been lD'd. They scammed an
accountant for an address. Long lsland.

01:08:52.683 --> 01:08:53.892
Ash.

01:09:00.689 --> 01:09:02.817
- Shineer.
- Ash?

01:09:06.696 --> 01:09:08.197
Telly.

01:09:09.198 --> 01:09:12.535
- Look. It's the guy from the car rental.
- I know.

01:09:12.702 --> 01:09:16.162
We have to get to the airport,
the one the kids left from.

01:09:23.212 --> 01:09:24.839
They're in the house with us.

01:09:26.215 --> 01:09:27.925
Come on, let's go.

01:09:41.229 --> 01:09:42.857
It's jammed.

01:10:03.252 --> 01:10:06.166
- Meet me at my apartment.
- What are you doing?

01:10:06.176 --> 01:10:09.091
One of us has gotta get out of here.
Go. Go on. Go!

01:10:17.266 --> 01:10:18.768
Stay here.

01:10:20.268 --> 01:10:22.103
Stay inside.

01:10:34.282 --> 01:10:36.659
Freeze. Right there.
Hands on your head.

01:10:37.285 --> 01:10:40.205
I want you on your knees. Now.

01:10:40.789 --> 01:10:42.082
I will shoot.

01:10:42.791 --> 01:10:44.125
Now.

01:10:48.796 --> 01:10:50.422
Halt!

01:10:54.301 --> 01:10:55.969
Halt!

01:11:08.816 --> 01:11:10.808
- Are you Munce?
- Yes, what happened in there?

01:11:10.818 --> 01:11:13.487
- Where's Telly?
- Telly left. We gotta get out of here.

01:11:13.821 --> 01:11:15.989
- What about Pope?
- You wanna help Telly? Drive.

01:11:16.323 --> 01:11:17.783
Drive!

01:11:18.325 --> 01:11:19.785
Come on.

01:11:33.841 --> 01:11:36.468
Telly! Telly, wait.

01:11:36.844 --> 01:11:39.471
Telly, I'm Anne. Anne Pope.

01:11:39.847 --> 01:11:41.140
No, wait. Please listen.

01:11:41.348 --> 01:11:43.475
I know. I know.

01:11:44.852 --> 01:11:47.855
I believe you, Telly.
I believe you about everything.

01:11:48.355 --> 01:11:51.608
I've seen it.
It's not human. Jesus Christ.

01:11:51.859 --> 01:11:54.351
- And the children?
- Yes, everything.

01:11:54.361 --> 01:11:58.490
We'll find them. I promise you that.
Do you hear me? We will find them.

01:11:59.366 --> 01:12:01.242
We will find your son--

01:12:20.386 --> 01:12:21.763
Telly?

01:12:31.898 --> 01:12:33.191
Ash?

01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:35.484
Ash.

01:12:38.904 --> 01:12:41.031
They took Anne Pope
right in front of me.

01:12:43.909 --> 01:12:44.900
Munce is downstairs.

01:12:44.910 --> 01:12:47.287
- He'll take us to that airport.
- Beautiful view.

01:12:50.415 --> 01:12:52.542
What have you done with our kids?

01:12:58.924 --> 01:13:00.801
Ash.

01:13:00.926 --> 01:13:02.594
- No, Telly. Stay back!
- Ash.

01:13:02.928 --> 01:13:04.680
No!

01:13:05.430 --> 01:13:06.640
Ash!

01:13:07.933 --> 01:13:09.476
No!

01:13:10.435 --> 01:13:12.062
Ash!

01:13:25.951 --> 01:13:27.202
Telly.

01:13:28.453 --> 01:13:30.080
Come with me.

01:13:39.965 --> 01:13:43.384
- We have to go to the police.
- No, we have to go to the airport.

01:13:43.467 --> 01:13:45.803
Please, Telly. We need help.

01:13:53.477 --> 01:13:54.687
Get out.

01:14:00.985 --> 01:14:02.486
No, I'll take you.

01:14:55.538 --> 01:14:59.584
He's one of them.
You have my son. Where is he?

01:15:05.548 --> 01:15:09.177
You know this is getting
out of control.

01:15:09.552 --> 01:15:11.388
It's finished now, end it.

01:15:12.055 --> 01:15:13.890
Make it right.

01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:19.646
Where is my son?

01:15:25.567 --> 01:15:27.319
It's not over.

01:15:39.581 --> 01:15:41.208
You're one of those agents.

01:15:43.085 --> 01:15:45.754
No, I'm just...

01:15:46.588 --> 01:15:48.924
...one of the few who knows.

01:15:49.591 --> 01:15:51.135
So you help them?

01:15:51.593 --> 01:15:55.848
They don't need help. They run their
experiments with or without our help.

01:15:56.598 --> 01:15:59.935
They've been doing it for years.
Maybe forever.

01:16:00.102 --> 01:16:02.396
And you just let them do
whatever they want.

01:16:03.105 --> 01:16:04.565
Let them?

01:16:05.607 --> 01:16:07.234
I don't have a choice.

01:16:07.609 --> 01:16:10.404
We just try to minimize the damage.

01:16:10.612 --> 01:16:12.822
I just want my son.

01:16:14.615 --> 01:16:17.952
Telly, you'll never get Sam back.

01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:22.707
You've held on, and they don't
know why. You're just a lab rat to them.

01:16:23.124 --> 01:16:26.878
I don't believe that. He said
it's not over. I can still get him back.

01:16:28.629 --> 01:16:31.758
You know them. Help me.

01:16:33.634 --> 01:16:37.638
If you go any further,
I can't help you. I'm sorry.

01:17:01.411 --> 01:17:03.205
Is my son in here?

01:17:03.914 --> 01:17:05.916
You never doubted.

01:17:06.416 --> 01:17:08.043
Not for a second, did you?

01:17:08.919 --> 01:17:10.379
He's here.

01:17:10.420 --> 01:17:12.673
He's now just a memory, Telly.

01:17:40.951 --> 01:17:42.953
Can you picture him here?

01:17:44.454 --> 01:17:45.956
Now?

01:17:57.467 --> 01:17:59.094
Sam!

01:17:59.970 --> 01:18:03.097
Honey! Wait!

01:18:13.482 --> 01:18:15.484
Sam!

01:18:18.988 --> 01:18:20.781
Sam!

01:18:30.499 --> 01:18:33.961
What have you done with him? Why
did you take him? What do you want?

01:18:34.003 --> 01:18:35.254
It's an experiment.

01:18:35.504 --> 01:18:41.551
He's just a little boy. What could
you possibly learn from him?

01:18:42.010 --> 01:18:43.511
Nothing.

01:18:45.013 --> 01:18:47.390
This wasn't about Sam.

01:18:49.017 --> 01:18:50.810
This wasn't about the children.

01:18:51.019 --> 01:18:53.355
It was never about the children.

01:18:54.022 --> 01:18:55.523
We were the experiment.

01:18:56.524 --> 01:18:59.517
Your connection, mother to child.

01:18:59.527 --> 01:19:03.490
Like an invisible tissue.
We can even measure its energy.

01:19:03.531 --> 01:19:06.993
But we don't fully understand it,
so I posed the question:

01:19:07.535 --> 01:19:11.039
"Can it be dissolved?"
And it can.

01:19:11.049 --> 01:19:12.582
Except for you.

01:19:13.541 --> 01:19:16.034
Give me back my son...

01:19:16.044 --> 01:19:18.036
...and I'll do whatever you want.

01:19:18.046 --> 01:19:22.509
What I want, Telly,
is for you to forget your son.

01:19:23.051 --> 01:19:25.345
- To forget Sam.
- No.

01:19:25.553 --> 01:19:28.807
If you don't, this experiment will fail.

01:19:29.057 --> 01:19:30.975
I'm accountable.

01:19:31.059 --> 01:19:32.972
I can't let that happen.

01:19:32.982 --> 01:19:34.896
And time is running out.

01:19:35.563 --> 01:19:36.898
I won't help you.

01:19:37.565 --> 01:19:39.943
There are worse things
than forgetting.

01:19:40.568 --> 01:19:44.212
No, there aren't.

01:19:44.222 --> 01:19:47.867
You need to forget.

01:20:35.621 --> 01:20:38.416
You're different from the others.

01:20:39.125 --> 01:20:40.918
Why?

01:20:44.630 --> 01:20:46.622
It's better this way.

01:20:46.632 --> 01:20:48.926
You won't be haunted
by his memory.

01:20:49.135 --> 01:20:51.387
You could have a life again.

01:20:52.638 --> 01:20:58.102
Now, I want you to go back
to that first day in the hospital.

01:20:58.144 --> 01:21:02.774
To the first time you ever saw Sam.

01:21:10.156 --> 01:21:12.325
I need that first memory.

01:21:17.163 --> 01:21:20.249
Give me that first memory.

01:21:35.181 --> 01:21:38.642
That boy. What was his name?

01:21:42.688 --> 01:21:44.481
What boy?

01:22:17.722 --> 01:22:20.599
I had life inside of me.

01:22:24.228 --> 01:22:28.357
I had life.

01:22:31.736 --> 01:22:34.780
I have a child.

01:22:37.742 --> 01:22:40.494
I have a son.

01:22:41.746 --> 01:22:43.831
I...

01:22:44.248 --> 01:22:46.417
...have a son.

01:22:46.751 --> 01:22:51.756
His name is Sam,
you son of a bitch.

01:22:59.263 --> 01:23:01.057
I need more time.

01:23:27.290 --> 01:23:29.000
Sam!

01:23:33.296 --> 01:23:34.589
Sam!

01:23:46.809 --> 01:23:49.311
Sam! Sam!

01:23:52.314 --> 01:23:54.566
Sam Paretta, do you know him?

01:23:54.817 --> 01:23:56.610
Sam!

01:24:08.330 --> 01:24:10.332
Hey, Mom.

01:24:11.834 --> 01:24:13.502
It's not time to go yet, is it?

01:24:32.855 --> 01:24:34.857
Mom, I can't breathe.

01:24:37.860 --> 01:24:41.155
I'm sorry. I just...

01:24:41.864 --> 01:24:45.492
- I just wanted you to button up.
- Can I play till 5:30?

01:24:46.869 --> 01:24:48.203
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:24:48.370 --> 01:24:51.373
- Yeah, 5:30's okay.
- Okay. Thanks.

01:24:51.383 --> 01:24:52.791
See you.

01:24:54.376 --> 01:24:55.627
See you.

01:25:02.384 --> 01:25:05.220
Hi, Lauren.

01:25:28.909 --> 01:25:30.869
Hi.

01:25:30.911 --> 01:25:32.621
Hi.

01:25:37.918 --> 01:25:39.753
I guess they...

01:25:40.921 --> 01:25:44.257
- They don't want parents around.
- No.

01:25:48.929 --> 01:25:51.056
You keep watching him.

01:25:51.431 --> 01:25:53.392
It's hard not to.

01:25:55.435 --> 01:25:56.687
They're okay.

01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:02.025
I know.

01:26:04.945 --> 01:26:08.824
I'm Telly. Sam's mom.

01:26:09.950 --> 01:26:13.245
I'm Ash. I think we met before.
