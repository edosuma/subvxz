You were blue and purple

if you died, if they'd
still let me hold you.

11:38.732 --> 11:40.965
But they saved you.

Maybe a hospital is not
such a bad idea, Charlie.

get used to life in here.

36:28.020 --> 36:32.355
Because this is
exactly where you belong.

36:35.561 --> 36:36.660
No.

36:36.662 --> 36:39.296
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Please.

36:39.298 --> 36:40.197
No. Detective!

36:40.199 --> 36:42.465
Detective, please come back!

36:42.467 --> 36:43.833
Please.

36:43.835 --> 36:44.634
(LAUGHTER)

36:44.636 --> 36:47.470
Hey, sweet cheeks,
get a load of this.

36:50.542 --> 36:51.908
-What is wrong with you?
-(LAUGHS)

36:51.910 --> 36:53.376
CUTLER: You want to see
the before and after?

36:53.378 --> 36:55.312
We found him
all bloated and soggy.

36:55.314 --> 36:57.581
Oh, the stench was...pfft!

36:59.618 --> 37:00.750
SAM:
<i> I need you to go to a bar</i>

37:00.752 --> 37:04.554
<i> as a chatty, no apologies,</i>
<i> flaming homosexual.</i>

37:05.190 --> 37:08.558
-Chris.
-Ryan.

37:09.394 --> 37:10.760
I know this guy.

37:11.496 --> 37:13.396
Men doing that with men,

37:13.398 --> 37:15.498
they're just sick.

37:15.767 --> 37:17.534
You're back.

37:17.536 --> 37:18.902
Yeah.

37:19.905 --> 37:21.771
(LAUGHTER CONTINUES)

37:33.952 --> 37:35.685
(RETCHES)

37:43.795 --> 37:47.564

37:53.305 --> 37:55.538
KATHLEEN: I'm going now.

37:56.742 --> 37:58.575
(KATHLEEN SIGHS)

37:59.077 --> 38:01.344
But I got...

38:01.880 --> 38:04.681
One more thing for you.

38:14.226 --> 38:16.393
I've never done right by you.

38:16.928 --> 38:18.228
Ever.

38:18.297 --> 38:19.996
Not then.

38:20.265 --> 38:21.665
Not now.

38:24.369 --> 38:26.503
'Cause I don't know how.

38:28.840 --> 38:35.078
When they sent me off to jail,
you were so angry at me.

38:36.281 --> 38:40.750
(SNIFFLES) For leaving and...
For everything.

38:42.654 --> 38:44.688
And I was angry at you.

38:45.657 --> 38:47.791
I asked you
to give me a hug,

38:47.793 --> 38:50.427
'cause you wouldn't be
seeing me for a long time,

38:50.429 --> 38:51.761
and you wouldn't
even look at me

38:51.763 --> 38:54.030
and you cussed me out.

38:58.437 --> 39:00.437
But then...

39:01.840 --> 39:03.773
When I got out,

39:05.210 --> 39:08.445
I saw you
in the parking lot.

39:08.947 --> 39:11.147
And you ran.

39:14.319 --> 39:16.019
Into my arms.

39:19.925 --> 39:20.957
(CRIES)

39:20.959 --> 39:24.127
I've always had
these dark thoughts

39:24.663 --> 39:26.296
about myself.

39:26.298 --> 39:27.330
And whenever I do,

39:27.332 --> 39:30.233
that's what
I try to remember.

39:30.435 --> 39:34.137
That feeling of
holding you in my arms,

39:34.706 --> 39:37.707
knowing that you needed me

39:39.344 --> 39:41.978
as much as
I needed you.

39:59.564 --> 40:01.297
(SCREAMS)

40:01.433 --> 40:02.766
(GASPING)

40:02.768 --> 40:05.168
KATHLEEN: Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!

40:05.170 --> 40:07.437
Charlie! Charlie.

40:07.939 --> 40:08.438
(COUGHS)

40:08.440 --> 40:12.876
I don't need
anything from you!

40:13.812 --> 40:14.744
(CRYING)

40:14.746 --> 40:16.112
Not your money.

40:16.114 --> 40:17.647
Not your love.

40:17.649 --> 40:19.582
Nothing!

40:20.886 --> 40:23.553
You want to take a trip, mama?

40:23.555 --> 40:25.789
(WHIMPERING)

40:53.718 --> 40:55.819
CHARLIE: Oh, hey.

40:55.821 --> 40:57.754
That thing we been
talking about.

40:57.756 --> 40:59.856
You know, the new meat.

40:59.925 --> 41:01.825
I found it.

41:01.827 --> 41:03.426
In there.

41:03.428 --> 41:05.528
She's ready.

41:09.468 --> 41:11.100
Your...

41:15.173 --> 41:18.875
-Do what you want with her.
-(CHUCKLES)

41:21.513 --> 41:24.113
Make sure
everyone gets a turn.
