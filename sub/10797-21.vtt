WEBVTT

00:08.542 --> 00:11.834
All hands, this is the Captain.

00:11.834 --> 00:14.792
As you may know,

00:11.834 --> 00:14.792
a sun in the Delos System

00:14.792 --> 00:17.458
is undergoing large-scale

00:14.792 --> 00:17.458
magnetic field changes

00:17.458 --> 00:20.000
producing violent

00:17.458 --> 00:20.000
gigantic flares.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.667
Now, we shall be studying

00:20.000 --> 00:22.667
this star at close range.

00:22.667 --> 00:25.250
Even though we shall be running

00:22.667 --> 00:25.250
with full deflectors

00:25.250 --> 00:28.375
the closeness of

00:25.250 --> 00:28.375
this event and its severity

00:28.375 --> 00:30.458
will create problems.

00:30.458 --> 00:32.208
Intense

00:30.458 --> 00:32.208
magnetic fields

00:32.208 --> 00:35.166
have a disruptive effect

00:32.208 --> 00:35.166
on electrical systems.

00:35.166 --> 00:36.250
Therefore,

00:35.166 --> 00:36.250
we can expect

00:36.250 --> 00:37.834
communication interruptions

00:37.834 --> 00:40.125
as well as potential temporary

00:37.834 --> 00:40.125
loss of other systems.

00:40.125 --> 00:42.583
As a precaution, we are

00:40.125 --> 00:42.583
now going to yellow alert.

00:42.583 --> 00:45.125
Stay sharp, everyone.

00:45.125 --> 00:46.583
COMPUTER:

00:45.125 --> 00:46.583
Attention all decks.

00:46.583 --> 00:47.875
Yellow alert.

00:49.500 --> 00:52.208
Engineering, this is

00:49.500 --> 00:52.208
Lieutenant Commander Data.

00:52.208 --> 00:53.500
Bring all systems on-line

00:53.500 --> 00:56.417
and direct full power

00:53.500 --> 00:56.417
to the shields.

00:56.417 --> 00:57.875
All sections secure, sir.

00:57.875 --> 00:59.041
Lieutenant La Forge?

00:59.041 --> 01:00.166
Course is set, Captain.

01:00.166 --> 01:01.250
Half impulse.

01:01.250 --> 01:03.208
Aye, sir,

01:01.250 --> 01:03.208
one half impulse.

01:03.208 --> 01:04.667
On main viewer.

01:08.500 --> 01:10.291
Mask out the photosphere.

01:15.750 --> 01:19.792
Magnify quadrant zero-seven

01:19.792 --> 01:22.625
magnification

01:19.792 --> 01:22.625
factor 12.

01:33.250 --> 01:35.959
I've never seen anything

01:33.250 --> 01:35.959
like this before.

01:35.959 --> 01:39.417
The violence of those

01:35.959 --> 01:39.417
eruptions is awesome.

01:39.417 --> 01:41.417
Captain, I'm reading

01:39.417 --> 01:41.417
an unusual number

01:41.417 --> 01:44.709
of sunspots

01:41.417 --> 01:44.709
and eruptive prominences, sir.

01:44.709 --> 01:47.041
The magnetic field

01:44.709 --> 01:47.041
is extremely...

01:47.041 --> 01:48.583
irregular.

01:55.166 --> 01:58.417
Captain, deflectors are being

01:55.166 --> 01:58.417
hit by huge bursts of X rays.

02:00.458 --> 02:02.166
Wow.

02:06.208 --> 02:07.625
Look.

02:10.166 --> 02:12.667
Captain, my console seems

02:10.166 --> 02:12.667
to be overloading.

02:12.667 --> 02:15.792
The X ray burst

02:12.667 --> 02:15.792
is disrupting systems, Captain.

02:15.792 --> 02:17.208
I'm adjusting

02:15.792 --> 02:17.208
deflectors

02:17.208 --> 02:19.542
to compensate.

02:19.542 --> 02:22.500
WORF:

02:19.542 --> 02:22.500
Engineering, increase power

02:19.542 --> 02:22.500
to forward shields.

02:22.500 --> 02:24.500
Forward deflectors on line, sir.

02:32.291 --> 02:33.959
Status report.

02:33.959 --> 02:36.125
All systems operational, sir.

02:36.125 --> 02:40.166
Captain, the level

02:36.125 --> 02:40.166
of tension on the

02:36.125 --> 02:40.166
ship is mounting.

02:43.041 --> 02:45.542
Understandable.

02:45.542 --> 02:47.375
Mr. Data?

02:47.375 --> 02:50.834
If we are to investigate, sir,

02:47.375 --> 02:50.834
we must get closer.

02:50.834 --> 02:53.542
Mr. La Forge...

02:53.542 --> 02:54.792
move us in closer.

02:54.792 --> 02:56.125
Aye, sir.

02:57.291 --> 02:58.834
This is the Captain.

02:58.834 --> 03:01.208
We will be pushing the

02:58.834 --> 03:01.208
shields to the limit

03:01.208 --> 03:05.208
but we are getting

03:01.208 --> 03:05.208
a splendid view

03:01.208 --> 03:05.208
of this phenomenon.

03:05.208 --> 03:10.083
Captain, I've intercepted what

03:05.208 --> 03:10.083
appears to be a distress signal.

03:10.083 --> 03:11.166
Let me hear it.

03:11.166 --> 03:13.625
(<i> static</i> )

03:13.625 --> 03:15.166
This is T'Jon.

03:15.166 --> 03:17.542
I am on the Ornaran freighter

03:15.166 --> 03:17.542
<i>Sanction.</i>

03:17.542 --> 03:19.959
We have a serious problem here

03:17.542 --> 03:19.959
and can't seem to fix it.

03:19.959 --> 03:21.291
(<i> static</i> )

03:21.291 --> 03:23.125
We need help.

03:23.125 --> 03:26.417
The transmission is coming

03:23.125 --> 03:26.417
from a freighter in orbit

03:26.417 --> 03:28.750
around the fourth planet

03:26.417 --> 03:28.750
in the system.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.333
However, the receiving station

03:30.333 --> 03:32.583
is on the third

03:30.333 --> 03:32.583
planet.

03:32.583 --> 03:34.041
Open hailing frequencies.

03:34.041 --> 03:35.875
Hailing

03:34.041 --> 03:35.875
frequencies open.

03:35.875 --> 03:40.375
Unidentified freighter,

03:35.875 --> 03:40.375
this is the USS<i> Enterprise.</i>

03:40.375 --> 03:43.166
May we be of assistance?

03:43.166 --> 03:44.542
Whoever you are, yes.

03:44.542 --> 03:46.709
I'm having trouble navigating.

03:46.709 --> 03:48.917
Can't maintain a steady course.

03:48.917 --> 03:51.834
Please help us if you can.

03:51.834 --> 03:53.291
Can't you enhance the frequency?

03:53.291 --> 03:55.917
Too much interference.

03:55.917 --> 03:58.250
Set course to intersect with

03:55.917 --> 03:58.250
the freighter-- warp two.

03:58.250 --> 03:59.417
LA FORGE:

03:58.250 --> 03:59.417
Aye, sir.

03:59.417 --> 04:01.166
Maintain yellow alert.

04:01.166 --> 04:02.792
I can't control the helm

04:01.166 --> 04:02.792
any longer.

04:02.792 --> 04:04.750
Our ship is losing orbit.

04:04.750 --> 04:06.500
We're heading

04:04.750 --> 04:06.500
into the atmosphere.

04:06.500 --> 04:07.750
Please do something.

04:07.750 --> 04:09.291
We're going to burn up!

04:09.291 --> 04:10.625
We haven't much time.

04:31.166 --> 04:35.834
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

04:35.834 --> 04:40.333
<i>These are the voyages</i>

04:35.834 --> 04:40.333

06:04.875 --> 06:08.041
It is a freighter-- very old.

06:08.041 --> 06:10.834
Captain, our sensors are

06:08.041 --> 06:10.834
being severely affected

06:10.834 --> 06:12.750
by the sun flares.

06:12.750 --> 06:14.333
Helm, take us in

06:12.750 --> 06:14.333
as close as possible

06:14.333 --> 06:15.542
to the freighter's orbit.

06:15.542 --> 06:17.000
Moving in, sir.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.959
There are six life-forms

06:17.000 --> 06:18.959
aboard the freighter, sir.

06:18.959 --> 06:21.792
Captain, the freighter's orbit

06:18.959 --> 06:21.792
is decaying.

06:21.792 --> 06:24.500
How long before

06:21.792 --> 06:24.500
it loses integrity?

06:24.500 --> 06:26.542
A matter of minutes.

06:26.542 --> 06:30.583
Unidentified freighter,

06:26.542 --> 06:30.583
this is the USS<i> Enterprise.</i>

06:30.583 --> 06:32.083
T'JON:

06:30.583 --> 06:32.083
<i>Enterprise</i>

06:32.083 --> 06:34.709
this is the Ornaran

06:32.083 --> 06:34.709

06:34.709 --> 06:36.333
Put this on the main viewer.

06:37.417 --> 06:40.917
(<i> static</i> )

06:40.917 --> 06:42.667
The visual transmission

06:40.917 --> 06:42.667
is still breaking up.

06:49.125 --> 06:51.667
Freighter<i> Sanction,</i>

06:49.125 --> 06:51.667
this is the<i> Enterprise.</i>

06:51.667 --> 06:53.792
What is your situation?

06:53.792 --> 06:55.834
Oh, not so good.

06:55.834 --> 06:57.375
The helm isn't working right.

06:57.375 --> 07:01.208
(<i> many voices speaking at once)</i>

07:01.208 --> 07:02.458
This is the<i> Enterprise.</i>

07:02.458 --> 07:03.959
With all this interference

07:03.959 --> 07:06.500
it is difficult to copy

07:03.959 --> 07:06.500
your transmission.

07:06.500 --> 07:09.166
If you all talk at once,

07:06.500 --> 07:09.166
it is almost impossible.

07:09.166 --> 07:15.000
Now, please, say again

07:09.166 --> 07:15.000
what is your situation?

07:15.000 --> 07:19.250
I am T'Jon,

07:15.000 --> 07:19.250
Captain of the<i> Sanction.</i>

07:19.250 --> 07:21.458
At last.

07:21.458 --> 07:23.333
How can we help?

07:23.333 --> 07:27.250
We have lost...

07:23.333 --> 07:27.250
I don't know, something.

07:27.250 --> 07:29.875
I am no longer able

07:27.250 --> 07:29.875
to maintain this orbit

07:29.875 --> 07:33.250
nor am I able

07:29.875 --> 07:33.250
to use the main thrusters.

07:33.250 --> 07:36.333
It's all, you know,

07:33.250 --> 07:36.333
dead I guess.

07:36.333 --> 07:40.709
It's all... shut down.

07:40.709 --> 07:43.291
Well, that is

07:40.709 --> 07:43.291
a little vague.

07:43.291 --> 07:45.375
What is the computer

07:43.291 --> 07:45.375
analysis?

07:45.375 --> 07:50.083
Well, the computer's

07:45.375 --> 07:50.083
not working very well.

07:50.083 --> 07:51.750
Data, can you tap

07:50.083 --> 07:51.750
into their computer

07:51.750 --> 07:54.000
and clarify

07:51.750 --> 07:54.000
the situation?

07:54.000 --> 07:55.834
I will attempt it, sir.

07:55.834 --> 08:00.083
Captain, the tractor beam is

07:55.834 --> 08:00.083
available, if you want it.

08:00.083 --> 08:01.417
At least, we can pull them

08:00.083 --> 08:01.417
out of orbit

08:01.417 --> 08:03.959
before they enter

08:01.417 --> 08:03.959
the atmosphere.

08:03.959 --> 08:05.959
Freighter, we're going to

08:03.959 --> 08:05.959
lock on the tractor beam

08:05.959 --> 08:08.291
and pull you

08:05.959 --> 08:08.291
out of orbit.

08:08.291 --> 08:09.792
Hey, that's great.

08:14.291 --> 08:17.917
(<i> beam trying to power up</i> )

08:19.625 --> 08:23.417
Captain, the freighter's orbit

08:19.625 --> 08:23.417
continues to deteriorate.

08:23.417 --> 08:25.542
The solar flares are interfering

08:23.417 --> 08:25.542
with the tractor beam, Captain.

08:25.542 --> 08:27.500
I can't lock on.

08:27.500 --> 08:29.750
Captain T'Jon, we are unable

08:27.500 --> 08:29.750
to attach the tractor beam

08:29.750 --> 08:32.083
because of the intense

08:29.750 --> 08:32.083
solar activity.

08:32.083 --> 08:33.625
I understand.

08:33.625 --> 08:35.375
Thanks for trying.

08:35.375 --> 08:38.583
Sir, I have determined what is

08:35.375 --> 08:38.583
malfunctioning on the freighter.

08:38.583 --> 08:40.333
Captain, we

08:38.583 --> 08:40.333
have analyzed

08:38.583 --> 08:40.333
your problem.

08:40.333 --> 08:41.333
Great.

08:41.333 --> 08:42.792
Data.

08:42.792 --> 08:44.709
Your ship's design uses

08:42.792 --> 08:44.709
an electromagnetic coil

08:44.709 --> 08:46.625
to constrict the exhaust flow.

08:46.625 --> 08:48.333
That coil is misaligned.

08:48.333 --> 08:49.875
Really?

08:49.875 --> 08:52.250
Do you have the necessary

08:49.875 --> 08:52.250
tools to realign the coil?

08:52.250 --> 08:53.709
I don't think so.

08:53.709 --> 08:54.959
I believe, Captain,

08:53.709 --> 08:54.959
we can provide them

08:54.959 --> 08:56.083
with a temporary substitute.

08:56.083 --> 08:57.166
Our ship's stores contain

08:57.166 --> 08:59.333
a coil of the proper type.

08:59.333 --> 09:00.333
Can we beam one over?

09:00.333 --> 09:01.709
Yes.

09:01.709 --> 09:04.166
Captain, we are beaming over

09:01.709 --> 09:04.166
a replacement coil.

09:04.166 --> 09:06.041
That's great.

09:06.041 --> 09:08.333
And that will fix us up?

09:08.333 --> 09:10.291
Yes, once it's installed.

09:10.291 --> 09:11.667
Right.

09:12.750 --> 09:16.917
And how do we do that?

09:16.917 --> 09:18.917
What is the matter

09:16.917 --> 09:18.917
with these people?

09:18.917 --> 09:20.333
How can he be captain

09:18.917 --> 09:20.333
of that vessel

09:20.333 --> 09:21.458
and not understand

09:21.458 --> 09:23.333
its simplest

09:21.458 --> 09:23.333
function?

09:23.333 --> 09:24.625
Captain, how long

09:23.333 --> 09:24.625
have you been

09:24.625 --> 09:25.917
in command of

09:24.625 --> 09:25.917
this freighter?

09:25.917 --> 09:27.375
Seven years.

09:27.375 --> 09:30.834
This is my 26th voyage

09:27.375 --> 09:30.834
to Brekka.

09:30.834 --> 09:33.417
And you don't know how

09:30.834 --> 09:33.417
to align a control coil?

09:33.417 --> 09:35.750
It's never come up.

09:35.750 --> 09:37.625
Can anyone else

09:35.750 --> 09:37.625
over there do it?

09:37.625 --> 09:39.250
Hold on. I'll ask.

09:45.208 --> 09:49.458
Sorry, nobody here

09:45.208 --> 09:49.458
knows anything about it.

09:49.458 --> 09:50.750
I'd better get over there

09:49.458 --> 09:50.750
with a team.

09:50.750 --> 09:52.375
Captain,

09:50.750 --> 09:52.375
I strongly

09:52.375 --> 09:54.417
recommend against anyone

09:52.375 --> 09:54.417
from the ship beaming over.

09:54.417 --> 09:56.583
The solar interference

09:54.417 --> 09:56.583
is too great.

09:56.583 --> 09:58.750
WORF:

09:56.583 --> 09:58.750
The freighter has entered

09:56.583 --> 09:58.750
the planet's atmosphere.

09:58.750 --> 10:00.834
Disintegration is imminent.

10:00.834 --> 10:02.291
We're running out

10:00.834 --> 10:02.291
of options.

10:02.291 --> 10:04.500
Let's get them off there.

10:04.500 --> 10:06.792
T'Jon, stand by to beam over.

10:06.792 --> 10:08.959
If you think that's best.

10:08.959 --> 10:10.834
Unless you have

10:08.959 --> 10:10.834
any other options

10:10.834 --> 10:13.500
yes, I think that's best.

10:13.500 --> 10:14.917
Whatever you say.

10:25.709 --> 10:29.583
I can't maintain

10:25.709 --> 10:29.583
a positive lock.

10:29.583 --> 10:31.000
Unusual E.M. burst, sir.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.834
Readings off scale.

10:32.834 --> 10:34.959
Freighter<i> Sanction,</i>

10:32.834 --> 10:34.959
this is the<i> Enterprise.</i>

10:34.959 --> 10:36.333
We're having difficulty

10:34.959 --> 10:36.333
getting a fix.

10:36.333 --> 10:37.959
Have them go

10:36.333 --> 10:37.959
to their own transporter room.

10:37.959 --> 10:39.250
It will be tricky

10:37.959 --> 10:39.250
but perhaps I can link

10:39.250 --> 10:40.750
the two transporters

10:39.250 --> 10:40.750
in series

10:40.750 --> 10:42.959
and get them over

10:40.750 --> 10:42.959
with the increased power.

10:42.959 --> 10:44.375
That's worth a try.

10:44.375 --> 10:46.917
Captain T'Jon, go

10:44.375 --> 10:46.917
to your transporter room.

10:46.917 --> 10:48.291
Contact me from there.

10:48.291 --> 10:49.750
Right,<i> Enterprise.</i>

10:49.750 --> 10:51.375
It's right next door

10:51.375 --> 10:52.333
but, if you can't get us

10:52.333 --> 10:53.709
with your transporter

10:53.709 --> 10:56.000
what makes you think

10:53.709 --> 10:56.000
ours will do the job?

10:56.000 --> 10:57.625
I'm going to interconnect them.

10:57.625 --> 10:58.917
I didn't know you could do that.

10:58.917 --> 11:00.917
Hurry!

10:58.917 --> 11:00.917
We're running out of time.

11:00.917 --> 11:02.250
We're on our way.

11:02.250 --> 11:04.125
I don't think

11:02.250 --> 11:04.125
they're going to make it.

11:04.125 --> 11:05.333
Captain T'Jon doesn't

11:04.125 --> 11:05.333
sound like he cares

11:05.333 --> 11:06.875
one way

11:05.333 --> 11:06.875
or the other.

11:06.875 --> 11:08.125
(<i> beeping</i> )

11:06.875 --> 11:08.125
Worf, how much time do we have?

11:08.125 --> 11:09.792
WORF:

11:08.125 --> 11:09.792
One minute, 28 seconds.

11:09.792 --> 11:11.250
Captain T'Jon, are you there?

11:11.250 --> 11:12.667
We're in the transporter room.

11:12.667 --> 11:14.083
Great, activate

11:12.667 --> 11:14.083
your transporter.

11:14.083 --> 11:16.083
Set coordinates

11:14.083 --> 11:16.083
nine-seven-zero-three

11:16.083 --> 11:17.625
mark two-six-eight.

11:17.625 --> 11:21.458
Did you say two-eight-six

11:17.625 --> 11:21.458
or eight-eight-six?

11:21.458 --> 11:23.583
Mark<i> two-six-eight.</i>

11:23.583 --> 11:25.166
Got it.

11:25.166 --> 11:26.709
Sir, the hull temperature

11:25.166 --> 11:26.709
of the freighter

11:26.709 --> 11:29.166
is passing

11:26.709 --> 11:29.166
3,000 degrees.

11:29.166 --> 11:30.667
What's the holdup,

11:29.166 --> 11:30.667
Number One?

11:30.667 --> 11:33.041
We're establishing

11:30.667 --> 11:33.041
the link right now.

11:33.041 --> 11:34.542
We're ready.

11:34.542 --> 11:36.709
Then all six of you get

11:34.542 --> 11:36.709
on the transporter platform.

11:36.709 --> 11:38.792
On my signal, energize.

11:38.792 --> 11:40.458
I've got their initial

11:38.792 --> 11:40.458
transporter signal

11:40.458 --> 11:41.834
interlock complete.

11:41.834 --> 11:43.000
Energize on my mark.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.834
Four, three, two,

11:43.000 --> 11:46.834
one... energize.

12:03.458 --> 12:06.375
PICARD:

12:03.458 --> 12:06.375
Number One,

12:03.458 --> 12:06.375
did you get them off?

12:06.375 --> 12:08.208
No, sir, they stayed

12:06.375 --> 12:08.208
on the freighter

12:08.208 --> 12:10.500
but they beamed over

12:08.208 --> 12:10.500
their cargo.

12:10.500 --> 12:13.166
Cargo?

12:13.166 --> 12:14.417
Are those people crazy?

12:14.417 --> 12:16.792
What could possibly

12:14.417 --> 12:16.792
be so important?

12:16.792 --> 12:19.041
Sir, the freighter

12:16.792 --> 12:19.041
is disintegrating.

12:29.792 --> 12:31.917
Their lives are in danger

12:29.792 --> 12:31.917
and they're beaming over cargo?

12:31.917 --> 12:33.875
Number One, I don't understand

12:31.917 --> 12:33.875
these people.

12:33.875 --> 12:35.625
Captain, freighter's

12:33.875 --> 12:35.625
hull temperature

12:35.625 --> 12:37.375
is approaching critical.

12:37.375 --> 12:38.917
Unbelievable.

12:38.917 --> 12:40.291
PICARD:

12:38.917 --> 12:40.291
We're losing the freighter.

12:40.291 --> 12:42.166
We've got to beam

12:40.291 --> 12:42.166
those people over now.

12:42.166 --> 12:43.458
Clear the cargo,

12:42.166 --> 12:43.458
beam it to a hold.

12:43.458 --> 12:44.709
Aye, sir.

12:49.583 --> 12:51.250
RIKER:

12:49.583 --> 12:51.250
Freighter<i> Sanction,</i>

12:49.583 --> 12:51.250
this is the<i> Enterprise</i>

12:51.250 --> 12:52.917
get to your transporter...

12:51.250 --> 12:52.917
No, forget about that.

12:52.917 --> 12:54.166
Lock onto any life-form

12:52.917 --> 12:54.166
you can find

12:54.166 --> 12:55.500
and get them

12:54.166 --> 12:55.500
over here now.

12:55.500 --> 12:56.917
Trying, sir.

12:56.917 --> 12:58.959
The freighter is going down.

12:58.959 --> 13:01.083
Transporter room,

12:58.959 --> 13:01.083
you're out of time.

13:01.083 --> 13:03.500
Reading six life-forms,

13:01.083 --> 13:03.500
but I can't get a solid lock.

13:03.500 --> 13:04.542
We have no choice.

13:04.542 --> 13:05.875
Energize.

13:11.250 --> 13:12.625
I thought you said

13:11.250 --> 13:12.625
there were six.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.125
Where are the other two?

13:12.625 --> 13:14.125
The lock didn't hold.

13:14.125 --> 13:17.291
Reestablish.

13:14.125 --> 13:17.291
It's too late.

13:21.500 --> 13:22.917
Number One?

13:26.125 --> 13:28.333
Two are lost, sir

13:28.333 --> 13:31.375
but we saved four.

13:31.375 --> 13:35.291
I'm Commander William Riker

13:31.375 --> 13:35.291
of the USS<i> Enterprise.</i>

13:35.291 --> 13:37.875
I'm sorry we were unable

13:35.291 --> 13:37.875
to rescue the other two.

13:37.875 --> 13:40.375
We did everything we could.

13:40.375 --> 13:42.542
If you had come instead

13:40.375 --> 13:42.542
of sending your cargo

13:42.542 --> 13:44.083
you all would

13:42.542 --> 13:44.083
have made it.

13:44.083 --> 13:46.458
The cargo-- where is it?

13:46.458 --> 13:48.208
You did save it, didn't you?

13:48.208 --> 13:49.250
Yes, we did.

13:49.250 --> 13:52.583
It's in one of our cargo holds.

13:52.583 --> 13:53.834
You act as if

13:52.583 --> 13:53.834
it's more important

13:53.834 --> 13:55.500
than your comrades.

13:55.500 --> 13:58.625
The cargo--

13:55.500 --> 13:58.625
may we see it?

14:01.583 --> 14:02.959
Follow me.

14:11.083 --> 14:12.333
Thank you. Thank you.

14:12.333 --> 14:13.875
We thought we had lost it.

14:13.875 --> 14:16.041
Careful with your

14:13.875 --> 14:16.041
choice of words, T'Jon.

14:16.041 --> 14:18.291
It's ours, not yours.

14:18.291 --> 14:20.542
We paid a fair

14:18.291 --> 14:20.542
price for it.

14:20.542 --> 14:23.500
You offered a fair price.

14:20.542 --> 14:23.500
We have not received it.

14:23.500 --> 14:26.125
You accepted our

14:23.500 --> 14:26.125
goods in trade.

14:26.125 --> 14:28.583
Then where are they, hmm?

14:28.583 --> 14:30.000
Tell me.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.208
That's not our problem.

14:32.208 --> 14:34.959
No more than the barrel

14:32.208 --> 14:34.959
is your property.

14:34.959 --> 14:36.250
It's as simple as this--

14:36.250 --> 14:38.208
the goods were

14:36.250 --> 14:38.208
never delivered.

14:38.208 --> 14:39.667
They were destroyed

14:38.208 --> 14:39.667
with your ship.

14:39.667 --> 14:41.250
Hence the deal

14:39.667 --> 14:41.250
was incomplete

14:41.250 --> 14:43.959
hence possession of

14:41.250 --> 14:43.959
the felicium remains ours.

14:43.959 --> 14:45.875
We need it.

14:45.875 --> 14:47.875
Commander, I request

14:45.875 --> 14:47.875
you transport

14:47.875 --> 14:51.125
my associate and myself

14:47.875 --> 14:51.125
down to Brekka

14:51.125 --> 14:52.542
with our

14:51.125 --> 14:52.542
merchandise.

14:52.542 --> 14:53.625
T'JON:

14:52.542 --> 14:53.625
Yes!

14:53.625 --> 14:55.333
Get them out of here.

14:55.333 --> 14:57.834
But the barrel stays.

14:57.834 --> 14:59.583
There's no

14:57.834 --> 14:59.583
reasoning with you.

14:59.583 --> 15:02.875
Langor, you expect

14:59.583 --> 15:02.875
too much from them.

15:02.875 --> 15:04.083
You always have

15:04.083 --> 15:07.125
and you've always

15:04.083 --> 15:07.125
been disappointed.

15:07.125 --> 15:09.083
You didn't pay for it.

15:09.083 --> 15:10.667
Therefore,

15:09.083 --> 15:10.667
it's not yours.

15:10.667 --> 15:13.542
Damn you, Sobi.

15:13.542 --> 15:14.458
Ah!

15:14.458 --> 15:16.583
(<i> grunting</i> )

15:23.875 --> 15:25.125
Stop this.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.500
Now!

15:26.500 --> 15:28.583
RIKER:

15:26.500 --> 15:28.583
Security

15:26.500 --> 15:28.583
to Cargo Bay 11.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.542
Behave yourselves,

15:34.000 --> 15:36.542
gentlemen.

15:48.667 --> 15:51.917
Escort our visitors

15:48.667 --> 15:51.917
to the observation lounge.

16:02.083 --> 16:04.375
A natural

16:02.083 --> 16:04.375
electrical charge?

16:04.375 --> 16:05.667
Formidable.

16:05.667 --> 16:08.208
Yes, and a difficult

16:05.667 --> 16:08.208
weapon to confiscate.

16:12.500 --> 16:14.333
I have never

16:12.500 --> 16:14.333
seen humanoids

16:12.500 --> 16:14.333
with that power.

16:14.333 --> 16:15.333
Neither have I.

16:15.333 --> 16:16.875
I wonder

16:15.333 --> 16:16.875
how it evolved.

16:16.875 --> 16:18.000
I wonder if the strong magnetic

16:16.875 --> 16:18.000
field of their sun

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
might have something

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
to do with it.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.500
Could be.

16:20.500 --> 16:22.125
I wonder how much power

16:20.500 --> 16:22.125
our guests can produce.

16:22.125 --> 16:23.750
Or if they need

16:22.125 --> 16:23.750
to recharge.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.125
It's an interesting

16:23.750 --> 16:25.125
ability.

16:25.125 --> 16:26.750
The question is,

16:25.125 --> 16:26.750
how do I defend

16:25.125 --> 16:26.750
against it?

16:26.750 --> 16:28.375
Do you think our visitors

16:26.750 --> 16:28.375
pose a threat?

16:28.375 --> 16:30.750
I don't know, but if

16:28.375 --> 16:30.750
they do, I'd better

16:28.375 --> 16:30.750
be ready for it.

16:30.750 --> 16:32.125
Precisely, Lieutenant.

16:41.875 --> 16:43.166
We have to resolve

16:41.875 --> 16:43.166
this soon.

16:43.166 --> 16:45.291
There isn't much time.

16:45.291 --> 16:46.834
What can you offer?

16:46.834 --> 16:49.834
Everything we had

16:46.834 --> 16:49.834
went down with

16:46.834 --> 16:49.834
the<i> Sanction.</i>

16:49.834 --> 16:53.542
Then it's going

16:49.834 --> 16:53.542
to be difficult

16:49.834 --> 16:53.542
to accommodate you.

16:53.542 --> 16:55.583
Solar flares increasing

16:53.542 --> 16:55.583
in magnitude, Captain.

16:55.583 --> 16:58.083
Shields are shaky,

16:55.583 --> 16:58.083
but they're holding.

16:58.083 --> 16:59.333
Maintain.

17:02.500 --> 17:04.625
How are our rather

17:02.500 --> 17:04.625
quarrelsome guests?

17:04.625 --> 17:07.500
They're waiting for you

17:04.625 --> 17:07.500
in the observation lounge, sir.

17:07.500 --> 17:08.834
Data, what information

17:07.500 --> 17:08.834
can you give us

17:08.834 --> 17:10.625
about the inhabitants

17:08.834 --> 17:10.625
of this system?

17:10.625 --> 17:12.166
Not very much, sir.

17:12.166 --> 17:14.166
The only recorded contact

17:12.166 --> 17:14.166
with the Delos system

17:14.166 --> 17:15.917
was over 200 years ago.

17:15.917 --> 17:18.458
A scout ship reported

17:15.917 --> 17:18.458
two inhabited planets--

17:18.458 --> 17:21.208
one of which was on the verge

17:18.458 --> 17:21.208
of acquiring space travel.

17:21.208 --> 17:23.041
Ah, then, in two centuries,

17:21.208 --> 17:23.041
neither civilization

17:23.041 --> 17:24.792
advanced much further.

17:24.792 --> 17:28.000
Sir, I find it strange

17:24.792 --> 17:28.000
that none of our visitors

17:28.000 --> 17:29.417
feels much remorse

17:29.417 --> 17:31.792
about the two freighter

17:29.417 --> 17:31.792
passengers who perished.

17:31.792 --> 17:33.291
Yet that barrel of cargo

17:33.291 --> 17:35.500
is a source of great

17:33.291 --> 17:35.500
anxiety to them.

17:35.500 --> 17:38.375
Mm-hmm, yes, let's pay a call,

17:35.500 --> 17:38.375
get some answers.

17:38.375 --> 17:39.709
Number One, Mr. Data.

17:39.709 --> 17:41.250
Mr. La Forge,

17:39.709 --> 17:41.250
you have the bridge.

17:41.250 --> 17:42.583
Aye, sir.

17:50.208 --> 17:53.458
Captain, may I present Sobi and

17:50.208 --> 17:53.458
Langor from the planet Brekka

17:53.458 --> 17:56.333
and T'Jon and Romas

17:53.458 --> 17:56.333
from Ornara.

17:56.333 --> 17:58.291
I'm sorry we couldn't

17:56.333 --> 17:58.291
save your ship.

17:58.291 --> 18:00.792
Tell me, you could

17:58.291 --> 18:00.792
have repaired it?

18:00.792 --> 18:04.750
PICARD:

18:00.792 --> 18:04.750
Oh, yes.

18:04.750 --> 18:07.542
We have only two left,

18:04.750 --> 18:07.542
and neither works properly.

18:07.542 --> 18:09.500
They are critical

18:07.542 --> 18:09.500
to our survival.

18:09.500 --> 18:11.000
Will you fix them?

18:11.000 --> 18:12.458
Mr. Data?

18:12.458 --> 18:14.417
Our computer has downloaded

18:12.458 --> 18:14.417
the specifications

18:14.417 --> 18:17.500
for the magnetic coils

18:14.417 --> 18:17.500
the freighters depend on.

18:17.500 --> 18:19.041
Assuming the malfunction

18:17.500 --> 18:19.041
is similar

18:19.041 --> 18:20.166
suitable

18:19.041 --> 18:20.166
replacements

18:20.166 --> 18:24.000
can be

18:20.166 --> 18:24.000
fabricated.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.667
Instruct Engineering

18:24.000 --> 18:25.667
to proceed.

18:25.667 --> 18:26.875
DATA:

18:25.667 --> 18:26.875
Aye, sir.

18:29.125 --> 18:31.041
Now, as for our cargo...

18:31.041 --> 18:32.959
<i>Our</i> cargo, Captain.

18:32.959 --> 18:34.834
Wrong, Sobi.

18:34.834 --> 18:37.500
My First Officer has said

18:34.834 --> 18:37.500
that ownership of this cargo

18:37.500 --> 18:40.208
is in dispute,

18:37.500 --> 18:40.208
but this question

18:37.500 --> 18:40.208
must be settled

18:40.208 --> 18:42.500
by whatever legal machinery

18:42.500 --> 18:44.583
exists

18:42.500 --> 18:44.583
between your two societies.

18:44.583 --> 18:46.083
Captain, you

18:44.583 --> 18:46.083
don't understand.

18:46.083 --> 18:48.417
This is a matter

18:46.083 --> 18:48.417
of life and death.

18:48.417 --> 18:49.458
Why is that?

18:49.458 --> 18:50.917
What is this cargo?

18:52.834 --> 18:54.583
Medicine.

18:56.625 --> 18:57.875
Indeed.

18:57.875 --> 19:00.125
Our planet is

18:57.875 --> 19:00.125
in desperate need, Captain.

19:00.125 --> 19:03.625
We have people suffering

19:00.125 --> 19:03.625
from a lethal plague.

19:03.625 --> 19:05.125
T'JON:

19:03.625 --> 19:05.125
The cargo

19:03.625 --> 19:05.125
you have impounded

19:05.125 --> 19:06.917
is the only hope

19:05.125 --> 19:06.917
of life for our people.

19:09.667 --> 19:11.417
Is that so?

19:11.417 --> 19:12.834
Yes.

19:12.834 --> 19:14.667
You must think us

19:12.834 --> 19:14.667
heartless brutes, Captain

19:14.667 --> 19:16.375
but look at

19:14.667 --> 19:16.375
our side of it.

19:16.375 --> 19:19.041
The plant which yields

19:16.375 --> 19:19.041
the medicine felicium

19:19.041 --> 19:21.792
grows only in remote

19:19.041 --> 19:21.792
areas of Brekka.

19:21.792 --> 19:24.792
It must be painstakingly

19:21.792 --> 19:24.792
cultivated, harvested

19:24.792 --> 19:29.083
purified-- a complex

19:24.792 --> 19:29.083
and expensive process.

19:29.083 --> 19:30.917
That single shipment

19:29.083 --> 19:30.917
of felicium

19:30.917 --> 19:33.458
represents an

19:30.917 --> 19:33.458
enormous investment.

19:33.458 --> 19:35.875
We can't just

19:33.458 --> 19:35.875
give it away.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.000
We paid for it.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.083
We ask for only what is ours.

19:39.083 --> 19:41.291
That is

19:39.083 --> 19:41.291
your viewpoint.

19:41.291 --> 19:43.917
Ours, of course, differs.

19:43.917 --> 19:46.375
You are going to hold

19:43.917 --> 19:46.375
to that position?

19:46.375 --> 19:50.583
I am constrained to abide

19:46.375 --> 19:50.583
by the terms of our agreement.

19:50.583 --> 19:51.875
Then you condemn

19:50.583 --> 19:51.875
us to death!

19:51.875 --> 19:53.000
Romas...

19:53.000 --> 19:54.458
You disgust me!

19:54.458 --> 19:57.333
If you could see the suffering

19:54.458 --> 19:57.333
the plague has caused.

20:03.625 --> 20:07.709
Well, you are going to

20:07.709 --> 20:09.792
when you see

20:07.709 --> 20:09.792
what it does to us.

20:14.375 --> 20:18.667
Romas, are you and T'Jon

20:14.375 --> 20:18.667
carrying this plague?

20:22.166 --> 20:23.834
Yes.

20:28.208 --> 20:31.083
Every Ornaran does.

20:31.083 --> 20:34.291
Then you may have

20:31.083 --> 20:34.291
brought it aboard this ship.

20:34.291 --> 20:36.458
Was there a medical scan

20:34.291 --> 20:36.458
when they transported?

20:36.458 --> 20:37.959
Unverified.

20:37.959 --> 20:39.166
The solar flares could have

20:37.959 --> 20:39.166
caused a malfunction

20:39.166 --> 20:40.458
in the biofilter.

20:40.458 --> 20:42.834
(<i> sighing</i> )

20:42.834 --> 20:44.000
Med alert.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.250
Medical emergency--

20:44.000 --> 20:45.250
Dr. Crusher

20:45.250 --> 20:47.250
to the observation

20:45.250 --> 20:47.250
lounge at once.

20:56.166 --> 20:58.208
You find us well,

20:56.166 --> 20:58.208
I trust.

20:58.208 --> 21:00.834
As far as I can tell.

21:00.834 --> 21:02.709
Your physiology

21:00.834 --> 21:02.709
is somewhat different

21:02.709 --> 21:04.417
than I've ever encountered

21:04.417 --> 21:08.000
but I detect no dangerous

21:04.417 --> 21:08.000
virus or bacteria.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.125
I assure you we're

21:08.000 --> 21:10.125
in perfect health.

21:10.125 --> 21:11.417
But we

21:10.125 --> 21:11.417
are not.

21:11.417 --> 21:12.917
We need

21:11.417 --> 21:12.917
our medicine.

21:12.917 --> 21:14.208
<i>Our</i> medicine.

21:14.208 --> 21:15.917
We paid for it,

21:14.208 --> 21:15.917
it's ours now.

21:15.917 --> 21:18.166
Enough.

21:18.166 --> 21:19.333
Of course.

21:19.333 --> 21:20.792
You are right, Doctor.

21:23.709 --> 21:25.709
Could we leave now?

21:25.709 --> 21:27.625
I see no

21:25.709 --> 21:27.625
reason why not.

21:27.625 --> 21:30.208
Escort them

21:27.625 --> 21:30.208
to their quarters.

21:30.208 --> 21:31.417
Doctor.

21:31.417 --> 21:33.041
Captain, could I speak

21:31.417 --> 21:33.041
with you, please?

21:33.041 --> 21:34.792
In private.

21:34.792 --> 21:36.333
Not right now.

21:36.333 --> 21:38.166
Captain.

21:47.083 --> 21:49.000
What have you learned?

21:49.000 --> 21:51.417
The Brekkians show

21:49.000 --> 21:51.417
no sign of infection.

21:51.417 --> 21:53.625
The Ornarans show all

21:51.417 --> 21:53.625
the symptoms of a disease

21:53.625 --> 21:55.500
but I can't

21:53.625 --> 21:55.500
find a cause.

21:55.500 --> 21:57.250
Perhaps it was filtered out

21:55.500 --> 21:57.250
by the transporter

21:57.250 --> 21:58.333
when they were beamed aboard.

21:58.333 --> 21:59.667
There's no

21:58.333 --> 21:59.667
record of it

21:59.667 --> 22:01.041
then again, the solar

21:59.667 --> 22:01.041
flare activity

22:01.041 --> 22:02.291
might have caused

22:01.041 --> 22:02.291
a malfunction

22:02.291 --> 22:04.667
in the biofilters

22:02.291 --> 22:04.667
or their monitors.

22:04.667 --> 22:06.166
Are they going to die?

22:06.166 --> 22:10.375
I need to check further,

22:06.166 --> 22:10.375
but my instinct says no.

22:10.375 --> 22:12.500
Do you think that we're in

22:10.375 --> 22:12.500
any danger from this plague?

22:12.500 --> 22:14.875
Again, I need

22:12.500 --> 22:14.875
more time.

22:14.875 --> 22:18.000
There are some missing

22:14.875 --> 22:18.000
pieces to this puzzle.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.792
What's missing is

22:18.000 --> 22:20.792
a little compassion.

22:20.792 --> 22:23.083
We're losing our professional

22:20.792 --> 22:23.083
detachment, Doctor.

22:23.083 --> 22:24.208
Perhaps.

22:24.208 --> 22:25.875
But, Captain,

22:24.208 --> 22:25.875
I must tell you

22:25.875 --> 22:29.959
I am developing a

22:25.875 --> 22:29.959
very active dislike

22:25.875 --> 22:29.959
for these Brekkians.

22:29.959 --> 22:31.709
Understandable.

22:37.083 --> 22:40.709
Captain, you must

22:37.083 --> 22:40.709
give us back our cargo.

22:40.709 --> 22:42.333
I can't do that.

22:42.333 --> 22:45.291
Why? It belongs to us.

22:45.291 --> 22:46.792
The Brekkians claim

22:45.291 --> 22:46.792
it belongs to them.

22:46.792 --> 22:48.625
They lie.

22:48.625 --> 22:50.417
That may be so but...

22:50.417 --> 22:52.417
it is not

22:50.417 --> 22:52.417
my decision.

22:52.417 --> 22:53.709
We need some now.

22:53.709 --> 22:54.917
<i>Now.</i>

22:54.917 --> 22:56.000
I don't care if

22:54.917 --> 22:56.000
it's your decision--

22:56.000 --> 22:57.458
get us some.

22:57.458 --> 22:58.792
Captain, what is

22:57.458 --> 22:58.792
happening to us

22:58.792 --> 23:01.041
is happening

22:58.792 --> 23:01.041
to thousands

22:58.792 --> 23:01.041
more on Ornara.

23:01.041 --> 23:03.417
Please understand

23:01.041 --> 23:03.417
the magnitude of the problem.

23:03.417 --> 23:04.500
Your people

23:03.417 --> 23:04.500
don't need it.

23:04.500 --> 23:05.959
The Brekkians

23:04.500 --> 23:05.959
don't need it.

23:05.959 --> 23:07.750
Our people do.

23:07.750 --> 23:10.500
If you don't give it to us,

23:07.750 --> 23:10.500
you will be a party to murder--

23:10.500 --> 23:11.542
not only of us

23:11.542 --> 23:13.667
but of an entire

23:11.542 --> 23:13.667
civilization.

23:17.750 --> 23:22.458
I-I-I am sorry, I do not

23:17.750 --> 23:22.458
mean to insult you.

23:22.458 --> 23:24.667
I'm feeling very shaky.

23:24.667 --> 23:27.166
We cannot hold out

23:24.667 --> 23:27.166
much longer.

23:31.917 --> 23:33.792
They believe it

23:31.917 --> 23:33.792
will help them.

23:33.792 --> 23:35.792
That in itself might

23:33.792 --> 23:35.792
control their symptoms.

23:40.834 --> 23:43.208
I'll talk

23:40.834 --> 23:43.208
with the Brekkians.

23:43.208 --> 23:44.667
We thank you, Captain.

23:44.667 --> 23:46.750
We appreciate

23:44.667 --> 23:46.750
anything you can do.

24:10.458 --> 24:12.375
(<i> door chimes</i> )

24:15.709 --> 24:17.625
May I say, Captain,

24:15.709 --> 24:17.625
how impressed we are

24:17.625 --> 24:20.250
with your ship

24:17.625 --> 24:20.250
and all its facilities?

24:20.250 --> 24:21.291
Thank you.

24:21.291 --> 24:22.583
And its crew.

24:22.583 --> 24:25.041
Everyone is so efficient

24:22.583 --> 24:25.041
and professional.

24:25.041 --> 24:26.625
I'm glad you're comfortable.

24:26.625 --> 24:30.041
I've come to seek your agreement

24:26.625 --> 24:30.041
to an Ornaran request.

24:30.041 --> 24:31.125
We cannot agree.

24:31.125 --> 24:34.125
Wait, let the Captain speak.

24:34.125 --> 24:35.583
We want to be

24:34.125 --> 24:35.583
reasonable.

24:38.291 --> 24:40.166
The two Ornarans

24:38.291 --> 24:40.166
are really quite ill

24:40.166 --> 24:42.834
and are insisting that

24:40.166 --> 24:42.834
they need the felicium.

24:42.834 --> 24:45.250
That is not surprising.

24:45.250 --> 24:47.041
Would you object

24:45.250 --> 24:47.041
to giving them enough

24:47.041 --> 24:50.041
for their own

24:47.041 --> 24:50.041
immediate needs?

24:50.041 --> 24:53.667
Captain, we Brekkians

24:50.041 --> 24:53.667
are in business.

24:53.667 --> 24:55.458
We are not in the habit

24:53.667 --> 24:55.458
of giving away

24:55.458 --> 24:57.875
that which has not

24:55.458 --> 24:57.875
been paid for.

24:57.875 --> 25:01.291
You would see them die,

24:57.875 --> 25:01.291
rather than share the medicine?

25:01.291 --> 25:03.917
LANGOR:

25:01.291 --> 25:03.917
We want to be

25:01.291 --> 25:03.917
fair, Captain.

25:03.917 --> 25:06.208
We agree to permitting

25:03.917 --> 25:06.208
them two doses

25:06.208 --> 25:09.041
for immediate use.

25:09.041 --> 25:11.291
No charge.

25:11.291 --> 25:14.000
I'll let my medical

25:11.291 --> 25:14.000
officer handle it.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.834
Captain...

25:15.834 --> 25:17.166
I trust you won't mind

25:17.166 --> 25:19.417
if we're present

25:17.166 --> 25:19.417
while you open the cargo.

25:37.041 --> 25:40.000
What does that device do?

25:40.000 --> 25:43.917
This measures

25:40.000 --> 25:43.917
the individual portions.

25:43.917 --> 25:45.709
What's the dosage?

25:45.709 --> 25:49.125
.01 milliliters.

25:49.125 --> 25:51.959
A very potent substance.

25:51.959 --> 25:55.166
We've improved our distillation

25:51.959 --> 25:55.166
process over the years.

25:55.166 --> 25:57.291
In my grandfather's day,

25:55.166 --> 25:57.291
this same amount of felicium

25:57.291 --> 26:00.417
would have filled

25:57.291 --> 26:00.417
five rooms this size.

26:00.417 --> 26:02.333
But, now with our

26:00.417 --> 26:02.333
improved processes

26:02.333 --> 26:06.333
this one barrel contains

26:02.333 --> 26:06.333
over 4,000,000,000 doses.

26:06.333 --> 26:09.625
I would estimate

26:06.333 --> 26:09.625
4 billion, 375 million...

26:09.625 --> 26:11.500
Thank you, Mr. Data.

26:13.291 --> 26:15.250
How long is

26:13.291 --> 26:15.250
the dosage effective?

26:15.250 --> 26:17.208
LANGOR:

26:15.250 --> 26:17.208
It varies with

26:15.250 --> 26:17.208
the individual.

26:17.208 --> 26:19.750
But never more

26:17.208 --> 26:19.750
than 72 hours.

26:19.750 --> 26:21.583
And then the symptoms return?

26:21.583 --> 26:22.959
Yes.

26:22.959 --> 26:25.208
Unfortunately, there is

26:22.959 --> 26:25.208
no cure for the plague.

26:25.208 --> 26:29.166
But felicium inhibits the

26:25.208 --> 26:29.166
sickness with total efficiency.

26:29.166 --> 26:32.834
Allowing the Ornarans

26:29.166 --> 26:32.834
to lead normal lives.

26:32.834 --> 26:35.625
An unusual disease--

26:35.625 --> 26:39.250
virulent, extremely persistent

26:39.250 --> 26:41.709
yet I can't

26:39.250 --> 26:41.709
isolate it.

26:41.709 --> 26:43.208
The plague has

26:41.709 --> 26:43.208
baffled doctors

26:43.208 --> 26:45.959
on both planets

26:43.208 --> 26:45.959
for 200 years.

26:45.959 --> 26:48.166
We've therefore concentrated

26:45.959 --> 26:48.166
on treatment--

26:48.166 --> 26:51.250
finding new ways

26:48.166 --> 26:51.250
to improve the potency

26:51.250 --> 26:52.875
and purity

26:51.250 --> 26:52.875
of felicium.

26:52.875 --> 26:54.667
DATA:

26:52.875 --> 26:54.667
No doubt you have

26:52.875 --> 26:54.667
applied your technology

26:54.667 --> 26:57.875
from other industries to the

26:54.667 --> 26:57.875
refinement of this product.

26:57.875 --> 26:59.834
We have no other industry.

26:59.834 --> 27:00.959
None at all?

27:00.959 --> 27:02.500
We don't

27:00.959 --> 27:02.500
need any.

27:02.500 --> 27:04.750
The Ornarans provide us

27:02.500 --> 27:04.750
with everything we need

27:04.750 --> 27:06.625
in exchange for this.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.041
Fascinating.

27:08.041 --> 27:10.291
Your society

27:08.041 --> 27:10.291
dedicated exclusively

27:10.291 --> 27:12.375
to the production

27:10.291 --> 27:12.375
of a single product.

27:12.375 --> 27:14.417
A product for which

27:12.375 --> 27:14.417
you have no use

27:14.417 --> 27:17.333
but which the Ornarans

27:14.417 --> 27:17.333
cannot live without.

27:17.333 --> 27:19.959
One of life's little ironies,

27:17.333 --> 27:19.959
Captain.

27:19.959 --> 27:22.583
But one would be fools

27:19.959 --> 27:22.583
not to take advantage of.

27:22.583 --> 27:25.417
It's mutually beneficial.

27:25.417 --> 27:28.917
The Ornarans provide us

27:25.417 --> 27:28.917
with the necessities of life

27:28.917 --> 27:32.250
and we provide them

27:28.917 --> 27:32.250
with the necessities of living.

27:32.250 --> 27:34.375
It is a fair exchange.

27:34.375 --> 27:36.875
Interesting

27:34.375 --> 27:36.875
relationship.

27:36.875 --> 27:37.959
Excuse me.

27:37.959 --> 27:38.959
I'll take that

27:38.959 --> 27:40.291
to Sick Bay.

27:49.667 --> 27:50.709
BEVERLY:

27:49.667 --> 27:50.709
Can I help?

27:50.709 --> 27:52.458
No...

28:02.083 --> 28:03.625
Hurry up.

28:26.333 --> 28:28.375
You're feeling better?

28:28.375 --> 28:31.625
Yes, thank you.

28:31.625 --> 28:33.291
I'm fine now.

28:44.041 --> 28:45.125
(<i> door chimes</i> )

28:45.125 --> 28:46.250
Come.

28:48.250 --> 28:52.000
Doctor?

28:52.000 --> 28:54.166
I may not know

28:52.000 --> 28:54.166
felicium's full effect

28:54.166 --> 28:55.709
on Ornaran physiology

28:55.709 --> 28:56.875
but I know

28:56.875 --> 28:59.250
how to interpret

28:56.875 --> 28:59.250
physical reactions.

28:59.250 --> 29:01.083
Are the Ornarans recovering?

29:01.083 --> 29:04.083
T'Jon and Romas

29:01.083 --> 29:04.083
are feeling fine.

29:04.083 --> 29:05.834
In fact, too fine.

29:05.834 --> 29:09.041
Felicium's a narcotic.

29:09.041 --> 29:10.750
Then T'Jon and Romas

29:10.750 --> 29:12.417
and everyone on their world...

29:12.417 --> 29:13.959
Is a drug addict.

29:29.834 --> 29:31.083
I think you'll find

29:29.834 --> 29:31.083
it's a fascinating tale

29:31.083 --> 29:32.542
that we've come across

29:31.083 --> 29:32.542
here, Captain.

29:32.542 --> 29:34.000
You've piqued my interest,

29:32.542 --> 29:34.000
Number One.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.125
Please continue.

29:35.125 --> 29:36.583
Data, what have we got?

29:36.583 --> 29:38.250
Beginning several

29:36.583 --> 29:38.250
thousand years ago

29:38.250 --> 29:41.208
the two planets

29:38.250 --> 29:41.208
took different paths.

29:41.208 --> 29:43.625
Ornara became technologically

29:41.208 --> 29:43.625
sophisticated.

29:43.625 --> 29:45.000
Brekka did not.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.875
Then,

29:45.000 --> 29:46.875
200 years ago

29:46.875 --> 29:49.834
Ornara was stricken

29:46.875 --> 29:49.834
by a devastating plague.

29:49.834 --> 29:52.750
Their advanced technology

29:49.834 --> 29:52.750
could provide no solution.

29:52.750 --> 29:55.959
Somehow, and there is limited

29:52.750 --> 29:55.959
information on this point

29:55.959 --> 29:57.750
a cure was found in a plant

29:57.750 --> 29:59.333
indigenous

29:57.750 --> 29:59.333
only to Brekka

29:59.333 --> 30:00.625
and which rejected

30:00.625 --> 30:02.959
all attempts at cultivation

30:00.625 --> 30:02.959
on Ornara.

30:02.959 --> 30:04.667
In any case,

30:02.959 --> 30:04.667
a trading situation developed

30:04.667 --> 30:06.041
which still

30:04.667 --> 30:06.041
exists.

30:06.041 --> 30:08.125
A nice arrangement

30:06.041 --> 30:08.125
for the Brekkians.

30:08.125 --> 30:09.500
And for the Ornarans.

30:09.500 --> 30:11.458
Without the medicine,

30:09.500 --> 30:11.458
they would all die.

30:11.458 --> 30:12.834
No, they wouldn't.

30:12.834 --> 30:14.792
Despite what the Ornarans

30:12.834 --> 30:14.792
have been saying

30:14.792 --> 30:16.250
it is not a medicine.

30:16.250 --> 30:17.500
It was a medicine

30:17.500 --> 30:20.375
but it cured the plague

30:17.500 --> 30:20.375
200 years ago.

30:20.375 --> 30:21.750
The plague is irrelevant now.

30:21.750 --> 30:23.291
It doesn't exist.

30:23.291 --> 30:24.375
Then why are they so desperate

30:24.375 --> 30:25.625
for the felicium?

30:25.625 --> 30:27.083
It's an addiction.

30:27.083 --> 30:29.667
The physical

30:27.083 --> 30:29.667
and psychological

30:27.083 --> 30:29.667
need is very real.

30:33.667 --> 30:36.458
Thank you.

30:36.458 --> 30:37.917
What are you

30:36.458 --> 30:37.917
going to do?

30:37.917 --> 30:39.333
Based on what

30:37.917 --> 30:39.333
we know so far

30:39.333 --> 30:41.208
there's nothing I can do.

30:41.208 --> 30:42.959
You don't think drug addiction

30:41.208 --> 30:42.959
and exploitation

30:42.959 --> 30:44.917
is sufficient cause

30:42.959 --> 30:44.917
to do something?

30:44.917 --> 30:48.500
This situation has existed

30:44.917 --> 30:48.500
for a very long time.

30:48.500 --> 30:51.709
These two societies

30:48.500 --> 30:51.709
are intertwined

30:51.709 --> 30:53.959
in a symbiotic relationship.

30:53.959 --> 30:55.166
With one society

30:55.166 --> 30:57.583
profiting at the expense

30:55.166 --> 30:57.583
of the other.

30:57.583 --> 31:00.750
That's how you see it.

31:00.750 --> 31:04.125
I can synthesize

31:00.750 --> 31:04.125
a non-addictive substitute

31:04.125 --> 31:08.875
which will ease

31:04.125 --> 31:08.875
their withdrawal symptoms.

31:08.875 --> 31:12.375
No, I can't do that either.

31:12.375 --> 31:14.792
You can't let them

31:12.375 --> 31:14.792
have the felicium.

31:14.792 --> 31:17.667
Why, because it offends

31:14.792 --> 31:17.667
against our sensibilities?

31:17.667 --> 31:20.500
It is not our mission to impose

31:17.667 --> 31:20.500
Federation or Earth values

31:20.500 --> 31:23.208
on any others in the galaxy.

31:23.208 --> 31:28.417
Well, in this case, Captain,

31:23.208 --> 31:28.417
I disagree 100 percent.

31:28.417 --> 31:30.041
YAR:

31:28.417 --> 31:30.041
Captain, I'm receiving a call

31:30.041 --> 31:31.333
from Ornara.

31:31.333 --> 31:32.792
The signal

31:31.333 --> 31:32.792
is ragged,

31:31.333 --> 31:32.792
but I think

31:32.792 --> 31:34.375
I can put it

31:32.792 --> 31:34.375
on the viewscreen.

31:34.375 --> 31:35.625
PICARD:

31:34.375 --> 31:35.625
Do it.

31:39.917 --> 31:42.834
I'm Margan.

31:42.834 --> 31:45.959
Are my people on board

31:42.834 --> 31:45.959
your ship?

31:49.792 --> 31:52.792
Some of them, yes.

31:52.792 --> 31:55.667
May I speak to them?

31:55.667 --> 31:57.000
Yes.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.500
Lieutenant Yar, have

31:57.000 --> 31:58.500
the Ornarans brought in.

31:58.500 --> 32:00.875
No, wait.

32:00.875 --> 32:05.208
I don't want them to have

32:00.875 --> 32:05.208
access to the Bridge.

32:05.208 --> 32:07.083
We will contact you

32:05.208 --> 32:07.083
in a few minutes.

32:12.917 --> 32:14.500
I will continue this

32:12.917 --> 32:14.500
in the guest quarters.

32:14.500 --> 32:18.333
Commander.

32:14.500 --> 32:18.333
Doctor.

32:25.250 --> 32:27.500
Data, I can understand

32:27.500 --> 32:30.083
how this could happen

32:27.500 --> 32:30.083
to the Ornarans.

32:30.083 --> 32:31.667
What I can't understand

32:31.667 --> 32:33.417
is why anyone

32:31.667 --> 32:33.417
would voluntarily

32:33.417 --> 32:35.583
become dependent

32:33.417 --> 32:35.583
on a chemical.

32:35.583 --> 32:37.208
DATA:

32:35.583 --> 32:37.208
Voluntary

32:35.583 --> 32:37.208
addiction to drugs

32:37.208 --> 32:39.208
is a recurrent theme

32:37.208 --> 32:39.208
in many cultures.

32:39.208 --> 32:42.166
Wesley, no one wants

32:39.208 --> 32:42.166
to become dependent.

32:42.166 --> 32:43.542
That happens later.

32:43.542 --> 32:45.000
But it does happen.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
So why do people start?

32:47.000 --> 32:48.291
On my home planet

32:48.291 --> 32:50.500
there was so much poverty

32:48.291 --> 32:50.500
and violence

32:50.500 --> 32:54.083
that for some, the only escape

32:50.500 --> 32:54.083
was through drugs.

32:54.083 --> 32:57.291
How can a chemical substance

32:54.083 --> 32:57.291
provide an escape?

32:57.291 --> 32:59.000
It doesn't

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
but it makes you think

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
it does.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
You have to understand

33:03.000 --> 33:07.125
drugs can make you feel good.

33:07.125 --> 33:08.709
They make you feel

33:07.125 --> 33:08.709
on top of the world.

33:08.709 --> 33:13.083
You're happy,

33:08.709 --> 33:13.083
sure of yourself, in control.

33:13.083 --> 33:14.667
But it's artificial.

33:14.667 --> 33:16.208
It doesn't feel

33:14.667 --> 33:16.208
artificial

33:16.208 --> 33:19.000
until the drug

33:16.208 --> 33:19.000
wears off.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.709
Then you pay

33:19.000 --> 33:20.709
the price.

33:20.709 --> 33:22.041
Before you know it

33:22.041 --> 33:24.959
you're taking the drug

33:22.041 --> 33:24.959
not to feel good

33:24.959 --> 33:27.291
but to keep from feeling bad.

33:27.291 --> 33:28.709
And that's the trap.

33:28.709 --> 33:31.583
All you care

33:28.709 --> 33:31.583
about is getting

33:28.709 --> 33:31.583
your next dosage.

33:31.583 --> 33:35.333
Nothing else matters.

33:35.333 --> 33:37.834
I guess I just don't understand.

33:37.834 --> 33:41.000
Wesley, I hope you never do.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.458
PICARD:

33:41.000 --> 33:43.458
Lieutenant Yar, we're ready

33:41.000 --> 33:43.458
in the guest quarters.

33:53.500 --> 33:55.291
(<i> static</i> )

33:55.291 --> 33:58.417
T'Jon?

33:58.417 --> 34:00.125
Do you have it?

34:00.125 --> 34:03.125
Yes, it is

34:00.125 --> 34:03.125
here, but...

34:03.125 --> 34:04.750
You've got to get it to us.

34:04.750 --> 34:06.458
T'Jon, please.

34:06.458 --> 34:08.250
We're dying down here.

34:08.250 --> 34:11.458
You don't know, it's worse

34:08.250 --> 34:11.458
than it's ever been before.

34:11.458 --> 34:13.375
I'm doing

34:11.458 --> 34:13.375
everything I can.

34:13.375 --> 34:15.542
You see, what

34:13.375 --> 34:15.542
happened was...

34:15.542 --> 34:16.667
Stop!

34:16.667 --> 34:18.875
I can't listen anymore!

34:18.875 --> 34:20.125
T'Jon.

34:20.125 --> 34:22.500
There's so many people here!

34:22.500 --> 34:24.333
So much suffering.

34:24.333 --> 34:25.583
We need the medicine.

34:25.583 --> 34:28.750
You've got to get it to us!

34:28.750 --> 34:32.709
I can't go on.

34:32.709 --> 34:34.375
Help, T'Jon.

34:37.917 --> 34:39.542
Please.

34:46.917 --> 34:48.709
I'm sorry.

34:54.834 --> 34:56.542
You will take us

34:54.834 --> 34:56.542
to our planet

34:56.542 --> 35:00.041
and leave us there

34:56.542 --> 35:00.041
with our medicine or

34:56.542 --> 35:00.041
this person dies.

35:00.041 --> 35:02.500
Don't you see,

35:00.041 --> 35:02.500
I have no choice.

35:02.500 --> 35:05.291
We were sent to bring

35:02.500 --> 35:05.291
the felicium back.

35:05.291 --> 35:07.208
The suffering

35:05.291 --> 35:07.208
on my planet

35:05.291 --> 35:07.208
is too great.

35:07.208 --> 35:09.291
People are dying.

35:09.291 --> 35:10.417
It doesn't matter

35:10.417 --> 35:11.667
whether we're

35:10.417 --> 35:11.667
entitled to it or not.

35:11.667 --> 35:13.166
We must have it.

35:13.166 --> 35:14.458
Let him go.

35:14.458 --> 35:16.917
You will take us

35:14.458 --> 35:16.917
there now.

35:16.917 --> 35:18.375
Or give us a shuttle

35:18.375 --> 35:21.583
but we must have

35:18.375 --> 35:21.583
the medicine.

35:21.583 --> 35:26.125
If you refuse,

35:21.583 --> 35:26.125
this person will die.

35:26.125 --> 35:28.250
I will not be coerced.

35:28.250 --> 35:30.875
I will do it.

35:30.875 --> 35:32.250
I will kill him.

35:35.667 --> 35:37.458
No.

35:37.458 --> 35:38.875
No, you won't.

35:38.875 --> 35:40.417
You're not a killer.

35:49.667 --> 35:53.208
Help us, please.

35:53.208 --> 35:54.625
Help us.

36:00.542 --> 36:02.333
I'm not sure that I can.

36:18.375 --> 36:20.750
My insides are

36:18.375 --> 36:20.750
still shaking

36:20.750 --> 36:22.375
but I'm

36:20.750 --> 36:22.375
all right.

36:22.375 --> 36:24.542
(<i> door chimes</i> )

36:24.542 --> 36:26.875
Captain Picard,

36:24.542 --> 36:26.875
could I see you a moment?

36:29.250 --> 36:31.667
I'll stay here.

36:31.667 --> 36:32.875
PICARD:

36:31.667 --> 36:32.875
Come with me,

36:31.667 --> 36:32.875
Doctor.

36:32.875 --> 36:34.667
This could be

36:32.875 --> 36:34.667
interesting.

36:43.667 --> 36:46.250
LANGOR:

36:43.667 --> 36:46.250
We have thought

36:43.667 --> 36:46.250
about this a great deal.

36:46.250 --> 36:47.500
We both feel deeply

36:47.500 --> 36:49.834
about what is

36:47.500 --> 36:49.834
happening on Ornara.

36:49.834 --> 36:51.083
And although

36:49.834 --> 36:51.083
it is going to cause

36:51.083 --> 36:54.792
hardship to us

36:51.083 --> 36:54.792
and to our people

36:54.792 --> 36:57.834
we have decided to give

36:54.792 --> 36:57.834
the felicium to them.

36:57.834 --> 37:00.875
They can pay

36:57.834 --> 37:00.875
whenever they are able.

37:00.875 --> 37:02.166
We don't

37:00.875 --> 37:02.166
want to be

37:02.166 --> 37:04.959
the ones responsible

37:02.166 --> 37:04.959
for their suffering.

37:04.959 --> 37:07.625
There goes

37:04.959 --> 37:07.625
the other shoe.

37:07.625 --> 37:09.166
They know.

37:09.166 --> 37:10.750
What do they know?

37:10.750 --> 37:12.875
They know that the Ornarans

37:10.750 --> 37:12.875
no longer have the plague.

37:12.875 --> 37:14.041
They know

37:12.875 --> 37:14.041
that felicium

37:14.041 --> 37:16.291
is no longer

37:14.041 --> 37:16.291
a medicine.

37:16.291 --> 37:20.250
So, of course, they are willing

37:16.291 --> 37:20.250
to<i> give</i> this shipment

37:20.250 --> 37:21.917
because they don't want to take

37:20.250 --> 37:21.917
the chance that the Ornarans

37:21.917 --> 37:24.125
will lose

37:21.917 --> 37:24.125
their addiction.

37:24.125 --> 37:26.834
They don't want to lose

37:24.125 --> 37:26.834
their only customers.

37:26.834 --> 37:28.583
How would they have known

37:26.834 --> 37:28.583
all of that

37:28.583 --> 37:31.875
unless the plague had once

37:28.583 --> 37:31.875
infected their planet, as well?

37:31.875 --> 37:33.458
They were infected.

37:33.458 --> 37:35.542
They used the felicium

37:33.458 --> 37:35.542
to cure themselves

37:35.542 --> 37:39.667
but, somehow, their ancestors

37:35.542 --> 37:39.667
realized that it was a narcotic.

37:39.667 --> 37:41.166
BEVERLY:

37:39.667 --> 37:41.166
They broke the cycle

37:39.667 --> 37:41.166
of addiction

37:41.166 --> 37:43.083
and never told

37:41.166 --> 37:43.083
the Ornarans?

37:43.083 --> 37:44.667
They let them

37:43.083 --> 37:44.667
continue to believe

37:44.667 --> 37:47.250
that, without the felicium,

37:44.667 --> 37:47.250
they would die?

37:47.250 --> 37:48.959
PICARD:

37:47.250 --> 37:48.959
I think it's worse

37:47.250 --> 37:48.959
than that.

37:48.959 --> 37:50.500
My guess

37:48.959 --> 37:50.500
is that

37:50.500 --> 37:53.041
this refining process,

37:50.500 --> 37:53.041
of which you are so proud...

37:53.041 --> 37:55.333
Is only to increase

37:53.041 --> 37:55.333
the potency of the felicium

37:55.333 --> 38:00.125
and tighten

37:55.333 --> 38:00.125
your grip.

38:00.125 --> 38:01.959
What are you going to do?

38:01.959 --> 38:04.542
Are you going

38:01.959 --> 38:04.542
to tell them?

38:04.542 --> 38:08.250
No, I'm bound by the rules of

38:04.542 --> 38:08.250
the United Federation of Planets

38:08.250 --> 38:09.500
which order me not to interfere

38:09.500 --> 38:11.834
with other worlds,

38:09.500 --> 38:11.834
other cultures.

38:11.834 --> 38:13.208
If I were to tell them

38:11.834 --> 38:13.208
any of this

38:13.208 --> 38:15.959
I would violate

38:13.208 --> 38:15.959
that Prime Directive.

38:15.959 --> 38:19.500
But you are talking to us

38:15.959 --> 38:19.500
about it.

38:19.500 --> 38:21.917
This is information

38:19.500 --> 38:21.917
you already know

38:21.917 --> 38:23.917
and so nothing

38:21.917 --> 38:23.917
is changed.

38:23.917 --> 38:25.417
If you can't interfere

38:25.417 --> 38:28.375
then you are going to allow

38:25.417 --> 38:28.375
the Ornarans to have

38:28.375 --> 38:30.458
the felicium.

38:30.458 --> 38:31.917
Yes, I am.

38:31.917 --> 38:34.375
No, don't do it.

38:34.375 --> 38:35.875
Jean-Luc,

38:34.375 --> 38:35.875
this is not

38:35.875 --> 38:37.875
a symbiotic

38:35.875 --> 38:37.875
relationship.

38:37.875 --> 38:41.250
This is exploitation--

38:37.875 --> 38:41.250
pure and simple.

38:41.250 --> 38:43.583
The Brekkians have

38:41.250 --> 38:43.583
caused all of this

38:41.250 --> 38:43.583
suffering and hardship

38:43.583 --> 38:46.000
only to make their

38:43.583 --> 38:46.000
pitiful lives easier.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.834
And all of it

38:46.000 --> 38:48.834
based on a lie.

38:48.834 --> 38:50.917
No, deny them

38:48.834 --> 38:50.917
this shipment.

38:50.917 --> 38:53.542
It is the least

38:50.917 --> 38:53.542
we can do.

38:53.542 --> 38:56.375
From the moment they agreed

38:53.542 --> 38:56.375
to give them the felicium

38:56.375 --> 38:58.083
my hands were tied.

38:58.083 --> 39:00.834
LANGOR:

38:58.083 --> 39:00.834
You are absolutely

38:58.083 --> 39:00.834
right, Captain.

39:00.834 --> 39:03.792
It's not your business.

39:05.875 --> 39:07.000
T'JON:

39:05.875 --> 39:07.000
Are these

39:05.875 --> 39:07.000
the spare parts

39:07.000 --> 39:08.917
for our freighters?

39:08.917 --> 39:10.417
They look

39:08.917 --> 39:10.417
complicated.

39:10.417 --> 39:12.667
Are they already...

39:12.667 --> 39:14.625
Aligned?

39:12.667 --> 39:14.625
Right.

39:14.625 --> 39:16.667
You'd have to ask

39:14.625 --> 39:16.667
the Captain.

39:18.959 --> 39:21.083
LA FORGE:

39:18.959 --> 39:21.083
Captain Picard,

39:18.959 --> 39:21.083
we've arrived at Ornara

39:21.083 --> 39:22.667
and assumed standard orbit.

39:22.667 --> 39:24.000
Acknowledged.

39:22.667 --> 39:24.000
Thank you.

39:26.041 --> 39:27.125
Captain, please.

39:27.125 --> 39:28.917
My planet

39:27.125 --> 39:28.917
is suffering.

39:28.917 --> 39:30.709
We beg you

39:28.917 --> 39:30.709
to give us

39:30.709 --> 39:32.375
our medicine.

39:32.375 --> 39:33.917
The matter is already decided.

39:33.917 --> 39:38.125
You're beaming down to your

39:33.917 --> 39:38.125
world with the felicium.

39:38.125 --> 39:39.417
Great.

39:39.417 --> 39:41.500
(<i> laughing</i> )

39:41.500 --> 39:42.500
I knew it.

39:42.500 --> 39:44.375
I knew

39:42.500 --> 39:44.375
you'd help us.

39:44.375 --> 39:45.709
We thank you.

39:45.709 --> 39:47.375
Don't thank me.

39:47.375 --> 39:48.959
Sobi and Langor--

39:48.959 --> 39:51.792
they decided

39:48.959 --> 39:51.792
to let you

39:48.959 --> 39:51.792
have it.

39:51.792 --> 39:54.750
We'll discuss

39:51.792 --> 39:54.750
the payment terms later.

39:54.750 --> 39:56.291
In the meantime,

39:54.750 --> 39:56.291
there's no reason

39:56.291 --> 39:58.917
to deprive you

39:56.291 --> 39:58.917
of your needed medicine.

39:58.917 --> 40:00.542
That's terrific.

40:00.542 --> 40:02.041
I'm sure

40:00.542 --> 40:02.041
we can come

40:02.041 --> 40:04.875
to a fair deal

40:02.041 --> 40:04.875
for payment.

40:04.875 --> 40:07.792
May we beam down with

40:04.875 --> 40:07.792
you and discuss it?

40:07.792 --> 40:09.583
Of course.

40:09.583 --> 40:11.709
You are quite

40:09.583 --> 40:11.709
welcome on Ornara.

40:11.709 --> 40:14.709
We appreciate

40:11.709 --> 40:14.709
your hospitality.

40:14.709 --> 40:17.375
T'JON:

40:14.709 --> 40:17.375
And Captain--

40:17.375 --> 40:21.166
we appreciate

40:17.375 --> 40:21.166
your gift of the coils.

40:21.166 --> 40:23.333
Once our freighters

40:21.166 --> 40:23.333
are fixed, everything

40:23.333 --> 40:25.166
will be back

40:23.333 --> 40:25.166
to normal.

40:25.166 --> 40:27.041
No.

40:27.041 --> 40:29.208
No?

40:29.208 --> 40:30.917
The coils stay here.

40:33.875 --> 40:35.583
What about

40:33.875 --> 40:35.583
our freighters?

40:35.583 --> 40:37.375
PICARD:

40:35.583 --> 40:37.375
If you want

40:35.583 --> 40:37.375
to repair them

40:37.375 --> 40:40.959
you'll have to learn

40:37.375 --> 40:40.959
to do it yourselves.

40:40.959 --> 40:42.750
We can't.

40:42.750 --> 40:44.083
If you don't help

40:42.750 --> 40:44.083
us, our ships

40:44.083 --> 40:45.917
will soon

40:44.083 --> 40:45.917
be inoperable.

40:45.917 --> 40:47.291
Quite possibly.

40:47.291 --> 40:48.875
If you withhold those coils

40:48.875 --> 40:52.375
you'll be disrupting the

40:48.875 --> 40:52.375
stability of both our planets.

40:52.375 --> 40:54.166
And interfering

40:52.375 --> 40:54.166
with a trade agreement

40:54.166 --> 40:56.583
that has lasted for generations.

40:56.583 --> 40:58.667
What of your Prime Directive?

40:58.667 --> 41:00.250
In this situation,

40:58.667 --> 41:00.250
the Prime Directive

41:00.250 --> 41:02.542
prohibits me from helping you.

41:02.542 --> 41:04.917
That's absurd!

41:04.917 --> 41:08.166
You did not think so

41:04.917 --> 41:08.166
when it worked in your favor.

41:08.166 --> 41:10.917
Do you want our world to suffer?

41:10.917 --> 41:13.083
Oh no, I don't want that.

41:13.083 --> 41:14.667
T'JON:

41:13.083 --> 41:14.667
Without

41:13.083 --> 41:14.667
the freighters

41:14.667 --> 41:17.959
there will be no more shipments

41:14.667 --> 41:17.959
of felicium.

41:17.959 --> 41:19.458
We will die.

41:19.458 --> 41:21.583
You must trust

41:19.458 --> 41:21.583
yourselves.

41:21.583 --> 41:24.667
There are...

41:21.583 --> 41:24.667
other options.

41:30.583 --> 41:32.125
Ensign, prepare

41:30.583 --> 41:32.125
to beam our guests

41:32.125 --> 41:33.959
and their cargo

41:32.125 --> 41:33.959
down to Ornara.

41:45.208 --> 41:51.000
Captain, I hope you realize

41:45.208 --> 41:51.000
what you've done to us.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.667
Of that, you can be sure.

41:55.625 --> 41:57.166
Good luck.

42:19.166 --> 42:21.041
Main bridge.

42:19.166 --> 42:21.041
(<i> beeping</i> )

42:25.834 --> 42:27.667
When the felicium

42:25.834 --> 42:27.667
runs out

42:27.667 --> 42:31.208
the people of Ornara

42:27.667 --> 42:31.208
will suffer horrible

42:27.667 --> 42:31.208
withdrawal pains.

42:31.208 --> 42:35.375
No doubt,

42:31.208 --> 42:35.375
but they will pass.

42:35.375 --> 42:37.375
That seems so cruel.

42:37.375 --> 42:40.000
We could have made

42:37.375 --> 42:40.000
their burden easier.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.709
Could have?

42:42.709 --> 42:47.000
Perhaps

42:42.709 --> 42:47.000
in the short term

42:47.000 --> 42:48.792
but to what end?

42:48.792 --> 42:50.959
Hold.

42:48.792 --> 42:50.959
(<i> beeping</i> )

42:57.750 --> 43:02.083
Beverly, the Prime Directive

42:57.750 --> 43:02.083
is not just a set of rules.

43:02.083 --> 43:04.625
It is a philosophy,

43:02.083 --> 43:04.625
and a very correct one.

43:08.208 --> 43:10.709
History has proved

43:08.208 --> 43:10.709
again and again

43:10.709 --> 43:12.458
that whenever mankind interferes

43:12.458 --> 43:15.458
with a less-developed

43:12.458 --> 43:15.458
civilization

43:15.458 --> 43:17.000
no matter

43:15.458 --> 43:17.000
how well

43:15.458 --> 43:17.000
intentioned

43:17.000 --> 43:19.291
that interference may be

43:19.291 --> 43:24.000
the results

43:19.291 --> 43:24.000
are invariably disastrous.

43:24.000 --> 43:28.375
It's hard to be philosophical

43:24.000 --> 43:28.375
when faced with suffering.

43:28.375 --> 43:31.333
Believe me, Beverly, there was

43:28.375 --> 43:31.333
only one decision.

43:31.333 --> 43:34.583
I just hope

43:31.333 --> 43:34.583
it was the right one.

43:34.583 --> 43:37.500
And we may

43:34.583 --> 43:37.500
never know.

43:37.500 --> 43:39.458
Resume.

43:37.500 --> 43:39.458
(<i> beeping</i> )

43:46.208 --> 43:47.792
Mr. La Forge,

43:46.208 --> 43:47.792
take us out of orbit.

43:47.792 --> 43:49.166
Destination, sir?

43:52.250 --> 43:53.917
I don't care.

43:53.917 --> 43:56.583
Let's just get some distance

43:53.917 --> 43:56.583
between us and this system.

43:56.583 --> 43:58.291
LA FORGE:

43:56.583 --> 43:58.291
Aye, sir.

43:58.291 --> 44:01.250
Course nine-seven-zero

43:58.291 --> 44:01.250
mark three-one-eight.

44:01.250 --> 44:03.667
Speed, warp three.

44:03.667 --> 44:05.792
Where will that take us,

44:03.667 --> 44:05.792
Mr. La Forge?

44:05.792 --> 44:07.250
The Opperline system.

44:09.500 --> 44:10.959
An interesting choice.

44:12.083 --> 44:13.625
Why?

44:13.625 --> 44:15.458
Curiosity.

44:15.458 --> 44:17.166
We've never been there.

44:24.625 --> 44:26.792
Engage.
