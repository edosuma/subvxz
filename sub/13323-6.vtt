[pig grunting]

00:13.247 --> 00:14.948
- Andy.

00:14.982 --> 00:16.850
Not in the mood.

Stop--

00:31.332 --> 00:33.201
- Hey, Mom!

00:33.234 --> 00:36.170
- I'm hungry.
- Where's Daddy?

00:37.271 --> 00:40.141
Andy? Andy?

00:42.943 --> 00:45.079
Hey. Wake up.

00:45.113 --> 00:47.448
- Wh--what happened?

00:47.481 --> 00:49.450
- I have no idea.

00:53.821 --> 00:56.957
* I'm feeling fine,
I'm feeling fine *

01:09.570 --> 01:12.039
- We--we must have been robbed.

01:12.140 --> 01:14.007
- This isn't ours.

01:14.041 --> 01:16.444
- We must have robbed
someone else.

01:16.477 --> 01:20.414
- I feel like a rat is gnawing
its way out of my skull.

01:20.448 --> 01:22.316
[groans]
How much did we drink?

01:22.350 --> 01:27.054
- Like Keith Richards threw
Hemingway a bachelor party.

01:27.155 --> 01:28.289
- Just the two of us?

01:28.322 --> 01:30.358
It's a miracle we're alive.

01:30.391 --> 01:31.959
- Our friends helped.

01:31.992 --> 01:33.927
- What friends?

01:33.961 --> 01:35.196
[doorbell rings]

01:38.532 --> 01:41.569
- I'll tidy up.

01:41.602 --> 01:44.172

Go, go, go Jill.

[laughing]

01:48.342 --> 01:50.511
How are you feeling
this morning?

01:50.544 --> 01:52.913
- Uh...not good.

01:52.946 --> 01:55.649
- God, you and Andy are legends.

01:55.683 --> 01:58.352
I mean, you guys were still
going hard when we crashed.

01:58.386 --> 02:00.888
- Right.
When was that?

02:00.921 --> 02:03.023
- Uh, 4:00 a.m.

02:03.056 --> 02:04.458
Right around the time
you guys started

02:04.492 --> 02:06.059
crank-calling the White House.

02:06.093 --> 02:08.028
It was off the chain.

02:08.061 --> 02:09.497
Can I just tell you something?

02:09.530 --> 02:12.533
Talking with you last night
was like medicine.

02:12.566 --> 02:15.503
I have girlfriends of 20 years
I don't connect with like that.

02:15.536 --> 02:18.572
Do you think that we could keep
some of that stuff between us?

02:18.606 --> 02:20.641
You know, in particular,

02:20.674 --> 02:23.544
the story I told you about me
and my IUD at the Met.

02:23.577 --> 02:25.413
So embarrassing.

02:25.446 --> 02:28.081
- That won't be a problem.
- Great.

02:28.115 --> 02:30.218
Our brunch date
is about to commence,

02:30.218 --> 02:32.052
so I will see you over
at our apartment--

02:32.085 --> 02:34.522
4-G, in case you forgot.

02:44.064 --> 02:46.667
- [sighs]

02:48.736 --> 02:50.438
- Good morning, Boo.

02:50.471 --> 02:53.073
- Too ethnic.

02:53.106 --> 02:54.342
- Pumpkin?

02:54.375 --> 02:57.077
- Too round.

02:57.110 --> 02:58.346
- Brookie Bear.

02:58.379 --> 03:01.249
- [giggles]
That's more like it.

03:01.249 --> 03:03.251
Oh, I missed this.

03:03.251 --> 03:04.418
- Me too.

03:04.452 --> 03:06.454
Listen, Brookie Bear,

03:06.487 --> 03:08.322
about what happened,
I just want to say--

03:08.356 --> 03:11.692
- Shh.
Let's not pick that scab.

03:11.725 --> 03:14.728
- What did I do to deserve you?

03:16.630 --> 03:17.798
- Wait!

03:17.831 --> 03:19.633
We haven't made it official yet.

03:19.667 --> 03:22.436
- Uh, I seem to remember
making it official

03:22.470 --> 03:24.272
2 1/2 times last night.

03:24.272 --> 03:26.640
- No, official-official.

[camera clicks]

03:31.645 --> 03:33.381

03:46.794 --> 03:48.429
Post.

03:48.462 --> 03:50.664
Oh, no.

03:50.698 --> 03:53.301
Lex, the Wi-Fi must be down.

03:53.301 --> 03:54.768
- Cell service too.

03:54.802 --> 03:58.205
Don't move.

03:58.306 --> 03:59.407
Hello, front desk?

03:59.440 --> 04:00.774
Can you tell me what's going on

04:00.808 --> 04:02.643
with the Wi-Fi
and cell phone service?

04:02.676 --> 04:06.814
We need to send an
extremely important Instagram.

04:06.847 --> 04:09.016
Down throughout the building?

04:13.987 --> 04:15.589
Dear God.

04:15.623 --> 04:18.959
We're completely cut off
from the outside world.

04:25.433 --> 04:27.835
- Carlton!
Carlton, who's that?

04:27.868 --> 04:30.938
- Oh, that was Mrs. Crisp.
12-C.

04:30.971 --> 04:33.240
- Oh, yes.

04:33.341 --> 04:35.809
The Lord finally put her
out of her long misery.

04:35.843 --> 04:38.346
- Yes, and us out of ours.

04:40.548 --> 04:41.849
- Go on.

04:41.882 --> 04:43.784
- Oh, nothing, ma'am.
It's just...

04:43.817 --> 04:46.454
when your husband's the guy
who invented non-dairy creamer,

04:46.487 --> 04:48.989
seems like at Christmas,
you can afford to tip

04:49.022 --> 04:51.258
more than
a $20 Best Buy gift card.

04:51.359 --> 04:54.027
- Oh, yes.
Yes, her husband.

04:54.061 --> 04:57.565
Oh, that poor man must
be devastated right now.

04:57.598 --> 04:58.899
Yes.

05:04.004 --> 05:06.440
- Who was that woman,

05:06.474 --> 05:08.376
and why are we going
to her house for brunch?

05:08.409 --> 05:09.877
- She definitely lives
in the building.

05:09.910 --> 05:12.380
I think she's married
to that super tall, bald guy.

05:12.380 --> 05:14.715
- The guy who looks like the
animatronic Halloween butler?

05:14.748 --> 05:16.417
No, no--he's married

05:16.450 --> 05:18.118
to the freckly lady
with the red braids.

05:18.151 --> 05:19.520
Old Pippi Longstocking.

05:19.553 --> 05:20.754
- I thought
old Pippi was a widow.

05:20.788 --> 05:22.390
Used to be married
to Asian Al Roker.

05:22.423 --> 05:23.924
- Wait, he died?
Oh, no!

05:23.957 --> 05:27.027
I loved Asian Al Roker.
- Meredith.

05:27.060 --> 05:30.898
Her name is Meredith.
She's married to Brad.

05:30.931 --> 05:33.467
- The kids weren't drunk.

05:33.501 --> 05:35.636
- Okay, kids, this is important.

05:35.669 --> 05:38.539
For reasons that you are
too young to understand,

05:38.572 --> 05:40.040
your mom and I can't remember

05:40.073 --> 05:41.675
some things that happened
last night.

05:41.709 --> 05:42.876
- You were wasted?
- Okay.

05:42.910 --> 05:44.111
Where did you learn
that word?

05:44.144 --> 05:45.746
- Mom kept saying it
over and over.

05:45.779 --> 05:49.082
"I'm so wasted.
I'm so wasted."

05:49.116 --> 05:51.652
- As in I'm so tired.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.687
Like, more tired than you guys
have ever been.

05:53.721 --> 05:55.489
- Which is why we need you
to tell us

05:55.523 --> 05:56.924
everything that happened
last night.

05:56.957 --> 05:58.426
- I brushed my teeth
for two minutes

05:58.459 --> 06:00.494
and didn't swallow
any toothpaste.

06:00.528 --> 06:02.830
- That's great, Miles,
but that's not what we mean.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.465
- Can I go to a new camp
next summer?

06:04.498 --> 06:06.700
- Kids! Focus!
Last night!

06:06.734 --> 06:08.702
- You ran out of wine,
and you went to get more,

06:08.736 --> 06:11.271
and when you came back,
we had new best friends.

06:12.973 --> 06:14.542
- God, I needed this.

06:14.575 --> 06:16.109
No offense to that therapist,

06:16.143 --> 06:18.579
but she ain't got nothin'
on Dr. Cabernet.

06:18.612 --> 06:20.714
- So what if Miles
is a little pain in the ass?

06:20.748 --> 06:22.516
What kid isn't?

06:22.550 --> 06:24.618
If he were a little cuter,
they'd call him precocious.

06:24.652 --> 06:26.086
- Totally.

06:26.119 --> 06:28.889
I was beginning to feel like
we were a family of nutjobs.

06:28.922 --> 06:31.091
Hey, let's make a pact--
at least for tonight,

06:31.124 --> 06:33.193
we forget all about it.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.795
- Deal.

06:36.163 --> 06:37.998
[sighs]

06:38.031 --> 06:40.601
Voila.

06:40.634 --> 06:43.070
- Boo.

06:43.103 --> 06:45.639
Open another.
- That's our last bottle.

06:45.673 --> 06:47.641
- What?
Oh, no, no.

06:47.675 --> 06:49.677
We're not going through
a blizzard with no wine.

06:49.710 --> 06:51.945
We've gotta get some; there's
gotta be some in the building.

06:51.979 --> 06:53.547
I'm going door to door.

06:53.581 --> 06:56.149
- We are profoundly bad parents.

06:56.183 --> 06:59.286
- Can Alice and Fanny sleep over
again tonight?

06:59.319 --> 07:01.288
- Who the hell
are Alice and Fanny?

07:01.321 --> 07:03.924
[phone ringing]
The landline.

07:06.126 --> 07:07.294
Hello?

07:07.327 --> 07:09.029
- Hey, me again.

07:09.062 --> 07:10.998
Also, could you guys bring
some maple syrup?

07:11.031 --> 07:12.966
Fanny says we're out,
and believe me, she'd know.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.769
She drinks it.
All right, thanks.

07:15.803 --> 07:17.705
- Guys, I think

07:23.110 --> 07:23.611
- Whoo!
- There they go.

07:25.145 --> 07:26.346
- So, I mean,
would I ever do that?

07:26.379 --> 07:28.148
- Never.
- Right.

07:28.181 --> 07:30.183
It's like that thing you said
about elephant seals.

07:30.217 --> 07:31.785
- Mm.
- That was so great.

07:31.819 --> 07:34.788
- Oh! Vermont!

07:34.822 --> 07:36.156
How fitting!

07:36.189 --> 07:38.058
- We thought
you'd appreciate that.

07:38.091 --> 07:40.761
- Vermont. What a state.
- Isn't it amazing?

07:40.794 --> 07:42.630
All of us living
in the same building for so long

07:42.663 --> 07:44.397
and we never met?
- It actually seems impossible.

07:44.431 --> 07:46.166
- It's a shame.
- Incredible.

07:46.199 --> 07:48.168
- And to think that you and I
were both going through

07:48.201 --> 07:50.103
those miscarriages
at the same time.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.640
We could have gone through that
together.

07:52.673 --> 07:54.808
- Right.

07:54.842 --> 07:56.777
Do you guys smell something?

07:56.810 --> 07:58.979
There's--agh!
Fire!

07:59.012 --> 08:01.048
- Get the zapper.
- I'm on it.

08:01.081 --> 08:03.884
- [shrieking]

08:03.917 --> 08:05.853
[whooshing]

08:05.886 --> 08:08.088
Holy shit.
- Owen.

08:08.121 --> 08:09.456
Owen.
- Owen!

08:09.557 --> 08:11.124
- Come out from there.

08:11.158 --> 08:14.394
[whooshing]

08:14.427 --> 08:17.130
- Hand 'em over.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.399
Now apologize to Jill.

08:19.432 --> 08:21.268
- I'm sorry I lit you on fire.

08:21.301 --> 08:22.903
- That's...okay.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.039
- Go play.

08:27.407 --> 08:28.876
I'm so sorry.

08:28.909 --> 08:31.111
He only does that
to people he likes,

08:31.144 --> 08:32.379
for what it's worth.

08:32.412 --> 08:33.781
I'm mortified.

08:33.814 --> 08:36.183
- Hey, every kid's
got something.

08:36.216 --> 08:39.753
- Totally--we've had endless
trouble with Miles this year.

08:39.787 --> 08:41.088
- We know.

08:41.121 --> 08:42.823
That therapist
you were telling us about

08:42.856 --> 08:44.157
sounds terrible.

08:44.191 --> 08:45.926
- Yeah, don't take this
the wrong way,

08:45.959 --> 08:47.895
but Mere and I were just saying
what a relief it was

08:47.928 --> 08:49.496
to hear we weren't
the only ones.

08:49.597 --> 08:53.200
Sometimes, we feel like we're
a family of crazies, you know?

08:53.233 --> 08:55.903
- Yes.
- You are not crazy.

08:55.936 --> 08:57.971
And by the way,
a six-year-old lighting matches?

08:58.005 --> 08:59.807
Talk about fine motor skills.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.341
- One way to look at it.
[laughing]

09:01.374 --> 09:03.944
- Can I just say,
these waffles are ridic.

09:03.977 --> 09:05.278
So good.
- Thank you.

09:05.312 --> 09:06.947
It's my mom's recipe.

09:06.980 --> 09:09.316
The secret ingredient is
I opened a box of Bisquick.

09:09.349 --> 09:11.384
[laughter]

09:11.418 --> 09:13.954
- Andy, we found people
who actually chow

09:13.987 --> 09:15.623
right in our building!
- Yeah!

09:15.623 --> 09:18.191
- Can we get together every
weekend and eat our feelings?

09:18.225 --> 09:21.228
- Yeah!
- Yes, I'm so in!

09:21.261 --> 09:23.296
I love eating my feelings.

09:26.967 --> 09:29.937
- Mrs. Von Weber,
What a lovely surprise.

09:29.970 --> 09:31.639
- Oh, Timberly,
you poor dear.

09:31.639 --> 09:34.341
It's just awful.
I can't believe she's gone.

09:34.374 --> 09:35.643
- Were you and Eloise close?

09:35.643 --> 09:37.010
- No, not at all.

09:37.044 --> 09:38.445
But I do know what it's like

09:38.478 --> 09:40.648
to be suddenly all alone
in a triplex.

09:40.681 --> 09:42.916
Might you care for some company?

09:42.950 --> 09:46.086
Some...companionship?

09:47.420 --> 09:50.490
- I must be the luckiest widower
in the world.

09:58.265 --> 10:02.035
- Thelma!
Phoebe.

10:02.069 --> 10:04.905
- Come, join the party.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.506
[ice cubes rattling]

10:08.308 --> 10:10.110
- Room service, please.

10:10.143 --> 10:12.946
For the lady, a Pellegrino
with a wedge of Meyer lemon.

10:12.980 --> 10:15.115
- You remembered.
- And for me--

10:15.148 --> 10:18.085
I'm sorry, what?

10:18.118 --> 10:22.322
I see.
Bye, then.

10:22.355 --> 10:23.957
- What happened?

10:23.991 --> 10:27.027
- The snow--none of the workers
can get in.

10:27.060 --> 10:28.461
[scoffs]
I thought they lived here.

10:28.495 --> 10:31.631
Room service is unavailable,
but we are--get this--

10:31.665 --> 10:34.301
welcome to come get it
ourselves.

10:34.334 --> 10:36.603
- What does that even mean?
- I don't know.

10:36.636 --> 10:39.339
Take the elevator
and push the big cart?

10:39.372 --> 10:42.242
- This storm is turning into
a living nightmare.

10:42.275 --> 10:44.177
[sighs]

10:44.211 --> 10:46.013
Nothing but simple carbs.

10:46.046 --> 10:49.082
I'd rather starve than get fat.
- Calm down!

10:49.116 --> 10:51.051
Shit's getting real,
but we'll get through this.

10:51.084 --> 10:52.519
- Don't tell me to calm down!

10:52.552 --> 10:54.688
I am never gonna get
my Meyer lemon water.

10:54.722 --> 10:56.589
- I'll figure something out,
Brooke.

10:56.623 --> 10:59.126
Have I ever let you down?

10:59.159 --> 11:01.328
- [scoffs]
I can think of one time.

11:05.265 --> 11:08.568
- Okay, I thought were were
letting go of the past

11:08.601 --> 11:11.638
and taking ownership
of what happened.

11:11.739 --> 11:15.108
- Oh, so it was my fault!
- That's not what I said.

11:15.142 --> 11:17.110
But it didn't happen
in a vacuum.

11:21.214 --> 11:23.283
Don't do something
you're gonna regret.

11:23.316 --> 11:24.785
Brooke--

11:30.190 --> 11:31.324
This isn't you, Brooke.

11:31.358 --> 11:32.793
- [shuddery breath]

11:38.165 --> 11:40.400
- Yeah, I mean, every morning,
at least one of them is in tears

11:40.433 --> 11:42.435
because Daddy's taking them
to school and not me.

11:42.469 --> 11:44.271
It's a stake
through Andy's heart.

11:44.304 --> 11:46.539
- I know, it's the same
for Brad, and I just tell him,

11:46.573 --> 11:49.476
"Don't worry, it's a phase."
- Exactly.

11:49.509 --> 11:52.012
But just once,
I'd like one of them to say,

11:52.045 --> 11:54.514
"I want Daddy to wipe me."

11:54.547 --> 11:57.785
- I know,
you know, but...

11:57.785 --> 12:00.553
I secretly love
being the favorite.

12:00.587 --> 12:03.390
When Fanny was three,
she was such a daddy's girl--

12:03.423 --> 12:05.192
it was like they were lovers.

12:05.225 --> 12:06.860
And I admit it--
I was jealous.

12:06.894 --> 12:10.230
So I turned her against him.

12:10.263 --> 12:11.899
- Sorry--
how?

12:11.932 --> 12:13.333
- Little things at first,

12:13.366 --> 12:15.936
like have him take her
to get her shots

12:15.969 --> 12:18.906
and accidentally tell him
the wrong pick-up time,

12:18.939 --> 12:21.408
and then I finally just said,

12:21.441 --> 12:23.911
"Listen, honey,
Daddy loves Owen more."

12:23.944 --> 12:25.813
It took about a year.

12:25.813 --> 12:27.547
- It's been rough, honestly.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.516
At work, all you have
is one person to worry about.

12:29.549 --> 12:31.184
At home, I'm fourth or fifth
on the list.

12:31.218 --> 12:32.585
- So true;
it's no fun

12:32.619 --> 12:34.554
being out of work,
even for a couple months.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.689
- Well, I'm technically not
out of work.

12:36.723 --> 12:39.692
- Brad, honey, it's not
a couple months, it's 6 1/2.

12:39.726 --> 12:42.830
- Thank you for keeping
such close track, dear.

12:42.830 --> 12:44.932
Here's a wild idea:
why don't you go back to work?

12:44.965 --> 12:47.234
She used to be a copy editor,
back in the day.

12:47.267 --> 12:50.603
- I was, but I made
the selfish choice

12:50.637 --> 12:54.707
of staying home to raise
our children, so my bad!

12:54.741 --> 12:55.909
Forgive me!

12:55.943 --> 12:57.845
At least I get out of my
sweatpants

12:57.845 --> 12:58.846
more than once a week.

12:58.846 --> 13:00.213
This is, like,

13:00.247 --> 13:02.015
the most dressed-up
you will ever see him.

13:02.049 --> 13:04.051
- Yeah, well, I don't know
who she's dressing up for.

13:04.084 --> 13:07.454
- Not you--I get more sexual
energy off the fruit vendor.

13:07.487 --> 13:09.322
- Well, good--why don't you
let him hunker down

13:09.356 --> 13:10.991
with your eight hours
of night gas, then?

13:11.024 --> 13:13.894
- I just have a question
about that garlic spray.

13:13.927 --> 13:16.329
Is that something you cook with?

13:16.363 --> 13:18.598
- Oh. No.
- No. No, no, no.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.934
This is something you spray
on your kid's scalps.

13:20.968 --> 13:23.536
It's supposed to prevent lice.
I think it's bullshit.

13:23.570 --> 13:25.873
- Yeah, well, so is lice.

13:25.873 --> 13:30.010
I mean, people act like it is
just the most devastating

13:30.043 --> 13:31.912
apocalypse on the planet.

13:31.945 --> 13:34.714
I had a girlfriend who spent
thousands of dollars

13:34.747 --> 13:36.683
de-lousing her kids,
fumigating her house,

13:36.716 --> 13:40.353
throwing out the brushes and
the hats and the blabbity-blah--

13:40.387 --> 13:41.588
It's like, who cares?
It's lice!

13:41.621 --> 13:42.990
- [laughs]

13:43.023 --> 13:45.492
- But your kids don't have lice
now, right?

13:45.525 --> 13:48.328
- No, they did--
well--

13:48.361 --> 13:50.030
Fanny has eggs in her scalp.

13:50.063 --> 13:53.100
She got sent home from school
with, like, a neon-green note,

13:53.133 --> 13:54.935
like she was radioactive.

13:54.968 --> 13:56.603
- So what'd you--
what'd you do about it?

13:56.636 --> 13:58.571
- Oh, you know, these things
work themselves out.

13:58.605 --> 14:01.108
Lice aren't killing people.
- He's exaggerating.

14:01.141 --> 14:03.776
We bought the shampoo
and we're gonna use it.

14:03.810 --> 14:05.178
We just haven't had a minute.

14:05.212 --> 14:07.114
- Okay, um, look at the time!

14:07.147 --> 14:09.116
We have totally overstayed
our welcome.

14:09.149 --> 14:10.918
Kids!
- Kids!

14:10.951 --> 14:14.187
- Kids! Thank you so much.
- What about our bloody marys?

14:14.221 --> 14:15.989
- Take that off.
Take those off.

14:16.023 --> 14:17.190
[all shouting]
- Say thank you!

14:17.224 --> 14:19.993
Thank you for having us.
- Okay.

14:20.027 --> 14:21.761
- We'll be in touch with you
about the house!

14:21.794 --> 14:23.096
- House?

14:27.935 --> 14:28.368
- Okay, here we go.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.605
"If you've come into contact
with contaminated hair"--

14:32.639 --> 14:35.075
Okay, kids, I want you
to take off all your clothes

14:35.108 --> 14:36.776
and chuck them in the dryer now!

14:36.809 --> 14:38.711
- Here it is.
The booking confirmation.

14:38.745 --> 14:41.949
Winter cottage rental
in Burlington, Vermont.

14:41.982 --> 14:44.451
- Vermont!
That's why the syrup!

14:44.484 --> 14:46.653
- What have we done?
We just met these people,

14:46.686 --> 14:48.455
and we agreed to
a three-month house-share?

14:48.488 --> 14:49.856
- And she was wearing my socks.

14:49.957 --> 14:51.191
What if I have body lice?

14:51.224 --> 14:52.592
We have to break up
with them.

14:52.625 --> 14:53.826
- How?
They live in the building.

14:53.860 --> 14:55.095
- We'll move.
- What?

14:55.128 --> 14:56.863
- Sell the apartment
and move far, far away.

14:56.964 --> 14:58.565
It's the only way out of this!

14:58.598 --> 15:00.500
- What if we tell them
we just found out

15:00.533 --> 15:02.802
your mother is coming to visit
and we can't leave her alone?

15:02.835 --> 15:04.537
- That's so dumb,
it's insulting.

15:04.571 --> 15:07.340
- We have to do something!
We hooked up with nutjobs!

15:10.310 --> 15:12.312
- I've done a lot of growing,
you know.

15:12.345 --> 15:14.647
- Me too.
I've grown a ton.

15:14.681 --> 15:15.983
- I've changed.

15:15.983 --> 15:17.250
- I think I've changed more.

15:17.284 --> 15:18.986
I'm a completely different
person.

15:18.986 --> 15:22.189
- Okay, fine.
We've both evolved equally.

15:22.222 --> 15:25.158
So what do we do about it?

15:25.192 --> 15:28.295
- In my now-extensive
business experience,

15:28.328 --> 15:29.862
I've found
it's beneficial

15:29.896 --> 15:32.565
to set expectations
in advance in writing.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.101
- You want to draw up
a contract?

15:34.134 --> 15:37.204
- No.
A vision board.

15:37.237 --> 15:39.006
Let's put it all up here.

15:39.039 --> 15:41.008
All our hopes, dreams,

15:41.008 --> 15:42.675
prospective vacation
destinations.

15:42.709 --> 15:44.577
- Should you be drawing
on the wall in Sharpie?

15:44.611 --> 15:45.878
- I'll start.

15:45.912 --> 15:47.847
My fondest wish
for this relationship

15:47.880 --> 15:49.816
is that you never betray
my trust.

15:49.849 --> 15:51.218
Or what remains of it.

15:51.251 --> 15:53.053
- This is what
I'm talking about.

15:53.086 --> 15:54.754
If we're going to have
a future together,

15:54.787 --> 15:57.324
you have to find a way
to forgive me.

15:57.357 --> 15:59.259
- I have forgiven you.

15:59.292 --> 16:01.694
And now all I ask is the right
to lord it over you

16:01.728 --> 16:03.030
for the rest of your life.

16:03.030 --> 16:06.066
- I can't do this.

16:06.099 --> 16:07.700
- Where are you going?

16:07.734 --> 16:09.702
- For a walk in the snow.

16:09.736 --> 16:11.804
It's gotta be warmer out there.

16:11.838 --> 16:13.206
- [exhales angrily]

16:21.181 --> 16:25.152
- Jesus, it's the Superdome
in here.

16:32.192 --> 16:33.926
- Hey, Vaness,
we need your advice.

16:33.960 --> 16:36.129
We had a one-night stand
with this family

16:36.163 --> 16:37.764
and we need to cut it off.

16:37.797 --> 16:39.732
- What?
- You've dumped tons of guys.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.134
What do we do?

16:41.168 --> 16:42.769
- Okay, has there been
any contact since?

16:42.802 --> 16:44.237
- Yes, and we traded clothes,

16:44.271 --> 16:45.938
and we're doing a house-share
with them.

16:45.972 --> 16:49.242
- [laughs]
Wow! You guys are easy.

16:49.276 --> 16:51.744
How 'bout you say you're not
ready for anything serious,

16:51.778 --> 16:52.779
you'd rather stay friends.

16:52.812 --> 16:54.781
- No, we need to kill this dead.

16:54.814 --> 16:57.950
I never want
to see these people again.

16:59.252 --> 17:00.920
- And one more.

17:01.088 --> 17:02.955
To our dear friend, Timberly.

17:02.989 --> 17:06.393
- Really, Candace, haven't you
quite had enough?

17:06.426 --> 17:07.927
- If you can't keep up,

17:07.960 --> 17:10.130
grab a couch like the other one,
sister.

17:10.163 --> 17:11.798
- What a treat this has been,

17:11.831 --> 17:15.102
in the company
of such elegant beauties.

17:15.102 --> 17:17.270
- Yes, though it is funny.

17:17.304 --> 17:22.109
Where I come from, we don't put
on our big jewelry until 8:00.

17:22.109 --> 17:26.513
- Oh, darling, whoever said
this was my big jewelry?

17:26.546 --> 17:28.215
Bottom's up.

17:40.127 --> 17:41.428
[glass shatters]

17:43.130 --> 17:46.533
And then there was Candace.

17:46.566 --> 17:49.136
[doorbell rings]

17:49.136 --> 17:50.537
- Hey!
- Hey! Hi!

17:50.570 --> 17:53.140
Us again.
Um...so listen.

17:53.140 --> 17:56.309
Jill and I have been talking
about the Vermont house

17:56.343 --> 17:58.311
and so want to do it,
but the truth is--

17:58.345 --> 18:00.313
is my back and skiing
do not mix.

18:00.347 --> 18:02.149
We're talking traction.
- No worries!

18:02.182 --> 18:04.151
That's why we sprung
for the house with the hot tub.

18:04.184 --> 18:05.385
- Well, also the traffic.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.053
You know, Vermont sounds fun
in theory,

18:07.154 --> 18:08.355
but after five hours
on the road...

18:08.388 --> 18:09.989
- Don't worry,
JetBlue just added

18:10.022 --> 18:12.292
service to Burlington
for 90 bucks.

18:12.325 --> 18:14.361
You can't beat it.
- It'll be cramped.

18:14.394 --> 18:16.929
- Six bedrooms.
- What if there's no snow?

18:16.963 --> 18:18.665
- Then we'll hike!
- Here's the thing, okay?

18:18.698 --> 18:21.201
We moved too fast;
we live too close.

18:21.234 --> 18:22.635
We're afraid
this won't end well.

18:22.669 --> 18:25.071
- It's nothing personal.

18:25.172 --> 18:26.706
- But lice is disguitious!

18:26.739 --> 18:29.976
We've had it, it sucks,
but it's not a pulled muscle

18:30.009 --> 18:31.678
that just works itself out.

18:31.711 --> 18:33.246
You have to deal with it!

18:36.048 --> 18:38.050
- Oh.
- Wow.

18:38.084 --> 18:41.454
- We just thought you guys
were cooler about things.

18:41.488 --> 18:43.089
- Ding! Ding!

18:43.190 --> 18:45.392
Oh, excuse me.
I just received an email.

18:45.425 --> 18:47.560
Oh, it's my mother.
She's visiting this winter.

18:47.594 --> 18:49.262
We can't go to Vermont anyway,
so...

18:49.296 --> 18:51.564
- Oh, yeah, too bad.
I guess it's not gonna work out.

18:51.598 --> 18:53.300
We'll see you around, yeah?

18:58.205 --> 18:58.505
[door opens]

19:00.039 --> 19:01.741
- Who is it?

19:01.774 --> 19:04.677
I've got the activity binder,
and I know how to use it!

19:06.413 --> 19:08.348
Lex.

19:08.381 --> 19:10.217
Thank God you're alive.

19:15.121 --> 19:19.226
What is that?
Some kind of non-Meyer lemon?

19:19.226 --> 19:23.230
- I think they call it
a...lemon.

19:23.263 --> 19:25.232
- [chuckles]

19:25.232 --> 19:27.234
You came through for me.

19:27.234 --> 19:29.236
That's all that matters.

19:29.236 --> 19:32.472
Everything else,
we can work through or ignore.

19:36.142 --> 19:39.379
- Wait, wait.
Has there been a maid in here?

19:39.412 --> 19:42.649
- No, I did it.
All by myself.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.784
See how much I've changed?

19:44.817 --> 19:47.153
- Come here, you.

19:50.623 --> 19:52.325
- Did you hear that?

19:52.359 --> 19:54.361
- What?
- A noise downstairs.

19:54.394 --> 19:57.264
- [laughs]
- I'll suss it out.

19:57.264 --> 19:59.131
- Oh, yes.

19:59.165 --> 20:00.767
Yes, you go suss it out.

20:00.800 --> 20:04.170
[laughing]

20:04.203 --> 20:07.173
Yeah, you suss out--
[gasps]

20:07.206 --> 20:10.209
[moaning and panting]

20:11.478 --> 20:14.714
- [snoring]
- Timberly?

20:14.747 --> 20:16.849
Timberly?

20:16.883 --> 20:19.452
Oh, Jesus, God.

20:19.486 --> 20:21.921
Oh...

20:23.356 --> 20:25.258
Yeah, okay.

20:25.292 --> 20:28.227
Oh, that's...
mm-hmm, that's just fine.

20:28.261 --> 20:29.829
[exhales]

20:29.862 --> 20:31.664
Oh, yeah.

20:31.698 --> 20:33.333
Oh, baby.

20:33.366 --> 20:35.835
Oh, you just keep snoring,
honey.

20:35.868 --> 20:37.770
Just keep snoring away.

20:37.804 --> 20:39.672
[gasps]
Ooh, good boy.

20:43.310 --> 20:45.545
- I think we've learned
a valuable lesson.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.414
- Don't talk to neighbors.

20:47.447 --> 20:49.549
- I am never drinking again.

20:49.582 --> 20:50.750
- Never.

20:50.783 --> 20:52.519
Want some wine?

20:52.552 --> 20:54.754
- Little bit.

20:54.787 --> 20:56.789
- So babe, I've been thinking,

20:56.823 --> 21:00.460
it may not be the worst thing
in the world if you...

21:00.493 --> 21:01.728
- I went back to work early?

21:01.761 --> 21:03.563
I already emailed the board.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.832
[both giggle]

21:05.865 --> 21:08.335
- We miss you already.

21:10.503 --> 21:12.439
[doorbell rings]

21:12.472 --> 21:14.374
- [sighs]
What do you want, Jill?

21:14.407 --> 21:15.608
- Hi, sorry to bother you.

21:15.642 --> 21:16.976
I just wanted
to return your pig.

21:17.009 --> 21:18.511
[pig grunts]

21:18.545 --> 21:20.347
- Yeah, but that's not our pig.

21:22.882 --> 21:25.852
- For more "Odd Mom Out,"

21:25.885 --> 21:27.887
[seagull squawking]
- Oh, dear.

21:29.822 --> 21:31.524
- Left, right,
left, right, left, right!
