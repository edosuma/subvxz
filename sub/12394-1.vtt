TWO LESSONS.

FOUR DAYS AGO.

01:44.870 --> 01:46.098

AT THE POLICE STATION, RIGHT?

01:48.900 --> 01:50.731
SO WE ASSUMED
THAT WE'D GET MORE CASES.

- WE'RE NOT SURE WHAT THE DEAL
WITH THE WRAPPING

10:57.850 --> 10:58.680
ON THE HAND IS.

10:58.720 --> 11:00.756
AND HE--HE LEAPT A WALL
INTO THE CROWD,

11:00.790 --> 11:01.882
SO HE'S ATHLETIC.

11:01.920 --> 11:03.854
KEPT HIS FACE COVERED
THE WHOLE TIME.

11:03.890 --> 11:05.824
COULDN'T GET
A CLEAR SHOT OF HIM.

11:05.860 --> 11:07.225
IT'S ALMOST AS IF HE KNEW
THERE WERE CAMERAS THERE.

11:07.260 --> 11:08.727
- CARLTON,
I HAVE A LOT OF WORK

11:08.760 --> 11:10.125
TO DO HERE,
SO IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND--

11:10.170 --> 11:12.695
- OH, MY GOD,
WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE.

11:12.740 --> 11:14.992
YOU WERE TRYING TO LURE HER
OUT OF THIS DUNGEON

11:15.040 --> 11:16.393
BY USING DETAILS
FROM THE CASE.

11:16.440 --> 11:18.806
- I AM NOT.
- SEE, IT'S NOT JUST ME.

11:18.840 --> 11:21.707
YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT HER
INSISTING ON STAYING DOWN HERE--

11:21.740 --> 11:23.298
THE UNRETURNED PHONE CALLS

11:23.350 --> 11:26.103
AND THE EVER-SO-SLIGHT DARKENING
OF THE HAIR.

11:26.150 --> 11:27.344
- I HADN'T NOTICED.

11:27.380 --> 11:29.314
- I LIKE IT.
- THANK YOU, GUS.

11:29.350 --> 11:33.286
NOW, WOULD YOU GUYS
PLEASE JUST LEAVE ME ALONE?

11:33.320 --> 11:36.289
- WAY TO GO, SPENCER.
YOU ARE NOT ON THIS CASE.

11:36.320 --> 11:39.323
- WHAT? LASSIE, WE'VE CLEARLY
CROSSED A THRESHOLD.

11:39.360 --> 11:41.157
TOMORROW WE SHOULD WEAR
MATCHING JUMPSUITS--

11:41.200 --> 11:42.792
NAY, T-SHIRTS.

11:42.830 --> 11:46.732
I'LL BE THING ONE.
YOU BE THING TWO.

11:46.770 --> 11:47.964
- EXCUSE ME.
- WAIT.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.831
BEFORE YOU GO,
ONE QUESTION--

11:49.870 --> 11:51.735
WHO WOULD COUNTERFEIT
A 50-CENT PIECE,

11:51.770 --> 11:54.978
HONK KONG, 978 DYNASTY?
- 1978.

11:55.010 --> 11:56.944
- OOH, THAT MAKES
SO MUCH MORE SENSE.

11:56.980 --> 11:59.278
- YOU CAN'T SERIOUSLY TELL ME
YOU THINK THE TRIADS

11:59.310 --> 12:00.447
ARE INVOLVED IN THIS?
- TRIADS?

12:00.480 --> 12:02.072
- ATHLETES.
- CHINESE GANGS.

12:02.120 --> 12:04.418
- ATHLETIC GANGS
OF CHINESE MEN.

12:04.450 --> 12:05.519
- VERY SERIOUS GANGS.

12:05.550 --> 12:07.484
- HOW DO WE SPEAK
WITH THESE TRIADS?

12:07.520 --> 12:09.750
- YOU DON'T SPEAK WITH THEM.
THEY'RE AN UNDERGROUND SOCIETY.

12:09.790 --> 12:10.950
- YOU'RE SAYING I NEED
TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT.

12:10.990 --> 12:12.355
- SPENCER, LOOK,
THERE ARE DIFFERENT GANGS

12:12.390 --> 12:13.527
WITHIN THE TRIADS.
WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

12:13.560 --> 12:15.096
ARE WE TALKING
ABOUT THE GOLDEN TRIAD,

12:15.130 --> 12:16.825
THE DRAGON TRIAD?
- REGULAR.

12:16.870 --> 12:18.826
I THINK WE'RE PRIMARILY
INTERESTED IN MEDIUM.

12:18.870 --> 12:20.462
VENTI.
- VENTI IS LARGE.

12:20.500 --> 12:23.037
- WELL, THEN NOT VENTI.
WE'LL SPEAK WITH BOTH GANGS.

12:23.070 --> 12:25.538
- NO. SPENCER, YOU WILL STAY
AWAY FROM THESE PEOPLE.

12:25.570 --> 12:27.777
THEY ARE
LEGITIMATELY DANGEROUS,

12:27.810 --> 12:29.368
AND THOSE TWO GANGS HAVE BEEN
ON THE VERGE OF WAR FOR YEARS.

12:29.410 --> 12:31.799
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
THE FREE INFORMATION TRAIN

12:31.850 --> 12:33.772
HAS LEFI' THE STATION.

12:33.820 --> 12:35.378
YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO FIGURE IT
ALL OUT FOR YOURSELF.

12:35.420 --> 12:38.480
- PLEASE.
LIKE WE CAN'T DO THAT.

12:39.820 --> 12:41.219
- WE NEED INFORMATION.
- WHOA, WAIT.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.888
YOU GUYS AREN'T HERE TO PAY ME
FOR MY LAST DAY?

12:43.930 --> 12:45.852
- I BELIEVE I DID PAY YOU.
- WE DIDN'T PAY HIM ANYTHING.

12:45.890 --> 12:48.393
- WE PAID HIM IN GRATITUDE
AND LIFE LESSONS.

12:48.430 --> 12:50.421
- I KNEW I SHOULDN'T HAVE OPENED
THIS DOOR.

12:50.470 --> 12:51.823
- KEN, DON'T THINK OF IT

12:51.870 --> 12:53.337
AS NOT BEING PAID
FOR YOUR LAST DAY.

12:53.370 --> 12:55.395
THINK OF IT
AS A SURPRISE TWO-YEAR VACATION.

12:55.440 --> 12:56.862
- UNPAID.
- WE WILL HIRE YOU BACK.

12:56.910 --> 12:59.037
- SOMEDAY.
- PROBABLY NOT SOON, THOUGH.

12:59.070 --> 13:01.436
- WHY ARE YOU GUYS HERE?

13:01.480 --> 13:04.347
- WE NEED INFORMATION ON
COUNTERFEITING HONG KONG COINS.

13:04.380 --> 13:05.506
- AND THE CHINESE MAFIA.

13:05.550 --> 13:07.074
- AND WE NEED YOU TO EXPLAIN
THE ENDING

13:07.120 --> 13:08.519
OF CROUCHING TIGER,
HIDDEN DRAGON TO US.

13:08.550 --> 13:10.381
- WHAT?

13:10.420 --> 13:12.217
YOU GUYS THINK
THAT 'CAUSE I'M ASIAN,

13:12.250 --> 13:13.512
I'M SUPPOSED TO KNOW
ALL THIS STUFF.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.312
THAT'S BORDERLINE RACIST, MAN.

13:15.360 --> 13:17.487
- NO.
- RACIST. NO, I HARDLY THINK SO.

13:17.530 --> 13:18.519
INAPPROPRIATE?
- YES.

13:18.560 --> 13:19.527
- INSULTING?
- SURE.

13:19.560 --> 13:20.925
- STEREOTYPING?
- SURE.

13:20.960 --> 13:22.097
- NOT RACIST.
- MAYBE A LITTLE RACIST.

13:22.130 --> 13:23.222
- GUS, PLEASE.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.226
NOW, KEN,

13:25.270 --> 13:27.966
HOW MANY TRIADS DO YOU KNOW,
AND/OR ARE YOU ONE OF THEM?

13:28.000 --> 13:29.592
- WOW.
- OKAY, THAT DEFINITELY CROSSED

13:29.640 --> 13:31.107
THE LINE.
- JUST TELL US WHAT YOU KNOW,

13:31.140 --> 13:35.338
AND WE WILL GET OUT
OF YOUR PARENTS' HOUSE.

13:35.380 --> 13:38.099
- OKAY, THE ONLY THING I CAN
THINK OF IS THERE'S THIS PLACE

13:38.150 --> 13:39.549
WHERE THE GOLDEN TRIADS
USED TO HANG OUT.

13:39.580 --> 13:41.616
OKAY, AND THE ONLY REASON
I KNOW THAT

13:41.650 --> 13:44.983
IS BECAUSE MY MOTHER
USED TO FORBID ME TO GO THERE.

13:51.430 --> 13:54.126
- GUS, ALL I'M SAYING
IS THAT SOMETIMES

13:54.160 --> 13:55.855
YOUR JOKES DON'T LAND.

13:55.900 --> 13:58.562
- OKAY, SHAWN, YOU WANT TO
IMPOSE SOME RESTRICTIONS ON ME,

13:58.600 --> 14:00.534
THEN I WANT TO GO
OVER SOME RULES TOO.

14:00.570 --> 14:02.094
- WHAT RULES?

14:02.140 --> 14:03.459
- IN THE PAST,
YOU'VE OFFERED ME UP

14:03.510 --> 14:04.932
AS SOME SORT
OF SACRIFICIAL LAMB

14:04.970 --> 14:06.528
TO THE SITUATION.
- NAME ONE.

14:06.570 --> 14:09.368
WAIT. NEVER MIND.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

14:09.410 --> 14:11.071
- NEW RULE--
FROM NOW ON,

14:11.110 --> 14:14.045
ANY COVER STORY OR FAKE I.D.
MUST BE RUN PAST ME

14:14.080 --> 14:15.513
AND APPROVED.
- APPROVED?

14:15.550 --> 14:17.882
- IN WRITING
THREE DAYS IN ADVANCE.

14:17.920 --> 14:19.888
- GUS, YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?
- NO, SHAWN.

14:19.920 --> 14:22.411
I NEED THE PROPER AMOUNT OF TIME
TO CONCOCT MY ALTER EGO

14:22.460 --> 14:24.280
THAT BEST COMPLEMENTS YOURS
AND THE SITUATION.

14:24.330 --> 14:25.581
- I DON'T KNOW
WHERE I'M GONNA BE LIVING

14:25.630 --> 14:27.222
IN THREE DAYS.
- THAT'S THE DEAL, SHAWN.

14:27.260 --> 14:29.490
TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT.

14:29.530 --> 14:32.499
- SO HE IS
A PHARMACEUTICAL SALESMAN

14:32.530 --> 14:35.363
WHO MOONLIGHTS
AT A PSYCHIC DETECTIVE AGENCY,

14:35.400 --> 14:38.130
AND ONCE AT CAMP,
HE WET HIS PANTS.

14:38.170 --> 14:41.139
- WATER SPLASHED ON MY PANTS.
- I'M SORRY. YOU GUYS ARE COPS?

14:41.180 --> 14:44.308
- NOPE, NOT COPS, THOUGH
SOMETIMES WE WORK WITH COPS

14:44.350 --> 14:47.911
AND OCCASIONALLY
AGAINST THEM.

14:47.950 --> 14:50.248
LOOK, IF THIS WAS SATURDAY,
I'D HAVE A MUCH BETTER STORY.

14:50.290 --> 14:52.986
RIGHT NOW ALL I WANT TO DO
IS TALK TO SOME TRIADS.

14:53.020 --> 14:55.079
- EITHER KIND.

14:55.120 --> 14:57.623
- YOU GUYS KNOW
YOU'RE GONNA GET KILLED.

15:03.500 --> 15:05.229
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

15:05.270 --> 15:06.294
WHAT WERE WE THINKING?

15:06.330 --> 15:07.558
GUS?
- YES. SEE WHAT I MEAN?

15:07.600 --> 15:09.636
- SEE WHAT YOU MEAN?
WE GOT LUCKY.

15:18.610 --> 15:20.612
- WE HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING
THIS GUY FOREVER.

15:20.650 --> 15:22.049
IF HE'S A TRIAD,

15:22.080 --> 15:24.014
HE IS THE MOST BORING
GANG MEMBER OF ALL TIME.

15:24.050 --> 15:26.018
I THINK KEN GAVE US A FAKE LEAD
TO PAY YOU BACK

15:26.050 --> 15:27.483
FOR ASKING HIM
FOR A LOAN.

15:27.520 --> 15:29.215
- IT WAS A SHORT-TERM LOAN, GUS,
WITH INTEREST.

15:29.260 --> 15:31.626
- THE INTEREST
WAS LIFE LESSONS, SHAWN.

15:35.060 --> 15:37.961
- WHOA.
THOSE ARE SOME HEAW FIREARMS.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.592
SOMETHING'S GOING DOWN.

15:39.630 --> 15:42.360
RUN BACK TO THE PSYCH OFFICE,
GRAB OUR NINJA COSTUMES.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.300
- HOW COULD THAT
POSSIBLY HELP US?

15:44.340 --> 15:46.661
- WE'LL NEED TO GET CLOSER.
- NO, WE ARE STAYING HERE.

15:46.710 --> 15:48.598
- GUS, TEN SECONDS AGO,
YOU WERE COMPLAINING

15:48.640 --> 15:49.971
ABOUT BEING BORED.

15:50.010 --> 15:51.341
NOW, SUDDENLY,
IT'S TOO EXCITING?

15:51.380 --> 15:52.574
IT'D BE GREAT TO GET
SOME CONSISTENCY

15:52.610 --> 15:54.248
FROM YOU EMOTIONALLY.

15:54.280 --> 15:55.577
- SHAWN, IF SOMETHING ILLEGAL
IS GOING ON,

15:55.620 --> 15:56.575
THEN IT'S OUR DUTY
TO CALL LASSITER

15:56.620 --> 15:57.746
AND LET HIM GET SHOT.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.678
GOLDEN TRIADS CUT OFF HANDS.

15:59.720 --> 16:01.585
- ONE AT A TIME,
WHICH, TECHNICALLY,

16:01.620 --> 16:03.520
MEANS WE HAVE
FOUR OPPORTUNITIES.

16:03.560 --> 16:05.027
- I'M NOT MOVING.

16:05.060 --> 16:07.290
- THEY WON'T EVEN KNOW
WE'RE HERE.

16:07.330 --> 16:10.595
[gun cocks]

16:12.300 --> 16:14.564
I BLAME YOU.

16:14.600 --> 16:17.330
- I THINK HE SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT TAKING US TO SEE THE BOSS.

16:17.370 --> 16:19.702
- IF ONLY I HAD TIME TO SUBMIT
A FAKE IDENTITY FOR APPROVAL.

16:19.740 --> 16:21.674
- DO NOT MOCK ME WHEN I'M ABOUT
TO BE KILLED, SHAWN.

16:21.710 --> 16:23.041
- YOU KNOW I BOND
WITH AUTHORITY.

16:23.080 --> 16:24.377
THIS IS A WIN FOR US.

16:24.410 --> 16:26.071
I WILL TALK MY WAY OUT OF IT.
- HOW?

16:26.110 --> 16:27.441
- YOU KNOW
HOW MUCH I LOVE YAO MING.

16:27.480 --> 16:28.674
THAT'S GOT TO COUNT
FOR SOMETHING.

16:28.720 --> 16:31.587
- JUST LEAVE ME
OUT OF THIS.

16:33.490 --> 16:35.355
- OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,

16:35.390 --> 16:38.279
THIS IS SOME SORT
OF HUGE MISUNDERSTANDING.

16:38.330 --> 16:41.026
I KNOW AND RESPECT
THAT YOU ARE A VERY BUSY MAN.

16:41.060 --> 16:43.722
RUNNING A CRIME SYNDICATE
IS A FULL-TIME JOB.

16:43.770 --> 16:47.638
AND WE DO NOT WANT TO BOTHER YOU
ANY MORE THAN WE HAVE TO.

16:51.070 --> 16:53.209
MR. CHIANG.

16:56.680 --> 16:58.477
- I KNOW YOU.

16:58.510 --> 17:01.445
YOU'RE THE PSYCHIC
FROM THE POLICE STATION.

17:01.480 --> 17:03.516
- YES.
THAT'S CORRECT.

17:03.550 --> 17:05.381
THEY HIRED US
ON THIS CASE.

17:05.420 --> 17:07.149
- THE CHIEF SAID
THEY DID NOT.

17:07.190 --> 17:09.112
- I DON'T KNOW WHY SHE'D SAY
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

17:09.160 --> 17:10.525
- SHE SAID IT TO YOU.

17:10.560 --> 17:13.051
- YES, SHE DID.

17:13.100 --> 17:14.351
[chuckles]
CHIEF.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.527
THAT'S A LITTLE ACT WE DO
TO THROW PEOPLE OFF.

17:16.560 --> 17:17.788
- TO THROW WHO OFF?

17:17.830 --> 17:21.288
- MR. CHIANG, I FOUND THIS COIN
IN YOUR DAUGHTER'S APARTMENT.

17:21.340 --> 17:22.659
IT WAS PRETI'Y WELL HIDDEN.

17:22.700 --> 17:24.565
MY FEAR
IS THAT SHE'S MIXED UP

17:26.810 --> 17:28.607
- THIS IS MY COIN.

17:28.640 --> 17:32.770
I GAVE IT TO HER
TO SYMBOLIZE OUR PAST.

17:32.810 --> 17:35.574
NOW, I WILL SAY THIS TO YOU.

17:35.620 --> 17:39.511
AND I WILL SPEAK SLOWLY
SO YOU UNDERSTAND.

17:39.550 --> 17:41.484
SHE'S NOT MIXED UP
IN ANY OF THIS.

17:41.520 --> 17:44.785
- THIS...
CRIMINAL ACTIVITY?

17:44.830 --> 17:49.722
- WHAT YOU THINK YOU SEE HERE
IS NOT CRIMINAL.

17:49.760 --> 17:53.594
- IT SEEMS
PRETTY CRIMINAL TO ME.

17:59.370 --> 18:01.838
- OUR MISTAKE.
[chuckles nervously]

18:01.880 --> 18:04.178
IT'S JUST A HANDFUL
OF BUDDIES HANGING OUT,

18:04.210 --> 18:06.599
TAKING SOME LONG-DISTANCE
SURVEILLANCE PHOTOS

18:06.650 --> 18:09.414
AND CARRYING
SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPONS.

18:09.450 --> 18:11.714
YOU HAVE AN IDEA OF WHO TOOK
YOUR DAUGHTER, DON'T YOU?

18:11.750 --> 18:14.389
- I DO NOT.
- AND YOU WOULDN'T LIE TO ME.

18:14.420 --> 18:17.628
- YOU'RE A PSYCHIC.

18:17.660 --> 18:19.651
YOU TELL ME.

18:19.690 --> 18:21.555
- ARE WE FREE TO GO?

18:21.600 --> 18:23.659
- GO.

18:23.700 --> 18:25.691
- ALL RIGHT.

18:29.870 --> 18:32.361
THERE WAS, LIKE, A CURLICUE
THING IN THE END HERE,

18:32.410 --> 18:35.129
BUT THE WHOLE THING
KIND OF LOOKS LIKE A DRAGON.

18:35.180 --> 18:36.636
I KNOW THIS, 'CAUSE I SAW
SOMETHING LIKE IT ONCE

18:36.680 --> 18:37.442
AT A PAN DA EXPRESS.

18:37.480 --> 18:40.176
CAN YOU TELL US
WHAT IT IS OR NOT?

18:40.220 --> 18:41.676
- DUDE, MY PARENTS RUN
A BEST BUY.

18:41.720 --> 18:42.914
- I TOLD YOU.

18:42.950 --> 18:44.542
- YOU DIDN'T KNOW
ABOUT THE BEST BUY.

18:44.590 --> 18:45.887
- I TOLD YOU
HE WOULD BE OFFENDED.

18:45.920 --> 18:47.581
- HE'S NOT OFFENDED.
- I AM VERY OFFENDED.

18:47.620 --> 18:49.611
- HE'S EXCITED.
HE'S GETTING A TASTE

18:49.660 --> 18:51.252
OF THE KIND OF ACTION
THAT YOU AND I GET INTO,

18:51.290 --> 18:52.450
IF WE HADN'T HAD
TO LET HIM GO

18:52.490 --> 18:53.559
DUE TO UNFORESEEN
CIRCUMSTANCES.

18:53.600 --> 18:55.420
- GUYS.
DO YOU REALIZE

18:55.460 --> 18:56.722
THAT I'VE DONE MORE WORK
FOR YOU SINCE YOU FIRED ME?

18:56.760 --> 18:59.263
- YES, WE DO.
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS DRAGON?

18:59.300 --> 19:01.860
- YEAH, I PROBABLY SAW
SOMETHING LIKE THAT

19:01.900 --> 19:03.436
SPRAY-PAINTED ON A WALL.
- WHERE?

19:03.470 --> 19:04.869
- CHINATOWN.

19:04.910 --> 19:07.731
- WHAT?
WHERE IN CHINATOWN?

19:07.780 --> 19:12.649
- A MARTIAL ARTS STUDIO.

19:16.750 --> 19:19.639
- WHY DOES THIS HAVE ORANGE
CHICKEN SAUCE ALL OVER IT?

19:19.690 --> 19:21.954
- OH, BECAUSE IT GOT ME IN
THE MOOD FOR SOME PANDA EXPRESS.

19:21.990 --> 19:23.457
CAN YOU TELL US
WHAT THIS IS?

19:23.490 --> 19:24.650
- DRAGON TRIADS.

19:24.690 --> 19:25.725
SHAWN, WHAT DO YOU WANT
FROM ME?

19:25.760 --> 19:27.421
- THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE DOING.

19:27.460 --> 19:28.859
THEY WERE SURVEILLING
THEIR SWORN ENEMIES.

19:28.900 --> 19:30.720
- WHO WAS DOING WHAT?
- THAT DOESN'T MATTER.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.294
- IT ALSO DOESN'T MATTER
WHETHER WE WERE CAPTURED

19:32.330 --> 19:33.536
BY THESE PEOPLE OR NOT.

19:33.570 --> 19:34.867
- THE QUESTION IS,
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

19:34.900 --> 19:36.390
IF THE DRAGON TRIAD
KIDNAPPED SOMEONE

19:36.440 --> 19:37.759
FROM THE FAMILY
OF THE GOLDEN TRIAD?

19:37.810 --> 19:39.562
- THAT'S A RIDICULOUS
THEORY, SHAWN.

19:39.610 --> 19:41.237
IT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN.
- LET'S JUST SAY IT DID.

19:41.280 --> 19:42.599
- WELL, IT WOULD START OFF
A GANG WAR.

19:42.640 --> 19:44.540
IT'S BEYOND SUICIDE.
- NO, SHE'S RIGHT.

19:44.580 --> 19:46.377
THE GOLDENS AND THE DRAGONS
CAN'T EVEN BE SEEN

19:46.410 --> 19:47.570
IN EACH OTHER'S TERRITORY.

19:47.620 --> 19:51.716
- OH! I'M GONNA HAVE ALL OF YOU
BANNED FROM THIS BUILDING.

19:52.750 --> 19:54.308
- EXCUSE ME.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.555
I'M HERE FOR A CLASS.
- THIS CLASS?

19:56.590 --> 19:59.684
- YEAH, I BELIEVE IT STARTS...
- IN FIVE MINUTES.

19:59.730 --> 20:01.755
- RIGHT.
FIVE MINUTES FROM NOW.

20:01.800 --> 20:04.769
I'M USUALLY TEN MINUTES EARLY,
SO I'M ALREADY FEELING BEHIND.

20:04.800 --> 20:07.689
- THIS CLASS IS FOR FIVE-
TO EIGHT-YEAR-OLDS.

20:07.740 --> 20:09.867
- YES.
YES, IT IS.

20:09.900 --> 20:13.939
AND, UH, THAT'S
WHAT I CALL, UH...

20:13.980 --> 20:15.709
- DISCRIMINATION.

20:15.740 --> 20:17.640
- DISCRIMINATION?
- YES.

20:17.680 --> 20:19.648
AND AGEISM.
- WHO ARE YOU?

20:19.680 --> 20:21.238
- I'M HIS LAWYER.

20:21.280 --> 20:23.544
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- YOU BROUGHT A LAWYER?

20:23.590 --> 20:25.239
- I KEEP A LAWYER ON RETAINER
AT ALL TIMES.

20:25.290 --> 20:27.679
THERE IS SO MUCH INJUSTICE
IN THE WORLD

20:27.720 --> 20:29.950
THAT YOU--YOU PRACTICALLY
CAN'T LEAVE HOME WITHOUT ONE.

20:29.990 --> 20:31.685
AND APPARENTLY
TODAY IT PAID OFF.

20:31.730 --> 20:34.893
- RIGHT. OKAY, WELL,
I WILL SEE YOU IN COURT, THEN.

20:34.930 --> 20:36.557
NOW--
- PERFECT. NOW, I'LL NEED

20:36.600 --> 20:38.795
A STATEMENT FROM YOU,
AND AS WE PLAN TO TRY THIS

20:38.830 --> 20:40.468
IN BOTH CIVIL
AND CRIMINAL COURT,

20:40.500 --> 20:42.263
I'LL NEED THE POLICE HERE
AS WELL.

20:42.300 --> 20:43.801
CAN I USE YOUR PHONE?

20:43.840 --> 20:46.331
OR DO YOU ONLY LET
THE WHITE PEOPLE USE THAT?

20:46.370 --> 20:47.837
- WHO SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT WHITE PEOPLE?

20:47.880 --> 20:49.472
- YOU JUST DID.

20:49.510 --> 20:51.944
- THE WORDS "WHITE PEOPLE"
DID NOT COME OUT OF MY MOUTH.

20:51.980 --> 20:53.470
- THERE THEY ARE AGAIN.

20:53.520 --> 20:55.715
LUCKILY, I HAD MY HAND RECORDER
ON FOR THAT ONE.

20:55.750 --> 20:56.739
AND BY THE WAY,

20:56.780 --> 20:57.678
I AM NOW DISCLOSING

20:57.720 --> 20:59.585
THAT THIS CONVERSATION
IS BEING RECORDED.

20:59.620 --> 21:01.019
- RE--RECORDED?

21:01.060 --> 21:02.687
OKAY, THIS IS CRAZY.

21:02.720 --> 21:04.529
- CRAZY?
YOU WANT TO KNOW CRAZY?

21:04.560 --> 21:06.755
I SUED 300 BUSINESSES
LAST YEAR ALONE.

21:06.790 --> 21:08.826
I SUED A HOT-DOG CART
AND GOT EVERYTHING

21:08.860 --> 21:11.420
BUT THE WHEELS
AND THE BUNS,

21:11.470 --> 21:13.597
WHICH I WON IN THE CIVIL CASE
TWO MONTHS LATER.

21:13.640 --> 21:16.291
- DUDE.

21:16.340 --> 21:17.932
I THINK HE GETS IT NOW.

21:17.970 --> 21:19.631
- I KNOW,
BUT THE WORDS ARE COMING

21:19.670 --> 21:21.604
OUT OF MY MOUTH FASTER
THAN I CAN THINK OF THEM.

21:21.640 --> 21:23.471
- BRING IT HOME.

21:23.510 --> 21:25.068
- NOW, IF YOU DON'T MIND,

21:25.110 --> 21:26.805
BEFORE I START SNAPPING
EVIDENCE PHOTOS,

21:26.850 --> 21:28.010
I'M A LITTLE PARCHED.

21:28.050 --> 21:29.540
SO CAN YOU TELL ME
WHICH ONE

21:29.580 --> 21:31.548
OF THESE FOUNTAINS
I'M ALLOWED TO USE?

21:31.590 --> 21:34.616
- THAT ONE.
- [whistles]

21:34.660 --> 21:35.558
- I MEAN...

21:35.590 --> 21:39.822
Y-YOU PICK, SIR.

21:39.860 --> 21:44.661
- ONE, TWO,
THREE, FOUR,

21:44.700 --> 21:46.827
FIVE, SIX,

21:46.870 --> 21:48.690
SEVEN, EIGHT,

21:48.740 --> 21:50.708
NINE, TEN.

21:50.740 --> 21:54.801
ONE, TWO,
THREE, FOUR...

21:54.840 --> 21:57.570
all: HYAH!

21:57.610 --> 21:59.646
- OW! WHAT?
- FOCUS.

21:59.680 --> 22:02.911
- SORRY.
- YOU HAVE NO FOCUS. WHY?

22:02.950 --> 22:04.781
- I--LOOK, IT'S JUST--

22:06.620 --> 22:08.656
YOU WANT
TO KNOW THE TRUTH?

22:08.690 --> 22:10.726
MY DAD NEVER LET ME
TAKE KARATE, OKAY?

22:10.760 --> 22:12.625
- THIS IS NOT KARATE.

22:12.660 --> 22:14.821
- RIGHT. OKAY. BUT IT'S
PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THING.

22:14.860 --> 22:17.090
- NOT THE SAME THING.
- ALL RIGHT.

22:17.130 --> 22:19.064
- NOW TURN YOUR EYES AROUND
AND FOLLOW.

22:19.100 --> 22:21.091
- [exhales deeply]
- ONE...

22:21.140 --> 22:24.928
all: HYAH, HYAH,
HYAH, HYAH.

22:24.970 --> 22:27.530
HYAH, HYAH.
- HAI.

22:27.580 --> 22:30.902
AND...

22:35.050 --> 22:36.870
- DID YOU FINDYESJT ANYTHING?

22:36.920 --> 22:38.581
- WHAT?
- I'M AWESOME AT KARATE.

22:38.620 --> 22:40.042
- WUSHU.
- YEAH, YEAH, THAT.

22:40.090 --> 22:41.717
I'M AWESOME AT IT.
- YOU WERE IN THERE

22:41.760 --> 22:43.387
FOR TWO HOURS,
AND ALL YOU DID WAS KUNG FU?

22:43.430 --> 22:45.682
- NO, WE STRETCHED OUR GROINS.
WE MEDITATED.

22:45.730 --> 22:47.550
- DID YOU FIND OUT ANYTHING
ABOUT THE CASE, SHAWN?

22:47.600 --> 22:48.624
- YES.
- WHAT?

22:48.660 --> 22:49.854
- I'M PRETTY SURE UPSTAIRS

22:49.900 --> 22:51.663
IS THE HEADQUARTERS
FOR THE DRAGON TRIAD.

22:51.700 --> 22:52.962
I THINK THEY MIGHT BE HIDING
THE GIRL THERE,

22:53.000 --> 22:54.160
BUT THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT
RIGHT NOW.

22:54.200 --> 22:55.428
- NOT IMPORTANT?

22:55.470 --> 22:57.097
- GUS, I KICKED
A BOARD IN HALF.

22:57.140 --> 22:58.937
- NO, YOU DIDN'T.
- YOU'RE RIGHT. I DIDN'T.

22:58.970 --> 23:01.507
BUT IT SPLINTERED. DO YOU HAVE
ANY IDEA WHAT THIS MEANS?

23:01.540 --> 23:02.802
- IT MEANS I SAT OUTSIDE
FOR TWO HOURS

23:02.840 --> 23:04.546
WHILE YOU FULFILLED
A CHILDHOOD DREAM.

23:04.580 --> 23:05.478
- LET'S STAKE
THIS PLACE OUT TONIGHT.

23:05.510 --> 23:09.173
AND I'LL NEED $300
FOR THE INITIATION FEE.

23:09.220 --> 23:10.687
- YOU SIGNED UP FOR CLASS?

23:10.720 --> 23:12.642
THEY ARE THE BAD GUYS.
- UPSTAIRS.

23:12.690 --> 23:15.158
MASTER WU IS NOT AFFILIATED
WITH THESE HOOLIGANS.

23:24.800 --> 23:27.633
- CHIEF.
- HOW WE DOING, O'HARA?

23:27.670 --> 23:28.898
- GOOD.

23:28.940 --> 23:30.430
GREAT.
- GREAT.

23:30.470 --> 23:31.562
- GREAT.
- GREAT?

23:31.610 --> 23:35.671
- GREAT.
- GREAT.

23:35.710 --> 23:39.498
YOU KNOW, THERE'S NO SHAME
IN FEELING WHAT YOU'RE FEELING.

23:39.550 --> 23:41.518
THAT YIN CASE
IS THE KIND OF THING

23:41.550 --> 23:43.074
THAT CAN SHUT A PERSON DOWN.

23:43.120 --> 23:45.008
- YOU TOO, CHIEF?

23:45.050 --> 23:48.053
LOOK, I WILL COME BACK TO WORK
WHEN I AM READY.

23:48.090 --> 23:50.581
- I'M NOT HERE TO FORCE
YOUR HAND--JUST WANTED TO ASK.

23:50.630 --> 23:53.554
- I JUST--
THEY SAY TO TAKE SOME TIME.

23:53.600 --> 23:56.626
IT'S RECOMMENDED.
- OF COURSE.

23:56.660 --> 23:58.025
JUST MAKE SURE YOU KNOW

23:58.070 --> 24:00.766
WHEN THE HEALING ENDS
AND THE DELAYING BEGINS.

24:00.800 --> 24:02.165
- OF COURSE.

24:02.200 --> 24:03.963
I WILL.
THANK YOU.

24:04.010 --> 24:06.501
- GREAT.

24:06.540 --> 24:08.872
SO HERE YOU GO.

24:08.910 --> 24:10.639
STOPLIGHT SAFETY PROJECT.

24:10.680 --> 24:12.807
JUST TRACK AND COMPARE
EVERY LIGHT IN THE CITY,

24:12.850 --> 24:14.215
CROSS-REFERENCE
WITH EACH STOP SIGN.

24:14.250 --> 24:15.672
TELL ME IF TWO YEARS
ISN'T ENOUGH

24:15.720 --> 24:17.688
OF A SAMPLE
TO DRAW A CONCLUSION.

24:17.720 --> 24:21.816
I'LL HAVE MCNAB
BRING THE REST DOWN LATER.

24:21.860 --> 24:25.079
GOOD LUCK, O'HARA.

24:27.730 --> 24:29.755
- THAT'S IT.
I THINK THAT'S

24:29.800 --> 24:31.665
WHY MY DAD WOULDN'T LET ME TAKE
KARATE WHEN I WAS A KID, GUS,

24:31.700 --> 24:34.737
BECAUSE HE KNEW, HE KNEW
I WAS TOO GOOD, TOO DANGEROUS.

24:34.770 --> 24:36.795
ONE MOMENT, I'D BE MASTERING
THE HIGH KICK.

24:36.840 --> 24:39.661
THE NEXT, I'D BE HOLDING
A BEATING HEART IN MY HAND.

24:39.710 --> 24:41.735
- UH, SHAWN?
- WHAT?

24:46.650 --> 24:50.177
- IS THAT OUR...?
- KIDNAPPER.

24:52.790 --> 24:54.781
[whistles]

24:54.820 --> 24:56.981
ONLY ONE WAY
TO FIND OUT.

24:57.020 --> 24:58.920
THAT SECOND-FLOOR
WINDOW'S OPEN.

24:58.960 --> 25:00.757
I SAW THIS
IN A JACKIE CHAN MOVIE.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.620
WE'RE GONNA CLIMB THE BUILDING,
BOUNCING FROM WALL TO WALL.

25:02.660 --> 25:04.093
- YOU CAN'T BOUNCE
TO THE SECOND FLOOR.

25:04.130 --> 25:05.290
- EXCUSE ME.
I THINK YOU'RE NEGLECTING

25:05.330 --> 25:06.888
MY MARTIAL ARTS TRAINING.

25:06.930 --> 25:08.761
- ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
THE ONE CLASS YOU HAD TODAY?

25:08.800 --> 25:10.631
- YES, GUS, I AM.

25:10.670 --> 25:12.900
YOU KNOW WHAT?
JUST GIVE ME A BOOST.

25:12.940 --> 25:14.999
- ALL RIGHT.

25:19.080 --> 25:20.945
- WAAAH!

25:20.980 --> 25:23.744
[glass breaking]

25:23.790 --> 25:25.189
WE'RE IN.

25:50.340 --> 25:53.309
HEY, MAN, WE KNOW
YOU'RE THE KIDNAPPER.

25:53.350 --> 25:56.569
AND WE CAN DO THIS
THE EASY WAY OR THE--

25:56.620 --> 25:58.838
- YOU MUST BE OUT
OF YOUR DAMN--

26:01.260 --> 26:04.957
- AH.

26:04.990 --> 26:07.697
OH. OH.

26:07.730 --> 26:09.698
WE'RE NOT WITH THIS GUY.
- WE NEVER EVEN MET.

26:09.730 --> 26:11.698
- ACTUALLY, WE JUST--
WE JUST NOW MET HIM.

26:11.730 --> 26:13.061
- Al-TER WE BROKE IN.
- ACCIDENTALLY BROKE IN.

26:13.100 --> 26:14.692
- WE FELL THROUGH A WINDOW,

26:14.740 --> 26:15.832
WHICH TECHNICALLY
ISN'T BREAKING IN.

26:15.870 --> 26:17.235
- YEAH, AND IN OUR DEFENSE,

26:17.270 --> 26:18.760
THIS IS THE GUY
THAT'S STEALING STUFF.

26:18.810 --> 26:20.778
- YEAH, HE ALREADY HAD
THE SAFE OPEN.

26:20.810 --> 26:22.175
- WHICH HE DIDN'T HAVE TO CRACK,
WHICH MEANS HE'S A PRO.

26:22.210 --> 26:23.871
- AND HE STOLE A JACKET,
WHICH IS A WEIRD THING TO STEAL.

26:23.910 --> 26:25.639
- AGREED. ESPECIALLY SINCE
HE ALREADY HAD A SWEATSHIRT.

26:25.680 --> 26:27.739
- AND IT'S NOT EVEN
THAT COLD OUTSIDE.

26:27.780 --> 26:29.668
- SO YOU SEE, WE'RE
A COUPLE GOOD SAMARITANS.

26:29.720 --> 26:31.017
BUT DON'T WORRY.
WE DON'T EXPECT A REWARD.

26:31.050 --> 26:32.711
- SILENCE!
- LOOK, MAN, YOU DON'T GET IT!

26:32.750 --> 26:33.887
WE DON'T WANT
TO FIGHT YOU GUYS...

26:33.920 --> 26:35.785
EVEN THOUGH
WE'RE EVENLY MATCHED.

26:35.820 --> 26:37.117
- EVENLY MATCHED?
- IT'S THREE-ON-THREE.

26:37.160 --> 26:38.149
I'VE HAD MY LESSON.
YOU HAVE YOUR KARATE.

26:38.190 --> 26:39.657
- IT'S NOT KARATE, SHAWN.

26:39.690 --> 26:41.157
IT'S WUSHU.
WUSHU SOUNDS MORE AUTHENTIC.

26:41.200 --> 26:43.691
- IT SOUNDS DELICIOUS
IS WHAT IT SOUNDS.

27:02.820 --> 27:04.811
- [shouts]

27:09.960 --> 27:11.427
- I'M GOING IN.
- WHAT?

27:11.460 --> 27:13.223
- WAAAH!

27:13.260 --> 27:17.128
WAAAH!

27:33.450 --> 27:37.079
- GUS,
THOSE ARE CLEANING SUPPLIES.

27:43.990 --> 27:45.355
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST CHILL OUT

27:45.390 --> 27:47.358
AND WAIT FOR THESE GUYS
TO KILL EACH OTHER.

28:01.510 --> 28:03.432
- [grunts]

28:03.480 --> 28:06.347
[fence rattling]

28:08.420 --> 28:09.773
- HE WENT THAT WAY!

28:09.820 --> 28:10.809
- I'M TRYING
TO STAY ALIVE, SHAWN.

28:10.850 --> 28:12.317
- GUS, THAT IS OUR KIDNAPPER.

28:12.350 --> 28:13.817
TRUST ME. I CAN SCALE THAT
IN A SINGLE LEAP.

28:13.860 --> 28:15.851
- WHAT?
SHAWN!

28:15.890 --> 28:18.779
- W-W-W-WAAAH!

28:22.930 --> 28:24.693
- SHAWN.

28:35.040 --> 28:36.371
- [groans]

28:36.410 --> 28:38.878
- WE LOST HIM!
- HE'S RIGHT BEHIND US.

28:38.910 --> 28:40.468
- I'M TALKING ABOUT THE GUY
WE'RE CHASING.

28:40.510 --> 28:43.741
- I'M TALKING ABOUT THE GUY
CHASING US.

28:50.830 --> 28:53.128
- GUS, MY SPIRITUAL SENSES
ARE OUT OF CONTROL.

28:53.160 --> 28:55.424
I CAN'T BELIEVE I DIDN'T TURN
TO EASTERN CULTURE EARLIER.

28:55.460 --> 28:58.224
- SHAWN, WE GOT LUCKY BECAUSE
WE HID LIKE LITTLE GIRLS.

28:58.270 --> 29:00.363
- GUS, DON'T BE
THE TEN TIGERS OF CANTON.

29:00.400 --> 29:03.289
WE'VE REACHED A NEW LEVEL.

29:07.340 --> 29:10.946
I REST MY CASE.

29:33.430 --> 29:35.136
- COULDN'T GET
A CLEAR SHOT OF HIM.

29:35.170 --> 29:36.797
IT'S ALMOST AS IF HE KNEW
THERE WERE CAMERAS THERE.

29:36.840 --> 29:38.535
- DUDE, THAT'S IT.

29:38.570 --> 29:40.561
THAT'S HER JACKET.
WE FOUND HER.

29:40.610 --> 29:42.931
- I'LL CALL THE POLICE.
- NO, NO, NO, GUS.

29:42.980 --> 29:44.971
THAT WAS SO US LAST WEEK.

29:45.010 --> 29:48.548
WE'VE BEEN RIDING EVERYONE'S
COATTAILS THIS WHOLE TIME.

29:48.580 --> 29:50.571
I SAY WE TAKE HIM DOWN NOW.

29:50.620 --> 29:53.111
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN NOW?
SHAWN!

29:55.590 --> 29:58.081
- WAAAH!

30:12.210 --> 30:14.371
- ARE YOU COMING IN OR WHAT?
- I WAS WAITING.

30:14.410 --> 30:16.002
- IT'S BEEN TEN MINUTES.
I COULD BE DEAD ALREADY.

30:16.040 --> 30:17.200
- IF YOU RECALL,
I DIDN'T WANT TO GO

30:17.240 --> 30:18.901
IN THERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

30:18.950 --> 30:20.201
- SO YOU LEAVE ME IN THERE
WITH OUR SUSPECT?

30:20.250 --> 30:22.013
WHAT WAS YOUR PLAN EXACTLY?

30:22.050 --> 30:23.176
- I WAS WAITING TO HEAR
IF THERE WAS ANY SCREAMING.

30:23.220 --> 30:24.414
THEN, DEPENDING
ON HOW BAD IT SOUNDED,

30:24.450 --> 30:25.485
I WOULD GO FORWARD FROM THERE.

30:25.520 --> 30:26.919
AND IF THERE WAS ANY PLEADING,

30:26.950 --> 30:28.019
THAT WAS ALSO A VARIABLE.

30:28.060 --> 30:30.153
- HOLY CRAP.
ARE YOU CHECKING EMAIL?

30:30.190 --> 30:32.078
- I NEED TO BE PRODUCTIVE
WHEN I GET NERVOUS, SHAWN.

30:32.130 --> 30:35.224
- JUST COME ON.
GOD BLESS!

30:35.260 --> 30:38.297
GUS, THIS IS SANG TAN.

30:38.330 --> 30:40.366
HIS FATHER IS THE LEADER
OF THE DRAGON TRIAD.

30:40.400 --> 30:42.539
THIS IS THE LOVELY BEKKI.

30:42.570 --> 30:44.299
AND THEY ARE IN LOVE.

30:44.340 --> 30:46.228
- AND YOUR FATHER'S THE LEADER
OF THE GOLDEN TRIAD?

30:46.270 --> 30:48.477
I GET IT.
IT'S ROMEO AND JULIET.

30:48.510 --> 30:49.909
- KIND OF.

30:49.940 --> 30:51.441
- OUR RELATIONSHIP
WAS DISCOVERED.

30:51.480 --> 30:53.072
I HAD TO GET HER SAFE.

30:53.110 --> 30:55.578
PEOPLE DIE FROM THESE KIND
OF INDISCRETIONS.

30:55.620 --> 30:58.088
I WENT TO HER IN THE ALLEY,
AND WE RAN.

30:58.120 --> 30:59.212
THINGS GOT OUT OF CONTROL.

30:59.250 --> 31:00.615
- YOU NEED TO TELL THE POLICE

31:00.650 --> 31:02.083
THAT THIS IS NOT A KIDNAPPING.

31:02.120 --> 31:03.485
- IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

31:03.520 --> 31:05.158
- IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE.

31:05.190 --> 31:06.953
- I'M PREGNANT.

31:06.990 --> 31:08.423
- [whistles]

31:08.460 --> 31:11.099
- MY FATHER WILL NEVER STAND
FOR THIS.

31:11.130 --> 31:14.031
I'VE BEEN CHOSEN TO TAKE OVER
FOR HIM WHEN HE RETIRES.

31:14.070 --> 31:15.230
THERE'S NO CHANGING THAT PLAN.

31:15.270 --> 31:18.103
I JUST NEED A DAY
TO GET SOME CASH

31:18.140 --> 31:19.664
AND GET SOME THINGS
IN ORDER.

31:19.710 --> 31:21.371
YOU'RE PART CHINESE, SHAWN.
YOU MUST UNDERSTAND.

31:21.410 --> 31:22.900
- YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT I DO.

31:22.940 --> 31:24.601
- YOU TOLD HIM
YOU WERE CHINESE?

31:24.650 --> 31:26.072
- GUS, I AM PART CHINESE...

31:26.110 --> 31:27.646
NOW.

31:27.680 --> 31:30.478
- WE'LL NEVER MAKE IT
LIKE THIS.

31:30.520 --> 31:32.044
CAN YOU HELP US?

31:32.090 --> 31:33.955
- OF COURSE WE WILL.
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.

31:35.390 --> 31:37.517
- LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT,
MR. SPENCER.

31:37.560 --> 31:39.949
YOU'RE SAYING THAT WE SHOULD
STOP THE INVESTIGATION.

31:39.990 --> 31:41.651
- YES, INDEED.

31:41.700 --> 31:43.998
CHIEF, I AM SENSING
THAT THERE IS MORE GOING ON HERE

31:44.030 --> 31:45.065
THAN MEETS THE EYE.

31:45.100 --> 31:46.192
- WELL,
THAT'S CERTAINLY A TACTIC

31:46.230 --> 31:48.061
THAT WE'VE NEVER TRIED BEFORE.

31:48.100 --> 31:50.034
AND WHAT
ARE YOU ALSO SUGGESTING--

31:50.070 --> 31:52.368
THAT WE CROSS OUR FINGERS
AND PERHAPS HOPE FOR THE BEST?

31:52.410 --> 31:54.139
- I HAVE AN IDEA
OF WHAT WE COULD DO.

31:54.180 --> 31:55.533
- SHH. GUS, DON'T.
DON'T DO IT.

31:55.580 --> 31:59.038
DON'T--CHIEF.
BEFORE, MOMENTS AGO,

31:59.080 --> 32:00.342
IT WAS FUZZY.

32:00.380 --> 32:02.712
I'M UPGRADING IT
TO CRYSTAL CLEAR.

32:02.750 --> 32:05.048
WAIT, I WANT TO BE SURE.

32:05.090 --> 32:07.217
YES, CRYSTAL CLEAR.
THIS IS NOT A KIDNAPPING.

32:07.250 --> 32:09.059
- REALLY?
IF IT'S NOT A KIDNAPPING,

32:09.090 --> 32:11.422
WHY DID WE JUST GET THIS?

32:18.200 --> 32:20.566
- WAIT.

32:20.600 --> 32:22.158
I'M GETTING SOMETHING ELSE.

32:22.200 --> 32:25.408
LOOK, I'M TELLING YOU
I'M RIGHT.

32:25.440 --> 32:27.704
I KNOW SHE WAS HERE.
SHE WAS STANDING RIGHT HERE.

32:27.740 --> 32:30.106
I CAN SEE IT PLAIN AS DAY--

32:30.140 --> 32:31.698
RIGHT NEXT TO THE MAN
WHO SOME BELIEVE

32:31.750 --> 32:34.014
TO BE HER KIDNAPPER.
- HOW SURE ARE YOU?

32:34.050 --> 32:36.416
- AS SURE AS I AM THAT THE GUY
WHO JUST FRIENDED GUS ONLINE

32:36.450 --> 32:38.145
IS NOT THE GUY
WHO PLAYED R2-D2.

32:38.190 --> 32:39.748
- HIS NAME
IS KENNY BAKER, SHAWN.

32:39.790 --> 32:41.587
- FINE. WHY WOULD KENNY BAKER
WANT TO BE FRIENDS WITH YOU?

32:41.620 --> 32:43.087
- WHY WOULD ELVIRA
WANT TO BE FRIENDS WITH YOU?

32:43.120 --> 32:44.724
- HER NAME
IS CASSANDRA PETERSON.

32:44.760 --> 32:46.284
- OKAY, WE FOUND
BEKKI CHIANG'S BRACELET,

32:46.330 --> 32:47.752
A FEW OTHER BELONGINGS.

32:47.790 --> 32:50.054
SHE WAS INDEED HERE,
SO GOOD WORK, MR. SPENCER.

32:50.100 --> 32:52.022
- THANK YOU.
- JUST A LITTLE LATE.

32:52.070 --> 32:54.630
- CHIEF, LOOK AT THIS.

32:54.670 --> 32:57.138
- WHAT IS IT?
- IT'S TRACES OF BLOOD.

33:03.240 --> 33:04.571
- YOU WERE HERE,
WEREN'T YOU?

33:04.610 --> 33:06.100
- YEAH, A LITTLE.
- YOU HAD TO GO OUT

33:06.150 --> 33:07.742
AND PLAY PSYCHIC,
AND NOW THE GIRL MIGHT BE DEAD.

33:07.780 --> 33:09.577
- TRUST ME, DAD. THERE ARE A LOT
OF THINGS IN PLAY HERE.

33:09.620 --> 33:12.111
SHE DIDN'T GET KIDNAPPED.
SHE RAN OFF WITH THE GUY.

33:12.150 --> 33:14.015
SHE'S IN LOVE
WITH A DRAGON TRIAD,

33:14.060 --> 33:15.254
AND HERE'S THE KICKER--

33:15.290 --> 33:17.212
GUESS WHO THE LEADER
OF THE GOLDEN TRIADS IS.

33:17.260 --> 33:19.319
- ARTHUR CHIANG.
- YOU KNEW THAT?

33:19.360 --> 33:20.782
- OF COURSE I KNEW THAT.

33:20.830 --> 33:23.094
COPS HAVE BEEN TRYING
TO NAIL HIM FOR YEARS, SHAWN.

33:23.130 --> 33:24.722
WHY DO YOU THINK I DIDN'T WANT
TO LET YOU IN ON THIS CASE?

33:24.770 --> 33:26.419
- DO NOT SAY
YOU'RE PROTECTING ME.

33:26.470 --> 33:28.062
- I WASN'T PROTECTING YOU.

33:28.100 --> 33:30.398
BUT THESE ARE SERIOUSLY
DANGEROUS PEOPLE, SHAWN.

33:30.440 --> 33:33.102
- DAD, YOU'RE NOT LISTENING
TO ME. I'VE GOT THIS.

33:33.140 --> 33:34.801
IT'S ROMEO AND JULIET, MAN.
IT'S WEST SIDE STORY.

33:34.840 --> 33:36.307
I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE
IS THE JETS

33:36.340 --> 33:37.637
AND WHICH ONE IS THE DOLPHINS.
- SHARKS.

33:37.680 --> 33:39.545
- THAT IS ALL
THAT IS GOING ON HERE.

33:39.580 --> 33:41.218
- AND HOW EXACTLY
DO YOU KNOW ALL THIS?

33:41.250 --> 33:42.512
- SHE TOLD ME.

33:42.550 --> 33:45.348
- SHE TOLD YOU.
AH.

33:45.390 --> 33:47.039
ANY CHANCE SHE SAID IT
UNDER DURESS?

33:47.090 --> 33:49.058
- I CAUGHT THEM KISSING.

33:49.090 --> 33:50.751
- AH.
DID HE HAVE A GUN?

33:50.790 --> 33:53.088
- OH, I'M ASSUMING NOT.

33:53.130 --> 33:54.825
- THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, SHAWN.

33:54.860 --> 33:56.691
YOU GOT PLAYED, KID.
- WHAT?

33:56.730 --> 33:58.766
- NOW GO HOME.
YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH.

34:01.240 --> 34:05.062
- THAT DOESN'T EVEN--
I KNOW WHAT I SAW.

34:05.110 --> 34:07.328
- THEY LIED TO US.
- THEY DIDN'T LIE.

34:07.370 --> 34:08.803
- MAYBE THEY WERE IN IT
TOGETHER.

34:08.840 --> 34:10.603
THEY NEEDED MONEY.

34:10.640 --> 34:12.801
THEY FLEECED YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE
EITHER ROMANTIC OR STUPID.

34:12.850 --> 34:14.545
- I KNOW WHEN PEOPLE
ARE IN LOVE.

34:14.580 --> 34:16.309
- WHAT NOW, GUYS?

34:16.350 --> 34:17.669
- YOU KNOW
ROMEO AND JULIET, RIGHT?

34:17.720 --> 34:18.846
DICAPRIO AND DAN ES?

34:18.890 --> 34:21.279
- IT'S A PLAY TOO.
- SURE IT IS.

34:21.320 --> 34:23.379
WHAT IF I SAID BEKKI CHIANG
GOT MIXED UP WITH THE TRIADS,

34:23.420 --> 34:25.786
THE GOLDEN ONES, AND FELL
IN LOVE WITH A DRAGON?

34:25.830 --> 34:27.627
SHE DIDN'T GET KIDNAPPED.

34:27.660 --> 34:29.799
SHE'S OUT THERE MAKING
KISSY FACE WITH HER GUY PAL.

34:29.830 --> 34:31.559
- THERE'S
A RANSOM NOTE, SHAWN.

34:31.600 --> 34:34.137
- AHA!
YOU ARE FOLLOWING THE CASE.

34:34.170 --> 34:36.638
- ONLY ENOUGH TO KNOW
THAT YOU'RE WRONG.

34:38.910 --> 34:40.559
- REALLY?
IF IT'S NOT A KIDNAPPING,

34:40.610 --> 34:41.577
WHY DID WE JUST GET HIS?

34:41.610 --> 34:43.635
- WAIT A MINUTE.

34:43.680 --> 34:46.843
THAT WAS NO RANSOM NOTE.
NO MONEY WAS ASKED FOR.

34:46.880 --> 34:48.472
- I DON'T FOLLOW YOU.

34:48.520 --> 34:50.249
- THAT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE, SHAWN.

34:50.280 --> 34:52.180
WHY WOULD HE SEND A PHOTO
THAT'S GOING TO INCITE A PANIC?

34:52.220 --> 34:53.289
- WHO'S HE?
- ROMEO.

34:53.320 --> 34:54.753
- THE SON.
- THE SON?

34:54.790 --> 34:56.519
- THE TAN FAMILY.
- WHICH ONE?

34:56.560 --> 34:58.448
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN "WHICH ONE"?
- THERE ARE TWO.

34:58.490 --> 35:00.378
- TWO?
- TWO SONS.

35:00.430 --> 35:05.265
THIS IS SANG TAN.
HE'S NUMBER TWO IN THE GANG.

35:05.300 --> 35:08.895
NOW, THIS IS THE OTHER BROTHER.
WHICH ONE DID YOU MEET?

35:08.940 --> 35:10.692
- I MET THEM BOTH.

35:10.740 --> 35:12.139
- TENO IS AN ENFORCER.

35:12.170 --> 35:13.728
HE'S SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE.

35:13.770 --> 35:16.136
- THIS GUY'S THE TOUGHEST MEMBER
OF THE CREW BY FAR.

35:16.180 --> 35:18.239
WHY ISN'T HE NEXT IN LINE?
- HE'S A BIG PROBLEM.

35:18.280 --> 35:20.771
HE CROSSES TERRITORIAL LINES.
THIS GUY LIKES TO POKE THE BEAR.

35:20.810 --> 35:23.415
THE GOLDENS AND THE DRAGONS
HAVE BEEN AT PEACE FOR A WHILE.

35:23.450 --> 35:25.748
THIS GUY HAS A HISTORY
OF INCITING TROUBLE.

35:25.790 --> 35:27.815
THE ONLY REASON TENO
MAKES SENSE AS A LEADER

35:27.850 --> 35:30.216
IS IN A TIME OF WAR
BETWEEN THE TRIADS.

35:30.260 --> 35:32.751
AND I DON'T SEE THAT HAPPENING
ANYTIME SOON.

35:34.400 --> 35:35.890
- OUR RELATIONSHIP
WAS DISCOVERED.

35:35.930 --> 35:37.420
I HAD TO GET HER SAFE.

35:37.460 --> 35:38.620
-IDO.

35:38.670 --> 35:40.467
AND I KNOW
WHO KIDNAPPED THE GIRL.

35:44.970 --> 35:47.609
- SHAWN,
THIS IS A BAD IDEA.

35:47.640 --> 35:49.528
- COME ON, GUS. WE GOT THIS.
IT'S THE BROTHERS.

35:49.580 --> 35:52.743
AND I JUST REALIZED WHAT YOU DO
WHEN BROTHERS ARE FIGHTING.

35:52.780 --> 35:54.338
- WHAT?

35:54.380 --> 35:57.770
- YOU TELL THEIR DAD.

35:57.820 --> 35:59.310
- I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU CALLED A MEETING

35:59.350 --> 36:00.942
WITH THE HEAD
OF THE DRAGON TRIADS.

36:00.990 --> 36:02.412
- SUMMIT MEETING.

36:02.460 --> 36:04.257
IT WAS RELATIVELY EASY
AFTER I REVEALED

36:04.290 --> 36:06.520
I HAD JAW-DROPPING INFORMATION
ABOUT HIS TWO SONS.

36:06.560 --> 36:09.358
- JUST GET TO IT.
- HI, THERE...

36:09.400 --> 36:11.618
MR. HAN TAN.

36:11.670 --> 36:14.332
OR IS IT MR. TAN HAN?

36:14.370 --> 36:16.292
SEE, I GET CONFUSED,

36:16.340 --> 36:18.604
BECAUSE THE BACK OF YAO MING'S
JERSEY SAYS YAO, NOT MING.

36:18.640 --> 36:19.800
- SHAWN.
- LET ME START OFF

36:19.840 --> 36:23.230
BY SAYING I LOVE PING-PONG

36:23.280 --> 36:24.907
AND GENERAL CHAO'S CHICKEN

36:24.950 --> 36:27.373
AND YOUR VERSION OF CHECKERS.

36:27.410 --> 36:29.776
I FIND YOUR FIRE DRILLS
TO BE IMMENSELY ENTERTAINING.

36:29.820 --> 36:31.481
DAVID BOWIE'S CHINA GIRL...

36:31.520 --> 36:33.385
- THE NAKED VERSION.
- THAT GOES WITHOUT SAYING.

36:33.420 --> 36:36.514
I HAVE ALSO PRACT ICED
THE ANCIENT MARTIAL ART

36:36.560 --> 36:38.619
OF WUSHU...

36:38.660 --> 36:40.685
UNDER THE TUTELAGE
OF YOUR FINE PEOPLE.

36:40.730 --> 36:44.325
- SHAWN, GET ON WITH IT.
- I AM ENDEARING MYSELF TO HIM.

36:44.370 --> 36:46.861
- STOP ENDEARING.

36:46.900 --> 36:49.733
- YOUR SON WANTS TO START A WAR
BETWEEN THE TRIADS.

36:53.310 --> 36:55.801
TENO, THE MEAN ONE.

36:55.840 --> 36:58.377
MAYBE YOU HAVE YOUR OWN WAY
OF DIFFERENTIATING THEM,

36:58.410 --> 37:01.243
BUT FOR ME, PERSONALLY,
I THINK HE'S THE MEANEST.

37:01.280 --> 37:04.511
MAYBE IT'S THE TATTOO
OR JUST THE GENERAL DEMEANOR.

37:04.550 --> 37:06.017
USE OF BROW.

37:06.050 --> 37:07.711
SOMETIMES YOU JUST GET A VIBE
ABOUT SOMEONE.

37:07.750 --> 37:09.308
- SHAWN.

37:09.360 --> 37:11.282
- HOLD THAT THOUGHT.

37:11.330 --> 37:14.390
- I DON'T THINK
HE SPEAKS ANY ENGLISH.

37:14.430 --> 37:15.727
- OH.

37:15.760 --> 37:18.263
THANK GOD.
I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST ME.

37:18.300 --> 37:19.460
- WHAT DO WE DO?

37:19.500 --> 37:21.297
- I HAVE SET PLAN "B"
IN MOTION,

37:21.340 --> 37:22.989
AND UNTIL THEN,
WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO USE

37:23.040 --> 37:25.429
THE INTERNATIONAL METHOD
OF COMMUNICATION.

37:25.470 --> 37:26.869
- YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO ATTEMPT CHARADES, ARE YOU?

37:26.910 --> 37:30.334
- ONE WORD!
- OH, MY GOSH.

37:32.410 --> 37:34.048
- WEST SIDE STORY.

37:34.080 --> 37:37.413
- THAT'S THREE WORDS.
- YOUR SON SANG...

37:37.450 --> 37:40.510
THE NICE ONE,
DARK SWEATSHIRT,

37:40.550 --> 37:44.350
IS IN LOVE
WITH MR. CHIANG'S DAUGHTER,

37:44.390 --> 37:47.427
ALSO NICE.
- VERY NICE.

37:47.460 --> 37:49.428
- UH, HERE'S THE PART
YOU WON'T LIKE.

37:49.460 --> 37:52.020
SHE IS PREGNANT,
PREGGERS,

37:52.070 --> 37:54.391
WITH YOUR GRANDBABY.

37:54.440 --> 37:58.467
THERE IS A CHINESE BUN
IN THE OVEN.

37:58.510 --> 38:01.434
SHE'S ACTUALLY NOT SHOWING YET.
THERE'S NOT A BUMP AT ALL.

38:01.480 --> 38:03.630
SAFE TO SAY THAT WE'RE STILL
IN THE FIRST TRIMESTER NOW.

38:03.680 --> 38:06.308
- SHAWN, THIS IS NOT WORKING.
- I AM WORKING MY BUTT OFF.

38:06.350 --> 38:08.443
HE'S GIVING ME NOTHING!

38:08.480 --> 38:10.345
- I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!
- DON'T WORRY.

38:10.380 --> 38:11.938
I CAN HEAR PLAN "B"
RIGHT OUTSIDE.

38:11.990 --> 38:15.756
- I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING, MAN.
WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE DOING?

38:15.790 --> 38:18.679
OH, GO SUCK YOURSELVES.

38:18.730 --> 38:20.948
- THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE, KEN.

38:20.990 --> 38:23.356
- WHY AM I HERE?
- WE NEED A TRANSLATOR.

38:23.400 --> 38:25.595
- WE SOLVED THE CASE.
- BUT WE CAN'T TELL ANYBODY.

38:25.630 --> 38:27.769
- AND THEY CAN'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT WE'RE SAYING.

38:27.800 --> 38:30.337
- DUDE, I SPEAK
NINE WORDS OF CHINESE.

38:30.370 --> 38:32.099
SIX OF THOSE ARE NUMBERS.

38:32.140 --> 38:34.631
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S NOT PANIC.
I THINK WE CAN USE THIS.

38:34.680 --> 38:36.830
WHICH NUMBERS DO YOU KNOW?
- ENOUGH!

38:36.880 --> 38:38.643
I UNDERSTAND YOU.

38:38.680 --> 38:40.375
- YOU DO?

38:40.410 --> 38:43.971
MAN, YOU LET...

38:44.020 --> 38:47.808
MR. HAN...TAN...HAN...

38:47.850 --> 38:48.851
- SHAWN.

38:48.890 --> 38:51.723
- YOU HAVE SPENT TEN LONG YEARS

38:51.760 --> 38:53.625
WORKING VERY HARD
TO KEEP PEACE

38:53.660 --> 38:56.788
BETWEEN YOURSELF
AND THE GOLDEN TRIADS.

38:56.830 --> 39:01.028
AND YOUR SON TENO
WANTS TO RIP IT APART.

39:01.070 --> 39:04.608
IF YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS,
YOU HAVE TO TELL US.

39:04.640 --> 39:08.371
- IF I'M FOUND
WITH THE KIDNAPPED GIRL...

39:08.410 --> 39:12.699
THE BLOODSHED WILL NEVER STOP.

39:12.750 --> 39:14.069
WE CANNOT GET INVOLVED.

39:14.110 --> 39:16.044
- RIGHT.

39:16.080 --> 39:19.789
BUT WE CAN.

39:19.820 --> 39:23.381
SO IF YOU KNOW
WHERE HE IS,

39:23.420 --> 39:25.024
YOU GOT TO GIVE HIM UP.

39:29.100 --> 39:31.989
I'M ABOUT TO SOLVE A KIDNAPPING.
I NEED YOU TO BRING BACKUP.

39:32.030 --> 39:34.533
- SHAWN, CALL LASSITER.
- NOPE. NOT DOING IT.

39:34.570 --> 39:36.435
- STOP IT. I AM NOT COMING.
- NOPE.

39:36.470 --> 39:38.609
IT'S GOT TO BE YOU.
LISTEN, JULES...

39:38.640 --> 39:40.403
YIN CAME
AI-TER ME TOO, OKAY?

39:40.440 --> 39:42.829
I'M NOT GONNA LET THIS GUY
KEEP ME FROM LIVING.

39:42.880 --> 39:44.643
I NEED YOU,
OR I GO DOWN ALONE.

39:44.680 --> 39:46.648
WELL, WITH GUS.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

39:58.830 --> 40:01.799
YOU ALL RIGHT?
- HE'S JUST OUTSIDE.

40:01.830 --> 40:03.149
- WAKE UP.
WAKE UP.

40:03.200 --> 40:05.191
WE NEED YOU.
WAKE UP, SANG.

40:05.230 --> 40:07.095
- GUS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- I'M TRYING TO WAKE HIM UP.

40:07.130 --> 40:09.064
WE NEED HIM TO HELP US ESCAPE.
- I TOLD YOU, MAN.

40:09.100 --> 40:10.795
I'VE GOT US COVERED.
- DON'T SAY IT, SHAWN.

40:10.840 --> 40:12.205
YOU ARE NOT A KUNG FU EXPERT.

40:12.240 --> 40:14.128
- TECHNICALLY, NO, NOT YET.

40:14.170 --> 40:17.003
BUT I DIDN'T SHOW
YOU THIS, MAN.

40:17.040 --> 40:19.543
TH ESE ARE MOSTLY
JUST STRETCH ES,

40:19.580 --> 40:23.846
BUT THERE'S SOME LETHAL
COMBINATIONS HERE ON PAGE THREE.

40:23.880 --> 40:26.440
TENO...

40:26.490 --> 40:28.788
WE GOT YOU.

40:28.820 --> 40:30.549
I FIGURED IT ALL OUT.
- REALLY?

40:30.590 --> 40:33.457
- YEAH, REALLY.

40:33.490 --> 40:35.720
YOU FELT BETRAYED
BY YOUR BROTHER HERE, RIGHT?

40:35.760 --> 40:38.149
MORE THAN THAT,
YOU WERE JEALOUS

40:38.200 --> 40:40.521
THAT YOU WEREN'T SELECTED
TO TAKE OVER.

40:40.570 --> 40:44.028
SEE, SANG'S A LITTLE SOl-T
IN YOUR EYES, ISN'T HE?

40:44.070 --> 40:46.868
UNFIT TO LEAD.

40:46.910 --> 40:49.231
BUT A WAR BETWEEN THE TRIADS,

40:49.280 --> 40:52.602
THAT WOULD BE
YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO SHINE--

40:52.650 --> 40:54.572
TENO, THE ENFORCER.

40:54.620 --> 40:58.579
YOU KNEW WHO IT WAS THE NIGHT
WE LEI-T, ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

40:58.620 --> 40:59.917
THIS IS THE GUY
THAT'S STEALING STUFF.

40:59.950 --> 41:01.679
- YEAH, THE SAFE
WAS ALREADY OPEN.

41:01.720 --> 41:03.915
- WHICH HE DIDN'T HAVE TO CRACK,
WHICH MEANS HE'S A PRO.

41:03.960 --> 41:06.087
- AND HE STOLE A JACKET, WHICH
IS A WEIRD THING TO STEAL.

41:06.130 --> 41:08.257
- YOU WERE THE ONE
WHO DISCOVERED THAT YOUR BROTHER

41:08.290 --> 41:11.919
WAS CONSORTING
WITH YOUR MOST HATED ENEMY.

41:11.970 --> 41:14.188
- OUR RELATIONSHIP
WAS DISCOVERED.

41:14.230 --> 41:15.959
- AND WE LED YOU
RIGHT TO HIM.

41:16.000 --> 41:19.265
- HE'S RIGHT BEHIND US!

41:19.310 --> 41:22.802
- YOU BROKE INTO THAT ROOM,
AND YOU TOOK MATTERS

41:22.840 --> 41:25.775
INTO YOUR OWN HANDS.

41:25.810 --> 41:27.539
[loud thud]

41:27.580 --> 41:32.188
'CAUSE LUCKILY KIDNAPPING
FELL RIGHT IN YOUR LAP.

41:32.220 --> 41:35.018
AND ALL YOU HAD TO DO
WAS SNAP A RANSOM PHOTO,

41:35.060 --> 41:39.156
MAKE UP ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO PUT
THE BLAME ON YOUR BROTHER THERE,

41:39.190 --> 41:40.919
AND WAIT.

41:40.960 --> 41:44.896
WAIT FOR A WAR THAT YOU HAD
ALWAYS WANTED TO START.

41:47.700 --> 41:49.167
OH, RELAX, DUDE.

41:49.200 --> 41:50.633
- [exhales deeply]

41:50.670 --> 41:52.103
- WHOA. WITH THE MOUTH.
- WAAAH.

41:52.140 --> 41:54.529
- DUDE, I HAVE MADE IT
THROUGH ALL SEVEN LEVELS

41:54.580 --> 41:56.104
OF SHAQ FU ON NINTENDO.

41:56.140 --> 41:57.869
AND GUS CAN ATTEST TO THAT.

41:57.910 --> 42:00.208
- SANG, WAKE UP.

42:00.250 --> 42:02.241
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO THIS.

42:02.280 --> 42:03.713
HWAH!

42:03.750 --> 42:05.240
- CHA!

42:05.290 --> 42:07.611
- TWEE!

42:07.650 --> 42:13.179
I EXECUTE THIS PROPERLY,
NO CAN DEFEND.

42:25.270 --> 42:27.738
- YOU GOT IT, SHAWN.
YOU GOT IT.

42:27.770 --> 42:29.328
- * WASTIN' TIME

42:29.380 --> 42:31.575
* ON MY OWN...

42:31.610 --> 42:33.271
- HELP IS ON THE WAY!
- HA!

42:33.310 --> 42:35.915
- ANY MINUTE NOW, SHAWN.

42:35.950 --> 42:38.214
- YOUR SENSEI TEACH YOU
HOW TO FIGHT WITH A STICK?

42:38.250 --> 42:40.741
- YEAH.

42:40.790 --> 42:43.054
- BE LIKE WATER, SHAWN!

42:47.260 --> 42:49.194
I GOT YOUR BACK, SHAWN!

42:52.070 --> 42:54.766
CROUCHING TIGER, SHAWN,
CROUCHING TIGER!

42:54.800 --> 42:59.965
*

43:00.010 --> 43:03.275
HELP IS COMING!
HELP IS COMING!

43:03.310 --> 43:04.902
FISTS OF FURY!

43:04.950 --> 43:07.339
FISTS OF FURY!

43:07.380 --> 43:09.268
WUSHU FINGER!

43:10.320 --> 43:12.880
- YOU'RE NOT HELPING!

43:16.820 --> 43:18.287
- I'M COMING.

43:18.320 --> 43:26.819
*

43:26.870 --> 43:29.088
[punch landing]

43:29.140 --> 43:31.358
-AAH!

43:34.010 --> 43:37.138
AAH!

43:37.180 --> 43:39.307
OH, MAN.

43:42.020 --> 43:44.341
REALLY?

43:47.850 --> 43:51.286
OH.
GOOD WORK, JULES.

43:51.320 --> 43:54.255
YEAH, HE HAD JUST SURRENDERED
BEFORE YOU GOT HERE.

43:54.290 --> 43:59.023
- UM, HE SURRENDERED
WHEN I WALKED IN, SHAWN.

44:00.370 --> 44:02.031
- OH, GOD.

44:04.810 --> 44:07.904
YOU KNOW, DAD, NONE OF THIS
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED

44:07.940 --> 44:10.204
IF YOU JUST HAD LET ME
TAKE KARATE LESSONS AS A KID.

44:10.240 --> 44:12.174
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
I GET IT.

44:12.210 --> 44:14.041
YOU SAW THAT I HAD
TOO MUCH POTENTIAL, DIDN'T YOU?

44:14.080 --> 44:17.345
YOU KNEW THAT I WOULD BE
WAY TOO DANGEROUS TO TRAIN.

44:17.380 --> 44:19.041
- SHAWN, I DIDN'T LET YOU
TAKE KARATE

44:19.090 --> 44:20.785
BECAUSE YOU HAD ZERO CONTROL
OF YOUR BODY.

44:20.820 --> 44:22.287
- I HAD TOO MUCH CONTROL
OF MY BODY.

44:22.320 --> 44:23.389
- ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

44:23.420 --> 44:24.455
YOU USED TO RUN AROUND
KARATE-CHOPPING

44:24.490 --> 44:26.185
EVERYTHING IN THE HOUSE.

44:26.230 --> 44:27.219
I THOUGHT YOU'D KILL YOURSELF.
- ALL RIGHT.

44:27.260 --> 44:29.421
AGREE TO DISAGREE.
BUT KNOW THIS.

44:29.460 --> 44:31.223
FROM NOW ON, I CAN HANDLE
THE ROUGH STUFF, OKAY?

44:31.260 --> 44:34.229
I'M MY OWN PERSON.
MY BODY'S A WEAPON.

44:34.270 --> 44:35.828
I DON'T NEED YOU
TO PROTECT ME, OKAY?

44:35.870 --> 44:37.189
- FAIR ENOUGH.

44:37.240 --> 44:40.437
BUT IN RETURN,
YOU NEVER PUT ME IN A POSITION

44:40.470 --> 44:42.108
OF HAVING TO LIE FOR YOU.

44:42.140 --> 44:43.437
THIS ISN'T JUST
ABOUT YOU ANYMORE, KID.

44:43.480 --> 44:45.107
I'M A PLAYER
IN THIS GAME TOO.

44:45.150 --> 44:47.300
YOU FIND A VICTIM,
YOU FIND A PERPETRATOR,

44:47.350 --> 44:49.318
YOU CALL ME FIRST BEFORE YOU
PUT YOUR HAND TO YOUR HEAD.

44:49.350 --> 44:50.840
- FIRST?
- FIRST.

44:50.880 --> 44:53.280
- HOW ABOUT FIRST-ISH?
- NO!

44:53.320 --> 44:54.787
- THANKS.

44:54.820 --> 44:56.788
- I WAS ABOUT TO SAY
THE SAME THING TO YOU.

44:56.820 --> 44:58.412
- I MIGHT HAVE NEEDED A KICK
IN THE PANTS TO GET GOING.

44:58.460 --> 45:00.348
- I WOULD NEVER KICK YOU
IN THE PANTS.

45:00.390 --> 45:03.097
- YOU DIDN'T GIVE UP.
- AND I'LL NEVER GIVE UP.

45:03.130 --> 45:06.293
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
SHOULD WE HUG?

45:06.330 --> 45:07.820
- WE COULD.

45:07.870 --> 45:10.293
[footsteps approaching]
- THERE YOU ARE.

45:10.340 --> 45:12.467
- RAIN CHECK.
- THERE YOU ARE.

45:12.510 --> 45:14.899
CHIEF SAID YOU WERE WORKING
ON A SPECIAL PROJECT.

45:14.940 --> 45:16.407
THOUGHT YOU COULD WORK
ON THESE TOO.

45:16.440 --> 45:18.806
- OH, NOW YOU'RE GOING TO PLY ME
WITH ADDITIONAL WORK?

45:18.850 --> 45:21.307
CARLTON, THESE ARE YOUR TAXES.
- HEY, I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU.

45:21.350 --> 45:23.215
- AND THIS
IS HOW YOU HELP ME?

45:23.250 --> 45:26.048
- WELL, YOU'RE HERE, AREN'T YOU?
IT'S ALREADY WORKING.

45:26.090 --> 45:27.387
[loud thud]

45:27.420 --> 45:30.480
- MY SPINE MIGHT BE LIQUID.

45:30.520 --> 45:32.056
- DID YOU TELL THE COPS

45:32.090 --> 45:33.284
YOU SINGLE-HANDEDLY
TOOK OUT TENO TAN?

45:33.330 --> 45:34.888
- THAT WAS AN ASSUMPTION
THAT THEY MADE.

45:34.930 --> 45:37.228
- FROM WHAT?
- I MAY HAVE LEI-T OUT TWO VERBS,

45:37.260 --> 45:39.319
AN ADJECT IVE, AND THE WORDS
"JULIET ARRIVED."

45:39.370 --> 45:41.224
BUT OTHER THAN THAT,
IT WAS MOSTLY FACTS.

45:41.270 --> 45:43.033
- YOU REALIZE
YOU HAVE TO SIGN YOUR STATEMENT.

45:43.070 --> 45:44.492
- NOT IF WE LEAVE RIGHT NOW,
I DON'T.

45:44.540 --> 45:47.168
HOW ABOUT SOME PANDA EXPRESS?
- HAD THAT LAST NIGHT.

45:47.210 --> 45:48.529
- PICK UP STIX?
- HAD THAT THIS MORNING.

45:48.570 --> 45:51.107
- P.F. CHANG'S?
- YOU KNOW THAT'S RIGHT.

45:54.410 --> 45:56.219
- 52, TAKE TWO.
A-MARK.

45:56.250 --> 45:59.413
- ROLL.

46:05.260 --> 46:07.558
- * DEAD, ON MY HEAD

46:07.590 --> 46:09.455
* WASTIN' TIME

46:09.500 --> 46:13.823
* ON MY OWN...

46:13.870 --> 46:17.328
- GUS,
THOSE ARE CLEANING SUPPLIES.

46:17.370 --> 46:18.394
- ONE MORE TIME.

46:18.440 --> 46:23.002
[laughter]

46:23.040 --> 46:24.439
- YEAH, LET'S GO BACK
AND DO THAT AGAIN.

46:35.260 --> 46:37.979
- HE ASSUMED. I CALLED THIS
FROM A MILE AWAY.

46:38.020 --> 46:42.298
- HOLY CRAP.
YOU'RE DOING GOOD COP.

46:42.330 --> 46:44.093
[laughter]

46:45.370 --> 46:47.099
[glass breaking]

46:59.450 --> 47:01.577
WAAAH!

47:01.610 --> 47:05.614
W-W-W-WAAAH !

47:05.650 --> 47:08.619
WAAAH!

47:08.650 --> 47:11.619
WE CAN DO THIS
THE EASY WAY OR--

47:11.660 --> 47:13.981
- YOU MUST BE
OUT OF YOUR DAMN--

47:14.030 --> 47:17.056
- WE CAN DO THIS
THE EASY WAY OR--

47:17.100 --> 47:18.965
- YOU MUST BE
OUT OF YOUR DAMN--

47:19.000 --> 47:20.592
- WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?
- PUT YOUR SEATBELT ON, SHAWN.

47:20.630 --> 47:24.396
- OH, FOR CRYING--
JUST--JUST START THE...

47:28.940 --> 47:31.306
[laughs]
- WOW.

47:33.350 --> 47:35.147
- THAT'S ALL WE NEED, RIGHT?

47:35.180 --> 47:37.444
HEE!
